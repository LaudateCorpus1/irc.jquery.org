[00:03:19] <Cork> Jamesonwa: if you don't have anything better to go on, ya
[00:03:43] <Jamesonwa> yeah no other attributes other then href...
[00:04:07] <Cork> you could possibly go on parent
[00:04:29] <Jamesonwa> yeah no other attributes other then href...
[00:04:40] <Jamesonwa> ah, i suppose
[00:04:44] <Jamesonwa> im fairly new to jquery
[00:04:59] <Jamesonwa> what would be the parent selector?
[00:05:18] <Jamesonwa> jQuery( ":parent" ) ?
[00:51:09] * CssNoob good afternoon y'all
[01:46:16] <Technodrome> anyone here worked with jquery isotope?
[02:16:31] <mountains__> Hi all.  I'm trying to understand is this is jQuery-specific.  When I perform a jQuey.post() and send "refs: refs_array" as part of the data, the POST headers show the data as 'refs[]' as being sent---does jQuery perturb the names in the case of POSTing an array?  Only that seems crazy to me.
[02:17:30] <Cork> mountains__: when you give $.ajax/get/post an object it passes it to $.param
[02:17:42] <Cork> this function converts the object/array to a param string
[02:18:25] <Cork> and the name standard for param strings is to create arrays by converting something: [1,2,3] to something[]=1&something[]=2&something[]=3
[02:18:38] <Cork> and many servers expect this
[02:18:49] <Cork> (most?)
[02:22:07] <mountains__> Hmm.
[02:22:35] <mountains__> Why it can't just be multiples of the name, without the additional '[]' seems most unlikely to be a "server" thing; it's the client which will have to interpret it.
[02:23:10] <Cork> mountains__: cause then it can't separate arrays that should be converted to an array
[02:23:27] <Cork> from the same element existing multiple times where the last one should overwrite the earlier ones
[02:24:29] <mountains__> Yes, but why the naming change?  foo -> foo[]?
[02:24:34] <mountains__> That's just bizarre.
[02:25:00] <Cork> mountains__: its a form of foo[0] = 1, foo[1] = 2
[02:25:02] <mountains__> And now means all receivers have to know that it's not "foo", it's "foo[]", and that's not what was asked for originally.
[02:25:12] <Cork> like i said it needs to do it for the server to know it is an array
[02:25:29] <Cork> mountains__: all receivers expect this
[02:25:38] <Cork> or at least all that support standard param strings
[02:26:06] <Cork> mountains__: if you don't want it just don't give refs an array
[02:26:21] <Cork> give it a string or number and jquery won't append the []
[02:26:47] <Cork> but note that most servers will convert ref=1&ref=2 => ref=2
[02:26:50] <Cork> and remove ref=1
[02:41:40] <Uhkis> any idea how to stop the "blinking" of the overlapping div without changing the html? http://jsfiddle.net/fp7g34wu/
[02:43:04] <Cork> Uhkis: you would have to track the state manually
[02:43:12] <Cork> and it is a pain to do
[02:44:45] <Uhkis> typical
[02:45:36] <Cork> hmm
[02:45:52] <Cork> looks like jquery has added a fer extra properties to make this simpler
[02:45:53] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/fp7g34wu/1/
[02:45:59] <Cork> still kinda uggly
[02:46:01] <Cork> but it works
[02:46:28] <Cork> but ya, i would add a wrapping element around the two elements
[02:46:50] <Cork> you get a much less fradgile solution if you do
[02:48:52] <Uhkis> Cork: yeah, too bad the actual html is way way more complicated (Drupal)
[02:48:58] <djam90> Hi could anyone help me a sec? I have a ul > a > li (the list items are wrapped in a link) and the list appears when you type in the text box. So it is a search bar where the results appear below as you type. I want to be able to use the up and down arrow keys to navigate down the list. I have got the keyCode part working, I can do code when I press Down, but not sure how to "select" the top item in the list, and move down the list with each k
[02:48:58] <djam90> ey press?
[02:49:18] <Cork> Uhkis: well it isn't that hard to solve it
[02:49:39] <Cork> Uhkis: $(event.relatedTarget).closest('#second').length
[02:49:48] <Cork> should work even with child elements
[02:50:11] <Cork> djam90: separate the question from the story
[02:51:44] <Uhkis> Cork: thanks, ill keep on fighting :-)
[02:52:01] <djam90> Cork sorry. Story: ul > a > li elements. the ul appears when you type in the search bar. I want to be able to navigate down the ul list with keys up and down. I currently have this code: http://jsbin.com/naketucuze/1/edit?js,output
[02:52:16] <djam90> but my logic seems to not work correctly
[02:52:43] <djam90> i feel I am using the jQuery functions all wrong in that code
[02:52:45] <Cork> you have syntax errors in your code
[02:52:59] <Cork> not too hard to fix though
[02:53:26] <djam90> ah its missing the last closing brace
[02:54:04] <Cork> and some semicolon
[02:54:16] <djam90> yeah
[02:54:17] <djam90> fixed that
[02:54:39] <djam90> would you approach this task a different way?
[02:54:39] <Cork> anyway the html is needed to understand this code
[02:54:47] <djam90> hmm okay leme do a mockup
[02:54:49] <Cork> i would prob use tabindex
[02:56:41] <djam90> never heard of it
[02:58:43] <djam90> Does JSBIN have jQuery already added?
[02:59:38] <Uhkis> Cork: got it working, thanks a lot again :)
[03:00:35] <djam90> Cork: try this? http://jsbin.com/naketucuze/1/edit?html
[03:00:48] <djam90> in the text box, when you press down key, it works, press it again it works, press it again it breaks
[03:02:14] <Cork> man i hate jsbin now days...
[03:02:25] <djam90> me too haha
[03:02:33] <Cork> djam90: do tell when your done :)
[03:02:39] <djam90> ah sorry!
[03:02:41] <djam90> was it live updating?
[03:02:46] <Cork> har to test when it reloads every few seconds
[03:02:49] <Cork> apparently ya
[03:02:53] <djam90> ohhh. yeah I will leave it now
[03:02:58] <djam90> sorry
[03:03:49] <Cork> uh
[03:03:53] <Cork> your html is invalid
[03:04:07] <djam90> can't wrap an li inside a?
[03:04:33] <Cork> no
[03:04:41] <Cork> the only valid parent of li is <ul> or <ol>
[03:04:51] <Cork> and the other way around
[03:04:53] <djam90> hmm, ok I can strip out the a
[03:05:03] <djam90> just remove the <a>s
[03:05:11] <djam90> shall I do it now?
[03:05:37] <Xatenev> Heya
[03:05:45] <Xatenev> A short question: I got a div
[03:05:53] <Xatenev> inside that div are a lot of elements
[03:06:07] <Xatenev> I want to put an event listener on all of those elements
[03:06:16] <Xatenev> So I have to iterate through them - how can I iterate through all this elements?
[03:06:41] <Xatenev> Nvm, found the oslution :p
[03:06:43] <djam90> $('div').children().on('click', function(){ });
[03:07:03] <Xatenev> Thanks :)
[03:07:09] <Xatenev> this channel is so great btw :D
[03:09:52] <Cork> djam90: can the list have nested children?
[03:10:28] <djam90> Cork, hmm, I don't think so
[03:10:38] <djam90> would it be much different if it did
[03:14:11] <djam90> i never realised how much work was involved in creating UIs
[03:14:28] <Cork> gah..
[03:14:32] <Cork> fixed it and...
[03:14:39] <Cork> it didn't save...
[03:14:50] <djam90> :|
[03:15:03] <Cork> ok, i won't accept using jsbin from now on
[03:15:07] <Cork> too damn broken
[03:15:22] <djam90> is there something better?
[03:15:40] <Cork> jsfiddle
[03:15:48] <Cork> it can be overloaded from time to time
[03:15:57] <Cork> but it at least doesn't throw away your changes
[03:16:08] <Cork> anyway give me a min to redo everything
[03:16:23] <djam90> ok thanks I appreciate this
[03:21:45] <Cork> there we go
[03:21:45] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/seze4Lhj/3/
[03:22:05] <djam90> wow, such short code :|
[03:22:11] <djam90> its less than I had
[03:22:25] <Cork> should be about half
[03:22:58] <djam90> ok never seen .filter() before
[03:23:13] <Cork> djam90: it filters out elements from the match set
[03:23:18] <djam90> awesome way of grabbing the current selected one
[03:24:03] <djam90> lis.index(current)
[03:24:05] <djam90> what is that
[03:24:22] <Cork> it grabs the index in the lis array matching current
[03:24:26] <Cork> uh
[03:24:37] <Cork> it grabs the index of the element in lis matching current
[03:24:59] <Xatenev> Short question:
[03:25:04] <djam90> ah
[03:25:05] <djam90> I get it
[03:25:06] <Xatenev> what does exactly happen when i make an ajax call($.ajax
[03:25:11] <Xatenev> and write cache: 'true'
[03:25:17] <Xatenev> what does it exactly caches?
[03:25:19] <Cork> Xatenev: nothing
[03:25:25] <Xatenev> hmm? :D
[03:25:27] <Cork> cache: false does though
[03:25:42] <Cork> cache: false adds ?_=<timestamp> to the url
[03:25:50] <Xatenev> what should I use? :p
[03:26:02] <Cork> if you need to make a get call
[03:26:06] <Cork> and it has to not use cache
[03:26:09] <Cork> use cache: false
[03:26:14] <Xatenev> its post
[03:26:16] <Cork> else don't set it
[03:26:20] <Cork> post is never cached
[03:26:23] <Xatenev> so i just remove it
[03:26:23] <Xatenev> ^^
[03:26:26] <Cork> yes
[03:26:28] <Xatenev> okey thanks :)
[03:26:38] <Xatenev> this channel is so great haha :D
[03:27:05] <djam90> thanks Cork that code is awesome
[03:27:21] <Xatenev> Btw cork are u javascript developer? :P or freelancer or what are you doing?
[03:27:34] <Xatenev> (Cause ur just the javascript(jquery) god.) :p
[03:28:50] <Cork> Xatenev: i'm a "web developer"
[03:28:54] <Xatenev> Hmm? :P
[03:28:54] <Cork> and backend developer
[03:29:02] <Cork> and server automation developer
[03:29:05] <Cork> the full stack :)
[03:29:06] <Xatenev> xD
[03:29:08] <Xatenev> Cool stuff
[03:29:11] <Cork> <-- works for a hosting company
[03:29:24] <Xatenev> Im just wondering cause u know so much about this jquery stuff
[03:29:24] <Cork> and i make ppls orders on a website actually do things on the hardware
[03:29:34] <Cork> like start vps, create dns record
[03:29:35] <Xatenev> so I thought ur just doing js all day :d
[03:29:38] <Cork> registare domain

[03:29:42] <Xatenev> ah okey^^
[03:29:43] <Cork> and so on
[03:30:04] <Cork> i do js, bash, ruby, go, python and a tiny bit php
[03:30:10] <Cork> and some powershell
[03:30:11] <djam90> thats cool. I'm a web developer for a car dealership
[03:30:13] <Xatenev> go?
[03:30:15] <caraconan> Hi there. I need to re-factor this code: http://paste.debian.net/129544/ Basically I need to do 2 nested async db calls. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks
[03:30:21] <Cork> ?g golang
[03:30:22] <b-ot> Cork: The Go Programming Language → https://golang.org/
[03:30:36] <Xatenev> ah okey^^
[03:30:48] <Xatenev> Python is quite cool
[03:30:54] <Xatenev> and its nice what u can do with js these days lal^^
[03:30:58] <Cork> eh, not my fav
[03:31:06] <Cork> i like js a lot actually
[03:31:13] <Xatenev> yea its very cool
[03:31:14] <Cork> and go is my second best
[03:31:16] <djam90> I do mainly PHP and Laravel framework and any database stuff and talking to APIs and also because our front end developer is basically a glorified painter he doesn't know ANY javascript so I end up doing this too
[03:31:17] <Cork> ruby third
[03:31:18] <Xatenev> I just realize how cool JS is lol
[03:31:27] <Xatenev> Cause im just doing PHP Typo3 / SF2
[03:31:35] <Xatenev> But at the omment im doing a bit of frontend JS stuff^^
[03:31:42] <Xatenev> Its cool when things start working :D
[03:31:48] <Cork> true :)
[03:32:00] <Xatenev> U like angulaR?
[03:32:16] <djam90> haha I've done 2 projects in AngularJS
[03:32:22] <Xatenev> Is it cool?
[03:32:25] <Xatenev> it looks very nice :D
[03:32:43] <djam90> I found it extremely difficult learning curve and still struggle writing directives but the more you do it the easier it gets and its power is epic
[03:33:13] <Xatenev> Yea I know somebody whos writing a CMS for Symfony2 with angularjs at the moment
[03:33:20] <Xatenev> its like 20% PHP 80% JS(Angular) ^^
[03:33:31] <Xatenev> Weird but cool! :D
[03:33:36] <djam90> things that are easy in jQuery have to be properly wrapped into the Angular Way which makes things take longer
[03:33:51] <Xatenev> Well I like jquery for 2 things
[03:33:53] <Xatenev> DOM navigationa
[03:33:55] <Xatenev> and ajax^^
[03:34:07] <djam90> ajax is easier in Angular I would say
[03:34:10] <djam90> or perhaps
[03:34:13] <Xatenev> cool
[03:34:15] <djam90> similar
[03:34:24] <djam90> $http.post(url, data, callback)
[03:34:42] <djam90> it works on promises so you return a promise and then do stuff then
[03:35:25] <Xatenev> ah okey^^
[03:35:29] <Xatenev> sounds cool
[03:35:29] <djam90> I think it is worth trying Angular
[03:35:31] <djam90> see if you like it
[03:35:33] <Xatenev> Yea :P
[03:35:39] <djam90> I had a little session with Ember and hated it
[03:36:05] <djam90> I am a PHP developer though I should not be learning this stuff :( I enjoy it but it just means I have less time for other things. But our front end developer refuses to learn anything
[03:36:26] <djam90> won't even do jQuery. says he has no time and too busy doing his pretty graphics
[03:37:37] <Xatenev> xD
[03:37:46] <Xatenev> I think that shouldb e splitted tho
[03:37:53] <Xatenev> Graphic guys should make the graphics :P
[03:38:11] <Xatenev> And the frontend guy just should do his best to create the layout inside the website :p
[03:38:20] <Xatenev> (Or maybe make it even better?)^^
[03:38:47] <djam90> well i say graphics he does the banners on the website AND the website design so he should be learning jQuery
[03:38:52] <sacho_> djam90, jquery's $ajax functions also return promises.
[03:39:05] <djam90> ah cool
[03:39:34] <Xatenev> Honestly we got a frontend developer here whos just slow :D
[03:39:46] <Xatenev> U tell him simple things, and he needs like 1 minute to understand what u just said to him lol #nooffense
[03:39:49] <Xatenev> :P
[03:40:14] <Xatenev> Tho I think i will take a look on angular these days^^
[04:11:10] <caraconan> Hi there. I need to re-factor this code: http://paste.debian.net/129544/ Basically I need to do 2 nested async db calls. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks
[04:16:21] <Xatenev> then do it.
[04:16:22] <Xatenev> ^^
[04:32:05] <Xatenev> Small question:
[04:32:11] <Xatenev> I have a list of checkboxes
[04:32:29] <Xatenev> Now i wanna check if none of those checkboxes is checked
[04:32:34] <Xatenev> How can I do that in the most simple way?.|
[04:32:43] <Xatenev> Help would be very cool!=)
[04:32:59] <xec> $(":checked").length
[04:33:00] <xec> i think
[04:33:33] <Xatenev> Oh
[04:33:34] <xec> or rather, myCheckboxCollection.filter(":checked").length
[04:33:38] <Xatenev> That would give me 7
[04:33:42] <Xatenev> if 7 checkboxes are checked for example?
[04:33:45] <xec> right
[04:33:52] <Xatenev> Thats very cool! I will try it out
[04:37:40] <Xatenev> works great!:) thanks a lot
[04:37:46] <Xatenev> didnt know it was so easy haha^^
[04:38:28] <caraconan> Does JQuery waits until a async method finish before transition to next event? For instance pagebeforeshow -> pageshow ?
[04:40:34] <hactor> Does jQuery have something for "produce a unique HTML id for an element"?
[04:40:42] <Cork> caraconan: they wait for the code to exit if that is what you mean
[04:40:56] <Cork> caraconan: js is single threaded so two callbacks can't run at the same time
[04:41:01] <xec> caraconan: yes. unless you're talking about async code inside the event handler
[04:41:41] <caraconan> xec: this is what I was talking about. Let me do some pseudocode
[04:42:05] <caraconan> Well, anyway it will not fix my problem
[04:42:20] <caraconan> Stuck with this: http://paste.debian.net/129544/
[04:42:23] <xec> hactor: not that I know of
[04:43:11] <Xatenev> wheey my super awesome filter is done
[04:43:11] <Xatenev> :D
[04:43:13] <Xatenev> party hard
[04:43:44] <Cork> hactor: yes it does
[04:43:55] <Cork> its called expandos
[04:45:01] <Cork> hactor: elm[$.expando]
[04:45:02] <duce1nik>  Hello everyone. What is the best way to refresh a page?  I'm using location.reload();  I place location.reload(); after a function  the problem is that it would reload before the iteration is complete here are the code.  http://jsfiddle.net/8kj62033/1/
[04:45:38] <Cork> hmm just realized you might have meant <elm id=""> by id :x
[04:45:48] <Woet> duce1nik: so run it after the iteration is complete.
[04:47:12] <Xatenev> is there an alternative to onChange?
[04:47:15] <duce1nik> Woet how do to do that?  for example this is what I'm using   function(){  callthisFunction();  location.reload(); }
[04:47:58] <Woet> duce1nik: you are doing asynchronous requests in those functions.
[04:47:58] <Xatenev> Nvm works great now :D
[04:48:12] <Xatenev> I invoked my functions in the wrong order
[04:48:42] <Woet> duce1nik: so keep track of how many requests you're doing and only reload once they're all done.
[04:50:57] <duce1nik> Woet  I track in debug. and it would go thru every iteration.  but when  not in debug it only run the complete the first one then reload
[04:51:20] <Woet> duce1nik: because, again, you are doing asynchronous requests.
[04:51:48] <duce1nik> Woet so how would I change it?
[04:51:58] <Woet> duce1nik: I already told you.
[04:52:46] <duce1nik> woet    how should I call it?
[04:52:53] <Woet> duce1nik: ?
[04:53:20] <duce1nik> Woet please be more specific.   function(){  callthisFunction();  location.reload(); }   is not working
[04:53:32] <duce1nik> how else would i call it?
[04:53:32] <Woet> duce1nik: third time, you are doing asynchronous requests.
[04:53:38] <Woet> duce1nik: so keep track of how many requests you're doing and only reload once they're all done.
[04:54:27] <duce1nik> N/m  I got it. Thanks
[04:59:17] <doug64k> duce1nik: there is an easy way to wait for several requests to complete
[05:00:11] <duce1nik> doug64k  please share.
[05:00:32] <doug64k> each request returns a promise, use $.when.apply($, <array of return values from ajax requests>)
[05:00:44] <doug64k> .done(function() { .. all done ..} )
[05:01:43] <doug64k> duce1nik: do you have a fiddle to look at?
[05:04:17] <duce1nik> doug64k http://jsfiddle.net/8kj62033/1/
[05:05:35] <Nye> Hello, I have a question and I am not sure if I am at the right place to ask it. I have a website that has links that are not clickable in mobile browser (except for android browser where it weirdly works). It works on desktop and there is a tiny small spot where you can actually touch click the link. Google search doesn't yield good results as I am not sure how to correctly search for this issue. Any help would be appreciated.
[05:06:15] <doug64k> duce1nik: little example http://www.jstraight.com/1139/1
[05:08:23] <duce1nik> doug64k
[05:08:24] <duce1nik> Thanx
[05:10:23] <Libin> hey guys.. I am trying to use a jquery lazy loading plugin for image table.. I have got the plugin to work.. but it loads only the images that are fit on screen. for example if there are 4 rows of images that fit in the screen.. those images will load but not the rest. any clue
[05:24:01] <doug64k> duce1nik: does db.transaction return a promise? if not you can create one for each request with var defer = $.Deferred(). then in the db.transaction callback, defer.resolve(whateverData) on success and defer.reject(errdata) on error, then use an array of those deferreds.
[05:24:22] <doug64k> as shown in my example call to when
[05:24:54] <djam90> Cork, you wrote this for me.. var current = lis.filter('.selected, :last');
[05:25:10] <djam90> I get it filters .selected, why :last
[05:25:28] <doug64k> I doubt that comma is supposed to be there
[05:25:41] <doug64k> .selected:last makes sense
[05:25:46] <djam90> doug64k, http://jsfiddle.net/seze4Lhj/3/
[05:26:18] <doug64k> djam90: don't use keyup for interactive changes. use .on('input'
[05:26:58] <djam90> my actual code uses: $(input).keyup( $.debounce( 250, ajaxSearch ));
[05:27:01] <djam90> should I change that
[05:27:07] <djam90> to .on('input;)
[05:27:11] <djam90> ;*
[05:27:15] <djam90> '*
[05:27:16] <djam90> sorry
[05:31:57] <doug64k> djam90: you should use keydown for the cursor key events and input for interactive textbox changes
[05:32:11] <doug64k> hold cursor down key - nohing happens until you release it
[05:33:55] <doug64k> djam90: it uses :last so it will get something if nothing is selected
[05:34:12] <doug64k> djam90: if you press arrow down from :last, it starts at the top.
[05:34:26] <doug64k> exactly what you want
[05:34:49] <doug64k> that filter means, .selected OR the last one
[05:34:55] <doug64k> so you get 1 or 2
[05:38:17] <doug64k> djam90 $(input).keyup( $.debounce( 250, ajaxSearch ));  should be $('input').on('input', $.debounce( 250, ajaxSearch ));
[05:38:36] <doug64k> I assume the missing ' in your selector was a mistake
[05:39:46] <doug64k> keyup wouldn't fire if they right-click-paste in there.
[05:43:35] <ButterBiscuit> Hey guys I'm just slightly pondering something. How do you force slideToggle to go bottom to top when the element in question is in a absolutely positioned parent with a top value. Bottom:0; doesn't seem to be doing the trick.
[05:43:56] <verumequals> beats me
[05:44:51] <Cork> ButterBiscuit: you can't
[05:45:04] <Cork> ButterBiscuit: remove the top value and it would work
[05:45:55] <ButterBiscuit> cork: Alright that's a bummer.
[05:46:12] <Cork> ButterBiscuit: slideToggle animates by changing the elements height
[05:46:21] <Cork> and as x, y is from top left
[05:46:33] <Cork> that means it will animate from top down unless you change the top value
[05:48:28] <smee> Is it possible to create an object within an object dynamically?
[05:48:44] <Cork> sure
[05:48:55] <Cork> { obj1: {} }
[05:48:59] <Cork> or what do you mean?
[05:49:52] <smee> Using cars as an example...  ultimately, I would like to be able to access the following: objectName.Toyota.doornumber & objectName.Toyota.wheelnumber etc.etc.
[05:50:13] <smee> but I want to enter that information dynamically
[05:50:14] <smee> something like
[05:50:19] <Cork> ok, and in what situation do you create this?
[05:50:33] <smee> objectName[carName][attribute] = x
[05:50:40] <Cork> sure
[05:50:47] <Cork> you have to create the object for each level though
[05:51:05] <smee> OK, I can do that first?
[05:51:11] <smee> I have created objectName
[05:51:25] <smee> can I then create an object called Toyota within objectName dynamically?
[05:51:27] <Cork> objectName[carName] = objectName[carName] || {}; objectName[carName][attribute] = value
[05:51:42] <smee> What do the pipes mean?
[05:52:27] <thyphus> set objectName[carName] to {} (empty hash) if not set
[05:52:29] <doug64k> smee: it means logical or... but js has a special behavior vs some other languages. that kind of expression returns the last value evaluated
[05:52:43] <smee> OK, thank you
[05:52:48] <smee> so if carName = toyota
[05:52:55] <doug64k> smee: if I do a || b    and a is falsy, then the result will be b. if a is truthy, the result will be a
[05:52:56] <smee> that would then create objectName.toyota
[05:53:08] <thyphus> no smee. that's wrong
[05:53:29] <thyphus> if the array key objectName[carName] is present it will set it to the value
[05:53:33] <thyphus> if not, it is empty
[05:53:44] <thyphus> (imho)
[05:54:04] <smee> So has that then created the array?
[05:54:15] <Cork> objectName[carName] = objectName[carName] || {}; means if(objectName[carName]) { objectName[carName] = objectName[carName] } else { objectName[carName] = {}; }
[05:54:28] <thyphus> smee: sorry, read the wrong line. i was on the line from Cork
[05:54:29] <Cork> it creates an object
[05:54:42] <thyphus> *blush*.. nevermind
[05:54:45] <thyphus> /clear
[05:55:05] <smee> OK, let me test it. Thank you for your help!!
[05:58:49] <doug64k> combining diacritics don't work eh? http://jsfiddle.net/nztw6d9c/
[05:58:51] <smee> Hello Cork, what have I done wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/0nt3mu43/
[06:01:55] <smee> @thyphus - this is what I am trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/0nt3mu43/
[06:03:16] <Cork> smee: http://jsfiddle.net/0nt3mu43/1/
[06:03:45] <Cork> you might have intended to not use 4 as key for the second and third value
[06:03:47] <smee> @Cork - you complete legend, thank you so much.
[06:04:05] <smee> What do you mean 2nd and 3rd value?
[06:04:45] <Cork> smee: is this what you meant to do? http://jsfiddle.net/0nt3mu43/2/
[06:08:04] <smee> @Cork - I'm not sure I can see the difference between those two!
[06:08:37] <smee> both of them you are able to get the result using objectname.carname.attribute
[06:09:27] <smee> or one is using objectname.carname[attribute]
[06:09:39] <smee> I'm not sure what the difference is though?
[06:10:14] <hxm> are those emoji keyboards in mobiles usable from javascript in a desktop computer?
[06:11:02] <smee> Ah, I see, so one is using the doornumber as a key
[06:11:26] <smee> and the other is using 4 as the key
[06:11:36] <smee> got ya
[06:13:47] <Cork> yes
[06:13:54] <Cork> (sorry for the delay got busy)
[06:14:57] <smee> @Cork - very helpful, thank you. One related question. If one of the values is "this is value", how would I be able to remove the spaces between them?
[06:15:15] <Cork> .replace(' ', '')
[06:15:20] <smee> as $.trim(objectName.carName.attribute); doesn't seem to work for me
[06:15:29] <Cork> ah
[06:15:31] <smee> OK, thanks!!
[06:15:39] <Cork> ya you can't use variables with dot notation
[06:15:42] <Cork> you need to use []
[06:16:00] <Cork> so objectName.carName.attribute becomes objectName[carName].attribute
[06:16:29] <smee> so $.trim(objectName[carNamedoornum]);
[06:16:30] <Cork> and $.trim only removes leading and trailing space
[06:16:33] <Cork> not inbetween
[06:16:37] <smee> Woops
[06:16:38] <smee> OK
[06:16:49] <Cork> objectName[carName].doornum
[06:16:53] <smee> I pressed enter by accident there. I'll use replace, thanks.
[06:21:02] <doug64k> now that's odd, when I use combining diacritics, I get the correct behavior in the code editor, but incorrect browser output http://jsfiddle.net/nztw6d9c/3/
[06:21:24] <anli> Does ckeditor kill trailing s:es under certain circumstances? Hofors becomes Hofor when in an end of a sentense
[06:21:26] <anli> sentence
[06:24:02] <doug64k> anli: seems unlikely. why in the world would it do that?
[06:24:10] <anli> true
[06:24:25] <anli> But that logic sooner or later is unusable :)
[06:24:31] <anli> becomes
[06:25:02] <anli> Or maybe not
[06:25:09] <anli> Can it be spellchecking?
[06:27:06] <doug64k> 3wire. die, just die. their routers are so slow they must do it on purpose
[06:27:06] <anli> Ok, seems like I do not even have to save, switching to source removes a trailing s for me
[06:27:12] <anli> "parkeringshus" becomes "parkeringshu"
[06:28:39] <nerder> hello
[06:29:09] <nerder> anybody could explain me how to use toggle to show and hide a div from the left?
[06:29:50] <doug64k> anli: it's not just you https://www.google.ca/search?q=characters+disappearing+ckeditor&oq=characters+disappearing+ckeditor&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l4j69i61.4532j0j4&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=93&ie=UTF-8
[06:30:09] <nerder> i did that, but i dnt want the it go inside the corner
[06:30:10] <nerder> http://jsfiddle.net/LU8En/533/
[06:30:26] <nerder> but i want something like this one
[06:30:54] <nerder> http://api.jqueryui.com/slide-effect/
[06:31:04] <nerder> even if the code looks completely the same to me
[06:31:08] <doug64k> nerder: you need to load jquery ui http://jsfiddle.net/LU8En/534/
[06:31:40] <nerder> doug64k: thank you!
[06:31:41] <doug64k> hey wait, you don't actually. just for ease
[06:31:59] <doug64k> nerder: that already worked
[06:32:09] <decx> ui is mandatory for toggle arguments
[06:32:16] <doug64k> ah, ok
[06:32:21] <doug64k> so it did need it. thanks
[06:32:31] <nerder> doug64k: i can add UI with bower?
[06:32:47] <anli> Wonder why it only are trailing s:es that dissapear, I do not even know how to google on that
[06:32:56] <doug64k> nerder: yes
[06:33:08] <doug64k> jquery ui
[06:33:21] <nerder> bower install jquery dsnt install ui too?
[06:33:25] <smee> @Cork - I think I've done something wrong, as the code is now not working: http://jsfiddle.net/0nt3mu43/4/
[06:33:57] <doug64k> nerder: bower install jquery-ui
[06:34:03] <doug64k> --save ?
[06:34:21] <anli> The incoming html seems ok (the one that ckeditor loads)
[06:34:40] <Cork> smee: http://jsfiddle.net/0nt3mu43/5/
[06:34:54] <Cork> smee: .doornum === ['doornum']
[06:34:58] <decx> trailing ]
[06:35:01] <decx> instead of )
[06:35:05] <Cork> might make it a bit clearer how they relate
[06:35:11] <Cork> ah, ya that too
[06:35:22] <smee> I think I overwrote your changes Cork.. :\
[06:35:37] <smee> (on jsfiddle)
[06:35:46] <Cork> jsfiddle doesn't overwrite
[06:35:50] <Cork> you get revisions
[06:35:56] <Cork> anyway the complete fix http://jsfiddle.net/0nt3mu43/6/
[06:36:29] <smee> Ah, so it's because doornum was not in ''
[06:36:38] <Cork> yes
[06:39:53] <doug64k> anli: what happens if you enter testeseseseseseseseses    does it trim to test ?
[06:40:07] <anli> heh, dunno
[06:40:43] <smee_> @Cork Not sure what happened there. Not sure you got my last message. If I was using carNames as an array, would I need to save them as carNames = [ "'BMW'", "'Ford'" ] so that they have '' around them?
[06:41:09] <Cork> no
[06:41:24] <Cork> if carNames is an array you would have to loop it
[06:41:54] <Cork> $.each(carNames, function(carName) { o[carName] = {}; })
[06:45:15] <doug64k> anli: says setting the character encoding of the page fixes it http://ckeditor.com/forums/Support/French-Characters-disappearing
[06:45:30] <doug64k> anli: what character encoding are you using?
[06:48:01] <anli> I have found the pattern, if I have a div with class col-xs-4 and uses "show blocks" and have a word with an ending s, in it, that s will be cut if source mode is entered
[06:48:38] <Cork> anli: wrong channel
[06:48:47] <Cork> take that in the ckeditor channel
[06:48:53] <anli> Yes, I should definitively ask in #ckeditor instead
[06:48:57] <anli> Sorry
[06:49:06] <Cork> no prob
[06:49:20] <Cork> its just you have much grater chance of actually getting help if you do :)
[06:49:23] <anli> I entered that channel, so now it has one participant ;)
[06:49:33] <Cork> O_o
[06:49:34] <anli> That would be disturbing
[06:49:36] <Cork> seriously?
[06:49:38] <anli> yes
[06:49:39] <anli> :)
[06:49:43] <anli> Maybe another irc network then
[06:49:59] <anli> Or there is no channel
[06:50:25] <nerder> there is a way to let the button follow the div that slide out? http://jsfiddle.net/LU8En/535/
[06:50:26] <Cork> ugg
[06:50:29] <anli> :)
[06:50:31] <Cork> that channel used to exist...
[06:50:34] <Cork> and be fairly lively too
[06:50:36] <anli> We can start it, lol
[06:50:46] <Cork> i don't use ckeditor anymore
[06:50:49] <decx> try #fckeditor
[06:50:53] <anli> Did try that
[06:50:56] <Cork> (of fckeditor as ...)
[06:51:13] <anli> I am alone in that channel as well
[06:51:38] <Cork> looks like they have moved to forums
[06:51:42] <Cork> http://ckeditor.com/forums
[06:51:52] <anli> Too bad, judging from how fast someone responds in those
[06:51:58] <Cork> ya
[06:52:02] <anli> Maybe stack overflow is the way to go
[06:52:06] <Cork> i'm not a fan of forums either
[06:52:14] <Cork> ugg i hate so
[06:52:24] <doug64k> if IRC wasn't 5000 year old technology, you might see every dev team using it all the time :D
[06:52:32] <anli> forums on that other hand is a lot better than mailing lists, which I think should be illegal
[06:52:35] <Uhkis> Cork: what? what's wrong with stack overflow?
[06:52:52] <Phil-Work> I usually find that if you're at the point of having to ask the question, it's unlikely you'll get a response
[06:52:57] <Uhkis> doug64k: hey, irc is hardly older than me!
[06:52:57] <Cork> Uhkis: you mean except all the faulty answers?
[06:53:16] <Cork> it goes about 10 bad answers to every good one in there
[06:53:19] <anli> Sometimes, you wish for faulty answers, asking on the kendo forum is like that
[06:53:28] <Uhkis> Cork: well, that.
[06:53:31] <anli> It is silence made digital
[06:53:35] <doug64k> bring back BBS's - I want to download everything on one site and upload it all to another one
[06:53:48] <Cork> heh
[06:55:52] <doug64k> so much smug and pretentious attitude on SO. gets irritating
[06:58:23] <nerder> how can a let the button follow the slide out div in this example?
[06:58:39] <nerder> http://jsfiddle.net/LU8En/535/
[06:58:41] <doug64k> nerder: make it a child of the thing that is sliding
[06:59:13] <nerder> so it have to be inside of it self?
[06:59:24] <nerder> if i put my button inside it slide out to
[06:59:27] <nerder> *too
[06:59:37] <nerder> and i have no way to clickit back
[06:59:51] <doug64k> yes
[07:00:39] <nerder> could u show me an example of "make it a child"
[07:00:54] <nerder> is a jquery stuff or css?
[07:01:16] <doug64k> nerder: http://jsfiddle.net/LU8En/537/
[07:01:22] <decx> there http://jsfiddle.net/LU8En/538/
[07:01:24] <doug64k> but as expected, it disappears along with its parent
[07:01:52] <Uhkis> most revisions i've ever seen on a fiddle
[07:02:08] <nerder> doug64k: and at the end the button disappear anyway
[07:06:36] <doug64k> nerder: http://jsfiddle.net/LU8En/542/
[07:07:14] <decx> i'd stick with mine :p
[07:07:40] <Uhkis> yeah, decx's solution seemed simpler
[07:07:59] <doug64k> it's the same solution - didnt see it while editing my fiddle
[07:08:45] <codecutter> <codecutter> why is the 'focus' event (line 14) not working? http://pastebin.com/2shHetAQ
[07:08:46] <codecutter>  <codecutter> notice i am appending the textarea field in foo function
[07:11:20] <smee_> @Cork - How would I be able to check if objectNames.CarNames.attribute does not exist? Can I just use if (objectNames.CarNames.attribute == null) {};
[07:11:37] <Cork> sure
[07:11:48] <Cork> or just if(!objectNames...)
[07:11:58] <Cork> also you want undefined not null
[07:12:26] <smee_> So if (!objectName.carName.attribute) {}
[07:12:45] <Cork> yes
[07:13:00] <smee_> Thanks :)
[07:13:05] <Cork> (except the dot and variable names again)
[07:21:20] <smee_> Is converting epochtime to human readable time fairly straight forward?
[07:25:42] <djam90> Cork I had to disappear. What did var current = lis.filter('.selected, :last'); mean?
[07:25:46] <djam90> why the , :last
[07:26:09] <Cork> djam90: if nothing is selected select the last one
[07:26:30] <Cork> its to make the .eq() code happy
[07:26:32] <djam90> so its like filter( class , default if none ) ?
[07:26:45] <Cork> no it is a normal css selector
[07:26:54] <Cork> div, span {}
[07:27:06] <djam90> ah I get it
[07:36:23] <djam90> Cork, that code works in my project, however, it is a little slow
[07:36:46] <Cork> djam90: cache the lists
[07:36:56] <djam90> although that might be because I am using debounce! lol
[07:36:56] <Cork> no need to create the list on each keypress
[07:37:19] <djam90> how would I cache it
[07:37:41] <Cork> make the variable exist cross event
[07:37:52] <Cork> meaning move the declaration to a shared scope
[07:38:28] <djam90> ah done
[07:41:29] <ccmonster> anyone here used jquery/isotope v2?
[07:44:18] <djam90> Cork I'd never used .index() before but it seems so useful
[07:44:26] <Cork> it is
[07:47:52] <doug64k> is there some reason that plugins mostly use $.extend for default options, instead of having an object with a prototype and the prototype contains the defaults?
[07:48:17] <NoiseEee> so people can pass in their own options easier?
[07:48:26] <Cork> doug64k: how would you extend an option object with prototype??
[07:49:37] <doug64k> i.e. instanceOptions = $.extend({}, default, options)   ->  instanceOptions = $.extend(Object.create(defaultOptions), options)
[07:50:11] <Cork> ah
[07:50:34] <Cork> doug64k: less characters mostly
[07:51:19] <doug64k> my way saves a bit of memory I guess - assuming there are a lot of separate options objects
[07:51:28] <NoiseEee> doug64k: part of the purpose of jquery is to keep it easy for those not well versed in JS to get things done; I wouldn't expect many to be using Object.create in anything
[07:51:46] <NoiseEee> also, cross-browser/cross-version stuff
[07:54:52] * doug64k nods in agreement
[08:03:39] <doug64k> doing my prototype trick enables a neat capability - changing the defaults on everything while preserving the override of anyone's settings, by changing the underlying prototype
[08:07:37] <doug64k> it also creates a restriction of no nested objects, because they won't copy-on-write as we need when someone sets a property on a subobject
[08:14:03] <hactor> Cork, you still don't like TypeScript?
[08:24:12] <sgfgdf> hello, guys! i'm doing $('#my_container').load('/resource/to/load'); then i want to create a loading spinner inside this container. is it possible to get the container objet inside the ajaxStart event?
[08:27:05] <decx> just put your spinner in there before the load
[08:27:16] <decx> $().html(myspinner).load()
[08:27:46] <decx> or append whatever
[08:29:32] <doug64k> how uncool is it to transform $(this).method(foo)  ->   $.fn.method.call(this, foo)
[08:29:46] <doug64k> wait that wouldn't work
[08:29:47] <sgfgdf> decx, my idea was to append it to the concrete container with the ajaxStart event and remove it with ajaxStop. the idea is to sue separate spinners showing only in the boxes that are loading not put some spinner in the whole page.
[08:29:50] <doug64k> nevermind lmao
[08:30:16] <decx> well load juts replaces all the content anyway so feel free to append a loader div to your old container
[08:31:03] <sgfgdf> decx, i don't know how to access the container in the ajaxStart event.
[08:31:29] <decx> you use load
[08:31:45] <decx> append before load, done
[08:33:27] <doug64k> can someone code review this jquery plugin boilerplate I am working on? http://www.jstraight.com/1138/9
[08:34:04] <ccmonster> i cant seem to get isotope v2 to work with jquery. anyone got any suggestions?
[08:35:00] <sgfgdf> decx, can i overwrite the load() method to do that stuff before loading? because i don't want to change the current $('container').load('path'); statements.
[08:35:30] <decx> why?
[08:35:43] <ccmonster> https://gist.github.com/brjadams/8f61fc28a409c5d455a2
[08:35:59] <ccmonster> I can't seem to get the isotope to work with jquery selectors. Anyone done this berfore?
[08:37:55] <doug64k> sgfgdf: technically, yes
[08:38:13] <doug64k> not advisable for production stuff. for debugging it's a great trick
[08:38:41] <doug64k> however, you could make a legitimate plugin that makes a load that does what you want
[08:38:56] <doug64k> in a few lines of code
[08:39:00] <sgfgdf> decx, well i don't know what is the best practice in this situation, but this seems to me to involve less changes and protect me from missing to change some of the other load() statements.
[08:39:23] <doug64k> sgfgdf: I'll show an example
[08:39:36] <decx> dont facilitate this doug :(
[08:39:54] <robertmaxrees> what's going on now?
[08:40:28] <sgfgdf> decx, what is better? to create some specific function to do it and then inside call ajax or?
[08:40:34] <decx> sgfgdf wants to change the load() method to add a spinner beforehand instead of just doing .append(spinner).load()
[08:41:52] <decx> i dont see any benefit in making a new function for this
[08:42:00] <robertmaxrees> sgfgdf is this for a personal project?
[08:42:03] <robertmaxrees> or are you apart of a team?
[08:42:21] <decx> tautology'd
[08:42:31] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[08:43:04] <robertmaxrees> but seriously, if this is something for your employer, don't do that.  it'll just wind up confusing the hell out of people.
[08:45:04] <doug64k> sgfgdf: http://www.jstraight.com/1141/2
[08:46:16] <decx> yuk
[08:46:34] <robertmaxrees> don't do that :(
[08:46:35] <doug64k> oops http://www.jstraight.com/1141/3
[08:46:42] <robertmaxrees> that's a really bad idea imo.
[08:47:14] <jop008> hi what is wrong with this line var input = $('<input type="text">').attr({id: this.fieldname + "_field", placeholder: this.placeholder,
[08:47:14] <jop008> 518      class: "ui-input-text ui-body-c ui-autocomplete-input selinput", autocomplete: "on"});
[08:47:20] <doug64k> hooking is possible and that is how. whether that is cool or not is another thing
[08:47:30] <jop008> the error is invalid property id
[08:47:41] <jop008> on line 518
[08:48:11] <decx> class is an illegal key without the quotes
[08:48:26] <decx> no idea if that's the bug here but it's a problem in ie
[08:48:38] <robertmaxrees> jop008 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bt3fhh3o/
[08:48:41] <robertmaxrees> parses fine
[08:48:48] <robertmaxrees> even without the quotes it parsed fine.
[08:49:07] <decx> ie will throw an error
[08:49:15] <robertmaxrees> ah yeah good point.
[08:49:46] <sgfgdf> okay, guys! thanks for the help! will try to make a separate function for loading ajax with a spinner.
[08:49:51] <jop008> thanks rob
[08:49:57] <robertmaxrees> sgfgdf ++
[08:50:10] <jop008> but all compressors fail on this line yuicompress
[08:50:14] <jop008> for example
[08:50:18] <robertmaxrees> we have beforesend a done for those reasons, sgfgdf
[08:50:36] <jop008> I want to minimize my files in batch
[08:51:17] <robertmaxrees> it shouldn't.
[08:51:26] <robertmaxrees> you added the quotes and tried again, right?
[08:52:00] <robertmaxrees> also: .prop() instead of .attr(), etc.
[09:02:44] <robertmaxrees> jop008 if you have questions put 'em out to the channel.  folks will be happy to help :)
[09:03:28] <doug64k> the first thing I said was don't use it for production, only use it for debugging - then I gave an ample supply of rope
[09:03:37] <doug64k> decx: ^
[09:03:56] <lenswipe> hey guys
[09:04:08] <lenswipe> wonder if someone could point me in the way of a good passowrd strength lib
[09:04:28] <hxm> guys i have this http://jsfiddle.net/jj26v78w/ but id is empty
[09:04:32] <lenswipe> I found this one: http://asgaard.co.uk/misc/jquery/?show=password but it's not been updated since 2011 and it's a little agressive for my liking
[09:04:38] <lenswipe> hxm, lets see
[09:04:57] <lenswipe> hxm try $(this).id ?
[09:05:13] <hxm> yes i also tried that, and attr("id")
[09:05:15] <hxm> returns undefined
[09:05:16] <robertmaxrees> hxm becuase "action" is the parent div.
[09:05:21] <robertmaxrees> not the thing you clicked.
[09:05:27] <hxm> ah oh is truth
[09:05:32] <hxm> how to delegate?
[09:05:40] <robertmaxrees> $(".action").on('click', 'button', function() {
[09:05:46] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jj26v78w/1/
[09:06:14] <hxm> aah works perfectly
[09:06:18] <hxm> thank you +1
[09:06:31] <robertmaxrees> also use console.log() instead of alert for debugging/.
[09:06:40] <doug64k> lenswipe: I doubt it is aggressive. most people who think their p@ssw0rd is g00d really have a t3rr1bl3 password
[09:06:48] <damasceno> Hello everyone. I'm using jquery portfolio plugin with the following code: http://pastebin.com/YaXR8wXz, is there a way to show only X pictures and if the user clicks on the picture show everything? Because it shows 1.000 photos and it freezes the browser. Thanks.
[09:07:08] <hxm> right
[09:07:38] <lenswipe> doug64k, well anyway, it's too long for our requirements (not my desicion, I'm just the junior underdog here :) )
[09:07:57] <lenswipe> hxm, http://jsfiddle.net/jj26v78w/2/
[09:09:06] <robertmaxrees> lenswipe btw use .prop(), not .attr()
[09:09:14] <lenswipe> ok
[09:09:54] <stickyelement> hello
[09:09:55] <robertmaxrees> damasceno most of us aren't going to be familiar with those particular plugins, so it's hard to help.
[09:10:03] <lenswipe> wonder if someone could point me in the way of a good passowrd strength lib?
[09:10:23] <robertmaxrees> lenswipe do you have a backend enforcement for password strength?
[09:10:29] <lenswipe> robertmaxrees, no
[09:10:31] <damasceno> :(
[09:10:47] <robertmaxrees> then enforcing it via js isn't going to be a great idea imo.
[09:10:55] <lenswipe> robertmaxrees, i am aware.
[09:11:03] <lenswipe> however - I'm just the junior dev tasked with this
[09:11:06] <robertmaxrees> do a backend service and expose it so you can check via ajax.
[09:11:14] <robertmaxrees> giving you ideas to ask about real quick ;)
[09:11:31] <lenswipe> well for the moment they just want this fixed
[09:12:19] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[09:12:27] <lenswipe> ...yeah.
[09:14:08] <stickyelement> when my cat hits the ceiling, the div.sticky-wrapper gets a height, which causes the lorem content to spasm (jump). http://codepen.io/TLausZ/pen/hBvED
[09:14:26] <decx> the solution is to not throw your pets
[09:14:31] <damasceno> robertmaxrees: but it's quite simple to understand it, I create an album (<li class='act'><a href='#' class='filter' data-filter='*'>Todos</a></li>";) it will filter the pictures. I just need specify how many pictures I want to show, get it? :/
[09:15:07] <stickyelement> It says so in the docs:http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/shortcuts/sticky-elements/ "Sets that wrapper’s height."
[09:15:18] <stickyelement> Me don't want that.....
[09:15:22] <robertmaxrees> damasceno i understand what you want to do, but i don't know the libraries and stuff you're using.
[09:16:03] <stickyelement> I'm a cat lover by the way... hard to believe ;-)
[09:17:27] <doug64k> stickyelement: I see transition stuff but I dont see it specifying what to transition anywhere
[09:17:48] <doug64k> as in, which properties
[09:18:26] <respek> doug64k: "most people who think their p@ssw0rd is g00d really have a t3rr1bl3 password" - classic
[09:18:57] <decx> hunter2 !
[09:19:03] <robertmaxrees> decx++
[09:22:11] <stickyelement> doug64k: sorry, I don't get it what your saying
[09:22:49] <pixelpr0> Hi. Maybe someone can help me. If got a PHP which returns an java array. I want my main-page to update the array every 10 seconds... How could i do that? thats the php: http://www.death-or-glory.de/map/_markers.php
[09:22:54] <stickyelement> it gets set in the sticky library, if I understood you correctly
[09:22:58] <robertmaxrees> pixelpr0 do what now?>
[09:23:03] <robertmaxrees> php is returning jaca?
[09:23:04] <robertmaxrees> *java
[09:23:07] <pixelpr0> i fixxed the problem :)
[09:23:17] <pixelpr0> it returns the java array
[09:23:19] <pixelpr0> elements*
[09:23:28] <robertmaxrees> return JSON instead of java.
[09:23:47] <pixelpr0> ok, so i can update it live?
[09:24:06] <robertmaxrees> pixelpr0 huh?  you can do a request every 10 seconds if you want.
[09:24:14] <stickyelement> you can set an php http header, reload every X second if I'm not mistaken, but thats for the PHP chanel
[09:24:15] <pixelpr0> ok
[09:24:24] <robertmaxrees> but you're returning data that your JS can't really understand.
[09:24:24] <pixelpr0> ill try that
[09:24:50] <pixelpr0> the problem isnt the php thing. Im just a noob with jQuery and want to update the javascript array every 10 seconds without reloading the page
[09:24:58] <robertmaxrees> pixelpr0 that's call ajax.
[09:25:00] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple stuff.
[09:25:14] <robertmaxrees> *called
[09:25:40] <pixelpr0> ok ill try :) thanks anyway
[09:26:05] <doug64k> stickyelement: you want that block thing to animate up and down with a transition? or what
[09:27:25] <stickyelement> doug64k: no, the cat should be stuck at the ceiling without the lorem content to flicker
[09:27:42] <stickyelement> and later it should scroll away again
[09:28:35] <stickyelement> as you can see, the .sticky-wrapper gets an height of 202px
[09:28:46] <doug64k> stickyelement: what does the cat have to do with it? the cat works fine for me. that big orange box getting huge and back t a sliver, that is a problem
[09:29:13] <stickyelement> because it says so in the library. Excatly that's what I dont want
[09:29:30] <doug64k> ah ok
[09:31:41] <robertmaxrees> wait then why are you using the library?
[09:31:46] <stickyelement> yes doug64k , the cat IS fine. No worries PETA ;-)
[09:32:12] <stickyelement> because I'm a noob and can't code that for myself.
[09:32:26] <stickyelement> I like to ovveride that
[09:32:46] <doug64k> what is that big tomato box for though?
[09:33:39] <robertmaxrees> let me phrase that differently: don't use the library - it obviously isn't giving you what you want.  can you explain what you're actually trying to accmplish?
[09:36:31] <doug64k> stickyelement: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ADziL
[09:37:18] <stickyelement> I want to recreate exactly that: http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2013/07/features/the-life-of-pi
[09:37:39] <pixelpr0> whats wrong here? http://www.death-or-glory.de/map/_markers.php
[09:37:45] <stickyelement> scroll, and you will see the sticky imgs on the right, until the next one.
[09:37:46] <pixelpr0> see source-code
[09:38:17] <robertmaxrees> pixelpr0 you can't multiline in JS strings like that.
[09:38:35] <pixelpr0> argh... im a fuckin noob in JS
[09:38:51] <stickyelement> doug64k: EXACTLY! What did you do?
[09:39:03] <pixelpr0> i need to do '+  NEW LINE ' asdasdasd '+
[09:39:05] <pixelpr0> true?
[09:39:06] <doug64k> stickyelement: made the sticky-element position absolute
[09:39:22] <robertmaxrees> pixelpr0 or just put them all on the same line.  OR remove the first and last quotes
[09:39:27] <doug64k> sticky-wrapper*
[09:39:30] <stickyelement> oh....
[09:39:42] <doug64k> stickyelement: it can't take up space if it is absolute
[09:39:49] <stickyelement> that simple? DAMN!
[09:40:03] <pixelpr0> removing the first and last quotes fixed it :)
[09:40:04] <pixelpr0> thanks
[09:40:17] <stickyelement> I should stop working, and get sleep....
[09:40:31] <doug64k> stickyelement: double check that you are loading all of the css that the plugin needs
[09:40:38] <doug64k> perhaps that is a non-issue
[09:42:21] <jsc802> hi
[09:42:57] <stickyelement> I don't think so, because the docs clearly states, that the wrapper gets the hight of the element set.
[09:43:51] <jsc802> can someone look at this page http://www.lunabazaar.com/popup-test.aspx
[09:44:02] <jsc802> i cant figure out why the go button works outside of the modal but not inside
[09:44:41] <robertmaxrees> probably because your modal code clones the node and uses a copy or something like that.
[09:45:21] <robertmaxrees> can you share the code that you're using for the binding?
[09:45:23] <stickyelement> your go button is not in an <form>
[09:46:06] <robertmaxrees> stickyelement the working one isn't either ;)
[09:46:19] <robertmaxrees> well, actually the entire page is in a form i gues.s
[09:46:21] <damasceno> robertmaxrees:
[09:46:31] <jsc802> unfortunately i dont have control over the actual sign up widget
[09:46:46] <jsc802> i think it must be a problem with the jquery modal plugin im using?
[09:46:51] <stickyelement> robertmaxrees: you are right! sorry
[09:46:56] <damasceno> robertmaxrees: I'm using isotype: http://isotope.metafizzy.co/
[09:47:19] <damasceno> I just need to filter it and show only the first 4 images, otherwise the site will continue slow. :S
[09:47:26] <bl4ckdu5t> $(window).load() listen to what events exactly?
[09:48:21] <jsc802> also: its not because there are two of them, it still doesnt work in the modal when i take out the second one
[09:48:25] <bl4ckdu5t> immediately window loads or while it loads
[09:49:04] <bl4ckdu5t> I see it used for some preloaders and it confuses me how it works only while the window is loading
[09:49:11] <bl4ckdu5t> I expect it to be on window load
[09:50:44] <robertmaxrees> bl4ckdu5t the "load" event on the window is when everything has finished loading.
[09:50:56] <decx> bit late but i played around with multiple images stickyelement and without waypoints.js http://jsfiddle.net/decx/br2L9n8j/
[09:50:57] <robertmaxrees> including external scripts/css/images
[09:51:24] <robertmaxrees> jsc802 try seeing if you can't append the modal to the main form of the page.
[09:53:17] <jsc802> oh good idea it looks like it gets appended to body
[09:54:20] <hxm> guys now i have this http://hastebin.com/yeqegucoqu.js, this sends an ajax requests which works and returns status 200, but i cant find the <li> parent of that <button> which is in a <div class="action">
[09:54:26] <Skapadapaduu> is there a site like jsfiddle for jquery validator? (it seems that there isn't validator support in jsfiddle)
[09:54:49] <decx> jslint will do just fine :p
[09:55:08] <robertmaxrees> Skapadapaduu you include it using the external resources option
[09:55:34] <decx> answers for both interpretations nice :>
[09:56:35] <bl4ckdu5t> robertmaxrees: that means people who include preloaders this way only delay users more
[09:56:47] <robertmaxrees> bl4ckdu5t what are you trying to accomplish?
[09:57:06] <bl4ckdu5t> A preloader that only displays before the page is loaded
[09:57:18] <robertmaxrees> then do it immediately, outside of everything else.
[09:57:21] <bl4ckdu5t> not something that displays shortly after it's loaded for swag
[09:57:42] <bl4ckdu5t> ok. then on load , I'll do other things\
[09:57:42] <robertmaxrees> set that to display on pageload, then hide it in the window load.
[09:57:53] <bl4ckdu5t> ok good
[09:58:12] <robertmaxrees> but avoid using a preloader in the first place tbh.
[09:58:15] <bl4ckdu5t> This makes a lot more sense
[09:58:22] <bl4ckdu5t> why?
[09:58:33] <robertmaxrees> there's a reason you don't see them very often.
[09:58:49] <decx> i saw them all the time
[09:58:52] <robertmaxrees> you lose a user's interest pretty quickly when you delay their ability to interact.
[09:58:54] <decx> in 1998
[09:58:57] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[09:59:03] <bl4ckdu5t> lol decx
[09:59:42] <stickyelement> lol
[10:00:20] <bl4ckdu5t> Do you think it's bad in a case like this http://www.cabletv.com/the-walking-dead
[10:00:40] <stickyelement> decx: Thats quite nice: http://jsfiddle.net/decx/br2L9n8j/ but not exactly what I want. I really want this: http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2013/07/features/the-life-of-pi
[10:00:47] <robertmaxrees> bl4ckdu5t that's a pretty specific use case.
[10:01:27] <bl4ckdu5t> of why it's not recommended
[10:01:41] <robertmaxrees> that's a special case when it might be appropriate.
[10:01:55] <robertmaxrees> but if you can setup a way to avoid it, do that.
[10:02:07] <bl4ckdu5t> ok. Good. Thanks a lot!
[10:03:37] <decx> i dont really care what exactly you want i was just curious about the basic implementation stickyelement ;)
[10:03:39] <Skapadapaduu> I have quite low level jquery validator question: http://jsfiddle.net/keb7ubsc/ How can check if both passwords are the same? Now it says "please enter the same value again", but I can't understand why
[10:04:50] <stickyelement> decx: yeah, it's great anyway, but there is a little flaw. all images, except the first need to scoll outside to stick = looks like jumping
[10:05:03] <robertmaxrees> Skapadapaduu http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/keb7ubsc/1/
[10:05:10] <robertmaxrees> it needs a selector, per http://jqueryvalidation.org/equalTo-method/
[10:06:00] <Skapadapaduu> oh, thanks
[10:06:14] <stickyelement> password handling in frontend? good luck with that.
[10:06:26] <stickyelement> SECURITY BREACH Whooopwhooopp!
[10:06:36] <robertmaxrees> stickyelement pretty common pattern to test two passwords against each other.
[10:06:41] <robertmaxrees> to have people verify.
[10:07:03] <robertmaxrees> Skapadapaduu you're also checking that in your backend, right?
[10:07:09] <Skapadapaduu> yes
[10:07:14] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[10:07:54] <stickyelement> just checking ;-) You don't believe what is out there.....
[10:08:11] <decx> Skapadapaduu i think i had to do equalTo: "#element" the last time
[10:08:12] <robertmaxrees> stickyelement what he's doing isn't inherently insecure or unsafe imo
[10:08:21] <stickyelement> I had a client with no login. = Hacked
[10:08:42] <stickyelement> His excuse: but nobody new the servers IP.....
[10:09:03] <stickyelement> security trough obscurity, works really well ;-)
[10:09:07] <robertmaxrees> err, okay?  why are you projecting that one experience on a random person in an irc channel?
[10:09:18] <decx> Skapadapaduu yes equalTo requires a selector
[10:09:25] <decx> ie [name=password]
[10:09:27] <stickyelement> robertmaxrees: yes, you are right of course
[10:09:33] <decx> or whatever class or id you want to add
[10:10:36] <decx> oh that was already answered
[10:10:39] <decx> shit ^^
[10:10:43] <stickyelement> sorry if (you thinkI I projecting. I did not want to.
[10:13:20] <stickyelement> OK guys, So long and thanks for all the help (fish).
[10:13:39] <jsc802> thank you robertmaxrees that worked
[10:13:43] <jsc802> :)
[10:13:47] <stickyelement> Hope I can help someday how you are helping us. ;-)
[10:27:05] <doug64k> remember when win95 shared all shared drives with the internet and you could port scan and get laughable huge lists of wide open read/write shares and printers
[10:27:32] <doug64k> ...those were the days
[10:35:41] <BillCriswell> doug64k: I love messing with people's printers.
[10:36:51] <BillCriswell> I print things like "I NEED MORE RED INK" in huge red letters and my upstairs neighbor / friend still hasn't realized it was me. Hopefully she isn't buying ink every time I do it.
[10:38:14] <lucenut> Hey guys. I am trying to use this jquery menu http://staff.washington.edu/tft/tests/menus/simplyaccessible/index.html
[10:38:56] <lucenut> I have it running on my localhost and it works fine but when I put it on a server it's not working.
[10:39:11] <lucenut> http://dev.luceconsulting.net/TMI/JQM/menu3.cfm
[10:39:44] <robertmaxrees> "it's not working" is really unhelpful - how?
[10:39:55] <doug64k> lol, yeah I considered making a program to map every printer and print "your computer is WIDE OPEN to the internet and anyone can read or write files. Don't believe it? Go look at your desktop background (and I would change their background).
[10:40:06] <doug64k> I was too chicken to do it to everyone though
[10:40:20] <lucenut> I can't tab through the menu.
[10:40:48] <BillCriswell> doug64k: Probably for the best haha.
[10:42:48] <robertmaxrees> lucenut 5 bucks says <link rel="stylesheet" href="../styles/main.css" type="text/css"/> has some stuff you need.
[10:47:55] <cjohnson> tabbing seems to work just fine for me with both examples
[10:49:29] <lucenut> There is no main.css in my page.
[10:49:47] <lucenut> What examples are you talking about cjohnson?
[10:49:56] <cjohnson> the two URLs you provided
[10:49:58] <cjohnson> I can tab through both
[10:50:05] <cjohnson> albeit clunkily (on both)
[10:50:34] <lucenut> When you tab to "My Events" is the menu expanding like it does when you mouse-over it?
[10:51:12] <lucenut> I've tried in FF, Chrome and IE.
[10:51:13] <robertmaxrees> lucenut right, there IS a main.css on the washington.edu site
[10:51:53] <lucenut> Yeah, when I run this exact file on my localhost (no main.css) I can tab through it all just like their examples.
[10:52:07] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[10:52:23] <robertmaxrees> oh i see the problem.
[10:52:49] <robertmaxrees> check out the network tab in your devtools ;)
[10:54:12] <lucenut> I'm looking at it. What's wrong?
[10:54:19] <Scriptonaut> https://gist.github.com/robins35/ac403356a7819cbd1c16
[10:54:35] <robertmaxrees> lucenut i'm getting a 401 on menu.js
[10:54:42] <Scriptonaut> hey guys, the json I'm getting is corrupt, people ine #javascript say it's because dataType: 'script'
[10:54:46] <Scriptonaut> what should I change it to?
[10:54:56] <cjohnson> as they said in ##javascript, json
[10:55:00] <cjohnson> if you are indeed getting JSON back
[10:55:13] <Scriptonaut> I changed it to json, same error
[10:55:29] <cjohnson> so dump your data var and see what you're actually passing it
[10:55:34] <robertmaxrees> then your returned data is invalid.
[10:55:38] <cjohnson> it's having trouble parsing your response, so dump the response
[10:56:00] <lucenut> What does that mean robertmaxrees?
[10:56:08] <robertmaxrees> lucenut that means it failed to get the JS
[10:56:33] <Scriptonaut> Object {lengthComputable: true, loaded: 1290, total: 1290, bitrate: 5972.222222222223}
[10:56:36] <Scriptonaut> that's my data object
[10:56:37] <robertmaxrees> 401 is "Unauthorized"
[10:56:57] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut so if you do JSON.stringify(data) , where "data" is the response, what do you get?
[10:57:09] <cjohnson> why are you trying to parse an object with JSON.parse?
[10:57:13] <cjohnson> it's already parsed
[10:57:52] <Scriptonaut> Gah, I'm just copying code from the photo upload that someone else on this project wrote a while ago and modifying it for csv
[10:57:56] <Scriptonaut> the file uploads fine
[10:58:01] <Scriptonaut> but I can't get progress info
[10:58:03] <cjohnson> copying without understanding, problem #1 :P
[10:58:07] <Scriptonaut> I know
[10:58:20] <cjohnson> so go through the code and read it and understand it, it seems like you haven't done that yet
[11:00:30] <kegster> decx, you around?
[11:00:49] <kegster> no question, just wanted to show you something
[11:00:53] <cjohnson> nudes
[11:01:33] <kegster> :D
[11:04:58] <lucenut> OK, I even put the whole path in http://dev.luceconsulting.net/TMI/JQM/menu.js and I still get 401.
[11:05:23] <robertmaxrees> lucenut right - that's an issue with your server.
[11:05:31] <robertmaxrees> it's not allowing you access to the file.
[11:05:35] <robertmaxrees> it's not that it can't find it.
[11:05:46] <cjohnson> check permissions?
[11:05:51] <cjohnson> oh wait iis
[11:06:13] <cjohnson> well I guess windows has permissions too :(
[11:06:15] <decx> well show up kegster
[11:06:16] <robertmaxrees> the error page tells you exactly what you need to do ;)
[11:06:35] <cjohnson> heh nice
[11:06:36] <lucenut> OK, thanks.
[11:06:49] <kegster> decx, i have a few more sprites to make but: http://se-oh.seoapt.com/machine/
[11:07:00] <kegster> im combinging the glow ball and that press together into 1 animation
[11:07:20] <kegster> and the droplet on right (droplet faucet and bowl/bucket or w/e) and the red wheel under the press
[11:07:22] <kegster> only 3 left :D
[11:07:25] <decx> nicely done
[11:07:36] <kegster> :D
[11:07:40] <kegster> heck ya that's what i like to hear :D
[11:07:43] <kegster> ty man
[11:07:49] <kegster> im glad i showed you my first implementation
[11:07:56] <lucenut> robertmaxrees is that a setting in IIS or windows permissions?
[11:07:57] <kegster> i had no idea where to start lmao
[11:08:12] <robertmaxrees> lucenut the error page guides you through the process....
[11:08:19] <kegster> also there are more animations to do aside from the 3 sprites i need to migrate from setInterval
[11:08:29] <kegster> when i get the 2 mai nsections done ill let u know
[11:11:05] <lucenut> Sorry for being a dummy, but I don't know what ACL is.
[11:12:07] <kegster> austin city limits :D
[11:12:07] <lucenut> I just went in the file security permissions and gave the IIS_IUSR full control.
[11:12:42] <robertmaxrees> errr, don't do that.
[11:13:26] <respek> Question: Am I crazy, or should this click even be working? http://jsfiddle.net/respek/j1u4ybqL/1/
[11:13:27] <lucenut> OK, I just changed it back to read & execute. :-)
[11:14:45] <respek> *in thinking that
[11:15:05] <robertmaxrees> respek mind clarifying?
[11:15:22] <robertmaxrees> if that width is less than 850, click something, then bind a listener to it?
[11:16:36] <respek> hmmm, when you put it that way, I should switch the bind and click, b/c the bind is just a test to see if the click is happening, which it doesn't appear to be.
[11:16:55] <robertmaxrees> the console log won't work if you don't bind first.
[11:17:00] <robertmaxrees> the code doesn't look ahead like that.
[11:17:10] <respek> right, of course, herp derp.
[11:17:29] <respek> well, I see that the click event is occuring, I'm just not getting the response I'm expecting
[11:19:01] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[11:21:03] <respek> I'm going to try to build a larger fiddle, b/c upon click the expected action doesn't occur. I'm stumped
[11:21:16] <robertmaxrees> build a functioning example.
[11:21:36] <respek> I'll do my best, it's a lot of code I didn't write, so there's shit everywhere.
[11:21:49] <robertmaxrees> just do the click event part.
[11:27:54] <respek> robertmaxrees: I can't figure out how to get it to appear correctly without pasting literally all of the  css and html from the area, I don't think that's a good idea for me to post
[11:28:06] <robertmaxrees> self-contained is all you need.
[11:28:10] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't need to "look" right.
[11:28:13] <lucenut> I can't figure out what the problem is with that js file ACL.
[11:28:59] <respek> ok, I'll try.
[11:29:03] <csd_> I'm having a lot of trouble doing destroy() with x-editable. Nor can I do removeClass() or remoteAttr('class'). I suspect there's some code that is immediately readding the class after I remove it manually. How can I debug this?
[11:31:09] <marykate> anyone here willing to help me with some assignment? I already have a code - chat room and now I have to add a list of active users.. i'm completely new to javascript and I don't have a clue what to do, any suggestions?
[11:31:24] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ marienz
[11:31:24] <b-ot> marienz: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:31:35] <robertmaxrees> woops wrong username
[11:31:40] <robertmaxrees> marykate just ask your questions
[11:34:57] <lucenut> If I paste the js from that menu.js into a script tag in my menu3.cfm it works (is tabbable). But logged in as an administrator I created a new menu3.js and still doesn't work.
[11:36:02] <robertmaxrees> lucenut right.
[11:37:04] <respek> robertmaxrees: idk how this could possibly be helpful... I'll try again later though, thanks for trying :/
[11:37:22] <robertmaxrees> respek err, a small example...
[11:37:32] <robertmaxrees> like, the barebones of what you need.
[11:38:32] <respek> ok, one moment, I'll try to clean it up
[11:39:53] <StanAccy> Ive got some Javascript that is calling:  jQuery( fn ); where fn is a function object.  What does this do, and why would one write such a call?
[11:40:12] <cjohnson> $(function) is an alias for $(document).ready(function) I believe
[11:40:12] <StanAccy> (rather than just invoking the function object directly)
[11:40:28] <cjohnson> so it delays execution of the function until the page has loaded if it hasn't yet when $() is run
[11:41:01] <robertmaxrees> it's binding to document ready.
[11:41:06] <StanAccy> I see, thanks.  This function call is being invoke within a domready function already so Im puzzled as to why the author did this
[11:41:07] <robertmaxrees> not load - that's a distinct event
[11:41:26] <robertmaxrees> could be a variety of reasons tbh.
[11:41:35] <cjohnson> it will run immediately if document is already ready
[11:41:41] <cjohnson> so all it does is guarantee the dom is ready when it runs
[11:41:51] <robertmaxrees> yep.  they really wanted to be sure it was ready.
[11:41:54] <StanAccy> cjohnson: Thanks.  But it seems to be queueing that call though
[11:41:57] <robertmaxrees> or the code morphed into that over the years.
[11:42:46] <StanAccy> I have two onDomReady functions, both functions execute in order defined in file.  However, the first function invokes jquery(someOtherFn); and that someOtherFn is being delayed until *after* the second onDomReady handler has executed
[11:43:02] <robertmaxrees> right, because it's a queue.
[11:43:07] <StanAccy> it seems to be queueing up the call and putting it at the back of the queue
[11:43:17] <robertmaxrees> sort of, yeah.
[11:43:28] <StanAccy> so what reasons could there be for the author to have done this (Im assuming the author isnt stupid and knew what they were doing)
[11:43:29] <robertmaxrees> it's an event queue
[11:43:43] <robertmaxrees> it may have morphed into that over the years so it wasn't intentional.
[11:43:56] <StanAccy> robertmaxrees: Ok, thats a good point.
[11:44:02] <robertmaxrees> or they wanted to make sure that code ran after everything else in dom ready
[11:44:33] <robertmaxrees> perhaps they were working around a bug.  could be tons of reasons.
[11:44:41] <robertmaxrees> given enough time, you'll see code like that more and more.
[11:46:53] <StanAccy> Thanks - that helps a lot
[11:47:52] <robertmaxrees> When In Doubt, Break Shit™
[11:50:43] <blinky_> Hi all, I am having a problem with this script.  The console log is showing the correct branch but the php is producing an error saying the $_GET['branchGet'] is undefined.  I presume that means the value is not being sent across and a var_dump of $_GET shows it is empty.  What am I doing wrong? - http://pastebin.com/ski1ygrZ
[11:51:21] <robertmaxrees> why are you sending along extra data in your GET request?
[11:51:45] <blinky_> not that I know of
[11:51:51] <robertmaxrees> data: {branchGet: branchGet},
[11:52:01] <clearcut> anybody used adsense? i have a question...
[11:52:13] <robertmaxrees> clearcut you can try asking but you may have mixed results.
[11:52:39] <robertmaxrees> blinky_ kill that data option and try again.
[11:53:18] <clearcut> adsense - if i have multiple pages with diff. domains can i link them all to same adsense account?
[11:54:06] <pampuchy> hello, is it possible to get values from a slider on a webpage and feed it to sass? i need it inside my sass, not plain css
[11:54:32] <blinky_> robertmaxrees: Same again the console is showing the branch nae but the php is throwing an error
[11:54:38] <robertmaxrees> clearcut https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/adsense/VF3Jt--JuHE
[11:55:02] <robertmaxrees> blinky_ try crafting the URL manually and hit it like a normal page.
[11:55:12] <robertmaxrees> pampuchy wut
[11:55:34] <clearcut> robertmaxrees, thank you
[11:55:48] <robertmaxrees> clearcut try google next time ;)
[11:55:56] <blinky_> robertmaxrees: How do I add the GET into the URL?
[11:56:02] <robertmaxrees> blinky_ you don't.
[11:56:04] <robertmaxrees> it's a url.
[11:56:13] <robertmaxrees> a GET is like a normal page request.
[11:56:19] <pampuchy> robertmaxrees:i need some sliders ona  webpage, so that i can vary them to control the font size. BUT, i need the values from these sliders to be fed into my SASS, so that i can process them a bit, THEN spit it out as css
[11:56:23] <pampuchy> is this possivle?
[11:56:41] <robertmaxrees> pampuchy that question doesn't make any sense.
[11:57:11] <pampuchy> why not?
[11:57:25] <robertmaxrees> "feed values into sass" doens't make any sense.
[11:57:30] <blinky_> robertmaxrees: OK I have navigatd to that page and it has the same errors.  The va_dump($_GET) is empty and the var_dump($_SESSION0 shows the branch to be NULL.
[11:57:42] <robertmaxrees> blinky_ then you need to ask in a channel about php :)
[11:57:50] <blinky_> ok cheers
[11:58:11] <pampuchy> well, the css of the page is generated by a bunch of sass mixins. the values from the jquery need to be fed to the sass mixins. is hat cle<ar now?
[11:58:38] <robertmaxrees> sure - not doable.
[11:58:46] <robertmaxrees> jquery is in page, sass is before that happens.
[11:59:14] <pampuchy> ok! thanks bobby
[11:59:19] <robertmaxrees> *robert ;)
[11:59:45] * CssNoob good morning and good night y'all
[12:00:46] <cjohnson> sass can be rendered with a JS renderer of some kind I believe
[12:00:51] <cjohnson> but yuck
[12:00:54] <robertmaxrees> not for production use.
[12:00:54] <robertmaxrees> ever
[12:01:00] <robertmaxrees> and not for what he wants to do.
[12:02:13] <cjohnson> ah I see
[12:02:43] <robertmaxrees> that starts munging separations of concern, anyway.
[12:05:02] <P0rk> which is better    if (targ.is(".fieldOptions .radioBox"))    or if (targ.closest("fieldOptions").length)   ?
[12:05:14] <robertmaxrees> depends on the use case
[12:05:24] <robertmaxrees> i'd default to the second one probably.
[12:05:35] <P0rk> cool. thanks.
[12:20:42] <respek> robertmaxrees: I fixed it, not totally sure how, but I did
[12:21:03] <robertmaxrees> respek awesome :)
[12:21:10] <robertmaxrees> sometimes exploring fixes things hahahaha
[12:21:21] <respek> there were other actions affecting the div and IDs in question. so I put them in the else statement instead of in the other file and viola
[12:33:04] <tharkun> What tool is there to debug jquery on a mobile phone? I'm using just a simple cascade plugin but on some devices it is extremely slow.
[12:34:08] <P0rk> what is the jquery pseudo selector for all input elements, meaning select, textarea, input, button, etc.?
[12:34:09] <BillCriswell> tharkun: Safaris Inspector can inspect mobile safari.
[12:34:28] <BillCriswell> If connected to the USB.
[12:38:27] <doug64k> P0rk: :input
[12:38:56] <P0rk> such a thing of beauty. I must have another issue,then. Thanks.
[12:39:03] <doug64k> lol
[12:39:13] <doug64k> np
[12:39:49] <doug64k> sorry, just sounded funny for a moment... "selector for all the input elements..."   ->  :input
[12:42:04] <P0rk> I was afraid that :input === <input> elements only so I'd have to use :select or :textarea , etc.
[12:43:35] <P0rk> when managing complex states using classes in jquery, is there a better system than toggleClass or addClass, removeClass?
[12:44:55] <NoiseEee> P0rk: o
[12:45:08] <NoiseEee> P0rk: i'd say thats probably easiest
[12:46:37] <BillCriswell> Depending on how "statey" it is I like a simple class on the html element.
[12:47:18] <P0rk> NoiseEee BillCriswell doug64k, thanks for the reply. I guess I need to find a way to handle my logic better, I keep getting my object states messed up
[12:47:53] <BillCriswell> The classes on <html> is normally more for visual stuff though.
[12:48:05] <NoiseEee> well you might want to track 'states' in an object perhaps?  ie: a dict/lookup?
[12:49:42] <doug64k> P0rk: if you need to store state on elements, use $.data(elem, name [, setvalue]) to put an object on each element that can store tons of state
[12:50:16] <NoiseEee> thats also good. but if you need to grab existing "data-" stuff, use .attr('data-something') rather than $.data
[12:50:19] <doug64k> generally, only plugins need that much storage, but you never know
[12:50:30] <NoiseEee> perhaps you might explain your case a bit more / pastie, P0rk
[12:52:17] <P0rk> sorry, I was working on a fiddle to explain. brb
[13:14:33] <fredy_> Hi!
[13:15:46] <fredy_> good afternoon, I am looking for a way how to send  an index, take a look please: http://pastebin.com/kfVpDQhm
[13:16:13] <fredy_> the idea is to append to the url the value of "fileCount"
[13:16:35] <fredy_> so, with server side I am going to be able to read and process it
[13:36:49] <maddtech> Can anyone tell my why I'm getting this error: "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function".  http://www.codeshare.io/RyLFC
[13:37:25] <BillCriswell> maddtech: What line?
[13:37:40] <maddtech> 15
[13:37:52] <robertmaxrees> filterList isn't defined there.
[13:38:56] <maddtech> Sorry, line 9
[13:39:05] <robertmaxrees> mixItUp?>
[13:39:21] <BillCriswell> Alos, doing filterlist.hoverEffect() runs it immediately, not sure you want to do that.
[13:39:38] <maddtech> https://mixitup.kunkalabs.com/ is the plugin.  http://www.queness.com/post/14577/create-a-simple-responsive-portfolio-page-with-filtering-and-hover-effect
[13:40:04] <robertmaxrees> can you setup a functioning fiddle maybe?
[13:41:15] <BillCriswell> maddtech: Are you sure you included the plugin itself?
[13:41:39] <maddtech> Yes is did.  The hover effect works just fine.
[13:41:48] <maddtech> It's just the filtering.
[13:42:37] <BillCriswell> I'd try setting up a demo at jsfiddle.net
[13:42:38] <fredy_> hey maddtech, have you tried: onMixEnd: $this.hoverEffect
[13:42:39] <fredy_> ?
[13:43:00] <BillCriswell> onMixEnd: $this.hoverEffect won't do anything, there's no $this
[13:43:11] <maddtech> no.  I'm still very new to jQuery so I've been trying to play around with stuff to learn.
[13:43:30] <BillCriswell> maddtech: Much easier if you provide a demo.
[13:43:47] <fredy_> I was learning from codeschool.com
[13:44:03] <maddtech> They have a demo at http://www.queness.com/resources/html/simple-portfolio-page/index.html
[13:44:05] <fredy_> I recommend you maddtech that website
[13:44:20] <robertmaxrees> maddtech showing us their demo isn't going to help us fix your broken code.
[13:44:30] <robertmaxrees> we'd have to setup a fiddle at the end of the day, so go ahead and do it :)
[13:44:30] <maddtech> LOL.  Sorry.
[13:44:32] <maddtech> Hang one
[13:50:29] <maddtech> WTH.  The exact code works on JSFiddle.
[13:51:01] <robertmaxrees> any console errors on your site?
[13:52:10] <maddtech> Well evidently it was something with the min file.  I snagged a CDN and now it works on my site.
[13:52:53] <robertmaxrees> there you go.\
[13:53:29] <maddtech> Sorry to bug everyone.
[13:53:54] <robertmaxrees> that's why we're here.
[13:54:03] <robertmaxrees> sometimes you just need a rubber duck.
[13:55:11] <maddtech> lol
[13:59:43] <harrisonn> if i'm using a jqueryui selectmenu how do i make it so that very long list of options has a scrollbar
[13:59:49] <harrisonn> instead of extending downward into the page
[14:00:11] <Zzaichik> use CSS
[14:00:41] <Zzaichik> max-height: something; overflow-y: auto;
[14:05:05] <harrisonn> that doesn't work
[14:13:02] <P0rk> Here is a tragic example for demonstration purposes only. I need help organizing my logic to make sure things work: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/fqu9w9ca/
[14:17:49] <doug64k> just when you thought you really understood 'this': http://jsfiddle.net/Lnv5zpkx/
[14:18:38] <MikeD_> P0rk: Yes/No questions as checkboxes... to allow the YESNO possibility ?
[14:19:32] <robertmaxrees> doug64k except that code doesn't technically work.
[14:19:45] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lnv5zpkx/1/
[14:19:49] <P0rk> Mike_D, the checkboxes will be hidden
[14:19:52] <robertmaxrees> also: your returns are why that line would never get hit.
[14:20:23] <P0rk> the yes/no will only be visible and allows people to select yes...think about it and deselect yes without selecting no. That 's not a feature of a radio button
[14:21:08] <robertmaxrees> doug64k you're looking at an object that contains a primitive and comparing it against a primitive, so this !== 'Y'
[14:21:32] <MikeD_> well, that's crazy... but whatever. :)
[14:21:37] <robertmaxrees> if you bring coercion into the picutre, you get a truthy value, doug64k
[14:24:16] <robertmaxrees> doug64k at the end of the day, what you're doing isn't really a practical thing, so you'll never really have issues.
[14:24:19] <P0rk> MikeD_ would you feel less crazy if it said: Have Roommates, Live Alone, Not Living and you could only select one option>
[14:24:43] <Paradisee> hello \o/
[14:26:33] <MikeD_> those three things are mutually exclusive, right?  'unanswering' a question driving a repurpose of the circles to special-handled squares is disorienting
[14:26:50] <doug64k> robertmaxrees: first time I've seen "boxing" ever happen in js
[14:27:09] <MikeD_> if you are going to hide the squares and use some other style to indicate the selection, then yeah... i get it.
[14:27:42] <robertmaxrees> doug64k huh?
[14:27:55] <robertmaxrees> i think you're conflating how things get passed around, but okay
[14:28:06] <MikeD_> at first the script wasn't running and I'd selected both yes AND no... once the script worked and no deselected yes, it made more sense
[14:28:16] <doug64k> robertmaxrees: java and c# have a concept of wrapping a value type in an object. this is what is happening to the string primitive when it sets 'this' in the call
[14:28:27] <P0rk> cool. I was struggling to get that up as quick as possible to demonstrate my logic issue, not my multiple presentation issues. LOL Yeah, the final product looks much better. this was just to show the logic
[14:28:36] <doug64k> robertmaxrees: they call it 'boxing'
[14:28:49] <MikeD_> i'd still argue that it's not kosher, but you can put cat ears on a dog and teach it to meow then sure... you have a pet cat.
[14:29:08] <P0rk> but here is the thing: I want a deselectable radio button
[14:29:22] <P0rk> and having a third ("no choice") option sucks
[14:29:36] <MikeD_> you can hide the no choice option
[14:29:48] <P0rk> Then it doesn't make sense for the question
[14:29:56] <MikeD_> just like you'd be hiding the squares too
[14:30:26] <P0rk> and yes/no was just this example I also have about 5 other pairs that map to the same idea
[14:30:30] <doug64k> oh god not again. lol
[14:30:50] <robertmaxrees> doug64k i'm aware of the concept, but it's not something you deal with in JS much.
[14:30:53] <doug64k> someone comes along on a regular basis, wanting to force checkbox or radio button to do some different thing
[14:31:15] <P0rk> thats because the default implementation of both suck
[14:31:23] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:31:36] <robertmaxrees> they both do exactly what they're supposed to do.
[14:31:40] <P0rk> so rather than confuse the use with radio boxes or check boxes, I hide them and aske them to point at a label
[14:31:51] <P0rk> but not what I want them to do.
[14:32:03] <robertmaxrees> semantic markup is a great thing.
[14:32:30] <doug64k> P0rk: think of UIs as a language. people speak that language. you want to start speaking some foreign language to your users? people have expectations about checkboxes and radio buttons, and how to use them
[14:32:49] <MikeD_> input:checked+label { font-weight: bold; }  ?
[14:33:02] <robertmaxrees> and even when you hide them, relying on them for the core functionality they give is a great ide.a
[14:33:03] <P0rk> people understand point at the one you want and click it. They don't get radio buttons and checkboxes.
[14:33:13] <robertmaxrees> yes they do.
[14:33:14] <P0rk> Look at any giovernment form. They don't ever use them right
[14:33:17] <robertmaxrees> they've been trained to before you.
[14:33:27] <P0rk> most people don't know the difference
[14:33:32] <robertmaxrees> they learn quick.
[14:33:35] <robertmaxrees> trust me ;)
[14:33:36] <MikeD_> multiselect list box... now there's an abomination of UX  :p
[14:34:21] <P0rk> there is nothing wrong with having the user select an option by clicking on it. It doesn't need a friggin radio box or checkbox
[14:34:27] <MikeD_> you're using "government forms" to illustrate the failure of "radio vs checkbox" ??
[14:34:31] <robertmaxrees> it makes your job a lot easier.
[14:34:35] <robertmaxrees> take it from us.
[14:34:38] <P0rk> I'm working on government forms
[14:35:09] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what that has to do with anything.
[14:35:21] <MikeD_> <button>yes</button><button>no</button>
[14:35:51] <P0rk> MikeD_ great for forms.
[14:36:08] <MikeD_> "you can style it"
[14:36:17] <robertmaxrees> i work on a large network of ecommerce stores - everything we do is geared toward conversions.
[14:36:26] <MikeD_> as it should be
[14:36:48] <robertmaxrees> P0rk so trust me when I say that is does matter, at least as far as you and your fellow developer's sanity.
[14:36:53] <P0rk> the forms that I am working on are terrible and they have been using them for years
[14:36:54] <MikeD_> i miss the straightforward $$ motive, i've been working for/with doctors
[14:37:56] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ we try to actually help our customers, too, but it's great when we have that one baseline that we can always look back on.
[14:38:36] <MikeD_> "blind users care about semantic markup"  "I don't care about blind users"  "Googlebot is a blind user"  "Oh"
[14:38:58] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[14:40:10] <P0rk> I think html took a turn when it went semantic. They should have added a layer for semantics separate from html like css and instead of style="a bunch of css jibberish" we could do semantics="a bunch of semantic bullshit"
[14:40:21] <robertmaxrees> not imo.
[14:40:25] <P0rk> html should be for layout
[14:40:30] <P0rk> css should be for styling
[14:40:37] <robertmaxrees> correct - html was always about declariung and defining the data.
[14:40:43] <MikeD_> html is for markup
[14:40:50] <robertmaxrees> you can do so in a way that is semantic.
[14:41:01] <robertmaxrees> like using radios when you need radios and checkboxes when you need checkboxes ;)
[14:41:22] <MikeD_> and schnozberries when you need schnozberries
[14:41:46] <MikeD_> "table should be used for layout"
[14:41:52] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[14:41:53] <P0rk> The beauty of it is they want pdf forms after all is done
[14:42:14] <MikeD_> we really only need <div> - the rest of those tags are just confusing
[14:42:21] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[14:42:28] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_++
[14:44:00] <P0rk> It's funnyu how selfr-righteous developers are. It used to be, at least in this channel, that people would answer your question, then comment on how you could do it better. Now it's ridicule and shame for even asking and you end up without getting your question answered. I miss the good ole days.
[14:44:07] <MikeD_> P0rk: we all know that pain of working for an idiot (or a committee of them) - realize that if you are blindly following orders you know are wrong, you're not adding value, you're adding to the problem.
[14:44:19] <robertmaxrees> wow.
[14:44:49] <robertmaxrees> welp
[14:45:05] <MikeD_> wait, what?  you had a question?
[14:45:11] <robertmaxrees> he did, yeah.
[14:45:37] <MikeD_> I missed it because I didn't know how to make sense of the circles vs squares  (shapes are hard)
[14:45:48] <robertmaxrees> ooookay, time to let it go ;)
[14:46:45] <MikeD_> hmm...  sadquit makes me laugh
[14:47:07] <robertmaxrees> i can see why he may have felt that way, though.  sometimes people take joking around the wrong way.
[14:48:30] <MikeD_> *shrug*  sorry, joking is fun.
[14:48:50] <MikeD_> ttyl
[14:51:12] <doug64k> how does 'div' even make sense? division? more like container, but whatever :)
[14:51:32] <robertmaxrees> there are a lot of containers.
[14:51:44] <robertmaxrees> divisions, sections, spans, paragraphs, anchors, images...
[14:54:09] <Paradisee> how can i hide an image in a div and display another image? .hide/show ?
[14:54:38] <doug64k> Paradisee: you can just change the src of the image if you dont need a transition
[14:54:53] <Paradisee> doug64k: i have to make some kind of a carousel
[14:55:08] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, .hide() and .show().  or add/remove classes.
[14:55:26] <Paradisee> when i click on "add" it should remove the previus image and content, and show an empty space
[14:57:46] <robertmaxrees> without seeing exactly what you're working with it's hard to help you out.
[14:58:03] <robertmaxrees> it could involve removing things, deleting them, etc.
[15:02:19] <roysegall> Hi, i need help with query 1.10 -  i can't use double click with the on method. Any suggestions?
[15:02:34] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ roysegall
[15:02:35] <b-ot> roysegall: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:02:46] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: yap, its pretty hard
[15:03:45] <roysegall> robertmaxrees, https://gist.github.com/RoySegall/f3e1bbadc4dcf6b92c8a
[15:05:07] <robertmaxrees> dbclick is misspelled
[15:05:12] <robertmaxrees> dblclick
[15:06:05] <roysegall> robertmaxrees, :\. 10x. Shouldn't this be like the name of the method?
[15:06:29] <robertmaxrees> the name of the method is the same...
[15:06:34] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/dblclick/
[15:06:45] <robertmaxrees> "This method is a shortcut for .on( "dblclick", handler) in the first two variations, and .trigger( "dblclick" ) in the third."
[15:07:04] <robertmaxrees> and it's done the other way around - the convenience method is named after the event
[15:07:56] <roysegall> robertmaxrees i was prtty sure i used .dbclick before. Any way 10x
[15:10:31] <roysegall> by the way - why live was deprecated?
[15:10:39] <robertmaxrees> because everything was moved to .on()
[15:10:43] <robertmaxrees> for event binding
[15:56:25] <Hypfer> hi, how do I do something if someone clicks on an object in an svg which is inside an <img tag?
[16:04:25] <robertWorkBeer> select the element and bind a listener?
[20:54:15] * CssNoob good afternoon y'all
[21:15:04] <Libin> I have added a loading gif image in a lazy loading image grid
[21:15:08] <Libin> here is my code
[21:15:10] <Libin> $(jsonImages).each(function (i) {                                     $("#imagecontent").append('<div class="gridbox"><img class="picgrid" src="img/loading.gif" width="10px" height="10px"data-src="' + "http://cheeky9server.azurewebsites.net/Images/" + jsonImages[i].ImageUrl + "?width=100" + '"></div>');                                                                      });
[21:15:32] <Libin> how do i reduce the size of the gif. its taking the entire box
[21:37:08] <tharkun> I've just discovered jsfiddle.net and it shows a lot of javascript libraries. What is a rule of thumb to determin which library is best suited for a particular site?
[21:42:29] <sacho> que?
[21:43:40] <sacho> there's no rule of thumb - you use what you know and what you need
[22:16:45] <Larado> hi can somebody help me with a form submission issue, there are a few steps to get there, http://bit.ly/109Y1ND
[22:18:02] <Larado> hmm looks like there is a issue getting this to work to demo
[22:25:01] <Larado> so basic issue without an example is i have a <form></form> and <button> out of it, when i click the button i am submitting the form, and I know its calling the function coz i got a message, but the form does not get submitted
[22:25:09] <Larado> ie page does not change
[22:25:42] <Larado> im trying to get the localhost online without much luck right now
[22:26:44] <doug64k> Larado: did you check the debugger console?
[22:26:51] <Larado> there are no errors
[22:30:59] <doug64k> Larado: is the event handler on the form or the button?
[22:31:13] <Larado> on the form
[22:31:23] <doug64k> you are listening for submit event?
[22:32:27] <doug64k> Larado: i.e. $('form').on('submit', ...
[22:33:22] <Larado> form id="orderfrm" http://pastebin.com/u9jfEXB4
[22:33:42] <doug64k> Larado: anyway, in the browser debugger, activate the network tab, reload your page, and clear the network tab, then do what you think should post and look at network request
[22:33:48] <Larado> button id complete-order
[22:34:00] <Larado> there is nothing
[22:34:42] <doug64k> Larado: and the filters were set to show all network events?
[22:34:55] <Larado> yes
[22:35:12] <Larado> ok in the button i got jQuery("form#orderfrm").submit(); but no handler for the form from what you can see in the code
[22:35:27] <Larado> shouldnt that just submit it ?
[22:37:18] <doug64k> it is redundant to say form#orderfrm - it will lookup by id and if not found ignore the rest
[22:37:44] <doug64k> Larado: did you execute $('#orderfrm')  in the debugger console?
[22:38:43] <Larado> no
[22:38:51] <doug64k> or, at line 162, add: if ($('#orderfrm').length === 0) throw "where'd it go?";
[22:39:59] <doug64k> Larado: if that selector doesn't match, the .submit() will have no effect
[22:40:13] <doug64k> $('#asfasdfasdf').submit() works too. and no form submits either
[22:40:46] <Larado> nothing happens with line 162
[22:41:13] <doug64k> did you execute $('#orderfrm') in the debugger with that page ready to do a submit test run?
[22:41:15] <Larado> if ($('#orderfrm').length === 1) throw "where'd it go?";  shows the message
[22:41:24] <doug64k> ok
[22:41:27] <Larado> no
[22:41:58] <doug64k> Larado: #domregsubmit ??
[22:42:21] <doug64k> is that a parent of the form?
[22:42:22] <Larado> just ran $('#orderfrm')  and got form output in console
[22:42:25] <doug64k> or a typo
[22:42:39] <Larado> that is a different form
[22:42:40] <doug64k> line 113
[22:42:52] <doug64k> does that form have an action attribute?
[22:43:01] <Larado> its not on this page
[22:43:28] <doug64k> there is no submit handler.
[22:43:56] <doug64k> do you have a method= or action= attribute on the form?
[22:44:11] <Larado> method="post"
[22:44:19] <Larado> action="/whmcs/cart.php?a=checkout"
[22:44:58] <Larado> i cant seem to change the admin port of my router from 80 yo 8080 if not i could have probably got this online
[22:45:03] <Larado> the site doesnt work on any other port
[22:45:47] <Larado> unless you see something in the js, give me a few mins im trying to figure out the port issue
[22:46:15] <doug64k> Larado: ssh tunnel?
[22:46:27] <Larado> just wamp
[22:46:38] <doug64k> accept incoming req at port n, forward that to webserver at whatever port
[22:46:47] <doug64k> ok
[22:48:30] <doug64k> larado on line 162, put console.log($('#orderfrm').serialize())
[22:49:05] <doug64k> to be 100% sure it is the right form and it is still correct
[22:49:43] <Larado> can i pm you the output
[22:49:48] <doug64k> sure
[22:49:49] <Larado> dont want to flood in here
[22:50:07] <Larado> its the right form
[22:51:15] <doug64k> hmmm. I wonder if a stray submit handler is getting the event and calling preventDefault
[22:51:31] <doug64k> are there nearby or forms in the ancestors?
[22:51:44] <doug64k> forms nearby*
[22:52:30] <Larado> yeah there are a couple more forms, but its for language change and stuff like that, also i dont see any attached events
[22:52:52] <Larado> hmm let me try restarting the router
[22:52:54] <Larado> sec
[22:54:04] <doug64k> Larado: try adding this: $(document).on('submit', function() { console.log('gonna submit', event.isDefaultPrevented() ? 'yes!' : 'oh no!'); })
[22:54:21] <doug64k> Larado: try adding this: $(document).on('submit', function() { console.log('gonna submit', !event.isDefaultPrevented() ? 'yes!' : 'oh no!'); })
[22:55:11] <doug64k> oops, add (event) in the function parameters
[22:57:01] <doug64k> perhaps also log out $(event.target).prop('id')
[22:57:32] <Larado> is that line 162 aswell
[22:57:36] <doug64k> yes
[22:57:56] <doug64k> <doug64k> Larado: try adding this: $(document).on('submit', function(event) { console.log('gonna submit', !event.isDefaultPrevented() ? 'yes!' : 'oh no!'); })
[22:58:37] <doug64k> well, actually
[22:58:39] <Larado> gonna submit yes!
[22:58:43] <doug64k> no it goes at the top level
[22:58:56] <doug64k> same level as jQuery(...).click stuff there
[22:59:07] <Larado> yeaj
[22:59:08] <Larado> yeah
[22:59:17] <doug64k> says it is going to submit? then it submits!
[22:59:34] <Larado> yeah this is whats getting me aswell
[22:59:59] <doug64k> I would add console.log('id=', $(event.target).prop('id')) in there
[23:00:16] <doug64k> to be 200% sure it is an event from the right place
[23:00:38] <doug64k> because it's looking pretty strange at this point
[23:00:53] <Larado> do you have teamviwer ? if you wanted to try that
[23:01:02] <doug64k> yes
[23:01:07] <Larado> give me a sec
[23:50:11] <Larado> doug64k so you in the demo scene ?
