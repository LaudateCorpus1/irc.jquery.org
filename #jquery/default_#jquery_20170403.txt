[01:58:27] <Shazer[2]> Hi. Does anyone know much about Datatables?
[02:01:00] <Sacoo> hi
[02:02:04] <Sacoo> I've some questions about the trigger(), can anybody help me please?
[02:12:06] <Sacoo> I've some questions about the trigger(), can anybody help me please?
[02:13:59] <lowbro> just write out your question and wait for an answer, Sacoo
[02:16:32] <Sacoo> thanks lowbro, I'll do so
[02:24:20] <Sacoo> I'm going to send some params to an modal show event handler, so gonna use $("#mymodal").trigger("show.bs.modal) instead of $("#mymodal").modal("show"), the handler is triggered, but finally the modal does not displayed.
[02:25:45] <Sacoo> what's thewhat's the trick?
[02:29:09] <fanna> Is it possible to do an ajax call via url parameters ? I know how to do a basic ajax call and response. but for example you having something like .com/%hello%there%
[02:29:45] <Cork> fanna: that isn't parameters
[02:29:59] <Cork> its a none standard format and no that isn't built into ajax
[02:30:10] <Cork> you would have to append it to the url manually
[02:39:50] <Sacoo> I'm gonna send some params to a bootstrap modal "show" event handler while showing the modal, so gonna use $("#mymodal").trigger("show.bs.modal",[param1,param2]) instead of using default $("#mymodal").modal("show"), the handler is triggered, but the modal does not displayed finally. what's the trick?
[02:42:24] <Cork> Sacoo: i would recommend asking in ##bootstrap
[02:42:43] <Cork> Sacoo: the triggering "problem" is cause of something with the plugin, not jquery
[02:42:51] <Duikb00t> hola
[02:43:54] <Sacoo> thanks Cork, ok.
[03:43:13] <patsToms> is there any guide how old jquery boilerplate from jqueryboilerplate.com can be chainable?
[03:49:51] <Cork> patsToms: chainable as in?
[03:50:01] <Cork> $().plugin().method()?
[03:51:30] <patsToms> Cork, yes
[03:52:37] <Cork> patsToms: jquery doesn't work very well with that type of structure so it is normally avoided
[03:52:45] <patsToms> oh
[03:53:02] <Cork> cause jquery relays to heavily on chaining for its normal work flow
[03:53:19] <Cork> so the normal structure is $().plugin('function name')
[03:53:47] <Cork> patsToms: what enforces that in the boilerplate is line 58-63
[03:54:05] <Cork> (explicitly the return this.each()
[03:54:28] <Cork> that structure means the functions in the plugin can't ever return anything
[03:55:35] <Cork> and i would prob say that is a bit hard
[03:56:06] <Cork> but the entire boilerplate would have to be reconstructed to support a more dynamic solution
[03:56:29] <Cork> cause then the loop would have to go inside each function instead of having a separate instance for each element
[03:56:41] <Cork> (like how jquery does it)
[04:09:00] <patsToms> Cork, interesting. I have canvas element here and I would like to manipulate it with jquery plugin. It would work well but I would like to store some arrays together with it. Do something like generate() at init, and then draw() afterwards.
[04:09:49] <patsToms> so, plugin methods can't return, and seems like I can't save any data for next execution in plugin too
[04:09:55] <Cork> patsToms: you could always push it into .data() for the element
[04:10:14] <Cork> and then do things like $().data('pluginCanvas')
[04:10:20] <patsToms> oh, thanks for info
[04:10:27] <patsToms> i will do that
[04:10:47] <Cork> that's basically what the boilerplate does at the lines i talked about before
[04:13:35] <patsToms> Cork, somehow missed that, thanks again
[06:02:05] <Duikb00t> oeps
[06:02:21] <Duikb00t> Seems my mouse leave is being a bit buggy https://jsfiddle.net/cttxmq7q/1/
[06:02:29] <Duikb00t> I see what's going wrong but im not really sure houw to fix it.
[06:58:43] <Cork> Duikb00t: https://jsfiddle.net/cttxmq7q/7/
[06:59:00] <Cork> you want to make the btn_service bound on the li parent though
[06:59:10] <Cork> or you will have a very annoying experience
[06:59:27] <ace139> Hey could anyone help me out with setting the jquery ui autocomplete feature into the ckeditor ?
[06:59:56] <ace139> Been trying for sometime, not been able to do it.
[07:00:02] <Cork> Duikb00t: https://jsfiddle.net/cttxmq7q/8/
[07:00:04] <Woet> Duikb00t: https://jsfiddle.net/cttxmq7q/9/
[07:00:12] <Woet> yea that works too
[07:00:58] <Cork> Woet: moving over the dropdown doesn't work unless you move where the event is bound
[07:01:53] <Cork> ace139: haven't used ckeditor for ages, it will most likely be problematic to insert an autocomplete into a contenteditable element
[07:02:25] <ace139> Cork, trying to use this http://ckeditor.com/blog/CKEditor-for-jQuery
[07:02:34] <ace139> But not working
[07:03:22] <ace139> Cork, well textarea is also content editable right ? Autocomplete works like a charm.
[07:03:28] <Cork> ace139: that's just to integrate ckeditor as a plugin in jquery
[07:03:37] <Cork> it isn't for integrating jquery in ckeditor
[07:03:49] <Cork> ace139: no it isn't
[07:04:00] <Cork> input and textarea is replaced browser elements
[07:04:05] <ace139> Cork, could you explain please. I am very new to JQuery ?
[07:04:06] <Cork> it has a separate value
[07:04:17] <Cork> it isn't so much about jquery
[07:04:44] <Cork> it is how contenteditable elements work (meaning <div contenteditable="true"></div>
[07:05:07] <Cork> and it might be able to use autocomplete with it, but i'm not sure it is possible
[07:05:11] <ace139> Cork, the thing is I already have a running system, I would need to implement the autocomplete feature in CKeditor only. Any workaround you could suggest me ?
[07:05:49] <Cork> sorry no, it would require a deep knowledge into ckeditor, and like i said, haven't used it in a long time
[07:06:13] <ace139> Cork, refer me to someone who can help me out ?
[07:06:34] <Cork> you could check for a ckeditor channel?
[07:06:52] <ace139> Okay, let me try that out. Thanks mate.
[07:06:57] <Cork> http://ckeditor.com/forums/FCKeditor-2.x/IRC-channel-freenode
[07:07:08] <Cork> donno how active it is though
[07:07:14] <Cork> else you might have to check there forums
[07:07:35] <Cork> ugg that apparently is SO
[07:08:46] <ace139> Cork, no one in the channel
[07:08:47] <ace139> :P
[08:02:39] <halftroll> how could I iterate through all tags with foo property and add a different event listener depending on the value of foo ?
[08:04:40] <localh0st> halftroll: I guess $("[property]").each(..
[08:06:27] <halftroll> localh0st: great, thanks !
[08:19:32] <doria> hi guys. I'm experiencing a nasty flicker effect when switching background-image src on all browsers, except Chrome. I'm also preloading images and placing them in an offscreen canvas for later use. Any know fixes for this?
[08:26:20] <Cork> doria: might be memory pressure is evicting the image from memory so the browser has to parse it from the disk cache
[08:26:42] <Cork> doria: only way around that (if that is the cause) would be to reduce memory usage
[08:27:38] <doria> hi Cork. images are not that big (~700k)
[08:28:11] <Cork> doria: depends on how many + how much other things are going on
[08:28:57] <Cork> halftroll: it is prob better to delegate the event handler in those cases
[08:29:31] <Cork> $(document).on('other-event', '[property="foo"]', function() {})
[08:29:53] <Cork> much less number of event handlers (so makes a considerable speed difference for the page)
[08:30:38] <doria> AFAIK changing the background-image src triggers an  asynchronous image decode, hence the problem. Browsers first clear the drawing area (hence the "flicker") and then draw the image
[08:31:09] <Cork> doria: the image decode only happens if it needs to parse it from the disk cache again
[08:31:14] <Cork> but ya, you're basically right
[08:31:41] <halftroll> Cork: the problem is that the callbacks are different for each tag :\
[08:32:00] <Cork> halftroll: you could check that in the callback
[08:32:12] <halftroll> ohhh
[08:32:24] <halftroll> I see, nice..
[08:32:27] <doria> that's where I'm lost ... lol shouldn't the preloading take care of caching the image? (Btw... on the 2nd time image is shown .. no flicker)
[08:32:41] <Cork> something like $(document).on('my-event', '[property]', function() { callbacks[$(this).data('propertry')](); })
[08:32:45] <Cork> halftroll: ^
[08:33:22] <halftroll> Cork: nice, I will do that
[08:33:26] <Cork> doria: that just pulls the image from the server to the browsers cache (as long as there are space in the cache)
[08:34:14] <Cork> halftroll: the precache trick has been quite drastically reduced since the browsers moved to throws away images not actively used to draw the page (ex for elements off screen)
[08:34:20] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[08:34:23] <Cork> doria: ^
[08:35:16] <Cork> before the browser capt all images the page reloaded as decoded versions in ram
[08:36:14] <Cork> but that could make pages balloon in memory usage so the eviction technique was implemented
[08:36:34] <Cork> and if the browser throws out the decoded image and the disk is "slow enough" there isn't much you can do about it
[08:36:45] <Cork> at least not that i know of
[08:37:09] <halftroll> Cork: oh... there's other problem, the events that trigger the callbacks are also different
[08:37:29] <Cork> halftroll: you mean the event name you want to listen to=
[08:37:31] <Cork> *?
[08:37:44] <halftroll> yes, first example is on('change'
[08:37:54] <Cork> how many different ones are there?
[08:38:05] <Cork> if it is just 2-3 then just bind them all
[08:38:21] <Jmann> Hi , I have made a quiz with questions. But now I duplicate my js code, is there any better way to do this?  ---> http://jsfiddle.net/eXSrq/16/
[08:38:23] <halftroll> not sure, for now change and click
[08:38:28] <Cork> on('change input paste' ...
[08:38:36] <halftroll> ok
[08:38:45] <Cork> click might be problematic though
[08:38:53] <Cork> as you can click any element
[08:39:30] <halftroll> yes :\
[08:40:23] <Cork> Jmann: what exactly is it you want it to do?
[08:40:35] <Cork> hide the current input field when you focus out from it and show "the next"?
[08:41:01] <JStudent> hey
[08:41:46] <JStudent> Is there way to create listener for this kind of situation, trigger function when or if already html element is blurred?
[08:42:25] <Jmann> Cork. I want to have 5 questions. If first is correct then show question2... and so on
[08:42:58] <Jmann> Else echo Wrong answer
[08:45:52] <Cork> Jmann: http://jsfiddle.net/eXSrq/17/ ?
[08:46:12] <Cork> moved from focus based to hitting enter
[08:46:25] <Cork> but the same structure should work for blur
[08:47:12] <Cork> JStudent: there isn't an event for if something already are something, that's a state
[08:47:31] <Cork> JStudent: you can get the currently focused element with document.activeElement
[08:47:57] <Cork> so if target != document.activeElement == not focused
[08:48:32] <JStudent> ah okay so there is no way of listening state
[08:48:41] <JStudent> like listen .is(...) return
[08:48:43] <Cork> JStudent: events are for when things change
[08:48:51] <Cork> not for what things are
[08:48:59] <Cork> so .is isn't an event
[08:49:23] <JStudent> Yeah but is there a way to create event for is. to change?
[08:49:26] <Cork> you can use $(this).is(':focused') but it uses document.activeElement
[08:49:43] <Cork> JStudent: that question makes no sense
[08:49:51] <Cork> .is isn't an event so no it can't trigger events
[08:50:13] <Cork> you can bind focus or blur to catch when element loses or gains focus
[08:50:23] <Cork> but you can't get a focus for what things are, it makes no sense
[08:50:45] <Cork> it would require the browser to constantly fire events and do nothing else
[08:50:56] <JStudent> aah okay yeah i was just wondering something like this:
[08:50:57] <JStudent> when($("#id").is(":focus"), function(...callback
[08:51:19] <Cork> that would be $('#id').on('focus', function() {})
[08:51:31] <Cork> "when #id gets focus call this event handler"
[08:51:45] <JStudent> yea but problem is, if its already focused
[08:51:56] <Cork> then when doesn't make any sense
[08:52:16] <Cork> if you want to handle page load just do $('#id').trigger('focus')
[08:52:18] <JStudent> when(($("#id").is(":focus") == true), function(...callback
[08:52:22] <JStudent> i mean it like that
[08:52:33] <Cork> that is still the same as $('#id').on('focus', function() {})
[08:52:51] <pachet> JStudent on some reals though your main impediment here is going to be javascript semantics, not jquery twiddling
[08:52:57] <Cork> you want to call a function if when you run the line something is focused
[08:52:59] <Cork> that isn't events
[08:53:45] <Cork> events says "browser, when you do x notify me so i can react to it"
[08:53:52] <Cork> it isn't bound to when you actually run that line
[08:54:37] <JStudent> I dont understand
[08:54:47] <Cork> JStudent: so an alternative would be if($('#id').is(':focus')) { callback() }
[08:55:01] <Cork> that runs callback if #id is focused when that line runs
[08:55:15] <Cork> but it won't do anything when the focus changes
[08:55:24] <Cork> THAT is what events are fore
[08:55:26] <Cork> -e
[08:55:39] <JStudent> Yeah but the problem is, the thing might be focused like little time after it so at the time that line is ran, condition is not true
[08:55:55] <Cork> then you want event handler
[08:56:07] <Cork> if you want to catch if it isn't focused, you want the if case
[08:56:13] <Cork> if you want both you need both
[08:56:57] <Cork> so $('#id').on('focus', callback); if($('id').is(':focus')) { $('#id').trigger('focus'); }
[08:57:02] <Cork> gah...
[08:57:05] <Cork> so $('#id').on('focus', callback); if($('#id').is(':focus')) { $('#id').trigger('focus'); }
[08:58:24] <JStudent> uhm let me see il try it
[08:59:27] <pachet> it'll try you
[09:00:40] <JStudent> :D
[09:00:55] <JStudent> How long you people have programmed and what languages, just curious
[09:01:39] <pachet> 78 years, just cobol
[09:02:29] <JStudent> lmao
[09:03:24] <JStudent> Is it appropriate to ask questions like this here?
[09:03:28] <JStudent> that*

[09:06:40] <JStudent> thats a nice!

[12:01:38] <rjCousineau> Hello. I'm trying to display a <div> on hover.  I use .on('mouseover') but on('mouseleave') doesn't always fire.  so to fix 'mouselave' I set $(document).on('mouseover') to remove the hover elements.. This isn't a very good solution, is there a better "on hover" solution?
[12:07:57] <shoky_> rjCousineau: if it's possible to do it with css :hover that's the best solution (can be done even if the div you're showing is not the one being hovered, sometimes)
[12:08:24] <shoky_> rjCousineau: otherwise, mouseenter and mouseleave are usually what you want  (not mouseover/mouseout)

[12:38:07] <Whiskey> if you copy in this code, https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.0.js and try to match jQuery you get "SyntaxError: unterminated string literal"
[12:40:04] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey show us the erroring version, then.
[12:41:07] <Whiskey> i can´t you need to copy and paste the code
[12:41:13] <robertmaxrees> why do I need to???
[12:41:23] <robertmaxrees> and where am i copy/pasting it to?
[12:41:24] <Whiskey> if you will see the error
[12:41:29] <Whiskey> the fiddle
[12:41:32] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:41:36] <robertmaxrees> where are you pasting it?
[12:41:38] <Whiskey> wait i can show you in rubular :D
[12:41:49] <robertmaxrees> just update the fiddle >.>
[12:42:14] <Whiskey> http://rubular.com/r/GxXVjZjMfu like that
[12:42:18] <Whiskey> i don´t think it will save it
[12:42:20] <robertmaxrees> uh
[12:42:25] <robertmaxrees> it will.
[12:43:39] <robertmaxrees> but also: that's kind of a weird way to test something.
[12:43:47] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to test with that specific version of jquery?
[12:43:53] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: as i thinked, fiddle don´t save the text inside it
[12:44:05] <Whiskey> No i just know this errors
[12:44:13] <Whiskey> and its a problem that don´t should be there
[12:44:44] <robertmaxrees> you mean you're putting the jquery source into the text field and then running regex against it?
[12:44:53] <Whiskey> yeh
[12:45:19] <robertmaxrees> that error has nothing to to jquery jQuery.
[12:45:26] <robertmaxrees> *to do with
[12:45:29] <Whiskey> OKM
[12:45:40] <robertmaxrees> the g flag is causing your issue.
[12:46:21] <robertmaxrees> but also: why are you running regex against the jquery source?
[12:46:50] <Whiskey> i just test its limits
[12:47:28] <robertmaxrees> it's a ruby regular expression editor... not really sure what limits you're exploring heh
[12:47:44] <Whiskey> no its a javascript regexp editor
[12:48:19] <robertmaxrees> it's a js implementation of it.
[12:48:30] <robertmaxrees> but that's meant for ruby regex, which is distinct from js.
[12:48:53] <Whiskey> you sure, i have build alot of it
[12:49:05] <Whiskey> only thing that match rubular is the style
[12:49:06] <robertmaxrees> of this regex editor?
[12:49:14] <Whiskey> yeh
[12:49:26] <robertmaxrees> the one on rubular?
[12:49:35] <Whiskey> no not that one the fiddle one
[12:50:02] <Whiskey> well build, i did alot of changes from the orginal source of it
[12:50:05] <Whiskey> to match rubular
[12:50:19] <robertmaxrees> you didn't make enough changes apaprently.
[12:51:14] <Whiskey> :P
[12:51:24] <Whiskey> seems to be html escaping problem
[12:51:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:52:20] <robertmaxrees> either way, I'm not getting any errors in the fiddle with the use case you described.
[12:53:16] <Whiskey> what browser?
[12:53:20] <robertmaxrees> FF
[12:53:40] <Whiskey> https://snag.gy/kfnJYO.jpg
[12:54:27] <Whiskey> the line hat fail is "script = jQuery( "<script>" ).prop( {"
[12:54:40] <Whiskey> its the <script> thing
[12:55:15] <robertmaxrees> script = jQuery( "<script>" ).prop( { is a valid thing to do.
[12:56:03] <Whiskey> its just read out the <script> wrong
[12:58:31] <L4yer> hi guys, anyone know, how can I easily get date using datepicker without time? only dd mm yyyy? Id like to get something like Mon Apr 03 2017 00:00:00
[12:59:05] <robertmaxrees> https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#date-formats
[12:59:06] <robertmaxrees> l4ci
[12:59:11] <robertmaxrees> err, woops.  L4yer
[13:00:54] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: think something like this
[13:01:04] <Whiskey> const test = text($test.val()); <- to escape html inside the text
[13:01:27] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey but you don't wnat to escape the html.  you want the original entities when dealing with regex.
[13:02:18] <Whiskey> hmmm so why does <script> break it
[13:02:29] <robertmaxrees> probably trying to evaluate it incorrectly.
[13:03:08] <Whiskey> that means
[13:03:18] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:04:38] <Whiskey> if i remove that line "script = jQuery( "<script>" ).prop( {" i can read the whole document
[13:04:52] <robertmaxrees> *script
[13:04:55] <robertmaxrees> not a document.
[13:05:05] <Whiskey> well it will be, as long it don´t has js in end of it
[13:05:07] <robertmaxrees> and you need to then fix the way the regex is evaluating that text.
[13:05:11] <L4yer> robertmaxrees, thank you, I already read that and didnt help... when Im getting date it returns Datetime format, using $('#startDate').datepicker( "getDate" );
[13:05:15] <robertmaxrees> no, it won't be a doucment.
[13:05:17] <robertmaxrees> it'll be text.
[13:05:21] <robertmaxrees> there's a differemnce.
[13:05:35] <Whiskey> well a paper to me whit text is a document to me
[13:05:50] <robertmaxrees> in web dev, "document" has a special meaning.
[13:06:22] <robertmaxrees> can be real confusing to other people if you toss that word out when you don't actually mean what you think it means,.
[13:06:57] <Whiskey> anyways, i don´t know whats wrong whit my regex check, everything else works fine
[13:07:08] <Whiskey> however, it will read the line wrong for some reason
[13:08:50] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/ku1rf0w3/2/ i'd hope over to ##javascript and ask them why you get the error with this.
[13:09:45] <Whiskey> well that has still same problem :D
[13:10:13] <robertmaxrees> sure
[13:11:27] <Whiskey> https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/ku1rf0w3/3/ <-- click on try an example and you get the error :D
[14:05:38] <Kartagis> Cork: thank you for your answer about 4 hours ago :)
[14:19:06] <MikeD_> Whiskey: - that looks crazy
[14:30:59] <Kartagis> why would a click handler not work?
[14:31:09] <MikeD_> because it's broken
[14:31:14] <robertmaxrees> you're binding to an element that doesn't exist at the time of binding
[14:31:55] <MikeD_> define "not work"
[14:32:10] <robertmaxrees> it's unemployed.
[14:32:21] <MikeD_> i was going to say that too :)
[14:34:26] <MikeD_> i also think it's weird to dump a question like that and not be around for several minutes to clarify anything about it
[14:34:38] <robertmaxrees> it happens pretty frequently.
[14:35:06] <MikeD_> i guess that's the equivalent of my coworker that stops by my desk on his way outside for a smoke break, "Can you help me...   i'm going out"
[14:35:21] <MikeD_> why don't you wait to pester me with stupid stuff until you are on the way BACK?  :P
[14:36:36] <robertmaxrees> some people also like to ask the same thing in multiple channels without considering that it's kind of rude.  especially when they don't follow up and say they figured it out.
[14:38:45] <Kartagis> sorry, one sec
[14:40:10] <Kartagis> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/mvKJmPSLNFyO~N2eAyElBV5M1UNdIGYhyRLivL9gydE=/
[14:41:40] <Kartagis> should I use document ready?
[14:41:45] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[14:41:45] <robertmaxrees> something tells me the elements don't exist at the time of binding.
[14:41:45] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[14:41:45] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[14:41:46] <robertmaxrees> that may or may not fix the problem.
[14:41:48] <robertmaxrees> try doc ready, but those images are getting created in a different event.
[14:41:56] <robertmaxrees> rather, a handler for a different event.
[14:44:55] <Kartagis> so, I should use something like $(document).on("click", ".imgHolder",function() { ...;}) ?
[14:45:25] <robertmaxrees> a delegated handler, yeah.  bind down further than document tho.
[14:46:31] <Kartagis> $('body') ?
[14:46:38] <robertmaxrees> make it contextual.
[14:47:06] <robertmaxrees> looks like #images exists.
[14:47:08] <robertmaxrees> i'd use that.
[14:47:17] <Kartagis> owkay
[14:47:21] <robertmaxrees> $('#images').on('click', '.imgHolder', function() {});
[14:49:27] <Kartagis> cannot read property 'split' of undefined
[15:22:12] <AliG1000> I am using Mapzen for address searches, but I need to limit the number of API requests (currently it is every keup event in the search box).  How can I limit this?  The search box is created by an external .js script, and a class is provided for the box.  My current code is here: https://jsfiddle.net/Lsoyvr8j/
[15:22:42] <robertmaxrees> throttle or debounce it
[15:23:27] <robertmaxrees> one enforces a minimum time to elapse between each call, the other simply waits for the user to finish.
[15:23:52] <Kartagis> is it possible to iterate over localStorage keys BUT only containing numbers?
[15:23:59] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:25:04] <hlve> wat
[15:25:10] <AliG1000> throttling like this: http://jsfiddle.net/missinglink/19e2r2we/
[15:25:14] <AliG1000> ?
[15:25:25] <robertmaxrees> if you have lodash/underscore, sure.
[15:26:11] <Kartagis> nvm
[15:26:23] <Kartagis> nvm, I'll just use an array
[15:42:58] <Hoder> Does anyone have any experience with Team Treehouses' full stack javascript course? Would you recommend it?
[15:45:31] <robertmaxrees> i often hear people suggest codecademy's course
[15:48:33] <Hoder> I've gone through code academy, but I feel like it teaches more of "how to type this" rather than "how to understand it"
[15:49:03] <Hoder> similarly to, if I taught you the alphabet, but didn't teach you how to form those letters into words or sentences
[15:50:01] <robertmaxrees> most tutorials are probably going to focus on showing you the available tools and what they do.  best way to learn imo is to just start building stuff.
[15:57:15] <Hoder> Yeah I do a pretty good job at building stuff from piecing things I find online together, but that definitely can be improved
[16:39:28] <sbs> hi
[16:39:34] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon.
[16:39:55] <sbs> does anyone know if there is a feedback to bootstrap progressbar display complete?
[16:40:04] <robertmaxrees> feedback?
[16:40:07] <robertmaxrees> or mean a callback?
[16:40:16] <sbs> I have a process that runs way faster than the progress can travel
[16:40:36] <sbs> so my process ends at 100% but the pb did not reach it's travel end
[16:40:42] <sbs> yes callback if there is one
[16:41:06] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing anything in the docs.  though it's pretty much just markup.
[16:41:07] <sbs> I could not call the pb refresh before the previoius one actually completed
[16:41:32] <robertmaxrees> since you're setting the bar manually, I'd just do your check in that code.
[16:41:47] <sbs> what should I check in my code ?
[16:42:04] <robertmaxrees> the code that sets the progressbar.
[16:42:32] <sbs> my code is something like function Progress(pct) {$.("#pbid").css("width",Pct+"%")}
[16:42:39] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:43:00] <sbs> I call it very often (and don't display each time) but the pb stil does not follows
[16:43:05] <robertmaxrees> so in that function, you'd check what the Pct is and do something when it meets the 100% condition
[16:43:28] <sbs> no, I made myself unclear
[16:43:41] <robertmaxrees> i feel like you're bouncing between two issues - one is that it's not updating fast enough for you, and the other is that you're looking for a callback.
[16:43:54] <sbs> I do not need a callback
[16:44:06] <sbs> just fast enough updating of the progressbar
[16:44:41] <robertmaxrees> have you tried just turning them off?
[16:44:57] <sbs> ?? turning them off, you not show progress to the user ??
[16:45:04] <robertmaxrees> the animations i mean
[16:45:13] <sbs> how do I turn animations off for pb?
[16:45:30] <robertmaxrees> google :)
[16:45:33] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9622043/turn-off-bootstraps-css3-transitions-on-progress-bars
[16:45:37] <sbs> ok fait enough
[16:51:31] <sbs> ok I tried remove active, and hiding/showing, but the pb still does not reach 100%
[16:52:08] <sbs> and i can see there is still animamtion, when the process slows down because it downloads, the progress bar "catches up"
[16:57:15] <sbs> fwiw, the transation clause in the css did it. thxs
[16:57:23] <sbs> transition
[20:03:39] <latemus> i was using .html('heres the html code') to populate a div. when i moved the html code into another file, and used .load('path to the html file'), later jquery calls on elements by id, which come from this (now) external html file, and .load-ed into the parent div, are not accessible by jquery, why?
[20:04:09] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean by "are not accessible by jquery"?
[20:04:31] <robertmaxrees> do you have event bindings on contents of that element that stop working?
[20:04:49] <latemus> robertmaxrees: YES
[20:04:57] <latemus> robertmaxrees: thats what im trying to explain
[20:05:02] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean it's not accessible: you're hitting a race condition.
[20:05:05] <latemus> is it a bug or am i violating some rule
[20:05:06] <robertmaxrees> .load() is async - it uses ajax.
[20:05:21] <robertmaxrees> so you have to wait until it's done to do your event bindings OR use event delegation
[20:05:23] <latemus> robertmaxrees: okay. is there a better method to use in this cale
[20:05:37] <latemus> s/cale/case
[20:05:38] <robertmaxrees> delegation.
[20:05:44] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[20:05:50] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[20:06:05] <latemus> robertmaxrees: perfect. thank you, thank you so much!
[20:06:09] <robertmaxrees> yep!
[20:23:20] <AliG1000> How can I join two json objects together so that the contents of both are searchable using the search box? https://jsfiddle.net/fuL5wsbj/
[20:23:55] <robertmaxrees> i see one object in there.
[20:23:58] <robertmaxrees> where's the second?
[20:25:05] <robertmaxrees> also: what kind of browser support do you need?
[20:25:27] <AliG1000> when you type in the search box, results are retrieved from Mapzen (I assume an object also).  Is there a way to join them together?
[20:25:48] <robertmaxrees> join /what/ together?  the object from mapzan and... ?
[20:26:40] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused because your question posits 2 objects, but you keep only talking about one :)
[20:26:40] <AliG1000> join the object from Mapzen and the object in the stops variable
[20:27:17] <robertmaxrees> does mapzen have some kind of callback where you can mess with the data before it does stuff with it?
[20:28:04] <AliG1000> it does, yes:  https://mapzen.com/documentation/mapzen-js/search/#methods
[20:28:31] <robertmaxrees> and what kind of browser support?
[20:28:56] <robertmaxrees> 'cause if you've got babel available, you can use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign
[20:29:05] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, https://api.jquery.com/jquery.extend/
[20:29:30] <robertmaxrees> well, babel or don't carea about some older browsers.
[20:30:29] <AliG1000> I'll take a look at those, thank you
[23:28:00] <ace139> Can someone help me out with http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43183530/implement-jquery-ui-autocomplete-feature-in-ckeditor
[23:42:47] <Whiskey> Why does this not work? https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/ku1rf0w3/7/ "line 155"
[23:44:40] <pavonia> What doesn't work?
[23:45:24] <Whiskey> I was hope that would escape the text
[23:45:36] <Whiskey> you need to click on try an example
[23:46:42] <Whiskey> i try to slove this problem -> https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/ku1rf0w3/3/ <- also need to be executed by clicking on the "try an example"
[23:47:36] <pavonia> I don't see such a button/link
[23:47:52] <Whiskey> o start, enter a regular expression and a test string.
[23:47:52] <Whiskey> Or you can try an example.
[23:48:51] <pavonia> How do you "activate" the evaluation?
[23:49:09] <Whiskey> i don´t get what you mean
[23:49:18] <Whiskey> click on "try an example." and the regexp test runs
[23:49:24] <Whiskey> or just do it manually
[23:49:55] <pavonia> As I said, I don't see anything with that label to click on, maybe it's just my browser
[23:52:28] <Whiskey> pavonia: maybe change browser then, https://snag.gy/4gBca7.jpg
