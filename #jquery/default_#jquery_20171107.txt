[01:51:36] <Neo1> Alina-malina, let's go to PM
[06:05:33] <Elirips> Hello. Stupid, but: How can '$(document).ready(...)' work? If I include jquery using <script>, how is it ensured that $(docuemnt) is not executed before jquery is loaded? Because if jquery is not loaded yet, '$' is not defined, or not?
[06:07:46] <localh0st> Elirips: https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[06:10:21] <Cork> Elirips: the browser ensures that the script tag including jquery is loaded and executed before following tags are executed
[06:10:49] <Cork> Elirips: so it has nothing to do with .ready; .ready is to ensure that the dom is loaded and calculated, not jquery
[06:11:13] <Elirips> Cork: thank you. Is that a general rule, that the browser will ensure all script tags are loaded, before any function is run?
[06:18:28] <moveax> click the link, there it says:  Code included inside $( document ).ready() will only run once the page Document Object Model (DOM) is ready for JavaScript code to execute
[06:23:20] <Elirips> moveax: that does not explain how it works that it is ensured that '$' is defined (means: jquery script has been loaded) before the line containing '$' is run
[06:24:01] <Elirips> moveax: what if there is one <script> that includes jquery, and another <script> that includes some foo.js. Is it legal inside foo.js to do $(document).ready?
[06:24:08] <Elirips> or does it matter on the order of the script tags?
[06:24:46] <moveax> if you use jquery somewhere make sure the DOM is ready
[06:25:09] <moveax> if the dom is ready, the script elements are processed
[06:37:41] <Cork> Elirips: no, i didn't say before any function runs
[06:38:04] <Cork> Elirips: <script src="script1"></script><script src="script2"></script>
[06:38:15] <Cork> script1 will run before script2 is executed
[06:38:25] <Cork> the html standard requires this
[06:38:46] <Cork> if a browser doesn't do this then they are none compliant
[06:40:42] <Cork> moveax: that isn't exactly how it works, and the question is about how script execution works, not so much how .ready works
[06:41:30] <Elirips> Cork: thank you
[07:56:07] <Deusdeorum> Does jQuery UI Slider have a function to style everything left of the handle to a certain color? Reading in the docs I thought I could just use .ui-slider-range { background: red; } but this will color all of the slider range red.
[08:11:12] <Cork> Deusdeorum: if you can't find a css class you can use the _render function to add custom markup to your dropdown
[08:12:07] <Deusdeorum> Cork thanks for answering, do you have any reading i can catch up on there?
[08:12:26] <Cork> its listed as one of the demos on the doc page
[08:12:52] <Deusdeorum> after further reading i noticed that my slider is missing ui-slider-range-min
[08:13:05] <Cork> ah, damn... slider -_-'
[08:13:19] <Deusdeorum> basically something like this: https://jqueryui.com/slider/#colorpicker
[08:13:27] <Cork> sorry my head went loop side and i was thinking of autocomplete -_-'
[08:14:01] <Cork> for the slider i make the bar transparent, and then i wrap the element in an extra div and do the styling i want there
[08:14:18] <Cork> (and update it on the step event)
[08:14:29] <Cork> i don't know of a built in solution
[08:15:54] <Deusdeorum> I see, is there another way around it without manipulating the html? It's used within a survey and i am using a template not created by someone I know. I know dynamically know the percentage left of the handle - but i guess i cannot do much with that?
[08:16:17] <Cork> that's tougher
[08:16:44] <Cork> the best way to do this is by setting the width of an element, and you can't do that from js in ex. a :before element
[08:17:37] <Deusdeorum> darn it, aye thanks for helping out
[08:18:19] <Deusdeorum> probably easier to just re-do the slider
[08:19:08] <Cork> the structure i have is <div class="slider-extender"><div class="used"></div><input {this is where the normal slide element is added}></div>
[08:19:30] <Cork> Deusdeorum: you won't get much further without hitting the same problem anyway
[08:20:02] <Cork> Deusdeorum: if you don't need old browser support you can use <input type="range">
[08:20:13] <Cork> but it will give you the exact same problem though :)
[08:20:52] <Cork> but there at least it won't need all the ui element overhead
[08:24:09] <Deusdeorum> hmmm, true - i will take a look on input type range
[08:24:12] <Deusdeorum> ty
[08:24:16] <hellyeah> yo
[10:46:07] <aways> Hi all
[10:46:15] <taplar> hola
[10:46:58] <aways> Question about append ; I would like save an element like var t = $('#id').parents('li') and append it after like $('#otherId').append(t)
[10:47:21] <aways> But I didn't find how can do this
[10:48:31] <taplar> you can do exactly that
[10:49:05] <aways> taplar, not working
[10:49:11] <taplar> fiddle?
[10:49:16] <aways> But t.appendTo('#id') works
[10:49:18] <aways> why ?
[10:49:24] <aways> 2 sec
[10:51:32] <ChrisCwmbran> Does anyone here have knowledge of both JQuery and TinyMCE?
[10:55:21] <aways> taplar, https://jsfiddle.net/acjephxr/1/
[10:55:30] <aways> but it's works fine here ...
[10:55:46] <aways> I don't undersand why on my code not
[10:56:16] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/acjephxr/2/  you don't need the remove
[10:56:33] <taplar> the DOM is a tree.  a node can only have a single parent
[10:56:41] <taplar> jQuery will do the detaching for you
[10:57:49] <aways> taplar, yes but the final system remove the form element if not needed. And add it after if condition
[10:58:10] <taplar> ah
[10:58:17] <aways> With remove and save i keep the definition
[10:58:30] <taplar> you should use detach rather than remove
[10:58:48] <aways> taplar, detach ?
[10:58:49] <taplar> if there is a chance that you will put it back
[10:58:57] <aways> it's unknown from me
[10:59:04] <taplar> detach() is like remove(), except remove() preforms jQuery cleanup of the element
[10:59:13] <taplar> detach() just takes it out of the dom
[10:59:24] <taplar> so if you know you are going to destroy it and not use it again, use remove()
[10:59:31] <taplar> otherwise if you may attach it again, use detach()
[10:59:37] <aways> Ok thanks !
[11:09:42] <aways> taplar, it's possible to save the previous position
[11:15:35] <taplar> probably
[13:22:37] <sinopia> Hello, it's possible to replaceAll text if a string is found?
[13:23:02] <sinopia> For example in a <td id="price">Test</td> if Test is found replace with 123 for example
[13:23:33] <taplar> $('#price').text() === 'Test'
[14:13:37] <guest354> is this book too old to study jquery? http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920016182.do
[14:14:33] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/ http://try.jquery.com/
[14:14:44] <robertmaxrees> that book is 7 years old and costs money :)
[14:14:49] <robertmaxrees> Gonna be pretty out of date.
[14:15:01] <guest354> it's based on 1.1.4
[14:15:06] <guest354> too irrelevant?
[14:15:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[14:15:23] <robertmaxrees> we're on 3.x now.
[14:15:36] <guest354> ok
[14:15:48] <robertmaxrees> any reason learn and try?
[14:15:55] <robertmaxrees> *you can't just use learn and try.
[14:16:38] <robertmaxrees> all the stuff it covers you can get in the official docs, and those are generally up to date :)
[14:18:35] <guest354> jquery in action authors recommend avoiding $(document).ready() and put everyhting just before closing body tag. How important is that?
[14:19:28] <guest354> learn.jquery tells no such thing
[14:19:31] <taplar> it's a recommendation
[14:22:10] <robertmaxrees> guest354 think of it this way:L
[14:22:40] <robertmaxrees> if web technologies are constantly evolving and changing, could you rely on the suggestions of a 7 year old book?
[14:22:53] <guest354> jquery in action is 2015
[14:23:02] <robertmaxrees> no need for any of them tbh.
[14:24:05] <robertmaxrees> just use the learning center and the API reference for now.  try is a good one, too.
[15:25:13] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/08n97r5p/   how to detect the click in the button? + or - ? and hide the other? if user press + hidde the - or viceverza?
[15:25:40] <robertmaxrees> so if the user presses the plus, hide the corresponding -?
[15:26:19] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 easy - start with the basics: how do you select another button in the same group?
[15:26:34] <jak2000> yes
[15:26:56] <jak2000> nearest? closest?
[15:27:02] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:27:07] <robertmaxrees> which of those is an actual jquery method?
[15:27:23] <jak2000> i think nearest?
[15:27:34] <robertmaxrees> easy way to find out with a google search.
[15:27:49] <robertmaxrees> i'd go to the cloeset common parent of the two buttons, then find the one you didn't click.
[15:31:07] <jak2000> ok
[15:55:13] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you figure it ouit?
[15:55:14] <robertmaxrees> *out
[16:37:39] <hellyeah> howdy?
[16:59:19] <pragma-> hellyeah: no thanks
[17:05:44] <hellyeah> pragma-:  what?
[17:08:55] <Aljone> Hey guys i wonder, i have a function that get calander data and update the view (going over alot of html and add/remove/update) , the rate of the update can be high since we have like 30 representives who work on the webapp and each time the scedule booking it spead and update the view for everyone. my problem is the update rate make the browser slow and unresonsive some times. i wonder what
[17:08:55] <Aljone> whould u suggest to solve this
[17:10:49] <robertmaxrees> use riot or react or vue or angular.
[17:10:54] <robertmaxrees> instead of doing it yourself.
[17:10:55] <pragma-> hellyeah: no... thanks.
[17:11:06] <robertmaxrees> Aljone
[17:18:27] <hellyeah> what the fuck
[17:19:17] <hellyeah> pragma-:  go away
[17:28:12] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[17:29:06] <pragma-> hellyeah: no thanks
[18:13:35] <dan_j> Hi. Whats the currently recommended way of blocking the back button? I'm asking in this channel first because I'm using jquery on the site.
[18:13:56] <dan_j> I've googled it and most results are quite old and all seem to say that no method is guaranteed to work.
[18:16:26] <dan_j> It's for a jquery webapp. I dont even want the page to refresh if possible. Or at least a confirmation asking if they want to proceed and reminding them that they'll lose their work
[18:22:14] <grapheti> dan_j, https://jsfiddle.net/zy3sbvcL/
[18:23:15] <grapheti> Prolly better to do: window.onbeforeunload = function() { return "Your work will be lost."; };
[18:24:01] <dan_j> thanks
[18:24:05] <grapheti> np
[18:29:40] <grapheti> dan_j, https://jsfiddle.net/zy3sbvcL/1/ (messages you when closing, refreshing, going back)
[18:30:10] <dan_j> got it. working nicely.
[18:30:13] <dan_j> thanks for the help
[18:30:28] <grapheti> np
[18:46:01] <jak2000> last fiddle that i am worked is: http://jsfiddle.net/08n97r5p/6/    but all the <td> was created dinamycally...... then  $(document).on("click", ".mychk1 input", function () {   $(this).parent().parent().find('.mychk2').hide();  });    <------------ this event not fire in my page.... why?
[20:52:39] <jameshalpert101> anyone know how to convert this curl get request into an ajax get request? https://pastebin.com/vPL0GCHR
