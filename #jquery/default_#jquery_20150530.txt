[00:34:24] <Whirled> hey all, I have an object that has something like 47 arrays for properties and I need to convert it to JSON so that there is only one array...any suggestions?
[00:35:36] <arthurvr> Whirled: so you just want to concat various arrays and then stringify it to a json string?
[00:35:43] <arthurvr> Whirled: how does that object look like?
[00:35:52] <arthurvr> Whirled: a fiddle/jsbin would be nice
[00:38:08] <Whirled> I tried to do it in jsfiddle, but it won't take that much stuff. Let me try a reduced case.. brb
[00:38:45] <arthurvr> Whirled: Just try to reduce it to less data (2 or three arrays is enough. I think you’ll get the idea)
[00:42:41] <Whirled> Well, so you can see what I started with and what I have now: Here is the original output I got from my friend's software: http://whirledorder.com/temp/inventory.htm
[00:43:11] <Whirled> a classic example of someone getting roughed up by css evangelists who hate tables. LOL
[00:44:11] <arthurvr> Oh that’s awful markup
[00:46:13] <Whirled> the worst.
[00:46:31] <Whirled> here is what I was able to pull out of it so far: http://whirledorder.com/temp/test4.html
[00:47:25] <Whirled> I literally used regular expressions to determine the left: css property and sorted it that way. Now I am just delirious...
[00:48:05] <Whirled> and the fun hasn't even started. This is just to load it into a damned Woo Commerce WordPress site...
[00:48:17] <arthurvr> sounds fun :(
[01:31:42] <Duvdevan> jQuery is the anti-christ!
[02:34:11] <ilhami> anyone who has used x-editable before? :P
[02:35:41] <ilhami> I want to know your experiences with it.
[03:31:42] <simpod> hello. can anyone help me? Lets say I have $("#elem").text($("#elem").html());. How can I address $("#elem") easier within text() function? I was wondering whether theres something like "this" property
[03:32:23] <simpod> my question is purely theoreticall, whether something like that exist. I know I can define that element before calling any functions on that
[04:06:53] <Mark_2> I have a question : how do i create a site like this that slides from the left when i click on the menu? Im just not sure if it’s iframe or ajax. can someone give me codes where I can start from?  https://www.connect2me.com/
[04:52:36] <earational> hey
[04:54:19] <arthurvr> hey earational
[04:54:29] <earational> wassup arthurvr ?
[04:55:08] <arthurvr> having fun hacking robots using javascript. Nodebots and johnny-five rock bro.
[04:57:19] <Mark_2> can anyone please help me with replicating this site’s sliding menu system? https://www.connect2me.com/
[04:57:26] <Mark_2> it slides from the left to right when i click on the menu.
[04:57:45] <Mark_2> is there any sophisticated way of making it work other than togglingclasses?
[04:58:23] <earational> arthurvr sweet
[04:58:59] <earational> Mark_2 the cleanest way should be toggling classes and using css animations imho
[05:00:26] <Mark_2> but if i use jQuery('.toggle').toggleClass('out’),
[05:00:52] <Mark_2> i’ll have to make cases for every single menu i click on
[05:01:00] <Mark_2> is there any better way?
[05:02:03] <Mark_2> what kind of css animation do you recommend though?
[05:02:37] <Mark_2> thought css toggling can handle the animation.
[05:19:46] <ramsub08> hello guys, I've a form in a page and a submit button, radio button group. how do I see if one of the radio button is checked and set it's value to a variable ?
[05:31:15] <Falbala> ramsub08: with a click event and an if clause with $('#checkboxID').is(':checked')
[05:33:38] <ramsub08> Falbala: something like this   $("#form-id").submit(function(){  ?
[05:34:11] <Falbala> if you want to check it on submit then this would work
[05:36:13] <ramsub08> Falbala: my case is, I;ve an URL in which this form is present. I send a POST request to that URL and my form has method=post. The post data will contain the radio button's value.
[05:36:52] <ramsub08> Falbala: My question here is, will the form be submitted upon POST request ? i.e will the $("#form-id").submit(function(){ ..}); be called upon the POST request ?
[05:37:54] <Falbala> don't know exactly but submit should be submit. Just try it
[05:38:05] <Falbala> or maybe someone here knows for sure
[05:39:08] <ramsub08> what the page will recieve is just a POST request and the HTML attribute of my form is set to POST. which means that POST request should check either of the radio button right ?
[05:50:37] <Mark_2> it loads ajax contents when i click on the ‘board’, but is there anyway i can add right to sliding animation?  can anyone help? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/
[05:55:52] <Mark_2> when i click on the ‘board’, it loads ajax contents after 3 seconds of noshow. can anyone spot the problematic code? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/
[06:45:56] <silverdust> Hi! I'm trying to access a variable from a callback in the global scope. How can I go about this?
[07:09:23] <silverdust> Any help on this?
[07:14:04] <silverdust> ping!!
[07:23:16] <gambl0re> is 2012 jquery old stuff?
[07:27:15] <decx> it belongs in a museum
[07:32:03] <gambl0re> anyone know good sites/books to learn jquery?
[07:41:27] <Whirled> could someone help me to normalize and sanitize this table: http://whirledorder.com/temp/inventory.htm
[07:41:42] <Whirled> it's the wrost markup I could imagine.
[07:42:38] <Whirled> I am this close: http://whirledorder.com/temp/test6.html
[07:57:59] <Whirled> So, I guess I am running into that thing where the last value in a loop is persisting, but I can't figure it out.
[08:23:14] <shoky> Whirled: in line 944 you're using i instead of j, i think
[08:23:21] <shoky> man, stop using for loops
[08:24:00] <shoky> Whirled: oh oops didn't see the inner for loop with i there, nevermind
[08:29:04] <decx> line 944?
[08:29:13] <decx> well i know what i'm not looking at
[08:29:16] <repxl> can anyone pls say me why my cookie value is allways 1000 when i restart the browser without cache cleaning ? http://pastebin.com/8uqvTcS3
[08:29:54] <repxl> it should be 1600 only when i clear cache it will be 1000 again
[08:30:59] <shoky> Whirled: llama/llama  :)
[08:31:10] <shoky> Whirled: er, llama/lamma ;)
[08:31:15] <repxl> i tought cookie values stay after u restart browser
[08:31:37] <shoky> Whirled: lines 942, 945
[08:34:52] <drej> repxl: there are different types of cookies
[08:35:11] <drej> persistent and sessionb ased cookies for starters
[08:35:17] <drej> and the persistent ones always have expiry time
[08:35:51] <repxl> drej hmm so i need change what ?
[08:36:00] <drej> your knowledge of cookies needs to change
[08:36:07] <drej> i dont know what youre trying to accomplish
[08:36:14] <drej> so im not sure what to tell you
[08:36:16] <drej> and im about to step out
[08:37:09] <repxl> drej i doing a "cookie usage warn box" when they close it it should be closed for more than just a browser close.
[08:39:19] <drej> http://cookiecuttr.com/
[08:39:23] <drej> why re-invent the wheel?
[08:39:39] <drej> http://www.primebox.co.uk/projects/jquery-cookiebar/
[08:39:40] <drej> etc
[08:39:53] <decx> i'm wary of any site that has "click here for the wordpress plugin" as cta
[08:49:24] <Whirled> shoky, you rock. That helps a lot.
[08:49:48] <Whirled> Now I have to go back to my regular expressions from hell to find a couple of errors there. Ugg...
[08:50:05] <shoky> sounds yummy
[08:50:08] <Whirled> I started with http://whirledorder.com/inventory.htm
[08:50:39] <Whirled> export from a paragon database that is the worst markup I could imagine, really.
[08:51:28] <Whirled> So I used regular expressions to parse the lines and identified each field by it's left:___px value...lol
[08:51:42] <decx> good lord
[08:52:07] <Whirled> I like to think of it as good old #css browbeating someone into not using tables for layout
[08:52:12] <Whirled> but could be anything.
[08:52:24] <decx> well you're out of date
[08:52:30] <decx> using tables is the new meta
[08:52:41] <Whirled> lol, I blinked
[09:28:45] <ramsub08> hello guys, I've a pair of radio button text fields, blabla.. belonging to a form and the radio button is inside a list. I'm getting all the form elements and excluding the radio button. I get the list of  form element using  $('#form-id').find(); and want to exclude the radio button using .not(); what should I have inside .not() ?
[09:31:40] <shoky> .not("[type=radio]")
[09:37:10] <ramsub08> shoky: that's inside a list. will this still work ?
[09:38:59] <shoky> donno what list you mean
[09:39:56] <ramsub08> <li>
[09:40:00] <ramsub08> shoky:
[09:40:18] <ramsub08> shoky: something like
[09:40:18] <ramsub08> <ul>
[09:40:18] <ramsub08>   <li><input type='radio' name='...'></li>
[09:40:53] <shoky> and what did you put in  .find(...) ?
[09:42:40] <shoky> best if you make a jsfiddle
[09:54:47] <ramsub08> shoky: ok, will make one
[10:32:28] <gambl0re> why is it necessary to use $(this) when traversing the dom, instead of just directly pointing to your object?
[10:33:13] <SirLagz> gambl0re: what do you mean directly pointing to your object?
[10:33:47] <gambl0re> what i mean..
[10:35:51] <gambl0re> instead of doing $(this).parent.find("div").children("li")....cant i just do $(div).children("li")
[10:36:54] <SirLagz> gambl0re: well if you know what $(div) is, sure. $('#divid').children() etc
[10:38:05] <gambl0re> but i see a lot of examples using $(this). then it becomes $(this).parent.find(".something").next().children().sibling.
[10:38:25] <gambl0re> why dont they just target whatever element they want to target from the beginning.
[10:38:50] <SirLagz> gambl0re: if the DOM is built dynamically then you can't.
[10:39:09] <SirLagz> gambl0re: for myself, I don't build complex websites, so I just target the element directly
[10:39:43] <gambl0re> so you dont use $(this)?
[10:40:01] <SirLagz> gambl0re: rarely
[10:40:38] <SirLagz> gambl0re: but then again, the websites I build are very simple dashboards generally
[10:41:03] <gambl0re> ok i thought it was best practice or something to always use $(this) while traversing. ok thanks.
[10:41:42] <SirLagz> gambl0re: I don't know if it is best practice or not, so don't take my word for it lol
[10:42:17] <gambl0re> ok well atleast i'll know im not the only one not using $(this).
[10:43:38] <SirLagz> gambl0re: indeed
[10:45:14] <rgraphix> gamble0re:fwiw I only use $(this) when the previous selector is dynamic. or if I am creating a plugin.
[11:37:54] <gambl0re> whats the difference between .bind(), .live(), delegate(), .on()
[11:38:15] <rindolf> Hi all.
[11:38:28] <Mr21> gambl0re: The deprecation ^^
[11:38:37] <Mr21> rindolf: Hi :)
[11:38:47] <gambl0re> the what?
[11:40:01] <Mr21> gambl0re: here: http://api.jquery.com/bind/ you can read: "As of jQuery 1.7, the .on() method is the preferred method for attaching event handlers to a document."
[11:40:36] <d[10]> http://pastebin.com/xSdyMN1h why .addClass does not work ?
[11:40:50] <gambl0re> but the other still work, so i can choose which one i want to use?
[11:41:11] <Mr21> gambl0re: hmmm no, use .on() every time
[11:41:31] <Mr21> gambl0re: .on or some alias like .click(), .submit(), etc
[11:41:53] <gambl0re> fine..
[11:42:17] <Mr21> But .on have some optionnal parameters, maybe you have to read all the doc, but, you can forget bind/live/delegate :) more simple ^^
[11:42:25] <Uhkis> just use on() for everything
[11:42:34] <d[10]> http://pastebin.com/xSdyMN1h why .addClass does not work ?
[11:43:14] <Mr21> d[10]: because your jquery object is empty at the moment you call .addClass
[11:43:50] <Mr21> d[10]: you have to learn how to debug.
[11:44:40] <d[10]> Mr21: why empty?
[11:44:43] <d[10]> o.O
[11:47:17] <Mr21> d[10]: if you write: $("#alskdjlajdlaskdlajs").addClass("xxx"); you will receive no error, but this code will do nothing, because jquery didnt find anything with this #id.
[11:47:57] <d[10]> Mr21: hum, true. Thanks!
[11:48:28] <Mr21> d[10]: if your fadeIn work, your addClass will work also, it's linked :)
[11:49:23] <rindolf> Mr21: what's new?
[11:50:31] <d[10]> Mr21:  my fadeIn work good, but .addClass no...
[11:51:24] <rcyr> d[10]: addClass is executed... but probably not at the moment you expect
[11:51:36] <Mr21> d[10]: it's not possible, if you open your debug console, you will see the class in the class="" attribute
[11:51:57] <d[10]> i will see the css...errors!
[11:52:10] <rcyr> d[10]: So, if you want to add the class _AFTER_ the fadeIn, it won't work the way you did it.
[11:52:35] <rcyr> d[10]: If you want that effect, you will need to use the fadeIn callback argument.
[11:55:31] <Mr21> rcyr: for that specific case, we use .delay() for that
[11:56:13] <rcyr> How would that help? He needs to use the second argument of fadeIn which is the callback that is called when fadeIn is finished.
[11:56:14] <Mr21> *we can use
[11:56:29] <rcyr> delay only exists to add a delay to the animation queue.
[11:56:45] <rcyr> If you're not dealing with animations, delay is useless.
[11:56:54] <rcyr> (There's an exception though..)
[11:57:01] <d[10]> rcyr: example ? ( [15:51] <rcyr> d[10]: If you want that effect, you will need to use the fadeIn callback argument.)
[11:57:16] <Mr21> rcyr: like this: $().fadeIn().delay().addClass();
[11:57:25] <rcyr> Mr21: That doesn't work.
[11:57:36] <rcyr> foo.fadeIn('slow', function() { $(this).addClass('navbuttonnew'); });
[11:57:46] <rcyr> d[10] ^
[11:57:48] <Mr21> rcyr: oh yeah? this doesnt work?
[11:58:14] <rcyr> Mr21: delay only works with things on the animation queue, addClass doesn't work with the animation queue
[11:58:37] <rcyr> So the addClass would be executed before the fadeIn and delay are done.
[11:59:16] <Mr21> right.. I read the doc too fast, rcyr is right
[11:59:20] <rcyr> Mr21: You could also do it with the promise interface if you want
[11:59:46] <rcyr> foo.fadeIn('slow').promise().done(function() { foo.addClass('newnavbutton'); });
[12:00:34] <d[10]> [15:56] <rcyr> foo.fadeIn('slow', function() { $(this).addClass('navbuttonnew'); });
[12:00:35] <d[10]> not work
[12:00:53] * gtristan learns that $(textareaElement).val('Some text') does not work on a textarea element that is not yet appended to the DOM and visible
[12:01:05] <d[10]> $('.navbutton li').fadeIn('slow', function(){ $this.addClass('navbuttonnew'); });
[12:01:06] <gtristan> is that a fact or am I missing something, some buggy behavior ?
[12:01:48] <Uhkis> d[10]: $(this) not $this
[12:01:48] <Mr21> gtristan: textarea doesnt use a value="" attribute
[12:02:14] <Mr21> gtristan: try .text() instead
[12:02:26] <d[10]> Uhkis: not work
[12:02:33] <gtristan> Mr21, aha, I'll try that...
[12:02:39] <d[10]> $('.navbutton li').fadeIn('slow', function(){ $(this).addClass('navbuttonnew'); });
[12:02:40] <rcyr> d[10]: Make an actual testcase on jsfiddle... else we can't do more.
[12:06:53] <gtristan> Mr21, very odd... it seems that using .text('some text') works to reliably set the textarea content... but then: value = $(element).text(); does not work reliably to fetch the text
[12:07:54] <Mr21> gtristan: ah? I will see
[12:08:34] <gtristan> yeah, oddly, .text() works great to set... and then .val() is fine to fetch the value from the editor at commit time
[12:09:16] <gtristan> I have 1.11.1 which might be a bit out of date though ;-)
[12:09:44] * gtristan had to backport some fixes regarding the pointer location in drag events
[12:17:25] <waspinator> how would I target a <div id="test"> that's inside an html string? For example one generated from $('#test').html()
[12:17:27] <Mr21> gtristan: I tested, and it's work fine. $("textarea").text("xxx"); alert($("textarea").text()); // xxx
[12:17:52] <Mr21> waspinator: with using .find() or .children()
[12:18:18] <Mr21> waspinator: $().html().find("#xxx")
[12:18:27] <waspinator> thanks Mr21
[12:18:49] <Mr21> :)
[12:19:17] <gtristan> yeah, perhaps it's got to do with the bootstrap css
[12:36:45] <waspinator> I'm having trouble selecting a child. any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/waspinator/ofh51bcg/1/
[12:49:29] <Mr21> waspinator: because .find() search in the children and small-children
[12:50:06] <Mr21> waspinator: your ID is on the container directly, not on another element inside your container
[12:51:53] <waspinator> Mr21, hmm, so how would I select #metaData > #one?
[12:52:25] <Mr21> waspinator: #metaData IS directly your $(data)
[12:52:55] <Mr21> waspinator: if you use is("#metaData") its will work
[12:53:17] <Mr21> (only for understand, you dont need .is here)
[12:55:33] <waspinator> Mr21, would I be able to target #another here? http://jsfiddle.net/waspinator/ofh51bcg/2/
[12:56:35] <Mr21> waspinator: another what?
[12:56:51] <waspinator> it's just a id name i chose
[12:56:56] <waspinator> in the fiddle
[12:57:05] <waspinator> it's a sibling of metaData
[12:58:27] <Mr21> waspinator: for understand your first problem with find(), it's like in real life, you can imagine something like this: $(ROOM).find(BED) right? now do you think this will work: $(ROOM).find(ROOM) ?
[13:00:26] <waspinator> Mr21, okay I think I get that. but what happens when ROOM has a sibling rather than a child. can you select it?
[13:00:32] <waspinator> http://jsfiddle.net/waspinator/ofh51bcg/2/
[13:01:34] <Mr21> waspinator: you cannot do $(ROOMS).find(ANYROOM), I think you have to use .filter() method
[13:05:46] <waspinator> Mr21. got it working with $(data).siblings.eq(1). would be nice to find siblings by id rather than index, but this is good enough for now. http://jsfiddle.net/waspinator/ofh51bcg/3/
[13:05:48] <waspinator> thanks
[13:07:30] <decx> what a weird concoction
[13:07:36] <Mr21> waspinator: oh yeah, you can use .eq(N) for catch the Nieme element of a jquery object but, if you want to use some id, class or whatever, for this specific case, I think you have to use .filter(), but here, maybe .eq is cool
[13:07:47] <waspinator> and found it http://jsfiddle.net/waspinator/ofh51bcg/4/
[13:08:28] <decx> dont use siblings
[13:08:31] <decx> use filter
[13:08:32] <waspinator> .siblings('[id=test]')
[13:08:53] <decx> data is 2 top level objects
[13:09:09] <decx> ie $(data).eq(1) would be your another div
[13:09:41] <waspinator> .filter('[id=another]') works too
[13:10:40] <Mr21> waspinator: [id=another] === #another
[13:11:25] <waspinator> d'oh
[13:38:43] <ramsub08> hello guys, i have a JQuery similar to this, $.post('URL', dict, process_histo_svg); what is the first parameter of process_histo_svg ?
[13:40:05] <ramsub08> rather, what will be it's functionality ?
[13:46:17] <DietDrK> I have raw SVG code from a JSON response. I thought I'd simply be able to say                $('#SVG').html(json_x['SVG']); It only shows up the text. What am I doing wrong?
[13:46:46] <DietDrK> console.log(json_x['SVG'])); shows the code as I'd like it.
[13:47:30] <DietDrK> Oh. When I inspect the div it shows it all as being there, too.
[14:34:43] <Whirled> does anybody know how to get an "approximate" match when comparing strings? I am trying to populate an auto-suggest and want to have it like Google's "Did you mean...?'
[14:47:24] <Mr21> Whirled: it's a little complex i think, maybe you have to do some diff between the two string.. maybe I dont know
[14:54:23] <sillyslux> http://andrew.hedges.name/experiments/levenshtein/
[14:54:37] <Siphion> yeah levenshtein!
[14:57:04] <Mr21> its the same algo I think (cf, the big of int)
[14:57:09] <Mr21> (but nice :))
[15:00:30] <DietDrK> How should I be uploading this SVG so that the selectors on line 59 work? SVG included
[15:01:02] <DietDrK> Dynamically added SVG from AJAX: http://pastebin.com/Qvf5HBzA
[15:02:15] <DietDrK> maybe I should be injecting the SVG into the page with something other than .html(SVG) ?
[15:06:17] <rcyr> DietDrK: http://jsfiddle.net/oohu63rk/ ?
[15:10:24] <rcyr> DietDrK: As for you event handlers, the elements they refer to simply don't exist at the point where they're called
[15:17:13] <DietDrK> how can I reload them?
[15:17:55] <DietDrK> Thanks for showing me a nice way of showing others in jsfiddle btw
[15:20:18] <DietDrK> ahh. all of my functions are wrapped in a $(document).ready(function () { ... });. So perhaps that's why they're not working
[15:20:26] <rcyr> DietDrK: http://jsfiddle.net/oohu63rk/1/
[15:20:35] <rcyr> DietDrK: Nah, it's related to document.ready
[15:20:42] <rcyr> Looks at my example
[15:21:10] <DietDrK> I just made this: http://jsfiddle.net/sfa33cow/
[15:23:15] <DietDrK> so if I replaced all of my $('selector').click( function(){}); with $(document.body).on('click,'selector',function(){}); it might work?
[15:23:18] <rcyr> It works in this test, won't work for yours.
[15:23:32] <rcyr> The latter will work
[15:23:52] <DietDrK> I heard that using ".on" was a bad thing
[15:23:58] <rcyr> No, it's the only thing to use.
[15:24:00] <DietDrK> or maybe that was using functions in HTML
[15:24:06] <DietDrK> Let me give it a shot, then
[15:24:18] <rcyr> You should consider everything but .on deprecated.
[15:24:45] <DietDrK> It works
[15:24:52] <DietDrK> .on is a JQuery construct, right?
[15:25:04] <rcyr> Normal event handling: node.on(eventName, handler);       Delegated event handling: parentElement.on(eventName, selector, handler);
[15:25:26] <rcyr> Delegated event handlers have the advantage of working with elements that are added "later"
[15:26:02] <DietDrK> This topic is called something like 'dynamic dom' and events?
[15:26:49] <rcyr> It's about event propagation
[15:26:59] <rcyr> Have you heard of something called "event bubbling"?
[15:28:34] <DietDrK> I haven't but I'd be happy to look it up
[15:28:34] <rcyr> Basically, when you click on an element. The "click" handler will be called on the click element and ALL its parents/grandparents until the root node is reached
[15:28:34] <DietDrK> found it http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/events
[15:28:34] <DietDrK> .click is an alias for this $(document.body).on('click','selector','function...'); ?
[15:28:34] <rcyr> No
[15:28:41] <rcyr> .click is an alias for .on('click', handler)
[15:29:44] <rcyr> DietDrK: Look at the Event Bubbling and Event Delegation paragraphs on the llink you pasted
[15:30:47] <DietDrK> found a chapter in my book: JavaScript & Jquery: The Missing Manual. "Advanced Event Management"
[15:32:01] <DietDrK> I feel a little bit like .on() is similar to PHP's eval(). Is .on() looked down upon?
[15:32:44] <rcyr> No... .on does both normal and delegated event listeners... it's the "ONLY" function that you should use.
[15:32:48] <Siphion> nope
[15:33:15] <rcyr> Everything else is old stuff(.bind/.delegate/etc) and shortcuts (.click/.change/etc)
[15:33:42] <rcyr> And those shortcuts call... .on
[15:34:08] <DietDrK> I think those are called 'event listeners'. Is there a better practice for using 'functions' like .hide()?
[15:35:28] <rcyr> DietDrK: Adding/remove a class
[15:35:41] <DietDrK> I mean the 'verbs'
[15:35:51] <rcyr> No, not really
[15:36:46] <rcyr> DietDrK: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/0705be475092aede1eddae01319ec931fb9c65fc/src/event/alias.js
[15:37:09] <DietDrK> This might be considered ok practice: http://pastebin.com/LZDpbaZx ?
[15:37:49] <DietDrK> and if the order of the clicks were important, I could keep variables just under the 1st line?
[15:37:57] <rcyr> Yes, but you don't necessarily need document.body to be the target. It only needs to be a parent that is present when you apply the listener.
[15:38:08] <rcyr> order of the clicks?
[15:38:35] <DietDrK> if I click button 1 first, I should remember the node's ID. Then the second click will send the ordered pair to api.php
[15:39:52] <rcyr> DietDrK: Just use a variable under the first line
[15:41:28] <DietDrK> This is what I'm working towards: http://pastebin.com/3EKAMnvu
[15:43:24] <rcyr> In your code ID is not declared so it's a global, don't do that.
[15:43:32] <rcyr> Beside that issue, it should work.
[15:43:41] <DietDrK> rcyr: Really, thanks so much.
[15:43:49] <rcyr> You're welcome :)
[16:14:40] <ChrisBinge> hey, think you guys coul check out my question on SO? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30552263/make-text-size-adjust-to-fit-text-in-entire-container
[17:08:59] <Dexx1_> I am trying to simply show a "notification" when my website loads, can someone help? http://jsfiddle.net/93keyfm6/
[17:09:11] <Dexx1_> (using NOTY)
[17:16:27] <Mr21> Dexx1_: what is the pb?
[17:16:52] <Mr21> Dexx1_: btw you can use the shortcut: $(function() { ... }); instead of $(document).ready(function() { ... })
[17:17:39] <Dexx1_> Mr21: whats pb?
[17:19:00] <Docan> Hey got an interesting jquery question. If i capture all AjaxComplete requests from the page and i want the id of element from the document that fired it. AKA img tag that is trying to request data how would i grab that element to modify it?
[17:19:13] <Docan> active element and delegated element always document
[17:19:30] <Docan> how does the get request know where the data will be applied to on the page
[17:21:04] <Docan> looking to capture any img requests for svg, take that responseText and replace the element that fired the request with in lined svg. This way i can apply external css to every svg on the page :) and only 1 get request
[17:30:04] <Mr21> Dexx1_: *problem sorry
[17:32:05] <Dexx1_> Mr21: works ok: http://jsfiddle.net/93keyfm6/1/ -- but I'd like to change the font and background color if possible
[17:33:50] <Mr21> Dexx1_: sorry, I have no idea, it's not about jquery itself :/
[17:34:10] <Dexx1_> Mr21: ok ok
[17:35:32] <Docan> anyone know how the document knows what element triggered an event on it
[17:36:44] <sillyslux> event.target?
[17:37:07] <Docan> that just points to the document
[17:37:36] <sillyslux> sry
[18:26:15] <Docan> meh think i headed down wrong patch
[18:26:25] <Docan> dont think you can capture dom request in js
[18:26:38] <Docan> need to modifiy dom element before it hits page somehow
[18:26:42] <Docan> path*
[18:35:38] <Dexx1_> So I have a tumblr blog and it's very slow b/c it loads a lot of crap. I was wondering if anyone is able to look at the site and tell me if I could comment out/remove certain libraries/js from loading to make the site fast.
[18:37:25] <rcyr> What's the url?
[18:38:58] <tw2113> does tumblr allow that much control?
[18:51:58] <Dexx1_> So right now I am running something when my website loads: $( document ).ready(function() { ... }); ---- how can I make sure that this only loads ONCE per user? I.e: I don't want it to run every time someone clicks through internal links or refreshes the page.
[18:59:54] <tw2113> yeah, that's not how that code works
[19:00:31] <arc_> o_O
[19:01:03] <arc_> Dexx1_ what are you actually trying to do
[19:01:21] <tw2113> optimize his tumblr
[19:04:49] <Dexx1_> arc_: lines 3 & 17: http://jsfiddle.net/93keyfm6/4/ ---- doesn't feel right. If a user visits the site, I only want to run that code once every 3 days
[19:05:22] <tw2113> ok that makes a bit more sense
[19:05:33] <tw2113> inside the .ready(), which will run every page load
[19:05:38] <tw2113> you check for a cookie for the user
[19:05:48] <tw2113> and THAT part is only supposed to run every 3 days
[19:12:47] <Dexx1_> tw2113: k, running it live on my site: http://talkingholes.com --- not working. The cookie is not being set for some reason. ideas?
[19:13:59] <tw2113> checked your browser console?
[19:15:55] <Dexx1_> tw2113: yea, nothing. this is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/93keyfm6/5/
[19:16:32] <tw2113> in cases of if statements, i tend to do different console.logs to see which portion gets run each time
[19:17:09] <tw2113> at least then, you know which half is failing
[19:24:10] <Dexx1_> tw2113: http://jsfiddle.net/93keyfm6/6/ -- codes broken
[19:24:58] <tw2113> because you ty to set the cookie inside the object you're creating for animation
[19:25:20] <tw2113> and inside the object you're passing to noty
[19:44:13] <Dexx1_> tw2113: is this correct? http://jsfiddle.net/93keyfm6/8/
[19:44:41] <tw2113> not as far as i can see
[19:45:09] <tw2113> from everything I've ever seen with jQuery/js, you'd want to move lines 18-21 to at least after line 25
[19:49:14] <Dexx1_> tw2113: yea, you are right. works ok I think. What's the explanation again? set the cookie after the animation right?
[19:50:02] <Dexx1_> tw2113: also, so this is only going to run once every 3 days at maximum right?
[19:50:41] <tw2113> you were trying to run the cookie setting inside the parameters being pased into noty()
[19:50:48] <tw2113> which isn't the time to be doing that
[19:51:04] <tw2113> i told you to move it to after the execution of the noty() function
[19:51:12] <tw2113> and set the cookie at that point
[19:51:37] <Dexx1_> oh ok. great. thanks
[19:51:41] <tw2113> i assume line 5 will return false for 3 days
[19:52:09] <Dexx1_> tw2113: oh ok
[20:17:24] <Whirled> how would you select all of the divs with no borders between divs with 1px borders...not children, but siblings...
[20:19:15] <Whirled> or actually, better yet. How would you parse this terrible terrible html file into records? http:.//whirledorder.com/temp/inventory.htm
[20:26:03] <kevireilly> Whirled: ouchies
[20:28:13] <Whirled> tell me about it. It sucks.
[20:30:35] <arc_> not entirely sure that's possible
[20:30:37] <kevireilly> Whirled: the `top` can maybe be used
[20:32:32] <Whirled> I came really close to getting it worked out using regular expressions and filtering the html based on left: value
[20:34:04] <Whirled> ^(.*left: 63px.*>(.*)$     would give me the value and I'd replace it with "ll_title"="$1",
[20:34:05] <arc_> this is possibly the dumbest thing i've ever seen
[20:34:14] <arc_> how was this even made
[20:34:23] <kevireilly> Gnostice eDocEngine
[20:34:46] <Whirled> it comes out of an old paradox database that is encrypted so I can't get into the tables
[20:35:00] <arc_> well, whoever wrote that software needs to find another job
[20:35:19] <Whirled> They have. Leaving about 60% of the Llama owners in a total bind.
[20:35:22] <kevireilly> it is almost as if it was intentionally made to be difficult to easily parse :)
[20:35:31] <Whirled> undoubtedly.
[20:35:51] <Whirled> They are completely evil.
[20:36:22] <nopea> I am getting an error Cannot read property 'scroll' of null when using this jquery code.... http://pastebin.com/u1kCBKpG  any ideas as to why?
[20:36:47] <arc_> it seems like everything is in the same order every time. is there an inconsistent number of fields?
[20:37:06] <Whirled> yes.
[20:37:19] <Whirled> AND, there are all kinds of messy characters in the names
[20:37:30] <arc_> sounds like you're fucked without ocr
[20:37:35] <Whirled> names like 'n my dreams or des'ree
[20:37:41] <Whirled> It does worse in OCR
[20:37:55] <kevireilly> nopea: does the erro point to line 1 (or whichever line it equates to in the actual code)? suggests you don’t have access to `window`
[20:38:15] <arc_> i mean a program that uses ocr but is specifically written to parse this :p
[20:39:00] <nopea> kevireilly: chrome is not telling me which line.... but I am sure it is withing that section of code (I pasted on pastebin)
[20:39:01] <Whirled> nopea, are you enclosing your script in a wrapper for document ready?
[20:39:45] <nopea> Whirled: I do not believe so
[20:41:07] <Whirled> Then is it possible this code is acting before the dom is ready? try putting $(document).ready(function () {   ===yourcode });
[20:44:16] <nopea> Whirled: just tried.... still the same
[20:46:07] <arc_> can you paste the page you are working on
[20:46:50] <nopea> Whirled: got it
[20:47:04] <nopea> wrapped it in jQuery(document).ready(function($)
[20:47:36] <arc_> btw i would use if scrolltop > document height - window height - some amount
[20:47:44] <arc_> so you don't have to scroll all the way to the absolute bottom pixel
[20:47:56] <nopea> I am not a big user of Jquery.... curious what would $(window) be in plain javascript?
[20:48:26] <nopea> arc_: yeah I am going to adjust to kick in when the top of the footer is reached
[20:48:31] <arc_> k
[20:50:00] <Mr21> nopea: $(window) there is no equivalent to plain JS, because here, you construct a jquery object.
[20:50:39] <Mr21> nopea: there is no equivalent to $(document.getElementById("id")) neither
[20:51:15] <nopea> Mr21: thanks.  I was just curious how this would be done in plain javascript (just cause I like to know) but everything I google points to Jquery
[20:51:57] <Mr21> Hmm yeap but, you cannot have plain js for this, if you really want to.. you have to copy all the jquery.js file.
[20:52:42] <Mr21> nopea: it's not like $("body").addClass("foo") --> document.body.className += "foo";
[20:53:06] <arc_> i think he's just asking about window.onscroll=function(){};
[20:53:15] <kevireilly> Whirled: perhaps something like node cheerio?
[20:53:50] <Mr21> arc_: oh ok, right
[20:53:53] <kevireilly> Whirled: guess that doesn’t really help anymore than jquery itself aside from it being server side and possibly easier to save extracted data
[20:53:57] <TeddyMurray> how do i get text only from a div? all the characters besides the tags
[20:54:09] <kevireilly> TeddyMurray: $(el).text();
[20:54:26] <TeddyMurray> really? cool thanks
