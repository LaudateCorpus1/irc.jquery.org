[00:01:16] <sacho_> there's only the few listed in animate
[00:01:33] <sacho_> I think there's a plugin with more easing options
[00:02:08] <Whirl3d_> http://css3.bradshawenterprises.com/sliding/
[00:03:44] <Whirl3d_> the easing.js plugin implements robbert penner's easing and there's every kind you can imageine
[00:03:56] <sacho_> yeah, easing.js.
[00:04:37] <Whirl3d_> plus, there's a link to an old as2 custom animation tool that helps you graphically develop a custom easing function that plugins in in the same way the easing.js (an all easing fx plugins) do
[00:05:57] <thomedy> i im looking at that first one right now....
[00:06:15] <thomedy> sorry im a bit distracted clicking back and forth on stuff so im back to the first one
[00:07:38] <mindis|wurk> anyone got tips on how to fix resizable elements changing position if a (grand)parent has been scrolled?
[00:08:45] <Whirl3d_> take your time. The log will keep these links handy for your whenver you want. don't worry about clicking back and forth. Here's another to distract you more...these were the winners for Mozilla's css3 animation derby: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/devderby/2012/march/
[00:09:18] <thomedy> well i have to look at that one dont i
[00:10:26] <thomedy> holy jesus that is awesome
[00:10:27] <thomedy> im on it
[00:18:45] <peiper> i get a parseerror when i load this content via ajax http://justpaste.it/12cs
[00:18:52] <thomedy> okay there is just a little bit of a  jump dang
[00:18:56] <peiper> SyntaxError: JSON.parse: expected double-quoted property name
[00:19:07] <peiper> can anyone quickly look over that?
[00:20:02] <fuchstronaut> (peiper): "Es ist ein Fehler aufgetreten, der Vorgang konnte nicht abgeschlossen werden.", <- remove the comma there
[00:20:03] <fuchstronaut> maybe
[00:20:17] <coldhead> peiper: http://jsonlint.com/
[00:20:58] <peiper> ahhh thanks fuchstronaut !
[00:21:17] <fuchstronaut> its just a guess, but thats usually where I fail
[00:21:36] <peiper> hmm still parseerror
[00:22:24] <fuchstronaut> theres a comma too much still
[00:22:33] <fuchstronaut> line 10
[00:22:39] <fuchstronaut> check it out on jsonlint.com
[00:22:44] <coldhead> if only there were a website that could validate your json instead of having humans try and guess the problem
[00:22:47] <fuchstronaut> nice tool, thanks coldhead
[00:22:50] <coldhead> :D
[00:23:13] <ravenzz> :d
[00:23:38] <peiper> now it works thanks fuchstronaut  !
[00:23:44] <IfSixWasNine> good mornin' kind folks
[00:23:58] <fuchstronaut> (peiper): credit for this goes to coldhead actually
[00:24:06] <fuchstronaut> IfSixWasNine good morning
[00:24:20] * coldhead np: the poster children - redline
[00:24:25] <IfSixWasNine> what a lovely day for a guiness ;)
[00:24:35] <fuchstronaut> yeah, it's 9:24 here
[00:24:37] <fuchstronaut> prefect time
[00:24:40] <coldhead> oh jealous
[00:24:58] <peiper> thanks coldhead :D
[00:27:33] <crazy_phone> hey guys
[00:27:36] <crazy_phone> anyone knows why
[00:27:43] <crazy_phone> when i write something like
[00:27:44] <crazy_phone> $.mobile.changePage("newPage.html?id=123");	
[00:27:49] <crazy_phone> it doesnt work
[00:27:55] <crazy_phone> and when i change it to
[00:27:58] <crazy_phone> $.mobile.changePage("newPage.html");	
[00:28:03] <crazy_phone> it works just fine
[00:28:07] <crazy_phone> any ideas ?
[00:28:47] <Cork> ?dnw
[00:28:48] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find "dnw" in jQuery Docs.
[00:29:18] <Cork> crazy_phone: "doesn't work"
[00:29:27] <peiper> crazy_phone, passing get parameters to an html?!
[00:29:45] <crazy_phone> there is javascript to handle the parameters there
[00:29:47] <Cork> peiper: just cause theres .html in the url doesn't mean its a plain html file
[00:30:03] <crazy_phone> the problem is that
[00:30:07] <diverdude> Cork: no?
[00:30:11] <crazy_phone> the changePage method doesnt work
[00:30:15] <peiper> yea you can tell the php intepreter to parse .html files but what sense should this make 0.o
[00:30:19] <diverdude> Cork: what else can there be? you mean js/css?
[00:30:45] <crazy_phone> what is the problem with sending url parameters to html ?
[00:30:47] <Cork> diverdude: nope, its VERY common, to have .html at the end of url rewritten links, just to make search engines happy
[00:30:51] <crazy_phone> id don`t understant
[00:30:59] <peiper> diverdude, u can even create ur own suffix its just webserver settings
[00:31:04] <Cork> diverdude: it can still be a server script at the backend
[00:31:20] <Cork> crazy_phone: no theres no problem
[00:31:24] <fuchstronaut> you guys think google will be fine indexing .boob files?
[00:31:29] <Cork> crazy_phone: but what happens
[00:31:38] <diverdude> why even have a suffix then?
[00:31:46] <diverdude> why not just avoid suffix
[00:31:48] <coldhead> i've seen worse indexed, fuchstronaut
[00:31:49] <Cork> diverdude: cause search engines want them
[00:31:57] <Cork> like i said
[00:31:58] <diverdude> Cork: what do you mean
[00:32:04] <fuchstronaut> great, I'm going to edit my apache config
[00:32:08] <Cork> ?g google.com @ diverdude
[00:32:08] <bot-t> diverdude, Google - http://www.google.com/
[00:32:11] * coldhead np: the poster children - blatant dis
[00:32:17] <Cork> search engine
[00:32:21] <diverdude> yeah i know
[00:32:33] <diverdude> but why does .html make google more happy
[00:32:38] <crazy_phone> Cork: what you think the problem is when cnahgePage even have and option to send parameters
[00:32:45] <crazy_phone> but it doesnt work either
[00:32:55] <Cork> diverdude: you get minus on your urls if its html content and not .html in the url
[00:33:02] <fuchstronaut> maybe searchengines like html because they assume its not dynamic
[00:33:05] <Cork> diverdude: ask them
[00:33:09] <peiper> fuchstronaut, uhhh apache suchs :D
[00:33:14] <peiper> k*
[00:33:22] <Cork> crazy_phone: you still haven't said what the problem is...
[00:33:34] <Cork> just "doesn't work"
[00:33:35] <crazy_phone> it says error loading page
[00:33:38] <crazy_phone> nothing else
[00:33:41] <peiper> crazy_phone, maybe u can put the source of ur method on a fiddle?
[00:33:45] <Cork> ok, now we'r getting somewhere
[00:33:51] <fuchstronaut> (peiper): whats better than apache?
[00:34:00] <fuchstronaut> i never had issues with apache
[00:34:04] <superchu> nginx
[00:34:05] <peiper> fuchstronaut, litespeed, nginx, etc.etc.etc.
[00:34:05] <Cork> crazy_phone: if you do a plain ajax call to the server with that url, does it work?
[00:34:08] <fuchstronaut> well... no not-selfmade
[00:34:09] <crazy_phone> peiper: there is nothing else just $.mobile.changePage("newPage.html?id=123");	
[00:34:17] <crazy_phone> if i do it like this
[00:34:18] <mindis|wurk> argh. damn resizable
[00:34:20] <crazy_phone> $.mobile.changePage("newPage.html");	
[00:34:24] <crazy_phone> it works great
[00:34:37] <crazy_phone> but with parameters it does not
[00:34:42] <crazy_phone> it is a phonegap app
[00:34:45] <crazy_phone> it is not a server
[00:34:49] <fuchstronaut> (crazy_phone): what happens when you access newPage.html?id=123 via your browser?
[00:35:00] <Cork> crazy_phone: what does $.get("newPage.html?id=123", function(data) { alert(data); }); do for you?
[00:35:12] <crazy_phone> i cannot access it in a browser its on a phone
[00:35:22] <crazy_phone> Cork: let me chek
[00:35:36] <Cork> crazy_phone: sure you can, just fake your ua
[00:35:59] <Cork> crazy_phone: but it sounds like a server error more then a script error
[00:35:59] <fuchstronaut> (crazy_phone): well, i guess changePage is not working because your server cant handle the get params
[00:36:07] * Cork nods
[00:36:09] <peiper> fuchstronaut, the problem is that apache is mainstream ^^ almsot every linux dist installs apache as default webserver lets say its the noob webserver which is installable with 1 click and configurable with 1 click if u really want max performance out of system that u should consider using advanced webservers like litespeed,nginx etc.
[00:36:51] <fuchstronaut> (peiper): oh, thats true, we had one project using some kinky perlwritten httpd
[00:37:02] <fuchstronaut> but all-in-all im happy with apache
[00:37:16] <peiper> fuchstronaut, for a small local dev server its okay
[00:37:21] <crazy_phone> Cork: $.get("newPage.html?id=123", function(data) { alert(data); }); gives the same error
[00:37:33] <crazy_phone> the console says
[00:37:34] <Cork> crazy_phone: so its a server error then
[00:37:35] <peiper> fuchstronaut, on a production live system i would not use apache
[00:37:51] <crazy_phone> uknown chromium error: -6
[00:37:53] <Cork> crazy_phone: the server can't handle query strings
[00:37:55] <crazy_phone> go figure
[00:38:02] <fuchstronaut> (peiper): I've been using apache for some projects, no problems there, but it was set up by someone who really knows the admin-dance
[00:38:19] <crazy_phone> Cork: so how i make it work on the damn phone ?
[00:38:22] <peiper> fuchstronaut, because he's fucking lazy ^^
[00:38:22] <crazy_phone> any ideas ?
[00:38:31] <Cork> crazy_phone: remove the query string
[00:38:41] <Cork> no other option
[00:38:43] <peiper> fuchstronaut, or got lots of ressources and dont mind
[00:38:55] <crazy_phone> but how do i pass data to the page then ?
[00:39:03] <Cork> crazy_phone: cookie?
[00:39:06] <Cork> donno
[00:39:14] <peiper> or session data if its php
[00:39:17] <fuchstronaut> (peiper): yeah, the ressources are really awesome, maybe thats why ;)
[00:39:25] <crazy_phone> Cork: thanx for the help anyway :)
[00:39:28] <Cork> your kinda screwed, as the server is broken
[00:39:38] <crazy_phone> bu its a damn phone
[00:39:46] <crazy_phone> why it couldnt handle a simple url parameter
[00:39:49] <crazy_phone> this is retarded
[00:39:56] <Cork> crazy_phone: you mean your trying to do in on file:// ??
[00:40:28] <Cork> if so then ya, that doesn't surprise me
[00:40:39] <fuchstronaut> i think he is accessing some kind of smartphone api there
[00:40:45] <Cork> crazy_phone:  you need a webserver to handle the query string
[00:40:46] <fuchstronaut> which, as it looks, doesnt support url params
[00:41:00] <thomedy> okay maybe maybe maybe ifixed it
[00:41:04] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[00:41:19] <thomedy> please someone look and see if they are getting any jumps on my slide transitions
[00:41:40] <Cork> crazy_phone: though if your doing it on a local system you could use ajax for everything and never replace the start url
[00:41:59] <Cork> crazy_phone: that way you don't need to pass the data, it could just live in the global scope
[00:42:19] <coldhead> hey matt
[00:42:34] <thomedy> nope i still have jumps what am i doing wrong
[00:42:40] <thomedy> is my js bulky
[00:42:56] <thomedy> should i efficientise my js more
[00:47:34] <bloof> are you doing any other processing at the same time of the transition
[00:47:38] <crazy_phone> Cork: sorry but my remote connection to the computer i was using for irc messed up
[00:47:45] <crazy_phone> can you repeat what you wrote last :D
[00:47:57] <Cork> crazy_phone: whats the last line you got?
[00:47:59] <crazy_phone> and all others who talked to me
[00:48:07] <crazy_phone> what you mean last line ?
[00:48:15] <Cork> the last line you saw
[00:48:33] <crazy_phone> that i am screwed
[00:48:36] <crazy_phone> :D
[00:48:37] <coldhead> http://irc.jquery.com/%23jquery/%23jquery_20120620.log.html
[00:48:46] <crazy_phone> and the server cannot handle urls with parameters
[00:48:47] <Cork> :)
[00:48:51] <Cork> coldhead++
[00:49:03] <crazy_phone> coolhead++
[00:49:07] <crazy_phone> big time :D
[00:49:26] <crazy_phone> so what do you mean trying to file://
[00:49:27] <crazy_phone> ?
[00:49:29] <crazy_phone> cork:
[00:49:57] <Cork> crazy_phone: do you know how protocols work?
[00:51:26] <coldhead> protocol is how like you shouldn't try to shake hands with the queen
[00:51:29] <coldhead> or pat her on the head
[00:51:34] <coldhead> and tell her she's doing a good job
[00:51:38] <Cork> lol
[00:51:42] <Cork> not really XD
[00:53:06] <crazy_phone> omg
[00:53:11] <crazy_phone> my connection crashed again
[00:53:19] <crazy_phone> what the hell is going on with technology today
[00:53:32] <crazy_phone> can the guy with the history link post it again
[00:53:38] <crazy_phone> please
[00:54:23] <crazy_phone> Cork: so you were saying ?
[00:54:37] <crazy_phone> i have basic protocol concept ideas
[00:54:43] <crazy_phone> but i am noob at all this
[00:55:40] <coldhead> http://irc.jquery.com/%23jquery/%23jquery_20120620.log.html
[00:56:03] <crazy_phone> coolhead: thanx so much :)
[00:56:12] <crazy_phone> how do you find this history ?
[00:56:51] <thomedy> dang it i m stumped
[00:57:09] <thomedy> i need this jerky animation to be not jerky and all the stuff im reading so far is no good
[00:57:25] <thomedy> like i cant set a static height i need auto
[00:57:29] <thomedy> i have no margins
[00:58:17] <thomedy> i dont want to sleep until i nail this animation
[00:59:03] <crazy_phone> some code might be helpfull
[00:59:07] <crazy_phone> to understand what you ask
[00:59:41] <Trisox> coldhead
[00:59:42] <caniuse> Trisox: coldhead: a brand new person to jQuery. Ignore at all costs!!!!!
[00:59:49] <raj> how can I count up in seconds?
[00:59:58] <raj> (and display it)
[01:00:18] <crazy_phone> what do you mean raj
[01:00:25] <raj> like a timer
[01:00:32] <raj> that's displayed to the user
[01:00:42] <Trisox> did you google that?
[01:00:46] <crazy_phone> raj
[01:00:49] <Trisox> i bet you didnt
[01:00:55] <crazy_phone> no he didnt
[01:01:03] <Trisox> so go google counter jquery  or something
[01:01:11] <raj> is jquery necessary?
[01:01:12] <crazy_phone> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_gettime.asp
[01:01:14] <crazy_phone> raj:
[01:01:16] <Trisox> no
[01:01:19] <Trisox> and no
[01:01:51] <raj> i see how I can use a timer
[01:01:55] <raj> but how can I display it?
[01:01:58] <raj> that's why I'm asking
[01:02:03] <crazy_phone> :|
[01:02:06] <crazy_phone> alert it
[01:02:14] <crazy_phone> or write it in a DOM element
[01:02:16] <crazy_phone> or whatever
[01:02:29] <crazy_phone> what are you trying to achieve
[01:02:33] <crazy_phone> ?
[01:02:41] <raj> but to update it
[01:02:53] <crazy_phone> on regular intervals ?
[01:03:13] <crazy_phone> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp
[01:03:23] <Trisox> nooooo :|

[01:04:01] <raj> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2604450/how-to-create-a-jquery-clock-timer
[01:04:02] <crazy_phone> what is b ad about it
[01:04:04] <raj> not very jqueryish
[01:04:11] <raj> is there a way to do it with delay maybe?
[01:04:15] <juha_> w3school is as cool as alert([object]);
[01:04:16] <raj> or should I just stick with this?
[01:04:37] <Trisox> :D
[01:04:40] <crazy_phone> ok next time i will post javascriptkit
[01:04:49] <crazy_phone> i hope you wount be offended then :D
[01:04:51] <Cork> raj: var now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)); var end = now + 30; alert(end - Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)))

[01:05:36] <Trisox> i know crazy_phone
[01:05:39] <crazy_phone> :D
[01:05:48] <Cork> raj: make sure you build your ticker from Date and not a variable
[01:06:05] <raj> Cork, meaning don't use start=new Date ?
[01:06:08] <Cork> raj: as timers isn't guaranteeing there speed
[01:06:12] <raj> like this shows http://stackoverflow.com/a/2604459/997624
[01:06:44] <Cork> raj: no meaning don't do time = 30; setInterval(function() { time--; alert(time); }, 1000);
[01:06:57] <Cork> cause that will break badly
[01:07:14] <raj> for real?
[01:07:17] <raj> what's wrong with that?
[01:07:33] <Cork> it your clock will not step in seconds
[01:07:44] <Cork> it will step in secondish terms
[01:08:04] <Cork> the timer is called when the computer has time to call it
[01:08:23] <Cork> and when the tab isn't the front one, the timer cycle is lowered
[01:08:27] <raj> if the variable is outside the setInterval function?
[01:08:33] <Cork> so never count on timers to be precise
[01:08:44] <Cork> raj: the variable doesn't really matter
[01:08:51] <Cork> just never do something--
[01:08:58] <raj> oh
[01:08:59] <Cork> build it from the current date
[01:09:11] <raj> I just did exactly what that SO post showed
[01:09:23] <raj> along with your Math.floor
[01:09:31] <Cork> ya, that works
[01:09:40] <raj> but you're saying this timer is not reliable?
[01:09:51] <Cork> never said anything about that page
[01:10:33] <Cork> i just said that timer events isn't reliable so you always need to verify them
[01:10:46] <crazy_phone> or try to build it with requestAnimationFrame
[01:10:49] <crazy_phone> and be a real pro :D
[01:11:02] <Cork> ya, thats actually even better
[01:11:16] <crazy_phone> but them it will be a bit more coplex
[01:11:18] <Cork> then you won't process anything unless you actually need to draw it
[01:11:22] <Cork> not really
[01:11:40] <crazy_phone> just a little tiny bit because of browser compatipability
[01:11:40] <Cork> just replace setInterval with the requestAnimationFrame
[01:11:41] <raj> no idea what that means
[01:11:48] <raj> you're saying I can get a reliable counter?
[01:11:51] <Cork> ?mdc requestAnimationFrame @ raj
[01:11:55] <bot-t> raj, window.requestAnimationFrame - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Tells the browser that you wish to perform an animation; this requests that the browser schedule a repaint of the window for the next animation frame.  The method takes as an argument a callback to... https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.requestAnimationFrame
[01:12:18] <Cork> raj: no not at all
[01:12:26] <raj> oh
[01:12:28] <crazy_phone> requestAnimationFrame is the future so try and learn to use it
[01:12:32] <raj> then what's the point?
[01:12:33] <Cork> its a callback system thats only called when you actually need it
[01:12:37] <crazy_phone> setInterval is so 2009
[01:12:37] <Cork> instead for on a timer
[01:12:47] <Cork> uh.. not really
[01:13:06] <Cork> its a completely different structure then setInterval
[01:13:21] <Cork> setInterval is called on a proximatly timer interval
[01:13:34] <Cork> requestAnimationFrame is called when the browser needs to redraw the page
[01:13:35] <crazy_phone> i made a canvas game useing setInterval and it was laggin as crap  rewrote with animationframe
[01:13:39] <crazy_phone> worked like a charm :D
[01:13:44] <Cork> so when the page doesn't need to be redrawn its not called
[01:13:53] <crazy_phone> for example
[01:13:56] <crazy_phone> if the page
[01:13:59] <crazy_phone> is on background
[01:14:04] <crazy_phone> it wount call javascript
[01:14:06] <crazy_phone> on regular intervals
[01:14:11] <crazy_phone> and this will save cpu time
[01:14:15] <Cork> yup, cause its called when its needed, and not just on an interval
[01:14:38] <Cork> do less, do it when its needed
[01:14:41] <crazy_phone> and when the window is on focus again it will go full power
[01:14:44] <Cork> double gains
[01:14:58] <crazy_phone> and if you CPU is overloaded
[01:15:03] <crazy_phone> it will try to adjust
[01:15:08] <Cork> not really
[01:15:12] <crazy_phone> and probably save you from javascript crash
[01:15:26] <crazy_phone> this is what i observed
[01:15:27] <Cork> the adjustment comes from the fact that its called when the browser does the next redraw
[01:15:56] <Cork> so if the cpu is overloaded, it takes longer before the browser can do the next redraw, and thereby...
[01:15:57] <crazy_phone> Cork: is probably right i am talking from personal observations only
[01:16:19] <Cork> crazy_phone: the effect is correct, but the reason is wrong
[01:17:11] <Cork> this is closer to a dom ready/ click event system then setInterval
[01:17:39] <Cork> but the syntax is intentionally made to be able to be a drop in replacement for setInterval
[01:20:11] <raj> ok, I'm  not sure how to accomplish this, theoretically. I'd like for everytime Start is clicked, the timer1 is reset to 0 and counted up again (timer2 should only start counting the first time Start is pressed) http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/n7qvK/
[01:20:20] <raj> essentially I'm not sure how to cancel the previous setInterval function
[01:23:21] <thomedy> okay its not frame rate its not easin
[01:23:27] <thomedy> i really could use some help
[01:23:36] <thomedy>  because  i need thsi to be smoother
[01:23:49] <thomedy> right now i have the frame rate set to 20 fps
[01:24:02] <thomedy> instead of the 77 usualll im still gettin it
[01:24:46] <steveccc> if i have a javascript variable I want to use with the append function then do I need a $ or just put the var name in () ie .append(varname);
[01:25:34] <raj> steveccc, $('#target').append(varname)
[01:27:59] <raj> anyone?
[01:28:04] <raj> how do I cancel a function?
[01:28:59] <mindis|wurk> return false?
[01:30:00] <Saiko> I'm using colorbox and after the second time I open a colorbox the colorboxes gets stacked. Thus I open 1 colorbox but I have to close 2, 3, 4 etc.
[01:30:02] <Saiko> http://pastebin.com/Y1P6cSst
[01:30:15] <raj> mindis|wurk, I'd like for everytime Start is clicked, the #timer1 is reset to 0 and counted up again (timer2 should only start counting the first time Start is pressed) http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/n7qvK/ but I don't know how to cancel the previous setInterval function
[01:31:50] <crazy_phone> raj
[01:31:55] <crazy_phone> as you hav e pasted it
[01:32:08] <crazy_phone> you will get the time
[01:32:14] <crazy_phone> from when the start was clicked
[01:32:24] <crazy_phone> and every time you click start ( call the function )
[01:32:25] <Cork> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/LbjHV/
[01:32:27] <crazy_phone> you will restart it
[01:33:52] <Xotix> Hi, wanted to make some clean up logic on paste. I have 2 problems, if i select some text and paste, it doesn't get replaces (this isn't a hard problem) the main problem is that i loose my breaks. The idea was, to delete all formatting which acutally works since i use .text() but it also deleted my breaks. Why? http://jsfiddle.net/7mGfZ/
[01:33:53] <Cork> it could be optimized a bit by storing the old progress value
[01:33:59] <Cork> raj: ^
[01:34:06] <Cork> but thats the basic idea
[01:34:54] <raj> so requestAnimationFrame just passes a timestamp argument by default?
[01:35:48] <Cork> yes
[01:36:11] <Cork> and the little anonymous wrapper up there gives a fallback for ie
[01:36:26] <Cork> older ie (<ie10)
[01:37:26] <raj> any jquery plugin thta uses requestAnimationFrame? cuz I'm not sure how to reset timers correctly
[01:37:36] <raj> that way, I can just call a method on the timer
[01:37:47] <Cork> jquerys animate used to do it
[01:37:58] <raj> deprecated?
[01:38:11] <Cork> but too many developers can't handle the concept that animation isn't constant
[01:38:15] <Cork> so they had to back it out
[01:38:31] <Cork> == too many carusell plugins broke
[01:38:40] <Cork> (badly written carusells)
[01:39:05] <raj> i see
[01:39:37] <Cork> sadly the js community has too many developers that don't really know how to do things right
[01:40:00] <Cork> especially when it comes to animation
[01:40:05] <raj> that probably includes me
[01:40:26] <Cork> well the problem normally lies in if you want to learn or not
[01:40:35] <Cork> the "it works" mentality is the biggest problem
[01:41:07] <steveccc> is it possible to combine parent with a selector - for example if you have A with children B and C and $(this ) gives C then is it possible to do $parent.child($B).
[01:41:22] <thomedy> oooh cork.. thats mee too and because of that my animation is way jumpy
[01:41:26] <thomedy> i dont like it at all
[01:41:34] <thomedy> i have looked at frame rate and container size
[01:41:37] <thomedy> but its still jumpy
[01:42:18] <Cork> thomedy: what your building your animation with?
[01:42:24] <thomedy> jquery
[01:42:29] <thomedy> is that the question
[01:42:31] <Cork> i mean your using animate or?
[01:42:34] <thomedy> animate()
[01:42:38] <Cork> ok
[01:42:44] <thomedy> i considered using css(+var)I
[01:42:49] <thomedy> but it seemed like more work for the machine
[01:42:57] <thomedy> does that comment make sense
[01:43:08] <Cork> not really
[01:43:21] <thomedy> no mattter im using animate
[01:43:21] <Cork> but like i said, animate uses a setInterval timer
[01:43:32] <thomedy> okay
[01:43:51] <Cork> you could try the patch, or replace animate with an animation frame construction
[01:44:00] <thomedy> i have a patch and messed with frame rate
[01:44:12] <Cork> framerate won't really matter
[01:44:13] <thomedy> i have gone all the way down to 2 and worked my way backwords to
[01:44:26] <thomedy> oh i see what your saying
[01:44:29] <thomedy> im sorry im tired
[01:44:31] <Cork> commonly its that your doing work when its not needed
[01:44:40] <Cork> and is late when its REALLY needed
[01:44:44] <Cork> so it becomes choppy
[01:44:56] <thomedy> ooooh :)do i get to learn how to animate with straight js
[01:45:01] <thomedy> please say thats whats about to happen
[01:45:25] <Cork> thomedy: i'm not going to give you code to replace animate no
[01:45:28] <Cork> :D
[01:45:39] <thomedy> no im not asking you to do the work
[01:45:46] <thomedy> but im really wanting to learn tha t
[01:45:48] <Cork> it has effects to its animation that i don't even have the strength to start coding :)
[01:45:53] <thomedy> and havent had the justification to do it yet
[01:46:10] <Cork> thomedy: grab the unofuscated sourcecode of jquery and read
[01:46:28] <Cork> its quite well commented and fairly easy to follow
[01:46:39] <thomedy> so im just going to get to the point do you have any sugestions
[01:47:03] <thomedy> and is the unobfuscated code in jquery.com or is that the non min.
[01:47:20] <Cork> the development version is
[01:47:42] <Cork> http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery#Download_jQuery
[01:47:45] <thomedy> okay thank you now to the matter at hand do you have any suggestions
[01:47:46] <Cork> "Uncompressed"
[01:49:39] <solars> hey, I'm using jquery ui 1.8.8, and suddenly my datepickers stopped to work, chrome shows: event.layerX and event.layerY are broken and deprecated in WebKit. They will be removed from the engine in the near future. - does anyone why this happens?
[01:49:54] <Cork> thomedy: the patch that was in 1.5 for a brief moment was http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8101
[01:50:04] <Cork> thomedy: and the backout was http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9381
[01:52:37] <rethus> how can i change on mouseover only the big image on the same box? , for http://jsfiddle.net/dLJ9G/3/
[01:52:39] <raj> Cork, should I do window.location.start = null ?
[01:53:45] <Cork> raj: nope
[01:54:07] <Cork> raj: you might want to use window.timer_start = <value>;
[01:54:13] <raj> ah ok
[01:54:17] <Cork> instead of the local one, if you want it global
[01:54:35] <Cork> but that depends on the structure of your code
[01:55:27] <Koganei> so I'm having a lot of trouble keeping track of variable scopes inside my plugins because of nested animations and callbacks and things like that, like I feel kind of stuck when I have to call plugin methods and I don't know how to reach them. I'm not sure where to start research to fix that :o any ideas?
[01:56:41] <raj> Cork, in your code, how would start ever === null within the step function?
[01:56:55] <raj> it's caled after Date.now()
[01:57:54] <thomedy> im not entirely sure how to apply that patch so i have started looking at how to animate js myself
[01:58:08] <thomedy> posibly a bad i dea but im tired and desperate
[01:58:34] <thomedy> i want so badly for this to look great and i cant focus any more but i get so little time to work on this i have to push through the night
[01:59:10] <Cork> raj: at the end of the function it sets it to null when the end is reached
[01:59:22] <codingrobot> I need to observe changes of the attributes of DOM elements. Is there a more convinient way than using setTimeout() and polling for changes?
[01:59:27] <raj> ah, and then the very next step it returns from it
[01:59:39] <Cork> raj: the next step the loop ends yes
[01:59:58] <raj> if you return from it once, does the function no longer run?
[02:00:08] <raj> like requestAnimationFrame() doesn't call it anymore?
[02:00:08] <Cork> its like setTimeout
[02:00:28] <Cork> you need to call it at the end of the function to request a new one
[02:01:12] <Cork> damn...
[02:01:13] <Cork> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekDesN76pQ4
[02:01:22] <Cork> ppl has WAY to much time
[02:02:35] <raj> you have got to be kidding me
[02:02:40] <raj> why???
[02:03:13] <raj> so Cork, what's wrong with this? http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/LbjHV/1/
[02:03:14] <Cork> i mean they have firefighting departments, why shouldn't they have a data center? :D
[02:04:16] <Cork> you never request a new animation frame
[02:05:04] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/LbjHV/2/
[02:05:41] <Cork> so it runs one time and draws the 0 then... nothing
[02:11:41] <granden> Is it possibly to fade in a new background to the body element?
[02:11:59] <granden> I got one now, but I would like to fade in a new one, on top of the old, and then remove the old one.
[02:12:34] <Cork> granden: no
[02:12:41] <Cork> you can only fade elements
[02:13:07] <Cork> so you would have to do a lot of tinkering to add a position fixed element behind your content
[02:13:10] <Cork> and fade that
[02:13:18] <codeAssassin> granden: try http://buildinternet.com/2009/02/supersized-full-screen-backgroundslideshow-jquery-plugin/
[02:15:25] <thomedy> is it smart to try to animate this site myself with straight js or is my frustration and sleep deprivation causing bad decisions
[02:15:45] <thomedy> cuz for the life of me i cant make this animation smooth in jquery
[02:16:01] <NodeX> perhaps pastebin your code?
[02:16:52] <thomedy> well i can but its a bunch
[02:16:57] <thomedy> no matter i will
[02:17:01] <thomedy> whatever fixes this
[02:17:19] <NodeX> perhaps just the animation part
[02:17:22] <thomedy> its possible tha tim overcomplicating my jquery and im hoping that snot it cuz that will be a big fix
[02:17:25] <thomedy> i can do that
[02:18:24] <codeAssassin> thomedy: if you could make it work in a jsfiddle, people could take a look at it, mess around a bit etc
[02:18:43] <thomedy> yeah i am one sec please and  way thank you
[02:21:40] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/nv6Md/
[02:22:00] <thomedy> now i have a nother problem it seems to be working fine in the fiddle but if you go to www.thesartorer.com
[02:22:02] <thomedy> its jumpy
[02:23:13] <steveccc> does anyone here write jquery for use in drupal - do you know how to add a path to an image when you wont know the directory structure?
[02:23:24] <thomedy> i can help you with taht steve
[02:23:26] <thomedy> what are youd oing
[02:23:41] <thomedy> oh crap
[02:23:42] <thomedy> nm
[02:23:56] <thomedy> you would have to do s file search in jquery and jquery is client side
[02:24:12] <NodeX> ok which bit is not smooth thomedy ?
[02:24:41] <fuchstronaut> in the fiddle it behaves strangely, but the liveversion is just fine for me
[02:24:47] <thomedy> really
[02:24:50] <fuchstronaut> at least the mouseover stuff
[02:24:55] <thomedy> right click a link
[02:25:02] <thomedy> thats the problem im having its jumpy
[02:25:33] <fuchstronaut> you mean that hickup at the end of that animation?
[02:25:42] <thomedy> AAAAAAAAAAAAA yes the hickup
[02:25:44] <thomedy> i hate it
[02:26:06] <steveccc> thomedy: basically i am using .append to add an image to a div but i need to reference the path to the image but I dont want to hard code it if I can help it so was hoping to use /path/to/theme/images/image.jpg but am unsure how to get the path/to...... into the jquery function
[02:26:22] <thomedy> okay this is what i have done in the past steve
[02:26:30] <thomedy> how much drupal do you know
[02:26:39] <fuchstronaut> (steveccc): can you output that path using php into a a js-variable and work with that
[02:26:42] <steveccc> thomedy: some but probably not alot
[02:26:50] <fuchstronaut> as js wont know your server path's
[02:26:56] <circlicious> i bind click event to all anchor tags and which has an ajax request. but the requests doesnt seems to be made, why so ?
[02:26:59] <thomedy> send the image path in views i think its called hide it with your css
[02:27:00] <circlicious> i am doing this to track user activity
[02:27:02] <thomedy> and then find it in js
[02:27:03] <circlicious> just to know which links are clicked more and which are clicked less
[02:27:06] <thomedy> now you have the path
[02:27:22] <thomedy> hes right though js is client side so your server needs to send it
[02:27:31] <fuchstronaut> thomedy are you manipulating the dom while doing the animation (adding images and stuff?)
[02:27:32] <thomedy> so use views hide it iin css find it with js
[02:27:33] <thomedy> done
[02:27:40] <thomedy> yep
[02:27:47] <thomedy> and i think thats the problem the more i do it
[02:27:53] <thomedy>  i have a .load at the end
[02:27:59] <thomedy> its not a call back
[02:28:06] <thomedy> but its setTimeouted to the end
[02:28:11] <fuchstronaut> hm, maybe you should do that manipulation befor you animate
[02:28:18] <thomedy> oh not a bad idea
[02:28:23] <fuchstronaut> so the user will have to wait 0.5seco longer, but wont have that hickup
[02:28:23] <thomedy> and then show with css
[02:28:25] <fuchstronaut> ye
[02:28:30] <thomedy> yeah that will wokr fine
[02:28:35] <fuchstronaut> or maybe you can even preload the pictures
[02:28:41] <fuchstronaut> and just do it all with css
[02:28:43] <thomedy> you know i have never learned how to do taht
[02:28:46] <fuchstronaut> without ajax and stuff
[02:28:57] <fuchstronaut> me neither, im just guessing what might help
[02:29:14] <thomedy> well the problem is that the content is dynamic its a multi vendor commerce site so i have no idea how to do taht
[02:29:15] <fuchstronaut> usually DOM manipulation is what makes it stutter
[02:29:22] <thomedy> yeah dom thats it
[02:29:25] <thomedy> that stotally it
[02:29:36] <thomedy> how do i change my nickname to retarded
[02:29:42] <altin> anyone tested accordion in jquery UI
[02:29:43] <retarded> ha
[02:29:43] <retarded> ha
[02:29:52] <altin> I cant find how to change the animation speed
[02:30:10] <fuchstronaut> ?animate
[02:30:11] <bot-t> .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[02:30:16] <fuchstronaut> duration
[02:30:48] <loves_fuchstrona> is that at me....that should work
[02:30:59] <loves_fuchstrona> i enjoy changing my nick name
[02:31:37] <raj> Cork, sorry, I'm still on this...can you tell me what's wrong with trying to call step() with an additional argument? http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/LbjHV/3/
[02:31:45] <raj> that way I can reset the correct timer (timer1) only
[02:32:39] <loves_fuchstrona> i did it i pulled a all nighter my youngest son will be up in 30 minutes and i am proud of myself
[02:32:49] <Cork> raj: you can't do it like that
[02:32:49] <loves_fuchstrona> im going to go home and get breakfast while i fix this cuz im hungry
[02:32:53] <loves_fuchstrona> no
[02:32:57] <loves_fuchstrona> im going to try this first
[02:34:02] <raj> Cork, I basically want the original button to disappear, and a new one appear
[02:34:17] <raj> and then that new one will be able to reset timer1, and have no effect on timer2
[02:34:37] <Cork> raj: your giving the return value from the step to requestAnimationFrame
[02:34:50] <raj> oh
[02:35:10] <Cork> step() will actually invoke the function
[02:35:30] <Cork> requestAnimationFrame (just like setTimeout and setInterval) takes a function reference
[02:35:50] <raj> Cork, but there's no return value from step
[02:35:56] <Cork> exactly
[02:36:03] <Cork> so your referencing null
[02:36:09] <Cork> or rather undefined
[02:36:40] <Cork> you could have a wrapper function that scopes the target
[02:36:47] <Cork> but then the step function would break
[02:36:51] <raj> hmmm, confused
[02:36:55] <raj> ok, maybe I'm sleepy
[02:36:57] <Cork> as it would have to have that reference too
[02:37:04] <raj> I'll come back in the morning and play more with this
[02:37:12] <Cork> hmm, wait, that should work
[02:37:18] <raj> thanks for the help Cork :)
[02:37:22] <raj> what should work?
[02:37:47] <Saiko> Colorbox is opening multiple instances for no reason please help
[02:39:06] <Cork> raj: and additionally what your doing would only create two fields that count the same value
[02:39:26] <raj> yes, i was working my way into an if statement that separated them
[02:39:28] <Xotix> Hi, wanted to make some clean up logic on paste. I have 2 problems, if i select some text and paste, it doesn't get replaces (this isn't a hard problem) the main problem is that i loose my breaks. The idea was, to delete all formatting which acutally works since i use .text() but it also deleted my breaks. Why? http://jsfiddle.net/7mGfZ/ 
[02:39:32] <raj> just wanted to make it work stepwise
[02:39:35] <raj> no pun intended
[02:42:01] <Cork> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/LbjHV/4/
[02:42:34] <Cork> the reason is that your using a global variable
[02:42:52] <raj> why's that a problem?
[02:42:52] <Cork> could be fixed by simply using .data instead
[02:43:00] <Cork> cause you only have one for all timers?
[02:43:32] <raj> one what?
[02:43:34] <raj> button?
[02:43:39] <Cork> one timer variable
[02:43:41] <Cork> "start"
[02:43:58] <raj> well, one is going to increment forever, and the other resets everytime any start button is pressed
[02:44:18] <raj> but once clicked, a started button should be .removed()
[02:47:17] <thomedy> im pretty sure now that its the dom .load tha tis causing the hick up
[02:47:29] <thomedy> now ijus thave to send the .load and then the animation
[02:47:59] <raj> Cork, I thank you for all the guidance :) I really appreciate it, it makes me a better coder. My eyes are actually closing on my so I think I better hit the sack!
[02:48:03] <raj> goodnight buddy :)
[02:48:32] <hafos> Im trying to use $('.checkbox_complete').click(function(){ console.log("test"); }) but this doesn't appear to work... I have multiple checkboxes generated via my rails app, anyone know what I could be doing wrong ?
[02:48:53] <NodeX> pastebin/jsfiddle your code
[02:49:51] <crazy_phone> $('.checkbox_complete').bind("click",function(){ console.log("test"); })
[02:49:56] <crazy_phone> try this hafos
[02:50:58] <hafos> crazy_phone: doesnt seem to work, not in firebug nor the chrome javascript console
[02:51:29] <hafos> how can I validate that this shows up in console in the first place? for all I know the event fires but I dont see anything in console
[02:51:35] <mindis|wurk> are your elements present when the document is loaded?
[02:51:47] <hafos> they are
[02:51:50] <hafos> class name is correct
[02:52:12] <mindis|wurk> so if you try something like $('.checkbox_complete').remove() they disappear?
[02:52:45] <hafos> hmm nope they dont
[02:53:26] <mindis|wurk> then either the element doesn't exist on load or your selector is just wrong
[02:53:51] <shoky> hafos: checked your console?
[02:53:59] <hafos> well yes of course shoky  :-)
[02:54:11] <shoky> jsfiddle is the next step ;P
[02:54:22] <hafos> Im going to check in the rails channel, might be specific to rails with its asset pipeline etc
[02:54:35] <shoky> it has nothing to do with rails when its in the browser
[02:54:43] <shoky> either your html/js is fine or its not ;p
[02:56:28] <hafos> shoky: if the element is not there when the dom loads, perhaps it IS in fact a problem with rails...
[02:56:57] <shoky> hafos: then check your browser's developer tools to see if the element is there
[02:57:29] <shoky> hafos: also did you put the code in DOM ready handler ;p
[03:00:08] <shoky> hafos what do you mean how can you validate that it shows up in the console?
[03:00:14] <hafos> shoky: the people in the rails channel pointed that out, I did not... problem solved :-)
[03:00:24] <shoky> ;p
[03:06:30] <poppiez> hi, in all my AJAX request I include a timestamp in seconds for when the request happened and then PHP checks $_SERVER['REQUEST_TIME'] and disallows a difference for more than 30 seconds. however, for requests that go through right away can be off by 50 seconds on some computers. is it because getTime() is accuracy/out of sync?
[03:07:03] <poppiez> this is how I do it: timestamp: Math.round(new Date().getTime() / 1000)
[03:08:02] <fuchstronaut> (poppiez): I guess it's because JavaScript depends on system time and users can have their clock set to whatever they want
[03:10:30] <poppiez> fuchstronaut: yeah, I might have to increase the 30 second threshold to 300 seconds (5 minutes)
[03:10:41] <poppiez> I don't think clocks can be that much out of sync
[03:11:26] <fuchstronaut> they can
[03:11:33] <fuchstronaut> they can be for example out of sync for 24 h
[03:11:43] <fuchstronaut> or users can live in different timezones
[03:15:04] <poppiez> fuchstronaut: but doesn't new Date().getTime() get the UTC time?
[03:15:43] <shoky> it gets the system time on the system it runs on ..
[03:17:00] <quicksilver> it should be UTC time, if the system is correctly configured
[03:17:08] <granden> If I got a selector for a div like this $('#bak') how would I add a new div start at the top of the div and an end tag at the end of that div?
[03:17:08] <quicksilver> however, users can configure their timezones wrongly.
[03:17:26] <quicksilver> ?wrap @ granden
[03:17:27] <bot-t> granden, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[03:17:37] <shoky> poppiez: its  new Date() that is getting the time,  not getTime()
[03:17:39] <poppiez> quicksilver: I guess I could take getTimezoneOffset
[03:17:45] <quicksilver> poppiez: that does not help.
[03:17:56] <quicksilver> poppiez: the point is, users can screw up their time in arbitrary ways.
[03:17:59] <shoky> poppiez: about new Date()  - If you supply no arguments, the constructor creates a JavaScript Date object for today's date and time according to local time.
[03:18:05] <shoky> emphasis on _local_
[03:18:16] <quicksilver> computers are configured by human beings who can either make mistakes, or be malicious.
[03:18:35] <poppiez> so no way of getting UTC time?
[03:18:38] <shoky> i set my system time 5 mins in advance..
[03:18:47] <quicksilver> the only reliable way is from your server.
[03:19:00] <quicksilver> you can compare a timestamp from your server with the javascript time
[03:19:00] <granden> quicksilver: But If I then got <div id="bak"></div> and add <div id="bak2"> using wrap would that not be equall to <div id="bak2"><div id="bak"></div></div>?
[03:19:17] <quicksilver> granden: yes indeed, isn't that what you wanted?
[03:19:40] <granden> quicksilver: No I would like it <div id="bak"><div id="bak2"></div></div>
[03:20:33] <quicksilver> granden: actually not sure the best way. Perhaps $('#bak').html('<div id="bak2">' + $('#bak').html() + '</div>');
[03:20:38] <quicksilver> maybe there is a clevrerer way.
[03:20:47] <shoky> granden: $('#bak').children().wrapAll( ... )
[03:21:02] <shoky> hmm
[03:21:07] <shoky> if there are no children though
[03:21:11] <shoky> then nvm.
[03:22:06] <quicksilver> shoky: not sure that does the right thing with text nodes
[03:22:20] <shoky> quicksilver: also true, .contents().wrapAll in that case
[03:22:31] <shoky> quicksilver: but still your way is probably better
[03:22:49] <quicksilver> or, change the id of bak to bak2
[03:22:52] <quicksilver> and then wrap it in bak :)
[03:22:57] <shoky> ;P
[03:23:15] <quicksilver> $('#bak').attr('id','bak2').wrap('<div id='#bak'/>')
[03:23:21] <quicksilver> this may be faster
[03:23:57] <shoky> u sneaky u
[03:25:00] <granden> shoky: #bak div contains my whole website
[03:25:17] <granden> But I got a bakgrund in #bak that I try to change using fade in out.
[03:26:47] <shoky> granden just use quicksilver's last suggestion
[03:26:58] <steveccc> can jquery return an elements name?
[03:27:10] <shoky> steveccc: its name attribute?
[03:27:16] <steveccc> shoky: yes
[03:27:23] <shoky> steveccc:  .attr('name')
[03:28:00] <steveccc> shoky: thanks
[03:29:35] <granden> shoky: Could I add an animation effect to fade it in to that?
[03:29:50] <shoky> granden: fade what into what?
[03:29:59] <granden> quicksilver: Can I have a fadeIn effect for the bak2 element on that?
[03:30:13] <granden> I will give an example.
[03:31:04] <granden> shoky: http://a45.se/mobilbygg/index.html - Pressing the boxes Komplett Byggföretag Referens Grand Hotel etc
[03:31:10] <granden> changes the background
[03:31:21] <granden> but I would like the new background to be fadded in and after that removing the old one
[03:31:24] <granden> and having it like that.
[03:31:46] <shoky> that's possible sure..
[03:32:58] <granden> shoky: Time to give an example on how?
[03:33:38] <granden> $('#bak').attr('id','bak2').wrap('<div id='#bak'/>').fadeIn()?
[03:35:16] <shoky> i don't really understand how the new bak2 div fits in..
[03:35:26] <granden> I would not mind doing it someway else
[03:35:39] <granden> I just thaght I would add a new div and fade that in.
[03:35:46] <granden> But if there is a better solution I'm up for it.
[03:36:14] <granden> I got, .bakgrund1 .bakgrund2 .bakgrund3 for those three buttons that changes.
[03:36:25] <shoky> yea i see
[03:36:57] <shoky> if you just want to change between 3 classes with different background-image
[03:37:03] <shoky> on the same element
[03:37:20] <shoky> then i think only css3 transitions could do that, not sure
[03:37:27] <shoky> umm otherwise,
[03:37:31] <granden> ah
[03:38:05] <shoky> have seperate divs for the 3 backgrounds,
[03:38:07] <granden> I know of a site that does not use css3 to do it.
[03:38:09] <shoky> but
[03:38:30] <granden> tibabygg.se they dont use css3 transitions or do they?
[03:39:35] <shoky> no, they have seperate <img>s that they are fading between
[03:39:41] <shoky> you could do that too
[03:39:55] <granden> could I have a repeating img?
[03:40:03] <granden> On really really big screens I got theme01bg.jpg
[03:40:13] <granden> that is repeating.
[03:40:13] <shoky> what do you mean repeating?
[03:40:28] <granden> it repeats in x-axis
[03:40:39] <shoky> umm i dont see a prob with that.. donno
[03:41:41] <granden> hmm
[03:41:48] <shoky> me i'd just create seperate divs with the different images,
[03:42:00] <granden> as backgrounds in the divs?
[03:42:06] <shoky> and i'd play with their z-index and fade their opacity
[03:42:08] <shoky> yea
[03:42:17] <granden> ok
[03:42:20] <granden> will try that.
[03:42:31] <granden> sounds like a workable solution.
[03:42:39] <shoky> ;p goodluck
[03:43:11] <granden> could I animate a opacity transition from 0 - 1?
[03:43:18] <shoky> sure
[03:43:25] <granden> and 1-0?
[03:43:32] <shoky> ya
[03:43:36] <granden> cool
[03:43:42] <shoky> any valid value to any valid value ;P
[03:44:28] <shoky> of course, fadeIn() and fadeOut() could be useful too, but they also fiddle with the 'display'
[03:44:32] <granden> shoky: Hmm
[03:44:38] <shoky> so .animate() for full control
[03:44:53] <granden> I added 2 divs
[03:44:59] <granden> with class bakgrund2 and bakgrund3
[03:45:13] <granden> one problem though, when having opacity 0 on bakgrund3 and 2
[03:45:19] <granden> the content of the divs is not visible
[03:45:25] <granden> thats get 0 opacity as well :)
[03:45:36] <shoky> i wouldn't have these divs be the parent of your whole site's contents
[03:46:16] <granden> ok
[03:46:17] <shoky> i'd do smth like:   <div id="backgrounds<div class="background1">...</div>
[03:46:18] <granden> but thamn
[03:46:18] <shoky> oops
[03:46:20] <granden> damn*
[03:46:32] <granden> the whole page jumped down alot :)
[03:47:19] <shoky> i'd do smth like:   <div id="backgrounds"> <div class="background1"></div><div bg2></div><div bg3></div> </div>     <div id="sitecontents">...................</div>
[03:47:37] <shoky> have them seperate, with position:absolute
[03:47:43] <granden> ah, ok.
[03:48:08] <shoky> and have the sitecontents div have higher z-index
[03:48:08] <shoky> or smth
[03:48:45] <granden> hmm
[03:50:26] <granden> shoky: Is it possible to modify a class using jquery?
[03:50:28] <mcspeccy> quick question, if i remove a li element from a list (using remove() ) and then check the length of the list, i am getting a number back that includes the removed element. how do I get around this?
[03:50:35] <granden> like my bakgrund1..3 classes
[03:50:39] <granden> to change z-index on them.
[03:51:09] <granden> can't have fixed z-indexes on those. Then I can not jump the freely.
[03:51:57] <shoky> granden: no you shouldn't change classes at runtime
[03:52:22] <granden> hmm
[03:52:24] <shoky> granden: but you can change z-index of the divs themselves
[03:52:38] <shoky> and that overrides the z-index of any class they have
[03:52:43] <granden> ah
[03:53:09] <granden> and that would be using the attr()?
[03:53:30] <Otkrick> Hello, world! Can anybody help me with a small javascript? pls
[03:54:16] <mindis|wurk> asking to ask isn't very useful. you should just ask
[03:55:09] <shoky> granden:  .css(...)
[03:55:40] <shoky> mcspeccy: how are you checking the length of the list ?
[03:55:58] <shoky> mcspeccy: you need to run the selector again..
[03:56:12] <mcspeccy> .length have tried .size() but it still returns the same
[03:56:47] <mcspeccy> shoky: due to some sort of caching ?
[03:56:56] <granden> shoky: Hahaha, stpuid me, I thought I would do .attr("style","z-index:-1;") hahaha
[03:57:14] <Otkrick> mindis|wurk: :) http://www.webdevout.net/test?06 I replace symbols with function `test`.. how can I add a symbol '[' in arr1? "[" cause to error
[03:57:18] <shoky> mcspeccy: no. the element is not removed from the jquery collection, only from the DOM
[03:57:44] <mcspeccy> shoky: ah i see
[03:57:47] <Xotix> wanted to make some clean up logic on paste. I have 2 problems, if i select some text and paste, it doesn't get replaces (this isn't a hard problem) the main problem is that i loose my breaks. The idea was, to delete all formatting which acutally works since i use .text() but it also deleted my breaks. Why? http://jsfiddle.net/7mGfZ/ 
[03:58:24] <shoky> granden that'd work too ;P but would override any other inline styles too
[03:59:09] <granden> shoky: Yeah, and would not like to do that. :)
[03:59:38] <granden> If I want to do the same css change to two divs. I could do $('.bakgrund1 .bakgrund3).css() right?
[04:00:00] <mindis|wurk> probably $('.bakgrund1, .bakgrund3).css()
[04:00:14] <mindis|wurk> unless one is inside the other
[04:00:26] <Xotix> granden with a , yes
[04:01:08] <granden> ah, ok they are not inside each other. Thanks!
[04:01:33] <mcspeccy> shoky: if I call .find() on the object, will it not traverse the DOM again ?
[04:02:10] <granden> hmm, dont get it to work for some reason. The fade in.
[04:02:33] <granden> http://a45.se/mobilbygg/index.html
[04:02:50] <granden> the code is only running on button 2 uppon pressing it.
[04:05:00] <granden> oh it acctually works only places the image at the wrong place :)
[04:06:37] <Otkrick> guys, I replace symbols with function `test`.. how can I add a symbol '[' in Lit1? var Lit1 = [ "[", "G", "8" ]; var Lit2 = [ "u", "T", "j" ]; brings error. (http://www.webdevout.net/test?06)
[04:08:42] <tansaku> I'm playing with the jqueryui autocomplete, and I'm wondering if anyone can point me to some good examples of alternate search methods -  I have been googling for an hour and I still don't seem to have found a good example of how to change things to search against the first letter of the possible terms, rather than matching against all letters ...
[04:10:33] <SoulRaven> hello
[04:11:20] <SoulRaven> is posibile to find out the dialog div, from inside of another js script located inside the dialog
[04:14:39] <tansaku> think I found the answer to my question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7784990/jquery-ui-autocomplete-search-from-the-beginning-of-the-string?rq=1
[04:17:59] <shoky> tansaku
[04:18:03] <shoky> i made you an example also..
[04:18:08] <shoky> here: http://jsfiddle.net/BLnXB/
[04:18:12] <tansaku> shoky: thanks dude!
[04:18:46] <tansaku> shoky: very helpful - I was struggling to digest http://jsfiddle.net/jensbits/PekQZ/ :-)
[04:19:33] <shoky> heh
[04:19:36] <shoky> np
[04:21:45] <granden> Thanks EVERYONE for the help with my div/background problem!
[04:22:13] <shoky> looks nice granden ;>
[04:22:17] <mindis|wurk> hmm, interesting. i'm occasionally getting the wrong handle in resizables stop event. dragging the n handle occasionally shows the s handle as the event target
[04:22:26] <tansaku> my crazy plan going forward is that after the user has selected a single word, that they should be able to start autocomplete on a new word that uses the previous word as context ...
[04:22:51] <shoky> tansaku that doesnt sound crazy nor difficult ;P
[04:23:15] <shoky> i think working from my fiddle it'd be a piece of cake
[04:24:27] <Nomikos> Any swipe plugin/libs recommendations? my google fu has a hangover I think
[04:26:44] <bitbuzzer> hi, I have an array of items like so {name: 'foo', department: 'bar'} where each item can only belong to one department. I'd like to create an aggregated array of unique departments (bar, bar1,bar2) and their unique items. will $.extend work here?
[04:27:41] <tansaku> shoky: I hope so - I think my ability to complete it may be impeded by poor javascript/jquery skills :-) http://tansaku.github.com/twss/adventure
[04:28:15] <fourlastor> is there any plan to support webgl in jquery?
[04:28:35] * shoky doubts
[04:28:59] <fourlastor> it would be awesome tho :P
[04:30:22] <shoky> a seperate awesome plugin for that would be awesomer
[04:30:33] <shoky> why put everything in the same place..
[04:30:54] <shoky> jquery is not about graphics
[04:31:11] <fourlastor> it could be an idea
[04:31:35] <shoky> go for it ;p
[04:31:46] <fourlastor> i'm studying webgl first :)
[04:32:10] <shoky> enjoy the matrix ;p
[04:34:13] <shoky> tansaku, cute. i'd enjoy that more if it wasnt a dropdown but an in-place autocomplete (like in chrome's console for example)
[04:34:27] <shoky> or a combination of both, really
[04:34:48] <s-Code> hey guise if im using .load for ajax stuff and absolutely nothing happens, incl capturing errors as the API example and no apache access log entry for the called script; what might be the cause?
[04:35:37] <shoky> s-Code: no errors in the console?
[04:35:53] <s-Code> nope, syntax is right other stuff fire fine
[04:36:14] <shoky> pastebin da code ;p
[04:36:21] <tansaku> shoky: you mean like this? http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13196858/chrome-console.jpg  has dropdown, but also shows first choice on command line?
[04:36:39] <shoky> tansaku yes exactly
[04:37:08] <tansaku> shoky: interesting - guess jquery-ui could do that right - start filling in the top selection in the input text ...
[04:37:16] * shoky hides
[04:37:38] <s-Code> i'll try isolating stuff first see if im missing something else a bit much for a paste
[04:37:47] * tansaku counts to twenty out loud and says "coming ready or not ..."
[04:37:56] <shoky> l0l
[04:38:13] <shoky> donno if jqui has something to help with that
[04:39:16] <s-Code> lol im a moron, had \$("sf-suggest").load
[04:39:25] <s-Code> while sf-suggest is an id not a bloody tag
[04:39:47] <shoky> bitbuzzer: hmm why $.extend ?
[04:41:32] <bitbuzzer> shoky: $.extend  doesn't seem to meet my needs...I guess I'll write an algorithm to iterate and build the aggregated array.
[04:44:15] <shoky> bitbuzzer: var u = {}; $.each(arr, function() { u[this.department] = u[this.department] || []; u[this.department].push(this) });
[04:45:05] <shoky> then u['bar'] is an array of all items with department 'bar'
[04:45:15] <bitbuzzer> shoky: thanks, I'll give that a try
[04:56:21] <foodoo> hi, I have inherited some old code. Opera considers it to be a syntax error. Firefox is okay with it: $(this).('attr') //does this even make sense?
[04:56:52] <foodoo> the result is then concatenated into a string
[04:58:28] <mytoz> $(this).attr(...)
[04:58:36] <Nomikos> How do you capture swipe events in a regular website? I have a slider thing that doesn't support it, and want iPad swipes (say) to trigger its next()/prev() functions
[05:00:18] <foodoo> mytoz: Yes, it could be that this is a typo in the code. And because FF didn't complain, it was never detected. So you are certain that this is really not valid JavaScript or valid Jquery usage?
[05:00:43] <pachet> its not valid javascript
[05:01:24] <foodoo> thank you :) Maybe I can find out why FF doesn't complain and then file a bug report
[05:02:26] <ravenzz> Nomikos http://www.netcu.de/jquery-touchwipe-iphone-ipad-library
[05:03:10] <Nomikos> ravenzz: does tweaking that allow for page scrolling still, when swiping up or down?
[05:03:22] <ravenzz> i guess so
[05:05:38] <duderion> i have a problem combining draggable, sortable and resizable. i want to drag thumbs from a media-pool to a playlist div. and the thumbs should be resizable and sortable afterwards
[05:05:51] <duderion> drag and sort work, but resize doesnt
[05:05:57] <duderion> here is a small demo: http://duderion.dyndns.org/test/
[05:09:18] <ravenzz> Nomikos anyway you could edit it so it will fits your needs, eg remove the up/down swiping part
[05:09:31] <Nomikos> trying, thanks
[05:09:38] <duderion> i'd like to change the element's width in the playlist, without losing the abilit to sort...
[05:09:46] <duderion> thanks in advance...
[05:11:41] <Xotix> does .text() delete breaks?
[05:12:23] <Nomikos> not as such, but HTML doesn't show linefeeds as breaks. maybe you want .html() ?
[05:13:34] <xemdetia> I'm really curious about the right way to test all elements returned by a selector for a particular jQuery UI function to test whether an option was set correctly. Maybe I am messing up using .each. Does anyone have any ideas on what I could try?
[05:14:00] <pachet> maybe you could clarify what you mean by 'test all elements'
[05:14:04] <DeltaHeavy> Does anybody notice any strange jQuery behavior where alt tabbing sometimes triggers events or does my code have errors?
[05:14:36] <mcspeccy> shoky: the element is still showing even after running the selector again
[05:15:27] <DeltaHeavy> nvm, after looking for that problem for days I've coincidently found out what it is. Sorry
[05:19:42] <Xotix> how can i get content out of a textarea and put it into a contenteditable div without loosing breaks?
[05:20:40] <Cork> Xotix: make the contentEditable preserve line breaks
[05:20:49] <Cork> or regex replace \n with <br>
[05:22:47] <Xotix> Cork make the contentEditable preserve line breaks   how? Maybe my paste logic is wrong hm
[05:23:24] <Cork> ?mdc white-space @ Xotix
[05:23:26] <bot-t> Xotix, white-space - MDN - The white-space CSS property is used to to describe how whitespace inside the element is handled. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/white-space
[05:23:41] <Xotix> thanks
[05:28:05] <Nomikos> ravenzz: works well enough, thanks
[05:28:36] <Nomikos> (I'd even found it before but misunderstood the examples to not apply to my case..)
[05:28:41] * Nomikos drinks more coffee
[05:29:58] <Xotix> Cork hmm looks shitty you think i just can replace \n with br when using acontenteditable div?
[05:31:26] <jonathancutrell> gday fols
[05:31:28] <jonathancutrell> folks*
[05:31:47] <mcspeccy> why would an element still be reported after using .remove() on it?
[05:32:02] <mcspeccy> ive even ran the selector again, but it is still returned
[05:32:55] <Nomikos> mcspeccy: can you reproduce a simple case in jsfiddle ?
[05:33:01] <foder> maybe there is some other refference to it
[05:33:07] <foder> mcspeccy
[05:33:16] <foder> remove will simply remove it from the view
[05:33:20] <foder> but it will stay in the dom
[05:33:29] <mcspeccy> Nomikos: am building it in jsfiddle now
[05:33:32] <foder> if a existing refference to the element is available
[05:33:41] <foder> since javascript grabage collector
[05:34:05] <foder> doesnt remove dom items with active referencess
[05:35:06] <Nomikos> foder: what kind of references?
[05:35:48] <foder> any kind
[05:35:54] <foder> even if you have a
[05:36:11] <foder> var a = document.getElementById("someid");
[05:36:13] <foder> and then
[05:36:20] <foder> array[] = a;
[05:36:26] <foder> and the array exists
[05:36:33] <foder> the dom element someid
[05:36:35] <foder> will not be
[05:36:37] <foder> removed
[05:36:44] <foder> if you use remove() on it
[05:36:47] <Xotix> foder why are you not writing one sentence? ^^
[05:36:48] <Nomikos> you must have a very narrow irc screen :-)
[05:36:54] <foder> atleast that was the case with me
[05:36:59] <foder> :D
[05:37:10] <foder> i am just used to write like this i dont know why
[05:37:17] <foder> many people say im an ahole for that
[05:37:18] <foder> :D
[05:37:41] <Xotix> its liek a laggy stream :P
[05:38:35] <foder> i will try to stick to long sentences insted of this short stuff i promise , but dont judge if i dont it is just stronger than me :)
[05:39:40] <quicksilver> foder, mcspeccy : you can argue about what you think "being in the DOM" means
[05:39:57] <quicksilver> howerver, removed elements will not be returned by selectors
[05:39:59] <shoky> mcspeccy: sounds fishy. how are you running the selector again
[05:40:03] <Zhy> Hi everyone, I have a div that toggles between visible and not visible when the user hits the space key, how can I prevent the "usual" browser functionality of the space key (scrolls down in chunks)? stopPropagation doesn't seem to do it
[05:40:08] <quicksilver> personally I'd say if they are not in the document they are not "in the DOM".
[05:40:22] <foder> quicksilver you will find how wrong you are one day :D
[05:40:23] <quicksilver> demo of this: http://jsfiddle.net/kQcTQ/
[05:40:28] <quicksilver> foder: see the demo.
[05:40:55] <mcspeccy> shoky: trying to get the example on jsfiddle
[05:42:27] <seutje> Zhy: preventDefault()?
[05:42:28] <Articate> I can have several files with $(document).ready(function() { }); in it, can't I?
[05:42:35] <Nomikos> Articate: yep
[05:42:41] <Nomikos> just don't nest them
[05:42:42] <seutje> stopPropagation is to prevent bubbling, innit?
[05:42:42] <shoky> elements aren't "in the DOM", they're in a DOM tree
[05:42:55] <Articate> How queer.
[05:42:58] <seutje> DOM is dutch for stupid
[05:43:02] <seutje> just throwing that out there
[05:43:14] <seutje> well, "dumb" actually
[05:43:15] <shoky> makes sense
[05:43:55] <orolin> clear
[05:44:00] <Zhy> seutje: thanks a lot, that does it :)
[05:44:05] <foder> quicksilver i wil try to reporduce some of what happened to me
[05:44:11] <foder> i hope i dont get fired for this :D
[05:44:51] <shoky> foder: a memory leak?
[05:44:58] <seutje> not sure I get the issue here, ur re-querying the DOM after removing it, of course it isn't going to show up, ou removed it
[05:45:14] <seutje> u can keep a reference to it around for later use though
[05:45:25] <shoky> there is no issue
[05:45:27] <quicksilver> seutje: mcspeccy's issue was that it *was* showing up.
[05:45:32] <shoky> at least not until mcspeccy finishes his fiddle
[05:45:34] <quicksilver> seutje: presumably he has a bug or misunderstanding.
[05:45:51] <Articate> "jQuery" and "$" are the same, right? Is it more common to use $(document).ready, or jQuery(document).ready?
[05:45:55] <seutje> prolly stored it and is using the reference
[05:46:01] <quicksilver> my tiny fiddle was just to demonstrate that this is definitely not expected behaviour.
[05:46:06] <seutje> Articate: use a closure to avoid messing with other libraries
[05:46:08] <foder> quicksilver
[05:46:11] <seutje> $ is a popular alias
[05:46:11] <foder> explain this
[05:46:12] <foder> http://jsfiddle.net/kQcTQ/7/
[05:46:15] <foder> :)
[05:46:26] <seutje> ur using a reference
[05:46:31] <quicksilver> foder: you're just alerting the list of an array.
[05:46:32] <seutje> foder: ^
[05:46:34] <shoky> foder that's an array, not a DOM tree
[05:46:35] <quicksilver> foder: length of an array, I mean.
[05:46:45] <quicksilver> foder: the length of the array will not change when you remove the elemnet from the DOM
[05:46:46] <foder> omg why it is not updated
[05:46:48] <Articate> seutje: what do you mean?
[05:46:49] <foder> wait i pasted shit
[05:46:50] <quicksilver> the DOM is the DOM your array is an array.
[05:47:09] <Nomikos> foder: uh.. var foo != $('#foo')
[05:47:22] <seutje> Articate: (function($) { /* in here, you're sure $ == jQuery */  })(jQuery) /* here $ can be anything */
[05:47:34] <seutje> (if jQuery existed in the global scope that is)
[05:47:37] <Articate> ah.
[05:47:59] <Articate> so (function($) { $(document).ready .. ?
[05:48:18] <foder> ok quicksilver you might be right or jsfiddle might clear stuff or something
[05:48:18] <shoky> yep
[05:48:20] <seutje> Articate: I suppose
[05:48:26] <foder> but when i say
[05:48:37] <foder> someday you will be there where i was and you will pull your hair
[05:48:47] <jonathancutrell> Articate: another method for avoiding clashes: (function($,w,undefined){ /* In here, you have w as window and $ as jQuery, and "undefined" is guaranteed to be undefined */ })(jQuery, window);
[05:48:49] <foder> then remember poor old foder
[05:48:51] <foder> :D
[05:48:55] <jeffsmykil> How do you call a non-private function that is inside of a widget from outside of the widget?
[05:49:01] <Nomikos> Articate: $(function(){ is the newer version of the document.ready one
[05:49:12] <Articate> ah
[05:49:21] <seutje> foder: perhaps this will illustrate the difference: http://jsfiddle.net/kQcTQ/10/
[05:49:23] <Nomikos> Articate: $(function(){   /* all your jQuery goes here */   });
[05:49:36] <seutje> Nomikos: but that goes inside the closure
[05:49:42] <jonathancutrell> Articate: If you have your script at the bottom of your page, doc ready is implicit.
[05:49:53] <Articate> I keep it in the head
[05:50:01] <jonathancutrell> Articate: You shouldn't. :)
[05:50:01] <foder> quicksilver chek seutje fiddle
[05:50:04] <foder> he got it right
[05:50:08] <Articate> really?
[05:50:11] <seutje> jonathancutrell's example closure is a popular one right now :P
[05:50:14] <foder> this stuff happens all over the place
[05:50:18] <jeffsmykil> $.Widget.foo() isn't working
[05:50:19] <Nomikos> seutje: maybe I misunderstood, thought he was nesting jquery starting 'tags'
[05:50:30] <jonathancutrell> Articate: Yeah - put it at the bottom so it doesn't block loading of the rest of the dom.
[05:50:38] <quicksilver> foder: indeed. seutje's fiddle shows me nothign I didn't know.
[05:50:46] <Articate> Hmm
[05:50:47] <Articate> interesting.
[05:50:58] <seutje> Nomikos: his question was if $ and jQuery are analogous
[05:51:18] <jonathancutrell> Articate: There's a lot of good explanation for this method over on the h5bp
[05:51:24] <Articate> cool
[05:51:25] <Articate> thanks :)
[05:51:33] <seutje> and on a bunch of other stuff too
[05:51:48] <shoky> jeffsmykil: .widgetName('methodName')
[05:51:55] <jonathancutrell> Articate: Also, make sure you are concatenating your scripts and minifying before going live. (Don't concat jQuery - load from a cdn.)
[05:52:01] <jeffsmykil> shoky: ty i wiol try that
[05:52:13] <ScottG> Why are these list elements those toggling and only showing and not toggling? http://jsfiddle.net/VjeKh/7/
[05:52:23] <Nomikos> seutje: ah, reading back, got it now
[05:52:26] <jonathancutrell> Articate: If you really want speed, load jQuery from jQuery's cdn, then load your own concat'd script from an s3 or something.
[05:52:33] <shoky> jeffsmykil: its just like with any method you're used to calling on a jqui widget
[05:53:03] <Articate> thanks, jonathancutrell. Definitely tips I'll take to heart
[05:53:06] <jonathancutrell> Articate: The .htaccess file on h5bp also handles a lot of stuff (like serving Gzipped files)
[05:53:54] <steveccc> is it possible to reference the nth element returned by a selector ie $('img')[2]
[05:54:01] <seutje> ?eq
[05:54:03] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[05:54:13] <jeffsmykil> shoky: this is what Im trying
[05:54:14] <jeffsmykil> 	var offsetDays = $.timeline('getOffset(' + elementId+ ')')
[05:54:15] <shoky> ScottG: what?
[05:54:30] <steveccc> seutje: thanks
[05:54:36] <shoky> jeffsmykil: uhm what's $.timeline
[05:54:43] <seutje> steveccc: if u want the DOM element, just grab it from the array as your example shows, if u want a jQuery object, use eq
[05:54:46] <jeffsmykil> the name of the widget?
[05:55:04] <seutje> shoky: some fancypants developped by some guys at MIT iirc
[05:55:21] <ScottG> shoky: When I click on the nav elements the sub-lists show but they don't rehide when I click on them again. Since I'm using toggle I'd think that they would show/hide toggle.
[05:56:11] <Nomikos> uh. works for me I think
[05:56:29] <jeffsmykil> oh shoky i think i figured it out
[05:56:46] <Nomikos> ScottG: If I click on 'Dropdown' the menu shows, click again and it hides again
[05:56:56] <shoky> jeffsmykil widgets are $.fn.widgetName .. no?
[05:57:03] <Xotix> whers teh difference between bind and delegate? (i know it is deprecated)
[05:57:15] <foder> but quicksilver you might be right after all
[05:57:23] <jeffsmykil> shoky: it's early ;)
[05:57:31] <foder> and my problem when i had it could be something differrent
[05:57:35] <ScottG> Nomikos: That's so weird....I was working on this with my friend the other day and he said the exact same thing...
[05:57:46] <Nomikos> ScottG: have you tried a different browser?
[05:57:46] <foder> as i am not 100% sute about that
[05:58:06] <ScottG> Nomikos: Like it works for him but not me. And I was on a completely different computer. I have been on Chrome on both browsers, though.
[05:58:10] <seutje> Xotix: they work the other way around, bind makes an implicit link between the element and the handler, delegate will put the handler on a parent element and check the event's target for criteria
[05:58:34] <Nomikos> ScottG: I see what you mean, it doesn't work in Safari
[05:58:37] <Xotix> seutje whats the difference between live and delegate?
[05:59:22] <DeltaHeavy> Does jQuery's .change() work on IE? If not which ones? All of them? I'm reading it doesn't in some places but there's conflicting information.
[05:59:27] <ScottG> Nomikos: It works in IE, still not in Chrome like I said.
[05:59:40] <Xotix> DeltaHeavy:  it works in 8 9
[05:59:48] <seutje> Xotix: live functions on the jQuery object u want to bind it to and implies you want you delegation to happen on the document level, delegate allows you to decide where the delegation happens
[05:59:49] <ScottG> Nomikos: Can you see why it might not be working in Chrome?
[05:59:51] <Xotix> scott_gonzalez:  it also works in chrome
[05:59:59] <seutje> I suck at explaining this
[06:00:03] <seutje> Xotix: http://www.elijahmanor.com/2012/02/differences-between-jquery-bind-vs-live.html
[06:00:06] <Xotix> at least for file input it works in chrome.
[06:00:08] <ScottG> Xotix:
[06:00:24] <ScottG> Xotix: I'm on verison 19.0.1084.56 m of chrome nad it doens't work
[06:00:34] <seutje> same here btw
[06:01:13] <Xotix> delegation just works for some area?
[06:01:39] <seutje> if you mean "it doesn't work for other areas", then no, it does
[06:01:45] <seutje> it just allows you to limit the scope
[06:01:54] <Xotix> ScottG it does I'm absolutely sure. What exactly are you trying? For me it always worked.
[06:02:05] <Nomikos> ScottG: I'm trying to get it to work in Safari :p
[06:02:10] <Nomikos> similar enough
[06:02:20] <seutje> $('.foo').live('click', handler) is the same as $(document).delegate('.foo', 'click', handler); if I'm not mistaken
[06:02:29] <Xotix> so with delegate i can say, do foo for each element with the classs bar which are within the element fooBar?
[06:02:37] <Xotix> seutje thanks
[06:02:39] <seutje> it's just that delegate allows you to choose the document part
[06:02:44] <seutje> live doesn't (afaik)
[06:02:51] <Xotix> and knwo we got on which combines theses 2?
[06:02:52] <ScottG> Xotix: So why isn't it working for me in chrome?
[06:03:11] <ScottG> I doesn't work outside of jfiddle either.
[06:03:15] <Nomikos> ScottG: crazier, if you replace toggle() by slideToggle() it takes 3 clicks for it to return to the starting position
[06:03:28] <Xotix> ScottG probably I'm using it differently. Where do you use it?
[06:03:32] <Nomikos> (and it messes with the layout)
[06:03:36] <seutje> also, that's the same as $(document).bind('click', function(e) { if ($(e.target).is('.foo')) { doHandlerShizzle(); }  });
[06:04:13] <Xotix> seutje interesting
[06:04:45] <shoky> ScottG: http://jsfiddle.net/VjeKh/9/
[06:04:52] <jonathancutrell> seutje: or $(document).on("click", ".foo", function(e){ doHandlerShizzle(); /* 'this' refers to .foo here */ })
[06:05:01] <shoky> ScottG i just changed ul to ul.nav  in the  css
[06:05:55] <seutje> jonathancutrell: oh, so it functions the same as delegate now?
[06:06:08] <seutje> or does the second param just define scope?
[06:06:34] <ScottG> shoky: That kinda works. When it closes again Dropdown is on it's own line, though.
[06:06:48] <jonathancutrell> seutje: I'm pretty sure that is basically the same functionality. Under the hood, I'm pretty sure we are looking at clicks that are bubbling up only from the scoped second arg
[06:07:04] <shoky> ScottG: not here
[06:07:16] <seutje> ScottG: u'll need to fix that in the animation callback, set it back to display: inline
[06:07:17] <ScottG> Nomikos: Haha wow that's weird. I'm seeing that too.
[06:07:21] <Nomikos> ScottG: http://jsfiddle.net/VjeKh/10/ uses an alternate way
[06:07:53] <ScottG> Nomikos: Ah. That works for me.
[06:08:02] <seutje> I'd check on visibility instead
[06:08:17] <seutje> god knows what has set it to block, inline-block, or whatever
[06:08:32] <Nomikos> the css does
[06:08:47] <Nomikos> you could also check for != 'none'
[06:08:59] <seutje> ?:visible
[06:08:59] <bot-t> :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[06:09:28] <seutje> ah, DB import complete, back to wrokwrok
[06:09:41] <shoky> nomnom
[06:10:49] <Nomikos> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/VjeKh/14/ this uses is(':visible') but fails to work again.. any idea?
[06:11:07] <Nomikos> (of course, it works in Firefox again..)
[06:12:16] <Nomikos> hm, he must be wroking
[06:13:42] <Nomikos> strange, the is(':visible') claims it's invisible in Safari while *I* can see it, for one
[06:13:48] <Nomikos> usually it's the other way round..
[06:14:09] <mcspeccy> Hi guys, after putting the code into jsfiddle I found the problem.
[06:14:36] <mcspeccy> I had assigned the results to a variable so was checking that again and it was present
[06:15:07] <shoky> jsfiddle to da rescue
[06:15:12] <mcspeccy> :)
[06:15:38] <mcspeccy> rewriting some of it to work in jsfiddle made it stick out!
[06:16:05] <Nomikos> that's half of the purpose of jsfiddle ;-)
[06:16:23] <Nomikos> see also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging
[06:16:40] <mcspeccy> rubber duck debugging, heard of it before
[06:16:50] <mcspeccy> left mine in the bath this morning ;)
[06:17:05] <mcspeccy> thanks anyway guys :)
[06:17:37] <seutje> Nomikos: odd, it always registers it as being invisible, which is prolly why toggle is failing
[06:17:57] <seutje> let this be a lesson, don't toggle() or hide(), toggleClass or removeClass
[06:18:02] <Nomikos> seutje: yeah I noticed that too
[06:18:29] <Nomikos> hrm. code should just do what it's supposed to :p
[06:18:46] <QueueQueue> Hmm, is there any difference optimization wise between $('#myElement').prop('value') and $('#myElement').val() . Or are they virtually the same?
[06:20:40] <seutje> Nomikos: http://jsfiddle.net/VjeKh/15/ ? :D
[06:20:52] <seutje> not so a11y though
[06:21:50] <tocka> im using append() to add some some <divs> to another div, but how could I do that they the new ones would go up top but not to the bottom
[06:21:51] <tocka> ?
[06:22:00] <Nomikos> prepend?
[06:22:46] <tocka> prepend it is!
[06:22:50] <Nomikos> seutje: "a11y" ?
[06:22:50] <tocka> thanks NodeX
[06:22:54] <tocka> Nomikos that is:)
[06:23:03] <Nomikos> :)
[06:23:26] <Nomikos> seutje: the toggleClass() does have an elegance to it
[06:24:42] <ScottG> seutje: That's interesting.
[06:25:01] <duderion> any suggestions concerning mydrag/sort/resize problem ? :)
[06:25:53] <seutje> ?define a11y
[06:26:04] <bot-t> seutje, a11y - (abbreviation) Accessibility.
[06:26:07] <seutje> aw, can't ?define anymore?
[06:26:09] <seutje> ah, there we go
[06:26:24] <seutje> Nomikos: toggleClass has it's own issues though :P
[06:26:39] <Nomikos> why can't things be /simple/
[06:26:58] <seutje> THIS....IS.... THE INTERNETS!
[06:27:02] <shoky> QueueQueue: any difference there would be minor.  in the simplest cases .val()  just returns elem.value
[06:27:06] <Nomikos> I guess it beats reality
[06:27:32] <seutje> QueueQueue: does .prop('value') work for select lists? coz .val() does iirc
[06:27:45] <QueueQueue> @seutje it does.
[06:28:26] <QueueQueue> @Shoky Yeah, I assumed so... Was just confirming. Thanks :)
[06:30:38] <fuchstronaut> jquery is so smart..
[06:30:44] <seutje> ?source val
[06:30:45] <bot-t> Line#2099 - "val: function( value ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#2099
[06:30:56] <shoky> bot-t is not.
[06:30:56] <seutje> sure, link me to a dead page
[06:31:01] <seutje> THANKS BOT-T!
[06:31:28] <fuchstronaut> it did because you are black
[06:31:32] <fuchstronaut> racist bot :/
[06:32:10] <seutje> I am?
[06:32:20] <shoky> don't deny it
[06:32:52] <fuchstronaut> your great at basketball, you play a saxophone...
[06:32:56] <fuchstronaut> its pretty obvious
[06:33:08] <shoky> i also play a sax
[06:33:13] <shoky> but i suck at basketball
[06:33:17] <fuchstronaut> ye, but you play it like a white man
[06:33:21] <shoky> :(
[06:33:37] <fuchstronaut> its because we aint got no swagger
[06:33:40] <shoky> that's the worst thing you could say
[06:33:41] <mink> Yap, you're black independently of skin color :(
[06:33:46] <shoky> to a sax player
[06:33:52] <fuchstronaut> I'm sorry shoky
[06:33:55] <fuchstronaut> I didn't mean to
[06:33:55] <seutje> so does that mean I'm allowed to use the n-word?
[06:33:59] <shoky> its ok :)
[06:34:02] <fuchstronaut> (seutje): of course
[06:34:03] <shoky> at least im not black :PP
[06:34:04] <fuchstronaut> your black
[06:34:05] <fuchstronaut> haha
[06:34:16] <KOTRET> i have a tr containing a link, onclick triggers teh link click. unfortunately the event is fired twice while clicking directly on the link. how to avoid?
[06:34:30] <seutje> I'm white enough to be annoyed by these grammar errors though :P
[06:34:35] <fuchstronaut> stopPropagination
[06:34:36] <fuchstronaut> i guess
[06:34:42] <shoky> pro-pagination
[06:34:57] <fuchstronaut> ye its im pro pagination
[06:35:00] <fuchstronaut> hate to scroll
[06:35:00] <fuchstronaut> really
[06:35:07] <seutje> KOTRET: check if ur clicking a link inside ur handler?
[06:35:41] <fuchstronaut> or use delegate with a selector like 'tr, tr a'
[06:35:55] <fuchstronaut> hmm
[06:35:58] <fuchstronaut> will this work anyway?
[06:35:59] <KOTRET> seutje: how should i check if this event is the event from tr (false if i click the link) or from the link itself?
[06:36:06] <seutje> $('tr').on('click', function(e) { if (!$(e.target).is('a'))  { $(this).find('a').trigger('click'); } }); ?
[06:36:26] <KOTRET> ah i see
[06:36:30] <KOTRET> okay ill try
[06:36:38] <diverdude> WHat is the best way to make a large hover image?
[06:36:42] <seutje> ur trying to propagate clicks from ur row to a link within the row, right?
[06:36:52] <KOTRET> yes
[06:36:55] <diverdude> like, i have a small preview image, and when mouse hovers a large image should be displayed
[06:37:03] <KOTRET> tr works nice but link twice (rhyme inside)
[06:37:27] <fuchstronaut> (diverdude): position fixed and some mouse positioning are the two things that come to my mind
[06:37:46] <seutje> KOTRET: yeah, coz when u click the link, ur also clicking the tr
[06:37:49] <fuchstronaut> (diverdude): but im sure there are tooltip plugins out there that will exactly do that
[06:38:02] <seutje> there's prolly a more elegant approach than my quick example though
[06:38:09] <fuchstronaut> (KOTRET): everyday its bubbleing..
[06:38:27] <seutje> fuchstronaut: writing that down
[06:38:44] <fuchstronaut> excuse me?
[06:38:51] <fuchstronaut> you are writing down what?
[06:38:54] <seutje> IN MA FUNNYBOOK
[06:39:05] <fuchstronaut> OMAGAD, what?
[06:39:09] <seutje> "everyday I'm bubbling"
[06:39:12] <fuchstronaut> oh
[06:39:14] <fuchstronaut> cool
[06:39:26] <fuchstronaut> I'm the first one to buy a ticket for your standup then
[06:39:58] <seutje> I don't do public speaking
[06:40:05] <fuchstronaut> you should
[06:40:06] <KOTRET> seutje: and what if i click an image in the link? is('a')=> false
[06:40:38] <fuchstronaut> I'm goign tos leep
[06:40:42] <fuchstronaut> bye
[06:40:51] <seutje> var $target = $(e.target); if (!$target.is('a') && !$target.closest('a').length) ?
[06:41:04] <seutje> "if it isn't an anchor and doesn't reside within an anchor"
[06:41:23] <diverdude> any recommendations?
[06:41:32] <seutje> k, now I'm really going back to wrok
[06:45:26] <jonathancutrell> diverdude: what do you mean exactly?
[06:46:20] <KOTRET> seutje: this works now
[06:46:33] <KOTRET> thank you for the tip
[06:46:52] <diverdude> jonathancutrell: i got it
[06:47:15] <KOTRET> now i still have another "problem" - if i dont have any click-handler, the link does not get executed - why?
[06:47:48] <derekderekloev> i'm using load() to tell when images are loaded, however, it just loads() continuously if the image has already been loaded, what are my options?
[06:48:28] <KOTRET> even with handler the link does not make the browser follow the links url - this is for security reasons?
[06:50:29] <thornofmight> How do I tell load to not run its load method if the image is already cached
[06:50:57] <jonathancutrell> thornofmight: Probably not an easy way to do that - every browser handles caching differently.
[06:51:13] <jonathancutrell> thornofmight: may want to check how quickly something loads?
[06:51:25] <jonathancutrell> thornofmight: but - that's not really reliable either.
[06:51:59] <jonathancutrell> thornofmight: You could use localstorage to mark certain files as loaded.
[06:52:05] <thornofmight> i only get the problem if i'm trying to load the same file that's already there
[06:52:18] <thornofmight> like if the user tries to click on an option that's already selected
[06:52:30] <thornofmight> and it reloads the specified file
[06:52:39] <thornofmight> but it's the same file that's already loaded
[06:53:30] <jonathancutrell> thornofmight: There's not really a hit for that if its cached, so replace the existing one with itself.
[06:53:40] <jonathancutrell> thornofmight: You can also check the url of the image.
[06:57:36] <seutje> KOTRET: I don't think calling trigger('click') on a link will execute native events (like following the href)
[06:59:26] <codeAssassin> indeed .click() or trigget('click') simply fires the onclick event, not anything that is related directly to a hyperlink
[07:00:23] <KOTRET> ah okay
[07:00:39] <KOTRET> BUT ^^
[07:00:56] <KOTRET> if i dont use window.location in the click handler, the link will not get executed too
[07:01:29] <KOTRET> and i did not "event.preventDefault();"
[07:01:35] <KOTRET> or return false etc
[07:01:46] <KOTRET> do i need to return something special?
[07:03:20] <codeAssassin> can you fiddle your code ?
[07:03:44] <KOTRET> ill review it again, im a bit confused now X(
[07:17:08] <Shucky> hi all
[07:18:39] <Shucky> i have this code
[07:18:40] <Shucky> http://pastebin.com/3f5M5QhW
[07:18:54] <Shucky> it works FF Chrome Safari etc etc
[07:19:00] <Shucky> on IE9
[07:19:12] <Shucky> but how can i do this on IE < 9
[07:19:21] <Woet> not use html5?
[07:19:53] <Shucky> how can i do this whitout html5
[07:19:54] <KOTRET> codeAssassin: i would need to distict between normal link click, or tr-click(then window.location)... works as expected, i was confused %)
[07:19:58] <Woet> Shucky: flash
[07:20:20] <Shucky> seriously? this is no way to do this whitout flash?
[07:20:50] <Woet> Shucky: on browsers without the HTML5 audio tag, I don't believe there is an alternative for playing mp3
[07:20:59] <Shucky> :'(
[07:21:13] <Shucky> you break my heart :(
[07:21:25] <Woet> try http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_sounds.asp
[07:21:40] <Woet> such as embed/object
[07:21:54] <Woet> at the bottom you have HTML that will use HTML 5 and fall back to embed if it fails
[07:22:33] <LordThumper> Hi. jQuery doesn't seem to create event.preventDefault object in IE9
[07:22:36] <LordThumper> Is this normal?
[07:22:37] <codeAssassin> Shucky: <bgsound src="/something.mp3" loop="1" autostart="autostart">
[07:23:03] <LordThumper> Doesn't jQuery modify the event object?
[07:23:04] <codeAssassin> Shucky: i believe you can use the bgsound tag in IE. im on a mac, so i cant try it out for you
[07:23:51] <Shucky> codeAssassin i can use bgsound but i don't want do play sound on page load but on click on button
[07:24:05] <evasivx> Hey, can someone take a look at the navigation on this website, roll over it a few time and see if you know the reason, very small script: http://projectomni.com/cowtown/clothing/clothing
[07:24:16] <codeAssassin> Shucky: you can insert that tag after clicking on a button ;)
[07:24:25] <codeAssassin> Shucky: let jquery insert it
[07:25:19] <Shucky> yes when i write my answer i thought to this solution i'm going to try
[07:25:20] <Shucky> thx
[07:26:18] <codeAssassin> Shucky: yw bro, if this fails you can always try to generate embed objects, but thats a mess (although less of a mess then flash)
[07:33:12] <djsounds02> Hi
[07:33:22] <djsounds02> document.getElementById("vix_theme_options[upload_image]")  How do I implent this line into jQuery('irc://irc.freenode.net/#upload_image_button').click(function() {
[07:33:56] <JaredCE> hi all, i'm running on jQuery 1.7.1 and having an issue with http://pastebin.com/x6HcKP69 i see a response coming back in firebug but the success alert never gets fired
[07:35:04] <djsounds02> obviously without the irc link in the middle of it lol
[07:35:08] <QueueQueue> @JaredCE did you inspect the request to see what it contained?
[07:35:12] <QueueQueue> **response
[07:36:11] <ScottG> Man, chrome really doens't seem to like hide()...
[07:37:21] <JaredCE> QueueQueue: trying that now
[07:42:43] <djsounds02> jQuery(document).getElementById("vix_theme_options[upload_image_button]").click(function() {     Whats wrong with this line?
[07:43:28] <BillCriswell> djsounds02: Assuming that's not an ID.
[07:43:55] <djsounds02> it is
[07:44:22] <NoiseEee> djsounds02: why are you trying to use getElementByID (note the case) ?!?
[07:44:35] <BillCriswell> djsounds02: The button has id="vix_theme_options[upload_image_button]" on it?
[07:44:37] <djsounds02> i was told thats the best way>
[07:44:38] <NoiseEee> $('#vix_theme_options[upload_image_button]')
[07:44:40] <BillCriswell> Sure it's not the name of it?
[07:44:52] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell has a major point
[07:44:53] <djsounds02> BillCriswell: yes thats the id
[07:44:54] <NoiseEee> :P
[07:45:04] <greek> Hi fellas. How do I change my <select> menu's currently selected option to the next available option in the list?
[07:45:11] <NoiseEee> djsounds02: are you familiar with javascript?
[07:45:13] <BillCriswell> Oh... then NoiseEee has your answer.
[07:45:20] <djsounds02> NoiseEee: not at all sorry
[07:46:28] <djsounds02> something I keep meaning to learn but get so bogged down
[07:46:40] <djsounds02> everytime I ask a question and get the answer though I do understand it more
[07:49:08] <djsounds02> NoiseEee: What do youthink then bud?
[07:50:42] <NoiseEee> $('#vix_theme_options[upload_image_button]') is your id djsounds02
[07:50:49] <NoiseEee> s/id/element
[07:51:09] <NoiseEee> as far as helping, i'm not your man sorry.
[07:54:11] <djsounds02> I dont get what your saying at all :(
[07:55:36] <_archer_> djsounds02 - what are you trying to do with document.getElementById("vix_theme_options[upload_image]") ?
[07:55:58] <diverdude> How do you guys usually do l10n of strings written in js files?
[07:56:25] <djsounds02> _archer_: this is my HTML line <input id="vix_theme_options[upload_image_button]" type="button" value="Upload Image" />
[07:56:41] <djsounds02> _archer_: It loads a jquery wordpress upload interface
[07:57:20] <djsounds02> _archer_: that id doesnt have to have the square brackets.. but my value does
[07:58:12] <djsounds02> _archer_: This is the box that the results get shown at... <input id="vix_theme_options[upload_image]" type="text" size="36" name="vix_theme_options[upload_image]" value="<?php esc_attr_e( $options['upload_image'] ); ?>" />
[07:58:53] <JaredCE> every girl loves a bit of github
[07:59:05] <JaredCE> wrong window
[07:59:20] <JaredCE> QueueQueue: wait, how do i go about inspecting the response,
[07:59:32] <djsounds02> _archer_: http://pastebin.com/wy5sR0UR here is all my Jquery
[07:59:37] <hishi[Wrk]> if i have a ul sibling to a "a" element. cant i target the ul by using $(this).siblings('ul') then?
[08:00:00] <hishi[Wrk]> if the a element have a mouseover trigger
[08:00:42] <quicksilver> hishi[Wrk]: you can't have a UL sibling to an A element.
[08:00:50] <quicksilver> oh yes you can.
[08:00:56] <hishi[Wrk]> hehe okej >_<
[08:00:56] <quicksilver> sorry, was thinking of LI
[08:01:02] <quicksilver> yes, that would work fine.
[08:01:28] <NoiseEee> djsounds02: its just that your stuff is so beyond incorrect / so clear that you have no idea what you're doing that you will probably not receive help
[08:01:29] <hishi[Wrk]> hum i cant get it to work
[08:01:30] <johnline> https://p.twimg.com/Avw0BNbCAAEZXV-.jpg
[08:01:41] <NoiseEee> there's a learning link around here djsounds02, maybe someone can type it so you can get up to speed.
[08:01:59] <NoiseEee> djsounds02: but essentially... you can't do something without knowing how to do something, you know what i mean/
[08:02:08] <NoiseEee> !learn
[08:02:16] <astropirate> Anyone looking for a freelance JS/Nodejs/jQuery developer? :)
[08:02:22] <QueueQueue> @JaredCE When you see the request you want in the net tab within firebug, you can expand it. You will then see sub tabs for "Headers, POST, Response, JSON, etc". When you click on the response tab you can see what is coming back in your response.
[08:02:28] <shoky> ?learn
[08:02:28] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[08:02:30] <shoky> ?101
[08:02:30] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[08:02:34] <NoiseEee> ty shoky
[08:02:43] <djsounds02> NoiseEee: Its just this one thing I need sorting :(
[08:02:45] <JaredCE> oh right
[08:03:09] <JaredCE> in my response i'm getting: <p>Your request is being handled and you will be emailed once your export is ready for download</p>
[08:03:10] <JaredCE>  which is what i'm expecting
[08:03:14] <raj> How is this function causing a reset of the timer with start=Date.now()? http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/LbjHV/5/
[08:03:16] <NoiseEee> djsounds02: its like someone bringing a car made out of popsicle sticks and saying 'i just need it to drive a block'.  anyways, good luck.
[08:03:22] <_archer_> djsounds02 - change the first line to jQuery("#vix_theme_options[upload_image_button]").click(function() {
[08:04:01] <djsounds02> _archer_: done
[08:04:03] <_archer_> djsounds02 - hold on - I'll do another pastebin for you
[08:04:18] <zackiv31> whats the best way to take an object a, lets say a = { 'B' : 1, 'C' : 2 } and to get the string "'B':'1','C':'2'"   kind of like a reverse eval?
[08:04:20] <djsounds02> _archer_ thankyou
[08:04:29] <mattsa> say i have an event delegated to some input element for when 'blur' occurs. is there any way to remove that element's parent (let's say an <li>) without triggering the blur event?
[08:04:42] <mattsa> because removing elements triggers blur =(
[08:04:58] <quicksilver> hishi[Wrk]: jsfiddle
[08:04:59] <QueueQueue> @JaredCE, what is your dataType defined for your ajax call?
[08:05:13] <shoky> raj what do you mean?
[08:05:29] <djsounds02> NoiseEee: Thanks for the links I will deffo bookmark them
[08:05:32] <JaredCE> ahh json, i'm apssing json through to my ajax and expecting html back
[08:05:41] <QueueQueue> Yep
[08:05:42] <QueueQueue> lol
[08:05:45] <raj> shoky, like how is pressing `start` the second time causing the timer to reset
[08:05:47] <raj> back to 0
[08:05:50] <quicksilver> mattsa: No. But you could remove the blur handler before you remove the element.
[08:05:59] <shoky> raj: well you're resetting the start timestamp..
[08:06:04] <QueueQueue> @JaredCE So what is is trying to do is deserialize it as a js object
[08:06:07] <raj> (it's the desired effect, but I didn't understand how it's happening)
[08:06:08] <mattsa> quicksilver: but… it's delegated ;_; so i'd just have to re-attach it right
[08:06:11] <_archer_> djsounds02 http://pastebin.com/KQE24W1w
[08:06:17] <_archer_> I don't know what you're trying to do with it
[08:06:18] <QueueQueue> @JardedCE try changing it to 'text'
[08:06:25] <shoky> raj cause your step function is dependant on 'start'
[08:06:33] <djsounds02> _archer_: do you need my html?
[08:06:42] <quicksilver> mattsa: you could make the handler itself check a variable you set to temoprarily disable it.
[08:06:51] <JaredCE> yeah that works, nice one QueueQueue
[08:06:53] <mattsa> quicksilver: yeah i'll go with that. thanks
[08:06:53] <quicksilver> mattsa: that's the thing about programming, so many ways to do it :)
[08:06:57] <raj> even after it starts?
[08:06:58] <mattsa> i know right?!
[08:07:05] <mattsa> =)
[08:07:10] <shoky> raj: every time its called..
[08:07:29] <djsounds02> _archer_: http://pastebin.com/gY8rAtgd
[08:07:45] <shoky> raj: you'd need a seperate start timestamp for each timer element if you want it .. seperate
[08:07:55] <shoky> raj: prolly easiest with .data
[08:08:12] <hishi[Wrk]> http://jsfiddle.net/vGjsd/ im sure its a simple error but what am i doing wrong?
[08:08:12] <raj> hmm
[08:08:36] <raj> I want timer2 to be unchanged by the clicking of any start button (after the initial start button starts it)
[08:08:48] <raj> but timer1 should reset back to 0 each time a start button is clicked
[08:08:49] <hishi[Wrk]> im simply trying to change the background color on ether submenu1 (when hovering menubtn1) or submenu2 (when hovering menubtn2)
[08:08:58] <raj> however, I'm not clear on why stepBinder is needed
[08:09:16] <raj> nor am I clear on what's causing the reset (you said by making start = Date.now())
[08:09:24] <raj> ...but why would that make it 0?
[08:09:35] <shoky> it would make the elapsed time 0
[08:09:42] <shoky> because you set the global start timestamp to right now
[08:09:49] <shoky> so, right now - right now == 0
[08:09:56] <raj> what's timestamp initially?
[08:10:02] <shoky> what?
[08:10:15] <raj> timestamp - start
[08:10:28] <shoky> it's set each time step is called
[08:10:44] <raj> so is timestamp the same as Date.now() ? except provided by requestAnimationFrame()?
[08:10:49] <_archer_> djsounds02 - can you just tell me what's wrong with the javascript?
[08:10:51] <shoky> yeah i think so
[08:11:26] <raj> i'm surprised this counter is so difficult
[08:11:44] <shoky> hmm it's not, i don't really see the need for requestanimationframe here
[08:11:53] <shoky> if you just want a seconds-timer
[08:12:16] <shoky> i'd just use setTimeout
[08:12:20] <djsounds02> _archer_: it doesnt respond when I press the button to open the jquery dialog.. also I can change the id for the button to get the dialog to appear but then the field I need pulling from the dialog cant get pulled I expect because of the [  ] brackets which is why I was using the .getElementById
[08:12:37] <shoky> (and of course check the current timestamp, not depend on setTimeout to be precise)
[08:12:55] <quicksilver> hishi[Wrk]: (1) it's $(this) not this
[08:13:00] <quicksilver> hishi[Wrk]: (2) it's siblings not sibling
[08:13:04] <djsounds02> _archer_ [  ] need to be there though as they are part of how the settings work
[08:13:16] <quicksilver> hishi[Wrk]: http://jsfiddle.net/vGjsd/1/
[08:13:32] <quicksilver> hishi[Wrk]: but my version still requires you to click, not just mouseover, and that part I don't understand
[08:13:34] <hishi[Wrk]> arg i thougth i tried that >_< ohwell thans aloty
[08:14:23] <raj> shoky, requestanimationframe was cuz it's more accurate/reliable or something
[08:14:32] <raj> and doesn't change speed with browser/tab focus
[08:14:40] <_archer_> djsounds02 - jQuery("#ID") get's you a jQuery object with the given ID - if you're not using jQuery for anything else then simply don't use it and stick with pure javascript.
[08:14:44] <shoky> yea but you're not doing any animation
[08:14:52] <shoky> and you don't need precision of the timer
[08:15:08] <_archer_> and I never said to remove the square brackets :confused:
[08:15:11] <raj> i do need timer precision!
[08:15:15] <raj> :)
[08:16:23] <raj> why is there NO jquery timer plugin that uses requestanimationframe?
[08:16:35] <shoky> you dont need timer precision
[08:16:36] <djsounds02> _archer_: well the pastebin you have sent me doesnt work, you have reverted it back to what I originally started with
[08:16:48] <shoky> you just need the timestamps you're getting with Date.now() to be precise
[08:16:48] <raj> shoky, are you attempting some voodoo?
[08:16:49] <shoky> and they are
[08:16:54] <shoky> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/LbjHV/6/
[08:17:32] <djsounds02> I then tried ('[id="foo[bar]"]'  but that didn't work either.. _archer_
[08:17:38] <shoky> you dont need to care that if you do setTimeout(fn, 650)   then it might not be exactly 650ms
[08:17:52] <shoky> because you can just check Date.now() inside
[08:18:16] <raj> hmm
[08:18:40] <raj> well, I'm $.posting when `start` is clicked so I can get a timestamp saved on the server
[08:18:45] <shoky> (in the fiddle all i did was addd a second start timestamp)
[08:18:49] <raj> but for the user, I need them to see a uniform/smooth timer
[08:19:43] <hishi[Wrk]> How can i get the submenu2 element persist when i mouseover both menubtn2 and the element itself (submenu2) http://jsfiddle.net/vGjsd/
[08:20:18] <shoky> raj put a console.log('step')  inside your step function
[08:20:25] <shoky> and see how much its called
[08:20:30] <shoky> tons of times per second
[08:20:31] <raj> k
[08:20:33] <shoky> you dont need that at all
[08:20:38] <raj> oh
[08:21:58] <raj> but what about my concern about keeping the timer count uniform?
[08:22:19] <shoky> hm what do yuou mean?
[08:22:23] <shoky> uniform?
[08:23:22] <raj> like, so 1 second is truly 1 second
[08:23:36] <raj> and doesn't go faster or slower depending on cpu usage and window focus, etc
[08:23:59] <rroelofs> If you want accurate tie you have to ask the browser each time
[08:24:16] <shoky> raj Date.now() is precise
[08:24:24] <raj> but is the counting up precise?
[08:24:29] <muscular> can: queryselectorall select at same precision as jQuery selector?
[08:24:34] <shoky> counting up?
[08:24:44] <rroelofs> raj, no setInterval is not precice
[08:24:45] <raj> like add 1 add 1 add 1 add 1 (for the seconds)
[08:24:56] <shoky> it doesnt add 1 a
[08:24:56] <silverwind> muscular, the jQuery selector API is based of the DOM Selector API...
[08:25:01] <_archer_> djsounds02 - sorry, but I really don't know what you are trying to do or what problem you are trying to resolve.  I can't help if I don't understand.  Do you have a url to the actual page itself, and a description of what's actually wrong?
[08:25:02] <shoky> raj you're not adding anything
[08:25:05] <silverwind> muscular, it only has some stupid extensions.
[08:25:09] <shoky> you're re-calcualting the time interval each time
[08:25:19] <shoky> based on 2 precise timestamps
[08:25:21] <djsounds02> _archer_: can I pm you?
[08:25:31] <muscular> great! thanks
[08:25:45] <_archer_> djsounds02 - yeah, that's fine
[08:26:15] <steveccc__> can i confirm you can do a selector with a class and change all elements with that class or can you only do this using the element ie img or an ID?
[08:26:30] <shoky> raj i didnt mean you should use setTimeout(fn, 1000)  btw
[08:26:41] <shoky> smaller timeouts
[08:28:13] <raj> shoky, so what's the reason this previous functoin was recommended before?
[08:28:21] <raj> on the pretense that it was "more accurate"
[08:29:09] <shoky> i dont see what's more accurate about it
[08:29:26] <shoky> the timestamps are the precise in any case
[08:29:41] <raj> hmm k
[08:29:46] <shoky> i guess,
[08:29:49] <raj> i see what you mean
[08:30:07] <raj> oh, I think the issue was it'll call the timestamp liesurely
[08:30:10] <raj> something like that
[08:30:20] <shoky> it only matters if you want to really make sure that if the user is actually counting the milliseconds passed between when the 1 turns into a 2 in the webpage
[08:30:31] * muscular salutes shoky & raj!
[08:30:33] <shoky> then using requestanimationframe, it'll be more precise...
[08:30:46] <shoky> but for a simple timer you really dont need that
[08:42:11] <raj> shoky, cuz it's overkill?
[08:42:25] <shoky> yea, seems so to me
[08:42:31] <raj> i'm seeing precision issues with requestwithanimation
[08:42:33] <raj> online
[08:42:38] <shoky> hmm
[08:42:41] <raj> on stackoverflow
[08:43:05] <shoky> with the timestamp it provides?
[08:44:28] <RohanBhangui> $(window).resize(function() {
[08:44:40] <RohanBhangui> does the js file automatically heck for that
[08:44:42] <RohanBhangui> constantly
[08:44:56] <RohanBhangui> or is it a one time invoked function unless called otherwise
[08:45:24] <shoky> RohanBhangui: it registers an event handler for the resize event..
[08:45:45] <RohanBhangui> so it keeps checking whether the browser size has been reset?
[08:45:51] <RohanBhangui> reset mean resized
[08:45:53] <shoky> no
[08:46:08] <shoky> when the window is resized, the browser calls the registered event handler
[08:46:45] <RohanBhangui> so how can i get the js file configuredso as to get the broser size checked constantly
[08:47:31] <DeltaHeavy> If I'm changing a background image via psudo-CSS should I use jQuery's .load? What if I'm changing the 'src' attribute with .hover? Should I use .load then?
[08:47:34] <shoky> if the resize handler wasn't called, then most likely the browser size hasn't changed...
[08:48:14] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: what pseudo-css ?
[08:48:42] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: eg, .someclass:hover, -OR- .someclass:focus
[08:48:43] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: why .load?  ask just one question please..
[08:48:53] <DeltaHeavy> Sorry if I used the wrong terminology, let me ocmpletely rephrase my question
[08:49:21] <DeltaHeavy> Should I be pre-loading any images? If so under what circumstances and how,
[08:49:41] <shoky> pre-loading them for what..
[08:51:09] <shoky> hmm
[08:51:50] <diverdude> Hello, how can i make a cross in the upper part of an image, so that when i press it, the image is removed?
[08:52:28] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: eg, I have a .hover event. The image when mouseover is active for .hover
[08:53:14] <LordThumper> I am adding a dynamic link and wrapping it on a table element.
[08:53:17] <shoky> DeltaHeavy i suppose you should pre-load yeah.
[08:53:23] <LordThumper> Why would this link work in Chrome, but not in IE9?
[08:54:18] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Is using .load the preferred method of doing this?
[08:55:03] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: yeah if you have an image element, for example: http://jsfiddle.net/3Czka/
[08:55:25] <diverdude> how can i make a cross in the upper part of an image, so that when i press it, the image is removed?
[08:55:28] <LordThumper> If I bind a click event handler to the link, it fires
[08:55:33] <LordThumper> But the link is not followed
[08:55:35] <LordThumper> This is strange
[08:55:50] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: well you only need to use .load if you want to know when the image has laoded
[08:56:19] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/dqNqD/4/
[08:56:29] <RohanBhangui> rpoblem is described in js file
[08:57:59] <shoky> RohanBhangui it works fine: http://jsfiddle.net/dqNqD/5/   (look at your console)
[08:58:25] <raj> shoky, http://nie-wieder.net/metronom/test.html#
[08:58:35] <raj> if you switch tabs while this is running, you'll see what I mean
[08:59:12] <RohanBhangui> shoky
[08:59:33] <shoky> raj: yea requestanimationframe doesnt get called when youre not on the page..
[08:59:41] <RohanBhangui> im trying to get the window size in px  and output 10% of that value to the propety left for categories li
[09:00:23] <shoky> RohanBhangui:  .css('left', leftproperty + 'px' )
[09:00:35] <RohanBhangui> shoky: right
[09:00:35] <shoky> er
[09:00:42] <shoky> no its a float
[09:01:04] <shoky> .css('left', Math.round(leftproperty) + 'px' )
[09:01:22] <raj> shoky, yeah, so that's garbage to me then!
[09:01:23] <raj> basura
[09:01:25] <Multiply> Why not just use 10% width?
[09:01:31] <RohanBhangui> cant
[09:01:34] <RohanBhangui> jquery
[09:01:38] <RohanBhangui> doesnt read %
[09:01:57] <Multiply> No, I mean, in your css. Why not just 10%?
[09:02:04] <RohanBhangui> i now
[09:02:07] <RohanBhangui> know
[09:02:12] <RohanBhangui> when i use that it comes out weird
[09:02:17] <RohanBhangui> when i run the animation
[09:02:20] <RohanBhangui> so what im trying to do
[09:02:21] <raj> shoky, actually, that doesn't use requestwithanimation, I don't think
[09:02:29] <RohanBhangui> is ge tthe width of the window
[09:02:46] <shoky> raj screw requestanimationframe. you're not animating anything
[09:02:48] <RohanBhangui> take 10% of that value and out put that 10% of the value to the left property
[09:02:54] <RohanBhangui> but im having prouble doing that
[09:03:31] <shoky> raj hm yea its using setTimeout
[09:03:41] <RohanBhangui> shoky still not working
[09:03:41] <diverdude> is it possible to inspect pixelvalues of specific pixels of an image using jquery?
[09:03:49] <RohanBhangui> uploading new jsfiddle
[09:04:06] <danheberden> diverdude: you could put that image data into a canvas
[09:04:13] <danheberden> and then use that to get the pixel data
[09:04:17] <danheberden> jQuery itself? no
[09:04:19] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/dqNqD/7/
[09:04:39] <shoky> raj its using animation for the visual metronome shit and playing the sound on animation completion...
[09:05:09] <diverdude> danheberden: thats html5 only right?
[09:05:39] <RohanBhangui> shoky any ideas
[09:05:49] <danheberden> caniuse canvas
[09:05:49] <caniuse> danheberden: You can use Canvas (basic support) with Internet Explorer 9, Firefox 2, Chrome 4, Safari 3.1, Opera 9, iOS Safari 3.2, and Opera Mobile 10. http://caniuse.com/#search=canvas

[09:07:21] <RohanBhangui> why the window resize isnt working tried your solution
[09:07:25] <RohanBhangui> still no avail
[09:07:30] <NoelB> Hi folks.  Is it possible to delegate a scroll event to an unordered list (which has overflow: auto) ?  I am using $(document).on("scroll","ul.items",function(e) { } ); but it does not fire properly.
[09:08:37] <shoky> RohanBhangui it works, but only when you resize the window (in jsfiddle you need to resize the frame)
[09:08:46] <NoelB> Also tried using $(window) but to no avail
[09:09:02] <RohanBhangui> when i use a browser window it doesnt work
[09:09:12] <NoelB> trying to avoud the old $('#list').scroll() because I have a few scrollable lists going on at once.
[09:09:33] <GoGoGarrett>  Is there anyway to send a string as a method?  example.  something.send("length")
[09:09:47] <NoiseEee> RohanBhangui: iirc browsers stopped letting scripts adjust the size of the window by themselves, but whatever opened the window can adjust the size.
[09:09:49] <lost123> hi
[09:10:18] <RohanBhangui> dont quite understand
[09:10:27] <shoky> RohanBhangui thats why i said resize the frame
[09:10:30] <shoky> RohanBhangui: http://jsfiddle.net/dqNqD/9/
[09:10:56] <RohanBhangui> oops sry didnt update css
[09:11:11] <lost123> how can i call the function after first five slides of slideshow have slided,i am using http://www.jquerytools.org/documentation/tabs/slideshow.html
[09:12:21] <lost123> http://pastie.org/4121223 i want to call the function nextfive() after slides, this functions makes an ajax call
[09:12:51] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/dqNqD/11/
[09:12:55] <RohanBhangui> still doesnt wokr
[09:13:06] <RohanBhangui> links go all over the place when i resize browser
[09:13:06] <raj> shoky, ok, so your way doesn't use setTimeout at all?
[09:13:11] <shoky> RohanBhangui its working...
[09:13:22] <RohanBhangui> try resizing and it wont work
[09:13:24] <RohanBhangui> watch
[09:13:40] <shoky> working fine
[09:13:47] <karl_heinz> hi, I'm using validationEngine which validates fields before submits. I want to disable this when the 'previous' submit button is clicked. What's a better way than using onclick="removeValidation();" ?
[09:13:48] <shoky> raj, my way?
[09:13:59] <raj> yes, the Uri method
[09:14:04] <shoky> raj i'd use setTimeout ;p
[09:14:14] <raj> damnit, we see the issue with that!
[09:14:19] <shoky> what??
[09:14:23] <raj> with the metronome
[09:14:27] <shoky> noo
[09:14:31] <shoky> i wrote u
[09:14:36] <LordThumper> Finally managed to replicate the problem
[09:14:42] <shoky> <shoky> raj its using animation for the visual metronome shit and playing the sound on animation completion...
[09:14:43] <LordThumper> Why does this work in Chrome, but not in IE9?
[09:14:43] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/HhUrX/1/
[09:14:48] <RohanBhangui> go into the full preview mode and then make the browser smaller
[09:14:51] <RohanBhangui> youll see what i mean
[09:14:52] <lost123> anyone? http://pastie.org/4121223
[09:14:56] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/dqNqD/12/
[09:15:03] <raj> what does animation use?
[09:15:11] <raj> (not setTimeout)?
[09:15:29] <nlistana> hi all hope I don't bother, but can anyone explain what Class.create() does? Or where can I find more info about it?
[09:15:33] <shoky> raj i dunno , but just cause that shit happened on that metronome.. doesnt mean shit ;p
[09:15:36] <LordThumper> Could that be a bug in jQuery?
[09:15:44] <LordThumper> Or am I doing something wrong
[09:16:25] <shoky> LordThumper you're appending a <td> to a <table>
[09:16:25] <ajpiano> LordThumper:  that tries to add a td directly to <table> for one
[09:16:28] <shoky> ;P
[09:16:28] <ajpiano> that whole thing looks crazy
[09:16:40] <ajpiano> LordThumper: just build up a string and do a single append
[09:16:48] <track0x1> does jquery have a feature where it automatically adjusts the background of a webpage when a scrollbar appears?
[09:17:09] <LordThumper> Oh append doesn't return the appended string?
[09:17:28] <LordThumper> I see... would have never seen this alone... thanks alot
[09:18:40] <LordThumper> Yes that fixed that problem :)
[09:18:52] <LordThumper> Chrome must have fixed the invalid markup, that is my it worked
[09:18:59] <LordThumper> Thanks alot, again
[09:19:05] <LordThumper> why*
[09:19:35] <yango> what would be the best way to see why not all the $.ajax requests arrive to the server? The client and the server run in the same machine, so no network issue
[09:19:56] <raj> how the eff doesn't this exist http://www.jqueryrain.com/2011/11/14-best-jquery-clock-tutorials-both-analog-and-digital-clocks/
[09:20:19] <shoky> RohanBhangui it seems fine to me..
[09:20:33] <NoiseEee> yango: are you sure they're even sent?
[09:20:49] <NoiseEee> yango: what error messages do your xhr calls return?
[09:21:01] <shoky> raj what's 'this' ?
[09:22:26] <ogk1000> is there a hasId like hasClass
[09:22:30] <yango> NoiseEee: that's the problem, they return no error (I have an alert on the error: attribute) but they don't arrive to the server, and the code should be run... The thing is that it's a request per every 5 or so keypresses, so if I put a debugger the behavior changes
[09:22:52] <yango> and the problem occurrs only when I press lots of keys very quickly
[09:24:09] <shoky> ogk1000 there's only one id
[09:24:28] <shoky> ogk1000 there's .is()
[09:25:04] <ogk1000> this is what im trying to do http://collabedit.com/n6yys
[09:25:23] <NoiseEee> yango: jsfiddle it up and maybe someone can take a look
[09:25:33] <ogk1000> also is there a way on load with JS working it disregards default hash/anchor position
[09:26:26] <shoky> ogk1000:  .filter(hash)
[09:26:56] <shoky> er .filter('#' + clickTo)
[09:30:16] <shoky> ogk1000: var clickTo = window.location.hash;  $('#header a').filter(clickTo).click();
[09:30:49] <ogk1000> hmm dosnt work
[09:30:50] <raj> shoky, an accurate jquery timer
[09:31:13] <ogk1000> oh wait it does shoky so that stops default anchor action
[09:31:28] <ogk1000> how do I find a#THEHASHID
[09:31:30] <shoky> it doesnt stop anything
[09:31:44] <shoky> what
[09:32:15] <shoky> raj the only accuracy you need is 2 timestamps :\
[09:33:11] <shoky> and raj.. jquery is just javascript
[09:35:10] <raj> shoky, alright, guess I should stop fighting it since I haven't even tried
[09:35:42] <raj> actually, that fiddle you made for me is using 2 timestamps, no?
[09:36:21] <shoky> i just modified yours a bit
[09:36:28] <shoky> added another start timestamp
[09:36:30] <raj> yeah, that's what I mean
[09:36:39] <shoky> ah so yeah;p
[09:36:56] <raj> dude, we used to be on the same wavelength, what's going on!?
[09:37:16] <shoky> lawl
[09:37:31] <shoky> well i was talking about end and start timestamp
[09:37:38] <shoky> for accurate interval measurement
[09:37:48] <rethus> http://pastebin.com/SsWAV5MZ
[09:37:52] <shoky> and U sudenly switched to asking about 2 start timestamps
[09:38:00] <shoky> so.................. i dono
[09:38:14] <rethus> have this kind of object. how can i access to Object 76?
[09:38:18] <raj> i don't even know what I'm asking
[09:38:25] <raj> I just know the end result i want!
[09:38:31] <shoky> rethus huh
[09:39:01] <rethus> have a look at this page: http://fliesendiscount24.webseite-absichern.de/casalgrande-padana-granitoker-metallica-rame-1.html
[09:39:04] <_archer_> rethus - from that all I can suggest is spConfig.config.attributes.76
[09:39:14] <rethus> open firebug, and show spConfig
[09:39:16] <shoky> rethus spConfig.config.attributes[76] i guess
[09:39:17] <shoky> ah
[09:39:39] <LordThumper> And now jsfiddle is not working in IE9.. this is so confusing
[09:39:52] <LordThumper> The html/css/js tabs are not focused when clicked
[09:39:59] <LordThumper> No addons
[09:40:07] <shoky> LordThumper what fiddle
[09:40:15] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/
[09:40:19] <LordThumper> The website
[09:40:22] <LordThumper> Not working correctly
[09:40:23] <_archer_> rethus - as per shoky
[09:40:26] <rethus> shoky: on 76 i have "options > n objects and inside of each obhject id: 1065 (ffor example)
[09:40:48] <shoky> wat...
[09:41:17] <rethus> please open the page i send above... type in firebug spConfig and enter
[09:41:27] <NoiseEee> rethus: try pasting the console.log output proper
[09:41:33] <rethus> than move down to 76 > options > = > id
[09:41:44] <shoky> rethus your paste is not readable
[09:42:04] <_archer_> rethus - just use them like collections - spConfig.config.attributes[76].options[1].label
[09:42:16] <rethus> therefor i tell you the link. esayer to see it directly in firebug
[09:42:31] <rethus> yes, but what if 76 and 1 are not known
[09:42:42] <shoky> then choose a random number, obviously
[09:43:06] <rethus> i know the "label"
[09:43:17] <rethus> but not the path till there
[09:44:04] <shoky> then you need to rethink your object tree structure i guess..
[09:44:09] <rethus> you see it in firebug
[09:44:14] <shoky> or.. search till you find that label.
[09:44:19] <shoky> sounds fun
[09:44:23] <rethus> its not my, its a result-collection of magento-shop
[09:44:34] <shoky> you're asking, so its yours ;p
[09:44:54] <diverdude> how do i overlay an icon on an image
[09:45:14] <rethus> is there something like searchObj. which may find my value and give me my searchd "id:" label?
[09:45:32] <LordThumper> ajpiano: I updated my code and it is still not working
[09:45:33] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/HhUrX/4/
[09:45:51] <LordThumper> If someone solves this, they can have my eternal gratitude
[09:45:57] <shoky> rethus no.. you want it to just search ALL your object properties ??
[09:46:07] <LordThumper> Cannot see why it is working in Chrome but not in IE9
[09:46:28] <shoky> LordThumper </tr/>
[09:46:30] <rethus> cause IE sucks ;)
[09:47:00] <LordThumper> Fixed
[09:47:01] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/HhUrX/6/
[09:47:12] <rethus> afk
[09:47:16] <LordThumper> Still not working
[09:47:41] <shoky> my guess would be the .contents()
[09:48:17] <raj> if I do `var hello='hi'; $('button').on('click', somefunc);` does somefunc have access to `hello`?
[09:48:33] <LordThumper> Mmm
[09:48:47] <LordThumper> It is being replaced, but the link is not working
[09:48:56] <LordThumper> Even if I wrap AFTER attaching to the DOM
[09:48:56] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/HhUrX/7/
[09:49:13] <shoky> raj:  var hello='hi';  function somefunc() { .... }
[09:49:29] <shoky> raj: then it has access to hello. irregardless of where you reference it
[09:49:55] <LordThumper> What can I use instead of .contents() ?
[09:50:12] <NoiseEee> ?learn @ raj
[09:50:25] <raj> ?screw you @ NoiseEee
[09:50:35] <NoiseEee> raj, your questions are basic JS scope questions.
[09:50:55] <djsounds02> NoiseEee: me and archer got it fixed but I just wondered if you could give me a very easy answer?
[09:51:09] <shoky> LordThumper: http://jsfiddle.net/HhUrX/8/
[09:51:11] <raj> what about `var hello='hi'; $('button').on('click', function(){/* some stuff */})
[09:51:14] <raj> `
[09:51:23] <raj> yeah, and my question is whether that counts as a parent scope
[09:51:42] <raj> a function should have access to the variables of its parent function
[09:52:04] <shoky> yeah it'll have access
[09:52:11] <NodeX> why not put it in fiddle and try it
[09:52:16] <NodeX> it takes 2 seconds
[09:52:16] <raj> shoky, but my first way wouldn't?
[09:52:28] <shoky> raj your first way didnt specify where somefunc is defined
[09:52:31] <LordThumper> Nice shoky
[09:52:35] <raj> ah
[09:52:51] <raj> so that's what made the difference?
[09:52:57] <shoky> what difference ;)
[09:53:07] <raj> cuz I had the function just sitting out at the global scope
[09:53:27] <raj> shoky, difference that my first way wouldn't have access to `hello`, yet the other way would
[09:53:46] <shoky> if var hello='hi' was also global...
[09:53:48] <shoky> then it would
[09:54:51] <shoky> with proper indentation all scope confusion goes away
[09:55:13] <shoky> in javascript at least
[09:55:30] <astropirate> scope confusion will go away when all browsers support 'let'
[09:55:44] <astropirate> one can dream :(
[10:00:33] <raj> ok, so here it is http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/PhRHJ/
[10:00:59] <raj> ok, I see now
[10:01:09] <raj> basically in the non-working one, it's simply called from within that function
[10:01:12] <raj> but defined outside
[10:01:21] <raj> but the anon function is defined within, so it's got access
[10:01:26] <NodeX> PHP rocks - true story
[10:01:29] <raj> thank you, as usual, shoky :)
[10:04:30] <shoky> ;]
[10:06:19] <djsounds02> This is wrong how do I do it right? I got my first one working fine so duplicated it and changed the id's now they are getting confused.. lol

[10:07:56] <shoky> does it work?
[10:08:16] <djsounds02> erm I have 2 upload boxes.. when I upload to the forst box it puts the url in the second box
[10:08:40] <shoky> a jsfiddle would be x1000 better
[10:08:45] <djsounds02> ive checked all the ids.. there all correct
[10:08:55] <djsounds02> shoky: I cant its a wordpress file
[10:09:01] <shoky> you didnt answer any of my questions..
[10:09:08] <raj> haha
[10:09:52] <djsounds02> well ive told you what is wrong.. when I upload to the forst box it puts the url in the second box.. and im asking for help so no it doesnt work
[10:09:52] <shoky> ah raj no i havent tried suits yet
[10:10:03] <shoky> i'm watching mad men now
[10:10:17] <shoky> finally got into it after trying a few times
[10:10:25] <shoky> i'll try suits soon
[10:10:42] <shoky> djsounds02 what is wrong about that
[10:10:44] <raj> mad men is good
[10:10:56] <raj> just got tired after like 4, 5 seasons
[10:11:03] <djsounds02> when I upload using the top box I expect the url to go into the top box and not the second box
[10:11:06] <shoky> im in 3rd now
[10:11:46] <shoky> djsounds02 i have no idea what you're talking about
[10:11:47] <RohanBhangui> >	http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/dqNqD/12/
[10:11:54] <RohanBhangui> any help with browser resizing
[10:12:16] <shoky> RohanBhangui ask a question
[10:12:24] <RohanBhangui> alright
[10:12:56] <djsounds02> shoky.. I have 2 upload buttons with textfields next to each.. when I upload the url should go into the text field.. it doesnt it goes into the second text field
[10:13:30] <djsounds02> shoky: http://cl.ly/0d2p0i0d390m1A3v3Z1f
[10:13:34] <RohanBhangui> when i resize my browser whle my elements are open they get compressed one on top of each other
[10:15:06] <shoky> djsounds02: isolate your problem and make a jsfiddle demonstrating the issue. its impossible to help you with what you've provided
[10:15:29] <djsounds02> jsfiddle cant handle wordpress
[10:15:33] <shoky> fuck wordpress
[10:15:44] <shoky> html and javascript
[10:16:01] <shoky> wordpress is serverside
[10:16:54] <djsounds02> well its an issue with an admin screen not a front page :/
[10:17:12] <shoky> RohanBhangui: yes because you're setting all their positions to 0.4 of the window width..
[10:17:22] <RohanBhangui> thats the initla postion
[10:17:33] <shoky> not just initial
[10:17:37] <shoky> on every resize too.
[10:17:47] <RohanBhangui> what i want to do is right this postion to the left and top properties of the categories li
[10:17:56] <RohanBhangui> every resize
[10:18:19] <RohanBhangui> becuase im doing it based on angles and distance
[10:18:29] <RohanBhangui> so the angle and distance is relative to the start point
[10:18:32] <RohanBhangui> or initial point
[10:18:34] <RohanBhangui> the logic
[10:18:40] <shoky> go for it
[10:18:45] <RohanBhangui> is as the browser size changes the iniital opint will also change
[10:18:46] <shoky> logic is key.
[10:18:52] <RohanBhangui> there by changing the final points for the items
[10:19:10] <RohanBhangui> logic is fine but when i code it
[10:19:13] <RohanBhangui> it doesnt come out right
[10:19:14] <shoky> RohanBhangui: anyway, right now you're setting them all to 0.4 of the window width
[10:19:22] <shoky> that is not the logic you are looking for, so change it
[10:19:33] <RohanBhangui> but you understand why im using 0.4
[10:19:35] <RohanBhangui> right?
[10:19:58] <shoky> i dont even know how to answer that
[10:20:09] <RohanBhangui> okay
[10:20:14] <shoky> because its a magical number?
[10:20:20] <RohanBhangui> let me explain from the beginning
[10:20:25] <RohanBhangui> if you look at my css
[10:20:25] <shoky> ;S
[10:20:32] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/dqNqD/12/
[10:20:35] <RohanBhangui> then you will see
[10:20:43] <RohanBhangui> that #show
[10:20:49] <RohanBhangui> has a margin left of 40%
[10:20:58] <shoky> k
[10:21:03] <RohanBhangui> that means it has a .4 margin left
[10:21:07] <RohanBhangui> .4 of the screen size
[10:21:09] <shoky> k
[10:21:18] <RohanBhangui> now my categories li
[10:21:22] <shoky> so i  understand the 0.4 yes..
[10:21:26] <RohanBhangui> has a position of top: 16px
[10:21:32] <shoky> i can see your code dude
[10:21:37] <shoky> you dont have to repeat it to me
[10:21:39] <RohanBhangui> okay
[10:21:40] <RohanBhangui> sry
[10:21:42] <RohanBhangui> but ya
[10:21:51] <RohanBhangui> so i want the initla postion to be .4 of the screen as well
[10:21:59] <RohanBhangui> but when i am done the reveal animation
[10:22:10] <shoky> then you dont want 0.4
[10:22:15] <RohanBhangui> then i try to scale browser they come out  on top of each other
[10:22:23] <RohanBhangui> how should i be scalling then
[10:22:27] <shoky> because youre still setting to 0.4 ..
[10:22:37] <shoky> man, its some basic math, work it out :\
[10:22:45] <shoky> on a piece of paper
[10:22:52] <RohanBhangui> im taking .4 of the screen and writing that value to the left property
[10:23:01] <RohanBhangui> but it doesnt seem to be writing
[10:23:07] <shoky> it is......
[10:23:16] <shoky> they all move to .4
[10:23:25] <RohanBhangui> when i vie wthe left property it is still zero (default
[10:23:58] <shoky> no, its not
[10:24:20] <shoky> its 40% of the window width
[10:24:26] <shoky> as you've set it.
[10:24:34] <RohanBhangui> how can i get it to write that value to the css
[10:24:38] <shoky> what value
[10:24:39] <RohanBhangui> cause i am readignt aht same value
[10:24:43] <RohanBhangui> the elft : alue
[10:24:49] <RohanBhangui> *left:
[10:24:50] <shoky> ?
[10:25:33] <RohanBhangui> #categories li {
[10:25:35] <RohanBhangui>   top: 16px;'
[10:25:37] <RohanBhangui>   left: 0px;   <----------------------this remains 0 even when i check in console
[10:25:38] <RohanBhangui>   position: absolute;
[10:25:40] <RohanBhangui>   text-decoration: none;
[10:25:41] <shoky> in console?
[10:25:41] <RohanBhangui> }
[10:25:48] <shoky> how are you checking it in console
[10:25:51] <RohanBhangui> chrome console
[10:25:53] <enapupe> Hello, I'm looking for a jquery based simple upload sistem, any suggestion?
[10:26:02] <shoky> yes, how
[10:26:19] <Danwe_WMDE> whats the most reliable way to find out wether a object is a jQuery.Deferred ?
[10:26:35] <danheberden> Danwe_WMDE: check for .promise
[10:26:37] <RohanBhangui> @enapupe
[10:26:39] <RohanBhangui> http://mathandprogramming.blogspot.ca/2010/12/uploading-file-with-jquery.html
[10:26:49] <RohanBhangui> right click on page view e;ement
[10:26:56] <RohanBhangui> inspect element
[10:27:22] <RohanBhangui> im doingthis not in jsfiddle but in a sperete browser
[10:27:26] <Danwe_WMDE> danheberden: and if I want to check for Deferred OR Promise?
[10:27:27] <RohanBhangui> *seperate
[10:27:42] <shoky> RohanBhangui: are you sure you're looking at the <li> element
[10:27:47] <shoky> and not the <a> thats inside ?
[10:27:52] <RohanBhangui> no
[10:28:03] <danheberden> Danwe_WMDE: aye
[10:28:07] <RohanBhangui> i need to write a value to the categories li left property
[10:28:25] <shoky> RohanBhangui for me it shows on the <li>:   element.style {
[10:28:25] <shoky> left: 469.8221983093764px;
[10:28:43] <RohanBhangui> how come it isnt working on mine
[10:28:47] <danheberden> Danwe_WMDE: however, that might be bad
[10:28:48] <Danwe_WMDE> danheberden: oh, Promise has .promise as well
[10:28:59] <Danwe_WMDE> why bad?
[10:29:02] <danheberden> because .promise is on the jQuery prototype
[10:29:10] <danheberden> since all jQ objects can be observable
[10:29:16] <danheberden> may or may not be bad for *you*
[10:29:19] <danheberden> but worth mentioning :D
[10:29:23] <shoky> RohanBhangui you're not looking at the right element probably..
[10:29:37] <RohanBhangui> oh ya i see that
[10:29:39] <RohanBhangui> i knwo what you
[10:29:41] <RohanBhangui> mean
[10:29:57] <RohanBhangui> but how come they come up stacked when the li elements are open
[10:30:02] <RohanBhangui> let me send you a csreenshot
[10:30:14] <shoky> because you are setting their left :\\\
[10:30:17] <shoky> to the same thing :\\\
[10:30:21] <shoky> dont you listen
[10:31:07] <Danwe_WMDE> thanks danheberden seems simple enough
[10:32:03] <JonathanNeal> If you guys have any input on a new article I'm writing about ancestorQuerySelectorAll / ancestorQuerySelector (a potential native equiv to jQuery's closest) I would really appreciate them http://www.jonathantneal.com/blog/faking-the-future/ pw: review
[10:34:28] <RohanBhangui> i still dont get it shoky
[10:34:35] <danheberden> JonathanNeal: could you make the name longer?
[10:34:38] <danheberden> :D
[10:34:52] <angrywombat_> setting the async prop in an $.ajax call is deprecated in 1.8... is there another option?
[10:35:01] <danheberden> allTheAncestorsQuerySelectorEverythingSeriously
[10:35:02] <Eviltwin> angrywombat_: Use async
[10:35:12] <JonathanNeal> ancestorQuerySelector is shorter than getElementsByClassName :P
[10:35:14] <Eviltwin> Not async: false
[10:35:41] <angrywombat_> Eviltwin: i'm not sure what you mean.. is async a function?
[10:36:22] <JonathanNeal> danheberden: were you around when we were discussing other names? It's the most fitting that adopts language from other JS. No one seemed keen on introducing latin, eg anteQuerySelector
[10:36:52] <danheberden> JonathanNeal: yeah, just being silly as usual
[10:38:19] <Eviltwin> angrywombat_: Do you know what asynchronous programming is?
[10:38:25] <shoky> angrywombat_: the other option is not to use async:false
[10:39:07] <angrywombat_> yes, meaning the browser waits for the query to return
[10:39:17] <angrywombat_> async: false is what is deprecated tho?
[10:39:20] <angrywombat_> maybe i misread
[10:39:23] <shoky> the browser, the user, the world
[10:39:24] <RohanBhangui> shoky
[10:39:42] <neumino> Is there still a memory leak in the last version of Jquery with ajax calls are made with setInterval ?
[10:39:45] <RohanBhangui> is it possible to find the position of the li#show
[10:39:51] <RohanBhangui> for the rohan
[10:39:53] <RohanBhangui> thing
[10:40:02] <RohanBhangui> and then use that as my left property
[10:40:20] <shoky> angrywombat_ use callbacks. for example: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/fwMSF/
[10:41:19] <shoky> RohanBhangui its possible to find the position of any element and use that anywhere you want to
[10:41:25] <angrywombat_> that's what i am asking i guess.. there's no real way to force async after 1.8, right?
[10:41:44] <shoky> angrywombat_ you mean force sync
[10:41:44] <Eviltwin> There's no reason you ever should have used synchronous AJAX
[10:41:52] <Eviltwin> Learn to use callbacks
[10:41:55] <Eviltwin> They are superior in every way
[10:43:00] <raj> shoky, can I put the start=null, start1=null variables into one of these functions?
[10:43:03] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/LbjHV/7/
[10:43:12] <angrywombat_> shoky: yep
[10:43:20] <raj> perhaps in the document button click callback
[10:43:35] <raj> or attached to window.start1 or something
[10:43:47] <Eviltwin> Why?
[10:43:50] <shoky> raj now they're in a function: http://jsfiddle.net/LbjHV/8/
[10:43:54] <angrywombat_> i figured that with regards to callbacks, i was just wondering
[10:44:19] <raj> nono, that's cheating, I already have that on my page
[10:44:27] <shoky> how is it cheating :)
[10:44:33] <raj> I wanna modularize this whole timer thing
[10:44:34] <shoky> its the recommended way to go
[10:44:37] <diverdude> I am trying to understand why the popup-image moves when the mouse moves over the background image. Is it possible to just fix the popup-image until mouse is moved out of the image? Here: http://jsfiddle.net/Y7pd5/14/
[10:44:38] <shoky> exactly
[10:44:41] <raj> the only portion I want exposed is the click function
[10:44:47] <Eviltwin> Modularize means NOT THROWING SHIT IN GLOBAL SCOPE
[10:44:52] <raj> I wanna call the click function, and then everything happens
[10:44:57] <shoky> raj start and start1 are not exposed anywhere
[10:45:07] <raj> so I don't mind the two functions (stepBinder and step) cuz they're in functions
[10:45:23] <raj> shoky, I meant so I can put them in a neat little package, organization-wise
[10:45:42] <rohanrhu> hi
[10:45:44] <rohanrhu> i need help
[10:45:45] <shoky> raj a function is such a neat little package
[10:45:57] <raj> yeah, but not ina document ready function
[10:46:25] <shoky> what do you mean
[10:46:26] <rohanrhu> how can i define local variable in .click(function () { ... })?
[10:46:28] <raj> I already have one of those on the page, and I didn't wanna put those variables so far away from the rest of these relevant functions (stebinder/step/clickhandler)
[10:47:04] <raj> preferrably, I want everything within the clickhandler
[10:47:07] <raj> so it's all kept together
[10:47:16] <rohanrhu> each click handler function's variable should be local
[10:47:18] <diverdude> any1?
[10:47:34] <rohanrhu> how can i do it?
[10:48:10] <NoiseEee> rohanrhu:  .click(function () { var p = 'hi'; //local })
[10:48:28] <rohanrhu> .click(func) -> each func's "this" variable should be local
[10:48:35] <shoky> raj i dont rly get what you mean
[10:48:42] <rohanrhu> NoiseEee: no it dont works
[10:49:04] <NoiseEee> rohanrhu i dont rly get what you mean
[10:49:14] <rohanrhu> because $('.same_class').click(...
[10:49:26] <rohanrhu> .same_class
[10:49:40] <Eviltwin> rohanrhu: I think you might want to see ?.proxy
[10:49:41] <bot-t> rohanrhu, jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[10:49:42] <raj> if possible, I'd like for all the logic of this timer to sit within the 'click' handler
[10:49:43] <Eviltwin> Perhaps
[10:49:48] <rohanrhu> all handlers is signle function
[10:49:52] <rohanrhu> signle*
[10:50:08] <rohanrhu> Eviltwin: im looking thank you
[10:50:15] <Eviltwin> raj: Why?
[10:50:27] <raj> Eviltwin, to keep it clean and contained
[10:50:53] <Eviltwin> I don't consider putting a bunch of global timer logic into an anonymous event handler function to be clean
[10:51:37] <Eviltwin> But then again I can't really tell what you're trying to do with these timers
[10:52:17] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/LbjHV/9/
[10:52:34] <Eviltwin> I can't really tell what you're trying to do with these timers
[10:52:53] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/LbjHV/10/
[10:52:57] <diverdude> How can i check if the mouse is over an element?
[10:53:24] <RohanBhangui> shoky
[10:53:31] <Eviltwin> raj: What I'm seeing is identical to this: http://jsfiddle.net/YLN7X/
[10:53:36] <RohanBhangui> ehre is what is happening when i have items open and i resize browser
[10:53:38] <RohanBhangui> http://i.imgur.com/7F2rV.png
[10:53:54] <shoky> RohanBhangui: i know, that's what your code is doing, that's what i've been telling you for an hour
[10:54:04] <raj> Eviltwin, yeah, except without a timer that counts up
[10:54:08] <RohanBhangui> sry im not very good at listening
[10:54:14] <RohanBhangui> would you mind telling me again
[10:54:22] <Eviltwin> raj: I'm not seeing any timers
[10:54:35] <shoky> the 0 0
[10:54:38] <raj> Eviltwin, http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/LbjHV/10/
[10:54:41] <RohanBhangui> what
[10:54:43] <raj> click `start`
[10:54:44] <diverdude> any1=?
[10:54:56] <Eviltwin> raj: I'm seeing 0 0 no matter what I clic
[10:54:57] <Eviltwin> k
[10:55:07] <raj> what browser?
[10:55:20] <shoky> RohanBhangui: you are setting all of their 'left' to 0.4 of the window width
[10:55:27] <RohanBhangui> so what should  ido
[10:55:31] <shoky> RohanBhangui: which is what we see inyour screenshot
[10:55:32] <Eviltwin> Chrome
[10:55:36] <RohanBhangui> okay
[10:55:41] <Eviltwin> I think it's because your Date().now() instead of Date.now()
[10:56:00] <shoky> im on chrome too
[10:56:09] <raj> I don't have Date().now()
[10:56:15] <raj> oh, I do
[10:56:18] <Eviltwin> Yes, you do
[10:56:39] <shoky> huh
[10:56:39] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/LbjHV/11/
[10:56:43] <shoky> ohh
[10:56:44] <raj> so that works for you Eviltwin ?
[10:56:53] <Eviltwin> Yes
[10:56:57] <RohanBhangui> shoky?
[10:56:59] <raj> k, cool
[10:57:01] <shoky> RohanBhangui?
[10:57:02] <RohanBhangui> so wha tdo yu suggest i do
[10:57:03] <raj> wonder why it worked for me regardless
[10:57:09] <shoky> raj for me too
[10:57:18] <shoky> but got an error in console
[10:57:21] <Eviltwin> So you want to have two timers
[10:57:27] <shoky> ah no
[10:57:27] <Eviltwin> One that starts on the first click
[10:57:28] <shoky> nm
[10:57:39] <Eviltwin> And one that resets every time there's a click?
[10:57:50] <diverdude> How can i check if the mouse is over an element?
[10:57:52] <shoky> RohanBhangui: DONT set them to 0.4 of the window width :)
[10:57:59] <RohanBhangui> -.-
[10:58:00] <diverdude> from within an eventhandler
[10:58:04] <raj> anyway, I have a button that is dynamically generated. When that button is clicked, I want the timers to begin. If any other start button is clicked, timer1 should be the only one resetting, while timer2 stays independent
[10:58:04] <RohanBhangui> -.-'
[10:58:09] <Eviltwin> diverdude: I don't believe there's a good way. I think you have to listen to mouseover and mouseout and use a flag
[10:58:18] <RohanBhangui> i have set left property in px
[10:58:18] <raj> yes, exactly as you said Eviltwin
[10:58:20] <RohanBhangui> doesnt work
[10:58:25] <RohanBhangui> when i scale
[10:58:31] <shoky> yes in px, to 0.4 of window width!!!
[10:58:33] <shoky> wtf
[10:58:41] <Eviltwin> raj: So what should be notified of these timers?
[10:58:45] <Eviltwin> raj: What's the generic usecase?
[10:58:54] <diverdude> Eviltwin: my problem is here:http://jsfiddle.net/Y7pd5/15/
[10:59:00] <raj> for the user to see how much time they've elapsed in a game
[10:59:12] <diverdude> Eviltwin: if you move the mouse over the image and into the popup image you will see the images moves
[10:59:28] <Eviltwin> raj: So you're just interested in this specific usecase, not a general one?
[10:59:34] <diverdude> Eviltwin: that is because the mouse moves out of the first images and thereby removes the popup
[10:59:37] <raj> what might a general one be?
[10:59:51] <Eviltwin> Well you seemed intent on doing some sort of encapsulation
[10:59:59] <Eviltwin> Typically encapsulation is done for reuseable code
[11:00:09] <diverdude> Eviltwin: so i need to do like if(!mouseIsOverPopUpImage) removePopup()
[11:00:13] <RohanBhangui> shoky
[11:00:17] <RohanBhangui> there has to be a way
[11:00:20] <diverdude> Eviltwin: you understand?
[11:00:26] <shoky> RohanBhangui there is
[11:00:36] <RohanBhangui> then......
[11:00:40] <RohanBhangui> im trying everyhting
[11:00:43] <RohanBhangui> percentage converion
[11:00:45] <RohanBhangui> p
[11:00:47] <RohanBhangui> px
[11:01:01] <shoky> all you have to do is exactly what you want to happen.
[11:01:21] <shoky> for example. if you dont want all of them to go to the same 'left' position (0.4 of window width), then DONT DO THAT
[11:01:47] <diverdude> Eviltwin: ?
[11:03:08] <raj> I have a function that binds $something.find('.start').on('click', beginTimer). And there are a bunch of $something's that get added to the dom ($something looks sorta like $("<div><span></span><p></p><button class='start'></button></div>"))
[11:03:33] <RohanBhangui> when i save the postion of #show using .postion and console.log the the left position it says 50
[11:03:37] <raj> and so i don't mind beginTimer and step and stepBinder being outside of that parent function
[11:03:53] <diverdude> can anybody help me with this issue? http://jsfiddle.net/Y7pd5/15/
[11:03:58] <raj> but I do mind if var start/start1 are defined outside of any of these 3,4 functions
[11:04:02] <RohanBhangui> oh shit
[11:04:06] <RohanBhangui> i finally ge tit
[11:04:10] <RohanBhangui> *get it
[11:04:11] <shoky> RohanBhangui here is an example of how NOT to move them:  http://jsfiddle.net/dqNqD/14/
[11:04:54] <RohanBhangui> shoky
[11:05:07] <RohanBhangui> if if postion them using incriments then it wont work
[11:05:11] <RohanBhangui> see what im thinking
[11:05:14] <RohanBhangui> thinking
[11:05:19] <shoky> no idea what youre thinking
[11:05:22] <shoky> or saying ;]
[11:05:22] <RohanBhangui> is set facebook to pos say 50%
[11:05:29] <RohanBhangui> then then enxt one at 45%
[11:05:31] <RohanBhangui> and so on
[11:05:32] <shoky> no facebook, please
[11:05:35] <shoky> stop right there :\
[11:05:41] <RohanBhangui> bu the problem with that is then i cant use my angle stuff
[11:06:01] <RohanBhangui> you see my code
[11:06:07] <RohanBhangui> my links
[11:06:10] <RohanBhangui> or li
[11:06:16] <shoky> dude
[11:06:24] <RohanBhangui> elemnts im thinking of setting based on percentages and writing those to the screen
[11:06:31] <shoky> you are talking all confused. its not helping. take a break or something :\
[11:06:44] <RohanBhangui> dude ive been at this for the apst 3 weeks
[11:06:49] <RohanBhangui> im not stopping
[11:06:55] <raj> how about my stuff shoky, did it make sense??
[11:06:56] <raj> :)
[11:06:57] <rohanrhu> Eviltwin: i dont understand
[11:07:05] <shoky> it seems you are just guessing stuff, RohanBhangui
[11:07:12] <shoky> start thinking more, talking less
[11:07:16] <RohanBhangui> no im trying to do stuff
[11:07:17] <RohanBhangui> logically
[11:07:20] <shoky> dont do stuff
[11:07:22] <shoky> think about them
[11:07:30] <RohanBhangui> but it doesnt seem to come incode well
[11:07:34] <robdodson> Is it possible to use jQuery.proxy for all of the methods of an object without having to list each one. Similar to Underscore's bindAll?

[11:09:44] <shoky> raj i didnt fully get you, no ;P
[11:10:54] <Eviltwin> raj: Here's one approach: http://jsfiddle.net/LbjHV/12/
[11:11:01] <rohanrhu> Eviltwin: please help me
[11:11:01] <Eviltwin> You use a self-executing function
[11:11:09] <Eviltwin> rohanrhu: Please be patient
[11:11:31] <shoky> good ol' module pattern
[11:11:35] <Eviltwin> raj: You use a self-executing function and return the public methods (or other public stuff) you want to expose
[11:11:43] <Eviltwin> The rest is locked safely inside
[11:12:02] <min|dvir|us> I want to cause an alert() after every #button click specifically by replacing HTML. http://jsfiddle.net/eNtVV/ -- any thoughts why this doesn't work?
[11:12:17] <Eviltwin> min|dvir|us: Please, for the love of God, forget alert() ever existed
[11:12:25] <rohanrhu> Eviltwin: ok
[11:12:28] <rohanrhu> thank you
[11:12:39] <Eviltwin> rohanrhu: pastebin is not loading for me. Can you make a jsFiddle instead?
[11:12:41] <min|dvir|us> Eviltwin: do you honestly think I'm going to use alert() on a production site?
[11:12:58] <raj> Eviltwin, that's much much better, thank you. Is there any way to shove var requestAnimationFrame in there too?
[11:12:59] <min|dvir|us> Eviltwin: do you honestly think that the JSfiddle is anything but a test case?
[11:13:03] <min|dvir|us> God, so much arrogance.
[11:13:06] <NoiseEee> min|dvir|us: why don't use a sample that actually reflects what you're trying to do
[11:13:11] <Eviltwin> min|dvir|us: Why do you have an inline <script> anyway?
[11:13:19] <rohanrhu> Eviltwin: http://88.238.143.79/animesitesi
[11:13:21] <min|dvir|us> NoiseEee: that sample is exactly what I want.
[11:13:27] <Eviltwin> raj: I would hesitate to since you're overwriting a global
[11:13:30] <min|dvir|us> Eviltwin: it's not mine.
[11:13:39] <min|dvir|us> Eviltwin: that is, it will be placed there by a third party.
[11:13:41] <min|dvir|us> My job is to reload it.
[11:13:45] <Eviltwin> raj: That could be bundled in its own self-executing function but it's important to realize that it's different than the others
[11:13:55] <raj> how so?
[11:14:06] <rohanrhu> http://88.238.143.79/animesitesi/animesitesi/index.php/js?dosya=js/js.js
[11:14:06] <raj> what global is being overwritten by it?
[11:14:23] <min|dvir|us> NoiseEee: so, feel free to help whenever you're ready, now that you know my true objective (exactly what I said).
[11:14:38] <Eviltwin> raj: Oh, sorry, I misread
[11:14:38] <NoiseEee> min|dvir|us: no thanks

[11:15:34] <shoky> min|dvir|us:  using 'this' is wrong there..
[11:15:36] <raj> trying it out, un momento
[11:15:47] <min|dvir|us> shoky: why do you say that?
[11:15:47] <Eviltwin> rohanrhu: We'd prefer it if you could isolate your issue in a jsFiddle
[11:15:57] <Eviltwin> Rather than linking us to a site with tons of other things going on
[11:16:04] <Eviltwin> It will help us help you more effectively
[11:16:30] <shoky> min|dvir|us: what do you expect 'this' to be there?
[11:16:38] <rohanrhu> Eviltwin: many codes exists can you look direct?
[11:16:39] <min|dvir|us> shoky: #container.
[11:16:58] <Eviltwin> rohanrhu: It's your job to figure out what piece of the code is the problem
[11:17:02] <shoky> min|dvir|us oh ok. nvm
[11:17:10] <Eviltwin> rohanrhu: And then if you can't figure out why it's a problem, turn to us with that piece
[11:19:38] <rohanrhu> Eviltwin: problem is
[11:19:49] <shoky> min|dvir|us:  clone(true)
[11:20:16] <shoky> ah that only works once
[11:20:38] <min|dvir|us> shoky: it only works once without true, as well.
[11:21:00] <rohanrhu> Eviltwin: click handler function is for .same_class and click handler function's all variables does not be local
[11:21:05] <shoky> anyway DOM manipulation should be seperate from script shit
[11:21:16] <min|dvir|us> shoky: it is.
[11:21:26] <min|dvir|us> Not that that matters.
[11:21:28] <shoky> its really browser dependent how that would behave
[11:21:38] <min|dvir|us> shoky: ain't that the truth.
[11:21:47] <min|dvir|us> My task is to cause a script to execute again.
[11:21:51] <Eviltwin> rohanrhu: I'm behind a bunch of firewalls. jsFiddle works but your site won't load for me
[11:21:52] <min|dvir|us> This is what I've come up with.
[11:22:00] <Eviltwin> rohanrhu: It's really help me if you can make a jsFiddle isolating the problem

[11:25:19] <SoulRaven> please help me with something,
[11:25:36] <SoulRaven> i have a ui dialog, and inside this dialog, i have some ui tabs
[11:25:48] <SoulRaven> the problem is that i have a vertical scroll bar
[11:26:06] <devOlsen_> Hey, trying to write a condition selector using :contains.. Basicly I want to have a true false returned value conditioned on if the element (this) has an attribute of rel that contains ? in the string.. any suggestions?
[11:26:10] <SoulRaven> and i can't remote that scrollbar
[11:26:27] <SoulRaven> anyone enconter this type of problem?
[11:26:52] <aftab> Hello, can I ask question regarding jquery lightbox please ?
[11:27:17] <shoky> devOlsen_:   $(this).attr('rel').indexOf('?') >= 0
[11:27:20] <poppiez> I'm having some keyboard inconsistency. I was using keypress to track, well, key presses, but that doesn't work in chrome for arrow keys. so I switched to keydown, but keydown doesn't work in opera?!
[11:27:38] <min|dvir|us> shoky: haha.
[11:27:44] <min|dvir|us> That's gross.
[11:27:57] <shoky> min|dvir|us: just as gross as yours ;)
[11:28:09] <shoky> if you want to run a script, you have to evaluate it.
[11:28:11] <sa2304> SoulRaven: overflow: hidden;
[11:29:29] <min|dvir|us> shoky: well it works the first time.
[11:29:30] <SoulRaven> sa2304: i know, but i don't want to modify the standard jquery css, this problem appera only when inside the tabs i have a table
[11:29:44] <shoky> min|dvir|us: mine?
[11:29:50] <SoulRaven> but the table don't have any height set
[11:29:54] <min|dvir|us> shoky: no, mine.
[11:29:58] <shoky> right..
[11:29:59] <SoulRaven> and no padding or something else
[11:30:17] <Whirl3d_> pfew, when it's time to sleep, it's time to sleep. Good afternoon #jquery

[11:30:30] <shoky> 'fternoon
[11:30:44] <Whirl3d_> Shoky!.
[11:30:49] <min|dvir|us> shoky: maybe there's a way without eval()?
[11:30:58] <sa2304> ?dialog
[11:30:59] <bot-t> sa2304, UI/API/1.8/Dialog - Overview Options Events Methods Theming jQuery UI Dialog Overview A dialog is a floating window that contains a title bar and a content area. The dialog window can be moved, resized and closed with... http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Dialog
[11:31:12] <shoky> min|dvir|us you can use new Function(...)  :\
[11:31:21] <shoky> min|dvir|us but thats the same as eval'ing it
[11:31:31] <shoky> maybe  a tiny bit less evil ;P
[11:31:58] <shoky> sups whirly
[11:32:08] <raj> Eviltwin, instead of a self-executing timer function, can I just call timer() on document.ready()?
[11:32:17] <sa2304> SoulRaven: You can use dialog's height option
[11:32:18] <Whirl3d_> I got a couple of questions  about deffered and how they react when resolvedWith or resolve(data)....Once a Deferred is resolved (or rejected) and you assign a done handler to it, it fires immediately...but if it's resolvedWith does it fire in the context with which it was resolved
[11:32:22] <whitenoise> hey jquery dudes, I have a <select> that I am trying to store the original value of that is within a modal. Any methods of doing so? If I catch the val() on the 'change' event, it's already the new value. And it's in a modal, so everything has to be live rather than just on document ready.
[11:32:26] <sa2304> ?tabs
[11:32:27] <bot-t> sa2304, UI/API/1.8/Tabs - Tabs are generally used to break content into multiple sections that can be swapped to save space, much like an accordion. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tabs
[11:32:51] <Whirl3d_> and what about resolved(data) does the (data) get passed to handlers assigned after the thing is resolved?
[11:32:55] <Eviltwin> raj: Not quite sure what you mean but what I showed is the best pattern I've seen
[11:33:06] <SoulRaven> sa2304: height is set to AUTO
[11:33:31] <shoky> Whirl3d_ it fires with the context you provided
[11:33:35] <raj> k
[11:33:57] <shoky> Whirl3d_ didn't understand your 2nd q
[11:34:15] <sa2304> SoulRaven: so, who makes you use AUTO? Define your own height
[11:34:33] <sa2304> override it when you call dialog
[11:34:38] <SoulRaven> i can't because the content is dinamic
[11:34:49] <SoulRaven> so AUTO is the best option for me
[11:34:54] <sa2304> so use 'create' events
[11:35:03] <sa2304> on dialog or tabs
[11:35:07] <sa2304> on*
[11:35:16] <Whirl3d_> like deferred.resolve({status:"ok"}) sends the {status:"ok"} object as a parameter to the handler, but what about handlers defined after the thing is resolved?
[11:35:55] <danheberden> handlers attached after get that same param
[11:35:55] <shoky> Whirl3d_ they'll also get it as a parameter
[11:35:57] <raj> Eviltwin, how can I pass `event` in?
[11:36:01] <sa2304> calculate & adjust height inside 'create' event handler
[11:36:04] <danheberden> it's how #
[11:36:06] <danheberden> oops
[11:36:22] <danheberden> it's how $.Callbacks operates - keeping arguments for later resolution
[11:36:25] <Eviltwin> raj: Why should your timers be aware of DOM events?
[11:36:32] <raj> var timer = (function(ev) {function beginTimer() {$(ev.target).hide()}} didn't work
[11:36:56] <raj> cuz when the button is clicked, i wanna hide the button
[11:37:11] <Eviltwin> Link me the jsFiddle again
[11:37:14] <raj> perhaps you're right, i should just abstract this
[11:37:17] <Eviltwin> YEs
[11:37:18] <Eviltwin> Yes*
[11:37:20] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/LbjHV/13/
[11:37:26] <Eviltwin> The timers should be separate from what they're being used for
[11:37:31] <raj> make a jquery plugin I suppose
[11:37:51] <raj> although (just like most of this script) I have no idea how to do that
[11:38:24] <Whirl3d_> and you know how you can use the defferred.pipe method to chain deferreds? would it be bad form to write a plugin (like, "spout") that you could put at the end of some piped deferred that would bascially cause the same resolve or reject to be applied to a deferred....
[11:38:47] <raj> I found this, but it probably won't be as accurate since there's no requestAnimationFrame --> http://walmik.info/demos/timer.jquery/timer.jquery.js
[11:38:55] <danheberden> Whirl3d_: http://danheberden.com/presentations/jqsummit-deferreds-in-jquery/#29
[11:38:58] <danheberden> is that what you're talking about?
[11:39:02] <raj> was hoping to do that with what I currently have in this fiddle
[11:39:03] <Whirl3d_> myDefer.pip(someFunc).pipe(someOtherFunc).spout(myOtherDefer);
[11:40:20] <shoky> danheberden hmm i dont think i understand that slide
[11:40:32] <shoky> or what's special about it
[11:40:34] <mzarella> is there a jquery method for selected text?
[11:40:50] <shoky> i guess i should run it tho huh
[11:41:00] <danheberden> shoky it should only work in chrome i'm sure
[11:41:08] <shoky> yea it worked :P
[11:41:27] <danheberden> it was for the whole adding a done fn after the dfd resolved thing
[11:41:32] <min|dvir|us> Marwin: you were saying?
[11:41:53] <shoky> danheberden it worked in ff too
[11:42:14] <shoky> what's wrong about adding a done after resolve?
[11:42:32] <Eviltwin> shoky: Nothing, that's just what Whirl3d's .spout seems to do
[11:42:38] <shoky> ohh
[11:42:47] <Eviltwin> Based on his description
[11:43:15] <SoulRaven> sa2304: strange is when i change the font size in body form .7em to .8em, the vertical scrollbar disapear
[11:46:34] <Whirl3d_> sorry, I had to read all those slides and danheberden, you are a laugh riot. great slides though.
[11:47:12] <shoky> what i understood from Whirl3d_ is that he wants smth like  dfd.then( myOtherDfd.resolve, myOtherDfd.reject )
[11:47:33] <shoky> dont see how its related to pipe tho
[11:48:01] <Whirl3d_> It probably doesn't..it was just the context that I found a need for it..
[11:48:11] <Whirl3d_> but I could probably use .when
[11:48:14] <shoky> you spouter you
[11:48:45] <aftab> How do I skip broken/blank image links in jQuery lightbox please ?
[11:49:10] <rohanrhu> Eviltwin:
[11:49:10] <monk13> quick question. about IE that has a F12/Developer Tools like 8... if the Dev Tools is not showing, and console.log() is called. Does it error since the console is not 'available' at that moment.
[11:49:21] <Whirl3d_> except that it's tricky to use .when inside a function...I would still want a when spout...Where I could do   .when(a,b,c).spout(myBigDeferred);
[11:49:25] <monk13> coulda swore one of the older IE's that has a console, had that issue.
[11:49:43] <nlistana> does anyone here know how to test a method from class.create in your html?
[11:49:48] <shoky> Whirl3d_ so why not .then( myOtherDfd.resolve, myOtherDfd.reject )
[11:50:28] <gnarf> if you aren't altering the resolve/reject
[11:50:30] <gnarf> why have two?
[11:50:34] <Whirl3d_> sure, make it easy... i mean if you want to do it the easy way and get something done...lol
[11:50:36] <whitenoise> isn't there a jquery event that fires whenever a modal opens?
[11:50:38] <shoky> that too
[11:50:40] <gnarf> ?ajaxQueue
[11:50:41] <bot-t> jQuery.ajaxQueue - A quick demonstration of a queue for ajax calls using jQuery.Deferred() jQuery.ajax() and .queue() - http://gnarf.net/2011/06/21/jquery-ajaxqueue/
[11:50:49] <whitenoise> onOpen or something
[11:51:12] <gnarf> ^^^ that uses .done( dfd.resolve ).fail( dfd.reject )
[11:51:32] <gnarf> but its because its a "double async" operation
[11:51:43] <RohanBhangui> im aobut to go crazy
[11:51:47] <RohanBhangui> i cant figur ethis out
[11:51:49] <gnarf> the jqXHR doesn't exist until after the first dfd already existed
[11:51:49] <Whirl3d_> gnarf, I have been trying to get away from constant state-checking for my animation elements.
[11:51:52] <RohanBhangui> i even went back a few step
[11:51:54] <RohanBhangui> s
[11:51:56] <RohanBhangui> ugh
[11:52:00] <MeanderingCode> hello all
[11:52:19] <Whirl3d_> so, by having a deferred that gets returned, if the animation is complete, the deferred is automatically resolved, no gap
[11:52:45] <MeanderingCode> can anyone tell me why my pages won't scroll on mobile browsers after i cut content out, then place new content in its place?
[11:52:51] <species> so I have a canvas, in a game, but I need to stop the context menu appearing when the user right clicks (so allow rmb to be used in the game)
[11:52:59] <species> ive used ev.stopPropagation() but it doesnt actually prevent the right click being noticed
[11:53:16] <species> the canvas is the deepest element in the tree and the event is attached to that
[11:53:20] <NoiseEee> species: return false on the event 'oncontextmenu'
[11:53:27] <species> ahh
[11:53:41] <species> i was doing it on mouseup/down
[11:53:43] <species> TY
[11:54:14] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: 1.7 or 1.8pre ?
[11:54:18] <species> so what, $(canvRef).contextmenu(...) then?
[11:54:20] <Whirl3d_> so rather than asking if (elem.css('opacity")<.09) {elem.fadeOut().done(this);}  I just say elem.dfadeOut().pipe(dothis);
[11:54:23] <Whirl3d_> 1.7
[11:54:45] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: elem.fadeOut().promise().done( this )
[11:54:56] <mzarella> is there a jquery method for determining which text is highlighted?
[11:55:23] <species> NoiseEee: not working:   		$(this.CanvRef).contextmenu(function(ev){ev.stopPropagation();});
[11:55:28] <Whirl3d_> I have had cases where I call animate and it reruns an animation (or just the delay, if I remember correctly) when I call  it
[11:55:46] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: $.fn.promise() returns a promise that gets resolved when the queue is complete
[11:55:57] <gnarf> so once an element stops animating, you get a resolve
[11:55:58] <Whirl3d_> if elem is fadedOut and I run elem.fadeOut() it should not reque the fadeOut event
[11:56:33] <Whirl3d_> or if I queue up an animation to fade out in the middle of a fade out, it runs again
[11:56:38] * species didnt read what he was told
[11:56:47] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: yeah
[11:56:53] <gnarf> animation in jQuery is queue based
[11:56:55] <Whirl3d_> I was trying to get it to know that it was fading out and not re-fade out
[11:57:31] <NoiseEee> species: got it?
[11:57:37] <Whirl3d_> or if it was headed towards being fade out...just add the callback from the new fadeout to the old one
[11:57:45] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: i see
[11:57:50] <species> aye, thanks a lot
[11:58:04] <Whirl3d_> in 1.8, it looks like you may have that ready to go...
[11:58:16] <Whirl3d_> because you have the endVal proeprty (or equiv)
[11:58:40] <Whirl3d_> so I can look at that to determine if I should just pile my callback on it's queu or stop it and make it go the other way
[11:58:42] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: lemme draft something quick
[11:59:58] <Whirl3d_> and I never use fadeout, btw. I just figured it demonstrated the point. I don't know why I am skiddish about the shortcut methods, but I am.
[12:00:48] <Whirl3d_> danheberden, thanks again for the link. those slides explain a lot...still going through them again.
[12:03:11] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: https://gist.github.com/c49c697bdbba7876e7a7
[12:03:14] <danheberden> Whirl3d_: there's a vid of the presentation too somewhere
[12:03:15] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: something like that?
[12:03:27] <Whirl3d_> gnarf, the problem I keep coming up with is that the easing formulas don't work if there are more than one point of resolution.
[12:04:02] <gnarf> danheberden: yayquery vimeo
[12:04:25] <quiznilo> anyone know of any good tutorials for jQuery?  I don't much care for the 'official' ones
[12:04:30] <gnarf> ?learn
[12:04:31] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[12:04:43] <quiznilo> hey thanks gnarf
[12:05:35] <Whirl3d_> so gnarf, you are saying that you store the "safefadeout" $.Callbacks() object in the data object of the animating element. then check that data property and add to it if it exists...
[12:05:52] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: just a thought
[12:06:06] <gnarf> although i just noticed i forgot to add "callback" to the callbacks object on first create
[12:07:29] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: updated https://gist.github.com/c49c697bdbba7876e7a7
[12:07:52] <Whirl3d_> See, I am tyring to also resolve the issue where if I need to fade from 0 to 1 over 5 seconds....and my elem is at .5 ....it shouldn't take 5 seconds
[12:08:12] <Whirl3d_> but trying to decipher (with easing) how long it should take is not easy
[12:08:27] <Whirl3d_> especially with bounce, or back, or some custom easing methods
[12:08:33] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: so - why would it ever be not 1 ?
[12:08:40] <gnarf> are you stopping another animation early
[12:08:42] <gnarf> ?
[12:08:47] <Whirl3d_> sure
[12:09:05] <Whirl3d_> or maybe it starts at one for some and for others it .5 right out the box
[12:09:23] <Whirl3d_> the idea being that a fade from 0 to 1 has a behavior that takes 5 secons
[12:09:41] <Whirl3d_> so how long does it take for something at .1
[12:10:05] <Whirl3d_> This becomes compounded by queueing
[12:11:06] <Whirl3d_> if it's gonna take me 5 seconds to go from .1 to 0   _or_ from 1 to 0, I stand the risk of queuing up some other animations if I don't manage those animations carefully
[12:11:57] <Whirl3d_> whereas, if I could get the progress of the animation at any time and add tweenable properties that took my current state into consideration relative to the animation behavior, that would be great
[12:12:01] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: kinda lost in your use cases --- If you were wanting to fade something out, base its duration on the current value
[12:12:57] <mzarella> what is wrong with this? https://gist.github.com/7194d802b14d174c582f
[12:13:03] <Whirl3d_> so how do I do the math to determine the adjusted amount of time I need to make 5 balls of different opacities all fade out to 0 at the same time
[12:13:19] <Whirl3d_> linearly, no problem
[12:13:31] <Whirl3d_> add easing and it's trickier.
[12:13:35] <gnarf> well - "at the same time" to me means they all take 5 seconds
[12:13:45] <danheberden> haha
[12:13:50] <gnarf> "at the same speend" is something entirely different
[12:13:55] <gnarf> speed*
[12:14:00] <Whirl3d_> that's over the same time. I mean at 1:15:05.3 secds
[12:14:08] <Whirl3d_> that's the same time
[12:14:14] <Whirl3d_> yours was the same speed
[12:14:28] <danheberden> Whirl3d_: just ease them with whatever easing for how long you want?
[12:14:36] <Whirl3d_> how long is that
[12:14:40] <Whirl3d_> that's the question
[12:14:44] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: so you want to delay the start of their animation?
[12:15:02] <Whirl3d_> no.
[12:15:11] <Whirl3d_> I will setup a fiddle to show you...brb
[12:15:25] <gnarf> so you have 5 (for the sake of very easy argument) divs - having opacities [1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2]
[12:16:08] <RohanBhangui> shoky how come when i run code in js fiddle it runs fin and scales well but not in a regualr browser window
[12:16:16] <gnarf> current timestamp is "0"
[12:16:17] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/tKBtr/17/
[12:16:23] <gnarf> what would you like to happen by "5000" ?
[12:16:46] <RohanBhangui> anyone help why the finshing animation goes to far right?
[12:16:48] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/tKBtr/17/
[12:24:22] <jehe> This code works great on jsfiddle, but it doesnt work in my chrome or firefox:http://jsfiddle.net/J8yjG/ whats up with that?
[12:24:23] <gnarf> RohanBhangui: I'm not really understanding whats supposed to be happening here
[12:24:32] <RohanBhangui> oh
[12:24:33] <RohanBhangui> okay
[12:24:34] <thornofmight> is there a way to send post data but have it act like a form
[12:24:35] <gnarf> RohanBhangui: they all seem to animate from the same position
[12:24:37] <thornofmight> ie it redirects you there
[12:24:48] <thornofmight> not even redirects, it directs you there immediately
[12:24:57] <gnarf> RohanBhangui: why not have your "reset position" just be a constant?
[12:25:02] <thornofmight> like $.ajax({type: 'submit, post'
[12:25:09] <gnarf> rather than trying to invert your trig
[12:25:13] <RohanBhangui> see im trying to solve two problems
[12:25:15] <RohanBhangui> hod on
[12:25:17] <RohanBhangui> let me get something
[12:27:27] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/tKBtr/19/
[12:27:38] <RohanBhangui> when i change browser width it coems out funny
[12:28:02] <RohanBhangui> gnarf you there?
[12:28:11] <jehe> Why can't google chrome run this jquery script? But alert('hello') works great outside jquery code? http://jsfiddle.net/J8yjG/
[12:29:20] <sacho> it works just fine
[12:29:22] <gnarf> RohanBhangui: you can use a position: relative container with a static width
[12:29:29] <jehe> sacho it does?
[12:29:37] <gnarf> RohanBhangui: and then base your positions off of that box
[12:29:43] <jehe> cause my chrome nor firefox can run it
[12:29:44] <devOlsen_> Hey is there a way to make the array's indexer not equal the variable's name but the variable's value? http://jsfiddle.net/33geK/
[12:29:48] <gnarf> rather than "screen dimensions"
[12:29:51] <RohanBhangui> can you show me?
[12:29:54] <jehe> jquery code
[12:30:44] <sacho> devOlsen_, what does that fiddle have to do with your question?
[12:30:49] <gnarf> RohanBhangui: honestly, there is too much going on in that example for me to dig into it with any amount of speed
[12:30:57] <devOlsen_> if you see the console log of your inpsector
[12:30:57] <gnarf> and i have a lot of work to be doin
[12:30:59] <devOlsen_> you will see the array
[12:31:00] <gnarf> ask danheberden
[12:31:02] <devOlsen_> see the indexer
[12:31:08] <gnarf> he's gonna crack a whip on me
[12:31:09] <devOlsen_> I want it to not say indexer but like width, or height
[12:31:36] <gnarf> RohanBhangui: do you know about position: relative and position: absolute?
[12:31:43] <RohanBhangui> yes
[12:32:06] <gnarf> so - make a div container that is your "700px" wide or whatever, and have it "centered"
[12:32:16] <gnarf> then make all your li's absolute relative to it
[12:32:30] <gnarf> and then your positions will be the same regardless of browser width
[12:32:58] <gnarf> that - or switch to using percentages is another option
[12:33:10] <gnarf> that makes it a little more "Flexable"
[12:33:27] <sacho> devOlsen_, don't use an object literal. var obj = {}; obj[indexer] = valuer; jquery.push(obj);
[12:33:36] <sacho> or well, don't use *just* an object literal
[12:33:56] <Whirl3d_> almost there...http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/BtghD/8/
[12:33:59] <Whirl3d_> lol
[12:35:12] <devOlsen_> thanks a ton sacho.
[12:36:02] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/BtghD/10/
[12:36:10] <Whirl3d_> click on any ball and then click it again.
[12:36:38] <Whirl3d_> you can see that the stopped ball no longer appears to be affected by gravity...or not nearly as much
[12:37:11] <gnarf> so like for that you need to lower your duration by a factor of its height
[12:37:22] <gnarf> to me thats "same speed"
[12:37:32] <gnarf> meaning to travel 100 px you want 1 second
[12:38:11] <Whirl3d_> that only works for linear "speeds"
[12:38:40] <RohanBhangui> gnarf: what do you mean by "then make all your li's absolute relative to it"
[12:40:25] <species> no offense guys, i know this is jquery, but thats not the way to implement physics
[12:40:37] <species> its actually slower than calculating it in real time using newton
[12:40:40] <srj55> how would I select an element that does not have "a child with an <input id='enabled'>"    e.g.   ('.onoff_box').not('> #enabled')  ??
[12:40:51] <RohanBhangui> >	gnarf: what do you mean by "then make all your li's absolute relative to it"
[12:41:55] <gnarf> RohanBhangui: a position: absolute element is relative to its nearest position: relative parent
[12:42:20] <MSan> who are there ?
[12:42:24] <gnarf> so if the UL is position: relative, a specific width, and "centered" your li's will be relative to it
[12:42:49] <MSan> show users
[12:42:57] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: so - while you are correct there, there are other issues with non-linear easings, like the "height" of the bounce
[12:43:23] <gnarf> but like
[12:43:30] <gnarf> it doesn't look terrible just assuming a linear http://jsfiddle.net/BtghD/15/
[12:43:36] <gnarf> also
[12:43:55] <gnarf> with easeOutBounce you could determine the point that it first gives "1"
[12:44:00] <gnarf> it should be the same always
[12:44:18] <gnarf> or that the directionality reverses
[12:44:28] <gnarf> and consider that your "linear amount"
[12:44:40] <gnarf> and then add an appropriate amount of "bouncing" time
[12:44:53] <gnarf> but its always going to bounce the same % of the time
[12:45:04] <gnarf> so a linear assumption is actually not terrible
[12:45:43] <gnarf> from what I can tell, what you are asking for is way more involved than easing and animation, its physics.
[12:46:49] <gnarf> if you're looking to model things more physics based, you'll need more than jQuery 1.7 can give you
[12:47:30] <RohanBhangui> gnarf thanks very much it works but i have a slight problem now everything is shifted to the right too much but  ithink i can fix that
[12:47:41] <RohanBhangui> oh shit
[12:47:49] <RohanBhangui> crap i knew it was too good to be true
[12:48:22] <RohanBhangui> now its sending the clsoing aniamtion way over to the right
[12:48:40] <gnarf> RohanBhangui: my suggestion from earlier get lost?
[12:48:59] <gnarf> why not make the "closing" animation just suck them all back to the "origin" rather than dealing with += / -= shit
[12:49:12] <gnarf> you could like hard code the "start" point for all of them
[12:49:16] <gnarf> since its the same
[12:49:30] <gnarf> and then your math wouldn't be suspect
[12:49:31] <gnarf> :)
[12:49:50] <RohanBhangui> can i grab the start point from a div tha is postioned based on %?
[12:50:10] <gnarf> RohanBhangui: yup... .position() assuming its in the same relative container
[12:50:10] <gnarf> :)
[12:50:27] <gnarf> ?position
[12:50:27] <bot-t> .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[12:50:49] <RohanBhangui> ugh does that bot swoop in everytime?

[12:51:38] <Kreczor-work> How do I turn off masked input on an object using this plugin: http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/			jQuery(function($) { $('#billing_phone').mask(""); }); doesn't seem to remove it and .off doesn't work.
[12:51:40] * gnarf frowns
[12:52:49] <gnarf> Kreczor-work: looks like .trigger("unmask")
[12:52:58] <gnarf> Kreczor-work: if i remember correctly
[12:53:03] <gnarf> I based a UI widget off of that
[12:53:17] <Kreczor-work> I'm using maskedinput.js
[12:53:33] <gnarf> yes - and i just looked at the source
[12:53:43] <gnarf> and it looks like it defines a $.fn.unmask
[12:53:53] <Kreczor-work> Ah, alright I'll give it a shot.
[12:53:55] <gnarf> that just calls .trigger( "unmask" )
[12:59:52] <Kreczor-work> gnarf: I tried a host of solutions ending with $('#billing_phone').trigger('unmask'); none of which are working.
[13:00:54] <gnarf> Kreczor-work: that should remove the mask
[13:01:01] <gnarf> it wont undo the data in the field
[13:01:08] <gnarf> but it should no longer be "masked"
[13:01:56] <Kreczor-work> The field in question is disabled, could that be preventing the unmask?
[13:02:11] <gnarf> Kreczor-work: maybe?
[13:02:18] <gnarf> Kreczor-work: unlikely from my read of the source
[13:02:30] <RohanBhangui> gnarf
[13:02:33] <RohanBhangui> when i get
[13:02:35] <gnarf> but if you expect it to strip the -'s or whatever mask literals you're using
[13:02:39] <gnarf> it wont
[13:02:47] <RohanBhangui> the .postion of an element that has the posotion set trough a %
[13:02:49] <gnarf> it just unbinds the events
[13:02:52] <RohanBhangui> how can i ge tthat in pixel
[13:02:58] <RohanBhangui> or should i manually calculate that
[13:03:07] <gnarf> RohanBhangui: it should be in pixels if you get it from .position()
[13:03:26] <RohanBhangui> the .position that im trying to read frm has the following css
[13:03:35] <RohanBhangui> #show {
[13:03:37] <RohanBhangui>   margin-left: 60%;
[13:03:39] <RohanBhangui> }
[13:03:47] <gnarf> RohanBhangui: margin?
[13:03:54] <gnarf> margin != position
[13:03:59] <RohanBhangui> yes
[13:04:03] <RohanBhangui> is that a bad idea
[13:04:08] <RohanBhangui> oh
[13:05:11] <Kreczor-work> I figured it out. Thanks a lot gnarf for the assistance!

[13:20:09] <RohanBhangui> why is it when i do the console line the left and top come out as 0
[13:21:09] <gnarf> RohanBhangui: so i make the container above it the one that is position: absolute
[13:21:13] <gnarf> er sorry
[13:21:14] <gnarf> relative
[13:21:34] <RohanBhangui> what?
[13:21:36] <peeer> If you visist this link and click the header "The first paragraph" does the jquery toggle slide work for you?

[13:22:01] <gnarf> something like that
[13:22:20] <gnarf> RohanBhangui: if you want the two positions to be "equal" they need to be in the same position: relative container
[13:22:48] <RohanBhangui> can i get rid of div class amin then?
[13:22:54] <RohanBhangui> #main i mean
[13:23:01] <gnarf> or use #main
[13:23:06] <gnarf> as your relative container
[13:23:09] <RohanBhangui> true
[13:24:04] <RohanBhangui> wehn i check the postion using console.log (of the targets they show as top: 0 and left: 0
[13:24:07] <RohanBhangui> any ideas?
[13:24:20] <kryl> macmartine, google ?
[13:24:23] <kryl> what's that
[13:24:56] <RohanBhangui> found out why they were hidden

[13:25:07] <gnarf> RohanBhangui: also
[13:25:13] <gnarf> RohanBhangui: just noticed you had $( targets )
[13:25:18] <gnarf> and targets is already a jQuery
[13:25:24] <gnarf> so you don't need to wrap it in jQuery again
[13:25:34] <gnarf> you can just targets.css( start_position )
[13:25:38] <RohanBhangui> i declared targets as a var
[13:25:47] <gnarf> RohanBhangui: yeah, targates = $( ... )
[13:25:58] <RohanBhangui> ya so idont have to wrap it?
[13:25:59] <gnarf> so $( $( "... " ) ) = pointless :)
[13:26:06] <RohanBhangui> lol
[13:26:19] <RohanBhangui> you make my thinking so stupid
[13:26:32] <gnarf> RohanBhangui: sok - I was at that level 1.5 yrs ago
[13:26:38] <gnarf> at least w/ jQuery ;)
[13:26:46] <RohanBhangui> lol
[13:26:50] <gnarf> clumbsy and curious tho - its the way to learn
[13:26:54] <RohanBhangui> true
[13:26:56] <RohanBhangui> see
[13:26:58] <RohanBhangui> my problem
[13:26:59] <RohanBhangui> is
[13:27:17] <barraponto> is there a plugin that triggers a callback when an element is at the top of the page?
[13:27:19] <RohanBhangui> i get logic cant write code for shit.....also i tend to use other peoples code and try to modify it to my needs
[13:27:23] <RohanBhangui> which ends up in a disaster
[13:28:16] <RohanBhangui> one thing why dont my i elements show up on screen
[13:28:28] <RohanBhangui> i have the .hide in comments
[13:29:52] <RohanBhangui> gnarf?
[13:30:16] <RohanBhangui> sry was trying to pm you
[13:30:36] <gnarf> try looking in the web inspector in chrome?
[13:30:42] <RohanBhangui> okay
[13:30:42] <gnarf> maybe css hides them first?
[13:30:55] <jyg> anyone here familiar with bootstrap-popover?
[13:31:18] <RohanBhangui> its not
[13:31:24] <RohanBhangui> the postion of left and top are
[13:31:24] <jyg> seems pretty simple to use, the plugin alters the targets attributes, no js errors, but i get not popups :p
[13:31:28] <RohanBhangui> at the smae postion as rohan
[13:32:33] <jyg> instantiation is super simple http://pastebin.com/ZNfFKS6U
[13:33:15] <RohanBhangui> wehn i remove the targets.each function they show up
[13:37:32] <Mariaa> hi
[13:37:38] <pace_t_zulu> hey, anyone know how to unbind/undelegate from a specific selector ... i'll try to give an example
[13:37:59] <Mariaa> how can i call a function without an even at the end of a slideshow?
[13:38:39] <pace_t_zulu> this.menu.delegate('input[type="checkbox"], input[type="radio"]', 'click', function( e ){ // do something } );
[13:39:08] <pace_t_zulu> i just want to unbind from one 'input[type="checkbox"] inside the this.menu object - leaving the rest alone
[13:39:26] <pace_t_zulu> does that make sense?
[13:42:05] <gnarf> pace_t_zulu: stopPropagation from inside that specific one
[13:42:27] <gnarf> like bind directly to that checkbox and stop its prop so it never reaches the delegate parent
[13:42:28] <gnarf> that
[13:42:56] <peeer> Is it possible to change the colour of a <p> without it having any id or class using jQuery? I guess I could use $("p").css but what if I have more then one <p>?
[13:43:01] <shoky> why not just check the target in the original handler?
[13:43:36] <pace_t_zulu> gnarf: i'll try it
[13:43:47] <shoky> peeer you need SOME way to identify the <p> you're after..
[13:44:50] <shoky> e.g. its the first one, or it has some specific parent, etc..
[13:47:44] <peeer> shoky its the 2nd one
[13:47:49] <peeer> I have 2 <p> 's
[13:47:59] <NoiseEee> the toilet is that way ---->
[13:48:05] <shoky> LoL
[13:48:05] <NoiseEee> thank you, i'll be here all night
[13:48:31] <shoky> peeer $('p:eq(1)')
[13:49:08] <peeer> that did not work
[13:49:13] <peeer> still attack both <p<
[13:49:19] <shoky> nah
[13:49:43] <peeer> it sure did
[13:50:00] <peeer> wait, my code didnt update itself
[13:50:10] <shoky> right..
[13:50:12] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/F7Gzu/
[13:54:14] <peeer> shoky, yes thank! What method should I use if want to revert if I click it again?
[13:54:52] <shoky> huh?
[13:55:03] <shoky> you didnt say anything about a click
[13:55:12] <shoky> and what does revert mean
[13:55:38] <shoky> probably .css again...
[13:55:53] <peeer> well, when I click it I change the apperance with .css and I want to use .css with other values when I click it again
[13:55:56] <peeer> like a toggle
[13:56:07] <peeer> light switch function
[13:56:14] <shoky> ?toggle
[13:56:14] <bot-t> .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/

[14:31:19] <RohanBhangui> need to reveal items oen at a time
[14:42:05] <gnarf> RohanBhangui: http://jsfiddle.net/rvWFK/4/
[14:42:15] <gnarf> the each callback first parameter is index
[14:42:21] <gnarf> so you can .delay( index * 400 )
[14:42:26] <gnarf> before the animate
[14:42:34] <RohanBhangui> thank you very much
[14:42:41] <RohanBhangui> you put a smile on my face
[14:42:44] <RohanBhangui> ;)
[14:42:49] <RohanBhangui> :)
[14:43:18] <gnarf> RohanBhangui: also, counter === index ?
[14:43:25] <gnarf> just use index ;)
[14:43:37] <RohanBhangui> can oyu fiddle it?
[14:43:41] <RohanBhangui> dont quite understand
[14:44:16] <RohanBhangui> what do you mean index?
[14:44:27] <gnarf> you had a var counter in your example
[14:44:49] <gnarf> the each callback has "index" as its first parameter which will be 0...length-1
[14:45:10] <gnarf> what I'm saying is, each is already passing you that number, don't need the "counter" variable at all
[14:45:52] <RohanBhangui> okay
[14:45:56] <RohanBhangui> cool i see that in your code
[14:46:02] <RohanBhangui> thanks alot solved my problem

[14:53:22] <rohanrhu> hi
[14:53:27] <rohanrhu> please help me
[14:53:52] <rohanrhu> i must define local variable for each .click(func)
[14:54:39] <gnarf> rohanrhu: define it inside the function
[14:54:40] <vacho> guys.
[14:54:48] <vacho> I am using find to use a class..but does not work
[14:54:56] <gnarf> ?101 @rohanrhu
[14:54:57] <bot-t> rohanrhu, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[14:54:59] <rohanrhu> @gnarf: i tried everything
[14:55:08] <gnarf> ?p @rohanrhu
[14:55:09] <bot-t> rohanrhu, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:55:21] <rohanrhu> @gnarf: no, im not newbie
[14:55:40] <rohanrhu> gnarf: this problem is mysticaly
[14:55:52] <gnarf> rohanrhu: eloquentjavascript isn't really a "newbie" book - its really frickin useful
[14:55:56] <jenia_> hello everyone.
[14:56:11] <jenia_> how can i call a method for each element in a query_set
[14:56:13] <gnarf> if you are having trouble defining a local variable, you're probably new to javascript
[14:56:15] <jenia_> let me explain
[14:56:15] <rohanrhu> jquery's click running on single thread ever
[14:56:19] <rohanrhu> but why?
[14:56:26] <gnarf> wtf does that mean?
[14:56:28] <z0ned> if i have a parent div that has 3 child div's in it, how can i "append" a 4th child div between one of the other 3, instead of at the end?
[14:56:51] <jenia_> theres a plugin called timepicker, and it works by like this $('#timepicker').timepicker("getTime")
[14:57:19] <gnarf> rohanrhu: try again, this description of your problem is insufficient for me to even guess what the problem is
[14:57:26] <jenia_> but now, i dont call it with a id reference, but rather with a class reference - so now i've got many timepickers in my get
[14:57:34] <jenia_> and that function only works on the first one
[14:57:45] <rohanrhu> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/s9p5k/
[14:58:11] <rohanrhu> gnarf: i tried everything
[14:58:24] <rohanrhu> but this problem is not normal
[14:58:26] <gnarf> rohanrhu: so what is the problem?
[14:59:09] <gnarf> that's also a decent chunk of very unreadable code
[14:59:10] <rohanrhu> gnarf: now, user selected a tab and ajax loaded to a div in that tab's parent
[14:59:33] <rohanrhu> after user selected another tab in another content area
[15:00:04] <jenia_> hey guys. i have a function that only works on a query_set
[15:00:10] <rohanrhu> after if user submit the form in previous selected tab's area
[15:00:22] <jenia_> like $('#timepicker).timepicker('getTime')
[15:00:26] <rohanrhu> ajax loads to last selected tab's area
[15:00:35] <jenia_> so, the element must be what ever jquery returned
[15:00:41] <jenia_> not the actual dom element ofcoursae
[15:00:51] <jenia_> but i call this function on many elements in the qery set
[15:00:55] <rohanrhu> so i must define local variable for each .click(func)'s func
[15:00:56] <jenia_> does anyone know how to do this
[15:01:47] <nafg> How can I get jQuery UI autocomplete to act similar to Google Chrome's address bar, in that the first item is filled out as you type, but the suggestion is selected, so that as you type it replaces it?
[15:01:59] <gnarf> rohanrhu: so define a variable
[15:02:02] <gnarf> and assign it
[15:02:09] <gnarf> like im not seeing what the problem would be
[15:02:09] <rohanrhu> but given functs to .click() always running on single variable area
[15:02:24] <gnarf> rohanrhu: do you understand how function scoping works?
[15:02:34] <rohanrhu> gnarf: yes
[15:02:35] <gnarf> every time the function is called its arguments and variables are created
[15:02:38] <rohanrhu> .click() is problem
[15:02:50] <gnarf> each invocation of the function has its own "local variables"
[15:02:58] <gnarf> so each time it is clicked, it gets its own variables
[15:03:04] <gnarf> which you can assign to whatever you want
[15:03:19] <gnarf> your problem is that you are using a selector to find things instead of just storing the result of the selection
[15:03:21] <gnarf> OR
[15:03:59] <rohanrhu> i dont understand why jquery developers do such
[15:04:00] <gnarf> that you might need to .each() in order to create yourself an extra scope to store some variables for "each thing" before calling .click
[15:04:32] <rohanrhu> gnarf: i tried everything
[15:04:44] <rohanrhu> i tried a local variable each's func
[15:04:51] <rohanrhu> and i tried $.proxy()
[15:04:57] <rohanrhu> i tried etc..
[15:05:49] <rohanrhu> now all buttons have different ids
[15:05:51] <gnarf> rohanrhu: except really understand what your problem is.... stop abusing dom selections and save your results in variables
[15:06:20] <gnarf> rohanrhu: what I'm trying to tell you is that "local variable" is not your problem... the approach to solving your ajax form issue is
[15:06:23] <rohanrhu> and .click() access them different ids
[15:06:57] <gnarf> inside of the ajaxForm call, you use a selection to find $(tiklanan_tab_button).parent().parent().find('.icerik_kutucuk')
[15:06:58] <rohanrhu> gnarf: when a click(func) call
[15:07:01] <gnarf> why don't you just store it
[15:07:06] <gnarf> inside the original click
[15:07:10] <gnarf> and then use it
[15:07:11] <gnarf> also
[15:07:17] <gnarf> .parent().parent() is bad practice
[15:07:21] <rohanrhu> change all local variables at all click(func)s
[15:07:23] <gnarf> consider use ?closest
[15:07:23] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[15:07:36] <RohanBhangui> how do you communicate what you get in a html form to jquery
[15:07:46] <rohanrhu> gnarf: yes its bad practice but it works
[15:07:49] <RohanBhangui> sry
[15:07:52] <RohanBhangui> wrong question
[15:07:53] <gnarf> ?serialize @RohanBhangui
[15:07:54] <bot-t> RohanBhangui, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[15:07:55] <gnarf> ?

[15:08:26] <gnarf> rohanrhu: barely
[15:08:29] <RohanBhangui> how do you poke people like you jsut did
[15:08:42] <gnarf> ?
[15:08:46] <RohanBhangui> im beignning to love this bot
[15:08:47] <rohanrhu> gnarf: when a click() called, that click function change all click()'s variables
[15:08:56] <gnarf> rohanrhu: bullshit
[15:08:59] <RohanBhangui> like if im browsing and you send me somehting
[15:09:10] <RohanBhangui> it like makes a sound saying there is a message wating
[15:09:13] <RohanBhangui> *waiting
[15:09:27] <rohanrhu> gnarf: why you are not helpful?
[15:09:27] <gnarf> RohanBhangui: probably just putting their name
[15:09:35] <RohanBhangui> like that
[15:09:40] <RohanBhangui> what you did right now
[15:09:41] <rohanrhu> why forcibly?
[15:09:42] <gnarf> rohanrhu: because you are stubborn and not very good at explaining your problem?
[15:09:57] <rohanrhu> gnarf: yes excuse for all
[15:10:05] <rohanrhu> gnarf: thank you
[15:10:34] <gnarf> rohanrhu: i help a lot of people with some pretty complex topics, and the simplest of them is always the hardest
[15:11:25] <gnarf> rohanrhu: if you have: var something; abc.click( function() { something = 1; }) <-- that will change
[15:11:37] <gnarf> but like if the var is inside that click function
[15:11:48] <gnarf> no other "run" of the click function will have access to it
[15:11:59] <gnarf> each invocation of the function gets its own scoped variables
[15:12:00] <gnarf> period
[15:12:04] <gnarf> and if you try to tell me it doesn't
[15:12:07] <gnarf> i call you a liar
[15:12:17] <rohanrhu> gnarf: but you dont deal for understand bad english people
[15:13:25] <gnarf> i still don't know what the >actual< problem is... I mean - it sounds to me like you need for any forms inside the ajax'ed content to be targeted at the ID that you are loading the ajax content into
[15:13:55] <gnarf> which means you just need to keep a reference to that div you dropped the content inside of for the ajax call in the callback for the ajaxForm
[15:14:11] <gnarf> cache your selectors, it will always save you time
[15:14:29] <rohanrhu> gnarf: i will cache selectors thank you
[15:15:05] <Eviltwin> ?cik
[15:15:06] <bot-t> Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[15:15:25] <rohanrhu> i can write a div for ajaxform response but why this does not work?
[15:15:25] <gnarf> you could var div = $(mytarget); $.ajax().success(function( data ) { div.html( data ).find('.ajax_form').ajaxForm({ target: div }); });
[15:15:39] <gnarf> rohanrhu: or something similar
[15:15:51] <gnarf> Eviltwin: nice factoid
[15:15:57] <gnarf> Eviltwin: i gotta try to remember that one
[15:16:43] <gnarf> rohanrhu: also, I'm not trying to be unhelpful, I'm actually trying to help by telling you that your approach/assumptions are already wrong from what I can tell from your description of your problem.
[15:18:23] <rohanrhu> gnarf: thank you

[15:22:21] <RohanBhangui> nvm
[15:30:00] <krazyj> hey guys… i'm appending a string with HTML to an existing div using a jQuery function inside of the <body> tag…. when i inspect the page using Chrome WebKit Inspector, the highlighted area appears in the correct space, but the content i appended with jQuery is placed incorrectly. any ideas? image: http://screencast.com/t/SoOnuEIy
[15:31:02] <Koganei> krazyj: your image might be too big for the div?
[15:32:05] <Koganei> that happens to me when I float elements in too small a div
[15:32:10] <krazyj> Koganei: the code works… when i hard code the same HTML in there, it's fine
[15:32:14] <krazyj> i'll double check though
[15:32:54] <krazyj> Koganei: heh. the image doesn't fit.
[15:32:55] <krazyj> ;) thanks.
[15:33:18] <Koganei> ^_^ np
[15:34:16] <krazyj> Koganei: why would WebKit Inspector highlight the area it *should* be in… but the content is entirely outside that area?
[15:34:59] <Koganei> cause it's highlighting the div.room-filter
[15:35:11] <Koganei> not .img.room-filter-icon
[15:35:20] <Koganei> when it highlights content
[15:35:24] <Koganei> it highlights the container
[15:35:57] <Koganei> content as in non tags
[15:36:15] <newbie|2> gnarf: sorry thank you
[15:36:29] <chilversc> meh, all this fancy new html5 input types and they never though to add hints for the max dimesions for an image

[15:45:39] <krazyj> is there any way to redraw a div so it'll recalculate it's geometries (height / width) after you .append some elements into it?
[15:55:59] <nafg> krazyj: What is its height value? Normally it happens automatically.

[16:05:28] <benv> i read the readme
[16:05:30] <benv> that's why im here
[16:05:31] <Mariaa> event*
[16:05:47] <benv> grunt custom:-ajax,-css,-dimensions,-effects,-offset
[16:05:49] <benv> from the readme
[16:05:54] <gnarf> benv: so "grunt custom:-effects" would be like build without effects
[16:05:54] <Mariaa> anyone?
[16:06:10] <benv> gnarf: you are shitting me
[16:06:13] <Whirl3d_> Mariaa, there are 1.8 million slideshows out there
[16:06:34] <benv> ok, i know what it does, i am just saying, it's not actually writing any files
[16:06:44] <gnarf> benv: http://cl.ly/3x191K2U1Y2x1B1G3F0k
[16:07:19] <Whirl3d_> and though my crystal ball is in 98% accurate at defining which slideshow you are using and how you are using it...it's in the shop at the moment
[16:07:26] <gnarf> benv: built a dist/jquery.js for me
[16:07:29] <raj> Eviltwin, thank you
[16:07:29] <benv> here's mine
[16:07:30] <benv> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/421333/Screenshots/8ao3z0r5j8wy.png
[16:07:43] <benv> for any combination of custom:
[16:08:24] <gnarf> benv: just verify you're on jquery/master ?
[16:08:40] <gnarf> also - npm install - for good measure?
[16:09:09] <benv> i just pulled from master 15 mins ago
[16:09:15] <Koganei> gnarf: I heard you built 'yoyo' type animation functions for 1.8, like some way to call css() or animate(), get some css map of the difference between the current and older css so that you can call css() or animate() on it later and it goes back to the way it was.
[16:09:29] <Koganei> is there a way I can take a look at that?
[16:09:39] <benv> gnarf: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/421333/Screenshots/qxbc2mxh_raq.png
[16:10:07] <gnarf> Koganei: nothing that I'm aware of
[16:10:31] <Koganei> hm, I'll ask Whirl3d_. He might've been talking about swap
[16:10:43] <gnarf> Koganei: hrm
[16:10:50] <gnarf> benv: sorry
[16:10:51] <mzarella> good afternoon #jquery
[16:10:57] <gnarf> benv: um...
[16:11:17] <mzarella> just wondering if it's possible to call any jquery method (such as .ajaxSuccess) like $.<method>
[16:11:27] <gnarf> benv: out of curiositiy, if you npm install -g grunt - does it still have the same problem?
[16:11:49] <gnarf> benv: I've actually not heard of any issues with this, but can you jump over to -dev ?
[16:11:53] <benv> should i use sudo
[16:11:56] <gnarf> benv: #jquery-dev
[16:12:07] <gnarf> benv: nope
[16:12:25] <benv> ok
[16:12:27] <benv> it was grunt
[16:12:29] <benv> cool beans, thanks
[16:12:41] <gnarf> benv: so npm install -g grunt, then using the global grunt works?
[16:12:45] <snover> mzarella: no. don’t use those. they are dumb.
[16:13:02] <benv> yea
[16:13:24] <gnarf> benv: out of curiositity - does using the grunt in node_modules still cause the issue?
[16:13:32] <gnarf> because I'd like to log this bug somewhere
[16:13:36] <Whirl3d_> Koganei, you are gonna get me in trouble. LOL  I said (or meant) that jstween has the implementation of yoyo and I also said that gnarf wrote the animation engine in 1.8 which (coincidentally)  was a lot like jstween so you might be able to find the answer in 1.8...my bad
[16:13:37] <gnarf> thats a little strange
[16:14:06] <benv> gnarf yea
[16:14:18] <gnarf> Koganei: you could actually hook on the "start" of an animation now and look at all of its tweens and record their "start" state
[16:14:43] <gnarf> benv: would you mind filing a ticket on that on bugs.jquery.com ?
[16:14:56] <gnarf> benv: i'll make sure the right people take a look at fixing it :)
[16:15:10] <sia77_> I'm using the expand/collaps feature in the form API, and it sometimes doesn't work. When I look closely, it simply won't insert <a href='#'></a> around the <legend></lengend>, and because of that selector won't match, and it won't work. Does anybody have any idea why that might be a case?
[16:15:30] <gnarf> or deciding that it was just a broken way to use grunt and add something in bolder letters about -g flag for grunt
[16:16:04] <gnarf> Koganei: also
[16:16:13] <gnarf> Koganei: assuming you have some set of properties you are animating
[16:16:18] <gnarf> "props" lets say
[16:17:07] <nafg> How can I get jQuery UI autocomplete to act similar to Google Chrome's address bar, in that the first item is filled out as you type, but the suggestion is selected, so that as you type it replaces it?
[16:17:11] <benv> gnarf
[16:17:12] <benv> so how about this
[16:17:14] <gnarf> you could var orig = {}, prop; for ( prop in props ) { orig[ prop ] = element.css( prop ); } -- then store it
[16:17:14] <benv> if i build -ajax
[16:17:18] <benv> the ajax is still in the build
[16:17:25] <benv> it seems like no matter what combination of params i use, the file is always the same
[16:18:16] <gnarf> benv: hrm
[16:18:28] <gnarf> benv: i really wish rwaldron were around
[16:18:32] <gnarf> he worked on all that
[16:18:36] <gnarf> i haven't played much with it
[16:19:24] <gnarf> benv: file a ticket on it - its broken
[16:19:39] <benv> bummer
[16:19:46] <benv> i wanted to know what a minimal version of jquery looked like
[16:19:48] <benv> filesize wise
[16:20:06] <gnarf> benv: i believe it was down to 22k gziped with all optionals removed
[16:20:21] <gnarf> but we haven't modularized everything
[16:20:22] <benv> so 50%
[16:20:30] <benv> er
[16:20:34] <benv> 1/3 roughly
[16:20:36] <benv> ok
[16:20:36] <gnarf> yeah
[16:20:51] <gnarf> 33% savings for stripping css, offset, dimensions, ajax, and effects
[16:21:10] <gnarf> i think queue might of been in there too
[16:21:16] <gnarf> but that module is tiny
[16:21:44] <gnarf> this is really just step #1 on the path to a more modular jQuery
[16:21:54] <gnarf> so excuse its pre-release bumpiness :)
[16:22:56] <benv> effects is yea
[16:22:57] <nafg> Is this the wrong place for query ui questions?
[16:22:58] <benv> err
[16:22:58] <benv> yea
[16:23:57] <gnarf> nafg: jquery ui support is here
[16:23:58] <kevintje> hey guys
[16:24:09] <gnarf> if you have a question about actually working on something in ui, take it to #jqueryui-dev
[16:24:16] <kevintje> I've got a quick question..
[16:24:39] <nafg> gnarf: Did you see my question (it may have gotten drowned in the conversation)?
[16:25:38] <nafg> How can I get jQuery UI autocomplete to act similar to Google Chrome's address bar, in that the first item is filled out as you type, but the suggestion is selected, so that as you type it replaces it?
[16:25:44] <gnarf> nafg: hrm
[16:25:48] <gnarf> lemme compare
[16:25:50] <kevintje> IF I want to add a style to jquery, are css3 properties allready defined? EG: $("#div").css("box-shadow:", "10px 10px 5px red");
[16:25:52] <gnarf> it shouldn't be too hard
[16:26:17] <raj> why does 60<= seconds <= 119 never hit? http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/KfueV/
[16:26:32] <gnarf> nafg: the behavior i thought you were talking about already happens
[16:26:48] <gnarf> aha
[16:27:05] <nafg> gnarf: I have autoFocus=true. docs say default focus handler populates input only on focus triggered by keyboard event (seemingly to exclusion of autofocus)
[16:27:08] <kevintje> IF I want to add a style to jquery, are css3 properties allready defined? EG: $("#div").css("box-shadow:", "10px 10px 5px red");
[16:27:29] <gnarf> nafg: google seems to be doing some strange black magic there to make that "shady filled in" part
[16:27:30] <nafg> So I need to add a handler to focus event when it's auto triggered
[16:27:58] <raj> oh sorry, I meant why does the 'else' clause never hit
[16:27:59] <nafg> Or else a key handler
[16:28:02] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/KfueV/
[16:28:09] <nafg> gnarf: What shady part? It just becomes selected text.
[16:28:18] <raj> it stays on 60<= seconds<=119 indefinitely
[16:28:23] <gnarf> nafg: on google.com/ ?
[16:28:51] <nafg> So you type www.ai and I have aish.com so then you have www.ai{sh.com} where {...} represents selection.
[16:29:01] <gnarf> when i type "jQuery con" i get this: http://cl.ly/030G1o0k2I1X001f1C2o
[16:29:03] <nafg> So then if I type s, I have ais{h.com}
[16:29:04] <nafg> That
[16:29:08] <nafg> 's what I want.
[16:29:30] <gnarf> nafg: oh - you mean chromes location bar
[16:29:34] <gnarf> not googles search bar
[16:29:57] <gnarf> googles search bar seems to be "underlaying" the first suggestion in the input box --- i.e. its transparent and has the text suggested behind it
[16:30:01] <nafg> Right, that's what I said
[16:30:15] <nafg> Google chrome address bar
[16:30:24] <gnarf> nafg: I would suggest against trying to manipulate the selection caret in text inputs - it becomes a headache
[16:30:26] <benv> gnarf
[16:30:27] <benv> made a ticket
[16:30:30] <benv> was rejected as spam
[16:30:30] <gnarf> but if you want to go down the route to figure it out
[16:30:38] <benv> i dont have an id or anything
[16:30:38] <gnarf> benv: :(
[16:30:45] <benv> did it create it but flag it?
[16:30:47] <benv> or just toss it out
[16:30:48] <gnarf> i dunno
[16:30:50] <gnarf> ajpiano: ^^^^
[16:31:27] <benv> anyways, here's the content
[16:31:29] <benv> if someone else wants to build
[16:31:29] <benv> https://gist.github.com/c7b5f70fc5cba4520e4d
[16:31:32] <benv> er create ticket
[16:31:33] <nafg> gnarf: Ah, then maybe I should try to solve the real goal differently. Though http://www.ajaxdaddy.com/demo-jquery-autocomplete.html seems to do a fine job
[16:31:45] <nafg> It's not the UI combo though.
[16:32:06] <gnarf> nafg: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/mask/ui/jquery.ui.mask.js#L74-109
[16:32:58] <gnarf> nafg: thats some code for manipulating carets
[16:33:09] <gnarf> nafg: I might be able to put together something using UI that does that
[16:35:50] <gnarf> nafg: like an autocomplete extension
[16:36:05] <gnarf> nafg: or maybe scott already has one
[16:36:31] <gnarf> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui-extensions/tree/master/autocomplete
[16:36:36] <gnarf> look at autoSelect ?
[16:36:59] <kevinnewesil> anybody that can help me? :)
[16:37:48] <gnarf> or even selectFirst
[16:37:54] <gnarf> one of those might do what you want already nafg
[16:38:14] <gnarf> ?q @kevinnewesil
[16:38:15] <bot-t> kevinnewesil, #2758 ([autocomplete] Suggestion: allow the 'q' parameter be ... - Opened 3 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/2758
[16:38:24] <gnarf> ?ask @kevinnewesil
[16:38:24] <bot-t> kevinnewesil, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:38:35] <kevinnewesil> IF I want to add a style to jquery, are css3 properties allready defined? EG: $("#div").css("box-shadow:", "10px 10px 5px red");
[16:39:03] <gnarf> kevinnewesil: in the current versions, you need to do your own vendor prefix checking
[16:39:11] <gnarf> but there are cssHooks for most of these
[16:39:19] <gnarf> ?g jQuery cssHooks box shadow
[16:39:20] <bot-t> gnarf, Correct way to animate box-shadow with jQuery - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4133366/correct-way-to-animate-box-shadow-with-jquery
[16:39:35] <gnarf> kevinnewesil: https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-cssHooks/blob/master/boxshadow.js
[16:39:36] <nafg_> gnarf: one of these == one of what?
[16:39:38] <kevinnewesil> let me see
[16:40:28] <gnarf> nafg_: there are a bunch of "Extensions" there for autocomplete
[16:40:36] <kevinnewesil> isn't it easier to at a class with .attr for example red and then define the style in de css?
[16:40:38] <gnarf> I think that selectFirst or autoSelect might actually do what you want
[16:40:57] <Eviltwin> kevinnewesil: see addClass
[16:41:01] <Eviltwin> kevinnewesil: see ?addClass
[16:41:02] <bot-t> kevinnewesil, .addClass(className): Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[16:41:15] <gnarf> kevinnewesil: yes actually - using addClass / removeClass are generally better than setting css props directly
[16:41:25] <gnarf> but sometimes you gotta get all manual
[16:41:26] <gnarf> :)
[16:41:30] <nafg_> gnarf: What are those? config fields? I don't see them in the docs.
[16:41:41] <kevinnewesil> Okay then I know what I'm up to now then, thank you.
[16:41:47] <gnarf> nafg_: they are extensions to the autocomplete widget developed by scott
[16:41:54] <gnarf> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui-extensions/tree/master/autocomplete
[16:43:41] <nafg_> gnarf: Just looked at the code, doesn't seem so
[16:44:57] <nafg_> Seems like select means focus/highlight in the menu, not insert it highlighted into the input.
[16:45:21] <nafg_> Anyway I think it wouldn't be too bad to handle all focus events. Basically:
[16:46:43] <nafg_> Always focus causes following behavior: If input's unselected text is prefix of focused item, clear the selection and append the remaining text, highlighted.
[16:46:52] <nafg_> causes == would cause
[16:47:19] <gnarf> nafg_: there are two events
[16:47:24] <gnarf> i think "select" is the one you want
[16:47:48] <gnarf> nafg_: also the autocompleteopen for when the box originally pops
[16:47:59] <nafg_> I just realized, scott's select doesn't mean focus in the menu, it means click in the menu, i.e. choose
[16:48:06] <gnarf> but you could hook on those and make an extension that adds this option to your own version of autocomplete
[16:49:11] <nafg_> gnarf: select means an item is chosen. That's not what I want.
[16:49:16] <nafg_> Here's the ultimate goal:
[16:49:23] <nafg_> I just wrote a POS for a client.
[16:49:42] <Eviltwin> I just wrote this for nobody: http://jsfiddle.net/W7Z52/7/show/
[16:50:07] <nafg_> When the client types in certain autocomplete fields, they should be able to just type the item's unique prefix followed immediately by TAB.
[16:51:16] <gnarf> nafg_: sounds like you're going to need to extend autocomplete and hook into its events... im not aware of any pre-built plugin with the behavior you're looking for, but if you end up writing it i suggest releasing it :)
[16:51:18] <Es0teric> how do i do validation for multiple input fields?
[16:51:26] <nafg_> The truth is, I'm not even sure this approach suffices, even if I set delay to 0.
[16:51:27] <Es0teric> like what if i want to check to see if the fields are empy
[16:51:45] <nafg_> gnarf: Why an extension, why not just regular event handlers?
[16:52:25] <zanberdo> okay, stupid question, but how do I register a click event for all input where the name is the same? I've tried $(function() { ${"input[name=foo]")click(function() { alert('foo'); }); }); but nothing happens.
[16:52:51] <coldhead> $('input[name="foo"]') ?
[16:52:58] <someprimetime> what's a ternary operator look like with no else condition?
[16:52:58] <coldhead> inside a document ready?
[16:53:03] <someprimetime> maxWidth = width ? width > maxWidth : '';
[16:53:03] <coldhead> or do you need to use ?on
[16:53:04] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[16:53:34] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Ternary operators always evaluate to some value
[16:53:42] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: ah ok thanks
[16:53:49] <Eviltwin> So they need to have both the "if" and the "else"
[16:53:55] <someprimetime> gotcha thanks Eviltwin
[16:54:25] <nafg_> gnarf: If delay == 0, does the menu display still get deferred to a timeout event where t=0, or is it opened in the key event handler?
[16:54:38] <gnarf> nafg_: an extension has access to the full widget prototype letting you extend things in better ways
[16:54:58] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Looks like maybe you want if (width > maxWidth) maxWidth = width ?
[16:55:09] <gnarf> nafg_: you can hook/override internal functions too
[16:55:13] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: yeah that's what i had just looking for ways to shorten it
[16:55:15] <someprimetime> thanks though :)
[16:55:36] <gnarf> nafg_: and I'm not sure about the delay option, tbh - I haven't spent much time in autocomplete
[16:55:43] <zanberdo> coldhead, I tried that but it's still not working.  I've tired with and without single and double quotes with no luck... I can register it by id, but since the id has to be unique and I don't know the unique value until after the page is loaded, I can't use id, unless of course I could use a wild card for the id, but I tried that and it didn't work either
[16:55:49] <Eviltwin> maxWidth = Math.max(width, maxWidth) ?
[16:55:50] <gnarf> i would imagine it gets delayed to setTimeout( , 0 )
[16:56:20] <zanberdo> coldhead, oh, and I'm not using 1.7+, I'm still working with 1.6.1
[16:57:13] <nafg_> gnarf: Just checked source, it's always a setTimeout. So now the question is how Chrome implements a setTImeout with t=0.
[16:57:35] <iateadonut> kind of looking for a way to do a min-right;
[16:57:41] <coldhead> ?p @ zanberdo
[16:57:42] <bot-t> zanberdo, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:57:55] <nafg_> The question is, can the TAB/blur be handled before the menu is opened, causing the autofocus-triggerd focus handler to never get called.
[16:58:04] <zanberdo> coldhead, on it. one moment please
[16:58:08] <iateadonut> like, if the right edge of my div is beyond the browser space, make right: 20px;
[16:59:16] <DraXe> Hi guys! Why in wordpress it shows version of jquery files? for example jquery.js?ver=1.7.1
[16:59:41] <DraXe> Is it safe to remove ?ver=1.7.1 part?
[17:00:03] <danheberden> why not keep it so you know what version the file is?
[17:00:16] <DraXe> i can check version in the file
[17:00:37] <danheberden> sounds like you have your answer
[17:01:37] <DraXe> danheberden I want to combine 15 js files into 1 JS. However, when i do it, firebug under NET tab shows that few versions of primary.js are loaded. for example, primary.js then primary.js?ver=1.7.1 and so on
[17:01:38] <zanberdo> coldhead, nevermind. I'm a complete idiot. the object in question is not in fact an input object! /facepalm
[17:01:39] <iateadonut> i would not.
[17:01:50] <coldhead> zanberdo: good work :)
[17:02:00] <coldhead> zanberdo: you can still use live() if you don't have on() yet
[17:02:03] <coldhead> if you ever need it
[17:02:06] <coldhead> good luck
[17:02:10] <iateadonut> but you could check within the code, do this at the command line:  grep -R '1.7.1' ./*
[17:02:15] <zanberdo> coldhead, thanks. I'll look up .live
[17:02:20] <coldhead> ?live
[17:02:20] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[17:02:28] <iateadonut> and that will show you lines in your files that have a reference to ver
[17:02:29] <iateadonut> no.
[17:02:30] <iateadonut> sorry.
[17:02:54] <mzarella> snover: don't use what?
[17:02:55] <iateadonut> do grep -R '$_GET[\'ver\']' or something like that.
[17:03:00] <rainervonvielen> hello there. I have a problem with hide("explode") (jquery-ui). but I can't build it up in jsfiddle. it's working great there, but not in my project.
[17:03:01] <mzarella> $.<method> stuff?
[17:03:11] <iateadonut> DraXe - look through the wp php files and makes sure it doesn't use that value anywhere, which it probably does.
[17:03:41] <snover> $.fn.ajaxSuccess etc.
[17:03:45] <snover> mzarella: ^
[17:04:00] <gnarf> nafg_: "next available frame"
[17:04:21] <gnarf> nafg_: which in reality is usually averaged/capped at ~4ms
[17:04:21] <DraXe> yes, I am trying to do that. Also, i noticed that NET tab shows that it actually loads multiple times the same primary.js. why is that?
[17:05:24] <nafg_> gnarf: I guess this whole approach is not viable then. So maybe i should simply have a separate key handler --- independent from autocomplete --- that gets the first
[17:05:32] <nafg_> possible option and does the select stuff.
[17:05:46] <DraXe> yes, I am trying to do that. Also, i noticed that NET tab shows that it actually loads multiple times the same primary.js. why is that? Should it load just once and then use cached version?
[17:05:51] <gnarf> nafg_: are you using an array based source, or ajax?
[17:06:01] <nafg_> Ajax
[17:06:01] <gnarf> nafg_: if you are already using the "function" based source option
[17:06:09] <gnarf> you could prolly just hack it in there before your response()
[17:06:26] <gnarf> and set some .data() to what the "tab" should complete to
[17:07:20] <Es0teric> how do i check if a input/textarea field is empty?
[17:07:22] <gnarf> nafg_: that link i gave you earlier for _caret in my mask is a really good start for tweaking caret position (selection)
[17:07:52] <DraXe> can anyone explain why NET shows that same JS file was loaded 2 times? Shouldn't it use cache second time?
[17:08:42] <nafg_> gnarf: Yes it is, although currently I only have to support Chrome and the begin is defined so I can probably shave off a lot of lines.
[17:08:46] <nafg_> It's a url source.
[17:09:14] <gnarf> nafg_: you can dig into autocomplete to see how it internally converts a url to the functions
[17:09:23] <nafg_> So it's unfortunate to make two HTTP calls but seems there's no way out.
[17:09:27] <gnarf> but use a funciton based source
[17:09:36] <gnarf> because then you can do it in one ajax request
[17:09:46] <nafg_> Anyway it wouldn't help, because again I realized that doing this via autocomplete is fundamentally wrong.
[17:09:49] <gnarf> and when you get your response, do your shit with the first option, then give all the options to ui
[17:10:19] <nafg_> If you press s+TAB fast enough, the autocomplete may not get triggered at all --- or did I misunderstand?
[17:11:04] <nafg_> You said "next available frame" --- not sure precisely what that implies.
[17:11:39] <gnarf> well you can defer your completion of their tab until you've received the query results
[17:11:58] <gnarf> but yes - you have to be careful to avoid the race
[17:13:11] <gnarf> again, the amount of "extra" going on here makes it seem like a good target for an extension to autocomplete
[17:13:26] <gnarf> but
[17:13:29] <gnarf> whatevers
[17:13:51] <gnarf> if you only need it in one place, or want to copy/pasta it everywhere else, continue on with trying to put it in the events :)
[17:14:23] <nafg_> gnarf: First of all, you don't have to copy-pase, you can have a function that adds the handler.
[17:14:39] <nafg_> But anyway can you explain " you can defer your completion of their tab until you've received the query results"
[17:15:00] <nafg_> Doesn't blur immediately cancel the menu?
[17:16:02] <nafg_> So the question is, can the browser handle blur before it handles the "searching" setTimeout callback.
[17:16:49] <nafg_> But actually my solution is not so simple either.
[17:16:55] <nafg_> Have to run now though sorry
[17:17:01] <gnarf> it could - and I'm not really aware of the race inside of autocomplete
[17:17:10] <gnarf> like if it actually cancels any requests on blur
[17:17:13] <gnarf> but i doubt it does
[17:17:36] <gnarf> but you could just log that they tabbed, and then find which element they should have selected after the responses return
[17:18:00] <gnarf> all this state storage/etc makes it an even better target for an extension
[17:18:06] <gnarf> as you get access to the autocomplete widget instance
[17:18:18] <gnarf> which gives you a nice place for local storage of state information
[17:19:18] <bartmax> ?.data
[17:19:19] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[17:19:34] <bartmax> ? .data()
[17:19:35] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[17:19:42] <bartmax> doesn't have a getter ?
[17:23:02] <gnarf> is a getter
[17:23:35] <gnarf> ?js var o = $({}); o.data("test", "test"); console.log( o.data("test"), o.data() );
[17:23:38] <bot-t> gnarf: "test" {"test": "test"}
[17:24:17] <gnarf> .data(key) is a getter, and .data() returns the whole data object
[17:29:12] <mzarella> is this valid? https://gist.github.com/5ec448aa24b65868c574
[17:32:01] <mzarella> chrome dev tools says that there is an "uncaught syntaxerror: unexpected identifier", this message is flashed right below line 57
[17:32:46] <mzarella> the semicolon
[17:32:51] <mzarella> firebug pointed straight to it
[17:33:00] <mzarella> one character after it
[17:33:40] <mzarella> i'm making an $.ajax call
[17:33:47] <mzarella> the server is sending back json
[17:34:00] <mzarella> is there some way to drop into a console in the browser and sift through the data
[17:34:05] <mzarella> see what can be done with it
[17:35:39] <Dr-Bombay> you can set a breakpoint on your ajax completion function
[17:36:17] <mythril> I'm writing a jQuery plugin that has events, and I'm wondering how I can specify the 'default' behavior that happens when the event is triggered, so that when a handler attached at a later time calls .preventDefault(), my default behaviour is actually supressed
[17:36:48] <mzarella> thanks Dr-Bombay
[17:36:51] <mzarella> just what i needed
[17:38:15] <Eviltwin> mythril: http://api.jquery.com/event.isDefaultPrevented/
[17:38:31] <Eviltwin> Not sure it's good to overload that though
[17:39:14] <mythril> Eviltwin: that looks like it will work, ty
[17:39:24] <mythril> what do you mean overload?
[17:39:48] <Eviltwin> I mean preventing default means stop what the browser would normally do
[17:40:03] <Eviltwin> You're changing it to mean something else
[17:40:08] <mythril> Eviltwin: this is a completely custom event
[17:40:22] <mythril> meaning it has no browser analog
[17:40:48] <Eviltwin> Probably fine then
[17:42:05] <Dr-Bombay> always glad to point out the obvious
[17:47:49] <Draxel> wp_enqueue_script('test', home_url('misc/js/test.js'), 'jquery', false, false); can I remove 'jquery', false, false part?
[17:47:51] <Draxel> :)
[17:49:34] <Draxel> anyone? what does it mean?
[17:50:01] <snover> Draxel: that is a wordpress question, not a jquery question.
[17:50:33] <cassarani> possibly an odd question, but I'm using .slideUp() to hide a div that has some top- and bottom-padding. Is there a way to keep the padding constant (e.g. 1em) during the animation, until the very end?
[17:50:48] <cassarani> right now the padding gradually goes to 0 as the animation is performed, which looks really odd
[17:51:53] <coldhead> cassarani: you can use ?animate // and control exactly which properties are animated
[17:51:54] <bot-t> cassarani, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[17:52:19] <cassarani> coldhead: so you'd recommend re-implementing slideUp() in terms of animate myself?
[17:52:30] <Eviltwin> What you're asking for isn't slideUp
[17:52:34] <Eviltwin> It's animating only the height to 0
[17:52:51] <Eviltwin> hideUp animates all properties that can affect the resulting height of the element to 0
[17:52:55] <coldhead> slideUp is just for convenience. if it's being incovenient just use animate()
[17:53:23] <Whirl3d_> Eviltwin, would it be difficul to create a plugin that would allow you to create an object which dynamically reported properties for a "target" element.   So I could find the width of this object's target element by   var w=obj.width();  and the instantion of it would be var mirr=$.mirror(targ, props) or $.(this).mirror(props)  ?
[17:56:47] <cassarani> coldhead, Eviltwin: I understand that, however how can I get the effect I want? animating height to 0, then when that's done (but before the object is hidden), animate the padding to 0
[17:56:50] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d_: I don't understand the question
[17:57:29] <Eviltwin> cassarani: .animate({height: 0}).animate({paddingTop: 0, paddingBottom: 0}, function() { $(this).hide() });
[17:59:11] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/D2X68/33/
[17:59:56] <Eviltwin> That doesn't help
[18:00:08] <cassarani> Eviltwin: unfortunately after the first animation completes, something weird happens where the div disappears, but its contents show up, until the padding is also set to 0
[18:00:12] <cassarani> Eviltwin: v. bizarre
[18:02:57] <Eviltwin> cassarani: http://jsfiddle.net/ZsRPB/
[18:04:17] <cassarani> Eviltwin: good point, though I think I'll end up just using .children().hide() in the callback from the height: 0 animation because it looks nicer
[18:04:41] <mythril> Eviltwin: that event thing didn't work, jQuery fires handlers in the order they are added, meaning my internal handler always get's called before any other handler has a chance to call preventDefault()
[18:05:15] <rodd> Do events stay attached to elements after I get its content, insert elsewhere and then remove it? Ex.: var c = $('#el').html(); $('#a').append(c); $('#el').remove()
[18:07:19] <mythril> rodd: I don't see why they would, c contains a string, not a document fragment (as far as I'm aware)
[18:08:51] <mythril> rodd: if it's behaving like the events stick around maybe you are inadvertently using delegation
[18:10:14] <mythril> rodd: if you want the events to stick around may be you should intentionally use delegation :)
[18:10:30] <rodd> mythril hm yeah I will do some tests
[18:11:24] <raj> shoky, I've got one [hopefully last] question regarding the timer
[18:11:33] <raj> when you getta chance
[18:12:22] <rodd> mythril yeah they will no longer have events attached
[18:26:45] <rodd> "As shown in the discussion for .append(), normally when an element is inserted somewhere in the DOM, it is moved from its old location."
[18:26:52] <rodd> Nice, I wasn't aware of that
[18:28:27] <coldhead> rodd: i didn't learn that for many years
[18:28:36] <coldhead> i'm not very good at jQuery
[18:29:22] <rodd> Yeah, funny how by playing around with selectors, ajax, and other manipulation one may think knows a lot about jQuery
[18:30:48] <coldhead> to our credit, append doesn't necessarily have connotations of moving
[18:47:40] <devians> hey, im cloning a pile of form items into a $('<form>') object, and running serializeArray over it. however, this doesnt seem to take the selected values in dropdowns with it. is there a better way to pull a pile of elements on page together to serialize them, without wrapping them in a single form input?
[18:48:44] <rodd> funny how the documentation doesn't mention append() to be able to 'move' items
[18:49:43] <coldhead> i guess they imply it by not mentioning clone()ing
[18:49:48] <coldhead> it's subtle
[18:49:49] <raj> why am I getting an error here? http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/t4MRN/
[18:51:00] <coldhead> some kind of bug?
[18:51:10] <devians> sigh. yeah its clone
[18:51:35] <devians> if i go $('somelement').clone().val() it gives me a different result to $('someelement').val()
[18:51:54] <coldhead> you're missing a leading $, raj
[18:51:56] <raj> something more detailed would be nice :)
[18:52:02] <coldhead> you need $(function instead of (function
[18:52:10] <coldhead> also fuck that syntax, use .ready()
[18:52:29] <raj> coldhead, it works in my live site without a leading $
[18:52:39] <raj> it's getting called with jQuery
[18:53:00] <coldhead> oh i see
[18:54:23] <raj> so why might this be happening?
[18:54:40] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/t4MRN/1/
[18:54:49] <coldhead> you need a semicolon before the (function
[18:55:01] <coldhead> because ugh i don't even know
[18:55:13] <coldhead> because of all that nonsense people memorise about semis
[18:55:46] <raj> omg, that was the reason
[18:55:46] <raj> wow
[18:57:39] <mrgoose> how can I apply a .change(function to multiple selectors at the same time?
[18:58:21] <raj> thank you coldhead
[19:00:07] <coldhead> mrgoose: $('#athing, .something, :input').change(...) ?
[19:00:27] <raj> ok, but now for my real question, if a card that was clicked is then clicked again, I want timer1 to pick up where it left off on that card http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/t4MRN/5/
[19:00:49] <raj> resume, so to speak
[19:01:42] <coldhead> tricky
[19:02:44] <mrgoose> coldhead: thanks
[19:02:45] <raj> if the "plugin" can be made to do that with a 'resume' method, that'd be great
[19:03:56] <mbleigh> hi, i have a bug/issue with jquery ui dragging and i'm wondering if anyone can think of a workaround
[19:04:12] <coldhead> raj: can you add pause and resume methods?
[19:04:25] <coldhead> which store the current value somewhere and retrieve it when necessary?
[19:04:45] <Dr-Bombay> raj: it looks like you're saving the time at which the element was clicked, instead of the total time that element has been active
[19:04:50] <raj> yeah, I'd like it to store that value on the card
[19:04:51] <Dr-Bombay> and the latter is the thing you really care about
[19:05:02] <mbleigh> i'm building an app in which items are dragged from the main document into an iframe. while the iframefix works great for keeping the dragging handle, an interesting problem occurs: the events triggered in the iframe appear to be triggered with pageX and pageY set from the parent doc, not relative to the iframe
[19:05:12] <raj> Dr-Bombay, well, the way I'm doing it it'll be more accurate
[19:05:23] <raj> I'd just just update the timeend
[19:05:28] <Dr-Bombay> accurately tracking something you don't actually want to track?
[19:05:53] <raj> well, I'm just using the timestart and the current time now and subtracting
[19:06:29] <Es0teric> how do i check if multiple input fields are empty?
[19:06:40] <Dr-Bombay> and I think that's why it isn't working. If you activate a card, then deactivated it, and activate it again, it doesn't matter when it was active before
[19:06:46] <Dr-Bombay> only how long it was activated
[19:07:18] <raj> oh, I see what you mean
[19:07:28] <raj> but can't I store the previous diff and then just begin a new one that I add to it?
[19:08:13] <Dr-Bombay> on deactivation you can store the total time that the card has been active
[19:08:33] <Dr-Bombay> if you want to store a list of activation times you can do that too
[19:09:04] <raj> yeah, something along those lines
[19:09:07] <rodd> damn soccer game
[19:09:08] <raj> but I seriously have no idea how to do that
[19:09:12] <Dr-Bombay> I mean a list of activation time spans
[19:09:28] <Dr-Bombay> raj: a time interval can be represented as a number
[19:09:34] <raj> yep
[19:09:36] <raj> just need the seconds
[19:09:37] <Dr-Bombay> so...
[19:09:54] <Dr-Bombay> so what's the mystery
[19:10:18] <raj> Dr-Bombay, how to implement what we just discussed
[19:10:40] <Dr-Bombay> you know how to attach data to an element and read it back, you're just not attaching the right data
[19:10:58] <raj> i'm not attaching it to the right element either
[19:11:05] <raj> I should attach it to card, no?
[19:11:14] <Dr-Bombay> yes
[19:12:00] <raj> so timer should take an additional argument for a selector?
[19:12:59] <Eviltwin> You want it to pick up where it left off?
[19:13:05] <raj> yessir
[19:13:12] <Eviltwin> Both timers of just the left one?
[19:14:03] <raj> just the left one
[19:14:05] <raj> just the one that resets
[19:14:19] <raj> the other one should continue anyway
[19:14:38] <Dr-Bombay> eviltwin: imagine a test app where there are separate time limits for each question and for the whole test
[19:14:39] <raj> i think a big pause button will be useful too, to pause both timers...but I'll ask about that afterwards I suppose
[19:18:04] <Whirl3d_> so, using the pattern you gave me yesterday, Eviltwin, i created this version of my "mirror" object and it's obvious that there's a disconnect somewhere for me. http://jsfiddle.net/qjKD2/15/
[19:36:35] <raj> Eviltwin, could I bother you to modify this so it actually works as such?
[19:40:16] <Eviltwin> raj: Already working on it
[19:43:06] <Eviltwin> raj: I structured it a little differently: http://jsfiddle.net/aSfEB/
[19:46:49] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d_: http://jsfiddle.net/qjKD2/17/
[19:47:25] <gaius65> how can I remove some elements from my current jquery object?
[19:47:48] <gaius65> like $('div').without('div.not-me')
[19:47:53] <gaius65> .without
[19:48:55] <Eviltwin> see ?.not
[19:48:56] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[19:49:44] <Whirl3d_> eviltwin did you click update? or is the change really subtle?
[19:50:02] <Eviltwin> Really subtle
[19:50:52] <Whirl3d_> so in your constructor, you didn't return the object
[19:51:13] <Whirl3d_> wait, neither idid i...lol
[19:51:17] <Whirl3d_> what is the difference?
[19:51:51] <Whirl3d_> oh and it's not working either
[19:52:42] <coldhead> in your face, Eviltwin
[19:52:57] <gaius65> Eviltwin: ah, thanks
[19:52:59] <Whirl3d_> unless this is that miserable image width bs..
[19:53:02] <Eviltwin> Well I'm still not sure what it's supposed to do
[19:53:13] <Eviltwin> But it produces a different output from yours
[19:53:15] <Eviltwin> (i.e. no exception)
[19:54:14] <Eviltwin> raj: Did you see this? http://jsfiddle.net/aSfEB/
[19:55:29] <raj> no, that's beautiful
[19:55:50] <Eviltwin> So the timer encapsulates the logic
[19:56:01] <Eviltwin> And exposes methods for start/stop/reset
[19:56:08] <Eviltwin> As well as getting and setting the current time
[19:56:23] <Eviltwin> (which needs to behave differently depending on whether it's running or not)
[19:56:37] <Eviltwin> But you don't need to worry if it's running or not from the outside
[19:56:56] <devians> under what circumstances would .find() fail to return anything when theres clearly stuff there
[19:57:01] <raj> but it's no longer a jquery extension?
[19:57:03] <raj> why's that?
[19:57:23] <Whirl3d_> devians, typo?
[19:57:30] <Eviltwin> You could make it a jQuery UI $.widget
[19:57:35] <devians> nope. doesnt even work for .find('div')
[19:57:40] <Eviltwin> Or something that works like the jQuery UI $.widget
[19:57:57] <Eviltwin> But it's a little bit tricky to support multiple plugin methods cleanly
[19:58:07] <Whirl3d_> devians, jquery not loaded?
[19:58:14] <Eviltwin> As explaind here: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[19:58:16] <raj> what's redraw ?
[19:58:24] <devians> nope this is way way down in a big jquery page. its clearly there and working
[19:58:27] <Eviltwin> It's what actually updates the element
[19:58:31] <Eviltwin> To the new time
[19:58:34] <devians> .children gives me the div thats the immediate child
[19:58:35] <Whirl3d_> devians, perhaps you could make a fiddle so we could look at it
[19:58:37] <Eviltwin> It can be called whenever
[19:58:41] <raj> just used internally?
[19:58:46] <raj> or I'm supposed to call it
[19:58:47] <Eviltwin> Yeah, doesn't *need* to be public
[19:58:47] <Whirl3d_> ?cik
[19:58:48] <bot-t> Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[19:58:52] <raj> k
[19:59:05] <devians> Whirl3d_ cant unfortunately, its a huge mess and i cant justify the time to fiddlefy it
[19:59:05] <Eviltwin> But if you do something shady (like overwrite the contents of the element for some reason)
[19:59:09] <Eviltwin> You may want to manually call it
[19:59:23] <Eviltwin> Shouldn't need to if you keep it kosher though
[19:59:33] <mansuk> In a given Div I want to highlight a bunch of elements. http://jsfiddle.net/ZQNxP/ However, in the code above I am unable to restrict the event handler to only elements in the div. Can some one take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/ZQNxP/ and let me know what the parameter for on should be so that I can only restrict the firing of events to the elements in the div?
[19:59:45] <Whirl3d_> oh, but you had hoped that we would be able to magically decode your mess and find the error and tell you. LOL. (im just kidding)
[20:00:06] <devians> no need to be a dick about it. i was wondering if anyone had known edge cases
[20:00:16] <raj> cool, I'm playing with it Eviltwin to dissect it, thank you soooo much!
[20:00:19] <Whirl3d_> anyways, Eviltwin (and coldhead and shoky) are pretty much the only ones that are psychic round here. LOL
[20:00:28] <devians> ie $('form div') gives me divs, but $('form').find('div') doesnt
[20:00:48] <Whirl3d_> man, lighten up. I was joking around...hence the LOL and (just kidding)
[20:01:11] <Eviltwin> devians: That's not an edge case I'm aware of
[20:01:33] <devians> hrm. i wonder if this is my chrome being terrible agai
[20:03:46] <Eviltwin> devians: http://jsfiddle.net/83EVq/
[20:04:09] <Eviltwin> Seems to work fine there
[20:04:28] <Eviltwin> Is it literally the difference between $('form div') and $('form').find('div'); Or are there variables involved
[20:04:29] <Whirl3d_> Eviltwin, so in my fiddle, the goals is to make the object a "proxy" (not jquery.proxy) for it's target. So mirror.width(100) would set the target width to 100. But mirror.width()  would return the target's width
[20:04:49] <devians> Eviltwin literally
[20:05:43] <Whirl3d_> * a proxy for a subset of the target's properties...sorry
[20:05:57] <Ukto> so I got a weird json issue.. when I do $.getJSON(jsonURL, function(data) { $.someInfo = data }); alert($.someInfo["name"]);  onlick, i get that $.someInfo is undefined... if I set it to alert twice... the first one is undefined, the second has data ?
[20:06:15] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d_: http://jsfiddle.net/qjKD2/20/
[20:06:18] <Eviltwin> Is that not working?
[20:06:51] <Eviltwin> ?ajax101 @ Ukto

[20:18:41] <Whirl3d_> Why is it that I feel a great sense of sorrow that Eviltwin would be having to catch a bus. If I wrote the rules, he'd have a chauffuer waiting for him...jeesh the inequity of the world we live in...
[20:19:43] <hacks> var $element = $(element) or element if already a jQuery object.
[20:19:46] <hacks> How do I do that?
[20:20:09] <devians> nesting jquery objects accidentally is fine
[20:20:15] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d_: Well it is a private shuttle
[20:20:18] <devians> ie no check needed
[20:20:19] <Whirl3d_> var $elem=$elem.jquery?$elem:$(elem)
[20:20:29] <Whirl3d_> okay
[20:20:32] <Whirl3d_> pfew
[20:20:49] <Eviltwin> hacks: When in doubt, wrap it in $(...)
[20:22:42] <mansuk> In a given Div I want to highlight a bunch of elements. http://jsfiddle.net/ZQNxP/ However, in the code above I am unable to restrict the event handler to only elements in the div. Can some one take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/ZQNxP/ and let me know what the parameter for on should be so that I can only restrict the firing of events to the elements in the div?
[20:23:47] <hacks> Eviltwin: I guess that'll do.:)
[20:24:25] <Whirl3d_> mansuk $(somediv).on(....
[20:24:37] <Whirl3d_> not $(document).on
[20:24:42] <atula> mansuk: oh gosh, that scared me a bit. Are you trying to do a hover event?
[20:25:14] <mansuk> atula: yes on hover I want to add a border over an element, but only if the element is within a div
[20:25:50] <Whirl3d_> does hover bubble events?
[20:25:57] <atula> mansuk: I'm thinking $('somediv *').hover(function () { //on }, function () { //off });
[20:26:11] <atula> mansuk: it's TERRIBLE to use *...
[20:26:18] <atula> I think you should rethink your strategy
[20:26:20] <feelx> Hello! I am using JQuery Tabs and I can't find the way to load content in the current tab when clicking on a link from the content
[20:26:49] <mansuk> Whirl3d_: so it will be $('#demo p' +) to highlight all paragraphs in a div?
[20:27:12] <Whirl3d_> for the entire document?
[20:27:16] <mansuk> atula: what is a better strategy? I am new to JS, so still figuring it out...
[20:27:22] <Whirl3d_> or do you mean in just a container inside the doc
[20:27:45] <mansuk> Whirl3d_: just in one container in the document, I want to select elements and make events fire..
[20:27:46] <Whirl3d_> if you have all of your "highlightable" elements in a single div, use the .on Handler on that div
[20:28:04] <atula> it seems like you're trying to "add border" or make things look a certain way when mouse is hover over a div.
[20:28:08] <Whirl3d_> then anything outside fo that div will not react
[20:28:22] <Whirl3d_> best to do it with css
[20:28:25] <mansuk> atula: yes.. and after that on a double click I clone the element..
[20:28:32] <atula> mansuk:  the better strategy is you add a class on hover and remove the class when off. using this class, you could style it via css.
[20:28:49] <Whirl3d_> or just devine a :hover class
[20:29:10] <atula> div:hover isn't cross browser, but if you want to use a:hover, I'm all for it
[20:29:25] <atula> Whirl3d_:
[20:29:27] <Whirl3d_> good to know...thx
[20:29:27] <atula> ^
[20:29:59] <atula> I'm old school... rely on things you can rely on 100% unless you're doing a webkit browser only... then it's a different story
[20:30:37] <mansuk> atula: Whirl3d_  what os the difference between doing this in CSS vs JS? Also I am interested in event binding now than others...
[20:30:56] <rodd> man I need a vacation
[20:31:42] <atula> mansuk: the reason you want to keep "styling" stuff in css and the manipulation in javascript is so that 1) code maintainability 2) more efficient
[20:31:55] <atula> brb. diaper change.
[20:32:12] <Whirl3d_> he wears diapers and is old school. That is rough
[20:32:32] <Whirl3d_> I mean, I'm getting old but you kids are still in diapers?
[20:33:28] <lsterling> I am using a console.log function to apply an .active class to jump links on my site. But it doesn't work in IE. Anyone know another way to achieve this that will work in IE? http://jsfiddle.net/HwR4J/1/
[20:33:47] <Eviltwin> mansuk: Something like this should work: http://jsfiddle.net/ZQNxP/1/
[20:34:25] <Eviltwin> Can't test, on from phone
[20:34:38] <rodd> lsterling open developer tools on IE
[20:34:42] <rodd> because of console
[20:35:09] <mansuk> atula: oh ok thanks...
[20:35:13] <lsterling> but what about the average viewer?
[20:35:15] <rodd> or check whether console is valid
[20:35:47] <mansuk> Eviltwin: thanks... will try that...
[20:35:51] <rodd> lsterling what do you mean?
[20:36:00] <Whirl3d_> lsterling you use chrome to debug
[20:36:04] <lsterling> sorry i misunderstood.
[20:36:07] <Whirl3d_> that's what console is for
[20:36:09] <rodd> console is just for debugging
[20:38:25] <Whirl3d_> llsterling, wtf? We spent some time yesterday working on that and came to the realization that you don't want to add the active class to your anchor elements, but rather to their parent elements
[20:38:33] <Whirl3d_> or closest("li")
[20:38:52] <lsterling> I think I must have just not understood what we were doing. I thought that code was what I needed to use to make it work.
[20:39:16] <Whirl3d_> we had probably 10 other versions after that one
[20:39:34] <lsterling> It never started working until I put that code in my header.
[20:39:43] <lsterling> If I remove it stops working
[20:40:18] <lsterling> I'm sorry - I'm out of my depth here.
[20:40:38] <Whirl3d_> no you are doing fine.
[20:40:53] <Whirl3d_> you just grabbed an old version of it.
[20:42:56] <atula> Whirl3d_: heh, my little girl is 1 month today :)
[20:43:49] <Whirl3d_> coool. I didn't really think you were in diapers.
[20:44:10] <atula> mansuk: I understand that sometimes getting the answer to your specific question is much easier. I think Eviltwin have given you that. test it out. But as I was mentioning before, I hope you give it some thoughts.
[20:44:16] <Whirl3d_> lsterling, you are going to have to use the hashchange plugin from ben allman
[20:44:28] <atula> it's always a good thing to keep learning and if you have question, just ask again, mansuk
[20:44:56] <lsterling> Whirl3d_ ok thank you. I'll go do that now.
[20:45:01] <lsterling> I remember you mentioning that
[20:45:07] <lsterling> But it was all working, so I thought I was good
[20:45:12] <lsterling> but then I looked at IE
[20:50:29] <Whirl3d_> I have a function that takes a single parameter and that param can be a selector (string), number, function,  or jquery object. I want to end up with a jquery object....so if its a selector or selector function $(param) will work, but if its a number, I need this.contents.eq(num)...what's the best way to filter all that?
[20:52:14] <atula> Whirl3d_: that sounds like you're trying to be clever :) I would suggest sticking with a plain object and pass in whatever you need {'number': 1} or something else
[20:52:32] <atula> then you'd just check for the case...
[20:52:50] <atula> it's probably isn't as clear when you do something like this though.
[20:53:01] <Whirl3d_> it's a simple showSlide (param) function that I wan tto be able to pass an index number or a string like "next" or "prev" or an actual slide..
[20:53:30] <atula> so just a number or a string?
[20:53:48] <Whirl3d_> or a jquery object (slide)
[20:53:48] <atula> there are 4 things you mentioned above.
[20:54:08] <Whirl3d_> a selector function will resolve to a jquery object
[20:54:27] <atula> function, jquery object, number or string, right?
[20:54:40] <vadi2> I'm looking at http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors, but I'm not quite understanding how can I select something by a specific "name" attribute?
[20:54:50] <Whirl3d_> right, but function, jquery object and string can all be wrapped and will work $(param)
[20:55:12] <Whirl3d_> its just the special strings, wchi I can call out ornumbers
[20:55:20] <atula> try { $(param).length} catch (e) { check for number }
[20:55:23] <atula> Whirl3d_:
[20:55:25] <atula> ^
[20:55:55] <atula> if $(param) works you're all set.. if not, catch error and check for the number. if that fails screams!
[20:56:05] <Whirl3d_> that's the first time I've seen anyone use try/catch in jquery...cool.
[20:56:07] <atula> but that's what I would do if I was forced to do it
[20:56:20] <Whirl3d_> but $(garbage) doesn't throw an error
[20:56:28] <atula> Whirl3d_: jquery is just javascript :)
[20:56:37] <atula> that's why the .length comes in
[20:56:41] <Whirl3d_> it returns an empty set
[20:56:44] <atula> if selector doesn't exist you scream
[20:56:49] <Whirl3d_> length will be 0
[20:57:21] <atula> so it wouldn't throw an error.
[20:57:27] <atula> then force an error when there's 0
[20:57:28] <atula> :)
[20:57:30] <atula> problem solves
[20:57:57] <atula> if ($(param).length) { do stuff} else { throw error!} then you catch it in your catch (e)
[20:57:58] <Whirl3d_> ;)   riiiight..okay
[20:58:01] <atula> does that makes sense ?
[20:58:20] <Whirl3d_> atula, thanks. LOL
[20:58:59] <atula> I would try to not be too clever though. it'll come back to haunt you some time later.
[20:59:09] <atula> but good luck.
[20:59:24] <atula> alright, back to upgrading django version on my project
[21:02:22] <Juanlajara> hey guys, is there any way to declare a variable undefined inside an object literal? but without using myVar : undefined
[21:02:36] <Juanlajara> a way*
[21:02:52] <Whirl3d_> there needs to be some kind of reputation presentation on irc. A system that indicates the level of experience a user has in some way. It would make it possible to have an entirely different approach to someone based on their expereince level.
[21:03:38] <Whirl3d_> Juanlajara, could you use a value like null?
[21:04:09] <nafg___> Juanlajara: Option?
[21:04:13] <Juanlajara> hmmm
[21:04:27] <Juanlajara> ya that may work for me
[21:04:46] <Juanlajara> it was just about not letting any troll write undefined = true or something
[21:04:48] <Whirl3d_> Have you tried it with undefined?
[21:04:58] <Whirl3d_> lol
[21:05:01] <Juanlajara> you know
[21:05:13] <yogacore> anyone can recommended a great books for jquery ?
[21:05:25] <Whirl3d_> stemfault can...
[21:05:27] <Whirl3d_> lol
[21:05:30] <Juanlajara> jqfundamentals
[21:05:44] <danheberden> ?learn @ yogacore
[21:05:44] <bot-t> yogacore, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[21:05:56] <Juanlajara> http://jqfundamentals.com/
[21:09:00] <yogacore> danheberden: yes i'm learn about jquery
[21:09:59] <Eviltwin> I hope that helped mansuk
[21:18:33] <danheberden> yogacore: as long as you learn JavaScript first, you'll do just fine
[21:21:28] <yogacore> danheberden: ok i see. btw in your opinion, how long i can mastering it?
[21:25:18] <Eviltwin> Ah damn, wasn't quite there on his issue: http://jsfiddle.net/ZQNxP/2/
[21:25:21] <Eviltwin> But it works now
[21:34:35] <Eviltwin> yogacore: It's hard to say how long JavaScript and jQuery take to master. Some people pick it up in a few days or weeks, others take months or years
[21:35:32] <coldhead> as if anyone picks it up in days or weeks
[21:35:40] <coldhead> its my first day and i'm still struggling
[21:35:45] <coldhead> __prototype__ ?
[21:35:49] <coldhead> the fuck is that
[21:36:05] <yogacore> Eviltwin: ok thanks, it means depends on the people
[21:36:29] <Whirl3d_> is there a secret way to parse the properties of an object so that you can split up it's prefixed properties easily:  source: {initOpactiy:0, initDisplay:"block", initClass:"ready", initFunc:someFunc, func:anotherFunc, opacity:0, endOpacity:1, endClass:"current")   would parse into the object {init:{css:{opacity:0, display:"block"}, class:"ready", dest{css:{opacity:0, func:anotherfunc}, end:{css:{opacity:1},class:'current'}}   ---uggg
[21:39:46] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d_: With specifically init and end? prefixes?
[21:40:12] <Whirl3d_> in this case, yes.
[21:41:10] <Eviltwin> So initFontSize -> init:{fontSize: ...}?
[21:41:47] <Whirl3d_> yes
[21:42:15] <Whirl3d_> I'm trying to encapsulate the animation states for an element and store them in a library for quick reference.
[21:42:25] <Eviltwin> Why not store them in the end structure?
[21:42:40] <Whirl3d_> meaning in the elements themselves?
[21:42:54] <Eviltwin> Meaning in the structure you're asking to parse them into
[21:44:01] <Whirl3d_> there is a reason for that....but it escapes me right now. i'll head down that path now and I'm sure it will be obvious shortly...
[21:50:21] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d_: http://jsfiddle.net/JWPy2/
[21:51:08] <richardr> Using a unique element ID, how would I 'listen' for changes to a rel="" attribute?
[21:51:22] <Eviltwin> richardr: You can't listen for attribute changes
[21:51:48] <Eviltwin> But what you can do is everytime you change the rel, trigger a custom event as well
[21:52:03] <Eviltwin> Like: $("#foo").attr("rel", "foobar").trigger("rel-changed")
[21:52:17] <Eviltwin> And have a $("#foo").on("rel-changed", function() { ... });
[21:52:31] <richardr> Eviltwin: Thanks :)
[21:53:46] <nafg___> if you navigate back to a pushState'd url, is that url the one sent to the server?
[21:54:14] <Eviltwin> nafg___: It's a stack
[21:55:56] <nafg___> According to https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history ,
[21:56:04] <nafg___> Suppose now that the user now navigates to http://google.com, then clicks back. At this point, the URL bar will display http://mozilla.org/bar.html, and the page will get a popstate event whose state object contains a copy of stateObj. The page itself will look like foo.html, although the page might modify its contents during the popstate event.
[21:56:46] <nafg___> I'm trying to understand if "will look like foo" means that it will GET /foo.html and run the popstate event, or what?
[21:59:17] <nafg___> Basically I want that ?orderid=xxx should be interpretable *either* by the client --- that is, clicking an order will update the displayed order,
[21:59:30] <nafg___> s/either/both/
[21:59:52] <nafg___> *and* by the server, so when you navigate to /?orderid=xxx, the page comes loaded for that order.
[22:00:24] <nafg___> What is $.get and $.getScript?
[22:00:34] <Eviltwin> nafg___: Visit api.jquery.com
[22:00:54] <Cork> ?.get
[22:00:55] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[22:01:01] <Cork> ?jquery.get
[22:01:01] <bot-t> jQuery.get(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[22:01:07] <Cork> ?jquery.getScript
[22:01:07] <bot-t> jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[22:01:39] <nafg___> Anyone have an answer to my previous question about history?
[22:02:42] <Cork> nafg___: yes, when you go back from another domain it will do a full page reload
[22:03:03] <nafg___> Cork: Okay, what about from the same domain?
[22:03:07] <nafg___> Just a popstate?
[22:03:45] <Cork> that you can only use push and pop from the same domain
[22:03:58] <Cork> as soon as you cross domain, those things won't act
[22:04:29] <Cork> the page will load just like if you had typed the url in the address bar
[22:04:48] <nafg___> If I pushState to /?order=1 and then pushState to /?order=2 and then press Back, will it send a request to the server?
[22:05:07] <Cork> if its cache is out of date yes
[22:05:34] <nafg___> Okay, so I'm using Lift so the page is never cached.
[22:06:25] <nafg___> So that's good --- it means I never have to handle a popstate event.
[22:06:47] <coldhead> what a great result
[22:06:49] <nafg___> I only have to populate the displayed order on page load, and in response to the user choosing an order.
[22:06:51] <coldhead> take 5 everyone
[22:07:42] <Eviltwin> nafg___: http://jsfiddle.net/kXLBM/6/show/
[22:08:04] <nafg___> And when the user chooses an order interactively, it does a pushstate that only the server will care about.
[22:09:55] <nafg___> Eviltwin: odd, when i traverse back from /show to /show/foo I see a fetch but when I go back to /show/foo/bar there is no fetch.
[22:10:10] <nafg___> Then when I go back I get a 404
[22:10:28] <nafg___> So how did the fetch work before?
[22:10:40] <nafg___> Your jsfiddle is confusing
[22:10:58] <Eviltwin> How so?
[22:11:03] <Eviltwin> I don't see how it could be more straightforward
[22:11:51] <vadi2> Is:
[22:11:51] <vadi2> jQuery('select[name=class]').disabled = true
[22:11:51] <vadi2> valid? I'm inexperienced with both JS and jQuery.
[22:12:08] <nafg___> Eviltwin: The behaviror is confusing as I described.
[22:12:16] <nafg___> The code is very clear -- thanks!
[22:12:18] <Eviltwin> vadi2: Valid but won't do what you want it to do
[22:12:26] <vadi2> Yeah. What's the right thing?
[22:12:51] <Eviltwin> jQuery('select[name=class]').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
[22:13:44] <nafg___> Eviltwin, Cork: huh? Now it's not doing any page load. Maybe it was a Chrome bug
[22:13:52] <vadi2> Ah, .attr function
[22:14:02] <nafg___> Oh I see the problem
[22:14:27] <nafg___> I refreshed the page when it was at /foo
[22:14:37] <nafg___> So the pushState urls worked relative to that.
[22:15:45] <Damiano> hello everybody
[22:16:00] <nafg___> So it doesn't load new pages, but that's because it's cached. Eviltwin, is there any way to get jsfiddle to prevent caching?
[22:16:23] <Eviltwin> What?
[22:16:37] <Eviltwin> "it doesn't load new pages"?
[22:17:18] <Damiano> i have this code: https://gist.github.com/2963998 with IE 9 (document mode: not standard) i get and error at line 6 "SCRIPT1028: Previsto identificatore, stringa o numero" (In english should be: Expected identifier, string or number)  what should it be?
[22:17:32] <vadi2> Is it jQuery('select[name=class]').attr('disabled', 'enabled'); to enable?
[22:18:05] <Cork> ?.prop @ vadi2
[22:18:05] <bot-t> vadi2, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[22:18:17] <Cork> jQuery('select[name=class]').attr('disabled', true)
[22:18:21] <Cork> and jQuery('select[name=class]').attr('disabled', false)
[22:18:25] <Cork> bah
[22:18:31] <Cork> i meant jQuery('select[name=class]').prop('disabled', false)
[22:20:41] <vadi2> Thanks :)
[22:22:19] <coldhead> HOPE FOR WARM BODIES
[22:23:25] <Cork> coldhead: your out with your ak 44 again?
[22:24:43] <ENQ> hey guys, is it posible to include my plugin to fiddle.jshell.net?
[22:25:03] <Cork> sure
[22:25:12] <Cork> just add it in the external resources
[22:25:45] <ENQ> the Add Resource part i gues, but it doesnt work, maybe becouse i use git as source?
[22:25:48] <ENQ> github
[22:26:04] <Cork> it needs to be application/javascript or text/javascript yes
[22:26:14] <Cork> else the browser won't run it
[22:26:36] <ENQ> its js, i use raw thing in github
[22:26:41] <Cork> uh...
[22:26:43] <Cork> mimetype
[22:26:46] <ENQ> ohh
[22:27:05] <ENQ> then i need another place where to put it :)
[22:27:45] <Cork> http://developer.github.com/v3/mime/
[22:28:41] <ENQ> thanks
[22:29:09] <Damiano> someone coul dhelp me?
[22:29:24] <Damiano> i have this code: https://gist.github.com/2963998 with IE 9 (document mode: not standard) i get and error at line 6 "SCRIPT1028: Previsto identificatore, stringa o numero" (In english should be: Expected identifier, string or number)
[22:29:40] <fedya> I can't seem to figure this out: http://pastebin.com/BJBq4jCC I need to return the true/false result from the verify.process to the containing function, because it needs to return true or false for the validator to work
[22:29:51] <Eviltwin> Damiano: Please reproduce your issue in a jsFiddle: jsfiddle.net
[22:30:42] <Damiano> Eviltwin, it is a function....can ricerca() inside $(function(){ ... });
[22:30:44] <Cork> fedya: you can't refer to this in the process callbacks
[22:30:56] <Damiano> and ricerca() is in there
[22:31:03] <Cork> this will be local to the function
[22:31:16] <Eviltwin> Damiano: Put the code in jsFiddle
[22:31:17] <Eviltwin> Run it
[22:31:22] <Cork> fedya: it is in its scope though, so no need for it
[22:31:28] <Cork> fedya: just user result
[22:31:28] <Eviltwin> Make sure it actually has the error you said it had
[22:31:33] <fedya> i can make the 'onSuccess' function actually display the error message, but i'd like to just return true or false in the callback function for addMethod()
[22:31:35] <Eviltwin> Then save it and share it with us
[22:31:51] <fedya> ah i didn't mean to leave this in there, was just experimenting
[22:31:56] <Cork> fedya: is that ajax based?
[22:32:01] <fedya> yes
[22:32:05] <Cork> then you can't return
[22:32:10] <Cork> ajax is async
[22:32:23] <Cork> your main function will have ended before those functions are called
[22:32:34] <fedya> oh?
[22:32:50] <fedya> hm, so how can i do it then?
[22:32:56] <Cork> callbacks
[22:33:00] <fedya> have the on success actually show error?
[22:33:14] <fedya> ohhh i think there's a method from validator for showErrors() maybe it's for this reason, checking
[22:36:23] <fedya> http://pastebin.com/Yvwy4kQM
[22:37:11] <fedya> it seems that i can use showErrors() of the validator class to display the message after the ajax call is successful, but validator nor $.validator seem to be in the scope...
[22:37:20] <mbrochh> Hey all... I'm trying to use the jquery.ui datepicker and I want to restrict min date and max date. Allowed dates should be between 10 and 90 years ago (it's for a date of birth field)
[22:37:38] <mbrochh> So i set min_date to "-90Y" and max_date to "-10Y"
[22:37:46] <Cork> fedya: what?
[22:38:07] <mbrochh> What i get is a selection of the years 1992 to 2002 ?!?
[22:38:22] <Cork> fedya: you mean $ is undefined?
[22:38:29] <fedya> no validator
[22:39:05] <Cork> that doesn't make sense
[22:39:43] <fedya> validator.showErrors({email: "test"}); -> Uncaught ReferenceError: validator is not defined
[22:40:06] <Cork> and console.log($.validator) ?
[22:41:51] <fedya> from console.log($.validator): function (a,
[22:41:52] <fedya> b){this.settings=c.extend(true,{},c.validator.defaults,a);this.currentForm=b;this.init()}
[22:42:10] <mbrochh> (got it. yearRange is the option I need)
[22:42:23] <Cork> fedya: and console.log($.validator.showErrors)
[22:42:56] <fedya> undefined...
[22:43:09] <Cork> so showErrors doesn't exist
[22:43:30] <fedya> i'm gonna try it at the top after document ready
[22:44:01] <fedya> odd, still undefined there
[22:44:14] <Cork> would have been odder if it existed
[22:44:17] <fedya> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Validator/showErrors
[22:44:49] <Cork> thats $(selector).validate().showErrors()
[22:45:04] <Cork> not $.validate.showErrors
[22:46:29] <fedya> yea…. i think i get it...
[22:46:57] <fedya> OH wait, i can do that within my function if i use the selector… checking
[22:47:46] <fedya> Aha, that works somewhat
[22:53:27] <fedya> Cork: thanks so much for your help: http://pastebin.com/mUsHfKdx
[22:59:01] <maletor> How can I have my javascript fire before my images load?
[22:59:19] <Cork> ?.ready @ maletor
[22:59:20] <bot-t> maletor, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[22:59:27] <macmartine> have your javascript load your images
[22:59:39] <Cork> uh... no
[22:59:46] <coldhead> bam
[22:59:47] <Cork> thats a terrible idea
[22:59:59] <maletor> Cork: I'm using $(document).ready ->
[23:00:15] <Cork> maletor: dom ready is triggered before images is fully loaded
[23:00:21] <Cork> except for ie
[23:00:27] <Cork> you don't really have a choice there
[23:01:13] <Eviltwin> Just add the scripts at the end of the body?
[23:01:26] <Cork> true
[23:01:28] <coldhead> move the images to a slower server
[23:01:28] <maletor> And my waterfall shows that it's loading images from my browser cache THEN firing domcontentloaded
[23:01:45] <maletor> I have one html attribute and my scripts are all at the end of the body with a async tag
[23:02:16] <Cork> maletor: what is it your trying to do?
[23:02:25] <Eviltwin> Did I say anything about an async tag??????
[23:02:45] <maletor> No need to get angry.
[23:02:47] <Cork> Eviltwin: if you put the script tag in the body it will be async
[23:03:14] <maletor> Cork: are you sure? I was pretty sure it blocked.
[23:03:27] <Cork> nope
[23:03:38] <Cork> uh... yes i'm sure it doesn't block
[23:03:59] <maletor> anyways what i'm trying to do is have one line of html with data attributes then load my javascript application as quickly as fucking possible
[23:04:01] <maletor> images be damend
[23:04:40] <Cork> if the script tag is at the end of the body it will be run as soon as the parser gets to that part of the html content
[23:04:56] <Eviltwin> (and after it's downloaded)
[23:05:40] <Cork> hard to run the script before its downloaded ;P
[23:05:41] <Eviltwin> I'd recommend inlining a very small script that handles how the page looks before the scripts download
[23:05:56] <Cork> ya
[23:06:31] <maletor> so just put the <script src=asdf> at the end of my body that should be all that is needed
[23:06:33] <Cork> or preferably not relay on js for page layout
[23:06:55] <maletor> i'm pretty sure a lot of people rely on js for layout
[23:07:01] <maletor> like hmmm, facebook, google
[23:07:09] <Cork> maletor: a lot of ppl do stupid things
[23:07:16] <Cork> google only does it for its web apps
[23:07:23] <Eviltwin> maletor: Disable JavaScript
[23:07:26] <maletor> how do you know i'm not building a web app
[23:07:32] <Eviltwin> Load Facebook
[23:07:34] <maletor> and that's false
[23:07:36] <Damiano> guys can i bind two events in the same line?
[23:07:40] <Damiano> jQuery("#anno").keyup(function(){ .. }
[23:07:43] <Eviltwin> Look at layout
[23:07:47] <Damiano> here i wolud also like to bind change event
[23:07:49] <maletor> go to google.com and inspect the html
[23:07:52] <Damiano> and does the same things
[23:07:54] <Damiano> is it possible?
[23:08:15] <Eviltwin> ?g jquery chaining @ Damiano
[23:08:16] <bot-t> Damiano, Quick Guide: Chaining in jQuery / Tobias Bjerrome Ahlin - http://tobiasahlin.com/blog/quick-guide-chaining-in-jquery/
[23:08:24] <maletor> facebook and google have noscripts that render basic layouts
[23:08:31] <Damiano> ok
[23:08:35] <maletor> and *try* and maintain functionality
[23:08:42] <Eviltwin> maletor: Uh...
[23:08:52] <Eviltwin> I can guarantee you this isn't the "basic" layout
[23:09:00] <Eviltwin> The site appears almost identical
[23:11:56] <ndimatteo> all, if I'm using slidesjs.com and fancy box in coordination with infinite-scroll.js. When I ajax request new content that has a slider within a fancy box modal, how do I recall those functions?
[23:12:31] <ndimatteo> when I have a callback function to reinitialize the slider/fancybox it messes up the ones that were initially loaded
[23:13:04] <maletor> There is nothing wrong with using javascript to do your layout.
[23:13:45] <Eviltwin> maletor: It just breaks if the browser doesn't support JavaScript or has it turned off
[23:14:53] <maletor> supporting people with javascript turned off i ridiculous
[23:16:16] <Eviltwin> Right, just both of the examples you pointed show an identical UI with and without JavaScript
[23:16:33] <maletor> you're right
[23:16:40] <maletor> but they have a lot more money than me
[23:16:56] <maletor> and i'm allowed to say fuck you to 0.05% of my users w/o js
[23:17:00] <maletor> don't you think
[23:17:14] <Eviltwin> Depends on if you want your app to be visually present quickly or not
[23:17:31] <Eviltwin> Avoid FOUC or just a giant spinner while things load
[23:18:15] <coldhead> people without JS don't deserve the internet
[23:18:21] <coldhead> they're trouble makers
[23:18:28] <Eviltwin> Says the guy using IRC
[23:18:38] <Cork> maletor: not really, the number of ppl that runs with selective js today is increasing quite a bit
[23:19:12] <Cork> and its normally easy enough to have a working site without js, and then use js to enhance it
[23:19:35] <Cork> i'm not saying it should be fancy, just that the content should be accessable
[23:22:43] <maletor> Meh, I'm just gonna disagree.
[23:23:24] <maletor> I have to disagree with Joel Spolsky's law about distributed systems.
[23:23:27] <mindis|wurk> i hate sites that rely heavily on javascript. it's just about as bad as flash sites
[23:23:59] <maletor> I can build my app to return nothing but JSON and then others can integrate and build HTML or JS implementations on top of that
[23:24:34] <coldhead> no one is ever going to visit our sites anyway, however we implement them
[23:24:39] <coldhead> its all about facebook now
[23:24:47] <Eviltwin> He he he he
[23:24:47] <Cork> lol
[23:24:51] <maletor> Rendering HTML from a web server takes way too much time, so you gotta use memcache. Then if you're gonna use memcache, you might as well just put straight JSON in there.
[23:25:09] <Cork> uh...
[23:25:09] <Eviltwin> coldhead: So I guess someone might visit my site
[23:25:19] <Cork> rendering html takes too much time??
[23:25:24] <Cork> wtf
[23:25:26] <mindis|wurk> i didn't get that either
[23:25:27] <maletor> it takes a fuck load of time
[23:25:32] <maletor> when you can't page cache
[23:26:06] <coldhead> json encoded html
[23:26:22] <Eviltwin> maletor: That's quite the chain of non sequiturs
[23:26:31] <coldhead> {"html": "<lol>aids</lol>"}
[23:27:17] <maletor> <div data-i-love-aids>
[23:29:18] <Eviltwin> Jesus dude
[23:29:21] <Eviltwin> </div>
[23:29:23] <Eviltwin> Close your tags
[23:29:53] <maletor> you just gave aids to jesus
[23:30:10] <Cork> lol
[23:30:26] <Eviltwin> Well you just made me cry for the future of web development
[23:30:34] <Eviltwin> So... about even
[23:30:46] <Cork> heh kinda agree ya
[23:30:59] <maletor> so you still think websites should use unobtrusive javascript?
[23:31:06] <maletor> that's so 2011
[23:31:06] <Cork> the world has way to many lazy web developers
[23:31:11] <Cork> yes
[23:31:34] <Cork> at least for sites that doesn't have a mandatory login
[23:31:49] <Cork> i'm prepared to accept js only behind a login screen
[23:31:51] <maletor> most sites worth their weight do
[23:32:09] <maletor> when i say web app i usually mean it has auth
[23:32:25] <Eviltwin> Because that's part of the definition of web app?
[23:32:30] <Cork> :D
[23:32:58] <Cork> but ya, i still think websites should work without js
[23:33:26] <Cork> its just building it in a special way, it doesn't really take much extra time if you do it right
[23:33:57] <Cork> there might be special features you want to exclude from that part, and add that ontop
[23:34:34] <Cork> like ex. social buttons, is a perfect example of what i find totally ok to not work without js
[23:35:02] <Cork> but not being able to read the content of the page without is is.... failure of design
[23:37:07] <coldhead> not being able to post to facebook is the only real problem
[23:39:35] <diverdude> Hello. I have a problem i really don't know how to fix. I have this setup: http://jsfiddle.net/rvWFK/14/   The problem is the following: If i press the X button in the corner of the image once and press yes in the modal, the event handler is called once, GREAT. But, if i close the modal and press the X again and press yes then the event handler is called twice. WHY? Each time i open the modalbox by pressing X, and click yes, the button click eve
[23:39:35] <diverdude> nt is invoked one more time. Why is this happening?
[23:41:11] <Eviltwin> diverdude: We'd greatly appreciate it if you could provide slim examples that isolate the heart of your problem
[23:41:13] <maletor> for me, where i am now, developing for only js is the way to go. makes boss man happy. makes the clients happy.
[23:41:30] <diverdude> Eviltwin: i have
[23:41:38] <maletor> if we ever get to the point where developing for non js becomes a priority then we can scale for that
[23:41:39] <diverdude> Eviltwin: i dont know how to boil it down further
[23:41:45] <maletor> but it's really not worth it
[23:41:46] <Cork> diverdude: where does modal come from?
[23:41:50] <Eviltwin> diverdude: There's still *a lot* here considering the problem you described
[23:41:53] <maletor> and it may never become worth it
[23:42:04] <diverdude> Cork: thats bootstrap twitter modal box
[23:42:08] <maletor> googlebot parses js, it's only a matter of time before the lines between htmla nd js are blurred
[23:42:10] <Cork> ah
[23:42:25] <diverdude> Eviltwin: yes, but if i knew  how to boil it further down, believe me i would have
[23:42:33] <Eviltwin> maletor: So you'll just take the five minutes it takes to make this render with unobtrusive JS then instead of now?
[23:42:38] <diverdude> Eviltwin: i made the simplest example i could think of
[23:42:43] <Eviltwin> 'Cause it'll be so easy once you have a lot more code?
[23:43:05] <diverdude> Eviltwin: which reproduces my problem
[23:43:30] <maletor> basically my i am serving an iphone, a js app, and 3rd parties all using my JSON api.
[23:43:45] <maletor> if somebody comes along and says, hey fucker, support me i only speak html
[23:43:49] <maletor> then we'll support that fucker
[23:44:04] <maletor> but today, iphone, js and any 3rd party can integrate just happily
[23:44:13] <diverdude> Cork: can you see the problem?
[23:44:28] <Cork> diverdude: no the code is broken so the buttons doesn't work
[23:44:32] <Cork> but i see why it fails
[23:44:41] <Cork> either remove the elements you bind or remove the events
[23:44:51] <Eviltwin> diverdude: So Result = { id: 1 } is critical to this issue?
[23:44:56] <Cork> or just bind them once when you create the dialog, and just let the events be
[23:45:41] <diverdude> Eviltwin: ok that line no...i wanted to make sure the eventhandler had access to that variable
[23:45:51] <Cork> diverdude: your binding click on the buttons each time the dialog is shown, so you will get an extra listener each click
[23:46:08] <Eviltwin> diverdude: What you should do is remove sections of code until removing one of them breaks it
[23:46:12] <Eviltwin> Then put that piece in and continue
[23:46:25] <Eviltwin> (If you have no better strategy)
[23:50:40] <Eviltwin> diverdude: Can you see the issue here? http://jsfiddle.net/6TxWr/
[23:51:15] <diverdude> Cork: you are definitly right. Thank you...You have lead me in the right direction
[23:51:55] <diverdude> Eviltwin: yeah ok...thats the same problem
[23:52:08] <diverdude> Eviltwin: because eventhandlers is bound twice as cork said
[23:52:14] <diverdude> Eviltwin: i did not know that
