[00:06:50] <neredsenvy> Well I have $('.glyph-toggle').on('click', function(){
[00:06:50] <neredsenvy> 		$(this).parent().parent().addClass('open');
[00:06:50] <neredsenvy> 	}); now
[00:07:36] <neredsenvy> But problem is when user clicks anywhere outside the displayed dropdown it does not hide the dropdown
[00:08:24] <arc_> well yes, you haven't told it to do that
[01:05:21] <Vivekananda> hi everyone
[01:16:29] <C0nundrum> Anyone used slick.js before ?
[01:36:00] <d3m0n> Anyone know what that image loading/transitioning plugin called? http://demo.kaliumtheme.com/main/masonry-v2/
[02:03:35] <prolink> is anyone on?
[02:16:18] <Pazician> prolink: Iam, good morning
[02:19:19] <C0nundrum> anyone mind helping me with slick
[02:20:00] <Pazician> C0nundrum: The slider thing, what's your problem?
[02:27:07] <C0nundrum> so fustrating
[02:27:19] <C0nundrum> everytime i try to slide the width of each element multiplies itself
[02:29:08] <Pazician> C0nundrum: Make a jsfiddle
[02:35:23] <C0nundrum> not sure how to recreate it. it happens within a certain div
[02:35:57] <C0nundrum> on initilization it calculates its width to some stupid unmaintiable size also
[02:37:24] <Pazician> Have you check these options? https://github.com/garand/sticky#options
[02:37:25] <C0nundrum> and completes ignores how much slides i tell it to show :/
[02:38:12] <C0nundrum> using this
[02:38:22] <C0nundrum> maybe if i knew how it sets it width intially
[02:40:02] <C0nundrum> but it makes no sense still. it should be resetting the css properties it relys on x.x
[02:45:17] <_lazarevsky> hello all
[02:45:21] <_lazarevsky> I just migrated to bootstrap 4
[02:45:33] <_lazarevsky> btn-xs no longer seems to be an option
[02:45:39] <_lazarevsky> has anyone migrated to bootstrap 4 yet?
[02:47:00] <C0nundrum> wow
[02:47:17] <C0nundrum> Pazician i think i found out what might be messing it up but i don't know how to fix it are u still htere ?
[02:47:35] <Pazician> C0nundrum: Yep, I'm here
[02:48:17] <C0nundrum> So i'm using this and i have it inside a li  and the probem seams to happen when the li has display: table
[02:48:24] <C0nundrum> i will try to make a fiddle
[02:48:43] <Pazician> What's your settings?
[02:49:38] <C0nundrum> <slick dots="true" infinite="false" speed="300" touch-move="true" slides-to-show="2" slides-to-scroll="4" focusOnSelect="true" swipeToSlide="true">
[02:50:12] <Pazician> Does it get any inline styles?
[02:51:13] <C0nundrum> http://i.imgur.com/ElJjenW.png
[02:51:28] <C0nundrum> http://i.imgur.com/Q6GbATR.png
[02:52:24] <Pazician> What your properties for the li?
[02:52:33] <Pazician> What's*
[02:52:48] <C0nundrum> http://i.imgur.com/pe4HeSC.png
[02:53:19] <Pazician> Why are you using display: table?
[02:53:23] <C0nundrum> if i remove display table, it starts calculating properly
[02:53:37] <C0nundrum> for vertical aligning childrens
[02:53:41] <Pazician> From the sticky plugin?
[02:54:04] <C0nundrum> this it the plugin https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiA5NmUjKvJAhWK8CYKHb4IAMAQFggyMAI&url=http%3A%2F%2Fkenwheeler.github.io%2Fslick%2F&usg=AFQjCNGx_jdVLP__MakcyBIdSRV4kKFe2Q&sig2=xYkguih34ZOysufiHh5iAQ
[02:54:04] <b-ot> (C0nundrum) http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/
[02:54:32] <C0nundrum> not sure why it doesn't like tables :/
[02:55:39] <Pazician> I don't get it, shouldn't you use the options in a js file, and not in the HTML itself?
[02:56:23] <Pazician> C0nundrum: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25775152/fixed-width-slides-with-slick-carousel
[02:56:45] <Pazician> Try: variableWidth: true
[02:58:56] <C0nundrum> still happens
[03:00:03] <Pazician> Use variableWidth: true and then target the element, should work
[03:00:21] <Pazician> Target with CSS properties
[03:00:47] <Pazician> Like this .slick-slide {width: 200px}
[03:07:33] <C0nundrum> god i hate this module
[03:07:45] <C0nundrum> i removed all my css and just made my container display inline block
[03:07:50] <C0nundrum> and it still freaking does it
[03:08:57] <C0nundrum> do you know any alternative modules ?
[03:18:23] <Pazician> You want a slider right?
[03:18:43] <Pazician> https://plugins.jquery.com/tag/slider/
[03:22:42] <C0nundrum> well a carosel that supports multiple items and setting how much items to scroll at a time
[03:23:05] <C0nundrum> i can't belief how fragile this stupid libary is anything releated to display inlineblack or display table and the whole thing breaks
[03:27:34] <wili> Hey anyone have a tip for lib for create popup during leaving page with edited form? I triend Are You Sure, but it doesnt working with input out of main form tag (connected via form="form-id")
[03:33:52] <P3nnyw1se> hi guys, complete javascript noob here, trying to solve something with css and was told js was the answer ...   : "if String =! null -> 'show this boxt with the text inside'   if String == null -> 'hide the box'
[03:34:36] <Cork> P3nnyw1se: a little less psudo code
[03:34:40] <Cork> P3nnyw1se: what is "String"
[03:34:46] <P3nnyw1se> var
[03:34:56] <Cork> heh, ya but what is it
[03:35:07] <P3nnyw1se> 30 letters ;) its a name
[03:35:14] <Cork> are you trying to do something based on the dom, json what?
[03:35:21] <P3nnyw1se> if the server provides it, I want to show it.. if the server doesn't provide it,. I don't want to show it
[03:35:27] <P3nnyw1se> its data from EF
[03:35:34] <Cork> EF?
[03:35:37] <P3nnyw1se> entity framework
[03:35:40] <Cork> ah
[03:35:48] <Cork> so this is inside an ajax callback?
[03:36:28] <Kartagis> can I prevent scroll only to top?
[03:36:31] <P3nnyw1se> right now, its not inside anything...  when the page loads.  it gets a lot of data and display it. now depending on when it loads. it either has some data for this 'var' or it doesn't.. if it does I want it to display a box with the var inside.. if it doesn't I want to hide the box as if it never existed
[03:37:05] <Cork> P3nnyw1se: $('#the-box').toggle(variable == null)
[03:37:16] <Cork> that might not work, hard to tell with so little info
[03:38:09] <Cork> Kartagis: you mean don't allow the user to scroll the page if the scroll is at the top of the page?
[03:38:23] <P3nnyw1se> its really a simply solution .. page load -> gets data from entity framework  -> if data is there var is filled, if data isn't, var remains null ... now I want the page to check if the var is null or not to determine if it should be displayed
[03:38:27] <P3nnyw1se> I will try with what you wrote
[03:38:29] <Cork> that sounds like a horrible idea...
[03:39:01] <Cork> P3nnyw1se: if it doesn't make a jsfiddle with the code your working with
[03:39:07] <Kartagis> Cork: no no, don't allow the user to scroll to top if scroll is in the middle of the page (offset unknown)
[03:39:21] <Cork> O_o wat...
[03:40:15] <Cork> Kartagis: why on earth would you want to do something like that?
[03:41:09] <Kartagis> Cork: I'm doing this ajax call and displaying results in another div, way below the page. I don't want users to be able to scroll to top and see the ajax criterias
[03:41:35] <Cork> Kartagis: if you don't want them to be able to see it, why show them?
[03:41:57] <Cork> Kartagis: messing with the scrollbar is normally a bad idea
[03:42:03] <Cork> and isn't even possible on mobile
[03:42:16] <Cork> (well you can scroll, but not prevent scrolling)
[03:42:35] <Cork> and that will soon be true for desktop too
[03:43:29] <Kartagis> Cork: hrm, then let me ask you this. is it possible to show ajax get results on another page?
[03:43:52] <Cork> uh
[03:44:13] <Cork> Kartagis: you could have them in a collapsed element and provide a toggle
[03:49:15] <Pazician> What am I doing wrong here? https://jsfiddle.net/gzw1zs6r/13/ - What I want to do is, I want to move the dialog data to a div called .gen-info-box and just display one string in the marker dialog, like city.url2 or similar in the marker dialog
[03:52:13] <Pazician> console.log($content.html()) - this gets undefined for some reasons
[03:54:02] <Cork> Pazician: cause  $('.gm-style-iw').find($divOnPage) == undefined
[03:54:08] <Cork> your target isn't found
[03:54:50] <Pazician> Cork: Right, so how should I target to retrieve right data for the specific item?
[03:55:41] <Cork> Pazician: there isn't enough info in the fiddle to tell what you're trying to do
[03:55:55] <Cork> there are no gm-style-iw elements
[03:57:29] <Pazician> Cork: Alright, sorry for a image but this is rendering from Google, since I'm using the Google API for all this: http://puu.sh/ly1ZQ/11fb2cd150.png
[03:58:22] <Cork> Pazician: so uh why aren't you juse using $(this) ?
[03:58:59] <Pazician> What do you mean, I'm not following right now
[03:59:11] <Cork> you want the clicked element right?
[04:00:17] <Pazician> Right, when the clicked element is clicked, then it should move the dialog data to the div instead, and place just one of the for eg city.adress2 to the dialog
[04:00:43] <Pazician> But there will be city.url2 instead of city.adress...
[04:03:42] <wili> Anyone have some tip for js/canvas mind map(graph) lib? (retina display support is good)
[04:03:49] <C0nundrum> :'( finally got it working Pazician
[04:04:10] <Pazician> C0nundrum: Well done! How did you manage it?
[04:05:20] <Pazician> Cork: Do you've any ideas how to go further to get the right data from the dialog?
[04:05:34] <Cork> Pazician: as i don't have what your trying to do, no
[04:05:47] <C0nundrum> damn thing is a pain in the ass since it minpulates properties with javascript instead of just using css. Its container and itself have to be a display:block or display:flex otherwise it goes crazy just modified code to prevent it from being otherwise
[04:06:01] <Pazician> Are you not understanding?
[04:06:29] <Pazician> C0nundrum: Cool, I hope you learned something?
[04:06:45] <Cork> Pazician: i somewhat understand what your trying to do, but i can't help as i can't get the info to look at the problem
[04:07:01] <P3nnyw1se> I read that whole thing as a physical pain in your ass because the container had a 'block'
[04:07:07] <Cork> the most i can help is "good luck"
[04:08:01] <Cork> C0nundrum: it most likely checks the width/height of the elements
[04:08:10] <Cork> C0nundrum: and those values become 0 if a parent is display: none
[04:08:27] <Cork> (as the browser collapses the tree to save processing time)
[04:08:51] <Pazician> Cork: I understand, but from the logic how could it be done?
[04:09:09] <Cork> like i said, i don't have enough info to answer that
[04:09:33] <Pazician> Well, what do you need then? Do you want me to make a join.me conversation?
[04:09:36] <Cork> what i have is: "you have a dialog that shows something, and you want to select something else when something is clicked"
[04:10:41] <Cork> too much something and too little actual data
[04:11:51] <Pazician> "when the marker, or one of the flags (divs called .swe, .no, etc...) is clicked then the dialog normally will show up with data which is loaded form a JSON file. Now that data that's in the dialog is clicked I want to Move all the way to another div, so basically I want move the data that's in the dialog and move it to a div, but in the same time I want to append another data to the dialog, so two places should be f

[04:26:47] <maslo> hi guys, made a live chat annd I'd love for it to be scrollable with mouse wheel but not to have any scrollbars shown?, I hid the content via overflow-y: hidden and thought that would be enough...any ideas?
[04:30:12] <imox> hello how can I remove a css property?
[04:31:18] <maslo> $('element').css('property', '');
[04:37:00] <Pazician> Cork: Alright, I almost got it... https://jsfiddle.net/gzw1zs6r/14/
[04:37:29] <Pazician> I just don't know how to get the $content right
[04:41:43] <Pazician> Any ideas anyone?
[04:43:27] <Pazician> Updated: https://jsfiddle.net/gzw1zs6r/15/ - Now is the problem, it doesn't show the data in the .gen-info-box
[04:43:50] <Pazician> No idea why
[04:47:40] <Pazician> Yeah, I got it
[04:48:12] <Pazician> https://jsfiddle.net/gzw1zs6r/16/
[04:50:26] <Pazician> Can I use .is() to see if the element has the style of cursor: pointer? I need to target the "x" to remove the data in the infobox
[04:53:25] <arc_> is takes a selector. if you have a class that has cursor: pointer, and you can target that class, then you can use is
[04:53:35] <arc_> otherwise, you can use css()
[04:54:30] <Pazician> The thing is it's rendered from the Google API and I can't really access it - so I thought I could maybe target it by the style properties?
[04:54:50] <arc_> well, css() will return the value of a css property
[04:59:17] <Pazician> Alright, I'll try it out - thank you, arc_
[05:00:46] <Pazician> arc_: Like this? $('.gm-style-iw div').css('cursor': 'pointer').on('click', fun
[05:04:12] <arc_> you have a colon instead of a comma
[05:04:41] <Cork> no you can't select an element with .css
[05:05:00] <Cork> .css('cursor', 'pointer') will set the cursor value, not check it
[05:05:13] <arc_> and yeah, that also
[05:05:32] <arc_> .css('cursor') will return the value of pointer, which you can use in a conditional
[05:05:42] <Cork> you would have to do something horrible like filter(function() { return $(this).css('cursor') == 'pointer'; });
[05:08:41] <arc_> i was thinking like $('selector').each( function () { if ($(this).css('cursor') == pointer) { $(this).on('click', function () { ... } } } )}; , but that might be utterly ridiculous and it is 5am so i'm pretty tired
[05:09:29] <arc_> and i'm sure that has syntax errors
[05:13:23] <maslo> is there any way to have a div set to overflow-y: hidden yet still scrollable through mousewheel? I want it to be scrollable but have no scrollbar shown...
[05:26:52] <likecolacola> is this the right channel to ask about jquery ui dialogs?

[05:28:18] <slax0r> if someone who knows the solution catches it, they will help you I'm sure

[05:45:03] <[PhizoR]> hi, can anyone help me with the following please
[05:45:47] <[PhizoR]> I have an ID tag  id="cat:15:sub:19" all that will ever change is the integers, how can I get the 15 and 19 into seperate variables in jquery
[05:49:58] <robhol> Splitting it seems like the easiest option. regex is also an option
[05:50:39] <[PhizoR]> str.search & str.slice maybe
[05:50:55] <[PhizoR]> found a jquery string functions page,
[05:50:59] <robhol> wouldn't recommend it
[05:51:36] <[PhizoR]> robhol, how would splitting work
[05:51:59] <robhol> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split
[05:52:13] <[PhizoR]> well, I have a cat value and sub value, which I write into the id, so the ID construct can also change, does not have to be cat:85:sub:110
[05:52:15] <robhol> you get an array with each part
[05:52:37] <[PhizoR]> robhol awesome, will read up on it now
[05:52:44] <robhol> well first thing you need to do is find out what it CAN be
[05:52:52] <robhol> otherwise how are you going to find a way to parse it :p
[05:53:06] <[PhizoR]> what I decided is cat:VAL:sub:VAL
[05:53:17] <[PhizoR]> thought that would be easiest
[05:58:07] <fattest> is it possible to load a .json file that is in a non-accessible HTTP directory?
[06:01:15] <[PhizoR]> robhol, thnx - the .split will work, just going to remove the cat and sub just make it VAL:VAL
[06:02:01] <robhol> um
[06:02:11] <robhol> you can also just access the relevant parts
[06:02:23] <robhol> splitString[1] and [3] for example :p
[06:02:46] <robhol> cat and sub are 0 and 2 respectively

[06:47:25] <g33kyboi> I have had success with achieving file upload using this plugin but ny challenge is with resizing and croping image. The plugin fails to bring up the cropping dialog and instead fires the submit on the image and uploads right away. Maybe I'm missing something(s). But I have gone through the docs but nothing more I have not tried.

[07:44:39] <hellyeah> is it good idea to get highest height value of buttonClass and make the height of counterPart as height  http://jsfiddle.net/fjcqp33u/17/
[08:25:36] <Stummi> Hello. Looking for the correct approach for a problem. Lets say I have a div indicating a state with serval fixed classes (like ".indicator") and one class per possible state (state-ok, state-failed, etc.). So, now when the state changed, I want to set the state-class. My naive approach would be to remove all classes matching state-* and then add the correct class again, but I couldn't find a method to remove classes matching a pattern
[08:25:49] <hellyeah> taplar: are you there?
[08:26:23] <Cork> Stummi: you don't match partial classes
[08:26:23] <hellyeah> Stummi: is it possible to fiddle?
[08:26:52] <Stummi> hellyeah, I will try
[08:27:25] <Cork> Stummi: what you should do is .removeClass('state-ok state-failed ...').addClass('state-' + type)
[08:28:16] <Stummi> Cork, thought about that but this would mean that this piece of code would have to know about all possible states, which I did not consider clean code
[08:28:26] <Cork> Stummi: ya
[08:28:36] <Cork> surfdue: another option is to store the class in a .data attribute
[08:28:59] <Cork> <elm class="indicator state-ok" data-state="ok">
[08:29:17] <Cork> $(this).removeClass('state-' + $(this).data('state'))
[08:29:30] <Stummi> hm, thats a nice idea
[08:31:02] <Cork> surfdue: sorry wrong nick
[08:34:25] <Stummi> hellyeah, I think its mostly solved, but since I were about writing it anyway :) https://jsfiddle.net/cmr9z733/1/

Orange and Mango... I just want to know what do we call the [+2] template style in the UI world ?

[12:23:24] <robertmaxrees> because .value is for native DOM elements.

[12:28:32] <Torrone> I was thinking either to force the value on click or maybe I have to call some refresh function, but I can't find the value prop in the ckeditor object
[12:28:41] <robertmaxrees> errr, sounds like a question for ckeditor.
[12:29:00] <Torrone> robertmaxrees, is there really a channel for that?
[12:29:06] <robertmaxrees> never said there’s a channel ;)
[12:29:22] <robertmaxrees> but your question has nothing to do with jquery - you’ll probably have better luck elsewhere.
[12:29:25] <robertmaxrees> just a thought :)
[12:30:26] <Torrone> well if there was a ckeditor channel...
[12:30:41] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:30:45] <Torrone> but maybe some of you guys have worked with ckeditor before
[12:30:55] <Torrone> that's why I'm asking here
[12:31:02] <robertmaxrees> so just because there isn’t a channel for something means that the topic here changes?
[12:31:03] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:31:16] <robertmaxrees> just pointing you in a direction that’ll get you what you need faster.
[12:31:52] <Twirl> whats the correct way to stop a form from submitting when pressing enter or any other thing and prevent default? i binded the "submit" button to a click event but if the client presses enter it's the same
[12:32:18] <Torrone> robertmaxrees, I'm here because googling and other resources I have didn't help, sorry fot OT, I'll shut up about anything that isn't jQuery
[12:32:41] <robertmaxrees> Torrone i’m not saying to shut up about anything that isn’t jquery - just that you’ll likely have better luck elsewhere.
[12:32:42] <robertmaxrees> yeesh
[12:32:54] <robertmaxrees> Twirl sounds like the binding might be broken.  you sure it’s working?
[12:34:08] <Twirl> robertmaxrees: i have a <button type="button" class=btn" id="search_btn_widget">search</button> and a $('#search_btn_widget').click(func.. it works for the click event but im not sure about the correct way to prevent default for this form
[12:34:24] <robertmaxrees> Twirl oh, easy - bind to the submit event of the form.
[12:34:33] <robertmaxrees> $(‘form’).on(‘submit’, function(e) {});
[12:34:33] <Twirl> cool
[12:34:38] <Twirl> ty
[13:20:10] <z1haze> anyone use tooltipster here? I'm trying to change the content of a tooltip.. but its not working as expected.
[13:20:28] <z1haze> It causes me to mouseout then back over for it to take place
[13:20:56] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[13:41:25] <cheesedanish> I want scrollSpy like behaviour -- add a class to different parts of a table of contents as you scroll down the page.  What's a simple library / jquery plugin for that?
[13:41:54] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17760022/what-is-the-minimum-code-to-make-scrollspy-bootstrap-sidebar-like-the-example
[13:42:10] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you could use something like waypoints
[13:43:15] <z1haze> i think i figured it out while making the fiddle
[13:43:20] <robertmaxrees> z1haze awesome :)
[13:47:49] <cheesedanish> robertmaxrees: adding in bootstrap seems overkill for one feature... ah well good enough
[13:47:57] <robertmaxrees> cheesedanish oh, without bootstrap either?
[13:48:02] <robertmaxrees> that IS overkill.,
[13:48:06] <robertmaxrees> waypoints is standalone.
[13:48:14] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, do it manually.
[13:48:54] <ebol4> http://pastebin.com/xRA5icnt -- having an issue where, in the first block, `this` is not from the most recent .each(), it's from a previous one
[13:49:05] <ebol4> second block's `this` returns what is expected
[13:51:26] <robertmaxrees> can you provide a fiddle demonstrating how you know that?
[13:51:34] <ebol4> robertmaxrees: sure, one sec
[14:02:06] <ebol4> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/L8tt8gnd/
[14:03:15] <robertmaxrees> ebol4 you never call that function.
[14:03:25] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L8tt8gnd/1/
[14:03:28] <ebol4> robertmaxrees: oh my god
[14:03:31] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:03:51] <ebol4> robertmaxrees: i had meant for it to be like a lambda function, but i screwed up the syntax evidently
[14:04:07] <robertmaxrees> you mean an IIFE?>
[14:04:16] <robertmaxrees> oooor...?
[14:04:21] <ebol4> yes, iife
[14:04:25] <robertmaxrees> why?
[14:04:37] <robertmaxrees> you’re already in a function.
[14:05:18] <ebol4> that `maintContacts` variable is going to be an array, i need a function to fill the array, I think
[14:05:37] <robertmaxrees> you can just map over the values.
[14:06:12] <robertmaxrees> and then .get() against that to get your plain array.
[14:07:11] <robertmaxrees> also, avoi dselectors like td[id^=maintname]
[14:08:14] <ebol4> is there something wrong with that selector?
[14:08:22] <robertmaxrees> it functions, but it’s really inefficient.
[14:08:27] <robertmaxrees> you should use a class instead.
[14:08:58] <robertmaxrees> partial attribute selectors and prepending tagnames are both generally discouraged.
[14:09:48] <robertmaxrees> also, $('#sitetable').each(function() { doesn’t make any sense eiuther.
[14:10:24] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L8tt8gnd/2/ is closer to what you really want.
[14:15:00] <ebol4> robertmaxrees: that is significantly simpler... thanks a lot for your help!
[14:15:20] <robertmaxrees> yep.  the .each() on an id selector won’t do anything for you.
[14:15:28] <robertmaxrees> you can only ever an id once on a page.
[14:29:06] <skinux> I need some help getting jQuery.Sheet to work
[14:30:43] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[14:32:22] <skinux> I have it included in my document, but it's not getting loaded up and no errors.
[14:32:46] <robertmaxrees> open your network tab - are you seeing a successful request for it?
[14:33:29] <skinux> https://gist.github.com/skinuxgeek/0b75fd5960c5ad059ad1
[14:33:42] <robertmaxrees> also, you’re missing a doctype there.
[14:34:37] <robertmaxrees> and $(".nav .navbar-nav navbar-right").on('hover', function() { won’t target your navbar-right as an aside.
[14:34:38] <skinux> Nah, I just didn't copy that part
[14:34:53] <robertmaxrees> so are you getting a 404 for the plugin ooor...?
[14:34:56] <skinux> I don't care about the nav stuff right now
[14:35:20] <skinux> No, 404s are for app.js and application-spreadsheet.js neither of which are even being used.
[14:35:29] <robertmaxrees> any errors or anything?
[14:48:11] <skinux> No errors
[14:48:28] <skinux> As if the code isn't referenced at all
[14:50:47] <robertmaxrees> and if you follow the url from your network tab you get the full file?
[14:50:55] <robertmaxrees> because i got nothing if so.
[14:58:59] <skinux> Here's what I see in Network tab http://imgur.com/ECunyty
[15:00:45] <robertmaxrees> that’s why.
[15:01:06] <robertmaxrees> unless application-spreadsheet isn’t the thing you care about.
[15:12:51] <skinux> application-spreadsheet.js is irrelevent.
[15:13:01] <skinux> It has code for different lib.
[15:13:06] <robertmaxrees> then i dunno.
[15:13:39] <skinux> Is there anything else I can do to troubleshoot this?
[15:14:10] <robertmaxrees> fixingthesejquery.com is usually a good guide to looking at this kind of stuff.
[16:27:18] <printForever> I have paragraph of text overflowing the div. I want to contain the text inside the div. I've done that with overflow, and I can add ellipsis via CSS, but I need a jQuery solution.
[16:28:30] <chobocoder> Hi, I have a one page website where I want the menu button to change colour at the last section. It seems to work for the second section but not for the last section - https://jsfiddle.net/vqjwe4ys/
[16:52:15] <chobocoder> anyone?
[16:57:57] <robertmaxrees> “the last section”?
[16:58:10] <robertmaxrees> oh, like the end of the page.
[16:58:41] <robertmaxrees> you need to use if / else if / else if there, and use or statements to filter things.
[16:58:56] <robertmaxrees> also, i’d put $('#menu-button') in a var and reference that instead.
[17:01:09] <chobocoder> no worries, it's fixed. The trouble I was having was in my last DIV, the offset.top wasn't reading the correct value when the window scrolled. I placed a sticky transparent div to the top and once the button passed it, the color now changes
[17:01:22] <robertmaxrees> i’d stil use else ifs in there instead.
[17:01:24] <robertmaxrees> and store that var.
[17:01:26] <robertmaxrees> but awesome.
[17:03:03] <chobocoder> thanks. Yep I'll reference the menu button through the var
[17:27:13] <jeffreylevesque> for both angularjs, and reactjs, is it common convention to have inline js?
[17:27:29] <robertmaxrees> “inline js” like in your templates?
[17:28:34] <jeffreylevesque> the first example in http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2857-hello-world-comparing-reactjs-and-angularjs.htm
[17:28:59] <jeffreylevesque> `<script type="text/jsx">`
[17:29:43] <robertmaxrees> errr, you mean code on the page, not in an external file?
[17:29:51] <jeffreylevesque> yeah
[17:30:01] <robertmaxrees> not that i’ve seen.
[17:31:44] <robertmaxrees> that was likely done that way because it’s easier to see how everything works together.
[17:32:11] <jeffreylevesque> i was just thinking that
[17:32:40] <nad1ed> j #java
[17:32:52] <robertmaxrees> nadel is a good guy.
[17:33:04] <nad1ed> sorry was my mistake :S
[17:33:15] <jeffreylevesque> i still can't decide whether to go for angularjs or reactjs.  If I do angular, i may be able to learn it on another project i may be doing.  But, react seems a little faster?
[17:33:28] <robertmaxrees> wrong considerations to make.
[17:33:33] <robertmaxrees> react and angular both serve different purposes.
[17:33:38] <robertmaxrees> and have different strengths.
[17:34:16] <robertmaxrees> react serves as just the “v” in “MV*” - angular is a wholesale framework.  i personally really prefer react with flux to angular.
[17:34:56] <robertmaxrees> also, learning angular now doesn’t really make sense since 2 will be fundamentally different from 1.
[17:34:58] <jeffreylevesque> what's flux - it integrates with angular?
[17:35:12] <robertmaxrees> with react.
[17:35:29] <robertmaxrees> or anything, really - it’s a standalone deal.  manages your data flows.
[17:39:30] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: what do you mean be "2 will be fundamentally different from 1"?
[17:39:47] <robertmaxrees> angular 2 is very different from angular 1.  lots of reading material out there about it.
[17:39:56] <jeffreylevesque> ah
[17:40:07] <robertmaxrees> or rather, will be.  not sure if it’s out yet.
[17:47:06] <zalem-developer> hoping someone can help.  created an mvc 5 asp.net application.  working fine locally and an in local IIS system.
[17:47:21] <zalem-developer> published it to godaddy hosting server
[17:47:32] <zalem-developer> and the ajax / jquery calls are not working/firing…..godaddy rep doesn’t know…and i’m pulling my hair out
[17:47:46] <robertmaxrees> any errors?
[17:48:47] <zalem-developer> one vague one….downloadable font:  download failed  (font-family:  “kendo ui”
[17:49:21] <robertmaxrees> what about your network tab?
[17:49:38] <robertmaxrees> any CORS issues there when you fire the ajax call?
[17:50:39] <zalem-developer> not that i know of
[17:50:46] <robertmaxrees> err, then go look?
[17:50:51] <zalem-developer> I’m not sure how to look for a CORS issue
[17:50:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:50:56] <robertmaxrees> open your network tab.
[17:51:04] <robertmaxrees> get the ajax request to fire.  see if there’s an error.
[17:51:16] <zalem-developer> this is a shared hosting service
[17:51:19] <zalem-developer> go daddy
[17:51:23] <robertmaxrees> in your browser.
[17:51:28] <robertmaxrees> not in godaddy.
[17:51:37] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[17:52:20] <zalem-developer> i don’t see anything pertinent in the net tab
[17:52:29] <robertmaxrees> check out that guide.
[17:52:35] <robertmaxrees> because i’m flying blind :)
[17:53:34] <zalem-developer> ok…it says 404
[17:53:38] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[17:53:41] <zalem-developer> but it works locally
[17:53:42] <robertmaxrees> bad path.
[17:53:58] <zalem-developer> in visual studio idea AND my local iis
[17:54:07] <zalem-developer> why the hell would i be getting a 404
[17:54:12] <robertmaxrees> file isn’t there?
[17:54:20] <robertmaxrees> that’s literally what 404 means.
[17:55:22] <zalem-developer> crap
[17:55:31] <robertmaxrees> have a link to the page?
[17:55:33] <robertmaxrees> maybe we can look?
[17:56:09] <zalem-developer> do i need to fully qualify the url?  in my ajax call….starting to wonder if i have to
[17:56:14] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:56:19] <robertmaxrees> relative paths work fine.
[17:56:25] <robertmaxrees> just needs to be the correct path.
[18:00:08] <zalem-developer> yeah..the url i have….is missing a component
[18:00:21] <zalem-developer> like i said…it works fine in local environment
[18:00:27] <zalem-developer> i may have to use an absolute path
[18:00:33] <robertmaxrees> you really don’t need to.
[18:00:40] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have something misconfigured.
[18:00:56] <zalem-developer> where in my config? my routes?
[18:01:02] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea about mvc or godaddy.
[18:01:04] <robertmaxrees> soooo....
[18:01:09] <zalem-developer> it’s trying to make ah ok
[18:20:02] <robertmaxrees> zalem-developer what was the issue?
[18:21:13] <zalem-developer> malformed url
[18:21:24] <robertmaxrees> so you got the correct relative path going?
[18:21:51] <zalem-developer> in my $.getJSON  i didn’t put the application name before the controller name
[18:21:56] <robertmaxrees> ah
[18:22:01] <zalem-developer> kind of hard to explain
[18:22:07] <robertmaxrees> nah i know what you’re tlaking about.
[18:22:16] <zalem-developer> you helped me out a lot
[18:22:17] <robertmaxrees> i’m vaguely familiar with the idea.
[18:22:19] <robertmaxrees> cool
[18:58:33] <wolfram74> is anybody familiar with bootstraps tooltips?
[18:58:43] <wolfram74> http://dpaste.com/0P62NEQ

[20:34:49] <adavia_> i am using jquery file upload to upload some images with my form. Any idea why the click event delegation is not working after an ajax request http://pastie.org/10581245
[20:38:23] <billj5> why is this indexLast not working? https://jsfiddle.net/gexnfbos/

[20:40:21] <billj5> docmur: is that a valid attribute?
[20:40:50] <docmur> no, i added it from my php function
[20:48:31] <billj5> like this?
[20:48:32] <billj5> https://jsfiddle.net/pLe02nb8/
[20:49:21] <billj5> use the attr function
[21:00:53] <docmur> I tried that can it doesn't seem to work: http://jsfiddle.net/zv9hLvce/1/
[21:06:25] <billj5> http://jsfiddle.net/zv9hLvce/5/
[21:06:30] <billj5> try that
[21:07:10] <docmur> Exactly what I want :) thanks!

[21:54:02] <g33kyboi> I am using jquery file upload plugin. I have had success with achieving file upload using this plugin but ny challenge is with resizing and croping image. The plugin fails to bring up the cropping dialog and instead fires the submit on the image and uploads right away. Maybe I'm missing something(s). But I have gone through the docs but nothing more I have not tried. Any  help will be appreciated. Here is http://pastebin.com/wqi2z8kk
[21:54:32] <maxxxxi> how the hell did i get here
[22:02:37] <adavia_> g33kyboi: i am also having issues with the same plugin
[22:19:04] <printForever> Can I combine (this) with ID when selecting?
[22:21:44] <rcyr> What do you mean?
[22:22:51] <printForever> I have an IF
[22:22:56] <printForever> searching for an element
[22:22:59] <printForever> once I find it
[22:23:01] <mattt_> How can I select the first li in the first ul under an element whose id is “foo”?  $(‘#foo ul li’) and a variations I’ve tried with nth-child() and nth-of-type() always return a long list of other li elements under the various ul elements.
[22:23:06] <printForever> I need to make changes to the child
[22:23:18] <printForever> that is not relevant
[22:23:34] <printForever> I just want to know if I combine 'this' with #id
[22:28:38] <rcyr> mattt_: #foo ul:first-child li:first-child ? (not sure without seeing your HTML)
[22:29:14] <mattt_> rcyr: yeah, I just discovered eq() and tried ul:eq(0) li:eq(0) and that seemed to do the trick
[22:29:46] <mattt_> but I also just found out the library I’m using isn’t jQuery under the hood, but just plain old document.querySelector() and I don’t think :eq() is valid
[22:30:08] <rcyr> mattt_: Indeed
[22:30:16] <rcyr> :eq is a jQuery-ism
[22:30:25] <rcyr> So try with :first-child
[22:31:01] <printForever> ??
[22:31:04] <printForever> rcyr
[22:31:33] <printForever> combining $(this) plus other selectors
[22:31:38] <printForever> is it possible
[22:31:41] <mattt_> Yep, that works, so does nth-child(1) - next problem is selecting some elements further down the list
[22:31:45] <mattt_> thanks :)
[22:33:58] <printForever> rcyr?
[22:34:16] <rcyr> printForever: It depends on what you want to do
[22:34:31] <rcyr> You want to select an element inside an element "this"
[22:34:32] <rcyr> ?
[22:34:32] <printForever> I want to combine *(this) with ID
[22:34:35] <printForever> yes
[22:34:44] <rcyr> With an ID, it doesn't make sense.
[22:34:51] <rcyr> It would with anything else.
[22:35:11] <printForever> http://pastebin.com/KqWWYGFs
[22:35:42] <rcyr> printForever:Yes, what's up with this code?
[22:35:56] <printForever> am I using this correctly
[22:35:58] <printForever> with find
[22:36:08] <printForever> because nothing is happening
[22:36:47] <rcyr> No, "this" doesn't target a node in your case
[22:36:55] <rcyr> What should be "this"?
[22:37:06] <printForever> 'ul.select2-selection__rendered'
[22:37:52] <rcyr> printForever: You want something like http://pastebin.com/tNEedfEU
[22:38:46] <printForever> still nothing...
[22:38:52] <printForever> what am I doing wrong...
[22:39:16] <printForever> ok
[22:39:21] <printForever> after I run the code in Console
[22:39:26] <printForever> after the page has been loaded
[22:39:29] <printForever> it works
[22:39:38] <printForever> but
[22:39:47] <printForever> its showing on multiple places
[22:39:55] <printForever> thats why I wanted to use THIS
[22:40:04] <printForever> becuase there are several input fields
[22:42:00] <printForever> I'm using https://select2.github.io/examples.html
[22:42:07] <printForever> and I want to add a placeholder text
[22:42:13] <printForever> once the tag is selected
[23:02:43] <adavia_> can i do event delegation using jquery file upload?
[23:06:14] <riskish> Hi. If i'm running this function $(this).stop().animate({"opacity": "1"}, "slow"); how can I "do something" once the animation has finished? i.e. how do i check the animation has completed, so i can do another task
[23:09:08] <rcyr> riskish: animate takes a callback parameter
[23:09:26] <riskish> ah
[23:09:28] <rcyr> Or you can also transform the return value to a promise and .then on it
[23:11:10] <riskish> awesome
[23:11:15] <riskish> that worked, thanks rcyr!
