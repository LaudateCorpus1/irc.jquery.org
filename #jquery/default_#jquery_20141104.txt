[00:03:57] <Macaveli> Morning Cork  still struglingwith my clickable :/
[00:04:02] <rajlaksh> how to add accept="image/*" on radio button check
[00:07:18] <rajlaksh> anyone?
[00:08:29] <clu3> hello all,  i have $foo = $('li'); and now i wanna add another $('div') to this $foo collection (or whatever it's called) so i can use $foo as if $foo = $('li,div'); . I tried $foo.add($div) but .add seems not to accept jqueryObject
[00:08:54] <clu3> any help pls?
[00:18:55] <Elirips> Calling 'abort();' on a $.ajax(); object will not trigger the error-handler, not?
[00:24:46] <liquidcms> can someone please help me out with a scope question?
[00:24:48] <liquidcms> http://pastebin.com/z6Wg3hxS
[00:25:01] <liquidcms> why is dpm(items) empty?
[00:27:19] <Cork> rajlaksh: you mean to the form?
[00:27:52] <Cork> clu3: $foo = $foo.add($div)
[00:28:08] <Cork> Elirips: no it won't
[00:28:57] <Cork> liquidcms: views_datasource_get_view_result is most likely doing ajax or something and triggering the callback async
[00:29:12] <Erwat> that's an impressive function name
[00:29:16] <Cork> so the code inside the block won't have ran when dpm() runs
[00:29:17] <liquidcms> hmm.. yes
[00:29:35] <liquidcms> yea, that makes sense
[00:30:29] <liquidcms> thanks... i'll sort a different way..
[00:30:46] <liquidcms> possibly have it as a function.. and success return results?
[00:30:56] <liquidcms> hmm... think i tried that
[00:31:11] <Cork> you can't return out from async code
[00:31:19] <Cork> call the function from inside the callback
[00:35:28] <liquidcms> yea, i tried that earlier
[00:35:39] <liquidcms> then other parts are out of scope
[00:35:51] <liquidcms> but will try again
[00:39:01] <DevAntoine> hi
[00:39:34] <DevAntoine> I've got a weird issue with $.get. I make two calls, and while these calls aren't resolved they block every other http requests
[00:40:16] <Cork> DevAntoine: only possible reason for that is that you hit the max connection per domain for the browser
[00:40:41] <DevAntoine> Cork: what is it?
[00:40:49] <Cork> depends on the browser
[00:41:01] <Cork> but it ranges from 2 to 5 i think
[00:41:34] <DevAntoine> so two simple ajax requests are blocking the rest of the requests in chromium?! oO That's kinda surprising
[00:42:16] <Cork> DevAntoine: it doesn't have to be just those two
[00:42:30] <Cork> loading images, loading script and so on also counts in that number
[00:42:36] <DevAntoine> Cork: that's the only asynchronous calls I make
[00:42:47] <Cork> loading images, loading script and so on also counts in that number <--
[00:42:49] <DevAntoine> but I can clearly see that these two block the others
[00:43:08] <Cork> check in the network tab how many connections you have open
[00:43:32] <Cork> just checked in my browser and it limits to 6
[00:43:46] <DevAntoine> Cork: what is really weird is that this script is loaded at the end of the page while the other assets are loaded before, but still, these two requests seems to block everything
[00:43:49] <Cork> so it looks like they have raced those numbers lately
[00:44:08] <Cork> DevAntoine: not strange
[00:44:27] <Cork> page loads > content parsed > script ran > resources loaded
[00:44:45] <Cork> so ya, images starts loading after script that run inline
[00:44:52] <Cork> or on dom ready
[00:46:15] <Cork> DevAntoine: http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2008/03/20/roundup-on-parallel-connections/
[00:48:32] <DevAntoine> thanks for the inputs Cork
[00:50:19] <juslintek> Hey, how to pass this as context via ajax?
[00:50:51] <Macaveli> If I have broken code will the code be executed till the broken code and the code after that no more?
[00:51:17] <Cork> juslintek: set the context option
[00:51:23] <Cork> or set a different variable to the content
[00:53:36] <juslintek> so if I want to use $(this) in success I have to use context: $(this), in ajax?
[00:53:49] <juslintek> or I only need to pass this
[00:53:53] <juslintek> without jquery tags
[00:53:54] <Cork> just context: this
[00:53:59] <juslintek> okay
[00:54:08] <Cork> or you can do context: $(this),
[00:54:13] <Cork> and this.find().click()
[00:54:17] <Cork> your choice :)
[00:58:23] <Xatenev> morning
[00:59:00] <Erwat> hey Cork what's wrong with javascript's own event system?
[00:59:21] <Cork> Erwat: why would there be anything wrong with it?
[00:59:46] <Erwat> i'm dealing with code by somebody who's apparently a very experienced js developer and we're using backbone.events instead
[00:59:59] <Erwat> and some jquery events too ( i think?)
[01:00:35] <Erwat> and well, it seems to me like something's wrong with native ones since they're not really used here or much elsewhere
[01:00:45] <Cork> jquery wrappes the native event system
[01:00:51] <Cork> it doesn't replace it
[01:01:10] <Cork> the wrapping is to support things like delegation with preserved bubble order
[01:01:20] <Cork> and things like .off('click')
[01:01:31] <Cork> the later isn't supported nativly
[01:07:54] <fattest> How efficient is my code? When you scroll past a certain section, the <li> should have class active. I have accomplished this, but was wondering if there is a more efficient way? http://jsbin.com/zerugorici/3/edit
[01:09:15] <Cork> fattest: .filter would clean things up
[01:10:39] <Erwat> thank you Cork
[01:20:24] <fattest> Cork: Just as a test, would it be something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/u9v7kLrL/5/
[01:23:33] <fattest> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/u9v7kLrL/10/ like this?
[01:29:54] <fattest> What am I doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/u9v7kLrL/12/
[01:33:32] <Cork> fattest: http://jsfiddle.net/u9v7kLrL/13/
[01:33:44] <Cork> took a while to debug things
[01:33:48] <smee> Hello, I have an object with objects within it. What would the best way to find the maximum value within a specific property?
[01:34:03] <Cork> opps
[01:34:07] <Cork> stray logging
[01:34:12] <Cork> fattest: http://jsfiddle.net/u9v7kLrL/14/
[01:34:40] <Cork> smee: there is really only two options
[01:34:55] <Cork> smee: recessive loop the object
[01:35:07] <Cork> or serialize it to a string and search the string
[01:35:12] <Cork> i recommend the former
[01:35:32] <tyteen4a03> are there any jquery plugins that does element sorting relatively quickly? I heard that tinysort has horrible performance
[01:35:58] <smee> So do you loop through then each time you check it against what you've already searched? So is this bigger than before, if not go on to next, if it is, save as biggest then go on to next?
[01:38:53] <newbie_Jquery> Hi
[01:39:35] <newbie_Jquery> I am trying to use accordion widget of JqueryUi for dynamically created elements
[01:40:20] <newbie_Jquery> Its working properly initially, but when elements are changed later, the widget doesn't work
[01:40:47] <newbie_Jquery> It would be really great if I could get some suggestion on this. Thanks in advance
[01:43:24] <Macaveli> I have a conflict between 2 jquery files Modernizer and jqPagination
[01:43:31] <Cork> newbie_Jquery: when you replace an element all event listeners and ui references is lost
[01:43:40] <Macaveli> How to find the conflict?
[01:43:55] <Cork> newbie_Jquery: event listeners can be fixed by delegating them to a static parent
[01:44:27] <newbie_Jquery> Cork: I have applied the widget to static parent div
[01:44:41] <Cork> widgets doesn't work the same
[01:44:47] <Cork> they need to be rerun on the new element
[01:44:58] <Cork> well most of the time at least
[01:45:22] <newbie_Jquery> Cork: I am rerunning it again when new elements are added
[01:45:28] <newbie_Jquery> but still doesn't work
[01:45:41] <Cork> can't tell without a demo then
[01:46:29] <newbie_Jquery> Should I paste little bit of code in jsfiddle? Will that help ?
[01:46:47] <Cork> it would have to be a demo of the problem
[01:50:15] <fattest> Cork: Thank you so much! But when you scroll all the way down, only the last <li> should have the class active, not all three.
[01:50:37] <Cork> fattest: ah, so only ever the last one?
[01:51:33] <fattest> Cork: It should behave like this http://jsfiddle.net/u9v7kLrL/15/
[01:55:54] <Cork> fattest: http://jsfiddle.net/u9v7kLrL/16/
[01:56:09] <Cork> hmm
[01:56:18] <Cork> feels like this should be possible to optimize...
[01:56:19] <fattest> Thank you so much cork!
[01:56:58] <newbie_Jquery> Cork: I am not sure how to show demo of the problem. I have added little bit of code here : http://jsfiddle.net/6om6jyL3/
[01:58:31] <newbie_Jquery> I hope this will give you some idea of what I am trying to achieve
[01:59:20] <Cork> newbie_Jquery: i can't use that
[01:59:33] <Cork> you need to reproduce the problem else i can't look at what goes wrong
[01:59:39] <Cork> dead code is of little help
[02:01:06] <newbie_Jquery> Cork: Sorry, I am not sure how to make it reproducible. But thanks anyways :)
[02:14:24] <smee> Hello, I am creating a dashboard using jquery. I want to ajax PUT a JSON but only do it once per day (once conditions are met). How can I do this? I thought maybe a 24 hour cookie, but then that would be per user too (which I don't want as multiple people are accessing the same page).
[02:15:06] <Cork> smee: best option is to control this server side
[02:15:13] <Cork> and sett a value for the page to look at
[02:15:44] <Cork> something like <head data-last-check="<timestamp>">
[02:15:53] <smee> Always quick to reply Cork! Thanks. That wouldn't be Jquery then would it? Is this something that's simple to do?
[02:16:12] <Cork> smee: jquery would check the timestamp
[02:16:26] <Cork> or if you have full page loads have a true/false value
[02:17:07] <smee> @Cork - sorry my window doesn't autoscroll. So I could use jquery to check for time since last check and only do something if it goes >24 hours.
[02:17:16] <fattest> Cork: How can I make "home" or the first <li> have an "active" class? ie, "home" should have class active on page load. Should I add another function for this? http://jsfiddle.net/u9v7kLrL/16/
[02:17:17] <DevAntoine> is it better to chain multiple .done() on a promise or one done with a closure containing all the function's calls?
[02:17:24] <smee> Where would I need to set the <head data-last-check="<timestamp>">?
[02:17:26] <Cork> smee: sure
[02:17:33] <Cork> smee: server side
[02:17:44] <Cork> and the server sets when this happened
[02:18:25] <smee> OK, not sure where I would set that on the server though? Is it something that I can set easily within the directory?
[02:18:31] <Cork> DevAntoine: doesn't really matter
[02:18:40] <Cork> DevAntoine: most likely the former as it gives cleaner code
[02:18:58] <Cork> smee: you have server scripting right?
[02:20:25] <Cork> smee: on second though this might be the wrong answer in some cases
[02:20:31] <Cork> what is the situation you're trying to solve?
[02:20:55] <blipped> http://dpaste.com/3GGJK89   I want to use this ajax snippet with multiple django views (at the moment going to /nodes/suggested_nodes). How can I pass this parameter in from the given form element?
[02:22:09] <smee> @Cork - I am using ElasticSearch which I can query using Ajax JSON (you helped me with this before!). I am then saving the query as an object using Jquery. I want to then see if the object meets some conditions, and if it does, I want to then post back new information to the ElasticSearch store (Ajax JSON). However, I only want to post back ONCE otherwise data is duplicated.
[02:23:10] <Cork> smee: uh
[02:23:12] <smee> @Cork - the conditions will be met once a day, and once met will not break until the end of the day. Hence why I only want to write back once a day.
[02:23:19] <Cork> smee: you should do that kind of work server side
[02:23:27] <Cork> integrity should NEVER be done client side
[02:23:32] <DevAntoine> I'm trying to use deferred to get two tables loading, when whatever table is loaded, do some stuff with its data (like inserting the table in the html), and when both table are loaded do some calculations. This is what I've got, but I think I got it completly wrong (and it's not working): http://fixee.org/paste/mgn2xi6/
[02:24:50] <Cork> DevAntoine: ya you first create two promises
[02:24:56] <Cork> then give them to $.when
[02:25:04] <Cork> then you replace those promises with new ones
[02:25:17] <smee> @Cork - So you suggest moving to server side language to do it rather than jQuery?
[02:25:24] <Cork> so nothing will fire cause $.when is listeing for new values
[02:25:27] <DevAntoine> Cork: the problem is that the when is executed before my ajax calls
[02:25:29] <Cork> *old values
[02:25:35] <Cork> ya
[02:25:42] <DevAntoine> but I understand what you're saying
[02:25:44] <Cork> you would have to forward the promise results
[02:26:22] <Cork> $.get().done(ordersPromise.fire); should work
[02:26:35] <Cork> never actually tried that though :)
[02:27:09] <DevAntoine> oh, I see, I'll try
[02:27:17] <DevAntoine> Cork: that's the only way to do what I want?
[02:27:30] <DevAntoine> I'm also wondering about the .two then inside the $.when
[02:28:06] <Cork> .then forwards the original promise so ya, that should work fine
[02:28:18] <Cork> DevAntoine: well that or move the code inside the ready code
[02:28:27] <Cork> i don't see why you need it outside .ready
[02:29:07] <DevAntoine> it seems to work but I don't understand why, because $.when is waiting for promises while .then doesn't return on
[02:29:08] <DevAntoine> one
[02:29:28] <slax0r> hi, I need to find the frist sibling of an element with specific class, would .find be good for this?
[02:29:41] <Cork> DevAntoine: .then forwards the promise you give it
[02:29:49] <DevAntoine> Oh, that's why!
[02:29:59] <fattest> Cork: Should I make the first link have active class like this? http://jsfiddle.net/u9v7kLrL/21/
[02:30:02] <Cork> DevAntoine: then doesn't return what you return in the callback
[02:30:10] <Cork> it returns the instance it runs on
[02:30:11] <DevAntoine> I could easily move the $.when inside the document.ready, but it can leads to lot of code in there
[02:30:30] <Cork> DevAntoine: why would that matter?
[02:31:19] <Cork> fattest: your logic doesn't allow that
[02:31:33] <Cork> as the home section is > scroll top on start
[02:31:55] <Cork> fattest: so manually setting it won't help
[02:32:04] <fattest> i do see
[02:32:05] <DevAntoine> Cork: spaghetti code?
[02:32:43] <Cork> DevAntoine: doesn't become spagetti code cause of that
[02:33:08] <Cork> you can still separate it in functions or what ever you like
[02:33:46] <Cork> trying to have hooks to try to hook into the events makes the code much more complex and harder to read
[02:34:10] <DevAntoine> Cork: true
[02:34:49] <fattest> Cork: how should i do this then?
[02:35:10] <fattest> since I can't set it manually
[02:35:36] <DevAntoine> I thought ptting these ajax calls inside a document.ready wouldn't block loading of assets, but I'm still missing images :'(
[02:36:49] <Cork> fattest: how about http://jsfiddle.net/u9v7kLrL/25/ ?
[02:37:09] <Cork> DevAntoine: ready fires BEFORE loading resources
[02:37:20] <Cork> you would have to wait for the load event
[02:37:51] <DevAntoine> I found that crazy to only have 2 http requests in parallel!!!
[02:37:59] <fattest> Cork: thank you so much
[02:38:07] <Cork> ...
[02:38:21] <Cork> DevAntoine: you're missing half the comments
[02:38:35] <DevAntoine> and it's really weird because the link you gave me about roundup on parallel tells that chrome does at leaqt 6 http queries
[02:38:36] <Cork> DevAntoine: again for the enth time, NO you don't only have two connections
[02:39:00] <Cork> DevAntoine: check your network tab and see what else makes network calls
[02:39:08] <DevAntoine> Cork: I see nothing else loading while the queries are fetching, everything else is in "pending" status
[02:39:39] <Cork> DevAntoine: you could have something crasy like $.ajaxSetup({ async: false }); somewhere i guess
[02:40:01] <DevAntoine> Cork: nop, I'm the only one who coded this project
[02:40:01] <Cork> but except that or max connections there is no other limit by default
[02:41:02] <DevAntoine> something weirder: the pending requests are after loaded from the cache
[02:42:01] <Cork> DevAntoine: instead of trying to monkey patch around the problem look for what blocks you
[02:42:32] <Cork> DevAntoine: another option could be the server limits connections to two per ip
[02:44:08] <frox> hey :-)
[02:45:52] <frox> can someone help me please? why is the accordioneffect not working in the red area? http://ebay.icartech.de/produkte/alpha-s700.html the css is not used and the behaviour of the js isn't as expected.
[02:47:14] <DevAntoine> Cork: the two ajax requests are blocking me. Even one is blocking
[02:49:17] <Cork> DevAntoine: is code still running if you put it directly after the $.get call?
[02:51:42] <DevAntoine> Cork: yes
[02:51:55] <DevAntoine> but I'm starting to wonder if it's not because of php built-in webserver limitations
[02:51:58] <Cork> DevAntoine: then it sounds like this is something server side
[02:52:01] <DevAntoine> I'll try using apache
[03:15:08] <dbugger> Hi guys. Is there a way to know inside the callback for form submission, if the submission was triggered by clicking the submit button, or by pressing ENTER?
[03:15:20] <smee> Hello, what does the following mean/do: $("div[chart-type*=]").each(function () { });
[03:15:20] <Cork> no
[03:15:40] <Cork> dbugger: well you can in firefox but not the other browsers
[03:15:58] <dbugger> Cork: I guess I will have to use some sort of flag and mess around. Thank you
[03:16:13] <Cork> dbugger: best option is to bind a click handler on the button and do $(this).closest('form').data('source', this)
[03:17:05] <Cork> smee: its a broken selector so it would do the same as $('div[chart-type]')
[03:17:07] <dbugger> Cork: Thank you, mate
[03:17:20] <smee> I assume it goes through eery div with chart-type, but not sure what the *= does?
[03:17:29] <Cork> smee: *= means "where the values contains"
[03:17:48] <Cork> but as there is no value it is nullified
[03:18:56] <smee> Ooops, in my example, it should have been =donut]"
[03:19:26] <smee> So it goes through every div with chart-type=donut right and does the function to each?
[03:19:29] <Cork> ok then "loop each div what an attribute where the value contain donut"
[03:19:40] <smee> Thanks! Awesome
[03:19:40] <Cork> *div that
[03:24:48] <smee> @Cork - The actual JS I'm looking at is here: http://codepen.io/drewworthey/pen/dDHvu Line 5 is var max = $(this).data('chart-max'); ---- but I can only see data-chart-max within the HTML. How does it know to ignore the word data before chart-max?
[03:25:31] <Cork> smee: .data looks in its cache
[03:25:42] <Cork> if it isn't in the cache it looks for data- prefixed attributes
[03:26:00] <Cork> .data isn't for reading any none data- prefixed attributes
[03:26:15] <smee> @Cork - you have the answer to everything! Thank you :-)
[04:01:57] <Venko> Hey all, what's the best javascript library for trees of checkboxes and interacting with them? (checking all/unchecking all, expand, collapse, etc). I'm thinking specifically performance-wise with long, long trees
[04:10:20] <murosai> if i clone a node and store it in a variable, later attach this to node to dom and make changes to the node then does the cloned node variable also change?
[04:11:38] <Macaveli> If Ihave the following when IE8 loads but it isn't loading "<!--[if IE 8]><script type="text/javascript" src="/modern.js" ></script>    <html class="no-js lt-ie9" lang="<%= I18n.locale %>"> <![endif]-->"
[04:11:44] <Macaveli> any idea?
[04:18:32] <Cork> murosai: yes dom elements doesn't clone when you point to it from a new variable
[04:18:41] <Cork> murosai: so only way to get a new copy is to clone it
[04:21:37] <decx> Macaveli dont put the script tag there
[04:22:06] <Macaveli> How to include different JS depending on IE version
[04:22:18] <decx> well like that, but not outside of the document
[04:22:34] <decx> put it in the head or in the body
[04:51:35] <smee> Hello, I am looking for some code to check whether a property of an object exists. if(!objectName[carName[i]]["doors" === undefined) {} does not work when carName is also undefined. Is there any way to get round it?
[04:52:38] <smee> Woops, missed the ] there
[04:54:10] <Cork> smee: if('dorrs' in object)
[04:54:19] <Cork> smee: * if('doors' in object)
[04:55:06] <smee> Where object is objectName[carName[i]] ??
[04:55:13] <Cork> yes
[04:55:24] <Cork> the object you want to test for the property
[04:55:48] <Cork> smee: another option is objectName[carName[i]].hasOwnProperty('door')
[04:56:03] <Cork> the later is a bit safer cause it doesn't check the prototype
[04:56:13] <smee> What if the object does not exist?
[04:56:21] <smee> OK
[04:56:22] <Cork> then you will get an exception
[04:56:25] <smee> That's fine
[04:56:28] <smee> Let me try
[04:56:31] <smee> thanks!!
[04:56:34] <Cork> np
[04:56:40] <smee> Really appreciate it.
[04:58:23] <smee> Hmm, so now I get 'Cannot read property 'hasOwnProperty' of undefined
[04:58:48] <Cork> so objectName[carName[i]] === undefined
[04:59:13] <Cork> smee: btw that is also a way to check
[04:59:18] <Cork> if(objectName[carName[i]] === undefined)
[05:00:01] <smee> @Cork - so do I need to do it in two stages. Check if objectName[carName[i]] === undefined, then check if property is undefined?
[05:00:24] <smee> carName is an array [ "Toyota", "Ford", "BMW" ]
[05:00:36] <smee> (You helped me make this before)
[05:00:57] <Cork> smee: so you want to check if carName[i] exist in the objectName?
[05:01:08] <Cork> or look for the door in the later object?
[05:02:57] <smee> @Cork - I have an object with all the cars and their properties (e.g. doors). I want to search through and count how many cars from the array carName have been added to that object and also how many have been added with the property doors/.
[05:04:08] <smee> so I wanted to just check objectName.BMW.doors to see if it exists, but BMW may not exist either.
[05:04:26] <smee> which is where the issue lies.
[05:05:33] <smee> Sorry if that does not make much sense. I'm getting all this information from an Ajax JSON call and putting it in to an object locally.
[05:15:05] <Xatenev> macaveli no idea what u are saying
[05:15:19] <Macaveli> Xatenev?
[05:15:55] <Xatenev> Oh lol
[05:15:57] <Xatenev> Nevermind :D
[05:15:58] <bl4ckdu5t> How can I emulate CSS :hover
[05:16:05] <Xatenev> I wanted to answer on something ago 4 hours or smth
[05:16:13] <Xatenev> Didnt realize im not on the bottom of the chat
[05:16:16] <Xatenev> sorry ^^
[05:16:30] <bl4ckdu5t> onmouseover keeps the change even after the element is not been hovered
[05:21:16] <masterOfNoob> onmouseout?
[05:28:12] <MikeD_> Is there a reason to not do:  myhtml.push( myTag ); /* repeat */   then $( myhtml.join('') ).appendTo( $('#somecontainer') );  ?
[05:34:06] <Erwat> MikeD_: because someone will start crying tears of blood if you do
[05:35:24] <smee> @Cork - sorry, did you have a chance to have a quick look?
[05:36:26] <MikeD_> Erwat: so you suggest a bunch of individual append statements?  (assumes a single-page app loaded from a component .generate() call)
[05:36:44] <Erwat> oh, nevermind, MikeD_
[05:36:51] <Erwat> i was thinking you were doing that on a normal webpage
[05:37:22] <MikeD_> so the tears of blood aren't similarly relevant? :)
[05:50:32] <decx> you dont need to double wrap in appendTo
[05:52:32] <MikeD_> that's good to know
[05:53:12] <lonejack> Hi, some problems on a selectmenu in a dialog box. the drop down menu is shown back to the dialog.. any advices?
[05:59:24] <no_gravity> Hello! Im looking for a way to prevent links from changing the url on touchstart. Any ideas?
[05:59:34] <no_gravity> i tried it like this: $("a").bind("touchstart",function() {alert "hello"});
[05:59:42] <no_gravity> but the alert does not appear.
[06:00:15] <MikeD_> consider using console.log() instead of alert()
[06:00:40] <no_gravity> MikeD_: i have no console on my phone.
[06:00:59] <MikeD_> consider using remote debugging  :p
[06:01:07] <no_gravity> thats a pain in the ass
[06:01:29] <MikeD_> ok then, at least use alert( "hello" );  (note the parenthesis)
[06:02:17] <no_gravity> MikeD_: damn! typo! thank you so much!!
[06:13:50] <Erwat> oh wow
[06:13:57] <Erwat> i never thought of using alert instead of console.log
[06:14:14] <Erwat> thanks no_gravity for teaching me new tricks
[06:14:56] <mooncup> more like old tricks
[06:14:57] <MikeD_> be careful with events that move focus combined with alert, it can be a frustrating mess
[06:15:11] <mooncup> that was the only way to debug before develper consoles became a thing
[06:15:51] <Cork> alerts also refires events
[06:16:08] <Cork> so it is really a bad idea to use it if you want to test an event
[06:16:14] <Cork> just seeing if the event fires is ok
[06:16:26] <Cork> but don't depend on the code flow being correct
[06:31:29] <soee> how can i monitor if attribute changes particular class and fire some action if it happens ?
[06:31:56] <Cork> soee: you can't cross browser
[06:32:32] <soee> ah thats bed
[06:35:23] <bbclover> Hey guys, has anyone ever used a polyfill here to make css properties from html5 compatible with old browsers (particularly IE 9)?
[06:36:28] <Cork> bbclover: sure, depends on the property how feasible it is though
[06:36:34] <MikeD_> heh, I used to use IE7 to make IE6 suck a bit less
[06:37:10] <Cork> ouch
[06:37:21] <Cork> IE7/8/9 SUCKS
[06:37:32] <Cork> i makes the browser way to slow to load the page
[06:37:36] <bbclover> Cork so I'm trying to use a polyfill for the columns property here: https://github.com/BetleyWhitehorne/CSS3MultiColumn now I'm wondering will this javascript only work if the browser doesn't support those properties? or will it always use it when I add the script tag?
[06:38:20] <MikeD_> fyi - it's css3 that you're trying to shim, not technically html5 - but I knew what you meant :)
[06:40:25] <Cork> bbclover: doesn't look like it
[06:40:35] <Cork> MikeD_: technically it does actually
[06:40:51] <MikeD_> does HTML5 mean CSS3 by specification?
[06:40:52] <bbclover> what does shim mean
[06:40:52] <Cork> MikeD_: your mistaking the html standard with the html5 marketing term
[06:41:00] <MikeD_> oh, true.
[06:41:01] <Cork> html5 means everything and nothing
[06:41:06] <MikeD_> like Web 2.0 ?
[06:41:10] <Cork> yes
[06:41:32] <Cork> bbclover: it is a term used for missing javascript apis
[06:41:39] <Cork> so it doens't match for this situation
[06:42:01] <Cork> bbclover: shim is a small javascript block you drop in in place of missing browser features
[06:42:45] <Cork> bbclover: opps sorry
[06:42:53] <Cork> mixed it up with pollfill
[06:43:16] <Cork> but ya, ppl mix up those terms a lot
[06:43:24] <MikeD_> i think of the long scrap of wood that's thin on one end and thicker on the other, used for leveling... like under a table or a windowsill.  You just jam it under the wobbly bit and it stabilizes...
[06:43:49] <bbclover> Cork so this script will always be used in place even if my browser supports those css properties?
[06:44:17] <Cork> bbclover: anyway i skimmed though the project source and couldn't find anywhere it sniffs for support for the property
[06:44:31] <bbclover> so I'll have to use modernizr or sommat
[06:44:46] <Cork> i would prob go that route instead
[06:45:02] <Cork> modernizer a cleaner project
[06:47:32] <bbclover> Cork have you used modernizr before?
[06:47:55] <Cork> i usually opt for not using a feature not supported by all browser i need
[06:48:09] <Cork> unless the feature is easy to pollyfill/shim
[06:48:15] <danrik> if I have an element like this:  $('<dt></dt><dd></dd>'); How do I refer to dt to set it's text?
[06:48:16] <Cork> and then i often write it my self
[06:48:23] <Cork> but ya i have used modernizer
[06:48:33] <Cork> and if i would use a lib for that that one would be it
[06:48:39] <bbclover> k
[06:48:59] <Cork> danrik: that isn't an element
[06:49:01] <Cork> that is two :)
[06:49:23] <Cork> var fragment = $('<dt></dt><dd></dd>'); fragment.filter('dt').text('content');
[06:49:51] <danrik> Cork, ahh. thanks.
[06:53:14] <MikeD_> that's similar to my question - why not put the content inside the <dt> before you parse the string?
[06:57:31] <bbclover> Cork: at the bottom of this page it talks about modernizr: http://webdesign.about.com/od/css3/a/css3-multi-columns.htm and I want the same style sheet to be applied regardless if css columns are supported or not
[06:57:40] <bbclover> but yeah if they're not, use modernizr on that style sheet
[07:00:13] <lonejack> Hi, some problems on a selectmenu in a dialog box. the drop down menu is shown back to the dialog.. any advices?
[07:00:47] <MikeD_> lonejack: make a jsfiddle.net to showcase it?
[07:01:18] <juslintek> Hey, how to make control work on this one? http://jsfiddle.net/Juslintek/mphdpdf1/
[07:01:31] <juslintek> Because it seems keys left and right are not responding.
[07:01:46] <juslintek> Well I get event, I get this, but I do not get next input.
[07:03:17] <juslintek> I want them to work as tab and shift+tab
[07:03:31] <juslintek> previous shift+tab and tab as next
[07:06:16] <lonejack> MikeD_, I would like to do it but... not so able with jsfiddle. Very easy to anable the jquery but how can I enable the jsfiddle to load the jqueryi lib?
[07:06:41] <lonejack> MikeD_, if you teach me I'll prepare the example.
[07:07:35] <tocka> hi guys
[07:07:46] <tocka> has anyone of you used any alternatives to jquery autocomplete?
[07:07:50] <MikeD_> lonejack: do you see the first drop-down on the left?
[07:07:56] <tocka> im trying to use jquery autocomplete + php script
[07:08:03] <tocka> but it takes ages.. :|
[07:08:10] <juslintek> Can someone help me prev and right buttons to work as tab and shift+tab over here. Seems that next can't fetch next elements DOM. http://jsfiddle.net/Juslintek/mphdpdf1/1/
[07:08:14] <tocka> im integrating postcode anywhere service
[07:08:33] <MikeD_> tocka: is that a problem with your php ?
[07:08:45] <tocka> i doubt it
[07:08:48] <tocka> when I load the page
[07:08:52] <tocka> it loads instantly
[07:09:05] <lonejack> MikeD_, I solved, selecting jq 1.9.1 appears the ui option...
[07:09:16] <lonejack> MikeD_, 15'
[07:09:25] <tocka> MikeD_ if you would go here
[07:09:29] <tocka> http://www.postcodeanywhere.co.uk/address-validation/try-it-now/
[07:09:36] <tocka> see for your self how smooth this is
[07:10:51] <MikeD_> seems fine
[07:11:35] <bbclover> MikeD_ have you used modernizr before?
[07:12:35] <MikeD_> i 'used it' by including a reference to it, but i didn't interrogate much after that
[07:13:01] <MikeD_> ultimately the stuff I was working on was too dumb to need much of it
[07:13:33] <MikeD_> I tried to keep it simple because cross-browser fancy involved too much debugging.
[07:13:33] <bbclover> do you remember the modernizr.load() where you have the test yes and no?
[07:14:13] <bbclover> I want the same style sheet to be applied regardless if it's yes or no. I can do that right? And when it's no it'll use modernizr to make the css work?
[07:16:46] <MikeD_> if the script assesses your markup and adds new classes, you will have to update your css
[07:17:27] <MikeD_> so instead of .supercooleffect:hover  you might need .supercooleffect:hover, .supercooleffect_hover { etc. }
[07:18:14] <MikeD_> tbh, if you're using jquery a lot of the CSS selection of elements is already handled - it's the stylesheet that you might need to fixup
[07:22:55] <bbclover> MikeD_ I don't think my css properties need to be changed to use modernizr though
[07:23:00] <bbclover> everything is pretty vanilla, nothing fancy
[07:23:04] <bbclover> I just need the property to be able to work
[07:23:23] <MikeD_> easy enough to try it and see, eh?
[07:23:32] <bbclover> yeah just making sure
[07:23:45] <bbclover> so I can just point to the same style sheet for yes: and no:?
[07:24:09] <bbclover> well they use 'yep;' and 'nope:'
[07:24:09] <MikeD_> load() is about loading .js files
[07:24:37] <bbclover> at the bottom here they're loading css files: http://webdesign.about.com/od/css3/a/css3-multi-columns.htm
[07:26:25] <MikeD_> you probably should just put your link tag in the head and move on to other things
[07:27:40] <lonejack> MikeD_, see this http://jsfiddle.net/t260uyhw/
[07:28:36] <bootstrappp> hello, i am trying to make links from a dropdown button work.
[07:28:43] <bootstrappp> http://getbootstrap.com/components/#btn-dropdowns
[07:28:50] <bootstrappp> the dropdown menu opens up just fine, but for some reason, when i tap on the links, they do nothing
[07:28:56] <bootstrappp> except closing the dropdown...
[07:29:04] <bootstrappp> the same links work great on a desktop computer
[07:29:29] <bootstrappp> any idea what is going on here?
[07:30:45] <lsv_> hey all, I'm having some trouble parsing a json feed and for the life of me I don't know what I'm doing wrong, perhaps someone could take a look? http://jsfiddle.net/xburLp6a/
[07:30:47] <lsv_> :(
[07:37:25] <MikeD_> lonejack: yeah, that's weird
[07:37:43] <jeffreylevesque_> my ajax doesn't prevent redirect
[07:37:45] <jeffreylevesque_> kind of funky
[07:38:17] <lonejack> MikeD_, I posted the problem on jqueryui forum...
[07:38:23] <MikeD_> http://jsfiddle.net/t260uyhw/2/
[07:39:53] <shoky> lsv__: http://jsfiddle.net/xburLp6a/3/
[07:39:57] <hepaestus> Hello
[07:40:28] <MikeD_> lonejack: the only relevant part is the added css, all the other options 1.9, ui, etc. are just messing around with stuff
[07:40:53] <hepaestus> I am using jqmobile and I am getting an error of: "TypeError: $.mobile.document.on is not a function" How do i fix this?
[07:41:51] <jeffreylevesque_> what's wrong with the following - http://pastebin.com/eUEuaa0h
[07:42:07] <lsv__> shoky you rock
[07:42:08] <lsv__> thank you
[07:42:25] <lsv__> i'll exmainie this until I understand it and, if i see further questions later from others, will try to assist
[07:44:46] <lonejack> MikeD_, on your fiddle with chrome... the first time I click on the select the dropdown appears correctly, the second time I obtain the same result before...
[07:45:22] <shoky> jeffreylevesque_: 1) you're not doing event.preventDefault() so the form is probably submitting. 2) typo at end of line 16
[07:45:58] <jeffreylevesque_> shoky, thank you sarge
[07:46:41] <hepaestus> I am trying to use jqmobile and I am getting an error of: "TypeError: $.mobile.document.on is not a function" Anyone else delt with this? I think I have everything set up correctly. :(
[07:46:41] <lonejack> MikeD_, how can be possible that the selectmenu works on your example? The selectmenu is present only after the 1.11.x(do I wrong?)
[07:48:10] <lonejack> MikeD_, okay I undestood
[07:48:33] <lonejack> mantained 1.11.x also on your fiddle
[07:54:01] <jeffreylevesque_> does jquery have nice modal popup where I can attach HTML forms?
[07:59:07] <rohanbhangui> jeffreylevesque_: here is a thought: design one from scratch
[07:59:23] <rohanbhangui> also you can get a barebones of jquery ui and style most of the stuff yourself
[08:01:47] <hepaestus> Anyone know what causes  "TypeError: $.mobile.document.on is not a function"  in jquery mobile?
[08:08:43] <tocka> quick question, has anyone of you had a problem triggering the same autocomplete again on select?
[08:08:49] <tocka> *on option select
[08:10:43] <cjohnson> you'd have to mention which autocomplete thing you're using but if you mean like you type "test", then navigate elsewhere, and want to re-run the test autocomplete, you have to backspace and re-type t ?
[08:11:59] <tocka> one second I will paste the code to fiddle
[08:13:20] <tocka> cjohnson http://jsfiddle.net/127ck7w5/
[08:15:32] <tocka> any ideas? :/
[08:15:34] <Duvdevan> tocka are you from croatia?
[08:15:35] <hepaestus> In JQ Mobile I am getting "TypeError: $.mobile.document.on is not a function" and I can't figure out why! Any Help?
[08:15:43] <tocka> Duvdevan no..
[08:18:29] <linuson> Can someone help me fix the controls for this? Seems like .next('.class-name').focus() is not focusing on next input. What might be wrong in my case?
[08:36:54] <mikehaas763> How is data stored in memory in JS in the browser? Does it usually happen through the use of a listener function that closes over a scope context. So that when the listener function is is fired it has access to an outer state variable? For example, in slickgrid, there are all sorts of events I can subscribe to that then pass in my array of js objects. So I'm wondering how that data is retained when the page isn't
[08:36:55] <mikehaas763> doing something
[08:37:07] <mikehaas763> and I'm not referring to any of the storage options either
[08:38:52] <robertmaxrees> mikehaas763 start here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Memory_Management
[08:39:10] <robertmaxrees> i feel like you have a more specific question, but I'm not exactly sure what it is.
[08:43:58] <Uhkis> "Internet Explorer 6, 7 are known to have a reference-counting garbage collector for DOM objects. For them, a common pattern is known to generate memory leaks systematically"
[08:44:01] <Uhkis> lol
[08:44:19] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[08:44:39] <mikehaas763> I'll go into more detail with my slickgrid example. I make an ajax call and get an array of objects. I then pass that array to slickgrid which then renders a grid from the data (just the first 10 items). At this point, all the scripts have finished executing. Then, I click the next page button, which fires an event listener. The event listener has the entire array of data passed in. Where does this data come from if
[08:44:39] <mikehaas763> another ajax request has not been made? I'm guessing it's just through the use of "state" variables located in outer scopes?
[08:45:15] <robertmaxrees> depends entirely on how you're getting data, how things are scoped, and what slickgrid is doing./
[08:45:42] <robertmaxrees> does your grid dealio have an option to only show x amount at a time and do pagination?
[08:45:53] <mikehaas763> robertmaxrees, yes
[08:45:59] <robertmaxrees> Then it manages that for you.
[08:46:09] <robertmaxrees> it probably passes around the reference to the returned data.
[08:46:15] <mikehaas763> Well, it provides hooks so it can be implemented
[08:47:09] <mikehaas763> If the slickgrid scripts have finished executing (there is no execution loop), how does it have access to the array of data I originally passed in?
[08:49:03] <mikehaas763> I don't really have a specific question I'm just curious and was thinking about it
[08:49:24] <Uhkis> you may wanna try ##javascript
[08:54:21] <robertmaxrees> mikehaas763 javascript stores tha array as an object in memory.  it's about that simple.
[08:54:33] <robertmaxrees> it's setup so you don't have to worry about it.
[08:57:32] <shanee> Hello. I moved everything into a div before but I'm now wondering how I can move it out again. Is there a better way to do this than getting the inside with .html() and just replacing the element with that?
[08:59:15] <robertmaxrees> shanee hrm?
[08:59:22] <robertmaxrees> can you share an example?
[09:28:02] <shanee> robertmaxrees, I think I got it with $("#elm").children().unwrap();
[09:28:21] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.  not entirely sure what you were looking for, but awesome! :)
[09:35:58] <Korvin> is there a way to xor select?
[09:36:35] <Korvin> something like $('.some_class | .other_class') so that it selects EITHER some_class OR other_class and not both
[09:38:16] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to use .not() or :not()
[09:39:16] <robertmaxrees> something like var $whatIWant = $('.some_class').not('.another_class').add($('.another_class').not('.some_class'));
[09:40:15] <doug64k> robertmaxrees: I think raw css can do that but I'll spare you :D
[09:40:23] <doug64k> same way
[09:40:26] <robertmaxrees> or using the CSS3 selector: var $whatIWant = $('.some_class:not(.another_class)').add($('.another_class:not(.some_class)');
[09:40:32] <robertmaxrees> that's why I mentioned :not()
[09:40:34] <doug64k> yes that :)
[09:40:48] <robertmaxrees> *raw CSS3
[09:41:14] <robertmaxrees> i tend to prefer chaining personally.
[09:41:50] <Korvin> robertmaxrees: not worth it
[09:41:59] <robertmaxrees> what isn't?
[09:42:18] <Korvin> the only reason I'd use an xor is because it could intelligently grab both results as it searched
[09:42:37] <Korvin> it could either stop at the first one, or stop at the second one. What you describe searches the dom twice
[09:42:48] <doug64k> robertmaxrees solution is an xor
[09:42:51] <linuson> Can anyone hel me with this one? http://jsfiddle.net/Juslintek/mphdpdf1/
[09:43:01] <linuson> I need to make .next swtich to next input
[09:43:21] <linuson> its not focusing next input on keydown 39
[09:43:35] <robertmaxrees> Korvin it really depends on what you need at the end of the day.
[09:43:36] <linuson> and on keydown 37 not switching to previous one
[09:43:54] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[09:43:54] <BillCriswell> Korvin: $('.some_class,.other_class').eq(0) would be pretty cheap.
[09:44:16] <doug64k> BillCriswell: that is or, not xor
[09:44:23] <Korvin> ^^
[09:44:26] <Korvin> but that's close :)
[09:44:52] <BillCriswell> I know, but it's still pretty cheap.
[09:44:53] <robertmaxrees> you could also run your selector once for $('.some_class, .other_class') and then .filter() the results.
[09:45:03] <Korvin> robertmaxrees: that's what I ended up doing
[09:45:27] <blez> so I have $('#button1').on('click', ...) in <head> but button1 is not created when the script is executed
[09:45:35] <blez> what should I use to bind to it when it's created?
[09:45:43] <robertmaxrees> blez wrap it in a document ready or put your code before </body>
[09:45:51] <robertmaxrees> alternatively you can use event delegation.
[09:46:22] <blez> event delegation
[09:46:24] <blez> ?
[09:46:45] <doug64k> linuson: prev can't work - the <input> has no siblings right? you probably need .parent().prev().children('input')
[09:46:50] <blez> I tried with .live() but with jquery 1.11.1 it says there is no .live()
[09:46:57] <robertmaxrees> blez http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[09:47:06] <robertmaxrees> blez you use .on() for delegation.
[09:47:52] <doug64k> linuson: if you don't know the next field over will be an input, use something more permissive in the children call
[09:48:24] <linuson> doug64k, Don't know what word permissive means
[09:50:13] <robertmaxrees> linuson btw you want to fix your markup.
[09:50:30] <linuson> doug64k, there is one form wrapping all those inputs, each input has td
[09:50:44] <robertmaxrees> oh that's right col is a void element.
[09:51:11] <linuson> robertmaxress, by void element what do you mean? it returns nothing?
[09:51:16] <linuson> Or it is deprecated?
[09:51:22] <robertmaxrees> <col> doesn't have contents - you're fine.
[09:51:28] <robertmaxrees> ignore me :)
[09:51:52] <linuson> robertmaxrees, okay. :-) It php generated output. :-)
[09:52:05] <blez> robertmaxrees if I have $(document).ready() several times will they all execute on document ready?
[09:52:15] <robertmaxrees> blez basically.
[09:54:13] <linuson> doug64k, $(this).parent().prev('.table-input-cell').focus(); does nothing.
[09:55:21] <linuson> same as this: $(this).parent().prev().children('.table-input-cell').focus();
[09:56:37] <doug64k> linuson: working on your fiddle
[10:02:54] <doug64k> jsfiddle is very slow for me
[10:05:20] <tejas-manohar> anyone understand how this works? https://github.com/mindmup/editable-table
[10:05:35] <tejas-manohar> i dont see it even workingi n the linked example - https://mindmup.github.io/editable-table/
[10:06:06] <doug64k> linuson: I have it almost done if jsfiddle would update in less than a minute :(
[10:06:07] <robertmaxrees> http://mindmup.github.io/editable-table/
[10:06:20] <robertmaxrees> works fine, tejas-manohar
[10:06:59] <tejas-manohar> robertmaxrees: is that table editable in your browser when u load page? https://mindmup.github.io/editable-table/
[10:07:06] <robertmaxrees> drop the s.
[10:07:21] <robertmaxrees>  http://mindmup.github.io/editable-table/ works - the https breaks it.
[10:07:24] <robertmaxrees> not sure why.
[10:07:33] <tejas-manohar> wow lol
[10:07:41] <tejas-manohar> i have an enforce ssl browser extension :P
[10:08:20] <carczar> hello, how can I make it so that the background fade from one to another on mouse over? http://jsfiddle.net/20p15knp/1/ (instead of just instantly swapping?)
[10:09:19] <doug64k> I know whaty's going on - I have a page with 100 iframes open and its got all my FF browser tabs slowed to a crawl
[10:10:01] <robertmaxrees> carczar http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17825194/fade-in-background-jquery
[10:11:45] <linuson> doug64k, just delete one section of rows and it will speed up. Too much html.
[10:11:56] <carczar> robertmaxrees: thanks
[10:14:45] <doug64k> linuson: hey wait, if they are inputs, you can't really use arrow left and right to move between cells, how are they supposed to move the cursor?
[10:15:54] <robertmaxrees> sure he can.
[10:15:59] <linuson> on input.maxlength > 2
[10:16:11] <linuson> or shift+tab
[10:16:46] <linuson> robertmaxrees, how to trigger tab or shift+tab?
[10:17:03] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[10:17:20] <robertmaxrees> pull out your logic and run it when they hit the arrow.
[10:17:35] <linuson> robertmaxrees, than what is the best way to jump between inputs of the same class wrapped within td under same form?
[10:17:48] <linuson> imagine excel table
[10:17:49] <robertmaxrees> read what i just said.
[10:17:54] <robertmaxrees> don't triggler tab or shift+tab
[10:18:03] <robertmaxrees> just run the logic when you press the button instead.
[10:20:28] <doug64k> Lindrian: almost done
[10:20:30] <linuson> robertmaxrees, and that logics suppost to look like what? Do I have to get whole row and count all children in the row, or to do same with columns. Or parse my id which I generated into numbers and if next id parse number is higher go to next one if lower do nothing and same with prev?
[10:21:14] <robertmaxrees> linuson it really depends.  if you have some kind of numeric grid-thing you can use to count, then go with parsing that info out.
[10:21:28] <robertmaxrees> data-x and data-y attributes would be neat for that if you can generate the server-side.
[10:21:47] <robertmaxrees> or parse out column and row width
[10:22:00] <doug64k> each update or run on jsfiddle takes (literally) a minute. idk whatsgoing on
[10:23:51] <doug64k> 3wire engineers - your hardware is terrible. how do you sleep at night?
[10:24:29] <rhp> on a bed of dollars probably
[10:24:30] <doug64k> linuson: almost http://jsfiddle.net/mphdpdf1/10/
[10:25:01] <doug64k> nope, that's it... colspan is going to cause you grief
[10:25:24] <doug64k> and rowspan
[10:26:48] <doug64k> the second and subsequent rows after a row with rowspan will have one less cell per row which throws it off
[10:26:52] <robertmaxrees> holy christ that's a big fiddle
[10:27:01] <robertmaxrees> alomost 20,000 lines of markup.
[10:27:56] <doug64k> tables have awful performance. every time a molecule of air touches the screen it reflows the page
[10:29:47] <doug64k> linuson: that fiddle works... with colspan/rowspan issues
[10:29:49] <decx> 20000 neat
[10:29:58] <decx> that's not a fiddle that's a contrabass
[10:30:05] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[10:30:13] <robertmaxrees> great example of "not a minimal case"
[10:30:32] <doug64k> linuson: oh, and this is not a good idea: style="background: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-radius: 0px; border: 0px currentColor; border-image: none; width: 17px; height: 100%; text-align: center; font-size: 12px; box-shadow: none;"
[10:30:51] <doug64k> use a css class
[10:31:41] <doug64k> thankfully the days of spamming 20 attributes on everything are behind us, along with trumpet winsock and win 3.1
[10:33:07] <doug64k> robertmaxrees: a couple of hundred more lines of html and that fiddle becomes a denial of service attack on #jquery :D
[10:33:25] <doug64k> #jquery users*
[10:34:41] <doug64k> linuson: you there?
[10:35:33] <cjohnson> pfft, classes are overrated
[10:35:37] <cjohnson> inline styles are the way of hte future
[10:36:41] <doug64k> who remembers trumpet winsock and netscape and altavista, and trying a website on the other side of the world, overly amused by the lack of long distance charges
[10:42:14] <nettoweb_> can someone suggest some simple captcha plugin with jquery?
[10:44:03] <cjohnson> recaptcha is decent
[10:44:14] <cjohnson> but captcha is generally not very useful
[10:44:19] <cjohnson> except specific use cases
[10:45:39] <MikeD_> do we like the .tabs() feature of ui ?
[10:46:16] <nettoweb_> cjohnson whats the alternative?
[10:46:30] <jamescooper> hello
[10:53:34] <jsc802> can someone help me figure out why i am unable to do a cross domain request
[10:53:39] <jsc802> cross subdomain
[10:54:09] <jsc802> looking at this page https://www.lunabazaar.com/popup-test.aspx
[10:54:34] <jsc802> fuck.php starts with  <?php  header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *");
[10:55:59] <robertmaxrees> jsc802 check the headers in the network tab of your dev tools
[11:00:18] <jsc802> thanks i think i got it
[11:11:30] <guy12345> anybody familiar with using jquery in order to navigate the DOM for inserting a chrome extension like "Rapportive" into the Gmail Peoples Widget section on the right side of gmail
[11:12:16] <guy12345> Or, familiar inserting a gmail extension into the right-side area of an open email inside of gmail
[11:12:26] <guy12345> like the location of the "peoples widget"
[11:12:41] <robertmaxrees> wut
[11:13:09] <guy12345> @robtermaxrees confused on what I am asking?
[11:13:23] <robertmaxrees> 1st: this isn't twitter ;)
[11:13:33] <robertmaxrees> 2nd you'd use it like you would anywhere else.
[11:13:40] <robertmaxrees> build your object and place it whever.
[11:14:17] <guy12345> ahaha 0_0 my bad dude
[11:14:28] <robertmaxrees> it's all good lol
[11:16:13] <guy12345> I'm sort of a scrub ... but, been trying to dev a gmail extension that shows up on the right side of each opened email. I have the php side complete, where user information (in respect to the FROM email) is displayed, however, I am trying to sort out how to place that info to the right of the email since it is not a "contenxtual widget"
[11:17:34] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need a channel dedicated to plugin development.
[11:18:23] <guy12345> I have been looking for one for a good half of my morning :/
[11:21:44] <robertmaxrees> guy12345 check #chromium-extensions
[11:24:17] <tharkun> This should work but I have no idea why it is not. Any hints? http://jsfiddle.net/q11mkrny/
[11:24:44] <robertmaxrees> var el = document.getElementById(aparece); doesn't work
[11:25:08] <robertmaxrees> you want var el = document.getElementById('aparece');
[11:26:20] <tharkun> Still not working
[11:26:53] <tharkun> I expect the text to apear when the button is pressed. Am I on the right track?
[11:26:54] <robertmaxrees> you mean in the fiddle?  because you also don't have jquery included.
[11:27:03] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/q11mkrny/2/
[11:28:09] <tharkun> robertmaxrees: Thanks first time I used jsfiddle.net.
[11:28:17] <robertmaxrees> ah
[11:28:40] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/SQMItg0.png
[11:28:44] <robertmaxrees> that's the dropdown you want.
[11:29:43] <guy12345> so, no replies in either #chromium extensions or #chromium-support :/
[11:30:31] <robertmaxrees> guy12345 that doesn't change this channel's topic :)
[11:30:55] <robertmaxrees> i can help you write the JS that inserts stuff just fine, but i don't know anything about writing chrome extensions.
[11:30:56] <guy12345> lol, fair enough.
[11:31:17] <guy12345> The JS that inserts stuff is all i need
[11:31:39] <guy12345> So... if you are able to assist - I would be forever grateful
[11:31:46] <robertmaxrees> okay - how far have you gotten?
[11:32:41] <guy12345> I have been using the gmail-righttasks github repo as a sort of sandbox for me
[11:32:56] <robertmaxrees> for the javascript i mean.
[11:33:04] <robertmaxrees> for appending code
[11:33:42] <guy12345> Since I have all my PHP user information responses in JSON format, all I have to complete is displaying the response inside the sidebar context
[11:34:26] <robertmaxrees> right - you want to append some HTMl into somewhere ;)
[11:34:36] <robertmaxrees> that's your end goal, right?
[11:35:24] <guy12345> aye aye Captain
[11:35:36] <robertmaxrees> okay - so how far have you gotten for that?
[11:35:37] <robertmaxrees> code wise.
[11:36:56] <guy12345> some very missguided attempts at modifying the accessing the container elements of the GMAIL ui - checking for the page body to load before appending my HTML
[11:37:14] <guy12345> modifying and accessing **
[11:38:25] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to figure out what level of familiarity you have with JS/JQ, because appending stuff is super trivial - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/93ayben1/
[11:39:10] <robertmaxrees> so it'd be nice to understand exactly where you're getting stuck.
[11:39:44] <scar3> ok so if i hide something with slideDown or hide or something, how can i "reset" what was done to that object by jquery, so it can fall back to the CSS it had before js/jquery manipulated it?
[11:40:02] <guy12345> Ah, ok. So, I am having an issue navigating to the correct element in which I would like to append my HTML. Let me send you an imgur pic to demonstrate what I am dealing with... lol
[11:40:19] <robertmaxrees> guy12345 are you familiar with your browser's developer tools?
[11:41:02] <robertmaxrees> scar3 you can set styles on the element.
[11:41:06] <robertmaxrees> but there's no real "reset" afaik
[11:41:06] <guy12345> yeah
[11:41:18] <guy12345> that's what I am going to show you a screen shot off in terms of the Elements
[11:41:51] <scar3> robertmaxrees, damn so i just need to cehck the inline style="" on the element?
[11:42:01] <robertmaxrees> scar3 use .css()
[11:42:39] <robertmaxrees> or add/remove your own classes and do everything via CSS instead.
[11:42:41] <scar3> well yeah but i mean i need to check what jquery has done to the object to see what needs to be offset, etc
[11:42:54] <guy12345> http://imgur.com/jgonhPi
[11:42:57] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to store that state beforehand, which is hacky.
[11:42:59] <scar3> well if i do .hide() it overridesd my css classes
[11:43:02] <scar3> well
[11:43:16] <robertmaxrees> right, so use .addClass() and .removeClass() and go that route instead.
[11:43:18] <scar3> no, i meant manually check. like hide() for example. i would see what hide() does inline style as a test THEN know what to do
[11:43:21] <scar3> ahh
[11:43:23] <scar3> i see what you mean
[11:43:33] <robertmaxrees> guy12345 you have IDs and Classes available there - i'm not sure why you're confused.
[11:43:53] <guy12345> dw is the element where the righttasks chrome plugin appends itself and then it has all of those tags below in which the ENTIRE gmail interface exists and then the plugin appends itself only where it desires ... lol
[11:44:14] <robertmaxrees> i'm still not sure what you need help with.
[11:45:00] <guy12345> suppose, what is the best way to navigate that with the document.get ElementById call
[11:45:17] <robertmaxrees> document.getElementById() selects an ID.
[11:45:27] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean by "the best"
[11:45:50] <robertmaxrees> you could select the element you want to modify, or you could select the element you want to insert things after.
[11:46:04] <robertmaxrees> you could use document.querySelector() and use a CSS selector instead.
[11:46:19] <guy12345> so getElementById will not need a list of IDs to traverse - sort of like a datastructure like a "tree" but only the desired ID?
[11:46:35] <robertmaxrees> document.getElementById() takes one ID
[11:47:12] <robertmaxrees> document.getElementById('someID'); <- this returns the element with the id of "someID".  <div id="someID"></div>, for example.
[11:47:49] <guy12345> ahh ok - I understand now!
[11:48:13] <guy12345> And then, I can just apply my styles via appendChild(cssnode)
[11:48:15] <robertmaxrees> document.querySelector('#someID') will do basically the same thing.  you could also use jquery if it's available and do $('#someID') to get the jquery object back.
[11:48:27] <robertmaxrees> wait are you just trying to append some CSS?
[11:48:31] <guy12345> in the case of having an Iframe
[11:48:42] <robertmaxrees> you can just append those styles anywhere in the frame.
[11:48:52] <robertmaxrees> append them to the body and be done with it.
[11:49:19] <guy12345> I am trying to append some HTML and CSS - so apply both methods you ahve recommended?
[11:49:46] <robertmaxrees> append html the way we talked about.
[11:49:52] <tharkun> I'm extremely puzzled why this does not work http://paste.ubuntu.com/8823788/
[11:49:59] <tharkun> Any ideas what might be wrong?
[11:50:17] <guy12345> since I am trying to display the html formatted JSON of my PHP response and have CSS styling associated wtih my APPENDED html inside of an iframe inside of the GMAIL ui
[11:50:18] <guy12345> lol
[11:50:21] <robertmaxrees> guy12345 for css you should either include a link to an external stylesheet or edit those nodes.  don't append a style tag with css in it.
[11:50:45] <robertmaxrees> tharkun #toggle doesn't yet exist.
[11:50:49] <cohitre> tharkun: you have to wrap your initialization script with document.ready
[11:51:00] <robertmaxrees> wrap your code in a document ready or move it to just before </body>
[11:51:10] <guideX> say I have a table I'm appending to, how do I append before the last tr?
[11:51:21] <guideX> say the last tr is a button row
[11:51:54] <robertmaxrees> $('table tr').last().before('<tr><td></td></tr>')
[11:52:05] <guideX> oh hmm... what if it was two items up
[11:52:06] <tharkun> robertmaxrees: sorry I didn't realize that. ;P
[11:52:13] <tharkun> cohitre: Thanks I'll  look into it.
[11:52:15] <robertmaxrees> guideX you can use .eq(-2)
[11:52:21] <robertmaxrees> or .eq(-1) for the last.
[11:52:27] <guideX> oh ok
[11:52:37] <guideX> thanks I'll try it
[11:52:46] <guideX> so .eq(-1).append(blah)?
[11:52:52] <robertmaxrees> .before()
[11:52:55] <guideX> ah ok
[11:52:56] <robertmaxrees> if you want content before it.
[11:57:22] <threexk> hello.  How can you select elements with one of several attributes?  For instance, select both option[value="foo"] and option[value="bar"]?
[11:57:45] <robertmaxrees> $('option[value="foo"],  option[value="bar"]')
[11:58:43] <threexk> robertmaxrees: thanks.  If the selector is long I will need to duplicate it then?  Or can you put commas in the middle?
[11:58:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:58:56] <robertmaxrees> you have to do them all like that.
[11:59:04] <robertmaxrees> if you have a lot, give them all a class instead and select that.
[11:59:27] <threexk> robertmaxrees: OK, that makes sense, thanks
[12:00:13] <threexk> (the actual selector I am working with now is select.form-select.required:has(option:selected[value="_none"])
[12:00:29] <robertmaxrees> woah
[12:00:49] <robertmaxrees> drop the tags from your selectors btw.
[12:01:09] <robertmaxrees> check this out for more info: http://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
[12:02:44] <threexk> robertmaxrees: thanks again
[12:05:15] <tharkun> robertmaxrees, cohitre: Thanks everything is working fine on the displayed page. Next stop AJAX :)
[12:06:25] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[12:15:03] <doug64k> lol
[12:16:05] <doug64k> threexk: robert isn't a fan of complex css selectors in jquery, was funny to see his reaction :D
[12:17:33] <robertmaxrees> the guide explains why ;)
[12:18:11] <doug64k> they're almost like regexes. they seem to slick and cool until it is so big and complex that it is meaningless without sitting there and analyzing it
[12:18:24] <robertmaxrees> right.  there's also a time and a place.
[12:19:20] <robertmaxrees> looking to do some complex selector?  see if adding a class or something in your backend wouldn't be easier.
[12:28:43] <guideX> so what other albums are absolutely as amazing as 10,000 fists which are also by disturbed
[12:28:59] <guideX> I want to stay on this disturbed kick
[12:29:06] <guideX> oops wrong chan :P
[12:29:13] <robertmaxrees> i was about to say hahahaha
[12:34:24] <torbjorn> is it possible to have the data-clear-btn do something else than blanking out the input?
[12:34:37] <torbjorn> id like it to reset it to an othewise predetermined start value
[12:57:16] <doug64k> torbjorn: what "data-clear-btn"
[12:57:27] <robertmaxrees> isn't that jquery mobile?
[12:57:53] <robertmaxrees> yeah - you could setup an event listener to change the default behavior.
[12:57:54] <doug64k> yeah it is
[12:58:06] <fabiobik> how do i get an iframe name that is assigned dynamicly? (facebook)
[12:58:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:58:31] <robertmaxrees> $('iframe').prop('name') ?
[12:58:35] <doug64k> fabiobik: you can find the element right?
[12:58:54] <fabiobik> doug64k: gives me undefined
[12:59:04] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ fabiobik
[12:59:04] <b-ot> fabiobik: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:59:06] <robertmaxrees> and with that, lunch
[12:59:27] <doug64k> fabiobik: what gives you undefined
[12:59:44] <fabiobik>         alert($('iframe').attr('name'));
[12:59:52] <doug64k> fabiobik: use prop, not attr
[13:00:23] <fabiobik> doug64k: if i paste that on chrome terminal, it works
[13:00:27] <fabiobik> returns me the name
[13:00:39] <doug64k> fabiobik: and?
[13:00:44] <fabiobik> but if i paste that on $(window).load(
[13:00:52] <fabiobik> gives me undefined
[13:01:03] <doug64k> it's a coincidence that it worked. prop reads the actual object, attr reads the html that it was born from
[13:01:16] <fabiobik> okay
[13:02:15] <doug64k> fabiobik: because onload is too early - the iframe fires a load event when *it* loads
[13:02:49] <doug64k> I don't think it waits for nested iframes to all finish loading
[13:03:20] <fabiobik> doug64k: so what is the best place? $(document).ready(   ?
[13:03:48] <doug64k> fabiobik: you want me to guess? I don't even know what creates the iframe or when
[13:03:55] <fabiobik> doug64k: http://go2web4free.com/fblike
[13:07:29] <fabiobik> doug64k: can you see?
[13:07:52] <doug64k> I see a lot of minified that are all one 8000 character line, yeah
[13:08:18] <fabiobik> wich script?
[13:08:22] <fabiobik> *witch
[13:08:34] <doug64k> you tell me
[13:08:34] <Robdgreat> *which?
[13:08:44] <doug64k>  /
[13:08:45] <fabiobik> Robdgreat: thnks :D
[13:09:16] <fabiobik> i thought that this would be more easy...
[13:09:57] <doug64k> halloween was a few days ago
[13:10:20] * doug64k scans the room for grammar cops
[13:11:26] <fabiobik> doug64k: very funny...
[13:13:10] <jeffreylevesque_> could someone help me correct the following syntax
[13:13:15] <jeffreylevesque_>  this.on('mousemove', 'function(event) { ... });
[13:13:30] <Robdgreat> doug64k: that's usage. fabiobik got the whole word wrong
[13:14:00] <Robdgreat> :D
[13:14:22] <fabiobik> i'm not english...
[13:14:57] <fabiobik> i'm more than happy of my current english
[13:15:27] <Robdgreat> fabiobik: wasn't criticizing you, was correcting doug64k  ;)
[13:16:38] <fabiobik> Robdgreat: i've understand it. i'm talkinf to doug64k
[13:16:53] <wldcordeiro> I have a strange problem with the hide() function. It seems to break my image loading by causing the images to first stack (no images loaded just the alt text) then load.
[13:17:21] <wldcordeiro> You can see the example of this here -> https://staging.zionsdirect.com/zions-tv/
[13:18:17] <wldcordeiro> the sliders are displayed as part of a a $(selector).hide().append(content).fadeIn(1000); chained call.
[13:18:27] <wldcordeiro> But the fade isn't occurring and the images are loading weird.
[13:27:25] <fabiobik> How do i get the name attribute of an iframe that is assigned dynamicly?
[13:27:52] <NoiseEee> search for $('iframe') and grab the name prop?
[13:27:54] <frothnicator> I'm struggling to make a radio button checked.  I've done many variants of this:
[13:27:57] <frothnicator> $container.find('[value="yes"]').prop('checked', true);
[13:28:02] <frothnicator> but it will not present as checked in the browser.  (Many variants means, 'defaultChecked', .attr('checked', 'checked'), and so on).  Is there a detail I'm missing?
[13:28:18] <fabiobik> NoiseEee: not work... give me undefined
[13:28:38] <NoiseEee> fabiobik: what is $('iframe') ?
[13:29:08] <fabiobik> NoiseEee: what you mean xD
[13:29:22] <frothnicator> does it matter that I have not added it to the DOM yet?  because I can't add it to the DOM at the point I have the data to know that it should be checked.
[13:29:32] <fabiobik> im trying this  alert($('iframe').prop('name'));
[13:29:43] <torbjorn> doug64k: yes, jquery-mobile
[13:30:09] <NoiseEee> fabiobik: look at your console instead, and replace that with console.log($('iframe'));
[13:30:41] <fabiobik> NoiseEee: okay, let me try
[13:31:39] <fabiobik> NoiseEee: okay, gives me undefined
[13:31:48] <NoiseEee> fabiobik: then you have no iframe in the document
[13:31:57] <Robdgreat> you have no iframe of reference!
[13:32:16] <fabiobik> NoiseEee: initially no, but the facebook adds it
[13:32:30] <NoiseEee> fabiobik: well i guess you'll have to wait until its added before you go asking about it :)
[13:33:04] <fabiobik> NoiseEee: like $(document).ready( ?
[13:33:34] <NoiseEee> fabiobik: i don't think so - i'd guess the doc is ready before facebook adds an iframe
[13:33:47] <fabiobik> i've tryied that and $(window).onload
[13:34:05] <NoiseEee> try a timeout or google about it; personally i've no experience with facebook stuff
[13:43:54] <SpaceF_> how can you split a string with either a ? parameter or a & parameter
[13:44:00] <SpaceF_> with regex
[13:44:43] <doug64k> SpaceF_: yes
[13:49:06] <SpaceF_> doug64k: split('/\?|&') isn't working
[13:51:45] <cohitre> SpaceF_: if you want to declare a regular expression you ahve to use / around it
[13:52:01] <cohitre> ‘’ will create a string
[13:52:11] <SpaceF_> I had to set a variable as the regular expression and use it
[13:52:18] <SpaceF_> instead of trying to use a string
[13:55:17] <txp> hey guys, I'm playing around with $(this).hasClass("foo") - but it seems that "this" isn't the object I expect... Any tricks how to get some information about "this" - alert just gave me "[object Object]" which isn't very helpful...
[13:55:31] <BillCriswell> SpaceF_: new RegExp() ?
[13:55:57] <SpaceF_> no just regex = /\?|&/g;
[13:56:02] <doug64k> SpaceF_: not great, but it works: s.match(/\?(.*)/)[1].split('&').reduce(function(a, v) { var kvp = v.match(/^([^=]+)=(.*)$/); a[kvp[1]] = kvp[2]; return a; }, {})
[13:56:03] <SpaceF_> split(regex)
[13:56:10] <BillCriswell> Oh.
[13:56:37] <doug64k> SpaceF_: but that's if you force me to use regexes. I would do it with split myself
[13:57:09] <doug64k> SpaceF_: first split on '?' then on '&' then on '='
[13:57:13] <BillCriswell> I thought you meant you needed to use a variable in the regular expression.
[13:57:27] <SpaceF_> I don't need the equals
[13:58:06] <doug64k> SpaceF_: you know what ruins this task? js has no way to limit the split()
[13:58:30] <SpaceF_> right, but I'm already splitting a string once
[13:58:55] <SpaceF_> prior to it going into this split
[13:59:00] <SpaceF_> so it's controlled
[13:59:32] <doug64k> SpaceF_: var pathQuery = url.split('?'); var items = pathQuery[1].split('&')
[13:59:47] <doug64k> with appropriate checking for length of pathQuery result
[14:00:05] <MarioD> Can anybody help me outputting an object: http://jsfiddle.net/srkpp276/ dongerParts.val outputs as just that a val object, instead of the item from the array. How can I get it use the actual value from the array instead of a val string?
[14:00:50] <MarioD> so I'd like it to be dongerParts.arms, dongerParts.body etc
[14:02:40] <doug64k> MarioD: no way of knowing what 'data' is in that code
[14:03:29] <cohitre> MarioD: sounds like you want to do dongerParts[val] = data
[14:03:48] <doug64k> cohitre: there is no 'val' variable
[14:03:59] <MarioD> val is the item from the array
[14:04:00] <cohitre> and you also may want to use $.each(array) instead of $(array).each
[14:04:36] <doug64k> MarioD: there is no count variable either
[14:04:57] <MarioD> how come when I console log count and val they output correctly?
[14:05:35] <MarioD> count gives me the position in the array, and val gives me the item from the array
[14:05:51] <doug64k> ah, ok. missed that
[14:06:15] <doug64k> MarioD: as I said, I have no idea what 'data' is
[14:06:26] <doug64k> therefore it is impossible to say what to do
[14:06:31] <MarioD> data is the json file I'm pulling
[14:06:44] <doug64k> it has properties with the names from that array?
[14:07:25] <MarioD> so I created an object, I'm grabbing json files and mapping them into the object I created
[14:07:56] <doug64k> MarioD: still no idea what properties data has
[14:08:20] <doug64k> MarioD: I know it seems obvious to you
[14:08:29] <MarioD> does it matter in this case? what if data is just {"test": "test"}
[14:09:00] <doug64k> ok, and you want dongerParts.test = "test" to happen?
[14:09:47] <MarioD> I want to create a new object within dongerParts and throw the items form that json file into that object
[14:10:02] <MarioD> so the array is the list of objects I want to create within dongerParts
[14:10:05] <doug64k> MarioD: $.extend(dongerParts, data)
[14:10:39] <doug64k> MarioD: that will make a property in dongerParts for each property in data, copying the value from the property in data
[14:11:06] <MarioD> the thing is there's 6 json files, each having the same structure
[14:11:19] <MarioD> I want them to map to seperate objects, 'arms', 'body'
[14:11:27] <MarioD> within dongerParts
[14:11:38] <doug64k> MarioD: ah, so you are doing 6 requests. got it...
[14:11:41] <doug64k> 7*
[14:12:05] <MarioD> yeah, that's why I run through the each, just having an issue with the .val
[14:12:17] <MarioD> it's actually creating an object called val
[14:12:20] <doug64k> oh crap, cohitre was right you do want dongerParts[val] = data
[14:12:23] <MarioD> instead of 'arms' etc
[14:13:20] <MarioD> ah that makes sense
[14:13:27] <doug64k> MarioD: and I agree with him on the other thing too: use $.each(dongerItems, function(...
[14:13:56] <MarioD> kk, how come?
[14:13:58] <doug64k> MarioD: right now you make a weird jquery object that doesn't have elements and iterate it
[14:15:07] <MarioD> k I will switch it up, thanks for the help :) looks like I still have tons of learning to do :-P
[14:18:43] <doug64k> MarioD: $(<array>) means, "make a jquery object that has the elements from array". nothing enforces that they are DOM elements but it is strange to do that in this case. $.each is a thing that iterates an array like or own properties
[14:19:28] <MarioD> got it thanks, also quick question - the reason I'm doing this is so that it's easier to run through the json files
[14:19:33] <MarioD> by copying them to a local variable
[14:19:54] <MarioD> because I noticed things act funny when you're doing all within the success function of the ajax call
[14:20:02] <MarioD> is this the correct way do it?
[14:20:46] <doug64k> MarioD: do you need a way to wait for them all to finish?
[14:20:48] <tharkun> robertmaxrees: Ajax and assigning a pair of functions to a pair fo buttons on the web app is all my job on the UI I leave the rest to those that know about it. Although I might keep on researching js and jquery for personal projects but I'm too overwhelmed by $DAYJOB
[14:21:57] <MarioD> kind of, I run a bunch of functions on the results to sort them, arrange them etc when the user click a button
[14:22:41] <doug64k> MarioD: the way you do it creates huge problems if something else needs to know when they are ready to read
[14:23:37] <MarioD> won't they just be ready once the page is done loading?
[14:23:43] <cjohnson> nettoweb_: depends what you are trying to accomplish
[14:23:57] <MarioD> I'm goign to run a few functions ont eh results once a user clicks a button
[14:24:20] <MarioD> http://dongerlist.com/create-donger
[14:24:26] <MarioD> if you go there I can explain
[14:24:46] <MarioD> So the items on the bottom get loaded in from json files
[14:24:48] <nettoweb_> cjohnson I have a form but isnt create anything, so its not linked with a model.
[14:25:14] <MarioD> then I will have a random button: once a user clicks the random button it will grab elements from each one of those json files and create a random "emoticon"
[14:26:08] <joker_89> Ii have a menu using jquery and when i click hover the select box then show a div box overlaped of my select box. It works ok but with I.Explorer it hides unless i have the mouse presssed all time
[14:40:06] <MarioD> Is there a way to store a random number inside of a variable but have it be random every time it's called?
[14:40:24] <MarioD> doing var randomNumber = 1 + Math.floor(Math.random() * arrayCount); will always return the same number because you're stting the variable
[14:41:10] <vol4ko> never use math.floor
[14:41:25] <duckxx> jQuery(".button1 OR .button2").fadeToggle("fast",   --- How do i add in a OR statement to make this execute in do different elements?
[14:42:17] <MarioD> vol4ko, how come?
[14:43:37] <MarioD> jQuery(".button1, .button2").fadeToggle("fast"
[14:43:40] <doug64k> duckxx: comma
[14:44:01] <duckxx> oh thanks! tat was easy.. its not something u can easily google neither
[14:44:24] <MarioD> http://api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/
[14:47:29] <doug64k> duckxx: if both exist, it selects both. if you want one or the other but prefer one, put the preferred one first and do $('.button1, .button2').eq(0)
[14:48:43] <Jacta> Can anyone help me with bootstrapvalidator? http://jsfiddle.net/61z0v3zz/ - Try to write horse in first field and cow in second - when the error message apeears, erase the text and write horse so they have same content - then I keep getting Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'group' of undefined
[14:54:00] <doug64k> MarioD: write a function to get a random number
[14:55:19] <doug64k> MarioD: function rand(min,max) { return Math.random() * (max-min) + min; }. returns number such that min <= value < max
[14:56:30] <tharkun> I've seen a lot of code beeing written in javascript. Where can a sane line be drawn where some parts of the functionality of a system is given by the server and some given by the interaction of the user/web-browser?
[14:57:12] <tharkun> I'm used to the MVC model of development. Where the view is kept as simple and straight forward as possible.
[14:57:14] <doug64k> tharkun: server side deals with raw data, browser side does user visuals and user input
[14:57:50] <doug64k> it's a nice architecture regardless of whether it is on a webserver or not
[14:58:50] <MarioD> doug that worked thanks, another question - if you use math.floor you never get 10 in a 1-10 but if you use ceil you never get 1, is there a way around this?
[14:58:58] <doug64k> the same raw data backend can serve any number of frontends, like browsers, some binary shared object for C guys, some obscure handheld device, smartphone app, etc
[14:59:36] <MarioD> math.round got it :-P
[15:00:09] <tharkun> doug64k: Thanks.
[15:00:18] <doug64k> vol4ko: why not use floor?
[15:00:34] <MarioD> floor seems like it never hits 10 in a 1-10
[15:00:50] <doug64k> MarioD: with my function that is expected
[15:01:06] <doug64k> math.random returns a number from 0.00000 to 0.99999999...
[15:02:39] <doug64k> MarioD: Math.random docs on MDN: The Math.random() function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range [0, 1) that is, from 0 (inclusive) up to but not including 1 (exclusive)
[15:02:55] <MarioD> ah ok
[15:03:53] <MarioD> I changed it to function rand() { return Math.floor(Math.random() * arrayCount); }
[15:06:29] <doug64k> MarioD: make it take the array as a parameter? function randomArrayElement(arr) { return arr.length ? arr[0|(Math.random()*arr.length)] : undefined; }
[15:09:54] <duckxx> @doug64k hmm.. the multiple selector isn't working. the first selector works, but the second doesn't work to turn toggle it off.. im basically making a overlay and when clicking on either button it should toggle each other.. my js: http://prntscr.com/5343te ---
[15:15:15] <doug64k> duckxx: in your code, right before that line, put: console.log($('.block-views-drop... dude why is it a screenshot
[15:15:30] <doug64k> jsfiddle plz
[15:16:30] <doug64k> anyway console.log those two things before/after the comma, what does it output?
[15:18:13] <doug64k> I wish I could solve it and send you a screenshot of the working code :D
[15:18:45] <acidjazz> lolllllllllllllll
[15:18:47] <acidjazz> this screne shot
[15:18:57] <acidjazz> who screen shots code
[15:20:58] <robertmaxrees> you'd be surprised.
[15:27:00] <Robdgreat> it's obviously the most useful way to transmit text
[15:27:12] <MarioD> lol
[15:27:17] <tw2113> the SEOs is terrific
[15:27:31] <TheWhiteOx> Anybody know a good glowing/pulsating text effect script?
[15:28:18] <acidjazz> lol tw2113
[15:28:28] <acidjazz> speaking of images/text
[15:28:30] <acidjazz> sort of off topic
[15:28:33] <acidjazz> but this is awesome
[15:28:33] <acidjazz> http://natmchugh.blogspot.com/2014/10/how-i-created-two-images-with-same-md5.html
[15:28:41] <acidjazz> kinda old in the security industry.. but really neat
[15:31:08] <doug64k> hey I just realized a good solution to cursor-navigating a table: work based on the pixel offset of the cell in the row. table reflow behavior will guarantee that cell positions are comparable
[15:31:38] <doug64k> if done relative to their tr's
[15:32:26] <tharkun> robertmaxrees: my two little functions and the little ajax I managed to retrieve from the server got me into trouble.
[15:32:38] <Robdgreat> oh no
[15:32:49] <tharkun> Customer wants a nice looking and graphical interface. You are responsible for it.
[15:33:22] <doug64k> going to update my fiddle to linuson (who is offline) to try it
[15:33:38] * tharkun thanks robertmaxrees and wishes good luck for him.
[15:34:46] <MarioD> What's the best way to select a random object from an array based off of one of the values? Figure out which ones have that value, put them in a temp object then select a random one?
[15:35:13] <MarioD> if(value.orientation == 'left'){
[15:35:13] <MarioD>    console.log('test');
[15:35:13] <MarioD> }
[15:35:41] <MarioD> so I want to pick a random option from the ones that returned true to containing "left"
[15:35:47] <robertmaxrees> don't multiline paste please :(
[15:35:57] <MarioD> ah sorry
[15:36:29] <robertmaxrees> could you fiddle up what you're looking for?
[15:36:35] <MarioD> sure thing, 1 sec
[15:38:51] <doug64k> MarioD: you mean, pick a random one, excluding some specific one?
[15:38:52] <MarioD> http://jsfiddle.net/e9x92f9c/
[15:39:13] <MarioD> pick a random one where the key value pair equals ssomething specific
[15:39:36] <MarioD> so find the ones where orientation == left, then pick a random one from the results
[15:39:59] <MarioD> do I have to store all the results somewhere first, before grabbing a random one?
[15:40:00] <robertmaxrees> temp array of all of the ones that contain left, then pick from there.
[15:40:10] <MarioD> ah ok that's what I figured
[15:40:10] <robertmaxrees> th3fallen what's going on now?
[15:40:18] <MarioD> thanks Robert
[15:40:40] <robertmaxrees> err, woops.  meant tharkun
[15:44:50] <doug64k> MarioD: if you use my function from earlier: randomArrayElement(someArray.filter(function(v) { return v.something === somevalue; })
[15:45:04] <doug64k> )
[15:46:22] <MarioD> thanks doug, yeah I think I got it now - it's crazy how repetitive things can be in javascript
[15:46:25] <doug64k> returns a random element from the set of elements selected by the filter callback
[15:46:56] <robertmaxrees> return from a return yo.
[15:47:12] <robertmaxrees> passin' objects like a real g
[15:47:45] <MarioD> lol
[15:50:35] <doug64k> MarioD: it is all trivial to refactor. you could make a property matcher in a function and pass the return of that to filter, or you could refactor to filter an array by one property === one value, and call that. it returns a function that does the match
[15:51:44] <doug64k> function propertyMatcher(propname, propval) { return function(v) { return v[propname] === propval; }; }
[15:52:15] <MarioD> do you usually create functions for everything? even on smaller projects?
[15:52:24] <doug64k> then it could be randomArrayElement(someArray.filter(propertyMatcher('something', somevalue)))
[15:52:31] <MarioD> I guess it's just good practise?
[15:53:41] <doug64k> MarioD: if you find yourself repeating yourself, you refactor out the repetition. you don't just go rampaging through functioning everything :D
[15:53:53] <robertmaxrees> depends on the case.
[15:54:00] <MarioD> haha right
[15:54:00] <robertmaxrees> i like giving semi-complex logic a name.
[15:54:15] <robertmaxrees> because that name can help me/somebody else down the road know wtf is going on.
[15:54:50] <MarioD> right, I will probably be that someone wondering what I wrote a week from now :-P
[15:54:56] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[15:55:10] <robertmaxrees> also helps encourage modularity imo.
[15:55:43] <robertmaxrees> lately i've been favoring writing code where each logical step is a function and that those functions assume as little as possible.
[15:55:54] <robertmaxrees> so I'm passing things in/out as explicitly as possible.
[15:56:03] <robertmaxrees> just have to be careful that you don't take that too far.
[15:56:28] <MarioD> when I first learned functions I started doing that and it got sooo confusing :-P
[15:56:35] <MarioD> I had functions within functions, 10 levels deep lol
[15:56:39] <robertmaxrees> :(
[15:56:41] <MarioD> became a disaster lol
[15:56:44] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[15:56:46] <robertmaxrees> lesson learned ;)
[15:57:12] <MarioD> they were just so cool I couldn't help myself :-P
[15:57:19] <robertmaxrees> they're a helluva drug
[15:57:47] <MarioD> k new question, $.each() is there a easy way to do a callback once the loop is done? or do you have to count then throw an if statement when it reaches the end?
[15:58:00] <robertmaxrees> put it after the $.each() call.
[15:58:04] <robertmaxrees> it's not async
[15:58:34] <MarioD> ah ok, so the function after it won't run till it's done?
[15:58:38] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:58:48] <MarioD> right, got it
[16:06:35] <MarioD> Question: When I set the value of a text area like so: $('.donger-board').val(finalValue); for some reason the text area is no selectable or clickable. If I inspect the element the value is not actually within the text area.
[16:13:17] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7cp75juq/ MarioD
[16:13:18] <robertmaxrees> no clue
[16:13:52] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7cp75juq/1/ works fine from here.
[16:14:42] <MarioD> yeah it's weird I have it in one function and it works fine - but in another where the value comes from a json file - it puts the value int eh textarea just fine
[16:14:46] <MarioD> but it's not selectable
[16:14:53] <robertmaxrees> what's the value?
[16:15:11] <sacho_> MarioD, make an example
[16:15:12] <MarioD> but eh time I put it into val() just a string
[16:15:16] <sacho_> like robret did
[16:15:25] <MarioD> sacho, kk
[16:18:07] <MarioD> gah figured it out - had something to prevent selection when clicking multiple times on a button quickly
[16:18:12] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[16:19:17] <MarioD> this irc chat is amazing, it's like I'm in an office with 3424 javascript experts sitting around me :-P
[16:19:27] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[16:19:48] <robertmaxrees> 9/10 times you just need a rubber duck.
[16:19:54] <MarioD> LOL
[16:20:22] <MarioD> it's so much nicer than posting a question on stack overflow and waiting 5 days only to not get a response
[16:20:35] <robertmaxrees> haha
[16:20:51] <MarioD> by then I'm already bored of what I was working on :-P
[16:33:30] <vinex08> hi, i do have an image with position fixed in my home,,, and i want it to fade out in a certain amount of minutes/seconds.. maybe line 10 seconds after it loads. i have no idea about the code ..but i know jquery can do that... what's the code that does that?
[16:34:11] <MarioD> You could use setTimeout() http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp
[16:34:15] <robertmaxrees> bind to the image's load event and use setTimeout()

[16:34:30] <robertmaxrees> no w3schools ;(
[16:34:43] <MarioD> haha kk, still learning how to help :-P
[16:34:50] <robertmaxrees> MDN is better.
[16:35:01] <robertmaxrees> http://www.w3fools.com/
[16:35:16] <MarioD> damn google, always steers me to the wrong site :-P
[16:40:50] <MarioD> http://jsfiddle.net/o5ensscx/
[16:41:30] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:41:38] <robertmaxrees> your code doesn't make sense.
[16:41:48] <MarioD> lol, let me try to explain
[16:42:11] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to access properties dynamically?
[16:42:21] <vinex08> Thanks guys
[16:42:21] <MarioD> yeah
[16:42:31] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/o5ensscx/1/
[16:42:35] <MarioD> I'm trying to make a function out of it :-P
[16:42:43] <robertmaxrees> literally no reason to do that.
[16:42:54] <robertmaxrees> but you want object[variableWithString]
[16:42:56] <MarioD> cause I'm going to be doing the same thing 5 times
[16:43:11] <MarioD> unless I just throw it into an each?
[16:43:14] <yurakeshi> MarioD shouldn't it be randomPart(blah.blorg)?
[16:43:34] <MarioD> blah will be static in this case
[16:43:46] <MarioD> but I guess it's probably better to specify it there anyways
[16:44:35] <MarioD> Those darn square brackets keep coming back to haunt me. Do you guys know any good tutorials that walk you through them?
[16:44:36] <robertmaxrees> MarioD http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/akusejfq/
[16:44:42] <yurakeshi> MarioD, this should work http://jsfiddle.net/o5ensscx/2/
[16:44:59] <robertmaxrees> MarioD look at what I sent you.
[16:45:16] <robertmaxrees> long story short, object['propName']; is the same as object.propName;
[16:45:54] <robertmaxrees> you can pass variables/functions to the square brackets - those will evaluate to get whatever return value they have and then use that value to get the property name.  the fiddle i pasted illustrates this.
[16:46:24] <MarioD> ah there we go
[16:46:35] <robertmaxrees> what make sense?
[16:46:42] <MarioD> I watched just about every tutorial on json and nobody mentioned that anywhere in there
[16:46:51] <MarioD> [] brackets
[16:46:51] <robertmaxrees> you didn't want JSON.
[16:46:54] <robertmaxrees> JSON is not JavaScript.
[16:47:37] <MarioD> the videos I watched were about navigation objects & arrays, using a json file
[16:47:44] <MarioD> none of them used the square brackets in any of the examples
[16:47:59] <MarioD> using jquery
[16:48:00] <robertmaxrees> well now you know :)
[16:48:11] <MarioD> damn that clears up so much, thanks guys! :D
[16:48:37] <yurakeshi> robertmaxrees, how would you go about to get something similar to get deep properties by name. The easy way don't work: object['level1.level2.level3']
[16:49:06] <robertmaxrees> object['level1']['level2']['level3']
[16:49:39] <yurakeshi> so, considering that the name would be dynamic, the only solution is spliting and lopping?
[16:49:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:49:49] <robertmaxrees> i'm not looping there.
[16:50:02] <robertmaxrees> what exactly are you trying to do?
[16:50:20] <yurakeshi> one moment
[16:56:56] <yurakeshi> robertmaxrees, is this the best way of doing it? http://jsfiddle.net/3v8zbxs6/1/
[16:57:43] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do it that way personally.
[16:58:12] <yurakeshi> how would you?
[16:58:16] <robertmaxrees> why are you building a wrapper for accessing object properties?
[16:59:02] <MarioD> Is there a reason why you guys put your functions into variables?
[16:59:26] <yurakeshi> For filling and serializing html forms and lists based only on they attributes.
[16:59:54] <MarioD> instead of just doing function showProp(){}
[17:00:25] <robertmaxrees> MarioD scopign, readabiluty
[17:00:49] <Robdgreat> that's something I suspect a lot of people don't know and might not have ever bothered asking
[17:00:49] <robertmaxrees> yurakeshi that doesn't make any sense/.
[17:01:11] <robertmaxrees> it also helps highlight that functions are objects, like anything else.
[17:03:26] <MarioD> right, on my list of things to do more research on
[17:03:47] <yurakeshi> robertmaxrees, take a CRUD page using 100% AJAX for example, you need a function to get the values from your html inputs and hold it as as JS object(serializing) and to fill the form(for viewing or updating) you need a function to set the input values that came into the AJAX Response. So, if my input name is the same of my object property, I can do it dinamically.
[17:04:05] <robertmaxrees> yurakeshi that sounds like you're munging things together imo.
[17:04:43] <robertmaxrees> and at that point, you need something like backbone or riot to manage all of that for you.
[17:04:55] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're overcomplicating it.
[17:05:16] <yurakeshi> robertmaxrees, i don't know any of thoses, but i already have it all working
[17:05:39] <yurakeshi> My problem is only when passing deep properties.
[17:06:03] <robertmaxrees> what are you asking then?
[17:06:13] <sacho_> huh?
[17:06:14] <yurakeshi> It's not actually a problem, I use something similar as what you showed you.
[17:06:23] <robertmaxrees> i'm really lost.
[17:06:24] <yurakeshi> I only wanted to see if there's a better option ^^
[17:06:27] <robertmaxrees> there are.\
[17:06:29] <robertmaxrees> many.
[17:06:43] <robertmaxrees> when i mentioned them, you said your already have something that works.
[17:07:01] <sacho_> yurakeshi, usually the solution is to not have that specific problem in the first place
[17:07:05] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:07:49] <robertmaxrees> it's like my argument about switch statements - I'm not saying that I favor if/else instead of switch, it's that I favor refactoring so you don't have the problem in the first place.
[17:07:52] <sacho_> yurakeshi, why are you comparing indexOf's with 1?
[17:09:10] <sacho_> yurakeshi, otherwise, *if you have that problem*, that's a fair solution
[17:09:24] <MarioD> What's the best way to check if a parameter is set on a function? http://stackoverflow.com/a/14079062/2040509 is that a good way to go about it?
[17:09:26] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, fix the actual problem ;)
[17:09:32] <yurakeshi> robertmaxrees, what I have that work it's all the infra, from the database, to model, to service to interface... i was only asking an opnion about that function
[17:09:48] <robertmaxrees> yurakeshi "the infra"?
[17:09:56] <robertmaxrees> MarioD basically.
[17:10:07] <MarioD> thanks robert
[17:10:15] <robertmaxrees> lots of different ways to do that one.
[17:10:51] <MarioD> is there a preferred method?
[17:11:09] <yurakeshi> sacho_ i use indexOf('.') < 1 so I know that there's no '.' in the string
[17:11:15] <robertmaxrees> are you working as apart of a team, MarioD?
[17:11:20] <robertmaxrees> yurakeshi you need to check < -1
[17:11:25] <robertmaxrees> err, > -1
[17:11:39] <robertmaxrees> indexOf() treats the string as an array, which are 0 index.
[17:11:41] <sacho_> yurakeshi, indexOf() returns -1 if the search string isn't found
[17:11:51] <MarioD> rober, nope - this is just a small side thing I'm using to get a better understanding of jquery
[17:11:55] <robertmaxrees> so if you had a period as the first character, it'll be at 0
[17:12:07] <sacho_> yurakeshi, it's just a nitpick - but I think it's clearer if you compare to -1
[17:12:16] <robertmaxrees> it's not just a nitpick
[17:12:30] <sacho_> e.g. you don't have to stop and think "wait, why would matching the dot at 0 be valid?"
[17:12:44] <robertmaxrees> the previous code has a bug if you put a dot at the first or second positions ;)
[17:13:18] <robertmaxrees> MarioD the other way to handle those is pass around objects instead.
[17:13:53] <robertmaxrees> that way things like order and whatnot matter less.
[17:14:01] <robertmaxrees> then you're checking if properties are undefined.
[17:14:08] <MarioD> ah interesting
[17:14:24] <yurakeshi> robertmaxrees, sacho_, you guys are right about the indexOf(), but slow down, was just an example ^^
[17:16:15] <sacho_> yurakeshi, http://jsfiddle.net/aegbgu19/
[17:16:23] <MarioD> @robertmaxrees have never seen anybody do that before, will give it a shot, thanks
[17:17:53] <robertmaxrees> yurakeshi you wanted advice and info.  hard for us to "know what you meant"
[17:17:58] <robertmaxrees> we're going off what you're giving us ;)
[17:19:02] <yurakeshi> robertmaxrees, sorry mate
[17:19:50] <yurakeshi> i got a little surprised thats all... I was expecting an opnion about the function, not reasons to not use it =P
[17:21:56] <MarioD> robertmaxrees: are there any downsides to using an object as a property in a function?
[17:22:12] <robertmaxrees> you mean other than the fact that you're already using objects? ;)
[17:22:25] <robertmaxrees> but seriously, only the extra cognitive overhead.
[17:22:43] <robertmaxrees> if you're dealing with like 2 or 3 parameters, i wouldn't do it that way.
[17:23:23] <MarioD> but it gives so much context to the properties :-P
[17:23:36] <robertmaxrees> nah not really.
[17:23:53] <robertmaxrees> unless you mean when you're calling it.
[17:23:59] <MarioD> randomPart({part: "arms", orientation: "left"});
[17:24:30] <MarioD> better than randomPart("arms", "left"); ?
[17:24:38] <robertmaxrees> var part = 'arms', orientation = 'left'; randomPart(part, orientation);
[17:24:44] <yurakeshi> robertmaxrees, no no, it's not for few properties. It's a function to fill and serialize all the forms and list in an application. Close to 100 I think
[17:25:00] <robertmaxrees> yurakeshi i was talking with MarioD.
[17:25:15] <yurakeshi> sorry =x
[17:25:25] <robertmaxrees> yurakeshi but i still don't think what you're doing isa good idea.
[17:28:02] <yurakeshi> robertmaxrees, putting in another view... is there another way to create an object and set all it values (considering nested objects) based only on the HTML markup? I mean, without specific code for each form.
[17:28:25] <robertmaxrees> totally depends on the case/.
[17:29:02] <robertmaxrees> the nesting is where i get lost.
[17:29:14] <robertmaxrees> forms are key/value pairs.  treat them that way imo.
[17:29:38] <yurakeshi> Take an Customer Form for example. You have the customer name and basic info (flat) then you can have an array for phone numbers (which are objects with DDI, DDD and Number) and then you have an e-mail array. So you're object structure should be { Name: 'X', Phones: [...], Emails: [...] }
[17:30:57] <robertmaxrees> still key/value imo.
[17:31:03] <robertmaxrees> i split that server side once it gets there.
[17:31:49] <yurakeshi> but the server side recieves only one object that has Phones and Emails property
[17:32:12] <robertmaxrees> right, and then i parse through it as appropriate.
[17:33:08] <robertmaxrees> basically, offset the hard part to your server.
[17:34:18] <abak> Hi all, I have a form containing several text input fields, what would be the better way to make them mutually exclusive ?
[17:34:44] <yurakeshi> the bottom line, for me, is that I want an architecture that if I need to add one more field to the form, I just have to do it on the HTML and on the Model. So I need an dynamic JS controller
[17:35:13] <robertmaxrees> yurakeshi http://api.jquery.com/serializearray/
[17:35:23] <robertmaxrees> there's your dynamic js controller.
[17:36:15] <robertmaxrees> imo you're doing WAY too much in your JS
[17:41:42] <yurakeshi> robertmaxrees, yeah, I sometimes overuse javascript... here's my current serializeForm function: http://pastebin.com/jMcH12QW
[17:42:35] <yurakeshi> and here's the fillForm:
[17:42:35] <yurakeshi>     fillForm: function (object) {
[17:42:35] <yurakeshi>         var $inputs = $(this).find("input[type=hidden], input[type=text], input[type=color], input[type=checkbox], textarea, select");
[17:42:35] <yurakeshi>         var len = $inputs.length;
[17:42:35] <yurakeshi>         for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) {
[17:42:56] <yurakeshi> sorry =x
[17:43:06] <yurakeshi> here's the fillForm: http://pastebin.com/VA3ejJ9Q
[17:50:54] <robertmaxrees> aaaah noooo
[17:51:00] <robertmaxrees> don't serialize.
[17:51:10] <robertmaxrees> use .serializeArray() and play with data server0sude
[17:51:14] <robertmaxrees> *server-side
[17:51:52] <yurakeshi> robertmaxrees, why?
[18:01:21] <yurakeshi> i'm intrigued =x
[18:11:21] <doug64k> yurakeshi: I prefer to design it so the designer puts certain attributes on templates and within the templates attributes to specify properties. it is a simple data binding implementation. If a certain field needed a certain validation, an attribute would have a name that looks up the validator function, so all validation everywhere is handled in one place
[18:12:39] <doug64k> that way the js knows little or nothing about the page, yet interprets all the attributes and makes it all work
[18:13:24] <doug64k> which gives you and or your designer freedom to change the html without having to re-debug everything
[18:18:02] <yurakeshi> doug64k, i think my design is similiar. But I also have generic validators on the JS, so it can guide the user fast interaction.
[18:19:04] <andrew9183> Is there a way to maintain events when replacing content with $(“body”).html() ?
[18:19:27] <doug64k> andrew9183: yes, don't do that, properly modify those child nodes
[18:19:28] <yurakeshi> on top of serializeForm and serializeList I have some generic controls that handle the user interaction and communicates with the server
[18:19:56] <doug64k> andrew9183: another way is not to have listeners on the elements and use event delegation and listen on a parent that remains in existence
[18:20:05] <andrew9183> doug64k: i need to search the dom for some text and then add a wrapper class to them.
[18:20:40] <andrew9183> doug64k: that’s true, but i’m using bootstraps data-spy tags to trigger
[18:21:18] <doug64k> andrew9183: then do it properly, remove that node, insert the wrapper where that node was, then append the original node as a child to your wrapper - result: no destruction and recreation of all the children
[18:21:39] <doug64k> andrew9183: jquery has a .detach() that can preserve event handlers
[18:21:46] <doug64k> it also has wrapWith that does that
[18:22:00] <andrew9183> but that node is just plain text
[18:22:08] <andrew9183> or would i remove the whole text node and replace it and attach it again ?
[18:22:14] <doug64k> sorry, wrap: http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[18:23:05] <andrew9183> ah gotcha
[18:24:41] <yurakeshi> doug64k, this is what an default page is like for me: http://pastebin.com/x2LSYbfS
[18:24:46] <yurakeshi> what do you think?
[18:25:39] <yurakeshi> i'm trying to achive custom default functionalities in libs and also letting the end programmer change it or built upon it
[18:26:27] <yurakeshi> i know it's still ugly, but i want to improve it
[18:28:47] <doug64k> I basically build most things as if it is a plugin, with any application specifics being passed in as data. Each template or data binding has suggested data-attribute selectors as defaults, which could be overridden to anything. the code uses symbolic selector names everywhere, pulling from the "options" if you know what I mean
[18:29:50] <doug64k> so for example, it might have rowTemplateSelector: 'div[data-template=billToForm]'
[18:30:03] <doug64k> which either means, use that selector, or override it there if you want to use something else
[18:30:38] <andrew9183> yeah I guess I am too lazy to go search and wrap those respective texts
[18:30:49] <doug64k> it might be more generic and just look for div[data-template], letting the value of the attribute choose something
[18:32:50] <yurakeshi> doug64k, i think you mean something like this? http://pastebin.com/xNtby3Q2
[18:33:10] <yurakeshi> sorry about the comments, but my employer is here in Brazil ^^
[18:33:52] <doug64k> yurakeshi: nice looks good
[18:35:21] <yurakeshi> thanks
[18:35:31] <doug64k> then making a ui is more like making a config file, matching up names expected by the REST backend with attributes that annotate the binding of that input to that property
[19:23:33] <Mark__> does anybody have an idea why this countdown clock has 00000000 at the end? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/request
[19:28:00] <MarioD> It looks like you have the countdown there twice, if you inspect element you can see the zeros are actually days, hours, minutes, seconds
[19:28:23] <MarioD> so whatever is generating the digits is doing ti 2 times
[19:40:22] <doug64k> Mark__: what 0000?
[19:41:08] <Mark__> nvm, i fixe it thanks.
[19:51:43] <Mark__> laggy.
[21:16:18] * CssNoob good afternoon y'all
[21:16:38] <Uhkis> good morning
[21:51:55] <RudyValencia> Hi, I'm trying to make a rule where an li in a menu clicks the a inside it, how do I do that?
[21:52:14] <RudyValencia> *an li clicked in a menu clicks the a inside it
[22:23:42] <doug64k> RudyValencia: $(my_li).find('a').trigger('click')
[22:26:33] <Uhkis> why not make the a's the size of li's as usual?
[22:28:00] <RudyValencia> Because I want some items to have an external link icon provided by a fontawesome <i> tag
[22:29:01] <doug64k> RudyValencia: why not just put the click handler on the li and it will get the click from the a anyway because of event bubbling
[22:29:24] <doug64k> RudyValencia: or better yet, one handler on the ul
[22:30:06] <RudyValencia> What I'm trying to do is have it so that the user can click anywhere on the menu item, not just the a inside :)
[22:30:38] <doug64k> RudyValencia: then put the event listener further up the hierarchy - at the li is easiest
[22:30:53] <doug64k> RudyValencia: if you do that, then the li will get a click event even if they click the anchor
[22:31:52] <doug64k> RudyValencia: you know about event bubbling right?
[22:32:15] <doug64k> the event will "bubble up" from the anchor and reach the li in all cases
[22:32:20] <RudyValencia> I have $("ul.submenu li").click(function(object) { $(object).find("a").trigger("click"); });
[22:32:39] <doug64k> RudyValencia: wrong
[22:33:20] <doug64k> don't do what I said earlier, that was my answer to your XY question
[22:33:43] <doug64k> listen for the click on the li and the a clicks will work automatically
[22:33:46] <doug64k> don't believe it?
[22:34:41] <doug64k> RudyValencia: ah wait though, those anchors have real hrefs and you want a page load to occur?
[22:35:25] <doug64k> RudyValencia: ok, then that should work. it works right
[22:35:45] <doug64k> ?
[22:36:25] <RudyValencia> It doesn't.
[22:37:02] <RudyValencia> I get "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function".
[22:37:36] <doug64k> RudyValencia: don't name that parameter 'object', it is an event object. your code is wrong..  1 sec
[22:39:09] <doug64k> $("ul.submenu li").on('click', function(event) { $('a', this).trigger("click"); });
[22:40:11] <doug64k> $('a', this) is the same as $(this).find('a') but requires one less jquery wrapper to be constructed
[22:41:46] <doug64k> RudyValencia: $(object) is nonsense because what you think is an "object" is the event object, not a DOM element
[22:42:10] <RudyValencia> I get a jquery error with that code you just posted
[22:42:21] <doug64k> so you are saying, make a jquery with one "element" that is this event object, then find stuff that are children... makes no sense
[22:42:47] <doug64k> RudyValencia: care to share the error message?
[22:43:10] <RudyValencia> It just says <error> and references line 4377 in jquery.js
[22:44:03] <RudyValencia> Could it be that jQuery is conflicting with enyojs?
[22:44:16] <doug64k> no, can you paste your actual code?
[22:44:31] <doug64k> jquery works at all right?
[22:45:05] <RudyValencia> yes, it does work for shwing/hiding the submenu ul. and I have an example up at http://gxy.psiglenmere.com/hpprx.html
[22:45:18] <RudyValencia> (you'll need to resize to < 768px to see it)
[22:48:21] <doug64k> RudyValencia: I see what is happening, app.js is throwing "Too much recursion" errors
[22:48:34] <doug64k> Internal Error: too much recursion.
[22:48:39] <doug64k> it is a stack overflow basically
[22:49:13] <doug64k> RudyValencia: errors are not ok, it causes the browser to abandon what it was doing and stop the script dead
[22:49:35] <RudyValencia> Something in enyo's app.js is wrong then.
[22:49:54] <doug64k> I checked my code, it finds the 'a' tag - then app.js kills the js engine before the click can work
[22:49:56] <RudyValencia> I'll need to take it up with them.
[22:50:13] <doug64k> RudyValencia: I would
[22:53:33] <doug64k> RudyValencia: LOL!
[22:53:36] <doug64k> I know what is happening
[22:53:53] <RudyValencia> what? :)
[22:54:27] <doug64k> ok you know about event bubbling right? well, what do you think happens when you trigger click on the 'a'? it bubbles up and the li fires another click on the 'a', until it blows up
[22:55:20] <robert_> doug64k: e.preventDefault() would work there, right?
[22:55:31] <doug64k> e.stopPropagation()
[22:55:41] <doug64k> but, that would have to be on the 'a' itself
[22:55:50] <doug64k> RudyValencia: why click the 'a'? to go to the link?
[22:55:59] <RudyValencia> yes
[22:56:11] <doug64k> RudyValencia: then let's do that ok? XY question again :D
[22:56:31] <RudyValencia> I need a way to handle menu items with an external link mark like the one there
[22:56:35] <doug64k> location.href = $('a', this).prop('href');
[22:57:08] <doug64k> instead of that trigger stuff
[22:57:58] <robert_> doug64k: so we fake it with e.stopPropagation() + location.href?
[22:58:27] <doug64k> robert_: no need to stopPropagation anymore, it just fetches the url from the a tag's href and goes there
[22:58:56] <doug64k> stopping propagation would require an event handler on each 'a' element - not necessary
[22:59:58] <robert_> so this is weird
[23:00:27] <doug64k> RudyValencia:  $("ul.submenu li").on('click', function(event) { location.href = $('a', this).prop('href'); });
[23:00:28] <robert_> the mouseover link text for a brief moment, is "woodforest.comhttps://www.woodforest.com"
[23:00:41] <robert_> or something similar
[23:01:11] <robert_> doug64k: chrome bug?
[23:01:49] <doug64k> robert_: sounds more like a bug in the site - itmight mess with the href
[23:02:41] <doug64k> robert_: or a chrome bug - never doubt that possibility, it's not super stable
[23:02:55] <doug64k> calling DOM methods wrong crashes whole tabs

[23:54:19] <rubyonrailed> Does anyone know of a plugin that allows users to edit text by just clicking the text and typing.  No textbox
[23:55:38] <torbjorn> i happen to have just created that functionality, but not a plugin as such, but its quite straight forward, need to give the element the attribute contentEditable
[23:56:01] <torbjorn> and then for example on .blur you can unset that attribute
[23:58:24] <rubyonrailed> sounds cool, do you have a example?
