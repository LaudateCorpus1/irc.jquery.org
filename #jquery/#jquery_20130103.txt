[00:02:50] <relipse> ok true that
[00:02:52] <relipse> more ss
[00:04:02] <xjjk> relipse: also, is it that silly?
[00:04:11] <xjjk> letting your user use your app without requiring login
[00:04:15] <xjjk> until they want to save
[00:04:18] <xjjk> isn't that insane
[00:04:38] <xjjk> very progressive IMHO
[00:09:27] <Whiskey> How can you make two divs have the exactly same size whit jquery?
[00:10:27] <monk3y> Uh.  Give them both the same class, then $('.class').css('width', val) etc.
[00:10:30] <monk3y> I think.
[00:10:35] <xjjk> Whiskey: you should really use CSS for that
[00:10:40] <xjjk> but yeah, what monk3y said
[00:10:56] <Whiskey> xjjk hahaha :)
[00:10:59] <monk3y> Yeah I was going to ask if you were doing it dynamically/based on user input/movements etc .. or if it's just static/from render.
[00:11:02] <Whiskey> Do you mind if i PM you?
[00:11:12] <monk3y> I don't mind if you PM xjjk.
[00:11:15] <xjjk> better to discuss in channel
[00:11:17] <xjjk> please
[00:11:22] <Whiskey> kk okay
[00:11:32] <monk3y> Yeah, all you're giving me is floods of ASL.
[00:11:38] <monk3y> I've never written anything in that.
[00:11:45] <Whiskey> http://tinkerbin.com/GG4Lb1FU <--- thats the most close i have come whit CSS
[00:11:58] <Whiskey> it does everything espet the width
[00:12:11] <Whiskey> 10 ppl maybe have look on it no one have come whit a slotion how to do it
[00:12:44] <Whiskey> http://tinkerbin.com/WCgVAkCV <--- there is another way i have try
[00:13:11] <xjjk> #2 works for me (I think)
[00:13:19] <xjjk> both colmns are equal-sized?
[00:13:24] <Whiskey> end a third way http://tinkerbin.com/IEtF8Z2n <------
[00:13:32] <Whiskey> yeh but try to add something in the xjjk
[00:13:45] <Whiskey> when the data is bigger then the row, then it fails
[00:13:51] <xjjk> yes
[00:13:54] <xjjk> it always will
[00:13:58] <xjjk> what are you expecting it to do?
[00:14:11] <xjjk> clip the contents, or add a scrollbar?
[00:14:21] <xjjk> need to look at the CSS overflow property for that
[00:15:08] <Whiskey> http://tinkerbin.com/GG4Lb1FU <-- work as that does and equal sized
[00:15:21] <Whiskey> xjjk, no not overflow i don´t want to delete or remove everything
[00:16:08] <Whiskey> http://tinkerbin.com/S6Is3GvU <--- that one works correct but it has no box, no spacing
[00:16:35] <Whiskey> it make both have equal size, and expand after content
[00:16:51] <Whiskey> so i still think javascript is the correct way to do it
[00:19:00] <xjjk> mmm
[00:19:31] <Whiskey> You unserstand what i try to do xjjk?
[00:20:32] <xjjk> not exactly
[00:20:49] <Whiskey> http://tinkerbin.com/S6Is3GvU <--- you see what that does right
[00:21:14] <xjjk> yeah… I don't understand how that works exactly
[00:23:38] <Whiskey> http://tinkerbin.com/gtxkFcOc <--- try that one more close the my orginal one
[00:23:47] <Whiskey> and expand the rows whit some data in it and see what happens
[00:24:23] <Whiskey> its adjustible to the content inside it and make both rows equal size, that what i try to do
[00:24:34] <Whiskey> problem there is that the box is in the body, that will break everything
[00:24:43] <Whiskey> well border
[00:25:28] <Whiskey> whit other words, it just the width it needs to view the content, not more then needed
[00:25:52] <xjjk> can yo add another outer element with display: table, instead of using <body>
[00:26:17] <Whiskey> what you mean, not have display: table in body?
[00:26:17] <xjjk> yeh, sorry, I don't understand the display: table* CSS stuff very well
[00:26:37] <Whiskey> it needs to be there, it make all other stuff work in the code i have
[00:26:38] <xjjk> yes
[00:26:46] <xjjk> instead of putting it on <body>
[00:26:53] <xjjk> add another tag wrapping everything else
[00:27:08] <Whiskey> but thats not the problem
[00:27:15] <Whiskey> but i culd sure try
[00:27:21] <xjjk> if you do that
[00:27:25] <xjjk> you can add borders/etc again
[00:27:53] <xjjk> what was the problem?
[00:28:53] <Whiskey> http://tinkerbin.com/B9rc8qLv <-- you see the padding not working
[00:29:11] <Whiskey> allredy bin there :/
[00:29:15] <xjjk> yeah… I think you need to read the CSS spec for how display: table* works
[00:29:19] <xjjk> there are gotchas
[00:29:47] <Whiskey> its no other way to it whit table, and i have read out a whole css book the last days nothing have help me
[00:30:05] <xjjk> table cells do have padding
[00:30:27] <Whiskey> aaa thats not
[00:30:35] <Whiskey> http://tinkerbin.com/2KEPwP2Q <--- there you have it
[00:30:48] <Whiskey> you see know it use all width it can, thats why table is in body
[00:31:13] <Whiskey> whit table in body all stuff on the site have equal size
[00:31:28] <xjjk> you forgot display: table on .Width
[00:32:32] <xjjk> also, if you're using table formatting… don't use the floats
[00:33:33] <Whiskey> then what do you use?
[00:33:37] <Whiskey> text-align not work
[00:34:24] <Whiskey> http://tinkerbin.com/V2JYQpNW <-- breaks everything
[00:39:05] <aqeel> http://jailbreak.webege.com/js/plugins/aautoscroll.js
[00:39:27] <aqeel> edgescroll works once on and off, after that it does not work why?
[00:42:07] <Whiskey> xjjk: its really hard to slove
[00:42:22] <xjjk> Whiskey: if you use the table box model for everything, it should work, no?
[00:42:35] <Whiskey> yeh it does work
[00:42:40] <Whiskey> espect what i try to do now
[00:42:45] <xjjk> that is, without the floats
[00:42:51] <Whiskey> itts the only part that does not work
[00:43:00] <Whiskey> xjjk, but you can do left right side whitout float
[00:43:08] <Whiskey> and if you do div, it make newline
[00:44:12] <xjjk> Whiskey: but, yeh, anyway… yes you can use jQuery to set the widths, w/ what monk3y said earlier
[00:44:18] <xjjk> it's not ideal
[00:44:22] <Whiskey> i did not get that to work
[00:44:34] <xjjk> it'd be very tricky
[00:45:00] <xjjk> I'd use a regular table, figure out the widest colmn
[00:45:06] <xjjk> then set the width of the remaining colmns to that width
[00:45:33] <Whiskey> xjjk i can nothing about js
[00:47:51] <Whiskey> xjjk, the funny thing is that this style i have now works in chrome :/
[00:48:53] <coldhead> hahahaha
[00:49:23] <Whiskey> coldhead: ?
[00:49:54] <xjjk> Whiskey: have you consulted #css, or whatever the sister channel to us would be?
[00:50:51] <coldhead> you said it was funny
[00:51:14] <coldhead> ##css is the sister channel
[00:53:14] <Whiskey> xjjk: no one likes me there, allredy try consulted there in 3weels all them do is to get rid of the problem
[00:55:50] <Whiskey> xjjk; i belive http://jsfiddle.net/D9yu5/92/ and javascript is the slotion
[00:56:32] <Whiskey> it need to know the one whit most width as you told, then take it x2 to get it correct
[00:59:46] <shoky> Whiskey i wanna help but didn't fully understand what you want
[01:00:16] <Whiskey> how can ppl never understand
[01:01:10] <Whiskey> shoky: http://tinkerbin.com/4bX1pKHy look at that, add text on 2012, and see what happens
[01:01:18] <ccm84> because we dont speeka engrish
[01:01:55] <shoky> Whiskey: and what do you want to happen?
[01:02:10] <Whiskey> exaclty that
[01:02:19] <Whiskey> thats what i want to happen
[01:02:27] <shoky> ok
[01:03:49] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/zHjCp/ <-- try get that work in there :D
[01:05:15] <xjjk> Whiskey: sorry, computer froze
[01:05:26] <Whiskey> :P xjjk np
[01:05:30] <xjjk> loading up 12000 elements in a Web-based map was not a good idea, who knew
[01:05:38] <Whiskey> xjjk try to see if javascript can slove that :)
[01:05:50] <Whiskey> xjjk what did you espect?
[01:06:08] <xjjk> to not freeze the entire computer and require a reboot
[01:06:09] <shoky> Whiskey mmm and what's the problem with the fiddle?
[01:06:47] <Whiskey> shokey you kidding whit me
[01:06:50] <Whiskey> what webrowser are you using?
[01:07:07] <shoky> Whiskey: maybe i'm asking because i dont understand.. not because it works

[01:10:57] <JoeSlack> webkit vs moz
[01:11:30] <fabioportieri> i thought it might be a race condition issue but i put all the scripts in a single file, no changes
[01:12:50] <fabioportieri> i don't know what to do so any help will be greatly appreciated
[01:13:49] <Whiskey> shoky: you get the problem right ::D
[01:14:05] <shoky> Whiskey: i guess ;[

[01:14:36] <Whiskey> :P
[01:18:10] <fabioportieri> any help?
[01:27:51] <Whiskey> hehe no one?
[01:35:05] <anli__> When I Test->Run->All Tests, the tests in the test project is not running any longer, how come?
[01:35:25] <anli__> I know you cannot possibly know the details, just if anybody else has encountered this
[01:35:55] <noregret> does anyone use fineuploader plugin?
[01:37:44] <mink> Hello. Maybe anyone know how i can make this code shorten?  ->      $(".btn-fancybox-close").add(parent.$("#fancybox-overlay")).add(parent.$(".fancybox-close"))
[01:58:10] <grass7boy> hello
[01:58:20] <grass7boy> when we make string replacement
[01:59:06] <grass7boy> we want to replace "http://urlA" to "http://urlB" in a paragraph of text
[01:59:35] <grass7boy> we must using the regular expression /http:\/\/urlA/g
[01:59:47] <grass7boy> the question is...
[02:00:23] <grass7boy> what if the url we want to replace is non-static
[02:00:53] <grass7boy> maybe http://urlA, maybe http://jquery.com, maybe http://www.facebook.com/helloworld/
[02:01:11] <anli__> grass7boy: Why not using "http://" + foo + "/goo.html"?
[02:01:54] <grass7boy> how could we easily change the url string into the corresponding regexp?
[02:02:26] <grass7boy> "[contents of a text]".replace("http://some.url.com/")
[02:02:37] <grass7boy> may not global make replacement
[02:02:44] <grass7boy> may not make global  replacement
[02:02:59] <grass7boy> "[contents of a text]".replace("http://some.url.com/", "[another url]")
[02:03:04] <anli__> Why do you want to replace an url?
[02:03:21] <grass7boy> i wanna read a list of url array
[02:04:02] <grass7boy> each pair of url is stand for A url - A's replacement
[02:04:23] <anli__> Try to describe in a wider context
[02:04:40] <grass7boy> however, the list of url is supplied by user
[02:04:48] <anli__> How?
[02:05:04] <grass7boy> maybe from a textarea, whatever
[02:05:12] <grass7boy> this is a example
[02:05:16] <anli__> For what reason will  the user input those urls?
[02:05:17] <grass7boy> here is a example
[02:05:19] <anli__> What is it used for?
[02:05:27] <grass7boy> wait
[02:05:55] <grass7boy> http://grassboy.tw/NodeJS/urlreplace.txt
[02:05:59] <grass7boy> this is an example
[02:06:35] <grass7boy> the odd lines are the url i want to replace, and the even lines are the replacement
[02:06:46] <grass7boy> the input may be an html document
[02:07:12] <grass7boy> in php, we can using str_replace(urlA, urlB); to replace all urlA
[02:07:16] <grass7boy> but in javascript
[02:07:34] <grass7boy> we have to convert the urlA into its regular expression form
[02:08:48] <grass7boy> so ... i wonder know is there any easier ways to replace the url in whole html document
[02:39:21] <fabioportieri> hi, i have a weird issue with jcrop, only in chrome/safari: my jcrop_api reference is strangely undefined there, but works fine on other browsers: http://pastie.org/5615057, i thought it was a race condition issue but even by putting all scripts in a single file nothing changes
[02:48:09] <xxtjaxx> I think I found a glitch in jquery-ui if somebody could help me find where the proble lies would be cool. The glitch only occurs in iceweasel/firefox When I move my element it moves to top: -430px and doesn't show up again. This is the source for the element: http://paste.debian.net/221296/
[02:49:46] <xxtjaxx> Chrom(e/ium) works just fine
[02:50:10] <xxtjaxx> I'm also currently building most recent firefox to see if the issue persists
[02:56:29] <gazzwi86> I have a problem I need to solve but have no idea how to approach it, would anyone be able to suggest a methodology?
[02:56:35] <gazzwi86> : I have an array of items with a genre associated with each, and a group of 8 sliders with values 0 - 10.  If the slider is 10 then the venue with that genre must appear, if 0 then it should and variable in between.
[02:58:10] <xxtjaxx> gazzwi86: so you nhave a data structure like [ { value: /*from slider*/, venue: "Hollywood"} ] ?
[02:58:27] <xxtjaxx> gazzwi86: what slider do you have exactly?
[02:58:27] <rkirmizi> hi all. we developed a firfefox plugin, which comminucates with a document scanner device and fills the form with the collected data. We have a button on our plugin. when we click the plugin it fills the form. But now we have to use our web app in firefox's kiosk mode plugin (r-kiosk) so there is no plugin buttons are appearing. Now we added keyboard shortcuts to our plugin. And put a button in our web site. What i wanna do is when i click the butt
[02:58:27] <rkirmizi> on i want it to trigger a keybinding such as "ALT+SHIFT+L" then the form should fill on the click event.
[02:58:55] <aero1> does .html('<whatever>') work properly with IE7?
[03:00:37] <gazzwi86> xxtjaxx: I have query ui sliders that I can go and get the value for, and a separate ajax request with a list of venues, within which if a field with a coma separated list of genres
[03:03:50] <xxtjaxx> gazzwi86: can you pastebin the exact json of these responses?
[03:12:41] <shoky> Whiskey: sorry had to go, still need a solution?
[03:28:03] <gry> http://www.jqplot.com/docs/files/usage-txt.html says to use "jquery.jqplot.min.js" -- but I don't see it in the distribution ?
[03:28:24] <gry> I downloaded https://bitbucket.org/cleonello/jqplot/get/default.zip
[03:32:41] <shoky> gry: https://bitbucket.org/cleonello/jqplot/downloads
[03:33:07] <gry> shoky: yes, that's what I used... did I choose a wrong file?
[03:33:29] <shoky> guess so
[03:33:39] <shoky> i dont see any default.zip there..
[03:34:22] <shoky> yeah you downloaded the source
[04:05:37] <shoky> Whiskey: anyway.. couldn't figure out a simple cross-browser css-only solution for now.. so here's a js solution.. i think.  http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/4/
[04:08:49] <Whiskey> looks correct thx shoky :D
[04:09:44] <shoky> ;]
[04:10:17] <Whiskey> happy you did get the point :)(
[04:10:53] <shoky> heh
[04:10:54] <Whiskey> I don´t like that i need to use jQuery do to get it to work but its batter then have it broken
[04:12:20] <Whiskey> lets see if i can get it work whit my code
[04:14:08] <noregret> can someone tell me why isn't this running, the error's locations isn't clear, http://jsfiddle.net/SjsLq/
[04:15:23] <ravenzz> noregret try running JSLint on it and fixing the errors
[04:15:32] <shoky> noregret: you didnt close the docready
[04:15:47] <shoky> and the error's location is very clear...
[04:17:23] <shoky> well, in chrome it is
[04:20:47] <Whiskey> shoky itsonly a samll problem
[04:23:13] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/4/ not sure what i broke
[04:23:41] <noregret> oh yeah, thanks, didn't notice it
[04:23:59] <shoky> Whiskey that's the same link ;p
[04:25:24] <shoky> Whiskey click update ;p
[04:26:06] <Whiskey> shokey :D
[04:26:11] <Whiskey> im just an idiot
[04:26:17] <shoky> yay
[04:26:51] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/5/ <-- how do you get some space between the two cells
[04:28:21] <ziyadb> Hi, i have numbered ids. Will this work? .attr('id', 'id'++)
[04:29:20] <shesek> ziyadb, no.
[04:29:27] <ziyadb> shesek: alternative?
[04:31:04] <ziyadb> shesek: ah, the data method?
[04:31:29] <shoky> you want to incremeent the id?
[04:32:26] <ziyadb> shoky: yes.
[04:32:29] <ziyadb> Changed it to $('article[id!=newPost').each(function() {
[04:32:29] <ziyadb>    $(this).attr("id", newId);
[04:32:29] <ziyadb>    newId++;
[04:32:51] <shoky> huh.
[04:32:54] <shoky> umm
[04:32:56] <shoky> this.id++;
[04:32:59] <shoky> would do it
[04:33:00] <shoky> :\
[04:33:12] <ziyadb> Oh, so as an argument of the .attr function?
[04:33:16] <shoky> no
[04:33:22] <ziyadb> .attr('id', this.id++) ?
[04:33:25] <shoky> no
[04:33:30] <shoky> just:  this.id++;
[04:33:39] <shoky> no attr
[04:33:49] <ziyadb> Oh, right.
[04:34:07] <ziyadb> So in all, it would be $('article[id!=newPost).id++ ?
[04:34:24] <shoky> you'd still need the .each
[04:34:28] <shoky> or:
[04:34:36] <shoky> $('article[id!=newPost').prop
[04:34:37] <shoky> oops
[04:35:20] <ziyadb> So  $('article[id!=newPost]).each.id++ ?
[04:35:26] <shoky> $('article[id!=newPost').prop('id', function() { return +this.id + 1 })
[04:35:44] <Whiskey> shokey?
[04:35:46] <shoky> no, with the .each it'd be:  $('article[id!=newPost]).each(function() { this.id++ })
[04:36:01] <ziyadb> Right, fair enough.
[04:36:24] <ziyadb> I'll probably use that one over the prop method, since that would be analogous to using the attr method.
[04:36:32] <shoky> wrong ;]
[04:36:53] <shoky> hmm
[04:37:19] <ziyadb> the prop would be analogous to the attr, no?
[04:37:28] <shoky> anyway you're doing it all wrong. id's shouldn't change usually
[04:37:50] <ziyadb> I'm inserting new content and modifying accordingly.
[04:37:57] <shoky> what you usally care about is the property, not the attribute
[04:38:07] <ziyadb> e.g. new div, then change new div to 1 and increment all following divs.
[04:38:18] <shoky> but jquery and the browser let you get away with confusing them
[04:38:23] <shoky> usually
[04:38:24] <ziyadb> what's the distinction between the two?
[04:38:54] <seutje> why do u need the numeric IDs anyway?
[04:39:38] <seutje> u can easily grab its index without trying to keep ur state in ur IDs
[04:39:42] <shoky> attributes are what's on the HTML elements (and natively are get/set by get/setAttribute) , properties are the run-time fields of the DOM node object
[04:40:10] <shoky> many attributes and proerties have the same or similar names, and the browser copies one to the other for some of them
[04:40:13] <shoky> so it gets confusing
[04:40:29] <ziyadb> seutje: to keep track of them..
[04:40:33] <shoky> more confusing because jquery<1.6  used attr when it should've used prop
[04:40:47] <shoky> and for backwards compatibility, it still allows you to use attr when you should use prop
[04:41:09] <seutje> ziyadb: u string.replace and parseint the IDs to get the index?
[04:41:13] <ziyadb> shoky: so the attributes are an html concept that is mirrored by the DOM in its properties concept?
[04:41:30] <shoky> ziyadb: its not fully mirrored, but yeah pretty much
[04:42:04] <ziyadb> seutje: pretty much.
[04:42:06] <noregret> is it a good idea to always stay linked to http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js ? instead of always updating manually
[04:42:20] <ziyadb> shoky: ah, so I should manipulate the properties, not the attributes...
[04:42:21] <seutje> ziyadb: see ?index
[04:42:21] <bot-t1> ziyadb, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[04:42:31] <shoky> ziyadb: you shjould use .data()
[04:42:48] <Whiskey> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/6/ my lasst one but it miss cell spacing
[04:42:48] <shoky> and if you want to set it on the HTML
[04:42:57] <shoky> then use data-XXX attributes
[04:43:02] <shoky> and get them with .data()
[04:43:18] <ziyadb> What if I wish to set a custom attribute?
[04:43:30] <shoky> data-mycustomattribute="1"
[04:43:33] <seutje> like on click u could just $wrapper.children().index(this) instead of parseInt(this.id.replace('someshit-', ''), 10)
[04:44:03] <shoky> ziyadb: or do you mean, set the attribute at runtime?
[04:44:10] <seutje> or just $(this).index() even
[04:45:18] <ziyadb> seutje: I still don't understand that fully, I'll review the link you sent and your suggestions. Thanks!
[04:45:31] <ziyadb> shoky: at runtime. To keep track of the changes to sync to the server.
[04:45:50] <ziyadb> e.g. <div edited="true">
[04:46:13] <ziyadb> then I'd $('div[edited=true'])
[04:46:56] <shoky> ziyadb: for simple stuff like edited=true  i'd use a class instead
[04:47:27] <ziyadb> shoky: simple enough. Cool.
[04:47:55] <shoky> ziyadb: and, for other stuff i'd use .data() to get/set (even though it doesn't set the actual data-xxx attribute)
[04:48:04] <ziyadb> shoky: thank you!
[04:48:08] <shoky> and if you must select based on that, you can use .filter(..)
[04:48:11] <seutje> ziyadb: index just looks up the position of the element it's called on, in relation to its direct siblings.
[04:48:16] <gry> shoky: sorry. what is the latest stable version please?
[04:48:16] <ziyadb> What are you referring to by data-xxx attributes.
[04:48:25] <shoky> Whiskey: sorry ill check in a bit ;]
[04:48:41] <shoky> gry: no idea
[04:49:19] <ziyadb> seutje: yes, just read that. So instead of the fuckery I had going on with the id and what-not. I'd just call the index method on each of the elements?
[04:49:45] <seutje> ziyadb: not when adding/sorting but when u need the nu;ber
[04:49:48] <seutje> number even
[04:49:56] <ziyadb> e.g. $('div').each(index); yeah?
[04:50:20] <seutje> nah
[04:50:42] <shoky> ziyadb: i mean like  <div data-bla="1" />    then in js:  var bla = $('div').data('bla');  $('div').data('bla', bla + 1);  ...   $('div').filter(function() { return $(this).data('bla') < 20 })   for example
[04:51:01] <seutje> do u want to target a specific item in the set or do u want a way to grab its position in the set when u have a specific item?
[04:51:22] <ziyadb> Hmmm, wait a minute..
[04:51:45] <ziyadb> I don't think what I have will work.
[04:52:10] <seutje> like $('div').eq(7).hide(); or like $('div').on('click', function () { alert($(this).index()); });
[04:52:38] <seutje> first is targetting the 8th div, second alerts its position in the set when clicking a div
[04:53:19] <ziyadb> Ah, understood.
[04:53:19] <xxtjaxx> I have a draggable example with cancled elements and containment which has a strange bug in firefox. Here is a fiddle for it: http://jsfiddle.net/eDXWz/1/ anybody else seeing this?
[04:53:27] <ziyadb> seutje: thank you very much!
[04:53:47] <seutje> so u see, there rly isn't any need to keep the order in the IDs, you can easily look it up or target it when needed
[04:54:26] <ziyadb> Yeah, thank you!
[04:54:39] <seutje> only when working on gigantic tables where half your content isn't actually in the DOM half the time does it become interesting to keep a separate reference, but then ur prolly better off with a regular old off-DOM object or array
[04:54:50] <ziyadb> Smart!
[04:55:01] <seutje> lies!
[04:55:11] <ziyadb> How do I change IDs to null then? id(null) or empty string? id("")?
[04:55:42] <seutje> ?removeattr
[04:55:42] <bot-t1> .removeAttr(attributeName): Remove an attribute from each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/removeAttr/
[04:55:53] <ziyadb> seutje: hmm, you're right! I seem to be restricting my JS code to operating in the DOM
[04:55:58] <ziyadb> Right. thanks!
[04:56:00] <shoky> Whiskey: uhh you totally changed it though ;p
[04:57:02] <shoky> Whiskey: it doesnt look good in chrome anymore
[04:57:33] <Whiskey> :&
[04:57:41] <Whiskey> its true? i make it almost the same
[04:57:41] <Whiskey> :/
[04:57:51] <shoky> you put back floats..
[04:58:13] <Whiskey> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/5/ that one
[04:58:16] <Whiskey> looks fine in crhome
[04:58:32] <shoky> ok, you want spacing between the 2?
[04:59:23] <Whiskey> yeh
[04:59:28] <Whiskey> looks like thats the only missing part
[05:00:23] <shoky> Whiskey ok how's this  http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/7/
[05:00:47] <shoky> good ol' margin-right
[05:01:08] <Whiskey> its suxs :D where did you set the spaceing?
[05:01:29] <shoky> heh, look for zzz
[05:03:44] <shoky> eh why did you bring back display:table :\
[05:03:57] <Whiskey> thats fine
[05:03:58] <Whiskey> thx :)
[05:04:04] <shoky> plz http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/8/
[05:04:09] <Whiskey> cuz the other stuff depends on it :)
[05:04:19] <Schrostfutz> can someone help me with some css? i want a div, containing 3 divs. the last one should be oriented right, the other two left. the last two should be vertically aranged in the middle
[05:04:23] <shoky> not in this fiddle ;p
[05:04:36] <Whiskey> hehe works fine for me :)
[05:04:42] <Whiskey> thx alot for your help shoky
[05:04:47] <shoky> np
[05:05:22] <seutje> that looks a mighty lot like tabular data... :P
[05:06:45] <GrafVampir> Hello all!)) Who worked with jquery.tipTip?
[05:11:17] <Whiskey> shoky: var els = $('.infoViewLine'); can you get that to read two classes?
[05:13:01] <seutje> $('.foo.bar')
[05:13:10] <seutje> will match <div class="foo bar">
[05:13:18] <Whiskey> no
[05:13:27] <seutje> but not <div class="foo"> or <div class="bar">
[05:13:31] <seutje> no?
[05:13:32] <Whiskey> <div class="foo"> && <div class="bar">
[05:13:36] <Whiskey> that was what i wanted
[05:13:40] <seutje> oh
[05:13:49] <seutje> $('.foo, .bar')
[05:13:54] <Whiskey> hmm did try that
[05:14:20] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/9/ look at that seutje
[05:14:55] <mazzachre> I have a problem I am wondering if anyone else have had before... I want an element on top (higher zindex) except if the mouse is over the element (or over any element that is then over that element) then I want the element to be below (lower zindex), best described here http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/KXnTJ/12/ try resizing "test" to the west
[05:15:22] <seutje> Whiskey: well, it seems to match both...
[05:15:38] <Whiskey> but twhy does it broken then
[05:15:59] <Whiskey> aaa did miss a thing :=)
[05:16:04] <johnkpaul> mazzachre: you probably need to have another element that is transparent at a higher zindex
[05:16:13] <johnkpaul> and keep track of the mouseenter/mouseleave events on that
[05:16:51] <mazzachre> johnkpaul: But then how does that interferre with the resizing?
[05:16:53] <seutje> sounds like a case for pointer events? :D
[05:17:07] <johnkpaul> seutje: sure, if you only need ie9
[05:17:32] <johnkpaul> mazzachre: you just need to resize that transparent element in the same way
[05:17:41] <seutje> johnkpaul: actually, not even :(
[05:17:51] <johnkpaul> oh really? damn
[05:18:06] <seutje> IE only does it on SVG, doesn;t it?
[05:18:21] <ziyadb> Quick question!
[05:18:33] <johnkpaul> seutje: yeah, you're right
[05:18:57] <mazzachre> Oh, so I should want a transparent resizeable element over the bar, not the vertical elements? And then syncronized resize the bar... Hmmm...
[05:19:00] <ziyadb> I need to round up elements & their inner HTML and ajax them to a server.. Not sure how I'd go about the json format part...
[05:19:06] <seutje> but yeah, then I guess u need to either do the whole invisible element above or just track the mouse location the entire time
[05:19:12] <seutje> the latter being a royal pita
[05:19:24] <johnkpaul> mazzachre: yeah, that's my suggestion
[05:19:36] <ziyadb> e.g. $("article.edited") <- selector. Now how do I assemble it into JSON format?
[05:21:09] <seutje> can u JSON.stringify html elements straight up? not sure
[05:21:34] <ziyadb> I don't even know what stringify means..
[05:21:43] <seutje> turn it into JSON
[05:22:01] <johnkpaul> seutje: I don't think that you can stringify dom elements at all
[05:22:05] <seutje> JSON is a format usually reserved for pure data
[05:22:19] <johnkpaul> ziyadb: what do you want in the json format?
[05:22:35] <johnkpaul> $("article.edited") returns a jquery object that wraps dom elements
[05:22:38] <ziyadb> johnkpaul: I want to sync changes to the server. That's all.
[05:22:39] <johnkpaul> from that, what do you want to serialize
[05:22:43] <johnkpaul> ziyadb: changes to what?
[05:22:46] <johnkpaul> the HTML?
[05:22:50] <ziyadb> Yes..
[05:23:14] <ziyadb> The contents of the <article> element.
[05:23:31] <seutje> just .html() and send that?
[05:23:31] <johnkpaul> ziyadb: JSON.stringify($("article.edited").map(function(i, e){return $(e).html()}))
[05:23:38] <noregret> http://jsfiddle.net/SjsLq/2/ can someone help in aligning the jqueryui icon in the box
[05:23:48] <seutje> right, not just the first, I suppose
[05:24:19] <johnkpaul> yeah, my code is assuming there are multiple
[05:24:29] <ziyadb> johnkpaul: that's all?
[05:24:33] <seutje> healthy assumption
[05:24:39] <johnkpaul> :)
[05:24:42] <ziyadb> Awesome!
[05:25:09] <ziyadb> I must ask though, what's the i argument in function(i, e) ?
[05:25:17] <seutje> index
[05:25:33] <ziyadb> And it's supplied by the map method?
[05:25:40] <seutje> si
[05:25:42] <seutje> ?map
[05:25:43] <bot-t1> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[05:25:53] <ziyadb> magnifique. Thanks gentlemen!
[05:25:55] <seutje> fine, don't show the arguments passed to the callback
[05:26:03] <Whiskey> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/10/ <-- How do you make the other two come on newline insted of same line?
[05:27:02] <ziyadb> But the index isn't incremented, what's the point of it?
[05:27:26] <ziyadb> and, can't it be function(){ return this.html()}) ?
[05:27:40] <seutje> html isn't a method available on DOM nodes
[05:27:49] <seutje> u'd need this.innerHTML then
[05:27:59] <seutje> or wait
[05:28:11] <seutje> does map operate on the jquery collection or the DOM node collection?
[05:28:32] <seutje> to the api machine!
[05:28:36] <ziyadb> seutje: Within the callback function, this refers to the current DOM element for each iteration.
[05:28:42] <Whiskey> http://dabblet.com/gist/4443457 <-- that shows batter seutje
[05:28:43] <deanstl> ziyadb: why do you want to convert a string to an object and then back to a string?
[05:28:53] <seutje> yeah, the element, not jquery object
[05:29:02] <seutje> so yeah, this.innerHTML should do
[05:29:21] <Whiskey> lol
[05:29:34] <seutje> Whiskey: set #container to block instead of inline-block
[05:29:41] <seutje> Whiskey: also, #container is in there twice
[05:29:45] <seutje> duplicate IDs no guud
[05:30:06] <ziyadb> deanstl: I don't want to do anything, I just want to get the contents of the elements and send them to the server.
[05:30:58] <Whiskey> hmm need to change it to class then: :D
[05:31:30] <ziyadb> seutje: therefore I can omit the args passed to the unnamed function, correct?
[05:31:48] <ziyadb> i.e. function() { this.innerHTML }
[05:32:10] <ziyadb> I think that might break it.
[05:32:17] <seutje> ziyadb: yeah, but u'll still need the "return" word in there :P
[05:32:38] <seutje> and I'm not a fan of leaving semicolon injection to JS's weird system
[05:32:57] <seutje> but I guess this is a pretty safe case
[05:33:19] <seutje> anyway, coffee smokey time!
[05:33:49] <ziyadb> seutje: thanks!
[05:34:01] <noregret> http://jsfiddle.net/SjsLq/2/ can someone help in aligning the jqueryui icon in the box
[05:35:02] <Whiskey> seutje: one problem left: http://tinkerbin.com/0YhOzwRT
[05:35:05] <Whiskey> do you see it :D
[05:40:45] <Whiskey> actully i found two stuff that fials
[05:41:14] <_sCoRpi> Whiskey: are you talking about the wrong alignment?
[05:41:54] <deanstl> noregret: don't see any icon.
[05:42:22] <noregret> oops, forgot to update, http://jsfiddle.net/SjsLq/3/
[05:42:25] <noregret> deanstl: ^
[05:42:33] <Whiskey> no no :D
[05:42:44] <Whiskey> http://tinkerbin.com/xSKZitlS <-- two errors
[05:42:56] <Whiskey> first the border don´t have same size automatic as the other two
[05:43:06] <Whiskey> Second the lines are not same width as the longest one
[05:43:20] <Whiskey> All lines shuld be as first one :)
[05:44:01] <_sCoRpi> question: why don't you just float the rigth infobox right and the left one left?
[05:44:17] <_sCoRpi> the right box will never change size if it will only display the date in this format
[05:45:07] <Whiskey> what you mean?
[05:46:16] <_sCoRpi> you have infoViewLine-Left and infoViewLine-Right
[05:46:29] <_sCoRpi> if you just float infoViewLine-Left left and infoViewLine-Right right
[05:46:39] <Whiskey> yeh that does not help
[05:46:44] <_sCoRpi> then they should be automatically properly aligned
[05:46:54] <_sCoRpi> maybe i'm misunderstanding your problem
[05:47:59] <Whiskey> _sCoRpi: http://tinkerbin.com/cNMXZpyc thats more correct
[05:48:48] <Whiskey> but as you can see the lines are not same width :(/
[05:49:31] <_sCoRpi> Whiskey: your javascript isn't even executed
[05:49:40] <motka> which js?
[05:50:06] <_sCoRpi> his spaceIt() function
[05:50:32] <sherlock-holmes> any pastebins ?
[05:50:36] <Whiskey> oo
[05:51:26] <_sCoRpi> i don't know tinkerbin @ Whiskey, but it complains about jquery missing...
[05:52:02] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/pg3jp/4/ <-- there ytou go
[05:52:29] <sherlock-holmes> happy new year to all :D
[05:52:34] <deanstl> noregret: simplest change made.  you may want to force the button height to be larger
[05:54:33] <noregret> deanstl: it's height will incrase downwards, so it will stay the same
[05:54:50] <_sCoRpi> Whiskey: your Endbox gets the same size automatically becuase you set its width to 100%
[05:55:35] <Whiskey> yeh maybe :/
[05:55:55] <Whiskey> wee
[05:55:55] <Whiskey> :)
[05:55:59] <Whiskey> only one problem left :D
[05:56:42] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/pg3jp/5/ <--- why them not equal sized
[05:56:57] <boulet101010> hi, how to change the selected option of a <select> via javascript ?
[05:57:53] <_sCoRpi> Whiskey: all 3 boxes have the same size in chrome
[05:58:35] <mazzachre> johnkpaul: I have edited my example to this http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/KXnTJ/16/ which almost works... Only resize W does something unexpected, what to do?
[05:58:42] <Whiskey> yeh i mean the rows
[05:59:03] <_sCoRpi> Whiskey: left and right should be the same size?
[05:59:17] <_sCoRpi> or 1st left and 2nd left should be the same size?
[06:00:17] <iman> hi guys, I want to call a function when user clicks in each cell of table (<td>) in a table and send <td>'s id to that cell, how can i do that
[06:01:19] <Whiskey> all shuld be same size
[06:01:44] <mazzachre> Can anyone help me with why the resize to W changes the E position too? Resize E works as expected
[06:02:44] <mazzachre> http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/KXnTJ/16/ ^^
[06:04:18] <_sCoRpi> Whiskey: and using width:50% doesn'T work?
[06:04:52] <_sCoRpi> (of course that will wrap your lines)
[06:05:22] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/11/ _sCoRpi like that
[06:05:26] <Whiskey> but for all rows,
[06:06:38] <_sCoRpi> Whiskey: so you want them to be 50% the size of your parent container
[06:06:45] <_sCoRpi> so why don't you make them exactly 50%?
[06:06:52] <_sCoRpi> or maybe 49% and 1% margin
[06:07:40] <Whiskey> yeh
[06:07:49] <_sCoRpi> maybe i still don't get your problem but i think you don't need any js at all
[06:08:32] <Whiskey> well ofc i do
[06:08:54] <anli__> Can I use $.fn.extend directly, or do I have to wait for ready?
[06:09:17] <anli__> directly=immediately
[06:09:27] <Whiskey> _sCoRpi: no one have mange to do it whitout JS
[06:11:53] <_sCoRpi> Whiskey: can you quickly illustrate what you really want to do?
[06:12:04] <mazzachre> Whiskey: Look at box model, maybe that is your problem
[06:12:07] <_sCoRpi> if you just want 2 columsn per row, which both are 50% wide - then i don't see the problem
[06:12:16] <_sCoRpi> *columns
[06:15:55] <Whiskey> it won´t work _sCoRpi
[06:16:02] <Whiskey> let ssee if i can find something i have done bfore
[06:16:33] <Whiskey> http://tinkerbin.com/IEtF8Z2n <---
[06:16:40] <mazzachre> It must be a simple error somewhere, but I can't seem to figure it out... please help http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/KXnTJ/16/ (resize W or left, adds size to the E or right, while resize to the right works normally)
[06:17:34] <mazzachre> Arg.... tables for layout...
[06:19:10] <Whiskey> _sCoRpi: http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/12/ that one is close
[06:20:58] <Whiskey> _sCoRpi: http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/13/ <--- see them not respect all just the one in the container :/
[06:21:02] <_sCoRpi> Whiskey: sorry but i cannot follow your thoughts. you have containers, which you make bigger by using javascript
[06:21:04] <Whiskey> and if you add the other in same container it will error
[06:21:29] <_sCoRpi> lets see
[06:21:59] <Whiskey> i belive 1/2 have same size,, and 3/4 have equal size
[06:22:17] <_sCoRpi> no
[06:22:22] <_sCoRpi> they all have different sizes
[06:22:27] <_sCoRpi> since you set them to inline-block
[06:22:59] <_sCoRpi> give me a second
[06:24:50] <Whiskey> np
[06:30:06] <_sCoRpi> Whiskey: http://jsfiddle.net/FMvPL/1/
[06:30:10] <_sCoRpi> is this what you are talking about?
[06:30:49] <Lindrian> Aww, wheres Stephen
[06:33:08] <Whiskey> yeh but no new line
[06:33:54] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/FMvPL/2/ fail
[06:34:08] <Whiskey> you not allowed to set width
[06:34:14] <Whiskey> it need to be adjustible
[06:34:33] <Whiskey> and not se overflow ether
[06:35:51] <Whiskey> _sCoRpi: http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/8/ look at that one it works 100% whit two lines
[06:36:08] <_sCoRpi> Whiskey: you didn't metion that once ;)
[06:36:26] <_sCoRpi> i just set the width because i need some width to test it against
[06:36:30] <_sCoRpi> it will also work with 100% width
[06:36:43] <_sCoRpi> why don#t you want overflow hidden?
[06:36:49] <_sCoRpi> it's not hiding anything
[06:37:07] <_sCoRpi> if you aren't using negative offsets you'll be fine
[06:37:11] <Whiskey> its not expandsafter the content right
[06:37:20] <_sCoRpi> why don't you just try first?
[06:37:29] <Whiskey> i have try in 3 weeks
[06:37:41] <_sCoRpi> i meant now
[06:37:48] <_sCoRpi> just add some text to the boxes in my fiddle
[06:37:55] <_sCoRpi> you'll see that the line height adjusts itself
[06:38:09] <_sCoRpi> so what's the problem?
[06:38:32] <sampaka> i want to replace 1 if my var $i -  $('.views-row-1') - cannot get the right syntax
[06:40:16] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/FMvPL/3/ <---
[06:40:17] <_sCoRpi> sampaka: $('.views-row-'+$i)
[06:40:18] <Whiskey> missing text
[06:40:34] <_sCoRpi> but
[06:40:38] <_sCoRpi> why $i?
[06:40:44] <_sCoRpi> you just mean i, right?
[06:40:47] <_sCoRpi> sampaka: $('.views-row-'+i)
[06:40:50] <_sCoRpi> like this
[06:40:50] <sampaka> ok
[06:40:54] <sampaka> thanks
[06:41:29] <_sCoRpi> whiskey: that is expected behaviour - _always_
[06:41:40] <_sCoRpi> since you just write one long string
[06:41:46] <_sCoRpi> the browser doesn't know how to wrap the  text
[06:42:27] <Whiskey> yeh the js don´t have that problem
[06:44:02] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/15/ <-- 100% correct whit same text
[06:44:24] <Whiskey> and some more actully the date: was no int here
[06:44:29] <_sCoRpi> whiskey: i'm not discussing
[06:44:42] <Whiskey> what?
[06:44:45] <_sCoRpi> if you think the js version is more suitable, use it - but i think you're kind of wasting your time ;)
[06:44:48] <Whiskey> JS does a batter job
[06:45:00] <Whiskey> why when i can get HTML to work whit same result?
[06:45:18] <noregret> http://jsfiddle.net/SjsLq/3/ can someone help in aligning the icon in the box
[06:45:32] <Whiskey> anyways im off for now :D
[06:45:37] <Whiskey> bbl :) and thx all fo the help this far
[06:47:35] <nFFF> noregret, that has nothing to do with jQuery??
[06:47:45] <ziyadb> Hi.
[06:47:48] <nFFF> but margin: 0 auto; on the element will centre it
[06:48:17] <_sCoRpi> noregret: http://jsfiddle.net/SjsLq/5/
[06:48:21] <ziyadb> Why is this returning a syntax error? $("body").click(function() { newPost.attr('content-editable'. 'false'); saveChanges();});
[06:48:26] <ziyadb> newPost is defined and all.
[06:48:54] <tlkr> and ('content-editable'. 'false') should be ('content-editable', 'false')
[06:49:05] <tlkr> comma
[06:49:37] <ziyadb> tlkr: silly me, thanks!
[06:49:51] <tlkr> =]
[06:49:53] <noregret> _sCoRpi: nice, where are mostly the changes
[06:50:08] <_sCoRpi> check the css for .qq-upload-button .ui-icon
[06:50:19] <_sCoRpi> but as nFFF said, it has nothing to do with jquery ;)
[06:50:31] <noregret> thanks anyway :)

[06:52:57] <slainer68> hi
[06:59:24] <the_hack> Can someone explain why this function wrapper is necessary: http://jsfiddle.net/hrRbb/9/ ?
[07:00:49] <katsh> is it possible to get en element under the mouse cursor? (not really hover)
[07:01:25] <katsh> once I hove out of an element, i want to collapse another unless the mouse is on it
[07:02:17] <mazzachre> katsh: make a plugin that binds the two elements together and handles mouse in/out for both...
[07:02:59] <ziyadb> Hi all
[07:03:25] <ziyadb> Why isn't this working? $('article').dblclick(function() { this.attr('content-editable', true)});
[07:03:49] <ziyadb> According to the debugger, HTML property doesn't have an attr method. So how do I make it work?
[07:04:04] <katsh> mazzachre: i guess i could do that too. thanks for the tip
[07:04:49] <Haprog> ziyadb: this in event context is usually a DOM node, not a jQuery object so you need $(this).attr(...)
[07:05:29] <ziyadb> Haprog: ah, fair enough. I'll try it.
[07:06:56] <ziyadb> Haprog: still not working :(
[07:07:11] <Haprog> maybe there's something else wrong then
[07:07:27] <nFFF> whats the new error?
[07:08:12] <ziyadb> Haprog: probably, fiddling around.
[07:08:22] <ziyadb> nFFF: no error. Just not working, I wrote something wrong.
[07:09:09] <ziyadb> nFFF: Nothing happens when I double click.
[07:09:31] <ziyadb> The content-editable attribute isn't set.
[07:09:54] <Saaether> ziyadb http://jsfiddle.net/fbZgc/ example of it working fine
[07:10:26] <nFFF> ^^
[07:10:44] <ziyadb> Heh, not even the example is working. Perhaps there is something wrong with my doubleclick input mechanism.
[07:11:19] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/fbZgc/1/
[07:11:23] <nFFF> you get nothing on dblclick?
[07:11:49] <ziyadb> That worked..
[07:12:17] <ziyadb> But setting the content-editable attribute doesn't make the content editable for some reason.
[07:12:49] <ziyadb> as demonstrated by my failure to use Saaether's fiddle.
[07:13:00] <nFFF> Ok so it's not to do with it not setting the attribute
[07:13:05] <nFFF> its do with another part of your code
[07:13:22] <surfdue> I am using the bootstrap-wysihtml5 editor (https://github.com/jhollingworth/bootstrap-wysihtml5) I can't seem to focus on the text area i know the original one is hidden, but I cannot get the cursor in the editor. any ideas?
[07:13:53] <Saaether> ziyadb http://jsfiddle.net/fbZgc/2/
[07:14:03] <Saaether> its contenteditable not content-editable
[07:14:59] <ziyadb> Saaether: OH, my GOD!
[07:15:05] <ziyadb> THANK YOU!
[07:16:17] <the_hack> Can anyone explain why script inside an event handler triggers onload (without the event taking place) unless it is wrapped in an anonymous function: http://jsfiddle.net/hrRbb/10/
[07:19:12] <nFFF> the_hack, the function/code is called straight away. If not wrapped, the code is called, if wrapped the anon function is called/defined, the function doesn't have to be anon but it almsot always is
[07:19:41] <BLeg> nFFF beat me to it but that is why... .click() expects a callback
[07:19:58] <sampaka> i need to replace 2 by a var: which is the right syntax? $('#edit-field-paper-credit-layout-und>option:eq(2)')
[07:20:32] <the_hack> nFFF: BLeg: THanks.
[07:21:32] <ziyadb> nFFF: re: code called straight away. So how do I keep it from being called unless the event is triggered? Wrap it inside a function?
[07:21:41] <nFFF> ziyadb, exactly
[07:22:07] <nFFF> basically the function is define on page load, and is called from within the event when it happens
[07:22:28] <nFFF> its anonymous becuase naming it is useless as it can't be called from anywhere else due to scope
[07:22:47] <nFFF> some people move the function outside fo the event callback if needing to call function from other places
[07:22:54] <ziyadb> Not entirely clear.
[07:23:49] <ziyadb> So if I wrap the click event handler inside an anon function (which is called on load by default?), how will that keep it from doing whatever I wrapped inside the function (event handler) right away?
[07:24:52] <nFFF> this is only activated by clicking the link
[07:24:58] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/hrRbb/11/
[07:24:58] <johnkpaul> mazzachre: it seems to be working for me
[07:25:00] <johnkpaul> did you figure it out?
[07:25:28] <nFFF> ziyadb, becuase when you define a function, the code inside is never called until you explicitly call the function
[07:25:45] <nFFF> forget the event, just think of normal code, if you have code outside of a function, it is called line by line
[07:25:49] <nFFF> if you wrap it in a function
[07:25:59] <ziyadb> Yes, yes! The function isn't called by itself.
[07:26:02] <nFFF> you hav to explicitly call the function to run the code
[07:26:03] <ziyadb> Got it.
[07:26:25] <ziyadb> and I assume the caveat is that the code inside the function is triggered if the event occurs?
[07:26:44] <nFFF> yes so when the event occurs, it calls your anonymous function which runs the code inside
[07:27:08] <Haprog> it doesn't even matter if it's an anonymous function or a named function. both work exactly the same in that situation.
[07:27:10] <nFFF> or like in the example any function, it doesn't have to be anonymous, and the function doesn't have to be defined within the callback
[07:27:15] <nFFF> you can move to logic otuside of the handler
[07:27:23] <nFFF> incase you want to re-use the function
[07:27:40] <aviraldg> ziyadb, your first example calls alert and returns the result to the click function.
[07:28:31] <ziyadb> nFFF: that confused me a little, "when the event occurs, it calls your anonymous function which runs the code inside".
[07:29:08] <ziyadb> I thought I was supposed to wrap the event handler AND the logic inside the function. But that implies that the event handler should be out by itself and have it call the function containing the logic.
[07:29:18] <nFFF> you can have both
[07:29:41] <nFFF> one moment
[07:42:21] <ziyadb> Hey guys, I am now having a JSON issue Uncaught TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON . Here's the code var changes = JSON.stringify($("article.edited").map(function(i, e){return $(e).html()}))
[07:42:24] <kegster> how can i determine which script is changing phone numbers on a site?
[07:43:09] <sejo> can I send 1 parameter as json with a ajax call?
[07:44:02] <waspinator> how would I animate the body to move smoothly up after banner fades out? http://jsfiddle.net/waspinator/3jLdr/1/
[07:46:34] <katsh> mazzachre: should i be looking at add() and on() for that?
[07:48:31] <aviraldg> waspinator, http://jsfiddle.net/cx6Jk/
[07:49:08] <waspinator> aviraldg, great thanks!
[07:49:19] <aviraldg> np :)
[07:56:01] <iman> how can i get button's id after press it ? http://jsfiddle.net/gSj4B/
[07:57:14] <shoky> iman: http://jsfiddle.net/gSj4B/2/
[07:57:15] <iman> i can get event.currentTarget  but i need button's id to prepare an ajax request
[07:57:26] <mazzachre> katsh: Sry, was working... I would use something like hover() on both elements, and put each element as data to the other element and check in the "out" if the other is "in" and so forth, then if both are "out", close them.
[07:59:04] <iman> shoky: it works, thank you, does 'this' point to this element ?
[07:59:20] <iman> this element who fires action
[07:59:25] <shoky> iman: yep
[07:59:33] <iman> thanks
[07:59:38] <shoky> iman: event.currentTarget.id would work too
[07:59:50] <iman> thank you
[08:01:17] <Lexi> I'm working on some animations using the animate.css compatibility library. I'm trying to call the animations $(".note").addClass('animated fadeInRightBig'); (There is no other way to do it in this instance) but the problem is the objects visible for a split second before jquery loads and the animation kicks in.. Anyone know a solution?
[08:02:06] <Lexi> when I set visibility: hidden; in css and call $(".note").style.visibility="visible"; before the animation call, it doesn't work.. it just stays hidden
[08:03:28] <ziyadb> Having some simple trouble with variable scope. newPost = $('article:first'); $("body").click(function() { newPost.attr('contenteditable', 'false'); says that newPost is undefined!
[08:03:48] <shoky> Lexi: $('.note').css('visibility', 'visible')   or just use a class for it
[08:04:32] <Lexi> worked perfectly, thank you shoky!
[08:04:36] <Lexi> Jquery is such a delight
[08:05:40] <ziyadb> How can it be undefined when I've defined it globally and it's referenced from a anon function scope?
[08:06:17] <shoky> it?
[08:07:31] <shoky> oh didnt notice
[08:07:58] <pachet> ziyadb: var newPost
[08:08:07] <pachet> and if that doesnt fix it then we need more context
[08:08:12] <ziyadb> shoky: yeah, newPost = $('article:first'); $("body").click(function() { newPost.attr('contenteditable', 'false'); says that newPost is undefined
[08:08:19] <shoky> ziyadb: what pachet said
[08:08:24] <Lexi> how would I get all the elements that include a certain css class and put them in a for loop, so I can put a delay between each animation
[08:08:42] <ziyadb> pachet: hmm, the newPost is defined inside another function. I omitted var to make it a global variable..
[08:09:20] <pachet> can we see the larger context?
[08:09:28] <shoky> omitting var doesn't necessarily make it global, and is bad practice anyway. pastebin
[08:10:45] <ziyadb> relevant code: http://pastebin.com/mqhFJYBX
[08:11:11] <shoky> let us decide what's relevant
[08:11:31] <shoky> are you even calling that createPost function ;]
[08:12:06] <pachet> https://gist.github.com/4444570
[08:12:33] <BillCriswell> Ugh.
[08:13:00] <shoky> eurmie
[08:13:01] <ziyadb> pachet: thanks, I'll try it :)
[08:13:05] <ziyadb> shoky: why of course! $('#createPost').click(createPost);
[08:14:50] <shoky> see, some more relevant code
[08:15:06] <sherlock-holmes> anyone needs a web developer for some cheep freelancing?
[08:15:39] <ziyadb> shoky: :P
[08:16:05] <fission6> anyone have a rec for a bookmarklet to add jquery to a page
[08:16:50] <sherlock-holmes> fission6 rec?
[08:16:59] <sampaka> i am looping a click(closelightbox()) function. and the first loop already triggers the click!
[08:17:13] <shoky> sampaka:  .click(closelightbox)
[08:17:32] <fission6> yea i keep getting generators
[08:17:41] <sampaka> sorry its .click(closelightbox(selectnumber));
[08:17:54] <shoky> sampaka: what does closelightbox return?
[08:17:59] <sampaka> the selectnumber is getting incremented each loop
[08:18:35] <sampaka> it sets the select option of a drop down menu when triggered
[08:18:51] <shoky> sampaka: .click(function() { closelightbox(selectnumber) })    and i hope your loop isn't a simple for loop..?
[08:19:13] <sampaka> ;) its a while loop! wrong?
[08:19:34] <shoky> sampaka:  you're calling closelightbox(selectnumber)  and passing the return value from that as an event handler to .click(...)
[08:19:56] <shoky> sampaka:  not wrong.. but might cause a problem
[08:20:43] <sampaka> i see
[08:20:58] <shoky> it'd help to see the loop itself
[08:21:01] <shoky> in a pastebin
[08:21:58] <shoky> or you can try .click( closelightbox.bind(null, selectnumber) )
[08:22:40] <shoky> ;S
[08:23:01] <sampaka> ok - i was trying the first solution u gave me but the selectnumber stays always the last value of the loop - now the second one
[08:23:07] <Stephen> Good morning jqueriables
[08:23:19] <shoky> sampaka: yep that's the problem i meant ;]
[08:25:06] <neybar_work> dumb question... how do I test if .find().first() returned any elements?  It always seems to return an object so I can't just test if (ele) {} or something.
[08:25:20] <shoky> neybar_work:  check the .length
[08:25:49] <sampaka> shoky: thanks a lot the second approach worked
[08:27:00] <sampaka> shoky: can you maybe explain me what is the concept behing .click( closelightbox.bind(null, selectnumber) - what did i wrong simply looping
[08:28:18] <shoky> sampaka: did you understand first of all why   .click(closelightbox(selectnumber))  is wrong?
[08:28:49] <ajpiano> sampaka: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide32
[08:28:56] <shoky> yay!
[08:29:03] <shoky> thanks ajp ;]
[08:29:08] <ajpiano> :)
[08:29:52] <Saaether> fixing these jquery doesnt even make sense
[08:29:53] <sampaka> shoky: not really
[08:30:08] <Saaether> poor domain name i think heh
[08:30:32] <ajpiano> Saaether: lol
[08:30:42] <ajpiano> hang out here long enough and you'll find it makes quite a deal of sense
[08:31:09] <shoky> sampaka:  closelightbox(selectnumber)   <-- this is a CALL to closelightbox, it calls the function
[08:31:32] <sampaka> ok it does not pass the argument
[08:31:41] <ziyadb> shoky: _still_ bitching about newPost. http://pastebin.com/aHJLwLTS
[08:31:54] <ziyadb> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'attr' of undefined  on line 24.
[08:31:55] <iman> shoky: how can i get text between <button>
[08:31:55] <shoky> sampaka:  so    .click( closelightbox(selectnumber) )    is the same as:   var bla = closelightbox(selectnumber);  something.click( bla );
[08:32:05] <iman> event.data dows not work
[08:32:07] <iman> does *
[08:32:27] <shoky> sampaka:  thats why when you did it, it called the function, instead of just passing it as an event handler
[08:32:37] <sampaka> i see!!
[08:33:08] <shoky> sampaka:  and the other issue is a bit more complicated, see ajpiano's link
[08:33:50] <sampaka> thanks a lot for pointing this out!
[08:34:03] <shoky> ;]
[08:35:39] <neybar_work> iman: $('button').html('some text')
[08:37:04] <iman> neybar_work: nope, i want to get text's value between button element
[08:38:10] <ziyadb> shoky: Oh, I didn't call the createPost function. That's why it's not defined!
[08:38:11] <ziyadb> Silly me.
[08:38:28] <shoky> ;p
[08:39:47] <deoxxa> can purpose for $.each use array.map function name?
[08:39:54] <shoky> iman:  $(this).text()
[08:40:08] <shoky> deoxxa: what?
[08:40:15] <shoky> deoxxa:  there's $.map too
[08:40:32] <naomi> if my load function in separate app.js file can jquery still load my code
[08:40:39] <deoxxa> as $.each for map operation similar?
[08:40:51] <iman> shoky: thanks dude
[08:41:09] <shoky> deoxxa:  .each and .map  are similar but different
[08:41:09] <fission6> i selected a bunch of links, how would i return an array of just the href values?
[08:41:39] <shoky> fission6: with .map
[08:41:41] <shoky> ?map
[08:41:42] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[08:42:00] <shoky> and at the end call .get()
[08:42:01] <naomi> deoxxa: do you mean using $.each in array.map? i think thats possible
[08:42:08] <naomi> deoxxa: javascript lets you nest loops
[08:42:28] <fission6> ok
[08:42:47] <deoxxa> for design vehicle display $.each can use map function name?
[08:43:06] <shoky> fission6: like:  $('.links').map(function(i, el) { return el.href }).get()
[08:43:08] <fission6> this worked $('div.topic_subject_container a').map(function(index, value) {return $(value).attr('href') } )
[08:43:17] <fission6> shoky: looks good too
[08:43:19] <shoky> fission6: or .attr('href') might be more suitable actually yeh
[08:43:34] <shoky> cause href prop and attr are a bit different iirc
[08:44:15] <deoxxa> jquery has intgerate googlemap ??
[08:44:32] <NoiseEee> deoxxa: nope
[08:45:13] <fabioportieri> how do i bind an event when an input field changes value? .change() doesn't seem to do the job
[08:45:20] <naomi> if my load function in separate app.js file can jquery still load my code
[08:45:46] <pmercado> I'm using jquery-ui, when I type some letters in my autocomplete form it display list correctly, but when I move mouse over list it disappear automatically, some have happened this before?
[08:46:16] <BLeg> fabioportieri: Is change() not reacting?
[08:46:36] <fabioportieri> BLeg: not as i want, moreover i change the value programmatically
[08:46:49] <fabioportieri> too
[08:47:07] <BLeg> fabioportieri: What is change() doing?
[08:47:16] <BLeg> fabioportieri: And what are you looking for it to do
[08:47:21] <fabioportieri> it fires when the input loses focus or something
[08:47:44] <shoky> fabioportieri:  'input' event will catch more things, but i dont think any DOM event will catch it when you programatically change it
[08:47:57] <fabioportieri> i want a function to be fired everytime user change that value directly and by other controls
[08:48:39] <fabioportieri> i'm tired :|
[08:49:00] <shoky> fabioportieri:  http://jsfiddle.net/wmLNb/
[08:49:10] <fabioportieri> i guess i will use keyup and look for keycode?
[08:49:18] <shoky> oops
[08:49:26] <shoky> fabioportieri: http://jsfiddle.net/wmLNb/1/
[08:49:45] <BLeg> fabioportieri: I thought change was correct there...
[08:50:14] <shoky> change only triggers when you blur the element or press enter
[08:50:17] <fabioportieri> never heard of the input event, interesting
[08:50:41] <BLeg> fabioportieri: I think shoky's fiddle is your answer, i forgot about that event
[08:51:56] <motka> riddle: who runs the whole world of today?
[08:52:09] <hlve> I DO.
[08:52:25] <shoky> i concur.
[08:52:30] <hlve> :)
[08:52:35] <motka> :D
[08:52:36] <motka> nah
[08:52:40] <motka> Apache Web Server
[08:52:47] <hlve> that wasn't funny.
[08:52:47] <hlve> :(
[08:52:50] <shoky> nope
[08:52:56] <shoky> that's serbian humor for you
[08:53:03] * Saaether yawns
[08:53:03] <shoky> motka you're the serb right ;]
[08:53:10] * hlve yawns at the non-funny.
[08:53:34] <motka> nah
[08:53:35] <motka> :D
[08:53:36] <fabioportieri> somehow i have trouble finding docs for that event
[08:53:39] <naomi> can i load jquery selector right from another function
[08:53:45] <motka> more to the west, but in the middle :D
[08:53:49] <shoky> fabioportieri: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/DOM_event_reference/input
[08:54:22] <shoky> oh damn, bosnia!
[08:54:28] <fabioportieri> thanks
[08:54:30] <shoky> sorry dude ;]
[08:54:52] <motka> yes
[08:54:54] <motka> :D
[08:54:55] <fabioportieri> aniway by default the change event should be triggered even when changing val dinamically, imo
[08:55:06] <fabioportieri> in the jquery core
[08:55:29] <shoky> fabioportieri:  you can call .change()  to trigger it
[08:55:44] <shoky> or .trigger('input')  if you want
[08:55:52] <fabioportieri> right
[08:55:59] <naomi> ok well well does jq work to get flash working on mobile site?
[08:56:51] <shoky> fabioportieri: or just call the handler yourself ;p
[08:59:15] <fabioportieri> this html5 stuff is backward compatible? :|
[09:02:40] <nfff> Yeh, valid html 4 is valid html5 but not always the otherway around of course :>
[09:06:19] <tw2113> valid html is valid, depends on what spec the validator is checking against
[09:07:52] <fabioportieri> i have to go bye guys
[09:15:26] <pmercado> I'm using jquery-ui, when I type some letters in my autocomplete form it display list correctly, but when I move mouse over list it disappear automatically, some have happened this before?
[09:15:28] <pmercado> anyone?
[09:15:44] <rindolf> pmercado: can you pastebot your code?
[09:17:35] <joel> I'm looking for a solid way to make forms in jquery, similar to extjs. Google seems to  indicate about a million different form plugins. Is there one known among the community to be exceptional, or the standard?
[09:19:09] <Rudeboy> If someone can help me with this, you'll be my hero!! What I'm trying to do is make the right arrows change to down arrows when the link is clicked. But ONLY the clicked link, not all the links. Here is the code: http://pastebin.com/SVtZEDpG
[09:36:14] <danielfilho|w> hey guys
[09:36:31] <danielfilho|w> i have a question about building a jquery supporting a few deprecated stuffs
[09:36:37] <danielfilho|w> could someone help me? :)
[09:39:50] <Saaether> danielfilho|w if you have a question ask it, and if some one is able to answer they will
[09:40:28] <danielfilho|w> oh, sorry
[09:44:15] <danielfilho|w> so, I have a problem with deprecated things here
[09:44:28] <danielfilho|w> specifically, with the old event handling versus the new way
[09:44:45] <codecowboy> i'm seeing a strange issue with a a slider value not incrementing when clicking a button which only happens on mobile webkit browsers, works fine on the desktop. are there known issues dealing with integers in JS on mobile browsers?
[09:44:54] <danielfilho|w> the matter is: we have millions of pages and a really rusty way to update it's tags.
[09:45:11] <codecowboy> the code uses nouislider, a jquery plugin ^^
[09:45:20] <danielfilho|w> so, I think I will need to have a custom build of jquery, to work with deprecated features
[09:45:38] <danielfilho|w> on this first time, and update the old scripts one by one
[09:45:48] <danielfilho|w> so I'd like to know the best way to do that
[10:02:16] <NoiseEee> danielfilho|w: keep an old version of jquery around for those old scripts?
[10:03:45] <NoiseEee> danielfilho|w: and what is old event handling vs the new way?  you mean using "on"?
[10:04:21] <hateIE> http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/jquery-code-smells/  <- jokes -- see Arnold Hansen's comments hah
[10:05:57] <danielfilho|w> NoiseEee: I just fixed it replacing "bind()" instead of "on()"
[10:05:59] <danielfilho|w> this works for now
[10:06:11] <danielfilho|w> but I will need to dig deep into old stuffs here :/
[10:06:16] <NoiseEee> but why are you updating at all danielfilho|w?
[10:06:18] <danielfilho|w> lucky it has the same syntax
[10:06:40] <danielfilho|w> the company I work just broke the contract with the video supplier
[10:06:46] <danielfilho|w> and we've made our on platform
[10:06:55] <danielfilho|w> the supplier used jq 1.4.4
[10:07:09] <danielfilho|w> we support all the latest things, so things got a little broken
[10:07:34] <NoiseEee> yeah uh good luck with that
[10:07:59] <danielfilho|w> thanks NoiseEee. I'm sure I'll need! :)
[10:16:28] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/13/ <-- How do i get same width on the 4 lines
[10:19:27] <Whiskey> shoky: :D
[10:23:39] <BillCriswell> How do you guys handle lots of passwords at your job? Is there something web based?
[10:23:59] <andrewhl> Can someone explain why someone would do the following: https://gist.github.com/4445615
[10:24:14] <andrewhl> I'm unclear on the difference between Array.max, and Array.prototype.max
[10:24:29] <rindolf> BillCriswell: hi.
[10:24:35] <rindolf> BillCriswell: I'm using gringotts.
[10:24:45] <rindolf> BillCriswell: I think there are web-based password managers.
[10:25:01] <rindolf> BillCriswell: gringotts is using gtk+ though.
[10:25:07] <Whiskey> you see that rows in my example not equal sized
[10:29:45] <shoky> Whiskey: http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/18/
[10:29:46] <shoky> :\
[10:31:27] <Whiskey> thats correct
[10:31:31] <Whiskey> one error left
[10:31:37] <Whiskey> if you look at your 18
[10:32:33] <shoky> ?
[10:32:34] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/19/ <--- look at that one, how do we make it width after something other if its widther then the text
[10:33:49] <Whiskey> as it need to find the offSetWidth i think or whatever its called
[10:34:01] <shoky> can you ask again.. in english ;]
[10:35:11] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/19/ you see that one the border is bigger then the rows, its just cuz the text in EndBox2 is larger then the text in the InfoViewBox
[10:35:22] <Whiskey> So how to make the rows larger if any other border is larger
[10:35:32] <shoky> eh
[10:35:39] <shoky> learn jquery ;]
[10:35:57] <Whiskey> hehe culd take ages
[10:36:05] <shoky> and then, understand my code
[10:36:25] <shoky> and then you're set ;p
[10:37:01] <shoky> and stop putting display:table on shit :(
[10:37:23] <grafi> and start using tables again ^^
[10:37:46] <Whiskey> that makes it more adjustible shoky
[10:38:07] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/FwDbr/1/ <-- that what happens whitout it
[10:39:36] <Whiskey> actully it just need to know the width of InfoViewBox to get correct if its bigger then the widthest span
[10:39:40] <shoky> i remember a fiddle i made you much earlier that had it all workin fine with no mention of tables
[10:40:23] <Whiskey> i don´t use tables
[10:40:26] <shoky> anyway, good luck getting help with  a layout that depends on display:table on <body>
[10:40:29] <shoky> same shit
[10:40:54] <Whiskey> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/8/ <-- that one
[10:41:37] <Whiskey> shoky: the table just make everything on the page have same width. im not sure why you so against it
[10:42:08] <shoky> Whiskey: the main reason i'm against it is because i don't understand it myself.
[10:42:41] <shoky> Whiskey: and since you've been looking for help with it all day, and only getting a no-tables solution from me,
[10:43:18] <Whiskey> shoky: let me show why i use it
[10:43:19] <shoky> i doubt many others understand it too great, or are willing to deal with it and try to help you with it
[10:43:23] <Whiskey> we go back to your 8
[10:43:34] <Whiskey> toy don´t need two shoky
[10:43:49] <shoky> just cause you'll find a scenario where table solves it,
[10:44:00] <shoky> doesn't mean it's the only way, or a good way
[10:44:26] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/18/ <-- need to know if InfoViewBox width is bigger then the width of the text, if then maker it grow as the width of the InfoViewBox shuld not be harder then that
[10:44:35] <Whiskey> shoky: prob true
[10:45:13] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/20/ <-- that what happens whitout table
[10:45:30] <Whiskey> as soon you add table, the width of everything worksespect the one you fixed for me
[10:46:49] <grafi> hm
[10:47:18] <ab2qik> hi all, i have the following link: http://jq/consol-test/rotate-swede/index.html
[10:47:28] <grafi> are you sure this isnt actually a case where a normal table would be a fitting solution Whiskey?
[10:48:16] <ab2qik> the images are navigable, but ajax search not working properly?
[10:48:26] <Whiskey> shoky: you know im right
[10:50:00] <ab2qik> any ideas anyone?
[10:51:27] <BillCriswell> rindolf: That's for the suggestion.
[10:51:34] <shoky> Whiskey: http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/21/
[10:51:36] <grafi> link doesnt seem to be working ab2qik?
[10:51:50] <rindolf> BillCriswell: I think there are better ones now.
[10:51:55] <rindolf> Maybe I should switch.
[10:52:34] <BillCriswell> I came across a nice web based one that we could put on an intranet. I'm just not a security guy so I'm not sure how safe it would be to use.
[10:52:34] <Whiskey> not same size shoky
[10:52:44] <shoky> Whiskey: http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/22/
[10:53:02] <ab2qik> grafi: i just clicked through to it?
[10:53:11] <BillCriswell> https://www.simplesafe.net/ is the one I came across. The demo was pretty nice.
[10:53:36] <shoky> Whiskey: and you can remove display: inline-block  from #container
[10:53:46] <shoky> it can stay block
[10:53:52] <BillCriswell> If it has a salt and is two way encrypted is that at least kind of safe?
[10:54:25] <Whiskey> aaa you did it that way dunno if thats a good way
[10:54:33] <Whiskey> but it sure does what i asked fore
[10:58:16] <Whiskey> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/24/ <-- why you shuld caluclate it in JS
[10:59:12] <shoky> Whiskey: uh, what behaviour are you looking for there?
[10:59:16] <Whiskey> Anyways im off and thx alot shoky :)
[10:59:28] <Whiskey> just show that if its smaller then the other box it won´t know just bigger :)
[10:59:28] <shoky> seeya ;p
[10:59:35] <Whiskey> cya :D
[10:59:43] <shoky> but what behaviour are you looking for
[10:59:45] <shoky> is what i asked ;]
[11:00:11] <raj> wutup shoky? Happy new year brother
[11:00:41] <shoky> heyo raj. happy happies~~
[11:01:02] <shoky> sup
[11:01:11] <raj> nothing much, working the night shift today
[11:01:44] <shoky> saving lives!
[11:01:57] <shoky> or bladders maybe
[11:02:00] <raj> if it's too busy, I just let them go
[11:02:14] <raj> depends how people in #css treat me
[11:02:34] <shoky> heh
[11:28:23] <Jzarecta> hi I got a datepicker but the calendar view is way too big
[11:28:31] <Jzarecta> is there a way to make it smaller without much hacking?
[11:28:38] <Jzarecta> I am using jquery-ui latest
[11:28:57] <Jzarecta> 1.9.2
[11:29:25] <Jzarecta> what I want is the calendar pop-up to make it look smaller than what it currently appears?
[11:31:35] <devkinetic> Hello, I just bought a plugin that uses v1.8 but my website is limited to 1.3.2 what can I do?
[11:32:57] <NoiseEee> devkinetic: cry / search for another plugin / consider updating your site every few years
[11:33:29] <shoky_> Jzarecta: lower the font-size for the ui widges  e.g. put this in your css file:   #mycontainer .ui-widget { font-size: 0.7em }
[11:33:40] <shoky_> ui widgets*
[11:33:55] <Jzarecta> shoky_ should I edit the jquery-ui.css?
[11:33:59] <shoky_> Jzarecta: hell no
[11:34:15] <shoky_> Jzarecta: in your own css
[11:34:26] <devkinetic> NoiseEee: Fair enough. this is what I need. maybe i could downgrade it i'm decent at jquery. I'm using drupal 6 so I'd have to upgrade our whole platform
[11:34:32] <shoky_> Jzarecta:  jqueryui.com for example, just has font-size: 62.5%    on <body>
[11:35:03] <devkinetic> I guess a better question is, is there documentation listing changes that i can use to dowgrade my code
[11:36:04] <sendoushi> can anyone tell me what happens when i use slidetoggle to the css?
[11:36:05] <NoiseEee> devkinetic: i think there are change logs but 1.3.2 is downright ancient
[11:36:31] <NoiseEee> devkinetic: coming up on 4 years.  which is an eterrrrrrrrnity on the web
[11:36:52] <shoky_> devkinetic: i bet the time you spend downgrading the plugin will be worth much more than the plugin cost ;]
[11:39:10] <sendoushi> can anyone tell me what happens to the css with the hide and the slidetoggle?
[11:39:18] <Saaether> thats what i tell my boss when he tries to get me to modify old classic asp code, not even worth the trouble. heh
[11:39:51] <devkinetic> NoiseEee: tell me about it. my employer always wants new flashy stuff hard to impliment things
[11:40:12] <hunda> dev: most do, then they hear how long thats going to take
[11:40:18] <hunda> 'forget it, make it work in 4 hours then'
[11:41:28] <Jzarecta> shoky_ thing is that jquery inserts it directly on the div style atribute
[11:41:44] <Jzarecta> shoky_ so even in my css it wont read it since the element style has priority
[11:42:10] <hunda> http://cumberlandcreativegroup.com/ after the carousel there's a small calendar widget that has links on the days which have events.. the first link works as intended (colorbox), the rest load up in a new window
[11:42:19] <hunda> ideas/hints/clues/hold my hand plz
[11:42:21] <Jzarecta> shoky_ my html spew it like this: <div id="ui-datepicker-div" class="ui-datepicker ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-helper-clearfix ui-corner-all ui-datepicker-multi ui-datepicker-multi-2" style="position: absolute; left: 531px; z-index: 1; width: 34em; top: 456px; display: block;">
[11:42:23] <shoky_> Jzarecta:  jquery inserts what on the div style attribute?
[11:42:36] <shoky_> Jzarecta: so what? there's no font-size there
[11:42:51] <Jzarecta> shoky_ I am talking about z-index
[11:42:56] <shoky_> huh.
[11:43:05] <Jzarecta> I want to modify the z-index of the datepicker
[11:43:15] <shoky_> that's not what you said before...
[11:43:18] <Saaether> you were asking about size before not z-index o.O
[11:43:19] <shoky_> at all ;p
[11:43:35] <MistuhKurtz> wow, you really need to optimize that site hunda
[11:43:47] <MistuhKurtz> I'm on a crazy fast connection and it took forever to download
[11:43:50] <hunda> mistuh, it's on a 400k uplink
[11:43:53] <hunda> its development
[11:44:17] <Jzarecta> shoky_ you are right, sorry, so can you help?
[11:44:22] <MistuhKurtz> still, your clouds png is 1mb
[11:44:24] <Saaether> its like being on dialup again lol
[11:44:37] <hunda> mistuh, yea, but it looks good lol
[11:45:05] <hunda> it has a transparency to it, that i need to turn into a white background i kno
[11:45:43] <hunda> prolly doesnt help that like 3 or 4 people just loaded it up
[11:45:46] <hunda> either
[11:46:42] <shoky> Jzarecta: well one way is to use !important :\
[11:47:16] <shoky> Jzarecta: i guess that's what you should do..
[11:47:53] <alaing> hi does anyone know of a good tutorial on custom events?
[11:48:47] <hunda> wow, i'm retarded? can't use multiple elements with an "id" tag, gotta use class
[11:48:56] * hunda hangs his head in shame.
[11:51:25] <shoky> Jzarecta: i also see you can put position:relative; z-index: 1234;   on the <input> for the datepicker
[11:59:41] <Jzarecta> shoky I did use important, still gets ignored, and by input you mean? The JS?
[11:59:59] <Jzarecta> one second, coffe time
[12:00:21] <bytephilia> hello
[12:00:25] <shoky> still gets ignored..? then i think you did something wrong.  and no i mean the <input> element
[12:01:06] <bytephilia> http://goo.gl/JqntH please try clicking the video. don't you think the last part of the animation is a bit rough?
[12:02:38] <hunda> it'd look better if it expanded while moving into position
[12:02:44] <hunda> also, ???'s at the bottom are weird
[12:03:19] <hunda> well, middle, really
[12:04:02] <shoky> yea something is off there
[12:04:05] <bytephilia> haha they are not my creation but thanks for the tip
[12:04:50] <bytephilia> is it not expanding while moving?
[12:05:05] <bytephilia> I was trying to make it appear as if it was expanding in all directions (not just right and down)
[12:06:07] <alaing> hi can anyone here recommend a good tutorial on custom events.
[12:06:18] <alaing> The reason I'm asking is because I would like to provide a means for a developer to run their own custom function within my plugin
[12:10:03] <sonotos> alaing: http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-custom-events-they-will-rock-your-world/
[12:10:11] <drupol> Hi there,
[12:10:56] <drupol> I'm looking for a way to parse html (that I get from an ajax request) with a jquery selector and find all the tr having the class 'export'.
[12:11:15] <drupol> $(html).find('tr.export') doesn't work.
[12:11:40] <alaing> thanks sonotos, I'llwork through that and see if it all starts making sense.
[12:12:22] <drupol> drupol: any idea to help ?
[12:12:23] <sonotos> alaing: you shoud also have a look at jquery.ui.widget they have many custom events there
[12:12:40] <ziyadb> Hi guys!
[12:12:47] * hlve slaps ziyadb around a bit with a large trout
[12:13:18] <ziyadb> So I have a bunch of elements with some content. I would like to select them and make them into JSON format so I can send them to a server..
[12:13:28] <alaing> sonotos: does it do custom binding?
[12:13:46] <imass> hi guys, how can I delete td's button after click in Edit, http://jsfiddle.net/dBz66/2/
[12:13:52] <ziyadb> For example, $('article') <- select article element. The next steps are to retrieve its content and make them to JSON.
[12:13:54] <ziyadb> But HOW?!
[12:13:57] <sonotos> drupol: try it with a documentFragment http://ejohn.org/blog/dom-documentfragments/
[12:14:32] <Es0teric> is it possible to get a gallery aspx site in json format? if so, how can you do it?
[12:14:58] <sonotos> alaing: well they have serveral custom events, just read the documentation and the code
[12:15:15] <ziyadb> imass: http://jsfiddle.net/dBz66/3/
[12:15:22] <sonotos> even if you don't want to use it, maybe it provides some example code for a better understanding
[12:15:47] <ziyadb> So it's a pretty simple question. Make element and its content to JSON.
[12:15:50] <ziyadb> Just can't figure it out.
[12:16:00] <imass> ziyadb: thanks
[12:16:06] <ziyadb> imass: np.
[12:25:01] <BillCriswell> ziyadb: Look into serializeArray();
[12:25:36] <ziyadb> BillCriswell: thanks, I'll check it out. Otherwise I'll just iterate through the array manually and just index them.
[12:25:52] <BillCriswell> ziyadb: That'll work too. I think serializeArray() only works on inputs.
[12:26:16] <BillCriswell> returns like [{name: "first", value: "Bill"]}
[12:26:28] <BillCriswell> }] *
[12:26:28] <JoeSlack> well, it works on any form type
[12:26:38] <JoeSlack> generally, you'd want to serialize an entire form
[12:26:43] <BillCriswell> Yeah.
[12:27:00] <BillCriswell> You could pick and choose which you'd like as well, though.
[12:27:07] <JoeSlack> yep, definitely
[12:27:14] <JoeSlack> I usually do that on the server side tho :)
[12:27:38] <ziyadb> BillCriswell: heh, I hope it works. What I'm trying to do is fairly simple.
[12:28:01] <BillCriswell> Yeah, there's always that, too.
[12:29:32] <DUMONT_> how do i find if my ele object is an image? var ele = $(element).children('img');
[12:30:09] <ziyadb> BillCriswell: this seems pretty redundant though.
[12:30:28] <BillCriswell> el.nodeName should do it.
[12:30:43] <ziyadb> I mean since I already have a JSON array, I don't think it's really a good idea to copy it into an object or another array.
[12:32:10] <BillCriswell> zDog: You can also do $('ele').is('img')
[12:37:00] <sukima> alaing: ... and the order in which the browser takes toys out is up for debate.
[12:37:09] <alaing> sukima: so u should call .on() before using .trigger?
[12:37:23] <katsh> http://jsfiddle.net/6dYJq/ why does body get focus and not the outer div?
[12:37:54] <sukima> alaing: yes. in jQuery you can think of it as the trigger will be the announcement that something happened and the on is saying hey when that happens do something.
[12:38:37] <sukima> You can trigger all you like but untill an on is associated nothing will happen
[12:41:30] <alaing> sukima : ok I have a plugin that builds a jQuery UI Tab and adds bits and pieces to the tabs. I what to fire an event called myFinishedTabs so if other developers would like to hook in and add their own custom code that gets added afterwards they would use .on('myFinishedTabs',function(){blah})?
[12:43:32] <sukima> alaing: then in your pluggin just use trigger. ( maybe $(this).trigger("myPlugin.customEvent"); then the user can use on anytime they wish.
[12:44:25] <alaing> does the .on have to be applied to the element? example say i had $('#foo').trigger('myFinishedTab'); Would I then need to hook into it using $('#foo').on('myFinishedTabs', etc) or could they use say $('#bar').on(etc)?
[12:44:44] <alaing> assuming $('#bar') is #foo parent
[12:45:00] <NoiseEee> alaing: in that case, putting it on #bar is fine
[12:45:17] <NoiseEee> as things bubble up, and you're starting to get into the concept of event delegation
[12:45:29] <alaing> so .on() is really just adding a listerning write?
[12:45:33] <alaing> write=right?
[12:45:46] <sukima> alaing: your talking a plugin so you don't want to hard code the element ID. You probubly want $(this)
[12:45:53] <alaing> .trigger is broadcasting an event out
[12:45:53] <b-ot> alaing, memorised “trigger”.
[12:46:00] <sukima> alaing: yes on is just adding a listener
[12:46:15] <alaing> oh now I get it :-)
[12:46:55] <alaing> thanks sukima very much appreciated your help this evening
[12:47:01] <sukima> glad to help
[12:47:36] <alaing> I only used to using .delegate and listening for standard browser events but I can see this is going to change my programing a lot
[12:48:30] <alaing> out of interest what does older jquery have a .on equilant?
[12:48:35] <systemfault> alaing: Since 1.7, the jquery guys merged all event handling functions into a single one, .on which has two syntaxes
[12:48:41] <alaing> I have one project thats still on 1.4
[12:49:00] <sukima> alaing: yes: bind and live
[12:49:27] <alaing> I suppose I could also use .delegate
[12:49:40] <sukima> Or upgrade
[12:49:56] <systemfault> .delegate is a bit like .live (Both do event delegation)
[12:49:56] <b-ot> systemfault, memorised “delegate”.
[12:50:03] <systemfault> Sorry :(
[12:50:14] <systemfault> I didn't want to mess with the both
[12:50:32] <systemfault> .delegate
[12:50:38] <systemfault> !delegate
[12:50:39] <b-ot> systemfault, a bit like .live (Both do event delegation)
[12:50:49] <alaing> the important part is .trigger() to broadcast it. for some reason Ididn't quiet understand what .trigger did but its clear as day now
[12:50:49] <sukima> LOLz!!!
[12:51:17] <alaing> sukima: I do have it planned for sometime this year :-)
[12:51:28] <sukima> does the bot have a revert feature?
[12:52:09] <alaing> I perfer .delegate over .live because one of my old applicaiton have very deep doms and I had quiet a bit of performance issues with using .live
[12:52:43] <systemfault> .delegate is Older/Non-recommended way to do event delegation with jQuery. For new projects, use the second form of .on, .on(event, selector, handler) instead.
[12:52:43] <b-ot> systemfault, memorised “delegate”.
[12:52:58] <NoiseEee> .delegate?
[12:53:07] <NoiseEee> `delegate?
[12:53:14] <systemfault> NoiseEee: I messed up the both without wanting it..
[12:53:16] <systemfault> *bot
[12:53:21] <NoiseEee> smelligate
[12:53:33] <systemfault> Not sure if the bot had an entry for .delegate before.
[12:53:33] <sukima> LOLz again systemfault !!
[12:53:45] <alaing> lol
[12:54:04] <alaing> thanks guys.....
[12:54:08] <sukima> then again having a bot listen for .commands seems silly in a language that uses . notation.
[12:54:08] <drupol> sonotos: thanks !
[12:54:22] <systemfault> sukima: That one was on purpose...  :/
[12:54:37] <drupol> I'm also looking for help on how to do multiple ajax calls and I want the return value to be added to a variable... see: http://jsbin.com/akeyah/1/edit
[12:56:23] <systemfault> drupol: Make the getAllYears function take a callback and call it from inside the function when you got all the "years"
[12:57:27] <systemfault> Also, it doesn't make sense to me to return anything for onload:
[12:57:35] <drupol> systemfault: ok I'll try... do you have an example ?
[12:57:37] <drupol> ok
[12:58:26] <systemfault> I could write an example bit it would probably not work (untested)
[12:58:58] <drupol> okay
[12:59:39] <drupol> you can edit my code in jsbin
[13:00:00] <systemfault> Also, if you declare a variable without the var keyword in front of it, you're create global variables (bad)
[13:03:38] <drupol> oki
[13:03:58] <systemfault> I was away... give me a minute
[13:05:12] <drupol> Take your time, no hurry :)
[13:07:31] <systemfault> How do I save with jsbin?
[13:07:48] <drupol> automatically :)
[13:08:01] <systemfault> Then take a look at it now.
[13:08:09] <drupol> okay I see
[13:08:15] <drupol> callback(e.responseText)
[13:08:17] <systemfault> It should give you an idea of how to work with async code
[13:08:21] <drupol> I see that
[13:08:28] <drupol> Thanks a lot systemfault :)
[13:09:40] <systemfault> In the future, you could learn how to work with promise objects to make the code nicer but it's a good start
[13:09:49] <drupol> ok
[13:09:50] <systemfault> Just make sure you declare your variables with the var keyword
[13:12:40] <GoSox> how can i use .prepend() to add items to a list, but also use .slideDown() so those items come in, in a nice animated way?
[13:12:48] <Lindrian> Stephen: you there friend?
[13:12:58] <drupol> systemfault: which one in particular in my example?
[13:17:26] <imass> how can i remove 4 first elements from foo element?
[13:17:51] <imass> http://jsfiddle.net/NNQnu/1/
[13:18:35] <innociv__> https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/07/using-indexeddb-api-today-the-indexeddb-polyfills/ Erm.. so what happens if someone was using an old browser that only supports webSQL, or used setVersion instead of onupgradeneeded, and then their browser is upgraded to support those?...
[13:26:44] <shiftins> would/should creating a nested tab trigger the tabshow event on the parent tab control?
[13:26:56] <shiftins> *tabbshow
[13:27:04] <shiftins> *ugh
[13:30:03] <aaairc> Is anyone here familiar with the Youtube JSON API? I just posted a question here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14147424/youtube-api-callback-passthrough-for-json-in-script asking whether it is possible to passthrough a variable with the callback parameter
[13:31:01] <shiftins> fyi YouTube not Youtube
[13:31:10] <shiftins> shoot me, i know :D
[13:33:52] <andrewhl> shiftins: "I" is capitalized. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muphry%27s_law
[13:52:20] <Lindrian> If anyone can help I'd be awesome: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14147857/how-do-i-detect-any-change-to-a-textarea
[13:52:57] <drupol> systemfault: I can get it working with the callback but I still do not get what I want, the variable at the end of the function is always empty :(
[13:53:02] <drupol> *can't
[13:56:11] <drupol> Someone can help with ajax and closures ? See: http://jsbin.com/akeyah/5/edit
[13:56:18] <GoSox> so I have a UL with an id, and when i do a .length on that ID, i get 1, no matter how many LI's I add to that UL
[13:56:25] <GoSox>  $("#menu_stream_list").length
[13:58:23] <aaairc> shiftins: are you familiar with the youtube api?
[13:58:25] <systemfault> drupol: Of course it's empty... because it is at the time your console.log is called.
[13:58:41] <systemfault> drupol: You need to familiarize yourself with async code.
[13:58:42] <jb_mission> GoSox: you probably are looking for $("#menu_stream_list li").length
[13:59:01] <drupol> systemfault: I'm sure there's a way to get over it using async code no ?
[13:59:05] <jb_mission> You're getting one because your selector is only ever returning one element- the <ul> itself
[13:59:30] <GoSox> hmm
[13:59:40] <systemfault> drupol: The pseudo code I made for you does it... getAllYears takes a callback which is called once I get all the years.
[14:00:11] <systemfault> drupol: async calls are not blocking.
[14:00:52] <drupol> Yep, so this code is not good ? http://jsbin.com/akeyah/10/edit
[14:01:14] <drupol> I mean, I'm using a callback, but am I using it the right way ?
[14:01:24] <systemfault> Nope, because when console.log(output); is called, the ajax transaction hasn't started yet.
[14:01:48] <drupol> ho... ok
[14:01:59] <drupol> Damn...
[14:02:20] <systemfault> drupol: You seem to use the callback just fine for getAllYear, but not for getAllYears
[14:03:15] <drupol> omg I just saw your edit on jsbin !!
[14:03:18] <rook2pawn> is there a way to copy the inline style attribute and apply it to another element?
[14:03:27] <drupol> I'll implement it now.
[14:04:21] <systemfault> rook2pawn var style = $(sourceElementSelector).attr('style'); $(destinationElementSelector).attr('style', style); should do it.
[14:05:18] <rook2pawn> ahh nice! thanks
[14:08:52] <rook2pawn> works great
[14:09:50] <drupol> many thanks systemfault
[14:09:53] <drupol> systemfault++
[14:18:09] <blez> how to get element's text with newlines?
[14:18:16] <blez> .text() replaces <br> with ""
[14:22:21] * blez somebody?
[14:23:16] <tw2113> .html() maybe
[14:23:24] <BillCriswell> .text() returns the new lines.
[14:25:03] <blez> it replaces <br> with \n?
[14:26:22] <BillCriswell> No. <br> would not be in text.
[14:27:43] <BillCriswell> $('div').html(function(i, val){ return val.replace('<br>', '\n') }); maybe?
[14:28:42] <zitter|mobile> what's difference betweeb 'success' and 'complete' in $.ajax() I didn't understand well from doc
[14:29:11] <d4rklit3> hey
[14:29:16] <d4rklit3> has anyone ever used this: https://github.com/Ovea/cors
[14:29:23] <BillCriswell> $('div').html(function(i, val){ return val.replace(/<br>/g, '\n') }); should work.
[14:29:41] <BillCriswell> porn.xml, nice.
[14:30:28] <d4rklit3> it has stuff for setting headers on your xdr requests, but xdr doesn't even support them, i don't know why thats there
[14:31:22] <blez> BillCriswell I think that doesn't work
[14:31:29] <blez> $(e.target).html(function(i, val){ return val.replace('<br>', '\n') }).text(); that's what I got
[14:32:47] <BillCriswell> blez: Check out the console here: http://jsbin.com/ukoyur/1/edit
[14:33:49] <blez> ok, how to do that replace without actually modifing the element
[14:33:53] <blez> .clone()?
[14:34:01] <meckanism> does someone know how could i get hold of an element when he is inserted in the dom ?
[14:34:12] <meckanism> without using livequery
[14:34:18] <BillCriswell> If you want the HTML in a variable you would do var brToNewLine = $(e.target).html().replace(/<br>/g, '\n');
[14:34:46] <blez> I want the text, no tags, just want it multiline
[14:34:52] <GoSox> i made a page on my site today, that displays a nice animated stream of my site's traffic, so you can see in practically real time, what visitors are looking at
[14:34:59] <BillCriswell> That's what I'm giving you.
[14:35:01] <jjjoel> Hi all. Anybody know about using jQuery w/ Dojo?
[14:35:02] <GoSox> what i've discovered is, i don't have enough visitors :(
[14:35:21] <ryanneufeld> jjjoel: nope, no one
[14:35:30] <meckanism> jjjoel:if you're using one of them you wont need the other
[14:35:34] <blez> BillCriswell but .html() can have other tags in it, right?
[14:35:42] <blez> not only <br>
[14:35:50] <jjjoel> I've inherited a site w/ dojo, but I don't know it. I know jQuery
[14:35:50] <BillCriswell> blez: You didn't say that.
[14:36:12] <BillCriswell> blez: So you want the <br>s replace with new lines and everything else removed?
[14:36:19] <blez> yes
[14:36:28] <blez> and I want it in a var, without changing the element
[14:36:33] <suppp> guys if i have $('form#my_form_id') will this always return an array of objects ? i would expect the form object to be returned but instead it seems to be returning an array of objects
[14:36:39] <jjjoel> I can get simple jQuery to work, e.g. $('#id').css('color','red')...
[14:36:53] <jjjoel> but anything more complex and I get a blank page
[14:37:42] <BillCriswell> var brsToNewLinesAndHtmlRemoved = $(e.target).replace(/<br>/g, '\n').replace(/</?[^>]+>/g, '');
[14:37:52] <BillCriswell> I fee like I may die. I should probably go home.
[14:37:59] <blez> what if I clone() before everything?
[14:38:39] <suppp> can somebody confirm please ? a query such as $('') always returns a collection of objects , even if ure querying for a unique id ?
[14:38:40] <jjjoel> I've tried jQuery.noConflict(); but that didn't help
[14:39:12] <blez> looks like .clone() works
[14:39:24] <BillCriswell> blez: You lost me, but ok. Glad it works.
[14:39:46] <BillCriswell> suppp: You have a console, you can type code in there.
[14:40:42] <blez> thanks
[14:40:44] <suppp> BillCriswell: not sure what you mean ? I have tested this with firebug and it seems that a collection is being returned. I am just asking to be 100% sure that , i should be expecting a collection all the time
[14:41:34] <meckanism> is it possible with jquery live to watch for an inserted dom element ?
[14:41:38] <BillCriswell> suppp: jQuery always returns an array. When you do $('#foo') it returns an rray of one item.
[14:41:54] <suppp> BillCriswell : ok thanks for the confirmation
[14:41:56] <blez> do elements have unique id? how can I check if element is different from another one which looks the same?
[14:42:23] <BillCriswell> blez: They should, but you can get away with it usually.
[14:43:10] <jjjoel> ok, anybody know why a little basic jQuery code might cause a page to not load anything?
[14:43:18] <blez> maybe I can compare the e.target?
[14:43:23] <BillCriswell> blez: You can do $(el1)[0] === $(el2)[0]
[14:43:38] <akkufomk> hey I have a nested unordered list.  using jsTree.  when I do var xz = $(e).find('ul').children('li'); it returns me EVERYTHING under that node.  What's the selector to only get the LI's from under the current UL I'm parsing
[14:48:17] <jrockjiggz> hi, does anyone know how to avoid error (cannot set val() of none) when using: $('#cropX').val(c.x)
[14:48:50] <jrockjiggz> ( $('#cropX').length ) ? $('#cropX').val() : null; ?
[14:50:01] <BillCriswell> kenperkins: The only thing I can imagine is custom events that's triggered when an element might have been added.
[14:50:30] <kenperkins> eh?
[14:51:10] <jrockjiggz> hmm cannot read property length of null
[14:51:12] <MistuhKurtz> jrockjiggz, $('#crop').val(function(){ return (this.length) ? c.x : false; });
[14:51:22] <jrockjiggz> oh nice :)
[14:51:44] <jrockjiggz> thanks
[14:52:04] <MistuhKurtz> yeah I've taken to using anonymous functions with returns for setting things quite often now :D np
[14:56:51] <BillCriswell> kenperkins: I'm an idiot.
[14:56:59] <BillCriswell> It took me the longest time to realize I typed the wrong name in.
[14:57:11] <BillCriswell> meckanism: The only thing I can imagine is custom events that's triggered when an element might have been added.
[14:57:27] <firstclassfunc> is it possible to perform a non-ajax POST and send JSON string? What is the standard way to do s?
[14:57:28] <firstclassfunc> do so *
[14:58:11] <jrockjiggz> MistuhKurtz: its setting value="false" on the element.. $$$('#cropX').val(function(){ return (this.length) ? 'good' : 'bad' });
[14:58:27] <BillCriswell> firstclassfunc: You mean <a href="/foo.json"></a> ?
[14:58:42] <kenperkins> BillCriswell: aren't we all? :D
[14:58:49] <jrockjiggz> something about this.length isnt working
[14:59:29] <jrockjiggz> so weird..
[14:59:31] <firstclassfunc> BillCriswell: I'm asking a way to perform a form submit using POST and send a json string
[14:59:51] <firstclassfunc> I could put the json string as the form parameter "json"
[15:00:08] <BillCriswell> firstclassfunc: You said non-ajax.
[15:00:24] <blez> BillCriswell just another thing. How to check if the element is bold text, and if it's bold text to return the parent?
[15:01:55] <BillCriswell> You can do var $form = $('form'); $.post($form.attr('action'), $form.serializeArray());
[15:02:23] <BillCriswell> blez: You can test what $(this).css('fontWeight'); returns
[15:02:42] <firstclassfunc> BillCriswell: hmm, I meant without an xmlhttprequest or whatever. I still want to transmit a json string because its easier to marshall and unmarshall data
[15:03:18] <BillCriswell> The only way you can "send" it really without an XMLHttpRequest is by visiting the URL.
[15:05:23] <BillCriswell> <form action="woo.php" method="post"><input type="hidden" name="data" value="{\"foo\":\"bar\"}"> If this form is submitted it'll send the data </form>
[15:05:46] <firstclassfunc> BillCriswell: yeah, I'm looking for what the most standard way. I suppose it's just what you said
[15:06:55] <BillCriswell> firstclassfunc: Good luck! I have to run. Have a good one.
[15:13:57] <MistuhKurtz> jrockjiggz, still having problems?
[15:14:01] <MistuhKurtz> set up a jsfiddle
[15:14:12] <MistuhKurtz> I'm beginning to think you might have multiple elements with the same ID
[15:14:20] <Jamezor> am I using the .getJSON method properly? https://gist.github.com/4448402
[15:16:50] <__machine> how can i preventDefault only for a short period of time, and then continue?
[15:18:15] <NivenHuH> is something fucked with jsfiddle?
[15:18:38] <NivenHuH> it's not loading external resources
[15:21:37] <monk3y> __machine: when/what events make you want to preventDefault, and then when do you want to let default actions continue?
[15:22:39] <__machine> monk3y: i want to debounce the default action (not a callback function)
[15:22:55] <monk3y> Uh.
[15:22:58] <monk3y> Debounce?
[15:23:25] <__machine> yes... prevent multiple execution or delay execution
[15:25:47] <monk3y> Uh .. if you're just talking about 'preventDefault', then I know the function you're talking about, and what it does.  My question was; when do you want to switch it off, and when do you want to let events through again?  Can you identify events that you can monitor to trigger these states?
[15:27:34] <__machine> i want to re-enable it in an anonymous function with setTimeout ... e.g. .on('click', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); setTimeout(function() { e.trigger(); }, 1000); }); ... something like this?
[15:31:45] <monk3y> Are you doing this generically for many different events, or is it just for a submit button?
[15:32:07] <__machine> can i do $(e.target).trigger(e.type); inside the timeout function? or will that cause an endless loop?
[15:33:11] <monk3y> I'm not 100% sure (and hopefully someone more knowledgeable chimes-in), but I don't think preventDefault works the way you think it does.
[15:33:23] <monk3y> As in I don't think it's a flood-gate that you close-then-open.
[15:33:26] <__machine> maybe i can re-trigger the same event like this but also pass some extra data that will allow the second execution... $(e.target).trigger(e.type, {allow: true}) ? and in the main event handler... if (!e.data.allow) { e.preventDefault(); setTimeout... ?
[15:33:37] <sheilablackrose> hi guys
[15:33:44] <monk3y> Yo sheila.
[15:34:17] <__machine> i know preventDefault doesnt work that way (cant be paused and re-enabled)... which is why im asking how to work around it :D
[15:34:36] <monk3y> Heh gotcha.
[15:34:55] <monk3y> Again I have to ask; is this for a certain class/many different events, or just for a submit button?
[15:35:26] <monk3y> Because for a submit button, I think you just need to; preventDefault, sleep for [timeout], then invoke the button submit, etc.
[15:36:05] <monk3y> Once you're "prevented default", you need to be able to trigger the final event.
[15:36:09] <monk3y> (yourself)
[15:36:31] <__machine> its general purpose... i know there are existing debounce plugins out there but they are more like a replacement for on() which debounces the callback function... im trying to write an actual event handler (to be passed to on()) which can debounce a wrapped callback function OR just prevent the default browser action (no callback)
[15:37:32] <monk3y> Ah.  Yes.  Debouncing.  I know what that means..
[15:37:39] * monk3y surruptitiously alt-tabs
[15:42:24] * monk3y alt-tabs back
[15:42:27] <monk3y> Right.  Deboucning.

[17:16:47] <dankest> Is there an alernative command to  $().html("string")?  IE8 dies whehn "string" is too long.
[17:17:37] <vladikoff> dankest, http://api.jquery.com/text/ ?

[17:18:25] <dankest> vladikoff: thanks
[17:18:27] * monk3y llol's @ rycar (lurking-laugh-out-loud)
[17:20:18] <dankest> vladikoff: I need something that doesn't escape the HTML
[17:21:12] <FrozenFire> dankest, Are you receiving HTML that needs to be converted into a DOM tree?
[17:21:55] <dankest> Yeah, I'm rendering a partial
[17:22:01] <FrozenFire> Not sure if jQuery has its own shortcut, but typically you'd do something like this:
[17:22:16] <dankest> I was using: document.getElementById('id').innerHTML = "string"
[17:22:17] <FrozenFire> var parser = new DOMParser();
[17:22:21] <dankest> But I kinda want a jQuery approach
[17:22:29] <dankest> Where "string" contains HTML
[17:22:43] <dankest> But IE8 shits itself when my html() arg is too long
[17:22:46] <FrozenFire> var result = parser.parseFromString(yourstring, "text/html");
[17:23:05] <FrozenFire> Yeah, that's why I'm suggesting just using Javascript's built-in DOMParser
[17:23:33] <FrozenFire> If anything can do it, that can.
[17:23:43] <FrozenFire> And it's not exactly extraordinarily complicated. :P
[17:23:48] <dankest> Word, thanks
[17:24:57] <Safzouf> Hi Guys
[17:25:03] <Safzouf> I have an advanced question :)
[17:25:16] <Safzouf> I want to trigger manually the Drop event
[17:25:32] <MistuhKurtz> $(el).trigger('drop');
[17:25:33] <Safzouf> and passing $(target)  as parameter
[17:25:33] <MistuhKurtz> :D
[17:25:37] <Safzouf> who can help me?
[17:25:46] <Safzouf> :)
[17:25:49] <Safzouf> this is the first part
[17:26:00] <Safzouf> I need to pass paramter to Drop
[17:26:03] <Safzouf> after triggered
[17:26:09] <MistuhKurtz> Safzouf, take it as far as you can on jsfiddle.net and i'll finish it
[17:26:30] <Safzouf> I'll see
[17:26:59] <Safzouf> is this can be correct:
[17:27:00] <Safzouf> $('#droppable').trigger('drop', $('#draggable'));
[17:27:08] <Safzouf> ?
[17:29:42] <Safzouf> so ?
[17:49:30] <Safzouf> this is the code
[17:49:38] <Safzouf> basic one
[17:49:39] <Safzouf> <MistuhKurtz>
[17:49:44] <Safzouf> http://jsfiddle.net/QS4LZ/
[17:50:07] <Safzouf> I want t otrigger the Drop event, with parameters
[17:50:16] <Safzouf> drop: function( event, ui )
[17:50:23] <Safzouf> it acceps 2 parameters
[17:50:33] <Safzouf> so how to pass them in the trigger?
[17:50:38] <Safzouf> Any help?
[17:56:11] <jrockjiggz> slim chance anyone knows Jcrop?
[18:05:54] <AfroTurf> http://jsfiddle.net/GySNj/ how do i do variable functions in js?
[18:22:09] <cattleFraud> how do you detect the browser back button using jquery?
[18:23:07] <AfroTurf> unload event
[18:23:32] <cattleFraud> I'm doing $(document).unload(function(event){ // blah });
[18:24:07] <cattleFraud> nothing is happening though :|
[18:29:08] <Agamemnus> hi, anyone here use fancybox2?
[18:29:17] <Agamemnus> i have some strange things happening
[18:30:00] <nerdsex> http://jsfiddle.net/6Tm5P/5/ I am trying to detect when the mouse enters the 'box' div. how can i?
[18:30:15] <nerdsex> is(":focus") returns false and length returns 0
[18:30:17] <Agamemnus> like, afterClose fires after an image was loaded in a fancybox
[18:31:09] <oxfouzer> nerdsex: $('boxdivselector').mouseover(function(){ /* */ }); maybe?
[18:31:18] <nerdsex> No
[18:31:54] <Agamemnus> and... .close() doesn't work most of the time
[18:32:16] <Agamemnus> really strange crap.
[18:32:54] <oxfouzer> nerdsex: you using firebug?
[18:33:02] <nerdsex> oxfouzer: yes
[18:33:03] <oxfouzer> I think there might be a clear div above it or something
[18:33:04] <oxfouzer> ?
[18:33:19] <oxfouzer> wait i didnt look at the fiddle lol
[18:33:24] <nerdsex> hah
[18:33:28] <nerdsex> very basic stuff
[18:33:39] <nerdsex> but it seems complicated
[18:33:45] <oxfouzer> umm it works...
[18:33:51] <nerdsex> no
[18:33:54] <nerdsex> it should be true or 1
[18:34:12] <nerdsex> basically on the hover-out function i want to detect if the cursor is on top of .box
[18:35:12] <oxfouzer> um the event fires
[18:35:20] <nerdsex> yes
[18:35:27] <oxfouzer> no console log
[18:35:35] <nerdsex> but i dont want to collapse the .box dive if the mouse hovers to it
[18:35:39] <nerdsex> div*
[18:35:50] <oxfouzer> oh i get it...
[18:35:58] <oxfouzer> why are you not using something thats already built?
[18:36:03] <nerdsex> like what?
[18:36:05] <oxfouzer> there are plenty of great dropdown menu systems
[18:36:11] <nerdsex> oh
[18:36:13] <nerdsex> no
[18:36:15] <AfroTurf> why not but .box inside your link
[18:36:20] <nerdsex> can't
[18:36:23] <Agamemnus> i guess it's just the crappy documentation
[18:36:43] <nerdsex> i want to figure this out, it got personal
[18:37:33] <oxfouzer> nerdsex: your personal vendetta against this isn't worth it :P
[18:37:42] <nerdsex> ='(
[18:38:10] <AfroTurf> why can't you put .box inside .link to save urself a lot of trouble
[18:38:24] <nerdsex> because in the real thing .box is absolute positioned
[18:38:24] <_databack> .join #asp.net
[18:38:29] <_databack> ooppps
[18:38:37] <AfroTurf> so
[19:27:46] <Boze> when i do this localStorage loop http://pastebin.com/nCpMgAcN I try to put its contents in a div, but I think it just keeps overwriting each value with .html() and just shows the last one. is there a way to += so I see all the values?
[19:30:23] <rycar> Boze: instead of .html() try .append()
[19:30:50] <Boze> rycar, okay
[19:56:32] <GoSox> So i have this $.post() that I run. It's part of a function that runs every second (yes that's a lot). And what seems to be happening is about 5% of the time, $.post()'s callback function is being 'run' twice (run, called, whatever the proper term is)
[19:59:30] <GoSox> here's a copy of my code: http://pastebin.com/q55sQ7sj
[20:01:25] <rycar> instead of calling it once a second perhaps use a setTimeout in the complete callback
[20:01:56] <rycar> browser will only let you make so many connections at a time, might have trouble if the connections are slow
[20:02:28] <GoSox> but how would that cause post's callback to run twice with the same data?
[20:02:32] <rycar> or, run it once a second like you are doing, but only initiate another request if the first one finished
[20:02:59] <GoSox> this isn't a timeout issue, i'm getting results, twice
[20:03:05] <GoSox> its not like i'm getting a blank or an error
[20:03:15] <rycar> I know, it's unrelated to your question
[20:03:23] <GoSox> the post is getting data, and that same data is getting processes twice
[20:08:25] <rycar> what is likely happening is that one request hasn't finished yet, so it hasn't changed the $start_value before the event fires again
[20:11:29] <GoSox> hmm
[20:12:52] <GoSox> that makes a lot of sense
[20:13:21] <GoSox> so tell me more about using settimeout to run code repeatedly instead of setinterval
[20:13:57] <RobW> function runMe() { /* do something */ setTimeout(runMe, 1000); } runMe();
[20:14:13] <RobW> I prefer setInterval because you can control it out of scope
[20:14:43] <RobW> Unless, of course, you have some sort of break in the runMe() func
[20:15:11] <rycar> I was saying you could use the setTimeout in the ajax callback, so that after you have finished receiving data is when the delay starts
[20:15:43] <aqeel> hi everybody
[20:16:20] <aqeel> http://jailbreak.webege.com/js/plugins/aautoscroll.js
[20:18:13] <aqeel> edge scroll works perfectly, but i have this one issue, if it finishes scrolling and reaches edge top or bottom and calling edgescroll works, but after that to make it work again, one must click any other button
[20:19:18] <aqeel> if it is clicked while scrolling it is owrking but if it hits edge and cliking edgescroll will not work but only first time
[20:19:40] <aqeel> what might be the cause, and why it only works first time?
[20:20:31] <aqeel> sample here... jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[20:24:22] <GoSox> RobW:
[20:24:36] <GoSox> so the function calls itself with a settimeout function?
[20:25:21] <GoSox> that seems like it wouldn't not perform very well, running about every second, for lets say, a few hours
[20:25:22] <RobW> GoSox: yes.. what i provided is an infinite loop
[20:25:30] <RobW> it would be fine..
[20:26:55] <GoSox> ok i shall try it
[20:27:36] <kristofers> I have an iphone and there's 2 button on the side, where if you hover it will slide up or down on the iphone's iframe, but since the iframe is poiting to an external url, is there any alternative to keep this working ?
[20:27:59] <kristofers> Since you can't use javascript on another site
[20:28:31] <GoSox> how do you hover on an iphone, it has no cursor
[20:28:40] <kristofers> it's an image
[20:28:55] <kristofers> An image of an iphone and there's an iframe as the screen
[20:29:20] <kristofers> I then have two buttons one up and one down, and if you hover it will slide up or down on the screen
[20:29:29] <kristofers> This works fine if the iframe's url is the same as the website
[20:29:36] <kristofers> But not if it's pointing to another site
[20:30:36] <innociv_> http://jsfiddle.net/ATstG/ Hard to explain what I'm trying to do here,but the tiny bit of code and the console log should illustrate it I think? I want that console log to say 0%, or 0.2% if rank were 1. Instead it's NaN
[20:30:58] <kristofers> I'm a bit tired, i don't know why i said i have an iphone haha, since it doesn't have anything to do with my problem
[20:33:20] <GoSox> RobW
[20:33:29] <kristofers> How about an iframe within an iframe :O
[20:33:43] <GoSox> so my setTimeout has to be inside the callback of the POST for it to actually wait a second after my data is returned, right?
[20:33:57] <GoSox> and having the setTimeout not be the very last thing in the function, isn't going to be a problem?
[20:35:33] <innociv_> I think I got it
[20:35:37] <innociv_> need to make it a function
[20:35:39] <innociv_> like a class
[20:39:09] <RobW> GoSox: it should be the last thing.. but it doesn't matter
[20:39:13] <RobW> too much*
[20:39:45] <digitalmediaguy> Evening
[20:39:54] <GoSox> it is the last thing in post's callback function, so it's not quite the last thing in the actual wrapper function
[20:40:32] <GoSox> RobW: like this http://pastebin.com/VsrhUVi8
[20:42:57] <digitalmediaguy> I am curious if someone can help me solve a quick problem where an animation breaks with multiple instances of it on the page…Single Working Animation = http://jsfiddle.net/djb3T/1/    THEN Broken http://jsfiddle.net/uT4LQ/ with multiple on the page :-/
[20:49:30] <RobW> digitalmediaguy: the 2nd links works fine
[20:49:49] <digitalmediaguy> sorry… I didn't save the fiddle… ad /1
[20:52:11] <digitalmediaguy> argh… that fiddle is all messed up… sorry… I'll make a new one… I had one all setup where I changed the id's to classes but it still wasn't working
[20:54:25] <digitalmediaguy> http://jsfiddle.net/uT4LQ/2/
[20:54:53] <digitalmediaguy> the animation still works… it just acts funky
[20:55:37] <RobW> digitalmediaguy: because it's calculating the sum of all
[20:55:51] <RobW> replace THIS: $(".ToBeAnimated").animate({
[20:55:59] <RobW> with THIS: $(".ToBeAnimated").each($(this).animate({
[20:57:28] <RobW> you actually need to put each entity in its own stack
[20:58:52] <digitalmediaguy> hmmmm…. ok… THANKS!… gonna see if I can't get it working :)
[21:00:28] <digitalmediaguy> http://jsfiddle.net/uT4LQ/3/
[21:00:43] <digitalmediaguy> like so?… something still slightly off :-/
[21:02:11] <RobW> digitalmediaguy: http://jsfiddle.net/uT4LQ/4/
[21:03:06] <RobW> but you may need to work on animations
[21:04:31] <RobW> digitalmediaguy: you may want to do something a bit different, like call one function, then run a switch()
[21:04:46] <RobW> based on the case, 1-4, you throw the scissors in the appropriate direction
[21:05:32] <digitalmediaguy> That is sweet!… Thank you… I am going to play for sure! I actually am trying to have a button in each square that when clicked starts the animation ONLY for that div
[21:05:35] <b1lly> can you
[21:05:58] <RobW> digitalmediaguy: that much recursion for animation is causing this weird lag I think
[21:06:13] <digitalmediaguy> http://extremecouponnetwork.com/
[21:06:18] <digitalmediaguy> yeah I saw that :-/
[21:06:30] <digitalmediaguy> I am just trying to cut out my coupons! ;)
[21:06:44] <digitalmediaguy> see the clip it button at the bottom of each one?
[21:07:09] <b1lly> lets say you have dom elements (<div id="foo"></div>").            and an object like var bar = { x : 1, y: 2 }       and then created an jquery object var $foo = $('#foo')              is there anyway to associate var bar with $foo
[21:07:17] <digitalmediaguy> anyway… Can you think of a better way to do the animation perhaps?
[21:07:18] <b1lly> like link them together
[21:07:40] <b1lly> so I could do like
[21:07:42] <innociv> You need to factor in my screen resolution for the first amount you load.  Just did one row when my screen could fit 4.
[21:07:44] <b1lly> $foo.x
[21:07:52] <b1lly> or $foo.bar.x
[21:08:13] <innociv> I'm not seeing any animation on "clip it" clicking
[21:08:38] <digitalmediaguy> hmmm… what browser?
[21:08:45] <innociv> firefox
[21:08:58] <innociv> Does the same in chrome
[21:09:03] <innociv> i have to start scrolling before it fills the screen
[21:09:08] <innociv> Starts mostly blank just one row
[21:09:22] <innociv> Wait now it just spazzed out and filled htem all
[21:10:13] <digitalmediaguy> yeah… that's something else!… but each coupon has a clip it link that should start an animation… however currently it starts an animation on only the 1st coupon
[21:13:05] <b1lly> can you extend a jquery object (dom element)
[21:20:08] <digitalmediaguy> Hey RobW…. so I tried your code on the site and it's acting a bit unexpected now… When I click the "CLIP IT" link the scissors all appear but there is no animation?!
[21:20:54] <digitalmediaguy> nm
[21:25:00] <GoSox> I have a $.post in a loop that runs over and over. I let it run for a while on a bunch of browser, and it looks like if the $.post fails, the whole script stops. How can i ignore failures and let the script just keep going?
[21:32:27] <GoSox> ohhhh i seeeeeee whats going on
[21:39:12] <JoeSlack> GoSox: Add an error handler
[21:39:16] <GoSox> yeah
[21:39:27] <JoeSlack> it should continue loop on success, OR fail
[21:39:28] <GoSox> so i just read the ajaxError() page
[21:39:37] <GoSox> but i don't get exactly how to use that function
[21:39:43] <JoeSlack> same as the success one
[21:40:10] <GoSox> my success function is a call back in the $.post command
[21:40:13] <JoeSlack> use, .complete and .error
[21:40:45] <GoSox> can you point me to any example code because i don' tknow what you mean
[21:40:48] <JoeSlack> $.post('hotmail.com', { serializedDataHere}, function(success) { ... }).complete({ alert('hi mom');}).error({ alert("i suck"); });
[21:41:13] <GoSox> hmm
[21:41:28] <GoSox> so in that code
[21:41:36] <GoSox> success and complete seem like the same thing?
[21:41:50] <JoeSlack> i shouldn't have called it success. ,i  usually use "event" or something
[21:41:57] <JoeSlack> generally, if that function runs - yes, complete will do
[21:42:00] <JoeSlack> to*
[21:42:09] <JoeSlack> but you generally handle your data there like
[21:42:15] <JoeSlack> function(data){ }
[21:42:23] <JoeSlack> alert(data.somedata);
[21:42:36] <JoeSlack> complete runs AFTER all that.
[21:42:52] <JoeSlack> actually - i think complete runs no matter what
[21:42:53] <JoeSlack> you can use
[21:42:57] <JoeSlack> .success
[21:43:09] <JoeSlack> .error()  .success()  .complete() are what you can use.
[21:43:18] <JoeSlack> try it... you'll figure out out quickly
[21:43:33] <GoSox> i'm trying to use .error()
[21:43:42] <GoSox> i just threw an alert in there to test
[21:43:46] <JoeSlack> yep
[21:43:52] <GoSox> i'm not getting an alert and i'm not getting errors in the console
[21:43:58] <JoeSlack> use jsfiddle
[21:44:02] <GoSox> but i know there is an error because i renamed the .php file it's loading
[21:44:09] <JoeSlack> post ur code
[21:44:59] <GoSox> http://jsfiddle.net/TfWR8/
[21:45:22] <JoeSlack> where is data.php?
[21:45:25] <JoeSlack> absolute url
[21:45:42] <GoSox> http://www.menulizard.com/live/data.php
[21:46:02] <GoSox> but i thought you can't do ajax from different domains
[21:46:07] <GoSox> jsfiddle.net -> menulizard.com
[21:46:45] <JoeSlack> cross domain filtering :(
[21:47:04] <JoeSlack> are u sure webserver giving good response?
[21:47:22] <GoSox> well no, it works when it works, the issue is that it doesn't fail when i rename data.php
[21:47:37] <JoeSlack> can u add:   $_POST = $_GET on the top of the PHP?  we can pass get parameters then
[21:47:46] <JoeSlack> caching!!
[21:47:52] <JoeSlack> ?
[21:48:37] <GoSox> data.php is working perfectly. what i'm trying to catch with this is HTTP errors, which i'm simulating by renaming data.php once this script has started running
[21:48:39] <JoeSlack> is this mobile, or desktop
[21:48:46] <GoSox> i expected to get my alert, but i get nothing
[21:48:53] <GoSox> desktop
[21:49:28] <JoeSlack> I don't think error works like that
[21:49:53] <GoSox> didn't you just tell me to do it this way?
[21:50:31] <JoeSlack> Ya, but i misunderstood your problem, I didn't realize you were testing for broken domain paths.
[21:51:05] <JoeSlack> but i'm not sure, im testing now
[21:51:31] <GoSox> the ultimate problem i'm having is that my setTimeout (the thing that continues the loop) is inside post's success callback. So when HTTP fails, the loop is broken. So I need an error call back that also has the setTimeout
[21:51:53] <GoSox> so that success or fail, the loop keeps on looping
[21:52:18] <innociv> How can I cleanly do a toFixed() that doesn't add zeros?
[21:52:53] <innociv> nvm
[21:53:45] <JoeSlack> GoSox: So it works for me giving an error on Cross Domain anyway: http://jsfiddle.net/TfWR8/1/
[21:54:34] <GoSox> did you change anything? alther than adding the started alert?
[21:55:05] <JoeSlack> added jquery, added variable value hardcoded
[21:55:12] <JoeSlack> just run it, does it give you error?
[21:55:17] <GoSox> no
[21:55:23] <JoeSlack> what browser?
[21:55:26] <GoSox> chrome
[21:55:30] <JoeSlack> works on chrome/windows
[21:55:34] <JoeSlack> and chrome/mac
[21:55:44] <GoSox> it loads data.php every 1.5 seconds, everything is good
[21:55:51] <JoeSlack> you don't get the "error" popup?  weird.  works everytime here
[21:56:01] <GoSox> then i remove data.php from the server and chrome just stops, on console errors, no alert from my error handler
[21:56:08] <GoSox> yeah i enver get the error popup
[21:56:11] <GoSox> i don't get it
[21:57:03] <GoSox> :)
[21:57:06] <JoeSlack> weird, i get it every time
[21:57:15] <JoeSlack> works like a charm
[21:57:27] <GoSox> it's following my 404 redirect to the home page
[21:57:33] <GoSox> so jquery isn't ever seeing a failure
[21:58:24] <GoSox> so assuming it actually is working properly
[21:58:33] <JoeSlack> You can so easily add a mobile layout with your setup
[21:58:42] <JoeSlack> so the left column gets put up top
[21:58:54] <innociv> wait no
[21:58:57] <GoSox> i have an old mobile app from the old site design that i am going to rebuild
[21:59:00] <GoSox> touch.menulizard.com
[21:59:27] <JoeSlack> coolio
[21:59:39] <GoSox> JoeSlack: so does .complete() run after the post is done, or after the post is done AND after the .success() is done?
[21:59:53] <JoeSlack> after both AFAIK
[22:00:01] <JoeSlack> easy to find out.
[22:00:09] <GoSox> is there a doc page on these functions? i've searched but nothing specific comes up
[22:00:22] <JoeSlack> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/ is best
[22:00:34] <GoSox> yeah that page doesn't get specific about those functions
[22:01:01] <GoSox> so i'm going to test this by running the script on my laptop, then turning wifi off
[22:01:02] <GoSox> then back on
[22:03:13] <systemfault> It's easy… there's .done .fail .always and in some cases .progress
[22:03:28] <systemfault> All the others are aliases and should not be used
[22:04:33] <JoeSlack> there you have it
[22:04:50] <JoeSlack> u should write the docs ;)
[22:05:02] <JoeSlack> thats way more informative
[22:05:39] <systemfault> JoeSlack: It's written but only on the jQuery.ajax page
[22:06:05] <JoeSlack> true
[22:07:50] <GoSox> systemfault: so does .always() run after the http request, or after the http request AND after the .done() function?
[22:10:38] <GoSox> and also, success, error and complete, are such better names than done, fail and always
[22:12:50] <systemfault> GoSox: I'm not totally sure about the order :/
[22:13:45] <systemfault> As for the names, while success/error/always might seem better, $.ajax actually uses the jQuery Deferred object which is made to be more generic.
[22:15:07] <GoSox> fair enough

[22:17:55] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/hxVWG/
[22:18:36] <aqeel> code works as expected, but i would like to make it run when at edges and not only when encountring the edges
[22:19:08] <aqeel> this works fine when edges are encountered..
[22:19:26] <aqeel> but if already at edges it will not work..
[22:23:42] <aqeel> please help me out with the issue

[23:32:57] <jrockjiggz> Hi, i'm tryin to get .width() of an element in a callback, but in IE its giving me '28*30' instead of '260*253'.. if I type .width() into IE console i then do get 260x253 as expected, so this proves i must need to add a delay.. but i really dont want to it seems the wrong thing to do...  i've always tried outerWidth() but get same issue
[23:36:26] <_sCoRpi> jrockjiggz: can you reproduce that problem in a fiddle?
[23:37:42] <Whiskey> _sCoRpi: :D
[23:38:26] <_sCoRpi> morning Whiskey
[23:38:36] <jrockjiggz> _sCoRpi: its pretty integrated across many files.. not so easily :/
[23:38:36] <Whiskey> morrning :D
[23:38:43] <Whiskey> I just have one problem left :)
[23:38:49] <_sCoRpi> and that would be?
[23:39:45] <jrockjiggz> Morning btw
[23:40:10] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/19/ <-- you see it
[23:41:02] <Whiskey> Now it just need to know if the width of the border is bigger then the rows itself are
[23:49:28] <_sCoRpi> Wiskey: come again? If the width of the border is bigger then the row itself?
[23:50:52] <Whiskey> yeh
[23:51:02] <Whiskey> in the exmple you see know
[23:51:12] <Whiskey> the rows are 50%50% right
[23:51:34] <Whiskey> and them are symetric, if you get one that is bbiger it will expand everyone else two
[23:52:16] <Whiskey> but as you see the longest text, <span class="infoViewLineRight">But where is the errorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr</span> are not so width so it will fill out the rows in the border
[23:52:34] <Whiskey> you see it left some space on right side
[23:53:03] <_sCoRpi> Whiskey: i cannot follow you
[23:54:25] <Whiskey> lets see if i can do a dirty trick to show you
[23:55:54] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/19/ <-- shuld look more like this -> http://jsfiddle.net/C253Z/25/
[23:57:17] <jrockjiggz> ^^ turns out wrapping everything in setTimeout( function(){ }, 0); forced it to work
[23:57:43] <_sCoRpi> Whiskey: what about removing the margins on the rows elements and giving them width: 49%; ?
[23:57:48] <_sCoRpi> does  that solve your issue?
[23:57:57] <_sCoRpi> apply that width to .infoViewLine
[23:57:59] <Whiskey> can see
[23:59:53] <Whiskey> no you need to do it whit jquery
