[00:00:09] <HowardwLo> Cork: so how i have it setup on my site, is that i divide my pages into three columns
[00:00:20] <HowardwLo> and after ajax, i just swap out each of the three columns
[00:00:30] <HowardwLo> i have no idea if thats how it should be done, but it was easy at the time
[00:00:47] <Cork> HowardwLo: it is one valid to solve it
[00:01:01] <HowardwLo> Cork: so its not taboo or anything? cool
[00:01:30] <HowardwLo> Cork: i was using replaceAll for each leftsection, centersection, rightsection, but I also had my event listeners on it
[00:01:45] <HowardwLo> Cork: guess now i’ll throw a holder around each section and tag my event listener to that
[00:02:04] <Cork> HowardwLo: a better option might be to use .html() with the content of the sections
[00:02:09] <Cork> instead of replacing the sections
[00:02:27] <HowardwLo> the size of the sections differ by page
[00:02:36] <HowardwLo> Cork: some pages dont use some of the sections either
[00:02:40] <Cork> not sure how that matters
[00:02:44] <Cork> ah
[00:02:59] <Cork> how so have a shared parent and do it there
[00:03:14] <Cork> <main></main> $('main').html(newContent);
[00:03:47] <HowardwLo> Cork: hm i guess that works too. does that defeat the purpose of event listeners though?
[00:03:58] <Cork> HowardwLo: not really
[00:03:59] <HowardwLo> if my <main> is pretty much my <body>
[00:04:13] <Cork> well then bind it on document
[00:04:41] <HowardwLo> i dont think i ever learned this properly, but what is the point of using event listeners?
[00:18:28] <litropy> HowardwLo, responding to/handling events.
[00:18:39] <litropy> http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[00:21:42] <litropy> On my obile device, when I switch from horizontal to vertical, everything looks wonky for a bit, before my responsive code kicks in. Is there a way I can set, for instance, $('main').css('visibility','hidden') before everything looks wonky?
[00:21:48] <litropy> mobile*
[00:22:11] <Cork> litropy: @media
[00:22:19] <Cork> js will always be reactive
[00:22:24] <Cork> so it will always be late
[00:23:21] <litropy> Thx, Cork
[00:29:56] <HowardwLo> does popState also ruin event listeners?
[00:30:17] <Cork> HowardwLo: that question doesn't make sense
[00:30:38] <Cork> why an when would it run what event listener?
[00:31:38] <HowardwLo> Cork: i added eventlistener popstate to my window
[00:32:01] <Cork> event listeners is how you listen for events
[00:32:05] <HowardwLo> that event listener calls a function to replace parts of my dom to make it look like a browser back
[00:32:15] <Cork> so yes popstate events fire popstate event listeners
[00:33:02] <HowardwLo> right, pop state event fires popstate event listeners
[00:33:10] <Cork> no
[00:33:21] <Cork> popstate events not pop state events
[00:33:37] <HowardwLo> sorry, popstate
[00:33:39] <Guest22601> hy, anyone have problem with this site jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[00:33:39] <Guest22601> ?
[00:34:08] <HowardwLo> so my event listeners replaces my page with content stored with pushState previously
[00:34:09] <Cork> Guest22601: define "problem with"
[00:34:21] <Guest22601> Cork, it is offline for me..
[00:34:31] <HowardwLo> when that content is replaced, so I lose my event listeners for whatever is replaced?
[00:34:36] <HowardwLo> do*
[00:34:40] <Cork> ?down http://jqueryui.com
[00:34:40] <b-ot> Cork: It's just you. http://jqueryui.com is up! (200 OK)
[00:35:01] <Cork> HowardwLo: ya?
[00:35:36] <Guest22601> http://jqueryui.com also down for me
[00:35:48] <Cork> Guest22601: just you
[00:35:53] <Cork> check your dns resolver
[00:35:57] <Guest22601> hm
[00:39:23] <Guest22601> still down doesn't know where is problem, anyway can someone help me with my code http://pastebin.com/DR6KHGUi, i cannot get to my datepicker2 selected value from datepicker1, will try to put everything to jsfidle or just give site online soo everyone can see what is problem
[00:41:43] <litropy> Guest22601, it took a long time to respond for me, but it's up.
[00:42:11] <Cork> hmm so you can reproduce
[00:42:26] <HowardwLo> Cork: ok, i think i’ve got it. thanks!
[00:52:15] <Guest22601> http://www.predloga.com/reservation-form/ here is my web, when i select date in Check in i would like that it also select it in Check out so someone will know from where to where or at least that it disables all date before selected one from Check in
[00:57:43] <underhillj> Good morning guys, I was wondering if someone could cast their eye over a simple jquery change event handler that doesnt seem to be working ?
[01:01:09] <ocmnt> underhillj, link?
[01:01:19] <underhillj> ocmnt, thanks http://pastebin.com/SJeMXQ2r
[01:01:48] <underhillj> ocmnt, ive tried putting alerts in but they dont seem to fire
[01:02:52] <underhillj> ocmnt, just incase you want to see the elements it refers to.. http://pastebin.com/GbyeMVpF
[01:03:00] <ocmnt> what kind of input you use? textfield/passwordfield?
[01:03:08] <underhillj> its a password field
[01:03:15] <ocmnt> try using keyup
[01:03:25] <underhillj> ok, let me try
[01:03:53] <ocmnt> field.on('keyup', function() {
[01:03:56] <ocmnt> should do
[01:04:16] <ocmnt> on which field is your $("#NewPassword")
[01:05:16] <underhillj> ocmnt, that works! Why do you think the change event wasnt working? Limitation of password field ?
[01:05:25] <Cork> underhillj: what does $('[id="NewPassword"]').length give you?
[01:05:35] <Cork> ah
[01:05:44] <Cork> underhillj: change fires on blur for input fields
[01:05:57] <ocmnt> I think change only works on radio/checkbox inputs
[01:06:03] <Cork> no
[01:06:11] <underhillj> Cork, ah ok that makes sense!
[01:06:25] <ocmnt> ah, what cork said :P
[01:06:31] <underhillj> Thanks both for your help! Its really appreciated.. Ive been staring at it for ages
[01:06:39] <Cork> ocmnt, underhillj: alsu use input not keydown/keyup
[01:06:45] <Cork> *also
[01:07:02] <underhillj> Cork: ill change that now
[01:07:24] <Cork> ?g mdn input event
[01:07:24] <b-ot> Cork: input - Event reference | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/input
[01:07:27] <ocmnt> Cork why use input and not keyup?
[01:08:03] <Cork> ocmnt: keyup doesn't catch key repetition (holding down the key)
[01:08:18] <Cork> and keydown fires before the value is added to the field
[01:08:46] <underhillj> Cork: Ah that makes sense I suppose, I wont forget that in a hurry!
[01:08:55] <ocmnt> keyup would catch the last 'typed' character right?
[01:09:01] <Cork> yes
[01:09:03] <ocmnt> for fieldvalidation that is the moment it should trigger, not earlier I think
[01:09:08] <ocmnt> though I get your point ;)
[01:09:29] <Cork> ocmnt: depends on how responsive you want it to be
[01:09:41] <Cork> ex if you want to limit the number of entered characters
[01:09:47] <Cork> holding down the key would break that
[01:09:53] <ocmnt> fair enough
[01:10:19] <Cork> basically only situation i can see you wouldn't want that would be remote validation
[01:10:31] <Cork> but then you want rate limiting not "only released keys"
[01:10:43] <ocmnt> remote validation for passwords is not really secure imho
[01:10:46] <Cork> (only fire after 2 sec of inactivity)
[01:11:08] <Cork> ocmnt: it isn't less secure then anything else
[01:11:39] <Cork> ocmnt: and you should never relying on client side validation
[01:11:42] <ocmnt> I disagree on that, since the password get send to some place
[01:11:51] <shebbi> Hi, when I return data from an ajax success function i get undefined, but I can alert the data. For example: $data = my_function(); my_function(){ $.post(....function(data){return data; });
[01:12:02] <Cork> ocmnt: and if you don't send the password how it is meant to be used on the server?
[01:12:08] <Cork> ocmnt: mind control?
[01:12:15] <ocmnt> hm, was thinking of that
[01:12:21] <ocmnt> got any solution for that perhaps? :D
[01:12:28] <Cork> ocmnt: the connection should be over https
[01:12:34] <Cork> so sending the password should be ok
[01:12:43] <ocmnt> or just use bash
[01:12:45] <ocmnt> :D
[01:13:06] <Cork> not sure how that relates to this problem
[01:13:37] <Cork> the bash bug was about bash executing code in environment variables
[01:13:59] <ocmnt> I know, I am just trolling now
[01:14:08] <ocmnt> since I lost the argument and am in desperate need of more coffee
[01:14:11] <ocmnt> sorry :(
[01:14:14] <Cork> lol
[01:14:27] <ocmnt> in other words, thanks for the information given :D
[01:14:32] <shebbi> is a function that returns data need to specify it returns something in the function definition?
[01:14:53] <shebbi> as when i do this it fails:
[01:14:53] <Cork> shebbi: ajax is async, you can't return anything from then
[01:14:54] <shebbi> is a function that returns data need to specify it returns something in the function definition?
[01:15:07] <shebbi> darn
[01:15:17] <Cork> shebbi: the best you can do is use deferred
[01:15:26] <shebbi> that's really bad
[01:15:33] <Cork> function fetch() { return $.ajax(); }
[01:15:46] <Cork> fetch().done(function(data) { /*data */ })
[01:16:43] <Cork> shebbi: but as async means the current stack has to exit completely before the async callback can fire
[01:17:00] <Cork> it means return will have to run BEFORE the callback fires
[01:17:22] <shebbi> right
[01:17:28] <Cork> so that means it is technically impossibly to return from async
[01:17:33] <shebbi> fetch is a keyword here?
[01:17:39] <shebbi> or i make makeup any name?
[01:17:45] <Cork> well unless you want to return to the function who called you async
[01:17:48] <Cork> function fetch() { return $.ajax(); } <--
[01:17:58] <Cork> posted it on the line above the example
[01:20:39] <shebbi> so: function fetch() { $.post(){...}; return $.post(); }; correct?
[01:20:45] <shebbi> i'm using $.post
[01:20:53] <Cork> no
[01:21:15] <shebbi> oh
[01:21:18] <Cork> $.post(){...}; isn't even valid code
[01:21:33] <shebbi> you mean whack a return in front of it?
[01:21:36] <Cork> function fetch() { return $.post('url'); };
[01:21:49] <Cork> and it doesn't have to be called fetch
[01:22:14] <shebbi> cheers. lets see what happens now.
[01:24:08] <shebbi> i guess one removes the standard function(data){} code in $.post and just handle that on fetch().done(function(data)
[01:24:21] <Cork> shebbi: yes
[01:24:31] <Cork> shebbi: you could also use $.Callbacks()
[01:24:38] <Cork> and create your own custom callback
[01:24:49] <Cork> that you cold fire from the success callback
[01:24:55] <Cork> if you want to preprocess the data
[01:25:05] <shebbi> oh ok
[01:25:48] <shebbi> by call backs im guessing you mean keep the function(data){ function my_callback(); }
[01:26:00] <Cork> function fetch() { var handle = $.Callback(); $.post(url, function(data) { /* process */handle.fire(processed_data); }); return handle; }
[01:26:10] <Cork> fetch().add(function(data) {});
[01:26:41] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com jquery.Callback
[01:26:42] <b-ot> Cork: Callbacks Object | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/category/callbacks-object/
[01:27:07] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/3
[01:27:09] <Cork> bah
[01:27:10] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[01:28:29] <shebbi> so with calls backs you can use return
[01:28:35] <Cork> no
[01:28:39] <shebbi> that way seems nicer
[01:28:48] <Cork> you can return a way to access the data
[01:28:55] <Cork> you can't still not really return a value
[01:29:15] <Cork> *you still can't really
[01:29:43] <shebbi> so what does handle contain then?
[01:29:53] <Cork> it contains a Callback object
[01:29:57] <hd1> http://hasan.d8u.us/shared_links.html isn't showing anything
[01:30:05] <Cork> with a function to add callbacks
[01:30:13] <hd1> i suspect i've messed up the javascript
[01:30:15] <Cork> and a way to fire all those callbacks with the data you have
[01:31:12] <shebbi> so i still have to do: handle().done(function(data){});
[01:31:27] <Cork> well except it is called .add not .done
[01:31:35] <Cork> (you can rename it)
[01:31:45] <shebbi> so i still have to do: handle().add(function(data){});
[01:31:54] <Cork> yes
[01:32:16] <shebbi> oh you mean rename the 'handle' to anything i like?
[01:32:21] <Cork> no
[01:32:25] <Cork> one min
[01:35:05] <hd1> http://hasan.d8u.us/shared_links.html isn't showing anything
[01:35:22] <Cork> hd1: you need to ask a question
[01:35:28] <Cork> if you want help
[01:36:14] <Cork> lovely
[01:36:22] <hd1> Cork: "why is it not loading?"
[01:36:23] <Cork> jsfiddle has gone belly up...
[01:36:37] <shebbi> damn u jsfiddle
[01:36:49] <hd1> seems to be fine here, Cork
[01:37:16] <Cork> shebbi: http://jsbin.com/guxibilavowa/1/edit
[01:37:29] <Cork> hd1: i get js error so can't save the page
[01:37:58] <Cork> TypeError: this.contains is not a function    moo-clientcide-1.3.js:850
[01:39:03] <Cork> hd1: about your question, open your browser console
[01:56:13] <HowardwLo> Cork: going back to waht you said earlier, having the event listener on a shared parent
[01:56:26] <HowardwLo> Cork: are there big performance issues
[01:56:55] <Cork> HowardwLo: depends
[01:57:10] <shebbi> Cork: This is what I'm trying to do. Not working yet though. http://jsfiddle.net/7676mLct/1/
[01:57:15] <Cork> HowardwLo: adding many event handlers to the dom makes it slower
[01:57:40] <Cork> HowardwLo: so if you by moving it to the parent have to add more event listeners, then yes that reduces performance
[01:58:17] <Cork> HowardwLo: but on the other hand (more commonly) you can add one event handler on a parent to handle events from many childs (buttons on each row of a table for example)
[01:58:28] <Cork> then you will have IMPROVED performance
[01:59:10] <HowardwLo> Cork: i fear i may have the prior situation
[01:59:29] <Cork> HowardwLo: how many event handlers are we talking about?
[02:00:04] <Cork> damn what's wrong with jsfiddle...
[02:00:15] <HowardwLo> Cork: 4 per page about
[02:00:32] <Cork> HowardwLo: so you mean you would have to add 4 * every page you have?
[02:01:11] <FilipNortic> I'm getting xss varnings from jsfiddle but that my be normal
[02:02:21] <Cork> sigh and jsfiddle is the only one that has an echo api as far as i know :s
[02:02:45] <HowardwLo> Cork: ya
[02:02:58] <Cork> HowardwLo: then ya, that might be a bad idea
[02:03:49] <Cork> at least cause of manageability or scalability
[02:04:06] <Cork> HowardwLo: what you might want to do then is either send the js with the html
[02:04:17] <Cork> HowardwLo: or define functions that add the js needed
[02:04:26] <Cork> and send what function to call after the html has been added
[02:04:57] <HowardwLo> Cork: inline js ?
[02:05:09] <Cork> HowardwLo: ugg no
[02:05:12] <Cork> not in the html
[02:05:31] <HowardwLo> Cork: js after the html
[02:05:35] <Cork> no
[02:05:56] <Cork> either you send json with javascript as text (and eval it)
[02:06:10] <Cork> or you can send js with the html in the js
[02:06:27] <Cork> or you send json with the html and a function name to call
[02:06:48] <Cork> or you could set a data-<something> attribute in the html for what function to call
[02:06:57] <Cork> there is plenty of ways to do it
[02:07:12] <HowardwLo> Cork: none of which i’m familiar with :(
[02:07:16] <Cork> i recommend against eval or inline though
[02:07:51] <Cork> HowardwLo: have the js in a .js resource
[02:07:54] <Cork> and load it on page load
[02:08:03] <Cork> in it you have a functions for the different pages
[02:08:11] <Cork> when the page loads you just run that function
[02:08:35] <Cork> HowardwLo: server side you could split that resource into one file per page or something if you like
[02:08:40] <Cork> and then concat it before you publish
[02:10:45] <HowardwLo> Cork: that sounds a bit like what i’m already doing
[02:10:57] <HowardwLo> i think i didnt explain clearly enough :D
[02:11:19] <HowardwLo> basically, my whole site is ajaxed, login, pages, the whole shebang
[02:11:41] <HowardwLo> we opted for server side rendering, so my ajax responds with full dom’s
[02:11:48] <HowardwLo> and my js replaces elements
[02:11:49] <Magazine> Hey friend can anyone tell me how can i load a file with
[02:12:06] <Magazine> .load () function
[02:12:11] <Cork> uh server side rendering??
[02:12:17] <Cork> i very much doubt that
[02:12:58] <Cork> you might mean server side generated html?
[02:13:03] <HowardwLo> Cork: i think its server side rendering… when someone clicks a link, i preventDefault and ajax the content
[02:13:08] <HowardwLo> ya, server side generated html
[02:13:13] <HowardwLo> so no json being passed
[02:13:31] <Cork> HowardwLo: server side rendering would mean the server renders the html and basically sends a video stream or a png to the client
[02:13:48] <HowardwLo> Cork: oh, then no, not server side rendering
[02:13:48] <Cork> and the client just draws the pixels it gets sent
[02:14:31] <HowardwLo> so in an effort to make it easy, i just decided to replaceAll 3 sections
[02:14:40] <HowardwLo> so if you divide my page into 3 columns, that would be it
[02:14:52] <HowardwLo> previously i had my event listener on a shared parent
[02:15:06] <HowardwLo> but, i was told that was bad because all of my event listeners started with that parent
[02:15:25] <Cork> it really depends on the amount of event listeners
[02:15:36] <Cork> and yes if each page has to have there own event handler
[02:15:41] <Cork> then you can't really scale
[02:15:53] <Cork> if you write the event handlers to be generic it could be another matter though
[02:16:14] <Cork> meaning something like
[02:16:23] <HowardwLo> i have a login event listener, like “show the login modal” on every page
[02:16:27] <HowardwLo> i count that as 1 for each page
[02:16:38] <Cork> instead of adding an event handler for "login_form" you add a "form_submit" event handler
[02:16:55] <HowardwLo> right, i do have that for both registration and login
[02:16:59] <HowardwLo> they share the same event listener
[02:17:01] <Cork> HowardwLo: that i would count as one for all
[02:17:04] <Cork> not one for each
[02:17:07] <HowardwLo> Cork: oh
[02:17:31] <HowardwLo> using that same example, i also counted mousetrap signup’s as another event listener
[02:17:37] <HowardwLo> since its a different button
[02:18:35] <HowardwLo> i guess some of my pages have very little, just a next button event listener (linear browsing experience here), and login/signup
[02:19:02] <Cork> HowardwLo: those should definitely be on a shared parent
[02:19:04] <HowardwLo> and others have a lot, “switch product images”, “apply filters”, “add to wishlist”
[02:19:09] <Cork> as all page have them, and they do basically the same thing
[02:19:48] <Cork> when you get to specific features just one page has, you might want to start adding page specific code in a separate function
[02:19:59] <Cork> but those should be kept common (if they are)
[02:20:04] <HowardwLo> Cork: and then call that function whenever that page is served?
[02:20:15] <Cork> for the pages that has it yes
[02:20:22] <HowardwLo> ah i see, so its a mix
[02:20:27] <HowardwLo> Hmm
[02:20:31] <Cork> well if all have them
[02:20:36] <Cork> no need to redefine them for every page
[02:20:45] <Cork> that would just be a waste
[02:20:49] <HowardwLo> right
[02:21:16] <HowardwLo> and another reason why i used the three sections method, is it made history api a lot easier
[02:21:39] <HowardwLo> i only had to swap content 3 times on popstate, no matter what page they were on or going back to
[02:21:52] <Cork> not sure why you need three
[02:21:54] <Cork> but ok
[02:21:59] <HowardwLo> three, one for each section?
[02:22:03] <HowardwLo> how does it normally work?
[02:22:12] <Cork> i mean i don't see why you need separate sections
[02:22:57] <HowardwLo> Cork: oh. hmm, i think it was because i ajaxed and replaced 3 sections, so it was the most obvious choice to also have pushState handle those three sections, which led to popstate doing three sections as well
[02:23:01] <Cork> i would move out sections that basically never change (only changes classes or so on)
[02:23:04] <Cork> and make them static
[02:23:08] <Cork> and modify them with js
[02:23:18] <Cork> and have a main element that wraps the rest
[02:23:22] <Cork> and just replace all inside it
[02:23:37] <HowardwLo> Cork: they all change from page to page. width wise and display block/none wise
[02:23:50] <Cork> then just send them all in one big html blob
[02:23:54] <Cork> why separate them out?
[02:24:28] <Cork> replaceAll adds quite a bit more complexity to the js then what .html would
[02:24:39] <Cork> as it actually removes the element you target
[02:24:43] <HowardwLo> Cork: hmm. how would you handle the event listeners?
[02:24:48] <HowardwLo> all from the parent?
[02:25:06] <Cork> the static, all parent even handlers i would bind to the "content" element
[02:25:10] <Cork> statically on first page load
[02:25:19] <Cork> every thing else you could add to the elements inside it
[02:25:28] <Cork> when the content is replaced those are removed anyway
[02:25:53] <HowardwLo> when the content is replaced, i would have to call the event handler functions again?
[02:25:55] <Cork> and you might even be able to do something like $('#content').load('url')
[02:25:57] <Cork> and be done with it
[02:27:11] <Cork> HowardwLo: you could so something like $('#content').load(url, function() { window.handlers[$('#content section:first').data('name')](); })
[02:27:42] <Cork> you would have to add a check for if the function exists though
[02:28:09] <Cork> and you prob want a better selector then the '#content seciton:first'
[02:33:20] <HowardwLo> Cork: thanks for the advice
[02:33:32] <HowardwLo> i’ll study more into this before i continue with my js rewrite :|
[02:35:44] <hd1> Cork, ok
[02:59:26] <litropy> Cork, it just occurred to me that @media is CSS3. Are you saying it would respond faster than JS?
[03:02:31] <Cork> litropy: css is declarative
[03:02:44] <Cork> it means it tells the browser "when this happens do this"
[03:02:51] <Cork> so the browser knows what should happen
[03:03:04] <Cork> so it can do the needed changes before it draws the first frame of the new situation
[03:03:09] <Cork> so yes it is much faster
[03:03:24] <litropy> Cork, thank you for taking the time to explain.
[03:03:30] <MacroMan> I'm binding the wheel event to a number box. It has odd behaviour. The wheel event is fired before the value of the box changes, so any code will have the old value. Example: http://jsfiddle.net/pq1r1dhh/
[03:03:39] <Cork> js has to wait for events and on events do dom changes when they match something
[03:03:48] <Cork> that by definition means way after first frame
[03:04:03] <eckyecky> Hello. can this be done BEFORE document.ready() ? var $productBox = $("#product-box"); ?
[03:04:14] <Cork> eckyecky: no
[03:04:21] <Cork> you can't select an element before it exists
[03:04:45] <eckyecky> but I need it inside a function that is outside the document ready section
[03:04:58] <Cork> eckyecky: then you need to move it inside the ready
[03:05:04] <Cork> or call it from inside the ready
[03:05:06] <eckyecky> and now it says undefined, because it's declared outside document tready
[03:05:17] <Cork> ya, cause the element doesn't exist yet
[03:05:17] <eckyecky> put the function in there?
[03:05:36] <Cork> eckyecky: where you define the function doesn't really matter
[03:05:40] <Cork> but from where you call it does
[03:05:41] <eckyecky> can you put functions inside $(document).ready ?
[03:05:51] <Cork> yes, but that isn't the point
[03:06:02] <Cork> what is executing the function?
[03:06:42] <eckyecky> something inside the doc ready that re=arranges some elements on the page, jquery encapsulated elemenents
[03:06:57] <Cork> if it is called from inside the ready function
[03:07:01] <Cork> then the selector would exist
[03:07:11] <Cork> IF the element with the matching id exists from page load
[03:07:11] <MacroMan> Is there an alternative to using the wheel event to capture number input changes on mouse scroll?
[03:07:18] <eckyecky> yes, but
[03:07:25] <MacroMan> neither change() nor blur() do the job
[03:07:34] <Cork> MacroMan: the input even i think
[03:07:41] <eckyecky> should I DECLARE it outside the doc ready then and assign it inside doc ready?
[03:07:58] <Cork> eckyecky: where you declare it doesn't matter
[03:08:13] <Cork> where you declare it just matters for name scope
[03:08:23] <MacroMan> Cork, ah brilliant. Forgot about the input event. Thanks
[03:08:23] <eckyecky> it does if the function outside the doc ready needs the var
[03:08:38] <Cork> again where you declare it doesn't matter
[03:23:17] <uskerine> hi, I have a domain name www.foo.com and an app hosted in www.bar.com that enforces SSL with a bar.com certificate. How could I make www.foo.com point to www.bar.com ensuring that it is a redirection that actually changes the browser URL from www.foo.com to www.bar.com so browser does not raise any certificate warning. Thanks
[03:23:58] <Cork> uskerine: uh, are you sure you asked that in the wrong channel?
[03:24:15] <Cork> i really don't see how it has anything to do with jquery
[03:24:42] <uskerine> Cork I know that this might not apply very well to jquery, but honestly I don't know where to ask it. I think I might have more answers here than in @html. Any suggestions?
[03:25:04] <Cork> uskerine: i don't even follow what the question is
[03:25:24] <Cork> uskerine: as long as the ip of the host matches the ip in the cert
[03:25:26] <Cork> you just link it
[03:25:41] <uskerine> I have a generic certificate matching domain bar.com, not a specific IP
[03:25:56] <Cork> or rather your question sounds like a server configuration question
[03:26:01] <Cork> not a html/js/jquery one
[03:26:21] <Cork> uskerine: bar.com or *.bar.com or www.bar.com?
[03:26:24] <Cork> those arn't the smae
[03:26:27] <Cork> *same
[03:26:30] <uskerine> *.bar.com
[03:26:44] <Cork> ok, then just configure the server to send that cert
[03:27:15] <Cork> uskerine: and by ip, i meant the server config that chooses what cert to send
[03:27:17] <uskerine> It is not a server configuration, the server sends the certificate, but the browsers detect that the certificate is for *.bar.com and the user typed foo.com, so it raises a warning
[03:27:31] <uskerine> I want a redirection which actually changes the browser's URL from foo.com to bar.com
[03:27:36] <Cork> uskerine: you can't use the cert for bar.com for foo.com
[03:27:41] <Cork> no
[03:27:46] <Cork> redirects has nothing to do with it
[03:29:45] <uskerine> ok I still think it does as how it is behaving now, but you are right probably this is not the right place to ask. I will try #ssl and #http. Thanks
[03:30:06] <Cork> uskerine: it sounds like you have a server configuration error
[03:30:17] <Cork> uskerine: so you should ask in a channel for the web server software your using
[03:30:26] <Cork> *you're
[03:30:41] <Cork> not generic web standards channels
[03:32:23] <uskerine> I think it is a matter of choosing the right redirection method/code, nothing related about server configuration
[03:32:36] <uskerine> server is properly configured, you go to www.bar.com and certificate works fine
[03:32:47] <Cork> uskerine: no, the client doesn't select what cert to check the domain against
[03:32:49] <Cork> the server does
[03:33:06] <Cork> when the connection to the server starts it sends the public cert
[03:33:09] <uskerine> but I don't have a foo.com certificate
[03:33:15] <uskerine> I just have a bar.com certificate
[03:33:24] <Cork> the browser checks it against the domain it connected to
[03:33:34] <Cork> and its chain of trusted certs
[03:33:43] <Cork> if the public cert doesn't match the domain
[03:33:51] <Cork> or doesn't lead to a trusted root cert
[03:33:55] <Cork> you get a cert error
[03:34:01] <Cork> it has NOTHING to do with the redirect
[03:34:06] <uskerine> so the browser receives a bar.com  certificate while the URL is for foo.com, so it raises a warning and you have to add an exception. That's why I want a redirection which actually changes URL
[03:34:31] <Cork> uskerine: only if the foo.com was on your domain
[03:34:40] <Cork> if it is't on the same, it isn't the same connection
[03:35:21] <Cork> uskerine: some redirections are blocked cross domains, but that isn't cause of cert warnings
[03:36:02] <uskerine> so you think it is a configuration issue, and not the browser complaining about receiving a certificate for bar.com when user typed foo.com?
[03:36:42] <Cork> it is definitely not cause the cert of the wrong domain doesn't match the domain of the redirect target
[03:36:51] <Cork> but it might be something else
[03:37:52] <Cork> uskerine: btw what browser is this?
[03:38:16] <Cork> if it isn't one of the major ones it could possibly be a bug in there redirect code
[03:38:23] <uskerine> it is firefox
[03:38:23] <Cork> where the old cert leaks into the new connection
[03:38:26] <Cork> then no
[03:45:02] <TTomiK> hey... I've surfed around for hours, but can't think of a solution for sendin POST -data with $.ajax (jQuery that is) to server
[03:45:08] <TTomiK> the strange thing is that even I set the type to POST and submit the form I can find all the stuff sent to server from $_GET (PHP)
[03:45:16] <TTomiK> oh, and running the form on my own computer and the server is running elsewhere
[03:45:18] <TTomiK> any help ?
[03:45:57] <Cork> TTomiK: uh
[03:46:07] <Cork> you really mean send with POST and read with $_GET?
[03:46:17] <Cork> it kinda makes a miss match :)
[03:46:33] <Cork> wither make a GET call and read with $_GET
[03:46:34] <TTomiK> that I'm having type: 'POST' in ajax- call and yet still the data sent is found from GET at the server
[03:46:40] <Cork> or POST and read with $_POST
[03:46:52] <TTomiK> Cork: I know, that's the point... $_POST is empty
[03:46:56] <Cork> ah
[03:47:02] <Cork> TTomiK: check the server log
[03:47:13] <Cork> you most likely have something redirecting the post
[03:47:20] <TTomiK> nope, I don't
[03:47:36] <Cork> and if you inspect the network call in the browser it is marked as a post call?
[03:47:38] <TTomiK> it's a direct call to a php-file with no redirects, but I'll check
[03:48:02] <TTomiK> well, I'm using jquery mobile and it won't show the requests with firebug for some reason
[03:48:20] <Cork> try the built in network tool
[03:48:32] <TTomiK> built in?
[03:48:35] <Cork> ctrl+shift+q
[03:48:49] <TTomiK> ok, I'll test
[03:49:57] <TTomiK> hmm.. the requests are GET
[03:49:59] <TTomiK> wtf
[03:50:17] <Cork> TTomiK: could you pb the ajax call?
[03:50:23] <Cork> meaning the js code
[03:50:35] <TTomiK> yup, I know... just a sec
[03:53:06] <Paradisee> how can i read a json via ajax?
[03:53:20] <Cork> Paradisee: make the server send json
[03:53:25] <TTomiK> Cork: http://pastebin.com/S3nxKaA9
[03:53:26] <Cork> ajax parses it by default
[03:53:45] <Cork> Paradisee: and by "make the server send" i mean set the correct content-type
[03:53:45] <Paradisee> i have to send a request, before to get the json
[03:54:08] <Cork> $.ajax('url-to-json').done(function(json) {})
[03:54:21] <Cork> ah
[03:54:27] <Cork> TTomiK: you can't post jsonp
[03:54:32] <Cork> jsonp is ALWAYS GET
[03:54:45] <TTomiK> well, I've taken them away and put back :)
[03:55:15] <Cork> TTomiK: well they are a blocker to start with
[03:55:27] <TTomiK> Cork: I changed datatype: json and commented json* away
[03:55:30] <Cork> it is impossible to get post with those three set
[03:55:38] <TTomiK> now I immediately get server error -alert, but wait...
[03:55:49] <Cork> also the server has to support answering the OPTION call
[03:55:55] <Cork> else the request will be blocked
[03:56:16] <Cork> (and in the option it has to answer with cors headers allowing you)
[03:56:31] <TTomiK> ah, ok...
[03:56:43] <Cork> if that happens you should get a post call server side
[03:56:58] <Cork> but yes, there is quite a few hoops you need to jump through to do cross domain posts
[03:58:08] <Cork> TTomiK: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Preflighted_requests
[03:58:25] <Cork> TTomiK: also in the future when you have problems like this
[03:58:26] <TTomiK> I have to check the server settings
[03:58:31] <Cork> make sure to mention it is cross domain
[03:58:36] <TTomiK> sorry :)
[03:58:49] <Cork> it creates a completely different ballpark to work in
[03:58:57] <TTomiK> true that
[03:59:19] <TTomiK> I'll play a bit and get back if necessary... Thanks a lot, Cork :)
[03:59:27] <Cork> yw
[04:00:53] <Paradisee> what does __photo__: means?
[04:01:07] <Cork> in what context?
[04:01:46] <Paradisee> when i get the json bac
[04:01:52] <Paradisee> Object {tvs: Object}tvs: Object__proto__: Object
[04:02:05] <Cork> ah, proto not photo :)
[04:02:11] <Paradisee> ya sorry
[04:02:18] <Cork> proto is a short for prototype
[04:02:54] <Cork> and when you inspect objects the browsers developer tools often display that as __proto__
[04:02:59] <Paradisee> how can i iterate over the json?
[04:03:09] <Cork> too generic
[04:03:28] <Cork> json is a string representation of javascript datatypes
[04:03:39] <Cork> after it has been parsed to javascript data
[04:03:45] <Cork> you have either an array or an object
[04:05:07] <TTomiK> Cork: works like a charm and FF's console shows only POST-requests now :)
[04:05:16] <Paradisee> Cork: i know that, but is there a way to show it properly? like in python...
[04:05:23] <tiaou> The server at jquery.com is taking too long to respond.
[04:05:48] <TTomiK> then there's only the testing in phone, it's a phonegap -script
[04:05:56] <Cork> tiaou: seams like one of the cdns are slow
[04:06:44] <tiaou> It's just you. http://jquery.com is up.
[04:06:51] <tiaou> you seam to be right about that.
[04:07:00] <Cork> tiaou: the admins are looking into it
[04:07:11] <tiaou> yes
[04:08:29] <tiaou> cool, code.jquery.com works.
[04:08:34] <tiaou> got what i needed.
[04:08:36] <tiaou> ty
[04:09:26] <Cork> tiaou: sorry i missed that you talked about jqueryui
[04:09:28] <Cork> opps
[04:09:30] <Cork> sorry jquery
[04:09:38] <Paradisee> is there a way to iterate over a json object if i don't know the keys?
[04:09:49] <Cork> the old reports i've seen a little back (and the one they're looking at) is for jqueryui.com
[04:10:30] <tiaou> key(foo[0])
[04:10:33] <Paradisee> Cork: any solution?
[04:11:09] <Cork> Paradisee: it isn't a json object
[04:11:11] <Cork> just an object
[04:11:19] <Cork> "{}" <-- json object
[04:11:24] <Cork> {} <-- object
[04:11:27] <Paradisee> well, so how can i iterate over the object
[04:11:36] <Cork> $.each is the simplest way
[04:11:36] <Paradisee> without know the keys
[04:11:46] <Cork> $.each(obj, function(key, value) {});
[04:12:12] <Paradisee> ty
[04:12:28] <Paradisee> lights Object {light_2: Object, light_1: Object} system.js:13
[04:12:28] <Paradisee> tvs Object {tv_3: Object}
[04:12:32] <Paradisee> that makes sense :D
[04:14:03] <Paradisee> which is the best way to display images? should i put the link inside the json? could be a good idea?
[04:14:26] <Paradisee> can someone ban nettoweb? he is annoying me
[04:14:39] <tiaou>  user-space ban him
[04:14:42] <tiaou> by using /ignore
[04:15:46] <Cork> Paradisee: he sends mesages on join?
[04:15:56] <Paradisee> ya
[04:17:28] <ggdevelop> Hi, how can I make a button that when I click on it, a copy of the text will accure?
[04:17:35] <Cork> Paradisee: hmm, can't reproduce
[04:17:45] <Cork> Paradisee: report it to #freenode so they can ban him from the network
[04:18:27] <arschmitz> tiaou: sorry for any trouble with the websites we have been under pretty constant DDOS attack we are aware and are looking into any problems
[04:19:01] <tiaou> thx
[04:19:47] <arschmitz> tiaou: right now some of it i think is DNS propagation we had to move some things around
[04:27:30] <ggdevelop> I hava div with a text, and I want to copy it. I want that if I open some other windows and push ctl+v it will pase it.
[04:29:20] <Cork> ggdevelop: you mean you want to modify the visitors copy buffer?
[04:35:20] <ggdevelop> Cork:yes
[04:36:24] <Cork> ggdevelop: you could bind a copy event and modify it there
[04:36:38] <Cork> ggdevelop: web doesn't provide direct copybuffer access
[04:39:16] <Cork> ggdevelop: a way around that limitation that some sites use is loading a flash plugin
[04:39:33] <Cork> as it barely have any clipboard security
[04:42:23] <tiaou> i'm a nympho.
[04:42:37] <tiaou> and i do clipboards all day long.
[04:44:02] <shebbi> Hi, see http://jsfiddle.net/7676mLct/1/
[05:02:17] <OnkelTem> Hi. Can anybody explain how .filter() works? I'm giving up...
[05:02:25] <OnkelTem> Should it filter OUT elements matched?
[05:03:03] <OnkelTem> then wth $('a').filter('a') returns all <a> elements instead of []?
[05:04:16] <OnkelTem> http://jsfiddle.net/h3jrzxrf/
[05:05:32] <tiaou> filter
[05:05:50] <tiaou> perhaps the wording isnt perfect
[05:06:00] <tiaou> it returns everything that passes the filter
[05:06:16] <OnkelTem> tiaou: then how it differs from find()?
[05:06:27] <tiaou> so if you're filtering a collection of a with the filter 'a' all you get is [...a...]
[05:07:00] <Cork> OnkelTem: filter gives you the elements that matches the selecor
[05:07:03] <Cork> *selector
[05:07:12] <Cork> OnkelTem: if you want to remove the matches you use .not
[05:07:17] <tiaou> idk, i just can't look it up on the website cause its down but i guess its a difference in complexity and how it gets done
[05:07:30] <Cork> OnkelTem: ('a').not('a') == []
[05:07:55] <Cork> $('*').filter('a') == [a,a,a,a,a];
[05:08:04] <OnkelTem> Cork: the first example from here http://api.jquery.com/filter/  -- $( "li" ).filter( ":even" ).css( "background-color", "red" ); -- saying the color will be applied to 1, 3, 5 - i.e. to odd numbers
[05:08:52] <Cork> OnkelTem: 0 == :even, 1 == :odd
[05:09:14] <Cork> "(recall that :even and :odd use 0-based indexing)."
[05:09:22] <OnkelTem> omg...
[05:09:53] <OnkelTem> brainfucked example, really. Among millions of other examples they took edge cased one :)
[05:10:04] <OnkelTem> and inverted it :)
[05:10:05] <Cork> :)
[05:10:26] <OnkelTem> thanks, now I see. Hope QueryPath implemetned something linke .not()
[05:22:13] <OnkelTem> Cork: so is there any difference between find() and filter() then?
[05:23:03] <Cork> OnkelTem: a big one
[05:23:19] <Cork> OnkelTem: $().filter filters the elements returned by $()
[05:23:45] <Cork> $().find searches for element matching the selector that are a child or grand child of the elements in the $() selector
[05:24:11] <OnkelTem> like including or not including self?
[05:24:16] <Cork> no
[05:24:25] <OnkelTem> Ah, I see
[05:24:27] <Cork> .filter reduces the array returned by $()
[05:24:32] <OnkelTem> $() may refurn ANY set
[05:24:39] <Cork> and .find is a new querySelectorAll
[05:25:03] <Cork> OnkelTem: any set?
[05:25:14] <OnkelTem> any array
[05:25:18] <Cork> no
[05:25:25] <Cork> ok, lets express it like this
[05:25:36] <Cork> $('a') === $(document).find('a')
[05:25:59] <Cork> $('div a') === $(document).find('div').find('a')
[05:26:00] <OnkelTem> find() acts on an element and uses DOM tree to search for, while filter() works with passed set of elements
[05:26:02] <OnkelTem> ?
[05:26:18] <Cork> kinda
[05:26:20] <litropy> On a $(".myclass").each(function(){$(this).animate(),500,function(){}}), how can I tell when the last one has finished? Is this the best way? http://jsfiddle.net/a1x9d7uj/
[05:27:00] <Cork> litropy: $.when($().each()).done
[05:28:46] <litropy> Cork, nice. That's a listener? So, $.when($(.myclass).each(wholefunctiongoeshere)).done { yayitsdone() } ?
[05:29:04] <Cork> litropy: .done is a deferred handler

[05:46:04] <Cork> maZtah: $('*[name="' + decodeURIComponent(miniParts[0]) + '"]').data('autoNumeric')
[05:46:22] <Cork> that is where the plugin goes belly up
[05:47:01] <maZtah> hmm, what is miniParts[0]?
[05:47:08] <Cork> maZtah: read the plugin
[05:47:48] <Cork> but the plugin has broken assumptions
[05:48:00] <Cork> and needs to be fixed to support more then one form per page
[05:48:06] <maZtah> aah, alright
[05:50:43] <end-of-file> Anyone can help me please?
[05:52:19] <Cork> end-of-file: please try to ask the question separate from the background store
[05:52:22] <Cork> *story
[05:52:36] <Cork> makes it much simpler to see if you can answer the question
[05:53:31] <end-of-file> Cork: I have a problem with the height of my content. When you go on MondoBlackBerry and don't wait roll over of content and go to iMondoApple, the content don't cover all news!!!
[05:53:42] <Cork> ...
[05:53:48] <Cork> so the question is?
[05:54:14] <FlyingDog> I, l'm looking to have a popover expand from left to right.  From transparent to opaque
[05:54:19] <end-of-file> Cork: how can I fix my problem? :)
[05:54:43] <end-of-file> Cork: this is my jQuery code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/50be13248d523425f0ed
[06:19:55] <sunbeam> HI, I'm looking for a (paid or not) html5/jquery plugin with which I can draw a postal card design, anyone knows good ones?
[06:21:11] <decx> what 2 columns with a couple of lines?
[06:21:51] <Cork> i doubts there is a read made complete plugin
[06:22:00] <Cork> plugins is normally building blocks
[06:22:12] <Cork> *ready made
[06:23:41] <decx> i dont even understand the concept
[06:24:07] <decx> an online editor to create print files?
[06:24:14] <Cork> decx: most likely design of the backside of the card
[06:24:43] <decx> so it is about 2 columns with a couple of lines :D
[06:24:59] <Cork> decx: that i would call the front
[06:25:06] <Cork> but ya, :)
[06:25:14] <Cork> i meant the photo/image
[06:25:20] <Cork> but only guessing
[06:26:32] <decx> backside is the two columns btw
[06:27:17] <Paradisee> how can i load an image with jquery in a proper content <div> ?
[06:28:00] <Cork> Paradisee: either set a css background-image
[06:28:04] <Cork> or add an <img> tag
[06:28:12] <Paradisee> Cork: its dinamically
[06:28:27] <Cork> its still what the way
[06:28:48] <Cork> if it is generated from a canvas you have to convert it to a blob first
[06:29:18] <Cork> what the way???
[06:29:28] <Paradisee> Cork: i get the image url from the json, so i have to put the image into a div dinamically...
[06:29:29] <Cork> *it's still the way
[06:29:46] <Cork> Paradisee: so either set css background-image
[06:29:49] <Cork> or add an img tag
[06:30:07] <Paradisee> Cork: i can't know how many images will be loaded
[06:30:14] <Cork> ok?
[06:30:24] <Cork> Paradisee: it is STILL the way you have to do it
[06:30:28] <Cork> there is no other way
[06:30:46] <Paradisee> should i put 100000000 img tags?
[06:30:49] <Jardayn> I have a page that will be populated by data. Where do i put this query ?{{ $user = DB::table('shipments')->where('id', Session::get('id')}}
[06:31:08] <Cork> Paradisee: uh, you add the img tag as needed
[06:31:19] <Cork> you don't pre add the tags
[06:31:41] <Cork> Jardayn: most likely wrong channel
[06:31:50] <Jardayn> yup
[06:31:54] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/28ZBYX0
[06:31:56] <Paradisee> line 14
[06:31:58] <Jardayn> oop
[06:32:00] <Jardayn> oops
[06:33:58] <Cork> Paradisee: .done(function(json) { var images = $.map(json, function(key, val) { return $('<img>', { src: val })[0]; }); }); $('#target').append(images); });
[06:34:25] <Cork> hmm looks like i make one }); too many there
[06:34:36] <Cork> anyway that is how you do it
[06:36:50] <Paradisee> wut
[06:42:40] <Paradisee> Cork: http://dpaste.com/1S422BZ
[06:42:44] <Paradisee> this is the json i have
[06:46:53] <decx> same concept
[06:46:58] <decx> cork gave you anything you need
[06:47:07] <decx> everything
[06:49:47] <Jagst3r21> I am trying to get a textarea to show up when you click on the li with the class "option-1-down", but I can't seem to get it working
[06:49:53] <Jagst3r21> here is my code thus far http://jsfiddle.net/SCuRn/16/
[06:50:04] <FlyingDog> Hi, l'm looking to have a popover expand from left to right.  From transparent to opaque
[06:50:07] <FlyingDog> Like if the text says "TEXT HERE" I want it to open up like "TEX", "TEXT H", "TEXT HERE" with the background expanding inline with the text. Thanks
[06:50:50] <decx> Jagst3r21 hasClass returns a boolean and not the object
[06:51:13] <Jagst3r21> oh
[06:51:19] <sunbeam> Cork: yes thats what I ment
[06:51:27] <sunbeam> designing the backside of a postal card
[06:51:37] <sunbeam> I'm looking for a plugin with which I can accomplish that
[06:52:05] <Jagst3r21> decx so what should I use instead?
[06:53:41] <decx> so you have 3 textareas that should be shown when you clicks its corresponding li?
[06:54:37] <Jagst3r21> decx the textarea should only show up when you click on the li with the class "option-1-down" and should hide when you click on any other li
[06:55:12] <end-of-file> I guys I have a CSS problem. If you go to http://www.mondoblackberry.com/test-page-menu-news/ I have a little bug. If you go on MondoBlackBerry and later on iMondoApple without waiting slider rollover, the content background don't cover all news. I've tried to set min-height without any success. This is my code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/eb7bef3f7f525bf20929 this is my jQuery: https://gist
[06:55:12] <end-of-file> .github.com/anonymous/d8123d4d35306a13619e
[06:55:44] <decx> Jagst3r21 then i dont get why you have $('#'+target)
[06:56:21] <end-of-file> I have in my JS a function on 130 line for hide previous item and apply his height back but it seems didn't work
[06:57:16] <Jagst3r21> decx oh right
[06:57:20] <Jagst3r21> hold on let me try something
[06:59:54] <Jagst3r21> decx more like this or no? http://jsfiddle.net/SCuRn/17/
[07:00:09] <Jagst3r21> http://jsfiddle.net/SCuRn/18/ rather
[07:00:46] <FlyingDog> Hi, does anyone know how to solve my issue? I've exhauseted my options trying to achieve that
[07:01:28] <decx> Jagst3r21 well put a dot before your feedback selector and it'll do
[07:01:46] <Jagst3r21> woops
[07:01:47] <Jagst3r21> :)
[07:02:50] <Jagst3r21> decx hmm it works, but it obviously shows both textareas...http://jsfiddle.net/SCuRn/19/
[07:03:00] <Jagst3r21> not sure how to only show the 1
[07:03:09] <decx> instead of 2 hasclass you can do .is('.class1, .class2')
[07:04:49] <end-of-file> Any people could help me please?
[07:07:11] <decx> i would have to copy and paste your separated link and i'm lazy
[07:08:29] <decx> Jagst3r21 http://jsfiddle.net/SCuRn/22/
[07:08:50] <Jagst3r21> thanks but I was trying to do it myself XD
[07:08:57] <Jagst3r21> appreciate the help though
[07:09:15] <decx> it's just one way that isnt even that thought out
[07:09:23] <decx> there's plenty of opportunity to make it better
[07:09:31] <Jagst3r21> alright, cool
[07:10:14] <decx> for example you can go through all your feedback activators and bind their feedback textareas to them on load, that way you dont need to traverse on click
[07:10:16] * hlvwrk slaps Jagst3r21 with a fish
[07:10:50] <Jagst3r21> ok thanks
[08:01:40] <aftab> Hello, is there a way to stop all clicks until the page is loaded because the href for my anchor tag is "#" and it is supposed to send request through ajax but whenever I click on it before the page loads it goes to home page.
[08:02:04] <aftab> I just want that click event to go into the queue and wait until the page is loaded
[08:02:48] <mendozao> When creating a custom event, is there a way to attach event data directly on the jquery event object? Right now in order to get at the attached data, I need to do e.originalEvent.myData
[08:07:12] <Desode> aftab: $( document ).ready(function() {} should do the trick right?
[08:07:51] <coxaLT> Hello
[08:08:12] <coxaLT> Is there somewhere a list of main or all jquery plugins with their file names?
[08:09:49] <decx> google
[08:10:30] <Desode> coxaLT: http://plugins.jquery.com/  offers a pretty comprehensive list
[08:11:25] <aftab> Desode: yes I have put the $(document).on("click",function () {}); event inside document.ready function and checking if it works or not :)
[08:11:45] <noord_> how to organize a complex flow lots of events states and modal etc
[08:11:48] <noord_> ?
[08:12:56] <Desode> I've got a bit of a peculiar problem: I have a list of anchor links which when clicked scroll to their corresponding target (localscroll/scrollto). However, when I click the anchor, the id attribute of the target is stripped, only to reappear about 2 seconds after. Any idea what could be causing this?
[08:15:34] <w00tb3ast> I am using http://www.dropzonejs.com/ for a drag / drop image uploader, just wondering is it possible to re-initialize the url component of something like this when a value changes?
[08:16:21] <BillCriswell> Desode: Hard to tell without looking at the code.
[08:17:40] <Desode> BillCriswell: I could upload my dev site (it's CMS-based so I can't just lop off some part)
[08:19:35] <BillCriswell> Just the relevant code should be enough though. Lik a small example on jsbin.com
[08:33:28] <Desode> BillCriswell: I'll try to cut out the relevant parts but the problem is visible here in full glory: http://edged.nl/jquery (click on the top navbar items)
[08:35:33] <BillCriswell> Desode: Ugh, Drupal.
[08:35:43] <BillCriswell> Desode: I'm not seeing the id's disappear.
[08:36:16] <BillCriswell> Wait yes I do.
[08:36:45] <Uhkis> why does this channel always bash on drupal
[08:37:19] <Desode> I dont know, what's wrong with it?
[08:38:25] <BillCriswell> block block-block block--foo-block-menu-block-foo-fuck
[08:38:40] <Desode> Oh that shit is fixable toward the end :)
[08:38:44] <Desode> But most people dont bother with it..
[08:39:10] <Uhkis> oh the profanities!
[08:39:51] <BillCriswell> I just simply don't like it. I think the admin is terrible and working with it as a front-end guy just doesn't feel good.
[08:40:14] <BillCriswell> Desode: What is "colio
[08:40:15] <BillCriswell> "
[08:40:28] <Desode> its that portfolio thing
[08:40:38] <Desode> it sounds kinda like a disease :(
[08:41:15] <BillCriswell> Salk is too dead to cure it.
[08:42:12] <BillCriswell> Desode: Try commenting out the colion js or something and see if you still exhibit that behavoir. The scrolling should not be causing ids and shit ti disappear.
[08:43:19] <Desode> that's what I thought, I'll filter out colio, hold on
[08:47:53] <Desode> BillCriswell: It should be gone now (style will be a bit more messy) It still exhibits the behavior
[09:01:34] <BillCriswell> Desode: I thought it would be a bit more obvious but no luck.
[09:07:31] <chealer> hi. I'm trying to debug a page which displays a popup when I click a button. I see that there's a mouseup event listener on the page which must explain why this popup appears, but I fail to find what defines this listener. the listener is jQuery and is already there when the page is done loading.
[09:08:03] <chealer> This is not necessarily jQuery-specific, but how can I debug what happens when a page loads? I would like to step through all the JavaScript which executes automatically. I use the latest Firefox with Firebug but I am open to trying other browsers if needed.
[09:18:36] <YammYcoding> good morning
[09:19:01] <YammYcoding> how I place a this instead?    $( '.datepicker').each( function() {   var dp = $( '.datepicker.mindate input.form-control' )[0].val; }
[09:20:47] <YammYcoding> possible?
[09:30:28] <Desode> BilCriswell: You have my thanks for trying though!  I'll see if I can get it solved
[09:33:53] <Paradisee_> http://dpaste.com/2FQQR4A
[09:33:54] <Paradisee_> line 15
[09:35:20] <BillCriswell> Paradisee_: .css({top: value.position_top, left: value.position_left, position: 'absolute' });
[09:35:57] <Desode> you beat me to it :)
[09:36:25] <Paradisee_> it doesnt work
[09:36:54] <BillCriswell> Paradisee_: Everything I knew about CSS was a lie I guess.
[09:37:25] <Paradisee_> im just telling what you said
[09:38:13] <BillCriswell> Hm?
[09:38:31] <Paradisee_> i tried it into my code, and it doesnt work
[09:40:27] <BillCriswell> Paradisee_: http://jsbin.com/vuxizahahobi/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[09:43:19] <Paradisee_> it has to be relative to a div...
[09:43:43] <BillCriswell> It would be relative to the body if I didn't build the container.
[09:44:08] <BillCriswell> so it should have at least come close to working.
[09:46:38] <decx> why can you append() a $.map object but not appendTo() from a mapobject
[09:47:14] <decx> well i know why, but why
[09:48:18] <BillCriswell> decx: gnarf was talking about that a few nights ago. It's weird because appendTo basically calls append as well.
[09:48:44] <BillCriswell> append() and take a function, appendTo can't. Maybe something to do with that?
[09:48:59] <decx> like in your jsbin
[09:49:16] <BillCriswell> What did I do?
[09:49:28] <decx> instead of each you can map the json to an <img> array and append that
[09:49:55] <decx> http://jsbin.com/vuxizahahobi/3/edit
[09:49:55] <BillCriswell> Ah, yeah... maybe I was trying to make it easier to follow?
[09:49:57] <chealer> Learning Center appears to be down.
[09:50:00] <BillCriswell> My ucking head is killing me.
[09:50:23] <decx> i just played around with map and noticed i cant directly appendTo
[09:50:38] <tw2113> you should tranquilizer it BillCriswell
[09:50:50] <BillCriswell> tw2113: Is that code for medicine?
[09:51:34] <Desode> Tranquilize.. that word always makes me imagine someone getting a sedative dart to the face hehe
[09:52:08] <tw2113> in this case, given that it's bill's head?very plausable
[09:53:22] <BillCriswell> I think I could take a dart to the face at this point.
[09:53:26] <BillCriswell> Couldn't hurt much less.
[09:53:54] <decx> do some stretching
[09:54:51] <decx> stand up, look left, hold right arm to the body and then stretch your right hand 90deg away
[09:55:02] <decx> then the same on the other side
[09:55:45] <Paradisee_> it seems to be relative to the body :/
[09:55:53] <BillCriswell> decx: I do a lot of stretching already. I think I might just be tired somehow. I feel like I slept well, though.
[09:56:09] <BillCriswell> Paradisee_: The element you want to position based off of needs to have: position: relative;
[09:56:41] <Paradisee_> it will displayed downside
[09:56:50] <decx> helps when i get headaches
[09:58:19] <BillCriswell> decx: I rarely get them, like twice a year tops, but when I do I feel some kind of monster is trying to exit through my forehead haha
[09:59:04] <decx> yeah 2 times a year max for me too since i stopped playing handball competitively
[09:59:13] <decx> eheh tit
[10:02:51] <Paradisee_> http://dpaste.com/3JTKXRH
[10:02:52] <Paradisee_> :/
[10:03:35] <decx> what's with the 2 ajax?
[10:03:49] <decx> nevermind i dont want to know
[10:03:54] <Paradisee_> xD
[10:04:07] <BillCriswell> lol
[10:04:12] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee_ heh you should probably learn how to use a step debugger at this point.
[10:04:41] <Paradisee_> robertmaxrees: i just need to correctly position an image when i load it with json
[10:05:18] <BillCriswell> You're using a variable named images, images is not defined in your code.
[10:05:32] <BillCriswell> The dev console would tell you that.
[10:05:35] <robertmaxrees> the variable image, on the other hand...
[10:05:45] <Paradisee_> BillCriswell: what are you talking about?
[10:06:05] <BillCriswell> I can't say it any clearer.
[10:06:20] <BillCriswell> You're doing images.css but you didn't define images.
[10:06:22] <Paradisee_> there's no var called images
[10:06:34] <BillCriswell> You're running .css on it though.
[10:06:36] <Paradisee_> forgot to change
[10:06:39] <Paradisee_> but its the same
[10:06:52] <Paradisee_> it won't display like it should
[10:07:55] <BillCriswell> Paradisee_: inspect the elements in your dev tools. Look to see what the script is doing to them.
[10:08:45] <Paradisee_> <img src="http://0.0.0.0:5000/static/images/light.png" style="top: 127px; left: 334.515625px; position: relative;">
[10:09:11] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee_ sounds like the parent container isn't styled correctly then.
[10:10:26] <Paradisee_> so?
[10:11:21] <robertmaxrees> lol welcome to CSS?
[10:11:25] <robertmaxrees> the cascade is a thing ;)
[10:11:29] <gnarf> decx: try a jQuery(array).map() object instead
[10:11:31] <BillCriswell> Paradisee_: With CSS, like many things involving computers, need to be done in very specific ways.
[10:11:44] <Mag-neto> hey friends! how can i work with .load() function
[10:12:41] <decx> might as well use append(mapped) then gnarf, the lack of the appendTo method on mapobjects should just be an oversight
[10:12:48] <Mag-neto> when I am using this it show that loading is successful but can't open the file i want to open with .click() function
[10:13:07] <robertmaxrees> Mag-neto you mean the thing you setup with .click() doesn't work?
[10:13:17] <gnarf> decx: except $.map returns an array
[10:13:24] <gnarf> and $.fn.map() returns a jQuery
[10:13:25] <Mag-neto> @robertmaxrees ya
[10:13:28] <decx> then again mapping to an array of elements is esoteric
[10:13:37] <decx> gnarf true
[10:14:11] <gnarf> jQuery(images).map(function(index,el) { return DOMElement; }).appendTo('.container');
[10:14:22] <robertmaxrees> Mag-neto use event delegation instead.
[10:14:50] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[10:15:04] <decx> gnarf right i forgot that $.map(array, fn) doesnt get the "not a true array" treatment that fn.map gets
[10:15:36] <sargas> how do I remove a property of a jquery object that was added with fn.exted() ?
[10:15:44] <decx> it all makes sense again
[10:16:01] <gnarf> decx: http://jsbin.com/vuxizahahobi/5/edit?html,css,js,output
[10:16:13] <gnarf> sargas?
[10:16:22] <gnarf> sargas: if it's on jQuery.fn it's on every object
[10:17:14] <sargas> I know... I created a plugin and called it on various jquery objects
[10:17:29] <Mag-neto> @robertmaxrees ok i'll try  but when i try to find to reason for not working with .load() function i found that the file you want to open with .load() function should be on the server
[10:17:31] <sargas> is there a way to remove it?
[10:17:46] <robertmaxrees> Mag-neto huh?
[10:17:48] <Mag-neto> is it matter??
[10:18:06] <robertmaxrees> Mag-neto that has nothing to do with your problem - you're adding content after you try to bind to it with .click() - isn't that your issue?
[10:18:08] <sargas> gnarf: I want to remove it from the jquery obejcts I called it on
[10:18:28] <decx> sargas if you use $.fn.myfun it doesnt matter if you call it, it'll be appended to all the things
[10:18:28] <gnarf> sargas: you realize that $('#id') !=== $('#id') ?
[10:18:46] <Mag-neto> yes that the issue
[10:18:55] <robertmaxrees> Mag-neto then you need to use event delegation.
[10:19:28] <Mag-neto> ok wait i'll be back
[10:19:58] <gnarf> sargas: you could use like this.data() to store a "i ran" flag and stop it form running twice on the same element
[10:19:59] <gnarf> but like
[10:20:01] <gnarf> post some code
[10:20:09] <gnarf> you're prolly "doing it wrong™"
[10:20:59] <sargas> gnarf: I do, but if I do a = $('#id') then they should be the same as on
[10:21:02] <sargas> a === a
[10:21:06] <sargas> gnarf: right?
[10:21:24] <BillCriswell> sargas: No two jQuery objects are the same.
[10:21:37] <gnarf> yes - you shouldn't ever want to remove or attach methods to individual jQuery object
[10:22:02] <BillCriswell> sargas: $('#id').get() === $('#id').get(), but $('#id') !== $('#id')
[10:22:13] <sargas> gnarf: I see, thanks
[10:22:20] <sargas> BillCriswell: that's helpful thanks
[10:22:47] <sargas> now I just need to figure out how to stop my recursive calls to the plugin I wrote
[10:22:51] <gnarf> sargas: i could probably suggest a different "method" if you could show some code
[10:22:53] <decx> there is also is() to see if a is b
[10:22:58] <sargas> I haven't figured out a good technique to do this yet
[10:23:15] <sargas> gnarf: let me create a gist, thanks for the help
[10:23:31] <BillCriswell> decx: Ah ice, didn't realize is took a jquery object.
[10:25:10] <BillCriswell> Can my head simply explode naturally?
[10:25:10] <gnarf> (i'm also on an airplane, so maybe someone else ends up looking too)
[10:26:27] <decx> if you help someone with a technical problem from a plane, is that the mile nye club?
[10:27:06] <gnarf> decx: been a member a few times over on this plane already
[10:27:10] <gnarf> i already fixed blog.jquery.com
[10:27:14] <gnarf> and other random shit
[10:27:28] <decx> you da real mvp
[10:27:36] <robertmaxrees> gnarf++
[10:27:41] <decx> first time i havent used that ironically
[10:27:53] <gnarf> 6 hour flight over to LAX from BOS

[10:28:25] <sargas> gnarf: That's the plugin, then its implementation on myPage.coffee
[10:28:31] <decx> http://i.imgur.com/B5Mjje1.png there is non pepe silva!
[10:28:35] <decx> *no
[10:28:42] <sargas> BillCriswell: feel free to see my plugin if you want as well
[10:28:46] <sargas> BillCriswell: https://gist.github.com/andradei/0677cd9f24037251fb6f

[10:29:20] <gnarf> down in here
[10:29:35] <gnarf> store your "plugin instance" on the elements .data()
[10:29:44] <gnarf> then check for it before "recreating" a new one
[10:31:18] <sargas> gnarf: this concept is new to me, let me try
[10:33:26] <Desode> ugh how hard can it be to debug something which shouldnt happen in the first place
[10:34:11] <gnarf> sargas: might want to read http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/stateful-plugins-with-widget-factory/

[10:39:53] <Mag-neto> @robertmaxrees hey here is code take a look
[10:40:08] <Mag-neto> $(document).ready(function(){
[10:40:09] <Mag-neto>   $("body").delegate("button","click",function(){
[10:40:09] <Mag-neto>     $("button").load("s1.html");
[10:40:09] <Mag-neto>   });
[10:40:09] <Mag-neto> });
[10:40:13] <robertmaxrees> no.
[10:40:15] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ Mag-neto
[10:40:15] <b-ot> Mag-neto: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:40:20] <gnarf> sargas: also http://gnarf.net/widget-factory/ :)
[10:40:27] <Mag-neto> ok i am doing
[10:40:38] <robertmaxrees> also don't use .delegate, use .on
[10:41:00] <robertmaxrees> btw don't prepend usernames with @ - most clients will autonotify if you just use the name.
[10:41:14] <decx> do you want to fill your button with the content of s1.html because that's how you fill your button with the contents of s1.html
[10:41:42] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, that's not a valid thing to do.
[10:41:58] <Mag-neto> http://jsfiddle.net/c00ggr8q/
[10:42:15] <robertmaxrees> Mag-neto where do yu want content to show up on the page?
[10:42:47] <Mag-neto> when user click on the search button then after the button tag
[10:43:00] <Mag-neto> i want to show the content
[10:43:19] <decx> in the button?
[10:43:23] <robertmaxrees> $('button').load() is trying to load the content into the button tag - that doesn't work.
[10:43:41] <decx> observe http://jsfiddle.net/c00ggr8q/1/
[10:44:30] <decx> why did fiddle change its urls /show now shows the ugly results frameset.
[10:44:31] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/c00ggr8q/ Mag-neto do something like this instead.
[10:44:49] <decx> somebody didnt save or copy
[10:44:53] <robertmaxrees> woops wrong.
[10:45:11] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/c00ggr8q/2/ there we go.
[10:54:17] <Mag-neto> hey robertmaxrees
[10:54:25] <Mag-neto> i can't
[10:54:38] <Mag-neto> it's not working
[10:54:54] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't really help me very much ;)
[10:55:11] <Mag-neto> should i use .txt file with .load() function
[10:55:42] <robertmaxrees> are you using a server of sime kind or just opening a file off your hard drive?
[10:56:27] <Mag-neto> opening a file from my hard drive
[10:56:38] <robertmaxrees> you need to use a server of some kind.
[10:56:55] <robertmaxrees> you can't open arbitrary files from your hard drive.
[10:57:29] <Mag-neto> i don't know about the how i do that
[10:57:34] <Mag-neto> any kind of help
[10:57:36] <Mag-neto> ??
[10:58:07] <robertmaxrees> could you clarify what you're doing all of this for?
[10:58:08] <NoiseEee> Mag-neto: you simply cannot load a file from a users system; they have to deliberately choose it themselves
[10:58:20] <jthomp> Mag-neto: Try XAMPP https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
[10:58:49] <robertmaxrees> you could also do a simple node server.
[10:58:55] <Mag-neto> like
[10:59:00] <jthomp> true
[10:59:02] <Mag-neto> ?
[11:01:19] <Mag-neto> can i use any file's url instead of using file from hard drive which is already available on web
[11:01:32] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[11:01:41] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to accomplish?
[11:06:57] <Mag-neto> i try to write a code for my collage library for which when anyone search about any subject it show the list of available books in the library
[11:07:23] <robertmaxrees> you should setup a backend search sytem first, then.
[11:08:36] <Mag-neto> firstly i just doing when user select the subject from predefined list it show the result
[11:09:44] <Hypfer> I have a "web service" running locally which is basically socat/netcat outputting a value. I want to use this value in a jquery page, however the .get method doesn't work because cross domain origin
[11:09:46] <Mag-neto> for this i have written the rest of code but now problem is that i am not able to open the file when user click on the search button()
[11:10:18] <robertmaxrees> Mag-neto right because you have to serve the file up using a webserver of some kind, since you can't arbitrarily load files off of hard drives.
[11:10:35] <robertmaxrees> the library should already have a server setup for their site, right?
[11:10:43] <Mag-neto> ya
[11:10:57] <Mag-neto> i'll go for it now
[11:11:39] <robertmaxrees> setup your search backend and figure out how to output the data you need first.  then use jquery to hit that and render out the content,.
[11:12:35] <robertmaxrees> Hypfer then put the page and service on the same domain.
[11:13:24] <Hypfer> robertmaxrees: the port differs.
[11:13:32] <robertmaxrees> then you need to put them on the same port.
[11:13:41] <Hypfer> *sigh*
[11:13:44] <jyg> Hmmm, thought I'd see some chatter about jqueryui.com being unavailable.
[11:14:00] <robertmaxrees> jyg up for me.
[11:14:11] <jyg> even more hmmming
[11:14:13] <robertmaxrees> Hypfer same port, protocol, and domain.
[11:14:19] <jyg> weird
[11:14:28] <robertmaxrees> might be a DNS caching problem on your end.
[11:14:34] <Mag-neto> thanks for your help robertmaxrees
[11:14:40] <robertmaxrees> Mag-neto yep.
[11:15:16] <jyg> robertmaxrees, what ip do you get for jqueryui.com?
[11:15:36] <jyg> i look at jquery.com and jquerymobile.com and they are on the same C class
[11:15:44] <jyg> jqueryui.com is on a completely different A class
[11:15:54] <robertmaxrees> iirc they had to move the sites.
[11:15:57] <robertmaxrees> try clearing you dns cache.
[11:16:03] <robertmaxrees> *your
[11:16:15] <jyg> hmm ok. don't think I've ever been there on this computer, so it might be our dns servers :p
[11:16:29] <jyg> actually, if you can tell me the real IP I can just put it in my hosts file :D
[11:16:44] <jyg> or i suppose i could nslookup with norec from the top
[11:18:23] <jyg> 173.245.58.128?
[11:20:42] <jyg> nope... 104.16.3.14
[11:22:19] <jyg> yep :)
[11:27:26] <decx> is that server in germany?
[11:27:30] <decx> 19ms
[11:46:22] <Katharsis> i'm using leaflet for maps, which of the plugins will be the best for searching streets and names (OSM)?
[11:48:31] <Kartagis> Katharsis: #leaflet
[11:49:13] <Katharsis> Kartagis: yeah, nobody answer
[11:49:39] <robertmaxrees> Katharsis you'll still probably have better luck over there :)
[11:50:06] <decx> til that you two are not the same person
[11:52:50] <Paradisee_> that's what happen: http://postimg.org/image/kpntbf08f/
[11:53:17] <Paradisee_> when i put some icons on the map, and i reload the page, they will display relative to the body, and not to the container
[12:01:10] <Dramors> Hey people, quick little question
[12:01:20] <Dramors> if I have an <a> element without a href attribute
[12:01:31] <Dramors> do I still need to do the e.preventDefault() on click?
[12:01:44] <decx> no
[12:01:57] <Dramors> alright, thanks
[12:25:38] <abishek> is there a way to mention a timeout for $.post?
[12:26:31] <marc_v92> abishek: Should be in the docs.
[12:26:34] <marc_v92> abishek: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/#jQuery-ajax-settings
[12:26:39] <marc_v92> Scroll down to timeout
[12:27:07] <abishek> marc_v92, i looked at the docs and see the timeout for $.ajax, but how do I do it for $.post?
[12:28:13] <Cork> abishek: why not just use $.ajax?
[12:28:17] <marc_v92> abishek: Ahh, I see. I don’t believe $.post has it. $.post is just shorthand for $.ajax with dataType set to post.
[12:28:28] <Cork> the syntax is basically the same, except you have the alternative option for $.ajax
[12:29:02] <abishek> Cork, understand. just wanted to know if $.post supported it.
[12:32:12] <abishek> if I under $.ajax to set timeout, is there a way to mention as unlimited?
[12:32:39] <Cork> no
[12:33:10] <Cork> a network connection can't be untimed
[12:33:24] <Cork> or rather an http connection can't be
[12:34:09] <abishek> so mentioning as a large number is the only way?
[12:34:18] <Cork> yes
[12:41:43] <jyg> Is there a way to keep a sortable list from bouncing vertically when dragging an item?
[12:59:31] <Desode> If someone's feeling helpful: I can't find out why when I click on my anchor menu links the id attribute of my target item briefly disappears (which results in the flickering style) (I'm using  the scrollto and localscroll plugins)
[13:36:32] <ottoman2> http://jsfiddle.net/3tsLd227/ Is there some way to get the name of the tag with correct case? I.e. MyTag instead of MYTAG?
[13:36:52] <robertmaxrees> that's the tagname according to the DOM
[13:37:10] <robertmaxrees> you could always .toLower() everything before making comparisons
[13:37:39] <Cork> robertmaxrees: you prob missed the xml string
[13:37:48] <Cork> <MyTag> <--
[13:37:51] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:38:02] <robertmaxrees> html != xml
[13:38:11] <robertmaxrees> the DOM apis for html are funky.
[13:38:15] <Cork> and html/xml != dom :)
[13:38:17] <ottoman2> My goal is to draw chart of the xml, and would like to present it with correct case (since XML is case sensitive).
[13:38:41] <ottoman2> And I just assumed that parseXML would give me XML, but that may not be the case..?
[13:39:20] <robertmaxrees> you're creating a document fragment with $( xmlDoc ), which is probably killing you, since that's pushing the whole thing through the DOM, which uppercases tagnames iirc.
[13:39:24] <robertmaxrees> but i could be off there,'
[13:41:34] <ottoman2> So, the short answer is probably: Dont use jQuery for this?
[13:41:49] <robertmaxrees> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/3811
[13:41:50] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:42:14] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/6878994/923919
[13:42:28] <unnu> is there an easy way to selecting the child elements of a spefific value in xml?
[13:42:45] <Cork> unnu: xpath?
[13:42:50] <unnu> ?
[13:42:59] <unnu> i tried :contains
[13:43:00] <Cork> or do you mean with jquery?
[13:43:03] <unnu> with jquery
[13:43:05] <Cork> ah
[13:43:09] <alaing> hey Cork
[13:43:21] <unnu> :contains didn't seem to work . . .
[13:43:29] <Cork> :contains basically converts the content of the element to a string and makes an indexOf in the string
[13:43:41] <ottoman2> robertmaxrees, thanks. Not what I wanted, since I'm done with the rest of the implementation ;) But I'll guess I have to rewrite it in pure JS then.
[13:43:43] <unnu> if my xml is <states><state><name>Alabama</name><abv>AL</abv><counties><county>Autauga County</county></counties></state></states>      and i have $xml as the xml containg it, how would i .find the state with the name="alabama" and grab each of the counties?
[13:43:45] <Cork> you should avoid it as much as possible
[13:44:11] <robertmaxrees> ottoman2 the problem is that jquery speaks html dom just fine, but xml dom is... a little different.  sorry!
[13:44:32] <robertmaxrees> and with that, lunch.  enjoy folks.
[13:44:50] <unnu> $(data).find('states state name:contains("'+state+'")').find('counties county').each().text(); was what i tried
[13:44:51] <Cork> unnu: $xml.find('name').filter(function() { return $(this).html() == 'alabama'; })
[13:45:17] <unnu> filter eh?
[13:45:32] <Cork> its a cleaner way to do basically what :contains does
[13:45:40] <unnu> okay
[13:46:05] <unnu> because i am still trying to get a html select populated with options of the state selected
[13:46:15] <unnu> and the closest i could get the code to do was ALL the counties
[13:46:25] <unnu> not just the ones for that state lol
[13:46:45] <Cork> unnu: personally i would prob just try to get the xml converted to json
[13:46:52] <Cork> much MUCH easier to work with
[13:47:02] <unnu> how?
[13:47:12] <Cork> updating the api?
[13:47:13] <unnu> i can't install addons on the servers, but if something has a CDN i can do that
[13:47:14] <Cork> :)
[13:47:33] <unnu> stupid wordpress, idk how to use the stuff
[13:48:03] <unnu> took me two days to figure out i had to use $j instead of $
[13:48:12] <unnu> im not proud of that, but yeah . . .
[13:48:17] <Cork> unnu: xml is a pain to use
[13:48:19] <Cork> it always has
[13:48:36] <Cork> cause it has a markup that doens't map to normal data structures
[13:48:50] <unnu> well, i have this XML doc, you think if i put it in a sqlite db and made a ajax call to it it would be easier?
[13:49:51] <unnu> return a json array from php and then .each() it to append the $('<option></option>') to the select
[13:49:53] <unnu> imma try that
[13:50:00] <Cork> unnu: if you have to use xml it is prob easier to just use that
[13:50:05] <unnu> okay
[13:50:06] <Cork> but ya, xml is a pain
[13:50:44] <Cork> unnu: and ya, you will most likely have to loop the xml structures
[13:51:13] <unnu> so .filter(function() {return $j(this).html() == state;}) sounds about right?
[13:51:31] <Cork> html or text should work ya
[13:51:41] <unnu> i will try it out and let you know
[13:52:09] <unnu> now when i .find do i have to go down the xml tree? meaning parent element, child, child of that child
[13:52:19] <unnu> or can i just put .find('name')
[13:53:01] <Cork> if that is the only element with the name "name"; sure
[14:01:07] <unnu> Cork, if i give you a link to the XML can you help me for a min?
[14:01:24] <Cork> sure
[14:01:29] <unnu> b/c its grabbing the state's name, but not the counties for that state
[14:01:32] <unnu> pm okay?
[14:02:06] <Cork> sure
[14:12:00] <unnu> Cork, I am trying to populate the Counties with the counties from the xml under the  state that is selected
[14:12:34] <Cork> ah
[14:13:13] <unnu> sorry about pm, i thought you said sure to me pming you
[14:13:14] <stack> maybe this channel is more active, I was wondering if there is any method to create a thumbnail of an image through a web worker, I have really big (20MB) images to manipulate and using the standard canvas method hangs the main thread
[14:15:21] <unnu> why not resize the image stack?
[14:17:14] <robertmaxrees> also: what sort of browser support do you need?
[14:17:16] <NoiseEee> stack: where are those images coming from?
[14:17:36] <NoiseEee> (sidenote, this is why cameras focusing on megapixels instead of better lenses SUCK)
[14:17:54] <robertmaxrees> ^ this all day every day
[14:21:48] <Cork> unnu: http://jsbin.com/febudivecufe/1/edit
[14:22:41] <unnu> Aight Cork
[14:24:33] <unnu> wow Cork, can you translate?
[14:24:45] <Cork> ajax call
[14:24:55] <Cork> the call makes it an xml document by default
[14:25:03] <Cork> then find all name with a parent of state
[14:25:19] <Cork> filter out the state elements matching the 'Florida' string
[14:25:34] <Cork> find the sibling 'counties' of that element
[14:25:42] <Cork> and list all its children
[14:25:59] <stack> NoiseEee: from a file the user chooses
[14:26:28] <Cork> make an array of options with the "innerHTML" as values/label
[14:26:38] <Cork> and set those elements as child to the select element
[14:26:48] <stack> NoiseEee: it is a common, "show thumbnail, upload via ajax the original"
[14:31:26] <unnu> Cork, i owe you a beer my friend
[14:32:24] <Cork> if i would drink all the beers ppl has offered me here i would most likely die...
[14:32:29] <Cork> but thx anyway :)
[14:32:31] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[14:33:37] <ciqsteve> Q: Data -  I know I can see if an element has data associated with it with .hasData()
[14:33:49] <ciqsteve> Q: how can I actually 'see' what the data is??
[14:33:58] <Cork> .data()
[14:34:18] <ciqsteve> cork  thanks
[14:34:24] <Cork> np
[14:34:25] <ciqsteve> can I see it in dev tools anywhere
[14:34:32] <ciqsteve> under scope vairables
[14:34:57] <Cork> some dev tools has built in support for jquery
[14:35:09] <ciqsteve> chrome
[14:35:10] <Cork> and some has extensions for it
[14:35:33] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you just call .data() on the element
[14:35:37] <Cork> but as the data jquery stores isn't directly assosiated with the dom elements
[14:35:41] <Cork> you can't just see it
[14:36:03] <ciqsteve> k thx again.. one more q if I may
[14:36:33] <ciqsteve> I like keeping data in the dom   data-my-data="xyz"  as it makes it easy to see 'whats-going-on' as I can just check out the state by looking at the dom
[14:37:04] <robertmaxrees> ciqsteve you mean as opposed to using .data()?
[14:37:09] <robertmaxrees> because .data() will be faster.
[14:37:14] <Cork> ciqsteve: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/samples#chrome-query
[14:37:17] <ciqsteve> however, I now got myself in a wierd state where   $(el).data(my-data) and $(el).attr(data-my-data)
[14:37:17] <ciqsteve> return two different values
[14:37:51] <Cork> ciqsteve: .data is a cache
[14:38:02] <Cork> it only parses the attribute if it doesn't have an entry in the cache
[14:38:09] <Cork> .data never sets attributes
[14:38:13] <ciqsteve> I believe the only way that can happen is if I set my-data directly  $(el).data(my-data) = "ABC"
[14:38:15] <robertmaxrees> ciqsteve the first returns a cached version and the second parses the html every time.  use the first.
[14:38:30] <ciqsteve> as compared to $(el).attr(data-my-data, "ABC")
[14:38:30] <robertmaxrees>  $(el).data('my-data)
[14:39:02] <robertmaxrees> you want $(el).data("my-data", "ABC") 90% of the time.
[14:39:21] <Cork> except if you want to select on the value of the attribute
[14:39:34] <robertmaxrees> which you normally don't want to do.
[14:39:35] <Cork> but then you are most of the time using an attribute when you should be using a class
[14:39:45] <ciqsteve> robertmaxress and cork  thx to you both
[14:40:16] <ciqsteve> what I want is a way to 'see' the data in the dom, as it makes my life much easier,
[14:40:33] <ciqsteve> but be able to set and get that data in a consistent manner, which I don't believe I can do (is that correct)?
[14:41:01] <Cork> ciqsteve: .data doesn't store the content in the dom
[14:41:03] <robertmaxrees> there are extensions for chrome and ff's dev tools that let you see that data.
[14:41:06] <Cork> cause dom can only hold strings
[14:41:11] <ciqsteve> the only way to 'see' the data in the dom is with attr("data-...", "ABC" )  is that correct?
[14:41:13] <robertmaxrees> but there's no way without using some sort of plugin.
[14:41:29] <Cork> ciqsteve: i linked you do the extension a few minutes ago
[14:41:47] <ciqsteve> cork I see it.. ty..   what's your workflow.. do you ever store dtaa in the dom itself?
[14:42:08] <Cork> ciqsteve: i avoid it as some browsers leak that data badly
[14:42:23] <ciqsteve>  by leak do you mean to users?
[14:42:27] <Cork> ciqsteve: and .data has much better support for, json, object, references and what not
[14:42:35] <Cork> ciqsteve: no as in memory leak
[14:42:36] <robertmaxrees> they mean memory leaks.
[14:42:42] <ciqsteve> ahh ok
[14:42:56] <robertmaxrees> .data() is basically the right interface for your purposes ;)
[14:43:02] <Cork> ya
[14:44:13] <ciqsteve> I kinda know it is.. but my dom is filled with containers (UI: cards) and the container dom stores basics of whats in it.. so if there are 50 of them I can, in a quick glance, find what I'm looking for or see problems  (like something not set)
[14:44:40] <ciqsteve> having all that one step away doesn't seem like a workflow improvement to me (though it looks like this chrome query will help)
[14:44:54] <ciqsteve> of course I know there are good reasons from minds wiser than mine
[14:45:06] <Cork> ciqsteve: .data normally contains A LOT of data
[14:45:15] <Cork> you don't want all that in the dom elements
[14:45:54] <ciqsteve> y  I run into the reasonableness limits of that now...
[14:46:15] <ciqsteve> so, to state the obvious.. I could just make an ajax call and return the data as json, then throw it into jquery
[14:46:40] <ciqsteve> would I have to attach it to an element, or can I store it without one?
[14:47:49] <Cork> ciqsteve: if you store the data unrelated to an element you can just store it in a global variable
[14:48:02] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:48:05] <Cork> ciqsteve: .data only makes sense if you need to store it in relation to an element
[14:48:37] <robertmaxrees> if that gets too unwieldly, store your data in a big object elsewhere and then use .data() to store a key to that object's data in that object.
[14:49:12] <ciqsteve> ahh right.. got it
[14:50:00] <robertmaxrees> cases like this are why you get into using things like backbone/angular/react/riot/whatever else.
[14:54:23] <ciqsteve> thanks for chrome query link.. is that from google or 'web volcano'  (not sure how to install the extension from link you provided so I searched for it in web store)
[15:03:45] <ciqsteve> robertmaxrees and cork   tyvm to you both.. cheers
[15:04:01] <robertmaxrees> word
[15:28:54] <P0rk> What's the best way to select the first td element in each tr? $("tr td").first() only selects the first in the list. I want all the firsts.
[15:29:50] <P0rk> $("tr").filter(function (e) {return $(this).find("td").first();})   ugggly
[15:30:03] <robertmaxrees> about your only choice though.
[15:30:21] <P0rk> Okay, I can deal with ugly. Thanks.
[15:33:44] <P0rk> oops. Doesn't work. Any suggestions?
[15:33:45] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/ydwg11zk/8/
[15:34:12] <P0rk> so filter doesn't return a value other than true of false? should I use map?
[15:34:40] <P0rk> got it. THanks
[15:35:10] <robertmaxrees> err, filter would be against $('tr td') - you'd have to check the element's index in the function, but you get the idea.
[15:36:57] <decx> $('tr td:nth-child(1)').text(function(i){ return i+'.' })
[15:37:34] <P0rk> ugggg It's nth-child(1)   I thought it was nth-child[1] and I gave up   Thanks
[15:45:20] <Respek> thinking of building a little easter-egg into a client's site where on click coins fall from the top of the window like a jackpot was hit. Any thoughts / examples anyone has seen?
[15:46:12] <robertmaxrees> raptor.js has done stuff.
[15:46:25] <robertmaxrees> but beware easter eggs.  some folks don't find them entertaining :(
[15:46:50] <__joshua__> yeah, you need to hide them well
[15:46:53] <Respek> hm :/
[15:47:29] <__joshua__> the client may ask why they were charged for something they didn't ask for
[15:47:37] <__joshua__> so you ahve to hide it from them
[15:49:10] <Respek> I think it
[15:49:18] <Respek> 'd be appropriate in this case
[15:49:37] <__joshua__> so you want an example of animating this?
[15:49:44] <Respek> but that's great advice, and I'll definitely judge the difficulty against your advice.
[15:53:50] <tab1293> is there any plugin that allows multiple images to dynamically be assembled into a sing image?
[15:53:55] <tab1293> *single
[15:54:29] <Respek> __joshua__:  If you're aware of one, yes please. the closest I've found is snowflakes, but I know how cognitive resources can be :)
[17:22:48] <Trow1> anyone is here ?
[17:23:04] <robertmaxrees> over 670 of us :)
[17:26:16] <Trow> http://jsfiddle.net/j8wk2poj/4/
[17:27:10] <Trow> i want to display in order the text in span
[17:27:17] <Trow> using the each
[17:27:22] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:27:27] <Trow> hrm ?
[17:27:50] <robertmaxrees> " i want to display in order the text in span" <- you mean you want to display each span in order?
[17:28:06] <robertmaxrees> from top to bottom?
[17:28:31] <Trow> no no
[17:29:11] <Trow> well it concatinate the result of the same nodes in same level in one variable
[17:29:22] <Trow> actually the each is not working
[17:29:43] <robertmaxrees> you want to be able to do something like animals/cat/images/cat001.jpg ?
[17:31:14] <Trow> no one sec
[17:33:21] <Trow> http://jsfiddle.net/j8wk2poj/5/
[17:33:24] <Trow> robertmaxrees,
[17:33:30] <Trow> i removed the each
[17:33:40] <Trow> now im getting cat001.jpgcat002.jpg
[17:33:54] <Trow> but im getting it in one result
[17:34:05] <Trow> in one *variable
[17:34:17] <robertmaxrees> you're not really explaining what you're looking for >.>
[17:34:36] <robertmaxrees> you want to create one variable for each span?
[17:34:43] <Trow> yes
[17:35:07] <robertmaxrees> you can't dynamically create variables.  you can dynamically create property names.
[17:35:36] <robertmaxrees> can you share what you want the data structure to eventually look like?
[17:36:07] <Trow> i want to loop in each span that s what i want to do
[17:36:22] <robertmaxrees> that question doesn't make any sense.
[17:36:25] <Trow> i want in the console i get cat001.jpg
[17:36:32] <Trow> and then in other line
[17:36:33] <Trow> cat002.jpg
[17:37:07] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/j8wk2poj/6/
[17:37:09] <robertmaxrees> bam done.
[17:37:52] <Trow> nooo i m building a tree --'
[17:38:12] <robertmaxrees> give me a representation if what you want it to look like when all is said and done.
[17:39:13] <Trow> http://jsfiddle.net/j8wk2poj/3/
[17:39:32] <Trow> the object is in the bottom
[17:39:37] <robertmaxrees> okay, so you want to create that JSON from that markup.
[17:39:43] <Trow> yes
[17:39:53] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you might be confused about how recursion works.
[17:40:35] <Trow> why ??
[17:41:58] <robertmaxrees> oh I see what you're trying to do in your original example.
[17:42:03] <robertmaxrees> that's a really weird way imo.
[17:42:04] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[17:51:32] <Trow> robertmaxrees, still here ?
[17:51:35] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:51:38] <robertmaxrees> sorry, at work.
[17:51:47] <robertmaxrees> this doesn't do the nesting you want, but http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/j8wk2poj/8/
[17:51:54] <robertmaxrees> keep it simpler.
[17:52:13] <robertmaxrees> instead of your we're element removals and stuff.
[17:52:33] <robertmaxrees> also my next question is - why can't you generate the correct data server-side?
[17:53:27] <Trow> why is it simpler ?
[17:54:06] <robertmaxrees> you want to collect data first.  instead, you're modifying collections and using the returned data from said removals to collect data.
[17:54:31] <Trow> and ?
[17:54:33] <robertmaxrees> plus it's easier to reason about your code and understand what it's doing.
[17:54:54] <robertmaxrees> explicit vs implicit.
[17:55:26] <Trow> sorry but i ddnt unerstand you
[17:55:40] <Trow> anyway is not the solution im searching
[17:55:41] <robertmaxrees> how much experience do you have with javascript and jquery, if you don't mind my asking?
[17:55:44] <Trow> thnak you
[17:55:47] <Trow> thank you
[17:56:05] <Trow> 1 year and a half
[17:56:13] <robertmaxrees> i told you the example was incomplete.
[17:56:16] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[17:56:17] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[18:00:32] <Trow> if you can finish having the main json object it it will be nice
[18:07:54] <Trow> it is possible http://jsfiddle.net/j8wk2poj/9/ robertmaxrees
[18:15:58] <robertmaxrees> it's possible to give you what you want, sure, i just don't have time to do it for you.
[18:16:09] <robertmaxrees> you have to check what level you're at and if that level has any children, etc.
[18:16:28] <robertmaxrees> and stuff like var $li = $ul.remove().children("li").remove(); is really hacky imo.
[18:17:20] <Trow> u r right
[18:17:37] <Trow> changing somthg in complexity ?
[18:39:55] <jeffreylevesque> does the 'on' method bind events to existing events (if they exists)?

[19:10:12] <crazythings> Shoky, do I need to add more css?
[19:10:25] <shoky> crazythings i dunno, it's your box
[19:11:01] <crazythings> shoky, lol, I know, ha, sorry!
[19:13:20] <crazythings> Hm, cannot get box to show for some reason
[20:07:15] <Prometheian> I'm having some trouble getting my modal to show remote content. Would anyone mind taking a peek at my code? Starting on line 43.
[20:07:18] <Prometheian> https://github.com/krishnaglick/PokemonMastersGuildSite/blob/master/PokemonMastersGuildSite/Views/GuildRoster/Index.cshtml
[20:07:23] <Prometheian> And the javascript is below, line 23.
[20:07:30] <Prometheian> https://github.com/krishnaglick/PokemonMastersGuildSite/blob/master/PokemonMastersGuildSite/Scripts/GuildRoster.js
[20:45:56] <__joshua__> Prometheian: are you triggering a 'hidden' event?
[20:46:19] <Prometheian> Do I have something capturing a hide event?
[20:47:12] <__joshua__> oh i see, your loadPlayer function isn't executing?
[20:47:47] <Prometheian> loadPlayer runs fine
[20:48:01] <Prometheian> It's when I click a player that I'm having trouble
[20:48:25] <Prometheian> The modal pops up, but nothing is filled in.
[20:48:29] <Prometheian> I can link the page it hits.
[20:57:29] <Prometheian> __joshua__?
[21:00:17] <__joshua__> sorry, distracted.  what plugin are you using?
[21:00:45] <Prometheian> bootstrap?
[21:01:21] <Prometheian> I'm using the modal from bootstrap, unsure of what else you might mean.
[21:02:17] <__joshua__> right
[21:02:29] <__joshua__> and $('.modal-body') is the right seletor?
[21:03:07] <__joshua__> looks right for bootstrap 3
[21:04:21] <__joshua__> this.Name scoping looks off
[21:20:39] <Prometheian> this.Name?
[21:22:30] <doug_> Prometheian: what's the question?
[21:23:33] <Prometheian> Why bootstrap isn't loading the page into the modal-body, or why the $.load is putting things in there but they're not showing up
[21:24:33] <doug_> Prometheian: my guess: it uses those elements to make the dialog and you aren't changing the "real" (displayed) dialog's elements
[21:24:44] <Alski> Quick question, is there a way I can use .filter() to remove only an A tag with a certain data-id?
[21:25:06] <doug_> Prometheian: do you have a jsfiddle or something to show it?
[21:25:10] <Prometheian> Well even using bootstraps method it doesn't seem to work. Maybe I need to specifiy the modal-body in the target page
[21:25:17] <Prometheian> Nope, just that source code
[21:26:21] <doug_> Prometheian: what source code. I have only been connected for half an hour
[21:26:27] <Prometheian> ah, sec
[21:26:30] <Prometheian> https://github.com/krishnaglick/PokemonMastersGuildSite/blob/master/PokemonMastersGuildSite/Scripts/GuildRoster.js
[21:26:34] <Prometheian> https://github.com/krishnaglick/PokemonMastersGuildSite/blob/master/PokemonMastersGuildSite/Views/GuildRoster/Index.cshtml
[21:33:11] <Alski> So I have an AJAX call to delete a tag. When it returns successful, how can I filter to delete that particular "Tag" div? Some pseudo jquery:  $('.deleteSkill').filter(has an a tag containing $(this).data("id") ).remove();
[21:33:43] <doug_> Prometheian: going to attempt to recreate
[21:33:51] <Prometheian> roger
[21:38:24] <doug_> Prometheian: works for me http://jsfiddle.net/q6txkw4z/
[21:39:27] <Prometheian> I'm not loading some content to load a url, I'm loading the content from the url directly into the body.
[21:39:42] <doug_> so am I
[21:40:06] <doug_> it loads http://fiddle.jshell.net/9Lt0tq2n/show/ content into the modal
[21:41:02] <Prometheian> Using .load I can get it to 'load' in, but it doesn't show.
[21:41:30] <doug_> Prometheian: do the elements change in the debugger?
[21:42:19] <doug_> Prometheian: you may need to add a link tag to your page head to get css too
[21:42:46] <Prometheian> Elements do change in debugger.
[21:43:00] <Prometheian> https://github.com/krishnaglick/PokemonMastersGuildSite/blob/master/PokemonMastersGuildSite/Static/PlayerDetails.html
[21:43:04] <doug_> Prometheian: so is it a style problem hiding the elements?
[21:43:16] <Prometheian> https://github.com/krishnaglick/PokemonMastersGuildSite/blob/master/PokemonMastersGuildSite/Scripts/PlayerDetails.js
[21:43:20] <Prometheian> I don't believe so
[21:43:33] <Prometheian> No styles are being applied that would do that
[21:44:07] <doug_> Prometheian: manually add  <link href="../CSS/guildroster.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />   to the page that does the .load
[21:44:09] <doug_> as a test
[21:44:58] <doug_> or wait... is that paste the page that does the .load ?
[21:45:24] <doug_> that's what gets loaded right?
[21:45:32] <doug_> .load'ed
[21:46:00] <Prometheian> ?
[21:46:12] <Prometheian> The content on the PlayerDetails.html page is what gets loaded
[21:46:26] <doug_> are there any <link .. stylesheet> tags on the page that you .load ?
[21:46:31] <Prometheian> But it does not display.
[21:47:47] <Prometheian> There seems to be some issue w/ the target page actually loading before being rendered.
[21:48:29] <kinesis> im sort've new to jquery, can anyone explain why this isn't executing? http://pastie.org/private/q9lrzkk9jtscr3qbme8ugw

[21:49:56] <kinesis> yet i have error_log("test 123") at line #2 of that PHP script
[21:50:01] <kinesis> and it doesn't show anything in my error.log
[21:51:13] <doug_> kinesis: check the Network pane of the debugger in the browser
[21:51:18] <doug_> does it do the POST request?
[21:51:29] <kinesis> I checked the console. Let me check again.
[21:53:19] <kinesis> Ctrl Shift I in chrome right... I had checked the console already but nothing is in Network either
[21:53:35] <doug_> kinesis: sec...
[21:54:26] <kinesis> I checked the jQuery manual for post too. I'm sort've new to it, but it looked ok.
[21:57:27] <doug_> kinesis: http://jsfiddle.net/woLysgdw/1/
[21:57:46] <doug_> kinesis: in browser debugger click network tab
[21:57:51] <doug_> see the request for SOMETHING
[21:57:52] <doug_> ?
[21:58:26] <doug_> kinesis: check for that on your real page
[21:58:52] <doug_> kinesis: re-run the fiddle with network tab visible

[21:59:56] <doug_> kinesis: too many )
[22:00:22] <kinesis> ok cool fixed
[22:00:43] <doug_> it's supposed to fail though...
[22:00:50] <doug_> just an example of seeing it in network pane
[22:01:01] <doug_> you see the SOMETHING POST request in network pane right?

[22:01:47] <doug_> Uhkis: thanks
[22:03:19] <kinesis> Ha, i forgot the </script> tag
[22:09:11] <kinesis> Yeah I can't get it to work
[22:09:47] <kinesis> It says Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[22:11:47] <kinesis> I can't get this to work -> http://pastie.org/private/zrq3kiss2ui0tonkyb04na
[22:14:54] <Uhkis> kinesis: did you include jquery before your script?
[22:16:22] <kinesis> I better have. That would be stupid..
[22:18:12] <kinesis> yeah it works now.
[22:23:04] <kinesis> it wont post
[22:25:01] <kinesis> My jquery is failing to post()
[22:26:04] <tw2113> have you determined which side is actually failing?
[22:26:13] <tw2113> are you making sure you're receiving data on the php side?
[22:26:25] <kinesis> http://pastie.org/private/yj16an6nbrh2qt30rzuua
[22:26:32] <kinesis> In Google Chrome console I see error 500
[22:26:38] <tw2113> i realize you have your jquery snippet
[22:26:41] <tw2113> that's not the PHP side
[22:26:46] <kinesis> my error_log() doesnt execute
[22:26:55] <tw2113> what error log?
[22:26:55] <kinesis> I put error_log("test 123") at line #3 of my PHP
[22:27:09] <kinesis> it is suppose to write "test123" to /var/log/apache2/error.log if the PHP is executed
[22:27:30] <tw2113> i'm more of a die() person or if i'm in an IDE, a breakpoint
[22:27:49] <kinesis> Plus a dialog should pop up saying "done"
[22:27:52] <tw2113> are you sure your js is finding the php path correctly?
[22:28:00] <kinesis> let me see
[22:28:24] <kinesis> yea it is there
[22:28:43] <tw2113> the file may be there on the server
[22:28:59] <tw2113> but the jquery.post() may not be finding it, is what i'm saying
[22:30:04] <kinesis> ok ill see
[22:30:17] <kinesis> I'll put the full URL
[22:30:20] <Uhkis> shouldn't that just create a regular 404
[22:31:15] <kinesis> 500 Internal Server Error
[22:31:48] <kinesis> Hey I got it
[23:00:24] <Kartagis> $("#mainmenu ul li:has(ul)").find("span:first").addClass("down"); <--- does this mean "in the element with id mainmenu ul li and that has class ul, find the first span and add the class down"
[23:00:28] <Kartagis> ?
[23:00:59] <Kartagis> if so, what's the point of adding a class? why not just hardcode it?
[23:04:42] <Alski> I'm trying to figure something out, how can I use the data-id attribute on an A tag to remove it's parent div?
[23:07:28] <Alski> As if it was something like $('.removeTag').filter(this.data-id).remove(); inside of an ajax function?
[23:11:27] <Cork> Alexer: $('.removeTag').map(function() { return $this).data('id'); }).remove();
[23:11:34] <Cork> hmm
[23:11:35] <Cork> nope
[23:11:50] <Cork> Alexer: $('.removeTag').map(function() { return $('#' + $this).data('id'))[0]; }).remove();
[23:13:01] <Alski> Ahh, I'll give it a try!
[23:13:16] <Uhkis> Kartagis: tag ul, sounds like a submenu implementation
[23:14:06] <Kartagis> Uhkis: but what's the point of adding a class with jquery when you can hardcode?
[23:14:21] <Kartagis> I'm sure there is a use
[23:14:28] <Kartagis> but still...
[23:15:17] <Uhkis> so your question is "why dynamic when you can go static"
[23:18:39] <Cork> Kartagis: the reason is cause :has is a jquery extension
[23:18:51] <Cork> Kartagis: you can't have it in a normal css selector
[23:19:08] <Cork> so in order to define the properties for the rule you need to use a class and then "fake" it with js
[23:19:22] <Kartagis> Cork: what about $(".down") instead?
[23:19:38] <Cork> Kartagis: that would be the other direction
[23:19:48] <Cork> after that other line has been ran
[23:27:50] <snufft> hi guys
[23:28:55] <snufft> i'm looking for an event of when an element is created. Does this exist? I've found some code like $('document').on('DOMNodeInserted'  but it seems to have mixed results. Also, is there an opposite version of this for when an element is destroyed?
[23:31:01] <snufft> that's probably the crappiest description ever. "i'm looking for an event which is fired when an element is created" might make a bit more sense :)
[23:46:59] <Cork> snufft: there was for a little while support for dom modification events, but it has been deprecated
[23:47:36] <Cork> snufft: a new dom mutation observer has been replacing it
[23:47:44] <Cork> snufft: but none of these are cross browser
[23:48:06] <Cork> snufft: your best option is to use a callback from the code that adds the element, and use that instead
[23:50:59] <snufft> Cork, thank you very much :) I'll have to stop being lazy then and write one, haha!
