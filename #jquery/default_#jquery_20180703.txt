[04:09:09] <DreamStiffy> hi guys
[04:09:20] <neo4> DreamStiffy: Hello! How are you? ;)
[04:09:21] <DreamStiffy> cork around?
[04:09:42] <neo4> DreamStiffy: I am instead of him
[04:09:49] <DreamStiffy> hi neo4 , im not sure what am i doing wrong at the new fiddle its asking me for a title? https://jsfiddle.net/bhfpgrwm/2/
[04:10:05] <DreamStiffy> {"error":"key missing: title"}
[04:11:00] <neo4> DreamStiffy: don't see, where. I have 404 after sending the form
[04:11:06] <DreamStiffy> my real question is how do i get $(this).find('input[name=firstname1]').val();
[04:11:35] <DreamStiffy> since theres two forms
[04:11:45] <DreamStiffy> i want to use the same function for both forms
[04:12:13] <neo4> DreamStiffy: add different class to form and use $(this).find('class1 input[name=firstname1]').val();
[04:12:20] <DreamStiffy> but i tried to find the child of $this but couldnt get the value
[04:12:38] <DreamStiffy> can you put it in the fiddle
[04:12:40] <neo4> add class1 to first form and class 2 to second and use
[04:12:40] <neo4> class1 input[name=firstname1] selector
[04:12:45] <neo4> DreamStiffy: now
[04:13:11] <DreamStiffy> neo4: ?
[04:14:28] <DreamStiffy> neo4: if i use diff class then i cant be using the same funct for all forms can i
[04:14:46] <neo4> DreamStiffy: something like this, missing title https://jsfiddle.net/bhfpgrwm/4/
[04:14:59] <neo4> DreamStiffy: yes, you can
[04:15:09] <neo4> get any data from dom and put to form
[04:15:27] <neo4> doesnt' matter whether this data is in form or somewhere else
[04:16:27] <neo4> DreamStiffy: $('selector_submig).click(function(){}); I use this function for submit form
[04:17:26] <DreamStiffy> neo4: u mean u use the button to submit instead of the form?
[04:17:46] <neo4> DreamStiffy: I don't know that syntax like you used )
[04:21:06] <DreamStiffy> hmm think u missing my point
[04:21:37] <neo4> DreamStiffy: see, this works https://jsfiddle.net/bhfpgrwm/10/
[04:22:51] <DreamStiffy> neo4: sorry i just realize i made a mistake in earlier script
[04:22:56] <DreamStiffy> let me fix that
[04:23:24] <neo4> DreamStiffy: you can use my script, but that doesn't matter, you have to know how to reach each element on DOM
[04:23:32] <neo4> css selectors
[04:24:44] <neo4> DreamStiffy: this 'someclass li', find(), closes(), parent() are useful functions for navigating
[04:24:53] <DreamStiffy> neo4: https://jsfiddle.net/bhfpgrwm/13/
[04:25:02] <AdamPDotty> would be a nice start just to unmess the code
[04:25:05] <DreamStiffy> neo4: this i what i wanted
[04:25:19] <DreamStiffy> neo4: 2 buttons for submission
[04:25:49] <DreamStiffy> neo4: but both buttons would use the same function. hence i tried using the (this) and find
[04:26:02] <Cork> DreamStiffy: i would recommend to move the event handling out of the html
[04:26:24] <Cork> and that would most likely make it easier to do what you want
[04:26:38] <neo4> DreamStiffy: use different function, it doesn't matter, it's up to you... if you want you can use one functions
[04:26:39] <Cork> (currently the alert will block the return false so the submit happens)
[04:27:13] <DreamStiffy> Cork: Hi masteguru ji
[04:28:21] <Cork> DreamStiffy: https://jsfiddle.net/bhfpgrwm/15/
[04:29:13] <DreamStiffy> Cork: im not sure which u refer the code from but i need two submit buttons
[04:29:38] <DreamStiffy> Cork: refer here : https://jsfiddle.net/bhfpgrwm/13/
[04:29:54] <DreamStiffy> my earlier code was not what i really wanted
[04:30:12] <DreamStiffy> i missed the first button
[04:30:12] <Cork> you only have one button per form
[04:30:21] <Cork> so it would work just fine
[04:30:26] <DreamStiffy> Cork: yes sir
[04:30:42] <Cork> so /15 would handle that just fine
[04:31:26] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/bhfpgrwm/17/ just removed the id on the button
[04:32:36] <DreamStiffy> im getting undefined
[04:32:49] <DreamStiffy> oh ok
[04:32:50] <DreamStiffy> hold on
[04:33:24] <Cork> ya, that is cause MainGuest is not in the page
[04:34:22] <Cork> DreamStiffy: https://jsfiddle.net/bhfpgrwm/26/
[04:34:24] <DreamStiffy> ya just inserted
[04:34:31] <DreamStiffy> https://jsfiddle.net/bhfpgrwm/25/
[04:34:46] <Cork> (also don't use alert for debugging)
[04:35:24] <DreamStiffy> Cork: ok so what did i do wrong?
[04:35:44] <Cork> first you did alert(""); return false; in the submit
[04:35:55] <Cork> as alert stops the js execution the return never happened
[04:36:02] <Cork> so you got the submit
[04:36:20] <Cork> replacing return false with event.preventDefault() fixed that
[04:36:57] <Cork> and to do event.preventDefault() i moved away from dom0 event attributes to event listeners instead
[04:37:54] <DreamStiffy> i need to read up on the difference
[04:37:57] <Cork> and in /25 i replaced alert() with console.log(), it would also have fixed the first problem, though both are changes you should do
[04:38:05] <DreamStiffy> yea i noticed that
[04:38:34] <Cork> DreamStiffy: event attributes are when you put a string in the html start tag that should be evaled as javascript
[04:38:56] <Cork> event listeners are a separate snippet of javascript that finds the dom element and attaches a listener
[04:39:11] <Cork> the later can happen multiple times per elements and have a defined call order
[04:39:31] <Cork> the first is a property on the dom element and can ever only be one (and has a bunch of other legacy werdities)
[04:39:45] <Cork> for the record dom0 predates events :)
[04:40:13] <Cork> its back in the lovely era when page modifications was done with document.write
[04:40:44] <Cork> and event attributes should be left in the same bin that document.write is
[04:43:28] <DreamStiffy> Cork: thats some history. where can i read these
[04:44:48] <Cork> not sure if it is collected anywhere
[04:49:46] <DreamStiffy> Cork: thank you master ji
[04:49:54] <DreamStiffy> again for your help
[04:49:59] <DreamStiffy> i shall continue my journey
[04:50:25] <DreamStiffy> and neo4 thank you too
[05:46:54] <snake-venom> in my console i can see " =&departureDate=&currency=USD "  but when printing this in browser its showing like " =&departureDate=¤cy=USD "
[05:52:32] <Cork> ¤ ??
[05:52:42] <Cork> that is quite unlikely...
[05:53:35] <fn> hello, https://pastebin.com/RG3se2yF how do bind it again?
[05:53:35] <WALL-E> fn: In order to help you better, please demonstrate your issue with a minimal amount of code here: http://jsfiddle.net/boilerplate/jquery - replace the HTML/CSS/JavaScript with your test case, click "Fork" at the left top and share the URL here.
[05:54:13] <Cork> WALL-E: don't use event attributes use event listeners
[05:58:29] <fn> @Cork: I know, but I cant change the html structure, only the *.js files (dont ask...)
[06:56:14] <snake-venom> Cork, sorry i was away ...
[06:56:23] <snake-venom> again i am asking my question
[06:56:24] <snake-venom> in my console i can see " =&departureDate=&currency=USD "  but when printing this in browser its showing like " =&departureDate=¤cy=USD "
[06:57:21] <snake-venom> i am gathering all the input value and name in object and then var qrtStr = decodeURIComponent($.param(obj, true))
[07:05:27] <snake-venom> solved .html() was giving me issue.. then i did text()
[07:05:29] <snake-venom> and its working
[08:19:48] <hollusion>  how to i set javascript default events for modal?
[08:23:01] <Cork> eh, what?
[08:23:45] <Cork> are you talking about some jquery plugin or something?
[08:23:56] <hollusion> sorry i forgot to add
[08:24:02] <hollusion> "for a bootstrap modal"
[08:24:23] <Cork> => ##bootstrap
[08:24:33] <hollusion> channel is dead :)
[08:30:13] <hollusion> seems like bootstrap does not have such a functionality
[10:49:48] <Dirkos> Im trying to do a XHR request but it seems it keeps giving me back the cookies (since they are also in the request ofc). Since i want to cache the response by Nginx RP there is no way to handle this
[10:49:57] <Dirkos> Anyone that knows away in .ajax to stop sending the cookies?
[10:50:50] <Cork> Dirkos: the cookie is handled by the browser
[10:50:50] <MikeD_> i have a url to a pdf that i want to store in a database ... is there anything tricky about the $.get( myurl ).then( dostuff )
[10:51:07] <Dirkos> Cork: yeah i was afraid of that and the cookie is default set during login ofc
[10:51:07] <Cork> so it is a bit complicated as it is below the ui for javascript
[10:51:24] <Dirkos> Before i used a custom repsonse header to unset the cookie just before caching
[10:51:34] <Dirkos> But thats not really easy anymore with nginx proxy (before i was using varnish)
[10:51:52] <Cork> MikeD_: you want to use .done unless you want to modify the data for other deferred objects
[10:52:04] <Cork> as .then replaces the object after it is called
[10:52:39] <Cork> Dirkos: you could have a subdomain and have it no-cookied
[10:52:52] <Cork> but then you will have to deal with cors and all that fun
[10:52:56] <MikeD_> ok, do i have to set the dataType to application/pdf or is that different?
[10:53:13] <Cork> MikeD_: uh
[10:53:26] <Cork> you want to send a file to the server?
[10:54:09] <MikeD_> yeah, i thought $.get( foo ) was pretty straightforward but i have a coworker who insists "you have to tell it what type you are requesting"
[10:54:22] <Cork> you can't upload files with get calls
[10:54:25] <MikeD_> no, i want to get a pdf and store it in database
[10:54:33] <Cork> ah
[10:54:45] <Cork> well it becomes a bit more complicated if you want to download files with ajax
[10:54:53] <Cork> you need to download it as a blob
[10:55:01] <Cork> or as a bytearray
[10:57:50] <Cork> MikeD_: and jquery doesn't have native support for those response types
[11:01:06] <MikeD_> cool
[11:01:27] <MikeD_> any suggestion on an easy way to visualize a bytearray?
[11:02:02] <Cork> not really
[11:02:20] <Cork> best is prob to keep it as a blob and then just storing that
[11:03:21] <Cork> but the problem will constantly be to convert the raw binary data to a format you can store as a string
[11:03:30] <Dirkos> Cork: makes since, will review thanks
[11:03:35] <Cork> you will have to do something like base64 encode it
[11:05:17] <MikeD_> yeah, i'm thinking the best solution here to to force the content to be stored as not-a-pdf and sidestep the pdf completely
[11:05:51] <MikeD_> pdf is Fail in almost every way
[11:06:23] <Cork> except for the "extreamly porable way" :)
[11:08:07] <MikeD_> i'm biased i think everything should be html
[11:22:07] <hollusion> $.ajaxSettings.xhr().upload.addEventListener('progress', uploadProgress, false);
[11:22:26] <hollusion> works well to handle the progress but i cant fine the event that fires once the upload is complete
[11:22:39] <hollusion> .addEventListener('load',...) does not seem to be it
[11:50:38] <MikeD_> loadend
[12:30:31] <serdar> hello
[12:34:13] <serdar> I am trying to create a autocomplete list, I tried this: https://pastebin.com/1V93r38S but it never reaches line 25
[12:34:13] <WALL-E> serdar: In order to help you better, please demonstrate your issue with a minimal amount of code here: http://jsfiddle.net/boilerplate/jquery - replace the HTML/CSS/JavaScript with your test case, click "Fork" at the left top and share the URL here.
[14:43:12] <serdar> I have this result in my success function of my Ajax call: result = "{"33699":"Bielefeld","33689":"Bielefeld","33619":"Bielefeld"......"}" but if I say response(JSON.parse(result)) the value and label of the item I see are both "Bielefeld"
[14:43:23] <serdar> For some reason the zip Code is wiped
[14:50:23] <serdar> It looks like, that response(JSON.parse) is doing this
[15:30:17] <robertmaxrees> serdar errr
[15:30:51] <robertmaxrees> serdar you mean something like https://jsfiddle.net/8n9zb1o3/ ?
[15:33:33] <robertmaxrees> serdar https://jsfiddle.net/8n9zb1o3/4/
[15:36:40] <serdar> Hmm, maybe that was an option, I build a new json object while creating new entries. https://jsfiddle.net/1f80wLta/
[15:37:25] <robertmaxrees> so what does "33699 ":"Bielefeld " represent?
[15:37:28] <robertmaxrees> zip and city?\
[15:37:32] <serdar> yes
[15:37:39] <robertmaxrees> ah, that's a bad format for that data then.
[15:37:51] <robertmaxrees> should be key/value instyead.
[15:37:58] <serdar> Not mine, but yes. I am using it :)
[15:38:02] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:38:37] <serdar> it was a hash map in java
[15:38:51] <serdar> That's the result I get from gson
[15:39:04] <robertmaxrees> still a bad representation of the datta.
[15:39:07] <robertmaxrees> *data
[17:23:01] <Al_nz1> Maybe slightly OT, but can someone explained, with checkbox, does checked determine if the box is checked or not,  name determines the name of the value returned by the form, and value true would return true if checked? so checked=checked name="red" value="true" on submission would return red:true ?
[17:27:35] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 name is the name property of that input
[17:28:12] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to understand what gets submitted, Al_nz1?
[17:28:25] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yes
[17:28:41] <robertmaxrees> you could easily setup a test case to figure that out :)
[17:29:09] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: I have. It sent the form data with the attribute of the id, not the name
[17:29:17] <Al_nz1> value did determine the name
[17:29:20] <robertmaxrees> show your markup?
[17:29:26] <Al_nz1> i mean value dteremined the true etc
[17:29:39] <Al_nz1> <input class="form-check-input checkbox1" type="checkbox" id="section1Checkbox1" name="s1c1" value="true" th:field="*{needsAssessment.section1Checkbox1}">
[17:29:53] <Al_nz1> there is some thymeleaf templating in there, but thats not an issue
[17:30:01] <robertmaxrees> and this was just a straiught form submission or...?
[17:30:09] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yes
[17:30:27] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:31:01] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox
[17:31:05] <robertmaxrees> this should answer your questiohns.
[17:31:07] <robertmaxrees> *questions
[17:32:48] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: already read that. It doesnt answer the questions
[17:33:14] <Al_nz1> it makes no mention for example of checked="checked"
[17:33:17] <Al_nz1> https://imgur.com/a/Q3tt0mU
[17:33:36] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/putvN2D.png
[17:33:43] <robertmaxrees> because it's a boolean attribute.
[17:33:43] <Al_nz1> that picture shows what I got back, but I expected name to determine the name of the form data coming back
[17:33:53] <robertmaxrees> it's just checked, not checked="checked"
[17:36:13] <Al_nz1> So I still dont get why id is determing the form data sent back? I thought name determined it?
[17:36:21] <robertmaxrees> so question one -  "does checked = checked"
[17:36:24] <robertmaxrees> answered.
[17:36:35] <Al_nz1> ie name="red" value="true" returns red:true
[17:36:47] <robertmaxrees> in a form, right?
[17:37:02] <Al_nz1> but it appears id="red" value="true" returns red:true
[17:38:00] <Al_nz1> yes in a form
[17:41:56] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0645mvo2/
[17:42:00] <robertmaxrees> give this a read.
[17:42:04] <robertmaxrees> *look
[17:42:57] <robertmaxrees> so value can be whatever you want - you can also fully omit it.
[17:44:11] <robertmaxrees> make sense Al_nz1
[17:45:42] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: experimenting with it now. Clearly my form is not working the same way as yours
[17:45:47] <Al_nz1> perhaps a bootstrap thing
[17:45:56] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[17:46:20] <robertmaxrees> the first of the two inputs appears to be matching the behavior you're describing.
[17:46:33] <Al_nz1> well look at that screen shot, I also have values coming back twice, the second time prefixed with underscore
[17:47:14] <robertmaxrees> try using serializeArray() and compare against that instead.
[17:47:26] <Al_nz1> I am inspecting in browser
[17:47:43] <Al_nz1> in dev mode
[17:47:57] <robertmaxrees> and not using the serializeArray() i'm using in my example?
[17:48:16] <Al_nz1> well in your fiddle I am inspecting in console in dev mode
[17:48:21] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:48:25] <robertmaxrees> compare apples to apples yo
[17:49:20] <robertmaxrees> compare them using the same tool.  that should reveal much more.
[17:52:17] <Al_nz1> ok
