[01:24:58] <MrCrackPotBuilde> hi im having a weird issue
[01:25:21] <MrCrackPotBuilde> ive got a filter/sorting function on my page thats sorts images based on the catagory clicked
[01:26:04] <MrCrackPotBuilde> when i load the page all the images are great image hover with text is great but i click on a button and sort for a catagory say green the images no longer have the image hover
[01:26:42] <MrCrackPotBuilde> but the only class i remove is .scale-anm
[01:26:56] <Cork> MrCrackPotBuilde: how are you sorting the images?
[01:27:13] <MrCrackPotBuilde> yep
[01:27:15] <MrCrackPotBuilde> 1 sec
[01:27:25] <Cork> (make a jsfiddle)
[01:27:27] <MrCrackPotBuilde> it goes
[01:28:09] <MrCrackPotBuilde> i dont know how to make one of those
[01:28:15] <MrCrackPotBuilde> it took me ages to get this to work
[01:28:35] <Cork> just add an example of the image html structure and the js code you run to sort it
[01:29:34] <MrCrackPotBuilde> https://pastebin.com/0SKeU9ZC
[01:30:10] <Cork> humf... i asked for a jsfiddle...
[01:30:15] <MrCrackPotBuilde> https://pastebin.com/EuJ5ukAk
[01:30:27] <MrCrackPotBuilde> its all inside there
[01:30:30] <MrCrackPotBuilde> thats all i use
[01:30:41] <MrCrackPotBuilde> im developing with ruby on rails
[01:30:51] <Cork> need to reboot a bit, please build a jsfiddle.net while i do tha
[01:30:53] <Cork> +t
[01:31:08] <MrCrackPotBuilde> i dont know how to build a jsfiddle ill google it thought
[01:31:14] <Woet> if you dont know how to make a jsfiddle then you haven't debugged your issue well enough yet
[01:31:18] <Woet> just paste your test case in jsfiddle
[01:31:29] <Woet> the minimal amount of JS/HTML/CSS needed to demonstrate your issue
[01:31:31] <MrCrackPotBuilde> you cant debug what you dontknow
[01:31:38] <Woet> then you should know it first
[01:31:56] <MrCrackPotBuilde> thats why im googling now
[01:32:24] <Cork> MrCrackPotBuilde: you don't need to google it, just add the content to the page
[01:32:27] <Cork> and hit save...
[01:32:49] <MrCrackPotBuilde> its ok now i know what a jsfiddle is ill do it now
[01:39:06] <MrCrackPotBuilde> https://jsfiddle.net/5qxkzypk/
[01:39:19] <MrCrackPotBuilde> i cant get it to reproduce the error though
[01:40:36] <Cork> cleaned up https://jsfiddle.net/5qxkzypk/1/
[01:40:42] <Cork> could you add the hover code too?
[01:43:12] <Cork> with the ruby code replaced https://jsfiddle.net/5qxkzypk/2/
[01:45:52] <Cork> MrCrackPotBuilde: you set display: none on all the overlay divs
[01:45:58] <Cork> that is why things don't work after a sort
[01:46:31] <Cork> MrCrackPotBuilde: https://jsfiddle.net/5qxkzypk/3/
[03:01:48] <MrCrackPotBuilde> i cant find any display: none;
[03:03:49] <MrCrackPotBuilde> Cork in the whole project from all the partials js files and scss files no display:none; is there another way to call display none
[03:04:18] <Cork> MrCrackPotBuilde: fadeOut sets display:none when it is done
[03:04:31] <Cork> your selector is too wide, check the last jsfiddle it has the fix
[03:04:53] <MrCrackPotBuilde> i integrated that in to the rails app and still the same error
[03:05:10] <Cork> did you change the js selector?
[03:05:28] <Cork> cause the other changes was just to make the jsfiddle usable
[03:06:26] <MrCrackPotBuilde> hhhmmm not sure which selector to choose
[03:06:44] <Cork> choose?
[03:06:50] <MrCrackPotBuilde> portfolio is the main div
[03:06:51] <Cork> i just modified the code you provided
[03:07:08] <MrCrackPotBuilde> scale-anm is what makes it move
[03:07:15] <Cork> uh...
[03:07:18] <MrCrackPotBuilde> its the same as what i have
[03:07:21] <MrCrackPotBuilde> ???
[03:07:23] <Cork> MrCrackPotBuilde: have you even read through the jsfiddle?
[03:07:28] <MrCrackPotBuilde> yep
[03:07:36] <Cork> then have you seen the change i made?
[03:07:47] <MrCrackPotBuilde> it has /3/ on the end right
[03:07:54] <Cork> ya
[03:07:57] <MrCrackPotBuilde> https://jsfiddle.net/5qxkzypk/3/
[03:08:18] <Cork> ya, compare that to the /2/ and you see the js change
[03:08:26] <Cork> THAT is what you need to do
[03:11:23] <MrCrackPotBuilde> i saw it question does this use DOM
[03:11:45] <Cork> what do you mean
[03:11:51] <Cork> *?
[03:12:00] <MrCrackPotBuilde> erm so when the code executes is it using values stored in DOM
[03:12:07] <MrCrackPotBuilde> from when the page loads
[03:12:12] <MrCrackPotBuilde> or just before i forget
[03:12:45] <Cork> MrCrackPotBuilde: uh, have you seen the change i made in the js?
[03:12:52] <MrCrackPotBuilde> i have yes
[03:12:57] <Cork> and it was?
[03:12:58] <MrCrackPotBuilde> still having the same error
[03:13:07] <Cork> then you haven't seen the change
[03:14:01] <MrCrackPotBuilde> no i have its the operator >
[03:14:12] <MrCrackPotBuilde> thats why i asked about dom
[03:14:25] <Cork> as it works with what the page shows yes it does
[03:14:35] <MrCrackPotBuilde> the reason the code was in the html doc in the first place is it failed to work on its own
[03:14:40] <Cork> it just changes the display and opacity value of the page
[03:15:16] <MrCrackPotBuilde> ok i placed it in its own file and included it for pre load and it works
[03:15:18] <MrCrackPotBuilde> thanks so much
[03:15:31] <Cork> ...
[03:15:34] <MrCrackPotBuilde> does the > operater mean from the id to the element
[03:16:08] <Cork> MrCrackPotBuilde: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors
[03:16:49] <Cork> also you should read so you understand the code you have in your page
[03:16:49] <MrCrackPotBuilde> ah thats perfect thank you even better than fixing the code
[03:16:57] <MrCrackPotBuilde> thank you for your help
[03:17:06] <MrCrackPotBuilde> the code i understand
[03:17:13] <MrCrackPotBuilde> its writing it i struggle with
[03:17:16] <Cork> no you don't
[03:17:26] <MrCrackPotBuilde> first it creates an empty variable
[03:17:27] <Cork> as you talked about only changing a class
[03:17:41] <Cork> and the class is the small change that code does
[03:17:51] <MrCrackPotBuilde> then it says if this class is clicked do this function
[03:17:57] <Cork> the major changes is the rest
[04:16:24] <Koopz> aight guys i think i need your help now... there's an API that returns either application/json or application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet depending on what you put in your Accept Header. I somehow need to program a button that triggers the download as Excel output
[04:17:28] <Cork> Koopz: if you send accepts */* what does it default to?
[04:17:39] <Cork> (the default accepts header)
[04:17:43] <Koopz> apparently json
[04:17:49] <Cork> ouch
[04:18:01] <Koopz> well... dev env is somehow excel but production is json
[04:18:15] <Koopz> idk what's going on here but i'd rather fix it on the frontend
[04:18:44] <Cork> you would have to download it as a blob and create a link the user then have to click to save it
[04:18:51] <Cork> so... i would recommend fixing it server side
[04:18:53] <Koopz> what i found so far was a stackoverflow question that fires an AJAX request with the Accept header which then base64 encodes the response and downloads the thing via data
[04:19:01] <Koopz> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24501358/how-to-set-a-header-for-a-http-get-request-and-trigger-file-download/24523253#24523253
[04:19:06] <Cork> no, not base64
[04:19:33] <Koopz> i'm afraid the customer might use some shitty IE8 which doesn't support File API
[04:19:34] <Cork> just to blob download in ajax, but be warned it is not a plessent experience
[04:19:54] <Cork> so again i recommend fixing this so you just do a get request and get the file
[09:08:28] <lietotajs> Hello! Can anyone help me with this problem - Hello! Can anyone help me with this problem?
[09:08:33] <lietotajs> ups
[09:08:49] <lietotajs> Hello! Can anyone help me with this problem - https://jsfiddle.net/Lvs80gd2/3/ ?
[09:09:01] <lietotajs> My goal is to animate .navContentWrap (.slideUp or .slideDown) by using #navContent* height and make #navContent* content fade in and out with transition.
[09:09:09] <lietotajs> For example, if I hover from button one to button down .navContentWrap should expand downwards and one, two, three, four fades out, but five, six, seven, eight fades in.
[09:16:05] <lietotajs> Most likely I am using totally wrong way to make it work...
[12:59:27] <JacquesLacan> Anyone here experienced with jQuery UI?
[13:38:54] <JacquesLacan> https://jsfiddle.net/03eLsaqk/ no luck trying to make the "blur" event fire up
[13:47:31] <grapheti> JacquesLacan, you got two semi-colons (line 8) and no markup
[15:55:49] <devi8> in the animation callbacks, "this" refers to the animated element...if, before the animation, you assigned $(element).data("somedata","somevalue")...can you access "somevvalue" from $(this).data("somedata") inside the animation callback?
[15:57:02] <robertmaxrees> devi8 you could, but that might not be your best bet depending on what you're doing.
[15:59:24] <devi8> YEAH! glad to see you are here! Working on another project like the last one. Trying to create a reusable animation object
[16:00:50] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:02:01] <devi8> https://jsfiddle.net/eusp3vce/
[16:02:43] <devi8> which of course, I would like to store in a data object so a "slide" can either have it's own animation or can use the default
[16:03:41] <robertmaxrees> so what lines am I focusing on here?
[16:03:45] <robertmaxrees> long fiddle.
[16:04:21] <robertmaxrees> also you've got an error with oldComplete.apply(targ));
[16:04:49] <devi8> I am never sure how to use apply or call...
[16:05:08] <devi8> call runs the function with "this" as the paramter, right?
[16:05:13] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[16:05:38] <robertmaxrees> .call() takes the first arg and makes that your 'this' within the function you call it on.
[16:06:13] <robertmaxrees> and then all subsequent args are passed to the functioon.
[16:06:38] <devi8> but then what does apply do? It just passes the argument to the function
[16:06:43] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:07:10] <robertmaxrees> .apply() is similar, in that the first arg is your 'this', but the second arg is an array (or array-like object) that gets split and pass as args.
[16:07:30] <robertmaxrees> to .call(foo, bar, baz) or .apply(foo, [bar, baz])
[16:07:32] <robertmaxrees> *so
[16:07:49] <devi8> oh, that's easier than I was making it.
[16:07:51] <devi8> always
[16:08:28] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:12:03] <devi8> https://jsfiddle.net/eusp3vce/2/
[16:12:18] <robertmaxrees> so whatcha got next?
[16:12:23] <devi8> I think it's gonna work
[16:13:27] <devi8> I should be using translate transform for movement...
[16:14:24] <robertmaxrees> rad
[16:17:16] <devi8> ever other step in the animation, though, logs out as "NaN" for the step parameter.
[16:18:14] <robertmaxrees> where in your code?
[16:18:24] <robertmaxrees> oh, console.log(step+" step"); ?
[16:19:07] <devi8> yeah, I changed it to step, "step" but it still does it
[16:19:27] <robertmaxrees> console.log(typeof step);
[16:19:42] <robertmaxrees> also, where does that get called?
[16:20:10] <devi8> in the animation callback for step
[16:20:15] <robertmaxrees> what line?
[16:20:21] <devi8> line85 I was looking it up
[16:20:34] <robertmaxrees> right, but where does that actually get called from?
[16:21:17] <devi8> I'm not sure how to answer that. When I animate the target, the step function is passed to it.
[16:21:36] <devi8> it's the alternate animation nomenclature
[16:21:53] <devi8> provides a bunch of callback methods.
[16:21:57] <robertmaxrees> where in the code does that happen
[16:22:06] <robertmaxrees> what line invokes that callback
[16:22:53] <devi8> I know you are teaching me something...but I'm missing it. I think the answer is 97
[16:23:10] <devi8> when I call start
[16:23:17] <robertmaxrees> i'm not teaching you anything.
[16:23:23] <robertmaxrees> i'm having a hard time following your code.
[16:23:32] <robertmaxrees> and i can't see where step getys invoked.
[16:23:36] <robertmaxrees> *gets
[16:24:01] <devi8> $("elem").animate(css, {step:function( ){here}, duration:300});
[16:24:27] <devi8> it's built into jquery animate
[16:24:34] <robertmaxrees> so return this.target.animate(this.css, this.animProps()); ?
[16:25:02] <devi8> yes
[16:25:05] <robertmaxrees> okay so.
[16:25:13] <robertmaxrees> when passing a callback.
[16:26:00] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/1pbxu37e/
[16:26:04] <devi8> this.animProps() just combines the callbacks and the animation properties to make an object required by animate
[16:26:08] <robertmaxrees> this is what it essentially boils down to.
[16:26:35] <robertmaxrees> is animProps supposed to be a callback or is that supposed to make args to pass to .animate?
[16:26:46] <devi8> sorry, it makes args
[16:27:08] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[16:27:11] <robertmaxrees> that's different :)
[16:27:16] <devi8> I felt like callbacks should be separate from {duration, easing, queue, specialeasing}
[16:27:53] <devi8> but in jquery animate, they are combined into one object, so this.animProps() just combines them
[16:28:14] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you replace the log in step: with console.log(step); ?
[16:29:25] <riskish> I have some really strange behavior happening. When I am connected to WiFi, and call a function onclick to store data in a db using JS, it works. When I switch to my LTE data plan, all of a sudden it shows the success screen but it's not inserting the data. Any idea why this might be happening?
[16:29:31] <devi8> NANMatrix....so step must not be the time factor, but the attribute step...
[16:29:57] <robertmaxrees> riskish i'd need to see your code.
[16:30:05] <robertmaxrees> for the handler/ajax
[16:30:15] <riskish> let me paste it one sec
[16:35:19] <devi8> oh, I am not getting animate to work with {translate:transform(90px)}   hrmm.
[16:35:45] <robertmaxrees> devi8 erm, jquery's animate wants a specific value.
[16:35:59] <robertmaxrees> if you're gonna use css transforms, just addClass/removeClass instead.
[16:36:17] <devi8> gotcha. Guess I will try absolute positioniing
[16:36:32] <riskish> robertmaxress: this is called when the image is clicked (onclick) https://paste.ofcode.org/9SCTiGMvaRgj7deK5sSNRy
[16:37:38] <robertmaxrees> riskish you realize it'll always run the window.location.replace without waiting for the ajax call, right?
[16:37:59] <riskish> did not know that no
[16:38:07] <robertmaxrees> post is ajax, which means it's async.
[16:38:20] <robertmaxrees> the browser fires that request but keeps going on without waiting.
[16:38:28] <riskish> oh I see
[16:38:31] <robertmaxrees> stick that replace call at the end of the .done() and see if that fixes it.
[16:38:33] <riskish> that makes sense
[16:40:54] <riskish> where do I call done?
[16:41:35] <robertmaxrees> where you have it nowe.
[16:41:43] <robertmaxrees> $.post( "confirm.php", { 'facultyx':facultyx, 'candidateID[]' : candidateID, 'ranking[]': ranking } ).done(function( data ) {
[16:41:48] <robertmaxrees> ^ at the end of this.
[16:42:45] <riskish> ok let me see if this fixes it
[16:44:15] <riskish> robertmaxrees: thank you!!
[16:44:30] <robertmaxrees> that fix it?
[16:45:17] <riskish> yeah it looks like it!
[16:45:21] <riskish> i wasn't getting the alerts
[16:45:25] <robertmaxrees> yep :)
[16:45:29] <riskish> and now i am
[16:45:31] <riskish> and the data is there
[16:45:32] <robertmaxrees> because the page was changing :D
[16:45:34] <riskish> so i assume yes
[16:47:06] <robido> is there an approach I need to take to trigger the css transition I've applied to an element when using .css('left', '20%') for example? It seems to go from 0 to 20% without applying the transition
[16:47:56] <robertmaxrees> robido why not use addClass?
[16:48:04] <robertmaxrees> and let your css manage the rest?
[16:48:16] <robido> well the left position (the one I'm trying to animate) is actually based on a value set in the admin on the page I'm working with
[16:48:26] <robido> so class toggling is a bit out of the question on this particular use case :/
[16:48:38] <robido> perhaps that's why I've never ran into this issue before?
[16:49:06] <robido> I'm also using a cubic bezier curve for my transition, which makes me not want to use .animate because I'd have to add some jquery plugin to support that iirc
[16:50:25] <robido> or is it just a matter of me only applying the transition via a classname and then just applying it with js just shy of setting the property I want to animate?
[16:51:12] <robertmaxrees> i guess I'm lost hah.
[16:51:13] <devi8> you can use Robert Pennier cubic bezier easing function as the "specialEasing" property for jquery animate
[16:53:06] <devi8> but your bigger problem is that it's tricky to animate percentages.
[16:53:20] <robido> oh is that what is the deal?
[16:53:29] <robertmaxrees> well.
[16:53:53] <robido> I may end up just using that plugin to support cubic bezier easing in jQuery, I just wanted to try to figure out as much as I can with css first
[16:54:19] <robertmaxrees> robido why can't you use the class approach I mentioned?
[16:54:41] <devi8> transitions won't animate percentages either, I don't think.
[16:54:56] <robertmaxrees> you sure about that?
[16:55:03] <robido> devi8: they do when I change it in the inspector after the page loads just not with jquery I think
[16:55:30] <devi8> huh. I was trying it earlier and it wasn't working...most likely my issue. I'll check again.
[16:55:31] <robido> robertmaxrees: perhaps I can and I'm just not figuring it out correctly. I moved the CSS transition into a classname and then used addClass just shy of setting the left value with jQuery and that seemed to also not work as expectd
[16:55:48] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/27306884/923919
[16:59:32] <devi8> so it only works with a an ancestor with defined height
[16:59:36] <robido> hah! super weird - had to use addClass and also just do a $(this).css('left'); by itself just shy of setting the left css property with css
[16:59:43] <robido> that was the only way I could get it to transition?
[16:59:47] * robido shrugs
[17:00:46] <robido> yeah I think for relative that's the case
[17:01:01] <robido> in my case it works by itself because they're absolute or something - these all sound like weird edge cases of transitions
[17:01:18] <robido> thanks for the help!
[17:07:49] <lietotajs> Can someone help me understand why I get glicky/double animation when moving y cursor quickly on the button - https://jsfiddle.net/Lvs80gd2/6/ ?
[17:08:00] <lietotajs> It is driving me crazy.
[17:09:22] <lietotajs> .fadeIn
[17:09:32] <devi8> lietotajs, I've never seen css('transition') done that way...interesting.
[17:10:34] <lietotajs> I am new tojQuery/js, so I must be doing something wrong.
[17:10:51] <lietotajs> Took me whole day to get this far.
[17:11:03] <devi8> You may want to do this in css and just add/subtract a class from the element on hover
[17:12:28] <lissitzki> ehi ehi, similar problem here: https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/q1dcbwnf/2/
[17:12:36] <lietotajs> devi8 if you look at this https://jsfiddle.net/Lvs80gd2/4/, you might understand why I am doing it this way.
[17:12:58] <lissitzki> it is supposed to show the submenu on click but it doesn't, i'd love to know what i'm doing wrong
[17:14:17] <lietotajs> I need my background to expand and shrink to the height of children - slide up and slide down.
[17:15:42] <lissitzki> i think i know my problem
[17:15:43] <lietotajs> I know code is wasteful and not good, but just need to get this prototype working.
[17:16:04] <lissitzki> ok i did it
[17:18:04] <devi8> lissitzki,is that valid HTML? Is it okay to have a div as a direct child of a ul?
[17:18:25] <lissitzki> no, right
[17:18:57] <devi8> lietotajs, you should use delegation so that you only have one "hover" method that applies to whoever is hovered
[17:20:14] <lietotajs> Mmmm?
[17:20:28] <lietotajs> Goes over my head.
[17:21:09] <devi8> np. gimme a second and I'll show ya
[17:21:20] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[17:21:30] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[17:22:33] <robertmaxrees> fwiw
[17:26:00] <devi8> https://jsfiddle.net/Lvs80gd2/7/
[17:26:47] <devi8> but there is a better way to do it, I just never get that right...it's something like $(*#navbar").on(".btn",{mouseover: ....
[17:27:08] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:27:31] <robertmaxrees> that's... not a delegated handler heh
[17:27:52] <devi8> how so. navbar is handling the mouseover events
[17:27:56] <devi8> for all of it's children
[17:28:04] <lietotajs> Ok, this will take another day to understand.
[17:28:20] <robertmaxrees> contextually, on() has a specific sytax for delegated handlers.
[17:28:29] <robertmaxrees> while yours is similar, it's kind of a misnomer.
[17:28:36] <lietotajs> But it is not working.
[17:29:06] <robertmaxrees> $('element').on('event', 'child', callback) <- if you check out the links I shared out, you'll see the explanation for this.
[17:33:43] <devi8> the concept of delegation---by definition is letting one thing handle the events of it's children. in the official delegation syntactic sugar that $(elem).on(event, child, callback) offers only allows delegation of a declared child...whereas using e.target provides the same benefit, but allows all children to be handled by one event handler...how is that wrong?--not questioning your validity,
[17:33:44] <devi8> just not understanding the nuance here
[17:34:46] <robertmaxrees> only that in jquery, when we refer to "delegated handlers", i'd argue most people are referring to the syntax I noted above.
[17:34:52] <robertmaxrees> that's all.
[17:34:59] <robertmaxrees> it's a subtle difference, and functionally similar.
[17:35:16] <robertmaxrees> but the naming can throw people off :)
[17:35:21] <lietotajs> I am lost XD
[17:35:42] <devi8> you rock, robertmaxrees, thanks for the clarification.
[17:36:00] <robertmaxrees> but also - " offers only allows delegation of a declared child"
[17:36:08] <robertmaxrees> how is this different from your solution?
[17:36:42] <devi8> $("elem").on("click",".btn", function () ) only handles .btn elements, mine handles every element
[17:36:49] <robertmaxrees> you can use a wildcard there.
[17:36:54] <robertmaxrees> or any other valid selector.
[17:37:02] <robertmaxrees> but generally you don't want to handle "all" elements.
[17:38:14] <devi8> lietotajs, here is the deal: you have one thing that you want to have happen for each of your navigatoin buttons...so write that function once.
[17:38:48] <devi8> then you find a parent of all those buttons and tell it to listen to when one of the buttons is clicked..when it gets that click, fire the method you just defined on it
[17:39:10] <devi8> then if you have a problem with it not working, there's one place to check  not one for every button
[17:40:48] <lietotajs> I understand, that repeating is dumb and not proper.
[17:41:17] <devi8> more importantly, it's easier not to
[17:41:37] <devi8> it takes a lot more work to copy the solution to every button
[17:41:50] <devi8> then if there's a mistake, you have to remember to fix every button
[17:42:18] <devi8> and if you used explicit variables in your function, you have to remember to change those in every button.
[17:42:47] <devi8> before long you have a nightmare--it's not easier to write repetitive code..it's easier to delegate it once
[17:43:06] <lietotajs> mouseover: function(e) what does "e" stand for?
[17:43:20] <robertmaxrees> the event object.
[17:43:22] <devi8> e is the event that is passed to all jquery events
[17:43:36] <devi8> so event "hover" gets an 'e' vent
[17:43:54] <devi8> *even "hover" gets an e-vent...lol terrible typo
[17:44:12] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[17:44:12] <lietotajs> var el = $(e.target).closest("div"); this targets closest child or parent?
[17:44:24] <robertmaxrees> closest goes "up"
[17:44:28] <robertmaxrees> through ancestors.
[17:44:34] <robertmaxrees> and gets the first element that matches the selector.
[17:45:11] <devi8> we put <span class='btn'> around the button text so that we know when the mouse is over the button text
[17:45:39] <lietotajs> So, in this case, why I am looking for parent. Should I not look for the first child?
[17:45:59] <devi8> there is no child of span elements
[17:47:47] <devi8> I'm not familiar with your HTML, but if you have a submenu as the child (after the span element), you still have to get the element above your button to find the submenu..perhaps you could put class='submenu" on the submenu content
[17:47:52] <robertmaxrees> if you used some semantic classes and the syntax i noted, this would be a lot easier :)
[17:48:03] <devi8> What he said
[17:48:58] <devi8> robertmaxrees, so you'd use $(this).parent().children(".submenu")  instead of $(e.target).closest("div").children(".submenu");
[17:49:22] <devi8> faster your way no doubt
[17:49:53] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:50:15] <robertmaxrees> ideally, your second arg would be the parent element itself.
[17:50:17] <robertmaxrees> then .find();
[17:50:46] <robertmaxrees> $('#theCOntainer').on('mouseenter', 'theParent', function() {});
[17:51:12] <devi8> this is why I am always getting delegation your way wrong.
[17:51:15] <robertmaxrees> then $(this).find('.submenu') or w/e.
[17:52:18] <devi8> but if you have overlapping content in side of your parent elements, it will go wonky, won't it?
[17:52:32] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:52:37] * devi8 thinks--maybe not if content is display:none
[17:52:46] <robertmaxrees> is the content a child of the parent?
[17:53:27] <devi8> it looks like it is...the content, submenu and the button text are all inside one element...it appears
[17:53:47] <robertmaxrees> then why would it go wonky?
[17:53:57] <robertmaxrees> mouseenter and mouseleave are key for this.
[17:54:38] <devi8> so delegating to the parent element (with overlapping submenus) would fire the event on the top submenu, which may not be the one you want...
[17:54:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:54:53] <devi8> one sec.
[17:54:54] <robertmaxrees> then you're not binding to the proper element heh
[17:56:21] <robertmaxrees> so there are main menues and then submenus?
[17:57:00] <lietotajs> There are six menu buttons, then there are one level of submenus.
[17:59:41] <lietotajs> From devil8 example, $("#navbar").on({  mouseover: function(e) { this starts function, when cursor enters #navbar, var el = $(e.target).closest("div"); looks for first parent div, var content = el.find("div"); looks for first child div of the parent we just found?
[18:00:17] <robertmaxreesd> so then you have 4 separate handlers - mouseenter and mouseleave on the parents, then mouseenter and mouseleave for the subs
[18:12:26] <devi8> https://jsfiddle.net/5v6o1ya0/1/   <--robertmaxrees
[18:12:54] <devi8> what am I doing wrong with my delegation there.? if you uncomment the lines, it works fine--but it's not the expected way
[18:14:30] <roberBusy> first off - it's mouseover and mouseout
[18:14:53] <roberBusy> second, remvoeClass is a typo
[18:15:42] <robertmaxrees> tho i'd use mouseenter and mouseleave for this.
[18:16:55] <devi8> but fixing those stupid mistakes, the submenu disappears as soon asyou mouse over it
[18:17:02] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[18:17:12] <devi8> https://jsfiddle.net/5v6o1ya0/2/
[18:18:11] <robertmaxrees> the code is being too generic.
[18:19:18] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/5v6o1ya0/3/
[18:24:23] <devi8> okay, here is finally what I was talking about: if you have a large submenu and all of your submenus appear in the same location (overlapping), your delegation creates a problem: https://jsfiddle.net/5v6o1ya0/4/
[18:24:58] <devi8> or is it only because display:none that it works
[18:25:25] <robertmaxrees> wat
[18:26:06] <devi8> in this last fiddle, I have large overlapping submenus...this happens a lot with these "mega menus" so handling the mouseover event on the item causes problems
[18:28:57] <robertmaxrees> that's because you're using opacity.
[18:29:00] <robertmaxrees> the element is still there.
[18:29:28] <robertmaxrees> and top: 50px; on .submenu
[18:29:36] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5v6o1ya0/6/
[18:31:12] <devi8> excellent. thank you. How can you delegate multiple events...looking on the links you provided
[18:31:19] <robertmaxrees> "multiple events"?
[18:31:47] <robertmaxrees> like, apply the same handler for multiple events, you mean?
[18:33:12] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/etz4deyL/
[18:33:14] <devi8> like $(nav).on({mouseover:function() {}, mouseout:function () {});   is there a way to delegate mutliple events like that
[18:33:17] <robertmaxrees> you'
[18:33:24] <robertmaxrees> *you're not "creating" events though.
[18:33:39] <robertmaxrees> and imo that object syntax isn't all that great.
[18:33:42] <devi8> sorry, event handlers. thanks. for keeping me in line.
[18:35:43] <robertmaxrees> are you tyring to avoid the lookups for the elements?
[18:37:51] <devi8> no intentions--just trying to do things right. I wasn't sure if you did multiple $("nav").on(event, child, func) or if you could do them all at once...either way is fine by me.
[18:38:30] <robertmaxrees> the "right" way (at least, the way most folks do it) is $('foo').on('event', 'child', handler);
[18:39:05] <robertmaxrees> you can also chain off the initial .on() if you want.
[18:39:16] <devi8> gotit, I'll practice it that way now. As always, you have been a tremendous help.
[18:39:22] <robertmaxrees> rad
[19:54:40] <Rockwood> https://kopy.io/pVZGZ why it undefined ?
[19:55:34] <robertmaxrees> Rockwood depends on what data is.
[19:55:50] <Rockwood> data is in json format
[19:56:07] <robertmaxrees> can you share what r is?
[19:56:11] <robertmaxrees> console.log(r);
[19:56:24] <Rockwood> okay
[19:56:37] <robertmaxrees> pop that into a fiddle or something.
[19:57:55] <Rockwood> fiddle is free ?
[19:58:08] <robertmaxrees> you could use kopy.io if you wanted.
[19:58:10] <robertmaxrees> doesn't really matter.
[19:58:18] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, jsfiddle is free.
[20:00:19] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/ggsjL1a6/
[20:00:33] <robertmaxrees> so in that case.
[20:00:38] <robertmaxrees> data doesn't need to be parsed.
[20:00:51] <Rockwood> then ?
[20:01:04] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ggsjL1a6/1/
[20:04:29] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[20:05:51] <Rockwood> but still getting undefined
[20:06:12] <robertmaxrees> okay, so let's try this:
[20:06:18] <robertmaxrees> go to your network tab and find the request.
[20:06:24] <robertmaxrees> copy the data out from the response there.
[20:06:28] <robertmaxrees> so we can see the raw data.
[20:06:33] <Rockwood> okay
[20:12:12] <robertmaxrees> any luck?
[20:12:13] <Rockwood> https://unsee.cc/b520da94/
[20:12:21] <Rockwood> no luck still
[20:12:30] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[20:12:37] <robertmaxrees> that link doesn't work for me.
[20:12:42] <Rockwood> okay
[20:12:44] <robertmaxrees> i need to see the data itself.
[20:13:16] <Rockwood> [{id: 1, depname: "SSC", created_at: "2017-12-14 02:26:09", updated_at: "2017-12-14 02:26:09",…}]0{id: 1, depname: "SSC", created_at: "2017-12-14 02:26:09", updated_at: "2017-12-14 02:26:09",…}
[20:13:25] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[20:13:31] <Rockwood> means
[20:13:45] <robertmaxrees> try data[0].depname
[20:13:48] <robertmaxrees> without the parse.
[20:16:19] <robertmaxrees> it looks like your server is sending an array back.
[20:16:44] <Rockwood> output looks like just --->>> [
[20:16:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:17:02] <Rockwood> of console.log(data[0])
[20:17:12] <robertmaxrees> hah - then yeah, you'll need the parse./
[20:17:26] <robertmaxrees> so parse data, then [0].depname off that.
[20:20:44] <Rockwood> https://kopy.io/KZ2iL
[20:20:54] <robertmaxrees> nonono
[20:20:54] <robertmaxrees> var  h = jQuery.parseJSON(data[0]);
[20:20:56] <robertmaxrees> woops -
[20:21:12] <robertmaxrees> var  h = jQuery.parseJSON(data);
[20:21:15] <robertmaxrees> then console.log(h[0]);
[20:21:24] <Rockwood> k
[20:22:10] <Rockwood> {id: 1, depname: "SSC", created_at: "2017-12-14 02:26:09", updated_at: "2017-12-14 02:26:09", deleted_at: null}  wow awesome
[20:22:15] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it's an array.
[20:22:18] <Rockwood> this my new output
[20:22:22] <robertmaxrees> are you in control of the server?
[20:22:28] <Rockwood> yes
[20:22:31] <robertmaxrees> i'
[20:22:37] <robertmaxrees> *i'd fix that output then.
[20:23:21] <Rockwood> one more question Ajax is outdated ?
[20:23:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:24:18] <Rockwood> new alternative of ajax is available
[20:24:25] <robertmaxrees> you mean the fetch api
[20:24:30] <Rockwood> yes
[20:24:45] <robertmaxrees> depends on if you need to support old browsers or not.
[20:25:20] <Rockwood> fetch not supports olders ?
[20:25:27] <Rockwood> fetch up not supports olders ?
[20:25:38] <robertmaxrees> some browsers don't support it.
[20:26:27] <Rockwood> ajax have any problem ?
[20:26:40] <robertmaxrees> you mean $.ajax()?
[20:27:01] <Rockwood> or  yes
[20:27:13] <robertmaxrees> nothing I'm aware of.
[20:27:42] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you using?
[20:30:23] <Rockwood> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js
[20:30:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah okay.
[20:30:34] <robertmaxrees> so you don't want to use success: or error:
[20:30:39] <robertmaxrees> swap to .then().catch()
[20:34:10] <Rockwood> can see example of .then().catch()
[20:34:22] <Rockwood> success: like this
[20:34:48] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax(/* your config */).then(function(data) {}).catch(function() {});
[20:39:09] <Rockwood> something like this https://kopy.io/aDZTD
[20:39:19] <robertmaxrees> not in the options.
[20:39:50] <robertmaxrees> https://kopy.io/YXcfJ
[20:51:30] <Rockwood> now my request is completed then i want just get data to php only instead html layout
[20:51:44] <Rockwood> in array format
[20:52:45] <Rockwood> i wanna send data to php by jquery
[20:55:28] <robertmaxrees> huh
[20:55:28] <robertmaxrees> ?
[20:55:34] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to send back?
[20:57:36] <lietotajs> Got this far https://jsfiddle.net/L26kbh5c/1/, but now my sub-nav collapses when I leave green or orange containers.
[20:59:00] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:59:06] <lietotajs> It must be something about .mouseenter and .mouseover, but I can not figure it out.
[21:00:03] <lietotajs> Code is still s**t, but I am going in the right direction, I hope.
[21:00:17] <devi8> lietotajs, I gotta give you credit for trying your hand at delegation. Don't get down on yourself. It's all a learning process.
[21:00:23] <robertmaxrees> :)
[21:00:51] <devi8> Try to think about your project more abstractly...
[21:01:21] <devi8> Rather than referring directly to each button anywhere, only think about the current button and all other buttons
[21:01:38] <devi8> that way if you have five buttons, you don't have to code for all five buttons
[21:01:58] <robertmaxrees> ie don't use IDs
[21:02:35] <lietotajs> But it wont help me with the collapsing part :)
[21:02:41] <robertmaxrees> heh
[21:02:45] <lietotajs> Or will it?
[21:02:47] <robertmaxrees> you're making it too complicated :)
[21:02:47] <devi8> so your button contents get the "show" class to make them visible. then all other content elements need to not have "show"
[21:04:48] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you're making this really complex heh
[21:05:30] <devi8> but don't feel bad...I am absolutely the kind of making it more complex than it needs to be. seriously.
[21:06:35] <lietotajs> Something like if != content.removeClass("btnActive");?
[21:07:40] <lietotajs> Uhh, getting tiered.
[21:07:43] <devi8> first off. let's talk about menu items. It is almost always better to use anchor elements for your navigation links. This way, worst case scenario, your links at least work to get to your actual content
[21:08:12] <devi8> so instead of <div>menuoption</div> use <a class='menuOption' href='#thecontent">the content</a>
[21:11:02] <lietotajs> I get that.
[21:17:24] <devi8> https://jsfiddle.net/L26kbh5c/4/
[21:17:36] <devi8> here's the basic idea...Now for the rolling down part.
[21:18:07] <devi8> actually, you got that handled in your css for show.
[21:25:48] <lietotajs> Fixed one typo and got it working. Now I only have to get the background working.
[21:25:54] <lietotajs> Thanks for all your help.
