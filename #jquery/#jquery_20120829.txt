[01:00:21] <rgr> how can one run javascript after another js lib has loaded? I generate a load of js snippets on the fly that need jquery and my own library, my library is laoded after jquery, I want to run these snippets after my lib is loaded. I could just store them all in a document global and loop on that in the documentReady for my library I know but was wondering if there is a better / neater way.
[01:05:49] <dagnatt1> given this string in a variable <div id="293tips"><b>Hav, navn (Barentshavet, Norskehavet, Nordsjoen):</b></div><div id="350tips"><b>Europa kart:</b>null</div> HOw can I remove the div with id="293tips"? If it is in the dom its $("#293tips).remove() but it is in a variable...
[01:06:45] <Clex> rgr: what about https://github.com/linkedin/inject ?
[01:07:41] <Clex> dagnatt1: what do you mean "it's in a variable"? $('#id').remove() should work.
[01:08:11] <dagnatt1> Clex: I would like the result to be a string aswell...
[01:08:23] <xec_> dagnatt1: make it dom temporarily, then remove and extract the html
[01:08:49] <dagnatt1> ecthiender: how?
[01:09:25] <ecthiender> dagnatt1, excuse me :O
[01:09:42] <xec_> dagnatt1: var temp = $("<div>").html(myHtmlString); temp.find("#id").remove();
[01:09:56] <xec_> dagnatt1: now you have the html available as temp.html()
[01:14:09] <gloomer> dagnatt1 http://jsfiddle.net/VP9Hj/
[01:14:11] <gloomer> this works as well
[01:14:44] <dagnatt1> xec_: cheers!
[01:14:52] <xec_> gloomer: not really
[01:15:31] <xec_> i mean, look at the result and you see the issue
[01:16:44] <xec_> gloomer: passing html directly to the $() function requires a single root element, and since this has two "root" divs only the first gets parsed
[01:17:44] <gloomer> you are correct
[01:18:30] <guy> $('thead').on('resize', function(){}) any particular reason why this doesn't work?
[01:19:28] <gloomer> xec_ http://jsfiddle.net/VP9Hj/1/
[01:20:30] <faraway> guy: resize event is for the window
[01:20:49] <guy> how to detect when thead width has changed?
[01:21:09] <radiodario> http://jqueryui.com/demos/resizable/
[01:21:27] <xec_> gloomer: i hadn't expected that to work tbh - but you're still missing the second div, you only get the innerHTML of it
[01:22:30] <faraway> guy: there are scripts that check on regular intervals if the size changed, but this is not a really good solution.
[01:22:40] <guy> faraway: thus I ask.
[01:23:33] <guy> uh. silly me. $(window) resize is just as good for me.
[01:23:45] <faraway> guy: you need to think of when and why the size could change and then check at this situation (i know that would probably not be possible always)
[01:25:53] <guy> "(i know that would probably not be possible always)" I can hardly think of any situation, unless the user is messing directly with the DOM
[01:29:06] <xec_> gloomer: it appears my previous statement was false. it's just the .html() that choose the first element in the collection
[01:30:17] <faraway> guy: a situation could be if you use 3rd party code where you don't have full control of what and when it is doing something :D  or if you need to load style  from cross domain or font where you don't know when they have finished loading. not common but it could happen.
[01:30:24] <mazzachre> What is the recommended way of defining sitewide default options objects? I am looking at making our entire site a little more legible and also a bit more consistent, by standardizing a lot of the options given to jQuery and jQueryUI calls (Stuff that takes css, a number of error handlers etc.)
[01:31:40] <gloomer> thanks for the clarification xec_, http://jsfiddle.net/VP9Hj/1/ that seems more concise
[01:32:58] <gloomer> fun puzzle http://jsfiddle.net/GraffitiLabs/Sm9mV/
[01:33:19] <xec_> gloomer: true, but it doesn't just remove the first div from the string, it removes the second container html too, so the .html(str) is still easier in this case
[01:34:05] <sivang> hi all
[01:35:03] <sivang> I'm trying to make jquery validate, and I've followed the example here http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation#Example
[01:35:25] <gloomer> ya I agree and makes more since to read later on
[01:35:28] <sivang> My submit is through postJSON, e.g. out of band, but I did not suspect that jquery can only validate through submit
[01:35:57] <sivang> so, if anybody can help me work out jquery validate please?
[01:36:48] <gloomer> sivang you should be able to call $('#yourForm').validate();
[01:37:02] <sivang> gloomer: I did that, but the form still is submitted without any validation occuring
[01:37:04] <gloomer> sivang you should be able to call $('#yourForm').valid();
[01:37:15] <sivang> gloomer: 11:36 < sivang> gloomer: I did that, but the form still is submitted without any validation occuring
[01:37:40] <sivang> gloomer: nor error message showing even if I set validate({ debug: true})
[01:37:52] <sivang> gloomer: any idea further?
[01:38:51] <gloomer> humm, do you have some code?
[01:39:33] <sivang> gloomer: yes, I can paste it up, just a sec.
[01:43:20] <sivang> gloomer: this is the form, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1173418/
[01:43:53] <sivang> gloomer: you know what, that is incomplete, just a sec making a new paste
[01:44:25] <sivang> gloomer: html page, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1173420/
[01:44:57] <sivang> gloomer: script.js - http://paste.ubuntu.com/1173422/
[01:45:07] <gloomer> k one sec
[01:45:09] <sivang> gloomer: let me know if you need more pastes
[01:46:35] <code_ph0y> hey guys can someone tell me how to uppercase the first letters in a sentence so ..... like This Is What I Wanna Do?
[01:47:52] <blackspotwiggins> code_ph0y, text-transform:capitalize in css
[01:48:28] <code_ph0y> nice i'll remember that! ... but its kinda through a javascript var
[01:48:44] <code_ph0y> so it will have to be done in the javascript
[01:50:26] <rev_icon> and text-transform isnt very cross browser compatible
[01:51:20] <rev_icon> try this
[01:51:21] <rev_icon> var str = "hello world";
[01:51:21] <rev_icon> str = str.toLowerCase().replace(/\b[a-z]/g, function(letter) {
[01:51:21] <rev_icon>     return letter.toUpperCase();
[01:51:21] <rev_icon> });
[01:51:21] <rev_icon> alert(str); //Displays "Hello World"
[01:51:27] <xec_> rev_icon: what?
[01:51:57] <blackspotwiggins> ehh
[01:53:04] <radiodario> clever regexes are clever
[01:53:15] <Cork> rev_icon: except that only works for english
[01:53:38] <xec_> rev_icon: please don't paste lines of code in the channel. and why would you think text-transform: capitalize; isn't well supported? what's your source?
[01:54:09] <rev_icon> xec: I was incorrect about text-transform, my bad.   Why is pasting code bad?
[01:54:39] <Cork> rev_icon: 1. its spammy, 2. its harder to read then it has to be, 3. its hard to copy the code 4...
[01:54:40] <blackspotwiggins> split by " ", toUpperCase the first letter
[01:54:43] <xec_> rev_icon: because it takes up a lot of space and actual messages get lost in the spam. use a pastebin
[01:54:45] <blackspotwiggins> and join
[01:55:20] <rev_icon> spammy means something altogether different to me, but sure, I'll refrain from helping out with coding problems.
[01:55:41] <Cork> rev_icon: if you really want to help out use a pb see ?p
[01:55:53] <Cork> oh... bot-t is dead again >_>
[01:56:41] * shoky requiem bot-t
[01:56:54] <code_ph0y> back!
[01:57:00] <code_ph0y> thanks rev_icon!
[01:57:38] <rev_icon> code_ph0y: You bet!  Be warned as others pointed out that this is only really a good solution for english.
[01:59:48] <code_ph0y> what about scottish :S
[01:59:50] <code_ph0y> ?
[01:59:52] <code_ph0y> :P
[02:00:10] <rev_icon> that regex is up to you to write :)  Have fun
[02:00:18] <code_ph0y> yeah thats cool its only gonna be for english :P
[02:00:25] <code_ph0y> thanks again!
[02:07:49] <code_ph0y> another question is there an easier way to get the form? when a button is assigned to it forexample .... id="btn_example" with in a form ... how would I get the form element? is it something like getParent?
[02:10:05] <shoky> code_ph0y: easier than what?
[02:10:17] <Cork> code_ph0y: $('#btn_example').closest('form').find('input, select, textarea')
[02:10:30] <Cork> or replace the first one with this if you have it
[02:10:58] <code_ph0y> nice Cork thanks i'll try that the now
[02:11:10] <Cork> or if your doing a submit you should be using the submit event on the form
[02:11:18] <Cork> and $().serialize
[02:14:32] <Jennifer23> i've get data input of text box using jQuery.ajax({success:function(data){alert(data);})} i want to success this after typing, how can i add delay from this?
[02:18:29] <AdvoWork> Hi there, i'm sending the contents of a text area to a php file, but it's breaking if i have ' in it, ie aren't  any idea how I can escape that for sending to php?
[02:18:47] <Afflicto> How do I bind a click event to all elements in $("#pages") with the id of "page_edit" ? I tried doing $("#pages").find("#page_edit").click(function.... but it doesn't work.
[02:20:54] <rev_icon> Afflicto: you realize you can only have one element with an ID of page_edit right?
[02:21:15] <Afflicto> huh? o.O
[02:21:22] <shoky> ID = identity
[02:21:29] <rev_icon> ids are unique on a page
[02:21:33] <shoky> two elements can't share identity plz
[02:21:38] <Afflicto> No I didn't. loool. All my other scripts seems to work fine?
[02:21:48] <shoky> in IE6?
[02:21:54] <rev_icon> oh man
[02:22:19] <rev_icon> please fix your code, it will break in all kinds of weird ways when you least expect it.   if you need to identify multiple elements, use classes instead
[02:22:25] <Afflicto> Who uses IE. but I do realize from a design standpoint that they are unique, but why then  does it usually work? I mean if it never worked, I would have found out :P
[02:22:53] <shoky> we could break down each case and see why it worked for you, but that would be boring and missing the point ;P
[02:22:57] <rev_icon> the browser will try to make it work, but it will break in all kinds of ways when you least expect it.
[02:23:31] <xdjuj__> Do you know if it's possible to "reset" a css "position:relative", I have a div that already have position:relative, but I need to "cancel" it, not to give it another position, but to "position:none" in order to use position absolute on some childs of this div but absolute with the parent of this div, not this div...
[02:23:47] <Afflicto> Ok, I changed to class instead but it still doesn't work. nothing happens. $("#pages").find(".page_edit").click(function(){alert(1)});
[02:23:47] <xdjuj__> (i'm not sure it's easy to understand :p)
[02:23:51] <shoky> xdjuj__: position:static
[02:24:19] <xdjuj__> shoky right !
[02:24:22] <xdjuj__> Thanks :)
[02:24:27] <shoky> ;]
[02:24:41] <xdjuj__> Afflicto why not jQuery("#pages .page_edit").click ?
[02:25:46] <Afflicto> pages -> tbody -> tr -> td -> ul -> li > a.page_edit. :P
[02:26:10] <Afflicto> I dont want to write all that on each function I want >.<
[02:26:14] <xec_> -.-
[02:26:38] <shoky> Afflicto: are those <a>'s dynamically added to the DOM at runtime?
[02:26:48] <Afflicto> nope, echoed by php
[02:27:14] <shoky> then $('#pages .page_edit') should work fine   (or $('#pages').find('.page edit') )
[02:27:17] <Afflicto> and I also put it in document.ready.
[02:27:19] <shoky> you got something else wrong
[02:27:41] <Afflicto> Probably, cause I've done this hundreds of times and I'm doing the same thing xP
[02:27:42] <shoky> .page_edit, that is
[02:28:34] <seutje> Afflicto: consider using .on() like $('#pages').on('click', '.page_edit', function() { ... })
[02:29:52] <seutje> that'll delegate the clicks to the #pages element and check if the selector matches, should be more performant and AJAX-proof
[02:30:23] <Afflicto> yea, I actually do plan to implement ajax pagination, so I guess I'll try anyway.
[02:31:11] <Afflicto> lol, still doesn't work. :\
[02:31:25] <shoky> my guess is typo
[02:32:03] <Afflicto> Don't think so, I've looked at this for 30 mins now :P
[02:32:09] <shoky> break it down
[02:32:23] <shoky> does $('#pages') work good. if so, does .find('page_edit') work good
[02:32:27] <shoky> console.log them
[02:32:34] <shoky> figure it out ;]
[02:32:59] <seutje> is it an element with class "page_edit" or is it a <page_edit> element? o.O
[02:33:12] <seutje> coz I think ur midding a dot there
[02:33:15] <shoky> uh that was my typo, disregard that
[02:33:19] <shoky> he did put a dot..
[02:33:49] <seutje> oh ok, sry
[02:34:04] <Afflicto> FUU** SHI***
[02:34:24] <Afflicto> Turns out, I have a menu with id of "pages". -,-
[02:35:38] <seutje> ಠ__ಠ
[02:38:00] <Palanivel> i have small doubt..........i have var ss = ["abc","def","ghi"] like this array......i want ss= ["abc","","ghi"] like that........how to do......am tried regex but am not get........any idea?????????
[02:39:21] <shoky> umm
[02:39:26] <shoky> ss[1] = "";
[02:39:27] <shoky> ?
[02:40:32] <HeN> something is strange about 1.8.0, $.ajax wont execute if the server host starts with "www." , havent tried yet other versions
[02:41:50] <shoky> doubts
[02:42:06] <NodeX> HeN : cross domain?
[02:42:40] <HeN> NodeX: same domain
[02:42:57] <HeN> actually I dont contain any 'url' option in it
[02:43:15] <faraway> HeN: sure it is not a request from domain.tld to www.domain.tld ?
[02:44:02] <shoky> no url is a recipe for success
[02:44:07] <HeN> faraway: sure. as I said I dont give it any 'url'
[02:44:24] <faraway> HeN: sorry have send it before i got that messge
[02:45:24] <Palanivel> @shoky......ooooooooooohhhhhhhhhh simple thing.......am thinkin diff way........anyway thankz
[02:45:29] <quicksilver> shoky: actually there is a URL with the recipe to success but now I've found it I'm keeping it to myself :)
[02:45:35] <HeN> oh I'm sorry I was looking at the wrong place the url option is 'page.php'
[02:46:05] <HeN> but still not mentioning any domain in url
[02:47:04] <faraway> HeN: did you check for errors in the console or in the network info of the dev tools ?
[02:47:06] <Afflicto> how can I define a global variable \ constant in JS?
[02:47:20] <HeN> faraway: yep, using firebug no errors or outputs at all
[02:47:23] <Clex> Afflicto: without the prefix "var".
[02:47:34] <HeN> seems like it just doesnt get executed
[02:47:48] <Clex> But that's usually a very wrong thing to do.
[02:47:58] <Afflicto> Clex: that's what I did but it's not working. lol :P
[02:48:28] <Clex> I can assure you it does. :)
[02:48:51] <Clex> Maybe you're calling this variable before it was set.
[02:48:53] <faraway> Afflicto: instead without var you should use window.YourGlobal but as Clex said you should avoid it
[02:49:41] <shoky> quicksilver: :P
[02:50:08] <Afflicto> ok it seems alert(url) works, but I can't do $.post(url + "pages/delete/" + id, function(data){}); it just says literally url + ...
[02:50:29] <Clex> Afflicto: because url isn't set yet.
[02:50:35] <Afflicto> It is.
[02:50:42] <Clex> Then it works.
[02:50:44] <Afflicto> alert(url) works fine :P
[02:50:55] <blackspotwiggins> dont use alert for debugging
[02:50:55] <Afflicto> but it says "url".
[02:51:13] <blackspotwiggins> then you are doing var url = "url" somewhere
[02:51:24] <shoky> don't use globals
[02:51:30] <Afflicto> alert(url) = "http:/dev/mvc3/". $.post(url + "string"): = url
[02:51:42] <shoky> and fyi, not using var is not the way to define a global :\
[02:52:06] <blackspotwiggins> Afflicto, paste your code and/or jsfiddle an example
[02:52:59] <Afflicto> shit. nevermind I'm just being retarded XD
[02:53:36] <Clex> shoky: what then?
[02:53:43] <faraway> shoky: pssst that a js secret .. like that it does not matter where in the function that "var whatEver; " is placed :D
[02:53:46] <shoky> Clex: using 'var' in the global scope
[02:53:51] <Afflicto> I was expecting the JS on the source view to print out the values of everything hahaha
[02:53:56] <Clex> shoky: what if you have different files?
[02:54:12] <shoky> Clex: regardless of that.
[02:54:24] <Clex> I mean without inline coding.
[02:54:37] <shoky> Clex: either you're in the global scope, or you are not
[02:54:47] <shoky> regardless of what file the code is coming from..
[02:54:49] <Clex> JavaScript isn't client-side only.
[02:54:54] <shoky> so?
[02:55:34] <Clex> There's no common scope between files if you use node.
[02:56:28] <Clex> To set a global variable in JavaScript you must set it without the "var" prefix. "var" means local to the scope, so not global.
[02:56:32] <shoky> Clex:   someVar = someValue    means set someVar in the current scope
[02:56:40] <shoky> and if it doesnt exist in the current scope, set it in the global
[02:56:41] <Clex> Regardless of how big the scope is.
[02:56:44] <shoky> or something like that
[02:57:03] <seutje> should I grab some popcorn for this cage match?
[02:57:04] <Clex> shoky: nope, "var someVar = someValue;" does.
[02:57:14] <shoky> so it might have a side-effect of defining a new global var
[02:57:19] <shoky> but it's not the way to do so
[02:57:53] <shoky> Clex: no, "var someVar = someValue"  means define a new variable in the current scope and set it..
[02:58:14] <Clex> shoky: yes.
[02:58:17] <Clex> < shoky> Clex:   someVar = someValue    means set someVar in the current scope
[02:58:20] <Clex> This does not.
[02:58:29] <shoky> right, it means what i said it does
[02:58:29] <blackspotwiggins> it might
[02:58:44] <blackspotwiggins> if you have var someVar; on previous line
[02:58:58] <shoky> then it will set someVar in the current scope, yah
[02:59:01] <blackspotwiggins> it goes up the scope chain until it reaches top
[02:59:54] <shoky> yah that's a more complete description
[03:00:21] <faraway> blackspotwiggins: it does not matter in which line the " var someVar" : http://jsfiddle.net/X2cPX/1/
[03:00:32] <shoky> he knows
[03:00:40] <blackspotwiggins> the way i'd get a surefire top scope is (function(){ this.someVar = someValue }())
[03:00:46] <blackspotwiggins> faraway, yea sorry
[03:03:19] <shoky> and Clex - i'll admit i don't know node too much so maybe what i said may be wrong (that the way to define a global is to use var in the global scope)
[03:03:36] <shoky> but what i first said still holds- not using var is NOT the way to define a global
[03:03:49] <shoky> so in node maybe the way is global.someVar = someValue;   i donno
[03:04:01] <shoky> but definitely NOT someVar = someValue;
[03:10:42] <HeN> hey guys $.ajax wont execute if server host is www.domain.tld but will work fine if server host is domain.told, no errors or outputs on console, any suggestions?
[03:11:41] <blackspotwiggins> ?sop @ HeN
[03:11:41] <bot-t> HeN, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[03:12:02] <caddoo> I have a <tr> in the var myVar; how do I select a link that is in the last td.
[03:12:12] <HeN> blackspotwiggins: the url option on it doesnt contain any domain name
[03:12:26] <caddoo> I've tried  $(myVar).find('td:last-child a') and $(myVar,'td:last-child a')
[03:12:44] <blackspotwiggins> HeN, you just said it works without www.
[03:13:19] <HeN> blackspotwiggins: right but I dont give it the page name like "url: 'page.php'"
[03:13:31] <HeN> I just give it the page name sorry
[03:13:42] <shoky> caddoo: caddoo: $(myVar).find('td:last a')
[03:14:31] <shoky> caddoo: mm i'd just do $(myVar).children('td').last().find('a')
[03:15:36] <shoky> though.. :last-child should work fine too, if myVar is just one row element
[03:15:55] <fALSO> Hi!
[03:16:06] <shoky> HELLOW
[03:16:07] <fALSO> Can anyone recommend me a jquery plugin
[03:16:23] <blackspotwiggins> sure dude, try jquery.placeholder
[03:16:34] <HeN> lol
[03:16:40] <fALSO> to do stuff like... add / remove fields from a form, when certain feilds are selected/ deselected
[03:16:44] <fALSO> and stuff like that
[03:17:02] <fALSO> does any thing like that exist, or should i do the code myself ?
[03:17:02] <shoky> a plugin.. to do.. stuff?
[03:17:05] <fALSO> :-)
[03:17:32] <blackspotwiggins> shoky, the plugin for everything my app does - surely it's out there :)
[03:17:32] <shoky> i dont think there is any plugin that does stuff, you need to code stuff yourself
[03:17:40] <shoky> ;]
[03:17:40] <fALSO> english isnt my main language, its hard for me to explain
[03:17:47] <fALSO> sorry shoky :-P
[03:17:57] <shoky> fALSO: remember that we can't read your thoughts
[03:18:03] <shoky> english or no
[03:18:07] <HeN> fALSO: check .change() and .append() on api.jquery.com
[03:19:10] <fALSO> ok, i tought that maybe something like that was already created :)
[03:19:16] <fALSO> thanks anyway
[03:19:22] <shoky> ;s
[03:19:37] <HeN> blackspotwiggins: any suggestions for my issue?
[03:19:43] <blackspotwiggins> fALSO, check http://iwantaneff.in/repo/ maybe there is something there
[03:19:50] <blackspotwiggins> HeN, not sure really
[03:20:06] <fALSO> for example, if you check a checkbox, a new field appears
[03:20:09] <fALSO> stuff like that
[03:20:14] <fALSO> ok , going to take a look
[03:20:17] <shoky> fALSO: that is basic jquery stuff
[03:20:57] <fALSO> yap, but i wanted some sort of "tags" or something like that, because they are a ton of forms, and I will have to create differente js for all of them
[03:21:08] <fALSO> but if its needed... ill have to do it
[03:21:08] <HeN> this is driving me crazy, never had such a problem
[03:21:08] <fALSO> hehe
[03:21:31] <blackspotwiggins> fALSO, as a developer you surely have the skill to generalize the problem here
[03:21:34] <shoky> fALSO: if you link to an example of something similar.. maybe someone will know a plugin to help you

[03:23:04] <spots> hi
[03:26:15] <Lindrian> http://pastebin.com/bfEHcaxN
[03:26:20] <spots> does anyone know how to align the grid for draggables to a div where there supposed to be dropped so that you can place them in the top-left corner without a gap?
[03:26:25] <Lindrian> Im trying to attach a click even to a bunch of dynamic elements
[03:26:33] <Lindrian> their ID all starts with 'try_again'
[03:26:41] <Lindrian> Whats wrong with my code?
[03:28:40] <quicksilver> Lindrian: elements which are added later after you call that?
[03:28:46] <Lindrian> yes
[03:28:51] <quicksilver> you problem is that's not how on works.
[03:28:52] <Lindrian> .live is depracted
[03:28:58] <Lindrian> oh ok
[03:29:01] <quicksilver> yes, .live is deprecated and you can replace it with on
[03:29:04] <quicksilver> but you don't do it like that.
[03:29:27] <Lindrian> How do I do it then?
[03:30:42] <Eising> hey there. In a javascript source, I'm doing two $.ajax calls, and I'm finding that it is random which one loads and returns first. How can I ensure that the second call comes after the first?
[03:30:44] <quicksilver> $(document).on("click",'[id^="try_again"]',function() {..} )
[03:30:51] <quicksilver> as explain in the docs to live and the docs to on.
[03:31:10] <Lindrian> quicksilver: damn i tried that..
[03:32:01] <quicksilver> Eising: don't fire it until the callback of the first.
[03:32:03] <Lindrian> doesnt work quicksilver.
[03:32:14] <Lindrian> added an alert() in the function, never fires.
[03:32:19] <quicksilver> jsfiddle
[03:32:59] <Eising> quicksilver: well, the callback is a function. I'm not sure I know how to make sure it doesn't fire until the callback of the first
[03:33:09] <spots> Eising: look for $.when
[03:33:44] <spots> Eising: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/ see the example
[03:34:11] <quicksilver> Eising: put the 2nd $.ajax call in that  callback function?
[03:34:26] <quicksilver> or make a new function:
[03:35:10] <quicksilver> $.ajax("first/one",{ .. callback: function() { $.ajax("second/one"....); originalcallback(); } )
[03:36:19] <Eising> spots: $.when was indeed the trick, thanks!
[03:36:30] <spots> you're welcome
[03:37:04] <Lindrian> wtf, works on jsfiddle
[03:37:35] <spots> so no jquery ui draggable 'pro' present? :(
[03:37:58] <quicksilver> Lindrian: that's because it's right :)
[03:38:03] <quicksilver> something else must be wrong on your page.
[03:39:47] <Lindrian> but what
[03:39:48] <Lindrian> :<
[03:40:39] <Lindrian> nvm, i got it
[03:40:47] <sunbeam> Hi, whats the best plugin to show images in a lightbox?
[03:43:59] <timing> I dislike all lightbox solutions
[03:44:06] <timing> all very bloated
[03:44:36] <timing> there must be a lightweight one smoewhere, but I have yet to find it (and I haven't searched for 2 month's already)
[03:45:32] <teeher> ha fuck thats long
[03:46:13] <rosieres> timing: 5KB´s gzipped enough ? -> http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox
[03:47:08] <rosieres> sunbeam: look above post
[03:48:09] <IceGuest_77> Hi all
[03:48:30] <timing> rosieres: yea we use that one now :-)
[03:48:39] <IceGuest_77> I need some help with scrolling
[03:48:41] <HeN> finally solved it, if the page has <base href="" /> defined to domain.tld and you're on www.domain.tld $.ajax wont execute
[03:48:49] <IceGuest_77> Here is the code http://pastebin.com/uzqpJhn1
[03:49:38] <IceGuest_77> I want when an item is dragged to the end of the page on mobile phone the page should scroll to show the next lists on the page
[03:51:04] <sunbeam> rosieres: thanks
[03:51:16] <bittyx-work> hi all, i'm having some buggy behavior with jqeuryui's draggable plugin, however, it's not consistent across browsers.
[03:51:34] <bittyx-work> a buggy version can be seen here: http://aik.ews.co.rs/ <--- open it in google chrome
[03:51:47] <bittyx-work> try dragging the e-banking "widget" thingy around and it works
[03:52:30] <bittyx-work> however, if you scroll the page down a bit in the browser, and try dragging it, it "jumps" away from the cursor (by what seems to be the same distance that the page is scrolled from the top)
[03:52:56] <bittyx-work> i've found out that this has something to do with overflow css styles, but i can't seem to fix this (and i don't see anything plainly "wrong" with what i'm doing)
[03:54:26] <IceGuest_77> @bittyx-work I am also stuck with similar kind of issue
[03:54:43] <IceGuest_77> Are you using the jquery ui draggable?
[03:55:20] <bittyx-work> IceGuest_77: yup
[03:55:26] <bittyx-work> IceGuest_77: it seems to be related to this: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4297
[03:55:36] <IceGuest_77> Have you set the appendTo to body
[03:55:55] <bittyx-work> IceGuest_77: yes, and nothing helps (i've tried various solutions found on the internet)
[03:56:17] <IceGuest_77> I am also trying the same thing. May be you can help.
[03:56:19] <bittyx-work> IceGuest_77: the official answer on that bug report (which is closed) is "jQuery doesn't support offset calculations when the html or body elements are modified in a way that changes the offset of the document element. "
[03:56:29] <code_ph0y> hey guys does jquery have an inject function?
[03:56:36] <IceGuest_77> I want when an item from jquery ui draggable list isdragged to the end of viewable area of phone, the page should scroll to show the next list.
[03:56:36] <IceGuest_77> [16:23] <IceGuest_77> Here is currently implemented code.
[03:56:36] <IceGuest_77> [16:23] <IceGuest_77> http://pastebin.com/uzqpJhn1
[03:56:40] <bittyx-work> but i can't figure out how overflow-y: scroll; on the body element changes the offset of the document...
[03:57:10] <bittyx-work> IceGuest_77: sorry, i haven't worked with jquery.mobile, can't help you
[03:57:15] <bittyx-work> code_ph0y: what do you mean "inject" ?
[03:57:28] <code_ph0y> like ... inject into element
[03:58:42] <code_ph0y> forexample .... div#example ..... inject .... <span>hello world</span> ..... to the innerHTML
[03:59:08] <bittyx-work> code_ph0y: check out .appendTo() and similar methods
[03:59:20] <code_ph0y> nice bud thanks
[03:59:23] <bittyx-work> code_ph0y: yw
[03:59:35] <IceGuest_77> @bittyx-work
[03:59:54] <bittyx-work> IceGuest_77: yes?
[04:00:01] <Lindrian> i have an element like this: <a href="" id="blah">stuff</a>. After this element, there's an <img class="blah2" />
[04:00:15] <IceGuest_77> Can you tell me how I can detect if mouse is moved to the end of the visible area.
[04:00:16] <Lindrian> How can I by binding an event to the anchor #blah tag find #blah2?
[04:00:28] <Lindrian> I was trying $(this).closest() etc but could not get it to work
[04:01:26] <IceGuest_77> I want to scroll page if the mouse is at the end of screen and there is some part page of which is yet not viewed by user
[04:02:06] <bittyx-work> Lindrian: http://api.jquery.com/next/
[04:02:18] <bittyx-work> IceGuest_77: don't know, sorry. gotta get back to work...
[04:02:30] <Lindrian> awesome!
[04:02:37] <IceGuest_77> ok
[04:17:51] <fatninja> I don't know if this is jquery or javascript but I'm trying to do something before user closes it's browser
[04:17:57] <fatninja> or changes the page
[04:18:19] <fatninja> I tried $(window).unload(function(){alert ("A");}); , has absolutely no effect
[04:20:50] <IceGuest_77> @fatninja Have you tried
[04:20:53] <IceGuest_77> window.onbeforeunload = WindowCloseHanlder;
[04:20:53] <IceGuest_77> function WindowCloseHanlder()
[04:20:53] <IceGuest_77> {
[04:20:53] <IceGuest_77> window.alert('My Window is reloading');
[04:20:53] <IceGuest_77> }
[04:22:12] <mc_teo> hello all
[04:22:32] <fatninja> IceGuest_77 yes, doesn't work what you pasted
[04:22:44] <mc_teo> can someone have a look at http://jsfiddle.net/7sYxZ/ and see why the animations aren't being animated?
[04:22:52] <fatninja> I want to do an ajax request, before closing
[04:23:17] <IceGuest_77> Use $.ajax in windowclosehandler
[04:24:12] <fatninja> IceGuest_77 you understand that what you pasted doesn't work
[04:24:29] <fatninja> *tried it only in Chrome
[04:26:29] <Ring0`> Hey. When adding prototype to jQuery how do I retrieve the text? Example: $('TESTING').showMe(); $.fn.showMe = function() { console.log(???) }; what to put in ??? ; this wont be this.val(); this.html() but.. ?
[04:30:19] <clu3> hello all, how do i unbind ajaxForm(options) to a form and rebind it again?  (because my options have been updated)
[04:32:28] <IceGuest_77> Use unbind().bind()
[04:32:40] <clu3> unbind('ajaxForm') ?
[04:33:43] <clu3> IceGuest_77, it doesn't work. I need to totally refresh the ajaxForm options
[04:34:13] <IceGuest_77> What basically do you want to achieve? The unbind() is to unbind a event and bind is to bind an event for example if you want to unbind previous click events
[04:34:29] <IceGuest_77> from a element you can do it as follows
[04:35:07] <IceGuest_77> $("button").unbind('click').bind('click',function(){ // do your stuff});
[04:35:33] <clu3> yep but that's an event. In this case, i want to kind of "refresh" the .ajaxForm() plugin
[04:36:25] <RawChid> w
[04:37:32] <clu3> i know, it's kinda weird case. i have callbacks for ajaxForm(), when inserting a new comment and updating comment. After each insert/update, i need to refresh that (options)
[04:38:17] <mc_teo> can someone have a look at http://jsfiddle.net/7sYxZ/ and see why the animations aren't being animated?
[04:38:19] <clu3> calling .ajaxForm(options) again doesn't work, so i need to basically refresh the whole .ajaxForm function call
[04:38:44] <IceGuest_77> If you want to rese the ajaxform on selector than you can set the ajaxform to null
[04:39:00] <IceGuest_77> $("form").ajaxform = null;
[04:39:27] <IceGuest_77> than again you can call $("form").ajaxform(options);
[04:42:00] <clu3> IceGuest_77, it doesn't seem to work somehow
[04:42:11] <clu3> the old options is still there
[04:43:40] <clu3> anyway thanks guys i'll probably need to rethink the approach
[04:43:47] <clu3> gotta go now
[05:00:05] <PlasmaBunny> hi
[05:00:17] <PlasmaBunny> are there something like .each that is like .live ?
[05:00:33] <PlasmaBunny> i.e. $('body').live('each',function(){ console.log($(this)); });
[05:01:15] <blackspotwiggins> wat?
[05:01:34] <PlasmaBunny> blackspotwiggins: so newly added elements will be eached
[05:03:03] <blackspotwiggins> why would you need that?
[05:03:11] <blackspotwiggins> and no, there is no such thing
[05:04:16] <xec_> ?xy @ PlasmaBunny
[05:04:31] * xec_ pokes bot-t
[05:05:19] <blackspotwiggins> ?botsnack
[05:05:23] <blackspotwiggins> :(
[05:05:47] <xec_> no feeding the bot when he is misbehaving! how will he learn?
[05:05:55] <bot-t> PlasmaBunny, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[05:05:56] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[05:05:58] <xec_> lol
[05:06:23] <xec_> i take that back
[05:06:29] <xec_> obviously it helps
[05:06:39] <blackspotwiggins> :)
[05:06:44] <blackspotwiggins> maye he was starving
[05:09:30] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody notice jsfiddle.net has changed? I don't know where to enable jQuery for it atm
[05:10:18] <PlasmaBunny> blackspotwiggins: obviously i need to run stuff on added content
[05:10:23] <blackspotwiggins> DeltaHeavy, the huge <select> ?
[05:10:32] <blackspotwiggins> PlasmaBunny, the run it manually
[05:10:33] <PlasmaBunny> like $(this).spawnstuff()
[05:10:36] <blackspotwiggins> you are adding it
[05:10:39] <IceGuest_77> How I can scroll page automatically when cursor is reached at the end of viewable area of screen to show the other part of the page. For example if I have a page of 3000px height and currently 1000px of the page is viewable and if user mouse is on 1000px it should scroll to show the next 1000px of the page.
[05:10:41] <blackspotwiggins> not some magic fairy
[05:10:43] <PlasmaBunny> blackspotwiggins: there are tons of places with ajax updates
[05:10:49] <blackspotwiggins> well organize your shit then
[05:10:53] <PlasmaBunny> and there are tons of stuff
[05:10:58] <PlasmaBunny> no way
[05:11:01] <xec_> lol
[05:11:18] <PlasmaBunny> blackspotwiggins: it's a brain simulation website
[05:11:19] <DeltaHeavy> blackspotwiggins: I don't see it. I don't see that side bar at all. Have you tried clearing you cache or is something messed up on my end?
[05:11:34] <DeltaHeavy> wtf, I save it NOW it shows up @_@
[05:11:37] <rahmen> Hi! I have a question regarding inserting DOM elements with jQuery. Pretty long question so read it here: http://pastebin.com/5ECCybTj Thanks!
[05:11:45] <PlasmaBunny> i.e. i must call $(this).increaseweigth() on synapse if it is created
[05:11:50] <DeltaHeavy> That site is friggen shit in some ways -_-
[05:12:07] <blackspotwiggins> DeltaHeavy, dunno, it can get weird
[05:12:08] <xec_> s/friggen/the
[05:12:29] <IceGuest_77> Can anyone help on this?
[05:12:54] <blackspotwiggins> IceGuest_77, there is mousemove event you can use
[05:12:58] <DeltaHeavy> I tested this out and to my knowledge this is INVALID code. Can somebody just verify this for me? $('.SubTotal .ProductPrice').each(function () {
[05:13:44] <xec_> DeltaHeavy: i assume this is just a fragment - if so i can't spot an error
[05:14:12] <DeltaHeavy> xec_: Does that actually do anything though? I did this test case and got no alerts http://jsfiddle.net/QPPSR/
[05:14:50] <xec_> DeltaHeavy: in that css selector, the space is the ancestor combinator
[05:15:10] <DeltaHeavy> Thought so, holy crap I'm glad the guy who coded this shit isn't here anymore lol
[05:15:21] <xec_> DeltaHeavy: meaning, you're selecting .thing2s that are ancestors of a .thing1
[05:15:43] <xec_> DeltaHeavy: maybe you wanted '.thing1, .thing2' ?
[05:16:23] <xec_> err s/ancestors/descendants
[05:16:49] <DeltaHeavy> xec_: I don't know what this guy wants lol but I'll assume it's that. Even in that case is that a valid each statement? When I use each I use it like: $.each('.thing', function(index, value() {
[05:17:21] <DeltaHeavy> Like, it runs but is it "PROPER". This crap has to work on IE7+ and I can't test it on here so I want to make sure it's not shit code I'm going to have to fix later.
[05:17:59] <blackspotwiggins> DeltaHeavy, yeah it looks fine
[05:18:05] <DeltaHeavy> Ok, thanks
[05:18:10] <xec_> DeltaHeavy: $.each() is for any generic collection while $('selector').each() is for iterating the selection
[05:18:11] <blackspotwiggins> $.each('.thing'.. should not work however
[05:18:33] <DeltaHeavy> Crap, my code was wrong :p
[05:18:41] <DeltaHeavy> $.each($('.thing'), function() {
[05:18:47] <xec_> blackspotwiggins: you would loop through the letters i think? :D
[05:18:57] <blackspotwiggins> it might
[05:19:45] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know what the point of the '[1]' is in here?   typeof $('.SubTotal td strong')[1] != "undefined"
[05:20:34] <blackspotwiggins> DeltaHeavy, that's just stupid code
[05:20:56] <xec_> returns the second native DOM element of the jquery collection
[05:21:05] <DeltaHeavy> *mind blown*
[05:21:11] <rahmen> I've read that when you want to insert a lot of elements in the DOM it's better to build a html string and insert everything than to insert them one by one. Is this true? I'm not sure which option to choose, code here: http://pastebin.com/Q4b3jAVm
[05:21:20] <xec_> but it would be easier to just check the length
[05:21:22] <seutje> heh
[05:21:25] <blackspotwiggins> yeah.. but you dont check presence like that o_O
[05:21:28] <DeltaHeavy> Last time I ever get a brother's friend who claims to be superior master programmer a job -_-.
[05:21:42] <seutje> DeltaHeavy: did you mean if ($('.SubTotal td strong').length) ?
[05:22:03] <DeltaHeavy> seutje: This is an ex co-worker's code. I have no idea what he meant lol.
[05:22:08] <blackspotwiggins> rahmen, you can use documentFragment with real dom elements
[05:22:17] <Christer_> Whats the best way of checking wether a string excists in a array ?
[05:22:26] <seutje> DeltaHeavy: well, it looks like the most awkward way possible to do the same thing :P
[05:23:02] <xec_> seutje: not quite, .length > 1 would be closer
[05:23:11] <rahmen> blackspotwiggins: Sry, not sure what documentFragment is?
[05:23:15] <DeltaHeavy> seutje: I think there's probably an even better way to do it regardless. The guy who wrote this must have shit for brains
[05:23:23] <seutje> xec_: why?
[05:23:24] <xec_> seutje: seeing as it is 0 indexed, [1] will be the second <strong> element
[05:23:25] <blackspotwiggins> rahmen, you can insert it to a dummy element and insert that once
[05:23:36] <DeltaHeavy> Always trying to help him but he's like "NO, I GOT IT GOD". So much rage inside of me right now T_T
[05:23:39] <seutje> yeah, it's detecting the absence of a second element
[05:24:08] <seutje> oh wait yeah, that's another level of awkward
[05:24:27] <xec_> but then again, guessing what the original author really wanted... maybe you're right ;)
[05:24:30] <rahmen> blackspotwiggins: ah ok, so I'll create a dummy tbody and insert row in that and then something like realtbody.append(tbodydummy.html()) ?
[05:24:38] <seutje> we'll never know :')
[05:24:42] <seutje> :'(*
[05:27:12] <shoky> rahmen: that won't preserve the .data on the elements, you could realtbody.append( tbodydummy.children() )
[05:29:12] <rahmen> shoky: Ah, ok! So this is a lot faster than doing realtbody.append($('<tr>').data('data', value).text('...')); on every element I want to add?
[05:29:44] <shoky> should be, yeah
[05:30:15] <rahmen> ah ok, cool! Thanks!
[05:32:36] <shoky> tho i'm not 100% sure about that
[05:33:15] <DeltaHeavy> Now this code is declaring a function in a loop in $(document).ready.....rage level 9001
[05:33:23] <DeltaHeavy> Going to get...violent @_@
[05:33:37] <shoky> sounds yummy
[05:33:58] <DeltaHeavy> Imma probably rewrite this...it's ridden with bugs...I wonder why -_-
[05:34:17] <DeltaHeavy> This guy also talks shit saying everybody in the office is a shit programmer and he's some godly amazing master race programmer...
[05:34:37] <DeltaHeavy> Sorry I'll stop now. IRL pissed right now
[05:34:40] <DeltaHeavy> This code hurts the soul
[05:35:11] <shoky> was he fired
[05:35:27] <DeltaHeavy> He was going to be but he quit first.
[05:36:02] <DeltaHeavy> He made a huge mistake in a MySQL query that printed out a bunch of confidential data, pushed it live without obviously testing it for more than half a second.
[05:36:13] <DeltaHeavy> Then blamed it on me
[05:36:28] <shoky> lol
[05:36:53] <shoky> nice friends your brother has
[05:36:54] <ajpiano> DeltaHeavy: is this also the same guy who was trolling you guys all over irc
[05:37:05] <DeltaHeavy> I made the MySQL query for him cause he doesn't need him and instructed him to remove the static value in the WHERE statement with the customer ID variable. He was all like "GOD I KNOW I'M NOT STUPID" and I guess he didn't hear me.
[05:37:06] <ruby_on_tails> why does jquery return the width of body(1360) when i ask for the width of a child which is almost 2k pixels wide ?
[05:37:14] <ruby_on_tails> there is a horizontal scroller coming up
[05:37:32] <ruby_on_tails> but $("#child").width() is giving me the body's max width
[05:37:35] <ruby_on_tails> or the viewport width
[05:38:12] <DeltaHeavy> ajpiano: Kreczor actually. I do not wish to comment on that other guy for the time being xD. At least that guy's a good programmer, and actually my superior. He just screws around on here when he needs a break
[05:38:27] <shoky> ruby_on_tails: is the scrollbar on that element, or on body?
[05:38:33] <ajpiano> DeltaHeavy: no way, that sucks
[05:38:40] <ruby_on_tails> i guess this is happening because the child has 100% being a block element
[05:40:07] <ruby_on_tails> shoky: made it display inline and it works
[05:40:25] <shoky> shrugs
[05:41:09] <DeltaHeavy> ajpiano: Yeah. Frig I'm glad he's gone though lol. That guy is way to stubborn to hold down any job lol
[05:49:44] * ezio just found out about ctrl shift e in chrome
[05:49:53] <ezio> NOW I'M FREEEEEEEEEEEEE
[05:50:47] <PrgmrBill> ezio: ctrl+shift+i and ctrl+shift+j do the same thing in chrome
[05:50:49] <PrgmrBill> mind blown!
[05:51:39] <jworboys> c+s+i opens element inspector c+s+j opens console
[05:51:46] <jworboys> similar, but different
[05:52:21] <xec_> the more you know! (tm)
[05:54:23] <ezio> i use f12 to get to the debugger
[05:54:28] <ezio> it works in any browser
[05:55:00] <boulet101010_> omgaaaaay ezio it's in firefox too o_O_oO_oO!
[05:55:18] <ezio> what is?
[05:56:23] <xec_> a monster with 6 eyes and 3 mouths
[05:57:57] <quicksilver> it's a sea monster
[05:58:05] <quicksilver> part of its length is under the water
[05:58:09] <quicksilver> it's coming to get xec
[06:00:53] <boulet101010_> tab groupping!§
[06:01:32] <boulet101010_> total useless for me but quite fun and fancy
[06:10:39] <PrgmrBill> jworboys: awesome! I did not know that
[06:10:40] <rahmen> Anyone who knows for sure if it's faster to append elements to elements outside the DOM-tree than inside? And what difference is it between doing that and building up a html-string and then append that?
[06:14:24] <pachet> rahmen: is this with or without jquery :[
[06:14:53] <blackspotwiggins> rahmen, didnt you already get that answer?
[06:17:24] <jworboys> Hey guys, I'm getting an error with jQuery 1.8.0 on IE8.  IE Dev tools console is giving me:  Unexpected call to method or property access.  Anyone seen this before/have any idea?
[06:18:22] <zafu> hi, how do I programmatically trigger a .change() event ?
[06:18:31] <blackspotwiggins> zafu, .change()
[06:18:43] <blackspotwiggins> or .trigger('change') if you are  not into saving bytes
[06:18:49] <seutje> mind: blown
[06:19:03] <zafu> blackspotwiggins: oki
[06:19:29] <granden_> Hi, I get the following, Uncaught exception: TypeError: '$('h3.accordion').accordion' is not a function after included jquery, a jquery plugin called collapsible and did initiate it.
[06:19:34] <granden_> Any one who have any ideas to why?
[06:20:17] <ajpiano> granden_: "is not a function" on a plugin means the plugin is almost definitely not included correctly
[06:20:26] <ajpiano> or you are calling the wrong method name
[06:20:31] <ajpiano> please debug that
[06:20:37] <granden_> ajpiano: Ok
[06:23:10] <pachet> jworboys: yes, but that's pretty unspecific, do you have more info?
[06:23:58] <jworboys> I've dug a bit deeper
[06:24:35] <jworboys> The latest non-jquery core call being made in the stcktrace is:  $(this).text(inWords(data.datetime));  from the "timeago" plguin
[06:25:15] <jworboys> which bubbles up the actual error occurring in:  (this.nodeType===1||this.nodeType===11)&&this.appendChild(a)  in the query core
[06:26:25] <rahmen> blackspotwiggins: nope I didn't, just shoky who wan't 100% sure. And also I still haven't got the answer if building a html string is faster or slower.
[06:26:57] <blackspotwiggins> every dom operation is expensive
[06:27:04] <blackspotwiggins> it's faster to do one instead of n
[06:27:11] <rahmen> pachet: yes, I'm using jQuery - we're in the jQuery channel :P is the answer different without jQuery?
[06:27:20] <pachet> jworboys: ok, almost positive it's appendChild that's causing the choke
[06:27:56] <pachet> log the element you're calling it from? sometimes IE can behave weirdly if it's a tag it's not expecting to have children
[06:29:02] <jworboys> it is being called on a "time" element, so that may be the problem
[06:29:29] <pachet> that would be the problem, yes
[06:29:55] <rahmen> blackspotwiggins: so a dummy element outside the dom tree doesn't cost much at all? Compared to building a string then? I'm not sure what I should be careful doing - but according to you it's mainly dom operations? I'm only looking for big differences in performance
[06:30:19] <blackspotwiggins> rahmen, yeah it doesnt cost
[06:30:25] <blackspotwiggins> string concat might be faster
[06:30:28] <jworboys> Do you know of any way to trick IE into using the time element?
[06:30:36] <blackspotwiggins> but its way more uncomfortable to use and maintain IMO
[06:30:49] <pachet> rahmen: in both cases, just setting the innerHTML is faster than manually appending elements
[06:30:50] <blackspotwiggins> ?g html5shiv @ jworboys
[06:30:52] <bot-t> jworboys, html5shiv - HTML5 IE enabling script - Google Project Hosting - http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/
[06:30:53] <jworboys> The plugin is calling  document.createElement("time");  before the fact
[06:31:05] <zafu> how can I write in one expression $('option[name="value1"]') OR $('option[name="value2"]') ?
[06:31:20] <rahmen> yeah I know, I've been using strings for some time now and this time I want to add data with the jquery data() function so I really need elements here :)
[06:31:26] <pachet> rahmen: and yes, using jquery for dom manip always introduces a bit of overhead
[06:31:29] <jworboys> I'll drop it in and see if it does the trick. thanks
[06:31:30] <pachet> the cost of abstraction
[06:31:38] <blackspotwiggins> pachet, not that much
[06:31:45] <pachet> 'a bit'
[06:31:49] <blackspotwiggins> the slow part is dom itself anyway
[06:34:32] <kwspeedy> could someone guide me in the right direction?
[06:34:43] <kwspeedy> $(document).ready(function(){
[06:34:43] <kwspeedy> 	
[06:34:45] <kwspeedy> 	$("#home").on('pageinit', function(){
[06:34:46] <kwspeedy> 		var homepage = $('#home img').fadeOut().fadeIn();
[06:34:48] <kwspeedy> 			console.log(homepage);	
[06:34:49] <kwspeedy> 	});
[06:34:50] <kwspeedy> 	
[06:34:51] <kwspeedy> });
[06:34:52] <kwspeedy> this won't run
[06:34:57] <seutje> ghaaaaaaaarrrrhg
[06:35:01] <jworboys> Awesome. That's fixed that one, now to debug the next lot ;) thanks pachet blackspotwiggins
[06:35:03] <seutje> Y U NO PASTIE?
[06:35:07] <kwspeedy> oops
[06:35:25] <LordThumper> zafu
[06:35:27] <kwspeedy> sorry
[06:35:43] <LordThumper> $("option[name='value1'], option[name='value2]")
[06:35:47] <zafu> thanks
[06:35:59] <blackspotwiggins> kwspeedy, do you trigger pageinit event?
[06:36:24] <kwspeedy> doh!
[06:36:32] <RawChid> Hello, I'm using jqTransform to style a <select. It works fine but now I want more <SELECT>-like functionality like UP and DOWN keys and selecting an option by typing a char (and select the option which begins with that character). Any ideas on this?
[06:36:36] <kwspeedy> nope. that would explain it.
[06:36:37] <kwspeedy> lol
[06:36:52] <blackspotwiggins> everything works better if turned on
[06:36:57] <RawChid> I tried this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9662928/to-access-jqtransform-select-using-keyboard   But then the whole website scrolls down/up as well when I use arrow keys
[06:37:53] <RawChid> Pointers are also welcome
[06:38:34] <x1337807x> I can't seem to bind an event to an html <object> element (flash movie). I'm pretty sure I've been able to bind events to <object> before, am I mistaken? I'm simply trying to add a mouseleave to it: $('object').mouseleave(function(){})
[06:39:14] <RawChid> Oh wait, arrow keys are not working at all :(
[06:39:15] <x1337807x> It just doesn't take; $('object').data('events') then returns undefined
[06:40:17] <eregi> hi! I have html that looks like this - http://pastebin.com/PE0UeJyE I would like to know what should I add to this JS in order to find all input fields in result-x, if I can get the result-x as an object.?
[06:40:46] <eregi> Js looks like this - http://pastebin.com/bsVfkZq3
[06:41:10] <Jon47> eregi: you could try serialize
[06:41:23] <Jon47> ?serialize
[06:41:25] <bot-t> .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[06:41:55] <eregi> Jon47 I need it in the form of name=>value..
[06:42:53] <eregi> Jon47, ok, looks like this will work
[06:44:17] <Jon47> serialize will just give you a string
[06:44:55] <Jon47> but you can use that string as the data in a post request, don't need to have an object literal
[06:45:51] <pachet> blackspotwiggins: i work better if i'm turned on
[06:45:56] * pachet hides behind today's paper
[06:46:19] <blackspotwiggins> w-w-wink
[06:50:13] <x1337807x> Anybody know why the DOM element <object> won't bind events?
[06:50:35] <x1337807x> Is this just something that isn't done?
[06:51:06] <eregi> Jon47, can you give an example please? http://pastebin.com/9vtp08pj gives an empty string..
[06:53:51] <Jon47> eregi:  read the docs bro, it's pretty easy
[07:02:57] <x1337807x> Why can't I bind a mouseenter event to this <object>? http://jsfiddle.net/YJDmn/
[07:06:24] <cebor> Hi, i have 4 childs in a <div>, when i change the css of one of these, is there a way that the 3 others get change thier css to something other automaticly?
[07:06:52] <cebor> or can i select these 3 others, always when i change one of the 4 ??
[07:07:17] <cebor> sry bad english ...

[07:11:21] <cebor> ty
[07:11:33] <seutje> arbitrary css changes are hard (if not impossible) to detect in a reliable, cross-browser way, so I'm assuming you're already using jQuery to do these changes
[07:16:58] <dr0id> hi, jquery no work, y?
[07:17:19] <blackspotwiggins> how is babby formed
[07:17:22] <eregi> I have created JSON array, but I don't know why php doesn't find it as $_POST data, is it because of wrong formatting? http://pastebin.com/Rp0aAKft
[07:17:42] <blackspotwiggins> eregi, ask ##php
[07:18:31] <eregi> blackspotwiggins, this is a jquery/php question, so I wanted to know if that json array is being formatted correctly.
[07:18:49] <blackspotwiggins> btw you cant do cross-site ajax
[07:20:29] <eregi> blackspotwiggins, cross site ajax?
[07:21:40] <FiSHNUGGET> I am having a very strange problem I was hoping someone could help me shed some light on.  I am working on a site that has a "dashboard" type interface.  It consists of several buttons that cause a popup to appear that is then populated with data made from an ajax post.  It works just fine in nearly every case, but on occasion the request will be sent out, but it never looks for anything to return.  It is an almost
[07:21:40] <FiSHNUGGET> instant action.  Rather than waiting for a response, and then timing out, it immediately returns a blank response.  Does anyone know what could cause this?
[07:22:24] <NodeX> A 502 / 404 from your server?
[07:22:41] <NodeX> check the net panel in firebug to see what's returned
[07:22:48] <FiSHNUGGET> nope..  always a 200.
[07:23:19] <FiSHNUGGET> I can't tell if it's a jquery issue or a server issue
[07:23:44] <FiSHNUGGET> I have noticed…  that if the window stays open for a long period of time with no activity, it SEEMS to happen more often.
[07:24:06] <FiSHNUGGET> in multiple browsers though
[07:25:23] <NodeX> what does the response have in it?
[07:25:56] <seutje> FiSHNUGGET: inspect the request and see if it contains what it should, and inspect what's coming in on the server-side, if you can
[07:26:01] <FiSHNUGGET> the headers look correct, but there's nothing in the response body.  Not even any kind of error, or anything.  Just completely blank.
[07:26:25] <FiSHNUGGET> ye…  let me check the access logs
[07:26:50] <FiSHNUGGET> big problem is that I can't recreate it on demand
[07:26:55] <seutje> if those both contain what you'd expect, I'm inclined to think it's a server-side issue
[07:27:00] <seutje> yeah, love those :(
[07:27:18] <FiSHNUGGET> so annoying..  hard to replicate bugs are the worst
[07:29:29] <x1337807x> Should anyone happen upon that problem in the future, with jQuery you must wrap an object in a div and bind events to the div element.
[07:29:45] <NexHD> hi
[07:29:47] <x1337807x> in javascript events can be bound directly to <object>, but not in jQuery
[07:30:17] <ajpiano> x1337807x: is your <object> a flash element
[07:30:27] <NexHD> i want to ask  whats do the init:function() ?
[07:30:44] <x1337807x> ajpiano: Yes, but not in the jsfiddle demonstrating the bug
[07:31:01] <davatron5000> Is .closest() totally deprecated? What does "signature" refer to here: http://api.jquery.com/closest/#closest2 ?
[07:31:14] <ajpiano> x1337807x: well, the jsfiddle illustrating the bug, isn't a bug :p
[07:32:01] <ajpiano> davatron5000: no, the closest( Array ) signature is deprecated
[07:32:33] <x1337807x> ajpiano: If your point is that it's intentional it would be helpful if you could explain why.
[07:32:40] <ajpiano> x1337807x: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/data.js#L16-23
[07:32:43] <ajpiano> sorry was getting the link
[07:33:50] <davatron5000> ajpiano: Hm. I guess I don't understand the word signature in this context. So you can't pass $(this).closest( [ 'a' ,'p' ] ) or something?  Or even $(this).closest('a, p') ?
[07:34:04] <x1337807x> ajpiano: So theoretically the flash object my script embeds should allow events to be bound?
[07:34:09] <ajpiano> x1337807x: yes
[07:34:21] <ajpiano> if you are having trouble binding events to an object that *is* flash, that might be a bug
[07:34:32] <ajpiano> but plain old $("<object>").click(fn) is known to not work
[07:34:53] <ajpiano> davatron5000: .closest( Array ) is a different signature than .closest( String )
[07:35:48] <x1337807x> ajpiano: It's not obvious to me how jQuery detects that a given object is a flash object? My flash object doesn't allow event bindings so it clearly isn't being setup correctly.
[07:36:24] <ajpiano> x1337807x: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/data.js#L209-215 is how
[07:36:32] <davatron5000> ajpiano: Ok. Sweet. Thanks a bunch! Smooches!
[07:36:38] <ajpiano> it checks the element's classid attribute and sees if it matche that classid that is supposedly flash
[07:36:42] <ajpiano> davatron5000: <3zzzzz
[07:39:22] <subanomic> hi
[07:39:36] <spots> how can set the offset of the grid for draggables in jquery ui?

[07:39:56] <kwspeedy> what am I doing wrong? http://pastebin.com/gaqLveBe
[07:40:22] <subanomic> the elements that fade out and fade in, respectively, are both elements of an <ul>
[07:42:38] <kwspeedy> both are inside anchor tags
[07:43:19] <kwspeedy> the code will work it i take away $('#home').on('pageinit', function(event){});

[07:53:36] <timwis> Hey guys, I'd like to find an ID number inside a <textarea> and print it elsewhere on the page. I know the text before the ID number, so I can do a .replace(/[?:Desired ID: ](\d{5})/, 'blah blah $1 blah') but I don't want to replace it in the <textarea> - I want to use the $1 below the textarea (so I can use it to create an <a>). Is there another regex function that gives backreferences like that?

[08:35:50] <lotus> is there a way to remove !important with jquery?  It's being forced on my page via an external javascript file which loads an external css file
[08:39:39] <supsup> just be more specific with your css than the important rule
[08:42:19] <Jon47> does the ! have any special meaning in a sizzle selector?  I've got some insane legacy script that is creating elements with class names like "env_Yahoo!" and when I try to select them in jquery i get some kind of error
[08:43:02] <cebor> is there a way to get the number of a child ???
[08:43:20] <silverwind> Ask your wife for their birth certificates.
[08:43:27] <supsup> that sounds pedobearish.
[08:43:27] <dabear_> Jon47: If you wish to use any of the meta-characters ( such as !"#$%&'()*+,./:;<=>?@[\]^`{|}~ ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: \\.
[08:43:47] <Jon47> dabear_: gotcha, thanks!
[08:44:20] <dabear_> cebor: yes, but what kinda number do you want, and on what element?
[08:44:30] <cebor> the nth number
[08:44:41] <supsup> heh
[08:44:43] <pachet> ?.index() @ cebor

[08:46:36] <squeakytoy> I have a very annoying problem. When I mouse over the box, my "sub-box" loses focus, even though my box is "ifront" of the "sub-box", in Internet Explorer. How the heck can i solve this? http://jsfiddle.net/YveFX/6/
[08:47:29] <smart1> hi theer
[08:47:31] <smart1> there
[08:48:15] <pachet> hi
[08:48:33] <cebor> http://pastebin.com/2Nfhcrfc    this is the code for a simple slideshow, i want my code from line 22 a little bit more smart
[08:48:46] <cebor> in cause, when i have more then 4 elements
[08:48:58] <squeakytoy> i will rephrase my question:
[08:49:00] <squeakytoy> I have a very annoying problem. When I mouse over my above-box, the sub-box appears with text. However, in Internet Explorer when i mouse over the text of sub-box, it fades out. How it this possible, when my above-box is "above" the sub-box.
[08:49:30] <smart1> atm i call find().each()... now i want go get access to the innerhtml of the child with the name "name". but i ge an error each time: c.innerHtml is undefined. i will paste in a min
[08:50:45] <supsup> squeakytoy:  not sure if this is what u want: http://jsfiddle.net/YveFX/8/
[08:51:22] <BillCriswell> smart1: Is this what you need? find().each(function(i){ var $this = $(this); var nam = $this.find('[name=name]').eq(0).html(); });
[08:51:38] <squeakytoy> supsup, you moved it in as a child?
[08:51:52] <supsup> assume thats what you intended
[08:52:21] <smart1> @BillCriswell i'll give a try. here's my paste http://pastebin.com/rC45mLYT
[08:52:38] <squeakytoy> supsup, i will try and see
[08:53:46] <hateIE> hey can some one help me out im using $("ul#slides").cycle() to try and do a slide show.. no problem with chrome but in IE scumming 8 when I hover on the image its changing a css which makes it move on the screen .. if i paste the code to jsfiddle can some one look over it for me .. not sure if its something going on inside jquery itself as i cant find any thing to suggest it would mess with
[08:53:46] <hateIE> the margin/padding/top of the image
[08:54:35] <AngryAsian> put it on jsfiddle I'm sure someone will stare at it. :)
[08:55:11] <hateIE> ok then... is any one else absolutely sick to death of having to run around after internet explorers god damn junk behavior
[08:55:32] <supsup> not me i love it.
[08:55:46] <BillCriswell> hateIE: Keeps me limber!
[08:56:10] <AngryAsian> lies, all lies
[08:56:19] <hateIE> I cant stand it .. and the notion that you must code it around internet explorer first and then treat the other browsers as the quirk makes me sick
[08:56:37] <AngryAsian> you cant like IE. IE9 cant apply padding to an input element.
[08:56:41] <BillCriswell> hateIE: I think you're approaching that backwards.
[08:56:56] <smart1> @BillCriswell http://pastebin.com/index/rC45mLYT no, it's more like my code. but jQuery throws the error at the end of my paste :(
[08:56:58] <AngryAsian> yeah code in chrome, spend 2hours fixing everything for ie in the end
[08:57:01] <pachet> i like ie10
[08:57:02] <pachet> its cute
[08:57:04] <supsup> sounds like your in the wrong bizzz bro sounds like you should be a dark jedi instead

[08:59:49] <BillCriswell> smart1: A live example would help a lot more. Looking at this code is a good start but there's more than can go wrong.
[09:00:24] <AngryAsian> ok sure, second
[09:00:54] <AngryAsian> http://ferociouscoder.com/projects/boyculture/header.html
[09:00:55] <AngryAsian> that
[09:00:59] <AngryAsian> try that in IE
[09:01:07] <BillCriswell> AngryAsian: I was talking to smart1 haha.
[09:01:15] <AngryAsian> LOL
[09:01:16] <AngryAsian> ok
[09:01:23] <AngryAsian> :P I was hoping you were about to save me some time.
[09:02:06] <smart1> that is my live example.
[09:02:19] <smart1> i just deleted the url to my xml code at the top
[09:02:49] <smart1> and that'S all code i write until now ^^
[09:04:22] <supsup> smart break it down into smaller bites, like, use console.log right and first console.log out the variable "xml" -- is it what you expect?  if it is, then do your find,  does the find return what you expwect?  if it does then do the .each...etc
[09:04:23] <pachet> AngryAsian: what's the issue with this? or did i miss where you said that
[09:04:35] <AngryAsian> Type in the search box
[09:04:42] <AngryAsian> text will go UNDER the magnifying glass
[09:05:30] <AngryAsian> IE doesnt seem to like input elements having padding. And noneof the workarounds I found seemed to work, I'm going to have to redo that little search thing.
[09:05:46] <AngryAsian> I need it working IE8 and above.
[09:06:31] <supsup> whats wrong with the box anyway besides the text not showingup
[09:07:05] <BillCriswell> AngryAsian: I think the same thing happens on Chrome but since it's a search input it only seems like the padding is working.
[09:07:05] <pachet> AngryAsian: oh i see
[09:07:16] <AngryAsian> Placeholder doesnt show up, text goes under the magnifying glass. Thats about it.
[09:07:43] <AngryAsian> BillCriswell: Really? Thats an interesting thought.
[09:07:50] <hateIE> http://jsfiddle.net/q4nb7/1/
[09:08:49] <hateIE> sorry my inet is not very stable today
[09:09:28] <supsup> so your telling me you want to get ride of this sweet feature image movement?
[09:09:47] <BillCriswell> AngryAsian: http://jsfiddle.net/CEAfF/
[09:10:01] <hateIE> i think the idea of it is to stop the transistioning but on IE it makes the whole image jump down
[09:10:39] <AngryAsian> That padding totally works for me Bill :o
[09:10:49] <smart1> my intention wasn't to write a big logger for 10 lines of code -.-
[09:12:44] <hateIE> well its obviously really its a blatant IE quirk in the cycle plugin ?
[09:13:15] <hateIE> that quirk being a css related thing
[09:13:17] <AngryAsian> BillCriswell: the funny thing is, that it gives the illusion that padding is working in IE until you actually go past 20px on the right.
[09:14:32] <sunbeam> what do you guys consider the best lightbox a like plugin?
[09:14:51] <sunbeam> just the standard lightbox?
[09:15:57] <hateIE> I wish those hackers in the late 90s had of melted all of microsoft development machines or even better still if a high court judge would put an injunction on them untill the learn to follow standards instead of making up there own random ones all the time
[09:16:03] <totimkopf> hey guys, I'm having difficulties getting $().submit to work here, mind taking a look, please? http://pastebin.com/PLwDzmDv
[09:17:00] <supsup> sunbean jqueryui: dialog
[09:18:30] <BillCriswell> hateIE: What's the issue with cycle?
[09:19:01] <hateIE> its designed to stop the transistions when you hover on the li (i think)
[09:19:13] <hateIE> but in IE it causes the posistion of it to change
[09:19:20] <AngryAsian> totimkopf: you arent actually returning ANYTHING in the submit. if you want to fix it i think all you need to do is change line 6 to "return preventDupes(function(data) {"
[09:19:48] <hateIE> look at the fiddle i pasted in IE
[09:19:54] <smart1> i found a title tag in the tool-portrait but still the same error
[09:20:10] <hateIE> bigkevmcd im using ie8 here
[09:20:15] <hateIE> BillCriswell^
[09:20:22] <AngryAsian> totimkopf: also if you used jsfiddle I could have tested it, but I'm lazy.
[09:20:33] <BillCriswell> hateIE: I don't have IE to look at right now. =(
[09:20:47] <BillCriswell> However, what happens if you try adding #slideshow img { display: block; }
[09:21:12] <hateIE> i know 9 will most probably be wide spread soon so maybe i should just not care but its really annoyed me
[09:21:18] <hateIE> ill try it out ;>
[09:22:01] <BillCriswell> hateIE: Also, make sure there's no weird borders or anything.
[09:22:40] <BillCriswell> totimkopf: You're calling callback(data) but there's no callback function.
[09:24:00] <smart1> @BillCriswell sorry, i got no webspace to share for executing.
[09:24:06] <oal> I'm running a $.getJSON, and I want to open a new tab when the response comes back. Now Chrome treats window.open as a popup, and creates a small self contained window. How can I change that?
[09:24:25] <hateIE> BillCriswell: i pritty sure its all good in that department i went round on every related element and set the padding/margins to 0px every where i could
[09:24:50] <BillCriswell> hateIE: Check border, too. display: block; also saved me many headaches.
[09:24:54] <BillCriswell> Lunch time.
[09:30:06] <hateIE> BillCriswell it already has display:block
[09:30:10] <supsup> hateIE its your fadein
[09:30:19] <hateIE> !!?>
[09:31:27] <supsup> http://jsfiddle.net/q4nb7/6/  -- took out all the extra js
[09:31:43] <supsup> also note
[09:31:47] <supsup> ur not suppose to have body
[09:31:51] <supsup> in jsfiddle
[09:32:00] <supsup> and i added your script as a managed resource
[09:32:15] <spots> anyone good at jquery ui draggables?
[09:32:20] <supsup> also, your margin: 0 0px 0 0 etc...is wrong
[09:32:23] <supsup> with 0 you never use px
[09:32:25] <supsup> for css
[09:32:32] <supsup> and just margin: 0; is better
[09:32:52] <supsup> same with padding
[09:32:58] <supsup> did not fix that tho
[09:33:03] <AngryAsian> it should still work though. so what exactly is the problem hateIE. I've not been reading.
[09:33:08] <nFFF> why can you not use 0px?
[09:33:15] <nFFF> is there a bug or something?
[09:33:16] <supsup> it's bad form
[09:33:19] <hateIE> ok supsup you are a ledgend man
[09:33:20] <supsup> css nazi's grumble
[09:33:44] <AngryAsian> spots: whatcha need?
[09:33:46] <supsup> why would u do? padding: 0 0 0px 0;  and not just.... padding:0
[09:34:02] <hateIE> yeah you know why thought
[09:34:04] <nFFF> supsup, well you wouldn't
[09:34:07] <AngryAsian> but yeah its good practice to juts do padding 0 instead of list everything. and I dont use px with 0's either.
[09:34:10] <hateIE> it where there was actually a valid value in px
[09:34:15] <hateIE> i removed it for debuging
[09:34:24] <hateIE> never removed the px
[09:34:29] <supsup> the reason is was breaking was not because of cycle at all
[09:34:34] <supsup> it was that hover action you had
[09:34:35] <nFFF> but I never hated on anyone for putting px after 0
[09:34:40] <supsup> why you have hover action unsure
[09:34:45] <supsup> I do
[09:34:49] <supsup> i hate on em all the time
[09:34:50] <nFFF> I jsut never heard anyone mention it before thats all
[09:34:52] <empirically> Thoughts on the best intro tutorial? I'm writing a blog post of resources and I wanted to include some of the better links.
[09:34:54] <supsup> i'm like wtf why dis px here.
[09:34:57] <supsup> why why why
[09:34:59] <AngryAsian> probably to stop it from cycling on hover I'd guess.
[09:35:00] <nFFF> thats real css nerd shit
[09:35:31] <supsup> cycle has that built in i thought
[09:35:32] <hateIE> supsup i never even realized it had that hover action .. i was thinking it was a default behavior
[09:35:43] <AngryAsian> Never used the plugin, I'm just guessing.
[09:35:46] <hateIE> i thought the script was impervious lol
[09:35:48] <supsup> same lols
[09:35:52] <AngryAsian> or the cycle() method rather
[09:36:34] <supsup> about to roll to lunch, anyway in future make your js fiddles liek that
[09:36:50] <hateIE> hate for ie fading .. rising.... fadding rising... no fadding ::::::::::)
[09:39:15] <hateIE> thanks a bundle supsup
[09:39:23] <smart1> http://pastebin.com/L5Dteeey atm i try to log my objects, but still got the same c.innerHtml error. could not host for you, but this will run without some more code. the important thin is to geht the title tag and the innerhtml of it and print it.
[09:39:29] <supsup> yah np lunch time
[09:39:42] <AngryAsian> well its innerHTML not innerHtml. Now let me click on that link
[09:45:27] <spots> how can i adjust the grid position of a draggable?
[09:45:50] <hateIE> hoho irc client makes for a good anti idle on this choppy bt wifi service
[09:48:22] <smart1> @AngryAsian did you find something or wasn't that msg for me ^^
[09:48:29] <totimkopf> AngryAsian, http://jsfiddle.net/AFSrG/6/ you'll need to login to use it, superburritoz pw:weed8man
[09:49:06] <totimkopf> the issue is the $().submit isn't returning false
[09:49:07] <AngryAsian> smart1: I'm tryign to figure yours out. :)
[09:49:41] <AngryAsian> well you have an anonymous function in there, so that's the real issue I think.
[09:49:59] <totimkopf> AngryAsian, who is that directed to?
[09:50:08] <AngryAsian> totimkopf: its like doing $.submit(function() { false; }); not "return false;" is what I am thinking
[09:50:19] <totimkopf> ahh
[09:50:20] <mister_m> is there a way I can retrive the anonymous function that I supplied as a click handler?
[09:51:33] <totimkopf> I will try 'false' and not 'return false' but that does not make much sense to me, but then again I'm not a js guru ^^
[09:51:47] <AngryAsian> nonono
[09:53:24] <Norm> i've got a routine that filters/updates DOM elements after the page is loaded. is there a hook i can use to run this routine against newly created elements later on?
[09:53:32] <totimkopf> AngryAsian, no? :) what did you mean then?
[09:53:48] <Norm> i know i could just re-run it as part of a click handler that adds elements, but i'm hoping there's a better way to receive notification of DOM updates
[09:55:10] <AngryAsian> totimkopf name me some brands that already exist in your db
[09:55:12] <AngryAsian> so i can test
[09:55:41] <totimkopf> Brand: Marlboro, Variety: Lights, Type: Regular
[09:55:56] <totimkopf> all this talk of cigarettes is making me want one :p
[10:00:07] <smart1> anyone else an idea to solve my issue?
[10:04:00] <AngryAsian> smart1: http://jsfiddle.net/ErwNf/1/ check this
[10:04:08] <AngryAsian> i think its just your .html() thats wrong.
[10:05:54] <smart1> i know the error is because this have to be correct by the syntax and semantics of jquery
[10:06:09] <smart1> title is a tag so i have to use innerhtml ?
[10:06:14] <smart1> or is it because i use xml :(
[10:06:23] <skcin7> Stupid question. Is (function() and $(function() the same?
[10:06:37] <totimkopf> smart1, you're too smart to need help with jquery :p let him help me! :D
[10:06:58] <smart1> what's your problem ^^
[10:07:09] <totimkopf> smart1, I'm just joking :)
[10:07:27] <smart1> :D
[10:07:40] <smart1> i like my name because the most people hate it :D
[10:07:41] <ajpiano> smart1: if you want to parse an xml string into a document please use see ?jQuery.parseXML
[10:07:42] <bot-t> smart1, jQuery.parseXML(data): Parses a string into an XML document. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[10:08:05] <AngryAsian> totimkopf: im still working on your thing.. lol
[10:08:17] <totimkopf> AngryAsian, thanks :) I much appreciate your help
[10:08:45] <skcin7> Are (function(){ /* some code */ }); (without the $ symbol) and $(function(){ /* some code */ }); (with the $ symbol) the same?
[10:09:15] <ajpiano> no
[10:09:20] <ajpiano> the former is jsut a function, inside of parens
[10:09:27] <ajpiano> the latter is an alias for $(document).ready(fn);
[10:10:06] <smart1> @all thx for the help, now i got my problem and know how to fix it
[10:10:10] <lrvick> Does anyone know a way to 'pop' items off of an element group
[10:10:20] <lrvick> so that the origional element group no longer contains those items?
[10:11:02] <smart1> remove("selector")
[10:11:33] <smart1> @lrvick what's a group for you?
[10:12:05] <spots> is there noone able to help me? i need this real bad :/
[10:12:58] <smart1> @spots some more information pls
[10:13:23] <spots> i need to align/offset the grid for a draggable
[10:13:39] <lrvick> so like if I match $('#parent ul li') I would like to be able to use it as a kind of queue, in which I can say take the first 4 items from the begenning of the selection, do something with them, then grab the next 4, etc until none are left
[10:13:58] <lrvick> the equivilant of .pop() if it were an array
[10:14:05] <ajpiano> lrvick: you can use .slice() directly on a jquery object
[10:14:07] <spots> i have a div as a droppable and i need to be able to drop it do xy 0,0 of that div
[10:14:18] <ajpiano> and you can also get the underlying array
[10:14:23] <lrvick> ajpiano: but slice does not modify the origional object, right?
[10:14:25] <ajpiano> of a jquery object, by calling $(".foo").get()
[10:14:33] <ajpiano> lrvick: correct
[10:14:44] <ajpiano> there's no way to modify the original object unless you actually do another assignment
[10:14:47] <spots> it can't be that i'm the only one who needs this
[10:14:50] <lrvick> I need one that, like .pop() will modify the origional object
[10:14:53] <lrvick> hmm
[10:14:58] <superc> hi. is there some free tool available that generates a jquery website like this: http://www.edgit.de ?
[10:17:09] <superc> or this: https://squareup.com/register ? ... the design looks very common. I guess those people don't start from scratch?
[10:18:39] <smart1> cya
[10:19:11] <jedimind_> superc, you  mean the design of it ?
[10:19:32] <jedimind_> go look at twitter bootstrap
[10:19:37] <jedimind_> or foundation
[10:19:51] <jedimind_> http://foundation.zurb.com/
[10:19:58] <jedimind_> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/
[10:21:36] <superc> this looks good. I have been searching the whole www ...
[10:21:41] <superc> thanks
[10:22:53] <Pyto_Spencer> Anybody be able to offer me their assistance?
[10:23:08] <totimkopf> haha
[10:23:15] <totimkopf> angryasian ran off
[10:23:24] <totimkopf> good ol' jslint is helping me debug
[10:23:28] * totimkopf loves jslint
[10:24:30] <sunbeam> what do you guys consider the best lightbox a like plugin?
[10:24:31] <sunbeam> just the standard lightbox?
[10:29:09] <totimkopf> angryasian, oh there you are
[10:29:22] <totimkopf> angryasian, http://jsfiddle.net/AFSrG/12/ I cleaned up some jslint errors but I'm still having issues :)
[10:29:41] <angryasian> Yeah, internets bad.
[10:30:00] <totimkopf> angryasian, you need to get a new interwebs
[10:31:10] <angryasian> heh, indeed.
[10:32:13] <angryasian> Well if I remove all the javascript except for the submit and add another return false. (http://jsfiddle.net/AFSrG/13/) then I think you can just fix your problem yourself? But I'll still continue to try and fix things.
[10:33:55] <Kaseano> hi :) I was wondering, I have this situation a lot http://pastie.org/4611568 is it ok to use option A ? I know remove does a lot of stuff like unbinding events
[10:34:08] <Kaseano> option A makes my code a little cleaner in some situations though
[10:34:13] <Kaseano> I haven't profiled the two yet either
[10:35:14] <angryasian> totimkopf: your validation plugin might be accidentally submitting the page perhaps?
[10:37:26] <Kaseano> oh actually this blog says use ".empty()"
[10:37:58] <Kaseano> which takes care of events and cached data
[10:40:46] <totimkopf> angryasian, ah you think the validation code is conflicting some how?
[10:41:13] <angryasian> totimmkopf: well if you remove the validation code. the form doesnt submit. (with my extra return false;)
[10:41:37] <angryasian> also did i add a return to your function? I hope I did.
[10:42:07] <angryasian> totimkopf: there are 2 things you need to do a) do return preventDupes(stuff). not just preventDupes(stuff)
[10:42:49] <angryasian> b) double check the validation stuff. because removing it makes the submit thing actually work.
[10:43:00] <totimkopf> angryasian, it actually won't submit regardless...
[10:43:12] <angryasian> totimkopf: can you double check if this works on your end? http://jsfiddle.net/AFSrG/14/
[10:43:40] <angryasian> maybe its messing up because we dont have a .validate() command in jquery / jsfiddle
[10:43:57] <angryasian> that must be it.
[10:45:02] <angryasian> k let me try again
[10:45:03] <totimkopf> angryasian, nope, it's not submitting at all, even with made-up brands that you know won't exist :D
[10:45:24] <angryasian> haha
[10:45:58] <totimkopf> I think it's the extra return false in the callback, but that shouldn't matter... one of those should return before the last return false...
[10:47:26] <angryasian> well I think lets get rid of the fact that your preventDupes is a callback function
[10:47:31] <angryasian> and just sort of merge them together
[10:49:06] <totimkopf> angryasian, but don't I need callbacks to grab data asynchronously?
[10:49:48] <angryasian> no the $.post does that. or generally $.ajax does that
[10:49:59] <angryasian> you're like using a callback function on a callback function
[10:50:08] <totimkopf> angryasian, ah, I see
[10:50:37] <supsup> totimkopf your jsfiddle just returns false on submit
[10:52:37] <ogk1000> anyone use node.js ?
[10:52:48] <angryasian> I'm merging his two functions together. that should fix things.
[10:53:07] <supsup> ogk1000 you can join #node.js
[10:53:46] <ogk1000> tnx
[10:54:17] <angryasian> totimkopf: also I usually bind an event on the submit button itself. and then submit based on that
[10:54:23] <angryasian> if this doesnt work, we try that
[10:54:44] <totimkopf> angryasian, ok
[10:55:15] <sunbeam> when i have a img
[10:55:20] <sunbeam> <a><img>
[10:55:25] <sunbeam> and <a> is $(this)
[10:55:31] <sunbeam> how do I access <img>
[10:56:30] <shoky> sunbeam: any of:  .find('img')  .children('img')   .children()
[10:58:02] <sunbeam> ok thanks shoky
[10:58:37] <supsup> sunbeam: u could also inefficently call it's parent then that parents child and do the same commands.
[10:59:13] <angryasian> totimkopf: try something ilke this http://jsfiddle.net/AFSrG/16/
[10:59:24] <shoky> huh. you could also do while(true) { } ..
[11:00:32] <supsup> i use while(true) a lot with a return inside, cause i can.
[11:01:21] <GowGuy> Does jQuery.each randomly select its elements?
[11:01:31] <shoky> no?
[11:01:51] <supsup> it goes based on index() i think.
[11:01:54] <GowGuy> Is that a no or no i dont know
[11:02:07] <shoky> it goes based on for (o in obj)
[11:02:22] <shoky> GowGuy: it's a no
[11:02:27] <GowGuy> Hm.. alright.
[11:02:30] <ajpiano> GowGuy: define what you mean by "randomly selecting its elements"
[11:03:06] <ajpiano> sounds like you are experiencing a particular specific issue and trying to explain it away with voodoo :p
[11:03:26] <totimkopf> angryasian, getting a lot of jslint errors for revision 16
[11:03:33] <GowGuy> ajpiano haha kinda, but I thought I could save myself sometime if the answer to that question was yes
[11:03:41] <angryasian> totimkopf: well let me see
[11:03:44] <ajpiano> but you *knew* the answer to ath question was no :)
[11:04:00] <GowGuy> ajpiano haha ya I guess I did.
[11:04:40] <angryasian> totimkopf: cause I forgot the ":" after data
[11:04:44] <angryasian> totimkopf: http://jsfiddle.net/AFSrG/17/
[11:04:51] <GowGuy> Ima put together a fiddle I guess.
[11:05:49] <angryasian> totimkopf: and I'm pretty sure we're goign to have to do it on butotn click instead of submit(). cause since we're using ajax. we need to submit when we get the result. normal javascript will just pass through the function like nothing.
[11:07:06] <angryasian> totimkopf: so right now, it'll NEVER submit the form regardless of whatever we did. unless in the $.ajax perhaps we do $("#form22").submit() instead of return true; but I'm pretty sure thats just an infinite loop.
[11:09:10] <angryasian> totimkopf: this should work with 99% certainty http://jsfiddle.net/AFSrG/18/
[11:14:19] <Gates> I have 3 columns with text objects in each of them. The content is based off a certain filter with each column being a "type", I would like to have the ability to press a button and have the objects jump from column to column into a new sort, a lot like jquery quicksand. Yet I cannot see how I can achieve this with quicksand. Any ideas?
[11:15:34] <sunbeam> supsup: ok
[11:15:38] <sunbeam> how do I can the direct parent?
[11:15:40] <sunbeam> eh.
[11:15:43] <sunbeam> <li><a>
[11:15:47] <sunbeam> and <a> is $(this)
[11:15:49] <supsup> sorry was a joke
[11:15:51] <Gates> Is that easy to do?
[11:15:53] <sunbeam> lol
[11:15:59] <supsup> $(this).parent().find('a')
[11:16:09] <sunbeam> i just need the parent li class
[11:16:09] <supsup> or if ahs id
[11:16:21] <supsup> Gates Check out jqueryui Sortable
[11:16:25] <sunbeam> $(this).parent().class?
[11:16:43] <supsup> http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[11:17:08] <sunbeam> supsup: $(this).parent().attr('class') ?
[11:17:12] <supsup> sunbeam what are u trying to do
[11:17:22] <supsup> was joke about using parent
[11:17:28] <sunbeam> supsup: eh sorry
[11:17:32] <sunbeam> of course not tthe class, i need the ID
[11:17:38] <sunbeam> supsup: $(this).parent().attr('id') ?
[11:17:40] <supsup> but what are you trying to do?
[11:17:43] <sunbeam> ok
[11:17:44] <sunbeam> i click <a>
[11:17:50] <angryasian> Gates: you got a jsfiddle so I can fiddle around? :D
[11:17:54] <sunbeam> <a> is inside <li class="image-1">
[11:18:00] <sunbeam> <a> is inside <li id="image-1">
[11:18:02] <Gates> angryasian: i do not but I can create one of just 3 lists
[11:18:02] <angryasian> Gates: this sounds like an interesting thing you're trying to do
[11:18:09] <sunbeam> i need to get the id of the li when a is clicked
[11:18:09] <supsup> someone already told u the answer.  $(this).find('#image-1")..etc
[11:18:22] <sunbeam> no because i dont know whether its image-1 -2 etc
[11:18:47] <ajpiano> sunbeam: $(this).closest("li").attr("id");
[11:18:51] <supsup> hurm it's an ancor tag with a Li inside of it?
[11:19:02] <sunbeam> ajpiano: ok
[11:19:03] <supsup> oh it's inside of it
[11:19:06] <sunbeam> yes
[11:19:14] <supsup> yah what aj said...sorry sunbeam for refrencing parent
[11:19:15] <Gates> angryasian: here is teh action -
[11:19:16] <Gates> http://razorjack.net/quicksand/
[11:19:29] <sunbeam> ajpiano: and if i needed the class? the first class?
[11:19:36] <sunbeam> class="image-1 sometclass"
[11:19:37] <ajpiano> .attr("class")
[11:19:44] <sunbeam> ajpiano: yes, but what if there were 2
[11:19:50] <ajpiano> it gives you the entire string
[11:19:57] <ajpiano> .split(" ") will give you an array of classes
[11:19:58] <sunbeam> yes but i need only the first one
[11:19:59] <sunbeam> ok
[11:20:18] <defaultro_> I need to pull the Dodoma value. <span id="city" class="localize" name="city">Dodoma</span>   this works in jsfiddle but not in our app $("#city").val();
[11:20:30] <ajpiano> defaultro_: .text()
[11:20:48] <ajpiano> and there's no reason that would work in jsfiddle either, tbh
[11:20:49] <angryasian> defaultro_: val is supposed to only work for like input / form elements really. try .text()
[11:20:56] <defaultro_> sweet
[11:21:02] <defaultro_> ;)
[11:21:35] <angryasian> Gates: so you want to re-create this using 2 columns?
[11:21:43] <Gates> three
[11:21:52] <Gates> angryasian: I am setting up the fiddle still
[11:22:09] <Gates> angryasian: basically there is the filter at the top and theres 3 subcategories
[11:22:26] <Gates> depending how you filter (at top) the items in the 3 sub category (lists) jump between each other
[11:22:29] <defaultro_> worked! :D
[11:22:31] <monk12> hello all, in our non-ajax web app, we have in the database usually google analytics/adwords string snippets for affiliates to put on our website. A javascript tag string is stored in the database '<script>...</script>' (that we approve to see if its safe)... It also has a location setting like beg-head, end-end, beg-body, end-body) ... now i want to implement this in our ajax app. Can I just $('head').append() and $('body').append() as needed? or do
[11:23:51] <angryasian> monk12: pretty much I'd think so. Did you try it? :)
[11:25:02] <monk12> I'll give it a shot. think i saw something that said document.createElement is more reliable in all browsers vs appending just a string.
[11:25:04] <supsup> if you using ajax won't you have to have like a success setup to draw the results somewhere. etc  just adding a script to the head seems odd.  use getScript prob is what you want then ajax call on success of getting script but i am not 100 percent sure what you mean
[11:25:39] <angryasian> monk12: you would have to manually CALL the functions you insert though I'd think.
[11:26:17] <monk12> hmmm they just google analytics snippets. They should fire on their own when placed on the page.
[11:27:25] <monk12> The script string right now is loaded with a JSON response.  (as they going through a questionnaire and i return the next question in JSON, and also determine if google analytics snippet should be placed and return that in a JSON property)
[11:27:52] <monk12> (some google snippets go on all pages, like our own tracking, and their stuff sometimes goes only at the end of the questionnaire)
[11:28:07] <monk12> but in summary, its a string in JSON.

[11:28:38] <Gates> helpful?
[11:29:02] <blobaugh> anyone in here know about Chosen? i have a select menu that i am loading in via ajax, Chosen is not getting applied to the newly inserted select, and i am assuming it is because it did not exist when the dom was created. i have tried retriggering Chosen with no success. any ideas?
[11:29:52] <monk12> Thanks supsup. Dont think I can use getScript since that requires a url and it would be doublework going back to the server with another request to get the js code(s).
[11:29:55] <totimkopf> angryasian, sorry, I was away for a bit, well, did it work for you when you ran it?
[11:30:06] <totimkopf> it doesn't seem to submit at all
[11:30:16] <totimkopf> revision 17
[11:30:51] <someprimetime> blobaugh: you are triggering it how?
[11:31:07] <someprimetime> trigger('liszt:updated')?
[11:31:13] <Gates> angryasian: better yet http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gQhtw/ (that way i can update it lol)
[11:31:15] <someprimetime> $('.chzn-select').trigger("liszt:updated");
[11:31:31] <blobaugh> someprimetime: http://pastebin.com/1e79cpDu
[11:32:32] <blobaugh> someprimetime: currently everything with class="chosen" gets it applied. this one is being loaded via ajax after the dom is loaded though
[11:32:49] <blobaugh> someprimetime: the menu shows fine, just no chosen
[11:33:55] <barfoo365> Anyone any ideas why this small jquery snippet http://jsfiddle.net/kq9bp/1/ works in jsfiddle but not in WordPress?
[11:33:55] <someprimetime> out of curiosity what happens when you chain $("#StateProvinceText").replaceWith( data , function() {  $('#StateProvinceText').chosen().trigger('liszt:updated'); ?
[11:34:42] <sunbeam> is it possible to specifically define with which <a href> image link lightbox should start?
[11:34:57] <blobaugh> someprimetime: chosen is still not applied
[11:35:26] <someprimetime> what's the event that's triggering this?
[11:35:30] <someprimetime> are you using .on() with it?
[11:36:03] <blobaugh> when a country select menu changes it fires a function that runs the ajax call
[11:36:22] <someprimetime> so .change()?
[11:36:34] <blobaugh> someprimetime: yes
[11:38:57] <sunbeam> how can i simulate a click on a certain $(".active") ?
[11:40:04] <supsup> depends on jquery version.  .trigger('click') or just .click()
[11:40:14] <supsup> http://api.jquery.com/click/
[11:40:14] <Angryasian> $(".active").each(function(index,element) { if ($(element) == whatever) { do things } });
[11:41:08] <Angryasian> I presume you can distinguish between the .actives.  Otherwise you acn just bind a click event to active.
[11:41:10] <supsup> oh you ment like not a real click?
[11:41:16] <Angryasian> Idk what he awnts
[11:41:20] <ecky--ptang-zoob> he wants to fake click his ads :p
[11:41:36] <Angryasian> he wants a simulated click. lol fake click on ads. xD
[11:42:31] <supsup> $('.active').each(function(){$(this).trigger('click')});
[11:42:57] <Angryasian> wlel that'd click EVERY .active thing. He wants to click a particular one
[11:43:23] <supsup> odd if u cheating add clicks might as well go all out yo
[11:43:29] <sunbeam> supsup: thanks
[11:43:32] <Angryasian> haha true
[11:43:47] <sunbeam> Angryasian: thanks
[11:43:59] <Angryasian> In which case.. wouldn't just $('.active').click() do it for EVERYTHING? no need for the each?
[11:44:09] <sunbeam> i think i can just do that
[11:44:09] <sunbeam> sec
[11:44:12] <supsup> if u wanted to be real baller tho, u would prob want to open them all in iframes, and hide the iframes.
[11:44:37] <supsup> yah i think so Angry
[11:44:47] <supsup> i've never faked clicks
[11:44:59] <Angryasian> its against the law!
[11:45:13] <sunbeam> anyway it works thans
[11:45:15] <sunbeam> thanks
[11:45:16] <supsup> i'd lawl if i saw it
[11:45:23] <Gates> Hello Angryasian
[11:45:32] <Angryasian> Hi Gates. My internet sucks
[11:45:35] <Gates> supsup: will do
[11:45:41] <Gates> Angryasian: how so
[11:45:44] <Angryasian> so quicksand eh?
[11:45:50] <Gates> its okay, wont work for the sub cats
[11:46:22] <Gates> http://jsfiddle.net/mprogano/gQhtw/
[11:46:39] <Angryasian> erm.. I'm in India. I think that should be enough explanation. I pay more money than I paid in the USA and get shittier internet. Its fun.
[11:49:34] <jugstah> argument: which is better?
[11:49:44] <jugstah> if (glat == null && glong == null && gcountry == null)
[11:50:00] <jugstah> or if(null!=glat && null!=glong && null!=gcountry)
[11:50:02] <jugstah> ??
[11:51:32] <NoiseEee> jugstah: the first makes it clear that you're comparing a variable against null.
[11:51:53] <NoiseEee> but those are checking different things.
[11:52:12] <jugstah> I'm basically checking a cookie to make sure it doesnt have null or does not exist
[11:52:14] <Gates> Angryasian: im sorry, I just upgraded to 50mbp compared to the average 15mbp
[11:52:14] <Gates> im happy
[11:53:47] <supsup> Gates
[11:53:49] <supsup> http://jsfiddle.net/gQhtw/4/
[11:53:50] <Angryasian> haha. well yeah, I have 2mbps down .5mbps up that used to disconnect every 15mins - hour. now it disconnects every 6 hours. and i pay like 50$ a month :P
[11:54:19] <jugstah> not sure which is my best approach
[11:54:35] <supsup> Gates you would need to add function for typeX and typeY
[11:56:10] <Gates> supsup: can I disable the ability to drag and drop it? The typeX and typeY will be the only way to allow it be sorted
[11:56:40] <supsup> yah u would just make them not sortable and move functionality to click event...have never done it just seems like you should be able to
[11:57:04] <supsup> but also it seems u want that fancy transition stuff
[11:57:21] <supsup> might be easier to look at enhancing quicksand if thats the case
[11:57:34] <Gates> supsup: how would i find such a thing
[11:57:43] <supsup> what do you mean
[11:57:47] <Gates> supsup:  yes maybe, it doesnt seem to be written for "sub-categories" though
[11:59:51] <supsup> sounds like you need a flow etc, there is a lot of things to consider...like how are you filtering, what are the filters.   will each li have a class to tell you what types it can be etc?
[12:01:45] <Gates> supsup: yes, im just not sure where to get started
[12:02:11] <Gates> i guess u can name each column and have it be differnt columsn on differnt filter types and push it to them based on which filter
[12:02:19] <Gates> the plan now is, 2 filters and a hide all
[12:02:26] <Gates> which will reveal text
[12:02:56] <supsup> you should have your flow ironed out before you code anything.  otherwise you will have to rewrite etc.
[12:03:32] <Gates> I have it all here
[12:03:56] <Gates> What is "By Department" and one is "By Services" and the other is "Straight forward" (raw text)
[12:05:00] * jugstah is away. Automatically set away [SZon]
[12:07:22] <supsup> yah no idea i'd just read over quicksand codebase and prob use it as foundation.   sounds like a lot of work ;-0
[12:08:20] <supsup> if you enhance it tho u could contact the author via github or something and maybe he will add your changes to his dilly.
[12:16:34] <fusion27> is there a way to get rid of the if statement on this one and move the class sniffer right in to the selector? http://pastie.org/4612066

[12:19:50] <Gates> supsup: ^better written
[12:20:19] <ryanneufeld> Gates: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/ that might help you
[12:20:35] <Gates> I cannot find where it talked about creating a buttont o do so
[12:21:07] <ryanneufeld> fusion27: self visual prostate exam?
[12:21:45] <ryanneufeld> Gates: you're probably going to need to see ?detach()
[12:21:51] <bot-t> Gates, .detach([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[12:22:01] <ryanneufeld> ?append
[12:22:02] <bot-t> .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[12:22:03] <ryanneufeld> ?appendto
[12:22:04] <bot-t> .appendTo(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the end of the target. http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[12:22:38] <fusion27> ryanneufeld: it's tough to breathe too!!
[12:22:53] <Gates> ryanneufeld: so taking it from one col to the other is detaching and appending it
[12:23:30] <ryanneufeld> Gates: did you read the docs?
[12:23:43] <Gates> now that i know where to read
[12:23:46] <ryanneufeld> :)
[12:23:51] <supsup> from what your saying u don't even care about it being sortable instead u could just have classes on every li, with the type it is, like class="dog animal doestricks"  then use just selectors to make lists
[12:24:26] <supsup> or there is no user sort but via link clicks
[12:24:39] <ryanneufeld> Gates: checkout jsfiddle.net as well. Make sure you choose jquery though from the left. You might find it easy to build a reduced example for yourself
[12:25:28] <Gates> ryanneufeld: i have hte lists made there

[12:47:45] <TelFiRE> I am trying to do basically a slideToggle, but for tech reasons have to animate height instead of using slideToggle. But in order to go back from 0 I had to set a var grabbing the height, unfortunately that means now after clicking it, when I resize the browser and items flow outside the area, the height is not adjusted as it now has a static height value. Hope I'm not too confusing... I'm wondering if there's a way to animate height from 0 to "auto" -- the
[12:47:45] <TelFiRE> natural css height
[12:49:27] <ak> TelFiRE: that is a good question :)

[12:56:06] <synk> hey guys, trying to simulate a click on page load, example is simple but it doesn't call it, whats wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/uy5q3/1/
[13:00:16] <blast_hardcheese> Why does this not do what I expect it to do? http://jsfiddle.net/ChWQx/1/
[13:00:37] <blast_hardcheese> I would expect to get the paragraph out of that document fragment (if that is actually a document fragment)
[13:00:54] <TelFiRE> ak: thanks for the link. So I can switch it to height auto, get that height in a variable, and then animate to it. But the problem I have is that still, once you have clicked the button, you now have a fixed height element. If I resize my browser smaller, stuff flows down underneath and gets cut off.
[13:00:56] <blast_hardcheese> (If it's not, what is it, and how do I get the paragraph out?)
[13:01:58] <MistuhKurtz> TelFiRE, why can't you use slideToggle?
[13:02:07] <MistuhKurtz> what about slideDown and slideUp?
[13:02:38] <TelFiRE> because both of those hide elements outside
[13:02:48] <TelFiRE> I have stuff hanging off the edge that I still wanna show, even though the height is 0
[13:03:27] <xnotte> i want to retrieve content from a webpage that's paginated. How can i navigate by all pages without clicking on it manually ?

[13:05:20] <TelFiRE> I guess if that's the only way to handle it I can

[13:08:31] <chovy> for plugin authoring, under maintaing chainability, it says to always return a jquery object, but the example has return this.each()
[13:08:41] <chovy> what do they mean 'always return a jquery object'
[13:08:53] <chovy> ?
[13:09:10] <synk> hey guys, trying to simulate a click on page load, example is simple but it doesn't call it, whats wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/uy5q3/1/ thnx..
[13:10:01] <chovy> synk: is it already in the dom?
[13:10:38] <synk> yes
[13:12:25] <supsup> chovy pretty sure it means return 'this' in some form.
[13:12:46] <chovy> ok
[13:13:12] <supsup> it says it right there in the doc u mention ~
[13:13:27] <MistuhKurtz> chovy, it should be
[13:13:49] <MistuhKurtz> return this.each(function(){ ... });
[13:13:49] <chovy> it says to return a jquery object
[13:14:07] <chovy> right. that looks like it's returnin this.each that's why iw as confused
[13:14:15] <supsup> So if your plugin doesn't return an intrinsic value, you should always return the this keyword in the immediate scope of the plugin function.
[13:14:18] <stevecrozz> synck: "it doesn't call it"... can you elaborate?
[13:14:57] <MistuhKurtz> chovy, http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/11/essential-jquery-plugin-patterns http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff696759.aspx http://www.debuggable.com/posts/how-to-write-jquery-plugins:4f72ab2e-7310-4a74-817a-0a04cbdd56cb
[13:15:04] <MistuhKurtz> the smashing magazine article is really good.
[13:15:17] <synk> steve: the function works when the element is clicked, all I want to do is trigger that,.
[13:15:27] <synk> on the page load.
[13:15:28] <MistuhKurtz> chovy, "this" refers to the jQuery object
[13:15:38] <chovy> MistuhKurtz: yeah. i see now.
[13:15:47] <chovy> didn't realize 'this' == jQuery
[13:16:02] <MistuhKurtz> well
[13:16:05] <MistuhKurtz> it refers to a jquery collection
[13:16:38] <MistuhKurtz> $(".foo") is a jquery collection. Usually, you instantiate a plugin with it. so, $('.foo').bar();
[13:17:09] <MistuhKurtz> this == the jQuery collection. Which is jQuery, with all of the matching DOM nodes (elements) that have been selected
[13:17:32] <MistuhKurtz> so you use each to iterate over each of the selected DOM nodes that you call the plugin on
[13:17:33] <stevecrozz> synk: i don't know how jplayer works, but if $.jPlayer installs a click event handler, then you're triggering the click too early
[13:18:52] <hashpuppy> i want to load different html when a certain tab is selected.  the problem is that the html is similar in structure and shares the same tag id.  do you guys know of a templating system that will allow me to embed these templates not in html, but in some other form, so i don't have a duplicate problem when i select on that tag?
[13:18:53] <MistuhKurtz> so chovy, when you 'return this' then it returns the entire jQuery collection. This is how chaining works
[13:19:35] <stevecrozz> synk: i just looked at the documentation, triggering a click event is likely not exactly what you want, for example if you want your jplayer to play, you can just call "play" : http://www.jplayer.org/latest/developer-guide/#jPlayer-play

[13:23:21] <synk> k, need to revisit the doc, thnx steve
[13:23:33] <synk> trying this the hard way :)
[13:26:09] <xnotte> i want to retrieve content from a webpage that's paginated. How can i navigate by all pages without clicking on it manually ?
[13:27:11] <supsup> use yql and scrape it http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/
[13:28:32] <supsup> also u might want to check their source code, maybe just a json response that you can alter to return all results much like reddit has .json to every post
[13:29:22] <xnotte> supsup: ok thanks
[13:31:32] <jimzin> hello. i'm asking this here since #css is a bit tired right now, i'm sure there are css guys around here; is it possible to have two divs next to each other fill a certain width while only specifying the width of one of the divs; so the other div adapts adequatly?
[13:34:53] <ak> jimzin: not with pure css
[13:34:58] <garbagegod> I have a plugin that's initialized like $("#domelement").pluginname({option1: 'value'}); as is typical
[13:35:11] <garbagegod> I need to reinitialize this plugin though with a different option1 value
[13:35:14] <garbagegod> How can I do that
[13:35:18] <ak> but you can make something like it with more divs, and some tricks ;)
[13:36:01] <ak> garbagegod: this depends on what plugin you use...
[13:36:47] <jimzin> ak: there is really no way, you sure?
[13:36:58] <garbagegod> https://raw.github.com/devbridge/jQuery-Autocomplete/master/src/jquery.autocomplete.js
[13:37:34] <ak> well you can make one container, the first div float left, width some width, and the second not float, but make it overflow hidden
[13:37:45] <ak> and use some clearfix
[13:37:53] <ak> and that should do the trick...
[13:38:35] <jimzin> ak: you really sure? since this is kindof working (using a container div, of course): http://jsfiddle.net/kYtqV/2/
[13:38:51] <jimzin> ak: '#header' is a horrible name, should be '#sidebar'
[13:39:27] <ak> there it is :)
[13:39:32] <ak> that's what i just old you ;)
[13:39:35] <Raydiation> how can i get a further down children of an element? $('#elem').find('.chilClass') ?
[13:40:03] <supsup> jimzin: http://jsfiddle.net/BnAzt/
[13:40:19] <ak> Raydiation: yes
[13:40:25] <Raydiation> ak: ty
[13:40:40] <jimzin> supsup: that's exactly like it
[13:40:42] <jimzin> ;)
[13:42:03] <supsup> just set a height on your right side
[13:42:28] <sunbeam> any slidesjs users?
[13:43:19] <supsup> might have to use js if it is dynamic height
[13:45:02] <supsup> http://jsfiddle.net/kYtqV/4/
[13:45:20] <xnotte> supsup: its not ajax. it loads the page every nextpage click. Can't i click the "next page" element with jquery ?
[13:45:58] <supsup> no idea what you mean.  I thought u just wanted data from someone elses site
[13:50:22] <jaysern> I have a question about using $.when() with chained ajax calls. if I have 2 ajax calls, one firing on success of the other, how do I do a $.when() when they both complete?
[13:50:47] <jaysern> some pseudo code of what i'm trying to accomplish: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1783658
[13:51:55] <xnotte> supsup: yes but its paginated and there are 4000 pages
[13:51:59] <supsup> the example @ http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/ does not cover that?
[13:52:11] <supsup> yah mak yql script
[13:52:20] <xnotte> supsup: i have to make the script change page
[13:52:37] <xnotte> but without yql ?
[13:52:52] <supsup> what does 'make the script change page' mean
[13:53:06] <xnotte> click on "next page"
[13:53:47] <supsup> yah learn yql or some other scrapper.  how else do you expect to do it
[13:53:56] <supsup> there are node.js scrappers you can use also
[13:54:48] <supsup> your problem does not really appear to be jquery specific.  but it's very possible i just don't understand what you mean
[13:56:19] <xnotte> supsup: i want determine the number of pages in jquery, and make a loop. But i need to programatically make the site load the "next page"
[13:56:32] <MistuhKurtz> jaysern, use Deferred
[13:56:46] <supsup> why what are you going to use the data for.
[13:57:08] <supsup> is the data hosted on your site?
[13:57:27] <sethetter> Using jQuery UI's draggable doesn't work for mobile devices, does anyone know of a workaround for this?
[13:57:45] <xnotte> no, its an external site, school work
[13:58:06] <supsup> if it is you could just make a json output of it, would be a lot simpler and cleaner,  if it's not then you will need to setup a scraper to grab the data and store it
[13:58:18] <supsup> or just scrap it everytime
[13:58:33] <supsup> u might want to check with them first if that's cool as well
[13:59:06] <xnotte> the webpage its already built and its not json
[14:00:43] <supsup> dont know bro sounds like a scrape job to me.  same domain going to ruin your day trying to use ajax etc.
[14:01:04] <xnotte> a what?
[14:02:25] <supsup> scrape that data, store that data, make cron job on scrape to temp database, do binary comparison on them data in database tables, if different update yo data
[14:04:09] <supsup> obviously you could add perl script in there to, or python or java or node.js etc to pretty up that data before you store it too.
[14:04:10] <xnotte> supsup: i don't know what you talking about i just wanna know if i can with jquery force the browser to click <a>
[14:04:26] <supsup> on a site you don't control?
[14:04:33] <supsup> make greesemonkey script maybe
[14:04:52] <supsup> https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/
[14:05:43] <xnotte> supsup: can't i load it to a iframe in my page?
[14:05:51] <xnotte> the source page
[14:05:54] <supsup> and then what?
[14:06:14] <supsup> the iframe is a different domain, back to that whole ruin your day comment
[14:07:18] <hashpuppy> stupid question.  i have $("input.autonumeric").autoNumeric(), which obviously will not work when new input fields are created with class="autonumeric".  is there any way to have autoNumeric() called on that selector when new ones are created?  or must i manually do this
[14:07:20] <xnotte> supsup: ruin why?
[14:07:28] <supsup> you can't do anything in the iframe
[14:07:33] <supsup> from your parent
[14:08:09] <xnotte> so it must be a greasemonkey
[14:08:27] <sethetter> Answered my own question. For those interested: Making jQuery UI compatible with touch events (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6745098/jquery-ui-sortable-doesnt-work-on-touch-devices-based-on-android-or-ios)
[14:08:41] <xnotte> you're saying that will ruin my day because of security policys ?
[14:08:44] <supsup> There is a hack for it, alex sexton has a post about it.  You have to be in kahoots with the other iframe owner tho. they have to add stuff to their webserver.
[14:09:08] <supsup> xnotte yah.  Greese monkey would only work on your local machine and while you on that site.
[14:09:39] <xnotte> supsup: but its my schools domain, within a course program...
[14:10:14] <supsup> so what your saying is they would not go in to kahoots with you right.
[14:10:38] <linuxR> hi, I have question regarding event handling: I create a div element by script, using "var myElem = document.createElement()" and appending it to the body. Now I would like to add an alert when clicking this div. I tried "myElem.on("click", function(){alert('xxx');});", but just nothing happens...any explanation why?
[14:11:22] <sethetter> linuxR: did you try myElem.click(function(e) { .. } ); ??
[14:11:42] <linuxR> sethetter, yes, same result
[14:11:46] <xnotte> supsup: of course not
[14:11:46] <supsup> $("<div />").addClass("myClass").click(function(){});
[14:12:24] <supsup> guess you don't actually need addClass...and append it somewhere
[14:12:58] <sethetter> linuxR: the 'myElem' needs to be a jQuery object.
[14:13:03] <supsup> yah so back to the whole scrape solution.  Sounds like you need to learn how to scrape dem der data.
[14:13:22] <sethetter> linuxR: Try selecting it with $() and then adding the click handler
[14:13:33] <supsup> $("<div />").click(function(){}).appendTo('body');
[14:13:48] <supsup> might want to give it some html too or they can't really click on it
[14:14:00] <linuxR> sethetter, yes that works indeed! but why can't I just use the dom element reference?
[14:14:15] <supsup> your in a jquery channel.
[14:14:30] <sethetter> Because the jQuery click events are only compatible with jQuery objects.
[14:14:53] <sethetter> linuxR: the .click() handler is part of the jQuery object methods
[14:14:57] <linuxR> when I compare $("$mydiv")  with my "myElem" variable, it says they're equal?
[14:16:17] <supsup> not even sure u can do $("$..")
[14:16:33] <linuxR> should be $("#mydiv"), sorry
[14:16:33] <supsup> i never have anyway...must be missing out
[14:17:03] <hashpuppy> why can't jquery have something like $(".foo").live("create", function() { ... });
[14:17:10] <hashpuppy> where create was an event
[14:17:17] <supsup> so that jquery object returns like a string i think. those two strings are equal.  Not the jquery object and the dom object (prob want to get the big guns on this one i'm prob wrng)
[14:17:35] <jrockjiggz> linuxR: if say you has var d = document.createElement('div').  to use click you'd need to: $(d).on('click'...   see http://stackoverflow.com/a/6976126
[14:18:28] <jrockjiggz> hashpuppy: you should be able to if you bind('create')
[14:19:20] <linuxR> that works jrockjiggz , awesome! but that means that $() is something diffrent than I thought it was :)
[14:20:11] <Keu> I'm a bit stuck trying to get .find() to make selections within an element. Its only successful if the elements are wrapped in another tag. Here is an example. http://jsfiddle.net/3ypKk/1/
[14:20:15] <jrockjiggz> $() is a jquery query for dom element.  once found, preserved it as a jquery object that jquery functions reference.  without $() jquery functions won't know it as a jquery object
[14:20:55] <jrockjiggz> linuxR: so you can use myelem = ..., but need to wrap $(myelem). before using on('click')
[14:21:20] <linuxR> that makes all sense now. thanks for the explanations jrockjiggz !
[14:22:04] <supsup> Keu: http://jsfiddle.net/3ypKk/2/ -- you find inside your target
[14:22:08] <supsup> so if u go up a lvl
[14:22:12] <supsup> then it will work
[14:22:53] <jrockjiggz> Keu: you'll need to use filter()
[14:23:15] <jrockjiggz> filter() includes parent
[14:23:25] <Keu> ah. Thanks guys
[14:24:01] <Keu> Hmm. filter doesn't seem to work but .parent().find does
[14:24:27] <supsup> that is kind of interesting
[14:24:46] <supsup> tho...that it makes html after the first closing div but does not make it equal to the variable
[14:24:52] <Keu> Oh wait. I must have AppendTo body after the find occurs
[14:27:12] <Keu> Intersting that http://jsfiddle.net/3ypKk/4/ is the opposite of http://jsfiddle.net/3ypKk/1/
[14:28:07] <joelwallis> Hi. I need to get the counting of elements that jQuery is getting with a js query. Ex: totalItems = $("#slider ul li");
[14:28:20] <joelwallis> how can i know how many li items its getting?
[14:28:30] <jaysern> MistuhKurtz: still trying to wrap my head around how to use Deferred. would you mind showing me a psuedo code of how i'd accomplish this? http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1783658
[14:28:56] <jrockjiggz> Keu: makes perfect sense
[14:29:16] <jrockjiggz> joelwallis: $('li').length
[14:30:43] <xnotte> i have a <a id="7748" ...> why this doesnt work $("#7748").trigger('click');  ? says TypeError: $("#7748") is null
[14:31:03] <sunbeam> any slidesjs users?
[14:31:08] <jrockjiggz> xnotte id cannot start with a number
[14:32:24] <supsup> Keu :  maybe more clear way of adding html to dom :   http://jsfiddle.net/3ypKk/6/
[14:32:30] <supsup> or nodes to dom rather
[14:33:16] <xnotte> jrockjiggz: can i make the click in the 'a' element where title equals "something " ?
[14:33:27] <jrockjiggz> $('a[title=whatever]')
[14:33:31] <xnotte> thanks
[14:34:33] <jrockjiggz> xnotte: beware this is much slower than id
[14:34:41] <Raydiation> any idea why the console.log on line 16 prints out none https://pastee.org/enge2 when getting the css background-image?
[14:35:02] <xnotte> jrockjiggz: ok thank you for the warning
[14:35:18] <Keu> supsup: That's a good idea.  I might try temporary append to Dom. Making selections and then using .detach()
[14:35:55] <Raydiation> btw: this._$htmlElement = $('<li>');
[14:36:52] <supsup> console.log the data.icon
[14:36:52] <jrockjiggz> Raydiation: i dont see why, except i don't know if .css('background-image') will return any value..
[14:37:11] <xnotte> jrockjiggz: the id its not a number and i still have the typerror:  $('a[title=test]').trigger('click'); is null
[14:37:39] <supsup> or what does iconCss =
[14:37:43] <jrockjiggz> xnotte: console.log( $('a[title=test]').length );
[14:38:04] <Raydiation> supsup: simply build the url("path/to/img.png") string
[14:38:49] <jrockjiggz> Raydiation: console.log( this._$htmlElement )
[14:39:07] <jrockjiggz> it may not be jquery object?
[14:40:08] <supsup> yah i'd debug it and step through it shoudl show you error a lot easier then guessing. like add a watch to data.icon and see if the $htmlElement is really a jquery object etc
[14:40:13] <Raydiation> jrockjiggz: [li]
[14:40:50] <Raydiation> is the style only applied after putting into the dom?
[14:41:10] <xnotte> jrockjiggz: null....but it's there
[14:41:41] <Raydiation> the weird thing is, the css is set correctly
[14:41:50] <Raydiation> if i render it
[14:42:39] <supsup> is only 1 thing calling this code?
[14:42:54] <supsup> maybe your seeing console of another call to it
[14:43:22] <Raydiation> hm, var lii = $('<li>').css('background-image', 'url("test.png")'); produces: TypeError: $("<li>") is null
[14:43:30] <Raydiation> in firebug
[14:44:25] <supsup> not in chrome.
[14:44:52] <Raydiation> weird
[14:47:05] <supsup> you sure you have jquery on page?
[14:48:50] <Raydiation> yes
[14:48:56] <supsup> also make sure your jquery is defined before you call this code.  maybe when using console. it's registering because by then it's loaded it but when this code is called it does not have access to jquery
[14:49:06] <supsup> same command works for me in FF btw also
[14:49:26] <xnotte> jrockjiggz: it does not have errors now. But shouldnt the $('#id').trigger('click') work as if i clicked myself ? and load the <a ?
[14:49:36] <Raydiation> well, it works fine, just the unittest is failing in firefox
[14:49:38] <Raydiation> ill just remove it
[14:49:49] <Raydiation> or put a comment into it
[14:51:44] <hye> hi
[14:52:44] <hye> I have an ajax loader that loads <div> elements.  these <div style="display: none;"> dynamically load into the DOM.  how can I have jquery detect each time such an element is in the
[14:52:52] <hye> DOM and switch its visbility to .show()?
[14:55:00] <jexmex> I am using .change() and have it inside a document ready function, but it is called on page load, any ways to avoid this?
[14:55:35] <supsup> xnotte:  $("#id")[0].click();
[14:57:44] <xnotte> supsup: thanks it worked
[15:07:04] <KWhat_Work> Just curious; Has anyone noticed that the button sizes are different heights?  http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/
[15:07:33] * KWhat_Work ::shakes head::
[15:08:19] <jexmex> thats interesting, firebug shows same height, but they look different
[15:08:45] <KWhat_Work> Thats exactly why I hate working with css ;)
[15:08:58] <jexmex> oh no it dont
[15:09:10] <jexmex> 25px 23px and 25px
[15:09:15] <KWhat_Work> hmm
[15:09:41] <KWhat_Work> ahh there is an open bug #7996
[15:10:07] <jexmex> nobody has any thoughts on my issue?
[15:10:23] <jexmex> probably simple, but I am not exactly a jquery guru
[15:10:32] <KWhat_Work> jexmex: whats the issue im late to the party
[15:10:40] <jexmex> I am using .change() and have it inside a document ready function, but it is called on page load, any ways to avoid this?
[15:11:11] <jexmex> its for a multiselect box using a jquery plugin (think its called ui.multiselect)
[15:12:17] <KWhat_Work> Ahh wonderful we have to wait for jquery ui 1.10 to solve this problem
[15:14:00] <KWhat_Work> so the change listener on the multi select box is fireing after the document is ready?
[15:17:00] <jexmex> yes
[15:17:07] <supsup> why not move it out of the document.ready function and put it right after your selector appears or add a delegate to attach change
[15:20:08] <Raydiation> any idea why i dont get the alert when i click on the button? https://pastee.org/3ynpx
[15:21:33] <Raydiation> can i only bind click when the element is appended to the dom?
[15:21:36] <jexmex> supsup: what do you mean?
[15:21:42] <jexmex> I have the code at the bottom of the page
[15:22:19] <Raydiation> got it, wrong var :P
[15:25:36] <Phoenixz> Question on jQuery mobile. I know I should be on #jquerymobile, but nobody has been responding there all day, and Im hoping somebody here might..  I have a <ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true"> with li with <a> anchors in them. For some reason, I need to click on 2 different links before I slide to the next page..  I click on link, nothing. Same link twice, nothing, I click another one and its opens..
[15:25:46] <Phoenixz> Is this a known problem? Anybody any idea what I might be doing wrong?
[15:26:42] <Phoenixz> Using jQuery mobile 1.1.1, by the way
[15:35:35] <WhoopYeah> Hi. Does anyone know how to make this better https://pastee.org/3bdyw
[15:35:38] <WhoopYeah> Trying to get javascript to add a number of <li> based on the number already existing.
[15:40:53] <tw2113> i'd probably try to set a variable for how many you want, and then just check if the count is less than that. Then do the math for how many you want minus how many you have and do a while loop to get to that desired total
[15:40:56] <tw2113> if that makes sense
[15:44:26] <WhoopYeah> tw2113: 1st part makes total sense, but Im a newb, so am rather lost. I think I can jumble together some code to work out the maths part. The main problem is how do I add the same chunk of code a number of times?
[15:46:40] <WhoopYeah> I mean how would I add <li>Something</li> multiple times based on a number?
[15:49:29] <tash> having a hard time putting this in code. I have a table with several rows.  Each row contains a record with an id like id="jobend-123" where the 123 part is unique.  I want to do "for each <td> in my table where id starts with jobend, if html() != '' do something.
[15:50:47] <tash> so, was thinking $( '#id-of-table td' ).each(function() {  // something } :P
[15:51:05] <tash> but not sure what to put there, or even if i'm starting out right
[15:59:56] <KWhat_Work> Anyone know if the base class that is used on the jquery-ui website is documented anywhere?  It changes the way all themes looks, particularly with padding and margins, but is not included with any of the themes... O_o
[16:05:28] <tw2113> WhoopYeah, sorry, had to tinker
[16:05:29] <tw2113> http://pastebin.com/zmKvEDVE
[16:09:56] <tash> this is in a table, http://pastie.org/4613178, how can i check the value of each of those <td class="jobend" id="jobend<?=$value->jobid()?>"  ?  Just assume $value->jobid() equates to a unique number, b/c it does.
[16:10:01] <WhoopYeah> tw2113: Thats amazing cheers
[16:10:47] <tw2113> need explanation of any parts of it?
[16:11:34] <tash> I'm going AFK for a little bit, but will definitely be back if anyone has any tips for me. Time to eat.
[16:13:33] <WhoopYeah> tw2113: i get most of it ;) I always get abit lost when I see i = something.
[16:13:46] <tw2113> just a single letter variable
[16:14:27] <WhoopYeah> So can you use any letter but people just always use? I thought it was something more special
[16:14:30] <tw2113> i could use zee if i wanted
[16:14:43] <WhoopYeah> I see
[16:14:51] <tw2113> maybe
[16:14:53] <tw2113> *tinkers*
[16:15:04] <tw2113> maybe i/j is special
[16:15:10] <shoky> tash: $('#tableid td[id^=jobend]').each( function() { var el = $(this); if (el.html() != '') { smth } } )
[16:15:31] <tw2113> or i'm just capped out
[16:15:56] <tw2113> yeah, i forgot to change the total amount :D
[16:17:14] <WhoopYeah> :)

[16:22:27] <shesek> http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/
[16:27:10] <RabSimpson> for some reason, this isn't working - $('form#your-profile option[value="site_admin"]').hide();
[16:27:58] <sunbeam> hey
[16:28:04] <sunbeam> I developed a site
[16:28:10] <sunbeam> with all sorts of jquery functionality
[16:28:12] <rev_icon> hey
[16:28:15] <rev_icon> I just met you
[16:28:18] <rev_icon> and this is crazy
[16:28:26] <sunbeam> but none of the jquery things work in IE9
[16:28:30] <sunbeam> no clicks nothing
[16:28:36] <sunbeam> how can i find whats wrong?
[16:29:01] <rev_icon> sunbeam: first step would be to look at your javascript console and see what javascript error is being thrown (I'm sure there is one)
[16:29:32] <sunbeam> in IE?
[16:29:55] <sunbeam> didnt know there was one
[16:30:30] <tw2113> F12
[16:31:33] <rev_icon> sunbeam:  lemme google that for you.    http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg699336(v=vs.85).aspx
[16:32:02] <sunbeam> thanks guys
[16:32:14] <sinclair> crap i will never sleep =| why doesn't slideDown work? isn't it allowed to have .hide().slideDown('slow'); ??
[16:32:19] <sunbeam> what the
[16:32:20] <sunbeam> ok
[16:32:36] <sunbeam> when i start IE9, and i open the site, the functionality (slider)  doesn't work
[16:32:41] <sunbeam> When I open F12
[16:32:43] <sunbeam> and refresh, it does
[16:36:05] <sunbeam> nvm was some syntax error
[16:36:15] <sunbeam> weird though this seems fixed with console opened
[16:37:30] <KWhat_Work> ef, the selector is now broken...
[16:47:02] <tw2113> rmurphey, good episode on Shop Talk
[16:53:10] <sinclair> how do i handle jquery on dynamic content? i'm creating a table row with javascript and now i want to use .slideDown on it
[16:53:42] <Eviltwin> sinclair: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[16:53:50] <Eviltwin> Please look at the forms it can take
[17:00:21] <grantgalitz> http://i.minus.com/iz3w8ndBI5A9R.gif
[17:00:30] <martisj> are there any good javascript ides out there?
[17:07:23] <lrvick> http://lrvick.tawlk.com/ anyone know why the slider() on the bottom will not slide? Clicking it produces a slidechange event, but it does not actually move
[17:09:17] <bung> lrvick: have you had it working ever? somewhere else?
[17:09:31] <bung> usually i like to break down the problem and post it to jsfiddle
[17:09:53] <lrvick> i know i can make it work on jsfiddle nd by itself
[17:09:59] <lrvick> but for some reason something about this css comniation
[17:10:01] <lrvick> seems to be breaking it
[17:10:28] <bung> you figure its css eh? usually i just cut out big portions until i find whats conflicting
[17:10:36] <bung> if i cant get a sense of it from firebug
[17:11:07] <tash> shoky: still around?
[17:11:20] <shoky> tash: ye
[17:11:35] <tash> thanks for your tip, I got further, here is my latest pastie http://pastie.org/4613422
[17:11:51] <tash> I know I'm making it in the if( jobComplete != '' )
[17:12:32] <tash> so what I want to do is set html = '' for all id's that start with jobend WHERE all id's that start with jobfinished != ''
[17:12:36] <shoky> tash you didn't close the [
[17:12:44] <tash> basically, hide jobend value if jobfinished isn't empty
[17:12:46] <tash> oh, hmm, sec
[17:13:43] <shoky> what do you mean 'WHERE' ?
[17:14:21] <shoky> you mean you want to get the jobend td from the same row as the jobfinished td that has non-empty id?
[17:14:32] <shoky> because you wouldn't need a second loop for that..
[17:14:44] <tash> yeah, let me try to say it better...
[17:15:34] <tash> for ever row if the id that starts with jobfinished has a value other than '', I want to hide that same row's jobend
[17:15:38] <tash> does that make more sense?
[17:15:39] <shoky> yeah
[17:17:02] <shoky> tash: http://pastie.org/4613447
[17:17:33] <shoky> on line 10 it needs to be jobEnd
[17:17:39] <blast_hardcheese> How do I select the style elements in this: http://jsfiddle.net/ChWQx ?
[17:18:26] <shoky> blast_hardcheese: there's no style elements there
[17:19:04] <blast_hardcheese> shoky: Hmm... thought I hit update
[17:19:09] <JJ387> hello all, could someone help me whith > http://pastebin.com/FBuida2H pleas ?  thank your for your time ^^
[17:19:09] <blast_hardcheese> there should be one in <head>
[17:20:02] <shoky> blast_hardcheese: also when you do $(html) it snips out the <html> and <body>
[17:20:16] <blast_hardcheese> That's probably why then
[17:20:24] <shoky> blast_hardcheese: if you hit update you need to give the new link..
[17:20:32] <blast_hardcheese> so it only takes the inside of the <body> ?
[17:20:38] <shoky> yea
[17:20:39] <blast_hardcheese> shoky: Right, that was intended to be the new link ;)
[17:21:03] <shoky> hitting update would add a  /1/ to the end of the URL
[17:21:04] <tash> shoky: I think that did it, but I need to test to make sure.
[17:21:06] <blast_hardcheese> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/ChWQx/5/ is what it was supposed to look like
[17:22:40] <tash> shoky: I think it actually emptied ALL the jobends, regardless of jobfinished
[17:22:51] <tash> but I'll test more soon...gotta get kids ready for bed! :P
[17:22:53] <lrvick> ok so nevermind im full of it. Apparently I don't know how to use jquery sliders: http://jsfiddle.net/HBYaw/
[17:22:55] <lrvick> any ideas?
[17:23:22] <blast_hardcheese> Did the behavior of $() stripping out everything but <body>'s content change between 1.7.2 and 1.8?
[17:23:48] <blast_hardcheese> That was for shoky, forgot to hilight
[17:24:08] <shoky> blast_hardcheese: donno, but i doubt it
[17:24:13] <sinclair> hah so .slideDown() doesn't work on tr?
[17:24:17] <sinclair> that explains it
[17:24:23] <shoky> blast_hardcheese: because it uses .innerHTML if available
[17:24:33] <shoky> blast_hardcheese: it's not jquery doing the snipping
[17:24:44] <shoky> i think.
[17:25:17] <shoky> blast_hardcheese: and it's not everything but the <body>'s content
[17:25:34] <shoky> blast_hardcheese: it just strips out some specific tags like <html> and <head>
[17:25:46] <blast_hardcheese> interesting
[17:25:52] <shoky> console.log(foo) and you'll see exactly what remains..
[17:26:43] <blast_hardcheese> Right, so the style is still in foo, why can't I select-- Oh, because the style is a top-level object in foo
[17:26:48] <blast_hardcheese> and it doesn't contain another style
[17:26:52] <blast_hardcheese> makes sense
[17:26:52] <shoky> yep
[17:27:00] <blast_hardcheese> I'll wrap it in a div.
[17:27:10] <blast_hardcheese> thanks shoky
[17:27:25] <shoky> yw
[17:28:30] <blast_hardcheese> brilliant, works like a charm.
[17:33:14] <oojacoboo> so, I have an interesting one for you guys (promise)
[17:33:37] <oojacoboo> so, I'm generating a list of printable "pages" within an ajax app, the main view
[17:33:38] <RabSimpson> hi folks, i've got a list item which contains an unneeded pipe | character. is there any way i can remove it?
[17:34:01] <oojacoboo> I have a print template that I'm using for the actual printing, but it's also used for media screen to show what it will look like
[17:34:16] <oojacoboo> the issue is that it sets all kinds of things, including on the body/html that are necessary
[17:34:38] <oojacoboo> so, I want to show these within the standard view somehow, without having to completely rewrite all the css
[17:34:57] <oojacoboo> I'm thinking an iframe will do the trick, but the list is ajax filtered and reloaded with a filtering form
[17:35:27] <oojacoboo> is there a way to ajax load and target an iframe?  (pretty positive not)  How might I go about isolating this for the view?  Any ideas?
[17:35:48] <oojacoboo> RabSimpson, .replace("|", "");
[17:36:01] <RabSimpson> oojacoboo, magic thanks :)
[17:36:01] <subsonic> So I have to keep tracks of the state of an element (or like keep track of data associated with it). Is there a unique identifier for each element I can use to store that in an array or should I just use .data() with it?
[17:36:33] <oojacoboo> use .data() that's the purpose of it
[17:38:21] <HAPPYFUNBRO> how would I go about creating a sidebar that scrolls a bit, and then stays fixed?
[17:40:58] <RabSimpson> oojacoboo, not sure where i went wrong. the list item also had a link in it, but it's stripped the anchor tag off it.
[17:40:59] <RabSimpson> $('ul.subsubsub li.editor').html($('ul.subsubsub li.editor').text().replace("|", ""));
[17:41:12] <RabSimpson> any ideas?
[17:41:34] <oojacoboo> RabSimpson, for one, set a variable there
[17:41:41] <RabSimpson> where?
[17:41:48] <oojacoboo> ul.subsubsub.....
[17:42:06] <RabSimpson> that's the list selector...
[17:42:16] <oojacoboo> yes, make it a var, don't repeat yourself
[17:42:35] <RabSimpson> i'm not too worried about that just now. i can replace it later.
[17:42:47] <oojacoboo> subsubsub.text().replace()
[17:42:58] <subsonic> oojacoboo: Thanks.  And even though I don't know how to say your name, it's a cool name
[17:43:06] <RabSimpson> i tried that and it didn't work
[17:43:16] <oojacoboo> ?testcase
[17:43:17] <bot-t> http://xkr.us/js/testcase
[17:43:19] <RabSimpson> $('ul.subsubsub li.editor').text().replace("|", "");
[17:43:32] <oojacoboo> ?testcase @ RabSimpson
[17:43:32] <bot-t> RabSimpson, http://xkr.us/js/testcase
[17:44:14] <oojacoboo> make a fiddle
[17:44:15] <RabSimpson> let me pastebin the code for you, it's a backend app
[17:44:27] <oojacoboo> no pastebin, use jsfiddle.net
[17:44:32] <RabSimpson> ok
[17:45:11] * RabSimpson suddenly feels right out of his depth
[17:46:03] <tash> shoky: yeah, so it is removing all of the jobend's
[17:46:09] <tash> or should I say, emptying all of them.
[17:46:32] <tash> maybe the problem is the != ''
[17:47:47] <RabSimpson> oojacoboo: http://jsfiddle.net/6wFyp/
[17:50:04] <tash> shoky, isn't this saying if the id isn't empty, move on? var jobComplete = $( this ).attr( 'id' ); if( jobComplete != '' )
[17:52:26] <tash> fwiw, think I solved it.
[17:54:28] <blast_hardcheese> Is there a way to prevent $("<div />", {html: "some HTML"}) from issuing xhr requests to load the assets for that object? I'm trying to strip out redundant js and css files so they don't muck up my project
[17:56:49] <oojacoboo> RabSimpson, http://jsfiddle.net/6wFyp/2/
[17:57:18] <RabSimpson> did you just change text to html?
[17:57:22] <oojacoboo> I did
[17:57:50] <RabSimpson> awesome, thanks :)
[18:01:42] <RabSimpson> oojacoboo, thanks for your help, i'm outta here :)
[18:01:47] <oojacoboo> np
[18:08:31] <p3rtutt1> http://hash.makemilk.net/
[18:12:00] <mattyhead> Random question:  I see .click adding functions for each time a hander is passed... Anyone know if this is a bug or if it is intended?
[18:17:18] <mattyhead> To expand:  $("#someelement").click( function () {alert(this.id)}); where this.id gets modified from time to time builds up a series of functions.  Call it with id 1 and i get an alert "1".  Call while this.id is 2 and I get two alerts:  "1" and "2".
[18:17:48] <mattyhead> Do you think that's featury or buggy?
[18:18:58] <shoky> mattyhead: uhh, #someelement's id gets modified..?
[18:19:13] <shoky> mattyhead: or, what do you think 'this' is ?
[18:19:19] <mattyhead> shoky, no, this.id is being called when something else is changed
[18:19:43] <shoky> mattyhead: what do you think 'this' is, in the callback?
[18:19:55] <shoky> because what it is is the clicked element, namely #someelement
[18:19:56] <mattyhead> not a callback issue.
[18:20:08] <shoky> it's not..?
[18:20:09] <mattyhead> it gets assigned and then gets reassigned
[18:20:12] <mattyhead> no.
[18:20:14] <shoky> what gets assigned
[18:20:16] <mattyhead> we're adding fucntions
[18:20:25] <shoky> 'this' changes between function calls..
[18:20:31] <mattyhead> if you call with this.id = 1
[18:20:37] <mattyhead> and then this.id=2
[18:20:38] <shoky> what is 'with' ?
[18:20:42] <shoky> you dont call it
[18:20:44] <shoky> you just click the button
[18:20:51] <mattyhead> certainly
[18:20:55] <shoky> mattyhead: what is 'this'?
[18:21:15] <mattyhead> in this case, an li, but that's incidental
[18:21:18] <shoky> no
[18:21:22] <shoky> see, that's where you are wrong
[18:21:24] <shoky> it is not the li
[18:21:26] <shoky> it is the clicked element
[18:21:38] <shoky> because that's what jquery sets 'this' to be inside the callback
[18:21:54] <shoky> you should never use 'this' unless you know what's going on
[18:22:08] <mattyhead> not relevant, i promise.
[18:22:11] <shoky> heh
[18:22:14] <shoky> i promise you, it is..
[18:22:20] <mattyhead> the issue is that we're getting 2 alerts for 1 click
[18:22:25] <MistuhKurtz> not just jquery, javascript itself assigns 'this' to the owner object of a function
[18:22:34] <MistuhKurtz> the object that the function is a method of
[18:22:42] <shoky> well its an anonymous function
[18:22:42] <jamesdotnet> If you're adding a new click handler every time you change a value, that's probably a bug in your code. So yes, a bug.
[18:22:43] <shoky> so ;p
[18:22:46] <MistuhKurtz> yes
[18:22:55] <shoky> well it depends how jquery calls the callback
[18:22:56] <mattyhead> it's 2 anonymous functions.
[18:22:59] <shoky> anyways
[18:23:01] <MistuhKurtz> an anonymous function that is owned by that object (element)
[18:23:10] <mattyhead> until you set the click event with another value
[18:23:12] <mattyhead> then it's 3
[18:23:36] <shoky> mattyhead: you obviously don't know what you're doing, i can't imagine what other errors you have in your code
[18:23:41] <jamesdotnet> You don't "set the click event with a value"
[18:23:45] <mattyhead> none, thank you shoky
[18:23:48] <blast_hardcheese> I suspect there's a better way to do this, but I'm not really sure what to even look for: http://blast.hardchee.se/~/files/2012-08-29/loadTemplate.js
[18:23:55] <shoky> right
[18:24:28] <mattyhead> so noone knows about click(handler) resulting in a new handler event being tacked on after the last one/
[18:24:31] <mattyhead> ?
[18:24:32] <blast_hardcheese> (I really don't like that code, but it's the only way I know to describe what I'm trying to do)
[18:24:44] <shoky> mattyhead: .click(...) adds a new handler tacked on after the last one.
[18:24:49] <jamesdotnet> mattyhead: Yes, that's what it does.
[18:24:49] <blast_hardcheese> mattyhead: How many times are you calling click()?
[18:25:07] <mattyhead> excellent.  so i'm full of it.  that's actually a relief.
[18:25:14] <ejcweb> I want to send a post request, with json data, but for it to behave like the submission of a normal html form (ie. It will redirect to the page I am posting to). Is this possible?
[18:25:17] * blast_hardcheese highfives mattyhead 
[18:25:23] <mattyhead> heh.
[18:25:35] <mattyhead> i'll describe the page briefly...
[18:26:04] <shoky> ejcweb: you can just submit a form..
[18:26:34] <blast_hardcheese> Anyone have any ideas regarding my attempting to prune $.get responses before passing the data to .html() ?
[18:26:42] <PKKid> What does this line around javascript source do?   !function($) { ... }(window.jQuery);
[18:26:57] <ejcweb> shoky: How can I include the JSON data? (such as a JS array).
[18:27:06] <mattyhead> a menu element is clicked and buttons get click events loaded in.  that didn't take long.
[18:27:21] <blast_hardcheese> PKKid: Not sure what the ! at the front is for, but that'll ensure that $ refers to jQuery
[18:27:22] <shoky> PKKid: that is one way to make an IIFE
[18:27:41] <blast_hardcheese> PKKid: Anything can use $, it's just a variable
[18:27:54] <jamesdotnet> blast_hardcheese: If you're worried about the string of if-elses, I wouldn't be. (At least not yet.)
[18:27:55] <shoky> PKKid: the other more common way is:  (function($) { ... })(window.jQuery);   it's basically the same thing
[18:27:59] <PKKid> blast_hardcheese, Ahh, it makes so no one overrides $ with something else?
[18:28:04] <blast_hardcheese> PKKid: correct
[18:28:07] <shoky> and that
[18:28:18] <PKKid> shoky, Why but parens around the (function like that?
[18:28:34] <PKKid> ahh I see, so you can call it.
[18:28:38] <shoky> yea
[18:28:57] <blast_hardcheese> jamesdotnet: Well, I'm not concerned with a string of else-ifs, more... It looks ugly and hacky. Usually when I get to this point where I can't really explain what I'm trying to do and I come up with something terrible that does what I want, someone has already come up with a pattern and a name for it.
[18:29:06] <PKKid> blast_hardcheese, Does it also ensure code is not run until the DOM is done loading?
[18:29:21] <mattyhead> shoky, I should have mentioned that my this.id is not actually a this.id.  It's been lexically scoped.  That's why it was not relevant.
[18:29:22] <PKKid> or is that the other syntax: $(function() { ... }
[18:29:25] <blast_hardcheese> PKKid: No, that would be done either inside or outside of that function
[18:29:31] <blast_hardcheese> PKKid: That is correct
[18:29:34] <shoky> ejcweb: set a hidden input form's value to the string, i guess
[18:29:39] <PKKid> blast_hardcheese, Thanks.
[18:29:44] <blast_hardcheese> PKKid: No worries :)
[18:29:48] <shoky> ejcweb: but donno what you're sending exactly
[18:30:02] <shoky> mattyhead: yes, you should have mentioned that ;)
[18:30:43] <shoky> instead of "promising"
[18:31:06] <PKKid> I just learned about object.Create(xxx, {..}); and feel a great burden has been lifted in my understanding of inheritance in JS. :D
[18:31:28] <ejcweb> shoky: I'm sending (in my normal AJAX post request) a var that looks like ids = ['133543', '2463', etc]. I don't think a string representation of the list would be interpreted by the server in the same way?
[18:31:45] <blast_hardcheese> PKKid: Is that anything like $("<element />", {...}) ?
[18:32:02] <shoky> ejcweb: when you're sending a post request, you're sending a string representation anyway
[18:32:11] <shoky> ejcweb: ah , your whole data was that array?
[18:32:23] <PKKid> blast_hardcheese, Sort of, but built into JS, and it handles polymorphism better I believe.
[18:32:37] <ejcweb> shoky: No, there are a couple of other JSON properties I'm posting too.
[18:32:38] <shoky> ejcweb: eh sorry i mixed up some stuff
[18:33:11] <PKKid> blast_hardcheese, IE, if the parent element defines function foo(), but the child element doesn't, it will properly look up the to the parent (rather than copy it into the child).
[18:33:30] <blast_hardcheese> jamesdotnet: The reason I'm even jumping through these hoops is because sometimes my templates have other js includes, sometimes jquery plugins, which breaks conflicting jquery plugins
[18:33:40] <PKKid> I think I explained that correctly.
[18:33:56] <blast_hardcheese> PKKid: Inheritance?
[18:34:03] <PKKid> blast_hardcheese, yea
[18:34:24] <PKKid> blast_hardcheese, IIRC jquery does more of a copy, or extend.
[18:34:36] <blast_hardcheese> hmm
[18:34:40] <blast_hardcheese> neat
[18:35:03] <PKKid> I still have the page bookmarked, here: http://hughfdjackson.com/javascript/2012/01/05/prototypes:-the-short%28est-possible%29-story/
[18:35:54] <PKKid> He doesn't explain in that post that there is a second optional argument to Object.create, which lets you extend the newly created object with more stuff.
[18:36:36] <blast_hardcheese> PKKid: Neat-o
[18:37:02] <blast_hardcheese> What happens if you alter superobject properties? They're dynamically resolved I guess?
[18:38:16] <shoky> ejcweb: well you could dynamically create <input>s with appropriate names and values, but that's not very nice. cant think of a good way to do it right now
[18:38:35] <ejcweb> shoky: Sure, I guess I'll probably have to do that...
[18:40:33] <PKKid> So, who in the world tried to redefine $.  I thought jQuery pretty much owned that variable by now. :D
[18:41:36] <blast_hardcheese> PKKid: Plenty of other libraries, it's handy
[18:41:52] <blast_hardcheese> kind of like _, but easier to read
[18:41:57] <PKKid> tell those other guys to use # or something. :P
[18:42:10] <PKKid> underscore owns _. ;-P
[18:42:26] <PKKid> Maybe I should add that to my !function($) { line?
[18:46:48] <shokshok> blast_hardcheese:  is your .each meant to traverse only top level elements?
[18:47:04] <shokshok> blast_hardcheese: and, when you do self.target.html(good)  is self.target a jquery obj?
[18:47:37] <shoky> <
[18:47:42] <blast_hardcheese> shokshok: Not intentional, but that's currently all it does; self.target is
[18:47:54] <blast_hardcheese> shoky: gah, sneaky
[18:48:26] <shoky> blast_hardcheese: that code works?
[18:48:30] <blast_hardcheese> yep
[18:48:53] <blast_hardcheese> The problem is if I do $(data) (where data is HTML), it immediately fires off a bunch of xhr requests to load all required elements. Javascript, CSS, etc)
[18:48:55] <shoky> cause i don't see a version .html(...) that takes a jquery object/collection
[18:49:26] <blast_hardcheese> shoky: I tried it and it worked >_>
[18:49:29] <shoky> isn't that what you're doing there in that snippet?
[18:49:32] <blast_hardcheese> Yep
[18:49:37] <shoky> $(data) that is
[18:49:59] <blast_hardcheese> right. self.target.html($(data)), where $(data) is $([...])
[18:50:21] <shoky> what
[18:50:28] <blast_hardcheese> The reason I figured it'd work is $([]) is the type (prototype? kind?) of $(html).
[18:50:33] <blast_hardcheese> or rather, $(data)
[18:50:45] <blast_hardcheese> $(data) returns $([TextElement, <div />, etc])
[18:50:59] <shoky> data is just an html string, yea?
[18:51:03] <blast_hardcheese> Correct
[18:53:44] <blast_hardcheese> shoky: Slightly cleaner version: http://blast.hardchee.se/~/files/2012-08-29/loadTemplate_0.1.js
[18:54:23] <blast_hardcheese> Still works, logic is making more assumptions, but the goal is to make it easier for people to read so they can say "Oh! What you want is this instead!"
[18:55:08] <blast_hardcheese> I don't want to load all the resources until I am ready to add the resultant object to the DOM
[18:55:20] <blast_hardcheese> since I'm stripping out resources that shouldn't be loaded again
[18:57:09] <jamesdotnet> blast_hardcheese: I suppose you could use .filter() instead of .each() to remove the need for the ignore variable
[18:57:37] <blast_hardcheese> jamesdotnet: Oh right, forgot about filter, that's getting closer to reasonable
[18:58:32] <shoky> yeah i was just writing filter into it
[18:59:02] <jamesdotnet> blast_hardcheese: I was going to say the ideal solution would be to remove the need to filter at all, and then it clicked :)
[18:59:08] <shoky> blast_hardcheese: also i dont like your var good = $([]);   i'd do   var good = $(data).filter(function() { ... });
[18:59:25] <blast_hardcheese> shoky: roger that
[18:59:46] <shoky> blast_hardcheese: and at the end, self.target.empty().append(good);
[19:00:08] <shoky> but.. that still only iterates over top level elements
[19:00:08] <blast_hardcheese> shoky: awesome
[19:00:38] <blast_hardcheese> shoky: I could recurse over everything, but this is a short to medium-term solution
[19:00:45] <blast_hardcheese> so it /should/ be OK
[19:00:51] <shoky> well.. whatever your needs ;p
[19:01:10] <shoky> (you wouldn't need to write the recursion yourself, of course)
[19:01:12] <blast_hardcheese> I wish there was a doWhatIWant: true I could pass to $(data)
[19:01:59] <shoky> what do you mean
[19:02:13] <blast_hardcheese> An option to turn off loading external resources
[19:03:42] <shoky> well.. that's up to the browser
[19:03:58] <blast_hardcheese> really? I would have thought it was a jquery thing
[19:04:32] <shoky> nah
[19:04:35] <jamesdotnet> would $(data).find('*').filter(...) effectively traverse it all?
[19:04:59] <shoky> jamesdotnet: .find('*').andSelf().filter(...)
[19:05:12] <shoky> but that would get hairy with the resulting array..
[19:05:47] <shoky> it's not just a matter of filtering the top level elements.. here you should maybe .remove() the element from var $data = $(data)
[19:05:56] <shoky> and at the end just append $data
[19:06:23] <shoky> instead of building a new result
[19:06:30] <shoky> just drop what you dont want
[19:06:37] <blast_hardcheese> I tried that, iirc
[19:06:40] <blast_hardcheese> with .each()
[19:07:25] <blast_hardcheese> in order to search for objects, I added $(html) to a $("<div />"), but that loaded all required assets
[19:07:58] <shoky> it doesn't do it when you just call $(data)  ?
[19:08:12] <shoky> without appending it anywhere
[19:08:50] <danzik17> blast_hardcheese: out of curiosity, try creating a dom element ( not through jquery ), set its innerHTML to your html, then jquerify that dom element
[19:09:03] <shoky> danzik17: isn't that exactly what jquery does
[19:09:15] <shoky> which results in the automatic loading
[19:09:39] <danzik17> shoky: not sure.  id have to look in the constructor - it's the difference between parsing HTML and looking for resources, or looking at an existing DOM node
[19:09:55] <shoky> danzik17: setting .innerHTML _is_ parsing HTML
[19:10:43] <[2]tona> hello gyuys
[19:10:46] <shoky> unless im way mistaken
[19:10:51] <danzik17> shoky: but in this case, i'm letting the browser do it not jquery
[19:10:55] <blast_hardcheese> danzik17: I think it worked, actually
[19:11:00] <[2]tona> how can i get one value or pick one value one textbox html
[19:11:34] <danzik17> shoky: blast_hardcheese: so it worked because doing it in that manner bypasses using $.parseHTML to parse the HTML ( rather, allow the browser to do it )
[19:11:46] <danzik17> what the consequences of that are?  no idea, but was just a thought
[19:12:12] <blast_hardcheese> Yeah, this is perfect
[19:13:09] <shoky> oh
[19:13:15] <[2]tona> can someone guide me
[19:13:21] <shoky> parseHTML: function( data, context, scripts ) {
[19:13:22] <blast_hardcheese> Reduced to 5 lines, no confusion
[19:13:26] <blast_hardcheese> danzik17: You rock
[19:13:34] <shoky> // data: string of html  // scripts (optional): If true, will include scripts passed in the html string
[19:13:57] <blast_hardcheese> shoky: oh hell
[19:13:57] <blast_hardcheese> haha
[19:14:01] <danzik17> ah yea, so maybe you could manually use $.parseHTML and set scripts to false then
[19:14:08] <danzik17> new API, not too familiar with that one yet
[19:15:23] <blast_hardcheese> shoky: I really appreciate you working through this with me, this whole journey has been helpful
[19:15:34] <shoky> ;]
[19:16:31] <danzik17> shoky: you happen to know if thats a public api?  not finding docs for it on docs.jquery.com
[19:16:53] <blast_hardcheese> danzik17: I suspect he pulled it out of the source, considering the comments
[19:17:06] <blast_hardcheese> Something I should also do, since grep is easier than google
[19:17:24] <danzik17> blast_hardcheese: oh he did.  but if its public, it should be documented as well - was gonna file a bug against that
[19:17:32] <blast_hardcheese> gotcha
[19:18:33] <shoky> danzik17: it's on the blog pos
[19:18:36] <shoky> for 1.8
[19:18:44] <shoky> (not the actual API, just a mention that its public)
[19:19:10] <danzik17> shoky: yea i know it was included in this release, ( i lurk in dev all the time ).  went to read up on it on the docs site and there's nothing there
[19:19:11] <shoky> yeah i pulled that out of the source, but based on the short text in the blog post
[19:19:21] <danzik17> from the dev ticket, it *looks* public
[19:19:47] <w00tner> hellpp heellppp
[19:19:59] <w00tner> How do i set $.support.cors AND $.mobile.allowCrossDomainPages to true. and how do i decrease the delay of $.mobile.buttonMarkup.hoverDelay    ???
[19:20:04] <shoky> danzik17 well if the blog post says:  jQuery 1.8 introduces a new method: $.parseHTML.
[19:20:13] <danzik17> good point.
[19:20:32] <shoky> and also: For anything more than the simple case of creating single elements (e.g., $("<p/>")), and particularly for cases where strings are built from external data, we strongly recommend using $.parseHTML. As of jQuery 1.9, some HTML strings will no longer be recognized by $() as a result of these stricter rules.
[19:22:45] <danzik17> yep, filed it.
[19:22:51] <shoky> danzik17: and yea i know you lurk :) that's why i didnt think twice asking you smth like 'doesnt jquery do it internally' :P
[19:26:50] <MZAWeb> shoky: uhm interesting. doesn't seem to be any documentation for that method. is there anywhere (besides the code) where we can read about how it works?
[19:27:08] <w00tner> anyone ?
[19:33:28] <abjorn> :o
[19:33:39] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky :o
[19:33:39] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[19:33:44] <abjorn> bot-t: tell coldhead :o
[19:33:44] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[19:33:54] <abjorn> bot-t: tell gnarf :o
[19:33:54] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[19:34:09] <gnarf> huh?
[19:34:45] <abjorn> nothing, just bored, sup :D
[19:41:06] <oojacoboo> anyone know how I can determine if an iframe has finished loading?
[19:41:34] <oojacoboo> it's not crossDomain, so I can use js on the iframe side as well
[19:41:44] <oojacoboo> I need to show a loading gif
[19:43:03] <shoky> MZAWeb: as we've been discussing, we donno where to find anything better than that blog post (or the code) for now..
[19:43:29] <MZAWeb> shoky: oh, sorry, missed part of the discussion
[19:43:38] <MZAWeb> well, code it is :)
[19:43:49] <shoky> fun
[19:45:02] <coldhead> :O
[19:45:03] <bot-t> (11 mins 10 secs ago) <abjorn> tell coldhead :o
[19:45:24] <shoky> oojacoboo: you can use .load(...)
[19:45:42] <oojacoboo> shoky, that's after it's loaded, ey?
[19:46:31] <shoky> oojacoboo: yeah i think so. here's a fiddle i once made http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/gkbN5/
[19:48:03] <oojacoboo> yea… now I gotta find a way to put up an animated gif and replace it when it's finished loading cleanly
[19:48:10] <oojacoboo> I have a feeling I'm going to get some jumping around
[19:51:27] <shoky> oojacoboo: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/gkbN5/1/
[19:52:04] <shoky> of course, that .css(...) wouldnt be necessary if you had specified dimensions in css
[19:52:28] <oojacoboo> right, yea, I got the loader in, but the problem is it's position is suppose to be where the iframe is
[19:52:37] <oojacoboo> I guess I need to do some absolute madness :(
[19:53:00] <shoky> well, only if your frame is absolute too
[19:53:19] <oojacoboo> na it's relative, but the .load() isn't fast enough, which is what I figured
[19:53:30] <shoky> wat
[19:53:33] <oojacoboo> it comes into view just before I can remove the loading gif
[19:53:49] <martisj> what does use strict actually do?
[19:53:53] <shoky> me no understand
[19:54:28] <oojacoboo> shoky, I have a loading gif element before the <iframe> in the DOM, then on .load() I remove the loading gif element
[19:55:09] <oojacoboo> the iframe doesn't really appear, but of course the element is there, and when it loads, it actually starts loading in, before the js can remove the element for the loading gif, so you get a little bit of "sliding" going on
[19:55:41] <oojacoboo> I'd need to absolute position the loading gif over the top of the iframe
[19:56:59] <shoky> yeah.. didnt understand the sliding stuff tho
[19:57:19] <oojacoboo> well… it just remove the loading gif which causes it to look like it's sliding up
[19:57:28] <oojacoboo> the content loaded in the iframe that is
[19:57:41] <oojacoboo> obv it's just removing the loading gif
[19:57:56] <samholmes> How do I prevent click events from triggering with draggables?
[19:58:06] <oojacoboo> it's not that bad of an effect really
[19:58:16] <shoky> oojacoboo: you're removing the gif with a slide animation?
[19:58:28] <oojacoboo> shoky, na, it's just a fluke that it looks like a slide
[19:58:40] <shoky> k..
[19:58:49] <oojacoboo> browser painting and js height calculation of the iframe I'd guess
[19:59:40] <shoky> guess i gotta see it to get it
[20:12:45] <defaultro> is there something wrong with this code? var attributes = {}; attributes.speedlimit[0] =  parseInt(10);
[20:13:26] <Eviltwin> Yes
[20:13:33] <defaultro> oh
[20:13:35] <Eviltwin> attributes.speedlimit is undefined
[20:13:44] <Eviltwin> You can't use [...] on undefined
[20:13:45] <defaultro> how do I make it work?
[20:13:57] <defaultro> i need it to be formated that way
[20:13:58] <Eviltwin> attributes.speedlimit = [parseInt(10)];
[20:14:06] <defaultro> wow :D
[20:14:08] <defaultro> trying it now
[20:14:09] <Eviltwin> Build an array and put it there
[20:14:19] <defaultro> that code will make it an array?
[20:14:42] <Eviltwin> How new are you to JavaScript?
[20:15:03] <defaultro> few months
[20:15:11] <defaultro> but that kind of syntax is new to me
[20:15:22] <Eviltwin> You've not seen var x = [1, 2, 3] before?
[20:15:29] <defaultro> i do
[20:15:41] <defaultro> but not enclosing function with []
[20:15:48] <Eviltwin> So remove two of the items and you get var x = [1];
[20:15:50] <defaultro> but it makes sense now
[20:15:59] <Eviltwin> You can put any expression in there and it will be evaluated
[20:16:02] <defaultro> i don't think that is possible with php
[20:16:06] <defaultro> awesome
[20:16:18] <Eviltwin> It is
[20:16:21] <Eviltwin> I've done it before
[20:16:24] <Eviltwin> array(foobar());
[20:16:46] <defaultro> but not that kind of syntax
[20:17:45] <Eviltwin> array(intval(10))?
[20:17:53] <Eviltwin> w/e
[20:17:56] <Eviltwin> This isn't ##php
[20:18:12] <defaultro> wow, the data looks good
[20:18:29] <defaultro> hopefully, the insertion of object won't fail anymore :)
[20:18:36] <martisj> anyboyd using netbeans for javascript dev?
[20:18:48] <Eviltwin> No
[20:19:12] <martisj> i keep getting syntax errors in myt javascript and it doesn't give me any interesting information as to what is wrong :@
[20:19:21] <Eviltwin> defaultro: You can do var attributes = { speedlimit: [ parseInt(10) ] };
[20:19:35] <Eviltwin> martisj: Now you know why we don't use NetBeans
[20:20:05] <martisj> Eviltwin: HAHAHA :)
[20:20:05] <defaultro> cool
[20:20:15] <martisj> Eviltwin: what do you use ?
[20:20:23] <defaultro> thanks for the different approach, I'm learning from it :)
[20:20:25] <Eviltwin> It's this newfangled thing called emacs
[20:33:47] <postoy> hello
[20:33:58] <astropirate> Greeetings
[20:38:51] <oojacoboo> what's the url encode method?
[20:39:22] <oojacoboo> .param :/
[20:39:47] <oojacoboo> isn't there something cleaner for just a string
[20:39:58] <defaultro> Eviltwin, I got it to work :D
[20:40:13] <oojacoboo> I guess encodeURI
[20:42:56] <samholmes> I do I prevent a click event from draggable event?
[20:42:57] <VasiqMz> hi, i'm running a Jquery ajax function but it gives me an error of "Error" with no response code or anything
[20:43:01] <samholmes> I need to stop this draggin business.
[20:43:05] <samholmes> I mean clicking.
[20:43:16] <oojacoboo> samholmes, event.preventDefault()
[20:43:24] <samholmes> oojacoboo: nah that wont work
[20:43:34] <oojacoboo> event.stopPropagation();
[20:43:48] <samholmes> I have these photos that can be dragged to trash bins and albums etc, but they also have an event handle attached to them when they're clicked.
[20:43:51] <oojacoboo> samholmes, you have a fiddle
[20:43:53] <oojacoboo> it will work
[20:44:21] <samholmes> oojacoboo: isn't preventDefault for default browser behavior?
[20:44:45] <oojacoboo> yes
[20:44:56] <oojacoboo> you can stopPropagation though
[20:44:58] <VasiqMz> any help
[20:45:00] <oojacoboo> that will keep it from bubbling
[20:55:24] <samholmes> oojacoboo: You can't stop prop within draggables
[20:55:37] <samholmes> Also, making this fiddles is a bitch
[20:55:39] <oisa> What is the best way to start a span as hidden, so it can be toggled to visible? Should that be a document ready call, or css..?
[20:55:41] <samholmes> my code is large..
[20:56:10] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ samholmes
[20:56:10] <bot-t> samholmes, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[20:56:26] <oojacoboo> samholmes, http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Draggable#option-cancel
[20:56:30] <oojacoboo> is it an element within?
[20:56:35] <samholmes> Eviltwin: That's what's a bitch about it..
[20:57:05] <oojacoboo> also http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Draggable#option-handle
[20:57:06] <Eviltwin> You're right, it'd be so much easier for you to throw thousands of lines of code at us and have us find the problem for you instead
[20:57:09] <Eviltwin> So you don't have to do any work
[20:57:40] <oojacoboo> also, check out the events for draggable and write a function on create
[20:57:57] <oojacoboo> and on click shouldn't be using that, use onMouseUp maybe
[20:58:11] <samholmes> http://jsbin.com/ibixik/1/edit
[20:58:14] <samholmes> that's good enough
[20:58:20] <samholmes> Don't mind the HTML/CSS
[20:58:27] <samholmes> that's just stripped from my source.
[20:58:31] <samholmes> The main bits are in the JS
[20:59:20] <Eviltwin> Ah, I see the problem
[20:59:30] <Eviltwin> Too much code
[20:59:36] <oojacoboo> lol
[20:59:43] <samholmes> lol
[20:59:48] <samholmes> removed refresh
[21:00:26] <samholmes> I figure the draggables and droppables and the click event are relevent?
[21:01:11] <zduffy> Why if I put a line break in my html string, does it screw my border and box up? http://pastebin.com/k1Qcj8La
[21:01:20] <samholmes> Refresh again
[21:02:43] <samholmes> There, I reduced the CSS and HTML too
[21:03:23] <samholmes> Eviltwin: Still too much?
[21:04:50] <Eviltwin> samholmes: I don't want to touch jQuery UI with a ten-foot pool
[21:04:52] <Eviltwin> pole*
[21:05:04] <samholmes> Eviltwin: jQuery sucks then?
[21:05:09] <Eviltwin> Yes
[21:05:11] <samholmes> I should just write a custom drag and drop system
[21:05:19] <Eviltwin> Probably
[21:05:20] <samholmes> Or, is there a better plugin?
[21:08:19] <samholmes> Eviltwin: Even if I didn't use jquery ui, how would I solve the problem with drag and drop?
[21:08:49] <samholmes> stopPropagation doesn't work if the order for the click event is before the drag events.
[21:09:01] <oojacoboo> samholmes, do you need a click event on them?
[21:09:08] <oojacoboo> what are you trying to do?  That's the better question
[21:09:43] <samholmes> oojacoboo: I'm trying to prevent my popup script from acting when the dragging occurs on the element.
[21:09:54] <oojacoboo> popup script?
[21:10:07] <samholmes> oojacoboo: yeah, that's what the click event does.
[21:10:10] <oojacoboo> is this something set on all anchors?
[21:10:11] <samholmes> But that's not relevant.
[21:10:23] <oojacoboo> it is relevant b/c you can rethink what you're actually doing here
[21:10:24] <samholmes> oojacoboo: Not all anchors, just ones that have a popup-button class
[21:10:33] <oojacoboo> and these HAVE TO HAVE that class??
[21:10:46] <samholmes> oojacoboo: If they're going to be caught by the popup scripts, yes.
[21:10:52] <oojacoboo> ?!
[21:10:55] <samholmes> ??
[21:11:02] <oojacoboo> I thought you were trying to AVOID that??
[21:11:15] <samholmes> If the dragging occurs yes
[21:11:18] <samholmes> you see.
[21:11:23] <oojacoboo> why is that class needed on these drag and drop elements if that's what you're using as the event handler?
[21:11:31] <samholmes> if you were to drag an element, normally it doesn't count as a click event.
[21:11:49] <oojacoboo> samholmes, are you trying to accomplish something or just screw around?
[21:11:59] <oojacoboo> I got better shit to do than solve a non problem
[21:12:01] <samholmes> oojacoboo: accomplish something..
[21:12:10] <oojacoboo> so WHY CANT you remove the class??
[21:13:44] <samholmes> oojacoboo: The handlers will still be attached to the class
[21:13:49] <samholmes> I mean the element
[21:13:56] <samholmes> unless...I make it a de..
[21:13:56] <oojacoboo> for what reason?
[21:13:58] <samholmes> de..
[21:14:12] <samholmes> fuck, a live event.
[21:14:22] <samholmes> (old school jquery terminology)
[21:15:15] <oojacoboo> or you could add the class on the stop event for draggable
[21:15:18] <oojacoboo> if that's your goal
[21:15:50] <oojacoboo> anyway, I've lost interest
[21:16:29] <samholmes> hmm. I'll try the adding and remove of classes thing
[21:18:57] <samholmes> oojacoboo: It isn't over until the fat lady sings
[21:21:44] <Eviltwin> samholmes: http://jsfiddle.net/YNbF8/
[21:21:52] <Eviltwin> I don't want to touch draggable
[21:22:00] <Eviltwin> But you want to do something similar
[21:22:12] <Eviltwin> Set a flag on mousedown or at the end the click handler
[21:22:23] <Eviltwin> And an event on mousemove or whatever draggable move event there is
[21:22:40] <Eviltwin> That sets the flag the other way
[21:23:11] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin, I hate your var naming schemes :P
[21:23:26] <Eviltwin> Feel free to make better ones
[21:23:37] <oojacoboo> na, I'll pass, just sayin
[21:26:15] <Eviltwin> samholmes: The "moved" flag is the important one there
[21:26:32] <samholmes> oojacoboo: DUDE! Making the event delegated and remove the class worked! Thanky wanky!
[21:26:43] <samholmes> Eviltwin: But it worked!
[21:26:59] <oojacoboo> cool
[21:28:45] <samholmes> oojacoboo: isn't it?
[21:28:46] <samholmes>  :D
[21:29:21] <oojacoboo> yea, it helps to think about things differently sometimes
[21:31:57] <danzik17> pretty unrelated to jquery, but does anyone else get "TypeError: argument has to be an integer" when trying to use $0 in the console in recent versions of chrome/chromium?
[21:32:18] <therealfakemoot> I've got a button on my site that toggle sbetween two different font faces. There are two divs that I do not want to change, EVER. Is there some way to ignore them in the selector or otherwise protect them?
[21:32:28] <oojacoboo> danzik17, why would you be using that?
[21:32:44] <oojacoboo> many languages don't accept numbers to start a var
[21:33:17] <danzik17> oojacoboo: $0 is the currently selected element in chrome's elements window.  doing something like $( $0 ) for debugging was crazy useful until it broke recently
[21:33:35] <oojacoboo> ah
[21:33:54] <tw2113> same with firefox if i recall
[21:34:15] <samholmes> oojacoboo: yeah
[21:34:46] <samholmes> I think that the whole DOM model sucks for application development, and javascript is mainly going to be used to for application dev, soo...
[22:13:03] <azbyin> hi all.. say I do an ajax call and get returned an xml doc
[22:13:24] <azbyin> can i use jquery selectors within (and only inside) this xml doc?
[22:13:34] <astropirate> azbyin, yup
[22:13:41] <obert-> morning, do you have a suggestion to implement autofocus on form inputs?
[22:39:57] <LoneStar99> howdy folks
[22:41:08] <Eviltwin> And a late 'evening to you as well
[22:42:27] <LoneStar99> instead of one long horizontal list how can i divide it into rows of 5 until all data is displayed?
[22:43:02] <Eviltwin> That'd be where you use tables for layout
[22:43:24] <Eviltwin> Or floating if they're fixed sizes
[22:43:30] <LoneStar99> sorry one lone vertical list need rows of 5 horzintally
[22:44:02] <LoneStar99> Eviltwin: would you have an example of the loop needed for that?
[22:46:25] <Eviltwin> LoneStar99: http://jsfiddle.net/zNyWc/
[22:48:14] <LoneStar99> Eviltwin: yeah perfect thanls
[22:48:17] <LoneStar99> thanks
[22:48:25] <azbyin> astropirate, how would I use the jQuery or $ object on that particular document?
[22:49:10] <LoneStar99> perfect!
[22:52:14] <astropirate> azbyin, did you find the answere to your question?
[22:52:24] <azbyin> not really
[22:53:14] <astropirate> azbyin, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[22:54:43] <azbyin> ah, nice. i will try it out later
[23:08:47] <dark-sun> i want to replace 'foo' in <a href=''>foo</a>, any idea people?
[23:13:23] <onekt> .replace()?
[23:13:34] <onekt> lmgtfy.com?
[23:15:12] <dark-sun> onekt✪ did you mean replaceWith()?
[23:15:28] <dark-sun> that replaces whole tag
[23:15:46] <dark-sun> i dont want to rewrite <a...>bar</a>
[23:15:52] <dark-sun> again
[23:16:03] <dark-sun> i just want to replace 'foo' with 'bar'
[23:16:23] * dark-sun is googling now...
[23:17:36] <dark-sun> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/901909/change-html-text-from-link-with-jquery
[23:17:43] <dark-sun> guess i found it
[23:23:59] <therealfakemoot> Can I run a selector on a particular style definition? i.e. $([@style=font-family:X])?
[23:24:17] <therealfakemoot> It seems like querying the actual style attribute will give mixed results because it's a string
[23:33:10] <DivInt> Hi
[23:33:13] <gloomer> hi
[23:34:10] <DivInt> Made a website with one-page design using jquery to show/hide the different layers. How can I make the script links bookmarkable?
[23:35:47] <mazzachre> DivInt: Just parse the hashtags...
[23:36:11] <mazzachre> Or what they are called? For identifiers
[23:36:49] <DivInt> Err... I am not sure what you meant by that.
[23:37:41] <mazzachre> mypage.com/index.html#whereyouareonthepage
[23:38:19] <mazzachre> Then on load you show the #whereyouareonthepage part instead of the normal first page
[23:39:05] <mazzachre> The is the std. way of navigating  single document page (Which have been along since the early days of the net)
[23:40:18] <DivInt> but the # links dont reflect on the address bar if I am using calling javascript links. Do they?
[23:40:39] <mazzachre> DivInt: If you set them, they do
[23:40:57] <mazzachre> DivInt: It is afaik the recommended way of handling single page navigation
[23:41:05] <DivInt> this is the site: relaxarea.li
[23:41:39] <mazzachre> DivInt: There is a plugin (bbq) that will do all of this for you, but you can of cause handle it yourself
[23:41:51] <DivInt> Damn. Should I be setting return "true" instead of false?
[23:42:28] <therealfakemoot> Any chance you chaps know about selecting against styles declared on an element?
[23:42:44] <mazzachre> DivInt: Not nessecary, you can just add the stuff yourself
[23:43:12] <mazzachre> therealklanni: I don't think there is a selector... you might have to itterate through reading the css yourself..
[23:44:19] <mazzachre> therealklanni: The more you can refine your initial selector the faster it will be... but it is slow.. why would you even want to do that?
[23:45:18] <therealfakemoot> mazzachre: I've got a button on my page that toggles the entire page, excluding exactly two divs, between two different fonts.
[23:46:25] <therealfakemoot> And I don't want to iterate over every single elemtn in the page
[23:46:26] <mazzachre> therealklanni: Well, the easy way would be to define the fonts with classes in the css and then toggle those classes (with... toggleClass) but that would just be too easy? :)
[23:46:39] <therealfakemoot> hrm
[23:46:51] <cebor> hi i have juste done my first thing with jquery, a mini slidehsow, can somebody look on my code, to check what i have done is ok ? :) its only ~30 lines
[23:47:02] <jaket> nah bro
[23:47:02] <therealfakemoot> I'm explaining this terribly. I apologize.
[23:47:04] <therealfakemoot> Let me start over.
[23:47:19] <tw2113> $.reset()
[23:47:26] <DivInt> hahaha
[23:47:32] <DivInt> mazzachre: Is it possible for you to direct me to a website where this is implemented?
[23:47:53] <mazzachre> http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/docs/files/jquery-ba-bbq-js.html#jQuery.deparam.fragment read this :)
[23:48:14] <tw2113> oh the ole switcharoo
[23:48:19] <mazzachre> But there are a million ways to do this...
[23:48:21] <tw2113> instead of using jquery to set css
[23:48:27] <therealfakemoot> I've got a page with the font toggling button. There are two divs (logos, basically) that cannot have thier font changed.
[23:48:32] <tw2113> use it to set classes that are already defined with those styles
[23:48:39] <therealfakemoot> I'm trying to do this efficiently, without titerating over every single element in the page.
[23:48:55] <mazzachre> therealklanni: Read what tw2113 is writing :)
[23:48:58] <therealfakemoot> Oh
[23:48:59] <therealfakemoot> Sorry
[23:49:23] <mazzachre> therealklanni: It is how it is done really... Switch classes not css :)
[23:49:31] <mazzachre> Kind of make love not war :)
[23:49:35] <therealfakemoot> Right right
[23:49:48] <tw2113> mazzachre, don't oyu mean therealfakemoot
[23:49:58] <tw2113> you* even :D
[23:50:16] <therealfakemoot> Okay, so changing the class itself?
[23:50:20] <therealfakemoot> I'm not sure I exactly follow
[23:50:47] <mazzachre> therealfakemoot: http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[23:51:36] <mazzachre> tw2113: ya
[23:52:06] <mazzachre> tab complete is not always that fantastic :)
[23:55:10] <therealfakemoot> mazzachre: Okay, so that's a good solution to how to toggle the font. What's a good way to togglecss() on every element that has a font-family tag explicitly declared on it and not just cascaded down
[23:56:02] <mazzachre> therealfakemoot: Do not declare styles directly in tags... It is hell to maintain
[23:56:07] <therealfakemoot> Well
[23:56:09] <tw2113> therealfakemoot, http://jsbin.com/ezinip/1/edit
[23:56:09] <therealfakemoot> Hang on
[23:56:37] <therealfakemoot> Okay, there aren't any declared on the page.
[23:56:44] <therealfakemoot> no style attributes
[23:57:14] <mazzachre> therealfakemoot: Then.. uhm, what are you asking?
[23:57:24] <therealfakemoot> I'm not quite sure. Let me gather my thoughts.
[23:57:32] <tw2113> i tried that once
[23:57:37] <tw2113> i was bored again 5 seconds later
[23:57:56] <therealfakemoot> hah
