[01:51:21] <garethdaine> Hey folks I have this for a nav http://laravel.io/bin/Delyx but I want to check if the content of each .heading click is hidden and if they are all hidden sroll to the top of the page. Any ideas?
[02:02:34] <garethdaine> No worries, done it
[02:10:30] <AlexRussia> oh, did you remove or move javascript 101 from learn.jquery.com?
[02:10:52] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: I did
[02:11:17] <arthurvr> AlexRussia https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/commit/040038655107f781a12d0450b11d9005e6a0cfc8
[02:12:07] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: it was removed for different reasons.
[02:12:37] <AlexRussia> crap, I'd so like this :(
[02:14:46] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: It was too reference-like (which doesn’t fit in our long-term plans with the learning center), it
[02:15:17] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: Raw javascript tutorials will come back, but later.
[02:16:39] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: With our limited resources we now wanne focus on jQuery-specific content, there are enough good (better) javascript tutorials on the web.
[02:17:42] <mdev> I need to detect typing, and cut paste ni a textbox
[02:17:48] <mdev> to output results in realtime
[02:18:01] <arthurvr> what event are you using?
[02:18:03] <mdev> what's best way to detect changes for a textbox is there 1 way
[02:18:11] <mdev> or do I need to check bunch of different things
[02:18:16] <arthurvr> probably not the input event? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/input
[02:18:28] <arthurvr> which is the current best practice
[02:18:45] <mdev> thanks
[02:27:12] <mdev> also someone said something earlier I wanted your guys take on
[02:28:04] <mdev> <jumpman> you really shouldn't use jquery for animation if you can avoid it
[02:28:13] <mdev> <jumpman> CSS transitions & animations are tremendously more powerful (hardware acceleration - think on a factor of ten or more)
[02:28:16] <mdev> is that accurate?
[02:29:32] <arthurvr> mdev: jumpman: from the jQuery conf in Portland, awesome talk on the topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-5UYqn8v04
[02:29:54] <arthurvr> But making the choice always depends on your personal needs
[02:30:11] <mdev> thanks i'll check it out
[02:30:19] <arthurvr> mdev: You’re welcome!
[02:45:10] <AlexRussia> sorry of noob question: $("ul li") will select all <li> into <ul>?
[02:47:35] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: Ya!
[02:47:59] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: All li tags in all <ul> tags on your page
[02:48:51] <AlexRussia> arthurvr: I just read docs http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/#refining-amp-filtering-selections and for me it was not so clear :(
[02:49:07] <AlexRussia> arthurvr: but thx
[02:50:40] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: It’s exactly the system like css selectors
[02:50:58] <AlexRussia> hm, ok
[02:51:14] * AlexRussia noticed himself to learn more about css
[02:51:44] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: But I agree the page is open for improvements. I’ll forward the feedback to the rest of the team.
[02:52:36] <AlexRussia> arthurvr: cool :)
[03:01:54] <AlexRussia> oh
[03:02:14] <AlexRussia> arthurvr: stupid question, learn.jquery.com can be runned local without pain?
[03:02:35] <arthurvr> of course. (the pain depends on your local setup  ;-)-
[03:02:42] <arthurvr> ;-)
[03:02:44] <AlexRussia> :D
[03:02:51] <AlexRussia> it's pure js? @)@
[03:02:57] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: it isn’t.
[03:02:57] <AlexRussia> I mean
[03:03:14] <AlexRussia> it's generated dynamically on server side? @_@
[03:03:25] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: You’ll first need to setup a local wordpress instance, then using markdown we drop in pages
[03:03:31] <AlexRussia> oh
[03:03:33] <AlexRussia> ah
[03:03:49] <arthurvr> that setup allows us to have a nice deployment/updating system + everything in source control and open source
[03:04:02] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: if you need help setting it up, I can help you out
[03:04:25] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: just to read the articles, you don’t need the setup btw
[03:04:34] <AlexRussia> arthurvr: I am just not sure that's what...oh, really?
[03:04:48] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: yes, really :)
[03:05:04] <AlexRussia> arthurvr: how so?
[03:05:08] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: I can also help you out with that. :)
[03:05:13] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: let me explain.
[03:05:25] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: you just want to read, or also to modify stuff?
[03:05:34] <AlexRussia> just read, I hope :D
[03:05:51] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: you’re on unix?
[03:05:58] <AlexRussia> Just my cable not stable some time, yep
[03:06:03] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: mac/linux? or windows?
[03:06:09] <AlexRussia> em
[03:06:14] <AlexRussia> windows as unix? @)@
[03:06:20] <AlexRussia> sure linux
[03:06:21] <arthurvr> no… haha
[03:06:25] <arthurvr> perfect
[03:06:34] <AlexRussia> you may still ask me about *bsd next time ;)
[03:06:45] <AlexRussia> still/yet
[03:06:51] <AlexRussia> idk which word right :(
[03:06:55] <AlexRussia> also
[03:06:57] <AlexRussia> yes
[03:06:58] <AlexRussia> :D
[03:07:10] <AlexRussia> s/still/also/
[03:07:13] <arthurvr> just run this command (where you want it): git clone https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com.git && cd learn.jquery.com/page
[03:07:18] <Mark_2> anybody know what kind of jquery plugin this website uses for its menu? http://xetemplate.cafe24.com/nous#
[03:08:04] <AlexRussia> arthurvr: and index.html is like wrapper for iterface, which include some js magic which convert markdown in html jit?
[03:08:10] <AlexRussia> interface*
[03:08:29] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: nah, it isn't.
[03:08:37] * AlexRussia sad
[03:08:51] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: if you want to read the markdown files (in page/) locally, just use some kind of markdown client
[03:08:58] <arthurvr> ~viewer/parser
[03:09:01] <AlexRussia> oh, lol
[03:09:03] <AlexRussia> hahaha
[03:09:08] <AlexRussia> let me...
[03:09:09] <arthurvr> it’s just markdown :)
[03:09:54] <arthurvr> if you’re interested in the wordpress setup: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content and https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content
[03:09:54] <AlexRussia> pandoc -f markdown -t html somerandomdoc.md | w3m -T text/html
[03:10:00] <AlexRussia> something like that I think :D
[03:10:12] <arthurvr> Something like that.
[03:10:32] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: Or use something like http://remarkableapp.net/
[03:10:53] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: works? :)
[03:11:25] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: You can do the same thing with every site (expect the api site, which has kind of a different setup)
[03:11:31] <AlexRussia> arthurvr: vim keys supported? :D
[03:11:44] <AlexRussia> vi*
[03:11:52] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: I dunno =)
[03:11:56] <AlexRussia> arthurvr: so, no :D
[03:12:12] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: Was just giving an example, think you’ve got the point
[03:12:23] <AlexRussia> arthurvr: I think, I've got lol
[03:12:24] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: having all docs ready to use locally is really handy
[03:12:26] <AlexRussia> :D
[03:13:01] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: You’re welcome! :)
[03:13:21] <AlexRussia> lol
[03:13:25] <AlexRussia> I just thinking....
[03:14:02] <AlexRussia> Oh, no, I think, vim doesn't support something like Real Nice View of text, except playing with colors....
[03:14:19] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: Vim is like awesome for everything :)
[03:14:45] <AlexRussia> said man which tried to push in me some kind of gui editor....
[03:15:09] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: because some don’t like reading raw markdown :)
[03:15:35] <AlexRussia> arthurvr: sure, use pandoc :P
[03:16:15] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: the api site looks something like this, so probably not something you’re going to read right in your text editor :)

[03:18:46] <AlexRussia> arthurvr: can I ask, what the *ucking window manager do you use?
[03:18:56] <AlexRussia> arthurvr: or it's osx?
[03:19:03] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: it’s osx
[03:19:31] <fuse405> can someone have a look at http://fpaste.scsys.co.uk/461336
[03:19:33] <AlexRussia> arthurvr: so, I am not much like this theme of buttons in left upper corner
[03:19:42] <AlexRussia> arthurvr: it's seems unnatural :(
[03:19:44] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: it’s raw os x
[03:19:57] <AlexRussia> arthurvr: lol, raw, haha, vim now going with osx? :D
[03:20:03] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: osx looks like that these days
[03:20:25] * AlexRussia trying save his eyes in black fluxbox
[03:20:37] <AlexRussia> oh, yep
[03:21:09] <arthurvr> fuse405: it’s this rule: $("#msg2").(data);
[03:21:25] <arthurvr> fuse405: should probably be $("#msg2").text(data);
[03:21:31] <arthurvr> or something like that
[03:21:58] <AlexRussia> arthurvr: http://i.imgur.com/PaqSmPx.png
[03:22:27] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: your vim doesn’t look that bad :)
[03:22:42] <AlexRussia> arthurvr: that like what?
[03:23:26] <AlexRussia> arthurvr: I'd just add some....powerline crap, this python gui shit for everything...can't live without it more :D
[03:23:56] <arthurvr> AlexRussia: Ya - powerline’s nice (but maybe we have to keep the discussion jquery focussed :-))
[03:24:09] <AlexRussia> arthurvr: lol, I'd got come think: not vim into window, it's window around vim :D
[03:24:29] <AlexRussia> arthurvr: okay, what do you see in my vim?(4 letters)
[03:24:48] <arthurvr> sorry but really afk for a while :)
[03:24:56] * AlexRussia start laughing outside this channel

[03:56:50] <esko> hi guys, i used this to bind to the checked state of checkboxes but how would i go about with this to be able to "check" multiple tags from the click event? http://jsfiddle.net/eskobaba/eyg1ce4t/1/
[03:58:58] <esko> could be buttons as well dont have to be links, but not checkboxes its ugly =)
[03:59:39] <esko> im trying to make a list of tags that i can select mutliple of and it will show me the divs that correspond to that id.
[03:59:49] <arthurvr> esko: what’s the expected behaviour? To hide all links where you didn’t click on?
[04:00:36] <esko> if i click on basic it will show me the divs that have basic as id, if i click on math as well i would like to get basic+math
[04:00:54] <esko> like so: http://jsfiddle.net/eskobaba/eyg1ce4t/
[04:01:12] <esko> but with buttons or links
[04:01:15] <arthurvr> oh that way. Let me fiddle together
[04:07:33] <esko> thanks arthurvr =) i find it the easiest way to ask here when im stuck, im trying to get back into js and jquery, my last experiences with js is from around 2000 :) things changed :D
[04:10:33] <arthurvr> esko: quickly having a call with somebody, I’ll be back in 10 minutes
[04:12:41] <arthurvr> esko: is this what you need? http://jsbin.com/wogavowaya/1/edit?html,js,output
[04:17:37] <esko> arthurvr yes but i need to bind to some clicked event so that i can select two buttons at the same time
[04:17:45] <esko> or multiple rather
[04:18:06] <arthurvr> UXers would complain about using buttons then
[04:18:20] <arthurvr> That’s not where buttons are made for
[04:18:23] <esko> well no need for buttuns, but dont want checkboxes
[04:18:35] <esko> links would do
[04:18:52] <arthurvr> esko: k. working on new bin
[04:31:48] <arthurvr> esko: here you go http://jsbin.com/zopadevuzi/1/edit?js,console,output
[04:33:53] <viran> hey, i select multiple spans using $(.myspan), I'd like to check if any of the spans contains a specific string..... how can I compare the .text() of each of the returned span's ?
[04:34:50] <arthurvr> viran: fiddling something for you
[04:35:04] <viran> thanks
[04:36:45] <arthurvr> viran: you want something like a search box?
[04:37:27] <viran> no, I just need to boolean value if any of my spans contains a specific string
[04:37:52] <viran> how do I iterate through all of their .text() values?
[04:38:20] <arthurvr> viran: example http://jsbin.com/rifutujayo/1/edit?js,output
[04:39:32] <viran> Thanks :)
[04:40:07] <arthurvr> `api each @ viran
[04:40:08] <b-ot> viran: .each(): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element.  http://api.jquery.com/each/
[04:40:13] <arthurvr> was the only thing you needed :)
[04:41:53] <viran> yep, thanks again
[04:43:05] <arthurvr> esko: was that last example what you needed?
[04:58:52] <MOUD> Hey all
[04:59:05] <arthurvr> hi MOUD
[04:59:13] <MOUD> hello arthurvr
[05:02:58] <MOUD> I want to make an image display like this:  http://www.starplugins.com/cloudzoom  but I also want the option to show the image when I hover like this: http://www.starplugins.com/cloudzoom/examples (the Hover option)
[05:05:45] <esko> back ;) had to fetch some beers.
[05:06:09] <MOUD> wb esko
[05:06:50] <MOUD> Here's the best example. I need the images to do the exact things like this: http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Hot-sales-For-Original-Samsung-Galaxy_60131087967.html?s=p
[05:07:28] <MOUD> Mouse over and do image loading, and also zooming
[05:10:12] <esko> arthurvr: exactly, how would i go about to be able to deselect it?
[05:13:18] <arthurvr> esko: don’t have the time to work on it right now, sorry. Can’t be difficult, tho
[05:14:59] <esko> no worries i'll fix it, thanks for the input
[05:25:22] <MOUD> If I have an image (large size), how can I make the browser generates two other smaller sized ones and use them automatically?
[05:46:55] <Jayden> Probably the worst place to ask this, but is there any php people here?
[05:47:04] <Jayden> Cant find any irc channels that are php related
[06:25:29] <jesmith> I am displaying badges on a page, and I need to use an ajax call to retrieve the value at page load. How do I bind an ajax call to page load?
[06:27:48] <Getty> ok serious question......... spinning loading symbol as favicon, chrome, doesnt go away....
[06:28:24] <Getty> i saw some post that say that its related to ajax requestes fired up DIRECTLY on page loaded event, which leads to chrome thinking its still loadtime
[06:28:39] <Getty> but when i rearranged my stuff and just said "ok i dont do the ajax request after page load" i STILL get the loading symbol
[06:28:49] <Getty> it drives me MAD
[06:29:28] <Getty> what are other directions, or cases, you people encountered? had the same problem once?
[06:30:29] <arthurvr> Getty: it can be related to ajax, however be sure to check you server-side setup first
[06:30:42] <arthurvr> Getty: It’s generally a never-ending response
[06:32:22] <Getty> arthurvr: well in THIS case this is pretty hard...... but i check the debugging output.... (this is ACTUALLY running on an ARM)
[06:32:39] <Getty> but .... i think i remember that it also happens often on the simulator, which is real webserver, let me recheck that
[06:32:48] <marchelzo_> Hi there. Would anyone be willing to explain to me why this is not working? http://jsfiddle.net/nnnq1074/
[06:33:22] <marchelzo_> I want the color to fade to white over 1 second after the mouse leaves the box.
[06:33:37] <Getty> arthurvr: yeah it seems you are right, didnt checked that really yesterday, but on the simulator it works out all fine, its just on the ARM...
[06:45:41] <arthurvr> marchelzo_: that’s quite easy
[06:45:46] <arthurvr> marchelzo_: check the api docs
[06:45:57] <marchelzo_> yeah I had to use jQuery UI
[06:45:59] <marchelzo_> my bad
[06:46:00] <arthurvr> ”For example, width, height, or left can be animated but background-color cannot be”
[06:47:47] <arthurvr> marchelzo_: ^^
[06:47:51] <arthurvr> I didn’t point to jQuery UI
[06:54:55] <Getty> We didnt start the fire.... <sing>
[06:55:26] <Getty> so who wants to fix my webserver now and finds out what i dont close right? ;) hehe
[06:56:25] <arthurvr> Getty: don’t search for something like that in specific. Every never ending action can cause this.
[06:56:38] <marchelzo_> Is it normal for mouseover events to not be triggered sometimes?
[06:57:07] <Getty> arthurvr: well let me show you what i worked on the last week, and i bet you will agree that it IS the webserver ;)
[06:57:38] <arthurvr> marchelzo_: fiddle?
[06:57:40] <Getty> arthurvr: https://gist.github.com/Getty/7ffcedb6b2528807b446
[06:58:33] <arthurvr> Getty: I only speak few words of C man, sorry, maybe somebody else?
[06:59:08] <Getty> arthurvr: nah i can help myself, i just dont want to, i just woke up, and shit, and didnt expected the problem being in the C still
[06:59:21] <Getty> arthurvr: since yesterday the complete shit at least delivers out what i wanted!
[06:59:35] <arthurvr> Getty: :-D
[07:00:07] <Getty> Its really fun to make this happen, lifting a powerful rich webapplication with a 64K RAM ARM.....
[07:01:33] <Getty> its so funny to see that i need 95% of my time on this project just to make a fucking webserver work
[07:01:46] <marchelzo_> arthurvr: nevermind. the mouseover event was triggered. There is an error in another place.
[07:01:51] <Getty> ok ok not that extreme, but its intense
[07:02:16] <marchelzo_> Why does everything in javascript have to fail silently
[07:02:32] <Getty> marchelzo_: there are JS scripts which allow you to "see" live action style what actually gets triggered
[07:02:37] <arthurvr> marchelzo_: nothing fails silently if you use the tools right.
[07:02:52] <marchelzo_> Not just JS, but DOM manipulation in general.
[07:03:01] <arthurvr> marchelzo_: same thing
[07:03:28] <arthurvr> marchelzo_: so much awesome tooling, and everybody forgets to use those
[07:04:11] <marchelzo_> Like, I generated a random color by generating a number from 0-255 and using toString(16) on it for each of rgb. But it doesn't have leading 0s, so when I got colors like #a47e2, it would just do nothing and I thought it was failing.
[07:04:30] <marchelzo_> What tooling can tell me that I'm setting somethings color to a garbage value?
[07:05:31] <Getty> well you could wrap the color setting functions to throw an aerror if the target value is out of color ranges
[07:05:48] <Getty> there is always a way to go
[07:05:56] <arthurvr> marchelzo_: chrome devtools crosses invalid css property values
[07:06:07] <Getty> yeah but then he has to scroll through all of them
[07:06:26] <Getty> and differ from those stroke through just cause of overridden
[07:06:55] <marchelzo_> Plus they fade out when I mouse out. The way I figured it out was console.logging the random color whenever one of the mouseover events happened.
[07:07:33] <arthurvr> nope, since you just manipulated those elements they get highlighted, in the side panel with CSS properties the latest manipulated values are (generally) displayed at the top
[07:07:34] <Getty> they hate us cause they aint us.... thats what the fade wanna tell you
[07:22:08] <Diabhs> How can I use jquery to changeg a pages css from another page?
[07:22:43] <arthurvr> Diabhs: What do you exactly want to do? And more importantly, why?
[07:23:11] <Diabhs> On the main page I have two divs, one hidden and one shown
[07:23:59] <Diabhs> I want to be able to change which div is shown on that page from another page so I dont have write an entire new page.
[07:24:31] <Getty> arthurvr: you know whats annoying..... chrome is not showing me on the console WHICH bastard is it that hangs
[07:24:53] <arthurvr> Getty: why isn’t it?
[07:25:28] <arthurvr> Getty: and more importantly, why would you need the console therefor?
[07:26:07] <Getty> arthurvr: well it must be some specific case and i cant see which. When i test with other methods, i clearly get an end of the connections (like testing with curl)
[07:26:21] <Getty> arthurvr: in GENERAL my code is probably right, but i might hit some stupid case
[07:26:54] <arthurvr> Getty: weird. That’s weird. Might be a third party too? Or indeed, an ajax call, but that’s quite unlikely.
[07:27:09] <Getty> no no i took them all away, there are no ajax calls
[07:27:09] <arthurvr> Getty: You’ve got a URL for me to check?
[07:27:34] <Getty> i could give you proxy to directly access the ARM, then you can see it yourself, the question is if the proxy is not changing the behaviour in between, gimme a sec
[07:27:46] <Diabhs> I think i might just write another new page
[08:14:30] <lack3r> Hi guys. I'm totally new to jquery. Can somebody help me to understand a piece of code in jquery
[08:14:38] <lack3r> ?
[08:14:43] <arthurvr> lack3r: I probably can
[08:14:55] <arthurvr> lack3r: paste in somewhere in a jsfiddle/bin/pastebin
[08:15:45] <lack3r> @arthurvr :) thanks. I'll do it now
[08:16:37] <lack3r> arthurvr: here it is: https://www.pastevault.com/view/5c5b5878bdd7202423f23bd14332eb9b
[08:16:42] <lack3r> the password is 1234
[08:17:18] <lack3r> It's taken from the website mentioned at pastevault
[08:17:48] <arthurvr> lack3r: ok. not that difficult. It’s a call to $.extend with 2 objects passed: the object you see and the variable ‘handlers’. If handlers doesn’t exist it uses an empty object.
[08:17:59] <arthurvr> `api jQuery.extend @ lack3r
[08:17:59] <b-ot> lack3r: jQuery.extend(): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[08:20:45] <lack3r> hmmm... thanks. So just to see if I understood correctly:
[08:22:08] <lack3r> An element handlers is created. That element merges the contents of handlers OR nothing with the events show, hide or commit
[08:22:49] <lack3r> and in the case those events are triggered the corresponding "showFoo","hideFoo", "commitFoo" is executed?
[08:23:00] <lack3r> Am I right?
[08:23:41] <lack3r> Sorry if this is confusing for you. I am just trying to understand a few things
[08:24:47] <lack3r> @arthurvr
[08:25:31] <arthurvr> no the showFoo, hideFoo and commitFoo are just already existing functions
[08:25:44] <arthurvr> that get assigned to the handlers object
[08:29:04] <lack3r> ok. so if I have a button that is supposed to show something: the function "ShowFoo" should be executed. By adding the showFoo to the handlers object, what do I gain? Is there an advantage for me? And then how do I make sure that ShowFoo will be executed when a button "show" is clicked?
[08:30:47] <lack3r> @arthurvr
[08:43:49] <arthurvr> lack3r: sorry man, I’m afk for a while. I really have to commit something big today, so no time. Somebody will be glad to help you out?
[08:45:32] <Terminus> hello. i'm trying to get jqueryte to format text in such a way that i get <p><span>FOO</span>BAR</p>. is that possible?
[08:47:02] <lack3r> Thanks a lot arthurvr :) You helped me a lot!
[08:51:23] <BillCriswell> Terminus: I don't know what jqueryte is...
[08:51:38] <BillCriswell> but what html do you have and what html do you need?
[08:52:33] <Terminus> BillCriswell: it's an html editor. i just want it to output html the way i mentioned so i can style the spans individually later on.
[08:53:19] <Terminus> BillCriswell: the demo for it -> http://jqueryte.com/demos
[08:53:45] <FickX4> AlexRussia, i know this was like 5 hours ago but i got the HTML injection working
[08:54:08] <xinming> When we use $._data(..., 'events') to see events bind to dom in jquery.
[08:54:22] <FickX4> turns out i was using http instead of https in the @include
[08:55:01] <xinming> I saw there is an array for a event, is the event in array will be fired first in order or reversed order please?
[08:55:26] <BillCriswell> Terminus: I would just switch to the source view. Not sure how you'd to it through the wysiwyg.
[08:56:14] <Terminus> BillCriswell: that doesn't help users. the entire point of using it is to have a WYSIWYG editor for them.
[08:58:04] <BillCriswell> WYSIWYG is normally a pretty shitty use experience to begin with.
[08:59:15] <BillCriswell> Is there options for that dropdown for stylinig that allows you to add your own?
[08:59:46] <Terminus> BillCriswell: yes there is but it works on a per-line basis. it will format the entire line.
[09:00:16] <Terminus> BillCriswell: i guess i'll just use <b> as a hack instead. not ideal semantically but it'll work for what i need.
[09:00:42] <BillCriswell> Got ya.
[09:04:00] <lack3r> Hi guys. I'm totally new to jquery. Can somebody help me to understand a piece of code in jquery?
[09:04:07] <lack3r> here it is: https://www.pastevault.com/view/5c5b5878bdd7202423f23bd14332eb9b
[09:04:11] <lack3r> the password is 1234
[09:09:58] <shoky> lack3r: it creates that object with the 3 method properties, then copies any properties from handler (if there are any) into that object, then assigns the result back to handler
[09:10:30] <lack3r> Thanks a lot shoky
[09:11:43] <lack3r> Is the "show : showFoo" a method property? And what does exactly that means?
[09:13:35] <shoky> "show" is a property of an object, its' value is showFoo. assuming that showFoo is a function, it's proper to call "show" a method of the object. so it's a property that is a method
[09:18:08] <lack3r> shoky: In this case is an object a button or a section of a site? And as that code does not explicitly state the name of the object those methods belong to, how do the right function gets executed when that button is clicked?
[09:18:33] <shoky> lack3r:  an object is a javacsript object, such as  {}  or  {foo: showFoo}
[09:18:48] <shoky> has nothing to do with elements in the DOM
[09:19:39] <shoky> lack3r: that code doesn't set any event handlers anywhere, it just creates a javascript object that refers to those 3 functions (and whatever was previously in handlers). that code doesn't call those functions or cause them to be called
[10:31:29] <Getty> that awkward moment where you look at a comment you made for yourself and you have no idea what you are talking about
[10:35:54] <tables> how can i load an external webpage into a div?
[10:36:28] <tables> and if i do this, can the webmaster tell if i loaded their webpage into a div?
[10:36:50] <Snerf> tables, an iframe, and yes then can
[10:37:03] <Snerf> but ppl rarely check
[10:37:27] <tables> how about a div, not an iframe?
[10:38:22] <Snerf> then you have great problems, because of the same origin policy
[10:39:23] <Snerf> easier to put an iframe in a div
[10:39:44] <tables> but the webhost can tell if i put that page in an iframe
[10:39:48] <tables> i want them to be unable to tell
[10:39:51] <tables> if i put it somewhere
[10:39:55] <tables> make it look like i browsed it
[10:40:33] <Snerf> you still ahve to "browse" the webpage in order to get its contents
[10:40:58] <Getty> ha, now i know what i meant
[10:41:06] <tables> can they tell that i put it in a div though?
[10:41:17] <tables> how do they tell if i loaded that webpage in an iframe?
[10:41:19] <Getty> they cant differ if its a div or an iframe
[10:41:28] <Snerf> tables, it would be no different then if you put it in an iframe
[10:41:32] <Getty> they just see by the referer of the browser that your page sucks in his
[10:41:42] <tables> i see
[10:41:51] <tables> are there any other headers or attributes that can tell?
[10:41:58] <Snerf> and if they dont want you getting their contents, then dont get their contents :) they can block you
[10:42:16] <Getty> actually if i think about it, they cant differ even if its just a regular call from a link from your page to his page
[10:42:22] <Snerf> tables, what you are being is shady, if they dont want you getting/displaying their contents
[10:42:39] <tables> i just wanna know
[10:42:40] <tables> lol
[10:42:44] <tables> even for security purposes
[10:42:50] <Getty> just dont fuck up the internet ;)
[10:42:52] <tables> if someone loads my webpage in an iframe, how can i tell?
[10:42:56] <Getty> its totally illegal
[10:43:13] <Getty> well you can see the referers on your webpage logfile and then check them back
[10:43:19] <Getty> and see how the "linK" is made
[10:43:31] <Snerf> yup, all has to do with referrers
[10:43:36] <tables> what would it look like in the referrers?
[10:43:44] <Getty> just your url
[10:43:44] <tables> nothing else but referrers would tell if it came from an iframe or a div?
[10:43:47] <Snerf> read up on headers :)
[10:43:50] <Getty> the referer would be your url of your page
[10:44:21] <Snerf> you would have to be specifically looking for it though, people dont just know off hand
[10:45:23] <Getty> snerf: depends on the content holder, in germany many are checking this pretty intense, its just easy to get money out of this
[10:46:04] <Snerf> yes, but they are "checking"
[10:46:28] <Snerf> you have to look specifically for it
[10:46:30] <Getty> oh and dont forget that they can EASILY cut it off
[10:46:38] <Getty> its one second and you are out, if they really care about it
[10:46:44] <Snerf> yup, easy to cut you off :)
[10:46:52] <Getty> i would actually not cut you off
[10:46:59] <Getty> just like 50% your requests doesnt give anything
[10:47:06] <Getty> so that you really get mad on this
[10:47:07] <Snerf> loading it in a div, or in an iframe, it makes no difference
[10:47:16] <Getty> AND linking to it
[10:47:19] <Getty> same no difference
[10:47:30] <Getty> they _CANT_ differ from a normal link really (beside checking what is loaded else)
[10:47:36] <Snerf> well, a link would then opne it on their own site
[10:47:43] <Getty> yeah but its still the exactly same request
[10:47:49] <Getty> your url with the referer of the thief
[10:48:08] <Getty> of course it ends up requesting all the assets and stuff, but by logfile lines its no difference
[10:48:17] <tables> what would the referrer tag look like if a page has been loaded into an iframe?
[10:48:20] <Getty> i mean you get that one line which is identical in all 3 cases
[10:48:23] <Getty> the same
[10:48:25] <Getty> its all the same
[10:48:40] <Getty> taking it via JS and injecting it to div, using it in an iframe, and linking to it => all 3 the same
[10:55:18] <tables> what would the referrer tag look like though?
[10:55:21] <tables> if a page has been loaded in iframe
[10:55:39] <tables> as a server admin i want to know if my pages are being loaded in iframes
[10:55:59] <Getty> its the URL of your page
[10:56:06] <Getty> you really should read up about HTTP on wikipedia
[10:56:08] <Getty> SO MANY INFOS! :D
[10:56:30] <Getty> HTTP Headers might be a good start for your question area
[10:56:36] <Getty> but its never bad to read the main HTTP article itself
[10:56:42] <tables> Referrer: http://www.myurl.com/myurl ?
[10:56:43] <Getty> its really big knowledge and understandment
[10:56:44] <tables> like that?
[10:56:45] <tables> kinda like that?
[10:56:51] <Getty> yeah
[10:57:14] <tables> so if i load www.yahoo.com into an iframe in http://www.myurl.com/myurl
[10:57:20] <tables> the referrer thatg would be
[10:57:22] <tables> Referrer: http://www.myurl.com/myurl ?
[10:57:25] <Getty> yes
[10:57:30] <tables> cool
[10:57:43] <tables> any other distinguishing features when my page is loaded into an iframe?
[10:57:45] <tables> besides referrer
[10:57:59] <Getty> ............
[10:58:09] <Getty> read up the articles ;) really ;)
[10:58:11] <tables> referrer is the only one?
[10:58:24] <tables> can't a link do the same thing?
[10:58:36] <Getty> as i said above, yes, a link has the same referer as result
[10:58:41] <tables> so loading into iframe looks just like from a link?
[10:58:53] <Getty> not in all detail, but that ONE request looks idenitcal
[11:00:03] <Getty> even tho in iframe case its all identical, beside the JS (many sites have JS that prevents getting loaded inside iframe and just "stop" the page)
[11:03:43] <tables> i see
[11:06:01] <steelbrain> Anyone up?
[11:25:50] <v0lksman> hello all!  is it possible to determine the bottom of an elements position?
[11:27:00] <v0lksman> top plus height
[11:27:02] <v0lksman> hrm
[11:49:40] <tables> http://paste2.org/_W7AOBIDE   <-- why isn't this working?  it's not showing microsoft.com
[12:04:33] <Azrael_-> hi
[12:06:37] <Azrael_-> i want to find an element in this schema <tr><td class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></td></tr> how can i do this with find? similar to this: trRowVar.find('.c1 .c2')  ?
[12:08:58] <ExtraSteve> tables: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14999573/jquery-load-external-site-page
[12:09:10] <ExtraSteve> Essentially that's XSS
[12:09:23] <ExtraSteve> And your browser isn't gonna like that
[12:09:33] <tables> if i use that method, can the server admin tell that i loaded their page in a div?
[12:10:19] <ExtraSteve> Not sure what kind of referrer trail it'd leave, but I'm guessing it'd look like an <iframe>
[12:10:29] <ExtraSteve> Which means it'd have a referrer
[12:10:58] <ExtraSteve> So the admin could at least see where the request came from - but not necessarily that it was in a <div> vs a <span> vs an <iframe>
[12:11:57] <ExtraSteve> Either way, cross domain policy is somethign that your browser is gonna yell at you fo
[12:11:59] <ExtraSteve> *for
[12:12:10] <ExtraSteve> Best to avoid it
[12:12:19] <ExtraSteve> Or restructure your code so you don't need to deal with it
[12:13:30] <Azrael_-> ExtraSteve: mind to give me also a hint?
[12:13:46] <ExtraSteve> Azrael_-: I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to do...
[12:14:04] <ExtraSteve> And you might wanna pastebin some of your code too :)
[12:14:25] <ExtraSteve> I don't mind helping, but I'd like to avoid thinking if possible :p
[12:14:46] <Azrael_-> i've got the row in a variable and wanted to avoid .find('.c1').find('.c2')  is there a way to accomplish this with just one find?
[12:15:53] <Azrael_-> hope this is understandable
[12:16:14] <ExtraSteve> You could use nested "parent > child" syntax
[12:16:28] <ExtraSteve> look up jquery selectors - specifically parent/child: https://api.jquery.com/child-selector/
[12:16:44] <Azrael_-> k, thanks
[12:16:44] <ExtraSteve> jquery has OODLES of ways to use selectors
[12:17:03] <Azrael_-> yeah, and the oodles are tricky
[12:17:14] <ExtraSteve> Agreed
[12:17:20] <ExtraSteve> It can be a bit overwhelming sometimes
[12:17:28] <ExtraSteve> Especially if you're new to it
[12:17:34] <ExtraSteve> After a while it'll be second nature though :)
[12:18:00] <ExtraSteve> Here's the full list, Azrael_-: https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[12:18:37] <Azrael_-> i know the basics but i didn't think you could use the child-selector also for classes, only saw it until now for dom-elements
[12:18:48] <Azrael_-> like td > input
[12:19:48] <ExtraSteve> I'm pretty sure you can... I've never done it personally, but I'm guessing you can just do $('.c1 > .c2').stuff()
[12:20:16] <ExtraSteve> Don't see why you couldn't if you're allowed to do 'elm.class'
[12:21:14] <ExtraSteve> And if not, then slap me silly and call me BadAdviceBot
[12:21:17] <Azrael_-> yeah, i guessed the same :)
[12:55:00] <asdf12z_> can someone tell me what's being used here for... $(ele).on('click', { 'test': func }); ?
[12:55:14] <asdf12z_> what is { 'test': func } ?
[12:56:09] <asdf12z_> or specifically how do i trigger that event?
[12:58:09] <asdf12z_> i'm guessing it's the second definition http://api.jquery.com/on/ of events param, but i don't know why there's 2 params 'click' and a object
[12:59:51] <jaydev> hi
[13:25:38] <BlueProtoman> Does JQuery support manipulations on SVG elements?
[13:27:31] <slolp22> hi. Can anyone help me with this http://pastebin.com/vuaUWT6s ? thanks!

[13:37:20] <IgnitedGeek> http://laravel.io/bin/yGKYR I have a datatable that I am dynamically adding rows to.. With the current code, it initializes the first row thats already displayed, but when i add a row the first added row does not initialize the typeahead, however row #3+ all initialize correctly. Any suggestions?
[13:39:09] <ExtraSteve> Azrael_-: I'm glad :)
[13:39:19] <IgnitedGeek> here is a video of it in action: http://screencast.com/t/PDZIQAY25ASw
[13:40:59] <carpii> i write a jquery plugin .popup() which has been working well, but today im suddenly seeing a race condition which means 30% of the time I load my page, when i call $("#myelement").popup() I get a javascript error saying no such method. How can I troubleshoot this? The plug and jquery are both definitely being loaded
[13:41:20] <IgnitedGeek> nvm im an idiot
[13:41:49] <carpii> actually it says "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function" not unknown method
[13:42:01] <ExtraSteve> carpii: pastebin?
[13:42:16] <carpii> trying to craft an example to show, but its not easy
[13:43:54] <kirjs______> Hello, is there a simple way to make a deffered out of promise?
[13:44:49] <kirjs______> Let's say I have $.when(...) and I don't want to wait for it anymore?
[13:48:10] <BillCriswell> kirjs______: Can you just resolve it when you deicide you don't want to wait for it anymore?
[13:48:26] <ToApolytoXaos> question: is it possible to get value from input which is located in function a() and use it inside function b()?
[13:48:29] <kirjs______> Hm, let me try
[13:49:03] <kirjs______> BillCriswell: Wait, but how do I resolve a promise?
[13:49:03] <ToApolytoXaos> functions i'm referring in my example are of PHP code :/
[13:50:33] <BillCriswell> kirjs______: .done()... I might me misintpreting something though.
[13:50:44] <BillCriswell> Can you explain what you're doing?
[13:51:25] <kirjs______> Bill, I do some animations
[13:51:44] <kirjs______> I need to fire up the next one, when they all are done
[13:51:55] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[13:52:08] <kirjs______> So I take them and put into when
[13:52:15] <kirjs______> It returns a promise
[13:52:23] <kirjs______> Not a defered, so I can't not resolve it
[13:53:18] <kirjs______> If a user does some action, I have to stop all the animations
[13:53:48] <kirjs______> My thinking was to make a deferred out of the when's promise, and reject it
[13:54:20] <kirjs______> But I'm looking for a jquery way of doing it, rather creating a new defered and wrapping the when's promise
[13:55:11] <BillCriswell> kirjs______: Ok, so you have some animations that you want to be stoppable basically?
[13:56:36] <kirjs______> Bill, pretty much, they are not necessary jquery animations, just something that returs promise
[14:01:29] <BillCriswell> I'm not very familiar with these but I'm playing around to see if I can figure it out haha
[14:06:35] <kirjs______> BillCriswell: Haha, let me know if you have any questions
[14:09:02] <BillCriswell> kirjs______: http://jsbin.com/telaxu/1/edit?html,js,output ok, here is where I am with it.
[14:09:22] <BillCriswell> The fail happens if that button is clicked since I'm rejecting one of the deferreds.
[14:10:06] <islalobo> Hello, I'm using colorbox plugin and struggling to control when the box closes. I want it to only close when the user has hit either the 'submit' button or the 'no thanks' button
[14:10:38] <kirjs______> BillCriswell: That's when they are deffereds, but what if all of them are promises?
[14:10:59] <kirjs______> BillCriswell: I mean I could create a deferred and plug it in with others, and then reject
[14:12:14] <BillCriswell> The deferred can return a promise right? I always confuse the two.
[14:12:34] <kirjs______> BillCriswell: Correct. I
[14:12:55] <kirjs______>  I just don't want to do hacks if some promise.deferize() exists already
[14:15:30] <BillCriswell> Got ya... I think I'm missing something though.
[14:15:42] <kirjs______> Like what?
[14:18:37] <BillCriswell> I'm still hungover I think.
[14:20:26] <kirjs______> haha, ok, thanks anyway
[14:21:27] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[14:21:43] <BillCriswell> shoky is usually good with these types of questions, not sure he's around though.
[14:22:44] <carpii> what could cause "typeof $.fn.popup" to return "function", but then "typeof  $("#element").popup" is undefined ?
[14:23:47] <BillCriswell> carpii: Are you running typeof $.fn.popup in the console?
[14:24:21] <carpii> im console.logging it from my code, but also interactively using console yes
[14:24:57] <carpii> something is clearing it out, since my code says "function" but when I run it interactively, it says undefined
[14:25:06] <carpii> plugin conflict maybe?
[14:25:48] <BillCriswell> Sounds like it.
[14:26:25] <carpii> hm
[14:26:32] <carpii> yep, even $.fn -> []
[14:27:01] <BillCriswell> Oh weird haha
[14:27:08] <carpii> yeah its bizarre
[14:27:27] <BillCriswell> Anything else trying to take over $?
[14:28:30] <carpii> not that I know of, but its rather difficult to tell
[14:31:56] <BillCriswell> carpii: When if you do jQuery.fn
[14:32:00] <BillCriswell> What*
[14:32:17] <carpii> its the same --> []
[14:32:25] <carpii> but this is intermittent, on about 40% of times loading the page
[14:32:27] <carpii> the other times its fine
[14:32:33] <carpii> which makes it even more infuriating :)
[14:39:08] <mavihs> Hi there.
[14:39:54] <mavihs> I'm badly stuck at one place. http://jsfiddle.net/wjx8tkje/  When I try to drag this box it just suddenly moves up/down... Why is it happening so? Stuck since long on this
[14:40:24] <mavihs> It happens only for first time that box moves suddenly. Then draggable is working fine.
[14:41:21] <carpii> mav, I just tried something by sheer luck
[14:41:24] <carpii> {containment: "body"}
[14:41:34] <mavihs> Is it working fine then?
[14:41:35] <carpii> see if that helps?
[14:41:39] <carpii> i think so
[14:41:54] <carpii> but you cant drag sideways much
[14:41:56] <carpii> so not sure
[14:42:22] <mavihs> carpii: Not working. I tried on my local machine
[14:42:39] <carpii> http://jsfiddle.net/wjx8tkje/2/
[14:42:40] <carpii> but this?
[14:42:51] <mavihs> carpii: In fiddle there is no space on left so it is not moving.
[14:43:33] <mavihs> on my localmachine it tries to move left.. It's like moving toward 0,0
[14:45:05] <carpii> not sure, think fiddler is obfuscating things then
[14:45:11] <carpii> try putting a single html live without fiddler
[14:47:01] <mavihs> carpii: Okay. One more thing.. If I drag and leave then the card is flipped (i.e click event is also getting fired). I want that click event should not be fired when I'm dragging it. Is it possible?
[14:49:32] <carpii> hm
[14:49:51] <carpii> maybe if you set a bool var when dragging begins
[14:50:00] <carpii> then when you get the click event, you can ignore it and reset the flag
[14:50:57] <carpii> http://jsfiddle.net/wjx8tkje/6/
[14:50:59] <carpii> something like that
[14:53:46] <mavihs> carpii: Thanks a lot. It works like a charm. :)
[14:54:54] <carpii> np :)
[14:56:25] <mavihs> carpii: But I'm still stuck on old problem. Is it possible for you to copy the fiddle and try running it in local machine?
[14:56:36] <greengriminal> Hey guys quick question I want to be able to open a collapsable form when redirecting from one page to the other. Currently the page sits on "/dashboard". When I click Add 2nd Project it should redirect to "/portfolios" and open the collapsable form.
[14:56:42] <mavihs> I've spent 3 hours trying to fix it. But in vain :-/
[14:57:23] <greengriminal> So to give you an example: <a href="/portfolios" data-togglet="collapse" data-target="#demo" id="newproj" class="collapsed">Add 2nd Project</a>
[14:57:53] <greengriminal> My issue simply is with that ^^ example when I click the link it redirects me to the Portfolios page but doesn't open the collapsable form.
[15:00:32] <carpii> green, how are you expecting it to know to uncollapse the form ?
[15:01:05] <greengriminal> carpii, this is my problem
[15:01:38] <carpii> cany you just change /portfolios so the form doesnt egt the collapsed style applied ?
[15:01:40] <greengriminal> How can i click a link on /dashboard which redirects me to /portfolios and uncollapse a form.
[15:04:59] <greengriminal> carpii, ?
[15:05:12] <carpii> yup
[15:05:20] <carpii> see above?
[15:05:31] <greengriminal> egt what is that
[15:05:33] <greengriminal> get
[15:05:34] <carpii> cant you just change portfolio page to not collapse the form when it renders it?
[15:05:34] <greengriminal> lol
[15:08:09] <krambiorix> how can i make this a $('body').on('hover'.....   ?      http://jsfiddle.net/8xk1jcqs/1/
[15:08:52] <carpii> ! on
[15:08:55] <carpii> !on
[15:09:00] <carpii> okayyy
[15:09:02] <carpii> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[15:09:17] <Azrael_-> hi
[15:12:27] <krambiorix> carpii, yes i know but this doesn't show the checkbox anymore: http://jsfiddle.net/8xk1jcqs/2/
[15:19:25] <carpii> the 'hover' is a pseudo event which was removed in jquery 1.something
[15:19:29] <carpii> http://jsfiddle.net/8xk1jcqs/13/
[15:20:01] <carpii> even though the .hover() method is still present
[15:21:21] <krambiorix> carpii, thanks!
[15:21:27] <carpii> no probs
[15:40:29] <krambiorix> when uploading multiple files, there are multiple requests... How can i make 1 request of them? http://jsfiddle.net/6xtco6y6/7/
[15:51:45] <moru> hey all.. how are ya?
[15:54:42] <steelbrain> moru: Fine, wbu?

[16:06:55] <steelbrain> moru: Oh, I Welcome you to this channel.
[16:11:50] <wiggl3> When opening the panel at http://jsfiddle.net/wiggl3/exs1csda/4/show, is there a way to prevent the box shadow on `.snap-drawer` from being cut off by jQuery Mobile's `.ui-content`?
[16:16:20] <robert_c> Hi guys. I am totally new in jquery and javascript. I have a very few lines of code written in jquery I need to understand. Can somebody explain those lines in simple words for me?
[16:16:26] <robert_c> They are here: http://pastie.org/private/mmqkns2wsvoai6l8ssupq
[16:34:17] <jmdrawn__> Any idea why this http://pastebin.com/CZeTXSnA works in firefox but not chrome or safari?
[16:34:17] <StanAccy> Im trying to use jquery to make Ajax calls back to our server and just realized that the URLs provided to .ajax() are not context relative - they are either page relative or absolute (thus losing the installed context path).  I was reading up on ajaxPrefilter as a possible solution so that I could have a single place in our app to somehow set the installed context - can this be done using ajaxPrefilter()
[16:34:23] <StanAccy> and is it the best solution to this problem?
[16:34:48] <jmdrawn__> It doesn't seem to fire on clicking the element :o/
[16:36:27] <StanAccy> jmdrawn__: any reason you keep reselecting the same elements?
[16:37:38] <jmdrawn__> StanAccy: It's a slide out panel?
[16:38:15] <StanAccy> you just seem to be reselecting the same set of elements repeatedly.
[16:38:34] <StanAccy> can you put that code and sample html in to jsfiddle?
[16:42:17] <jmdrawn__> hmm not too sure how as it's drupal + sass
[16:43:23] <StanAccy> just take the js you pasted, and make some sample html
[16:43:30] <StanAccy> copy it from your app iuf you have to
[16:43:36] <StanAccy> you only need the relevant html sections
[16:47:20] <jmdrawn__> Ok think this is enough http://jsfiddle.net/wjr07f0f/
[16:47:30] <TeddyMurray> in jquery mobile, how can i open a dialog box from the javascript?
[16:47:52] <jmdrawn__> Its my local environment so guessing its going be full of holes
[16:50:41] <TeddyMurray> someone suggested: $.mobile.changePage("#myDialog"); but didn't work
[16:50:41] <jmdrawn__> Did that work? Sorry new to using jfiddle
[17:06:44] <jmdrawn__> No errors in chrome either
[17:09:11] <jmdrawn__> ughh sorry ignore me. It was a z-index thing causing the issue
[18:10:37] <Looney> I have a problem
[18:10:44] <Looney> creating pastie
[18:13:05] <Looney> http://pastebin.com/1hXrnvrQ
[18:13:46] <Looney> I get boolean is not a function for the callback(events) line
[18:16:32] <Looney> more than 600 people in channel and all quiet, did I come to wrong jQuery channel  :-P
[18:18:28] <systemfault> Well, It's #jQuery here, not #ShittyPluginUsingjQuery :/
[18:18:58] <systemfault> I could have helped if it was a jQuery question.
[18:19:00] <Looney> fair enough
[18:19:31] <Looney> wish me luck, moving to #ajax
[18:20:09] <systemfault> Looney: Does your callback function even look like http://fullcalendar.io/docs/event_data/events_function/     events: function(start, end, timezone, callback) {
[18:20:23] <systemfault> See how callback is the fourth parameter.
[18:21:10] <Looney> darn, I need to hit the bed
[18:21:20] <Looney> sleep deprivation is shit
[18:21:28] <systemfault> I know right :/
[18:21:29] <Looney> thanks a bunch systemfault
[18:21:53] <systemfault> You're welcome :)
[19:18:24] <AlexRussia> FickX4 nothing knew about my answer timeout :D
[19:19:38] <AlexRussia> arthurvr: does here exist some nice plugins for vim for jquery? :D
[19:26:01] <Steini> What is wrong with this var state = localStorage.hasOwnProperty('sidebarState') ? localStorage.getItem('sidebarState') : false;
[19:28:59] <Steini> Can someone pm me, I need a small help
[19:43:35] <javlens_> I'm setting a cookie via jquery on change of a select, and it seems to work until I set it to one particular value, then it seems to log me out, and after I log back in, the cookie still sets (I can see it in the chrome inspector), but it's not being read successfully
[19:52:54] <RTPMatt> What is the value?
[21:54:32] <AlexRussia> a stupid question number #n: how to make delay? does here exist function simular to 'sleep' in *nix shell
[21:54:35] <AlexRussia> ?
[22:08:42] <ProofTechnique> Hiya. I'm new to jQuery, and I'd like to know what I'm doing wrong the most in this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/734gea73/
[22:09:00] <ProofTechnique> I feel like passing around $ is awful, for instance, but I don't know what else to do
[22:33:02] <systemfault> You have setTimeout
[22:33:07] <systemfault> But it's not blocking.
[22:37:22] <systemfault> What is the problem with your code?
[22:37:52] <ProofTechnique> Nothing in particular, just looking for style and glaring idiocies.
[22:38:02] <systemfault> Also, why are you passing jQuery like that?
[22:38:11] <ProofTechnique> Updated to avoid passing jQuery like that. http://jsfiddle.net/734gea73/1/
[22:38:24] <ProofTechnique> I didn't know about that pattern until just now.
