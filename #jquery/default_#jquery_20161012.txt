[00:14:44] <arc_> [15:26:44] <hlve> Why would they prevent ctrl+f?
[00:14:53] <arc_> it selects the text that you found!!
[00:15:09] <arc_> somebody could type the whole document and steal it
[00:23:08] <coldhead> harrowing
[00:27:22] <SlizardW1zard> I am guessing with anonymous function you can bind the same function to the same click event multiple times right?
[00:28:20] <SlizardW1zard> if the answer is yes then i have found my issue, and if that is the case if it is a named function will same behaviour occurr?
[00:47:41] <SlizardW1zard> What is the proper way to rebind clicks to elements that created by javascript
[00:50:25] <coldhead> SlizardW1zard: either bind directly to the new element: $( newThang ).on('click', whatever); OR use delegation so that the event listener is attached to the parent and not the new elements themselves
[01:31:03] <jak2000> hi all
[01:31:11] <jak2000> anyone worked in JSSP or PHP?
[01:35:25] <jak2000> hi all
[03:38:41] <grimel> Hi, all. Is there any good jquery plugin, which places images as thumnails, we click on image - it opens on the same page and we can rotate and zoom it
[03:38:55] <grimel> or at least rotate
[03:39:05] <grimel> something like lightbox + rotating/zooming options
[04:00:37] <al_nz1> how do you set a breakpoint when debugging code in firebug
[04:09:24] <dminuoso_> al_nz1: use "debugger"
[04:10:01] <dminuoso_> (Firebug itself also allows you to set breakpoints by clicking ont he left sidebar)
[04:10:17] <dminuoso_> Surprised folks still use firebug. :)
[04:10:43] <Cork> dminuoso_: it is still the best development tool out there (though it is basically eol)
[04:15:48] <dminuoso_> Cork: I've been very happy with Chrome's development tools so far.
[04:16:24] <dminuoso_> (It's so much faster and offers features that Firebug simply does not have)
[04:16:26] <Cork> dminuoso_: there are quite a few things that are very cumbersome with chrome dev tools that are easy in firebug
[04:16:49] <Cork> the question is have you tested a modern version of firebug?
[04:17:01] <Cork> most features exist in firebug too, just in a different way
[04:17:10] <al_nz1> dminuoso_: why surprised?
[04:17:27] <al_nz1> oh chrome
[04:17:45] <Cork> and ya, the built in tools in firefox are a joke
[04:18:09] <dminuoso_> The builtins in firefox get you very far nowadays still though.
[04:18:18] <dminuoso_> Cork: I think realistically it's more of a preference.
[04:18:24] <Cork> you can do most of it, though it is VERY combersome
[04:18:39] <Cork> for example there list of scripts is horrible to navigate if you have long resource names
[04:18:54] <Cork> dminuoso_: it is a bit more then that
[04:19:00] <Cork> though they are working on them
[04:19:27] <Cork> chrome has another aim with there tools so searching for things isn't a prio for them (and is my biggest problem with them)
[04:20:01] <Cork> when debugging someones elses site and you don't know where the function is defined, chrome development tools are horrible
[04:20:01] <dminuoso_> Cork: My workflow has improved a lot speed wise with chrome devtools so far. :)
[04:20:28] <Cork> you have to go through each resource separately and search them individually
[04:20:34] <dminuoso_> Also that chrome console <3
[04:20:51] <Cork> isn't much better then anyones else
[04:20:57] <Cork> those are quite equal
[04:22:00] <dminuoso_> Cork: Then there's additional things that have become relevant to me. The seemless integration of react dev tools is another plus - Im not sure whether a firebug extension exists.
[04:22:14] <al_nz1> I need to get the index of a current bootstrap dropdown
[04:22:58] <al_nz1> I thought it would be as easy as : console.log($('.selectpicker.ethnicity').index());
[04:22:59] <al_nz1> for
[04:23:22] <al_nz1>  code: <select class="selectpicker ethnicity" name="ethnicity" id="ethnicity1" data-live-search="true" title="Choose" data-width="100%">
[04:23:25] <Cork> al_nz1: index is the offset in the selection array
[04:23:31] <Cork> are you sure that is what you want?
[04:24:10] <al_nz1> lets say I have three places on a form to select ethnicity. I want to know which one the user is in, 1,2,3
[04:24:39] <Cork> what would that have to do with index?
[04:25:24] <al_nz1> the jquery site shows it indexing divs : https://api.jquery.com/index/
[04:25:41] <Cork> ya, but what do you expect to get an index of?
[04:26:27] <al_nz1> well I have a delegated event :    $( "#home" ).on( "changed.bs.select", ".selectpicker.ethnicity", function(event) {
[04:26:36] <Cork> ah
[04:26:42] <Cork> you want $('.selectpicker.ethnicity').index(this)
[04:27:42] <al_nz1> ok. So I am still getting my head around what "this" returns
[04:27:56] <al_nz1> in various contects
[04:27:58] <al_nz1> contexts
[04:28:06] <Cork> al_nz1: in an event handler, this is the element the event handler is targeting
[04:28:44] <Cork> al_nz1: this out side the context of event handlers is the first value the caller of the function gave to .call(<this will be this, argument1, argument2...)
[04:29:09] <Cork> al_nz1: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call migth be of interest
[04:29:37] <Cork> al_nz1: if a function is called as a property on an object, the object automatically becomes this in the function
[04:30:13] <Cork> so var a = { tt: true }; a.test = function() { return this.tt; }); a.test() == true
[04:30:24] <Cork> that is what "this" is in javascript
[04:30:49] <al_nz1> right.
[04:31:02] <al_nz1> I guess it would help if I could find "this" in FBug
[04:31:59] <Cork> its in the local variables section in the debugger
[04:32:43] <Cork> ah, wrong debugger
[04:32:50] <Cork> in the "Watch" tab in scripts
[04:32:55] <Cork> you have "this" as a group
[04:35:36] <al_nz1> I have script
[04:35:39] <al_nz1> and watch on the right
[04:35:46] <al_nz1> where is "this" from there?
[04:36:07] <Cork> when you're in debug mode you have "this" on the right
[04:36:19] <Cork> but you need to be stepping thought a function
[04:36:31] <Cork> as the value is local to functions it can't be showed unless you're there
[04:37:07] <al_nz1> so I need to put a debugger; line in
[04:37:21] <Cork> or just click on the left (left of the line number
[04:37:30] <Cork> and trigger something that runs the function
[04:43:45] <al_nz1> Cork: real nice thanks.
[04:43:51] <Cork> np
[04:44:01] <al_nz1> Cork: knowing how to debug this stuff really makes learning so much easier
[07:37:26] <mikatone> I found that i need to follow a link after event preventDefault() how can i do it?
[07:38:51] <mikatone> anyone?
[07:38:56] <Cork> mikatone: best is to just not call preventDefault() if you need to do that
[07:39:21] <Cork> if you can't do that you can emulate part of the link behaviour by doing window.location = link.href
[07:39:41] <Cork> though that will kill some browser default behaviour (like ctrl+click to open new tab)
[07:39:50] <mikatone> So there is no simple way?
[07:40:00] <Cork> the simple way is to not call preventDefault()
[07:40:02] <mikatone> I've to get the href and follow it
[07:40:22] <mikatone> but if don't I will follow the link...
[07:40:24] <Cork> you can't fake click links cause it is a security problem in browsers
[07:40:37] <Cork> mikatone: ya, that is what you said you wanted...
[07:40:52] <Cork> just if case if you call preventDefault() so you only call it when you DON'T want to follow it
[07:41:10] <Cork> that is really the only clean way to do it
[07:41:11] <mikatone> I want the user to take full decision on it
[07:41:18] <mikatone> so don't use preventDefault
[07:42:20] <Cork> well you want to use preventDefault() to prevent the link clicking when you don't want it
[07:42:38] <Cork> there just isn't a way to unPreventDefautl()
[07:42:43] <Cork> *unPreventDefault()
[07:42:47] <mikatone> lol
[07:42:50] <mikatone> yeah
[07:43:07] <mikatone> so how can I "pause" it?
[07:43:10] <Cork> you can't
[07:43:26] <Cork> either you let it through, or it is gone
[07:43:48] <Cork> an option is to show an overlay and when clicking a "button" there you do the real link
[07:44:23] <mikatone> can't do that can't touch the interface
[07:44:33] <mikatone> can only add javascript
[07:44:44] <Cork> then your only option is to use window.location = this.href;
[07:44:53] <Cork> and just force it to leave the page
[07:44:55] <mikatone> ok it's fine
[07:44:59] <Cork> (no it isn't)
[07:45:29] <Cork> making ctrl+click replace the current page is extremely frustrating
[07:46:19] <mikatone> sorry I believe i don't follow, the page is rendered server side. I can't touch the interface... what can i do?
[07:46:37] <Cork> as you're backbound like that; nothing
[07:46:48] <Cork> that is the problem your solving the problem at the wrong place
[07:47:32] <Cork> mikatone: the best option is to make it so you don't have to pause the event
[07:47:56] <Cork> just do the things you need to do inline in the event handler and if everything works just don't call event.preventDefault()
[07:48:19] <Cork> and then fix everything around this flow to support that
[07:48:36] <Cork> then you don't have to hack around browser security
[07:48:40] <mikatone> not sure I can handle it...
[07:48:53] <Cork> what is it you need to do before the link is followed?
[07:51:02] <mikatone> the user is presented with a modal with its won text message blá blá and then the user takes decision on what to do the <a> element it's actually will follow to the same domain I think that the link security situation is only taken into account when talking about different domains right?
[07:52:19] <mikatone> ok but I understand the message not use the preventDefault in <a> elements
[07:54:46] <verax5> anyone online yo
[07:55:50] <Uhku> just ask yo
[07:56:49] <mikatone> Cork so what's the best way to prevent default action for an Anchor tag using Javascript ?
[07:57:49] <Cork> mikatone: $('select').on('click', function(event) { if(something != somethingElse) { event.preventDefault() } })
[07:57:53] <mikatone> Cork I get that $('a').click(function(){    return false; }); this is bad
[08:01:20] <mikatone> Cork that will not solve my problem as I have a callback waiting for user decision... the call back is returning false or true but this code is async except for the part of the callback...
[08:02:18] <mikatone> Cork and if I wait for user decision ex: if(!answer) { evt.preventDefault() } will not work
[08:02:45] <Cork> mikatone: why does it have to be async?
[08:02:59] <Cork> THAT is where this is falling down for you
[08:03:33] <Cork> as browsers don't let you handle link following from none trusted events
[08:03:41] <Cork> and you would lose that in the async callback
[08:04:29] <mikatone> ok take a look at my code please https://gist.github.com/anonymous/32540d8368d8b05ac2195125ba70f078
[08:05:10] <Cork> ya, you would have to modify how ModalUserAction works
[08:05:19] <Cork> you can't solve this cleanly with the structure you have
[08:05:56] <Cork> (you would have to send the link into ModalUserAction and the accept action would have to be a link following the url
[08:07:03] <mikatone> Cork can't has this is a generic function
[08:07:42] <Cork> mikatone: it can, it just have to have an alternative markup where the accept is a link instead of what ever you use now
[08:08:12] <Cork> there really isn't any other option except for hacks
[08:09:19] <mikatone> Cork I can do it with hacks but now I've conscience that can be down in a clean way, can you write a simple example on how to solve this CLEAN please?
[08:09:32] <mikatone> *done
[08:09:37] <Cork> mikatone: i already have
[08:09:55] <Cork> give ModalUserAction an option for "link" or what ever
[08:10:12] <Cork> if it is given the link it should render an <a> tag and just run that link action
[08:10:35] <Cork> if you like you can in the module also bind a click handler on it and execute the callback (syncronly) from it
[08:10:41] <Cork> then you should have all you need
[08:11:10] <mikatone> Cork sorry to disagree but before the user takes any decision the link will be fired...
[08:11:29] <Cork> the original link is meant to be abortded
[08:11:37] <Cork> a NEW link is meant to be the accept button
[08:11:40] <mikatone> With preventDefault
[08:11:55] <Cork> you can't merge the two together
[08:11:57] <Cork> it isn't possible
[08:12:20] <mikatone> but I want to learn a solution without using preventDefault...
[08:12:28] <Cork> uh
[08:12:29] <mikatone> Cork just give me code man
[08:12:35] <mikatone> :)
[08:12:41] <Cork> the other solution is to not have ModuleUserAction be async
[08:12:47] <Cork> and i don't think you can do that
[08:12:55] <Cork> guessing from what the code does
[08:13:28] <mikatone> just provide me with a generic solution so i can study
[08:13:31] <mikatone> please
[08:13:40] <Cork> i already have several times
[08:14:03] <Cork> i can't give you code cause that would require me to get all the relevant code you haven't shared
[08:21:21] <mikatone> Cork I can't make guesses based on assumptions I need to see code, all you're giving me are indications... don't take me wrong but I'm waiting to learn something and I believe you could provide me with the last bits to solve the puzzle but thanks anyway...
[08:22:10] <Cork> mikatone: i'm not going to write an example application just to show you the concept of none executing a line when you don't want to...
[08:22:23] <Cork> *of not executing a line
[08:22:43] <mikatone> Cork I want :)
[08:24:00] <mikatone> I've executed several lines but none worked for me. As I said the main issue here is that the link is fired before I take any decision
[08:24:27] <mikatone> only preventDefault works
[08:24:39] <mikatone> not sure how to put this
[08:25:13] <mikatone> it is clear that I'm about to lean something
[08:25:31] <mikatone> and I'm frustrated because I can get it
[08:29:45] <mikatone> I think we could jump to the topic on how to write: <a> tag link non obstrutive enhancement with modal
[08:32:38] <mikatone> ok so thank you and have a nice day
[08:33:24] <mar77i> hello #jquery. I have
[08:33:38] <mar77i> this modal dialog here which I'm using as an editing form.
[08:34:28] <mar77i> I realized, form html would be returned if the form was not valid for some reason, which means I cannot use html forms' submit functionality but have to use ajax.
[08:35:25] <mar77i> but for ajax, I'm somehow unable to get the form data into the shape given by the form tag....
[08:36:29] <mar77i> alert(form.serialize()) // opens an empty alert box
[08:41:43] <mar77i> there's a file upload involved too, though. does jquery's ajax infrastructure handle such a thing?
[09:45:08] <mar77i> hmm. this worked.
[09:46:28] <mar77i> once the backend is in the mood for sending a form along...
[10:00:23] <hellyeah> o
[10:00:25] <hellyeah> yo
[10:07:30] <jak2000> hellyeah I AM TOO
[10:07:35] <jak2000> WANT A BEER
[10:07:37] <jak2000> sorry for capss
[10:58:43] <Koopz> is there a datepicker like plugin which offers a popup calendar and autocompletion for manual input?
[10:59:14] <Koopz> a user insists that he NEEDS to write 16 instead of 2016
[10:59:57] <taplar> you can configure the datepicker to take in a different format than YYYY
[11:00:42] <Koopz> can i support both formats?
[11:00:54] <taplar> afaik, you have to choose one
[11:01:48] <Koopz> would the configuration result in the datepicker automatically converting 16 to 2016?
[11:01:58] <taplar> yep
[11:02:04] <taplar> well i say that...
[11:02:08] <taplar> lets see
[11:02:40] <Koopz> we're using the german format... there can't be any confusion at all regarding the order of values :D
[11:03:04] <taplar> actually i think it would be sent to the backend as whatever they typed in
[11:03:38] <taplar> so your backend would have to interpret YY into a YYYY format
[11:26:39] <coder7of9> which is a higher overhead: unsetting and resetting multiple event handlers (ajax loads) vs setting event handlers once and bubbling up to a higher parent
[11:30:47] <taplar> unsetting and resetting
[11:32:23] <taplar> heh, you've asked this question in different ways at least three times since yesterday.  asking until you get the answer you want?
[11:35:55] <coder7of9> i did not. i was disconnected yesterday.
[11:37:11] <coder7of9> just after another viewpoint
[11:38:45] <taplar> all events bubble, so the only overhead that a delegate adds is the filter check
[11:39:00] <taplar> where as adding and removing is all that that entails
[11:39:37] <taplar> you want to make it modular.  bind your delegates low enough that they are there when they need to be, but are removed if the modular block they are associated with gets removed so they do not linger
[11:40:51] <taplar> *the majority of events bubble
[11:41:07] <mar77i> so uh.
[11:41:41] <mar77i> is there a simpler way to write $(mycheckboxes).prop('checked', false).change() ?
[11:42:09] <taplar> your wanting to change them to false and then trigger the change event?
[11:42:14] <mar77i> no.
[11:42:28] <mar77i> derp. only change them to false, actually. :)
[11:42:36] <taplar> so don't do the change() part
[12:06:05] <coder7of9> thanks taplar
[12:17:29] <arschmitz> No
[12:17:47] <arschmitz> Keep forgetting about that one
[12:17:55] <arschmitz> I'm terrible
[12:18:27] <arschmitz> Need to actually check my assigned tickets
[12:34:37] <Duikb00t-home> var items = 4; $.each(items, ... ) is that possible?
[12:34:45] <Duikb00t-home> or should I convert it in a way to an array?
[12:43:27] <MikeD_> Duikb00t-home:  can you describe in words what you wanted that to do?
[12:43:49] <Duikb00t-home> I think I figured it out with a 'for' loop ;)

[12:54:40] <Krisostoomus> hello
[12:55:01] <taplar> aloha
[12:55:13] <Krisostoomus> how do you iterate through all elements of html page?
[12:55:36] <taplar> $('*').each(....) but that's pretty heavy
[12:55:42] <taplar> what are you trying to do?
[12:57:12] <Krisostoomus> i need to get viewport working in windows safari, which doesn't support it's units "vw" and "vh"
[13:19:40] <bad_ip> I'm sending an ajax call the body keeps being sent with a : at the end
[13:19:56] <bad_ip> Does anyone know why it keeps appending the :?
[13:21:49] <bad_ip> http://pastebin.com/M3upRWuy
[13:22:29] <bad_ip> {"emails": ["user@domain.com"]}:
[13:22:34] <bad_ip> That's what it's returning like
[13:22:44] <bad_ip> err, sending like
[13:23:19] <taplar> hmm
[13:24:21] <bad_ip> the API is expecting an array with square brackets, so I'm trying to use do that
[13:29:15] <taplar> try this: https://jsfiddle.net/8yjdrL1b/
[13:30:31] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/8yjdrL1b/1/  sorry, not toString
[13:33:23] <bad_ip> taplar: that worked, thanks!
[13:33:33] <taplar> cool
[13:33:52] <bad_ip> the function still isn't working but I think that's the SendGrid API
[13:34:13] <bad_ip> I'm 99% sure their delete function is broked
[13:35:43] <jquery719> Can I use a switch statement to display/hide certain divs based on my current url? I have it set up to how I think I need it, but not sure if JSFiddle actually gives me a url to check it.. https://jsfiddle.net/w2vhdp5b/2/
[13:36:08] <taplar> jquery719: don't wrap it in $()
[13:36:40] <taplar> just use it like your doing when you log it
[13:36:45] <jquery719> on my var?
[13:36:57] <taplar> yep
[13:37:37] <jquery719> alright. so i'm still returning this url in console: /_display/   but in my switch case it doesn't show my div
[13:38:23] <jquery719> is that a jsfiddle thing since it's not an actual url?
[13:38:41] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/w2vhdp5b/4/
[13:38:52] <taplar> your matcher was missing a '/' at the end
[13:39:37] <taplar> and fwiw, you don't need the ; at the end of the switch statement
[13:41:00] <jquery719> So if I have a url that doesnt end in '/' I can't use this? if I'm searching for /foo/  but my url is actually /foo  it won't find that switch case?
[13:41:16] <taplar> the string needs to match
[13:41:38] <jquery719> or should I set multiple cases, just to be safe:  case: foo, case: /foo, case: /foo/?
[13:43:37] <jquery719> basically what I'm trying to do is show a specific banner across 4 different pages, but I'm trying to catch at the top of the directory, so every page under neath gets it's relevant banner
[13:45:00] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/w2vhdp5b/7/
[13:45:13] <taplar> or something like that
[13:45:30] <taplar> otherwise put logic on each of the 4 pages that would do that, instead of having to do an if or switch
[13:46:07] <jquery719> I would but we're using a community frame work that only lets us use a single js file and all the pages match the template
[13:46:16] <jquery719> so I'm trying to do this overhead lol
[13:46:54] <taplar> i assume then your able to change the actual contents of each page then?
[13:47:41] <taplar> or more importantly
[13:47:53] <jquery719> Yes, but only using pre-made components
[13:47:54] <taplar> does that '.hi' element exist on the pages that your not going to show it on
[13:48:25] <jquery719> I have a div that holds all 4 banners, which are hidden, until the js returns true
[13:48:30] <jquery719> then it shows the relative banner
[13:48:46] <taplar> and your including that div on all the pages?
[13:48:59] <jquery719> I originally had it done by using page title, but think url would be a little better
[13:49:13] <jquery719> yes, but only pages that would actually get 1 of the 4 banners
[13:49:32] <taplar> it's kinda odd that you're returning html that you're never going to show on certain pages
[13:50:29] <jquery719> gotta love those workarounds lol
[13:50:44] <taplar> not really.  its boating the response to the user
[13:51:28] <taplar> in any case, are you able to do something like give the body a distinct class for each of the four pages?
[13:51:40] <taplar> you could check for that, might be better than url checking
[13:51:58] <jquery719> Nope, that was my first idea
[14:14:20] <al_nz1> morning all
[14:14:33] <al_nz1> morning taplar
[14:14:39] <taplar> hola
[14:15:33] <al_nz1> hahah - are you in central america?
[14:15:43] <taplar> i like to try to switch up my welcomes
[14:15:49] <al_nz1> :)
[14:16:15] <al_nz1> I got firebug and have even been using breakpoints
[14:16:19] <al_nz1> makes it easier
[14:16:26] <taplar> good deal
[14:17:06] <taplar> you're doing better than me then.  i'm usually stubborn and keep putting console logs in, ^_^
[14:17:13] <al_nz1> hahaha
[14:17:26] <al_nz1> the website you gave me said thats ugly :)
[14:17:44] <taplar> alert() is ugly.  console.log is just unnecessary
[14:17:53] <taplar> but, old habits
[14:17:58] <al_nz1> ya
[14:18:02] <al_nz1> u in USA?
[14:18:08] <taplar> yep
[14:18:15] <al_nz1> which state
[14:18:19] <taplar> arkansas
[14:19:11] <al_nz1> oh sweet. Never been there but I was in Baton Rouge a few years back for a movie shoot
[14:19:43] <taplar> Louisiana is cool too
[14:19:57] <taplar> I like the little bit of less heat we get though
[14:20:35] <al_nz1> yer it was HOT
[14:20:39] <al_nz1> and very green
[14:20:42] <al_nz1> I want to go back
[14:20:47] <robertmaxrees> isn't it humid down there, too?
[14:20:55] <robertmaxrees> and what's the heat like?
[14:20:57] <al_nz1> yes, hot and humid
[14:21:08] <taplar> oh yeah
[14:21:12] <taplar> i'd say come to arkansas if you love green.  that's like our staple, lol
[14:21:23] <taplar> go to arizona if you hate the humidity
[14:21:29] <robertmaxrees> or norcal
[14:21:47] <al_nz1> taplar: well I am thinking next year of going into houston (Air NZ fly there) and doing a southern states road trip
[14:21:55] <al_nz1> Memphis, NOLA, etc
[14:22:13] <al_nz1> do I need to come to Arkansas?
[14:22:32] <taplar> lol, you're asking a native.  the answer you get is going to be biast one way or the other
[14:22:58] <al_nz1> well tell me whats there!
[14:23:12] <drej> a monkey
[14:23:37] <taplar> lots of forests and "mountains", lakes, etc.
[14:23:54] <al_nz1> sounds like NZ all over again
[14:24:04] <taplar> i'm sure there's some interesting stuff, but when you see it all the time, *shrug*
[14:24:32] <AwkwardCough> Well we do have one less bridge now
[14:24:38] <taplar> oh yeah!
[14:24:44] <al_nz1> ?
[14:24:48] <taplar> we failed to blow up a bridge yesterday
[14:24:51] <al_nz1> hahaha
[14:24:59] <taplar> they tried to implode it and failed
[14:25:03] <taplar> then they pulled it down with a tugboat
[14:25:28] <al_nz1> back OT for a moment
[14:25:35] <taplar> :O
[14:25:38] * taplar cries
[14:25:53] <al_nz1> with all these new fandagled tools I have, is there a quick way to find a code snippet and copy it (to another tab?
[14:26:00] <al_nz1> sublime is my IDE
[14:26:06] <al_nz1> and obviously have FF and FB
[14:26:34] <taplar> not entirely sure what your asking
[14:26:43] <robertmaxrees> why not just install a code snippet tool in your editor?
[14:26:46] <robertmaxrees> i know vs code supports it.
[14:27:13] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: does a code snippet tool just assign particular code to a shortcut key or is it more than that?
[14:27:21] <robertmaxrees> more than that.
[14:27:32] <robertmaxrees> you can have it recognize something you're typing and it can autocomplete.
[14:27:52] <al_nz1> hmm
[14:28:12] <robertmaxrees> better tools will also let you tab to specific things so you can then fill them out.  like i have a shortcut where i type label and it can autocomplete when i hit enter.  then i just tab through whatever attributes i need to add
[14:28:15] <taplar> i'm probably going to try to switch to vs code when we go to grails 3, since it kills the grails view in intellij
[14:28:33] <robertmaxrees> i loooove vs code.
[14:28:59] <robertmaxrees> the debugger is legit and the plugins are pretty rad, too.
[14:29:51] <al_nz1> are you in intellij taplar?
[14:30:07] <taplar> yep
[14:30:21] <AwkwardCough> aww... you guys are just talking about visual studios... I thought vs code was talking about some new software where you get to fight code
[14:30:35] <taplar> we always get to fight code man, :P
[14:30:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:30:58] <robertmaxrees> visual studio code IS technically newer buuuuuuut
[14:34:54] <AwkwardCough> what a cliffhanger to go to lunch on
[14:35:17] <taplar> i'm slightly interested in how hard it would be to write an extension for vs code.  no goovy/grails extension for it yet
[14:38:14] <taplar> you going to write one with the AwkwardCough? :D
[14:39:34] <al_nz1> do you vaguely remember that form I shows you taplar?
[14:40:06] <taplar> with the selectpicker?
[14:40:17] <al_nz1> yes that was part of it
[14:40:28] <al_nz1> you knw how there was a panel with about 20 fields for each person?
[14:40:38] <taplar> kinda
[14:41:26] <al_nz1> I need to have a "add" person button. to add a group of fields dynamically. This guy did it here : http://bootsnipp.com/snippets/XaXB0 but if I do it his way my "newIn" var will be huge. Is there a better way?
[14:42:02] <taplar> i'd use a template myself
[14:42:06] <Duikb00t-home> when I have 5 divs just casual divs and I would like to dected on mousehover which one is hovered
[14:42:15] <Duikb00t-home> how do I check that inside my hover statement?
[14:42:17] <Duikb00t-home> target?
[14:42:32] <taplar> Duikb00t-home: that sounds right, or simply 'this'
[14:42:54] <Duikb00t-home> I would like to color other divs based on the 'the element that is hovered'
[14:43:16] <al_nz1> taplar: got a link to a example?
[14:43:25] <al_nz1> taplar: all needs to be client ide
[14:43:26] <al_nz1> side
[14:43:35] <taplar> al_nz1: i can throw together a quick example
[14:43:39] <Duikb00t-home> [=] [=] [=]  and then I have <ul><li>1</li>.... if I hover 1. I want to color the first box, if I hoverthe second list item i would like to hover the first two boes
[14:43:41] <Duikb00t-home> boxes*
[14:44:06] <al_nz1> taplar: ok ta
[14:44:28] <Duikb00t-home> But it seems I can't get the 'element'
[14:45:05] <taplar> Duikb00t-home: your life will be a lot easier if you have some sort of class and/or data elements that tie the two things together
[14:45:15] <Duikb00t-home> would it?
[14:45:16] <Duikb00t-home> :D
[14:45:19] <Duikb00t-home> I could do it
[14:45:27] <Duikb00t-home> data-elm
[14:45:30] <Duikb00t-home> ="..."
[14:46:24] <Duikb00t-home> <li data-id="3">3</li>  better/ :)
[14:49:33] <Duikb00t-home> Ok great it works :D
[14:49:44] <Duikb00t-home> Just 1 thing left: when I get element 3
[14:50:24] <Duikb00t-home> then I get that variable inside my console perfect can I add a class to all the items, from element 1 to ... 3 for example?
[14:50:30] <Duikb00t-home> ( Something like nth-child )
[14:50:57] <taplar> al_nz1: without another library you can do something like this https://jsfiddle.net/8f4vxwh7/
[14:51:17] <taplar> there are libraries that will do this for you and more though.  handlebars, mustache, etc
[14:52:30] <taplar> Duikb00t-home: if you would create a fiddle with what your trying.  Will be easier for me to suggest pointers towards a solution
[14:52:43] <Duikb00t-home> yes but I don't want you to type anyting ok? :D
[14:52:50] <Duikb00t-home> It's really a exercise for myself to become better :D
[14:52:56] <taplar> fine, i'll just tell you things, :)
[14:52:59] <Duikb00t-home> https://jsfiddle.net/wbxa1swj/2/
[14:54:08] <taplar> ok, so now can you get two variables, one containing all the divs you want to hover over, and another with all the lis that should be changed?
[14:54:11] <al_nz1> taplar: hmmm, dont quite follow that in terms of dynamically adding forms?
[14:54:32] <al_nz1> with a add button...
[14:54:42] <Duikb00t-home> yes
[14:54:48] <taplar> al_nz1: what that example shows is how to have the 'template' of what you want to create in the markup, instead of the js itself
[14:55:07] <taplar> then when you want to create a new one, you get that string, replace the placeholders with the data you want to show, and append that
[14:57:03] <Duikb00t-home> Hmhmhmhmh
[14:57:09] <al_nz1> taplar: I see, so what you are saying is put the html in the script tags in the html document, then in the JS you are just using an array to hold the data and then the append map to insert it?
[14:57:26] <taplar> yup
[14:57:44] <Duikb00t-home> Actually $currItems (   var currItems = $(this).attr("data-id"); // )
[14:57:46] <al_nz1> taplar: and if I dont need to insert the data, just add a bunch of empty fields for the user
[14:57:53] <al_nz1> then forget var= data
[14:57:59] <al_nz1> var data = i mean
[14:58:00] <Duikb00t-home> is the number containing the divs that should be changed.. I could make that div global? But not sure why I should do that.
[14:58:33] <taplar> Duikb00t-home: take a look at this guy and think what you could do if you had those two collections in vars http://api.jquery.com/index/
[15:06:54] <Duikb00t-home> hmm https://jsfiddle.net/wbxa1swj/3/ taplar
[15:07:04] <Duikb00t-home> bit confused about the linking to the .square * nth element
[15:12:34] <taplar> lets see
[15:12:43] <Duikb00t-home> wait
[15:12:53] <Duikb00t-home> https://jsfiddle.net/wbxa1swj/5/ taplar
[15:13:25] <taplar> $(this).index() isn't going to give you want you want i don't believe
[15:13:30] <taplar> re-read that doc page
[15:13:44] <taplar> index() gives you the index of the element amongst the selected elements
[15:14:07] <Duikb00t-home> oh
[15:14:08] <Duikb00t-home> ok
[15:14:43] <taplar> bunch of example on that doc page demonstrating that
[15:14:55] <Duikb00t-home> ok :D thx
[15:15:00] <Duikb00t-home> leme read some more
[15:15:03] <Duikb00t-home> brb break for a minute
[15:15:10] * Duikb00t-home duikb00t|afk
[15:21:00] <al_nz1> is there something in firebug to help with seeing layout (borders padding etc?
[15:21:21] <taplar> the normal inspector has that
[15:21:41] <taplar> inspecting an element should open it up and on the RHS it will have the css rules displayed
[15:21:59] <al_nz1> yeah but its only on the screen for a second
[15:22:02] <al_nz1> then disappears
[15:22:07] <taplar> ?
[15:22:16] <al_nz1> right click 'Q' ?
[15:22:32] <taplar> ya
[15:22:57] <taplar> your not trying to hit the Q key are you?
[15:23:58] <taplar> hit F12 and then choose the "Inspector" tab
[15:24:03] <al_nz1> no, Im using the context menu
[15:30:19] <al_nz1> still here taplar?
[15:32:20] <taplar> yep
[15:34:35] <al_nz1> taplar: see on the last tab
[15:34:38] <al_nz1> question 3
[15:35:01] <al_nz1> I have added custom padding to avoid the question touching the panel border?
[15:35:14] <al_nz1> (whereas above I use a whole colum)
[15:35:40] <al_nz1> is adding the padding that way acceptable? (I will have to do it all all questions on that page ultimately)
[15:35:44] <taplar> you mean the big white space on the left vs very little on the right?
[15:36:20] <al_nz1> taplar: yes the big white space is where I used a column (bootstrap is 12 column grid) but I need the space so tried question 3 with padding
[15:37:48] <taplar> you have your label outside of a div
[15:38:01] <taplar> i'm not a big css guy, but i think you'd want it to match the others
[15:39:15] <taplar> like what would it look like if you stuck that label in the first div and changed the first div to sm-7 ?
[15:44:37] <al_nz1> checking
[15:47:54] <al_nz1> taplar: hmm, not quite
[15:52:23] <al_nz1> if i dont add padding everything just bunches up against the other stuff
[15:57:51] <taplar> ok, so i think i got it 'ok' looking
[15:58:14] <taplar> first i reduced every row to be three divs of 7, 1, 4
[15:58:33] <taplar> the first div i gave a padding-left: 27px
[15:58:50] <taplar> same on the last dive but with padding-right
[15:58:52] <taplar> *div
[15:59:34] <al_nz1> i am reading the bootstrap grid doc page now, and it seems to say there should be default padding included
[15:59:50] <al_nz1> Im sure I dont need my colums nested as much as they are?
[16:00:04] <taplar> there is but it looks like your doing some floating and positioning that are probably affecting that
[16:00:30] <al_nz1> where do you see the floating?
[16:01:15] <al_nz1> container-fluid?
[16:01:16] <taplar> looks like it may be apart of bootstrap, it's in the grid-framework-less
[16:01:32] <taplar> it's attached to all the sm-# classes
[16:01:58] <taplar> but yeah, your form-group div could go away if you wanted and that class put on the outer div ( i think )
[16:02:30] <al_nz1> yeah, its well over complicted
[16:03:20] <al_nz1> it also says containers are not nesteable http://getbootstrap.com/css/ but I think up near body I have nested them
[16:03:27] <al_nz1> (container and container-fluid)
[16:04:35] <taplar> you might hit up ##bootstrap .  you're going outside of my realm of familiarity, :D
[16:04:46] <al_nz1> yeah. I will that channel is a bit dead
[16:59:56] <al_nz1> if only columns may be immediate children of rows,does that mean after a <div class="row"> must come a <div class="whatever col-sm-12"> ?
[17:00:05] <al_nz1> so not even a <br/> is technically allowed straight after a <div class="row">
[17:07:36] <taplar> no that's valid
[17:23:07] <taplar> the restriction your thinking off is <td>'s within <tr>'s
[17:30:03] <taplar> i'm saying you said that console.log($(selector).length) was undefined and console.log($.fn.jquery) was undefined, so at whatever point you executed that logic jQuery was not bound to $
[17:30:03] <taplar> but now your saying $('#name') works else where, so you got something else going on
[17:30:03] <mikatone> taplar ok but I have 440 lines of jquery code and all work fine except for this bit
[17:30:03] <taplar> is all your logic using $ included after your jQuery include?
[17:30:03] <mikatone> yes
[17:30:03] <taplar> i'd have to see it breaking then at this point
[17:36:48] <mikatone> taplar this is the function where I'm updating the hidden field http://jsbin.com/vevalucoma/1/edit?js,output
[17:39:29] <taplar> which line is getting the error?
[17:40:46] <mikatone> no error just undefined, at line certificateId.val(data.certificate.id);
[17:43:17] <taplar> what if you do certificateId.val('weeeeee');
[17:45:28] <al_nz1> grrrr, Im ready to throw this bootstrap out the window
[17:46:34] <mikatone> taplar nothing happens the field does not get populated :(
[17:46:47] <taplar> console.log(data.certificate.id);
[17:47:16] <mikatone> and post is getting all keys and respective values except for this one
[17:47:39] <mikatone> console.log(data.certificate.id); is a integer
[17:47:46] <mikatone> according to user data
[17:47:56] <taplar> but in the code what does it print
[17:48:31] <mikatone> console.log(data.certificate.id); is part of a json structure
[17:48:44] <taplar> what does that print though, lol
[17:50:23] <mikatone> taplar json response {"user":{"name":"John Doe","active":true},"certificate":{"id":716,"number":"TGF000715"}}
[17:50:49] <taplar> -_- that's what the console.log prints?
[17:51:11] <mikatone> taplar nope it prints 716
[17:51:54] <mikatone> console.log(data.certificate.id) -> outputs 716
[17:52:16] <taplar> ok, so setting the val('weeee') doesn't error and the console log of the data prints 716, but the setting of the val with the data is an error, is what we're saying?
[17:54:31] <mikatone> taplar setting the val('weeee') doesn't set any value, as console.log() stills read undefined after that! And the console log of the data.certificate.id prints 716
[17:55:04] <taplar> hold on, what are you saying is console logging undefined?
[17:55:26] <mikatone> exactly
[17:55:35] <taplar> i'm asking, lol
[17:55:44] <mikatone> lol mo problem
[17:55:49] <mikatone> I get that ;)
[17:55:55] <mikatone> *no
[17:56:14] <taplar> dunno dude, i don't see a console.log in this snipplet
[17:56:26] <mikatone> yes i removed it
[17:56:28] <taplar> except the top one
[17:57:17] <mikatone> I've made all tests I can assure you it doesn't work nothing can update the hidden field
[17:57:57] <taplar> can you show me in the pastebin or something the snipplet that you are using that is console logging the undefined?
[18:04:17] <mikatone> I've tried several approaches on selectors to select the hidden field... and I just found out what the problem was... pfffff
[18:05:30] <taplar> ?
[18:05:45] <mikatone> taplar the problem was related with the id being generated wrong name basic basic stuff It didn't haver failed to generate a valid id this time the framework failed to generate correct id and my selector was pointing to nowhere... ughhhh
[18:06:14] <mikatone> sorry for being such a di*k
[18:06:28] <mikatone> and thank you so so much for all you help
[18:06:53] <taplar> ah, cool
[18:07:00] <taplar> i should have had to log the length again, :)
[18:07:19] <mikatone> I've never suspected because never failed to generate correct id
[18:07:36] <mikatone> just with hidden field strange...
[18:12:20] <mikatone> taplar it makes sense now, the framework is not generating an id attr only name attr mostly because user shouldn't ever use hidden fields...
[18:20:05] <mikatone> good night to everyone I'm at GMT +0 sleeping mode now :)
[18:20:31] <taplar> take care
[18:37:18] <taplar> i'm gonna jump out too and head home.  later all, :)
[19:25:35] <robertmaxrees> finally getting my stuff back together.
[19:25:35] <robertmaxrees> yeeesh
[20:10:08] <ElectricAlan> hello all, I'm looking for some help with the jquery validator plugin
[20:11:15] <ElectricAlan> I have two select fields I want to compare with the 'notEqual' function, but I only want to validation to happen when there's a value chosen in both of them
[20:13:30] <ElectricAlan> otherwise the message of 'selections must not match' comes up when both fields are blank and I would liek to avoid this
[20:14:13] <ElectricAlan> I tried adding in my own custom validation method that just takes a boolean, and then passing a function that returns a boolean to my rules, but I haven't gotten that working perfectly either
[21:10:07] <Cupertina> Anyone here knows how to scrape a facebook profile's about page?
[21:10:08] <Cupertina> I have been looking at the HTML but it looks so unstructured
[22:41:02] <ISmithers> Maybe someone can advise me on this code I'm seeing in our codebase. I've found a few areas where whoever wrote it has done this: $(registrant).children(".fields").children().children().children("input")... I've changed it to: $(registrant).find(".fields input")...
[22:41:09] <ISmithers> Am I going to encounter an issue I am not aware of in doing so?
[22:41:39] <ISmithers> (For what its worth I've tested it and it works fine, but I'm just curious)
[22:43:32] <ISmithers> The HTML is pretty simple. A <div> parent with a bunch of <div> containers within it, of which one has the 'fields' class and some child elements of which one is an <input> element.
[23:13:24] <Zequal> Hey guys, a little new to jquery - I'm trying to make a select all button, but can't seem to get the on-click effect to trigger.

[23:14:07] <Zequal> Any ideas?
[23:49:56] <ISmithers> I think you need to use .prop('checked', true); Zequal
[23:50:02] <ISmithers> At least that's what I use for checkboxes.
[23:50:46] <ISmithers> jQuery v 1.10 is what I use. I believe the method you use is for 1.5x and below.
