[12:15:03] <smgs__> https://jsfiddle.net/sasapp/t3Lo0z7y/2/ how can i click on it ?
[12:15:05] <smgs__> thanks
[12:18:47] <taplar> that's a javascript question
[12:19:08] <taplar> but getElementsByClassName returns an array, you have to get the element off of it that you want to click
[12:25:41] <smgs__> how ?
[12:25:56] <taplar> it's an array.  use [] notation
[12:26:33] <smgs__> trying
[12:27:37] <smgs__> please post the fiddle. thanks
[12:30:15] <taplar> i just told you want to do...
[12:30:22] <taplar> what's confusing?
[12:31:31] <smgs__> hmm.. noob here
[12:31:34] <smgs__> sorry

[12:44:40] <jakesyl> Hey, I'm having trouble with the $.ajax method, and in particular a callback here: despite a succesful response in the network tab (with the right content type, see: https://git.io/vwh4f for response), this (https://git.io/vwh4J) callback is never getting called, as nothing is logged
[12:44:53] <jak2000> hi all, wich is the property of an input for define the secuence of focus, when user press tab?
[12:45:20] <taplar> that will click it.  weither or not it does what you think that will cause to happen, to happen, is entirely different smgs__
[12:45:50] <smgs__> taplar ohhh okie. thanks. sorry.
[12:45:50] <taplar> jak2000: tabindex
[12:46:14] <taplar> jak2000: there may or maynot be a hyphen in it, but i don't think there is
[12:48:46] <taplar> lol
[12:48:54] <taplar> jakesyl: you have it as 'successs'
[12:49:03] <jakesyl> oh
[12:49:08] <taplar> ;)
[12:49:49] <jakesyl> thanks!
[12:50:40] <taplar> sure, i like those problems, :)
[13:00:12] <jak2013> friends how to do: i have 10 inputs on my form, the user have a excel file and select 10 rows, copy and in my Form i want receive these data when user press CTRL+V and fill the 10 inputs, how to do? thanks
[13:00:57] <taplar> uh.... lol
[13:01:27] <taplar> you'd have to do something with the paste event
[13:01:51] <jak2013> taplar wich words type in google?
[13:02:13] <taplar> maybe this: http://www.coderanch.com/t/118796/HTML-CSS-JavaScript/Copy-Paste-EXCEL-HTML-Text
[13:04:29] <jak2013> ok
[13:04:33] <jak2013> googling thanks
[13:23:08] <jak2013> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/v9j8prtg/
[13:24:23] <taplar> does it work?
[13:24:49] <jak2013> yes
[13:24:56] <jak2013> adapting to my project
[13:25:00] <taplar> awesome, :)
[13:27:14] <jak2013> taplar: $('input').bind('paste', function (e) {   is intodocument ready or out of document ready
[13:28:00] <taplar> you only need doc ready if your including your logic before the end of the body
[13:28:19] <taplar> read a little strange
[13:28:29] <jak2013> mmm not catch the event
[13:28:29] <taplar> if you put your logic at the very bottom of your page, you do not need a doc ready
[13:28:58] <jak2013> i am declare my .js file at the HEADER...
[13:29:09] <taplar> in <head></head> ?
[13:29:15] <jak2013> yes
[13:29:20] <taplar> then yes you need a doc ready
[13:29:27] <taplar> your body hasn't been loaded into the dom yet
[13:29:47] <jak2013> not catch the event paste
[13:29:56] <jak2013> i created the inputs on the fly dinamically
[13:30:08] <jak2013> then i do the paste data... and not catch :(
[13:30:11] <taplar> in that case you'll need to bind after you create them
[13:30:20] <taplar> or change it to be a delegate binding
[13:30:41] <taplar> what element are you dynamically creating those inputs in?
[13:31:22] <jak2013> with jsp(java), when users press a butto named: "btnConsultar"   <---- here created a html table with input fields in the cells
[13:31:39] <taplar> but what are you putting the new elements in?
[13:31:51] <taplar> are you just appending to the body, or are you appending to something else?
[13:32:58] <taplar> i assume those inputs belong to a form
[13:33:04] <jak2013> here my code: http://pastie.org/10828253
[13:33:10] <jak2013> yes
[13:33:34] <jak2013> line 15 create the html table/with inputs
[13:33:46] <taplar> ok, so that id is what the inputs are put in
[13:34:02] <taplar> so change your binding to $("#divembLiquida").on('paste', 'input', function(){ ...
[13:34:02] <Jagst3r15> hey taplar (:
[13:34:09] <taplar> yo
[13:34:25] <Jagst3r15> I figured out a way to replicate this issue I was discussing yesterday in the jsbin
[13:34:37] <taplar> is this the video question?
[13:34:46] <Jagst3r15> yeah unfortunatley
[13:34:50] <taplar> :)
[13:34:57] <Jagst3r15> i dont even think its me
[13:35:05] <Jagst3r15> i think all of these browsers handle html5 video differently
[13:35:06] <Jagst3r15> it sucks
[13:35:26] <taplar> wouldn't doubt it
[13:35:53] <taplar> i would assume they'd work towards the standards, but how they do it i'm sure is different
[13:35:58] <Jagst3r15> but to reproduce the issue in Chrome (latest version), if you let the videos play and go down the line answer false, ... and then finally click the true one, the video hangs...http://output.jsbin.com/bupifiruqa/1
[13:36:43] <Jagst3r15> weird thing is, this work in chrome canary
[13:36:51] <Jagst3r15> in crhome latest it borks
[13:37:27] <taplar> i only have ff on this box so i can't really play around with that right now, :(
[13:37:57] <Jagst3r15> oh ok
[13:38:00] <taplar> i did try to clean up your logic a bit yesterday though.  lets see if i can find it...
[13:38:27] <Jagst3r15> i mean everytime, whether on my local site or in jsbin, with chrome latest, it will say status pending in the network
[13:38:38] <Jagst3r15> and it says videoPlay.get(0).play(); is the initator
[13:38:41] <jak2013> taplar, testing
[13:38:58] <Jagst3r15> I was trying to check the chrome canary changelogs to see what might have changed but there are too many to sift through
[13:39:32] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/6Laszx5u/15/ <-- not saying I didn't jack up some of your logic perhaps, but it shouldn't be doing multiple bindings anymore
[13:40:40] <Jagst3r15> the fiddle doesn't work :p
[13:40:47] <Jagst3r15> the first video just hangs in chrome latest
[13:41:36] <jak2013> :( not catch the paste event
[13:43:08] <taplar> yeah, dunno what i fubared, but maybe it'll give you some ideas.  mainly the not doing bindings inside of other event handlers.  i'd be curious if that was affecting you any
[13:44:06] <taplar> oh snap, paste has crap browser support...
[13:44:10] <taplar> :(
[13:45:15] <jak2013> taplar i am catch not the paste event...
[13:45:40] <taplar> what browser are you in?
[13:48:24] <taplar> here's the mdn reference for it: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/paste
[13:48:30] <taplar> i'm going to go get some food in me.
[13:48:56] <taplar> worst case you can try binding to the body with a delegate and that should catch it.  if it doesn't, and you are  using a supported browser, you got another issue.

[14:56:25] <berpcor> Hello.
[14:57:10] <berpcor> Never used <script defer src="">. I always put scripts at the end of the body.
