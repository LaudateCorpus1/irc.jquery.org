[02:53:40] <dimi1947> I am having difficulty serializing only selected inputs of a form...I have found some info in the web but none solves my issue exactly...does anyones can help here?
[02:55:14] <dimi1947> I will provide some details...
[03:07:50] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 well
[03:07:55] <robertmaxrees> why do you want only selected inputs
[03:07:56] <robertmaxrees> ?
[03:40:20] <MLKKK> hi i have a peculiar problem.. so i have an url like this: url: window.location.origin+'/?_task=mail&_action=plugin.logout being called with ajax. the call goes through
[03:40:30] <MLKKK> but whatever that function has to do, doesn't get done.
[03:40:49] <MLKKK> if i run that url via browser, it gets executed properly.. the function
[03:41:25] <MLKKK> for some reason it doesn't get ..'properly' executed when called jquery ajax
[03:42:06] <MLKKK> i'm trying to implement hack around.. on close tab - kill the session
[03:42:58] <MLKKK> https://bpaste.net/show/ea6cc47371d6 this is the js code
[03:43:07] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:take a look at this fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/76ybhnkx/
[03:43:21] <dimi1947> click edit and then the plus icon
[03:44:01] <dimi1947> imagine the following scenarion
[03:44:05] <dimi1947> scenario
[03:46:18] <dimi1947> the user has allready filled some services and comes later at another point in time to add another service...if I serialize again all the form/inputs in the server will be sent services already contained in the db...and I do not want to do that...I want to send to the server only newly submitted services
[03:56:56] <lissitzki> hoi good morning
[03:57:28] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/65cc2aps/12/ still battling against this fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/65cc2aps/12/
[03:57:45] <lissitzki> in my site it works if i keep the href=#
[03:58:04] <lissitzki> if i change href to the actual links, it do not works anymore
[03:58:10] <lissitzki> any idea?
[04:11:50] <Woet> lissitzki: because the CSS won't stick when you load a new page..?
[04:12:00] <lissitzki> i think so
[04:12:23] <lissitzki> probably it apllied it before the page is load
[04:12:37] <Woet> lissitzki: if you navigate to a new page, the CSS/JS is reset.
[04:12:47] <Woet> lissitzki: i dont know why you're trying to do this with javascript instead of backend
[04:13:07] <lissitzki> wat do you suggest?
[04:14:07] <Woet> add the class in your backend?
[04:15:15] <lissitzki> but i need t change the class when element is clicked
[04:15:33] <lissitzki> or at least change the color
[04:15:54] <Woet> why?
[04:16:04] <Woet> if it's an actual link you'll be navigated away, no?
[04:17:35] <lissitzki> the menu will stay
[04:17:52] <Woet> yes, hence add the class in your backend.
[04:18:32] <lissitzki> sorry i can't see what you mean. a class in css?
[04:18:52] <Woet> does the link href lead to a new request?
[04:18:59] <Woet> a HTTP request.
[04:19:33] <lissitzki> yes
[04:19:49] <Woet> so why are you expecting this to work?
[04:20:03] <Woet> when you make a HTTP request, something on your backend writes this HTML
[04:20:05] <Woet> make it add the class.
[04:21:23] <lissitzki> Woet, i'm not software engineer, just want to add a color to the menu when the page is load. noteven sure it is another http request
[04:21:58] <Woet> lissitzki: if its a new request, use backend. if theres no new request, use frontend.
[04:22:06] <lissitzki> ok
[04:22:21] <lissitzki> Whenever your web browser fetches a file (a page, a picture, etc) from a web server, it does so using HTTP - that's "Hypertext Transfer Protocol".
[04:22:37] <Woet> you should probably learn some more about the basics of web development before attempting web development
[04:22:49] <lissitzki> i learn like this
[04:23:05] <lissitzki> thanks to you too
[04:23:07] <Woet> alright
[04:23:08] <Woet> no worries
[04:25:55] <lissitzki> ok so either css, jquery, either PHP
[04:26:32] <lissitzki> so the question is how am i sure if the link is another http request?
[04:26:40] <lissitzki> I may be out of topic though
[04:27:02] <Woet> lissitzki: what is the link?
[04:27:17] <lissitzki> is a link to another page of the site
[04:27:22] <Woet> lissitzki: okay, what is the link?
[04:27:36] <lissitzki> a href
[04:27:48] <Woet> ...
[04:27:52] <Woet> please copy and paste the link here
[04:29:10] <lissitzki> <a  href="{{ page.url }}"></a> where {{page.url}} is the link generated bu twig/PHP for every folder there is in the main page
[04:29:25] <lissitzki> it is actually a for loop that creates the links
[04:30:12] <lissitzki> so example <a  href="http://localhost/MALONE/contact"></a>
[04:30:43] <Woet> okay, in that example, it causes a new request
[04:31:06] <lissitzki> airght
[04:31:08] <Woet> most links will cause new requests unless a) it starts with # or 2) you have special JS that catches requests
[04:31:19] <lissitzki> got it
[04:32:11] <lissitzki> backend then
[04:32:18] <lissitzki> thanks
[05:43:04] <hellyeah> is there a setting in ajax for sending null value as empty string?
[05:43:15] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:53:16] <xenaxon> hello all !! Anyone here has worked with FabricJS?
[05:53:19] <xenaxon> need help!
[05:55:55] <xenaxon> im trying to extend the rectangle object
[05:55:57] <xenaxon> in fabricjs
[06:11:42] <hellyeah> is there jsfiddle for it
[06:11:49] <hellyeah> and how is related with jquery
[06:35:54] <xenaxon> hellyeah: https://jsfiddle.net/yu2wq75b/3/
[06:36:12] <xenaxon> hell yeah there's a jsfiddle!
[06:36:18] <xenaxon> :))
[06:36:56] <xenaxon> if you have'nt worked with fabricjs, forget it
[06:37:06] <xenaxon> don't thinkyou will understand much anyway
[06:37:10] <hellyeah> i am sure someone do
[06:37:23] <hellyeah> thats why i asked for jsfiddle?
[07:07:46] <dddh> hi
[07:08:05] <dddh> is it possible to cancel currently running $.getJSON ?
[07:08:40] <dddh> probably there should be some way to set global variables, in case it will load data, when it won't be needed
[07:08:45] <dddh> not to post process it ?
[08:10:30] <hellyeah> why can i assign white space to value part of element. look at console.log(x) i have white space https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/6L3m02xg/16/
[08:47:54] <MikeD_> why don't you expect to be able to have a literal space in an array?
[08:51:26] <MikeD_> if you want to remove the properties that have no value, you might want to use .reduce() instead of .map()
[10:19:40] <Renku> hi, could you look at this code please and tell me what could go wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/fcvrvxxa/
[10:20:48] <Renku> i try to simulate synchronous ajax call for this object but not blocking everything else, so i need to stay async but trigger only one query, then another one, then another one, etc.
[10:21:26] <Renku> but it seems that sometimes the behavior is not good and i have multiple query at the same time, or sometimes it seems to have deadlock, i don't understand why
[10:26:41] <Renku> maybe i should add a parameter to bypass the verification of a pending request, only to true when on the array shift part of the process, so the pending request never go back to false until the array is really empty...
[10:27:11] <Cork> Renku: why don't you just remove bPendingRequest and bake it into the aQueuedRequests?
[10:27:23] <Cork> what you prob are experiencing is a race
[10:27:37] <Cork> where the old event isn't fully complete when you request a new one
[10:28:46] <Renku> it's very strange 'cause in the log of the php side of the ajax call, it doesn't even complete before the next one is called
[10:29:19] <Renku> it's like "php 1 start, php 1 doing stuff, php 2 start, php 2 doing stuff, php 1 stop, php 2 stop"
[10:29:36] <Renku> (php in this case mean apache thread)
[10:29:52] <Cork> Renku: the problem might be from where your calling this code
[10:30:12] <Cork> cause this code expects very linear execution
[10:30:46] <Renku> yes, it may be a little candid
[10:31:05] <Cork> the problem is if what is calling it is sync async, or even cross processes
[10:31:19] <Cork> if it is the later you will have a race
[10:31:42] <Renku> the caller are buttons or events on the page
[10:31:52] <Renku> but they all go thru the same function
[10:32:08] <Cork> you think you could reproduce the problem in a jsfiddle?
[10:32:30] <Cork> it has an ajax resource you can post to if you like (/echo/json or /echo/html)
[10:32:56] <Cork> http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/echo.html (isn't documented for jquery, but you can do the same calls with jquery)
[10:33:01] <Renku> i don't know, it's kind of complicated, i can't reproduce it myself because it only has been experienced by my users, and the ajax call as something to do with phone calls...
[10:33:22] <Cork> ya, i would recommend playing with the delay value
[10:33:24] <Renku> when i did my tests it was ok but probably because i couldn't have more than one call at a time
[10:33:32] <Cork> cause i think response time for the server matters
[10:33:44] <Cork> ya, definitely
[10:34:08] <Cork> the problem sounds like a race and those are very hard to debug unless you trigger the criteria that causes the race
[10:34:25] <Renku> ok
[10:34:31] <Cork> but normally becomes very obvious when you do :)
[10:34:32] <Renku> i'll try to do some researches with this term
[10:34:46] <Renku> thanks a lot, very helpful ^^ i was a little stuck
[10:35:00] <Cork> for example experiment with double clicking the submit button or something like that
[10:35:15] <Cork> (instead of a straight click or two separate clicks)
[10:35:17] <Renku> (and the customer is a little PITA about problems of this kind, so they need quick answers, and so on... x) )
[10:35:47] <Cork> i've had problems with double clicking users quite a few times too, and it can cause the most strange problems
[10:35:50] <Renku> mh dbl clicking shouldn't be possible but i'll try that, they are very capable of doing this kind of stuff
[10:36:20] <Cork> and as what i handle is an order system... it wasn't enjoyed :)
[10:36:33] <Cork> "i ordered one but got two"
[10:37:12] <Renku> ahah yes i perfectly imagine that ^^ i work for telesecurity so it's more like "my grandma felt and you didn't get her sos call" ^^"
[10:37:40] <Renku> not answering in time an emergency call can be a little problematic =p
[10:37:55] <Cork> ya
[10:38:36] <Renku> anyway, thank you very much ^^ i need to go check all of this stuff =]
[10:38:52] <Cork> good luck, race hunting is not easy
[10:42:29] <taplar> i hate double clickers
[10:42:59] <Cork> specially ppl that double clicks everything
[10:43:25] <taplar> we have logic to stop it, and every now and then someone will do it some how in an older version of IE and we're like, how the hell did they do that?
[10:44:09] <Cork> disable on submit buttons and solving it that way is often quite effective
[10:44:36] <Cork> though ya, weird old browsers tend to be a mess
[10:45:02] <taplar> we got that.  the last one we encountered wasn't actually a user submit, but a logical submit that was happening in relation to an auto complete.  was a weird one
[10:45:23] <Cork> O_o
[10:45:27] <Cork> ugg
[13:29:04] <taplar> slow day
[13:30:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[13:45:29] <grapheti> Your face is slow!
[13:54:07] <taplar> :'(
[13:54:51] <grapheti> I bet that empty insult hurt.
[13:55:32] <taplar> It'd take you a while to see it, cause, ya know.  My face is slow
[13:55:43] <grapheti> LMAO
[13:56:05] <grapheti> It's like an inverse black hole.
[13:56:21] <taplar> I was thinking of that sloth character.
[13:56:37] <grapheti> HAHA
[13:57:05] <grapheti> https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e9/21/85/e92185e6e042a3dd8c4a8890d5960be4--sloth-memes-funny-memes.jpg
[13:57:21] <taplar> woah, hello warden
[13:57:36] <grapheti> :D
[14:02:06] <robertBusy> also: heh calm down a little bit here ;)
[14:40:25] <armlesshobo> when I make a request using: $.post({ url : '/my/url', data : JSON.stringify(folder) }); I notice that there is an '=' appended at the end of the JSON string
[14:40:31] <armlesshobo> anyone else ever see this?
[14:41:11] <taplar> not i
[14:41:53] <taplar> what if you do just console.log(JSON.stringify(folder)); .  Do you see it in the console?
[14:44:11] <armlesshobo> no
[14:44:34] <armlesshobo> i also noticed that the string the server receives in url-encoded data
[14:44:43] <armlesshobo> so I wonder if I need to set contentType to 'application/json'
[14:45:55] <robertBusy> you mean the post body is getting urlencoded?
[14:46:23] <armlesshobo> yes
[14:46:37] <armlesshobo> i did indeed have to add contentType
[14:46:42] <armlesshobo> that fixed the problem (yay!)
[14:47:21] <taplar> makes sense
[14:47:35] <armlesshobo> if contentType isn't specified, it defaults to application/x-www-form-urlencoded
[14:47:49] <armlesshobo> which is exactly what I was getting :)
[21:37:23] <mun> hi
[21:37:27] <mun> i'm trying to get all elements that are hidden. in jquery, i'd do $('[hidden]'), but what's the document.querySelectorAll() equivalent?
[21:37:33] <mun> i've tried docuemnt.querySelectorAll('[hidden]') but it returns different elements
[23:41:53] <darkhanb> So I'm trying to send a raw binary file via $.ajax: https://dpaste.de/Tpmr/raw
[23:42:57] <darkhanb> Even though I specify: contentType: false ajax option, the xhr's content-type is still: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryXuphMrct2AZHBm5j
[23:43:30] <darkhanb> how to send a binary file via $.ajax?
[23:55:29] <darkhanb> actually nevermind
[23:55:48] <darkhanb> I got it working by just passing the file itself, rather than in FormData
