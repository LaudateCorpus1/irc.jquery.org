[00:59:49] <cjohnson> there are lots of plugins
[00:59:57] <cjohnson> search editable grid, editable table, jquery grid, etc
[01:08:59] <shmoon_> is jquery mobile still used ? Is it a good idea to use them ?
[02:57:19] <paulvd> hello, i have a page, where a element is added to the page by a "plugin", now how can i detect that this element has been "added" to the page
[03:16:43] <lau_home> greetings, I am using an ajax call to get a json string. The updated html output is written via document.getElementById("xxx").innerHTML = the_var. The html output I created via js contains an id which i use an onclick event. it does appear the the onclick event is ignored/not run when the page is created via js, but works fine as 'pure html'
[03:17:01] <lau_home> any suggestions or pointers to look/google for?
[03:17:05] <lau_home> Thanks
[04:42:27] <paulvd> elseif doesnt work in jquery ?
[04:45:22] <paulvd> ok nevermind
[05:48:23] <ravigehl1t> On this code http://pastebin.com/aybVBZuG Lines 38 through 43. Why can't I computer the sum?
[07:50:21] <asahi> I'd like to find properties in an object based on some criteria. Is there a function that can help me with this?
[07:55:31] <Trisox> asahi: like http://underscorejs.org/#findKey ?
[07:55:33] <Trisox> or http://underscorejs.org/#has
[07:56:59] <Trisox> or just use a loop ;)
[07:57:22] <Trisox> for properties you can use http://underscorejs.org/#property
[07:57:22] <asahi> #findKey looks more like it. So I guess such a function doesn't exist in base js or jquery
[07:59:10] <Trisox> well you can write it your self ;)
[07:59:49] <Trisox> depending on your skill and understanding of javascript
[08:00:28] <Trisox> you could do a loop over your object easy :)
[08:00:45] <asahi> I just started using javascript, but since I've created some other functions, I guess I'll give it a shot
[09:04:50] <Rayon> I am loading a .php file into my page with jquery but javascript doenst work in it, what am i doing wrong?
[09:31:07] <Cork> ?paste @ Rayon
[09:31:08] <b-ot> Rayon: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:37:47] <Rayon> Cork, i think its more of a wordpress question then a jQuery one. jQuery is working fine but i cannot get the loaded file to display php data i think its something that has to do with wordlress
[09:37:47] <Trisox> hey Cork
[09:38:11] <Cork> o/
[09:38:17] <Trisox> how would i do this ? http://plnkr.co/edit/atRwtidPUAdzyera7Drm?p=preview ?
[09:40:38] <Cork> Trisox: uh?
[09:40:46] <Cork> you mean the script link in the headre?
[09:40:50] <Cork> *header?
[09:40:53] <Trisox> yea
[09:41:01] <Trisox> script on the left!
[09:41:12] <Cork> <script src="script.js"></script> <-- ?
[09:41:27] <Trisox> trying to merge 2 objects with key as parent object
[09:41:40] <Cork> there isn't any js on the page you linked
[09:41:40] <Trisox> press the links on the left
[09:41:40] <Trisox> :)
[09:41:47] <Cork> ah
[09:42:32] <Trisox> i just orderd a raspberry pie 2 :) going to set it up as build server :)
[09:42:35] <Trisox> going to be fun
[09:42:38] <Cork> Trisox: as you don't just want to merge the values it becomes complicated
[09:42:51] <Trisox> i know Cork
[09:43:04] <Cork> only option would be to recursively loop the objects
[09:43:09] <Uhkis> Trisox: i think raspberry pi 2 would make a better server ;D
[09:43:10] <Trisox> that wy i coulnt figure this out...
[09:43:17] <Cork> and have some form of logic for what should happen
[09:43:38] <Trisox> server with jenkins :)
[09:44:02] <Trisox> cork what do you mean
[09:44:20] <Cork> Trisox: $.each(obj1, function() {})
[09:44:30] <Cork> Trisox: rather $.each(obj1, function(key, value) {})
[09:44:30] <Trisox> i have working example that does something with an array but if i json.stringify that i get null's
[09:44:53] <Trisox> just merging is not the problem
[09:46:43] <Cork> Trisox: http://jsfiddle.net/wskytdk1/
[09:47:29] <Trisox> nice !
[09:47:50] <Trisox> was breaking my head about it...
[09:53:43] <checkit> Hey guys... How can I bind these items to the document? The fields are dynamically added in modals based on other conditions but the selectors aren't loaded: http://jsfiddle.net/c55gzzLr/
[09:55:47] <Cork> checkit: unless the "mask" plugin has support for dynamic elements, you can't
[09:55:56] <Cork> you would have to run it on elements as you add them
[09:56:10] <checkit> Cork: Ah. Makes sense.
[10:03:07] <Trisox> Cork:  you saved my day :) haha
[10:03:22] <Cork> heh, easy saved :)
[10:03:22] <Trisox> was kinda stuck.. there dont know wy :)
[10:03:44] <Cork> Trisox: i first thought you wanted nested objects
[10:03:53] <Cork> and THAT would have been a bit tricky to get right
[10:04:07] <Cork> i later noticed you just wanted to merge flat objects
[10:04:10] <Trisox> i know :)
[10:04:14] <Cork> and that's easy enough
[10:04:28] <Trisox> Cork: well thats when you see how then your DOHH!!!
[10:04:46] <Cork> :)
[10:05:04] <Trisox> been working to much latley brain bit fried...

[10:09:02] <reynierpm> how do I remove all the <br> inside .accordion element? I made this code but is not working http://jsbin.com/muqiqudeke/1/edit?html,js,output
[10:10:21] <Cork> reynierpm: the selector .remove takes is a filter
[10:10:27] <Cork> it doesn't search for children
[10:10:40] <Cork> $('.accordion br').remove()
[10:10:43] <Cork> is what you want
[10:14:30] <reynierpm> thanks Cork didnÂ´t notice that one

[10:25:10] <beasty> hehe Cork needs context!

What more, if on the server side I remove 'result' key from query, then 'pie' has a correct va
[10:44:07] <dziadu> I was reading console both in firefox and opera, both give consistent result
[10:46:16] <Cork> dziadu: shorter lines
[10:46:23] <Cork> your exceeding the max length
[10:47:01] <Cork> (in irc i meant)
[10:47:12] <dziadu> Cork: ahhh :)
[10:47:22] <dziadu> hi, I am using jQuery function getJSON to fetch data, my callback JSON format is correct
[10:47:27] <dziadu> here is output http://pastebin.com/AhWTA145 , I used validator to  check it
[10:47:37] <dziadu> t array of one
[10:47:46] <dziadu> it has two keys, 'result' and 'pie', 'pie' should be array of two elements, but when I print whole json query using console.log I am getting that  pie is just array of one,
[10:47:54] <dziadu> only first key is there. What more, if on the server side I remove 'result' key from query, then 'pie' has a correct value of array  of two elements.
[10:47:57] <dziadu> Any ideas why is like that and how to fix it?
[10:49:42] <maddtech> http://kopy.io/Hej4XI've got the following code written but it's not returning anything, any ideas why?
[10:50:06] <maddtech> http://kopy.io/Hej4X
[10:50:14] <maddtech> Bad link at first, sorry.
[10:52:09] <Cork> dziadu: your json looks weird
[10:52:52] <Cork> dziadu: i would recommend running the json through a pretty pring
[10:52:57] <Cork> *print
[10:54:32] <dziadu> Cork: json should be ok, is generated from django by json.dumps()
[10:55:12] <Cork> dziadu: ya, to much nesting so had a hard time reading it
[10:55:20] <Cork> data.pie should work fine
[10:55:41] <dziadu> Cork: pretty print shows it is also ok
[10:55:55] <Cork> data.pie should work fine <--
[10:57:04] <dziadu> Cork: is it to me?
[10:57:15] <Cork> yes
[10:59:54] <dziadu> Cork: I don't know what is data.pie
[11:00:01] <Cork> dziadu: one min
[11:02:45] <Cork> gah...

[11:07:13] <Cork> dziadu: http://jsfiddle.net/5gjb308L/
[11:07:26] <Cork> had to go with json instead of jsonp cause jsfiddle is weird
[11:07:33] <Cork> but it should work the same way
[11:09:09] <Cork> madebymarkca: contentType: "application/json", dataType: "jsonp", <-- these two contradicts each other

[11:15:45] <dziadu> Cork: I ha error: SyntaxError: invalid property id
[11:16:28] <Cork> in the fiddle?
[11:17:27] <dziadu> Cork: in the fiddle not, but then also no output... or this should be the result?
[11:17:44] <Cork> dziadu: in the browser console
[11:18:29] <ashopin> Hello everyone. I feel like I'm going crazy. I can't get 'jQuery(document).ready(function() {});' to work on this site. In jsfiddle it works, the JS file is loaded, it just never fires.
[11:18:52] <Cork> ashopin: you would have to share a link
[11:19:27] <ashopin> Cork: I can't even get a console.log or alert to work
[11:19:48] <Cork> ashopin: you mean you get no output in the console from the fiddle?
[11:20:00] <ashopin> Cork: I do in fiddle, but not on my site
[11:20:05] <Cork> ah
[11:20:10] <ashopin> I know the code is fine, I just can't figure out why it won't work on my site
[11:20:12] <Cork> is the done callback called at all?
[11:20:40] <dziadu> Cork: yes, before there was not, but now I have, and result is correct, so why is not correct in my js script?
[11:21:09] <Cork> dziadu: just console.log the response variable and work from there
[11:21:50] <ashopin> Cork: how can I check that?
[11:21:58] <Cork> uh
[11:22:04] <Cork> console.log(variable) ?
[11:24:38] <dziadu> Cork: maybe you didn't get what I meant, your example in fiddle works OK, is correct, but still I don;t know why it does not work in my code, here is code http://pastebin.com/rRCHXDbe
[11:24:45] <ortund> trying to build a tooltip into my site using jquery-ui and getting an error saying object doesn't support property or method, can someone take a look and help me out? http://pastebin.com/PB2YWUQt
[11:25:14] <BostonGeorge2k> how do i prevent my button from refreshing the site, iam trying to create some ajax script
[11:25:17] <Cork> dziadu: what does those console calls give you?
[11:25:36] <Cork> BostonGeorge2k: <button type="button">
[11:25:51] <Cork> the default type if you don't set it is submit
[11:26:23] <ortund> Cork the first thing I thought when I saw <button type="button"> is "I really hate those eggplant type buttons"
[11:26:44] <Cork> O_o
[11:26:50] <BostonGeorge2k> Cork thanks but in this case my code is not firing anymore: $("#login-form").on("submit", function(event) {
[11:27:02] <ortund> <button type="button"> seems redundant to me :/
[11:27:08] <Cork> BostonGeorge2k: ah, so you want to have submit
[11:27:17] <Cork> just not submit the form (do ajax instead?)
[11:27:31] <BostonGeorge2k> hmmm: /
[11:27:45] <Cork> if yes, just do event.preventDefault() in the submit event
[11:27:46] <ortund> I've only ever done it successfully in MVC
[11:27:50] <ortund> @ ajax post
[11:28:09] <Cork> ortund: <button></button> === <button type="submit"></button>
[11:28:23] <Cork> so ya type="button" isn't redundant
[11:28:42] <Cork> if you don't want a submit button that is :)
[11:28:46] <BostonGeorge2k> ok thanks, works :)
[11:29:49] <Cork> ortund: you need to share what the property with the error is
[11:30:03] <Cork> meaning the full error message
[11:31:23] <ortund> Cork that's all I'm getting... the pastebin contains a full copypasta of the error message
[11:31:37] <ortund> Unhandled exception at line 137, column 9 in http://localhost:52039/Company
[11:31:37] <ortund> 0x800a01b6 - Microsoft JScript runtime error: Object doesn't support this property or method
[11:31:53] <Cork> ah, microsoft
[11:31:58] <Cork> run in a real browser :)
[11:32:14] <ortund> the browser doesn't show me the error, visual studio does... the site is MVC
[11:32:22] <Cork> heh...
[11:32:35] <Cork> well there isn't enough info to answer the question
[11:32:43] <Cork> as i don't know where the error is from what you share
[11:33:45] <ortund> Google Chrome says "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function"
[11:33:53] <ortund> seems like it doesn't know what .tooltip is
[11:34:21] <Cork> ya
[11:34:25] <Cork> your missing the plugin
[11:35:42] <dziadu> Cork: ok, it must be some bug in Firefox or so... if I do console.log(jsondata.pie) I get array of 1, but if I do explicit console.log(jsondata.pie[0]) nad console.log(jsondata.pie[1]) I am getting correct values
[11:36:10] <ortund> dunno how I can be missing a plugin that's built into jquery-ui which is referenced...
[11:36:27] <Cork> dziadu: try console.log(typeof jsondata.pie[0])
[11:36:40] <Cork> dziadu: and actually console.log(typeof jsondata.pie)
[11:36:45] <Cork> might be pie is a string for you
[11:37:24] <ortund> do I have to match my jquery version to my jquery-ui version?
[11:37:48] <ul71m0> I have a product page with carousel, when i change color of the product it loads new images with Ajax, but than my carousel javascript inst loaded until i refresh the page. Anyone have an idea how to fix this
[11:38:03] <dziadu> Cork: is object
[11:38:28] <Cork> dziadu: and console.log(jsondata.pie.length)
[11:38:53] <Cork> dziadu: i can tell you one thing, it isn't a browser bug
[11:39:04] <Cork> this is just js so not likely at all
[11:39:08] <dziadu> Cork: is 2, so is correct
[11:40:04] <Cork> hmm
[11:40:13] <Cork> you have a link?
[11:41:06] <dziadu> for now it runs on my localhost, is not published
[11:41:14] <dziadu> *deployed
[11:41:51] <Cork> well all i can say is console.log(jsondata.pie) and work from there
[11:43:53] <dziadu> Cork: yeak, if I wont find solution I will find you again soon, I will deploy code to public, you can have a look on it then, thx a lot for your time and help
[11:44:09] <Cork> dziadu: np
[11:46:54] <bl4ckdu5t> Hi Cork
[11:47:36] <nonconvergent> Hey, working on a webapp that has jquery validator plugin on it.  I'm trying to see what the current rules on a page is (have to look because it's inheriting so much stuff I can't even look at it).
[11:48:03] <Iota> Hey guys, real basic question about jQueryUI coming at you. So I understand in jquery you can use .html() on an element and update the html. But what about after you've themed it using jQueryUI? It obviously removes all those special widget atributes. Is there a "correct" way in jQueryUI to update the content without modifying the theme?
[11:48:10] <Iota> Oh wait, do I mean to use innerHTML?
[11:51:32] <mrkie> irccloud.com died
[11:51:54] <Iota> Nope, I don't think I figured out my solution.
[12:01:14] <ortund> Cork, I got it working, except now my tooltip displays, but since it makes use of the title attribute, the brower's tooltip covers it lol
[12:01:25] <ortund> at least in IE anyway
[12:01:50] <Cork> ortund: jquery-ui tooltip is removing the tooltip attribute when it runs
[12:01:57] <Cork> so that shouldn't happen
[12:02:55] <ortund> Cork trying the jquery-ui option was causing too many other problems so I took another option
[12:12:05] <sadaN> After wrapping an element with a div, if I use .remove on the div, the the element originally wrapped remains, does anyone know how to prevent that?
[12:13:29] <Cork> sadaN: sounds like the element is cloned
[12:13:42] <Cork> cause that isn't default behavior
[12:14:29] <sadaN> $( "#dialog" ).dialog().parent(".ui-dialog").wrap("<div class='myClass'></div>");
[12:14:43] <sadaN> if i do $(".myclass").remove()
[12:14:51] <sadaN> #dialog remains
[12:15:05] <Cork> what you're doing there is risky
[12:15:10] <Cork> as .dialog() moved #dialog
[12:15:22] <Cork> so you might be moving the dialog out of the wrapper
[12:15:47] <Cork> sadaN: also i would do $('#dialog').dialog().dialog('widget').wrap()
[12:15:57] <sadaN> I see, the reason why I do that, is to tell which css scope theme i want to use within this div
[12:16:01] <Cork> after that make sure the dom structure is correct
[12:16:26] <Cork> sadaN: why not just set a class on the widget?
[12:16:34] <Cork> sadaN: also i would do $('#dialog').dialog().dialog('widget').addClass()
[12:16:38] <Cork> opps
[12:16:44] <Cork> sadaN:* $('#dialog').dialog().dialog('widget').addClass()
[12:16:45] <sadaN> one .dialog()
[12:16:48] <sadaN> ?
[12:16:49] <Cork> no two
[12:16:56] <sadaN> why two .dialog()?
[12:17:02] <Cork> the first to initiate it the second to get the widget
[12:17:19] <sadaN> alright, let me try that
[12:17:52] <Cork> basically .parent('ui-dialog') => .dialog('widget
[12:18:11] <Cork> the later one is safer cause it asks the plugin to give you the wrapping widget
[12:19:36] <sadaN> $('#dialog').dialog().dialog('widget').addClass("class"); - caused some weird behaviours
[12:20:05] <sadaN> and when I removed .class, #dialog remained
[12:20:27] <Cork> O_o
[12:25:30] <Cork> ooh...
[12:25:34] <Cork> that's nasty
[12:26:13] <Cork> uh... hmm
[12:26:22] <Cork> man i can't get my head around this...
[12:27:05] <Cork> sadaN: the only thing i can think of is that dialog hooks into the remove callback from jquery
[12:27:22] <Cork> and moves the element back to its original position when you remove the widget element
[12:27:40] <Cork> this is new behavior to me, it sure didn't do this last i checked
[12:27:57] <sadaN> hold on
[12:27:59] <sadaN> making a fiddle here
[12:28:08] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/s289v8sc/
[12:28:15] <Cork> already have one :)
[12:29:24] <sadaN> http://jsfiddle.net/624wu6dz/
[12:29:31] <sadaN> it works as expected here
[12:30:05] <Cork> sure, your not using .dialog
[12:30:15] <Cork> the behavior change is cause of dialog
[12:31:09] <sadaN> it worked fine in your fiddle as well
[12:31:11] <sadaN> did it not/
[12:31:12] <sadaN> ?
[12:36:51] <Cork> sadaN: no the #dialog is still in the page after the remove
[12:37:09] <sadaN> didnt check that
[13:05:00] <ul71m0> I have a product page with carousel, when i change color of the product it loads new images with Ajax, but than my carousel javascript inst loaded until i refresh the page. Anyone have an idea how to fix this
[13:08:18] <skypce> hey guys
[13:08:30] <skypce> how can i disable :hover in a element?
[13:11:07] <Cork> set the style the :hover would change internally
[13:11:18] <Cork> or set a class with higher precision
[13:15:57] <skypce> thank you Cork
[13:16:02] <skypce> please give me an idea
[13:16:03] <skypce> http://skypce-sandbox.com/urbantrafficschool/www.urbantrafficschool.info/index.html
[13:16:20] <skypce> in responsive view mobile the "about" item , i need remove the hover
[13:17:23] <skypce> i will BACK IN A MOMENT
[14:13:45] <skypce> how can i disable :hover event via jquery*?
[14:14:03] <Cork> skypce: already answered that
[14:33:38] <skypce> hey guys
[14:33:42] <skypce> i need something like this
[14:33:50] <skypce> can i paste 1 row of code?
[14:34:24] <skypce> $('.disable-hover').off('hover');
[14:34:31] <skypce> doesnt work
[14:34:32] <skypce> :S
[14:34:48] <Cork> skypce: why do you ask a question if you don't read the answers?
[14:35:30] <skypce> set the style the :hover would change internally
[14:35:32] <skypce> you say it
[14:35:36] <Cork> yes
[14:35:39] <Cork> that is the only way
[14:35:51] <skypce> i was changed inside of hover
[14:35:51] <Cork> :hover is a psudo-class selector
[14:35:57] <skypce> display:block display:none
[14:36:01] <Cork> only way to override its styling is to be more specific
[14:36:01] <skypce> nothing works
[14:36:18] <skypce> sure
[14:36:24] <skypce> but this time the problem is more complex
[14:36:36] <skypce> i was all day trying to fix it
[14:37:07] <Cork> .off is for events, it has no effect what so ever on psudo selectors
[15:59:47] <pilgrimish> in my fiddle, the play button successfully plays the video at every click. http://jsfiddle.net/Pilgrimish/k5z4w572/41/ on my site, however, it takes two clicks to play. http://www.beaconnected.com/ng_site/ any thoughts?
[16:03:07] <BillCriswell> pilgrimish: Worked on first click for me.
[16:03:12] <BillCriswell> Certain browser?
[16:03:15] <pilgrimish> chrome maybe
[16:03:24] <BillCriswell> I used Chrome.
[16:03:44] <pilgrimish> first click works, but after it pauses once, did it take 1 or 2 to play it again?
[16:04:16] <BillCriswell> Works throughout for me.
[16:04:32] <BillCriswell> Do you have a browser plugin or something that could be causing issues
[16:04:33] <BillCriswell> ?
[16:04:41] <BillCriswell> Might want to try it incognito.
[16:10:29] <pilgrimish> BillCriswell: ok. youâve helped narrow it down. when the browserâs narrower than 768, i have the button set to display: noneâ¦ once itâs hidden, and the video pauses, upon displaying again, it then takes 2 clicks to play the video again.
[16:11:42] <pilgrimish> but not in the fiddle
[16:12:39] <BillCriswell> pilgrimish: That titles to the right of the video view are blocking the play button it looks like.
[16:14:14] <pilgrimish> the vimeo play button, yea, but not the one above the videoâ¦ or at least not that iâm seeing
[16:17:22] <pilgrimish> iâve removed that style from the media query so the hiding occurs in desktop viewâ¦ when the âplayâ button is used (the one above the video), upon 2nd click (itâs set to display none after itâs 1st click), it takes 2 clicks to play the video
[16:17:35] <BillCriswell> pilgrimish: If I hide .videoContent I can click it no problem.
[16:18:00] <BillCriswell> So you want to hide the info and play the video in one click?
[16:18:36] <vinex08> good day guys!... http://jsfiddle.net/vinex08/tXcUX/5/    i have a problem with my toggle sign.. how can the sign revert back to 'plus' button when untoggled?
[16:19:34] <pilgrimish> yea, iâve already got that covered. i want the play button (not the vimeo play button) to play the video upon a single click the way it does the first time
[16:20:43] <pilgrimish> the play button with class of âplay"
[16:22:03] <pilgrimish> and the way it does in jsfiddleâ¦ the site and the fiddle are configured identically
[16:26:48] <pilgrimish> broke somethingâ¦ it seems that setting it to display none interferes with the click action...
[16:28:12] <vinex08> anyone ?
[16:32:39] <Valduare> hey guys     if ($("#resultscount:contains('0')")) {       what did I do wrongâ¦. I have a <span id=âresultscount>     that I am inserting a number into to show â¦ the results count      im trying to make an if statement  if its 0   then do this    else   show the other stuff   but     if ($("#resultscount:contains('0')")) {       is running if its 0 or any other value in there...
[16:33:21] <BillCriswell> Valduare: You would need to do .length
[16:33:42] <BillCriswell> Also, that would select it even if it has like 100.
[16:34:05] <Valduare> im using php to fill in the value so its just a string as far as js sees it.
[16:34:10] <Valduare> that was another question
[16:34:18] <Valduare> how can I define JUST 0  and not 20  or 100
[16:35:15] <BillCriswell> $('#resultcount').text().trim() == "0"
[16:35:45] <BillCriswell> If you need older browser support $.trim($('#resultcount').text()) == "0"
[16:36:00] <Valduare> can you translate what that does
[16:36:07] <Valduare> will help me learn if its in english :)
[16:36:33] <BillCriswell> It trims white space off the ends of the text inside the element.
[16:37:33] <BillCriswell> If your html is like <div id="resultcount"> 0</div> it would test "0" and not " 0"
[16:37:55] <Valduare> ah so a little error checking in there
[16:38:03] <BillCriswell> Yeah.
[16:38:13] <BillCriswell> "    0  ".trim() -> "0"
[16:40:15] <Valduare> hmm
[16:40:20] <Valduare> its still not working quite right
[16:40:30] <Valduare> it successfully fired the else statement I have now
[16:40:48] <Valduare> but if it âmatchesâ  its not firing the if
[16:42:24] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: http://jsbin.com/kaduhi/1/edit?html,js,output
[16:42:41] <vinex08> ehem
[16:44:41] <Valduare> oh haha BillCriswell missed an s  on results
[16:44:45] <Valduare> its working!
[16:44:59] <BillCriswell> Awesome.
[16:45:08] <Valduare> onto more bugs heh
[16:45:15] <vinex08> good day guys!... http://jsfiddle.net/vinex08/tXcUX/5/    i have a problem with my toggle sign.. how can the sign revert back to 'plus' button when untoggled?
[16:45:16] <Valduare> are you familiar with leaflet  by chance
[16:45:26] <Valduare> maping js
[16:49:16] <BillCriswell> Valduare: I am not.
[16:50:20] <pilgrimish> vinex08: iâm no pro, but i think the key to your solution lies in the fact that there is no untoggle
[16:50:27] <pilgrimish> so iâd say you probably need an if/else
[16:56:02] <BillCriswell> vinex08: You'll have to look to see if sidebar-sub is isible after the toggle and update it based on that.
[16:59:20] <Valduare> BillCriswell: ok
[17:01:02] <pilgrimish> BillCriswell: any thoughts on the play button?
[17:01:05] <Velveeta> bill: what's that jsbin post about?
[17:01:30] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: A typo.
[17:01:46] <Velveeta> gotcha
[17:01:48] <BillCriswell> pilgrimish: A little too involved for me right now. Feeling kind of lazy.
[17:17:50] <danskubr> wgat does this means?  get_field( "make_an_appointment_link", $home_page->ID ); when i have $home_page = get_page_by_title('home');
[17:18:33] <danskubr> ops
[17:18:35] <danskubr> wrong window
[18:34:25] * donkeyBalls hello
[18:34:42] <donkeyBalls> how goes it?
[19:05:20] <vinex08>  $(this).find.("ul.sidebar-sub").slideToggle(500);    - what's wrong with this?
[19:20:10] <alex613> any of you guys use Angular much?
[19:26:40] <vinex08> http://jsfiddle.net/vinex08/tXcUX/8/     help? when i press the toggle button all sub menu appears
[19:27:28] <robertmaxrees> vinex08 because your click event handler is bound to the document.
[19:27:37] <robertmaxrees> you want a delegated listener on the UL.
[19:28:43] <robertmaxrees> also your preventDefault() call isn;t doing anything.
[19:28:52] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tXcUX/9/ try this.
[19:30:54] <vinex08> but the link on the leftside got removed :(
[19:31:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:31:14] <vinex08> the parent link shud have a link
[19:31:20] <vinex08> parent li*
[19:31:27] <robertmaxrees> so what do you want?
[19:31:54] <vinex08> have a link on the parent li , then when i press + sign... the submenu comes down
[19:32:03] <robertmaxrees> i'd reconsider that approach.
[19:32:09] <robertmaxrees> doable, but a little awkware.
[19:33:00] <robertmaxrees> if you want it to only be on that + sign, pass "span" as the second arg to the binding.
[19:33:05] <robertmaxrees> instead of li.
[19:33:27] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to redo the function body in that case.
[19:34:30] <vinex08> ill try that, jsut a minute
[19:36:46] <vinex08> $('.sidebar-list').on('click', 'span.sign', function (e) {
[19:36:48] <vinex08> like this?
[19:37:03] <robertmaxrees> just use .sign, but basically.
[19:38:51] <vinex08> .sign doesnt work ... i dont understand why
[19:39:00] <vinex08> $('.sidebar-list').on('click', '.sign', function (e) {
[19:39:12] <robertmaxrees> because your function body isn't right any more
[19:39:16] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is the span tjhat was clicked.
[19:39:37] <robertmaxrees> so you need to redo your dom traversal there.
[19:40:33] <vinex08> do i need to change the strcuture in the html?
[19:40:37] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:40:41] <robertmaxrees> just the javascript.
[19:40:46] <vinex08> Ok ill try again
[19:40:50] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tXcUX/11/ like this.
[19:41:34] <robertmaxrees> though i'm not sure you need that preventDefault() any more really.
[19:42:24] <vinex08> because there's no # in there right>
[19:42:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:42:32] <vinex08> so i dont need it then?
[19:42:44] <robertmaxrees> you normally use that to stop you from going to a link.
[19:42:48] <robertmaxrees> spans aren't links.
[19:43:56] <vinex08> Oh yeah! :) they are jsut text.
[19:44:12] <robertmaxrees> sorta, yeah.
[19:45:39] <vinex08> speaking of text..  http://jsfiddle.net/vinex08/tXcUX/12/    how can i revert it back into a + text?
[19:45:45] <vinex08> it stays in minus
[19:46:14] <vinex08> i guess i have to use slideUp and down this time?
[19:46:26] <vinex08> not slideToggle?
[19:47:49] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'd do.  i'd use a class or data attribute and go from there.
[19:48:01] <vinex08> if else statement?  if $(this) is in slideDown state then  text= minus    else vice versa
[19:48:03] <vinex08> correct?
[19:48:13] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[19:48:51] <vinex08> i mean if the sidebar-sub closest to the span i just clicked is in down state etc...
[19:49:37] <ss_> im using jquery autocomplete.. and using jsonp to get data back. i get the data back fine but i want to send back a response ewith label and value.. the data i get from the ajax call is an array. im currently using $.map to just return the values, but how do i return an array of {label: .. and value: ...} ?
[19:50:27] <robertmaxrees> vinex08 yeah, you get the idea
[19:50:42] <robertmaxrees> ss_ that's not an array.
[19:50:46] <robertmaxrees> that'd be an object.
[19:51:44] <ss_> http://pastebin.com/mwiV38D0
[19:51:59] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's an object.
[19:52:04] <ss_> ...
[19:52:12] <ss_> i need to return array of objects in that format
[19:52:14] <robertmaxrees> you want to create an object with a label and value property.
[19:52:25] <ss_> no i need to create an array of objects
[19:52:27] <robertmaxrees> aaaah i get it.
[19:53:11] <ss_> yea
[19:53:28] <ss_> currently it works fine.. but that sets the label and value as the same
[19:53:30] <ss_> which i dont need
[19:53:31] <robertmaxrees> as far as sending data, you can post it in that success callback.  you can $.map() if you want, though if you don't need to support old IE you can just use the native map array.
[19:54:02] <vinex08> http://prntscr.com/68p72j  what's the correct code for this?
[19:54:15] <robertmaxrees> you need to return {label: city.name, value: city.whatever} ss_
[19:54:18] <ss_> i need to send it in a specific format otherwise autocomplete wont recognize it robertmaxrees
[19:54:23] <ss_> o
[19:54:45] <robertmaxrees> vinex08 use a data attribute
[19:55:00] <robertmaxrees> .data('slidestate')
[19:55:06] <robertmaxrees> and put that in the event handler, not outside.
[19:55:27] <vinex08> is hidden!?
[19:55:34] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:55:39] <ss_> robertmaxrees, yeah that worked. thanks
[19:55:53] <ss_> was having brainfart.. also i rarely use $.map since we use _ mostly
[19:55:59] <robertmaxrees> ss_ rad - sorry for the misunderstanding earlier :)
[19:56:12] <robertmaxrees> and ah.  you should check out the native .map() btw.
[19:57:06] <ss_> yeah np.  most people on irc just try to find mistakes or be pedantic but i think this was just an honest misunderstanding.
[19:57:11] <ss_> hmm let me check
[19:57:20] <robertmaxrees> yeah no totally.
[19:57:30] <ss_> but .map is what i should use right?
[19:57:35] <ss_> for what im trying to do
[19:57:40] <ss_> or is there a better/cleaner way?
[19:57:50] <robertmaxrees> .map() is what you want.
[19:57:58] <robertmaxrees> the native map isn't supported in IE8 but you can just use the es5 shim.
[19:58:11] <vinex08> here's my atttempt http://jsfiddle.net/vinex08/tXcUX/13/
[19:58:40] <robertmaxrees> vinex08 in the event handler.
[19:58:43] <ss_> yeah i dont care about ie8
[19:58:46] <robertmaxrees> your code doesn't make any sense right now.
[19:58:47] <ss_> yeah im using native map now
[19:58:51] <robertmaxrees> also, it's $(this), vinex08
[19:58:53] <robertmaxrees> ss_ awesome.
[19:59:04] <ss_> im teaching a class.. i do mostly backend so im a bit rusty on frontend so catching up on it.
[19:59:10] <ss_> so i wanna set good examples
[19:59:11] <robertmaxrees> ss_ aaaah nice.
[19:59:30] <robertmaxrees> i did a few trainings at work on JS and how to not screw it up, so if you need anything, lemme know
[20:00:00] <vinex08> aargghhhhh
[20:01:14] <ss_> yeah sure, appreciate it
[20:02:48] <vinex08> my if else attempt doesnt make sense
[20:04:02] <robertmaxrees> show your code.
[20:05:06] <vinex08> http://jsfiddle.net/vinex08/tXcUX/14/
[20:05:22] <robertmaxrees> your code isn;t in the event handler.
[20:05:28] <robertmaxrees> and that's not how you want to check.
[20:07:37] <vinex08> your code isn;t in the event handler.  <-- ok moved it in there
[20:07:44] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[20:07:58] <vinex08> and that's not how you want to check. <-- how?  is hidden and is visible not a good idea?
[20:08:07] <vinex08> http://jsfiddle.net/vinex08/tXcUX/15/
[20:08:28] <robertmaxrees> use data attributes.
[20:08:32] <robertmaxrees> and get rid of the old code.
[20:08:49] <robertmaxrees> one sec.  you're makfing this too hard :)
[20:10:20] <vinex08> sure
[20:10:48] <vinex08> once i have completed this, this will be very usefull for sure
[20:11:10] <robertmaxrees> start with this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tXcUX/16/
[20:11:35] <robertmaxrees> if groupstate is undefined or "collapsed", you want to slide down, otherwise you want to slide up.
[20:12:47] <vinex08> ill start with that, thanks for the tips: im just gonna grab something to eat.. :)
[20:12:56] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[20:40:03] <vinex08> im back!
[21:06:12] <jquerycss-help> Is there a way to set a line height based on window height?
[21:06:46] <jquerycss-help> I'm trying to vertically align a few buttons
[21:12:27] <jquerycss-help> nvm just figurd my own question after asking it.
[22:06:09] <caper> Hey is there any familiar with Bandwidth DID
[22:06:23] <caper> i want to know how can i order specific numbers
[22:39:08] <NinjaBanjo> using jQuery, how would one check if .item is before .line or after .line
[22:40:35] <Cork> NinjaBanjo: if($(this).prev('.line').length > 0)
[22:40:42] <Cork> if you want to check from the element it self
[22:40:52] <Cork> that only checks direct sibling though
[22:40:53] <NinjaBanjo> Cork: I though .prev gets the last selector selected
[22:41:02] <Cork> no
[22:41:05] <NinjaBanjo> okay.
[22:41:10] <Cork> ?api prev
[22:41:10] <b-ot> Cork: .prev(): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[22:41:12] <NinjaBanjo> I'll have a gander at the docs
[22:42:39] <NinjaBanjo> Cork: beautiful, thanks
[23:40:38] <pilgrimish> looking to work out why my button requires a 2nd click after displaying none
[23:40:45] <pilgrimish> http://www.beaconnected.com/ng_site/
[23:48:46] <Cork> pilgrimish: at least link to the code...
[23:48:59] <Cork> but preferably create a fiddle showing the problem
[23:50:00] <pilgrimish> well, thatâs the key issue (figured no one would respond so i didnât expand)
[23:50:13] <pilgrimish> in the fiddle, it works fine
[23:50:14] <pilgrimish> http://jsfiddle.net/Pilgrimish/k5z4w572/42/
[23:50:27] <Cork> pilgrimish: never require user to ask for the question
[23:50:40] <Cork> even if you have to repeat it a few times before someone answers
[23:50:50] <g33kyboi> I want to test the amount of resources it takes for a mobile device to load a particular web app, any known application that I can use to achieve this? (By resources I mean; time, size of entire response, amount of mobile data consumed, etc.)
[23:51:15] <pilgrimish> g33kyboi: maybe yslow?
[23:51:23] <pilgrimish> and Cork: noted
[23:56:14] <Cork> pilgrimish: where do you have to click twice?
[23:56:21] <Cork> works fine here
[23:57:59] <pilgrimish> Cork: sorry, narrow it down to 768 or less and youâll see the custom play button
[23:58:20] <Cork> ...
