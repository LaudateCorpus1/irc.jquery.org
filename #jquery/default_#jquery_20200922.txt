[03:45:11] <jquery743> hi guys
[03:45:47] <robertmaxrees> hello!
[03:45:53] <jquery743> i have a very burning question - how do i insert a <template> contents as a custom html tag (no dashes)?
[03:46:26] <jquery743> (don't care about validity)
[03:46:57] <robertmaxrees> sorry - huh?  got a fiddle or something?  need more context.
[03:47:16] <jquery743> currently this https://jsfiddle.net/aolko/x6hv3L1n/1/
[03:47:31] <jquery743> i need that template as <mytag/>
[03:47:55] <robertmaxrees> did you mean to ask in ##javascript?
[03:48:15] <jquery743> no, so far i want to do it __scpecifically__ in jquery
[03:48:21] <jquery743> specifically*
[03:48:30] <robertmaxrees> none of your code is using jquery :|
[03:49:16] <jquery743> currently none, yet still
[03:49:43] <robertmaxrees> okay
[03:49:59] <robertmaxrees> so where's your code trying to use a template tag?
[03:50:17] <jquery743> html frame
[03:51:05] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue?
[03:51:55] <jquery743> > i need that template as <mytag/>
[03:51:58] <jquery743> not appended
[03:52:11] <robertmaxrees> you're not making sense heh.
[03:52:31] <robertmaxrees> please be more specific.
[03:55:45] <jquery743> alright let me reiterate, do you see a code sample on this page http://x-tag.github.io/v1/ ? I'm trying to achieve th same thing here, except with template that stores the html and css as well
[03:56:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[03:56:33] <robertmaxrees> can you please be more specific?
[03:58:05] <jquery743> instead of passing the html and css via .register method i want to use a <template> with an id or a class
[03:58:37] <robertmaxrees> you're repeating things you've already said.
[03:59:07] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like your jsfiddle example isn't complete
[03:59:23] <jquery743> because it's relying heavily on you browsing that link and looking at the api docs
[04:00:19] <robertmaxrees> back up - start from the beginning
[04:04:44] <jquery743> let's say i have this template, alright https://paste.ee/p/y2CKn#7irBxczy6JTLEZrFEn10ADE0zehq8HbV
[04:05:27] <jquery743> the next thing i want to do with it is __mount__ it as __an html tag__, let's say <mytag/>
[04:05:50] <Cork> jquery743: you really, really don't want to have script tags like that, it requires eval to work
[04:06:02] <jquery743> trust me, i need that
[04:06:02] <robertmaxrees> ^
[04:06:23] <robertmaxrees> jquery743 none of your code has used jquery to this point.
[04:06:25] <robertmaxrees> so.
[04:06:27] <robertmaxrees> wat
[04:06:39] <Cork> also scoped is depricated and no browser implements it
[04:06:44] <jquery743> that's why i'm asking in the first place
[04:06:49] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle showing what you're trying to accomplish.
[04:14:28] <jquery743> i did, yet with pseudocode on js side https://jsfiddle.net/aolko/o40y7fvq/5/
[04:14:53] <jquery743> if you won't get it by now then i don't know how to explain that
[04:15:12] <robertmaxrees> that is the first time you've sent that.
[04:15:28] <jquery743> regardless, is it clear?
[04:15:32] <robertmaxrees> and "tag" is undefined there.
[04:15:50] <robertmaxrees> where's the jquery??
[04:15:50] <jquery743> it is, because it's pseudocode
[04:15:58] <robertmaxrees> OK
[04:16:02] <robertmaxrees> what does "register" mean?
[04:16:10] <robertmaxrees> if it's "pseudocode"?
[04:16:11] <jquery743> jquery should be in the library itself, tag is a library's method
[04:16:34] <robertmaxrees> tag is not a jquery method.
[04:17:05] <jquery743> register means "mount the contents of the template to the target tag"
[04:17:17] <robertmaxrees> jquery is a DOM abstraction library
[04:17:34] <robertmaxrees> it's not a framework.
[04:17:50] <robertmaxrees> maybe you're in the wrong place?
[04:17:56] <jquery743> no i'm not
[04:18:06] <robertmaxrees> none of your code involves jquery
[04:18:11] <robertmaxrees> so what gives?
[04:18:26] <jquery743> what if it's a jquery plugin
[04:18:31] <robertmaxrees> what plugin?
[04:18:36] <jquery743> brand new
[04:18:42] <robertmaxrees> which?
[04:18:44] <robertmaxrees> we can
[04:18:49] <robertmaxrees> *can't read minds.
[04:19:04] <jquery743> okay tell me what __did__ you get
[04:19:12] <robertmaxrees> wut
[04:19:24] <robertmaxrees> nothing you've shared has made any sense.
[04:19:33] <robertmaxrees> nothing you've shared uses jquery
[04:19:37] <robertmaxrees> so what gives?
[04:20:17] <undefined_bob> I'm sorry but I also don't really get/understand what you're trying to solve :/
[04:20:25] <robertmaxrees> **
[04:20:29] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[04:20:52] <jquery743> riddle me this, how do i even write that plugin, not knowing how to in the first place? That is why i did a pseudocode, for you to get the gist.
[04:21:04] <robertmaxrees> write WHAT "plugin"????
[04:21:11] <jquery743> all that's left for you is to explain how to write such a plugin
[04:21:18] <robertmaxrees> we can
[04:21:21] <jquery743> look at the damn fiddle
[04:21:30] <Cork> "adding an element but not appending" is a really weird statement and you haven't explained what you mean yet
[04:21:30] <robertmaxrees> *we can't explain what we don't understand/.
[04:21:39] <robertmaxrees> you're being vague and awkward.
[04:22:03] <jquery743> okay, look at the x-tag's api if you don't get the idea from pseudocode
[04:22:09] <robertmaxrees> no
[04:22:54] <robertmaxrees> use jquery or don't.  but don't assume we'll provide support for some random other library :)
[04:23:26] <Cork> jquery743: are you asking how to add content to template without having it parsed as elements?
[04:23:34] <Cork> or what is the actual question?
[04:23:50] <jquery743> add template contest to cutom tag with shadow dom
[04:23:53] <jquery743> custom
[04:24:14] <robertmaxrees> shadow dom isn't something jquery does.
[04:24:26] <jquery743> maybe there's a plugin
[04:24:27] <robertmaxrees> check out https://learn.jquery.com/
[04:24:56] <robertmaxrees> gotta lot to learn.
[04:26:27] <jquery743> well, that requires a patch https://jsfiddle.net/Jan_Miksovsky/y9hSm/
[04:26:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[04:27:10] <robertmaxrees> one more time: what are you trying to do?
[04:27:42] <jquery743> Cork, please relay whatever i'm trying to explain to @robertmaxrees, he doesn't get it
[04:27:51] <Cork> ...
[04:28:01] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[04:28:04] <jquery743> you get it
[04:28:06] <robertmaxrees> nobody "gets it"
[04:28:09] <Cork> jquery743: you haven't explained what you want to do, how could anyone get it..
[04:28:14] <robertmaxrees> one more time.
[04:28:19] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[04:28:24] <jquery743> i provided refernces and a fiddle
[04:28:32] <robertmaxrees> none of those explain it.
[04:28:35] <robertmaxrees> sorry bud.
[04:29:04] <robertmaxrees> woops - typo
[04:29:07] <Cork> :)
[04:29:13] <Cork> look in the goo
[04:29:20] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[04:29:28] <robertmaxrees> STARE INTO THE GOO
[04:29:52] <undefined_bob> lol
[04:29:56] <Cork> that reminded me so hard about a user i fought with many years ago here, he basically wanted a myWebpage(); plugin
[04:30:05] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[04:30:29] <robertmaxrees> Cork next time PM me "NEXT" and i'll just boot lmaop
[04:30:30] <Cork> and i was like, not you won't find a plugin that does your webpage exactly like you want it
[04:31:17] <Cork> that was like 2014 or so, so not a big problem
[04:31:28] * robertmaxrees gestures to today
[04:31:34] <Cork> ah
[04:32:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[04:32:26] <Cork> i usually just drop them like a wet blanket if they refuse to ask an actional question
[04:33:27] <Cork> but this one was weird cause he switched question area every time he went to explain more what he wanted to do
[04:34:01] <Cork> started with template, how to plugin, then shadow dom and then over to patching .html()
[04:34:35] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[04:54:42] <robertmaxrees> ahahaaha watching them in ##javascript, they're using riotjs
[04:56:13] <Cork> heh that conversation looks very familiar, not sure where that could have been...
[04:56:29] * robertmaxrees whistles
[05:07:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
