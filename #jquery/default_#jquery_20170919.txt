[00:44:14] <GoSox> How would I select element of class "myclass" only inside of form $(this) ?
[00:44:34] <GoSox> do i have to do a search/find?
[00:44:40] <GoSox> or is htere a more direct way
[01:04:03] <GoSox> meh i just used find()
[01:12:26] <MiWebTechX> Here is a tutorial on simple image cropping using jquery, ajax, and php. Enjoy! http://corexsystems.net/2017/09/19/317/      Work in progress!
[01:38:50] <GoSox> Is there something like .find( ) but for searching UP a tree instead of down?
[01:39:07] <GoSox> like i want to search parnets till I find a 'hit'
[01:45:55] <MaxLeiter> https://api.jquery.com/parents/
[01:46:01] <MaxLeiter> just iterate over
[02:18:43] <undefined_bob> morning
[02:19:26] <GoSox> GAH this is the worst day ever
[02:19:37] <Cork> <_<'
[02:19:43] <undefined_bob> why?
[02:22:31] <undefined_bob> Cork: first I want to thank you for all your help and especially for your patient with me
[02:22:51] <Cork> np
[07:07:44] <anicow> hey guys im trying to make an iframe refresh at a 10 second interval
[07:11:19] <anicow> can anyone spot the error? setInterval(function() { $('#iframe')[0].contentWindow.location.reload(true);,10000 )};
[07:12:08] <Cork> the parentheses and brackets is mixed up
[07:12:32] <anicow> could you help me?
[07:12:49] <undefined_bob> anicow:  maybe this can help you too :) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5146805/an-iframe-i-need-to-refresh-every-30-seconds-but-not-the-whole-page
[07:12:49] <Cork> setInterval(function() { $('#iframe')[0].contentWindow.location.reload(true); }, 10000);
[07:13:09] <Cork> or just set a meta tag in the page you load in the iframe
[07:13:32] <anicow> i didnt know you can set a meta refresh for only an iframe
[07:13:39] <anicow> the page i am trying to refresh is just a .txt file
[07:14:01] <Cork> well you can either set it in the http header
[07:14:16] <Cork> or you could wrap the text content in a <html><head></head><body>
[07:14:32] <anicow> i with meta i can name an element by ID like in javascript?
[07:14:50] <Cork> you set it in the page you load in the iframe not the parent document
[07:14:56] <anicow> ah ok
[07:15:16] <anicow> tthank you
[07:16:26] <Cork> anicow: for the .txt you can do http://www.otsukare.info/2015/03/26/refresh-http-header
[07:16:46] <Cork> and then you wouldn't need js at all for it t work
[07:17:53] <anicow> yes i am aware of a meta tag in the head i would normally just do that
[07:18:03] <anicow> but the txt file is being dynamically created by another program.
[07:18:17] <Cork> anicow: you skipped the first section of the link
[07:18:19] <anicow> and i wouldnt be able to close the tags properly
[07:18:36] <Cork> i wasn't primarily talking about the <meta> tag
[07:18:47] <anicow> ok im looking again
[07:25:55] <anicow> id ont follow so ill just try jquery
[07:26:07] <anicow> trying to learn it is way overdue for me anyway
[07:26:51] <Cork> anicow: just set the web server you have to set a reload header on the text file and your done
[07:27:01] <Cork> that was the point
[07:27:49] <anicow> oh i see
[07:28:11] <Cork> are you really?
[07:28:18] <Cork> you've said that three times now >_>
[07:28:33] <anicow> well, i dont really understand but im saying it do for the sake of advancing the conversation
[07:28:42] <Cork> ...
[07:28:50] <Woet> theres nothing to advance
[07:28:53] <Woet> you have your answer
[07:28:53] <Cork> so just wasting my time you mean
[07:28:54] <Woet> go implement it
[07:29:15] <anicow> i mean, it just seems more difficult than fixing the error in the one line of jquery
[07:29:31] <anicow> which is what im still trying to do
[07:29:34] <Cork> more diffecult to add one line of configuration in the server?
[07:29:41] <Cork> @_@'
[07:31:11] <anicow> so that would work if the txt file is on a different web server?
[07:31:18] <Cork> ...
[07:31:23] <Cork> seriously?
[07:31:26] <anicow> nevermind
[07:42:07] <anicow> ok i got it sorted another way
[07:42:26] <anicow> thanks for insulting my intellegence and making me feel extremely uncomfortable and stupid
[07:43:28] <Cork> linking to a page explaining about it and still not getting even close to what it was about after reading it twice...
[07:43:43] <Cork> how could one insult the intellegence of that person
[08:11:38] <hellyeah> any plugin suggestion when you click image it will show in the middle of scrween in bigger scale?
[08:19:11] <Cork> hellyeah: have a check at lightbox
[08:20:15] <hellyeah> looking at it now
[08:30:51] <hellyeah> is there any short way to execute that? https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/7bMmE/42/
[08:30:54] <cos_> hey guys can someone tell me how to make a list of elements like $('.className') ... but dynamically
[08:31:32] <hellyeah> .addClass
[08:31:57] <hellyeah> first create multiple elements then loop it and add that class to each element.
[08:32:01] <MikeD_> cos_: you mean a collection like you'd normally get when you use .find() or such?
[08:32:44] <MikeD_> var stuff = $();   stuff.add( $("#foo") ); stuff.add( $(".bar") ); etc.
[08:33:22] <hellyeah> i think he/she wants same class for multiple elements
[08:33:40] <cos_> yeah basically what am trying to do is get a portion of elements within an another object array
[08:34:17] <MikeD_> it might help if you made a jsfiddle example
[08:34:51] <cos_> so say there is ten elements in a object array ... I wanna stick 4 to 8 in an object array 0 to 3
[08:35:12] <MikeD_> .slice()?
[08:35:41] <hellyeah> i was gonna say that
[08:35:48] <hellyeah> you can have multiple array with that
[08:39:08] <hellyeah> anyone use lightbox here
[08:42:38] <cos_> hey MikeD_ https://jsfiddle.net/oq57fwsj/
[08:43:33] <cos_> from the console ... the first array has 1: 2: 3: and the object array I created just has the elements
[08:49:33] <Cork> cos_: {} != array
[08:49:53] <Cork> also don't forget to define your variables (var)
[08:55:56] <MikeD_> you might also want to look at this: http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[08:56:57] <MikeD_> also, how do you know you want 4 through 8 ?
[09:00:49] <cos_> thanks Cork I will look into it!
[09:01:27] <cos_> MikeE_ its just an example ... if I can get 4 through 8 I can get any range ;)
[09:02:26] <hellyeah> you can give two parameter in function
[09:06:58] <Cork> cos_: also you might want to check slice
[09:07:18] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[09:07:40] <Cork> it's a much more efficient way to get a range if that is what you want
[09:27:45] <hellyeah> any idea why it didnt work https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/z45psby6/2/
[09:31:30] <Cork> hellyeah: lightbox != lightBox
[09:33:53] <Cork> hellyeah: also you don't need to call lightbox it extends the html directly
[09:35:36] <Cork> hellyeah: https://jsfiddle.net/z45psby6/3/
[10:41:13] <cos_> thanks Cork, MikeD_ got it!
[11:53:50] * taplar sings the walk 500 miles song
[11:55:35] <codecutter> how do i get the last object? https://pastebin.com/XuUByTEh e.g. "2017-05-24"
[11:55:46] * poboy would walk 500 more
[11:56:19] * taplar slow claps for poboy
[11:56:20] <taplar> well done
[11:57:01] <taplar> codecutter: try doing Object.keys() on that object and get the last key
[11:57:29] <codecutter> what if the key is random (its always doing to be current day)
[11:57:47] <taplar> Object.keys() will give you an array of the keys on the object
[11:58:27] <taplar> if the key you want is always the current day, you could compute that based off of Date() or moment.js to derive they desired key
[12:13:16] <codecutter> how do i store a single key/value pair?
[12:13:31] <taplar> ?
[12:14:04] <codecutter> is it always like this var foo = {'key':value}
[12:14:24] <taplar> sure
[12:14:31] <codecutter> even for single key/val apir?
[12:14:35] <codecutter> pair*
[12:14:45] <taplar> if you are going to have it in an object, yep
[12:15:09] <taplar> otherwise you could just do var key = value
[12:15:51] <grapheti> don't *let* him fool you
[12:16:01] <grapheti> jkjk
[12:16:32] <taplar> i mean if you know it's going to be just one thing, why make it an object
[12:17:02] <taplar> unless it could turn into multiple and you are trying to future proof a bit
[12:27:43] <guideX> any idea why this doesn't work on dynamic elements https://pastebin.com/raw/kAiJG0hX
[12:27:50] <guideX> pulling my hair out etc
[12:28:18] <guideX> I do a length, and I am finding the object, but the overlay and image doesn't display etc
[12:28:57] <guideX> when the element is created with appendTo the overlay script doesn't work etc
[12:29:19] <robertmaxrees> guideX which part?
[12:30:14] <guideX> the whole thing doesn't display etc
[12:30:31] <guideX> it's like the script isn't able to show it on the dynamic elements etc
[12:30:36] <robertmaxrees> well
[12:30:50] <guideX> even if I manually put the "loading-overlay" there in chrome, it still doesn't show
[12:30:57] <guideX> only on the dynamic ones etc
[12:31:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah,t he ones that aren't there on pageload?
[12:31:16] <guideX> yes exactly
[12:31:25] <robertmaxrees> that's because this fires only on document ready.
[12:31:39] <guideX> oh hrm
[12:31:46] <robertmaxrees> look at the bottom.
[12:31:48] <robertmaxrees> see the $('[data-loading-overlay]').loadingOverlay(); ?
[12:31:58] <guideX> ohhhh
[12:32:02] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:32:08] <robertmaxrees> can't init on things that don't yet exist.
[12:32:08] <guideX> ok, so I need to refresh the objects loading etc
[12:32:17] <robertmaxrees> easy enough fix.  just re-run $('[data-loading-overlay]').loadingOverlay(); after your stuff exists.
[12:32:26] <robertmaxrees> or target the particular elements you care about.
[12:32:26] <taplar> personally i'd take the auto init out
[12:32:30] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:32:37] <robertmaxrees> is this a plugin or did you write this?
[12:32:43] <guideX> I did not write this plugin no
[12:32:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i wouldn't modify it in that case.
[12:33:01] <guideX> but yeah I'll try that, thanks a lot
[12:33:44] <guideX> yeah that works, cool thanks
[12:39:46] <taplar> http://www.grumpicon.com/ <-- just found this, pretty funny.  then i sat there long enough and noticed the unicorn blinks
[12:42:07] <robertmaxrees> oooh./
[12:42:08] <robertmaxrees> neat
[12:43:33] <grapheti> lol
[12:55:04] <codecutter> how do get the prev date? this gives the current: moment(Date.now()).format('YYYY-MM-DD');
[12:55:18] <codecutter> this does not work moment(Date.now()-1).format('YYYY-MM-DD');
[12:55:28] <taplar> Date.now() is a long
[12:55:38] <taplar> milliseconds
[12:55:59] <codecutter> yea, i know but moment.js seems to format it correctly
[12:56:05] <codecutter> do you have a better way?
[12:56:21] <codecutter> other than Date.now()?
[12:56:25] <taplar> http://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/subtract/
[13:00:56] <codecutter> this is wrong - console.log(currentDate.moment().subtract(1, 'days'));
[13:01:08] <codecutter> var currentDate = moment(Date.now()).format('YYYY-MM-DD');
[13:01:22] <taplar> you shouldn't have to do moment(Date.now())
[13:01:24] <taplar> it should do that by default
[13:01:43] <codecutter> can i see how you do it?
[13:02:04] <taplar> try just: console.log(moment().subtract(1, 'days'));
[13:02:07] <taplar> like the docs
[13:03:27] <codecutter> console.log(moment().subtract(1, 'days')); seems deprecated
[13:04:32] <robertmaxrees> "seems"?
[13:05:53] <codecutter> bruh!
[13:06:14] <codecutter> i'm getting a warning stating exactly that
[13:06:25] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/dxofLdx6/
[13:06:42] <robertmaxrees> https://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/subtract/
[13:06:50] <robertmaxrees> "It has been deprecated in favor of moment#subtract(Number, String)."
[13:07:01] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/dxofLdx6/1/
[13:07:20] <codecutter> console.log(moment().subtract(1, 'days'));
[13:07:48] <codecutter> subtract has a line going across, indicating deprecation
[13:07:55] <taplar> works in the fiddle, i don't see warnings
[13:08:42] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:08:47] <robertmaxrees> just need to flip the args
[13:10:44] <codecutter> i have version": "2.18.1"
[13:11:12] <taplar> that fiddles has the latest from the repo
[13:11:44] <codecutter> same version (i think)
[13:12:11] <codecutter> moment.subtract is not a function
[13:12:21] <taplar> my fiddle disagrees with you
[13:12:31] <taplar> moment().subtract
[13:12:59] <codecutter> nvm
[13:13:03] <taplar> lol
[13:13:28] <codecutter> console.log(moment().subtract(1, 'days'));
[13:13:34] <codecutter> console.log(moment.subtract(1, 'days'));
[13:13:42] <codecutter> both give me the same message
[13:13:52] <taplar> what does that fiddle do for you?
[13:13:52] <robertmaxrees> what version of moment are you using?
[13:13:53] <codecutter> subtract not a function
[13:14:09] <codecutter> i have version": "2.18.1"
[13:14:14] <taplar> not what i asked
[13:14:21] <taplar> oh, nvm
[13:14:39] <codecutter> tapler: well, if you say it works then i'll take your word for it
[13:14:48] <codecutter> but my script is giving me that warning
[13:14:50] <taplar> i'm not saying that.  i provided an example
[13:14:54] <taplar> which works
[13:15:02] <taplar> does the fiddle work for you?
[13:15:26] <codecutter> yes
[13:15:27] <codecutter> lol
[13:15:41] <codecutter> happy?
[13:15:44] <taplar> so something you are doing is different.  that's what you gotta figure out
[13:16:29] <taplar> it's not a matter of being happy.  you keep saying things dont work, but i provided an example
[13:16:41] <taplar> so there is a discrepency some where that has to be found
[13:17:36] <codecutter> no warning on line 7 (but does not work) https://pastebin.com/wNdS7SGS
[13:18:12] <taplar> right
[13:18:17] <taplar> cause moment is a method
[13:18:21] <taplar> moment()
[13:18:41] <taplar> which will return an object that has the subtract method on it
[13:18:50] <taplar> but moment, itself, does not have the subtract method on it, most likely
[13:19:07] <taplar> just like jQuery has some methods you can do, like $.ajax
[13:19:20] <taplar> and others you cant, like $.children
[13:19:30] <taplar> you have to $(findSomething).children
[13:19:39] <codecutter> console.log(moment.moment().subtract(1, 'days'))
[13:19:44] <codecutter> does not work either
[13:19:52] <taplar> -_-
[13:19:53] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[13:19:56] <taplar> of course not
[13:20:17] <taplar> where did you see that usage in their docs?
[13:20:41] <codecutter> i see what u mean
[13:21:01] <codecutter> this gives me a warning moment().subtract(1, currentDate);
[13:21:08] <codecutter> strange
[13:21:09] <taplar> what is 'currentDate' ?
[13:21:55] <taplar> the second parameter is expected to be the type of time to operate upon
[13:22:00] <taplar> days/minutes/seconds/etc
[13:22:15] <codecutter> see here https://pastebin.com/wNdS7SGS
[13:22:16] <taplar> i'm subtracting 1, 'days'
[13:22:29] <taplar> or you could tell me
[13:22:40] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[13:22:58] <robertmaxrees> codecutter the arguments are a number and then a unit.  not a datetime.
[13:23:17] <taplar> as the docs state
[13:25:12] <codecutter> line 2 prints fine https://pastebin.com/9DwFyiuV
[13:25:50] <robertmaxrees> do you get any console errors?
[13:26:30] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/dxofLdx6/2/  no warnings or errors
[13:27:49] <codecutter> here is what that prints Moment {_isAMomentObject: true, _isUTC: false, _pf: {…}, _locale: Locale, _d: Mon Sep 18 2017 18:27:20 GMT+0100 (BST), …}
[13:28:04] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:28:05] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:28:11] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:28:36] <robertmaxrees> you're getting the moment object.
[13:28:42] <robertmaxrees> still need to .format it.
[13:29:34] <codecutter> got it
[14:30:42] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/6bq97r3r/  not what i wanted it to do, but kinda funny

[16:45:13] <taplar> poboy: looks like it is taking the results and putting it in the session_vars variable
[16:45:47] <taplar> you could probably use $.extend there instead of that each
[16:48:43] <poboy> taplar I read the docs but don't quite understand how .extend is different than .each in this case
[16:49:16] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/zmpdxvvj/
[16:49:23] <taplar> your each is essentially doing what the extend already does
[16:49:29] <taplar> you're reinventing the wheel
[16:51:57] <poboy> thanks.  This is existing code and I have to add some stuff and was trying to figure out what's going on here first
[17:02:31] <taplar> https://codepen.io/suez/pen/oXLroX   wow
[17:09:22] <grapheti> someone feed that man's cat!
[17:15:59] <is_null> hi all, why is it that $('form.form-invalid').serialize() returns "" when something like $('form.form-invalid :input').get(4).value returns a value like "oeau" ?
[17:16:39] <duch_kazatel> can you show an example of the markup in a fiddle?
[17:17:29] <taplar> they have to have names
[17:18:05] <taplar> without a name on the input i'm 99.999% sure they will not be serialized
[17:18:30] <is_null> thanks, yeah they do $($('form.form-invalid :input').get(4)).attr('name') = "name"
[17:19:36] <taplar> o_o
[17:20:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah, markup would be nice.
[17:21:29] <is_null> oh go, i disabled the fields before serializing
[17:21:41] <taplar> :)
[17:21:44] <is_null> figured by debugging serialize, sorry for the noise ^^
[17:21:57] <taplar> i want to make one small point
[17:22:18] <taplar> $('form.form-invalid :input').get(4).name or $('form.form-invalid :input').eq(4).attr('name')
[17:22:59] <is_null> thank you for clarifying this for me <3 <3 <3
[17:42:50] <grapheti> is_null is blowing you kisses
[17:43:16] <taplar> they can't.  they are undefined
[17:43:35] <taplar> or something
[17:45:37] <grapheti> typeof NaN
[17:45:43] <grapheti> still wish it was a number
[17:46:34] <grapheti> wait, I mean I'm glad it's a number :D
[17:55:13] <_mkw> Hello! Does anyone know why Safari does not refocus the tab when a confirm() dialog is called? It shows up, but does not refocus the tab
[17:55:58] <robertmaxrees> probably because safari doesn't want to interrupt the user from whatever they're doing.
[18:38:11] <guideX> when using this $("#ul li").slideUp('slow', function () {   How do I wait for all of the slideUp's to finish, then call a function?
[18:38:34] <guideX> I am calling a function now but, it calls it n number of times depending on how many elements etc
[18:39:50] <guideX> maybe I need to count how many elements there are, then wait for slideUp to be executed n number of times?
[18:40:47] <poboy> do you have a jsfiddle?
[18:42:12] <guideX> I don't have a jsfiddle sorry
[19:02:28] <robertmaxrees> guideX so you have multiple slides and you want to do something when all are complete?
[19:03:03] <robertmaxrees> or something to happen after each one finishes?
[19:06:11] <robertmaxrees> guideX https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gtcymch0/
[19:06:37] <robertmaxrees> runs only once.
[19:10:37] <guideX> oh nice ok, I ended up doing this maybe I should revise https://pastebin.com/raw/Nf219uWu yours looks better, i'll check thanks
[19:14:19] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah, don't count manually.
[19:43:09] <hlve> Hi. Anyone able to help me clean this code up a bit? The top portion of the code feels super redundant, what can I do about it?
[19:43:10] <hlve> https://jsfiddle.net/oz80fsdj/
[19:44:12] <robertmaxrees> well.
[19:44:29] <robertmaxrees> why are you putting order information ina  class and not as a data ttribute in the first place?
[19:44:49] <hlve> ignore the order information in the classname. that was just for debugging
[19:44:58] <robertmaxrees> so then what part am I looking at?
[19:45:00] <hlve> the code itself orders based off of the data attribute
[19:45:15] <robertmaxrees> so starting at what line should I be looking?
[19:45:27] <robertmaxrees> 'cauise you said "the top portion" but now you're telling me to ignore that.
[19:45:28] <hlve> $('.div1').data('order',2);
[19:45:31] <hlve> That bit
[19:45:33] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[19:45:42] <robertmaxrees> soooo why isn't that just on the elements to begin with?
[19:45:45] <robertmaxrees> why add that via js?
[19:46:41] <hlve> Let me redo this markup real quick to better show what I'm doing
[19:47:21] <poboy> ok, so my fiddle's not working but it works in my project.  My question is how to rewrite this JS into jquery. https://jsfiddle.net/7064m4f2/
[19:47:55] <robertmaxrees> poboy first off, onclick="myFunction()"
[19:48:01] <robertmaxrees> why not use a jquery event listener?
[19:48:05] <hlve> https://jsfiddle.net/oz80fsdj/1/ ^
[19:48:23] <robertmaxrees> hlve yeah, same question.  why add the data after the fact?
[19:48:29] <robertmaxrees> why not in the markup itself?
[19:48:32] <poboy> guess I'm just used to onlick.  at work that's "what we do"
[19:48:44] <hlve> there are default order attrs in the code. this is allowing easy editing for the client.
[19:48:51] <hlve> basically allowing them to rearrange divs
[19:48:57] <poboy> but now I'm just messing around on a personal project and trying to learn better practices.  :)
[19:49:14] <robertmaxrees> poboy i'd start by removing that onlick and use jquery's on.
[19:50:05] <robertmaxrees> hlve so would you have some kind of state object for that fruit -> index relationship?
[19:50:47] <poboy> https://jsfiddle.net/7064m4f2/1/
[19:51:07] <hlve> in a sense, having a list of the div with fruit names at the top of my JS, with the ability to change around number positions at ease
[19:51:24] <robertmaxrees> poboy remove the onclick.
[19:53:19] <poboy> the function or what?
[19:53:33] <robertmaxrees>   onclick="myFunction()"
[19:53:35] <robertmaxrees> remove that.
[19:53:37] <robertmaxrees> you don't want it.
[19:53:55] <robertmaxrees> hlve https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/oz80fsdj/2/
[19:53:57] <poboy> oh, sorry.
[19:54:11] <hlve> exactly what i was looking for. Thanks.
[19:54:17] <poboy> https://jsfiddle.net/7064m4f2/3/  what about the 2nd function?
[19:54:41] * hlve gives mucho hugs to robertmaxrees 
[19:54:55] <robertmaxrees> poboy i'm assuming you're just trying to close all .dropdown-content elements?
[19:55:21] <poboy> yeah, just a typical hamburger dropdown menu
[19:55:46] <poboy> it's functioning as intended now, just trying to rewrite the js into jquery
[19:59:33] <robertmaxrees> poboy one sec.
[20:01:36] <robertmaxrees> poboy https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7064m4f2/6/
[20:01:38] <robertmaxrees> something like tyhis.,
[20:02:34] <robertmaxrees> poboy pretty simple ideas.
[20:06:52] <poboy> thanks.  ok, so stopPropagation  stops the event from bubbling up
[20:07:42] <poboy> is that something that would become a problem if stopPropagation wasn't there?
[20:13:08] <robertmaxrees> it would activate the parent listener as well.
