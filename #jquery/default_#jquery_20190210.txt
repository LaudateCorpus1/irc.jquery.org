[06:56:27] <hans_> $(n).click(); doesn't work, $(n).trigger("click"); doesn't work, var event = new MouseEvent('click', {view: window,bubbles: true,cancelable: true});$(n)[0].dispatchEvent(event);  *does* work, it's a <a href="blabla" /> element, any idea why?
[06:57:02] <hans_> (by "doesn't work" i mean, apparently nothing happens, and the browser certainly doesn't react the same way as if i had clicked it manually)
[06:57:50] <hans_> running jQuery 3.3.1
[07:00:01] <hans_> $(n).length is 1
[07:03:11] <hans_> i have confirmed that it runs once the document is ready, and adding it inside $().ready(function(){$(n).trigger("click");});  makes no difference
[07:12:30] <hans_> ... and $(n)[0].click(); works too
[07:12:33] <hans_> :|
[07:16:58] <hans_> i suppose i can do this as a shitty workaround: jQuery.fn.extend({myClick:function(){return this.each(function(){var event = new MouseEvent('click', {view: window,bubbles: true,cancelable: true});this.dispatchEvent(event);});}});
[07:38:06] <Cork> hans_: you can't fake click a link if that is what you're asking
[07:38:26] <Cork> you can trigger event handlers bound on the a tag, but not get the browser to follow the link
[07:39:02] <Cork> if triggering the event handler is the problem, make a jsfiddle showing the problem
[07:39:07] <hans_> Cork, incorrect, because this does just that: var event = new MouseEvent('click', {view: window,bubbles: true,cancelable: true}); $("a")[0].dispatchEvent(event);
[07:39:29] <Cork> hans_: if you can get that to work, file a but to the browser vendor cause they have a security hole
[07:39:36] <Cork> js isn
[07:39:40] <hans_> ...
[07:39:54] <Cork> * js isn't allowed to trigger link navigation in any secure browser
[07:40:11] <Cork> cause it would work around browser security
[07:40:36] <Cork> the only way js is a allowed to change the url is through window.location
[07:41:04] <Cork> (and this is handled by the secure: true value in the event object)
[07:42:13] <Cork> and anyway, if you got the workaround to work it is not cross browser for the said reason
[07:46:08] <hans_> Cork, this works fine for me on both Google and Firefox: http://ratma.net/foo.html
[07:46:19] <hans_> ... but couldn't get it to work on jsfiddle, dunno why
[07:46:53] <hans_> (warning, the redirect happens very fast, try view-source or curl)
[07:47:03] <Cork> i very much doubt that it would work in firefox at least
[07:47:16] <hans_> got firefox nearby? try it
[07:47:18] <Cork> there code it built to not follow links if the event isn't a secure event
[07:47:26] <Cork> no i don't
[07:47:49] <hans_> well i am not using the main firefox release, i am using the ESR release, but it is fully up to date: 60.5.0esr (64-bit)
[07:48:16] <hans_> Cork, yeah because i have $10,000 + firefox 0-day to burn on infecting random people on freenode. sounds plausible
[07:48:54] <Cork> hans_: faking clicking on ads as soon as the user visits the site, ya that would be an exploit
[07:49:20] <Cork> that is actually exactly why secure was added
[07:49:38] <hans_> i'm not fake-clicking on ads, i'm trying to click on this "go to login screen" in a game, https://i.imgur.com/SMjtr35.png
[07:51:00] <hans_> anyway, "it works on firefox and chrome" is portable enough for me
[07:55:10] <hans_> anyway, in firefox and chrome, this works in a standalone html file, but it doesn't work on jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/oyd5g6u1/
[07:57:16] <hans_> Cork, probably off-topic for #jquery, but how is "allowing javascript to click on <a> elements" a security issue?
[07:57:52] <hans_> i can see it being "annoying" or unwanted for advertisers combating people who are faking clicks, but i don't see it as a security issue
[08:01:03] <Cork> hans_: it would mean scripts could cause click events on elements used for security context
[08:01:15] <Cork> navigation is considered one of those
[08:01:19] <Cork> popup blocking is another
[08:01:30] <Cork> there are more that i don't have in my head right now
[08:01:57] <Cork> you should be able to find it if you look around in the event standard
[08:12:05] <hans_> .. in any case, the workaround works, both in firefox and chrome.
[10:56:23] <BlackBishop> hi awesome peeps.
[10:56:41] <BlackBishop> Any recommendations for a inplace simple <div> editor ?
[14:00:05] <Rojola> hi
[14:01:02] <Rojola> I'm just playing around with this:
[14:01:03] <Rojola> https://jqueryui.com/resizable/
[14:01:25] <Rojola> I am planning on using this as a sidebar.
[14:01:43] <Rojola> The problem is: When the sidebar gets resized,  the content will be overlapped.
[14:02:05] <Rojola> How can I find out the width of the sidebar, so that I can adjust the margin of the content at the right side?
[14:04:19] <bestdesign1> good question
[14:08:02] <Rojola> I think I've found a solution
[14:08:03] <Rojola> https://stackoverflow.com/a/26440831
[14:14:31] <bestdesign1> Rojola:
[14:14:34] <bestdesign1> may i ask something?
[14:16:55] <Rojola> sure - but I don't know if I can help
[16:40:48] <sine0> how can jquery/js obtain data from php
[16:46:20] <robertparkerx> AJAX?
[16:58:33] <sine0> yea i guess that is the only option
