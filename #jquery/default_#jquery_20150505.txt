[00:35:05] <dziegler> Hi guys, i have a problem with my jquery ajax response, if i get an ordered list as json from my server, javascript reorder the list by the id of the json: https://gist.github.com/nook24/068ca472b152c2e09ca7
[00:35:10] <dziegler> Can i avoud this?
[00:35:16] <dziegler> *avoid
[00:54:00] <Cork> dziegler: objects doesn't have a guaranteed order
[00:54:11] <Cork> if they have to be in a specific order you need to use an array of objects instead
[00:54:32] <Cork> that said, why do you care?
[00:55:30] <dziegler> Cork: because get the user a unsortet list is ugly like hell
[00:55:51] <Cork> dziegler: then sort sort them by the value
[00:56:14] <Cork> meaning get the keys then sort it by obj[key]
[00:56:22] <Cork> opps
[00:56:29] <Cork> obj.hosts[key]
[00:57:03] <Cork> dziegler: but ya, if you want to keep a specific sort order you need to use an array
[00:57:24] <Cork> ex. { hosts: [{id:"", host:""},{id:"", host:""},{id:"", host:""}] }
[00:58:04] <dziegler> Cork: so you mean i need to parse the json response from php to a array and sort this again with javasript? I guess a array with 10k element let my browser crash
[00:58:28] <Cork> dziegler: i mean if you have something that isn't sorted and you want it sorrted
[00:58:30] <Cork> *sorted
[00:58:33] <Cork> you have to sort it
[00:58:42] <Cork> or you have to send it sorted from the server
[00:59:10] <dziegler> its sorted, by JS give a shit of my sort because its json ^^
[00:59:30] <Cork> dziegler: no, objects don't have a sorted order
[01:00:08] <Cork> the order of the keys is undefined, you get it in the order the implementation walked over the keys
[01:00:17] <Cork> arrays are sorted, objects aren't
[01:00:45] <dziegler> how can i convert my json to an array using javascript?
[01:00:47] <Cork> this is true for js AND json
[01:01:02] <Cork> dziegler: it isn't json vs not json
[01:01:07] <Cork> its {} vs []
[01:01:25] <Cork> dziegler: you have the json parsed, and you get an object as you use an object
[01:01:40] <Cork> and the order the object holds the keys isn't defined to be a specific order
[01:01:43] <Cork> so you can't depend on that
[01:02:36] <Cork> dziegler: so you have two options: 1. use an array that has an order
[01:02:47] <Cork> or 2. sort the result in the order you want it
[01:03:00] <dziegler> I understood but how can i now convert my object to an array to sort it again using javascript? i dont want to use for but i bet there is no other solution in js...
[01:03:17] <Cork> dziegler: i gave you that before
[01:04:50] <dziegler> yes, the obj.hosts[key] is something that only will work in a for(var key in obj) right? so ther is no cast (array)object in javascript?^^
[01:06:16] <Cork> js> var obj = {"hosts": {"58": "Hostname1","37": "Hostname2","35": "Hostname3"}}; print(Object.keys(obj.hosts).sort(function(a,b) { return (obj.hosts[a] < obj.hosts[b] ? -1 : (obj.hosts[a] > obj.hosts[b] ? 1 : 0));}))
[01:06:27] <Cork> <_<
[01:06:29] <b-ot> Cork: 58,37,35
[01:06:37] <Cork> b-ot: you're slow
[01:07:05] <Cork> dziegler: array has a sort function
[01:07:18] <Uhkis> <b-ot> no, your code is
[01:07:30] <Cork> actually, no it isn't :P
[01:07:52] <Cork> but ya, fix the api and this becomes unneeded
[01:08:07] <dziegler> Cork: many thanks for that, just a little idea to avoid double sorting
[01:08:44] <Cork> dziegler: be extremely careful with key in obj
[01:08:54] <Cork> as it can grab more properties then you expect
[01:09:47] <Cork> js> var o = {}; Object.prototype.opps = 'yes'; var res = []; for(var k in o) { res.push(k) }; print(JSON.stringify(res))
[01:09:50] <b-ot> Cork: ["opps"]
[01:10:09] <Cork> i've fixed too many libs that do that mistake...
[01:10:33] <sentiment> hello
[01:10:48] <Cork> js> var o = {}; Object.prototype.opps = 'yes'; var res = []; for(var k in o) { if(o.hasOwnProperty(k)) { res.push(k) } }; print(JSON.stringify(res))
[01:10:50] <b-ot> Cork: []
[01:10:57] <dimi1947> I have 2 divs and each of them has two p tags...I want to target the second ones...not the firsts ...I tried some filtering operation but I would need some help https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/b8bzq2xb/
[01:10:59] <Cork> js> var o = { a: 1 }; Object.prototype.opps = 'yes'; var res = []; for(var k in o) { if(o.hasOwnProperty(k)) { res.push(k) } }; print(JSON.stringify(res))
[01:11:01] <sentiment> can somebody please explain the following behavior to me ?
[01:11:09] <dziegler> If i add a new extension to my php code (for example .array) how does my result looke like that jquery $.ajax is able to handle this?
[01:11:19] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[01:11:23] <Cork> <_<
[01:11:27] <dimi1947> the p tags I want to target has class=fill_...
[01:11:30] <Cork> stupid bot...
[01:11:31] <sentiment> $( selectedRoot ).parent().parent().find("li").not("[level='1'][level='2']") correctly excludes those nodes with either of those attributes BUT...
[01:11:56] <sentiment> selectedRoot.parent().parent().not("[level='1'][level='2']") does not , I have to seperate them with a comma
[01:12:00] <sentiment> like selectedRoot.parent().parent().not("[level='1'],[level='2']")
[01:12:02] <sentiment> why ?
[01:12:43] <Cork> dimi1947: filter where?
[01:13:20] <Cork> dziegler: extension??
[01:13:31] <Cork> you mean like url/path/path/resource.array??
[01:14:03] <sentiment> it doesn't make sense to me. if it's a not operator, then the first one works correctly, but the second one does not
[01:14:15] <Cork> sentiment: .parent is not a searching function
[01:14:29] <Cork> it returns the parent if the selector matches, or nothing at all
[01:14:35] <dziegler> Cork: yes exactly i can choose some extension like .html, .json or .xml, and i can add .array as well for example...
[01:14:38] <Cork> .not would then filter that parent, not children of the parent
[01:14:51] <Cork> dziegler: http doesn't have extensions
[01:15:16] <Cork> you can call it resource.mysuperduperspecialabacadabraextensionresource
[01:15:19] <Cork> and noone will care
[01:15:32] <Cork> as long as the header Content-Type tells what content it has
[01:15:52] <Cork> json == application/json
[01:15:57] <Cork> html == text/html
[01:16:04] <dimi1947> $('#week').find('p');..this code gives me all p elements....I want to obtain the second ones only at each div
[01:16:04] <Cork> xml == application/xml
[01:16:27] <dziegler> Cork: i know, so if you request my PHP application with .json it will return you json encoded data, if you request it with .xml it will encode data as xml etc...
[01:16:57] <Cork> dziegler: the url is just a string to js, it has no knowledge about extensions
[01:17:07] <Cork> dziegler: if the server checks for the end of the url, fine
[01:17:10] <Cork> but js don't know or cares
[01:17:19] <dziegler> So is it possible to pass a list to javascript over ajax (that i dont need to sort in javascripit it self again because array is key value "save") and how does the reutnr needs to look like?
[01:17:49] <Cork> dziegler: no, you're still wrong
[01:17:53] <Cork> it isn't js vs json
[01:18:04] <Cork> its that objects aren't ordered
[01:18:05] <sentiment> Cork ".net would then filter that parent...."  right , but why doesn't it work when used without a comma seperator ?
[01:18:34] <dziegler> Cork: at the moment i return json, this is a object this is not ordered, wich is bad
[01:18:35] <Cork> sentiment: yes as in .parent('.c') === parent().not('.c')
[01:18:36] <sentiment> I have to set its parameter as multiple selectors. rather than a single attribute selector
[01:18:43] <dziegler> But you said a array is ordered
[01:18:52] <Cork> dziegler: so return json where you use an array instead
[01:19:07] <Cork> you don't have to go away from json, json is just a way to encode the data
[01:19:14] <Cork> it doesn't dictate you use objects
[01:19:28] <Cork> "[]" is a perfectly valid json string
[01:20:26] <Cork> sentiment: .not("[level='1'][level='2']") means "only elements that has level="1" AND level="2"
[01:20:48] <Cork> sentiment: .not("[level='1'],[level='2']") means "only elements that has level="1" OR level="2""
[01:21:16] <dziegler> Cork: i will come back to you in a few minutes... need to thing about something
[01:21:22] <sentiment> on a parent() only right ?
[01:21:32] <Cork> no
[01:21:35] <Cork> always
[01:21:46] <Cork> it's how css selectors work
[01:21:58] <sentiment> wait
[01:22:58] <Cork> sentiment: also note the quote i have is the selector and .not inverts that
[01:23:37] <Cork> so .not("[level='1'][level='2']") means "only elements that don't have level="1" AND level="2""
[01:23:46] <Cork> and .not("[level='1'],[level='2']") means "only elements that don't have level="1" OR level="2""
[01:24:23] <sentiment> I understand that but the fact that find() behaves differently confuses me
[01:24:41] <Cork> sentiment: could you make a jsfiddle with matching elements and so on?
[01:24:56] <Cork> it gets a bit messy having these long lines in irc
[01:25:09] <sentiment> are you implying that my dom might be the reason it acts like that ?
[01:25:21] <xec> not("[level='1'][level='2']") means "eh, anything"
[01:25:28] <Cork> ya
[01:25:40] <Cork> sentiment: no it think you're getting confused about selectors
[01:25:55] <Cork> and i need to explain the differences where you are confused
[01:26:04] <Cork> and a demo jsfiddle would make that much easier
[01:26:08] <sentiment> okay thanks
[01:27:37] <ilhami> anyone who has used the autocomplete in jQuery before?
[01:27:47] <Cork> ?ask @ ilhami
[01:27:47] <b-ot> ilhami: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:28:36] <ilhami> nothing is showing when I start inputting characters.
[01:28:51] <Cork> ilhami: are you using remote or local?
[01:28:57] <ilhami> remote
[01:29:05] <Cork> and is the server returning results?
[01:29:09] <ilhami> yeah
[01:29:17] <Cork> is the response formatted correctly=
[01:29:19] <Cork> *?
[01:29:25] <ilhami> [{"id":"1","city":"Hiller\u00f8d"}]
[01:29:34] <Cork> that's a no then
[01:29:43] <ilhami> what's wrong with that? lol
[01:29:47] <ilhami> it's valid json
[01:29:47] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[01:30:09] <Cork> ilhami: ya, but how is autocomplete suppose to know what key to look for?
[01:30:34] <ilhami> how do I specify?
[01:30:39] <Cork> you don't
[01:30:39] <ilhami> I want it to look for city.
[01:30:49] <ilhami> in that link you sent.
[01:30:50] <ilhami> Multiple types supported:
[01:30:51] <Cork> you have to translate if you want to send a none matching response
[01:30:55] <ilhami> An array of objects with label and value properties:
[01:31:25] <Cork> meaning use the function, grab the response and translate it to a [{label:, value:}] array
[01:31:33] <Cork> and give that to the response function
[01:32:12] <Cork> well or you can use the ["", "", ""] format if you only want one value for each
[01:32:23] <ilhami> you have a good example?
[01:32:33] <Cork> uh...
[01:33:25] <Cork> $.each(data, function() { this.label = this.city; });
[01:33:34] <Cork> for example
[01:33:39] <ilhami> let me show you what I have so far.
[01:34:07] <Cork> ilhami: you have what you need here http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[01:34:22] <Cork> the "Array" is the syntax you have to provide
[01:34:27] <Cork> one way or another
[01:34:39] <ilhami> https://dpaste.de/SOvB
[01:34:39] <Cork> extra keys is fine (and you can use them later)
[01:34:57] <Cork> ilhami: you can't give source a string
[01:35:02] <Cork> you have to translate the results
[01:35:10] <ilhami> I see. :P
[01:36:05] <ilhami> so it has to be an array
[01:36:20] <Cork> ilhami: you already have an array
[01:36:33] <Cork> the problem is you don't provide the values in it that autocomplete needs
[01:36:38] <Cork> specifically the label
[01:37:14] <ilhami> btw I need the id somehow as well.. from the array I showed you before.. but I don't want to display it.
[01:37:24] <ilhami> I only want it to display the city though.
[01:37:41] <Cork> i already answered that
[01:37:55] <Cork> ilhami: btw there is another option, but it is a bit more messy
[01:38:11] <Cork> you can override the _renderItem function
[01:38:21] <Cork> and use what ever key you want in the display there
[01:38:36] <ilhami> dude I just need the easiest solution. :P
[01:38:51] <Cork> the easy solution is to get the server to return label :)
[01:39:01] <Cork> then things just work
[01:39:11] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#method-_renderItem
[01:40:08] <ilhami> so the url should not be in the source.
[01:40:36] <Cork> ilhami: source can be the url, IF the server returns a response that autocomplete understands natively
[01:40:42] <ilhami> yeah.
[01:40:42] <Cork> OR if you override _renderItem
[01:41:14] <ilhami> ok let me try to override that ::)
[01:44:51] <lazymanc> I have a jquery object that doesn't properly reflect the classes on the dom element, so hasClass() fails: http://i.imgur.com/hCIO1M7.png
[01:45:23] <Cork> lazymanc: please don't ask us to debug images of you're code
[01:45:37] <Cork> either share the object in a jsfiddle or the code that generates it
[01:45:46] <ilhami> lol
[01:47:15] <sentiment> Cork https://jsfiddle.net/jgy37gq0/1/
[01:47:30] <lazymanc> Cork: I'm attempting to show that in chrome console, the dom node has the class and the jquery object doesn't
[01:47:47] <lazymanc> the code paste is coming
[01:48:01] <lazymanc> http://pastebin.com/AVVDqqe2
[01:48:33] <sentiment> this fiddle works correctly
[01:49:04] <sentiment> as long as there is not comma in the last selector
[01:49:09] <sentiment> *no comma
[01:50:17] <lazymanc> is there a common mistake that leads to jquery object reporting different classes than the dom node? If not I'll extract the code into a jsFiddle
[01:50:19] <sentiment> pardon the naming of vars as i borrowed them from our actual code base in which they make sense
[01:50:44] <sentiment> ... referring to selectedElements
[01:52:13] <shoky> lazymanc: no, the console doesn't necessarily show the DOM element that's wrapped inside the jquery object as an element, that's normal
[01:53:01] <Cork> sentiment: btw don't use level, it should be data-level
[01:53:12] <sentiment> but got it
[01:53:16] <Cork> sentiment: don't create random dom attributes outside the data- prefix
[01:53:17] <sentiment> ok
[01:53:35] <sentiment> got it , i was just silly, it was obvious, not paying attention i guess
[01:54:04] <sentiment> I wasn't thinking of the not() parameter as a selector
[01:55:12] <sentiment> there's no li which satisfies [level='1'][level='2']
[01:55:19] <sentiment> since it's an AND
[01:55:44] <shoky> lazymanc: also, you can see in the first line in your image that it doesn't have the "next" class. when you then expand the info in the console, it does show the next class. i'm guessing this is because when expanding an object in the console, chrome gives you a more live view
[01:55:54] <Cork> sentiment: looking through the code it looks like a jquery bug actually
[01:56:12] <sentiment> what?
[01:56:30] <Cork> .find('li') == 2,3,4; 2,3,4 .not(1,2) == 3,4, >1<!?!
[01:56:59] <Cork> so for some quite weird reason the not returns an element not in the original selection range
[01:57:02] <dziegler> Cork: i rebuild my data now { [ {key: 53, value foobar}, {key: 4, value zzz}] } im not happy with this but it works :/
[01:57:29] <sentiment> ok just when i thought i got it i'm back to step one
[01:57:31] <sentiment> thanks :p
[01:57:48] <Cork> sentiment: well selectedRoot.not("[level='1'][level='2']") === selectedRoot
[01:58:02] <Cork> sentiment: so that .not selection is pointless
[01:58:18] <Cork> the problem is  $( selectedRoot ).find("li").not("[level='1'],[level='2']") that behaves quite weird
[01:59:14] <Cork> sentiment: also note $.merge doesn't modify the first array
[01:59:18] <Cork> it returns the result
[01:59:24] <sentiment> it's selecting those elements with of one those levels and exluding it from the descendants of the selectedRoot. I mean that's how it should work anyway
[01:59:34] <sentiment> oh!
[01:59:48] <Cork> sentiment: yes, it is how it should work, but not messes up somehow
[01:59:59] <Cork> sentiment: that said, you might want to use classes instead
[02:00:08] <Cork> it would make this code quite a bit cleaner
[02:00:48] <lazymanc> shoky - but when my page first loads, the console shows the next class for both the jquery object and the dom node. Its only after my resizing code changes which steps have the next class that this starts to happen, so I think it's something to do with dynamically added classes
[02:01:03] <sentiment> are you sure about the merge ?
[02:01:22] <sentiment> it's working the same whether i use the return value or just the first parameter
[02:02:10] <Cork> sentiment: https://jsfiddle.net/jgy37gq0/3/
[02:02:11] <shoky> Cork: where are you getting the 1
[02:02:40] <Cork> shoky: $( selectedRoot ).find("li") == 2,3,4 for me, and the .not() returns 3,4,1
[02:03:14] <shoky> Cork: the second .not() returns 1
[02:03:17] <shoky> not the first
[02:03:27] <Cork> ah, wait...
[02:03:45] <Cork> i think it might be firefox old console bug biting me
[02:03:54] <shoky> ow
[02:05:09] <Cork> heh yup
[02:05:21] <shoky> and btw $.merge does mutate the first arg
[02:05:21] <Cork> cloning the result gives the correct result -_-'
[02:05:44] <dimi1947> cork did you look at all my problem?I was not in front of the PC
[02:06:38] <sentiment> to me it's working correctly now https://jsfiddle.net/jgy37gq0/4/
[02:07:21] <Cork> sentiment: can you use the class solution?
[02:07:29] <Cork> if you can that is the better option
[02:07:59] <ilhami> https://dpaste.de/T7JG
[02:08:01] <ilhami> Cork, ?
[02:08:04] <ilhami> what's wrong here?
[02:08:18] <sentiment> well I'll note it for consideration. thanks
[02:08:42] <sentiment> but can you explain a bit why ?
[02:10:23] <Cork> sentiment: cause classes is cached in the browser
[02:10:34] <Cork> so it can through :not make the selection very fast
[02:10:41] <Cork> while attributes means it has to walk the dom
[02:10:44] <shoky> lazymanc: anyways most likely it doesn't have the class when it hasClass returns false ;p not a jquery issue. this is why a jsfiddle was requested
[02:11:26] <Cork> sentiment: 1. you don't have to call autocomplete in a loop
[02:11:36] <Cork> 2. you still use item.label so... ya
[02:11:48] <shoky> ilhami*
[02:12:05] <Cork> opps
[02:12:06] <Cork> ya
[02:12:16] <lazymanc> shoky, understood, but I can see it has the class when I inspect the element, which is why it's weird. I'm currently creating a jsFiddle to try and replicate it outside of my app
[02:12:58] <shoky> lazymanc: if you inspect it while the debugger is paused inside your .each loop, i imagine it won't have the class
[02:12:59] <Cork> dimi1947: you will have to ask again, it's been a bit swamping here the last few minutes
[02:13:13] <ilhami> Cork, :P
[02:14:00] <lazymanc> shoky: I'll try that, cheers. Maybe it's a race condition with the code that switches the classes on resize
[02:14:11] <shoky> sounds like it
[02:14:49] <dimi1947> ok...
[02:15:33] <ilhami> I am trying Cork :P experimenting.
[02:16:32] <dimi1947> take a look at this fiddle...https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/b8bzq2xb/ there are 2 divs(one for each day)...inside of them there are 2 p elements...I want to target the second ones...which have class=fill...
[02:16:57] <Cork> ah right that one
[02:17:18] <Cork> dimi1947: where in the code do you want to do this selection?
[02:19:00] <dimi1947> you mean where the code must be placed?
[02:19:22] <Cork> dimi1947: i need to know the context of where you want to make the selection
[02:20:46] <dimi1947> #week...
[02:21:12] <dimi1947> it is the div that contains...the two days....I hope I uderstood well
[02:21:25] <Cork> dimi1947: uh i meant a line number in the script section
[02:21:35] <dimi1947> oh...
[02:22:04] <dimi1947> inside the save function would be just OK
[02:22:05] <lazymanc> shoky: you were correct, much appreciated
[02:22:38] <shoky> np lazymanc
[02:23:05] <ilhami> Cork, https://dpaste.de/7Nf9 still wrong?
[02:23:15] <Cork> dimi1947: ah so you don't have a namescope to help you
[02:23:48] <dimi1947> I di not understand...
[02:24:04] <Cork> dimi1947: well then how about $('#week .fill_monday') ?
[02:24:47] <Cork> dimi1947: you don't have to store the item in .data, autocomplete already keeps it around
[02:24:54] <Cork> except for that, no that looks fine
[02:25:22] <ilhami> you keep highlighting the wrong person lol
[02:25:30] <Cork> gah
[02:25:38] <Cork> ya, i'm trying to work along side so...
[02:25:48] <ilhami> :-P np
[02:28:45] <ilhami> still not working though.
[02:29:19] <Cork> ilhami: you don't get a dropdown?
[02:29:28] <Cork> is the function called?
[02:29:31] <ilhami> I get empty lis
[02:30:53] <ilhami> yeah the function is called.
[02:31:34] <ilhami> or not.
[02:31:34] <_Brandon_> hi, is there a plugin that loads another webpage without reloading the whole page and also changes the url?
[02:32:31] <Cork> _Brandon_: window.location = url?
[02:32:36] <ilhami> Cork, I set breakpoints but it doesn't seem to break :/
[02:32:55] <Cork> doesn't look like it get called then
[02:33:01] <Cork> uh.. hmm
[02:33:29] <Cork> ilhami: the each loop is needed around the .data('autocomplete')
[02:33:33] <Cork> that might be the problem
[02:33:47] <ilhami> I thought I should remove that lol. :P
[02:33:58] <Cork> $().autocomplete().each(function() { $(this).data('autocomplete') })
[02:34:06] <Cork> ya kinda, but not fully :)
[02:35:18] <ilhami> I just need a good example .. some kind of tutorial I can learn from.
[02:35:56] <_Brandon_> Cork: doesn't that redirect the browser to that url? what I want is something like I'm on the "Home" page, I click on "Contacts" and I want to load the content of the contacts page in the current page without reloading the whole page, but I also want the url to change, I can probably do this myself but I wonder if there is something already done
[02:36:37] <Cork> _Brandon_: then you don't want to load the full page
[02:36:52] <Cork> or rather you don't want "load another webpage" you want to load a partial
[02:36:58] <Cork> and yes you can do that

[02:37:43] <tr0n1c> Hello, I'm very new to javascript/jquery. I'm using getJSON() and was wondering if I can get the size (in bytes) of the downloaded data (e.g. like wget does). Thanks!
[02:38:03] <Cork> tr0n1c: no you don't
[02:38:10] <ilhami> you can use angularJS _Brandon_ :D
[02:38:17] <ilhami> easy to use framework
[02:38:25] <tr0n1c> Cork, is this due to getJSON() or another technical reason?
[02:38:32] <Cork> tr0n1c: you can see that info in the browser consoles network tab though
[02:38:50] <_Brandon_> ilhami: never used it before but I guess I'll take a look at it
[02:38:59] <Cork> tr0n1c: well as json is normally already parsed when you get it, you can't check the string length
[02:39:15] <Cork> tr0n1c: and that would be the only way to see that for ajax responses
[02:39:44] <Expel> Does anyone know why Masonry is not working, I'm trying out with the jQuery example code and I've set all the classes right and it still won't work.
[02:40:11] <Cork> Expel: how are we suppose to answer that?
[02:40:20] <tr0n1c> Cork, oh ok, makes sense. I'd like to display some debugging information on the fly, that's why. Thanks a lot!
[02:40:21] <Cork> "i have something here that isn't working, why?"
[02:40:43] <Cork> tr0n1c: the browser already displays that debug info
[02:40:45] <Cork> just use that
[02:41:39] <Expel> Cork: Alright, you're right. Could you please check my code and see if it's something wrong? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/fafe2ac5b3695dbc2c83 The masonry file is loading and the jQuery lib is also loading in fine.
[02:42:22] <Cork> Expel: uh, you have <script> inside you're .js file
[02:42:43] <Expel> Cork: No, it's under my footer, I'm using WP.
[02:43:02] <Cork> gistfile1.js: <script></script>
[02:43:50] <Expel> Cork: What you mean?
[02:44:05] <Cork> that the code you shared contradicts what you say
[02:44:30] <Expel> Cork: Yes, is it wrong in some way, or what?
[02:44:30] <usernamentoused> hey Cork, You got a min?
[02:45:27] <unnu> note to self, don't kick the router . . . it doesn't like that
[02:47:08] <ilhami> Cork, it works lolololol
[02:47:20] <ilhami> $('#city').autocomplete(autoc).data('ui-autocomplete')._renderItem = renderItem;
[02:47:25] <ilhami> I didn't need a each
[02:47:27] <ilhami> an*
[02:47:38] <ilhami> I just needed .data('ui-autocomplate')
[02:47:40] <Cork> ilhami: ya, as #city can only be one element
[02:47:40] <unnu> Cork, Remeber that thing with open office that you were telling me about building a pdf with? do you have a link for a tut on that or something? I was really wanting to do that for this project
[02:50:02] <Cork> unnu: http://ask.libreoffice.org/en/question/16757/about-using-odttemplate-file-and-xmldata-file-files-to-create-document-in-libreoffice/
[02:50:29] <Cork> unnu: you use open office templates and send it from the command line and it generates the document for you
[02:50:40] <unnu> sweet
[02:51:00] <Cork> ya it is kinda sweet
[02:51:04] <unnu> last question . . . is there a way to emulate a button-group behavior between unlinked buttons?
[02:51:07] <ilhami> #city is just a text input field :P
[02:51:29] <Cork> unnu:  a button group behavior?
[02:51:45] <Cork> you mean like a toggle button group?
[02:51:47] <unnu> like if i wanted "blah blah blah" <select button> <br> "Blah Blah la Dah" <select button>             (button group is a bootstrap thing)
[02:51:48] <unnu> yeah
[02:51:52] <unnu> toggle button group
[02:51:53] <unnu> lol
[02:52:00] <Cork> jquery ui provide that in there button plugin
[02:52:21] <unnu> k. . . I was using BS and it doesn't allow that at all http://jsfiddle.net/9eyxa40g/
[02:52:45] <unnu> even if the name attribute is the same . . . unless I am doing it wrong
[02:52:59] <Cork> unnu: https://jqueryui.com/button/#radio
[02:53:37] <Cork> but ya, you can do with <input type="radio"> + label + css
[02:53:50] <Cork> you don't even need js
[02:54:04] <unnu> apparently i suck at css then
[02:54:17] <unnu> to be fair i am a piss-poor programmer :( lol
[02:54:27] <nikhil_> how do i make a form submit when a file is chosen for a "file" type input?
[02:54:57] <Uhkis> unnu: self pity ain't pretty!
[02:55:48] <unnu> Uhkis, sarcasm isn't easy to convey through text i see
[02:56:02] <Uhkis> unnu: that's why sarcasm mark exists!
[02:56:10] <unnu> nikhil_, formData is cool https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[02:56:24] <Uhkis> this is so cool⸮
[02:56:35] <unnu> i just see a unicode block
[02:56:38] <unnu> no char there
[02:57:01] <Uhkis> you need a better font

[02:57:27] <unnu> BACKWARDS QUESTION MARK,
[02:57:28] <unnu> love it
[02:57:29] <unnu> lol
[02:57:48] <unnu> ⸮
[02:58:27] <Cork> unnu: http://jsfiddle.net/u0eLztp3/
[02:58:40] <Cork> extreamly skiply styled, but ya, it works
[02:58:57] <unnu> Cork,What i was asking was could i put them on their own line with text before it?
[02:59:12] <unnu> idk, I am trying to figure out how to make this data show up and not look like poop for mobile
[02:59:22] <unnu> (freaking mobile, always ruins it)
[02:59:43] <Cork> unnu: its just a label
[02:59:50] <Cork> you can put anything you like before them
[03:00:25] <unnu> I want to sepearte them tho
[03:00:35] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/u0eLztp3/1/
[03:00:56] <Cork> you just have to adjust how you want the styling to look
[03:01:16] <Cork> the important part is that the input is directly before the label
[03:01:24] <Cork> apart from that you can do basically anything you like
[03:01:28] <unnu> Cork, yous sexy . . . teach me your CSS ways
[03:02:08] <Cork> ya, i always try to solve as much as possible without js
[03:02:22] <Cork> it is kinda interesting :)
[03:03:06] <Uhkis> also: some ppl still disable js
[03:03:14] <Cork> i normally do ya
[03:03:17] <Cork> :)
[03:03:34] <unnu> Cork, That link i pmed you, the name of the class was a hover tooltip . . . you can't hover in mobile
[03:03:42] <unnu> so now i am trying to make it look pretty :(
[03:04:02] <Cork> unnu: you mean this link? * unnu ~usernamen@unaffiliated/unnu :is messaging you, and you have umode +g.
[03:04:03] <Cork> :)
[03:04:16] <unnu> lulz
[03:04:19] <unnu> geeze thanks
[03:04:50] <xqo> HI! I want the return value of DICT[1].get be a charcode (ie String.fromCharCode) when it is applied. How can I make it so? http://jsfiddle.net/y61vveLw/4/
[03:05:59] <Cork> xp: http://jsfiddle.net/y61vveLw/5/
[03:07:44] <xqo> Cork thank you very much
[03:12:44] <DragonPunch> \o
[03:14:54] <dimi1947> ok..let me see
[03:19:33] <dimi1947> yes...it works...of course there is a case this might not work...the fiddle you see does not have all the code in it...let me test things and get back to you IF the need arises
[03:21:00] <dimi1947> tell me this cork....what about if I want to target the p element in both days...or if there are more days...do I have to lisst all the relavant classes in the selector?
[03:21:27] <dimi1947> if we are talking  for the whole week this means....seven classes
[03:21:30] <Cork> dimi1947: your structure doesn't really allow anything else
[03:21:41] <Cork> an option would be to split the class name
[03:22:06] <dimi1947> yes....
[03:22:13] <Cork> dimi1947: personally i would move "monday" and so on to the wrapping parent
[03:22:23] <Cork> and have the rest use generic names like "from" "to" "fill"
[03:22:30] <Cork> that way you wouldn't have to duplicate the selectors
[03:22:52] <Cork> and if you want a specific one you would just do $('.monday .fill')
[03:23:51] <dimi1947> can You edit the fiddle I gave to understand better...IF you like
[03:24:25] <Cork> actually, you already have the id for the wrapper
[03:24:38] <Cork> to just remove _mond and _monday from the classes
[03:24:43] <Cork> to==so
[03:25:02] <Cork> (if _mond is meant to be monday else leave them)
[03:25:19] <unnu> is there an easy way to select a select group with no active selection?
[03:25:41] <Cork> a select group?
[03:25:54] <unnu> those radio inputs
[03:26:00] <Cork> ah, just give them a class
[03:26:08] <Cork> or you could use the name selector
[03:26:16] <Cork> though that is normally not a super good choice
[03:26:25] <Cork> $('[name="a"]')
[03:26:49] <unnu> Well I am automagically selecting previously clicked buttons from a database
[03:27:24] <Cork> unnu: then store the id of the input field and just do $('#' + id).prop('checked', true)
[03:27:26] <unnu> after i "click" all the buttons that have been previously "clicked" i want to see if there are any groups that have no selection and default them to the "nothing to see here" button
[03:28:56] <unnu> i suppose since they all share a class i can do $('.class').find('.default').addClass('active'); or somethign like that
[03:29:37] <Cork> unnu: depends on what you want to do
[03:29:49] <Cork> if you plan to use the solution i gave you before you need to set checked
[03:29:50] <Cork> not a class
[03:30:03] <xqo> in this reference https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays#Working_with_complex_data_structures it says: // ... read the data into the buffer ...
[03:30:06] <xqo> how do you do that?
[03:30:42] <Cork> ?mdn arraybuffer append
[03:30:45] <unnu> yeah, I am going to have to recode it before i go that route. Will take a few hours because rather than having php build the html I am going to try and send JSON back to the browser and have js/jquery build the html
[03:30:48] <b-ot> Cork: ArrayBuffer - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer
[03:31:03] <Cork> ah right they're static
[03:31:15] <Cork> unnu: just arr[index] = newData;
[03:31:41] <unnu> oh boy i wish it was that easy
[03:31:41] <unnu> lol
[03:32:01] <Cork> unnu: the simplest solution would be to just use .serializeArray
[03:32:13] <Cork> if you named the field correctly it would hold all the data you need
[03:32:53] <xqo> how do i give arraybuffers data? the type seems to be redundant cause it cant store anything?
[03:33:02] <unnu> well building the view is whats kicking my but because the info in the database i am working with is listed out by class session . . . and i have to turn that into an agenda view by time.
[03:33:04] <Cork> xqo: i just told you
[03:33:09] <Cork> 2 mins ago
[03:33:26] <xqo> Cork but they're static you said
[03:33:32] <xqo> and there's no append method
[03:33:37] <Cork> xqo: static length ya
[03:33:40] <Cork> ya
[03:33:47] <Cork> you set a length then you can fill that buffer
[03:33:49] <sentiment> i don't know why in the world does our manager favor asp razor.
[03:33:54] <Cork> you can't expand it
[03:34:02] <Cork> (then you have to create a new buffer)
[03:34:17] <sentiment> it's just unreadable to me , especially when done awkwardly
[03:34:52] <xqo> var real = new Uint8Array(new ArrayBuffer(8)).set([0x41, 0x42, 0x43]);
[03:34:53] <sentiment> freakin confuses me. bores me , makes it hard to read thru markup
[03:35:13] <sentiment> I'd do it all in js if i was the manager
[03:35:15] <xqo> i dont understand the use of the ArrayBuffer, why not just new Uint8Array([0x41, 0x42, 0x43])?
[03:35:59] <Cork> xqo: it works like array allocations in c
[03:36:07] <xqo> i dont know c
[03:36:12] <Cork> xqo: first you say "i need x byts of memory"
[03:36:18] <Cork> then you set the value to those bytes
[03:36:47] <xqo> ok, but doesnt new Uint8Array do all that for me? when do i ever need new ArrayBuffer?
[03:36:59] <Cork> so ex var arr = new ArrayBuffer(16); for(var i = 0; i < 16;i++) { arr[i] = data; }
[03:37:57] <Cork> xqo: also note that if you get the data you want to put into the array from ajax you can get an arraybuffer directly
[03:38:00] <xqo> ohh, you can do ArrayBuffer[index]
[03:38:10] <Cork> xqo: i've told you that twice...
[03:38:42] <xqo> yeah but i didnt realize what you were saying until now
[03:39:06] <xqo> thank you
[03:39:38] <Cork> xqo: also note that if you plan to store larger amount of entries you might want to use blob instead of bytearray
[03:39:45] <xqo> why is that?
[03:39:50] <Cork> as it doesn't require the data to be kept in ram
[03:40:06] <Cork> (blob can be backed by disk cache)
[03:40:14] <xqo> ok nice, thank you
[03:40:30] <Cork> but cause of this it has some more limitations
[03:40:40] <Cork> so they are really meant for different tasks
[03:40:49] <Cork> so check what matches what you want to do
[03:44:18] <xqo> Cork when storing data with a Uint16Array for example, can I set endianness somehow?
[03:46:01] <Cork> xqo: now you're gong to the edge of my knowledge :)
[03:46:30] <Cork> xqo: but normally in js you don't have control over endian, and i THINK that stands for the binary arrays too
[03:46:58] <xqo> DataView.getUint8 etc, all the get methods have a parameter that determines which endian to read as
[03:48:28] <Cork> xqo: sorry can't help you there
[03:48:32] <xqo> ok
[03:49:25] <Cork> xqo: but javascript has a hole normally follow 32bit x86 endian structures
[03:49:37] <xqo> ok
[03:49:47] <Cork> (and other bit commands)
[03:50:06] <xqo> The DataView and bytearray references mentions how its well optimized for performance; do you know whether it is very intensive to make many small DataViews all the time?
[03:50:43] <xqo> i mean, is it better for performance to keep one giant dataview you refresh when you need it, or to make many small new ones that you play with
[03:50:49] <Cork> xqo: i've basically only used bytearray and blob to handle file data
[03:51:06] <Cork> haven't done something where i've needed it since they created it
[03:51:28] <Cork> i have done it before with crazy array things
[03:52:43] <Cork> hmm
[03:52:47] <Cork> xqo: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DataView#Detect_endianness
[03:57:33] <xqo> Cork yes, but i was hoping there was a neat way to store values with the right endianness too, so that 0xFFD8 is not stored as \0xD8\0xFF
[03:57:43] <xqo> its ok, i can make a function to convert
[04:27:52] <toomus> Is it possible to fire next page with this plugin, but when page is scrolled to top instead of to bottom? https://github.com/infinite-scroll/infinite-scroll
[04:30:28] <donm2> hi I could really use another pair of eyes on this, I'm trying to get the date from the JqueryUI datepicker using $("#date").datepicker({ dateFormat: 'dd-mm-yy' }).val(); but I keep getting it in mm-dd-yy format or the actual output is 05/18/2015
[04:40:01] <shoky> donm2 is there an initial value on the <input> ?
[04:44:52] <ahmed> hello everyone
[04:45:58] <Guest7875> I used  activate_subpage("#carsInfo"); to open  a new subpage how can I close the current page before I open the new one ?
[04:47:22] <Cork> Guest7875: was that really meant to be asked here?
[04:47:44] <Guest7875> why not?
[04:47:55] <Cork> jquery doesn't have activate_subpage as far as i know
[04:48:04] <Cork> any flavor of it
[04:48:46] <makinen> why does datepicker show that it's wednesday today?
[04:49:04] <makinen> if I disable localization its working correctly
[04:49:27] <Cork> might be it changes timezone?
[04:49:28] <donm2> shoky : no it was on a div, but I've tried to intialise the datepicker with a format and it seems to be working
[04:49:30] <donm2> thanks
[04:49:45] <Guest7875> in jquery mobile
[04:54:29] <makinen> Cork: how can check it? this how I set the localization settings: http://pastebin.ca/2996582
[04:55:06] <pabl3ras> Quick question. I have this jQuery function I want to apply to multiple elements but not to all at the same time
[04:55:16] <pabl3ras> How could I do that?
[04:55:39] <toomus> recursion?
[04:55:56] <toomus> pabl3ras: recursion?
[04:56:52] <pabl3ras> toomus, give me 1 sec, I'm preparing a jsfiddle
[04:57:07] <Cork> ya, kinda hard to tell what you're trying to do from just that
[04:58:29] <pabl3ras> http://jsfiddle.net/gr632qrw/
[04:58:48] <pabl3ras> With a single image it works, of course
[04:59:04] <Cork> pabl3ras: never ever give setInterval/setTimeout a string
[04:59:18] <Cork> use setInterval(rotateImg, 1500)
[04:59:35] <Cork> or better yet setTimeout or $.animate
[04:59:46] <pabl3ras> All right
[05:01:22] <Cork> pabl3ras: also i'm still not sure what you mean by one at a time
[05:01:35] <Cork> what exactly is it you want to change from what is there now?
[05:01:54] <pabl3ras> Cork, let me explain, (sorry if my english is bad at some points)
[05:02:18] <toomus> pabl3ras: this $('.minit .active'); reutrns set of elements, not just one
[05:03:01] <pabl3ras> What I want to do is, to have a series of thumbnails groups, and when I hover one of them, it switches the images
[05:03:19] <Cork> pabl3ras: ok, then you need to change the hover at the bottom
[05:03:31] <Cork> so it can target the different groups
[05:03:49] <pabl3ras> How should I do it?
[05:03:49] <Cork> and then you need to forward the group you hover to the rotateImg function so it can select based on that
[05:04:01] <pabl3ras> Hmm
[05:04:22] <pabl3ras> I guess I get it :)
[05:05:22] <Cork> pabl3ras: something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/gr632qrw/1/
[05:05:24] <Cork> (untested)
[05:06:00] <pabl3ras> Aaaand it works :D
[05:06:45] <pabl3ras> Thanks a lot, I owe you a couple of beers :D
[05:06:57] <Cork> np
[05:12:13] <toomus> How to detect when div with overflow is srolled to top?
[05:13:15] <Cork> toomus: you would have to bind the scroll event and check scrollTop
[05:13:45] <Cork> ex. if(this.scrollTop < 13) { /* do something */ }
[05:15:21] <toomus> Cork: ok
[05:21:42] <toomus> Cork: this seems to not work for dynamic generated elements
[05:21:57] <Cork> toomus: ya, scroll doesn't bubble
[05:22:06] <Cork> you have to bind the element as they are added
[05:23:21] <toomus> Cork: how to bind in runtime?
[05:25:00] <toomus> bind('scroll', function () {...});?
[05:29:20] <xqo> i tried reading from an ArrayBuffer by making new arrays from it, but i just get empty arrays. what's wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/7xs77uLv/
[05:29:33] <xqo> im trying to do this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays#Working_with_complex_data_structures
[05:30:40] <Cork> toomus: the same way you would do normally, just after the element has been added
[05:30:58] <toomus> Ah, ok
[05:31:19] <Cork> xqo: you give an array buffer as a length value for new
[05:31:25] <Cork> that makes little sense
[05:31:49] <xqo> Cork that's what the mozilla reference i linked does
[05:32:33] <xqo> seemingly, anyway. we dont know what happens in the commented section
[05:32:36] <Cork> hmm apparently it should work
[05:32:39] <Cork> it didn't last i checked
[05:34:17] <samssh> I have several sibling elements, one of which will have an .active class. I need to transfer the class to another selected element. From that element is it better to select all siblings and removeClass() (el.siblings().removeClass("active")), or select only the sibling with '.active' (el.siblings(".active").removeClass("active")) ?
[05:34:50] <samssh> Obviously I'll add .active to the new element as well...
[05:35:38] <Cork> xqo: try asking in ##javascript they might have fiddled more with this then i have
[05:35:56] <xqo> ok!
[05:36:16] <Cork> samssh: those two should be about the same
[05:36:29] <Cork> the loop just happens in two different places
[05:36:43] <Cork> but it should be about the same loop
[05:37:23] <samssh> Cork, Ok, thanks. I'll use the first, since it's less top-level code.
[05:40:48] <xqo> Cork, i think maybe loading data with [] is not the way to do it. The DataView also reads 0, http://jsfiddle.net/7xs77uLv/1/
[05:45:32] <Cork> xqo: why do you use both uint8 and buffer?
[05:45:58] <Cork> xqo: http://jsfiddle.net/7xs77uLv/2/
[05:46:28] <xqo> oh, thank you
[05:46:38] <Cork> lol just me hacking based on mdn :)
[05:46:44] <Cork> i've never used this my self
[05:47:20] <xqo> this is also interesting, http://jsfiddle.net/7xs77uLv/3/
[05:47:49] <xqo> they all just change the same buffer, forget the dataviews. now i understand.
[05:47:52] <Cork> xqo: i would recommend wrapping commands from for in a block
[05:48:06] <Cork> its a common source of bugs (and my guts hurt every time i see it)
[05:48:11] <xqo> ok
[05:48:15] <xqo> then i will
[05:48:51] <Cork> heh it's your code, just a recommendation ^^
[05:49:25] <Cork> xqo: the reason is that you can get things like for(terms) command1();command2;
[05:49:29] <Cork> and then it gets scary
[05:49:41] <Cork> or ppl linebreak and it gets even more scary
[05:51:06] <xqo> no, i trust you, and i will not argue with convention to save 2 lines.
[05:52:25] <Cork> xqo: http://jsfiddle.net/1j48hLw4/
[05:52:30] <Cork> i've seen things like this
[05:52:42] <Cork> and that is why i have a bad feeling about them
[05:52:55] <Cork> also jslint and jshint complains about them for the same reason
[06:20:16] <donm2> does anyone know of html 5 type editor plugin like what is used in fiddler sites ?
[06:20:52] <donm2> e.g I can enter html and create css classes and see it live
[06:25:07] <bigmac> im looking for a scroll loading effect, i have tried scrollstop.js
[06:25:51] <bigmac> i dont like how each frame loaded needs to be a web.doc (page.html)
[06:27:20] <toomus> How to find link with rel="next nofollow"?
[06:27:39] <Cork> $('a[rel="next nofollow"]')
[06:27:59] <toomus> but nofollow is radom
[06:28:07] <toomus> *random
[06:28:27] <Cork> not sure what you mean
[06:28:29] <toomus> some links has it, and some not
[06:28:51] <Cork> try $('a[rel*="next"]')
[06:29:38] <Crucials> ^ that looks like magic to me
[06:29:43] <toomus> works :)

[06:30:01] <Cork> Crucials: ^
[06:30:52] <toomus> How can I trigger click event on this link?
[06:31:07] <Cork> you can't
[06:31:23] <Cork> you can copy the url and do window.location = href
[06:31:32] <toomus> something like trigger('click');
[06:31:40] <Cork> won't work
[06:31:44] <toomus> It is ajax link
[06:31:47] <Cork> ah
[06:31:55] <Cork> well ya, you can trigger event handlers that way
[06:32:01] <Cork> but not the default action
[06:38:47] <cool_boy> $('#discount-card-select').attr('value'); returns me correct value of 'value' attribute but $('#discount-card-select').attr('value2');  returns undefined even if 'value2' is available
[06:38:52] <cool_boy> :s
[06:39:13] <Cork> cool_boy: don't create random attributes like that
[06:39:17] <Cork> use the data- prefix
[06:39:31] <Cork> <input data-value=""> is fine
[06:39:40] <Cork> <input value2=""> is not
[06:40:16] <cool_boy> Cork: but can I read value of 'data-value' then?
[06:40:24] <cool_boy> was just testing
[06:40:28] <cool_boy> I get undefined
[06:40:31] <Cork> .attr('data-value') should work just fine
[06:41:31] <Cork> cool_boy: also btw, use .val() not attr('value')
[06:41:59] <cool_boy> Cork:  I get value from .val() but I need another attribute
[06:42:03] <cool_boy> that I am not getting
[06:42:10] <Cork> cool_boy: http://jsfiddle.net/wv19dmkj/
[06:42:42] <Crucials> i think, if you set the values originally via jquery, isnt it better to do .data('value')?
[06:42:53] <Cork> Crucials: depends
[06:43:11] <Cork> if you need it to be a dom attribute you can't use .data
[06:43:25] <Cork> as it will update jquerys internal cache instead
[06:43:51] <Cork> but yes, normally .data is a better choice
[06:45:37] <toomus> How to prevent overflow div to scroll to top, when new data from ajax request is appended?
[06:45:57] <Cork> toomus: don't empty the element before updating it
[06:46:27] <toomus> Cork: I don't. Just append.
[06:46:41] <Cork> toomus: it shouldn't scroll up if you do
[06:46:44] <cool_boy> Cork: how do I get values from selection http://jsfiddle.net/wv19dmkj/2/
[06:48:00] <Cork> cool_boy: http://jsfiddle.net/wv19dmkj/4/
[06:48:18] <toomus> Cork: when user scroll div to top, there is on scroll event which returns $('some data').prependTo('div');
[06:48:50] <Cork> try rephrasing that
[06:48:56] <Cork> cause that comment doesn't make sense
[06:49:13] <Cork> why should the event return prependTo?
[06:50:20] <toomus> there is some div (chat box) with overflow. When user scroll this box to top, I want to load older messages with ajax request, which is triggered by on scroll event
[06:50:35] <Crucials> ah
[06:50:49] <Crucials> so how much of that have you got working?
[06:51:42] <Cork> toomus: modifying the content of an element doesn't change its scroll position
[06:51:46] <cool_boy> Cork: thank you
[06:52:06] <Cork> toomus: so the scroll position has to be updated to "keep the current position"
[06:52:27] <toomus> ajax request is teiggered, messages are generated and appear in box, but after messages arrive, chat box is scrolling to top, which should not happen, because this make another ajax call
[06:52:31] <Cork> and if the user is currently dragging the scroll block you can't do that
[06:52:40] <Cork> so you will end up in an infinite loop of loading more content
[06:53:32] <Crucials> what you can do on load toomus, is find how much content you are adding (height), and set your .scrollTop(height)
[06:53:38] <toomus> exactly, infinite loop untill there is nothing more to load :/
[06:54:04] <Cork> no you can't update the scroll position while the user is scrolling
[06:54:17] <Crucials> also set some boolean to false to block any more ajax loading
[06:54:25] <Crucials> and you can reset it when the user lets go, or whatever else you figure out
[06:54:45] <Cork> also i don't think you get an event for that either :/
[06:55:20] <Cork> i think chat clients usually don't use the built in scroll box cause of this
[06:55:35] <Cork> but haven't looked into that my self
[06:55:51] <toomus> Crucials: I remove link just after ajax request, so it happen only once, and add it again in server side response
[06:56:15] <Crucials> can you set overflow:hidden to force the user to let go
[06:56:21] <Crucials> and then re-add it
[06:56:29] <Crucials> im not sure
[06:56:41] <Cork> that would cause the scrollbar to flicker
[06:56:49] <Cork> but ya, it might work, not sure
[06:57:21] <Cork> a better choice might be to have a filler element at the top and add the content you haven't loaded after that
[06:57:26] <Cork> and adjust the size of the filler element
[06:57:40] <Cork> that way the scrollbar shows constant size
[06:57:47] <Cork> and things gets less confusing
[06:58:21] <Cork> i guess you have a max length back in time they can scroll so it would only have to mimic that amount
[06:59:51] <DragonPunch> ContentEditable is soo stupid.
[06:59:54] <toomus> Cork: I'm confused
[07:01:14] <toomus> Thx guys for help, I will try your ideas :)
[07:01:46] <Cork> toomus: the core of the problem comes from that you are currently fighting with the user about the scroll position :)
[07:02:06] <Cork> and yes, infinite scroll is a lot harder to do backwards
[07:06:48] <Crucials> well, how are you checking the scroll toomus?
[07:07:37] <Crucials> because im trying to replicate and realized it shouldnt be a problem, because the scroll event only triggers when the user actually scrolls
[07:16:53] <Orien> hey people .. is it possible while in a ajax call to get responses from the php file .. to do a loading bar ?
[07:17:42] <Orien> lets say i call hello.php and im my code i so a syncronization between sql and mysql and after each query i send msg 20% ... 40% .. and i read that values
[07:19:41] <cool_boy> Cork: in one of my method where I tested "var selected = $('#discount-card-select option:selected').attr('data-value');"  it is working, but where I need to implement it, it is not working
[07:19:43] <cool_boy> any idea?
[07:20:04] <cool_boy> onchange <select> it is working
[07:48:07] <Peter_Occ> I'm trying to detect an enter key in an ajax generated textarea. In this code, #member-details exists when the page is loaded but the textarea does not, so enter is not detected. I looked for examples using on() with enter but I couldn't find any. http://jsfiddle.net/z8p2nj20/
[07:51:40] <nbt> Peter_Occ: make that code run just after the textarea is added to the document
[07:51:54] <decx> $( "#member-details").on('keypress', 'textarea', function(event){
[07:53:56] <Peter_Occ> Thanks, decx, Thought I tried that, but your code did work
[08:12:09] <lazymanc> sometimes I see (function() { // ...snip... }()); in js files, is it something to do with scope? Finding it difficult to google, what's it called please?

[08:19:03] <decx> googelable
[08:19:10] <decx> googullible

[08:51:13] <LB> Special character issue with $.each and selecting <li> options for ajax call.  When you use $.each for JSON to load <li> items as seen here: https://jsfiddle.net/creatordotjs/wmwwktyp/
[08:51:25] <robertmaxrees> that's an empty fiddle.
[08:51:27] <LB> Fiddle doesn't work- just snippets of code
[08:51:47] <robertmaxrees> there's no code in the fiddle at all fwiw
[08:51:53] <LB> https://jsfiddle.net/creatordotjs/wmwwktyp/1/
[08:52:29] <LB> I have working example here: http://qfloors.com/qorders/
[08:52:39] <LB> username: Oggie
[08:52:45] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[08:52:46] <LB> pword: o
[08:52:50] <robertmaxrees> slow down - example data?
[08:52:57] <robertmaxrees> instead o making me log into your site.
[08:53:52] <LB> When working with special characters like Test'"\"\
[08:54:02] <robertmaxrees> where?
[08:54:12] <robertmaxrees> (that's where the sample data comes in handy"
[08:55:07] <LB> ISorry. I don't have sample data on the jsfiddle
[08:55:29] <robertmaxrees> right, i'm asking you to put some in there :)
[08:56:04] <LB> jGot it. I'll have to come back because this just has snippets of code.
[08:56:07] <LB> it won't work.
[08:56:26] <robertmaxrees> which is ok.  i just need a sample of the data you're having trouble with.
[08:56:47] <decx> how'd that appointment go robertmaxrees?
[08:57:02] <LB> Test '\"\;"
[08:57:12] <robertmaxrees> LB the actual JSON.  in the fiddle please :)
[08:57:17] <robertmaxrees> decx not at all like i wanted it to, actually.
[08:57:28] <decx> yikes
[08:57:31] <decx> well get well
[08:57:34] <decx> or stay well ^^
[08:57:46] <robertmaxrees> haha, i can't really.  genetic predisposition to absurdly high bp.
[08:58:53] <robertmaxrees> everything else is absolutely normal.  sodium's good, cholestorol is good, etc.
[08:59:34] <decx> i have to get checked out at some point too, havent been to a doctor apart from vacination for like 15 years
[09:00:02] <robertmaxrees> heh, i hadn't been either until i had a migraine for 2 weeks and almost got admitted to the ER because my BP was so high.
[09:00:27] <LB> robert - something like this? https://jsfiddle.net/creatordotjs/wmwwktyp/2/
[09:00:37] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[09:00:47] <robertmaxrees> so first off, you don't need $.each() in this case.
[09:02:00] <robertmaxrees> unless you need to support IE8
[09:02:27] <decx> two weeks of migraine yuk
[09:02:35] <robertmaxrees> second of all - what do you want cases like "Special '\"'\\" to display like, LB?
[09:02:35] <LB> No - don't need to support IE8
[09:03:00] <LB> Special '\"'\\
[09:03:54] <LB> A user will input anything - even special characters
[09:04:07] <robertmaxrees> ah okay.  that's what you're accounding for.
[09:04:11] <LB> So I'm testing this extreme example
[09:04:39] <LB> Yes - the app works with everything but these characters
[09:04:53] <LB> it loads and displays fine
[09:05:02] <robertmaxrees> you're going to have some serious problems then.
[09:05:14] <LB> but then I select an option with these characters and it takes the val()
[09:05:35] <robertmaxrees> because "typeName": "type'\"\\", won't ever work.  you need to escape those backslashes.
[09:05:51] <LB> and when I pass back to ajax call it of course doesn't take the whole val() because of escape characters
[09:06:06] <robertmaxrees> right, you need to encode this data differently.
[09:06:29] <robertmaxrees> do this: hit https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wmwwktyp/3/ and open your dev tools.
[09:06:36] <LB> Right - if a user is entering it though - how do I deal with that.
[09:06:50] <robertmaxrees> you need to encode it on your backend.
[09:07:00] <robertmaxrees> and properly escape it.
[09:08:43] <LB> so, I think we got to that point - because it will load and look correct on type, but the issue comes when the user selects a type to pass that back to an ajax call
[09:08:53] <LB> to get the area
[09:08:58] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:09:05] <robertmaxrees> open your dev tools and check out my last fiddle.
[09:09:18] <LB> okay
[09:09:21] <LB> checking
[09:10:01] <robertmaxrees> you need to actually escape things on input/output from your backend.
[09:10:06] <robertmaxrees> that'll solve your headaches here.
[09:15:12] <LB> I appreciate your help. I
[09:20:21] <ilhami> robertmaxrees, so always escape from backend?
[09:20:56] <ilhami> instead of using html , val functions?
[09:22:59] <robertmaxrees> ilhami basically.  malicious users and all that
[09:23:06] <robertmaxrees> and in thsi case there's nothing you can do client-side.
[09:24:03] <ilhami> so how should you escape a json object?
[09:24:23] <robertmaxrees> you're thinking of it the wrong you.  you want ot escape the strings in the object.
[09:24:58] <ilhami> well what if you just pass a json object to the client? then it should be escaped on the client side?
[09:25:18] <ilhami> I mean the API just sends a json object to the client, what then?
[09:25:26] <robertmaxrees> it should do more than just send data.
[09:25:38] <robertmaxrees> the backend for that api should strip out anything malicious.
[09:25:47] <robertmaxrees> be it on input or output.
[09:37:20] <ilhami> ok I will check the possibilities.
[09:37:20] <cool_boy> how do I get  ' fixed:12' separated in array ['fixed', '12']
[09:37:49] <cool_boy> got it thanks
[09:56:04] <Orien> hey guys my progress bar in jquery ui is not showing progress .. from 5 to 5 seconds i call a ajax function to go read a number on database and return it but i'm doing ProgressBar.progressbar('value', data.percent); and is not moving ,.. but my console log shows me data.percent = 40 per example
[09:57:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:58:17] <Orien> i'm trying to update progress bar from jquery ui every 5 seconds
[09:58:27] <Orien> with a value that comes frm a ajax call that is data.percent
[10:04:46] <robertmaxrees> share some code.
[10:04:54] <robertmaxrees> becuase there could be all kinds of things going wrong.
[10:10:38] <Orien> robertmaxrees i managed to do it
[10:10:45] <Orien> parseInt(data.percent)
[10:11:50] <Orien> the thing is ... i dont find this a good idea
[10:12:07] <Orien> http://pastebin.com/BXMd4N2H
[10:12:07] <Orien> this is my code to give me the percentage
[10:12:07] <tasaif> what's not a good idea?
[10:12:31] <Orien> and i'm updating a value on a table after each process is complete ...
[10:12:45] <Orien> this is a sincronization of tables from SQL to MySQL
[10:12:54] <Orien> each table is a percentage that i send to a table
[10:13:13] <Orien> then every 5 seconds i go read this code with ajax -> http://pastebin.com/BXMd4N2H
[10:13:20] <Orien> then update the progress var with the value from that code
[10:13:25] <robertmaxrees> thats the same link Orien
[10:13:59] <Orien> its the code that matters actualy .. the other is a setInterval 5seconds doing the ajax call of that code
[10:14:17] <robertmaxrees> i wouldm't use setinterval here. or ever, really.
[10:14:25] <robertmaxrees> and that sounds like more of a php problem then :)
[10:14:37] <Orien> its both problems
[10:14:48] <robertmaxrees> then show your js.
[10:14:48] <Orien> its bad cause i'm always opening a connection to database to read the progress
[10:15:40] <Orien> http://pastebin.com/hg9nV7UB
[10:15:53] <Orien> that is the 5 second interval to read the other pastebin page
[10:16:06] <tasaif> Orien this might be an opportunity to use Websockets
[10:17:13] <Orien> gotta learn something new every day :D
[10:17:15] <robertmaxrees> and you don't want intervals here.
[10:17:16] <Orien> i'll investigate
[10:17:22] <robertmaxrees> you want timeouts.
[10:17:36] <robertmaxrees> you have no guarantee that the ajax call will complete in time for the next one to kick off.
[10:18:02] <Orien> i kinda have
[10:18:08] <Orien> its my server only do that
[10:18:29] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to similate timeouts.
[10:34:42] <tasaif> Orien: I believe what robertmaxrees is saying is that you should put your next ajax call inside the success or error callbacks of your initial call
[10:35:08] <tasaif> everyone hit the deck, here comes recursion
[10:35:52] <randomguy1> can i hit my desk instead?
[10:36:16] <tasaif> that answer is within you
[10:36:22] <randomguy1> lol
[10:41:02] <Orien> tasaif this is a simple sync its used once a day ... i think its ok for now .. for a more complex project i'll try that
[10:41:27] <tasaif> I thought you were looping every 10 seconds?
[10:41:33] <tasaif> to update the progress bar
[10:41:41] <Orien> yes i am the site is like this
[10:41:46] <Orien> you have charts everywhere
[10:41:58] <Orien> then once a week you may update it with new information
[10:42:04] <Orien> when  you press sync new page opens ...
[10:42:13] <Orien> in that page 5 from 5 seconds it updates de progress bar
[10:42:31] <Orien> after its finished it stops the timer and goes back to the main site with new data
[10:43:09] <Orien> this sync takes 2 minutes ... this progress is for the client to see something is happening cause sometimes they closed the sync process at midle they though nothing was behing done
[10:43:35] <Orien> now they see a bar moving every 5 seconds .. and they know something is being done ...
[10:50:03] <Orien> but since its not going to be run every single hour its ok
[10:50:08] <Orien> and also its my dedicated server
[10:50:12] <Orien> only storing this database
[10:51:20] <randomguy1> how often is this percentage changing?
[10:51:33] <randomguy1> not how often you request it, but how often can it change?
[10:52:52] <Orien> randomguy1 the first 5 seconds changes from 0 to 16% after that goes to 60%
[10:52:52] <Orien> then takes a while to 100%
[10:53:11] <Orien> some table have more rows than other
[10:53:31] <randomguy1> with in a given 5 second timeframe, can the percentage change more than once?
[10:53:54] <Orien> maybe but not always
[10:54:45] <Orien> the problem is .. some tables only get new rows .. other table get the whole table
[10:55:00] <Orien> in the only new rows ... its fast .. maybe 10 seconds for 5 tables
[10:55:09] <Orien> not even 10 seconds .. maybe less
[10:55:16] <Orien> after those tables its takes a while
[10:56:02] <randomguy1> then what tasaif and maxres said is true.  there is the chance that the user could see the percentage drop with the manner in which you are using the ajax.  there is no guarentee that the ajax request will return within 5 seconds, always.  it may 99.9% of the time, however one cannot guarentee network performance.  you may fine that low probability acceptable, but it none the less exists.
[10:57:28] <Orien> it cant get go backwards cause the value is stored on a table
[10:57:44] <Orien> the thing is .. in the time frame it can get the same value many times
[10:57:52] <randomguy1> with asynchronus ajax calls you cannot guarentee that one request will return before another
[10:58:05] <Orien> lets think like this
[10:58:09] <randomguy1> one request that got 5% could return after one that returns 7%
[10:58:15] <Orien> Sync || ProgressBar
[10:58:22] <Orien> 0 || 0
[10:58:33] <Orien> 1 || 8%
[10:58:36] <Orien> 2 || 16%
[10:59:13] <randomguy1> your missing the issue.  it is not an issue with storage.  it is an issue with asynchronus actions
[10:59:48] <Orien> but if it takes more than 5 seconds to get the data
[11:00:03] <Orien> it wil lget a lower value first then a higher value after
[11:00:07] <randomguy1> not to get the data, to return the result.  to make the return trip to the user
[11:00:43] <Orien> i'm going to make some tests and see if that can happen
[11:01:01] <Orien> im going to simulate slow connections etc
[11:02:37] <Orien> i have to go ,.. tomorrow we continue this topic and i'll tell you if that can occur
[11:02:43] <Orien> cya tomorrow and thank you people
[11:33:22] <jwmann_> How would I check to see if a custom jquery plugin method exists? Would is be something like: if ( $.fn.mycustommethod === undefined ) ?
[11:34:25] <randomguy1> typeof <object> === "undefined"
[11:34:48] <snover> jwmann_: that’s a fine way to do it.
[11:36:00] <jwmann_> Would $.fn.mycustommethod be considered an object?
[11:37:01] <snover> functions are objects but they have their own typeof type
[11:37:07] <jwmann_> Oh
[11:55:59] <robertMeeting> you could also just do if ($.fn.mycustommethod) {} since undefined and null are falsy.
[11:59:03] <pauled> Hi, how I can check in console if a element exist? typing this $('div.table.finished > div.control.buttons > a.button.hint--bottom:eq(1) [href]') that return []
[11:59:30] <decx> that selector is out of control
[11:59:49] <decx> and generally you use .length
[12:00:52] <pauled> $('div.table.finished').length return 0
[12:01:18] <decx> then there is no finished table
[12:01:31] <kevireilly> pauled: is there a div element with two classes table and finished on it?
[12:01:55] <pauled> right there is gone
[12:01:58] <pauled> but
[12:02:18] <pauled> $('.table').length return 1
[12:02:34] <AoiC> table is an element though - not a class, isn't it?
[12:02:37] <robertMeeting> div.table.finished looks for a div with the classes "table" and "finished"
[12:02:49] <robertMeeting> something like div class="table finished"
[12:02:51] <pauled> ok got it
[12:03:26] <AoiC> does it really? I thought it'd look for a div with the class "table" and within that div (with class="table") for an element of the class "finished"?
[12:03:34] <robertMeeting> nope.
[12:03:36] <robertMeeting> no spaces.
[12:03:49] <robertMeeting> that'd be 'div.table .finished'
[12:04:00] <pauled> .table is class here
[12:04:10] <AoiC> yeah.
[12:04:24] <AoiC> hm fine though D: I guess robert is right
[12:04:32] <robertMeeting> css 101 :)
[12:04:50] <AoiC> actually the jquery selectors confuse me .. because they are not 100% identical to css ones
[12:04:59] <robertMeeting> they are, actually.
[12:05:00] <robertMeeting> well.
[12:05:04] <robertMeeting> css plus some extra goodies.
[12:05:56] <pauled> I am trying to made a userscript for lichess.org, and this site use ajax, so the class .finished gone after session timeout or something
[12:06:05] <AoiC> what if he wrote $('div .table .finished') ?
[12:06:31] <robertmaxrees> AoiC that's looking for an element with the class finished inside the class table within a div.
[12:06:39] <robertmaxrees> *all elements, actually.
[12:06:59] <AoiC> alright
[12:07:34] <robertmaxrees> the space basically means "any descendent of".  of like if you did $('div').find('.table').find('.finished');
[12:08:55] <pauled> there is a link that look like that without href <a class="button disabled">Rematch</a>
[12:09:07] <AoiC> ah .. and no space means element (if there is an element prepending the class definitions) with the following classes..
[12:09:30] <robertmaxrees> AoiC no space means "has all these things"
[12:09:35] <AoiC> Looks okay to me.. though I think I usually add href="#" ..
[12:09:40] <pauled> I can click on it when there is no .disabled class. But how is possible without href
[12:09:41] <robertmaxrees> so you could do div#someId.someClass
[12:09:54] <robertmaxrees> pauled anchors aren't required to have hrefs.
[12:09:57] <robertmaxrees> event bindings.
[12:10:21] <robertmaxrees> AoiC you're conflating concepts.  i'd go read a css tutorial on selecting :)
[12:10:26] <pauled> but is not an anchor like for table of content
[12:10:29] <AoiC> robert - so div#someId.someClass would pick <div id="someId" class="someClass">...</div>?
[12:10:35] <randomguy1> lol, i see href="#" a lot in my apps.  drives me crazy
[12:10:38] <robertmaxrees> AoiC yep.
[12:10:47] <robertmaxrees> PaulCapestany that's still an anchor tag.
[12:10:47] <AoiC> ok o.o
[12:10:50] <robertmaxrees> err, pauled
[12:11:01] <robertmaxrees> AoiC that selector is redundant though.  #someId is enough in that case.
[12:11:03] <robertmaxrees> since IDs are unique.
[12:11:15] <AoiC> or are supposed to be so within the scope of a page :D
[12:11:18] <robertmaxrees> and prepending selectors with tags is usually something you should avoid.
[12:11:35] <robertmaxrees> if you repeat an ID more than once on a given page, it's not a valid page.
[12:11:52] <AoiC> well I don't, but I saw pages...
[12:12:03] <robertmaxrees> doesn't make it valid ;)
[12:12:08] <AoiC> nevermind though - I know ID should be unique (unlike "name" attribute, which is not meant to be so)
[12:12:08] <pauled> yeah #id is supposed to be unique in the page
[12:13:42] <pauled> I am on page, I have to found a pattern to trigger .clic
[12:14:04] <pauled> is not easy since the page is dynamic
[12:14:29] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:14:54] <pauled> yeah, suppose I play chess versus human opponent
[12:15:58] <AoiC> pualed just track the report and the changes they make to the DOM - and use a selector.. o.o;
[12:16:08] <pauled> if they are on board, the button have one stat, if they left on another page, the button get another stat, anf if they left from the site, the button get another stat
[12:16:28] <robertmaxrees> so you want to know when the button changes?
[12:17:23] <pauled> I want to rematch him, and if they left I want clic to another button available to find another opponent
[12:18:02] <pauled> very hard to reproduce this on fiddle
[12:18:08] <robertmaxrees> sooo... for starters, you want to know when the button changes?
[12:18:32] <pauled> yeah
[12:18:46] <pauled> not sure what I want technicaly
[12:18:47] <robertmaxrees> since it's a userscript: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[12:20:41] <pauled> first one problem is the URL, there is no pattern to trigger the function
[12:20:51] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:20:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:21:10] <robertmaxrees> how much experience do you have with javascript?
[12:21:22] <pauled> 1 week ^^
[12:21:29] <AoiC> oh hehe ...
[12:21:44] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so back up further - start with the first problem you need to solve.
[12:22:31] <AoiC> that MutationObserver is only compatible with IE11 (and up, I guess)...
[12:22:39] <robertmaxrees> right, he's making a userscript.
[12:22:45] <robertmaxrees> otherwise i wouldn't suggest using it.
[12:23:28] <AoiC> What I find most interesting in that chess example, is, how to properly find out if a player is still on the page? AJAX isn't a great approach there.. I'd probably try to fiddle with websockets for bi-directional communication
[12:23:42] <robertmaxrees> they don't host the page.
[12:23:48] <AoiC> ah...
[12:23:54] <AoiC> ignore me then :X
[12:23:54] <robertmaxrees> hence the userscript ;)
[12:24:09] <AoiC> that's what I get for not reading all of the conversation beforehand hehe
[12:24:14] <robertmaxrees> nah it's all good.
[12:24:34] <AoiC> Nevertheless though.. how would one determine if someone left the website?
[12:24:46] <AoiC> like .. if I was coding and hosting something myself
[12:25:09] <robertmaxrees> depends on the technologies available.  sockets would be a good choice
[12:25:35] <AoiC> yeah .. before websockets, I'd have used AJAX "I am alive"-signals or something .. but they are not really great ...
[12:25:54] <AoiC> for sockets.. if one is closed, that means the user is offline or moved on to a different website
[12:26:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah, there are a few different ways to approach that.
[12:26:41] <AoiC> but I think there is no way of having a Javascript report something right before the page is changed, is there?
[12:27:27] <kevireilly> AoiC: there is the beforeunload event
[12:27:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah, though you can't guarantee much in there.
[12:27:55] <AoiC> oh - there is? and it's called before the browser window is closed or the url is changed?
[12:28:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah, but you can't guarantee that anything in it completes.
[12:28:12] <AoiC> ah .. so not reliable enough
[12:29:23] <pauled> robertmaxrees: I mentioned you in line 27 :) https://openuserjs.org/scripts/mawekuwe/Lichess_Topbar_Menu/source
[12:30:00] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[12:42:50] <nikio_> robertmaxrees, why does it say to assign both name and id?
[12:42:51] <nikio_> http://stackoverflow.com/a/323141
[12:43:01] <nikio_> i am trying to achieve that^
[12:43:36] <tasaif> I think name is the archaic form of id
[12:43:50] <tasaif> and some old bits of the browser still use it
[12:43:53] <tasaif> like how forms use it
[12:44:08] <tasaif> or class
[12:44:10] <tasaif> or whatever
[12:44:16] <tasaif> either way names are stupid
[12:44:42] <pauled> not sure if my code is correct: http://fiddle.jshell.net/jakngzbj/
[12:45:22] <AoiC> name attribute is used in form-elements as variables, that are sent over to the server-script
[12:45:34] <nikio_> tasaif, yet it dosnt work
[12:45:50] <tasaif> AoiC: they should just use classes
[12:45:55] <AoiC> also if you are making a group of e.g. radio-buttons, you would probably use the same name for every element with a different value
[12:46:10] <AoiC> why use classes? there can be several classes at once..
[12:46:23] <tasaif> so?
[12:46:34] <tasaif> do a select serverside
[12:46:47] <AoiC> why transmit more data to the server than necessary?
[12:47:08] <nikio_> this is the code and it doesnt work, untill i execute it in the console manually
[12:47:10] <tasaif> because it's cleaner
[12:47:10] <nikio_> $("bom").ready(function () {	
[12:47:10] <nikio_> 	$('#bom').contents().find('.dg').hide();	
[12:47:10] <nikio_> });
[12:47:13] <tasaif> imagine
[12:47:31] <tasaif> $_POST.find('input.name')
[12:47:44] <AoiC> lol.. server-side is not necessarily javascript
[12:48:05] <AoiC> so you would have to re-implement this in a lot of languages .. or send variables twice or more times with the same value-content
[12:48:34] <AoiC> nikio_ - why is the first selector without # ?
[12:52:59] <nikio_> AoiC, http://stackoverflow.com/a/323141
[12:53:09] <nikio_> it didnt wor with # either
[12:53:53] <tasaif> pauled: why are you using getelementsbyclassname?
[12:54:45] <pauled> I am mixing :)?
[12:55:12] <tasaif> … why?
[12:55:54] <pauled> I don't know really, just trying. I should use only jqery in that part ?
[12:56:08] <tasaif> I think so
[12:56:21] <tasaif> I never use getElementsByClassName
[12:57:56] <tasaif> pauled: are you trying to simulate a click?
[12:58:24] <pauled> I am totally newbie, I am just picking piece of code from google and stackoverflow
[12:58:30] <tasaif> oh
[12:58:47] <tasaif> what behavior are you trying to accomplish?
[12:59:15] <pauled> to simulate clic yes
[12:59:16] <pauled> http://fiddle.jshell.net/jakngzbj/2/
[13:01:49] <tasaif> how do you want to click?
[13:02:01] <tasaif> what's the logic?
[13:03:07] <pauled> ok, 1. when the game finished, I want to click "rematch", if they left, then click "New opponent"
[13:05:11] <pauled> in the current stat, the guy is left so the button Rematch are disabled
[13:05:28] <tasaif> and you want this to be done in javascript
[13:05:32] <tasaif> and not by the user?
[13:05:38] <pauled> yes
[13:05:58] <robmal> .onsuccess ( function () { $('blahblahrematch').click(); $('blahblahnewoponent'.click(); });
[13:06:18] <robmal> But that's a bad idea.
[13:06:32] <pauled> why
[13:06:33] <tasaif> this guys seems to be lacking some js fundamentals
[13:06:47] <robmal> You souldn't use js to do this.
[13:07:14] <pauled> you mean not js but jquery is ok?
[13:07:34] <pauled> or not automatically at all?
[13:07:43] <robmal> No, i mean it's a bad idea to use client-side scripts for this.
[13:08:00] <pauled> but there is another way?
[13:08:09] <robmal> Yes, restart the game server-side?
[13:08:42] <pauled> server don't provide a feature to auto rematch
[13:08:59] <Jake_> I currently have a jstree which is returning both success and an error for my call. I have it returning an empty array list as JSON which makes it into both success and error handling
[13:11:02] <tasaif> pauled: http://fiddle.jshell.net/jakngzbj/3/
[13:12:44] <pauled> tasaif: wow that look very smart :) thanks a lot I will try
[13:13:28] <tasaif> np
[13:14:30] <tasaif> Jake_: what do you mean?
[13:15:42] <Jake_> are you familiar with jsTree?
[13:15:48] <tasaif> mildly
[13:16:12] <tasaif> I haven't touched it in a really long time
[13:16:14] <robertmaxrees> btw be careful naming things "new" :)
[13:16:46] <tasaif> I like to live on the edge
[13:16:59] <robertmaxrees> also, instead of doing $($buttons.get(1));, just use .eq instead.
[13:17:05] <robertmaxrees> $buttons.eq(1);
[13:17:14] <tasaif> does eq give a jquery object?
[13:17:18] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/eq/
[13:17:19] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:17:25] <tasaif> I knew there had to be something
[13:17:49] <tasaif> I was initially using array notation, then I thought get might give the jq object
[13:18:21] <Jake_> its a jquery plugin that I am currently passing a null to. There is handling for success and errors and for some reason, with one call, I am getting both
[13:18:22] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:18:54] <tasaif> you're not passing the function with parenthesis are you?
[13:19:26] <tasaif> because that will execute the callback instead of passing it
[13:20:36] <Jake_> its an ajax call so its just returning what i have from a groovy controller based on the url i have setup in the function
[13:20:55] <tasaif> can you show me your js?
[13:21:18] <tasaif> http://www.hastebin.com/
[13:21:31] <robertmaxrees> fyi there's also !paste
[13:21:37] <tasaif> !paste
[13:21:45] <tasaif> ?
[13:21:48] <robertmaxrees> bad bot.
[13:21:56] <Jake_> yeah one sec
[13:21:58] <robertmaxrees> it's supposed to tell you the preferred paste services.
[13:22:09] <tasaif> !roll
[13:22:09] <aquaone> tasaif syntax: "!dice: <# of dice>d<# of sides>" e. g. "!dice: 2d20"
[13:22:25] <tasaif> !dice 2d
[13:22:26] <aquaone> tasaif syntax: "!dice: <# of dice>d<# of sides>" e. g. "!dice: 2d20"
[13:22:31] <robertmaxrees> woah another bot
[13:22:40] <tasaif> that's a really old one
[13:22:47] <tasaif> I think it was originally used for roleplaying
[13:22:56] <tasaif> !dice 2
[13:22:56] <aquaone> tasaif syntax: "!dice: <# of dice>d<# of sides>" e. g. "!dice: 2d20"
[13:23:04] <tasaif> !dice 2d20
[13:23:04] <aquaone> tasaif rolled 2d20 [2,8] = 10
[13:23:06] <robertmaxrees> "another bot" as in "another one in this channel"
[13:23:35] <tasaif> or maybe just the !paste script is botched?
[13:23:44] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:23:46] <robertmaxrees> b-ot is the bot.
[13:23:51] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery api docs
[13:23:52] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: No matches.
[13:23:56] <robertmaxrees> well well now.
[13:24:05] <robertmaxrees> so b-ot works, just no paste.
[13:24:05] <Jake_> http://www.hastebin.com/itapaxoloj.coffee  but i took out the urls btw
[13:24:26] <tasaif> weird
[13:24:51] <Jake_> both success and error are logging to the console
[13:25:41] <robertmaxrees> are you sure it isn't running twice?
[13:28:01] <Jake_> yeah its only going once
[13:28:54] <tasaif> I'm looking at http://www.jstree.com/api/ and I'm not seeing ajax in the way you're using it
[13:29:22] <tasaif> are you using a different document as reference?
[13:30:02] <robertmaxrees> Jake_ try something like http://fixee.org/paste/1kj73f5/ and see how many times you see "hit" in the console.
[13:32:39] <nikio__> plz help me with this
[13:32:42] <nikio__> $("bom").ready(function () {
[13:32:42] <nikio__> 	$('#bom').contents().find('.dg').hide();
[13:32:42] <nikio__> });
[13:32:45] <Jake_> I'll have to come back to the issue, gotta run fellas. <tasaif> I am modeling off another call used in the project that works that i saw
[13:32:57] <robertmaxrees> nikio__ please don't paste multiple lines in the channel.
[13:32:59] <nikio__> it doesnt work.. but when i manually type $('#bom').contents().find('.dg').hide(); it works
[13:33:10] <tasaif> Jake_: cya gl
[13:33:12] <robertmaxrees> and  $("bom").ready(function () { isn't valid -
[13:33:15] <nikio__> that means the frame bom isnt fully loaded
[13:33:22] <pauled> tasaif: doesn't seems to work. we can try it in live if you want http://lichess.org/YLgZSu8s
[13:33:25] <Jake_> <tasaif> ty
[13:33:43] <robertmaxrees> nikio__ https://api.jquery.com/ready/
[13:33:49] <robertmaxrees> you can't use ready on any random element.
[13:33:58] <robertmaxrees> it's only valid on the document.
[13:33:59] <nikio__> robertmaxrees, i am using it on a frame
[13:34:29] <tasaif> pauled: I think you should watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMxGhHNOkCU so you can resolve the issue on your own
[13:34:33] <robertmaxrees> then you need to target the contents of the iframe and bind there.
[13:34:51] <robertmaxrees> though that might not work - i haven't see that work before.
[13:34:58] <pauled> tasaif: ok :p thanks :)
[13:35:05] <tasaif> np :)
[13:35:10] <robertmaxrees> there's also http://learn.jquery.com
[13:35:48] <tasaif> pauled: ^
[13:37:02] <nikio__> cant get it to work i guess ; /
[13:38:17] <tasaif> nikio__: maybe something like hits? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11088057/bind-to-events-inside-dynamically-created-iframe
[13:38:49] <pauled> but it's difficult for me, I have not learned English at school. And I'm not really coder. This is just to make a user script once.
[13:39:37] <tasaif> nikio__: is bom the id? if so, the selector would be $('#bom
[13:40:39] <nikio__> tasaif, its the name of the frame
[13:41:36] <tasaif> then I think the selector would be $("[name='bom']")
[13:42:01] <tasaif> $("bom") is looking for a bom tab (e.g.: <bom></bom>)
[13:43:10] <tasaif> robertmaxrees: does there not exist a learning page in spanish?
[13:43:32] <tasaif> pauled: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery?locale_code=es
[13:45:01] <pauled> tasaif: nice site :)
[13:45:18] <pauled> bookmarked
[13:45:39] <tasaif> I think if you go through those exercises, then you will have no problem trying to solve your problem
[13:45:56] <pauled> I hope :)
[13:46:14] <tasaif> http://learn.yo.mind.jpg.to
[13:47:29] <nikio__> tasaif, why does this happen?
[13:47:43] <tasaif> why does what happen?
[13:48:04] <tasaif> you mean why does $('bom') look for a bom tag?
[13:55:48] <pauled> tasaif: can be a problem if the <a> doesn't have href?
[13:56:13] <tasaif> no
[13:56:26] <pauled> I mean for .clic
[13:56:31] <tasaif> no
[13:56:56] <tasaif> pauled: click fires something called an 'event' on the 'a' dom object
[13:57:23] <tasaif> if there is no href on the 'a' then there is probably something called a listener that's bound on the dom object
[13:57:36] <tasaif> the listener waits for the 'click' event to fire on the object, then executes its code
[13:59:20] <pauled> I guess my goal with that userscript is too hight for my knowledge
[14:04:08] <tasaif> yes, I think so
[14:04:26] <tasaif> but I think you can do it after you complete those exercises
[14:08:30] <pauled> Thanks tasaif. I must go to sleep. Good evening to you.
[14:25:18] <tasaif> good evening to you too
[15:19:27] <karma> Hello! i am working on site that uses jquery.tablesorter plugin. Somehow it mutates html table to be sortable and paginates its contents. I am still newbie (but learning) at jquery/jscript, I wonder how can I get original content (full table) of element that Tablesorter was applied to. Any hints by any chance?
[15:20:49] <randomguy1> I would imagine if you wanted to access something like that you would need to store a copy.
[15:22:14] <tasaif> karma: why do you want the original contents?
[15:22:21] <tasaif> what are you trying to do?
[15:25:05] <karma> Well, I am working on greasemonkey script. Basically I am writing scripts that is calculating some statistics, so I need full data (full table, not one page), but 'tablesorter' mutates it so I can't find full table in DOM. Given that client side script, full table must be there somewhere as tablesorter thing lists pages and such.
[15:25:31] <karma> Just looking for hints where to look at.
[15:26:32] <tasaif> I'm not seeing anything obvious on their docs
[15:26:37] <tasaif> have you checked their source code?
[15:27:30] <karma> Yeah, found nothing in docs. Just unminified code used on website, trying to look it up. My js/jquery knowledges are still pretty limited, so going to take some time :)
[15:28:39] <tasaif> you're insane
[15:28:43] <tasaif> https://github.com/christianbach/tablesorter/blob/master/jquery.tablesorter.js
[15:29:33] <karma> hehe, i just was not sure what version they use, so i decided to unminify code but that works too :)
[15:31:12] <tasaif> table.tBodies
[15:31:15] <tasaif> ??
[15:33:42] <randomguy1> nifty, just learned about $.one...
[15:35:47] <karma> tasaif, hm.. as i am using greasemonkey, there is another question.. i am running my script as external one on window load event, if i know that this table is tablesorter one, how can i get original object so i can get access to tBodies? really not sure if you understand my question though :)
[15:37:45] <tasaif> I don't know greasemonkey, but after looking at Tablesorter it seems you can only access them one page at a time
[15:38:01] <tasaif> still looking though
[15:38:28] <karma> tasaif, thank you for your time, appreciated a lot
[15:41:16] <tasaif> karma: $('#tablesorter-demo').get(0).tBodies[1]
[15:41:19] <tasaif> does that work?
[15:41:41] <karma> tasaif, let me check
[15:41:52] <tasaif> the index of tBodies is the page number
[15:42:37] <tasaif> do you have a multipage example of the library?
[15:44:43] <karma> tasaif, it gives me 'undefined' but that can be greasemonkey issue.. by example, do you mean instance of table that tablesorter was applied to?
[15:45:25] <tasaif> I think I was wrong about tBodies
[15:45:59] <tasaif> I mean, can you send me a link of a table that uses tablesorter so I can play with it?
[15:46:11] <tasaif> ideally in a fiddle
[15:48:02] <karma> tasaif, i wish i could, but that is part of big website, i am just using firebug to dig through it..
[15:50:21] <tasaif> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[15:50:48] <tasaif> you don't necessarily need the identical thing in the website
[15:50:58] <tasaif> just duplicate the idea
[15:54:19] <karma> tasaif, http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=3jd6HQ69 <-- will this work?
[15:57:57] <tasaif> nope, I require an interactive sample because I am a pleb
[16:43:36] <AcidRain2012> how can i make sure a form is validated before using a link to submit it?
[16:43:47] <robertmaxrees> how are you validating it?
[16:43:48] <AcidRain2012> like the optional required
[16:44:20] <AcidRain2012> just that it meets the criteria.
[16:44:32] <robertmaxrees> i'd suggest using a validator for that.
[16:44:34] <robertmaxrees> like jquery validate.
[16:44:43] <AcidRain2012> damn i knew u would say that
[16:44:53] <robertmaxrees> it'll be as hard as building your own :)
[16:44:57] <randomguy1> o.O
[16:45:15] <AcidRain2012> lol. im just talkinga bout making a link act perfectly as if it were a submit button
[16:45:22] <robertmaxrees> that's each.
[16:45:24] <robertmaxrees> *easy
[16:45:24] <AcidRain2012> its alrdy built in. just asking how to use it from a link
[16:45:45] <robertmaxrees> $('a').on('click', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $theForm.trigger('submit'); });
[16:46:14] <AcidRain2012> i alrdy doing this in the onclick
[16:46:15] <AcidRain2012> document.createProject.submit();
[16:46:20] <AcidRain2012> does not work as a submit button
[16:46:25] <robertmaxrees> don't use onClick
[16:46:30] <AcidRain2012> but its the same thing?
[16:46:34] <robertmaxrees> it's hacky.
[16:46:40] <robertmaxrees> there's a reason we moved to .on()
[16:46:48] <robertmaxrees> and addEventListener
[16:47:24] <randomguy1> and it's nice to segregate your js and html, :D
[16:47:29] <robertmaxrees> that too.
[16:47:33] <AcidRain2012> but doing it in jquery like you have demonstrated would emulate a submit click?
[16:47:34] <robertmaxrees> that's why we moved to those things.
[16:47:41] <AcidRain2012> not a link haxt to use a submit
[16:47:45] <AcidRain2012> cause its different outcomes
[16:47:47] <robertmaxrees> no...
[16:47:54] <robertmaxrees> $('a').on('click', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $theForm.trigger('submit'); }); would submit the form.
[16:48:00] <robertmaxrees> .on('click' binds a click even listener.
[16:48:05] <robertmaxrees> the callback does the rest.
[16:48:57] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to update $theForm to an actual reference obviouslyt.
[16:49:41] <AcidRain2012> k thx. ill check this out later
[16:49:45] <AcidRain2012> i forgot why i needed this
[16:50:14] <randomguy1> this discussion made me think of something.  is there a reason why people use a href="#" and cancel the event instead of using a href="javascrip:;" ?
[16:50:39] <robertmaxrees> randomguy1 because href="javascript;" breaks the separations of concern.
[16:50:47] <robertmaxrees> the html shouldn't know about the logic.
[16:50:52] <robertmaxrees> let the logic handle that.
[16:51:13] <randomguy1> i get that, but if your trying to just create a dead link, seems minor
[16:51:30] <robertmaxrees> then why not just use onclick=?
[16:51:34] <robertmaxrees> for small stuff?  seems minor.
[16:51:34] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:51:51] <robertmaxrees> don't put logic in your markup.  that's all.
[16:51:58] <randomguy1> i agree
[16:58:18] <tasaif> dude what
[16:58:32] <tasaif> you don't care that the link was clicked, you care that the form was submitted
[16:58:45] <tasaif> you should overload the submit and do your validation there
[16:59:15] <randomguy1> can you make a submit or button look like a link?  may be a stylistic consideration.  *shrug*
[16:59:15] <robertmaxrees> then where did the whole thing about the link to submit it come from?
[16:59:29] <robertmaxrees> clarification would be nice, either way.
[17:05:20] <randomguy1> anyway, i'm gonna go watch some tube.  l8r all

[17:25:48] <Matix> Hey guys!
[17:26:01] <Matix> How do you scroll a div with scrollbars to the very bottom of it?
[17:26:25] <robertmaxrees> no lie, set the scrollTop() to its height./
[17:26:27] <Matix> I tried a couple of ways I found on the internet but none of them work well when the browser screen is not completely maximized
[17:26:44] <Matix> robertmaxrees, that was the first thing I did, doesn't work ^
[17:27:05] <robertmaxrees> sure it does.
[17:27:08] <robertmaxrees> you may have been doing it wrong.
[17:27:10] <robertmaxrees> one se.c
[17:27:42] <_blizzy_> hello. I'm trying to get a data attribute from a dropped item, however, I can't seem to get it.
[17:27:44] <_blizzy_> https://gist.github.com/NotBlizzard/46487f6d1da5f9e149e5
[17:28:42] <robertmaxrees> Matix http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/33osav5g/
[17:30:43] <Matix> robbyoconnor, you're fixing the height, that's why it works. my div with scrollabrs gets resized if it doesn't fit on the browser
[17:30:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:30:57] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle,t hen.
[17:31:00] <Matix> give me a sec, I'll create one
[17:31:07] <robertmaxrees> you're basically stating a problem and expecting us to know all the parameters around it ;)
[17:31:21] <Matix> no, I was creating a jsfiddle, I didn't have one :P
[17:34:36] <Matix> robertmaxrees, http://jsfiddle.net/zzqz3jhy/19/
[17:34:53] <Matix> green box
[17:37:19] <robertmaxrees> your issue is that the green box's height isnt short enough to cause the scroll.
[17:37:45] <robertmaxrees> as far as i can tell.
[17:39:18] <Matix> short enought to cause the scroll? I'm not sure what you mean robertmaxrees
[17:40:04] <robertmaxrees> you're going to say "this isn't what i want" but i'm just illustrating: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zzqz3jhy/20/
[17:40:11] <robertmaxrees> you can't overflow table cells iirc.
[17:40:20] <robertmaxrees> *scoll them i mean.
[17:40:22] <Matix> this isn't what I want!
[17:40:24] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:40:25] <mrtAkdeniz> hey there
[17:40:27] <Matix> one sec, I didn't see it :P
[17:40:40] <mrtAkdeniz> I've a div, and I want to show this div before go to link.
[17:40:56] <mrtAkdeniz> I found confirm dialogs, but I want to use my modal div
[17:40:58] <mrtAkdeniz> Any ideas?
[17:41:09] <robertmaxrees> Matix it's because .second is 100% of the height of page, which fix all of the content.
[17:41:28] <robertmaxrees> you're hiding the overflow, but there's nothing to scroll.  the fiddle explains it better than i can.
[17:43:46] <Matix> robertmaxrees, I think I got what you mean, but in this case what would make the div to scroll?
[17:44:16] <robertmaxrees> i have to get back to work, but search for ways to make that div the same height as the viewport.
[17:44:26] <mrtAkdeniz> Nobody knows?
[17:44:44] <Matix> robertmaxrees, I will, thanks
[17:44:57] <Matix> if anybody else want to give his opinion, it's more than welcome!
[17:45:00] <robertmaxrees> mrtAkdeniz open the modal on click?
[17:45:08] <mrtAkdeniz> nope robertmaxrees
[17:45:11] <robertmaxrees> mrtAkdeniz you're not giving us much to work with.
[17:45:16] <mrtAkdeniz> Need to show 1 sec
[17:46:15] <mrtAkdeniz> I've something like that robertmaxrees http://pastie.org/10164742
[17:46:35] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[17:46:47] <robertmaxrees> then use a modal library and use this as the modal.
[17:46:50] <mrtAkdeniz> I'm showing that with data-toggle="modal" data-target="#confirmModal"
[17:46:56] <mrtAkdeniz> with <a>
[17:47:01] <_blizzy_> hello. I'm trying to get a data attribute from a dropped item, however, I can't seem to get it.
[17:47:04] <_blizzy_> https://gist.github.com/NotBlizzard/46487f6d1da5f9e149e5
[17:47:11] <mrtAkdeniz> but problem is, i'm using php and I need to redirect to non-static page
[17:47:25] <mrtAkdeniz> I mean, I'm using loop, and this link need to change every time
[17:47:33] <mrtAkdeniz> so I want to use a confirm box on clicked link
[17:47:46] <mrtAkdeniz> and If i click ok, go to link location
[17:47:52] <mrtAkdeniz> if cancel, go back
[17:48:02] <mrtAkdeniz> there are some dialog confirms on web
[17:48:04] <robertmaxrees> _blizzy_ you want $(this).data('nick') iirc.
[17:48:15] <mrtAkdeniz> like jquery confirm dialog
[17:48:20] <mrtAkdeniz> but I want to show this div
[17:48:22] <mrtAkdeniz> not confirm dialog
[17:48:40] <robertmaxrees> mrtAkdeniz you can usually usually customize the html for the modal.
[17:48:47] <robertmaxrees> you can build all this out pretty easily.
[17:49:11] <mrtAkdeniz> In brief, i want to show this modal before opening link
[17:49:17] <mrtAkdeniz> yes, I'm editing modal with html
[17:49:27] <mrtAkdeniz> but jquery dialogs is javascript
[17:49:29] <robertmaxrees> use something like jqModal and show the modal on clicking the link.
[17:49:45] <mrtAkdeniz> i mean, there is only title and description
[17:49:45] <robertmaxrees> you can usually target a block of html to use as the modal's markup.
[17:50:01] <mrtAkdeniz> robertmaxrees, i think you misunderstood me
[17:50:09] <mrtAkdeniz> forget everything please
[17:50:12] <robertmaxrees> you want to show a custom div instead of a default modal?
[17:50:24] <mrtAkdeniz> assume that there is a link : <a href=google>
[17:50:33] <_blizzy_> robertmaxrees, I'm still getting undefined. c:
[17:51:01] <robertmaxrees> _blizzy_ what about $(ui.draggable).data('nick') ?
[17:51:07] <mrtAkdeniz> and when i clicked this link, there will be a modal, and if i click first button, i'll be redirected to google, if i click cancel, i'll be stay on my page
[17:51:09] <mrtAkdeniz> you got me?
[17:51:19] <mrtAkdeniz> like confirm dialog, but not confirm dialog :c
[17:51:32] <robertmaxrees> mrtAkdeniz a confirm dialogue is just a modeal.
[17:51:33] <robertmaxrees> *modal
[17:51:44] <robertmaxrees> it had two buttons - one goes to the link, the other closes the modal.
[17:51:55] <mrtAkdeniz> yes
[17:51:56] <_blizzy_> that worked. thank you, robertmaxrees
[17:52:01] <robertmaxrees> _blizzy_ deffo
[17:52:08] <robertmaxrees> mrtAkdeniz right.  that's really simple.  check out jqmodal.
[17:52:16] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to wire that all up yourself, but it's pretty trivial to do.
[17:53:32] <mrtAkdeniz> robertmaxrees, they are not what i want...
[17:53:43] <robertmaxrees> that's exactly what you want.
[17:53:51] <robertmaxrees> you want a modal whose content you can define.
[17:54:00] <robertmaxrees> you want buttons within that modal to have custom behavior.
[17:54:02] <mrtAkdeniz> yes but i've modal
[17:54:20] <robertmaxrees> does the modal currently launch the way you want it to?
[17:54:25] <robertmaxrees> does it display the way you want?
[17:54:29] <mrtAkdeniz> yes
[17:54:43] <mrtAkdeniz> all i want to do is, when i clicked ok on this modal
[17:54:45] <robertmaxrees> so you click the link and the modal currently displays?
[17:54:47] <mrtAkdeniz> go to a href's location
[17:54:52] <mrtAkdeniz> yes
[17:55:25] <mrtAkdeniz> i mean, copy a href's value, and redirect to this value when i clicked one button
[17:55:46] <mrtAkdeniz> you can tell me what to search, i'm so newbie on jquery, that's why i'm here :)
[17:55:48] <robertmaxrees> then in the click event binding for the link, grab the href and on click of the button, window.location.href = whateverhtelinkis
[17:55:59] <mrtAkdeniz> yeees
[17:57:47] <mrtAkdeniz> robertmaxrees, did you tell me what to do, or you just figured out what is my problem?
[17:57:54] <robertmaxrees> i just told you.
[17:57:57] <mrtAkdeniz> lol
[17:58:15] <robertmaxrees> if you need more help, setup a fiddle.
[18:03:02] <mrtAkdeniz> robertmaxrees, is that ok?
[18:03:03] <mrtAkdeniz> https://jsfiddle.net/mrtakdeniz/qyxxp6fc/
[18:04:46] <mrtAkdeniz> robertmaxrees, as you see, there is a blue button on modal
[18:04:50] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qyxxp6fc/1/
[18:04:52] <robertmaxrees> easy
[18:05:01] <robertmaxrees> err https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qyxxp6fc/2/
[18:05:02] <robertmaxrees> there.
[18:05:24] <robertmaxrees> not perfect - i'd override the bootstrap event bindings with my own to manually control things, but meh.
[18:06:07] <mrtAkdeniz> lol robertmaxrees
[18:06:12] <mrtAkdeniz> it is not not perfect
[18:06:15] <mrtAkdeniz> it is awesome :)
[18:06:46] <mrtAkdeniz> this is what i understand -> grab a's href, and use it on modal's href
[18:06:48] <mrtAkdeniz> right?
[18:07:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah, but that doesn't work because bootstrap is doing some weird stuff witht he button's events.
[18:07:15] <robertmaxrees> in fact, things aren't updating the way they should.
[18:07:23] <mrtAkdeniz> let me try it robertmaxrees
[18:07:41] <robertmaxrees> you'll probably have to manuyally build + fire the modal instead.
[18:10:37] <mrtAkdeniz> robertmaxrees, it worked :3
[18:10:41] <mrtAkdeniz> thank you so much
[18:10:41] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[18:11:08] <robertmaxrees> sure
[18:11:19] <robertmaxrees> that's sort of hamfisted fwiw
[18:13:20] <mrtAkdeniz> lol robertmaxrees it failed now :P
[18:13:24] <robertmaxrees> told ya
[18:13:28] <mrtAkdeniz> it is now getting href page as modal
[18:13:34] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:13:42] <mrtAkdeniz> i mean, if my href google.com
[18:13:52] <mrtAkdeniz> it is getting google.com as modal
[18:13:58] <mrtAkdeniz> wanna screenshot?
[18:14:08] <robertmaxrees> you mean it's loading google.com into the modal?
[18:14:20] <mrtAkdeniz> yeah kind of robertmaxrees
[18:14:26] <mrtAkdeniz> not modal, but like modal
[18:14:30] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:14:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:14:38] <robertmaxrees> you're confused.
[18:14:52] <mrtAkdeniz> so much..
[18:15:07] <robertmaxrees> a "modal" is just the window that gets overlayed on the page.
[18:15:16] <robertmaxrees> the content is irrelevant.
[18:15:25] <mrtAkdeniz> oh not white thing?
[18:15:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:15:34] <robertmaxrees> screenshot.
[18:15:35] <mrtAkdeniz> so it is loading target page as modal :3
[18:16:41] <mrtAkdeniz> robertmaxrees, http://imgur.com/2NVEL8j
[18:17:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's loading the page into the modal.
[18:17:23] <mrtAkdeniz> so, should i trigger modal with myself?
[18:17:27] <mrtAkdeniz> not with bootstrap?
[18:17:46] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to manually build the modal before launching it.
[18:17:55] <robertmaxrees> part of that will involve manually triggering it.
[18:18:12] <mrtAkdeniz> what you mean with manually build?
[18:18:21] <robertmaxrees> use javascript to write out the html for the modal.
[18:18:40] <mrtAkdeniz> can i use hide and show div?
[18:18:47] <robertmaxrees> *modal, not div.
[18:19:02] <mrtAkdeniz> my modal is not a div? :\
[18:19:15] <robertmaxrees> it is, but you're hiding and showing the modal.
[18:19:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:19:25] <mrtAkdeniz> lol
[18:19:31] <mrtAkdeniz> i mean, can i use show and hide modal div?
[18:19:33] <robertmaxrees> if i remember correctly, bootstrap's modal setup is a little awkward and clones the contents of the modal on pageload, so you'll need to manually build it back out for each one.
[18:19:47] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to manually hide and show it,
[18:20:33] <mrtAkdeniz> $("#myModal").show("slow");
[18:20:35] <mrtAkdeniz> like that?
[18:20:37] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:20:44] <robertmaxrees> you need to rebuild and re-init the modal.
[18:20:53] <robertmaxrees> though i'm fuzzy on bootstrap's details.
[18:20:57] <mrtAkdeniz> really have no idea what build means
[18:21:11] <robertmaxrees> write out the html using javascript to change the url on that button.
[18:22:18] <robertmaxrees> at this point, i'd go to #bootstrap and describe what you want to them.
[18:22:21] <robertmaxrees> they might be able to help better.
[18:22:33] <mrtAkdeniz> oh thank you robertmaxrees
[18:26:20] <mrtAkdeniz> robertmaxrees, it works with google.com
[18:26:36] <mrtAkdeniz> but if i change link with php, it going to screw up again
[18:26:58] <robertmaxrees> sounds like bootstrap is trying to ajax the content in.
[18:27:01] <robertmaxrees> search their docs.
[18:28:44] <mrtAkdeniz> robertmaxrees, what if i use button instead of a
[18:28:59] <robertmaxrees> then you'll need to do a custom event binding.
[18:33:00] <mrtAkdeniz> robertmaxrees, is data-blabla tags for bootstrap ?
[18:33:09] <mrtAkdeniz> should i go bootstrap channel for that?
[18:33:41] <robertmaxrees> data-* attributes are apart of html5.
[18:34:04] <mrtAkdeniz> i think i can fix it by give "<a href="#" data-link="blabla">"
[18:34:14] <mrtAkdeniz> and copy data-link into model's href?
[18:34:26] <robertmaxrees> no clue.
[18:34:37] <mrtAkdeniz> ok let me try
[18:35:31] <mrtAkdeniz> lol, i fixed robertmaxrees :)
[18:35:36] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[18:35:37] <mrtAkdeniz> thank you so so so much
