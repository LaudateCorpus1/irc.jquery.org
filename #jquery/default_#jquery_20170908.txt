[04:48:59] <hellyeah-overdoe> canvas doesnt get along with jquery right?
[04:49:12] <Cork> sure it does
[04:49:21] <Cork> though you can't move things inside it with jquery core
[04:49:24] <Cork> cause it isn't elements
[04:49:45] <hellyeah-overdoe> humm
[04:50:41] <hellyeah-overdoe> so you can select canvas element
[04:50:49] <Cork> sure
[04:50:52] <hellyeah-overdoe> but you cannot move things inside canvas with jquery
[04:50:56] <hellyeah-overdoe> is it correct?
[04:51:04] <Cork> you can't do anything inside them at all
[04:51:20] <Cork> think of canvas as an img tag from the point of view of jquery core
[04:51:36] <Cork> you can resize the canvas element but that is about it
[04:54:01] <hellyeah-overdoe> resizing is about canvas element
[04:54:03] <hellyeah-overdoe> i am sure
[04:54:10] <hellyeah-overdoe> you can do it inline or from css
[06:23:41] <undefined_bob> hey Cork you having yummy lunch right now?
[08:22:26] <undefined_bob> re
[08:25:57] <undefined_bob> Cork: are you there?
[08:31:56] <Cork> undefined_bob: if you have a question just ask it, else ppl will have to ask you what your question is
[08:33:31] <undefined_bob> oh yes I know but I wanted to ask you if you have the link of the menu, you set up last time, once again for me?
[08:33:53] <Cork> check http://irc.jquery.com
[08:34:00] <Cork> cause no i didn't save the link
[08:34:31] <undefined_bob> nice, thank you
[08:37:45] <trigcode> i downloaded an admin template from a web site and the jquery.min is 1.6.3
[08:38:32] <trigcode> it functions, but i'm almost certain that the version being so old, must have some improvements
[08:39:08] <Cork> the entire event optimization was done after it
[08:39:23] <Cork> (1.7+)
[08:39:28] <trigcode> wow
[08:39:34] <trigcode> so it's useless basically
[08:39:50] <Cork> that would be a grose overstatement
[08:40:16] <Cork> but ya, if possible i would check how complicated it would be to update to a modern version
[08:40:42] <Cork> 1.6 is still in the old .live() days so it can be quite a bit
[08:41:21] <Cork> if it is written correctly it should use .delegate back then
[08:41:30] <Cork> and then the upgrade shouldn't be that hard
[08:41:31] <trigcode> yeah, i'm thumbing through the sources and there are a lot of changes
[08:41:45] <Cork> but if it used the then old .live() (but still supported) solution then... fun
[08:42:14] <trigcode> the php version used was from 2010
[08:42:15] <trigcode> heh
[08:42:25] <Cork> the biggest change except for the .live would be the removal of some of the .toggle() features for example
[08:42:41] <trigcode> yeah
[08:42:43] <Cork> oh, and the split of attr into attr and prop
[08:42:51] <trigcode> it's going to be a nightmare
[08:42:56] <Cork> the later is prob the biggest thing you would have to modify
[08:43:28] <Cork> there are jquery-migrate you might want to use it to find the problems
[08:43:39] <trigcode> ok
[08:44:29] <Cork> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate
[08:44:34] <trigcode> thanks
[08:44:41] <Cork> though i'm not sure if migrate goes all the way back to 1.6...
[08:49:23] <trigcode> i think i need to upgrade to 1.9* first, then npm the latest
[08:49:30] <trigcode> if i'm reading it correctly
[08:52:07] <Cork> trigcode: not really https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/tree/1.4.1
[08:52:14] <Cork> you want an older version of the lib
[08:52:36] <Cork> but i'm not sure if it goes as far back as 1.6
[08:52:47] <Cork> i know it works for 1.7 to 1.9
[08:53:03] <Cork> but i think it also handles 1.5 or even 1.4, not sure
[08:57:10] <trigcode> i'm about to find out
[09:04:28] <trigcode> NOTE: If you have not yet upgraded to 1.12.x or 2.2.x, first upgrade to them and use jQuery Migrate 1.x to resolve any compatibility issues before using jQuery Migrate 3.0 and upgrading to jQuery 3.0.
[09:04:44] <trigcode> that part went smooth
[09:04:59] <trigcode> so now i'm going to try going to 3
[09:09:01] <Cork> note, you might not want to go to 3, 2 and 3 has no old ie support
[09:11:21] <trigcode> the browsers in use for this are the latest version of chrome
[09:11:35] <trigcode> i don't need to worry about IE issues thank god
[09:12:16] <Cork> then you most likely want to move to 3 ya
[09:12:39] <Cork> but ppl sometimes think 1.x is old just cause 3 is bigger then 1
[09:12:58] <Cork> but those are separate branches for different compatibilities
[09:26:01] <undefined_bob> puh, it looks good at codepen but when I copy the code to my site it didnt work anymore
[09:38:17] <undefined_bob> have a nice weekend :)
[09:38:18] <undefined_bob> bye
[09:47:35] <trigcode> got it working, thanks cork
[09:49:00] <Cork> np, i just linked you did all the work :)
[09:49:12] <trigcode> i have a virtualbox image of windows 10; i might see if it works with IE just for fun
[10:39:46] <jak2001> hi all
[10:42:15] <jak2001> i have 10 buttons, (each button have 10 parameters) of course 1,2, differents.... my question is in each button click event need something: $("#btn1").click(function () { var wpar1 = $("#wpar1").val(); var wpar2 = $("#wpar2").val(); and so on? .... ?
[10:42:30] <jak2001> 10 lines by button for get the value of inputs/selects?
[10:50:43] <jak2020> dissconnected, i have 10 buttons, (each button have 10 parameters) of course 1,2, differents.... my question is in each button click event need something: $("#btn1").click(function () { var wpar1 = $("#wpar1").val(); var wpar2 = $("#wpar2").val(); and so on? .... ? 10 lines by button for get the value of inputs/selects?
[11:07:11] <poboy> question.  If I want to have an alert popup on submit, what do I change here?  $('#attachmentWebViewable').submit().append( $( "<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">...</div>") );
[11:11:04] <poboy> heh.  single quotes!
[11:31:40] <poboy> Now the question is how do I just fade out the append instead of the whole id?
[11:31:47] <poboy> $('#attachmentWebViewable').submit().append( $( '<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"></div>') ).fadeOut("slow");
[11:42:53] <taplar> break the statement up
[11:43:20] <taplar> store the div in a variable, append the variable, then fade the div afterwards
[11:47:31] <poboy> taplar, I have this https://jsfiddle.net/3s9nf8a0/1/  but the fadeout is not working
[11:48:29] <taplar> o.O
[11:49:21] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/3s9nf8a0/2/
[11:54:14] <poboy> thanks
[12:56:30] <plamb> is there a method on array where i can divide an array by a filter?
[12:56:49] <robertmaxrees> "divide"?
[12:56:49] <plamb> i.e. put the items that match the filter in one array and the items filtered out into another array
[12:57:03] <plamb> or do i need to run filter twice
[12:57:08] <taplar> you could reduce them into an object
[12:57:19] <taplar> which the keys inside being the divisions
[12:58:03] <plamb> so say I want to split this json object by the type attribute
[12:58:05] <plamb> https://jsfiddle.net/plamb/fsrko4y8/
[12:58:18] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce
[12:58:21] <robertmaxrees> plamb let's flip the question.
[12:58:40] <robertmaxrees> what's the significance of "type" in this case?
[12:58:52] <robertmaxrees> ie would it make more sense to have your backend pump it out as two arrays?
[12:59:26] <plamb> well i could build to separate JSON structures i guess
[12:59:30] <plamb> two*
[12:59:38] <robertmaxrees> these all look like server instances so type is just an attribute.
[12:59:41] <robertmaxrees> that sound about right?
[12:59:45] <plamb> yeah
[12:59:50] <robertmaxrees> then i'd leave it as one.
[12:59:57] <robertmaxrees> so why do you want two arrays out of this one?
[13:00:21] <plamb> i need to split my "recommended instances" between memory-intensive instances and compute-intensive instances
[13:00:47] <plamb> wanted to use filter on type, but keep the filtered out elements in their own array
[13:00:50] <robertmaxrees> imo i'd make two functions - each should return what you're looking for.
[13:00:51] <plamb> since there are only two types
[13:01:46] <plamb> yeah i could just map over the JSON structure twice and get two arrays, i just wondered if there was a different way because it seemed like it might be more performant
[13:02:13] <robertmaxrees> no need for that tho.
[13:02:59] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/fsrko4y8/1/
[13:03:05] <robertmaxrees> just do something basic like this.
[13:03:38] <plamb> fair enough
[13:03:48] <plamb> it is only like a 6 element array :)
[13:04:38] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/fsrko4y8/2/  <-- here's a reduce to separate
[13:05:54] <plamb> interesting
[13:07:19] <plamb> is the , []); at the end the initial value
[13:07:26] <plamb> err , {})
[13:07:28] <taplar> yes
[13:09:52] <jak2020> dissconnected, i have 10 buttons, (each button have 10 parameters) of course 1,2, differents.... my question is in each button click event need something: $("#btn1").click(function () { var wpar1 = $("#wpar1").val(); var wpar2 = $("#wpar2").val(); and so on? .... ? 10 lines by button for get the value of inputs/selects?
[13:10:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:10:20] <robertmaxrees> fiddle?
[13:11:08] <grapheti> Speak English doc, we ain't scientists!
[13:12:37] <taplar> i believe he's asking how to make it better, than reapeating the same logic 10 times for each button.  which a fiddle will help us see his markup to make suggestions
[13:12:50] <grapheti> ^
[13:13:27] <taplar> that was at you dude, :P
[13:13:38] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[13:13:50] <grapheti> haha, I was just jokingj
[13:13:53] <grapheti> joking*
[13:13:54] <robertmaxrees> jak2020 we're gonna need to see a fiddle homeskillet.
[13:14:18] <grapheti> show us your fiddle!
[13:14:29] <jak2020> ok
[13:16:11] <grapheti> dem utility functions
[13:30:36] * taplar twiddles thumbs
[13:33:33] * grapheti checks phone
[13:35:22] <plamb> taplar, what is this line doing in the reduce
[13:35:24] <plamb> if ( result[ element.type ] === undefined ) result[ element.type ] = [];
[13:35:34] <taplar> the element starts out empty
[13:35:46] <taplar> it's putting the key in there with an empty array if it hasn't been created yet
[13:36:11] <plamb> ah okay
[13:44:53] <plamb> tfw you put your code thats not working into fiddle and it works
[13:45:01] <plamb> must have a misspelling somewhere
[13:45:29] <robertmaxrees> got a console error?
[13:45:59] <plamb> an array is returning "undefined" after going through a function
[13:46:31] <plamb> essentially this: https://jsfiddle.net/plamb/fsrko4y8/3/
[13:46:33] <plamb> but its working here
[13:47:23] <plamb> sorry, this: https://jsfiddle.net/plamb/fsrko4y8/4/
[13:48:05] <plamb> whats strange is that
[13:48:33] <plamb> in the fiddle, one elem of the array looks like this
[13:48:34] <plamb> {name: "m4.xlarge", clusterSize: 13, hourlyPrice: "3.11", totalRam: 208, type: "memory"}
[13:48:44] <plamb> in my program it looks like this
[13:48:46] <plamb> {name: "m4.xlarge", clusterSize: 9, hourlyPrice: "2.15", totalRam: 144, totalCores: 36, …}
[13:48:55] <taplar> hourlyPrice isn't in that array afaics
[13:49:02] <taplar> price is
[13:49:02] <plamb> that ellipsis
[13:49:11] <plamb> oh i changed it taplar in the fiddle
[13:49:22] <taplar> not in /4
[13:49:24] <plamb> why would that ellipsis be there in the console.log print out?
[13:49:37] <robertmaxrees> because there are more props in the obvject.
[13:49:45] <plamb> so its just eliding the extra ones
[13:50:20] <taplar> also price is already a number in /4
[13:50:29] <robertmaxrees> if you click the object in your console you should be able to expand it and see those props.
[13:50:33] <plamb> ah yeah, if i add the totalCores calc it does it in the fiddle too
[13:53:18] <plamb> am i missing something obvious in this chunk of code
[13:53:20] <plamb> https://pastebin.com/7p09RVMk
[13:53:49] <plamb> its coming out undefined after running through that
[13:54:11] <taplar> what is that method returning?
[13:54:26] <plamb> supposedly a sorted array of objects
[13:54:30] <taplar> is it?
[13:54:58] <plamb> when its abstracted into its own function like that do i need to return a new array of objects?
[13:55:11] <taplar> how would a function return if not for a return statement?
[13:55:26] <taplar> this isn't groovy, :)
[13:56:31] <robertmaxrees> well.
[13:56:49] <taplar> i know, technically it returns something
[13:56:49] <robertmaxrees> so sort updates in place.
[13:57:00] <taplar> but not the last thing you do implicitly
[13:58:12] <robertmaxrees> but yeah.
[14:33:02] <jajaja> how can i find the previous element of selected element?
[14:33:28] <taplar> 'previous element'?
[14:34:08] <jajaja> element before current element, few elements before
[14:34:13] <grapheti> https://api.jquery.com/prev/ ?
[14:34:30] <taplar> in the dom, in the selection chain, what?  'before' can mean different things
[14:35:03] <jajaja> it's not directly previous but few elements before, its first h3 element before current element
[14:35:17] <taplar> so, a previous sibling?
[14:35:38] <jajaja> no not sibling, a complezx structure
[14:35:42] <taplar> lol
[14:35:47] <taplar> make a fiddle...
[14:36:08] <grapheti> you must be psychic taplar
[14:36:10] <grapheti> use the force
[14:36:21] <jajaja> but it's the first h3 elemente before current a element
[14:36:33] <taplar> that doesn't tell me anything about your dom structure
[14:36:42] <taplar> and jQuery is used to find things in the dom
[14:36:52] <taplar> so how it's structured, for what you are asking, is super important
[14:37:08] <jajaja> let me see if i can paste
[14:38:02] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/tree-traversal/  <-- there are various traversal methods available
[14:40:35] <jajaja> can i paste here or pastebin?
[14:40:48] <robertmaxrees> use a paste service pls :)
[14:40:48] <taplar> pastebin please
[14:40:57] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle is even better.
[14:43:36] <jajaja> https://pastebin.com/qca5Y3MX
[14:47:59] <jajaja> do u see it?
[14:52:26] <taplar> yeah.  from the element you are going up to the parent, back to a sibling, and down to a child
[14:56:21] <taplar> this is probably going to be harder than it should be, cause you have broken markup
[14:57:02] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^
[14:58:45] <grapheti> dat markup smelly, visit https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input sometime
[14:59:15] <taplar> just doing it step by step, prev() fails to work after a point because of the bad markup.  you need to address that
[14:59:23] <poboy> bad markup because of the missing /a?
[15:00:13] <taplar> in the least, close your <h5>
[15:00:16] <robertmaxrees> poboy because this has an li as a child of <h5>
[15:00:27] <robertmaxrees> which will break a ton of other stuff.
[15:01:06] <poboy> ah
[15:01:15] <taplar> or does the h5 close some where after what you pasted?
[15:05:21] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter tho - the browser's gonna have a heckuva time trying to figure out how to parse that.
[15:05:56] <taplar> i got it to work with the h5 being after the fact
[15:06:30] <taplar> really wish they had a shared parent though
[15:06:50] <robertmaxrees> different browsers might have issues tho :)
[15:07:08] <taplar> true
[15:10:10] <grapheti> I like jajaja feel asleep.
[15:12:40] <robertmaxrees> it happens
[15:14:02] <grapheti> lol
[15:17:21] <jajaja> well i got it on my own
[15:17:36] <jajaja> find did the trick
[15:19:12] <jajaja> the prop("tagName") is also very useful to find out "where u are" at first place ;)
[15:26:04] <jajaja> hmm u can't have li's inside h5?
[15:26:32] <taplar> technically li's should be children of ul or ol
[15:26:41] <jajaja> they are
[15:26:45] <taplar> directly
[15:27:01] <jajaja> but also some are chldren of h5
[15:27:06] <taplar> no
[15:27:13] <taplar> only li are valid children of ul or ol
[15:27:25] <jajaja> perhaps i should use strong instead of h5
[15:27:34] <jajaja> was just quicker to type
[15:27:58] <taplar> stylesheets are even quicker
[15:28:19] <jajaja> yes, well thats minor issue
[15:28:44] <jajaja> anyway got it working
[15:33:47] <grapheti> lol
[15:34:24] <robertmaxrees> welp
[15:59:45] <verax5> Can someone tell me how I can reach the '.comment_form' class form the 'show_comment_form' class that's at the bottom?
[15:59:46] <verax5> https://kopy.io/VVy7s#GplO9nXJHG4BHN
[16:00:17] <verax5> Tries something like this but doesnt work
[16:00:18] <verax5> $(this).prevAll('comment_form')
[16:00:35] <verax5> Keeps getting me: Object { 0: <a.show_comment_form>, 1: <a.show_comment_form>, 2: <a.show_comment_form>
[16:00:50] <robertmaxrees> .closest('.comment_wrapper').find('.comment_form')
[16:03:11] <verax5> Hm not quite working robertmaxrees
[16:03:14] <verax5> $('.show_comment_form').click(function(){  console.log($(this).closest('.comment_wrapper').find('.comment_form')); });
[16:03:25] <verax5> Object { 0: <a.show_comment_form>, 1: <a.show_comment_form>, 2: <a.show_comment_form>, 3: <a.show_comment_form>, 4: <a.show_comment_form>, length: 5, prevObject: Object[1] }
[16:06:29] <verax5> not sure what i could be doing wrong
[16:07:48] <robertmaxrees> can you show the rendered html?
[16:07:52] <robertmaxrees> instead of the template
[16:13:40] <taplar> that object doesn't match your find(), unless that class is also on those same elements
[16:15:12] <verax5> robertmaxrees: https://kopy.io/pkNRj#T46VUz2RVN7Heu
[16:15:27] <verax5> i just cant understand how it can be so hard..
[16:16:47] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/unhxw320/
[16:17:49] <verax5> taplar:
[16:17:54] <verax5> like i wanna have them all hide
[16:18:02] <verax5> then when user clicks on reply, show that particular
[16:18:10] <verax5> but just tryna understand what im doing wrong
[16:18:52] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/unhxw320/1/
[16:19:00] <robertmaxrees> not sure where the disconnect is.
[16:19:02] <robertmaxrees> works fien.
[16:19:03] <robertmaxrees> *fine
[16:20:01] <robertmaxrees> so that does that fiddle do wrong?
[16:20:12] <verax5> oh nah
[16:20:15] <verax5> fiddle works fine
[16:22:32] <verax5> but this:
[16:22:33] <verax5> $('.show_comment_form').click(function(){  $(this).closest('.comment_replies'); });
[16:22:55] <verax5> gives me this:
[16:22:55] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:22:55] <verax5> Object { 0: <a.show_comment_form>, 1: <a.show_comment_form>, 2: <a.show_comment_form>, 3: <a.show_comment_form>, 4: <a.show_comment_form>, length: 5, prevObject: Object[1] }
[16:23:08] <verax5> i expected it to get me comment_replies div
[16:23:36] <robertmaxrees> sounds like your markup is busted.
[16:24:19] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/unhxw320/2/
[16:24:21] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[16:24:41] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[16:24:49] <taplar> the replies are not in the form
[16:24:51] <robertmaxrees> your markup between the fiddle and the page must be different.
[16:24:55] <taplar> that lookup returning the form doesn't make sense
[16:25:19] <robertmaxrees> ^ something is janky here.
[16:26:49] <verax5> https://kopy.io/SiTMX#4U4TPIuNi4AgYM
[16:26:56] <verax5> its a disgrace i know..
[16:27:59] <verax5> this is disgusting
[16:28:05] <verax5> gota figure out why html is messy
[16:28:05] <robertmaxrees> still working fine tho.
[16:29:52] <verax5> hmm
[16:29:53] <verax5> yeee
[16:29:55] <verax5> it works xd
[16:30:02] <verax5> i gota figure why lol
[16:30:08] <taplar> why it works?
[16:30:41] <verax5> $('.show_comment_form').click(function(){  $(this).closest('.comment_wrapper').find('.comment_form'); });
[16:30:47] <verax5> when i put this in console
[16:30:54] <verax5> i see this:
[16:30:55] <verax5> Object { 0: <a.show_comment_form>, 1: <a.show_comment_form>, 2: <a.show_comment_form>, 3: <a.show_comment_form>, 4: <a.show_comment_form>, length: 5, prevObject: Object[1] }
[16:30:58] <verax5> even tho it works
[16:31:00] <taplar> cause that's the selector
[16:31:03] <robertmaxrees> ^ heh
[16:31:10] <taplar> you left out telling us you were putting it in the console
[16:31:12] <robertmaxrees> the console is printing out the return of the method call.
[16:31:15] <taplar> that's pertinent(sp) info
[16:31:19] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[16:31:26] <verax5> taplar: i mean i was just testing lol
[16:31:31] <taplar> dude
[16:31:34] <taplar> lol
[16:31:35] <verax5> well fuck
[16:31:36] <robertmaxrees> still relevant.
[16:31:41] <robertmaxrees> you want that.
[16:31:50] <robertmaxrees> that's all the elements .on() is attaching to, basically.
[16:32:03] <verax5> so what do i do next time i decide to use console to try 'debugging' shit lol?
[16:32:12] <taplar> tell us what you are doing
[16:32:19] <taplar> 'i'm sticking this in the console and seeing .... '
[16:32:24] <robertmaxrees> depends on what you're debugging.
[16:32:40] <taplar> vs, 'i put this in my code and i'm seeing .....
[16:33:07] <robertmaxrees> also: clarify what you're trying to debug.
[16:33:30] <taplar> and if you REALLY want to debug, http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[16:33:34] <verax5> robertmaxrees: well technically nothing, just trying to get shit working lol
[16:33:42] <robertmaxrees> erm
[16:33:46] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:34:02] <verax5> taplar: sorry i thought browser interpresed both the same way
[16:34:06] <verax5> interpreted
[16:34:16] <robertmaxrees> so in the future, it's way relevant to say "when i paste this in my console i get x, but when i click the elements i get y - what's the difference?"
[16:34:18] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[16:34:32] <verax5> robertBusy: got it man thanks
[16:35:13] <verax5> thank you taplar
[16:37:08] <poboy> taplar, good resource, thanks!
[16:37:15] <taplar> np
[16:37:21] <taplar> debug like a baller, ;)
[16:38:04] <verax5> jquery is confusing
[16:38:31] <taplar> some basic things to keep in mind
[16:38:44] <taplar> if you can make a css selector, it will most likely work in jquery
[16:39:03] <taplar> $().someMethod() will usually return the $() it operated upon afterwards, unless it functions as a getter
[16:39:12] <taplar> like val() or prop('key'), etc
[16:41:24] <verax5> thanks man
[16:41:26] <verax5> noted!
[16:46:36] <verax5> another weird one
[16:47:30] <verax5> https://kopy.io/IfKBK#QpDTZoEXWGLX5G
[16:48:01] <verax5> taplar:  I select parent, then I select the next but still cant get to 'comment_form' class
[16:48:19] <taplar> are comment_forms siblings?
[16:49:04] <taplar> wait, hold on
[16:49:12] <verax5> Yes taplar as you can see 'show_comment_form' class is sibling to 'comment_form'
[16:49:37] <taplar> there's only one comment_form in a group of comment_form_wrapper
[16:51:08] <taplar> nvm, comment_form is a child of the comment_replies in that paste
[16:54:47] <taplar> so see the problem?
[16:56:09] <verax5> oh
[16:56:12] <verax5> should i use .child()
[16:56:14] <verax5> lemme try
[16:56:28] <taplar> find()
[16:56:59] <taplar> when possible try to use closest/find over parent/children as it provided a looser coupling approach to the lookup
[16:58:04] <verax5> ah
[16:58:06] <verax5> that worked :D
[16:58:18] <verax5> wait it's opening two comment forms when i click the first 'reply' button lol
[16:58:26] <verax5> other reply links work fine opening only one form
[16:58:28] <verax5> weird
[16:58:40] <taplar> the find is most likely finding both
[16:59:12] <verax5> but when, for instance i click the 3rd 'reply' link, it only opens one form
[16:59:19] <verax5> does that indicate broken html
[16:59:25] <taplar> is there only one form in that grouping?
[16:59:57] <taplar> it's all based off of the forms in that comment_replies element
[17:00:01] <taplar> with the logic you had
[17:00:45] <taplar> which with the markup you have you could just roll with $(this).prev().show()  or $(this).prev('.comment_form').show()
[17:00:55] <taplar> since your links is immediately after the form
[17:03:36] <verax5> one sec
[17:03:46] <verax5> .. lemme sure out why the heck my markup is fked up..
[17:03:48] <verax5> cant even read..
[17:05:03] <taplar> are you doing any sort of cleansing of the comments on the server side?
[17:05:27] <verax5> taplar: ye kinda just escaping tags and stuff
[17:05:39] <taplar> k
[17:05:48] <verax5> in laravel we got some {{ $var }} that takes care of it
[17:06:28] <verax5> taplar: you were right..
[17:06:30] <verax5> 2 forms..
[17:06:43] <verax5> in comment_replies class
[17:06:49] <verax5> tag
[17:08:41] <taplar> i feel like you should probably adjust this a little
[17:09:05] <taplar> "comment_wrapper" being where it is kinda doesn't make sense.  it's really a "post_wrapper" if anything as that's what you are foreaching
[17:09:33] <taplar> then you could make a <span class="comment_wrapper"> for the markup inside the nested foreach
[17:09:51] <taplar> and that would let you use the closest('.comment_wrapper') to target the associated form for a link
[17:10:02] <taplar> and objectively would make more sense
[17:10:42] <taplar> brb
[17:13:06] <taplar> b
[17:14:28] <catbadger> hey all
[17:14:56] <catbadger> that feeling when you're putting off your lunch break but you're STARVING
[17:15:00] <catbadger> lol
[17:15:25] <taplar> i skipped lunch today as i wanted to watch some game playthroughs
[17:16:35] <taplar> go crazy on some water.  you'll be fine, :)
[17:16:40] <catbadger> yesss
[17:16:46] <catbadger> i'm going in 10 mins
[17:17:07] <taplar> to the restroom?  tmi man
[17:17:49] <catbadger> haha no for lunch. it's almost 2:30 here that means i'll have an hour left when i get back from my 30 min break
[17:18:16] <catbadger> sooo it's theory time...
[17:19:13] <catbadger> Is this the best way to do this? $('.a').parents('.b');
[17:19:40] <catbadger> or is there a faster way that I'm missing?
[17:19:41] <taplar> to get the direct 'b' parents of the 'a's?  sure
[17:20:01] <catbadger> it doesn't have to be direct
[17:20:08] <taplar> oh true
[17:20:11] <catbadger> I'm actually travelling to the container element.
[17:20:19] <catbadger> several levels up in the dom
[17:20:25] <taplar> i read it as 'parent'
[17:20:32] <catbadger> :)
[17:21:27] <taplar> you could always do $('.b').filter(function(){ return $(this).find('.a').length; });
[17:21:34] <taplar> not sure if it'd be faster.  would be more calls
[17:21:48] <taplar> but the 'b' subset may be smaller than the 'a' subset
[17:23:04] <taplar> first is probably faster, given less calls and less jquery overhead
[17:23:30] <catbadger> hmm i'll need to test both in my case. thank you
[17:23:48] <taplar> though speed wise we are talking small amounts
[17:24:02] <taplar> so i kinda want to say you're probably over optimizing at that point
[17:25:20] <catbadger> likely. it's for a big system, so even small optimizations can make a difference
[17:25:22] <catbadger> :)
[17:25:35] <robertBusy> size of the system is irrelevant.
[17:25:41] <robertBusy> number of calls is.
[17:29:33] <catbadger> true. I had just noticed that in a couple cases whgere the dom is big, my way is a little slow.
[17:29:53] <catbadger> thanks again guys. lunchtime!!!
[17:40:21] <taplar> what command are you doing that is showing slowness?
[17:41:09] <taplar> $('.class') should be short circuiting to getElementsByClassName or querySelectorAll, which on it's own should be very fast
[17:43:30] <taplar> he gone.
