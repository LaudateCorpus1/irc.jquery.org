[00:00:04] <wa5ted> HowardwLo: try a fixed div
[00:00:08] <wa5ted> fixed hieght div
[00:00:11] <wa5ted> contianing the images
[00:00:16] <wa5ted> and then set that to bottom: 0;
[00:00:28] <wa5ted> still confusd of intended behaviou
[00:03:11] <HowardwLo> wa5ted: ya thats what i ended up doing
[00:03:36] <HowardwLo> basically i want to make this http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/12/  work for   http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/13/
[00:03:52] <HowardwLo> images that are smaller than window size
[00:04:35] <wa5ted> HowardwLo:  this is a dirty hack but use the scroll event
[00:04:36] <HowardwLo> i ended up putting my functions inside another if, to check if the images are bigger than screen. i geuss it works ok
[00:04:44] <wa5ted> to set the vertical offset of the image
[00:05:08] <wa5ted> and then use an if statement to make sure that it does scroll beyond the window parameters
[00:06:49] <HowardwLo> wa5ted: sorry im pretty new with jQ, scroll event listener?
[00:07:01] <HowardwLo> so as you’re scrolling, the image....scrols?
[00:07:11] <wa5ted> ? scroll
[00:07:16] <wa5ted> damn bot
[00:07:19] <wa5ted> can never use him
[00:07:35] <wa5ted> HowardwLo: http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[00:08:18] <HowardwLo> that method sounds complicated
[00:08:28] <HowardwLo> how do i make sure the image is within view?

[04:33:36] <Crucials> I'm using a plugin that also changes some classes and shiz. I want to fire a certain event when a class has changed - can I somehow check for that, or will I have to edit the plugin itself?
[04:34:27] <iDevelop> Crucials: is there a callback maybe?
[04:34:52] <Crucials> iDevelop: nothing I can find, and its all minified so I can't actually make out much in it
[04:35:05] <iDevelop> Is there documentation?
[04:37:35] <Crucials> yeah but nothing that will help me, as far as I can tell
[04:44:05] <Crucials> iDevelop: basically I'm just trying to change some css of a parent element to the element that the class was added to
[04:44:28] <Crucials> but I have no callback and as far as I understand changing class doesnt trigger any events
[04:45:05] <iDevelop> I'm not sure then
[04:45:17] <iDevelop> Sorry :/ I'm not great with Javascript stuff
[05:55:00] <OnkelTem> Hi all
[05:56:26] <OnkelTem> I have two jQuery objects, say - $a and $b. Is there a way to join them into array of objects to apply jQuery function to both like for example $(questFunction([$a, $b])).css(...)?
[05:57:09] <OnkelTem> Ah, isn't it extend
[06:19:17] <fas3r> is it possible to put the row of the table as a selector ? like : $(table tr???) if you have a idea please. thank you
[06:19:35] <shafox> How can I create this html with jquery http://pastie.org/9247184 ?
[06:32:23] <fenris_kcf> hy. how can i make .ajax send my cookies?
[06:40:54] <bumbar> when i submit form with .submit() method, i get (canceled) status, in chrome inspector, and have no idea how to debug it
[07:10:45] <biffco> hi
[07:11:36] <biffco> how could i convert in $.ajax the data sent as serialized array to json...should i convert it to json array?
[07:21:02] <Technodrome> hey , i have a form, i want to make enter (submit) goto my callback the button goes to, but enter still submits the form as a normal post
[07:37:49] <jop008> what is a good way to handle float on an input field?
[08:07:39] <funhouse> Hey there, using ajax for some reason when I do a post, it sends application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8, I don't want the charset sent, is this a webserver issue?
[08:11:51] <funhouse> I add  contentType : 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', but it's still sending charset
[08:21:27] <funhouse> Anyone?
[08:22:07] <Technodrome> how can i make jquery execute the onclick method on a form submit via return?
[08:23:03] <fenris_kcf> Technodrome: what do you mean with "via return"?
[08:23:14] <Technodrome> like hitting enter submits my form
[08:23:22] <fenris_kcf> ah
[08:23:27] <Technodrome> but if i click my form submit , it does an onclick
[08:23:37] <Technodrome> onclick is the desired way for this
[08:23:44] <tandroid> use .submit() instead of click
[08:24:03] <fenris_kcf> you could bind 'keyup' and look up the keycode
[08:24:03] <Technodrome> well actually its a multi step form
[08:24:25] <Technodrome> so the first 3 onclicks are not the real submit, the last one that would be ok
[08:25:13] <funhouse> Technodrome: trigger?
[08:28:27] <Technodrome> well maybe funhouse , i’m not sure
[08:29:39] <funhouse> Anyone know how to stop sending charset header with ajax? "application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8"
[08:34:45] <shoky> funhouse: you can set contentType option to whatever you want with $.ajax
[08:36:38] <funhouse> shoky: I did that already
[08:36:47] <funhouse> shoky: contentType : 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded;',
[08:37:24] <funhouse> Still sending Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8;
[08:37:31] <shoky> funhouse: works fine for me http://jsfiddle.net/A5FaB/
[08:37:41] <funhouse> shoky: weird.
[08:42:07] <funhouse> shoky: looks liks its a FF issue
[09:13:20] <krambiorix> hi, how can i disable an autocomplete option ?

[09:18:28] <krambiorix> fenris_kcf, with renderItem, i give them a class
[09:34:40] <shoky> krambiorix: give them class ui-state-disabled

[11:03:35] <puchacz> hmmm, when sending in $.post data like "l": [1, 2, 3], the parameter was renamed to "l[]"

[11:10:21] <jorvis> I'm trying a version of the demo jquery.ajax() call, with a simple python script which just returns JSON data.  The 'failure' event fires every time and then the JSON data is just displayed in the browser.  What am I missing here?  http://pastie.org/9247903
[11:13:14] <jorvis> Oh, it was only because I didn't have 'return false;' at the end of my function.
[11:17:27] <Vivekananda> anyone here who has a little patience with an inane question
[11:17:59] <beancurd> just ask dude
[11:19:19] <Vivekananda>  I just want to learn how to look at firebug better. in this case I want to know how to figure out what chart making library is being used in that PARTICUlar case  in    http://wrapbootstrap.com/preview/WB0573SK0   in the chart which is live and big  at the top
[11:21:22] <beancurd> http://omnipotent.net/jquery.sparkline/#s-about
[11:22:39] <beancurd> http://bootstraphunter.com/jarvisadmin/basic_charts.html
[11:22:54] <Vivekananda> beancurd: much rather than getting an answer I would love to know how to figure it out for my self so I can use the method in future. Also I am not sure if sparklines are being used for THAT particular chart
[11:23:21] <beancurd> flot?
[11:24:08] <beancurd> http://www.flotcharts.org/
[11:24:32] <beancurd> im just loojing at src
[11:25:19] <Vivekananda> I am talking about the chart titled : 'auto updating chart' in  here  http://i.imgur.com/cCLODSS.png . I usually just fire up firebug and click on the node and some class name/ css element  usually gives me the library being used but I cannot see that for this particular chart
[11:26:49] <Vivekananda> beancurd: but currently firebug just gives this : http://i.imgur.com/D8DxRIc.png
[11:59:57] <Technodrome> i want to bind a button to do an ajax request before it post to the page, if i bind it normally will it always execute the ajax request before the post?
[13:18:27] <hxm> hi
[13:18:31] <hxm> exists a way to avoid this? Refused to display 'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authenticate?oauth_token=dJ0EJ0mWKAcUTrbWc4waxDSR9BI0W9gnXg54mRaNQ' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'SAMEORIGIN'.
[13:25:14] <Blaster> Hi everyone
[13:25:34] <Blaster> Can you help me debug this menu I'm trying to create?  What's the best way to do this?  The main problem is the delay when opening?  http://jsfiddle.net/zW53e/1/
[13:26:25] <Blaster> And I was wondering if there was a better way to handle the close functionality (when clicking on something other than the menu?)
[13:30:15] <Blaster> Okay I've got the open menu functionality down, but what's the best way to close the menu when you click outside of it? http://jsfiddle.net/6bTLe/

[15:04:14] <JSM87> Hey guys. I have some jquery that changes the order of 3 divs. This works, however, for a split second as the page is loaded you can physically see the first column just before jquery moves it elsewhere. It looks really bad. I need jquery to do its thing before the user sees the output really. What ways can be used to rectify this?
[15:08:17] <beancurd> JSM87: display none on the divs, then .show() in your jquer
[15:08:19] <beancurd> y
[15:08:31] <beancurd> after stuff gets moved.
[15:09:16] <JSM87> beancurd: I'm aware of that method but I disaprove as if the user does not have javascript enabled it will never be shown. Also, some bots for seo etc may not like that. I was hoping there was another way around this?
[15:09:35] <Jisan> Hello
[15:09:39] <Jisan> need a bit of help
[15:09:44] <beancurd> noscript styleshets to show that stuff.

[15:48:48] <HowardwLo> howdy!
[15:50:13] <HowardwLo> I’m serving content to my page randomly, Item A, item F, item O etc… I’m using history api to make it look slick with ajax requests and pushState() to change the url. How do i know which was the previous url when they do a browser back with popstate ?
[16:40:06] <areckx> I'm trying to get the innerHTML to write _before_ the <footer> tag, but it is writing at the very bottom of the body. http://jsbin.com/rawejika/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[17:41:41] <uskerine> Does anybody know how to make 'datatables' row selectable? So the user is presented with a table and when he or she clicks in a row the row Id is returned and certain action happens. It is for prompting the user with a whole table items and let him/her select one.
[17:42:33] <Hyperking> hello, when we make http requests for json data, what kind of security should be done to protect from malicious attacks?
[17:44:10] <uskerine> hyperking: user authenticated and authorized for that servie and potentially -depending on data exchanged- usage of https?
[17:44:16] <uskerine> service*
[17:46:16] <frank_o> uskerine <3
[17:46:27] <frank_o> https all day !!
[17:47:29] <uskerine> that might be a bit overkilling in certain situations
[17:47:54] <uskerine> maybe you want to share your JSON with NSA
[17:47:57] <frank_o> yep
[17:48:02] <frank_o> haha
[17:48:15] <frank_o> yeah i hear that's quite trendy nowadays
[17:48:41] <frank_o> im using unique tokens atm.. considering https
[17:49:00] <Hyperking> if im looking to use json for small sites as a flat file db and angularjs to serve the pages. not sure if having an ssl is needed
[17:49:37] <uskerine> ssl is only needed if you fear man-in-the-middle attacks or eavesdropping
[17:50:28] <uskerine> it depends on what you move back and forth in your JSON service
[17:50:40] <Hyperking> my major concern is for someone adding bad data to my json
[17:50:54] <uskerine> you mean your actual users?
[17:51:30] <uskerine> then SSL is not helping at all, that's for third bad guys on the wire
[17:51:33] <Hyperking> no, anyone want to do something malicious
[17:51:44] <Hyperking> wanting*
[17:52:32] <uskerine> maybe you have to validate all JSON fields on your service
[17:52:40] <Hyperking> im not a security guru, I love JSON and javascript...just taking precautions
[17:52:40] <uskerine> and ensure that they are properly formatted
[17:53:16] <uskerine> you can: ensure that user has been authenticated and authorized (that's the most basic security)
[17:53:28] <uskerine> adding SSL if you think that someone in the middle might tamper or eavesdrop
[17:53:54] <uskerine> and additionally, your service should performe some validation on the JSON data and format
[17:54:17] <Hyperking> my sites would not have members. mainly blogs and static sites
[17:54:35] <uskerine> then you can just validate on the server side, as your  service will be exposed
[17:55:44] <Hyperking> right, thats my concern! what would i be validating server side? and any ideas on implementing a safeguard?
[17:55:47] <uskerine> so if you are expecting fields "foo" and "mainlyFoo", check that JSON object has those fields, and do all the validations needed. Thats, AFAIK what you can do
[17:56:39] <uskerine> I think that's very application dependant. But number of fields, type, lenght, avoiding certain characters that might pose SQL injection risk, etc.
[17:59:50] <uskerine> Check the left sidebar, there are a certain number of common web vulnerabilities, hope that might help you. https://www.golemtechnologies.com/articles/data-security-and-json
[17:59:58] <uskerine> sorry, right sidebar
[18:01:16] <Hyperking> uskerine: thanks, could i protect the file to only be read by its domain?
[18:01:49] <uskerine> which file?
[18:02:20] <frank_o> I got this Selectize (fancy select) here: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Dnscf/3/ -- but why won't it change from `Choose option` to `Search...` on click?
[18:27:26] <RSAutos> hey guys how would I obtain a value of a certain div which has been replicated multiple times?
[18:28:21] <RSAutos> anyone on?
[18:28:39] <shoky> what's a value of a div?
[18:28:57] <beancurd> count?
[18:29:09] <shoky> what do you want to get...
[18:29:16] <beancurd> THE VALUE
[18:29:23] <beancurd> in dollars.
[18:29:25] <RSAutos> no so lets say I have 3 headers
[18:29:26] <shoky> oh you're someone else k
[18:29:33] <beancurd> haha.
[18:29:55] <RSAutos> and I want to check whether you go passed any of them and if you do then get the value of the one you just went pased
[18:29:56] <RSAutos> passed*
[18:30:02] <RSAutos> passed as in scrolled passed it
[18:30:48] <beancurd> wut.. your original question contained none of the things you just mentioned.
[18:30:50] <beancurd> haha.
[18:31:03] <shoky> except "the value"
[18:31:11] <RSAutos> if I think you're missunderstanding me xD
[18:31:19] <RSAutos> so I have 3 content divs
[18:31:25] <RSAutos> each of them have a header
[18:31:39] <RSAutos> when I scroll passed one of them I want to obtain their value
[18:31:58] <RSAutos> or content
[18:32:01] <shoky> you can listen for the scroll event on the window object
[18:32:05] <shoky> and do some math
[18:32:10] <RSAutos> I got that part
[18:32:13] <shoky> or find some plugin to do it for you
[18:32:18] <RSAutos> wut
[18:32:23] <RSAutos> no lolz
[18:32:34] <shoky> .text() gets an element's text
[18:32:52] <RSAutos> so on window scroll check whether the scroll position is greater then or equal to the header
[18:33:35] <shoky> which part are you having a problem with
[18:34:04] <RSAutos> http://pastebin.com/z0xr1r1S
[18:34:21] <RSAutos> so here I assign div content to the header you just went passed
[18:34:34] <RSAutos> but the issue is that there are multiple headers in the same order
[18:35:12] <shoky> .each() loops over elements
[18:35:32] <RSAutos> so how would I apply that?
[18:35:59] <RSAutos> just right after assign the div content?
[18:36:03] <shoky> $(selector).each(function() { ... })
[18:36:09] <RSAutos> aah
[18:37:11] <shoky> and btw you're re-setting the text on EACH scroll event
[18:37:26] <RSAutos> what would be a better way of doing this?
[18:41:05] <RSAutos> http://5.175.138.115/
[18:41:13] <RSAutos> so there is the site that I'm trying to build
[18:41:20] <RSAutos> ignore the css and the re-occursion
[18:41:26] <RSAutos> I know how to manage that part
[18:41:40] <RSAutos> but if you scroll you can see what's changing
[18:43:50] <RSAutos> shoky, Could you have a look at the issue plz
[19:41:18] <areckx> ok, I am trying to figure out how to make it so that the cards are assigned a random image  based on some sort of href="#rowx_y" tag,  and when clicked will load the image (doing a flip animation to be added after functionality) but I am having trouble finding what to do http://jsbin.com/saxewuvo/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[19:45:16] <areckx> am I even on the right track? how do I know if I should try another route? this is the hardest part for me in programming, I can follow a book, and so far I have done this without even looking at a tutorial, but when I get stuck I don't know if I'm even going about it the right way
[19:53:08] <areckx> ?
[19:56:45] <tbmiller> @areckx try this as a starter http://jsbin.com/paxexuzi/1/edit
[20:02:40] <areckx> tbmiller: ok so how can I load the array into that random slice?
[20:21:08] <{DV8}> Does anyone know if it's possible to link to specific text on an external page using jQuery?  (like an anchor tag, except there's no anchor)
[20:23:19] <tbmiller> @arechx try building a html structure that gets the output as an array, put it on the page and sort it from there. Just as a random guess for testing
[20:32:28] <Vivekananda> ih everyone
[20:39:11] <beancurd> hai
[20:44:23] <Vivekananda> beancurd: howdy . I asked you the bootstrap question earlier today didnt I ?
[20:45:21] <beancurd> um.... was it about the charts?
[20:45:33] <beancurd> i was having breakfast, then i stepped out.
[20:45:45] <beancurd> but iirc. it was flot2 or something.
[20:48:43] <Fraz> hi
[20:49:10] <Fraz> is there any way to set an object property with a string instead of a name? self.$elem.transition({left: v, duration: 0 });
[20:49:26] <Fraz> i have left: as a string
[20:50:07] <Vivekananda> beancurd: yep but a naive question
[20:50:10] <Vivekananda> I was looking at one of the dashboards and had a very naive question. want to figure out how the elements such as tables , buttons etc given on the left can be included on the dashboard demo page. do I hve to buy it first to be able to include it in the demo  or  is there some way of including it in the demo page  without buying ? .  http://wrapbootstrap.com/preview/WB0573SK0
[20:50:29] <Vivekananda> I am trying to create a dashboard myself
[20:50:37] <Vivekananda> and hope to replicate the functionality of this one
[21:20:21] <beancurd> Vivekananda: yeah, plenty of dashboards out there to dissect.
[21:24:32] <Vivekananda> beancurd: did not get  you
[21:24:54] <Vivekananda> could you tell me something about that particular one especially the functionality question I posed above
[21:29:02] <Vivekananda> beancurd: ?
[21:47:54] <uskerine> hi, while var sData = oCatalogListTable.fnGetData( this );
[21:48:09] <uskerine> retrieves the whole row from a datatable, how could I extract just the first column?
[21:51:22] <duch_kazatel> uskerine is that an array it's returining?
[21:51:30] <duch_kazatel> try slapping a [0] after it.
[21:51:54] <uskerine> ok, i am trying that
[21:52:25] <uskerine> you are right
[21:52:36] <uskerine> (I am not sure what the heck I was looking for...)
[21:52:37] <uskerine> thanks
[21:52:52] <duch_kazatel> sometimes a named index or something ;)
[21:52:59] <duch_kazatel> but hopefully that gets you on your way.
[21:54:00] <uskerine> getting the first column is enough for this, so [0] works fine, it is a hidden column with the ID so I can identify the record
[21:54:35] <duch_kazatel> ah
[22:07:35] <uskerine> http://datatables.net/examples/api/add_row.html
[22:07:52] <uskerine> while trying that, I got $(...).row is undefined
[22:13:11] <phyrrus9> is anybody online atm?
[22:20:25] <uskerine> in case someone is interested .row is undefined is a bug, it is fixed if you use datatables 1.10
[22:43:17] <Junior> yello ;)
