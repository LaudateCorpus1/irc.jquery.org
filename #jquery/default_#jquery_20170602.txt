[07:19:07] <memi> hello. Anyone have a problem when jquery not request ajax after manual refresh page (F5)? And what more strange, when debug console active (F12) i am not show this problem.
[07:21:10] <Cork> memi: is this in internet explorer?
[07:21:44] <memi> chrome
[07:23:15] <memi> in some cases request executed when i open console after refresh
[07:25:57] <Cork> memi: never seen that happen at all
[07:26:19] <Cork> the reason i asked about ie is cause it in older versions didn't define console unless the console was open
[07:26:30] <Cork> so you got exception and the code after the exception didn't run cause of this
[07:26:38] <Cork> but chrome has never done this
[07:27:21] <Cork> memi: the only suggestion i can give you is to check what async calls your using and see if you have a raise cause of that
[08:14:34] <reynierpm> hi guys and good morning, can anyone help here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44328555/jquery-ajax-and-jquery-ui-dialog-uncaught-typeerror-illegal-invocation ?? I've been fighting with this for the last 4 hours without any solution :-(
[08:53:51] <useretail> hi, why when I log to console it works, but when i try to "return" it doesn't work: https://pastebin.com/A3F225Pn
[08:54:43] <Cork> useretail: you return into $.each you need to use $.map
[08:55:10] <Cork> also you can't add an array to a string like that
[08:55:30] <useretail> Cork, i need to .append()
[08:56:08] <Cork> useretail: https://jsfiddle.net/c12nv5mm/
[09:08:46] <useretail> Cork, thanks a lot buddy, it worked!
[09:10:41] <useretail> but why actually .each() acts differently than .map()
[09:12:19] <useretail> afaik .each() is a "for loop"
[09:13:18] <Cork> useretail: cause $.each loops over the elements, $.map is for looping over the elements and constructing an array of the return values from each itteration
[09:13:43] <Cork> meaning each doesn't return a collection of the results
[09:14:20] <Cork> useretail: think of it as $().append(for() {}) <-- this won't work either
[09:14:48] <useretail> hehe
[09:14:54] <useretail> god bless query
[09:15:01] <useretail> *jquery
[09:15:22] <useretail> real life saver
[10:27:06] <jcbdev> Seriously frustrating problem. I'm getting: $myDialog is not defined but it IS defined in an included js file as indicated here: https://pastebin.com/3SXtTmWL Obviously if I Include it in the bottom of the file itself it works fine but that defeats the purpose. Any pointers/suggestions as to what I'm missing?
[10:31:58] <taplar> jcbdev: looks like the variable is in a different scope
[10:32:44] <taplar> $myDialog is var scoped to the doc ready in the dialog.js
[10:43:48] <Mayor30> hi friends, how can i stop setInterval? clearInterval dsnt work. https://jsfiddle.net/ww1haLam/ i need restart counter each button click.
[10:44:21] <taplar> scope the progress higher
[10:44:40] <taplar> you have it scoped to the event handler.  it will be lost when the next handler executes
[10:45:30] <Mayor30> taplar: i have no idea (scope the progress higher) =\
[10:46:27] <Mayor30> taplar: can you edit my jsfiddle? please
[10:47:20] <Mayor30> wow :(
[11:01:13] <taplar> sorry my browser went stupid
[11:01:28] <taplar> Mayor30: variables that have 'var' in front of them inside a function are scoped to that function.
[11:01:37] <taplar> move the var progress part outside of the binding
[11:05:01] <Mayor30> taplar: omg! thanks!!!
[11:14:00] <jcbdev> taplar: How to I fix it?
[11:14:51] <jcbdev> taplar: I'm not quite as versed in jquery as I am with php :/
[11:16:33] <jcbdev> taplar: What/how SHOULD $myDialog be scoped?
[11:20:20] <taplar> i think the scope is probably fine.  however i'm not sure you are ever attaching it to the page
[11:21:23] <taplar> the included file should probably append that element to the page at some point, and then the other one can look it up
[11:21:34] <taplar> so you can avoid making a global variable
[11:24:15] <jcbdev> taplar: Hmmm, not exactly sure how to accomplish that seeing as it is all declared as a var...and, iiuc, including a js file doesn't quite work the same as including a php file. Since including a php file makes everything in it avail to the including file as though they're one big file...
[11:24:40] <jcbdev> Frustrating...
[11:24:41] <taplar> the DOM is shared by all javascript
[11:24:55] <taplar> when you append things to it, other parts of javascript can find those elements
[11:25:25] <jcbdev> So how to I "append" that var then - correctly, since it isn't atm
[11:26:02] <jcbdev> * do I
[11:27:58] <jcbdev> A more updated paste: https://pastebin.com/kjvX79L8
[11:28:14] <jcbdev> Er...sort of :P
[11:29:25] <jcbdev> taplar: I hate having to ask these questions...I'm MUCH more used to being able to do research and find my answers >:/
[11:29:37] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/7qkwLyx0/
[11:30:28] <taplar> i'd suggest giving this site a read, or at least bookmarking it for reference http://learn.jquery.com/
[11:31:11] <jcbdev> taplar: Thanks...for both
[11:31:34] <jcbdev> taplar: I believe I see what you were getting at.
[12:58:10] <carcrash> Anyone know what I am doing wrong? JQuery is loaded, but none of the functions work? details: https://hastebin.com/cayiricode.lua
[12:59:09] <taplar> that's not how you import js
[12:59:17] <taplar> your trying to include it like a stylesheet
[13:00:04] <taplar> use <script src="..."></script> instead
[13:01:24] <carcrash> lol whoops. thanks.
[13:19:39] <cocoabro> Hi
[13:20:14] <cocoabro> How would I randomize 3 different colors, and push it into a var, use it in a css and do it again? would this generally just be a generic loop?
[13:20:25] <cocoabro> css style*
[13:20:49] <taplar> sounds more like a ##javascript question
[13:30:07] <ServerSage> Hey folks, so based on reading the documentation I think I know the answer to be no, but thought I'd ask anyway. I have an AJAX call expecting XML to a CGI script that takes a while to run (5-10 minutes), but prints out results from time to time. What I'm wondering is if the data it prints out while running can be acted on before the CGI script finishes?
[13:30:41] <taplar> yeah, you have to make the ajax request be chucked, iirc
[13:31:33] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6789703/how-to-write-javascript-in-client-side-to-receive-and-parse-chunked-response-i
[13:34:03] <ServerSage> taplar: That might do it, thanks for the info!
[16:25:43] <Billdr> I'm trying to debug someone's plugin and learn some more about javascript along the way. I came accross this loop in jquery ui. `for( ; i <length; i++){//stuff}` Is there a reason that's not a while?
[16:26:16] <taplar> developer flavor
[16:27:05] <Billdr> Okay. I thought my brain fell out for a minute there. Thanks.
[16:48:44] <Mandevwin> Hello guys. I have a custom module that has stopped working in one of my obsolete web apps. The function in question throws a "jquery is not defined" error. Viewing source of the page shows no are in which jquery is loaded. The html is all generated in php, so it is getting frustrating trying to find where to load the jquery at. Any ideas?
[16:51:08] <taplar> it just has to be included before any script that uses it
[16:51:28] <Mandevwin> my grep finally just finished and i believe i found the file with the script
[16:51:31] <Mandevwin> wow timing
[16:51:36] <Mandevwin> that grep took hours
[16:52:32] <Mandevwin> This is an old application, one that i believe was running with jquery 1.41 -- think OI should try 3.2.1?
[16:52:57] <taplar> what browsers are you wanting support for?
[16:53:15] <Mandevwin> chrome edge/ie firefox and safari
[16:53:35] <taplar> so ie edge only?
[16:54:09] <Mandevwin> I need support in most well-used browsers. not just ie and edge.
[16:54:21] <taplar> so what's the oldest version of ie that you care about?
[16:54:32] <Mandevwin> though this specific function is just for staff so i could get away with just chrome and safari
[16:54:45] <Mandevwin> i dont really have any cares for IE haha
[16:55:01] <taplar> then i'd suggest first try going to the latest 2.X version and see if anything breaks.
[16:55:06] <taplar> if not, then try 3.X
[16:55:14] <taplar> if it breaks, revert back to 2.X
[16:55:59] <Mandevwin> this look about right? http://dpaste.com/16G13QZ
[16:56:47] <taplar> no, your actual scripts don't go in the script tag that includes a js file
[16:56:49] <Mandevwin> and yes, there you go with some personal identifiers haha
[16:56:53] <Mandevwin> oh
[16:56:58] <Mandevwin> so scrip above it with the js?
[16:57:01] <Mandevwin> script*
[16:57:11] <taplar> you have to have one tag that pulls in the jquery, then another one that has your in document script(s)
[16:57:20] <taplar> in that order
[16:57:20] <Mandevwin> okay thank you
[16:59:13] <Mandevwin> hey now im not getting that error, only a mixed content error for the modules main php file
[16:59:18] <Mandevwin> that's progress!
[16:59:35] <taplar> :)
[16:59:56] <taplar> i'm heading out for the weekend.  have a good day
[17:03:52] <Mandevwin> anyone willing to look at this script? fixed loading of jquery and am getting no errors, but the function does not work
[17:13:35] <Mandevwin> my script is supposed to mark an image as "free" "new" or "not free" and "not new" -- but it only works to mark as "free" and "not new", not the reverse of those. can anyone assist?
[17:15:57] <pavonia> Mandevwin: Paste a test case
[17:17:18] <Mandevwin> pavonia, https://pastebin.com/p6hZvGHX
[17:18:21] <robertmaxrees> so what here isn't working?
[17:18:30] <pavonia> This is just the JS, it's hard to test without a full document
[17:18:45] <Mandevwin> when i try to set "new" or "not free" nothing happens, but i get no errors either in the UI or in console
[17:19:04] <robertmaxrees> Mandevwin you mean toggleFreeState and toggleNewState don't work?
[17:19:05] <Mandevwin> pavonia, you want the entire php file?
[17:19:19] <Mandevwin> robertmaxrees, both half work
[17:19:30] <robertmaxrees> what about them doesn't work then?
[17:19:38] <pavonia> No, a jsfiddle would be good, but I see you are using POST requests ...
[17:20:11] <Mandevwin> robertmaxrees, in togglefreestate the "else" doesnt work, and in togglenewstate ONLY the "else" works
[17:20:36] <Mandevwin> pavonia, it is a very old software
[17:20:54] <robertmaxrees> "the else doesn't work" meaning...
[17:20:55] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:21:13] <Mandevwin> "else
[17:21:13] <Mandevwin>         func = "setNotFree";" -- that does not do anything...
[17:21:40] <Mandevwin> and "   if (text.data == "Mark New")
[17:21:40] <Mandevwin>         func = "setNew"; -- does not work
[17:21:41] <robertmaxrees> heh, "does not do anything" is vague.  do you mean thgat var doesn't get set to what you need?
[17:21:54] <Mandevwin> robertmaxrees, indeed. in both cases
[17:22:01] <Mandevwin> robertmaxrees, and no error is thrown
[17:22:04] <robertmaxrees> are you hitting those conditions in the first place?
[17:22:10] <Mandevwin> yes
[17:22:34] <robertmaxrees> and have you coinsoel logged in that toggleState function?
[17:22:41] <robertmaxrees> *console.log'd
[17:22:44] <robertmaxrees> that particular var I mean.
[17:23:08] <Mandevwin> If by having the console up, yes. Is there a specific logging function to it?
[17:23:11] <pavonia> Does a "data" object for arbitrary elements even exist?
[17:23:18] <Mandevwin> the logs are created in real time i thought
[17:23:37] <robertmaxrees> Mandevwin i mean used the console.log() fujnction to log out the value of those vars.
[17:23:48] <Mandevwin> pavonia, i have no idea. I was given this project after our web admin left, it worked for a while an suddenly stopped
[17:24:05] <Mandevwin> i have never administered a website before this
[17:24:46] <robertmaxrees> console.log(func);
[17:24:51] <robertmaxrees> stick that right before that $.post
[17:24:55] <robertmaxrees> do you get back what you expect?
[17:24:59] <Mandevwin> okay thanks one sec
[17:25:23] <robertmaxrees> also - be aware that "func" is a global variable here that can change at any time so you might be hitting weird race conditions.
[17:26:47] <Mandevwin> I am clicking the button representative of the function. Screen flashes, page reloads, nothing logged in console, no change to variable
[17:26:57] <robertmaxrees> hold up.
[17:27:08] <robertmaxrees> so you're reloading the page?
[17:27:14] <Mandevwin> it apparently reloads
[17:27:18] <Mandevwin> it flashes anyway
[17:27:32] <Mandevwin> the items do on the page, not the page, my bad
[17:27:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:27:57] <robertmaxrees> how are you binding these functions?
[17:28:04] <robertmaxrees> and what kinds of elements are they bound to?
[17:28:07] <Mandevwin> buttons
[17:28:21] <robertmaxrees> in a form?
[17:28:22] <Mandevwin> in the admin panel of the web app
[17:28:29] <Mandevwin> it is an image gallery
[17:28:36] <robertmaxrees> are they in forms thoughj?
[17:28:40] <robertmaxrees> html forms
[17:28:53] <Mandevwin> yes they are
[17:29:06] <robertmaxrees> and how are these being called?
[17:29:17] <robertmaxrees> onclick attributes?
[17:29:24] <pavonia> Hhm, interesting, there is a .data attribute of type string. No idea what it denotes, though
[17:29:42] <Mandevwin> robertmaxrees, the functions are onclick yes
[17:30:06] <robertmaxrees> Mandevwin so you're doing onclick="toggleFreeState()" basically?
[17:30:06] <Mandevwin> "<button id="buttonFree" onclick="toggleFreeState(this.id, 291972, 291968)">Mark Free</button>"
[17:30:10] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:30:11] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[17:30:22] <robertmaxrees> the forms are submitting which causes the page to reload.
[17:30:42] <Mandevwin> Do you mind showing me the error of my ways?
[17:30:51] <Mandevwin> I really am an amateur
[17:30:53] <robertmaxrees> i can help guide you through the fix :)
[17:31:02] <robertmaxrees> so are both of these buttons inside the same form?
[17:31:13] <Mandevwin> yes
[17:31:37] <Mandevwin> wait so by form i want to be clear
[17:31:42] <robertmaxrees> <form>
[17:31:46] <robertmaxrees> the tag
[17:32:18] <Mandevwin> no it looks like that is just for the search block. the gallery pulls into a div by category
[17:32:31] <Mandevwin> a section-group div
[17:32:45] <robertmaxrees> you sure about that?
[17:32:52] <Mandevwin> i can show you the source
[17:32:53] <robertmaxrees> there are no ancestor forms for them?
[17:33:49] <Mandevwin> https://pastebin.com/KVeKw8Jw
[17:34:20] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[17:35:41] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/082644155d2b
[17:35:44] <robertmaxrees> this is the basic idea
[17:35:55] <robertmaxrees> that might work.
[17:35:58] <robertmaxrees> it might not - i'm not sure.
[17:36:22] <robertmaxrees> basically, don't use onclick and cancel the event,
[17:36:55] <Mandevwin> okay, so change both of those, the buttonfree and buttonnew
[17:37:13] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[17:37:19] <robertmaxrees> they should both follow that pattern.
[17:37:51] <Mandevwin> I will try it and report back.
[17:38:20] <robertmaxrees> do you understand the changes?
[17:40:25] <Mandevwin> robertmaxrees, so that is in the source, im not sure how to translate that change over to my actual template: https://pastebin.com/BcgSem5Y
[17:40:40] <robertmaxrees> where are you lost?
[17:41:45] <robertmaxrees> like, do you understand how that html is getting generated?
[17:42:54] <Mandevwin> I believe so, but im not sure how to translate your change to data-vid and data-wid over to the actual template
[17:43:20] <robertmaxrees> why don't you just try?
[17:43:20] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:43:25] <robertmaxrees> you won't hurt anything,
[17:47:25] <Mandevwin> robertmaxrees, I just dont understand. what do i replace "onclick="toggleNewState" with?
[17:47:45] <Mandevwin> what is in your example is a specific image id
[17:48:01] <robertmaxrees> you don't use onclick any more.
[17:48:36] <robertmaxrees> like I said - you shouldn't use onclick.  you add $('#buttonFree').on('click', function(e) { in your JS for that now.,
[17:48:46] <Mandevwin> what do i replace this string with in my template?
[17:48:47] <Mandevwin> <button id="buttonNew" onclick="toggleNewState(this.id, {$child.id}, {$block.pazzlesimage.fetchWpcItem.wpcid})">{if $isFlaggedNew}Mark Not New{else}Mark New{/if}</button>
[17:49:05] <robertmaxrees> i won't do it for you duder.
[17:49:05] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:49:21] <Mandevwin> That's fine, im just confused. I get what you want me to change in the script
[17:49:27] <robertmaxrees> then try?
[17:49:53] <robertmaxrees> if vId before was {$child.id}, but now it's data-vid, what should you do?
[17:53:08] <Mandevwin> I just dont see where vId is before {$child.id} anywhere. make fun of me if you must :(
[17:53:15] <robertmaxrees> i'm not.
[17:53:23] <Mandevwin> I mean now that i ve said that
[17:53:24] <robertmaxrees> you're not looking at the full picture.
[17:53:44] <robertmaxrees> remember how you were passing those arguments to the JS function?
[17:55:25] <robertmaxrees> \}||
[17:55:32] <robertmaxrees> woops.
[17:56:39] <Mandevwin> I am sorry, do not understand. I did change the rest of the script other than the buttons, and all the images were flagged as "new" and "not free" though, which is nice. But i cant make any changes with the buttons how they are.
[17:56:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:56:54] <Mandevwin> I'll think about it some more
[17:56:56] <robertmaxrees> tion
[17:56:56] <robertmaxrees> [2017:06:02:14:30:55] <Migs> she's insanely brillia
[17:56:58] <robertmaxrees> woops.
[17:57:09] <robertmaxrees> erm, so before you had function toggleState(buttonId, vId, wId, func) { right?
[17:57:12] <robertmaxrees> \
[17:57:19] <robertmaxrees> *or the other function - whatever that was called.
[17:58:11] <robertmaxrees> function toggleFreeState(buttonId, vId, wId) - notice how there are three args being passed there?
[17:58:21] <Mandevwin> Yes
[17:58:27] <robertmaxrees> buttonId, vId, and wId
[17:59:13] <robertmaxrees> do you understand how that related to the original html you had for the buttons?
[17:59:21] <Mandevwin> Not really
[17:59:24] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:59:38] <robertmaxrees> do you understand how to call functions in javascript?
[17:59:51] <Mandevwin> nope
[17:59:57] <robertmaxrees> that's why you're lost.
[18:00:04] <Mandevwin> I know nothing really about javascript
[18:00:09] <Mandevwin> i was just told "fix it"
[18:00:13] <robertmaxrees> so it's basically the order things are in.
[18:00:41] <robertmaxrees> separated by commas.
[18:01:33] <robertmaxrees> so function myFunction(one, two three) {} - you'd do myFunction('foo', 'bar', 'baz').  see the three args?
[18:01:48] <Mandevwin> Yes I do
[18:02:10] <robertmaxrees> so does that make a little more sense now?
[18:02:15] <robertmaxrees> relating back to your original code?
[18:02:40] <Mandevwin> yup
[18:02:44] <Mandevwin> Okay that makes more sense
[18:02:48] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:02:51] <robertmaxrees> easy template change, no
[18:02:52] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:03:01] <Mandevwin> so buttonid is "this.id"
[18:03:21] <Mandevwin> vId is "{$child.id}"
[18:03:28] <robertmaxrees> sounds about right.
[18:03:33] <robertmaxrees> brb
[18:13:00] <clearcut> give me a job
[18:13:30] <Mandevwin> so this is still not working. I know i must be missing something. https://pastebin.com/HB3wB204
[18:16:41] <robertmaxrees> back
[18:17:05] <robertmaxrees> Mandevwin is the page still reloading?
[18:17:16] <Mandevwin> robertmaxrees, i made some changes. buttons no longer do anything at all, no reloading.
[18:17:40] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:17:45] <robertmaxrees> where's the change to the template?
[18:18:41] <Mandevwin> ive made several changes
[18:18:43] <Mandevwin> https://pasteboard.co/dQPjHM8V6.png
[18:19:04] <robertmaxrees> the template is the same.
[18:19:11] <robertmaxrees> you need to update that part, as well.
[18:19:13] <robertmaxrees> not just the JS.
[18:19:14] <Mandevwin> oh i did change the buttons
[18:19:24] <robertmaxrees> the paste doesn't reflect that.
[18:19:33] <Mandevwin> I know, i tried both ways since you left. one moment
[18:19:52] <Mandevwin> they are in this format now: <button id="buttonFree"</button>
[18:19:59] <Mandevwin> i took off the onclick stuff
[18:20:02] <robertmaxrees> i need to see the actual rendered buttons.,
[18:20:09] <robertmaxrees> the data attributes need to be on there.
[18:20:13] <Mandevwin> and have no idea what to replace it with
[18:20:14] <Mandevwin> okay
[18:21:51] <robertmaxrees> we talked about the changes you need to make to the buttons >.>
[18:22:31] <robertmaxrees> also: there's a minor error in the js.
[18:22:50] <robertmaxrees>  toggleState(buttonId, vId, wId, func); should be  toggleState(this.id, vId, wId, func);
[18:24:09] <Mandevwin> what do i replace the word "onclick" with, or just get rid of it
[18:24:18] <robertmaxrees> what did I say before? :)
[18:24:23] <Mandevwin> "dont use it"
[18:24:24] <robertmaxrees> don't use onclick.
[18:24:32] <Mandevwin> so just remove it
[18:24:34] <robertmaxrees> notice how your js has .on() in it now?
[18:24:41] <robertmaxrees> yes, remove it.

[18:24:54] <Mandevwin> this look better? "<button id="buttonFree" toggleFreeState(this.id, vId, wId)">{if $isFlaggedFree}Mark Not Free{else}Mark Free{/if}</button>"
[18:24:58] <robertmaxrees> this is what the html should end up looking like.
[18:24:58] <robertmaxrees> nop.
[18:25:02] <robertmaxrees> no function call at all.
[18:25:05] <robertmaxrees> <button id="buttonFree" data-vid="291972" data-wid="291968">Mark Free</button>
[18:25:12] <robertmaxrees> what's what the rendered html should look like.,
[18:30:39] <Mandevwin> <button id="buttonFree" data-vid="{$this.data('vid')}" data-wid="{$this.data('wid')}">Mark Free</button> ?
[18:31:36] <robertmaxrees> \...
[18:32:03] <Mandevwin> I've got no clue man
[18:32:10] <robertmaxrees> $this.data('vid') is for inside the function only.
[18:33:00] <robertmaxrees> gotta use whatever the template was using for those values before.
[18:34:32] <Mandevwin> okay well i gotta go soon, i really do appreciate your help, ill try to figure it out next week
[18:38:52] <Mandevwin> wait i think i got it then
[18:38:59] <Mandevwin> <button id="buttonFree" data-vid="{$child.id}" data-wid="{$block.pazzlesimage.fetchWpcItem.wpcid}}">Mark Free</button>
[18:39:14] <robertmaxrees> booooooooooooom
[18:39:59] <Mandevwin> but that way it does not change the buttons to "mark not new" and "mark not free" -- guess that will require some more work
[18:39:59] <robertmaxrees> you mean change the text?
[18:39:59] <Mandevwin> indeed.
[18:39:59] <robertmaxrees> where are you expecting the button text to change?
[18:40:00] <robertmaxrees> what code, I mean.
[18:40:00] <Mandevwin> "if $isFlaggedNew}Mark Not New{else}Mark New{/if}</button>"
[18:40:01] <robertmaxrees> that code doesn't re-run after the page loads.
[18:40:01] <Mandevwin> Yeah i actually took that code out
[18:40:01] <Mandevwin> so ill have to put it back in, again just for staff so i think if it does not refresh in real-time they will be fine
[18:40:02] <robertmaxrees> you can change the text via js.
[18:40:02] <Mandevwin> I appreciate your help! I have to go for now, but may be back in the future, you've been very informative robertmaxrees
[18:40:02] <Mandevwin> I really do want to learn this. well, especially now that im kind of forced into it
[18:40:03] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[18:40:03] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:40:03] <robertmaxrees> and try.jquery.com
