[02:53:59] <Duikb00t> o/
[03:16:55] <Duikb00t> Meh I'm still struggling with the http://kopy.io/HGCtG#line-34  autocomplete. I would like to grab the values inside the _renderItem methods but it drives me nuts ><
[03:42:24] <Cork> Duikb00t: you need to stop replacing the object with a string in the source
[03:42:38] <Cork> i've already told you this several times
[04:05:43] <Duikb00t> hmm ok
[04:15:59] <Duikb00t> You mean: return el.city + ' ' + el.zip_code + ' ' + el.name + ' ' +  el.street + ' ' + el.no;   that line
[04:16:10] <Cork> yes
[04:16:25] <Duikb00t> hmm but that line gives me the right 'output ' in the dropdown
[04:16:27] <Cork> just replace the entire $.map loop and everything with response(data)
[04:16:33] <Duikb00t> hmm
[04:16:45] <Cork> Duikb00t: ya, but that is meant to be handeled by _renderItem
[04:17:03] <Cork> source is meant to grab the source data, not format it
[04:17:15] <Duikb00t> But return it : return response(data);
[04:17:29] <Cork> ya, inside a loop that calls response
[04:17:41] <Cork> so it is completely borked
[04:18:11] <Cork> what you do is first you call response the with data once for every row in the response
[04:18:24] <Cork> and then you overwrite the response data with the result of $.map
[04:19:13] <Duikb00t> Hmm
[04:19:59] <Duikb00t> OK it makes sense now
[04:20:07] <Duikb00t> When I do in the _renderItem console.log(item) I get the full response
[04:20:57] <Cork> and in there you then take ui.item and concat the values you want to display
[04:21:34] <Cork> and in select you can later again do ui.item.otherKeyValueYouWantToUse
[04:21:42] <Cork> and set it where you want
[04:22:26] <Cork> additional plus is you can format the data with html if you want in _renderItem
[04:22:30] <Cork> something you can't do in source
[04:23:03] <realies> anyone with dropzone experience?
[04:23:15] <realies> canceling the upload batch populates the progressbar...
[04:23:39] <Cork> realies: by dropzone you mean a specific plugin?
[04:23:52] <Cork> (the term is generic and has a ui meaning)
[04:24:52] <Duikb00t> ok this is already going step by step: http://kopy.io/Ue36M
[04:25:08] <realies> Cork, yeah...
[04:25:17] <Cork> realies: then no, never used it
[04:26:19] <Duikb00t> I think I only have to fix some mapping stuff
[05:01:35] <asils> Hi. I'm trying to create a user script for changing the way the page looks in reader mode, and it seems like the JQuery $(document).ready() event is fired twice.
[05:01:38] <asils> You can verify it by adding the following greacemonkey script: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a55cc3a40de1cdff8f6165c7997ad5ba
[05:01:40] <asils> any idea why this is happening?
[05:19:59] <shai231> Hello, does it possible to know from javascript if element has the "onload" attribute and if its contains some string?
[05:20:44] <shai231> Hello, does it possible to know from javascript if element has the "onload" attribute and if its contains some string?
[05:48:28] <Cork> shampine: the attribute, sure, if it has the onload event; no
[05:48:50] <Cork> if(elm.onload != "") {}
[05:49:31] <realies> $("body").on("mouseenter", function() { console.log("foo"); }); not working, any clues?
[05:49:51] <Cork> mouseenter makes no sense for body
[05:49:57] <realies> why?
[05:50:02] <Cork> are you looking for mousemove?
[05:50:06] <realies> no
[05:50:14] <Cork> cause it is always at least on the body
[05:50:22] <Cork> or are you looking for blur?
[05:50:26] <realies> oh, wait
[05:51:13] <realies> i meant dragenter, which also doesnt work
[05:51:35] <Cork> dragenter?
[05:51:43] <Cork> i don't think there is a dragenter event
[05:51:51] <Cork> (not that mouseenter is a jquery fake event)
[05:52:35] <Cork> ah, nope remembered wrong
[05:54:21] <Cork> realies: have you tried binding it on window instead of body?
[05:54:32] <Cork> that is the only difference from what i do here
[05:55:02] <realies> i've bound it to document and it worked
[05:55:13] <realies> can you store a selector in a variable and then use jquery methods on it?
[05:55:30] <Cork> sure, jquery doesn't care
[05:55:37] <Cork> you can stor a dom element too
[05:55:39] <realies> eg foo=$('#foo'); foo.on('crap',...
[05:55:45] <Cork> sure
[05:55:48] <realies> cool
[05:55:53] <Cork> that isn't a selector though
[05:56:06] <Cork> it is a jquery instance, or a result collection if you prefer
[05:56:14] <Cork> meaning it is a static list of dom elements
[05:56:18] <Cork> it won't change if the dom changes
[05:56:25] <realies> oh, so I need to take the first instance?
[05:56:27] <Cork> (in what elements will be included)
[05:56:59] <Cork> ex. you have <button id="test"></button>
[05:57:09] <Cork> and in the code on load you do var foo = $('#test')
[05:57:18] <Cork> later you replace the form (including the button)
[05:57:21] <realies> $(foo)?
[05:57:27] <Cork> foo will now point to the old button
[05:57:33] <Cork> not the one that exists in the page
[05:57:40] <realies> yeah
[05:57:48] <Cork> if you want a "live" reference
[05:57:56] <Cork> you have to store the selector, meaning the string
[05:58:14] <Cork> but if the element won't change it is better to store the jquery instance
[05:58:44] <Cork> just wanted to make sure you knew that is a caveat
[05:58:58] <realies> not gonna change and i like variables
[05:59:04] <Cork> heh
[05:59:25] <Cork> var foo = $(); foo.on() is identical to $().on() set from javascript
[05:59:38] <Cork> only difference is you get a local namespace variable
[05:59:56] <Cork> var foo = $().on(); foo.on() is fine too
[06:00:20] <Cork> or var foo = $().on(); foo.html().show() or...
[06:00:44] <realies> not sure where you're going at
[06:01:26] <Cork> realies: just meaning javascript sees no difference between $().on().html().show() and var foo = $().on(); foo.html().show()
[06:01:38] <Cork> it is all the same you have an object and you call properties on it
[06:01:51] <Cork> the first one you take the property directly from a function return
[06:01:59] <Cork> the second version just stores it in a variable first
[06:02:48] <Cork> ( $() is just a normal javascript function nothing special)
[07:18:21] <ArchNoob> Hi, is there a way i can look at elements inside much like doing console.log('inside obj', obj); ? But look inside $(selected-element) which contains some elements. When i do console.log($(element)) i get "jQuery { '0': HTMLTableDataCellElement {}, length: 1 }
[07:19:00] <ArchNoob> I'm using jsdom, and facing some TypeError: Cannot read property 'appendChild' of null
[07:34:43] <shoky> ArchNoob: you can log  $jqObj.length to see how many elements were selected, or $jqObj[0] to log the first selected element
[07:36:24] <ArchNoob> huh, thanks. I tried $jqObj.contents() and got some children, then added $jqObj.contents().find('p') and got the error. let me follow your advice.
[07:38:14] <ArchNoob> shoky: Both $(element)[0] and element[0] return the error. $(element).contents() show 3 elements. I'm not sure what is wrong now.
[07:38:20] <ArchNoob> Error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'appendChild' of null
[07:40:59] <shoky> ArchNoob: huh.. no idea what you're doing
[07:41:35] <shoky> make a jsfiddle or link to a testcase if you need further help
[07:43:03] <ArchNoob> Sure. Though, I have no idea where to really crop since it's a big crawling project.
[07:43:27] <shoky> no need for the whole project, just an isolated testcase
[07:43:47] <shoky> oh that's what you meant by crop i guess, sorry
[07:44:29] <ArchNoob> yeah .. hehe it's alright. I'm cropping it :)
[07:53:14] <ArchNoob> shoky: made a gist, Link: a<
[07:53:20] <ArchNoob> Oops..
[07:53:22] <ArchNoob> https://gist.github.com/maotora/15deaa3d06523097a5822a3598e796d7
[07:57:02] <ArchNoob> shoky: do you think this line "<TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P ALIGN="CENTER">P0110/0501</FONT></TD>" and every line written in this stupid way are the one making my queries fail?
[07:57:18] <ArchNoob> they are not closing the <p>..
[07:58:32] <ArchNoob> however my firebug seems to correct this, i wonder if jsdom does the same..
[07:58:52] <ArchNoob> *firefox.
[08:00:28] <ArchNoob> also, firefox doen't correct this, infact it's puting some red tags. only firebug displays this info dumbproof.
[08:01:19] <Cork> ArchNoob: why are you working in quirks mode?
[08:01:31] <Cork> that is slightly mad...
[08:02:02] <ArchNoob> what is that?
[08:02:10] <ArchNoob> quirks mode?
[08:02:27] <ArchNoob> Cork: ^
[08:04:25] <Cork> ArchNoob: you don't define a doctype
[08:04:36] <Cork> so you get pre standards compatible html spec
[08:04:43] <Cork> and that is called quirks mode
[08:04:49] <Cork> and is a really messy weird dom mode
[08:05:00] <ArchNoob> oooh, it's not my document.
[08:05:12] <ArchNoob> i'm crawling that info from a certain website.
[08:05:56] <ArchNoob> and it's a pretty old document format. I think they haven't changed the way they display their documents since 2003.
[08:06:05] <ArchNoob> no joke.
[08:06:48] <ArchNoob> Cork: ^
[08:08:28] <Cork> ArchNoob: then you will have to know that what you see in the html might not be what you're actually working with
[08:08:42] <Cork> as the dom will fiddle around with it when it gets loaded
[08:09:33] <ArchNoob> Cork: yeah, i'm using jsdom and i've seen some pretty bad formats and had to make exceptions and stuff.
[08:09:57] <ArchNoob> it's just now that one of the year's results failed (2013). and i can't make it work.
[08:10:04] <ArchNoob> i guess i'll work with it later or never. :P
[08:16:31] <shoky> ArchNoob: that's... not a testcase :P
[08:17:35] <verax5> hi
[08:17:37] <verax5> wassup
[08:20:15] <ArchNoob> shoky: hehe.. i should use jsfiddle then. To make something very usable.
[08:20:37] <ArchNoob> verax5: Sup!
[08:23:21] <verax5> whats crackin Arch
[08:23:25] <verax5> ArchNoob:
[08:29:37] <ArchNoob> cracking..
[08:42:23] <rjCousineau> hi, is there a better way to: $tbody.find('tr').eq(0).find('td').eq(0);
[08:42:45] <rjCousineau> cleaning way to write
[08:45:11] <shoky> rjCousineau there are more ways, whether its cleaner or not is arguable ;p  e.g.  .first() instead of .eq(0)   or .find('tr:first td:first')    or in most cases you can probably just do .find('td').first()  no need for selecting the <tr>
[08:46:45] <rjCousineau> I wonder if eq(0) performs better/worse than first()
[08:47:13] <shoky> rjCousineau it performs exactly the same
[08:47:23] <shoky> and that's not something you need to wonder about ever..
[08:47:31] <shoky> only if you actually have a performance problem
[08:47:52] <shoky> and i can guarantee you it won't come from .eq() or .first() :p
[08:52:41] <Cork> rjCousineau: if you can use the nth-child() selector instead of the js function :first it will make some real difference
[08:53:08] <Cork> depending on how often you need to run the selector though
[08:53:25] <Cork> if you don't run it on something like sliter mousemove or keydown it doesn't matter (resize...)
[08:58:53] <rjCousineau> great ty
[09:51:38] <rjCousineau> Hi I need help with a selector.  I have <table> <tbody>...</tbody> <tbody>...</tbody> </table>  I want to select all <tr>'s except the first one in each tbody.   tbody>tr:not(tr:first) works for the first <tbody> but not subsequent ones
[09:57:59] <rjCousineau> fiddle showing it doesn't work https://jsfiddle.net/nxqu19Lk/
[10:13:41] <rjCousineau>   figured it out.. find('tbody').find('tr:not(tr:first')
[10:21:06] <Duikb00t> hmm
[10:21:14] <Duikb00t> Cork:  :p im not yet there haha but it works almost
[10:36:56] <MikeD_> does a single event object get bubbled through all the handlers or is a new object created for each?
[10:50:22] <shoky> MikeD_: now there's a question i've never heard yet. good on ya ;p  i believe it's the same object, not 100% sure tho
[10:55:26] <MikeD_> i was surprised to find that new jquery wrappers are created for each method in a chain - it makes sense when I think about how/why, but it wasn't what I expected
[10:56:24] <MikeD_> i'm probably explaining that poorly, but the end result is that we lost a bunch of properties added to the jquery object when we used chaining of methods
[10:58:27] <shoky> gotcha
[11:49:05] <Mijagiii> Is there someone active here?
[11:49:24] <taplar> what's up?
[11:50:18] <Mijagiii> taplar: http://pastebin.com/fDMCjwtY
[11:50:26] <Mijagiii> taplar: why this is not working? the error:
[11:50:40] <Mijagiii> taplar:  Cannot read property 'getElementsByTagName' of null
[11:51:07] <taplar> what is 'slider'?
[11:51:35] <Mijagiii> taplar: a div
[11:51:41] <Mijagiii> taplar: and there are images in it
[11:51:51] <taplar> your using it as a variable in that method, but i don't see it defined
[11:52:26] <Mijagiii> so i should put it in ' ' ? and it will work?
[11:52:38] <taplar> if you are meaning it to be considered a string, yes
[11:52:45] <Mijagiii> i just want that function to check images from div 'slider'
[11:52:47] <Mijagiii> okay
[11:52:47] <Mijagiii> sec
[11:53:18] <Mijagiii> taplar: its working ,thx
[12:32:25] <arunkumar413> I'm thinking of building a drone. Any idea on the motors, propeller and power required to lift 400-500 grams
[12:32:36] <arunkumar413> Sorry wrong ping
[12:32:41] <robertmaxrees> haha
[12:37:07] * taplar notifies hls
[12:50:06] <taplar> you know they use drones in farming?
[12:52:01] <taplar> one of my uncles does something with seed or pesticide distribution or something.  he went to a conference a year or two ago and they were talking about how there were some debate about not allowing people to fly drones so high above farm fields.  apparently they use them to take pictures of the fields to get an idea about things
[12:52:32] <taplar> it was kinda interesting.  i was like, i need to talk with this uncle more
[12:53:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah - there's a lot of talk around cases like that.
[12:53:22] <robertmaxrees> particularly because people are dicks and abuse it a lot.
[13:22:35] <habs> Hi -- How can I use a protocol-dependent URL in a jquery get / ajax request, like $.get('//example.com')? When I try that I get "Invalid URL"
[13:25:13] <taplar> protocol-dependent?
[13:25:46] <dglambert> yo
[14:33:04] <Es0teric> how do i make it so that i execute some validation when a radio button is toggled?
[14:35:47] <robertmaxrees> use change.
[14:36:18] <robertmaxrees> *the event, i mean
[14:37:57] <skypce> hello all
[14:38:05] <skypce> i have problem with royaslider touch
[14:38:13] <skypce> do not advance to next slide
[14:38:20] <skypce> do you know about it?
[14:38:52] <robertmaxrees> does it work in normal mode?
[14:42:51] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[14:47:29] <jak2000> hi all
[14:47:46] <robertmaxrees> werddup
[15:28:20] <Es0teric> how do i make it so the code from line 11 to 62 doesnt execute if the user is on 'no' http://pastebin.com/BkK9t4Un ?
[15:30:32] <taplar> don't bind an event handler inside another event handler
[15:30:39] <taplar> you're binding multiple times
[15:32:55] <Es0teric> taplar so how can i do that then?
[15:33:04] <Es0teric> whats the best way for me to do that then
[15:33:14] <Es0teric> and accomplish the same thing
[15:34:04] <taplar> bind outside of that change handler
[15:34:18] <Es0teric> taplar what do you mean
[15:34:55] <taplar> you understand that your change() event handler happens multiple times, right?
[15:35:02] <Es0teric> taplar yeah
[15:35:22] <Es0teric> taplar why dont you just modify the paste so i can understand what you're talking about?
[15:35:25] <taplar> so each time it fires that 'yes' is selected, your creating a new 'submit' handler
[15:35:47] <taplar> right?
[15:35:49] <Es0teric> yes
[15:36:02] <taplar> so, move that submit binding to not be in that change() handler
[15:36:17] <Es0teric> i dont want that submit() to happen unless the user is on "yes"
[15:36:27] <Es0teric> through the radio button
[15:36:31] <robertmaxrees> then check if it's yes within the submit handler.
[15:36:34] <taplar> ^
[15:36:45] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees how do i do that?
[15:37:58] <taplar> select the element and check it's value
[15:38:16] <taplar> what's confusing you dude?
[15:38:41] <Es0teric> taplar both of them have values
[15:38:44] <Es0teric> thats whats confusing me
[15:39:00] <taplar> selet the selected one
[15:39:31] <taplar> $('.theClassOfTheThing:checked');
[15:40:21] <robertmaxrees> or use a quick filter.
[15:40:31] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/228os659/ freebie
[15:40:33] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy
[15:45:52] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees, taplar yeah got it.. thanks
[15:46:06] <robertmaxrees> basically, don't juggle event bindings.
[15:46:14] <robertmaxrees> focus on your handlers imo.
[15:46:26] <Es0teric> yeah i havent worked with jquery in awhile... i've been doing back-end php mostly
[15:46:37] <Es0teric> lately
[16:22:32] <jcjq> Hello, I have a script that selects multiple <optgroup>'s and loops through them with $.each and subsequently sets prop('selected',true) to each of the child <option>'s, however, only the first optgroups options become highlighted even though the prop is still true for the rest of the options. Am I missing something?
[16:27:23] <taplar> what's the size on the select?
[16:28:05] <taplar> can you show us a fiddle with the issue?
[16:32:08] <jcjq> I'm making a fiddle now but it's being wonky
[16:36:02] <jcjq> something to this effect. im not sure why its not working on fiddle but https://jsfiddle.net/bq4s55t9/1/
[16:39:29] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/bq4s55t9/2/ you got some other errors
[16:39:52] <taplar> you also don't have jquery included, one sec
[16:40:22] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/bq4s55t9/3/
[16:41:35] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/bq4s55t9/4/ <-- removed jquery from the html area
[17:15:51] <Darmani> How can I tell if my iframe is cross-domain?
[17:16:12] <taplar> the protocol/domain/port are different
[17:16:14] <robertmaxrees> is it pointing to another port, protocol, or domain?
[17:16:22] <robertmaxrees> haha
[17:16:28] <robertmaxrees> so basically.
[17:16:42] <Darmani> Where do I tell that stuff.
[17:16:47] <robertmaxrees> the src of the iframe
[17:16:51] <Darmani> ah
[17:16:54] <robertmaxrees> vs the url bar you're on.
[17:17:50] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: So if the url I'm on is '/my-activity' and the iframe src is '/direct_messages/50' that means it's cross domain?
[17:17:56] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:18:08] <robertmaxrees> that's a different path
[17:18:10] <taplar> protocol://domain:port
[17:18:13] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:18:21] <robertmaxrees> anythi
[17:18:31] <robertmaxrees> *anything not one of those three is unimportant.
[17:18:39] <Darmani> ohhh I see
[17:18:42] <robertmaxrees> protocol://domain:port/path?querystring
[17:18:58] <robertmaxrees> port is generally 80 and left off.  path and querystring can be different.
[17:19:14] <Darmani> it's localhost:3000 so I assume it's the same.
[17:19:59] <robertmaxrees> is the iframe also on localhost:3000 ?
[17:20:40] <Darmani> ya
[17:21:16] <taplar> maybe lets backup.  why ask this question?
[17:21:28] <taplar> you seeing an issue?
[17:21:50] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:22:13] <Darmani> no no there's nothing wrong with it. But I need to add a button that closes the iframe which is inside the iframe.
[17:22:21] <robertmaxrees> ew.
[17:22:25] <Darmani> So I'm trying to figure out which way to approach it.
[17:22:28] <Darmani> yeah...
[17:22:31] <robertmaxrees> why?
[17:22:34] <taplar> postMessage bro
[17:22:37] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:22:40] <robertmaxrees> why not just edit the source of the iframe?
[17:22:53] <Darmani> what are chu talkin about
[17:23:12] <robertmaxrees> nvm reread what you said
[17:23:14] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage
[17:23:43] <Darmani> taplar: Is that a plugin?
[17:23:49] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[17:23:49] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: what do you mean.
[17:23:51] <Darmani> Q.Q
[17:24:04] <robertmaxrees> i was asking why you were going to try to add the button via jquery
[17:24:12] <robertmaxrees> buuut i realized that's probably not what you meant.
[17:24:14] <robertmaxrees> just use postmessage.
[17:24:27] <Darmani> nah the button is there I just need it to respond to the code lol
[17:24:41] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: I'll look at it.
[17:24:50] <jak2000> hi robertmaxrees want a beer?
[17:25:01] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 hah, i'm getting one at 5.
[17:25:05] <robertmaxrees> thankfull.
[17:27:26] <Darmani> oh that's cool
[17:27:32] <Darmani> it looks like it would owkr
[17:27:38] <Darmani> work*
[17:28:55] <Darmani> Wait is this only for sending messages?
[17:29:05] <robertmaxrees> which is what you wnat.
[17:29:22] <taplar> click button, send message.  parent catches it, closes the iframe
[17:29:31] <taplar> ezypzy
[17:29:49] <Darmani> ic
[17:31:41] <Darmani> I hate reading docs
[17:31:42] <Darmani> honestly
[17:31:51] <Darmani> I'd rather watch YouTube videos on how to do this kind of shit.
[17:32:31] <robertmaxrees> why?
[17:32:44] <robertmaxrees> the amount of time and effort in producing and digesting that content...
[17:33:35] <Darmani> I'm just not a reader. I need it explained to me or written in a way I can understand.
[17:34:53] <Darmani> I learned most of my programming that way to be honest.
[17:35:03] <Darmani> Codecademy, YouTube, lol
[17:35:19] <robertmaxrees> eventually learning how to read docs is a really big skill.
[17:36:06] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: I'm sure you're right.
[17:36:08] * Darmani sighs
[17:37:53] <taplar> it's like going to a restaraunt and someone asking you to read the menu to them
[17:38:15] <taplar> you should be able to read your own menu, ;)
[17:38:52] <Darmani> taplar: It's easy when the menu is written in English and not Chinese =P
[17:38:55] <taplar> you'll probably find yourself eating out by your self one day, all alone, just you and the menu
[17:39:37] <taplar> eh, maybe cursive, not chinese
[17:40:25] <Darmani> Doctor's Cursive.
[17:40:27] <Darmani> There we go.
[18:36:17] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: So I came up with this function to "hide" the chat window to make it look like it closed.
[18:36:17] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/b38bd7642f020f73e0ebf0e4a0c2eb39
[18:36:59] <Darmani> What's weird is I get an error on this line https://gist.github.com/mfifth/b38bd7642f020f73e0ebf0e4a0c2eb39#file-close_window-js-L6
[18:37:06] <Darmani> It says my function doesn't exist :[
[18:37:13] <robertmaxrees> uhm
[18:37:17] <robertmaxrees> why aren't you using postmessage?
[18:37:40] <Darmani> Because I couldn't figure it out :[
[18:37:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:37:51] <robertmaxrees> so then let's figure that out?
[18:37:56] <robertmaxrees> "hey here's how you do the thing"
[18:37:56] <Darmani> ._.
[18:38:00] <Darmani> ok
[18:38:23] <robertmaxrees> "so i'm going to ignore what everybody else told me to do and try my own thing.  but my thing won't work."
[18:38:50] <Darmani> Lol I just wanted to see if it would work.
[18:39:00] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:47:39] <Guest44959> hi guys ive been looking at https://codepen.io/ckm100/pen/dPLyjZ and was wondering if there is a fast way to make each button click auto click the + button, so theres no need to press the + button
[18:50:08] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: So can we figure it out? Lol
[18:50:11] <Darmani> I'm still strugglin
[19:32:53] <Motoservo> Can somebody tell me why this animation has such a lag?
[19:32:54] <Motoservo> http://pastebin.com/s1M90WVW
[19:33:09] <Motoservo> Several seconds before it responds to a simple slide effect.
[19:33:42] <Motoservo> Up to 7 or 8 seconds, sometimes.
[19:45:42] <Motoservo> I *think* stop() may be doing the trick.
[19:47:04] <MACscr_> ok, so i want to get a count of how many images are within a div, this includes any child divs, etc. Anyway, i thought i would do $("#upload_column").find('img').length, but that came up with 6, when there are only 3. I then did $("#upload_column").find('img').attr(src) to see which ones those were, but it says source not defined.
[19:47:09] <MACscr_> ser, src not defined
[19:47:14] <MACscr_> er*
[19:47:15] <MACscr_> lol
[19:47:20] <MACscr_> any suggestions?
[20:06:19] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: he's back!
[20:06:29] <robertmaxrees> for a few.
[20:06:47] <Darmani> I thought you were going out for a beer?
[20:07:10] <robertmaxrees> nah that got cancelled.  i'ma go home to my pup in a bit instead.
[20:09:41] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: bruh if I was up there I'd go get a beer with you
[20:09:54] <robertmaxrees> hah.  i'm actually pretty boring irl.
[20:13:04] <Mijagiii> Anyone alive here? got simple ( i guess ) question :D
[20:13:13] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: everyone is dude. except for people who are rich.
[20:14:24] <Mijagiii> 		table[number].style.display = 'block';
[20:14:30] <Mijagiii> How can I add some exception to this?
[20:14:56] <Mijagiii> if i want to have all id's from table have display:none except table[number] ?
[20:15:24] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[20:15:36] <robertmaxrees> Mijagiii .filter()?
[20:18:38] <Mijagiii> robertmaxrees: reading about this atm, Jesus it is so complicated
[20:18:51] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[20:18:54] <robertmaxrees> you can also juist use .not()
[20:18:56] <robertmaxrees> lots of options
[20:19:16] <Mijagiii> oh that will be much more simple :D
[20:19:58] <Mijagiii> robertmaxrees: but .not is jquery right?
[20:21:08] <robertmaxrees> .. yep.
[20:21:16] <robertmaxrees> since you're in #jquery i gave the relevant answer heh
[20:21:19] <MACscr_> we are in #jquery
[20:21:22] <MACscr_> lol
[20:21:24] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[20:21:35] <Mijagiii> i know i know just askin to be sure, relax :(
[20:21:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:21:47] <MACscr_> why are you telling us to relax?
[20:22:02] <MACscr_> doesnt really make any sense
[20:22:11] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:22:13] <robertmaxrees> aaaaanyway
[20:22:20] <robertmaxrees> Mijagiii get what you need?
[20:24:28] <robertmaxrees> welp
[20:25:53] <Mijagiii> robertmaxrees: trying to use filter() metod but dont have idea how to apply this to my line of code
[20:36:05] <robertmaxrees> Mijagiii make a fiddle then :)
[20:36:13] <robertmaxrees> show me what you're trying to do.
[22:09:53] <WhirledPress> what is the status of jQuery.expr[':
[22:22:46] <WhirledPress> can someone explain why things like offset() or position() don't accept parameters?
[22:24:26] <WhirledPress> it would be great if you could add a parameter object like {target:somdiv} so that $(elem).offset(targ) would give you the offset in pixels between two objects
