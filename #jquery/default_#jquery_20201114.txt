[15:29:22] <audioburn> https://bpa.st/VZKQ I'm trying to remove all "!important" styles using javascript. for some reason, the `.replace()` function isn't functioning properly ("!important" is still in the styles). Can anyone help?
[16:05:07] <shoky_> audioburn: document.styleSheets is read-only
[16:31:01] <shoky_> audioburn: actually that doesn't matter.  is working for me with .style.cssText - and no reason to use jquery for this..  https://jsfiddle.net/bz69s5L7/
