[12:42:21] <dsc_> Question regarding .each(): https://pastebin.com/raw/wWgghEnD
[12:43:34] <shoky> dsc_: yes, .map.  you can call .get() on the result to get the actual array
[12:45:18] <dsc_> shoky: ah, I made it work.. https://pastebin.com/raw/YPQfisMV
[14:01:47] <fumk> bon, il va y avoir ce match
[20:12:58] <wea0> Can I select elements based on a condition that has to be fulfilled by all of its child elements?
[20:13:08] <wea0> Here's an example: https://jsfiddle.net/r4a3p71d/1/
[20:20:45] <shoky> wea0: you can use .filter()  example- https://jsfiddle.net/r4a3p71d/2/
[20:22:13] <shoky> (using .get() to get an actual array, and using .every() on that array)
[20:23:42] <wea0> sorry I am noob, what does "=>" syntax mean?
[20:24:43] <shoky> wea0: it's an arrow function, an anonymous function.  x => y    is same as   function(x) { return y; }
[20:24:53] <wea0> OK, thanks.
[20:26:11] <shoky> wea0:  here's with regular functions-  https://jsfiddle.net/r4a3p71d/6/
[20:26:42] <shoky> .every() is  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every
[21:55:41] <Braden`> Hello!
[21:56:53] <Braden`> data: {ajaxAfeOpen: 1, AfeOpen: AfeId, AafeOpenPassphrase: $(AfeId + "-password").val()},   <--- The PHP side is never receiving $(AfeId + "-password").val().   Am I doing something wrong?
[22:10:51] <Braden`> Anyone?
[22:12:51] <shoky> Braden`: is it receiving the other params?  are you sure $(AfeId + "-password").val()  gets what you want?
[22:16:54] <Braden`> It receives the other parms
[22:18:28] <Braden`> Yes, $(AfeId + "-password").val() should be correct.  Its an input element with an id of <?=$afeId?>-password
[22:18:59] <shoky> should be?  why not make sure?  log it
[22:19:11] <Braden`> ok
[22:19:14] <shoky> my guess would be that AfeId does not contain a '#'
[22:19:20] <shoky> so you're not querying for an id
[22:19:57] <Braden`> Its undefined
[22:20:05] <Braden`> Correct.  It should be a password
[22:20:23] <shoky> you need to pass a selector
[22:20:32] <Braden`> How do I do that?
[22:20:34] <shoky> e.g.  '#foo'
[22:21:14] <shoky> if it's a simple id with no special characters or spaces,  you can just add a '#' up front..   '#' + AfeId + '-password'   i guess?
[22:21:26] <Braden`> Ohhhhhh
[22:21:31] * Braden` facepalms
[22:21:38] <Braden`> Thanks
[22:22:28] <Braden`> That fixed it
[22:22:34] <Braden`> I appreciate the assistance, thank you
[22:22:40] <shoky> np
