[00:25:44] <sadtaco> Is there something out there in javascript already where you can give it two strings, and it'll show line by line comparisons like github has?
[00:26:33] <xec> sadtaco: i haven't tried it myself, but you could look at https://github.com/cemerick/jsdifflib
[00:27:50] <sadtaco> I'll take a look. Thanks
[00:56:42] <eebanos> hello!
[00:58:01] <seich-> eebanos: hi!
[01:04:36] <hxm> hello good morning
[01:05:46] <hxm> i have a problem i dont know how to solve, in this site http://ejecutor.bot.eggdrop.es/ and going to Herramientas->Visor it asks for login (if you use anything it will work) and when press  Entrar, it should show the logviewer.php page, but it opens in a new window
[01:05:55] <hxm> i try to jsfiddle it but im not able
[01:09:01] <hxm> what i want to reach is every pages stay loaded as ajax
[01:11:01] <Cork> hxm: your not blocking the original event
[01:11:07] <Cork> event.preventDefault()
[01:11:26] <hxm> where, in the callPage()?
[01:11:38] <Cork> also i don't see anything to handle submit events
[01:12:50] <hxm> thanks, you showed me the light
[01:14:46] <IamTrying> How do i exit the loop? e.g: $('.os').each(function(i){ if ($(this).prop('checked')) {yesno = true;}});
[01:14:54] <IamTrying> when yesno=true i mean
[01:15:33] <rethus> see "continue"
[01:15:54] <rethus> ah sorry, i thougt i was in #php
[01:16:13] <Cork> IamTrying: return false;
[01:16:20] <rethus> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17162334/how-to-use-continue-in-jquery-each-loop
[01:17:53] <IamTrying> OK - thank you Guru Cork
[01:38:02] <fattest> I'm trying to get my show hide to work for my table, but nothing happens when i click on the row! It works for my button. Please help! http://jsfiddle.net/tS6G2/11/
[01:41:34] <Cork> fattest: http://jsfiddle.net/tS6G2/12/
[01:41:55] <Cork> fattest: biggest problem is that you tried to have a div as a child to a tr
[01:42:05] <Cork> tr can only have td and th as children
[01:42:38] <Cork> fattest: but you also want to delegate the event handler to the table, so you don't have to bind it on every row
[01:45:52] <fattest> Cork: thank you so much
[01:47:44] <fattest> Cork: is it possible to test content under the table rows instead of a new column?
[01:47:58] <fattest> i wanted the sliding effect
[01:48:08] <Cork> .next() ?
[01:48:34] <Cork> you need to have <tr><td column="2"></td></tr> for that though
[01:48:57] <fattest> ok
[01:52:08] <fattest> Cork: when you use .next, do you give content class to <tr> or create another div?
[01:52:57] <Cork> fattest: http://jsfiddle.net/tS6G2/12/
[01:53:06] <Cork> opps
[01:53:11] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/tS6G2/17/
[01:53:14] <Cork> missed to save
[01:53:26] <Cork> >_<'
[01:53:31] <Cork> and saved the wrong tab...
[01:53:33] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/tS6G2/18/
[01:53:51] <fattest> haha
[01:54:00] <Cork> the reason you need the extra div is cause overflow doesn't work for td
[01:54:33] <fattest> Cork: this is the seventh time you helped me; thank you very much!
[01:55:03] <fattest> Cork: did you make jquery?
[01:55:51] <Cork> fattest: lol no
[02:10:57] <hxm> hi in $("#id").on("submit", function(here) { i can know the action="this" and the arguments to send?
[02:11:05] <hxm> exists as argument?
[02:11:26] <Cork> this.action
[02:11:39] <Cork> and $(this).serialize()
[02:11:51] <Cork> or serializeArray
[02:11:57] <Cork> ?api serialize
[02:11:57] <b-ot> Cork: .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[02:11:59] <Cork> ?api serializeArray
[02:12:02] <b-ot> Cork: .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[02:12:11] <hxm> ah, nice, thanks
[02:12:26] <hxm> you could put your paypal account in the topic Cork, you deserve it
[02:13:04] <fattest> Cork: I know that youre not familiar with this plugin (angularJS), but can you please have a look and try identify why the show hide isn't working on this? http://plnkr.co/edit/lE8JKkaUrOQCvcWuYz8M?p=preview
[02:13:31] <Cork> fattest: uhh user a better pb
[02:13:35] <Cork> *use
[02:13:41] <fattest> pb?
[02:13:46] <Cork> pastebin
[02:13:53] <fattest> do you prefer jsfiddle?
[02:13:56] <Cork> jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com is two examples
[02:14:03] <fattest> ok
[02:14:05] <Cork> fattest: one that isn't broken and i'
[02:14:09] <Cork> *'m ok
[02:14:13] <fattest> ok
[02:21:34] <fattest> Cork: apologies for the time, but i've got it here http://jsbin.com/moxenoci/2/edit I don't know where to add the <tr content> because of the ng repeat in the previous tr (which repeats <tr> depending on the quantity of row) Can you please have a look? http://jsbin.com/moxenoci/2/edit
[02:21:42] <fattest> didn't mean to copy link twice
[02:23:37] <Cork> fattest: if you can't add it as a new tr
[02:24:06] <Cork> you basically only have one choice, and that is to put it at the end of one of the tds
[02:24:29] <Cork> fattest: do you want it to push apart the table, or should it be anywhere else?
[02:24:58] <fattest> end of the tds will make a new column right?
[02:25:07] <Cork> doesn't have to
[02:25:46] <fattest> the one in your first fiddle made a new td http://jsfiddle.net/tS6G2/12/
[02:25:56] <fattest> made a column *
[02:27:34] <fattest> Cork: with this updated one, http://jsbin.com/moxenoci/2/edit will it be possible to make a show hide with animate under the table row?
[02:28:52] <fattest> Cork: i think jquery and AngularJS are mixing up. Perhaps i should attempt to learn the show hide function in angular js?
[02:30:42] <Cork> fattest: something like this? http://jsbin.com/moxenoci/3/edit
[02:31:49] <fattest> Cork: it made a new column though...i will have over 10 columns therefore, i want it to come under the row. Do you think this is possible?
[02:32:07] <Cork> it's doable, but a bit harder
[02:33:11] <fattest> Cork: i understand that you have no experience with angularJs, i'll have a look from my end and see if i can fix this
[02:33:32] <Cork> fattest: this isn't really about angular
[02:33:43] <fattest> oh
[02:35:34] <Cork> hmm no that wont work...
[02:37:21] <Cork> fattest: hmm looks like i have to take that back
[02:37:40] <Cork> fattest: only way you could do it with the sorting function is if you can group rows
[02:38:02] <Cork> fattest: so ya, deeper knowledge into angular is needed
[02:39:48] <Cork> fattest: best i can come up with is http://jsbin.com/moxenoci/3/edit
[02:39:52] <Cork> and that isn't really good at all
[02:40:10] <Cork> hmm wait a min...
[02:40:38] <Cork> heh
[02:40:47] <Cork> fattest: works now
[02:40:49] <Cork> http://jsbin.com/moxenoci/3/edit
[02:41:11] <Cork> it is a bit hacky
[02:41:13] <Cork> but it works
[02:48:17] <Ualidus> thanks for yesterday, I have a solution now... See you next time :)
[02:49:31] <fattest> Cork: you are the best! Thank you so much
[02:49:49] <hxm> is this correct?  $("#content").on("submit", function() { var f = $(this).closest("form");alert(f.id);
[02:49:51] <hxm> i get undefined
[02:49:58] <hxm> inside #content exists a form
[02:50:02] <fattest> Cork: what's with the warning?
[02:50:13] <Cork> hxm: you want .find not .closest
[02:50:20] <Cork> fattest: what warning?
[02:51:14] <fattest> Cork: "    Line 7: {name:'Julie', phone:'555-8765', age:29}] --- Missing semicolon."
[02:51:47] <Cork> ah that
[02:51:56] <Cork> exactly what it says :)
[02:52:06] <Cork> there is a ; missing before  $scope.predicate
[02:52:13] <Cork> http://jsbin.com/moxenoci/8/edit
[02:52:28] <Cork> fattest: though js doesn't really care so...
[02:52:36] <Cork> just pedantic
[02:53:01] <fattest> Cork: thanks... should I care by the term 'hacky?"
[02:53:35] <Cork> fattest: well the biggest problem is that the overflow span needs to set the height the content need
[02:53:55] <Cork> and that is cause the content is position: absolute;
[02:54:09] <Cork> in order for it to be able to cross the columns borders
[02:54:19] <fattest> oh
[02:58:07] <jdo_dk> This works: $('#datepick').datepicker('option', 'maxDate', '1'); but when using a popup and trying this: window.opener.$('#datepick').datepicker('option', 'maxDate', '1'); it does not work. Am i missing something ?
[02:59:20] <jdo_dk> This gives me a "data" in console: window.opener.$("#slutdato_show")
[03:00:37] <jdo_dk> Nevermind. It works. :)
[03:00:45] <jdo_dk> was a typo.
[03:26:46] <abailarri> Hello. I'm writting a drupal module that contains some js functions. In one function I have .get() request, but how can I know is there is any response?
[03:26:58] <onur> Hi. I have a object created with var myobj = $.parseHTML (...) Now I want to use this object in my underscore template. It prints [object HTMLParagraphElement] in my page and $(myobj).html() returns undefined. How can I convert myobj to html string?
[03:27:15] <Cork> abailarri: use the .done and .fail callback
[03:27:54] <Cork> onur: why are you parsing the html if you want html?
[03:28:18] <Cork> anyway $(myobj).html() should return the content of the outer elements
[03:28:25] <Cork> but not those elements
[03:28:28] <onur> because I am changing some tags and content in that
[03:28:30] <onur> html
[03:28:41] <onur> but it returns undefined Cork
[03:28:53] <Cork> $('<div>').append(myobj).html() should give you the html
[03:29:41] <onur> I tried that let me try again but it also returns <div>undefined</div>
[03:30:24] <onur> yea same
[03:30:52] <Cork> onur: check your spelling of the variable names then
[03:31:08] <Cork> cause myobj would have to be undefined for that value
[03:33:01] <onur> omg yea I found the problem
[03:33:20] <onur> I was using this.content to use in my $.parseHTML instead of local content variable
[03:33:25] <onur> thanks Cork
[03:44:22] <onur> Cork: I have one more question. I was binding some click event to a tags in myobj. But this events doesn't trigger after I use $(myobj).html(). Is there a way to solve this?
[03:44:49] <Cork> onur: not easily
[03:45:04] <Cork> html isn't dom elements so you don't have event listeners
[03:45:27] <Cork> onur: only two options is to add them after you've converted them to dom again
[03:45:33] <Cork> or use delegated event listeners
[03:45:45] <Cork> and attache the event listeners to a static parent in the page
[03:55:19] <LLKCKfan> Is there a way to install a device software and make it stay installed? more info here pastebin.com/70Z5P5Yu along with scan shoots
[03:55:41] <Cork> LLKCKfan: i doubt your in the correct channel
[03:56:25] <LLKCKfan> There is none
[03:57:04] <Cork> LLKCKfan: in what way would device software have anything to do with jquery?
[04:05:07] <NicholasC> LLKCKfan, you'd be better off asking in the channel of the OS you're trying to do this on. Since you're working with Device Manager, try #windows or #microsoft
[04:08:43] <beancurd> 1haha.
[04:10:34] <LLKCKfan> Cannot join or send
[04:14:37] <NicholasC> LLKCKfan, you have to register a nick first, as the channel redirect says..
[04:15:16] <LLKCKfan> I cannot get into window with a register nick
[04:16:15] <NicholasC> I don't know what you're doing wrong then, I can join #windows just fine with a registered nick.
[04:17:07] <Cork> LLKCKfan: your nick isn't registered
[04:20:10] <DeafGoose> whats the difference between [Object { name="test".....}] and Object { name="test"...} notice the brackets..Im doing some debuging w console.log
[04:20:29] <Cork> DeafGoose: the first one is wrapped in an array
[04:20:39] <LLKCKfan> I cannot
[04:20:45] <DeafGoose> hmm i see
[04:21:24] <Cork> DeafGoose: it might also be wrapped in jquery as it shows like an array
[04:21:58] <DeafGoose> Im trying to rewrite the object with brackets but im being unsuccessful
[04:22:16] <Cork> variable[0].name
[04:22:16] <NicholasC> LLKCKfan, you're still not registered.
[04:22:37] <NicholasC> Or at the very least, not logged in.
[04:22:39] <Cork> LLKCKfan: if you need help goto #freenode
[04:22:52] <Cork> this is offtopic here
[04:23:16] <DeafGoose> cool Cork
[04:23:28] <NicholasC> Which is preferred Syntax: function funcName (val1, val2) {  or funcName = function (val1,val2) { ?
[04:23:44] <Cork> NicholasC: not much difference
[04:24:00] <Cork> if you plan of passing the function to something you might want to use the second
[04:24:06] <Cork> but it really doesn't matter
[04:24:09] <NicholasC> Cork: So, purely aesthetics?
[04:24:14] <Cork> no
[04:24:32] <Cork> the first one is a statement
[04:24:40] <Cork> so it is hoisted to the beginning of the function
[04:24:49] <Cork> the second has to be defined before you use the variable
[04:24:58] <Cork> also the second one should have var infront of it
[04:25:10] <Cork> else you will create a global variable
[04:25:43] <NicholasC> Alright, thanks.
[04:25:53] <NicholasC> That explanation makes sense
[04:57:13] <lite_> hi. so looking through a bunch of old legacy code there is a pleathora of listeners set up like this : $(document).on('click', '.fooClass, function() {}. This seems very cumbersome as this click handler seems to be triggered on every click within document, or am i misunderstanding ?
[04:58:07] <Cork> lite_: yes and no
[04:58:19] <Cork> lite_: internally it adds an event listener for everything on the page
[04:58:32] <Cork> but it then checks if the click came from the selector
[04:58:54] <jamieshepherd> Hi guys, I need to limit the response of the Jquery UI autocomplete (pulls from XML) to 5 results... My current code: http://jsfiddle.net/pxDgP/
[04:59:13] <lite_> but whats the difference between this and simply having it set up like this : $('.fooClass').on('click' ?
[04:59:15] <Cork> lite_: if you have a long list of $(document).on('event', 'selector', func) you most likely have a site that has been using .live and it has been straight converted
[04:59:26] <lite_> Cork:  uip.
[04:59:28] <lite_> yup*
[04:59:31] <Cork> lite_: the first one will catch dynamically created elements
[04:59:40] <lite_> ah
[04:59:45] <Cork> while the second will add one event listener to every element that exist
[04:59:45] <lite_> thats it then
[04:59:49] <Cork> if it doesn't no listener
[05:00:23] <Cork> lite_: if you want to optimize it you can move the listener to a static parent closer to the dynamic one
[05:01:00] <Cork> jamieshepherd: uh.. why not limit that server side?
[05:01:08] <jamieshepherd> It's an XML file
[05:01:08] <Cork> is kinda pointless to do it client side
[05:01:12] <intellilogic> I want to actuate something with ajax updates on the page, I am using $.ajax, is there some way I can call a function when it's called w/o having to put code in each call?
[05:01:24] <jamieshepherd> It's not an SQL request
[05:01:48] <Cork> you could still limit it server side
[05:02:36] <jamieshepherd> http://jsfiddle.net/andrewwhitaker/vqwBP/ this response slice line looks good, but can't seem to get it to work with the xml ;o
[05:03:18] <intellilogic> Anything triggered from $.ajax that I can use elsewhere in my code?
[05:04:14] <Cork> intellilogic: there is an event you can listen for on document
[05:04:28] <Cork> but it won't have the data
[05:04:58] <intellilogic> Cork, that's ok, I don't need the data
[05:05:01] <intellilogic> What is it?

[05:30:18] <murosai> is there any hacky way to read httponly cookies on client side?
[05:39:50] <KamiNuvini> murosai: I think that would defeat the purpose :)
[05:43:02] <murosai> at least one way is to send ajax request and read the response headers but that won't work on all browsers
[05:48:35] <MikeD_> if it's your own cookie, turn off httponly.  if it's not your own cookie, then it's (technically) none of your business, right?
[05:52:20] <ddssc> is there a jquery twitter library that can subscribe to specified tweets and handle new tweets accordingly?
[05:56:50] <Jattenalle> ddssc, https://plugins.jquery.com/tag/twitter/ no, absolutely not.
[06:17:38] <Bui_> hi! anyone know of any jquery plugins that act similar to the troubleshooter guide thing google has? hard to explain, but it's something like this: https://support.google.com/accounts/troubleshooter/2402620
[06:22:20] <serg_> hi! Is there a reverse operation to jquery-ui position({of: el}) one? i.e. if I have an element $el, which was previously positioned against some element $z, can I get that information (element it was positioned against) based on $el only?
[06:25:32] <ddssc> is there a jquery twitter library that can subscribe to specified tweets and handle new tweets accordingly?
[06:25:51] <Jattenalle> ddssc, https://plugins.jquery.com/tag/twitter/ no, absolutely not. deja vu?
[06:33:48] <ddssc> Jattenalle: my question was specific , your answer was not.
[06:38:56] <effortDee_> hi. i have a carousel on the home page and it is in jquery, it has a left and right arrow and it's sat beneath the main menu,when i click on the main menu it has a drop down and this sits over the arrow left for the slideshow and the arrow sits abiocve the sub menu
[06:39:03] <effortDee_> will z index fix this?
[06:42:39] <Jattenalle> ddssc, no i actually dont think there is any, your question is fairly vague though
[06:43:06] <Jattenalle> ddssc, it sounds like you want to show a twitter feed? that auto-updates if there's a new tweet?
[06:43:24] <Jattenalle> (ie: checks every so often for new tweets and refreshes the feed?)
[06:43:39] <Jattenalle> if so, just use a twitter feed thing, and set a timeout to refresh it, at like once a minute or somesuch
[06:45:56] <ddssc> Jattenalle:  I need to be able to recieve all feeds for #foo . so if you tweet #foo I'd get it in the stream along with other info, who tweeted it when where etc
[06:46:17] <Jattenalle> oh, hm
[07:16:09] <computer2000> anyone can help me with a isotope.js problem
[07:16:34] <computer2000> its about appending items and the layoutcomplete event
[07:41:31] <abailarri> Hello. I have a question. I putted a console.log(nameofonefunction) and I see this in the console: Object { content_de_prueba="content_de_prueba", segunda_content_de_prueba="segunda_content_de_prueba"}. What is this? Is an array?
[07:42:11] <wunz> that is what the fucntion returned, an object
[07:43:12] <abailarri> ok. Now I want to add a css class to a div that hava the name atttribte same as content of the object. Waht is the best way?
[07:43:52] <abailarri> for example div class"some" attrribute="content_de_prueba">
[07:44:02] <abailarri> then to this div add a class
[07:44:22] <abailarri> because the attr. name is tha same that object content
[08:02:26] <aton`> i am using $("*").keydown() to create hotkeys. for most of the page they work, while text inputs and textareas are not affected. but one textarea is affected, i cannot type the hotkeys there. how can that be?
[08:02:26] <FatBoyXPC> is there any fix for the jquery mobile swipe issue on chrome for android? I'm on a nexus 4 with up to date chrome 34.0.1847.114 and android 4.4.2
[08:03:08] <abailarri> I have this script http://jsfiddle.net/8qHC3/, but in the console log I only see the first attribute, not the three
[08:05:36] <BillCriswell> abailarri: I'm not seeing anything.
[08:05:55] <BillCriswell> Well, besides undefined.
[08:06:04] <abailarri> how?
[08:06:35] <BillCriswell> Because your selector doesn't match any elements.
[08:08:29] <abailarri> BillCriswell, http://jsfiddle.net/8qHC3/1/
[08:09:04] <abailarri> with this in the console I only see "content"
[08:09:21] <abailarri> "de" and "prueba" I not see in the log
[08:10:36] <FatBoyXPC> BillCriswell: you by chance know about the jquery mobile swipe issue on chrome for android?

[08:15:33] <BillCriswell> abailarri: It doesn't really work like that. You'd have to loop through each item and add it to an array (or use something like .map).
[08:16:07] <abailarri> BillCriswell, can you show me an example?
[08:16:35] <BillCriswell> abailarri: http://jsfiddle.net/8qHC3/3/
[08:16:48] <BillCriswell> FatBoyXPC: I am not familiar with that.
[08:17:00] <FatBoyXPC> BillCriswell: ah, thanks.
[08:31:26] <SprkDev> This is driving me crazy. Everything was working fine, out of nowheere stopped working.
[08:31:55] <abailarri> exists any function to convert a object to an array?
[08:32:00] <_lazarevsky> hello all
[08:32:00] <SprkDev> giving me a JSON.parse : unexpected chracter error in firebug.
[08:32:04] <abailarri> is for compare two arrays
[08:32:18] <_lazarevsky> I have a datepicker
[08:32:24] <_lazarevsky> and am doing on validations thru the plugin
[08:32:29] <NicholasC> SprkDev, welcome to the wonderful world of programming! That error usually means something changed in the response you're getting in. Usually that it's not valid JSON.
[08:32:41] <_lazarevsky> however I wanna handle the scenarios when the user change the values of the input field (datepicker) thru the console
[08:32:49] <NicholasC> SprkDev, you could do a console.log on the stuff you're trying to parse and check if it's valid JSON.
[08:32:58] <_lazarevsky> I tried to handle that event in .on('change') and .on('input')
[08:33:11] <_lazarevsky> in the console i say $(element).val('asdasdasdas')
[08:33:15] <_lazarevsky> and neither of those events fire :/
[08:33:15] <SprkDev> but why would it suddenly stop working. Hardly changed anythign at all.
[08:33:47] <_lazarevsky> anyone? please help :)
[08:33:56] <NicholasC> SprkDev, well, how are you generating the JSON? That's probably what changed. Regardless, I couldn't tell without seeing your code. And remember, hardly anything is still something.
[08:34:05] <BillCriswell> abailarri: Look through it, add it to an array.
[08:34:22] <SprkDev> I just added css style
[08:34:50] <Ant1> Is there a way to make the spinner HTML5 compliant? The example given here http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/spinner/default.html is invalid because the input has not type. But if setting the type, the validator is complaining that role spinbutton is invalid.
[08:35:10] <NicholasC> _lazarevsky, first: Patience. Second: I don't think you can filter for that. Just catch it at the serverside. You should always do serverside verification anyway.
[08:35:27] <NicholasC> SprkDev, That's all I can tell you without seeing your code.
[08:35:39] <_lazarevsky> yea of course I do do that
[08:35:41] <BillCriswell> abailarri: s/look/loop
[08:35:52] <_lazarevsky> I will normalise the data if needed on the serverside
[08:36:03] <_lazarevsky> but the values of the textboxes will not be updated
[08:36:16] <_lazarevsky> boom!
[08:36:23] <_lazarevsky> I just figured out how to solve the problem!
[08:36:29] <_lazarevsky> NicholasC: you just got rubberducked!
[08:36:30] <_lazarevsky> :DD
[08:36:32] <_lazarevsky> thanks man!
[08:37:06] <NicholasC> Eh. Right.
[08:45:42] <Ant1> Is there a way to make the spinner HTML5 compliant? The example given here http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/spinner/default.html is invalid because the input has not type. But if setting the type to text, the validator is complaining that role spinbutton is invalid.
[08:47:52] <abailarri> BillCriswell, I tried but see: http://jsfiddle.net/8qHC3/4/
[08:48:08] <duch_kazatel> whuddup folks
[08:49:11] <hesco> This line works fine to show and hide content appropriately when my webform is initially rendered:
[08:49:13] <hesco> $('div#list_options [type=radio]:not(:checked)').change( function() {
[08:49:15] <hesco> however if invalid data is kicked back requiring the form to be completed, all is hidden except for the #list_options div, until I again change the value.  The desired behavior is that the form elements remain show(n) permitting them to be corrected and resubmitted.  How might I do that, please?
[08:49:40] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ hesco
[08:49:40] <b-ot> hesco: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:50:06] <hesco> b-ot: thank you, coming at you in a moment
[08:50:17] <duch_kazatel> hesco that was a bot ;)
[08:50:20] <BillCriswell> abailarri: What is Drupal.settings.park_map.types ?
[08:50:37] <abailarri> is function that returns an object
[08:50:54] <hesco> duch_kazatel: of course, thanks
[08:51:16] <hesco> I see that was you who sent that my way
[08:51:25] <duch_kazatel> yep :)
[08:52:02] <BillCriswell> abailarri: So you're expecting tipos_conf to be an object there?
[08:53:06] <abailarri> BillCriswell, I want to convert tipos_conf object to an array like the last comment
[08:53:46] <duch_kazatel> did abailarri give us an example of the original data?
[08:54:04] <ankurk_> How can I check the occurance of second comma in this string? "Brian Veerman, Orest Holyk, Chuck Diehl, Joe Cirincione"?
[08:54:09] <abailarri> duch_kazatel, what original data?
[08:54:12] <ankurk_> String can actually
[08:54:16] <ankurk_> *change
[08:54:24] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ a regular expression.
[08:54:39] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: What do you mean check it? Like see if there's two or more?
[08:54:42] <duch_kazatel> abailarri it looks like you want to convert an object into an array - is that right?
[08:54:57] <abailarri> yes duch_kazatel
[08:55:25] <duch_kazatel> abailarri it's hard to help you do that if we don't know what the original object looks like.
[08:55:27] <hesco> duch_kazatel: As requested.  Though it seems somehow broken here: http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=FmSqhdInKA
[08:55:43] <ankurk_> BillCriswell: Bingo, I want to hide more than two full names
[08:55:52] <abailarri> duch_kazatel, do you se the comments? http://jsfiddle.net/8qHC3/4/
[08:56:11] <abailarri> the first comment is the object
[08:56:53] <duch_kazatel> ah, sorry abailarri.  i see now.
[08:56:58] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: I'd probably do like var nameList = names.split(', '); then I'd have a nice array to work with.
[08:57:17] <BillCriswell> I can get two by doing like... nameList.slice(0, 2).join(', ');
[08:58:16] <duch_kazatel> abailarri btw that format is invalid.
[08:58:30] <duch_kazatel> that's not a valid object.
[08:58:42] <duch_kazatel> I will correct it so it is.
[08:58:43] <abailarri> oooohh
[08:59:10] <abailarri> then, how can I obtain  tipos_conf2 like last comment sintax?
[08:59:20] <duch_kazatel> i'm showing you.
[08:59:42] <duch_kazatel> abailarri http://jsfiddle.net/8qHC3/5/
[08:59:46] <duch_kazatel> this is one way
[09:01:10] <duch_kazatel> hesco without seeing the response, it's hard to know what's going on, but I will point out that you need to abstract a little better.  you're replicating 90% of your functionality in your different change handlers.
[09:02:10] <hesco> I fixed the form action on the jsfiddle paste and it should now work, though perhaps I need to disable the CSFR validation piece
[09:02:26] <duch_kazatel> hesco http://jsfiddle.net/eg4d5/
[09:02:39] <duch_kazatel> also, jsfiddle doesn't like body or html tags.
[09:02:39] <hesco> and to see it in my UAT environment, you can go to:  http://fyeo.thefamilyconnector.com:8009/concierge/application
[09:03:18] <duch_kazatel> also, selectors like $('div#list_options [type=radio]:not(:checked)') are slow.
[09:04:27] <hesco> duch_kazatel: I just added an external link to my css, which makes things a bit easier to sort out
[09:04:34] <krambiorix> hi, when clicking a button i want to know if thata button is a child of a div with class "mydiv" ... How can i do that?
[09:04:46] <duch_kazatel> hesco fix up your selectors and stuff first.
[09:05:07] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix check the .parents('.mydiv') and go from there.
[09:06:46] <duch_kazatel> hesco keep in mind that $('div#list_options [type=radio]:not(:checked)').change( will only run its bindings once btw - after the page loads, it won't "re-run" the selector to find things to bind to.
[09:07:13] <BillCriswell> if ($button.closest('.mydiv').length) can work I think?
[09:07:44] <duch_kazatel> i'd check out using event delegation and looking at the .prop() method also, because radio boxes aren't technically "checked" anyway
[09:08:04] <hesco> duch_kazatel:  thanks, that is a useful clue.  How would I make it re-run when the page is reloaded with the validation errors, then?
[09:08:27] <duch_kazatel> hesco don't.  instead, use event delegation and check your criteria inside of your handler..
[09:08:57] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: http://jsbin.com/yeqariyo/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:09:36] <hesco> event delegation?  I'm really new to this jquery stuff.  This is actually my first jquery project.  Can you point me to some background reading please which will provide context for your advice?
[09:10:14] <duch_kazatel> that's actually a javascript concept, but jquery makes it easy.  Check out the docs for .on()
[09:10:23] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery .on()
[09:10:25] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .on() | jQuery API Documentation → https://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:10:37] <oal> I use getJSON('...?query='+string) but old versions of IE send some special characters incorrectly. Can I force it to be utf8?
[09:12:00] <duch_kazatel> oal huh? you're getting json there, not sending it.
[09:14:04] <oal> duch_kazatel, I meant the string in the URL. When the server receives it from IE, its garbage, other browsers is fine
[09:14:46] <duch_kazatel> ah - run an encodeURIComponent on it first imo.
[09:15:21] <oal> duch_kazatel, ah, perfect. :)
[09:15:23] <oal> thank you
[09:15:26] <duch_kazatel> !g mdn encodeURIComponent
[09:15:27] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: encodeURIComponent() - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent
[09:15:39] <duch_kazatel> that should help escape chars and make you feel saner overall.
[09:15:47] <oal> yes, it works now
[09:16:40] <duch_kazatel> radass
[09:16:50] <BillCriswell> asciiflow is awesome.
[09:17:00] <BillCriswell> http://asciiflow.com/ so much fun haha
[09:17:07] <duch_kazatel> hahahahaha
[09:17:08] <duch_kazatel> woah
[09:18:19] <BillCriswell> I could make my source comments look pretty bad ass with this.
[09:18:58] <duch_kazatel> you say that, but after having gone through code with comments like this, i'd have to tell you "be careful with that one"
[09:19:41] <BillCriswell> Haha yeah I know.
[09:19:50] <BillCriswell> I can't focus for shit today.
[09:20:42] <BillCriswell> Luckily I can get away with like... 2 30 minutes of pure focus a day.
[09:20:51] <BillCriswell> Which is usually enough.
[09:21:53] <duch_kazatel> i try to get most of my distractions out earlier in the day.
[09:22:25] <clueful> I'm trying out the try.jquery.com tutorial...I'm amazed by the quality of the instruction, it's great that such professional resources are available for free
[09:22:59] <duch_kazatel> clueful good!  the devs/maintainers will be happy to see that.
[09:24:41] <clueful> duch_kazatel: previously I was trying a bunch of more recent js mvc frameworks, and found that they were poorly documented and required lots of extra work on teh backend, jquery seems to be just enough help, without introducing too much abstraction
[09:25:19] <duch_kazatel> clueful just be aware that jquery serves a different purpose than, say, backbone or riot.  it's not an MVC framework.  hell, it's not really even a framework.
[09:26:05] <ankurk_> there should be a faq on whether jquery is a framework or not :P
[09:26:33] <duch_kazatel> from http://jquery.com/ - "jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library." :)
[09:27:09] <clueful> duch_kazatel: exactly!  I'm using a server-side mvc framework, and I found I was having to effectively replicate everything once in an api and then in the js mvc framework, really all I want is an easy way to make dynamic forms and do autocompletes...it seems like jquery is well-suited to that
[09:27:50] <duch_kazatel> yep.  jquery is a fantastic abstraction library.  just don't fall in the (very easy) trap of doing the wrong things client-side.
[09:31:43] <clueful> duch_kazatel: any particular pitfalls I should avoid?
[09:32:55] <duch_kazatel> cache calls to the constructor as much as possible.  learn and use event delegation.  if you find yourself writing big ugly selectors, just add a class or ID in your backend.
[09:34:10] <duch_kazatel> a pet peeve of mine is also being careful with .each() - it's powerful but can be very slow.
[09:38:51] <clueful> duch_kazatel: Thanks for the tips, I'll keep them in mind
[09:42:17] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[09:43:54] <duch_kazatel> today is one of those days where i really wish i could just sit at home and dick around on my guitar.
[09:44:47] <lericson> duch_kazatel: that's not what guitars are for
[09:44:59] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[09:47:06] <BillCriswell> I think Wednesday off would be great for the work week.
[09:47:20] <clueful> duch_kazatel: or just do a codeschool tutorial instead of working :)
[09:47:50] * BillCriswell wishes he worked 10 hour days instead of 8 hour days.
[09:50:42] <duch_kazatel> clueful nah i'm good on that front ;) i'm rewriting some validation on our frontend that originally had some... interesting stuff going on.
[09:51:35] <clueful> duch_kazatel: I'm an academic so this is fairly unrelated to my research and pretty much my equivalent to teaching myself guitar
[09:51:48] <duch_kazatel> hah.  fair enough.
[09:53:47] <ankurk_> BillCriswell: just 10 hour? I once worked for 13 hours :P
[09:54:15] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: I hope I never have to experience that.
[09:54:27] <nhulea> ladies and gentlemen welcome to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wednesday !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[09:54:52] <duch_kazatel> "once"
[09:54:53] <duch_kazatel> cute
[09:55:20] <duch_kazatel> long ago i worked nights doing data entry - for a few months i was pulling 16s 5 days a week.
[09:55:31] <ankurk_> this is a perk of being an intern actually :P
[09:55:37] <BillCriswell> I don't think I could do data entry.
[09:55:43] <ankurk_> me too
[09:55:45] <BillCriswell> I'd have to script something out.
[09:55:53] <nhulea> you should try its awesome !
[09:55:53] <duch_kazatel> we couldn't in our case.
[09:56:00] <duch_kazatel> newspapers.
[09:56:08] <BillCriswell> In that case I would set the place on fire.
[09:56:37] <duch_kazatel> yeah, we tried to automate a few things but it always wound up being better just doing it by hand.
[09:56:54] <duch_kazatel> well, most stuff.
[09:57:51] <BillCriswell> That's brutal.
[09:58:09] <BillCriswell> Speaking of brutal, watched a movie called "The Raid" last night. It was insane.
[09:58:10] <duch_kazatel> sadly enough, there's still a lot of money to burn in that industry.
[09:58:30] <duch_kazatel> isn't that an indonesian movie?
[09:58:46] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yes.
[10:01:04] <BillCriswell> For there being maybe 5 minutes of dialog it was a pretty awesome story.
[10:01:28] <duch_kazatel> that's awesome.
[10:01:28] <BillCriswell> Intelligent too for the most part.
[10:02:01] <duch_kazatel> aaand now the office funnyman is running around in a tutu
[10:02:16] <BillCriswell> I still prefer less guns I think. I love the Tony Jaa movies.
[10:02:23] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha nice. We don't have one of those.
[10:02:31] <duch_kazatel> you need one.
[10:03:36] <BillCriswell> I should finish my gulp-notes thingy.
[10:06:31] <nhulea> whoa I am wearing a tutu also ...
[10:07:29] <BillCriswell> nhulea: I'm sure it's out of the norm for the funny guy, though.
[10:07:41] <nhulea> yeah for sure
[10:07:50] <nhulea> easy joke for sure
[10:08:02] <nhulea> or not so easy haha
[10:08:15] <BillCriswell> I'm only capable of obvious jokes.
[10:08:21] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[10:09:47] <nhulea> genius!
[10:09:49] <zagaza`> can someone help me figure out why the masonry breaks when I press the "about" page and go back to home? http://danielnikolovski.com/   and here is how I have initialized masonry http://pastebin.com/SB1HxKJd
[10:13:18] <duch_kazatel> til jquery provides a utility "nothing" function: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.noop/
[10:14:32] <BinaryKitten> awesome.
[10:26:06] <BillCriswell> Switching from libsass to ruby sass is brutal.
[10:27:40] <Fatalnix> I read somewhere that ready() was a great time to do the resizing of misbehaving div's .. and it works great! Except when I refresh the browser, they become even more screwed up. If I directly punch in the address and hit enter, it works fine. We think it may be the images that are loading at work that might be screwing it up but I was just wondering- what is a usual cause for this?
[10:29:07] <BillCriswell> Not sure what you mean by misbehaving Fatalnix.
[10:29:58] <Fatalnix> BillCriswell: if you'd like me to provide an example, I could pm the link if you'd like BillCriswell to get an idea. I just didn't want a lot of hits to the website at the moment since we're trying to deal with some load issues.
[10:30:44] <duch_kazatel> Fatalnix can you setup a simple use case in jsfiddle?
[10:31:49] <duch_kazatel> because it sounds like you're doing something with dynamically sizing content based on images.
[10:33:44] <bberry> if i wanted to determine if an html element exists via ID, how would i do that with an if statement.  i.e. if($("#foo")){ // do stuff }
[10:34:13] <duch_kazatel> if ($('#foo').length)
[10:34:28] <BillCriswell> That question is asked at least 10 times a week in there.
[10:34:35] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[10:34:47] <bberry> haha
[10:34:51] <duch_kazatel> and i'll bet at least half of those cases they don't actually need to check.
[10:35:03] <bberry> okay, thats what i had, just wanted to make sure that it was correct
[10:35:17] <bberry> and there wasnt some jquery function that was awesome
[10:35:42] <bberry> like $.exists('#foo') or something
[10:36:09] <duch_kazatel> most of the time you don't actually need to check for existence, which is nice.
[10:36:42] <bberry> yeah. im just doing it because im looping through objects where the key values of the properties are parts of IDs in html
[10:37:28] <duch_kazatel> interesting.
[10:37:57] <bberry> so like var foo = {'test':5}; for(prop in foo){ $("#"+prop).val(foo[prop]); }
[10:38:30] <duch_kazatel> ah and you don't want to throw an error on that .val()
[10:38:35] <bberry> yepyep
[10:38:47] <duch_kazatel> fyi .val() checks first for you ;)
[10:38:53] <duch_kazatel> making that redundant
[10:39:03] <Fatalnix> it's being based off the size of other divs. we just happen to think that somehow maybe the images are loading after the divs are resized or something weird. It seems to load fine if I run it in jsfiddle and I can't get the issue to recreate in it.
[10:39:53] <duch_kazatel> Fatalnix interesting.  have you considered moving the resize stuff into $( window ).on('load', function(){  }); instead?
[10:40:09] <duch_kazatel> that'll wait for all all resources to finish loading instead.
[10:40:17] <Fatalnix> that event fires after ready?
[10:40:25] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[10:40:29] <bberry> duch_kazatel: interesting! good to know. actually im editing old code, and you made me notice that im doing bad things haha. im doing stuff like $("#foo")[0].value
[10:40:32] <Fatalnix> hmm, I was wondering about that.
[10:40:49] <koze> say i have a website with 15 pages
[10:40:56] <duch_kazatel> bberry $("#foo")[0].value that is totally unnecessary.
[10:41:08] <koze> i'm trying to analyze where a css selector is used
[10:41:21] <BillCriswell> Fatalnix: Put img { max-width: 100%; } in your CSS. That would help figure out that situation.
[10:41:21] <koze> any thoughts on how i should crawl and analyze these pages?
[10:41:22] <duch_kazatel> $("#foo").value would be more approrpriate.
[10:41:53] <Fatalnix> BillCriswell: huh, never thought of that
[10:42:01] <Fatalnix> neat trick :)
[10:42:25] <BillCriswell> Haha, hopefully!
[10:42:54] <BillCriswell> koze: Is this a site you're building?
[10:43:18] <koze> BillCriswell: a site i inherited
[10:43:48] <BillCriswell> koze: If they're static pages why not just do a project wide search?
[10:44:22] <koze> BillCriswell: I'm thinking I have to crawl each page and use a css parser to check if the css rule is used on a page or not
[10:44:23] <duch_kazatel> i'll bet he has cases like #aDiv li li span ul a
[10:44:44] <koze> I first thought this was a jQ conversation, but perhaps only tangentially related
[10:44:46] <duch_kazatel> koze there's a firebug plugin called CSS Usage that might be of use.
[10:44:55] <BillCriswell> koze: Ah.
[10:45:00] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel:  Ah*
[10:48:17] <BillCriswell> koze: http://pastie.org/pastes/9056884/text reall quick hack job for it... might work?
[10:48:38] <BillCriswell> koze: Not tested, at all.
[10:49:53] <koze> BillCriswell: ah that's cool
[10:50:06] <BillCriswell> koze: MAYBE. Total stab.
[10:50:24] <koze> so just issue a bunch of ajax requests and somehow jangle a jquery() function targeting the response
[10:50:40] <bberry> duch_kazatel: haha i know... this was written in my early days of noobishness
[10:50:52] <koze> but...that won't spider. hmm.
[10:51:50] <BillCriswell> What do you mean by spider?
[10:51:54] <duch_kazatel> koze you could build in a spider for it.
[10:52:10] <BillCriswell> I don't even understand what that means lol
[10:52:11] <koze> BillCriswell: spider/crawler
[10:52:25] <duch_kazatel> he doesn't want to have to define all the pages to hit.
[10:52:28] <koze> find urls on the main page to other pages in the site, and recursively go through them
[10:52:44] <BillCriswell> Ah, he said there was 15 pages.
[10:52:50] <duch_kazatel> koze, you'd have to parse out any anchors, grab the href, and add it to an array if it doesn't all ready exist,
[10:53:01] <duch_kazatel> still have to give it an initial file though.
[10:53:06] <nhulea> hey any of you guys ever use http://80legs.com/ ?
[10:53:12] <koze> duch_kazatel: BillCriswell cool thanks dudes
[10:53:24] <BillCriswell> nhulea: I barely use 2.
[10:53:25] <BillCriswell> HAA
[10:53:33] <duch_kazatel> nhulea i avoid places that reference "Web-Scale Technology
[10:53:34] <nhulea> ba dum dum !
[10:53:39] <BillCriswell> koze: No problem
[10:54:06] <nhulea> yeah I was going to try and scrape to get images of a certain kind
[10:54:09] <BillCriswell> Do web developers think up these terms or is it the responsibility of a suit to come up with that shit?
[10:54:20] <nhulea> suit Id say
[10:54:29] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell i'll bet half the time it's a marketing chump,.
[10:54:35] <duch_kazatel> nhulea what kind of images?
[10:54:53] <nhulea> I guess images of eyes and mouths or faces sorta
[10:55:06] <duch_kazatel> GIS it?
[10:55:45] <nhulea> its kinda of about internet versions of images so its kinda has to be alot to show like vastness whats gis ?
[10:55:51] <nhulea> google image search
[10:55:55] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[10:56:14] <nhulea> is there an api for that ?
[10:56:32] <duch_kazatel> https://developers.google.com/image-search/v1/devguide
[10:56:56] <nhulea> oh wow cool
[10:57:08] <nhulea> looks pretty good
[10:58:20] <nhulea> I wonder if its possible to download images I guess maybe put them in a canvas datatourl them but maybe I can do it another way
[10:58:36] <Fishbowne2> anyone know why jquery draggable doesn't work on mobile ?
[10:58:46] <Fishbowne2> and whats a good workaround ?
[10:59:07] <bberry> Fishbowne2: jquery ui doesnt have touch events
[10:59:31] <bberry> Fishbowne2: theres some shim you can add that supposedly fixes it. cant remember the site.
[10:59:48] <bberry> Fishbowne2: http://touchpunch.furf.com/
[11:00:45] <duch_kazatel> the browser has touch events though.
[11:00:49] <duch_kazatel> you can bind to those.
[11:00:58] <duch_kazatel> aaaah nevermind.
[11:01:02] <duch_kazatel> i see what you're saying.
[11:01:03] <bberry> lol
[11:05:05] <duch_kazatel> hahaha one of my jellow devs injectes some js with a happy birthday message for me.
[11:06:54] <BillCriswell> jellow?
[11:08:41] <BillCriswell> Duh, nevermind.
[11:09:18] <duch_kazatel> *fellow.  derp der
[11:09:46] <BillCriswell> My mind went straight to "Jello"
[11:10:04] <BillCriswell> Which sounds like some trendy for thing to code in for a few days.
[11:10:14] <BillCriswell> s/for//
[11:12:21] <ankurk_> Happy Birthday duch_kazatel *beers*
[11:13:54] <disappearedng> Hey does jquery have a function that converts $('<div>').text('hello') to <div>hello</div>?
[11:14:08] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:14:20] <disappearedng> I am trying to change this function to append a button to it  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/28b6ec3af803208d3980
[11:14:32] <disappearedng> but unfortunately this is just string manipulation and not jquery
[11:14:48] <disappearedng> I am trying to add line 9
[11:15:23] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/HPbLp/
[11:15:38] <duch_kazatel> $('<div>').text('hello') creates a div and adds a text node to it.
[11:16:06] <duch_kazatel> which is basically what you're looking for, so your question seems kind of strange.
[11:16:39] <disappearedng> I think u misunderstood what I want to do. https://github.com/alfajango/jquery-dynatable/blob/master/jquery.dynatable.js line 287
[11:16:54] <disappearedng> I need to override this function and this function returns a string
[11:17:00] <disappearedng> I am trying to inject a button to the end of it
[11:17:32] <disappearedng> if I use tr += button, I get <td>asda</td>....[object Object]
[11:17:54] <disappearedng> cause invoking .toString() on any jquery object will just result in [object Object]
[11:17:57] <duch_kazatel> right, because button neets to be a string.  so pass it one.
[11:18:21] <duch_kazatel> you can't magically convert $('<div>').text('hello') to <div>hello</div> as far as i'm aware.
[11:18:31] <BillCriswell> disappearedng: You could maybe use button[0].outerHTML for that? This seems sloppy though.
[11:19:02] <BillCriswell> The whole process I mean, not .outerHTML
[11:19:14] <duch_kazatel> deal with strings instead.
[11:19:44] <disappearedng> well ok I can use strings, but then I will still want to attach a call handler to the button on click to do something
[11:19:56] <disappearedng> I have this now:         tr += '<td><button>hello</button></td>';
[11:20:44] <Jattenalle> disappearedng, $(tr).find('button').click() ?
[11:20:54] <duch_kazatel> use event delegation.
[11:20:56] <Jattenalle> it'll be really slow though
[11:21:13] <disappearedng> eh I can do that. But then that requires me to call $(tr).find('button') everytime the table refreshes
[11:21:23] <Jattenalle> do what duch_kazatel said
[11:21:26] <duch_kazatel> use event delegation instead.
[11:21:28] <disappearedng> why the f will someone write a plugin in 2014 and not use jquery?
[11:21:31] <Jattenalle> also it sounds like you're doing something the wrong way around :P
[11:21:35] <BillCriswell> disappearedng: Do $('table').on('click', 'button', function () { });
[11:21:44] <disappearedng> ok
[11:21:47] <BillCriswell> Assuming the table is statis and not reloaded all the time.
[11:21:53] <disappearedng> yeah table is constnat
[11:21:54] <BillCriswell> s/statis/static
[11:21:56] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[11:24:24] <BillCriswell> disappearedng: http://jsbin.com/fufigevo/1/edit?html,js,output real simple demo of it.
[11:27:07] <disappearedng> hey if I have an jquery object, how can I say "I want to search for <td>" inside this parent (within this branch)?
[11:27:23] <BillCriswell> .find
[11:27:42] <BillCriswell> $('tr').find('td') etc
[11:28:11] <disappearedng> ok thanks that's what I need
[11:29:02] <duch_kazatel> OR  $('tr td')
[11:29:11] <duch_kazatel> or  $('td', 'tr')
[11:32:56] <duch_kazatel> all right i'm off to beer it up for lunch
[11:33:44] <BillCriswell> Enjoy.
[11:38:55] <Earthnail> hi everyone. I'm having issues doing a CORS request with jQuery. The resource that I'm accessing has the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header set. I can verify it by manually accessing the URL using the Postman Chrome extension. Using jQuery, I get
[11:38:56] <Earthnail> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://192.168.33.10:8888/login/. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost' is therefore not allowed access.
[11:39:42] <Fishbowne2> Earthnail, you are using chrome to call your nodejs via AJAX ?
[11:39:49] <Earthnail> no nodeJS ;)
[11:39:52] <Fishbowne2> oh.
[11:40:33] <Fishbowne2> you will have to use JSONP or alter the server to allows requests from your server.
[11:40:41] <Fishbowne2> alter the webserver.
[11:40:42] <Earthnail> I altered the server
[11:40:48] <Fishbowne2> nginx ?
[11:40:49] <Earthnail> it sends the Access-Control-Allow-Origin
[11:40:55] <Earthnail> Python/Tornado
[11:40:58] <Fishbowne2> hmm
[11:41:07] <Earthnail> Again, I can verify that by accessing the resource using Postman in Chrome
[11:41:20] <Fishbowne2> you mean via the debug window ?
[11:41:29] <Earthnail> https://www.dropbox.com/s/mxmsaybdtt9822q/Screenshot%202014-04-09%2020.41.14.png
[11:41:44] <Earthnail> Postman: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en
[11:41:59] <Earthnail> so the server is configured correctly
[11:42:04] <Earthnail> my JS code is:
[11:42:04] <Fishbowne2> probably won't accept localhost since its not a qualified domain
[11:42:23] <Fishbowne2> localhost technically could be anywhere.
[11:42:30] <Earthnail> true
[11:42:37] <Fishbowne2> well... anywhere on THis side of the gateway
[11:42:45] <Earthnail> my JS code: http://pastebin.com/QgZqTNTr
[11:42:52] <fskirschbaum> *Earthnail* Try specifying local ip?
[11:42:59] <Fishbowne2> you probably need to specifically put in the domain of the host
[11:43:04] <Earthnail> fskirschbaum: I can do that
[11:43:13] <shoky> Earthnail: does your server also reply to the OPTIONS request
[11:43:26] <Earthnail> my problem is that in the fail function, I can't even see the headers
[11:43:35] <Earthnail> I can't see the reply in the jQuery fail function
[11:43:54] <Earthnail> shoky: I don't know, honestly. I'd have to check it. I'd like to get the request in the fail function first, though
[11:44:03] <guideX> $("#m").bind("click", ".cmdDelete", function (e) {   ... when I use $(this) I'm getting #m not .cmdDelete ... how do I get cmddelete?
[11:44:50] <shoky> Earthnail: when you POST cross-domain, the browser will first send a CORS preflight request (which is an OPTIONS http request) which the server needs to respond to properly
[11:44:59] <Earthnail> shoky: thanks
[11:45:03] <Earthnail> I'll look into it
[11:46:27] <shoky> actually the preflight only happens if the content-type is changed, so maybe that's not it
[11:51:52] <guideX> $("#m").bind("click", ".cmdDelete", function (e) {   ... when I use $(this) I'm getting #m not .cmdDelete ... how do I get cmddelete?
[11:51:54] <guideX> :))
[11:52:11] <BillCriswell> guideX: Use .on
[11:52:38] <guideX> for some reason, with .on, I get "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'on' " but i'm using 1.10.2
[11:52:42] <guideX> on this project
[11:52:53] <BillCriswell> Really? That's weird.
[11:53:02] <guideX> I thought I was just going crazy...
[11:53:13] <guideX> this is the jquery I'm using http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js
[11:53:15] <BillCriswell> I would need to see the code.
[11:53:38] <guideX> just using that and this.. $("#m").bind("click", ".cmdDelete", function (e) {
[11:53:48] <guideX> except not .bind, .on
[11:55:59] <guideX> oh wait.. I think an older jquery is loaded too
[11:56:24] <guideX> ah ok.. I didn't notice in the masterpage a v1.5 is loaded
[11:56:33] <guideX> hmm any way to do that with 1.5?
[11:59:12] <Jon47> .delegate perhaps?
[11:59:19] <Jon47> forget what verison .on was added, maybe 1.6 or 1.7
[12:02:24] <BillCriswell> Yeah, you would need to use delegate.
[12:02:56] <guideX> hmm ok
[12:03:04] <BillCriswell> $('#m').delegate('click', '.cmdDelete', something);
[12:03:28] <BillCriswell> Blah, swithc click with .cmdDelete
[12:06:58] <guideX> ahh cool yes, delegate works ... thanks ! $("#m").delegate(".cmdDelete","click", function(e) {
[12:07:12] <guideX> i'll upgrade the jquery library later to avoid unknowns for now, thanks again
[12:07:32] <Fishbowne2> well touchpunch locks my code up
[12:07:58] <BillCriswell> guideX: If you plan on updating why not do it sooner?
[12:11:07] <guideX> BillCriswell: it would take too long to fix/replace the other libraries during this update, I'm on too much of a time crunch
[12:11:21] <guideX> if I change the lib for one page, I ghave to change them for all pages
[12:11:27] <guideX> and then everything will break heh
[12:12:23] <guideX> for instance, jquery popups and stuff might break...
[12:12:28] <guideX> usually does with a big jquery update
[12:13:21] <Bloomberg> hi
[12:13:40] <Bloomberg> how can I to set a progress bar while load complete function with $.post();
[12:13:47] <BillCriswell> guideX: Ah, got it.
[12:15:08] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: You could fake it, load it a little by little till it completes then have it zoom to 100%.
[12:15:14] <BillCriswell> fake it pretty easily*
[12:17:52] <tandroid> Do people fake the progress bars a lot?
[12:17:58] <NicholasC> tandroid, yup.
[12:18:03] <tandroid> I figured
[12:18:15] <tandroid> Sometimes it's really obvious but not always
[12:18:26] <NicholasC> Getting an actual progress bar to work properly can be really hard depending on what you're doing with it
[12:18:46] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell : how i geti t?
[12:18:46] <BillCriswell> Yeah, when it hangs at 99% I assume it's faked.
[12:19:04] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: http://nanobar.micronube.com/ seems pretty simple
[12:19:15] <tandroid> or goes from 20 to 100 instantly
[12:19:36] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: http://ricostacruz.com/nprogress/ is another.
[12:19:57] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: This one has an .inc() so you can just call that till it's complete then set it to 100.
[12:20:07] <_lazarevsky_> hello all
[12:20:17] <_lazarevsky_> the setter of data() doesnt seem to work
[12:20:21] <_lazarevsky_> is that like a known bug
[12:20:33] <BillCriswell> _lazarevsky_: Shouldn't assume it's a bug off that bat.
[12:20:43] <_lazarevsky_> ok
[12:20:55] <_lazarevsky_> let me reproduce it in a fiddle
[12:20:57] <BillCriswell> If setting data didn't work we'd know very quickly haha.
[12:21:00] <BillCriswell> _lazarevsky_: Awesome.
[12:21:48] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: I mean you can call that every x milliseconds *
[12:23:05] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell : I would like to do something more simple like in ajax beforeSend: function(){ 				loading... 				},
[12:23:30] <Bloomberg> but with $.post() i don't know how can I controle the status
[12:23:42] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: You should be able to do it through ajaxSetup
[12:23:47] <BillCriswell> I think that's the name of it?
[12:23:57] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajaxsetup/ yesh
[12:24:13] <_lazarevsky_> BillCriswell: lol in jsfiddle it works..
[12:24:17] <_lazarevsky_> what the hell
[12:24:21] <BillCriswell> _lazarevsky_: Figured that would happen.
[12:24:28] <_lazarevsky_> hows that even possible?!
[12:24:32] <_lazarevsky_> the getter works fine in my app
[12:24:34] <_lazarevsky_> the setter is off
[12:24:41] <BillCriswell> _lazarevsky_: So many ways.
[12:25:06] <BillCriswell> _lazarevsky_: I have no idea without the code in front of me.
[12:26:18] <_lazarevsky_> oh my god
[12:26:25] <_lazarevsky_> how on earth is this possible?1
[12:26:27] <_lazarevsky_> fuck
[12:26:33] <_lazarevsky_> sorry about my outburst
[12:27:50] <BillCriswell> _lazarevsky_: It's gotta be something.
[12:27:58] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: http://jsbin.com/zupapeqa/1/edit
[12:28:04] <BillCriswell> It happens very quickly, but it works.
[12:28:40] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell : tahnk you so much man
[12:29:04] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[12:29:29] <_lazarevsky_> BillCriswell: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ff42aac6491a69d02594
[12:29:40] <_lazarevsky_> here u go..
[12:31:43] <_lazarevsky_> oh I can always use attr()
[12:31:47] <_cjm> Hi Folks, Suppose I have no class, 'xxx'.  Then $x = $('.xxx'); will match nothing, so length == zero is the best way to test for no matches?
[12:32:00] <_lazarevsky_> I've been stuck on this for 20 minutes already.. not worth it
[12:32:26] <BillCriswell> _lazarevsky_: I have no idea what I'm looking at here haha.
[12:32:45] <fskirschbaum> *_cjm* https://gist.github.com/fskirschbaum/10277870
[12:33:25] <BillCriswell> _cjm: Yes, what fskirschbaum posted basically does is just that.
[12:34:10] <fskirschbaum> *_cjm* There's some argument as to whether or not that's the most efficent way of testing that, but I've found it's worked pretty well for me.
[12:34:15] <_cjm> fskirschbaum, BillCriswell Thanks folks.  I appreciate.
[12:34:32] <damasceno_> Hello. I have this code which creates the jQuery Modal: http://pastebin.com/g5fN8ntu It works fine but I need to close it when the user clicks on Search (When the user clicks on Close it closes, no problem). Does anyone know how to do it? Thanks.
[12:34:36] <fskirschbaum> *_cjm* No problem.
[12:35:08] <BillCriswell> No focus todayyyy
[12:37:04] <fskirschbaum> *damasceno_* .modal('hide')?
[12:37:27] <fskirschbaum> Is that from another library?
[12:38:17] <fskirschbaum> Bootstrap, for example?
[12:38:57] <Danny> Am i in?
[12:39:11] <fskirschbaum> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals <- $('#myModal').modal('hide') would be how to hide that damasceno_
[12:40:04] <damasceno_> fskirschbaum: thanks I'm going to take a look.
[12:40:19] <Danny> Hey guys, anyone has a solution to calculate an image' height after its autoscaled by the width of an imagetag?
[12:42:45] <_lazarevsky_> BillCriswell: Officially I am a clinical idiot
[12:42:55] <_lazarevsky_> BillCriswell: there I said it so the whole world can see
[12:43:17] <_lazarevsky_> BillCriswell: different naming of the element's id was the problem
[12:43:20] <_lazarevsky_> thanks for yer help!
[12:44:10] <BillCriswell> _lazarevsky_: No problem. Figured it was something silly.
[12:44:33] <BillCriswell> Danny: You want the original height or the scaled height?
[12:45:43] <BillCriswell> Danny: just using $('img').height() would return that.
[12:46:19] <Danny> @BillCriswell this will return the original height.
[12:46:31] <Danny> But i need the scaled height
[12:47:25] <BillCriswell> Danny: http://jsbin.com/virineri/1/edit is returning the scaled height.
[12:48:13] <duch_lunch> wooo.
[12:48:23] <BillCriswell> Hm... calling .height() on an image seems change the height property on the image?
[12:48:48] <duch_kazatel> orly?
[12:49:04] <BillCriswell> Yeah, so weird: http://jsbin.com/virineri/2/edit?html,js,output
[12:51:15] <Danny> BillCriswell: So whats the solution right now? Is it the scaled height or the originalHeight?
[12:51:31] <BillCriswell> Danny: .height() returns the scaled height.
[12:52:06] <duch_kazatel> woah it does.
[12:52:08] <duch_kazatel> i wonder why.
[12:52:47] <Danny> BillCriswell: mhmm... maybe you can take a look why it doesnt on my project?
[12:53:17] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: KNow where I'd find that in the source?
[12:53:25] <duch_kazatel> let me look.
[12:53:29] <BillCriswell> Should know how to navigate this by now.
[12:54:10] <Danny> BillCriswell: i only get the originalsize .. http://goo.gl/VHtZ0v i need the scaled height from the topimage, console logs are only 700 (the originalHeight)
[12:54:38] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: In firefox it's different. Interesting.
[12:54:55] <BillCriswell> I guess chrome doesn't update the height?
[12:54:58] <BillCriswell> Sure it's something weird.
[12:56:05] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/dimensions.js
[12:56:11] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: http://jsbin.com/virineri/3/edit Haha, there we go.
[12:57:50] <Danny> BillCriswell: Mhmmm why its working fine at yours and doesnt at mines?
[13:01:00] <BillCriswell> Danny: Do you have a height set in your css?
[13:01:33] <Danny> BillCriswell: On the image i want to calculate itself?
[13:01:50] <Danny> -no
[13:02:36] <BillCriswell> Danny: This is updating just as I'd imagine: http://jsbin.com/virineri/4/edit?css,js,output
[13:02:48] <Mushr00m> Hello ! I have a strange issue with JQuery 1.10 and fadein / fadeout on FF on mac. The divs are shifting 1px during the effect and come back right…. I saw somebody saying to use box-shadow: #000 0em 0em 0em; and it's working but it's soooo strange do you know why ? And a better solution ?
[13:03:04] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Mushr00m
[13:03:05] <b-ot> Mushr00m: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:03:23] <Mushr00m> b-ot : you can see it here : http://www.coach-inn-sport.fr/
[13:03:29] <Mushr00m> the big banner on top
[13:03:31] <duch_kazatel> Mushr00m b-ot is a bot ;)
[13:03:37] <Mushr00m> lol
[13:03:39] <Mushr00m> thanks
[13:03:48] <duch_kazatel> which scripts?
[13:04:24] <Mushr00m> it's directly into the code you can see it with firebug
[13:04:36] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[13:04:40] <Mushr00m> before the div with ID wl_banners
[13:05:14] <Mushr00m> yes I know but it's just for dev after I separate it. It's the same here if it's a separate file
[13:05:41] <duch_kazatel> either way, i'll bet it has something to do with the way fadein and out run their animations, but without seeing a use case it's hard to know.
[13:06:11] <Mushr00m> duch_kazatel : OK i create a jsfiddle
[13:06:18] <Mushr00m> give me a second be right back
[13:07:07] <Danny> BillCriswell: Hey thats working fine, and now i need it on window.load but thats not working any solutions?
[13:10:16] <BillCriswell> What isn't working?

[13:17:08] <krizoek> function addtobiblelist(bid,bn){ $('#select-choice-9').append('<option value="'+bid+'">'+bn+'</option>');}  doesn't seem to work to append values inside a function. but it works outside the function. any ideas?
[13:17:24] <BillCriswell> Danny: I don't know.  Don't have the time to look it over thoroughly.
[13:18:35] <duch_kazatel> krizoek can you fiddle it?
[13:20:59] <ankurk_> Let's just say I don't want to write that much html while appending a tag, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9412576fe6fc5ffc0ec1. What would be the most efficient to create a tag and append it?
[13:21:12] <ankurk_> *wya
[13:21:14] <ankurk_> *way
[13:22:09] <duch_kazatel> a few ways

[13:22:43] <duch_kazatel> wish i could turn that off in mirc.
[13:22:47] <ankurk_> lol
[13:23:01] <ankurk_> that's funny
[13:23:26] <duch_kazatel> the autocopy is terrible.
[13:23:32] <Cork> duch_kazatel: you can
[13:23:44] <duch_kazatel> ! where?
[13:23:47] <Cork> duch_kazatel: you meant i spammed you a bit ^^?
[13:24:07] <duch_kazatel> the obnoxious auto copy/paste in mirc.
[13:24:09] <Cork> in the options > message tab if i remember correctly
[13:24:23] <ankurk_> anyhow, can you complete the code? :p
[13:24:25] <duch_kazatel> oh, no those are fine.
[13:24:28] <duch_kazatel> yeah, one sec.

[13:27:56] <duch_kazatel> if you pass a string to that function, it works fine.
[13:27:58] <Cork> duch_kazatel: had to update by bouncer cause of the lovely openssl problem
[13:28:06] <ankurk_> duch_kazatel, I did this http://jsfiddle.net/QeT9L/ but it didn't work
[13:28:14] <duch_kazatel> Cork nah that wasn't my compain.
[13:28:18] <duch_kazatel> *complaint
[13:28:27] <krizoek> great, thank you duch_kazatel :)
[13:29:11] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ what is toString?
[13:29:19] <duch_kazatel> you mean .toString()?
[13:29:30] <duch_kazatel> also, you don't have any text defined there.
[13:29:32] <ankurk_> yep
[13:30:03] <duch_kazatel> you need to define text for it to show up.
[13:30:12] <ankurk_> f***
[13:30:29] <duch_kazatel> :)
[13:30:31] <ankurk_> I forgot text, hmm
[13:31:15] <ankurk_> I learned something new :D yay!
[13:31:28] <ankurk_> thanks a lot duch_kazatel :D
[13:31:44] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[13:38:07] <connekt> hello i have a modal window with some videos using html5 code and when i close the modal the video keeps on playing?
[13:38:49] <duch_kazatel> connekt closing doesn't remove anything ;)
[13:38:51] <connekt> my problem is i have very limited knowledge as of now of jquery and although i have found some material thru google i just dont know how to inject the code into my js file to fix the issue
[13:39:17] <connekt> haha duch_kazatel so i have realized
[13:39:59] <connekt> should i paste the link to my webpage? or make a pastie of my js file?
[13:40:32] <ankurk_> On a side note, I loved this ppt, http://www.slideshare.net/SlexAxton/how-to-manage-large-jquery-apps
[13:40:54] <duch_kazatel> connekt a working jsfiddle is preferred.
[13:40:56] <duch_kazatel> a small use case.
[13:41:15] <duch_kazatel> connekt but again, it's probably that you need to bind to the close event and have that stop / remove the video.
[13:42:50] <Nasp> http://jsfiddle.net/DKBU9/42/ would anyone know why the animation is off by a few 100 pixels?
[13:43:07] <Nasp> Try and drag an element from one area to another
[13:44:07] <connekt> tameernyc.com/residential duch_kazatel since there are multiple js files attached to it. The button is the "watch ductless technology" white button underneath main image
[13:44:56] <connekt> www.tameernyc.com/residential duch_kazatel
[13:45:07] <duch_kazatel> connekt aaaaand for the third time - closing the modal won't do anything about pausing/stopping/removing the video.
[13:45:09] <Voyage_> hi
[13:45:24] <duch_kazatel> you'll need to attach to the close event of the modal and fire off a handler that does that part for you.
[13:45:30] <Voyage_> shouldn't the .className show me the classes names that are applied to an element?
[13:45:37] <Fatalnix> oh, duch_kazatel I solved the issue
[13:45:47] <Fatalnix> upgraded chrome from 24 to 34
[13:45:55] <Fatalnix> >:O
[13:45:57] <duch_kazatel> Voyage_ i've never heard of .className
[13:46:10] <duch_kazatel> Voyage_ i think you want .attr('class');
[13:46:26] <connekt> duch_kazatel i totallyunderstand what u mean but the issue is i dont know how to jquery
[13:46:26] <duch_kazatel> Fatalnix hm?
[13:46:32] <SuperPhl_> Hey folks, I have a .click() event on a div... it works fine, but if you double click or just quick really quickly it selects all the text on the page. Is there a way to prevent that?
[13:46:33] <connekt> i found this $('.video-container iframe').attr('src', '');
[13:46:36] <connekt> to kill the src
[13:46:44] <duch_kazatel> connekt that won't do anything for you.
[13:46:54] <connekt> but i dont klnow how to assimilate the code
[13:47:01] <Voyage_> duch_kazatel,  if the element had more than 1 class?
[13:47:02] <duch_kazatel> connekt then hire somebody who can?
[13:47:28] <duch_kazatel> Voyage_ .attr('class') will give you the value of the class attribute.
[13:47:31] <connekt> duch_kazatel u think a smallissue that can be fixed in 5 mins someone would charge me for that?
[13:47:40] <Voyage_> duch_kazatel,  hm so I think this is javascript and not jquery var classList = document.getElementById('divId').className.split(/\s+/);
[13:47:43] <duch_kazatel> connekt probably.
[13:47:46] <Fatalnix> duch_kazatel: been a few hours. I was asking about how I thought the images and such were screwing with the size of my div's etc?
[13:47:52] <Fatalnix> and it turns out it was a chrome bug
[13:48:07] <duch_kazatel> Voyage_ ah, yes there's a classname property in javascript, yes,.
[13:48:21] <connekt> duch_kazatel can u instead please help me walk me through it so i can learn for myself too plz?
[13:48:24] <duch_kazatel> connekt otherwise you need to learn some basics.
[13:48:30] <Voyage_> duch_kazatel,  if the <div class="myclass myOtherClass"> then what wil $(div).atter("class") give?
[13:48:46] <connekt> i have bought some course on jquery but wont be able to study it for a few months
[13:48:46] <duch_kazatel> .attr() - and that'd give you "myclass myOtherClass"
[13:48:47] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: gi - ☹☺ MAYBE!
[13:48:58] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery on
[13:49:00] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .on() | jQuery API Documentation → https://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:49:05] <duch_kazatel> ^ connekt start there.
[13:49:07] <rainabba> When some idiot has used preventDefault() with bind() to prevent "pasting" to an input form, how do I remove that behavior (on a live page with the element ID)?
[13:49:18] <duch_kazatel> rainabba .off();
[13:49:28] <rainabba> duch_kazatel: ty
[13:49:36] <duch_kazatel> that'll remove the entire handler btw.
[13:50:01] <connekt> ...
[13:50:03] <duch_kazatel> .off('event')
[13:50:09] <rainabba> .off('paste') will remove JUST that one preventing paste?
[13:50:14] <rainabba> :)
[13:50:19] <duch_kazatel> rainabba whatever the eventname is, yeah.
[13:50:30] <connekt> i was gonna begin learnignjavascrtipt before jquery
[13:50:43] <connekt> becuase that would make sense no?
[13:50:45] <duch_kazatel> connekt nobody here will do it for you unless they're feeling charitable and have the time.  i've given you the instructions.
[13:51:07] <duch_kazatel> which modaling library are you using, connekt?
[13:51:17] <rainabba> connekt: jQuery IS javascript so you can't use it without knowing JS.
[13:51:30] <Rodael> SuperPhl_: You can make all the text un-selectable with css, if that's what you want. (user-select: none). Doesn't really work in IE<10 though.
[13:51:45] <connekt> i basically used this duch_kazatel http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/06/25/nifty-modal-window-effects/
[13:51:46] <rainabba> connekt: Not in a bigger context anyway. You can of course fumble around.
[13:51:52] <SuperPhl_> Rodael: what about just the action when done on the div?
[13:52:37] <duch_kazatel> connekt cool, so read the docs about .on() as a start.
[13:53:02] <duch_kazatel> connekt bind a listener to the close button that removes/stops/pauses/whatever the video.
[13:53:09] <Rodael> SuperPhl_: You want the text to be selectable while the action is not being executed? ;o
[13:53:12] <duch_kazatel> connekt protip: you've all ready got a close button, right?
[13:53:26] <connekt> duch_kazatel yes i do
[13:53:38] <SuperPhl_> Rodael: http://thegoodiebag.co <-- hit the "right" button quickly
[13:53:41] <connekt> close.addEventListener( 'click', function( ev ) { 				ev.stopPropagation(); 				removeModalHandler(); 			});
[13:53:59] <duch_kazatel> connekt cool, so add in logic to stop/pause/remove the video in there.
[13:54:30] <connekt> i realsied that i tried injecting code in there i found on google to no avail lol
[13:54:55] <connekt> soi should add within this line i just copypasted or start a new line
[13:54:59] <duch_kazatel> connekt then learn what do actually do.
[13:55:03] <duch_kazatel> *what to
[13:55:11] <duch_kazatel> it would be inside of your close handler.
[13:55:26] <pragma-> let's inject random code found in a google search and hope for the best.  sounds like a winning strategy.
[13:55:27] <SuperPhl_> Rodael: nevermind, i got it... added a $(this).blur();
[13:55:27] <connekt> so the code i just pasted is the close handler?
[13:55:41] <duch_kazatel> connekt dunno - probably?
[13:55:51] <Rodael> SuperPhl_: Not seeing the issue here (Chrome&IE11). IE9 however shows it :)
[13:55:56] <connekt> pragma- ()()----> --
[13:56:10] <pragma-> is that supposed to be a penis?
[13:56:14] <duch_kazatel> really?
[13:56:40] <connekt> ok im gonna lookup a close handler
[13:56:49] <pragma-> I guess I should be fortunate that you really suck at ascii art.
[13:57:14] <duch_kazatel> i'm glad i can choose to ignore him now.
[13:58:26] <connekt> duch_kazatel u were doing good
[13:58:45] <duch_kazatel> connekt and then you drew an ascii dick to somebody else.
[13:59:10] <connekt> thats between me and him he pokjed fun at me i poiked back
[13:59:15] <duch_kazatel> while not actually taking my advice.
[13:59:24] <connekt> no im looking up clsoe handler
[13:59:30] <duch_kazatel> you want event handler
[13:59:47] <duch_kazatel> you pasted an event handler.  dunno if its the one you want.
[14:00:27] <DansVC> hi :D
[14:01:13] <connekt> the thing is i dont have any dollar signs ($) in mycode
[14:01:21] <connekt> i think it has something to dowith classie.js
[14:01:29] <duch_kazatel> connekt are you using jquery or javascript
[14:01:40] <connekt> jquery
[14:01:40] <duch_kazatel> because what you supplied was plain ol' javascript
[14:03:19] <SuperPhl_> array.push(array.shift()); <-- that takes the first and moves it to the last. How do I reverse that and move from the last and put it at the start?
[14:04:01] <duch_kazatel> array.pop(array.unshift()); probably
[14:05:00] <Nasp> http://jsfiddle.net/DKBU9/42/ When i drag and an element the animation is off by a few pixels, i can't seem to figure out why
[14:05:29] <connekt> http://pastie.org/9063555
[14:05:52] <connekt> duch_kazatel http://pastie.org/9063555
[14:06:11] <duch_kazatel> connekt no thanks.
[14:06:24] <duch_kazatel> please go learn event binding instead.
[14:06:45] <duch_kazatel> also: don't edit that code.
[14:06:54] <dunbuggy> im getting some weird interference from two $.ajax requests
[14:07:03] <connekt> why shouldnt i edit that coe?
[14:07:09] <connekt> code*
[14:07:11] <dunbuggy> one seems to be calling the success function of another
[14:07:13] <duch_kazatel> connekt because you're not supposed to edit plugins.
[14:07:39] <dunbuggy> anyone ever encountered that?
[14:07:40] <duch_kazatel> connekt instead, add an event listener in your own code.
[14:07:43] <connekt> so how do u suppose i fix this issue withoutediting thatfile?
[14:07:44] <jamieshepherd> So.. pretty simple one I'm sure.. I have an input button.. I need to send that button to /search/{variable} where variable is whatever text is entered in a text box.. Any ideas?
[14:08:25] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ dunbuggy
[14:08:25] <b-ot> dunbuggy: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:08:32] <duch_kazatel> jamieshepherd what do you have so far?
[14:09:33] <jamieshepherd> just scraps of other people's code from google ;o I have an autocomplete with jquery UI, when they click a result it goes there fine. But if they just type + press enter or click submit I need it to go to "search"
[14:09:59] <connekt> ok duch_kazatel  found tis <button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').pause()">Pause the Audio</button>
[14:10:13] <duch_kazatel> connekt nope.
[14:10:25] <duch_kazatel> onclick= is bad.
[14:12:57] <connekt> $("#closeSimple").click(function() {     $("div#simpleModal").removeClass("show");     $("#videoContainer").pause();     return false;                    });  <video id="videoContainer" width="320" height="240" src="Davis_5109iPadFig3.m4v" controls="controls"> </video>
[14:13:09] <duch_kazatel> do not paste in the channel please.
[14:13:12] <connekt> ok
[14:13:22] <duch_kazatel> use something like jsfiddle instead.
[14:13:42] <connekt> would anyhting on here work http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5958132/javascript-to-stop-html5-video-playback-on-modal-window-close
[14:13:59] <connekt> im lookinjg at answer number 5
[14:14:01] <duch_kazatel> dude stop coding by google.
[14:14:21] <duch_kazatel> "number 5"?
[14:14:32] <duch_kazatel> you mean http://stackoverflow.com/a/5958203/923919
[14:15:12] <connekt> yea
[14:15:18] <Nasp> Ahh this is driving me nuts
[14:15:32] <duch_kazatel> Nasp i'll bet it's a positioning issue or something.
[14:15:48] <connekt> or this http://stackoverflow.com/a/22156790
[14:15:51] <Nasp> Hmm
[14:15:56] <duch_kazatel> connekt again, stop coding by google.
[14:16:20] <Nasp> duch_kazatel well if i could just get the current position of dragged element relative to the drop area
[14:16:23] <Nasp> Everything would be fine
[14:16:29] <Nasp> But it just seems to be off, no matter what
[14:22:09] <dunbuggy> ok heres the code http://jsfiddle.net/seanjdunn85/mfvp5/
[14:23:13] <dunbuggy> wait, hold on
[14:23:20] <dunbuggy> i need to add something
[14:23:27] <duch_kazatel> oh dude. no.
[14:23:29] <duch_kazatel> noooo.
[14:23:41] <duch_kazatel> this is terrible all around.
[14:24:05] <duch_kazatel> you're combining intervals with ajax, and success with done
[14:25:15] <Nasp> duch, did you have any idea what the issue could be except a bug in jquery?
[14:25:25] <duch_kazatel> Nasp link again please?
[14:25:49] <t_user> setInterval(..., 6000) = once every 6 second.. heh
[14:26:05] <Nasp> duch_kazatel http://jsfiddle.net/DKBU9/42/
[14:26:17] <duch_kazatel> t_user combining that with ajax and not adding in anything that stops timers while the ajax is running is a bad idea.
[14:26:54] <t_user> i also like that the if-statement does the same either way
[14:26:57] <Nasp> When you drop the element over an area its position gets shifted by a 100 pixels or so, and then the animation starts
[14:27:21] <duch_kazatel> Nasp but if you drag it outside of the box far enough it works fine ;)
[14:27:36] <Nasp> Hehe
[14:27:39] <Nasp> I did notice that :)
[14:27:49] <Nasp> the revert works fine
[14:27:59] <Nasp> Although it didn't when i used a sortable
[14:28:17] <Nasp> So i switched to two drag and drop elements
[14:28:43] <dunbuggy> duch_kazatel: yeah i know
[14:28:53] <dunbuggy> http://jsfiddle.net/seanjdunn85/c8q6F/
[14:29:08] <duch_kazatel> Nasp what do you think ui.draggable.detach().appendTo($(this)) is doing?
[14:29:23] <dunbuggy> i didnt want to wait a full minute while figuring this out
[14:29:35] <t_user> oh, didnt think about that
[14:30:30] <Nasp> duch_kazatel it should append it to the ul
[14:30:30] <dunbuggy> uh anyway this ajax requet getFriendsStatus is monkeying with an element referenced in another ajax request. when i commented it out in the setInterval, everything wen ok
[14:30:33] <dunbuggy> *went
[14:31:21] <duch_kazatel> i wonder if the detach() has something to do with it.
[14:31:35] <duch_kazatel> nope nvm.
[14:31:42] <Nasp> detach doesnt change anything
[14:32:14] <dunbuggy> there's a lot of dumbness in there but it's still a weird problem
[14:32:48] <Nasp> I feel like the solution should be simple
[14:33:05] <dunbuggy> lol wait
[14:33:32] <dunbuggy> wtf
[14:33:51] <dunbuggy> god damn im insane
[14:33:55] <dunbuggy> nevermind
[14:35:21] <connekt> problem solved
[14:35:25] <connekt> thanks duch_katazel
[14:36:28] <dunbuggy> thank god you can delete fiddles
[14:36:34] <duch_kazatel> lol
[14:38:30] <Voyage_> how to make this input radio as "checked/selected"? input[name="box-editing-form-type"]
[14:40:33] <Voyage_> I mean how to make a radio box as selected if I know its value?
[14:43:21] <duch_kazatel> .prop('selected', 'selected') iirc.
[14:44:27] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/84CY8/
[14:44:41] <phelix> Could someone help me figure out how to target just the div that is inside
[14:45:07] <phelix> they all have the same class but if I mouse over the main row I want it to add class to the element inside
[14:45:10] <phelix> that make sense?
[14:45:50] <Voyage_> duch_kazatel,  ya but how to identify the radio by value
[14:46:35] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:47:04] <Voyage_> <input name="box-editing-form-type" value="vertical" type="radio" checked="checked" />Vertical Box
[14:47:09] <duch_kazatel> phelix you mean only to the thing you're over?
[14:47:12] <Voyage_> <input name="box-editing-form-type" value="horizontal" type="radio" />Horizontal Box
[14:47:26] <duch_kazatel> Voyage_ by using an attribute selector, like you've all ready got.
[14:47:39] <phelix> duch_kazatel Well kind of. If I am over .pdf-grand-row-item I want to add a class to its child element .pdf-grand-answer
[14:47:43] <duch_kazatel> or give it a class/ID in your backend and use taht instead.
[14:47:47] <phelix> but not to all items thta have .pdf-grand-answer
[14:47:54] <phelix> just the one inside the one that I hover on
[14:48:05] <Voyage_> If I know that the value is "vertical" , how can I make the vertical radio checked?
[14:48:10] <Voyage_> duch_kazatel,  ^
[14:48:13] <duch_kazatel> phelix $(this).find('.pdf-grand-answer')
[14:48:20] <phelix> ahh ok thank you
[14:48:37] <duch_kazatel> Voyage_ attribute selectos are very slow, but you literally just used an attribute selector.
[14:48:50] <Voyage_> ya, but how?
[14:48:56] <duch_kazatel> input[name="box-editing-form-type"] is an example.
[14:49:30] <Voyage_> hm bu how to make input[name="box-editing-form-type"]   as selected on which the radio has a value of "vertical"?
[14:49:38] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:50:05] <duch_kazatel> you'll probably have to loop through them all and set the .prop() i showed you earlier.
[14:50:24] <Voyage_> hm
[14:50:45] <Voyage_> or I can make <input id='vertical' too?
[14:50:56] <Voyage_> and use id instead
[14:51:03] <duch_kazatel> it would be smarter to use an ID or a class, yes.
[14:51:14] <duch_kazatel> attribute selectors are very slow.
[14:51:32] <Voyage_> $('input[value="2"]').attr('checked',true);       /=?
[14:51:40] <duch_kazatel> ....
[14:51:46] <duch_kazatel> wha kind of input is it?
[14:51:48] <Earthnail> hi guys
[14:51:49] <duch_kazatel> *what
[14:52:02] <Voyage_> $('#idOfMyRadio').attr('checked',true);
[14:52:13] <duch_kazatel> Voyage_ so it's a radio button?
[14:52:18] <Voyage_> yes
[14:52:28] <Earthnail> I asked a question before about CORS requests. This is the code I use for requests: http://pastebin.com/QgZqTNTr  (note that the url(path) function in line 6 converts the /login/ path to a full URL)
[14:52:51] <duch_kazatel> Voyage_ then yes, use that.
[14:52:53] <Voyage_> duch_kazatel,  so what is bettera?
[14:53:08] <Voyage_> $('input[value="2"]').attr('checked',true);    or   $('#idOfMyRadio').attr('checked',true);
[14:53:12] <Zzaichik> number 2!
[14:53:16] <duch_kazatel> $('#idOfMyRadio').attr('checked',true);
[14:53:17] <Voyage_> k
[14:53:21] <duch_kazatel> don't use attribute selectors ever.
[14:53:23] <Voyage_> thanks
[14:53:25] <Voyage_> hm
[14:53:26] <Voyage_> ok
[14:53:26] <duch_kazatel> if you can manage it.
[14:53:30] <Zzaichik> ^^
[14:53:32] <Earthnail> The answer I got was that I should check if my server supports the OPTIONS request, and returns an appropriate. Turns out it didn't. I added this functionality now, but I still get an error:
[14:53:39] <Earthnail> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://192.168.33.10:8888/login/. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost' is therefore not allowed access.
[14:53:53] <duch_kazatel> Earthnail do you have CORS enabled on your server?
[14:54:13] <Earthnail> duch_kazatel: yes, I set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to "http://localhost" (which seems to be the value that Chrome expects)
[14:54:39] <duch_kazatel> Earthnail read the error again
[14:54:51] <duch_kazatel> http://192.168.33.10:8888/login/ !== 'http://localhost
[14:55:01] <duch_kazatel> http://192.168.33.10:8888/login/ <- this is the server that needs CORS enabled btw
[14:55:07] <Earthnail> duch_kazatel: yes
[14:55:23] <Earthnail> here is the response of a manual OPTIONS request on 192.168.33.10:8888/login/
[14:55:37] <Earthnail> https://www.dropbox.com/s/jilds0cgtuygbvb/Screenshot%202014-04-09%2023.55.30.png
[14:55:44] <duch_kazatel> what server are you using?
[14:55:51] <Earthnail> Python/Tornado
[14:56:16] <Earthnail> the thing is: if I manually make requests, I can see the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header
[14:56:17] <duch_kazatel> try setting that value to * and see what happens.
[14:56:21] <Earthnail> duch_kazatel: ok
[14:56:55] <Earthnail> duch_kazatel: same error
[14:57:40] <jwmann> How would I take this concept except upon selecting the button, it iterates through the array of objects and only selects the next, prev, and current if it contains options : bar - http://jsfiddle.net/x2X3Q/2/
[14:57:44] <krizoek> how can i stop a <a href button from performing a submit to the form. and just trigger a on click event?
[14:57:54] <krizoek> it seems jquery wants to load a index.html that doesnt exist
[14:58:12] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery preventdefault @ krizoek
[14:58:13] <b-ot> krizoek: Sorry, no results for ‟jquery preventdefault @ krizoek”.
[14:58:16] <duch_kazatel> awwww.
[14:58:21] <duch_kazatel> or that's why.
[14:58:24] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery preventdefault
[14:58:26] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: event.preventDefault() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/event.preventdefault/
[14:58:29] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[14:58:32] <krizoek> $("bform").submit(function (e) {e.preventDefault();});   where bform is the name of the form
[14:58:41] <duch_kazatel> Earthnail and you're positive the client isn't caching things?
[14:59:05] <Earthnail> duch_kazatel: client == Chrome. I'm not positive, no. I don't know when things are being cached in AJAX.
[14:59:26] <duch_kazatel> Earthnail clear cache - ajax follows the same rules as any other type of request.
[14:59:27] <krizoek> but this didnt seem to prevent it from submitting
[14:59:44] <Earthnail> duch_kazatel: this is a POST request. Shouldn't POST requests never be cached?
[15:00:07] <duch_kazatel> the response to it can be cached.
[15:00:16] <duch_kazatel> not sure if that is relevant.
[15:00:26] <duch_kazatel> but it sounds like your headers are not being set the way you think they are.
[15:00:46] <Earthnail> duch_kazatel: but I can see the correct headers when I make requests manually
[15:00:58] <Earthnail> duch_kazatel: as you could see on that previous screenshot
[15:01:51] <Earthnail> duch_kazatel: is there a way that I can see the request's response in the chrome developer console?
[15:02:04] <Nasp> Earthnail use fiddler
[15:02:10] <duch_kazatel> Earthnail /login and /login/ map to the same thing?
[15:02:16] <Nasp> It's quite awesome for checking http response
[15:02:25] <duch_kazatel> and yes, you can - the network tab.
[15:02:35] <Nasp> Oh well fuck this animation, im just gonna remove it
[15:02:46] <Nasp> Problem solved
[15:02:48] <Earthnail> duch_kazatel: d'oh... indeed. Embarrassing. That happens when you use a microframework -.-
[15:02:53] <Earthnail> duch_kazatel: thanks!
[15:02:59] <duch_kazatel> Earthnail :) you're welcome.
[15:04:21] <krizoek> nevermind, was something in href :)
[15:04:25] <shiftins> can you force a jquery $.ajax deffered to 'fail' with a valid 200 response?
[15:05:55] <shiftins> maybe instead just wrap a promise in an enclosure and reject/resolve from within the success/fail handlers
[15:06:00] <shiftins> i'll try that
[15:06:36] <__joshua__> you can ajax.then(function(){ return $.Defered().reject().promise(); }) probably
[15:09:49] <shiftins> i'm going to do something like x = dosomethig(); dosomething = function() {y = new jQuery.Deferred(); $.ajax({..success: function() {y.reject()}}); return y.promise()}..
[15:10:06] <shiftins> and use it like x.then().fail()

[15:19:50] <Earthnail> duch_kazatel: thanks so much, that solved the problem. Turned out to be quite a silly problem ^^. Thank you very much
[15:20:00] <duch_kazatel> Earthnail deffo.  nbd
[15:21:02] <walidvb> hi guys, i was trying to roll my own solution for a modal vimeo, but that responsive $Hª† is making it painfully painful
[15:22:04] <duch_kazatel> just say "shit" ;)  we all know what you mean.
[15:22:28] <duch_kazatel> hiding it behind some kind of obfuscation doesn't really make a difference.
[15:24:03] <walidvb> any roccomendation for a plugin? I'd like to have quite wide videos
[15:24:13] <walidvb> can't find any good example to fetch their code ;)
[15:24:16] <duch_kazatel> jqmodal is a personal favorite.
[15:24:27] <walidvb> duch_kazatel: yeah i know, i thought i'd still do that ;P
[15:24:48] <walidvb> what bothers me is I don't want to add yet another library to that..
[15:25:04] <duch_kazatel> then write your own lol
[15:26:07] <walidvb> duch_kazatel: from the example jqmodal doesn't resize?
[15:26:18] <duch_kazatel> "doesn't resize" not sure what you mean.
[15:26:30] <duch_kazatel> it's lightweight and flexible - you'll have to create your own rules for it.
[15:26:32] <walidvb> duch_kazatel: yeah i might just do that.. :/ but i was trying to have whole sizing done via css
[15:26:37] <duch_kazatel> well, semi-lightweight.
[15:26:39] <walidvb> duch_kazatel: oh
[15:26:42] <walidvb> aha
[15:48:19] <Ymesio> Hi
[15:48:34] <Ymesio> Really weird thing, select2 is in a jquery-ui dialog
[15:48:49] <Ymesio> It ignores clicking on the elements
[15:49:23] <Ymesio> mousedown event is triggered
[15:49:30] <Ymesio> mouseup event is triggered
[15:49:39] <Ymesio> but not click
[15:49:41] <Ymesio> any ideas?
[15:50:12] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Ymesio
[15:50:12] <b-ot> Ymesio: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:50:44] <erming> Ymesio: try "change" instead of "click"
[15:51:02] <Ymesio> duch_kazatel: Unfortunately I can not, it’s a shitload of backbone views, that I’m not allowed to share
[15:51:30] <duch_kazatel> you could create a small test case that separates out just the piece that's broken.  but meh.
[15:51:32] <Ymesio> erming: I’m talking about list element
[15:52:26] <duch_kazatel> you probably need to init after the dialog launches.
[15:52:41] <Ymesio> duch_kazatel: If I’ll be able to reproduce it, I’ll be able to figure out what was the problem. I may end up doing this eventually, but before that I wondered if anybody saw something like this before
[15:53:00] <Ymesio> duch_kazatel: what do you mean by ‘init’? I apply select 2 after the dialog is open
[15:53:19] <duch_kazatel> i would make sure you have your order of operations correct.
[15:53:27] <duch_kazatel> *double-check to make sure
[15:54:38] <DoctorMonocular> hey everyone -- having a baffling problem. document ready isn't firing. jquery is there, $(document) seems to be returning the right thing, but it never fires. Check this page: http://www.austhentic.com/event/authentic-speed-dating/ -- put a break point inside the document ready of love-juggernaut.js to see what I mean
[15:55:02] <DoctorMonocular> there are 2 unrelated errors on that page too, they are from plugins that I have support tickets out for
[15:55:34] <Ymesio> duch_kazatel: So it created the dialog (which is synchronous), and then applies select2
[15:55:35] <duch_kazatel> actually, those might be cascading into the document ready and causing it to happen.
[15:55:53] <Ymesio> duch_kazatel: anything I could be missing here?
[15:56:09] <duch_kazatel> Ymesio without seeing code, it's impossible for me to say
[15:56:51] <DoctorMonocular> it's wp-content/plugins/love-juggernaut.js if you're looking for it
[15:57:29] <duch_kazatel> DoctorMonocular you've got 5 validation errors, 3 of which seem suspect.
[15:58:39] <duch_kazatel> i'd fix those first.
[15:59:03] <DoctorMonocular> 8/ That's all code that's buried in shitty plugins
[15:59:05] <DoctorMonocular> I can fix it
[15:59:10] <DoctorMonocular> but then I can never upgrade again, haha
[15:59:27] <duch_kazatel> DoctorMonocular i'm not talking about the javascript.
[15:59:35] <duch_kazatel> i'm talking about the html.\
[15:59:40] <DoctorMonocular> me too
[15:59:46] <duch_kazatel>  Bad value http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Lato for attribute href on element link: Illegal character in query: not a URL code point.
[15:59:48] <DoctorMonocular> wordpress plugins is what I'm talking about
[15:59:54] <duch_kazatel>  Start tag h2 seen in table.
[15:59:55] <duch_kazatel> etc
[16:00:17] <DoctorMonocular> right, that's all generated from inside php wordpress plugins. I can change them, but it's a nightmare 8(
[16:00:18] <duch_kazatel> also: try using $(window).on('load', function(){}); instead of document ready and see if maybe that works?
[16:00:25] <DoctorMonocular> ok, trying
[16:00:32] <duch_kazatel> but you've got invalid markup.
[16:01:05] <DoctorMonocular> yeah that fired
[16:01:08] <DoctorMonocular> with the window thing
[16:01:19] <duch_kazatel> then your document is invalid and that's causing your problems.
[16:01:19] <DoctorMonocular> damnit... these are premium plugins too, and they suck shit
[16:01:27] <duch_kazatel> "premium"?
[16:01:30] <DoctorMonocular> puking out invalid markup from directly in the code, it's gross
[16:01:49] <DoctorMonocular> "premium" as in "not free" as in "I give deal, is premium" haha
[16:02:00] <duch_kazatel> oh.  woah.
[16:02:07] <duch_kazatel> didn't realize that was still such a thriving market.
[16:02:14] <duch_kazatel> i'd go yell at the authors.
[16:02:23] <DoctorMonocular> yeah I plan to
[16:09:57] <clueful> I just completed the try.jquery.com tutorial, it was great, it was so nice to actually be taught one of these frameworks in a coherent way rather than puzzling through (mostly badly written) examples on the web
[16:10:30] <clueful> afterwards I was able to write my dynamic form from scratch without really having to consult outside resources and it's much nicer than the examples I had seen previously
[16:11:59] <duch_kazatel> good!
[16:12:07] <duch_kazatel> just rmember, jquery is a library ;)
[16:12:59] <clueful> duch_kazatel: Exactl!
[16:13:02] <clueful> Exactly!
[16:13:37] <clueful> That's why I like it, its not a framework, and I really don't need one, I just need to be able to do some dynamic things in a convenient and browser independent manner
[16:13:54] <duch_kazatel> yep.  its abstractions are precisely for that.
[16:17:23] <EminenceHC> I have $("#did_you_use_div").css("display","none"); which hides a div. I have a separate method which shows a div if a certain boolean field value is set to true. What I cannot figure out how to do is always show the div if the boolean is set to true regardless of change function. How can I achieve this?
[16:18:18] <duch_kazatel> .on('change', function(){ if (aValue){$("#did_you_use_div").css("display","block")}});
[16:18:22] <duch_kazatel> supply some code for context
[16:18:42] <duch_kazatel> unless what you're saying is that you want the div to automatically show when the boolean changes value.
[16:22:18] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: http://pastie.org/9068044 I already have the div automatically show when the boolean changes value using that second method. But if the page is reloaded and the value is set to true I still want the div to be shown. Right now it is only shown on change event.
[16:22:37] <duch_kazatel> then run a check in your document ready to handle the reload case.
[16:23:32] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Is there a reload function or something? It seems like the very first method I use $("#did_you_use_div").css("display","none"); Should only be fired if the form value is not set.
[16:23:54] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: I tried putting it in an if statement but it didn't seem to work.
[16:24:17] <duch_kazatel> that code says "when there is a ready OR page:load event, do these things"
[16:24:32] <duch_kazatel> "reload" would be "ready", since it's reloading everything.
[16:26:40] <duch_kazatel> also, those curlies around $("#did_you_use_div").css("display", "none"); are completely unnecessary.
[16:27:44] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: So how can I make $("#did_you_use_div").css("display","none"); only fire if a certain value is not already set to true?
[16:28:23] <duch_kazatel> if (!value === true) { /* your code here */ }
[16:33:27] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Thanks. I think this is what I want http://pastie.org/9068447 but I can't get the syntax correct. What am I doing wrong?
[16:36:50] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Actually this one is better and seems correct but it doesn't seem to be working: http://pastie.org/9068563
[16:39:21] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:40:28] <duch_kazatel> what is ("[name='drug_assessment[did_you_use]']") supposed to be?
[16:40:55] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: That is the boolean field
[16:41:14] <duch_kazatel> huh?  you realize that's just a string there, right?
[16:41:35] <duch_kazatel> is that supposed to select something?
[16:41:52] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: I do not. Should I be using a class or id?
[16:42:02] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:42:03] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: It is supposed to check the value of that boolean input field.
[16:42:14] <duch_kazatel> "boolean input field" doesn't make sense.
[16:42:31] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: If the value is true, then do nothing, if it is false then run  $("#did_you_use_div").css("display","none");
[16:42:41] <duch_kazatel> ("[name='drug_assessment[did_you_use]']") is supposed to correspond to an input of some kind?
[16:42:45] <duch_kazatel> could you share the html for that input?
[16:42:53] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Yes, a boolean field.
[16:43:44] <duch_kazatel> please share the html then, because i think you're confused about types.
[16:43:45] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: <input checked="checked" class="radio_buttons optional did_you_use regular-radio big-radio" id="drug_assessment_did_you_use_true" name="drug_assessment[did_you_use]" type="radio" value="true">
[16:44:22] <duch_kazatel> $("#drug_assessment_did_you_use_true").val();
[16:45:27] <duch_kazatel> is this in a form of some kind?  a jsfiddle would really be helpful here.
[16:47:03] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Unfortunately I am using ruby on rails, I have something called simple_form that takes ruby and outputs as html.
[16:47:11] <duch_kazatel> if you're just wanting to check if that particular radio is ticked, then you could do if ($("#drug_assessment_did_you_use_true").prop('checked') === 'checked'){}
[16:47:26] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC you can generally send over the html or create a simplified use case, but whatevs.
[16:48:55] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: I will show you all the html it generates, one sec.
[16:49:07] <duch_kazatel> just the relevant bits are necessary.
[16:50:37] <duch_kazatel> brb restart
[16:50:55] <tudda> So i have stepped through all my server side code and I am seeing a <select> returned into my MVC view. Everything looks good, but when i view source using the developer console , the select element has a display:none, and there is an <input tag next to it. I'm assuming some jquery SOMEWHERE is doing this, but we have quite a bit of jquery in place
[16:51:26] <tudda> I can't just turn the jquery off, because quite a bit of it is largely responsible for getting to the point where i can reproduce the issue (modal popups, etc)
[16:52:32] <tudda> So i guess my question is, how can i approach debugging an issue from the HTML side of things.. for instance, halting execution of javascript so that it stops immediately and lets me see the first statement that runs
[16:52:42] <tudda> and allowing me to watch a subset of HTML through each call
[16:53:58] <duch_kazatel> all right, back.
[16:55:33] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: This is the generated html: http://pastie.org/9069027
[16:57:00] <duch_kazatel> okay, so you want to see if one of these are checked?
[16:57:09] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Yeah
[16:58:44] <duch_kazatel> mmk. one sec.
[17:00:46] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: I was able to add id="foo" to both of them if that helps.
[17:00:54] <duch_kazatel> you all ready have ids on these.
[17:05:17] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/up8ng/
[17:06:59] <duch_kazatel> also - you can only use an ID once per page.
[17:07:55] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: That code does not seem to be working for me.
[17:08:04] <duch_kazatel> are you looking at your console?
[17:08:21] <duch_kazatel> also this: http://jsfiddle.net/up8ng/1/
[17:09:13] <duch_kazatel> this code just tells you if something is or isn't checked.
[17:10:08] <duch_kazatel> also: make sure it's in a document ready.
[17:10:57] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Ok cool that does log in the console correctly if the form is reloaded
[17:11:22] <duch_kazatel> so you said you want to hide it if it HASN'T been filled out, right?
[17:11:26] <duch_kazatel> and nothing if it has been?
[17:11:28] <duch_kazatel> or something?
[17:11:32] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Correct
[17:12:08] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: If it has been filled out, and it is true, I want it to not hide.
[17:12:32] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/up8ng/3/
[17:14:02] <duch_kazatel> but depending on your logic, i might change that.
[17:17:25] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: That is exactly what I want. Thank you so much for your time and patience, I really appreciate it.
[17:17:53] <duch_kazatel> sure.  beware of lines 10 - 14.  that might be confusing if you're not careful.
[17:41:13] <Rainb> can you put parenthesis into queries
[17:41:19] <Rainb> in selectors
[17:41:22] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Rainb
[17:41:22] <b-ot> Rainb: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:42:01] <Rainb> as in uhm, the selector "div>(div,ul)"
[17:42:20] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[17:43:16] <Rainb> how would I select the children elements of div that are either div or ul
[17:44:55] <duch_kazatel> $('div > div, div > ul')
[17:48:05] <Rainb> ohh, so would ".class1,.class2>div" select the elements with class "class1" and all the elements div that are children of the class "class2" instead of selecting all the children div elements of either class1 or class2?
[17:48:28] <duch_kazatel> yes
[17:49:50] <duch_kazatel> just like in css.
[17:50:05] <duch_kazatel> and > is not "children", it's "direct descendent" btw
[17:50:43] <Rainb> I got used to the DOM api, I suppose
[17:50:57] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:53:18] <Rainb> You know Element.children
[17:55:45] <duch_kazatel> that returns an htmlcollection, so i'm not sure what you mean by that.
[17:56:46] <duch_kazatel> ah i see what you mean now.
[18:49:13] <SackLunch94[DAL]> Any pros on tonight?
[18:49:20] <SackLunch94[DAL]> got a head scratcher I can't google out
[18:49:34] <abjorn> maybe, but I can try regardless :)
[18:49:48] <SackLunch94[DAL]> lol
[18:49:48] <SackLunch94[DAL]> ok
[18:51:10] <SackLunch94[DAL]> I've made a form in Yii (php framework).. and it makes two inputs..
[18:51:23] <SackLunch94[DAL]> problem is.. they're given the same ID
[18:51:25] <SackLunch94[DAL]> http://bpaste.net/show/UYdTMIFvD5FCnuq94OSH/
[18:51:33] <SackLunch94[DAL]> as shown there..
[18:52:02] <abjorn> and the same name :|
[18:52:12] <SackLunch94[DAL]> I need to get the value out of the text box.. and put it in another text box that's built the same way
[18:52:41] <SackLunch94[DAL]> there's got to be a way to specify that I want the information from a text field, not a label
[18:52:46] <SackLunch94[DAL]> err. hidden field
[18:52:58] <abjorn> I mean my first instinct would be to get Yii to not output such crappy inputs, but failing that
[18:53:31] <abjorn> there is the != selector
[18:53:42] <SackLunch94[DAL]> That's some internal work there I don't want to deal with at the moment
[18:53:57] <SackLunch94[DAL]> plus I think it needs it for validation
[18:54:06] <abjorn> or :not()
[18:54:26] <abjorn> (mental note not to use yii)
[18:54:53] <abjorn> if you can rely on the class on one of those elements id use that though
[18:54:59] <abjorn> first one has no class, second has .form-control
[18:55:22] <abjorn> *I'd
[19:01:24] <SackLunch94[DAL]> lol
[19:01:26] <SackLunch94[DAL]> yii is bad ass
[19:01:37] <SackLunch94[DAL]> I'm just trying to do something it didn't intend
[19:02:00] <SackLunch94[DAL]> lots of them have form-control
[19:02:06] <SackLunch94[DAL]> that's bootstrap 3.0
[19:12:22] <rvrsh3ll^away> Is there a better way to open another webpage inside a frame/area than <iframe>?
[19:37:18] <BillCriswell> rvrsh3ll^away: I think that's as good as it gets.
[19:38:21] <rvrsh3ll^away> alrighty
[19:49:31] <eindoofus> hi, I'm a bit confused about the parenthesis in this example: http://jsfiddle.net/R6L6A/  (function() { ... } ());
[19:52:07] <craig9> Hi - how can I create multiple select elements, and clone into them the option elements from a 'master' select, on the fly, without disturbing previous selections?
[19:53:00] <craig9> At the moment, all these select elements have the same name, and I was going to treat the posted data as an array in PHP, not that the PHP part matters.
[19:53:45] <BillCriswell> eindoofus: It's just a function that executes immediately.
[19:54:22] <eindoofus> thanks BillCriswell
[19:54:59] <eindoofus> are the first and last parenthesis necessary?
[19:55:06] <BillCriswell> eindoofus: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression
[19:56:15] <BillCriswell> eindoofus: They are.
[19:56:26] <shoky> craig9: var options = $('#masterSelect').children();  $('.slaveSelect').each(function() { options.clone().appendTo(this) })
[19:57:25] <craig9> shoky, thanks, I have something like that working right now, the issue I have is I am creating an undetermined number of slave select elements, and the appendTo is appending to existing selects, when I create a new select.
[19:57:51] <craig9> So when I create the first, all is good. When I create the second, I am also appending to the first, again, and it has twice the required option children.
[19:58:01] <craig9> And so on
[19:58:09] <shoky> then don't select the first one again
[19:58:55] <shoky> make a fiddle if you want us to fiddle
[19:59:10] <craig9> I'm a jquery novice, which I didn't mention before. I'm having trouble understanding the problem even.
[19:59:48] <craig9> I have created a hack where I set the class to 'foox' on the newly created select, and then immediately change it to 'foo', and then it is not appended to in future, but it seems like a poor solution.
[20:00:19] <craig9> There's ajax and private info and so on in the app, so it's not easy to create a fiddle.
[20:04:21] <craig9> Nevermind, I thought there might be an easy answer, but the hack is working, I will revisit it later if I have time. Thanks anyway.
[20:05:24] <shoky> craig9: create the new select into a variable,  var select = $('<select>');
[20:05:39] <shoky> craig9: then you can do select.append(whatever)  or whatever.appendTo(select)
[20:06:05] <shoky> instead of querying the DOM for all selects, which i guess is what you're doing now
[20:06:17] <craig9> shoky, that's a great idea, I can work with that. Should have thought of it myself. I'm brand new to js and jquery. Thanks for the point in the right direction.
[20:06:31] <craig9> Yes - I am just doing $('.foo')...
[20:07:20] <shoky> craig9: here's the same idea using chaining instead of storing into a var:  http://jsfiddle.net/gzf8n/
[20:08:43] <craig9> That's very neat. Thanks, I will use your example with some mods if you don't mind?
[20:08:57] <shoky> sure ;p
[20:09:39] <craig9> Thanks for your help and the code
[20:09:54] <shoky> no probs
[20:28:48] <ratmav> i have an optgroup, and i am showing and hiding the children of an optgroup based on the input from another field. for some reason, if one of the optgroups gets too long, scrolling no longer works for the other optgroups. what am i doing wrong?
[20:46:46] <zagaza`> hi.. totally new to jquery.. if I want to add more than 1 selector, $latestPost.fadeOut(300, function() how would I do? can I do $latestPost, $someOtherPost.fadeOut(300, function()  ?
[20:49:26] <zagaza`> figured out.. its $latestPost.fadeOut, $someOtherPost.fadeOut(300, function() right?
[21:34:22] <stoyvo> Me things $.ajax is broken. 406 HTTP error code does not classify as a .fail()
[21:34:32] <stoyvo> thinks*
[22:38:06] <unnu> msg nickserv identify 1234!@#$1234!@#$
[22:38:10] <unnu> fuck
[22:38:50] <Uhkis> that's one lazy password :D
[22:38:53] <mehwork> i have a checkbox that says 'I agree' and i only want to attach a click handler to my 'continue' button if it's checked. How can i do this?
[22:38:53] <unnu> lol
[22:38:54] <unnu> yeah
[22:40:54] <unnu> msg nickserv identify 1234!@#$1234!@#$
[22:41:00] <mehwork> i can get it to work by doing a click handler on the checkbox and then assigning a click handler to the button if ($(this).is(':checked')) but if a user clicks, unclicks, and clicks the checkbox again, then the button click handler files for each time
[22:41:30] <unnu> damn you script
[22:41:32] <unnu> lol
[22:42:31] <Uhkis> mehwork: $(#yourbutton).on('click', function() { if (iagree.is(':checked') == 1) dosomething } );
[22:42:58] <Uhkis> $(iagree).is(':checked')
[22:43:00] <unnu> ALRIGHTY THEN
[22:43:14] <unnu> forgot to put a / in my login button XD
[22:43:16] <Uhkis> unnu: you may wanna change that password already :D
[22:43:34] <unnu> what password?
[22:43:36] <unnu> nickserv?
[22:43:40] <unnu> fixed it already
[22:43:48] <Uhkis> good
[22:43:53] <unnu> yeah, lol tell me about it
[22:44:02] <mehwork> Uhkis: thanks
[22:44:21] <unnu> i made some macro buttons, and thought : i will make a login button so i dont have to send that command to nickserv every time
[22:44:24] <unnu> nope
[22:44:28] <unnu> forgot the /
[22:44:30] <unnu> XD
[22:45:09] <unnu> anyway, on to my problem
[22:45:27] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/7se39/
[22:45:51] <unnu> how does one make the mouseleave remove the download button?
[22:46:40] <unnu> should i use childeren perhaps? now that i think about it doesn't find go up the dom?
[22:47:53] <unnu> idk i am lost
[22:49:43] <fattest> Hey cork, its fattest again
[22:50:10] <fattest> Cork: I moved on with two tables now, and i was wondering wheter it was possible to make it work for both the tables without copy pasting the function or table again? http://jsbin.com/moxenoci/11/edit
[22:55:34] <Uhkis> unnu: i'd do this: http://jsfiddle.net/7se39/1/ or just hide()
[22:59:38] <therealklanni> Does jQuery still not work to select on a document fragment? ( $('div', myDocumentFragment) or some such )
[23:05:41] <unnu> Uhkis: thank you
[23:07:03] <Cork> therealklanni: "still" it has always worked
[23:07:20] <therealklanni> Not according to Resig
[23:07:32] <Cork> then they don't know what they're talking about
[23:07:41] <therealklanni> John Resig? lol
[23:08:08] <Cork> therealklanni: jquery uses fragments for none attached parsed segments
[23:08:20] <therealklanni> I know it USES fragments
[23:08:35] <Cork> and you can select on that fragment
[23:08:56] <therealklanni> Give me an example
[23:09:26] <Cork> $('<div><span id="me">content</span></div>').find('#me').text()
[23:10:38] <therealklanni> That's not the same thing
[23:11:13] <Cork> it is
[23:11:20] <Cork> $() creates a fragment
[23:11:25] <therealklanni> I want to select ON a documentFragment, not create a fragment and select
[23:11:34] <Cork> ...
[23:11:37] <Cork> oook
[23:11:43] <therealklanni> See my example in my initial question
[23:11:46] <Cork> var fragment = $('<div><span id="me">content</span></div>')[0]
[23:11:53] <Cork> $(fragment).find('#me')
[23:13:23] <therealklanni> No
[23:13:23] <Jattenalle> therealklanni, $('.fragment').find('#something) ?
[23:13:51] <Cork> Jattenalle: no he wants to search in a fragment
[23:14:00] <Cork> meaning a set of dom elements that arn't in the page
[23:14:08] <therealklanni> frag=document.createDocumentFragment(); frag.appendChild(document.createElement('div')); $(frag).find('div') // => []
[23:14:29] <therealklanni> See https://forum.jquery.com/topic/using-find-method-on-a-documentfragment-attached-node#14737000000469261
[23:14:37] <Jattenalle> ooh
[23:14:56] <therealklanni> It's from 4 years ago, so that's why I was asking if that's still the case (John says jQuery doesn't support it, as of 4 years ago)
[23:15:07] <therealklanni> But maybe that's changed (so far it doesn't seem like it)
[23:15:40] <Jattenalle> well, it's not a jquery thing, it's browsers not implementing it as a full DOM feature set
[23:16:00] <Jattenalle> just like his post says, also no idea if browsers have gotten better at it or not
[23:16:57] <Cork> therealklanni: $(frag.childNodes).filter('div')
[23:17:13] <therealklanni> That's not exactly the same thing
[23:17:22] <Cork> ya, but it is close enough
[23:17:22] <therealklanni> I can filter an array just fine without jQuery
[23:17:44] <therealklanni> I am checking to see if jQuery natively supports it, but I guess I have my answer
[23:17:55] <Cork> therealklanni: your missing the point
[23:18:02] <Jattenalle> it's not about jquery "supporting" something... it's just not there
[23:18:04] <Jattenalle> it doesnt exist :/
[23:18:07] <Cork> you use filter for first level children
[23:18:13] <Jattenalle> can't support something the browser doesnt implement :/
[23:18:14] <therealklanni> No, you're missing the point
[23:18:16] <Cork> and .find for second+ elements
[23:19:02] <therealklanni> Jattenalle: please stop, you're not being helpful... jQuery could support it regardless if all browsers support it... that's kind of the idea (at least originally) behind jQuery... and jQuery itself uses it, so....
[23:19:13] <Jattenalle> well good luck
[23:19:26] <therealklanni> Thanks anyway
[23:19:50] <Cork> therealklanni: var frag=document.createDocumentFragment(), div = document.createElement('div'); div.appendChild(document.createElement('span')); frag.appendChild(div); $(frag.childNodes).find('span')
[23:21:45] <therealklanni> Cork: that'll do :) thanks
[23:22:06] <Cork> therealklanni: jquery works with nodes not full documents
[23:22:15] <Cork> therealklanni: that is why you need to do that little dance
[23:22:21] <therealklanni> Right
[23:22:48] <Cork> just remember that the first level is .filter and everything should work fine
[23:23:47] <fattest> Cork: can you please have a look at my issue cork?
[23:24:16] <Cork> fattest: not unless you ask the question
[23:24:28] <fattest> Cork: i did ask the question...
[23:24:43] <fattest> Cork:  I moved on with two tables now, and i was wondering wheter it was possible to make it work for both the tables without copy pasting the function or table again? http://jsbin.com/moxenoci/11/edit
[23:25:13] <fattest> Cork: i need two tables to be sorted instead of one, and i was wondering whether it was possible to do it without copy pasting the function.
[23:25:17] <therealklanni> Hmm, now it's not working
[23:27:02] <Cork> fattest: that depends heavily on what the plugin does
[23:27:12] <Cork> fattest: it might support it, or it might not
[23:27:20] <Cork> that's more then i know
[23:27:25] <fattest> Cork: oh
[23:27:36] <fattest> i'll try in #angularjs
[23:28:32] <therealklanni> Ah, there we go, I guess the reason it wasn't working for me in the first place (why I ended up googling and then ultimately asking here) is the frag needs to have a wrapper element around whatever elements I want jQuery to be able to select within that. And I wasn't thinking of needing the nodes. So 2 things
[23:29:21] <Cork> therealklanni: well no, if you want to search on the outer most section you need to use .filter
[23:29:29] <Cork> i've told you this three times now
[23:30:04] <therealklanni> All you've said is "the first level is .filter" how am I supposed to know that's what you meant
[23:30:27] <Cork> therealklanni: jquery builds a list of the outer most parents
[23:30:37] <Cork> those needs to be searched with filter
[23:30:47] <Cork> children of these elements is searched with .find
[23:30:54] <therealklanni> That's exactly what I just said
[23:31:06] <Cork> no you said you needed to add a wrapper
[23:31:10] <Cork> and that isn't correct
[23:31:20] <therealklanni> I'm saying for what I'm doing
[23:34:21] <therealklanni> Simply doing $(frag.childNodes).filter('div') wasn't doing anything for me
[23:35:34] <therealklanni> Adding a div around that and doing instead $('div', frag.childNodes) was working
[23:49:43] <tehturner> Hello! Could you tell me, what is the "best" way of "remembering" positions of draggable elements between sessions? Cookies or other means?
