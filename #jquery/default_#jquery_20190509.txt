[00:52:09] <primitivMedia> having issues with the following code
[00:52:11] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/674d14186b6b
[00:52:29] <primitivMedia> form seems to be ignoring the onsubmit function
[00:52:47] <robertmaxrees> hi :)
[00:52:50] <robertmaxrees> what's the markup?
[00:53:10] <robertmaxrees> what if you do a console.log($form4.length) right before that .on()?
[00:53:33] <robertmaxrees> (also fwiw you can just do  $form4.on('submit', function(e){ since form4 is a jquery object already)
[00:54:19] <robertmaxrees> primitivMedia ^
[00:58:06] <primitivMedia> is that not what I'm currently doing?
[00:58:22] <primitivMedia> the for $form4
[00:59:12] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/4421d6679ffc
[00:59:14] <primitivMedia> this is my markup
[01:00:07] <robertmaxrees> you're doing $($form4) which is redundant
[01:00:18] <primitivMedia> just realised and changed :P
[01:00:36] <robertmaxrees> :)
[01:00:46] <primitivMedia> still no change
[01:00:46] <robertmaxrees> so what about the console log i suggested?
[01:00:55] <primitivMedia> how do i display the lenght of form4 if i dont have a trigger?
[01:01:04] <primitivMedia> if i put it before the .con
[01:01:08] <primitivMedia> .on*
[01:01:11] <robertmaxrees> you... don't need a trigger?
[01:01:17] <robertmaxrees> it should show on pageload.
[01:01:51] <robertmaxrees> is this getting dynamically created?
[01:01:56] <primitivMedia> returns 0
[01:02:05] <primitivMedia> yes it is
[01:02:10] <robertmaxrees> ah-hah
[01:02:12] <robertmaxrees> that's your issue.
[01:02:19] <robertmaxrees> you need a delegated handler.
[01:02:22] <primitivMedia> caused me issues earlier with something else as well
[01:02:31] <primitivMedia> my on click
[01:02:32] <primitivMedia> oh wait
[01:02:34] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[01:02:41] <primitivMedia> im a dummy
[01:02:46] <robertmaxrees> ?
[01:02:48] <primitivMedia> i literally had the answer in my script above higher
[01:02:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[01:02:57] <primitivMedia>  $(document).on('click', 'span.displayMe',function(){
[01:03:01] <primitivMedia> this right?
[01:03:10] <robertmaxrees> yes but - bind lower if you can.
[01:03:14] <primitivMedia> lol it shows I'm tired and shouldnt be working
[01:03:23] <robertmaxrees> don't bind to document or body or w/e
[01:03:41] <robertmaxrees> unless you really have to.
[01:04:36] <primitivMedia>         $form4.on('submit', '.mb-40', function(e){
[01:04:40] <primitivMedia> this should b good?
[01:05:32] <robertmaxrees> err
[01:05:39] <robertmaxrees> no - because $form4 still doesn't exist.
[01:05:49] <robertmaxrees> bind to whatever you're appending it to.
[01:06:04] <primitivMedia> sorry I'm half R****** sometimes
[01:06:08] <primitivMedia> i smoke way too much
[01:06:14] <robertmaxrees> okay okay chill
[01:06:16] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[01:06:24] <primitivMedia> so am i looking for an element after or before?
[01:06:37] <robertmaxrees> a parent element that exists on pageload.
[01:06:44] <primitivMedia> OH
[01:06:46] <robertmaxrees> like the docs tell you to.
[01:06:55] <robertmaxrees> the same docs i linked before ;)
[01:07:26] <primitivMedia> .col.s12.m6.l5 is before my for each
[01:07:29] <primitivMedia> should work
[01:07:38] <robertmaxrees> no idea what you mean by that but ok
[01:07:59] <primitivMedia> still doesnt work
[01:08:19] <robertmaxrees> so you're appending that form
[01:08:20] <primitivMedia> why cant i do what i did earlier to get my on click to work?
[01:08:24] <primitivMedia> like the one i showed you
[01:08:25] <robertmaxrees> what are you appending it to?
[01:08:28] <primitivMedia> that one worked fine...
[01:08:37] <robertmaxrees> you can bind to document, but it's generally a bad idea.
[01:08:50] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/777fef850d3f
[01:08:52] <primitivMedia> this works fine
[01:08:54] <robertmaxrees> binding a bunch of listners globally can eventually get really buggy and nonperformant
[01:08:56] <primitivMedia> i had to  do the same thing
[01:09:13] <robertmaxrees> so instead you bind to whatever parent element exists on pageload.
[01:09:25] <robertmaxrees> if you read the docs i linked, they explain it in depth
[01:09:45] <primitivMedia> div.mb-40 is there on page load
[01:10:00] <primitivMedia> span.displayMe
[01:10:01] <primitivMedia> ***
[01:10:21] <robertmaxrees> also: 1 - don't prepend classes/ids with tagnames, and 2 - add a semantic classname
[01:10:45] <robertmaxrees> but so long as you bind to an ancestor element that exists on pageload, it will work.
[01:12:27] <primitivMedia> does that noly work for on clicks
[01:12:31] <primitivMedia> cuz im doing on submit
[01:12:32] <robertmaxrees> no.
[01:12:36] <robertmaxrees> it works for all events.
[01:12:42] <primitivMedia> OK so what am i doing wrong
[01:12:42] <robertmaxrees> like the docs i linked explain
[01:12:44] <primitivMedia> i have my form
[01:12:50] <primitivMedia> and im using a parent element
[01:12:50] <robertmaxrees> show me code
[01:13:06] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/ce657fac05b4
[01:13:09] <robertmaxrees> does that parent exist on pageload?
[01:13:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[01:13:19] <primitivMedia> it should yes
[01:13:22] <primitivMedia> it's hard coded
[01:13:24] <robertmaxrees> you're appending the form, right?
[01:13:24] <primitivMedia> in html
[01:13:43] <primitivMedia> my form is a lot of things currently
[01:13:43] <robertmaxrees> did you even read the docs i linked?
[01:13:46] <primitivMedia> yes
[01:13:53] <robertmaxrees> no, you didn't.
[01:13:57] <robertmaxrees> var $form4 = $("form[name=packageForm]"); - you're appending this.
[01:14:01] <robertmaxrees> this does not exist on pageload.
[01:14:05] <robertmaxrees> so doing that won't work.
[01:14:18] <robertmaxrees> is "div.mb-40" the parent that exists on pageload?
[01:15:10] <robertmaxrees> because it goes $('parentSelector').on('event', 'dynamicallyAppendedChild', function() {});
[01:15:36] <primitivMedia> so i swap them
[01:15:44] <robertmaxrees> not just swap though.
[01:16:07] <primitivMedia> but yes div.mb-40 is the parent element of the form itself
[01:16:10] <robertmaxrees> when you do var $foo = $('someSelector') - this only captures whatever exists when you run it, which in your case is pagelod.
[01:16:14] <robertmaxrees> *pageload
[01:16:23] <robertmaxrees> so you can't store that in a var.
[01:17:43] <primitivMedia> alright
[01:18:11] <primitivMedia> I'm still confused as to what i need to do sorru
[01:18:13] <primitivMedia> sorry**
[01:18:19] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[01:18:50] <robertmaxrees> $('div.mb40').on('submit', 'form[name="packageForm"]', function() {});
[01:19:03] <robertmaxrees> read the docs,  they explain it all.
[01:21:05] <primitivMedia> that still doesnt work
[01:21:23] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('div.mb40').length);
[01:21:27] <robertmaxrees> right before.
[01:21:31] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?>
[01:21:54] <primitivMedia> 0
[01:22:00] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[01:22:04] <robertmaxrees> so is this code in a doc ready?
[01:22:13] <robertmaxrees> or in the <head> of the page?
[01:22:22] <robertmaxrees> are you dynamically creating div.mb40?
[01:23:19] <Slyda1> query the J
[01:23:46] <robertmaxrees> Slyda1 ?
[01:25:54] <Slyda1> they did bad things to J
[01:25:59] <robertmaxrees> 'k...
[01:26:08] <Slyda1> maybe you will know
[01:26:16] <robertmaxrees> ?
[01:26:19] <Slyda1> its good to know things isnt it?
[01:26:46] <primitivMedia> i dont think so
[01:26:48] <primitivMedia> its in my html
[01:26:58] <robertmaxrees> primitivMedia so what about my first 2 questions?
[01:26:59] <robertmaxrees> :)
[01:27:08] <primitivMedia> oh wait its in my php for each nvm
[01:27:32] <robertmaxrees> php runs before it gets sent to the client.
[01:27:34] <Slyda1> you guys will always know won''t you
[01:27:45] <robertmaxrees> Slyda1 did you have a questions or something?
[01:27:55] <Slyda1> when will it stop. when will it start.
[01:29:38] <primitivMedia> OK length returned 3
[01:29:40] <primitivMedia> for section-content
[01:29:43] <primitivMedia> div.section-content **
[01:29:59] <robertmaxrees> so problem solved?
[01:30:22] <primitivMedia> no
[01:30:32] <primitivMedia>            var $form4 = $('form[name=packageForm]');
[01:30:39] <robertmaxrees> and again
[01:30:44] <robertmaxrees> you cannot store that in a var
[01:30:49] <robertmaxrees> because it does not exist on pageload.
[01:30:55] <primitivMedia>      url: $form4.attr("action"),
[01:30:56] <robertmaxrees> which is when your code is running.,
[01:31:00] <primitivMedia> how do i do this then?
[01:31:07] <robertmaxrees> show me a paste of the entire snippet
[01:31:22] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/5d65beea3614
[01:31:47] <robertmaxrees> so $(this) is a jquery object that refers back to the element that emitted the event
[01:32:12] <robertmaxrees> so you can do $(this).attr('action') etc.
[01:32:30] <robertmaxrees> within the submit handler.
[01:34:10] <primitivMedia> i click the button
[01:34:11] <primitivMedia> still submits
[01:34:15] <primitivMedia> doesnt register
[01:34:25] <robertmaxrees> code
[01:34:28] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/aee9cd51dde6
[01:34:32] <primitivMedia> i added simple alert
[01:34:35] <primitivMedia> and remove ajax
[01:34:41] <robertmaxrees> before that
[01:34:55] <primitivMedia> which code do you want
[01:34:58] <primitivMedia> all js?
[01:35:00] <robertmaxrees> wait.,
[01:35:13] <robertmaxrees> so you're sure the form is in that div?
[01:35:22] <robertmaxrees> it need to be a descendent of it.
[01:35:50] <robertmaxrees> *needs
[01:36:17] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/2d73256d111e
[01:36:20] <primitivMedia> heres part of the html
[01:36:34] <robertmaxrees> wait wait wait
[01:36:48] <robertmaxrees> you realize the php runs before this gets sent to the browser, right?
[01:37:14] <robertmaxrees> also: ng-if - are you using angular, as well?
[01:37:38] <primitivMedia> yes
[01:37:43] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[01:37:45] <primitivMedia> its a module I'm tweaking not mine lol
[01:37:47] <robertmaxrees> don't use jquery at all then.
[01:37:52] <robertmaxrees> use angular.
[01:38:00] <primitivMedia> i dont know angular this is easier
[01:38:04] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[01:38:08] <robertmaxrees> obviously it's not ;)
[01:38:11] <primitivMedia> why is this the only form that doesn't work?
[01:38:15] <primitivMedia> all my toher 3 forms work fine
[01:38:19] <primitivMedia> other**
[01:38:26] <robertmaxrees> use angular - it's doing things to the page that are messing you up.
[01:38:59] <primitivMedia> I'm not learning angular i have no use for it besides this module using it
[01:39:02] <primitivMedia> rest of app doesnt use it
[01:39:05] <primitivMedia> im good on angular
[01:39:13] <primitivMedia> one my ajax works the rest is done
[01:39:20] <primitivMedia> im not about to restart because of one form not working??
[01:39:29] <robertmaxrees> if the module uses it and you want to modify that module, then you need to learn it.
[01:39:39] <robertmaxrees> that's where your problems start.
[01:39:41] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[01:39:43] <primitivMedia> it's clearly some small erro or mistake ill fix it eventually if not tonight im not too worried
[01:39:59] <robertmaxrees> lmfao.
[01:40:02] <robertmaxrees> glhf kbye
[02:01:40] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/82f098389966
[02:01:45] <primitivMedia> got it working using document
[02:02:06] <primitivMedia> now my values dont seem to working
[02:03:06] <robertmaxrees> and again
[02:03:16] <robertmaxrees> var $form4 = $("form[name=packageForm]"); isn't doing what you think it is.
[02:03:23] <robertmaxrees> you need to use $(this) within the function instead.
[02:04:30] <primitivMedia> i changed that to $this
[02:04:40] <primitivMedia> my click fires the alert
[02:04:49] <primitivMedia> its just the two var that are returning NaN
[02:04:55] <robertmaxrees> show the code.
[02:05:07] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/28490c410002
[02:05:16] <primitivMedia> so alert gets triggered
[02:05:25] <primitivMedia> just variables dont work
[02:05:28] <robertmaxrees> also: .val() returns strings.
[02:06:04] <robertmaxrees> and also
[02:06:11] <robertmaxrees> $(document).on('submit', $form4,function(e){ won't work.
[02:06:20] <robertmaxrees> are you going to read the docs or what?
[02:06:38] <primitivMedia> it triggers my alert which didnt happen before?
[02:06:43] <robertmaxrees> are you going to read the docs or what?
[02:07:05] <primitivMedia> I did, I'm not sure what I'm missing
[06:35:23] <Northwoods> How do we deal with session timeout on client side , is it good to do AJAX request after certain time interval to check session , any other alternative ?
[07:05:33] <Northwoods> How do we deal with session timeout on client side , is it good to do AJAX request after certain time interval to check session , any other alternative ?
[07:14:48] <Cork> Northwoods: one option is to open a websocket connection to the server and have the server close it when the session times out
[07:15:04] <Cork> or use ServerEvent (long pull)

[07:38:31] <hirsty> Hi folks, seem to be having a strange issue on IE11 with jquery ui....console is returning Unable to get property 'version' of undefined or null reference - but on running $.ui.version in the console, the version is returning fine :/
[07:39:50] <Cork> hirsty: make sure you have loaded jquery-ui before you're trying to use it
[07:44:14] <hirsty> its showing that error within the jquery-ui.js?
[07:45:24] <hirsty> a patch file for it or something
[07:48:27] <Cork> hard so say, it doesn't really make sense to get the error from jquery-ui
[08:14:49] <Zvan> What am I doing wrong here? https://jsfiddle.net/508nprbt/
[08:25:50] <fr4zz> Hey
[11:20:33] <z1haze> when attaching event handlers like this: $postal.on('input', doGeoAssist) -- is the context of `this` in the function going to be the element still?
[11:20:46] <Cork> yes
[11:21:28] <z1haze> even if the function is defined as an arrow function?
[11:21:39] <robertmaxrees> you can't set 'this' using arrow functions.
[11:21:42] <robertmaxrees> so no.
[11:21:44] <Cork> ya
[11:21:54] <z1haze> ok that's what i thought
[11:22:12] <Cork> well the question didn't reflect in the line you gave
[11:22:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:22:22] <Cork> you just gave a function as a reference :/
[11:22:35] <z1haze> yeah i know, i had to go back and look again because your answer was different than what i was expecting
[11:22:40] <z1haze> my bad
[11:23:18] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, where is you ^
[11:23:27] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[11:23:42] <z1haze> you seem to enjoy placing little ^ messages on just about everything
[11:23:46] <z1haze> figured id get one there too
[11:23:55] <z1haze> :)
[11:24:06] <robertmaxrees> lol easy way to say "this" :)
[13:31:28] <z1haze> if $el.find('.some-el').change(onchangefunc) the same as $el.find('.some-el').each(function() { $(this).change(onchangefunc) }) ?
[13:31:46] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[13:31:46] <taplar> effectively, yes
[13:31:54] <z1haze> eg if you have a jquery selector that has multiple elements in it and you call .change on it does it run for each of them indiependently?
[13:31:59] <robertmaxrees> yes
[13:32:02] <z1haze> wonderful ty
[13:32:11] <taplar> most jQuery methods do
[13:32:14] <robertmaxrees> with many jquery elements, the "each" is implied
[13:38:21] <Jasein> I got the menu to close when off-clicked thanks robertmaxrees. but when scaling the screen, it's showing the active state of the menu for a second. Any ideas why? https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/QRjmdP?editors=1111
[13:38:37] <robertmaxrees> "when scaling the screen"?
[13:39:00] <z1haze> is it normal that change listeners fire on load?
[13:39:17] <taplar> not normally
[13:39:18] <robertmaxrees> z1haze not unless something is changing the element on load
[13:39:31] <Jasein> dragging the screen width from >720 to <720...sorry
[13:39:35] <z1haze> ok, hm
[13:40:13] <robertmaxrees> Jasein i'm not seeing that issue.
[13:40:13] <taplar> z1haze change event is only thrown if the user changes something, or the logic manually triggers one
[13:40:31] <robertmaxrees> Jasein ooooh i just saw it happen.
[13:40:37] <robertmaxrees> that's a CSS issue :)
[13:46:15] <Jasein> drats. Thanks for your help.
[13:47:40] <z1haze> so it seems to run on load if i write the code using the .each.
[13:47:50] <z1haze> $(this).find('.country').change(updateValidation); does not run on load
[13:48:01] <robertmaxrees> z1haze then something else is going on
[13:48:18] <z1haze> $(this).find('.country').each(function () { $(this).change(updateValidation) }); this runs on load
[13:48:37] <robertmaxrees> gotta fiddle that shows that being the case?
[13:48:46] <z1haze> ill have to make one
[13:48:50] <z1haze> prolly wont be able to replicate heh
[14:07:04] <z1haze> yeah, cant replicate
[14:07:05] <z1haze> hmm
[14:11:23] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:19:57] <z1haze> wondering how to solve this.. a select element is loaded serverside with a list of options, just assume i dont have the ability serverside to inject a 'blank' Choose your option element. I am inserting the blank option on load, but is there a way to know if the select on load actually had a selected value?
[14:20:33] <z1haze> for example the dropdown is for us state. the first state is alabama, so i need a way to know if alabama was ACTUALLY selected vs defaulted to because there was no previous option
[14:20:43] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to store that somewhere.
[14:20:48] <z1haze> damn
[14:20:49] <z1haze> ok
[14:33:29] <taplar> you might could test that
[14:33:41] <taplar> depending on if your markup is generated differently
[14:34:05] <taplar> like, it could be the default if none of the options have the selected attribute
[14:34:39] <taplar> *if* actually choosing it puts that on it for the next load
[16:20:57] <znf> Hi. I have a weird issue with some very very very old code (antiqued at this point) - https://orasulsuceava.ro/ - the "Evenimente" (orange) frame should animate left/right when using the mousewheel to scroll; yet, it works in Chrome, but not in Firefox, and I can't seem to figure out why
[16:21:42] <robertmaxrees> znf can you share a fiddle with just the relevant code?
[16:21:51] <znf> robertmaxrees, honestly, I doubt it
[16:22:27] <znf> absolutely 0 documentation for the code, and the guy who wrote it 10 years ago is obviously missing in action
[16:22:39] <robertmaxrees> i mean, i was just able to find it soooo... lol
[16:22:52] <znf> meaning that I really don't understand the code
[16:22:55] <robertmaxrees> did you change anything recently that caused it to break?
[16:23:24] <znf> that's the thing - I'm not even sure it used to work before; the only change I did recently was to upgrade this CMS from Wordpress 3.x to 5.2
[16:23:31] <znf> So that might mean the jQuery version upgraded

[16:23:51] <znf> yes
[16:24:08] <robertmaxrees> that's the code.  i would check that the delta is what you think it is.
[16:24:32] <znf> but why would it work on chrome? :-/
[16:25:04] <robertmaxrees> could be that extractDelta() isn't working properly.
[16:25:48] <znf> yeah, delta returns undefined in firefox
[16:25:58] <robertmaxrees> then there's your issue :)
[16:26:50] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:27:31] <dr4ken> folks, if i have some HTML in another html file that is not my index.html, and i want to put that inside a <div id="foo"> how can i do that with JQuery?
[16:27:56] <taplar> is the html in the other file a complete document, or a fragment?
[16:29:08] <dr4ken> taplar, a fragment
[16:29:32] <taplar> then you can just $('#foo').load('urlToOtherHtmlFile')
[16:29:52] <dr4ken> im actually going to recycle a bootstrap modal, by just appending the correct modal body content by which button the user presses
[16:30:17] <dr4ken> taplar, ty, gonna checkout that
[16:30:23] <taplar> i was just asking because my answer would have been the same, but I would have advised you to turn it into a fragment if it was not, :)
[16:30:38] <dr4ken> oh, sweet :P
[16:32:36] <dr4ken> taplar, just tested, exactly what ineedeed thank you :)
[16:32:44] <taplar> awesome
[16:37:46] <dr4ken> taplar, and the opposite? .unload() ?
[16:37:57] <taplar> empty()
[16:38:06] <taplar> or html('')
[17:05:22] <fr4zz>  with a draggable, how can i get the offset of the helper during drag?
[17:05:59] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#event-drag :)
[17:07:29] <fr4zz> ahh i didnt see helper in there before
[17:07:32] <fr4zz> thanks
[17:36:03] * taplar is ready for vaca day
[17:36:10] <robertmaxrees> where ya going?
[17:36:16] <taplar> home.  to bed.
[17:36:18] <taplar> lol
[17:36:23] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha smart
[17:36:44] <taplar> i'm trying to do better this year and use at least two vaca days a month
[17:37:15] <robertmaxrees> that's actually a great idea.
[17:37:20] <robertmaxrees> anything spur that?
[17:37:54] <taplar> it's been a pattern with me that i under use them, and then come febuary i'm having to burn them.
[17:38:26] <robertmaxrees> oof
[17:38:30] <taplar> so, probably better I use them and help with the potential work stress
[17:38:33] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:38:37] <robertmaxrees> prevent burning out
[18:04:31] <fr4zz> https://jsfiddle.net/uskgvwch/ << when the red box is dragged, i want to get the position of draggable projected onto the grey background container and the same for the helper during the drag
[18:04:35] <fr4zz> any idea how to do it?
[18:05:09] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried?
[18:05:57] <fr4zz> tried deducting parent offset and parrent of parent  (down to the container)
[18:06:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:06:23] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to get the position relative to the entire page?
[18:06:36] <fr4zz> no just to the grey area (.container)
[18:07:21] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/5861909/923919
[18:07:25] <fr4zz> they greay area will be a canvas and ill be drawing a bezier curve between the position of the draggable and the position of the helper
[18:08:12] <fr4zz> yeah, thats just for the draggable being directly in the target container
[18:08:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:08:38] <robertmaxrees> show me what you tried.
[18:08:44] <fr4zz> hold on
[18:08:45] <robertmaxrees> so i don't have to play incremental guessing games :)
[18:53:45] <fr4zz> robertparkerx, still around?
[18:54:28] <fr4zz> https://jsfiddle.net/uskgvwch/1/ << the test curve is just to show that drawing is working, i just cant get the correct positions of the draggable and helper
[18:55:35] <fr4zz> https://jsfiddle.net/uskgvwch/2/ << redraws the test curve too to confirm the drag is functioning
[18:59:10] <fr4zz> oh he left, or is robertparkerx the same guy?
[19:00:00] <taplar> different guy
[19:00:21] <fr4zz> doh
[19:00:52] <robertparkerx> different guy
[19:01:19] <fr4zz> dont suppose any of you know how to project the correct positions down onto the canvas?
[19:01:47] <taplar> unfortunately i'm not very experienced with canvas stuff
[19:02:05] <fr4zz> well doesnt have to do with canvas tbh
[19:02:28] <fr4zz> i just need to project the positions of the draggable and its helper down to the container
