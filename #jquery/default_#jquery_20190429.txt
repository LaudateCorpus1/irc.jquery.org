[06:00:18] <kernel-sanders> hi how i select a DOM element in the html with the Jqrewy!
[06:02:42] <undefined_bob> no offense but maybe some basics would be helpful for you. If you want you can take a look here https://learn.jquery.com/
[06:05:30] <kernel-sanders> none taken, the page you provided me with doesn't seem to mention selecting DOM elements
[06:06:45] <pavonia> "Using jQuery Core"
[06:06:54] <undefined_bob> it does, for example here: https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/faq/how-do-i-select-elements-when-i-already-have-a-dom-element/
[06:07:05] <undefined_bob> if that is what you're looking for :)
[06:07:16] <kernel-sanders> excellent
[06:07:58] <kernel-sanders> I'm thoroughly satisfied many thanks
[06:08:23] <undefined_bob> nice, you're welcome
[07:32:14] <CaBa> hi
[07:32:25] <kernel-sanders> hey
[07:33:10] <CaBa> i know it isn't exactly on-topic. but maybe someone can give me a hint anyway: is there any way to feed data into datatables in a column-wise fashion, without repeating the field (column) names for every record in json?
[07:35:25] <kernel-sanders> arrays? first array = column names a la csv
[07:37:51] <CaBa> kernel-sanders: yes, anything that is not as repetitive as a list of objects
[07:39:29] <kernel-sanders> CaBa, yes so as an example: [["name", "birthday"], ["CaBa", "01-01-1990"], ["kernel-sanders", "01-01-1990"]]
[07:39:53] <kernel-sanders> this immediately shows a weakness of JSON: no support for dates
[07:40:05] <CaBa> kernel-sanders: so this can be fed into datatables?
[07:43:10] <kernel-sanders> CaBa, https://datatables.net/examples/data_sources/ajax
[07:43:21] <kernel-sanders> CaBa, the Ajax data seems to be an array
[07:43:27] <kernel-sanders> no fieldnames are repeated
[07:44:11] <CaBa> kernel-sanders: thanks, ye, why was i convinced that i had seen this differently...
[12:37:23] <Crash1hd> Hey everyone I am getting. Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined here https://jsfiddle.net/r9xysbov/3/ Trying to figure out a way to get jQuery working inside the popup
[12:37:50] <robertmaxrees> your popup window's markup is invalid, for starters.
[12:38:09] <Crash1hd> ???
[12:38:24] <robertmaxrees> you can't define just a title and a closing head tag.
[12:39:08] <Crash1hd> Ahh ok https://jsfiddle.net/r9xysbov/4/ <-- fixed that part
[12:39:19] <robertmaxrees> still not a valid page.
[12:39:46] <robertmaxrees> you're confused about the head and body properties work.
[12:39:53] <robertmaxrees> but backing way up - why not just pop a modal?
[12:40:58] <Crash1hd> Well good question, this actually isn't even the real issue (this was a test to see if I could do it this way) but the real issue is something completely different lol
[12:41:08] <robertmaxrees> then what's the real issue?
[12:41:19] <Crash1hd> I am trying to figure out a way to inject html into a body tag of a page via just a script.js file
[12:41:20] <robertmaxrees> dynamically creating popup windows and trying to use them this way is strange.
[12:41:26] <Crash1hd> That includes jQuery
[12:41:28] <robertmaxrees> erm, why?
[12:41:44] <Crash1hd> Similar to what you see on sites like zendesk
[12:42:00] <robertmaxrees> just because zendesk does that doesn't make it a good idea ;)
[12:42:08] <Crash1hd> They give you a js file and you add it to your page and it injects a whole thing
[12:42:10] <Crash1hd> Fair :)
[12:42:33] <Crash1hd> I have one that works but currently it requires jQuery added to the main page as well and I was trying to figure out a way to reduce it to a single js file
[12:42:37] <robertmaxrees> also: it's not unreasonable for you to require that a site meet your dependencies for a widget
[12:43:15] <robertmaxrees> though if you're building widgets to be hosted on other people's sites, it's much safer to either not require jquery at all, or only do so if you can build out a contained module that won't pollute the client's global namespace.
[12:43:28] <Crash1hd> Fair just figured that if they can do it (there must be a way) now that being said I did notice that there widget uses frames and I was like hell no lol
[12:43:55] <robertmaxrees> just injecting jquery is going to stomp over the copy of jquery already there, which is a very bad idea.
[12:44:05] <Crash1hd> right
[12:44:07] <robertmaxrees> why why hell no to frames?  they're still perfectly legitimate for cases like this.
[12:44:34] <Crash1hd> I have always thought iframes where bad not sure why
[12:44:45] <robertmaxrees> they're overused but have legitimate cases.
[12:45:04] <Taplar> google recaptcha might want to know that iframes are a no no
[12:45:23] <Crash1hd> lol
[12:45:30] <Crash1hd> Fair enough
[12:45:33] <robertmaxrees> :)(
[12:45:35] <robertmaxrees> * :)
[12:46:06] <Crash1hd> So it might just be easier to have the javascript load the iframe and have all the work done inside the iframe
[12:46:42] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:48:57] <Crash1hd> Just out of curiosity though is it possible to inject Jquery into a popup window like I was trying to do?
[12:49:06] <robertmaxrees> it's possible but a bad idea.
[12:51:26] <Crash1hd> Fair :)
[12:51:36] <Crash1hd> So something more on the lines of var iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
[12:51:49] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[12:52:07] <robertmaxrees> just open an iframe to your server and go to town.
[12:52:21] <robertmaxrees> or do everything in (preferably compiled down) native js.
[12:57:00] <Crash1hd> :)
[13:01:11] <Crash1hd> robertmaxrees, is there a better way than iframe?
[13:01:21] <robertmaxrees> what, exactly, are you building?
[13:01:45] <Crash1hd> Its just a tab on the side of the page that says contact when you click on it it shows 4 buttons ways of contact
[13:01:52] <Crash1hd> In like a modal window sorta
[13:02:18] <robertmaxrees> is it for your own site?
[13:02:45] <Crash1hd> yes
[13:03:01] <robertmaxrees> erm, then why are you building it like it isn't?
[13:03:10] <Crash1hd> well its for a site for the company that I work for
[13:03:13] <robertmaxrees> just pop jquery in the head tag and build out the popover.
[13:03:18] <Crash1hd> And they want to place it on many sites
[13:03:22] <robertmaxrees> to a normal integration
[13:03:23] <robertmaxrees> *do
[13:03:25] <Crash1hd> Few of there sites
[13:03:47] <robertmaxrees> is jquery already available on these sites?
[13:03:49] <Crash1hd> So I figured if I had a single html page that contained everything and just injected it into the head of all the sites
[13:03:57] <Crash1hd> For the most part yes
[13:04:20] <Crash1hd> Just stick with the jQuery load that I already have working?
[13:04:30] <robertmaxrees> stick with the copy already on the pages.
[13:04:39] <robertmaxrees> don't load in a new version.
[13:05:24] <Crash1hd> Fair enough.
[13:06:43] <robertmaxrees> fwiw loading in 2 copies of jquery is a great way to mysteriously break things.
[13:06:53] <Crash1hd> Right
[15:40:08] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeeeeee
[15:41:34] <exvicesindaco> we
[16:39:28] <Taplar> already monday and robertmaxrees is ready for the weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekend
[16:40:57] <Chaos_Zero> Hey All, I am having an issue trying to make my <select multiple> options toggle on click instead of replacing current selection. I have this: https://jsfiddle.net/qf8wxugd/ , problem is if you scroll down the list and click one, it will toggle, but the list will snap back to the top always instead of staying in place. I am on chrome.
[16:42:04] <Taplar> that's weird
[16:42:30] <Taplar> actually, wait
[16:42:36] <Taplar> why are you cancelling the mouse down?
[16:43:17] <Chaos_Zero> so that it does not replace the current selected?
[16:43:29] <Taplar> you know multi select is a built it browser thing with holding Ctrl, right?
[16:43:58] <Chaos_Zero> I mean, yeah
[16:44:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:44:28] <Chaos_Zero> but...y'know, hopefully we can overwrite the 'built-in browser thing'
[16:44:38] <Chaos_Zero> =>
[16:44:46] <robertmaxrees> any reason you didn't just go with the checkbox idea i had in ##javascript?
[16:45:08] <Chaos_Zero> hey, one of you guys told me to come over here
[16:45:11] <Chaos_Zero> so no complaining
[16:45:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that was me.
[16:45:16] <robertmaxrees> just providing a suggestion :)
[16:45:18] <Taplar> usually when you start wanting to make select do something not native, most plugins make their own select like element
[16:45:22] <Taplar> there's a reason
[16:45:51] <Chaos_Zero> the problem is I care about performance too
[16:46:06] <Chaos_Zero> because its a very long list and only the native one has decent performance so far
[16:46:21] <Chaos_Zero> (I have tried checkbox-multiselect and select2 libraries)
[16:46:50] <robertmaxrees> didn't you say you had like 10k entries?
[16:46:55] <Taplar> ^^^^^^^
[16:46:57] <Chaos_Zero> yup
[16:46:58] <Taplar> lol
[16:47:00] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:47:09] <Taplar> yeah, no
[16:47:11] <robertmaxrees> perf is gonna kind of be a problem no matter what you do
[16:47:23] <Taplar> autocomplete/autosuggest would be more appropriate
[16:47:32] <Chaos_Zero> well, I will say that it is good / acceptable with native select, the only problem is having to hold CTRL
[16:47:50] <Taplar> you mean the expected behaviour is a problem?
[16:47:54] <Chaos_Zero> yes
[16:47:57] <Taplar> y?
[16:48:03] <Chaos_Zero> users, man
[16:48:05] <robertmaxrees> they want it to behave like checkboxes.
[16:48:10] <Taplar> they are trained to use multi select
[16:48:26] <robertmaxrees> ^ if you don't want a multiselect, don't use a multiselect :P
[16:50:58] <Chaos_Zero> it annoys me that there is a 92 upvoted SO answer that does not work, with no 25 upvotes comment saying what you guys are saying about that it should be impossible because it is a native element.
[16:51:10] <robertmaxrees> back up
[16:51:16] <robertmaxrees> nobody is saying it's impossible.
[16:51:35] <Chaos_Zero> ok, well, not acceptable / sustainable solution
[16:51:43] <robertmaxrees> we're just saying it's going to be incredibly difficult and that there's a much better solution available.
[16:51:44] <Chaos_Zero> the usual SO comments section warnings
[16:52:17] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[16:52:27] <robertmaxrees> just trying to help you avoid major headaches
[16:53:43] <Chaos_Zero> yeah I know
[16:54:04] <Chaos_Zero> I guess I should work on the styling 10,000 checkboxes to look like a multi select solution
[16:55:36] <Chaos_Zero> I just updated the fiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/qf8wxugd/1/) with a doubly hacky solution
[16:57:44] <Chaos_Zero> fix by pushing to the end of the call stack lol, this is so bad....
[16:57:51] <robertmaxrees> :sigh:
[16:57:53] <robertmaxrees> good luck
[16:58:27] <Chaos_Zero> thanks :) :/
[20:28:46] <voodoonofx> I'm using a jQuery 1.7+ plugin (https://bpaste.net/show/09ddab6df2e9) that defines some variables i'd like to access from outside the instantiated object. I'm not sure where to start. The $('#timeline') object doesn't seem to have Timespace, API or utility defined on it anywhere I can find.
[21:26:04] <shoky> voodoonofx: you can try .data('Timespace')
[22:10:10] <sydbarret> does a anchor has a real and a dispaly url?
[22:10:29] <sydbarret> i have a requirement that i dont understand about it
[22:10:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[22:11:16] <robertmaxrees> whatcha mean "a real and a display url"?
[22:13:49] <sydbarret> so  <a href=https://app.searchqueryauditor.com/dashboard/customer/ ">Customer details</a>"
[22:13:55] <sydbarret> like that for example
[22:14:15] <robertmaxrees> what part of that is the "real" and what part of that is the "display"??
[22:14:26] <robertmaxrees> also - i think you misplaced your quotes there.
[22:14:50] <sydbarret> so question is can you make appear a different url when you mouse over the link?
[22:14:55] <robertmaxrees> no.
[22:15:09] <sydbarret> ok
[22:15:16] <robertmaxrees> you could bind an event listener to take the user to a different location when they click the url, but that's kind of weird.
[22:15:22] <robertmaxrees> and something i wouldn't ever do.
[22:15:47] <robertmaxrees> since lying to your end users is a great way to lose their trust ;)
