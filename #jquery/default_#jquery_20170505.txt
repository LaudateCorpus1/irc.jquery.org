[00:25:29] <blitz206> Hey all - does anyone have experience animating SVG paths with jQuery?
[00:25:50] <blitz206> Or know if it can be done to begin with?
[01:49:06] <Cork> blitz206: it can, but you will have to parse the path field and do the math yourself
[01:49:37] <Cork> blitz206: there might be a plugin for jquery that extends the animate function so it can parse it
[01:50:12] <Cork> blitz206: but why not just animate using smil? it is quite capable and should be able to animate most things
[01:50:28] <blitz206> Not too familiar with smil
[01:50:39] <blitz206> My use case is rather messy
[01:50:46] <blitz206> React app with heavy animation
[01:51:15] <Cork> iiinteresting...
[01:51:22] <Cork> chrome has deprecated smil...
[01:51:24] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/SVG_animation_with_SMIL
[01:51:44] <blitz206> iiinteresting indeed
[01:51:52] <Cork> blitz206: smil is very similar to css animation
[01:51:56] <blitz206> Animations are getting trickier as we progress
[01:52:01] <Cork> it is what was used as base for it
[01:52:31] <Cork> https://github.com/weepy/jquery.path
[01:52:49] <Cork> but i would still recommend looking into using smil or css animation/transition
[01:53:09] <Cork> cause js animation is NOT hw accelerated and does easily get janky
[01:53:49] <Cork> while smil and css guarantees smoothness as long as it is at all possible by the browser (if the computer gets very overloaded nothing can ever be smooth)
[01:55:05] <blitz206> Okay - is Chrome in the process of deprecating or has it already been cut?
[01:55:17] <Cork> deprecating != cut
[01:55:42] <Cork> it just means they have marked it has either won't evolve or will in the future get removed
[01:55:57] <Cork> not sure if there deprecation in this case is a freeze or cut
[01:56:45] <Cork> i suspect they will wait for css animation path to land before they deprecate smil
[01:56:59] <Cork> cause before that there isn't a replacement for much of what smil can do
[01:59:04] <blitz206> Okay, let me look into it :)
[01:59:27] <blitz206> Project is due... tomorrow so would be quite a transition from my existing code base.
[01:59:32] <blitz206> But good for the future.
[02:01:07] <Cork> blitz206: the deprecation appears to have been canceled
[02:01:26] <Cork> the chromium bug is marked won't fix http://crbug.com/482689
[02:02:46] <Cork> blitz206: ah, right don't forget to be able to do js animation of svg the svg has to be inline in the html
[02:02:59] <Cork> you can't load it in <img> or <object> or <iframe>
[04:40:22] <sami> I'm having some issue finding the content of span.id in my button. https://gist.github.com/samimb/8cffb85f28bd19d9752e4f630292e9f1
[04:44:09] <sami> Nevermind
[06:24:29] <frezzo> Hi, when I click at the year, how to close it when click it again --> https://jsfiddle.net/nkw300ge/28/
[06:29:26] <Cork> frezzo: what is it that toggles the dropdown right now
[06:29:29] <Cork> *?
[06:30:03] <Cork> $(this).parent().sibling().addClass('active'); <-- btw this is broken and doesn't do anything, there are no .sibling() function
[06:30:58] <frezzo> Cork, that one is removed
[06:31:01] <Cork> frezzo: that said... why aren't you just using a normal select element?
[06:31:14] <frezzo> I need to design another way
[06:31:23] <Cork> in what way exactly?
[06:31:28] <frezzo> select is not simple to design for all browsers
[06:31:34] <Cork> you can style a select element to some degree
[06:31:43] <Cork> depends on how much you need to style it
[06:31:46] <frezzo> Cork yepp
[06:32:01] <Cork> also remember that what you are creating now will be hell to use on a touch device
[06:32:04] <frezzo> now it works --> https://jsfiddle.net/nkw300ge/29/
[06:32:26] <frezzo> but now I can open both
[06:32:36] <frezzo> the other should close when other is open
[06:32:40] <Cork> i can't even follow this code to be honest...
[06:33:14] <frezzo> haha :D
[06:33:17] <Cork> what is line 63 doing for example??
[06:33:58] <frezzo> that is so dropdown open and close
[06:34:00] <Cork> (and no that wasn't a compliment...)
[06:34:25] <Cork> would prob have made the ul a child of the div then
[06:34:42] <Cork> made the div position relative and the up position absolute
[06:35:08] <Cork> then you could just set active on the div and css inheritance can solve the rest
[06:35:39] <Cork> anyway gtg
[09:54:36] <thijs> Hi there
[09:54:57] <thijs> Could somebody help me please?
[09:55:17] <Cork> not before you ask the question (on irc always ask the question, not for someone)
[09:55:35] <thijs> I'm trying to make a register/login screen, but it only works as a multipage document
[09:56:21] <thijs> I wan't it to be multiple documents, not one. here is what I have for now: http://henk418.tk
[09:57:17] <thijs> this example is not the multiple page document but the multiple documents (a bit confusing)
[09:58:00] <thijs> I have a javascript that will direct to a page, but this only works when I use it as a multipage and reference to a id of a page: #page
[09:58:17] <thijs> when I direct it to a page.html it doesn't work like in the example on henk.tk
[09:58:23] <thijs> http://henk418.tk
[09:58:29] <Cork> what exactly do you mean by "multipage"?
[09:58:42] <thijs> multiple pages in 1 html document
[09:59:13] <Cork> ah, you mean frames
[09:59:26] <Cork> why exactly would it only work in frames?
[09:59:39] <Cork> and how is this at all related to jqeury?
[10:00:07] <thijs> eum, frames? that's the first time i hear that. the demo/docs say it are pages
[10:00:47] <Cork> frame is an html tag that lets you set up regions and load multiple html pages into each frame
[10:01:02] <Cork> if you check view-source:http//henk418.tk/
[10:01:11] <Uhkis> frames? did i just travel back in time?
[10:01:15] <Cork> you will see it from line 21 to 23
[10:01:20] <Cork> Uhkis: ya
[10:01:43] <thijs> well I thought the multipage is a jquery thing right? and it works as a multipage. But when I change to an external page like page.html it does not work. I have to say that this is going to be an app, build with phonegap for android.
[10:01:55] <Cork> no
[10:02:01] <Cork> there is no script here at all
[10:02:05] <Cork> just pure html
[10:02:21] <Cork> if you don't want the frames you can go directly to http://85.150.84.31/
[10:02:33] <Cork> it will be the page without the frames
[10:04:44] <thijs> I'm confused... I don't wan't the frames/pages
[10:05:03] <thijs> I just want to direct to a other document called page2.html
[10:05:45] <thijs> it was working when I used frames/pages like #page1 and #page2, but when I use page2.html and page3.html nothing happens
[10:05:52] <Cork> thijs: then just change the A record for henk418.tk to point to 85.150.84.31
[10:06:28] <thijs> ok, what do you exactly mean with change the A record?
[10:06:33] <Cork> ...
[10:06:54] <thijs> When it is an app, I don't have the IP adress / URL right?
[10:06:57] <Cork> thijs: when you go to a site (ex. henk418.tk) the name (henk418.tk) is asked to a dns server
[10:07:27] <Cork> and the ip 195.20.42.220 is returned
[10:07:29] <thijs> It is not going to be a site. It will be an android app. build with html/css/javascript
[10:07:32] <Cork> it is the current server for the site
[10:08:01] <Cork> THAT server currently just servs a small static html page with a frame tag loading a page from http://85.150.84.31/
[10:08:12] <Cork> so there are no content on the first server at all
[10:08:21] <Cork> and js can't solve this
[10:08:37] <Cork> so again, this has NOTHING to do with jquery or javascript
[10:08:53] <Cork> it is server config and server files
[10:08:57] <Cork> (and dns)
[10:12:44] <thijs> I'm more confused now..
[10:12:53] <Cork> ok, by what?
[10:13:34] <thijs> well, I don't think it has something to do with a server or dns or something. like I sayd: this is going to be an app for android.
[10:14:05] <thijs> So there is no server or dns. It is just the javascript that is not working right
[10:14:06] <Cork> thijs: ok, so your going to load the url in a embedded webbrowser
[10:14:12] <Cork> that won't change what the server sends
[10:14:14] <MikeD_> thijs: what are you trying to do?  i scrolled back, but i couldn't tell
[10:14:39] <Cork> MikeD_: he wants js to remove a frameset and load the frame as the full site
[10:14:53] <Cork> and i'm trying to tell him it isn't possible
[10:15:08] <Cork> (as the two sites isn't the same server or anything)
[10:15:10] <thijs> this is the first time i hear somebody talk about frames, so I don't think we should talk about frames
[10:15:18] <Cork> ...
[10:15:36] <Cork> thijs: ok, we can stop talking about frames if the site stops using them...
[10:15:38] <MikeD_> yeah, sounds like thijs should restate the problem
[10:15:45] <thijs> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.0/pages/
[10:15:57] <Cork> thijs: i suggest you take this question to #web
[10:16:02] <thijs> this is the "page"/"pages" I'm talking about
[10:16:05] <Cork> or #html
[10:16:46] <thijs> I have created a multipage with a javascript so the user could register and login. This all works when I use a multipage.
[10:16:56] <Cork> thijs: well this is what http://85.150.84.31/
[10:17:03] <Cork> servs
[10:17:16] <Cork> so the pages looks like it talks about the server 85.150.84.31
[10:17:28] <Cork> your loading another site that isn't that site though
[10:17:44] <thijs> but, when I change to 3 pages (not 3 in 1 document but 3 documents) the javascript doesn't redirect to a page (was #page is now page.html)
[10:18:09] <MikeD_> "The id attribute of all your elements must be not only  unique on a given page, but also unique across the pages in a site."  <-- that's ... weird
[10:19:02] <Cork> MikeD_: it is cause jquery mobile loads different pages into the same page
[10:19:13] <thijs> I'm not using the id's for the 3 documents, only in the multipages wich is working. the 3 documents are not working
[10:20:42] <thijs> only thing I have changed from multipage document to 3 single documents are:
[10:21:31] <thijs>  the javascript redirection:       window.location.href = "#page1"; (this is the multipage example that works) and I have changed it to         window.location.href = "index.html"; (this does not work)
[10:21:51] <thijs> do I need a javascript code to tell it is a external page?
[10:22:35] <MikeD_> take off the .href part
[10:23:46] <MikeD_> nm, i guess i've just never used it like that
[10:24:05] <salientknight> Hey all... I'm having a problem where my Jquery doesn't seem to fire on reload in IE and Edge does anyone have any insight into that?
[10:24:51] <Cork> salientknight: fire, you mean for .ready or unload or beforeunload?
[10:24:57] <Cork> or something else?
[10:25:35] <salientknight> I mean it works on the first load, and then on page refresh its not activated
[10:25:50] <thijs> mikeD_, only this code works on android. all other codes I have tried did not work on android, only with browsers but I'll give it a try
[10:26:20] <Cork> salientknight: aaand by activated you mean?
[10:26:30] <Cork> handlers aren't bound or what?
[10:26:47] <salientknight> So for example, responsiveslides.js works when the page loads but on refresh it doesn't ... the same goes for the scripts I am using to move things into place... everything works in everything I've tested except Edge and IE 11
[10:27:33] <Cork> salientknight: sounds like a cache problem
[10:27:51] <Cork> hard to suggest what it might be without seeing it
[10:28:49] <salientknight> There is a work around for IE with responsiveslides that you make all of the LI's display none -- responsive slides unhides then when it runs... they work on page load, but on refresh they are not unhiding ... when I fiddle with code, and remove the display:none, the content is there, but I see that the controls have not been rendered and the slides have not been positioned
[10:29:21] <Cork> salientknight: i would recommend starting to identify if the js actually runs
[10:29:30] <Cork> and start your way up through the stack from there
[10:29:33] <salientknight> Cork, you think that because the page is cashed it's not running the scripts again when the page is refreshed, its just serving it from cache?
[10:29:48] <Cork> currently your debugging it from a very high point and you can't identify what is actually going on
[10:30:13] <Cork> salientknight: no i don't, you don't have enough info for anyone to answer that yet
[10:30:39] <Cork> so: 1. do you get console errors when the page reloads (meaning js errors out)
[10:30:49] <Cork> 2. is the content of the js files executed
[10:31:05] <salientknight> I put a console.log("test") is the code that repositions the slides and it's being hit, just not doing anything
[10:31:12] <salientknight> There are not console errors
[10:31:20] <Cork> 3. does the element the js depends on exist when the related code runs
[10:31:33] <Cork> salientknight: ok, so not cache then
[10:31:45] <Cork> you have something expecting something to happen in a specific order
[10:31:58] <Cork> and that order changes cause the reload goes too fast or something (again only guessing)
[10:32:13] <Cork> you have to dive into the specific code and find where it starts going wrong
[10:32:41] <Cork> if console.log works it is dependent on the code in the file, not the browser doing something wrong
[10:32:45] <salientknight> I am using the size of the images to resize the container.... And the images are starting as display:none responsiveslides.js unhides them when it runs, but that is not happening
[10:33:11] <Cork> salientknight: have you verified that this is the case or just "what i wrote the code to do"?
[10:33:20] <Cork> don't assume
[10:33:22] <Cork> verify
[10:34:12] <Cork> verify every step of the code execution on reload until the verification fails and you will have found the problem
[10:34:12] <salientknight> I didn't write the responsiveslides.js and I have verified that it unhides the active slide ...
[10:34:13] <thijs> removing the href did not work
[10:34:22] <Cork> THEN we can help you understand why it fails
[10:34:24] <salientknight> Ok I'mm work on that thanks
[10:34:37] <Cork> salientknight: well your using it, so you will have to debug it if you want the site to work
[10:34:54] <Cork> (and is why you should never use scripts you can't understand in your site)
[10:34:57] <salientknight> I am working on the assumption that it's an IE/edge load order issues
[10:35:11] <Cork> your just shifting the blame...
[10:35:37] <salientknight> and that parts of the code are executing before the images are loading
[10:35:43] <Cork> start by verifying that all the things you control (including third party libs you choose to use) works
[10:35:53] <Cork> then we can start looking at the browser for bugs
[10:36:06] <salientknight> ok I'll see what I can come up with thanks
[10:36:11] <Cork> just note that almost all the times it is cause the code does somethign wrong
[10:36:29] <Cork> for example it expects an event to fire in a specific order
[10:36:30] <salientknight> Even when it only breaks in 2 browsers?
[10:36:41] <Cork> there are only 3 browsers -_-'
[10:36:52] <Cork> webkit/blink, gecko and trident
[10:37:03] <Cork> so your failing in 60%
[10:37:12] <salientknight> Opera, Chrome, Safari and FF all work ... IE 11 and Edge do not ...
[10:37:37] <salientknight> Ok I hear ya
[10:37:43] <Cork> salientknight: so you assume the engine works bug identically to how gecko and webkit does it
[10:37:49] <Cork> doesn't mean the code is right
[10:38:08] <Cork> (doesn't exactly mean the code is wrong, but that is what you have to verify)
[10:38:52] <Cork> and normally it is MUCH faster and simpler to find the assumption in your code and add the two cases or similar
[10:39:28] <Cork> then to file a bug with microsoft and wait a~ 15 years for all older versions of the browser to get out of fashion
[10:45:06] <jomofcw> Can you confirm me this, please : "$radio.attr('checked',true) doesnt trigger the change event of the radio". Right ?
[10:45:27] <Cork> jomofcw: never EVER use attr('checked' anything
[10:45:34] <Cork> that is not cross browser
[10:45:38] <jomofcw> Oh gosh !
[10:45:39] <Cork> also yes it won't trigger events
[10:45:43] <jomofcw> prop instead ?
[10:45:45] <Cork> yes
[10:45:53] <thijs> ok I found that I should use path instead of href, but then it is not working either..
[10:45:56] <jomofcw> Cork OK, thanks.
[10:45:58] <Cork> and you want .prop(
[10:45:59] <Cork> opps
[10:46:20] <Cork> and you want .prop('checked', true).trigger('change')
[10:46:27] <jomofcw> OK Cork, thanks ^^ !
[10:46:30] <Cork> if you want the event handler to process the new state
[10:55:35] <thijs> What code is needed to direct to a external document? (page2.html)
[10:56:02] <thijs> I can only get it work with the use of multipages. not with external documents/pages
[10:56:44] <lost123> hi is there any reason why jQuery.ajax will work but jQuery.post won't?
[10:56:53] <Cork> O_o
[10:57:03] <Cork> lost123: any other differences?
[10:57:10] <Cork> cause .post is just a short hand for .ajax
[10:58:02] <Cork> lost123: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L833
[11:00:24] <lost123> Cork:  how can i check the errors thrown by .post?
[11:00:47] <Cork> just like you would for $.ajax
[11:00:55] <Cork> $.post().fail(function() {})
[11:01:16] <Cork> $.ajax(url, { type: 'post' }).fail(function() {})
[11:01:17] <lost123> Cork:  i will show you the code in a while, been 2 days i am stuck with this, feel like pulling my hair
[11:03:08] <lost123> Cork:  https://pastebin.com/fJC1e7Yj how can i put in some error checking in this
[11:03:56] <lost123> i am getting an empty response when i see the console.
[11:04:32] <Cork> lost123: https://jsfiddle.net/q735u87o/
[11:06:04] <Cork> ah, the php code in there makes jsfiddles tidy confused
[11:06:15] <Cork> i hope it gives you an idea though
[11:06:34] <Cork> lost123: i would recommend reading the generated javascript instead of the one with server scripts in it
[11:06:44] <Cork> cause then you don't know what exactly your debugging
[11:06:50] <Cork> anyway end of day so gtg
[11:07:07] <lost123> Cork:  thanks can you explain reading generated js?
[11:07:18] <lost123> Cork:  i am trying the .fail you added.
[11:08:02] <Cork> lost123: read the js you send to the browser
[11:08:06] <Cork> or inspect it in the browser
[11:08:15] <Cork> don't read the .php file on the server it won't help you
[11:08:43] <Cork> (i would prob also recommend not mixing server and client side scripts, but that is a little late for this project)
[11:16:24] <lost123> Cork: got it , thanks a lot man i am trying
[11:28:09] <DexDeadly>  Hello.  I'm having trouble with a radio button on my web page.  What I'm trying to do is when clicking the radio button, based of the value of the radio button it will take the value of the hidden field and will run some calculations.  Just for testing I placed the radio button in my modal and when I click on the radio button it does not work.  I tried to create a jsfiddle to demonstrate but
[11:28:09] <DexDeadly> it seems to work.  however the jsfiddle isn't doing anything with a modal.  Is there something different about a modal to consider?
[11:41:18] <taplar_> depends on how you are doing your bindings and when you are creating those radio buttons
[11:44:34] <DexDeadly> well I figured it out
[11:44:47] <DexDeadly> I was using icheck to style the radio button and doing that it just wasn't working
[11:44:57] <DexDeadly> considering I dont really need it styled I think I'm just going to let it be
[12:02:01] <DexDeadly> actually so I have a questin though
[12:02:17] <DexDeadly> and I think I just answered it
[12:04:48] <DexDeadly> ok maybe not.  So with this I'm trying to choose between the 2.  I realized at first I was attaching the click on the id of the radio button since the radio button both shares the id.
[12:05:13] <taplar_> you can't repeat ids
[12:05:30] <DexDeadly> So I made it a class so that it attaches to both radio buttons.
[12:05:42] <taplar_> yup
[12:05:47] <DexDeadly> However its not pulling the value of the 2nd radio button only the first.  I'm outputting it to console
[12:06:13] <taplar_> $('.someclass').val() ?
[12:06:33] <DexDeadly> you know what nope
[12:06:40] <DexDeadly> i was doing getElementById
[12:07:30] <taplar_> console.log($('.someclass').map(function(){return this.value;}));
[12:11:02] <DexDeadly> https://jsfiddle.net/q899vrdn/
[12:12:19] <DexDeadly> i'm trying to choose to charge a fee thats either flat or percentage as you can see
[12:12:32] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/q899vrdn/1/
[12:13:22] <taplar_> for line 5 you really just want this.vlaue
[12:13:25] <taplar_> this.value
[12:13:49] <taplar_> 'this' will be the radio button that was clicked.  no reason to try to look it up
[12:13:54] <DexDeadly> sorry I didn't copy the whole thing
[12:14:13] <DexDeadly> I see you added the });
[12:15:16] <DexDeadly> ahhh so changing it to this works
[12:15:23] <DexDeadly> excellent thanks!
[12:19:48] <frezzo> how to use this but replace 2016 with a variable ? -->   $("li:contains('2016')").click();
[12:20:18] <taplar_> '"+ variable +"'
[12:21:27] <frezzo> taplar_ thx.. found it just at google too =)
[12:44:50] <willjfield> hey so I'm following the first example for $.when() to make two different ajax requests but they're both returning the same response – https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[12:45:15] <willjfield> they're definitely pointing to two different urls, in this case two different images
[12:45:23] <willjfield> but both responses are the same image
[12:49:22] <frezzo> if someone knows a better way of doing all this "if questions", please tell --> https://jsfiddle.net/tkdsdjvp/
[12:50:58] <salientknight> Cork, so my load order flips on refresh in IE and Edge. Fist load getScript loads first and on refresh it loads last .... Thoughts on how to tackle that?
[12:53:30] <taplar_> frezzo: make a map
[12:54:01] <frezzo> taplar_ do you have an example of how to do map?
[12:55:04] <taplar_> var monthNameByNumeric = { '01': 'January', '02': 'Febuary', ... };  vay monthName = monthNameByNumeric[someNumber];
[12:55:20] <taplar_> vay = var
[12:56:25] <salientknight> Nm not the problem back to the drawing board
[12:57:09] <taplar_> willjfield: got a fiddle with what you are attempting?
[12:57:30] <willjfield> one sec...
[12:59:14] <frezzo> taplar_ oh thx
[12:59:15] <frezzo> =)
[13:01:55] <willjfield> sorry, not much experience with jsfiddle so I'm not sure how to actually link to the assets but here's my code
[13:01:56] <willjfield> https://jsfiddle.net/j9mhhnwg/
[13:03:08] <taplar_> ok, so what is the issue?
[13:03:57] <willjfield> so page0resp and page1resp are both giving me page1.jpg from the first ajax request
[13:04:18] <willjfield> so if  you see line 15 and 16, they're both adding the same image into the pdf
[13:05:06] <taplar_> you verified in the network console that it is making the request to both image urls, and that they are in fact different images?
[13:05:17] <taplar_> because syntactically i don't see an issue here
[13:05:44] <willjfield> hm
[13:05:58] <willjfield> they are definitely different images
[13:06:38] <willjfield> let me see if I can figure anything out digging through the network console
[13:07:40] <willjfield> wtf, so in network console it is loading both images...
[13:07:43] <willjfield> interesting...
[13:07:56] <willjfield> well at least now I know the issue isn't with the ajax request
[13:08:04] <taplar_> so i question what your doing with the doc.image stuff
[13:08:23] <willjfield> I'm generating a pdf
[13:08:37] <willjfield> so what it should do is request these images and append them to the pdf and then save it out
[13:08:45] <willjfield> let me dig through the pdfkit documentation
[13:08:49] <willjfield> maybe I can figure something out
[13:09:39] <willjfield> this is the library I'm using http://pdfkit.org/docs/images.html
[13:15:20] <willjfield> so strange, thanks for at least helping work through it!

[13:32:20] * salientknight jumps and shouts got it working 
[14:21:44] <Ahiiru> hi
[14:21:48] <Ahiiru> I need help with this code
[14:21:51] <Ahiiru> https://jsfiddle.net/b58ahj7t/
[14:21:54] <Ahiiru> it has an explanation inside my link
[14:22:44] <robertmaxrees> abstract to a function and then run that on pageload.
[14:25:33] <Ahiiru> ok, I'll try
[14:26:14] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/b58ahj7t/2/
[14:26:15] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[14:26:17] <robertmaxrees> super simple.
[14:26:58] <Ahiiru> thanks :)
[14:27:03] <Ahiiru> rally helped me
[14:27:06] <Ahiiru> really*
[14:31:20] <_bs> is there a way to detect the closing/destroying of an iframe?
[15:02:24] <fooman2011> Hello. Could you please tell me why $("#object").val()  and $("#object").val(undefined)    doesn't return the same value ?
[15:04:38] <Demannu> What would the proper event listener be for mobile browsers? I'm attempting to trigger a JS function after a form value has changed.
[15:04:50] <Demannu> Using onChange in the input field works for desktops, but not mobile browsers
[15:05:30] <taplar_> fooman2011: val(thing) is the setter.  without the 'thing' it is the getter
[15:06:03] <taplar_> also val(thing) as a setter will, iirc, return the element it was called upon in order to allow chaining
[15:06:51] <taplar_> Demannu: change events should fire on mobile devices as well
[15:07:38] <Demannu> taplar_: Then I'm doing something wrong. Let me pull the code and gist it for you
[15:07:40] <Ahiiru> robertmaxrees: hi, I made a third <select> here: https://jsfiddle.net/b58ahj7t/3/
[15:08:15] <Ahiiru> what I need now is when the first <select> changes the value, the third <select> must hide
[15:09:00] <taplar_> Ahiiru: you are repeating ids in that fiddle.  that's invalid markup
[15:09:11] <taplar_> aww, fk, nvm, the other one is a for
[15:09:37] <Ahiiru> taplar_: can you tell me the line(s)?
[15:09:50] <taplar_> no, i miss-read it
[15:09:55] <Ahiiru> oh
[15:11:13] <taplar_> it seems to work as far as i can tell
[15:11:20] <Ahiiru> yes, it's ok
[15:11:50] <Demannu> taplar_: https://gist.github.com/Demannu/05a311712364daca85e5c3ef6441cf95
[15:11:56] <Ahiiru> but I'd need that, if the first <select> changes to any other value, the third <select> must hide
[15:12:09] <Demannu> The onChange in the input field works fine on the desktop, but never triggers the JS from the mobile browser
[15:12:09] <taplar_> 'any other value' ?
[15:12:38] <Ahiiru> taplar_: yes, precisely
[15:12:50] <taplar_> other than what?
[15:13:32] <Ahiiru> per example, the second and third <select> hides if I select the <option> with the text Select, right?
[15:13:41] <taplar_> yep
[15:14:01] <taplar_> if you select the top value
[15:14:35] <Ahiiru> now I need that, if the first <select> changes to any other <option> (Select, option 1, option 2, option 3), it must hide the third <select>
[15:14:58] <taplar_> which would be the else case to your if
[15:15:11] <Ahiiru> let me think about it
[15:15:13] <Ahiiru> hmm
[15:15:19] <taplar_> value === "" is your first option
[15:15:28] <taplar_> "any other value" would be not === ""
[15:15:33] <taplar_> which is your current else
[15:17:36] <taplar_> Demannu: 'never triggers the js from the mobile browser' ?
[15:18:00] <taplar_> oh
[15:18:03] <Demannu> taplar_: Yes, the function I'm asking it to execute on input change isn't being triggered.
[15:18:29] <taplar_> so without the top logic, if you are doing inline bindings, it works on a desktop but not a mobile device
[15:18:36] <Demannu> Yes
[15:19:04] <Demannu> I have also tried onblur and onkeyup
[15:19:07] <Demannu> and neither work on mobile
[15:19:27] <taplar_> are you using any plugins or anything to transform input fields on mobile devices?
[15:19:40] <Demannu> I'm using bootstrap as a CSS framework
[15:19:56] <Demannu> But other than that, I don't believe so. I have jquery loaded
[15:23:21] <taplar_> i just made this and tried it in my phone.  works fine https://jsfiddle.net/6u2k0wb9/2/
[15:23:23] <Ahiiru> taplar_: I'm not very good in jquery, do you know the correct syntax for the line 8? https://jsfiddle.net/b58ahj7t/4/
[15:23:58] <taplar_> why are you trying to do an else if?
[15:24:10] <taplar_> you already know at that point it is not ""
[15:24:16] <Ahiiru> that came to my mind, is it wrong?
[15:24:21] <taplar_> yes
[15:24:23] <Ahiiru> hm
[15:24:30] <taplar_> work the logic
[15:24:42] <taplar_> if (the value is "") you do something
[15:24:50] <taplar_> an else would be if that is false
[15:24:55] <taplar_> which would be the value is not ""
[15:25:12] <taplar_> which is what you said is the case that you should hide the third select
[15:25:48] <taplar_> right?
[15:25:56] <Ahiiru> I'm thinking
[15:27:02] <Ahiiru> you are right: https://jsfiddle.net/b58ahj7t/5/
[15:27:10] <Ahiiru> this was much simpler
[15:27:51] <taplar_> cooleo
[15:28:21] <Ahiiru> thanks :)
[15:28:26] <taplar_> np
[15:28:31] <Demannu> taplar_: Must be something with bootstrap then
[15:29:30] <taplar_> if something with bootstrap is transforming that element so that it is no longer a basic input, and what the user is interacting with on mobile is not that original input, it may be that the translation from input to whatever is losing the onChange binding
[15:29:45] <taplar_> which, in any case, you should consider binding logically instead of inline anyway
[15:36:55] <Demannu> taplar_: Ok, I made a bind however it's not triggering at all :3
[15:36:56] <Demannu> $('input[id="customerLookup"]').on('change', function(){
[15:36:56] <Demannu>             console.log(this.value);
[15:36:56] <Demannu>         })
[15:37:25] <taplar_> console.log($('#customerLookup').length);
[15:37:38] <taplar_> don't use attribute lookups for ids
[15:38:16] <taplar_> your browser is geared towards id and class lookups being super fast.  attribute lookups are not
[15:38:51] <Demannu> Fair enough, so it returned 0 when I put it outside the listner
[15:38:57] <Demannu> But the listener is still not firing
[15:39:07] <Demannu> $('#customerLookup').on('change', function(){
[15:39:07] <Demannu>             console.log($('#customerLookup').length);
[15:39:07] <Demannu>         })
[15:39:09] <Demannu> Current bind
[15:39:10] <taplar_> so if you put that right before that binding it prints 0?
[15:39:14] <Demannu> Yes
[15:39:22] <taplar_> then the element does not exist in the dom yet
[15:39:28] <taplar_> or you have the selector wrong
[15:39:33] <Demannu> input.form-control(type="text", id="customerLookup", name="customerEntry", placeholder="Customer Name",aria-describedby="basic-addon1")
[15:39:36] <Demannu> That's the element
[15:39:41] <taplar_> which is not html
[15:39:47] <Demannu> It's pug engine
[15:39:53] <Demannu> Lemme grab the HTML
[15:40:02] <taplar_> ok, then i assume the pug engine is generating the html?
[15:40:14] <Demannu> <input class="form-control" type="text" id="customerLookup" name="customerEntry" placeholder="Customer Name" aria-describedby="basic-addon1">
[15:40:20] <Demannu> That's the generated HTML
[15:40:33] <taplar_> two things.  where is the binding in relation to the page, and when is the markup generated?
[15:40:44] <Demannu> The binding is in the top of the body
[15:40:52] <Demannu> The markup is generated just below the binding
[15:40:58] <Demannu> Should I put all my bindings at the bottom of the page?
[15:41:08] <taplar_> is it generated by the browser, or before being sent to the client?
[15:41:14] <Demannu> Before being sent to client
[15:41:21] <Demannu> The client receives a normal HTML
[15:41:23] <taplar_> ok, is the binding in a document ready?
[15:41:28] <Demannu> It is not.
[15:41:32] <Demannu> and I realized that may be my issue
[15:41:39] <taplar_> ok, so either put it in a document ready or put it at the bottom of the body
[15:43:40] <Demannu> Ok! So, progress.
[15:43:45] <Demannu> The binding now works on desktop
[15:44:06] <Demannu> Still not mobile
[15:45:04] <Demannu> I can verify because I'm watching the debug output and desktop hits the API, but the mobile doesn't hit the API
[15:45:17] <taplar_> ok, so at this point i feel like i should point you towards ##bootstrap.  they may be more easily able to tell you something you may be running into with their library
[15:45:29] <Demannu> Fair enough, I appreciate all your help to this point
[15:45:33] <taplar_> sure man
[15:48:30] <Demannu> Huzzah, so it is running the trigger
[15:48:36] <Demannu> Just not running the AJAX
[15:48:49] <Demannu> I just threw an alert in and it popped up mobile
[15:49:28] <Kalinox> Hello, anyone here?
[15:49:35] <taplar_> few peeps
[15:50:28] <Kalinox> I've copied/pasted this JQuery, mind you, I've actually made a few work before. Some I haven't managed to figure out how they work. This one wont work because its saying the following errors
[15:50:30] <Kalinox> Uncaught TypeError: foo.poptrox is not a function     at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (Accueil.html?_c9_id=livepreview0&_c9_host=https://ide.c9.io:62)     at j (jquery-1.11.1.min.js:2)     at Object.fireWith [as resolveWith] (jquery-1.11.1.min.js:2)     at Function.ready (jquery-1.11.1.min.js:2)     at HTMLDocument.J (jquery-1.11.1.min.js:2)
[15:50:54] <Kalinox> Am I missing anything? I can give you the website on which I downloaded it..
[15:50:59] <taplar_> got a fiddle showing what you're doing?
[15:51:00] <Demannu> taplar_: I got it. Turns out I'm a useless towel.
[15:51:06] <Kalinox> I pasted the Links/Script at the top of the html file.
[15:51:08] <taplar_> Demannu: D:
[15:51:43] <Kalinox> And html where it needed to be... =/
[15:52:29] <Demannu> I had my ajax pointing localhost still and completely fucking missed that
[15:53:19] <Kalinox> Perhaps if I paid someone for help, someone would be interested?
[15:53:28] <taplar_> did you see my question?
[15:53:34] <Kalinox> Oh.
[15:53:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:53:56] <robertmaxrees> Kalinox fwiw no money should be exchanged here ;)
[15:54:01] <Kalinox> Mind if I show my website to you?
[15:54:14] <taplar_> fiddles are preferred
[15:54:19] <Kalinox> Alright robert.
[15:54:22] <taplar_> make a small case of what you are trying
[15:54:27] <Kalinox> Alright, I guess I'll start making a fiddle of some sort.
[15:54:48] <Kalinox> (Its for a school project, already late behind)
[15:55:10] <taplar_> all the more reason to learn about it instead of relying on copy and paste, ;)
[15:56:23] <Kalinox> How am I suppose to make a fiddle if theres more than one html file?
[15:56:40] <taplar_> you are trying to use some sort of plugin i assume?
[15:56:45] <taplar_> poptrox or whatever
[15:56:48] <Kalinox> Yeh.. o.o
[15:56:52] <Kalinox> Exactly a poptrox.
[15:56:59] <taplar_> so poptrox works on some kind of html element(s)
[15:57:03] <taplar_> make one of those elements
[15:57:28] <Kalinox> I'm not sure I quite understand.
[15:57:31] <Kalinox> =/
[15:57:50] <taplar_> what is poptrox supossed to do?
[15:57:52] <Kalinox> Perhaps I could upload the file somewhere so you can see the demo via download?
[15:59:32] <Kalinox> Well, basicly I just want to make it so that when I click an element it opens a lightbox with html content inside of it.
[15:59:49] <taplar_> ok, so 'an element'.  what is that?
[15:59:55] <Kalinox> <> </>
[16:00:00] <taplar_> what kind?
[16:00:05] <taplar_> there are tons of html tags man
[16:00:32] <Kalinox> <a href  etc..
[16:00:43] <Kalinox> via when you click the link.. o.O?
[16:00:46] <taplar_> ok, so there's your element
[16:00:58] <taplar_> make a fiddle, create an <a> and try to initialize that plugin on that element
[16:00:59] <Kalinox> Thank you for your patience taplar.
[16:01:59] <Kalinox> But how do I link the jquery <link> to the fiddle though?
[16:02:16] <Kalinox> It says it dosen't require <head> elements.
[16:02:24] <taplar_> see the box in the bottom right that has Javascipt in the top right corner
[16:02:26] <taplar_> ?
[16:02:46] <taplar_> click that guy and there are options to include jsfiddle hosted versions of jquery
[16:03:03] <taplar_> for the plugin file, there is an option on the left hand side for "external resources"
[16:03:45] <Kalinox> Alright give me a few.
[16:05:41] <Kalinox> https://jsfiddle.net/583g91ct/1/
[16:05:46] <Kalinox> Did I do it right?
[16:06:22] <taplar_> the html box is just for the body, no html or head stuff
[16:06:32] <taplar_> all your js should go in the bottom left box
[16:07:44] <Kalinox> What about now? https://jsfiddle.net/583g91ct/3/
[16:08:02] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/wNuBDAP.png
[16:08:03] <robertmaxrees> Kalinox
[16:08:09] <robertmaxrees> it should look like this.
[16:08:46] <robertmaxrees> jquery selected via the "frameworks & extensions" dropdown, not pasted into that input.  and you link to poptrox via thje left-hand side "external resources" box.
[16:10:38] <Kalinox> How do I know which JQuery version to use if this is the <script> link ? jquery-1.11.1.min.js
[16:10:57] <Kalinox> There is no 1.11.1 inside the framework/extensions
[16:11:12] <robertmaxrees> 2.2.4 will be close enough.
[16:11:56] <Kalinox> Alright, https://jsfiddle.net/583g91ct/7/ what else is missing o.o?
[16:12:14] <robertmaxrees> i sent you exactly what you need.
[16:12:28] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/wNuBDAP.png
[16:12:32] <robertmaxrees> as well as a fiddle ;)
[16:13:55] <Kalinox> So how do I link the images if they're on my computer?
[16:14:07] <robertmaxrees> link to different images that exist on the internet :)
[16:15:52] <Kalinox> So I have to upload every images and add the links to the html..?
[16:16:02] <robertmaxrees> or just use ones that already exist on the web.
[16:16:11] <Kalinox> And what about if I need a 2nd html file?
[16:16:12] <robertmaxrees> nobody said they had to be the exact images for a test case.
[16:16:30] <robertmaxrees> the goal here is to make an isolated test case, not recreate your entire page.
[16:16:34] <Kalinox> Well, I guess the url images aren't very important considering we're just making a lightbox on it.
[16:17:00] <taplar_> yep, we just want to get it to work.  if you get there, then you have a base of what you can apply to your actual page(s)
[16:17:24] <Kalinox> Aye... So... Now for that 2nd html page I was speaking of.. o_O
[16:17:37] <robertmaxrees> what does the 2nd page have to do with anything?
[16:18:00] <Kalinox> Well, when clicking on <a> it opens a lightbox with .html file content inside of it.
[16:18:31] <robertmaxrees> are you doing an ajax call?
[16:18:31] <Kalinox> file:///C:/Users/User/Desktop/Highly-Configurable-Responsive-Content-Lightbox-Plugin-For-jQuery-poptrox/demo/demo1.html
[16:18:36] <Kalinox> Yes.
[16:18:39] <robertmaxrees> heh - we can't see that ;)
[16:18:53] <Kalinox> This is the demo, trying to get the iframe to work on my website.
[16:19:08] <robertmaxrees> ah, i see your first problem.
[16:19:18] <robertmaxrees> can't really do ajax by just loading files into the browser.
[16:19:39] <Kalinox> Hrrm..
[16:19:49] <robertmaxrees> gotta use a local dev server.
[16:20:31] <Kalinox> Is there something similar I could use that wouldn't require for me to do so?
[16:20:52] <Kalinox> I am hosting a website on a server though. Its online.
[16:21:26] <robertmaxrees> you can't develop on it locally and use ajax unless you setup a local dev environment.
[16:21:32] <robertmaxrees> you could keep uploading files with changes i suppose.
[16:21:36] <robertmaxrees> but that's a PITA and slow.
[16:22:14] <Kalinox> I'm what you would call some sort of beginner. xD I wouldn't know the meaning of what you said.
[16:22:31] <Kalinox> Is there something else I could use?
[16:22:45] <taplar_> when developing you want to simulate a productional environment on your development environment.
[16:22:49] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:23:00] <robertmaxrees> ie if you want to test the ajax while writing things on your own computer, you need a server.
[16:23:06] <robertmaxrees> otherwise the ajax can't work.
[16:23:20] <Kalinox> Well, my website is on my friend's server. o.o
[16:23:52] <taplar_> doesn't change what robert said
[16:23:53] <robertmaxrees> right, but you're loading the example off your computer, right?
[16:24:10] <Kalinox> Nah, off of an online website.
[16:24:12] <Kalinox> On c9.io
[16:24:20] <robertmaxrees> you just linked to a local file for the example.
[16:24:37] <robertmaxrees> you realize file:///C:/Users/User/Desktop/Highl
[16:24:37] <robertmaxrees> y-Configurable-Responsive-Content-Lightbox-Plugin-For-jQuery-popt
[16:24:37] <robertmaxrees> rox/demo/demo1.html
[16:24:54] <robertmaxrees> ^ that's a file, not on a server, right?
[16:24:55] <Kalinox> Aye. so I guess I'll relink the things.
[16:25:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:25:10] <robertmaxrees> "relink the things"
[16:25:16] <Kalinox> XD
[16:25:37] <Kalinox> Sec.
[16:27:31] <Kalinox> Yes, I'm aware that that's local.
[16:28:38] <Kalinox> Uhg..
[16:29:06] <Kalinox> Can't you guys just look at the console on my website.. xD?
[16:29:19] <robertmaxrees> where's the website?
[16:29:29] <taplar_> "i'm a student"
[16:29:57] <Kalinox> (Note, right where the introduction is on the webpage, that's my <a> trying to get it to open lightbox with iframe once I click it )
[16:30:09] <robertmaxrees> where?
[16:30:12] <Kalinox> https://kalinox-pacophp.c9users.io/Portfolio/Accueil.html
[16:30:47] <Kalinox> I know the Audition logo looks big or w/e but I just needed to place the link somewhere temporarely.
[16:31:11] <Kalinox> Don't mind the 2nd console log error (Accordion) , works perfectly fine.
[16:31:24] <taplar_> you are including multiple version of jquery on this page
[16:31:32] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:31:33] <Kalinox> So only one is required?
[16:31:34] <Woet> Kalinox: are you sure you can claim you know programming when you need to ask other people to write your portfolio?
[16:31:36] <taplar_> i see atleast 3
[16:32:07] <Kalinox> We haven't learned JQuery at our college. Only Html/CSS/JS so far.
[16:32:14] <Kalinox> Getting into PHP soonish though.
[16:32:21] <taplar_> including multiple versions of jquery will cause the jQuery element to be overridden and replaced
[16:32:38] <robertmaxrees> Kalinox fwiw jquery IS js ;)
[16:32:46] <taplar_> a side effect that can result is if you include a plugin after one jquery include, and then include another jquery, then the plugin will not be available
[16:32:57] <Kalinox> Yeh, but we haven't fiddled with JQuery yet.
[16:33:02] <taplar_> you only want one version of jquery
[16:33:21] <Kalinox> Alright, I'll remove all but 1
[16:33:49] <Kalinox> I should keep this one considering it's the latest version am I right?
[16:33:50] <Kalinox>         <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[16:33:51] <taplar_> 4 jqueries.  i just spotted the 3.0 include
[16:34:08] <taplar_> so lets talk about that
[16:34:16] <taplar_> what kind of support does your website need?
[16:34:39] <taplar_> what breath of browsers are you expecting to allow users to use?
[16:35:30] <Kalinox> All hopefully. IE, firefox, Chrome, Safari Opera and more.
[16:35:37] <Kalinox> The more the better no?
[16:35:39] <taplar_> ok, what about versions?
[16:35:54] <taplar_> newer ones only?  some older ones?  all older ones?
[16:36:18] <Kalinox> New/Older
[16:36:32] <taplar_> that's an unclear answer
[16:36:34] <robertmaxrees> (generally you just consider one or the other fwiw)
[16:36:42] <Kalinox> New I suppose.
[16:36:49] <robertmaxrees> (you define a "i want to support from IE 8 on" or simialr approach)
[16:37:33] <Kalinox> Aye, but isn't the goal for a website to be approachable for all versions and all browsers?
[16:37:58] <taplar_> what about a browser that has 0.5% market share?
[16:38:27] <Kalinox> Would it matter? Why not include everyone instead of excluding some?
[16:38:28] <taplar_> what if that browser has an anomaly that is different from other browsers, and you'd have to code specifically for it?
[16:38:34] <taplar_> ROI
[16:38:36] <robertmaxrees> Kalinox there are features that simply don't exist in some older browsers.
[16:38:38] <taplar_> is it worth it?
[16:38:45] <Kalinox> For the IE I'd understand. Is it worth? might.
[16:38:59] <robertmaxrees> it's not "for the IE"
[16:39:11] <robertmaxrees> it's "for IE <version>"
[16:39:29] <taplar_> and the IE support offered differs from 1.x, 2.x and 3.x
[16:39:46] <Kalinox> I'm aware some things might not be as responsive or animated for certain browser versions.. But I guess I'd have to start with the most popular ones.
[16:39:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:39:57] <taplar_> not not responsive
[16:39:58] <taplar_> broken
[16:40:10] <Kalinox> I see.
[16:40:22] <taplar_> not all logic available in IE 10 is available in IE 7
[16:40:37] <taplar_> same with other browsers and their versions
[16:40:47] <robertmaxrees> Kalinox for instance, I'm working on something right now that will never work for IE 11 or below.  edge should be compat sometiome soonish maybe.
[16:40:52] <Kalinox> I think I'm going to stick around this IRC server. I love learning this stuff and this is the only place that I've found that actually has peeps like you teaching me things. :)
[16:40:57] <taplar_> which is why you have to decide what versions you want to support, so you know to provide any logic that they may be missing
[16:41:31] <Kalinox> Well, what would you suggest?
[16:41:39] <taplar_> find out what support you must have
[16:41:47] <taplar_> that will dictate your answer
[16:42:01] <Kalinox> How do I find out? o.o
[16:42:09] <taplar_> who is the owner of this project?
[16:42:14] <taplar_> who are you writing it for?
[16:42:28] <taplar_> whose expectations are you coding for?
[16:42:49] <Sirisian|Work> Does jquery expose a way to run custom functions for .on and .off with custom events? So if I do $(this).on('custom', () => {}); the underlying system could really call $(this).on('click ...', () => { do stuff; customhandler(); }); and then $(this).off('custom') would run a custom off handler to clean up everything?
[16:43:16] <robertmaxrees> Sirisian|Work i'm guessing you want to basiocally namespace your handlers?
[16:43:36] <Kalinox> Writing it for employers.. Expectations are for teachers.. I am the owner of this project.. I'm a Multimedia Integrator.. We learn everything but don't really go deep into certain subjects. Such as programming.
[16:43:57] <taplar_> so you are making an app to sell?
[16:44:08] <taplar_> or license or whatever
[16:44:52] <Kalinox> Nah, not selling. This is just to show what I can do/learned, who I am, a way of contacting me.. That's about it.
[16:45:02] <robertmaxrees> so it's a portfolio for yourself.
[16:45:09] <Kalinox> Aye. o.o
[16:45:20] <Kalinox> Sorry if I sound dumb or w/e..
[16:45:20] <taplar_> then newest would probably be fine
[16:45:49] <Kalinox> Alright. :)
[16:46:19] <Kalinox> So now that this is figured out, I should keep the          <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>         ?
[16:46:27] <taplar_> yup
[16:46:34] <Kalinox> I'll get rid of the rest.
[16:46:42] <taplar_> and it needs to appear before the plugin include
[16:48:11] <Sirisian|Work> robertmaxrees, Well I'm trying avoid the alternative of writing a jquery extension that does $(this).oncustom(() => { }); and $(this).offcustom() since it seems weird. More specifically I wrote code for multiclick that returns the number of clicks within 250 ms on an element. I'd like to just do $(this).multiclick((e, clicks) => { }) or $(this).on('multiclick', ...); Keeps it similar to jquery. I have a lot of cases that
[16:48:11] <Sirisian|Work> require the event to know if something is single, double, or tripple clicked.
[16:49:16] <Kalinox> I fixed it. ^-^ so what's the next step to get that lightbox working? o.o
[16:49:36] <taplar_> what errors are you getting now?
[16:51:06] <Kalinox> http://i66.tinypic.com/f5802c.png
[16:52:45] <Kalinox> I could add you to my c9.io website o.o
[16:52:55] <Kalinox> More than one person can work on the stuff. :)
[16:53:05] <Kalinox> Or check whats up ^^
[16:55:32] <Kalinox> Hullo? o:
[16:55:33] <robertmaxrees> we know ;)
[16:55:39] <Kalinox> Ahh :3
[16:55:41] <robertmaxrees> sometimes people get busy, yo.
[16:55:49] <Kalinox> Truue. o.o
[16:55:52] <robertmaxrees> so what does that error say?
[16:55:56] <robertmaxrees> what does it clue you in to?
[16:56:15] <taplar_> didn't you say you removed all jquery versions but the 3?
[16:56:23] <robertmaxrees> Sirisian|Work you know that jquery events support namespacinbg, right?
[16:56:32] <Sirisian|Work> yes
[16:56:44] <robertmaxrees> so why doesn't that work here?
[16:56:47] <Sirisian|Work> oh I figured it out. I just wrote an extension for .on and .off
[16:56:59] <Kalinox> Yes taplar. Unless I missed one.. o.o
[16:57:10] <taplar_> for some reason it's saying jquery 2.x in the console
[16:58:00] <Kalinox> You mean 3.2.1?
[16:58:16] <Kalinox> That's the one I kept.
[16:58:18] <robertmaxrees> he means 2.x O.o
[16:58:24] <Kalinox> Hmm.
[16:58:33] <taplar_> and i'm not seeing where it's coming from right now
[16:59:32] <Kalinox> Trying to figure out what you're speaking of. Hold on.
[16:59:48] <robertmaxrees> make sure the contents of that one file are what you think theya re.
[17:00:25] <taplar_> it says v3 in the actual file
[17:00:34] <robertmaxrees> link to the page?
[17:00:40] <taplar_> https://kalinox-pacophp.c9users.io/Portfolio/Accueil.html
[17:01:06] <robertmaxrees> view-source:https://kalinox-pacophp.c9users.io/Portfolio/js/lightbox-plus-jquery.min.js
[17:01:34] <taplar_> lol, crap
[17:01:34] <robertmaxrees> ^ there's ytour problem.
[17:01:45] <Kalinox> Yeh that's the lightbox I got working for the website o.o
[17:02:07] <Kalinox> When I click the images they lightbox.. :)
[17:02:10] <taplar_> which includes a version of jquery
[17:02:16] <Kalinox> I see... x:
[17:02:18] <robertmaxrees> it's including its own version of jquery.  weren't you going to use poptrox for a lightbox?
[17:02:35] <Kalinox> So I can only keep one is what you're saying...
[17:03:02] <Kalinox> Considering poptrox has many options I guess I'll try and get that one working..? o_O
[17:03:50] <Kalinox> And get rid of the lightbox I currently have..
[17:04:22] <taplar_> or find a version of it that does not include jquery with it
[17:04:26] <taplar_> *shrug*
[17:05:08] <taplar_> bundling jquery with the file like that is probably meant to be for convenience, but it can lead to issues (as you are seeing) if you decide to upgrade
[17:05:25] <taplar_> otherwise, you could try taking out the 3x version and just using the one that comes bundled with the other
[17:05:36] <taplar_> lots of different choices
[17:05:57] <Kalinox> I'm curious to know about the accordion, I bought that one and it came with JQuery I think.
[17:06:35] <Kalinox> I'd go with that version. Considering I bought it.. @_@
[17:06:53] <taplar_> you bought an accordion?
[17:07:03] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[17:07:46] <Kalinox> Yeh. o.o
[17:09:00] <Kalinox> I also bought this JQuery that I have no clue how to make it work xD ..
[17:09:09] <taplar_> when you say 'bought' ?
[17:09:09] <robertmaxrees> heh, first big lesson: don't pay for jQuery anything.
[17:09:15] <Kalinox> Its like, an infinite gallery with many other things..
[17:09:28] <robertmaxrees> taplar_ he means the plugin, not the jQuery library.
[17:09:36] <Kalinox> Yeh, the plugin. Sorry. o.o
[17:09:38] <taplar_> idk, that last statement...
[17:09:41] <taplar_> k
[17:09:43] <taplar_> lol
[17:09:47] <Kalinox> xD
[17:09:53] <robertmaxrees> heh - Kalinox fwiw when you're talking about a plugin, call it a plugin.
[17:10:03] <robertmaxrees> it's not "jQuery" - it's just a plugin.
[17:10:04] <Kalinox> I used to always call it JQuery. Sorry.
[17:10:14] <Kalinox> The more yknow.. Eh?
[17:10:15] <robertmaxrees> also, jQuery isn't a language on its own.
[17:10:20] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:10:39] <Kalinox> But yeh, I bought 2 plugins. One of them not knowing how to make it work.
[17:11:01] <taplar_> what are the two plugins?
[17:11:12] <Kalinox> One is an accordion that's working. (In the page I showed you)
[17:11:17] <Kalinox> Still need to replace the images/content.
[17:11:34] <Kalinox> And well, the other one I could give you a link to the file. Could be usefull for you guys.
[17:11:37] <taplar_> the lightbox plugin?
[17:11:53] <Kalinox> No, accordion plugin. But the other plugin isn't on the website atm.
[17:13:13] <taplar_> who did you buy it from?
[17:13:26] <Kalinox> Good question. Let me check.
[17:13:31] <taplar_> the accordion one that is
[17:13:34] <Kalinox> One I bought for like 50$, the other one 11$
[17:13:43] <Kalinox> The accordion cost me 50-60$
[17:13:47] <robertmaxrees> HOLY WOAH
[17:13:51] <robertmaxrees> yikes.
[17:13:59] <Kalinox> Yeh.. Shit happens. xD
[17:14:02] <taplar_> did you have to implement it or did someone implement it for you?
[17:14:17] <Kalinox> I implemented it myself. Still got 1 error from console log because of it.
[17:16:39] <Kalinox> http://www.cssjquery.com/ Bought it from this website
[17:17:56] <taplar_> ok, regardless of the outcome of this discussion, i feel like i should say a couple things
[17:17:57] <robertmaxrees> because you didn't want the watermark?
[17:18:17] <Kalinox> Precisely robert.
[17:18:28] <taplar_> first off, before buying something like that, PLEASE pop your head into here or #web or some other room.
[17:18:40] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[17:18:52] <Kalinox> Lesson learned.
[17:18:52] <taplar_> the open source community is large.  there is a good chance you can find what you want out there for no $$$
[17:19:10] <Kalinox> I suppose, but wouldn't that be illegal xD?
[17:19:11] <robertmaxrees> or something even better
[17:19:20] <Kalinox> Okayz. o:
[17:19:21] <robertmaxrees> Kalinox open source often means free.
[17:19:23] <taplar_> open source !== breaking copyright
[17:19:44] <robertmaxrees> or theft.
[17:19:49] <taplar_> it typically means, we made this, use it as you like, don't blame us if it breaks your shit
[17:19:52] <robertmaxrees> like, people build plugins entirely for free.
[17:19:59] <robertmaxrees> think bootstrap.  or jqui.
[17:20:33] <Kalinox> Yeh. Sadly I didn't use a bootstrap.
[17:20:39] <Kalinox> I learned about that mid session.
[17:21:05] <taplar_> secondly.  it feels slightly odd that you are making a part of your site to illustrate your programming ability, but it is being built with pre-made stuff
[17:21:07] <Kalinox> So basicly all my content is kinda.. Well, very much not aligned xD
[17:21:43] <Kalinox> We aren't programmers at heart. We learn a lot of other things. Not just programming.
[17:21:59] <Kalinox> We just get showned basics at our college.. Then they expect us to make awesome things.
[17:22:19] <Kalinox> But the slideshow, I made it by hand though o.o
[17:22:28] <robertmaxrees> then you're a programmer.
[17:22:35] <robertmaxrees> you just need to learn.
[17:22:47] <Kalinox> Yeh..
[17:22:56] <robertmaxrees> fwiw a lot of us have learned without any formal schooling whatsoever :) so you just gotta get the tools to learn.
[17:23:09] <taplar_> not dissing formal schooling
[17:23:20] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:23:22] <Kalinox> Mhmm. But now I got 2 weeks left to hand this website in..
[17:23:27] <robertmaxrees> yeah, 100%.  nor are we dissing you.
[17:23:43] <robertmaxrees> just giving you some really valuable advice.
[17:23:44] <taplar_> sure.  i'm just pointing out the oddity i find with the site concept
[17:23:52] <Kalinox> Gotta add a Plugin for videos and a plugin to show my projects I made through out the years. Once thats done I have to make it responsive for Ipad/Iphone plateforms.
[17:24:07] <L|T> Formal schoolings useful if you get a teacher who can answer your questions.
[17:24:13] <robertmaxrees> heh, that's not going to work as well as you think Kalinox
[17:24:13] <Kalinox> Once thats done I have to work on 5 other projects @_@
[17:24:16] <L|T> But, irc has that too
[17:24:25] <taplar_> if i'm an employer, and you're trying to get a development job, as a programmer, and you show me a website that you made using a lot of premade things, i'm going to question your ability
[17:24:38] <Kalinox> LT, our teachers suck.. Badly >_> One of them dosen't even know html.
[17:24:52] <L|T> Hence why they teach
[17:24:55] <L|T> most of the time
[17:25:35] <robertmaxrees> L|T that old saying really doesn't work as well any more as we like to think it does ;)
[17:25:50] <robertmaxrees> good higher education will hire teachers that are actively working in the industry.
[17:25:55] <L|T> I just went through college last year
[17:26:10] <L|T> It's freaking true
[17:26:20] <Kalinox> Are you guys familliar with all the Adobe's?
[17:26:21] <taplar_> consider that your sample size may be limited
[17:26:24] <robertmaxrees> i'm not saying that there isn't a quality issue, but it's simply not a hard and fast rule.
[17:26:31] <robertmaxrees> Kalinox "the Adobe's"?
[17:26:39] <robertmaxrees> you mean the different tools they offer?
[17:26:44] <Kalinox> Aye.
[17:26:49] <taplar_> drawing a conclusion from your experience at one college isn't enough to make a global statement, imho
[17:26:56] <robertmaxrees> sure.  hardly use 'em tbh.
[17:27:35] <L|T> Another person is saying the same thing here
[17:27:46] <L|T> thats 2 in under a minute
[17:27:50] <taplar_> ok, two colleges.  still not a relevant sample size
[17:27:57] <Kalinox> We learned how to use them through out the years. We aren't specialized in programming. Hence why a Multimedia Integrator isn't called programmer.
[17:28:04] <L|T> keep you incrementer going lol
[17:28:23] <L|T> I can give you a ton of references.
[17:28:46] <L|T> If you have true skills and passion. Why teach. There are endless things to develop.
[17:28:49] <robertmaxrees> L|T i know plenty of people who had professors that were actively working in the industry.
[17:28:55] <taplar_> i like teaching
[17:29:03] <robertmaxrees> L|T because you want to enable other people to build neat stuff.
[17:29:04] <L|T> All of mine were
[17:29:13] <taplar_> seeing the lightbulb go off in someone's head is great
[17:29:16] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[17:29:17] <taplar_> err, on
[17:29:23] <taplar_> weird phrase
[17:29:24] <L|T> That is hilarious
[17:29:25] <robertmaxrees> why do you think we hang out in here? :)
[17:29:29] <L|T> You must be teachers
[17:29:31] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:29:32] <L|T> lmao
[17:29:43] <taplar_> active developer for an ecommerse business
[17:29:48] <taplar_> doesn't mean i hate teaching
[17:29:54] <robertmaxrees> same here.  fairly large one at that.
[17:30:06] <robertmaxrees> gotta give back to the greater good somehow.
[17:30:13] <L|T> <robertmaxrees> schools people here all day long
[17:30:16] <Kalinox> My only goal is to make web browser games eventually. :3
[17:30:20] <taplar_> which is my whole point.  making judgements without info to back it up
[17:30:30] <Kalinox> I made a canvas once.. But I'll need to learn how to use an engine eventually.
[17:30:33] <L|T> for recognition?
[17:31:24] <robertmaxrees> L|T who was that towards?
[17:31:45] <L|T> that you school people here all day?
[17:31:49] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:31:58] <L|T> for recognition?
[17:32:01] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:32:09] <robertmaxrees> I do it because I feel the need to give back to the greater community.
[17:32:19] <robertmaxrees> and also because it's a great mental break sometimes.
[17:32:35] <taplar_> i started doing it for continuous learning
[17:32:36] <L|T> It has to feed your ego
[17:32:40] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:32:42] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[17:32:46] <L|T> Common
[17:32:47] <robertmaxrees> I feel fulfilled doing it.
[17:32:59] <robertmaxrees> hell my boss supports it.
[17:33:10] <Kalinox> If I had the knowledge to help, I'd do it just because its fun.
[17:33:11] <taplar_> L|T: telling 500 people how to use delegates repeatedly doesn't fill the ego
[17:33:19] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[17:33:25] <robertmaxrees> if i wanted an ego trip, i'
[17:33:25] <L|T> What are you doing it for?
[17:33:34] <robertmaxrees> i already explained why :)
[17:33:35] <L|T> the greater good
[17:33:39] <robertmaxrees> yeahj
[17:33:42] <taplar_> continuous learning and for fun
[17:33:43] <L|T> seriously
[17:33:45] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:33:50] <L|T> seriously
[17:33:57] <Kalinox> Why not?
[17:34:06] <robertmaxrees> why is that so hard to believe?
[17:34:20] <robertmaxrees> People offer entire online classes for free.
[17:34:23] <L|T> You receive pleasure from it.
[17:34:31] <taplar_> lol, sure
[17:34:32] <Kalinox> We are all people on one big rock. Aiming for the greater good of us all.
[17:34:44] <robertmaxrees> I like the experience of helping people learn, yes.
[17:35:04] <L|T> Do you use stackoverflow?
[17:35:09] <taplar_> sure
[17:35:14] <robertmaxrees> sometimes, yeah.
[17:35:31] <Kalinox> I go on there sometimes to see if I can find helpful things o.o
[17:36:05] <L|T> I think we all do. There is no choice's anymore.
[17:36:16] <robertmaxrees> eh.
[17:36:30] <taplar_> i'm unclear about the stackoverflow question though
[17:36:31] <robertmaxrees> a lot of content on SO is inaccurate/wrong/outdated.  i experienced it again today.
[17:37:10] <L|T> I believe it.
[17:38:34] <L|T> There is a big difference from some ego maniac, on an ego trip and the way I have seen robertmaxrees help people.
[17:39:20] <Kalinox> So... about that plugin I was working on... xD
[17:39:39] <Kalinox> What version is the accordion using?
[17:40:45] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy to find out.
[17:40:48] <robertmaxrees> open up the file.
[17:43:10] <Kalinox> Its using 		<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
[17:43:22] <robertmaxrees> 2.1.0
[17:43:25] <Kalinox> Yup.
[17:43:32] <Kalinox> So I have to regress to 2.1.0 because of it.
[17:44:00] <robertmaxrees> you will?
[17:44:13] <robertmaxrees> isn't there a version of the plugin without jquery included?
[17:44:56] <Kalinox> Doubt it. Let me look at the one I bought
[17:46:11] <Kalinox> Nah, still the same thing at the bottom of the html file.
[17:46:13] <Kalinox> 2.1.0
[17:47:09] <robertmaxrees> that's really frustrating.
[17:47:34] <Kalinox> Yeh.. Specially cuzz I bought it for so much.
[17:48:08] <robertmaxrees> i'd just delete the copy of jquery in there but *meh*
[17:48:40] <Kalinox> o.o? I found the direct link to the paid version btw XD
[17:48:48] <Kalinox> You can download the commercial archive from here: http://www.flashxml.net/paid/accordion/accordion.zip
[17:48:56] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[17:49:08] <Kalinox> So yeh, free for u :3
[17:49:16] <robertmaxrees> sooo
[17:49:19] <robertmaxrees> kind of not cool fwiw.
[17:49:24] <Kalinox> fwiw ?
[17:49:28] <robertmaxrees> for what it's worth
[17:49:40] <Kalinox> Yeh...
[17:49:47] <robertmaxrees> just because we think it's dumb doesn't mean we support people encouraging others to "steal"
[17:50:27] <Kalinox> Hmm o.o
[17:51:17] <taplar_> I just encourage you to ask around before hand next time, ;)
[17:51:23] <Kalinox> Yup ^^
[17:51:37] <Kalinox> So... 2.1.0 it is.. o.o
[17:51:50] <Kalinox> I'll probably remake my whole website at some point anyways..
[17:51:57] <Kalinox> But only after this session is over >_>
[17:55:58] <Kalinox> So considering this is 2.1.0 I guess I'll have to check and see what version my lightbox is @
[17:57:11] <Kalinox> I'm confused, even though I did remove 2.1.0 and left it at 3.2.1 the accordion still works..?
[17:57:22] <robertmaxrees> not surprising
[17:57:42] <robertmaxrees> newer version of jquery can support old stuff.
[17:57:45] <robertmaxrees> not always.
[17:57:48] <robertmaxrees> but generally.
[17:57:53] <Kalinox> Oh, thats good then. :)
[18:01:11] <Kalinox> Lightbox's are working as well though.
[18:01:33] <Kalinox> So I'm guessing all that needs to be done is the Iframe Lightbox Tropbox or w/e..
[18:01:49] <Kalinox> But you said that in the console log it wasn't the right version.. Which confuses me.
[18:02:22] <taplar_> i was typing jQuery in the console and it said it was 2.1.4
[18:02:39] <taplar_> which you said you only had 3.2.x in there.  which led me to believe there were multiple versions
[18:03:24] <Kalinox> Aye. so I did get rid of all the other versions in the html.
[18:03:31] <Kalinox> except for 3.2.1
[18:04:24] <taplar_> not except.  as that one file had a jquery version and a lightbox bundled together.  so you actually still had two at that time
[18:05:18] <taplar_> so if it is still in that state, we're still at the desire to have just one jquery version
[18:05:42] <Kalinox> This is what I have in the html
[18:05:43] <Kalinox> https://jsfiddle.net/fbcq3rdc/
[18:06:59] <taplar_> so you removed that one that was lightbox-with-jquery-min or whatever?
[18:07:51] <Kalinox> The min files are Jquery? I see.
[18:08:08] <Kalinox> I thought JQuery was only from https links.
[18:08:21] <taplar_> no
[18:08:32] <robertmaxrees> you can load your own locally hosted jQuery file.
[18:09:15] <Kalinox> I see.. Then theres many JQuery files locally..
[18:09:19] <Kalinox> Wondering which one I should remove.. @_@
[18:09:21] <Kalinox> http://i64.tinypic.com/2nlfq69.png
[18:09:34] <taplar_> uh, maybe there is still some confusion
[18:09:40] <taplar_> not everything is 'jQuery'
[18:10:06] <Kalinox> Yeh. Some are JS files I made..
[18:10:10] <taplar_> when we say jQuery what we are typically referring to is any javascript that (re)creates the window.jQuery variable
[18:11:32] <taplar_> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.js this is 'jQuery'
[18:11:49] <taplar_> most of them will have comments like that at the top
[18:12:30] <taplar_> other plugins may have something similar, but they are not typically called just jQuery.  they are plugins
[18:13:04] <Kalinox> Well, I'm going to delete the lightbox, cuzz I found out its 2.1.4
[18:13:13] <Kalinox> *Takes a deep breathe of sighs*
[18:13:17] <robertmaxrees> that lightbox probably has a version without jquery in it.
[18:13:23] <Kalinox> You're going to help me through this if I do so right xD?
[18:13:34] <taplar_> ^ or again, you could try using that version and not using 3.2.1
[18:14:02] <taplar_> that file would just need to appear before any other jquery plugin includes
[18:14:09] <Kalinox> Heres a list of what I found:
[18:14:13] <Kalinox> Lightbox:  * jQuery JavaScript Library v2.1.4
[18:14:25] <Kalinox>  jquery.poptrox.js v2.5.1 | (c) n33 | n33.co | MIT licensed */
[18:14:34] <taplar_> that's a plugin
[18:14:48] <Kalinox> ./*! jQuery v1.11.3 | (c) 2005, 2015 jQuery Foundation, Inc. | jquery.org/license */
[18:14:59] <taplar_> jQuery core
[18:15:29] <Kalinox> ./*! jQuery UI - v1.10.4 - 2014-05-14 * http://jqueryui.com
[18:15:35] <robertmaxrees> jquery ui
[18:15:43] <robertmaxrees> not jquery
[18:15:45] <taplar_> which may or may not be compatible with 3.x
[18:15:49] <robertmaxrees> are you picking up on the pattern here?
[18:15:50] <taplar_> idr
[18:15:52] <Kalinox> ./**  * Swiper 3.1.0  * Most modern mobile touch slider and framework with hardware accelerated transitions
[18:16:30] <Kalinox> *picking up the pattern atm on what you said*
[18:17:18] <Kalinox> So.. I can just remove the lightbox one right?
[18:17:33] <Kalinox> The jquery ui is ok?
[18:17:41] <Kalinox> And the core as well?
[18:17:54] <Kalinox> Or can I remove the core?
[18:18:16] <robertmaxrees> what do you think?
[18:18:17] <robertmaxrees> :)_
[18:18:47] <taplar_> i'd have to refer to robert to see if he knows if jquery ui has been updated to work with 3.x yet
[18:18:54] <taplar_> but that's a fairly older version of it
[18:19:23] <robertmaxrees> not that i'm aware of.
[18:20:04] <Kalinox> Hmmm remove old JQuery core and old pluging JQuery? o.o
[18:22:01] <taplar_> do you use the jquery ui?
[18:23:05] <Kalinox> Good question.
[18:23:13] <Kalinox> To be honest I'm not sure what I'm using and what I aren't.
[18:23:28] <Kalinox> Because I didn't really know how JQuery worked till you guys showed up.
[18:23:51] <robertmaxrees> btw it's a lowercase j :) jQuery.
[18:23:54] <robertmaxrees> just fyi.
[18:24:01] <taplar_> it might be a good idea to take a breather and try to make some sort of a list of what all you are actually using
[18:24:31] <Kalinox> I guess I'll do that right now.
[18:27:25] <Kalinox> I deleted everything except for the poptrox and everything still works ^^
[18:29:43] <Kalinox> But it didn't fix anything in the console log o.o
[18:30:35] <robertmaxrees> because you're loading poptrox before jquery
[18:33:22] <Sirisian|Work> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/rhsswfho/ I don't think it memory leaks at least. That was a fun experiment.
[18:34:23] <Kalinox> My accordion isnt working anymore @_@ *cries*
[18:43:05] <Kalinox> Wow, you wouldn't believe how much shizzles I deleted. xD
[18:58:35] <Kalinox> Brb in 1 hour
[19:12:00] <develooper> How can i evaluate jquery in a local scope ?
[19:12:22] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[19:13:13] <develooper> Because I have another jquery library version in my pages. What i'm doing right now , i created a third party js client sdk, which uses jquery also(another version)
[19:13:32] <develooper> So I want to evaluate in a local scope that dependency jquery
[19:13:41] <develooper> Any ideas ?
[19:15:14] <robertmaxrees> hold up.
[19:15:22] <robertmaxrees> why are you including multiple versions of jquery?
[19:16:54] <develooper> robertmaxrees: I'm creating thirdparty js api(sdk) , which does evaluate its dependency library script like jquery handlebars etc. , and that sdk appends some htmls if some events occur.
[19:17:26] <develooper> robertmaxrees: By the way i'm making like a livechat client sdk.
[19:17:27] <robertmaxrees> so you can use noConflict, but I'd be really careful with what you're doing.
[19:18:02] <develooper> robertmaxrees: i tried it but no way.
[19:18:10] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[19:18:16] <develooper> robertmaxrees: when i evaluate jquery in eval('jquery lib is here')
[19:18:23] <robertmaxrees> nonono
[19:18:30] <develooper> robertmaxrees: some my page's functions gives error
[19:18:30] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you do that.
[19:18:42] <develooper> robertmaxrees: like .size() function
[19:18:52] <develooper> robertmaxrees: because different versions
[19:19:07] <robertmaxrees> so what did you try with noconflict?
[19:19:37] <robertmaxrees> because you should really avoid using eval here.
[19:20:48] <develooper> robertmaxrees: how can i evaluate jquery then ?
[19:21:44] <robertmaxrees> "evaluate" or "not conflict"?
[19:21:52] <robertmaxrees> because it seems like you're conflating concepts.
[19:22:44] <develooper> robertmaxrees: included client sdk on page -> clientsdk evaluates jquery and handlebars -> then some jquery events gives error on my page
[19:22:50] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[19:22:53] <robertmaxrees> "evaluates"?
[19:23:00] <robertmaxrees> you keep using that word.
[19:23:09] <robertmaxrees> can you show what you're trying to do?
[19:23:16] <develooper> robertmaxrees: i mean eval() func
[19:23:25] <robertmaxrees> show me your code pls.
[19:23:32] <robertmaxrees> because it really sounds like you're misunderstanding something.
[19:23:46] <develooper> robertmaxrees: ok wait
[19:24:53] <develooper> robertmaxrees: I make an XHR request to get dependency script in my sdk. then I use that  eval(xhrObj.responseText);
[19:25:25] <develooper> robertmaxrees: but after some jquery events give me error which are already in page
[19:25:31] <robertmaxrees> hold up.
[19:25:40] <robertmaxrees> so why are you using xhr to get dependencies.
[19:25:46] <develooper> robertmaxrees: but in my client-sdk jquery events are running nicely
[19:26:15] <develooper> robertmaxrees: because it must be dynamic
[19:26:25] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:26:34] <robertmaxrees> you're not generating logic, are you?
[19:27:16] <develooper> robertmaxrees: I'm generating logic
[19:27:47] <robertmaxrees> that's a really bad idea.  and the problems you're having are a big part of why.
[19:28:02] <develooper> robertmaxrees: Otherwise i need to use iframe but it occurs another different problems
[19:28:06] <robertmaxrees> you should really only be fetching config vars via that xhr call and then calling stuff after it's not.
[19:28:08] <robertmaxrees> *done
[19:28:34] <robertmaxrees> generating code is generally a really painful, bad concept.
[19:29:15] <develooper> robertmaxrees: yes its painful right now, but any idea without iframe can i eval scripts in a local scope ?
[19:30:43] <robertmaxrees> also: jquery is setup in a way to not really support that idea.
[19:30:47] <robertmaxrees> hence why you'd need noconflict.
[19:31:13] <develooper> robertmaxrees: how can i use noconflict in this scenario
[19:31:28] <robertmaxrees> start by not using eval.
[19:31:29] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:31:55] <develooper> page -> included jquery 1.8 -> some jquery codes -> client-sdk -> eval jquery3 -> some jquery codes according to sdk
[19:32:15] <robertmaxrees> dude
[19:32:16] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:32:23] <robertmaxrees> using eval on jquery isn't going to fix anything.
[19:32:50] <robertmaxrees> it's only going to create problems.
[19:32:59] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/
[19:33:00] <develooper> robertmaxrees: can i create new script dom element to add that dependencies ? ?
[19:33:06] <robertmaxrees> you can do that.
[19:33:20] <robertmaxrees> though honestly you shouldn't be doiung that if you're providing a 3rd party service.
[19:33:24] <develooper> robertmaxrees: Okay then it can be same thing what i am doing right ?
[19:33:25] <robertmaxrees> not unless you're running it in an iframe.
[19:33:41] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're going to add pageweight that doesn't need to be there.
[19:34:27] <develooper> robertmaxrees: yeah but the client-sdk must make ajax calls to my main page
[19:34:56] <develooper> robertmaxrees: in iframe that's impossible
[19:35:11] <develooper> robertmaxrees: and also that sdk must reach my dom elements also
[19:37:07] <develooper> robertmaxrees: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14521108/dynamically-load-js-inside-js/14521482#14521482 that answer
[19:37:26] <develooper> robertmaxrees: can i use noconflict before create that element ?
[19:40:01] <develooper> robertmaxrees: any example creating like that 3rd party client sdk
[19:42:36] <robertmaxrees> back
[19:42:50] <develooper> robertmaxrees: im here, welcome back
[19:43:07] <robertmaxrees> so you're misunderstanding the iframe solution.
[19:43:18] <robertmaxrees> the iframe would house everything.
[19:43:45] <robertmaxrees> you wouldn't have anything on the parent page.
[19:43:57] <robertmaxrees> why does it need to reach outside of the iframe?
[19:44:00] <develooper> robertmaxrees:  yeah i know it works like this perfectly
[19:44:18] <develooper> robertmaxrees: because it have to go some urls in my main page.
[19:44:24] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[19:44:55] <develooper> robertmaxrees: it is a chatbot widget basically, the widget administrator can give some ajax calls to operate it
[19:45:15] <robertmaxrees> like, to initialize it?
[19:45:21] <develooper> robertmaxrees: yes
[19:45:35] <robertmaxrees> you'd do that via the querystring params on the iframe source.
[19:45:51] <develooper> robertmaxrees: https://www.intercom.com/ see that right bottom corner , my widget is like that but chatbot
[19:46:22] <robertmaxrees> i'm familiar with these - my company uses one but for real people.
[19:46:24] <develooper> robertmaxrees: so that bot have to call my endpoints via ajax
[19:46:40] <robertmaxrees> that's fine - the iframe can use ajax just fine.
[19:46:43] <robertmaxrees> it's a full page.
[19:46:52] <robertmaxrees> that example you just linked uses an iframe, fwiw.
[19:49:20] <develooper> yeah but www.mydomain.com -> inits iframe like www.asd.com
[19:49:29] <robertmaxrees> and?
[19:49:32] <develooper> robertmaxrees: how can that iframe ajax mydomain.com
[19:49:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:49:54] <robertmaxrees> the chat iframe is hosted via asd.com, right?
[19:50:00] <develooper> yeah may be
[19:50:04] <robertmaxrees> err.
[19:50:09] <robertmaxrees> you should know >.>
[19:50:37] <robertmaxrees> so there's clientsite.com and iframehost.com, right?
[19:50:49] <develooper> yeah
[19:51:13] <robertmaxrees> so clientsite.com includes the stuff to make an iframe that points to iframehost.com
[19:51:18] <robertmaxrees> right?
[19:51:23] <develooper> yes
[19:51:39] <robertmaxrees> so when does the iframe need to reach over to clientsite.com?
[19:52:38] <develooper> an user write a command ro bot , show me the stocks
[19:52:52] <develooper> so that bot needs to call my endpoints
[19:53:17] <robertmaxrees> right, so because the iframe source is iframehost, you don't need to worry about that.
[19:53:30] <robertmaxrees> the iframe can ajax back to iframehost.com just fine.
[19:53:37] <develooper> no
[19:53:39] <robertmaxrees> since you won't be running into cors.
[19:53:45] <robertmaxrees> why no?
[19:53:48] <develooper> iframehost.com -> call ajax clientsite.com
[19:53:58] <robertmaxrees> why would it need to do that?
[19:54:25] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to take the user to a different page?
[19:55:27] <develooper> robertmaxrees: clientsite.com uses bot -> bot in iframe but it needs to reach clientsite.com endpoints to reply user correct data
[19:55:55] <robertmaxrees> so there are a few ways to approach that.
[19:56:06] <robertmaxrees> one would be to have them create those endpoints and enable CORS on them.
[19:56:15] <robertmaxrees> the other would be to proxy those through your own server.
[19:58:23] <develooper> robertmaxrees: so it causes extra development cost
[19:58:39] <robertmaxrees> what you're proposing to do would cost them real dollars ;)
[19:58:48] <robertmaxrees> since pagespeed has impact on conversion.
[19:59:09] <robertmaxrees> and I know if I were asked to implement something that, among other things, important its own copy of jquery, i'd be none too pleased.
[19:59:19] <robertmaxrees> *imported
[20:01:13] <robertmaxrees> and what you're trying to do suggests that you're going to build a custom parser for the client site.
[20:01:22] <develooper> robertmaxrees: so i have to use native methods instead of jquery methods in my client sdk , right?
[20:02:08] <robertmaxrees> that's generally advisable.  or rethink what your cient sdk is doing so it's not working so hard.
[20:03:57] <develooper> robertmaxrees: any example like that scenario 3rd party sdk source code ?
[20:06:20] <robertmaxrees> i mean, not really.  pretty much all the ones I know of use iframes heh
[21:07:17] <Kalinox> Anyone here :3?
[21:58:04] <raj> Kalinox, what's up?
