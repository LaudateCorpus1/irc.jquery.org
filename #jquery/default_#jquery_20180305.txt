[00:00:00] <Neo4> Robdgreat: it's question
[00:00:09] <Robdgreat> no, I don't only do javascript
[00:00:18] <Robdgreat> it's a strange assumption to make
[00:00:24] <Neo4> Robdgreat: javascript means css and html as well
[00:00:29] <Robdgreat> no it doesn't
[00:01:07] <Robdgreat> but since you appear to be trying to ask if I'm exclusively a front-end developer, the answer is still no
[00:01:54] <Neo4> Robdgreat: see jquery it's like javascript ++ (c and c++) I called jquery exended javascript, we must use it if we work with DOM. because pure javascript it's low level of programming
[00:02:26] <Neo4> but see angularjs it's the same, made for don't use poor javascript and vue.js and react.js
[00:02:50] <Neo4> all of this made for rationalize code, make it more structured
[00:03:34] <Neo4> it's good for teams, because you can do good structure by yourself, and this structure will understand only you
[00:04:01] <Neo4> Robdgreat: do you do server code?
[00:04:10] <Robdgreat> I think your contention that these things are only useful for teams is mistaken
[00:04:17] <Robdgreat> and yes, I do
[00:04:45] <Neo4> Robdgreat: just it seems like people learn many javascript frameworks and libs because they are works in company and do only one kind of work
[00:04:50] <Neo4> Robdgreat: no, only for teams
[00:05:23] <Robdgreat> I have no idea where you're getting your information, because the people I know who use angular etc are full-stack developers
[00:05:30] <Robdgreat> I feel like you're just making this all up
[00:05:39] <Neo4> Robdgreat: it's made for teams, because other human will understand structure angularjs app, and we can show it all people who know angular they will know it too
[00:06:07] <Robdgreat> but this is way off-topic here
[00:06:17] <Robdgreat> sorry to contribute to the noise, everyone
[00:06:52] <Neo4> Robdgreat: I am thinking :) Why need to know a few frameworks? Do you have to know vue, angular, react both together?
[00:08:21] <Neo4> Robdgreat: ok. I think enough one lib, for other only basics for possibilities to read code. Suppose you know 4 libs and will you use all of them in your project? No, only one
[00:13:19] <Neo4> Robdgreat: see it https://vuejsdevelopers.com/2017/05/20/vue-js-safely-jquery-plugin/
[00:13:19] <Neo4> is it not good idea use vie and jqueyr in the same ui avoid it, anywhere it will written for other libs
[00:13:38] <Robdgreat> I don't really care
[00:13:43] <Neo4> why you learn jquery if you are going to use others?
[00:13:52] <Robdgreat> I'm done with this off topic discussion
[00:13:52] <Neo4> it's not streamline
[00:14:09] <Neo4> Robdgreat: ok, I'll silence, thanks for your mind
[00:14:49] <Neo4> We'll appreciate your input :)
[08:48:20] <Buoy172> is there a syntax to add an on-click handler to multiple items
[08:48:45] <Cork> Buoy172: jquery doesn't really make a difference between adding to one or many
[08:48:58] <Cork> just make sure the selector matches all the elements you care about
[08:49:15] <Buoy172> for example var one = $('#one'), two = $('#two');
[08:49:17] <Cork> (and possibly delegate to a common parent if possible to reduce the amount of handlers needed)
[08:49:34] <Cork> $('#one, #two').on()
[08:49:45] <Cork> or possibly better, add a class and use that
[08:50:03] <Buoy172> thanks, I think I'll add a class
[10:35:48] <Neo4> get().reverse() ?
[10:36:07] <Neo4> what is it $($(element).parents().addBack().get().reverse()) :)
[10:37:33] <Neo4> get().reverse() we use for change order?

[13:13:02] <robertmaxrees> goooood morning
[13:13:31] <taplar> morning
[13:14:39] <robertmaxrees> how goes?
[13:15:16] <taplar> pretty good.  still quite
[13:15:22] <taplar> quiet
[13:15:44] <grapheti> quite quiet
[15:02:58] <sadtaco> So I'm getting an error from jquery ui when I set the range to 100 min, 100 step, 600 max. But not when it's 0, 1, 100.  Did 10.4 not support that or something? That can't be it.
[15:07:16] <taplar> 1.10.4?
[15:09:04] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/5zrdn908/2/ it seems to work in 1.9 so I'd assume it'd work in 1.10 sadtaco
[15:09:21] <sadtaco> Ah it was giving number as a string problem
[15:09:26] <sadtaco> parseInt() fixed it
[15:09:43] <sadtaco> but that's strange. I see no reason why jquery ui shouldn't have accepted number strings for constructor
[15:09:54] <sadtaco> (and to not throw a good error about it)
[15:11:15] <taplar> most jquery methods, from my experience, fail silently
[15:13:36] <kaotikus> o/
[15:58:43] <jak2000> is true jQuery is dead?
[15:59:11] <taplar> the library or the chat room?
[15:59:19] <jak2000> library
[15:59:25] <cannap> lol no
[15:59:31] <jak2000> in some groups of Facebook, say...
[15:59:43] <cannap> yea i dont use jquery anymore
[15:59:48] <cannap> but its not dead xD
[15:59:58] <jak2000> cannap wich/what do you use?
[16:00:04] <cannap> 30% of the web is covered with wordpress sites
[16:00:08] <cannap> and wordpress uses jquery
[16:00:09] <cannap> so
[16:00:12] <cannap> its not dead xd
[16:00:20] <cannap> vue
[16:00:31] <cannap> but you cant compare vue with jquery
[16:00:37] <jak2000> then?
[16:00:46] <cannap> vue is datadriven you manipulate the data and vue will make the changes to the dom
[16:00:53] <cannap> and with jquery you select the dom direct
[16:00:54] <taplar> use whatever solves your problem
[16:00:58] <cannap> beer
[16:01:08] <jak2000> taplar you continue use jquery?
[16:01:16] <jak2000> not supported anymore?
[16:01:21] <taplar> yep
[16:01:36] <taplar> sure it is
[16:01:54] <taplar> if by supported you mean there are rooms like this that exist
[16:01:57] <taplar> and the S.O. for it is active
[16:02:14] <cannap> you can also check stackoverflow
[16:08:23] <jak2000> which is: EMACS6  ?
[16:08:55] <taplar> ECMA 6?
[16:11:25] <robertmaxrees> jquery is still in active development, too.
[16:12:32] <jak2000> ok, is only dude, and escuse me if is a ,,,, no topic..
[16:12:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:16:36] <jak2000> escuse me robertbo[m]
[16:16:40] <jak2000> robertmaxrees
[16:17:18] <robertmaxrees> i'm super confused right now lol
[16:17:33] <taplar> ya
[16:23:57] <jak2000> i love jquery... but recommend me reactjs and vue.... super confused tooo :)
[16:25:01] <taplar> if you have a sizable application, then react or vue can make sense
[16:26:34] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:27:19] <robertmaxrees> put differently, sometimes all you need is a screwdriver, some screws, and a few files, instead of a CNC machine.
