[00:00:02] <Cork> and hide/show will solve it for you
[00:00:11] <angelazou> ahhh...you're right
[00:00:16] <angelazou> too blind to see
[00:01:12] <harpal> Cork: Thanks, its working now :D
[00:08:15] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:26:30] <uty> hello
[00:26:56] <uty> I have an application that is using jquery flot for the past 4 or so years
[00:27:40] <uty> lately I notice that sometimes the jquery flot graph loses its dots and lines
[00:27:57] <uty> sort of dissapears but the numbers on the axis remain
[00:28:06] <uty> any ideas?
[00:40:10] <zuloyd> hi
[00:40:20] <zuloyd> does jQuery.getScript work asynchronously?
[00:40:30] <zuloyd> if so, is it possible to wait for it to finish before continuing?
[00:44:34] <oliviernt> it does run async by default. To continue once finished, use the callback functions or (better) the promise returned by the call
[00:44:41] <sacho> zuloyd, use promises
[00:44:48] <sacho> oh, what he siad.
[00:45:16] <oliviernt> there is a nice example here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/#handling-errors
[00:45:54] <zuloyd> what if I have multiple getScripts?
[00:45:59] <zuloyd> how can I do something when all of them have loaded?
[00:47:35] <oliviernt> yeah, you can wait for all of them to be done with $.when(promise1, promise2, ..., promiseN).then(...)

[01:19:36] <ChristW1> I'm having a problem combining the 'select2' (select2-3.3.1.js) and 'mousewheel' (no version given in the plugin) plugins. The 'select2' plugin (line 651) tries to run the 'mousewheel' function w/ a function argument, and this throws an error in the mousewheel plugin. Any pointers?
[01:22:21] <ChristW1> Hum, there are at least _2_ jquery mousewheel plugins :-(
[01:26:00] <theresajayne_> I am trying to get a Jquery to work by name but having problems. any ideas?
[01:26:11] <theresajayne_> http://jsfiddle.net/JktUa/
[01:26:49] <ravenzz> theresajayne_ you forgot to select jQuery from the Frameworks & Extensions panel
[01:26:50] <theresajayne_> works fine with ids but not by name
[01:27:17] <theresajayne_> ah! ok fine thanks
[01:27:19] <ravenzz> also $('[name="test"]')
[01:27:30] <ravenzz> quote the values
[01:27:54] <theresajayne_> the actual code is more complex than that anyway I am precreating the string.
[01:28:35] <ravenzz> just saying
[01:29:54] <ChristW1> Drop my question, it seems that a collegue wrote his own 'mousewheel' plugin, so I need to rename that one...
[01:33:05] <theresajayne_> ravenzz ok its not working on the main page, but the same divs have the same id - do  i need to fix that first
[01:34:44] <ravenzz> theresajayne_ the attribute name can't be used on divs
[01:35:39] <ravenzz> theresajayne_ these are the valid attributes for divs http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/single-page.html#global-attributes
[01:35:43] <ravenzz> what are you trying to do?
[01:36:24] <hagb4rd> hi folks! i found that knockout.js observables and its MVVM based concept very useful, but had to learn it leaks on compatibility with jquery..would you recommend using an alternative solution/lib?
[01:37:27] <hagb4rd> i've they are some
[01:37:32] <hagb4rd> *heard
[01:37:39] <hagb4rd> any suggestions?
[01:39:20] <xec> hagb4rd: do you mean "lacks" rather than "leaks"?
[01:41:32] <xec> hagb4rd: if so, in what sense? knockout even uses jquery internally (when available), it just doesn't depend on it
[01:42:08] <ph88> how do i check if a check box is not checked ? i only find to check if it is checked  .is(':checked')
[01:42:43] <Cork> !$().is()
[01:42:51] <ph88> oh ok thx Cork
[01:47:49] <n0wk> Simple question about adding a class to the parent of an item that shares the same href as another. I am probably doing it wrong. http://jsfiddle.net/uzHrR/
[01:49:39] <Burgov> hi
[01:50:09] <Gazpacho> n0wk: you're using both $(this) and this in the same function, did you think that was going to work out well?
[01:50:22] <Cork> n0wk: http://jsfiddle.net/uzHrR/1/
[01:50:35] <Burgov> in the datepicker "dialog" method 'onSelect' callback, it says i get the date (string) and the datepicker instance. How can I use this datepicker instance to get the actual date object? I've tried instance.getDate(), instance.datepicker('getDate'), but they don't work...
[01:50:50] <MindSpark> hi, does someone know if there's a selector similar to :contains() but returns elements that match the exact text rather than a portion of it?
[01:50:54] <Gazpacho> you probably don't want to do it cork's way
[01:51:09] <Gazpacho> although I suppose you could
[01:51:28] <Cork> i's a lot less messy then doing it the other way
[01:51:33] <aaronmcadam> MindSpark: try $.fn.filter and use a regex
[01:51:52] <Gazpacho> interpolating strings into code is bad tho
[01:51:52] <MindSpark> aaronmcadam: alright, thanks
[01:52:12] <murr4y> hi, what's the correct event for a radio button change? 'change'?
[01:52:39] <Cork> though that said, this is a cleaner way http://jsfiddle.net/uzHrR/2/
[01:52:58] <Cork> murr4y: click
[01:53:27] <murr4y> Cork: but that won't trigger if it's changed with the up arrow key
[01:53:29] <Cork> it's a bit messed up but keyboards trigger click on checkboxes and radio boxes
[01:53:33] <Cork> it will
[01:53:36] <murr4y> oh
[01:53:38] <murr4y> !
[01:53:44] <murr4y> ok, thank you
[01:53:59] <Gazpacho> you also have to check keyboard events to be accessible
[01:54:09] <Cork> no
[01:54:19] <Cork> Gazpacho: like i just said, keyboard events trigger click
[01:54:24] <Gazpacho> oh
[01:54:41] <murr4y> that is by design? and something we can rely on?
[01:54:46] <Gazpacho> it's by accident
[01:54:58] <Cork> murr4y: it's by design since late 90's
[01:55:12] <Cork> all browsers do it
[01:55:31] <murr4y> ahh
[01:55:52] <Cork> i even remember the a few of the issues that introduced it
[01:56:02] <murr4y> so it's not a jquery 'hack', it's the browser that actually triggers 'click'
[01:56:07] <Cork> back then a lot of the checkboxes broke if you keyboard navigated
[01:56:21] <Cork> so they moved to triggering click from when you toggle it on a keyboard
[01:56:28] <Cork> to hangle all the broken pages
[01:56:37] <Cork> murr4y: no its a browser "hack"
[01:56:42] <Cork> and OLD one at that
[01:56:52] <murr4y> right
[01:57:00] <murr4y> cool, i don't remember that :p
[02:06:26] <Nebros> is it possible, that jquery turn on the ie9 compatibility mode?
[02:10:37] <Cork> Nebros: ie does sniffing based on what you have in the page
[02:10:47] <Cork> Nebros: set the edge header and be done with it :)
[02:12:00] <Nebros> wtf, i hate google translator -.-
[02:13:34] <Nebros> my problem is, my page always run in ie9 compatibility mode
[02:13:53] <Cork> so tell ie to never run in compatibility mode
[02:14:08] <Nebros> i dont know exactly why. but i must have old code on my page
[02:14:39] <Cork> Nebros: just set <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=Edge,chrome=1"> in the header
[02:14:44] <Nebros> i know how to tell that, but i will know why this mode turn on
[02:15:05] <Cork> Nebros: ie does that if you just look at it wrongly
[02:18:23] <seutje> so the trick is not to look?
[02:20:03] <Cork> the trick is to just tell it to sit still, and shut up
[02:20:11] <Nebros> :D
[02:20:41] <Nebros> ok, but now, i have a little proplem with the design ^^
[02:20:59] <Nebros> but it looks same like ff and chrom
[02:21:05] <Nebros> *chrome
[02:22:54] <Patrick____> Hello!!
[02:23:00] <Patrick____> I have one question
[02:23:57] <Patrick____> i have developed a little web app in python (django) and now IÂ´m trying to build the mobile app for this application using phonegap....
[02:24:32] <Patrick____> can I 'connect' my phonegap app to the python based server using jquery?? how??
[02:25:12] <Nebros> join also #django or #python they can maybe help aswell and better
[02:26:17] <aaronmcadam> Patrick____: you can call the API from a server deployed somewhere else
[02:26:24] <aaronmcadam> you can't run a server within your PG app
[02:26:37] <aaronmcadam> but you will have to proxy for local development
[02:26:52] <aaronmcadam> iOS doesn't have SOP, so you can make direct requests on the device
[02:27:36] <Patrick____> ok! thanks :)
[02:27:45] <aaronmcadam> I just use a utility method called is_device() to either hit my local sinatra proxy or make a direct request
[02:28:51] <aaronmcadam> https://github.com/aaronmcadam/sinatra-sop-proxy if anyone's interested. He's clearly not lol
[02:32:25] <skeuomorf> Hello guys, I am making an app using jquery mobile, here's the code for the app http://jsbin.com/uwuzif/1/ my problem is that when I try to dynamically add a columntoggle table on the click of #total_results_button the table is not displayed correctly at all, I've tried using trigger('create')  and table-columntoggle('refresh') and still it isn't displaying properly
[02:32:33] <skeuomorf> console shows me an error (Uncaught ReferenceError: columntoggle is not defined) so I am guessing it's because the content is loaded after the DOM is loaded, how can I solve this and get the tables to render properly?
[02:42:24] <ignavegas> hello
[02:42:44] <edoop> hello
[02:43:06] <ignavegas> what do u think about jquery 2,0?
[02:43:21] <Cork> ignavegas: what about it?
[02:43:24] <edoop> i haven't see the feauture
[02:43:30] <edoop> features.
[02:43:35] <Cork> the feature is the same as 1.9
[02:43:53] <Cork> it's meant to be the same lib, just slimmed down
[02:44:02] <Cork> (and speed up)
[02:44:05] <edoop> ok . i consider jquery as  good  support .
[02:44:20] <skeuomorf> anybody here has jquery mobile experience, I listed my problem earlier but some might not have seen it, shall I post it again?
[02:44:37] <edoop> we want know if it's supported  by another   browser
[02:44:42] <Cork> jquery 2.0 is a version of 1.9 with support for older ie removed
[02:44:56] <edoop> cork. and i.e 6
[02:45:03] <edoop> work with jquery?
[02:45:17] <Cork> ie < 9 is meant to use 1.9
[02:45:40] <Cork> ie9 and all other browsers can use 1.9 or 2.0
[02:46:07] <edoop> i want to code   a customized drag between range vertical and horizontal
[02:46:33] <edoop> using check hitarea   by coordinate
[02:47:02] <_mak> how can I pass an array in an ajax PUT request? just data: [var] should work?
[02:47:04] <edoop> and mousemove with Pointer
[02:47:45] <Cork> _marc`: $.ajax('url', { type: 'put', data: { arr: [] } });
[02:48:01] <Cork> replace [] with the array if it's a variable
[02:48:17] <_mak> ahh
[02:48:31] <_mak> Cork, it must be a json anyway...
[02:48:34] <edoop> arr: is identifier?
[02:48:39] <_mak> Cork, 'll try it
[02:48:45] <_mak> Cork, tks
[02:48:55] <Cork> arr is just a name
[02:49:03] <Cork> it can be anything that can be a key
[02:49:04] <edoop> and []  value of  passed array
[02:49:24] <Cork> _marc`: $.ajax('url', { type: 'put', data: { my_array_params_key_name: [1,2,3,4,5] } });
[02:49:40] <Cork> opps edenc: ^
[02:49:52] <edoop> yes it identifies   the arrayname passed
[02:50:06] <_mak> Cork, if my API waits for just an [1], can I pass this just or I must pass a json?
[02:50:07] <edoop> to get on url script
[02:50:10] <Cork> you don't pass an array name
[02:50:18] <edoop> $_REQUEST['arr']
[02:50:22] <Cork> _marc`: you can't pass just an array
[02:50:27] <edoop> eg: PHP
[02:50:42] <_mak> Cork, got it... tks
[02:50:58] <_marc`> Cork: You highlight the wrong one.
[02:51:11] <Cork> _marc`: lol sorry
[02:52:07] <_mak> haha
[03:07:32] <uacem> Hi there, i'm stuck on a problem, can somebody help me? my problem is as following:  I have a menu, it contains buttons, These buttons will link to other pages(Homepage/Contactpage etc). When they Click a button it should go to the page they should go to, When they are on that page the button needs to have a different color, the buttons are images so thats why i want a imageswap so the color changes if they press the button on stand on 
[03:12:50] <uacem> my problem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16187206/javascript-wont-open-link?noredirect=1#comment23142361_16187206
[03:13:05] <skinofstars> uacem: can you make the images backgrounds? then you can just change the class of the active one
[03:14:10] <uacem> skinofstars, no i can't make them background-images ..
[03:23:26] <timaaarrreee> does anyone know of a library to parse "0;32;1mThis is ANSI colour text" into styled <span> elements?
[03:23:28] <Cork> uacem: why would you need to change the image as the page unloads, sounds kinda wasteful
[03:23:49] <Krambiorix> hi, i tried opening a modal box but i just see the overlay... http://pastebin.com/SZ7UBYdq
[03:24:01] <Cork> timaaarrreee: isn't that irc colors?
[03:24:29] <deepy> They're usually seen in terminals yeah
[03:24:39] <uacem> cork: because then the person knows on which page he/she is, it's user-friendly
[03:24:41] <deepy> timaaarrreee: you could easily write one
[03:25:05] <Cork> uacem: but it will reset as soon as the link loads
[03:25:31] <uacem> Cork: yes thats right, thats why i ask you guys on how i can solve this problem?
[03:25:34] <deepy> timaaarrreee: but I'm gonna punch you in the face if you honour the Blink one
[03:25:51] <Cork> uacem: set the image server side based on the url
[03:26:15] <Cork> uacem: or if you prefer set it on load client side based on the url
[03:26:33] <uacem> Cork: im not an php expert.. im sorry, but can you give an example ?
[03:26:43] <Cork> uacem: ##php
[03:26:59] <ph88> can i get the amount of checkboxes selected in a single command or do i have to loop?     $(selector).length; // = 3 (3 checkboxes selected with this selector)    $(selector).is(':checked') // = true (the first and the last one selected, 2 out of 3) i want 2 returned instead of true
[03:27:35] <uacem> Cork: what do you mean?
[03:27:38] <Cork> ph8: $('input:checked')
[03:27:51] <Cork> uacem: i mean for php questions ask in the php channel => ##php
[03:27:56] <_mak> Cork, if the API expects an array json is there any workaround that I can use with ajax data to make it work?
[03:28:03] <uacem> Cork: ok thank you!
[03:28:24] <Cork> _mak: you might try data: JSON.stringify(array)
[03:28:34] <Cork> but no grantees it will work
[03:28:41] <Cork> as it is a broken format
[03:28:42] <ph88> thx Cork  again, hero

[03:34:32] <timaaarrreee> deepy: ermm don't think so 0-7 colours with different bold/itaic/intensity values
[03:35:17] <deepy> Might be a terminal thing then

[04:51:40] <sacho_> dokma, why do you need to serialize the form values?
[04:51:54] <dokma> sacho: to ajax post the form
[04:52:16] <sacho_> why not just collect them in an object and pass that

[05:32:21] <Krambiorix> xec, nope
[05:32:43] <xec> Krambiorix: you could look at http://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[05:32:58] <reloadz> I have 3 li tags! how can i return a number that is relative to position of clicked li tag?
[05:33:10] <Krambiorix> xec, i thought it was modal() and not dialog()
[05:33:31] <xec> Krambiorix: what's the difference?
[05:33:45] <Krambiorix> xec: $(...).dialog is not a function
[05:33:58] <xec> have you included jquery ui?
[05:35:35] <xec> there are about a million different plugins that do similar stuff, just google it. basically they just use css for positioning and style and js for show/hide
[05:36:12] <dokma> alert($('#orderRideForm').serializeArray()); alerts nothing
[05:36:24] <dokma> even though there's plenty of fields in the form
[05:36:26] <Krambiorix> xec, yes i have included
[05:37:01] <xec> Krambiorix: did you create a custom download without the dialog module perhaps?
[05:38:01] <dokma> html validates as html5 so the markup should be fine
[05:38:10] <reloadz> don't want to be rude, but can anyone take a look at my problem?
[05:38:11] <dokma> I've verified form's id
[05:38:31] <xec> ?index @ reloadz
[05:38:32] <bot-t> reloadz, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[05:38:38] <dokma> and I can pull out individual field values like: alert($('#departure').val());
[05:38:40] <reloadz> thx
[05:38:47] <dokma> which does return the text entered in it
[05:38:56] <dokma> so why would serializeArray() return nothing?
[05:38:59] <Krambiorix> xec, nope
[05:38:59] <xec> ?demo @ dokma
[05:39:00] <b-ot> dokma: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[05:39:10] <Krambiorix> xec, i'm checking if there could be a conflict or so
[05:39:11] <PREFIX> Is there any method that lets you grab keypresses in a page when a Flash control has focus? I'm guessing no
[05:41:16] <xec> PREFIX: i doubt it, but as it doesn't really have anything to do with jquery, you could try asking in a flash-specific forum, or even ##javascript
[05:41:59] <PREFIX> ye i doubt it too, Im almost considering writing an activeX/Com object just to do it >_< oh well
[05:42:44] <xec> Krambiorix: hard to tell what's wrong without seeing the issue first hand, but if it says dialog is not a function,  most likely it is not included properly
[05:43:32] <dokma> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/ds3E8/
[05:44:48] <dokma> xec: you need to click the 'NaruÄi taxi!' button
[05:45:40] <shoky> dokma: your inputs have no names
[05:45:53] <shoky> so serializeArray returns an empty array
[05:45:54] <dokma> is that mandatory?
[05:45:56] <shoky> yes
[05:46:10] <dokma> argh.... validator didn't mention that at all
[05:46:20] <shoky> it's mandatory for a form submission
[05:46:21] <dokma> it's mandatory just for serializeArray?
[05:46:24] <shoky> not for html validation..
[05:46:32] <Nebros> when ill validate the input field, the field go to the right cause the error text message "Pls note...." is at the place. what can i do when ill have the text under the input field?   http://jsfiddle.net/DFvXX/
[05:46:33] <dokma> ahhh...
[05:46:56] <anli__> Is replaceWith implying .remove or .detach?
[05:47:51] <shoky> anli__ .remove i believe
[05:48:05] <anli__> ok
[05:49:44] <xec> i would guess .detach
[05:49:46] * xec rolls dice
[05:50:53] <shoky> nah it's .remove
[05:51:42] <xec> how do you know
[05:52:44] <shoky> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.0.js  line 5274
[05:54:07] <xec> oh
[05:54:09] <shoky> or.. https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L180
[05:54:27] <xec> i thought .remove() deleted the node
[05:54:43] <shoky> that's the first part of replacing it, no>?
[05:56:16] <xec> well, it isnt really deleted, it does the same as .detach() by the looks of it
[05:56:36] <shoky> deletes the original element, puts a different one in its place
[05:56:49] <shoky> why would you need to detach() instad of remove() here?
[05:57:41] <xec> because i thought .remove() would delete the element, and .replaceWith() returns the replaced elements
[05:58:44] <xec> but .remove() apparently does the same as .detach() except .detach() retains the events etc (??)
[05:59:56] <shoky> i guess it could be useful if it detached instead of removed.. but i think in most cases people don't care about the replaced elements once they're replaced
[06:00:01] <xec> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/Pa7Rc/ "removed" isn't "deleted"
[06:01:04] <xec> so, it IS "detached"... in a sense
[06:01:04] <xec> :D
[06:02:06] <shoky> data and events are "deleted", tho :P
[06:07:38] <andrewSC> sorry
[06:09:08] <EdwardIII> hrm i'm trying to get a custom validation method that relies on data from a couple of other fields, but it looks like it's storing the results from the other fields meaning if they're invalid once they're invalid forever. something to do with scoping perhaps? https://gist.github.com/EdwardIII/1f954bcc67cbcdca5f94
[06:10:54] <d4ndy> hello
[06:12:16] <d4ndy> I'm trying to do a removeClass('#foo',5000,'swing') on a fixed header menu but it doesn't appear to work. Is it simply not possible for easing to work when switching between position:fixed to the removal of position:fixed?
[06:12:38] <d4ndy> visually there's a jump, which is what I'm trying to ease through
[06:13:14] <Krambiorix> xec, okay thanks for your help
[06:14:22] <Krambiorix> xec, actually i downloaded jquery again, and now i don't get an error but the dialog() shows only the overlay....
[06:15:52] <Krambiorix> xec, ok i solved it!
[06:26:31] <lenswipee> hey guys, where can i find a jquery refresh icon?
[06:29:14] <lenswipee> like two arrows in a circle that twiches once
[06:30:08] <shoky> lenswipee: jquery-ui has .ui-icon-refresh icon
[06:31:56] <lenswipee> shoky: i have jquery-ui setup, how does .ui-icon-refresh icon work?
[06:32:06] <Munir> Hello :D
[06:32:13] <Munir> anyone can speak German ?
[06:32:42] <Munir> anyone can speak German ?
[06:33:31] <shoky> lenswipee: <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-refresh"></span>
[06:33:37] <vinmassaro> how can i use a variable with :gt? var publications = $('.publications'); $(publications:gt(2)).slideDown(); doesn't seem to work.
[06:33:42] <lejocelyn> what do you do when you've got a function that doesn't work but you don't understand why?
[06:34:06] <lejocelyn> like one function that works perfectly fine within one context but not within another
[06:34:09] <shoky> debug it
[06:34:20] <shoky> ?ftj @ lejocelyn
[06:34:21] <bot-t> lejocelyn, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[06:34:31] <lejocelyn> thanks
[06:34:41] <Munir> anyone can speak German ?
[06:34:45] <anli__> Is there an IE way of determining the size of a file that will be uploaded with an <input type="file"/>
[06:34:57] <shoky> Munir: stop asking. this is an english speaking channel
[06:35:37] <Munir> shoky, can you help me ?
[06:35:50] <shoky> Munir: i don't know
[06:36:09] <AdamPDotty> he already tried
[06:36:24] <shoky> vinmassaro:  you can use .slice(..)
[06:37:58] <vinmassaro> shoky: i'm trying to hide list items after 3, then show/hide them with a link
[06:38:58] <shoky> vinmassaro:  publications.slice(3).slideDown();  or whatever you wanna do with them
[06:40:04] <lenswipee> how to check if my jquer-ui is loaded?
[06:41:13] <shoky> console.log( jQuery.ui.version )
[06:43:24] <lenswipee> i use ie9
[06:43:35] <lenswipee> there is no console.log is there?
[06:44:28] <xec> lenswipee: sure, but not until you open the console. so it crashes and burns. like a boss
[06:45:01] <xec> lenswipee: F12 i believe
[06:45:22] <shoky> yarp
[06:45:36] <lenswipee> and it shows up in "console" tab?
[06:45:52] <lenswipee> of f12 screen
[06:46:00] <shoky> that would be the console, yes
[06:46:08] <lenswipee> ok
[06:49:21] <lejocelyn> shoky: I don't understand this point http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide57
[06:49:35] <lejocelyn> why is foo false?
[06:50:17] <shoky> lejocelyn: it's not false
[06:50:39] <shoky> lejocelyn: but javascript reads both of those functions, before even checking if foo is true or not
[06:50:46] <thinboy> Hi guys, How can I pull specific page content from another site to my mobile site?
[06:51:10] <vinmassaro> shoky++ thanks!
[06:51:50] <xec> thinboy: is "another site" on the same domain?
[06:51:58] <lejocelyn> I didn't know that
[06:52:24] <lejocelyn> shoky: when is this behaviour interesting?
[06:53:16] <vinmassaro> using slideDown to reveal list items causes the bullets to snap in place once the transition is complete. Any way around this?
[06:53:17] <shoky> lejocelyn: it's something that's important to be aware of
[06:53:56] <ruby_on_tails> vinmassaro: got a demo ?
[06:55:19] <lejocelyn> shoky: thanks for that link, but... I still don't understand why is doesn't work :) more explaination about my problem:
[06:55:36] <lejocelyn> I've got my view in the MVC small app I develop
[06:56:04] <lejocelyn> in that view, I've got my HTML code and at the end the jquery code
[06:56:15] <vinmassaro> ruby_on_tails: hit 'run' a few times - http://jsfiddle.net/dbPQc/
[06:56:36] <lejocelyn> I've got all my <script></script> at the end of the file
[06:56:57] <tcrayford> is there a good way to debug the browser refreshing itself after I've done some other js action? We have a pretty large codebase, and I haven't found what's refreshing the page after quite a lot of reading of it so far (I've grepped for window.location, document.location, location in general and there isn't anything involving the history api). Ideally I'd like to be able to get chrome to pause a debugger just before the pa
[06:56:58] <lejocelyn> ... may be it's not the most efficient way of explaining my issue :D
[06:57:43] <momomomomo> lejocelyn: Post your code to http://gist.github.com/ (all related code and errors), and then come back and explain: What you're trying to do, what the issue is, and what you think has gone wrong. This will help people be able to digest/understand your problem. Also check this out when you get a chance: http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:58:18] <lejocelyn> momomomomo: alright
[06:58:49] <shoky> lejocelyn: better yet, post a testcase on jsfiddle or jsbin
[07:00:40] <seutje> tcrayford: onbeforeunload?
[07:01:18] <tcrayford> seutje: tried that. Dropping a "debugger" in there doesn't work in chrome in this codebase (for whatever reason)
[07:01:47] <seutje> tcrayford: oh, I would just use chrome's event listener breakpoints
[07:02:10] <seutje> but I guess that would only catch if something is performing an action on unload
[07:02:28] <maxmoore14> how secure is localStorage/sessionStorage? is it safe to store user credentials in?
[07:02:29] <tcrayford> right. This thing is *triggering* the unload, that's what I want to find
[07:03:31] <seutje> tcrayford: any hints as to when it triggers?
[07:03:32] <BillCriswell> tcrayford: I see an "originalEvent" on the event object for beforeunload... maybe that can help?
[07:04:13] <BillCriswell> Not too familiar with debugging this in particularly.
[07:04:18] <tcrayford> BillCriswell: I guess I could try "alert"ing on that
[07:05:01] <ruby_on_tails> vinmassaro: i see it slides down while loading thats the problem
[07:05:10] <tcrayford> seutje: it's a pretty complicated app :/ Like 15k lines of js and counting :/
[07:05:17] <seutje> tcrayford: this isn't just a location header being sent by PHP, is it?
[07:05:20] <a2jmrsn> tcrayford: if you're able to use console I'd recommend that over alerts unless if on a phone or IE
[07:05:23] <vinmassaro> ruby_on_tails: does the same if it's triggered from a link, hold on
[07:05:24] <seutje> like, turn off JS entirely, does it still do it?
[07:06:28] <tcrayford> seutje: this isn't even after an ajax event actually, looking at it. I'm just revealing a section of the dom and hiding another :/
[07:06:35] <tcrayford> I'll take a look though, it's an idea
[07:06:48] <vinmassaro> ruby_on_tails: here it is with a link - http://jsfiddle.net/dbPQc/1/
[07:06:53] <vinmassaro> ruby_on_tails: bullets still show up late
[07:07:03] <seutje> tcrayford: oh, so it could just be a crappy document.write?
[07:07:13] <ruby_on_tails> vinmassaro: use psuedo elements instead of bullers
[07:07:25] <tcrayford> suetje: would document.write cause the page to reload? My thing is more like $('#something').show()
[07:07:30] <vinmassaro> ruby_on_tails: can you explain?
[07:07:51] <seutje> vinmassaro: while they are being animated, they are no longer display: list-item;
[07:08:09] <ruby_on_tails> vinmassaro: ignore that
[07:08:36] <seutje> no wait, I'm tripping, it's the overflow that's causing it
[07:08:40] <ruby_on_tails> vinmassaro: wrap the ul in a div with height = first 2 LIs with overflow hidden, then on link click increase height of the div to same as height of the list
[07:09:27] <vinmassaro> ruby_on_tails: ouch, i never know how many list items there will be though
[07:09:36] <shoky> tcrayford: is there a click involved? maybe on an <a> or a form submit button..?
[07:09:52] <ruby_on_tails> vinmassaro: you could animate from height: 20px; to height: auto
[07:09:55] <ruby_on_tails> for the parent div
[07:10:12] <tcrayford> shoky: there is indeed. A click on an <a>. I return false from the click handler though, and I chased that up into jquery's source using chrome's debugger to ensure it was doing what I expected
[07:10:39] <tcrayford> after the click event has finished, that's when it reloads. But not straight after, maybe 200ms or so delay
[07:11:39] <shoky> did you try event.preventDefault()  just in cas
[07:11:40] <shoky> e
[07:12:00] <Nebros> when ill validate the input field, the field go to the right cause the error text message "Pls note...." come to the place. what can i do when ill have the error text under the input field?   http://jsfiddle.net/DFvXX/
[07:12:06] <tcrayford> shoky: I'll try it now
[07:12:23] <shoky> tcrayford: k, where 'event' is the argument to the click callback, of course
[07:12:53] <tcrayford> shoky: yeah. I'm pretty experienced, I know about these things ;). I've been tearing my hair out about this for a couple of hours now though
[07:15:06] <BillCriswell> tcrayford: How about an "Event Listener Breakpoint" for "Load"?
[07:16:30] <tcrayford> BillCriswell: won't that fire after the js has gone away though? I want to catch what's triggering the load
[07:16:40] <lenswipee> I get: SCRIPT5007: Unable to get value of the property 'version': object is null or undefined
[07:16:46] <BillCriswell> unload?
[07:16:55] <lenswipee> when i do: console.log( jQuery.ui.version )
[07:17:12] <lenswipee> is above valid syntax?
[07:17:32] <thaifood> Hi JQ peeps !
[07:17:56] <thaifood> Is there different API documentation from 1.9 to 2.0 ?   I'm wanting to get the lastest 2.0 docs
[07:18:33] <xec> thaifood: the API is the same
[07:18:54] <thaifood> sweet,  thanks so much, do i need newer UI themes for 2.0 ?
[07:18:57] <xec> thaifood: the difference is 1.9 still supports old IE
[07:19:04] <thaifood> right
[07:19:10] <thaifood> IE can die :-)
[07:19:34] <lenswipee> when i do: console.log( jQuery.ui.version )
[07:19:35] <xec> but don't confuse jquery version with jquery UI version
[07:19:37] <lenswipee> is above valid syntax?
[07:20:00] <thaifood> right
[07:22:06] <tcrayford> BillCriswell: hey, nice trick. I'm paused in an event unload breakpoint. Buuut there's no callstack of who fired the event
[07:22:07] <tcrayford> :/
[07:22:32] <BillCriswell> This is where if I knew what I was doing I'd be much more helpful.

[07:23:48] <ruby_on_tails> vinmassaro: its easy, i wouldnt waste time thinking about the list style paint timing

[07:46:08] <maxmoore14> does anyone have an opinion on the security of storing user credentials in localStorage?
[07:46:58] <Billy1> alrite.. so stupid question, I just upgraded jquery from 1.6.2 to 1.9, some dialogs are now giving a "cannot call methods on dialog prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'close'" error, when doing a "buttons: { 'Close': function() { $(this).dialog('close'); } }" in the .dialog
[07:47:04] <theresajayne_> i know its more javascript but I am having problems accessing a page scope variable within a document.ready call
[07:47:18] <Billy1> if i comment out the button code, it works fine
[07:47:30] <madprops> for some reason splice is deleting other item instead of the index i'm providing
[07:47:36] <BillCriswell> http://www.tsa.gov/tsa-pre%E2%9C%93%E2%84%A2 this url is pretty.... interesting. Check mark and a trademark symbol.
[07:48:57] <EdwardIII> arrrggh i'm confused heh

[07:49:30] <BillCriswell> madprops: Have a demo?
[07:53:02] <koichirose> Hello. I noticed that jQuery validate plugin removed metadata support. Is there a way to make it work with jQuery 2.0? See here for more info: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-validate-plugin-with-metadata-broken-after-upgrade-to-jquery-2-0-0
[07:54:41] <madprops> BillCriswell, ah nvm, I was saving the result of splice as the array for some reason
[07:55:34] <EdwardIII> is custom validation methods not the way to go if you want to say "this field is only valid if this other field contains some value?" i tried looking at depends as i thought that might be the way to go but didn't see anything

[08:00:18] <lx4r> Hello everyone, I'm having a problem with resizing an object inside a resizeable div proportional to the div with jQuery UI. My code: http://twitch.l3r.de/ (create a new stream of the channel "taketv" and try to resize it for testing). Can anybody help me?
[08:00:49] <seutje> theresajayne_: $(this) is a jQuery collection, not a DOM node, so u can't address style.backgroundColor like a property
[08:01:19] <seutje> theresajayne_: either use $(this).css('background-color', colours[code]); or the less silly this.style.backgroundColor = colours[code];
[08:01:20] <theresajayne_> its not producing more than 1 run through is it failing then and not giving me an error?
[08:01:47] <seutje> theresajayne_: like http://jsfiddle.net/bezSr/2/
[08:02:21] <theresajayne_> i got it thanks
[08:02:35] <theresajayne_> teach me to copy from examples on the web
[08:03:11] <Higdur> so... I have an asp.net page, with a file upload control
[08:03:35] <Higdur> I want to hide the control and instead trigger it by clicking at a div (that is actually styleable)
[08:03:38] <theresajayne_> seutje my final test before going for the real page http://jsfiddle.net/bezSr/4/
[08:03:50] <Higdur> this works perfect in non-IE browsers
[08:04:03] <Higdur> but not in IE, of course
[08:04:27] <BillCriswell> Should not be playing around with Colloquy stylesheets probably.
[08:04:44] <Higdur> I simply do a .click() on the file input in the click handler of the div
[08:05:55] <Higdur> in IE, the file choosing dialog shows as expected, but when I submit the page, I get no data uploaded
[08:07:50] <Higdur> anyone got experience with anything similar?
[08:15:51] <drvanon> Hello, I am working with bootstrap and want to give and remove a cssrule to body if one element has a class. The problem here is that the classes differ from time to time (modals) so I would have to call the same function every x seconds. I dislike this method, is there no other way then this?
[08:17:46] <BillCriswell> drvanon: Sadly there's no way to select a parent element in CSS.
[08:19:46] <BillCriswell> drvanon: Can't adjust it when the modals are being changed?
[08:20:26] <drvanon> How would I change a function without overwriting it?
[08:21:29] <drvanon> BillCriswell: now that I think of it, I did that.
[08:22:02] <BillCriswell> So... you're good? haha.
[08:22:04] <drvanon> I found a solution for that, but not for the fact that I had no way of noticing that the modal closed
[08:22:44] <BillCriswell> drvanon: There's a hide method.
[08:23:23] <drvanon> BillCriswell: I do not want to stop it from hiding, I want to notice when it hides
[08:24:48] <drvanon> BillCriswell: I just found the solution, there is a hide event.
[08:24:58] <BillCriswell> drvanon: That's what I was saying.
[08:26:21] <BillCriswell> $modal.on('show', function(){ /* Add body class */ }); $modal.on('hide', function(){ /* Remove body class! */ }); is what I was thinking drvanon.
[08:27:01] <drvanon> BillCriswell: Thanks for the help!
[08:27:07] <BillCriswell> drvanon: No problem.
[08:27:33] <drvanon> BillCriswell: I just noticed you wrote $modal not $('.modal'). Is this also correct?
[08:28:25] <BillCriswell> drvanon: I just did it to shorten it up. I'd typically do var $modal = $('.modal');
[08:31:03] <alfajor> hi
[08:31:57] <alfajor> I'm trying to sort some li items alphabetically. http://jsfiddle.net/2xPEu/ The problem is that I have like 3 .children-sidebar , how can I make this code http://jsfiddle.net/2xPEu/ work for each of them?
[08:34:07] <alfajor> would this work http://jsfiddle.net/2xPEu/1/ ?
[08:34:23] <EugenA> i need a tree visualizer to make structures like this: http://alturl.com/3hmqb
[08:34:32] <F1skr> alfajor: are you trying to append li's to .children-sidebar?
[08:34:54] <alfajor> mostly sorting the li's
[08:35:18] <alfajor> From a to z
[08:35:25] <BillCriswell> Do you guys pronounce the "plate" in template?
[08:36:06] <sacho> as opposed to just saying "tem"?
[08:36:11] <hlve> why can't I do something like: $('#mydiv').find('.myclass').removeClass('.myclass'); ?
[08:36:24] <BillCriswell> sacho: tem-plet vs tem-plate
[08:36:25] <t4nkd> Hey jQuery, I'm not getting click event binding like I would expect(JS lines 18..19 and 22..33) -- can someone explain what's wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/GnvT7/
[08:36:41] <sacho> hlve, probably because the elements you selected don't have a class named '.myclass'
[08:36:52] <hlve> but I do.
[08:36:53] <madprops> templade
[08:36:53] <hlve> :|
[08:36:57] <zeam> I want to add a loading icon for every ajax (.ajax/.get/.post) call I have on my site.   Is there a way to inject before and after for EVERY .jax/.post/.get ?
[08:37:09] <sacho> hlve, you've only guaranteed that they have a class named 'myclass'.
[08:37:50] * hlve shrugs
[08:37:55] <hlve> Is the code not correct?
[08:38:22] <sacho> hlve, do you see the difference in what I said?
[08:39:00] <hlve> I did. But I guess I just don't understand what's wrong with my code.
[08:39:26] <BillCriswell> t4nkd: I can't find "search-action-menu" in your HTML.
[08:39:29] <sacho> $('#mydiv').find('.myclass').removeClass('.myclass'); <-- there is no class '.myClass' to remove. There is a class 'myClass' that you may wish to remove.
[08:39:41] <sacho> pardon, myclass instead of myClass.
[08:39:41] <hlve> Oh.
[08:39:42] <t4nkd> It gets created dynamically...
[08:39:54] <t4nkd> ln53..56
[08:40:05] <t4nkd> I'm guessing that's part of my ish
[08:41:07] <BillCriswell> I'd break this down to bare bones and see if you can replicate it.
[08:41:32] <BillCriswell> Just a lot to sift through ( without my boss asking me to do it ).
[08:43:01] <t4nkd> True... can you crete an element with $('<ul/>', ...etc...) and still get on() click binding?
[08:43:06] <t4nkd> I guess that's a better question...
[08:43:20] <BillCriswell> Yes.o
[08:43:26] <t4nkd> Okay, I thought you could
[08:43:55] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/qL2W4/605/
[08:44:02] <hlve> just a quick mockup of what's going on.
[08:44:06] <BillCriswell> $('<span>Show the word "Butt"</span>').on('click', function(){ alert("Butt"); }).trigger('click');
[08:44:11] <hlve> It's adding the class on keydown, but it's not removing the other class.
[08:44:36] <alfajor> Ok, i got it to work
[08:45:05] <alfajor> but i have a small problem, maybe someone could take a look http://jsfiddle.net/2xPEu/2/ i need that words with spaces or commas, get sorted too
[08:45:06] <thaifood> Can anyone explain this ajax statement?  The callback you specify will be invoked once as a method of each of the elements in the jQuery object and will be passed three arguments to each invocation: the complete text of the loaded URL, a status code string, and the XMLHttpRequest object that was used to load the URL
[08:46:07] <hlve> nvm. figured it out.
[08:46:32] <thaifood> I don't get the "once as a method of each of the elements in the jQuery object"
[08:47:41] <clov3r> thaifood, as far as i understand, for each element in the jquery object, the callback will be executed with $(this) pointing to that element
[08:48:17] <thaifood> what are the elements in the jquery object,  the returned data or what's being passed in ?
[08:48:19] <BillCriswell> alfajor: "Sink or Swim,American Slang,The 59' Sound".split(',').sort() works.
[08:48:43] <F1skr> alfajor: I don't think you don't need the each() http://jsfiddle.net/2xPEu/4/
[08:48:51] <clov3r> well depends on your code
[08:49:11] <thaifood> i'm lost
[08:49:15] <alfajor> thanks bill and F1skr i have more ul's so i may be needing it :)
[08:49:26] <F1skr> alfajor: ah ok ;)
[08:49:30] <t4nkd> So, this is a simple example, why isn't my click event binding to .search-action-menu: http://jsfiddle.net/GnvT7/
[08:49:55] <clov3r> but if you are calling $('div.myclass').ajaxmethod([arguments], callbackfunction({});, and you have three divs with class myclass
[08:50:08] <clov3r> then the callback method will be executed for each div.myclass
[08:50:23] <clov3r> afaiu...
[08:50:42] <clov3r> but its hard to be certain without knowing the specific method you are referring to or how you are using it
[08:51:08] <Bloomberg> This is rigth?
[08:51:09] <Bloomberg> selector: '.postContDet, .detOptPost',
[08:51:09] <thaifood> ahh that seems to make sense,  thanks
[08:51:13] <alfajor> BillCriswell: Could you show me an example? looks like i'm doing it wrong
[08:51:17] <Bloomberg> what will be the better way to do it?
[08:54:11] <clov3r> t4nkd: afaics, there is no .search-action-menu
[08:54:20] <clov3r> just a .search-action-wrapper?
[08:54:32] <alfajor> Aha, I found a code and it worked http://jsfiddle.net/2xPEu/5/ could someone explain me what is going on there though?
[08:54:41] <clov3r> but as billcriswell said, that's a lot to wade through
[08:54:46] <clov3r> so maybe i'm just missing it
[08:55:32] <t4nkd> Here's a small example, sorry: http://jsfiddle.net/GnvT7/3/
[08:58:32] <clov3r> t4nkd: http://jsfiddle.net/GnvT7/4/
[08:58:53] <clov3r> nest the click handler
[08:59:02] <t4nkd> Ah, I see
[08:59:10] <t4nkd> So the element needs to exist before I can try to bind
[08:59:17] <clov3r> exactl
[08:59:18] <clov3r> y
[08:59:58] <t4nkd> Oh, that makes sense, I thought .on() was more magical than that
[09:01:27] <clov3r> even magic can't bind an event to something that does not yet exist
[09:01:35] <BillCriswell> t4nkd: If you put the click event on a parent and then check the selector you're ok.
[09:01:49] <clov3r> that's some next level causality :P
[09:03:25] <clov3r> billcriswell: how would one do that? sounds more optimal than my solution
[09:04:29] <BillCriswell> clov3r: http://jsbin.com/ozesak/1/edit like this.s
[09:06:23] <clov3r> bloomberg: that looks right, if you use $('.postContDet, .detOptPost'), will select all elements with class postContDet and all elements with class detOptPost
[09:07:15] <clov3r> BillCriswell, jsbin just hangs on a loading graphic
[09:07:39] <BillCriswell> Refresh it once or twice. It can be picky.
[09:08:21] <clov3r> yeah, won't handle menu clicks either
[09:09:17] <BillCriswell> I'm having no issue with it clov3r.
[09:09:32] <clov3r> weird
[09:09:43] <clov3r> totally non-responsive over here after 6 or 8 refreshes :P
[09:10:00] <BillCriswell> Do you have issues with other links to it?
[09:10:40] <clov3r> yep
[09:10:49] <BillCriswell> Might be a goofy plugin.
[09:10:52] <clov3r> jsbin.com in the urlbar does the same thing
[09:10:53] <BillCriswell> Try an incognito window.
[09:12:57] <clov3r> works in chrome
[09:13:08] <clov3r> and thanks
[09:13:12] <clov3r> that's great :)
[09:13:43] <clov3r> very useful
[09:13:43] <BillCriswell> what browser were you trying?
[09:13:48] <clov3r> firefox
[09:13:58] <clov3r> i've restarted it with all extensions disabled
[09:14:02] <clov3r> might be a plugin
[09:14:02] <BillCriswell> Any weird plugins?
[09:14:06] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[09:16:40] <clov3r> not a plugin either, disabled them too
[09:16:46] <BillCriswell> clov3r: It appears it might be something he's working on right now lol: https://twitter.com/rem/status/327093400476188672
[09:16:47] <b-ot> BillCriswell: @rem: Firefoxâs implementation of disabled web storage is fucked. Strong language, but simply put: you canât polyfill if itâs disabled.
[09:16:59] <clov3r> but there is for sure SOMETHING wrong with my firefox
[09:17:31] <clov3r> i get a weird css bug on one of our client websites
[09:17:55] <clov3r> that was worrying to me... but after checking it appears to be my firefox
[09:18:20] <clov3r> it was working fine, then i installed a bunch of extensions for testing...
[09:18:29] <clov3r> and now probably need to reinstall
[09:18:35] <BillCriswell> clov3r: No fun.
[09:21:39] <TheWarden> Hi
[09:22:15] <jo_> Ohai Warden.
[09:31:11] <clov3r> billcriswell: well i have web storage enabled
[09:31:42] <clov3r> but like i said, something's not right here :P
[09:31:53] <clov3r> anyway, i should probably do some work now :P
[09:32:09] <clov3r> thanks for the lesson ;)
[09:32:20] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[09:32:26] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I have to do work now too.
[09:32:29] <BillCriswell> I hate this part of my job.
[09:32:58] <TheWarden> after adding a new table row how could toggleclass() that table row?
[09:33:21] <TheWarden> or some how set the class attribute for that table row.
[09:33:35] <NoiseEee> add it when you add the row??
[09:34:34] <TheWarden> well I thought of that but not sure how. I'm using Datatables.net plugin and used fnAddData() which works great but then stuck with this dilemma.
[09:39:55] <goddard> I'm trying to append an image but it is never loaded
[09:40:04] <goddard> i have some console.logs before and after and they print just fine
[09:42:08] <madprops> goddard, jsfiddle it
[09:43:07] <goddard> i think it is some chrome caching issue
[09:43:17] <goddard> can i disable caching on a certain domain?
[09:45:10] <InvidFlower> Is it possible to change an event as it bubbles up?
[09:47:05] <InvidFlower> Nevermind.. it works. :)  Was doing something else that was silly
[09:56:35] <TheWarden> ahh I found out how, http://www.datatables.net/forums/discussion/2119/adding-row-attributes-after-fnadddata/p1.
[10:04:10] <duanemoody> I have a collection of custom filters which all use the same logic and I can't quite figure out how to make a function to just feed an array/object to $.extend($.expr[':'])
[10:04:19] <duanemoody> http://jsfiddle.net/KZudR/ sample code here
[10:05:58] <duanemoody> i haven't been here in forever so apologies if things have changed
[10:06:17] <BillCriswell> We're not allowed to ask for help in the support channel anymore.
[10:06:25] <duanemoody> uh
[10:06:27] <BillCriswell> ;)
[10:06:50] <BillCriswell> I was kidding.
[10:06:59] <BillCriswell> Doesn't work well on the internet.
[10:07:01] <duanemoody> but seriously is there something obvious i'm overlooking
[10:08:11] <duanemoody> all the docs on extending ':' presume a single case scenario
[10:08:17] <duanemoody> instead of a factory
[10:09:38] <duanemoody> is there a notation which would more cleanly pass the object names and equivalent selectors for the same function
[10:10:14] <BillCriswell> duanemoody: Trying it out now..
[10:10:23] <duanemoody> neat, thx
[10:13:15] <InvidFlower> argh.. doesn't work after all.. ugh
[10:18:55] <InvidFlower> This is such a hack..
[10:24:29] <relipse> I need a function to replace all \w+ words with firs letter capital, rest lowercase, how might I do this?
[10:24:44] <relipse> in a paragraph of words
[10:25:10] <BillCriswell> [A-Z][a-z]+\s? for a quick guess.
[10:25:46] <relipse> no i mean how do i replace all words in a paragraph with my own function, in this case it is called ucfirst
[10:25:57] <relipse> is there a regex replace callback?
[10:26:22] <utroda> Is it possible to instantiate a jquery plugin like this.. http://jsfiddle.net/ZBxcW/1/ ? any help would be great
[10:27:21] <relipse> utroda: why not?
[10:27:26] <BillCriswell> duanemoody: I came up with this.. I see them in there but I'm having no luck getting them to work when I try it. http://jsfiddle.net/KZudR/5/
[10:27:35] <BillCriswell> I'll keep messing with it but it might help out?
[10:28:02] <BillCriswell> Er: http://jsfiddle.net/KZudR/6/
[10:28:18] <utroda> well i cant figure out how too do this, its seems like you should be able to... but its crushing my brain
[10:28:31] <shwaiil> hi
[10:30:12] <shwaiil> Q: When using .ajax or any of the short methods like .get for example, if I'm getting returned HTML data, I believe I can do $( ajaxReturnData ).find('element') ? It's not working atm, but I'm sure I did this before. Any comments ? thanks!
[10:35:13] <BillCriswell> duanemoody: Let me know how that goes.. would love to know what I'm doing wrong but can't look deeply into it now.
[10:35:34] <duanemoody> checking it out
[10:35:56] <BillCriswell> I feel like it's going ot be something stupid.
[10:37:15] <BillCriswell> I tried even doing it with $.extend() like var o = {}; o[filter] = function(el){ return $(el).has(filters[filter]).length; } $.extend($.expr[':'], o); to no avail.
[10:39:39] <BillCriswell> duanemoody: Ah, wait.. it was working all along.
[10:40:35] <duanemoody> really? because when i change the css declaration to hide() it doesn't
[10:41:14] <BillCriswell> duanemoody: Hmmm..
[10:41:51] <duanemoody> and if i duplicate the img until there are 4 of them, rerunning it only logs 3 instances
[10:41:51] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/KZudR/9/ at this point I think it's something really dumb. Still can't figure it out, though.
[10:45:02] <BillCriswell> Thought it was closure related for a second...
[10:48:16] <shwaiil> when doing .get the response that is supposed to be html, have some white space that is treated as text nodes. what should I do to filter and only get, for example, the body element ? tks
[10:48:53] <shwaiil> I tried .filter(function(){ return $(this).is('body') })
[10:49:05] <shwaiil> not sure if this makes sense
[10:49:10] <drager> Any easy way to create a dropdown menu with jquery?
[10:49:58] <tw2113> css is easier
[10:50:06] <drager> I see
[10:51:39] <relipse> is there a function to cut off a paragraph at around 150 characters, and add 3 dots '...' , but also ensure that it isn't in the middle of a word, such as "The quick lazy do..." would be wrong, it instead would have to do The quick lazy..."
[10:51:53] <drager> tw2113: But I need it to appear when pressing a image
[10:52:18] <BillCriswell> duanemoody: http://jsbin.com/ulifuq/1/edit I got it working, damn closures get me every time.
[10:53:57] <tw2113> so add a class on click and make the rest css
[10:54:12] <tw2113> or use hover
[10:56:31] <drager> tw2113: on hover or click show div?
[10:58:09] <duanemoody> billcriswell, the problem is that the filters match the parent element instead of the target element
[10:58:35] <duanemoody> when you select ('div a.thumbnail') you're aiming to match the a.thumbnail, not the div
[10:58:38] <tw2113> to add a class that does the showing
[10:58:50] <BillCriswell> duanemoody: ....
[10:59:00] <duanemoody> i'll look at it, ty
[10:59:06] <tw2113> or you know .mydiv img:hover{}
[10:59:08] <tw2113> in your css
[10:59:44] <BillCriswell> duanemoody: So you want to actually select a.thumbnail img ?
[10:59:52] <BillCriswell> Not the parent that contains it?
[11:00:35] <duanemoody> i think i'm wrong
[11:00:37] <duanemoody> hold on
[11:00:39] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[11:01:08] <BillCriswell> duanemoody: Do you want it to work more like http://api.jquery.com/header-selector/ ?
[11:01:45] <duanemoody> maybe not, let me think
[11:02:01] <duanemoody> someone in the room is blowing her nose every 30 seconds and my concentration's busted
[11:03:06] <BillCriswell> If you want the actual element $(filters.upload).css('color', 'red'); could do it without all the : stuffs.
[11:07:35] <duanemoody> works like a charm, billcriswell
[11:07:37] <duanemoody> thanks
[11:07:49] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[11:27:37] <utroda> Anyone know how to achieve this? http://jsfiddle.net/ZBxcW/1/

[11:43:47] <khmer> only firing
[11:43:48] <khmer> on click
[11:43:52] <khmer> i am losing my M I N D
[11:43:58] <BillCriswell> khmer: Hard to know without the code in front of us.
[11:44:03] <khmer> i know
[11:44:20] <khmer> code's under NDA, i haven't tried to fiddle up a sanitized version yet
[11:44:22] <khmer> i mean i will
[11:44:28] <BillCriswell> thesisb: The distance traveled in a "scroll" event?
[11:44:40] <BillCriswell> khmer: You'll probably figure out the issue when you do that.
[11:44:53] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ khmer
[11:45:02] <khmer> oh man please detect my frustration and can the condescention you guys
[11:45:06] <sacho> which happens to be the biggest reason why people ask for test cases. :)
[11:45:10] <diamonds> where is the page for the constructor $()
[11:45:23] <sacho> diamonds, see jquery
[11:45:31] <BillCriswell> sacho: mmm hmm. =)
[11:45:36] <diamonds> ah I was searching "constructor" :p
[11:45:37] <thesisb> BillCriswell: yes
[11:45:55] <sacho> diamonds, $ is an alias to jQuery, so you're simply calling jQuery()
[11:46:08] <diamonds> sacho: yes, thank you!
[11:46:46] <rounce> HII
[11:46:53] <jo_> Ohai.
[11:47:00] <rounce> Does anyone have a contact for whoever is in charge of the jquery npm module
[11:47:37] <rounce> it's just that I need to tell them to go fuck themselves
[11:47:55] <jo_> https://npmjs.org/~rwaldron
[11:48:08] <rounce> err
[11:48:08] <rounce> no
[11:48:14] <rounce> wrong jquery
[11:48:14] <jo_> No?
[11:48:27] <rounce> https://npmjs.org/package/jquery
[11:48:28] <jo_> Oh.
[11:48:40] <rounce> there's an NPM profile called 'jquery\
[11:49:08] <rounce> sure the repo is on his GH account
[11:49:23] <rounce> but there could be more than one person managing it
[11:49:41] <jo_> I see.
[11:49:49] <rounce> either way
[11:49:58] <rounce> it doesn't work on windows without insane amounts of pain
[11:50:01] <BillCriswell> thesisb: http://jsbin.com/ajocud/1/edit I'd use this, and just calculate the different between the previous and next values.
[11:50:04] <jo_> So you don't want his contact info, you want broad spectrum contact info not listen on the NPM page?
[11:50:20] <rounce> well if he's the main dude looking after that repo
[11:50:24] <rounce> I'll go after him
[11:50:28] <jo_> He's the one listed on the repo page.
[11:50:34] <rounce> was looking to confirm it wasn't someone else before I send some abrasive emails
[11:50:41] <jo_> He's listed as the maintainer.  Perhaps it's not him.
[11:50:43] <BillCriswell> thesisb: I used this: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[11:51:05] <vacho> 	function show_alert(message, type, location = 'main')
[11:51:05] <vacho> can I do that in JS?
[11:51:07] <fission6> how do i apply select2 to all multiple selects, i.e., ow do i select all multiple select dom elements
[11:51:10] <thesisb> BillCriswell: Good idea re:using debounce.
[11:51:15] <rounce> BillCriswell, you know you can implement debounce/throttle functions in about 5 lines each
[11:51:28] <thesisb> Yet still there is no clean method to find scrollStop distance? I have to do a substraction right?
[11:51:31] <BillCriswell> rounce: True. I didn't feel like writing it though.
[11:51:35] <rounce> and not have jquery as a dep
[11:51:57] <BillCriswell> That doesn't require jQuery.
[11:52:00] <khmer> ok i think it was chrome itself
[11:52:19] <rounce> BillCriswell: really?
[11:52:29] <BillCriswell> "jQuery isnât actually required for this plugin, because nothing internal uses any jQuery methods or properties. jQuery is just used as a namespace under which these methods can exist."
[11:52:38] <vacho> ajpiano:
[11:52:42] <rounce> yeah
[11:52:50] <rounce> but it still wants to fuck with your dollah
[11:54:34] <BillCriswell> I don't mind.
[11:55:36] <vacho> function show_alert(message, type, location = 'main') { ... }
[11:55:40] <vacho> is that legal JAVSCRIPT?
[11:56:02] <jo_> Don't think so.
[11:56:17] <BillCriswell> Hm.
[11:56:24] <jo_> Nope.
[11:56:30] <vacho> how would I do that in JS then?
[11:56:38] <jo_> Can't specify a default type in JS.
[11:56:40] <vacho> I want a function I can call with either 2 or 3 params.
[11:56:52] <jo_> You can call a function with fewer args.
[11:57:01] <jo_> function show_alert(message, type, location) {}
[11:57:02] <BillCriswell> just drop the = 'main'
[11:57:15] <vacho> ok
[11:57:25] <jo_> Then inside show_alert(message, type, location) { if(location === undefined) { location = 'main'; } }
[11:57:26] <vacho> can I still call it with two params?
[11:57:27] <BillCriswell> var location = location || 'main'
[11:57:37] <jo_> Even better.
[11:57:40] <jo_> Yes.
[11:57:57] <jo_> show_alert('foo', 'bez') == show_alert('foo', 'bez', undefined)
[11:58:16] <jo_> Use Bill's trick for assigning location.
[12:00:26] <BillCriswell> Just know browsers have location defined already, so that could cause some headaches if you're not careful.
[12:04:28] <khmer> ok so
[12:04:37] <khmer> mouse events stopped working in my chrome. ALL mouse events
[12:04:47] <sacho> vacho, that's certainly possible.
[12:04:48] <khmer> i just tried this in five other browsers including another instance of chrome
[12:05:31] <happyface> how do I get complete (or .always) to trigger if I have a 403 error?
[12:05:55] <BillCriswell> khmer: restart chrome?
[12:06:25] <NoiseEee> happyface: it should fire automatically?
[12:06:28] <sacho> vacho, http://jsfiddle.net/5FLVy/
[12:06:42] <khmer> restarted chrome, disabled all extensions, wiped cookies and cache
[12:06:48] <khmer> am now in the process of deleting my chrome profile
[12:06:54] <khmer> this is the strangest thing that has ever happened to me
[12:07:05] <BillCriswell> khmer: Restart your computer maybe?
[12:07:08] <khmer> mouse events clearly still work, they just don't happen in the web inspector
[12:07:15] <khmer> BillCriswell: yeah i've done that too
[12:07:29] <happyface> NoiseEee: except it isn't, neither is error:
[12:07:38] <vacho> sacho: dfq is that????
[12:09:15] <sacho> vacho, it's what you asked, calling a 3-parameter function with 2 parameters and one default
[12:09:42] <vacho> that code is to advanced for me sorry
[12:14:37] <BillCriswell> vacho: http://jsbin.com/etokag/1/edit
[12:16:49] <khmer> my chrome literally only fires mouseovers when i click
[12:16:52] <khmer> this is insane
[12:17:46] <sacho> on any page?
[12:17:51] <khmer> on any page
[12:17:58] <khmer> i'm wiping my profile, wish me luck i guess
[12:18:13] <happyface> khmer: incognito first...
[12:18:21] <happyface> or get canary
[12:18:25] <khmer> got canary
[12:18:29] <khmer> need release chrome for UA testing
[12:18:30] <BillCriswell> khmer: are you stopped propagation?
[12:18:37] <BillCriswell> stopping*
[12:18:43] <khmer> BillCriswell, read up, this happens on every page
[12:18:48] <khmer> i should probably be asking the question in #chrome
[12:20:04] <sacho> probably
[12:20:58] <khmer> wiping my profile fixed it
[12:21:03] <khmer> wow you guys
[12:21:06] <khmer> that was a crazy adventure
[12:27:20] <ezakimak> seeing strange behavior with 2 sortables + connectWith. when the a new item is dragged over the drop sortable, *even below the last item*, the first time it, opens up space *above* the last item. if you drag it back out and back in, even over the same exact spot, it will then close that space and let you drop it below all. or, if you drag it above the bottom item and back down it will also close that space and let you drop it below
[12:28:42] <kaylee> so if I've got $.ajaxSetup({dataType: "json"}) set, should I need to run .parseJSON() on the response? or should it automatically handle that?
[12:29:32] <ezakimak> your response will already be js
[12:30:47] <kaylee> that's what I thought
[12:30:49] <alfajor> sup guys
[12:30:52] <kaylee> that means something else is wonky
[12:31:04] <NoiseEee> kaylee: sending back json headers?
[12:31:41] <alfajor> I've set up a small test gallery here http://jsfiddle.net/eXAcc/ could anyone point me out on how to make the next and previous buttons work with my gallery?

[12:35:58] <Shad0wByte> yo
[12:36:42] <alfajor> any ideas on where to start?
[12:38:53] <Shad0wByte> Anyone, know Ajax?
[12:39:03] <Shad0wByte> Ajax channel is kind of blank
[12:40:12] <snover> no, nobody uses ajax anymore, itâs like fortran
[12:40:29] <ezakimak> json ftw
[12:43:12] <wer0ckz> Hi. Help please. How can I drag the dialog box? Here is my source:  http://jsfiddle.net/sNuUN/  - Thanks
[12:44:14] <happyface> Shad0wByte don't ask to ask, just ask
[12:44:46] <BillCriswell> Shad0wByte: My mother is quite handy with AJAX.
[12:44:49] <sacho> wer0ckz, http://jsfiddle.net/sNuUN/2/

[12:57:07] <bluescreenX> hi, is there a possibility to place a callback before pagechange. i want to check if a user is logged in redirect to login page. but first the account page is loaded before the redirect
[13:02:19] <bluescreenX> pagebeforechange is called twice. i just need some callback "before page open"
[13:05:38] <NoiseEee> bluescreenX: that should be taken care of by your backend
[13:06:15] <NoiseEee> bluescreenX: where the *backend* directs someone to the login page if they're not logged in.  that happens on each 'protected' page
[13:06:40] <bluescreenX> no i'm working on the frontend in jqm
[13:07:02] <NoiseEee> bluescreenX: i hear you, but frontend has nothing to do with checking if someone is logged in
[13:07:11] <NoiseEee> because if it is doing that, it can be spoofed/fooled
[13:07:44] <NoiseEee> so what i'm saying is, 'rethink approach'
[13:10:36] <bluescreenX> NoiseEee, http://nopaste.info/985d1e414e.html
[13:11:15] <bluescreenX> i tried different callbacks but the page is always loaded before the changePage
[13:11:52] <bluescreenX> maybe there is some preventDefault()
[13:11:56] <NoiseEee> hmm, sorry don't use jqm. but shouldn't you be using 'on' instead of 'bind'?
[13:12:16] <bluescreenX> whats the difference?
[13:13:47] <bluescreenX> or is there someway to cancel the changepage event
[13:14:28] <`RobW> don't use bind, that's the difference
[13:14:33] <`RobW> :D
[13:15:55] <`RobW> $(el).live('pagebeforehide', function(e, ui) { e.preventDefault(); alert('FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO'); });
[13:21:07] <bluescreenX> Object [object Object] has no method 'live'
[13:21:35] <drager> bluescreenX: use .on instead of .live
[13:21:45] <drager> bluescreenX: .live() is deprecated
[13:22:01] <EugenA> do you know any plugins to convert nested <li> list to somethink like this http://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0921800912000845-gr10.jpg
[13:22:02] <bluescreenX> hmm but its still opening the page
[13:22:03] <noregret> I got #('.items').click(..) how can I know the index of the current item ?
[13:22:20] <`RobW> oops, i did mean on()
[13:22:40] <drager> `RobW: Ah you're the bad guy
[13:22:43] <drager> ;)
[13:22:45] <bluescreenX> i need this "when account page is opened and there is no session user in localStorage stored it should directly redirect to login page"
[13:23:50] <bluescreenX> unfortunately the account page is always loaded and then it redirects to the login
[13:24:24] <bluescreenX> it should cancel the old pagechange event and go to login
[13:25:17] <NoiseEee> bluescreenX: try .on() instead of bind, and put it on the div "page" being unloaded, not "document"
[13:25:29] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquerymobile.com/pagebeforehide/
[13:25:40] <NoiseEee> iirc events don't bubble up to document on iOS
[13:26:14] <wer0ckz> Hi. Please help about draggable(). How can i create a draggable function for all "div.appriseOuter" ? Please see my source: http://jsfiddle.net/sNuUN/3/  - This case I created two $('div.appriseOuter').draggable();
[13:27:16] <bluescreenX> i tried this
[13:27:18] <wer0ckz> So that i don't have to enter   $('div.appriseOuter').draggable(); for each apprise that i need to be draggable
[13:27:33] <bluescreenX> $('#account').on('pagebeforeshow', function(e, ui) { e.preventDefault();  $.mobile.changePage('#login');});
[13:28:01] <bluescreenX> but stil its showing the account page before redirecting
[13:28:57] <bluescreenX> the e.preventDefault has no effect :(
[13:34:05] <wer0ckz> help pls
[13:35:00] <Joel> does anyone know of a feature in jquery, or a plugin, where I can do things like Date.yesterday and specify a format? things of that nature, trying to get today, yesterday, last week begining/end of week, last month (begin/end) last year (begin/end). etc.
[13:36:29] <sacho> date.js?
[13:37:30] <fncomp> Joel: We're using Moment.js http://momentjs.com/ it's not a plugin, but I don't think that's a bad thing.
[13:37:32] <Joel> sacho: that's not a plugin to jquery, I'm usign it now, but hasn't had a release in forever, wasn't sure if there was something newer/better
[13:38:56] <didiergm> BlueScreenX in my experience, the pageBeforeSHow event is not the right one to use
[13:39:13] <didiergm> BlueScreenX I assume you're using JQM 1.3 right ?
[13:40:06] <jaequery> any jquery freelancers available for hire?
[13:40:09] <didiergm> bluescreenx ??
[13:41:09] <dcholth> Hello, can I ask jQuery UI questions here?
[13:41:14] <didiergm> yep
[13:41:36] <dcholth> I'm having some trouble figuring out what exactly 'duration' means in effects.
[13:41:50] <dcholth> I'm doing $( ".progressSpan" ).effect( 'slide', {}, 5000), hoping it would be 5 seconds... but it seems like its waiting 5 seconds before animating
[13:41:57] <didiergm> bluescreenX : when you read this, use  $(document).on ('pagebeforechange', event instead
[13:41:59] <dcholth> Then it just *SNAPS* to the finished effect.
[13:42:31] <wer0ckz> help again please. Sorry i got disconnected many times. Please help about draggable(). How can i create a draggable function for all "div.appriseOuter" ? Please see my source: http://jsfiddle.net/sNuUN/3/  - This case I created two $('div.appriseOuter').draggable();
[13:42:31] <dcholth> I had similar results when trying $().animate( {left: 50px}, 5000 ) // or something similar
[13:42:51] <wer0ckz> thanks again sacho
[13:42:57] <didiergm> bluescreenX beware it is fired twice one with page as a string (the ID) this is were you redirect , cancel etc and once with page as a jquery object
[13:44:54] <sifi> question, is it possible to do something like this $('#blah input[name!=undefined]')
[13:45:06] <sifi> if so I can't get it to work.
[13:45:08] <Joel> sacho: http://jsfiddle.net/E6gqK/ - would love to know why it calculates out this way
[13:46:23] <dcholth> Thoughts?
[13:47:02] <didiergm> sifi I guess you have to do an .each loop ojn #blah input and test whether the attr('name') is undefined
[13:47:47] <didiergm> dcholth none, sorry
[13:48:09] <bluescreenX> ok now i have this solution
[13:48:10] <bluescreenX> $(document).on('pagebeforechange', function(e, data) {
[13:48:10] <bluescreenX>     if(typeof data.toPage == 'string' && data.toPage.match(/#account/)){ e.preventDefault();  $.mobile.changePage('#login'); }
[13:48:10] <bluescreenX> });
[13:48:12] <sifi> didiergm: good idea
[13:48:36] <bluescreenX> it seems only the pagebeforechange can be cancelled by prevendefault
[13:49:00] <didiergm> bluescreenX that what I said earlier - only way
[13:58:09] <Joel> fncomp: thanks, much better than that date.js
[14:01:33] <fncomp> Joel: np, enjoy
[14:01:59] <Joel> fncomp: don't know if you saw my js fiddle, but that stuff is fubar. http://jsfiddle.net/E6gqK/
[14:04:16] <fncomp> Joel: That it's still on Google Code is a somewhat bad sign...
[14:04:31] <Joel> fncomp: right? :P
[14:11:42] <jbwiv> guys, I have a jquery dialog widget. I'd really like to give my user the ability to either use the contents of that as a widget, or to open them in a separate window. anyone know if a) this is possible with the default jquery libs or b) if there's a plugin out there which accomplishes it?
[14:17:40] <Xal_> What is the easiest way to do gradients in jquery?
[14:19:35] <BillCriswell> Xal_: with CSS.
[14:20:18] <Xal_> how about animating gradients
[14:22:34] <Xal_> Here's the issue. I have a button that needs to animate down on the rollover (which it is), but also needs to have shadows move in on the right and left edge.
[14:22:38] <alainus> I'd like to get all the elements that DON'T have the substring attribute value "string", but do have the attribute "attribute". In other words, the exact opposite of $('[attribute*="string"]');. Any suggestions ? Maybe I can extract the matching ones like this: $('[attribute]').remove($('[attribute*="string"]')); with some "remove" function, or similar.
[14:23:10] <BillCriswell> Xal_: You can use box-shadow for that?
[14:23:35] <Xal_> right and left, not top and bottom.
[14:23:56] <BillCriswell> That's fine. Box shadow can do that.
[14:24:04] <Xal_> It can? How?
[14:24:18] <Xal_> I was looking at box-shadow
[14:24:29] <BillCriswell> http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/base-css.html#buttons has some really buttony looking buttons.
[14:24:44] <BillCriswell> alainus: Youc an just do $('[attribute*="string"]').remove();
[14:25:27] <BillCriswell> Xal_: I'd just borrow some of that CSS.
[14:25:47] <alainus> BillCriswell, Uhm, but that will remove the ones I don't like to target. I'd like to target the ones that don't have that substring. In other words: $('[attribute!*="string"]'); (If that existed)
[14:26:19] <BillCriswell> Ahhh, You can use .filter().
[14:26:27] <Xal_> box-shadow is only mentioned once on that whole page, and that's for form control states.
[14:27:13] <BillCriswell> box-shadow can be used inside the element and you can do it that way, but this way is already pretty close.
[14:27:59] <BillCriswell> alainus: It would be like...  $('[attribute]').filter(){ return !/string/.test(this.name); }).remove();
[14:28:53] <Xal_> I thought the box shadow was always the same size as the element
[14:29:14] <BillCriswell> Xal_: It's adjustable on x and y axis.
[14:29:57] <Xal_> the position is. You can change the distance but the aspect ratio stays the same
[14:30:17] <BillCriswell> Xal_: I just may not be getting what you're asking for.
[14:30:20] <alainus> BillCriswell, and can I just do a $('[attribute]').each(); and inside, do a conditional, to ask: if $(this).attr('attribute').containsSubstring("mystring") { ... } else { ... } ?? What could "containsSubstring" be?
[14:30:38] <Xal_> I need shadows on the right AND left, not right OR left.
[14:30:55] <stygyan> hello
[14:30:55] <BillCriswell> With this method you could do: $('[attribute]').filter(){ return !/string/.test(this.name); }).each()
[14:31:39] <BillCriswell> Xal_: You can have more than one box-shadow, just separate by ,.
[14:31:47] <Xal_> Oh!
[14:32:04] <alainus> BillCriswell, but in the other method ?
[14:32:35] <BillCriswell> alainus: You can do that, just use indexOf()
[14:32:46] <BillCriswell> $(this).attr('attribute').indexOf('string') > -1
[14:33:03] <alainus> BillCriswell, isn't indexOf not supported by all browsers?
[14:33:21] <BillCriswell> alainus: It's not supposed on arrays in all browsers. On strings it's cool.
[14:33:29] <chovy> i want to write a plugin that returns a value.
[14:33:33] <alainus> ok, thanks =)
[14:33:41] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[14:33:41] <chovy> how do i structure this signature of the return statement?
[14:34:43] <dcholth> Figured out the problem... I had transition durations set in my CSS, which trumped JQuerys animation durations

[14:51:10] <MrWax> Hello. Someone in here uses turn.js?
[15:02:42] <wer0ckz> Hi Guys. Help please. How can I disable the Enter keyboard? It skips the dialog box or return - http://jsfiddle.net/sNuUN/3/
[15:11:56] <reaktivo> Hi everyone
[15:12:21] <reaktivo> I'm trying to implement a jquery plugin that makes use of Promises but returns the jQuery object
[15:12:32] <reaktivo> the same way $.animate works
[15:13:01] <reaktivo> in the sense that you can call $('elementId').animate(props).promise() to get a promise back after animation is complete
[15:13:08] <reaktivo> I can't find any documentation on it
[15:13:35] <reaktivo> except this note "The returned Promise is linked to a Deferred object stored on the .data()"
[15:13:44] <reaktivo> on jQuery's api site
[15:25:41] <wer0ckz> Help please. http://jsfiddle.net/sNuUN/2/ <- Enter key only works the first time you hit Enter. The next you hit enter, it skips
[15:30:46] <reaktivo> :(
[15:32:18] <GeneralMayhem> wer0ckz: what is the enter key supposed to be doing? I'm seeing a grey box that says "click me"
[15:32:44] <wer0ckz> please click "click me" first then it opens the dialog box
[15:32:50] <wer0ckz> then try to hit enter
[15:33:11] <GeneralMayhem> wer0ckz: click the box, then enter closes the dialog
[15:33:15] <GeneralMayhem> wer0ckz: i see no problems
[15:33:57] <GeneralMayhem> wer0ckz: chromium 25/ubuntu 12.04, for reference
[15:34:44] <wer0ckz> it should open the 3rd dialog box
[15:35:10] <wer0ckz> when you hit enter, it opens 1st and 2nd dialog box only not the 3rd
[15:35:42] <GeneralMayhem> wer0ckz: i'm sorry, i don't know what "the third dialog box" is
[15:36:43] <wer0ckz> try not to hit enter, use the mouse and click ok
[15:36:46] <wer0ckz> it should be that way
[15:36:49] <wer0ckz> sorry for the confusion
[15:37:19] <GeneralMayhem> wer0ckz: same effect
[15:37:34] <GeneralMayhem> wer0ckz: which is what's in the code; the handler for the enter key just delegates to the click handler for the ok button
[15:37:59] <GeneralMayhem> wer0ckz: i'm not seeing anything in this code that could possibly do anything other than what it's doing right now; what exactly do you want out of it?
[15:38:26] <wer0ckz> the enter key should process the ok button
[15:43:00] <wer0ckz> Help please - How can i put the function $('div.appriseOuter').draggable(); for all 'apprise' functions?  http://jsfiddle.net/sNuUN/4/ <- i need to put the on each apprise function
[15:45:39] <Krambiorix> hi, when typing a user 's name to send a message to in facebook, there is a suggestion list shown... How can i make something like that facebook thingy?
[15:58:51] <wer0ckz> Hi. Help please about draggable() http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16203639/jquery-draggable-to-all-apprise-function
[15:59:12] <MrWax> Hello. Someone in here uses turn.js?
[16:09:08] <wer0ckz> How can i put the function $('div.appriseOuter').draggable(); for all 'apprise' functions? i need to put the on each apprise function. Is it possible to declare it as one function ? http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/sNuUN/6/
[16:12:45] <kanzie> Im loading json data from a backend but sometimes I get NaN back as value, the .ajax() parsing fails as it expects 'NaN' instead of NaN. Is there any way I can pre-parse the string so I can correct this as I can't access the backend?
[16:16:03] <shoky> kanzie: you can use dataType: 'text', and then $.parseJSON()  the result if you see that it's JSON, i guess.
[16:16:47] <kanzie> so I take it as text, do a string replace and run parseJSON on it?
[16:18:14] <shoky> kanzie: as long as what you run parseJSON on is JSON.  ( 'NaN' is not JSON )
[16:18:52] <shoky> "NaN" is
[16:28:32] <MrWax> http://www.turnjs.com - has anybody used this before?
[16:39:45] <Shad0wByte> Hey
[16:40:27] <Shad0wByte> $.get("ip.php", { #sIN: $('#input1').val() }, function(response) {  <-- Should this  not fill in data to the sIN <input>
[16:41:07] <ezakimak> # is a comment character, so #sIN.... is all not seen by the js engine
[16:41:41] <ezakimak> hrm. maybe not anymore
[16:42:00] <Shad0wByte> jQuery uses CSS Selectors doesn't it?
[16:42:07] <Shad0wByte> #sIN is a div
[16:42:10] <Shad0wByte> id*
[16:42:29] <tw2113> the way you're doing it looks like you're trying to pass in a json object but the # would invalidate that
[16:42:53] <ezakimak> #sIN is invalid js at any rate
[16:43:01] <ezakimak> you can quote it
[16:43:55] <Shad0wByte> I did
[16:43:58] <Shad0wByte> It didn't work just crashed it :S
[16:46:00] <Shad0wByte> I have an <input type = "text" id = "sIN" /> on the ip.php page that I'm trying to pass val() too.
[16:46:25] <tw2113> wouldn't you need $.post() for that?
[16:46:34] <tw2113> if you're trying to pass data into a different location
[16:48:40] <Shad0wByte> Hmm maybe
[16:48:54] <Shad0wByte> maybe I need a $.post inside a $.get
[16:49:37] <tw2113> huh
[16:50:29] <Shad0wByte> I'm confused lol
[16:50:50] <tw2113> you're trying to send some data elsewhere
[16:50:58] <tw2113> that's a POST request
[16:51:17] <tw2113> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[16:52:18] <Shad0wByte> I'm already there
[16:52:20] <Shad0wByte> already tried post
[16:52:22] <Shad0wByte> does the same thing
[16:52:34] <Shad0wByte> :S
[16:52:38] <tw2113> well from everything i've seen, $.get is wrong
[16:52:47] <tw2113> that's simply requesting data
[16:56:39] <Shad0wByte> I am using a $.post now
[16:56:42] <Shad0wByte> It's still not sending data
[16:58:38] <tw2113> i stand by my thoughts that the data you're trying to send is not done right and thus causing issues
[16:58:50] <shoky> Shad0wByte: to put that value in #sIN you'd do:  $('#sIN').val( $('#input1').val() );
[17:00:37] <shoky> Shad0wByte: or maybe you want:  $.get("ip.php", { 'sIN': $('#input1').val() }, function(response) { $('#sIN').val( response ); });
[17:00:42] <shoky> you're not being too clear about it..
[17:00:50] <Shad0wByte> Sorry
[17:01:43] <shoky> er my last example doesn tmake much sense i guess.. just explain what you want happening
[17:03:57] <Shad0wByte> Ok, I created a input output with jQuery
[17:04:12] <Shad0wByte> I need to send the input to ip.php, and return the result
[17:04:22] <Shad0wByte> The result depends on the input
[17:27:46] <ezakimak> you need to know what ip.php is expecting
[17:30:30] <tw2113> are you grabbing the data out of the $_POST global?
[17:32:51] <Shad0wByte> nah
[17:32:58] <Shad0wByte> I'll post the code for you guys ok
[17:33:40] <Shad0wByte> http://mysticpaste.com/view/uhzIHnDO5T?5
[17:33:44] <Shad0wByte> That's the jQuery
[17:33:50] <Shad0wByte> for game.php
[17:34:31] <tw2113> so you have a $.post inside a $.submit
[17:34:39] <Shad0wByte> http://mysticpaste.com/view/2NI7vd7oJV?8
[17:34:44] <Shad0wByte> That is ip.php
[17:35:01] <Shad0wByte> Yes, the $.post only exec when the ping IP is executed
[17:36:11] <Shad0wByte> damn it tw2113 xD
[17:44:19] <binaryfus10nz> any ideas what http://www.jwt.com/ is built on?
[17:46:02] <Shad0wByte> good code
[17:46:11] <Shad0wByte> Looks like a bit of everything XD I can see jQuery, Ajax, etc
[17:47:17] <blindMoe> binaryfus10nz: looks like a custom site that incorporates jquery masonry or isotope
[17:48:08] <binaryfus10nz> ya these guys know what they are doing
[17:48:20] <blindMoe> how do sites do that where it looks like the page is being refreshed via ajax but the url changes
[17:48:25] <blindMoe> github does that as well
[17:49:17] <binaryfus10nz> I actually was going through and it looks like its made on adobe catalyst
[17:49:52] <PAGO> I have got a question. I've got some code here which works. but How do I say that the lyrics or not shown at the beginning and appear only on click?   http://jsfiddle.net/eUTbn/15/
[17:51:19] <Shad0wByte> $('a').click(function() {
[17:51:20] <Shad0wByte>     $(".song_title").click(function() {
[17:51:20] <Shad0wByte>         $(".lyrics #lyrics1:not(#"+$(this).attr("id")+")").hide();
[17:51:20] <Shad0wByte>     });
[17:51:20] <Shad0wByte> });
[17:51:21] <Shad0wByte> Try this
[17:51:51] <blindMoe> eww.. pastebin exists for a reason
[17:52:12] <Shad0wByte> sorry
[17:52:48] <PREFIX> is there any relevant differences between using type.ID vs #ID  as in $('div.MyDivID') vs $('#MyDivID') ?
[17:53:19] <blindMoe> not really.. unless it is needed
[17:53:58] <systemfault> PREFIX: They're all different things
[17:54:38] <systemfault> div#MyDivID vs #MyDivID ?
[17:54:39] <PAGO> shadow it doesnt work
[17:57:28] <PAGO> I have got a question. I've got some code here which works. but How do I say that the lyrics ("lyric nummer 1" and "lyric nummer 2") are not shown at the beginning and appear only on click?   http://jsfiddle.net/eUTbn/15/
[18:01:40] <PAGO> I have got a question. I've got some code here which works. but How do I say that the lyrics ("lyric nummer 1" and "lyric nummer 2") are not shown at the beginning and appear only on click?   http://jsfiddle.net/eUTbn/20/

[18:26:42] <Ilhami> Hey anybody here?
[18:27:04] <Dexx1_> Ilhami: I am ..but I am a noobster
[18:27:13] <Randomage> next('div p') won't hit anything Dexx1_
[18:27:22] <Dexx1_> hmm

[18:27:31] <Ilhami> what does this mean ?
[18:27:44] <Shad0wByte> Dexx, what are you wanting again?
[18:27:54] <Shad0wByte> You can use the .toggle( ) for a hide/show effect on link
[18:28:06] <Randomage> jqueryc.com doesn't sound right.
[18:28:18] <Memolition> Dexx1_: what do exactly you ned
[18:28:33] <Ilhami> Randomage what sounds right then ?
[18:28:50] <Memolition> need
[18:29:16] <Dexx1_> Memolition: Shad0wByte what I am trying to do is have the "Login" box on the upper right hand corner "collapse" (ie: show and hide) upon clicking it, ie: When the user clicks on the âLoginâ text, the login form slides down
[18:31:02] <Randomage> http://jsfiddle.net/WnZnE/1/
[18:31:38] <Ilhami> Randomage???
[18:31:52] <Randomage> Ilhami, I have no idea what you're trying to do.
[18:32:05] <Ilhami> I get this error
[18:32:10] <Ilhami> how would I fix it?
[18:32:20] <Randomage> I have no context to work from.
[18:32:28] <Ilhami> you want FTP info ?
[18:32:45] <Randomage> nah I'm going to sleep anyway.
[18:32:48] <Randomage> good luck.
[18:33:00] <Ilhami> Who can I ask? Who is the best at jquery in here?
[18:34:37] <shoky> Ilhami: what's your question? "what does this mean"?
[18:34:50] <Ilhami> how can I fix the error above?
[18:34:51] <shoky> it's not even jquery
[18:36:40] <shoky> it doesn't look like an error really..
[18:36:50] <shoky> just a bunch of code
[18:37:27] <Ilhami> ok where do I find this code?
[18:37:29] <shoky> if some site is giving you that instead of what you want, then you need to ask the site owner/developer.. not here
[18:37:46] <shoky> i mean, what you pasted is a bunch of code.. you found it.
[18:37:53] <Dexx1_> Randomage: thanks ;)
[18:38:00] <Ilhami> it shows on my site
[18:38:06] <Ilhami> :S
[18:38:09] <Ilhami> wordpress site
[18:38:21] <Ilhami> after adding a theme
[18:38:36] <shoky> Ilhami: then ask  in the wordpress channel, not here
[18:38:38] <Randomage> If I can be completely honest
[18:38:42] <Randomage> don't use that theme
[18:38:53] <Ilhami> why not?
[18:39:01] <Randomage> I visited jqueryc.com and my antivirus alerted me hard.
[18:39:15] <shoky> ;S
[18:39:29] <Ilhami> LOOOOOL I also visited it but got no alert
[18:39:30] <Randomage> That theme might be broken, malicious, or whatever.
[18:39:40] <Randomage> it might be a false positive
[18:40:09] <Randomage> but it's still a theme with broken code in it, it's bound to get messy, sooner or later.
[18:40:13] <Randomage> just my 2 cents.
[18:40:26] <Ilhami> I deleted it
[18:40:30] <Ilhami> can you find me a theme?
[18:40:50] <Randomage> I really can't man, picking a theme takes time and knowledge about what you're doing. :)
[18:41:10] <Randomage> I need to get some sleep and/or work on stuff to pay my bills, sorry pal.
[18:41:36] <Ilhami> I will pay your bills...
[18:41:55] <Gluesticky> Pay mine too while you are at it. Thanks!
[18:41:56] <Randomage> You have no idea how much I need to pay :P
[18:42:03] <Shad0wByte> lawl
[18:42:13] <Shad0wByte> May I ask a question
[18:42:30] <Randomage> But if you need professional help, there's plenty of people who has experience in wordpress, you should have no problem finding a competent fella :)
[18:42:33] <Shad0wByte> It's not jQuery related I don't believe, although you can do it via jQuery I assume.
[18:42:45] <shoky> Ilhami: http://www.robgonda.com/2012/07/12/wordpress-hacked-spam-backlinks/
[18:43:01] <Randomage> so I wan't that wrong. :D
[18:43:24] <Ilhami> thanks for the help guys.. I will find another theme
[18:43:46] <Randomage> themeforest is somewhat known for wordpress themes
[18:43:56] <Randomage> stick to one frequently updated and you SHOULD be in the safe.
[18:43:58] <Shad0wByte> Also, Say I have a div that receives output via a txt field. I have this div set to scrollable, although it doesn't scroll down when the original screen fills with text.
[18:44:10] <Shad0wByte> It just creates a scroll bar and doesn't auto scroll down.
[18:44:18] <Randomage> Receives output?
[18:44:25] <Randomage> uh, what?
[18:44:29] <Shad0wByte> It's a div
[18:44:33] <Shad0wByte> that I use to send output too from an input
[18:44:53] <Ilhami> so themeforrest themes are the best
[18:44:58] <Shad0wByte> well I send input from the <input> and jQuery prints it out in a $('#div').html()
[18:44:59] <Randomage> so it's a div who's content is copied from an input text value?
[18:45:34] <Shad0wByte> The problem is that when it receives to much text, it is set to scrollable but doesn't auto scroll down
[18:45:39] <Randomage> Ilhami, that's a blanket statement, it's like asking "which religion is best". Themeforest is famous, and used in professional circles, you might have better luck there.
[18:46:14] <Ilhami> There is only one correct religion and thats Islam :)
[18:46:16] <Ilhami> I will try to ask
[18:46:19] <Ilhami> people
[18:46:49] <Randomage> Er, thank god I'm an atheist. Yes, it was meant to be an oximoronic sentence :P
[18:46:58] <Shad0wByte> lol
[18:47:03] <Shad0wByte> Randomage, can you help me though
[18:47:47] <Randomage> Shad0wByte, it looks like a complex need, and there's some stuff that basically doesn't make sense.
[18:47:55] <Shad0wByte> Sorry lol
[18:48:01] <Randomage> let me try to rephrase
[18:48:01] <Dexx1_> line 9 on javascript: http://jsfiddle.net/WnZnE/3/ -- trying to get the "minus" image to show up upon clicking -- any tips?
[18:48:04] <Shad0wByte> Hmm, if you have time I'll try to explain it
[18:48:53] <Randomage> you have a div who receives input strings from an <input> text value (on which event?), and you need the div to scroll when the text exceeds the div size?
[18:49:07] <Randomage> Have you tried setting overflow: auto; on the div's css rules?
[18:49:26] <Shad0wByte> $(this).toggleClass('img_close')  <-- You have no selector, is it a div or a class
[18:49:29] <Randomage> also, make an example of what you have available to people, either on your site or on jsfiddle
[18:49:46] <Shad0wByte> Randomage, Yes, the overflow: auto; is set
[18:49:49] <Shad0wByte> that's all fine and dandy
[18:50:04] <Randomage> then I'm gonna need a sample to work on.
[18:50:05] <Shad0wByte> I'm just saying that once it gets so much text, it scrolls down, but the div itself doesn't follow the text.
[18:50:16] <Shad0wByte> Like it just stays in one spot and shows the top line, instead of following the bottom line.
[18:50:21] <Shad0wByte> Can you teamviewer?
[18:50:31] <Shad0wByte> I'll send my infoz
[18:50:42] <Shad0wByte> It's really simple once you see it xD
[18:51:15] <Randomage> I can't
[18:51:32] <Randomage> make a sample test on jsfiddle.com with just a barebone version.
[18:51:47] <Ilhami> Randomage cant
[18:51:51] <Ilhami> he didnt want to see mine
[18:51:55] <Ilhami> so why would he see yours? :D
[18:52:10] <Randomage> people will be able to help you better with a (non) working example.
[18:52:36] <Shad0wByte> hmm ok, let me try this
[18:52:39] <Shad0wByte> It all works
[18:52:40] <Randomage> now if you excuse me, I need to cram on this job, a company that makes red cars is on my ass about it :D
[18:52:41] <Shad0wByte> Like everything works,
[18:52:47] <Shad0wByte> hahaha
[18:52:50] <Dexx1_> Shad0wByte: like so: 	$('#login-form').addClass('img_close');
[18:52:59] <Dexx1_> ?
[18:53:07] <Randomage> Dexx1_, you're misunderstanding what addClass does.
[18:53:38] <Randomage> <div id="login-form"> becomes <div id="login-form" class="img_close"> with your command
[18:53:52] <Randomage> and that change basically does nothing.
[18:53:53] <Shad0wByte> yeah
[18:54:06] <Shad0wByte> what randomage said
[18:54:07] <Dexx1_> hmm
[18:55:40] <Shad0wByte> Why are you doing it like that
[18:55:46] <Shad0wByte> I also don't see an img_close class
[18:55:48] <Dexx1_> asking me?
[18:55:49] <Shad0wByte> in the jfiddle
[18:55:51] <Shad0wByte> Yes
[18:56:28] <Dexx1_> hmm
[18:59:44] <Dexx1_> Shad0wByte: is this the correct way to add a class : 	$('div form').addClass('img_close'); ? to the <form id.....> part
[19:02:06] <Shad0wByte> why not just add it in the html?
[19:03:19] <Dexx1_> Shad0wByte: I have one like this: #login .close { ... -- is that sufficient?
[19:04:22] <shoky> Dexx1_: close is not img_close
[19:05:49] <Dexx1_> oh shit
[19:07:03] <Dexx1_> shoky: ok so I got the minus - sign to show up..except in the wrong place (in the body of the form) how do I make it just the title where the plus sign existed?
[19:08:21] <shoky> Dexx1_: donno what you're doing, link to an updated jsfiddle testcase
[19:08:59] <Dexx1_> shoky:
[19:09:01] <Dexx1_> k
[19:09:03] <Dexx1_> one sec
[19:10:38] <Dexx1_> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/WnZnE/1/
[19:11:11] <shoky> Dexx1_: i dont see a minus sign
[19:13:08] <shoky> (or a plus sign)
[19:13:30] <Dexx1_> shoky: how do I get them to show if the image is on my local machine?
[19:14:03] <Dexx1_> shoky: it's to the LEFT of the word "Login"

[19:17:15] <shoky> you add the class on the same element that had the "minus" background-image
[19:17:45] <Dexx1_> shoky: genius. thanks. now I will go smoke a joint, then return
[19:18:06] <tharkun> I've been using a jquery plugin called cascade on jquery 1.6 I searched it on the jquery site but it gives out nothing. Is the search feature disabled?
[19:18:08] <shoky> guess i'll follow suit
[19:19:14] <Conduit> am I missing something stupid regarding this example - http://jqueryui.com/button/#radio
[19:19:24] <Conduit> is it just me or are the input values not actually changing based on what you click
[19:20:05] <shoky> Conduit: it's not their values which should be changed, it's their "checked" property
[19:20:14] <Conduit> that doesn't seem to change for me
[19:20:28] <shoky> Conduit: it's not the checked attribute that you see on the html tag
[19:21:33] <Conduit> how do I retrieve it then? I tried .is(":checked") and .attr("checked") and neither seem to work
[19:21:56] <shoky> .is(':checked') should work.  and .prop('checked')
[19:22:11] <Conduit> nvm, got it now, thanks
[19:23:11] <ezakimak> trying to build jquery-ui following the README, and after i did npm install inside jquery-ui directory, i try to run grunt and it can't find grunt--event though i installed it as root already
[19:24:33] <shoky> ezakimak: i had a similar issue. it's just some grunt installation problem prolly, maybe you need to install grunt-cli
[19:24:47] <ezakimak> i know nothing about nodejs
[19:24:49] <shoky> globally
[19:24:51] <ezakimak> or npm
[19:24:55] <shoky> npm install -g grunt-cli
[19:25:00] <shoky> as root
[19:25:18] <ezakimak> ah, now there's a grunt binary
[19:25:37] <ezakimak> and it's doing something now
[19:26:17] <ezakimak> so can i now simply edit any ui/*.js then build it and use dist/jquery-ui.js to test from?
[19:26:58] <shoky> yap
[19:27:05] <PAGO> I have got a question. I've got some code here which works. but How do I say that the lyrics ("lyric nummer 1" and "lyric nummer 2") are not shown at the beginning and appear only on click?   http://jsfiddle.net/eUTbn/20/
[19:27:29] <ezakimak> shoky, sweet thanks!
[19:27:35] <shoky> np
[19:27:38] * ezakimak is trying to fix a bug in sortable
[19:28:58] <shoky> g'luck
[19:38:13] <iliketurtles> anyone have any idea why jqueryUI .resizable() might work only vertically and not horizontally on some <li> elements?
[19:38:52] <iliketurtles> i have tried removing all CSS and the issue persists. I am not calling .resizable() with any object literal passed in
[19:39:16] <shoky> iliketurtles: can you reproduce it on jsfiddle or jsbin?
[19:40:21] <iliketurtles> shoky: yeah give me a minute
[19:42:24] <iliketurtles> shoky: could i send you a github repo to clone, would be easier
[19:43:01] <shoky> iliketurtles: easier for you, harder for me
[19:43:15] <iliketurtles> shoky: haha truth
[19:43:16] <shoky> a jsfiddle shows me the actual issue
[19:43:37] <shoky> and i can easily.. fiddle with it
[19:43:45] <iliketurtles> shoky: sure, just a lot of my JS is backbone external files
[19:43:49] <iliketurtles> shoky: give me a min
[19:44:10] <shoky> those are not relevant at all tho, it sounds like
[19:44:21] <shoky> make a minimal testcase
[19:49:03] <bobshi_> xxxx:...
[19:51:04] <Dexx1_> shoky: in http://jsfiddle.net/WnZnE/5/ -- how can I have it so that the form ONLY toggles/slides back in if you click the "top Login" bar instead of the form?
[19:53:12] <shoky> Dexx1_:  you have the click handler on $('#login') which is the whole login div
[19:53:38] <shoky> Dexx1_:  if you dont want to handle clicks on all of #login, then don't use that as the selector, use what you DO what to be clickable.
[19:55:23] <shoky> what=want
[19:55:26] <Dexx1_> hmm
[19:56:37] <Dexx1_> ah ok
[19:59:40] <tharkun> I need to cascade two autocomplete widgets, how do U
[20:18:02] <ericandrewlewis> while using .post, i'm sending data in the form of a javascript object
[20:18:23] <ericandrewlewis> i have a boolean object instance variable set to false
[20:18:33] <ericandrewlewis> but on the PHP receiving side, it gets cast as a string
[20:18:40] <ericandrewlewis> "false", which is truthy
[20:18:50] <ericandrewlewis> best practice? deal with it on the PHP side?
[20:18:55] <ericandrewlewis> or am i doing it wrong?
[20:28:37] <snover> ericandrewlewis: uh, boolean values will be carried across just fine if you are actually providing a boolean value.
[20:29:01] <ericandrewlewis> snover: actually no they won't, found the answer - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7408976/bool-parameter-from-jquery-ajax-received-as-literal-string-false-true-in-php
[20:30:21] <snover> actually, yes they will
[20:30:23] <snover> because i do this
[20:30:28] <snover> all the time
[20:30:45] <Dexx1_> jquery question: http://jsfiddle.net/WnZnE/6/ -- lines 9-19, I am trying to show a CSS style when hovered over the "submit button" (id: button) and that style removed when not hovering..
[20:33:41] <Foxhoundz> have you tried .hover()?
[20:39:06] <ericandrewlewis> snover: surprising then that i'm having the exact same problem described very clearly in that stack overflow discussion
[20:41:22] <snover> how are you decoding the json string on the server-side?
[20:41:33] <khmer> yeah this is a deserializer problem
[20:41:58] <snover> https://gist.github.com/csnover/5457353
[20:42:06] <snover> itâs boolean to me.
[20:42:10] <ezakimak> shoky, i figured out what it's doing wrong, now to figure out where the code is miscalculating
[20:42:32] <ezakimak> wish i could talk to one of the devs that wrote it
[20:42:41] <snover> ericandrewlewis: ^
[20:43:12] <ericandrewlewis> snover: i was talking about using the jQuery .post() method to push the data through
[20:43:39] <ezakimak> post is just a wrapper to ajax(), with method: 'post'
[20:43:56] <snover> um
[20:43:59] <snover> json data?
[20:44:08] <snover> or are you just passing an object?
[20:44:16] <ezakimak> define object
[20:44:17] <snover> the default serialization method is x-www-form-urlencoded
[20:44:24] <snover> not json
[20:44:32] <snover> dataType is for the received data, not the transmitted data
[20:44:41] <snover> how about you show us some code
[20:45:56] <ezakimak> any jquery ui sortable devs here?
[20:46:21] <ericandrewlewis> i am passing an object, that's the issue. boolean instance variables in JS supposedly get encoded into strings when the request is being made
[20:47:05] <ezakimak> you have to serialize your data somehow
[20:47:43] <snover> ericandrewlewis: the âhackâ in that post is not a hack at all, it is the way to properly transmit and receive structured data
[20:48:18] <snover> i did not read it properly becauseâ¦frankly solutions are not usually in the OP
[20:49:45] <ericandrewlewis> yeah i went with modifying the instance variable before sending to post() with ( true ) ? '1' : '0';
[20:50:43] <snover> oh, okay, because *thatâs* not a hack :)
[20:51:24] <ericandrewlewis> ;)
[21:15:07] <Shad0wByte> hmm, in jQuery
[21:15:13] <Shad0wByte> if I do this why doesn't it change the value of dir
[21:15:21] <Shad0wByte> var dir;
[21:15:40] <Shad0wByte> var input = $('#input1').val();
[21:16:14] <Shad0wByte> if(input == 'home') { dir = "home"; } alert(dir);
[21:16:17] <Shad0wByte> and dir is still blank
[21:19:29] <vladikoff> Shad0wByte, http://codepen.io/anon/pen/GBqlE
[21:21:14] <sprezzatura> for some reason, my form(that uses jquery) is not getting submitted. the page remains as-is . When i put an click event for the button, the alert is getting triggered, but the form is not submitted. How can i debug this?
[21:21:46] <sprezzatura> i do not have .submit(), but am expecting an auto-subimt
[21:42:48] <ezakimak> Shad0wByte, log input and see what it is
[21:42:56] <Dexx1_> jquery question: http://jsfiddle.net/WnZnE/6/ -- lines 9-19, I am trying to show a CSS style when hovered over the "submit button" (id: button) and that style removed when not hovering..
[21:47:40] <Cork> Dexx1_: you'r going to bind a new click handler on #open every time you move out from #button
[21:47:49] <Cork> Dexx1_: make that a static event listener instead
[21:48:42] <Foxhoundz> Dexx1_: http://jsfiddle.net/WnZnE/7/
[21:48:46] <Cork> Dexx1_: and why don't you just use :hover instead of doing it through js?
[21:49:14] <Foxhoundz> I assumed he wanted to do custom js effects with it
[21:49:47] <Foxhoundz> But as I suggeted before Dexx1_ .hover() should work fine for your needs. If it's just a CSS manipulation, go with Cork's suggestion
[21:49:47] <Dexx1_> hmm
[21:50:18] <Gluesticky> What was wrong with the original? It works?
[21:50:37] <Foxhoundz> I also changed the <input> into a <button>
[21:50:45] <Cork> Gluesticky: 1. it will add a constant stream of click handlers on the #open element
[21:51:18] <Gluesticky> But the open isn't part of the bind?
[21:51:36] <Cork> Gluesticky: it is in the original one
[21:51:53] <Cork> ah...
[21:52:00] <Gluesticky> Are you sure? He just has bad indent.
[21:52:01] <Cork> indent miss match
[21:52:04] <Cork> no, i saw wrong
[21:52:34] <Gluesticky> The thing he was missing from the original was there was no css for effect yet.
[21:53:30] <Cork> ya, when looking at it again, there isn't really anything wrong with it
[21:53:47] <Cork> (well my question about :hover still stands though)
[22:00:15] * ezakimak wonders why sortable isn't implemented as a combination of draggable + droppable, instead it duplicates tons of code
[22:12:21] <Cork> ezakimak: cause often you want to have just sortable
[22:12:37] <Cork> ezakimak: and they don't duplicate that much code, as they inherit from a base class
[22:12:54] <ezakimak> they only inherit mouse
[22:13:08] <Cork> i know
[22:15:05] <ezakimak> well, draggable.connectToSortable does it right, sortable's dragging to another sortable gets it wrong :(
[22:17:58] <ezakimak> a sticky wicket to unravel...
[22:29:48] <iliketurtles> shoky: sorry had to run out, got the fiddle up now, can't resize the left blue <li> horizontally, only vertically: http://jsfiddle.net/3Ka5V/12/show/#00ACEB,
[22:33:07] <iliketurtles> and if anyone else cares to look at the above fiddle ^  for some reason .resizable() works only vertically and not horizontally on the blue <li> element on the left.
[22:39:40] <sprezzatura> i have  hidden var that is outside a form. and i want to pass this var during form submit. how do i do it?
[22:41:02] <iliketurtles> sprezzatura: could use a hidden field?
[22:41:41] <sprezzatura> iliketurtles: i am using a hidden field, but that is 'outside' teh form. does the field get submitted during for submit?
[22:42:23] <iliketurtles> sprezzatura: ah i see, no it doesn't.  what's the reason for having it outside the form
[22:42:24] <Gluesticky> Can't you put it inside the form?
[22:42:52] <iliketurtles> sprezzatura: in html5 you can use <input form="formName" type="whatever">
[22:42:59] <iliketurtles> but you should just put it inside the form if possible
[22:43:21] <sprezzatura> iliketurtles: i have a 3-4 forms and 'one' of the forms is displayed based on the selecttion(radio buttons/buttons) before. i want to capture this 'type' and submit along with the form submit
[22:44:08] <sprezzatura> else i have to copy the fields into each of teh forms. code duplication. but looks like thats the way!
[22:44:34] <iliketurtles> sprezzatura: send over a jsfiddle and ill take a look
[22:44:59] <sprezzatura> iliketurtles: ah. will take a few mins. pretty big piece of code :) ..let me try
[22:45:28] <iliketurtles> sprezzatura: just put the form pieces in
[22:45:49] <sprezzatura> but the idea is this : do not show any form in the begining. show just the types of forms. when the user chooses one of these, show the respective form. now the 'type' that the user chose in the 1st step needs to be submitted on form submit
[22:46:56] <Gluesticky> Well copying the fields like you said should work.
[22:47:27] <sprezzatura> Gluesticky: yes. but can the fields have teh same id?
[22:48:19] <Gluesticky> You only care about the name right?
[22:49:14] <sprezzatura> 'value'
[22:49:21] <sprezzatura> i can set the value of that type
[22:49:50] <Gluesticky> Well when you submit it, only the name and value will matter? Not the id?
[22:49:56] <sprezzatura> right
[22:50:10] <sprezzatura> but i need to set the value of that field by accessing the id in jquery...right
[22:50:20] <sprezzatura> what happens if multiple hidden fields have the same id?
[22:50:33] <sprezzatura> does jquery set for all. or only the first one?
[22:50:45] <iliketurtles> sprezzatura: multiple fields can't have the same ID and be valid HTML
[22:50:45] <ezakimak> isn't the form name submitted with the form?
[22:51:07] <ezakimak> or the name of the submit button?
[22:51:13] <iliketurtles> sprezzatura: maybe you should look up a better solution for having a radio button that generates a form
[22:51:38] <sprezzatura> iliketurtles: ok. i was thinking of ajax. but have issues with styling and lots of anti-Dry
[22:51:45] <iliketurtles> it sounds like you're overcomplicating the problem
[22:52:20] <ezakimak> you could use knockout, and tie the shared values to a viewmodel observable, it will sync them for you
[22:53:19] <iliketurtles> ^
[22:53:44] <ezakimak> be about 4 lines of code to sync one value across several hidden inputs (1 per form)
[22:54:43] <sprezzatura> $('#id').val('<value>'); should set the value of the hidden var..right?
[22:55:48] <sprezzatura> ezakimak: i would love to. but i do not want to include another js for just one small functionality
[22:56:12] <ezakimak> then you'll have to wire up all the onchange handlers by hand
[22:56:44] <ezakimak> actually, i guess it's just one per radio
[22:57:07] <ezakimak> and w/a jq selector, you can do all at once I guess
[22:59:31] <sprezzatura> ezakimak: how do i set the value of multiple hidden fields having the same name?
[23:00:11] <sprezzatura> $('input:hidden[name="qtyTextHidden"]').val( 'myval');  ...thisway?
[23:00:39] <ezakimak> you shouldn't need :hidden, although it may be faster
[23:01:18] <sprezzatura> ezakimak: hmm. doesnt seem to work.
[23:03:25] <ezakimak> try: $('input:[name=radioname]').each(function(radio) { $('input[name=hiddenname]'.each(function(hidden) { radio.bind({'onSelect': function() { hidden.val(radio.val()); }) })
[23:03:32] <curvedmark> has anyone had luck with jquery 2.0 source map? I can't seem to set a break point in the uncompressed file with chrome canary. demo: http://jsfiddle.net/UTDgZ/
[23:03:37] <ezakimak> not sure if onSelect is the right handler
[23:06:54] <sprezzatura> ezakimak: mea culpa! mistake bitten '-' and '_' and hence! kill me plz.
[23:07:02] <sprezzatura> works . perfectly fine.
[23:07:05] <sprezzatura> phew! that was easy
[23:07:34] * iliketurtles kills sprezzatura
[23:07:46] <iliketurtles> (:
[23:08:16] * sprezzatura lays in a sheet of blood
[23:08:30] * sprezzatura gets and picksup his saber. kills everything on his way
[23:08:57] * ezakimak lends sprezzatura a kitten
[23:10:16] * sprezzatura gets back to his bat cave
[23:11:22] <ezakimak> damn. just found a second bug with sortable.
[23:12:06] <ezakimak> and....surprise surprise draggable gets it right again
[23:12:18] <ezakimak> -1 for not sharing code
[23:15:08] <iliketurtles> ezakimak: do you have any experience with jqueryUI resizable?
[23:15:25] <ezakimak> no
[23:15:30] <ezakimak> what is it?
[23:15:55] * ezakimak debates writing a new sortable that reuses draggable and droppable
[23:16:40] <iliketurtles> just lets you resize an element like it's a windows/finder window
[23:17:13] <ezakimak> today's the first time i've really begun digging into jq ui source code
[23:18:27] <curvedmark> ok, it's a known issue, found it on tracker.
[23:22:44] <Nebros> good morning. i have a little problem with jquery.validate.js it works fine but when i tape in something wrong in the input field, the error message moves the field to the right that it has place to show... how can i change this? this is my style code http://jsfiddle.net/DFvXX/
[23:24:45] <ezakimak> damn. this code is a pita to follow
[23:26:10] <Nebros> mine?
[23:29:35] <ezakimak> no. sortable and draggable
[23:34:59] <ezakimak> wow. impossible to use the debugger, since it interferes with the mouse interaction
[23:39:59] <xec> Nebros: the demo isn't showing anything, missing html and js (and you shouldn't have html in the css field)

[23:48:56] <Cork> sadly...
[23:49:40] <xec> Cork: does it do see ?mdn setTimeout
[23:49:47] <Cork> no
[23:49:48] <xec> apparently not
[23:49:49] <xec> :D
[23:49:51] <Cork> that's bot-t
[23:50:10] <Cork> the new bot uses `key-word
[23:50:40] <lenswipee> perhaps i should provide some contexts. i would like to implement an ajax loader when user clicks an icon. my thoughts is to provide a set time out to revert ajax loader back to original icon when "nothing" happens/loads.
[23:51:11] <Cork> lenswipee: that answer still stands
[23:51:18] <Cork> there is only one way actually
[23:51:24] <Cork> and that is through the setTimeout
[23:51:33] <lenswipee> ok
[23:51:45] <Cork> if you want it to wait until the ajax call ends one way or the other use .always
[23:51:45] <ezakimak> why would nothing happen/load?
[23:51:46] <lenswipee> what time is recommened?
[23:52:09] <ezakimak> you can set an error handler on it already, and iirc it has a timeout option you can set
[23:52:14] <Cork> lenswipee: recommended would be to handle the connection failing and use that instead
[23:52:56] <Cork> /* start throbber */ $.ajax().alweays(function() { /* remove throbber */ })
[23:53:59] <lenswipee> why not "revert back" in ajax call back function?
[23:54:24] <xec> lenswipee: that's what that code *is* ... ?
[23:54:25] <Cork> lenswipee: sure, but in that case use the complete: callback
[23:54:55] <Cork> lenswipee: success => done(), error => fail(), complete => always()
[23:55:39] <ezakimak> timeouts invoke only complete, correct?
[23:55:48] <ezakimak> er always()
[23:56:10] <ezakimak> so in there you just need to test for complete or not?
[23:56:14] <Cork> connection timeout triggers error/fail and complete/always
[23:56:57] <ezakimak> i thought error was only triggered for say 404/5xx?
[23:57:04] <Cork> nope
[23:57:15] <Cork> error/fail is triggered if the call fails
[23:57:30] <Cork> 404, timeout, parsing error, code error
[23:57:55] <Cork> you need to check the return status to know what caused it
[23:58:24] <lenswipee> Cork: not sure i follow the sucess, error, fail part. so far i got something like: function( data ) { if ( data == 'OK' ) { //means successful } else { //not successful so add code to revert back}
[23:58:50] <Cork> uh... no
[23:59:09] <Cork> lenswipee: first are you using $.ajax  or $.post or what?
[23:59:11] <lenswipee> can someone show me a test case on how this should be done right
[23:59:17] <lenswipee> $.ajax
[23:59:28] <Cork> lenswipee: i just did a little while back
[23:59:31] <okdamn> hi there, anyway to fire when scrolling page down and footer appears ?
[23:59:55] <okdamn> i mean, :visible is not good cause footer is always visible but user see that when scrolled x pixels down
