[00:13:01] <ElJeffe> :/
[02:02:37] <Al_nz1> this doesnt look right
[02:02:37] <Al_nz1> $("<p class='"'label label-danger'"'>Not found</p>").insertAfter( $(this).find('.nia') );
[02:04:28] <Cork> i would prob just do $(this).find('.nia').after($('<p>', { class: 'label label-danger', text: 'Not found' }));
[02:14:57] <Al_nz1> Cork: yeah got it to go. thanks
[02:15:35] <Al_nz1> This is part of some ajax async stuff. If result comes back result = "" I need to test for that and handle. Thats not the same as result = null?
[02:15:45] <Al_nz1> just test result = "" ?
[02:17:23] <Cork> ==
[02:17:33] <Cork> = sets
[02:18:52] <Al_nz1> thats what I meant :)
[02:24:22] <Cork> Al_nz1: actually if you want to catch null and "" you can do if(!result) {}
[02:24:33] <Cork> that will catch result=false too though
[02:25:02] <Al_nz1> Cork: right. good tip thanks
[02:25:38] <Al_nz1> It would be quite nice to display the mesage breifly and fade out, but thats probably not a jquery function
[02:25:56] <Cork> sure it can
[02:25:58] <hellyeah> looks like you want animation
[02:26:11] <hellyeah> fade out what i meant
[02:26:15] <Al_nz1> yeah
[02:26:20] <Cork> .text(new_message).delay(5000).fadeOut(300)
[02:26:41] <Cork> just keep the container constant instead of inserting it and then animate it
[02:26:51] <Al_nz1> is that appendable to $theForm.find('.nia').after('<p class="label label-danger">Person not found - continue entering details</p>');
[02:27:08] <Cork> no, but it is with the code i gave you
[02:27:23] <Al_nz1> thats jquery?
[02:27:29] <Cork> ya
[02:27:56] <Cork> $(this).find('.nia').after($('<p>', { class: 'label label-danger', text: 'Not found' }).delay(5000).fadeOut(300, function() { $(this).remove() }));
[02:28:07] <hellyeah> i guess there is no problem write javascript with jquery. These are jquery's function anyway
[02:28:40] <Cork> uh, jquery is javascript so that statement doesn't make sense
[02:29:30] <Al_nz1> Cork: yeah that works real nice
[02:30:08] <Al_nz1> and finally is there a way to make sure that if the button is clicked more than once in quick succession the message is only appended once?
[02:30:26] <hellyeah> Cork:  sorry what i meant is you can use vanilla js things with jquery together. I mistyped may be
[02:30:30] <Cork> Al_nz1: i would recommend setting disabled on the button on click
[02:30:40] <Cork> Al_nz1: and in the ajax .always callback remove disabled
[02:30:41] <Al_nz1> for 5s I guess
[02:30:45] <Cork> no
[02:30:50] <Cork> until the server responds
[02:31:03] <Cork> that is usually enough to prevent double clicks
[02:31:13] <hellyeah> you may use .one to avoid multiple click on element
[02:31:25] <Al_nz1> but after the server responds, which could be in 1s the message is still there and the user can click again
[02:31:30] <hellyeah> instead of .on
[02:31:37] <Al_nz1> resulting in multipe Not FOund
[02:31:45] <hellyeah> Cork:  will it work?
[02:31:58] <Cork> Al_nz1: you can check if the p element exists and not add it again if it is
[02:32:12] <Al_nz1> yeah, ok so put some if statements in
[02:32:33] <Cork> Al_nz1: $(this).find('.nia').next('.label-danger').length < 1
[02:32:33] <Al_nz1> gtg to dinner guys.
[02:32:51] <Al_nz1> mint Cork - will try it soon. Thanks
[04:09:54] <tesorito> need some help with "disable" checkbox instead of give result "empty" --> http://jsfiddle.net/ar3PY/92/
[04:11:08] <Cork> tesorito: i already told you this last time, you need a list of all valid combinations
[04:11:50] <Cork> before that you can't really preemptively disable checkbox without having to loop all checkboxes AND options for every time a checkbox is changed
[04:12:49] <tesorito> Cork: that excacly what I need help with :)
[04:13:11] <Cork> tesorito: that is a static list, not something the code can find out
[04:13:41] <Cork> well the code can find it out but it means looping over all results + all combinations of the checkboxes
[04:13:48] <Cork> and that would be very slow
[04:14:13] <tesorito> thats ok, only so it works =)
[04:14:20] <Cork> if you can provide a list of the combinations using it to filter it isn't that hard
[04:14:39] <Cork> tesorito: ok, then on page load make sure all checkboxes are disabled
[04:14:46] <Cork> then enable the last one
[04:14:53] <Cork> update all the results
[04:15:00] <Cork> check that it has a result
[04:15:14] <Cork> and then step through each binary combination of the checkbox
[04:15:21] <Cork> until you have checked them all
[04:15:25] <Cork> and you have the list
[04:16:05] <Cork> meaning 00000000001 => 00000000010 => 00000000011 and so on
[04:16:16] <tesorito> all checkboxes should be enabled when I visit page
[04:16:18] <Cork> expect it to take quite some time
[04:16:55] <tesorito> will this take a minute to show in jsfiddle?
[04:17:57] <Cork> depends on the number of results and option combinations
[04:18:11] <tesorito> like it is now?
[04:18:17] <Cork> no
[04:18:26] <tesorito> seconds ?
[04:18:35] <Cork> right now it filter results based on the checked checkboxes, this is much much demanding
[04:19:41] <tesorito> But like you describe, that all checkboxes are disabled when page load
[04:19:49] <tesorito> I want them to be enabled ?
[04:19:58] <tesorito> else I cant click them :S ?
[04:21:44] <Cork> tesorito: no you have to loop over them and checking what result each combination gives
[04:21:52] <Cork> as you don't have the data it has to be produced
[04:23:14] <tesorito> ok, if you have time now or later this day I would much happy if you could show me jsfiddle
[04:41:43] <tesorito> can I in some quick way change angular code to jquery --> https://codepen.io/thelifenadine/pen/rammwv
[04:42:22] <Cork> not really no
[04:42:37] <tesorito> this was something I was looking for
[04:42:56] <tesorito> In jquery thou
[04:43:19] <Cork> what exactly are you looking for?
[04:43:47] <Cork> there prob exists way to do it, you can't just do a quick change of the angular code though
[04:44:05] <Cork> it most likely will have to be rewritten close to completely
[04:45:03] <tesorito> okey, haha try to find another way
[04:50:46] <Robin___> Why does the link (line 36) dissapear after clicking it? :O thanks: https://pastebin.com/AzS8ezVb
[05:15:27] <Cork> Robin___: http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[05:15:33] <Cork> "Description: Display or hide the matched elements."
[05:15:52] <tesorito> Cork: here is one like mine: But it missing the disable thing too ---> http://jsfiddle.net/pm7fvauq/1/
[05:15:59] <Cork> Robin___: the toggle function .toggle was deprecated in 1.8 and removed in 1.9
[05:16:31] <Cork> Robin___: also please use jsfiddle when you ask questions like that https://jsfiddle.net/76cj9h0r/
[05:16:36] <Robin___> Cork: What was it replaced with? :) thx
[05:16:37] <Robin___> ok
[05:16:39] <Cork> don't ask ppl to render html in there head
[05:16:43] <Cork> Robin___: nothing
[05:16:57] <Cork> if you want to toggle you will have to keep that state your self
[05:18:20] <Cork> Robin___: ex. https://jsfiddle.net/76cj9h0r/1/
[05:19:30] <Robin___> Cork: thanks alot
[05:20:14] <Cork> Robin___: an option is to use css3 transition
[05:20:48] <Robin___> Cork: yes :) but atm im practising jquery. thx tho
[05:21:17] <Cork> Robin___: it would still be jquery though :)
[05:22:02] <tesorito> Cork : closer -> http://jsfiddle.net/ppzwmvs9/7/
[05:22:41] <Cork> Robin___: just for the fun of it: https://jsfiddle.net/76cj9h0r/2/
[05:23:25] <Robin___> Cork: that looks way cleaner
[05:23:26] <Robin___> :O
[05:24:16] <Cork> Robin___: can actually do better ;P
[05:31:14] <Cork> Robin___: btw don't use event attributes, and don't abuse links for click actions
[05:32:21] <Robin___> Its the only way I know atm. give me a few days and I come up with a better solution :)
[05:40:00] <shakaponk> hey guys, a regular js-function mySimpleGetFunction(){ return $.get(…) } . i want this function to return the resulting jqXHR so that i can perform done, error … somewhere else. example mySimpleGetFunction().done(…).error(…) but i get mySimpleGetFunction(…).done(…).error is not a function
[05:40:46] <shakaponk> performing done inside mySimpleGetFunction works just fine
[05:41:13] <shakaponk> oh fuck, its fail not error
[05:41:16] <shakaponk> nevermind
[05:57:13] <stennowork> still a bit confused what jquery actually does with serializeArray and why it doesn't work in regard to sumoselect multiselect
[05:57:37] <stennowork> $("#mysumoselect option:selected") gives me all the selected options in the multiselect
[05:57:50] <stennowork> but .serializeArray still only provides a single values
[05:57:52] <stennowork> -s
[05:58:14] <stennowork> i guess i just have to inject the multiselect values manually after i called .serializeArray
[05:58:46] <stennowork> oh hm sec
[06:00:40] <stennowork> oh i see now, my own preperations destroy the object
[06:00:46] <stennowork> ok, it was my own fault v_v
[06:09:56] <stennowork> i wished that serializeArray would serialize to an object instead of array
[06:11:05] <stennowork> like, {foo: 23, multi_values: ["zomg", "lol"]} instead of [{name: "foo", value: 23}, {name: "multi_values", value "zomg"}, {name: "multi_values", value: "lol"}]
[06:12:05] <stennowork> as of now i have to run another .reduce on .serializeArray and its not even that trivial as it first might appear
[06:14:53] <stennowork> can't wait until IE is dead and we can finally use native es6 stuff without having to babel or w/e
[06:58:26] <Cork> stennowork: it grabs the form fields and loop over them and collect the values
[06:58:53] <stennowork> yes
[06:59:17] <stennowork> which is somewhat ok
[06:59:24] <stennowork> but not exactly what it could be
[07:00:24] <Cork> stennowork: could you create a jsfiddle with the field in question and the serializeArray call?
[07:00:39] <stennowork> thats already solved
[07:00:47] <stennowork> <stennowork> oh i see now, my own preperations destroy the object
[07:00:47] <stennowork> <stennowork> ok, it was my own fault v_v
[07:01:02] <Cork> ah
[07:01:17] <stennowork> but i can show a test case of this inconvenience, sce
[07:02:56] <jorgesumle_> I'm trying to change the value of an attribute for an element created with jQuery. How can I make it work=
[07:03:17] <Cork> jorgesumle_: if you work with a string, convert it to a dom element and stop using the string
[07:04:25] <jorgesumle_> This is what I do:   $('.form-control:first').prop('disabled', 'disabled')
[07:04:35] <Cork> its true/false not 'disabled'
[07:04:46] <Cork> you are setting 'disabled', true) there
[07:04:53] <Cork> as !!'disabled' == true
[07:05:55] <jorgesumle_> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6961526/correct-value-for-disabled-attribute
[07:06:10] <jorgesumle_> If I set it to disable, it should be disabled
[07:06:22] <Cork> prop is properties, not attribute
[07:06:31] <jorgesumle_> I mean, it should have this code: <input disabled="disabled">
[07:06:45] <Cork> and the property disabled is a boolean
[07:06:46] <jorgesumle_> What's the difference between a prop and an attr?
[07:06:55] <Cork> and disabled="disabled" is for xhtml
[07:07:04] <Cork> html ignores the part after =
[07:07:19] <Cork> jorgesumle_: attribute is what you have in html, property is what a dom element has
[07:07:34] <Cork> so when the dom element changes state the prop changes, while the attribute doesn't
[07:07:41] <stennowork> meaning disabled="false" would still disable :P
[07:07:50] <Cork> yes
[07:07:58] <Cork> while prop('disabled', false) will not
[07:08:36] <Cork> to go a little deeper .attr(attr, value) is elm.setAttribute(attr, value)
[07:08:52] <Cork> and .prop(key, value) is elm.<key> = value
[07:09:32] <jorgesumle_> Oh, now it works
[07:09:56] <Cork> as long as you give it the correct values it should work find :)
[07:10:04] <Cork> fine even...
[07:11:14] <jorgesumle_> Thanks for your help Cork
[07:11:20] <Cork> np
[07:11:31] <jorgesumle_> Your a jQuery hacker.
[07:11:49] <jorgesumle_> *You're
[07:12:03] <dimm> hello!
[07:12:09] <jorgesumle_> Hello, dimm
[07:12:15] <dimm> why can i got wrong sorting now with datatables?
[07:12:33] <dimm> early it working fine =/
[07:13:04] <dimm> am i right understand that i must search trouble at my php part and not at mysql part?
[07:13:33] <Cork> dimm: js can't connect to your database directly if that is what you mean
[07:13:36] <dimm> am i right understand that sorting via click on table header is after data was loading from mysql?
[07:13:56] <dimm> Cork: yes, this is it
[07:14:09] <Cork> dimm: not sure, it is normally done in sql unless the complete data is loaded over the net
[07:14:24] <Cork> cause you can't sort with a partial data set
[07:15:54] <dimm> Cork: i triyng load data from database to html table and then get availability to user for sorting by some column
[07:16:29] <Cork> dimm: like i said, that is normally done by doing a search in sql and displaying that result client side
[07:16:43] <Cork> cause the only way to do it client side would be for the sql server to send all the data to it
[07:17:22] <dimm> Cork: yes, i have done this (search in sql and displaying at client side)
[07:17:39] <Cork> what is the question then?
[07:17:52] <dimm> https://datatables.net/examples/basic_init/table_sorting.html
[07:18:22] <dimm> this is example
[07:18:43] <dimm> but in my case i have wrong order after trying sorting
[07:18:43] <Cork> again what is the question?
[07:19:13] <dimm> what start point for searching solve of issue in my case?
[07:20:12] <Cork> when datatable makes the ajax call it should include the order as a parameter
[07:20:27] <Cork> make sure the server uses that query to sort the sql result
[07:22:17] <Cork> dimm: https://datatables.net/manual/server-side
[07:22:36] <dimm> am i wrong understand that sorting via click on head of table is client-side sorting?
[07:22:54] <Cork> dimm: is the table data paginated?
[07:23:01] <dimm> yes
[07:23:06] <Cork> then yes
[07:23:19] <Cork> like i've told you trice now, you can't sort with partial data
[07:23:54] <dimm> oh, man
[07:24:03] <dimm> i was wrong translate manual
[07:24:11] <Cork> i would give you something like source: [5,4,6,5,4,3,2] (show first 3) => [4,3,6]
[07:24:20] <Cork> opps typo
[07:24:24] <dimm> now i check sql log and see request when click at header
[07:24:28] <Cork> [4,5,6]
[07:24:43] <Cork> dimm: don't jump the server script
[07:24:56] <Cork> make sure it is actually using the data datatable provides
[07:25:16] <dimm> ok, will check, thx a lot
[07:27:36] <dimm> found this line in script thx a lot again
[07:31:08] <jorgesumle_> Crearly there must be a better way, but this works to make an animation: $('#autores').append(plantilla_autor.hide().fadeIn());
[07:31:20] <jorgesumle_> Meh, it's fine
[07:31:48] <Cork> jorgesumle_: that is about how you will have to do it ya
[07:32:02] <Cork> even css animations will require close to that amount of code
[07:33:33] <jorgesumle_> Yeah, or toggle().toggle() maybe, but I don't like that and don't know if it works either
[07:34:12] <Cork> toggle(),toggle() wouldn't do the same
[07:34:24] <Cork> it would be the same as calling .show() on the element
[07:37:14] <stennowork> hmm now
[07:38:33] <stennowork> this is a noob question i guess: is there a convenient way to get an array of a certain attribute over a jquery element set? for example, i want a list of the values of all 'name' attributes of form inputs:
[07:39:12] <stennowork> right now, i do $("#myform :input").map(function() { return $(this).attr(name); }).get();
[07:39:27] <stennowork> err
[07:39:34] <stennowork> thats .attr("name") of course
[07:40:22] <stennowork> i guess thats already pretty convenient
[07:41:01] <Cork> stennowork: you can lighten it a little by this.name instead of $()
[07:41:07] <Cork> but ya, that is what you need to do
[07:41:11] <stennowork> oh right
[07:41:13] <stennowork> alright, thanks
[07:41:28] <stennowork> no arrow functions unfortunately :)
[07:42:05] <Cork> well sure, if you're ok with just supporting like edge and chrome and firefox from like the last 2 years
[07:42:07] <stennowork> because of the `this` binding of the jquery collection functions
[07:42:32] <dimm> Cork, man it is working now *dancing*
[07:43:00] <stennowork> i think `this` wouldn't be what it's expected to be when using arrow functions? those do strange stuff with the scope
[07:43:02] <Cork> stennowork: you can get the element as an argument too
[07:43:30] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/map/
[07:43:47] <stennowork> oh right, second parameter is the element
[07:43:49] <stennowork> ok!
[07:43:54] <stennowork> thanks for the clarification there
[07:43:58] * dimm buy guyzzz
[07:44:00] <Ice_Strike> $('.area-list').find('.active').html(inputName);
[07:44:05] <Ice_Strike> how to make sure .active is href?
[07:44:13] <Ice_Strike> i mean <a>
[07:44:18] <stennowork> a.active
[07:44:18] <Cork> a.active ?
[07:44:23] <Ice_Strike> yea i tried that
[07:44:26] <Ice_Strike> let me try again
[07:44:36] <stennowork> its def. the correct selector then
[07:44:51] * dimm bye guyzzz!
[07:44:56] <stennowork> bye
[07:44:59] <jorgesumle_> bye
[07:45:29] <Ice_Strike> yea worked
[07:45:36] <Ice_Strike> not sure what I did wrong before
[07:46:13] <Ice_Strike> https://jsfiddle.net/mtpkfsb2/ :)
[07:46:14] <stennowork> maybe an accidental whitespace?
[07:46:20] <stennowork> like "a .active"
[07:47:01] <Cork> check your editor history and compare the link :P
[07:47:19] <Ice_Strike> doesnt matter now :P
[07:47:25] <stennowork> ^_^
[07:48:20] <Ice_Strike> https://jsfiddle.net/r777ryL2/ Would you put $('#area-form-modal').modal('show'); before ajax or success?
[07:48:38] <Ice_Strike> I have notice it take time to show value in edit box, that is why I put modal in the sucess
[07:49:02] <Cork> i would prob show a throbber before and the modal show inside
[07:49:29] <Cork> and possibly a timed delay on the throbber show so the throbber doesn't show unless it takes more then say 1 sec to load
[07:50:59] <Ice_Strike> show throbber on where?
[07:51:00] <Cork> something liie var throbber = setTimeout(function() { /*show throbber */ }, 1000); $.ajax().dona(function() { clearTimeout(throbber); /* rest of code, remove throbber if it is visible, show modal */ }); })
[07:51:14] <Cork> right next to where the user clicked maybe?
[07:51:33] <Cork> donno how your ui looks like
[07:52:11] <Ice_Strike> I could put it on the button
[07:56:19] <Ice_Strike> Cork There will be many modal. I need to look how to avoid duplicating throbber code logic.
[09:42:14] <hallcyon> where can i find the source code for jquery methods?
[09:43:31] <shoky_> github.com/jquery/jquery
[09:43:49] <dimi1947> is it possible to use as a selector the name attribute and not the ID of an element???
[09:44:47] <shoky_> [name="..."]
[09:48:59] <dimi1947> take a look at this code:https://hastebin.com/yipakohafa.scala I have a form with many inputs(in the example you see one of them)..I intend using serialize and the send values of the inputs with ajax...but I must find a way distinguishing the one input from the other....is using the name attribute good idea to distinguish between inputs?
[09:52:21] <shoky_> yes.. but don't give 2 names to the same input ;)
[10:02:10] <dimi1947> shoky_:I suppose you say that cause you see 2 words in the name attribute,form and service,,this code was given to me in a forum and I have not quite understand why
[10:12:04] <dimi1947> shoky_:it is a multidimentional array
[10:12:08] <ElJeffe> hey guys
[10:12:12] <ElJeffe> I am looking for a plugin that can handle a menu like in this page
[10:12:14] <ElJeffe> https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/gmail
[10:12:59] <Uhkis> the top menu is just bootstrap
[10:13:19] <ElJeffe> the sliding menu

[10:21:06] <pressword> hi
[10:21:16] <pressword> $('#myiframe').contentWindow
[10:21:22] <pressword> doesn't work :/ only when I use native DOM
[10:21:25] <pressword> any ways? :)
[10:25:50] <shoky_> dimi1947: i said it because you had the "name" attribute twice, instead of once :)
[10:26:43] <dimi1947> shoky_:now I got it thanks...
[10:27:01] <hari> hi
[10:27:53] <shakaponk> @Cork are you available, may i bother you?
[10:28:40] <Guest85280> how are you
[10:30:55] <shakaponk> hey guys, i have a fiddle, which is working as expected, but it doesn’t work in my project, and i can’t figure out why
[10:30:57] <shakaponk> https://jsfiddle.net/e8wvb8jd/
[10:32:21] <shakaponk> in my case only the first of the ui-components are working, all events are on the nodes, but they are not triggered. and from the second component some other events on child elements are not working
[10:32:53] <shakaponk> when i switch the components. the other one works, including child event handlers
[10:33:01] <shakaponk> i’m totally lost here
[10:34:03] <AwkwardCough> any console errors?
[10:34:08] <shakaponk> no
[10:35:18] <shakaponk> lets say ui-component 2 has some buttons with click handlers in it. they work fine if the container comes first. as soon as i put it below, handlers are not triggered
[10:35:55] <AwkwardCough> 'the container' ?
[10:36:09] <shakaponk> component, sorry
[10:37:33] <AwkwardCough> what do you mean by putting it below?
[10:38:25] <AwkwardCough> one thing i just noticed
[10:38:39] <AwkwardCough> you are triggering the event on the child element, and catching it on the parent element
[10:38:43] <shakaponk> if you would switch positions, first the div-structure of div#panel-upload and then div#panel-sort
[10:39:04] <AwkwardCough> i don't see those things in the fiddle
[10:39:15] <shakaponk> no?
[10:39:25] <shakaponk> https://jsfiddle.net/3p4mmn3b/
[10:39:25] <AwkwardCough> https://jsfiddle.net/e8wvb8jd/ no
[10:39:45] <shakaponk> ah, no update. sorry
[10:39:56] <shakaponk> made it more realistic
[10:40:08] <AwkwardCough> ok, so you are saying if you re-arrange things, it stops working?
[10:40:41] <AwkwardCough> https://jsfiddle.net/3p4mmn3b/1/ ?
[10:41:24] <shakaponk> it is so: sort panel has a table with buttons. their handlers only work if sort comes first. as soon as i put upload above or anything else with the same structure, it stops
[10:41:34] <shakaponk> and only the first is reacting to events
[10:42:26] <shakaponk> yes, the fiddle is just fine… but the same structure in my project doesn’t. i’m trying to figure out why
[10:43:21] <AwkwardCough> It is a bit hard to diagnose something we can not see.
[10:43:32] <shakaponk> hmm hold on a sec
[10:44:12] <shakaponk> @AwkwardCough can i give you an url in private chat?
[10:44:33] <AwkwardCough> sure
[10:51:18] <hallcyon> shoky_: but where are the actually methods i can't find them
[10:58:04] <shoky_> hallcyon: in src/ in different files.. e.g. this is .append()  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L341
[10:58:35] <hallcyon> shoky_: is there anywhere to just see them easily? i can't find hide() for example
[11:01:56] <shoky_> hallcyon: not really, at least not for the current code.  .hide() is originally created here  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/css/showHide.js#L86
[11:03:09] <hallcyon> shoky_: thank you so much for your help sire
[11:03:21] <shoky_> hallcyon: there's also this but as you can see it's not very useful for many methods e.g. .hide()  https://j11y.io/jquery/
[11:04:38] <hallcyon> shoky_: yeah the source code here for hide seems to be different
[11:05:33] <shoky_> hallcyon: because .hide (and some other methods) are later modified in a different place in the code (in effects.js)
[11:05:55] <shoky_> here https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/effects.js#L626
[11:07:20] <hallcyon> ah that makes sense
[11:19:02] <JrWebDev> $('.table).on('click','tr',function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $(this)[0].scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth", block: "start";  $('#user_id').val(to_person.to_id);
[11:19:02] <JrWebDev> };   it scrolls just fine when i click but then when i post/get the page i want to scroll to that same location...my icon gets displayed everytime i post/get with         $('*[data-value="' + $('#user_id').val() + '"]').find('img').css('visibility', 'visible'); but i want it to scroll when i post/get
[11:20:22] <JrWebDev> i tried         $('*[data-value="' + $('#user_id').val() + '"]').find('img').css('visibility', 'visible').scrollIntoView() but it doesnt work;
[11:23:06] <pressword> hi again
[11:23:08] <pressword> $('input[name$="[config]"]').bind('change', function() { alert('Test!'); });
[11:23:10] <pressword> doesn't work
[11:23:16] <pressword> I mean, the input is selected correctly
[11:23:23] <pressword> but when I change something in put I get no alert
[11:23:27] <pressword> so it doesn't work correctly
[11:23:29] <pressword> any ideas? :/
[11:30:32] <JrWebDev> man this jquery room is usually quiet...i guess not alot of people use it
[11:31:31] <stennowork> only 443 people..
[11:34:04] <stennowork> SSL people
[11:42:24] <shakaponk> hey, i don’t understand why .trigger(‘my-custom-event’) is working and .trigger(jQuery.Event(‘my-custom-event’)) is not working
[11:42:28] <shakaponk> see fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/3p4mmn3b/2/
[11:44:16] <racsox> hi
[11:44:54] <racsox> if I do $(document).ready(f1) and then $(document).ready(f2)
[11:45:08] <racsox> both f1 and f2 are executed?
[11:45:24] <racsox> are both?
[11:45:31] <racsox> or just f2
[11:49:04] <racsox> hi
[11:49:06] <jolvera> you can test like $(document).ready(console.log('yo')); $(document).ready(console.log('sup'));
[11:49:08] <shoky_> shakaponk: because that uses the same event object for 2 different events. you can fix it with an .each loop  https://jsfiddle.net/3p4mmn3b/3/
[11:49:10] <jolvera> racsox
[11:50:54] <racsox> jolvera: thanks man
[11:51:08] <jolvera> yw
[11:51:18] <shakaponk> shoky_: wow, ok. thx
[11:51:31] <racsox> jolvera: it was an stupid question lol sorry
[12:02:06] <pressword> $('input[name$="[config]"]').bind('change', function() { alert('Test!'); });
[12:02:08] <pressword> doesn't work :(
[12:02:12] <pressword> no alert when I change the input text
[12:02:16] <pressword> but the selector is OK
[12:02:18] <pressword> any ideas?
[12:02:20] <pressword> ahh
[12:10:41] <cannap> why bind?
[12:35:15] <pressword> cannap: ok, fixed that :D
[12:35:23] <pressword> cannap: I got interesgint question!
[12:35:32] <cannap> yes?
[12:35:34] <cannap> pressword
[12:35:38] <pressword> app in iframe is initialized, how can it tell the outside world that finished?
[12:35:48] <cannap> i dont know :D
[12:35:51] <pressword> iframe load event does only work for iframe - but the app hadn't finished yet
[12:35:52] <pressword> hmm
[12:36:10] <pressword> is it possible to send a custom on ready event so scripts from the outside can sense it?
[12:36:18] <pressword> can I let the window object emit "ready"?
[12:36:28] <robertmaxrees> pressword https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage
[12:36:37] <pressword> so external scripts can see it on the iframe window?
[12:36:44] <robertmaxrees> ^^^ look at that link
[12:37:04] <pressword> robertmaxrees: so not just a simple event?
[12:37:09] <pressword> I don't need complicated cors-stuff
[12:37:30] <robertmaxrees> pressword if you want to send messages back and forth from the iframe, that's going to be a solid option.
[12:37:45] <pressword> robertmaxrees: I only need to notify the external scripts that app is ready
[12:37:48] <pressword> an event would be ok?
[12:37:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:38:08] <robertmaxrees> that's the kind of problem postmessage is trying to address.
[12:38:46] <robertmaxrees> but if you absolutely have to use jquery (for whatever reason) you can access the parent window and do it from there.
[12:40:27] <pressword> robertmaxrees: wordpress :D
[12:40:34] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:40:45] <robertmaxrees> that changes literally nothing about my suggestion >.>
[12:43:09] <ozcanesen> how can i override parseContent function here https://github.com/toopay/bootstrap-markdown/blob/master/js/bootstrap-markdown.js ?
[12:43:28] <robertmaxrees> ozcanesen i might try ##bootstrap
[12:43:43] <hellyeah> hey
[12:43:49] <robertmaxrees> since that's a bootstrap file ;)
[12:43:53] <ozcanesen> robertmaxrees, no it is jquery question
[12:44:13] <robertmaxrees> uh
[12:44:20] <robertmaxrees> how do you figure?
[12:44:20] <ozcanesen> i want to override a function in jquery plugin
[12:44:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:44:29] <robertmaxrees> good luck duder.
[12:47:26] <ozcanesen> i could override the function in instances but could not override the prototype since definition is in anonymous function, i could not access to that scope
[12:47:35] <ozcanesen> i was wondering is anyone knows a trick
[13:03:51] <hellyeah> i will do infinite grid
[13:04:02] <hellyeah> is there a function that makes it easier in jquery?
[13:04:41] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[13:05:20] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:05:56] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't have a grid system sooooo
[13:11:47] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  i found that http://airbnb.io/infinity/
[13:12:30] <robertmaxrees> you mean infinite scroll?
[13:15:20] <hellyeah> actually i dont know exactly
[13:15:45] <robertmaxrees> try describing what you'
[13:15:50] <robertmaxrees> *you're looking for.
[13:16:17] <hellyeah> something similar to this http://slither.io/
[13:17:09] <robertmaxrees> that's using <canvas>
[13:20:07] <hellyeah> i just try to discover
[13:20:12] <hellyeah> how to do that map
[13:20:32] <hellyeah> first thing i considered is do some shape and regerante it like 10.000 times or something
[13:21:02] <hellyeah> does it make sense?
[13:23:09] <robertmaxrees> are you making a game?
[13:23:40] <hellyeah> yes
[13:23:52] <hellyeah> i will do something like slither
[13:24:03] <robertmaxrees> then you want to use canvas.
[13:24:18] <robertmaxrees> look into frameworks for games.
[13:24:36] <hellyeah> canvas for map?
[13:24:44] <hellyeah> could i use svg?
[13:25:30] <robertmaxrees> you really want to find a framework for this.
[13:25:38] <robertmaxrees> and there are TONS of tutorials on how to make games using JS.
[13:25:55] <hellyeah> any framework suggestion?
[13:25:59] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:26:17] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/showcases/javascript-game-engines
[13:26:26] <robertmaxrees> search around on google.
[13:26:28] <robertmaxrees> lots of choice :)
[13:26:42] <robertmaxrees> *choices
[13:31:13] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:32:55] <MassDebates> robret have you  used any of these?
[13:33:10] <robertmaxrees> i have not.  game dev really isn't my forte.
[13:33:18] <MassDebates> ok ty
[13:33:23] <robertmaxrees> why do you ask?
[13:38:43] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[13:41:17] <hellyeah> i dont remember my forte means :/
[13:41:38] <MassDebates> robertmaxrees:  Sorry, I didn't see your reply. Use my name next time
[13:41:43] <robertmaxrees> it's not something I'm very good at.  it's an exaggeration in that i don't really do game dev.
[13:41:57] <MassDebates> robertmaxrees:  2 friends on irc are working on a 3d level editor with javascript for a web game they're making
[13:42:08] <robertmaxrees> neat
[13:42:18] <MassDebates> I wanted to ask some questions about one of the frameworks on here
[13:42:35] <MassDebates> I know nothing about these frameworks
[13:42:48] <robertmaxrees> heh, i would suggest ##javascript for something like that tbh
[13:42:49] <MassDebates> well, I know they're running on goodl ol'e JesuScript
[13:43:02] <MassDebates> yeah. I just saw the link and was curious is all
[13:43:13] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:37:16] <javascriptly> hi
[14:37:24] <MassDebates> hi javascriptly
[14:38:16] <javascriptly> MassDebates: I add event listener - but I found out that it can well happen that before the add event listener has been added the event already happened
[14:38:32] <javascriptly> so I have to check right after addEventListener and invoke the function directly - if condition is met
[14:38:35] <javascriptly> is there a more elegant way?
[14:38:52] <MassDebates> Er
[14:38:57] <MassDebates> That doesn't sound very much like #jquery
[14:39:02] <MassDebates> advise you check out ##javascript
[14:39:10] <MassDebates> Hm, as for your question
[14:39:13] <MassDebates> let me read
[14:39:29] <javascriptly> yes
[14:40:03] <robertmaxrees> javascriptly so you're using addEventListener?
[14:40:05] <MassDebates> hm, yeah, that sounds like it could happen if you start listening after the event already occurrs
[14:40:18] <javascriptly> Robdgreat: yes
[14:40:21] <robertmaxrees> what event are you listening for?
[14:40:23] <javascriptly> indeed
[14:40:28] <javascriptly> frame load
[14:40:31] <MassDebates> oh
[14:40:36] <robertmaxrees> do you control the contents of the iframe?
[14:41:00] <javascriptly> yes
[14:41:27] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage fire this from the iframe when you need it.
[14:41:42] <robertmaxrees> head on over to ##javascript if you need more help :)
[16:33:00] <poboy> I'm brand new to jQuery.  I'm going through codecademy.com right now.  Any particular sites good for learning more?
[16:33:09] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[16:33:11] <robertmaxrees> try.jquery.com
[16:33:11] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:35:29] <poboy> cool, thanks
[16:48:21] <JrWebDev> why isnt this working if (!$(window).focus) { do this } else { do that }
[16:48:40] <robertmaxrees> fiddle
[16:48:41] <robertmaxrees> pls
[16:48:43] <JrWebDev> .focus90*
[16:49:40] <JrWebDev> https://jsfiddle.net/zbtrtv9k/
[16:50:02] <robertmaxrees> erm
[16:50:10] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make any sense.
[16:50:22] <robertmaxrees> $(window).focus(function() {}) binds an even listener.
[16:50:25] <robertmaxrees> *event
[16:50:45] <robertmaxrees> it will pretty much always return true because it returns a jquery object, which is truthy.
[16:50:56] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?  detect when the window loses focus?
[16:51:07] <JrWebDev> yes
[16:51:13] <JrWebDev> when it loses focus something happens
[16:51:33] <robertmaxrees> $(window).blur() maybe?
[16:51:43] <JrWebDev> i tried that didnt work well
[16:51:52] <JrWebDev> only when i focused it it started to work
[16:51:56] <JrWebDev> using .blur
[16:52:01] <JrWebDev> and i didnt use !
[16:52:11] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't use !
[16:52:18] <JrWebDev> of course
[16:52:32] <robertmaxrees> or an if statement around the handler binding
[16:52:39] <JrWebDev> actually i messed up..that was the code i was using
[16:52:42] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/1060034/923919
[16:52:51] <robertmaxrees> this should be helpful.
[16:57:44] <JrWebDev> robertmaxrees, just a quick question why does this always run even if it the window is focused..meaning im on the page
[16:57:44] <JrWebDev> https://jsfiddle.net/479pny56/
[16:57:54] <robertmaxrees> ....
[16:57:59] <robertmaxrees> .blur() binds a listener.
[16:58:09] <robertmaxrees> there's no if () around binding handlers ever
[16:58:15] <robertmaxrees> it'll always retuirn true.
[16:58:27] <JrWebDev> ahhh is ee
[16:58:33] <robertmaxrees> and actually, $(window).blur() triggers that event.
[16:58:37] <robertmaxrees> it's not a "getter"
[16:58:43] <JrWebDev> wow i see
[16:59:32] <robertmaxrees> so if ($().anyjQueryMethod()) {} will always return true
[16:59:54] <JrWebDev> right cause its a method in an object
[17:00:01] <JrWebDev> dang
[17:00:02] <robertmaxrees> not because of that.
[17:00:12] <robertmaxrees> because those methods often return a jquery object.
[17:00:17] <robertmaxrees> and jquery objects are truthy.
[17:01:07] <JrWebDev> i gotta study up better than on jquery
[17:01:13] <JrWebDev> dont know what truthy is
[17:01:21] <JrWebDev> never heard that in any program
[17:01:37] <robertmaxrees> you can think of it this way:
[17:01:45] <robertmaxrees> if you pass the object to if () {}, it'll pass
[17:03:19] <JrWebDev> right
[17:03:24] <robertmaxrees> things that wouldn't pass that are "falsy" - in js, there's just 7
[17:04:18] <robertmaxrees> false, null, undefined, 0, NaN, "" (empty string), and `` (empty literal)
[17:04:30] <JrWebDev> i see
[17:04:31] <robertmaxrees> *template literal
[17:04:48] <robertmaxrees> most jquery methods return a jquery object and so they'll always evaluate true.
[17:04:59] <robertmaxrees> even if you didn't select anything - $('') returns true
[17:05:06] <robertmaxrees> *evaluates as true, rather.
[17:08:01] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[17:10:07] <JrWebDev> yes it makes sense
[17:10:14] <JrWebDev> thanks for explaining it to me very well
[17:10:29] <robertmaxrees> rad
[17:10:39] <JrWebDev> im going to have to do a course on jquery. i did one on javascript but i dont remember all this
[17:10:41] <robertmaxrees> so now you see why your ifs weren't working the way you expected?
[17:10:50] <JrWebDev> yes i do
[17:10:56] <robertmaxrees> all that info wasn't jquery specific fwiw.
[17:11:00] <robertmaxrees> that's js in general.
[17:11:28] <JrWebDev> i must take a course on jquery then because i assumed if i did the js course then it would apply and cover all of jquery with some minor differences
[17:11:34] <JrWebDev> but i should take a course on it now that i see
[17:11:41] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com :)
[17:11:49] <JrWebDev> yes sir
[17:11:54] <JrWebDev> being a junior full stack developer is hard
[17:12:07] <robertmaxrees> *being a developer is hard, period.
[17:12:12] <JrWebDev> too much technology to master but its one hell of an awesome trip! i love it!
[17:12:28] <JrWebDev> it is robertmaxrees your awesome man thanks for all your help!
[17:12:35] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[17:12:53] <JrWebDev> see ya next week enjoy your weekend
[17:12:58] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[17:34:46] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[17:48:34] <goodenough> redux + jquery, best way to create jquery apps now?
[17:48:43] <robertmaxrees> "best way"?
[17:48:56] <goodenough> i dont know, i guess a better way?
[17:49:20] <robertmaxrees> if you're using redux, why not also react?
[17:50:02] <goodenough> i want to, but this shop is still basically html/css/jquery
[17:50:20] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't bring in just redux tbh.
[17:50:30] <robertmaxrees> i mean you could buuut that's not going to solve many problems.
[18:34:44] <Darren_> I have $('#field_mnkc').val().length that returns 0, in my script im saying if it does, to add css to something else, but it doesn't seem to work https://pastebin.com/VLhUBhEw
[18:35:18] <robertmaxrees> (($('#field_dwmw').val().length = 0 means you're trying to set the length.
[18:35:20] <robertmaxrees> you want ===
[18:35:32] <robertmaxrees> alternatively you can do !$('#field_dwmw').val().length
[18:38:49] <Darren_> robertmaxrees thanks, that was it
[19:04:45] <Darren_> hey robertmaxrees I'm now trying this https://pastebin.com/VuB5kLLz, It worked but after a few more refreshes it stopped
[19:07:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:07:32] <robertmaxrees> not sure what refreshes has to do with it.
[19:10:50] <Darren_> I had refreshed the page afterwards and somehow the script stopped working, i'm not sure if I did something ot it or not
[19:11:34] <robertmaxrees> i mean this in the most respectful way possible, but how am I supposed to figure it out without a functioning test case?
[19:12:38] <robertmaxrees> i'd log out or set a breakpoint on that if and see what those values are.
