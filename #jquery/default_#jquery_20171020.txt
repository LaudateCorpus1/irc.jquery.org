[04:03:38] <V7> Are you here Robdgreat
[04:03:42] <V7> OOps
[04:04:35] <V7> Do you know why $( ":not( input )" ).click( function ( ) { } ) ? doesn't work
[04:04:52] <V7> I mean when I'm clicking on input it will trigger too
[04:05:24] <Cork> V7: cause it will bind to the input parent
[04:05:43] <V7> So how to bind to all elements, but inputs ?
[04:05:47] <Cork> you better of binding it to document and check for event.target if it is an input
[04:05:55] <V7> Roger
[04:06:44] <Cork> (also $( ":not( input )" ).click( is extreamly costy)
[04:07:24] <V7> Cork: .is('button') or .is(':button')
[04:07:40] <Cork> depends on if you just want to match <button>
[04:07:52] <Cork> or if you want <input type="button"> too
[04:07:54] <V7> I mean should we add : before an element ?
[04:08:06] <Cork> it isn't an element if it has : before it
[04:08:11] <Cork> then it is a custom selector
[04:08:12] <V7> Roger
[04:08:20] <V7> Like pseudo
[04:08:34] <Cork> exactly, except js css selectors don't have pseudo selectors
[04:08:46] <Cork> so they are emulated with custom selectors
[04:08:51] <Cork> (in jquery)
[04:10:16] <V7> Thank you ery much Cork :)
[04:10:21] <V7> very *
[04:16:11] <madprops> Hi I'm having some trouble preserving the click events when I turn the jquery object into an html element https://paste.ee/p/ZhGhV
[04:16:32] <madprops> i need to change it to an html element to send it to some library that doesn't work with jquery
[04:16:37] <Cork> madprops: you need to keep it as dom elements if you want event handlers to stay around
[04:17:02] <madprops> isn't s[0] a dom element though
[04:17:03] <Cork> an option is to delegate it to a parent that isn't replaced
[04:17:42] <madprops> not sure im following
[04:17:47] <Cork> and as you do the same thing for every "h" element it is optimal for delegation
[04:18:08] <Cork> madprops: http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[04:20:16] <madprops> oh i get it. yeah I could do that. But would be nice to know if it's possible some way to turn a jquery object into "html" without losing the events. In case I encoutner a situation where delegation wouldn't work
[04:20:25] <Cork> you can't
[04:20:47] <Cork> event handlers are dom references a string can't reprecent the dom object
[04:21:06] <madprops> i know but
[04:21:11] <madprops> s[0] is not a string is it?
[04:22:01] <madprops> idk
[04:22:05] <Cork> it isn't the one converting it to html though
[04:22:50] <Cork> if you take a parent.html(pluginProcessing(parent.html())); you WILL lose all the dom elements inside that parent
[04:23:06] <Cork> including all the dom state and events
[04:23:38] <Cork> (html is for sending documents over the wire, it is not what the browser works with)
[04:28:08] <madprops> i see
[04:28:09] <madprops> thanks
[04:34:46] <madprops> Cork, i have a question. I modified it to use .html() directly and it works. But it also works if i live "s = s[0]" .. wouldn't the events be stripped by then?
[04:34:55] <madprops> if i leave*
[04:35:31] <Cork> madprops: i can't solve your problem by looking at an unrelated part of the code...
[04:35:45] <Cork> (something i've indirectly said three times now)
[04:36:25] <Cork> best would be if you could create a working example of the problem in a jsfiddle
[04:36:25] <madprops> it's not a problem, it's a doubt. also you are super subtle then cause it's the first  time i get you hinted that
[04:37:14] <Cork> the link you provided requires a large amount of guessing and speculating to guess at what the problem might be
[04:37:37] <Cork> (as so much of the relevant context is missing)
[04:37:45] <madprops> basically $("#someelement").html(s[0]) keeps the event listeners
[04:37:55] <madprops> where you already saw what s is
[04:38:11] <Cork> if you add the element through .html it isn't converted to a string
[04:38:13] <madprops> so im wondering, because from what you said it seems they shouldn't be kept by then
[04:38:29] <Cork> it is basically the same as parent.empty().append(s[0])
[04:39:00] <madprops> i see
[04:39:53] <madprops> when it didn't work it was because i used "innerHTML=x" i think
[04:40:04] <Cork> ya, cause .html() doens't do that
[04:40:18] <Cork> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L436
[04:40:32] <Cork> if the argument isn't a string it appends the dom element
[04:41:25] <madprops> i see
[04:41:31] <madprops> i can see how that library im using can be improved
[04:41:42] <madprops> (which i made so im gonna improve it rite now)
[04:41:54] <Cork> avoiding converting things to string is normally a good thing ya
[04:42:05] <Cork> it isn't always possibly though (ex for template engines)
[04:50:06] <madprops> awesome it works
[04:50:30] <Cork> madprops: moving the click handler is better from other points of views too
[04:51:23] <Cork> cause each event handler you add to the dom makes it slower, so if you can make one event handler handle all those elements it will make things faster (and if you go above say a few hundred event handler, it will be visibly noticeable difference)
[08:15:51] <TheWild> hello
[08:16:58] <TheWild> https://kopy.io/74Xh6 - this code doesn't work. I'm getting "TypeError: b.pattern is undefined" in jquery.mask.min.js. Is there something that I'm obviously doing wrong?
[08:18:57] <localh0st> http://igorescobar.github.io/jQuery-Mask-Plugin/docs.html#translation
[08:18:59] <localh0st> TheWild:
[08:19:51] <TheWild> oh, I missed that this is an object, not just a string. Thanks localh0st.
[08:49:54] <jquery820> hello! can some jquery guru help me detect a click on element which inside iframe, outside ? https://jsfiddle.net/q4aa3/55/
[08:51:15] <jquery820> i'm really frustrated with jquery when it comes to iframes :(
[08:51:18] <Woet> jquery820: what makes you think thats possible?
[08:51:21] <Woet> jquery820: why are you using iframes?
[08:51:40] <jquery820> the page that i need to detect element of doesn't actually belong to me, so that's why iframe :(
[08:51:52] <jquery820> i need to detect when user presses "close" button :(
[08:52:25] <Woet> [14:51:17]  <Woet>	jquery820: what makes you think thats possible?
[08:54:29] <jquery820> Woet: on that matter, what makes you think it's impossible?
[08:54:39] <Woet> jquery820: because basic security?
[08:54:49] <jquery820> client side?
[08:54:53] <Woet> jquery820: yes.
[08:54:57] <jquery820> hmmm.
[08:55:13] <jquery820> well that's both nice and bad. nice that i don't have to work to solve it anymore, bad that i still need some solution
[08:55:15] <Woet> jquery820: let me just load gmail.com in an iframe and bind to the onchange password field.
[08:55:41] <jquery820> that's exactly what i will quote to my costumer
[08:55:45] <jquery820> thanks mate
[09:53:24] <poboy> When I add alert('here');  the alert pops up on mouseleave.  but as is, #controlSidebar does not get clicked.  https://kopy.io/ENRjl
[09:53:27] <poboy> Any thoughts?
[09:56:21] <iaj> Hi! I dunno if thats the right place to ask but maybe someone can help me, when I got a .mp4 video on my webserver and want to have it being played on a webpage without the possibility of getting ripped/stolen -- how could I achieve that?

[10:17:14] <pranesh> how to solve uncught reference error: $ is not defined
[10:20:36] <taplar> iaj: you might ask #web as that's pretty off topic for the room.  though I will say making something completely unstealable is pretty much impossible
[10:21:10] <taplar> taken to the extremes, a user can download freeware desktop capture software to record your video for themselves.
[10:21:58] <taplar> less of an extreme there are browser plugins to capture and save certain kinds of streaming video too
[10:23:54] <poboy> How can I select any <a> tags in the ul class="control-sidebar-menu" ??
[10:24:21] <taplar> select the ul class, then find the a's off of it
[10:29:30] <poboy> hmm, this doesn't select i https://kopy.io/jjopE
[10:29:49] <poboy> syntax error?
[10:32:29] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/vnj01La7/  works fine
[10:39:11] <iaj> taplar: thanks! yeah did that already :( was hoping for here.
[11:09:05] <zer0python> I have a select2 object where I am hooking into the change event, anyway, as part of this I need to update the val() call depending on what was selected, the issue I'm seeing is that apparently I need to call the change trigger in order to update the display of select2.. I'm worried doing this would basically end up in a loop. Does anyone know the correct way to handle this?
[11:09:51] <taplar> select2 should have an api method to set the value
[11:10:53] <taplar> https://select2.org/programmatic-control/add-select-clear-items
[11:11:00] <taplar> which apparently -is- using val() and calling change()
[11:11:05] <taplar> that's weird
[11:12:07] <zer0python> indeed.
[11:12:33] <taplar> so if you want, trigger() will allow you to provide optional parameters to the event
[11:12:47] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[11:13:08] <taplar> so you could trigger change, giving it extra parameters you can check to know to skip any logic you want to avoid the loop
[11:13:21] <zer0python> taplar: that's an excellent idea, thank you
[11:33:27] <hellyeah> yo
[11:46:21] <taplar> morning
[12:56:04] <ckb> hey guys, how do I disable the iOS elastic effect on a scrollable element?
[13:02:54] <Al_nz1> I am trying to understand, at a high level how I should go about pagination / search / datatable. So far I see that datatables docs says 50,000 records to client is OK - wow. but what about if you have a dataset that has 200,000 records, then yourdata tables need to talk to backend for each query?
[13:03:27] <taplar> datatables has the option for pagination with ajax calls
[13:04:04] <Al_nz1> taplar: yes I see that, but let me rephrase it
[13:05:36] <taplar> https://www.datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/server_side/server_side.html
[13:05:43] <Al_nz1> is pagination designed as a way for a user to go through pages of results - which could number in the hundreds or even low thousands, but shouldnt ever go as high as 10's of thousands?
[13:05:52] <taplar> no
[13:05:56] <taplar> well
[13:06:11] <taplar> there's not a single design for 'pagination'
[13:06:13] <taplar> it's a concept
[13:07:00] <taplar> it's up to you to determine what implementation is usable and benificial to the users
[13:07:01] <Al_nz1> taplar: yes, but if your sending 10's of thousands of results to a table - the user is never going to paginate throught it - right?
[13:07:10] <taplar> maybe they will
[13:07:12] <taplar> idk
[13:07:18] <taplar> you have to determine the use case
[13:07:30] <Al_nz1> poor user who has to trawl through that
[13:07:35] <taplar> sure
[13:07:45] <taplar> imo i agree with you
[13:07:51] <taplar> but that doesn't rule out all use cases
[13:09:46] <taplar> in the case of that link i shared, from my understanding of it, it's not returning the thousands of records.  just the subset it is displaying each time
[13:10:10] <taplar> 10/25/50/100, chosen by the user
[13:10:21] <taplar> who is more apt to decide how many they want to see
[13:11:37] <Al_nz1> yes, with serverside they only see 25,50,100 at a time - but the total records or even pages could number in the hundreds is ridiculous - you never page through that much
[13:12:03] <taplar> so then it sounds like you need additional filters
[13:13:50] <Al_nz1> so far in my design when users log in, depending on role, they land on what I am calling a dashboard, but its really a table page, where they can select, as an example, sales, people, tasks. For sales this will already be restricted to area and open sales, so numbers even after several years should only be in thousands. People on the other hand could hit 10,000 or even 100,000 - so pagination,
[13:13:51] <Al_nz1> while it could be made to work serverside - is the wrong approach? since it would be bad design? thats kinda what I am asking? and if not pagination then what? search?
[13:14:27] <taplar> you'll have to page most likely
[13:14:32] <taplar> the key though is the filtering
[13:14:39] <taplar> give them options to reduce their result set
[13:14:46] <taplar> that will be meaningful to them
[13:15:46] <taplar> if data can be multi year, give them the option to see by year
[13:15:59] <taplar> if many people, maybe search by a single person
[13:16:01] <taplar> etc.
[13:16:13] <taplar> it's whatever makes sense to the end user
[13:19:17] <Al_nz1> yeah I intend to put filtering in. but the inital result set when you hit the page (granted they wont trawl through it without filtering) could be a large number
[13:19:31] <taplar> so maybe not auto search until they filter?
[13:19:46] <taplar> or start off with the most granular search possible
[13:19:52] <taplar> let them expand it
[13:19:56] <taplar> lots of options
[13:20:34] <taplar> but the big point is, if you are going to take a big hit that they never use.  why do it?
[13:20:34] <Al_nz1> yeah for sales - thats easy since you can filter out closed etc
[13:20:50] <Al_nz1> but what do you do for people?
[13:20:59] <Al_nz1> they would want to see anyone
[13:21:16] <taplar> do they?
[13:21:24] <taplar> have you asked them?
[13:21:42] <Al_nz1> hmmm
[13:21:45] <taplar> :)
[13:22:12] <robertmaxrees> the question is how many results to show in DT, right?
[13:22:29] <taplar> pretty much
[13:22:40] <taplar> giving that the data set is 100k or larger
[13:22:55] <robertmaxrees> always do server-side pagination with larger datasets.
[13:22:56] <robertmaxrees> imo
[13:23:19] <robertmaxrees> and never show more than 100 per page.  also: google doesn't let you browser more than the top 1000 results in a set iirc.
[13:23:27] <robertmaxrees> might be 10,000
[13:23:33] <robertmaxrees> pretty sure it's 1 tho.
[13:23:39] <taplar> the max we ever do is 500, and the user has to choose that
[13:24:09] <taplar> 'we' being the things i've worked on
[13:24:27] <robertmaxrees> ^ yeah.  if your dataset is that large, manual browsing through that result set is kind of excessive.
[13:24:31] <robertmaxrees> people wanna filter down.
[13:24:42] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: thats kinda what I am asking - pagination (even with server side processing) isnt a great idea when your results set it huge 10,000+
[13:24:53] <taplar> why not?
[13:24:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:25:03] <robertmaxrees> ^^^ why isn't pagination a good idea?
[13:25:27] <robertmaxrees> you aren't reducing the result set in the application, are you?
[13:25:35] <taplar> ^^^
[13:25:45] <taplar> you reduce in the server
[13:25:52] <robertmaxrees> in the DB, ideallyu.
[13:26:23] <robertmaxrees> that's what it's for :)
[13:26:35] <taplar> i think i'm confusing what you mean by 'result set'
[13:26:51] <taplar> are you calling the total number of db records as the result set, or after the filter?
[13:27:05] <taplar> @Al_nz1
[13:27:34] <Al_nz1> taplar: result set is the total number of records available for pagination before filtering - ie when use first lands on page
[13:27:41] <taplar> so no
[13:27:46] <taplar> you're result set is after filtering
[13:27:59] <taplar> that's what result set means, :)
[13:28:05] <taplar> the resulting set after the operation
[13:28:22] <Al_nz1> taplar: but when user first lands on page no filtering is applied
[13:28:27] <taplar> so don't auto search
[13:28:36] <taplar> i've already talked about htat
[13:28:41] <Al_nz1> have page empty when user lands there?
[13:28:45] <taplar> or use a default filter that will limit the results
[13:29:13] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[13:29:24] <robertmaxrees> you can give them a capped result set.
[13:29:37] <robertmaxrees> show them a paginated set of the first 1000 or w/e
[13:29:44] <robertmaxrees> but don't send all that data to the client.
[13:29:56] <Al_nz1> taplar: yeah I am trying to think of a default filter for people - it could be something like involved in a case in the last year or something
[13:30:10] <taplar> with a message "Showing # of ####.  Change filter to see more."  or something
[13:30:40] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: datatables says its good for 50,000 in client which is amazing
[13:30:56] <robertmaxrees> *up to*
[13:30:57] <taplar> it will work, doesn't mean work well
[13:31:02] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[13:31:13] <robertmaxrees> let your server handle that workload when possible.
[13:31:16] <taplar> and the size of results is hardly constant
[13:31:28] <taplar> 2 colums, 10 columns, 50 columns
[13:31:31] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: I am, and planning for that now :)
[13:31:56] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 so then yeah, ignore what DT says about what it can handle heh
[13:32:22] <taplar> so how about this
[13:32:30] <taplar> people involved in cases
[13:32:41] <taplar> i can imagine a table with the alphabet above it
[13:32:52] <taplar> click the letter, it shows only people with last names starting with that
[13:33:05] <taplar> or something of the nature
[13:33:11] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:33:17] <Al_nz1> taplar: yeah but what would it show when the user first gets to that page?
[13:33:24] <robertmaxrees> anothe idea is to default to the last week or last month or w/e
[13:33:32] <Al_nz1> what I thought was only show people in open cases....
[13:33:37] <taplar> you could show the 'A' people
[13:33:48] <robertmaxrees> how many open cases are there at a time?
[13:34:13] <Al_nz1> maybe a few thousand max.
[13:34:28] <robertmaxrees> how far back do those open cases go?
[13:34:29] <taplar> sounds like going down the right track towards a good default search
[13:34:50] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: maybe 1 year in a few situations
[13:35:01] <Al_nz1> I should end up with something UI like this : http://jsfiddle.net/s8F9V/27/
[13:35:03] <robertmaxrees> but would a month be a sensible default?
[13:35:53] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: no - open would be more sensible
[13:36:03] <taplar> open + last month
[13:36:10] <Al_nz1> maybe open+region
[13:36:16] <taplar> lol
[13:36:53] <taplar> ideally you should find out from the users why they are going to this page the most
[13:37:11] <taplar> what information are they after
[13:37:26] <Al_nz1> depends on role
[13:37:31] <taplar> ok, so do it by role
[13:37:45] <Al_nz1> I will filter by role and for some thats easy
[13:38:03] <taplar> i'm not saying filter by role, or that's not what i meant
[13:38:08] <Al_nz1> for SUPER_USER and ADMIN - a bit harder since they could be after anything
[13:38:11] <taplar> i meant find out what each role is going to the page for
[13:38:19] <Al_nz1> taplar: i know
[13:40:00] <taplar> you work in a lawfirm?
[13:40:19] <Al_nz1> taplar: close but not quite
[13:40:27] <taplar> pretty cool
[13:40:39] <Al_nz1> other side of the fence
[13:40:55] <taplar> law enforcement?
[13:41:02] <taplar> or do you mean judicial
[13:41:33] <taplar> or the mofia..... :O
[13:41:38] <Al_nz1> law enforcement, but more in the social services sector
[13:41:57] <Al_nz1> helping people in bad relationships etc
[13:41:58] <taplar> ah
[13:42:39] <taplar> brb
[13:43:07] <Al_nz1> k

[14:51:06] <taplar> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#method-destroy
[14:51:13] <shakes808> and i am trying to add in a checkbox to work with
[14:51:16] <taplar> you may want to call destroy before you initialize it
[14:51:28] <taplar> otherwise there may be cached data that is lingering causing you issues
[14:51:58] <taplar> this is if you are going to do this initialization every time
[14:52:03] <taplar> *that
[14:52:55] <shakes808> the way this site is set up isn't very optimized.  :(
[14:53:22] <shakes808> trying to get it to work, sorry for the delay
[14:53:27] <taplar> are you seeing the logs from the create method every time it opens?
[14:53:53] <shakes808> when i run it locally, i see them once.  the second time through, it doesn't
[14:54:05] <taplar> yeah, i'm thinking cached plugin data
[14:54:08] <taplar> try the destroy thing
[14:54:17] <shakes808> alright
[14:54:29] <shakes808> just like it is in my snippet; sans commented out
[14:55:49] <shakes808> adding that seemed to work
[14:55:57] <shakes808> it shows up all the time now :)
[14:56:11] <shakes808> taplar: thank you
[14:56:17] <taplar> sure
[14:56:31] <shakes808> is there a way to not cache it or optimize that bit of code?
[14:56:44] <taplar> caching by the plugin is the optimization
[14:56:57] <taplar> it shouldn't re-initialize something it's already made, :)
[14:57:08] <taplar> but you are destroying the body with the html setting
[14:57:12] <taplar> but the plugin doesn't know that
[14:58:48] <shakes808> Are you referring to the first two lines of $('dialogue-confirm).hide() and ...unbind()
[14:58:59] <taplar> yep, the hide().html(....)
[14:59:39] <shakes808> That is the way all of these are in the file....  *.hide().html()
[14:59:59] <shakes808> so all of these could potentially have this issue
[15:00:05] <taplar> potentially
[15:00:23] <shakes808> 24 references to that
[15:00:23] <taplar> if they remember that you've initialized on an element before and skip it for future calls, like this one appears to
[15:01:06] <shakes808> probably wouldn't hurt to put that `destory` portion on all 24 references?
[15:01:20] <taplar> i would suggest re-considering if you need to do that
[15:01:48] <taplar> brb
[15:02:50] <shakes808> like i mentioned earlier, my js / jquery -foo is lacking.   I will talk our front end guys to see what they say.
[15:50:52] <`ULT> Hello, is there a way to write this shorter/ better? https://jsfiddle.net/mtxkwy8L/
[15:51:20] <robertmaxrees> a few ways.
[15:51:29] <`ULT> when screen is > 651 px > default behaviour
[15:51:40] <robertmaxrees> first off - any reason you can't do this with CSS?
[15:51:43] <`ULT> when screen is less, full width search and change position
[15:51:49] <robertmaxrees> and just hide/show things as appropriate?
[15:52:02] <`ULT> I need to change the element, and unfurtunately I cant make a duplicate from the search
[15:52:11] <`ULT> so i can hide/ show with css
[15:52:48] <robertmaxrees> any reason you can't have the two versions on the page tho?
[15:52:49] <`ULT> I know resize handler is not good practise
[15:53:04] <robertmaxrees> the reason is you're doing some pretty heavy-handed operations in there.
[15:53:32] <`ULT> Oke thanks robertmaxrees, that is what I wanted to hear. I try to figure a way to make two versions of the searchbox
[15:53:38] <`ULT> resize is pretty bad or not?
[15:53:44] <robertmaxrees> really bad.
[15:53:48] <robertmaxrees> especially with what you're doing.
[15:53:59] <robertmaxrees> partially because it fires so many times when invoked.,
[15:54:16] <`ULT> I would like to trottle/ debounce this when it is working
[15:54:23] <`ULT> throttle
[15:54:26] <robertmaxrees> that's not all tho.
[15:54:35] <robertmaxrees> you also need to store all selectors outside of the handler.
[15:54:51] <`ULT> but I think the if else is also poor written
[15:54:58] <robertmaxrees> and you should set a state boolean outsiude, as well, to know when to actually to the .after / html.
[15:55:14] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise you're making the browser do a TON of work.
[15:55:24] <`ULT> you mean this also outside the handler:   $(".row_NlSzq") ?
[15:55:33] <robertmaxrees> any call to $()
[15:55:50] <robertmaxrees> $(window), $(".row_NlSzq"), and $("#HeaderSearchSystem_OsyDl0G1")
[15:56:09] <`ULT> oke, why is that so heavy inside a handler?
[15:56:16] <`ULT> everytime a jquery call?
[15:56:26] <`ULT> after every resize event?
[15:56:36] <robertmaxrees> jquery spawns a new object every time you call $().  resize fires a lot of times super fast.
[15:56:49] <robertmaxrees> why query the document for elements more than once?
[15:57:15] <robertmaxrees> in general, you don't want to call $() more than once for each element you need.  not just for resize handlers.
[15:57:16] <`ULT> that is right, so it is better to store in a variable outside the handler?
[15:57:30] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[15:57:34] <`ULT> Oke thanks, when I make a var from it you wont call it again?
[15:57:43] <robertmaxrees> you use the var.
[15:57:47] <`ULT> Didn`t know that.
[15:57:49] <robertmaxrees> the var stores the result of $()
[15:57:55] <robertmaxrees> which doesn't call $() again
[15:58:01] <robertmaxrees> it's like any other function.
[15:58:11] <`ULT> Oke, sounds clear indeed :)
[15:58:17] <robertmaxrees> but really.
[15:58:33] <robertmaxrees> the best way to do this is to just have both versions on the page and hide/show bnased on screen size.
[15:59:13] <`ULT> Yes oke, I will try to get that working. The auto search is broken when I make a duplicate from it. But I think I can make this work.
[15:59:42] <`ULT> I was also not very happy bymyself with the resize handler
[16:00:13] <`ULT> what do you mean by this? and you should set a state boolean outsiude, as well, to know when to actually to the .after / html. ?
[16:00:44] <robertmaxrees> so right now, you're going to fire the branches of the conditional, right?
[16:00:53] <robertmaxrees> regardless of whether or not you need to.
[16:00:57] <`ULT> yes
[16:01:22] <`ULT> and that`s not good I think.
[16:01:25] <robertmaxrees> and because you're moving things around the DOM, that's pretty bad.
[16:01:31] <`ULT> indeed!
[16:01:50] <`ULT> And how can I prevent this with a boolean?
[16:01:57] <`ULT> check if element exist?
[16:02:07] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:02:08] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:02:30] <robertmaxrees> make a boolean called something like var needsChange = false;
[16:03:02] <`ULT> and change the value in the condition?
[16:03:16] <robertmaxrees> right, and only change the condition when you've crossed your threshold.
[16:04:04] <`ULT> Allright, and execute the final action outside the condition?
[16:04:12] <`ULT> or even outside the event handler?
[16:04:24] <robertmaxrees> uh
[16:04:28] <robertmaxrees> then it won't fire on resize heh.
[16:04:29] <`ULT> If that is possible
[16:04:39] <robertmaxrees> you'll just check that state var and if it's true, fire the handler.
[16:04:54] <`ULT> aah yes. before the resize handler the if else
[16:05:15] <robertmaxrees> right.  just make sure you're checking the sta3te of that var firstr.
[16:05:17] <robertmaxrees> *first
[16:05:37] <`ULT> Oke thanks robertmaxrees, that makes alot clear :)
[16:05:54] <`ULT> I will try to make another version
[16:05:54] <robertmaxrees> but put effort into the css solution first ;)
[16:05:58] <`ULT> yes!
[16:06:27] <`ULT> That`s what I will doing :)
[16:07:18] <robertmaxrees> rad
[17:22:37] <taplar> fry day, fry day, gotta get down, it's fry day
