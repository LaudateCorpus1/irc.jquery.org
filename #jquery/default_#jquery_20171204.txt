[04:51:51] <Aquazi> anybody knows why $(selector).find("*").removeAttr("attr1 attr2");
[04:52:02] <Aquazi> doesn't removes the attributes in the entire document?
[04:53:28] <Aquazi> it works with a single attr, but not more than one
[05:02:34] <FilipNortic_> Aquazi: remoeveAttr renoves 1 attr with the name "string" were did you read you could use selector syntax in there?
[05:03:32] <FilipNortic_> Ahh wait your right they added that
[05:03:50] <FilipNortic_> which jQuery version do you have?
[05:04:33] <Aquazi> not really using jquery but a server side implementation of it called cheerio
[05:04:42] <Aquazi> I think it's simply not ported from jquery
[05:04:57] <Aquazi> so I went for concatenating .removeAttr
[05:05:21] <Aquazi> $(selector).find("*").removeAttr("attr1").removeAttr("attr2");;
[05:07:50] <FilipNortic_> Aquazi: well asking questions of spesifics is not really usefull if you're in an other laguage check the docs/ source code of the framework you're using instead
[05:09:18] <Aquazi> FilipNortic_,
[05:09:26] <Aquazi> that implies understanding the source code :D
[05:09:43] <Aquazi> I just thought there was something wrong with my jquery syntax
[05:11:17] <Aquazi> but now it simply seems their port of jquery didn't include this option
[05:11:56] <FilipNortic_> if they ported from jQuery pre 1.7 there you coudn't do that
[05:17:38] <Cork> Aquazi: the problem is that you think of it as jquery syntax, it isn't
[05:17:51] <Cork> it's a jquery based syntax
[05:18:04] <Aquazi> what you mean Cork
[05:18:17] <Cork> it isn't using jquery, or part of jquery
[05:18:35] <Cork> it is a completely separate implementation basing it of a specific version of jquery
[05:18:47] <Cork> meaning it really doens't have any relation to jquery
[05:19:02] <Cork> and is why ppl keep directing you to ask them about syntax errors
[05:19:15] <Cork> as, it isn't jquery so don't treat it as jquery
[05:19:49] <Aquazi> well, that's the first time I couldn't solve a problem treating it differently than jquery, because one thing wasn't implemented
[05:20:09] <Aquazi> their docs too often recommend you reading jquery docs for more details
[05:20:40] <FilipNortic_> with out givning version of jQuery... That seems evil
[05:37:39] <Cork> ya...
[05:38:10] <Cork> if they just had a wrapper around jquery i would say it was fair, but for a reimplementation, not so much
[06:23:44] <raid3n`> poste CDI dev web sur montreuil (93) dispo
[06:48:31] <Aquazi> let's say I have <div><a><b></b></a></div> and <div><a><b><c>foo</c></b></a></div> how can I remove <a> elements that do not cointain a <c> child or grandchild or grand grandchild, ecc?
[07:03:28] <FilipNortic_> not in any oneline i think
[07:05:12] <FilipNortic_> an each loop and a condition checking  $(this).find('c').length comes to mind
[08:54:35] <thykka> $('a').filter((i, e) => {return $(e).children('c').length == 0}).remove()
[08:54:37] <thykka> or such..
[08:56:31] <thykka> https://jsfiddle.net/uyj8pw4f/
[08:56:35] <thykka> Aquazi, ^
[08:57:07] <Aquazi> thx ill check asap
[09:01:45] <Cork> thykka: or you could do $('a').not($('c').closest('a')).remove()
[09:02:04] <Cork> Aquazi: ^ too :)
[10:44:41] <Aquazi> let's say I have <a></a> <a><b></b></a> how do do I select the <a>s that don't have the b children?
[10:47:35] <thykka> Aquazi, you should be able to deduce that based on the answers given earlier
[10:48:08] <Aquazi> tried them, failed :D
[10:48:18] <Aquazi> i'll try again
[10:49:15] <thykka> it's literally a one letter change to Cork's snippet..
[10:51:37] <Aquazi> went for $("a").not(":has(b)")
[10:51:39] <Aquazi> seems to work
[10:52:07] <Aquazi> Cork's example was returning me all the objects matching a, for some reason
[10:52:18] <Aquazi> regardless of them having or not b
[10:59:24] <stevooo> Is there any specific channel where i can chat about general frontend development?
[11:01:57] <Aquazi> ##frontend
[13:17:40] <Aquazi> how do I unwrap till a specified element?
[13:18:41] <Aquazi> like <p><a><b><c><d>foo</d></c></b></a></p> to <p><d></d></p>
[13:18:44] <Aquazi> for each element
[13:18:51] <Aquazi> that is <d>
[13:20:54] <robertmaxrees> hum.
[13:21:26] <robertmaxrees> i'd almost argue against "unrwapping" and just construct the new element that you actually wnat.
[13:21:28] <robertmaxrees> *want
[13:22:35] <Aquazi> Kind of okay I guess
[13:22:49] <Aquazi> I'll think about it a bit
[13:22:56] <robertmaxrees> tho i gotta ask.
[13:23:14] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing so much dom manipulation there?
[13:23:29] <Aquazi> there, where?
[13:23:44] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to remove three separate elements.
[13:23:48] <robertmaxrees> *wrapping elements.
[13:24:38] <Aquazi> because I'm trying to simplify my document, but it's mostly for learning
[13:25:00] <robertmaxrees> i'd simplify it from the server to start with heh.
[13:25:08] <robertmaxrees> instead of trying to "fix" it with JS.
[13:26:05] <Aquazi> it's a bit more complicated than that, regardless i'm mostly trying to learn manipulation
[13:26:15] <Aquazi> *dom manipulation
[13:26:37] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:27:58] <robertmaxrees> i'd focus time on learning how to properly do dom manipulation instead of contrived examples, but alright
[13:31:38] <robertmaxrees> Aquazi no need to PM :)
[15:34:04] <Jonuz> Chromium seems to redownload image everytime I clone it to another element. Any idea how to prevent this? https://paste.debian.net/999107/
[15:34:51] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're setting your caching headers correctly and it shouldn't actually hit the server.
