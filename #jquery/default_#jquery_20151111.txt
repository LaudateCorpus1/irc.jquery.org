[01:09:50] <cjohnson> sdwrage: yes it does
[01:09:59] <cjohnson> sdwrage: http://jsfiddle.net/hdjpzLyq/1/
[01:13:17] <Cork> cjohnson: why not just do e.target == this?
[01:13:42] <cjohnson> I wasn't sure how jquery handled this in the evnet of bubbling
[01:13:45] <zizzl> Hey all, how can I use custom images for a checkbox?
[01:13:52] <Cork> cjohnson: http://jsfiddle.net/hdjpzLyq/2/
[01:13:53] <cjohnson> guess it always refers to the bound element?
[01:13:54] <zizzl> Css solutions aren't working
[01:14:05] <cjohnson> what about delegated events Cork same deal there?
[01:14:14] <Cork> cjohnson: yes, same as native event handlers
[01:14:27] <cjohnson> $(document).on('submit', 'form.foo')  will be the form?
[01:14:27] <Cork> cjohnson: same it is the one element the delegate selector matches
[01:14:32] <Cork> yes
[01:14:34] <cjohnson> cool
[01:14:39] <cjohnson> event handlers have no defined spec for this
[01:14:42] <cjohnson> afaik
[01:14:45] <cjohnson> native ones
[01:14:49] <Cork> it does
[01:14:56] <cjohnson> the browsers just sort of do it anyway
[01:14:59] <Cork> no
[01:15:03] <cjohnson> link?
[01:16:18] <cjohnson> that may be something semi-recent. last time I checked it wasn't spec
[01:17:51] <Cork> cjohnson: you would have to read the spec for how browsers are suppose to trigger event callbacks
[01:17:57] <Cork> i don't have a link
[01:18:07] <Cork> but remember it isn't the spec for users of the api
[01:18:16] <Cork> it is the spec for how to implement it
[01:18:21] <cjohnson> the DOM spec right
[01:18:31] <Cork> there are two of those
[01:18:41] <cjohnson> last I read it wasn't. but I haven't read the latest version of DOM. I'll give it a look later on
[01:18:59] <cjohnson> and afaik in delegated events with native code this will definitely be document, not the form
[01:19:28] <Cork> no
[01:19:37] <Cork> target for delegated event is the delegate target
[01:19:43] <Cork> your thinking of live events
[01:19:44] <zizzl> Anyone?
[01:20:06] <Cork> zizzl: use a label and set the image in there
[01:20:11] <cjohnson> Cork: in native handlers I'm talking about
[01:20:11] <Cork> then hide the checkbox
[01:20:19] <Cork> you can't change the design of checkbox elements
[01:20:31] <Cork> cjohnson: native handlers don't have delegated
[01:20:38] <sdwrage> cjohnson, thats backwards
[01:20:43] <sdwrage> I need the parent not the child
[01:20:48] <Cork> cjohnson: delegated event handlers is just about taking bubbling events
[01:21:14] <cjohnson> http://jsfiddle.net/9fc9ytrm/
[01:21:18] <cjohnson> this = document
[01:21:25] <cjohnson> so anyway I just try to avoid this
[01:21:34] <Cork> cjohnson: ya, cause you bound to document
[01:21:41] <cjohnson> right, delegated event in native handler
[01:21:44] <Cork> cjohnson: that isn't equiv to delegate
[01:21:46] <cjohnson> whereas jquery will alter it
[01:21:50] <Cork> that is equiv to live
[01:22:04] <cjohnson> $(document).on('submit', 'form', ...
[01:22:09] <cjohnson> that's what I'm comparing to
[01:22:29] <Cork> ya, but again you don't have delegated in native js
[01:22:33] <Cork> it is normal event handlers
[01:22:40] <cjohnson> right, this is how you'd implement it
[01:22:45] <cjohnson> and the result is that this is not the element
[01:22:48] <cjohnson> so that's why I avoid this
[01:22:49] <Cork> no
[01:22:54] <cjohnson> well, it is
[01:22:58] <cjohnson> I'm not going to argue with you about it
[01:22:58] <Cork> ah, read the on code
[01:23:02] <Cork> i don't have time for this
[01:23:24] <Cork> sdwrage: http://jsfiddle.net/hdjpzLyq/3/
[01:23:31] <cjohnson> https://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate
[01:24:01] <Cork> cjohnson: ok, i will say this one more time
[01:24:13] <Cork> native js don't have a concept of delegated event handlers
[01:24:26] <cjohnson> right, and the article I just linked is *how* you do delegated event handlers
[01:24:26] <Cork> you can use bubbling event handling
[01:24:32] <cjohnson> and when you do that, this is not the form
[01:24:33] <Cork> but that is not the same
[01:24:34] <cjohnson> it's the document
[01:24:37] <Cork> but that is not the same
[01:24:39] <cjohnson> ergo, I avoid this
[01:24:41] <Cork> but that is not the same
[01:24:45] <Cork> ok?
[01:24:54] <cjohnson> you asked, I answered
[01:24:59] <Cork> no you didn't
[01:25:09] <cjohnson> 01:13 < Cork> cjohnson: why not just do e.target == this?
[01:25:14] <cjohnson> that's where you asked
[01:25:20] <Cork> delegated is say "use this element as the event source and delegate these event listning to this handler"
[01:25:22] <cjohnson> and the last 2 minutes are where I answered
[01:25:29] * cjohnson shrugs
[01:25:33] <Cork> and again native js doesn't have this concept
[01:25:37] <cjohnson> ok, if you say so
[01:25:41] <cjohnson> pedantry
[01:25:44] <Cork> it is a jquery implementation ontop of event bubbling
[01:25:52] <cjohnson> I'm not talking about jquery
[01:25:56] <sdwrage> okay ill try it
[01:25:57] <Cork> and it does change what this element is returned to the handler
[01:26:01] <cjohnson> yes, in jquery
[01:26:01] <Cork> cjohnson: yes you are
[01:26:05] * cjohnson yawns
[01:26:08] <cjohnson> good night
[01:26:19] <Cork> ya, come again when you've gotten some sleep
[01:26:23] <cjohnson> LOL
[01:26:25] <Cork> might be less circle talking
[01:26:28] <cjohnson> quit being such an argumentative prick
[01:26:38] <Cork> sigh...
[01:26:41] <Uhkis> man, if only i had popcorn
[01:26:52] <Cork> cjohnson: well you should learn the concepts before arguing...
[01:27:05] <cjohnson> done.
[01:27:07] <cjohnson> now move on
[01:27:09] <cjohnson> get over it
[01:27:15] <Cork> heh
[01:27:21] <Cork> man your a prick...
[01:27:32] <cjohnson> irony
[01:30:26] <Cork> cjohnson: about the "this" value here is the spec https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dispatching-events
[01:30:29] <Cork> point 6
[01:30:37] <Cork> (in invoke)
[01:30:38] <sdwrage> oh the lack of vocal and facial inflection :P
[02:35:49] <zizzl> Anyone using MailChimp have any ideas on how to utilize jQuery to make a popup showup for the confirmation message.. They allow redirecting to a url
[02:38:24] <robhol> This may be as huge an anti-pattern as I suspect, but... is it possible to combine the effects of noscript and meta-refresh? :p ie. "if you don't support JS, go here instead", or do I just need to provide a link
[02:41:29] <Cork> robhol: you can, but it is normally considered user hostile
[02:41:51] <Cork> robhol: it is normally better to just have a small banner stating javascript is needed
[02:41:56] <Cork> instead of changing the url for users
[02:42:22] <Cork> else the user has to fight with the redirect to actually get the page as they enable javascript
[02:42:29] <robhol> ah, I see.
[02:42:55] <Cork> (and this is why most systems to selectively enable javascript ignores noscript tags)
[02:44:30] <Cork> so the most compatible solution is to have something like <h3 id="nojs">Javascript is needed for this page to work properly</h3><script>$('#nojs').remove()<script>
[02:45:04] <Cork> robhol: ^
[02:45:39] <robhol> I haven't really excluded the idea of "graceful degradation" yet, but it may take some shifting stuff around
[02:49:01] <hellyeah> i will ask when you clkick arrow button you see width of div is expranded but height of div is narrowed. I want to order button according to width and height of div. Is is javascript issue or css issue? what do you think?  http://jsfiddle.net/2omfq5xj/257/
[02:51:03] <Cork> robhol: that warning is still a good idea
[02:51:23] <Cork> though the wording might want to change depending on how much gets lost
[02:51:27] <robhol> Well, I think I can make it work properly without JS too
[02:51:44] <Cork> well then a "for best experience" :)
[02:52:12] <robhol> I'm actually using it for navigation, so in terms of "degrading" user experience, it's no worse than simply writing actual links and intercepting the event in JS to do the fancy stuff :p
[02:58:50] <Cork> robhol: well for example here i do ajax loads for the page change
[02:58:57] <Cork> it means the pages switches faster
[02:59:10] <Cork> that is the kind of "best experience" i talked about :)
[04:10:11] <hellyeah> hey
[04:10:30] <hellyeah> i am sorry for simple question but what is wrong in line 41. It didnt hide the button http://jsfiddle.net/2omfq5xj/274/
[04:12:39] <Xatenev> hellyeah: it does
[04:12:45] <Xatenev> hellyeah: you just dont see it :p
[04:12:52] <hellyeah> humm
[04:12:55] <Xatenev> hellyeah: caues the button is immediately replaced with another
[04:12:56] <hellyeah> :XD
[04:13:01] <hellyeah> aha
[04:13:05] <hellyeah> xD
[04:14:16] <hellyeah> yes
[04:14:29] <hellyeah> sorry http://jsfiddle.net/2omfq5xj/277/
[04:14:44] <hellyeah> i guess i should use duration
[04:15:48] <hellyeah> thats nice !!!! http://jsfiddle.net/2omfq5xj/279/
[04:16:39] <hellyeah> btw easing is the animation method right
[04:20:02] <hellyeah> Xatenev: hide or fadeOut ?
[04:20:26] <Xatenev> hellyeah: for what
[04:20:42] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:20:48] <hellyeah> for hiding the button
[04:20:58] <hellyeah> here is example http://jsfiddle.net/Palpatim/qjSr6/
[04:21:22] <hellyeah> seems hide and fadeout do same thing here
[04:22:48] <Xatenev> hellyeah: not to me
[04:22:56] <Xatenev> fadeOut fades the element out while hide removes it from right to left
[04:23:04] <Xatenev> (Just what I can see in chrome)

[07:31:30] <hellyeah> in line 29 i try to add id of button that was hided and push id to the array. Then i check array is empty or not. In case array is not empty that means one of button is clicked already. And i try to show button by using array index. I try to guarantee array has just one element by doing array is null outside if.  dunno what i should do in line 36.

[07:32:41] <taplar> the event 'input'

[07:34:09] <taplar> ah
[07:35:54] <taplar> hellyeah: when would line 33 ever be false?
[07:37:37] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:38:08] <hellyeah> it is false when any button is not clicked
[07:38:23] <taplar> you get to that function by clicking a button
[07:38:27] <hellyeah> other time it is true
[07:38:46] <sql9928> Hello, I have multiple divs with the same CLASS. Some of these divs are completely empty. How would I go about hiding the empty divs? Note that divs WITH content still have the same classname.
[07:38:56] <hellyeah> my aim is to wipe the array when another button is clicked
[07:39:09] <hellyeah> idArr = null is in wrong place it seems
[07:39:10] <taplar> sql9928: filter on the ones whose val().trim().length < 1
[07:39:23] <taplar> err, html() instead of val()
[07:39:34] <Trinity> if I have $(".left-menu").on('click', function () { $(".left-menu-contents").toggle(); }); is there a way for me to only target the .left-menu-contents that are inside of the clicked left-menu element?
[07:39:58] <taplar> .left-menu .left-menu-contents
[07:40:02] <hellyeah> taplar: do you understand my aim?
[07:40:13] <taplar> <parent> <nested-child>
[07:40:25] <sql9928> taplar: would I have to loop trough each individual div? Since every div is dynamically generated.
[07:40:27] <taplar> kinda, fix your if
[07:40:38] <taplar> filter() will do the loop for you
[07:40:44] <taplar> sql9928: ^
[07:40:45] <sql9928> Oh lord
[07:40:56] <hellyeah> filter()
[07:40:57] <sql9928> I have never heard of filter as of yet, thank you!
[07:40:59] <taplar> or hide it when it is created
[07:41:08] <Trinity> taplar, it's not working :/
[07:41:37] <taplar> $(".left-menu").on('click', function () { $(this).find(".left-menu-contents").toggle(); });
[07:41:38] <Trinity> I have multiple menus that may contain submenus
[07:41:57] <taplar> sorry, misunderstood
[07:43:58] <Trinity> taplar, still not working
[07:44:26] <taplar> hmm, i'd need to see a fiddle.  that last snipplet should only find the contents in the clicked left menu
[07:44:58] <Trinity> taplar, nvmd found the error
[07:45:16] <Trinity> it was in my html it wasn't in the li on top of the ul :P
[07:45:27] <taplar> :)
[07:45:29] <Trinity> thanks. is find() the goto way to find an element inside of another element?
[07:46:01] <taplar> find() is similar to $(selector) but that you give it the context to operate off of instead of the whole dom
[07:46:45] <Trinity> ah, thanks :)
[07:46:56] <Trinity> i've seen something online about >
[07:47:14] <Trinity> like $(".someClass > .someOtherClass") what does that do?
[07:47:24] <taplar> it not only helps you reduce down what your wanting to get, but using it also helps you scope down your dom searches so they can be faster
[07:47:34] <compact> hey. i have if (row.find('input[name^="truck_cap"]').val() == '0') { which works
[07:47:46] <compact> now how can i get the id of truck_cap. so the "name" is truck_cap[15]
[07:48:10] <Trinity> I see, i've also seen $(".someClass") > $(".someOtherClass") which syntax should I use?
[07:48:12] <taplar> compact: you can do either prop('id') or attr('id') off of the object
[07:48:23] <taplar> uh
[07:48:34] <compact> I've tried alert(row.find('input[name^="truck_cap"]').attr(id));
[07:48:35] <compact> but no dice
[07:48:35] <taplar> you mean $('.class1 > .class2') ?
[07:48:49] <Trinity> I guess that ones correct then
[07:48:54] <Trinity> yea i've seen them both on a stackoverflow post
[07:49:04] <taplar> using > in a selector is a direct descendent operator
[07:49:11] <taplar> so you only search one level deep
[07:49:33] <taplar> so it just depends on the use case
[07:50:02] <taplar> compact: row is a jquery object yes?
[07:50:39] <compact> yes
[07:50:40] <compact> var row = $(this).closest('td');
[07:50:49] <taplar> compact: and what is the id variable?
[07:51:06] <taplar> if it's not a variable your missing '' around it
[07:52:13] <sql9928> Thank you taplar! That did the trick!
[07:52:27] <taplar> cool
[07:53:09] <hellyeah> taplar: did you understand my question? :D
[07:53:22] <taplar> hellyeah: i was waiting on you to fix your if conditional
[07:53:31] <hellyeah> ops
[07:53:36] <hellyeah> sorry
[07:53:49] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:54:22] <hellyeah> when you click buton is hidden and i add id of hidden button to the array i check array is empty or not is it false?
[07:56:06] <hellyeah> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/2omfq5xj/316/
[07:57:30] <taplar> afk for a bit
[08:06:00] <taplar> k, your still checking against not null
[08:06:07] <taplar> when would it be null?
[08:07:36] <hellyeah> well
[08:07:57] <hellyeah> when any of button isnt clicked array is null
[08:08:48] <taplar> look at your logic
[08:08:55] <taplar> when would you run that if and it would be null
[08:09:21] <hellyeah> ohh
[08:09:22] <hellyeah> sorryü
[08:10:00] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/2omfq5xj/322/
[08:10:04] <hellyeah> kinda stupid i am
[08:10:59] <taplar> your conditional is still doing nothing
[08:11:28] <taplar> your creating the array in your function and setting it to an empty array.  it will never be null with your current logic
[08:11:58] <taplar> setting it to null at the end doesn't do anything for you as it is scoped to the function so it goes away each time
[08:12:09] <taplar> -and- even if it didn't your initializing it each time
[08:12:38] <hellyeah> you are right
[08:13:50] <hellyeah> i couldnt get used to function system of js
[08:13:57] <hellyeah> it is invooked automatically
[08:14:01] <hellyeah> i am confused sometimes
[08:16:10] <hellyeah> does it seem logical now? http://jsfiddle.net/2omfq5xj/325/
[08:17:25] <hellyeah> i need to take some fresh hair
[08:17:26] <hellyeah> brb
[08:19:59] <taplar> nope, still a local array that will never be null
[08:29:55] <taplar> hellhttp://jsfiddle.net/2omfq5xj/330/
[08:31:00] <robhol> heh.. writing Javascript with Mako templates from Python. This feels slightly wrong. :p
[08:32:34] <taplar> brb
[09:41:27] <hellyeah> taplar: i am sorry for leaving. I needed a some fresh hair. That seems "if" is working also idArr has one element everytime.  check out the console http://jsfiddle.net/2omfq5xj/334/
[09:42:10] <taplar> i linked a modified version if you missed it
[09:42:34] <hellyeah> i missed that sorry if you linked again i will be greatful
[09:43:16] <taplar> it was #330
[09:45:34] <hellyeah> hmmm thank yopu
[09:48:29] <iateadonut> what is the event when the blinking cursor is in an input box?
[09:48:46] <taplar> didn't know that was an event
[09:49:05] <taplar> other than 'focus', but it doesn't fire with each blink
[09:49:34] <iateadonut> well, i'm trying to make a box appear when there is a hovering mouse OR if the cursor is in the box.
[09:49:50] <taplar> mouseover and focus
[09:50:04] <hellyeah> taplar: butt.show will understand each button is hidden right?
[09:50:17] <taplar> hmm?
[09:50:19] <iateadonut> cs_wrap_results.css('width', cs_display_field.outerWidth())[ e.type == 'mouseover' || e.type == 'focusin' ? 'show' : 'hide' ](); -- that's not working for me.  neither is 'focus'
[09:50:25] <hellyeah> may be i meantion wrong
[09:50:45] <taplar> $(selector).on('mouseover focus', function(){});
[09:50:50] <hellyeah> when you type buttonClasses.show() will it find hidden button automatically?
[09:51:09] <taplar> it tries to show them all
[09:51:20] <taplar> to the ones that are already shown it doesn't do anything
[09:51:49] <hellyeah> ic
[09:52:00] <hellyeah> hmm i just tried to one hidden one
[09:52:03] <hellyeah> and show it
[09:52:46] <hellyeah> dont get me wrong i just rrespected what you did what you did teach me
[09:52:54] <hellyeah> but i try to dig my way to learn more
[09:53:28] <hellyeah> i just did my thing here but there is something missing may be i should follow your way thanks. I just want to show what i did here http://jsfiddle.net/2omfq5xj/340/ if you care to look,
[09:55:10] <taplar> what's the point of the array?
[09:56:08] <hellyeah> well i just try to put the id of button array and show that spesific id from the array. But it seems it doesnt work correwctly
[09:56:24] <hellyeah> array just come to my mind to keep id of hidden button
[09:56:44] <taplar> that's what your doing with the array
[09:56:59] <taplar> what i'm asking is what problem are you trying to solve by using the array like that
[09:57:09] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:57:34] <hellyeah> i just think it is necessary to know which id is necessary to make button visible
[09:57:49] <taplar> but it's already visible
[09:57:53] <hellyeah> when you click another button just show that button with its id
[09:57:58] <taplar> ok
[09:58:06] <hellyeah> when you click it is hidden right
[09:58:08] <taplar> so your wanting to use the array to know what button was previously hidden
[09:58:14] <hellyeah> $(this).hide()
[09:58:45] <hellyeah> taplar: correct thats the way i thought of. dont get this disrespectful to you
[09:58:56] <taplar> no i'm trying to make your talk out your logic
[09:59:06] <taplar> so two questions
[09:59:09] <hellyeah> thank you
[09:59:16] <hellyeah> process of learning
[09:59:21] <taplar> 1) do you need the id?  why not store the object itself?
[09:59:24] <hellyeah> you are helping me god bless you
[09:59:33] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:59:41] <taplar> 2) how will a local array that is created and destroyed inside the function do that for you?
[09:59:59] <hellyeah> well
[10:00:02] <taplar> and 3) why do you need an array?  seems like it's a single element
[10:00:11] <hellyeah> 1- i didnt know storing object in array is possible
[10:00:26] <taplar> you can put anything in an array
[10:00:29] <taplar> why couldn't you?
[10:00:36] <hellyeah> 2 - i though js's code is interpreter one by one
[10:00:43] <hellyeah> so first going to if and do stuff
[10:00:48] <hellyeah> then destroy the array
[10:00:58] <hellyeah> i did that to guarantee array has just one element
[10:01:03] <taplar> your missing my point with #2
[10:01:07] <taplar> it's a local array
[10:01:14] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:01:14] <taplar> it's destroyed after the function is done
[10:01:17] <taplar> brb
[10:01:28] <hellyeah> ah
[10:01:34] <hellyeah> i got it what you meant now
[10:01:51] <hellyeah> it can be global array
[10:02:08] <hellyeah> but global variable is bad it was meantioned to me time to time
[10:06:06] <iateadonut> so is there a way to tell if the focus has left?
[10:06:41] <hellyeah> focus has left
[10:06:47] <hellyeah> i dont understand
[10:07:53] <HyP3r> hey all. I'm using jQuery and jQuery Mobile, I'm justing wondering why the Page Ttile is sometimes is changing. Does someone knows the reason why?
[10:09:32] <hellyeah> wondering is it possible to use jquery mobile in jsfiddle?
[10:18:35] <taplar> back
[10:19:19] <hellyeah> hey
[10:19:31] <taplar> global variables are not bad, just not always necessary
[10:19:31] <hellyeah> it can be global array
[10:19:38] <hellyeah> humm
[10:19:49] <taplar> and you can scope them down usually in namespaces
[10:19:49] <hellyeah> i can use global array in this case ?
[10:19:56] <taplar> again, why do you need an array?
[10:20:02] <taplar> it's a single element no?
[10:20:21] <hellyeah> actually yes array is not necessary
[10:20:29] <hellyeah> single element is handy here
[10:21:03] <taplar> so scope your variable to the document ready and use it
[10:22:35] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/2omfq5xj/357/
[10:23:10] <hellyeah> this is what i did i guess right
[10:23:21] <hellyeah> btw i heard Ecma script 6 has const
[10:23:24] <taplar> ok, and do you need the id?  when you could store the element
[10:23:43] <hellyeah> humm
[10:23:49] <hellyeah> well i can store element
[10:24:17] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/2omfq5xj/358/
[10:24:17] <taplar> what's the benifit of storing the element and not just the id?
[10:24:36] <hellyeah> well
[10:24:41] <hellyeah> i started thinking about it
[10:24:55] <hellyeah> well
[10:25:17] <hellyeah> i assigned element to the variable just single element
[10:25:35] <hellyeah> when i do $(idArr).show();
[10:25:43] <hellyeah> it will just hidden button
[10:25:46] <hellyeah> is that right?
[10:26:10] <Ice_Strike> When the page load, I want to trigger to click on the button, it dont seem to work?
[10:26:11] <Ice_Strike> $("#monitoringReportBtn").trigger("click");
[10:26:42] <hellyeah> Ice_Strike: you should fiddle it
[10:26:44] <taplar> Ice_Strike: make sure that script is either at the bottom of your page, or in a document ready.  and make sure the selector is valid
[10:27:29] <taplar> hellyeah: i think your getting it.  though if you store it already wrapped in jquery you don't have to wrap it for the show() call
[10:27:32] <Ice_Strike> Ah, I added in a js file
[10:28:12] <taplar> Ice_Strike: that's fine.  just if the include is not at the bottom of the page and the logic is not in a document ready it will execute before the body is rendered and won't find the element
[10:28:22] <Ice_Strike> I see
[10:28:32] <taplar> so if it is at the top, just put it in a ready
[10:30:38] <hellyeah> taplar: dont i need this? http://jsfiddle.net/2omfq5xj/360/ anyway it doesnt work
[10:31:08] <taplar> 'this' ?
[10:31:51] <taplar> btw, your hiding it and then showing the same element
[10:32:14] <hellyeah> op
[10:32:15] <hellyeah> s
[10:32:33] <hellyeah> i am sorry i am kinda sick
[10:32:38] <taplar> np
[10:32:45] <hellyeah> well same element
[10:32:58] <hellyeah> i have to show hidden element
[10:33:25] <hellyeah> so may be  $('.buttonClass[style*="display: none"]').show()
[10:34:09] <hellyeah> no
[10:35:39] <taplar> i gotta step away for a bit.  got office stuff going on
[10:35:47] <taplar> but think about this hellyeah
[10:35:57] <hellyeah> okey
[10:36:03] <hellyeah> taplar: last effort i did
[10:36:04] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/2omfq5xj/362/
[10:36:06] <taplar> the stored variable is expected to be the last hidden element prior to the button click
[10:36:08] <hellyeah> have a good day
[10:36:12] <taplar> but it may be the first click
[10:36:16] <taplar> so consider that
[10:39:21] <EmmaBourbon> Hello, I was hoping someone might be able to help me
[10:39:42] <EmmaBourbon> i try to load my website and it just continues to load,
[10:39:57] <EmmaBourbon> the jquery isn't connecting. I'm unusre why. What i'm doing wrong.
[10:40:40] <sigdk_> EmmaBourbon, F12 if you 're using chrome and check at console tab for possible error messages
[10:41:57] <sigdk_> to the rest... I'm using validate to check user's input at a form. After he does a mistake, a popup msg appears on top of the fieldl. How can I close it whenever I click back to edit the field ?
[10:47:03] <EmmaBourbon> i've googled this error message before and i couldn't figure it out,
[10:47:05] <EmmaBourbon> Uncaught SecurityError: Failed to execute 'replaceState' on '
[10:47:43] <slax0r> dude, you're gunna have to be more descriptive
[10:47:51] <slax0r> exact error message, on what file, etc
[10:47:56] <EmmaBourbon> Uncaught SecurityError: Failed to execute 'replaceState' on 'History': A history state object with URL 'file:///D:/INFO2500%20Dynamic%20Web%20Applications/Classwork/New%20folder/index.html' cannot be created in a document with origin 'null'.
[10:48:09] <slax0r> and best of all, try to re-create the exact same error on jsfiddle
[10:48:17] <EmmaBourbon> that's the error messag,e sorry. idk how to show you. okay. let me try that brb
[10:55:04] <EmmaBourbon> well thats interesting
[10:55:20] <EmmaBourbon> when i run it in jsfiddle it runs when i click on the jquery stuff on the side,
[10:55:25] <EmmaBourbon> but i have that already linked in my code,
[10:56:03] <EmmaBourbon> i think i just need to tinker with it a little bit or something. this is quite frustrating.
[11:02:47] <EmmaBourbon> It only works with this linked jQuery Mobile 1.3.0b1
[11:02:54] <EmmaBourbon> how do i get that into my code,

[11:16:51] <Germanaz0_> hello everybody, somebody knows the name of this kind of plugins ? I can't find on google this kind of widgets http://i.imgur.com/dg4fVRY.png
[11:16:57] <Germanaz0_> because I don't know the kind of name of it
[11:18:29] <Xatenev> Germanaz0_: what do u wnana use it for
[11:18:29] <Xatenev> ?
[11:18:51] <Germanaz0_> Is the same as image, I want that to choose  a progress
[11:19:08] <Germanaz0_> I have the minus and the plus link, and I need to increase/decrease those bars
[11:20:30] <Xatenev> Germanaz0_: dont think u will find a real plugin for that
[11:20:40] <Xatenev> Germanaz0_: you typically dont set the progress urself :P
[11:20:43] <Xatenev> Germanaz0_: http://demo.tutorialzine.com/2013/10/buttons-built-in-progress-meters/
[11:20:46] <Germanaz0_> I just need the progress with steps, that division
[11:20:47] <Xatenev> maybe something into that direction
[11:20:53] <Xatenev> http://tutorialzine.com/2013/10/buttons-built-in-progress-meters/
[11:21:06] <Xatenev> there u have an increment button
[11:21:16] <Xatenev> which is basically exactly what u want, now just change the loading bar layout
[11:21:46] <Germanaz0_> yes the thing is that I don't matter a lot the action buttons, I am searching more for the steps divisions inside
[11:21:53] <Germanaz0_> inside the progress bar
[11:22:01] <Germanaz0_> but that link is usefull to get an idea :DF
[11:22:17] <Xatenev> Germanaz0_: I would just make 6 images
[11:22:22] <Xatenev> Germanaz0_: and replace them dependent on the step..
[11:22:33] <Xatenev> Germanaz0_: so onclick change image source to step2.png
[11:23:38] <Germanaz0_> yes, makes sense
[11:55:53] <sigdk_> in this example: http://jqueryvalidation.org/maxlength-method/   does the "field" refer to ?  the id of the input or the name ?
[11:56:52] <robertmaxrees> http://jqueryvalidation.org/jQuery.validator.addClassRules/
[11:56:57] <robertmaxrees> relevant to what you're looking for.
[12:03:33] <sigdk_> I didn't get it...
[12:04:24] <Xatenev> sigdk_: what stops u from just trying it out?
[12:05:11] <Xatenev> sigdk_: its the name
[12:05:13] <Xatenev> sigdk_: btw
[12:05:23] <Xatenev> sigdk_: as you can see in this example: http://jqueryvalidation.org/category/methods/
[12:05:25] <sigdk_> Xatenev, thanks
[12:05:35] <Xatenev> sigdk_: (see Work_phone and work_phone)
[12:17:18] <notchris> Can I search an Object in the console for strings?
[12:30:16] <MrTopless> How to easily redelegate missing functions on ajax loaded html, without knowing which function are missing like for example. $(data.html).scanForMissingDelegations({})
[12:30:41] <MrTopless> $(data.html).scanForMissingDelegations({ bindIfFound: true });
[12:30:53] <MrTopless> Is there such thing in jquery world developed?
[12:32:55] <taplar> notchris: what do you mean?
[12:35:13] <taplar> MrTopless: not sure what your asking.  html returned from an ajax call would not have any delegations applied to it until it was appended to an element that did have them applied
[12:35:41] <MrTopless> http://www.learningjquery.com/2008/05/working-with-events-part-2
[12:36:11] <MrTopless> There is something written here, but doesn't say about ajax html content return, can I copy events binded to the html from the target url?
[12:36:39] <taplar> if you use delegates you don't have to
[12:37:05] <taplar> that's one of the main points for delegation.  content can change.  the events bubble up to a preexisting parent for the evaluations
[12:37:54] <MrTopless> taplar, the thing is I can't delegate
[12:38:35] <MrTopless> Because target js doesn't exist in the callers directory.
[12:39:03] <taplar> are you saying your getting the js from the ajax  call?
[12:39:47] <MrTopless> taplar, I would like to get js from the html retrieved. But not the whole rubbish, only the required and binded one.
[12:40:32] <MrTopless> taplar, the clone(true), does what I need, but how do I clone, urls html?
[12:41:00] <taplar> urls html?
[12:41:27] <MrTopless> taplar by that I mean the source html found at specific url.
[12:41:38] <taplar> that you retrieve from an ajax call
[12:42:23] <MrTopless> taplar, okay, I do ajax, I get the html, but its useless, because its has no events binded.
[12:42:27] <taplar> no, i'm asking
[12:42:34] <MrTopless> taplar, yes.
[12:42:49] <taplar> ok, is the url returning a complete page?
[12:43:34] <MrTopless> taplar, it can, but I use .load, so I specify exact container. So I wouldn't get head and other unnescessary html, but I need events as well.
[12:44:12] <taplar> right, good.  ok, so what you will probably want to do is have the js that is pulled in with the html do the binding once it's appended to the body
[12:44:32] <taplar> otherwise you could include that js already on the page, and once the html is loaded from that ajax and appended, invoke it
[12:45:33] <MrTopless> taplar, okay, how do I write load function, to fetch my container div only and as well required js for that containers elements?
[12:46:17] <taplar> so if it's already included on the page it would just be a normal function
[12:46:28] <taplar> fetching the container div is going to depend on the classes/id you put on it/them
[12:47:54] <MrTopless> $("#myWizard").on('show.bs.modal', function(event){ $(this).find('.modal_body').load('www.example.com #iNeedThisDIv', function(data){  /* how do I get the required js? */ }) })
[12:48:24] <taplar> make a fiddle, it's hard to read in chat
[13:02:36] <MrTopless> taplar, its not fetching target data: http://jsfiddle.net/dx1df36q/1/ because of Access-Control-Allow-Origin. But
[13:03:27] <MrTopless> You can test same over here: http://vezejai.tk/vezejai-2/juslintek/profile/
[13:03:35] <MrTopless> Press Naujas >
[13:04:09] <MrTopless> So thing is I can't simulate my problem on jsfiddle
[13:04:17] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem you're having?
[13:05:45] <MrTopless> I don't know how to bind js on ajax returned html, if I don't have the target javascripts.
[13:05:57] <robertmaxrees> do what now?
[13:06:06] <robertmaxrees> like, you want to bind a listener?
[13:06:08] <robertmaxrees> ooor...?
[13:06:17] <MrTopless> redelegate
[13:06:22] <MrTopless> or clone(true)
[13:06:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:06:29] <robertmaxrees> "redelegate"?
[13:06:33] <taplar> :)
[13:06:36] <robertmaxrees> you're talking about event listeners?  or what?
[13:07:00] <MrTopless> robertmaxrees, event listeners and construction of new objects, depends on target url.
[13:07:12] <robertmaxrees> construction of what objects?
[13:07:17] <robertmaxrees> i think you're conflating things.
[13:07:30] <taplar> load() takes an optional function as a second parameter that is executed when the load is done.  you can do your binding in there
[13:07:32] <robertmaxrees> for event listeners, you use the delegated syntaxt of .on() and bind to a parent element that always exists.
[13:07:43] <MrTopless> well new html, custom triggers, trigger binding, event binding...
[13:07:52] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating things.
[13:08:07] <MrTopless> what does word conflating mean?
[13:08:27] <robertmaxrees> you're combining topics.
[13:08:41] <taplar> optionally you could delegate bind on $('#universalModal') since that appears to be a pre-existing element
[13:08:58] <robertmaxrees> i assume you have event handlers you want to re-bind, as well as widgets you want to reinitialize, right?
[13:09:17] <MrTopless> robertmaxrees, no I don't
[13:09:24] <robertmaxrees> MrTopless then what do you want to do?
[13:09:44] <robertmaxrees> give me some sample code you want to "re-run"
[13:09:51] <MrTopless> I want to make ajax query, to target url, get the target html and all events binded to it.
[13:10:00] <robertmaxrees> there are no events bound to it.
[13:10:05] <MrTopless> like clone(true), does.
[13:10:26] <robertmaxrees> right, if you're ajaxing in content, there are no bound listeners to the new content.
[13:10:30] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation instead.
[13:10:45] <robertmaxrees> don't re-bind your listeners.
[13:11:16] <MrTopless> but event delegation requires javascript functions to be present.
[13:11:29] <robertmaxrees> you're not loading the js in through the ajax calls are you?
[13:12:03] <MrTopless> robertmaxrees, no I don't know how to filter them out and return and make work in returned html.
[13:12:43] <robertmaxrees> you need to fix your server to only return the relevant HTML.
[13:12:46] <robertmaxrees> not html AND javascript.
[13:13:26] <MrTopless> robertmaxrees, but I get only html, that is the thing, I want to get source js as well and init() it.
[13:13:52] <robertmaxrees> so for event listeners, put those into your normal JS file(s) and use delegation.
[13:13:56] <robertmaxrees> that way you don't reinitialize anything.
[13:14:11] <MrTopless> But I don't want to get head of document, don't want to get random script and style clutter, just want the relevant js which is bound to the html I get.
[13:14:24] <robertmaxrees> that's not a good way to do that.
[13:14:37] <robertmaxrees> you're not using .load() to grab specific parts of other pages, are you?
[13:15:06] <MrTopless> robertmaxrees, yes I'm using load
[13:15:14] <robertmaxrees> to grab specific parts of other pageS?
[13:15:25] <MrTopless> robertmaxrees, yes.
[13:15:41] <robertmaxrees> fix your server then to have endpoint(s) that return the specific markup you need.
[13:15:52] <robertmaxrees> then fix your JS files to include all the code you'll need.
[13:16:00] <robertmaxrees> instead of trying to dynamically load/execute JS.
[13:16:02] <MrTopless> robertmaxrees, but I get the specific markup I need.
[13:16:24] <robertmaxrees> right, after downloading an entire other page.  you're actually adding a punch of unnecessary overhead there ;)
[13:16:36] <MrTopless> I just want as well javascript to scan through markup and head of the target url. And find binded script and get it as well, then run it.
[13:16:47] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to work.
[13:17:00] <robertmaxrees> your current problem is easily resolved - genericise your JS and include it everywhere potentially needed.
[13:17:37] <MrTopless> robertmaxrees, Yeah if you want to clutter your markup with rubbish and stuff.
[13:17:43] <MrTopless> And make it heavy.
[13:17:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:17:48] <robertmaxrees> you don't put anything in your markup.
[13:17:53] <taplar> unexecuted js isn't heavy
[13:17:53] <robertmaxrees> you put it in a javascript file.
[13:18:02] <MrTopless> Well I can include it in modal, but it will weight 100kb more.
[13:18:10] <robertmaxrees> you're not generating javascript using like php right?
[13:18:19] <MrTopless> robertmaxrees, no.
[13:18:36] <robertmaxrees> and that's how you do that.  100kb sounds like you need to clean up your JS and minify/gzip it.
[13:19:23] <MrTopless> And I thought there is some tools or function which would fetch the markup, and all bound scripts and run it.
[13:19:26] <MrTopless> Dang :-(
[13:19:35] <robertmaxrees> nope, and that's a really bad architecture.
[13:19:58] <MrTopless> robertmaxrees, not in my case, when I need that only for few pages.
[13:20:27] <robertmaxrees> yes in your case.
[13:20:31] <robertmaxrees> ajax is great for fetching data.
[13:20:44] <robertmaxrees> not for fetching data AND logic.
[13:20:57] <robertmaxrees> also, if you're so concerned about page weight, what you're doing now is a nightmare.
[13:20:58] <MrTopless> So how to fetch logic?
[13:21:10] <robertmaxrees> you don't - you put it in your JS and have it ready on pageload.
[13:21:24] <robertmaxrees> browser caching is an awesome thing.
[13:21:57] <MrTopless> robertmaxrees, well thats bad and sux a lot. Because a lot of out of the box thinkers thing otherwise, that fetching logic with data would be just awesome.
[13:22:14] <robertmaxrees> it's really not awesome.
[13:22:19] <robertmaxrees> fetching ajax should never also fetch logic.
[13:22:28] <robertmaxrees> that's breaking your separations of concern big time.
[13:22:41] <MrTopless> Well now you have to prepare for the flight and that takes long. When you can just fly.
[13:22:50] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:22:52] <MrTopless> So I think just to fly and not prepare for it is more awesome.
[13:23:02] <robertmaxrees> that's not what you're doing in this case.
[13:23:33] <taplar> I'd rather have my flight algorithm worked out, and then conditionally load a plane to use in it
[13:23:41] <taplar> :D
[13:23:59] <taplar> weird analogy though
[13:24:08] <MrTopless> Then you would loose the chance to feel the adrenaline.
[13:24:12] <MrTopless> :-D
[13:24:32] <robertmaxrees> i'd personally rather use a plane that was built using our best understanding of aviation and rely on that instead.
[13:24:45] <robertmaxrees> but comparing webapps to flight is a little awkward in the first place.
[13:24:54] <taplar> i also don't want adrenaline when flying.  i was safety, :)
[13:25:01] <taplar> was=want
[13:25:02] <robertmaxrees> ^ exactly.
[13:25:04] <MrTopless> Okay, so one way or another, I have to preload the the js :-(
[13:25:16] <robertmaxrees> MrTopless why is that such a problem?
[13:25:47] <robertmaxrees> your entire page is much more than 100kb surely, and you're reloading the entire thing with every ajax call.  so why is loading 100kb of js an issue?
[13:25:53] <MrTopless> Because it takes a lot of time, to find the right functions, I don't know how to find functions which are bound to markup.
[13:26:09] <johndoe2> Is anyone aware of a bug in newer versions of mobile Chrome where jQuery.("on" events gets triggered outside of the elements they were attached to?
[13:26:28] <robertmaxrees> johndev "outside"?  like, say, parent elements?
[13:26:36] <johndoe2> actually, mobile Safari exhibits the same behavior.
[13:26:49] <johndoe2> robertmaxrees let me check
[13:27:00] <taplar> MrTopless: you know what data your appending.  so you should know what event bindings should go with it.  how does it take a lot of time?
[13:27:19] <johndoe2> robertmaxrees yes, the whole page wrapper is a parent element
[13:27:29] <Zeranoe> is there a way to modify a scripts html using firefox and add a script that runs when deselecting the edit box?
[13:27:37] <robertmaxrees> johndev and the event binding to that parent element is what's firing?
[13:27:39] <robertmaxrees> because that's not a bug.
[13:27:41] <robertmaxrees> that's a feature.
[13:27:57] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe wat
[13:27:59] <MrTopless> its not written in source, that button1, has merrychristmas() binded to it.
[13:28:02] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe "a scripts html"?
[13:28:07] <johndoe2> robertmaxrees maybe I wasn't clear enough about it. I have a button which is in page, inside a <div id=
[13:28:23] <robertmaxrees> johndoe2 make a simplified fiddle maybe?
[13:28:26] <johndoe2> robertmaxrees and my listening event is on the button, not the page wrapper.
[13:28:44] <taplar> load('merry-christmas-url', function(){ /* bind merrychristmas to the newly loaded html elements */ });
[13:28:58] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: you can modify a pages HTML in firefox/chrome. when done editing the changes are viable on the page. If I add a <script></script> to the HTML, can i get it to run when done editing
[13:28:58] <taplar> ^ assuming your not doing delegates
[13:29:20] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe use your console for the js part.
[13:29:24] <johndoe2> robertmaxrees a simplified fiddle won't help here. If you want I can give you the URL, but you actually need a mobile device to test it on.
[13:29:46] <robertmaxrees> johndoe2 actually a simplified example WOULD help here.  that way i don't have to trudge through your entire site.
[13:29:48] <robertmaxrees> but sure.
[13:29:49] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:30:32] <johndoe2> robertmaxrees I see what you mean. Ok I'll make a fiddle and see if the behavior is the same.
[13:30:48] <johndoe2> although not quite the same thing with all the iframing and stuff.
[13:31:04] <robertmaxrees> similar enough,  events are pretty consistent.
[13:31:32] <johndoe2> it started happening after the last mobile browser update (2 updates ago)
[13:31:58] <johndoe2> so something must have changed again about webkit
[13:32:20] <robertmaxrees> sure, and they may/may not have fixed a bug internally.  or maybe your code made an assumption.  or maybe jquery is bugged.  or... could be all kinds of things.
[13:32:23] <johndoe2> as far as I know apple only allows webkit
[13:32:30] <johndoe2> true
[13:32:39] <robertmaxrees> yep, chrome for iOS uses webkit, not blink.
[13:33:05] <theskillwithin> if I have  a string   test=blabblah&test2=djklsdfjkldsafjklfdsa;&   ....     how do I select one of these values?
[13:33:16] <robertmaxrees> you mean a querystring?
[13:33:18] <taplar> split() it
[13:33:29] <robertmaxrees> and it depends - you can split it, or you can parse that into an object.
[13:33:47] <robertmaxrees> http://stevenbenner.com/2010/03/javascript-regex-trick-parse-a-query-string-into-an-object/
[13:35:15] <robertmaxrees> theskillwithin oh you're getting help in ##javascript.
[13:35:17] <robertmaxrees> nevermind then.
[13:35:34] <taplar> *tear* he's two timing
[13:35:42] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: so it cannot be done without running it through the console?
[13:36:08] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe i didn't say that.  i have no context for your question so i suggested the thing that makes the most sense to me.
[13:59:04] <WhirledPress> What would be the best way to handle this: I have an input field that requires a minimum length of 4 characters. I would like to show underscores for each required character missing.  so it would be J_ _ _ _   then JA _ _ _ and so on...
[14:00:36] <robertmaxrees> http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/ has an example.
[14:00:41] <robertmaxrees> you're looking for input masking.
[14:01:14] <WhirledPress> Brilliant. I know about input masking but  never thought about it in this context. Thanks for the reply.
[14:01:52] <Muhuil> http://jsbin.com/fanumuyeso/edit?js,output
[14:01:58] <Muhuil> how can I to do that?
[14:02:02] <robertmaxrees> do what?
[14:02:18] <robertmaxrees> Muhuil you're setting a variable there to an array.
[14:02:22] <robertmaxrees> not clear at all what you're confused by.
[14:02:28] <johndoe2> robertmaxrees yeah, I tried but on a mobile browser the content grows past and that's useless when testing http://jsfiddle.net/10h2c6xt/1/ I'll move it to a single page on a server.
[14:02:57] <robertmaxrees> johndev what was the bug?  even just looking at the relevant code can help in cases like thius.
[14:03:09] <robertmaxrees> err, jondoe2
[14:05:16] <johndoe2> hehe :) robertmaxrees the mobile browsers trigger events on the wrapper (any place in the page really) that are actually supposed to trigger on the buttons at the bottom of the page
[14:05:33] <johndoe2> I also have an android tablet and that does the same
[14:05:44] <robertmaxrees> there's a lot of code in there - what code specifically are you  looking at?
[14:05:44] <johndoe2> the behavior triggers randomly when scrolling up and down
[14:06:01] <johndoe2> the bottom buttons are all the code that's jquery
[14:06:23] <johndoe2> so next and prev h1, increase & decrease font size, and show/hide
[14:06:44] <robertmaxrees> what code are those triggering that they shouldn't?
[14:07:08] <robertmaxrees> also you have jquery loaded twice in that fiddle.
[14:07:09] <johndoe2> lines 14, 26, 37, 79 and 108
[14:07:11] <johndoe2> in JS
[14:07:44] <robertmaxrees> err.
[14:07:50] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:07:54] <johndoe2> yeah I tried to load 2.1.4 but it's not there
[14:08:06] <johndoe2> and forgot to remove it. hold up
[14:08:09] <robertmaxrees> re-describe the issue.
[14:08:35] <johndoe2> robertmaxrees load /2/ for just 2.1.4
[14:08:45] <johndoe2> Ok, let me try this again:
[14:09:00] <robertmaxrees> so i click bigger - what's happening that shouldn't happen?
[14:09:16] <Muhuil> robertmaxrees : http://jsbin.com/tehaxivona/1/edit?js,output
[14:09:20] <Muhuil> I need to do this
[14:09:24] <robertmaxrees> ,Uhkis
[14:09:34] <robertmaxrees> Muhuil huh?
[14:10:07] <robertmaxrees> Muhuil ask a question - your examples aren't making sense.
[14:10:33] <johndoe2> there are click and touchstart listeners on buttons at the bottom of the page. When I scroll the page those buttons act as if I tapped/clicked them at random times. It doesn't happen when I simply tap anywhere, but only when I scroll. This is a bug, obviously, since the spots where the tapping and sliding happens are inside the wrapper but clearly outside of the buttons, or, even the .bottombuttons
[14:10:43] <Muhuil> robertmaxrees : I need to exclude of the second array the elements whom id is equal to some value of first array
[14:11:05] <robertmaxrees> Muhuil make a more compresensive fiddle, then.
[14:11:22] <robertmaxrees> johndoe2 okay, so when scrolling on the page, even handlers bound to those buttons randomly fire?
[14:11:31] <robertmaxrees> *event
[14:11:34] <johndoe2> yes
[14:11:48] <johndoe2> only on a mobile device
[14:11:59] <johndoe2> desktop browsers (I tried everything I could get my hands on) are fine.
[14:12:11] <robertmaxrees> and chrome device emulation is fine?
[14:12:13] <Muhuil> robertmaxrees : there is ok, what I dont know is how can I to exclude them
[14:12:25] <robertmaxrees> Muhuil i see a single array and an $.each() call.
[14:12:32] <robertmaxrees> so no, that's not a complete example.
[14:13:32] <johndoe2> robertmaxrees emulation devices don't behave like a real device. I tried iOS simulator and android studio thingie and they work just fine.
[14:13:49] <johndoe2> however, any iOS device I tried, and an android 10.1 device I have here with me does the same thing
[14:13:56] <robertmaxrees> johndoe2 i'm aware of the differences, but verifying that can give clues about the bug.
[14:14:10] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you change the touchend handlers to use touchstart?
[14:14:13] <robertmaxrees> same thing?
[14:14:45] <johndoe2> I have played with that a lot because iOS devices send both a touch event and a click one, but the click one is random.
[14:14:58] <robertmaxrees> re-read what i said ;)
[14:15:06] <johndoe2> so the behavior is no good on touchstart, it triggers show/hide button twice
[14:15:08] <robertmaxrees> i didn't mention anything about touch or click, but touchstrt specific.
[14:15:19] <robertmaxrees> have you considered something like hammer then?
[14:15:28] <Muhuil> robertmaxrees :http://jsbin.com/xasuwusate/1/edit?js,output
[14:15:30] <Muhuil> is this man
[14:15:59] <robertmaxrees> Muhuil fwiw your "object" is still an array.  and you want to use indexOf()
[14:16:19] <johndoe2> robertmaxrees no I have not considered anything outside of jquery. :D
[14:16:36] <johndoe2> but if using a plugin is what I need, I'm ok with it
[14:16:44] <robertmaxrees> i'd give that a shot.
[14:17:04] <johndoe2> ok cool. thank you. :)
[14:17:51] <robertmaxrees> Muhuil http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yb2try1L/
[14:17:58] <robertmaxrees> simple stuff.
[14:18:02] <robertmaxrees> no jquery needed.
[14:18:54] <VectorX> hi my code https://jsfiddle.net/zc59pn7x/ , when the user scrolls up i want to chaggne the color of the box to orange but i want it to be depending on the speed/propotion of the scroll,  ie if you just scroll up once of the mouse wheel nothign would happen perhaps 30 piles or more, but how woudl i do that ?
[14:19:14] <robertmaxrees> VectorX look for plugins that detect scroll velocity maybe?
[14:20:22] <VectorX> woulddnt they be a simple modification to my code to be able to do that
[14:20:39] <robertmaxrees> to detect velocity?
[14:20:39] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:20:47] <robertmaxrees> velocity is kind of a hard thing to get right.
[14:20:57] <taplar> *waves hands* physics!
[14:21:27] <robertmaxrees> VectorX you need to detect how fast/long something happened.
[14:21:35] <VectorX> right
[14:21:48] <robertmaxrees> and then average that out in realtime.
[14:21:51] <robertmaxrees> that's a hard thing to get right.
[14:21:57] <robertmaxrees> so look for a plugin that handles that for you.
[14:22:20] <VectorX> ok
[14:23:07] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: huh?
[14:23:14] <robertmaxrees> sorry, accidentally tagged yo.
[14:23:16] <robertmaxrees> my bad.
[14:23:52] <Uhkis> oh, np
[14:24:44] <VectorX> is there is recomended online jquery custom build tool ?
[14:25:05] <robertmaxrees> nope - you can do it yourself locally though.
[14:25:11] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[14:26:14] <VectorX> reduce size
[14:26:20] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[14:26:23] <VectorX> ;)
[14:26:32] <robertmaxrees> are you gzipping?
[14:26:36] <VectorX> yeah
[14:26:58] <robertmaxrees> and every image is sized down, reduced quality, and compressed, right?
[14:27:07] <VectorX> yeah
[14:27:10] <robertmaxrees> then you're fine.
[14:27:26] <VectorX> just got page speed complaining about just that as renderblocking
[14:27:35] <robertmaxrees> i
[14:27:40] <robertmaxrees> *i wouldn't worry about that.
[14:28:09] <robertmaxrees> the initial 95k hit is ok - the user will then have it cached.
[14:31:47] * robertmaxrees yawns
[15:08:31] <Scriptonaut> hey guys, I'm not understanding something. When I execute this line of code in the console: $('#tab_content > :not([style*="display:none"]):last-child').css("display"); It returns "none"
[15:08:57] <Scriptonaut> am I using it wrong? I'm explicitly trying to *not* select children with display: none
[15:09:05] <robertmaxrees> because you're not matching anything.  you need *:not(asfasdfasdf
[15:09:09] <robertmaxrees> but don't do it that way.
[15:09:13] <Scriptonaut> ah
[15:09:16] <Scriptonaut> how should I do it?
[15:09:16] <robertmaxrees> use .children() and .filter()
[15:09:23] <Scriptonaut> I'm doing it in css
[15:09:31] <Scriptonaut> I'm just using jquery to confirm why it's not matching
[15:09:43] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[15:09:44] <robertmaxrees> huh
[15:09:45] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:10:54] <taplar> does css() go against the calculated styling or only the style tag?
[15:11:10] <Scriptonaut> this is still returning "none": $('#tab_content > *:not([style*="display:none"]):last-child').css("display")
[15:11:25] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut this is why i avoid special selectors.
[15:11:32] <robertmaxrees> use .filter() and .children()
[15:11:44] <Scriptonaut> robertmaxrees: like I said, I'm doing this in css, there is no .filter()
[15:11:51] <Scriptonaut> I'm just using jquery to confirm
[15:11:53] <robertmaxrees> you're using jquery there.
[15:12:01] <Scriptonaut> in the console, to see why my css isn't matching
[15:12:03] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:12:04] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:12:12] <taplar> cause if the not check is checking the attribute and the ending css() is displaying the calculated value gotten from a class, then that would seem to match
[15:12:14] <robertmaxrees> none of that changes my suggestions.
[15:12:56] <Scriptonaut> ok, I have a container (#tab_content). I want the last *visible* child to have a padding-bottom of 20px, how do I do that?
[15:13:00] <Scriptonaut> I suppose this is a #css question
[15:13:06] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[15:13:28] <robertmaxrees> if you're using jquery, http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9fbrk29f/
[15:13:37] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, yeah head to #css.
[15:22:56] <lizard_> I have a stupid question... I know JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, etc. and have built a website that uses all of those plus PHP, mysqli, and now want to turn it into an app. Where can I find information on how to do that?
[15:23:10] <robertmaxrees> like a phone app?
[15:23:16] <lizard_> yes
[15:23:31] <robertmaxrees> really depends on how you want to go about that.
[15:23:43] <robertmaxrees> you can build apps using something like cordova or other similar tools.
[15:23:58] <robertmaxrees> but you're not really going to be able to just take your current code and plug it in somewhere and magically have an app.
[15:24:27] <lizard_> but to use cordova, it seems I have to use the cordova framework.
[15:24:39] <robertmaxrees> correct.  you could use any of the available options.
[15:24:46] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you could make a mobile-optimized site.
[15:25:04] <lizard_> Yes! that's what I'd like to do.
[15:25:14] <robertmaxrees> oh, so not an app.
[15:25:19] <robertmaxrees> look into responsive web design.
[15:25:27] <lizard_> I just transferred my site into the jQuerymobile framework
[15:25:27] <robertmaxrees> start there and expand.
[15:26:28] <lizard_> well, it's going to be distributed to specific customers of a business and should be available on their phones
[15:26:42] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[15:26:45] <robertmaxrees> back way up.
[15:26:56] <robertmaxrees> do you want a site that works on phones, or an app?
[15:27:01] <robertmaxrees> there's a distinction there.
[15:27:03] <lizard_> so don't want to just give them a url
[15:27:21] <robertmaxrees> do basic authentication for it.
[15:27:34] <lizard_> I can do a site that works on phones so I guess I want an app...
[15:27:36] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you'll need to start an app from scratch,
[15:27:42] <robertmaxrees> that's not an app.
[15:27:46] <robertmaxrees> an app would be something that you install.
[15:28:08] <lizard_> This is what happens when an old-time programmer tries to deal with new jargon. Sorry. Yes, an app that a person will install
[15:28:40] <robertmaxrees> then you'll need to build that separately.
[15:29:20] <lizard_> how can you use jQuerymobile to go from building the whole template into an installable app?
[15:29:26] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[15:29:28] <robertmaxrees> that's not what it does.
[15:29:36] <lizard_> oh. :-(
[15:29:48] <lizard_> back to Cordova, right?
[15:30:03] <robertmaxrees> that's one of many options.
[15:30:09] <robertmaxrees> or you could build it native.
[15:30:16] <robertmaxrees> or you could do a webview of some kind.
[15:30:26] <robertmaxrees> or you could use react native.  or or or... lots of choices.
[15:30:31] <lizard_> other options? native would require coding for all os's
[15:31:10] <robertmaxrees> react-native lets you reuse a decent amount of code.
[15:31:10] <lizard_> webview sounds interesting.
[15:31:18] <robertmaxrees> but correct, there's no write-once, run everywhere solution.
[15:31:37] <robertmaxrees> what would this app do?
[15:31:39] <lizard_> okay, will look into react-native and webview
[15:32:46] <lizard_> users enter their location and, to begin, it queries a db, gets locations of events in a given area during a specified time, and returns that info
[15:33:13] <lizard_> there will be more but same idea
[15:33:29] <robertmaxrees> i'd just make your stuff mobile friendly and put it behind some basic authentication.
[15:33:57] <lizard_> that's a good start
[15:34:00] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're going to spend a bunch of time writing and exposing APIs that need authentication and whatnot.
[15:34:38] <lizard_> this isn't going to be the next Candy Crush Saga :-) just geared toward a specific audience for a specific purpose
[15:34:54] <robertmaxrees> sure - that's why i'm suggesting the path of least resistance.
[15:35:35] <lizard_> thanks so much! Have a place to start now. You guys rock!
[15:35:44] <robertmaxrees> definitely.  thank you!
[15:38:41] <theskillwithin> this doesn't work? $('#ys_proceedContainer img').attr('src', 'http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/yhst-13171632195427/proceedToCheckout.jpg');
[15:38:42] <theskillwithin> all it does is return []
[15:38:42] <joeyplaid> Hey guys, I'm trying to pass an ID number to a modal, which will be used to pull data from a JSON-formatted dictionary. I'd like to get the ID number when the user clicks on the link to popup the modal.
[15:38:51] <joeyplaid> I can't figure out how to pass the ID number to the modal.
[15:39:22] <joeyplaid> I'm using jquery in conjunction with jinja2 templates. Does anyone have suggestions? I don't think my approach is any good.
[15:40:05] <theskillwithin> ah figured it out
[15:41:58] <robertmaxrees> joeyplaid no way for us to know without seeing an example or something.
[15:42:19] <joeyplaid> Sure. Let me pull up the file.
[15:42:41] <joeyplaid> <td white-space: nowrap>
[15:42:41] <joeyplaid>       <a class="getHistory" data="{{ orig_inc_id }}" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#eventHistoryModal" href="#">{{ incident['incident_id'] }}</a>
[15:42:47] <robertmaxrees> hey dopn't paste in the channel.
[15:42:56] <robertmaxrees> and which piece of data did you need?
[15:43:04] <joeyplaid> My bad.
[15:43:29] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle or something instead?
[15:43:34] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i go to lunch.
[15:43:36] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[15:43:42] <joeyplaid> Eh, yeah, let me do that.
[15:44:59] <joeyplaid> http://jsfiddle.net/ddymd2rm/14/
[15:45:21] <joeyplaid> I'm a big n00b with javascript/jquery and I am absolutely positive my approach is wrong-headed but I can't figure out the right way.
[15:53:09] <WhirledPress> joeyplaid, You should probably read a little about jquery, selectors, and event handling before you ask for help in #jquery. Though people here are nicer than other channels and more generous, it's not really appropriate to ask us to train you on the very basics...
[15:53:50] <WhirledPress> It is, however, a good idea to hang around and read what everyone else posts. You'll learn a lot that way.
[15:54:52] <joeyplaid> I'll hang around. I've done a good bit of research but I'm not grasping it.
[15:54:56] <joeyplaid> But I'll lurk.
[15:56:54] <WhirledPress> Cool. Here is the biggest thing you should probably know about jquery. At it's most basic, it's a way of searching the dom for elements. When you see $()its actually the same as JQuery(). I use the term "Select all elements that" and ad whatever is in parens.
[15:57:24] <WhirledPress> *basically, I'm painting with a broad brush here.
[16:02:39] <EmmaBourbon> interesting. i'm glad i came in for the ending here.
[16:03:36] <EmmaBourbon> I just found this channel today. Its interesting to say the least. JQuery is a lot of fun, when i can get it all figured out.
[16:04:07] <WhirledPress> I've been coming here for years and the folks here are so nice compared to other channels.
[16:09:11] <joeyplaid> WhirledPress: Thanks, that's helpful.
[16:09:35] <WhirledPress> joeyplaid, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/ddymd2rm/15/
[16:09:44] <WhirledPress> I made some notes for you.
[16:13:08] <joeyplaid> Fantastic, thank you.
[16:14:07] <joeyplaid> This is wonderful, I'm very grateful.
[16:23:18] <WhirledPress> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/ddymd2rm/16/
[16:24:05] <WhirledPress> no problem. Here are some more examples. These are not best practices, just demonstrations of some of the ideas behind jquery.
[16:26:56] <joeyplaid> Nice.
[16:43:25] <revolve> how do I operate on a tree that's not attached to window.document?
[16:45:03] <revolve> nevermind found the answer
[17:35:05] <VectorX> with jQuery(window).scroll how can you detect if it was a code based scroll or user scroll( ie with keyboard mousewhell, scrollbar of browser, touch based )
[17:37:22] <VectorX> ie, not have the box turn orange when you click the scroll up link https://jsfiddle.net/zc59pn7x/1/ scroll down a bit to see the link
[17:42:59] <ngharo> VectorX: not sure but you could do this https://jsfiddle.net/zc59pn7x/2/
[17:49:29] <VectorX> ngharo im sorry i added the animated just to slow things down for demonstration, its actually like https://jsfiddle.net/zc59pn7x/7/ with -50 being varying
[17:50:32] <ngharo> you could still achieve the same there
[17:51:05] <ngharo> your goal is to not change the div when clicking the link, right
[17:52:42] <VectorX> no, not change the div if scrolling occured via code
[18:31:03] <compact> $( 'input[name^="freight-qty"]' ).keyup(function() { <-- any idea why if freight-qty is cloned
[18:31:08] <compact> that keyup won't work
[18:33:18] <robertmaxrees> .on() only binds to things that exist at the time of binding.
[18:33:22] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener instead.
[18:34:06] <robertmaxrees> .keyup uses .on() under the hood.
[18:35:49] <robertmaxrees> compact
[18:37:42] <compact> right ok
[18:38:02] <compact> so .on is a delegated listener?
[18:38:06] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:38:09] <robertmaxrees> read the docs for more info.
[18:38:42] <compact> $( 'input[name^="freight-qty"]').on( "keyup", function() {
[18:38:52] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:39:00] <compact> ok looking
[18:39:25] <robertmaxrees> read the docs.  they even show an example that compares non-delegated against delegated.
[18:55:03] <zeroquake> Any idea why last-child psuedo selector doesnt work after width resize of element?
[18:55:16] <robertmaxrees> in css?
[18:55:33] <zeroquake> i have a table using dd , dt
[18:55:48] <zeroquake> i assign a background-color using last-child selector
[18:56:02] <zeroquake> on resize , i use jquery selector to update widths of elements
[18:56:09] <robertmaxrees> cna you share the code?
[18:56:16] <zeroquake> once this is done , psuedo selector no longer works
[18:56:37] <zeroquake> mm , let me see , this is kinda private
[19:11:34] <zeroquake> robertmaxrees, Example - http://codepen.io/anon/pen/MazdzR
[19:11:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:11:48] <robertmaxrees> where's the JS?
[19:11:55] <zeroquake> uncomment the js line , psuedo selector no longer works
[19:12:10] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so how do i replicate the issue?
[19:12:30] <zeroquake> uncomment the $("#DD_9").width(500);
[19:12:35] <robertmaxrees> i did.
[19:12:42] <robertmaxrees> then what?
[19:12:46] <zeroquake> when the width is changed , the yellow background-color goes away
[19:13:56] <robertmaxrees> so it's http://codepen.io/anon/pen/NGEVeB ?
[19:14:11] <robertmaxrees> if #DD_9 is 500 px wide, it disappears?
[19:14:57] <robertmaxrees> looks like it wraps to the left because it becomes too wide for its container but the height: 20px; on #DL_1 hides it.
[19:15:01] <zeroquake> yes , i guess when width of dd is greater than available widths it disappers
[19:15:17] <robertmaxrees> set #DL_1's height to 40 and you'll see what i mean.
[19:15:22] <zeroquake> yes , thank you , i just need to change the order in which am setting the widths
[19:15:46] <robertmaxrees> fwiw that was more of a CSS question, not a jquery question :)
[19:16:48] <zeroquake> True , it didnt occur to me it was wrapping , i was like is this an edge case with psuedo selectors
[19:16:51] <zeroquake> thank you.
[19:17:01] <robertmaxrees> psuedo selectors are still css :)
[19:17:30] <vrishab> Need some help on jquery DataTables. Please refer http://imgur.com/a/Rn7pq
[19:17:36] <zeroquake> :)
[19:18:02] <robertmaxrees> vrishab 2 things: 1) you'll get a lot more help on their forums. 2) screenshots are never helpful.
[19:21:35] <vrishab> robertmaxrees, ok .. I'll just post once .. my next stop will be their forums ..
[19:21:49] <robertmaxrees> vrishab do you have a fiddle or something?
[19:21:52] <robertmaxrees> what's your question?
[19:22:47] <vrishab> There are 4 images:   image1 ( All is ok with 10 rows )  image2: ( with 25 rows all controls [page1] [ page2 ] buttons go within the scoll area . ). This is the problem .. I want table headers and the controls to be visible at all times ..
[19:23:17] <robertmaxrees> vrishab you understand that thopse screenshots are entirely unhelpful, right?
[19:23:22] <robertmaxrees> like, a functioning example is what we need.
[19:23:29] <WhirledPress> sounds like a #css issue
[19:23:33] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:23:37] <robertmaxrees> it's a datatables issue.
[19:23:44] <robertmaxrees> there's likely a config option for it.
[19:23:59] <taplar> there's a fixed header config option for the top part
[19:24:04] <vrishab> robertmaxrees, ok . hold on a sec
[19:24:12] <taplar> for the bottom, not sure
[19:24:23] <robertmaxrees> vrishab taplar seems to have a direction to point you in ;)
[19:25:40] <taplar> strange that it would put the page options in the scroll area.  that hasn't been my experience with the plugin, but then again we don't do paging much
[19:25:42] <WhirledPress> robertmaxrees, thanks for pointing me in the direction of masked input. I was wondering if you had heard of the same thing where you could pass something like a regexp for a mask?
[19:26:04] <robertmaxrees> WhirledPress that doesn't make any sense.
[19:26:10] <robertmaxrees> are you looking for input validation?>
[19:26:23] <WhirledPress> sort of yes. More like input restriction
[19:26:31] <robertmaxrees> same difference.
[19:26:33] <robertmaxrees> that's not masking.
[19:26:51] <vrishab> taplar, I'm new to Datatables .. basically image 4 is the result I want ( which I got with "sScrollY": "400", ) ... but with that option the headers totally disappear .
[19:27:58] <WhirledPress> robertmaxrees, the funny thing is that I think what I want is input validation and masked input. I want a little helper text field that shows all possible valid character inputs to run under the input field.
[19:28:23] <robertmaxrees> WhirledPress then you need to list those out.
[19:28:26] <robertmaxrees> that's not input masking.
[19:29:50] <taplar> vrishab, take a look at http://datatables.net/extensions/fixedheader/
[19:33:41] <vrishab> taplar, thanks for the link .. I am using fixedHeader. I seem to get some config wrong here ..
[19:34:59] <taplar> ah, well they're boards might be able to help you out with that then
[19:35:10] <vrishab> Basically, without "sScrollY", the table is inside the scroll area ... with it fixedHeader has an issue ( not compatible as mentioned in the link )
[19:35:40] <taplar> yeah i saw that.  so without the sScrollY with fixedHeader what doesn't look right?
[19:35:58] <xebra> hi, what happens if you attach a jquery plugin to something more than once? For example, every time you resize the window, $('.class').dosomething({param: whatever}) is executed. It seems to work ok, but I'm not sure what happens. Flooding memory? How do I learn this?
[19:36:19] <vrishab> taplar, that is image 2
[19:37:03] <robertmaxrees> xebra depends on the plugin.
[19:37:37] <vrishab> and since the entire table is inside scroll area .. fixedHeader doesn't work here ...
[19:37:50] <taplar> what about the first example on this page? http://datatables.net/examples/basic_init/scroll_y.html
[19:38:57] <vrishab> taplar, perfect ... that seems to help .. will take a look ...
[19:39:03] <taplar> yay
[19:39:13] <vrishab> thanks much !!
[19:39:22] * taplar is strong in the googlefu
[20:29:20] <pickandmix> Hi guys, does anyone know how to do a scrolling png sequence effect?
[20:29:22] <pickandmix> Meaning when as I scroll down a div, a image will keep changing from img001 to img002, 003, 004 to so on.
[20:40:40] <WhirledPress> pickandmix, what do you mean? put the images one after the other  and they will appear one after the other as you scroll down
[20:45:45] <pickandmix> WhirledPress: yes
[20:45:54] <pickandmix> WhirledPress: I'm trying to achieve that haha.
[20:56:09] <WhirledPress> pickandmix, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/mn6gt4zx/ ?
[21:22:46] <pickandmix> WhirledPress: Hey
[21:23:11] <pickandmix> WhirledPress: I saw your fiddle, it's cool but how do I make it so that when I scroll down, the picture changes to img2 instead?
[21:23:32] <pickandmix> WhirledPress: Instead of a whole chain of image, I just want to see 1 image.
[21:23:50] <WhirledPress> at what point do you want the image to change?
[21:24:51] <pickandmix> say eg
[21:24:59] <pickandmix> the scrollbar is 400px
[21:25:10] <pickandmix> every 5px, the img will change, img001, img002, img003
[21:26:42] <WhirledPress> if the window is 400px, how long is the scrollable content?
[21:27:10] <pickandmix> What do you mean?
[21:27:45] <WhirledPress> the scrollbar scrolls content. for example, I have those 7 images and they are bigger than the holder, so the scrollbar appears.
[21:28:20] <WhirledPress> if the content you are scrolling isn't bigger than it's container, there's no scrollbar.
[21:30:39] <pickandmix> Someone told me I could put an invisibile element
[21:30:42] <pickandmix> invisible*
[21:31:07] <pickandmix> An example would be something like this, but I'm not sure how do I replicate it
[21:31:15] <pickandmix> http://jsfiddle.net/WTkqn/
[22:03:51] <compact> http://pastebin.com/yS2AmpvD <-- any idea why it adds it after each other. not a maths equation
[22:10:50] <wa_r_ch_i__ld1> anyone know how to login to an NTLM site via ajax?
[22:11:13] <wa_r_ch_i__ld1> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18527749/javascript-ajax-ntlm-authentication
[22:11:26] <Anniepoo> if I'm looking for an element with both a class and an attribute, how do I concat?  "#svgcontainer svg .el-rubber-band-layer[action="eo:addoval"] path" isn't working
[22:19:45] <Anniepoo> nvm, idiot error
[23:00:44] <DjinnASD> i have this output from a phpfile [["https:\/\/imagelink.jpg"],["https:\/\/imagelink2.jpg"]] can i iterate over that? i couldnt work out how to produce the json nodes associated with these nodes
[23:32:19] <WhirledPress> anybody know how to calculate the size of the scrollbar controls (like the up and down arrow buttons as well as the thumb)?
