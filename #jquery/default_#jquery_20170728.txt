[04:21:22] <jds> hello, how can I detect if a table changed contents?
[04:25:52] <FilipNortic_> jds: there is dom modification listeners but most often that is not a good way to go
[04:26:15] <jds> any alternative then?
[04:26:22] <jds> I found DOMSubtreeModified
[04:26:29] <FilipNortic_> are you sure you need to check for changes of a table and not on inputs or textareas
[04:26:54] <jds> its  a paginated table
[04:27:52] <FilipNortic_> so the change is in a third-party lib?
[04:27:59] <jds> y
[04:28:57] <FilipNortic_> well then you're really limited
[04:30:07] <jds> what are my options?
[04:31:29] <FilipNortic_> well without knowing how the table is set up, all i can think of is the dom modfications stuff
[04:32:22] <FilipNortic_> but when you have 2 trigger on something which is internal to a plugin it makes your design suboptimal
[04:33:22] <FilipNortic_> part of the point of using a plugin not having to care how it solves things and just using it's api
[05:08:14] <AnGe7> Hey all
[05:09:08] <AnGe7> i'm using datatable librairy and i would know how to associate attribute to each <tr> when my datatable is loaded (ajax) i would bind event..

[07:18:01] <sinthix> Hello all
[07:18:27] <sinthix> where can i do questions about jquery autocomplete?
[07:21:04] <Woet> sinthix: #jquery would seem like a good place for a jquery question.
[07:22:21] <sinthix> So, the problem i have is related to autocomplete with scroll in IE
[07:24:00] <sinthix> i've been searching for a fix for 2 days already, when i scroll in IE the box gains focus on the first element and doesn't let the scroll work properly
[07:26:49] <sinthix> is this a known issue? is there already a fix that i miss-googled?
[07:32:50] <Woet> which IE version?
[07:34:03] <sinthix> IE 11
[07:35:04] <Woet> does it happen on https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#maxheight ?
[07:35:18] <sinthix> but it also fails from ie 9 to 11
[07:35:24] <sinthix> let me check
[07:35:30] <sinthix> yes
[07:35:53] <sinthix> my first thought was going to try it in there
[07:40:44] <dglambert> yo
[07:42:23] <dglambert> hey so I am debugging this website, that I didn't have part of helping create
[07:42:45] <dglambert> And I am trying to find a good way to break on code, that I am not sure exactly how it was implemented
[07:43:03] <dglambert> Which makes it hard to know where to place the breakpoint
[07:43:27] <dglambert> But what it is doing is taking the fragment (#foo), and converting the url to /foo
[07:43:50] <dglambert> but it is not actually redirecting as far as I can tell because when I watch the network tab, I only see one text\document loaded
[07:45:04] <dglambert> Any suggestions on debugging something more generic like this
[07:45:43] <dglambert> I know there are techniques in Chrome for attaching a 'breakpoint' on the DOM and breaking when it is modified
[09:07:07] <MacroMan> Where in the jQuery source can I find the code that normalizes properties on mouse events?
[09:09:16] <MacroMan> I'm looking in https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js but I can't find anything specific to normalizing pageX and pageY which the documentation claims to normalize.
[09:35:39] <jak2000> which component: http://imgur.com/a/RHrqL    is this? exist other more beautiful? thanks
[09:52:29] <ExeciN> on a click of a button I'm displaying a modal and creating an iframe in it. I tried executing some javascript once the iframe loads but I couldn't get it working. this is what I'm using $("iframe.cboxIframe").on("load", function () { alert("iframe loaded"); });
[09:52:47] <ExeciN> how can I make it work after the iframe is loaded?
[11:53:21] <someone_> Hi, how to toggle a class when hold on it on phones, without getting copy/paste popup-box ?
[12:38:29] <poboy6> This does what I want, except when hovering over "File" I get a regular pointer instead of the hand.  Any thoughts on how to do that? https://zerobin.net/?fce19a09572a5961#kk8ngxFVRYAFRrU8fOcG/HKMpvz4s8L3gTYkv3sa0A8=
[12:44:58] <taplar> pointer vs hand is a css question
[12:47:52] <poboy6> taplar:  really?  I figured it'd be something to do with .hover()
[12:48:17] <taplar> no, what your pointer displays as is dependent upon the css properties for those elements
[12:48:56] <taplar> some elements have defaults that change the pointer
[12:49:06] <taplar> for others that you want to customize, you have to set it yourself
[13:47:08] <plamb__> is there someway to make the console on google chrome not remove the contents of console on page reload
[13:47:20] <plamb__> "preserve log" ?
[13:47:23] <taplar> there's a preserve log option
[13:47:28] <plamb__> cool
[13:58:20] <plamb__> i cant figure out why the code after the .submit() here is not executing:
[13:58:22] <plamb__> https://jsfiddle.net/kn810f63/2/
[14:00:36] <taplar> what do you mean?
[14:00:46] <plamb__> the console.logs dont show inside the submit
[14:00:56] <taplar> right?
[14:01:00] <plamb__> why is that
[14:01:04] <taplar> your creating an event binding
[14:01:16] <taplar> you have to submit to form after that runs to make it happen
[14:01:36] <taplar> which you don't want to do it this way anyway
[14:01:42] <taplar> there is the potential to bind multiple times
[14:01:48] <taplar> your binding inside another event handler
[14:01:50] <plamb__> tell me more :x
[14:01:57] <jak2000> which component: http://imgur.com/a/RHrqL    is this? exist other more beautiful? thanks
[14:02:10] <plamb__> well
[14:02:29] <plamb__> essentially i want the form to submit when the button is clicked, but only if the page contains #downloadEmail
[14:02:53] <taplar> then bind on the form, and inside the submit logic, check if that element exists.  If it does, cancel the event
[14:03:00] <taplar> err
[14:03:04] <taplar> only do it if it does exist
[14:03:07] <taplar> whatever your logic is
[14:03:22] <taplar> just don't multiple bind on things
[14:03:33] <taplar> r/multiple/duplicate
[14:03:38] <plamb__> hmmmm
[14:04:00] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you can probably inspect it and look for classnames and stuff to give you clues.
[14:04:05] <plamb__> is it like im chaining the 'click' and submit() together?
[14:04:18] <taplar> you are creating a new submit binding for each click
[14:04:23] <taplar> if the element exists
[14:04:34] <taplar> so if you clicked the button 50 times, 50 duplicate bindings
[14:04:41] <taplar> and then when you submit, 50 submits
[14:05:09] <plamb__> i love you forever if you modify my code
[14:05:12] <plamb__> i'll*
[14:05:18] <taplar> gonna hate me then
[14:05:21] <plamb__> :(
[14:05:34] <taplar> i've pretty much told you want you need to modify
[14:10:29] <plamb__> would it start like this
[14:10:30] <plamb__> $('.fileFormat').on('click','submit', function(e){
[14:10:41] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:10:44] <taplar> lol
[14:10:48] <plamb__> nevermind thats not the form element
[14:11:11] <taplar> and you did double events in the on
[14:16:36] <plamb__> i see examples in the docs being built like this
[14:16:37] <plamb__> https://api.jquery.com/submit/
[14:17:31] <robertmaxrees> built like what?
[14:17:42] <plamb__> a submit handler inside of a click handler
[14:18:01] <robertmaxrees> where do you see that"?
[14:18:16] <plamb__> the 2nd example on the page
[14:18:23] <taplar> submit() doesn't create a binding
[14:18:28] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/22imYyt.png
[14:18:30] <taplar> it invokes the submit
[14:18:44] <robertmaxrees> if you read the docs, you'll see that taplar is right.
[14:18:44] <taplar> if you give it a method as a param, it creates a binding
[14:19:22] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/n3npJcG.png
[14:19:33] <Uhkis> what's with the imgur today
[14:19:44] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis what do you mean?
[14:20:19] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: a lot of imgur "code" today
[14:20:24] <Uhkis> must be the friday
[14:20:27] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:20:35] <robertmaxrees> i'm posting those to show people that their answers are in the docs.
[14:20:42] <robertmaxrees> if they'd just, y'know, read them :)
[14:20:56] <plamb__> so whats the difference here
[14:20:57] <plamb__> http://i.imgur.com/undefined.png
[14:21:04] <plamb__> really..
[14:21:12] <robertmaxrees> plamb__ wat?
[14:21:15] <plamb__> http://imgur.com/a/IdlFN
[14:21:22] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* lol
[14:21:33] <Uhkis> now post to jquery doc issues to add id's so one can just paste that link
[14:21:44] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis you can do some of that.
[14:21:49] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis but people still don't read it.
[14:21:56] <robertmaxrees> which is why i outline the relevant bits in red.
[14:22:01] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise i get ignored.
[14:22:18] <robertmaxrees> plamb__ what's your question?  difference compared to what?
[14:22:27] <Uhkis> like that's not gonna happen with image links :D
[14:22:47] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) at least i'm being clear and explicit.
[14:22:50] <plamb__> it seems like this is the way to handle it if you want to do something when a form is submitted
[14:22:52] <robertmaxrees> there's no excuse either way.
[14:23:01] <robertmaxrees> plamb__ sure.  you bind to the submit event.
[14:23:28] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: i'm not saying your images are bad, just that people are... less than willing to read the docs
[14:23:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:23:41] <robertmaxrees> i've been doing this a loooooong time duder.
[14:24:02] <robertmaxrees> i'm removing that conversation of "have you read the docs?  check the docs.  the docs contain this information.  if you'd read the docs..."
[14:24:03] <robertmaxrees> etc etc etc
[14:24:50] <Uhkis> i wonder how many people here asking about anything has actually read the first words
[14:25:07] <Uhkis> something along the lines of "you need basic javascript knowledge to continue"
[14:25:08] <robertmaxrees> they generally skip to the examples.
[14:25:16] <plamb__> yep
[14:25:24] <robertmaxrees> which is bad.
[14:26:25] <robertmaxrees> i see it all the time with people asking about why event handlers for new elements don't work.  link them to the secton of the docs for .on about it and they skip to the first example, which is basically "this is the direct binding example"
[14:27:27] <plamb__> i realize im missing something completely fundamental about javascript here but uh
[14:27:40] <robertmaxrees> plamb__ fiddle?
[14:27:54] <plamb__> why does this *work* while the previous example with the logic inside .submit did not
[14:27:58] <plamb__> https://jsfiddle.net/kn810f63/5/
[14:28:12] <robertmaxrees> what's the second?
[14:28:17] <robertmaxrees> fiddle again pls
[14:28:22] <plamb__> https://jsfiddle.net/kn810f63/6/
[14:28:45] <robertmaxrees> so in that second one, you're binding a submit handler inside of a click handler.
[14:28:48] <robertmaxrees> which is a bad idea.
[14:29:03] <taplar> wut?
[14:29:10] <plamb__> is it possible to "submit a form on a click event and do some stuff on form submission" ?
[14:29:31] <robertmaxrees> well.
[14:29:38] <plamb__> for reasons you dont want to hear about, i cant use an <input type=submit/>
[14:29:55] <taplar> you don't have to
[14:29:59] <robertmaxrees> right
[14:30:03] <robertmaxrees> you bind two handlers.
[14:30:28] <robertmaxrees> the first one handles the submit of the form, the second one handles clicks on those links, which calls the submit on the form.
[14:30:56] <robertmaxrees> though now I gotta ask - why not just call the code you care about directly on click of those links?
[14:31:34] <plamb__> hmm
[14:31:39] <plamb__> are you saying i dont even need the submit
[14:31:44] <plamb__> just send the email over ajax
[14:31:55] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:32:02] <reynierpm> is there any way to catch the request URL from $(document).ajaxStart event?
[14:32:13] <robertmaxrees> unless your backend is setup for it, i wouldn't ditch the submit handler then plamb__
[14:32:24] <reynierpm> I am running a code there but I need to stop it's execution under a given URL
[14:32:24] <plamb__> yeah i think i need to send the POST
[14:32:25] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12235084/how-can-i-get-the-requested-url-from-ajaxstart-function
[14:32:44] <robertmaxrees> plamb__ then yeah, 2 handlers.
[14:32:50] <robertmaxrees> one for submit, the other for clicks that calls submit.
[14:33:01] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, hmmm :(
[14:33:10] <taplar> plamb__: what post?
[14:33:11] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm what?
[14:33:30] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm that SO post answers the question >.>
[14:33:48] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, I am talking about this "No, within ajaxStart you do not have access to the jqXHR object nor the ajaxOptions"
[14:33:53] <reynierpm> it's not possible
[14:34:07] <robertmaxrees> ah, right.
[14:34:11] <robertmaxrees> then you can't grab it heh
[14:34:19] <robertmaxrees> edit the ajax call itself to do the checkf.
[14:34:39] <reynierpm> yup maybe ajaxSend where I can grab the request
[14:34:53] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:35:01] <robertmaxrees> why not just do it in the actual function?>
[14:35:05] <robertmaxrees> instead of a global handler?
[14:35:36] <reynierpm> because I need to repeat the same code all over the ajax calls I have on such file and I am trying to avoid it
[14:35:38] <reynierpm> :D
[14:35:44] <robertmaxrees> erm
[14:35:54] <robertmaxrees> make abstracted function -> call function in ajax calls.
[14:36:11] <taplar> isn't that a smell?
[14:36:24] <taplar> the individual methods should have different urls, i'd assume
[14:36:30] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[14:36:41] <robertmaxrees> the issue you want to avoid is that global ajax handlers are confusing when something breaks for a particular set of ajax calls and suddenly something breaks but nobody can figure out why.,
[14:39:32] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, is fine to use the beforeSend and always $.ajax callbacks?
[14:39:46] <reynierpm> for achieve what I want?
[14:40:44] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm sure.  that makes it clear what's going on.
[14:40:48] <robertmaxrees> only add it to the calls that need it.
[14:41:09] <reynierpm> okey, I need to look now which one need it :run:
[14:41:10] <plamb__> im pretty sure this didnt actually change anything but eh
[14:41:12] <plamb__> http://jsfiddle.net/xQmYH/177/
[14:41:30] <robertmaxrees> plamb__ uhm
[14:41:31] <robertmaxrees> well.
[14:41:36] <robertmaxrees> trhat's not what ytou want.
[14:41:57] <robertmaxrees> plamb__ do you understand how functions in javascript work?
[14:42:44] <robertmaxrees> second, you're still trying to bind a handler within another handler
[14:42:48] <plamb__> probably not
[14:43:04] <robertmaxrees> plamb__ so how do you call a function?
[14:43:48] <plamb__> its a tool i rarely use
[14:43:52] <robertmaxrees> functions?
[14:43:59] <plamb__> no, JS/jquery
[14:44:08] <robertmaxrees> it's apart of the basics of javascript.
[14:44:15] <robertmaxrees> you don't know how to call a functionm?
[14:44:18] <robertmaxrees> *function
[14:44:55] <robertmaxrees> i'd highly suggest running through a basic free course on javascript.
[14:45:15] <plamb__> i wish i had time for that right now
[14:45:33] <robertmaxrees> it'll save you time if you do it.
[14:45:33] <taplar> you really need it
[14:45:36] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[14:45:48] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're relying on having other people do your stuff for you./
[14:45:49] <taplar> cause we are not here to solve your issues.  we're here to teach you
[14:45:53] <User1_> Hi there just loaded jquery ui spinners -  but really want to change up the triangles - is there an easy option that allows me to do this?
[14:45:53] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[14:46:19] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm if you're struggling so much, how can you trust any code you're given?
[14:46:42] <plamb__> unfortunately i cant take a JS course over the weekend and turn in this project on monday
[14:46:43] <robertmaxrees> i could easily craft something that scrapes the contents of one of your pages and send that data to my server and cause you all kinds of headaches.
[14:46:46] <plamb__> ill try stackoverflow
[14:46:52] <robertmaxrees> woops wrong person* plamb__
[14:46:53] <robertmaxrees> duder
[14:47:05] <taplar> wait, is this homework?
[14:47:10] <plamb__> no
[14:47:13] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, I am not struggling at all, it was working before but now we've added a new functionality which is an AJAX call and we don't need to run that piece there
[14:47:16] <taplar> o.O
[14:47:21] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm i was talking to the wrong person hahaha
[14:47:21] <robertmaxrees> sorry
[14:47:24] <plamb__> its for an a/b test im running on my employers website
[14:47:26] <robertmaxrees> meant that for plamb__
[14:47:28] <reynierpm> yeah I think so
[14:47:40] <robertmaxrees> plamb__ so if you're responsible for these things, you need to learn to write code.
[14:47:42] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, could be the case when the .always doesn't wait on the call isn't finished yet? I mean when you haven't receive a 200 response from the server?
[14:47:46] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you cannot do your job.
[14:48:05] <reynierpm> *doesn't wait on the call to be finished?
[14:48:15] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm always is called after the deferred resolves or rejects.
[14:48:19] <robertmaxrees> so it has to wait until it's done.
[14:48:19] <plamb__> coding is a minority part of my job and JS is a very small minority of that
[14:48:29] <robertmaxrees> plamb__ but obviously you need it soooo
[14:49:00] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, hmmmm weird I have been running in some cases when the spinner disappear before the AJAX call finish
[14:49:20] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm i'd have to see the code.
[14:49:34] <robertmaxrees> it could be churn in the rendering or something else.
[14:49:59] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, give me a sec I'll share it on fiddle
[14:51:24] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/17escn6h/ nothing weird there as for me
[14:52:02] <robertmaxrees> what does load_end do?
[14:52:35] <Uhkis> reynierpm: how about moving #19 to #2
[14:52:45] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, look again https://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/17escn6h/1/
[14:53:04] <reynierpm> Uhkis, how is that?
[14:53:41] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm how are you confirming the ajax call has finished?
[14:53:56] <reynierpm> because the spinner disappear
[14:54:12] <robertmaxrees> you make it go away in .always() >.>
[14:54:26] <reynierpm> ohh sorry because I am looking at the network tab on the chrome dev tools and I can see the call still running
[14:54:39] <Uhkis> reynierpm: i mean show that loading thing on click, not on beforesend, then dismiss it in done()
[14:54:54] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm always is called after the ajax call returns (shrug)
[14:55:06] <reynierpm> Uhkis, I can do that as well
[14:55:31] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, so what you say is that shouldn't be happening
[14:55:33] <reynierpm> right?
[14:55:49] <reynierpm> meaning the load end be called before the ajax call finish
[14:56:02] <robertmaxrees> well
[14:56:07] <robertmaxrees> where do you fire the loading icon?
[14:56:08] <Kartagis> ahoy. I'm making an app and in that, I'm auth'ing. the problem is that, even if the auth is a success, I am still seen anon. can you help me with that?
[14:56:39] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis doesn't sound like a jquery problem to me ;)
[14:56:44] <reynierpm> en the beforeSend
[14:57:07] <Kartagis> reynierpm: ajax
[14:57:09] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis probably have better luck with a channel related to whatever auth lib you're using.
[14:57:11] <Uhkis> Kartagis: perhaps
[14:57:14] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: ^
[14:57:30] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis show code then
[14:57:41] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm erm - setTimeout(showLoadingImg, 1);
[14:57:47] <robertmaxrees> why are you waiting to show the image?
[14:58:30] <reynierpm> hmmm didn't notice that
[14:58:35] <reynierpm> :-|
[14:58:40] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:58:53] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: https://da.gd/M6Of
[14:59:32] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis so where's the bug?
[14:59:36] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: whoami says I'm anon
[15:00:07] <robertmaxrees> from the success function?
[15:00:24] <robertmaxrees> where do you even call that?
[15:00:26] <Kartagis> no, I check separately
[15:00:57] <taplar> ???
[15:01:03] <robertmaxrees> uh
[15:01:07] <robertmaxrees> this makes no senmse.
[15:01:09] <robertmaxrees> *sense
[15:01:22] <robertmaxrees> you're not persisting that data anywhere that it would get magically sent to/from the server.
[15:01:42] <robertmaxrees>  unless your server is storing that the user is authenticated per whatever session cookie you're using.
[15:01:50] <Kartagis> what data?
[15:01:51] <robertmaxrees> but you kind of want to avoid  setting those via ajax.
[15:02:09] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis how is the server supposed to know you're authenticated?
[15:02:43] <Kartagis> I'm using drupal with the services module, which gives me the API
[15:03:05] <robertmaxrees> right so nothing in your code does anything other than hit some endpoints and set some headers.
[15:04:27] <robertmaxrees> the user should have some kind of session id or something in an httponly cookie and then your backend tracks if that user is authenticated or not.
[15:07:24] <taplar> hold on one sec.
[15:07:36] <taplar> the session id wouldn't necessarily be a csrf token though
[15:07:45] <taplar> no?
[15:07:59] <Kartagis> hmm, could that be because I'm using domain.tld and not www.domain.tld?
[15:08:02] <Kartagis> because the very same approach works flawlessly in another app4
[15:11:26] <Flerex> guys, is it efficient the way i'm creating the event linstener inside a loop? https://pastebin.com/yMjzF2P5
[15:11:37] <Flerex> it feels like it is not to me
[15:13:46] <taplar> Flerex: look into using a delegate instead
[15:14:31] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[15:15:38] <Flerex> thanks!!
[15:15:39] <Flerex> :)
[15:20:09] * Kartagis is stumped
[15:26:28] <plamb__> join me kartagis
[15:29:32] <Kartagis> join you? why?
[15:55:19] <plamb__> god it to work but just skipping .submit all together
[15:55:21] <plamb__> got*
[15:59:56] <robertmaxrees> what happens if the user hits enter in an input?
[16:00:20] <plamb__> a nasty 404
[16:01:01] <plamb__> wonder if i can just remove the form and leave the input
[16:01:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:02:01] <robertmaxrees> so then you didn't need the form post at all?
[16:02:23] <plamb__> i just fire the ajax request when the click is made
[16:02:27] <robertmaxrees> ....
[16:02:43] <robertmaxrees> that would've been salient information when I asked about that exact thing a while ago heh
[16:02:51] <plamb__> :(
[16:03:17] <plamb__> looking back i guess i didnt NEED to submit a form, it just seemed like what i should be doing
[16:04:06] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[16:17:40] <Kartagis> erm. did anyone reply to me while I was disconnected?
[16:17:55] <Kartagis> I was lagging very bad
[16:18:22] <taplar> i get that way in front of hotties
[16:20:59] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis there are public logs at irc.jquery.org fwiw :)
[16:24:58] <Kartagis> taplar: session id is not the token, I use that to auth
[16:31:11] <taplar> you use what to auth?
[16:32:06] <Kartagis> token
[16:41:13] <taplar> the csrf tokeN/
[16:41:16] <taplar> blah
[16:43:34] <taplar> afaik, usually the session id would still be used for auth.  the csrf token is just a one time thing, or short duration thing, as a secondary validation
[16:44:41] <Kartagis> taplar: I'm using almost the same thing for another app, and that works flawlessly. why do you think?
[16:45:21] <taplar> no clue, i'm just talking about the csrf concept at this point
[16:47:04] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis is the other app setup the same way server-side?
[16:47:13] <Kartagis> aye
[16:47:40] <taplar> what requests does it make for the bad request, and what response codes do they get?
[16:50:34] <Kartagis> taplar: one sec, let me show
[16:51:46] <taplar> i'm getting a 404 on the second call
[16:51:58] <taplar> "Could not find the controller"
[16:53:29] <taplar> nvm, was hitting the wrong endpoint
[16:53:36] <taplar> so that works fine for me through a rest client
[16:54:44] <Kartagis> you want the token or login?
[16:55:08] <taplar> i did both token and connect through a rest client and they worked fine
[16:55:53] <Kartagis> hit token.json again to query whether you're auth'd
[16:57:25] <taplar> token gave me a new one
[16:57:39] <taplar> and connect returned the same response again
[16:57:53] <taplar> obviously i am an 'anonymous user', :D
[16:58:27] <Kartagis> sorry, connect.json
[16:58:52] <Kartagis> see? you auth'd but you're still anon
[16:59:03] <taplar> i'm not authed though
[16:59:27] <taplar> that's not what csrf tokens are meant to be used for
[16:59:33] <Kartagis> I used login.json too
[17:00:04] <taplar> have you ever used a rest client?
[17:02:24] <Kartagis> if you look at my pastebin, I store the name in localStorage on success, which should mean I'm auth'd
[17:02:30] <Kartagis> it gets set
[17:02:33] <taplar> have you ever used a rest client?
[17:02:38] <Kartagis> no
[17:03:04] <taplar> then that's possibly a good next step for you, and it would be a good debugging learning experience.
[17:03:09] <taplar> it's going slightly OT though
[17:03:21] <taplar> https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rested/   <-- this is an example of one that is fairly decent with firefox
[17:03:42] <taplar> you can use rest clients to check your endpoints outside of javascript to make sure they work as expected before you start putting them in your javascript
[17:03:53] <taplar> or if you want to debug them to make sure it is an issue with your javascript
[17:08:37] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis you're aware that setting something in localstorage is just setting a value, right?
[17:08:45] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean anything else will happen with it.
[17:09:06] <Kartagis> aye, but I set that on success
[17:09:31] <robertmaxrees> erm.  are you sure you're actually authenticating?
[17:09:46] <robertmaxrees> success just means it was a good response from the server.  doesn't mean that response did what you want it do
[17:09:47] <robertmaxrees> *to
[17:09:53] <taplar> ^^^
[17:10:33] <Kartagis> successful response from login.json doesn't mean that I'm auth'd?
[17:11:04] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating what jquery means by "success" vs. what the server is responding with.
[17:11:24] <robertmaxrees> "success" can mean "we got a well-formed body with a particular set of status codes"
[17:11:28] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't check anything else.
[17:12:16] <robertmaxrees> err, *does mean
[17:12:19] <Kartagis> I just checked, login.json's response says I'm auth'd
[17:12:31] <robertmaxrees> link to your code again?
[17:13:13] <Kartagis> https://da.gd/pdSJ
[17:13:19] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: ^
[17:13:29] <taplar> btw, when is 'whoami' called?
[17:14:33] <Kartagis> I call that manually  to check
[17:14:38] <robertmaxrees> have you looked at each of these request bodies to see if they're responding with what you want?
[17:15:13] <Kartagis> aye, and they do
[17:15:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:15:44] <robertmaxrees> you keep saying that last call says you're not.
[17:15:48] <robertmaxrees> *not authenticated./
[17:16:27] <Kartagis> it says that
[17:16:30] <Kartagis> one sec
[17:16:48] <robertmaxrees> also: you're doing a bunch of posts but no data is attached to any of them.
[17:16:53] <robertmaxrees> so I'm way lost about what's supposed to happen here.
[17:17:09] <taplar> heh
[17:17:33] <robertmaxrees> so many nested ajax calls.
[17:18:44] <Kartagis> http://paste.debian.net/978695/
[17:18:56] <Kartagis> this is my whoami call
[17:19:14] <robertmaxrees> so let's back up.
[17:19:20] <robertmaxrees> how is the server supposed to identify the user?
[17:20:44] <Kartagis> with the token
[17:20:51] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:20:58] <robertmaxrees> XSRF tokens != session tokens.
[17:21:02] <robertmaxrees> totally unrelated concepts.
[17:21:05] <taplar> ++++++++++
[17:21:14] <Kartagis> I send the token and get the response that I'm auth'd
[17:21:20] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:21:24] <Kartagis> but whoami says I'm not
[17:21:29] <robertmaxrees> you realize that all your cookies are apart of that payload, right?
[17:21:48] <robertmaxrees> "<Kartagis> I send the token and get the
[17:21:48] <robertmaxrees> response that I'm auth'd
[17:21:53] <robertmaxrees> what if you don't send the toekn?
[17:22:29] <taplar> the 'response that i'm authed' is also linked to login.json i would think, where as your issue you are finding is with 'connect.json'
[17:22:44] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[17:24:10] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: current setup requires that I send the token
[17:24:23] <taplar> we're debugging man
[17:24:33] <robertmaxrees> okay.  but you realize that CSRF tokens and sessions are unrelated, right?
[17:25:47] <Kartagis> yes
[17:26:09] <robertmaxrees> so how is the server identifying x user is authenticated?
[17:26:19] <robertmaxrees> what metric is it using?
[17:26:27] <robertmaxrees> *data, not metric
[17:28:40] <Kartagis> it sets a session
[17:28:46] <Kartagis> not me
[17:28:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:29:09] <robertmaxrees> you keep saying "a session" but it sounds like you're not sure how it does that.
[17:29:25] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing there's some funk with your httpOnly cookies.
[17:30:27] <Kartagis> http://imgur.com/a/qYHtk <--- this is when I used whoami() in the success function
[17:30:36] <taplar> have you tried doing your connect call in the whoami with the original token?
[17:30:42] <robertmaxrees> i'm not talking about the response body fwiw.
[17:30:49] <robertmaxrees> but httponly cookies
[17:31:58] <robertmaxrees> like, gotta look at all parts of those requests.
[17:35:38] * Kartagis headdesks
[17:35:55] <Kartagis> it just dawned on me
[17:36:11] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:36:39] <Kartagis> when we query token.json we get a new token and I use that to query whether I'm auth'd
[17:36:50] <Kartagis> no wonder I'm anon
[17:36:50] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:36:58] <robertmaxrees> because tokens have nothing to do with auth.
[17:36:59] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:37:36] <taplar> it just dawned on you, like how i asked about it?
[17:37:39] <taplar> lol
[17:37:51] <taplar> fridays
[17:39:20] <Helixdnb> hey friends, quick question - I'm setting up a series of dynamic selects based off of parameters from prior selects - something like country, platform, color, retailer, buy button
[17:39:39] <Kartagis> and I'm still anon
[17:39:57] <Helixdnb> country, platform, color all having subsequent sets of key value pairs
[17:40:30] <taplar> Helixdnb: what kind of selects are you talking about?  $() or <select> ?
[17:40:45] <Helixdnb> <select>
[17:40:53] <taplar> alright, continue, :D
[17:41:27] <Helixdnb> ie, I pick US, then platform pulls from us_platforms = {}
[17:41:38] <Helixdnb> etc
[17:41:40] <Helixdnb> I would like to have one single "retailers" array, with the key being setup like
[17:42:17] <Helixdnb> 'country_name.platform.color.retailer': 'www.address.com'
[17:42:42] <taplar> i would argue against that
[17:42:47] <Helixdnb> oh?
[17:43:09] <taplar> i would go for a structure that accesses like
[17:43:43] <taplar> countries[aCountry].platforms[aPlatform].colors[aColor].retailers
[17:44:13] <taplar> each country would have it's related platforms
[17:44:18] <taplar> each platform it's related colors
[17:44:23] <taplar> each color it's related retailers
[17:44:58] <taplar> if i choose USA
[17:45:02] <taplar> and need to load platforms
[17:45:13] <taplar> countries['USA'].platforms has all my data
[17:45:29] <taplar> and a following pattern for color
[17:46:26] <taplar> if you have it all as one key, then to store all your data you are going to have to have either multiple maps, or you would have to do some matching, usually partial matching, against keys
[17:46:29] <taplar> which is just messy
[17:46:58] <taplar> if that makes sense
[17:47:10] <Helixdnb> kiiiiiiiiiiiinda...reading through it now
[17:52:45] <Helixdnb> see basically what I'm trying to do is avoid/simplify this:
[17:52:45] <Helixdnb> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2063d035778c8c693bc67b25ccc62b94
[17:53:35] <Helixdnb> and replicate something like this: https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/buy-now/deluxe
[17:54:30] <robertmaxrees> that second url is just a page.
[17:54:45] <Helixdnb> click buy now
[17:54:47] <Helixdnb> sorry
[17:55:04] <Helixdnb> https://cdn1.unrealengine.com/Fortnite/3556412/5.homeview.epic-fortnite.js - line 2100ish
[17:55:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:55:48] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/ap27u2wu/  this is what i'm suggesting.  or something like it
[17:56:26] <Helixdnb> yea
[17:56:40] <Helixdnb> that's very similar to what I was trying to replicate
[17:57:08] <taplar> you just maintain the parent child relationship and have the keys be the options for the selects
[17:57:24] <taplar> or optionally the key could be the value of the option with an inner label or something being the display text
[17:57:25] <taplar> whatever
[17:58:28] <Helixdnb> ok - that's starting to make sense
[17:58:50] <Helixdnb> been about 4-5ish years since I last dealt with json
[18:01:22] <Helixdnb> ok, so then in that example that you put, to get the countries, I would loop through countries[], correct?
[18:01:41] <Helixdnb> well the keys of that anyway
[18:01:57] <taplar> there's also an Object.values() i believe if you do not care about the keys
[18:02:18] <taplar> ya
[18:02:34] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[18:02:55] <taplar> but if you are using the data to build your selects, you care about the keys
[18:02:57] <robertmaxrees> i'd almost invert this an make a big array of retailers and give them the relevant attributes.
[18:03:12] <Helixdnb> well that's what I had originally mentioned
[18:03:47] <taplar> robertmaxrees: ya, might be a smaller structure, though there would be some duplication of values
[18:05:55] <Helixdnb> because the thing is, I need to be able to take an "edition" of a product, determine if it's one of two versions of that product, based on that selection I would get a list of applicable countries. based on that further selection I would get a list of platforms, based on that further selection I would get a list of retailers
[18:06:57] <Helixdnb> and clicking that link would go to that exact "configuration"
[18:07:27] <taplar> so you don't want to show all countries, but a subset?
[18:07:42] <Helixdnb> correct, some countries may not carry that product
[18:07:48] <Helixdnb> in that configuration
[18:07:57] <taplar> the configuration being?
[18:08:11] <taplar> the entire select chain?
[18:08:26] <Helixdnb> edition > version > country > platform
[18:08:31] <Helixdnb> yes
[18:08:40] <taplar> ok, so just country and platform
[18:08:50] <Helixdnb> well, and version
[18:08:51] <taplar> hrrm
[18:08:53] <Helixdnb> and edition
[18:08:58] <taplar> right, but those are not selects
[18:09:06] <taplar> so that would be metadata in the json that you'd filter on
[18:09:19] <Helixdnb> version would be
[18:09:23] <Helixdnb> well, a radio
[18:09:39] <Helixdnb> but yea, taplar
[18:09:47] <taplar> yeah, it might be better to flip this then some how
[18:10:03] <Helixdnb> https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/buy-now/deluxe - click buy now button
[18:10:07] <taplar> you'll get some duplicate values, but finding stuff will be easier most likely
[18:10:11] <Helixdnb> that's the easiest way to say "this is what I mean"
[18:11:16] <Helixdnb> https://cdn1.unrealengine.com/Fortnite/3556412/5.homeview.epic-fortnite.js - line 2014 is where that starts
[18:11:25] <Helixdnb> well 2100
[18:11:45] <Helixdnb> but see how you have d = {         defaultValue: "us",         title: "epic.fortnite.founder.dialog.step1.retail",         territories: {             us: {
[18:15:02] <taplar> so really the lowest level element is a product right?
[18:15:22] <Helixdnb>  ps4RetailAmerica: {                         title: "epic.fortnite.founder.dialog.platform.ps4",                         value: "ps4RetailAmerica",                         defaultValue: "amazonPs4",                         retailers: {                             amazonPs4: {                                 title: "epic.fortnite.founder.dialog.retailer.amazon",                                 value: "amazonPs4",                        
[18:15:26] <Helixdnb> er
[18:15:30] <taplar> countries have retailers, who sell products, which have editions and versions
[18:15:48] <taplar> ?
[18:16:02] <Helixdnb> http://jsbin.com/butezanugo/edit?js
[18:16:11] <taplar> heh, we've gone OT into data modeling territory
[18:16:42] <Helixdnb> well, this is even the quick version that I'm using as a temporary solution until I fully implement a sql-based solution
[18:17:43] <taplar> you're going to spend a lot of time creating a json structure to then make a sql db instead?
[18:19:36] <Helixdnb> the sql db is going to be much later and much more involved
[18:19:54] <taplar> if that's the case, then yeah whatever json you can quickly come up with that works.  cause if it's just temporary, so long as it doesn't hurt performance, no reason to spend a lot of time on it if you're just going to replace it.
[18:20:12] <Helixdnb> right
[18:20:54] <taplar> so let me ask you this
[18:21:04] <taplar> when you get to your sql solution, how is that going to work?
[18:21:05] <Helixdnb> sure
[18:21:16] <Helixdnb> in what regards
[18:21:33] <taplar> are you expecting the sql to build whatever data the page needs, or are you going to make frequent requests to get just the data you need at that point in time?
[18:21:56] <taplar> like, it will get you the data for the first 3-4 things
[18:22:10] <taplar> and then choosing following selects will cause rest calls to get the latter select options
[18:22:28] <Helixdnb> well it'll be a single select at a time
[18:22:47] <taplar> but you said to start with it beings based on like 3-4 things
[18:22:52] <Helixdnb> pick the version of the edition and you get the countries
[18:22:54] <taplar> that's what i was referring to int he first part
[18:23:27] <taplar> but anyway
[18:23:42] <taplar> so you are planning on select changes will hit a rest endpoint to retrieve further data for select options?
[18:23:43] <Helixdnb> ie foreach edition {    // SELECT * FROM edition_countries LEFT JOIN countries ON edition_countries.country_id = countries.id WHERE edition_id = edition.id    dropdown with countries
[18:24:28] <Helixdnb> yes
[18:24:41] <taplar> alright, :D, so here would be my suggestion of something to consider
[18:24:53] <taplar> go ahead and make your rest endpoints
[18:25:14] <taplar> make your frontend call the endpoints like you expect they will need to work with your sql database
[18:25:29] <taplar> for now, your backend can work with json or whatever
[18:25:44] <taplar> and then when you transition over from json to sql, your front end will not have to change
[18:26:08] <Helixdnb> makes sense :)
[18:26:36] <Helixdnb> cool, thanks for the help in pointing me in the right direction :)
[18:26:47] <taplar> np.  hopefully that will save you some work later on
[18:26:49] <Helixdnb> have to head out now though, have a good weekend everyone
[18:26:52] <Helixdnb> yeap
[18:26:54] <taplar> u2
[20:07:58] <neo_> how called sites where users public their ads ?
[20:08:06] <neo_> ads board ?
[20:11:36] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:11:49] <robertmaxrees> have an example?
[20:25:45] <neo_> robertmaxrees, like this https://www.avito.ru/
[20:26:08] <robertmaxrees> ah.  like classifieds?
[20:26:15] <neo_> robertmaxrees, from russian its translate directly board of ads
[20:26:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:26:51] <robertmaxrees> you asked what it's called (shrug)
[20:27:12] <neo_> robertmaxrees, or like this , how in English called this type of sites ?
[20:27:28] <robertmaxrees> I just told you >.>
[20:27:42] <neo_> we called it board of ads ? in English board of classifieds ?
[20:28:03] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[20:28:11] <robertmaxrees> just a classifieds site
[20:28:18] <neo_> ok, clearly
[20:28:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
