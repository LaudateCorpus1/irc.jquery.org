[00:04:28] <hucv9> hey there. i'm currently writting an ajax lib. it's open source on github. i want to integrate testcases with travis but i'm totally new on the area (python, c++ guy) is there a good step by step guide or example how to write many different web calls, check responses, html replacements? appreciate some advises! thanks :)
[00:04:41] <hucv9> writing.. far too late ;)
[00:07:37] <hucv9> it's... i don't know really how to start ;) there is qunit. phantomjs.. some other libs i never used befor. know nothing about structure and handling...thats what i'm looking for
[00:08:02] <Krinkle> hucv9: nodejs, grunt, qunit, profit!
[00:08:08] <Krinkle> travis, github, even more
[00:08:15] <Krinkle> https://github.com/Krinkle/travis-ci-node-and-browser-qunit
[00:08:55] <Krinkle> long story short: use grunt-contrib-qunit, and write a package.json for dependencies, and .travis.yml to instruct Travis how to run the tests.
[00:09:05] <Krinkle> see also http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/languages/javascript-with-nodejs/
[00:09:21] <hucv9> Krinkle: thanks! you know a usefull quickstart guide or something like that?
[00:09:40] <Krinkle> hucv9: A boilerplate for how to write it is https://github.com/Krinkle/travis-ci-node-and-browser-qunit
[00:09:43] <nesoi> I want to update a list every time I get new data for it from the server, but I may or may not be on the page that has the list. What's the best way to do that?
[00:09:53] <hucv9> Krinkle: thanks! i will check this out :)
[00:09:54] <Krinkle> for how to use QUnit itself http://qunitjs.com/
[00:10:00] <nesoi> can I update it even if the page is not loaded? (JQM btw)
[00:10:32] * Krinkle is stepping out
[00:11:24] <hucv9> Krinkle: https://github.com/Krinkle/travis-ci-node-and-browser-qunit   <-- that's what i'm looking for. thank you forr putting that on github
[00:38:17] <nesoi> if I clear a div and then append stuff to it, do I have to refresh it so it displays properly?
[00:38:59] <nesoi> I know I need to refresh listviews, but how about other divs?
[00:47:05] <sammich> markup will be displayed as it's defined with CSS. Widgets, on the other hand, generally build markup around your element(s)
[01:04:43] <nesoi> so what's the correct way to put data into a div, take it out, and put more data into it?
[01:05:08] <nesoi> I'm doing $('#divname').append(data);
[01:05:14] <nesoi> then .empty
[01:05:17] <nesoi> then .append again
[01:05:28] <nesoi> but the second time it doesn't display anything
[01:10:49] <nesoi> what am I doing wrong??
[01:12:56] <nesoi> no one's here?
[01:14:47] <jfrc> nesoi: try html() instead of append when there is no data
[01:15:23] <nesoi> jfrc:  thing is, it works fine when there is no data
[01:15:33] <nesoi> it doesn't work when there was data and I'm trying to replace it
[01:16:38] <nesoi> jfrc:  that didn't workâ€¦ it still displays it only the first time
[01:17:57] <nesoi> what could be happening? I tried .append, .html and .text
[01:18:09] <nesoi> the first time it works, the second time nothing appears
[01:20:00] <nesoi> jfrc:  any ideas?
[01:20:39] <jfrc> nesoi: try replace or replaceWith()
[01:21:15] <jfrc> wait
[01:22:35] <nesoi> if I used replacewith I'd have to put in the <civ></div> no?
[01:22:47] <nesoi> I didn't find .replace
[01:22:51] <jfrc> u can save data in variable and then use .html() to chnage the div  text
[01:23:03] <nesoi> jfrc:  how do you mean?
[01:23:12] <nesoi> what would I save?
[01:24:00] <jfrc> nesoi: use a variable to hold data if u need it, then use .html()
[01:24:21] <nesoi> jfrc:  I have the data. the problem is that it's not displaying.
[01:24:30] <nesoi> I did a console.log and the data is there
[01:25:07] <jfrc> then it should show. try another browser
[01:25:20] <nesoi> I can't. this is an android phonegap app
[01:26:35] <nesoi> why would it show the first time but not thereafter?
[01:27:31] <jfrc> sorry i do not know about android and jquery
[01:27:40] <nesoi> it's just a browser
[01:28:09] <nesoi> do you not have to do some kind of refresh like listview('refresh')?
[01:28:31] <jfrc> no need to refresh. nes data shows instantly
[01:29:38] <jfrc> *new
[01:29:46] <jfrc> nes=new
[02:24:30] <Dotte> Please, I need to check if an input exists and show it's value (validate it) : http://pastebin.com/5z8GEZ04

[02:34:26] <titii> Hi guys, i am finding, trying, but without any good result. How can I add some text in a days field of the ui datepicker
[02:34:28] <titii> ?
[02:35:09] <titii> I need to put here some little info about day, is it possible?
[02:37:35] <titii> heeeelp
[02:51:57] <titii> But I think, maybe I can do it with the beforeShowDay property, but I playing with that

[03:19:59] <Mehrdad_> hello, anyone here familiar with nivo slider?
[03:20:21] <Mehrdad_> i have difficulty using it in a sort of different use case
[03:20:55] <Mehrdad_> the problem is, it makes image taller, very tall, and it completely messes the css up
[03:21:39] <Mehrdad_> for instance, i have an img which is about 300px tall and nivo makes it like 700px when displayed :/
[03:23:07] <Mehrdad_> it just increases h arbitrary
[03:24:23] <okdamn> hi guys sorry, how do i replace all words starting with "#" in a string?
[03:29:45] <Mehrdad_> just assume there's no jquery involved, why an img be stretched to the full height & width of its container?
[03:43:58] <prit> want to develop menu just like this site http://www.sony.co.in/section/home

[04:04:49] <sonOfRa> Matt`, try jquery UI droppable
[04:47:26] <Mehrdad> hello, any one know how can i prevent nivo slider from adding inline style to images?

[04:58:24] <b0x> unless you can print 3d mechanical robot dogs
[04:58:50] <Mehrdad> lol , ok now, i'm a fool for believing those things
[04:59:33] <b0x> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jvLalY6ubc
[04:59:34] <b0x> see
[04:59:39] <Mehrdad> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing

[04:59:58] <Mehrdad> ok now, i'm mad
[05:00:10] <b0x> the bricks might be 3d printed

[05:03:20] <b0x> yep
[05:03:50] <b0x> life was heaps easier when you could just club your neighbour over the head, and go back to your fire
[05:04:08] <b0x> those were the days
[05:04:28] <Mehrdad> :D
[05:05:35] <Mehrdad> that fuckin video you posted
[05:05:40] <Mehrdad> watching it now
[05:06:00] <b0x> careful
[05:06:11] <Mehrdad> that's like from Deux Ex series
[05:06:40] <b0x> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntlI-pDUxPE
[05:06:52] <Mehrdad> i'm still not convinced about 3d printing
[05:07:12] <Mehrdad> i mean you can tell me that humans are sent to mars now in good condition
[05:07:13] <b0x> someone 3d printed a boat
[05:07:17] <Mehrdad> but this one, is just nuts
[05:07:21] <b0x> and they didnt drown terrible deaths
[05:07:25] <b0x> so
[05:07:34] <b0x> theres some truth to such voodoo
[05:08:34] <Mehrdad> you know they pics or it didn't happen, i call bullcraps on that, i'd say touch it or it didn't happen
[05:09:38] <Mehrdad> you're just posting videos on robots
[05:09:46] <Mehrdad> i'm talking about printers
[05:20:50] <Mehrdad> well good thing they're just mocks, for now
[05:21:31] <Mehrdad> models aren't a huge deal but still
[05:22:11] <CrysAk> any ideas why this is'nt working? http://pastie.org/private/pubsn24mdqrxxugxrxo7kq
[05:22:29] <CrysAk> i want a "contact us" link to be replaced with an email address link, however it's just removing it :/
[05:22:35] <CrysAk> (to avoid scraping)
[05:30:10] <CrysAk> sorted, missed closing bracket on mailto
[05:35:17] <Mehrdad> anyone can help me sort this? http://support.dev7studios.com/discussions/nivo-slider-jquery-plugin/BP-253368
[05:37:52] <CrysAk> Mehrdad,  there is a youtube eideo that does a brilliant job of getting nivoslider working as intended, i think there's a few issues with it out fo the box and the fdefault documentation on it doesnt fix it
[05:37:55] <CrysAk> i'l try find it
[05:38:22] <CrysAk> Mehrdad,  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jIbmu_JNNo&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL
[05:38:45] <CrysAk> Mehrdad,  it will probably require you to delete EVERYTHING you have so far and start from scratch, but beilive me it;s worth it, my nivoslider now works 100% as intended
[05:39:34] <CrysAk> i had all kinds of weird shit going on with nivoslider, streching, displaying images below/to the left, not scaling properly etc, this fixed everything
[05:40:19] <Mehrdad> oh thank you, watching it now , and yeah, it's been quite a hassle trying to sort it out
[05:40:27] <Matt`> what would cause a string to cause this? "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'replace'"
[05:40:37] <Mehrdad> i found that it adds inline styles to the images, what a messy job
[05:41:04] <CrysAk> yea, it's nice once it works though ^^
[05:42:25] <Mehrdad> what's that accent/ :/
[05:42:38] <Mehrdad> ?
[05:43:47] <CrysAk> midland england
[05:44:11] <CrysAk> hmm.. maybe south
[05:44:22] <CrysAk> sounds liek somehwere west of london
[05:45:12] <Mehrdad> it's ok, i can understand it generally
[05:46:37] <venom00ut> hi, will jquery ever adopt DOM4 promises?
[05:49:49] <Mehrdad> CrysAk do i have to  watch all of it and rewrite it just  to get the stretching sorted?
[05:51:47] <CrysAk> doe everything then you have a clean base
[05:51:49] * CrysAk away
[05:53:03] <Mehrdad> lol @ youtube  captions : "at the lake until suddenly romantic room "

[06:07:05] <shahin8r> A real newbie question. The 'pager' variable is used out of scope, how to prevent this? See: http://pastebin.com/tZsJzECK
[06:12:09] <shahin8r> Nvm, just set the var before the if statement and set the variable with pager = false; instead of declaring variable inside if statement.
[06:24:54] <Mehrdad> i couldn't get it to work :(
[06:25:04] <Mehrdad> i mean, it didn't tell anything about my problem
[06:25:21] <Mehrdad> anyone else please? http://support.dev7studios.com/discussions/nivo-slider-jquery-plugin/BP-253368
[06:26:10] <Mehrdad> i'm looking at the source code and i can see where it is doing that , but i'm not sure how to fix it
[06:26:20] <Mehrdad> i could break it and make matters worse
[06:27:56] <Mehrdad> i'm on the verge of writing my own image box
[06:28:05] <Mehrdad> that doesn't include slide or effects
[06:28:17] <Mehrdad> but i'd appreciate getting nivo fixed
[06:38:37] <CrysAk> Mehrdad,  jsute start fresh and setup up as tutorial says, then it will work, my issue wasnt"listed as a fix" in there iether, but it sets it up 100%
[06:38:49] <CrysAk> or you cna spend hours trying to find out whats wroung with your code :/
[06:39:42] <Mehrdad> for now, i changed course
[06:39:49] <Mehrdad> i'll look into it further later
[06:41:32] <dylan9o4> hey anybody on?
[06:41:51] <dylan9o4> i really hope so
[06:43:06] <dylan9o4> does anyone have the time to take a glance at my code and see where I can improve it? its pretty broken-down
[06:43:11] <dylan9o4> I would appreciate it
[06:44:10] <modestkdr> dylan9o4: code?
[06:44:48] <dylan9o4> modestkdr: yes you can see the functionality in the output by hovering, clicking, etc
[06:44:49] <dylan9o4> http://jsbin.com/ubinax/3/edit
[06:45:53] <dylan9o4> modestkdr: the main thing is to simplify, and the one problem I ran into is hovering, then leaving the element quickly, then I am forced to restart the output, I would love to fix that
[06:47:00] <modestkdr> dylan9o4: you could a 2 milli second delay for instance, for the hover (before displaying the slide in content)
[06:47:21] <modestkdr> you could use* a
[06:48:08] <dylan9o4> modestkdr: thanks, how would that help?
[06:48:35] <modestkdr> dylan9o4: you said you wanted to fix " hovering, then leaving the element quickly"
[06:49:00] <dylan9o4> modestkdr: could you show me the best way to implement the delay?
[06:51:07] <modestkdr> dylan9o4: example http://www.hawknetdesigns.com/adding-delay-to-css-hover-jquery/
[07:47:29] <adavia> hi.. im trying to leave only the first element (img) and hide the rest of them http://jsfiddle.net/qgdGg/1/
[07:52:39] <Matt`> Can anyone explain why this happens? http://pastebin.com/xK0sq2UD
[07:55:51] <dabear> adavia: http://jsfiddle.net/qgdGg/2/
[07:56:41] <dabear> Matt`: you are selecting a dom element, not a dom element wrapped in a jquery object
[07:56:51] <dabear> jquery objects have a .data method, dom elements do not
[07:57:10] <Matt`> oh, putting it inside $() will fix it?
[07:57:20] <adavia> dabear:  thanks i didnt realize about not(:first)
[07:57:38] <dabear> Matt`: are you using .get() or something?
[07:57:47] <dabear> use .eq() or .slice() instead
[07:58:04] <Matt`> dabear: no, I'm grabbing the selected text from CKEditor
[07:58:24] <dabear> wrapping it would work
[07:58:58] <tanghus> he, I got an error registering at http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ The recommendation on the error page was to create create a ticket. Catch 22
[07:59:25] <dabear> jquery doesn't have bugs
[07:59:25] <Krambiorix> hi, i use jquery file upload plugin (https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload) to upload files... Why on intialisation it sends a request?
[07:59:35] <dabear> it's the bugs that have jquery!
[07:59:45] <dabear> :p
[07:59:51] <tanghus> lol
[08:00:21] <dabear> Krambiorix: no idea. because it wants to do that?
[08:08:05] <Krambiorix> dabear, and i want a pony :D
[08:10:41] <Propheteus> guys, i have a quick question, i wanna make a login webpage with a div that contain the picture of the guy typing, lets say Jane want to connect to the website, when it type Jane and tab out of the user form, it display her picutre
[08:10:44] <Propheteus> is it doable ?
[08:14:53] <dabear> Propheteus: doable, but legal?
[08:15:05] <Propheteus> dabear: why ?
[08:15:09] <dabear> you would expose pictures of all your users to the public
[08:15:15] <dabear> potentially
[08:15:43] <Propheteus> in fact, it's an intranet website, it's not supposed to be available to the rest of the world lol :)
[08:15:49] <Propheteus> it's for my coworkers
[08:17:08] <Propheteus> but i have no clue on how to fetch the photos
[08:17:09] <dabear> do you want a picture of all your users to be available to all those who can connect to the intranet?
[08:17:29] <dabear> and no, that's not only your decision
[08:17:40] <dabear> also your legal department's choice
[08:17:42] <Krambiorix> if they are all beauties, go for it
[08:17:43] <Propheteus> sound legit
[08:18:03] <Propheteus> no they arent ;p
[08:18:06] <Propheteus> jk
[08:18:13] <Gorkyman> hey guys... anyone else having issues with handling "change" event on "select" element on firefox mobile on tablet?
[08:19:03] <dabear> Propheteus: are all your users inside a windows domain? you can use ntlm so users don't have to log in
[08:19:30] <Krambiorix> Propheteus, better show a popup on login to welcome them (with their picture)
[08:19:45] <Propheteus> dabear: yes windows
[08:20:09] <Propheteus> Krambiorix: i do that already when they log in i grab the picture from the db
[08:20:32] <Propheteus> but i want'd to know the technic on grabing a picture on change
[08:20:35] <Propheteus> on tabs
[08:21:17] <dabear> Propheteus: .blur(function(){ get picture through ajax})
[08:21:32] <Krambiorix> or on change
[08:21:39] <tanghus> Ended up being easier to send a pull request than to file a bug :p
[08:22:04] <Propheteus> dabear: gonna test That ;)
[08:22:16] <dabear> don't think pull requests against jquery are handled without a bug ticket, though
[08:22:19] <dabear> could be wrong
[08:23:11] <dabear> Propheteus: if you have pictures stored on the file system, you could just prepend an <img src="path/to/pic/username.png">
[08:23:51] <Propheteus> dabear: you mean in the user's machine ??
[08:24:04] <dabear> lol, no
[08:24:09] <dabear> don't ever do that
[08:26:22] <tanghus> dabear: another catch 22 then ;)
[08:26:24] <Propheteus> yeah, i was like "huh?" lol , i'll never store the pic that way :)
[08:26:51] <dabear> Propheteus: I never ever suggested doing that either
[08:30:40] <adavia> dabear:  in this case how can i make it work showing only the first element on each row http://jsfiddle.net/qgdGg/3/
[08:32:29] <Gorkyman> works good on chrome mobile but not on ff
[08:32:44] <Gorkyman> $(document).on("change", ".test", function(e) {
[08:33:22] <dabear> adavia: not sure if there's a selector for it, possibly :nth-child though
[08:35:24] <adavia> umm
[08:43:27] <dabear> adavia: maybe this will do: http://jsfiddle.net/qgdGg/5/
[08:44:52] <adavia> dabear:  ohh thats works great... thanks =)
[08:56:25] <MalfaitRobin> This regex works in php, but how can I get it working with jQuery? $pattern = /\[\[(.+)\]\]/g;
[09:09:31] <eddyb> hehe, I just realized I can do this (in ES6) to remove the ugly [0]: let [canvas] = $(`<canvas>`)
[09:15:06] <doug65536> MalfaitRobin: what do you mean by "with jquery"
[09:15:34] <doug65536> MalfaitRobin: you mean javascript?
[09:15:46] <MalfaitRobin> doug65536 well I want to use jquery or javascript whatever to replace a certain pattern with data from a json array
[09:16:19] <doug65536> MalfaitRobin: javascript has regex built in
[09:17:58] <doug65536> MalfaitRobin: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions
[09:20:22] <doug65536> >> "hello".replace(/llo/, "hi") @ MalfaitRobin
[09:20:54] <MalfaitRobin> doug65536 already found it but thanks :)

[09:44:31] <malorie_> how can I register a click event listener for a class that's not present on document ready?
[09:44:38] <sammich> Fraz: the left hand side has to be a literal
[09:45:11] <sammich> {[number|string]:value}
[09:45:29] <sammich> malorie_: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:45:39] <MalfaitRobin> http://regexr.com?35qnq
[09:45:46] <MalfaitRobin> can somebody help? http://regexr.com?35qnq
[09:45:59] <malorie_> sammich: yeah, that's what I'm using already, but it seems I'm doing it wrong
[09:46:58] <sammich> $('a-parent-selector').on('click', 'a-child-that-parent-selector', function() { /* code */ });
[09:47:10] <sammich> if you just want to be lazy
[09:47:27] <sammich> $('body').on('click', '.class', handler);
[09:47:34] <sammich> handler = function() {}
[09:48:18] <malorie_> sammich: http://ideone.com/Cw3Sfe that's what I have so far
[09:48:39] <malorie_> the problem is, that the menu gets immediately retracted after it's been expanded
[09:52:51] <howieFelterbush> Hey all, how do I get the viewport dimensions? using $(window).width() is not reporting correctly. Any suggestions?
[09:54:54] <malorie_> sammich: can you spot a problem with the code I posted?
[09:55:00] <sammich> one sec
[09:55:15] <malorie_> :-)
[09:56:13] <sammich> http://jsfiddle.net/gTaBV/1/
[09:57:20] <sammich> clearer http://jsfiddle.net/gTaBV/2/
[09:59:23] <malorie_> sammich: thanks! do you know what was the problem with my code?
[10:01:29] <sammich> the top binding tells jquery to set an event occur on click for those selected elements
[10:02:04] <sammich> the bottom one will listen for events at elements at $nav that have come from that selector
[10:02:28] <sammich> for that reason, the bottom on is used for dynamic events
[10:02:33] <sammich> dynamic elements
[10:03:12] <sammich> the top one binds the click() to everything that matches your selector when it's run
[10:03:55] <sammich> in almost all situations, I like to use .on() to bind handlers
[10:04:21] <sammich> only for elements I know that are permanent fixtures, I'll use the simple .event()-type
[10:06:09] <Doggie52> Hmm
[10:07:19] <Doggie52> Bootstrap's typeahead updater function is being run with the wrong parameter. I type 'AB' and select 'ABCD' in the list -- the updater is then run with just 'AB' and not 'ABCD'...
[10:07:25] <malorie_> sammich: ok, that makes sense. thanks again
[10:08:45] <howieFelterbush> When applying a background-image to an element, how can you preload the background so it fades in?
[10:09:13] <sammich> you preload the image
[10:09:22] <sammich> then you fade it in
[10:09:27] <Doggie52> Never mind, it didn't do that.
[10:09:30] <sammich> well, then you apply it, then fade it in
[10:10:18] <sammich> you set the element containing the image to !visible
[10:10:41] <sammich> opacity:0 or hide(0)
[10:11:02] <sammich> add your css for background image. then show(400)
[10:11:32] * sammich out
[10:14:21] <howieFelterbush> sammich thanks for the reply. How do you set the browser prefixed properties for an element. Like moz-background-cover   ? Do you camelcase it like you do other css props?
[10:15:14] <howieFelterbush> sorry, just missed him. Anybody know the nomenclature for setting browser prefixes in css properties from jquery?
[10:15:42] <dbcclarke> Hey can someone help me map mySQL data to a jq plot on my ruby on rails app?
[10:15:50] <dbcclarke> jquery jqPLOT
[10:20:57] <doug65536> howieFelterbush: item.css({"background-color": "red"})
[10:21:17] <doug65536> notice quotes around background-color, same thing for -moz-whatever
[10:22:14] <doug65536> howieFelterbush: was that what you were asking?
[10:22:43] <howieFelterbush> doug65536: so you can quote the properties of an object? wild. Normally, i just use   item.css({backgroundColor:"red"});    thanks. I'll try it.
[10:23:51] <howieFelterbush> bgStyle.background = "url (" + $('#bg_img_blur').data('url') + ") no repeat center center fixed"
[10:27:38] <howieFelterbush> doug65536: thanks a ton. it works perfectly!
[10:27:43] <doug65536> howieFelterbush: np
[10:29:21] <steve-perkins> Is "jquery-ui-touch-punch" still the best way to make jQuery UI drag and drop work on touchscreens, or has something new superseded it?  I see that it hasn't been updated in two years...
[10:30:32] <howieFelterbush> I am using css3  and background-size:cover to make one image (focus) cover the viewport bg. But I want a masked area on top of it to reveal another image in the same position (blurred)...how can I do that?
[10:31:17] <howieFelterbush> right now I have them stacked with the blurry version hidden. But I just want to show a part of the blurry one.
[10:32:35] <doug65536> howieFelterbush: you can use a div with overflow:hidden put the image in there, and specify top and left on the image to control what part of it is shown
[10:33:01] <doug65536> negative top and left
[10:33:29] <howieFelterbush> doug65536: , but since I am using "cover" to do the math for my BG image, how can I determine the offset?
[10:35:15] <doug65536> howieFelterbush: good question. I suppose doing the "cover" calculation manually is one way to know
[10:35:32] <doug65536> howieFelterbush: not sure, I'm not a css wizard yet :)
[10:36:09] <tw2113> did you get your letter to CSS Hogwarts yet?
[10:36:27] <tw2113> or are you going to Durmstrang? :D
[10:37:15] <howieFelterbush> oh yeah, I could brave #css...likely going to be hazed for it. Thanks for your help
[10:51:36] <dannydagger> hey guys.. how can I prevent jquery from running on handheld device? can this be done with modernizr?
[11:01:46] <doug65536> dannydagger: may I ask why?
[11:03:57] <ravenzz> dannydagger http://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-media-queries/
[11:05:14] <dannydagger> ravenzz: awesome thanks, gonna check it out
[11:06:09] <ravenzz> check this out too https://github.com/ten1seven/jRespond
[11:07:46] <dannydagger> can someone perhaps help me out with my jquery on this site? when you scroll down to the "portfolio" section, the images are overlapping with the masonry plugin.. when i debug the js it says I have a couple of errors.. but I don't really know how to fix them :( http://colorworld.se/ramzi/
[11:07:57] <dannydagger> ravenzz thanks gonna check that out too
[11:13:06] <ravenzz> dannydagger they don't seem to overlap here, anyway the error is pretty obvious
[11:13:11] <ravenzz> cannot call methods on masonry prior to initialization; attempted to call 'reload'
[11:13:42] <dannydagger> ravenzz: they overlap in every google chrome I've tried on the first load.. then when i refresh they are ok
[11:13:56] <dannydagger> ravenzz: yes, but I dont know how to rewrite that :/
[11:14:13] <dannydagger> not too skilled with jquery
[11:15:01] <ravenzz> np
[11:15:03] <dannydagger> you might have a clue?
[11:15:32] <ravenzz> dannydagger why are you using that imagesLoaded plugin?
[11:15:56] <dannydagger> because I read that imagesLoaded would help with the overlapping images but it doesnt
[11:16:23] <ravenzz> just "mansonryze" your stuff on window load (which assures you that the images were already loaded)
[11:16:57] <ravenzz> so instead of $(document).ready(function () { $('#itemwrapper').masonry({ /* settings */}); })
[11:17:15] <ravenzz> $(window).load(function () { $('#itemwrapper').masonry({ /* settings */}); })
[11:18:31] <dannydagger> gonna try, should I remove imagesloaded?
[11:18:49] <dannydagger> and that reload thing?
[11:19:06] <ravenzz> yes
[11:20:07] <dannydagger> awesome, appreciate it a lot bro!
[11:20:20] <ravenzz> does it works?
[11:20:23] <ravenzz> -s
[11:20:23] <dannydagger> seems so yes
[11:21:23] <ravenzz> cool
[11:21:55] <ravenzz> are you from Malmö?
[11:21:58] <dannydagger> now I'm just gonna remove masonry for mobile mediaqueries
[11:22:00] <dannydagger> yeah
[11:22:12] <dannydagger> and you? sweden?
[11:22:26] <ravenzz> no copenhagen
[11:22:31] <dannydagger> ah cool
[11:22:51] <ravenzz> well maybe you should develop mobile-first
[11:23:23] <dannydagger> yeah I was thinking so initially.. I regret now I didnt hehe
[11:25:25] <dannydagger> can I ask you another question? you see the top lines in my main.js? the sticky navbar part. When you minimize the window so the MQs kick in, a menu button comes up.. but when you click the menu button.. the menu hides even for the initial size without media queries.. do you know how I can fix this? so the menu is always visible without media queries even when the menubutton has been clicked
[11:25:25] <dannydagger> to hide the menu
[11:26:39] <dannydagger> I tried   $('.navbar').addClass('hidden'); and then setting visibility:visible in the css for the navbar, but that didn't show the menu
[11:29:52] <dannydagger> sorry I meant i tried $('#menu').addClass('hidden');  and visibility:visible for #menu in css
[11:29:55] <Mr_Grim> with $.ajax what is the best way to handle connection timeouts and retrys? let's say i want to attempt 3 retry's
[11:30:31] <Mr_Grim> do I have to write the retry logic myself or can $.ajax handle that for me?
[11:34:06] <ravenzz> dannydagger do you want the menu to be open? I don't understand what you mean sorry
[11:34:20] <ravenzz> dannydagger do you want the menu to be open? I don't understand what you mean sorry. Doesn't it work without media querires?
[11:35:12] <ravenzz> Mr_Grim http://stackoverflow.com/a/10024557/931594
[11:35:32] <dannydagger> I want the menu to be closed for mobile device, but open when I click on the menubutton.. but when i click the menubutton again to close it, and then increase the window.. then the menu is hidden even for initial view without media queries
[11:36:21] <dannydagger> you know what i mean?
[11:37:16] <ravenzz> ah
[11:37:20] <ravenzz> yes
[11:37:28] <Krambiorix> hi is there some kind of jquery plugin to make directory structures ?
[11:37:35] <Krambiorix> eg. Windows explorer
[11:37:51] <ravenzz> dannydagger well you should reset its status on resize
[11:37:55] <ravenzz> I guess
[11:38:02] <dabear> Krambiorix: that is not possible
[11:38:56] <dannydagger> ravenzz: how do I do that?
[11:40:04] <ravenzz> dannydagger you can either use the jRespond plugin, or add some logic on resize $(window).on('resize', function () { });
[11:41:09] <dannydagger> I will give jRespond a try.. will it take care for me automatically on load?
[11:41:25] <dannydagger> sry but I'm a real newbie when it comes to jquery hehe..
[11:41:43] <ravenzz> np, it is all about reading the doc
[11:41:50] <dannydagger> alrighty
[11:42:09] <ravenzz> https://github.com/ten1seven/jRespond/blob/master/README.md
[11:43:32] <dannydagger> thanks mate
[11:44:04] <ravenzz> you're welcome
[11:47:41] <Krambiorix> dabear, well , there is something like jquery filetree, i wondered if there were others
[11:54:14] <dannydagger> ravenzz: ok i've read the readme but I havent got much smarter unfortunately.. should i add var jRes = jRespond([ to the top of my main.js? and I dont know what to type in the addFunc.. and how do I disable some jquery plugins for media queries in addFunc?
[11:58:33] <doug65536> dannydagger: that plugin is overkill for simply getting resize events... it is for making major changes to layout to adapt to a wide range of window sizes
[11:58:35] <dannydagger> ravenzz: or I think I understand.. add class hidden on enter breakpoint.. and add class visible on exit breakpoint.. but when I exit the breakpoint it doesn't work
[11:59:13] <ravenzz> yeah or just remove the hidden class
[11:59:33] <dannydagger> doug65536: oh ok.. you know a simpler way to fix my problem?
[12:00:38] <dannydagger> ravenzz: great thanks.. removeclass worked.. what should i write to disable some jquery plugins when it enters breakpoint handheld?
[12:00:43] <doug65536> dannydagger: you simply want to hide the menu when the window resizes? now I'm having trouble following
[12:01:49] <dannydagger> doug65536: I want to hide the menu when you visit the site with a handheld.. but when you click the menu button, it should be visible.. and when you click it again it should hide, but when you click it again to hide it.. the menu gets hidden even for the original view (not media queries but the desktop/laptop view)
[12:02:27] <dannydagger> right now the menu is open initially when you visit it with a handheld.. and when you minimize the window on a laptop/desktop and toggle the menu.. it dissapears even when you resize the window back again
[12:02:30] <dannydagger> you follow?
[12:03:05] <doug65536> I think so. jquery has a .toggle() function to hide/unhide easily
[12:03:28] <doug65536> or .slideToggle to animate it
[12:04:04] <doug65536> in your page, put $(function { ... }) and the ... code will run on page ready (it waits for the page to be ready)
[12:04:08] <doug65536> oops
[12:04:12] <doug65536> in your page, put $(function() { ... }) and the ... code will run on page ready (it waits for the page to be ready)
[12:04:56] <dannydagger> ah
[12:04:58] <dannydagger> that doesnt work
[12:05:02] <doug65536> so if your "menu" is a div, and it has id="menu_div", then $("#menu_div").slideToggle() will hide it if it's visible, or unhide it if it's not
[12:05:20] <dannydagger> I had that function already.. but it doesnt unhide it
[12:05:36] <dannydagger> because i first have         $('#menu').addClass('hidden');
[12:05:45] <dannydagger> but i have visibility:visible in my css for #menu
[12:05:55] <doug65536> use native jquery for that. use $('#menu').hide()
[12:06:09] <doug65536> or .slideUp to animate it
[12:06:37] <dannydagger> why is that better? just curious
[12:06:56] <doug65536> .hide() is better because all the other stuff like slideToggle or .toggle() will work
[12:07:06] <dannydagger> alright great
[12:07:54] <doug65536> there is also fadeIn, fadeOut, etc...
[12:08:05] <dannydagger> i used hide.. but my #menu is still hidden even though I have visibility:visible for it
[12:08:07] <dannydagger> in the css
[12:09:46] <doug65536> hide() hides it. what is the problem?
[12:10:27] <dannydagger> I'll just upload it and let you check it out if you want to
[12:10:30] <doug65536> ok
[12:12:34] <dannydagger> http://colorworld.se/testing123/
[12:12:44] <dannydagger> minimize the window for the MQ to kick in
[12:13:02] <dannydagger> you see initially the #menu is hidden
[12:13:48] <doug65536> don't pass 'hide' to toggle
[12:14:42] <dannydagger> ah.. how should I hide the menu for handheld devices then?
[12:14:50] <dannydagger> when they click on the menubutton
[12:14:55] <doug65536> check window.width I guess
[12:15:31] <doug65536> like, if (window.width < 640) $('#menu').hide()
[12:15:43] <doug65536> or some other reasonable width
[12:15:52] <dannydagger> ok sounds nice.. gonna try
[12:16:09] <dannydagger> but how about toggling the menu if width < 640? I want users to be able to toggle it
[12:16:18] <dannydagger> or slide it down
[12:16:28] <doug65536> wait, $(window).width() is safest way
[12:16:51] <dannydagger>  $(window).width() { < 640) $('#menu').hide()  ?
[12:17:22] <doug65536> yes, if ($(window).width() < 640) $('#menu').hide();
[12:17:28] <doug65536> you're missing the semicolon there too
[12:17:32] <doug65536> that's why it isn't working
[12:18:23] <doug65536> it's weird though, you can get away with missing semicolons. stupidest thing ever put into javascript language
[12:18:39] <dannydagger> doug65536: the jQuery vesion (.hide) is causing some minor problems.. I'd rather go with the addClass
[12:19:12] <doug65536> your code is invalid though...
[12:19:39] <dannydagger> I'm a hardcore newbie when it comes to jquery thats probably why :/
[12:19:46] <doug65536> <doug65536> you're missing the semicolon there too
[12:19:58] <dannydagger> you mean after hide()?
[12:20:02] <doug65536> yes
[12:20:06] <dannydagger> i put it there
[12:20:09] <dannydagger> doesn't change anything
[12:20:20] <obert> clear browser cache :)
[12:20:21] <doug65536> did you remove 'hide' argument to toggle call?
[12:20:48] <dannydagger> no.. but how will I be able to toggle hide/view without it?
[12:20:52] <dannydagger> on a mobile device
[12:21:04] <doug65536> the parameter is invalid
[12:21:11] <doug65536> toggle() already hides/shows
[12:21:19] <doug65536> you don't specify 'hide' there
[12:21:34] <dannydagger> ah.. just $('#menu').toggle; ?
[12:21:47] <doug65536> $('#menu').toggle();
[12:22:31] <dannydagger> yeah not it works better, thanks.. gonna try that window width thing too
[12:23:05] <dannydagger> is there no way of letting the css override the jquery with the visibility? even though jquery gives #menu class hide?
[12:23:10] <dannydagger> without the window width?
[12:23:19] <ravenzz> yes
[12:23:28] <dannydagger> how?
[12:23:29] <doug65536> if you really want to use the class, there is a toggleClass function
[12:23:30] <ravenzz> !important rules can do that for you
[12:23:40] <dannydagger> ravenzz: i tried !important that didn't do it.. gonna try it again
[12:24:07] <dannydagger> ravenzz: nope it is still invisible
[12:24:32] <doug65536> $('#menu').toggleClass('hidden')   -- it removes that class if it is already there, and adds it if it is not there
[12:24:44] <dannydagger> doug65536: gonna try
[12:24:54] <ravenzz> dannydagger what is the url of your website again?
[12:25:02] <dannydagger> ravenzz: www.colorworld.se/testing123
[12:25:52] <dannydagger> doug65536: still hidden
[12:26:03] <ravenzz> dannydagger initially it is display: none;
[12:26:09] <ravenzz> why?
[12:26:14] <dannydagger> hmm
[12:26:34] <doug65536> dannydagger: are you updating the site?
[12:26:39] <doug65536> it's not changing for me
[12:26:54] <dannydagger> i dont have display:none in the stylesheet
[12:27:01] <ravenzz> you have $('#menu').hide()
[12:27:24] <ravenzz> in main.js
[12:27:32] <dannydagger> ravenzz: yes, but i have visibility:visible in the main.css for #menu
[12:27:33] <doug65536> togglewrapper doesn't exist
[12:27:44] <ravenzz> dannydagger that's not the same thing
[12:27:48] <dannydagger> doug65536: yes it does in the html, not any class to it in main.css
[12:27:48] <doug65536> the id is menutoggler
[12:28:14] <ravenzz> remove that $('#menu').hide()
[12:28:19] <dannydagger>             <figure id="togglewrapper"> is the container
[12:28:21] <dannydagger> ravenzz: ok
[12:28:27] <dannydagger> ravenzz: what should I add instead?
[12:29:09] <doug65536> if you don't update the site it's all guesswork
[12:29:22] <dannydagger> ok im gonna remove it and update
[12:29:51] <dannydagger> updated it now
[12:30:23] <doug65536> it works for me
[12:30:34] <doug65536> try slideToggle, it looks nicer
[12:30:49] <doug65536> instead of toggle
[12:30:52] <dannydagger> doug65536: yes, but minimize the window and toggle the menu, and then resize it back up
[12:31:05] <dannydagger> doug65536: the #menu will be invisible when you resize it back after toggling the menubutton
[12:32:06] <doug65536> you're missing semicolons on like 11 and 13
[12:32:30] <dannydagger> fixed that now, still not working
[12:32:46] <ravenzz> dannydagger something like this: http://pastie.org/8203568
[12:33:11] <dannydagger> ravenzz: is that gonna work without the jRespond?
[12:33:14] <doug65536> dannydagger: works for me
[12:33:28] <ravenzz> dannydagger oh are you using jRespond?
[12:33:33] <dannydagger> ravenzz: no
[12:33:35] <ravenzz> ah ok
[12:33:51] <ravenzz> yes that works
[12:34:09] <dannydagger> ravenzz: no $(function) on top before the vaR?
[12:34:10] <dannydagger> var*
[12:34:12] <doug65536> dannydagger: you might need to refresh
[12:34:28] <ravenzz> dannydagger what do you mean?
[12:34:29] <doug65536> dannydagger: ah, I see the bug...
[12:34:51] <ravenzz> dannydagger put it inside $(document).ready()
[12:35:04] <dannydagger> ravenzz: ok
[12:35:07] <dannydagger> doug65536: you see the bug?
[12:36:12] <doug65536> dannydagger: where is the code that shows/hides MENY button
[12:37:26] <dannydagger> doug65536: line 760.. it is hidden there.. but it is visible in the media queries on line 1399
[12:37:34] <dannydagger> in main.css
[12:37:35] <ravenzz> dannydagger is it working?
[12:37:54] <dannydagger> ravenzz: no it screws up my masonry plugin.. gonna try again
[12:38:07] <ravenzz> can I see it in action?
[12:38:10] <dannydagger> 1 sec
[12:38:27] <dannydagger> first $(document).ready(); ? or should it say something more there?
[12:38:38] <doug65536> dannydagger: line 760 of what? none of the files have 760 lines
[12:38:45] <dannydagger> doug65536: main.css
[12:39:19] <ravenzz> dannydagger you already have that $(function () {}) is an alias of $(document).ready(function () {});
[12:39:47] <dannydagger> ravenzz: ahh ok
[12:39:50] <ravenzz> so put the code snippet I gave to you inside $(function () {})
[12:39:55] <dannydagger> yessir 1 sec
[12:40:35] <ravenzz> in fact all your code should be inside that function
[12:40:41] <dannydagger> ravenzz: updated the site
[12:40:54] <ravenzz> I am talking about // Smooth Goto Anchor // Set Page Slides and Masonry
[12:41:11] <dannydagger> ok gonna change it
[12:42:32] <dannydagger> ravenzz: ok updated it now check the site.. I am not able to toggle the menu when minimized
[12:42:33] <ravenzz> where did the click thing to hide the menu go?
[12:42:46] <dannydagger> it went away with the code you gave me..
[12:42:47] <ravenzz> hehe accidentally you deleted the click handler
[12:42:49] <dannydagger> wait
[12:42:49] <dannydagger> haha
[12:42:54] <dannydagger> i thought i should
[12:43:02] <ravenzz> oh no :)
[12:43:07] <dannydagger> ok lol
[12:43:09] <dannydagger> fixing it
[12:43:18] <doug65536> dannydagger: there's the bug...
[12:43:37] <dannydagger> doug65536 ?
[12:43:53] <doug65536> dannydagger: why .is('hidden')
[12:44:02] <doug65536> .
[12:44:40] <ravenzz> doug65536 because he is toggling that class
[12:44:50] <dannydagger> ravenzz: updated it now.. check it out still not working
[12:45:03] <doug65536> ravenzz: no, he is doing removeClass
[12:45:32] <ravenzz> doug65536 wait, don't confuse things 1 sec
[12:45:38] <doug65536> replace .is with .hasClass('hidden')
[12:45:40] <ravenzz> dannydagger I wasn't talking about $('#menu').toggle();
[12:45:50] <ravenzz> doug65536 that's the same thing indeed
[12:46:20] <dannydagger> ravenzz: not? what did you mean then?
[12:46:23] <ravenzz> dannydagger I was talking about this http://pastie.org/8203603
[12:46:35] <dannydagger> ahh ok
[12:46:38] <dannydagger> placing it there again 1 sec
[12:46:42] <ravenzz> yep
[12:47:03] <doug65536> ravenzz: if by "same thing" you mean far more efficient, then sure
[12:47:37] <dannydagger> ravenzz: updated it.. but when you toggle the menu the #menu is still invisible when resized back to big size
[12:48:08] <ravenzz> doug65536 but yeah hasClass is more efficient I think
[12:48:51] * x86 #WGR114! APPEARS AS SALLY
[12:49:11] <x86> roflcopter
[12:49:23] <ravenzz> dannydagger ok let me fix my snippet to adapt to your code
[12:49:29] <dannydagger> ok
[12:49:56] <dannydagger> thanks for having patience with my jquery incompetence guys :D
[12:49:58] <doug65536> if you're going to use that class, change line 15 to $menu.toggleClass('hidden')
[12:50:01] <ravenzz> I thought  you were using the hidden class to hide/show the menu
[12:50:08] <doug65536> if you're going to use that class, change line 15 to $menu.toggleClass('hidden');
[12:50:34] <dannydagger> YESSSSSSSS
[12:50:35] <ravenzz> dannydagger http://pastie.org/8203612
[12:50:36] <dannydagger> worked now
[12:50:42] <ravenzz> yeah
[12:50:53] <dannydagger> ravenzz: i just did what doug said instead
[12:50:59] <dannydagger> thanks a lot both of you
[12:51:18] <dannydagger> updated the site too
[12:51:26] <dannydagger> is the rest of my jquery looking ok? or lots of errors everywhere?
[12:51:33] <dannydagger> or rest of my main.js
[12:51:35] <ravenzz> by the way you should store your selection in variables
[12:51:54] <ravenzz> so you don't query the DOM repeatedly
[12:52:16] <dannydagger> ravenzz: what does that mean?
[12:52:21] <ravenzz> you have an example of what I mean there $menu = $('#menu');
[12:52:25] <ravenzz> and then you use $menu
[12:53:05] <ravenzz> when you do $('#menu') jQuery queries the DOM in order to find your element
[12:53:19] <dannydagger> ah ok.. but with the var it queries the main.js?
[12:53:41] <ravenzz> no if you save that selection in a variable
[12:54:03] <ravenzz> next time you can use it without querying the dom again
[12:54:20] <doug65536> the function "captures" accessed variables outside its scope when it is created. it's called a closure
[12:54:37] <ravenzz> 2) put all the other stuff inside $(function () { });
[12:55:01] <dannydagger> ravenzz: all the other stuff is under fuction
[12:55:47] <dannydagger> I still have a problem with the menu though.. when i visit the site via my iphone.. the menu is open initially.. I want it to be closed initially, and then opened when the users press the menu button
[12:55:57] <doug65536> ravenzz: it's working because his script tags are at the bottom of the html
[12:56:09] <ravenzz> yeah
[12:56:33] <doug65536> dannydagger: you need to do the 'if' thing with window width
[12:56:34] <ravenzz> doug65536 i didn't see the change
[12:56:56] <dannydagger> and also.. i want the menu to hide when a user presses a link button in the menu.. the menu is still up even though a link has been pressed on iphone
[12:57:02] <dannydagger> how can I do that?
[12:58:11] <doug65536> dannydagger: add a click handler to #menu that does if ($(window).width() < breakpoint) $menu.addClass('hidden');
[12:58:28] <ravenzz> dannydagger you know what, I am going to make a working fiddle for you
[12:58:47] <dannydagger> ravenzz: I'm gonna buy you a few beers in copenhagen! :)
[12:58:51] <doug65536> dannydagger: like this: $("#menu").on('click', function() { if ($(window).width() < breakpoint) $menu.addClass('hidden'); });
[12:58:54] <dannydagger> doug65536: gonna try
[12:59:22] <grafi> what oÃ´
[13:01:10] <dannydagger> doug65536: i dont think that code matches the rest of my code.. it doesnt work
[13:01:25] <doug65536> it must be after your var $menu... line
[13:02:25] <doug65536> which one doesn't work? the initial hide-if-handheld thing, or the hide-if-I-click-menu-item-on-handheld thing? :)
[13:02:36] <dannydagger> both
[13:02:44] <dannydagger> tried after the var menu line too
[13:03:32] <dannydagger> doug65536: shouldnt it be $menu instead of $("#menu") ?
[13:03:42] <doug65536> yes
[13:03:49] <doug65536> both will work, $menu is more efficient though
[13:04:21] <dannydagger> $menu.on..... ?
[13:04:22] <bobbobbins> hey, I'm having trouble with these two binding statementsâ€¦it was working before i made this page an ajax call, i tried switching it to on() but that didn't seem to work eitherâ€¦any help is appreciated https://gist.github.com/bobbobbins/6145470
[13:05:10] <dannydagger> doug65536: doesn't work anyhow mate
[13:06:17] <grafi> bobbobbins so you load that snipped via ajax?
[13:07:11] <bobbobbins> grafi: yeahâ€¦those binds were working when it wasn't loaded that wayâ€¦and on() doesn't seem to work either, even though i attached it to the first wrapper div that isn't ajaxed
[13:07:31] <doug65536> dannydagger: try changing .on(  to .bind(
[13:08:21] <dannydagger> doug65536: no luck
[13:08:24] <grafi> i would think the js should be on the main page
[13:08:45] <bobbobbins> ah, maybe thats the issueâ€¦let me try moving it
[13:09:07] <grafi> dont forget to bind to the parent div then ;)
[13:09:44] <doug65536> dannydagger: change .bind( to .find('a').on(
[13:10:25] <doug65536> if that works, perhaps 'li' instead of 'a'
[13:10:35] <dannydagger> it worked
[13:10:46] <jacta> Is it possible to set "hover" state on images?
[13:11:19] <dannydagger> li didnt work
[13:11:20] <dannydagger> a worked
[13:11:39] <doug65536> 'li, a' is probably best then
[13:11:53] <doug65536> means, attach the click to the li things and the a things
[13:12:23] <dannydagger> doug65536: works great, but it doesnt hide the menu initially
[13:12:23] <doug65536> I'm not sure if the 'a' is the whole area or just the text so 'a' might be all you need
[13:12:23] <bobbobbins> nah, that didn't work, its still doing the same thing, which is it executes once, instead of every time the value changes, and everything comes up as NaN instead of actual values
[13:13:18] <grafi> have a live site?
[13:13:51] <doug65536> after the $menu.find.... line, put if ($(window).width() < breakpoint) $menu.addClass('hide');
[13:13:55] <bobbobbins> grafi: yeahâ€¦you have to go all the way to the last step, but it takes just a few seconds to fill out the stuff: http://166.78.127.31/c4e/round-calculator/
[13:14:06] <doug65536> sorry, 'hidden'
[13:14:33] <doug65536> dannydagger: ^
[13:14:38] <dannydagger> doug65536: i have it that way
[13:14:40] <dannydagger> not working
[13:14:49] <dannydagger>     $menu.find('li, a').on('click', function() { if ($(window).width() < breakpoint) $menu.addClass('hidden'); });
[13:15:01] <doug65536> no
[13:15:05] <doug65536> you need another line
[13:15:11] <dannydagger> oh
[13:15:25] <doug65536> that line you quoted is the click handlers
[13:15:26] <dannydagger> on the next line: if ($(window).width() < breakpoint) $menu.addClass('hide'); ?
[13:15:31] <doug65536> yesw
[13:16:33] <doug65536> not 'hide'
[13:16:39] <doug65536> dannydagger: addClass('hidden')
[13:16:39] <dannydagger> yeah
[13:16:44] <dannydagger> just figured that out :D
[13:16:47] <dannydagger> it works
[13:17:02] <dannydagger> however, it doesnt hide the menu until the site is 100% loaded
[13:17:12] <dannydagger> it shows a quick view of the menu first
[13:17:16] <dannydagger> can that be fixed somehow?
[13:17:52] <doug65536> in the html change it to <nav id="menu" class="hidden">
[13:18:11] <dannydagger> i'll just change #menu to visibility:hidden in the css?
[13:18:13] <doug65536> then change that new line you just added...
[13:18:40] <doug65536>  if ($(window).width() >= breakpoint) $menu.removeClass('hidden');
[13:19:18] <doug65536> dannydagger: no
[13:19:31] <doug65536> dannydagger: all your code depends on whether the class
[13:19:37] <doug65536> 'hidden' is there
[13:19:59] <dannydagger> huh? does it have to be in the html?
[13:20:27] <doug65536> you want it initially invisible right?
[13:20:32] <dannydagger> yes
[13:20:46] <dannydagger> only for mobile
[13:20:48] <dannydagger> not for desktop
[13:20:49] <doug65536> trust me it's easiest to put class="hidden" on the div tag
[13:20:56] <grafi> strange bobbobbins
[13:21:12] <doug65536> if you now suddenly want to do some completely other technique to control it, have fun
[13:21:17] <dannydagger> doug65536: that makes it hidden even for the laptop
[13:22:09] <doug65536> not if you make the change I said earlier: <doug65536>  if ($(window).width() >= breakpoint) $menu.removeClass('hidden');
[13:22:56] <dannydagger> oh sry
[13:23:03] <doug65536> then it is initially invisibile, and upon page ready, if the browser is big enough, make it visible immediately
[13:24:03] <doug65536> dannydagger: just inverting it. instead of it being visible already and saying if small browser hide it, it is already invisible and we're saying if big browser show it
[13:24:13] <dannydagger> yeah
[13:24:15] <dannydagger> works great now
[13:24:20] <dannydagger> massive thanks
[13:24:24] <doug65536> np
[13:25:08] <bobbobbins> yeah, very strange
[13:26:51] <grafi> i guess the first step should be to take out any and all javascript commands from the partials that you load
[13:26:56] <dannydagger> doug65536: do you know how I can disable some jquery functions for mobile device without using jRespond?
[13:27:14] <doug65536> dannydagger: disable what?
[13:27:15] <grafi> and maybe do the init stuff on the ajax success or something
[13:27:32] <dannydagger> masonry and pageslide
[13:27:46] <bobbobbins> grafi: yeah, i'll try that and see if it works
[13:27:59] <grafi> i think putting script tags and js in partials is considered unreliable so that could be a problem
[13:28:09] <grafi> let me know how it works out ;)
[13:28:20] <doug65536> dannydagger: you can... by putting an if around a $.getScript call
[13:29:31] <dannydagger> is it complicated? I have no clue what to write inside that getCcript call :/
[13:30:31] <ravenzz> dannydagger ok here you go http://jsfiddle.net/sEAn3/
[13:32:25] <dannydagger> ravenzz: awesome bro thanks.. I already got it working with doug though.. check it out its updated.. is there any difference between this method that is active right now and yours?
[13:32:26] <ravenzz> this way you don't even need the extra element
[13:32:50] <ravenzz> the #togglewrapper
[13:33:06] <ravenzz> you can use a pseudo element to create the meny button
[13:33:22] <dannydagger> ah ok
[13:33:32] <dannydagger>     #menu:before { display: none; }      <- does this mean invisible until 100% load?
[13:34:25] <doug65536> dannydagger: https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6147877 should only load those two things if browser is big at start
[13:34:31] <ravenzz> well seems like you are using modernizr which removes the no-js class if javascript is working
[13:34:52] <doug65536> replaces the first if ($(window... thing
[13:35:06] <ravenzz> in case js doesn't work or it is disable ... that's make sure that you have a nice and working menu
[13:36:01] <doug65536> dannydagger: also, remove the script tags that load those from html, the js loads them if you apply that change
[13:36:06] <dannydagger> ravenzz: what do you mean.. your version? instead of the one active now? will look good even if js is disabled?
[13:36:16] <dannydagger> doug65536: gonna check it out
[13:36:21] <ravenzz> dannydagger yes
[13:36:50] <ravenzz> or at least it should if I didn't anything wrong
[13:37:25] <dannydagger> ravenzz: ok thanks
[13:37:56] <dannydagger> doug65536: which script tags? kinda confused too hot in here plus too much code lol
[13:38:04] <ravenzz> also you may want to check this tiny plugin I made for debounced resize events
[13:38:08] <ravenzz> https://github.com/giuseppeg/jQuery-resizeEnd
[13:38:11] <doug65536> dannydagger: near end of html
[13:38:35] <dannydagger> doug65536: ah ok i get it
[13:38:47] <dannydagger> ravenzz: gonna check it out
[13:39:04] <okdamn> hi sorry how do i get the mouse x and y coordinates inside an element on click?
[13:39:26] <okdamn> i mean x and y relative to the element i'm in
[13:39:58] <ravenzz> read this article to understand what I am talking about http://davidwalsh.name/function-debounce
[13:43:28] <doug65536> okdamn: function(e) { /* use e.pageX, e.pageY */ }
[13:43:49] <doug65536> okdamn: I guess you would need to subtract off the element's position() .left .top
[13:44:31] <okdamn> doug65536:  i have a div which is width:!00%; and height:500px;
[13:44:43] <okdamn> when i'm inside that div i click and get pageY and pageX
[13:45:07] <okdamn> but then positioning an absolute element on those coordinates it doesn't get the same position :(
[13:45:13] <okdamn> check i'll paste you my code
[13:45:52] <okdamn> doug65536:  http://pastebin.com/cSypjwme
[13:46:01] <okdamn> i would like to get % percentage
[13:46:19] <okdamn> so this returns 50% pageY and 30% pageX
[13:46:35] <okdamn> but when i add css rules using same values for margin left and margin top
[13:46:45] <okdamn> the element is not in same position where i cliked at
[13:46:46] <okdamn> :(
[13:46:49] <dannydagger> doug65536: ajaxSetup cache true what is that for in the link u pasted?
[13:46:51] <okdamn> understood?
[13:47:52] <doug65536> dannydagger: allows the browser to use cache. without it it will force download every time
[13:48:27] <okdamn> how can i get percentage? when click inside element, get percentage x and y of the mouse position
[13:48:32] <okdamn> is this possible?
[13:48:34] <dannydagger> doug65536: ah ok I didnt have that already somewher?
[13:48:35] <okdamn> i tryed this http://pastebin.com/cSypjwme
[13:48:36] <dannydagger> somewhere*
[13:48:43] <okdamn> but i don't think it's quite ok
[13:48:49] <doug65536> okdamn: I'm trying to get a fiddle working for you
[13:49:04] <okdamn> doug65536:  thanks man you are saving my life
[13:52:14] <dannydagger> doug65536: adding those lines screwed up all my other js.. the pageslide is flickering at load.. maybe I added it at the wrong place.. check it out i updated the site www.colorworld.se/testing123
[13:52:28] <doug65536> okdamn: http://jsfiddle.net/HydUK/1/
[13:53:12] <doug65536> okdamn: http://jsfiddle.net/HydUK/2/
[13:53:32] <dannydagger> doug65536: sry, now it's updated.. uploaded the wrong files the first attempt
[13:53:53] <okdamn> doug65536:  thanks i'm checking, also making jsfiddle for you ;)
[13:55:17] <doug65536> dannydagger: you need to put checks in a couple of places probably... 1 sec...
[13:56:26] <doug65536> dannydagger: wrap the following if around line 61 62 : if ($.pageSlide) { /* those 2 lines */ }
[13:56:27] <okdamn> doug65536:  http://jsfiddle.net/spCpB/
[13:56:45] <okdamn> this is what i'm trying to achieve, do you see the element has no same mouse position when moving mouse pointer?
[13:58:00] <okdamn> i would like to make this accurate as much as possible
[13:58:46] <dannydagger> doug65536: ok great thanks.. i guess the github code should be below the breakpoint thing?
[13:59:19] <doug65536> yes, replaces the line that removeClass('hidden') (notice it is in the new code)
[14:00:17] <dannydagger> $(window).on('resize', function () { //settings } <- that?
[14:00:45] <okdamn> doug65536:  http://jsfiddle.net/spCpB/
[14:00:47] <okdamn> :P
[14:00:53] <okdamn> what about dude?
[14:02:20] <dannydagger> doug65536: do you mean your whole github code should be on line 10?
[14:03:48] <doug65536> dannydagger: line 16
[14:03:52] <MarkyC> Is there a way to get the /last/ element of a selector in JQuery?
[14:04:07] <grafi> :last?
[14:04:09] <doug65536> dannydagger: oh, you changed it I guess
[14:04:27] <doug65536> okdamn: why do you want to specify position as a percentage?
[14:04:35] <doug65536> okdamn: asking for trouble imho
[14:04:53] <okdamn> doug65536:  cause i need to position span in position absolute
[14:05:15] <okdamn> so i need percentage relative to the div element
[14:05:16] <MarkyC> grafi: I have a table and the first rows are marked "hidden", <tr class='hidden'>...</tr><tr class='hidden'>...</tr><tr class='not-hidden'>...</tr>. I want to insert a row after the last tr.hidden (before the tr.non-hidden)
[14:05:17] <dannydagger> doug65536: i updated the site.. check it out now does it look correct?
[14:05:18] <okdamn> for the span element
[14:06:24] <doug65536> okdamn: http://jsfiddle.net/spCpB/7/
[14:07:07] <grafi> $('table').find('tr.hidden:last').append() something like that i think
[14:07:23] <doug65536> okdamn: http://jsfiddle.net/spCpB/8/
[14:07:30] <okdamn> doug65536:  yeah but the main problem is i MUST use position absolute for the span
[14:07:36] <okdamn> have you clue ? :P
[14:07:43] <doug65536> okdamn: ok use absolute, it will work
[14:08:04] <doug65536> okdamn: http://jsfiddle.net/spCpB/9/
[14:08:40] <doug65536> dannydagger: it looks right
[14:08:40] <okdamn> doug65536:  ok ;) and what about percentage? the div can have fluid width so it depends on window with
[14:08:45] <cameron262> why does my data-header-theme="d" do nothing?
[14:08:50] <cameron262> in jquery mobile
[14:08:59] <dannydagger> doug65536: no, it doesn't load pageslide
[14:08:59] <okdamn> i need percentage so if div is larger the span is positioned in percentage
[14:09:47] <doug65536> okdamn: ok now it gets the size of the div every event
[14:09:51] <doug65536> okdamn: http://jsfiddle.net/spCpB/11/
[14:09:53] <dannydagger> doug65536: when you press the masonry images, nothing happens.. something wrong with pageslide
[14:10:21] <doug65536> dannydagger: you need an if around the code that calls masonry
[14:10:36] <doug65536> dannydagger: line 69
[14:10:49] <okdamn> doug65536:  uhmm http://jsfiddle.net/spCpB/12/
[14:10:56] <okdamn> can you check this pls
[14:11:18] <dannydagger> doug65536: if ($.masonry)  {} ?
[14:11:19] <doug65536> dannydagger: schoolwork?
[14:11:31] <doug65536> you HAVE to use % position?
[14:11:34] <doug65536> good luck with that
[14:11:52] <doug65536> dannydagger: oops wrong person
[14:11:58] <dannydagger> yeah i figured :)
[14:12:12] <okdamn> doug65536:  uh? to me? :P
[14:12:18] <doug65536> okdamn: why do you have to use % position?
[14:12:28] <doug65536> okdamn: it's obviously not working
[14:12:31] <okdamn> doug65536:  cause the div background is an image
[14:12:31] <dannydagger> doug65536: does that if mean i have to remove $(window).load(function () { ?
[14:12:38] <dannydagger> on line 66
[14:12:43] <okdamn> and i need to position span on an image specific point
[14:12:55] <okdamn> i mean resizing the span should be in same position relative to the image too
[14:12:58] <cameron262> why does my data-header-theme="d" do nothing?
[14:13:00] <cameron262> in jquery mobile
[14:13:54] <doug65536> okdamn: yes but % position is obviously not taking a percentage of the div, it's a percentage of the whole page, right?
[14:14:32] <okdamn> doug65536:  yep i guess true
[14:14:36] <okdamn> :(
[14:14:51] <doug65536> okdamn: which is why my fiddle doesn't bother and "manually" does it
[14:15:19] <okdamn> doug65536:  but my problem is that i can't use fixed positions, i need fluid positioning
[14:15:20] <okdamn> :(
[14:15:36] <okdamn> i can recalculate pixels according to the percentage !? what you say?
[14:15:37] <okdamn> will fix?
[14:16:01] <doug65536> what is fixed? I put stuff outside it for performance. here's one that always works: http://jsfiddle.net/spCpB/13/
[14:16:09] <okdamn> if only could i get the percentage relative to the div ufff
[14:16:33] <okdamn> doug65536:  nope you use 'left': x + 'px',
[14:16:34] <okdamn>         'top': y + 'px'
[14:16:37] <okdamn> i can't :(
[14:16:43] <doug65536> why can't you
[14:16:52] <doug65536> watch this:
[14:16:53] <okdamn> cause on page refresh with different resolution you'll see the span somewhere else
[14:17:10] <okdamn> while percentage fits always the same
[14:17:15] <okdamn> yeah...
[14:17:39] <dannydagger> doug65536: let me know when u have some time
[14:17:40] <okdamn> cause i store in db both x and y and then show the element everytime you refresh page
[14:17:46] <doug65536> okdamn: no, you don't understand how absolute works. if the parent is positioned with relative or something, then 0,0 is the top left of it
[14:18:01] <okdamn> doug65536:  indeed
[14:18:07] <okdamn> uhmm
[14:18:18] <okdamn> x offset is 0 since the div is 10% wide
[14:18:21] <okdamn> *100%
[14:18:26] <okdamn> problem is the y
[14:18:29] <doug65536> okdamn: http://jsfiddle.net/spCpB/14/
[14:18:30] <okdamn> i guess ufff what a hell
[14:19:09] <okdamn> doug65536:  ok now try , on click leave the span where it is
[14:19:12] <okdamn> then resize window
[14:19:20] <okdamn> make it bigger
[14:19:23] <doug65536> okdamn: ok this reveals your problem http://jsfiddle.net/spCpB/15/
[14:19:49] <doug65536> okdamn: and this fixes it http://jsfiddle.net/spCpB/16/
[14:20:27] <doug65536> dannydagger: ok, what is wrong again? sorry
[14:20:29] <okdamn> doug65536:  http://jsfiddle.net/spCpB/17/
[14:20:48] <dannydagger> doug65536: you said i should put "if" masonry something
[14:21:00] <okdamn> doug65536:  why percentage won't works????
[14:21:02] <okdamn> uffff
[14:21:09] <dannydagger> doug65536: when you click the images, the pageslide doesn't work
[14:21:18] <doug65536> okdamn: screw percentage! :) it doesn't work right?
[14:21:43] <okdamn> nope :(
[14:22:02] <doug65536> okdamn: did you look at my fiddle? it is exactly what you want
[14:22:08] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/spCpB/16/
[14:22:40] <doug65536> dannydagger: yes put an if around that whole $(window).load thing
[14:22:42] <okdamn> doug65536:  blah
[14:22:57] <dannydagger> if what?
[14:23:09] <dannydagger> if ($.masonry)  {} ?
[14:23:12] <okdamn> doug65536:  now i let you check one thing sec
[14:23:18] <okdamn> why this is wrong
[14:23:32] <doug65536> dannydagger: if ($('#itemwrapper').masonry) { ... that stuff .. }
[14:23:32] <okdamn> nah uff thank you
[14:23:38] <okdamn> i'll get depressed fixing this
[14:23:40] <okdamn> don't worry sorry
[14:23:46] <okdamn> pffff what a hell
[14:24:00] <doug65536> dannydagger: until line 76
[14:24:23] <doug65536> okdamn: why must you use percentage? homework?
[14:24:38] <okdamn> doug65536:  yes
[14:24:44] <okdamn> test
[14:24:47] <okdamn> :(
[14:25:18] <doug65536> cool, ask your teacher for me why they make you do stuff in stupid ways that don't work and get back to me
[14:25:25] <dannydagger> doug65536: doesnt work, should i upload?
[14:25:31] <doug65536> dannydagger: yes
[14:25:46] <dannydagger> done, www.colorworld.se/testing123
[14:26:39] <doug65536> okdamn: there you go: http://jsfiddle.net/spCpB/18/
[14:26:56] <doug65536> okdamn: had to put position: relative on span so it is relative to parent :P
[14:26:59] <dannydagger> doug65536: it is displaying the .slide-page when you hover on the initial page too
[14:27:18] <dannydagger> for some strange reason
[14:27:44] <okdamn> doug65536:  oh oh oh now seems rly ok dude
[14:27:46] <okdamn> thanks!!!!!
[14:28:39] <doug65536> dannydagger: that shuld do it
[14:29:11] <dannydagger> what should do it?
[14:29:34] <doug65536> dannydagger: sorry, what is slide-page
[14:30:08] <doug65536> dannydagger: I need to go to the store real quick. I'll be back in 15 minutes or so
[14:30:14] <dannydagger> doug65536: when you hover on the initial page, you see a black-opacity page overlapping the initial page righT?
[14:30:15] <dannydagger> ok
[14:33:11] <armi> So im reading high performance javascript and in it I read that innrerHTML is slower than DOM methods for Chrome 3 and Safari 4. Is this a trend? Does the current FF have this beahviour to>?
[14:34:22] <tw2113> that's a version of safari that's 2 versions old. and Chrome's version is in the mid 20s now
[14:34:39] <grafi> mid?
[14:34:42] <tw2113> correction, 28, so late 20s
[14:34:47] <grafi> ha!
[14:34:53] <grafi> im the version wizard
[14:34:57] <tw2113> chrome's version is almost as old as i am, and is aging faster too
[14:35:08] <grafi> looks better though *runs*
[14:35:10] <armi> but then still do all newer versions exert the same behaviour.
[14:36:16] <armi> does the current FF perform better with innerHTML for example, or has it too shifted to DOM methods being faster
[14:37:46] <grafi> how much slower is slower? does it say?
[14:39:44] <armi> grafi http://snag.gy/kUepd.jpg
[14:40:23] <armi> "The benefit of using innerHTML over DOM methods to create a 1,000 row table"
[14:41:02] <grafi> so creating 1000 row table in ie6 with innerhtml is 4 times faster?
[14:41:42] <tw2113> dunno about everyone else, but i'd look for current reports on such a topic
[14:41:50] <grafi> probably
[14:42:18] <grafi> 1.x times faster/slower doesnt seem like much difference though
[14:42:22] <tw2113> there have been tons of js performance gains in probably all browsers since the ones listed there
[14:43:20] <armi> I was just wondering if this a/(was?) trend, DOM methods outperforming innerHTML.
[14:43:39] <grafi> not that i know of, or ever heard of xP
[14:43:48] <grafi> of course that doesnt mean anything
[14:43:57] <armi> haha ;p
[14:43:58] <doug65536> dom methods should be faster though - no parsing
[14:44:14] * tw2113 copies over everything from DVD to 3TB hdd
[14:44:22] <doug65536> no or less parsing anyway
[14:45:02] <armi> hmm, why would there be less, it still has to be translated to html? so the implicit element creation through DOM is faster?
[14:45:03] <grafi> yeah in general
[14:45:15] <doug65536> tw2113: with 1000 rows, I would expect a document fragment to blow away giant innerHTML string
[14:45:15] <grafi> but by how much is interesting
[14:45:16] <grafi> :P
[14:45:21] <armi> meaning that to html is faster than raw parsing html
[14:47:34] <armi> I want it to werk in IE 5.5 to so thats not an option
[14:47:40] <armi> work*
[14:47:48] <doug65536> lol IE 5,5
[14:47:52] <grafi> ie 5.5
[14:47:53] <grafi> oÃ´
[14:47:53] <armi> but thanks for the insight.
[14:48:01] <grafi> you poor soul?
[14:48:18] <tw2113> the torture...it burns
[14:48:33] <dannydagger> doug65536: I'm back now, are you?
[14:48:41] <doug65536> armi: you're kidding right? why in the world would anyone want to support ie 5.5
[14:48:43] <doug65536> dannydagger: yes
[14:48:44] <grafi> i didnt know 5.5 even still existed xD
[14:48:56] <tw2113> i thought IE6 was the first version of IE
[14:49:05] <grafi> xD
[14:49:06] <tw2113> it was so awesome at the time, it skipped 1-5
[14:49:15] <dannydagger> doug65536: alrighty.. so I did what you said but that made the masonry not work.. and also pageslide doesnt work
[14:49:23] <grafi> i propose all browser have an expiration date
[14:49:34] <doug65536> dannydagger: let me step through it...
[14:49:36] <grafi> hardcoded
[14:49:37] <dannydagger> alright
[14:49:37] <grafi> <:
[14:49:43] <tw2113> i stopped worrying about IE6 a couple years back
[14:50:38] <grafi> :)
[14:50:48] <grafi> thats when the nightmares stopped?
[14:50:49] <grafi> ^^
[14:52:12] <tw2113> i wish dvd drives would reallocate copy speeds when parts get finishes
[14:52:15] <tw2113> finished*
[14:52:36] <doug65536> dannydagger: it's not loading those scripts as far as I can tell so far
[14:52:51] <tw2113> or at least to a bigger degree than they appear to
[14:52:59] <dannydagger> doug65536: hmm, have i placed the load code at the wrong place?
[14:53:09] <doug65536> dannydagger: no it looks right
[14:53:17] <doug65536> dannydagger: let me make 100% sure it never loads
[14:53:35] <dannydagger> ok
[14:53:48] <doug65536> dannydagger: pageslide is making it fade like that?
[14:53:52] <doug65536> on mouseover?
[14:54:20] <armi> instead of jquery, only plain vanilla js cross-browser ftw
[14:54:20] <dannydagger> doug65536: it's beacause it's not loaded.. it is top:0 absolute.. some errors i will fix later in the css
[14:54:25] <doug65536> dannydagger: what problem am I solving again? :)
[14:54:40] <dannydagger> doug65536: the pageslide didn't work hehe.. when you click the masonry images
[14:54:49] <dannydagger> but right now the masonry isnt working either
[14:54:54] <dannydagger> after adding those "if" lines
[14:55:07] <doug65536> dannydagger: I only speak english. what masonry images?
[14:55:30] <dannydagger> masonry is a plugin.. the images when you click portfolio
[14:56:14] <adavia> hey guys is it correct how im setting the data in this ajax request? http://jsfiddle.net/ZRGu2/1/
[14:56:37] <doug65536> what is supposed to happen when I click the tablet image?
[14:56:50] <dannydagger> the page from the left should slide in
[14:57:07] <grafi> adavia you cant have multiple elements with the same id
[14:57:10] <dannydagger> doug65536: like here colorworld.se/ramzi
[14:58:08] <doug65536> dannydagger: yes but you wanted to disable it for handhelds
[14:58:17] <dannydagger> doug65536: yes but it doesnt work on laptop
[14:58:36] <doug65536> oh ok... now I know what the problem is!
[14:58:39] <dannydagger> hehe
[14:58:42] <dannydagger> awesome
[14:59:01] <adavia> grafi: actually is the same input in a loop
[14:59:20] <grafi> adavia http://jsfiddle.net/ZRGu2/2/ .serializeArray() works though, although you should put those form elements inside a form
[15:00:13] <adavia> grafi: wont work if there
[15:00:20] <adavia> they are not in a form?
[15:04:32] <doug65536> dannydagger: oh I see what's wrong...
[15:04:35] <grafi> wont work where?
[15:04:42] <dannydagger> oh nice, what?
[15:04:45] <grafi> they are not in <form> tags
[15:07:03] <doug65536> dannydagger: 1 sec
[15:08:34] <doug65536> dannydagger: replace line 66 thru 76 with https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148172
[15:09:19] <doug65536> dannydagger: what was happening was it was trying to look at #itemwrapper before it existed
[15:09:24] <cameron262> #jquerymobile-dev
[15:09:26] <cameron262> oops
[15:10:58] <hye> hi
[15:11:11] <dannydagger> doug65536: site is updated, still doesnt work :(
[15:11:42] <hye> i have a click event handler for checkboxes... when a checkbox is clicked, it does some processing that takes up to 3 seconds to complete.  how can i provide the user with instant results instead of waiting for the processing to complete before checking the checkbox?
[15:14:38] <doug65536> dannydagger: where is masonry initialized?
[15:14:49] <doug65536> dannydagger: I don't see the js-masonry class used anywhere
[15:15:54] <dannydagger> doug65536: i dont follow? i thought it is enough to initialize it in the js line 69 and below
[15:16:06] <dannydagger> do i need a js-masonry class too?
[15:16:27] <doug65536> which element is the masonry "container" supposed to be?
[15:16:37] <dannydagger> #portfolio
[15:16:57] <dannydagger> no sorry
[15:16:59] <dannydagger> #itemwrapper
[15:17:05] <dannydagger> it is inside portfolio
[15:18:59] <doug65536> move line 24 down to line 26
[15:19:05] <doug65536> dannydagger: load masonry after jquery
[15:19:36] <doug65536> dannydagger: wait nevermind...
[15:19:39] <doug65536> that doens't matter
[15:19:46] <dannydagger> ah ok
[15:20:14] <dannydagger> the main problem is
[15:20:21] <dannydagger> that pageslide doesnt seem to load
[15:21:01] <doug65536> dannydagger: it loads
[15:21:12] <doug65536> dannydagger: what browser are you using?
[15:21:20] <dannydagger> chrome and ff
[15:22:51] <amb1s1> I never done any jquery, but I'm developing a python website and I love this design: http://poncho.is/ . I would like to know if this website is design using jquery
[15:23:34] <doug65536> dannydagger: it loads pageslide, whether it works is another matter
[15:23:50] <dannydagger> doug65536: strange :/
[15:24:42] <doug65536> ok, try initializing masonry the usual way...
[15:24:44] <doug65536> 1 sec
[15:26:27] <dannydagger> sure
[15:31:16] <doug65536> dannydagger: this should work better https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148172
[15:32:18] <dannydagger> updated the site with it
[15:32:24] <dannydagger> it doesn't load the pageslides
[15:32:38] <dannydagger> but now the hover problem on the initial page is not there
[15:37:47] <nsanden> so i have a div with a checkbox inside it and some jquery that checks the checkbox when i click anywhere inside the div. problem is, if i click the checkbox, it appears nothing happens (box wont ever get checked).
[15:38:01] <nsanden> i assume it is checking it, and then unchecking it at the same time
[15:39:21] <nsanden> anyone have any tips for fixing that
[15:40:55] <doug65536> dannydagger: I think I found it
[15:41:33] <dannydagger> where mate?
[15:44:31] <doug65536> dannydagger: get rid of that whole thing and update the part near the top with https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148172
[15:44:50] <doug65536> rid of thing at line 65
[15:45:43] <doug65536> part near top is line 19
[15:46:00] <dannydagger> ok gonna try
[15:47:50] <dannydagger> doug65536: that doesn't work either =(
[15:47:55] <dannydagger> i'll upload it w8
[15:48:03] <dannydagger> done
[15:48:43] <hye> question: when i wrap my jquery code in setTimeOut I get this error:   Unable to get property 'toLowerCase' of undefined or null reference
[15:48:45] <hye> any reason why?
[15:49:33] <dannydagger> doug65536 oops sry i removed the pageslide thing too
[15:51:15] <dannydagger> doug65536: updated the site again, still doesn't work
[15:51:58] <doug65536> dannydagger: yes but that change works, by "works" I mean it is initializing Masonry now
[15:53:03] <dannydagger> ah ok.. it wasn't initializing masonry befor?
[15:53:05] <dannydagger> before*
[15:53:08] <doug65536> no
[15:53:14] <dannydagger> yikes :D
[15:53:14] <doug65536> it wasn't
[15:53:49] <dannydagger> thanks bro.. this pageslide thing is wierd though
[15:54:27] <dannydagger> maybe the plugin doesnt work with masonry? now that it is initialized
[15:54:56] <dannydagger> because if you see on www.colorworld.se/ramzi/ when you click the masonry images a slide comes from the left
[15:56:48] <doug65536> dannydagger: pageslide needs to be fixed too...
[15:57:22] <dannydagger> how do you mean?
[15:58:49] <doug65536> remove lines 55 thru 58 and update top thing https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148172
[15:59:34] <dannydagger> tadaaaaaaa
[15:59:37] <dannydagger> works like a charm
[15:59:46] <dannydagger> you're a genious
[15:59:52] <foo> I want to limit the characters on title. Is it better to A) autoset title and create a CCK field for title, or B) find something to autoset chars in title?
[15:59:55] <dannydagger> updated the site now
[15:59:57] <doug65536> dannydagger: lol
[16:00:35] <foo> whoops, wrong window
[16:01:16] <doug65536> dannydagger: now, if only someone would pay me for this stuff lol
[16:01:22] <dannydagger> doug65536: check it out.. when you scroll over the masonry images.. the navbar is not sticky to the top anymore.. well it is, but the top:0 is getting some margin it seems.. it is only when you scroll up and down over the masonry images.. what could be causing that?
[16:01:29] <dannydagger> doug65536: come to sweden i'll get you some hot blondes! D:
[16:01:44] <dannydagger> always a start :)
[16:03:07] <doug65536> dannydagger: it isn't happening for me... what exactly do you mean "scroll over the masonry images"?
[16:03:18] <doug65536> click them?
[16:04:01] <dannydagger> not click them.. when you scroll the page.. from the top to the bottom.. when you pass the masonry images, the navbar is losing some glue from the top of the window.. it is a minor visual effect not easy to notice perhaps
[16:04:17] <doug65536> maybe my computer is too fast?
[16:04:47] <doug65536> dannydagger: I'm testing in firefox
[16:05:05] <dannydagger> gonna check in ff
[16:05:22] <dannydagger> ah
[16:05:24] <dannydagger> works fine in ff
[16:05:29] <dannydagger> u have chrome installed?
[16:05:44] <doug65536> dannydagger: yes
[16:06:06] <dannydagger> check it out in chrome you might see it
[16:06:32] <doug65536> dannydagger: nope
[16:06:41] <doug65536> you refreshed right?
[16:06:52] <dannydagger> yes i did.. it is above the navbar
[16:07:00] <dannydagger> at the top of the navbar
[16:10:13] <dannydagger> doug65536: nevermind.. it is a minor visual error
[16:10:26] <dannydagger> i am really grateful for the other stuff though
[16:10:38] <doug65536> dannydagger: I scrolled like crazy before this screenshot
[16:10:42] <doug65536> http://www.pasteall.org/pic/56791
[16:11:46] <doug65536> dannydagger: is the problem showing in my screenshot?
[16:12:25] <doug65536> dannydagger: np
[16:13:09] <dannydagger> http://www.pasteall.org/pic/56792
[16:13:10] <dannydagger> check that out
[16:13:15] <dannydagger> the problem is showing there
[16:13:26] <dannydagger> above the navbar
[16:13:56] <doug65536> dannydagger: yes I see. I'm using linux... that probably isn't the difference though
[16:14:27] <doug65536> dannydagger: try this:
[16:14:38] <doug65536> dannydagger: press F12 and click the little arrow over the box near the left
[16:14:49] <doug65536> dannydagger: then click the thing at the top
[16:15:26] <doug65536> dannydagger: oh.. sorry chrome is different...
[16:15:41] <nesoi> what could cause a situation where $('#divname').text(textvalue) works the first time a page is loaded, but then doesn't work again after that?
[16:16:00] <doug65536> dannydagger: in f12, go to elements tab, click the little magnifying glass at the bottom, then click the navbar
[16:16:33] <dannydagger> ok
[16:16:34] <dannydagger> sec
[16:16:54] <dannydagger> i have no elements tab.. only console, html, css script and dom
[16:16:58] <dannydagger> maybe i need some developer tools?
[16:18:22] <nesoi> anyone have an idea?
[16:18:55] <doug65536> dannydagger: I have version 28. not sure when they started to include that by default
[16:19:06] <doug65536> dannydagger: anyway, I'm not seeing a fixed position...
[16:19:18] <dannydagger> when i click f12 in chrome it opens firebug
[16:19:48] <doug65536> dannydagger: it is position: fixed right?
[16:19:55] <dannydagger> .sticky {    position:fixed;} line 1364 in the css
[16:19:56] <dannydagger> yes
[16:20:36] <dannydagger> it only does that over the masonry images
[16:21:05] <doug65536> dannydagger: what version of chrome are you running?
[16:21:09] <doug65536> dannydagger: seems like a bug
[16:21:30] <doug65536> click that goofy menu button and click About Chrome
[16:21:48] <dannydagger> 28
[16:21:53] <doug65536> weird
[16:22:01] <dannydagger> yeah
[16:22:02] <doug65536> I can try in a windows VM... 1 sec
[16:22:07] <dannydagger> sure thx
[16:23:03] <nesoi> what could cause a situation where $('#divname').text(textvalue) works the first time a page is loaded, but then doesn't work again after that? I've tried .html as wellâ€¦ anyone with an idea?
[16:24:15] <doug65536> nesoi: an error causes browser to abandon rest of script after the first call
[16:24:35] <doug65536> nesoi: link?
[16:24:37] <spectrahp> nesoi: like doug65536 said. maybe post a jsfiddle?
[16:25:04] <spectrahp> nesoi: either way use firebug if you're not already
[16:25:29] <spectrahp> Quick question: If there's an element that I already selected and now I have it as a variable, and I want to select specific children of that element, what's the syntax? (I tried searching but I don't know what to search for..)
[16:25:52] <doug65536> dannydagger: wow it's not doing it in my windows vm either
[16:26:41] <dannydagger> doug65536: my friend says the same
[16:26:47] <dannydagger> my computer then
[16:26:48] <dannydagger> :D
[16:27:19] <doug65536> spectrahp: find
[16:27:42] <spectrahp> doug65536: thanks, I just saw that here too: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1155192/variable-and-jquery-selector
[16:27:47] <doug65536> spectrahp: var s = $('#something'); var t = s.find('a');
[16:28:08] <dannydagger> doug65536: final question then I wont annoy you anymore tonight.. my main.js is looking all ok now right? because i am getting 68% errors in jslint in brackets
[16:28:49] <dabear> dannydagger: use jshint.com and then if you want to be more strict, use jslint
[16:29:02] <doug65536> dannydagger: can you create a gist of jslint output at http://gist.github.com
[16:29:50] <nesoi> spectrahp:  this is a jqm android app. I can't use firebug
[16:29:57] <doug65536> spectrahp: you can search both ways, up and down the hierarchy
[16:30:25] <doug65536> spectrahp: to search "back" to the closest parent div: s.closest('div')
[16:30:55] <doug65536> spectrahp: parent will keep going
[16:30:57] <dannydagger> doug65536: like this? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/dcda5459a73382c98434
[16:31:09] <doug65536> spectrahp: next will search forward for first match
[16:31:13] <spectrahp> nesoi: you certainly can. it's just html/css/js. open it in your browser
[16:31:19] <doug65536> dannydagger: yes
[16:31:43] <spectrahp> doug65536: thanks, i haven't used these before but they might come in handy
[16:31:46] <dannydagger> are there any critical errors?
[16:32:36] <doug65536> dannydagger: yes that first one is pretty bad. the end of var breakpoint line shouldn't be a comma, it should be ;
[16:32:51] <nesoi> spectrahp:  it's using loads of phone api calls
[16:33:03] <dannydagger> ah ok
[16:33:55] <dannydagger> Missing "use strict" statement. is that anything important?
[16:33:57] <doug65536> dannydagger: line 6 one is it trying to impose its style on you. $ not defined ones are bogus.
[16:34:45] <dannydagger> line 6 trying to impose its style on me? what does that mean?
[16:34:47] <spectrahp> nesoi: i see
[16:34:49] <doug65536> dannydagger: try putting "use strict"; at top of that script
[16:35:16] <doug65536> dannydagger: "strict mode" makes the browser extremely picky about your script - to help find bugs
[16:35:42] <spectrahp> nesoi: what i would do in that situation is try to isolate the error by removing chunks of functionality until it works, and then slowly adding it back
[16:35:56] <doug65536> dannydagger: jslint wants you to put {} around the if body. it's not necessary
[16:36:26] <spectrahp> nesoi: there's phonegap debug, though when i tried to use it once, it was not very inviting
[16:36:43] <dannydagger> doug65536: adding "use strict" then it says " use the function form of "use strict" "
[16:36:52] <nesoi> I'm trying itâ€¦ weinreâ€¦ it doesn't even show the content area of the page at all. very odd
[16:37:18] <doug65536> (function () {
[16:37:18] <doug65536>    "use strict";
[16:37:18] <doug65536>    // this function is strict...
[16:37:18] <doug65536> }());
[16:37:30] <dannydagger> thanks
[16:37:33] <doug65536> dannydagger: ignore that warning
[16:37:46] <dannydagger> ok, I shouldn't use strict?
[16:38:40] <doug65536> does use strict break the page?
[16:38:42] <doug65536> it could
[16:38:43] <dannydagger> yeah
[16:38:44] <dannydagger> it does
[16:39:04] <doug65536> did yu update the site?
[16:39:08] <doug65536> you*
[16:39:14] <dannydagger> no, just locally.. is it important to use strict?
[16:39:22] <doug65536> it can help find bugs
[16:39:44] <dannydagger> how do you mean? for me as a developer? or for the user and fix them automatically?
[16:39:46] <doug65536> but no, if you're happy with it it's not important
[16:39:51] <doug65536> for developer
[16:40:02] <doug65536> it can also help break the page :)
[16:40:10] <dannydagger> hehe ok screw it then
[16:40:17] <nesoi> spectrahp:  in weinre I only see the page and the footer. I don't see the header or content area at all.
[16:40:26] <doug65536> devs generally want anything wrong to blow up - so they can fix it
[16:40:45] <dannydagger> i'll just upload it so u can see it though
[16:41:15] <dannydagger> done
[16:41:19] <nesoi> so that's no help at allâ€¦
[16:41:34] <nesoi> Anyone else? What could cause a situation where $('#divname').text(textvalue) works the first time a page is loaded, but then doesn't work again after that? I've tried .html as wellâ€¦ anyone with an idea?
[16:42:33] <doug65536> dannydagger: add var before $menu
[16:42:46] <doug65536> dannydagger: var $menu = $('#menu');
[16:42:55] <spectrahp> nesoi: youre using jqm? im not sure, but maybe jqm modifies certain elements (though I don't think it does that to any div's.. maybe im wrong)
[16:43:00] <doug65536> dannydagger: and update site again :)
[16:43:15] <spectrahp> nesoi: also check your code for any other places you are modifying #divname
[16:43:39] <dannydagger> doug65536: done
[16:43:44] <doug65536> dannydagger: also, put the use strict thing at the very start of the page, before $( thing
[16:44:15] <dannydagger> updated again
[16:45:06] <doug65536> dannydagger: it caught a bug at line 51
[16:45:06] <nesoi> spectrahp ok I got it to display. What's happening is that I have it defined like <div id='outer'><div id='inner'></div></div>
[16:45:19] <nesoi> and after the first time it's <div id='outer'><div id='inner'>my text</div></div>
[16:45:38] <nesoi> and then after I replace the text somehow it looks like <div id='outer'></div></div>
[16:45:40] <nesoi> wtf?
[16:45:44] <dannydagger> doug65536: oh?
[16:46:18] <nesoi> or actually just
[16:46:24] <nesoi> <div id='outer'><div id='inner'></div>
[16:46:31] <nesoi> that is, the entire div is gone somehow
[16:46:47] <doug65536> dannydagger: $(this).data("section") is undefined
[16:46:58] <spectrahp> nesoi: without seeing your code, hard to help
[16:47:24] <hye> i have a settimeout at 0.  any reason why it still blocks the thread in jquery mobile?
[16:47:24] <doug65536> dannydagger: which object has class "scroller"
[16:47:35] <nesoi> the code is just $('mydiv').text('mytext');
[16:47:37] <nesoi> that's it
[16:47:39] <nesoi> one line
[16:47:45] <dannydagger> doug65536: all the links that enables smooth scrolling, wait
[16:47:56] <dannydagger> all the links in the menu
[16:47:59] <dannydagger> all buttons
[16:48:14] <dannydagger> and all the links in the footer
[16:48:40] <dannydagger> and also the masonry images
[16:48:41] <nesoi> how can that be deleting the div?
[16:48:56] <dannydagger> or sry the masonry images dont
[16:49:05] <hye> i use the following:  setTimeout(function (e) {somefunction(e);}, 0);  in the web version its fine since it won't block the thread while 'somefunction' runs.  but in mobile, it still blocks the thread.. any ideas? maybe the timeout is too low? will try that now
[16:49:07] <doug65536> dannydagger: I see... I think I know a fix
[16:49:18] <dannydagger> cool
[16:51:07] <nesoi> oh I see it
[16:51:19] <nesoi> as usual I was being dumb
[16:51:23] <nesoi> thanks and nevermind
[16:53:15] <doug65536> dannydagger: replace lines 48 thru 54 https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148444
[16:54:31] <dannydagger> done and updated, what did that actually do?
[16:54:48] <doug65536> it was trying to scroll to sections and it didn't get a section name
[16:54:54] <dannydagger> ah ok
[16:54:56] <doug65536> so it was bombing out of the event handler silently
[16:55:07] <dannydagger> oh ok
[16:55:20] <dannydagger> now everything looks ok in main.js?
[16:55:34] <Dinho> Pessoal tenho um job pra finalizar ate segunda. preciso de um freela de css jquery para ir arrumando os elementos que estou criando e colocando no site.
[16:55:49] <doug65536> dannydagger: I think I broke it... 1 sec
[16:55:57] <dannydagger> hehe ok
[16:57:11] <doug65536> dannydagger: nope, was ok. still checking stuff..
[16:58:04] <dannydagger> ok :)
[16:58:06] <doug65536> dannydagger: lol, twitter has errors
[16:58:23] <doug65536> dannydagger: guess they should hang around in irc more :P
[16:58:40] <dannydagger> huh? :)
[16:58:53] <doug65536> I checked the twitter link - errors in their stuff
[16:58:59] <dannydagger> oh hehe
[17:00:00] <dannydagger> can i ask you for two last things? then I wont bug you anymore tonight.. first is.. can I have the menu-links background color be active when I scroll through the sections?
[17:00:05] <doug65536> dannydagger: yep looks good
[17:00:15] <dannydagger> like, when I am on section portfolio, the background color should be the same as on hover
[17:00:19] <dannydagger> for the menu links
[17:00:21] <doug65536> 1 sec
[17:00:25] <dannydagger> sure
[17:01:17] <doug65536> back
[17:01:33] <dannydagger> :)
[17:01:51] <doug65536> dannydagger: highlight where you are?
[17:02:05] <dannydagger> yeah
[17:02:22] <dannydagger> just like when hovering them
[17:02:37] <doug65536> dannydagger: yeah, let me see
[17:05:13] <dannydagger> alrighty
[17:06:21] <cameron262> this doesnt seem to work for me:
[17:06:22] <cameron262> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/nested-list-header-themes-data-position-fixed-list-data-themes-how
[17:06:25] <cameron262> does anyone know why?
[17:17:41] <dannydagger> doug65536: I believe waypoints.js is an easy way? or maybe there is a better-performance option? http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/
[17:18:55] <doug65536> dannydagger: I almost have it done
[17:18:59] <dannydagger> awesome :)
[17:27:36] <doug65536> dannydagger: this should do it https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148512
[17:27:46] <doug65536> dannydagger: I can't debug it though, you'll have to try it
[17:28:18] <doug65536> requires a css class named positionhighlight which has the styling you want on the menu item
[17:28:30] <dannydagger> sec
[17:28:36] <howieFelterbush> Good Evening all. I have a horizontal menu bar (<li>) that needs to be able to show left and right arrows if more options exist than I have space for. How do I google that?
[17:29:01] <doug65536> oops
[17:29:14] <Fraz> lol
[17:29:16] <doug65536> dannydagger: https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148512
[17:29:16] <Fraz> classic
[17:29:24] <Fraz> "how do i google that"
[17:29:52] <howieFelterbush> Well, I wouldn't want you to think that i didn't at least try to find it before relying on your gracious help.
[17:30:18] <Fraz> yeah i respect you for it lol
[17:30:29] <Fraz> i cant help
[17:30:34] <Fraz> but thought it was funny
[17:30:50] <doug65536> dannydagger: crap another bug. 1 sec
[17:31:05] <dannydagger> doug65536: i can remove (function() { if i put it at the bottom of my main.js right?
[17:31:05] <howieFelterbush> me too. After about an hour of missing the mark constantly, I figured someone here would be able to help if not point me in the right direction.
[17:31:42] <doug65536> dannydagger: why would you want to remove that? it prevents polluting global scope with variables
[17:31:57] <doug65536> yes in ready handler you can remove it I guess
[17:32:09] <Fraz> but you pre-defended yourself against the people that were gonna say "google it"
[17:32:09] <doug65536> it limits variable scope so other code wont smash my data
[17:32:37] <dannydagger> doug65536: if i dont remove it, i need to put it outside of the ready handler right?
[17:32:45] <doug65536> dannydagger: no
[17:32:46] <howieFelterbush> I figure I can handle the screen resize event and cycle through the menu to determine if the sum of the widths of the elements is greater than the available space before revealing the arrows. But surely there's a better way.
[17:32:47] <dannydagger> ah ok
[17:32:50] <dannydagger> testing now
[17:32:51] <dannydagger> sec
[17:33:06] <doug65536> dannydagger: did you get latest version at https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148512
[17:33:27] <doug65536> dannydagger: crap found another bug lol
[17:33:49] <dannydagger> yeah i did
[17:33:56] <dannydagger> what? :)
[17:34:02] <howieFelterbush> perhaps, if the menubar is getting squeezed, I can just replace it with a drop down.
[17:34:44] <doug65536> dannydagger: https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148512
[17:35:43] <dannydagger> doesnt seem to work
[17:35:43] <doug65536> dannydagger: you'd have to update site for me to step through it...
[17:35:46] <dannydagger> i will
[17:35:47] <dannydagger> sec
[17:36:19] <doug65536> dannydagger: this goes drastically beyond what I would do for random irc guy but I like you :)
[17:36:24] <dannydagger> ok done
[17:36:26] <dannydagger> check it out
[17:37:00] <dannydagger> doug65536: haha yeah I was just wondering how you could bear with me so many hours.. it is truly appreciated believe me
[17:37:13] <dannydagger> wondering=thinking*
[17:38:10] <doug65536> dannydagger: bugfixes https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148512
[17:38:47] <dannydagger> uploaded
[17:39:15] <dannydagger> still not working.. i might have to add something else to my css than .positionhighlight {background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);}
[17:39:15] <howieFelterbush> what are you trying to accomplish? You just want to highlight the current secction on a vertical section scroller?
[17:39:36] <dannydagger> howieFelterbush: yeah
[17:40:04] <howieFelterbush> Do you have each section set with an explicit height that === the viewport height?
[17:40:59] <dannydagger> no
[17:41:18] <howieFelterbush> Put your sections in a slider div inside a "viewport" div. the viewport div set overflow:hidden; and reposition the css top of the slider to some whole number multiple of section number
[17:41:48] <howieFelterbush> * viewport height
[17:42:17] <howieFelterbush> to determine the current section, divide the relative offset of the slider dive by the viewport  height and you got it.
[17:42:26] <nesoi> in javascript, if I want to see if a property exists and has a value, what's the best way? can I just do if(object.property) or do I have to do something like if(object.property !== null) or if (typeof object.property !=="undefined") ?
[17:42:31] <doug65536> howieFelterbush: he can't make the sections equal sized
[17:42:42] <dannydagger> ^ what he said
[17:43:33] <howieFelterbush> Then, i f you just want the top section displayed, cycle through the sections totalling their heights and divide the offset until you get 0.
[17:44:21] <doug65536> dannydagger: bugfix https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148512
[17:45:00] <dannydagger> uploaded
[17:45:37] <dannydagger> maybe waypoints.js is much easier and less time-consuming bro?
[17:46:05] <dannydagger> only con with that solution is an extra http request i guess
[17:46:27] <nesoi> anyone have a hint about that?
[17:47:05] <doug65536> dannydagger: bugfix https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148512
[17:47:09] <doug65536> dannydagger: it's almost there
[17:47:13] <dannydagger> hehe ok
[17:47:38] <dannydagger> uploaded
[17:48:13] <nesoi> no one? in javascript, if I want to see if a property exists and has a value, what's the best way? can I just do if(object.property) or do I have to do something like if(object.property !== null) or if (typeof object.property !=="undefined") ?
[17:48:40] <doug65536> nesoi: if (foo.someproperty === undefined)
[17:48:58] <nesoi> really? I thought you had to do typeof and 'undefined'?
[17:49:31] <doug65536> >> var a = { foo: 5 }; a.bar === undefined
[17:49:40] <doug65536> >> var a = { foo: 5 }; a.bar === undefined;
[17:49:49] <doug65536> where's ecmabot
[17:49:55] <doug65536> or nevermind, that's javascript channel
[17:50:35] <doug65536> nesoi: trust me
[17:52:02] <nesoi> what about just if(object.property)
[17:52:06] <nesoi> that won't work?
[17:52:12] <nesoi> or if (!object.property)
[17:52:27] <nesoi> I want see if it exists and is not null
[17:52:50] <nesoi> doug65536â€¦
[17:53:25] <doug65536> nesoi: it won't work if the property is 0 or false or "false"
[17:53:39] <doug65536> trust me, === undefined is what you want
[17:53:46] <nesoi> if it's 0 or false or "false" then I consider it bad
[17:53:57] <doug65536> dannydagger: bugfix https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148512
[17:53:58] <nesoi> it has to have some actual value for me to say it exists
[17:54:12] <doug65536> nesoi: that's not the question you asked
[17:54:19] <nesoi> I want to know that object.property exists and is not null
[17:54:21] <nesoi> or false
[17:54:24] <nesoi> or 0
[17:54:37] <dannydagger> doug65536: uploaded
[17:54:53] <nesoi> so is if (object.property) right then or will it get me into trouble if object.property is undefined?
[17:55:14] <doug65536> nesoi: it will work if you want 0, false, "false" to be false
[17:55:20] <doug65536> undefined will be ok
[17:55:42] <doug65536> undefined == false
[17:55:51] <doug65536> but not === false :_
[17:57:35] <doug65536> nesoi: var a = {}; if (!a.foo) { console.log("!");}   <-- prints !
[17:59:03] <doug65536> dannydagger: REALLY close now... probably last bug
[17:59:33] <doug65536> dannydagger: https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148512
[17:59:47] <dannydagger> hehe lets see :)
[18:00:14] <dannydagger> ahhhh almost
[18:00:16] <dannydagger> uploading
[18:03:07] <doug65536> dannydagger: found another bug https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148512
[18:03:10] <doug65536> lol
[18:03:31] <doug65536> you get to do the tedious part :)
[18:04:33] <dannydagger> haha :)
[18:04:34] <dannydagger> gonna try
[18:04:48] <dannydagger> uploaded
[18:04:56] <dannydagger> damn
[18:04:57] <dannydagger> works now
[18:05:18] <dannydagger> it should release the class when on #hem though (the initial page)
[18:06:34] <dannydagger> and when you hover an active class now.. it gets even another class.. but maybe thats just some finework to do in the css
[18:08:17] <dannydagger> and when you click on the portfolio button.. it highlights the "kontakta oss" button
[18:08:44] <doug65536> dannydagger: hmm, yes it is off a bit...
[18:08:56] <dannydagger> doug65536: is there no way connecting it to the active seciton id's?
[18:09:08] <doug65536> dannydagger: it is
[18:09:13] <dannydagger> oh ok
[18:09:27] <doug65536> does my code make sense?
[18:09:53] <doug65536> I build a lookup table of where each section starts, then on scroll I find which one you're at and highlight that items menu item with the class....
[18:09:59] <dannydagger> not at all to me.. as I said earlier I only know css and html :)
[18:10:06] <dannydagger> ah ok
[18:10:09] <doug65536> but it should take the window height into account
[18:10:39] <doug65536> right now it highlights a section when you are *past* that section anchor
[18:11:20] <dannydagger> I see
[18:11:20] <doug65536> dannydagger: aha... I see
[18:11:23] <dannydagger> it releases the class when you scroll all the way down to the footer though.. if that could be inverted to the top somehow
[18:11:33] <doug65536> dannydagger: the page changes after I build the table...
[18:12:43] <doug65536> dannydagger: I'm trying to make the scroll handler super fast, because that event happens a lot and I don't want stutter
[18:13:00] <dannydagger> ah
[18:13:21] <doug65536> ok, what I can do is periodically refresh the lookup table...
[18:13:29] <doug65536> that should fix it being off...
[18:13:36] <dannydagger> sure lets try
[18:18:36] <nsanden> so i have a div with a checkbox inside it and some jquery that checks the checkbox when i click anywhere inside the div. problem is, if i click the checkbox, it appears nothing happens (box wont ever get checked).
[18:18:41] <nsanden> i assume it is checking it, and then unchecking it at the same time
[18:18:44] <nsanden> anyone have any tips for fixing that
[18:20:25] <kborchers> nsanden: in your click handler, make sure the target of the click event isn't the checkbox before checking it
[18:20:35] <doug65536> dannydagger: https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148512
[18:21:03] <kborchers> nsanden: or make sure the target is the div â€¦ either way
[18:21:39] <nsanden> kborchers: yeah i figured something like that but not sure what to use. $('.div').not('.checkbox').on('click...
[18:21:52] <nsanden> didnt do anything
[18:21:52] <dannydagger> doug65536: looks great all the way down to "kontakt" and then it releases the class.. and on the top it still contains the class
[18:21:56] <dannydagger> doug65536: uploaded it
[18:22:47] <kborchers> nsanden: you need to check the event.target inside the event handler where you check the checkbox, not in your selector
[18:23:11] <dannydagger> doug65536: another thing is.. when you hover over an active .positionhighlight class.. it adds the li:hover over it.. I can fix that by removing the opacity from the background colors.. but the li a is white in li:hover, and it is not white in .positionhighlight.. any way we can fix that?
[18:24:25] <dannydagger> uploaded the css fix too
[18:24:50] <dannydagger> doug65536: my bad, I will just put color:white in .positionhighlight.. getting tired lol
[18:25:18] <doug65536> doug65536: and if necessary put !important after the value to ensure it overrides
[18:26:04] <nsanden> kborchers: i will try that, thank you
[18:26:07] <doug65536> dannydagger: it's 3 am there? Im in canada
[18:26:32] <dannydagger> yeah its 3 am :) sweden
[18:27:42] <doug65536> dannydagger: I guess I need to offset the scroll position by the navbar height
[18:27:52] <dannydagger> uploaded it now.. looks great, just two more bugs.. that one with the top not releasing the class.. and when you click the big blue button on the initial page.. it doesn't change the highlight to "tjanster"
[18:28:35] <dannydagger> doug65536: cool.. and the "kontakta oss" button kicks in at the middle of portfolio div
[18:29:03] <nsanden> kborchers: worked like a charm and fixed other elements inside the div as well
[18:32:03] <doug65536> dannydagger: adding half the window height to the scroll position will probably give it more intuitive mechanic
[18:33:58] <dannydagger> now that's some advanced english right there for a swede lol.. but yeah i guess so :)
[18:34:33] <doug65536> intuitive = feels natural and obvious
[18:34:57] <dannydagger> doug65536: is there no easier way of just binding the highlight to every section id, and releasing on #hem.. and activating on every sectioin change.. like #hem #omoss #tjanster etc...
[18:35:01] <dannydagger> ah ok ok :)
[18:35:23] <dannydagger> instead of height offsets
[18:35:53] <doug65536> how do I know when a "section" change happens without knowing the offsets
[18:36:13] <doug65536> "section change"*
[18:36:18] <dannydagger> when another section is active? or jquery doesn't work that way?
[18:36:27] <doug65536> no
[18:36:28] <dannydagger> when the next section is active*
[18:36:31] <dannydagger> ah ok
[18:36:58] <doug65536> in the computer's mind, the whole page exists at once. what you see only affects drawing
[18:37:16] <dannydagger> my bad hehe.. I would never torture you with this task if i knew it was this complicated sry
[18:38:23] <doug65536> dannydagger: try this https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148512
[18:39:47] <dannydagger> damn brackets editor
[18:39:49] <dannydagger> crashed my computer
[18:40:29] <doug65536> dannydagger: try https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148512
[18:40:43] <doug65536> dannydagger: that one is relative to the middle of the window
[18:40:44] <dannydagger> 1 sec
[18:40:49] <doug65536> should make more sense
[18:40:52] <dannydagger> cool
[18:40:52] <doug65536> sure, making a coffee...
[18:40:57] <dannydagger> nice
[18:40:59] <dannydagger> what time is it there?
[18:41:11] <doug65536> 9:41pm
[18:41:41] <dannydagger> gahh everytime someone mentions coffee i want to make some lol
[18:42:38] <dannydagger> uploaded the change
[18:46:15] <doug65536> dannydagger: hmmm...
[18:47:29] <doug65536> dannydagger: oops, this will work https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148512
[18:47:45] <howieFelterbush> dannydagger, http://jsbin.com/inorun/1/
[18:47:47] <doug65536> 50% of window might be too much...
[18:48:50] <dannydagger> ahh
[18:48:50] <dannydagger> doug65536
[18:49:13] <dannydagger> the highlight is starting on the #hem (initial page) div
[18:49:22] <dannydagger> it should start on #omoss the one after the initial page
[18:49:24] <dannydagger> uploading
[18:49:49] <dannydagger> if it started on #omoss they would all time perfectly
[18:51:49] <dannydagger> howieFelterbush: I think I gotta re-arrange my whole site for that to work mate :/
[18:52:43] <howieFelterbush> Hmm... I'd have to see your site (or how it's setup at least).
[18:53:16] <dannydagger> www.colorworld.se/testing123
[18:53:21] <howieFelterbush> when using the window.scroll method, are you "snapping" to the topmost section?
[18:53:44] <doug65536> it animates
[18:55:45] <doug65536> dannydagger: this uses jquery to get scroll position, might work better, also based on 25% down in window https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148512
[18:56:27] <dannydagger> uploaded
[18:56:43] <dannydagger> looks the same i think
[18:57:06] <dannydagger> also when I click a menu link, it highlights the next link
[18:57:10] <doug65536> dannydagger: first blue button works right?
[18:57:21] <dannydagger> ah yes
[18:57:58] <doug65536> dannydagger: yes it's not the right scale or something
[18:58:13] <doug65536> what I get for scroll position doesn't seem to match the page coordinates scale
[18:58:40] <dannydagger> hmm strange.. something wrong in the html or something?
[18:59:07] <doug65536> you have a -82 hack in your animate
[18:59:09] <doug65536> why is that?
[18:59:18] <howieFelterbush> I dread working with scrolling windows. I much prefer to simulate my own scroller. Site looks great, though
[18:59:23] <dannydagger> doug65536 what is that?
[18:59:33] <doug65536> line 53
[19:00:14] <dannydagger> doug65536: no clue bro.. should i remove the -82?
[19:00:17] <doug65536> no
[19:00:28] <dannydagger> it has something to do with the smooth scrolling.. not sure what
[19:00:30] <doug65536> that is probably the height of the navbar thing at the top
[19:00:56] <dannydagger> ah ok
[19:03:10] <doug65536> oh, I think my adjustment goes the wrong way!
[19:03:31] <dannydagger> hehe ok
[19:03:31] <doug65536> https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148512
[19:03:39] <dannydagger> lets try
[19:04:10] <dannydagger> uploaded
[19:06:04] <doug65536> it's off by 1
[19:06:13] <dannydagger> ah
[19:07:00] <doug65536> https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148512
[19:08:04] <dannydagger> looks much better
[19:08:17] <dannydagger> a little bit buggy still though.. minor bugs i think
[19:08:50] <doug65536> that 0.25 can be tweaked (or made 0.0)... not sure
[19:09:02] <dannydagger> trying 0
[19:09:05] <dannydagger> 0.0
[19:09:50] <dannydagger> 0.0 worked pretty good
[19:09:52] <dannydagger> uploading
[19:10:01] <dannydagger> still not releasing on #hem though
[19:10:11] <doug65536> what's #hem
[19:10:20] <dannydagger> the initial page
[19:10:24] <dannydagger> top
[19:10:36] <doug65536> oh, right I keep forgetting...
[19:10:38] <dannydagger> thats the only bug left, and that it doesn't select the right class no click
[19:10:42] <dannydagger> on click*
[19:12:31] <doug65536> https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148512
[19:12:42] <doug65536> I have a feeling that's it
[19:13:36] <doug65536> or it's super close to right
[19:13:40] <dannydagger> hehe
[19:13:54] <dannydagger> you sure have patiente
[19:13:57] <dannydagger> patience*
[19:14:15] <dannydagger> uploaded it
[19:14:23] <dannydagger> same still
[19:14:49] <dannydagger> or
[19:15:13] <dannydagger> now the changes work better i think, but still those 2 bugs left
[19:15:18] <doug65536> change the +82 to -82
[19:15:34] <dannydagger> it is -82 now
[19:15:41] <dannydagger> oh
[19:15:42] <dannydagger> sry
[19:16:14] <dannydagger> you mean line 88 right? that didnt work good at all
[19:16:24] <dannydagger> uploaded the change
[19:17:08] <doug65536> yes, -160 should do it :)
[19:17:27] <doug65536> or I could query for the height of the navbar at runtime...
[19:17:56] <doug65536> weirdness in the calculation is, the scroll position is relative to whole page - the stuff behind navbar
[19:18:02] <dannydagger> -160 uploaded.. + 82 still gives the most intuitive feel
[19:18:37] <HardDisk_WP> Hi!
[19:18:39] <doug65536> did I say - I meant 160
[19:18:51] <dannydagger> + 160?
[19:18:54] <doug65536> yes
[19:18:59] <dannydagger> testing
[19:19:00] <HardDisk_WP> How do I control the event-parameter with trigger()?
[19:19:06] <dannydagger> uploaded
[19:19:12] <HardDisk_WP> I want to simulate a keypress of keyCode=32,metaKey:false
[19:19:37] <HardDisk_WP> but the extra-parameters of trigger() only allows for *additional* params, not tweaking the event itself
[19:19:37] <doug65536> dannydagger: looks right here
[19:19:43] <dannydagger> yeah it does
[19:20:14] <dannydagger> last bug left releasing the class on #hem lol
[19:20:22] <dannydagger> damn man I can't thank you enough for this
[19:20:23] <doug65536> what's #hem again?
[19:20:30] <dannydagger> hehe initial page
[19:20:39] <dannydagger> hem = home in swedish
[19:21:02] <doug65536> ah, so highlight nothing when user is at top
[19:21:06] <dannydagger> yeah
[19:22:06] <doug65536> https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148512
[19:22:55] <doug65536> oops, didn't include 160 adjustment
[19:23:22] <glen1> hey
[19:23:50] <dannydagger> absolutely fenomenal
[19:23:54] <dannydagger> uploading
[19:24:48] <dannydagger> doug65536: you're the biggest hero alive! :)
[19:24:57] <doug65536> lol
[19:47:18] <sammich> are you calling him fat?
[19:47:38] <tw2113> calling me fat?????
[19:47:47] <tw2113> truth hurts *cries*
[20:32:55] <Dreamer3> what is better than $("#new_task_form")[0]
[20:33:02] <Dreamer3> i.e., how can i test if an element was fount
[20:33:52] <tw2113> ?length
[20:34:04] <tw2113> maybe? possibly? don't fail me now bot
[20:34:33] <Dreamer3> i feel like i need to define an exists
[20:35:17] <tw2113> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length
[20:35:34] <tw2113> perhaps? maybe? i've had whiskey tonight
[21:04:49] <ner0x> Anyone use jQuery FileUpoader and know what to bind so that once all files have been processed: call this_function() ?
[21:08:24] <howieFelterbush> Dreamer3 just use: "if (el && el.length) { doStuff();}"
[22:43:54] <ProLoser> i have a question
[22:44:15] <ProLoser> well more like lookign for feedback
[22:44:31] <ProLoser> i'm working on a sort of menu plugin
[22:44:39] <ProLoser> that you can programmatically populate
[22:44:55] <ProLoser> i'm trying to come up with the most 'elegant' way to give the user control over styling, customization and population
[22:45:06] <ProLoser> one thing is that it will need to be able to do nested menus
[22:45:36] <ProLoser> the old version pretty much has a 'title' property and 'iconCssClass' property and a bunch of other stuff, but i feel like that's too strict
[22:46:05] <ProLoser> any suggestions or ideas or thoughts on a nifty or clean way to give users control to messign or customizing the generated DOM easily?
[22:46:22] <ravenzz> templates?
[22:46:56] <ravenzz> you could have a default template and allow the user to specify a template
[22:46:57] <ProLoser> i spose
[22:47:22] <ravenzz> if they want custom html
[22:47:47] <ravenzz> but is that a menu? I mean an UL?
[22:47:55] <ravenzz> a bunch of links
[22:48:00] <ProLoser> yeah...
[22:48:02] <ProLoser> some have icons
[22:48:06] <ProLoser> there are also headings
[22:48:07] <ProLoser> etc
[22:48:26] <ravenzz> but why would you generate a menu with JS?
[22:48:37] <ProLoser> http://mleibman.github.io/SlickGrid/examples/example-plugin-headermenu.html
[22:48:48] <ProLoser> i'm rewriting that cuz it's so constricting
[22:50:46] <gWong> hey, newb jq mobile question -- how do you use trigger.('create) to reload css after ajax navigation?
[22:50:58] <gWong> thought just adding  .$('jqmData(role='page')").trigger('pagecreate'); <-- this single line in a script would work
[23:15:18] <dylan9o4_> hey guys, have you ever had an element that when you tell to slidedown, it just displays the element with no animation? this is in chrome, slidedown usually works, but what makes the animation "skip-out"?
[23:16:28] <dylan9o4_> this is used with the "slow" duration, and after almost a second then the element is just displayed
[23:17:28] <dylan9o4_> anybody on?
[23:20:12] <jennifer_> i see animations fail sometimes if I have applied a CSS transition to an element and then add a jquery statement
[23:20:27] <jennifer_> they seem to cancel each other out
[23:21:11] <paulvd> hello, i have a code like <a href="full-image.jpg"><img src="image-thumb.jpg" /></a> is there a way to load all the linked images with the page loading ?
[23:21:52] <jennifer_> also if you have a transition delay set in the CSS
[23:49:28] <trollboy> http://hyborianlabs.net/  so I've a jquery plugin I wrote that is change from float:left to float;right... is there a way to get them to preserve order?
[23:51:07] <trollboy> never mind, got it
