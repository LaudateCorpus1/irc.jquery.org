[10:11:31] <jquery610> can anyone recommend a good book for learning Jquery Ajax ?
[10:14:09] <jquery610> I tried the documentation from w3 and jquery, but i want a book based on someone experience
[10:24:34] <engaged> Can anyone tell me why my iframe is being loaded twice; on other sites with similar iframe it just loads it once the google analytics (ga) tag is loaded and not initially - don’t know why mine is different: https://www.maidcomplete.com/book-now.php
[10:39:49] <ZoderUck>  hello some of you did try to  attach/connect  a Audio context buffer to an  html audio element? the goal is to see the current timne position playing and the slider moving.
[11:32:12] <MarkTheMark> does anyone know how i can create a magnifying effect for the currently highlighted (or focused) items? kinnd of like this one except that it doesn’t really get magnified. http://soulwire.github.io/FoldScroll/
[11:36:21] <WhirledPress> MarkTheMark, if you are asking how to add to that exact script, it's tricky because although you could add the magnify effect, you would have to recalculate all of the 3d transforms.
[11:36:40] <MarkTheMark> hmm
[11:36:46] <MarkTheMark> yeah it doesn’t quite ring a bell.
[11:37:09] <MarkTheMark> i am just looking for ways to make the center of the postlist more stand out
[11:37:22] <WhirledPress> But you could just pick the one in the middle and enlarge it I suppose. The rest should work.
[11:37:24] <MarkTheMark> by giving it sort of like a zoomed in effect
[11:37:56] <MarkTheMark> but how do i givd that magnifying effect as i scroll down?
[11:42:34] <WhirledPress> the problem you are going to run into is that sometimes there are two visible and sometimes there's only 1   if two are visible and you magnify both, it won't be noticeable.
[11:42:51] <MarkTheMark> wait
[11:42:56] <MarkTheMark> i think i found the right one
[11:42:57] <MarkTheMark> http://lab.hakim.se/monocle/
[11:43:08] <MarkTheMark> just need to tweak a bit
[11:43:28] <WhirledPress> so you didn't want the 3d transforms. That makes it a lot easier
[11:43:47] <MarkTheMark> wait
[11:43:53] <MarkTheMark> i think i still want the effect
[11:44:09] <MarkTheMark> so that the top ones are fading out as i scroll through
[11:44:14] <MarkTheMark> and bottom ones fade in.
[11:44:30] <MarkTheMark> with rotating 3d effect and everything
[11:44:39] <MarkTheMark> would that be too hard?
[11:45:45] <WhirledPress> For me, most likely yes. LOL but maybe not for some folks here.
[11:50:17] <WhirledPress> I would look up Jquery 3D Carousel and try from there.
[11:53:05] <MarkTheMark> thanks.
[13:35:14] <codecutter> Need the regex to replace string "+0.10 - +0.01%" with "+0.10 (+0.01)%"
[13:36:39] <LeGorille> Hi, I have a data attribute that I update after an ajax call, however when I try to fetch the new value, it still gives me the previous one
[13:38:12] <codecutter> ignore above:  "+0.10 - +0.01%" with "0.10 (0.01)%"
[13:40:04] <LeGorille> any idea  ?
[13:44:44] <shoky> LeGorille it should work fine if you're using .attr().   and if you're using .data() then you need to also read with .data()
[13:47:51] <LeGorille> shoky I can see the change with code inspector, however when I try the get the new value It get the old one
[13:50:28] <shoky> LeGorille then you're doing something wrong. make a jsfiddle
[14:05:21] <codecutter> foo..match('[+-]*(\d{1,}.?\d{1,}) *- *[+-]*(\d{1,}.?\d{1,})(.)'); <-- is give me a an empty string
[14:37:10] <adamsilver> How do I use jQuery event delegation to register event listeners once on document or window? I have the content between <body> and </body> compleyely changed and I am losing the bindings that are delcared like this: $(function () {$('.ui.dropdown').dropdown();... once the content is changed. I guess I am looking for something like this: $(document).on('body', 'load', function () { but I can't figure the syntax
[14:45:24] <shoky> adamsilver: what event? and on what element?
[14:45:45] <graphettion> hey shoky!
[14:45:49] <shoky> btw for .on the event name goes first
[14:45:59] <shoky> heya graphettion, sups
[14:46:05] <graphettion> nm, you?
[14:46:12] <shoky> same
[14:46:19] <graphettion> sweet
[14:46:27] <graphettion> just wanted to say hello :P
[14:46:50] <shoky> ;p you from home now?
[14:51:00] <adamsilver> shoky: I am basically trying to follow the recommendation here (https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks#running-javascript-when-a-page-loads): When possible, avoid using the turbolinks:load event to add event listeners directly to elements on the page body. Instead, consider using event delegation to register event listeners once on document or window.
[14:51:17] <adamsilver> Just not sure how I can say that jQ
[14:53:09] <shoky> adamsilver: not sure what?
[14:54:09] <adamsilver> shoky: I need to have some code re-executed whenever the content of the body tag changes
[14:54:41] <shoky> why not use that turbolinks:load event, then? if you're using that lib..
[14:55:43] <shoky> you listen for that event directly on document, it gets triggered on page load and subsequent page changes, according to what you linked
[14:56:33] <adamsilver> shoky: It's not recommended in the guide. I would have to place the binding code twice, once on page load and the second on turbolinks:load
[14:56:35] <shoky> and that comment about event delegation is telling you to use event delegation for your own event handlers (not for this turbolinks:load event)
[14:56:41] <adamsilver> turbolinks:load is not fired on first page load
[14:57:00] <shoky> then their docs are lying..?
[14:57:13] <shoky> "the turbolinks:load event, which fires once on the initial page load and again after every Turbolinks visit"
[14:57:57] <adamsilver> Ha, let me recheck
[14:58:03] <shoky> and no you wouldn't have to place your binding code twice anyway, if you're using event delegation
[14:58:36] <adamsilver> Exactly that's why I want to use it
[14:58:44] <shoky> e.g.  $(document).on('click', '.some-element', function() { ... })
[14:58:54] <shoky> you don't need to run that more than once
[14:59:14] <shoky> (and you shouldn't)
[15:00:04] <adamsilver> shoky: their docs are accurate, I have turbolinks:load placed inside $(function () { which prevented it from firing on page load. Now it loads correctly
[15:00:12] <adamsilver> *had
[15:00:23] <shoky> cool
[15:01:00] <adamsilver> Thanks :)
[15:01:36] <shoky> though if you're gonna use event delegation, i think you shouldn't use the turbolinks:load event for adding the handlers
[15:01:41] <shoky> cause that will run more than once
[15:01:57] <shoky> their docs should be more clear on that point i think..
[15:03:25] <adamsilver> shoky: yeah, I am still wondering how I can bind it like they are recommending
[15:03:41] <shoky> once, on page load
[15:03:47] <adamsilver> Now this is working: document.addEventListener("turbolinks:load", function () {
[15:03:48] <adamsilver>     $('.ui.dropdown').dropdown();
[15:03:48] <adamsilver> });
[15:03:56] <shoky> that's not an event handler :)
[15:04:02] <shoky> .dropdown()  i mean
[15:04:12] <shoky> not something you can simply delegate..
[15:04:26] <shoky> so that kind of stuff SHOULD be inside the turbolinks:load  handler indeed
[15:04:46] <adamsilver> I think I get it now :)
[15:04:57] <shoky> :)
[15:43:13] <LeGorille> var function1 = function() { function2().done(function3()) }
[15:43:28] <LeGorille> I keep getting function2 is undefined
[15:44:18] <LeGorille> any idea ?
[15:45:49] <LeGorille> but only when I use done()
[15:46:12] <LeGorille> if I do function2(); function3(); It works
[15:46:28] <LeGorille> but I need to wait till function2() has finished running
[15:48:55] <systemfault> LeGorille: There's no way in the world anyone could help you with that kind of vague question
[15:49:10] <systemfault> Write a testcase on jsfiddle, give us back a link, we'll try to help.
[15:50:40] <LeGorille> ok systemfault
[15:59:01] <LeGorille> systemfault
[15:59:03] <LeGorille> https://jsfiddle.net/37ayakwv/1/
[16:00:05] <systemfault> LeGorille: .done wants a function as parameter, not the result of that function called.
[16:00:38] <thepr_> I want to find an element containing a string. I'm aware of ":contains()" but that also gives me its parent elements
[16:00:43] <thepr_> I only want the element itself
[16:00:53] <thepr_> is that possible?
[16:01:14] <systemfault> LeGorille: function2().done(function3()); is like doing: var result = function3(); function2().done(result);, as you can see, function3 is executed without waiting for anything.
[16:04:26] <LeGorille> so should I reverse the order ?
[16:04:32] <shoky> also you need to return a promise from function2, not just execute something.   e.g. you need:   return $.ajax(...);
[16:05:15] <shoky> and .done(function3) probably
[16:06:04] <LeGorille> that's what I am doing actually
[16:07:31] <LeGorille> function2() get data via ajax and update data attributes, but function3() needs to wait for function2() to finish before it fires
[16:07:52] <shoky> https://jsfiddle.net/37ayakwv/2/
[16:13:26] <LeGorille> nop it still fires before the end of function2
[16:14:56] <shoky> no it doesn't
[16:38:20] <Velveeta> shoke: "no it doesn't" -- lol, love the matter of factness :D
[16:38:31] <Velveeta> shoky* even
[16:40:54] <LeGorille> but the fact is that it does
[16:40:58] <LeGorille> I am seing it live
[16:42:18] <Velveeta> then your code doesn't look like that jsfiddle, because the way that fiddle is written, function3 would execute after function2's completion
[16:43:02] <LeGorille> function2 is not supposed to return anything
[16:43:23] <LeGorille> it does ajax calls and updates data attributes
[16:44:08] <Velveeta> right, and given that ajax calls are asynchronous chunks of code, that means that any following functions would execute immediately and not wait for the request to complete.... that's why you have to return the promise from the ajax request, so that following code can chain off of that promise and execute when the promise is resolved
[16:44:39] <Velveeta> so if you don't return $.ajax, the other code will have no idea when that request completes
[16:45:53] <LeGorille> I did, but function2 does multiple requests (each) , so that promise is returned after first request is complete or what ??
[16:46:09] <LeGorille> because I need it to completely finish
[16:46:17] <Velveeta> if function2 does multiple requests, there's a way to handle that condition also, i'll demonstrate
[16:46:27] <Velveeta> so you need all requests to finish first right? and then function 3 to execute
[16:48:01] <LeGorille> exactly
[16:48:22] <Velveeta> no problemo, 1 sec
[16:48:59] <LeGorille> thanks, you are saving me here
[16:49:33] <Velveeta> https://jsfiddle.net/37ayakwv/3/
[16:49:56] <Velveeta> $.when allows you to combine a list of promises into 1 master promise, which is resolved when all of the individual ones are resolved, or else rejected whenever the first of any of them is rejected
[16:53:38] <LeGorille> hmmm
[16:54:40] <Velveeta> question(s)?
[16:55:40] <LeGorille> I don't know where to start :)
[16:56:21] <Velveeta> well, if you could paste what your code looks like somewhere, it'd probably help in telling you where to start
[16:57:11] <LeGorille> ok Velveeta, I will write a proper fiddle so you can have a more accurate idea
[16:57:24] <Velveeta> thanks
[16:57:30] <LeGorille> no thank you
[17:13:59] <ChrisBinge> has anyone here ever used js to take the value of an input and update the names of the input with the value?
[17:15:20] <Velveeta> like, change the name attribute on the input to whatever the value was that was entered in the input?
[17:16:54] <ChrisBinge> yeah
[17:17:31] <Velveeta> never done anything like that... can't see what the point would be really, but it should be entirely possible..
[17:18:16] <ChrisBinge> Velveeta, i.e. name="array[section][items]" and section would be updated to whatever the user inputs as the value of the "section name" input
[17:19:15] <Velveeta> yeah, i guess that's one way you could do it.. not how i would, but like i said, yes, you should be able to do that.. you could just use a blur event so that when that field was exited, you would iterate over the form elements and change their names
[17:19:53] <LeGorille> Velveeta https://jsfiddle.net/37ayakwv/4/
[17:21:05] <ChrisBinge> Velveeta, out of curiousity how would you do it?
[17:21:24] <ChrisBinge> Velveeta, the idea comes from this situation - I have a form that I dynamically add sections to and each section has items. I need to save the data in such a way that the sections are keys to their children items
[17:22:36] <Velveeta> chrisbinge: i would just have 'array[section][items]' be something like 'array[0][items]' 'array[1][items]' etc, and have the section name field just be 'array[1][section_name]' and handle that when it's posted to the server
[17:22:46] <Velveeta> legorille: looking now
[17:23:13] <LeGorille> thank you
[17:23:29] <ChrisBinge> so just have an incrimental counter for the first array?
[17:24:46] <Velveeta> legorille: something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/37ayakwv/5/ -- look at lines 2, 35, and 45 for the changes
[17:24:54] <Velveeta> chrisbinge: i would, yeah
[17:25:21] <LeGorille> ok Velveeta
[17:25:39] <ChrisBinge> yeah I guess that is easier.. the data doesn't have to look good on the backend.. I don't know why I always come up with complicated solutions to simple issues
[17:25:43] <Velveeta> no guarantee that'll work because i'm not intimately familiar w/ the code, but from what i read, i think that should do what you're looking for
[17:26:19] <Velveeta> chrisbinge: people accuse me of the same thing all the time... the hardest part of programming isn't making something work, it's making something work *and* be easy to revisit for maintenance ;)
[17:26:51] <ChrisBinge> Velveeta, haha for sure
[18:12:30] <LeGorille> sorry for the delay Velveeta, still the doing the same thing
[18:12:56] <Velveeta> can you post the code in its current state in a new fiddle?
[18:14:03] <LeGorille> it's exactly like your fiddle
[18:14:18] <LeGorille> I just made the changes in lines 2, 35 and 45
[18:19:24] <Velveeta> whoops, i missed one thing
[18:19:34] <Velveeta> on line 50, you should return $.ajax
[18:20:18] <LeGorille> 50 or 70 ?
[18:20:49] <Velveeta> in the fiddle i'm looking at, $.ajax is called on line 50
[18:20:59] <Velveeta> you need change "$.ajax" to "return $.ajax"
[18:25:12] <LeGorille> niiiiiiice :)
[18:25:19] <LeGorille> Velveeta you are a star
[18:25:43] <LeGorille> I cannot thank you enough
[18:26:14] <Velveeta> woo hoo! no problemo :)
[20:11:59] <nathaneltitane> i am hosting my website using dropbox. i set up my dns to mask the DB public url to redirect using a custom domain name. it all works except that i've lost my website's responsiveness because it'S being loaded in a frameset
[20:12:29] <nathaneltitane> is there any way to get rid of the frameset by destroying it on load and reloading hte site entirely
[20:12:54] <nathaneltitane> or could i mask the url in the address bar to avoid using DNS masking
[21:13:17] <mekeor> http://api.jquery.com/ is down from here :( – but i'm sure it will be solved soon. i'm patient, no problem.
[23:43:13] <WhirledPress> If I want to have a panel that opens from the bottom of the screen and closes if the click event happens outside of it, I would attach an event handler to document? But then how do I turn that event handler off once the event happens?
