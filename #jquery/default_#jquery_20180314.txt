[04:32:02] <nindustries> Hi, so I have a li with .on('click'), but .attr('disabled', 'disabled'); still allows me to click
[04:32:33] <Cork> nindustries: 1. don't use .attr to control element state, use prop('disabled', true/false)
[04:32:43] <Cork> 2. li doesn't have a disabled state
[04:32:56] <Cork> so you are just adding an attribute with the text "disabled" and nothing will look for it
[04:33:20] <Cork> as a rule of thumb only form elements has disabled, checked, selected
[04:35:04] <nindustries> hm, same for a
[04:35:19] <Cork> same for all elements that aren't a form element
[04:35:32] <Cork> i think with the possible exception of datalist
[04:35:42] <Cork> don't remember
[04:36:32] <Cork> nindustries: what i'm trying to tell you is add a state on the element (ex. a class) and check for it in the click handler
[04:39:08] <nindustries> yeah, I'm not setting a click event when I reach a state
[04:39:37] <Cork> uh, that isn't what i said
[04:39:57] <nindustries> I know.
[04:48:46] <jak2000> hi all anyone alive
[04:48:51] <jak2000> i need display some results of a search: 10 results any advices? dialog modal? or?
[04:49:20] <Cork> jak2000: that question is way WAY to generic
[04:50:28] <jak2000> sample: i have a catalog of names, if the user type: "CO"  i want display CORK,COMBOY,CONTI and so on...
[04:50:32] <jak2000> Cork understand me?
[04:51:27] <jak2000> i think display in a div but if the results was 20. mmmm i think my app display a large div (horrible)
[05:09:52] <Cork> jak2000: i understand that you want to show some form of structured data, but not exactly what you're asking about
[05:13:26] <jak2000> yes i want display it,
[05:13:43] <jak2000> but not decide if a div scrollable or a dialog modal with div scrollable,
[05:13:53] <jak2000> professional work, what you advice me?
[05:35:16] <dimi1947> is it possible to select an element based on NOT having an attribute?
[05:35:37] <AdamPDotty> yes
[05:36:08] <dimi1947> can you give me some more info please
[05:36:30] <dimi1947> what jquery method should I use?
[05:36:30] <AdamPDotty> elements.not('[attributeName]')
[05:36:44] <dimi1947> I see...you read my mind...
[05:37:48] <AdamPDotty> or like .find('tag:not([attribute])')
[05:48:15] <tilerendering> jquery validation plugin: if I want error messages to appear below the fields AND at another place, how do I do it? I can do either, for now, by specifying “errorLabelContainer”, but what is required to make them appear in 2 different places (head of the form AND below fields)
[06:02:08] <jak2000> Cork: https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/
[06:02:10] <jak2000> :)
[06:15:15] <dimi1947> is it possible to serialize only specific portion of a form...somehow
[06:15:22] <dimi1947> ???
[06:22:58] <grek> why moment().isoWeekday(-6).format('DD-dddd'); give 05 last saturday is 10
[07:27:51] <Anticom> Hi. I'm creating a bunch of jq objects in a loop and i'd like to return them as a single jq object. What's the prefered way of doing so? Can i aggregate them in the loop or do i need to store them in an array and create a new jq object from that?
[07:33:12] <Uhkis> Anticom: .add() is probably what you want
[07:36:45] <Anticom> Uhkis: like this? https://jsfiddle.net/6c1Lvrd9/1/#&togetherjs=qr0TKFm11a
[07:47:18] <Anticom> I can't get this working
[07:47:59] <Anticom> it's only giving me the last added element: https://jsfiddle.net/6c1Lvrd9/10/
[07:51:04] <hakerx1> try each
[07:51:26] <hakerx1> or for :)
[07:51:34] <hakerx1> matter of taste ^^
[07:51:34] <Anticom> what? how is each supposed to help me there?
[07:51:50] <Anticom> Cork: are you here?
[07:52:21] <hakerx1> chan is about pointing direction not fixing them :)
[07:52:59] <hakerx1> fixing them for you :)
[07:53:40] <Anticom> i was asking for a best practice not for some fiddling arround
[07:54:15] <Anticom> i prefer finding the solution myself however when talking about the prefered way of doing something i can't figure that out myself
[07:55:17] <hakerx1> function each
[07:55:30] <hakerx1> or search in array :)
[07:55:48] <Anticom> why should i search somewhere? i want to accumulate the jq objs into a single one
[07:55:55] <Anticom> did you even look at my fiddle?
[07:56:16] <hakerx1> yeah
[07:56:22] <hakerx1> and it is odd :0
[07:56:32] <Anticom> what is odd about it?
[07:57:51] <hakerx1> maybe because main reason i don't use cont :)
[07:57:57] <hakerx1> const :)
[07:58:06] <hakerx1> prefer var ;)
[07:58:09] <Anticom> lol that's plain es6
[07:58:18] <Anticom> you can still replace it with var if you like
[07:58:29] <hakerx1> thats is not the fuss
[07:58:34] <Anticom> i just prefer it bc it's more concise and for other reasons i won't go into since it's not #jq related
[07:58:46] <hakerx1> aah now it makes sense :)
[08:03:45] <hakerx1> https://jsfiddle.net/Faks/6c1Lvrd9/16/
[08:03:47] <hakerx1> ^^
[08:04:18] <hakerx1> is this what you wish to do ?
[08:07:14] <hakerx1> i iterated them trough
[08:07:24] <hakerx1> all that left is to filter what you really need :)
[08:24:13] <Anticom> hakerx1: no it's not, read the function name of my original fiddle in conjunction with my problem description
[08:24:32] <Anticom> the fn is called 'hasToReturnASingleJQueryObject' (emphasis on single)
[08:29:02] <hakerx1> it wont return one ^^
[08:29:15] <hakerx1> filtre with if or other way
[08:29:24] <hakerx1> with match
[08:29:39] <Anticom> you're just not understanding what i'm trying to do
[08:29:51] <hakerx1> i understand you wish itera one item on match
[08:30:01] <Anticom> i don't want to append anything to the dom inside the function and my interface *requires* to return a single JQuery object
[08:31:49] <hakerx1> function filter :
[08:32:27] <Anticom> i want all the elements created inside the loop being returned and not filtered
[08:32:54] <hakerx1> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[08:33:12] <hakerx1> no no if you say this
[08:33:16] <hakerx1> then my solution is right
[08:33:22] <hakerx1> it iterates them
[08:33:35] <hakerx1> but i just appented it to dom but can skip that...
[08:33:48] <hakerx1> or you are explaining it wrong way around ^^
[08:33:55] <Anticom> hakerx1: your solution doesn't even have the function left in the fiddle
[08:34:12] <Anticom> my sample was as concise as it can possibly be
[08:34:29] <hakerx1> okay what is purpose of your function
[08:34:44] <hakerx1> what it will do in daily routine and for what.
[08:35:14] <hakerx1> this one fiddle that guy sent me https://jsfiddle.net/Faks/k924feex/
[08:35:26] <hakerx1> it returns on match array with filter...
[08:35:46] <hakerx1> i had very complex code stil have didn't have time to finish yet.
[08:35:58] <hakerx1> but iterated new idea on this.
[08:36:30] <Anticom> Cork: ping
[08:39:23] <hakerx1> i iterated all elements in array
[08:39:28] <hakerx1> out and appended to dom
[08:39:37] <hakerx1> didnd filtred them on matching single item
[08:40:05] <hakerx1> and removed js base to be able refactor code
[08:40:09] <hakerx1> further
[08:40:27] <hakerx1> functions is limitations while jquery gives full freedom to manupulate...
[08:40:41] <hakerx1> but it's mather of choise and taste...
[08:44:20] <Anticom> hakerx1: this is basically what i want but w/o the overhead of having the template https://jsfiddle.net/6c1Lvrd9/30/
[08:45:28] <Anticom> and this doesn't work: https://jsfiddle.net/6c1Lvrd9/33/
[08:47:37] <mrashad1004> hi all, I have a client how has a page "http://xyz.x/page1.html" and has a "div" inside it like this "<div id='d1'></div>" and he wants me to create a script that will be executed any time someone accessed the address "http://xyz.x/page1.html#d1" but not when access the regular address  "http://xyz.x/page1.html", can I do such a script?
[08:49:25] <Anticom> mrashad1004: no need for jquery there. look at Location.hash https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location
[08:49:53] <mrashad1004> Anticom, thank you
[08:50:12] <Anticom> mrashad1004: https://stackoverflow.com/a/298513/966530 as a concrete example
[08:50:18] <Anticom> you're welcome
[10:16:18] <hellyeah> is there any problem for jquery for running on chrome but not in the firefox. Any spesific version?
[10:17:38] <Cork> no
[10:17:50] <Cork> that is the existence of jquery
[10:21:05] <dimi1947> is there a way I can check an input is filled without using resorting to val()
[10:21:25] <dimi1947> without resorting to val()
[10:21:33] <Cork> not really
[10:23:55] <dimi1947> I am using length to count the number of inputs in the DOM....but now I want to specifically count the number of filled inputs in the DOM
[10:24:09] <dimi1947> what can I do?
[10:26:08] <Anticom> Cork: o/
[10:26:25] <Anticom> Is there a more elegant solution to this? https://jsfiddle.net/6c1Lvrd9/38/
[10:27:45] <Anticom> dimi1947: .filter() ?
[10:28:56] <dimi1947> Anticom:there must be more....
[10:29:05] <dimi1947> filter what
[10:29:25] <dimi1947> and again check must be made...
[10:29:50] <dimi1947> filter alone will not suffice
[10:30:41] <Cork> dimi1947: you could do .filter(function() { return this.value != "" })
[10:30:48] <Cork> but ya, its still basically .val()
[10:31:07] <Cork> the value of a form element is state, you can't select it with css that is why you have to
[10:31:46] <Cork> Anticom: what is it you're trying to do?
[10:37:50] <Anticom> Cork: my function is required to only return a single JQuery object. For a certain case i need to fall back to generating a bunch of divs and i'd like to return them as a single jq collection
[10:38:26] <Anticom> Cork: i was trying to have an empty jq object for the accumulator and also tried a raw array but both didn't work
[10:38:48] <Anticom> so basically i just would like to get rid of <template> and .find('div') at the end if possible
[10:50:19] <Cork> Anticom: var a = $(); a = a.add(elm); a = a.add(elm)
[10:50:39] <Cork> Anticom: or var a=[];  a.push(elm); a.push(elm); a.push(elm); return $(a)
[10:50:41] <Cork> should both work
[10:50:55] <Cork> (i've used them both in code i've written over the years)
[10:51:14] <Anticom> hm let me check
[10:51:20] <Cork> as the former creates a new object for every time you add one member i tend to prefer the later
[10:51:32] <Cork> (less gc)
[10:52:42] <Anticom> https://jsfiddle.net/6c1Lvrd9/40/ does not work
[10:53:02] <Anticom> your two proposed solutions where my first idea but couldn't get either to work as expected
[10:53:34] <Cork> Anticom: https://jsfiddle.net/6c1Lvrd9/42/
[10:53:53] <Cork> you did $([$(elm),$(elm),$(elm),$(elm),$(elm),$(elm)])
[10:54:04] <Cork> and ya $() can't handle an array of jquery arrays
[10:54:15] <Anticom> that's stooopid
[10:54:31] <Cork> not really
[10:54:38] <Anticom> why?
[10:54:58] <Anticom> it would be convenient
[10:55:10] <Cork> if you want to merge jquery objects use .add
[10:55:15] <Cork> it is what it is there for
[10:55:23] <Cork> var a = $();
[10:55:34] <Cork> a = a.add($('<div>').text(o));
[10:56:32] <Anticom> but still it would be convenient. IMO jq has a lot of weird ways to use it that serve specific use cases to make the code more compact
[10:56:52] <Anticom> but t.hanks anyway :-)
[10:56:55] <Cork> Anticom: it would have to loop the array and then extract the objects of each member
[10:57:04] <Cork> so it is kinda horrible way of giving it data
[10:58:09] <Uhkis> Anticom: you do know the jquery slogan, right? :P
[10:58:25] <Anticom> Uhkis: ?
[10:58:44] <Uhkis> Anticom: write less, do more
[10:58:48] <Anticom> Cork: but doing const $b = $($a) isn't horrible?
[10:59:28] <Cork> Anticom: if $a is a jquery object it is the equiv of doing (function(j) return j; })($a)
[10:59:37] <Cork> so no it isn't
[10:59:58] <Anticom> hm
[11:12:38] <hakerx1> so kinda i was right :D
[11:38:40] <vancha_> Hey guys, does anyone know why my simple jquery autocomplete code does not work? i have the following code: https://paste.gnome.org/pbftbjyib , that works fine when i use the abbove commented out string as the source. but when i use a php file, absolutely nothing gets output.
[11:40:08] <vancha_> autocomplete.php only echoes a json_encoded php array, that looks like array('aaa','bbbb');
[11:40:18] <vancha_> so two lines of code
[11:40:42] <vancha_> but apparently the jquery script can't get it from the file
[11:47:11] <hakerx1> jsfidle ruels.
[11:47:14] <hakerx1> rules.
[11:49:52] <hakerx1> extract it from var ...
[12:02:40] <Anticom> vancha_: have you looked at the docs for autocomplete? ;)
[12:03:02] <vancha_> yes, the problem was a the correct path ;)
[12:03:06] <vancha_> i knew both files worked
[12:03:24] <Anticom> ah okay
[12:04:10] <Anticom> vancha_: btw it's a good idea to send a content-type:text/jsoin aswell in your php script just for good measure
[12:04:39] <vancha_> as a header?
[12:05:08] <vancha_> The problem is i'm not at all familiar with javascript and jquery, i've only ever used PHP
[12:06:09] <Anticom> vancha_: yes. The things is that jquery sometimes tries to guess the returned format and one of the criteria is the content-type provided by the server
[12:06:54] <Anticom> dunno whether jq's autocomplete is using this magic aswell but it won't hurt ;)
[12:08:14] <vancha_> thanks ;)
[13:55:58] <catbadger> wutup
[13:57:04] <robertmaxrees> good morning
[13:57:30] * hakerx1 Grins
[14:03:44] <catbadger> it is a good morning
[14:04:13] <catbadger> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49077748/androidinterface-is-not-defined-what-gives in case anyone can offer insight...
[14:06:42] <robertmaxrees> are you using pimatic?
[14:07:00] <catbadger> what's that?
[14:07:27] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/pimatic/pimatic/issues/953
[14:07:53] <catbadger> no.. this is a backbone webapp
[14:08:09] <robertmaxrees> so
[14:08:43] <robertmaxrees> given the information you have in that SO post, how are we supposed to help?
[14:09:45] <catbadger> yeah well that's what the js exception tells us
[14:09:52] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[14:09:52] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:10:14] <catbadger> was just curious if anyone else had seen it
[14:10:50] <robertmaxrees> also: why do you think it's jquery related?
[14:16:57] <catbadger> I know it's javascript related
[14:17:08] <robertmaxrees> okie :)
[14:17:28] <catbadger> unsure what's causing it, figured asking a community of other people who deal with browser issues all day might turn up some new info
[14:17:56] <catbadger> because i can't reproduce it at all
[14:23:09] <robertmaxrees> just find it odd that you tagged it with jQuery on SO :) that's all.
[14:29:45] <catbadger> I did because it might have been
[14:29:56] <catbadger> our system uses jquery extensively
[14:29:58] <robertmaxrees> fair enough
[17:25:29] <mark721> hi guys
[17:25:50] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[17:26:08] <mark721> im having some odd behaviour btw i guess this could be considered as a mainly a js question
[17:26:20] <mark721> so firstly im developing a single page app as a project
[17:26:44] <mark721> so its all about dom manipulation lots of jquery etc. and the files are all local and there is no server its being simulated by a js api.
[17:26:58] <mark721> now the problem, in one file i have defined a function within a document.ready
[17:27:20] <mark721> Sometimes, this function refuses to work. i,e i get
[17:27:52] <robertmaxrees> so i'ma stop you there.
[17:27:57] <mark721> go on
[17:28:20] <robertmaxrees> in SPAs, you don't normally rely on doc ready like you normally would.
[17:28:37] <robertmaxrees> so you'll want to modify your logic.
[17:28:39] <mark721> its a university project not commercial.
[17:28:45] <robertmaxrees> that...
[17:28:50] <robertmaxrees> doesn't change anything?
[17:28:59] <mark721> no but as in the code that we were given
[17:29:02] <mark721> was in that structure.
[17:29:09] <robertmaxrees> document ready doesn't (nor should it) fire outside of a normal page reload.
[17:29:15] <robertmaxrees> *load/reload
[17:29:30] <robertmaxrees> SPAs shouldn't rely on doc ready to fire outside of that lifecycle.
[17:29:56] <mark721> I'll be honest and say that im just going with what i was given
[17:30:05] <mark721> i dont know enough js to confidentally explain.
[17:30:10] <mark721> The error that i get is
[17:30:10] <mark721> Uncaught ReferenceError: hideItemPane is not defined
[17:30:27] <robertmaxrees> is hideItemPane the function in the doc ready?
[17:30:40] <mark721> yas
[17:30:53] <robertmaxrees> and I'm guessing you're trying to access it from outside the document ready.
[17:30:57] <mark721> yas
[17:31:00] <robertmaxrees> can't do that.
[17:31:20] <robertmaxrees> you could try to trigger document ready again, but like I said, with SPAs that's a bad idea.
[17:32:17] <mark721> oh so are u saying like since its in a doc ready its no longer a "global"/public func
[17:32:48] <robertmaxrees> you're running into scope in JS.
[17:33:19] <robertmaxrees> any object declared in a function is only available in that scope - ie that function and any functions defined within it.
[17:33:37] <mark721> ty crystal clear now :)
[17:34:27] <robertmaxrees> rad
[17:44:32] <mark721> robertmaxrees, worked a charm ty
[17:44:59] <mark721> the issue is the document.ready was so big e.g several hundred lines of code, i forgot that it was
[17:45:01] <mark721> even there
[17:45:14] <mark721> (since i never went to the top of the document
[17:45:17] <mark721> that often)
[17:45:51] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:46:01] <robertmaxrees> this is why modules are cool :)
[17:47:01] <robertmaxrees> also:
[17:47:22] <robertmaxrees> youre doc ready sounds huge.  you're not stuffing every little thing in there, right?
[17:53:24] <mark721> well tbf i started i was given this project
[17:53:38] <mark721> and they taught me no js or jquery.
[17:53:46] <mark721> and they gave me the file already with 300 lines.
[17:54:11] <grapheti> they shouldn't expect much if they know this lol
[17:54:48] <mark721> the focus is hci and not code and plus i really dont
[17:55:10] <mark721> grapheti, i mean idk why they gave us this project its been really annoying
[17:55:24] <grapheti> talk to a higher up
[17:55:47] <robertmaxrees> it's a school project?
[17:55:54] <mark721> university (uk)
[17:55:55] <mark721> i mean it's too late, i've been grinding for a week and the ik
[17:56:29] <mark721> *idk like i just want it to be over its stupid idk how this shows hci, since like they taught u no coding so ur only as good as ur coding ability
[17:57:37] <grapheti> What degree is this in?
[17:57:44] <mark721> computer science
[17:57:59] <grapheti> There is usually coding in that.
[17:58:00] <grapheti> :P
[17:58:02] <mark721> yeah
[17:58:06] <mark721> but they normally teach u some coding!
[17:58:21] <mark721> or you have covered it previously.
[17:58:28] <mark721> they did neither.
[17:58:28] <grapheti> What level is the class?
[17:58:38] <mark721> final year (3rd)
[17:58:53] <grapheti> They didn't teach you anything in beginning level?
[17:59:06] <mark721> we got told to do try jquery tutorial in january
[17:59:32] <grapheti> That doesn't answer my question.
[17:59:32] <mark721> *early jan, and we got given a mini non graded project to do which lasted less than a week
[17:59:37] <mark721> No
[17:59:41] <mark721> nothing
[17:59:50] <mark721> not one line,
[17:59:51] <grapheti> Get your money back, lol
[18:00:09] <mark721> the thing is its HCI, so like
[18:00:17] <mark721> how is this project 40% functionality.
[18:00:20] <mark721> *graded

[18:13:41] <grapheti> Maybe the college parties were worth it?
[18:13:54] <grapheti> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[18:14:05] <robertmaxrees> it's almost like college is about more than getting a degree
[18:15:47] <mark721> its the first time that i have been in a situation like this tbh
[18:16:18] <robertmaxrees> and it won't be the last :)
[18:16:29] <mark721> nah its the last term :)
[18:16:37] <mark721> so it will :D
[18:16:42] <mark721> well at uni anyway
[18:17:53] <gambl0re> hi robert
[18:21:34] <robertmaxrees> mark721 that's what I mean :) you'll come up against all sorts of crazy stuff at your future jobs.
[18:22:43] <mark721> tbf when its a job idm since i know there isnt much to lose
[18:22:51] <mark721> but i know with a cw there is my grade
[18:22:54] <mark721> at stake
[18:23:41] <mark721> also when u have a job, you focus normally on one thing. that job. at uni u have multiple courses. so atm i have literally just done this course for the whole week non stop
[18:23:44] <mark721> which is not fun.
[18:32:22] <grapheti> Grades are pretty pointless unless they are backed up by something.
[18:33:11] <grapheti> It's about the substance with learning and using that in what you want to do.
[18:33:31] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:33:51] <grapheti> There's a lot of garbage out there. You have to weed it out. :D
