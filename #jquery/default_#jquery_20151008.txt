[00:02:43] <Whiskey> i try to rewrite this "document.getElementById("id").style.minWidth = 0 + "px"" , but i donÂ´t get it to work, i come up whit something like $("#PreTime").style.minWidth = 0 + "px"
[02:11:15] <Cork> Whiskey: $("#PreTime").css('min-width', '0px')
[02:11:26] <Cork> style is a dom property
[02:39:39] <Whiskey> yeh
[02:40:05] <Whiskey> Cork, to get the value i just do $("#PreTime").css('min-width') right
[02:40:08] <Whiskey> to see how many px is it
[02:40:18] <Cork> yes
[02:40:31] <Whiskey> anyway how do i get this to work
[02:40:32] <Whiskey> 'var calc+type = function() {
[02:40:44] <Whiskey> calc is text and type i s a variable
[02:40:56] <Whiskey> try to make it a bit dynamic
[02:44:42] <Whiskey> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/35/
[02:44:49] <Whiskey> is the foreach i try to work
[02:45:35] <Whiskey> insted of duplicate the code
[03:00:43] <robhol> calc+type? wut.
[03:08:56] <xec> Whiskey: if you have an object you can give it dynamically named properties with object["calc" + type] = ... - but you can't do this with normal variables
[03:10:20] <xec> Whiskey: on the other hand, if you create a scope (with an iife for instance, or use $.each() or .forEach() instead of for) you don't need two different names
[03:11:42] <xec> Whiskey: what is this code for btw? it is a bit confusing to me that you're writing to the same element $(".Time") for both Text and Dos though?
[03:41:08] <anli> Is there a plugin that shows chromes viewport width even if I am not resizing the window?
[03:41:17] <anli> In the corner
[04:13:45] <TheBarCall> I have a quick question: In the trigger() documentation (http://api.jquery.com/trigger/) I apparently have misunderstood the first note or I'm having an error in my simple test: http://jsfiddle.net/Lwx78xf7/1/ I'd be happy if someone here could tell me where my error is. For the fiddle, you need to have the console open. Click on the test button, then on Cancel in the confirmation box. It doesn't call preventDefault() so the appr
[04:13:51] <TheBarCall> executed, shouldn't it?
[04:14:39] <TheBarCall> (However (Spoilers!), it isn't executed for me)
[04:51:15] <TheBarCall> This seriously is an indentation issue. I don't know how, but the code randomly switches from spaces to tabs. Maybe I shouldn't test my things in jsfiddle. At least not with indentation-based languages like CoffeeScript. *sigh*
[04:53:46] <Whiskey> Hmm
[04:53:47] <Whiskey> xec :D
[05:18:10] <Whiskey> hmm that was easy to fix
[05:18:16] <Whiskey> thanks xec :D
[05:24:41] <xec> yw :)
[05:27:41] <lalalaaa> Hi! How do I get the full width of this scrollable div? http://jsfiddle.net/p6jh6eLm/ tried width(), outerWidth() and innerWidth() to no avail.
[05:28:04] <sebb> hi guys ! Im using django with jquery. In my script I would like to dynamicaly bind click function to div. This is how my code looks like: https://dpaste.de/4z1C
[05:28:28] <Cork> lalalaaa: scrollWidth
[05:28:32] <Cork> ?mdn scrollWidth
[05:28:46] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollWidth
[05:28:52] <Cork> so .prop('scrollWidth')
[05:29:14] <lalalaaa> oooh la la
[05:29:41] <lalalaaa> thank you Cork :-)
[05:29:45] <Cork> np
[05:34:19] <sebb> Any ideas ? I have 10 divs for which i cannot set click function staticly. I need to iterate through all my categories and on click display a popup content
[05:35:11] <lalalaaa> sebb: better if you set up a live test case: https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[05:35:29] <Cork> sebb: just use the delegate option for on
[05:35:35] <Cork> sebb: then bind it on a static parent
[05:35:49] <Cork> and preferably use jsfiddle not css-tricks
[05:36:17] <Cork> it provides tools to help make code managable, and responses is easy to give
[05:38:38] <sebb> But my html content is not static thats the point. It also generated dynamicaly. One question if I do something like this: '$("#"+some_id)' is it going to work ?
[05:38:51] <sebb> Stupid question, it has to
[05:39:54] <lalalaaa> Cork: the css-tricks one is just an article explaining why
[05:40:07] <Cork> ah
[05:40:11] <lalalaaa> but a very nice read
[05:40:25] <Cork> sebb: you can select based on that
[05:40:32] <Cork> but it won't find new elements later
[05:40:51] <Cork> it will only see the element matching that exactly when the $() function is executed
[05:41:19] <Cork> lalalaaa: also make sure you actually have to base it around dynamic ids
[05:41:27] <Cork> you might be able to write more dynamic selectors
[05:41:56] <Cork> like $('#group-parent .groups-of-element')
[05:42:10] <Cork> or $('#group-parent > li')
[05:42:41] <Cork> i get alarm bells in my head when i see ppl working with tons of dynamic ids (> 4)
[05:43:53] <sebb> why so ?
[05:44:09] <sebb> it's not a common a desirable action ?
[05:44:34] <Cork> cause it tends to result in $('#id1, #id2, #id3, #id4, #id5....') and that means the code can't adapt if you ever add an additional element
[05:44:41] <Whiskey> xec: https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/37/ <-- works perfect :D
[05:44:48] <Cork> the html structure should control the data, js should just make it "do things"
[05:46:00] <sebb> It does. I mean django controls it, it gets my values from db renders my context in template and then In jquery I try to iterate through my serialized table.
[05:46:25] <sebb> So there will not be more options than there will be in html dom
[05:47:37] <sebb> The only thing Im having trouble is to connect those elements in dom with those serialized elements. my div looks like this "<div id="{{ some_id_from_forloop }}">
[05:48:37] <sebb> Now It "kinda" works. It bounds click to all my elements (thats right) but it makes my popup being displayed only at last element
[05:51:01] <anli> I want to select a pixel in the browser window and get information about which element it belongs to and which style that made it have that color, is that possible?
[05:57:11] <lalalaaa> sebb: did you check out that article? is there no way you can create a js-only reduced test case?
[05:57:22] <lalalaaa> idk, seems people in here are only willing to help me if i have a reduced test case so..
[05:57:26] <lalalaaa> anyway good luck
[06:03:04] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/38/ <--- will it matter that both use same function name calc? Or will it be two diffrent anyways?
[06:03:55] <sebb> lalalaaa: ok thanks mate
[06:05:31] <Whiskey> yep that did not work :D
[06:14:51] <xec> Whiskey: there will be a separate calc function for each iteration
[06:20:54] <Whiskey> xec, but the results are not that
[06:21:34] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/40/ <--- you see type is same for both
[06:22:31] <Whiskey> feels like thats not correct
[06:24:39] <codecutter> how do i get the css property 'position' of an element through jq node?
[06:25:07] <xec> Whiskey: you're writing to the same element .Time in each function
[06:25:38] <Whiskey> yeh but that should not matter
[06:25:46] <xec> Whiskey: why not
[06:25:53] <codecutter> find the css position field of the following node $('.doo')...
[06:26:01] <codecutter> make sense?
[06:26:03] <Whiskey> var container = $(["pre."] + type);
[06:26:07] <Whiskey> makes sure its in pre.type
[06:26:22] <Whiskey> or is that not enoth?
[06:26:32] <xec> Whiskey: yes, you're making two time elements in different containers
[06:26:47] <xec> Whiskey: then you are selecting $(".Time") which will match both of them
[06:27:18] <xec> Whiskey: you could instead create a reference to the correct element and use that instead of selecting over and over
[06:27:43] <xec> Whiskey: or you could do container.find(".Time") instead
[06:28:12] <xec> to limit the search scope
[06:28:22] <Whiskey> yeh
[06:28:24] <Whiskey> :)
[06:29:04] <Whiskey> Thanks xec, im slow sometimes :D
[06:29:12] <codecutter> let me rephrase, anyone know how to retrieve the position property value (absolute, relative etc..) of an element through jquery?
[06:30:28] <xec> codecutter: $(selector).css("position") iirc
[06:31:37] <codecutter> let me try that
[06:31:48] <xec> codecutter: or you could have a look at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle
[06:37:22] <TeddyMurray> xec, did you see my PM?
[06:38:36] <codecutter> xec: can you tell me how to select all child elements except the first 2?
[06:56:45] <ULT> hi
[06:57:57] <ULT> I have this code: http://jsfiddle.net/ultimatia/vb8umouk/
[06:58:18] <ULT> But i get this warning: Uncaught ReferenceError: productPrice is not defined
[06:58:45] <ULT> I don`t understand why I get that error: it is a global variable.
[07:07:44] <shoky_> ULT: you're only defining it inside that function, and that function doesn't run before the console.log
[07:08:06] <shoky_> the console.log runs right away
[07:08:10] <shoky_> on page load
[07:08:13] <ULT> aah, because of the delay?
[07:08:17] <ULT> from 700ms?
[07:08:44] <shoky_> because of the delay and because of the change event handler.. there isn't even any input in the page ;p
[07:08:58] <shoky_> the function never runs
[07:09:17] <ULT> you are right. Not before we trigger it.
[07:09:35] <shoky_> so it's a timing issue, not a scope issue
[07:09:44] <ULT> thank you!
[07:09:54] <shoky_> np
[07:29:43] <thijn> i need help :D
[07:30:25] <taplar> ask away
[07:30:58] <hellyeah> http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/jquery-fundamentals
[07:31:05] <hellyeah> ,http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/jquery-getting-started
[07:31:16] <hellyeah> do you think this two links are useful
[07:31:44] <taplar> not sure, unfamiliar with them
[07:32:15] <thijn> well i am new to jquery and i want to make like an animated menu bar http://puu.sh/kCLaw/47aa81fa30.png this is the menu bar. and i want that line to align the link that you select
[07:32:37] <thijn> i dont know if you can help me here
[07:32:55] <hellyeah> good to make a fiddle
[07:34:35] <taplar> thijn: so your saying you want when you click a menu the little arrow slides over to the bottom right of the one you clicked?
[07:34:44] <thijn> yes
[07:34:53] <[non]> Date(123091231093) whats this date format
[07:34:55] <[non]> how can i filter it
[07:35:37] <taplar> thijn: that would be some sort of application of the animate() function adjusting the left or right to be under the element
[07:36:11] <taplar> js> Date(123091231093)
[07:36:18] <Cork> bot is dead
[07:36:21] <taplar> :(
[07:36:34] <thijn> i just can't figure it out how.. i tried it and watched alot of videos
[07:36:41] <thijn> but just cannot figure it out
[07:36:57] <taplar> thijn: so create a jsfiddle.net with what you have and we'll go from there
[07:37:07] <Cork> thijn: you would have to provide the html markup and the code for ppl to help you
[07:37:09] <[non]> how can i filter this
[07:37:11] <[non]> to yyyy-mm-dd
[07:37:20] <taplar> you mean format
[07:37:34] <[non]> yeah
[07:37:42] <Cork> [non]: there is no built in date format function
[07:37:47] <Cork> you would have to use a lib for that
[07:37:55] <Cork> like moment.js or strformat.js
[07:38:17] <thijn> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=eQs8Lv8DJw
[07:39:10] <taplar> thats blank
[07:39:17] <thijn> oh
[07:39:58] <taplar> thijn: when you say your new to jquery, how new?
[07:40:48] <Cork> thijn: there is a "save" button in jsfiddle click that
[07:40:52] <taplar> have you given try.jquery.com a lookie lew?
[07:40:59] <Cork> you'll get a new url share that
[07:43:01] <thijn> but i dont have anything usefull anymore..
[07:43:48] <taplar> we just need something to see what you've tried, where you've gotten to so far
[07:43:59] <taplar> we're about teaching you to code, not doing it for you
[07:45:07] <`ULT> shoky, do you have a suggestion how i can reach the variable outside the changehandler?
[07:45:22] <thijn> https://jsfiddle.net/pcve6wjh/#&togetherjs=eQs8Lv8DJw taplar here
[07:45:31] <thijn> that the only thing ive got now
[07:46:00] <thijn> i tried to figure it out with the offset right and stuff
[07:46:26] <taplar> alright, first thing, don't bind events in your html
[07:46:33] <taplar> do the binding in your js
[07:47:08] <taplar> $(elementSelector).on(event, function)
[07:47:46] <taplar> and try to be more descriptive in your function names.  a function name of '_' tells nothing about it's itent
[07:47:47] <taplar> intent
[07:49:38] <taplar> also, on that fiddle you'll need to bring in a version of jquery if your going to use it.  top left dropdown
[07:50:44] <thijn> oke
[07:50:58] <thijn> but what with the '_'?
[07:51:27] <taplar> function _(x)
[07:51:37] <taplar> what is '_'?  what is it supossed to do?
[07:51:48] <taplar> just from reading '_' i know nothing about it
[07:51:59] <taplar> function names should tell you something about their purpose

[08:02:42] <thijn> https://jsfiddle.net/pcve6wjh/#&togetherjs=eQs8Lv8DJw
[08:02:51] <thijn> that code doesnt do anything :d
[08:04:09] <taplar> well one thing i noticed before, i don't see the menu in the display area
[08:04:30] <thijn> i am testing locally tho
[08:05:25] <taplar> what do you mean?
[08:05:31] <thijn> with localhost
[08:05:35] <thijn> not jsfiddle
[08:05:44] <taplar> ~_~, so... how can i help if I can't see it.
[08:05:51] <taplar> that's why we have fiddle yo
[08:05:52] <thijn> that is just the code i got
[08:06:00] <thijn> oh
[08:06:56] <thijn> jsfiddle is new for me.. i dont know how it works
[08:07:34] <taplar> ok i can see the menu now
[08:08:03] <thijn> yha but not the arrow
[08:08:32] <taplar> the url to the image is broken
[08:08:44] <thijn> yha because it is stored on my pc
[08:08:53] <thijn> i guess
[08:10:12] <taplar> changed it to a character for now, for the experiment
[08:10:40] <thijn> yup i understand
[08:10:52] <thijn> did it just move?
[08:10:56] <taplar> alright so you want it in the bottom right of the link, right?
[08:13:43] <thijn> yes
[08:14:17] <taplar> ok, so open your console and click the link
[08:16:01] <thijn> yes i see numbers
[08:16:15] <taplar> alright so offset() tells you the position of the element
[08:16:24] <taplar> you can use that to know where to place your marker
[08:17:00] <thijn> but does that jquery code work? i dont see that arrow moving
[08:17:21] <taplar> i just saw it, did you?
[08:17:46] <thijn> no ;s
[08:18:38] <thijn> oh it did
[08:19:22] <taplar> ok, so now try using the offset left to do the animate
[08:19:36] <thijn_> oke browser crashed
[08:19:53] <thijn_> https://jsfiddle.net/pcve6wjh/5/#&togetherjs=h7iHwwDxQr
[08:22:52] <taplar> afc a sec
[08:23:51] <thijn_> uhmm the offset of the link was wrong wasnt it?
[08:31:26] <thijn_> oke localhost the image just jumps all the way to the left..

[08:39:15] <taplar> i'm going to have to step away and do some stuff here, but that's along the lines of what your looking for
[08:40:32] <thijn_> thanks alot!!!
[08:40:54] <taplar> some reason the width isn't giving me what i thought it should to push it to the right side
[08:43:40] <taplar> oh, it's probably because of the padding
[08:44:02] <taplar> hah!  yeah
[08:44:11] <taplar> left: ( $link.offset().left + $link.width() + 54 )
[08:44:38] <thijn_> thanks alot!!
[08:44:42] <thijn_> now i get it
[08:44:46] <`ULT> hi taplar, all the javascript from a site is obtainable by the Sources from a webpage?
[08:45:14] <taplar> unless it's loaded dynamically, in which case you'd have to check the network console to get them
[08:45:46] <`ULT> what do you mean exactely?
[08:46:14] <taplar> by 'sources' i assume you mean looking at the page source and clicking the script links?
[08:46:41] <`ULT> no
[08:47:12] <`ULT> I am using google chrome > developers tools > sources
[08:47:56] <taplar> ah, ok, i think my statement still applies
[08:48:04] <taplar> i'm not sure that dynamically loaded scripts show up in there
[08:48:18] <taplar> could be wrong
[08:49:49] <`ULT> i make a ascreenshot :p
[08:49:51] <taplar> and scripts ran from inside an iframe i also am unsure about
[08:50:39] <`ULT> This is what I see: http://prntscr.com/8p2vr2
[08:50:55] <`ULT> I have fixed almost my problems from yesterdat with live price update.
[08:51:01] <`ULT> But I think it is very poor coding.
[08:51:30] <thijn_> hmm taplar.. everytime i click the link the image starts left
[08:51:35] <thijn_> at like 0px
[08:52:13] <taplar> thijn_: you may want to calculate where it is going first.  and only do the animate if it is not already there
[08:52:32] <`ULT> So i try to find out how it is in the opencart software is handled.
[08:52:41] <taplar> or find the difference between where it is and where it should be and adjust by that
[08:52:52] <taplar> so if the same one is clicked it would adjust 0
[08:53:22] <`ULT> but therefore I first need to find the code what is responsible for it.
[08:53:36] <thijn_> ohh oke
[08:53:49] <thijn_> that is gonna be a big task
[08:53:52] <thijn_> :D
[08:54:27] <taplar> :) just experiment.  if you have questions i or others can help you.  i just got some work stuff i have to focus on now

[09:08:59] <K4T> hi
[09:09:48] <K4T> why that code: https://gist.github.com/K4T/3257999b7c1fddcb0203 not binding submit event from all forms with class .registration-form? It will bind only one form
[09:11:12] <TeddyMurray> K4T, i think you can just do $(".register-form").submit(...);
[09:12:47] <K4T> I tried it and still only submit event from one form is binded
[09:13:09] <TeddyMurray> hmm, let me make a jsfiddle
[09:13:52] <K4T> ok
[09:13:54] <K4T> nevermind
[09:13:57] <K4T> I found problem

[10:42:39] <YamakasY> I placed my fieldset + fieldset with some extar divs
[10:43:45] <Cork> YamakasY: you can't make a similar selector in that cause
[10:43:50] <Cork> *case
[10:44:02] <Cork> YamakasY: simplest solution is to just set a class on the div
[10:44:49] <Cork> YamakasY: an option you could do if that works is form.find('fieldset').eq(2)
[10:44:53] <Cork> but not sure if that works for you
[10:46:47] <YamakasY> Cork: okay but I need to generate 2 selectors than ?
[10:47:03] <Cork> that is one selector
[10:47:13] <Cork> it just only grabs the second match
[10:47:42] <YamakasY> Cork: yes but I need to make two with the same varname ?
[10:47:51] <Cork> uh, what?
[10:48:05] <Cork> YamakasY: i think you need to make a jsfiddle of the problem your having
[10:51:02] <YamakasY> Cork: I can do that, but I first need to understand why those divs are messing up my script
[10:51:28] <Cork> YamakasY: fieldset + fieldset is a css sibling selector
[10:51:29] <YamakasY> it cannot find something I guess and now it triggers the script on my document init
[10:51:37] <Cork> YamakasY: but they aren't siblings anymore
[10:51:48] <YamakasY> aha
[10:51:49] <YamakasY> yes
[10:51:52] <Cork> this has very little with js to do
[10:52:00] <Cork> it is straight css
[10:52:04] <YamakasY> oh!
[10:52:06] <YamakasY> sorry for that
[10:52:10] <PythDasch> Hi everyone, I'm trying to do a single form logic which every input filled, send an ajax request to see if the field is well filled. But I can't do it because async:true is deprecated. Do you know how I can do this ? thix in advance
[10:52:16] <Cork> YamakasY: no problem
[10:52:24] <Cork> YamakasY: it is still a valid question for this channel
[10:52:33] <Cork> as it is a fundamental part of jquery
[10:52:36] <YamakasY> Cork: but I'm sure they tell me to go to this channel when I show that pastie
[10:52:45] <YamakasY> yap
[10:53:06] <YamakasY> so I need to change that infoFieldset = $('fieldset + fieldset', form),
[10:53:11] <Cork> YamakasY: my point is just that the problem isn't really explained in jquery, cause it is in css
[10:53:24] <Cork> YamakasY: yes
[10:53:42] <Cork> it needs to either select based on a class/id on the fieldset you want
[10:53:54] <YamakasY> what is best to change it ? my issue is, I think I placed both in a div, so they are technical not next to eachother anymore
[10:54:00] <Cork> or you need to do something outside of css, as it doesn't provide what you need
[10:54:12] <Cork> YamakasY: hard to tell without seeing the problem
[10:54:25] <Cork> but from what you've shown, the simplest solution might be to just use an id
[10:54:29] <PythDasch> in fact I don't want to have async to true but to false. And this is not working
[10:54:46] <PythDasch> Apparently it's no more possible
[10:54:58] <Cork> PythDasch: async: true is the default
[10:55:04] <PythDasch> yes
[10:55:04] <Cork> PythDasch: it is async: false that is deprecated
[10:55:07] <PythDasch> and I changed it to false
[10:55:24] <PythDasch> Because I don't want the user to change of input till I don't clean the input
[10:55:35] <PythDasch> so How can I use this async:false ?
[10:55:42] <lordjancso> what is the best tool to manipulate browser url? i want my pages in a carousel, and if you click on a menu button, carousel just will slide from one to another, but i want to change the url after click on a menu button
[10:56:11] <PythDasch> you can add to the url parameters lordjan
[10:56:15] <PythDasch> lordjancso,
[10:56:20] <YamakasY> Cork: ok :)
[10:56:38] <lordjancso> PythDasch what do you mean?
[10:56:39] <NoiseEee> PythDasch: the correct way is *never* async:false
[10:56:41] <PythDasch> Cork, so it's no more possible to not doing it async ?
[10:56:50] <lordjancso> i have 2 menu buttons, menu1 and menu2
[10:56:52] <PythDasch> NoiseEee, I agree, but I need it ^^
[10:56:59] <NoiseEee> PythDasch: no, you can work around it
[10:57:07] <NoiseEee> PythDasch: or build logic / improve what you have
[10:57:08] <lordjancso> if i click on menu1, i want my browsers url to be domain.com/menu1
[10:57:11] <PythDasch> How can I check if the input is well filled without sending it to the server
[10:57:20] <lordjancso> if i cick on menu2, url would be domain.com/menu2
[10:57:25] <NoiseEee> PythDasch: you mean validate on the backend?
[10:57:36] <PythDasch> yes NoiseEee
[10:57:47] <NoiseEee> PythDasch: set the input to 'disabled' or 'readonly' or something while the xhr is happening
[10:57:48] <PythDasch> It's fullscreenform in fact
[10:58:03] <PythDasch> and how can I make this doing ?
[10:58:11] <NoiseEee> PythDasch: javascript and jquery?
[10:58:12] <lordjancso> but i dont want to refresh the whole page, just move carousel forward
[10:58:18] <PythDasch> like in beforeSend and after in complete?
[10:58:24] <PythDasch> NoiseEee, yes both
[10:58:30] <PythDasch> but my call is in jQuery
[10:58:38] <NoiseEee> PythDasch: so place it before your xhr call
[10:58:55] <PythDasch> ok and I disable it after complete ?
[10:59:03] <NoiseEee> function validate() {   this.lockForm();  this.doXHR();  }  eg
[10:59:10] <NoiseEee> PythDasch: exactly, on the success callback
[10:59:19] <NoiseEee> s/success/done/
[10:59:19] <b-ot> Correction, <NoiseEee> PythDasch: exactly, on the done callback
[10:59:29] <NoiseEee> YES b-ot!!!!!!!!!!!
[10:59:32] <PythDasch> ok then
[11:01:33] <NoiseEee> PythDasch: neeeeever  async:false.  you're in javascript land, embrace the async
[11:01:49] <PythDasch> ok :D
[11:05:33] <PythDasch> thanks NoiseEee I'll try
[11:08:58] <PythDasch> NoiseEee, I don't succeed :D http://pastebin.com/8VJ2LJz1
[11:10:13] <NoiseEee> PythDasch: thats the idea, are your selectors correct?
[11:10:24] <PythDasch> yes I checked with debugger
[11:10:28] <PythDasch> the disabled is good
[11:10:38] <PythDasch> but it's a dynamic form
[11:10:42] <NoiseEee> so whats not working?
[11:10:53] <PythDasch> it's only stop when I throw an error in the form
[11:11:08] <NoiseEee> i don't follow
[11:11:20] <PythDasch> in fact, because of the async, it doesn't go into !error
[11:11:28] <NoiseEee> why should it ever?
[11:11:46] <NoiseEee> why are you even defining error?
[11:15:34] <PythDasch> NoiseEee, this is the correct pastebin
[11:15:35] <PythDasch> http://pastebin.com/8Si9QYvQ
[11:15:46] <PythDasch> In fact, the form is validated if there is nothing in error variable
[11:16:02] <PythDasch> and if I add the error in the .done(function) it doesn't fill the error variable
[11:18:46] <bdmc> I am having a problem with setting the defaults for datepicker in Chrome.  Firefox works well, but Chrome complains: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'setDefaults' of undefined".   Any suggestions?
[11:19:12] <bdmc> I have put it inside $(document).ready(). No help.
[11:20:26] <NoiseEee> PythDasch: the if(error!=undefined) stuff needs to be in the callback too
[11:20:36] <NoiseEee> PythDasch: otherwise it's not waiting for the xhr to complete
[11:20:42] <NoiseEee> PythDasch: embrace... the... async...
[11:21:32] <shoky`> bdmc: sounds like jquery-ui isn't being loaded properly. would know better after seeing your code
[11:25:20] <PythDasch> NoiseEee, ok thx :) sorry I'm not so use of this sort of concept :D
[11:26:12] <PythDasch> but still it's fire the validation :(
[11:26:26] <PythDasch> It looks like it doesn't pass into the done function
[11:26:33] <PythDasch> or too late
[11:26:39] <bdmc> shoky`: That was something that I thought, too.  It does show up in the "network" list in Chrome.  There are far too many lines of code to try and send you, I'm afraid.  One thing that does concern me,
[11:27:43] <bdmc> is that it is inside a Joomla "wrapper," that is, it is running within a Joomla environment, and we have had issues with that messing up CSS and other things in the past.  The thing in particular that bothers me
[11:28:44] <bdmc> is that it seems to be providing jQuery 1.8.2, whereas I am loading 1.11.3 and jQuery-UI 1.11.4 as part of my code. ( both from code.jquery.com )
[11:29:50] <bdmc> shoky`: Can I somehow "ignore" the enclosing environment ( as far as jQuery is concerned ) and force it to use the version that I want?
[11:30:19] <shoky`> bdmc: my guess would be that your html is loading jquery, then jquery-ui,   then jquery again. and this last jquery include overwrites the previous jqui stuff
[11:30:44] <shoky`> it's best to just load one version exactly ;)
[11:30:46] <PythDasch> Sorry NoiseEee but I did already this and it's still not working because it's not in the flow
[11:31:09] <PythDasch> for one reason it just continue as the ajax never happens or too late
[11:32:33] <shoky`> bdmc:  though the fact that it's only in chrome seems to suggest its a different problem, donno
[11:32:40] <bdmc> My specific HTML, in that area, looks like: http://pastebin.ca/3185550
[11:33:13] <bdmc> I should have trimmed out the commented-out stuff.  Sorry.
[11:35:11] <bdmc> shoky`: I have been trying different orders of Script includes.
[11:36:12] <PythDasch> No one knows how ?
[11:36:41] <shoky`> bdmc: does chrome not give any other error?
[11:36:58] <bdmc> It just stops there.
[11:37:37] <shoky`> well, i mean before the setDefaults error
[11:38:01] <shoky`> like its having some problem loading jquery-ui
[11:38:19] <bdmc> No, sorry.  I meant, no there are no other errors.  There is a Warning about: Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help, check http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/.
[11:39:38] <shoky`> welp donno, either it's not being loaded properly, or something is overwriting it
[11:39:45] <bdmc> but it does, according to the Network tab, apparently load jquery-ui ( version 1.11.4 from code.jquery.com ) successfully.
[11:39:47] <shoky`> including jquery again can overwrite it
[11:40:11] <bdmc> Understood.  Let me carefully examine the Network tab and see if there is anything after that load.
[11:43:26] <bdmc> I don't think so.  After jquery-ui is listed in the Network tab, there are jquery.fancybox.pack.js, jqxcore.js, jqxwindow.js, jxqmaskedinput.js and jxqinput.js.
[11:45:03] <shoky`> got a live link?
[11:45:10] <`ULT> Hi, I have a question: Is one of both $(".options select") OR $(".options").find("select") better than the other?
[11:46:00] <shoky`> bdmc: also maybe try..  console.log($.fn.jquery);   do that once before the $(document).ready,  and once inside before calling setDefaults
[11:46:14] <shoky`> bdmc: to see if there's a diff jquery version maybe..
[11:46:41] <shoky`> `ULT: not really
[11:46:54] <`ULT> what do you prefer?
[11:47:16] <`ULT> Personaly I like ".options select" more than find("options")
[11:47:27] <shoky`> depends on the context,  but specifically for this i guess i'd go with the first
[11:47:31] <`ULT> *find (select)
[11:47:42] <shoky`> but anything a bit less simple and i'd go for the 2nd
[11:48:10] <bdmc> shoky`: Thank you.  I will try that.
[11:48:11] <`ULT> aah oke, When it is simple and easy to understand class select
[11:48:16] <`ULT> else .find
[11:48:27] <shoky`> for me, anyways ;p
[11:48:35] <`ULT> yeah, sounds legit :p
[11:49:03] <shoky`> bdmc: and you can try the same with $.ui.version  to get jquery-ui version
[11:52:04] <bdmc> shoky`: Good test, thanks.   "1.8.2" and "undefined"  Both before and after Document.ready.
[11:52:57] <bdmc> That 1.8.2 is coming from Joomla, I am sure.
[11:53:53] <shoky`> mm if it's undefined later maybe  try  jQuery.fn.jquery  instead of $.fn.jquery. maybe noConflict() is being called
[11:55:50] <bdmc> shoky`: Oh, yes.  That's what I had to do to get those numbers.  $ didn't work at all.
[11:56:02] <shoky`> ah
[11:56:08] <TeddyMurray> xec, you there?
[11:56:27] <bdmc> Hmmm.  Would jQuery.noConflict() help me?
[11:56:37] <bdmc> I suspect not.
[11:57:12] <shoky`> i try to stay away from it ;p and from trying to get 2 versions working on the same document
[11:57:36] <shoky`> usually doesn't work right,  though sometimes it does
[11:57:46] <duch_kazatel> the mental overhead is rarely worth it.
[11:57:56] <shoky`> aye
[11:58:08] <bdmc> I agree.  I would really rather not use two versions.  Maybe I should stop trying to use 1.11.3?
[11:58:17] <duch_kazatel> what versions are on the page?
[11:58:33] <bdmc> Since Joomla insists on loading 1.8.2 for me.
[11:59:14] <bdmc> 1.8.2 is part of the environment, but my page is trying to load 1.11.3 to support itself.
[11:59:36] <duch_kazatel> any way to upgrade to 1.11.3?
[11:59:42] <duch_kazatel> becuase otherwise i'd live in oldschool land.
[12:01:25] <bdmc> duch_kazatel: I don't have control over the Joomla environment. ( Well, I do, but we aren't going to upgrade Joomla any time soon. )
[12:01:38] <duch_kazatel> then i'd just deal with the older version.
[12:02:36] <bdmc> Off the top of your head, is there a 1.8.2 version of UI?
[12:02:46] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[12:02:55] <duch_kazatel> you mean a version of jquery ui compatible with 1.8.2?
[12:03:13] <bdmc> Either, I guess.
[12:03:33] <duch_kazatel> so jquery ui's versions are lockstepped with jquery.
[12:03:36] <duch_kazatel> that's why i'm asking :)
[12:03:53] <bdmc> I meant an actual version 1.8.2, but yes, you are right, the versions may not be exactly the same.
[12:04:35] <duch_kazatel> they aren't exactly the same - jqui is currently version 1.11.4 and is compatible with jquery 1.6 and above.
[12:05:28] <bdmc> Hmmm.  That's interesting.  So I could just leave out jQuery 1.11.3, and still load jQuery UI 1.11.4?
[12:05:36] <duch_kazatel> should be able to, yes.
[12:05:43] <bdmc> OK, let me try.
[12:06:45] <duch_kazatel> per https://jqueryui.com/ - check out the download box to the right :)
[12:12:32] <bdmc> duch_kazatel:  This is bizarre.  Chrome's Network tab shows jquery-ui loading successfully, but in  document.ready() it shows that $.ui.version is undefined.
[12:12:34] <disto> can I change css code from javascript ?
[12:12:45] <duch_kazatel> disto nope.
[12:13:06] <duch_kazatel> document ready is not the same as assets loaded :)
[12:13:09] <bdmc> duch_kazatel: Hmmm.  I go to the console now, and jQuery.ui.version reports 1.11.4, but inside jQuery( document ).ready(), it shows undefined.
[12:13:12] <duch_kazatel> your code still needs to be after jquery ui.
[12:13:16] <disto> duch_kazatel why ?
[12:13:23] <duch_kazatel> disto because you can't?
[12:13:37] <duch_kazatel> disto the CSSOM is separate from the DOM
[12:13:45] <disto> duch_kazatel, again. you know nothing.
[12:13:59] <duch_kazatel> pardon?
[12:14:11] <disto> i said you know nothing
[12:14:16] <Uhkis> lol
[12:14:26] <bdmc> Groan.  I wonder whether some kind of timer or something else would help.
[12:14:46] <bdmc> Single-threaded, but event-driven, right?
[12:15:01] <juro> http://jsfiddle.net/juro/vcubdp31/ why is the attribute undefined?
[12:15:04] <duch_kazatel> bdmc right.  just reorg your includes.  should be fine.
[12:16:07] <duch_kazatel> juro that's not how you use .click()
[12:16:13] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to use a delegated listener?
[12:16:31] <disto> can I make a lightbox visible when the user clicks "previous" button of browser ?
[12:17:33] <duch_kazatel> disto you can hook into the history popstate event and see.  a lot of browsers will probably just go to the previous page though and not run your code, unless you got them to that place using pushstates.
[12:18:00] <juro> duch_kazatel, ah sorry, I was under the impression that .click(...) is the same as .on('click', ...
[12:18:13] <duch_kazatel> juro it is, but it doesn't do delegation.
[12:18:35] <duch_kazatel> it supports direct bindings with an optional eventData parameter.
[12:19:00] <juro> weird, because this http://jsfiddle.net/juro/vcubdp31/1/ works ...
[12:19:09] <duch_kazatel> juro right.
[12:19:24] <duch_kazatel> because that's different from what you had before :) check the docs for https://api.jquery.com/click/
[12:20:12] <duch_kazatel> also, you generally want to avoid using data attributes for selecting.  and you really want to use .data() for data attributes.
[12:23:07] <juro> duch_kazatel, yes, I have read about the selecting part - what would the best practice be to hijack a link? I.e. I want to follow the link using ajax if Javascript is available.
[12:23:23] <duch_kazatel> why do you want to do that?
[12:23:27] <juro> what do you mean with "you really want to use .data() for data attributes"?
[12:23:34] <duch_kazatel> .data('target') in this case.
[12:23:51] <juro> ah, ok.
[12:24:08] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vcubdp31/2/ like this
[12:24:16] <juro> Because I can deprecate the javascript elegantly that way
[12:24:56] <duch_kazatel> scope down where your binding is.  and my question was more specific to loading content via ajax - is it just part of the page you're concerned with?
[12:25:30] <duch_kazatel> because i'd make sure your server is giving you proper fragments and all that if you haven't already done that.
[12:25:58] <juro> duch_kazatel, yes and I only want to follow specific links using ajax
[12:26:13] <juro> other's are loaded just as normal links
[12:26:40] <duch_kazatel> then yeah, scope your selectors down just to the areas it matters.  instead of $(document), target the section of the page you're working with.
[12:27:18] <NoiseEee> PythDasch: pastebin your latest
[12:27:41] <PythDasch> NoiseEee, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33020286/fullscreenform-validation-every-input-filled
[12:27:45] <PythDasch> you will have all the informations
[12:28:15] <duch_kazatel> need to .bind()
[12:28:24] <duch_kazatel> function() {}.bind(this)
[12:29:08] <juro> ah, that makes sense. However, the HTML structure looks like this: http://jsfiddle.net/juro/vcubdp31/4/
[12:29:45] <duch_kazatel> then give those particular URLs a class.
[12:30:16] <NoiseEee> PythDasch: i told you to put the error check in the callback, otherwise it runs RIGHT AWAY
[12:30:29] <PythDasch> I did it
[12:30:29] <juro> duch_kazatel, is that best practice?
[12:30:30] <VictorCL> $('*').on("click",function(){  $('*').on("click",function(){  $('*').on("click",function(){   $('*').on("click",function(){    });   });   });   });
[12:30:33] <PythDasch> You can see it
[12:30:38] <NoiseEee> PythDasch: no, its not
[12:30:41] <duch_kazatel> VictorCL wat
[12:30:44] <duch_kazatel> juro yes.
[12:30:56] <juro> duch_kazatel, ok, thx
[12:30:58] <PythDasch> the if data['status'] == error does it
[12:31:07] <LindsayM_> Hey guys/ i'm back with some more JSON structure questions...
[12:31:07] <NoiseEee> PythDasch: if( error!= undefined)     block needs to go in the .done() callback
[12:31:10] <PythDasch> after it launch the error
[12:31:20] <PythDasch> It's the same as I did
[12:31:24] <NoiseEee> error is not defined until is done
[12:31:38] <PythDasch> Yes this is the problem
[12:31:39] <NoiseEee> PythDasch: good luck, your paste does not illustrate what i told you you need to do
[12:32:05] <PythDasch> NoiseEee, did you have the last link on stack overflow ?
[12:32:06] <LindsayM_> So thanks to duch_kazatel i understand better about the .map() function but from what I can tell, it flattens arrays. I have a tested array inside of each object and I'm having a hard time figuring out how to get all of the values of "urls" array in each object. Here is my data example http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/ufaoqaak/7/
[12:32:18] <NoiseEee> PythDasch: yes.
[12:32:22] <NoiseEee> PythDasch: if( error!= undefined)     block needs to go in the .done() callback
[12:32:32] <NoiseEee> ^^ it is NOT in the .done() callback in that stackoverflow example
[12:32:42] <PythDasch> so you can see in .done {  this._showError(error) }
[12:32:55] <duch_kazatel> LindsayM_ so you want to grab all the URLs?
[12:33:00] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  yes..
[12:33:03] <NoiseEee> PythDasch: the block I am talking about starts with if( error != undefined ) {
[12:33:08] <PythDasch> I just removed the if ( error != undefined) because I know there is a mistake
[12:33:11] <duch_kazatel> and do what with them?
[12:33:17] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  basically the idea is to display each name and all associatd URLS for that name...
[12:33:53] <duch_kazatel> so think of the map as working on each object separately.
[12:34:04] <duch_kazatel> how would you grab those URLs in a normal function?
[12:34:14] <duch_kazatel> if you were just working with one object?
[12:34:24] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel: I mean, in PHP i would loop through each of them.
[12:34:37] <duch_kazatel> in javascript though.
[12:34:56] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel: I would probably do $.each()
[12:35:03] <duch_kazatel> ew.
[12:35:11] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel: I know.. i know.. you've told me that was bad in the past..
[12:35:38] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  i dont actually know what the alternative is outside of map which, from what I have read, isn't the right one either.. right?
[12:35:56] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  or is it for(). ?
[12:36:00] <duch_kazatel> it depends on what you want them to look like.
[12:36:05] <duch_kazatel> and never for when working with arrays.
[12:36:22] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ufaoqaak/8/
[12:36:27] <duch_kazatel> also cleaned up your event binding a little.
[12:38:04] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  that returns [object Object][object Object] for the urls..?
[12:38:09] <duch_kazatel> no.
[12:38:14] <duch_kazatel> that's returning an object with 2 keys
[12:38:16] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel: I had actually gotten that far but then got stuck last night
[12:38:33] <duch_kazatel> what do you want the return to be then?
[12:39:21] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel: So if that's returning an object with two keys, how do I return the values of those two keys?
[12:39:30] <duch_kazatel> err.
[12:39:55] <duch_kazatel> so for each item in that array, you're getting back an object with two keys.
[12:40:21] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  the goal is to have it return a generic structure like this: Record1 pic1 pic2 pic3, Record2 pic1 pic2, Record3 pic1 , etc..
[12:40:43] <duch_kazatel> is that supposed to be an array of strings?
[12:40:54] <duch_kazatel> or what?
[12:41:19] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  No i'm not giving you actual data formatting. Just trying to show that each img path should be grouped with it;s record.
[12:41:32] <LindsayM_> maybe that was confusing.. if so, disregard.
[12:41:43] <duch_kazatel> very - that's not a "data format".
[12:41:46] <duch_kazatel> that's just a string.
[12:42:27] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel: I just mean that is a data mockup.. how I want the data grouped... not a list of names and then a list of urls..
[12:42:43] <duch_kazatel> so you want an array of strings?
[12:45:07] <duch_kazatel> also: your urls array is... strange.
[12:45:57] <duch_kazatel> from what i can tell, you want something like http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ufaoqaak/9/
[12:46:20] <duch_kazatel> this still doesn't properly print the urls, but i'm not sure that's the format you really want for those in the first place.
[12:46:23] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  yea I just realized the URL formatting inthe jsfiddle doesn't exactly match what my site is outputting.. lemme fix that
[12:51:03] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  I can't seem to figure out how to format my JSON to reflect what I have returning from my php but to give you an idea of what i'm actually working with http://cl.ly/image/292t2Y2j0n3n
[12:51:13] <LindsayM_> I am working on rebuilding the JSON nonUsers properly
[12:51:17] <duch_kazatel> JSON.stringify() that data
[12:51:26] <duch_kazatel> done.
[12:51:51] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  so JSON.stringify(currentNonUser.urls ) ?
[12:51:59] <duch_kazatel> no.
[12:52:05] <duch_kazatel> instead of "rebuilding" that data.
[12:52:20] <duch_kazatel> you're console logging it, so console.log(JSON.stringify(yourData));
[12:52:44] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  i'm sorry, i feel like an idiot.. but what "yourData"?
[12:52:57] <LindsayM_> you mean the WHOLE thing? or just the urls part?
[12:53:02] <duch_kazatel> the whole thing.
[12:53:07] <duch_kazatel> not in the map.
[12:53:27] <duch_kazatel> instead of trying to manually rebuild your object in the fiddle, just share the data.
[12:53:31] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  then how do I get each item's value? do I do it with something like jsonResp.name ?
[12:53:41] <duch_kazatel> lol
[12:53:43] <duch_kazatel> you're confused.
[12:53:44] <duch_kazatel> i apologize.
[12:53:47] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  yup. I am
[12:53:51] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel: i'm trying though.
[12:53:54] <duch_kazatel> i'm just trying to get an accurate copy of your data.
[12:53:58] <LindsayM_> Ohhhhhh ok
[12:53:59] <duch_kazatel> so we can put that in the fiddle and work against that.
[12:54:39] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel: ok i gotcha
[12:57:38] <duch_kazatel> LindsayM_ >.> still having problems?
[12:59:35] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  just double checking my data.. one sec
[13:05:42] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel: hmm ok. So if i do stringify on this the URL's array gets sent as two strings added together
[13:05:53] <duch_kazatel> that's not what i was telling you to do.
[13:06:06] <duch_kazatel> i was asking you to stringify the json you're getting from your server and to share that out in the fiddle.
[13:06:10] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  i'm dumping the whole thing like 			console.log(JSON.stringify(jsonResp));
[13:06:14] <duch_kazatel> right.
[13:06:17] <duch_kazatel> now share that data.
[13:06:18] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  ok lemme show you
[13:09:08] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/ufaoqaak/12/
[13:09:38] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  I just notice that if i do a console.log(jsonResp) the urls actually look like all one string instead of returning as an array object.
[13:10:11] <duch_kazatel> that has nothing to do with the actual data format ;)
[13:10:17] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel: ok
[13:10:55] <duch_kazatel> so http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ufaoqaak/13/
[13:10:57] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel: I was just concerned because the log for that data doesn't look like the log for the same dat aon my server
[13:11:00] <duch_kazatel> is this kind of what you're looking for?
[13:11:04] <LindsayM_> even though it was copy/pasted
[13:11:05] <LindsayM_> lemme look
[13:11:12] <duch_kazatel> you're conflating PHP and JS.
[13:11:59] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel: how though? the php is just sitting on the server doing json_encode($response); the console.log() is displaying the JSON response from the server
[13:12:22] <duch_kazatel> console.log() formats objects in a particular way to make them easier to read and understand.
[13:12:30] <duch_kazatel> that's why you console.log() the stringified version
[13:12:37] <duch_kazatel> that was you can actually see the data.
[13:12:38] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  so in that link, I don't think that is what i want because that is listing three images.. where do those images come from?
[13:12:49] <duch_kazatel> what is it that you want, then?
[13:12:56] <duch_kazatel> update that fiddle to show me what you're looking for.
[13:13:02] <duch_kazatel> *with some sample output.
[13:14:29] <Qiller> friends, when i use ajax post, return it: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource
[13:14:36] <Qiller> anyone can help me ? =D
[13:14:41] <duch_kazatel> Qiller that means the server doesn't allow CORS.
[13:15:17] <duch_kazatel> do you control the server in question?
[13:15:26] <Qiller>  duch_kazatel ftp access only
[13:15:41] <duch_kazatel> then you're SOL unless you put the JS on the same port, protocol, and domain
[13:16:15] <Qiller> hm, cant i solve this?
[13:16:36] <duch_kazatel> if all you have is FTP access and you can't move the page to the same domain, then no.
[13:16:45] <Qiller> ;(
[13:16:50] <duch_kazatel> you'd need to proxy through your own server and use a server-side utility.
[13:17:14] <Qiller> external php receive my post and execute all commands by post
[13:17:55] <duch_kazatel> Qiller if your page is not on the same port, protocol, and domain as the endpoint you're hitting, you have no other real options.
[13:18:24] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  i guess i can't figure out if (in the urls data) I need one array with two records or two array's with one record. Right now my server is outputting two arrays with one record each like array("urls" array( "0" => "path.to.img.jpg", "1" => "another.img.jpg"));
[13:18:46] <duch_kazatel> LindsayM_ stop looking at the input data.
[13:18:53] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: have any limit to GET string on url? via ajax jsonp. i have big data, like base64 encoded image
[13:18:55] <duch_kazatel> what output do you want from the function?
[13:19:09] <duch_kazatel> Qiller jsonp has to be explicitly supported by the endpoint.
[13:19:18] <duch_kazatel> and there are limits, but it depends on the server.
[13:19:21] <Qiller> support jsonp
[13:19:40] <duch_kazatel> okay, then you can use that.
[13:20:32] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: 500k base64_decode image via get? =x have no str limit &var=base64...
[13:20:43] <Qiller> by default
[13:20:45] <duch_kazatel> that will likely be too much.
[13:20:52] <duch_kazatel> that should really be posted.
[13:21:00] <Qiller> trying
[13:21:56] <tps9tb> Hey all, sorry to bother you... Does anyone have a few to DM me and help me with a jQuery issue?
[13:22:07] <duch_kazatel> tps9tb nop DMs - just ask the channel.
[13:22:29] <duch_kazatel> using DMs completely circumvents the point of the channel :)
[13:23:26] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  does this help you visualize what my ultimate goal is? http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/ufaoqaak/14/
[13:23:37] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  I am SOO sorry I seem like i'm being dense. I feel like an idiot here.
[13:24:07] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  but that jsfiddle has the markup that ultimately I want to display and how it should be displayed. HOW i get to that end result is what I'm stuck on.
[13:24:22] <tps9tb> Ok, well I am running into an issue where I am attempting to hide a div with jQuery's hide() function and then later show() it.  When I show it, all of the classes on each element seem to be reverted back to their original classes from the html file.  I've tried to debug it by adding breakpoints and tracing where the functions go, and it seems that after my eventlistener, it hits some default jQuery functions and for some reason at t
[13:24:25] <tps9tb> set
[13:24:34] <duch_kazatel> tps9tb woah that's a paragraph.  have a jsfiddle to show?
[13:25:01] <tps9tb> I'll make one real quick
[13:25:11] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: post and callback via jsonp work ? or get only?
[13:25:28] <LindsayM_> Tadas:  you're adding the lost classes with JS after the DOM is loaded?
[13:25:29] <duch_kazatel> Qiller jsonp is a normally http requect that takes a callback.
[13:25:38] <duch_kazatel> LindsayM_ okay, so you're really conflating this :) you need to go from some JSON to outputting markup, right?
[13:25:39] <Qiller> hmm
[13:25:51] <tps9tb> https://jsfiddle.net/t5xva3c5/ duch_kazatel
[13:26:00] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  yea.
[13:26:20] <duch_kazatel> LindsayM_ do you have underscore available?
[13:26:30] <tps9tb> It's a very simple function, but the default jQuery functions are what's causing the issue
[13:26:47] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel: the markup / outputting markup on a page isn't the issue so much as the proper way to get the multiple value "urls" data from inside of the 'user' record.
[13:27:00] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  no. I am working with WordPress so no JS templating engines unfortunately.
[13:27:27] <duch_kazatel> tps9tb so hold up, using .show() after using .hide() reverts the element back to its initial state - is that the issue?
[13:27:51] <tps9tb> yeah, it doesn't keep classes on it that were altered before the hide() and show() functions were called
[13:28:04] <tps9tb> but I can't find anything in the jQuery documentation to suggest that this should happen
[13:28:58] <duch_kazatel> 1 sec.
[13:30:40] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  do you have a working fiddle with the markup so we can click around adn see it in action?
[13:31:26] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  and the container in question is #cyfe-display ?
[13:31:55] <tps9tb> The container is menu-nav
[13:32:16] <LindsayM_> tps9tb: so where are you adding a class to that???
[13:32:20] <tps9tb> I want to hide it while the cyfe-display is shown, and then show it again with everything selected like before after I click back
[13:32:24] <LindsayM_> Taggnostr: i dont see an addClass for that one
[13:32:38] <tps9tb> bootstrap handles that, it adds an "active" class
[13:32:49] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  how?
[13:32:54] <tps9tb> I can try to get a working fiddle up, but will need to add my css files and what not
[13:33:01] <tps9tb> through javascript
[13:33:07] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  thats fine. JSfiddle can handle it
[13:33:17] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  i know JS does it.. but how/ when/ etc
[13:33:20] <tps9tb> Alright I'll try and throw that up
[13:34:31] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  it's possible that class added is dependent upon something else so it's not adding it back once it's removed from the DOM ..
[13:35:35] <tps9tb> Sorry, I'm not familiar with jsfiddle, how can I add multiple files?
[13:35:52] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  on the left, external resources.. paste a link directly to your resources
[13:35:55] <tps9tb> wow nvm... would help if I looked around a bit
[13:35:58] <tps9tb> haha
[13:36:29] <tps9tb> And that will work if it's all hosted locally, correct?
[13:36:39] <taplar> no
[13:36:49] <taplar> it will only work for you
[13:36:58] <taplar> unless we can also hit your local server
[13:37:17] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  yea unless your local server is open to the world.. then no.
[13:37:29] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  you can use any file server though that lets you direct link. So something like dropbox would even work
[13:37:46] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  but if you're looking at boostrap I think there's a CDN for bootstrap files
[13:37:57] <LindsayM_> tps9tb: http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/
[13:38:07] <taplar> google also has various files in its developer cdn
[13:38:29] <LindsayM_> ^ just make sure you're getting the right version.
[13:38:38] <LindsayM_> (and by right I mean the one you are using)
[13:40:19] <tps9tb> Yeah, I have it up to where the html is showing, but my js isn't working on it as of now
[13:40:51] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  make sure you're also including the jQuery library
[13:41:01] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  there is an option to select which library you want to include
[13:41:11] <tps9tb> -_- whoops
[13:42:31] <tps9tb> Ok now part of it is working
[13:42:34] <tps9tb> we're getting somewhere
[13:43:32] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  good stuff...
[13:45:50] <tps9tb> This might be where my issue is
[13:46:04] <tps9tb> so now it works, but when you click the back button on fiddle, it says the page doesn't exist?
[13:46:05] <taplar> i agree
[13:46:27] <LindsayM_> taplar:  the back button on a fiddle isn't going to work.
[13:46:37] <taplar> *shrug* i can't see anything
[13:46:51] <LindsayM_> taplar:  lets see your fiddle.. what do you mean you cant see anything/
[13:47:01] <tps9tb> https://jsfiddle.net/t5xva3c5/16/
[13:47:05] <taplar> there we go
[13:47:22] <tps9tb> sorry, didn't realize it made a new one every time
[13:47:31] <tps9tb> <---- noobie to fiddle
[13:47:46] <LindsayM_> taplar:  it just makes a new verion each tine you click UPDATE but you can click RUN to update the code without creating a new version
[13:47:52] <LindsayM_> taplar:  so tell me how to test / replicate this
[13:48:00] <tps9tb> Oh haha thanks
[13:48:04] <taplar> i'm aware of how fiddle works
[13:48:11] <taplar> i was commenting about tps9tb
[13:48:20] <LindsayM_> oops sorry taplar that was for tps9tb
[13:48:21] <tps9tb> Select any topic, then click the drop down of any section, then select one of the buttons and the dashboard should appear
[13:48:33] <LindsayM_> my IRC client seems to not be using the autocomplete the way it always had
[13:48:50] <tps9tb> Then click the back button and "it should" bring back the menu with all the buttons and whatnot selected still
[13:49:06] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  umm the browser back button??
[13:49:31] <taplar> i don't see a menu on /16  only "Page Background", even when i change it to use a jquery version
[13:49:39] <tps9tb> sorry the button on the page
[13:49:50] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  scroll ALL the way down
[13:50:00] <taplar> snap, lol
[13:50:21] <tps9tb> sorry, the custom back button was being hidden, so I had to put a top margin to show the button, made it a bit big
[13:50:22] <LindsayM_> arg.. taplar not tps9tb
[13:50:23] <LindsayM_> grrrr
[13:50:33] <tps9tb> close enough
[13:50:48] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  so to start, you have an error in your JS
[13:50:58] <tps9tb> Alright, where at?
[13:51:10] <LindsayM_> tps9tb: Uncaught TypeError: $(...).on is not a function
[13:51:28] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  it happens when I click a menu item to load the dashboard window
[13:52:14] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  ok so you're using jquery 1.11??
[13:52:20] <tps9tb> Ah, i believe that is an issue with dumping the cyfe dashboard into the iframe
[13:52:38] <tps9tb> Not really something I can fix unfortunately, and yes
[13:52:38] <tps9tb> 1.11.3
[13:53:04] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  so rule #1 is to get rid of your errors before debugging
[13:53:30] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  the prblem is that i THINK that error is related to the version of jquery you are using versus the code you're using
[13:54:14] <tps9tb> I see, well if you go to the dashboard's original URL https://app.cyfe.com/dashboards/682/4f1e480ccb8cf101202552286564 you will get the same 7 errors
[13:54:33] <tps9tb> So I'm not quite sure how to fix that since I have no control over it. They are a 3rd party service
[13:55:07] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  hmmmmm ok
[13:55:36] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  hmmm...
[13:55:57] <taplar> lol, nice
[13:56:01] <tps9tb> I've been scratching my head over this for hours now
[13:56:01] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  so I have NO IDEA how any of this actually relates to your problem of a div loosing classes...
[13:56:26] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  from what I can see, your back button isn't even firing (its just doing it's normal function of trying to load a url path)
[13:56:56] <tps9tb> So when I test it locally in chrome, when I hit that back button, i get, essentially, the menu that you would get when you load the page for the first time
[13:57:12] <tps9tb> It isn't simply "showing" the old div
[13:57:51] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  thats because it's reloading the page...
[13:57:59] <tps9tb> the event listener for my button fires when I click the button
[13:58:04] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  its not showing  / hiding.. its reloading the page (from what I can tell)
[13:58:13] <tps9tb> After it shows the div
[13:58:25] <tps9tb> Why would it do any of that from the get-go
[13:58:31] <tps9tb> I simply just made "<button type='button' id='back-button'>Back</button>"
[13:59:00] <taplar> that button is inside an <a> tag
[13:59:15] <tps9tb> oh my god.... -_-
[13:59:23] <tps9tb> I see what you mean taplar haha
[13:59:49] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  your <a> tag has a APP_BASE_URL
[13:59:53] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  its loading that...
[14:00:23] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  take a look at your page source while on the dashboard. Click the BACK button and watch to see if the source refreshes (blinks off and then back on) or if it just updates
[14:00:32] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  if you're in chrome use web inspector
[14:00:36] <tps9tb> Oh wow haha
[14:00:40] <tps9tb> wow wow wow
[14:00:49] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  amiright?
[14:00:50] <taplar> mind...... blown
[14:01:08] <LindsayM_> taplar:  you have to do preventDefault() on your link
[14:01:08] <tps9tb> So why does it affect the button and not the whole area? I guess because it should be in the a tag's content but I moved it out
[14:01:15] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  huh?
[14:01:31] <tps9tb> I'm just shocked that that was the issue
[14:01:40] <tps9tb> preventDefault() in the jquery
[14:01:42] <tps9tb> ?
[14:01:52] <taplar> what's the purpose of the link?
[14:02:00] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  I dont understand your last question
[14:02:19] <tps9tb> I think I answered my own question
[14:02:32] <tps9tb> I was wondering why the area between the button and the a tag didn't bring me back
[14:02:45] <taplar> if you don't what that link to happen for the button, but do for the rest of the stuff, just move the button right before the <a>
[14:02:46] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  because there's nothing in there. its just margin space
[14:02:49] <tps9tb> but it's because I moved the back button out of the a tag on the actual page, not the code
[14:02:50] <taplar> no need to cancel it then
[14:03:05] <LindsayM_> " on the actual page, not the code" ?
[14:03:49] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  but yes. if you move the button outside of the <a> tag then you don't have to prevent the default behavior of the <a> link which is to load in a new page
[14:03:54] <tps9tb> visually, it is outside the a tag, but not in the code
[14:03:54] <tps9tb> soryr, that was a bad explanation
[14:04:09] <LindsayM_> tps9tb:  yea still not fully understanding but ok...
[14:04:31] <tps9tb> haha never mind then, sorry
[14:04:32] <taplar> also side note, seriously, you should let that 3rd party know about their errors.  that's crappy
[14:04:43] <LindsayM_> +1 ^
[14:05:00] <tps9tb> Yeah, I already have, they have a lot of other errors with their code, not sure why we pay them for this, but hey, I'm just a student
[14:05:05] <tps9tb> Not coming out of my pocket :)
[14:05:31] <tps9tb> Thanks for helping me debug my really really stupid error, I'm going to pay much more attention to that next time :/
[14:05:39] <tps9tb> +1 to you both
[14:07:48] <tps9tb> Thanks again, cheers
[14:08:01] <graphettion> anyone know a polyfill to convert the <audio> tag to support IE8?
[14:08:44] <LindsayM_> does this room have a .tell bot.
[14:08:48] <LindsayM_> ?
[14:09:13] <LindsayM_> graphettion: https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-Browser-Polyfills
[14:09:49] <graphettion> ty LindsayM_
[14:10:04] <taplar> what's a tell bot?
[14:10:05] <LindsayM_> .tell hey there > lindsaym_
[14:10:40] <LindsayM_> taplar:  it's an IRC bot that you can use to leave people from this room messages if they leave. The bot will store the messages and relay them to the user next time they are in this room
[14:10:58] <taplar> ah, no clue
[14:11:00] <LindsayM_> taplar:  so something like /tell just wanted to let you know I got that code working > taplar
[14:11:16] <LindsayM_> would post the message "just wanted to let you know I got that code working" next time you're in the room
[14:11:33] <taplar> fwiw if we get one I want it to be named "butler"
[14:11:45] <LindsayM_> taplar:  or jeeves...
[14:12:02] <LindsayM_> taplar:  or Alfred...
[14:12:13] <LindsayM_> Alfred Pennyworth
[14:12:22] <LindsayM_> taplar:  does this room even have a bot?
[14:12:33] <taplar> there is b-ot sporatically
[14:12:38] <LindsayM_> .fiddle
[14:12:47] <LindsayM_> .help
[14:12:50] <LindsayM_> hmmm...
[14:14:20] <LindsayM_> taplar:  oh well... dont know anything about the b-ot unfortunately.
[14:17:01] <LindsayM_> .args
[14:18:25] <LindsayM_> .message testing lindsaym_
[14:18:46] <taplar> b-ot: echo hi

[14:19:55] <LindsayM_> it seems as though the bot does NOT wanna work
[14:20:02] <LindsayM_> oh wait...
[14:20:14] <LindsayM_> its posting the results as notices to <freenode>
[14:20:22] <LindsayM_> weird that it's not putting them in the room
[14:20:33] <LindsayM_> taplar:  check your notices and see if you got the one for api hide from b-ot
[14:20:50] <taplar> not that i see
[14:20:52] <LindsayM_> `help
[14:21:07] <LindsayM_> taplar:  do yoiu know how to check the notices?
[14:21:18] <taplar> i got a status window
[14:21:23] <LindsayM_> taplar:  http://cl.ly/image/1G0z1w1o0S3X
[14:21:31] <LindsayM_> taplar: what IRC client are you using>
[14:21:44] <taplar> webchat
[14:22:14] <Uhkis> poor b-ot
[14:22:42] <LindsayM_> taplar:  on the side where you have a list of rooms you are in, do you see a top level container called freenode?
[14:22:52] <taplar> i hid that, :D
[14:22:53] <taplar> hold on
[14:22:57] <LindsayM_> taplar:  ah ok.
[14:23:16] <LindsayM_> That is where your notices display. Anytime oyu log in or do anything with nickserv or whatever they will display there.
[14:23:27] <LindsayM_> apparently b-ot is recording there instead
[14:23:31] <taplar> nope, no top level
[14:23:44] <Uhkis> `api hide
[14:23:56] <LindsayM_> taplar:  huh?
[14:24:04] <Uhkis> b-ot is getting more and more unstable by the day
[14:24:07] <taplar> `api test
[14:24:20] <taplar> nah, nothing for me
[14:24:27] <LindsayM_> Tak0r|3:  private message?
[14:24:30] <LindsayM_> taplar: ^
[14:24:42] <LindsayM_> arg.. why is my IRC client not autofilling the last used names anymore!
[14:25:32] <LindsayMac> ok
[14:25:35] <LindsayMac> Better
[14:26:27] <LindsayMac> ` api hide @taplar
[14:26:33] <LindsayMac> `api hide @taplar
[14:26:47] <taplar> why do you keep trying to hide me?!  are you saying i'm ugly!!!
[14:26:48] <LindsayMac> ^ now taplar ?
[14:26:50] <taplar> *cries*
[14:26:59] <LindsayMac> taplar: lol...
[14:27:02] <taplar> nothing
[14:27:06] <LindsayMac> taplar:  just trying to send you something from b-ot
[14:27:09] <taplar> may not be something it does in the webchat
[14:27:14] <LindsayMac> taplar:  nothing in PMs?
[14:27:18] <taplar> nope
[14:27:28] <LindsayMac> taplar:  what is webchat? is it a native app or a browser IRC client?
[14:27:32] <taplar> http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#jquery
[14:27:36] <Uhkis> it's well established that the bot is broken atm
[14:27:45] <LindsayMac> `api twitter @LindsayMac
[14:27:57] <LindsayMac> `api twitter
[14:28:17] <LindsayMac> `api slideUp
[14:28:26] <LindsayMac> Uhkis: yup.. i killed it. It's doing NOTHING now.
[14:28:28] <LindsayMac> oh well.
[14:28:50] <LindsayMac> it worked (kinda) for a hot minute
[14:29:37] <LindsayMac> #wordpress used to have a nice one.. unfortunately the guy maintaining it disappeared along with his bot :(
[14:29:49] <LindsayMac> that was the first one I had seen with the .tell feature.. and a few other cool features as well.
[14:44:52] <g2nightmare> can anyone help me use jquery rather than build a string?
[14:44:56] <g2nightmare> here is what i have currently https://dpaste.de/aNrM
[14:46:01] <taplar> what are you wanting?  to build the elements instead of the html?
[14:46:04] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: i don't understand
[14:46:35] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: you are using jquery in that example, making elements two different ways... on line 11 versus the strings that 'calendar' holds
[14:46:35] <g2nightmare> yes taplar
[14:46:51] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: so instead of using strings, create elements like you did on line 11
[14:46:52] <g2nightmare> yes noise i know it should be commented out because im changing it?
[14:46:57] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: but why change at all?
[14:47:05] <g2nightmare> because it looks cleaner i suppose?
[14:47:15] <g2nightmare> i dont want to make like 8 or 11 variables and then append them all
[14:47:16] <PlanC> is it a good idea to just use $("#id").html("test"); on all pages even if #id doesn't exist?
[14:47:27] <PlanC> or do I have to check for #id before I run it?
[14:47:31] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: but.... you just asked to do that
[14:47:33] <taplar> PlanC: doesn't hurt anything
[14:47:45] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: your choice are create 8 or 11 variables and append them all, or use strings to make your html
[14:47:55] <PlanC> so I'll just use that and it'll ignore it if #id doesn't exist on the page?
[14:47:56] <g2nightmare> but can't you add them all ?
[14:48:13] <g2nightmare> i can't make one calendar variable and add to it?
[14:48:19] <g2nightmare> just like i did in string building?
[14:48:20] <PlanC> taplar: I mean, is it bad practice?
[14:48:23] <g2nightmare> only with jquery?
[14:48:32] <taplar> PlanC: if it does not exist, then the text() will happen on an empty object, which will just result in nothing happening
[14:48:33] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: uh sure, but i don;t think you know what 'jquery' is ?
[14:48:41] <taplar> PlanC: not that i'm aware of
[14:49:02] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: you'd still have to append() your <th> to your <thead>, and all that jazz
[14:49:02] <g2nightmare> i thought jquery gives me the advantage of adding to the document
[14:49:18] <g2nightmare> instead of building a string and setting html
[14:49:20] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: jquery is a library that among other things, assists in element creation and adding to the DOM
[14:49:38] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: you would be unable to build a string like you do in your example without jquery.
[14:49:52] <NoiseEee> (a string that goes in as proper DOM elements)
[14:50:07] <PlanC> taplar: it won't cause IE to start burning or anything similar?
[14:50:14] <taplar> nope
[14:50:37] <Log1x> I'm using http://hastebin.com/burisequki.coffee to update my nav while scrolling on my one-pager located at http://creativecraft.org/ but while the browser is full screen, I can't get it to set "Donate" as active nav as It's far down on the screen & only takes up ~half. I'm a scrub and can't figure it out. Anybody got a fix? :)
[14:50:47] <taplar> iirc, most jquery functions that operate on a result set start with something like: if (this.length < 1) return;
[14:51:09] <g2nightmare> noiseeee
[14:51:11] <g2nightmare> then what do i do
[14:51:18] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare:  i give up, what do you WANT to do?
[14:51:24] <g2nightmare> best practice
[14:51:31] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: you've combined two different jquery styles in your example
[14:51:41] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: best practice is be consistent :)
[14:51:52] <g2nightmare> ok
[14:51:59] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: either build the DOM out of html strings, or use $('<someElement>') and append()
[14:52:21] <PlanC> ah ok
[14:52:23] <g2nightmare> then i'll do the former
[14:52:26] <g2nightmare> because i already have that
[14:52:30] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: word
[14:52:36] <g2nightmare> side question, how do i call more than one function in document.ready?
[14:52:51] <g2nightmare> in lines 1-4 i call a create function but after that I need to do something else
[14:52:52] <PlanC> taplar: that's good, but it's much slower than document.getElementById
[14:53:09] <taplar> huh?
[14:53:10] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  I would guess that maybe he's looking to separate the markup from his logic?
[14:53:27] <LindsayMac> NoiseEee:  like maybe make a "template" function of some sort?
[14:53:30] <taplar> $('#something') translates into document.getElementById('something')
[14:53:53] <PlanC> taplar: it does, but as you said there is additional code before
[14:54:09] <taplar> *shrug* not enough to cause a noticable difference
[14:54:19] <PlanC> https://jsperf.com/document-getelementbyid-vs-jquery/3
[14:54:29] <LindsayMac> g2nightmare:  just call your funciton after your first one...
[14:55:07] <g2nightmare> how
[14:55:09] <g2nightmare> syntactically
[14:55:12] <LindsayMac> g2nightmare:  so if you have a new function you want to run after your $.get() you can just add it after that line.. However, if that new function needs data from the first function you need to do soemthing different. It all depends on what your second function is meant to do
[14:55:13] <g2nightmare> oh
[14:55:14] <g2nightmare> nevermind
[14:55:33] <g2nightmare> i need the data from the config
[14:55:43] <g2nightmare> so do i need to do a second get? or maybe a function that just returns the data from the config
[14:56:07] <PlanC> taplar: not noticeable, but in the time that 2.3 billion document.getElemebyByIds finished, only 3 million #('foo')s completed
[14:56:17] <LindsayMac> g2nightmare: you need to run another function that does something with the data you have already gotten and assigned to variables in createCalendar?
[14:56:18] <taplar> so?
[14:56:38] <LindsayMac> PlanC:  how are you testing this?
[14:56:38] <PlanC> it's faster, that's it, haha
[14:56:41] <taplar> your over optimizing your code
[14:56:46] <PlanC> https://jsperf.com/document-getelementbyid-vs-jquery/3
[14:56:46] <g2nightmare> LindsayMac the config file returns 3 useful things, two of which i use for one function and one for the other
[14:56:48] <PlanC> yeah, I know
[14:56:54] <PlanC> just talking about this because it's interesting
[14:57:02] <PlanC> LindsayMac: benchmark from the link I provided
[14:57:10] <LindsayMac> g2nightmare: like i said.. it all really depends in what your second function has to do
[14:57:14] <NoiseEee> well when you come across a DOM with 1,000,000 things to go through ,let me know PlanC
[14:57:16] <taplar> of course something that uses a framework will be slower than direct access
[14:57:37] <PlanC> NoiseEEE: will do, haha
[14:57:53] <g2nightmare> LindsayMac: does this look acceptable https://dpaste.de/AFT9
[14:57:53] <NoiseEee> (it's important to consider the 'real world' when doing metrics)
[14:58:15] <LindsayMac> PlanC:  programming is a bit of an art.. you have to decide what type of efficiency you need for what you're writing
[14:58:30] <LindsayMac> g2nightmare:  no idea what i'm looking at here
[14:59:07] <g2nightmare> idk i just think im doing it wrong because i'm not using jquery
[14:59:15] <g2nightmare> im building a string and then setting it
[14:59:16] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: you ARE using jquery
[14:59:17] <taplar> g2nightmare: fwiw if you want to get around the manual concatenation, you could keep an array and push to it your strings, and at the end .join('') it
[14:59:19] <NoiseEee> chrust
[14:59:19] <g2nightmare> do normal devs do that?
[14:59:37] <PlanC> LindsayMac: exactly
[14:59:37] <LindsayMac> g2nightmare: what does this have to do with your second function?
[14:59:39] <taplar> i usually build objects, but that's my style
[14:59:50] <g2nightmare> taplar: that's what noise said but i guess thats normal style?
[14:59:56] <g2nightmare> lindsay: it doesnt im not there yet
[14:59:59] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: if you weren't using jquery, you wouldn't be able to insert DOM elements via a string
[15:00:00] <taplar> 'normal' is relative
[15:00:16] <LindsayMac> g2nightmare: everyone has different programming styles...
[15:00:17] <taplar> if it works and makes sense, just do you! :)
[15:00:35] <LindsayMac> g2nightmare:  but you should really take the time to understand what jQuery actually is
[15:00:53] <g2nightmare> aka im doing itw rong
[15:01:11] <LindsayMac> g2nightmare:  no.. you're TALKING about it all wrong
[15:01:30] <LindsayMac> g2nightmare:  you dont know what questions to ask and therefore you can't understand what the answers are that are being given
[15:01:51] <LindsayMac> g2nightmare:  That is the problem here. Its not your code.. it's you/
[15:02:26] <taplar> not to say your not a great person
[15:02:29] <taplar> lol
[15:02:45] <taplar> sorry, felt like it got a little realz, ;)
[15:02:49] <LindsayMac> lol
[15:04:44] <LindsayMac> lunch time
[15:05:38] <g2nightmare> if i were to first do var $calendar = $("<table>", {class: "calendar"});
[15:05:45] <g2nightmare> is this syntactically right
[15:05:45] <g2nightmare> $calendar.add($("<tr>")).add($("<th></th>"));
[15:05:59] <taplar> no, that would append the th to the calendar
[15:06:21] <taplar> not sure if add() is correct.  append() is valid though
[15:06:27] <g2nightmare> someone said to use add
[15:06:32] <taplar> lets see
[15:07:16] <taplar> oh
[15:07:17] <LindsayMac> g2nightmare:  if you have a question about some code someone gave you.. or just ion general someone gives you code that works but you don't understand, GOOGLE IT!
[15:07:23] <taplar> add is kinda like a concat
[15:07:26] <g2nightmare> i wrote that code?
[15:07:29] <LindsayMac> g2nightmare:  https://api.jquery.com/add/
[15:07:32] <taplar> but in the case of the th, your wanting to append it to the tr
[15:07:38] <LindsayMac> g2nightmare:  was that a question or a statement
[15:07:47] <g2nightmare> statement with confusion
[15:08:15] <LindsayMac> g2nightmare: ummm... either you wrote the code or you didnt. thats the LEAST thing you shoudl be confused about
[15:08:36] <g2nightmare> statement, but confused on why you suggested that someone gave me that and i didnt understand it
[15:08:40] <LindsayMac> g2nightmare:  but you said someone told you that you should use .add().. so while you might have physically wrote it, someone told you do.. you should understand why
[15:09:20] <g2nightmare> taplar: so i need to append to the parent div each time?
[15:09:28] <taplar> hold on...
[15:09:45] <g2nightmare> so i need to make a <table></table> and then append BETWEEN?
[15:10:02] <taplar> um, between is the wrong adjative
[15:10:07] <taplar> think of parents and children
[15:10:16] <taplar> appending to an element is adding children
[15:10:23] <g2nightmare> well when i create a <table> is it just creating <table> or <table></table>
[15:10:28] <g2nightmare> so the latter
[15:10:30] <g2nightmare> if its a child
[15:10:35] <taplar> it's creating an object
[15:10:41] <taplar> a dom node
[15:10:58] <g2nightmare> what's the difference between <table> and <table/>
[15:11:01] <g2nightmare> when i make the node?
[15:11:06] <taplar> nothing
[15:11:41] <LindsayMac> g2nightmare:  what is a node? http://javascript.info/tutorial/dom-nodes
[15:11:48] <Log1x> I'm using http://hastebin.com/burisequki.coffee to update my nav while scrolling on my one-pager located at http://creativecraft.org/ but while the browser is full screen, I can't get it to set "Donate" as active nav as It's far down on the screen & only takes up ~half. I'm a scrub and can't figure it out. Anybody got a fix? :)
[15:11:50] <g2nightmare> im familiar with a node
[15:11:55] <g2nightmare> what i dont understand is jquery
[15:11:58] <g2nightmare> web programming is bullshit
[15:12:01] <LindsayMac> g2nightmare: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9979172/difference-between-node-object-and-element-object
[15:12:14] <LindsayMac> g2nightmare: you have no idea what you're talking about!
[15:12:16] <taplar> jquery is simply a library for manipulating the dom
[15:12:24] <g2nightmare> yes i understand that
[15:12:29] <g2nightmare> but what i dont understand is how jquery even helps me
[15:12:38] <g2nightmare> because it was just as simple as creating a string and setting html
[15:12:47] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: okay, how would you go about creating elements in vanilla JS?
[15:12:52] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: no, you cannot do it via a string
[15:12:54] <taplar> jquery abstracts away a lot of the different ways different browsers accomplish results
[15:12:59] <g2nightmare> create a string and set innerhtml
[15:13:03] <LindsayMac> Log1x:  make "donate" active when the bottom of the donate container is at the bottom of the window for that case
[15:13:04] <taplar> and also common boiler plate apps usually write over and over
[15:13:12] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: nope, not gonna ger proper DOM elements that way
[15:13:22] <shoky_> also strings don't have innerhtml ;p
[15:13:34] <NoiseEee> g2nightmare: and writing HTML via .innerHTML won't really work out
[15:14:20] <LindsayMac> Log1x:  the issue is that the donate container is never reaching the top of the window on larger screens because it's not tall enough
[15:14:39] <taplar> g2nightmare: here's a small example of one way to do the object creation method http://jsfiddle.net/dba9tmL4/
[15:14:41] <g2nightmare> can i call an .append on a jquery variable?
[15:14:55] <shoky_> you can _only_ call .append on a jquery object
[15:15:07] <LindsayMac> g2nightmare: .append() is onyl for jquery
[15:16:13] <g2nightmare> why do you append tr after ?
[15:16:26] <LindsayMac> after what?
[15:16:27] <taplar> if i didn't it would not be a child of the table
[15:17:19] <LindsayMac> ahh didnt see the fiddle
[15:17:43] <g2nightmare> hold on
[15:18:29] <PlanC> is there a line that I can add to a script src tag which forces the browser to reload it?
[15:18:42] <taplar> PlanC: you dont' want it to cache?
[15:18:46] <PlanC> taplar: yeah
[15:18:46] <LindsayMac> PlanC:  like a cache buster?
[15:18:50] <PlanC> I think I just found a solution
[15:18:55] <PlanC> I could add a parameter, right?
[15:18:57] <taplar> PlanC: you can append a random parameter to it
[15:18:58] <LindsayMac> PlanC:  append the date to the file url as a param
[15:19:02] <taplar> ^
[15:19:07] <PlanC> perfect
[15:19:08] <PlanC> thanks

[15:19:49] <taplar> that would work for if you want to force it to reload when the version changes
[15:19:50] <LindsayMac> PlanC:  typically people use a date or time for auto-cache busting but I like versions for live sites.. time/date for dev
[15:20:18] <LindsayMac> because time/date will change and force a reload every time I load the page.. so its good for dev
[15:20:38] <taplar> LindsayMac: depending on browser the dev tools can disable caching
[15:20:51] <g2nightmare> taplar: https://dpaste.de/cm0E
[15:21:00] <g2nightmare> i wrote the jquery equivalent under the string buildign lines
[15:21:06] <g2nightmare> does it look correct?
[15:21:10] <LindsayMac> taplar:  yea... i mean if i AM going to force it via param thats how I do it..
[15:21:15] <Log1x> LindsayMac: Have an example on how to fix it? D: I tried doing an if statement with the current position at the bottom and to just always set that to donate but still failed. D:
[15:21:42] <PlanC> I've seen ad companies use random numbers for their tags
[15:21:52] <LindsayMac> Log1x:  can I see your code again?
[15:21:57] <taplar> g2nightmare: looks valid
[15:22:02] <PlanC> that way they can reload them each time and avoid serving an old ad due to a cache
[15:22:06] <Log1x> http://hastebin.com/burisequki.coffee
[15:22:07] <g2nightmare> why is line 6 the way it is?
[15:22:21] <g2nightmare> oh nevermind
[15:22:24] <g2nightmare> dumb question
[15:23:06] <g2nightmare> im going to write the rest, one sec
[15:23:08] <PlanC> Log1x: is hastebin your site?
[15:23:20] <Log1x> nah
[15:24:10] <PlanC> first time I see it used and the Alexa seems pretty new too
[15:24:14] <PlanC> how did you find it?
[15:24:17] <LindsayMac> Log1x: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4653911/jquery-detecting-if-the-bottom-of-the-div-is-touching-the-bottom-of-the-browse
[15:24:25] <LindsayMac> PlanC:  its a pretty commonly used paste site
[15:24:31] <Log1x> its popular among a lot of java dev's i know (not javascript)
[15:25:36] <PlanC> ah ok
[15:26:09] <shoky_> it's popular among js devs too ;p
[15:26:44] <g2nightmare> taplar: https://dpaste.de/jorx
[15:26:44] <PlanC> had no idea
[15:26:46] <g2nightmare> i think i did it
[15:27:42] <taplar> looks valid
[15:27:54] <g2nightmare> thanks for your example
[15:28:00] <taplar> np
[15:33:08] <pohvak> hello, somebody here? i got a question
[15:35:23] <shoky_> ask
[15:37:40] <pohvak> i'm populating a 'select' dinamically using $("#s").html(), then i need to change the selected value also dinamically using $("#s").val("desiredValue"), it works fine when the 'select' was filled in HTML, but when i filled via javascript with html() it doesnt work
[15:38:39] <shoky_> make a jsfiddle showing the problem
[15:38:59] <pohvak> k wait
[15:41:49] <Log1x> LindsayMac: Got it to work. ^_^ Thanks
[15:55:56] <rindolf> Hi all. Sup?
[15:59:14] <hydraidm801> I want to replace all the full days with one div but I am getting 1 div per child node? https://jsfiddle.net/fubvxrbz/
[15:59:27] <rindolf> hydraidm801: let me see.
[16:01:57] <rindolf> hydraidm801: doesn't .children() return a list?
[16:02:16] <rindolf> hydraidm801: you can try using .html(...) instead.
[16:02:24] <hydraidm801> k I'll try that
[16:02:31] <pohvak> shoky_ i did a jsfiddle but it works in there Â¬Â¬ but on my site dont :S
[16:02:50] <hydraidm801> rindolf, oh I need to keep the date number thats why I didn't use .html()
[16:03:21] <rindolf> hydraidm801: why not put it inside the .html ( ... )?
[16:03:42] <taplar> hydraidm801: you can also do -> $(this).empty().append('<div class="unavail-block"></div>');
[16:04:11] <pohvak> shoky_ i did a jsfiddle but it works in there Â¬Â¬ but on my site dont :S https://jsfiddle.net/ssL4nvzo/3/
[16:04:21] <taplar> or $(this).html() like rindolf suggested
[16:05:24] <hydraidm801> but how do I get the date number?
[16:05:43] <pohvak> sorry shoky_ wrong url before this is the correct https://jsfiddle.net/ssL4nvzo/6/
[16:07:26] <taplar> hydraidm801: https://jsfiddle.net/fubvxrbz/1/
[16:07:39] <taplar> i stored it as a prop on the element in the find
[16:08:28] <taplar> in the second part you don't have to re-wrap the this as your adding them to the array as jquery objects already
[16:08:47] <anli> Is it possible to modify css rules an re-layout the document?
[16:09:04] <rindolf> anli: I think so.
[16:09:20] <duch_kazatel> anli you mean like edit css files?
[16:09:50] <anli> Maybe to use another href
[16:10:14] <duch_kazatel> you could do that, sure, though it'll be a little awkward.
[16:10:56] <Duvdevan> anyone used this plugin?=
[16:10:58] <Duvdevan> https://github.com/PragmaticMates/jquery-final-countdown
[16:11:10] <Duvdevan> what should I pass into start/end/now parameters?
[16:11:17] <Duvdevan> timestamp... or?
[16:12:00] <duch_kazatel> looks like it takes epoch timestamps.
[16:12:09] <Duvdevan> how to get those in js
[16:12:19] <duch_kazatel> the Date() constructor
[16:12:20] <Duvdevan> and how to determine + 5-10 days from now()
[16:12:32] <duch_kazatel> the Date() constructor.  or use moment.js
[16:12:38] <duch_kazatel> moment will make your life a LOT easier.
[16:13:04] <Duvdevan> let me see
[16:13:06] <hydraidm801> taplar, oh sweet, thanks
[16:13:33] <Duvdevan> would it work for this silly plugin
[16:13:56] <duch_kazatel> Duvdevan you just need the current unix epoch timestamp thinger.
[16:14:00] <duch_kazatel> you could use moment to grab that.
[16:14:06] <duch_kazatel> or learn how to do it manually.
[16:15:17] <Duvdevan> Unix ms timestamp ?
[16:15:35] <duch_kazatel> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time
[16:15:35] <duch_kazatel> this.
[16:15:48] <shoky_> pohvak: welp, can't help without seeing the issue :S
[16:16:10] <Duvdevan> shoky matok
[16:16:28] <shoky_> pohvak: but.. that's a really gross way of adding elements..
[16:16:39] <shoky_> hiyo Duvdevani
[16:16:48] <shoky_> got your keyboard at my side
[16:17:07] <pohvak> shoky_ take a look at refriauto.com.mx/2015 search there for Honda - Civic - 2012 then look at the "Fabricante" select in the new page
[16:17:49] <pohvak> i wrote $("#s").val() to change the selected element, it works on jsdiffle but not there
[16:19:01] <shoky_> pohvak: umm how do i do the search
[16:19:04] <anli> Is there some ordered list in c# that uses Comparable interface?
[16:19:14] <anli> Or what the name of such an interface can be
[16:19:27] <anli> Maybe I should do some research
[16:19:32] <shoky_> anli: wrong channel
[16:19:37] <duch_kazatel> anli lol asking in #jquery about c# info.
[16:19:43] <anli> haha
[16:19:48] <anli> Sorry
[16:20:17] <anli> I wrote in the wrong window, of course
[16:20:36] <anli> The 2nd error was that I did not do the required googling
[16:20:49] <duch_kazatel> JERK
[16:20:50] <duch_kazatel> D:
[16:21:22] <pohvak> shoky_ http://tinypic.com/r/16m0qc2/8
[16:21:49] <shoky_> pohvak: yeah i chose those, then .. clicking that big red button doesn't do anything
[16:21:59] <anli> pohvak: An almost ad free page
[16:22:07] <pohvak> anli LOL
[16:22:09] <shoky_> pohvak: oh maybe it's trying to open a popup
[16:22:18] <shoky_> do i have to let it? :\
[16:22:27] <anli> My computer is still trying to open popups from visiting that page
[16:23:43] <shoky_> pohvak: well the popup has an error, and so the rest of the js code there doesn't run
[16:24:06] <shoky_> pohvak: Cannot read property 'resultado' of null    coming from this line-   var resultadoDeBusqueda = window.opener.resultado;
[16:24:54] <shoky_> maybe it's cause i didnt let it open the popups at first? mm
[16:25:49] <pohvak> shoky_ that error was already fixed, wait i will call the results page without a popup i will give you a new link
[16:26:21] <shoky_> pohvak: managed to open it normally and it doesnt error now
[16:27:36] <pohvak> shoky_ there you see a select wich reads "FABRICANTE" right? there i load data, but i need to automatically select there the same "fabricante" wich was selected in the previous window
[16:28:04] <pohvak> shoky_ "fabricante" is manufacturer in spanish
[16:28:28] <pohvak> whats the best way to preserve the data previously selected?
[16:28:34] <shoky_> pohvak: you're setting the value  before inserting the contents into the <select>
[16:28:37] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  wanted to tell you that I feel like a freaking idiot....
[16:28:45] <pohvak> no, im pretty sure not
[16:28:51] <shoky_> pohvak: the .val("14")  runs before the getJSON callback runs
[16:28:54] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  and that your code WAS what I wanted mostly
[16:29:20] <shoky_> pohvak: .val("14")  runs on page load.  the getJSON callback runs when the json request finishes
[16:29:22] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac so you figured it out?
[16:29:35] <shoky_> pohvak:  put the .val("14")  inside the getJSON callback and it will work
[16:29:36] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  well not quite yet but almost there.
[16:29:40] <pohvak> shoky_ LOL sorry about this, i get it now
[16:29:45] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  I just realized how much of a dunce i was being
[16:29:52] <pohvak> shoky_ will work on that thank you men
[16:30:02] <shoky_> pohvak: no worries, it's a common mistake
[16:30:28] <pohvak> shoky_ will work on that thank you man, im embarrased LOL
[16:30:47] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac overcomplicating it? :)
[16:31:20] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: I was just not seeing a part of the code that you had given me and the whole time I was thinking you were missing a point that you werent at all..
[16:32:15] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac hahaha which part?
[16:32:36] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  the part where i wanted each url grouped with it's "nonUser" record...
[16:32:47] <duch_kazatel> aaaah :)
[16:32:49] <duch_kazatel> yeah....
[16:32:49] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: I wasn't reading the output of the console.log correctly on your last one
[16:32:58] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaaaah
[16:33:24] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  so now all I have to do is work out how to separate that list of urls instead of outputting it as a single comma separated list of all values and I should be good.. and I think i might know where to go now
[16:33:37] <duch_kazatel> awesome!  glad to hear.
[16:33:52] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  don't party JUST yet lol... still trudging through the code ha
[16:41:12] <`ULT> Hi, should I add the  jQuery user interface library for some little effects on my website or is it to mutch?
[16:41:35] <LindsayMac> `ULT: depends on what you need and what lighterweight options are out there
[16:41:51] <`ULT> For now I use it only for animating my add and hide class
[16:42:22] <shoky_> `ULT for "some little effects" you should most probably go for css solutions. unless you gotta support IE8 or somecrap...
[16:42:25] <LindsayMac> `ULT: why do you feel the need to include jquery UI for animation???
[16:43:08] <`ULT> I need this, but think it is overkill to add that library
[16:43:10] <`ULT> http://api.jqueryui.com/removeclass/
[16:43:12] <shoky_> `ULT learn css transitions, to start with
[16:43:17] <`ULT> good point
[16:43:37] <acidjazz> you can go one step further w/ .removeTeacher() or even .removeEducation()
[16:43:38] <shoky_> then all you need is a simple .addClass or .removeClass
[16:43:46] <shoky_> not the jquery-ui crap
[16:43:52] <LindsayMac> `ULT: my questionw as why do you THINK you need that?
[16:44:37] <`ULT> Will see what I can do with the css transitions
[16:44:54] <`ULT> Dont have experience with it. But think it is cool to try something with it.
[16:45:20] <`ULT> you dont think I need that LindsayMac?
[16:45:20] <shoky_> with jquery-ui addClass effects?
[16:45:26] <shoky_> no, it's not cool to try something with it
[16:45:35] <shoky_> unless you know it's the thing you need ;)
[16:45:48] <LindsayMac> `ULT: ^ thats why i asked why you think you  need it
[16:45:52] <`ULT> no shoky_ I mean it `s cool to try something with  the css transitions
[16:45:53] <shoky_> it was cool some years ago maybe. today, nope.
[16:46:05] <shoky_> `ULT ah then i completely agree ;D
[16:46:09] <`ULT> :p
[16:46:17] <LindsayMac> `ULT: you're already working with jQuery and some other tools, why do you feel compelled to bring another entire library in?
[16:46:32] <`ULT> I dont think it is a good idea LindsayMac
[16:46:38] <`ULT> that is why I was asking for it :p
[16:46:44] <`ULT> I know its overkill
[16:47:01] <LindsayMac> `ULT: so you knew the answer to your question before you asked it..
[16:47:10] <`ULT> there are no dumb questions
[16:47:17] <`ULT> and I`m learning. So i thougt lets ask
[16:47:27] <`ULT> what your guys thougst are
[16:47:29] <LindsayMac> I beg to disagree.... there's loads of dumb questions.
[16:47:35] <shoky_> also mayube someone else didn't know, and now they do ;p
[16:47:38] <`ULT> Not when your learning
[16:47:53] <taplar> i would hope we're not asking people to not ask questions
[16:48:41] <LindsayMac> taplar:  no.. just trying to understand what brings people to ask questions like this .. that is all. maybe it was the wording that bothered me more than the question.
[16:48:45] <taplar> i would rather the 'dumb' questions be asked rather than possibly miss a good question
[16:49:10] <shoky_> they even asked their question with "or is it to much?".. hardly a bothersome question
[16:49:19] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac you assume that people know what you know.
[16:49:43] <duch_kazatel> or that there's some modicum of info you automatically ascertain the moment you start doing a particular kind of development
[16:49:49] <LindsayMac> Like i said.. i was just trying to understand the idea behind such a question. I wasn't trying to make the person feel bad about asking it.
[16:50:30] <duch_kazatel> sure, and i'm just pointing out some perspective that's often helpful for me ;)
[16:51:05] <LindsayMac> ie: the person already knew it was too much to include a library for such a question so I would have worded it something like "how do I add an animation similar to [this] jquery UI function without including the library" .. but just trying to understand the formation of the question "should i do this even though I know its probably wrong" types
[16:51:21] <`ULT> LindsayMac
[16:51:28] <duch_kazatel> and maybe they weren't sure if they'd made an assumption :)
[16:51:30] <`ULT> I dont know how mutch overkill a new libary is
[16:51:47] <LindsayMac> `ULT:  thats why i asked! not yelling at you for it..
[16:51:48] <`ULT> So I think it is a fair questions. but nvm.
[16:52:00] <duch_kazatel> `ULT you can do a custom build for jsut the parts you want fwiw
[16:52:34] <`ULT> Oke nice duch_kazatel, I didnt know that
[16:52:55] <`ULT> But I will try some stuff with the css transition
[16:53:03] <duch_kazatel> see that "custom download" box on the jqui homepage?
[16:54:22] <`ULT> I see now duch_kazatel, nice.
[16:56:00] <LindsayMac> arg i keep clicking CMD S on jsfiddle
[16:56:26] <`ULT> Another question. I know you do not recommend it. But how bad is including a whole libary for some little effects. It will speed down the site noticeable?
[16:56:40] <duch_kazatel> `ULT it really depends on the library and a few other factors.
[16:57:02] <`ULT> Oke.
[16:57:17] <duch_kazatel> just include jquery ui won't necessarily slow down the page in any meaningful way unless you actually try to make use of it.
[16:57:44] <duch_kazatel> and even then, it's not going to be noticably slower unless you're doing something way weird.
[16:57:54] <`ULT> Aah oke it depents on the functions you are using.
[16:58:06] <LindsayMac> `ULT: and how you're using it.
[16:58:22] <duch_kazatel> yeah.  i mean, js code can be slow to evaluate, but jqui is pretty good about not being slow on load.
[16:58:36] <duch_kazatel> depending on what (and how) you're doing things. it can slow down.
[16:58:37] <`ULT> All right, but in general we can better use css transitions.
[16:58:43] <LindsayMac> `ULT: also jQueryUI can just add a lot of heaving coding (more lines of code than you need) than just a simple css animation
[16:58:45] <duch_kazatel> generally, though, don't prematurely optimize.
[16:59:37] <duch_kazatel> and yes, for most simple transitions and effects and things, css may well be the better choice, depending on the browsers you need to support and some other factors.
[16:59:59] <`ULT> Good point. Browsersupport.
[17:00:21] <`ULT> I think for me to support the modern browsers is enough.
[17:00:29] <`ULT> A effect is just a effect.
[17:00:34] <`ULT> Nothing more.
[17:00:46] <LindsayMac> `ULT:  also if you're already using jQuery you have those animations as well..
[17:00:46] <duch_kazatel> depends on the UX you've created, but yeah.
[17:00:48] <`ULT> *an
[17:01:06] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac not necessarily.  you have the foundation to do them.
[17:01:31] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: yea true.. but thats the same for css3.. you dont just get to type in 'explode' and get the animation you want..
[17:01:48] <LindsayMac> but the tools are there with both css3 OR jQuery.. jQueryUI gives you quick already created animations you can just apply
[17:02:15] <duch_kazatel> right.  jquery on its own does not work that way for a lot of the transitions you get with jqui.
[17:02:38] <`ULT> One another question what is bothering me. How can I test my code accurate on speed. And when do I know what speed is correct for what I am doing.
[17:02:51] <duch_kazatel> when it becomes a problem.
[17:03:03] <`ULT> I think alot of my stuff is way to complex for what is doing. And sometimes maybe slowdown things.
[17:03:15] <duch_kazatel> unless you're doing something crazy, don't worry about performance.
[17:03:19] <taplar> speed testing is more appropriate for load testing
[17:03:21] <`ULT> Oke, that sounds good.
[17:03:45] <LindsayMac> `ULT:  heres a decent article https://css-tricks.com/myth-busting-css-animations-vs-javascript/
[17:04:13] <acidjazz> myth buthting theeetheth animationth
[17:04:20] <`ULT> I have to be careful with loops ands such things I think.
[17:04:26] <`ULT> Thank you LindsayMac
[17:04:38] <duch_kazatel> `ULT don't use loops in the first place ;)
[17:04:40] <duch_kazatel> acidjazz huh?
[17:05:10] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: nothing duch_kathatel
[17:05:26] <`ULT> Haha dont do that duch_kazatel. You told me that before sometimes :p
[17:05:46] <`ULT> * I
[17:06:59] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: i still haven't fully grasped the alternative to a loop...
[17:07:19] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  when you say dont use loops do you mean dont use .each() or dont use any loop like each() or for()
[17:07:28] <`ULT> I need to say that I personaly like this channel alot. Enormously helpful and kind people. Thanks for that.
[17:08:15] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac i mean don't use for
[17:08:25] <duch_kazatel> forEach() is overused, too.
[17:08:47] <duch_kazatel> most of the time people want to map or filter or some or every
[17:08:53] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  so what is the alternative if you need to iterate through a list of things
[17:09:00] <duch_kazatel> that's my argument.
[17:09:05] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  ok so i understand not using it for filtering
[17:09:06] <duch_kazatel> 9/10 you don't actually want to enumerate
[17:09:15] <LindsayMac> I guess i still haven't fully understood map() yet
[17:09:25] <duch_kazatel> map lets you map one format to another.
[17:10:26] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  so if you've already map'ed and you get your newly mapped array via .map() then you can .each() through the results?
[17:10:37] <duch_kazatel> it depends on what you're doing next.
[17:14:46] <duch_kazatel> generally speaking, people overuse for loops.
[17:14:51] <duch_kazatel> that's all i'm saying.
[17:15:30] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  can you use a map function inside of a map if you have nested arrays ;) ?
[17:15:35] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[17:23:49] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  i'm SOO close
[17:27:43] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/ufaoqaak/17/
[17:27:57] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  the only thing I can't quite get right now is why a comma is getting added only on the list of urls
[17:29:22] <duch_kazatel> beacuse you're doing return currentNonUsersFn + currentNonUsersLn + currentUrls;
[17:29:50] <duch_kazatel> currentUrls is an array - trying to concat an array onto a string joins it with commas.
[17:29:51] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  well the commas only exist ing currentUrls ..
[17:30:11] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: ah ok... so i updated the array but its still an array.. I get it now
[17:30:16] <duch_kazatel> you need to .join() the return of that .map() with whatever character you want.
[17:31:30] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  ok so [currentNonUser.firstname].concat(currentUrls).join('');
[17:31:45] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:31:47] <duch_kazatel> no....
[17:32:04] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  lol ok i'm lost again
[17:32:17] <LindsayMac> gotta google .join()
[17:32:17] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ufaoqaak/18/
[17:32:29] <LindsayMac> Ahhhhh ok
[17:32:32] <duch_kazatel> you need to .join() the return of that .map()
[17:32:35] <duch_kazatel> make sense now?
[17:32:47] <LindsayMac> yup.. i still need to google .join(0 now
[17:33:52] <duch_kazatel> that takes an array and creates a string out of it, using whatever char you pass it as the delimited.
[17:33:55] <duch_kazatel> *delimiter
[17:34:32] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: ok i got it.. i think...
[17:35:03] <duch_kazatel> so ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'].join('-'); gives you 'foo-bar-baz';
[17:35:26] <LindsayMac> ok ok.. i get it.. I was, for some reason, thinking of it like a mysql join
[17:36:25] <LindsayMac> so .map updates the array to the new value which is an <img> tag with the url inside of it.. it is still the same array just with slightly altered contents...
[17:36:35] <duch_kazatel> no.
[17:36:39] <duch_kazatel> .map() returns a new array.
[17:36:59] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: Oh ok.. i thought it altered existing... .each() alters existing then?
[17:37:10] <duch_kazatel> .each() doesn't do anything unless you tell it to.
[17:37:26] <shoky> [1,2,3].map(function(value) { return value + 1; });    --->   [2,4,6]
[17:37:29] <shoky> woops
[17:37:41] <shoky> -->   [2,3,4]
[17:37:42] <LindsayMac> 234 you mean ;)
[17:37:46] <LindsayMac> I got the gist
[17:37:46] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:37:53] <duch_kazatel> but that's a full new array, not the same one.
[17:37:56] <duch_kazatel> also: don't mutate data.
[17:38:05] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  what do you mean don't mutate data?
[17:38:13] <duch_kazatel> don't modify the original array.
[17:39:18] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: ok...
[17:39:35] <duch_kazatel> pull out the data you need and work against that instead.
[17:40:31] <LindsayMac> ok that makes sense
[17:43:24] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  so if I wanted to make some sort of template function so I can pull the markup out of that messy .map() function can I just reference the template function name with the data as an arg for that function instead of doing a returncurrentNonUsersFn + currentNonUsersLn + currentUrls; ?
[17:43:37] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[17:43:41] <LindsayMac> Cool..
[17:44:13] <LindsayMac> so instead of the return I could do responseTemplate(returncurrentNonUsersFn, currentNonUsersLn, currentUrls);
[17:44:35] <duch_kazatel> err.
[17:44:48] <duch_kazatel> so don't ever do that in a map.
[17:45:13] <duch_kazatel> the map's job is to return data into a new array.
[17:45:24] <LindsayMac> No outside of the map..
[17:45:30] <duch_kazatel> then show me.
[17:45:43] <LindsayMac> gimme a few.. need a bathroom break and then I will get on it
[18:14:12] <acidjazz> LindsayMac: YOU SHALL NOT POTTY
[18:15:44] <duch_kazatel> that's... kind of weird.
[18:18:23] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: ok...
[18:19:24] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  so what i was thinking is NOT possible.. not with this setup anyways.
[18:20:23] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  what i was thinking is going to definitely require some kind of loop
[18:21:33] <LindsayMac> because while creating the new array with the new content is nice and useful, its not modular the way I was thinking it was... so I have this new little object which is the result of currentNonUsersFn + currentNonUsersLn + currentUrls for each record in my nonUsers array...
[18:22:38] <LindsayMac> but really what I think I want is some variable data that i can plug into a function and format the view template
[18:24:48] <duch_kazatel> i usually abuse .map() with a templating function and a .join()
[18:25:05] <LindsayMac> a templating function?
[18:25:17] <duch_kazatel> like underscore's _.template()
[18:25:29] <duch_kazatel> returns a string with your values in it.
[18:25:39] <duch_kazatel> you could do something very similar here.
[18:25:47] <LindsayMac> Ahh... yea. i dont have an actual templating engine to use unfortunately.
[18:26:00] <LindsayMac> but was thinking that I wouldnt need one if I could pass the values as args to a function..
[18:26:02] <duch_kazatel> that's fine - make your own function.
[18:26:04] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[18:26:30] <LindsayMac> the thing is that I dont know how to make the values to send to the function. iw old know what to do with them once i have them
[18:26:43] <duch_kazatel> show me what you have now.
[18:27:04] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  i'm back to square 1 with the working map
[18:27:10] <duch_kazatel> no you're not.
[18:27:13] <duch_kazatel> you're conflating things.
[18:27:23] <LindsayMac> http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/ufaoqaak/17/
[18:28:10] <duch_kazatel> right, so, you want nonUsersObj to instead have some templating action, instead of the array you have now, right?
[18:29:10] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  yea i guess that sounds right.
[18:29:22] <duch_kazatel> yeah, easy.
[18:29:36] <duch_kazatel> so pass those three objects to a function that then returns the html you want.
[18:29:45] <duch_kazatel> then .append(nonUsers.join(''));
[18:30:26] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: thats kind of what I initially was saying..
[18:30:45] <LindsayMac> oh wait.. no..
[18:35:37] <LindsayMac> so duch_kazatel, I know this is "wrong" because the variables are all over the place and the scope isn't right.. buyt this was in my head http://hastebin.com/pekiqocima.xml
[18:35:42] <LindsayMac> like i said, i know it's wrong
[18:39:19] <duch_kazatel> sorry, one sec.
[18:48:32] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  omg
[18:48:35] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  i think i got it
[18:48:55] <LindsayMac> nope but almost
[18:49:15] <LindsayMac> fookin' ell
[18:49:21] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[18:50:06] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ufaoqaak/22/
[18:50:09] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  i got it
[18:50:12] <duch_kazatel> for a gross oversimplification of the idea.
[18:51:33] <LindsayMac> http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/ufaoqaak/23/
[18:51:42] <duch_kazatel> no.
[18:51:51] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  mine is a bit different
[18:52:02] <duch_kazatel> yours is very different and exactly what i'd avoid.
[18:52:09] <duch_kazatel> :)
[18:52:14] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  ahh i see how you did it though. you returned the function. That is where I was failing with the way you did it. I wasn't returning the function.
[18:52:26] <duch_kazatel> *the result of the function.
[18:52:34] <duch_kazatel> "returning a function" is a very different thing.
[18:52:57] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  but your code you're retuning a funciton AND the result of it
[18:53:01] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[18:53:06] <duch_kazatel> it's returning the result of the function.
[18:53:12] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: you do return in getFormattedUserData and return myfunct(); etc
[18:53:21] <duch_kazatel> that's not returning a function,
[18:53:21] <LindsayMac> return getFormattedUserData(currentNonUsersFn, currentNonUsersLn, currentUrls); doesn't return the function?
[18:53:25] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[18:53:30] <duch_kazatel> it returns wahtever that function call returns.
[18:53:31] <duch_kazatel> which is a string.
[18:53:45] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  so why do you also need to do return inside the function
[18:53:55] <LindsayMac> and what is to be avoided with my format?
[18:53:56] <duch_kazatel> ... because how would taht data get where it needs to go?
[18:54:01] <duch_kazatel> i'm building an array of strings.
[18:54:10] <duch_kazatel> before it was returning objects.
[18:54:55] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  so why do you also have to do return theFunciton(); ? why can't you just call the funciton and have it run since it's returning it's values anyways?
[18:55:07] <duch_kazatel> because it's returning them to the calling function.
[18:55:15] <duch_kazatel> give it a shot and see what happens,.'
[18:55:27] <duch_kazatel> getFormattedUserData returns a string.
[18:55:29] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  so what is "wrong" about mine
[18:55:30] <LindsayMac> ?
[18:55:32] <LindsayMac> just so I know
[18:55:52] <duch_kazatel> no need to use $.each() - you're awkwardly building up strings when you could to the exact same thing with arrays instead.
[18:56:03] <duch_kazatel> you want to map your data from one format to another.
[18:56:27] <LindsayMac> but why? what is the benefit?
[18:56:48] <duch_kazatel> maintainability. readability.
[18:57:01] <duch_kazatel> letting the language handle the hard parts for you.
[18:57:59] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: its funny because I consider mine more "readable" than yours ...
[18:58:05] <duch_kazatel> i don't.
[18:58:40] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  understood....
[18:58:43] <duch_kazatel> also: now you're introducing a side effect into the map.
[18:58:49] <LindsayMac> a side effect?
[18:58:51] <duch_kazatel> map is meant to return a new array.
[18:58:59] <duch_kazatel> you're having the map ultimately append html.
[18:59:11] <duch_kazatel> i have a meeting.  google side effects :)
[19:46:47] <lenswipee> Hi, please consider: <div><insert/><foo/><bar/><baz/></div>. How do I insert <insert/> within <div> but as first sibling?
[19:47:44] <lenswipee> I tried append() but that adds as last sibling.
[19:50:57] <jquery325> hi friends
[19:51:34] <jquery325> sup sky
[19:55:29] <shoky_> lenswipee: prepend
[19:56:41] <lenswipee> shoky_: I just tried that and got a very weird result
[19:57:16] <shoky_> k
[19:57:22] <jquery578> I'm having trouble getting 2 sets of checkboxes to append to a div separately  both rows of checkboxes are adding together http://jsfiddle.net/dfzrt3qt/1/
[20:01:45] <lenswipee> shoky_: does prepend push elements down or over writes first sibling?
[20:03:26] <LindsayMac> arg i really really hate feeling this useless with JS data
[20:03:34] <LindsayMac> there are too many options for storing data
[20:07:05] <LindsayMac> I can't decide if I should change this: "images" : {"5510":5510,"5513":5513} } to "images": [ "5510", "5513" ]
[20:07:40] <jquery325> why not both
[20:07:50] <jquery325> jk, dont listen to me
[20:11:07] <LindsayMac> ummm ok
[20:12:32] <shoky_> LindsayMac you probably should.. unless there's a reason for that redundancy
[20:12:54] <LindsayMac> shoky_: i should what?
[20:12:56] <shoky_> lenswipee: it adds an element as first element of the container
[20:13:10] <shoky_> LindsayMac: change that images object
[20:13:20] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  change it to an array?
[20:13:33] <LindsayMac> shoky_: instead of an object {"5510":5510,"5513":5513}
[20:13:55] <shoky_> yah
[20:14:45] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  what is your reasoning?
[20:15:17] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  can't I just do JSON.stringify() do it>
[20:15:20] <shoky_> for brevity's sake.. readability,  occam's razor, etc
[20:15:26] <shoky_> huh?
[20:15:27] <LindsayMac> I mean JSON.parese
[20:15:43] <shoky_> what does that have to do with how the data is structured?
[20:16:33] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  well it's either stored as an object or an array.. if it;s stored as an object I can easily turn it into an array with JSON.parse() on the front end if needed, right?
[20:17:31] <shoky_> JSON.parse  turns a string of json into a js value
[20:17:51] <shoky_> it doesn't change the data or turn objects into arrays..
[20:18:45] <LindsayMac> Ah ok.
[20:19:09] <LindsayMac> hmm,.. probably should just store it as an array since I am formatting my urls as an array as well
[20:21:04] <shoky_> [ "5510", "5513" ]   looks nicer and cleaner than  {"5510":5510,"5513":5513} }
[20:21:11] <shoky_> that's good enough reason for me ;p
[20:22:25] <LindsayMac> agreed
[20:25:24] <acidjazz> I AGREE IM A BRACKET PERSON
[20:25:30] <acidjazz> BRACKETS AND CAPS
[20:26:37] * shoky_ throws acidjazz a penny
[20:28:17] <LindsayMac> ok ineed a break for  now.. thanks for your help all.
[20:47:17] <pohvak> shoky_ you still around here?
[21:03:40] <shoky_> pohvak ye
[21:04:24] <pohvak> shoky_ nothing, i saw it was another kindergarden mistake from me LOL i got like 1 hour with a bug but finally found it
[21:05:04] <shoky_> lol
[21:51:45] <YokoBR> hi guys, i need to create a function to return false when i click on this div -> http://pastebin.com/5NXt3PKn
[21:51:53] <YokoBR> like a jquery event
[21:51:57] <YokoBR> the other ones works
[21:52:41] <YokoBR> like  $("#save").click(function() {                     savenumber();                 });
[22:03:39] <shoky_> huh?
[22:13:46] <YokoBR> shoky_: i need to prevent this div from being loaded
