[02:42:51] <lilltiger> Have the $('#id').trigger('change'); and $('#id').trigger('input'); stop working for input boxes recently?
[05:24:12] <crs> Hi there, I am passing a string to my script, say it's received in script as foo, how could I construct an object with key of value of that variable? I want to do something like var foo = $(el).data(foo); data={ foo: somevalue },  but I am getting literal foo, rather than what tha var holds.
[15:50:00] <shoky> crs: mm it's been like 10 hours since you asked, but do you maybe still need help with that? :p
[15:51:13] <shoky> in any case you could always do   data={}; data[foo] = somevalue;    or in modern js you can just  data = {[foo]: somevalue};
[17:36:24] <crs> shoky: Thanks! I have changed all endpoints to use the same name there, lol. :)
[17:36:54] <crs> shoky: also [variable] works.
