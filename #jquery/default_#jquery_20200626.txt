[04:58:02] <Voxel> Hence, the question. Might anyone know if it's possible to achieve something like this as the code I wrote, but with less code? https://3v4l.org/ch02N At least, it looks like thew "addToArray" function might be optimized for sure ...
[04:59:02] <Voxel> The main purpose is to add into array a value with creating keys if such do not exists recursively
[04:59:29] <robertmaxrees> Hi Voxel!  Youy want ##javascript :)
[04:59:46] <Voxel> Oh, sorry. Wrong channel.
[04:59:50] <Voxel> ##php should be
[04:59:53] <robertmaxrees> :)
[04:59:59] <robertmaxrees> ah, there you go!!
[05:00:09] <Voxel> How did I get there?
[05:00:10] <Voxel> here*
[05:14:28] <Voxel> Although, <3 jQuery ...
[05:14:37] <Voxel> Why do people complain about it?
[05:22:18] <Voxel> They say aka "You don't need the jQuery ..." blah blah )
[05:23:26] <Voxel> Why so? I mean, it highly minimizes the code
[05:29:55] <Cork> Voxel: jquery came about when we had 4 js/rendering engines, one followed the spec (opera), one was fairly close (gecko), one was ok with the engine but quite a bit away for rendering (webkit) and one that didn't care about the spec at all (trident)
[05:31:07] <Cork> since then trident has been dropped for endge, and finally dropped completely, opera is dropped, and webkit has been forked to blink
[05:31:22] <Cork> so ya, the platform is a lot more streamlined then back then
[05:32:10] <Cork> jquery still provided a way to make dom manipulation more streamlined, but it isn't "needed" in the way it was 10+ years ago
[05:34:43] <Cork> opps endge is supposed to be edge
[05:37:09] <Voxel> And the opps is supposed to the oops :D?
[05:37:26] <Voxel> Sorry, bu I did not understand you statement
[05:37:27] <Cork> lol
[05:37:57] <Cork> you mean the last line or all of it?
[05:38:52] <Voxel> I mean, for example, $('#some > selected:not(wat)') is much more shorter than the equevalent in JS
[05:39:06] <Voxel> And $.ajax and such
[05:40:47] <Cork> $('#some > .selected:not(.wat)') => document.querySelectorAll('#some > .selected:not(.wat)')
[05:40:56] <Cork> and in modern browsers there is fetch()
[05:41:33] <Cork> querySelectorAll is longer then $() but it gives a very similar effect, and it has been around for a long time
[05:41:50] <Cork> you still have to if(result == null) wrap the result though
[05:42:22] <Cork> as for fetch it is fairly new so you will have to make sure you don't need the old support (ie12 i think)
[05:42:50] <Voxel> Why did they call it fetch?
[05:42:54] <Voxel> Makes no sense to me
[05:43:23] <Cork> (nope it was in edge ms added it)
[05:43:38] <Cork> you would have to ask the whatwg about the name, no cluse
[05:43:46] <Cork> https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/
[05:45:18] <Cork> ajax is a wrapper about XMLHttpRequest with some hacks from the ie5 times
[05:45:34] <Cork> so ya, it is quite old
[05:47:21] <Voxel> Is that good?
[05:47:38] <Cork> is what good?
[05:47:47] <Voxel> XMLHttpRequest?
[05:48:02] <Cork> it was the only alternative to form posts in iframes before fetch
[05:48:23] <Voxel> Also, it's async for most times
[05:48:37] <Cork> well except for ie specific XDomain (that was added in ie10 time to support cross domain XMLHttpRequest calls)
[05:49:23] <Cork> fetch is always async and xmlhttprequest is async or sync depending on how you call it
[05:50:14] <Cork> (and the sync format is depricated)
[05:52:12] <Voxel> What would you use and why?
[05:52:35] <Voxel> Is jQuery even used these days? Is it okay to use?
[05:52:58] <Cork> yes it is used, and quite heavily
[05:53:24] <Cork> for webplatform i would stay away from fetch right now (as it requires quite modern browsers)
[05:53:37] <Cork> for webextensions i wouldn't go near jquery
[05:53:50] <Cork> anyway i need to run
[05:54:06] <Voxel> Roger that! Thank you very much, dear Cork
[14:38:01] <_savage> Given a set of <select> elements, how do I select only those with a specific <option> ?
[14:38:51] <_savage> Is there a selector expression, or need I iterate using each() and check val() ?
[16:13:12] <robertmaxrees> _savage you can use .filter() for stuff like that.
