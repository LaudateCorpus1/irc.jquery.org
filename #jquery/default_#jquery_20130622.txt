[00:15:09] <ryorky1> I don't use prototype.js like at all, but I was just wondering  if it can be used in mobile browsers?
[00:16:02] <Reck> I am using $.get to get a HTML page. I get it back in the variable data. I am trying to count .message elements in this data using html(data).length, but it's not working. How can I count elements in this data?
[00:16:30] <MattDunbar> ryorky1: it works on the iPhone 5 / ios 7 and galaxy s3 / chrome.  not sure about other browsers, but its a start.
[00:18:31] <ryorky1> MattDunbar:  tnx, I'm just working with a really cool plugin.  But for some reason it uses prototype.js for some js code.  tnx for the info
[00:19:01] <ryorky1> Its good to know that I can use it in mobile browsers
[00:40:21] <phpdude> can you guys look at my source code on my shopping cart when I click place order now, nothing happends it just sits there www.greenteabeans.com/beagle3/cart.html
[01:28:09] <xid> I have discovered that there is an "exception thrown and not caught" error http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9521
[01:28:13] <xid> only seems to affect IE
[01:28:31] <xid> seems to be caused by that line/patch
[01:30:20] <xid> actually this seems to be a drupal thing

[01:41:45] <joker_89> hi, how can i refresh new results when i scroll the page to the bottom? like facebuk
[02:04:08] <SuperTyp> hey guys I use the reveal modal jquery plugin and I want it to use it with a cookie
[02:04:22] <SuperTyp> I found this jquery cookie plugin
[02:04:27] <SuperTyp> https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie/blob/master/README.md
[02:04:40] <SuperTyp> but I am not really sure how to use it right
[02:23:57] <sammich> okay, css/layout question, not jQ, http://jsfiddle.net/FNMwh/2/
[02:24:11] <sammich> why is div.backer on top?
[02:25:10] <sammich> oh dammit, nvmd
[02:26:13] <ryorky1> what does the following error mean?
[02:26:17] <ryorky1> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'options' of undefined
[02:26:32] <ryorky1> from my jquery-ui.js file
[02:26:40] <sammich> something.options, 'something' is undefined
[02:26:47] <sammich> can't read from something that doesn't exist
[02:27:53] <ryorky1> sammich, when I expand the error it is giving me anonymous functions  for basically everything
[02:28:19] <sammich> that's really how it goes
[02:28:29] <sammich> do you have an example you can provide for us?
[02:28:40] <ryorky1> sammich:  I can provide code
[02:28:57] <ryorky1> sammich, will that help
[02:29:34] <sammich> of course :)
[02:31:55] <ryorky1> sammich:  https://gist.github.com/ryorky1/5840153
[02:32:37] <ryorky1> the problem occurs after loadBrancg and then trying to drag and drop a file into the new folder
[02:32:46] <ryorky1> *loadBranch
[02:34:24] <ryorky1> rather after the expandNode on line 114 of index.html and then trying to drag and drop which I added the code for on line 150 of index.html
[02:36:27] <ryorky1> sammich:  rather, the drag and drop line is line 53 of index.html.erb
[02:36:44] <sammich> in the gist too?
[02:38:32] <ryorky1> sammich:  yes, the dnd line is line 53-55 in my code, that seems to be what is causing the error
[02:39:37] <ryorky1> sammich:  the code works with it, but throws the error, but without it, I can't drag and drop after loading the new branch
[02:40:29] <ryorky1> sammich:  line 53-55 in the index.html.erb file
[02:41:09] <sammich> starting with rows.find("directory?
[02:41:26] <ryorky1> sammich:  corrrect
[02:42:18] <SuperTyp> I want to use a modal once a session
[02:43:06] <SuperTyp> I have created the modal with the reveal modal plugin and want to use the https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie plugin
[02:43:21] <SuperTyp> may some1 help me implemeting it right?
[02:43:49] <ryorky1> sammich:  just as an fyi, it also gives me an unrecognized expression error when dragging on top of the file, before the drop.  I get the cannot read property of 'options' error when I actually drop the file
[02:44:57] <sammich> just gonna warn you, I'm not sure I can see what's wrong until I have a working sample :|
[02:45:36] <sammich> I've made droppables before, but I usually put in a stack of debug things in to see where it happens
[02:45:44] <ryorky1> sammich:  can I screen share w/ you?
[02:45:56] <sammich> what protocol?
[02:46:13] <ryorky1> skype
[02:46:40] <ryorky1> sammich:  ^^
[02:46:46] <sammich> one sec
[02:47:06] <ryorky1> k
[02:47:08] <sammich> kinda have to set up an account and download it ;)
[02:48:27] <sammich> Cromulent: hei
[02:48:33] <ryorky1> sammich:  k
[02:48:57] <jeremy-> Today I was having a problem with jquery ui autocomplete ... I came here for help and I got some good advise in troubleshooting the ajax request / success -> error to see what was going on
[02:49:42] <jeremy-> in the end it turned out that with my php handler, if i had the ?> to the bottom of the php file, the jquery ajax request cant parse the data using ajax -> success -> response
[02:50:08] <sammich> ryorky1: okay PM time
[02:50:09] <jeremy-> (ie, if the PHP which returned json ends with ?>, it throws an error on my jquery). Why is this?
[02:50:21] <ryorky1> sammich:  I'll let u PM me
[03:00:38] <SuperTyp> hey guys dont ignore me :D
[03:12:17] <eni> hi i'm using http://jamesflorentino.github.io/nanoScrollerJS/ to add a simple scroller to my divs. but it won't add it when the data is added dynamically. any idea what approach to use to fix this?
[03:13:07] <Cromulent> sammich: heh hi
[03:13:45] <sammich> how's that convo with ryan going ;)
[03:17:14] <SuperTyp> why do I get the syntax error "<!DOCTYPE html>" when I implement the jquery-cookie plugin
[03:17:24] <SuperTyp> ?
[03:21:47] <pingec> what is a good way to detect 'taphold' event with jquery?
[03:26:54] <F37> I have a simple question...Can anybody convince me on why jquery is a good option to use over other libs
[03:28:06] <F37> ..like m new to it...and would like to know the features that set it apart
[03:28:18] <F37> Anyone ?
[03:28:31] <SuperTyp> well I am new to jQuery too
[03:29:13] <SuperTyp> and as I solved some problems like implementing a modal to my website with jQuery, and don't want to miss jQuery anymore
[03:29:33] <SuperTyp> it is really nice
[03:30:15] <F37> Wat do u find as its best feature
[03:30:26] <j_wright> F37: if you have found another lib that provides more of what you need in a way more suited to you, go ahead and use it
[03:39:50] <SuperTyp> I get a syntax error after implementing the jQuery-cookie plugin: SyntaxError: <!DOCTYPE html>
[03:40:06] <SuperTyp> I don't know how to fix this, can someone help me pls?
[03:44:00] <ryorky1> SuperTyp:  http://richardhulse.blogspot.com/2008/10/javascript-console-syntax-error-on.html
[03:44:19] <ryorky1> hopefullt that'll solve ur problem
[03:50:59] <SuperTyp> hm when I understand it right, because my english is not that good, the error comes from a js file that is not a js file
[03:51:08] <SuperTyp> problem the js file IS a js file
[03:51:09] <SuperTyp> ...
[03:51:24] <SuperTyp> its the jQuery.cookie.js file
[03:51:27] <SuperTyp> =(
[03:52:27] <ryorky1> supertyp:  is there a file in the src tag?
[03:52:49] <jeremy-> You will never solve your issue unless you pastebin the relevant code for people to see
[03:53:02] <jeremy-> i imagine if you end up trying to do that, you will remove some stuff form the code and end up isolating the issue anyway
[03:53:27] <ryorky1> supertyp:  check out this link too:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15103460/jquery-on-a-well-formed-html-string-results-in-syntax-error-unrecognized-expr
[03:53:33] <jeremy-> its probably your script tag, or perhaps you are calling javascript in the wrong order when you have prerequisites
[03:53:34] <SuperTyp> is the jquery-cookie plugin not well known?
[03:54:38] <ryorky1> supertyp:  I've never used it:  your better off using your base language, i.e. ASP, php, ruby, etc. to store your sessions/session info
[03:54:52] <SuperTyp> lol wtf
[03:54:54] <SuperTyp> wait a sec
[03:55:14] <SuperTyp> seems like the browser saved the js file not correctly
[03:55:26] <ryorky1> there ya go
[03:55:52] <SuperTyp> thanks a lot
[03:56:04] <SuperTyp> you sirs gave me the right clue
[04:02:35] <Lightsaber> Hi, I am getting format of JSON data with JQuery Ajax in real-time. How can I assign some of this data to a variable?
[04:05:48] <ryorky1> Lightsaber:  yourvariablename = data.whatever
[04:05:56] <ryorky1> make sense?
[04:06:06] <ryorky1> can you give a pastie?
[04:09:46] <SuperTyp> is this the right way to fire a modal once by a session? http://pastebin.com/r9kruMhj
[04:10:10] <SuperTyp> Because when I call the page again the modal fires again...
[04:12:17] <ryorky1> Supertype:  you need to ad more logic to your if statement, b/c your basically just saying if the session exists open the modal
[04:13:05] <ryorky1> supertyp:  or just reset the cooke value on modalclose
[04:13:29] <ryorky1> make sense?
[04:13:38] <SuperTyp> let me try it
[04:13:39] <SuperTyp> thanks
[04:14:20] <ryorky1> np, let me know if you have fufrther questions
[04:15:09] <SuperTyp> hm...how can I ask for the modal is closed?
[04:17:17] <faLUCE> hello. I created a html page with this (very short) code:   http://jsfiddle.net/gianlucaguarini/56Szw/   . But it works on jsfiddle and not on my page:  http://79.18.193.172:55552/testtouch.html   .... where can be the error?
[04:17:23] <SuperTyp> never midn
[04:17:24] <SuperTyp> mind
[04:18:29] <ryorky1> supertyp:  you could also just add another value to the cookie, set it as null and just increment the second value if the cookie already exists.  figure it out?
[04:18:32] <SuperTyp> ryorky1 thats what you meant by more logic? http://pastebin.com/Pit60873
[04:18:32] <SuperTyp> ^^
[04:18:54] <faLUCE> just solved. never mind
[04:18:55] <ryorky1> supertyp:  yup
[04:19:02] <SuperTyp> thanks ryorky1++
[04:19:07] <ryorky1> np
[04:21:00] <Lightsaber> ryorkl ı have seen your message just. ı've already tried so but  a value is not assigned to  variable.
[04:25:21] <Lightsaber> ryorkyl??
[04:30:12] <Lightsaber> is there anybody to help me?
[04:32:55] <ryorky1> SuperTyp:  did ur last paste not work?
[04:35:35] <ryorky1> Supertyp:  u need to set the variable before your if statement
[04:36:17] <ryorky1> currently it's undefined.  Use console.log to find out what it's value is
[04:36:28] <ryorky1> before the if statement
[04:38:22] <Lightsaber> ryorkyl can you help me?
[04:38:52] <SuperTyp> ryorky1 it did work why?
[04:39:41] <SuperTyp> I am fine^^
[04:40:16] <Lightsaber> ı've tried so: myvariable=data.whatever but it didnt work
[04:41:33] <ryorky1> supertyp: k, good
[04:50:50] <Lightsaber> who can help me?
[04:51:41] <SuperTyp> I would to but I have no idea
[04:52:29] <joker_89> Hi i am using ajax to get results from a database using scrolling. My problem is that in each results i need to know the last id for the next scroll request
[04:53:30] <joker_89> But i dont know how to do it.. Because the ajax post only recive text and cannot modify some variable of my principal pagr
[04:54:26] <Lightsaber> how do you show result on page? on ul?
[04:54:53] <joker_89> Divs
[04:54:55] <joker_89> With ids
[04:58:42] <ryorky1> Lightsaber:  .whatever is the object that is being returned from the request, so data.name would get you the name for example
[04:59:03] <ryorky1> make sense?
[04:59:37] <ryorky1> Lightsaber:  paste your code
[04:59:55] <Lightsaber> joker :you assign a class these divs later , use this $(".yourclass:last) , and you get which you want attribute
[05:00:04] <ryorky1> joker_89:  paste code
[05:01:51] <ryorky1> Lightsaber:  it's from an ajax callback, he just needs to loop through the object that's returned and just grab the last one
[05:02:07] <ryorky1> joker_89:  ^^
[05:04:54] <joker_89> One momeny
[05:05:12] <Lightsaber> ryorkyl: my codes http://pastebin.com/hW4L2c5K
[05:05:33] <joker_89> Ok i think whit last
[05:05:38] <joker_89> Will be auficient
[05:05:42] <joker_89> :p

[06:40:28] <newtothis> if you pop n items from arr and n>arr.length, you get undefined - this behavior is perfect for me. but to get it, i have a loop doing otherarr.unshift(arr.pop()) - is there a way to do it with slices or something similar?
[06:41:31] <newtothis> slices don't return undefined for arr.slice(-n) if n>arr.size, they just stop... maybe some nice way to get n-arr.size times undefined added to the result?
[06:41:47] <newtothis> it just doesn't look nice :/
[06:47:27] <kasper> Hi i have this code for do an scroll page down for show more db results, the problem is that the results have a <div class="div_area".. which I always get the :last, but didn't work because never gets the divs created dinamically : http://pastebin.com/srjEFFgH
[06:53:41] <shahin8r> My god, i'm getting crazy about this. Anyone know why this css is ignored? Firebug just ignores the css properties. Look: http://db.tt/5i1YkLET

[07:17:37] <potkettle`> does anyone know how i access the autocomplete list when i type something in?
[07:17:52] <potkettle`> i.e if i hit A - i'd like to get access to the list with all possible results
[07:17:53] <sammich> data(ui-autocomplete) iirc
[07:18:02] <sammich> oh
[07:18:13] <sammich> ah yeah, that's what you want
[07:18:20] <potkettle`> thanks, ill give it a whirl
[07:18:22] <charpandnl> Ey shoky
[07:18:25] <charpandnl> how r ya?
[07:18:27] <potkettle`> and if t works ill send you imaginary good will :D
[07:18:38] <charpandnl> (formerly known as farmer-duck)
[07:18:57] <shoky> hi charpandnl-farmer-duck , i'm good thx ;]
[07:19:01] <sammich> potkettle`: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#custom-data, open source
[07:19:06] <Lightsaber> :D peki hocam bakacaz bi çaresine ayrıca hocam adult script için sammichten yardım al bence
[07:19:22] <sammich> actually, that might not be quite it
[07:19:28] <Lightsaber> english: thank you for oyur help ercag
[07:19:42] <charpandnl> Yeah, thought I should register some nick ;) nobody should post under my name {evil}
[07:19:53] <potkettle`> thanks sammich this is what I'm actually working with. So in the example if i hit J, I'd also like to get a hold of the entire result list in a variable
[07:20:15] <potkettle`> I'm just looking at your first suggestion now to see if that works
[07:21:05] <sammich> that last part appears to be a 'one at a time' thing
[07:21:45] <Lightsaber> guys where are you from ?
[07:21:51] <sammich> so you might be pushing your item to a variable in that portion of the code
[07:22:01] <sammich> variable: list
[07:22:06] <potkettle`> yup - any idea what the popup list of potential results is called?
[07:23:12] <sammich> ahh there it is
[07:23:16] <sammich> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-response
[07:23:31] <sammich> I've had to use that to add a 'no results'
[07:24:45] <potkettle`> ah that looks to be the trick. Thanks a lot for the help
[07:24:59] <sammich> no worries
[07:25:45] <Lightsaber> sammich: ı am getting  format of JSON data with Jquery AJAX  in real-time. How can i assign some of this data to a variable?
[07:26:51] <Lightsaber> ı tried so : myvariable = myfunction.info but it didnt work
[07:30:34] <Lightsaber> sammich: are you here?
[07:30:54] <sammich> .done(function(result) { somevar = result; });
[07:32:14] <Lightsaber> what ı tried so but it didnt work
[07:32:25] <sammich> is the datatype json?
[07:32:32] <Lightsaber> yes
[07:32:50] <shoky> my guess is he's trying to access that variable outside the callback, synchronously
[07:32:52] <sammich> if you look in your network tab in your inspector/firebug, is the data text or a json object?
[07:33:00] <sammich> ah
[07:33:38] <sammich> typically for async stuff, you use a callback, or use the data inside the promise(?) function
[07:34:25] <sammich> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[07:34:27] <shoky> Lightsaber: post your code on some pastebin
[07:34:40] <Lightsaber> ok please just the minute
[07:34:40] <sammich> jsfiddle, so I can...tinker with it
[07:35:47] <Lightsaber> http://pastebin.com/hW4L2c5K
[07:36:22] <shoky> that's not enough , you're not showing the part that's not working for you
[07:36:38] <shoky> also.. those vars are local to that callback function
[07:37:00] <sammich> hmm, I should use that method
[07:37:08] <sammich> but yeah, what shoky said
[07:37:13] <Lightsaber> and ı use this variables on if statements
[07:37:30] <Lightsaber> if statements didnt work
[07:37:33] <shoky> Lightsaber: those if statements must also be in a callback
[07:37:43] <sammich> you can do all your work inside that function, if that's possible
[07:38:56] <Lightsaber> ı shouldnt get data outside on this function??
[07:39:56] <shoky> we can't help you much if you don't show the problematic code
[07:40:02] <sammich> ajax is 'asynchronus'
[07:40:15] <sammich> meaning that it happens out of time of the rest of your function
[07:40:42] <sammich> the function that called your $.getJSON would be long finished
[07:40:54] <sammich> by the time your $.getJSON got it's data
[07:42:05] <Lightsaber> http://pastebin.com/ed3KZLUF my if statements
[07:43:10] <shoky> you didn't show any variable called uyarsay or engelsay
[07:43:22] <Alina-malina> Hello all! I am having difficulties with some code on one website, i cant understand how it generate a parameter to pass to server, does jquery have abbility to generate links string from encrypted data and then pass with GET method to server?
[07:43:23] <sammich> okay, I just wanna say that code is pretty...non-kosher
[07:43:36] <shoky> yeah that too
[07:43:54] <shoky> Lightsaber: there are many bad parts there...
[07:44:18] <sammich> it's rather ironic the only place he didn't put a function is where he should've put one...
[07:44:19] <Alina-malina> how i can track the script to see what it does step-by-step?
[07:44:33] <shoky> sammich heh
[07:44:54] <Lightsaber> what should i do?
[07:45:00] <shoky> Lightsaber: you need to take it slower, and learn some javascript properly
[07:45:19] <sammich> BTB
[07:45:23] <sammich> back to basics
[07:46:32] <shoky> Alina-malina: you can use a debugger...
[07:46:39] <sammich> I'll leave this one to you shoky
[07:46:44] <Alina-malina> shoky, which one?
[07:46:44] <Lightsaber> its the most basic position of this code
[07:46:53] <shoky> Alina-malina: every browser has one in their devtools
[07:47:05] <shoky> ?ftj @ Alina-malina
[07:47:05] <bot-t> Alina-malina, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[07:47:11] <Alina-malina> yes, i have firebug, but it is not showing anything
[07:47:53] <shoky> we can't guess what you're doing
[07:49:02] <shoky> well we can, but that won't help anybody
[07:49:06] <Alina-malina> ok, here is the webpage when i am clicking on next button it generate a GET method, so there is one parameter i cant find how it is being generated, here is the link : https://plus.google.com/photos/110667589447712665883/albums/5819602871580831009/5819605008499305266?pid=5819605008499305266&oid=110667589447712665883
[07:49:47] <shoky> there's no jquery on that page..
[07:49:59] <sammich> is that a graduation?
[07:50:11] <shoky> and the JS there is probably all minified
[07:50:12] <Alina-malina> no jquery?
[07:50:17] <shoky> it's production code, not development code
[07:50:24] <Alina-malina> what does it mean?
[07:50:35] <shoky> what does what mean
[07:51:00] <Alina-malina> you say it is minified and production code, you mean it is encypted somehow?
[07:51:03] <Lightsaber> shoky ı compare the values of inputs if these of one is empty ı compare other one with empty one's value on database
[07:51:29] <Alina-malina> there is only one parameter i cant figure out, i guess it comes encrypted, but i am not sure, i want to track the script and see what is happening
[07:51:40] <shoky> Alina-malina:  not encrypted, but minified - so it's very hard to understand just by looking at the code, it's not meant for humans to read it
[07:52:25] <Alina-malina> well i figure out the stuff, but only 1 parameter, it is hidden i searh everywhere from jqury get responses to html code, but i cant find that thing:(
[07:52:37] <Alina-malina> *javascript get responses
[07:52:48] <shoky> good luck.
[07:53:12] <Lightsaber> shoky did you see my message?
[07:53:58] <shoky> Lightsaber: yes.. no idea what you want to say there
[07:55:11] <Lightsaber> ercag_:
[07:55:53] <Lightsaber> shoky thanks for your interest, sammich: have you got any idea about my problem?
[07:56:16] <sammich> I have many ideas
[07:56:26] <Lightsaber> ?
[07:56:40] <sammich> your code isn't structured...right
[07:57:42] <Lightsaber> how can i it structure right?
[07:57:47] <sammich> you need to understand how to read APIs, for one, you shouldn't really define functions inline unless you know what you're doing
[07:57:54] <amaroks> Hello, How would you format this number -0.0054 to look like -54 ?
[07:58:38] <shoky> ?js -0.0054 * 10000
[07:58:41] <bot-t> shoky: -54
[07:59:30] <shoky> amaroks ^
[07:59:33] <sammich> I'll bet it's pretty easy if you toString that number
[07:59:40] <sammich> and just cut out the 0's
[07:59:49] <shoky> sounds much harder than my way ;p
[07:59:49] <sammich> the non-significant numbers
[08:00:05] <sammich> yeah, it's easy if you know what the exponent is :p
[08:00:19] <shoky> if he has a more general question, he should ask it ;P
[08:00:26] <Lightsaber> sammich: ı know what ı am doing
[08:00:34] <shoky> Lightsaber: you most definitely do not
[08:00:51] <sammich> then you'll know the 'success' value is supposed to be an anonymous function
[08:01:08] <sammich> and that you also pasted two different peices of your code
[08:01:10] <shoky> a function*
[08:01:20] <sammich> yeah, my bad
[08:01:27] <sammich> a bit ahead of myself there
[08:01:31] <amaroks> shoky: Yes thanks
[08:02:07] <sammich> amaroks: if you don't know how many zeroes, you can do it my way :)
[08:03:10] <sammich> sorry, lightsaber, young padawan, you have a long way before you learn the ways of the script
[08:06:59] <Lightsaber> how is success  value supposed to be an anonymous function?
[08:07:29] <sammich> success: function() { /* do something */ }
[08:08:00] <sammich> look up the API for the arguments for that success function
[08:10:07] <Lightsaber> can ı do some of function in success value
[08:12:29] <sammich> have you read the API for http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/?
[08:14:04] <sammich> I was a little off, you might be better off calling '$.getJSON(params).done(function() { /**/ })
[08:14:32] <sammich> $.getJSON(params).done(function(data) { /* code */ })
[08:15:52] <Lightsaber>  ı dont want my functions in a json callback but you want tell me ı should definite variables in json callback
[08:16:13] <sammich> um, why not?
[08:16:34] <sammich> look, that's the API, you're going to be either giving it a function, or you define one inline
[08:16:59] <sammich> best of luck, I'm off
[08:17:44] <Lightsaber> thanks a lot sammich
[08:35:17] <GnKnG> Hello
[08:44:54] <Bloomberg> Morning guys!!
[08:48:03] <Bloomberg> I have a problem using the datepicker jquery plugin
[08:48:21] <Bloomberg> I need to select two or three times the input for show me the datepicker
[08:48:30] <Bloomberg> Never the first time it does show me!
[09:11:49] <shoky> Bloomberg: no idea what you mean
[09:12:08] <shoky> Bloomberg: make a jsfiddle/demo of your problem
[09:13:46] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/opirer/1/edit
[09:14:55] <shoky> Bloomberg: an actual demo of your problem. you have no datepicker there
[09:20:02] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/opirer/2/edit
[09:20:07] <Bloomberg> shoky
[09:20:10] <Bloomberg> see that
[09:21:16] <shoky> Bloomberg: that has php code.. and it has no <html> or <body> even.. make a demo that actually shows the input/datepicker
[09:21:37] <shoky> Bloomberg: here's an example of a working demo  http://jsbin.com/ehacec/1/edit
[09:22:34] <shoky> Bloomberg: you need to only initialize the datepicker once, NOT on every click
[09:23:36] <shoky> follow the examples on jqueryui.com.  don't make up your own usage
[10:32:41] <Krambiorix> hi, i followed this website so my session will never be timed out... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12597176/how-to-keep-session-alive-without-reloading-page   But this doesn't work for me... I still get logged out when i refresh my page after 5 mins
[10:37:28] <vinky_> Krambiorix, is the function getting called?
[10:41:09] <Krambiorix> vinky_, yes
[10:48:24] <dalnet22> Which channel would I ask for help regarding .htaccess?
[10:48:53] <jost> dalnet22: #httpd
[10:48:56] <dalnet22> thanks
[10:52:16] <newtothis> say, can i unpack an array to splice it into another? for ex a= [1,2,3]; a.splice(2,0,[4,5,6]) results in a === [1,2,[4,5,6],3] but what i need is [1,2,4,5,6,3].
[10:52:42] <newtothis> i could splice the first part off and the last one and concat all 3, but there must be something better, right?
[10:53:25] <dcorona_irc_2020> is there a way to use deferred/pipe to call a function when a plain js function is complete executing the code (even if it has some ajax calls)
[10:54:28] <newtothis> dcorona, you could pass the continuation to it, cps like
[10:56:12] <dcorona_irc_2020> newtothis:  I dont get you. I couldn't change the code of the function in question. but want to have a call back (piggy back) whenever the function is called by anyevents
[10:56:57] <shoky> newtothis: a.splice.bind(a,2,0).apply(a,[4,5,6])   or   a.splice.apply(a,[2,0].concat([4,5,6]))   :P
[10:57:24] <shoky> or of course.. a.splice.apply(a,[2,0,4,5,6]) but that's v.confusing
[10:58:03] <bongjovi> Could anyone suggest the best way to go about fixing this.. I want the #mouseover div to not disappear/flicker on hover, i understand why it's happening but i'm not sure what the best solution is: http://jsfiddle.net/z4Rjk/
[10:58:09] <newtothis> dcorona, yes i understand. i suggested passing the continuation / callback to the function in question but yea if you don't want to modify it... unless maybe you want to wrap it with (function(){func_a(); piggy();}()); ? sorry i'm new to js
[10:58:27] <newtothis> shoky, oh i see i'll try to play with it, thanks :)
[10:59:20] <motaka2> Using this function I gather all values of a form, but I dont want those values contain several submit button values but just the clicked one, what should I do?  http://pastebin.com/rT13u9QA
[11:05:42] <motaka2> no answer?
[11:09:20] <vinky_> motaka2, how is this used?
[11:20:49] <dcorona_irc_2020> newtothis: here is the source - http://jsfiddle.net/palaniraja/pERup/1/ check the console after clicking submit, newloadOne is done before the ajax success call
[11:33:31] <newtothis> dcorona_irc_2020, oh because the ajax is async, i see... maybe something like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12116505/wait-till-a-function-is-finished-until-running-another-function ? (first anwser)
[11:36:41] <dcorona_irc_2020> newtothis:  thank you, problem is I can't edit the function one to add deferred stuff. As it is third party code.
[11:41:30] <dabear> dcorona_irc_2020: so can't you edit the success callback function of loadOne either?
[11:42:48] <dabear> dcorona_irc_2020: if you can't change anything, but still wanna do something when an ajax function inside loadOne is called, you can use http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/
[11:46:42] <dcorona_irc_2020> dabear: cool, does it work if the thirdparty function does not use jquery $.ajax but someother lib to manage its xhr?
[11:46:54] <dabear> dcorona_irc_2020: nope
[11:47:27] <dabear> dcorona_irc_2020: then you gotta hook into that other libs similar methods
[11:49:42] <dcorona_irc_2020> dabear: can I call the method synchronously? sounds bad but I wonder?
[11:50:34] <dabear> ajax can it self be called in sync, but you can't dynamically change specifics of a function
[11:51:03] <dabear> however, you can dynamically replace the whole "loadOne" function with your own version
[11:51:15] <dabear> most of the time
[12:22:40] <velcrow> I am experiencing a recursion problem. See code here: http://pastebin.com/fSu1kMMC
[12:23:05] <velcrow> Basically, I want to intercept the form submission before submitting it because I want to check if the fields are valid.
[12:23:55] <velcrow> So I block the default event from happening, check what I want to, then fire the event again if everything is ok. Problem is, this triggers the exact same function and I get stuck in an infinite loop.
[12:24:02] <velcrow> Is there a way around this?
[12:28:48] <jagjr> Hi guys - Is there a way to scroll to a div with the header as fixed? It doesn't include the height of the fixed area when i use scrollTop:
[12:31:34] <jagjr> It's off by the height of the fixed div
[12:37:18] <jagjr> Can anyone help?
[12:40:21] <velcrow> jagjr, code?
[12:43:24] <bongjovi> Could anyone suggest the best way to go about fixing this.. I want the #mouseover div to not disappear/flicker on hover, i understand why it's happening but i'm not sure what the best solution is: http://jsfiddle.net/z4Rjk/
[12:46:53] <motaka2> vinky_: are you there?
[12:46:55] <motaka2> Using this function I gather all values of a form, but I dont want those values contain several submit button values but just the clicked one, what should I do? http://pastebin.com/rT13u9QA
[12:52:42] <Xgear> Hello, I am having some trouble with .each(). It doesnt seem to be triggering. Could anyone lend me a hand please? http://jsfiddle.net/UX3yq/
[12:56:15] <motaka2> Xgear: can you solve mine?
[12:56:23] <nitrodex> anyone want a bnc?
[12:57:45] <vinky_> motaka2, how is this used?
[12:57:59] <motaka2> vinky_: What do u mean ?
[12:58:29] <vinky_> where do you use it, i.e. what calls it?
[12:59:20] <kevireilly> bongjovi: do something like add and remove a class that indicates whether or not #mouseover is already showing
[13:01:04] <motaka2> vinky_: $("#content-in").off('submit').on("submit", 'form', function(e) {....}
[13:02:38] <kevireilly> motaka2: you could bind to the submit buttons themselves
[13:04:15] <vinky_> that would likely be easier
[13:04:21] <motaka2> kevireilly: thats not imprtant bu I load the form using ajax and someforms have several buttons and I submit those forms using ajax and when I do that all submit buttons have values within a form, so there is a confilict. what should I do ?
[13:04:47] <motaka2> kevireilly: maybe you have not seen the question:   Using this function I gather all values of a form, but I dont want those values contain several submit button values but just the clicked one, what should I do? http://pastebin.com/rT13u9QA
[13:06:09] <shoky> Xgear: you don't have any .subtotal-prods elements
[13:06:38] <vinky_> motaka2, if you bind on the submit button you would get the submit button in $(this) and could use this to filter out the rest of the buttons
[13:07:08] <motaka2> vinky_: I dont get u pls give me example
[13:15:01] <bytephili> why can I not have both the nav and search expanded at the same time in my mobile site? http://tenisuzivo.com
[13:15:11] <bytephili> I can open the menu and then search but the search then wont appear until I click the menu again
[13:16:54] <bytephili> nvm got it
[13:16:58] <bytephili> overflow: hidden on nav
[13:18:17] <bstro9000> hey, how do I get an SVG element to be positioned relatively within its parent? when i put it on the page, its absolutely positioned relative to the document and completely disregarding its parent container
[13:18:24] <bstro9000> oops, wrong channel, my apologies
[13:19:19] <charpandnl> hi there :)

[13:20:25] <charpandnl> haha hi shoky ;)
[13:20:36] <shoky> hiya
[13:20:45] <charpandnl> well, this ->    |    ^([0-9]|0[0-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-3]):[0-5][0-9]$    || matches HH:MM
[13:20:57] <charpandnl> and I want the colon to be replaced ^-^
[13:21:20] <shoky> er
[13:22:13] <charpandnl> yeah.. quite a struggle for me too :S
[13:24:05] <Xgear> Wat? ._.
[13:24:34] <Xgear> wtf
[13:25:24] <Xgear> Ew how dumb
[13:25:30] <Xgear> I had added two class=""
[13:25:40] <Xgear> Thanks for pointing it out shoky
[13:26:11] <shoky> ?js '12:34'.replace(/^([0-9]|0[0-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-3]):([0-5][0-9])$/, '$1MOO$2')
[13:26:14] <bot-t> shoky: "12MOO34"
[13:26:20] <shoky> charpandnl ^
[13:26:35] <shoky> charpandnl but also... '12:34'.replace(':', 'MOO')
[13:26:50] <charpandnl> mmm thnx
[13:26:56] <charpandnl> where'd you get it?
[13:27:06] <shoky> wat?
[13:27:17] <charpandnl> the structure
[13:27:41] <shoky> in the first one? i just added () around the minutes..
[13:27:42] <mydog2> hey..
[13:27:44] <bongjovi> kevireilly, i don't follow
[13:28:36] <mydog2> if i have a setup "<div id="foo1" .. <div id="foo2"...etc.. is there a way i can iterate through each fooX <<???
[13:28:36] <charpandnl> ah yeah damn... that makes it a separate pattern, and you just replace the char between the double match
[13:30:08] <kevireilly> bongjovi: i dont have your question anymore in my scrollback, but mouseenter addClass('showing') mouseleave removeClass('showing') and in mouseenter before doing all that evaluation everytime the mouse moves in that area, do if (!$('#element').hasClass('showing')) {}
[13:33:11] <bongjovi> Ah, I think the problem was that because it places a non-child div on top of the mouseenter div, when you scroll over the placed div it triggers the mouseleave event and hides the placed div.
[13:33:21] <bongjovi> that would fix that?

[14:23:22] <imsky> sup the|SonGoku
[14:23:51] <the|SonGoku> all right?
[14:29:33] <t_kjaergaard> Anyone who knows of a jquery plugin that mimics the Squarespace editor (layoutEngine) ?
[14:44:33] <mydog2> hey peeps...
[14:47:42] <Eviltwin> ?
[14:49:46] <ilhami> Hey
[14:49:53] <ilhami> anybody here?
[14:51:13] <the|SonGoku> yes, me
[14:53:23] <mydog2> hey Eviltwin
[14:54:52] <mydog2> guys.. quick question... if i have something like <td data-foo=1 data-cat=2> how can i get the value of "data-cat" while searching data-foo -- ie if data-foo==1 get data-cat.val
[14:55:31] <ilhami> brb
[14:55:40] <mydog2> everything i've seen talks about the jquery data function.. but then the docs say if you modify the data vars.. then the data func isn't valid..
[14:56:41] <shoky> mydog2: what do you wanna do, exactly?
[14:57:56] <shoky> donno what you're talking about with the data func isn't valid..
[14:58:40] <dabear> data attributes wont't change in the html if you change the .data() in an jquery object
[14:59:25] <mydog2> hey shoky - what's up... i'm considering using/testing the custom attributes.. and i want to know how to check for one custom attribute, to then get the value of another.. ie, if attribute1 is there, get the value of attribute2
[14:59:30] <dabear> data attributes will be read from the html the first time and imported into the function .data
[15:00:22] <mydog2> shoky,  - i'm going to have a situation where i dynamically create a tbl.. with a number of fields for each row..
[15:00:22] <Stephen> Well, that's because jQuery realizes the importance of d's
[15:00:51] <EwokFartPorn> And so do the women.
[15:00:52] <mydog2> it occured to me, i can simply store the vals in custom vals... for a given element
[15:00:53] <Stephen> Seeing that they really hold everything together
[15:01:14] <ilhami> Anyone who has experience with CrossRider?
[15:01:16] <Stephen> One could conceivably consider d's nuts.
[15:01:25] <EwokFartPorn> lol
[15:01:55] <Foxhoundz> !ask @ EwokFartPorn
[15:01:55] <b-ot> EwokFartPorn: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:02:11] <tw2113> keep calm and bottoms up everyone :)
[15:02:27] <EwokFartPorn> And I get in trouble.
[15:02:29] <EwokFartPorn> smh
[15:02:50] <Stephen> You know. I one helped a crew in Eastern Europe with a jQuery issue through here
[15:03:21] <Stephen> for my efforts they asked me the price of a beer here in texas and paypal'd me 1 beer
[15:03:56] <Stephen> $2.50 for a Steel Reserve
[15:04:40] <shoky> mydog2: to get all tds with 'foo' data being 1 you can do e.g.  $('#mytable').find('td.classOfTds').filter(function() { return $(this).data('foo') === '1' })
[15:04:58] <mydog2> shoky,  - here's a simple tbl that gets to what i'm looking at.. .. http://jsfiddle.net/6AAJu/  <<
[15:05:09] <shoky> mydog2:  or if the datas won't change , you can replace the filter with  .filter('[data-foo=1]')
[15:05:30] <shoky> mydog2: and to get the 'cat' data of one element you do .data('cat')
[15:05:51] <mydog2> i'm sure this is a combination of the attr() and probably val() to be able to get the data values for the custom attributes and put them in an array..
[15:06:23] <shoky> use .map(...).get() if you want to get the datas for several elements as an array
[15:06:49] <mydog2> shoky, - let me search for a few articles on this..
[15:06:51] <shoky> e.g.  var cats = $('#mytable').find('td.classOfTds').filter(function() { return $(this).data('foo') === '1' }).map(function() { return $(this).data('cat') }).get();
[15:07:43] <shoky> that gets you an array of the data-cat for all tds with data-foo of 1
[15:08:07] <EwokFartPorn> Foxhoundz: Did I ask a question?
[15:08:19] <Foxhoundz> EwokFartPorn: you jut did!
[15:08:22] <EwokFartPorn> (except for this one)
[15:08:24] <EwokFartPorn> ;)
[15:09:17] <EwokFartPorn> A better approach would say stay on topic, wouldn't it?

[15:14:22] <EwokFartPorn> (earlier discussion)
[15:15:31] <ilhami> How can I retrieve values from dropdown list?
[15:15:55] <shoky> if you mean a <select>  then .val()
[15:16:10] <ilhami> right now I am doing this
[15:16:11] <ilhami> wait
[15:16:18] <shoky> . . .
[15:16:32] <ilhami> var cMethod = document.getElementById("calcMethodList");  if(cMethod.options[cMethod.selectedIndex].text == ) {}
[15:16:41] <Stephen> $("select option").val()
[15:17:41] <shoky> ilhami:  $('#calcMethodList').find('option:selected').text()
[15:18:44] <rue> Is there a reason to use find() rather than a direct longer selector?
[15:19:01] <ilhami> whats the best method shoky? JQuery?
[15:19:04] <ilhami> or Javascript?
[15:19:16] <shoky> ilhami: depends what you mean by best
[15:20:16] <ilhami> why should I use JQuery over native JS?
[15:20:29] <shoky> do more, write less, etc.
[15:21:04] <shoky> takes care of many cross-browser inconsistencies.. the usual stuff you read about jquery. leave me alone :(
[15:21:44] <grafi> xD
[15:21:50] <grafi> leave britney alone!!!
[15:22:14] <shoky> ;p
[15:22:24] <ilhami> I dont know which one to use now
[15:22:27] <ilhami> Its a dilemma
[15:22:31] <shoky> use jquery, then

[15:22:34] <b-ot> shoky: CASE CLOASED >:|
[15:22:35] <grafi> jeah
[15:22:39] <Stephen> because jQuery 1.9.1+  allow you to earnestly tell your bos to drop old IE support
[15:22:50] <Stephen> "sorry, no support there!"
[15:22:50] <grafi> lawl
[15:23:01] <tw2113> just the 2.0 branch
[15:23:05] <ilhami> No Jquery support in IE?
[15:23:06] <ilhami> :O
[15:23:12] <Stephen> old IE
[15:23:16] <ilhami> aah ok
[15:23:16] <tw2113> 2.0 dropped IE8 and down
[15:23:18] <Stephen> 2.0+
[15:23:25] <tw2113> 1.9-1.10 will still have it
[15:23:30] <Stephen> yeah
[15:23:41] <Stephen> but pretend those are deprecated
[15:23:45] <Stephen> for security reasons
[15:23:57] <grafi> i always print a special message for ie users
[15:24:07] <ilhami> let me try JavaScript first. I can always change to JQuery later
[15:24:08] <grafi> "your browser sucks and you must die"
[15:24:09] <grafi> oô

[15:24:58] <grafi> oO
[15:25:03] <Stephen> you can
[15:25:12] <ilhami> I heard its a bad idea with JS

[15:25:21] <Stephen> you heard wrong
[15:25:29] <grafi> from whom?
[15:25:30] <grafi> :P
[15:25:37] <ilhami> in the JS channel actually.

[15:27:12] <ilhami> just trying something
[15:27:23] <joker_89> hi
[15:28:13] <joker_89> i have a problem, i am appending html code in a success of ajax request, and i want to delete the last </div> closes at the end
[15:28:43] <mydog2> hey shoky - kind of see how the test works.. if i wanted to use the attr function.. how would i get the "value" of the data-foo1 attribute?  haven't found any article that illustrates that.
[15:29:11] <shoky> mydog2: no reason to use attr for data-xxx attributes
[15:29:11] <ilhami> var cMethod = document.getElementById("calcMethodList").value; --------------- Will this work
[15:29:15] <ilhami> ?
[15:29:34] <shoky> mydog2: i showed you how to get the data attributes...  .data('foo1')
[15:29:45] <joker_89> how can i remove div closes witih jquery?
[15:30:09] <mydog2> shoky,  - i got that.. using the data().. i was curious if there's a diff approach using attr() as well?
[15:30:10] <shoky> ilhami: that will get the value of the selected option
[15:30:22] <shoky> ilhami: in jquery that would be  var cMethod = $('#calcMethodList').val()
[15:30:27] <ilhami> shoky meanwhile answer my question. I will brb... I need to get the index of the selected value :D
[15:30:57] <shoky> mydog2:  .attr('data-foo1')  if you really want to
[15:31:00] <ilhami> mylist.options[mylist.selectedIndex]; or wait is this it?
[15:31:08] <shoky> mydog2: are the docs not clear enough or what
[15:31:22] <ilhami> I think I got it.. no worries
[15:31:24] <mydog2> shoky.. let me try.. i thought i had tried that a few times!!
[15:33:23] <joker_89> well how can i do in jquery to modify an html code inside a div where i want to remove the last </div></div></div> for append before some html
[15:33:24] <joker_89> ?
[15:34:01] <shoky> joker_89: you can't append non-closed tags to the DOM
[15:34:51] <joker_89> i want to add some html code befor the three </div> tags
[15:35:34] <joker_89> imagine a <div>abcd</div> and i want to append "efg" , result <div>abcdefg</div>
[15:35:41] <shoky> var div = $(htmlstring);    and you can manipulate div with jquery methods
[15:36:06] <shoky> var div = $('<div>abcd</div>');   div.text( div.text() + 'efg' );
[15:36:59] <joker_89> is noto as simple..
[15:37:01] <joker_89> mmm
[15:37:06] <joker_89> my divs
[15:37:32] <Eviltwin> bring all the boys to the yard?
[15:38:24] <_amg> and they like, it's better than yours
[15:38:25] <_amg> damn right
[15:38:27] <_amg> it's better than yours
[15:38:33] <_amg> I can code for you, but I have to charge
[15:44:49] <acidjazz> i love the new google maps
[15:44:50] <acidjazz> i love how you cant search nearby anymore
[15:44:51] <acidjazz> its grreat becuase i never used that ever every time i loaded google maps
[15:47:26] <ilhami> shoky I was right, wasn't I?
[15:47:30] <ilhami> with the selected index thing?
[15:50:24] <shoky> ilhami: right about what?  does it work? yes? then probably you were right
[15:59:32] <ilhami> Didnt try it yet :D
[15:59:37] <ilhami> havent tested ot
[15:59:39] <ilhami> it
[16:02:57] <mydog2> shoky,  -- console.log($('#aa1').attr('data-foo'));  <<< works...
[16:03:29] <mydog2> but as you can see.. i used an ID.. is there a way to simply use/trigger off the element ???
[16:03:54] <mydog2> ie, something like >>> console.log($(td).attr('data-foo'));  ?? which didn't work by the way!!
[16:18:50] <jeremy-> mydog2: console.log($('td').........
[16:18:53] <jeremy-> you missed the quotes
[16:19:52] <jeremy-> without quotes jquery assumes you are referencing the variable named td, rather than the html dom selector 'td'.
[16:20:28] <joker_89> hi
[16:20:48] <joker_89> how can I append text after a div object?
[16:20:52] <joker_89> not inside

[16:28:25] <JohnnyCache> http://palletown.net/tf/tf/lineups.asp?id=47 > when you hover on one of the players (in the right list), the div that expands should expand with the height .prop('scrollHeight'); but since the html contents are written before i start the .animation(), it gets larger height
[16:28:28] <JohnnyCache> any ideas?
[16:30:25] <Alan294> what is wrong with this --> http://jsbin.com/ijamuc/1/edit
[16:30:29] <shoky> mydog2: still need help with that?
[16:30:32] <JohnnyCache> the mouseenter code is here: http://pastebin.com/6SSjP0a9
[16:32:09] <mydog2> shoky.. yeah... i'm missing something.. i've seen examples that say it should work.. that   ---  tt=$("td").attr("data-foo1"); << should work... but it only returns a "1"
[16:32:30] <mydog2> as opposed to the value of the data-foo1 attribute
[16:32:38] <Alan294> anyone?
[16:32:57] <mydog2> shoky,  - but ----  Once there was a <em title="huge, gigantic">large</em> dinosaur... <<
[16:33:09] <mydog2>  title = $("em").attr("title");  <<
[16:33:31] <mydog2> huge, gigantic <<
[16:33:39] <mydog2> which is should..
[16:36:12] <mydog2> td data-foo1="12" data-cat="22">blah2</td>  <<
[16:36:24] <mydog2> <td data-foo1="12" data-cat="22">blah2</td>  <<
[16:36:51] <tw2113> mydog2, we have pastebins and jsfiddles for a reason
[16:37:00] <tw2113> oops
[16:37:02] <tw2113> disregard
[16:37:07] <tw2113> it looked like a paste to me
[16:37:13] <tw2113> sorry mydog2 :)
[16:37:19] <mydog2> tw2113,  - np...
[16:37:30] <mydog2> i'm thinking of tossing it all in the trash!
[16:37:55] <tw2113> exchanging it for a better version?
[16:38:06] <mydog2> yeah.. that's it!
[16:39:59] <Alan294> did anyone get a chance to peek at my code
[16:44:43] <mydog2> Alan294, - what are you trying to do?
[16:44:44] <shoky> mydog2: if you got a problem make a jsfiddle. didn't i tell you to use .data() anyway?
[16:45:17] <shoky> mydog2: $("td").attr("data-foo1");   will get the data-foo1 attribute of the FIRST td only
[16:45:20] <mydog2> shoky,  - i know.. and i get the data.. i'm curious to how/if you can do it using "attr"!!
[16:45:48] <shoky> you can.. if its not working, make a fiddle
[16:46:23] <mydog2> shoky,  - what you have is what i inserted/tested.. but it keeps generating a "1" instead of a "12" which is the value...
[16:46:32] <shoky> mydog2: link me
[16:48:25] <joker_89> how can i make the jquery to ignore if i close more </div> than the divs tags openend?
[16:49:12] <shoky> it doesn't ignore them already?
[16:49:34] <shoky> anyway.. it's meant to be used with proper html, so you better use proper html
[16:50:03] <joker_89> uff
[16:50:25] <joker_89> not possible?
[16:51:51] <shoky> not worth getting into
[16:53:01] <shoky> though it seems to work fine to me.. http://jsfiddle.net/NRWLA/
[16:53:45] <joker_89> the problem is another
[16:54:16] <shoky> just use proper html and stop making everyone sad
[16:54:48] <joker_89> i show 50 lines , which can be from level 1 to level 4, an ecah level is closed with a div
[16:55:32] <joker_89> if line 50 is in level 1 then is diferent if is in level 4 because when i use the jquery i put 50 more lines afther the last
[16:55:46] <joker_89> without losing the structure of the div levels
[16:55:54] <zok> Does anyone know how to make the validate plugin do a remote/ajax call to a script and display an image depending on what the ajax call returns?
[16:55:58] <zok> I figured out how to do it with text
[16:56:01] <zok> But not an image...
[17:04:37] <mydog2> hey shoky  - here's the stripped down jsfiddle.. http://jsfiddle.net/6AAJu/2/  <<
[17:05:12] <mydog2> tt=$("td").attr("data-foo1");   <<< is the line that's not doing what i thought it could/should!
[17:12:34] <shoky> mydog2: the first td doesn't have a data-foo1 attribute
[17:13:18] <mydog2> doh!! so it doesn't find the 1st matching?? it just finds the 1st???
[17:13:37] <shoky> it matches "td"
[17:13:49] <shoky> and gets the data-foo1 attribute of the first matching element
[17:14:01] <shoky> very simple
[17:19:03] <etfreima> Hi, can someone please help me out?
[17:19:27] <mydog2> shoky,  - makes sense...
[17:20:50] <etfreima> Can someone help me out please?
[17:25:31] <tw2113> apparently no one answered etfreima fast eough
[17:25:33] <tw2113> enough*
[17:25:45] <tw2113> 3 minutes is just too long
[17:27:00] <cockmonger> can someone give me a hand with using .hover()?
[17:27:24] <tw2113> what's the issue?
[17:27:37] <cockmonger> Well, heres the site I'm working on
[17:27:44] <cockmonger> http://extraterrestrials.zapto.org/
[17:28:06] <cockmonger> If you over over the first grey box enough, you'll see it
[17:28:18] <cockmonger> In the darker grey box
[17:28:38] <tw2113> looks like the animations are the issue more than the hover
[17:28:52] <cockmonger> how would I fix this?
[17:29:43] <cockmonger> I mean, the animations aren't finished, the slideToggle is what i believe to be the issue
[17:30:51] <mydog2> and shoky  - i'm assuming i can craft a each function that would iterate through each "td" with the data-foo custom attribute...
[17:31:09] <cockmonger> on mouseleave, the white content box is supposed to be visible, which now it is only half the time
[17:33:58] <cockmonger> If I use .on('mouseenter', func... it works, but I'm trying to make it work with the hoverIntent addon
[17:34:07] <grafi> why?
[17:34:16] <grafi> if you already found a way that works?
[17:34:55] <cockmonger> with the hoverintent, it only triggers after the mouse has been there for sometime, I don't want it triggered immediately
[17:40:16] <cockmonger> any clues?
[17:40:24] <shoky> mydog2: no reason to assume. and btw the .map also iterates through each matched element
[17:42:14] <mydog2> cool...
[17:42:20] <mydog2> thanks dude
[17:43:21] <grafi> remove the mouseleave and try again?
[17:43:47] <cockmonger> the whole mouseleave function?
[17:44:20] <grafi> that makes it easier to see whats wrong, probably
[17:44:29] <grafi> just comment it out
[17:45:05] <cockmonger> It's within mouseleave that's causing the slideToggle to screw up
[17:45:30] <cockmonger> updated it though, you can check the link
[17:45:45] <grafi> hm
[17:46:42] <grafi> is on("mouseover.hoverintent") really how you use hoverintent? shouldnt it be .hoverIntent() ?
[17:47:00] <mydog2> shoky,  - i do have one more question.. kind of an arch issue?
[17:47:16] <cockmonger> Yeah, just changed it back, I was trying a couple things
[17:47:50] <grafi> ok so
[17:48:14] <grafi> what exactly should happen? top div gets smaller, white div shows up, bottom div disappears?
[17:48:21] <grafi> and when the mouse leaves?
[17:49:07] <cockmonger> here, I'll update so it works perfectly, just without hoverIntent
[17:49:41] <cockmonger> updated it
[17:50:29] <grafi> that still messes up when you mouseover in from the right
[17:50:31] <grafi> badly
[17:50:45] <cockmonger> Yeah, I need to fix that, but later
[17:50:59] <cockmonger> Want to tackle the bugs once at a time
[17:51:16] <grafi> okidoke
[17:51:27] <grafi> at least i see what you want it to do now :p
[17:51:32] <cockmonger> yeah
[17:52:02] <cockmonger> I'll put in hoverIntent, so you can compare
[17:54:00] <cockmonger> I bet the addon isn't linked properly, it doesn't seem to be requiring a specific time to hover over the area
[17:54:13] <mydog2> shoky,  --- fiddle >> http://jsfiddle.net/6AAJu/3/ <<
[17:54:56] <mydog2> basically.. i'm setting up a form.. where the user is going to modify multiple rows.. and once that's done, they all get back to the serverside to update the tbls..
[17:55:39] <mydog2> so i'm basically going to have a 2D set of data that has to be sent back to the server.. and then updated back into the tbls as required...
[17:56:16] <mydog2> this is going to require iterating through the "rows/cols".. and i'm not sure if positional, or named iteration is better..
[17:57:20] <mydog2> shoky - but my question to you.. is if a user selects the submitBTN.. is there a way to then get the "peer" TD elements of the same parent TR?
[17:57:50] <mydog2> I'm pretty sure there is.. ie, the sibling.. but haven't found it yet..
[17:57:59] <Prancer> And now for something completely different...
[18:04:43] <shoky> mydog2: in the event handler you can use .closest('tr') to get the containing tr
[18:07:30] <shoky> mydog2: http://jsfiddle.net/6AAJu/4/
[18:09:51] <mydog2> shoky,  - you da' man!!! or woman!
[18:10:03] <mydog2> shoky,  - are you in the us?
[18:10:16] <gry> tsk
[18:10:36] <shoky> mydog2 nope
[18:10:36] <grafi> cockmonger http://pastebin.com/u7vXFvs6 this seems to work for me, removing all the other stuff you have there
[18:19:51] <cockmonger> I'll try that out man
[18:21:35] <cockmonger> argh, so close
[18:21:53] <cockmonger> on mouseleave the .article gets too wide
[18:22:39] <TeddyMurray> how do i select a jquery tab from within code?
[18:22:48] <TeddyMurray> ive tried this from stackoverflow:
[18:22:51] <TeddyMurray> $("#tabs").tabs( "select" , 2);
[18:22:57] <TeddyMurray> but it says that select is not a valid function
[18:23:34] <cockmonger> grafi - fixed it
[18:23:39] <grafi> cockmonger thats because it doesnt start at 100% :P in the second function change 100% ...
[18:23:40] <grafi> ok :P
[18:24:11] <cockmonger> Thanks man!, how'd you figure that out without using .on('mouseleave', func....)?
[18:24:52] <grafi> hm?
[18:25:24] <cockmonger> I'm sorta new to jquery, so how does that work?
[18:25:33] <TeddyMurray> does anyone know how to change the active tab in jqueryui?
[18:25:40] <TeddyMurray> via code
[18:29:20] <`e> hi
[18:29:58] <grafi> cockmonger:  well hover can have one function for in and out or one for in and one for out, hoverIntent works the same way
[18:30:33] <modcure> when a form element value changes <-- how can i detect this?
[18:30:37] <grafi> cockmonger: you only had one function that got called on hover and after hover, additionally the mouseleave was called, so that makes a mess
[18:31:09] <grafi> cockmonger: after removing the mouseleave you jsut needed a second function for hoverintent that reversed the effect
[18:31:44] <grafi> additional problem was that jquery cant animate visibility ;)
[18:32:14] <TeddyMurray> modcure,
[18:32:16] <`e> i've a big problem i can't solve, I'm still working on it form this afternoon, when I click on a <li> element of the sidebar it load a page into a div, then into that page if I click on a button, it passes some params to a php page, perform some db actions, then i get a result. But if I change page by clicking on an other <li> element of the sidebar, then I can't click anywhere because the entire website is blocked for a pendin
[18:32:17] <`e> g request... Could it be caused from something usual?
[18:32:21] <TeddyMurray> change(function(){});
[18:32:22] <mydog2> TeddyMurray,  - did you look at  ---- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14576358/jquery-ui-dynamic-tab-auto-select
[18:32:58] <modcure> TeddyMurray, i tried that :(   its a color picker when i slide the color the text form value changes. i want to detect this change
[18:33:52] <TeddyMurray> yes ive tried those two solutions mydog2
[18:34:47] <modcure> TeddyMurray, any idea why it doesnt work for me ?
[18:34:48] <shoky> TeddyMurray:  http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#option-active
[18:35:41] <`e> I'm using delegate on the ul list to check if user selected a new element to load
[18:35:45] <`e> could be that the problem?
[18:36:17] <TeddyMurray> great shocky that worked
[18:36:17] <TeddyMurray> modcure, pastebin?
[18:36:22] <`e> (I'm also using stopImmediatePropagation() to prevent the creation of duplicates, but it doesn't solved my problem)
[18:36:44] <modcure> TeddyMurray, http://pastebin.com/bZcyyPG8
[18:37:15] <shoky> :-o
[18:37:37] <mydog2> shoky,  - so he simply had to set the active tab??
[18:38:01] <shoky> mydog2: he simply had to go through the docs
[18:38:25] <shoky> (but yes)
[18:38:31] <grafi> xD
[18:38:34] <shoky> that's what he asked to do, isn't it...
[18:38:43] <grafi> shoky can read \o/
[18:38:52] <mydog2> the link i pointed him to . had the refresh.. but not quite with the same syntax as the doc/your link.. hmm.. wonder what the diff is..
[18:39:02] <shoky> the link you pointed him is not the docs, so it's not interesting
[18:39:09] <shoky> (i didnt look at it)
[18:42:27] <shoky> modcure: sounds like you're looking for a callback hook that any decent color-picker plugin should provide, check the docs for the plugin
[18:49:19] <Prancer> shoky: Tough titty if it did, you nasty, spotted prancer!
[18:59:59] <shoky> Prancer: excuse me?
[19:01:34] <Prancer> shoky:  Oh, I'm terribly sorry to hear that, sir!
[19:01:41] <Prancer> shoky: Don't mean to offend :S
[19:01:53] <shoky> alrighty
[19:02:18] <Prancer> shoky:  Don't come here with that posh talk, you nasty, stuck-up twit!
[19:02:31] <shoky> random monty python quotes?
[19:04:35] <Prancer> shoky: I love you.
[19:05:29] <shoky> Praise: i put on women's clothing and hang around in bars
[19:05:44] <Praise> shoky, good for you.
[19:06:07] <shoky> glad we've got that settled, then
[19:06:39] <Nirvash> http://dpaste.com/1263109/ Anyone see anything obviously wrong there?
[19:07:21] <shoky> Nirvash: window.location is not a string
[19:09:09] <Nirvash> shoky: How would I go about converting it? str(window.location)
[19:09:57] <shoky> location.href
[19:10:12] <Nirvash> so location.href == 'blah' is a string that will be compared, right?
[19:10:29] <shoky> location.href == 'blah'  is a boolean
[19:10:57] <shoky> location.href is a string, ya
[19:11:07] <shoky> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.location
[19:11:16] <Nirvash> For some reason I can't get this stupid script to work =/
[19:11:31] <Nirvash> The boolean should return true, which would execute the rest of the if statement
[19:11:51] <Nirvash> And then make the id 'deny' add the 'show' property which would display the modal
[19:12:41] <shoky> console.log(location.href)
[19:12:43] <sammich> use the console to test short snippets
[19:13:18] <sammich> the console is completely invaluable to debugging
[19:14:07] <Nirvash> I just did that - don't know why I didn't think of it - and got the URL I am looking for, then <- undefined
[19:14:38] <shoky> the undefined is prolly the return value from console.log
[19:14:50] <Prancer> Correct.
[19:16:34] <compact> hi. im wanting to use: http://www.slidesjs.com/ but want the pagination on the image. ive tried setting the margin to display in it, and change the z-index but still wont show?
[19:16:36] <Nirvash> Oh okay, so it's getting the correct url... what else could be wrong?
[19:16:57] <shoky> Nirvash: give us a link to see it and we'll tell you
[19:17:09] <Nirvash> http://codemodhack.com/hosting/
[19:18:06] <shoky> that doesn't have /#deny/
[19:18:27] <Nirvash> shoky: If you 'Order Now' and fail on the form, the PHP redirects to /#deny
[19:18:53] <Nirvash> http://codemodhack.com/hosting/#deny/ It's a modal that is hidden until jquery opens it with $('#deny').modal('show');
[19:18:54] <shoky> Nirvash: and then if you run deny()  it works
[19:18:57] <Nirvash> But it's not working properly
[19:19:10] <shoky> forgot to call the function? didn't mean to put it in a function?
[19:19:11] <Nirvash> shoky: ! It does! B.b.b
[19:19:35] <Nirvash> So I should do if(location.href == 'blah'){deny()}; right?
[19:19:52] <shoky> should do whatever you wanna do
[19:19:56] <shoky> your site :P
[19:20:19] <shoky> but know that declaring a function doesn't automatically execute it
[19:20:20] <Nirvash> Haha, touche ;)
[19:20:48] <shoky> it'd be weird to do that if, just to call the function, that does the if again...
[19:21:06] <Nirvash> -__ sorry I'm being dump right now
[19:21:08] <Nirvash> dumb**
[19:21:50] <shoky> no worries
[19:21:51] <Nirvash> Okay, I had completely overlooked that I named the function that. So the function works, but isn't being executed
[19:22:01] <Nirvash> Could I add an onload to make it open?
[19:22:25] <shoky> do you really need me to answer that?
[19:22:48] <Nirvash> ;__; n-no... I'll test it myself
[19:23:28] <shoky> a $(document).ready(function() { ... }) would be enough
[19:23:28] <Nirvash> Should I use .ready or .load?
[19:23:40] <Nirvash> I'll test it now
[19:24:30] <compact__> hi. im trying out: http://www.slidesjs.com/ but I want the pagination to display on the image. ive tried margin and z-index but still wont work, any ideas? thanks
[19:24:31] <shoky> you could also just put the script at the end of <body> and forget about .ready/.load
[19:26:41] <tw2113> be lazy, do that
[19:26:50] * tw2113 avoids giving reason to be tazed
[19:26:58] <Nirvash> http://dpaste.com/1263162/ isn't that what you said?
[19:27:00] <shoky> lulz
[19:27:14] <shoky> er no
[19:27:34] <grafi> compact__ works though ;)
[19:27:49] <compact__> huh? pagination wont show on image
[19:29:30] <shoky> Nirvash: i meant:  http://dpaste.com/1263178/
[19:29:45] <shoky> Nirvash:  though the way you did it will work.. there's no reason for 2 document.ready
[19:29:48] <grafi> compact__ obv not positioned correctly: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/tweakage.JPG
[19:30:08] <grafi> compact__ but it should possible
[19:30:19] <shoky> Nirvash: and of course you can also call confirm()   there.
[19:30:32] <Nirvash> shoky: alright, let me test
[19:30:43] <compact__> what css u add to it? weird wouldnt work for me
[19:31:09] <shoky> Nirvash: and if you don't need to ever call those again.. you can just do:  http://dpaste.com/1263180/
[19:32:32] <grafi> on both slidejs-navigation and slidejs-pagination position: absolute; z-index: 20 and right: 0 for pagination and one  the main container position: relative
[19:32:38] <Nirvash> shoky: I'm getting $ is not defined
[19:32:38] <grafi> works for me
[19:32:59] <shoky> Nirvash: take a few minutes and try to make sense of that
[19:33:09] <Nirvash> Alright
[19:35:00] <Nirvash> shoky: I'm reading an article that states it's either improper js loading, bad jquery version, or running before load
[19:35:40] <shoky> Nirvash: did you include jquery before this <script>
[19:35:42] <Nirvash> I think it's jquery failing; I'll try to load from another source
[19:36:24] <Nirvash> No, I didn't; I thought ready would wait until the document was fully loaded (i.e. had the jquery from the footer)
[19:36:29] <Nirvash> Did I misunderstand that?
[19:36:57] <shoky> the "ready" thing depends on jquery being already included
[19:37:10] <shoky> $ is jQuery
[19:37:26] <Nirvash> Oh jesus... I can't believe I did that shoky...
[19:37:37] <grafi> i need a $ baby a $ is all i need *sings*
[19:37:39] <Nirvash> Thank you for your help; it appears to be working fine now
[19:37:46] <shoky> np
[19:37:46] <Nirvash> grafi: great song lol
[19:37:58] <grafi> :P
[19:38:07] <grafi> shoky is my hero

[19:41:52] * shoky tases tw2113
[19:42:19] <tw2113> *boner*
[19:42:32] <shoky> ;D
[19:42:50] <tw2113> it was the $() that turned me on, i swear
[19:43:03] <shoky> creep
[19:43:29] <tw2113> $('#tw2113).on('taze',function(){ $(this).boner = true; });
[19:43:37] <grafi> lawl
[19:43:39] <sammich> $ $ $, life is funny in a jQuery world
[19:44:14] <grafi> its more like $('#tw2113).on('taze.shoky',function(){ $(this).boner = true; }); isnt it tw2113?
[19:44:36] * tw2113 pleads the 5th while he still can
[19:44:39] <shoky> ISNT IT
[19:45:02] <tw2113> at least he doesn't give me the coldhead :D
[19:45:16] <shoky> i dont even
[19:45:39] <grafi> is there a difference between coldhead and warmhead i wonder
[19:47:35] <shoky> ?$
[19:47:36] <bot-t> bling
[19:47:49] <grafi> ?shoky
[19:47:52] <bot-t> grafi, Couldn't find "shoky" in jQuery Docs.
[19:48:03] <grafi> its like ive done this before
[19:50:23] <sammich> $('#tw2113).on('taze', '#groin', function(){ $(this).boner = true; });
[19:50:57] <grafi> $('#tw2113').trigger('taze')
[19:50:58] <grafi> oô
[19:52:51] <tw2113> new contest
[19:53:02] <tw2113> how many ways can you use jQuery methods to state that tazers give me boners
[19:53:47] <grafi> meh
[19:54:46] <tw2113> i was just going to see who participated so i knew who the pervs were anyway
[19:55:52] <grafi> sure
[19:55:57] <grafi> does that turn you on? :P
[19:56:12] <tw2113> the contest isn't a taser
[19:56:23] <tw2113> :D
[19:56:30] <grafi> tazer fetish?
[19:56:33] <grafi> funny
[19:56:34] <grafi> :P
[20:01:22] <Nirvash> shoky: You don't do PHP too do you? lol
[20:01:40] <shoky> nopes
[20:01:42] <grafi> shoky is strictly ruby on rails these days
[20:01:45] <grafi> xD
[20:01:55] <shoky> innit
[20:03:34] <grafi> in it to win it
[20:04:07] <Nirvash> Haha, I got the modals working, but now I'm having a PHP failure of some sort -_- time to debug that monster now
[20:04:31] <grafi> if its a monster
[20:04:35] <grafi> its already too late
[20:04:43] <grafi> delete it and start again
[20:04:43] <grafi> :P
[20:04:59] <Nirvash> Haha grafi, it's pretty robust for what it does. I just hate debugging...
[20:05:11] <grafi> why?
[20:05:14] <grafi> debugging is fun
[20:05:29] <grafi> the day i write something that i dont have to debug
[20:05:32] <grafi> i quit
[20:05:42] <Nirvash> Haha, right?
[20:05:56] <grafi> whats the error though? :P
[20:06:28] <Nirvash> It's going to #deny even with valid information
[20:06:57] <grafi> funny
[20:07:17] <Nirvash> Yeah, I need to just break it down so it doesn't go to the same die screen for most errors
[20:08:54] <`e> I'm using .delegate to do some actions when I load a page into a div
[20:09:31] <`e> but when I click on an element that load that page, an ajax request blocks the page
[20:09:38] <`e> it remains on pending state
[20:09:48] <`e> I've tried everything, but nothing
[20:09:58] <`e> if anyone could help me... please :)
[20:10:07] <grafi> show some code
[20:10:11] <shoky> `e link us to the page
[20:10:11] <`e> wait
[20:10:16] <`e> http://80.86.147.198:8085/ms_remote/
[20:10:19] <`e> user: admin
[20:10:23] <`e> password: prova
[20:10:42] <`e> when you click for example on "gombitelli"
[20:10:50] <`e> then on "Leggi tutti"
[20:11:05] <`e> then click on "Bocca d'arno" or "Modem1"
[20:11:32] <`e> if you open  the network tab on chrome inspector you can see the pending request
[20:12:41] <`e> (sorry for the alerts, I was trying to understand where the problem is)
[20:13:21] <`e> ajax started -> then nothing.
[20:13:24] <shoky> i don't see it blocking the page
[20:13:51] <`e> if you try to change station (gombitelli-modem-bocca d'arno) nothing happens.
[20:14:06] <`e> after clicking on "Leggi tutti"
[20:14:26] <`e> you've to close and reopen the browser or to clear the cookies
[20:15:18] <`e> shoky, doesn't appear the box with "ajax started" standing and not changing on ajax stopped?
[20:16:08] <shoky> `e well the server stops responding
[20:16:49] <`e> When you click on read all, that button calls an ajax request to a php page that gives it an id
[20:17:07] <`e> (-1, as you can see when you click for the first time on "Leggi tutti")
[20:17:28] <`e> but then when you change station and click again on "Leggi tutti" it stops
[20:17:57] <`e> i'll paste the code
[20:18:30] <grafi> the first question i would ask myself is why the request is taking forever oô
[20:19:02] <`e> It's not a timeout problem, because I tried adding the timeout to 5000 to the ajax request
[20:19:19] <`e> but nothing happens, the request is blocked, but I still can't change station
[20:20:26] <`e> http://jsfiddle.net/65LSQ/
[20:20:35] <`e> I think it's the .delegate() function the problem
[20:21:33] <`e> (sorry for my poor english, I''ve been awake since yesterday morning and I'm italian :))
[20:24:17] <`e> shoky, grafi, any idea? I'm really desperate
[20:24:52] <shoky> oh you have javascript in the .load response.. yuck
[20:25:13] <`e> could be that?
[20:25:57] <shoky> my guess is the problem is the data you're sending to acq.php
[20:26:08] <shoky> and it's serverside php problem
[20:26:38] <shoky> er actually nevermind that, sorry
[20:26:41] <`e> it's a string, I've tried echoing the string from the php page
[20:27:09] <`e> and it's correct, it's successfully stripped and put into an array etc...
[20:27:59] <shoky> but anyway, the problem is serverside - acq.php is not responding
[20:28:22] <shoky> and then that makes other requests not respond either
[20:28:37] <`e> mh the entire server is not responding now
[20:28:39] <`e> wait
[20:29:05] <shoky> ##php would be a better bet probably
[20:29:42] <`e> I tried just to send back a "1" from php
[20:30:46] <shoky> fix your server shit ;p
[20:30:48] <`e> nothing changed, it's a delegation problem, i don't know, but it's javascript... It keep the ajax request open, and even if I set the timeout it makes the sidebar useless
[20:31:09] <shoky> i doubt its a delegation/javascript problem
[20:31:22] <`e> I'm just working on it, not my server :)
[20:31:22] <shoky> delegation has nothing to do with ajax
[20:31:36] <shoky> still, the problem is serverside most likely
[20:31:46] <shoky> whoever's server it is
[20:31:55] <`e> hope it's a postgres problem.
[20:32:19] <`e> lol the whole system crashed...
[20:32:30] <shoky> nice
[20:32:39] <`e> bah, i'll go to bed, it's my birthday and sunday morning and I'm still awake.
[20:32:45] <`e> awesome.
[20:32:50] <shoky> good night & happy birthday
