[05:59:12] <andywww> hi, i have a contact form that pops up in a modal when a link is clicked, I'd like to pre-fill a hidden field with a value as soon as the element comes into existence, i have done this will success with d.on('ready'..) with the elements that exist on the page at the time it is rendered but I have not been able to get this to work for new elements that match the matcher that are injected
[05:59:26] <andywww> am i chasing my tail here or is it possible to do that?
[06:00:14] <andywww> i tried d.on('ready', 'myselector', function(){}) but that didn't seem to work
[06:14:02] <andywww> any ideas?
[07:02:39] <Uhkis> andywww: code speaks louder than words
[07:06:53] <andywww> ugh trust me it doesnt in this instance its an in house developed modal system
[07:07:05] <andywww> i'll broaden the question that might be easier
[07:08:16] <andywww> is it possible, without looping a timer, to assign an attribute value to an input element when the element doesn't exist in the dom yet?
[07:09:17] <andywww> an event that says something like for all existing and any future instances that match this selector, wether in the dom now or injected later, assign its value to X
[07:20:44] <Cork> andywww: there are no events for injected elements
[07:21:06] <Cork> ready is for when the original document is parsed to the end body tag, nothing else
[07:21:53] <andywww> flaps
[07:22:00] <andywww> okay, thanks
[07:22:22] <Cork> the closest you can get is https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[07:22:44] <Cork> though i don't think that is what your looking for, as it is for when an element get changes to its content
[07:22:53] <Cork> also it is quite messy
[07:26:17] <andywww> yeah thats looks pretty heavy
[07:26:24] <andywww> worth a bookmark though, thanks
[10:46:20] <rewrited> hello. I need to create some chained events in JS/jQuery. in summary I need that in case of clicking on an image, depending on the size of that image, the modal Bootstrap (v. 4.4.1) is displayed in some way. and consequently if the image has a different size, the modal must be displayed in another way. an important detail is that the image is displayed on an Owl Carousel (v. 2.3.4). I put everything in JSFiddle as similarly as possible:
[10:46:20] <rewrited> https://jsfiddle.net/rwtrecs/zqxnr02c/ - thank you very much for your attention and help!
[10:50:25] <Uhkis> rewrited: you forgot to describe the problem :D
[11:02:19] <rewrited> Uhkis: sorry.. one of the problems is that when you click on an image it is not always the same as it is displayed. the other problem is that when I change the image on the slider (with the arrows or dragg) it is not always being resized correctly.
[11:24:31] <Uhkis> rewrited: use width and height instead of max-width and max-height, that should fix your first problem if i understood is correctly
[11:40:37] <rewrited> Uhkis: ok.. this is a good idea. thanks! so.. do you have some idea for the second question?
[11:56:04] <Uhkis> rewrited: that probably requires event listener on the image change, if the slider has one
[11:58:05] <rewrited> Uhkis: yes, it has. and I can even recognize these events, but I am not able to create functions for the loop. the code is not dynamic. you know?
[12:02:12] <Uhkis> rewrited: show the image change listener code then
[12:03:30] <rewrited> Uhkis: can I paste the code here?
[12:03:59] <Uhkis> rewrited: never on irc, update the fiddle you linked earlier
[12:05:12] <rewrited> Uhkis: ok.. but it's already there. in JS line 36
[12:06:43] <Uhkis> rewrited: no, that's not the event i mean. i mean the even when user clicks the number or the next/prev button
[12:20:51] <rewrited> Uhkis: ok, understood. I will make the changes.thank you so much!
[16:48:17] <elfaks> Hello. I am trying to change my click handler to get the button clicked, go to its sibling comment form and unhide it. need help
[17:40:07] <robertmaxrees> elfaks got a fiddle?
[17:40:24] <elfaks> https://jsfiddle.net/31gLua8q/
[17:40:36] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:40:51] <robertmaxrees> can you share the actual HTML instead of whatever templating engine this is?
[17:44:16] <elfaks> I am using django i rendered a form into the page.
[17:44:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah - could you copy the HTML that's on the page, instead of the template syntax?
[17:44:35] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't speak django :)
[17:46:57] <elfaks> okay but what the code is doing is creating a comment form which is going to be attached to every entry created by a user. I am trying to access the specific instance of the form related to an entry but is only accessing the last form created by from the loop iteration
[17:47:39] <robertmaxrees> so the reason I'm asking for the actual HTML is because there are about 1000 ways to do this and i want to suggest the one that makes the most sense for this particular case.
[17:48:11] <robertmaxrees> it's often a bad idea to look for "sibling" elements because it's buggy and hard to fix.  there are other ways to accomplish similar things that make your life much easier and that prevent bugs :)
[17:48:34] <robertmaxrees> i also need to see the actual resultant html so i can see what our starting point is.
[17:50:58] <elfaks> okay ill send it
[17:51:01] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:51:50] <elfaks> https://jsfiddle.net/5hyk7t4m/
[17:53:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:53:26] <robertmaxrees> if i get a minute, i can try to work with you to whittle this down to the actual test case.
[17:53:39] <robertmaxrees> might be a while.  if you could make it just the form itself, that'd be rad.
[17:53:54] <elfaks> okay
[17:54:14] <robertmaxrees> (ie spend time to make an actual test case and i'll be much more inclined to help)
[18:03:58] <robertmaxrees> also i just took a look and none of the classnames in that snippet of js that you put in the css box exist in the html.
[18:19:22] <elfaks> That is the problem i need to understand js
[18:19:32] <robertmaxrees> okay, so then let's back up even further :)
[18:19:38] <robertmaxrees> have you visited learn.jquery.com?
[18:21:15] <elfaks> i see now that the forms were rendered with specific ids, i have now added those specific numbers to the respective button ids through the loop but i need to know how to handle the js script i will really appreciate your help.
[18:22:15] <robertmaxrees> well, your basic approach is fundamentally broken, for starters heh
[18:22:36] <elfaks> I agree
[18:22:40] <robertmaxrees> every time you add another click handler, it's adding another one to ALL elements.
[18:22:50] <robertmaxrees> so let's simplify down the html and make this easier to understand.
[18:23:10] <elfaks> okay
[18:23:32] <robertmaxrees> so what, you have a button that's showing/hiding a textbox basically?
[18:25:48] <robertmaxrees> elfaks ^
[18:26:03] <robertmaxrees> (it's fine if there's more to it than that, but we gotta solve one problem at a time - start simple :))
[18:27:37] <elfaks> okay i am trying to produce a simpler code snippet that consists of not more than two forms
[18:28:01] <elfaks> maybe it will be clearer.
[18:29:11] <robertmaxrees> something like https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/s4p3bwnL/1/  basically?
[18:37:16] <robertmaxrees> elfaks ^
[18:37:52] <elfaks> Except that the button should not be in the div and should be used to control the visibility of the div
[18:38:32] <robertmaxrees> okay - so i'm going to make a HUGE recommendation here - you want an element that wraps around both the button and its corresponding comment box.
[18:39:16] <robertmaxrees> relying on sibling selectors is a really bad idea.
[18:39:38] <elfaks> Okay.
[18:39:54] <robertmaxrees> so then you'd have something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8nk73bht/
[18:40:25] <elfaks> I need a way to use a js loop to increment the id numbers for each of the buttons and the div in the js file
[18:40:30] <robertmaxrees> why?
[18:40:55] <robertmaxrees> i thought you just needed to show/hide the corresponding comment form div?
[18:43:05] <elfaks> yes but in order to do that i need to add a specific number to the id or class of the element. (e.g comment-form-1, comment-form-2. and display-form-1, display-form-2, etc.) since the ids are of such formats
[18:43:14] <robertmaxrees> no you don't :)
[18:43:24] <robertmaxrees> you need to not repeat the js and use basic DOM traversal :)
[18:43:42] <elfaks> okay how do i do that?
[18:44:01] <robertmaxrees> hence the html change i just suggested.  get the js out of your template file and stick it in a js file, then pull that in at the top or bottom of the page.
[18:45:21] <elfaks> i have already done that
[18:45:56] <robertmaxrees> perfect.  so now, you want to bind a click handler to $('.show-comment-form');
[18:46:33] <robertmaxrees> from there, you can use closest() to find the .comment-block, and then .find() the .comment-form
[18:47:18] <elfaks> okay let me try
[18:47:37] <robertmaxrees> (you'll want to make sure you start with $(this) before you do the rest of your dom traversals, btw.
[18:50:03] <elfaks> how? can you please give an example code snippet?
[18:50:44] <robertmaxrees> well, you get the currently clicked button by using $(this).  you then run the .closest() method on it and pass it '.comment-block'
[18:52:08] <elfaks> is that before or after binding a click handler to $('show-comment-form')?
[18:52:18] <robertmaxrees> that's inside of the click handler.
[18:52:36] <robertmaxrees> $('.show-comment-form').on('click', function() { /* your code goes here */ });
[18:53:07] <robertmaxrees> the click handler is the function that runs when you click the button, and since the code is based on whatever button was current clicked, you need your logic to be in the handler :)
[18:54:17] <elfaks> okay. after that how do i use the find method?
[18:55:04] <robertmaxrees> in jquery, you can chain most methods together and keep going!  so you can just attach the find right onto the closest.
[18:56:23] <elfaks> okay. does it require the class name of the element i want to toggle?
[18:56:45] <elfaks> and where do i actually implement the toggle method?
[18:56:54] <robertmaxrees> again - method chaining :)
[18:57:06] <robertmaxrees> and yeah - just like how closest() goes "up" the tree to find the first element that matches your selector, .find() does the same thing.
[18:58:33] <elfaks> Still not working
[18:58:40] <robertmaxrees> save and share what you've got :)
[18:58:46] <elfaks> okay
[19:01:33] <elfaks> https://jsfiddle.net/2s80wmet/
[19:01:58] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:02:02] <robertmaxrees> so .closest() goes "up"
[19:02:31] <robertmaxrees> you want to use that to find that shared parent element - the .comment-block.
[19:02:40] <gnstaxo> how do i check if an element exists?
[19:02:50] <robertmaxrees> gnstaxo $('.foo').length
[19:03:23] <robertmaxrees> elfaks the idea being you start with the thing that was clicked, go up to the parent container for the "widget", then go down to the element you actually want.
[19:03:42] <gnstaxo> robertmaxrees: thank you
[19:04:28] <elfaks> i don't understand
[19:04:41] <elfaks> can you please show me what you mean?
[19:04:49] <robertmaxrees> elfaks what don't you understand?
[19:05:02] <robertmaxrees> the issue is if I just hand you the code, you don't actually learn how ot solve the problem :)
[19:05:24] <robertmaxrees> and like I said, right now you have .closest('div.comment-form'), when you want the .comment-block instead.
[19:06:39] <elfaks> in my code, the comment-form is what is meant by comment-block
[19:06:56] <robertmaxrees> what class is on the container for the input box?
[19:07:39] <robertmaxrees> since you're working off something i can't see, it's very difficult for me to give specific help :)
[19:08:11] <robertmaxrees> however, adopting your code to the fiddle i created, it would look like this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8nk73bht/8/
[19:11:14] <elfaks> please let me try studying how you accomplished this result and see how i can make it work in my case.
[19:11:28] <robertmaxrees> it'
[19:11:58] <robertmaxrees> *it's pretty basic - $(this).closest('.shared-parent-element').find('.the-element-you-want-to-toggle').toggle();
[19:14:39] <elfaks> It worked. Thank you so  much I really appreciate your generosity.
[19:14:56] <robertmaxrees> Do you feel like you better understand the basic idea?
[19:15:20] <elfaks> yes
[19:15:38] <robertmaxrees> perfect - that's the goal!
[19:15:51] <elfaks> now that you have shown it to me, it make complete sense.
[19:16:25] <elfaks> please can you provide me a good material i can learn from when i finish learning django?
[19:16:38] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com if you want to learn more jquery.
[19:16:43] <elfaks> Or rather try to learn them side by side
[19:16:55] <robertmaxrees> i mean, the jquery api docs are pretty killer.
[19:17:08] <robertmaxrees> but i'd start with the learn site - it'll give you the basics.
[19:17:29] <elfaks> okay
[19:17:53] <elfaks> but don't you think i will need a guide?
[19:18:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:18:08] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean by "a guide"?
[19:19:00] <elfaks> although i forgot i already have this wonderful channel.:]  thanks a Ton.
[19:19:26] <robertmaxrees> ...sure heh
[19:48:30] <gnstaxo> how do I append text to a textarea?
[19:49:11] <robertmaxrees> it's not super straightforward - get the text out into a var, append your text to that var, and then set the value to the new one.
[19:51:22] <robertmaxrees> *set the textarea value to the new string, that is.
[21:05:53] <linurandy> how could i execute a ajax request every 5 minutes
[21:06:06] <robertmaxrees> a recursive setTimeout call
[21:11:17] <linurandy> what the function?
[21:11:27] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[21:12:15] <linurandy> i don't understain
[21:12:22] <linurandy> sorry
[21:12:30] <robertmaxrees> what about it don't you understand? :)
[21:12:30] <linurandy> can you explain me please
[21:12:44] <linurandy> the function to execute my question
[21:12:51] <robertmaxrees> it's not a single function.
[21:12:52] <robertmaxrees> it's multiple.
[21:13:02] <linurandy> sorry for my language
[21:13:31] <robertmaxrees> you create one function to run the ajax call.  once that ajax call finishes, you use it to call setTimeout that then calls the function again.
[21:13:47] <linurandy> ahh
[21:15:17] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/5052661 something like this.
[21:22:37] <linurandy> thanks
