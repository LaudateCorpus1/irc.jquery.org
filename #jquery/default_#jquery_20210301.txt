[05:19:43] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: My car's making a funny noise. What might be causing it?
[15:47:30] <borisrunak> Hello!
[15:47:47] <robertmaxrees> hola
[15:48:19] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: my shower pressure is pretty lousy. How do I fix it?
[15:48:25] <robertmaxrees> Robdgreat lmao
[15:50:23] <borisrunak> How can I get the context change to the instance `this` when .done() https://paste.debian.net/1187407/ ?
[15:51:10] <robertmaxrees> borisrunak could .bind(this) on that function.
[15:51:26] <borisrunak> ok let me try robertmaxrees
[15:52:54] <borisrunak> $.get(...).done(...).bind is not a function
[15:52:58] <borisrunak> I must be stupid
[15:53:59] <robertmaxrees> the function inside the done.
[15:54:10] <robertmaxrees> .done(function() {}.bind(this));
[15:55:51] <borisrunak> let me try!
[15:58:50] <borisrunak> https://paste.debian.net/1187408/ , on line 11 `this` is undefined
[15:59:32] <robertmaxrees> how is get_artist getting called?
[16:02:12] <borisrunak> https://paste.debian.net/1187412/
[16:02:50] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  why isn't that post part of the class?
[16:03:36] <robertmaxrees> that's part of your issue.  you'd need to related.get_artists.call(related, related_artists); otherwise.
[16:04:46] <borisrunak> well I am trying to structure this so that it kind of makes sense where to find things
[16:04:54] <borisrunak> Obviously I failed üôÇ
[16:04:57] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:05:21] <robertmaxrees> i mean, tbh classes rarely make sense imho.  but if you want to use them, then you need to stick those methods all on the class.
[16:06:01] <borisrunak> well all these is because of the this.artists=[]
[16:06:17] <borisrunak> probably I have to make everything a function
[16:06:33] <borisrunak> could you please explain why this failed so badly ?
[16:06:35] <robertmaxrees> your other issue is you'll run into a race condition pretty quickly.
[16:06:54] <borisrunak> race condition, where?
[16:07:00] <robertmaxrees> this.artists = [];
[16:07:17] <robertmaxrees> but you're not doing anything to tell the calling function when that array will be populated with updated data.
[16:07:41] <robertmaxrees> is that .reset() just clearing that array?
[16:08:00] <borisrunak> yes sorry I forgot to include this
[16:08:23] <robertmaxrees> in that case, i would rethink this entirely :)
[16:08:46] <borisrunak> so any tips ‚ù§Ô∏è ?
[16:09:06] <robertmaxrees> first up: why are you .post()ing to the server and then .get()ing?
[16:10:21] <borisrunak> you mean why not .posting in either case?
[16:10:37] <borisrunak> or .getting maybe?
[16:10:39] <robertmaxrees> i mean why are you posting to the server and then getting from it for a search?
[16:10:47] <robertmaxrees> should just be a single get :)
[16:12:05] <borisrunak> I search for an artist , the server returns 20 similar artists. Then forEach of them I want the relevant data so I am getting them asynchronously
[16:12:49] <borisrunak> and as soon something returns , this should be pushed to related.artists
[16:13:07] <robertmaxrees> alright.  i'd swap that post to a get since you want to .get() that data.
[16:13:12] <robertmaxrees> as far as pushing to that array: whyfor?
[16:13:36] <borisrunak> Okay will do .
[16:15:13] <borisrunak> The pushing is to cache the data to the browser. I have two buttons then next, prev that populate some html elements on the DOM. There is an indexer keeping track of the current artist shown, and next ++ that indexer and related.artist[index].data are shown
[16:15:53] <borisrunak>  prev button -- decreases this indexer obviously
[16:16:02] <robertmaxrees> "cache the data to the browser"?  i feel like there's more to this than just showing some search results haha.
[16:17:32] <borisrunak> well instead of .getting on every next click, I did it so that the data are somewhere in memory. btw I am getting lastfm data (bio, images, tags)
[16:17:48] <robertmaxrees> so that array will just grow and grow??
[16:18:02] <borisrunak> no on every search there is a .reset()
[16:18:10] <robertmaxrees> then you don't need the array :)
[16:18:31] <borisrunak> what do you mean ?
[16:18:40] <robertmaxrees> how are you planning on displaying that data on click?
[16:19:11] <robertmaxrees> modals?  expanded cards?
[16:19:29] <borisrunak> bootstrap cards yes
[16:19:59] <borisrunak> https://paste.debian.net/1187424/
[16:20:03] <robertmaxrees> then just pop that into the dom and use a click handler to hhide/show that content.
[16:21:08] <borisrunak> how do I know what content to show ?
[16:21:14] <robertmaxrees> it's already in the page.
[16:21:25] <borisrunak> right now I am working with an indexer/array
[16:21:31] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to is what i'm saying :)
[16:22:01] <borisrunak> haha I understand that but I am not able to follow how ?
[16:22:17] <robertmaxrees> without seeing your planned UI, i'm not really clear on where you're lost lol.
[16:22:24] <borisrunak> please forgive my ignorance total noob with js / jquery
[16:22:37] <robertmaxrees> like, are you going to have a grid of results and on click you'll show more info for a particular one??
[16:22:57] <borisrunak> ah ok I can give you a screenshot
[16:23:50] <borisrunak> https://imgur.com/EJX8RVE
[16:24:37] <robertmaxrees> waiting...
[16:24:56] <borisrunak> so you enter an artist name, hit search and then on the About section the Artist image / bio should be displayed, and Top tracks table (on the right) populated
[16:26:01] <robertmaxrees> still not clear on why you need to shuttle around that array :) you can just pop the different artist info cards into the page, hide them, and then show the right one when a user clicks on a track.
[16:26:02] <borisrunak> when next is clicked on the About section, all the above should be updated with the next Artist you got from the server
[16:26:13] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, just fetch that information when a user clicks a track.
[16:26:32] <borisrunak> ok my bad I didn't explain the track list
[16:27:05] <borisrunak> so the track list is only for the current Artist displayed
[16:27:09] <robertmaxrees> nono i know.
[16:27:12] <robertmaxrees> iget the ui now.
[16:27:17] <borisrunak> ok
[16:27:24] <robertmaxrees> the next/previous can just get the next/previous item in the UI and then find the corresponding artist.
[16:27:38] <robertmaxrees> this is nice because then you can also let the user just click on the track and use the same logit.
[16:27:48] <robertmaxrees> *logic.  slightly easier to manage that abstraction overall.
[16:29:19] <borisrunak> " get the next/previous item in the UI" ... how do you iterate over items of in the UI . I mean you told me to pop them into the dom. Please where exactly ?
[16:29:40] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[16:29:42] <borisrunak> (maybe I am tired ‚òπÔ∏è )
[16:37:14] <robertmaxrees> so for starters: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ak5wf4c3/
[16:40:29] <borisrunak> hmm, I think I couldn't explain to you my idea
[16:40:34] <robertmaxrees> sec.
[16:40:42] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting the previous/next going for you ;)
[16:40:51] <borisrunak> ok ‚ù§Ô∏è
[16:41:33] <robertmaxrees> do you get the basic idea though?
[16:41:45] <borisrunak> btw foo, bar, baz will always be from the same artist
[16:41:51] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[16:41:59] <robertmaxrees> you can set those data attributes to whatever criteria you want.
[16:42:19] <robertmaxrees> just showing you an abstraction later.  this is just a demonstration of the concept.
[16:42:45] <borisrunak> so previous next should change this tracklist according to the artist displayed along with the artist info
[16:43:04] <robertmaxrees> again
[16:43:10] <robertmaxrees> just showing you an abstraction :)
[16:43:24] <robertmaxrees> wait a sec - so "previous/next" isn't for tracks, but for artists?
[16:43:33] <borisrunak> yeap
[16:43:38] <robertmaxrees> :
[16:43:43] <robertmaxrees> the UI doesn't make that very clear :/
[16:44:35] <borisrunak> still your idea is to make create a span for each artist you get from the server ?
[16:44:37] <robertmaxrees> why not also show the user a list of artists?
[16:45:04] <robertmaxrees> if you're not displaying the artists, then you'll need to come up with a different abstraction.
[16:45:17] <borisrunak> yeah was thinking of it at first but then wanted to keep it as minimal as possible
[16:45:36] <robertmaxrees> the problem with minimal in this case is that previous/next look like they're attached to the track list.
[16:45:45] <borisrunak> I always show one artist at the time with image,bio, tags, tracklist
[16:46:12] <robertmaxrees> at the bare minimum, labeling them with "previous artist" and "next artist" would be arguably better.
[16:46:35] <robertmaxrees> though i'd argue adding a list of artists might be a better bet overall.  your site though :)
[16:46:35] <borisrunak> there are two next/previous one for artist , one for tracklist (pagination on the table)
[16:47:08] <borisrunak> well its a simple experiment
[16:47:26] <borisrunak> haven't finalized it yet so I am open for ideas ‚ù§Ô∏è
[16:47:32] <robertmaxrees> erm.  so the previous/next in the screenshot you sent me would be for artists??
[16:48:29] <borisrunak> https://imgur.com/a/IB8HGKA
[16:49:27] <robertmaxrees> image removed?
[16:50:11] <robertmaxrees> ah required me to sign in.
[16:50:18] <borisrunak> ok
[16:50:23] <robertmaxrees> so "about" is for "about the artist"?
[16:50:26] <borisrunak> why though üòÄ
[16:50:38] <borisrunak> yes
[16:50:47] <borisrunak> about the artist
[16:51:06] <robertmaxrees> 'cause those previous/next buttons still are kind of vague.  will that box show anything other than info about the artist?
[16:51:34] <robertmaxrees> like the current track?
[16:51:52] <borisrunak> https://imgur.com/a/5kJP8iq
[16:52:07] <borisrunak> this is a screenshot before I broke it üôÇ
[16:52:33] <borisrunak> tried to show it to a friend of mine
[16:52:49] <robertmaxrees> aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh.
[16:53:08] <robertmaxrees> this screenshot is MUCH clearer about what you're intending with the track list.
[16:53:32] <borisrunak> you are right though , next/prev (for artist) should be somewhere else though
[16:54:00] <robertmaxrees> in that context, "next" is still a little vague.  your array concept from earlier is probably your best bet, though the UI makes it kind of confusing.  i'd have a list of artists or clearly label the button with "next artist: so and so", "previous artist: this other person" or something along those lines.
[16:54:29] <borisrunak> maybe below the whole "Related" region
[16:55:00] <borisrunak> yes maybe next artist/ previous artist
[16:55:01] <robertmaxrees> that wouldn't really help since it's not clear to the user what will happen when they click "next".
[16:55:32] <borisrunak> well I have to think about it you re definitely right
[16:55:50] <borisrunak> and of course your comments are most welcome
[16:56:18] <borisrunak> however I am still confused why I can't access the class method on .done()
[16:56:18] <robertmaxrees> either way - instead of storing active array index, you could render out the artist name in a data attribute somewhere, then build logic that finds that particular index and goes to the next.
[16:56:37] <robertmaxrees> because you're mixing and matching the object :) most that .get() for the search to be part of the class.
[16:57:32] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this for a general breakdown - "In most cases, the value of this is determined by how a function is called [...]" is the basic explanation
[16:57:35] <borisrunak> well everything related to clicks and user interaction in general are on one single file
[16:58:31] <robertmaxrees> see prior comment :)
[16:59:01] <borisrunak> you mean that this is determined by how a function is called
[16:59:18] <robertmaxrees> correct.  you'll need to read the full page to get a real understanding.
[17:00:10] <borisrunak> but what I 've done is considered anti-pattern or do I have just to apply this correctly ?
[17:01:21] <robertmaxrees> it's an anti-pattern if you have part of your logic in the class and part of it outside.
[17:03:05] <borisrunak> you re right
[17:03:16] <borisrunak> let me put this inside the class to see how this comes out
[17:03:29] <robertmaxrees> and also read that MDN page :)
[17:03:40] <robertmaxrees> since the topic of 'this' is an important one.
[17:03:53] <borisrunak> yes but now I am really tired to learn üôÇ
[17:04:06] <borisrunak> I bet it is..
[17:04:23] <robertmaxrees> "i'm too tired to learn so i'd rather spend more time trying random things instead" ;)
[17:08:21] <borisrunak> yeah kind of
[17:08:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:14:49] <borisrunak> well https://paste.debian.net/1187435/ , this.get_artists is not a function . I was really hoping that this would work
[17:15:26] <robertmaxrees> because 'this' inside that callback isn't the class.
[17:16:26] <borisrunak> yes it's the Request again
[17:16:41] <robertmaxrees> either need to use a fat arrow (which you should have since you're using `class`), store 'this' in a favor before you call the $.post(), or bind the callback itself.
[17:16:54] <robertmaxrees> this.get_artists(related_artists).bind(this); you won't need to bind this once you get the call correct.
[17:17:30] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax().then(() => {/* your code here */})
[17:18:28] <borisrunak> k let me try
[17:22:03] <robertmaxrees> something like https://paste.debian.net/1187438/
[17:22:16] <robertmaxrees> also if you're using classes, why not const/let?
[17:23:18] <borisrunak> you tell me haha
[17:23:21] <borisrunak> cause I noob
[17:23:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:24:24] <robertmaxrees> are you just not familiar with them?
[17:24:27] <borisrunak> I am sarcastic to myself trying to cover up my ignorance
[17:24:39] <borisrunak> yeah I know they exist, don't know how they work
[17:25:07] <robertmaxrees> slightly different (and generally better) scoping rules.  const for values that won't change.  let for ones that will.
[17:25:19] <robertmaxrees> (a little more complex than that, but you get the idea)
[17:25:20] <borisrunak> I should also change the .get to ajax right ?
[17:25:44] <borisrunak> yes will check them out too
[17:25:45] <robertmaxrees> i tend to favor things like .on() and .ajax() over the convenience methods.
[17:26:28] <borisrunak> Uncaught TypeError: this.add_related_artist is not a function , so I suppose its the same issue with the post ?/
[17:26:32] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/README.md i'd give this series a read.  and/or eloquent javascript.  lots of good resources available.
[17:26:50] <borisrunak> wow
[17:27:09] <borisrunak> starred
[17:27:09] <robertmaxrees> show me your latest code?
[17:27:57] <borisrunak> https://paste.debian.net/1187440/
[17:28:55] <robertmaxrees> guessing you still haven't read that MDN article about 'this'? :/
[17:29:45] <borisrunak> I completely rely on you at the moment
[17:29:49] <robertmaxrees> :/
[17:30:00] <robertmaxrees> go read that article and some basics heh.
[17:30:08] <borisrunak> But hey, you already helped me so much !
[17:30:33] <borisrunak> will do robertmaxrees
[17:33:32] <robertmaxrees> borisrunak fwiw: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/szfc0vg9/
[17:33:42] <robertmaxrees> ;)  now go read some tutorials and learn some js!
[17:35:10] <borisrunak> really really appreciate your help here !!
[17:35:43] <borisrunak> will take some sleep now , and will continue tomorrow
[17:35:54] <borisrunak> really appreciate your efforts
[22:16:43] <Samian> hi
[22:17:01] <robertmaxrees> hello
[22:17:55] <Samian> is there an offtopic channel associated with this channel?
[22:17:59] <Samian> I have an off topic question
[22:18:17] <robertmaxrees> there is, but not a lot of people use it.  what's the question about?
[22:19:20] <Samian> I'm looking for people with loose morals. folks who've hacked others, use warez, and likely don't mind cheating to get ahead.
[22:19:53] <robertmaxrees> i dunno that the offtopic channel would be a good place for that...
[22:20:23] <Samian> I thought i might find people like that in #bitcoin
[22:20:38] <robertmaxrees> why are you looking for "people like that"?
[22:20:54] <Samian> I prefer to not disclose that
[22:21:04] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:21:34] <robertmaxrees> good luck on your hunt!
[22:23:43] <Samian> thanks...
[22:24:23] <robertmaxrees> (if you're looking for help exploiting systems or w/e, even the offtopic channel would really be a good place for that fwiw)
[22:25:02] <robertmaxrees> *wouldn't, rather
