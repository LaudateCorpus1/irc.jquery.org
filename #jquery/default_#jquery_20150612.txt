[00:08:37] <JosefDe> I'm desperate..
[00:21:27] <Uhkis> lashing out to someone who's trying to help you will not get there faster
[00:24:16] <JosefDe> I'm sorry about that.
[00:24:24] <JosefDe> Sometimes I'm too rude
[00:24:27] <JosefDe> I know
[00:24:54] <JosefDe> But it upsets me that it is so unnecessarily difficult to just simply find out, if an <span>-item has the new focus..
[00:25:20] <JosefDe> It's a very very simple task, but it costs me lots of time
[00:25:46] <arc_> can you link the page you're working on
[00:26:36] <arc_> the problem is that under normal circumstances, only interactive objects get focus. if none have focus, the page has focus
[00:26:38] <JosefDe> arc_: At the moment I'm doing a business call (time pressure). Then I'll post the link to the code. Maybe someone knows  a simple solution.
[00:27:02] <JosefDe> arc_: Exactly. If I check whether <span> has focus, I get always false. And the focus is always on <body>
[00:27:44] <arc_> without seeing your code, i can't understand from your explanation why you are trying to see if a span has focus
[00:29:58] <JosefDe> arc_: I understand you. I'll post code after my call, promise. I'm trying to see if <span> has focus because: 1) On focusout of the search-input-field I hide the search-input-field. 2) I want to put the value of the selected span (=Item of the search-result)  into the search-field. But the problem is: The click event on  the span doesn't work anymo
[00:29:58] <JosefDe> re, because there is no <span> shown anymore, it's hidden. Therefore the click-event for the <span> doesn't trigger
[00:30:17] <JosefDe> 1) I mean I'm hiding the search-result-list
[00:31:59] <JosefDe> arc_: Therefore I'm trying to find out, if <span> has new focus, to turn off hide() inside my focus-event-handler, so that the click-event on the <span> works
[00:32:31] <JosefDe> arc_: And inside the click-event-handler for the <span> I then get the value of the <span> and hide() the menu
[00:32:54] <JosefDe> arc_: That simple, but that difficult :)
[00:33:45] <arc_> instead of hiding when the input loses focus, just do this
[00:33:51] <arc_> $(document).on('click', function() { if ($(this).hasClass('yourDropdownClass') { return; } else { $('.yourDropdownClass').hide(); }
[00:34:12] <arc_> may be a syntax error there, i don't normally edit code in the irc editbox..
[00:34:33] <JosefDe> arc_: The problem is, that the click-event doesn't trigger, because focusout-event is triggered earlier, which already hides the menu
[00:34:48] <arc_> i'm saying don't hide the menu on focusout
[00:35:09] <JosefDe> arc_: Then we have the problem, that it isn't hidden if I click into another input-field or to <body>..
[00:35:27] <arc_> ok
[00:35:31] <JosefDe> :D
[00:35:37] <JosefDe> You see my dilemma..
[00:41:08] <JosefDe> It looks like <span> can't get focus
[00:41:20] <arc_> why is it specifically span
[00:41:26] <arc_> isn't it any element anywhere on the page
[00:41:33] <JosefDe> Because I'm getting html-result via json
[00:41:45] <arup_r> Say I have some links like <a href="/questons/3">124dr</a>, <a href="/questons/4">124dr</a>, <a href="/questons/8">124dr</a> etc etc I want once someone click the url... question url becomes like as an example "http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html#method-i-25" Please let me know if you didn't get me
[00:42:09] <JosefDe> arc_: Yes it is an element on the page
[00:42:28] <arc_> that's not what i was asking. anyway, if you just need specific spans to be able to get focus, refer to this:
[00:42:29] <arc_> [01:59:06] <arc_> In recent browser versions, the event can be extended to include all element types by explicitly setting the element's tabindex property.
[00:43:13] <arc_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex
[00:43:50] <arc_> if a span has a tabindex element, it will be able to get focus
[00:44:05] <JosefDe> arc_: How can I do that?
[00:44:17] <arc_> attribute, not element
[00:44:19] <JosefDe> ah its an attribute
[00:44:20] <JosefDe> ok
[00:44:21] <arc_> <span tabindex="#">
[00:44:37] <JosefDe> aha. I try that out know
[00:44:53] <JosefDe> So kan I use "#" for all elements?
[00:44:55] <arc_> refer to that page to see what a negative/0/positive value will do
[00:45:23] <arc_> it depends. do you want people to be able to reach the elements via keyboard navigation?
[00:45:43] <JosefDe> no
[00:45:49] <arc_> then just use -1 for all values
[00:54:18] <arc_> http://jsfiddle.net/b3ah82d6/2/
[00:54:20] <arc_> here you can see this working
[01:07:04] <alea123> anyone has a hint how to check if the value in an input-field is an integer value and only integer? without 1.00 or something like that
[01:08:02] <Uhkis> not 100% but i think those are always strings
[01:10:35] <alea123> http://pastebin.com/wQ0jQX1E .. i want that the user only types "1" or "2" and not "1.00" or "1,00"
[01:11:48] <JosefDe> arc_: Still doesn't work :(
[01:13:05] <Uhkis> alea123: value.match(/[0-9]*/) should work
[01:13:09] <JosefDe> Who can help me?
[01:13:46] <Uhkis> no one, unless you provide enough info (code etc)
[01:13:46] <arc_> without seeing any of your code, it's essentially impossible
[01:14:19] <JosefDe> arc_: Can I show you my code?
[01:14:35] <arc_> by linking to the site you're working on or a fiddle, hopefully
[01:15:34] <JosefDe> arc_: Ok. Wait a second please.
[01:19:45] <alea123> Uhkis: thanks!
[01:26:39] <JosefDe> arc_: I'm pasting it
[01:28:45] <JosefDe> arc_: https://jsfiddle.net/6s2z971a/6/
[01:29:04] <JosefDe> arc_: Wait
[01:29:06] <JosefDe> arc_: https://jsfiddle.net/6s2z971a/7/
[01:29:31] <JosefDe> arc_: Are you online?
[01:29:46] <arc_> yes
[01:30:11] <arc_> can you put the css so i can actually see it
[01:32:57] <JosefDe> arc_: Sorry lost connection
[01:33:16] <arc_> ok. did you get this [04:30:02] <arc_> can you put the css so i can actually see it
[01:34:08] <arc_> i suppose the problem with this is that i cannot get ajax results and therefore i cannot see the dropdown
[01:34:14] <JosefDe> arc_: https://jsfiddle.net/6s2z971a/10/
[01:35:06] <JosefDe> I'm under time pressure and desparate. Don't know how to fix this
[01:39:58] <arc_> JosefDe ok wrap the whole input/results in a div and change line 29 from jQuery.(this) to jQuery.('select the wrapper div')
[01:40:41] <arc_> there may already be an appropriate container to select for this, but i don't know that because i can't see all of the html
[01:41:01] <JosefDe> arc_: Can you change my jsfiddle and give me the link?
[01:41:18] <arc_> i guess, but i might be adding inappropriate html
[01:42:16] <JosefDe> arc_: The parent in which the table is, is a div
[01:42:27] <arc_> https://jsfiddle.net/6s2z971a/11/
[01:42:29] <runtyrobot> I have an element, where I have the hover image stored as a data tag - this snippet works - but is there a way to write it simpler? http://pastebin.com/7ZdQKTVk
[01:42:50] <arc_> also, you don't need to do .addClass('hidden'); . you can just do .hide();
[01:43:25] <JosefDe> arc_: Let me try this
[01:43:29] <arc_> ok
[01:43:38] <JosefDe> arc_: Hopefully it works. Then I would be really really relieved..
[01:43:53] <arc_> oh, you might need to add tabindex="-1" to the container div
[01:44:34] <JosefDe> arc_: Does this also work with <section> instead of <div>?
[01:45:02] <arc_> i honestly don't know
[01:45:15] <arc_> i would think it would
[01:45:19] <JosefDe> ok
[01:47:20] <arc_> wait, you don't need the if statement anymore if that works
[01:48:23] <JosefDe> ok
[01:48:33] <JosefDe> I'm excited :)
[01:49:34] <arc_> is there a reason you can't link the site you're working on
[01:50:09] <JosefDe> arc_: Because it's a real life project
[01:50:20] <arc_> k..
[01:51:01] <cuoreDjo> hey, i want to know if i can make a table in a sfecific web page that  extract his data from that web page and note that those data are refreshable and not static
[01:51:05] <Uhkis> lol
[01:56:38] <JosefDe> arc_: Didn't fix the problem
[01:56:58] <JosefDe> arc_: It recognizes focusout, but still doesn't know if <span> was clicked
[01:57:19] <arc_> wait. so now it doesn't hide when you click on the results?
[01:58:37] <arc_> ok i need to hide join/part/quit in this channel
[01:58:51] <JosefDe> oh wait..
[01:59:12] <JosefDe> no :(
[01:59:15] <JosefDe> it doesn't work
[01:59:29] <arc_> ok, then i need to verify that you did everything since i can't just look for myself
[01:59:52] <arc_> is there an issue with using a wrapper div instead of using section
[02:00:25] <arc_> actually, can you update the fiddle with all of the relevant html
[02:00:37] <arc_> instead of only the search box and results div
[02:00:59] <arc_> results "section"
[02:01:14] <JosefDe> I'm using div as you told me. But it doesn't recognize, that I selected tr
[02:01:57] <arc_> ...
[02:02:08] <arc_> please answer the following with yes or no
[02:02:21] <arc_> do you want the results to hide when you click on them or not
[02:03:37] <JosefDe> arc_: yes
[02:03:41] <arc_> ok. are they?
[02:04:03] <JosefDe> arc_: no
[02:04:04] <arc_> no, because it doesn't recognize the click
[02:04:06] <arc_> ok. that is a separate issue
[02:04:28] <arc_> the problem is that the elements you are trying to click on do not exist in the dom when the jquery script ran
[02:04:35] <arc_> you need to use a delegated event handler
[02:04:41] <JosefDe> arc_: Exactly :)
[02:04:51] <arc_> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[02:05:48] <arc_> a handler written this way will attach to a parent element and will fire for any descendants that match, even if they are created after the script runs
[02:06:47] <JosefDe> arc_: Mhh.. Hopefully I get this running. Ok I try to understand it
[02:07:05] <arc_> so if the suggestion results are all table rows contained in a table, you will attach the delegated handler to the table
[02:07:12] <arc_> and filter by tr
[02:07:25] <arc_> do you understand what i mean?
[02:07:28] <JosefDe> No :(
[02:07:54] <arc_> you cannot attach an event handler to an element that doesn't exist when the script runs
[02:08:06] <JosefDe> arc_: Yes, correct
[02:08:09] <arc_> so you have to attach it to an element that does exist, above the ones that will be added later
[02:08:32] <arc_> i assume the trs have a parent table element?
[02:08:38] <JosefDe> arc_: Correct
[02:08:48] <arc_> so you will do something like
[02:09:07] <arc_> $( "table.yourClass" ).on( "click", "tr", function( event ) { ... });
[02:09:34] <arc_> so inside the table, when a tr is clicked, the event is fired
[02:09:41] <JosefDe> But the table is also hidden
[02:09:57] <arc_> whether it's hidden is irrelevant
[02:10:01] <arc_> does the table exist in the dom when the script runs?
[02:10:16] <JosefDe> let me have a look
[02:10:48] <JosefDe> No. Only the parent <section> exists
[02:11:10] <arc_> ok ... that's strange but i don't have time to go through changing that
[02:11:26] <arc_> use the section in the initial selector then
[02:11:36] <Macaveli> I have a variable in the window behind the popup, is it possible to access that window?
[02:11:38] <JosefDe> ok. I try that out now
[02:14:36] <JosefDe> arc_: Your last suggestion won't fix the problem. We have still the same problem, that the focusout event is triggered before the click-event..
[02:15:54] <arc_> well, you still have to do it or it won't work regardless
[02:16:24] <arc_> event delegation is a requirement for dynamically added interactions
[02:17:49] <arc_> how about you check whether the results are being hovered over before hiding it
[02:18:00] <arc_> then you will have to also hide it on click
[02:18:40] <JosefDe> We have so many workarounds now, and nothing works :)
[02:18:47] <JosefDe> The same result as at the beginning
[02:19:07] <arc_> event delegation is not a workaround, it's the only possible way to do it
[02:19:25] <JosefDe> Yes. And everything we tried before is > /dev/null :)
[02:19:36] <arc_> not really
[02:21:41] <arc_> but since i can't see progress on what you've done or most of your real code, it's hard for me to know the status
[02:22:09] <arc_> now that i think about it, i think checking whether the cursor is over the results before you hide it is probably the best solution
[02:22:13] <JosefDe> *sigh*
[02:22:35] <JosefDe> arc_: that doesn't make sense. hover doesn't mean that he clicked an item..
[02:22:57] <arc_> it doesn't matter.. it's two separate events
[02:23:08] <arc_> on focusout, if hovered, don't hide
[02:23:14] <arc_> then when you click, it will work
[02:24:01] <JosefDe> arc_: And then we still have the same problem: The focusout event is triggered before hover..
[02:24:13] <JosefDe> arc_: So that's no solution..
[02:24:17] <arc_> what? no
[02:24:22] <arc_> if it's hovering, focusout won't do anything
[02:24:24] <arc_> that's the entire point
[02:24:28] <JosefDe> hä?
[02:24:39] <JosefDe> So I have to check if tr is hovered?
[02:25:02] <arc_> yes
[02:25:06] <JosefDe> mhh..
[02:25:22] <JosefDe> I do this check in the focusout-event-handler?
[02:25:40] <arc_> yes. instead of the if (tr is being clicked)
[02:26:02] <JosefDe> let me try
[02:27:53] <sebb_> hey ! Can I somehow iterate with jquery through all lines in my css file ? And find values that i want to replace ?
[02:28:08] <arc_> i .. don't think so
[02:28:32] <JosefDe> mhh. "unsupported pseudo: hover". Let's see if there is a workaround
[02:28:34] <arc_> you can only edit css that is part of the html dom
[02:29:08] <arc_> JosefDe if ($('yourSelector' + ':hover').length)
[02:29:18] <asido> I have a weird problem - when an iframe internally executes $('body').show(), it freezes IE11. any idea why this could happen?
[02:29:20] <sebb_> arc_, Is there no way to get my css file to a var and then iterate through all lines ?
[02:29:27] <arc_> no there is not
[02:29:54] <sebb_> arc_, So what to do if I return to my dom some values that I want to update in my css file ? whats's the solution ?
[02:30:26] <JosefDe> arc_: It says "Syntax error, unrecognized expression: unsupported pseudo: hover"
[02:30:27] <sebb_> I don't want to check all elements I want to change one thing in my css file, so my objects update's automaticaly
[02:30:40] <arc_> .css() will change the values
[02:30:50] <sebb_> of one element
[02:31:04] <arc_> what version of jquery JosefDe
[02:31:30] <sebb_> But I have decalaration of that color in couple of spots in my file. So I cannot realy specify which value I want to update
[02:32:56] <arc_> sounds like you want to use a color picker to change the value of a color in a class?
[02:33:56] <JosefDe> arc_: 1.11.1
[02:37:44] <arc_> it works for me
[02:40:30] <JosefDe> arc_: The problem is that the selector isn't existing if it is hidden
[02:41:00] <arc_> you can select hidden elements.
[02:41:15] <arc_> how else would you show them?
[02:47:45] <JosefDe> Yes!!!!
[02:47:56] <JosefDe> arc_: You saved my day!!!!
[02:48:15] <arc_> you have no idea how relieved i am to hear that
[02:48:34] <arc_> i was in the middle of making a simplified example in jsfiddle to show you how it's supposed to be
[02:49:35] <Uhkis> and now JosefDe can finally cash in with your code :-)
[02:50:04] <arc_> heh
[02:51:56] <tofra> I have a problem with eventing, using jQuery. Can you check my example: https://jsfiddle.net/rLu0f1dz/2
[02:53:16] <tofra> Basically I need to be able to trigger a "global" event, and the Objects I create should be able to listen to them if needed. When the Object is destroyed, it should not listen anymore ofcourse.
[02:53:23] <tofra> What am I doing wrong?
[02:54:22] <arc_> JosefDe in case you run into something you didn't notice, here is my example https://jsfiddle.net/2LL3fsvy/1/
[02:56:04] <flobin> so in jquery, I can use scrollTop to scroll to something, like an anchor link
[02:56:14] <flobin> and then use window.location.hash to add that anchor link to the URL
[02:56:20] <stefanocerelli> +yes
[02:56:45] <flobin> now if someone loads domain.com/#anchor, what should I use to make sure the person lands at the anchor?
[02:57:29] <stefanocerelli> if you land directly
[02:57:31] <stefanocerelli> on it
[02:57:34] <stefanocerelli> the hash is enoguh
[02:57:42] <stefanocerelli> make
[02:57:58] <stefanocerelli> sure that the section have an id and the hash must be the id
[02:58:48] <flobin> hmm
[02:59:02] <stefanocerelli> so <div id="page"></div> url.com/#page
[02:59:59] <arc_> i forgot about the focusout so here's that https://jsfiddle.net/2LL3fsvy/2/
[03:01:12] <flobin> I don’t think it’s working, though: http://cool-house.nl/index.php#Omgeving
[03:01:34] <flobin> oh I guess it is
[03:01:39] <flobin> thanks stefanocerelli
[03:02:34] <stefanocerelli> wrong anchor
[03:02:37] <stefanocerelli> http://cool-house.nl/index.php#0mgeving
[03:02:39] <stefanocerelli> it's a 0
[03:02:40] <stefanocerelli> non a o
[03:02:43] <stefanocerelli> not a o
[03:03:24] <stefanocerelli> or not, just replace the O with o for me it's working well
[03:04:07] <stefanocerelli> there is some problems, btw, on this site
[03:04:39] <flobin> stefanocerelli: which problems do you mean?
[03:04:55] <stefanocerelli> i think it's me, it never stop loading
[03:05:13] <stefanocerelli> the page. But i think is just for me
[03:05:27] <flobin> yeah I need to do some optimization, it’s probably not just you
[03:06:41] <arc_> it's very strange helping someone through a convoluted process when i can't see the resulting code at all. i have no idea whether all that was done properly or not, just that it now supposedly works
[03:07:25] <stefanocerelli> but the thing is
[03:07:29] <stefanocerelli> why use javascript
[03:07:36] <stefanocerelli> i the content s not load async??
[03:07:58] <stefanocerelli> you can just use id on a block element and use the hash to land directly on it
[03:10:51] <dylancole> Hey, I’m trying to fadeIn() a prepended div and it’s not working.
[03:11:12] <arc_> how are you triggering the fadein
[03:11:34] <dylancole> arc_: $('<div class="post"></div>').prependTo(feed).fadeIn("slow");
[03:11:59] <arc_> so what happens
[03:12:06] <dylancole> It renders the div but it doesn’t fade
[03:12:08] <flobin> stefanocerelli: you talkin’ to me?
[03:12:26] <dylancole> I even tried hide(); before rendering and it doesn’t work
[03:12:40] <stefanocerelli> no to arc
[03:12:41] <dylancole> I tried the other way around with prepend(); still doesn’t work
[03:12:51] <arc_> i guess make the div hidden by default in css and put the fadein on a separate line
[03:13:13] <arc_> stefanocerelli if you're talking to me, i don't know what you're referring to
[03:13:28] <stefanocerelli> to the flobin problem
[03:13:36] <arc_> i was not part of that conversation at all
[03:13:46] <stefanocerelli> i couldn't figure out why u were tring to handle his problem with jquery
[03:13:52] <stefanocerelli> ahhh sry
[03:13:56] <arc_> np
[03:14:10] <flobin> stefanocerelli: well I didn’t know that you’d just land on the correct element already
[03:14:26] <dylancole> arc_: so the first line should be $().prependTo(element);
[03:14:30] <flobin> so I thought I had to use js, but I don’t, so that’s great
[03:14:38] <dylancole> then how can I select it to fadeIn?
[03:15:29] <stefanocerelli> $().prependTo(element); $(element).faseIn()
[03:15:51] <arc_> he's creating a div though
[03:15:52] <dylancole> I have to write the $() two times?
[03:15:55] <dylancole> Yea
[03:16:03] <dylancole> I’m creating a div on the fly
[03:16:11] <dylancole> It renders properly just doesn’t fadeIn when it renders
[03:16:11] <arc_> i'm not sure. can you create a fiddle
[03:16:19] <dylancole> arc_: http://codepen.io/taher_chi/full/QbgjVw/
[03:16:26] <dylancole> scroll down and press “view more"
[03:17:11] <arc_> ok, so you want the new post that comes up to fade in
[03:17:16] <dylancole> yes
[03:18:12] <arc_> i've never used codepen before. how would i rerun this or update it
[03:18:22] <dylancole> save it
[03:18:30] <dylancole> it’ll save a new post automatically as anon
[03:18:35] <dylancole> (i think)
[03:18:51] <arc_> i guess i have to fork it first since you own this
[03:18:56] <dylancole> yep
[03:21:44] <arc_> wow this site is kind of annoying with the constant updating
[03:21:56] <dylancole> yes, indeed
[03:22:13] <dylancole> I hate it too.
[03:22:20] <frank_o> sorry what site?
[03:22:25] <dylancole> codepen
[03:22:36] <frank_o> ah yeah !! true that
[03:22:41] <arc_> why do you use it then lol
[03:22:52] <frank_o> :)
[03:22:55] <dylancole> I’m a designer so I like the design of it lol
[03:23:05] <stefanocerelli> dude why just not use a switcher
[03:23:07] <frank_o> its very prutty
[03:23:10] <stefanocerelli> is so easy instead of use fadeIn
[03:23:12] <dylancole> fiddle has a 1990s interface
[03:23:20] <dylancole> JSBin is a little fancy
[03:23:32] <stefanocerelli> much heavy then a sempli transistion :opacity; opacity: 1;
[03:23:37] <dylancole> stefanocerelli switcher?
[03:23:42] <stefanocerelli> ye
[03:23:51] <dylancole> oh you mean just do opacity 1 and 0?
[03:23:51] <stefanocerelli> i do it for u give me a second
[03:24:09] <arc_> 1990's? idk about that. it basically looks like outlook
[03:24:23] <arc_> outlook.com not outlook the native application :p
[03:24:23] <frank_o> fiddle is my go-to testcaser
[03:24:28] <dylancole> stefanocerelli: remember that these posts are ajax calls. What you see in the codepen is a prototype.
[03:24:59] <stefanocerelli> it's the same
[03:25:01] <stefanocerelli> it's just css
[03:25:04] <dylancole> arc_: did you get it working? it’s wierd.
[03:25:32] <arc_> not yet
[03:25:38] <dylancole> stefanocerelli: so at one click of “view more” you’ll see at least 10 posts at once – opacity 0/1 can be feasible?
[03:26:19] <dylancole> stefanocerelli: the thing with opacity is you can only do fade in or out. What if I want it to slideIn or something?
[03:26:55] <arc_> i was able to select it with $('div.post').last()
[03:26:57] <arc_> but fading it in doesn't work
[03:27:04] <arc_> i can do other stuff to it
[03:27:11] <dylancole> such as?
[03:27:20] <arc_> i did addclass
[03:27:23] <dylancole> I think stefanocerelli approach is better I’d say.
[03:27:27] <arc_> just to make sure it was selecting the right thing
[03:27:38] <dylancole> arc_: https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/ – can we add those classes?
[03:27:42] <arc_> yes
[03:27:47] <arc_> so just do that
[03:27:53] <dylancole> stefanocerelli: https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/
[03:28:14] <dylancole> arc_: so what I do is when prepending I add a class or something?
[03:28:43] <frank_o> isn't animate.css obsolete in favor of https://github.com/h5bp/Effeckt.css/ ?
[03:28:58] <arc_> yeah just do addClass('fadein')
[03:28:59] <frank_o> not obsolete but.. surpassed maybe
[03:30:12] <arc_> wait wtf
[03:30:15] <arc_> why are you using prepend
[03:30:23] <arc_> the fading in class is appearing at the top
[03:30:32] <arc_> you want append
[03:30:41] <dylancole> append the div?
[03:31:15] <dylancole> wait, no, if I do append() it doesn’t spawn it
[03:31:26] <arc_> yeah it does, below the view more posts button
[03:31:30] <arc_> so move that outside of the main feed div
[03:31:46] <arc_> or prepend it to the view more posts button
[03:32:34] <arc_> er no sorry i'm tired. that last thing doesn't work
[03:32:40] <dylancole> yea lol
[03:32:48] <dylancole> it appends below the “view button"
[03:33:03] <arc_> why can't i edit the html
[03:34:46] <dylancole> JS is wierd. It doesn’t even addClas()
[03:37:56] <dylancole> arc_: whenever I click “view more” it adds a div.post only
[03:38:03] <dylancole> I can’t even add more classes to it. wtf?
[03:38:47] <stefanocerelli> dude
[03:38:49] <stefanocerelli> adjust
[03:38:52] <stefanocerelli> it by ur needs
[03:38:52] <stefanocerelli> http://codepen.io/v00d0/pen/WvOgmj
[03:39:26] <dylancole> am I suppose to see some animation?
[03:39:37] <arc_> the top box is the one that's fading in
[03:39:39] <stefanocerelli> ye i do
[03:39:39] <arc_> :p
[03:39:46] <stefanocerelli> u prepending
[03:39:49] <stefanocerelli> not appending
[03:39:50] <stefanocerelli> look up
[03:40:03] <stefanocerelli> prepend append before other post
[03:40:14] <stefanocerelli> so it's the first one that fade in not the last one
[03:41:18] <stefanocerelli> if you want to append the post then
[03:41:25] <stefanocerelli> it's an other story
[03:42:32] <arc_> i'm too tired to figure it out. how can he append to the posts, but before the view more button
[03:42:36] <dylancole> prepending renders before the post?
[03:42:45] <stefanocerelli> PREpend
[03:42:49] <stefanocerelli> so BEFOREpost
[03:42:53] <arc_> prepend inserts before the first content of the parent object
[03:43:04] <arc_> first element i guess i should say
[03:43:16] <stefanocerelli> to append
[03:43:20] <stefanocerelli> you have to do lik ethis
[03:43:26] <stefanocerelli> http://codepen.io/v00d0/pen/WvOgmj
[03:43:45] <arc_> there u go
[03:44:44] <dylancole> woah.
[03:44:46] <dylancole> nice!
[03:46:08] <arc_> so you moved the view more button outside the feed div, like i suggested
[03:46:17] <arc_> i was going to do that, but i couldn't figure out how to edit the html in this thing :p
[03:46:49] <stefanocerelli> ye it's jade
[03:47:02] <stefanocerelli> is like using emmet
[03:47:18] <tofra> Anyone here who know about eventing?
[03:47:43] <tofra> I have a problem with eventing, using jQuery. Can you check my example: https://jsfiddle.net/rLu0f1dz/2
[03:47:48] <tofra> Basically I need to be able to trigger a "global" event, and the Objects I create should be able to listen to them if needed. When the Object is destroyed, it should not listen anymore ofcourse.
[03:49:01] <stefanocerelli> why
[03:49:04] <arc_> tofra is your problem that you need events to fire on objects that do not exist when you run the script
[03:49:24] <dylancole> stefanocerelli: I want to use animate.css with this. Do I just replace classe?
[03:49:29] <stefanocerelli> don't you create a third obkect where you push the created one and then remove it when u complete the task u need to complete
[03:49:43] <stefanocerelli> ??
[03:50:17] <stefanocerelli> check
[03:50:23] <dylancole> wait, what?
[03:50:27] <stefanocerelli> dylancode: check wich class is needed to
[03:50:27] <dylancole> i’m confused
[03:50:32] <arc_> that wasn't to you
[03:50:40] <stefanocerelli> animate an element
[03:50:40] <dylancole> https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/
[03:50:54] <dylancole> fadeInUp
[03:51:19] <stefanocerelli> then
[03:51:33] <stefanocerelli> add both class
[03:51:43] <dylancole> both class?
[03:51:44] <tofra> arc_ I'm not exactly sure what you mean..
[03:52:09] <dylancole> stefanocerelli: $('body .fadingIn').fadeIn("slow", function(  - why are you doing this?
[03:52:21] <stefanocerelli> ye but u don't need
[03:52:22] <stefanocerelli> to
[03:52:29] <stefanocerelli> fadeIn
[03:52:31] <arc_> do you need to bind events to objects that you are creating with jquery
[03:52:34] <stefanocerelli> with jquery if you use animate
[03:53:03] <stefanocerelli> brb
[03:53:19] <dylancole> stefanocerelli: so I just add/remove the class?
[03:53:35] <arc_> tofra i don't understand the functionality of this fiddle whatsoever
[03:54:39] <arc_> sry i think this might be above my head when i haven't slept in 20+ hours
[03:54:44] <arc_> good night
[04:03:22] <tofra> arc_ hehe, ok! sleep well!
[05:14:42] <foofoobar> Hi. <div id=„foo“><i class=„fa fa-bar“></i> this is xyz <span>12:23</span></div>. I want to get only the „this is xyz“ from this element, how can I do this ?
[05:17:26] <Cork> foofoobar: grab $(parent).html() and regex remove the content you don't want
[05:17:41] <Cork> foofoobar: dom doens't provide a way to grab text only elements
[05:18:01] <decx> if it's always the same sturcture you can grab the textNode
[05:18:01] <blinky_> Hi all,  I am using this script to blink a red bar across a page, it works fine, however, in Chrome the flashing does not keep time and ends up flashing really quick and stuttering for want of a better description, any ideas? - http://jsfiddle.net/hbf4x3oz/
[05:18:19] <Cork> decx: sure, but that would be node not dom
[05:18:40] <decx> just saying that contents() could grad it
[05:18:42] <decx> grab
[05:19:47] <foofoobar> Cork, decx: I just found this which works: http://viralpatel.net/blogs/jquery-get-text-element-without-child-element/
[05:20:33] <Cork> foofoobar: that is quite a bit heavier then doing the regex solution
[05:20:34] <decx> if you don't mind cloning stuff sure
[05:20:46] <decx> yeah grab html and regex the stuff between > and <
[05:20:48] <foofoobar> It’s just for a single element so I think its okay
[05:20:53] <Cork> foofoobar: also the the best option is to wrap the text you want to access in it's own element
[05:21:01] <decx> that would be the best
[05:21:13] <Cork> *its
[05:21:38] <decx> also you dont need to attach a function like this to $ that's just a chain
[05:22:29] <foofoobar> ok
[05:25:25] <taplar> i agree with the wrapping, but you could also do http://jsfiddle.net/zyu8tgyq/
[05:27:47] <taplar> which appears to be what that link has, lol
[05:30:09] <foofoobar> taplar: but the time is still included (which should not)
[05:30:52] <taplar> foofoobar: hmm?  i see the time in the html output, not the console log...
[05:32:27] <foofoobar> ah, sorry
[05:32:30] <foofoobar> you are right
[06:09:22] <stefanocerelli> dylancole exactly
[06:19:20] <emilkarl> Hi, working on a “timeline” where I want to position blocks. Setting X pos is no problem, but If one or more blocks appears in the same X it should move positions down as well.
[06:19:29] <emilkarl> anyone got any ideas how to solve?
[06:20:27] <taplar> !paste @ emilkarl
[06:20:30] <taplar> !paste
[06:20:30] <b-ot> taplar: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:20:40] <taplar> ^ emilkarl
[06:21:05] <emilkarl> taplar: sure,
[06:32:13] <emilkarl> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/qsdvhewb/
[06:34:42] <taplar> emilkarl: the position absolute is what is causing them to stack
[06:35:28] <emilkarl> taplar: yes, but I dont want them to stack like that
[06:35:40] <emilkarl> let me update it...
[06:38:14] <emilkarl> check here...
[06:38:16] <emilkarl> https://jsfiddle.net/qsdvhewb/1/
[06:38:35] <emilkarl> I would like them to stack where they need to stack, but if possible start from Y=0
[06:39:05] <emilkarl> so I guess I need to detect collisions in some way and calculate best Y pos for current block or something
[06:39:08] <emilkarl> I have no idea.
[06:39:58] <decx> so they should fall down?
[06:40:16] <emilkarl> ex nr 4
[06:40:19] <emilkarl> should start at Y
[06:40:36] <emilkarl> 0
[06:41:16] <emilkarl> and 5 should then start right under nr 3
[06:41:30] <emilkarl> 8 should be on 0 as well
[06:41:39] <decx> wouldnt 8 be under 3?
[06:43:45] <taplar> oh, interesting
[06:44:03] <taplar> i was trying to turn it into a single line
[06:45:18] <str8uplinux> has anyone ever had a problem with using .click (instead of .submit) to submit a form (using ajax), and if a user doubleclicks the form submits twice?
[06:45:41] <decx> why wouldnt it?
[06:46:02] <taplar> str8uplinux: the apps i usually work on display an overlay on the page while an ajax call is running
[06:46:14] <taplar> so clicks are on the overlay and not on the page
[06:46:52] <str8uplinux> taplar, I usually disable the element on click, but the problem is if you doubleclick really fast it happens before the element is disabled.
[06:47:29] <decx> so you put disabled on the button?
[06:48:06] <str8uplinux> decx, yes.
[06:48:17] <str8uplinux> decx, or i will hide the element
[06:50:38] <str8uplinux> the problem is, if you double click really fast it catches that second click before the element is hidden or disabled.
[06:51:00] <str8uplinux> just didn't know if anyone else has come across this.
[06:51:35] <decx> not really
[06:51:45] <decx> sluggish dom manipulation maybe
[06:52:37] <taplar> do you hide immediately inside your handler?
[06:53:54] <str8uplinux> yes, first thing
[06:53:56] <decx> you could try savign status in data as an alternative
[06:54:00] <decx> https://jsfiddle.net/77wzapgz/
[06:54:24] <emilkarl> taplar decx: something like this… http://almende.github.io/chap-links-library/js/timeline/examples/example15_mobile.html
[06:54:53] <emilkarl> but to start with just plot out every block
[06:55:17] <decx> why dont you jsut change your dataset to include the y position instead of planning to use collision detection ^^
[06:56:17] <decx> in your fiddle would 5 be to the left of 4?
[06:56:42] <taplar> emilkarl: can you link your fiddle again?
[06:57:00] <decx> https://jsfiddle.net/qsdvhewb/1/
[06:57:03] <taplar> ty
[06:57:08] <emilkarl> https://jsfiddle.net/qsdvhewb/3/
[06:57:10] <emilkarl> :)
[06:57:25] <emilkarl> decx it will not include X pos...
[06:57:34] <decx> well x is start
[06:57:37] <emilkarl> x pos will be calculated from db, but now U
[06:57:37] <decx> but y?
[06:57:49] <emilkarl> start is X yes
[06:57:51] <emilkarl> in this case
[06:58:00] <emilkarl> but X is calculated form a date value
[06:58:05] <emilkarl> i just simplified
[06:58:24] <emilkarl> because X calculation is no problem
[06:58:36] <emilkarl> but calculating the Y depending on collisions is
[06:59:01] <emilkarl> I want to create an as compact container as possible…without any collisions.
[06:59:44] <emilkarl> Ex 8, 6 and 7 could be on the first row in this case… https://jsfiddle.net/qsdvhewb/3/
[06:59:47] <decx> so it should look like this: http://i.imgur.com/xwH91BF.png ?
[07:00:02] <emilkarl> yes exacl
[07:00:13] <emilkarl> like that or something like it :)
[07:00:17] <decx> see that's a neat little problem
[07:00:23] <decx> we'll get it done
[07:00:28] <emilkarl> cool
[07:00:32] <decx> but first food
[07:00:33] <decx> -.-
[07:00:38] <emilkarl> :P
[07:00:41] <decx> but now we know the specs
[07:00:49] <decx> and people wont start doing stuff that isnt want you want ;)
[07:00:54] <decx> what you want*
[07:01:01] <emilkarl> ok
[07:01:18] <emilkarl> cool, tried to exlain but year image made it much clearer
[07:03:07] <cordovafan8> Hello. I'm having an issue where the screen is going blank when I perform an action only after re-navigating to that page. If I perform the action on initial load, a popup will appear and wait for input, but if I navigate to another page, then navigate back to the original page, the popup will display as it should for a second then a blank screen. There isn't supposed to be any code running at that point. jqm 1.3.1/jq 1.9.1
[07:41:53] <taplar> awww, emi left..
[07:45:11] <taplar> if he comes back i tinkered around and got this: https://jsfiddle.net/qsdvhewb/6/
[07:45:36] <taplar> still got a couple collisions
[07:52:22] <cordovafan8> Hello again. I've narrowed down my popup issue. jqm 1.3.1. If I navigate away from a page, then back to it, load this popup, the containing page element is set to display: none.

[07:53:29] <taplar> ^ cordovafan8
[08:07:08] <cordovafan8> taplar: Hrmm. It seems it was at least partly solved by setting the page transition default to none explicitly for non-mobile clients
[08:13:25] <cordovafan8> seems it was completely solved with that :D
[08:13:30] <cordovafan8> no idea why really
[08:13:37] <taplar> nice
[08:14:32] <emilkarl> any ideas decx
[08:14:33] <emilkarl> ?
[08:14:34] <emilkarl> :)
[08:15:07] <taplar> emilkarl:  i came up with this earlier https://jsfiddle.net/qsdvhewb/6/
[08:15:10] <shoky> emilkarl:   <taplar> awww, emi left.. <taplar> if he comes back i tinkered around and got this: https://jsfiddle.net/qsdvhewb/6/
[08:15:11] <shoky> oh
[08:15:14] <taplar> still has a little issue
[08:15:32] <emilkarl> ah...
[08:15:39] <emilkarl> disconnected for a while. had to get some beer :P
[08:16:05] <emilkarl> well it is better than my attempt
[08:16:08] <Uhkis> that's the spirit! :D
[08:17:56] <emilkarl> lol
[08:19:18] <Uhkis> ?api children @ emilkarl
[08:19:19] <b-ot> emilkarl: .children(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[08:19:28] <Uhkis> omg, the bot is fixed!

[08:20:11] <taplar> ?paste @ Uhkis
[08:20:18] <taplar> booo
[08:20:29] <Uhkis> now that's weird
[08:20:40] <emilkarl> Id rather not divide them into rows but instead change the Y param.
[08:21:29] <Uhkis> i guess i have some karma here so the bot obeys me :D
[08:21:35] <emilkarl> I have some idea to use something like this maybe? http://yckart.github.io/jquery.overlaps.js/
[08:22:30] <taplar> once i get this unit test to pass i'll tinker some more if I can
[08:30:18] <emilkarl> ok sure
[08:33:33] <Pazician> Hello, my slideToggle() repeats a few times, why? It's really messed up, but it's only on resize, it works just fine if you just don't resize the screen.
[08:33:52] <Pazician> This is my whole code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/074fcb297aa9884004c8
[08:34:29] <Pazician> On line: 184 is my code where it's messes up.
[08:35:20] <robertmaxrees> Pazician have you tried paring down the code to only the relevant bits?
[08:35:40] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: What you mean?
[08:36:03] <robertmaxrees> making a test case in a jsfiddle, for instance.
[08:36:14] <robertmaxrees> instead of looking at all 200+ lines, look at the few that are relevant here.
[08:37:03] <Pazician> I thought it maybe is better to post the whole document, since it's messed up somewhere else in the code. But sure, I can try to make a jsfiddle
[08:37:06] <robertmaxrees> also - i'd consider not using slidetoggle but instead be explicit.
[08:37:20] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: What else should I use?
[08:37:36] <robertmaxrees> explicit calls to slideUp() and slideDown()
[08:38:04] <taplar> Pazician: it looks like some of the functions that you are performing on a resize are creating bindings
[08:38:24] <taplar> Pazician: it's most likely that you are double or triple+ binding on the same elements with the same handler
[08:38:51] <Pazician> taplar: Where would I do that, on which line?
[08:39:11] <robertmaxrees> Pazician he's saying btnAbMore.on('click', function(e) { is bad in funPar
[08:39:18] <taplar> yep
[08:39:37] <robertmaxrees> every time you call funPar(), you bind that handler again.
[08:39:53] <Pazician> Oh, but how do I make it right then?
[08:40:03] <robertmaxrees> move the binding outside of that function.
[08:40:13] <robertmaxrees> why is it in there in the first place?
[08:40:45] <Pazician> Bcuz it's just if it's more than 1 paragraph then it should run, right?
[08:41:38] <Rainb> how'd you sort children? insertBefore? or replace all the children?
[08:41:59] <decx> you can sort a jquery collection and append it
[08:42:07] <decx> it'll just replace itself
[08:43:13] <Pazician> taplar, robertmaxrees: Could you guys maybe explain how I could write it in the right way?
[08:44:04] <taplar> Pazician: are these elements dynamically created?
[08:44:32] <Pazician> I'm using WordPress, or what do you mean?
[08:44:34] <Rainb> decx: if I don't append it, it won't sort itself?
[08:44:52] <taplar> Pazician: are you inserting them into the dom with ajax?
[08:44:54] <decx> the dom doesnt know about your jquery object ^^
[08:45:02] <taplar> Pazician: or as a result of ajax
[08:45:21] <Rainb> decx: if I don't change anything to the jquery object and append it twice, will it replace itself twice?
[08:45:34] <Pazician> No Ajax at all, what I know. I just pasted the whole document that I've and I'm not using Ajax at all in there
[08:46:00] <decx> it's still a reference to the original object so it won't be duplicated
[08:46:12] <taplar> Pazician: then just as you are binding on the window to handle for a resize, just bind your handler at that level.  not in another handler
[08:46:54] <Rainb> decx: how do you clone a jquery object
[08:47:01] <Pazician> taplar: What's a handler? Sorry for my question man, I'm all new to this
[08:47:17] <decx> .clone() ?
[08:47:18] <taplar> Pazician: $(selector).on(event, handler)
[08:47:44] <Pazician> taplar: So you mean inside the btnAbMore, I should what?
[08:47:56] <taplar> hold on....
[08:47:56] <Rainb> decx: fascinating
[08:48:06] <robertmaxrees> Pazician you can do that before all of this code really.
[08:49:09] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: The thing is that I'm almost everytime I talk to you guys I feel really lost, and just confused. What do you mean before all of this code?
[08:49:34] <robertmaxrees> Pazician let's flip the idea around - why is the event binding where you put it?
[08:50:23] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: Binding do you mean a variable with binding, right? I use that bcuz we talked yesterday I should use it that way and not like a plugin, right?
[08:50:24] <taplar> Pazician: http://jsfiddle.net/ecwo9Lcn/
[08:51:00] <Pazician> taplar: Yeah, isn't that like I've?
[08:51:15] <robertmaxrees> Pazician event bindings - using .on()
[08:51:26] <taplar> Pazician: but that can go in your base level
[08:51:46] <taplar> not inside any other {} block other than the document ready part
[08:51:54] <taplar> as it doens't depend on anything else
[08:53:05] <Pazician> taplar: You mean, so I could use that outside the if statement, right?
[08:53:14] <Pazician> It doesn't have to be inside the if statement?
[08:54:01] <robertmaxrees> why would it?
[08:54:08] <taplar> Pazician: at this level: http://jsfiddle.net/ecwo9Lcn/1/
[08:55:37] <robertmaxrees> hell even this would help: http://fixee.org/paste/ghfbtxa/
[08:57:05] <Pazician> Oh, so it doesn't even need to be inside the if statement? Will it still be repeating then?
[08:57:05] <robertmaxrees> Pazician see where i put the event handler there?
[08:57:10] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't.
[08:57:17] <robertmaxrees> whyt did you put it inside the if statement in the first place?
[08:57:46] <Pazician> Yeah, at the top. Bcuz I thought that it should only run if the if statement returns true
[08:57:54] <robertmaxrees> what should run?
[08:57:57] <robertmaxrees> the event binding?
[08:58:16] <robertmaxrees> i think you're conflating "event binding" with the logic it runs.
[08:58:37] <Pazician> The click function. Can you explain what's event, what's that?
[08:59:00] <taplar> Pazician: event is an interaction with the page from the user
[08:59:08] <taplar> Pazician: clicks, key presses, etc
[08:59:42] <taplar> Pazician: .click() is telling the logic what should happen when the element in quesiton is clicked by the user
[08:59:49] <robertmaxrees> Pazician $('.someElement').on('someEvent', function() {}); <- this is the binding.
[09:00:07] <Pazician> Oh, alright
[09:00:38] <robertmaxrees> the function is the handler - the code that runs when that event occurs.
[09:02:34] <cardguy1000_> In jquery mobile I’d like to have a header without any of the default styling.  I found I can accomplish this by just using a div without a data-role=‘header’.  However I have a panel that pushes out moving the contents of the header with it.  If I don’t have the header role then the panel just pushes over the top instead of sliding it over.  Is there a way to keep the header data role but remove all the styling?
[09:02:38] <Pazician> So basically just to make it clear, event = e.g click(); binding = function() {});, and the handles is the function basically?
[09:02:45] <robertmaxrees> no.
[09:03:02] <robertmaxrees> click() is the binding, same with .on('click'...)
[09:03:05] <robertmaxrees> function is the handler.
[09:03:06] <decx> off to http://learn.jquery.com
[09:03:11] <robertmaxrees> Pazician ^
[09:03:12] <decx> do it now
[09:03:23] <taplar> lol, suttle
[09:03:43] <Pazician> Lol, gotta check that link out and study a bit...
[09:03:55] <decx> yeah where's the exclaimation top level domain for more imperative urls
[09:03:58] <taplar> definately worth the time
[09:04:24] <PaserError> hi
[09:04:38] <taplar> hola
[09:04:40] <Pazician> taplar: I guess so.
[09:04:47] <robertmaxrees> taplar ++
[09:04:51] <PaserError> i have a problem with my jquery script
[09:04:58] <taplar> !ask
[09:04:58] <b-ot> taplar: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:05:03] <taplar> ^ parsons
[09:05:05] <taplar> carp
[09:05:08] <taplar> lmao, crap
[09:05:12] <taplar> ^ PaserError
[09:06:40] <PaserError> i have a navigation in ajax (navigation.js) and in other file for my FX jquery (main.js) when i change the content with my navigation ajax, my FX jquery not work or not load, why this problem?
[09:06:47] <CarlFK> how do I share a fiddle ?
[09:06:59] <robertmaxrees> CarlFK save it and share the url.
[09:07:13] * robertmaxrees looks into his crystal ball at ParserError's code
[09:07:20] <robertmaxrees> hrm... i can't see anything.  weird.
[09:07:39] <robertmaxrees> ParserError ;) something tells me your "FX jquery" is binding to things that the ajax code loads in, yeah?
[09:07:40] <taplar> I got results may vary
[09:07:54] <CarlFK> robertmaxrees: doh.  thanks.  so why does this work http://jsfiddle.net/hs4ns6c0/  but not http://img.flnet.org/a/dj.html ?
[09:08:12] <robertmaxrees> CarlFK open your console.
[09:08:29] <taplar> heh
[09:08:42] <robertmaxrees> CarlFK notice how you're loading everything twice?
[09:08:58] <robertmaxrees> 2 copies of jquery and 2 copies of snowfall?
[09:09:01] <ParserError> yes robertmaxrees http://pastebin.com/wajSvGCh it's my script ajax
[09:09:27] <CarlFK> robertmaxrees: oh right.  it didn't work with just once ;)
[09:09:31] <ParserError> and my FX jquery http://pastebin.com/9JKaP6bS
[09:09:52] <ParserError> i don't know why this problem
[09:10:41] <CarlFK> robertmaxrees: removed one set. still no snow
[09:10:54] <ParserError> the code jquery is loaded in footer.php and footer.php isn't charging for each content
[09:11:18] <CarlFK> TypeError: $(...).snowfall is not a function  hmm...
[09:14:03] <taplar> ParserError: the data that is being inserted in your non-FX script, is it being inserted as a child of the '.box' element?
[09:15:03] <ParserError> yes .box is  centerpiece
[09:15:14] <robertmaxrees> CarlFK right - you need to only load one copy of jquery and one copy of snowfall.
[09:15:49] <taplar> ParserError: so '#navAjax' is a child element of '.box'?
[09:16:14] <ParserError> no taplar not  #navAjax
[09:16:42] <CarlFK> robertmaxrees: er.. looks like one is 404ing...  derp.
[09:16:42] <taplar> ParserError: so your fx logic is setup to handle events based off of children of the .box class
[09:17:03] <CarlFK> I thought I was bumping into some sort of cross site security thing
[09:17:03] <taplar> ParserError: if your not inserting as children of .box, it won't do anything
[09:17:12] <robertmaxrees> CarlFK ah.
[09:17:51] <robertmaxrees> ParserError this code assumes .box exists before the ajax runs.
[09:18:16] <taplar> ParserError: $('.box').on('click', '.boxInner', function(e) {});  <-- that delegate handler says do the logic when any child element of '.box' with the class '.boxInner' is clicked
[09:18:29] <robertmaxrees> taplar that won't work if .box doesn't yet exist,.
[09:18:38] <robertmaxrees> they'll have the same problem they've got currently :)
[09:18:42] <taplar> I don't think he's inserting children
[09:18:56] <robertmaxrees> oh you're explaining the code.
[09:19:05] <robertmaxrees> and something tells me he's inserting all of .box
[09:19:22] <robertmaxrees> becuase people assume that by using the delegated syntax things magically just work.
[09:19:25] <taplar> you think .box is in his data
[09:19:38] <robertmaxrees> yep - i think that's one of the elements he's appending
[09:19:40] <CarlFK> yay, now that I got the URL right it works :p
[09:21:19] <ParserError> ok taplar then, i don't understand
[09:21:26] <taplar> k
[09:21:29] <taplar> .box
[09:21:29] <robertmaxrees> ParserError what don't you understand?
[09:21:42] <taplar> where does .box exist?  how is it created?
[09:22:30] <ParserError> robertmaxrees: I do not understand many things I relied a tutorial for AJAX
[09:22:53] <robertmaxrees> this explains a lot ^ taplar asked you a good question.
[09:22:57] <ParserError> taplar: .box in file load
[09:23:01] <robertmaxrees> :)
[09:23:15] <taplar> file load?  the data returned from the ajax?
[09:23:18] <taplar> or on page load
[09:23:24] <ParserError> yes taplar
[09:23:30] <taplar> which?
[09:23:34] <ParserError> on page load with AJAX
[09:23:37] <robertmaxrees> LOL
[09:23:40] <robertmaxrees> so with ajax.
[09:23:49] <taplar> ok
[09:23:53] <robertmaxrees> ParserError you need to change .box to the element you're loading everything into.
[09:24:00] <taplar> yeah
[09:24:02] <robertmaxrees> where does the ajax code put everything?
[09:24:31] <taplar> ParserError: this line: $('.box').on('click', '.boxInner', function(e) {});  as explained above, it creates the handler for the event
[09:24:39] <taplar> ParserError: but this assumes the element already exists
[09:24:47] <robertmaxrees> * the .box element already exists
[09:25:00] <taplar> ParserError: yeah, clarification, the parent exists
[09:25:19] <taplar> ParserError: so if what you are trying to bind on does not exists yet, it doesn't do you any good
[09:25:43] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ and http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events cover the topic pretty well :)
[09:27:44] <ParserError> ok
[09:28:05] <ParserError> i change .box by .navAjax ?
[09:28:09] <CarlFK> that snow hits: <header> <br/><br/><br/></header>   How can I have it fill the visible window?
[09:28:57] <taplar> ParserError: from what i'm seeing, if .box is inserted into #navAjax, then yes, your binding could change to $('#navAjax').on('click'.......);
[09:29:42] <ParserError> ok i test this
[09:30:28] <ParserError> taplar: thank you it's good :)
[09:30:38] <taplar> robert helped too, :P
[09:30:39] <ParserError> and now i understand this system
[09:30:42] <|RicharD|> hi
[09:31:02] <taplar> hey ricky with bars
[09:31:37] <ParserError> the box exist already before ajax then the element were no longer concerned with the ajax
[09:32:00] <robertmaxrees> ParserError does .box get replaced in the ajax?
[09:32:08] <ParserError> thank you robertmaxrees and taplar for you good explanation
[09:32:15] <robertmaxrees> oh welp/.
[09:32:16] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[09:32:53] <|RicharD|> guys in a script i change a text and add some html tag(link tags), but then when I show the text it showed
[09:32:58] <ParserError> no in my FX jquery  $('#navAjax').on('click', '.boxInner', function() {
[09:33:01] <|RicharD|> like text and not like link
[09:33:04] <|RicharD|> why ?
[09:33:13] <robertmaxrees> |RicharD| make a fiddle
[09:33:54] <|RicharD|> sure
[09:35:10] <taplar> dunno why i said bars, those are pipes.  he's ricky with pipes
[09:36:27] <taplar> i should become a tech product sales man, then i could change my name to |Dream
[09:37:24] <taplar> tough crowd, tough crowd....
[09:41:28] <ParserError> in -> //  $('#navAjax').on('click', '.boxInner', function(e) {  //  the "e" in () is useful taplar ?
[09:42:10] <robertmaxrees> ParserError do you use it in the function?
[09:42:14] <taplar> ParserError: the e is the event object.  it can be useful if you want to check what key was used to create an event or even for terminating an event
[09:43:50] <ParserError> ok then is not useful because i didn't not need to manage the stop ...
[09:43:58] <taplar> ;)
[09:44:02] <ParserError> thank you robertmaxrees  an taplar
[09:44:12] <ParserError> and*
[09:44:22] <ParserError> very excellent explanation very very
[09:44:28] <ParserError> i understand
[09:44:38] <ParserError> thank for your help :)
[09:44:43] <robertmaxrees> ParserError have you checked out the documentation?
[09:45:02] <ParserError> robertmaxrees: because she's english and i french
[09:45:14] <ParserError> an google translate so bad in translation
[09:47:38] * robertmaxrees shrugs
[09:47:43] <robertmaxrees> it's the same language we're speaking here :)
[09:48:15] <taplar> si
[09:50:44] <Synthead> is it safe to delete items out of an array being enumerated via $.each?  i.e.  $.each(foos, function(i, foo) { if (foo === 5) delete foos[i] })
[09:50:55] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[09:51:01] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid deleting things, fwiw.
[09:52:01] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: how so?
[09:52:39] <robertmaxrees> back up - why are you deleting items?
[09:52:52] <robertmaxrees> mutable data is always a funky idea :)
[09:53:05] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: really long story involving selecting rows while using filters in slickgrid
[09:53:14] <decx> if i delete stuff from an array i use while(i--)
[09:53:56] <robertmaxrees> why not .map() or .filter() to retain the original data and then avoid all the headaches of deleting from the original array?
[09:54:02] <Synthead> robertmaxrees, decx: yeah, I just didn't know if $.each copies the array or refers to the array as its being read (which would make the example buggy)
[09:54:15] <decx> right just retain the original
[09:54:22] <decx> that's the ticket
[09:54:39] <Synthead> I'm asking because I think it'd be silly to avoid a problem that doesn't exist
[09:55:22] <decx> while(i--) served me well when i delete particles in a moving canvas
[09:55:29] <decx> without i headaches
[09:55:38] <decx> for collision or whatever
[09:56:08] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: can I use $.filter on an array?  the docs show it being used for dom elements
[09:56:25] <robertmaxrees> there are native methods for all of this.
[09:56:30] <robertmaxrees> .forEach(), .filter(), .map.
[09:57:06] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: $.filter([1, 2], function(item) { item == 1}) results in Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'nodeType' of undefined
[09:57:15] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you use jquery's filter.
[09:57:22] <robertmaxrees> there is no $.filter(), there's $.fn.filter()
[09:57:28] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, Array.prototype.filter
[09:57:53] <robertmaxrees> ['foo', 'bar'].filter(function(theString) { return theString === 'bar'; });
[09:58:57] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: oh interesting
[09:59:20] <robertmaxrees> ['foo', 'bar'].forEach(function(theString) { console.log(theString); });
[09:59:24] <robertmaxrees> etc
[10:00:18] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: ahh, ok.  I'll redefine my var using .filter or $.map.
[10:00:27] <Synthead> robertmaxrees, decx: thanks a lot!
[10:00:37] <robertmaxrees> you just create a local copy of the array within the function and work agauinst that state instead.
[10:00:47] <robertmaxrees> and use native .map()
[10:00:52] <robertmaxrees> no need to use jquery for everything :)
[10:03:49] <decx> maybe the array has 10million indices
[10:03:56] <decx> garbage collector is gonna run wild
[10:04:08] <robertmaxrees> then your problem is you have an array of 10 million indices.
[10:04:11] <decx> haha
[10:04:24] <robertmaxrees> and you're an outlier and get to finally think about optimizing things ;)
[10:04:36] <decx> yo, this particle cursor is sweet, (requires i7 to run smooth)
[10:05:03] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[10:05:05] <robertmaxrees> decx++
[10:05:14] <decx> remember that flash phase
[10:05:18] <robertmaxrees> YES
[10:05:22] <decx> when everyone did stuff that followed the cursor
[10:05:23] <robertmaxrees> that was so awful.
[10:05:27] <decx> ye
[10:05:35] <Synthead> fucking hell guys
[10:05:43] <Synthead> why you gotta bring that shit up
[10:05:45] <Synthead> damn
[10:05:52] <Synthead> now I feel depressed
[10:05:54] <Synthead> :D
[10:05:55] <decx> post traumatic shockwave syndrome
[10:06:02] <robertmaxrees> i wonder what stuff we're going to look back on that we're super stoked on today and laugh at.
[10:06:03] <decx> *disorder
[10:06:09] <Synthead> shockwave, lol
[10:06:16] <robertmaxrees> like, 5 million frameworks is pretty terrible, but what else.
[10:06:35] <Synthead> tracking pixels are pretty bad
[10:06:37] <decx> the resurgence of the inline script
[10:06:42] <Synthead> iframes
[10:06:56] <decx> reddit
[10:06:58] <Synthead> google+ ... tee hee
[10:07:20] <Synthead> remember "Windows Live! Spaces" ?
[10:07:42] <robertmaxrees> i'd rather not.
[10:08:05] <decx> it's called spaces because there is so much of it because nobody used that shit
[10:08:19] <Synthead> hey look guise, I'm gonna compete with facebook! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Live_Spaces#/media/File:Windows_live_spaces.PNG
[10:08:33] <Synthead> it's like movie maker, but with friends!
[10:13:09] <Brewster> for some reason the empty() function is not working as advertised and is instead deleting the actual node along with its children
[10:13:10] <Brewster> http://jsfiddle.net/vojkgdtL/1/
[10:13:15] <Brewster> here is my code
[10:13:35] <Brewster> what can I do differently to change this?
[10:13:58] <shoky> Brewster: this doesn't look right  $("#search_results").appendTo('<p><a href="' + majors[j].link + '">' + majors[j].name + '</a></p>');
[10:14:13] <robertmaxrees> you want that the other way around.
[10:14:17] <Brewster> oh oops
[10:14:40] <Brewster> wow it works now
[10:14:41] <Brewster> thanks
[10:14:45] <robertmaxrees> or use .append() instead :)
[10:15:23] <Brewster> I had append to begin with but it wasn't working then so I switched thinking what I was thinking was backwards

[10:40:13] <jimcornette> hello there I have a issue with websockets and jquery.  Not sure if there is a work around in jquery.,  So I have a function after I get a message in websocket I append to a thing.  Then I need a click event for  after they are created but can not seem to make it work. example code  http://pastebin.com/TXHRfV8Y
[10:40:13] <jimcornette> thanks for you time
[10:40:13] <jimcornette> your *
[10:40:55] <Parsec300> When I use the .datepicker() from jQuary UI and want to have a different date-format I can specify it like .datepicker( 'option', 'dateFormat', 'yy.mm.dd' );
[10:41:19] <robertmaxrees> jimcornette use event delegation instead.
[10:41:25] <Parsec300> However, I can only do that so it seems after adding the .datepicker() first. Is this normal or is it a bug?
[10:41:55] <robertmaxrees> jimcornette $("#lsFiles").on('click', '#rightFilte', function() {});
[10:42:07] <jimcornette> robertmaxrees, Thanks I will read up on that. Just moving from C++ and C to this.
[10:42:19] <robertmaxrees> jimcornette javascript is interesting.
[10:42:41] <robertmaxrees> don't let the c-like syntax fool you though - very different language :)
[10:42:56] <robertmaxrees> Parsec300 if you set it that way, that's normal.
[10:42:57] <jimcornette> yeah I have noticed but it is Super fun !
[10:43:08] <robertmaxrees> Parsec300 you can also do this: https://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-dateFormat
[10:44:35] <Lencl> hello
[10:45:37] <Parsec300> robertmaxrees, ah, ok. Thanks
[10:45:49] <Lencl> I have a form with <form action="?id=2" data-ajax="false"> using jquery mobile
[10:46:06] <Lencl> when it submits, it removes the ?id=2... is there something in jquery mobile interfering with it?
[10:47:24] <robertmaxrees> Lencl actions are urls, not querystrings iirc.
[10:47:35] <robertmaxrees> rather, hosts/paths
[10:47:43] <jimcornette> robertmaxrees, again thanks that worked like a charm !
[10:47:45] <robertmaxrees> querystrings are generated by your form.
[10:47:55] <robertmaxrees> jimcornette check out "event delegation" for more info.
[10:48:13] <jimcornette> will do ! again thanks
[11:25:46] <icedburg> hey, has anybody ever used remodal for youtube embeds?
[11:25:59] <robertmaxrees> maybe.  why do you ask?
[11:26:09] <icedburg> https://github.com/VodkaBears/Remodal
[11:26:47] <icedburg> I'm working on a wordpress site for a local movie theater, and I'm trying to implement remodal in order to display trailers
[11:27:40] <robertmaxrees> okay.  where are you getting stuck?
[11:28:25] <icedburg> I have the unique ID for each trailer's video on youtube, and I'm thinking I'll probably store each as a data attribute on the <a> link for each film box
[11:28:43] <icedburg> however, I'm unsure how best to approach the embed
[11:28:54] <robertmaxrees> by using iframes i would assume.
[11:29:08] <notchris> If I append an element to the body on document ready, how do I select that element?
[11:29:16] <notchris> It’s not letting me select it via class
[11:29:17] <robertmaxrees> notchris by... selecting it?
[11:29:20] <robertmaxrees> wut
[11:29:26] <icedburg> robertmaxtrees: that's what I figured
[11:29:42] <LiENUS> does jquery 2 work with ie9?
[11:30:00] <robertmaxrees> LiENUS http://jquery.com/browser-support/
[11:30:01] <icedburg> finding a workaround for autoplay is gonna be the real beast
[11:30:15] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use autoplay imo.
[11:30:17] <robertmaxrees> but meh
[11:30:52] <robertmaxrees> notchris are you appending to document or to body?
[11:32:01] <notchris> robertmaxrees: http://rocketb.in/paste/rXbm7z
[11:32:30] <robertmaxrees> what's with the var count = 0; ?
[11:32:38] <robertmaxrees> each can handler tat part for you.
[11:32:47] <robertmaxrees> $('table').each(function (element, index){
[11:32:55] <robertmaxrees> then just use index.
[11:32:55] <notchris> robertmaxrees: There’s a lot of tables being converted, to be able to select them better, I wanted to add a class structure like
[11:32:57] <LiENUS> well that explains why the user kept using ie
[11:32:59] <notchris> table-1, table-2
[11:33:03] <LiENUS> now if only they wouldnt use it in the first place
[11:33:03] <notchris> ect..
[11:33:23] <notchris> ahhh
[11:33:35] <robertmaxrees> notchris also, this is really... weird.
[11:33:52] <robertmaxrees> don't use regex for html.
[11:34:01] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to replace a table with divs and spans?
[11:34:31] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Yes, we use a super old ticketing system
[11:34:38] <notchris> And I can only use js, no html
[11:34:43] <robertmaxrees> so the first problem here is trying to replace things like that.
[11:34:48] <notchris> It sucks I know, but until we can afford a new system
[11:34:54] <notchris> They want me to try to clean it up
[11:35:08] <robertmaxrees> you should extract the data differently is what i'm saying
[11:35:11] <Lencl> hmm so I tried <form action="?id=2"> on a non-jquery mobile environment and went through fine.. yet this won't work in jquery mobile -> <form id="uploadBanner" data-enhance="false" data-role="none" action="?id=2" data-ajax="false" enctype="multipart/form-data">
[11:35:13] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're going to be fighting against it.
[11:35:24] <robertmaxrees> Lencl that sounds about right - i'd never put querystring params in the action.
[11:35:38] <Lencl> robertmaxrees where would you put them?
[11:35:39] <notchris> robertmaxrees: That’s true
[11:35:43] <robertmaxrees> Lencl hidden inputs
[11:35:50] <robertmaxrees> Lencl you can feel free to peruse the source and/or submit a ticket with the bug.
[11:36:21] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Can I hide everything but still make it available to select information
[11:36:29] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:36:31] <notchris> detach right?
[11:36:38] <notchris> Like, I’ll never fix this table layout
[11:36:42] <notchris> So what if I hid everything
[11:36:49] <Lencl> this means I won't be able to get the page id directly with $_GET['id']
[11:36:56] <robertmaxrees> all aboard the performance train, notchris :)
[11:36:59] <notchris> And then injected a basic html layout and then pull the info I need
[11:37:08] <robertmaxrees> Lencl you could format the data the way you want and still use that server-side if you want.
[11:37:10] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Well what do you recommend then?
[11:37:22] <notchris> Because I’ve been trying to figure out what to do for like two weeks now
[11:37:31] <robertmaxrees> define "clean it up"
[11:37:41] <notchris> I want to convert it to a bootstrap layout
[11:37:44] <notchris> And use divs
[11:38:15] <robertmaxrees> why do businesses do shit like this?  "We can't afford to do something, so we'll pay a developer to do it instead."
[11:38:24] <robertmaxrees> and then they wind up spending as much as they would have on just biting the bullet.
[11:38:35] <notchris> I’m not trying to complain about what I’m asked to do, I’m just trying to do it man
[11:38:39] <notchris> I know it sucks
[11:38:40] <robertmaxrees> i know, just irks me.
[11:39:01] <robertmaxrees> anyway - you could JSON-ify relevant data and then slap in a templating system and go fromthere.
[11:39:03] <notchris> I also dont mind because it’s experience for me
[11:39:07] <robertmaxrees> what ticketing system are you on, btw?
[11:39:18] <notchris> robertmaxrees: it’s called Patrons Edge
[11:39:21] <Lencl> robertmaxrees Lol it's because I forgot to put method="post"... default is "get" XD
[11:39:27] <notchris> It’s for non-profits
[11:39:55] <robertmaxrees> Lencl hah
[11:39:59] <robertmaxrees> there you go ;)
[12:18:06] <npme> Hey can anyone help me out with javascript?
[12:18:12] <robertmaxrees> !ask
[12:18:12] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:18:13] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:18:27] <npme> Lol ok
[12:18:41] <npme> I'm trying to code a hangman game in javascript
[12:19:54] <npme> We're using constructors to do this
[12:20:02] <robertmaxrees> okay
[12:20:05] <robertmaxrees> what's the question?
[12:20:40] <umpaanet> what editor are you using
[12:21:01] <robertmaxrees> umpaanet sublime text 2
[12:21:05] <npme> How do I randomly choose a string from an array in a constructor to use for the game?
[12:21:12] <arthurvr> umpaanet: (neo)vim
[12:21:21] <npme> I'm also using sublime text 2
[12:21:48] <robertmaxrees> npme http://stackoverflow.com/a/5915122/923919
[12:22:53] <npme> Alright @robertmaxrees thank you, I'll see if I can figure it out from that
[12:23:01] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:23:56] <umpaanet> arthurvr: robertmaxrees: why?
[12:24:02] <robertmaxrees> why what?
[12:24:12] <aeiou> I’m looking to re-create something like this http://www.chanel.com/en_GB/fashion.html  - anyone see anything open source that is similar which I could use to base it on? Basically a full page ‘pasteboard’ with individual interactive items, where you can scroll the screen
[12:24:17] <umpaanet> why do you use vim and why do you use st?
[12:24:26] <npme> How does this work?
[12:24:26] <npme> var randomItem = items[Math.floor(Math.random()*items.length)]
[12:24:49] <npme> There are items in an array [], but the function is within that array
[12:25:14] <robertmaxrees> umpaanet the shortcuts are nice, good packages, fast.
[12:25:18] <robertmaxrees> works well for me.
[12:25:18] <npme> I haven't learned about functions being executed in an array, so where do the items go?
[12:25:33] <robertmaxrees> npme huh?
[12:25:58] <robertmaxrees> Math.floor(Math.random()*items.length) returns a random index bound by the number of items in the array.
[12:26:14] <arthurvr> umpaanet: productivity in general.
[12:26:21] <arthurvr> Though if you’re new to the scene pick ST or Atom and enjoy the easiness for the time being :p
[12:26:22] <robertmaxrees> so items[Math.floor(Math.random()*items.length)] returns a random item from the array.
[12:26:36] <robertmaxrees> ST has a "VIM mode" too, which isn't the same but some people like it.
[12:26:51] <npme> the function 'Math.floor(Math.random()*items.length)' is in array brackets, I thought functions aren't able to be placed in [ ] brackets
[12:27:03] <robertmaxrees> npme that's a function call.
[12:27:11] <robertmaxrees> and [] aren't array brackets in this instance :)
[12:27:13] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: ya but that are just some vim keybindings/modes. None of the real vim power IMHO
[12:27:21] <robertmaxrees> Math.floor(Math.random()*items.length) returns an index
[12:27:26] <arthurvr> anyways this has been discussed sooo many times :p
[12:27:39] <robertmaxrees> so you could do var someIndex = Math.floor(Math.random()*items.length); items[someIndex];
[12:28:56] <robertmaxrees> means the same thing.
[12:29:10] <npme> You're containing Math.floor(Math.random()*items.length) in someIndex and placing that variable in the array, but then say I had "rabbit" "duck" and "goose"
[12:29:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:29:50] <robertmaxrees> i'm not putting anything in the arraythere.
[12:29:53] <npme> Would you select one at random by inputting items[someIndex, "rabbit", "duck", "goose"] ?
[12:29:58] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:30:07] <umpaanet> so code question if I do while(jQuery.browser.ie) { alert('Please use browser google chrome'); } that won't work anymore in modern jquery anymore?????
[12:30:09] <robertmaxrees> items[someIndex]; is how you reference the random index.
[12:30:14] <robertmaxrees> umpaanet nope.
[12:30:42] <npme> So how is that applied to an array?
[12:30:54] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8rc18cjz/
[12:31:00] <robertmaxrees> exactly like it's written.
[12:31:02] <npme> Is it var items = ["rabbit", "duck", "goose"]?
[12:31:15] <robertmaxrees> correct - items is the array.
[12:31:23] <npme> then items[someIndex] to randomly point to one?
[12:31:38] <robertmaxrees> items[Math.floor(Math.random()*items.length)]
[12:31:57] <robertmaxrees> or you could use a variable: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8rc18cjz/1/
[12:33:55] <aeiou> #ui
[12:36:07] <npme> So if I have it right Math.random()*items.length is randomly outputting one number from 0 to the length of the array and Math.floor is turning it into a whole number?
[12:36:15] <npme> What does the * do in that function?
[12:36:27] <robertmaxrees> there's no function.
[12:36:34] <robertmaxrees> rather.
[12:36:42] <robertmaxrees> Math.random() is a function.
[12:36:57] <npme> Right, so is Math.floor()
[12:36:59] <robertmaxrees> items.length is a reference to the length property on the items object.
[12:37:40] <npme> Shouldn't that be items.length-1 for the index?
[12:37:41] <decx> Math.random() is a number between 0 and 1
[12:37:47] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:37:47] <decx> oh i was scrolled
[12:38:02] <decx> hey not that far up ^^
[12:38:04] <npme> I see, I think
[12:38:06] <robertmaxrees> "The Math.floor() function returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number."
[12:38:09] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/floor
[12:38:22] <robertmaxrees> math.floor is giving you a whole number.
[12:39:14] <npme> If Math.random() outputs .523, it'll be multiplied by the length of the array, which is 3 for the rabbit, duck, goose example and then that will be converted to a whole number
[12:39:59] <npme> that spits out an index of that array in items[someIndex], correct?
[12:40:05] <robertmaxrees> yep
[12:40:42] <npme> And that index will be the chosen word, alright, awesome
[12:41:12] <npme> So 3*.523 = 1.569
[12:42:49] <npme> that would round to 2
[12:42:58] <robertmaxrees> Math.floor()
[12:43:18] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/floor - "The Math.floor() function returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number."
[12:45:37] <npme> that would return 1 then, right?
[12:45:46] <robertmaxrees> si.
[12:46:05] <npme> Which in ["rabbit", "duck", "goose"] would log "rabbit"
[12:46:15] <robertmaxrees> duck
[12:46:19] <robertmaxrees> 0-based indexes
[12:46:22] <npme> Fuck right
[12:46:38] <npme> Rabbit is 0
[12:48:12] <npme> http://jsfiddle.net/21wdxyss/
[12:48:30] <robertmaxrees> aaaaah
[12:49:05] <notchris> If I have an object like table[29]
[12:49:10] <notchris> How do I append that as text?
[12:49:19] <robertmaxrees> notchris is it a string?
[12:49:23] <npme> That's the prompt and what I have so far, I'm in a JS/Ruby on Rails bootcamp, General Assembly -- they aren't really helping so is it fine if I ask questions here?
[12:49:24] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Yes
[12:49:29] <robertmaxrees> .append(table[29]);
[12:49:33] <notchris> Ahhh nice
[12:49:35] <notchris> Thank you
[12:49:47] <robertmaxrees> npme there's also ##javascript.
[12:49:50] <robertmaxrees> we can help you as well, though.
[12:51:08] <npme> Awesome, I'll see if I can ask questions in both places
[12:51:13] <robertmaxrees> npme eeeh.
[12:51:20] <robertmaxrees> stick to one or the other :)
[12:51:25] <npme> Lol
[12:51:27] <npme> Okay
[12:51:33] <npme> I'll stay here for now if that's alright
[12:51:34] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Oops, maybe not a string
[12:51:43] <notchris> robertmaxrees: It returns Object {Buy Tickets: "Total↵         $0.00"}
[12:51:43] <robertmaxrees> npme sure.
[12:51:45] <notchris> In the console
[12:51:53] <robertmaxrees> notchris what do you want from it then?
[12:52:10] <notchris> I want to be able to append $0.00, or just the whole object text to the body
[12:52:35] <robertmaxrees> notchris you can JSON.stringify the object.
[12:52:39] <robertmaxrees> thoguh that's kind of gross.
[12:53:03] <notchris> Hmm
[12:53:12] <npme> In this block of code, how do I get hidden to show or hide a value?
[12:53:14] <npme> var Letter = function (value, hidden) {
[12:53:14] <npme>  this.value = value;
[12:53:14] <npme>  this.hidden = hidden;
[12:53:14] <npme>  this.hide = function () {
[12:53:14] <npme>   this.hidden = true
[12:53:14] <npme>  }
[12:53:14] <npme>  this.show = function () {
[12:53:15] <npme>   this.hidden = false
[12:53:15] <npme>  }
[12:53:16] <npme>  this.render = function () {
[12:53:16] <npme>   if (this.hidden = true) {
[12:53:17] <npme>    return "_"
[12:53:17] <npme>   }
[12:53:18] <npme>   if else (this.hidden = false) {
[12:53:18] <npme>    return this.value
[12:53:30] <npme> Shit I should probably use jsfiddle, right?
[12:53:42] <arc_> yes
[12:53:43] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[12:53:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah, don't paste into the channel.
[12:53:56] <npme> Sorry lol, I can't undo that
[12:54:00] <robertmaxrees> i know ;)
[12:56:31] <arc_> robertmaxrees last night somebody was trying to create an autosuggest for a search box, but the focusout event fires before the click event, so he wasn't able to get the element the user clicked on. i told him to just check if the mouse is hovered over the suggestions before hiding it. do you know of a better way of doing that?
[12:57:05] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what those two things have to do with one another.
[12:57:08] <robertmaxrees> brb
[12:57:50] <Uhkis> arc_: you mean this morning? :)
[12:57:56] <arc_> yeah ;/
[12:58:29] <arc_> robertmaxrees because if you click anywhere other than the search field, it loses focus, and hides the suggestions, which happens before the click event, so there's no way to reference what the user would have clicked on.
[12:59:10] <arc_> you could just leave the suggestions up when it loses focus, but i don't think that's really optimal
[12:59:27] <arc_> we got it working, i just don't know if the way we ended up doing it is the best way
[13:01:37] <duch_kazatel> woops
[13:02:25] <robertmaxrees> arc_ you check to see if the click happened outside of the containing element for all of that.
[13:02:56] <npme> http://jsfiddle.net/su2yLLts/
[13:03:22] <npme> For this block of code, I'm having trouble seeing how hidden can switch a character between a letter and underscore
[13:03:27] <npme> Pretty much
[13:03:29] <arc_> that was the first thing i suggested, but ... he didn't seem to be able to get it to work heh
[13:03:40] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty easy arc_
[13:03:42] <arc_> it was kind of a nightmare because i couldn't see the code he was working on
[13:04:10] <robertmaxrees> check if ($(this).is('.someContainer') || $(this).closest('.someContainer'),length) {}
[13:04:14] <robertmaxrees> something like that.
[13:04:21] <robertmaxrees> actually you could just use .closest() there shit.
[13:04:54] <npme> How can I use the boolean to get it to switch from showing _ to showing a character, like in 'hands' it would be _ _ _ _ _, and a user input of a would return _ a _ _ _, and then of s would return, _ a _ _ s, etc
[13:05:22] <npme> That's what I think hidden is doing
[13:05:53] <arc_> i see. all right, thanks
[13:06:10] <arc_> i'm still not 100% sure that would work though
[13:06:27] <robertmaxrees> arc_ it would.
[13:06:45] <robertmaxrees> that's how we did it iirc.
[13:07:44] <npme> Whoa
[13:09:50] <npme> So I guess I'm asking -- how can I modulate the hidden argument to show or hide a letter using a boolean?
[13:10:06] <robertmaxrees> you edit this.theThing
[13:10:27] <robertmaxrees> you should checkout a javascript guide btw.
[13:10:45] <npme> Sure, can you recommend a good one?
[13:10:55] <arc_> i don't think it does work. $(this) is the search box because it's a focusout event, not a click event
[13:11:11] <robertmaxrees> arc_ right, you listen for click events on the document.
[13:11:21] <robertmaxrees> arc_ we implemented one of those boxes on our site :)
[13:11:32] <npme> We're just finishing our first week and I'm very confused about how to use these programming elements
[13:11:49] <robertmaxrees> npme have you said as much to whoever is teaching it?
[13:11:55] <arc_> but then the focusout still fires before the click. the focusout hides the suggestions div before the click event can determine what the user clicked on. at that point there is nothing to click on
[13:12:01] <npme> Lol yes
[13:12:06] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics
[13:12:17] <robertmaxrees> arc_ why are you fixated on focusout?
[13:12:23] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying don't use it at all.
[13:12:38] <arc_> well, you have to have a focusout event because otherwise if you tab out of the box the suggestions will stay there
[13:12:46] <npme> They just say just keep trying exercises and then I should get it, but the exercises they go over are really basic, and our homeworks are insane
[13:13:04] <robertmaxrees> arc_ i'd treat keypress differently if it's that important.
[13:13:09] <arc_> i see
[13:13:29] <npme> This is a merit based bootcamp though, which is why I'm reaching out for help-- I'm not getting a grade, it's just a matter of effort to understanding
[13:13:34] <arc_> i guess you could have a focus event instead and hide if the focused object is a different text field
[13:13:48] <robertmaxrees> arc_ there are a few different ways to approach it.
[13:14:02] <npme> But idfk what the instructors are saying when I try to follow their explanations
[13:14:30] <robertmaxrees> npme https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics
[13:15:25] <npme> robertmaxrees okay I'll take a look at that
[13:33:18] <BytesAndCoffee> right now, im walking an element's children with chained .child[index], right now it looks like $(users[n]).children[1].children[0].children[0].attributes[0].value
[13:33:29] <BytesAndCoffee> is there a more idiomatic way to do this?
[13:33:34] <robertmaxrees> .find()
[13:33:42] <robertmaxrees> and then use a css selector.
[13:33:54] <BytesAndCoffee> ah
[13:35:11] <BytesAndCoffee> $(users[1]).find
[13:35:11] <BytesAndCoffee> undefined
[13:35:15] <cool_boy> Hi there, I want to have a input field with fixed decimal at two places right, this is what I am trying it gives me wrong result could someone check what I am doing wrong here?

[13:36:32] <BytesAndCoffee> i added it in
[13:36:36] <cool_boy> why a key is returned two times :s
[13:36:50] <robertmaxrees> BytesAndCoffee something isn't click here then.
[13:37:10] <BytesAndCoffee> var jq = document.createElement('script');
[13:37:10] <BytesAndCoffee> jq.src = "https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js";
[13:37:10] <BytesAndCoffee> document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(jq);
[13:37:10] <BytesAndCoffee> jQuery.noConflict();
[13:37:38] <robertmaxrees> so you're using jQuery instead of $?
[13:38:25] <RantingHuman> what *is* $ in the chrome console anyway
[13:38:32] <RantingHuman> i fno jquery is included
[13:38:57] <robertmaxrees> it's not included.
[13:39:03] <robertmaxrees> $ in chrome's console is document.querySelector
[13:39:06] <BytesAndCoffee> http://i.imgur.com/AKVv1fJ.png
[13:39:24] <robertmaxrees> $.fn.jquery
[13:39:30] <robertmaxrees> put that in your console
[13:40:01] <RantingHuman> ah
[13:40:10] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:40:20] <BytesAndCoffee> TypeError: Cannot read property 'jquery' of undefined
[13:40:26] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[13:40:42] <robertmaxrees> that noConflict call is relinquishing control of $ back to whatever had it before you loaded jquery
[13:41:04] <robertmaxrees> so $ isn't what you think it is.
[13:41:21] <BytesAndCoffee> var jq = document.createElement('script');
[13:41:21] <BytesAndCoffee> jq.src = "https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js";
[13:41:21] <BytesAndCoffee> document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(jq);
[13:41:24] <BytesAndCoffee> is that better?
[13:41:25] <robertmaxrees> please stop doing that.
[13:41:31] <BytesAndCoffee> sorry
[13:41:32] <robertmaxrees> and that'll work.
[13:41:47] <robertmaxrees> now $ is your copy of jquery, but you've destroyed the copy on the site.
[13:41:52] <robertmaxrees> so that might cause issues.
[13:42:13] <BytesAndCoffee> $.fn.jquery
[13:42:13] <BytesAndCoffee> "1.11.1"
[13:42:20] <cool_boy> does .val() attribute for input box  appends value or replaces ??
[13:42:21] <robertmaxrees> you can use noconflict and then wrap your code in (function($) { /* your code here */ }(jQuery));
[13:42:22] <cool_boy> :S
[13:42:27] <robertmaxrees> cool_boy replaces.
[13:42:49] <cool_boy> robertmaxrees: so why not replacing here? http://jsfiddle.net/HkEuf/6769/
[13:42:56] <cool_boy> or what I am missing?
[13:43:06] <robertmaxrees> BytesAndCoffee or use jQuery(function($) { /* your code here */ }); if you want a document ready.
[13:43:28] <cool_boy> robertmaxrees: I am trying to fix decimal at two places in input box , every key is returned two times
[13:43:38] <robertmaxrees> cool_boy .val() returns a string.
[13:43:55] <decx> fun friday diversion for y'all http://jsfiddle.net/decx/1r226daa/
[13:44:31] <cool_boy> robertmaxrees: that's not issue,  I guess I am operating on strings
[13:45:10] <BytesAndCoffee> there we are
[13:47:37] <robertmaxrees> cool_boy also console.log(String.fromCharCode(e.keyCode)); isn't what you think it is.
[13:48:29] <cool_boy> robertmaxrees: will it not give me value of pressed key?
[13:48:42] <robertmaxrees> cool_boy you;'re conflating charcodes with keycodes
[13:51:58] <BytesAndCoffee> $(users).each(function(index) {console.log($(this).find('.user_image > img')[0].src;)});
[13:52:04] <BytesAndCoffee> where is the missing )
[13:52:08] <robertmaxrees> .prop('src') btw
[13:52:15] <BytesAndCoffee> oh
[13:52:42] <BytesAndCoffee> thanks
[13:52:44] <BytesAndCoffee> still
[13:52:52] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/lmijd34/
[13:53:13] <robertmaxrees> it was the one for console.log()
[13:53:40] <BytesAndCoffee> there we are
[13:53:41] <BytesAndCoffee> tanks
[13:53:45] <BytesAndCoffee> thanks*
[13:53:52] <robertmaxrees> http://plentz.github.io/jquery-maskmoney/ cool_boy just use this.
[13:53:54] <robertmaxrees> problem solved :)
[14:20:35] <jak2000> hi all
[14:23:37] <jak2000> <tfoot><tr> <th align="left" colspan=8>Total</th><th class="classfootervalue">0</th> </tr>                </tfoot>                     in my jQuery i have this code: var rowCount = $('#myTable >tbody >tr').length;  $('.classfootervalue').val(rowCount);   always are 0 the value of the class: classfootervalue, the REAL number of rows is 14 any advice how to fix?
[14:31:36] <fairyrays> Ubiquiti NanoStation M5 ... robust little client ap sorted
[14:32:28] <arc_> jak2000 you are selecting tbody but the html you pasted is tfoot ..
[14:35:56] <BytesAndCoffee> im fetching a page and parsing it into a DOM, how do i search that sub-dom?
[14:55:36] <jak2000> arc_ the clase was declared on a cell of the footer it is bad?
[15:24:58] <BytesAndCoffee> im fetching a full page and want to be able to query it (via something like page.$(query)), how would i go about that?
[15:25:13] <robertmaxrees> $(response).find();
[15:25:53] <BytesAndCoffee> there's no way to parse it to a DOM object?
[15:26:07] <robertmaxrees> that's what that does...
[15:26:10] <BytesAndCoffee> and then add jquery to the new DOM?
[15:26:14] <BytesAndCoffee> oh
[15:26:20] <robertmaxrees> $(response) is the object that came back.
[15:27:14] <BytesAndCoffee> ph
[15:27:16] <BytesAndCoffee> there we go
[15:27:18] <BytesAndCoffee> thanks

[15:44:08] <cool_boy> robertmaxrees: thanks
[18:17:39] <convoluted2> Anyone used this jquery plugin for validating international phone numbers lately?  Not working for me, and wondering if anyone else can confirm?  https://github.com/Bluefieldscom/intl-tel-input#getting-started
[20:50:11] <Voyage>  Is there a way to have 2 iframes in one page showing facebook.com in one and google.com in the other?
[20:54:49] <Max-P> Voyage: Both return "X-Frame-Options: DENY", so nope
[20:55:24] <Max-P> They're explicitely telling the browser to deny any form of frame inclusion, so you're out of luck.
[20:57:48] <Voyage> hm
[21:01:01] <Voyage> Iam making an extension for browser by which when user hits facebook or google, an iframe at top appears with my own content fetched from my website, and facebook or google below that iframe. How it can be done?
[21:01:04] <Voyage> Max-P, ^
[21:04:57] <Max-P> Voyage: I don't know, that probably needs extension-specific APIs
[21:05:04] <Max-P> but you probably can inject code fine then, for sure
[21:05:38] <Max-P> I'm assuming you probably can add like "padding: 300px;" to the body element of the page to make room for your frame and inject an iframe in there at that spot
[21:08:44] <Voyage> Max-P,  good idea but facebook has a sticky header at top.      Now if my iframe is at top, the facebook top header will be hidden. any solution to that?
[21:09:23] <Max-P> Grab the sticky header element and set its CSS top property to something else
[21:10:00] <Voyage> Max-P,  and the down side of this is that if FB or google changed layout again, our extension will break
[21:10:19] <Voyage> Max-P,  am I correct?
[21:10:21] <Max-P> Yeah, that's pretty much how extensions work, unfortunately
[21:10:27] <Voyage> ok
[21:10:37] <Voyage> Max-P,  great help. thanks!
[21:10:52] <Max-P> Neither Facebook nor Google provide a way to add stuff to their site, so yeah you're constantly fighting with them
[21:11:19] <Max-P> A bit in the same way AdBlock and other similar extensions is just and endless race to who will change the names first to circumvent the other
[21:14:44] <Voyage> Max-P,  you said things can be changed, css etc. so can change google's content. right?
[21:16:50] <Max-P> Voyage: As far as I know, extensions are just scripts inserted in the page. So you can do whatever you could if you were at Google and added your script on the page
[21:17:54] <Max-P> So yeah you can add, remove, change elements. Add/remove stylesheets entirely. You can even override some functions if you find a way to reach them. You can hijack the whole thing and store the user password as they enter them in the password field if you ever wanted to
[21:18:23] <Max-P> And of course you can also totally break the site if you're not very careful, or they change something.
[21:19:16] <Voyage> Max-P,  http://www.screencast.com/t/1e7Ls2EFkAX
[21:19:52] <Voyage> Max-P,  great info!
[21:20:27] <Voyage> the extension made ^
[21:20:45] <Voyage> in that video
[21:32:21] <Max-P> Voyage: Here's what you want to do: http://d.max-p.me/temp/iframe.mp4  The only difference is that you also want to make the iframe fixed on top, but you get the idea. YOu open the dev tools, check what elements needs to be modified, and once you're happy with the result you redo it in your extension, refresh and see if you get the intended result
[21:36:49] <Voyage> Max-P,  great!!
[21:41:09] <acidjazz> Voyage: what is this you're making a safari plugin?
[21:45:02] <Voyage> ya
