[02:14:45] <undefined_bob> good morning
[03:06:36] <energizer> How do I find the next input that isnt necessarily a sibling?
[03:08:45] <Cork> depends on where it is in the page
[03:09:28] <Cork> you could do something nasty like var inputs = $(':input'); inputs.eq(inputs.index(current) + 1) but i would recommend against it
[03:09:47] <Cork> better actually select based on the relation for the next element
[03:10:08] <IamTrying> http://paste.ubuntu.com/25476758/ - When i use .resizable() and then resize the button1 it change alignment of other buttons. how to make the resize independent
[03:10:16] <Cork> (.siblings(), .nextAll(), .prevAll() and .find())
[03:10:45] <Cork> IamTrying: its cause the button is normally inline elements
[03:11:01] <Cork> and inline elements are aligned based on the vertical-align css property
[03:11:25] <energizer> Cork: im in a table of inputs, i want to focus the next input regardless of if its in this row or not
[03:12:24] <Cork> energizer: $(this).closest('tr').add($(this).closest('tr').next()).find(':input')
[03:12:28] <IamTrying> Cork: i want the buttons independent without effecting other buttons
[03:12:48] <Cork> IamTrying: then position: absolute it
[03:15:52] <energizer> Cork: could you help me interpret that?
[03:16:33] <Cork> energizer: it finds the parent tr of the current input and adds the next row to the selection
[03:16:42] <Cork> then finds all inputs in those two lines
[03:17:16] <Cork> you will then have to find the current input in that selection and from there take the next in the selection (the .eq(selection.index(this) + 1) thing)
[03:17:47] <energizer> ok ill give it a shot
[03:17:50] <IamTrying> Guru it works thank you - Cork
[04:35:08] <undefined_bob> Cork: maybe I should just start over with a new menu :o
[04:36:34] <undefined_bob> https://jsfiddle.net/4fwg49g3/
[05:00:50] <sammyg> how is on("click", function () {} ) different from click(function () {} ) ?
[05:01:37] <sammyg> my assumption is that the first is pure js, while the second is jq
[05:02:00] <sammyg> i might be wrong
[05:06:02] <localh0st> sammyg: .on is used for dynamically created elements, read docs..
[05:15:09] <EugenA> how can I see the returned value from ajax call on .fail?
[05:17:06] <EugenA> ok, found
[05:21:48] <sammyg> so if i have the element already then i can use click(), but if the element i want to listen for is created on the fly then i use on()
[05:22:16] <sammyg> ok thank you
[06:03:42] <Cork> undefined_bob: that menu is broken for me, the html looks really broken too
[06:05:13] <undefined_bob> here is the plain version of the menu with just a few edits: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/BRPWvx
[06:05:45] <undefined_bob> the html is created by that stupid software I am forced to use. cant do much about it
[06:06:20] <undefined_bob> but I did some edits this morning and now the menu is even more broken, Cork :(
[06:06:29] <undefined_bob> http://undefined.bplaced.net/
[06:06:58] <undefined_bob> maybe I'm just going to use a complete different menu
[06:07:15] <undefined_bob> maybe you can even suggest one?
[06:12:52] <Cork> i usually just build them by hand so no i can't, never used a lib for it
[06:13:23] <undefined_bob> not sure if I can do that too. I dont think so
[06:13:25] <Cork> as long as the html is sound it should be quite easy to make it into a tree menu for example
[06:13:53] <Cork> and from what i saw it looked like a normal nested ul/li tree
[06:13:57] <undefined_bob> but what about all the responsive stuff and so on?
[06:14:13] <Cork> just through @media tags
[06:14:42] <Cork> not something i can throw together here, but it usually don't take more then 4-5h to make from scratch
[06:15:32] <undefined_bob> there is one </li> at the wrong position in the html. but I dont know where I should place it
[06:15:48] <undefined_bob> 4-5 hours for you and 4-5 days for me :D
[06:16:36] <Cork> to handle the touch interface js interaction i would use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia
[06:16:43] <Cork> then you don't need the js class
[06:17:03] <Cork> and it can dynamically respond to when the page goes over into the tree structure
[06:18:12] <undefined_bob> thats new for me
[06:19:11] <undefined_bob> let me think about it
[06:19:23] <Cork> specifically window.matchMedia('(min-width: 400px)').addListener(function(e) { if(e.matches) {} else {} })
[06:19:49] <Cork> anyway lunch
[06:19:51] * Cork afk
[06:44:47] * Kartagis defines undefined_bob
[06:56:25] <undefined_bob> Kartagis: I feel weird now. what have you done? :o
[06:56:52] <Kartagis> I simply defined uoÄ±
[06:56:55] <Kartagis> you
[07:01:57] <Cork> should have done var bob then :)
[07:18:07] <undefined_bob> ow
[07:18:53] <undefined_bob> but Cork I think you're right, make a new menu from the scratch would be the very best
[07:19:20] <Cork> undefined_bob: my point was the one you have just need a styling from scratch
[07:19:47] <undefined_bob> oh I thought you mean to write a whole new one
[07:20:15] <undefined_bob> thats why I wasnt sure
[07:20:17] <Cork> the new one would basically look the same, at least i don't see a reason not to
[07:20:37] <Cork> what you need is a clean start of the styling of the html structure for the menu
[07:21:36] <undefined_bob> yes, like throwing out all the css and start again with the default css of the lib
[07:46:25] <Cork> undefined_bob: just a VERY quick start https://jsfiddle.net/q1h1gk42/
[07:46:28] <Cork> not at all complete
[07:46:41] <Cork> (can't put more time into it)
[08:28:07] <Xorg> guys what does this do
[08:28:09] <Xorg> https://dpaste.de/5WDz
[08:29:09] <hellyeah> you should try jsfiddle
[08:30:11] <undefined_bob> Cork: thank you :)
[09:30:27] <dimi1947> can jquery validate work with name attribute values such as this:form[0][service]..I am referring to the rule section
[09:32:26] <dimi1947> https://hastebin.com/homiluyina.md
[09:34:46] <Cork> dimi1947: i don't see anything in there code for splitting the selector at : and special casing this so i doubt it
[09:35:00] <Cork> though the question is quite vague so you might mean something else
[10:13:35] <dimi1947> Cork:I do not understand exactly what are you trying to say
[10:14:35] <Cork> dimi1947: it was a "don't think so, but your question is very fuzzy so don't even know what your asking exactly"
[10:15:04] <Cork> actually it wasn't even a question but a statement
[10:15:14] <Cork> so what to answer is anyones guess
[10:20:56] <dimi1947> check again this https://hastebin.com/utakipupac.http and tell me...I hope it is more clear now
[10:21:43] <taplar> that's not a valid object key to start with
[10:22:49] <taplar> and easy enough to test to see if it works
[10:24:47] <dimi1947> taplar: yes you are in both statements...I wanted to ask anyway though..SO,concluding,does that mean in other words that jquery validate is not recommended for such name attributes?
[10:25:19] <taplar> is 'form[0][service]' the actual field name?
[10:25:29] <taplar> name="form[0][service]" ?
[10:27:01] <Cork> if it is just "form[0][service]": "required" would be the format
[10:27:05] <dimi1947> https://hastebin.com/ahutodofib.scala to be clear about it
[10:27:32] <taplar> then what Cork said ^
[10:27:57] <taplar> i thought from what i read in the irc log you were asking about an attribute selector of some sort
[10:28:11] <localh0st> dimi1947: class='services text'
[10:28:23] <localh0st> why are you mixing quotes?
[10:28:34] <Cork> ah i took "this:form[0][service]" to be the selector :)
[10:28:59] <Cork> so ya, very unreadable question (three persons and three way of reading it >_<)
[10:29:35] <dimi1947> localh0st:you are right...
[10:37:25] <mark4> so i have a menu of items that i did an empty on and then added some items back into it but i ended up with all the original items plus the ones i added
[10:37:48] <Cork> mark4: jsfiddle.net please
[10:38:18] <mark4> Cork ive never used that, do i need to create a login account on it to use it?
[10:38:23] <Cork> no
[10:38:35] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/
[10:39:14] <Cork> just hit save when you've added the code and html
[10:39:16] <mark4> let me see if i can figure it out
[10:39:27] <Cork> (the html just needs what you have inside body not the full html)
[10:39:30] <mark4> thats a problem
[10:39:36] <mark4> there is no html really
[10:39:50] <taplar> "so i have a menu of items"
[10:39:53] <mark4> its all done in php under wordpress
[10:39:58] <Cork> just take what the server has generated, not what you see server side
[10:40:09] <Cork> the static result of a point in time
[10:40:12] <mark4> aha
[10:40:49] <mark4> even thats a cluster (*$^&* lol
[10:41:06] <Cork> mark4: you don't need all of it, just what is relevant to the question
[10:41:22] <Cork> or if that is simpler, just reproduce the problem with placeholder elements
[10:41:29] <taplar> really all you need is the menu with items, and the logic that empties it, and the part the puts the new stuff in it
[10:41:41] <Cork> ya
[10:42:08] <Cork> basically you need to show what you're doing so we can understand what you're doing
[10:44:47] <mark4> cork i have pasted in my html, js and css but there is nothing in the result, im not even sure what ive pasted is enough to GIVE a result
[10:45:05] <Cork> mark4: hit save and paste the url here
[10:45:20] <mark4> https://jsfiddle.net/u6kv8fh8/
[10:45:44] <taplar> jQuery('.chapters').empty;
[10:45:47] <taplar> empty is a method
[10:45:50] <taplar> put () on the end of it
[10:45:55] <mark4> aha
[10:45:57] <Cork> :)
[10:46:07] <Cork> also you should do this in another way
[10:46:35] <mark4> well techically ive been doing javascript/jquery for less than a week :P
[10:46:47] <mark4> what other way?
[10:46:50] <Cork> i would recommend doing jQuery('.chapters').html(menu_array.join(''))
[10:47:02] <Cork> instead of the for loop AND the empty
[10:47:26] <mark4> cork the logic i have is not 100% correct yet
[10:47:35] <mark4> i dont think
[10:47:37] <taplar> well it looks like hes doing subsets per row
[10:47:43] <Cork> you never want to append in a for loop
[10:47:44] <taplar> so joining them all wouldn't work for that
[10:47:47] <Cork> it is a performance killer
[10:48:06] <taplar> so probably a slice() before the join('')
[10:48:10] <Cork> well you can use ...
[10:48:12] <Cork> exactly :)
[10:48:35] <mark4> if i shrink the width of the window i get less columns and more rows. i only want to show two rows at a time until i mouse over
[10:48:54] <mark4> two rows == the row selected and either the one below it or.. if there is none below it, the one above it
[10:48:57] <Cork> you can do that in css though
[10:49:07] <Cork> no need for js
[10:49:13] <mark4> err how?
[10:49:28] <mark4> oh i AM doing the responsive in css
[10:49:32] <mark4> using media queries
[10:49:32] <undefined_bob> see you tomorrow :)
[10:49:44] <mark4> i pasted my entire css in that jfiddle :)
[10:50:04] <Cork> mark4: set the height based on rem and reset it on hover?
[10:50:07] <mark4> its making them dynamic AND responsive that makes js required
[10:50:29] <Cork> not sure why that would
[10:50:30] <mark4> im using css grid here
[10:51:25] <Cork> heck you could even use nth-child if you wanted
[10:51:47] <Cork> (to hide the extra columns)
[10:51:47] <mark4> i have no idea how lol
[10:51:58] <mark4> im not hiding columns
[10:52:05] <mark4> im hiding rows
[10:52:10] <Cork> ya, sorry meant cells
[10:54:01] <taplar> i wonder if you could set the height of the area to be the height of two rows and give it an overflow-y: hidden
[10:54:11] <taplar> then the :hover would just change that
[10:54:42] <taplar> then let this css grid or bootstrap or whatever adjust the elements itself
[10:54:59] <taplar> instead of js redrawing rows
[10:57:57] <mark4> no bootstrap, just pure css grid but again... my web development skillz are stil in the NUB area :)
[10:58:06] <mark4> now. if you need a forth or asm coder im your man :)
[11:33:29] <jquery890> is it possible to change opacity on touchend/touchstart for mobile elements? On a full screen, I use :hover, but I'm trying to create a solution for mobile
[11:34:01] <taplar> probably
[11:34:21] <jquery890> https://bpaste.net/show/0d6e4103e57e
[11:34:36] <jquery890> there is my code for it, it will work on the first couple, but then stop working
[11:34:50] <taplar> bind('touchend, touchstart, click' is wrong
[11:35:00] <taplar> maybe not
[11:35:03] <jquery890> remove the click?
[11:35:18] <taplar> oh yeah, no commas
[11:35:21] <taplar> just spaces
[11:35:25] <jquery890> I tried it without the click as well, was just trying a few things to see if I can always catch the touch
[11:35:38] <taplar> 'touchend touchstart click'
[11:35:44] <taplar> and use on() instead of bind()
[11:36:27] <taplar> https://j11y.io/jquery/#v=2.1.3&fn=jQuery.fn.bind
[11:36:43] <taplar> bind is just a wrapper now days
[11:37:42] <jquery890> I see, I just updated my code and it seems to have no change
[11:37:56] <taplar> can you make a fiddle?
[11:38:02] <jquery890> Yup, 1 sec
[11:38:08] <jquery890> I'll try and trim it down
[11:44:06] <jquery890> Here you go taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/Lu9dkt23/1/
[11:44:42] <taplar> k
[11:44:45] <jquery890> I put the hover css at the top of the stylesheet
[11:45:45] <taplar> works on my phone
[11:46:50] <jquery890> let me try to add a couple in, because mine worked on the first few, then broke
[11:47:36] <jquery890> what the hell.. works fine with multiple ones
[11:47:44] <jquery890> I have no idea what's going wrong with it
[11:51:01] <taplar> wait, so is your issue with the tapping of it, not the hover?
[11:52:16] <taplar> cause a tap consists of a touchstart and touchend
[11:52:22] <taplar> which would be two toggles with your current logic
[11:56:02] <taplar> heh, this is why i like to use radio buttons
[11:59:19] <jquery890> well more or less the tap to start the hover
[11:59:31] <jquery890> it works on my buddy's phone fine, bu not on mine lol
[11:59:54] <taplar> have you ever seen the radio/checkbox label trick?

[12:36:01] <Nuage> anyone knows of some way to generate an image out of a specific <div> element ?
[12:36:09] <Nuage> in fact i want to add a canvas-generated diagram into a pdf document generated with dompdf, and i see noway to add the said canvas-generated diagram other than converting it to an image then adding the latter to the pdf document
[12:36:11] <taplar> i only added two lines, ^_^

[12:46:09] <srg> Hi. Excuse my n00b question. I have an array. I also have a "<ul> ... </ul>" in my html. How can I .appendTo() each element of the array as a <li> in the list?
[12:46:22] <srg> Should I use $.each ?
[12:47:49] <robertmaxrees> srg what does the array look like?
[12:48:16] <taplar> $(selectThatUL).append($.map(thatArray, function(element){ /* convert element into li */  return li; }))
[12:48:21] <srg> "status: testing", "domain: example.com", "message: hello"
[12:48:30] <srg> It's strings
[12:48:31] <taplar> mmm, that's an object
[12:48:39] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[12:48:49] <robertmaxrees> mind showing us a fleshed out example in a fiddle?
[12:49:03] <srg> Sure, I'll make one. I appreciate the help
[12:49:05] <taplar> oh wait, those are strings
[12:49:08] <taplar> herp derp
[12:52:08] <srg> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=J5zmejIkQ1
[12:52:35] <srg> basically, I want to fetch a json file (I used gist temporarily) and print the contents in a list
[12:53:24] <robertmaxrees> do you want each prop as an LI?
[12:53:30] <srg> Yeah
[12:53:38] <robertmaxrees> so fwiw that's not an array :)
[12:53:51] <taplar> one issue you should be aware of is ln 10-12 isn't going to work
[12:54:04] <taplar> $('<element>') creates a dom node
[12:54:22] <taplar> you append children or set html() or other things to node
[12:54:24] <taplar> *s
[12:54:36] <taplar> you don't append things like '</li>' to them
[12:55:40] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6hzfsapd/
[12:55:43] <robertmaxrees> this is one way.
[12:56:01] <robertmaxrees> though see if your backend can't push out an actual array for you.
[12:56:37] <srg> hmm, thanks robertmaxrees. I'll look at that and see how it works
[12:58:52] <taplar> huh, you can ajax gists?
[12:59:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[12:59:18] <taplar> crazy sause

[21:51:58] <RazorGrapes> Hi guys. Got a strange problem. I have a button (that launches a modal) that I want to press by using .click(), and .click() does work, in that I can detect it has been clicked, but the modal itself does not launch.
[21:54:18] <RazorGrapes> The modal launch button is like so : <a id="modalclick" data-avenuetut-toggle="modal" href="https://remote_widget_location_url_here">Launch Modal</a>
[21:54:18] <RazorGrapes> which works fine when I click it for real.
[21:54:18] <RazorGrapes> //$('#modalclick').click(); doesn't behave the same as a real human click however.
[21:54:23] <RazorGrapes> Any ideas?
[21:58:08] <RazorGrapes> As soon as I asked, of course, I got it
[21:58:30] <RazorGrapes> $('#modalclick')[0].click(); did the job
