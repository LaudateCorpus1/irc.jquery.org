[03:21:08] <Mark__> is there any way i can add ‘preloading div’ unti the content is fully loaded? im using ajax btw
[03:22:09] <Vipii> @mark__ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10964872/div-preloader-with-jquery ?
[03:22:59] <Mark__> really..? is it this simple?
[03:24:18] <d3m0n> Is it possible to have an optional parameter (option/settings) in a jQuery plugin? As in, if it's not set when initilaizing the plugin on doc ready, then it doesn't have any value?
[03:25:29] <Vipii> @Mark__ yup :)
[03:55:52] <Mark__> Vipii: um,the code you gave me… doesn’t exactly do anything does it?http://jsfiddle.net/lucuma/84j5S/2/
[03:56:14] <Mark__> it’s just a div thrown out there.
[04:01:08] <jalnt> Mark__: Are you asking how to show some different content (like a loading indicator) until the AJAX call is complete
[04:01:09] <jalnt> ?
[04:01:26] <Mark__> yes. precisely.
[04:01:27] <Mark__> sec.
[04:01:32] <Mark__> https://www.behance.net/
[04:01:34] <Mark__> this site has it
[04:01:36] <jalnt> Because that is quite simple, you use .then()
[04:02:01] <jalnt> I'll link you, one sec
[04:02:06] <Mark__> thanks.
[04:02:28] <jalnt> https://api.jquery.com/deferred.then/
[04:03:11] <jalnt> I can never remember the exact syntax
[04:03:22] <jalnt> But I think you basically do this
[04:03:23] <Mark__> hmm.
[04:03:50] <Mark__> might have to look up for ajax loader then..
[04:03:54] <Mark__> thanks though
[04:05:13] <jalnt> $.get("url", function(data) { /* do something with data */ }).then(function(data) { /* do something afterwards */ });
[04:08:01] <Mark__> urgg..
[04:08:34] <Mark__> anyone have an idea how to apply the jquery preloader (or ajax) to this code? http://jsfiddle.net/x8q6y865/
[04:22:04] <jalnt> Mark__: Actually I don't think you need to anything special
[04:22:16] <Mark__> *need to anything special?
[04:22:23] <jalnt> to do
[04:22:44] <Mark__> yeah. that’s exactly what im doing now
[04:22:48] <Mark__> not doing anything.
[04:22:57] <Mark__> i found this one though http://jsfiddle.net/jveldboom/c73MQ/2/
[04:23:06] <Mark__> i can’t add my code to that.
[04:23:27] <Mark__> http://jsfiddle.net/jveldboom/c73MQ/
[04:23:59] <jalnt> When you make an ajax call with $.get() or $.post() or whatever, then code you put in the function will always run after the call is finished
[04:24:24] <jalnt> So just run a function that makes the loader show up *before* you make the ajax call
[04:26:15] <Mark__> okay that’s not working. i give up lol
[04:28:47] <jalnt> Mark__: http://jsfiddle.net/mjf5dugr/
[04:30:52] <jalnt> that fiddle you posted is working for me btw
[04:30:57] <jalnt> what is the problem with it?
[04:31:20] <Mark__> um, i just dont’ know how i should add my code into it
[04:31:21] <Mark__> http://jsfiddle.net/x8q6y865/
[04:31:25] <Mark__> i have a question,
[04:31:34] <Mark__> why is there post and load ?
[04:31:42] <Mark__> can’t load just load that data by itself?
[04:32:02] <Mark__> but that’s not the main question,
[04:32:14] <Mark__> how do i make this work.?
[04:32:25] <Mark__> http://jsfiddle.net/mjf5dugr/1/
[04:32:31] <Mark__> anyone?
[04:32:44] <Mark__> sorry, im so newbie learner.
[04:44:06] <_rollingWolf> I got a couple of divs, all have the same hover and click events attached to them, the hover just makes sure all are looking the same when hovered, but the clickevent for some reason gets the event from the hover event so event.clientx and event.cilenty is for the first div rather than the one actually clicked
[04:45:17] <_rollingWolf> event.clientx/y is like ive clicked the first div rather than the one I click*
[04:46:30] <_rollingWolf> So for some reason on('click', function(hovereventinsteadofclickeventpassed) {
[04:48:44] <_rollingWolf> hmm, stackoverflow tells me im not the only with this problem
[04:50:46] <HyP3r> Hey all I'm just having problems with jquery mobile and a file upload form
[04:51:22] <HyP3r> Just a simple upload form: http://pastebin.com/4bTZVPHZ
[04:51:33] <HyP3r> I control it with jQuery (submit and so on) its hidden
[04:51:57] <HyP3r> but jquery mobile forces the form to a normal application/x-www-form-urlencoded not
[04:52:04] <HyP3r> multipart/form-data
[04:52:06] <HyP3r> but why?
[05:03:25] <motaka2> Hello how can I change this https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c86c73a584b4698634c7 so I can get an array with twiced members?
[05:03:35] <HyP3r> Obviously jQuery Mobile changes all forms
[05:35:21] <jalnt> Mark__: Didn't you write that code?
[05:35:33] <Mark__> um, i didn’t write them all
[05:35:41] <Mark__> some. i might have
[05:35:50] <Mark__> idk, but right now im moved onto other things,
[05:36:04] <Mark__> how do i make a div flip when i hover over it do you know?
[05:36:22] <Mark__>   transform: rotate(180deg);    this doesn’t seem to work,
[05:36:26] <Mark__> i’m going to css
[05:36:39] <jalnt> So are you saying you just copied and pasted that code from somewhere?
[05:37:00] <Mark__> the code came from the CMS
[05:37:04] <Mark__> which i didn’t write.
[05:37:24] <Mark__> but i dont think I copy and pasted
[05:37:55] <jalnt> well you were saying before that you didn't know how to add your own code to it
[05:38:16] <jalnt> I think you should try to understand what the code is doing before you try to modify it
[05:38:24] <jalnt> Or rewrite yourself
[05:39:09] <jalnt> what do you mean by "flip"?
[05:40:14] <Mark__> literally flip. like 180 degree
[05:40:15] <Mark__> sec
[05:41:14] <jalnt> yeah, but be more specific
[05:41:42] <jalnt> do you want an animation?
[05:42:03] <jalnt> like a 3d animated "flip"?
[05:45:37] <Mark__> oh yeah
[05:45:42] <Mark__> do you know something about it?
[05:46:23] <Mark__> http://codepen.io/hakimel/pen/ZYRgwB
[05:47:14] <d3m0n> Can .closest() selector be a sibling or only able to travese up through the dom
[05:47:47] <Uhkis> d3m0n: siblings() is for siblings ;)
[05:48:01] <d3m0n> Wasn't really my question ;)
[05:48:06] <d3m0n> Cause I need to select either or
[05:48:12] <d3m0n> Could be sibling or parent
[05:48:30] <d3m0n> Thought closest could solve that problem
[06:39:24] <hellyeah> hey
[06:40:23] <hellyeah> is there an event in jquery for holding button i can scroll up and down with that example. But i also i want to be able to hold up and down button for scroll up and down https://jsfiddle.net/raxwa4br/6/ . Any advice?
[07:44:59] <matthewbe> hi
[07:45:23] <taplar> morning
[07:45:32] <matthewbe> why isn't touchstart included in the doc about events? http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[07:46:25] <taplar> it may be in the jquery mobile docs instead
[07:46:48] <matthewbe> taplar, so if I use the standard jquery library on an ipad, i can't have the touchstart function? :(
[07:46:56] <matthewbe> *event
[07:47:13] <taplar> sure
[07:47:37] <taplar> $(selector).on('touchstart', eventHandler);
[07:48:07] <taplar> it just doesn't appear to have a wrapper function like click
[08:52:51] <Mark__> is anybody home?
[08:55:32] <Mark__> i applied this js plugin that counts number,and in the fiddle it works fine, yet,if i implement it in my webpage, it fails to function. anybody know the reason why? http://aishek.github.io/jquery-animateNumber/
[09:00:58] <Torrone> hello
[09:02:23] <Torrone> how do I filter an array so that I only get the elements with an index such as "array[0], array[10]" and not "array['foo'], array['bar']"?
[10:35:54] <ciss> hi, i've noticed that on browsers that support the <picture> element, jquery will only return the currently active source element. is there a workaround for this behavior, or should i just deal with it?
[10:46:48] <Es0teric> does anyone here know how to search through a haystack of json objects and return the objects that match the value from a key?
[10:50:15] <ciss> Es0teric: why not just write a quick recursive helper?
[10:50:24] <Es0teric> ciss a what?
[10:50:55] <jphase> Es0teric: just use .grep perhaps:  http://jsfiddle.net/59v0ye5g/
[10:51:45] <ciss> Es0teric: a flat or nested collection of objects?
[10:52:02] <Es0teric> its a flat collection
[10:52:04] <Es0teric> ciss
[10:52:48] <ciss> .grep() seems like a good fit, then
[10:53:36] <Es0teric> ciss  what if i want to target a nested array inside of the key/value pairs of the objects that i retrieved?
[10:53:53] <Es0teric> and thanks, jphase i will look at this
[10:54:17] <jphase> Es0teric: np - to do nested just do your own conditional checking inside .each()
[10:54:35] <Es0teric> jphase ah, gotcha
[10:54:48] <jphase> (safely) so that it doesn't throw errors when values/properties aren't set
[11:03:31] <workerbeetwo> Hi. how do I get the text of an input which has the specific value of the naem attribute. I tried: <script type="text/javascript">
[11:03:34] <workerbeetwo> jQuery(document).ready(function(){
[11:03:36] <workerbeetwo>    console.log('reg me page.');
[11:03:39] <workerbeetwo>    jQuery('#bigsubmitbtn').on('click', function (){
[11:03:41] <workerbeetwo>    console.log('reg me clicked');
[11:03:44] <workerbeetwo>     var name = "testname";
[11:03:46] <workerbeetwo>     var firstname = "testfirsname";
[11:03:49] <workerbeetwo>     var email= "testemail" ;
[11:03:51] <workerbeetwo>     var gender = "w";
[11:03:53] <thinkxl> workerbeetwo dude, don't paste code here, use pastebin or something
[11:03:54] <workerbeetwo>     window.open("_blank",   "https://www.citeecar.com/Home/Signup/YIELD?gender=" + gender  );
[11:03:57] <workerbeetwo>   });
[11:03:59] <workerbeetwo> });
[11:04:11] <workerbeetwo> thinkxl: sorry. Did not mean to actually.
[11:05:22] <workerbeetwo> actually just this: which I tried: var firstname = jQuery("input[name=firstname_field]").first().text();
[11:06:32] <jphase> workerbeetwo: firstly, there's no need to use .first if there's only one input
[11:06:41] <jphase> secondly, you grab the value of an input with .val() not .text()
[11:06:49] <workerbeetwo> jphase I also tried without of course.
[11:07:20] <workerbeetwo> jphase well. the value attribute is empty even though the user typed in stuff.
[11:07:31] <thinkxl> workerbeetwo create a jsfiddle or jsbin with the code
[11:13:38] <workerbeetwo> thinkxl: here it is http://jsfiddle.net/4c7zc4m8/4/
[11:25:01] <workerbeetwo> thinkxl: thinkxl ok. now you can see the problem here: http://jsfiddle.net/4c7zc4m8/9/
[11:27:34] <thinkxl> workerbeetwo one way to do it is
[11:27:40] <thinkxl> `$('input').attr('name', 'name_field').val();`
[11:29:00] <thinkxl> `var $fieldName = $('input').atr('name', 'name_field');` and reference it as `$fieldName.val();`
[11:29:02] <thinkxl> for reusability
[11:33:33] <workerbeetwo> thinkxl: well this sets all inputs name to the last of them that is set. it deosnt select the fields by name.
[11:35:37] <thinkxl> workerbeetwo I didn't understand that
[11:36:11] <thinkxl> but try like this: http://jsbin.com/qanivogonu/2/edit?js,console,output
[11:36:23] <workerbeetwo> thinkxl: the $('input').attr('name','name_filed')  does not select the input with that attribute.
[11:36:34] <workerbeetwo> it is setting its value instead
[11:36:44] <thinkxl> it does on my example
[11:37:55] <thinkxl> workerbeetwo try the last link I pasted
[11:38:55] <workerbeetwo> thinkxl: that doesnt even run. can you fiddle on mine?
[11:39:18] <thinkxl> lol
[11:39:23] <workerbeetwo> http://jsfiddle.net/4c7zc4m8/12/
[11:41:18] <thinkxl> workerbeetwo oh I got what you saying, one sec
[11:45:09] <thinkxl> workerbeetwo https://jsfiddle.net/brz3tyjh/
[11:45:14] <thinkxl> use `.val()`;
[11:45:23] <thinkxl> `.val();`
[11:47:46] <workerbeetwo> thinkxl: ah yes. thats it. thank you very much. so using .text was wrong after all.
[11:48:12] <thinkxl> yes, the first answer you got in here was right
[11:49:24] <workerbeetwo> yes, emberassing. but I Was sceptical because the value attr was empty all a long, so I did not dare getting it.
[12:00:20] <workerbeetwo> thank you jphase
[12:01:03] <jphase> np
[13:27:22] <LindsayMac> Has anyone encountered an issue where window.resize only seems to work when you're making the window smaller and not when you're making it larger? Is that typical?
[13:31:37] <grimgrin> hello guys
[13:31:48] <grimgrin> i got some blogger/jquery problem
[13:32:06] <grimgrin> can anyone help? blogger experience wanted
[13:37:26] <mod> Hello. Is there a way I could pop open an email window (as the behavior of a mailto: link) AND cause the page to redirect?
[13:37:45] <mod> to some other URL, different from the current page and the mailto:
[13:39:27] <JohnDoe2> mod setTimeout() on the anchor, the OS will take care of the mailto() action, and jquery will take care of navigating to the next page
[13:39:50] <mod> yeah, was just thinking about that
[13:40:12] <mod> putting two window.location.hrefs in a row doesn't work :)
[13:40:29] <mod> thanks!
[13:41:01] <JohnDoe2> yup
[13:47:03] <LindsayMac> Gonna ask my question again... Does anyone know if (window).resize specifically only works when making your screen smaller and not bigger? I have a script that does some image swapping based on size of the window that works flawlessly on downsize but not on upsize
[13:47:53] <mod> Can't say that I recall a restriction like that or tested that intentionally.  Have you tested multiple browsers/os?
[13:48:11] <LindsayMac> Was just about to say I only tested in Chrome.. about to test in others
[13:49:22] <LindsayMac> I had noticed a similar thing happening on another site as well
[13:53:17] <exactp> Am I reading this correctly that .prop("checked", true) is the proper way to "check" a checkbox ?
[13:57:32] <civpro> if i set a getElementById by specifying the name of the span
[13:57:42] <civpro> can i do something like this to copy the text
[13:57:43] <civpro> $(LastUpdate).html = $(FirstLog).html;
[13:57:44] <civpro> ?
[13:58:15] <civpro> if not then is there a different way?
[13:58:27] <mod> you look like your mixing and matching a few things
[13:58:38] <mod> if you're going to raw javascript, you're probably looking for .innerHtml
[13:58:52] <exactp> repost: Am I reading this correctly that .prop("checked", true) is the proper way to "check" a checkbox ?
[13:59:15] <mod> if you're using jquery, you probably one  $('selector1').html( $('selector2').html() );
[13:59:27] <civpro> im using jquery
[13:59:38] <civpro> but raw javascript isnt out of the question
[13:59:39] <mod> s/ one / want /
[13:59:53] <civpro> i cant do $('selector1') because the name is dynamic
[14:00:14] <civpro> so before that i did a var FirstLog = document.getElementById(Name + "_Log1");
[14:00:26] <mod> a dynamically named element doesn't preclude you from getting its jquery object
[14:00:29] <civpro> Name being the dynamic variable
[14:00:57] <civpro> ok so i can specify it just like above directly in without specifying the getElementById?
[14:00:59] <exactp> Okay well I'll just ask a friend once he signs on.  Appreciate it anyway :)
[14:01:24] <civpro> like $(Name + '_Log1').html
[14:01:38] <mod> exactp, use the method given with the docs for your jquery version
[14:01:57] <mod> $(Name + '_Log1').html()
[14:02:01] <mod> parentheses...
[14:02:05] <civpro> ok thanks!
[14:03:13] <exactp> mod, why would anyone use a version other than the most current stable?
[14:03:19] <civpro> mod, just to make sure this looks correct   $(Name + '_LastUpdate').html($(Name + '_Log1').html());
[14:05:13] <civpro> something is wrong, still not copying from one into the other
[14:06:07] <choosegoose> I'm passing an object in the format returned by .serializeArray() to .param(), and objects with array values are being serialized 'key=val1&val2" rather than 'key[]=val1&key[]=val2'
[14:06:11] <mod> exactp, legacy, new bug, dropped functionality, laziness, comfort-zone, paranoia, boss-said-so
[14:06:59] <civpro> mod, any idea what i am doing wrong?
[14:07:38] <Sal> hi
[14:07:47] <mod> civpro, from your posted snippets, I gather you've got a bunch of confusing or conflicting things going on in your code and your understand of the relationship between javascript and jquery.
[14:08:23] <exactp> LMAO it would help if I created a form so that my ajax could return the values requested and be able to check the checkboxes
[14:08:28] <Sal> can someone lead me to a good plugin skeleton that can multiple istances and also have methods?
[14:08:35] <exactp> Thanks for the help civ
[14:08:35] <civpro> im trying to take the text from 1 span and copy it into the text of another span
[14:08:38] <civpro> the innerHtml
[14:08:46] <exactp> Thanks for the help mod - sorry civ.
[14:09:06] <mod> civpro, what I showed you sould work every time
[14:09:26] <jphase> Sal: http://debuggable.com/posts/how-to-write-jquery-plugins:4f72ab2e-7310-4a74-817a-0a04cbdd56cb
[14:09:27] <civpro> what i pasted in is what you showed me correct?
[14:09:29] <civpro> $(Name + '_LastUpdate').html($(Name + '_Log1').html());
[14:09:40] <mod> if that really is the current name of the container you want to get the innerds from, it should work
[14:09:46] <mod> if it really exists at that moment
[14:09:52] <civpro> yes it does, i have checked
[14:09:58] <civpro> both span elements exist
[14:09:59] <mod> how have you checked?
[14:10:06] <civpro> f12 in browser
[14:10:14] <mod> and you put breakpoints in?
[14:10:18] <civpro> looking at the network tab of the refreshed content
[14:10:22] <mod> and stepped through the code?
[14:10:30] <Sal> jphase, thanks
[14:10:44] <civpro> i cant seem to get the highlighting to work anymore in my browser
[14:10:54] <civpro> before i could highlight over the variables and see the output
[14:11:10] <mod> then print it to the console
[14:11:17] <civpro> i can setup breakpoints in sources
[14:11:20] <civpro> ok i can do that
[14:11:32] <civpro> ill respond back with what i have found out
[14:11:37] <mod> sweet :)
[14:11:44] * mod needs to go rough up his intern
[14:13:58] <civpro> mod, Name is showing up correctly
[14:14:03] <civpro> however
[14:14:05] <choosegoose> for the first code block here: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.param/ if the 'value' is an array, it is serialized as key=val1&val2 instead of key[]=val1%2Ckey[]=val2, anyone know how to fix that?
[14:14:24] <civpro> $(Name + '_LastUpdate').html() is coming up undefined
[14:14:43] <civpro> it does show $(Name + '_LastUpdate') as an object
[14:15:32] <civpro> same with Log1
[14:16:42] <civpro> is there anything else i can try?
[14:17:33] <mod> Without really pouring over your code, I really cannot say.  There could be a thousand things going on. A tiny typo.
[14:17:45] <mod> (and I'm not going to do that :)
[14:18:16] <civpro> that is why i pasted the 1 line i have modified
[14:18:25] <civpro> $('selector1').html( $('selector2').html() );  <-- that is what you gave me
[14:18:47] <civpro> $(Name + '_LastUpdate').html($(Name + '_Log1').html());
[14:18:51] <civpro> that is what i wrote
[14:19:05] <civpro> even statically assigning name in the console brings back the same result
[14:19:46] <civpro> are there alternatives to .html() ?

[17:16:54] <robertmaxrees> lyhr there are a lot of choices.
[17:17:01] <robertmaxrees> depends on what you’re changing.
[17:17:24] <lyhr> i would like to remove Content and replace it with new content
[17:17:31] <robertmaxrees> what is “content”?
[17:17:35] <robertmaxrees> is it text?  markup?
[17:17:42] <robertmaxrees> another jquery node?
[17:17:49] <lyhr> sorry current content is just text and a link I want to replace it with just text
[17:17:54] <robertmaxrees> .text()
[17:19:01] <lyhr> looking at that function thanks robertmaxrees
[17:19:06] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:22:59] <jak2000> robertmaxrees recommendme some to reading about
[17:33:10] <jak2000> robertmaxrees recommendme some to reading about
[17:33:29] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[17:33:36] <robertmaxrees> 1 why are you barking orders at me?
[17:33:38] <robertmaxrees> 2 about what?
[17:35:34] <z1haze> whats wrong with this: $(e.trigger).find('.copy').animate({ "left": "-110%" }, "fast").delay( 200 ).animate({ "left": "13px" }, "fast");
[17:35:48] <robertmaxrees> why not $(this).find()?
[17:35:51] <robertmaxrees> etc
[17:36:35] <matthewbe> hi
[17:36:43] <z1haze> because the plugin says use trigger
[17:36:47] <matthewbe> it seems that this line doesn't work on iPad: $(menu).css({ top: y, left: x }).fadeIn(150);
[17:36:50] <matthewbe> is it possible?
[17:36:51] <robertmaxrees> z1haze okay, then no idea.
[17:36:52] <z1haze> i more or less meant the delay() part
[17:39:42] <jak2000> robertmaxrees escuse me
[17:39:59] <jak2000> is possible with jQuery, set default printer in the browser?
[17:39:59] <jak2000> before show the dialog print?
[17:40:12] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 “set default printer in the browser”
[17:40:19] <robertmaxrees> like, change what printer the user can use?
[17:41:01] <jak2000> not
[17:41:53] <jak2000> i have 5 printers. one of these was set default printer, right?  programatillay i want change the default printer...
[17:42:10] <robertmaxrees> that’s literally what i just said.
[17:42:13] <robertmaxrees> and no, you cannot do that.
[17:47:04] <jak2000> ok
[18:02:31] <royalty> has anyone here used chart.js?
[18:02:33] <royalty> http://jsfiddle.net/5b2wg6dy/1/
[18:02:43] <royalty> I'm having issues rendering different charts
[18:02:50] <royalty> and having them saved as png
[18:03:02] <royalty> I think the issue is that it saves to png before it gets a chance to render...
[18:03:20] <royalty> right now data is filling up the form values... but
[18:03:27] <royalty> the data filling it up is an empty png
[18:04:28] <robertmaxrees> where does the print call happen?
[18:05:36] <robertmaxrees> welp
[18:06:22] <royalty> i'm just trying to send the data over
[18:06:31] <robertmaxrees> so what does that have to do with printing?
[18:06:49] <royalty> robertmaxrees, the problem isn't the printing, the problem is just the chart data as png
[18:07:01] <robertmaxrees> then try re-explaining the issue.
[18:07:28] <royalty> alright so i want to go through each .chartPng
[18:07:37] <royalty> which is simply a hidden form input
[18:07:42] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:07:49] <royalty> and i want to fill those form inputs with image base 64 data for each chart
[18:08:07] <royalty> so i am trying to make one chart
[18:08:12] <royalty> and re-render it several times
[18:08:37] <royalty> and after each render save the canvas snapshot to png with toDataURL
[18:08:45] <robertmaxrees> looks like they have a callback for the the .done
[18:09:04] <royalty> hmmmmm
[18:09:08] <royalty> i was reading the docs
[18:09:14] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/20206119/923919
[18:10:07] <royalty> robertmaxrees, what a baller, they didnt' have that in the docs...
[18:10:12] <royalty> nice find!
[18:10:16] <robertmaxrees> what’s this chart for?
[18:10:30] <royalty> our clients might have many domains
[18:10:39] <royalty> it's basically showing google analytics data
[18:10:45] <royalty> for each of their domains
[18:10:54] <robertmaxrees> so the phrase “retardChart” was totally unnecessary?
[18:11:02] <royalty> yeah because i hated the task
[18:11:04] <royalty> so i called it that
[18:11:13] <robertmaxrees> so next time you’re in here, I’d suggest NOT using that word that way ;)(
[18:11:15] <royalty> i thought it was unintuitive what i was doing
[18:11:37] <royalty> yeah thanks for your politically correct, semantic coding tips
[18:11:51] <robertmaxrees> that’s actually something we encourage in the channel in general
[18:12:07] <royalty> i know i was just giving you a bit of a hard time
[18:12:23] <royalty> i won't name it that next time, thanks
[18:12:31] <robertmaxrees> that doesn’t make your behavior OK ;) anyway - glad you figured it out.
[18:31:19] <royalty> robertmaxrees, i renamded it to flipper-canvas now because you flip through charts
[18:31:22] <royalty> in case you were wondering
[18:31:40] <royalty> i hope you feel warmer and fuzzier inside now
[18:32:23] <robertmaxrees> i was mostly telling you that for your benefit - it’s against the rules to use derogatory language like that.  that’s all.
[18:33:18] <royalty> oh ok
[18:33:29] <robertmaxrees> no need to be rude toward me about it.
[18:33:52] * royalty hugs robertmaxrees 
[18:35:32] <royalty> robertmaxrees, it's working!!!!
[20:24:41] <Mark__> why doesnt this work?http://jsfiddle.net/2twm3fuk/
[20:25:16] <robertmaxrees> jQuery('.read_number').animateNumber({ number: {$oDocument->get('readed_count')} }); uh
[20:25:20] <robertmaxrees> coffeescript?
[20:26:02] <Mark__> um.
[20:26:08] <Mark__> animatenumber.
[20:26:16] <Mark__> http://aishek.github.io/jquery-animateNumber/
[20:26:16] <robertmaxrees> $oDocument->get('readed_count') -> is not a valid js operator.
[20:26:23] <Mark__> oh that's
[20:26:28] <Mark__> from my CMS
[20:26:32] <Mark__> it works fine btw.
[20:26:35] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[20:26:44] <Mark__> im just trying to select dynamically added elements.
[20:27:00] <robertmaxrees> then i have no idea how to help without seeing actual valid js.
[20:27:07] <Mark__> yeah. thanks
[20:27:22] <Mark__> i just thought i might have done something wrong with the closing
[20:27:29] <Mark__> as this is my first expeirence with jquery
[20:27:33] <robertmaxrees> there’s no way to tell without seeing your code.
[20:27:41] <Mark__> ohwell
[20:27:45] <Mark__> if you are down for it i guess..
[20:27:56] <robertmaxrees> jsut the rendered version of what you gavbe me.
[20:27:58] <robertmaxrees> not the whole site.
[20:28:23] <Mark__> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/htmlcss
[20:28:29] <Mark__> if you click on the thumbnails,
[20:28:34] <Mark__> it will open up a layer
[20:28:34] <robertmaxrees> just the code you sent me earlier.
[20:28:36] <robertmaxrees> not the whole site.
[20:28:54] <Mark__> but i can’t generate the same problem using jsfiddle
[20:29:03] <robertmaxrees> doesn’t matter?
[20:29:10] <Mark__> i have already tried jsfiddle and it worked fine.
[20:29:15] <Mark__> but thanks for your help..
[20:29:16] <robertmaxrees> lol then i dunno mang.
[20:29:30] <robertmaxrees> check your console for errors.  otherwise, fixingthesejquery.com is a pretty good guide.
[20:29:54] <Mark__> okay.
[20:29:59] <Mark__> btw, since you are here,
[20:30:03] <Mark__> can i ask one more question?
[20:30:07] <robertmaxrees> you already did ;)
[20:30:12] <robertmaxrees> (of course, that’s why the channel exists)
[20:30:19] <Mark__> thanks.
[20:30:49] <Mark__> do you know which code i can use it for the ‘preloader img’ that appears until the ajax post or load is done?
[20:31:01] <Mark__> i’ll give you my code
[20:31:33] <Mark__> http://jsfiddle.net/2twm3fuk/1/
[20:31:55] <Mark__> i just don’t know which code i should use for
[20:32:04] <Mark__> creating something like this https://www.behance.net/
[20:32:15] <Mark__> if you click on the thumbnails of each article
[20:32:23] <Mark__> the preloader appears.
[20:32:47] <robertmaxrees> right, and then disappears.
[20:32:51] <Mark__> right.
[20:33:10] <robertmaxrees> so normally you have a generic spinner icon inside of a div somewhere on your page.
[20:33:15] <robertmaxrees> you then show and hide that.
[20:33:38] <robertmaxrees> i usually give it a class called “hide” and set that in my CSS you display: none; and then add and remove that class to toggle it.
[20:33:50] <Mark__> right.
[20:33:58] <robertmaxrees> you hide the spinner in the .done() callback.
[20:34:00] <Mark__> but do you know the code i can use inside the onclick events
[20:34:10] <Mark__> hmm i don’tknow how to do that.
[20:34:16] <Mark__> but certainly i will look up for it
[20:34:22] <robertmaxrees> $(‘.someElement’).removeClass(‘hide’);
[20:34:40] <robertmaxrees> and then $.ajax().done(function() { $(‘.someElement’).addClass(‘hide’) });
[20:34:56] <robertmaxrees> where $.ajax() is whatever your real ajax call is - replace that part with your current ajax.
[20:35:14] <robertmaxrees> also don’t use onclick in your html ever
[20:35:19] <Mark__> oh.. looks like it’s a complicated job
[20:35:22] <Mark__> yeah i did that
[20:35:29] <Mark__> only because it’s dynamically added
[20:35:29] <robertmaxrees> it’s not complicated at all.
[20:35:30] <robertmaxrees> very easy
[20:35:36] <Mark__> and otherwise the function doesn’t work
[20:35:37] <Mark__> so...
[20:35:41] <robertmaxrees> sure it does.
[20:35:45] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation instead.
[20:35:48] <robertmaxrees> you’re already part of the way there.
[20:35:58] <Mark__> im telling you my CMS didn’t work it that way
[20:36:01] <Mark__> i’ve tried everyway.
[20:36:06] <robertmaxrees> then you did something wrong.
[20:36:07] <robertmaxrees> bummer.
[20:36:13] <Mark__> otherwise it had to be done using js.
[20:36:15] <Mark__> anyways
[20:36:18] <Mark__> thanks for your help
[20:36:21] <robertmaxrees> right, you use a delegated listener in your JS>
[20:58:45] <Mark__> can someone apply the ajax preloader into this code? http://jsfiddle.net/2twm3fuk/2/ anyone help me out?
[22:11:11] <jquery887> hello there good morning

[22:43:55] <jquery887> anyone there please\
[22:50:22] <d3m0n> Can someone tell me how I can seperate the spec_val var to each it's own object? http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/dYBOeK?editors=101
[23:17:06] <d3m0n> Or perhaps point me in the right directinom
[23:17:10] <d3m0n> direction*
[23:29:37] <Zak> is it reliable to assume that: typeof jQuery.fn.jquery === 'string'   will always be true?
