[00:20:25] <Starcraftmazter> hi\m
[00:20:30] <Starcraftmazter> my date picker is showing by default
[00:20:32] <Starcraftmazter> why would tha tbe
[00:21:47] <d3m0n> How would I go about coding a abs pos element inside another element to follow while scrolling to emulate abs fixed
[00:22:09] <d3m0n> It cant be fixed as I want it to stay inside the element
[00:22:20] <d3m0n> Having a hard time finding key words to google
[00:34:53] <woodrag1> the autocomplete function does not work anymore after an upgrade to the lastest jquery ui. Firefox says.... TypeError: $(...).autocomplete is not a function but i have imported all the modules..... Anyone who can give me hint? The same counts form the datepicker....
[00:36:18] <Cork> woodrag1: any other errors?
[00:36:28] <woodrag1> Cork: Nope
[00:36:36] <Cork> cause that error means the autocomplete lib hasn't been loaded at all
[00:36:51] <Cork> so $.fn.autocomplete === undefined
[00:38:27] <woodrag1> the function is loaded within the $(document).ready(function() section
[00:40:12] <d3m0n> http://jsfiddle.net/Vx68q/
[00:41:36] <Cork> woodrag1: loaded?
[00:41:37] <Cork> no
[00:41:47] <Cork> called possible, but you don't load code in .ready normally
[00:43:28] <woodrag1> Cork: the automplete function is written within the $(document).ready(function() section.... correct?
[00:43:36] <Cork> no
[00:43:51] <Cork> the call to USE it is there
[00:43:52] <woodrag1> It worked in the previous version
[00:44:04] <Cork> the declaration is in the lib that adds the feature
[00:44:16] <woodrag1> Ok
[00:44:33] <Cork> so make sure the lib you include actually have autocomplete as part of it
[00:45:47] <woodrag1> i call /js/jquery-ui-1.10.4/ui/jquery.ui.autocomplete.js in my main page
[00:46:51] <woodrag1> should i move forward to the  jquery 2.1.0 ?
[00:51:42] <d3m0n> How would I get the second money to only start when it hit's it div - http://jsfiddle.net/Vx68q/1/
[00:51:48] <d3m0n> menu*
[00:52:00] <d3m0n> it's parent div* sorry
[00:55:30] <d3m0n> Since there are two elements jquery is selecting and grabbing data from them, it seems it's only allowing for the first value
[00:56:19] <Cork> d3m0n: $parent.height() == $parent.eq(0).height()
[00:56:34] <Cork> so you need to loop the $parent variable
[01:02:30] <woodrag1> which lib should i call to be able to use the autocomplete function in the latest jquery ?
[01:05:57] <xKraty> woodrag1: be sure it's included in the package you downloaded
[01:06:09] <xKraty> woodrag1: you can make a custom  pack from download page
[01:06:37] <woodrag1> xKraty: In jquery-ui ?
[01:06:51] <xKraty> woodrag1: yes
[01:06:58] <woodrag1> Ok
[01:07:03] <woodrag1> thank you
[01:07:17] <xKraty> woodrag1: http://jqueryui.com/download/
[01:08:08] <d3m0n> Cork: So jquery selectors to apply itself to each selected elements itself and apply/grab the needed data?
[01:08:20] <d3m0n> don't apply*
[01:08:37] <Cork> ?api height
[01:08:48] <Cork> <_<
[01:08:55] <d3m0n> It's not the height, it's the offset I believe
[01:08:58] * Cork kicks the bot
[01:09:09] <d3m0n> Don't know if that makes a difference
[01:09:27] <Cork> d3m0n: basically functions that return a value and not a standard jquery object all operate on the first element in the list
[01:09:42] <d3m0n> Gotcha
[01:10:07] <Cork> so most functions operate on the full match
[01:10:25] <Cork> but there is a few examples where the api would break if you returned more then one of them
[01:10:39] <Cork> like .val(), .height(), .offset() and so on
[01:22:50] <d3m0n> Cork: Am I headed in the right direction: http://jsfiddle.net/Vx68q/2/ ?
[01:23:27] <Cork> no
[01:23:36] <d3m0n> Lol
[01:23:37] <Cork> cause you still just check the first element
[01:23:40] <woodrag1> xKraty: I have download the custom pack with all functions but i still get the error
[01:24:00] <xKraty> woodrag1: could you provide a gist with the code?
[01:24:14] <woodrag1> gist ?
[01:24:22] <Cork> d3m0n: 1. that code leaves $parentHeight undefined as you define it in the each loop
[01:24:24] <d3m0n> Even if it's doing an 'each' of the menu classes
[01:24:41] <Cork> 2. you will still have just one value as you would have overwritten the old if it wasn't local
[01:26:26] <Cork> so what is it your trying to do exactly?
[01:26:45] <Cork> move the menu element as long as the parent is in view?
[01:27:22] <d3m0n> I am trying to get the 'Menu' to emulate position fixed but stay inside it's parent div.
[01:27:55] <Cork> d3m0n: well you would basically have to rewrite most of this code
[01:28:20] <Cork> first you have to base it on the "$parent" variable (that should be named parents
[01:28:22] <d3m0n> So when my scroll hits the top of the second div the second menu starts to be fixed
[01:28:39] <Cork> and on each scroll event you need to loop this variable (.each) and check if the element is in view
[01:28:48] <Cork> if it is in view you need to find the .menu element inside it
[01:28:50] <woodrag1> xKraty: http://jsfiddle.net/rhyVS/
[01:28:51] <Cork> and move it
[01:29:04] <Cork> you can't really do this the way you have right now
[01:29:26] <Cork> d3m0n: also you should note that constantly moving elements with js won't work well when the page is scrolled
[01:29:35] <Cork> it WILL lag specially on mobile deviced
[01:30:25] <Cork> better option is often to use position: fixed; when the elements goes out of view
[01:30:38] <Cork> that way you only have to handle hiding it again when it shouldn't be visible
[01:30:47] <xKraty> woodrag1: you shoul'd need to reinclude libs since you got the custom jquery-ui-1.10.4.custom.min.js
[01:30:48] <Cork> (so no lag on moving the element)
[01:31:59] <d3m0n> Hrmmm
[01:32:08] <woodrag1> which libs shoul i reinclude?
[01:32:11] <woodrag1> which libs should i reinclude?
[01:32:49] <Cork> woodrag1: if you include the full jquery ui it would be there
[01:33:02] <Cork> if you use a custom one you need to check the autocomplete plugin in the list
[01:33:08] <xKraty> woodrag1: you also include twice the jquery
[01:33:42] <xKraty> woodrag1: http://jsfiddle.net/rhyVS/1/
[01:33:53] <xKraty> woodrag1: that's should be enough
[01:34:29] <Cork> xKraty: depends on what is in the custom js file
[01:34:50] <Cork> and as it can be any level or stripped down, you don't know that
[01:35:02] <xKraty> Cork: i linked him the right page earlier
[01:35:15] <xKraty> for download
[01:35:24] <xKraty> i hope he didn't randomly unchecked things lol
[01:35:43] <Cork> well i usually use the straight download page instead :)
[01:36:01] <woodrag1> xKraty: ;-( still the same....
[01:36:03] <Cork> http://code.jquery.com/ui/
[01:36:16] <Cork> woodrag1: try using http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.3/jquery-ui.min.js
[01:36:39] <justHannes> hey folks, should i remove event listeners from elements i gonna remove or is that nonsense?
[01:36:41] * xKraty is owned
[01:36:42] <Cork> opps missed the latest version http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.4/jquery-ui.min.js
[01:37:02] <Cork> xKraty: well they are hiding it quite well
[01:37:36] <Cork> justHannes: the listeners is bound on the dom element
[01:37:47] <Cork> so when the dom element is gc:ed your listeners will be taken down too
[01:38:03] <Cork> just make sure you don't have any variable laying around pointing to the removed dom elements
[01:38:37] <justHannes> nah, its all neat and clean :)
[01:42:10] <woodrag1> xKraty: ;-( No effect.... Should i move on to 2.1.0 ?
[01:45:29] <xKraty> woodrag1: 2.1.0 is like latest jquery w/o some old support, if you don't need it you can use 2.1.0
[01:45:51] <xKraty> woodrag1: don't you have a public page?
[01:45:59] <woodrag1> nope
[01:47:11] <xKraty> woodrag1: what happen if you type $.fn.autocomplete in your browser console?
[01:55:34] <Cork> woodrag1: have you checked in the browsers console and network tab?
[01:55:59] <Cork> sounds like something is either blocking the load; or your loading additional jquery libs later overwriting the one with the autocomplete
[01:56:45] <Cork> ex. <script src="jquery-v1"><script src="jquery-ui"><script src="jquery-v2"> <-- this one will make autocomplete inaccessable
[01:57:33] <lemonsparrow> I want to remove the margin-bottom property from a table.. but $('#statusTable').css({'margin-bottom':'none'}); code isn't working
[01:57:38] <nikro> is there a jQuery Mobile channel? or should I just shoot questions here :)
[01:57:50] <Cork> $('#statusTable').css({'margin-bottom':''})
[01:58:24] <Cork> nikro: here is the correct place; though you might have to wait for someone that actually know mobile
[01:58:56] <lemonsparrow> Cork: thanks
[02:04:23] <d3m0n> Hey Cork, just curious but you said: Set a loop in the scroll to find if each element is in view, correct? Does that mean EVERY time a scroll happens that each function gets fired off?
[02:04:46] <d3m0n> that the each function*
[02:05:33] <Cork> d3m0n: yes
[02:05:42] <Cork> you have to there isn't really any other way around it
[02:05:58] <d3m0n> And as you mentions, easier to hide/show them with a fixed attribute? If I am not mistaken, you would still need use a scroll event to check if it needs to be hidden/shown?
[02:06:03] <d3m0n> mentioned*
[02:06:20] <Cork> d3m0n: it isn't easier actually, it is quite tricky
[02:06:36] <Cork> but it is a must if you want to have the text staying stable at the position in mobile
[02:06:40] <d3m0n> Is the animation what lags the system or the scroll event
[02:06:43] <Cork> as they fire the scroll event to js async
[02:06:50] <Cork> so you will lag after when the browser scrolls
[02:07:13] <Cork> no it is the browser not syncing with js as it scrolls
[02:07:19] <Cork> (it would kill scroll performance)
[02:16:00] <DelicateFlower> should i use jquery instead of plain js?
[02:16:37] <xKraty> DelicateFlower: depend what you need to do
[02:16:54] <DelicateFlower> general web stuff
[02:17:26] <xKraty> meh, i don't live anymore w/o jquery
[02:18:33] <DelicateFlower> quick question, if a load jquery and i use it in another script, how do i makesure that jquery is up and ready?
[02:21:00] <xKraty> DelicateFlower: you just include the jquery lib and you got it available everywhere after the inclusion
[02:21:41] <xKraty> DelicateFlower: you wrap it in a $(function() { }); short way for $(document).ready(function() {}); and the code get executed when the page is loaded
[02:33:55] <delboy1978uk1> whats the twhats the bootstrap channel on here? it isnt #bootstrap
[02:34:43] <Cork> delboy1978uk1: looks like it's #twitter-bootstrap
[02:35:12] <delboy1978uk1> ah thatnks Cork
[02:42:19] <Naeblis> What status code does $.ajax expect for the success function to be called?
[02:42:29] <Naeblis> (in case of type = DELETE)
[02:42:57] <Naeblis> I'm trying 204 but that isn't working
[02:53:11] <Cork> Naeblis: 2xx
[02:53:32] <Naeblis> 204 wasn't working Cork. :(
[02:53:38] <Naeblis> It works with 200
[02:55:13] <Cork> Naeblis: isSuccess = status >= 200 && status < 300 || status === 304;
[02:55:26] <Cork> that is the litteral code used
[02:55:45] <Cork> Naeblis: though success won't be called if parsing fails
[02:55:54] <Cork> so that might be what your seeing
[02:56:25] <Naeblis> hmm
[02:57:01] <d3m0n> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Vx68q/3/ - warmer?
[02:57:33] <Cork> ya
[02:58:07] <Cork> you just need to check if scrollTop() > $parent.offset().top + $parent.height()
[02:58:08] <d3m0n> It sets the fixed fine, but doesn't release or set fixed on the second one. Any suggestions
[02:58:21] <Cork> you just need to check if scrollTop() > $parent.offset().top + $parent.height() - $menu.height()
[02:58:24] <d3m0n> :)
[02:58:53] <Cork> d3m0n: btw $(this).eq(0).height() is pointless
[02:58:59] <Cork> that just results in extra work
[02:59:03] <Cork> just do $(this).height()
[02:59:20] <d3m0n> As will offset and menu
[02:59:22] <d3m0n> ?*
[02:59:27] <d3m0n> with* arghh my typing is bad today
[02:59:27] <Cork> d3m0n: also $menu   = $menus.eq(0) isn't correct
[03:00:00] <Cork> $menu = $(this).find('.menu') is prob what you want
[03:00:08] <d3m0n> k
[03:00:15] <Cork> alternatively you can do something nifty like
[03:00:37] <Cork> $parents.each(i) { var $menu = $menus.eq(i) }
[03:01:00] <Cork> though that only works if you ever only have one .menu in each parents elemetn
[03:01:04] <Cork> *element
[03:01:11] <d3m0n> Should it only should
[03:01:52] <CreaA> http://jsfiddle.net/mKCD8 can anyone help me solve this simple thing? wrapping div around img before prepend?
[03:02:01] <d3m0n> Thanks for the help Cork
[03:02:05] <Cork> np
[03:02:56] <CreaA> can u help me Cork ?
[03:04:18] <Cork> CreaA: i would just do this http://jsfiddle.net/mKCD8/1/
[03:04:58] <seutje> you would, wouldn't you?
[03:05:01] <Cork> CreaA: just a warning; remember that id's MUST be unique on the entire page
[03:05:30] <CreaA> Ill look, Cork, ill let you know :)
[03:05:43] <Cork> i rarely see the use for .wrap actually
[03:05:44] <xKraty> CreaA: like that? http://jsfiddle.net/mKCD8/2/
[03:09:05] <CreaA> Cork: yep, thanks - one sec
[03:11:09] <xKraty> CreaA: it doesn't seems to work with objects the .wrap()
[03:17:36] <delboy1978uk1> anyone using Jira here? is there a room i can join?
[03:17:36] <circ-user-eTM3c> hi, does anyone have time to discuss the wonderful word of our Lord, Jesus Christ our saviour?
[03:17:49] <circ-user-eTM3c> nah, just joking, need to discuss xmlhttp calls
[03:17:52] <circ-user-eTM3c> and multiple ones
[03:17:57] <delboy1978uk1> circ-user-eTM3c: try #hell
[03:18:03] <circ-user-eTM3c> I realise I can use the .when method
[03:18:08] <delboy1978uk1> lol
[03:18:13] <circ-user-eTM3c> but what that is not really what I want
[03:18:28] <circ-user-eTM3c> I want to call two separate asych xhr calls but with separate callbacks
[03:18:40] <circ-user-eTM3c> that is not possible with the .when
[03:19:09] <circ-user-eTM3c> I am thinking of dropping the jquery method and just write my own xhr wrapper (not hard)
[03:19:12] <xKraty> circ-user-eTM3c: every calls has is own callback function
[03:19:23] <circ-user-eTM3c> not with .when it seems
[03:19:46] <circ-user-eTM3c> and if you run two asynch xhr calls using .ajax they overwrite each other
[03:19:52] <circ-user-eTM3c> only one callback is called
[03:19:56] <xKraty> use .success
[03:20:02] <circ-user-eTM3c> yup, tested
[03:20:18] <xKraty> meh
[03:20:27] <circ-user-eTM3c> throw two asynched calls at once, one calls the success the first one returned
[03:20:39] <xKraty> i have 1 xhr request wrapped in a function
[03:20:42] <circ-user-eTM3c> so however jquery wraps it all, it's clearly using a shared variable somewhere
[03:20:47] <xKraty> and i call it even 5 times at time
[03:21:22] <circ-user-eTM3c> 5 is overkill it's also against the specs as 2 asynch is in the ECMA specs, but that is by the by, not arguing that case
[03:21:51] <circ-user-eTM3c> create a separate closure function for each xhr
[03:21:59] <circ-user-eTM3c> rather than just calling them inline?
[03:22:24] <circ-user-eTM3c> suppose, it's a solution, it's a bit of a messy solution as jQ simply shouldn't override subsequent calls
[03:22:29] <xKraty> circ-user-eTM3c: spec or not if boss wants that you have to do that lol
[03:22:57] <xKraty> in the response of each request i pass a param for the call back
[03:22:59] <circ-user-eTM3c> yeh, not arguing, I think 2 was the limit of some of the older browsers
[03:23:09] <xKraty> so i has an object with callbacks
[03:23:25] <xKraty> var callbacks = a: function() {}, b...
[03:23:27] <circ-user-eTM3c> sadly the way I've written this app it never thought to me the xhr call would use shared vars
[03:23:49] <xKraty> so in the success i call callbacks[callback]()
[03:23:52] <xKraty> and it works for me
[03:23:56] <xKraty> best workaround i found
[03:24:13] <circ-user-eTM3c> I thougth .when() would solve it, but they that really only caters for multiple xhr which then call the same action
[03:24:27] <circ-user-eTM3c> s/"then that really"
[03:24:30] <xKraty> * callbacks = { a: fn, b ... }
[03:25:15] <circ-user-eTM3c> well that isn't quite what I am looking for, I understand why you are suggesting it, I haven't given you code so that's my fault, just discussing abstract just now
[03:25:35] <circ-user-eTM3c> but, yeh, just create a closure with a new xhr call in them I suppose
[03:25:39] <circ-user-eTM3c> that'll solve it
[03:25:55] <xKraty> yeah :D
[03:26:11] <xKraty> i just don't like repeating code
[03:26:32] <circ-user-eTM3c> if I had realised the issue I would run into I wouldn't have written my app as I have
[03:26:56] <circ-user-eTM3c> basically i didn't realise I needed an extra cache of data from another DB table separate from the initial db call
[03:27:28] <xKraty> don't tell me
[03:27:30] <circ-user-eTM3c> hence the need for a second separate call, but as I say if I run then sequentially through the .ajax() method it only returns one
[03:27:38] <xKraty> i remake things 1231231 times as my boss wake up that day lol
[03:28:26] <circ-user-eTM3c> yeah, well the lord jesus our saviour said in Mark 13:16 "Oh, lord why did you test us with cunts as bosses"
[03:28:41] <circ-user-eTM3c> anyway, thanks for the time, take care and have a good one...
[03:51:08] <Error404NotFound> I have a form for which i need to do ajax post. In side the ajax post data is set to $('#' + formName).serialize() but i want to add couple of more values to it. Ideas?

[04:04:12] <Steve^> I'm looking at the 1.11.0 jquery.min.js, downloaded via npm, and it has a sourceMapping comment at the bottom.. I thought it wasn't meant to?
[04:05:34] <Steve^> Concerned that the NPM distribution is different to the main distribution...
[04:10:11] <Cork> Steve^: not sure what the problem/question is
[04:10:44] <Steve^> The jquery site release of 1.11.0 has no sourcemap comment, and the blog says it should have no sourcemap comment. But the NPM version does?
[04:11:10] <Steve^> I would have thought these files must be identical
[04:11:23] <anli_> When I hover an item in the firebug debugger, I see some information in a tooltip, can I "stick" that tooltip?
[04:11:37] <anli_> There is a more... link I cannot click
[04:15:32] <hendry> hi, my $(this).closest('.v').find('.feedback').prepend("<li>foobar</li>");  works outside of a $.post but not in... how do I fix this? http://jsfiddle.net/kaihendry/T3Q79/21/
[04:15:53] <Cork> var self = this
[04:15:56] <Cork> or var self = $(this)
[04:16:05] <Cork> outside the post and use self inside it
[04:16:29] <Cork> the callback function creates a local this variable preventing you from accessing the this variable from the parent scope
[04:16:31] <masscrx> hi
[04:17:05] <masscrx> im trying to implement global ajax error handling, this is my actual code: http://pastie.org/8748378 which doesnt work
[04:17:30] <hendry> Cork: wow, thanks. simple solution to something I've been wasting hours on.
[04:17:48] <masscrx> i have http://pastie.org/8745551#6 this code which work fine with php, but now I'm trying to implement my prev pastie with rails
[04:18:43] <gry> `this
[04:18:54] <masscrx> as I see in jquery documentation, as of ver 1.8 i should use .ajaxError() in (document)
[04:19:38] <Cork> masscrx: you can use ajaxSetup too
[04:19:45] <Cork> and i would prob go that way my self
[04:20:06] <masscrx> Cork: but this code doesnt work with rails
[04:20:07] <Cork> feels kinda silly to involve the event system in something that isn't an event
[04:20:23] <Cork> masscrx: the backend doesn't matter
[04:20:25] <masscrx> it worked like a charm with my php
[04:20:27] <masscrx> hmm
[04:20:28] <Cork> check what status the server sends
[04:20:34] <Cork> that is all you need to check
[04:21:04] <Cork> masscrx: the backend always have to generate http headers
[04:21:13] <Cork> and those are all the client have access to
[04:21:23] <Cork> so as long as you generate correct headers it should always work the same
[04:21:25] <masscrx> status 404 Not Found
[04:21:28] <masscrx> this is my header
[04:21:46] <Cork> that should result in error status==404 ya
[04:22:11] <Cork> check so there isn't something else happening
[04:22:18] <Cork> btw how do you experience the problem?
[04:22:26] <Cork> isn't the error callback called?
[04:22:56] <masscrx> I have included only this code http://pastie.org/8745551#6
[04:23:18] <masscrx> and thats all, for success i have another callback
[04:23:29] <Cork> well firstly you don't need $(function() {}) for ajaxSetup
[04:23:47] <gry> i lost a link to a good guide about 'this' and scope.. it was a good small page with dark bg suggesting to use '.bind' or 'self' etc
[04:23:52] <Cork> additionally is the error callback called at all?
[04:23:58] <masscrx> for each request i have my custom success callback
[04:24:19] <masscrx> Cork: no one work from this code, i tried with 404, 500 and etc
[04:24:30] <Cork> well is the callback called at all?
[04:24:40] <Cork> you just say you don't get the result
[04:24:45] <Cork> but is the callback triggereD?
[04:24:48] <Cork> *triggered
[04:24:52] <masscrx> how to check it ?
[04:24:59] <Cork> set a breakpoint in the code
[04:25:14] <Cork> the equiv to line 4
[04:26:25] <masscrx> to (jqXHR.status ===0) ?
[04:26:54] <Cork> you know how you add breakpoints in the browser right?
[04:27:36] <masscrx> i think so, in dev console
[04:42:56] <masscrx> Cork: it looks like that this $.ajaxSetup is not taken into account
[04:45:18] <nikro> Does anyone know the right way to load jquery & jquery mobile with requirejs, without having that unredendered-dom showing up?
[04:55:37] <ankurk_> I am trying to filter my table rows by row data-attribute, but it's not working :( https://gist.github.com/pioneersolutions/9091390
[04:55:55] <xKraty> ankurk_: lol dat table!
[04:56:18] <ankurk_> xKraty, Can't wait to get rid of this table
[04:56:30] <xKraty> i know the feeling
[04:56:51] <xKraty> if you think you'd be done already if your boss would have let you use a plugin lol
[04:56:56] <xKraty> let me check your gist
[04:58:20] <xKraty> ankurk_: can you build up a demo?
[04:58:51] <ankurk_> yep, give me a moment
[05:00:58] <ankurk_> xKraty, here you go, http://jsbin.com/nalomuje/5/edit
[05:01:11] <ankurk_> I want to filter by data-closed attribute of the tr
[05:02:01] <xKraty> so you to see the closed or not
[05:02:16] <xKraty> want*
[05:03:03] <ankurk_> yep
[05:03:12] <ankurk_> My thing is going live today
[05:03:18] <ankurk_> and damn I am scared
[05:03:50] <xKraty> lol
[05:04:05] <xKraty>  $('#project_table').find("tr :not(.hidden) td:nth-child(5)");
[05:04:11] <xKraty> what s for?
[05:04:23] <ankurk_> ignore that
[05:04:41] <ankurk_> something I forgot to comment out
[05:04:55] <xKraty> ok
[05:06:18] <ankurk_> I guess I can use this? 	if ($(this).attr('data-closed').match(data)) { ?
[05:07:02] <xKraty> hold on
[05:09:06] <nights> anyone tried this?
[05:09:06] <nights> https://www.google.co.jp/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CCQQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fhyperlapse.tllabs.io%2F&ei=5awEU6z4HYXwoATr54DgCw&usg=AFQjCNGL5zUip7kUKueeZqfPg3nOi4f47g&sig2=BZVTVsYga2CY_bqnPbVoeg&bvm=bv.61535280,d.cGU
[05:09:09] <nights> sorry
[05:09:12] <nights> fuck google
[05:09:15] <nights> hyperlapse.tllabs.io/‎
[05:09:23] <hpekdemir> does anybody have experience with mustache.js? can I use seperate html files to put my templates in?
[05:11:18] <Alphard> hi, is there some newer function that replaced the old toggle() http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/ ?
[05:12:16] <Alphard> if not, what's a good way to implement this?
[05:13:20] <seutje> Alphard: check jquery migrate, it has code to accommodate the old usage, u can prolly lift it from there and rename it to $.fn.myNewToggle or something
[05:13:53] <nikro> does anyone know requirejs here? :(
[05:14:08] <seutje> Alphard: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14301935/where-has-fn-toggle-handlereventobject-handlereventobject-gone
[05:14:50] <seutje> nikro: sure, but you'll prolly have a better chance at #requirejs
[05:15:17] <xKraty> ankurk_: http://jsbin.com/nalomuje/11/edit
[05:15:35] <xKraty> ankurk_: like that?
[05:15:42] <nikro> seutje, no one's answering there :) I need to load jquery mobile synchronously and to be able to refer to it asynchronously as well in require js definitions, how do I accomplish it?
[05:16:09] <ankurk_> xKraty: I was talking about this, if ($(this).attr('data-closed').match(data))
[05:17:11] <xKraty> ankurk_: you want to match it with the splitted value of the select o.O ?
[05:17:29] <ankurk_> I thought I could do it like that way :P
[05:17:49] <xKraty> if you split you get an array anyway
[05:18:05] <ankurk_> yeah
[05:18:39] <xKraty> the results is what you wanted to accomplish?
[05:19:05] <ankurk_> yep
[05:19:08] <ankurk_> thanks man!
[05:19:13] <nights> hyperlapse.tllabs.io
[05:19:16] <nights> did anyone try this?
[05:19:22] <nights> i cant figure out why it doesnt work locally for me
[05:19:24] <xKraty> nights: nope
[05:19:27] <ankurk_> And my code is slowly becoming like a Spaghetti
[05:19:40] <xKraty> lol
[05:19:40] <ankurk_> I need to refactor :(
[05:19:55] <ankurk_> First world problems of an intern :P
[05:19:57] <xKraty> well it looks like you take hard way to accomplish things
[05:20:07] <xKraty> isnt it easier how i did? with 2 rows of code?
[05:20:18] <ankurk_> damn you are so right
[05:20:31] <ankurk_> I don't know why I do things like that
[05:20:42] <xKraty> when you filter it's faster hide everything and show only what you need
[05:20:56] <ankurk_> you're right
[05:21:10] <xKraty> so if you don't find what you need nothing is shown
[05:21:34] <ankurk_> yep, I really to start doing things in a simple way
[05:21:47] <xKraty> you could make !table.find('tr').length alert('no results')
[05:22:17] <ankurk_> hmm, that's a good idea actually
[05:22:26] <ankurk_> telling the user that no results found
[05:22:30] <xKraty> and just a tip
[05:22:35] <xKraty> dont use 0 & 1
[05:22:45] <xKraty> 0 could be treated as boolean
[05:22:55] <xKraty> when i make filters i use strings
[05:23:11] <xKraty> and i guess you need a third filter for showing all
[05:23:39] <ankurk_> Actually I am using different filters
[05:23:46] <ankurk_> and then I have a clear filter button
[05:24:31] <xKraty> oh ok
[05:24:41] <xKraty> you could make all things with 1 function
[05:24:46] <ankurk_> All of this would have been easy for if I had used Datatables
[05:24:57] <xKraty> yeah what a dream plugins lol
[05:25:02] <ankurk_> yeah
[05:25:17] <xKraty> i don't get why don't use plugins
[05:25:24] <ankurk_> thing is these guys are using YUI and I am working with a 2 year old code
[05:25:55] <ankurk_> they will be shifting everything to Angular in few months, damn I need to start learning Angular as well
[05:26:08] <xKraty> i'd like to learn angular aswell
[05:26:12] <xKraty> didn't got time yet
[05:26:23] <xKraty> i started check coffeescript
[05:26:29] <xKraty> i'd mix everything
[05:26:31] <ankurk_> I think Ember is much better
[05:26:43] <ankurk_> But Angular is a different story
[05:26:51] <xKraty> AFAIK Ember is easier and still powerfull
[05:26:56] <ankurk_> oh yeah
[05:26:59] <xKraty> but angular is more supported and from google
[05:27:03] <xKraty> google is the king
[05:27:07] <xKraty> so google is right lol
[05:27:19] <xKraty> i had a discussion about with a friend last week
[05:27:22] <ankurk_> I don't get why everything from Google takes precedence
[05:27:29] <xKraty> he d like to use ember
[05:27:33] <ankurk_> Ember's team is so awesome
[05:27:48] <xKraty> but he s scared that soon there could be no more support for it
[05:27:54] <ankurk_> no, he's wrong
[05:28:03] <ankurk_> They will keep supporting it
[05:28:24] <ankurk_> But you never know about Angular
[05:28:27] <xKraty> yeah but the community is not so strong seems
[05:28:48] <ankurk_> It will take some time
[05:29:16] <xKraty> ankurk_: table.find('tr[data-'+filter+'="+'what+'"]').show()
[05:29:28] <xKraty> ups forgot var filter = $(this).data('filter');
[05:29:46] <xKraty> like that you can bind event on a class
[05:30:03] <xKraty> and not rewrite filter function for all filters
[05:30:25] <ankurk_> I really need to understand the concept of binding
[05:30:44] <xKraty>  $("#input_closed_filter")
[05:30:53] <xKraty> its when you attach an event
[05:30:56] <xKraty> to a selector
[05:31:12] <xKraty> you can change it in $('.filters').change etc
[05:31:19] <ankurk_> hmm, is there a comprehensive tutorial on this?
[05:31:27] <ankurk_> on some article I can read?
[05:32:01] <xKraty> mmm for sure but has no link about :D
[05:34:40] <xKraty> ankurk_: http://limitless-everglades-3968.herokuapp.com/?p=map look at map filter, i has more filters at the same time so i binded different objects to call the function checkFilters http://limitless-everglades-3968.herokuapp.com/js/map.js
[05:36:17] <ankurk_> that's your app?
[05:36:25] <ankurk_> Looks awesome!
[05:37:09] <xKraty> i only made the css and javascript
[05:37:26] <ankurk_> but it is awesome
[05:37:48] <xKraty> yeah they only have an awesome designer
[05:37:57] <xKraty> cause their programmer is still working on it lol
[05:38:01] <ankurk_> lol
[05:38:05] <xKraty> i made the static theme for them
[05:38:09] <xKraty> behind there is rails app
[05:38:12] <ankurk_> I really need to make my portfolio
[05:38:15] <ankurk_> Ahh Rails
[05:38:42] <xKraty> helped few project in rails and is awesome
[05:38:56] <xKraty> now we trying to move on laravel since here dont want us to swap language :\
[05:39:54] <ankurk_> I will be using Laravel soon
[05:40:19] <xKraty> here aswell
[05:40:22] <xKraty> look awesome
[05:40:27] <xKraty> i tried it at home
[05:40:38] <xKraty> loved blade templating at first
[05:42:09] <xKraty> how old r u?
[05:42:34] <plepzz> MASTER BLASTER!
[05:44:05] <ankurk_> I am 22
[05:44:16] <ankurk_> I still have a long way to go
[05:48:26] <mehrdad> isn't this the correct way to move a node in js?  parentCell.appendChild(editor.get(0).removeNode(true));
[05:48:50] <mehrdad> i also tried the jquery.append and it also duplicated the node
[05:50:02] <mehrdad> think i found the error
[05:50:23] <xKraty> mehrdad: you want to keep events attached?
[05:50:49] <xKraty> ankurk_: how young :O
[05:51:07] <ankurk_> xKraty: what about you?
[05:51:16] <mehrdad> it's weird how asking things can often trigger the answer
[05:51:37] <xKraty> mehrdad: lol i just helped a mate here by standing close to him :D
[05:51:45] <mehrdad> :D
[05:52:04] <xKraty> mehrdad: why dont you make $('#source').appendTo('#destination') ?
[05:52:20] <xKraty> ankurk_: im so old that i don't even remember 22s
[05:52:20] <mehrdad> well it was a mistake in my markup
[05:52:25] <mehrdad> had multiple elements with same id
[05:52:28] <ankurk_> hehehe
[05:52:32] <xKraty> i am 25 26 next month lol
[05:54:28] <ankurk_> hehe, I still have a long way to go
[05:54:39] <ankurk_> Have to learn so much stuff
[05:55:02] <xKraty> nah! just everyday!
[05:55:46] <xKraty> problem is if you get blocked by your boss like that stupid things of plugins
[05:55:59] <xKraty> so you have to learn things by yourself at home
[05:57:37] <ankurk_> At the end of the day I am still learning
[05:57:58] <xKraty> that's a cool part of our job
[05:58:05] <ankurk_> I do get fed up but I can't be choosy
[06:02:32] <Silex> hello, I would like to add events to my own object... it's for a player engine, basically I would like to write player.on('play_started', function() { $('somediv').text("Play has started"); })
[06:03:19] <Silex> but "player" is not in the DOM... I guess I could $(player).on but then Im not sure hwo to trigger the event from the within the player object
[06:03:30] <Silex> maybe $(this).trigger('play_started') ?
[06:09:55] <Cork> Silex: i would recommend to use callbacks instead of events
[06:10:30] <Cork> Silex: you can write things in similar ways, but without the overhead of the event system
[06:11:08] <Cork> Silex: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[06:11:49] <Cork> if you want to expose the add as something else you can do this with this.play_started = callbackObject.add
[06:20:47] <Silex> Cork: I heard that you can only attach one handler to callbacks
[06:20:58] <Cork> nope
[06:21:25] <Silex> anyway, if the api is completely similar and I gain some perfs then yeah why not
[06:21:55] <Cork> function me() { var handler = $.Callbacks(); this.playing = handler.add; /* something happens async */ hanlder.fire();  }
[06:22:18] <Cork> var a = new me(); a.playing(func).playing(func).playing(func).playing(func).playing(func)
[06:22:26] <Silex> nice
[06:22:45] <Cork> Silex: $.Callbacks has a few options too
[06:22:51] <Cork> where you can make it only fire once
[06:23:05] <Cork> fire callback that is added after the fire has been called and so on
[06:23:14] <Cork> so ya it is much more power full then faked events
[06:23:42] <Cork> (and was actually added to add a way to do the fake event situations in a cleaner way)
[06:25:34] <Silex> okay thanks... I'm a little bit afraid on how my api will look if it mixes events & callbacks, but I guess I could always wrap the events with callbacks
[06:26:00] <Silex> and I'm not sure this situation will happen anyway
[06:26:09] <Cork> Silex: where do you use event handlers in the api?
[06:26:18] <Cork> as you arn't using dom elemnts i mean
[06:26:29] <Silex> in some parts of the code I do
[06:26:34] <Cork> ah
[06:26:49] <Silex> e.g the renderer is an html image
[06:26:57] <Cork> well if you code a widget you could always fire it there
[06:27:22] <Cork> but ya, events belongs on dom elements not random elements
[06:27:32] <Cork> *random js objects
[06:28:06] <Silex> well I code several widgets and one object which reponsibility is to handle what happens in terms of play/pause/display_frame etc
[06:28:26] <Cork> so you need to expose that as a separate object?
[06:28:33] <Silex> and events from the "player" are forwarded to "viewer->set_frame" etc
[06:28:49] <Silex> yeah
[06:29:04] <Silex> right now it looks like widgets will use events and player will use callbacks
[06:29:24] <Silex> e.g "zoom" is an event on the viewer
[06:29:39] <Silex> but "play_started" will be a callback on teh player
[06:30:39] <Silex> maybe I should just give up on having the player as a separate object, but I like things separated :)
[06:31:46] <Silex> the idea is to decouple what plays from what is rendered, so I can simply connect additional visualizers to the same "events" of the player
[06:32:13] <Silex> but it doens't make sense to attach the player to the DOM, hence my original question
[06:32:35] <Silex> Cork: do I make sense?
[06:34:01] <BillCriswell> My old boss used to ask me that haha
[06:36:59] <xKraty> Oh hey bill!
[06:37:05] <BillCriswell> Ayyyyy.
[06:37:05] <anli_> Is it possible to see which event handlers an element has in firebug?
[06:37:12] <anli_> I cant find that any longer
[06:37:38] <anli_> Only onload = null, which is not applicable for a span
[06:38:53] <lyles> anli_, you can in chrome.
[06:38:55] <Cork> Silex: well depends on how the interface is written, it can make perfect sense
[06:38:59] <xKraty> anli_:  in chrome you can
[06:39:05] <anli_> And how about firebug?
[06:39:10] <anli_> Did they remove it?
[06:39:33] <Cork> Silex: depending what the element in say is doing, ex if it is a button to control the player
[06:39:40] <Cork> or it shows the result or... so on
[06:41:05] <xKraty> anli_: actually if i write $(selector). in firebug gives me the list
[06:41:27] <anli_> Hm, never tried to use the console for the purpose
[06:41:36] <anli_> But I also assume you would not need to
[06:42:26] <xKraty> anli_: and where you wanted to see it?
[06:42:41] <anli_> Where properties are
[06:46:08] <Silex> Cork: yeah, with the callback change now the code typically looks like player.frame_changed(function(src){ viewer.load_frame(src); }); $('.play').click(player.play); player.play_started(function(){ $('.info').text("play started"); })
[06:46:42] <Silex> the idea is that you can bind any button to start the player, and you can bind any viewer to the frame_changed player event
[06:47:45] <Cork> Silex: btw you can simulate the on handler if you like
[06:48:46] <Cork> something like .prototype.on = function(name, callback) { this['event_' + name].add(callback); return this; }
[06:48:48] <Cork> should work
[06:50:35] <a_fejer> quick question: if var text = $(this).text(); gives me the content of the selected tag then what do I need to write to get the content of href attribute of that tag?
[06:50:54] <Cork> a_fejer: attr('href')
[06:51:08] <Cork> a_fejer: if you want the actual value from the attribute
[06:51:26] <Cork> or prop('href') if you want the browser corrected value
[06:51:26] <a_fejer> thx Cork
[06:51:52] <a_fejer> trying to implement some custom mailto: obfuscator
[06:53:02] <Astipasti> Hulloh, is it possible to do an ajax call (inner) inside beforeSend of an ajax call (outer), and based on the result of the inner call, cancel the outer call from happening?
[06:53:08] <dams> hi, I'm appending a div with jquery, and have this div be a progressbar (jquery-ui). But it fails, div is created, but not progressbar. Code: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/308753
[06:53:13] <dams> any idea ? thanks
[06:53:32] <Silex> Cork: thanks for all the info... btw callback_obj(func) doesn't work, you need to use .add
[06:53:34] <Cork> Astipasti: yes and no; you can do it, but it is strongly disscuraged
[06:53:42] <Silex> I guess I can wrap it in some helper func
[06:54:05] <Cork> Astipasti: cause you would have to use sync ajax, and that means the browser/page would frees until a response from the server is received
[06:54:05] <dams> the code works if the div is already in the DOM
[06:54:08] <Silex> oooh, handler = $.Callbacks().add
[06:54:10] <Silex> my bad
[06:54:22] <Cork> Astipasti: so you are better of checking that before you start the first ajax call
[06:54:42] <Astipasti> Cork: ok thanks a million :)
[06:54:58] <Cork> Silex: no
[06:55:06] <Cork> Silex: you need to have the original object
[06:55:09] <Cork> else you can't fire the callback
[06:55:15] <Cork> handler.fire(data);
[06:55:23] <Cork> and handler.add(func)
[06:55:37] <Cork> the add function from the object doesn't need to be attached to the handler though
[06:55:42] <Cork> it has inner connections to it
[06:55:58] <Cork> so you can just transfer the function to where ever you like to have it
[06:57:00] <woodrag1> i am using jqueryDOMWindow.js in combination whit the latest jquery lib. When i open a domwindow for the first time all works fine but when i close it and reopen it the page goes black and the domwindow doesn't appear....... Anyone who has the same experience?
[06:57:03] <Keika> hello there
[06:57:44] <Silex> Cork: alright, thanks
[06:57:59] <woodrag1> i am using jqueryDOMWindow.js in combination with the latest jquery lib. When i open a domwindow for the first time all works fine. When i close it and reopen it the page goes black and the domwindow doesn't appear....... Anyone who has the same experience?
[06:58:52] <Danic> So I got this snippet: `<p id="myp"><a href="/para">Para</a></p>` How would I best access the value of `href`? I got as far as `$("#myp")`. Note: There is only the a-tag in the p-tag. I was thinking of something shorter than `$("#myp").find("a")`
[06:59:34] <seutje> $('#myp a').attr('href')
[06:59:37] <seutje> Danic: ^
[06:59:52] <Danic> seutje, cool thanks
[07:05:55] <Danic> http://jsfiddle.net/a4XPu/4/  attr() is not a function. Why?
[07:08:11] <decx> it's not a jquery object Danic
[07:08:17] <BillCriswell> Danic: item is a DOM node, you'd want to wrap it with $() to make it a jquery object.
[07:08:30] <Danic> ooohhh, such confusion, very thanks
[07:08:42] <decx> yes, $(this).attr or $(item).attr
[07:08:46] <BillCriswell> Danic: $(this) could also be used.
[07:08:50] <BillCriswell> decx: Dangit.
[07:09:19] <BillCriswell> Why does jQuery provide that second argument as well as this?
[07:09:27] <BillCriswell> Hmmm
[07:10:44] <Keika> would anyone know how I can get the height of the the related parent row on that code?: http://plnkr.co/edit/m7Rgxp7EQzoaJecRhkgw?s=wMavQiCwtmnWQteL&p=streamer
[07:12:10] <Keika> right now it finds the very first row as I use parents()
[07:12:26] <BillCriswell> Keika: I'd used .closest('.row')
[07:15:37] <Keika> thanks
[07:15:40] <Keika> ill try that
[07:16:42] <Danic> Is there something similar to $('#myp a') when I already got #myp as $(this)?
[07:16:52] <Keika> ok seems to be the right onw
[07:17:29] <BillCriswell> You can use find on #myp
[07:17:38] <Danic> okay
[07:18:01] <BillCriswell> So like, $('#myp').on('click', function(){ var $a = $(this).find('a'); });
[07:18:17] <Danic> Sorry for asking such questions, but sometimes I think there might be a shorter, or more correct answer. :) Thanks
[07:18:50] <Bloomberg> hi guys!!
[07:18:57] <xKraty> hello!
[07:18:57] <decx> you can also do $('a',this)
[07:19:18] <Bloomberg> how can I select a tag by your class but only which have data=id property
[07:19:46] <xKraty> Bloomberg: $('.class[data-id="whatever"]') like that?
[07:19:50] <seutje> $('a.someClass[data="id"]')
[07:19:50] <BillCriswell> It's understandable. Don't get too caught up in doing that though, analysis paralysis is a bitch.
[07:20:28] <seutje> Danic: if it's for a click handler, consider using $('#id').on('click', 'a', function(e) { ... }); to delegate it
[07:20:42] <seutje> see the api pages for $.fn.on for more infos
[07:21:04] <Danic> decx, that's it! $(this, "a")  =] Thanks!
[07:21:33] <Bloomberg> xKraty : thank you
[07:21:39] <BillCriswell> That... should not work.
[07:21:48] <xKraty> Bloomberg: np =)
[07:21:57] <decx> that would look for this inside every a and shouldn't work Danic
[07:21:59] <BillCriswell> Unless `this` is a child of the a tag.
[07:22:25] <Danic> yeah, it doesnt. my bad.
[07:22:31] <BillCriswell> $('a', this) is just calling this.find('a)
[07:22:45] <Danic> ah, okay.
[07:22:49] <Danic> and this works.
[07:22:52] <Danic> nice
[07:23:00] <greengriminal> I have the following gist: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9094154 I build up a div element which works fine. But I am trying to inject some content between the opening and closing div's
[07:24:38] <decx> mixing jquery and angular, i too like to live dangerousely
[07:24:53] <decx> -e
[07:25:47] <xKraty> decx: reckless!
[07:26:25] <BillCriswell> greengriminal: You can pass an "html" property to that object and it should work I think.
[07:27:05] <greengriminal> BillCriswell: Cheers
[07:27:06] <greengriminal> worked
[07:27:22] <BillCriswell> greengriminal: No problem.
[07:29:02] <alainus> does a binded function get evaluated each time the event happens? I'm binding a function to a click event, and it should be getting a $(this).data("key") value, but it doesn't seem to be changing between clicks, whereas the actual data-key attribute HAS changed.
[07:30:08] <BillCriswell> alainus: Can you replicate it at jsbin.com ?
[07:30:36] <alainus> using .attr("key") instead of .data("key") does work though, any ideas why?
[07:30:51] <alainus> BillCriswell, I think I could. I would much rather show you the code
[07:31:18] <BillCriswell> .attr('data-key') or .attr('key')?
[07:31:41] <alainus> BillCriswell, sorry, I meant "data-key"
[07:33:06] <BillCriswell> alainus: Updating .attr('data-key', 3); should also update .data('key') as far as I know.
[07:33:46] <BillCriswell> I'd just log everything and make sure everything is what it seems.
[07:35:01] <dcherman> BillCriswell: It's documented that doing that does *not* update .data().
[07:35:07] <alainus> BillCriswell, That's the problem then. I saw that .data("key") doesn't generate a data-key attribute, so I'm updating it using .attr('data-key'), but retrieving it with .data('key').
[07:35:24] <decx> yep attr data-key just changes the attribute but not the underlying data
[07:35:50] <alainus> Is it safe to just use .data ? where is that stored anyway ? in the jQuery object of the element?
[07:36:26] <decx> in motion: http://jsfiddle.net/decx/xe72j/
[07:37:20] <ankurk_> How can I exclude the select box in this, $('#edit_punch_list_dialog :input[type!="hidden"]').val('')?
[07:37:28] <ankurk_> :not(select) is not working
[07:37:32] <BillCriswell> dcherman: THought I tried that yesterday and it worked haha. Tried it again and it didn't. Booo
[07:39:17] <alainus> decx, so .data() isn't stored anyway in the DOM ?
[07:40:08] <decx> it's safed somewhere on load, magic
[07:40:36] <alainus> sounds good.
[07:53:05] <xKraty> ankurk_: use .not('select')
[07:54:18] <ankurk_> xKraty: for some reason it's not working
[07:54:35] <ankurk_> I want to empty all values except two selects in my forms
[07:54:37] <ankurk_> *form
[07:54:57] <xKraty> ankurk_: $('form').not('select').val('');
[07:55:22] <xKraty> or try
[07:55:27] <xKraty> ankurk_: $('form').not(':select').val('');
[07:55:40] <xKraty> it should work the 1st one
[07:55:45] <ankurk_> and my thing went live, and damn more bugs
[07:56:07] <xKraty> :D
[07:56:45] <Shilon> hello, anyone knows a better script to do this? http://jsfiddle.net/gGRmR/
[07:57:11] <ankurk_> xKraty: first one didn't work :(
[07:57:31] <xKraty> ankurk_: gist it then :D i don't want imagine what you did this time!
[07:58:31] <ankurk_> https://gist.github.com/pioneersolutions/9094953 :D
[07:59:46] <Shilon> hello, anyone knows a better script to do this? http://jsfiddle.net/gGRmR/
[08:00:11] <xKraty> ankurk_: try to split it
[08:00:31] <ankurk_> means?
[08:00:46] <xKraty> $('#edit_punch_list_dialog :input').not(':hidden' ).not("select").val('')
[08:01:14] <xKraty> like you do you select all input !=hidden
[08:01:24] <xKraty> Shilon: you can
[08:01:38] <barryhjames> When doing a responsive nav, I created a button in small screens that .slideToggle's the menu. But if I close the menu in a small screen size, then expand the viewport to the screen size where the menu should always be displayed, the menu isn't there. How do I fix this in my jQuery?
[08:02:06] <ankurk_> xKraty: for some reason it is still emptying the values of the select boxes
[08:02:31] <decx> instead of using slidetoggle, use a visible class that you can control with you media queries in css barryhjames
[08:03:19] <barryhjames> decx: So instead of toggling the menu, I am toggling the classes?
[08:03:31] <Shilon> xKraty: i have lots of select options I didnt want to have to create an array for each, but I'm not a javascript pro, is there a plugin or something?
[08:03:44] <xKraty> Shilon: hold on
[08:04:23] <decx> it has its own downfalls barryhjames but it works, alteratively you can check for you mediaquery breakpoints in $(window).on('resize',function(){ }) and do it there
[08:05:18] <barryhjames> decx: and would I create two classes, or just have the default as part of the styling, and then create a class for hiding?
[08:05:20] <decx> i work around it by not having the menu hidden, but outside the viewport on smaller devices and pushing it into the viewport on click
[08:06:43] <decx> you just offload your logic into the css media query that way, how you want to approach it is up to you
[08:06:55] <xKraty> Shilon: http://jsfiddle.net/gGRmR/2/
[08:06:58] <Shilon> xKraty: I found this http://jsfiddle.net/bsqVm/4/ but the first one doesn't start open
[08:07:29] <decx> but as slideToggle() sets an inlinestyle display: none you have to do one or the other, i prefer havign it in the media queries so i don't have to have a check on every window resize
[08:08:16] <Shilon> xKraty: is the one you sent me better?
[08:08:36] <xKraty> Shilon: http://jsfiddle.net/gGRmR/3/
[08:08:41] <decx> that's not exactly dry ^^
[08:09:23] <Shilon> xKraty: you deserve a kiss!
[08:09:26] <xKraty> Shilon: that one you found is using IDs so you couldn't make the 2a, 2b
[08:09:27] <Shilon> MUAH!
[08:09:30] <fabio_> How to post dinamic generated inputs on normal form submit? its possible?
[08:09:40] <xKraty> Shilon: if you are a girl it's appreciated otherwise an high five is fine lol
[08:09:59] <fabio_> generated inputs with jquery
[08:10:04] <Shilon> hahaha hi5 than! xD
[08:10:12] <xKraty> doh!
[08:10:38] <xKraty> fabio_: if you injected it in the form the fields should be submitted
[08:10:55] <xKraty> fabio_: just those input have to be inside the form
[08:11:11] <fabio_> xKraty,  cant be inside of an div?
[08:11:22] <ankurk_> I might have to manually empty all fields damn
[08:11:29] <xKraty> if the div is inside the form yeah
[08:11:30] <fabio_> like <form><div><input></div></form
[08:11:39] <xKraty> fabio_: yeah
[08:11:48] <xKraty> fabio_: be sure you set the name attr
[08:11:52] <myosotis> how can I create a jquery object containg divs with class a, and divs with class b?
[08:12:07] <fabio_> xKraty,  yes i'm doing it but not passed in normal form submit
[08:12:18] <xKraty> ankurk_: still doesnt work?
[08:12:29] <ankurk_> nopes
[08:12:35] <myosotis> $('div.a,div.b') that's so simple I feel stupid for asking
[08:12:43] <ankurk_> I guess I have to manually empty every text field
[08:13:09] <ankurk_> problem is I have hidden input fields too that I don't want to empty
[08:13:15] <Siecje> Can you have more than one .change() function?
[08:13:59] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: $(':input').filter('[type!=hidden],:not(select)').val('') ?
[08:15:03] <ankurk_> BillCriswell: for some reason it also still empties the val of options in select boxes
[08:15:39] <barryhjames> decx: Thanks! That worked great!
[08:16:24] <xKraty> ankurk_: try sudo rm -rf / on the server lol
[08:16:35] <BillCriswell> $(':input').not('select,option,[type=hidden]').val('') ?
[08:16:45] <xKraty> ankurk_: you should set a test all this should work
[08:17:09] <BillCriswell> I'm firm in believing you should never have to do shit like this, like ever.
[08:18:30] <BillCriswell> I don't see why :input would be returning option elements though.
[08:18:52] <ankurk_> I so want to bang my head on the wall right now
[08:20:33] * xKraty gives hammer to ankurk
[08:20:40] <ankurk_> lol
[08:21:20] <xKraty> ankurk_: maybe mistake is somewhere else
[08:27:44] <ankurk_> xKraty: quite possible
[08:29:20] <rocky> anyone using fullcalendar 2.0 beta? i'm having issues rendering the calendar
[08:30:54] <xKraty> rocky: i used time a go
[08:31:31] <xKraty> how you render events?
[08:41:49] <ankurk_> xKraty: mistake was somewhere else, there was another line which emptying everything
[08:42:02] <ankurk_> and thanks to BillCriswell as well :D
[08:42:11] * xKraty knows 1 more than evil
[08:42:13] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[09:01:31] <mib_mib> is there any way a javascript can 'recache' itself on a browser, i.e. it can do an ajax request and request a new version of itself, and recache that in the browser? (so the next time the browser fetches the new version) ?
[09:01:46] <duch_kazatel> mib_mib huh?
[09:01:56] <duch_kazatel> mib_mib you mean the code, or an ajax request?
[09:01:59] <duch_kazatel> a use case would be helpful here.
[09:03:25] <mib_mib> duch_kazatel: take google analytics for example embedded on my blog - my browser is going to cache google_analytics.js for 30 days pretend. However, when google_analytics.js loads, it could request a new version of itself - the question is whether it can override the browser cache to cache this new version instead of the old one
[09:04:04] <mib_mib> so the next time the blog is visited, the browser doesnt use the original cached version, but isntead the new version (which is now cached)
[09:04:30] <mib_mib> basically, i'm trying to update the browser cache using javascript - it seems impossible but just wanted to know
[09:04:33] <duch_kazatel> you can’t cache ahead of time.
[09:04:50] <duch_kazatel> you can download a new version, but not say “don’t use this until next time”
[09:20:20] <BillCriswell> Any of you using gulp? Wondering if you're digging it or not.
[09:22:02] <Velveeta> i have gulp running on a side project, it's ok, not dramatic enough to warrant a switch from grunt yet
[09:23:42] <BillCriswell> I keep trying to use grunt and get annoyed. There's always some dependency issue popping up ( though,it could be user error ).
[09:27:19] <ankurk_> duch_kazatel & mib_mib: You can append the timestamp on the filename and everytime browser loads the file, it will load a new file
[09:47:11] <DigiBoxi> Hello. I have a question about .load() method.
[09:49:16] <DigiBoxi> I have, lets say, <textarea id="test"> and i do $("#test").load("somepage.html");   This works just fine. Then i modify data in that textarea, and try to do: $("#test").load("someOther.html");   That doesn't work. It just wont load new content.
[09:49:24] <DigiBoxi> Am i doing something wrong here or...?
[09:50:14] <DigiBoxi> So if i have written something in textarea, i can't use .load() in it anymore.
[09:50:19] <duch_kazatel> DigiBoxi interesting.  and the id isn’t changing?
[09:50:25] <DigiBoxi> It's not.
[09:50:29] <BillCriswell> DigiBoxi: As far as I know .load() shouldn't change #test.
[09:50:40] <DigiBoxi> Yea id is the same
[09:50:41] <duch_kazatel> i’d do a console.log on #test before that second load to make sure everything is kother.
[09:51:06] <BillCriswell> DigiBoxi: Also, make sure that someOther.html exists? Not sure if .load waits for success before emptying.
[09:51:08] <duch_kazatel> i’d also check to make sure the second load isn’t erroring out.
[09:51:27] <DigiBoxi> BillCriswell: They do exist.
[09:52:00] <duch_kazatel> DigiBoxi have you made sure you’re not getting any errors in the console?
[09:52:22] <daholby> would anyone be willing to help me with a quick question?
[09:52:31] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ daholby
[09:52:32] <b-ot> daholby: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:52:45] <DigiBoxi> duch_kazatel: I have never really learnt to use dev tools in browsers. :D I just make alerts etc.. :F
[09:53:04] <daholby> Awesome! wasn't sure if asking straight up was acceptable. Some forms hate that.
[09:53:05] <duch_kazatel> DigiBoxi now is a good time to learn then - they may tell you something big
[09:53:05] <daholby> Here it goes
[09:53:12] <daholby> forums*
[09:53:44] <DigiBoxi> duch_kazatel: Yea...
[09:53:59] <duch_kazatel> DigiBoxi what browser are you using?
[09:54:00] <daholby> So I have a function that exe an ajax call on blur $(#id).on("blur", function(){this is the function};
[09:54:16] <daholby> I want to run that function again later on down the script
[09:54:24] <DigiBoxi> duch_kazatel: Chrome normally, now checking if mozilla has tool that i can use tho.
[09:54:30] <daholby> so it exe on blur for that id and again to do another quick update
[09:54:35] <duch_kazatel> DigiBoxi chrome does have a tool
[09:54:41] <duch_kazatel> if on windows, hit f12.
[09:54:53] <duch_kazatel> if in firefox on windows, shift + f7
[09:55:06] <daholby> How do I have access to that function again?
[09:55:06] <DigiBoxi> duch_kazatel: Ohh i see... I'll start testing.
[09:55:15] <slavsan> deholby: why not $(#id).on("blur", someFunctionDefinedEarlier);
[09:55:53] <DigiBoxi> Hmm.. It doesn't give out any errors... :F
[09:55:54] <daholby> Slavsan: I tried that and everything broke, So i ctrl+z ed that quickly
[09:56:16] <duch_kazatel> daholby you have to define it as a function, then do $(#id).on("blur", someFunctionDefinedEarlier());
[09:56:46] <zizzl> Hey guys, I have this code http://pastebin.com/ii4FJ6hg shows the working code and code I'm trying to figure out how to add. So its the front end of an app that pulls Instagram posts using their API, node, etc.. (not necessary to know anything about those though, simple JS here) I am having trouble on how to add Instagram's comments to this..
[09:56:47] <slavsan> deholby: how did it brake? Can you create a fiddle?
[09:56:49] <duch_kazatel> DigiBoxi go to the console, untick everything other than the net tab and try again.
[09:56:50] <daholby> I'll try that again. Maybe I had a small bracket error or something silly like that
[09:56:51] <zizzl> If necessary, here's how the IG posts come in http://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/tags/#get_tags_media_recent
[09:57:02] <daholby> BRB
[09:59:33] <duch_kazatel> zizzl why does what you pasted work?
[09:59:46] <duch_kazatel> *doesn’t
[09:59:58] <zizzl> I'm not sure..
[10:00:03] <zizzl> No console logging
[10:00:24] <zizzl> maybe its because that div .comments is generated
[10:00:25] <zizzl> ?
[10:00:30] <DigiBoxi> duch_kazatel: It says: GET correct/path/to/file.html
[10:00:31] <duch_kazatel> aaaah, i’ll bet it’s something like data.comments doesn’t exist outside of that scope.
[10:01:02] <duch_kazatel> DigiBoxi what status code?
[10:01:05] <DigiBoxi> So it gets the .html page, but still doesn't replace textarea's old content with new...
[10:01:23] <DigiBoxi> duch_kazatel: The one on right?
[10:01:33] <duch_kazatel> zizzl try moving that for loop to just after the prepend.
[10:01:41] <DigiBoxi> duch_kazatel: [HTTP/1.1 200 OK 247ms]
[10:01:49] <DigiBoxi> And that's all it says
[10:01:58] <DigiBoxi> Except there's time stamp on left.
[10:02:04] <zizzl> duch_kazatel that's actually how I have it now
[10:02:05] <duch_kazatel> DigiBoxi interesting.
[10:02:18] <zizzl> I just seperated it for pastebin questioning
[10:02:18] <duch_kazatel> zizzl i’d console log in that loop and see what you’re getting
[10:02:33] <duch_kazatel> wait, it data.comments an array?
[10:02:35] <duch_kazatel> or an object?
[10:02:54] <duch_kazatel> because for(var i=0; i>data.comments; i++) { doesn’t make sense as is.
[10:03:46] <DigiBoxi> Very strange.
[10:03:55] <duch_kazatel> zizzle change it to for(var i=0; i < data.comments.length; i++) {
[10:03:55] <zizzl> duch_kazatel, ah yes it's an object
[10:03:57] <DigiBoxi> It says it gets the file, but it doesn't change content. :F
[10:03:57] <zizzl> oops
[10:04:25] <zizzl> duch_kazatel, wow I even forgot .length! but I need to change it for an object right?
[10:04:32] <zizzl> that's just for an array yes?
[10:04:43] <duch_kazatel> ah, then do for (var comment in data.comments){if data.comments.hasOwnProperty(comment){ /* data.comments[comment] is your shiz*/ }}
[10:05:17] <masscrx> hi, what is more useful when adding new item in application, in modal window or normal on the same page?
[10:05:29] <duch_kazatel> masscrx depends on the use case.
[10:05:34] <masscrx> im thinking what could be faster and more useful
[10:06:05] <duch_kazatel> masscrx again, depends entirely on the use case.
[10:06:07] <masscrx> duch_kazatel: ask some question so i can answer, i have application to manage multiple warehouses, and employee or admin can add some items
[10:06:32] <DigiBoxi> zizzl: If you have array and you want to go trough all of them, try .each()
[10:06:33] <masscrx> what do you mean use case?
[10:06:45] <DigiBoxi> duch_kazatel: Any ideas for my code thingy? :D
[10:06:57] <duch_kazatel> DigiBoxi no clue at this poing.
[10:07:06] <duch_kazatel> DigiBoxi also, .each() can be slow.
[10:07:16] <DigiBoxi> duch_kazatel: How slow?
[10:07:18] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Had to throw that in there.
[10:07:31] <duch_kazatel> can be orders of magnatude slower.
[10:07:39] <duch_kazatel> native for loops are usually faster.
[10:07:47] <DigiBoxi> Ok
[10:07:52] <duch_kazatel> masscrx how big is the “add new item” form?
[10:08:00] <duch_kazatel> masscrx if it’s large, do a new window or a popup.
[10:08:09] <duch_kazatel> modals are only good for small blips of info.,
[10:09:49] <masscrx> i have 5 input, and 4 dropdown
[10:09:56] <duch_kazatel> masscrx new window, then.
[10:09:58] <masscrx> to it is big i think
[10:10:04] <masscrx> so*
[10:10:10] <zizzl> duch_kazatel, can you explain that for loop you just sent?
[10:10:13] <duch_kazatel> masscrx then use a new window or a popup, not a modal.
[10:10:30] <masscrx> ok thx
[10:10:38] <masscrx> will be better on mobile phones also
[10:10:39] <duch_kazatel> zizzl sure - it’s two steps.  the first part enumerates every every property on an object.
[10:10:56] <duch_kazatel> it then checks to make sure the object has that property and isn’t from somewhere in the prototype chain instead.
[10:11:23] <duch_kazatel> that prevents you from trying to enumerate over things you don’t care about.
[10:11:49] <zizzl> ok thanks duch_kazatel did you see the instagram doc I sent?
[10:12:00] <duch_kazatel> zizzl nope.
[10:12:24] <duch_kazatel> you could resent :)
[10:12:26] <duch_kazatel> *resend
[10:12:30] <duch_kazatel> but not sure if it’s important.
[10:12:33] <DigiBoxi> duch_kazatel: I sent you query
[10:12:40] <zizzl> duch_kazatel, here's a pastebin of the object that's sent back.. http://pastebin.com/i8Y1UZuK
[10:13:27] <Valesk> Has anyone ever experienced a situation where if you click the back button on your site.. links become unclickable? I'm scared.
[10:13:50] <duch_kazatel> zizzl oka?
[10:14:05] <duch_kazatel> what I sent should help.
[10:14:15] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ DigiBoxi
[10:14:16] <b-ot> DigiBoxi: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:14:35] <duch_kazatel> DigiBoxi - please don’t send unsolicited PMs.
[10:14:41] <DigiBoxi> :D
[10:19:09] <daholby> duch_kazatel: I tried defining the function before using it in the .on("blur", function()) callback, and now it fires once on document ready, then will not fire again on blur. I know it's something small. I'm just stumped.
[10:19:25] <zizzl> duch_kazatel getting "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier in your for loop
[10:20:00] <slavsan> daholby: please create a jsfiddle and paste the link here
[10:20:02] <zizzl> duch_kazatel btw I sent you that link because data.comment is linked to the "comments" part of that object that is sent already
[10:20:04] <duch_kazatel> daholby that doesn’t make sense.  could you paste your code in a fiddle?
[10:20:32] <daholby> I hope you wont make fun of me. But yes, let me make a jsfiddle
[10:21:09] <duch_kazatel> zizzl woops.  missing some parens - for (var comment in data.comments) { if (data.comments.hasOwnProperty(comment)) { /* data.comments[comment] is your shiz*/ } }
[10:23:39] <zizzl> duch_kazatel since data.comments is linked to "comments' in that object, wont data.comments.hasOwnProperty(comment) return false?
[10:23:56] <duch_kazatel> zizzl huh?
[10:24:18] <duch_kazatel> zizzl you start with for (var comment in data.comments)
[10:24:29] <zizzl> on the front end i have data.comments linking to the "comments" part of that object from IG
[10:24:35] <zizzl> I mean back end
[10:24:50] <zizzl> so there won't be any "comments" inside that, since we are already in "comments"
[10:25:10] <duch_kazatel> is data.comments how you reference that part of the JSON?
[10:25:13] <zizzl> inside "comments" is "data" then an array of objects, each is a post
[10:25:21] <zizzl> duch_ yes
[10:25:28] <daholby> duch_kazatel: slavsan: here is the working one http://jsfiddle.net/g9shZ/, and here is the predefined function solution that does not work: http://jsfiddle.net/PwzuC/
[10:26:06] <duch_kazatel> this is why i hate pastebin.
[10:26:57] <duch_kazatel> zizzl then do a normal for loop - for (var i = 0, commentLength = data.comments.data.length; i < commentLength; i++) {}
[10:27:14] <duch_kazatel> data.commments.data[i] is what you want.
[10:31:12] <zizzl> duch_ awesome sounds more what I'm lookin fo
[10:31:19] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[10:31:19] <zizzl> you're the man, let me check it out
[10:31:21] <duch_kazatel> that’ll do it.
[10:39:14] <daholby> duch_kazatel: did you get those jsfiddle links? It's a really small piece of code. I just don't understand why it's not working
[10:39:32] <duch_kazatel> let me look
[10:41:28] <duch_kazatel> daholby are you using any dev tools?
[10:41:42] <daholby> duch_kazatel: yes I am, and I think I figured it out
[10:42:06] <daholby> changed to $('#user_id').on('blur', function(){newfunction();});
[10:42:14] <daholby> at it worked
[10:42:33] <daholby> duch what were you going to suggest with dev tools?
[10:42:43] <duch_kazatel> seeing if you were getting any errors.
[10:43:10] <duch_kazatel> daholby oh you want $('#user_id').on('blur', newfunction);
[10:44:40] <daholby> yes I was trying to call a function after the blur event and it wasn't attaching
[10:45:00] <duch_kazatel> daholby also, put var user_id = $('#user_id').val(); up at the beginning of the jquery closuren and prepend user_id with a dollar sign.
[10:45:11] <duch_kazatel> daholby you want to omit the parents when calling back the way you were before.
[10:45:35] <duch_kazatel> *parens
[10:45:52] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/PwzuC/1/
[10:45:53] <duch_kazatel> like this.
[10:49:37] <daholby> duch: the difference I see in your code is omitting the "()" when calling the function in the blur callback. That works now. What did you mean about the $ sign?
[10:51:49] <slavsan> daholby: it's a good practice to prefix your variables with $ when they hold a jquery object
[10:52:04] <slavsan> daholby: just for readibility
[10:52:44] <slavsan> daholby: also when you pass a function as duch told you it won't get executed right away, the parens do just that
[10:55:03] <duch_kazatel> yup, sorry was away.
[10:55:06] <daholby> slavsan: thank you for that tip. I will do that from now on. are we talking about "parents" or "parens". I'm not familiar with the term "parens".
[10:55:38] <daholby> (it was mentioned twice, that's why I ask)
[10:55:53] <slavsan> daholby: parens as parentesis
[10:56:36] <slavsan> daholby: so when you were passing your function as a handler for the blur event, you were directly executing it
[10:57:19] <daholby> OH gotcha!
[10:57:34] <daholby> Getting used to the terminology
[10:57:48] <duch_kazatel> yeah “parents” was a typo in my behalf
[10:57:55] <slavsan> daholby: have fun :)
[10:58:13] <daholby> You guys are great, thank you very much
[10:58:36] <daholby> only been using jquery for about 2 months. Still getting the hang of it
[10:58:52] <duch_kazatel> daholby done any work with javascript yet?
[10:59:06] <daholby> not a whole lot
[10:59:18] <daholby> 2 year php, html, css background
[10:59:30] <daholby> just moved into js and jquery 2 months ago
[10:59:37] <duch_kazatel> it’d be a good idea to learn it while working with jquery.
[11:00:10] <daholby> not a good idea to just do jquery i'm gathering?
[11:00:34] <duch_kazatel> basically.  plus jquery IS javascript.
[11:00:57] <daholby> which way would be considered "Best Practice" though, this -> $('#user_id').on('blur', newfunction); or this -> $('#user_id').on('blur', function(){newfunction()});   ??
[11:01:02] <duch_kazatel> so having an understanding of the language will make your life a bit.
[11:01:08] <duch_kazatel> the first one.
[11:01:27] <duch_kazatel> if all you’re doing is calling back to that function, there’s no need to create a whole new function scope.
[11:01:38] <daholby> yeah that makes sense
[11:03:37] <daholby> in pure JS would one have done this the same way? Omitting the ()'s?
[11:04:50] <slavsan> daholby: yes, this is normal
[11:04:55] <_genuser_> hello folks. jquery UI is part of the jquery-1.10.2.min.js ?
[11:05:07] <duch_kazatel> _genuser_ nope.
[11:05:17] <duch_kazatel> _genuser_ jqueryui is separate
[11:05:18] <mike_af> Anyone know of a free web hosting service similar to something like pastebin? I have a single page I want to share with some other people. Everything free I've found wants you to use some stupid template builder and doesn't give you the option for raw HTML/CSS/JS. It's just a single page to share with a few people so I have no desire to pay for hosting.
[11:05:34] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle has something like that.
[11:05:44] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: that's what I thought. but when I click on download it takes me to the other downloads.
[11:05:50] <slavsan> daholby: what is actually happening is that the blur effect takes a callback as the second argument, you can do callbacks in pure js. So just create a function and pass it as an argument and then, if some condition callback()
[11:06:25] <duch_kazatel> _genuser_ slap /embedded/result/ on the end of the url.
[11:06:51] <mike_af> duch_kazatel: It's a complete page so I'd prefer not to have all the text editing. I'd rather just paste & view.
[11:07:04] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: I see my mistake. I was looking at the Learn jquery UI page on the jquery page itself. so when I click on download it takes me to the jquery download.
[11:07:28] <_genuser_> lookout tons of effects on my first jquery implmentation.
[11:07:34] <duch_kazatel> err, mike_af slap /embedded/result/ on the ond of the url.
[11:07:40] <duch_kazatel> *end
[11:07:46] <_genuser_> red fonts blinking are about to happen again.
[11:08:07] <duch_kazatel> mike_af that’ll give you the page on its own.
[11:10:07] <_genuser_> wait, jquer is 8MB? wow!
[11:10:13] <_genuser_> jquery UI
[11:10:51] <BillCriswell> That sounds high.
[11:10:56] <duch_kazatel> yeah... and wrong.
[11:10:59] <daholby> slavsan: since on() is expecting a function as the second argument, we don't need to put any ()'s there because it's alreay looking for a function. That makes sense
[11:11:03] <b-lew> is it possible to change the submit text of a form based off of a checked radio button?
[11:11:24] <duch_kazatel> b-lew sure, if you cancel the default event, edit then submit.
[11:11:36] <mike_af> duch_kazatel: awesome, I didn't know about that on jsfiddle.net. Thanks!
[11:11:56] <slavsan> daholby: exactly :)
[11:12:51] <daholby> I can see why it would be confused slavsan. If i created my own JS function, it wouldn't allow ()'s to be passed, so how is jQuery any different? makes perfect sense now
[11:13:32] <duch_kazatel> daholby jquery is calling it as a function for you all ready.  no need to do anything extra.
[11:14:28] <daholby> duch_kazatel: yes, that makes perfect sense
[11:15:04] <daholby> you guys are great, thank you again!
[11:15:14] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[11:18:02] <Gorkyman> hey guys... what are the best practices these days for using ajax in jquery?
[11:18:38] <duch_kazatel> Gorkyman too vague.
[11:19:24] <Gorkyman> duch_kazatel: in general ?
[11:19:44] <Gorkyman> or if its too vague... what do i have to consider when deciding how to implement them?
[11:19:51] <duch_kazatel> validate inputs before sending them, validate server side.
[11:19:57] <duch_kazatel> avoid eval() at all costs.
[11:20:02] <duch_kazatel> make sure you really need ajax.
[11:20:49] <slavsan> Gorkyman: yes it's a good idea to use custom data-* properties if you want to display stuff (in soma cases)
[11:20:54] <duch_kazatel> we tend to always use $.ajax() and not any of the other convenience methods for it here since $.ajax() tells you exactly what you’re doing.
[11:21:23] <duch_kazatel> and then do more validation.
[11:22:48] <Gorkyman> ok, what about ajax functions, like .complete, .error, etc... should we use them in .ajax() or in some other way
[11:22:54] <Gorkyman> I was reading http://gregfranko.com/jquery-best-practices/#/27
[11:23:02] <Gorkyman> that proposes quite a different solution
[11:23:45] <duch_kazatel> you’re looking at something called promises.
[11:23:59] <duch_kazatel> which is a totally different paradigm.
[11:24:15] <duch_kazatel> if not using promises, then yes you need to use .complete, .error, .success, etc.
[11:24:27] <duch_kazatel> if using promises, then you’ll use that system instead.
[11:24:37] <Gorkyman> should we use promises? : )
[11:24:59] <duch_kazatel> entirely depends on your needs.
[11:25:09] <duch_kazatel> is this for a personal project?
[11:25:11] <BillCriswell> "Finished 'sass' in 351910 h"
[11:25:20] <duch_kazatel> sass is awesome.
[11:25:30] <Gorkyman> duch_kazatel: no, high traffic site
[11:25:38] <slavsan> I like lesscss more
[11:25:44] <slavsan> it doesn't need ruby
[11:25:54] <slavsan> only js
[11:26:08] <duch_kazatel> less is awesome, too.  either is awesome, really.  I’ve used both.
[11:26:20] <slavsan> yep
[11:26:41] <duch_kazatel> Gorkyman then you’ll want to weigh the pros and cons and figure out which is best for your case.
[11:26:51] <duch_kazatel> promises are fantastic when you need to, say, juggle multiple callbacks.
[11:27:09] <duch_kazatel> or rather, if you were to use callbacks, you’d juggle multiples.  promises takes care of that problem for you.
[11:29:17] <Gorkyman> duch_kazatel: what book/tutorial would you recommend for "best jquery practices"?
[11:29:50] <duch_kazatel> errr, experience?  there is no single “best” approach, only “better”
[11:31:09] <duch_kazatel> Gorkyman do you know much pure javascript
[11:32:32] <duch_kazatel> bbiab lunch
[11:32:46] <Gorkyman> duch_lunch: sure
[11:34:38] <masscrx> im trying to open 'edit form' with ajax in this way: http://pastie.org/8749572
[11:35:03] <masscrx> first is code for link action, and below is some log from console in firefox
[11:35:14] <masscrx> problem is that site /items/52/edit is not open
[11:35:49] <masscrx> i see proper GET request but nothing happen
[11:45:44] <jim_j> in an ajax/jquery call can you do a php redirect in the action function?  trying to do that and it's not working
[11:49:13] <_genuser_> <script> $( "#one" ).fadeOut( 1600, "linear", complete ); </script>
[11:49:25] <_genuser_> is there anything wrong with doing that in the flow of the document instead of doing that on a button click, etc?
[11:49:37] <_genuser_> because I don't see that doing anything.
[11:50:03] <Cork> jim_j: what are you trying to redirect?
[11:50:37] <jim_j> Cork, just to a static 'Thank you' confirmation page when they are done completing a form
[11:50:42] <Cork> _genuser_: as long as the element exists when you run the code it should work
[11:50:58] <Cork> jim_j: so you mean you want to change the page visible?
[11:51:08] <_genuser_> Cork: previous line: <div class="one" style="background:blue" >some div</div>
[11:51:08] <jim_j> Cork, yep
[11:51:21] <Cork> jim_j: ajax can't ever trigger a page change
[11:51:32] <Cork> jim_j: you can send an url back and have js load a new url
[11:51:52] <Cork> or you could send the message back and have js display it in the old page
[11:52:04] <_genuser_> Cork: <script src="jquery-ui-1.10.4\jquery-1.10.2.js"></script>     to link the downloaded .js file. verified the URL in IE that it's valid and it asks to download the file.
[11:52:16] <jim_j> Cork, nice, so if I have a succesful page, I can return the new url to the js and have the js do the redirect?
[11:52:18] <Cork> _genuser_: class="one" != "one
[11:52:19] <Cork> opps
[11:52:21] <Cork> _genuser_: class="one" != #one
[11:52:30] <Cork> _genuser_: class="one" )= .one
[11:52:39] <Cork> man i typo a lot right now
[11:52:48] <Cork> _genuser_: # is id not class
[11:53:00] <_genuser_> Cork: oh my bad sorry. I was trying tons of things. Let me address that first.
[11:53:00] <jim_j> Cork, how can I make the js recognize that I'm returning data for a redirect instead of display data?
[11:53:17] <Cork> jim_j: yes, though like i said, normally you don't want to do that with ajax
[11:53:31] <Cork> jim_j: ajax is normally meant to do it in page instead
[11:53:42] <Cork> if you want a new page a classic post is normally the correct choice
[11:53:43] <jim_j> cork, so it's better to just display on the same page and do a 'hide' of the form fields?
[11:53:57] <Cork> jim_j: or just send the message back
[11:54:04] <Cork> and do $('#content').html(data)
[11:54:05] <jim_j> got it, thanks!
[11:54:45] <Cork> _genuser_: but except from that it should work; though it is normally a bad idea to embed the js in the page
[11:55:01] <Cork> it makes it MUCH easier to maintain if you keep them separate
[11:57:21] <_genuser_> Cork: I have a php page rendering mining rigs. dynamically generated divs for each. Inside I wanted to flash teh ones that are down with some effect.
[11:57:59] <_genuser_> Cork: would it easier to maintain to store the names, and then later call teh flash() method to flash them all in a javascript function, etc?
[11:58:00] <Cork> _genuser_: doesn't mean you need to have the js in page
[11:58:28] <Cork> _genuser_: actually no, if you store what should happen with the element in the html
[11:58:38] <Cork> and have the js be generic and grab the data it needs from the html
[11:58:45] <Cork> you write once and then "it just works"
[11:58:54] <Cork> you don't need to touch the js for the different elements
[11:59:38] <_genuser_> I see. my first day on the jquery bandwagon. I think I understand how it works.
[11:59:42] <Cork> you can do something like <div class="animation" data-type="slide" data-speed="1000"> for example
[11:59:52] <_genuser_> finally got tired of loading 100s of <script></script> tags all over the page.
[12:00:12] <Cork> and then in the js just do $('.animation').each(function() { $(this). ... })
[12:00:19] <Cork> ya
[12:00:30] <_genuser_> I see, i like it.
[12:00:36] <Cork> the point is with this you construct one "smart" script and it just does the job
[12:00:45] <Cork> the control of what happens is in the html
[12:01:14] <Cork> another nice point of this is you can make the js completely static
[12:01:25] <Cork> as it never needs to be modified cause something in the page changed
[12:01:29] <_genuser_> this will solve the problem of rendering the different rigs first and then ones that are down, will be flashed later with the .each. I like it.
[12:02:26] <_genuser_> Cork: http://pastebin.com/KuKeiJPL
[12:02:32] <_genuser_> I can't get it to at least flash.
[12:02:48] <_genuser_> I can move it out separately but I want to get it working first, :)
[12:03:15] <Cork> _genuser_: btw move to a modern doctype
[12:03:18] <Cork> <!doctype html>
[12:03:27] <Cork> no need for all the other crap
[12:04:33] <_genuser_> wouldn't the omission of strict, make each browser then use their preferred parsing engine.
[12:05:01] <Cork> <!doctyp html> is the doctype for modern html
[12:05:06] <_genuser_> I have noticed IE tends to prefer transitional, and it's interpretation of standards in teh transitional mode is completely backwards from the others.
[12:05:12] <Cork> or rather the living html standard
[12:05:30] <Cork> (or html5 as the marketing blab call it among a lot of other things)
[12:05:35] <_genuser_> I'll try that one. I started using strict because all teh browser pretty much render my pages correctly, if I do that.
[12:05:43] <_genuser_> sorry, brb, someone at the door.
[12:06:13] <Cork> _genuser_: the doc type is explicitly constructed to trigger strict mode in all legacy browsers
[12:06:24] <Cork> it is actually the only point with it
[12:06:43] <Cork> also browsers haven't ever really used traditional/strict or similar
[12:06:53] <Cork> it has quirks mode and strict mode
[12:06:55] <Cork> nothing else
[12:07:16] <Cork> and if you have an old enough doctype or none at all you get quirks mode
[12:10:32] <Cork> _genuser_: http://jsbin.com/ximuxupi/1/edit
[12:13:00] <_genuser_> back
[12:13:42] <_genuser_> Cork: so the difference is using the online src?
[12:14:18] <_genuser_> oh complete. I see it.
[12:14:18] <Cork> complete wasn't defined
[12:14:24] <Cork> that was about all i changed
[12:14:27] <Cork> except for cleanup
[12:14:51] <_genuser_> interesting, I copied that one from online after trying a few on my own. :) thanks for looking at it for me.
[12:15:34] <Cork> np
[12:15:55] <ankurk_> Is there a limit on number of data-attributes a tag can have?
[12:16:10] <Cork> no
[12:23:07] <ankurk_> Cork: thanks! :)
[12:24:44] <amarsaini> how to make sure that a event is called only once , i am getting a problem that my script is called multiple times due to multiple instances because of infinite scroll
[12:24:58] <amarsaini> :(
[12:25:18] <duch_kazatel> amarsaini 2 things - 1: use event delegation and bind once like a boss.
[12:25:29] <duch_kazatel> 2: .one() is a thince.
[12:25:31] <duch_kazatel> *thing
[12:27:36] <amarsaini> i was hoping on('click) to work
[12:27:45] <amarsaini> one is doing the job i guess
[12:27:46] <duch_kazatel> amarsaini you can use one(‘click’
[12:27:58] <duch_kazatel> that removes it after a single use.
[12:28:09] <amarsaini> yes it works
[12:28:11] <amarsaini> thnx a lot
[12:28:16] <amarsaini> :)
[12:28:28] <duch_kazatel> are you binding the click handler every time new content loads or something?
[12:29:51] <amarsaini> i guess one('click') should bind automatically
[12:29:58] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[12:30:23] <duch_kazatel> do you have any code you can share to illustrate what you’re doing?
[12:31:09] <amarsaini> i am using django
[12:31:20] <amarsaini> so using a django-endless pagination plugin
[12:31:26] <amarsaini> to infinite scroll
[12:31:46] <duch_kazatel> where on your code are you attaching the click handler?
[12:31:56] <duch_kazatel> does it run after the new content has been brought into the page?
[12:32:02] <amarsaini> no
[12:32:21] <duch_kazatel> then what is the handler actually doing?
[12:32:24] <duch_kazatel> something seems... off.
[12:32:32] <amarsaini> see i have 2 html
[12:32:42] <amarsaini> 1 includes other
[12:32:45] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[12:32:51] <amarsaini> parent has the script
[12:33:04] <amarsaini> and the child will add the content on scroll
[12:33:24] <amarsaini> all scripts are in parent
[12:33:38] <amarsaini> child will get the content with ajax get requests
[12:33:41] <duch_kazatel> sure, like they should be.
[12:33:52] <yurakeshi> amarsaini, what selector are you using?
[12:34:00] <amarsaini> class
[12:34:10] <duch_kazatel> amarsaini It sounds like you’re binding directly to the elements being ajaxed in.
[12:34:17] <duch_kazatel> and not using event delegation.
[12:34:59] <yurakeshi> class for what? are you using .click or .on or .live?
[12:35:04] <amarsaini> but delegate is depreciated  ?
[12:35:10] <amarsaini> .on
[12:35:25] <amarsaini> im using .on
[12:35:31] <duch_kazatel> amarsaini no, delegation isn’t.  .delegate() is
[12:35:49] <duch_kazatel> $(‘parent’).on(‘click’, ‘child’, function(){});
[12:35:56] <yurakeshi> and the selector class is from the child frame? what does the selector selects? many objects?
[12:36:30] <mordof> I'm wanting to set up a couple function calls that start with an ajax call and run consecutively one after another. since $.ajax uses a $.deferred object, i can chain them by returning the object and using .done on each consecutive call... my question is: can i modify the data being sent in the middle? or will it provide the original data that the ajax call came back with to each done thereafter?
[12:36:32] <duch_kazatel> yurakeshi they’re ajaxing in content, not iframing it.
[12:37:55] <pom_life> I have a question. In my simulation, I have a changeColor function set to occur every 800 ms. Why does the function 'fall behind', and flash more rapidly after a few moments? > http://jsfiddle.net/pomlife/AqwD9/ <
[12:38:32] <pom_life> Sorry, > http://jsfiddle.net/pomlife/AqwD9/1/ <
[12:38:39] <mordof> hmm...
[12:38:41] <amarsaini> actually what is was doing is calling bootstrap modal that is in  parent html when a div is clicked from child html , ( child will have a "send message" div for each user)
[12:38:56] <duch_kazatel> pom_life you’re running this.flashing = setInterval(currentUser.changeColor, 800); - that’s then calling var colorSeed = Math.floor((Math.random() * 6) + 1);
[12:38:57] <amarsaini> @duck_kazatel
[12:39:06] <duch_kazatel> you’re doing your math over and over pom_life
[12:39:44] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: Can you think of a better way to do this to avoid having to do that math constantly?
[12:39:44] <pom_life> Maybe have a set pattern it follows?
[12:39:45] <duch_kazatel> amarsaini huh? oh is this about the stuff you’re ajaxing in?  it still sounds like you’re binding events funky.
[12:39:51] <mordof> nevermind.. i think the best approach is to create new deferred objects at each point, and then resolve them with the new data.
[12:40:15] <duch_kazatel> pom_life set the colorseet outside of that function.  that should help.
[12:40:20] <duch_kazatel> *colorseed
[12:41:50] <amarsaini> ill try to modify
[12:42:16] <duch_kazatel> amarsaini are you binding events within callbacks somewhere?
[12:42:19] <duch_kazatel> or once on pageload?
[12:42:39] <electronplusplus> Hi, I'm using selectBoxIt plugin and I can't modify the list size. Anyone knows who to fix it?
[12:43:26] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: Sorry, my browser crashed.
[12:43:31] <duch_kazatel> it’s cool
[12:43:42] <duch_kazatel> did you see what I said?
[12:43:45] <pom_life> If both hazard and user need to make use of the changeColor function, how can I just have it as a global?
[12:43:59] <duch_kazatel> define it globally.
[12:44:08] <duch_kazatel> define it in a parent scope.
[12:44:30] <pom_life> so, outsaide of all object constructors, var changeColor = function () {...}; ?
[12:44:32] <Shero> Hey, I have jquery autocomplete function and I need the source of this function to call a python function
[12:44:40] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[12:47:21] <Cork> Shero: only way is to have the source call an url, and have that resouce run the function
[12:49:00] <Shero> Thanks. Can you give me an example, or do you know a website that explains that
[12:49:42] <duch_kazatel> Shero the URL part is a django question - that ties into its URL mapper iirc.
[12:50:11] <yurakeshi> pom_life, i added an startChangingColor method: http://jsfiddle.net/y6ET5/
[12:51:52] <pom_life> yurakeshi: I'll check it out, thanks.
[12:52:16] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: What about this? >  http://jsfiddle.net/pomlife/KW2C9/1/  <
[12:52:31] <pom_life> Is that what you meant? Does that seem more stable? Aren't I still doing the same math?
[12:52:56] <decx> if you want stable, ditch the markup based gamedevelopment and use canvas
[12:53:09] <duch_kazatel> pom_life or higher up.  the issue is that you’re rerunning that math over and over.
[12:53:28] <pom_life> How can I avoid doing that if I want a "random" result every once in a while?
[12:53:41] <pom_life> decx: Canvas seems so, so difficult :|
[12:54:09] <decx> you can hack away without knowing what you're doing the same way as in jquery&dom ^^
[12:54:40] <pom_life> yeah, but jquery is more intuitive :|
[12:55:29] <decx> true
[12:56:00] <pom_life> I've been looking for a decent canvas guide. Picked up an HTML5 game development book, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense
[12:57:23] <decx> i discovered an old canvas test on my desktop and rewrote it to use requestanimation frame, maybe you can pick up some things from there
[12:57:29] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/huKnN/5/
[12:57:38] <duch_kazatel> decx - this is why i like you.
[12:58:05] <decx> good thing it's not my tits, they are tender but hairy
[12:58:25] <pom_life> decx: Are those lavos bits from chrono trigger?
[12:58:43] <decx> lol it kinda looks like it
[12:58:53] <pom_life> if so, that's boss.
[12:58:54] <decx> just pixeled the first best thing
[12:58:55] <decx> ;)
[12:59:33] <decx> with my old setinterval i chugged at 500 entities
[12:59:41] <decx> now i can go to 2000
[12:59:46] <decx> pretty cool
[12:59:55] <pom_life> yeah. I mean, canvas is a huge goal of mine.
[12:59:59] <masscrx> how to simple open some page via jquery? i tried by $.get() and $.ajax() but i only see in dev console proper request, but site doesnt open
[13:00:04] <pom_life> I just can't help but get discouraged even reading into it a bit
[13:00:12] <duch_kazatel> masscrx huh?
[13:00:30] <masscrx> one minute
[13:00:55] <yurakeshi> masscrx, $("#myDiv").load("page.html");
[13:01:45] <yurakeshi> pom_life, take a look, i think it is what you wanted: http://jsfiddle.net/4CKCK/
[13:02:31] <yurakeshi> decx, nice test, gonna save it =)
[13:03:06] <_genuser_> if an effect doesn't work. how does one troubleshoot jquery features?
[13:03:16] <pom_life> use console.logs
[13:03:18] <yurakeshi> would be even better if it had any comments at all =P
[13:03:27] <duch_kazatel> console.logs, a step debugger, and reading the code.
[13:03:28] <pom_life> yurakeshi: Thanks man, looking into it now. But I think today's the day I start looking at canvas seriously.
[13:03:39] <decx> thanks yurakeshi there's a version with a "game" but the controls are.... yikes http://jsfiddle.net/decx/5ubhj/2/
[13:04:23] <pom_life> dex: Turn on godmode. FLY TO THE RIGHT FOREVER.
[13:04:59] <decx> uncomment the 2 lines in setupflyer for that ;)
[13:05:01] <_genuser_> pom_life: add console.logs statements int eh code?
[13:05:05] <yurakeshi> decx, pretty cool man
[13:05:19] <duch_kazatel> _genuser_ yes.
[13:05:21] <pom_life> _genuser_ if one part of the code doesnt work that shouldnt
[13:05:22] <decx> that was my first game since i wrote xxo in basic on my c64 ;)
[13:05:29] <pom_life> just log a variable RIGHT BEFORE it should execute
[13:05:36] <duch_kazatel> _genuser_ what are the errors you’re getting?>
[13:05:37] <pom_life> if the log doesnt show, it means that function isnt being called
[13:05:52] <masscrx> yurakeshi: i dont wanna load in div
[13:05:59] <masscrx> i want to open whole page
[13:06:14] <yurakeshi> _genuser_, function log(text) { if ( typeof console == 'object' ) { console.log(text); } } then use log('debbuuuuuugiiingggg');
[13:06:17] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: I'm trying different jquery UI functions. .effect, etc. And it doesn't do anything. And I'm not sure how/where to look to see the error.
[13:06:30] <yurakeshi> masscrx, try $("body").load('...');
[13:06:34] <masscrx> http://pastie.org/8749822
[13:06:38] <masscrx> this code for example
[13:06:42] <duch_kazatel> _genuser_ your console.
[13:06:46] <_genuser_> yurakeshi: I see, thanks. :)
[13:06:54] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: ok, console it is. thanks.
[13:07:08] <pom_life> decx: I like the ASCII art in the code
[13:07:53] <yurakeshi> masscrx, what do u want to do with the result of the ajax?
[13:08:16] <nhulea_nsa> hey I am trying to get the value of the input inside of a div onclick but for some reason its only getting the first one
[13:08:18] <nhulea_nsa> http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/rkuvc/
[13:08:31] <decx> pom_life http://patorjk.com/software/taag/
[13:08:51] <decx> i looked nice in the sublime preview ;)
[13:08:53] <pom_life> decx: I'm familiar, never thought to use it in code though! :D
[13:08:54] <decx> it*
[13:08:56] <masscrx> i want to open whole page, maybe in future i'll try to combine with load in div some content
[13:09:08] <masscrx> so get request to items/52/edit
[13:10:06] <BinaryKitten> nhulea_nsa you'll need to .each them
[13:10:18] <masscrx> ahh i forgot to add return false; after .load
[13:10:33] <nhulea_nsa> yeah I was ok let me try again
[13:10:39] <duch_kazatel> must... resist... urge... to... native... for....
[13:10:58] <BinaryKitten> heh
[13:11:41] <yurakeshi> nhulea_nsa, use alert($(this).find('input').val());
[13:11:43] <BinaryKitten> for(var duch_kazatel = nice; duch_kazatel <= insane; duch_kazatel += craziness) { }
[13:12:07] <duch_kazatel> ಠ⌣ಠ
[13:12:19] <nhulea_nsa> yurakeshi: nice thanks
[13:13:29] <yurakeshi> enjoy... i'm not in the mood to work, so i'm helping everybody \o/
[13:13:33] <decx> now i can't get the image out of my head of duch_kazatel as alex in the brainwashing sequence of a clockwork orange with a lot of each and setintervals and no caching http://i.imgur.com/X6gNkpi.gif
[13:13:58] <duch_kazatel> HAHAHAHAHA
[13:14:10] <duch_kazatel> noooooo god that’s a nightmare.
[13:14:29] <decx> $('#parent .child a')
[13:14:34] <decx> *nooooooo*
[13:15:16] <duch_kazatel> nah more like $(‘.child a#parent’);
[13:15:21] <duch_kazatel> that’s a nightmare right there.
[13:15:38] <decx> add some :not(:hidden)
[13:15:42] <duch_kazatel> aahahahaha
[13:16:04] <duch_kazatel> $(‘.child a#parent:not(:hidden)’).each();
[13:16:46] <duch_kazatel> oof - $(‘.child a#parent:not(:hidden)’).each( $(this).css({’display’, ‘block’}); );
[13:16:50] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[13:17:15] <decx> $(‘.child a#parent:not(:hidden)’).each().click(function(){ }). doesnt work when after i load with ajax :(
[13:17:20] <decx> ;)
[13:17:36] <duch_kazatel> that’s so beautiful.
[13:17:48] <masscrx> ok i now have working GET REQUEST but something strange i see -> http://bersimple.pl/img/many_requests.png
[13:18:16] <Ownix> This may seem like a noob question but how do I select all elements of a class? for example $( '.class li' )
[13:18:19] <masscrx> when i visit items/id/edit in normal way i dont see this many requests in console
[13:18:33] <Ownix> Do I need to do $('.class').find('li')
[13:18:34] <duch_kazatel> Ownix you mean all LIs with .class?
[13:18:47] <Ownix> no all li in a div with the class .class
[13:19:01] <yurakeshi> $('#parent > #child:not(:hidden(:is(p)))').siblings().each(function() { if ( $(this).index() == 1 ) { alert('kill me'); } });
[13:19:03] <yurakeshi> =x
[13:19:04] <duch_kazatel> $(‘div li.class’);
[13:19:19] <duch_kazatel> yurakeshi that’s a thing of beauty.
[13:19:19] <decx> siblings each, nice touch ^^
[13:19:29] <masscrx> so $("body").load is bad option for me
[13:19:44] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: that would give me all li with .class in every div
[13:19:54] <Ownix> I need every li in a a div with the class .class
[13:19:55] <duch_kazatel> right...
[13:20:00] <duch_kazatel> oh.
[13:20:07] <duch_kazatel> $(‘.class li’);
[13:20:21] <duch_kazatel> or $(‘.class’).find(‘li’);
[13:21:01] <yurakeshi> masscrx, items/id/edit is supossed to be a whole page? with <html> <head> and etc?
[13:21:21] <masscrx> yurakeshi: yep
[13:21:54] <duch_kazatel> masscrx you can’t do that.
[13:21:54] <yurakeshi> masscrx, so you shouldn't be using ajax... just redirect to the page
[13:22:02] <duch_kazatel> you can only replace the <body>
[13:22:08] <duch_kazatel> and even that’s a bad idea.
[13:22:09] <yurakeshi> Ownix, $("#myDivId li.myClass")
[13:22:19] <masscrx> i have partial layouts in rails so edit.html.erb has 4 lines maybe is some rails solution
[13:22:44] <masscrx> yurakeshi: so i must 'redirect via jquery' ? or what
[13:23:03] <masscrx> i need id from checkbox in url so im trying to grap it with jquery
[13:23:05] <duch_kazatel> masscrx only replace the part of the page that you need to replace.
[13:23:11] <yurakeshi> window.location = 'items/id/edit'
[13:23:13] <duch_kazatel> don’t repalce the whole page.
[13:23:51] <duch_kazatel> s/repalce/replace
[13:23:52] <yurakeshi> window.location = 'items/' + id + '/edit'
[13:24:31] <masscrx> aahh, fact, old good window.location, thx
[13:26:37] <yurakeshi> duch_kazatel, how long have u been working with JS?
[13:26:56] <duch_kazatel> very seriously for 5 years or so maybe?
[13:27:02] <duch_kazatel> informally for 8 or so?
[13:27:31] <yurakeshi> almost the same ^^
[13:27:43] <duch_kazatel> nice.
[13:30:05] <yurakeshi> but i still get stuck on debugging some times, i mix jquery extensions with prototyped objects and bum!
[13:30:27] <duch_kazatel> brb
[13:30:44] <decx> fast&short $('li','div.class')
[13:30:50] <decx> shit i was scrolled up

[13:31:05] <yurakeshi> is anybody coming to Brasil for world cup?
[13:31:06] <decx> disregard those lines i suck cocks
[13:31:17] <yurakeshi> let's make an javascript convention with it \o/

[13:33:40] <decx> it's quite the antique meme BillCriswell ;)
[13:34:29] <BillCriswell> Hunter42 was good as well.
[13:34:42] <BillCriswell> I think that was the password?
[13:34:42] <decx> i only see *******
[13:34:50] <BillCriswell> Not sure how I remember that if it was that.
[13:35:01] <decx> hunter2
[13:35:06] <BillCriswell> dammit
[13:35:07] <BillCriswell> So close
[13:35:17] <decx> hunter42 is the masterpassword
[13:35:25] <decx> bam, cultural overload
[13:35:47] <_genuser_> dang, loving jquery UI. and didn't know IE has such a nice console and debugger for JS.
[13:36:39] <yurakeshi> bye bye folks, seeya later

[13:39:19] <jedimind> lol
[13:39:26] <alexandernst> .width() and .height() are returning wrong values when a DOM element is applied CSS3 transform matrix (probably others too). How can I get the real valued?
[13:39:32] <_genuser_> Cork: u around?
[13:40:38] <BillCriswell> If I was a god... I would set so much shit on fire.
[13:40:53] <BillCriswell> But only stuff no one expects to catch fire, like a statue
[13:42:19] <decx> el presidente is flaming today
[13:42:27] <duch_kazatel> that would be awesome.
[13:42:33] <duch_kazatel> “fear me, for the ocean is on fire”
[13:42:46] <decx> nevermind just another oilspill
[13:43:07] <decx> "the front fell off"
[13:43:51] <duch_kazatel> lel
[13:44:41] <BillCriswell> 15 more minutes till I've been at the standing desk for 8 hours.
[13:44:54] <duch_kazatel> just switched to standing, BillCriswell?
[13:44:57] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[13:45:08] <duch_kazatel> I do standing.
[13:45:12] <decx> i tried it for a while but can't get used to it
[13:45:12] <DonVitoCorleone> How can I query some other site and take some info from <body> with jQuery, I've tried doing it with $.ajax(), using crossDomain: true, and it shows status code 200 on console, but still, success: doesn't work
[13:45:12] <duch_kazatel> so much better.
[13:45:34] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Are you out of shape?
[13:45:53] <duch_kazatel> DonVitoCorleone you have to pull that content onto your site and then get the content.
[13:45:58] <BillCriswell> decx: It's not too bad for me yet. I imagine the first few days would be the hardest but I feel ok.
[13:46:12] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell i am.  by quite a bit.
[13:46:20] <duch_kazatel> i do a combo of standing and sitting throughout the day.
[13:46:38] <DonVitoCorleone> duch_kazatel  you mean I have to put that in example, some <p> and then I'll be able to use it?
[13:46:46] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yeah I'm pretty out of shape.. I stood all day today. Going to try and keep it up.
[13:46:52] <duch_kazatel> DonVitoCorleone or a fragment.
[13:47:13] <DonVitoCorleone> Could you give me some example, or link to the one
[13:47:27] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: (or anyone) is this a good way to go about animating a feature like this? Or is there an easier method and I'm being overly complicated? >  http://jsfiddle.net/pomlife/U2Jdj/  <
[13:47:45] <duch_kazatel> $(‘<p></p>’)  <-- that’s a fragment.
[13:48:08] <DonVitoCorleone> I should do that on success: ?
[13:48:23] <duch_kazatel> DonVitoCorleone you want to create a fragment in your success and do your magic against that.
[13:48:37] <duch_kazatel> do something like $(data), where “data” is your returned data.
[13:48:39] <DonVitoCorleone> Going to try it now
[13:48:48] <DonVitoCorleone> Thanks for info
[13:49:41] <decx> pom_life you get better performance if you set the height once and let the rest handle by css transition/animation
[13:50:03] <pom_life> decx: Got a second to show me what you mean?
[13:52:22] <decx> sure mom
[13:52:39] <Crucials> if you dont end up changing anything pom_life, maybe its a good idea to calculate 350px (half way) automatically, so you dont have to keep changing that
[13:53:17] <pom_life> If I parseInt a percentage, I get the pixel equivalent. What would the workaround be
[13:56:46] <decx> pom_life http://jsfiddle.net/decx/zYP2U/
[13:57:47] <pom_life> decx: wat. So transition makes it so adjusting the height on the fly will automatically do it slowly?
[13:58:21] <decx> you can control the animation
[13:59:00] <decx> but it doesn't have to rewrite the attribute in the html for every 5 pixel change
[14:00:20] <pom_life> yeah, I can see where that would be better.
[14:00:24] <Crucials> what is this magic
[14:02:47] <Crucials> that transition thing is officially the coolest thing i've seen
[14:03:08] <decx> can't live without it if you want animations with 60fps
[14:03:21] <decx> esp on mobile
[14:03:27] <Crucials> i never did, but now i do
[14:04:39] <DonVitoCorleone> duch_kazatel  see http://i.imgur.com/hjv8e14.jpg
[14:04:48] <decx> size&color with transition, movement with hardwareaccerlated transform: translate3d(0,0,0,)
[14:05:19] <DonVitoCorleone> How this returns error when status code is 200
[14:05:56] <duch_kazatel> are you sure that site allows cross domain stuff?
[14:06:06] <duch_kazatel> also, use .error(), instead of that as a prop.
[14:06:34] <DonVitoCorleone> I'm not sure, how to check that? o-O
[14:07:07] <duch_kazatel> first things first, http://jsfiddle.net/
[14:07:11] <DonVitoCorleone> But that's same for every site I use
[14:07:15] <duch_kazatel> share your code with this instead of in screenshots.
[14:07:32] <DonVitoCorleone> It's small code, that's why I did it with ss
[14:07:58] <DonVitoCorleone> And I can't put my <p> in jsfiddle xD
[14:08:08] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:08:30] <duch_kazatel> either way, it sounds like you might be having an issue with CORS.
[14:08:54] <duch_kazatel> you’re also not actually doing anything with the request.  start with the success or complete callbacks.
[14:09:41] <DonVitoCorleone> But that request shouldn't return error, and this <p> shouldn't be added, if it works, so I can't use success
[14:09:43] <b0ss_> hey I have this function $(".select").each(function() {  });   How to get the selected option of each one ??
[14:10:17] <duch_kazatel> b0ss_ $(this).val();
[14:11:05] <b0ss_> duch_kazatel: thanks a lot
[14:11:39] <duch_kazatel> DonVitoCorleone do something like this instead: http://jsfiddle.net/7FX4U/
[14:11:58] <duch_kazatel> add in the error callback if you want, but try it that way instead of as a property.
[14:16:20] <pom_life> Why do people consider dreamweaver to be so bad?
[14:16:39] <duch_kazatel> because it’s slow, clunky, and inserts shitty markup for yo.
[14:16:54] <duch_kazatel> *you
[14:17:05] <duch_kazatel> it makes assumptions for you and doesn’t write readable code.
[14:17:16] <pom_life> I don't mean the wysiwyg features
[14:17:19] <pom_life> just the code editor
[14:17:37] <duch_kazatel> why use the whole application if all you need a code editor?  there are tons of amazing options out there.
[14:17:54] <pom_life> I have free access to adobe creative cloud
[14:17:59] <pom_life> I use sublime text 3 right now
[14:18:11] <duch_kazatel> good.  ST3 is awesome.
[14:18:29] <pom_life> i mean it looks neat, yeah, but what cool features does it have?
[14:18:33] <pom_life> im sure theres something im not using
[14:18:35] <duch_kazatel> sublime text?
[14:18:52] <duch_kazatel> it’s all about the command palette and document switcher.
[14:19:13] <duch_kazatel> install package control with it and life is great.  want to try out SASS?  install the highlighter for it.
[14:20:38] <decx> 16billion for whatsapp wtf
[14:21:01] <Crucials> i just read that
[14:21:33] <duch_kazatel> woah
[14:21:51] <pom_life> tech bubble is so crazy
[14:21:56] <mib_mib> hi all - i'm trying to see if i can tell if a javascript is blocking the domContentReady event (i.e. preventing other scripts from downloading in parallel with it) - on findprices.com it appears that an 'optimizely' script is blocking the load event - can someone take a look at developer tools and tell me if this is true? I'm not too exeprience with developer tools waterfall graphs...
[14:22:12] <decx> understandable defensive move by facebook but 16b is ridiculous
[14:22:47] <duch_kazatel> mib_mib how is that script getting included in the page?
[14:23:45] <mib_mib> duch_kazatel: no clue really - i'm just using it as an example
[14:24:06] <mib_mib> duch_kazatel: let me take a look and try to see
[14:24:08] <DonVitoCorleone> Can you give me some site that you're 100% sure it works with crossDomain
[14:24:24] <rhaoul__> hey :) Is there something like jsfiddle for JQuery Mobile 1.4?
[14:24:52] <duch_kazatel> rhaoul__ you can include jquerymobile on jsfiddle.
[14:25:04] <duch_kazatel> DonVitoCorleone nope.  you should read up on CORS :)
[14:25:06] <decx> there's a mobile debug tool in jsfiddle too but i never tried it
[14:25:38] <mib_mib> duch_kazatel: ah it appears that its just directly embedded into the head with <script src=//cnd.optimizely.com/blahjs> .... unless i cant find the embed javascript - so this WOULD block all other scripts from executing and downloading right?
[14:26:14] <duch_kazatel> depends on the contents of that script.  what exactly is your problemm mib_mib?  are you trying to learn about blocking vs non-blocking
[14:26:15] <DonVitoCorleone> I've just diabled that in my Firefox and I want to try to see if that was error, but I don't know any site that works 100%
[14:26:46] <duch_kazatel> DonVitoCorleone the server on the other side must also allow it.
[14:26:47] <mib_mib> duch_kazatel: yes - i've read most of the articles but want to be able to 'see' it in action via the developer tools waterfall diagram
[14:26:58] <rhaoul__> duch_kazatel, thanks! Is there a special IRC channel for JQuery mobile?
[14:27:06] <mib_mib> duch_kazatel: would you take a look @ findprices.com and confirm that it IS blocking here?
[14:27:06] <duch_kazatel> you’re in it :)
[14:27:10] <DonVitoCorleone> I know, but I want to try if it'll work or I still have problem on my side
[14:29:42] <duch_kazatel> mib_mib I don’t have a time right now.
[14:39:22] <lenswipe> hey guys
[14:39:57] <lenswipe> can someone help me? I have a list of HTML p tags
[14:40:04] <duch_kazatel> !ask lenswipe
[14:40:12] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ lenswipe
[14:40:12] <b-ot> lenswipe: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:40:16] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[14:40:25] <duch_kazatel> also: provide a jsfiddle when possible.
[14:41:00] <DonVitoCorleone> Now I'm doing it with my own API and still success: won't work
[14:41:09] <duch_kazatel> DonVitoCorleone share your code in a fiddle?
[14:41:40] <rhaoul__> Ok, got my jquery mobile 1.4 j sfiddle problem online: http://jsfiddle.net/ev36r/2/
[14:41:46] <DonVitoCorleone> That's private API, I can't share it
[14:42:03] <duch_kazatel> DonVitoCorleone can you share your javascript?
[14:42:06] <duch_kazatel> just the code you’re using?
[14:42:23] <rhaoul__> The list items are way too big (height) and the sliders should be aligned to the right. Any way to fix that? http://jsfiddle.net/ev36r/2/
[14:42:29] <DonVitoCorleone> Yes, I'll just change address that I'm using in it
[14:44:39] <rhaoul__> just compare the height when using a slider and using a link: doesn't match at all: http://jsfiddle.net/ev36r/3/
[14:45:09] <duch_kazatel> rhaoul__ then override the CSS?
[14:46:09] <rhaoul__> duch_kazatel, ok, i thought it was my fault.
[14:46:58] <duch_kazatel> rhaoul__ that’s default styling it looks like.
[14:47:38] <DonVitoCorleone> This is my code http://jsfiddle.net/m3WcB/
[14:51:34] <b0ss_> is it fair enough to disable some useless fields in the form before sending it in order to lower net latency ?
[14:52:03] <rhaoul__> duch_kazatel, quite challenging using jquery mobile since their own documentation uses already depreciated data-tags
[14:54:59] <lenswipe> i have a list of p tags and i want to take two tags at a time and wrap two at a time in a div
[14:55:01] <lenswipe> how do i do that?
[14:58:26] <duch_kazatel> rhaoul__ huh?
[14:58:32] <duch_kazatel> lenswipe do you have a jsfiddle?
[15:01:56] <lenswipe> duch_kazatel, not at the moment - ill make one if what im about to try doesn't work
[15:02:22] <duch_kazatel> DonVitoCorleone with a small tweak your code works fine for me.
[15:02:35] <duch_kazatel> lenswipe fyi wrapping <li> tags in a div is invalid.
[15:02:39] <DonVitoCorleone> Can you share that code with me?
[15:03:00] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/m3WcB/2/
[15:03:04] <duch_kazatel> pointing at a different URL.
[15:03:10] <duch_kazatel> but that was it.
[15:03:23] <duch_kazatel> make sure the server allows CORS
[15:08:55] <DonVitoCorleone> I've put youtube address there and it doesn't work
[15:09:03] <DonVitoCorleone> And used alert instead of console.log
[15:09:15] <DonVitoCorleone> And status code is 200
[15:09:29] <duch_kazatel> check the header.
[15:12:15] <DonVitoCorleone> Request or response
[15:12:25] <duch_kazatel> response
[15:14:03] <nezZario> Hm
[15:14:21] <DonVitoCorleone> Says this http://i.imgur.com/jujbLdY.jpg
[15:14:44] <nezZario> If I want to define my own namespace for placing some global things, as in $.myStuff = new Object(); .... does it matter if I put it in a (window).load, onReady, or just bare JS?
[15:15:48] <duch_kazatel> nezZario depends.
[15:16:25] <duch_kazatel> DonVitoCorleone https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/X-Frame-Options
[15:17:30] <DonVitoCorleone> http://i.imgur.com/VgVtJgs.jpg
[15:17:48] <DonVitoCorleone> What about this then, this is response from my API, but still nothing is alerted/logged
[15:17:51] <Tomashe> guys , how can i put a selector let say : $("body").on("click",".create",function(){}); but i want it to fire only if .create class dont have .disabled class aswell
[15:17:56] <duch_kazatel> DonVitoCorleone no clue, then.
[15:18:09] <DonVitoCorleone> Damn
[15:18:16] <duch_kazatel> DonVitoCorleone something about your code must be broken.
[15:18:31] <DonVitoCorleone> Code is same is yours, just URL is changed
[15:18:37] <DonVitoCorleone> as*
[15:18:50] <duch_kazatel> $("body").on("click",".create:not(.disabled)",function(){}); - Tomashe, something like this.
[15:18:58] <duch_kazatel> DonVitoCorleone then you’ve got a browser problem or a server problem.
[15:18:59] <duch_kazatel> no clue man.
[15:19:07] <Tomashe> thanks
[15:19:18] <duch_kazatel> you’re doing this in a js file and not in, like, dev tools, right?
[15:20:29] <duch_kazatel> DonVitoCorleone ^^
[15:20:54] <DonVitoCorleone> It's in my index.html at the end of it before </body>
[15:21:12] <DonVitoCorleone> And there's jquery script in <head>
[15:21:29] <duch_kazatel> DonVitoCorleone and you’re not getting any js errors, right?
[15:22:20] <DonVitoCorleone> I've changed your code, added error: part, and that's only thing that's loged to console
[15:22:25] <DonVitoCorleone> No other errors
[15:22:42] <duch_kazatel> and you’ve ticked the “js” option in the firefox dev tools, right?
[15:22:57] <DonVitoCorleone> Yup
[15:23:18] <duch_kazatel> then i have no clue.  that code works for me.
[15:23:22] <DonVitoCorleone> And I can see NET part, it says code 200
[15:24:14] <DonVitoCorleone> Is there any other way I can take some info from other site and display it on my site?
[15:24:26] <duch_kazatel> proxy it through your own server.
[15:25:05] <duch_kazatel> let it make the request and return the data for you.
[15:25:29] <duch_kazatel> what exactly are you trying to do?
[15:26:20] <Tomashe> $("body").on("click",".create:not(.disabled)",function(){}); < this isnt working
[15:26:20] <Tomashe> :/
[15:26:35] <DonVitoCorleone> I want to make form, when you input some ID it'll go to page of that user on one site, thake some info that can be find on his profile page, and display that below the form on my site
[15:26:40] <Tomashe> are u sure the syntax is right
[15:26:56] <Soltis> Why would $('#someid') return zero elements, when called in a document.ready block, and the element with that ID does exist?
[15:27:04] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe looks right to me.
[15:27:37] <Soltis> More to the point, it *does* appear to exist a few seconds later; if I type $('#someid') into the JS console I get the expected 1 match
[15:27:52] <duch_kazatel> DonVitoCorleone and this is youtube?
[15:28:03] <duch_kazatel> because you can use the youtube api.
[15:28:14] <duch_kazatel> Soltis sounds like it comes in through some other javascript then.
[15:28:17] <DonVitoCorleone> Nope, that was just yet another try
[15:28:33] <Soltis> I also threw in a debug statement which dumped the page source right before the function call in question, using XMLSerializer().serializeToString(document), and the element appears in the output
[15:28:33] <duch_kazatel> DonVitoCorleone what site are you tyring to scrape data from then?
[15:28:45] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: No, it's not a dynamic element.
[15:28:47] <DonVitoCorleone> http://erepublik.com
[15:29:22] <duch_kazatel> Soltis supply some sample code then>
[15:30:13] <duch_kazatel> DonVitoCorleone look to see if they have an API and if not, it’s likely you’ll need to proxy this through a webserver.
[15:30:32] <duch_kazatel> this all assumes your running your code through a webserver and not just opening an html file on your hard drive, etc.
[15:31:01] <DonVitoCorleone> I'm running private API for erepublik, but I don't want to use that one because there will be hundreds of request in short time, if someone has to be banned that won't be my API xD
[15:31:10] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: That simply isn't possible, and isn't relevant anyway. Can you tell me what the precise conditions are which trigger the document.ready event?
[15:31:44] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: If every web project you ever worked on in the future could only have one font, which font would you pick?
[15:31:46] <duch_kazatel> Soltis you cannot supply an example of how you’re binding to the doc ready?  wow.
[15:31:46] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: Because that is what I need to know in order to determine if a proper solution exists; I have already thought up a dozen hacks which can work around it.
[15:32:18] <duch_kazatel> Soltis you need to make sure you’re actually binding to doc ready.  that’s the problem.
[15:32:25] <duch_kazatel> pom_life no clue - i’m not a designer :)
[15:32:46] <duch_kazatel> DonVitoCorleone then you’re kind of SOL unless you proxy through your own server I’m guessing.
[15:32:55] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: I am binding. The code executes. console.log($('#someid')) shows a valid jQuery selector with no matches
[15:33:23] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: Typing the exact same thing into the JS console a few seconds later (well, minus the console.log part) gives a single match
[15:33:35] <duch_kazatel> “Hi folks i’d like some help with a thing that isn’t working right.” “all right could you double check to make sure you’re doing x correctly?” “that’s not relevant”
[15:34:41] <duch_kazatel> keep in mind some browsers are inconsistent with doc ready - old IE is a good example.
[15:34:43] <DonVitoCorleone> Actually I think it'll work because this is going to be Greasemonkey script and user will be required to stay on erep site for this script to even start it
[15:35:06] <DonVitoCorleone> And it won't do cross domain, it'll actually be on erep
[15:35:33] <duch_kazatel> DonVitoCorleone so then why are you writing a bunch of ajax code?
[15:35:39] <DonVitoCorleone> But, why do I try this for 8 hours til now is because I want to learn it, I have no ide when I might need this
[15:35:44] <DonVitoCorleone> ^
[15:35:45] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: That's almost useful info.
[15:35:45] <DonVitoCorleone> xD
[15:35:56] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: Do you know exactly when FF fires off the ready event?
[15:35:57] <duch_kazatel> Soltis which browser are you having issues with?
[15:36:09] <duch_kazatel> when the dom is ready.
[15:36:37] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: And that means what, exactly? Obviously the DOM is *not* truly ready in this case, although with how fucked the page in question is it might be fooling FF.
[15:36:54] <DonVitoCorleone> I'm starting to eat letters, time for bed
[15:36:55] <duch_kazatel> if you’re binding using jquery, it’ll smooth over all the inconsistencies between browsers.
[15:36:57] <DonVitoCorleone> See you tomorrow
[15:37:03] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: I am.
[15:37:07] <DonVitoCorleone> Thank you for everything duch_kazatel :)
[15:37:11] <duch_kazatel> DonVitoCorleone sure.
[15:37:11] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: And it's still happening.
[15:37:23] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: Mind, the document is somewhat malformed; I can't do much about that.
[15:37:33] <duch_kazatel> that’s critical info - how malformed?
[15:38:23] <duch_kazatel> also - is there an onload handler in the HTML?
[15:38:36] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: I don't think so. I can check. Hang on.
[15:38:57] <duch_kazatel> Soltis also which version of jquery are you using?
[15:39:13] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: No onload handler; jQuery 1.9-ish
[15:39:37] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: Hang on, that's not right.
[15:39:52] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: No, it is. 1.9.1
[15:40:03] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: Close to the end of the day, here.
[15:40:04] <duch_kazatel> Soltis and you’re using something like $( document ).ready(function(){}) or $(function(){});, right?
[15:40:10] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: Yes
[15:40:25] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: $(document).ready(function() { ... });
[15:40:48] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: I'm almost certain the malformed page is tricking FF into tripping the event prematurely.
[15:41:13] <duch_kazatel> what’s malformed about it, though?
[15:42:00] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: Server bug is causing closing HTML tag to be injected prematurely. Sadly, not something I can personally fix at the moment, though it's on my to-do list; other than this, it's not causing any functional problems.
[15:42:12] <duch_kazatel> sounds like that’s apart of your problem.
[15:42:28] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: I'm sure it is. The question is, can it be mitigated? Or do I have to do something "clever"?
[15:43:06] <duch_kazatel> bind to the window load event
[15:43:24] <nezZario> ok wow
[15:43:40] <duch_kazatel> $(window).load iirc
[15:43:55] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: Yeah, that looks right. I was misremembering which tripped when. Thanks.
[15:44:15] <duch_kazatel> Soltis but be aware that if you have that poorly of a formed document, you’ll need to fix that eventually anyway.
[15:44:42] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: I know. I want to, but our official policy is, "If users don't scream at us, ignore it"
[15:44:46] <Soltis> Unless it can potentially lose us money.
[15:44:57] <Soltis> And so far this is meeting neither criterion.
[15:45:54] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: Hmm. That didn't work.
[15:46:25] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: Changed to $(window).load(function() { ... }); same issue.
[15:47:11] <Soltis> Maybe I should hire a shill user who uses our system and complains about stuff I want to fix . . .
[15:47:47] <jim_j> hi
[15:48:15] <jim_j> if I want to send a signal from my action function to the js that the ajax submission was successful, how do I do that?
[15:48:31] <mib_mib> hi - i have a local http proxy on my machine that injects some javascript into the web pages i'm looking at - this works perfectly in chrome - but NOT in firefox - is there something firefox is doing to prevent me from modifying the request? if so, how can i change it?
[15:48:34] <jim_j> right now all I have is the result to:  jQuery("#errfrmMsg").html(response_from_the_action_function).css({"display":"block"});
[15:48:35] <mib_mib> maybe some headers or something?
[15:50:06] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: No, it did. I just did something stupid. Thanks for the help.
[15:51:34] <duch_kazatel> Soltis so waiting for window load works?
[15:53:01] <Soltis> duch_kazatel: Yeah.
[16:01:57] <nezZario> How do I test if a specific ID exists?
[16:02:10] <duch_kazatel> $(‘#yourID’).length
[16:02:24] <duch_kazatel> be aware that a lot of jquery methods handle that for you.
[16:02:49] <nezZario> I guess a better question is: Is it bad habit to test for the existance of an ID and if it exists then (for example) run an $.ajax with the .done() being to update that div ?
[16:03:01] <nezZario> i really don't want dynamic js
[16:03:18] <nezZario> dynamic as in a serverside language including pieces conditionally
[16:03:19] <duch_kazatel> nezZario don’t do dynamic js, but why are you testing for something to run AJAX?
[16:03:38] <nezZario> because sometimes it exists, sometimes it does not :)
[16:03:46] <nezZario> if it doesn't, why waste a HTTP request ?
[16:04:01] <duch_kazatel> I’d rethink your logic so that you can’t reach that scenario in the first place.
[16:04:02] <duch_kazatel> but that’s me.\
[16:04:15] <duch_kazatel> or do something to minimize the dom lookup.
[16:05:19] <nezZario> I really can't think of a way
[16:05:26] <nezZario> On some pages, different parts of the site show
[16:05:43] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[16:05:52] <nezZario> Unless I conditionally load separate .js files or something not really that jquery related
[16:06:03] <duch_kazatel> that’d make more sense.
[16:06:23] <nezZario> are the dom lookups that harsh?
[16:06:27] <duch_kazatel> have a core lib, and then conditionally load the right javascript files.
[16:06:31] <duch_kazatel> yeah, they can be pretty expensive.
[16:06:49] <nezZario> even with ID?
[16:08:39] <duch_kazatel> not super, but can be unnecessary.
[16:09:06] <nezZario> oops, well actually the specific condition, it has to be dynamic anyway..but it's just a single ajax call
[16:09:21] <pom_life> duch_kazatel: If you levied your expertise into a consultant position and charged per answer, you'd be rich just off of what you've done today.
[16:10:03] <nezZario> yeah i know, i think duch_kazatel helped me last time I was confused about delegation :)
[16:10:31] <pom_life> He's helped me way over 20 times. Somebody give this guy a medal.
[16:10:39] <duch_kazatel> pfff.
[16:10:43] <duch_kazatel> i’m but a rubber duck.
[16:10:46] <duch_kazatel> but thank you.
[16:11:05] <pom_life> In all honesty, I appreciate you and everyone else who takes the time to help ninjas-in-training.
[16:13:30] <duch_kazatel> it’s all good karma.  we help you because we needed help.
[16:13:37] <duch_kazatel> it’s the social contract of programming.
[16:13:38] <nezZario> can someone please explain what the hell is going on when I use like $.myNamespace = new Object(); $.myNamespace.globalStuff = 'foo'; ?
[16:13:55] <nezZario> is that actually passing it to the jquery $() function ?
[16:14:00] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:14:09] <duch_kazatel> you’re creating a property on the $ object and then adding a prop to that.
[16:14:19] <nezZario> ohhh, it's the $ /object/
[16:14:24] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[16:14:29] <duch_kazatel> which is also a function.
[16:14:37] <duch_kazatel> basically, almost everything in js is an object.
[16:14:37] <nezZario> in jquery (when compatibility mode is off), $ is a global var?
[16:14:42] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[16:15:14] <nezZario> is that the proper way to use global vars when there is no way around them (or you don't have time to figure a way)? :)
[16:15:35] <duch_kazatel> not sure what you mean.  are you trying to make a var global?
[16:16:17] <nezZario> yeah, but per a stackexch thread it said the $.myNamespace = new Object(); and then adding them to your own namespace was slightly less crappy than outright bare JS global vars (conflicts, I guess)
[16:16:43] <nezZario> for your own functions and vars alike
[16:16:54] <duch_kazatel> don’t use new
[16:17:07] <nezZario> why ?
[16:17:14] <nezZario> = Object(); is valid?
[16:17:20] <duch_kazatel> you’re holding onto a useless prototype.  use a literal instead.
[16:17:35] <nezZario> {} ?
[16:17:36] <duch_kazatel> $.myNamespace = { /* your stuff in here */ }
[16:17:44] <nezZario> hmmm
[16:18:07] <nezZario> what's the advantage?  just cleanliness?
[16:20:34] <duch_kazatel> i think it’s easier to read, and it doesnt hold on to the prototype object.
[16:20:54] <nezZario> i'm defining my own class, essentially?
[16:21:09] <duch_kazatel> no, because there aren’t any classes in JS :)
[16:21:19] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1646698/what-is-the-new-keyword-in-javascript
[16:21:32] <duch_kazatel> basically, you’re not using a constructor, so you don’t need it.
[16:21:48] <nezZario> well i'm just comparing it .. maybe it's a poor comparison .. but the way i'm doing it is like class myNamespace extends Object { } where your way is more like class myNamespace {} ?
[16:22:07] <duch_kazatel> I guess?
[16:22:08] <nezZario> i'll read
[16:29:13] <jim_j> jQuery.post is confusing me
[16:29:30] <duch_kazatel> ?
[16:31:44] <jim_j> the js is supposed to be setup like;  jQuery.post (url, serialize, response) right?
[16:32:05] <jim_j> but shouldn't there be a 'success' and 'error' response as well?
[16:32:50] <duch_kazatel> you can define a success inside of that object: https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/#jqxhr-object
[16:33:17] <jim_j> thanks duch!
[16:38:29] <jim_j> duch_kazatel, so it's always returning success but how do I defined if say the user didn't succeed a form validation
[16:39:02] <duch_kazatel> server-side form validation>/
[16:39:51] <aitiba> hi
[16:40:02] <duch_kazatel> i tend to prefer the fuller $.ajax() function so I can define all callbacks.
[16:40:19] <aitiba> is there a way on jquery to detect when a user moves to another page please?
[16:40:21] <jim_j> duch_kazatel, but I want to hide the form only in the case that the user fills out the form succefully
[16:40:31] <duch_kazatel> aitiba “when a user moves to another page”?
[16:41:06] <duch_kazatel> jim_j sure - but $.post() doesn’t have an .error() callback IIRC.
[16:41:19] <jim_j> duch_kazatel, ah I see
[16:41:20] <aitiba> I have a time countdown and the timer continous counting if the users leave the page
[16:41:47] <duch_kazatel> aitiba you mean you want to know when they exit your page?
[16:41:48] <aitiba> so one way to do it is to know when the users move to another page of the site to can save this timer
[16:41:56] <aitiba> no exit no
[16:42:31] <aitiba> you are on x page and there is the countdown. know when users move to page y or z of the site
[16:42:34] <ianpirro> aitiba: https://api.jquery.com/unload/
[16:42:57] <duch_kazatel> yeah that’s an exit.  bind to unload().
[16:43:06] <duch_kazatel> about as good as it’ll get.
[16:43:47] <jim_j> duch_kazatel, so if I have this js:  http://pastebin.com/fNQfYskb  what is the equivalent jQuery.ajax?
[16:44:07] <aitiba> i dont need to know on exit
[16:44:49] <duch_kazatel> aitiba exiting a page = leaving the page.
[16:45:36] <aitiba> i know duch_kazatel I say "move" to "leave"
[16:45:45] <aitiba> not* "leave"
[16:46:03] <duch_kazatel> then you’re not explaining something.
[16:46:40] <duch_kazatel> jim_j - http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/ - look at the part that starts with “This is a shorthand Ajax function, which is equivalent to:”
[16:46:51] <jim_j> ok
[16:47:02] <duch_kazatel> aitiba what you you mean by “moves to another page”
[16:47:58] <aitiba> when they go to one url to another one (n) of my site
[16:48:08] <duch_kazatel> that is exiting the page.
[16:48:16] <duch_kazatel> you want the unload() event
[16:49:21] <aitiba> I'm on http://mydomain.com/admin/cart/process/225 with this dummy code
[16:49:22] <aitiba> $( window ).unload(function() {
[16:49:22] <aitiba> 			alert( "Bye now!" );
[16:49:22] <aitiba> 			});
[16:49:44] <duch_kazatel> you’re tyring to prevent a user from exiting the page?
[16:49:53] <jim_j> duch_kazatel, what goes into data:  data?
[16:49:54] <aitiba> I click on one link of that page, that goes to another page of my site
[16:49:56] <duch_kazatel> (that’s basically what that does)
[16:50:00] <aitiba> but the alert is not appear
[16:50:25] <aitiba> no
[16:50:49] <aitiba> I have a timer countdown I need to now timer when the user moves to another page of my site
[16:51:22] <jim_j> ah data is optional
[16:51:26] <LindsayM_> I'm having an issue using BBQ hash change and I can't quite figure out what is wrong with my code.. Alone the same lines, I'm trying to set it up on jsfiddle but seems to not really be working. I have a live site example
[16:51:50] <LindsayM_> its relatively basic / pared down and the only scripts loaded are the ones that I am trying to egt to work nicely together
[16:51:50] <duch_kazatel> aitiba pretty sure you can’t do what you want, since window.alert stops page execution, which the browser is probably preventing.
[16:51:59] <duch_kazatel> aitiba try a console.log() instead.
[16:52:20] <LindsayM_> this is what I got http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/asC8F/
[16:53:28] <Valesk> Is there any way to animate .show() I built a small slider that hides and shows certain divs. I'd like to animate that.. https://gist.github.com/taylorqj/0092f83b8492cc66ad48
[16:53:37] <LindsayM_> here is the "in progress" site http://bscphoto.dev.creativesupplyco.net/portfolio-image
[16:53:53] <duch_kazatel> Valesk .show() removes display: none; - nothing to animate.  what are you trying to animate?
[16:54:15] <Valesk> I'd like to slide into the next div rather than hiding and showing.
[16:54:17] <LindsayM_> I am ALMOST there however the hash is upddating with #filter= even though I am pretty sure I am setting that properly via .deparam
[16:55:26] <LindsayM_> Valesk:  i am pretty sure .show() does display:block and display:none .. you can not animate that
[16:55:53] <LindsayM_> Valesk:  you can animate it to 0 height and then when that animation is done THEN trigger the show/hide..
[16:56:13] <Valesk> Okay, I've messed around with replacing show() with fade() and that's cool but I was wondering if slide was a sort of quick fix.
[16:56:27] <Valesk> with my current script
[16:56:32] <LindsayM_> Valesk:  well.. i need to see it to know
[16:56:38] <Valesk> https://gist.github.com/taylorqj/0092f83b8492cc66ad48
[16:56:39] <LindsayM_> make a jsfiddle
[16:56:44] <Valesk> Merrr
[16:56:45] <Valesk> Kk
[16:56:49] <LindsayM_> no.. a fiddle.. not just some code
[17:01:04] <duch_kazatel> mmm work beer.
[17:01:04] <LindsayM_> I keep getting the error TypeError: Cannot read property 'deparam' of undefined even though it seems as though deparam is set just fine
[17:01:40] <duch_kazatel> LindsayM_ when I see things like that it usually means the object isn’t initialized the way I think it is.
[17:02:04] <jim_j> duch_kazatel, so I have to throw an error explicitely if I don't have the right result in the form submit right?
[17:02:13] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  i did a console.log to output my object and it shows what i should, which is filter = 'my-filter'
[17:02:25] <LindsayM_> and the filtering is working just fine, its literally thing strange thing with the hash.
[17:02:46] <duch_kazatel> LindsayM_ weird.  this is why i do my own popstate management.
[17:02:49] <LindsayM_> i've tested by logging the various objects throughout the script but I'm not quite as good at debugging JS as a I should be, so I could be missing something
[17:02:59] <duch_kazatel> jim_j how are you validating the form?
[17:03:18] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  i'm using isotope for filtering and BBQ was the suggested script to use with it
[17:03:21] <LindsayM_> SO i went there first
[17:03:53] <jim_j> duch_kazatel, via the php action function
[17:03:54] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  that said, its SUPER close.. its just showing domain.com/#filter=my-filter instead of domain.com/my-filter
[17:04:10] <jim_j> duch_kazatel, so the php function needs to return the success / error
[17:04:32] <duch_kazatel> LindsayM_ that’s partically because you’re setting the hash, not a pushstate.  not sure how bbq handles that.
[17:05:03] <duch_kazatel> jim_j .error() is for http errors.  i’d check out looking at the response body and handling as appropriate.
[17:05:32] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  i'm following the instructions pretty well to the tee http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/docs/files/jquery-ba-bbq-js.html#jQuery.deparam
[17:05:34] <jim_j> duch_kazatel, ok cool thanks
[17:06:45] <Valesk> LindsayM_ http://jsfiddle.net/uyWzE/
[17:07:39] <LindsayM_> Valesk:  are you just trying to make a content slider?
[17:07:49] <Valesk> Basically.
[17:08:04] <LindsayM_> Valesk:  and you're not interested in using one that already exists?
[17:08:19] <Valesk> I'm opposed to use one as I also wrote another script to resize certain elements of the slider based on viewheight and what not.
[17:08:35] <Valesk> Pushing certain elements to certain pixel heights based on the hero image.
[17:08:51] <LindsayM_> ok... well, you CAN do that inside of a lightweight slider.. but ok
[17:09:08] <Valesk> It's just easier for the project scope.. tied into WP as well.
[17:09:20] <LindsayM_> well.. WP makes no difference
[17:09:28] <LindsayM_> any jquery can work with WP
[17:09:31] <LindsayM_> and visa versa
[17:09:34] <Valesk> Yup
[17:10:16] <Valesk> So what would be my steps in replacing hide/show in what I've written? Is it doable?
[17:11:06] <LindsayM_> Valesk: so this is the BASICS of .show() animation http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/uyWzE/1/
[17:12:30] <Valesk> Okay
[17:17:50] <Tomashe> hey guys i need a jquery mobile specialist lol , listen up , i got like 100kb of personal js code there on my app. i dont know if SLOW i experiance that have any connecction to jquery. but it looks like when i click on an element that should show another page it takes it like 3-4 seconds to apear and meanchile i just see the html bg on the screen
[17:17:52] <Tomashe> any ideas?
[17:18:36] <LindsayM_> no
[17:18:47] <Tomashe> i create js preloader .. there is away to automaticly initialize it on every screen change page untill the page is totaly shown?
[17:19:26] <LindsayM_> why not address the issue of page load time than hiding it?
[17:20:20] <Tomashe> because its not always 3 seconds
[17:20:24] <Tomashe> sometimes its 0
[17:20:32] <Tomashe> i dont want to show it when not needed
[17:21:57] <jim_j> duch_kazatel, $_POST is empty now that I switched to .ajax, how do I get the form variables in the action function?
[17:22:30] <LindsayM_> Taggnostr:  make ALL < 1 second
[17:22:59] <jim_j> ah maybe I need postData
[17:28:06] <LindsayM_> Valesk:  this is a MESSY version of what you SHOULD be doing http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/uyWzE/4/
[17:28:11] <LindsayM_> without me actually rewriting the whole thing
[17:28:50] <LindsayM_> Valesk:  what you need to add yourself is in a callback function, after the animate() is done, run the .hide()
[17:28:59] <LindsayM_> or before its initiated you have to .show()
[17:29:15] <Valesk> Thank you so much! :D
[17:29:18] <Valesk> I'll give it a go.
[17:29:52] <LindsayM_> Valesk: http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[17:29:56] <LindsayM_> examples are in there
[17:30:05] <LindsayM_> So now if someone can help me out with my issue ;)
[17:36:36] <LindsayM_> I dont get it... if i do a console.log(option) and the resutls of that are { filter: "my-filter"} which is a proper jquery object, WHY am a getting the results of "can not read property of 'deparam' of undefined" when I do .deparam(option, true);
[17:38:20] <LindsayM_> its so weird. EVERYTHING should be ok
[17:38:54] <villavida> Hello :)
[17:39:57] <villavida> I've googled my socks off, and cannot figure out how to make a div change in accordance with current time of day. Anyone?
[17:41:25] <LindsayM_> villavida: really? You googled and found NOTHING?
[17:41:30] <visua> in accordance with the time of day?
[17:41:39] <visua> fall in line, DIV! it's 8:45!
[17:41:43] <villavida> Hahaha
[17:41:47] <villavida> That's the one.
[17:42:06] <LindsayM_> villavida:  yea.. i just googled and found quite a few different ones based on whether you want the user's time or the server time
[17:42:38] <villavida> The server time is what I'm looking for
[17:42:55] <LindsayM_> villavida:  i suggest you google again
[17:43:08] <duch_kazatel> villavida you cannot know the “Server time” through javascript
[17:43:18] <duch_kazatel> without exposing that through the page somehow.
[17:43:52] <villavida> What I have is a very simple webshop, which I want to echo as open or closed, depending on what time it is
[17:44:12] <LindsayM_> villavida:  is your server in the same location as you?
[17:44:20] <visua> you want to close your webshop?
[17:44:26] <LindsayM_> lol
[17:44:29] <visua> like a...brick and mortar?
[17:44:33] <LindsayM_> hahaha
[17:44:36] <villavida> LindsayM_ : I'll just adjust accordingly
[17:44:45] <visua> I read an article about this somewhere from some Tim Burners Lee I think
[17:44:51] <villavida> visua: its a delivery service sort of thing. and yeah, brick and mortar would be best
[17:44:53] <visua> he quoted the same scenario about a client
[17:45:06] <visua> where they wanted the webshop to go offline at night
[17:45:07] <LindsayM_> hahaah
[17:45:23] <villavida> :)
[17:45:26] <LindsayM_> villavida:  its still ridiculous to CLOSE a site during off hours
[17:45:26] <visua> Or you know B&H closes on Sunday I think
[17:45:36] <LindsayM_> haha
[17:45:36] <visua> its the Sabbath
[17:45:47] <villavida> LindsayM_ : I'm not closing a site. I'm changing a div
[17:46:01] <visua> villavida just use php
[17:46:05] <visua> or whatever your serverside language is
[17:46:05] <villavida> Just to let my users now that .. Nope.. Aint happenin'
[17:46:06] <LindsayM_> B&H is jewish..
[17:46:12] <LindsayM_> Sunday sabbath is christian
[17:46:17] <visua> LindsayM_ yeah yeah
[17:46:25] <LindsayM_> villavida:  umm.. OR you can give delivery times available..
[17:46:29] <LindsayM_> villavida:  you need to rethink
[17:46:46] <villavida> LindsayM_ : I could, but I am also using this project as a learning experience
[17:47:00] <LindsayM_> and god forbid you learn to think things through properly
[17:47:13] <villavida> Have I offended you?
[17:47:22] <visua> lol learning.
[17:47:25] <LindsayM_> the most important learning experience you can have is to actually learn how to do things correctly the first time
[17:47:31] <LindsayM_> and think through and plan out
[17:47:42] <villavida> I fail to see your point here
[17:47:47] <LindsayM_> I help more people who haven't organized their idea properly than I would like to think about.
[17:48:10] <LindsayM_> HALP! I HAVE 587 PAGES ON MY SITE AND NOW I NEED TO CHANGE ONE LABEL ACROSS ALL OF THEM!
[17:48:24] <villavida> Haha okay. Good thing I'm not one of them
[17:48:24] <LindsayM_> villavida:  point.. what you want to do will never be a real case problem
[17:48:37] <villavida> LindsayM_: Very well. Thank you for your help
[17:48:38] <LindsayM_> so learn to think things through and understand why you might need things
[17:48:40] <LindsayM_> and why you dont
[17:48:42] <LindsayM_> anyways...
[17:48:52] <LindsayM_> I still need help with this silly BBQ hash thing
[17:49:08] <villavida> I know exactly why I need it. I just want to see if it's possible.
[17:49:20] <villavida> There is no real life need for it, as I can just post opening hours in plain text
[17:49:20] <visua> anything is possible at zombocom
[17:49:22] <LindsayM_> villavida:  no... your "use case" is useless
[17:49:42] <villavida> LindsayM_: Useless, it's not. Novel, trivial, childish.. Maybe.
[17:50:00] <villavida> Sorry to step on your precious toes with my silly noobness
[17:50:29] <LindsayM_> my toes are precious.... but you haven't stepped on them with your newbieness
[17:50:39] <LindsayM_> its more you lack of logic
[17:50:48] <visua> i read that as totes
[17:50:52] <visua> precious totes.
[17:50:57] <LindsayM_> totes ma-gotes
[17:51:04] <visua> i was thinking tote bags
[17:51:07] <villavida> How is assuming I lack a sense of logic given one example of what I'd like to implement anymore logical than what I am doing?
[17:51:08] <villavida> Bazing!
[17:51:09] <visua> but yeah, that too.
[17:51:43] <LindsayM_> wut?
[17:51:50] <LindsayM_> http://www.ispot.tv/ad/75am/sprint-lizzy-and-kims-call
[17:51:56] <LindsayM_> totes ma gotes
[17:52:51] <LindsayM_> can anyone tell me why I get an error saying the property of deparams is undefined even though when I log it in the console its perfectly fine? http://bscphoto.dev.creativesupplyco.net/portfolio-image/#filter=.weddings-engagements
[17:52:58] <LindsayM_> (test via clicking one of the yellow links)
[17:53:26] <duch_kazatel> LindsayM_ I’m getting “$ is undefined”
[17:53:39] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  you are???
[17:53:40] <LindsayM_> HOW?!
[17:53:49] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  what line?
[17:54:52] <LindsayM_> this is what I get when I click through http://cl.ly/image/2D1X2y1t151Z
[17:55:08] <LindsayM_> I have no $ in my code. I'm using the no conflict jQuery right now
[17:55:52] <duch_kazatel> line 154 in init.js
[17:56:05] <duch_kazatel> var hashOptions = $.deparam.fragment();
[17:56:09] <LindsayM_> OMG
[17:56:10] <LindsayM_> wtf
[17:56:16] <LindsayM_> why didn't I get that exact error!
[17:56:23] <duch_kazatel> I use firebug for that reason.
[17:56:28] <villavida> Im getting no error, but no pictures either
[17:56:47] <villavida> I had the same problem using isotope once, and added :not(.feature) do the data-option-value
[17:56:56] <LindsayM_> wait.. hold on.. that gives me an entirely different error now saying jQuery is not defined
[17:56:58] <LindsayM_> That doesnt make sense
[17:56:59] <villavida> Might be a newb comment, I'm still gonna throw it out there
[17:57:03] <LindsayM_> Also gives me $this is not defined now
[17:57:11] <LindsayM_> villavida:  no
[17:57:30] <LindsayM_> villavida:  isotope is working fine. I'm having issues with browser history
[17:57:46] <villavida> LindsayM_: ok
[17:58:03] <villavida> I'm not getting any errors
[17:58:20] <villavida> but then again, the wedding photos are the only I see
[17:58:28] <LindsayM_> duch_kazatel:  why would chrome give different errors than firebug?
[17:58:34] <LindsayM_> this is just confusing hte heck out of me
[17:58:46] <duch_kazatel> because chrome is weird
[17:58:51] <LindsayM_> villavida:  look at the source. you aren't going to see anything else. This is a test site
[17:59:09] <LindsayM_> villavida:  please stop confusing the conversation
[17:59:35] <villavida> Roger
[18:00:49] <duch_kazatel> LindsayM_ so if you change line 154 what do you get?
[18:01:06] <LindsayM_> Ok.. error is now gone
[18:01:18] <LindsayM_> a new one now cropped up which I think I can figure out
[18:01:38] <duch_kazatel> if ( $this.hasClass('selected') ) { - i’ll bet you’re not defining $this
[18:02:26] <LindsayM_> yep.. accidentally had that line commented out
[18:02:34] <LindsayM_> I was trying to tweak little things and forgot to undo that
[18:02:41] <LindsayM_> working fine now
[18:02:44] <LindsayM_> well almost
[18:02:46] <LindsayM_> THAT PART is
[18:03:03] <LindsayM_> but I don't understand why the url is #filter=.portrait-photography when it SHOULD just be /portrait-photography
[18:04:58] <LindsayM_> I thought that deparam separates out the filter :
[18:05:01] <LindsayM_> oops
[18:05:14] <LindsayM_> filter: my-filter so that my-filter is what is used in the pushState
[18:05:29] <LindsayM_> if you look at the docs, thats what it says anyways http://isotope.metafizzy.co/docs/hash-history-jquery-bbq.html
[18:05:37] <hpekdemi1> is there a template system where I can use non existent html nodes?
[18:06:01] <hpekdemi1> in PURE js I need to declare the html nodes before I can insert JSON data
[18:06:19] <hpekdemi1> I need a templat engine where I can appen node ad hoc.
[18:06:22] <hpekdemi1> +e
[18:06:26] <hpekdemi1> +d
[18:07:32] <duch_kazatel> hpekdemi1 you mean before you insert to the DOM?
[18:07:41] <duch_kazatel> hpekdemi1 you want to look at document fragments.
[18:17:46] <LindsayM_> this is weird.. it's stripping the hashtag just to put it BACK into the url
[18:17:50] <LindsayM_> gah this is annoying
[18:18:19] <LindsayM_> everything I'm seeing inthe console makes sense and it is what I believe it should be based on the docs
[18:18:37] <LindsayM_> but its just not putting the proper piece of the data into the url for rht hash change
[18:18:41] <LindsayM_> wtf
[18:32:05] <tds5016> hi all.
[18:32:39] <tds5016> I'm havin an issue with on('click', function(){}) not working the way I'd expect.
[18:32:53] <tds5016> http://pastie.org/8750512
[18:33:16] <tds5016> for some reason when I click on the button that shoud've been selected, I seem to always get the last id....
[18:33:22] <tds5016> not the id I'd expect.
[18:33:36] <tds5016> it seems like I'm doing something stupid here.
[18:34:03] <hpekdemi1> which JSON template engine would you recommend?
[18:34:21] <systemfault> What is a JSON template engine?
[18:34:30] <mimoo> XD
[18:34:39] <tds5016> or am I just doing something incredibly stupid here?
[18:35:00] <tds5016> how SHOULD I be passing the argument when I'm in .on('click', function(){})
[18:35:01] <tds5016> ?
[18:36:09] <hpekdemi1> systemfault: getJSON and put it in a preformated template
[18:36:16] <hpekdemi1> there are thousand of them. google
[18:36:41] <systemfault> Give me one.
[18:38:26] <tds5016> systemfault: handlebars has worked pretty well for me.
[18:38:45] <systemfault> tds5016: That's a HTML templating engine, it works really well
[18:38:46] <hpekdemi1> systemfault: PURE js
[18:38:48] <tds5016> this issue I'm facing is infuriating :-(
[18:39:01] <hpekdemi1> I give you more: json-template, mustache.js
[18:39:09] <hpekdemi1> handlebars
[18:39:10] <hpekdemi1> etc.
[18:39:31] <systemfault> They're all HTML templating engines.. so.. where's the JSON?
[18:39:55] <systemfault> Do you think you're getting JSON back when you call getJSON?
[18:40:49] <hpekdemi1> systemfault: I don't think that
[18:40:50] <hpekdemi1> I know it.
[18:41:13] <hpekdemi1> systemfault: yes. I mean html templating for JSON
[18:41:29] <systemfault> For JavaScript you mean?
[18:41:39] <systemfault> Since you don't understand what JSON is.
[18:42:12] <hpekdemi1> systemfault: wtf are you talking about?
[18:42:27] <systemfault> Good night bro.
[18:42:35] <tds5016> systemfault: .... JSON is not a language....
[18:43:02] <systemfault> tds5016: JSON is serialized data... it's a string.
[18:43:08] <hpekdemi1> LOL
[18:43:17] <tds5016> .........
[18:43:22] <hpekdemi1> does he always act like this?
[18:43:33] <systemfault> tds5016: If you call getJSON, you're basically getting a string JSON.parse is called on it.
[18:43:41] <systemfault> It's the basics guys.
[18:43:50] <tds5016> I know what json is and how it works....
[18:44:00] <tds5016> I don't understand what you mean by a templating engine for it...
[18:44:09] <hpekdemi1> systemfault: hold on. you're telling us the methods behind it. I talk about JSON as a data structure.
[18:44:46] <systemfault> tds5016: I never asked for a templating engine for it... its our friend hpekdemi1 who wants a templating engine for JSON.
[18:45:03] <systemfault> Really tried to tell him it didn't make any sense...
[18:45:10] <systemfault> Without success.
[18:45:29] <hpekdemi1> tds5016: I'm writing a web app for my API. and the API is returning information in JSON format. I want to load JSON and parse it into a preformatted HTML template. since it is on client side I need a template engine
[18:45:33] <hpekdemi1> to do this.
[18:45:48] <tiron> anyone know of a flatfile CMS with a backend/in-browser editor?
[18:45:51] <hpekdemi1> systemfault: you get offensive.
[18:45:53] <tds5016> handlebars worked pretty well for me.
[18:45:54] <tds5016> lol.
[18:46:01] <systemfault> Love handlebars.
[18:46:03] <tds5016> that's exactly what it's for :-)
[18:46:14] <systemfault> Handlebars has nothing to do with JSON though.
[18:46:16] <hpekdemi1> ok I will try out. handlebars is the only one I didn't try yet.
[18:46:31] <hpekdemi1> systemfault: no fucking template engine has to do with JSON.
[18:46:35] <hpekdemi1> are you high or something?
[18:46:56] <systemfault> 10 minutes ago: hpekdemi1: which JSON template engine would you recommend?
[18:47:09] <hpekdemi1> systemfault: I told you that I meant a HTML template
[18:47:16] <hpekdemi1> or to be more precise: javascript template.
[18:47:25] <hpekdemi1> but you don't read.
[19:13:09] <hpekdemi1> tds5016: handlebars is nice. thank you
[20:08:09] <Technodrome> got a question
[20:08:30] <Technodrome> does anything in the jquery world exist , to turn any a link to a certain class if the link is the current page?
[20:08:38] <Technodrome> there has to be something for this right? heheh
[20:50:37] <sheilablackrose> hi guys, how do i save prev element div with a class mydiv?
[20:59:08] <sheilablackrose> ho wdo i get the previous div on the same level with a classname mydiv
[21:08:45] <inahandizha> http://VisitsToMoney.com/index.php?refId=386970
[21:47:34] <the8thbit> window.onresize does not detect fullscreen/unfullscreen. How can I detect these?
[23:15:46] <GoSox> so if i have a selector with multiple IDs, and a callback function, does that callback function get called multiple times? For example:
[23:16:30] <GoSox> $("#id1,#id2,#id3).slideDown(200,function() { alertt(); });
[23:16:46] <GoSox> in this case, am i supposed to get three alert windows?
[23:17:07] <kevireilly> GoSox: iirc, they will all slideDown at the same time and hit the callback once when complete
[23:17:45] <GoSox> thats what i expected to happen, but what i seem to be getting is simultaneous animation, then a callback hit for each of them
[23:18:16] <kevireilly> i must be twippin then.. lemme give it a whirl
[23:18:16] <GoSox> its actually .hide( ) not .slideDown( )
[23:20:22] <kevireilly> GoSox: yeah seems i'm recalling incorrectly.. also occurs with fadeOut
[23:20:51] <kevireilly> GoSox: another option is a class which should only hit the callback once
[23:21:14] <GoSox> well, theres an easy fix in my code, now that i know it works this way
[23:21:20] <GoSox> i guess it does make some sense but
[23:21:28] <GoSox> i was not expecting this behavior,t hats for sure
[23:21:51] <kevireilly> hehe class does it too
[23:23:17] <GoSox> i hope i don't do this anywhere else on my site, unknowingly make multiple simultaneous $.post requests, and process the data multiple times without even knowing it.
[23:25:16] <Cork> GoSox: should be fairly simple to see if have the network tab open in the browsers developer tools
[23:25:59] <GoSox> Cork: yeah, if i know to look. i have lots of forms on lots of pages, making lots of requests. I only noticed this because I put a mail() call in the php, and was getting 5 emails for every form submit.
[23:27:22] <kevireilly> GoSox: interesting, you can use promises to prevent that behavior and only receive one callback
[23:27:46] <GoSox> or i can just not put my callbacks on my multiple selector calls :)
[23:28:30] <kevireilly> GoSox: http://jsfiddle.net/H4qet/
[23:40:39] <Tomashe> damn phonegap and jquery mobile is sloww
[23:40:50] <Tomashe> anyone knows how to fix the slow page transitions?
