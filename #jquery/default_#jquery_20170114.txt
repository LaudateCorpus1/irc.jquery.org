[12:43:15] <printForever> why can't I get browser viewport height with jQuery on Chrome and Safari?
[13:05:37] <printForever> Can anyone please help me out?
[13:05:51] <printForever> I'm having problem with odd and even viewport width.
[13:17:04] <printForever> Guys?
[13:17:08] <printForever> jQuery anyone?
[13:21:09] <snover> printForever: just use `window.innerWidth` and `window.innerHeight`.
[13:21:37] <printForever> snover: thanks I've solved that one :) I cant solve the viewport width when its an odd number.
[13:21:54] <snover> i have no idea what that means
[13:27:58] <printForever> ok
[13:28:04] <printForever> so when you resize the browser width
[13:28:09] <printForever> the viewport width changes, right?
[13:28:39] <printForever> sometimes its an odd number like 1001 and sometime its an odd number like 840
[13:28:52] <printForever> I was looking for a way to test if the number is odd or even.
[13:29:56] <printForever> The easiest way was to test if the viewport width number, when divided by 2 has any remainder or not.
[13:30:15] <printForever> However I wanted to know if there is a more elegant solution. snover

[16:14:54] <qakhan> hi all, i am using php for authenticate the user. if user does not exits or input is empty them i am showing the error accordingly.
[16:15:58] <qakhan> when i click submit button it shows the error message and then went away.
[16:16:49] <qakhan> i am using .append() after the submit button div to show error message. here is my code https://fiddle.jshell.net/1mfgny9j/64/
[16:19:31] <qakhan> it seems like page is reloading after .append()

[17:28:46] <Aljone> its killing me really
[17:28:56] <Aljone> 94% memory taken on that
[17:51:27] <snover> put fewer elements on your page.
[17:51:44] <snover> use more specific selectors.

[20:37:45] <jackp10> hi everyone
[20:38:18] <duch_kazatel> Gsham that is trying to use methods that no longer exist in jquery.
[20:38:25] <Gsham> thanks i figured it out
[20:38:30] <Gsham> i changed them from success to done
[20:38:31] <duch_kazatel> check out the latest jquery migrate and go from there.
[20:38:37] <duch_kazatel> you really want .then()
[20:38:38] <duch_kazatel> fwiw.
[20:38:48] <duch_kazatel> although i wouldn't edit their source code, but whatever works ;)
[20:38:57] <Gsham> for now... gotta make it work
[20:39:03] <Gsham> but i told the plugin deve
[20:39:09] <printForever> hello! I really need to get some help figuring out what I'm searching for...
[20:39:10] <Gsham> so maybe they will implement it
[20:39:14] <duch_busy> i woulda just dropped back to the 2.x branch at that point heh
[20:39:19] <duch_busy> either way, good luck :)
[20:39:20] <Gsham> cant
[20:39:26] <Gsham> im using the new fancybox 3.0!!
[20:39:28] <Gsham> amazing
[20:39:32] <Gsham> but needs jquery 3.0
[20:39:38] <printForever> I want to build a function that prints out WORD by WORD by WORD from a sentance of a string.
[20:39:57] <printForever> prints out - appends to the <h3> tag
[20:40:12] <printForever> so it becomes <h3>word word word...</h3>
[20:40:35] <printForever> I know how to set the timeout but I'm not sure how to...
[20:40:47] <printForever> to append, maybe
[20:40:54] <printForever> Is my logic good?
[20:40:59] <printForever> duch_busy?
[20:41:12] <Gsham> now im having an issue with jquery 3.1.1 on safari says indexof is not a function
[20:41:23] <Gsham> but it wont show what script is causing the issue except jquery itself?
[20:41:24] <printForever> Gsham: jQuery hasnt loaded
[20:41:39] <Gsham> ah
[20:41:47] <jackp10> I have a small problem. I have an element in the dom with a data attribute (data-currentspread=1). Using javascript that number gets updated with certain actions. Inside the page, if I try to retrieve the updated value of the data attribute, it returns the original value and not the one updated and I don't know why
[20:41:54] <jackp10> here is a simple example: http://pastebin.com/npg0nTFW
[20:42:12] <jackp10> I don't know why I get served the wrong value
[20:42:34] <printForever> you cant use var currentSpread = $(this).closest('.assetDetails').data('currentspread');
[20:43:03] <Gsham> hmmm but it is loaded
[20:43:13] <Gsham> its only happening in safari
[20:43:21] <printForever> $ - this is jQuery, (this) - is something that was called previously but it doesent work like this. closest to what?
[20:43:34] <printForever> Safari on PC or Mac?
[20:43:41] <printForever> Because Windows Safari is waaaay old

[20:43:46] <Gsham> mac
[20:44:09] <Gsham> this is only happening when using fancybox to load an ajax page
[20:44:28] <Gsham> i dont even have to click the link to load the ajax it happens right when the page loads
[20:44:47] <jackp10> printForever: there is a button further down which get pressed. Once pressed, I go up the levels until I reach assetDetails and then I try to retrieve the currentspread value
[20:44:58] <printForever> This error might be caused by jquery event aliases like .load, .unload or .error deprecated since jQuery 1.8. Look for these aliases in your code and replace them with .on() to register listeners instead. Example:
[20:44:58] <printForever> $(window).load(function(){â€¦});  becomes: $(window).on('load', function(){ ...});
[20:45:13] <printForever> jackp10: ok
[20:45:25] <printForever> jackp10: create an ON CLICK event
[20:45:41] <printForever> and inside that event just $(classofthediv).whatever
[20:45:44] <printForever> and it will work
[20:45:45] <printForever> trust me
[20:45:57] <printForever> but, if you have to follow up with the cloeset
[20:46:13] <jackp10> printForever: I have a click even on the button: $(document).on('click', '.lightbox, .image', function(e) { ...code...});
[20:46:21] <printForever> ok
[20:46:40] <jackp10> inside code, it's the line where I try to retrieve the currentSpread
[20:46:40] <printForever> can you give me a rough idea of how to code looks like?
[20:46:52] <jackp10> sure.. one sec
[20:46:56] <printForever> inside the lightbox?
[20:46:57] <printForever> ok...
[20:47:00] <printForever> I'll wait
[20:47:06] <printForever> CAN SOmeone help ME?
[20:47:08] <printForever> :D
[20:47:14] <printForever> I'm doing my fare share here.
[20:51:04] <printForever> I'm here
[20:54:01] <jackp10> very strange... if I change that line to:  $this.closest('.assetDetails')[0].dataset.currentspread; it worked
[20:54:13] <jackp10> I get the updated content instead of the original one !!
[20:54:15] <jackp10> mah !
[21:15:00] <printForever> ok
[22:15:16] <printForever> hello
[22:15:22] <printForever> everyone are sleepting
[22:15:28] <printForever> (sleeping)
