[05:28:01] <ThijsW> hi there, I have a question about a jquery mobile multipage document
[05:28:55] <ThijsW> I have 3 pages in 1 document: 1. login, 2. register, 3. homescreen (it's going to be an android app build by phonegap
[05:29:57] <ThijsW> now, when I'm logged in and see the homepage, I can click so it goes to a other page like page2.html
[05:30:40] <ThijsW> but when I push the back button, the page will load index.html and display my login page. I wan't it to skip the first 2 pages in my multipage document when the user has logged in. is this possible?
[05:32:41] <codecutter> Not sure why all squares are the same size in this treemap (highchart) https://jsfiddle.net/aepu6dvt/5/ , how do I make the the squares proportional like the one you see here https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/demo/treemap-large-dataset/

[10:28:42] <Woet> pippuccio76: stop spamming the chat
[10:29:02] <Woet> maybe improve your code instead of asking us to debug 490 lines of HTML and a bunch of JS
[10:30:23] <pippuccio76> the 490 line is only to import datatable , the code is this :
[10:30:23] <pippuccio76> $(document).ready(function() {
[10:30:24] <pippuccio76>     $('#example').DataTable();
[10:30:24] <pippuccio76>     
[10:30:24] <pippuccio76>       $('#select_data').datepicker({
[10:30:24] <pippuccio76>             format: "dd-mm-yyyy",
[10:30:24] <pippuccio76>             language: 'it',
[10:30:24] <pippuccio76>             viewMode: 'years',
[10:30:25] <pippuccio76>          });
[10:30:25] <pippuccio76>          
[10:30:26] <pippuccio76>          $("#ricerca_button").click(function(){
[10:30:26] <pippuccio76>              
[10:30:27] <pippuccio76>             var data_selected= $("#select_data").val();
[10:30:27] <pippuccio76>             console.log(data_selected);
[10:31:37] <Woet> pippuccio76: so put it as an external resource, and dont paste in a channel.

[10:40:58] <FullmetalSora> Hello ! I used the select field of autocomplete to pass the value selected by the user in the autocomplete to a javascript function. Now I want to post that value to a php script. How can I achieve this ?
[11:47:18] <panovia> FullmetalSora: You could send an AJAX request
[11:48:41] <FullmetalSora> Yes I ended up finding how to do it by myself. Thanks for your answer anyway :) Now I am trying to use a php variable in the data field of $.post. Do you have any idea how to do this ?
[11:48:54] <FullmetalSora> panovia, *
[11:50:10] <panovia> I don't think you can use PHP variables there
[11:50:38] <panovia> Unless you implement a PHP parser to recognize them
[11:50:48] <panovia> Or does it do that by default already? :D
[11:52:07] <FullmetalSora> I have no idea actually I discovered jquery, ajax and javascript today so I don't really know what's possible and what's not but if I manage to do that it would so awesome for my project panovia
[11:53:39] <panovia> Why do yo need PHP variables you your POST request?
[11:53:43] <panovia> *in your
[12:06:38] <FullmetalSora> panovia,  because i need this variable for a php request in my php script
[12:09:21] <panovia> You can just send a special string to let your PHP script know it should use this variable
[12:09:48] <panovia> or maybe I'm completely misunderstanding what you are asking for
[12:14:32] <FullmetalSora> I could but the special string must be the variable itself because the php script can't figure out what variable it needs by itself panovia
[12:16:38] <panovia> Then make the special string the name of the variable
[12:16:43] <FullmetalSora> Here is the code : http://paste.awesom.eu/AuvP&ln     I want id: $id new to skills: value.
[12:16:54] <FullmetalSora> next to*
[12:17:27] <FullmetalSora> It's an example of course the real i thing i need to pass is not a simple number but that's the idea
[12:18:08] <FullmetalSora> The input type and document.write are things i am trying at the moment to make it work
[12:18:18] <panovia> Ah, so you need to read the POST parameters of the request form PHP and use one of these as the value
[12:19:39] <FullmetalSora> Yes i need to use $id as a value just like skills but with $id from php
[12:19:59] <FullmetalSora> I found this but it doesn't seem to work http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18230294/calling-a-php-variable-in-jquery
[12:20:33] <panovia> JQuery is completely unrelated to that, it all on the PHP site
[12:26:26] <FullmetalSora> Do you have an idea on how to do it panovia ?
[12:30:11] <panovia> No, sorry. Maybe try in ##php
[12:31:46] <FullmetalSora> ok panovia, thanks for your time
[12:32:01] <panovia> No problem
[16:07:18] <Hashirama> I am loading css using jquery butâ€¦ i do not see it taking effect

[17:02:00] <GoSox> Greetings. I have a question about debounceing
[17:02:50] <GoSox> i've read about it and found lots of code blurbs for implementing it. But i wrote my own and its super short. Is there some other aspect of debouncing I'm missing? I feel like this is all I need to accomplish the goal?
[17:02:54] <GoSox> https://jsfiddle.net/xhb8523d/
[17:03:21] <GoSox> in this case, a function called my_http_request_function( ) that will only get called after 1 second of idleness in the input
[17:18:37] <GoSox> Also, moving on a bit, is there any kind of general consensus on what the ideal amount of time is for the delay on a debounced input processing function?
[19:33:40] <luck_> guys i'm getting crazy:
[19:33:56] <luck_> i got this script (https://pastebin.com/tJstERge) and this php (https://pastebin.com/qNdj2079)
[19:34:13] <luck_> could anyone explain me why i get an alert with a lot of html code? i can't explain this xD
[20:14:34] <cannap> easy alert(response);
[20:14:40] <cannap> this is the alert and response is the html code
[20:14:53] <cannap> maybe you get a 404 erro
[20:14:59] <cannap> wrong url or 500 server error
[20:15:05] <cannap> standard html error pages comes back
[20:15:29] <cannap> because ajax url is wrong what is the status code of the response
[20:16:45] <luck_> it was because of ci controller
[20:16:53] <luck_> been debugging 2837478234 h and didnt even check that
