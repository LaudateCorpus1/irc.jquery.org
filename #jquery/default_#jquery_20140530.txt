[00:03:57] <acidjazz> ok i got this css issue i always run into and have no idea.. desktop version is a two column copy layout so i float right a div and float left another.. mobile version they need to stack.. in order to properly flaot right in the HTML i need that text to be above the flaoted left text... but for mobile stacking.. what do?
[00:44:40] <nezuvian> hello all! Is there a way to "extract" the themeing from jquerymobile? I'd like to use the form elements for mobile and such, but don't need the transitions/ajax handling, etc.
[02:13:43] <ussher_> is there a way to see if a textarea contains a url, and if it does, get that URL into a var?
[02:15:27] <diverdude> Hi, how do i update already loaded pdf in an embed element?
[02:20:26] <xec> ussher_: sure, but making a regex that will accurately match urls can be tricky
[02:21:31] <xec> ussher_: if you don't need it to bee very precise it's pretty straight forward
[02:21:36] <ussher_> is there a way to see if a textarea contains a url, and if it does, get that URL into a var?   there are a couple of regex here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/494035/how-do-you-pass-a-variable-to-a-regular-expression-javascript
[02:22:13] <ussher_> just want to get the url string to pass out to server side for more processing.  dont want to pass the whole text area just to see if there is url in there or not if possible.
[02:22:46] <xec> ussher_: there are no url matching regexes at that link?
[02:23:45] <ussher_> sorry, ive been to many links.  the one i have is var urlPattern = new RegExp("(http|https)://[\w-]+(\.[\w-]+)+([\w.,@?^=%&amp;:/~+#-]*[\w@?^=%&amp;/~+#-])?");
[02:24:53] <ussher_> xec: found it, is this link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8188645/javascript-regex-to-match-a-url-in-a-field-of-text
[02:28:55] <xec> ussher_: http://jsfiddle.net/3kVRe/
[02:29:40] <xec> ussher_: i dunno how that regex of yours is supposed to work and it doesnt seem to match "http://jsfiddle.net/" so i made my own there
[02:30:01] <xec> it just looks for https://whatever
[02:30:05] <xec> erer -s
[02:30:25] <ussher_> your ROCK xec.  Thats perfect.  thanks.
[02:31:51] <xec> it seems to return null every other time i type something lol
[02:31:55] <xec> don't ask me
[02:34:55] <ussher_> Ill figure that out.  Just trying to implement it in my code now.
[02:42:26] <skullcrasher> is a submit event fired on jquery $.ajax?
[02:43:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hello. How to do an ajax call to get data right before a form is opened? And then display that data retrieved from the ajax call in the form
[02:43:55] <xec> skullcrasher: no
[02:43:56] <skullcrasher> it seems that because of bubbling my form is sent multiple times
[02:44:26] <skullcrasher> as i have on submit handler an alter the formdata before sending it with ajax
[02:44:39] <xec> skullcrasher: are you preventing the default submit action?
[02:44:53] <skullcrasher> yes
[02:45:01] <skullcrasher> on('click ... e.preventDefault();
[02:45:17] <xec> yeah that's not a submit handler, that's a click handler
[02:45:28] <skullcrasher> oh sry... on('submit ofc :D
[02:45:33] <xec> ok good :)
[02:45:37] <skullcrasher> this.form.on('submit', $.proxy(this.sendForm,this));
[02:46:11] <skullcrasher> it's just that i have several other forms in the hierarchy
[02:46:34] <skullcrasher> and if any of them is sent the submit bubbles up and this form is sent to ... but it shouldn't
[02:46:41] <xec> you can't nest <form>s if that's what you mean
[02:47:01] <skullcrasher> i think it's nested automatically
[02:47:12] <xec> ? as in by cms?
[02:47:22] <skullcrasher> i have plugins that instanciate other plugins sometimes :)
[02:47:29] <skullcrasher> yes
[02:47:44] <skullcrasher> so there are several forms ...
[02:48:00] <xec> well that might be the issue then
[02:48:09] <xec> you can have several forms but never inside eachother
[02:48:09] <skullcrasher> yes, but I don't know how to fix it :)
[02:48:55] <skullcrasher> but also, the forms are not send with submit. I always intercept the submit and send per ajax
[02:49:08] <xec> which is one of the reasons i utterly hate asp.net webforms, it basically wraps your every page in a huge <form> :( :(
[02:49:13] <skullcrasher> there should not be a submit event
[02:50:08] <skullcrasher> the good thing is i write the plugins myself so i can change the code
[02:52:40] * xec is off to lunch
[02:52:43] <xec> good luck ;p
[02:52:52] <ussher_> xec:  got it working.  thanks.
[03:07:07] <skullcrasher> xec: got it :D
[03:07:40] <skullcrasher> there were buttons without type="button" and they triggered the submit in the form ....
[03:08:20] <xec> haha, yea that would do it :)
[03:08:31] <xec> well spotted
[03:09:03] <skullcrasher> now works well :P
[03:09:18] <xec> calls for a celebration
[03:09:24] * xec eats some more noodles
[03:09:34] <skullcrasher> ^^
[03:10:45] <skullcrasher> btw is it reasonable to set e.stopPropagation() if I have nested forms (unfortunately)?
[03:17:56] <xec> skullcrasher: i'm not sure. i believe the browser is going to ignore the nested forms
[03:18:20] <xec> as in, just the outermost <form> is put into the dom
[03:20:23] <xec> skullcrasher: http://jsfiddle.net/5Yxaq/

[03:24:31] <lostInParadise> I'm writing a large modular application. When I can, I'm breaking down each logical piece into it's own jQuery module. There are times when I want to communicate between two plugins - what's the best practice for doing this, a pub/sub event model?
[03:56:28] <maja> is there any way i can interject my code before another function gets called
[03:56:35] <maja> the calling event is on click
[03:57:10] <maja> but another script also uses the tag to make its events
[03:57:31] <maja> and i just want to change around a bit of data before the other script happens
[03:58:01] <brunoais> maja, I didn't understand
[03:58:13] <brunoais> Hum...
[03:58:25] <brunoais> maja, do you want to place 2 click events on the same Node?
[03:58:55] <maja> in a way yes
[03:59:05] <brunoais> maja, then just do it
[03:59:08] <maja> i am using a social plugin
[03:59:11] <brunoais> just place the event listeners
[03:59:29] <brunoais> What's the problem with placing the event listeners?
[03:59:48] <maja> but i want to dynamicly change some html data tags
[03:59:48] <maja> but the other event fires of first
[04:00:12] <maja> i can get my event to happen
[04:00:32] <brunoais> you are not saying much. You have loads of conditions that you are not telling me
[04:00:43] <maja> i just want to set so that my function will always run first on the event
[04:00:43] <brunoais> if you don't tell what you need, I jsut go to the more recurring situation
[04:00:45] <brunoais> what's yours?
[04:01:32] <maja> i shall see if i can work my problem diffrently, thanks :)
[04:03:12] <mikey85> if anyone owns a network server, then let's collaborate. Thank you :)
[04:47:15] <Santozzz2123> Hey Guys,…just workin with jQM - but i have a problem.
[04:47:53] <Santozzz2123> I got a fixed header/footer and a flexible content. So…you can click page by page and move trough the content, by still havin a fixed header/footer. If i click on „Back“ it does not go to the top
[04:48:28] <Santozzz2123> It seems like the scrollbar has saved the old position… but i want to get back to the top of the page, when i click on „back“ (moving to the site before“
[04:48:44] <Santozzz2123>         <script>
[04:48:45] <Santozzz2123>             $(function() {
[04:48:46] <Santozzz2123>               $.mobile.defaultHomeScroll = 0;
[04:48:47] <Santozzz2123>               });
[04:48:48] <Santozzz2123>             </script>
[04:48:51] <Santozzz2123> doestn solve the problem :-/
[04:48:52] <slax0r> no no no no
[04:48:56] <slax0r> never paste code in a channel
[04:48:59] <slax0r> use a pastebin for that
[04:49:02] <Santozzz2123> oh okay :o sorry
[04:49:38] <slax0r> never used jqm, but can't you just tell it to scroll back to top upon navigation?
[04:52:04] <Santozzz2123> i dont know how… i’m not so good at JS/HTML :-/
[04:53:34] <slax0r> again, I never used jqm, but in regular jq it would be $(document).scrollTop(0)
[04:53:51] <Santozzz2123> w8 i’ll try
[04:54:43] <Santozzz2123> doesn’t solve the problem :- / …hmm… i think it has sth. to do with positions

[04:56:34] <joker_89> how can i execute a jquery script after an ajax request?
[04:56:49] <systemfault> joker_89: You execute it in the callback.
[04:56:58] <joker_89> how?
[05:06:05] <alistair> hey, can anyone help me figure out how best to make request.origin updatable via the input form, and also refresh the directions so the tha map and panel are updated...
[05:06:07] <alistair> http://jsbin.com/pewek/1/edit?html,js,output
[05:08:31] <d0de> I can't seem to wrap my head around promises. Can someone show me a really rough outline of how to use promises to do something once feedLoaded() has finished for every call in the for loop? http://jsfiddle.net/f4k7z/
[05:09:26] <d0de> in my code, feed.load(feedLoaded) makes an asynchronous call to the google feeds API, which calls feedLoaded as the callback with the result
[05:10:21] <alistair> afk, going for lunch :) thanks for looking!
[05:10:50] <systemfault> d0de: what is feedObject?
[05:10:58] <systemfault> *feedObj
[05:11:24] <d0de> feedObj holds a bunch of strings, each of which has the URI of an rss feed
[05:11:44] <systemfault> d0de: So it's an array? If so, never use for/in with arrays.
[05:12:07] <d0de> systemfault, it's not an array (though perhaps it should be)
[05:12:16] <systemfault> ah, it's an object, I see
[05:12:35] <d0de> it's an object like : feedObj = { feed1: 'http://foo.org/feed' } etc
[05:12:44] <systemfault> d0de: I'll write you some pseudo-code
[05:13:22] <d0de> systemfault, thanks very much! I've been trying to learn promises for a while but I just can't seem to undestand the examples in the docs
[05:14:13] <systemfault> d0de: The jQuery implementation of promise is total crap… :/
[05:18:27] <systemfault> d0de: It would look a bit like this http://jsfiddle.net/f4k7z/1/
[05:20:16] <systemfault> But like I said… jQuery's implementation of promise is awfully bad.
[05:20:46] <santozzz1212> Hmm…is there a possibilty to say my scrollbar „when the user goes back -> return to scrollposition 1px top“ or sth like that? (jQuery Mobile)
[05:21:11] <d0de> systemfault, thanks so much for that. I'll try to get it working just now. I really appreciate you taking the time to help me!
[05:32:15] <d0de> I haven't used $.each() before, it's pretty cool
[05:35:31] <d0de> systemfault, in http://jsfiddle.net/f4k7z/1/, what will arrayOfResult on line 44 consist of?
[05:36:29] <systemfault> d0de: An array of the promise results,  something like [resultFromFeed1, resultFromFeed2, resultFromFeed3]
[05:36:45] <d0de> oooh I see, from feed.load()
[05:37:27] <systemfault> d0de: If you want to get serious with promises, take a look at "Bluebird" or "Q"
[05:51:52] <d0de> systemfault, would you take a look at this? it runs, but only dumps the object for one feed, and some other non-object stuff http://jsfiddle.net/n25Fu/
[05:52:25] <d0de> http://jsfiddle.net/n25Fu/1/ is probably better to look at
[05:53:13] <d0de> it dumps the object for the first feed in feedObj only
[05:54:26] <systemfault> d0de: let me see
[05:59:40] <alistair> Hi can anyone help me hook up the input field to update the origin? http://jsbin.com/pewek/1/edit?html,js,output
[06:00:34] <d0de> systemfault, sorry, connection dropped for a few minutes
[06:04:36] <systemfault> d0de: Ah, thought you were gone
[06:04:48] <d0de> did you take a look?
[06:05:50] <systemfault> d0de: Yeah...
[06:06:06] <systemfault> I forgot how bad jQuery's implementation was… sorry
[06:06:45] <systemfault> d0de: basically… the argument of .then is not arrayOfResults...
[06:07:01] <systemfault> d0de: It's result1, result2, result….N
[06:08:35] <systemfault> d0de: http://jsfiddle.net/n25Fu/2/
[06:08:44] <d0de> systemfault, oh I see, thanks for the explanation
[06:09:04] <systemfault> Hopefully, you will understand with the "paste"
[06:09:15] <d0de> thanks!
[06:10:37] <d0de> systemfault, that's perfect, thanks so much for your help
[06:10:43] <goooogleee>  have kind of an in depth question so i pastebined it http://pastebin.com/vYFiy4bP any response advice, tweaks , etc, is greatly appreciated. Im just trying to like figure out how to implement the php i was using to work with the jquery i now want to use
[06:10:52] <systemfault> d0de: You're welcome.
[06:12:09] <d0de> could you explain how  " return $.map(arguments, function(feed) { return feed.feed; }); " works? just to help my learning a bit?
[06:13:06] <systemfault> d0de: Do you understand what a "map" function does?
[06:14:06] <d0de> no :\
[06:14:10] <systemfault> d0de: It's a function that takes a collection (array in our case) + function as arguments and returns a new collection with the function applied on every element of the collection
[06:14:41] <systemfault> Basically $.map([1,2,3], function(n) { return n * 2; }); will return [2,4,6]
[06:15:46] <d0de> how does that get around the problem of .then returning n arguments instead of an array of n objects?
[06:16:28] <d0de> I mean, it clearly does, because it works :D but I don't quite understand how
[06:19:27] <systemfault> d0de: You could have returned a copy of arguments instead. But the thing is that the "result" of the feed transaction doesn't return the feed only.
[06:19:38] <systemfault> So I mapped on the results to only get the feeds.
[06:19:42] <systemfault> And not the metadata.
[06:20:11] <systemfault> Change feed.feed to just feed in the function, you'll see the metadata
[06:20:44] <d0de> this is a dumb question, but is "arguments" a special argument of some kind?
[06:21:10] <systemfault> Yes, it's an "Array-like" variables that contains all the arguments passed to the function.
[06:21:18] <systemfault> *variable
[06:21:20] <d0de> ahhhhhhhhhh that was the part I was missing :)
[06:22:04] <d0de> I can see how that could be useful!!
[06:22:33] <systemfault> Because $.when sucks and returns arguments… I use the arguments variable to get an array reprensentation
[06:22:40] <systemfault> *representation
[06:39:56] <bberry> I have a group of inputs that need ot have functions 'ran' on change. Should i just do like element.data('changeFxn', fxn) for each element, and then on change run the changeFxn? or should i have a switch statement in the change event that just runs its specific function on change?
[06:41:42] <balor> Is there any one-liner to do $('#selector').append('<li>').putInLI('foo') in order to generate '<li>foo</li>' as appended to whatever #selector selects?
[06:42:06] <balor> I don't want to .append('<li>foo</li>')

[07:31:11] <hxm> i have a page which load other pages in a #content, when the #content is loaded, the main js script wont work because it doesnt update the #content html tags
[07:31:20] <hxm> i feel like im doing this wrong
[07:31:40] <hxm> where should I load the js files (i do it in the <head>) for get the functions work
[07:31:40] <machty> historical question for yall: how come jQuery never implemented an event capture API?
[07:32:03] <hxm> any reason should exist if they dont did it
[07:32:10] <hxm> thats why I wonder whats the proper way
[07:32:19] <antlong> anyone interested in helping out with an open source sci-fi game? been in development for about 2 weeks. around 15 people working on it now. www.multiverseminer.com
[07:32:19] <systemfault> machty: Simple, you cannot emulate it on older IE.
[07:32:19] <machty> presumably they could have faked it the same way they faked bubbling for netscape
[07:32:25] <machty> s/netscape/IE
[07:32:36] <machty> ah
[07:32:40] <machty> i meant the original
[07:32:48] <systemfault> Anyway… capturing was a retarded idea.
[07:32:48] <machty> netscape was capture-only but they got bubbling working
[07:33:09] <machty> why couldn't you simulate a capture phase?
[07:33:16] <machty> even on IE?
[07:33:20] <machty> performance aside
[07:34:48] <systemfault> machty: I guess you're right… it could be done using an array…. saving the elements at each level…
[07:35:24] <machty> ajpiano:  heya buddy
[07:35:50] <ajpiano> what up machty
[07:35:57] <ajpiano> that's a better q for #jquery-dev if ppl are around
[07:37:38] <hxm> how can I do that "event capture" then?
[07:40:10] <hxm> or can I someone tell me what should I google for get documentation about this
[07:46:26] <antlong> https://dpaste.de/7zkC how do i make it so that 'r' only fires if control is NOT held?
[08:05:39] <BillCriswell> antlong: console.log(event) and I think there's ctrlKey or some conditional?
[08:05:43] <BillCriswell> or some property*
[08:05:55] <antlong> i tried, but its not showing any modifiers
[08:06:52] <BillCriswell> antlong: I'm see a ctrlKey: true in the log.
[08:07:31] <antlong> i did alert(char); inside the case 's'
[08:07:39] <antlong> and it only shows s, so i guess I'm doing it wrong?

[08:08:59] <chrisramon> hey guys, can anyone tell me if this http://pastebin.com/9w1EEiBL will make jquery traverse the dom to find the element?
[08:10:05] <BillCriswell> chrisramon: The $('#section') does, and you don't need to wrap selector in $() again.
[08:11:00] <chrisramon> i know that is not necessary to wrap again, my question is, if y pass the selector to jquery object, it will return the cached version or will traverse the dom again?
[08:11:32] <BillCriswell> chrisramon: I don't think so.
[08:11:46] <BillCriswell> Would be pretty easy to write up a test for it though.
[08:12:31] <BillCriswell> Also, you're using an ID. Are you expecting more than one #section?
[08:13:00] <chrisramon> one section
[08:13:25] <chrisramon> it does traverse the dom, does not return the cached version
[08:13:29] <chrisramon> confirmed ;)
[08:14:40] <antlong> if anyone wants a small side gig, please message me.
[08:15:05] <BillCriswell> chrisramon: I am still confused on why you'd need to do that though.
[08:15:14] <BillCriswell> Does this not work as you'd expect? http://jsbin.com/qenumixo/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:15:44] <bumbar> i'm using select2 and for no matches i create some element with id, and binding with $(document).on("click", "#select2element", ...); doesn't work, why is that?
[08:22:32] <tw2113> bumbar, is the #select2element generated dynamically?
[08:22:50] <tw2113> as part of an ajax response for example
[08:24:52] <bumbar> tw2113, yeah, select2 has constructor parameter that returns a string which it then inserts into dom
[08:25:01] <devc> I have a question regarding jQuery.proxy() vs. function.bind() -- I've created a jsfiddle to show the issue that I was having in my application but now I'm wondering why unbind will apply to ALL instances of the proxy context.
[08:25:02] <devc> http://jsfiddle.net/F4T4f/
[08:25:43] <tw2113> you may need to bind the click event to a dom element that is persistent and then find that ID afterwards
[08:26:13] <tw2113> $('body').on('click', '#select2element', function(){ //stuff });
[08:26:34] <tw2113> i believe that's the right syntax, and you don't need to use body, you can use something else closer to the area
[08:29:00] <bumbar> tw2113, i've been trying that, but it doesn't work
[08:29:44] <tw2113> dunno past that point
[08:32:10] <CrowX-> brunoais, are you there?
[08:32:43] <brunoais> CrowX-, Eh...

[08:32:52] <brunoais> yes
[08:32:55] <CrowX-> :)
[08:32:59] <CrowX-> can I ask you something in private?
[08:33:03] <brunoais> sure
[08:34:51] <devc> In my case, as I animated out a form, and animated in a form - I was using jQuery.proxy() to maintain 'this', in my even handler
[08:35:33] <devc> When I unbinded the old form, I lost the submit handler on the new form, even though the context was in a different Class completely.
[08:36:06] <Jattenalle> is there no way to do a synchronous ajax call in 2.1?
[08:40:14] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: Did they remove the async option?
[08:40:26] <Jattenalle> i can't get it to work :/
[08:40:34] <Jattenalle> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ it's deprecated
[08:40:47] <Jattenalle> just wondering if i'm doing it wrong, or if it's actually removed
[08:41:39] <Jattenalle> no code at the moment, sorry
[08:43:04] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: It says it's deprecated with deferred. You'd just have to use success and fail options I imagine instead of .done() and .fail().
[08:43:43] <Jattenalle> i'll give it another whirl, i think i know what i was doing wrong, we'll see
[08:47:36] <d0de> I'm comparing two strings to see if they match. I want it to be case insensitive. Is there anything faster than doing toLowerCase() on both strings? It's adding about a second to my filter operation
[08:48:39] <d0de> I mean, doing it 10k times is adding about a second :P
[08:49:06] <Jattenalle> store the result of .toLower and use that as the compare for the future
[08:49:13] <Jattenalle> so it'd be slow once
[08:49:15] * Jattenalle shrugs
[08:50:02] <raskel> hello, i dont figure out why the .html() doesn't renders well. i mean, if i use .text(data) to print it and afterwards copy-paste it inside my selector it does render ok, but if i use .html(data) then it looks weird ( css ? ). here is a pic of .text(data): http://i.imgur.com/YDBUiPs.png . here is one after copy-paste inside #selector : http://i.imgur.com/eSsQUnH.png - looks well. and here is one pic of .html(data) : http://i.imgur.com/WTKnerE.png and here
[08:50:02] <raskel> is my code: http://pastie.org/private/fyxdet7xxnxhtcfbxcrrq . i would be really happy to solve it. thanks!
[08:51:08] <devc> d0de: Can you use a regex? (/keyword/i).test(source)
[08:51:17] <d0de> Jattenalle: I am an idiot, thank you
[08:51:37] <Jattenalle> d0de, could probably do it when you load in the values, sure it uses a bit of memory, but meh :P
[08:53:19] <d0de> yeah, I hopped up a couple of functions and found a place where I can do it earlier (and less). Now it adds ~25ms instead of ~1100ms
[09:00:03] <raskel> no idea? :(
[09:01:56] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, nope, i just keep getting a wall with .readyState = 1
[09:02:07] <Jattenalle> i think it's actually removed/disabled/something
[09:03:30] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: http://jsbin.com/diquxexo/1/edit?html,js,output seems ok here
[09:04:13] <Jattenalle> yeah, sorry, i wasnt being specific enough
[09:04:24] <Jattenalle> i need it to return the value directly
[09:04:34] <Jattenalle> ie: var result = $.ajax();
[09:05:26] <devc> raskel: Can you create a jsfiddle so I can play around with it?
[09:05:39] <devc> http://www.jsfiddle.net
[09:06:59] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: So you want to save the result of that request?
[09:07:11] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, i modified your example, and it works.. i must be doing something wrong :/
[09:08:27] <Jattenalle> oh, fixed it
[09:08:28] <BillCriswell> Yeah, probably shouldn't be doing that. Why not just do like var request = $.get('foo.whatever'); request.done(init); and have a function init(response) { /* Start off your things from here */ };
[09:08:30] <Jattenalle> i'm dumb
[09:09:13] <Jattenalle> it's for my game UI thing, i need it to be blocking since it's loading UI widgets.. before it's loaded = nothing to do, and making the code all event driven to work around that would be a pain
[09:09:15] <Jattenalle> but it turns out
[09:09:17] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: All this stuff gets tricky.
[09:09:20] <Jattenalle> i was doing: asynch:
[09:09:25] <Jattenalle> note the h
[09:09:31] <BillCriswell> Oh haha
[09:09:35] <Jattenalle> <3
[09:09:48] <duch_kazatel> it's always something simple!
[09:13:12] <titou> hey
[09:15:30] <titou> I'm looking for a nice solution to find an element but not take care of elements which are children (or grand children) of a specific node
[09:15:46] <duch_kazatel> titou what are you doing with the element?
[09:16:11] <titou> I enable some handlers and get information contained in its attributes
[09:16:38] <duch_kazatel> then you want a basic selector?  unless i'm missing something.
[09:16:51] <duch_kazatel> can you create a fiddle to roughly approximate what you're looking for?
[09:17:21] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Do you work with a company that uses basic selectors? If not, your opinion is invalid.
[09:17:33] <duch_kazatel> hahahahahaha
[09:17:34] <titou> I'll try to explain better duch_kazatel (before the fiddle :)
[09:17:39] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell ++
[09:17:55] <BillCriswell> :)
[09:18:00] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, hah, works perfectly fine <3 thanks for the help
[09:18:15] <duch_kazatel> today might be the day i switch to my real name.  i think that'd help me be a little less abrasive.
[09:18:19] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[09:18:19] <titou> let's imagine a web page where I would like to find A elements excepted A elements contained in "div.foo"
[09:18:37] <titou> A elements can be anywhere
[09:18:47] <duch_kazatel> titou so you want all anchors, EXCEPT for those inside of div.foo?
[09:18:58] <titou> yeah
[09:18:59] <Jattenalle> duch_kazatel, but then how would we recognize you?
[09:19:02] <BillCriswell> What does duch_kazatel mean?
[09:19:22] <duch_kazatel> Jattenalle++
[09:19:39] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell it's a rough translation of another screenname i've used for years.
[09:19:44] <BillCriswell> Ah, nice.
[09:19:53] <antlong> anyone mind if i advertise this gig again. i haven't gotten anything.
[09:20:15] <duch_kazatel> titou you probably want .not()
[09:20:24] <BillCriswell> I used to go by "cynic" on here, but someone actually purchased that nick off me for $100... it was weird, but I was glad I made $100.
[09:20:32] <duch_kazatel> damn
[09:20:39] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell that's surprisingly awesome/
[09:20:40] <titou> duch_kazatel: yeah but I tried many things with .not() but I didn't succeed..
[09:20:43] <BillCriswell> YEs.
[09:21:05] <antlong> I have a paid js gig, about an hours work. if you'd like the link for the details, msg me.
[09:21:23] <BillCriswell> titou: You can do like... $('a').filter(function(){ return $(this).closest('.nope').length === 0; });
[09:21:44] <BillCriswell> titou: That would only returns <a>s not in .nope
[09:22:07] <duch_kazatel> titou http://jsfiddle.net/W7EJL/
[09:22:13] <BillCriswell> IT's pizza o' clock.
[09:22:24] <duch_kazatel> oooh pizza
[09:27:32] <titou> hum thank you BillCriswell and duch_kazatel
[09:27:39] <titou> but I don't want why it does not work for me
[09:27:47] <duch_kazatel> titou we'd have to see your code.
[09:28:00] <titou> in fact I forgot something maybe something important
[09:28:28] <titou> imagine that I do the find from a node which is a div
[09:28:41] <titou> I'll try to update the fiddle maybe it will be more easy to understand
[09:28:55] <duch_kazatel> yeah a fiddle would be awesome.
[09:30:35] <vlknff>  what would be the best way to make vine like whatever video you see is playing on a website? this.focus() ?
[09:30:35] <titou> ok :)
[09:30:41] <titou> http://jsfiddle.net/W7EJL/2/
[09:31:11] <titou> but please don't take care of the "id" of the first div..
[09:31:22] <titou> let's imagine that it is a div like any other
[09:31:50] <duch_kazatel> vlknff huh?  what's the action for "liking" the video?
[09:32:23] <duch_kazatel> titou wut? make an indicative fiddle.  asking me to "imagine" or "pretend" won't end well...
[09:32:47] <titou> arf
[09:33:41] <vlknff> duch_kazatel, excuse me didn't explain very clearly. scrolling down a page with multiple divs and which ever div you are at would play its content and pause if you leave
[09:33:44] <vlknff> does that makes sense
[09:34:00] <duch_kazatel> vladikoff sure you mean the autoplay?
[09:34:07] <vladikoff> duch_kazatel, no u
[09:34:10] <titou> duch_kazatel: ok here it's ok: http://jsfiddle.net/W7EJL/3/
[09:34:37] <duch_kazatel> titou aaah.  easy :)
[09:35:03] <duch_kazatel> titou http://jsfiddle.net/W7EJL/4/
[09:35:43] <duch_kazatel> titou alternatively: http://jsfiddle.net/W7EJL/5/
[09:35:53] <duch_kazatel> you want the direct child of that parent div.
[09:36:00] <titou> grmbl that's really strange since I already checked that kind of thing..
[09:36:02] <Jattenalle> titou, hook into the page scroll event.. check the scroll position against the position of your divs? play the content of div that is in view, stop all others?
[09:36:11] <Jattenalle> err
[09:36:14] <Jattenalle> vlknff, ^^
[09:36:51] <titou> duch_kazatel: no it's not always the direct child ;) otherwise it would be too easy ;)
[09:37:46] <duch_kazatel> titou then the first one i posted should work.
[09:37:56] <titou> I'll try again
[09:38:10] <vlknff> Jattenalle, thank you I'll look into it
[09:38:26] <duch_kazatel> doesn't the default vine player do that automatically?
[09:38:31] <duch_kazatel> or you're trying to create something like it?
[09:38:53] <duch_kazatel> titou it'll ultimately be something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/W7EJL/4/
[09:39:10] <duch_kazatel> using classes/IDs will be a big help here though.
[09:39:14] <titou> duch_kazatel: ok thank you very much
[09:40:53] <titou> ok got the problem again ;)
[09:41:34] <titou> duch_kazatel: indeed it works perfectly if I want to get the first a
[09:41:39] <vlknff> I'm trying to make something way out of my league to be fair. I'm only a 3dartist trying to help my flatmates grad project. http://valkanoff.com/p/brain.html so I need when I press one of these buttons to enable a div and play its content.
[09:42:10] <titou> but if I need to get the second a whereas I'm calling find from the 'ul' point I don't get the a..
[09:42:14] <titou> let's see: http://jsfiddle.net/W7EJL/6/
[09:42:14] <duch_kazatel> titou then i need you to fiddle up a more indicative example.
[09:42:45] <duch_kazatel> titou that selector will never match anything.'
[09:42:54] <duch_kazatel> in your current markup at least.
[09:43:21] <titou> with the "not" it does not work ..
[09:43:25] <titou> without it works
[09:43:48] <duch_kazatel> titou right, because that's finding all anchors inside of that UL...
[09:44:27] <titou> there is no generic solution to get it working and depending from the node where the find is performed?
[09:44:50] <duch_kazatel> titou i still don't understand the problem.
[09:44:58] <duch_kazatel> it seems like you have some really strange requirement.
[09:45:56] <titou> duch_kazatel: I'm developing a kind of toolbox and I initialize the A nodes within that toolbox depending on the attributes of the toolbox
[09:46:04] <titou> but toolboxes can be contained into toolboxes..
[09:46:34] <BillCriswell> titou: So you have nested <a>s?
[09:46:35] <titou> and each A nodes have to be initialized depending on their closest toolbox information (div)
[09:47:25] <titou> thus I parse each DIV node which represents a toolbox and I look for each A elements within that toolbox and I initialize them
[09:47:42] <titou> but I don't want to initialize A nodes depending on other toolboxes contained into the current toolbox initializing
[09:48:01] <titou> do you see the trick or do  you want to see some code?
[09:48:12] <duch_kazatel> titou aaaaah, so you need to recursively find each direct descendent anchor(s) within each div,
[09:48:45] <duch_kazatel> for sanity's sake, I'd give each "toolbox" div a class to start with.
[09:48:52] <duch_kazatel> that makes the rest of this super simple./
[09:49:01] <titou> yeah but A nodes are not direct descendant of toolbox :)
[09:49:05] <titou> duch_kazatel: this is what i did
[09:49:35] <duch_kazatel> titou then you want all anchors that aren't inside of another toolbox.  same basic strategy.
[09:49:51] <titou> duch_kazatel: I'll do another fiddle it will more explicit :)
[09:52:36] <duch_kazatel> kay
[09:53:07] <titou> duch_kazatel: ok got it: http://jsfiddle.net/W7EJL/7/
[09:53:23] <titou> the problem is that the second A element should have its text "B bar" :)
[09:53:36] <titou> foo has been added since it has been parsed by the first "toolbox"
[09:53:41] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[09:55:13] <duch_kazatel> and there may or may not be more than one anchor for each "level" right?
[09:55:45] <titou> there is no limit
[09:55:48] <duch_kazatel> perfect.
[09:55:49] <duch_kazatel> sec.
[09:55:53] <titou> 0, 1 or many A per toolbox
[09:55:58] <duch_kazatel> yep
[10:01:23] <duch_kazatel> sorry bouncing around for different stuff still poking at this.
[10:01:46] <titou> (:
[10:12:17] <d0de> what's the absolute simplest possible way I could pass a JSON object from server-side to client-side ?
[10:13:41] <BillCriswell> d0de: You're way past that aren't you?
[10:14:07] <BillCriswell> An http request. What you're doing now.
[10:14:14] <d0de> BillCriswell - past it in what sense?
[10:14:27] <BillCriswell> I don't know.
[10:15:02] <d0de> basically, I've been trying to build this rss thing 100% client side
[10:15:37] <BillCriswell> Right.
[10:15:58] <d0de> but I need to make a separate request to the google feed api for every feed I want to low. Which is slow as mud for > 6 feeds, even when the cumulative size of the feeds is very small
[10:16:19] <d0de> so I'm wondering if there's some way I build the object server-side and have the client grab it in a single request
[10:16:33] <d0de> to speed up loading
[10:16:38] <BillCriswell> d0de: Oh ok.
[10:16:39] <paulvd> hello, i am trying to add a class to the nth-child which is dynamic, here is the jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/Uy6R7/1/
[10:17:15] <d0de> I guess using node.js or something, but I know nothing about server side programming at all
[10:18:23] <d0de> paulvd, like this? http://jsfiddle.net/Uy6R7/2/
[10:18:25] <clearcut> i have one smaller image positioned over another larger image - i need to get at what x position of larger image is smaller image situated - how?
[10:19:03] <paulvd> d0de: ooo thanks broo
[10:19:37] <d0de> paulvd, np
[10:20:07] <StephenS> I stay strapped
[10:20:27] <BillCriswell> clearcut: That question is confusing. Can you try it again?
[10:20:49] <duch_kazatel> he wants to know what the coords of the smaller image over the larger image?
[10:21:02] <BillCriswell> d0de: http://docs.nodejitsu.com/articles/HTTP/clients/how-to-create-a-HTTP-request does this help?
[10:22:10] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yeah i had no luck following that.
[10:23:24] <d0de> BillCriswell, thanks! But the part I'm a bit more uncertain of is how to serve the JSON object from the node server once I have it. It's an array of objects, how can I learn how to serve it from node.js and also how to request it client-side?
[10:24:40] <BillCriswell> d0de: You would have node output the json object as a string with the right http headers.
[10:25:36] <BillCriswell> then request that route.
[10:25:50] <d0de> sounds complicated :\
[10:27:45] <titou> duch_kazatel: so no idea?
[10:28:58] <BillCriswell> d0de: As are most things.
[10:29:08] <BillCriswell> when you first try to learn them.
[10:29:20] <duch_kazatel> titou like i said, i'm getting pulled around every which way.
[10:29:49] <titou> ok
[10:31:40] <duch_kazatel> titou the issue is that your markup changes around a lot, so it's a lot of work to get context to build things out. you could build up a counter for those parent .toolbox elements and see how far in the toolboxes you are.
[10:32:04] <titou> duch_kazatel: it won't cost much cpu time?
[10:32:09] <duch_kazatel> titou the counter?
[10:32:16] <duch_kazatel> you
[10:32:20] <titou> couting the parents .toolbox
[10:33:26] <titou> duch_kazatel: but it's a good idea
[10:33:32] <duch_kazatel> that's one way to do it.
[10:33:36] <duch_kazatel> not necessarily a great way.
[10:34:02] <antlong> anyone have idea on how to make useful tooltips or modals on things? www.multiverseminer.com
[10:34:21] <antlong> I'm trying to avoid them being too intrusive or obnoxious. maybe even a real tutorial window when you go to the site
[10:34:44] <duch_kazatel> antlong use powertip imo.
[10:34:59] <antlong> let me google it
[10:35:55] <duch_kazatel> titou something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/W7EJL/8/
[10:36:24] <duch_kazatel> not foolproof, but that's where I'
[10:36:26] <duch_kazatel> *where i'd start.
[10:36:43] <antlong> duch_kazatel that is pretty looking
[10:36:47] <antlong> fits the theme in the demo anyway
[10:36:56] <titou> duch_kazatel: thank you very much
[10:37:00] <duch_kazatel> antlong i used to work with the dude that made that.
[10:37:02] <titou> I'll try to implement that idea;)
[10:37:10] <duch_kazatel> titou sure thing.
[10:37:33] <duch_kazatel> titou like I said, not perfect, but it goes in the direction you should be thinking.
[10:38:05] <titou> yes but it does the trick ;)
[10:41:10] <paulvd> d0
[10:41:14] <paulvd> d0de: you around?
[10:44:15] <d0de> paulvd, yeah?
[10:44:35] <d0de> I'm probably the least qualified person here to consult by a factor of a few thousand, but sure
[10:44:41] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[10:44:45] <duch_kazatel> d0de you're fine.
[10:44:48] <paulvd> after that i did this > http://jsfiddle.net/Uy6R7/4/
[10:44:50] <duch_kazatel> sometimes teaching helps you learn.
[10:45:02] <paulvd> but on live site it doenst work weird http://tinyurl.com/l3cq6ew
[10:48:36] <d0de> paulvd, I would at least do something like http://jsfiddle.net/Uy6R7/5/ but where is it supposed to go on the live site?
[10:49:02] <duch_kazatel> paulvd are you just trying to enter something to your sitew?
[10:49:12] <duch_kazatel> and if so, why are you using javascript?
[10:49:27] <paulvd> yes
[10:49:31] <antlong> duch_kazatel do you know of anything else that would look cool and enrich the experience?
[10:49:34] <antlong> duch_kazatel our ux/ui sucks
[10:49:35] <paulvd> its only for mobile
[10:49:51] <paulvd> and adding is dynamic
[10:49:58] <paulvd> i know crazy
[10:50:09] <duch_kazatel> btw you have display: none; set on it.
[10:50:12] <duch_kazatel> it's in there though.
[10:50:26] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/zFrzmvj.png
[10:50:54] <duch_kazatel> it's also in your header.
[10:51:16] <paulvd> oh well ok thanks
[10:51:27] <paulvd> didnt realise that
[10:51:42] <duch_kazatel> and still not a good job for javascript - use media queries instea.d
[10:52:29] <paulvd> yea but they wont be adding that html themselves
[10:52:35] <paulvd> they are lazy
[10:52:50] <duch_kazatel> huh?  why can't you add it?
[10:52:56] <d0de> paulvd, are you using javascript because you want the position to be dynamic, after the middle paragraph?
[10:53:03] <paulvd> yes
[10:53:12] <paulvd> and also coz they can't add that bit of html
[10:53:40] <duch_kazatel> yeah but why?
[10:54:08] <paulvd> they're not tech oriented, they lost their mind when they saw that code
[10:54:16] <duch_kazatel> okay.  then do it yourself?
[10:54:33] <paulvd> yeah but its dynamic pages
[10:54:35] <duch_kazatel> trying to prevent you from getting a call about how something is broken or whatever.
[10:54:36] <paulvd> wordpress
[10:54:59] <paulvd> i explained them already
[10:54:59] <duch_kazatel> don't really care tbh.  i work at a place that learned why you don't dynamically inject shit using JS like that.
[10:55:16] <duch_kazatel> it's a hard lesson to learn, but a good one.
[10:55:53] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell what's pizza like in philly?
[10:55:56] <duch_kazatel> is it weird?
[10:56:05] <paulvd> the guys who just know how to read email, and send it, imagine how their situation will be
[10:56:24] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: It's different all over. I could choose just about any style I want in a 5 minutes walk.
[10:56:35] <duch_kazatel> paulvd exactly.  which is why it's your responsibility to help them not do the wrong thing.
[10:56:36] <BillCriswell> greek, brooklyn
[10:56:41] <BillCriswell> don't see deep dish too often.
[10:56:55] <paulvd> true dutch, i told them to just copy paste this code too, they not ok with that too :/
[10:56:56] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell i feel like there's be a style specific to philly.
[10:57:30] <paulvd> hmm wordpress shortcode sounds good but
[10:57:50] <duch_kazatel> paulvd *duch, and i've been there before.  sometimes you have to put in the extra work up front to prevent the pissed call later.
[10:59:30] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Nothing is coming to mind.
[10:59:47] <BillCriswell> I like thin, crispy crust. I think that's brooklyn style
[10:59:48] <BillCriswell> ?
[10:59:52] <duch_kazatel> yeah NY style.
[10:59:54] <duch_kazatel> weird.
[11:05:56] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Apparently tomato pies are a Philly thing?
[11:05:59] <BillCriswell> Reading: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_in_the_United_States
[11:06:12] <antlong> never heard of a tomato pie
[11:06:13] <BillCriswell> I'm not a fan of it, though.
[11:06:14] <antlong> thankfully
[11:06:25] <antlong> wait you mean a pizza? or a pie made of tomatos?
[11:06:26] <BillCriswell> antlong: Yeah, I don't get it.
[11:06:35] <BillCriswell> antlong: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato_pie
[11:06:44] <antlong> oh those are amazing
[11:06:50] <BillCriswell> "In Philadelphia, it is usually served at room temperature in rectangular sheets with little to no cheese."
[11:06:52] <BillCriswell> What?
[11:06:55] <antlong> yeah man
[11:07:02] <antlong> i live in nyc, and they are absolutely incredible
[11:07:30] <antlong> let me link you the best in nyc: https://www.google.com/search?q=spumoni+gardens&num=100&newwindow=1&safe=off&client=firefox-beta&hs=jwS&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&channel=sb&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=2siIU96zFq7isATc3IH4Dw&ved=0CAkQ_AUoAg&biw=1428&bih=803
[11:07:34] <antlong> take a look, its delicious
[11:08:11] <BillCriswell> If the cheese is under it I might be able to deal with it, but no cheese no thanks.
[11:08:34] <antlong> no cheese, just parmesan
[11:08:46] <antlong> you don't need mozzarella though, the sauce is sweet and slightly chunky
[11:08:57] <antlong> where you from BillCriswell ?
[11:09:05] <BillCriswell> Philly.
[11:09:24] <antlong> oh ok
[11:09:34] <BillCriswell> Pica's is really good, they put the cheese under the sauce.
[11:09:35] <BillCriswell> https://www.google.com/search?q=pica%27s+pizza&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=GcmIU52nF5WksQSmwICIAw&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg&biw=1156&bih=516
[11:09:37] <antlong> i went up there once, it was nice.
[11:09:50] <antlong> saw crackhead panhandlers get chased away from geno's by the staff
[11:09:51] <BillCriswell> Yeah, it has its moments haha.
[11:09:52] <antlong> that was fun
[11:10:05] <BillCriswell> Yeah, people at Geno's are pretty scary.
[11:10:27] <BillCriswell> "Order in English ONLY" signs and shit, doesn't feel very welcoming.
[11:10:57] <BillCriswell> http://cdn.phillymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ventobig.jpg here ya go, yuck.
[11:11:36] <antlong> yeah he's a psycho
[11:12:56] <DrNaeluh> good moring ! Hi Everybody !
[11:13:09] <BillCriswell> Damn dude you're a Dr. now.
[11:13:32] <DrNaeluh> I got a ph D
[11:13:40] <DrNaeluh> :D
[11:14:16] <DrNaeluh> I am ready to operate

[11:15:19] <BillCriswell> Everything about this game cracks me up.
[11:15:37] <DrNaeluh> BillCriswell: I have that game
[11:15:46] <DrNaeluh> those simulators are awesome
[11:15:48] <BillCriswell> It seems impossible.
[11:16:00] <BillCriswell> Well... extremely difficult.
[11:16:33] <DrNaeluh> you every seen this and plus its robbaz http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3YyOMqqMDg
[11:17:01] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I remeber the trailer for that beeing beautiful .
[11:17:18] <antlong> duch_kazatel did you have any ideas on other things to incorporate?
[11:17:21] <BillCriswell> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvWGLcdI8o8 ah, so good.
[11:18:52] <duch_kazatel> sorry was away.
[11:19:08] <duch_kazatel> antlong what's up?
[11:19:15] <duch_kazatel> other things to incorporate to what?
[11:19:16] <DrNaeluh> its almost like it  was not real
[11:19:22] <antlong> duch_kazatel to add to the site to make it look nicer
[11:19:36] <duch_kazatel> what site?
[11:19:51] <antlong> www.multiverseminer.com
[11:19:56] <antlong> you suggested powertip earlier
[11:20:02] <antlong> which I'm working on, its very nice looking
[11:20:19] <duch_kazatel> oh you were asking about modals/tooltips.  that's my go-to for tooltips.
[11:20:22] <duch_kazatel> you mean general ideas?
[11:20:55] <antlong> yes
[11:21:03] <antlong> trying to make the ui and ux a little better
[11:24:26] <MikeD_> does tooltip() have a delegated notion?
[11:28:22] <duch_kazatel> antlong debounce keyboard events - bind to keydown instead.  i can just press and hold things to gather/save/whatever.
[11:28:40] <goooogleee>  im still trying to figure our how to put this on just one specific wordpress page
[11:28:46] <goooogleee>  im still trying to figure our how to put this on just one specific wordpress page https://github.com/gristmill/jquery-popbox *
[11:28:54] <goooogleee> any clues
[11:29:03] <antlong> duch_kazatel we will change that when we launch, for now it makes testing easier haha
[11:29:11] <duch_kazatel> antlong i'd also hde things away in menus.
[11:29:25] <antlong> duch_kazatel like the panels on the left and right?
[11:29:38] <MikeD_> how do i count the number of items that matched a selector?
[11:29:40] <duch_kazatel> on second thought, what's the planet for?
[11:29:47] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ the .length property.
[11:30:14] <MikeD_> thanks
[11:31:51] <duch_kazatel> antlong the visual of the planet doesn't seem like it should be front and center imo.
[11:31:56] <goooogleee> i know where to place the html of course but my issue is where to place the css and js  https://github.com/gristmill/jquery-popbox
[11:32:09] <duch_kazatel> goooogleee stop relinking that pls.
[11:32:12] <duch_kazatel> we're not blind.
[11:32:21] <antlong> duch_kazatel no it probably shouldnt
[11:32:22] <duch_kazatel> but the css and js wherever you put everything else.
[11:32:31] <duch_kazatel> include a ref on the pages that need them.
[11:32:35] <antlong> i don't know what we're going to put there yet
[11:32:53] <duch_kazatel> antlong actionable stuff. or move the action buttons over that overlay some way.
[11:33:04] <duch_kazatel> i'm not a game designer so i'm not the best person to ask.
[11:33:26] <goooogleee> Sorry about that my appologies well i put the html on the actual page as it should be but how can i reference
[11:33:44] <duch_kazatel> goooogleee dunno that's a question for a room about wordpress.
[11:34:09] <goooogleee> lol they all sent me here :(
[11:34:23] <duch_kazatel> goooogleee how are other JS/css files included?
[11:34:43] <MikeD_> it's probably all in the theme
[11:35:04] <xingped> How do I do a combination selection? i.e. how do I select the <tr> element with name="trname" under the <td> element with id="tdid"?
[11:35:22] <BillCriswell> Do you guys think it's a pretty common convention that a red * means required?
[11:35:31] <duch_kazatel> and they probably sent you here because your question wasn't formulated very well, goooogleee
[11:35:34] <xingped> BillCriswell, yeah, i'd say that's common enough
[11:35:44] <goooogleee> duch_kazatel ,i uploaded the js and css files to my host wp-content/themes/campus
[11:35:45] <duch_kazatel> ask them "how do I include js/css on only a specific page?
[11:35:49] <MikeD_> BillCriswell: yeah, but it's still not a great convention
[11:35:58] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: xingped: Agreed.
[11:35:59] <duch_kazatel> goooogleee that doesn't make any sense to me imo - i don't know anything about wordpress.
[11:36:05] <xingped> MikeD_, why not? it seems to be used everywhere like that
[11:36:09] <duch_kazatel> xingped the same way you'd select using CSS.
[11:36:30] <xingped> duch_kazatel, sorry, i'm not following...
[11:36:32] <duch_kazatel> $('#tdid tr[name="trname"]')
[11:36:54] <xingped> duch_kazatel, ah okay, thanks!
[11:36:59] <MikeD_> just because 'everyone does it' doesn't mean it's understood without some kind of explanation
[11:37:08] <duch_kazatel> i'd avoid using attribute selectors though, xingped
[11:37:16] <duch_kazatel> give those things a class instead.
[11:37:25] <MikeD_> if you're not already familiar with *=required, it's just an ugly bit of cruft on the page
[11:37:27] <xingped> duch_kazatel, in my use case, i think i'll be fine. why though?
[11:37:40] <duch_kazatel> xingped they're slow.
[11:38:09] <duch_kazatel> there are built-in ways to select IDs and Classes, because that's partially why they're there.  the name attribute is a piece of data that isn't meant to be selected on.
[11:38:17] <BillCriswell> Would that selector since #tdid then look for the tr[]s or the opposite?
[11:38:20] <duch_kazatel> so it's also a syntactic thing.
[11:38:36] <BillCriswell> s/since/find*
[11:38:38] <xingped> duch_kazatel, ah okay. that's not really a concern in my current case, but it's good to know for the future.
[11:38:42] <BillCriswell> no idea how I typed that.
[11:38:55] <duch_kazatel> xingped it should be a concern, and how do you have a TR inside of a TD?
[11:38:57] <duch_kazatel> nested tabled?
[11:39:03] <duch_kazatel> *tables
[11:39:36] <xingped> duch_kazatel, you've got it backwards, i have a <td> in a <tr>
[11:39:53] <duch_kazatel> "how do I select the <tr> element with name="trname" under the <td> element with id="tdid"?"
[11:39:55] <duch_kazatel> that's what you asked.
[11:40:03] <xingped> oh wait
[11:40:06] <xingped> i've got it backwards
[11:40:06] <duch_kazatel> "how do i get the tr under the td"
[11:40:07] <xingped> hahaha
[11:40:09] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[11:40:16] <xingped> well, i meant it the other way around
[11:40:50] <Kambfhase> duch_kazatel: #td tr[name="trname"]
[11:41:07] <duch_kazatel> Kambfhase i was answering the question they posed exactly as they asked it ;)
[11:41:08] <Kambfhase> duch_kazatel: $('#tdid tr[name="trname"]')
[11:41:09] <xingped> ^ hahahaha
[11:41:22] <Kambfhase> oh, sorry.
[11:41:25] <duch_kazatel> and i all ready have that answer...

[11:48:22] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:48:58] <duch_kazatel> you mean ajaxStart()?

[12:09:44] <Bloomberg> I have tested some ways but nothing!
[12:11:01] <BillCriswell> This is such a good read: https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook

[12:11:32] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/2Wf7m/
[12:11:37] <Bloomberg> with this
[12:12:06] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg does the request actually complete?
[12:12:26] <Bloomberg> yes
[12:12:37] <Bloomberg> the ajaxStart is working now
[12:13:28] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: What's the issue with this?
[12:13:44] <Bloomberg> the complete not works
[12:14:01] <duch_kazatel> does your network panel show it completing successfully?
[12:14:07] <Bloomberg> ajaxComplete show like complete task
[12:14:10] <BillCriswell> Are you sure it doesn't work or are you assuming because you don't see an li added?
[12:14:20] <Bloomberg> I don't know why chrome console is like bad
[12:14:47] <Bloomberg> I would prefere the mozilla condsole, but the latest update of mozilla is wrong
[12:14:50] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Do $('#files').hide() and $('#files').append('<li>Whatever</li>').show();
[12:15:07] <Bloomberg> show me undefined is not a function
[12:15:07] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Yeah, they have *no* idea what they're doing obviously.

[12:16:22] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell : neither works your line

[12:17:12] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/2Wf7m/2/ even more obviously working.
[12:18:01] <duch_kazatel> this is going to sound strange - anybody know of a way to purposefully a ton of errors in JS?
[12:18:22] <PerlWebDev> ?
[12:18:46] <duch_kazatel> our error reporting system dropped for no reason, so we're going to try generating some junk errors to report.
[12:18:57] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Bunch of bad http requests?
[12:18:57] <duch_kazatel> a handful isn't enough - i need a good amount.
[12:19:35] <PerlWebDev> paste a ton of bad code into a browser debug console and run it
[12:19:48] <duch_kazatel> but that'll generate a single error...
[12:19:51] <duch_kazatel> and BillCriswell oooohhh.
[12:19:53] <duch_kazatel> that might work.
[12:20:20] <BillCriswell> setInterval and get an error like an unexpected string or something?
[12:20:23] <BillCriswell> I'm not sure.
[12:20:26] <duch_kazatel> even better.
[12:20:27] <duch_kazatel> ty
[12:21:33] <duch_kazatel> perfection.
[12:21:38] <BillCriswell> Sweeeeeet.
[12:22:46] <PerlWebDev> odd issue. Page is generated with two text fields. Neither has a predefined ID. The datepicker is attached to them via the class for the fields. Occasionally this attaches the same ID to each field, so data can't be entered for both fields as each calendar fills in data in the first field only. Refreshing the window makes it go away, most times. jQuery 1.9.1, jQuery-ui 1.10.4

[12:34:58] <jeko23> the script is still running and using a bunch of memory
[12:35:09] <jeko23> so I Would just like to end a function in the script when the page isn't active
[12:35:28] <PerlWebDev> and leave the page/data in an unknown state?
[12:35:48] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell : no yet
[12:37:42] <jeko23> @perlwebdev not sure what you mean by unknown state, i just want have a JS script that is animating an element.  When the user leaves the tab/page I would like to stop the animation

[14:31:39] <antlong> has anyone used powertip with grunt?

[14:33:20] <Agamemnus> thank you
[14:37:06] <SloggerKhan> Hmm. Maybe my selector is wrong.
[16:09:57] <silverdust> usually, I use $('.class').click(function(){}); but a friend said it's better to use $(document).on('click','.class',function(){});

[17:40:44] <j-queer> I am trying to implement an infinite scroll - where on the home page of my site, all items from the db are shown, but only a few of them load at once. I know how to make an ajax call when the scrollbar gets to the bottom, but should the ajax call load the next page as a url? then get the next page's content in that div and load it? or is there a way to just not load the entire index yet, then load more and more as the bottom is reach

[20:38:15] <antlong> want to discuss query?
[20:38:18] <antlong> jquery*
[20:38:51] <antlong> i actually have an issue
[20:39:03] <antlong> i don't know if its grunt or jquery or me
[20:39:20] <BillCriswell> What's the issue?
[20:40:00] <antlong> i am trying to install powertip, and i was getting $ is undefined
[20:40:13] <antlong> then i wrapped it in a jQuery() function and jQuery was undefined
[20:40:20] <antlong> but there is jquery on the page afaik
[20:40:52] <BillCriswell> antlong: Are you loading jQuery before you include the plugin?
[20:41:06] <antlong> no in grunt jquery is before the plugin
[20:41:42] <BillCriswell> What is grunt doing to your files?
[20:42:45] <antlong> let's see
[20:43:42] <BillCriswell> antlong: I mean bottom line from the front-end perspective you need to include jquery, then the plugin, then you use the plugin.
[20:44:40] <antlong> https://github.com/antlong/multiverseminer/blob/master/Gruntfile.js
[20:45:57] <antlong> so i don't even see powertip referenced in the concat'd js
[20:47:00] <antlong> perhaps I'm importing it incorrectly
[21:00:07] <BillCriswell> antlong: Yeah not seeing it in the output.
[21:00:59] <antlong> BillCriswell do i need to include it anywhere else?
[21:01:18] <antlong> BillCriswell i just verified that running with -v doesn't show anything about powertip (the js file)
[22:35:23] <SimbaLion> Can someone help me? I'm trying to use this: https://github.com/steverydz/simpleGal I've got a test installed at http://wip.pridetechdesign.com/ but it doesn't seem to be working right..
[22:40:34] <antlong> SimbaLion something is off with the links
[22:40:49] <antlong> if you mouse over the image thumb, its a .jpg link
[22:41:53] <antlong> SimbaLion did you call the simpleGal() function on your main div?
[22:41:55] <SimbaLion> what's off about that?
[22:42:11] <antlong> nothing, it just looked fishy but thats right apparently
[22:42:38] <SimbaLion> what do you mean on the main div? I called it in the <head> section, I basically copied the code from http://steverydz.github.io/simpleGal/demo/
[22:43:16] <antlong> https://github.com/steverydz/simpleGal
[22:43:18] <SimbaLion> oh hey, the demo doesn't call it in the head, it calls it afterward, let me try that
[22:43:22] <antlong> SimbaLion scroll down
[22:43:56] <antlong> i get the feeling you're not actually calling the function
[22:43:58] <antlong> but i didn't verify
[22:44:07] <SimbaLion> I am
[22:44:52] <SimbaLion> and I tried putting it in the footer instead of the header but that didn't fix it
[22:46:06] <antlong> taking a look
[22:46:39] <SimbaLion> I appreciate your help, I've been at this for an hour or so and it's got me stumped
[22:46:58] <SimbaLion> I still need to write some sort of widget to simplify posting images and thumbnails too
[22:47:22] <SimbaLion> this jquery is the simplest part heh
[22:48:15] <SimbaLion> does devtools provide a way to see if functions are being called?
[22:50:37] <antlong> profile
[22:54:42] <antlong> SimbaLion im a little stumped so far
[22:54:44] <antlong> still looking though
[22:54:57] <SimbaLion> Yeah I tested it using breakpoints and it seems to be calling the function
[22:55:13] <antlong> yup
[22:56:03] <SimbaLion> could it be something in the js itself? var thumbnail = $(this).find("a"), perhaps? Since that's what tells it to find the thumbnails
[22:56:38] <SimbaLion> wait no, cause the next part is preventDefault which is working, when I click the images don't open
[22:56:48] <antlong> i mean
[22:56:58] <antlong> what is .custom?
[22:57:06] <antlong> idont see any div named custom
[22:57:40] <SimbaLion> custom is the class for the placeholder image, which is inside the main-image div
[22:58:02] <SimbaLion> That's how the demo is coded http://steverydz.github.io/simpleGal/demo/
[22:58:10] <SimbaLion> view-source:http://steverydz.github.io/simpleGal/demo/
[22:58:46] <SimbaLion> it isn't necessary, but since it wasn't working I added it so I could copy the demo's code verbatim
[23:00:16] <antlong> man i don't even know
[23:03:13] <SimbaLion> wait something else is broken, I removed the script from the header, and the thumbnails are not linking to the images, even tho they're wrapped in anchor tags
[23:03:22] <SimbaLion> but I dunno why
[23:05:19] <SimbaLion> well this is bizarre, I put the thumbnails in the post with the placeholder, and now they are working the way it's supposed to, except the script isn't being called.
[23:05:52] <SimbaLion> oops yes it was, my mistake
[23:05:57] <antlong> did you remove it from head
[23:06:12] <SimbaLion> yeah I had it somewhere else I'd forgotten about
[23:07:07] <SimbaLion> okay, I think I have to call the script somewhere else to make the thumbnails work from within the sidebar widget
[23:11:34] <SimbaLion> It seems like the thumbnails have to be within the same container as the placeholder
[23:11:44] <SimbaLion> which defeats the whole purpose
[23:23:03] <antlong> SimbaLion placeholder is just the default image, no?
[23:23:19] <SimbaLion> right
[23:24:10] <antlong> its a weird plugin
[23:24:11] <antlong> lol
[23:24:15] <antlong> i don't like it at all
[23:26:31] <SimbaLion> is it a limit of .find() maybe?
[23:26:42] <duch_kazatel> what's going on?
[23:27:32] <SimbaLion> I'm trying to adapt https://github.com/steverydz/simpleGal to create a gallery where the thumbnails are in the sidebar, but the jquery breaks if the thumbnails aren't in the same container as the placeholder image
[23:28:04] <duch_kazatel> why not use another gallery then?
[23:28:40] <SimbaLion> well I haven't looked at any others yet
[23:29:01] <duch_kazatel> i generally reccommend people don't try to "adapt" things, y'know?
[23:29:17] <SimbaLion> Why not? That's what programming is about
[23:29:39] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[23:29:43] <SimbaLion> everything I've learned about coding in every language I know, I've learned by modifying examples
[23:29:50] <duch_kazatel> i mean, you could fork the plugin and rewrite it.
[23:29:54] <duch_kazatel> *rewrite the parts you need.
[23:30:06] <sacho_> how does it break?
[23:30:09] <SimbaLion> what'd you think I meant by adapt? heh
[23:30:25] <duch_kazatel> but i still don't usually suggest you do that.
[23:30:36] <SimbaLion> sacho_, I dunno, I'm really new to js and jquery.. that's why I came here for help. preventDefault works, but it doesn't replace the placeholder with the clicked image
[23:31:06] <duch_kazatel> you'll wind up doing a bunch of extra work when you could just use a plugin that works in the first place.  or write your own from scratch.
[23:31:39] <sacho_> SimbaLion, that plugin is tiny
[23:31:45] <SimbaLion> that's why I liked it
[23:32:16] <sacho_> my point is, you could write one
[23:32:33] <duch_kazatel> it'd be a great way to learn js/jquery
[23:32:37] <sacho_> but the part where it looks for the thumbnails is the $(this).find("a") part
[23:32:47] <SimbaLion> right
[23:33:11] <sacho_> you should pass the plugin some options, either a container for the thumbnails/images, or all the thumbnails as a jquery object
[23:33:30] <SimbaLion> " the .find() method allows us to search through the descendants of these elements in the DOM tree and construct a new jQuery object from the matching elements. "
[23:33:43] <sacho_> and rewrite it to use that instead of guessing they're under the element you're applying the plugin on
[23:34:17] <SimbaLion> Because the thumbnails are in a different container div, that means they aren't descendents, no?
[23:34:25] <sacho_> yes
[23:37:14] <duch_kazatel> i appreciate jquery more and more when mucking through this mootools stuff.
[23:37:22] <antlong> heh
[23:37:30] <antlong> haven't heard of mootools in a long while
[23:38:07] <duch_kazatel> we have a lot of legacy code using it.  finally deprecating it out.
[23:39:13] <SimbaLion> $(this).find("a"), could I replace 'this' with something else? like "html", so it'd search the whole page?
[23:39:25] <duch_kazatel> that'll find all "a" tags in the page.
[23:39:28] <duch_kazatel> not good for what you want.
[23:39:52] <SimbaLion> what about $("html").siblings().find(options.mainImage);
[23:40:02] <SimbaLion> so it searches for the placeholder
[23:40:02] <sacho_> you could, but at this point, a more useful learning experience would be learn.jquery.com than trying to rework this plugin
[23:40:11] <sacho_> you should at least know how to select elements you want
[23:40:28] <sacho_> half the useful work jquery does is selection
[23:40:41] <SimbaLion> as I mentioned before, experimenting with code is how I like to learn
[23:40:44] <duch_kazatel> SimbaLion that selector will be extremely inefficient.
[23:40:54] <sacho_> that's why sites like that have code demos
[23:41:02] <duch_kazatel> and learn.jquery.com will give you the necessary boilerplate to get started.
[23:41:02] <SimbaLion> can I give it a class name?
[23:41:12] <duch_kazatel> SimbaLion learn.jquery.com will teach you.
[23:41:17] <duch_kazatel> start with that instead.
[23:42:00] <SimbaLion> I have a basic understanding, I went thru the w3c lessons, but it was awhile ago and I haven't practiced much
[23:42:09] <duch_kazatel> w3c is a terrible site.
[23:42:12] <duch_kazatel> never use it.
[23:42:14] <SimbaLion> not really
[23:42:18] <duch_kazatel> yes really.
[23:42:41] <duch_kazatel> and selectors are one of the basics for jquery - you need to walk before you can crawl.
[23:42:41] <SimbaLion> Look I appreciate your help, but you're being a negative nancy.
[23:42:48] <duch_kazatel> err, crawl before you can walk.
[23:42:49] <duch_kazatel> beer!
[23:42:50] <SimbaLion> I fucking hate negative nancies
[23:42:55] <duch_kazatel> whatever dude.
[23:43:11] <duch_kazatel> you claim that you have the basics down, and then ask questions that you should know.
[23:43:28] <duch_kazatel> learn.jquery.com is a far more accurate resource.
[23:43:32] <duch_kazatel> trust me :)
[23:43:39] <SimbaLion> I'm the friendliest guy in the world, the one thing I can't fucking stand is people who contradict everything, tell you everything you're doing is wrong, tell you "do it this way instead" etc etc. It's bullshit. I don't need it. Nobody needs it. But thank you.
[23:43:57] <Woet> SimbaLion: http://www.w3fools.com/
[23:43:57] <SimbaLion> I think I'll be fine, I have an idea what to do now.
[23:44:03] <duch_kazatel> so you're going to dismiss an expert because you'd rather beat your head against the wall?
[23:44:10] <SimbaLion> experts aren't negative nancies
[23:44:40] <SimbaLion> in drug circles they'd call you a buzzkill, you're the guy who ruins everyone's trip to complain about some bs or another
[23:44:46] <duch_kazatel> i'm not being negative.  i'm trying to show you that there are far superior ways for you to learn, and that w3c is often considered a TERRIBLE resource.
[23:44:49] <SimbaLion> but don't take it personally
[23:45:01] <duch_kazatel> i'm not - your opinion has absolutely no merit.
[23:45:08] <duch_kazatel> because you'd rather be flippant and rude.
[23:45:11] <SimbaLion> Why don't you see what's wrong with your behavior?
[23:45:19] <SimbaLion> anyway, thanks all, cyas
[23:45:25] <duch_kazatel> wow.
[23:45:29] <duch_kazatel> thank god he left.
[23:45:36] <duch_kazatel> i almost cared.
[23:45:57] <duch_kazatel> how's everybody else doing tonight
