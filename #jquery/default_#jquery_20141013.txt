[01:05:22] <greenshirt> hello
[01:13:52] <Koopz> aight... and again i'm kinda confused...
[01:14:00] <Koopz> anyone working with DataTables and Ajax?
[01:15:17] <ivanci> sorry
[01:15:38] <Koopz> the example on their website shows a JSON-String while my request returns a JSON-Array containing objects...
[01:16:45] <Koopz> guess i'll tinker a bit on the PHP side...
[01:17:26] <Kartagis> how can I have dynamic image loading based on the page I'm on?
[01:17:57] <Cork> Kartagis: based on the page your on?
[01:18:18] <Cork> and where?
[01:18:20] <Koopz> i'd check window.location but there might be cooler solutions
[01:18:38] <Kartagis> Cork: when I hover on this sentence, show the related image
[01:18:56] <Kartagis> Cork: the image that belongs to this content*
[01:19:00] <Cork> Kartagis: have the content send the url as part of the data
[01:19:09] <Cork> and just generically show the url
[01:19:26] <Cork> <p data-img="/image/pic.png">something</p>
[01:21:09] <Kartagis> Koopz: were you telling me?
[01:21:42] <Koopz> yep but i had something different on my mind
[01:27:18] <greenshirt> i'm using jquery number to format input to currency format.... its work, but when i want to save it to database again,  its not work, ... the input value contains literal from formated input..how i can revert it back again to regular number ?
[01:28:35] <FilipNortic> greenshirt: why do you want to do this client side?
[01:30:07] <greenshirt> FilipNortic: its just for display and readable input ... i'm trying to input currency format, .. so i think its nice i can saw the right number inputed
[01:36:14] <FilipNortic> greenshirt: well your data is ussally sent back to your server as either String litterals or json and then you edit it server side before save. or are you having some trubble with special chars or encoding errors?
[02:13:04] <shilon> hey, anyone here ever used masonry?
[02:17:45] <shilon> hey, anyone here ever used masonry? I’m trying to implement the plugin on my website, but I don’t know why nothing is happening.
[02:37:25] <Mark___> does anybody here know how to give pixelated effect on the background image?
[03:41:43] <Cork> Mark___: an option is to use image-rendering
[03:41:53] <Cork> Mark___: but that only works if the image is scaled
[03:44:49] <AldNOY> how could I fetch all the required input fields like this: <input type="text" required="required">?

[04:02:17] <CathaliN> hello
[04:02:35] <CathaliN> can someone help me with putting a json array into a treeview?
[04:04:00] <CathaliN> here is my json: http://jsfiddle.net/ewcLc95r/
[04:04:19] <CathaliN> "colectie" is the parent and "articol" is the child
[04:04:34] <CathaliN> how to create a tree from that?
[04:07:03] <uskerine> hi, I would like this to react for both items with class .actionFoo and .actionBar, is separating .actionBar .actionFoo with a space correct?         myTable.on('click','.actionFoo .actionBar',function() {
[04:07:25] <Cork> uskerine: comma
[04:07:33] <Cork> space is a sibling selector
[04:07:33] <uskerine> thanks Cork
[04:07:40] <Cork> sorry
[04:07:42] <Cork> child not sibling
[04:07:47] <uskerine> understood
[04:07:51] <uskerine> like in CSS
[04:08:01] <Cork> uskerine: it is css selecors :)
[04:08:04] <Cork> not like
[04:08:36] <jonkristian> Has anyone ever seen length validation control used on multiple textareas? For instance you are allowed 1000 characters, you can put 700 in one textarea and then be left with 300 for the rest.
[04:09:08] <uskerine> :)
[04:09:36] <Cork> jonkristian: no, can't say i can even figure a situation where it would be needed
[04:09:56] <jeffreylevesque> can i programmatically create a click event on an element?
[04:10:22] <jeffreylevesque> ahh, 'trigger()'
[04:10:24] <jeffreylevesque> coolio
[04:11:09] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: note that trigger won't trigger the browsers default action
[04:11:26] <Kingsy> what is the meaning of a selector such as --> $('ul', $(this).find("h4")) <-- what is the commer seperator in the middle doing?
[04:11:29] <Cork> or rather in some cases
[04:11:57] <Cork> Kingsy:  $('ul', $(this).find("h4")) ==  $(this).find("h4 ul")
[04:12:01] <RiZKiT> Kingsy: comma seperated selectors ... there u have two selectors at once
[04:12:06] <Cork> or $(this).find("h4").find(ul)
[04:12:10] <Cork> opps
[04:12:13] <Cork> or $(this).find("h4").find('ul')
[04:12:22] <Kingsy> ah I see
[04:12:24] <Kingsy> oops of course
[04:12:26] <Kingsy> DOH
[04:12:42] <RiZKiT> so i was wrong
[04:12:42] <jonkristian> Cork, it's a special situation. I am generating a pdf and i need to control the length of collective text.
[04:13:34] <Cork> jonkristian: you could do something like $.map($('textarea'), function(elm) { return $(this).val(); }).join('').length
[04:14:39] <jonkristian> Cork, sweet, I'll try something like that:)
[04:14:43] <thor77> hi, i have a table with a few rows and columns, if i click on a column, it should fade out, how can i do that?
[04:15:11] <thor77> is this only possible with one id per column?
[04:15:39] <RiZKiT> thor77: if you just want to fade it out you dont need any ids
[04:15:53] <Cork> thor77: $('table').on('click', 'td', function() { $(this).fadeOut('slow'); });
[04:16:19] <thor77> that looks good, thank you
[04:16:38] <yaro_> Hi guys, I am trying to build simple script which will detect which section is currently display, its one page website with multiple sections and when users scroll to the section I want to highlight the menu
[04:16:38] <Cork> you most likely want to have a remove there too
[04:16:47] <yaro_> how should I do that with custom jquery script?
[04:17:28] <Cork> yaro_: you would have to collect the position().top for the different sections
[04:17:40] <RiZKiT> yaro_: there are alot of already good solutions for that, you can do it by urself if u want the challenge ...
[04:17:46] <Cork> and then compare it to the scrollTop/scrollY value
[04:18:39] <yaro_> I can get scrollTop value with $(window).scrollTop?
[04:18:45] <yaro_> ()*
[04:18:55] <Cork> yaro_: yes
[04:19:16] <thor77> Cork> if i click the td it disappears completetly... is it possible to insert a placeholder instead?
[04:19:38] <Cork> thor77: then you would have to have an additional tr
[04:19:55] <thor77> or a div inside the td?
[04:20:07] <Cork> if you replace td yes
[04:20:15] <Cork> meaning if you don't fadeout the row
[04:20:19] <Cork> a div would work
[04:21:16] <PrimalHunter> Hi, is there a selector that supports regex for jquery selection? I currently have a set of selected elements and would like to remove some of them, a regex might be useful here.
[04:22:03] <Cork> PrimalHunter: $('selector').filter(function() { /* run complex filtering here */ })
[04:22:15] <PrimalHunter> Ha filter, thanks. :)
[04:22:27] <Cork> but it filters, so make sure to make the selector match as little as possible
[04:23:19] <Omar-> PrimalHunter something like this http://stackoverflow.com/a/25582482/1771795
[04:23:58] <yaro_> there is one problem with the scrollTop(), it is not "recording" every value, it goes something like this 3,15,26,34 etc
[04:24:14] <yaro_> how can I compare the offset and the scrollTop then?
[04:24:23] <Cork> yaro_: the event is fired lazily
[04:24:33] <Cork> you can't really do much about that
[04:24:55] <Cork> yaro_: so you need to check something like the top + height of the target
[04:25:07] <PrimalHunter> Sure. I'm trying to do something like "select all elements that have myClass but NOT otherClass_[0-2]". :)
[04:25:08] <Cork> and as long as it is within assume it is there
[04:25:16] <PrimalHunter> I'll have a look Omar- and play around with filter.
[04:25:43] <Cork> PrimalHunter: ah, you should add collection classes instead
[04:26:00] <Cork> meaning otherClass_0 also has otherClass
[04:26:17] <Cork> then you just do $('.myClass:not(.otherClass)')
[04:26:17] <yaro_> Cork: Thanks, I will try that
[04:26:59] <PrimalHunter> Now that you mention it, it might actually be possible to sneak it in.
[04:27:31] <Cork> PrimalHunter: when you need to use regex or partial search in classes
[04:27:40] <Cork> it normally mean you should split the class
[04:32:31] <PrimalHunter> Thanks Cork, I'll try to remember it. It's someone else's code so it's a bit hard to figure out how he came up with some constructs.
[04:33:08] <Cork> PrimalHunter: ya, it showed :)
[04:34:26] <Ansikt> Hey, is it possible to reject a $.ajax() call?
[04:34:42] <Cork> Ansikt: var xhr = $.ajax(); xhr.abort()
[04:35:01] <Ansikt> Cork: You're a rad dude.
[04:35:13] <Ansikt> Google said it couldn't be done.  But I said "Cork will know!" and I was right.
[04:36:19] <thor77> Cork> it looks like your solution doesnt work, my code: http://jsfiddle.net/c1n766r9/1/
[04:36:45] <yaro_> guys, one more question, why am I getting a warrning that if I use $.ajax and async parameter that async is being deprecated? with the jquery 1.11.1
[04:37:05] <yaro_> I am using regular $.ajax method, nothing fancy
[04:37:41] <decx> use the console thor77 it tells you exactly what's wrong
[04:38:52] <thor77> decx> the console doesnt say anything
[04:39:27] <decx> maybe turn it on
[04:40:04] <Cork> thor77: what part isn't working? 12:47
[04:40:06] <Cork> opps
[04:40:12] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/c1n766r9/2/
[04:40:24] <Cork> i hate it when the clipboard copies random string -_-'
[04:41:28] <thor77> Cork> if i click on "some text" it hides, but how can i show it again now?
[04:41:43] <Cork> thor77: fadeToggle?
[04:42:03] <thor77> still doesnt work
[04:49:08] <thor77> Cork> the fade out works fine, but i cant fade in because the div is away
[04:50:14] <Cork> thor77: bind the click to the tr
[04:50:24] <Cork> and do $(this).children('div').fade

[05:06:35] <frank_o> Hi! Is it possible to do a setTimeout that stops whatever comes after it until it's done -- without actually having to put the code inside it?
[05:07:02] <Cork> frank_o: if you stop the code it would mean freezing the page completely
[05:07:07] <Cork> frank_o: js is single threaded
[05:07:13] <frank_o> ah I see
[05:07:18] <Cork> and js blocks the browser from updating
[05:07:27] <Cork> so you never want the js to block :)
[05:07:44] <frank_o> no blockage!! ever
[05:12:07] <Audiosurfer> anyone here mind helping me with a jquery issue?
[05:12:37] <Cork> ?ask @ Audiosurfer
[05:12:37] <b-ot> Audiosurfer: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:12:49] <Audiosurfer> oh, sorry
[05:13:46] <Audiosurfer> well i'm trying to get the html associated with a certain class, but after i checked, the variable remains undefined
[05:14:08] <Audiosurfer> var choice = $('.quizopt').find('.selected').html();
[05:14:36] <Cork> ?paste
[05:14:36] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:14:43] <Cork> include the html structure and js
[05:19:10] <RiskyShenanigan> Hi, having a issue with fancybox where I want a gallery image to appear full size on desktop but till scale for mobile. There is a setting for fitToView which is default to true, when false the image is full size, but does not scale on mobile
[05:19:40] <Audiosurfer> http://jsfiddle.net/6bd52ryu/
[05:21:37] <Cork> Audiosurfer: ah
[05:21:49] <Cork> you want the element when you run .html?
[05:22:12] <Audiosurfer> yeah, so i can see if the choice that the user chose is the correct one
[05:22:25] <Audiosurfer> so im trying to find the one with the selected class and get its html
[05:22:36] <Cork> Audiosurfer: .html() is the same as .innerHTML in normal dom
[05:22:41] <Cork> so it just returns the content of the element
[05:22:45] <Cork> not the element it self
[05:23:01] <Audiosurfer> oh, ok
[05:23:30] <Ansikt> You could just use .eq() or .get()
[05:23:34] <Cork> Audiosurfer: .prop('outerHTML') should give you what you want though
[05:23:46] <Cork> Ansikt: no, that isn't the same at all
[05:24:16] <Ansikt> I must have misread. I thought he wanted the node.
[05:24:33] <Cork> Ansikt: he wants the html form of the element
[05:25:11] <Audiosurfer> hmm, it's still alerting choice as undefined
[05:25:34] <Audiosurfer> after i replaced .html with .prop('outerHTML')
[05:25:46] <Cork> Audiosurfer: looking closer
[05:26:10] <Cork> what you want is to do .attr('src') == questionList[qcount]
[05:26:45] <Audiosurfer> ok
[05:26:47] <Cork> Audiosurfer: also check that $('.quizopt .selected').length returns > 0
[05:26:53] <Cork> (no need for the extra find)
[05:27:26] <Audiosurfer> oh, that makes sense
[05:27:33] <Audiosurfer> thanks for the help :)
[05:27:37] <Audiosurfer> hopefully this works now
[05:38:16] <fonko> guys is it possible to style a common div like a jqm button?
[05:40:06] <Cork> fonko: sure
[05:40:52] <Cork> fonko: you might need to add an extra child wrapper though
[05:41:02] <Cork> but just inspect a button and add the same classes to your div
[05:41:38] <fonko> ok, but what do you mean by adding an extra child wrapper?
[05:41:58] <Cork> <div><span>content</span></div>
[05:42:18] <Cork> i don't know jqm, but that is what you normally do sometimes
[05:43:04] <fonko> great, i will try thanks sr!
[05:46:43] <thor77> how has the html-code to look like for this to work? http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/ajax-and-forms/#client-side-validation
[05:48:41] <Cork> thor77: how has the?
[05:48:47] <Cork> you mean how it would look like?
[05:48:54] <thor77> yes
[05:49:01] <thor77> (sry my english is very bad)
[05:50:45] <fonko> Cork, it worked! thanks sr
[05:51:20] <Elirips> Has anyone ever experienced the following problem: You use $.ajax with the option 'cache: false'. Now two chrome tabs send the same request at exactly the same time. So the _?=timestamp that is added from jquery is the same in both tabs. I have the feeling that the browser sends only one request and tries to read one from cache? Is that possible?
[05:52:10] <Elirips> Or is anything know about $.ajax, cache: false and a browser sending two requests at exactly the same time and one request runs into a timeout?
[05:52:44] <Cork> Elirips: that would be possible yes
[05:53:07] <Cork> though the likelyhood of both fitting into the same second is very low
[05:53:28] <Elirips> Cork: It happens, I run a test with 6 tabs open for 4 days now and it happened exactly once
[05:53:49] <Cork> Elirips: if you need to support multiple tabs like that
[05:54:01] <Cork> you might want to switch to using websocket instead
[05:54:06] <Cork> then you don't hit cache at all
[05:54:30] <Elirips> Cork: I would love to use websockets. Unfortunately, we still have to support IE8... yes... I know.. it suckz.. but I cannot change that requirement... :( :(
[05:54:55] <Cork> Elirips: so use websocket with a ajax pull fallback
[05:54:59] <Cork> it is easy enough
[05:56:08] <Cork> the hardest part is actually the backend
[05:56:12] <Cork> the frontend is easy
[05:56:28] <Elirips> Cork: We will probably just wait for some time. We have one customer that is still using Windows XP, but he will update sooner or later, and then we will change everything to WebSockets and require IE10. But until then..
[05:56:46] <Elirips> We already have the backend (theoretically)
[05:58:42] <Cork> Elirips: ya, we made the switch about 1.5 years ago
[05:59:02] <Cork> websocket makes life so much easier :)
[06:01:01] <Mark___> can anyone explain to me why this is not working on my website?
[06:01:02] <Mark___> http://jsfiddle.net/gyL6776e/2/
[06:01:28] <Mark___> ive applied the same code into my webpage : http://lifeto.dothome.co.kr/xe/
[06:01:35] <Mark___> and it’s not working :p
[06:09:41] <Elirips> Cork: Maybe this is OT now: Could you imagine, that chrome gets confused with headers? Before we do the $.ajax, we set some header values, and if Iook at the server log, it seems that the second request arrives after the first one has been answered, but with the header values of the first requst
[06:10:29] <Cork> Elirips: hmm, can't say i've seen taht
[06:10:31] <Cork> *that
[06:13:22] <jeffreylevesque> i'm creating a json object.  When i concatenate string with variable i get "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token + "
[06:13:34] <Elirips> Cork: anyway thx. I need more logs, more logs and even more. Or I could just make the urls unique and hope it never happens again.. but I would prefer to understand the problem..

[06:15:28] <ktosiek> Hi! I'd like to create a new (jQuery UI) dialog in place of an existing one - is this possible?
[06:16:06] <ktosiek> the old one might be hidden under another dialog, so I have to somehow specify it shouldn't be on top
[06:17:11] <Cork> ktosiek: not sure what the question is, but sure you can open multiple dialogs if that is what you mean
[06:17:58] <Devine9> anyone here know of a plugin with similar features to this navigation? http://www.sonyactioncam.ca/example.jpg     I just want to be able to click ont he three product buttons at the top and have the area below change up, and then have left/right slider navigation to cycle through feature images
[06:19:03] <ktosiek> for example: I have dialog for a running task, another to ask user if he's sure he wants to stop that task. Now I want to change the first one into another - saying "task is complete" - without touching the top dialog
[06:20:34] <jaccob> Anyone can help me use uglifyjs? https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS I cloned it. Then tried $./uglifyjs myjsfile.js but I got errors.
[06:35:53] <ktosiek> so, is it possible to create a modal dialog under another modal dialog?
[06:46:34] <mdev> I have results that come as [{"count(*)":0}]
[06:46:38] <mdev> how can I get access to that
[06:46:47] <mdev> using $.parseJSON(idata);
[06:46:50] <mdev> but I mean the object
[06:51:43] <mdev> nevermind
[06:52:40] <mdev> too complicated for you guys I take it
[06:52:43] <mdev> i'll figure it out
[06:54:08] <BillCriswell> lol.
[06:54:23] <BillCriswell> mdev: obj["count(*)"]
[06:54:48] <BillCriswell> Well, arr[0]["count(*)"]
[06:54:53] <mdev> Thanks bill
[06:55:04] <mdev> i'd upvote you if I could
[06:55:06] <BillCriswell> Really going to take a cheap shot at 756 people though?
[06:55:14] <mdev> !tip BillCriswell 500
[06:55:28] <mdev> err bot not in here, i'll do in private
[06:55:50] <mdev> Bill well, it got someone to answer
[06:56:10] <mdev> One of the best ways to get help, tell a geek they can't do something ;p
[06:56:19] <mdev> no insult intended though
[06:56:28] <BillCriswell> Okie doke.
[06:57:01] <mdev> Also i'd imagine most the 755 in here are bots
[06:57:18] <mdev> highest active count here probably what 50/60 very max?
[06:58:15] <BillCriswell> I think it's mostly people, just people who don't really care to speak too often. Not sure why.
[06:59:28] <mdev> well I know you're active in here a lot so I appreciate it, i'm sure the lurkers do too
[06:59:41] <decx> you dont actually want 750 people to be active
[06:59:53] <BillCriswell> Yeah, that would be a mess haha
[07:00:13] <mdev> haha true, i've seen around 200 active and was completely crazy
[07:00:20] <mdev> just non-stop text
[07:00:25] <BillCriswell> I guess most just have #jquery on autojoin and forget about it.
[07:00:57] <BillCriswell> I'm in a few channels and barely speak in any of them. I just hope to pick up things in passing most the time.
[07:03:04] <mdev> I try and help when i can/be active, some channels are amusing though, anytime I work hours on a bash snipplet and share withe #bash I can always count on them saying how bad my code is :D but to be fair they're just really passionate and typically write a better version

[07:06:59] <Omar-> Stummi thanks, i'll check this out
[07:07:08] <Omar-> because I see many plugins use it
[07:07:09] <mdev> Omar for touchevents probably just best to google the specific thing you're after
[07:07:19] <mdev> i'm sure there's a stackexchange answer out there or similar
[07:07:35] <mdev> I found some for mobile issues I was having with some kind of event, forget what it was
[07:07:40] <Omar-> mdev I've done a research and I have a "pending" question since looooong time
[07:07:54] <mdev> what's the question
[07:08:01] <Omar-> mdev http://stackoverflow.com/q/20789034/1771795
[07:08:23] <Omar-> mdev if you're looking for jQM help, let me know
[07:09:08] <mdev> try e.preventDefault(); before the stopprop
[07:09:42] <mdev> or before the e.stopImmediatePropagation(); rather
[07:10:29] <Omar-> mdev I've tried all possible ways
[07:10:40] <Omar-> I guess it's a "math" issue
[07:11:06] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/dqcYK/
[07:12:41] <MaxSlot> Hi guys need help, I build big app(jquery, html, css, require.js) for studies that app is inject to CMS like joomla and other websites. But have problem with mootools.js, then page is loaded app load only css html onclick load other libraries and parts(open sign and load app parts).
[07:14:17] <Omar-> MaxSlot why are you using MooTools and jQuery?
[07:14:41] <MaxSlot> my app is on jquery and this app inject in all websites who need that app
[07:15:10] <MaxSlot> but some off them have mootools like joomla
[07:16:16] <guy> Is there a way to check if event was ever triggered on an element?
[07:16:40] <mdev> tried your code on mobile Omar seems to work fine for me, left, right up and down although up a few times leads to blank which nothing works after
[07:16:41] <BillCriswell> guy: Not without setting a variable yourself I don't think.
[07:16:53] <guy> Understood.
[07:16:55] <mdev> used chrome and android
[07:16:56] <guy> Thanks.
[07:17:00] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[07:18:37] <R13ose> hi
[07:20:21] <R13ose> How come on the desktop version of this code, the width is too much but on the mobile version this is perfect?  The images are also not taking up 100% of the screen either past as a certain point, maybe because the images are too small and not responsive. Code: http://pastebin.com/YPXUZpTX
[07:23:30] <BillCriswell> Rabbit holes everywhere.
[07:23:40] <Omar-> mdev thanks for trying it. if you move left and move up a bit, it will malfunction
[07:24:12] <BillCriswell> Omar-: I only ever really use touch events with hammer.js
[07:25:02] <BillCriswell> To see which direction I was mostly going I'd just look at the events deltaX/Y.
[07:29:02] <MaxSlot> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26342386/outside-web-aplicationjquery-js-with-mootools-js
[07:30:12] <BillCriswell> MaxSlot: You're going to get down voted like crazy or completely ignore. You'll need to be a lot more specific.
[07:31:14] <MaxSlot> ty for advice
[07:31:20] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[07:36:07] <R13ose> any thoughts on my question?
[07:38:00] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Can you make a demo instead of just the code?
[07:38:15] <R13ose> BillCriswell: I have the website you can see if you want to
[07:39:09] <BillCriswell> That would be a lot more useful than just the code.
[07:40:15] <R13ose> BillCriswell: http://plushinteractive.ca normally there is a black line on the right side in the portfolio section but others I heard from said this is in other sections too.  If you don't see this push the right arrow.
[07:45:50] <BillCriswell> R13ose: The issue, I believe, is the negative margins on the "Visual Identity, Web Design, Mobile Responsive, Development" .row element.
[07:47:30] <BillCriswell> If you uncheck the margin-right of -15px there I don't get that gray bar down the right side when I scroll over a bit.
[07:48:10] <Omar-> BillCriswell I know hammerjs I dont want extra plugins
[07:48:12] <R13ose> BillCriswell: let me try
[07:48:32] <Omar-> I'm trying to make a small img gallery for jQM users
[07:51:49] <R13ose> BillCriswell: I did that, and I still see the black area.  Did you go to the portfolio area and click the right arrow?
[07:52:15] <BillCriswell> R13ose: I'm thinking maybe we were talking about different issues.
[07:52:26] <R13ose> BillCriswell: maybe
[07:52:35] <BillCriswell> Beside if I acrolled to the right I got a long gray border all the way down the page.
[07:52:58] <BillCriswell> before*
[07:53:19] <MaxSlot> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26342386/outside-web-widget-appjquery-js-with-mootools-js
[07:54:24] <KyleSmith> Does anybody know why my alert only shows for my first submit button. I have around 50 submit buttons with the same ID, but with different name/values. I would like it so when I hit submit, it creates an alert, but for some reason, it only works for the first submit button.
[07:55:04] <R13ose> BillCriswell:  Tell me exactly what you are doing?
[07:56:13] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Scrolling to the right in Chrome anywhere on the site.
[07:56:41] <BillCriswell> Two fingers sliding on my Macbook to scroll. There is no horizontal scrollbar, but I can scroll right.
[07:57:13] <Omar-> R13ose i couldn't reproduce the problem on chrome
[07:57:25] <R13ose> BillCriswell: why?
[07:57:45] <R13ose> Omar-: are you in the portfolio section and clicking the right arrow?
[07:58:05] <BillCriswell> Because there's some bigger than the width of the window.
[07:58:23] <Omar-> R13ose no, i'll double check now
[07:59:03] <BillCriswell> R13ose: http://i.imgur.com/opRMj8B.png
[07:59:17] <Omar-> KyleSmith "same ID" this the problem.
[08:00:02] <Omar-> R13ose I get black screen only.
[08:00:23] <KyleSmith> Yes, but is there a way to fix it without having it cause that problem.
[08:00:37] <Omar-> KyleSmith use "class"
[08:00:51] <Omar-> KyleSmith <button class="foo">
[08:01:08] <KyleSmith> great thanks, works.
[08:01:18] <Omar-> np
[08:01:33] <R13ose> BillCriswell: if you look at the class="row" inside id="slide-3" the width is way too big and this has to do with the code I showed you from what I believe is the problem.
[08:01:47] <BillCriswell> KyleSmith: Before it bites you in the ass I imagine you want to listen on the forms submit event and not the button's click event.
[08:02:28] <KyleSmith> yeah, I use the submit event, I just agreed along to button, either way, it worked, thanks
[08:03:06] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[08:03:50] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Slide 2 is causing issues too.
[08:04:55] <BillCriswell> Slide 2 is causing the issue I showed you in the image I posted.
[08:06:32] <R13ose> BillCriswell: Yes but how do I fix the portfolio one?
[08:07:37] <BillCriswell> R13ose: I have o idea what's supposed to be happening there.
[08:07:42] <Omar-> guys you're teasing me
[08:07:43] <Omar-> i
[08:07:58] <Omar-> i'm unable to reproduce the problem
[08:08:00] <Omar-> on chrome
[08:08:22] <R13ose> BillCriswell: I don't want any black on the right side to be shown.
[08:08:32] <BillCriswell> Omar-: Click "Portfolio", click the orange right triangle thing.
[08:09:29] <BillCriswell> R13ose: So just nine images?
[08:09:33] <BlaXpirit> I'm looking for a way to draw attention to a tiny element on a page. Here http://blaxpirit.pythonanywhere.com/projects/swtg/subterranea.html#ent-3-n1-powerup-orb-badge you may or may not notice the green highlight in the center. I would like it to be clearly visible.
[08:09:35] <BillCriswell> 3 by 3, no scrolling?
[08:09:35] <Omar-> BillCriswell I get a black screen to right when slide moves to left
[08:09:36] <BlaXpirit> Ideally, I would like to have a circle shrinking on it, but I don't know where to even start. I could make a rectangle (element with a border), though... position absolute, animate position and size, but that wouldn't look so nice.
[08:10:23] <BlaXpirit> wait a second... I could use border-radius, and the fallback would be rectangular..!
[08:10:41] <R13ose> BillCriswell: yes
[08:11:05] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Are you aware of what's going on here? http://plushinteractive.ca/js/script.js
[08:11:48] <Omar-> BlaXpirit use CSS animation
[08:12:03] <BlaXpirit> Omar-, is that a new CSS feature?
[08:12:47] <BlaXpirit> if so, I will probably avoid it... trying to make it somewhat usable in older browsers
[08:13:07] <R13ose> BillCriswell: yes
[08:13:26] <BillCriswell> So why if you just want them 3 x 3?
[08:14:34] <R13ose> BillCriswell: I only want 3 x 3 on the desktop
[08:16:44] <BillCriswell> R13ose: The "Gallery width" section of your code is adding a lot of hard widths and that container width when it doesn't seem like you actually want it to.
[08:16:52] <Omar-> BlaXpirit IE 8,9 not supported http://caniuse.com/#search=keyframe
[08:17:05] <KyleSmith> Omar- and BillCriswell - I'm trying to grab the "name" of the submit button, but because everyone has the same class, it's only grabbing the name from the first button. Is there a way to grab the data of the button that's been clicked.
[08:17:26] <BillCriswell> KyleSmith: $(this).prop('name')
[08:17:30] <Omar-> KyleSmith add you code in fiddle
[08:17:49] <Omar-> your*
[08:19:58] <MaxSlot> Who can check pls maybe know solution http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26342386/outside-web-widget-appjquery-js-with-mootools-js
[08:20:34] <Omar-> MaxSlot all I can do is an upvote (+1)
[08:20:35] <KyleSmith> Omar- and BillCriswell -
[08:20:36] <KyleSmith> http://pastebin.com/4pbHC8Ma
[08:20:43] <KyleSmith> I tried adding that but it doesn't alert
[08:21:18] <MaxSlot> If it will help to get answer then TY!
[08:21:26] <BillCriswell> Is the name on the dtlbutton or whatever?
[08:22:10] <R13ose> BillCriswell: well fixing this has been my problem.
[08:22:55] <KyleSmith> yes bill: echo "<td><input type=\"submit\" class=\"dtldelete\" name=\"".$new_name."\" value=\"Update Data\" />";
[08:23:02] <KyleSmith> for example
[08:23:04] <KyleSmith> <input type="submit" class="dtldelete" name="BrynJones" value="Update Data">
[08:25:29] <BillCriswell> KyleSmith: http://jsbin.com/lumijoxifegu/1/edit?html,js,output This should work. Adjust this more to what you have.
[08:26:58] <KyleSmith> thank you again
[08:27:55] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[08:36:59] <R13ose> BillCriswell: any thoughts on fixing this?
[08:39:01] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Remove the gallery width section of the javascript.
[08:45:19] <R13ose> BillCriswell: if I do that there is 3x3 on desktop.
[08:45:58] <BillCriswell> You literally said "I only want 3 x 3 on the desktop"
[08:46:35] <BillCriswell> So you can see why I'm so confused.
[08:47:04] <ChrisEarl> Hi all, I have this query $(".mySection").find("a[href*='fr-ca']").length that shows me all links in .mySection with an href that contains "fr-ca", how would I do the same thing to show all links that DO NOT include "fr-ca" please?
[08:48:40] <BillCriswell> ChrisEarl: $('.mySection').find('a').not('[href*="fr-ca"]');
[08:49:27] <ChrisEarl> BillCriswell: Thank you sir, easy when you know how :)
[08:50:27] <BillCriswell> As are most things haha
[08:50:52] <Omar-> hahaha
[08:50:52] <ChrisEarl> BillCriswell: indeed. thanks again, appreciate it
[08:51:00] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:51:23] <Omar-> or ("a:not([href*="fr-ca"])"
[08:51:48] <Omar-> ("a:not([href*=fr-ca'])" better
[08:52:03] <Omar-> i mean mind " and '
[08:52:31] <Omar-> BillCriswell are you active on SO?
[08:52:32] <BillCriswell> I think $('.mySection a').filter(function(){ return this.name.indexOf('fr-ca') === -1; }); would be quickest.
[08:52:51] <BillCriswell> Omar-: Here and there, not so much anymore.
[08:53:02] <BillCriswell> http://stackoverflow.com/users/191226/bill-criswell
[08:53:29] <Omar-> mine http://stackoverflow.com/users/1771795/omar
[08:53:31] <Omar-> only jQM
[08:53:41] <Omar-> and i've lost interest
[08:54:14] <Omar-> waiting for Arabic Language proposal to launch
[08:54:17] <BillCriswell> Omar-: It feels like the same questions over and over again anymore.
[08:54:19] <Omar-> BillCriswell http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/62022/arabic-language?referrer=XZcBcaeEwGD30j48QTDmGA2
[08:54:57] <BillCriswell> Er, this.href.indexOf() ^^
[08:55:10] <Omar-> true
[08:55:24] <Omar-> and users are being more aggressive
[08:55:36] <Omar-> that's why i'm active on jQM only
[08:55:45] <guy> Well, writing this library was surprisingly not as easy as I was hoping it to be... https://github.com/gajus/contents
[08:57:05] <Omar-> !ask guy
[08:57:14] <Omar-> bot isn't working
[08:57:17] <Omar-> ?ask guy
[08:57:22] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ guy
[08:57:22] <Omar-> hmmm
[08:57:22] <b-ot> guy: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[08:57:30] <Omar-> wb robertmaxrees
[08:57:43] <BillCriswell> Not sure he was asking anything lol
[08:57:57] <Omar-> it was a statement I assume
[08:58:01] <BillCriswell> Assuming they're a male.
[08:58:08] <guy> It was.
[08:58:24] <Omar-> advert? ;)
[08:58:43] <guy> Never liked the sound of that word.
[08:58:55] <guy> Though, I can easily turn it into a question. Is plugins.jquery.com closed.. ? eternally
[08:58:58] <BillCriswell> guy: https://github.com/h5o/h5o-js might interest you.
[08:59:32] <Omar-> guy there's no harm in showing your code that you believe is helpful for others
[08:59:48] <Omar-> i dont know
[09:08:43] <R13ose> BillCriswell: what are you confused about?
[09:09:32] <R13ose> BillCriswell: I meant I want 3x3 at the biggest on the desktop and for this to responsive otherwise.
[09:13:45] <BillCriswell> Then don't float them till you're at a certain width.
[09:14:29] <Omar-> guy regarding the demo, left panel isn't scrollable.
[09:14:46] <Omar-> http://gajus.com/sandbox/contents/demo/
[09:14:54] <guy> Omar-: It shouldn't be scrollable. Does it not fit in your screen?
[09:15:00] <guy> Whats the last thing on the list that you see.
[09:15:26] <Omar-> guy no, last anchor is can see on my 17" laptop is "Version history"
[09:15:38] <Omar-> Chrome browser
[09:15:43] <Omar-> is = I
[09:15:53] <Omar-> I can see
[09:16:24] <Omar-> and good job btw :)
[09:16:29] <guy> It should fit now
[09:16:33] <guy> Thank you
[09:16:51] <Omar-> a star for you
[09:17:04] <Omar-> now yes
[09:17:42] <guy> If you like quality (useful) plugins, checkout https://github.com/gajus/wholly if you haven't already.
[09:18:23] <Omar-> i'll check it out
[09:18:38] <Omar-> i'm not a programmer, but I like to mess around sometimes
[09:19:17] <Omar-> a job well done guy!
[09:19:25] <guy> Thank you. I am off for drinks.
[09:19:34] <R13ose> BillCriswell: From what I can tell I am not floating
[09:19:50] <Milk___> hello
[09:20:31] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Can I see the link again?
[09:21:18] <Omar-> hi Milk___
[09:21:26] <Milk___> :)
[09:21:31] <Omar-> :)
[09:21:32] <R13ose> BillCriswell: http://plushinteractive.ca
[09:22:57] <Omar-> R13ose i've found another bug
[09:23:26] <R13ose> Omar-: which is?
[09:23:52] <Omar-> if you scroll to portfolio, click right arrow and then scroll to any other section, back to portfolio, click "left" arrow, nothing happends unless you click "right" arrow
[09:24:05] <Omar-> happens*
[09:25:58] <R13ose> Omar-: yes but I am trying to get rid of the black area altogether.
[09:26:59] <Omar-> oh, so this is the problem? I didn't know that
[09:27:16] <Omar-> the black area when page moves to left
[09:27:18] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Did you remove the javascript that's adding the widths?
[09:28:52] <R13ose> BillCriswell: I re-added this.
[09:29:00] <R13ose> Omar-: yes
[09:29:06] <BillCriswell> That's causing all the black space though.
[09:29:18] <BillCriswell> Nevermind, going to eat pizza instead.
[09:29:47] <BillCriswell> R13ose: As far as I know you're trying to accomplish something like this:
[09:29:48] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/zodozetenubo/2/edit?css,output
[09:29:49] <BillCriswell> brb
[09:30:50] <Omar-> R13ose why dont you use flex-box?
[09:31:05] <Omar-> I guess the issue is "clear: both;"
[09:31:28] <Omar-> when I resize the window, I can see black boxes after each row
[09:32:00] <robertmaxrees> not sure what the problem is but http://www.heydonworks.com/article/tetris-and-the-power-of-css might help.
[09:32:06] <robertmaxrees> also: there's a great #css channel :)
[09:32:22] <R13ose> BillCriswell: yes.
[09:32:47] <R13ose> Omar-: I know but I am only trying to get rid of the black on the right side for now, and then will look into other screen sizes.
[09:33:22] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: maybe but I am using jQuery at the moment to do this.
[09:33:36] <robertmaxrees> sure, but the code you're currently working with is all css :)
[09:33:54] <robertmaxrees> just sayin'.
[09:34:04] <robertmaxrees> oh that was bill's example.
[09:34:05] <robertmaxrees> works for me.
[09:38:46] <Omar-> R13ose .row:after { clear: both; } is the problem
[09:41:03] <R13ose> Omar-: nope
[09:41:19] <Omar-> bootstrap.css line 759 and 749
[09:42:10] <Omar-> when I remove it - using devtools - row scrolls with no black areas
[09:42:45] <R13ose> Omar-: how many per row?
[09:42:51] <Omar-> I get "i love goldie" and "green fox" next to "t auto WH" on the right
[09:43:11] <Omar-> 5
[09:43:22] <Omar-> and then a black area next to "green fox"
[09:44:30] <R13ose> Omar-: right still black
[09:45:31] <Omar-> R13ose what you want to achieve is to scroll all blocks on same row, right?
[09:46:21] <R13ose> Omar-: as I said earlier 3x3 at the biggest width.
[09:47:04] <Omar-> not sure what you mean by 3x3
[09:47:54] <R13ose> Omar-: 3 images in each row that equals 3 rows.
[09:49:29] <BillCriswell> Jesus.
[09:50:25] <jafridi> Hey guys, does anybody have time to give code feedback on a jQuery countdown plugin?
[09:51:46] <Omar-> R13ose why the horizontal scroll then?
[09:53:30] <Omar-> jafridi i'm not a JS expert.
[09:54:55] <R13ose> oh I am going to relook at everything and if I need to come back tomorrow on this.
[09:55:18] <robertmaxrees> jafridi feel free to put it out there.
[09:55:26] <robertmaxrees> some folks may / may not have some suggestions for you.
[09:56:06] <jafridi> I've been trying to set up an automatic reset for Keith Wood's JQuery countdown. What I want to do is have the countdown end on a specific date, and then automatically reset for 7 days later for an indefinite amount of time. The code I'm about to attach works as a countdown until the specific date, but does not reset for 7 days later – instead, it idles at 0 hours 0 minutes 0 seconds.
[09:56:41] <jafridi> http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=3kcMNqGCcg
[09:57:01] <robertmaxrees> jafridi could you make a functioning example using jsfiddle?
[09:57:25] <KyleSmith> Is there a way to set values of these fields? http://puu.sh/caHTG/e07fed845c.png
[09:57:28] <KyleSmith> using jquery
[09:57:36] <robertmaxrees> .val()
[09:57:59] <robertmaxrees> $('input[name="LLP"]').val('some text');
[09:58:10] <KyleSmith> okay let me try that thnaks
[09:58:42] <KyleSmith> oh great
[09:58:44] <KyleSmith> thank you
[10:00:20] <rocky> anyone have a quick javascript snippet that will replace an in-place <img> tag with a js Image() object? i have loaded the Image() already and don't want to simply change the src of my <img> tag to the same thing because that will force it to load the image twice
[10:00:58] <robertmaxrees> rocky  the browser should already have it cached.
[10:01:14] <rocky> ok i should be safe then
[10:01:16] <jafridi> http://jsbin.com/fiwobiliboqu/1/
[10:01:23] <robertmaxrees> though I'd avoid using Image() if possible.
[10:01:51] <robertmaxrees> jafridi which need to include jquery and the plugin, too :)
[10:14:14] <jakey> $('<img/>').src(url) ?
[10:14:30] <robertmaxrees> .prop('src');
[10:14:37] <robertmaxrees> .prop('src', url);
[10:15:52] <respek> hello friends! another happy day in #jquery :)
[10:16:40] <jakey> if you could call documentin a 5 year old project happy :D
[10:16:59] <respek> ouch!
[10:17:28] <respek> a pretty invaluable task though :)
[10:18:19] <jakey> I'm assured :s
[11:07:39] <ethanwelborn> hey guys. $.remove() will loop through all the children and remove their event bindings and data before removing the node correct?
[11:08:04] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[11:08:08] <robertmaxrees> the description tells you :)
[11:08:40] <ethanwelborn> i read it, i just wanted a sanity check
[11:08:43] <ethanwelborn> danke
[11:09:36] <robertmaxrees> btw when asking about methods, you usually mean $.fn.methodName(), since there are some utilities under $.name
[11:19:51] <R13ose> BillCriswell: I tried your code, and this works.  The only problem is that the image are stretched out on very large screens is there a way around this?
[11:21:58] <BillCriswell> R13ose: You wouldn't put the width directly on the image, you'd put it in the container with something like max-width: 100% so the space around it grows instead of the image itself after a certain point.
[11:24:37] <R13ose> BillCriswell: okaty
[11:27:06] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Something along these lines: http://jsbin.com/zodozetenubo/4/edit?css,output
[11:28:47] <BillCriswell> R13ose: You could even use background image with background-size to 100%.
[11:28:54] <BillCriswell> Your call though.
[11:32:48] <R13ose> BillCriswell: are you saying use a background image instead of img or use a background image behind the images at a certain point?
[11:33:45] <BillCriswell> You can use either. The background image might be a little easier to handle position wise if you want things centered.
[11:34:01] <BillCriswell> I mean, you can do it with images, but way less fun.
[11:34:48] <jsmith483> hi can anyone help me with this
[11:34:51] <jsmith483> http://pastebin.com/CJWxsyB0
[11:35:01] <jsmith483> I am not sure why the href is not being set
[11:35:16] <jsmith483> the console.log definitely shows the correct string for the url
[11:35:51] <jsmith483> it seems just the set attr is not working
[11:36:29] <_rgn> reduce your example to something that can be run on jsfiddle
[11:36:48] <robertmaxrees> jsmith483 you want .prop, not .attr
[11:36:59] <jsmith483> and i misspelled robertmaxrees thanks!
[11:37:28] <jsmith483> sorry
[11:37:38] <jsmith483> i was typing i misspelled salector
[11:37:43] <jsmith483> then finsihed my thanks
[11:37:46] <jsmith483> to robertmaxrees
[11:38:22] <jsmith483> Yay
[11:38:31] <jsmith483> that fixed it
[11:38:34] <jsmith483> thanks again
[11:38:36] <robertmaxrees> yep
[11:42:03] <R13ose> BillCriswell: thanks, I will look into this and get back to you.
[11:43:26] <BillCriswell> Sweeeeet.
[12:09:31] <z1haze> Can someone please help me with datatables? I am trying to add a placeholder into the sera
[12:09:42] <z1haze> search* input with jquery, but for some reason I cant add anything to that box
[12:10:01] <z1haze> I tested it on another input and it worked fine, just the serach one wont work. I have the div and input isolated correct, as far as i can tell
[12:15:45] <Robdgreat> z1haze: let me try
[12:16:25] <z1haze> I know the code works beacause I attempted it on another input I have, but the search just wont work
[12:20:17] <z1haze> I think the datatables file I am using is a bit modified because some of if i use the cdn one, it takes one of the columns for "username" and just changes all of the values so a string of numbers rather than the username
[12:26:13] <z1haze> any luck
[12:26:20] <ashgotti> Hello everyone. I need a bit of help with something and I'm not sure if it's possible. I'm trying to autopopulate fields two ways: I have 4 fields -> if the first 3 are completed, the 4th should be autopopulated. If the first 2 and 4th is, the 3rd field should be populated. It's also done live. It's a bit of a mess right now and I know it's because the compute function is called each time but I don't know how else ot have it live: http://jsfiddle.net/wccznm
[12:26:41] <robertmaxrees> 404 link, ashgotti
[12:26:58] <ashgotti> Really? works for me http://jsfiddle.net/wccznmr3/
[12:27:08] <robertmaxrees> you were missing the last 2 chars.
[12:27:16] <ashgotti> oh sorry, mssage must have cut off
[12:28:10] <z1haze> I tried this Robdgreat; $('.dataTables_filter input').prop('placeholder', 'Search...'); i just cant get it to work for the search input
[12:28:15] <robertmaxrees> are you just looking for advice on how to improve, ashgotti ?
[12:28:31] <Robdgreat> z1haze: sorry, got sidetracked
[12:28:34] <ashgotti> robermaxrees: if you try it, it doesn't work properly: values aren't retained
[12:29:04] <robertmaxrees> well yeah, you're stomping all over your vars and stuff.
[12:29:09] <ashgotti> Complete Estimated value, principle should = Estimated value. If you enter a downpayment, Principle shoudl subtract that from it's value. I
[12:29:16] <ashgotti> Ya my brain is mush with it now
[12:29:28] <robertmaxrees> you're overcomplicating it a bit.
[12:29:39] <ashgotti> haha and I thought I was simplifying it
[12:30:42] <z1haze> ok?
[12:30:46] <z1haze> anyone else? im stumped here
[12:31:26] <robertmaxrees> ashgotti so the first thing I'd do is cache all your selectors before the function.
[12:31:30] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to rerun that.
[12:32:17] <Robdgreat> z1haze: the placeholder is meant to be set when the datatable is instantiated
[12:32:30] <ashgotti> robertmaxrees: so move the vars out, fetch it once on dom ready?
[12:33:00] <robertmaxrees> ashgotti i'll show you, one sec.
[12:33:49] <z1haze> but whre robdgreat? I'm aware of that anyways, but you /should/ be able to add it with jquery after the fact
[12:35:12] <robertmaxrees> ashgotti this doesn't work atm but you get the idea: http://jsfiddle.net/wccznmr3/1/
[12:35:24] <robertmaxrees> also, there's no need to make realVal a child of computeD
[12:35:35] <robertmaxrees> in fact, I wouldn't do that if possible.
[12:36:22] <robertmaxrees> move that declaration outside of computeD and explicitly pass in the data it needs.
[12:36:26] <ashgotti> robermaxrees: Thanks for the help. I'm confused though, how is moving the vars outside of the function and then creating vars that point to them any different
[12:36:38] <robertmaxrees> more efficient in this case.
[12:36:42] <Robdgreat> z1haze: you're right. When I console.log the placeholder immediately after allegedly setting it (in the DT code it uses attr() rather than prop(), fwiw - neither is working for me)
[12:36:48] <Robdgreat> it shows undefined
[12:37:05] <ashgotti> Maybe it helps with my use case: the user may fill in the fields in any order so I want to autocomplete the remaining fields
[12:37:19] <z1haze> any ideas?
[12:37:36] <robertmaxrees> to directly answer your specific problem you're setting the .val() for both of those fields always, no matter what.  you should setup some kind of .data() or other flag to know which ones were supplied and which ones were not.
[12:37:38] <z1haze> attr shoudl work to othough, right?
[12:38:25] <Robdgreat> the reason it wasn't working was I was trying to do it before creating the datatable
[12:38:32] <Robdgreat> change to attr and it will work
[12:39:29] <R13ose> BillCriswell: hi, I want to know if you can check the site and see if the portfolio images are still stretched out on large screens?  If so, what am I doing wrong, as I followed everything you said.
[12:40:14] <robertmaxrees> really bums me out the datatables guy won't set up an IRC channel.
[12:40:16] <robertmaxrees> really frustrating.
[12:41:10] <pheas> R13ose: frustrating isnt it
[12:41:10] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: people love dealing with forums, though
[12:41:16] <pheas> looks good though
[12:41:33] <R13ose> pheas: yes.  How did your search engine go yesterday?
[12:41:48] <robertmaxrees> Robdgreat we get a lot of datatables help requests here and we're not really a great place for it =/
[12:42:06] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: seems like pitching it as an adjunct to the free forum would be helpful
[12:42:14] <robertmaxrees> Robdgreat i did.
[12:42:20] <robertmaxrees> and he said "no"
[12:42:37] <robertmaxrees> well, really he said he didn't want to take the time for it and didn't really seem open to discussing it further.
[12:42:50] <Robdgreat> what's to stop someone from creating ##datatables and inviting knowledgeable people to join for free community help?
[12:43:07] <robertmaxrees> you tell me.
[12:43:49] <Robdgreat> well, besides the fact that someone already created it a few months back
[12:43:51] <Robdgreat> heh
[12:44:01] <ortund> if I have multiple classes on a div, how would I determine if one of them is (for example) "modal"?
[12:44:15] <robertmaxrees> ortund use .hasClass()
[12:47:41] <BillCriswell> R13ose: #slide-3 a should not be inline-block;  #slide-3 img should not have width: 100%; #slide-3 .col-12 should be background-color: #fff;
[12:48:38] <z1haze> attr works?
[12:49:03] <z1haze> Rodbgreat: so you think $('.dataTables_filter input').attr('placeholder', 'Search...'); will work, i tried that too
[12:49:16] <Robdgreat> I don't think, I know it worked for me
[12:49:50] <z1haze> wher were you including it then? i think that may be the my issue as well, doing it before its created as you said
[12:49:54] <Robdgreat> when it didn't work it was because I was setting the value for an element that didn't yet exist (was before my datatables() call)
[12:51:11] <z1haze> i guess what im asking, it should be on document ready right, should i have a different time at which to call this?
[12:51:18] <z1haze> $(document).ready(function() { ?
[12:51:32] <Robdgreat> yup
[12:51:41] <z1haze> thats not working.
[12:51:44] <Robdgreat> that's where I have it. It's also where my datatables() call is
[12:51:46] <ortund> thanks robertmaxrees *tips hat*
[12:52:09] <z1haze> http://terminushosting.com/covanilla/index.php robdgreat, check out my active one
[12:52:22] <z1haze> click a box on the left and press serach
[12:53:00] <Robdgreat> it just prompts me to login
[12:53:16] <z1haze> ctrl f5 i removed the session stuff
[12:53:21] <z1haze> shift*
[12:53:44] <z1haze> it /should/ let you in?
[12:55:13] <R13ose> BillCriswell: updated based on your feedback
[12:55:31] <Robdgreat> z1haze: not letting me in
[12:56:37] <z1haze> oh well, I did what you did and just entered it inside of the datatables call
[12:56:45] <z1haze> It worked.
[12:56:55] <BillCriswell> R13ose: Right right.
[12:57:54] <Robdgreat> sweet
[12:58:02] <R13ose> BillCriswell: you think this is perfect?
[12:58:53] <BillCriswell> I don't think anything is perfect haha
[13:00:22] <BillCriswell> R13ose: The height can't be static if you want the images to resize.
[13:02:17] <R13ose> BillCriswell: that means the image will be super huge on large screens right?
[13:03:11] <BillCriswell> No, the max-width would be 100% of the images size.
[13:03:56] <Omar-> hi robertmaxrees
[13:05:54] <BadCodSmell> Is it possible in jquery to determine if an event has already been processed?
[13:06:12] <respek> wouldn't that be an even listener?
[13:06:15] <respek> *event
[13:06:24] <BadCodSmell> No
[13:06:26] <respek> !on
[13:06:31] <respek> !api on
[13:06:31] <b-ot> Respek: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:06:40] <respek> hm
[13:06:52] <BadCodSmell> Lets say I have <div><div/></div> ... both have an on click
[13:07:04] <respek> ok
[13:07:10] <BadCodSmell> When the inner div is clicked, I don't want the outer div to catch it as well
[13:07:17] <BadCodSmell> And I don't want to use stop propagation.
[13:07:42] <BadCodSmell> Instead I would like, has something else already acted on this event... if so abort
[13:08:00] <BadCodSmell> Maybe I could set a marker on the event I guess
[13:08:22] <Omar-> stoppropagation BadCodSmell
[13:08:22] <BadCodSmell> But perhaps jquery already drops one as having to do that in every toplevel component would be annoying
[13:08:29] <BadCodSmell> That's not what I want.
[13:08:33] <BadCodSmell> Actualy it's dangerous
[13:08:37] <Omar-> !api stoppropagation
[13:08:40] <BadCodSmell> Generally implies bad programming skills
[13:08:41] <b-ot> Omar-: No matches.
[13:08:46] <BadCodSmell> I want inversion of control.
[13:09:01] <respek> !api event.stoppropagation
[13:09:02] <b-ot> Respek: event.stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event.    http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[13:09:11] <BadCodSmell> The only good use for stoppropagation might be some optimisations
[13:09:20] <Omar-> BadCodSmell event.target?
[13:09:22] <BillCriswell> BadCodSmell: Just add a class to event.target
[13:09:32] <BadCodSmell> Any what if I have another parent that wants to pick up clicks?
[13:10:52] <BillCriswell> BadCodSmell: http://jsbin.com/debotebepenu/1/edit?html,css,js,output ?
[13:10:53] <BadCodSmell> Hmm odd but possibly effective approach if I understand what it does
[13:12:07] <BillCriswell> BadCodSmell: http://jsbin.com/debotebepenu/2/edit *
[13:12:24] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/debotebepenu/3/edit?js,output * dammit
[13:12:24] <BadCodSmell> That doesn't seem to do what I want unless it's not updating the .clicked
[13:12:37] <Omar-> BadCodSmell event.target is the element that received the event
[13:14:27] <BadCodSmell> Honestly this doesn't make much sense
[13:15:11] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[13:15:25] <Scriptonaut> hey guys, looking through some code I foudn teh following: $('.checkbox').checkbox(). apparently checkbox() isn't a method, this may be a stretch, but what do you think the author was going for?
[13:15:43] <BadCodSmell> Oh
[13:15:49] <BadCodSmell> That's useless
[13:15:58] <BillCriswell> Scriptonaut: Probably some plugin that make checkboxes pretty.
[13:16:02] <BillCriswell> BadCodSmell: What is?
[13:16:09] <BadCodSmell> The adding a class thing
[13:16:13] <__joshua__> yeah, likely a plugin
[13:16:18] <Omar-> BadCodSmell what do you want to achieve? setup a fiddle and let's know what you want
[13:16:32] <BadCodSmell> Inversion of control instead of using stopPropagation
[13:16:38] <R13ose> BillCriswell: which way is better?  The way I have now or the way you are talking about this now?
[13:16:56] <BillCriswell> R13ose: I'm not sure I'm following you.
[13:17:20] <Omar-> !api event.target
[13:17:20] <b-ot> Omar-: event.target:  The DOM element that initiated the event.   http://api.jquery.com/event.target/
[13:17:34] <R13ose> BillCriswell: no worries.  I know what needs to happen, thanks again.
[13:17:34] <BillCriswell> BadCodSmell: This is telling you if an event has already happened or not by adding a class to that element.
[13:17:42] <BillCriswell> R13ose: No problem.
[13:17:56] <Omar-> R13ose you got fixed?
[13:18:00] <BillCriswell> Which sounded like exactly what you asked.
[13:18:02] <BadCodSmell> The problem is, presumably the target gives no indication of whether an event has already been handled
[13:18:02] <Omar-> got it
[13:18:25] <BadCodSmell> Not without manipulating it.
[13:18:29] <BillCriswell> It'll have a class letting you know it happened.
[13:18:38] <R13ose> Omar-: to an extent
[13:18:40] <BadCodSmell> In which case I could just set a handled property on the event object probably
[13:19:29] <BillCriswell> You can use .data() or something else and do $target.data('clicked', true); and then if $target.data('clicked').
[13:19:56] <BillCriswell> It won't be the same event object.
[13:20:34] <Omar-> R13ose good luck :)
[13:20:35] <BillCriswell> You need to bind it to the element in some way.
[13:20:41] <R13ose> Thanks
[13:23:04] <BadCodSmell> Then I need to unbind it when everything is done
[13:23:14] <BadCodSmell> Looks like jQuery is not kind on IOC
[13:23:22] <BillCriswell> lol ok
[13:23:26] <BillCriswell> Have fun.
[13:23:31] <BadCodSmell> Event object does appear to be different each time
[13:24:19] <BadCodSmell> Well actually
[13:24:24] <BadCodSmell> There's a data property
[13:24:32] <Omar-> !api data
[13:24:32] <b-ot> Omar-: .data(): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[13:24:34] <BillCriswell> I said that like 5 lines ago.
[13:24:50] <Omar-> BillCriswell more than 5 :P
[13:24:51] <BadCodSmell> I can't touch the target
[13:25:02] <Omar-> <BillCriswell> You can use .data() or something else and do $target.data('clicked', true); and then if $target.data('clicked').
[13:25:06] <BadCodSmell> $.data != event.data
[13:25:12] <Omar-> no different
[13:25:19] <BadCodSmell> I said already touching the element is out of the question
[13:25:22] <Omar-> $(this).data("whatever")
[13:25:34] <BillCriswell> BadCodSmell: I never said anything about event data.
[13:25:53] <jnesselr> Is there any way to use jQuery to find all the classes with a certain class, and then find if any of those have another class? For example, $(".A").anyHasClass("B")
[13:25:57] <BadCodSmell> Well I was talking about that
[13:26:15] <BadCodSmell> '.A .B' ?
[13:26:27] <BadCodSmell> or .A.B
[13:26:36] <BadCodSmell> If it needs to be elements with both classes
[13:26:40] <BillCriswell> No space
[13:27:15] <BadCodSmell> $('.A').filter('.B') maybe if your CPU is really bored.
[13:27:51] <jnesselr> BadCodSmell: Well that was easier than I thought.
[13:29:05] <BillCriswell> jnesselr: Same as CSs.
[13:29:18] <BadCodSmell> Instead of stopPropagation, can reissue the current event with alterations?
[13:29:51] <BillCriswell> BadCodSmell: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[13:30:02] <__joshua__> you could.  probably shouldn't
[13:34:42] <BadCodSmell> Yes, that is nasty... would be funny though
[13:35:15] <BadCodSmell> The funnier thing is that because I used a selector for my main click event it's running in the wrong order anyway.
[13:35:44] <BadCodSmell> It looks like I can only do it the old school way for generic handling.
[13:36:28] <__joshua__> I missed the start of your problem BadCodSmell, what do you need to achieve?
[13:37:10] <BadCodSmell> For a bottom level click event to abort its self if another higher level click event in the dom has been run (must work repeatedly).
[13:37:44] <BadCodSmell> But I have .on('.lowest_level', '.highest_level', f)
[13:37:59] <BadCodSmell> So it was never going to work
[13:38:37] <BadCodSmell> Instead I'll have to resort to tagging evert element when a click event is added which is a minor annoyance but not the end of the world.
[13:39:16] <ortund> can anyone tell me why this doesn't work? I reworked some stuff and it broke... http://jsfiddle.net/LYoung/0t0mshd2/
[13:39:21] <frank_o> shoky: Thanks again for last night man, it turned out just perfect. My code is now 10x faster thanks to your deferred setup :)
[13:40:06] <ortund> derp... think its that hasclass that wrecked it
[13:40:17] <__joshua__> BadCodSmell why not just delegate?  $('.top').on('click div:not(".someparentclass")  .actualbutton')
[13:41:08] <ortund> now I'm not sure how to get the content of .software-content into my #modalMessage... http://jsfiddle.net/LYoung/0t0mshd2/1/
[13:42:28] <BadCodSmell> Honestly it's easier to just have if($(target).is('.has_on_click'))return;
[13:42:44] <BadCodSmell> But then I wonder how that works clicking something that's within the target
[13:43:03] <ortund> thats not something I'd ever have considered...
[13:46:21] <BadCodSmell> $(this).parent("div").css("display", "none");
[13:46:45] <BadCodSmell> $('#modelDialog').css("display", "none");
[13:46:56] <BadCodSmell> Surely you want absolute...
[13:47:10] <BadCodSmell> Honestly I kind of frown upon using relative like that in jquery
[13:47:18] <BadCodSmell> Especially by elements.
[13:48:05] <BadCodSmell> Anyway you'll have less problems if you use your selectors consistently.
[13:50:06] <Omar-> !ask @ frank_o
[13:50:06] <b-ot> frank_o: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

[13:50:28] <BadCodSmell> ortund what are you trying to accomplish?
[13:50:38] <frank_o> ?
[13:50:58] <Getty> i dont get jqueryui tabs.... a <a href="#target"></a> doesnt work outside of the <ul></ul> on the tabs init <scratchhead>
[13:51:58] <Omar-> frank_o just a poke :P
[13:52:12] <frank_o> lol
[13:52:19] <frank_o> i ask in here all the time i'll have you know :)
[13:52:39] <Omar-> ask about jQM haha
[13:53:15] <ortund> Anyone see anything wrong with this selector? Its to close my modal dialog... $("#modalTitle, #modalMessage, #modal-background, #modalControls div").click(function() {
[13:54:16] <__joshua__> so you have 4 different ways to close it?
[13:54:39] <frank_o> Omar-: not much jqm expertise around these parts though :/
[13:54:43] <ortund> well, I cut it down to 2... the background and the div (not the title or the message anymore)
[13:55:23] <ortund> meh turns out I left out quotes for the selector on the next line after that :/ #latenightprogramming lol
[13:55:28] <Omar-> frank_o the time will come ;)

[14:27:11] <Reedyseth> Hello Guys !!
[14:27:41] <Reedyseth> anyone here know how to get the identification of a jquery UI dialog instance ?
[14:28:16] <Reedyseth> ?
[14:28:53] <__joshua__> identification?
[14:29:49] <__joshua__> if you mean id, I don't think dialogs are assigned ids
[14:30:15] <Reedyseth> Yes, something like an object ID. Is just that I am creating an instance of the dialog on a Ajax request, more specific the success function
[14:31:01] <Reedyseth> then when I want to check for the existence of the the dialog in order to destroy it I cannot find the created dialog
[14:31:56] <__joshua__> then assign it to a variable.
[14:32:04] <Reedyseth> Using the instance method of the dialog does not work for me for the same reason.
[14:32:08] <__joshua__> var dialog = $('someel').dialog();
[14:34:17] <Reedyseth> The thing is that The variable will be lost since I call a function, inside this function is the $.ajax() request.
[14:35:08] <Reedyseth> A solution would be creating a global variable, but I want to avoid this. Any another suggestion ?
[14:36:26] <__joshua__> avoid globals sure.  but you handler (that needs the dialog reference) and the dialog creation itself should probably share some scope
[14:37:03] <__joshua__> var dialog;  $.get('blah).done(function(){ dialog = $(blah).dialog(); });
[14:40:34] <Reedyseth> __joshua__: for example, I have a function named initModelEditAutocompleteDatatable(), inside that function I have my request and on the success I create the dialog, until there everthing is fine
[14:41:33] <__joshua__> and at some other point of the code you want to destroy the dialog?
[14:42:36] <Reedyseth> but if this function is called again the the dialog is created +1, this is why I want to remove the old one, the selector of the dialog is inside a HTML loaded previously, is not on the same page, this is why I cannot instantiate the dialog outside the function
[14:43:35] <Reedyseth> Yes, that point will be before another ajax request, on the beforeSend() function of $,ajax()
[14:45:32] <__joshua__> i would avoid the dom.  have a global, such as var App = {dialog: null}.  put your dialog in there.
[14:45:48] <Reedyseth> I guess I will use that
[14:45:53] <Reedyseth> I have this code: http://jsfiddle.net/5dmhyx0q/
[14:50:02] <Reedyseth> I am working with the global, if it works I let you now.
[15:38:59] <Reedyseth> How to mention someone here on the chat ?
[15:39:09] <robertmaxrees> use their name.
[15:39:18] <robertmaxrees> without anything right before it.
[15:40:22] <respek> or start their name, and hit tab, that's what I do
[15:40:36] <Reedyseth> thanks, the name plus tab worked !
[15:40:37] <robertmaxrees> that just autocompletes in some clients.
[15:40:55] <respek> robertmaxrees: :p (r + tab + :P)
[15:41:25] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:41:27] <Reedyseth> __joshua__: Now is working, I had to change the entire code, but you comments inspired me
[15:41:45] <__joshua__> :)
[15:48:53] <hactor> Hey folks, I'm confused how to refactor this code:   $(window).resize(function (e) { ...}); so I can off() that specific handler, not all
[15:49:04] <hactor> Can I give a handler a label or something?
[15:49:21] <robertmaxrees> set a boolean in a parent scope and run an if check, instead.
[15:49:48] <__joshua__> you can namespace it
[15:50:01] <__joshua__> $(window).on('resize.myresize');
[15:50:18] <__joshua__> $(window).off('resize.myresize);
[15:51:48] <hactor> __joshua__, that's interesting. And it's still the same resize event huh? Are there other uses for namespaces?
[15:52:07] <__joshua__> other uses include triggering
[15:52:13] <hactor> Oh yeah
[15:52:14] <hactor> Man
[15:52:17] <__joshua__> $(window).trigger('resize.someother')
[15:52:22] <hactor> __joshua__, thanks :) That's fun
[15:52:28] <Mark___> morning
[15:52:36] <hactor> robertmaxrees, thanks I wanted something a bit different :)
[15:53:08] <robertmaxrees> i tend to prefer not adding/removing handlers, so that's how I approach things. it's all good.
[15:53:12] <MeXTuX> Hi! I need to add behavior to certain link elements. Is it better doing this by class or by id?
[15:53:25] <__joshua__> I add and remove them like a crazy person.
[15:53:29] <robertmaxrees> MeXTuX are there many links that you want to do it to?
[15:53:38] <__joshua__> but i don't usually use namespaces
[15:53:55] <robertmaxrees> MeXTuX IDs can only be used once per page, classes can be used many times.
[15:56:06] <MeXTuX> But when using classes to add behavior I think it's a good idea to use some prefix to know that a certain class exists not for styling purposes
[15:56:21] <MeXTuX> js-my-class
[15:56:24] <robertmaxrees> MeXTuX i personally disagree - we recently had this discussion at work.
[15:56:35] <robertmaxrees> some places do that, though.
[15:57:00] <robertmaxrees> don't use IDs when working with many elements like that, either way.  use Classes.
[16:19:38] <ortund> can someone tell me why my lightbox images just open in new tabs? (click on Netguest block to see the thumbnails) http://loganyoung.za.net/my-portfolio/
[16:20:11] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[16:22:19] <ortund> robertmaxrees no errors there
[16:22:28] <robertmaxrees> i get one when i open that modal.
[16:22:35] <robertmaxrees> $.browser isn't defined.
[16:22:42] <ortund> O_o
[16:22:58] <ortund> all I have is "Cannot read properly 'msie' of undefined
[16:22:59] <robertmaxrees> which means you have a plugin relying on a fairly old version of jquery.
[16:23:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah, msie is a property of browser - same difference.
[16:23:35] <robertmaxrees> also: where's the code for the lightbox?
[16:24:32] <ortund> robertmaxrees line 215 in the View Source shows it
[16:24:58] <robertmaxrees> erm..
[16:25:17] <robertmaxrees> http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/ would be really helpful here.
[16:25:35] <ortund> dunno how I'm supposed to reduce it... its a wordpress plugin
[16:25:45] <ortund> the readme says its just supposed to magically work
[16:26:02] <robertmaxrees> i'd check somewhere that supports wordpress then./
[16:27:33] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, look into why you're getting that error and make sure there's nothing else you need to do.
[16:29:54] <ortund> apparently that msie error has something to do with background fading
[16:30:07] <robertmaxrees> yep, but uncaught errors can cascade into other issues.
[16:31:17] <ortund> its a check to see if the browser is ie
[16:32:14] <robertmaxrees> not going to change what i just said, but OK.
[16:33:11] <ortund> good call robertmaxrees
[16:33:26] <ortund> removed those msie errors (just commented them out - and the lightbox works now
[17:19:15] <Technodrome> what do you call it when you trigger events based on scroll status?
[17:19:21] <Technodrome> i need some documentation on this
[17:24:48] <kevireilly> Technodrome: this one? http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[17:25:41] <Technodrome> so many do it based on scroll position though, once this get scrolled to a certain point, text slides in
[17:25:42] <Technodrome> tc etc
[17:26:02] <robertmaxrees> waypoints is a library that does that kind of thing.
[17:40:53] <kevireilly> Technodrome: another one is "inview"

[20:31:57] <mdev> been trying to convert whatever browser time to UTC
[20:32:06] <mdev> so freaking annoying how hard this is to do in javascript
[20:55:54] <Unopoo> can I set .hide() 's callback to multiple function? how?
[21:04:31] <GoSox> so i'm clicking on my 'delete' class, and nothing is happening. There's probably some stupid error here somewhere but i'm not seeing it
[21:04:32] <GoSox> http://pastebin.com/Jy4dbLRs
[21:13:35] <GoSox> hmmm using some log flagging, it seems like my slideUp callback, from line 5 to line 9, is not running at all. but line 3 itself is run, as is line 11.
[21:13:38] <GoSox> thats very strange
[21:16:23] <GoSox> does .slideUp( )'s callback function get called even if object was not visible in the first place?
[21:20:41] <shoky> GoSox: you're removing .delete_row in line 5, so the "this" element is now not in the DOM, so the rest of the lines don't do anything
[21:21:38] <GoSox> yeah but i'm creating a new .delete_row after that, none of my "this" is referencing .delete_row
[21:21:52] <shoky> sure it is
[21:22:00] <GoSox> oh it is... but not on purpose :O
[21:22:05] <shoky> "this" is the div inside delete_row
[21:22:10] <shoky> hm?
[21:22:30] <shoky> and you're not creating anything, because you're putting it .after something that isn't in the dom
[21:24:13] <shoky> er sorry i got that last part wrong, you're inserting it after $this_row but $this_row is probably empty
[21:24:27] <GoSox> wait thats not right, because line 5 isn't even run
[21:24:55] <GoSox> i think my problem is that the slideUp on line 3 isn't calling it's callback
[21:25:02] <GoSox> i dont' know why though
[21:25:29] <shoky> jsfiddle it if you want more help
[21:28:22] <GoSox> http://jsfiddle.net/59yc1cyL/2/
[21:28:39] <GoSox> .delete is the circled X in the "~" column
[21:29:38] <shoky> where's .delete_row ?
[21:29:54] <GoSox> this one actually has jquery loaded http://jsfiddle.net/59yc1cyL/3/
[21:30:18] <GoSox> ahhh there isn't a .delete_row to start with
[21:30:22] <GoSox> now it makes sense
[22:19:40] <neybar> I'm working on building a slide show (cause the world needs another one).  I'm pre loading my images by building a list of $('<img src="">').  I'm planning on cloning random elements from that array and then attaching/detaching to the dom.  The question is if I set my master array to [] will garbage collection happen correctly and clear out those loose $('<img>') elements, or do I need to be more proactive?
[22:23:00] <djQuery> neybar, sorry I cant help, but wanted to congratulate you on asking a decent q on building a slideshow
[22:56:59] <BrunoLM> Bug: "failed to execute setRequestHeader on XmlHttpRequest". Steps to reproduce: 1. Object.prototype.GetHashCode = function(e) { return e.toString() }; 2. $.ajax({ url: "./", complete: function(e) { console.log(e.statusText); });
[22:59:12] <BrunoLM> seems to happen only in a Chrome Extension. hmm. nvm
[23:03:32] <Unopoo> how to make a selectioin UNDER/IN current selection?
[23:04:13] <Unopoo> like I selected form#num1, and only want to select input.text in from#num1
[23:05:49] <Unopoo> even now form#num2 contain input.text, it won't be selected?
[23:21:09] <intoxicated> Hello yall, I would like to contribute to jquery as new comer, what's best way to start on it? any suggestions ?
