[01:39:47] <pokmo> hi
[01:39:58] <pokmo> does this.$el.find() return null if the element cannot be found?
[01:44:31] <Zyquil> Hi, I'm using dynamic form fields via clone and appendto. The parent(original field before button is pressed to create more fields) has bloodhound typeahead in them populated via ajax. Is there a way to do the same for the cloned elements without breaking the form?
[01:57:26] <codingCookie> hello guys, i'm struggeling with scrollTo with jquery. I just don't understand where the diffrence these both is. I created two fiddles. My goal is to write a function that i can use it with my whole navigation.

[06:45:01] <narbeh> hey guys, is this jquery ? http://paste.ubuntu.com/26094807/ can I ask my question here or it's javascript ?
[09:29:15] <Aquazi> I have an xml document
[09:29:45] <Aquazi> ifI do $("w\\:body").children().length, tells me the number of children
[09:30:09] <Aquazi> ifI do $("w\\:body").children()[2] it gives me a jquery object
[09:30:25] <Aquazi> with type, name, attribs
[09:30:51] <Aquazi> ifI do $("w\\:body").children()[2].removeAttr("foo") raises an error
[09:31:35] <Aquazi> $(...).children(...)[2].removeAttr is not a function
[09:31:42] <Aquazi> why
[09:32:40] <shoky> Aquazi: [2] gives you the raw DOM element, not a jquery object.  .eq(2)  will give you a jquery obj
[09:32:43] <Aquazi> type of $("w\\:body").children()[2] is correctly an object
[09:32:48] <Aquazi> oh
[09:33:06] <Aquazi> so it's an object..but not a jquery one
[09:33:17] <shoky> yop
[09:37:36] <Aquazi> I can't get to remove the attr
[09:37:45] <Aquazi> even with .eq(2)
[09:39:03] <shoky> Aquazi: why are you removing an attribute? usually it's not something you want to do
[09:39:17] <Aquazi> long story
[09:39:55] <shoky> also uh, you have a <w:body>  element?
[09:40:26] <Aquazi> yes
[09:40:56] <shoky> what attribute are you trying to remove, from what kind of element?
[09:41:40] <Aquazi> there are attributes I want to remove all over the document,
[09:41:50] <Aquazi> But I was failing with *, etc
[09:41:58] <Aquazi> so I tried to see if it was removing it one by one
[09:42:31] <Aquazi> shoky, https://gist.github.com/VulcanRav/921db5e8ad39e2b06ac0a436181654e4
[09:43:50] <shoky> Aquazi: don't escape the attribute
[09:44:01] <Aquazi> ?
[09:44:06] <Aquazi> why not
[09:44:32] <shoky> Aquazi:  because it doesn't need escaping. you pass the actual value of the attribute
[09:44:38] <Aquazi> woah
[09:44:40] <Aquazi> it finally works
[09:44:47] <Aquazi> it's gone
[09:44:56] <shoky> should work fine with $('*') too
[09:44:58] <Aquazi> I can't believe I was stuck for hours on this stupid thing
[09:45:38] <Aquazi> what if I want to remove an attribute on every single tag in my document
[09:45:51] <shoky> as i just said.. :p
[09:45:53] <Aquazi> so it needs to check all the children and grandchildren and so on
[09:46:06] <Aquazi> hmmm, no it's not okay because I need this in the root
[09:46:10] <Aquazi> but not in the body
[09:46:23] <shoky> hm?
[09:46:36] <Aquazi> $("w\\:body").find("*").removeAttr() should work
[09:47:03] <Aquazi> it's slow tho
[09:47:39] <shoky> if there are many elements, sure. DOM manipulation is slow
[09:48:11] <Aquazi> like 12k
[09:48:58] <shoky> could be noticable, sure
[09:49:08] <Aquazi> could be 500k too
[09:49:13] <Aquazi> if not more
[09:49:20] <shoky> would be that much slower, then ;)
[09:49:33] <Aquazi> I'm doing all of this because node.js has no XSLT parser
[09:49:38] <Aquazi> I mean, processor
[09:49:46] <Aquazi> has only one, but it's paid
[09:49:57] <Aquazi> and requires a connection
[09:50:03] <shoky> that sounds odd.. but i'll take your word for it
[09:50:22] <Aquazi> it has parsers but no processors, checked github, checked npm
[09:50:44] <Aquazi> so I'm painfully trying to implement one with jquery
[10:26:55] <laclos> hi at all
[10:28:06] <laclos> a little needs: I have n.8 rooms and "n" person. I would to use drag n drop to place a person in a room
[10:29:03] <laclos> any suggestion?
[10:42:16] <Uhkis_> maybe a forklift?
[10:56:35] <zampa> If i have 2 divs overlapping each other, and i have a click event on one of them. how can i properly get it to trigger during the overlapping part?
[10:56:57] <zampa> As currently the events properly triggers when you click the one of the divs but any click in the overlapping area doesn't trigger.
[11:06:10] <zampa> Because rigth now im not sure it understands which div you are actually clicking on due to the overlapping.
[11:41:05] <shoky> zampa: one way is with css 'pointer-events: none'
[11:46:06] <Aquazi> how would I check if an element has a specific parent, and if it has that parent, replace it in the dom?
[11:47:15] <Aquazi> replaceWith() I guess
[11:50:15] <shoky> Aquazi:  by specific parent you mean a specific instance of an element in the DOM?  or just a specific element type
[11:51:05] <Aquazi> something like "if h2 is children of h1 then replaceWith"
[11:51:26] <Aquazi> it's actually more complicated as I need to figure siblings too
[11:51:30] <Aquazi> I'll figure it out ^^
[11:51:37] <shoky> do you mean: replace all h2's that are children of h1's ?
[11:52:05] <shoky> $('h1 h2').replaceWith(...)  for that
[11:52:24] <Aquazi> ni
[11:52:25] <Aquazi> no
[11:52:26] <shoky> or 'h1 > h2'  for direct children
[11:52:29] <Aquazi> replace h1 with h2
[11:52:43] <Aquazi> h2 must still contain all of his children tho
[11:52:50] <shoky> replace all h1's with h2?
[11:53:03] <Aquazi> h1 that doesn't cointain h2? no
[11:53:11] <Aquazi> h1 that contains h2? yes
[11:53:17] <Aquazi> h2 has hierarchy of h1 now
[11:53:29] <shoky> oh, you want to unwrap the h2 from inside the h1?
[11:53:40] <shoky> er
[11:53:57] <shoky> h2 has hierarchy of h1 now?  including the h2 inside..?
[11:54:25] <shoky> just give a small example ;p
[11:55:55] <Aquazi> <doc><h1><h2><h3></h3></h2></h1></doc> becomes <doc><h2><h3></h3></h2></doc>
[11:56:19] <Aquazi> but <doc><h1><h3></h3></h1></doc> stays the same
[11:56:34] <shoky> ok, so unwrapping
[11:56:46] <shoky> http://api.jquery.com/unwrap/
[11:57:34] <shoky> e.g.  $('h2').unwrap('h1')
[11:57:47] <Aquazi> this is very nice
[11:57:57] <shoky> though that is confusing, i'd rather:  $('h1 > h2').unwrap()  i think
[16:15:14] <rhizome> wtf is with jquery doc examples always having massive head tags for 2 lines of code
[19:18:40] <BoxingOreos> Hi, I have probably a very simple question and am definitely an amateur.  I have an html multiple select.  I'm triggering an event on changing this select.  How can I target just the object that is selected without running through any of the other selections?
[19:20:31] <BoxingOreos> I have it setup right now to go through all of the selected and unselected options to change an attribute dependent on whether it has been selected, and I'd rather have it just flip the attribute from true to false on whatever object has been changed last and leave the other selections alone.
[19:21:54] <BoxingOreos> Here's the snippet of my code I'm trying to fix... https://jsfiddle.net/hyL3dbLz/
[19:26:09] <rhizome> 'this' should be the item from your select after it changes
[19:26:23] <rhizome> not sure what happens with a multiselect
[19:32:58] <BoxingOreos> So if I run it just going off a change in the #grade id, it will only run off the first thing selected.  I have to iterate through all the selections to get to anything else.  I don't how to target the option just selected.  Running through everything is quite a bottleneck
[19:35:52] <BoxingOreos> I'd thing there'd a simple solution... but I'm also not sure how multi select is handled.   Does it just output things as an array... How does one identify specific selections?
[19:44:10] <rhizome> BoxingOreos: use .select()
[19:45:19] <rhizome> multiselect appears to generally be the domain of a plugin
[19:45:37] <rhizome> i don't want to say 'require' because hey, you could write it by hand
[19:49:48] <BoxingOreos> rhizome: Use .select() which way?
[19:50:07] <BoxingOreos> Sorry, i mean... How should I use .select()
[19:57:20] <rhizome> $('#grade').select(function() { $(this)...})
[19:57:29] <rhizome> something along those lines
[19:57:55] <rhizome> google "jquery select"
