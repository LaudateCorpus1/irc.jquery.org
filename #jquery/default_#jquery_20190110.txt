[00:33:19] <Rojola> still nobody around? :)
[01:05:55] <Cork> Rojola: if you want to show an example use a jsfiddle
[01:06:27] <Rojola> Cork, ok - I will
[01:06:32] <Rojola> Thank you
[01:17:12] <devi8> what is the syntax for getting the css transform rotation value on a jquery object? $("elem").css("transform:rotate") doesn't seem to work.
[01:17:33] <Cork> devi8: .css('transform')
[01:17:49] <devi8> oh, duh.
[01:17:51] <Cork> you will have to split the string your self; or install a plugin for transform parsing
[01:18:01] <Cork> (they exist)
[01:18:35] <devi8> oh it comes out a a string...not an object.
[01:20:44] <Rojola> Cork, I am sorry to tell, but I can not get the jsfiddle to work
[01:20:52] <Rojola> In the past, there was an option to save it
[01:20:56] <Rojola> even without an account
[01:21:06] <Rojola> now, I click run, and it runs,  but I don't get a URL
[01:26:18] <Cork> Rojola: save is right beside the run button
[01:26:23] <Cork> and ya, i don't have an account either
[01:26:41] <Rojola> Cork, it was there before in the past
[01:26:46] <Rojola> but now I don't get a Save-button
[01:26:56] <Rojola> wait, I refresh jsfiddle
[01:27:41] <Rojola> Cork, I know why!
[01:27:46] <Rojola> I used the boilerplate:
[01:27:47] <Rojola> http://jsfiddle.net/boilerplate/jquery
[01:27:50] <Rojola> ^ there is no Save-Button
[01:27:55] <Cork> jikes...
[01:28:09] <Cork> didn't know that
[01:28:39] <Rojola> I'd need to figure out how to add jquery to a plain fiddle
[01:28:56] <Rojola> I change my plan - I will make the script a 1-liner
[01:29:03] <Rojola> and paste it in the channel as 1 small line
[01:29:07] <Rojola> maybe somebody wants to help
[01:29:22] <Cork> in the script section click the down arrow and select jquery (edge)
[01:30:19] <Cork> Rojola: also a paste site is only needed if the code needs to be run to answer the question
[01:30:33] <Rojola> the code is so simple...
[01:30:39] <Cork> but you never asked a question so i can't tell what you want to ask
[01:30:44] <Rojola> I am sure it's only my logic that messes with me
[01:30:47] <Rojola> jQuery("#myfoobar").on('change', 'input[id^="foo_bar_"]',  function(e) { jQuery('input[id^="foo_bar_"]').change(function() { jQuery('input[id^="foo_bar_"]').prop('checked',false); jQuery(this).prop('checked',true); alert(this.id); }); });
[01:30:56] <Cork> ugg... that needs a paste
[01:30:59] <Cork> too long to read
[01:31:12] <Rojola> I give it up
[01:31:21] <Rojola> if you could really help, you would have :)
[01:31:24] <Rojola> thank you anyway
[01:31:28] <Rojola> I wish you a nice day
[01:31:29] <Rojola> bye bye
[01:31:40] <Cork> <_<'
[01:31:48] <Cork> fine by me
[01:47:44] <devi8> Cork, did you see my autocomplete that totally works? https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/vvzWmo?editors=1111
[01:48:31] <Cork> devi8: ok
[06:49:11] <skypce_> hi all good day
[06:49:17] <skypce_> hi devi8
[06:49:34] <skypce_> i was prepared a codepen with my code: https://codepen.io/skypce/pen/WLgaqQ
[06:49:40] <skypce_> the problem is same the undefined value
[06:50:07] <skypce_> i was testing your example devi8 but still continue giving me undefined value in extrafield vars
[07:13:43] <paule32> hello
[07:13:45] <paule32> give it a console like comoponent?
[07:18:50] <Cork> skypce_: exactly what variables can't you get access to where?
[07:20:57] <skypce_> by example i want access from outside of function to something like console.log($number_months.result);
[07:21:07] <skypce_> but i get undefined
[07:21:27] <Cork> you mean you want access from outside the outer scoping?
[07:21:43] <Cork> meaning outside (function() { ?
[07:22:29] <skypce_> i want get the selected option in the selects vars and use them in $extrafield var like a big string.
[07:23:00] <skypce_> i get in select vars undefined vars in all tries
[07:23:42] <Cork> wait a min... you have return values inside a change, taht won't work
[07:24:29] <Cork> all the calls to selectOption() will be identical to $($selector)
[07:24:43] <Cork> it won't give you the result value from inside the event handler
[07:25:35] <skypce_> mmm what can i do?
[07:26:24] <Cork> you need to change it so you don't depend on events
[07:27:55] <skypce_> can you give me a example please
[07:28:03] <skypce_> you say like no functions?
[07:54:33] <Cork> skypce_: well i'm not sure why you need to put it in the change event
[07:54:53] <Cork> i can't sit with it right now cause i have quite a lot poking at my attention
[07:55:00] <Cork> but i might have time in about an hour
[07:56:34] <skypce_> ok thank you
[08:41:13] <Cork> skypce_: ok
[08:41:24] <Cork> to start with selectOption doesn't need the change call at all
[08:42:11] <Cork> just do $("#number_adults options:selected").text()
[08:42:22] <Cork> * $("#number_adults option:selected").text()
[08:42:38] <Cork> skypce_: and i would prob recommend just skipping using that function entirely
[08:43:35] <skypce_> Cork , when i use it, always returns me the first value
[08:43:39] <skypce_> of select boxes
[08:43:58] <skypce_> selects are not listening the change state
[08:44:07] <Cork> they do
[08:44:19] <Cork> but you can't proactively wait for change to happen
[08:44:23] <Cork> if that is what you mean
[08:44:40] <skypce_> ok i will test again
[08:52:41] <skypce_> Cork
[08:52:50] <skypce_> how can do it for bootstrap datepicker
[08:52:51] <skypce_> m.fn.initÂ [input#datepicker-a.form-control, context: document, selector: "#datepicker-a"]
[08:53:50] <Cork> thats a datepicker, not a select element...
[08:54:06] <Cork> (input != select)
[08:54:25] <skypce_> i have this code working for it
[08:54:52] <Cork> for that specific element not possible
[08:55:01] <skypce_> but when i look it in console i cant get the value
[08:55:03] <skypce_> var $arrival = $("#datepicker-a").datepicker({
[08:55:03] <skypce_>     format: 'mm/dd/yyyy',
[08:55:03] <skypce_> }).on('changeDate', function(e) {
[08:55:03] <skypce_>     console.log(e.format());
[08:55:03] <skypce_>     return e.format();
[08:55:04] <skypce_> });
[08:55:21] <Cork> uh... that is not the code we talked about; also don't dump code in the channel
[08:55:33] <skypce_> ok it is few text
[08:55:38] <skypce_> no problem
[08:55:40] <skypce_> i will paste in codepen
[09:49:05] <sine0> hi folks, im back playing around again. is there a way to do a wait(3)
[09:50:57] <Cork> no
[09:51:16] <Cork> javascript hangs the browser when it runs so if you waited for 3 second it would hang everyting for 3 secontd
[09:51:30] <sine0> ok so its setintervalk
[09:51:32] <Cork> instead you need to use a callback solution and allow the execution to end
[09:51:46] <Cork> no its setTimeout
[09:51:55] <sine0> of course
[09:52:23] <Cork> setInterval is an implementation mistake from the old days
[09:52:49] <sine0> when you do .each() how do you match to the current one in the loop
[09:52:56] <sine0> I tried this
[09:53:09] <Cork> if you mean with the timeout; you don't
[09:53:15] <sine0> no forget timeout
[09:53:17] <Cork> you will have to make the loop async to make it work
[09:54:06] <Cork> well in a loop you just check if the value is the one matching the variable you have
[09:54:06] <sine0> for each div h2 matched, make them all visible none apart from the current one make that visible visible, wait 3 seconds and repeat through the matches
[09:54:23] <Cork> though note this is initiated for every function so you can't inherit it to a new function
[09:56:06] <sine0> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/roZgpM this is what i tried
[09:56:34] <sine0> I know if it were to work it would happen so quickly i would not even see it but im just playing/leraning
[09:57:36] <sine0> how could I do what i want to do with a 2 second interval
[09:57:52] <Cork> but... that will just be $('#mail h2').css('visibility', 'none'); $('#mail h2').last.css('visibility', 'visible')
[09:57:59] <Cork> cause you won't see the result
[09:58:09] <Cork> you need to make the code async like i said before
[09:58:19] <Cork> else the change won't have time to be visible to the user
[09:59:05] <Cork> sine0: it isn't about "too quickly" even if it was slow it wouldn't be visible
[09:59:16] <Cork> cause the execution doesn't have a time to get over to the rendering process
[09:59:34] <Cork> (cause for that to happen js has to end)
[10:01:32] <sine0> .last is not a function i got in browser
[10:01:49] <Cork> then you don't have jquery
[10:01:59] <sine0> https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.min.js
[10:02:09] <Cork> then you have .last
[10:03:23] <sine0> https://snag.gy/dG7zjC.jpg
[10:04:46] <sine0> last()
[10:05:20] <sine0> I should have realised that
[10:15:01] <sine0> Cork: how do i go about making it async
[10:16:54] <sine0> I have found some test code
[10:19:11] <Cork> sine0: https://jsfiddle.net/faod3gv5/
[10:19:25] * Cork afk
[11:04:33] <paule32> hello
[11:05:12] <paule32> i use "background-image:url('btn.png');" as css, but the picture will not display in a div
[11:05:16] <paule32> what is wrong?
[11:05:30] <paule32> i look server side: chmod 755 btn.png
[11:05:42] <paule32> i look server side: chmod 640 btn.png
[11:06:01] <paule32> restart /usr/sbin/apache2 -k restart
[11:06:08] <paule32> but nothing help
[11:16:14] <royalty> paule32, that's a loaded question, as it could be a number of problems, is btn.png where you expect it to be related to your css file
[11:16:42] <royalty> is it accessible, is your server env set up correctly to display images
[11:16:56] <royalty> paule32, this is also not a jquery question
[11:17:19] <paule32> ok, the picture is accessable
[11:42:53] <paule32> http://dpaste.com/3YQ4BGR
[11:51:25] <sine0> do called functions return back to caller automatically or need to use return
[11:52:20] <sine0> ahh, auto, but to exit early use return.
[11:52:36] <pavonia> or to return a result
[11:58:53] <pavonia> paule32: Could be a specificity problem. AFAIU, jQuery manipulates the CSS directly while in your stylesheet another, more specific selector might override the background image. Hard to tell without a full sample document
[12:17:00] <OnceMe> Hi
[12:17:32] <robertmaxrees> good morning
[12:19:26] <OnceMe> I have <li><a href="/aa" class="clicked"> Click</a> <ul class="level2"><li>....</li> and have jquery $(".clicked").on("click", function () { } how do I show only ul .level2 for that link in multi-hierchy structure?
[12:19:44] <robertmaxrees> fiddle pls.
[12:20:54] <paule32> OnceMe: have a look to css: display:none
[12:21:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:21:10] <paule32> OnceMe: or <div . hide/show
[12:22:05] <robertmaxrees> it may be an issue with not knowing how to target the ul when you click on the anchor.
[12:28:04] <OnceMe> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/sj91wfp5/
[12:30:29] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe ah, so there are a few ways to approach this.
[12:31:18] <robertmaxrees> one would be to toggle a class on a the parent li and target the "level2" ul through that.
[12:31:38] <OnceMe> ?
[12:31:46] <OnceMe> can u update the fiddle
[12:31:54] <robertmaxrees> OR just fix your $(this).closest('ul') - what you really want is $(this).closest('li').find('ul'
[12:31:58] <robertmaxrees> *R just fix your $(this).closest('ul') - what you really want is $(this).closest('li').find('ul')
[12:32:59] <OnceMe> lmao
[12:33:05] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:33:13] <OnceMe> ok dude, I was trying this shit for half an hour and you solved it in 3 seconds
[12:33:33] <OnceMe> dont know why I have tried closest ul instead of li
[12:33:43] <OnceMe> I guess I didnt read hierarchy correctly
[12:34:03] <robertmaxrees> .closest() starts at the current element and then goes through ancestors
[12:34:12] <robertmaxrees> your ul there is a sibling.
[12:40:09] <OnceMe> ah ok
[17:05:59] <rjCousineau> Hello. I have a 'blur' event bound to an input field, and it refocuses with setInterval( function(){ $('#input').focus(); }, 20);    however, i found a new requirement where a field needs to be focuses on.
[17:06:40] <rjCousineau> is there a way to cancel an event, or, exclude it
[17:07:06] <rjCousineau> *I have a new requirement where a different field needs focus
[17:14:24] <rjCousineau> nevermind. i'll just unbind() and bind() again
[18:47:21] <paule32> hello
[18:47:35] <paule32> i have problem with for loop and css
[18:47:37] <paule32> https://jsfiddle.net/b0arxghn/3/
[18:48:16] <paule32> i expect, that the menu items bring new color, when i enter/leave mouse
[18:54:46] <sine0> Lucida Console, can you beat that?
[19:04:10] <paule32> some ideas?
[19:07:14] <paule32> that is funny
[19:07:21] <paule32> $(id).mouseleave(function(){  $(this) . css('background-color','white')
[19:07:48] <paule32> the $(this) there is the key of luck
[19:08:19] <paule32> wonder me, why $(id) does not work
[19:13:56] <pavonia> $(id) in the handler uses the value of id at the time the handler is executed, not the current value in the loop
[19:34:21] <paule32> so
[19:34:27] <paule32> i have a div in div
[19:35:09] <paule32> but it seems that gives no universal css tag to vertical center the text in the div
[19:35:22] <paule32> or do i wrong?
[19:37:29] <skypce_> hey paule
[19:37:31] <skypce_> hey paule32
[19:37:44] <skypce_> try with display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center;

[19:40:46] <paule32> i have text in div
[19:40:58] <paule32> and the text should be vcenter
[19:41:12] <paule32> not the child div's

[19:44:03] <paule32> it work within the childs
[19:44:08] <paule32> not parent
[19:44:26] <skypce_> it works only in childs directly

[19:50:25] <paule32> so that the menu's a little bit descent from the yellow color
[19:51:01] <paule32> like a separator
[19:53:06] <skypce_> you can use a border:transparent
[19:53:15] <skypce_> and a outline:5px yellow;
[19:53:25] <skypce_> border-top:5px solid transparent;
[19:53:28] <skypce_> and a outline
[19:53:37] <skypce_> outline will be outside of border
[19:53:41] <skypce_> you can create the effect
[19:53:49] <skypce_> i dotn understand much your question
[19:54:07] <skypce_> i will give you a example
[19:55:32] <skypce_> you need over the pp?
[19:55:38] <skypce_> different yellow?
[19:55:45] <skypce_> you can surround the pp text in a span

[21:03:43] <paule32> is it possible to hide/show like:   visible := !visible; ?
[21:04:06] <skypce_> paule32, did you tty to do a chmod to the folder?

[21:19:16] <devi8> did you ever get the codepen I made for you?
[21:22:55] <paule32> i have another problem
[21:23:05] <paule32> all files has bit 755

[21:24:00] <paule32> or, the website(s) don't show as expected
[21:27:17] <devi8> paule32, this sounds like a question you should ask from #html or #web, not #jquery
[22:22:58] <devi8> anybody know how to animate height with flexbox?
[22:53:54] * devi8 kicks the tumbleweed blowing by before getting up the nerve to ask a question...
[22:54:38] <devi8> I am having a difficult time with an expandable FAQ layout in this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/neverDevi8/k086ojsx/43/
[22:55:04] <devi8> could someone give some suggestions as to a better approach or how to fix the animnation when you click the expand button?
