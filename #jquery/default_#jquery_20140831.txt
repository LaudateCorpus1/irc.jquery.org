[00:33:38] <tcpman> I have a question, im going to want to access some elements of html and change the css etc from jquery.. should i give the elements a class or id or is there a way i can grab the element like in console img[0] img[1]..  imagine i have 10 img tags in one table.. but eventualy i will have maybe 2 or 3 tables ??
[01:39:11] <uskerine> how would I say, the closest parent span element of a given #id?
[01:40:14] <uskerine> is taht .closest()?
[01:42:54] <shubhamgoyal> element.className returns undefined
[01:42:57] <Yaver> uskerine if i didn't say it before :) it's working :D
[01:43:26] <uskerine> how did you fix it?
[01:43:27] <shubhamgoyal> I know for sure that the element is in DOM because I am trying to see the classes on the console after the page is loaded
[01:43:43] <shubhamgoyal> Anybody has any ideas on why this is the case?
[01:43:57] <uskerine> @Yaver
[01:44:10] <Yaver> uskerine i had a 2nd problem (a 2nd json request  so now i use $.when
[01:44:30] <Yaver> with .done (function (a,b)
[01:45:03] <uskerine> never used .when
[01:45:58] <Yaver> you have a better solution to become 2 requests?
[01:47:30] <Yaver> http://nopaste.info/8dd1435866.html
[01:49:40] <uskerine> I see
[01:49:53] <uskerine> so you need two AJAX request
[01:49:55] <uskerine> ?
[01:49:59] <uskerine> requests
[01:50:03] <Yaver> yes
[01:50:11] <uskerine> and once they are completed you do the whole stuff
[01:50:47] <Yaver> at the  $('#registration_form').bootstrapValidator({ is a 3rd request
[01:51:19] <uskerine> anyway your code seems quite complex
[01:51:34] <Yaver> the first request take the auth token this token is needed for the rest requests
[01:51:52] <uskerine> I see
[01:51:58] <uskerine> can't chain them with .done() ?
[01:52:22] <uskerine> first request.done( -> second  request.done ( -> third request.done ( do the stuff ) ) )
[01:52:39] <Yaver> why not when?
[01:53:01] <uskerine> I find it difficult to read, but it is a personal opinion
[01:53:13] <uskerine> if works for you, that's perfect
[01:53:30] <uskerine> I have never faced your scenario yet
[01:53:57] <uskerine> I am glad you found a solution
[01:54:06] * Yaver too
[01:54:08] <Yaver> ;)
[01:54:31] <Yaver> now I've to clean the code -.-
[01:55:12] <uskerine> I have rewritten all my code in the application I am programming (this is my first jQuery/AJAX app)
[01:56:44] <uskerine> the first time I wrote the code it was highly redundant and difficult to read
[01:59:09] <tcpman> how could i show and hide somthing like this in jquery??
[01:59:17] <tcpman> .d_row1 .d_td2 .h1_seg
[02:00:16] <uskerine> $(".d_row1", ".d_td2", ".h1_seg").hide() and .show()
[02:01:36] <tcpman> wow that simple
[02:02:31] <tcpman> uskerine: thanks, but say i have .d_row1 .d_td2 .h1_seg X 9
[02:02:44] <tcpman> * 9
[02:04:26] <uskerine> what do you mean with * 9?
[02:04:31] <uskerine> you mean 18 elements?
[02:04:47] <uskerine> if they don't have anything in common (like a common class) you have to include them all
[02:05:12] <uskerine> otherwise you can add an extra class .mySuperSelector and just do $('.mySyperSelector').hide() or show()
[02:07:42] <tcpman> i tryed to add a class but it didnt work..
[02:08:28] <uskerine> it should
[02:09:40] <tcpman> uskerine: do you mean like this http://pastebin.com/qdweswP0
[02:09:57] <Yaver> -.- uskerinei think i have to build a chain :/
[02:10:19] <uskerine> no
[02:10:45] <uskerine> tcpman you have to add class="superclass" to elements having classes d_row1..... etc
[02:10:54] <uskerine> in html
[02:11:03] <uskerine> and then just use .superclass as jQuery selector
[02:12:25] <tcpman> uskerine: that won't work because i want individual elements of the same class to change, depending on input..
[02:14:15] <tcpman> uskerine: also ".d_row1" is for an element the parent of ".d_td2" who is a parent of ".h1_seg"
[02:14:26] <uskerine> I see
[02:14:38] <tcpman> who is and image, inside a td, inside a tr inside a table
[02:15:16] <tcpman> wich will ultimatly become a 7 segment digit of a clock
[02:16:35] <uskerine> are d_row1 d_td2 h1_seg classes?
[02:16:58] <tcpman> yep
[02:17:26] <uskerine> you can still do $(".d_row1 .d_td2 .h1_seg", ".d_row2 .d_td1 .h1_seg", .....).hide()
[02:18:32] <Yaver> uskerine it's possible tu put the result's from the 1st $.getJSON with done into the 2nd and third?
[02:19:40] <tcpman> uskerine: aha result, thanks.. but i can tell my code is gonna look like dirt when i finish :p
[02:19:41] <uskerine> Yaver I don't know, I guess it is but I don't know for sure
[02:20:32] <Yaver> Hmm ok i try it ;)
[02:21:53] <tcpman> uskerine:but do you think there is a way i could set this > http://pastebin.com/qdweswP0 < in the css, so i only have to call say $(".number_one").hide();
[02:22:10] <tcpman> uskerine: a class of classes maybe...
[02:22:25] <uskerine> tcpman if I were you I would try to mark individual segments with names
[02:22:26] <uskerine> http://macao.communications.museum/images/exhibits/2_18_6_3_eng.png
[02:22:35] <uskerine> from a to g
[02:23:13] <uskerine> and then code a function with a switch(digit) to hide all segments and show enabled ones
[02:24:06] <tcpman> jquery function
[02:24:22] <uskerine> javascript function yeah
[02:24:26] <uskerine> something like that
[02:25:22] <tcpman> uskerine: how would i set the switch digit
[02:25:41] <uskerine> you would call a function with the number you want to display
[02:25:54] <uskerine> then there would be a switch(digit) sentence in the function
[02:26:09] <uskerine> and you would hardcode the .show() for the segments you want to enable for that particular digit
[02:26:19] <uskerine> it would be tedious but readable
[02:26:44] <uskerine> plus there is no way to bypass the BCD to 7-segment encoding, you have to implement the lookup table somewhere
[02:26:53] <uskerine> if possible I would try to name the segments from a to b
[02:27:02] <uskerine> and just use $('.a').show()
[02:27:19] <tcpman> BCD?
[02:28:08] <uskerine> forget the BCD stuff, that's how it is named in electronics (binary coded decimal)
[02:28:11] <uskerine> the NUMBER
[02:29:26] <tcpman> Oh right
[02:29:39] <uskerine> you have a number and you have to enable certain segments, a lookup table is required somewhere, I would implement it as a function if I were you
[02:29:47] <uskerine> but probably there are more than one solutions
[02:29:52] <uskerine> solution*
[02:30:39] <tcpman> wow
[02:30:54] <uskerine> and if you manage to name or assign a class to the segments
[02:31:01] <uskerine> you don't even have to think which segments to show or hide
[02:31:02] <uskerine> http://www.interfacebus.com/BCD-to-7-Segment-Decoder-True-Table-function.jpg
[02:31:08] <uskerine> it is already done for you
[02:31:21] <uskerine> A-G are the 7 digit segments
[02:31:26] <uskerine> and on the left you have the number to display
[02:33:17] <tcpman> i like it.. but i don't have a clue how to implement that.. but if it saves time i guess i should look into it
[02:33:36] <uskerine> try to assign a class to each segment in the HTML
[02:33:43] <uskerine> naming them from A to G
[02:33:45] <uskerine> as in this figure:
[02:34:00] <uskerine> http://d1gsvnjtkwr6dd.cloudfront.net/large/IC-HCF4511BEY_02_LRG.jpg
[02:34:05] <uskerine> then program a function(number)
[02:34:09] <uskerine> with a switch(number)
[02:34:29] <uskerine> and for each number a case that will do:
[02:34:38] <uskerine> $('.a').show()
[02:34:45] <uskerine> $('.b').hide() etc
[02:34:50] <uskerine> and you are done
[02:35:07] <uskerine> you could probably also hide them all in the first sentence and then selectively show them
[02:35:12] <uskerine> depending on the number
[02:35:16] <tcpman> uskerine: only thing, in reality my segments are 3 per row of nine.. but they just look like 7
[02:35:38] <uskerine> ??
[02:36:17] <uskerine> so you don't have 7 segments
[02:36:20] <uskerine> you have more segments
[02:36:42] <uskerine> is that what you mean?
[02:36:56] <tcpman> http://pastebin.com/cUEhDr9T
[02:37:23] <tcpman> each segment is made of 3 tds
[02:37:57] <uskerine> but that at the end is a graphical representation of a number
[02:37:59] <uskerine> right?
[02:38:16] <uskerine> made out of individual segments
[02:38:39] <tcpman> sure
[02:39:40] <uskerine> so it is still the same method
[02:39:54] <uskerine> you just have to come up with your own coding
[02:39:59] <uskerine> if I were you I would do this:
[02:39:59] <uskerine> http://pastebin.com/u1fQyUYy
[02:40:06] <uskerine> and then implemente the function with the case
[02:40:19] <uskerine> and just $('.a').hide()   $('.b').show() etc
[02:40:22] <uskerine> for each number
[02:40:32] <uskerine> it will be easier to read
[02:40:51] <uskerine> there is no magic way of doing this, you need a lookup table somewhere
[02:41:22] <uskerine> *the function with the case=the function with the swtich(number) case 1: .... case 2: .... case 3: .... etc
[02:42:49] <uskerine> you could also code classes in each segment like digit1 digit2 digit3 etc
[02:43:00] <uskerine> and then do $('.digit1').show()
[02:43:05] <uskerine> but that's going to be a pain in the ass to code
[02:44:53] <frank_o> Hello! I got this minimal jQuery slideshow here -- but how do I make the 2nd and 3rd slide "slide in tandem" like the 1st and 2nd? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/eku4Lwt1/41/ (trying to avoid the flashing background during slide change)
[02:46:02] <tcpman> uskerine: ok im gonna have a go
[03:44:36] <fullhdpixel> Hello, is there a good jquery plugin/code snippets to scroll to page elements minus the navbar height?
[03:46:48] <fullhdpixel> Ah, found something that works well: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19127212/smooth-scroll-with-navbar-fixed-top
[03:48:46] <frank_o> fullhdpixel: What do you mean? Like Headroom.js?
[03:49:09] <fullhdpixel> the name suggests it's exactly what I need
[03:49:27] <fullhdpixel> no, it's not that
[03:49:45] <fullhdpixel> The thread I linked has the right code, it's fixed now :)
[04:15:12] <frank_o> Hi! How do I access `$(this)` inside a function in an `each` loop? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/jwrvt8ty/2/
[04:43:33] <sacho> var self = this and use self, or bind the function
[05:12:26] <CapnKernel> Hello folks.  I have an HTML form containing several fields (such as checkboxes, text fields, selects, and so forth.  Each field has an associated label tag, and the fields are within table rows.
[05:12:38] <CapnKernel> I'd like an event when I change anything editable within the form.
[05:12:47] <CapnKernel> At present I'm using $("#sillyform").change(), which almost does what I want, but unfortunately I'm also getting an event when a non-editable label is clicked on.
[05:12:53] <CapnKernel> How can I avoid getting events for the labels?
[05:22:19] <sangeight> just trying to understand, it is weird that you are getting a click event when you are simply listening to the change events?
[05:24:00] <CapnKernel> I'm a total jQuery newb
[05:24:12] <CapnKernel> In the event handler, I have an alert()
[05:24:36] <CapnKernel> The alert fires when I click on a checkbox, which is good.  And all of the other interactives in the form.
[05:24:48] <CapnKernel> But it also fires when I click on a text label
[05:25:04] <CapnKernel> And I'm definitely using change() not click()
[05:28:56] <shoky> CapnKernel but isn't clicking the label triggering a change of the linked <input> ?
[05:30:19] <CapnKernel> Ahh, sorry, I don't know enough to understand your question.
[05:30:39] <CapnKernel> Every interactive tag has a label.  Some of them are <input> some of them are other tags.
[05:30:51] <CapnKernel> I'm putting together a jsfiddle now
[05:30:59] <shoky> i mean, that's what <label>s are usually used for
[05:31:18] <shoky> so you can click the label text and have it trigger a change of the associated <input>
[05:32:19] <frank_o> For this minimal jQuery slideshow, does anybody know how to make the 2nd and 3rd image slide in tandem like the 1st and 2nd? Trying to avoid the flashing background during slide change: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/eku4Lwt1/41/
[05:32:32] <CapnKernel> Oh I see what you mean.  The labels are interactive in that they can change the state of the corresponding input
[05:33:05] <CapnKernel> Seems to happen only for checkboxes :-)
[05:33:16] <CapnKernel> Alright then, that I can accept! :-)
[05:33:18] <CapnKernel> Thanks for your help.
[05:33:23] <shoky> checkboxes and radios. and i think for text inputs it'd just focus the input
[05:33:29] <shoky> (and shouldnt trigger a change)
[05:33:42] <CapnKernel> My radios and text inputs don't cause the alert
[05:33:58] <CapnKernel> http://jsfiddle.net/beaxdskd/
[05:34:21] <shoky> well, they do
[05:34:42] <shoky> for me, at least..
[05:35:11] <CapnKernel> What happens when you click on the "Country" label?  Do you get an alert?
[05:35:26] <shoky> nope. as expected
[05:35:42] <CapnKernel> Ok, thanks.
[05:35:51] <shoky> oh you said "radios and text inputs"  thought you said radios and checkboxes
[05:37:14] <CapnKernel> :-)
[05:52:15] <CapnKernel> shoky: Do you know how I can find the node that changed?
[05:52:31] <CapnKernel> Within the change() handler, $(this) is giving me the form, not the control.
[05:53:32] <shoky> CapnKernel: event.target, where event is the argument passed to your callback, e.g.  $('form').change(function(e) { e.target })
[05:53:48] <CapnKernel> You're the best!
[05:53:56] <shoky> ;p
[05:54:06] <CapnKernel> Sigh, I hate being a newb.
[05:54:33] <CapnKernel> My business: Supplying these: http://i.imgur.com/gplpNwO.jpg
[05:54:56] <shoky> at least you're the good kind of newb. that asks good questions and not just spout "it not work"
[05:55:16] <CapnKernel> I can't expect good help if I don't ask a good question :-)
[05:55:20] <shoky> o you a circuit pusher
[05:55:33] <CapnKernel> My customers design them, I supply them.
[05:56:44] <shoky> solid plan
[05:56:45] <msg> China supplies them, and you take a fee
[05:56:50] <msg> :P
[05:58:01] <CapnKernel> I spent a lot of years learning Chinese, and developing relationships with suppliers.
[05:58:36] <shoky> hen hao
[05:58:53] <CapnKernel> Haha, strong is the Chinese in this one.
[05:59:00] <shoky> ;D
[05:59:17] <CapnKernel> I also have an IRC channel where my customers hang out.
[05:59:25] <CapnKernel> It's good fun.
[05:59:52] <CapnKernel> But there's just not enough hours in the day to learn all the things I'd like to.
[06:02:32] <Getty> CapnKernel: thats why we have several days in our life \o/
[06:04:21] <CapnKernel> days?  decades?
[06:06:36] <Getty> i do IT shit since i stopped using diapers and i still learn every day
[06:06:41] <Getty> i will _DIE_ learning that shit
[06:07:40] <CapnKernel> I know what you mean
[06:07:53] <CapnKernel> But I gotta assume the shit you're learning is not the shit from the diapers.
[06:08:00] <Getty> i hope you do, some dont, they forget this or never understand this
[06:08:14] <voronika> Why did you stop using the diapers?  It would make cube life easier.
[06:08:14] <Getty> hahahaha ;)
[06:08:19] <CapnKernel> When you cease to learn, it's form of death
[06:08:43] <CapnKernel> voronika: It depends
[06:08:44] <Getty> voronika: i am literally living the bed <=> computer dream without going to the cube... but dont bring up ideas for me ;) i might take them serious
[06:08:58] <Getty> CapnKernel: most of the IT scene is dead then ;)
[06:09:17] <CapnKernel> Getty: Great!  Sounds like an opportunity
[06:09:43] <Getty> CapnKernel: THEORETICAL.... yes...... PRACTICAL.... the bosses who hire still dont understand that
[06:10:07] <CapnKernel> My boss is an asshole
[06:10:11] <CapnKernel> Oh wait, it's me.
[06:10:26] <Getty> and how many people you hired yet?
[06:10:48] <CapnKernel> Getty: Well see the most important word in that sentence is "yet".  I'll get there.
[06:11:20] <CapnKernel> Or die trying.
[06:11:44] <Getty> yeah, i hope for you, as i am in the same situation, even tho i am already managing a team ;) but i still cant pay them
[06:12:11] <CapnKernel> Startup?
[06:12:20] <CapnKernel> Thanks for your kind thoughts.
[06:13:06] <Getty> i dont know if i want the word startup, i mean i am just doing stuff as i always do
[06:13:17] <CapnKernel> I desperately need people too.  I can't do this on my own.  But I have no money to pay them, and haven't found anyone yet who is into this, available, and would accept equity.
[06:13:23] <CapnKernel> Oh
[06:13:26] <Getty> and just since 4 years i am freelancer, before that i was always my own boss as no company was able to "command" me at all (and i made 90% of the work)
[06:13:36] <Getty> but _NOW_ i start my own products
[06:13:40] <Getty> so it gets pretty interesting now
[06:13:49] <Getty> "all in" as the poker guy would say
[06:13:51] <CapnKernel> I hope it goes well for you
[06:13:55] <CapnKernel> Yeah
[06:13:59] <Getty> ask me in a week
[06:14:09] <CapnKernel> I'm tired of 16 hour days though, 7 days a week
[06:14:11] <Getty> in 6 days the public presentation is on
[06:14:20] <Getty> tomorrow i get the prototype (hopefully)
[06:14:24] <Getty> and the software is not done yet
[06:14:26] <Getty> BUT I AM FINE
[06:14:49] <CapnKernel> All the best for that.
[06:14:55] <Getty> actually i ddint started the software of the device at all yet, still workig on the man webpage
[06:15:07] <Getty> the good part is i just need showcase quality, we then take 4 weeks till first deliveries
[06:15:13] <Getty> so ..... thats all _really_ cool
[06:15:30] <Getty> s/man/main/ damn tobacco on the keyboard
[06:17:08] <krambiorix> is it possible to catch the event of opening a browser download popup?
[06:18:23] <Getty> krambiorix: good question, never thought about it, see!!!! again something learned ;-)
[06:19:41] <krambiorix> Getty, you didn't learn yet. We don't have a solution :)
[06:20:00] <Getty> good point, but we will have it, and i will just suck it up ;-)
[06:20:14] <Getty> we talked before about how we have to learn in IT every day and that we will die learning
[06:20:34] <Getty> so your enlightened question was supportive to prove the point ;)
[06:25:01] <FernandoBasso> frank_o: Did you solve the slider problem?
[06:25:24] <krambiorix> Getty , i'm very happy that i can help you in this eternal process.
[06:26:32] <Getty> krambiorix: the beauty is that you learn from stupid and intelligent people, so its not really an accomplishment ;) thans nevertheless
[06:26:36] <Getty> thanks
[06:41:15] <krambiorix> Getty,  there are no stupid people, only stupid questions :)
[06:41:29] <krambiorix> and even that is discussable
[06:41:38] <Getty> krambiorix: there are stupid people, A LOT..... all those who stopped learning
[06:41:56] <Getty> those are the scumbags of our society and they are in majority
[06:42:23] <krambiorix> most of them are just lazy
[06:42:24] <Getty> so actually i would even say: there are stupid people but not stupid question, cause if you ask you are already out of stupidity
[06:42:55] <krambiorix> Getty, i just was telling what society learns us :p
[06:42:59] <Getty> but you can ask a question which is based on your stupidity (laziness)..... whih then is a stupid question but its not cause of the question then ;)
[06:43:01] <Getty> IT GETS COMPLEX
[06:43:18] <Getty> &-)

[07:21:55] <Laire> and tha remove all css classes too, because the remove from the data-position int enough
[07:22:41] <systemfault> Remove the class attribute the same way I showed you how to remove the data-position one.
[07:25:27] <Laire> sad that isn't easier ;-)
[07:42:35] <decx> well your approach is bad

[07:54:34] <John3k> i would like to add a class="" to each <option> element, so <option class="xyz"> , but how do i do that?

[09:13:11] <Prometheian> I'm trying to iterate through an item list I'm getting from an api call and then apply using knockout but while I think I have the right idea, my code isn't pulling more then one item. I'm unsure how to go about this. http://www.hastebin.com/obupemopen.xml
[09:13:33] <Prometheian> Well it's pulling all the items but only binding the first.
[09:18:39] <Prometheian> tl;dr I need to get two elements for each item in an array and bind them with knockout.
[09:39:38] <uskerine> does anyone know if datatables can refer cells (as in   .cell(row,4)    ) by its name defined in "columnDefs" (with "name":   "cellName" )?

[10:09:32] <darpan> I am using pivottable.js of jquery. On drag-and-drop the inputs to the available divs, we get the table rendered simulatenously. So we downloaded the plugin and used "pivotUI loaded from CSV". The problem is how am i suppose to fetch the rendered data to be used further in my d3 visualisation.
[10:16:17] <uskerine> should this 'span[name="foo"].closest("td")'    select the closest "td" element which is parent of <span name="foo"> ?
[10:25:33] <uskerine> http://jsfiddle.net/0keewq1e/1/
[10:25:37] <uskerine> any help welcomed
[10:25:48] <uskerine> I would like to toggle <td> which contains <span name="foo">
[10:26:43] <uskerine> <td>'s will be generated dynamically, so event delegation is required

[10:51:03] <frank_o> FernandoBasso: Hey!
[10:51:07] <frank_o> FernandoBasso: Nope not yet
[11:07:55] <FernandoBasso> frank_o: You wante to stop the slider after the image tree was shown?
[11:22:11] <uskerine> http://jsfiddle.net/0keewq1e/5/
[11:22:13] <uskerine> I'll try it again
[11:22:30] <uskerine> anyone helping me to toggle 'td's that contain <span name="foo">
[11:22:31] <uskerine> ?
[11:24:21] <decx> the hell is :parent
[11:26:25] <uskerine> http://jsfiddle.net/0keewq1e/7/
[11:26:33] <uskerine> I am not even getting up to the point where parent is recognized
[11:27:50] <uskerine> it seems that it only works if you click in the <span> element
[11:28:33] <frank_o> FernandoBasso: allow me to reiterate:
[11:28:52] <frank_o> For this minimal jQuery slideshow, does anybody know how to make the 2nd and 3rd image slide in tandem like the 1st and 2nd one? Trying to avoid the flashing background during slide change: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/eku4Lwt1/41/
[11:35:37] <uskerine> decx can't get :parent working, any further tip or help is welcomed
[11:38:37] <uskerine> I figured it out, fixed with .has()
[11:40:05] <decx> switch the logic around uskerine
[11:40:25] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/0keewq1e/8/
[11:46:59] <FernandoBasso> frank_o: What do you mean by 'flashing background'?
[12:07:31] <Prometheian> I'm having trouble binding some JSON data I get from an ajax call into a knockout object. I only want two elements from each item returned and then I want them placed into a foreach table. But can't get my syntax to play right.
[12:17:44] <shoky> Prometheian: http://www.hastebin.com/bizorocone.js would work. ask in #knockoutjs if you need further help
[12:18:37] <Prometheian> Did not know of the knockout channel, and I'll give that code a shot, ty!
[12:18:44] <shoky> note that if you call that function multiple times, to update the view, then it's the wrong approach
[12:19:08] <shoky> if it's just once on load or something then it's fine
[12:19:45] <Prometheian> It'll just be once on load. Ty!
[12:20:24] <shoky> np
[12:34:39] <floer_9> can i do this with an input type submit? http://jsfiddle.net/deC37/
[12:38:23] <jeffreylevesque> how do i create an inline object - {}?
[12:38:24] <jeffreylevesque> for purposes of passing to another function
[12:41:42] <shoky> {}
[12:43:26] <darpan> hello
[12:50:05] <uskerine> decx I finally did this: http://jsfiddle.net/0keewq1e/10/
[12:58:14] <frank_o> FernandoBasso: Hello
[12:58:56] <frank_o> FernandoBasso: just that there's this big gap between the 2nd and 3rd slide, so that the white background behind it is exposed
[13:20:12] <FernandoBasso> frank_o: I changed it a little bit, but the problem then is after the last image is show... http://jsfiddle.net/eku4Lwt1/43/
[13:21:26] <WillPittenger> I'm trying to get JQuery 1.11.1 working with Scriptish (Greasemonkey fork) in Firefox.  Scratchpad keeps telling me that $ isn't a valid function.  I'm at a loss as to why.  I have the relevant @require line present.  Any ideas?
[13:22:42] <WillPittenger> Replacing the $ with jquery doesn't help.
[13:23:41] <frank_o> FernandoBasso: Yeah, ideally all images should slide "together" like the 1st and 2nd image in the original fiddle
[13:24:17] <frank_o> Looks a bit problematic, but I think it's better this way rather than including all of say https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/
[13:24:38] <FernandoBasso> Agreed.
[13:24:50] <floer_9> can i do this with an input type submit? http://jsfiddle.net/deC37/
[13:24:55] <FernandoBasso> I never wrote sliders in js before, so...
[13:25:21] <tw2113> i have no reason to, everyone else but myself and FernandoBasso have already
[13:25:25] <tw2113> i'd just use one of theirs
[13:27:19] <dokma> when I paste more than about 65536 bytes into Chrome's textarea it just discards the data...

[19:25:33] <shoky> srikat: you can use event delegation, delegate the click handling to an ancestor element. http://jsfiddle.net/jrbzvkhr/12/   read about it in the docs for .on()
[19:29:26] <srikat> awesome, thank you.

[21:09:03] <Prometheian> I'm trying to make it so when you click on a link on my page, the window that is opened (on another domain), is opened in one of those cool floating div's that dim the background like facebook does their pictures. I'm not sure how to pull this off, and evidently don't know how to articulate it to google to get an answer.
[21:10:02] <voronika> you're wanting to open external links in a lightbox?
[21:10:12] <Prometheian> Yes, that.
[21:10:38] <Prometheian> Maybe I can pull the specific area out of the page I'm loading and only show that, or I may alter how I'm doing it later, but that's the thought atm
[21:11:53] <Prometheian> Can I even lightbox external urls?
[21:12:35] <Jattenalle> Prometheian, yes
[21:12:41] <Prometheian> Ah, excellent!
[21:12:46] <Jattenalle> lightbox iframe
[21:13:17] <Prometheian> Google found me this: http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/
[21:13:23] <Prometheian> Better/worse compared with lightbox?
[21:13:41] <Jattenalle> dunno, i've always used this http://www.shadowbox-js.com/ instead of lightbox
[21:13:49] <Jattenalle> lightbox have always seemed way too bloated for my taste
[21:14:38] <Prometheian> Should I go with base or jQuery?
[21:14:45] <Jattenalle> that's up to you
[21:14:52] <Jattenalle> if you're already using jquery, might as well use that as a base
[21:14:55] <Prometheian> kk!
[21:14:56] <Jattenalle> to make it nicer to interact with
[21:18:12] <Prometheian> This doesn't seem to be playing nice w/ my ko binding of my href.
[21:18:17] <Prometheian> Hmm
[21:36:35] <Prometheian> I can't get shadowbox to work off of this link.
[21:36:37] <Prometheian> :s
[21:48:07] <Prometheian> Okay it's opening the window
[21:48:10] <Prometheian> But nothing's loading in it
[21:50:37] <Prometheian> It thinks it's loading, but the page is black.

[23:08:38] <superlative14> ok got it.
[23:08:47] <superlative14> i have been using jquery mobile. it works great.
[23:08:57] <superlative14> i am designing an restaurant menu ordering for a cinema
[23:09:09] <superlative14> where they order food items, and it displays a total and they pay via credit card, off their mobile.
[23:09:48] <superlative14> i am displaying the items with a listview which has a photo of the food item, and price.
[23:10:26] <superlative14> how would you recommend to use a form component that is + or minus with a quantity.
[23:10:41] <superlative14> and it cretaes a hidden form field with a talley of qty and item_id and price
[23:11:47] <superlative14> this is what i have with jquery mobile for the product display:
[23:11:49] <superlative14> <ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
[23:11:50] <superlative14>     <li><a href="#">
[23:11:50] <superlative14>         <img src="/prod1.png">

[23:12:04] <Cork> sigh
[23:12:46] <popl> Hey, is there some quirks with handling anchor tags in jquery?
[23:14:46] <popl> I have a class consisting (currently) of five anchor tags, and I am trying to register .click() callbacks for each of them with map but instead of setting the callback, .click() ends up being called.
[23:15:16] <popl> so my page is refreshed (href="") and it is frustrating
[23:20:47] <popl> failing that, what's a good method for pagination?
[23:24:58] <sammych> suppose I have this bit of code (render user textarea to HTML) http://jsbin.com/duzit/1/
[23:25:27] <sammych> how would I do effectively the same thing but in RhinoJS
[23:25:31] <sammych> well, Rhino
[23:25:37] <sammych> which doesn't have a document model
[23:35:39] <sammych> never mind. that's not safe enough.
[23:36:48] <popl> https://gist.github.com/popl/bdf891494bfc475e4063 # My code explaining what I'm trying to do, map a click handler to a class of anchor tags
[23:37:31] <popl> If I display the id of each item there, I can see link_0, link_1, et al.
[23:38:41] <popl> (so I know that I am selecting the correct elements, I mean)
