[00:18:37] <laughinghan> so I'm trying to understand how the master vs compat branches work, and similarly 1.x-stable vs 2.x-stable
[00:18:48] <laughinghan> I've tried to find it in blogposts or docs and I can't
[00:19:34] <laughinghan> are they long-running parallel branches, with features and fixes separately merged into each?
[00:19:59] <rcyr> It's simple. Both 1.x and 2.x are developed at the same time (Same featureset)
[00:20:08] <laughinghan> is one typically ahead of the other, like, is compat typically master+fixes
[00:20:16] <rcyr> 2.x is IE9+ while 1.x is for older browsers
[00:20:19] <laughinghan> I mean, master+compat patches
[00:20:41] <laughinghan> so when a new feature or fix is added, it's merged into master, and then master is merged into compat?
[00:20:52] <rcyr> I don't even know what compat is.
[00:20:59] <laughinghan> rcyr: I got that part, I'm trying to understand under-the-hood what your workflow is
[00:21:11] <laughinghan> it's one of the branches: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/compat
[00:21:18] <laughinghan> I assume it's the branch targeting jQuery Compat 3.x
[00:21:23] <rcyr> I guess you really need to speak to a jQuery dev.
[00:21:32] <laughinghan> haha yeah
[00:21:36] <rcyr> :)
[00:21:58] <huck5> I'm working on a UI that has a jQuery Mobile panel for a left-hand menu. It has `data-display="overlay"`, but when the panel is expanded, additional content (equal to the width of the panel) is created on the right-side page. Any common reasons this could be occuring?
[00:22:18] <laughinghan> I'm asking because I'm thinking of forking my own JS library in a similar way, a evergreen-browsers-only master branch and a legacy-browser-compatible fork
[00:22:46] <laughinghan> and I'm curious what the workflow jQuery uses to solve their similar problem is, and how well it works and what ways it doesn't
[00:23:44] <laughinghan> huck5: additional content is created? by jQuery Mobile?
[00:24:03] <huck5> laughinghan, Oh I'm not sure that it's jQMobile doing it, I guess. That was just my first place to start looking.
[00:24:28] <laughinghan> what do you mean by additional content is created?
[00:24:37] <laughinghan> like lorem ipsum is inserted?
[00:24:38] <huck5> Basically some empty-content appears, and an x-scrollbar appears when the menu is open.
[00:24:55] <laughinghan> a span, or a div, or something?
[00:24:59] <huck5> good question, one moment
[00:25:23] <laughinghan> can you identify what unexpected DOM operation is happening?
[00:25:56] <huck5> laughinghan, I can't really "inspect" the area - when I try and click on it, the menu collapses, and it dissappears.
[00:26:17] <laughinghan> if you pull up the developer tools with a shortcut
[00:26:22] <laughinghan> there's a little thingy
[00:26:26] <huck5> to click it, yeah
[00:26:46] <laughinghan> magnifying glass, left edge of the bar
[00:27:06] <laughinghan> click it and it goes from gray to blue, and you can select elements to inspect; afaik it doesn't send any events to the element?
[00:28:47] <huck5> laughinghan, well it appears to be part of the main content div.
[00:29:21] <huck5> laughinghan, it looks like it's just pushing the main-content dive to "the right" an amount equal to the width of the side-panel.
[00:29:36] <huck5> There's a top nav-menu that is not effected, but my main-page contents are...
[00:30:06] <huck5> Maybe the main content div needs to have class/property "container", or something? Could it be that it's not jQuery Mobile-ified?
[00:30:14] <laughinghan> I don't suppose you could temporarily expose this page with ngrok or something so I could see?
[00:30:51] <huck5> laughinghan, hm. I'm not sure what ngrok is, really. Shoot.
[00:30:58] <laughinghan> https://ngrok.com/
[00:31:03] <huck5> Thanks
[00:31:07] <laughinghan> it's pretty ingenious
[00:31:25] <huck5> Oh hey, that looks like a great tool! Much safer than giving access to a staging server.
[00:31:36] <laughinghan> haha totally
[00:32:38] <huck5> I guess I could start working backwards, and try and create a jsfiddle that has same behavior, too. By the time i recreate it I should have isolated the issue :P
[00:33:11] <laughinghan> fair enough
[00:36:02] <huck5> laughinghan, ah, after setting it up, I'm not sure I feel comfortable exposing the software over ngrok. So I shall try not to bother you further - and I appreciate your suggestions!
[00:36:13] <laughinghan> good luck!
[00:36:23] <laughinghan> hope at least the Dev Tools tip was helpful
[00:36:25] <huck5> Thanks! And also for exposing me to ngrok. Seems like a fantastic tool
[00:36:31] <laughinghan> yeah, it's dope
[01:03:18] <huck5> laughinghan, well after some parousing, it apperas that no <div> on the page has a `data-role="content"`. That is pretty suspect, is it not?
[01:03:42] <laughinghan> haha, sure
[01:03:48] <laughinghan> I don't actually know anything about jQuery Mobile
[01:04:08] <huck5> Haha, fair enough!
[01:04:47] <huck5> You seem fairly knowledgable about web-debuggers though. What about in Firefox debugger (not firebug), do you know how to `find by` an elements data-attribute?
[01:05:27] <laughinghan> you could query for it in the console?
[01:05:38] <huck5> Yep, that's what I ended up doing, thanks!
[01:05:41] <laughinghan> (based on my general knowledge of debuggers, not anything firefox-specific)
[01:05:48] <laughinghan> :) no prob
[01:06:13] <huck5> I feel like Saturday night may not be the most appropriate time to be doing this. And happy new year to everyone here!
[01:07:11] <laughinghan> heh, happy new year
[01:42:56] <dopie> Hey all how do i wrap a ! around this

[06:14:12] <cetabio2> hi
[06:19:30] <cetabio2> need help making a dynamic dropdown
[06:39:39] <user_cor_> I have a function (facebook JS SDK login) that I am calling through a form's "onSubmit": http://pastie.org/10667355 and I am trying to "return: true;" AFTER the user has logged in: http://pastie.org/10667350#8 My problem is that the form action gets executed right away. I'm at a loss because that part of the script is a simple if/else statement for determining if the user has logged in or not. Is there any way that jquery can possibly

[08:55:31] <mcfdez87> Hello. I have a string that is  a json array with some data. I need to transform this string to a form. What ways I have to acomplish this? (for read the json and print html depending of their content)
[09:27:31] <WhirledPress> Hey all, I want to create a generic object that automatically updates its id based on the element it is added to using jquery? Any suggestions?
[09:28:37] <WhirledPress> sorry, after reading that, I realized it made little sense.
[09:29:44] <WhirledPress> I am creating a test that has groups of questions with possible answers like "never","sometimes","always". I want to automate the html part of it, so radio buttons for each are added after every question.
[09:30:57] <WhirledPress> I was hoping to add an anonymous function to a prebuilt jquery object that I could append to each question li item that would figure out it's relative id
[09:37:48] * WhirledPress guesses jquery is yesterday's news..missed it again.
[10:14:31] <marrenarre> WhirledPress: Something like: $(elements).each(function(i) { this.id = i; })
[10:51:56] <MaxPen> can someone help me wrap a span around the date? https://jsfiddle.net/master412160/7y9x7594/

[11:53:48] <sasha> Hey guys, is using the .load() method to load modal content considered to be a bad practice?
[11:54:28] <sasha> In my case I have a bunch of different ordering modals, I'm trying out a bunch of different methods to get them to work, but none of them work reliably unfortunately
[11:54:58] <sasha> So - I was thinking of generating a page for each ordering modal, and loading it into the main page via load
[11:55:01] <sasha> What do you guys think?
[11:56:12] <unrecited> think im slackin smh
[12:39:55] <jquery865> test
[12:45:45] <MaxPen> so can anyone help me here?
[12:46:25] <Salgat> Not if you don't provide any information
[12:46:29] <MaxPen> well
[12:46:40] <MaxPen> I wish to wrap a date that has no tags around it with a span
[12:46:46] <MaxPen> see= https://jsfiddle.net/master412160/7y9x7594/
[12:58:45] <Salgat> try this https://jsfiddle.net/gsdamnnn/
[13:02:42] <MaxPen> perfect Salgat!
[13:02:44] <MaxPen> thank you!
[13:03:08] <Salgat> Np, I got it from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6925088/get-the-text-after-span-element-using-jquery ^^
[13:03:17] <unnotused> anyone know a good formbuilder ?
[13:04:01] <unnotused> like a gui for users to make forms
[13:04:19] <unnotused> im starting to think that there isn't one
[13:06:12] <arc_> what you really need is a gui to manipulate columns in your grid system. a form builder is going to make assumptions about how you want to lay things out
[13:06:59] <arc_> so .. i'm pretty confident that unfortunately what you want doesn't really exist
[13:45:41] <sergey_> Does someone know open source slider that looks like this http://joxi.ru/eAO6OeNS4pR012  (on top of https://gaming.youtube.com/)?
[13:50:40] <MaxPen> also no need to cover timezones, this are done by the server
[13:50:49] <MaxPen> https://jsfiddle.net/master412160/7y9x7594/9/
[13:53:05] <MaxPen> can someone help me get the date to display as x time ago? I am almost there but not yet
[13:57:06] <MaxPen> anyone here fellas?
[14:00:51] <Salgat> I don't think using date to store the time ago is right. https://jsfiddle.net/1yLnrqtp/ I just copied from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1787939/check-time-difference-in-javascript
[14:01:23] <Salgat> Btw I like your  var date = br.prop("nextSibling"); line, much more clean
[14:03:10] <MaxPen> ah Salgat thank you
[14:04:14] <MaxPen> but the date doesn't change? I do see in the console log the output
[14:08:55] <Salgat> yeah you'll still need to change it using something like $('.date').text(get_time_diff(new Date(date.textContent)) + " Ago");
[14:09:15] <Salgat> although I'd use a better selector than .date
[14:10:53] <MaxPen> maybe I should use that timeago plugin instead?
[14:11:34] <MaxPen> because that outputs as 53 Days 4 Hours 31 Minutes 29 Seconds Ago which is not per say what the goal is
[14:14:25] <diegoviola> hi
[14:14:54] <Salgat> Are you just trying to give approximate "Ago"? You could just make it conditional, such as if days > 0, return days else if hours > 0, return hours, etc
[14:15:19] <diegoviola> I'm using the chartkick.js for my charts and I'm trying to update the chart via ajax, I don't know what I'm doing wrong though that when I call .html() or .empty().append() I get nothing back, but on success I seem to get the json back from the server, here's my code: https://gist.github.com/diegoviola/9183b7fde62f7393aa6e
[14:15:29] <diegoviola> could you guys tell me what I'm doing wrong here?
[14:16:41] <diegoviola> login_update is where I receive the json for updating the chart
[14:17:12] <Salgat> but yeah I'd just use the timeago plugin if you want something that just works (which is probably better)
[14:18:02] <MaxPen> but this doesn't seem that straight forward to achive
[14:18:23] <MaxPen> I do thank you from the bottom of my heart for your assistance in this matter
[14:18:29] <MaxPen> we might have been close
[14:18:35] <diegoviola> any ideas?
[14:19:09] <MaxPen> I know its often best to try it on your own without a plugin
[14:21:42] <diegoviola> I think I found the issue
[14:22:40] <Salgat> do you mean something like https://jsfiddle.net/a2ybe1tg/ otherwise I'm not sure I understand what is needed haha
[14:23:13] <diegoviola> f*ck yeah!
[14:23:16] <diegoviola> it works
[14:23:20] <diegoviola> the hash I was returning was wrong
[14:23:38] <Salgat> what was your fix?
[14:24:01] <MaxPen> yeah Salgat that I meant
[14:24:07] <MaxPen> and can we do months ago too?
[14:24:14] <MaxPen> and years ago
[14:25:31] <diegoviola> Salgat: I was returning the wrong data
[14:25:36] <diegoviola> from the server
[14:25:38] <diegoviola> I was doing:
[14:25:45] <diegoviola> render json: Measurement.where(created_at: start_date..end_date).to_json
[14:25:48] <diegoviola> I had to do:
[14:25:55] <diegoviola> render json: Measurement.where(code: 'login_interval').where(created_at: start_date..end_date).group(:created_at).sum(:value).to_json
[14:26:09] <diegoviola> forgot about it
[14:26:34] <diegoviola> forgot I have login_interval and report_interval on that same model
[14:28:29] <Salgat> that depends, if you just want approximate, you can do something like https://jsfiddle.net/9fmv05eo/ although at that point to get perfect you'd have to determine which month it is, how many days in each month, etc
[14:28:53] <diegoviola> I still don't know I want to do empty().append() though
[14:28:57] <diegoviola> seems error prone
[14:29:00] <diegoviola> isn't there something better?
[14:30:02] <Salgat> interesting
[14:30:49] <MaxPen> thank you Salgat
[14:39:32] <MaxPen> Salgat I have an other issue
[14:40:02] <MaxPen> I have like in the fiddle you see multiple rows with similiar data, it is from a forum script
[14:40:10] <MaxPen> however when I try to set the date as as a title
[14:40:17] <MaxPen> it fetches all the dates and injects them in the title
[14:40:23] <MaxPen> not just the one needed
[14:41:10] <MaxPen> var title = $(".date").closest().text();     $(".date").attr("title", title);
[14:47:26] <islalobo> Hello, how can I have a jquery alert pop up based on response from api callback?
[15:36:33] <mcfdez87> Hello. I'm trying to render some fiels inside form trought an ajax json response, but not get result. Any suggestion please? https://jsfiddle.net/tyvag5yy/
[15:36:42] <mcfdez87> (line 23)
[15:44:10] <shoky_> mcfdez87: should be dataType not datatype.  and if it's json you should use dataType: 'json'  and then you don't need to call parseJSON.  also on line 23 it seems you have =+ instead of +=   but you're adding to undefined, because you didn't initialize fields to ''
[15:46:26] <mcfdez87> shoky_, ok, was the =+ to +=
[15:46:44] <mcfdez87> thanks
[16:19:05] <clearcut> I would like to create accordion menu like this - i need this line connected between elements which can be collapsed: http://i.imgur.com/n8aXLo0.png - anyone know any good jqeury/css/js plugins to achieve this?
[16:47:15] <flai3> Hey guys, api.jquery.com describes which version of jquery?
[16:47:55] <flai3> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/blob/master/entries/jQuery.ajax.xml#L88 This describes the "error" jqXHR-class
[16:48:09] <flai3> * the error property of the jqXHR-class
[16:48:49] <flai3> However, looking at the source-code of jquery this is wrong, as it should be the same as the fail-propery both in 1.1 and 2.2
[16:49:19] <flai3> (https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.12-stable/src/ajax.js#L520 for 1.12 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/2.2-stable/src/ajax.js#L518 for 2.2)
[16:49:46] <flai3> Is the API-doc wrong or is api.jquery.com for the 3.0.0-release?
[16:57:07] <wontoner> hey there is a site for learning jquery that has scores and quizzes, an interactive console and tutorial videos. Does anyone know what i'm talking about?
[16:57:34] <wontoner> i can't find my bookmark for it. i thought it was linked off the jquery site but i dont see it.
[17:00:17] <shoky_> wontoner: maybe this?  http://try.jquery.com/
[17:01:22] <wontoner> shoky_: yes that is the one! thank you so much.
[17:03:37] <shoky_> flai3: i didn't understand what you say the issue is
[17:05:54] <shoky_> flai3: btw that line in the code  jqXHR.error = jqXHR.fail   is not about the "error" option, it's about a deprecated .error method on the returned jqXHR object.  the api doc you linked is about the "error" option, not the .error property of the jqXHR
[17:06:50] <shoky_> flai3: look for .error here  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[18:01:22] <user_corrupt> I have the following form: http://pastie.org/10668532#27,42 submitting via AJAX when 1 of 2 buttons are clicked.. each button has a different value.. here is where the JS grabs said value: http://pastie.org/10668533#11 my problem is that it always grabs the value from the same button (the first) as opposed to the one that was necessarily clicked. How might I rectify this?
[19:35:59] <Scarecr0w> Good evening.. might sound selfish to ask a question with a greeting. Sorry
[19:36:11] <Scarecr0w> Anyone experienced with Masonry?
[20:12:45] <stig_> question: I am injecting a new div into a page after the page loads (on button click). In that div, I have a form that I would like to submit using javascript and prevent default function. However, it seems that jquery & javascript can't find that element because it only exists after page load. How can I do this?
[20:13:08] <stig_> I have the following, however it does nothing other than prevent the default function of the button
[20:13:28] <stig_> $('body').on('click', '#submitPassword', function(e){  e.preventDefault(); }).submit();
[20:23:49] <shoky_> stig_: to prevent a submit event you need to do .preventDefault() on the <form>'s submit event, not a button click event.  also what is that .submit(); at the end doing there
[20:23:59] <shoky_> (that's doing  $('body').submit() )
[20:26:36] <stig_> I'm trying to submit the form using jquery
[20:27:03] <stig_> if the form is not injected after the page loads, I can do $('#form').submit();
[20:27:11] <shoky_> then you'd need to call .submit() on the form, not on $('body')
[20:27:38] <stig_> how can I do that if the #form is not loaded on document.ready
[20:27:51] <stig_> it is injected into the html when a user clicks a button (eg. edit user details)
[20:27:56] <shoky_> the same as you did for the button click event
[20:27:59] <shoky_> would work
[20:28:07] <shoky_> that's using event delegation
[20:28:19] <stig_> nope, it says e.submit() is not a valid function
[20:28:21] <shoky_> delegating the event handling to <body>
[20:28:29] <shoky_> who said e.submit() ?
[20:28:49] <stig_> thats how i prevented default
[20:28:49] <stig_> e.preventDefault();
[20:29:21] <shoky_> yes but you did it for a button click event, not a form submit event
[20:29:32] <shoky_> and donno what that has to do with e.submit()
[20:29:41] <shoky_> event objects don't have a submit() method
[20:30:15] <stig_> so if i do 'submit' instead of 'click' it will submit?
[20:30:37] <shoky_> didn't really understand if you want to submit.. or prevent a submit :)
[20:30:51] <shoky_> but to submit, you call .submit() on the form
[20:31:08] <stig_> I want to submit via javascript and prevent the page from reloading
[20:31:15] <stig_> sorry for the confusion!
[20:31:28] <shoky_> you want to do an ajax submit ?
[20:31:33] <stig_> yep
[20:31:55] <stig_> i want it to take the form elements and submit them
[20:32:04] <shoky_> anyways.. like i said.  you need the form's submit event,  not the button's click event
[20:32:15] <shoky_> and you need to call .submit() on the form to submit it
[20:32:40] <shoky_> but since you just wanna do an ajax call you can just do that, without any form submit/prevent going on
[20:32:52] <shoky_> though you could do it via a submit+prevent if you want.
[20:33:48] <stig_> my question then is how do i do the .submit()?
[20:34:02] <stig_> i already changed from click to submit event
[20:34:02] <shoky_> call .submit() on teh form
[20:34:28] <stig_> the form is not part of the DOM since it is loaded after the page loads, so I cannot call it
[20:34:37] <stig_> (#form).submit() does not exist
[20:34:42] <shoky_> call it after the form is part of the DOM
[20:34:54] <shoky_> that's when you want to submit it, afterall
[20:35:15] <stig_> let me try 1 sec
