[06:54:25] <Barrt> Hey people
[06:55:14] <Barrt> I'm trying to implement jQuery steps and jQuery validation and I can't make it work
[06:55:32] <Barrt> Is anyone around that could give me a hand?
[07:25:10] <Woet> Barrt: not without more information besides "I can't make it work"
[07:25:39] <Barrt> well
[07:27:13] <Barrt> Well I have the jQuery steps working, and oonStepChanging function should go the validation
[07:27:43] <Barrt> I've tried to setup the form validation there but I can't make it work in any way. :(
[07:28:01] <Barrt> Form.validate
[07:37:08] <Woet> Barrt: put your test case on jsfiddle.net
[13:59:38] <snackoverflow> what exactly does L18 and L22 do? https://bpa.st/HRQQ - I searched the entire javascript file for "rowadded" and "rowupdated", there are no references. whats going on?
[14:01:07] <robertmaxrees> snackoverflow please don't shotgun questions out to multiple channel ;) to answer your question - there's probably a plugin that uses those events.
[14:01:55] <snackoverflow> robertmaxrees: thanks!
[15:30:49] <snackoverflow> robertmaxrees: you were right
[15:30:55] <snackoverflow> robertmaxrees: but i have sort of the same issue
[15:31:20] <snackoverflow> robertmaxrees: i need to find where the data-id of each <tr> is set. https://bpa.st/62HQ
[15:31:25] <snackoverflow> can anyone help?
[15:35:37] <robertmaxrees> can you be more specific?
[15:36:13] <robertmaxrees> you just want to know which line in there is setting data-id?
[15:36:32] <robertmaxrees> snackoverflow
[15:47:06] <snackoverflow> robertmaxrees: yes
[15:47:55] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing anything in there set data-id
[15:48:34] <snackoverflow> robertmaxrees: neither do i :/ but data-id gets set
[15:48:49] <robertmaxrees> wait, this uses datatables.
[15:48:52] <robertmaxrees> that's probably where.
[15:49:38] <snackoverflow> oh
[15:50:06] <snackoverflow> robertmaxrees: data-id is automatically set by datatables?
[15:50:15] <snackoverflow> or it's set manually using datatables?
[15:50:25] <robertmaxrees> no clue.
[15:50:38] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to check out datatables for more.  gonna guess it's automatic.
[15:53:25] <robertmaxrees> snackoverflow let's back up - what problem are you trying to solve?
[15:53:41] <snackoverflow> robertmaxrees: i want to set a data attr on each tr
[15:54:00] <snackoverflow> like data-identifier="my-identifier"
[15:54:10] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty easy to do.  what does the ID have to do with that?
[15:54:13] <robertmaxrees> *the data-id, that is.
[15:54:16] <funguy_23> his is this channel still active?
[15:54:22] <snackoverflow> robertmaxrees: so i can see where attributes are being set
[15:54:30] <robertmaxrees> snackoverflow ah - gotcha.
[15:54:39] <robertmaxrees> funguy_23 well, there are people in here talking, so... :)
[15:54:51] <snackoverflow> funguy_23: it's somewhat active
[15:55:07] <snackoverflow> it's not a party in las vegas
[15:55:19] <robertmaxrees> lol funguy_23 how can we help you?
[15:55:20] <snackoverflow> it's more like a somewhat popular city in wisconsin
[15:55:32] <funguy_23> robertmaxrees hi
[15:56:21] <snackoverflow> robertmaxrees: have any ideas for my problem?
[15:56:46] <robertmaxrees> snackoverflow check the datatables docs and see what their api is for interacting with rows.
[15:57:04] <funguy_23> how does vuejs/react compare to jquery?
[15:57:14] <robertmaxrees> funguy_23 they solve different problems.
[15:57:28] <robertmaxrees> vue/react are frameworks for building applications.  jquery is a DOM abstraction library.
[15:57:41] <robertmaxrees> not really comparable.
[15:57:47] <funguy_23> you use react and jquery together? i see thanks
[15:57:52] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:58:00] <robertmaxrees> if you use react, do not use jquery.
[15:58:16] <robertmaxrees> you don't need it in that case - react replaces all other tooling you'd use client-side.
[15:59:39] <robertmaxrees> funguy_23
[16:02:02] <funguy_23> hi
[16:02:07] <robertmaxrees> ... lol
[16:10:11] <snackoverflow> robertmaxrees: data-id is not set by datatables
[16:10:17] <robertmaxrees> where's it set?
[16:12:48] <snackoverflow> robertmaxrees: idk but i know its not set by datatables
[16:13:04] <snackoverflow> robertmaxrees: the id is based off of an object called area
[16:13:05] <robertmaxrees> how do you know?
[16:13:25] <snackoverflow> see L130
[16:13:32] <robertmaxrees> link again?
[16:15:29] <snackoverflow> robertmaxrees: https://bpa.st/62HQ
[16:16:54] <robertmaxrees> that's not setting anything.
[16:16:56] <robertmaxrees> that's selecting it.
[16:19:17] <snackoverflow> robertmaxrees: i know...
[16:19:33] <snackoverflow> robertmaxrees: its based off of area_id
[16:19:36] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:19:48] <snackoverflow> it isnt arbitrary
[16:19:59] <snackoverflow> its actually based on a real object
[16:20:11] <robertmaxrees> i never said it was arbitrary... lol
[16:22:33] <snackoverflow> robertmaxrees: an example of tr data ids in order: 6, 3, 2, 4
[16:22:38] <snackoverflow> not 1,2,3,4
[16:22:40] <robertmaxrees> ok?
[16:22:42] <robertmaxrees> lol brb
[16:23:01] <\Kalascus> To remove the last two columns of a table, should I just do this twice or is there a better way?
[16:23:02] <\Kalascus> $("th:last-child, td:last-child", "#table").remove()
[16:24:11] <snackoverflow> \Kalascus: use the `kittens` function
[16:25:07] <\Kalascus> Kittens?
[16:25:18] <snackoverflow> \Kalascus: yes
[16:25:41] <snackoverflow> : \o/
[16:25:46] <snackoverflow> :D
[16:25:59] <robertmaxrees> uh...
[16:26:01] <robertmaxrees> that's not a method...
[16:31:33] <\Kalascus> Would this be more or less efficient than the first way?
[16:31:33] <\Kalascus> $("th:nth-child(4), th:nth-child(5), td:nth-child(4), td:nth-child(5)", "#table").remove()
[16:31:47] <\Kalascus> For a table with ~10-10000 rows
[16:33:34] <robertmaxrees> lemme check.
[16:36:39] <robertmaxrees> just use .slice()
[16:36:56] <robertmaxrees> .slice(-2).remove()
[16:37:05] <robertmaxrees> or .filter() based on the heading text.
[19:26:06] <robertparkerx> how would I add <a class="skip-main" href="#main-home">Skip to main content</a> after opening body tag ?
[19:26:15] <robertparkerx> I tried innerHTML but that replaced it
[19:26:26] <robertparkerx> prepend and append don't see to go inside
[19:26:35] <robertparkerx> insertAfter is the same
[19:26:55] <robertmaxrees> $('body').prepend('<a>foo</a>') should work...
[19:27:34] <robertparkerx> okay maybe I forgot prepend
[19:27:42] <robertparkerx> lol
[19:27:48] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c5eqxLzo/
[19:27:49] <robertparkerx> it works
[19:27:53] <robertmaxrees> :)
