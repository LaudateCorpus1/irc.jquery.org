[00:02:46] <iYuri> here is what I would like to do
[00:03:24] <falieson> eddiemonge: do you have a tutorial on building a contact form you'd recommend?
[00:05:18] <iYuri> I need a sort of induced click event
[00:05:30] <iYuri> like: "behave like that item ad been clicked"
[00:06:43] <eddiemonge> iYuri: what is "toExec"? thats not a HTML element
[00:09:37] <eddiemonge> iYuri: i still dont know what toExec is but http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/qWDbw/
[00:16:16] <iYuri> eddiemonge: toExec is a sample id name
[00:16:32] <iYuri> it means that i have to call THAT click function
[00:16:35] <iYuri> from the other one
[00:17:31] <iYuri> using .click() it works like if I clicked on that link??
[00:18:36] <coldhead> this sounds very complicated
[00:21:21] <iYuri> does I have to write it as a function and simply call it?
[00:21:51] <iYuri> there's no way to invoke a click event from jquery?
[00:22:20] <coldhead> ?trigger @ iYuri
[00:22:20] <bot-t> iYuri, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[00:22:45] <coldhead> $('#lol').trigger('click');
[00:26:41] <iYuri> thank you, I'll use trigger! :)
[00:27:09] <skamikaze> or just call an empty click
[00:28:27] <Spadeski>  sup
[00:34:24] <sneakyness> is there any reason history.js would add a trailing slash when you click on anchors that href "#"?
[00:44:14] <coldhead> seriously, fuck all this
[00:44:24] <coldhead> i am going to work at burger kind
[00:44:26] <coldhead> king*
[00:53:40] <iYuri> lol
[00:55:04] <NodeX> at least at Burger King you can have it your way lol
[00:58:19] <sneakyness> coldhead: hey babygirl how u doin
[00:58:42] <coldhead> wishing i were dead
[00:59:41] <Axsuul> How would I do something like this? $(this + ':visible')
[00:59:52] <Axsuul> $(this).find(':visible') not working
[01:00:13] <aaronmcadam> if(  $(this).is(':visible') ) { ... }
[01:00:22] <Axsuul> any way to get an array though?
[01:00:27] <aaronmcadam> huh
[01:00:36] <Axsuul> oops nevermind
[01:00:37] <aaronmcadam> this will only be one element surely
[01:00:41] <Axsuul> yea
[01:00:43] <Axsuul> my bad
[01:00:44] <orl> Hi!
[01:01:07] <timing> Axsuul: $().filter(':visible');
[01:01:25] <timing> you want to filter the current set? or childs from the element
[01:01:37] <aaronmcadam> the element itself
[01:01:38] <Axsuul> I found my mistake, thanks
[01:01:40] <orl> When using $.ajax() the <audio> and <video>'s attr "preload" seems to be ignored, see here:
[01:01:50] <orl> www.sebkhachott.net/testNavJsVideo0.html
[01:02:13] <orl> the page which is called through $.ajax() is http://www.sebkahchott.net/deuxieme.html
[01:02:17] <orl> sorry
[01:02:25] <orl> www.sebkhachott.net/deuxieme.html
[01:02:58] <orl> if you load www.sebkhachott.net/deuxieme.html directly, no media is coming to your machine, whic is normal
[01:03:19] <orl> if you use the link (ajaxified) on www.sebkhachott.net/testNavJsVideo0.html, all the media incomes to your machine
[01:03:22] <NodeX> orl : your ajax request simply puts the response in the element you say
[01:03:38] <timing> orl: why the $(data) ? why not just data?
[01:03:38] <NodeX> it does not strip anything from it
[01:04:13] <orl> NodeX: that's waht I thought, but actually, it just turns preload to auto (or seems to)
[01:04:16] <skamikaze> Axsuul: http://jsfiddle.net/mjGLr/
[01:04:26] <NodeX> jquery doesn't do that
[01:04:33] <timing> orl: can you remove the $() ?
[01:04:39] <orl> timing: don't know, I guess it was the solution someone gave me here
[01:04:40] <orl> I can
[01:04:59] <orl> NodeX: I know it's pretty incredible, but actually, it's the only difference between those two ways to call that page
[01:05:02] <timing> there is not need to do that
[01:05:16] <timing> also, what does console.log(data); print?
[01:05:23] <NodeX> the browser -may- do it but jQuery certainly doesn't
[01:06:05] <NodeX> <audio tabindex="0" controls="controls" preload="none" ...
[01:06:06] <orl> NodeX: possible, but it happens on Safari as well as Firefox/iceweasel and chrome
[01:06:09] <orl> several versions
[01:06:30] <timing> orl: the ajax request isn't even fired here
[01:06:42] <NodeX> i can tell you for a fact jquery doesn't do it because I am inside <video> loading code right now that preloads
[01:06:53] <timing> O I have the click
[01:06:54] <timing> never mind
[01:07:12] <orl> timing: data instead of $(data) gives an error (as you might see by now)
[01:07:22] <NodeX> <audio src="spip/IMG/ogg/sebkha-chott._2006__nagah_mahdi_-_opuscrits_en_48_rouleaux.copyleft_lal1-3_.05-illusions__full_.ogg" preload="none" controls="" tabindex="0">
[01:07:22] <NodeX>  ... that';s teh response from the Ajax request
[01:07:40] <NodeX> <audio tabindex="0" controls="controls" preload="none" src="spip/IMG/ogg/sebkha-chott._2006__nagah_mahdi_-_opuscrits_en_48_rouleaux.copyleft_lal1-3_.05-illusions__full_.ogg"> </audio> <--- that is what's in the page
[01:07:55] <timing> orl: remove the html stuff
[01:08:12] <orl> timing: dataType, do you mean ?
[01:08:16] <timing> nope
[01:08:24] <timing> orl: the html in deuxieme.html should just be what nodeX says
[01:08:26] <orl> NodeX: I'm not sure to understand what you say (my limits)
[01:08:34] <sneakyness> coldhead: cheer up buttercup, it could be worse
[01:08:42] <NodeX> I said the response and what is inserted are identical
[01:08:59] <orl> NodeX: yes, that's what I've been checking too.
[01:09:17] <orl> Still, did you check with firebug in the "network" tab?
[01:09:23] <timing> orl: change deuxieme.html to: <audio src="spip/IMG/ogg/sebkha-chott._2006__nagah_mahdi_-_opuscrits_en_48_rouleaux.copyleft_lal1-3_.05-illusions__full_.ogg" preload="none" controls="" tabindex="0">
[01:09:36] <timing> skip everything else
[01:11:07] <NodeX> seems your web sevrer is serving byte range requests too
[01:11:31] <orl> timing: I can't, cause that page is a test because of a bug I experience on another website, and I need the full page to be called, because there is a processing upon a skeleton and the navigation should be available without jQuery
[01:11:50] <orl> I can do it for test case, but anyhow, it would have to revert like this in the end
[01:12:05] <orl> NodeX: what's byte range request?
[01:12:13] <orl> could it be linked to .htaccess, or something?
[01:12:33] <NodeX> dunno, I don't use apache it sucks ass
[01:12:55] <orl> Actually, I do observe the same behaviour on my (very crappy) home server (apache too), and on that distant one (ovh.com)
[01:12:57] <NodeX> open your response in a new tab and watch the net panel .. it chunks the .ogg over 4 partial files
[01:13:21] <orl> NodeX: by myself, in 6 parts
[01:13:34] <NodeX> 4 for me
[01:14:08] <orl> yes, I guess it depends on your browser, that's why I thought about that preload="auto" behaviour, which depends bnoth on the browser, connnexion, and so on.
[01:14:17] <timing> orl, NodeX: also, after insertion of the html, there are two elemtns called #vide
[01:14:28] <NodeX> lmfao
[01:14:52] <orl> timing: really? by myself, only one?
[01:15:10] <orl> NodeX: lmfao? (laugh my ass off?)
[01:16:06] <orl> timing: actually, I've built this page, really quickly, just to show the problem that I experience on a quite bigger website, so I might have missed some things, but the main problem is there, still.
[01:16:40] <timing> hmm
[01:17:16] <ianb_> Hey anyone online who could help with a jquery dialog issue?
[01:17:22] <orl> NodeX: do you also have #vide twice?
[01:17:58] <timing> and if you do this:   blabla.html( $(data).find('#vide').attr('id', 'videNeuf') );
[01:18:22] <NodeX> I am going to stab in the dark and say that preload attributes are preloaded after DOM ready / window load and seeing as your ajax doesn't have said event it is removing them
[01:18:36] <NodeX> I am checking the spec (which you shouldv'e done) to confirm
[01:19:48] <orl> timing: instead of the current $('#vide').html(chosetruc.closest()) ?
[01:20:10] <orl> NodeX: I've been checking several specs, and so on, but it's quite too high level for me, in that case
[01:20:33] <orl> NodeX: still your option sounds pretty possible to me.
[01:21:25] <orl> timing: http://www.sebkhachott.net/testNavJsVideo1.html
[01:21:55] <orl> (doesn't work, because of that parent thing with find (couldn't tell it to you here, but read some things about it, and finally got to use .closest)
[01:22:04] <NodeX> http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/video.html#dom-media-load
[01:22:59] <orl> NodeX: currently reading (and not understanding the whole thing!)
[01:26:08] <orl> NodeX: should I set readyState or networkState to something? It's really way above what I'm able to comprehend (and my original purposes were not so high!)
[01:26:37] <NodeX> it's outside the scope of this chan .. try #html5
[01:27:13] <orl> NodeX: you're right
[01:27:17] <orl> Thanks for your help, anyway
[01:28:35] <jita> I have a square box division, where i want to display the latest news of the site, scrolling horizontally. Whats the best plugin for that ?
[01:28:48] <jita> I mean vertically
[01:29:34] <zeppo> id use ariel fleslers serialscroll
[01:29:38] <zeppo> if you want to code it yourself
[01:33:22] <jita> zeppo: thanks
[02:00:52] <blazento> hi, anyone know why when i have an alert('') it trigger my hoverIntent triggers?
[02:01:26] <InDigital> hgi
[02:01:29] <InDigital> hi! :D
[02:02:06] <InDigital> i would like to know how can i stop file upload with JQuery hmm...
[02:02:22] <timing> xhr.abort(); ?
[02:02:29] <InDigital> i am using "jQuery Form Plugin"
[02:03:31] <NodeX> you cannot upload files with Jquery
[02:03:48] <NodeX> you cannot with any javascript in XMLhttprequest V1
[02:04:04] <InDigital> plugin uses hidden iframe
[02:04:32] <NodeX> do you want to stop the whole form being processed ?
[02:05:11] <InDigital> if is possible yes
[02:05:21] <sneakyness> I imagine "xhr" to be the sound of an old man coughing
[02:05:22] <InDigital> if it stops file uploading
[02:05:27] <sneakyness> "XHR! XHR XHRXHRXHR!"
[02:06:10] <InDigital> sneakyness lol
[02:06:14] <InDigital> :D
[02:06:24] <NodeX> $("#myform").submit(function(event){ event.preventDefautl()};
[02:06:32] <NodeX> $("#myform").submit(function(event){ event.preventDefault()};
[02:06:39] <blackspotwiggins> NodeX, you can upload files with xhr1
[02:06:39] <NodeX> that will stop it being sent
[02:06:48] <NodeX> No you cannot lol
[02:06:57] <blackspotwiggins> i have done just that..
[02:07:03] <InDigital> i think i am a noob :D
[02:07:14] <InDigital> NodeX how can i call this function on timer?
[02:07:19] <NodeX> not with Xmlhttprequest version 1 - javascript has no concept of files
[02:07:22] <NodeX> or binary data
[02:07:24] <InDigital> i know how to use timers..
[02:07:42] <NodeX> setTimer(function(){CODE IN HERE},1000)..
[02:07:48] <InDigital> yes
[02:07:49] <InDigital> so..
[02:07:58] <InDigital> eem.. my bad english :D
[02:08:11] <InDigital> so.. CODE would be?
[02:08:11] <blackspotwiggins> NodeX, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/File.getAsBinary
[02:08:24] <Deele> InDigital, just use popup html window, that gives user file upload ability
[02:08:27] <InDigital> this -> event.preventDefault()? :D
[02:08:45] <maela> hello
[02:09:09] <NodeX> never knew that .. still it's not cross browser so it's not relevant to me
[02:09:32] <blackspotwiggins> NodeX, dont spout bullshit about what's not possible or not and excuse it with not being relevant
[02:09:47] <NodeX> it's not relevant is it ?
[02:10:05] <InDigital> Deele popup window is not a good solution
[02:10:32] <InDigital> there lready is a hidden iframe (form plugin's iframe)
[02:10:56] <Deele> iframes should not be used anyway
[02:11:01] <shirmp> can i select elements like this: $("#parent#child").doSomething(); ?
[02:11:09] <maela> Hi, I have an event handler for one of my selects. Could anyone explain why $ is not defined when using a stand alone function for the handler, but is in when using an anonimous (inplace defined) function?
[02:11:36] <NodeX> shrimp : Id's are unique .. or need ot be so it's not ambiguous
[02:11:52] <Deele> shirmp, you can, just "#parent #child" or direct children "#parent > #child" bus as # is ID, you could not have two ID's in one DOM
[02:13:14] <Deele> I mean, you could, but that's wrong usage of ID's
[02:13:25] <michael_imac> I'm getting XMLHTTPRequest has no method error
[02:13:28] <blazento> if i had divs on my page that were above one another and each div was the full height of a screen, when i scroll down, is there anyway to say that "im on" a certain div?
[02:13:35] <michael_imac> I'm doing $.getJSON().error();
[02:13:38] <michael_imac> what's so wrong about that?
[02:13:38] <NodeX> just an FYI blackspotwiggins : it's not possible with XHRv1 ... It's possible in ONE brwser using XHRv1 making it completely relevant and non "Bullshit spouting"
[02:13:45] <Deele> michael_imac, for what code you get it?
[02:13:45] <michael_imac> hi NodeX
[02:13:56] <michael_imac> $.getJSON().error();
[02:13:56] <NodeX> howdee
[02:14:03] <michael_imac> good thanks :)
[02:14:11] <michael_imac> sort of...
[02:14:17] <michael_imac> hey Deele
[02:15:02] <blackspotwiggins> NodeX, https://gist.github.com/742267
[02:15:07] <blackspotwiggins> it's not only one browser
[02:15:30] <blackspotwiggins> there might be some way to do it in ie as well, not sure
[02:15:43] <Deele> michael_imac, part of code, you are trying to use, would be helpful
[02:16:44] <michael_imac> one srec
[02:17:01] <michael_imac> https://gist.github.com/fba95889171c4b217a86
[02:17:03] <michael_imac> rather terrible
[02:17:10] <Derppy> I'm cloning, modifying and appending a lot of stuff and then applying events to the clones. The events don't get applied. Is clone/append asynchronous and is it somehow possible the clones don't make it to the document before I apply the events?
[02:17:17] <michael_imac> got inline ruby in certain parts but it's working fine in development
[02:17:26] <michael_imac> although I didn't get a chance to test the .error()
[02:17:33] <quicksilver> Derppy: nope. clone/append is quite synchronous.
[02:17:49] <Derppy> quicksilver: Ok, thanks. Then it's about something else.
[02:19:40] <quicksilver> Derppy: you are using append, not appendTo?
[02:21:00] <InDigital> NodeX sorry if i disturbing you, .. so you know this "jQuery Form Plugin"?
[02:21:12] <Derppy> quicksilver: appendTo, the elements get modified and appended correctly, bug I guess there's something wrong with how I apply the events. Dealing with generated input names etc. so it's a mess.
[02:21:28] <Derppy> *but
[02:22:04] <quicksilver> Derppy: *nod*
[02:22:25] <quicksilver> Derppy: make sure you don't accidentally get duplicate IDs using clone(); that can upset some browsers
[02:23:34] <Derppy> quicksilver: Yeah, shouldn't be the case. I'm changing the id's of the clones before I append them.
[02:23:35] <maela> Could anyone please have a look at this http://pastebin.com/bbJLAWZp and give any tip about why $ is not defined in the calculatePrice function?
[02:24:21] <quicksilver> maela: because it is not.
[02:24:35] <quicksilver> maela: $ is only defined inside your (function($) { .... })(); block
[02:24:43] <quicksilver> (that is the purpose of that block, indeed)
[02:24:49] <maela> ummm I see.
[02:25:14] <maela> Ok, so this function should be added to the function($) scope too.
[02:25:16] <maela> Thanks.
[02:27:05] <Derppy> quicksilver: The idea is that there's one master form, which gets duplicated for each item in sort of shopping cart. Each id, for and name attribute gets an appendix of the product's of the product's id and then I try to apply events to everything with $("input[name$=foo]")...
[02:27:18] <Deele> michael_imac, ruby... can't help with that... But, code feels ok, you should make some jsfiddle.net that connects to your server and does the same job
[02:27:44] <michael_imac> still not sure why .error() is just a big deal
[02:27:50] <michael_imac> anyways I'm leaving it for later
[02:28:01] <michael_imac> as got bigger issues, the video player isn't firing up in production...gah
[02:33:12] <computer2000> how can i select the third parent element of 'mything'?
[02:33:22] <computer2000> parent().parent().parent() ?
[02:34:28] <quicksilver> computer2000: sure.
[02:34:46] <computer2000> quicksilver: any 'nicer' way?
[02:34:49] <quicksilver> I wonder why anyone would ask that question instead of just trying it in firebug and seeing if it works.
[02:34:55] <quicksilver> that seems quite nice to me.
[02:35:26] <computer2000> quicksilver: i know it works but was unsure if there was some kind of .parent(3) or someting
[02:35:32] <computer2000> anyway thx
[02:35:42] <quicksilver> you could do closest('table') if you want the closest (grand)parent which is a table
[02:35:55] <computer2000> quicksilver: ok
[02:35:56] <quicksilver> which is a little more robust to slight changes to your document later (like adding another level of divs)
[02:36:05] <InDigital> Deele why hidden iframe should not be used for file uploads?
[02:41:21] <zeppo> question. im loading some DOM through .load() but after its loaded im having a hard time getting jquery to react to the ids and classes in the DOM
[02:41:42] <zeppo> tried using getScript but that makes the animations go nuts
[02:41:51] <Deele> InDigital, you cant control inframe contents
[02:54:01] <gabriel9> hai hai hai, i read here http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ that i can change headers. Well i need to send ajax call without session cookie. :)
[02:55:10] <gabriel9> one ajax call is used with session and i takes 30sec to finish, but i need to send two more in that time. But with sessions that two wait for first to finish.
[02:55:38] <gabriel9> so i need to set up http headers for that to that they don't use sessions(cookie session)
[02:55:47] <gabriel9> i hope i am clear :)
[02:57:19] <shrimp> why does this only work on the first element with the id "hidden", i have also tried with .hidden, but then it outputs the same text in all elements.. http://pastebin.com/rjcKaxPD
[02:58:05] <NodeX> id's are unique
[02:58:47] <shrimp> ok, so why wont it work with a class?
[02:59:20] <NodeX> ?
[02:59:38] <NodeX> perhaps an each() ...
[02:59:57] <NodeX> ?demo @ shrimp
[02:59:58] <bot-t> shrimp, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:00:47] <shrimp> okay, ill do it later, lunch now.. ty so far :)
[03:03:07] <rgr> outside of doing something like location.href =newurl, how do I replace the entire pge with a call to jquery.load() ?
[03:03:15] <rgr> page
[03:04:33] <rgr> because you specified an id.
[03:08:40] <michael_imac> NodeX: $(".inline").colorbox({inline:true, width:"61%"});
[03:08:47] <michael_imac> how can I make that async compatible
[03:15:37] <muszek> hi... I'm writing a piece of code that checks if a value of an input is a number and corrects it if it's not.  I need to have it done as user changes the value in the input.  "keyup" event does the job when user uses a keyboard, but I don't know how to catch an even when user pastes some text with a mouse (right click + "paste").  "change" event works only after the input loses focus... how can I catch it?
[03:18:18] <sneakyness> muszek: oninput?
[03:18:33] <sneakyness> oh wait that might be html5
[03:21:26] <muszek> sneakyness: k.bobek.muszek.com/species/inventory/6 - when you change anything in the 3rd column (Obw. pnia), this field is corrected (if needed) and some values in other fields recalculate.  The only exception is when user pastes text with a mouse and doesn't switch focus to something else.
[03:21:44] <muszek> sorry, http://k.bobek.muszek.com:37080/species/inventory/6
[03:23:34] <NodeX> [11:08:39] <michael_imac> NodeX: $(".inline").colorbox({inline:true, width:"61%"}); .. dunno, i dont use that plugin
[03:23:49] <michael_imac> figured it out
[03:24:00] <michael_imac> ajax is async... so duh!
[03:24:20] <NodeX> lolol
[03:24:29] <michael_imac> I tried doing .live or .bind.colorbox but it spat errors. instead I injected that script after JSON processing is complete
[03:25:17] <michael_imac> in development I was setting up my json response by hand (due to single origin policy, can't test JSON response via AJAX) so never came across the async. issue
[03:25:29] <michael_imac> forgetting async can be a pain hah
[03:25:38] <NodeX> jsonP ftw
[03:25:44] <jomofcw> +1
[03:25:46] <michael_imac> true
[03:25:59] <michael_imac> but I'm proxying the json request through apache
[03:26:05] <NodeX> I nerv run into cross domain issues .. I proxy everything like that
[03:26:08] <michael_imac> so SOP isn't really an issue
[03:26:13] <NodeX> ^ ^
[03:26:16] <michael_imac> heh
[03:26:25] <michael_imac> ok so odd issue no. 2
[03:26:38] <michael_imac> why can't I do $.getJSON().error();
[03:26:54] <NodeX> ?error
[03:27:05] <NodeX> I assume that error is a plugin
[03:27:13] <michael_imac> error is a callback
[03:27:24] <NodeX> you need to var it up iirc
[03:27:40] <michael_imac> as in var up getJSON?
[03:27:41] <NodeX> var j=$.getJSON(...); j.error()...
[03:27:48] <michael_imac> ah.
[03:27:57] <NodeX> I never use it like that but I am sure I've seen it done like that
[03:28:41] <mekwall> ehm
[03:28:49] <michael_imac> http://xhtml.co.il/en/jQuery/jQuery.getJSON
[03:28:50] <NodeX> why aint you using error inside
[03:28:55] <michael_imac> looks like it's chained?
[03:29:20] <NodeX> error is a mthod of ajax though
[03:29:26] <NodeX> it doens't inherit
[03:29:38] <michael_imac> I've not seen it declared like .ajax
[03:29:44] <NodeX> so to access it you need to be inside it or reference it to an object
[03:29:52] <mekwall> michael_imac: you can chain .error
[03:30:03] <michael_imac> getting an error here when I do mekwall
[03:30:21] <mekwall> weird
[03:30:28] <NodeX> var jqxhr = $.getJSON("example.json", function() { <--- like I said above
[03:30:42] <michael_imac> NodeX:
[03:30:48] <NodeX> then it chanins :)
[03:30:51] <NodeX> chains *
[03:31:20] <michael_imac> so only chain the object
[03:31:24] <michael_imac> what about inside?
[03:31:38] <michael_imac> jQuery.getJSON( url [, data] [, success(data, textStatus, jqXHR)] )
[03:31:42] <mekwall> michael_imac: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/646fr/
[03:31:44] <mekwall> proof it works
[03:31:46] <michael_imac> doesn't look like I can do error:
[03:32:09] <mekwall> no, because getJSON is a shorthand method for ajax
[03:34:12] <michael_imac> chaining works nicely for you
[03:34:13] <michael_imac> grr
[03:34:26] <mekwall> because I'm 1336
[03:34:33] <NodeX> lol
[03:34:33] <mekwall> not yet 1337 :(
[03:35:05] <mekwall> michael_imac: I bet it's because you're on an imac
[03:35:13] <mekwall> it's still grieving jobs death
[03:35:27] <michael_imac> }).error(function(){ $('#gallery').html("<h3>The server understands your request but is refusing to fulfill it.</h3>") });
[03:35:36] <michael_imac> that should chain just fine right?
[03:36:04] <mekwall> missing semicolon
[03:36:14] <michael_imac> ah the one inside yes
[03:36:16] <mekwall> depends on what you have before
[03:36:18] <michael_imac> had that last time
[03:36:30] <mekwall> also, you should really cache that selector :P
[03:37:14] <michael_imac> var foo = $() ?
[03:37:33] <mekwall> that will give you an empty jQuery object
[03:37:35] <mekwall> why?
[03:37:53] <michael_imac> ok so for }).error(function(){ $('#gallery').html("<h3>The server understands your request but is refusing to fulfill it.</h3>"); });
[03:38:10] <michael_imac> I'm getting ypeError: Object #<XMLHttpRequest> has no method 'error' (anonymous function)
[03:38:20] <mekwall> michael_imac: can you paste all of ze code somewhere so we can put our monkeys to work?
[03:38:34] <michael_imac> ignore the rest
[03:39:04] <michael_imac> it's just $.getJSON(function(){ ...... ^^ and the bit above
[03:39:14] <mekwall> michael_imac: and what version of jQuery are you using?
[03:39:23] <michael_imac> of course getJSON has the data attribute
[03:39:28] <michael_imac> 1.4 from this app
[03:39:31] <mekwall> michael_imac: ...
[03:39:37] <mekwall> michael_imac: that's your problem
[03:39:40] <michael_imac> uh 1.4.2
[03:39:44] <mekwall> michael_imac: it wasn't introduced until 1.5
[03:39:49] <michael_imac> ah no wonder.
[03:39:55] <mekwall> michael_imac: it's all in the docs
[03:39:57] <michael_imac> damn I thought it was 1.6.2 on this
[03:40:08] <michael_imac> yeah but docs show up for 1.6+
[03:40:15] <mekwall> michael_imac: MINUS 9000!
[03:40:16] <michael_imac> and I forgot to check version.
[03:40:23] <michael_imac> heh
[03:40:32] <michael_imac> so only option is go .ajax?
[03:40:34] <JKarsrud> upgrade the version? :D
[03:40:43] <michael_imac> haha....
[03:40:45] <mekwall> JKarsrud is bright today
[03:40:53] <JKarsrud> That's the easiest thing in the world, nothing ever breaks anyway...
[03:40:54] <michael_imac> no where as crazy
[03:41:01] <michael_imac> oh?
[03:41:11] <mekwall> it should be backwards compatible
[03:41:13] <mekwall> just try it
[03:41:14] <JKarsrud> :P
[03:41:24] <michael_imac> this app has tons of JS all over the place, knockoutJS stacked in some parts..
[03:41:34] <mekwall> 1.6 broke a whole lot of stuff... but should have been fixed
[03:41:52] <michael_imac> right so no fancy error handling for me
[03:41:53] <michael_imac> damn
[03:41:55] <JKarsrud> It should be backwards compatible, so you'll just have to try it. Don't you have automated UI tests? :)
[03:42:04] <michael_imac> I'll switch to .ajax
[03:42:17] <JKarsrud> that's a safe thing to do
[03:42:27] <mekwall> I nearly always use .ajax anyways
[03:43:19] <michael_imac> LOL
[03:43:25] <michael_imac> .ajax introduced in 1.5
[03:43:30] <JKarsrud> no
[03:43:33] <JKarsrud> it's not
[03:43:36] <juha_> woooot
[03:43:41] <mekwall> VODKA!
[03:43:46] <michael_imac> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ << says here?
[03:43:46] <juha_> VODKA TIEM!
[03:43:46] <JKarsrud> wootka?
[03:43:49] <mekwall> michael_imac is all high on it
[03:44:01] <michael_imac> then why does it say 'version added 1.5' :
[03:44:03] <juha_> michael_imac: .ajax was rewritten in 1.5
[03:44:04] <michael_imac> :p
[03:44:17] <michael_imac> I'm well aware it's been there before though
[03:44:23] <michael_imac> else getJSON won't work in 1.4.2 :p
[03:44:26] <mekwall> michael_imac: doh? .... jQuery.ajax( settings ) since version 1.0
[03:44:33] <mekwall> are you FUCKING BLIND?
[03:44:34] <juha_> DUDES
[03:44:39] <JKarsrud> ajax wasn't added, it was rewritten to support deferreds
[03:44:42] <juha_> CALM DOWN AND HUG
[03:44:43] <JKarsrud> juha_ ?
[03:44:49] <michael_imac> so it shouldn't say added
[03:44:51] <JKarsrud> NO!
[03:44:52] <michael_imac> that's my point :p
[03:44:57] <mekwall> michael_imac: yes it should
[03:45:00] <juha_> sir, you need to calm down
[03:45:05] <mekwall> michael_imac: jQuery.ajax( url [, settings] ) <--- was added in 1.5
[03:45:09] <mekwall> notice the url?
[03:45:15] <michael_imac> yup
[03:45:22] <mekwall> good.
[03:45:27] <mekwall> so the syntax is different
[03:45:29] <michael_imac> url wasn't here before that way kk
[03:45:31] <michael_imac> gotcha. thakns
[03:45:47] <mekwall> we need documentation on how to read documentation
[03:45:51] <mekwall> me thinks
[03:45:58] <michael_imac> or I need my morning coffee
[03:46:00] <michael_imac> :)
[03:46:02] <mekwall> just to make it idiot proof
[03:46:31] <mekwall> actually, I might even add a ticket for that
[03:46:54] <JKarsrud> mekwall: do it
[03:46:58] <sneakyness> actually i'm fucking blind
[03:47:02] <sneakyness> nice to meet you
[03:47:27] <mekwall> I'
[03:47:34] <mekwall> I'm deaf
[03:47:43] <mekwall> we would make a good tag team
[03:48:18] <sneakyness> yeah I mean if they had games of tag that involved teams of disabled people as one functional person then maybe, sure
[03:51:27] <impi> how can i remove leading zeros and non numerical caracters from my string? i got this: /[^\d]/g <-- for the non numeric and  /^0+/ for the zero but how would i combine them?
[03:52:22] <mekwall> impi: how about parseInt? :)
[03:53:05] <jmvelasco> hello, this piece of code is not doing the alert having severals elements with class="graphics", what am i doing wrong please ?
[03:53:08] <jmvelasco>         $(".graphics").mouseover(function(e){
[03:53:08] <jmvelasco>           alert(e.pageX);
[03:53:08] <jmvelasco>         });
[03:53:12] <mekwall> NOOOO
[03:53:16] <mekwall> you're doing it wrong
[03:53:38] <jmvelasco> mekwall, so...
[03:53:50] <mekwall> jmvelasco: don't post code in channel.
[03:54:05] <mekwall> paste*
[03:54:12] <jmvelasco> there are only three lines ...
[03:54:22] <mekwall> jmvelasco: so?
[03:54:36] <jmvelasco> what am i doing wrong, beside the code paste
[03:54:39] <jmvelasco> i am sorry
[03:54:53] <mekwall> jmvelasco: if all of the 867 people in here pasted 3 lines each that would be 2601 lines
[03:54:58] <jmvelasco> but for three short lines ... i didn't expect to be need use pastebin
[03:55:11] <jmvelasco> ok ok
[03:55:13] <mekwall> you could have truncated it into one line :)
[03:55:14] <jmvelasco> understand
[03:55:37] <jmvelasco> why is not mouse position caputured ?
[03:55:42] <hugifrb> Hello. When I insert new elements to my side (like add div, copy div) I can not get this elements with the $('#id) selector. Is there any trick how I can get the new elements?
[03:55:55] <jmvelasco> why is not element with class graphics selected ?
[03:56:01] <mekwall> jmvelasco: impossible to tell without seeing the rest of the code
[03:57:46] <mekwall> hugifrb: what? then you are doing something wrong, because you should be able to select any elements, even those dynamically added
[03:58:07] <Spadeski> say i have a picture and want to split it up into 6 peices with borders and display as that how owuld i do that ?
[03:58:15] <alexoulu> hi guys, i'm trying to modify Jcarousel and add a li element that will show each time i rollover each existent li element. Now I am able to rollover and see an additional li element but when i move the mouse to the new element it disappears. How can i keep the mouseover also on the new element ?
[03:58:17] <mekwall> ?hi
[03:58:17] <bot-t> Hey mekwall
[03:58:22] <alexoulu> http://codepad.org/Icdh9rQo
[03:58:23] <mekwall> Hiya!
[03:58:26] <alexoulu> $('div#slideshow-carousel li').live("mouseover", function(){ 		$(this).after("<li class='additional'>qweqwqweqwe</li>"); 	}); 	 	$('div#slideshow-carousel li').live("mouseout", function(){ 		$(".additional").remove(); 	});
[03:59:24] <mekwall> Spadeski: probably set it as background-image with css and define different top/left for each block
[03:59:25] <hugifrb> merkwall: I use clone().insertbefore(....) to copy elements. when I now try to get the #id:last element I get the first one
[03:59:50] <jmvelasco> mekwall, so here is more detailed, but it is not easy to get the code http://pastebin.com/d21081Pw
[04:00:08] <mekwall> hugifrb: #id:last ? ids are unique!
[04:00:11] <mekwall> seriously...
[04:00:23] <hugifrb> oh ok! I try it with class!
[04:00:32] <mekwall> good on ye
[04:01:45] <hugifrb> merkwall: thanks!! you are right!! stupid mistake ;->
[04:02:02] <mekwall> hugifrb: I won't disagree to that :)
[04:02:44] <mekwall> jmvelasco: what if you console.log the event object?
[04:02:53] <shrimp> hi, why wont this work? http://jsfiddle.net/wTMT4/5/
[04:03:17] <jmvelasco> mekwall, sorry, how could i chek this console.log ?
[04:03:20] <mekwall> jmvelasco: alas, using alert to debug is a bad practice
[04:03:50] <jmvelasco> what is a better way ?
[04:03:56] <mekwall> jmvelasco: depends on your browser... for firefox, use firebug... for chrome there's one built-in that you can access with ctrl+shift+i
[04:04:09] <alexoulu> $('div#slideshow-carousel li').live("mouseover", function(){ 		$(this).after("<li class='additional'>qweqwqweqwe</li>"); 	}); 	 	$('div#slideshow-carousel li').live("mouseout", function(){ 		$(".additional").remove(); 	});
[04:04:09] <alexoulu> i m quite new to Jquery, could u give me a hand with this code?
[04:04:20] <alexoulu> i d like to keep the mouseover also on the new element
[04:07:32] <fat_Mike> alexoulu, I'm a jquery novice, only advice i got for you is,  post your code at jsfiddle.net
[04:07:54] <alexoulu> i did post it before
[04:08:00] <alexoulu> http://codepad.org/Icdh9rQo
[04:08:34] <mekwall> shrimp: So many errors in that code... http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/wTMT4/6/
[04:08:50] <mekwall> shrimp: first you were selecting .hidden when you had set them as id
[04:08:54] <mekwall> shrimp: instead of class
[04:09:06] <mekwall> shrimp: secondary, you need to loop each element
[04:09:16] <fat_Mike> missed it alexoulu, well hopefully someone comes to your aid, be patient..... i got my own problems guess I'll come back later
[04:09:33] <alexoulu> hopefully someone can help me out
[04:09:41] <alexoulu> thanks anyway fat_Mike :)
[04:10:41] <shrimp> mekwall, thanks alot. i knew there was errors, but was kinda stuck trying every option i could think of, but the each function seems quite useful..
[04:11:13] <mekwall> shrimp: stuck trying every option? how about learning the basics of html/css/javascript before you do anything more?
[04:12:07] <mekwall> alexoulu: you can use .delegate or .live
[04:12:23] <mekwall> ?.delegate @ alexoulu
[04:12:24] <bot-t> alexoulu, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[04:12:30] <mekwall> ?.live @ alexoulu
[04:12:30] <bot-t> alexoulu, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[04:12:36] <alexoulu> how do i concatenate live to after?
[04:12:43] <alexoulu> not really sure
[04:15:04] <tolland> I want to port a chrome app to use jquery themeing, at the moments it justs got a few bits using the jquery theme. whats the best plan, add the jquery css tags to my existing forms and templates, or rewrite in jquery direct?
[04:15:43] <mekwall> jmvelasco: ask google.
[04:16:16] <mekwall> tolland: add the jquery ui css classes
[04:16:30] <tolland> are there any templating systems, or structured CMS systems (other than drupal that use jquery), if so what is one to look at first?
[04:17:18] <mekwall> tolland: that is more a PHP-related question. you should ask in ##php
[04:18:26] <alexoulu> what i meant is, is it possible  to do it inside these functions? For example 	$('div#slideshow-carousel li').live("mouseover", function(){ 		$(this).after("<li class='additional'>qweqwqweqwe</li>"); 	}); 	in here i create a new li element after i roll over each existent li
[04:18:51] <alexoulu> but how can i add live also in the next li element i create
[04:19:07] <alexoulu> so that the mouseover is valid for both the elements
[04:19:28] <mekwall> alexoulu: .live will work on any elements, even those added dynamically
[04:19:35] <mekwall> that's the whole purpose with live
[04:20:19] <alexoulu> ah, can u please tell me how to do it in practice? I'm stuck with it and I've just started with js and JQuery
[04:20:19] <mekwall> alexoulu: did you try that code out?
[04:20:30] <alexoulu> it works
[04:20:40] <alexoulu> but i d like to add the mouseover also on the new element
[04:20:50] <mekwall> it should already work
[04:21:34] <alexoulu> so that if i rollover on a li element in the carousel it shows a new element but that element stays on focus if i mouseover it too
[04:21:53] <alexoulu> cause now the rollover area is very limited
[04:22:11] <tolland> mekwall: not  a php programmer, only java and javascript
[04:24:22] <alexoulu> i ve tried few times, but nothing working yet on the new element
[04:24:49] <alexoulu> mekwall: could u help me?
[04:25:14] <mekwall> no more time, gotta run
[04:26:05] <seutje> alexoulu: http://jsfiddle.net/seutje/96f6E/ like that?
[04:27:03] <alexoulu> seutje: thanks, but it does already create a new element on rollover
[04:27:33] <seutje> alexoulu: guess I misunderstood you
[04:27:37] <alexoulu> seutje: what i d like to do is, when i rollover and it creates a new li element that it keeps the focus also on the new element
[04:28:07] <alexoulu> seutje: so that the rollover area is enough to read information that i ll put in the new li element
[04:28:17] <seutje> alexoulu: but there is no focus involved here
[04:28:24] <alexoulu> i mean
[04:28:42] <alexoulu> not focus, but that mouseover will involve also the new element
[04:29:06] <alexoulu>  	$('div#slideshow-carousel li').live("mouseover", function(){ 		$(this).after("<li class='additional'>qweqwqweqwe</li>"); 	}); 	 	$('div#slideshow-carousel li').live("mouseout", function(){ 		$(".additional").remove(); 	});
[04:29:12] <alexoulu> this is the actual code
[04:29:28] <alexoulu> what i need is, once created a new li element just by rolling over an existent one
[04:29:28] <tolland> i cant find a good forms and themeing tutorial, am i missing some list of tutorials?
[04:29:31] <seutje> oh
[04:29:44] <alexoulu> the new element won t disappear when i try to rollover on it
[04:30:09] <alexoulu> but it will disappear only if i move the mouse elsewhere from the old element or the new element
[04:30:48] <tolland> I feel like I am missing a whole bunch of documentation. is there a forms tutorial for generating them dynamically from the APIs?
[04:31:25] <seutje> alexoulu: then you should probably nest the inserted element within the trigger
[04:31:34] <seutje> otherwise u get this: http://jsfiddle.net/seutje/96f6E/1/
[04:32:01] <alexoulu> i see
[04:32:12] <alexoulu> it will be passed to the next li element
[04:32:47] <alexoulu> but since i'm new to Jquery, could u show me an example of how to do it?
[04:34:54] <seutje> alexoulu: but this is the first day I'm using jQuery
[04:35:04] <seutje> this seems to work though: http://jsfiddle.net/seutje/96f6E/2/
[04:35:09] <alexoulu> ehhehe
[04:35:15] <seutje> although I would try not to fiddle with the DOM that much
[04:35:17] <alexoulu> :) well u must be a really good programmer then :)
[04:35:31] <seutje> should prolly have the content there onload and just hide/show it with javamascripts
[04:35:59] <seutje> changing the structure of ur DOM every .2 secs is usually not a good idea
[04:36:24] <alexoulu> mmm
[04:36:34] <alexoulu> not sure how to do it in JQuery
[04:36:37] <alexoulu> :/
[04:36:44] <alexoulu> lemme adapt your example
[04:36:47] <alexoulu> to my code
[04:36:51] <alexoulu> hold on
[04:40:01] <seutje> alexoulu: like this, sorta kinda http://jsfiddle.net/seutje/96f6E/3/
[04:42:03] <seutje> alexoulu: http://jsfiddle.net/seutje/96f6E/4/ better
[04:45:10] <alexoulu> mmm
[04:45:15] <alexoulu> still does not work
[04:45:22] <alexoulu> adapting it to my code
[04:47:54] <alexoulu> seutje: u were very kind anyway
[04:47:57] <alexoulu> i appreciate
[04:48:09] <alexoulu> unfortunately nothing works :(
[04:48:22] <seutje> I like the implied past tense there :(
[04:49:25] <snottlebocket> Hey guys, I'm trying to grab a bit of json using jquery but I'm getting an 'invalid label' error in firebug
[04:49:27] <snottlebocket> http://pastebin.com/dPcYNB5h
[04:49:37] <alexoulu> ahaha
[04:49:40] <alexoulu> like i ve lost hope
[04:49:43] <alexoulu> :)
[04:49:52] <snottlebocket> can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong? someone suggests a fix in the documentation but he is immediately replied to by someone saying the fix is a security risk
[04:50:01] <alexoulu> i m kind of tired...being trying to modify this jcarousel for few days now
[04:52:41] <seutje> oh lord, not jCarousel
[04:53:09] <alexoulu> indeed
[04:53:23] <quicksilver> snottlebocket: it probably means your server-side code is not speaking JSONP.
[04:53:34] <quicksilver> if so you need to fix it server-side
[04:53:34] <alexoulu> i already placed the rope next to the coat hanger
[04:53:36] <alexoulu> :D
[04:53:56] <snottlebocket> I'm not so sure, googling invalid label along with query seems to bring up a lot of results
[04:54:03] <snottlebocket> and from what I can tell the json is fine
[04:54:09] <amit_usual> snottlebocket : i do not get the point of jsoncallback=? parameter
[04:54:11] <quicksilver> snottlebocket: I didn't say JSON.
[04:54:14] <quicksilver> snottlebocket: I said JSONP.
[04:55:41] <snottlebocket> hmz, I'll have to read into a little more then, I'm not doing the sever side, I just picked a bit of query from the docs hoping it would work
[05:13:59] <nights> hello
[05:14:03] <nights> why is this not doing what i want
[05:14:04] <nights> http://pastebin.com/f1RdakXr
[05:14:06] <nights> :(
[05:14:16] <nights> not sure about the syntax, do i need semicolon?
[05:15:40] <seutje> nights: removeAttr only takes 1 argument
[05:17:02] <nights> seutje: thank you very much, that is indeed true.
[05:19:05] <zamabe> FYI, a guy named nights might join here soon. He's going to wonder why this doesn't work. http://pastebin.com/f1RdakXr
[05:19:14] <zamabe> Please fuck with him a little bit about indention.
[05:19:57] <nights> [21:17] <radio23> brb, need to change the dressing on my hand again.
[05:19:58] <nights> [21:17] <zamabe> Good. You're buying, because I'm underage :(
[05:20:00] <snottlebocket> what's wrong with his indentation?
[05:20:30] <nights> he's just delusional
[05:20:34] <nights> (and underage)
[05:20:47] <zamabe> aww.
[05:20:55] <snottlebocket> scram kid :p
[05:21:05] <zamabe> snottlebocket, he didn't close his function calls and claims they're not supposed to be closed.
[05:21:17] <zamabe> so we've just been messing with him since he's been asking in the wrong channel.
[05:21:21] <snottlebocket> that's unrelated to indentation though
[05:21:24] <zamabe> I know.
[05:21:29] <zamabe> "Please fuck with him a little"
[05:21:50] <nights> geez
[05:21:52] <seutje> wtf r u on about?
[05:21:54] <snottlebocket> nights… your mother was a trough and your father smelled of elderberries
[05:22:02] <nights> hehe
[05:22:07] <seutje> trough?
[05:22:22] <zamabe> snottlebocket++
[05:22:32] <seutje> ?g monty python your mother was a hamster
[05:22:34] <bot-t> seutje, French Taunting - Monty Python and the Holy Grail - YouTube - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V7zbWNznbs
[05:23:49] <snottlebocket> really it was hamster? it's been too long since I saw the holy grail
[05:24:28] <seutje> definitely isn't a "trough"
[05:24:34] <seutje> ?Define trough
[05:24:36] <bot-t> seutje, trough - (noun) A long, narrow container, open on top, for feeding or watering animals.
[05:24:57] <snottlebocket> that's a handy bot
[05:25:29] <seutje> ?mlu
[05:25:30] <bot-t> much like urself
[05:26:30] <nights> still doenst work....
[05:26:36] <nights> sigh.,
[05:26:55] <nights> why its behavior is still so amgiuous.
[05:27:42] <seutje> nights: try a fiddle, lot easier to debug
[05:28:14] <nights> ok
[05:28:24] <nights> http://jsfiddle.net/ ?
[05:28:53] <aro> has anyone seen something where jquery sorts a json response by key instead of the order it is received in?
[05:29:29] <seutje> aro: whaaa?
[05:29:49] <aro> well when i check this out in chrome, it receives the data fine
[05:29:51] <nights> seutje: i ran it, i think it crashed the remote server :p
[05:29:58] <aro> but whenit puts it in the select box, it orders it by key name
[05:30:21] <nights> seutje: does this work with jquery tho?
[05:30:45] <seutje> aro: can't rly rely on the order of an object afaik
[05:32:10] <aro> what do i do
[05:32:14] <aro> is there a way to sort it?
[05:33:07] <nights> seutje: Your JS code is valid.
[05:33:12] <nights> still doesnt work :(
[05:33:56] <nights> it works for a moment here and there
[05:34:03] <nights> then after a reload now it breaks again.
[05:35:14] <nights> could it be because i get the script and html through an ajax call?
[05:41:35] <rgr> yes. you might have to strip slashes. depends on the datatype of the ajax call.
[05:42:49] <rgr> aro: thanks to closures you KNOW the order you are receivnig things in. mark a var before the json call.
[05:45:10] <fat_Mike> how may I modify my code to only highlight rows and not individual columns. http://jsfiddle.net/5cWnf/
[05:47:39] <zamabe> fat_Mike, http://jsfiddle.net/5cWnf/1/
[05:49:06] <fat_Mike> thanks zamabe but it's not working
[05:49:34] <rgr> that doesnt work
[05:50:22] <fat_Mike> "tr:nth-child(n+1)"" strange stuff at least for me
[05:50:37] <xec> how about http://jsfiddle.net/5cWnf/2/
[05:50:45] <zamabe> it's a CSS thing. The sizzle selector engine supports those, though :)
[05:51:33] <zamabe> fat_Mike, http://jsfiddle.net/5cWnf/3/
[05:51:53] <zamabe> and I thought you only wanted the JS to apply to every other row. My bad.
[05:52:21] <xec> then you would need "2n" no?
[05:52:39] <rgr> td:nth-child(3) I would htink. But I dont know nth-child;)
[05:52:42] <zamabe> d'oh. You're right.
[05:52:51] <fat_Mike> xec & zanabe thanks guys
[05:52:54] <zamabe> rgr, no. That specifies only the 3rd child
[05:53:00] <rgr> ok
[05:56:43] <ShawnRisk> how do I create a way to load images with a play button on top that when you click the button it swaps in a video to start playing and out the image.  Any ideas?
[05:57:21] <bjensen> what does closest return if it doesn't find any elements? I can't find the answer in the docs..
[05:57:33] <bjensen> The closest method ofcause
[05:58:18] <kswedberg> bjensen: it returns a jQuery object with length 0. Same as any other DOM traversal method.
[05:58:23] <bjensen> it returns 1 or 0 object
[05:58:24] <bjensen> ah
[05:58:47] <fat_Mike> xec or zamabe would you guys pls explain this $(this).parent() ?
[05:59:12] <xec> http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[05:59:28] <zamabe> fat_Mike, read the manual.
[05:59:35] <zamabe> oy, how convenient :)
[05:59:58] <fat_Mike> k Thanks.
[06:00:13] <timing> <parent><child /></parent>
[06:01:18] <fat_Mike> thx timing
[06:01:47] <ShawnRisk> any ideas on my question?  I have looked around the web with no answers.
[06:04:52] <FND> hi - in $.ajax's beforeSend, can I somehow inject something into settings.data? if I do that, it seems to be ignored
[06:06:14] <soee> what is the easiest way to show some info/tooltip div when ajax request is done and than after ~ 4 seconds destroy such div?
[06:07:06] <muszek> how can I select a just inserted element?
[06:07:40] <rroelofs> just like any other.  does it have a class / id you can target?
[06:08:02] <muszek> not really (I guess I'd have to give it one)
[06:08:03] <FND> soee: in the success callback, you can do something like $(".notification").text(message).delay(4000).slideUp();
[06:08:21] <FND> muszek: if you append it, you could do :last
[06:08:27] * FND waves at mahemoff 
[06:08:27] <rroelofs> muszek: if you have a reference to it in a js var you can just use that
[06:08:54] <muszek> FND: I insert it either after() some element or via append(), depending on circuimstances
[06:09:21] <FND> muszek: a minimal test case would help
[06:09:39] <muszek> FND: one second
[06:10:12] <soee> FND: can i somehow create such element without using selector ?
[06:10:40] <dalgard> can anyone tell me when 1.7 is due? looking forward to the innershiv feature...
[06:10:41] <FND> soee: sure you could, it's just DOM manipulation
[06:11:15] <soee> FND: some tip? on cuccess create some div - show it, wait 4 sec, destroy
[06:12:21] <FND> soee: $('<div class="error" />').text(error).hide().appendTo(context).slideDown().delay(2000).slideUp(function() { $(this).remove(); }); // or something like that
[06:16:55] <dalgard> is .css() asynchronous in any way? when doing stuff like this: elem.css("width", elem.width()).addClass("bigWidth") - the width is set delayed and reflect the changes set by the new class!!
[06:16:58] <bartek> Hi there. I am using slideToggle to hide/show a div, but what if I want to explicitly hide it in some cases? Is there a slide[Hide] or something? Or do I have to just set display to none on the div manually?
[06:17:32] <dalgard> bartek: slideUp
[06:17:52] <bartek> dalgard: Oh, geez. Thanks :-)
[06:18:08] <dalgard> :)
[06:18:15] <Rafaelzinhu> hi
[06:20:20] <zeppo> when using .load() to add to the DOM.  how do I get jquery to react to the new objects?
[06:20:51] <zeppo> if that makes sense
[06:22:05] <mekwall> zeppo: you mean if jQuery can know if an element has been added to the dom? then no
[06:22:18] <Celes> good morning rawr
[06:22:27] <muszek> rroelofs, FND: test case: http://jsfiddle.net/muszek/F9ews/7/ .  I want to selected a new item where it says "I want to select a newly created item here" :)
[06:22:53] <dalgard> zeppo: you pass it an event handler (load is asynchronous)
[06:23:02] <mekwall> zeppo: there's the jquery live plugin, but I wouldn't recommend you to use it...
[06:23:22] <FND> muszek: just do `var el = $(content);` before operating on it?
[06:23:24] <zeppo> yeah
[06:23:34] <zeppo> i tried using getScript but that made my animations freak out
[06:23:58] <zeppo> i'll check event handlers
[06:23:58] <mekwall> zeppo: can you show us the code?
[06:24:16] <zeppo> i mean more in general. had this problem a couple of times on different sites
[06:24:42] <zeppo> i mean, if i have $('#foo') bla bla and i load <a id="foo">hello</a> it wont find it
[06:25:12] <muszek> FND: I'll try it (I wasn't aware you can select like that)
[06:25:28] <FND> content is not a selector, it's HTML
[06:25:31] <seutje> zeppo: can't find a cake before it's baked
[06:25:33] <FND> ^^ muszek
[06:25:41] <zeppo> well thats what im saying
[06:25:57] <zeppo> so event handlers i guess is the way to go then
[06:28:11] <muszek> FND: I don't understand... could you please modify that fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/muszek/F9ews/8/
[06:34:04] <rroelofs> muszek: http://jsfiddle.net/F9ews/9/
[06:36:16] <muszek> rroelofs: thanks.  Didn't know you can do it like this?  Any idea where I can read about it?
[06:36:38] <seutje> it's just storing the result of a function, rly
[06:38:01] <rroelofs> seutje: correct.  muszek when you do it that way, jQuery creates a documentFragment which is then inserted into the dom.  your reference stays valid.
[06:39:25] <soee> i have element that is replaced by new one, now how can i get position left/top of the new one >
[06:39:26] <soee> ?
[06:40:05] <rroelofs> muszek: You can read about it here. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery2
[06:40:14] <muszek> thank you
[06:40:23] <luosheng> hi
[06:43:12] <bartek> What's the best way to check if a DOM element has any content?
[06:43:25] <luosheng> I'm using jquery cookie plugin, and my cookie name is 'wmkCookie[recent_place][name2]'.  When I using this plugin as "$.cookie('wmkCookie[recent_place][name2]')", it returns null.  I checked the source code and changed "encodeURIComponent(key)" to just "key" and still got null returned.  I think this may because I used square brackets in my cookies' name,  how can I solve this problem?
[06:44:15] <rroelofs> bartek: var content = $("selector").text()
[06:44:28] <FND> muszek: I'm busy and in a hurry right now, hang on
[06:45:04] <ShawnRisk> how do I create a way to load images with a play button on top that when you click the button it swaps in a video to start playing and out the image.  Any ideas?
[06:45:05] <muszek> FND: I got an answer from r'roelofs (typo intentional).  Thanks for your help.
[06:46:02] <FND> ✓
[06:50:32] <ShawnRisk> bartek: I am unsure but did you check the jquery api?
[06:50:37] <dirkpennings> guys, how to loop through list items (i.e. 21 pieces) and apply styles to it, but having groups of 3 items per loop count?
[06:51:06] <dirkpennings> so, a jQuery selector to select 3 list items and then the next 3 and so on..
[06:51:41] <ShawnRisk> dirkpennings: rephrase
[06:53:10] <Patabugen> Hey, Does anyone know of an up to date and working LazyLoad plugin for jQuery?
[06:53:53] <alexoulu> trying to customize JCarousel I encountered a small issue: I'm trying to show a textarea with a button next to each li element of the carousel but when I move the mouse out of the element the new li element disappears. How can I keep the mouseover also on the just created new li element ?
[06:53:54] <skamikaze> Patabugen: lazyloading what? img? css? scripts?
[06:54:07] <Patabugen> skamikaze Ah sorry, images
[06:54:36] <skamikaze> there's a plugin from jaubourg, hold on a min
[06:54:38] <makinen> How can I submit a html form and perform some action according to the value returned by the server?
[06:54:45] <alexoulu> http://codepad.org/Icdh9rQo
[06:54:53] <ShawnRisk> Patabugen: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/lazykarl
[06:54:56] <skamikaze> Patabugen: https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks
[06:55:03] <alexoulu> from line 52 till 59
[06:55:30] <alexoulu> now it shows me a new li element each time i mouseover on a carousel li element
[06:55:40] <Patabugen> ShawnRisk: thank  you!
[06:55:59] <ShawnRisk> Patabugen: you're welcome
[06:56:02] <alexoulu> if i move the mouse out of the element and i focus on the new one it disappears
[06:56:12] <Patabugen> and thanks skamikaze =)
[06:56:23] <phrearch> hello
[06:56:32] <phrearch> does anyone know how to snap back a jquery ui draggable?
[06:56:45] <dirkpennings> ShawnRisk: difficult to explain, but simple version: I'm looking for a selector that grabs 3 items from an array and then the next 3 and so on..
[06:56:46] <phrearch> i need it to go back to the original position on stop
[06:57:00] <phrearch> ow nm. found it already :)
[06:57:16] <alexoulu> http://jsfiddle.net/96f6E/5/
[06:57:21] <alexoulu> how can i do it?
[06:58:17] <ShawnRisk> dirkpennings: I am not sure how you do that.  I thought arrays can only do 1 at a time.
[06:58:45] <danzik17> dirkpennings: To apply different styles/classes or something?
[07:00:42] <ShawnRisk> danzik17: I think he makes css styles and the rest
[07:02:47] <dirkpennings> danzik17: yeah, to apply equalHeight() to every "row" of 3 list items..
[07:03:05] <rroelofs> alexoulu: I'm confused.  your code seems to be working.http://jsfiddle.net/96f6E/6/
[07:06:27] <alexoulu> rroelofs: it does work indeed but not what I need to do. It's fine like that but I'd like to keep the new element visible also when I mouseover on it. Actually with this code as soon as I move the mouse out of the old li element , the new li element disappears
[07:07:00] <danzik17> dirkpennings: (untested) Try something like var t = $( selector ).get();  while ( t.length ) { $( t.splice(0, 3) ).equalHeight(); }
[07:07:10] <alexoulu> how can I keep the element visible both ways if i mouseover the old element and also the just created one
[07:12:17] <Germanaz0> hello everybody
[07:12:21] <Germanaz0> someone is familiar with tinyce ?
[07:12:26] <Germanaz0> *tinymce
[07:16:08] <alexoulu> rroelofs:  any idea ?
[07:16:28] <itatitat> ey guys!
[07:16:39] <itatitat> why console.log dont work in my firefox?
[07:16:51] <itatitat> im using jquery, but when I use it.....nothing
[07:17:04] <FNTom> itatitat: Do you have Firebug installed?
[07:17:07] <itatitat> yes
[07:17:19] <FNTom> itatitat: Do you have it enabled?
[07:17:24] <rroelofs> alexoulu: you might want to try hover
[07:17:28] <itatitat> yes yes, I'm using it
[07:17:36] <itatitat> only console.log dont work..
[07:17:57] <FNTom> Odd...
[07:18:06] <alexoulu> rroelofs:  since i'm totally new to JQuery and js could you please show me an example?
[07:18:19] <itatitat> oh!
[07:18:21] <itatitat> sorry
[07:18:24] <itatitat> now work
[07:18:29] <itatitat> sorry, thanks for your help
[07:18:35] <itatitat> is an error in my code..
[07:18:37] <itatitat> thanks
[07:18:42] <ShawnRisk> how come my questions never get answered :(
[07:20:01] <FNTom> ShawnRisk: Do you ask complicated questions?
[07:20:04] <govorunkz> clear
[07:20:13] <FNTom> See... I just answered your question (although with another question :S)
[07:20:14] <ShawnRisk> FNTom: not from where I stand
[07:20:51] <rroelofs> alexoulu: working on it.
[07:21:24] <alexoulu> rroelofs : I appreciate very much. Thanks for your help
[07:22:04] <ShawnRisk> FNTom: I can ask one more time but it is annoying to ask so many times
[07:25:19] <computer2000> how can i select elements within $(this) ?
[07:26:28] <Peeter> $(this).find(""); ?
[07:26:33] <Peeter> $(this).find(".className"); ?
[07:26:38] <Peeter> $(this).find("#id");
[07:26:59] <seutje> computer2000: direct descendants? -> .children()
[07:27:02] <FNTom> No, $('#element', this)
[07:27:09] <FNTom> $('.class', this) etc
[07:27:15] <computer2000> FNTom: thx thats it
[07:27:28] <Peeter> FNTom, that's horrible practice
[07:27:37] <seutje> hahaha :')
[07:27:48] <Peeter> It's incredibly hard to read code like that
[07:27:58] <seutje> "you're wrong, here's a different way to write THE EXACT SAME THING:..."
[07:28:08] <Peeter> "I'm looking for this", "Oh yeah, from this context"
[07:28:13] <rroelofs> alexoulu: Sorry that took so long.  work intevenin... http://jsfiddle.net/96f6E/7/
[07:28:23] <shesek> $(this).find()... is faster, $(..., this) internally delegates to it
[07:28:24] <Peeter> Instead of "Im looking from this context this thing"
[07:28:39] <shesek> I made a jsperf test for that
[07:28:40] <khmer> Peeter: sometimes you prioritize performance over developer happiness
[07:28:56] <Peeter> khmer: And developer happiness generally comes from understanding code :P
[07:29:09] <khmer> Peeter: i..yes honey
[07:29:28] <Peeter> It's kinda moving backward, "selector", context
[07:29:34] <Peeter> instead of context, "selector"
[07:29:50] <Peeter> Well, that's my 2 cents in it.
[07:29:55] <gho5t> I'm using the jquery tooltip plugin which creates the tooltip using the title attribute. When I update the title attribute using js the tooltip needs to get reinitiallized so it will now use the new title value. I've tried calling $('.help-bubble').tooltip() again but it still shows the previous title's value in the tooltip. How can I reinitialize/destroy the tooltip/
[07:30:34] <seutje> khmer: erm, but dev happiness and perf are the same thing in this case
[07:30:43] <alexoulu> rroelofs : THANKS !!! it finally works... now i need to adapt it to my code to see if it works
[07:30:51] <khmer> seutje: i swiftly declaimed this fight, upon realizing that
[07:31:10] <khmer> i'm with Peeter actually, i don't like the context argument to the factory function
[07:31:53] <alexoulu> rroelofs: or better i did test it on my code. but there s smt to change. I ll try to apply it with "after" to the li element
[07:31:53] <FNTom> Peeter: Meh, I see it as preference really. $(selector, context) seems nicer to me.
[07:32:16] <FNTom> Doesn't look like there's any real performance difference
[07:32:38] <seutje> FNTom: http://jsperf.com/jquery-find-with-context/4
[07:32:50] <Peeter> Sorry, but that's just horrible practice to me :P I get annoyed each time I think I grasp the code and then the context changes.
[07:33:56] <jklmnop> is there any way to access the queue for UI tabs?
[07:34:32] <khmer> oh yeah, zero difference
[07:34:34] <khmer> one function call
[07:35:24] <seutje> 10% difference on average is considerable imo
[07:35:37] <FNTom> seutje: I stand corrected, though that seems crazy.
[07:35:56] <Guest13407> is there a combination progress bar and slider like on youtube videos where it shows the current position and how much has been downloaded?
[07:36:06] <khmer> i do think that people get a little snooty about their semantic jquery
[07:36:15] <khmer> as though jquery isn't doing a shitload of work to make it look like a pretty sentence
[07:36:23] <khmer> sometimes code doesn't look linear
[07:36:29] <khmer> do you get confused and furious when you exit a loop?
[07:37:43] <claire_design> hi everyeone
[07:37:53] <khmer> Guest13407: well, youtube is doing it! :) but i don't know of a specific plugin...you could adapt ui slider pretty easily though
[07:38:14] <claire_design> is anyone available to help me with some Jquery code?
[07:38:18] <rroelofs> alexoulu: applying the hover to the li will make you event fire when you move your mouse off the li
[07:38:57] <khmer> claire_design: best thing to do is just ask the question
[07:39:43] <alexoulu> rroelofs: I noticed... I really have no idea how to do it. I have tried all day with no success. Basically I got the JCarousel and inside the carousel for each picture I d like to show information of it next to it when I rollover the pic
[07:40:33] <rroelofs> then you want to hover the li and append the data to the li, then use css to put it where you want visually
[07:40:39] <alexoulu> rroelofs: but for a layout issue, i'd like to show the new li next to the existent li, with the code you created it works when applied to the ul but it appears underneath the carousel and not next to the li
[07:42:17] <Guest13407> it looks like i can use progressbar and slider on the same element at the same time
[07:42:21] <Guest13407> that's a neat trick
[07:42:24] <alexoulu> rroelofs:the prob is, since each picture it's only a small thumbnail, when i move the mouse out of it, the new li disappears
[07:42:40] <khmer> Guest13407: pretty cool! you can also subscribe to the step event on the progress bar and move the slider
[07:42:46] <alexoulu> rroelofs:that's why i wanted to keep it visible next to the old li
[07:43:13] <rroelofs> alexoulu: http://jsfiddle.net/96f6E/8/
[07:43:50] <rroelofs> alexoulu: use to put the new element wherever you want
[07:44:13] <rroelofs> alexoulu: sorry, use css to put the new element where you want
[07:44:42] <claire_design> im woundering if anyone can help me write a better version of the following code, at the moment the code has some minor bugs in ie, http://jsfiddle.net/hVWa4/
[07:46:23] <crankharder> does jquery have a nice way of dividing an array (could be a jquery set) into groups of a given number?  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11].foo(5) -> [[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10], [11]]
[07:48:09] <itatitat> ey

[08:35:46] <jeffsmykil> ty
[08:35:51] <jeffsmykil> I know why its doing it
[08:35:52] <jeffsmykil> like I said
[08:36:01] <jeffsmykil> just trying to figure out the best way to fix it
[08:36:19] <aaronmcadam> it's all about context
[08:36:34] <andornaut> Is it faster to use a selector narrowed by element name? IOW is table.find('tr.row') faster than table.find('.row')?
[08:36:47] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[08:36:49] <aaronmcadam> not really
[08:36:53] <aaronmcadam> a class will still be slow
[08:37:00] <aaronmcadam> the selector is parsed right to left andornaut
[08:37:15] <andornaut> aaronmcadam: ah okay
[08:37:23] <aaronmcadam> qualifying it with an element might even slow it down lol
[08:37:38] <aaronmcadam> use jsperf if ur worried that much
[08:37:45] <andornaut> aaronmcadam: how'bout things like :visible?
[08:37:49] <aaronmcadam> ah man
[08:37:51] <andornaut> aaronmcadam: will check that out
[08:37:51] <aaronmcadam> that's the slowest
[08:38:11] <aaronmcadam> any pseudo selector is very slow compared to everythin else

[08:43:05] <kloewer> @bot-t Yes, but how to get it not only for the first but for every element?
[08:43:22] <aaronmcadam> yes it does jeffsmykil be patient ffs
[08:43:30] <aaronmcadam> there's like 5 slides dedicated to ajax
[08:44:08] <jeffsmykil> yes i read those

[08:45:32] <jeffsmykil> ty
[08:45:34] <aaronmcadam> it's easy once u realise what you're doing wrong
[08:45:57] <eddiemonge> kloewer: you will have to loop through them and add them to an array or something
[08:46:06] <jeffsmykil> i get what im doing wrong just have to figure out how to do it right :D
[08:46:16] <aaronmcadam> right
[08:46:31] <aaronmcadam> if u keep all the references you need in an abstracted function
[08:46:41] <aaronmcadam> and pass that to success
[08:47:14] <aaronmcadam> you're trying to run sequential code that depends on asynchronous code
[08:47:19] <jeffsmykil> i am meeting defered now
[08:47:23] <jeffsmykil> this one is helpful also
[08:47:28] <aaronmcadam> ye
[08:47:37] <antihero> eddiemonge: Ah, I'll make it more complete
[08:48:25] <eddiemonge> antihero: also more info on that error message would be helpful, like what line it is showing for
[08:48:38] <aaronmcadam> jeffsmykil: $.ajax is a deferred, it returns a promise
[08:48:46] <jeffsmykil> k
[08:48:52] <jeffsmykil> im going to have to read this like 10 times
[08:48:53] <aaronmcadam> but probably getting ahead of yourself if u don't actually know ajax

[08:50:23] <jojovem> Hy guys, i need a little help with a fancybox call with the google plus button
[08:50:40] <jojovem> The problem is when i call teh fancybox by the second time, i get errors on firebug
[08:51:02] <jojovem> http://pastebin.com/CyNxGSrP
[08:51:20] <jojovem> in this paste you can see the fancybox call, and the script call at the view
[08:51:45] <jojovem> I think the script is being called twice and then grabbing errors
[08:52:02] <jojovem> is there a way to check if a javascript file was already loaded so i dont call it twice/
[08:52:34] <level09> is .html() the best way to replace the content of an element with something else ?
[08:53:02] <antihero> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/393Av/6/ however it works in that :S
[08:53:07] <level09> jojovem: use a variable that flags as true once the script is loaded
[08:53:29] <jojovem> ill try that level09
[08:53:37] <eddiemonge> antihero: are you meaning to make t and sp global?
[08:53:44] <jita> Is it possible to hide the checkboxes and only display onmouseover the division? http://i.imgur.com/V0xsw.png
[08:53:58] <antihero> eddiemonge: I think they're in the scope
[08:53:58] <jojovem> level09 the best way is to load the js through jquery then
[08:54:06] <jita> I mean when the mouse is not hovering over the division
[08:54:10] <jita> hide the checkboxes
[08:54:17] <jita> and when the mouse goes to that division
[08:54:17] <eddiemonge> jojoyes
[08:54:21] <jita> display the checkboxes ?
[08:54:24] <aaronmcadam> Claire_design: I ask you to refer to the rules of the room... no PMs please
[08:54:25] <jita> is it possible ?
[08:54:34] <eddiemonge> ooops meant jita. yes it is possible
[08:54:43] <level09> jojovem: not sure what you are doing, but you can either use jquery or even js
[08:54:47] <jita> eddiemonge: how ?

[09:02:42] <aaronmcadam> jeffsmykil: yeah so what

[09:02:53] <aaronmcadam> gtg anyway cyas
[09:03:01] <jeffsmykil> thanks
[09:04:03] <Snooops> nobody up for my problem?
[09:04:29] <jeffsmykil> im confused when he says function (data, status, jqXHR)
[09:04:38] <jeffsmykil> is function just a place holder for the function name?
[09:04:56] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: it's an anonymous function
[09:05:00] <lacrymology> how can I print an element's full HTML? (as in, including the own element's tag, not just inner)
[09:05:08] <jojovem> Hi guys, im really having trouble trying to load a fancybox twice without having problems with the googleplus Button!
[09:05:21] <jojovem> I think fancybox is calling the same javascript twice
[09:05:26] <jojovem> causing the errors
[09:05:30] <jojovem> can anyone help me?
[09:05:48] <jeffsmykil> jojovem: http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[09:06:07] <adrianp> is that proper grammar?
[09:06:46] <jojovem> jeffsmykil, cool website
[09:06:56] <jojovem> but i think im familiar with debugging tools
[09:07:06] <jojovem> i just need a hint to where to go
[09:07:11] <jeffsmykil> jojovem: well then set breakpoints and find out where its calling it the second time
[09:07:29] <jojovem> its a fancybox i can call it several times
[09:07:37] <jojovem> but, in the second time further
[09:07:41] <jojovem> i get errors
[09:08:03] <jojovem> im almost sure thats because its calling the javascript(inside the view called by the fancybox) several times
[09:08:41] <jojovem> im trying to set a varibale to hold the flag but i dont know how to do it
[09:09:21] <jojovem> because the scope is different
[09:09:42] <eddiemonge> jojovem: you need more context in your example
[09:09:53] <jojovem> Ok ill explain it
[09:10:32] <jojovem> I have a fancybox call, the calls a simple view (im not using the latest jquery or fancybox). Inside this view i have a googleplus button
[09:10:52] <jojovem> And also inside the view i have the javascript call
[09:10:57] <jojovem> $.getScript('https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js');
[09:11:07] <eddiemonge> Snooops: whats your problem besides like of caching and chaining?
[09:11:13] <necromancer> is there a way i can detect when the user tabs away from my page? i built a slideshow plugin but when you tab away from it then tab back in firefox, it goes all light-speed
[09:11:27] <jojovem> So, when i call the fancybox one time only, it works like a charm
[09:11:42] <jojovem> but, when i call the fancybox 2 or more times, it gives me errors(On Firebug)
[09:11:42] <eddiemonge> jojovem: well dont do that. unless you have an iframe, you only need to call that script once
[09:11:53] <jojovem> but, how can i control that?
[09:11:58] <eddiemonge> necromancer: its an issue being worked on
[09:12:01] <eddiemonge> in core
[09:12:02] <jojovem> because the javascript call is inside the view
[09:12:09] <necromancer> eddiemonge: you're an issue being worked on ;)
[09:12:13] <eddiemonge> jojovem: load it outside of fancybox
[09:12:21] <eddiemonge> necromancer: yeah, i am
[09:12:22] <Snooops> eddiemonge, this code i posted dont work twice, the doubleclick dont work anymore on this element with class "editfield"
[09:12:24] <jojovem> when i do that, the button just dont appear
[09:12:43] <jojovem> the ajax called view doesnt "see" the previously called javascript
[09:12:43] <necromancer> eddiemonge: is it a jQuery thing or a Firefox thing? i don't notice it happening in other browsers
[09:12:58] <jojovem> only when its set inline
[09:13:04] <lduros> hello, for some reason I still can't wrap my head around callbacks, closure, ... Is there a good reference online for me to understand it better?
[09:13:08] <lduros> especially callbacks?
[09:13:09] <lduros> :-)
[09:13:17] <lduros> for javascript, not necessarily jquery
[09:14:19] <yedimind> lduros, http://kangax.github.com/nfe/
[09:14:25] <yedimind> not specific to callbacks, but really good reading in general
[09:14:58] <eddiemonge> Snooops: cache $(this) and chain your methods then repaste
[09:15:10] <jojovem> Page 1 calls Page 2 via fancybox. If i set the javascript for google button in Page 1, Page 2 doesnt render the button, if i put the javascript call inside Page 2, it works in the first time and i get errors on 2 times or more
[09:15:14] <eddiemonge> necromancer: its a jquery thing
[09:15:17] <jeffsmykil> I'm having trouble understanding this without comments anyone walk me through it?
[09:15:18] <jeffsmykil> http://danheberden.com/presentations/deferreds-putting-laziness-to-work/#31
[09:15:22] <lduros> yedimind: thanks
[09:15:35] <necromancer> eddiemonge: can it be fixed right now by downgrading?
[09:15:43] <eddiemonge> lduros: read "Javascript Patterns"
[09:15:58] <eddiemonge> jojovem: is page 2 an iframe?
[09:16:00] <Snooops> eddiemonge how do i cache?
[09:16:05] <lduros> eddiemonge: you mean the book?
[09:16:13] <jojovem> No, a normal html view
[09:16:25] <eddiemonge> ?deferreds @ jeffsmykil
[09:16:25] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, Read this for getting started with deferreds: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[09:16:36] <Snooops> eddiemonge, ah i got it
[09:16:38] <eddiemonge> necromancer: no
[09:16:45] <jeffsmykil> ty
[09:16:49] <jojovem> i think the only iframe inside it is the facebook button, but it is working
[09:17:01] <eddiemonge> Snooops var $this = $(this);  $this.action()
[09:17:02] <jojovem> im having trouble only in the googleplus
[09:17:06] <eddiemonge> lduros: yes
[09:17:07] <logik-bomb> is it possible to negate a selector? something like $(div#* && !div#bob) ? :X
[09:17:16] <eddiemonge> jojovem: whats your code again see ? pe
[09:17:16] <bot-t> jojovem, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[09:17:40] <eddiemonge> ? not @ logik-bomb
[09:17:40] <bot-t> logik-bomb, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[09:17:42] <jojovem> Alright!
[09:17:51] <jojovem> http://pastebin.com/CyNxGSrP
[09:17:54] <logik-bomb> eddiemonge: thank you :)
[09:18:19] <jojovem> There is the fancybox call, and the piece of code inside the view called by the fancybox
[09:18:47] <jojovem> that id="teste" was for testing purposes, you can ignore that
[09:18:48] <eddiemonge> .... thats not jsfiddle
[09:19:21] <kryl> hi
[09:19:32] <kryl> how to prevent link actions with jquery or css please ?
[09:20:03] <jojovem> Kryl
[09:20:06] <jojovem> if you have
[09:20:16] <antihero> How do I get the next element
[09:20:19] <jojovem> <a class="link">LINK</a>
[09:20:23] <jojovem> then you do
[09:20:37] <eddiemonge> ?preventdefault @ kryl
[09:20:38] <bot-t> kryl, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[09:20:55] <eddiemonge> jojovem: move the plusone script outside of the view and onto the page
[09:20:55] <jojovem> $('.link').click(function(e){e.preventDefault;});
[09:21:13] <jojovem> i did that, the button never renders
[09:21:28] <jojovem> i even tried to put it in the header of my system
[09:21:35] <kryl> thank you !
[09:22:27] <jojovem> Im sure the problem is the javascript called twice, but im really stressed because i cant fix it!
[09:22:27] <jojovem> hehe
[09:22:36] <jojovem> i tried everything!
[09:23:26] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: there is a place in brighton with fried oreos...
[09:24:19] <erichynds> jeffsmykil: wings express?
[09:24:38] <jeffsmykil> ok, there might be two places in brighton with fried oreos :-p
[09:24:48] <jojovem> the jsapi can be called several times, but googleplus.js not
[09:25:01] <erichynds> haha
[09:25:07] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: is wings epress on washington st?
[09:25:09] <erichynds> that place has deep fried snickers too
[09:25:13] <erichynds> i think so
[09:25:19] <jeffsmykil> yeah that's the one
[09:25:21] <jeffsmykil> lol
[09:25:24] <jeffsmykil> freaking nuts
[09:25:28] <erichynds> so awes
[09:25:37] <jeffsmykil> they call it "carnival food"
[09:25:52] <jeffsmykil> I didn't have any as I need to watch my girlish figure
[09:27:20] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: it's quite disturbing
[09:27:33] <kryl> bye
[09:27:34] <erichynds> hah, i've never had em either
[09:27:36] <erichynds> which is a mistake
[09:31:04] <tomasm-> is there a way to add arbitrary attributes to an arbitrary element, that's fairly supported in browsers, even older IE versions?
[09:31:29] <eddiemonge> jojovem: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/HaFrM/1/
[09:31:30] <tomasm-> rather, to have them in the html that jquery will read
[09:31:53] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: have you been to the legal seafood?
[09:32:01] <erichynds> yeah
[09:32:02] <erichynds> not a fan
[09:32:04] <eddiemonge> ?Attr @ tomasm-
[09:32:04] <bot-t> tomasm-, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[09:32:06] <jeffsmykil> really?
[09:32:12] <jeffsmykil> any particular reason why?
[09:32:13] <erichynds> well it's ok, i've only been there 2ce
[09:32:27] <erichynds> jeffsmykil: i had a fish sandwich and it was so overcooked and dry
[09:32:39] <jeffsmykil> yeah I knew it was pricey
[09:32:41] <tomasm-> eddiemonge, even if it's not standard html? i thought some browsers can ignore them
[09:32:55] <erichynds> that too
[09:33:02] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: maybe the issue was you ordered a fish sandwhich at legal seafood?
[09:33:09] <eddiemonge> tomasm-: use data then see ? data
[09:33:09] <bot-t> tomasm-, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[09:33:19] <jojovem> hmm thanks a lot eddiemonge
[09:33:23] <jojovem> but one question
[09:34:26] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: maybe the chef got offended :)
[09:34:49] <erichynds> hah, could be, that's probably the worst thing on their menu
[09:35:21] <jojovem> i didnt get your code, why is the a tag for?
[09:35:41] <jojovem> so it fires when i click the button?
[09:35:46] <jojovem> and make a different id
[09:35:48] <jojovem> hmm
[09:35:54] <jeffsmykil> also the cheapest erichynds ?
[09:36:12] <erichynds> probably
[09:36:16] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: favorite place to go for breakfest?
[09:36:18] <erichynds> i still remember it being expensive
[09:36:25] <eddiemonge> jojovem: the important thing is the google call that actually renders the button
[09:36:29] <jeffsmykil> yeah their cheapest entre is like 16
[09:36:39] <eddiemonge> i was just showing you how they can be added dynamically
[09:36:57] <erichynds> jeffsmykil: B street in newton, or fire & ice on sundays for brunch which is effing awesome
[09:37:10] <jeffsmykil> is it all you can eat erichynds ?
[09:37:14] <erichynds> yeah
[09:37:53] <jeffsmykil> maybe ill try B Street
[09:37:58] <jeffsmykil> can you take the green line there?
[09:38:04] <phlp> you guys are making me hungry
[09:38:26] <erichynds> jeffsmykil: yeah newton highlands on the D line, it's right there
[09:38:42] <Arrows2606> excuse me, what are you talking about?
[09:38:54] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: I might have to try that on Saturday morning
[09:40:49] <jeffsmykil> Arrows2606: JavaScript of course!
[09:42:02] <defendguin> has anyone used the wijmo tool kit?  I'm wondering why all of their nice charts refuse to work on IE
[09:43:00] <miceiken> okay, so does anyone use fancybox? I need to divide many images on a site into albums
[09:45:09] <Arrows2606> Jeffsmykil: Yeah,
[09:46:13] <Hala> miceiken just use $("a[rel=example_group]").fancybox
[09:46:45] <jeffsmykil> Arrows2606: delicious delicious java script
[09:47:55] <bartek> What causes a large string of html, when wrapped with jQuery $(data.html), to produce an Array of not only the divs (great!), but every second element is a "Text" object with various attributes.
[09:48:12] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: if you are using .when with ajax how does the ajax call know what to return?
[09:48:45] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: because the ajax call wouldnt have success and failure anymore
[09:49:07] <miceiken> Hala, thanks
[09:49:31] <Hala> uw
[09:50:02] <miceiken> Hala, is it possible that fancybox goes by extension and not mimetype? because with the lightbox plugin it loaded the image just fine, but now it loads the image as symbols
[09:50:09] <miceiken> as if you would open an image in notepad
[09:50:32] <Hala> ah
[09:50:37] <jeffsmykil> when i open an image in notepad, I only see the image... like Neo
[09:50:52] <miceiken> lol
[09:50:55] <miceiken> the matrix!
[09:51:16] <Hala> i had it modifyd for myself it wasn't html5 valid so i put the rel in the script
[09:51:24] <Hala> let me find what else  i had done :D
[09:52:17] <miceiken> maybe i need to start working by extensions again :P
[09:52:51] <coreyo> is there a command in js or jquery that allows you to revert a form's element back to its original value without storing that value first?
[09:53:18] <miceiken> works fine when i append .png to the filename Hala =/
[09:53:33] <gnarf> coreyo: what kind of form element?
[09:53:35] <Hala> thats odd
[09:53:39] <jeffsmykil> miceiken: that's a jeffsmykil mistake
[09:53:49] <miceiken> what
[09:54:06] <jeffsmykil> not attaching the file extension
[09:54:14] <miceiken> but
[09:54:15] <gnarf> coreyo: you can try looking at the prop("defaultValue") of the elem
[09:54:24] <miceiken> I dont want file extensions :(
[09:54:38] <gnarf> coreyo: also, there is domform.reset() but that resets everything in the form
[09:55:56] <coreyo> gnarf, I have both a checkbox and a textfield.  I don't want to reset everything, just those field individually.  I'll give prop('defaultValue') a try
[09:57:06] <miceiken> ah
[09:57:13] <miceiken> I solved it, it didnt know what kind of type it was
[09:59:57] <coreyo> gnarf, works like a charm on the textfield, however the checkbox will require something different.  Is there a property for defaultChecked or something like that as well?
[10:02:01] <Dreamstar> Why doesnt this work? :D $("form").submit(function(){ 	$('#fadeIn').hide().fadeIn('slow'); 	 });
[10:02:56] <jojovem> because
[10:03:14] <gnarf> coreyo: yup defaultChecked: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/HTMLInputElement
[10:03:44] <jojovem> why did you put that hide?
[10:04:31] <coreyo> gnarf, excellent, that is working as well
[10:04:36] <coreyo> thank you very much sir!
[10:06:35] <jschoolcraft> I'd like to clone a group of elements then replace some of the element values based on some new value.  I've tried .clone().html().replace("foo", "bar") and that works for text (for an H4) but not for value on a form element.  So how do I basically do a sub-select (or select scoped to the cloned object)?
[10:09:26] <miceiken> Another fancybox question if you guys don't mind. http://me.miceiken.net/2011-10-18_1908.png <- how can I make fancybox automaticly fit the iframe?
[10:12:11] <itatitat> ey
[10:12:35] <itatitat> in jquery for event "change" is....onchange or change?
[10:14:17] <itatitat> I'm doing a cascade options, but the event change dont work....
[10:14:28] <itatitat> any idea?
[10:14:43] <itatitat> why change event dont work?
[10:15:00] <jojovem> change event works on input fields
[10:15:08] <jojovem> whats the problem
[10:15:09] <jojovem> ?
[10:15:22] <itatitat> I've 3 selects in cascade
[10:15:31] <itatitat> my first select work fine
[10:15:55] <itatitat> but my second (it will be activated when I select something in the first, event change)
[10:16:01] <jojovem> the fields from the second select are ajax called?
[10:16:05] <itatitat> but the event change.....dont work
[10:16:09] <itatitat> yes
[10:16:11] <jojovem> you must use live
[10:16:16] <itatitat> live?
[10:16:35] <jojovem> $('.element).live('change')
[10:16:47] <itatitat> oh, thanks!
[10:16:54] <jojovem> because the selects are not in the DOM
[10:16:59] <itatitat> aaaaaah
[10:17:00] <jojovem> when it was first loaded
[10:17:11] <jojovem> live is to get recently added elements
[10:17:19] <itatitat> ah nono, I didn't understand you
[10:17:34] <itatitat> the other selects exists, but they are desactivated
[10:17:50] <kborchers> ?demo @ itatitat
[10:17:51] <bot-t> itatitat, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:18:01] <itatitat> OKOK
[10:18:06] <jojovem> Yes, do tgat
[10:18:10] <jojovem> that*
[10:18:54] <kborchers> jojovem: don't use live, use delegate instead see ?delegate
[10:18:55] <bot-t> jojovem, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/

[10:19:54] <ohsnap> hi
[10:22:31] <itatitat> wow, great tools fiddle
[10:22:35] <itatitat> this is my problem
[10:22:36] <itatitat> http://jsfiddle.net/PkDfH/1/
[10:23:04] <ohsnap> If I have a link with an animation, can I prevent the loading of the next page until the animation has ended?
[10:23:19] <kborchers> ?change @ itatitat
[10:23:19] <bot-t> itatitat, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[10:23:25] <kborchers> not onchange
[10:23:41] <ohsnap> Let's say I click on the element that opens a new page, stop it, wait for the animation that's binded to that element, and then load the next page?
[10:24:18] <kborchers> and you don't need window.onload inside of $(document).ready itatitat
[10:24:52] <itatitat> really?, okok, I thought that, ok, thanks!
[10:29:42] <itatitat> kborchers, already work, thanks a lot
[10:30:00] <kborchers> np :)
[10:35:50] <mikunos> hi guys how have I to get from by the $("ul.catsubnav").parent() the first children <a> link?
[10:38:06] <zeppo> what syntax or regex does jquery use? perl?
[10:38:12] <zeppo> of*
[10:38:23] <BarelyFitz> javascript
[10:38:41] <zeppo> duh
[10:39:41] <necromancer> lol
[10:39:45] <necromancer> js is kinda like pcre
[10:40:04] <necromancer> some more single-char aliases for common expressions
[10:40:05] <mikunos> any suggestion?
[10:40:14] <necromancer> zeppo: look up RegExp on MDN
[10:40:29] <zeppo> haha thanks
[10:40:33] <romankrv>  hi. Hi have some code http://dpaste.com/636690/  how fix it for formatting in js?    i want to use like python format     like    " %s%s " % ('dat1', 'dat2')   it possible in  jquery?
[10:40:46] <ngharo> mikunos: .find('a:first')
[10:40:52] <necromancer> mikunos: parent() returns a jQuery object, you can just chain a .find('a:first') to the end of it
[10:40:56] <mikunos> thanks!!!
[10:41:19] <Gates> Any ideas why the local wp jquery loads in hte header and then the theme loads it in the footer, and only if that is the case does the jquery work
[10:41:25] <necromancer> basically anything but val() and some rule-breaking plugins returns a jQuery object, which means it's chainable
[10:41:32] <Gates> if just the header loads it doesnt work
[10:42:00] <mikunos> ngharo, ops
[10:42:02] <ngharo> romankrv: write a helper method that uses replace()
[10:42:22] <mikunos> ngharo not the first of the list but the first under the selected
[10:42:41] <romankrv> ngharo:  not exist in jquery already?
[10:42:42] <zeppo> Gates: whats in the footer?
[10:42:52] <Gates> im so confused
[10:42:54] <Gates> theres
[10:43:11] <ngharo> mikunos: selected how?
[10:43:15] <Gates> the header is, /js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.6.1
[10:43:40] <Gates> the bottom of the page, /jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js from google
[10:44:13] <zeppo> and you're not loading either yourself?
[10:44:13] <ngharo> romankrv: there are sprintf javascript implementations.  Google it.
[10:44:21] <Gates> only if both load does it work
[10:44:52] <mikunos> ngharo when I click on my menu a little window slide down and I'd like to highlight the first a link above the list slided down
[10:44:58] <Gates> but thats not suppose to happen?!
[10:45:10] <Gates> does the jquery lib have to load first before the rest to make the other scripts work?
[10:45:22] <phlp> Gates: wordpress uses noConflict so you have to use jQuery instead of $
[10:45:32] <Gates> eh?
[10:45:43] <phlp> ? noConflict @ Gates
[10:45:44] <bot-t> Gates, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[10:46:15] <Gates> do i need to use that foreverything
[10:46:39] <Gates> its only js and jquery
[10:46:50] <ngharo> mikunos: got a demo?
[10:47:08] <Gates> hmm ohh phlp it loads that so i need to reset it once to make the default wordpress one to work
[10:47:15] <mikunos> ngharo http://demo.shineisp.com/
[10:47:15] <zeppo> if theres javascript thats relying on jquery it needs to load before anything else
[10:47:20] <zeppo> http://wordpress.org/support/topic/i-want-to-disable-jquery-included-in-wordpress
[10:48:04] <mikunos> ngharo can u see the menu of the categories
[10:48:06] <Gates> hmm
[10:48:11] <Gates> yea im even more confused lol
[10:48:11] <mikunos> ?
[10:48:37] <zeppo> load jquery before anything else
[10:48:50] <zeppo> any other javascript that is
[10:48:54] <mikunos> ngharo: the slide down menu at top of the page
[10:49:32] <mikunos> ngharo solved
[10:49:33] <mikunos> thanks
[10:49:43] <mikunos> $(this).parent().find('a').addClass("cathover");
[10:49:49] <Gates> hmm
[10:50:04] <Gates> if u load more than 1 jquery lib it shouldnt work at all?
[10:50:05] <Gates> right?
[10:50:14] <Gates> cuz my site loads two from google (now) and works?
[10:50:14] <ngharo> mikunos: ok cool :)
[10:50:43] <zeppo> not it will work anyway
[10:51:14] <zeppo> i assume the last one you load is the one is will use
[10:52:59] <Gates> well since its dynamic its a lil harder
[10:53:08] <Gates> now i have 1 loading, its the first js that loads
[10:53:10] <Gates> and it doesnt work =[
[10:53:19] <Gates> jquery 1.6.1
[10:53:36] <Gates> phlp: would noConflict be what will help me
[10:53:45] <jklmnop> is it possible to access the queue for UI tabs?
[10:53:48] <phlp> Gates: what is your code that isnt working
[10:54:04] <Emperorlou> Is there a modal dialog box implementation that comes with plain-jane jquery?
[10:54:15] <Emperorlou> or do I need to add some other plug
[10:54:29] <ngharo> Emperorlou: jquery-ui has one.
[10:54:38] <ngharo> so no, not plain-jane jquery
[10:54:39] <Emperorlou> but its not part of the base package?
[10:54:41] <Emperorlou> kk
[10:54:55] <Gates> phlp: 1 is a slider plugin (nivo)
[10:55:02] <Gates> and another is a custom header
[10:55:07] <Gates> just flips on scroll
[10:55:45] <phlp> is the one that is loading the jquery that comes with wordpress?
[10:57:18] <Gates> thats the one that doesnt work right
[10:57:21] <Gates> and the theme also loads one
[10:57:42] <phlp> use jQuery('a') instead of $('a') read this http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict
[10:58:07] <Gates> but what about the ones that are plugins :|
[10:58:55] <Gates> i added, wp_deregister_script('jquery'); at the top of the function page
[10:59:07] <Gates> and it stripped out the wordpress one .. and now the theme is the only one that loads!
[11:00:10] <Gates> but
[11:00:26] <Gates> haha the plugin uses, jQuery(window).load(function(){
[11:00:59] <Gates> this is so confusing
[11:02:24] <phlp> you should be loading (only one) jquery first at the very top then any plugins after that. if the theme does something other than that i cant help you

[11:08:40] <t0th> what is the best tooltip plugin?
[11:09:17] <khmer> i like qtip2

[11:24:43] <schuranator> anyone here use lawnchair?
[11:24:54] <queso> Is it inappropriate to have multiple $(document).ready(function(){ ... }); declarations?  I have not had a problem doing this before, but am experiencing now a strange behavior such that an event bound only once to an element is being bound twice (as though .ready() were being called twice).  Ideas?
[11:24:59] <t0th> schuranator
[11:25:04] <t0th> what is lawnchair?
[11:25:05] <t0th> ehehe
[11:25:42] <schuranator> t0th: lawnchair is a json strorage script. I'm using it but have a question about passing my data to a url
[11:25:48] <bakers> queso: No I believe that's fine
[11:26:55] <nights> why does this statement work?
[11:26:55] <nights> 	$('#about-to-close-modal').delay(30000).modal('show');
[11:27:01] <nights> the modal shows up immediately
[11:27:06] <nights> im using twitter bootstrap
[11:27:58] <danzik17> queso: Perfectly fine, and they'll be executed in the order that they're declared
[11:28:35] <queso> bakers, danzik17: Okay, thank you -- I will have to keep digging why it's binding the event twice.
[11:32:16] <starsinmypockets> I'm setting width on button elements by attaching a segments = "int" attribute on the button element, then getting that with .attr('segments') and doing some processing, then set width via .width() - does this seem like a good pattern to use to dynamically resize elements?
[11:42:52] <cresten> hello my jQuery friends!
[11:43:01] <cresten> I has question!
[11:43:12] <cresten> :D

[11:50:07] <falieson> http://jsfiddle.net/kfKTn/ my form validation isn't working, can someone give it a look?
[11:50:30] <falieson> it's also passing variables to message-process.php just fine, but not doing it ajax-style
[11:51:09] <mhotwagner> I could use some help queueing up a set of animations, if anyone's got a moment
[11:53:01] <mhotwagner> ehhh?
[11:54:53] <Dreamstar> Why doesnt this work? :D $("form").submit(function(){ 	$('#fadeIn').hide().fadeIn('slow'); 	 });
[11:55:07] <akoumjian> Since jquery-tmpl has been deprecated, what tools are people using to easily merge json data with html snippets?
[11:55:16] <Dreamstar> It doesn't fadein the #fadeIn div when i submit a form
[11:55:23] <davemo> akoumjian: handlebarsjs.com
[11:55:36] <davemo> sorry, http://www.handlebarsjs.com/
[11:55:40] <queso> What is the appropriate way to move options from one select to another select (adding to its existing options, not replacing them)?
[11:55:56] <kswedberg_> Dreamster: when you submit a form, you're reloading the page. you need to prevent the default action and submit programmatically.
[11:56:31] <LakWork> i have an aggregate selector on multiple fields and then i want to filter the results to only those with two specific classes, how can i do that with .filter() ?
[11:56:39] <LakWork> ie $('input[type=text],input[type=radio],input[type=checkbox],select', this.form).filter('.ui-state-error,.input-validation-error')
[11:56:47] <Dreamstar> kswedberg_:  Alright, lets try that out
[11:57:35] <kswedberg_> Dreamster: how are you submitting the form? You can do it with an ajax request.
[11:57:59] <Dreamstar> I submit it with php
[11:58:15] <falieson> Dreamstar:  why do you do .hide().fadeIn() .... .hide() does display:none which is the opposite of whta you want. have you tried it with no .hide() ?
[11:58:41] <Dreamstar> falieson: It works fine without the submit function
[11:58:49] <falieson> Dreamstar: k, ignore me
[11:58:54] <Dreamstar> Well, I dont wanna show it at first. I want to fade it in
[11:59:10] <akoumjian> davemo: Looks very nice. My only conflict is that it uses the same syntax as Django templates. I suppose I could query the templates separately and not run them through a rendering engine, but that seems slow.
[11:59:14] <falieson> Dreamstar: if it works before, it worked
[11:59:25] <Dreamstar> falieson: Alright :p
[11:59:47] <davemo> akoumjian: if you're having problems with the {{ }} you can customize the regex that does the interpolation to offer a different token string
[11:59:51] <falieson> http://jsfiddle.net/kfKTn/1/ my form validation isn't working? :-( the ajax submit doesnt work either. can someone have a look?
[12:00:15] <queso> How can I put two results together?  e.g., $('#select_1').find('option') + $('#select_2').find('option') ?
[12:00:22] <davemo> akoumjian: IIRC django uses {% %}, right?
[12:00:27] <catcher> Hey everyone, having some trouble with this: var $j = jQuery(this); var location = $j.find('a').attr('href');   location keeps coming up 'undefined' when $j is definitely coming up with my div, and there is definitely an a href enclosed in the div. Any ideas?

You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests. These tools allow you to replicate your issue and pres
[12:01:09] <akoumjian> davemo: {% %} is used for conditionals, looping, while {{ }} is used for template variables.
[12:01:27] <davemo> akoumjian: ah yes, now i remember (it's been 18 months since i've done django) :P
[12:01:50] <akoumjian> davemo: No worries. I'm looking at what others are doing.
[12:01:54] <davemo> akoumjian: you should be able to customize handlebars to use something else, like <% %> or whatever else you want to do
[12:02:21] <jeffsmykil> huh didn't realize it js fiddle did ajax calls, what doesnt it do?
[12:02:36] <Dreamstar> kswedberg_: Any suggestions?

[12:06:41] <davemo> akoumjian: yup! :)

[12:13:43] <cresten> hey guys.
[12:13:47] <eddiemonge> wait, what is going on here?
[12:13:52] <cresten> so I use the serialize() thing right/.
[12:14:02] <eddiemonge> kswedberg_: in #jquery helping? i havent seen that in a long time
[12:14:03] <cresten> what am I supposed to do with that weird string?]

[12:14:54] <kswedberg_> Dreamstar: what's the error?

[12:15:28] <mhotwagner> a simple question, but "easeOut" defines the movement at the END of an animation, and "easeIn" overs the opposite, correct?
[12:15:57] <kswedberg_> Dreamstar: oh crap. that's what I get for typing something quickly. remove the semicolon after serialize()
[12:16:11] <lucenut> I'm a newb and am using jquery.validate for requireds, but now I also need some custom validators. Can someone point me in the right direction?

[12:16:58] <lucenut> I have a "confirm" checkbox that I need to validate that the user checks.
[12:17:21] <kborchers> lucenut: this is a custom validator for US phone numbers http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/CustomMethods/phoneUS that should show you how it's done
[12:17:36] <mhotwagner> eddiemonge: what do you mean by 'style'?  As far as I've always understood, it defines some rhythm/variation to an animation
[12:17:51] <mhotwagner> ie: an animation could start quickly and slow down near the end
[12:17:57] <Dreamstar> kswedberg_: Your code doesn't work
[12:17:58] <eddiemonge> mhotwagner: that would be style
[12:17:58] <Dreamstar> hmm
[12:18:31] <mhotwagner> hmm, not sure style's the word I'd choose for that
[12:19:40] <phrearch> hey
[12:19:50] <eddiemonge> Dreamstar: what doesnt work about it? what happens?
[12:19:58] <phrearch> i wonder how to get the target element on which a jquery draggable is dragged upon?

[12:20:06] <Dreamstar> eddiemonge: Nothing happens :D
[12:20:10] <Dreamstar> It submit
[12:20:12] <Planet_EN> is there any way to convert a string containing array in an array with different datatypes to an array? for example string = "[[1,'4'], ['hello',4], ['hello',0.0]]"
[12:20:15] <Dreamstar> That's it
[12:20:25] <gnarf> phrearch: have you looked at the "ui" hash on the event?
[12:20:43] <gnarf> phrearch: also, make the target elements "dropable" and then you'll have events
[12:20:59] <lucenut> OK, so if I'm using the simple class="required" and I don't have $("#myform").validate({... can I still add a validator?
[12:21:19] <tomasm-> hi, how do i properly check a radio button in jquery? lets say I have a field name, will calling $('radiogroupname').val('setvalue') mark the one that has that value?

[12:21:46] <mhotwagner> Planet_EN: you could parse apart the string looking for tokens like brackets and single quotes (regex would be "easiest" (if the word easy can bused with regex))
[12:22:08] <gnarf> phrearch: yeah, you need to make your "targets" dropable
[12:22:18] <gnarf> then you'll get events on the dropables

[12:22:29] <phrearch> gnarf: ok thanks. will give that a try
[12:22:35] <Dreamstar> eddiemonge: Yet it doesnt fadeIn
[12:23:20] <eddiemonge> Dreamstar: does it get populated with the data?
[12:23:42] <Dreamstar> How do you mean?
[12:24:07] <eddiemonge> Planet_EN: how do you get that string initially?
[12:24:31] <Planet_EN> gets returns from an api call..
[12:24:36] <eddiemonge> Dreamstar: i mean does does the element with id fadeIn get populated with the data? inspect it to see
[12:24:54] <eddiemonge> Planet_EN: the api isnt returning json or xml?
[12:26:10] <Planet_EN> well json requires all the datatypes to be the same type, in this case it just can't be..

[12:27:31] <eddiemonge> anand: you mean like localhost?

[12:28:10] <Dreamstar> Yes
[12:28:15] <Dreamstar> or wait
[12:28:20] <anand> eddiemonge: like localhost, but one that I know is working correctly :)  my localhost setup is throwing 500 internal errors on JQuery GETs, and I want to make sure the syntax of the request is correct
[12:28:26] <Dreamstar> Havent checked in firebug

[12:31:17] <anand> the destination page of the GET request?
[12:31:26] <anand> or the page that's hosting the jQuery?
[12:31:37] <eddiemonge> the page with the scrip ton it
[12:31:51] <anand> I'm just running it in my browser console
[12:31:55] <kswedberg_> Dreamstar: nm. you're inserting the returned html into the #fadeIn element.
[12:32:09] <Dreamstar> yea

[12:32:50] <tomasm-> hi, if i have a field named data[thing][var], how do I select that in jquery, ie input[name=???] ? how would I escape the inner brackets?
[12:32:54] <eddiemonge> Dreamstar: whats the css show in firebug? if you just do $('#fadeIn').show(); without the ajax call does the element become visible?
[12:32:55] <gar_onn> got $.post(....,function(resp){},...) in a method of a object, how do I get the this (or an other name) in the function to be the object?
[12:32:59] <kswedberg_> Dreamstar: so, after this line: $fadeIn.html(response).fadeIn('slow');  … try logging the contents to your console: console.log( $fadeIn.html());
[12:33:08] <eddiemonge> anand: it may be a case of  see ? sop
[12:33:09] <bot-t> anand, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[12:33:33] <kswedberg_> Dreamstar: we need to be sure it's actually populating the element with the response.
[12:33:48] <falieson> anyone familiar with boxy? $('#popout').hide('fast');  isn't actually closing it, it's just minimizing it down to the title bar
[12:33:49] <eddiemonge> gar_onn: save the object as a variable and then call it in the function
[12:34:00] <anand> eddiemonge: Actually, I'm trying to debug a SOP fix that I implemented, but I don't even know how to check what headers or data the server is returning in jQuery. in Curl I see it's returning headers correctly
[12:34:26] <eddiemonge> anand: look in chromes inspector or firebug to see the headers
[12:34:39] <gar_onn> eddiemonge,  but, the will be multiple of the object, so I don't want a messy global
[12:34:41] <kswedberg_> Dreamstar: also, if you have something like <div id="fadeIn" style="display: none !important"></div> the .fadeIn('slow') won't work.
[12:34:54] <anand> eddiemonge: can I do that even if I invoke in the console, or do I have to embed in a page and run it?
[12:35:14] <Dreamstar> kswedberg_: I just have it like this, <div id="fadeIn">data</dib>
[12:35:42] <kswedberg_> Dreamstar: ok, that looks fine, as long as you meant …</div>
[12:35:51] <Dreamstar> :D
[12:36:12] <Dreamstar> the console.log didnt return anything..
[12:36:14] <eddiemonge> gar_onn: i didnt say a global var. do it right before your post call
[12:36:27] <eddiemonge> Dreamstar: do you have a live link for this?
[12:36:59] <Dreamstar> eddiemonge: No, I dont. Im sorry
[12:37:06] <eddiemonge> anand: you can do it in the console
[12:37:28] <eddiemonge> Dreamstar: then can you paste your html, css and all the script?
[12:37:53] <eddiemonge> Dreamstar: actually if the console didnt return anything then it sounds like your ajax is failing
[12:38:04] <Dreamstar> Yea
[12:38:25] <kswedberg_> Dreamstar: open up the console and look at the Network tab. After you submit the form, inspect the file that appears.
[12:38:26] <eddiemonge> what is the response code you are getting back? is it a 200 or something else?
[12:38:26] <anand> eddiemonge: great, thanks a ton. i see how to do it now! you're a hero
[12:38:47] <kswedberg_> eddiemonge: you've always been my hero! :)
[12:39:17] <eddiemonge> kswedberg_: you are my hero. all that documentation. so sexy
[12:39:31] <eddiemonge> kswedberg_: im eddie by the way ;)

[12:41:31] <starsinmypockets> ... line two is adding 1 to shiftSegments stringwise and I want to add 1 int-wise...
[12:41:36] <falieson> eddiemonge: any idea?
[12:42:17] <starsinmypockets> any idea what I'm doing wrong? (shiftSegments += 1) has the same result (ie, 4 += 1 == 41)
[12:42:38] <Dreamstar> wow kswedberg_
[12:42:46] <Dreamstar> It worked with another form now
[12:42:55] <Dreamstar> but not the form i want
[12:42:56] <Dreamstar> :D
[12:43:04] <kswedberg_> Dreamstar: ha!
[12:43:05] <eddiemonge> starsinmypockets: thats because its adding strings and not numbers
[12:43:12] <Dreamstar> Thats odd
[12:43:35] <eddiemonge> Dreamstar: if you submit the form without ajax what happens?
[12:43:38] <falieson> $('#message-wrapper').Boxy.hide('fast'); is wrong... whta should it be?
[12:43:41] <starsinmypockets> eddiemonge - shiftSegments == 4
[12:43:55] <Dreamstar> eddiemonge: It submits
[12:44:03] <Dreamstar> Same thing as if I had ajax
[12:44:20] <kswedberg_> Dreamstar: yes, it is odd. if you inspect that file request in the console, check out the Response tab and the Post tab (or whatever; depends on which browser)
[12:44:22] <t0th> any use tooltip from flowplayer. ?:

[12:51:40] <dmemdfd> Hi all. Is it possible to initialize a selectable set of elements with a specific list of elements to be displayed as selected on startup? Couldn't find anything about this on google.

[12:54:13] <Whirl3d> Hello all, if you use the selector: $(someclass).siblings().next(), what order would the subset $(someclass).siblings() be in? would $(someclass).siblings().first()==$(someclass).first() ?

[12:58:06] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: that is a weird selector
[12:58:19] <Whirl3d> eddiemonge, how so?
[12:58:42] <Whirl3d> eddiemonge, thanks for the reply

[12:59:51] <tomasm-> is there a way to add a handler to a radio button that will trigger even when the value is set (checked) via val() ?
[13:00:24] <eddiemonge> tomasm-: the value and the selected state are separate
[13:00:48] <tomasm-> eddiemonge, not when you pass an array to val()
[13:01:48] <Whirl3d> eddiemonge, how do I override the .next() and .prev() selectors to wrap easily? In other words: $(someclass).last().next()==[] but I want $(someclass).last().next()=$(someclass).first()...for example
[13:02:19] <Whirl3d> not that you would ever use that selector, but just to demonstrate, the point
[13:02:33] <n8o-mba> eddict: thanks!
[13:02:38] <n8o-mba> err, eddiemonge
[13:02:42] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: you know that last is last so instead just call first
[13:03:04] <eddiemonge> tomasm-: oh. i never use it that way
[13:03:05] <Whirl3d> right, I used .last to demonstrate. I won't actually use .last...just .next
[13:03:18] <dmemdfd> Hi all. Is it possible to initialize a selectable set of elements with a specific list of elements to be displayed as selected on startup?
[13:03:31] <Whirl3d> and when it gets to the last, I need it to return the first....should be able to override

[13:09:35] <celloflax> InDigital, Jquery UI has a normal calendar.. I need a calendar which extends only in horizontal
[13:10:08] <InDigital> make byself :)
[13:10:13] <InDigital> hehe
[13:10:18] <celloflax> so in three month i'll have a 90 div (more or less) in horizontal for every row
[13:11:00] <Whirl3d> eddiemonge, thanks for the reply. How do I override the default behavior of jquery for .next()?
[13:11:05] <smplstk> axel: also: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/Dbz6y/14/
[13:11:08] <smplstk> something like that
[13:11:18] <smplstk> you'll need to use an array to store the value of each of them.

[13:23:43] <celloflax> that could help me
[13:24:00] <eddiemonge> celloflax: so what you want is a carousel type calendar. basically you want google calendar

[13:27:04] <celloflax> eddict, I don't have a live example ti show you i'm sorry.. Because i have to do it ;)
[13:27:30] <celloflax> sorry was for eddiemonge
[13:27:46] <celloflax> eddiemonge, I don't have a live example ti show you i'm sorry.. Because i have to do it ;)
[13:27:58] <eddiemonge> RobertPlummer: its more about the idea of how its done since you cant really do it straight up unless you do something like append an iframe
[13:27:58] <RobertPlummer> eddiemonge: nm, I got it.
[13:28:30] <eddiemonge> celloflax: i said a mockup. like a wireframe or a graphical representation

[13:31:55] <celloflax> i'll try
[13:31:55] <keybo> but firebug says theres a syntax error
[13:32:17] <keybo> oh wait i think i see what i've done wrong
[13:32:25] <keybo> think my if is in the wrong place :P

[13:34:41] <MrPink_> Hello, How can I add HTML Code with JQuery? I want to add some Headers into a form, in between Input Boxes to group the form a little.. but somehow it wrecks my form....

[13:38:32] <MrPink_> and then continue on with the same form
[13:38:40] <keybo> yep the if was wrong, thanks any guys
[13:39:20] <kinga> hi, i have a question, i never used 'this' keyword very often
[13:39:40] <MrPink_> eddiemonge: http://pastebin.com/fwV8ixvz here is the code I am using so far, if that helps
[13:39:55] <zamba> how do i make a a href visible after a while? i basically need to toggle a class that makes a text clickable
[13:40:12] <kinga> if i have for example: $('span').each(function(i,item){}) in the anonymous' function if i want to append something to span i would use this.appendTo() ?
[13:40:22] <phlp> MrPink_: $('#name').after('<h1>test</h1>');
[13:40:56] <MrPink_> that looks simple enough... Hadn't seen .after  let me check it out
[13:41:57] <kinga> or let me rephrase it
[13:42:12] <kinga> in $('span').each(function(i,item){}), is this == $('span') ?
[13:42:19] <MrPink_> phlp: works like a charm... thanks so much
[13:42:23] <kinga> this beeing inside the anonymous function
[13:42:26] <kinga> being*
[13:43:16] <kinga> ah nevermind, im stupid lol
[13:43:32] <airic82> Hi! I'm having trouble debugging an AJAX call using jQuery and was wondering if someone might be able to help me.
[13:43:53] <airic82> I tried using a try-catch block, but the error description comes up "undefined"
[13:44:33] <keybo> going back to my hover problem - when i hover it animates to change position very slightly, and when it is clicked it adds a class
[13:44:50] <keybo> what is supposed to happen is if that class is present the hover function should be disabled
[13:45:22] <keybo> but its not checking for the class on mouseout so when i hover, click and then move the mouse away the element still moves even though my stop class is present
[13:45:48] <keybo> i hope i explained that well enough but can anybody please help me fix this?
[13:46:44] <dafireball> hi guys, if I have 6 list items, 2 per row, what selector can I use to do $('list items 0 and 1 per row').each() ?
[13:47:35] <dafireball> or isn't that possible?
[13:48:39] <eddiemonge> deppends on your markup
[13:49:08] <keybo> actually again
[13:49:09] <airic82> does anyone have any ideas how i can figure out what is causing the error? thanks!
[13:49:16] <keybo> stupid error on my part lol
[13:49:31] <keybo> was putting the full stop in the class when checking with hasClass:(
[13:50:02] <eddiemonge> airic82: whats the problem?
[13:50:35] <airic82> I'm making an AJAX call and somewhere the JavaScript quits, but I'm not sure where
[13:50:42] <airic82> so I put a try-catch block in
[13:51:08] <airic82> and in catch i have "alert(err.Description)", but it just says "undefined" so I have no idea what is throwing the error
[13:51:26] <dafireball> eddiemonge, that are list items, float left (no class names) and after 2 list items there is a span class clearfix.
[13:51:28] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ airic82
[13:51:28] <bot-t> airic82, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[13:51:52] <airic82> eddiemonge: what's ?pe
[13:52:04] <eddiemonge> dafireball: you <ul><li></li><li></li><span /><li></li><li></li></ul>?
[13:52:22] <dafireball> eddiemonge: correct
[13:52:23] <eddiemonge> airic82: its what i ask bot-t to tell you
[13:52:30] <eddiemonge> dafireball: thats not very valid markup
[13:53:08] <kinga> $('span').each(function(i,item){}) item is of type HtmlElement
[13:53:12] <kinga> isn't that inconsistent ?
[13:53:22] <kinga> shouldn't it be a jquery element ?
[13:53:33] <dafireball> eddiemonge: ok, what do you suggest when I have to do the selector?
[13:53:45] <kinga> as long as $('span') is
[13:53:53] <eddiemonge> dafireball: i mean you cant have the span in the ul
[13:54:08] <eddiemonge> kinga: no.

[13:54:55] <kinga> ok
[13:55:01] <kinga> but i still think it's inconsistent
[13:55:26] <airic82> eddiemonge: not sure what you want me to paste and how to share it with you.
[13:55:28] <Sazpaimon> I have a table with multiple <td> elements, some of them containing tables themselves, also with <td> elements. If I select the root table, how do I get, say, the third <td> element without diving into the subtables
[13:55:28] <eddiemonge> kinga: its not. its just like .click(function() { this }) where this refers to the dom element
[13:55:46] <geo> In jQuery, is there a way to manually propagate an event onto a DOM object?
[13:55:47] <kinga> ok then
[13:56:05] <eddiemonge> dafireball: why not use a table because it sounds like you are making one
[13:56:22] <geo> nope I'm not making a table
[13:56:29] <airic82> eddiemonge: nevermind. here: http://jsfiddle.net/RrcbV/1/
[13:56:40] <LiVECrys> Whats the simplest way to display this in my jqtouch app? http://174.34.147.190/~planet92/split_metadata/nowplaying.php
[13:56:48] <eddiemonge> geo: do what?
[13:57:41] <geo> eddiemonge: I know mouseenter works such that it propagates mouseovers to all the elements in DOM to which mouseenter was bound to rite?
[13:59:03] <Sazpaimon> Anyone? I know I've done this before, but cannot remember how
[13:59:13] <eddiemonge> airic82: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/RrcbV/4/
[13:59:24] <yedimind> Sazpaimon, dont build sites with tables
[13:59:33] <yedimind> $('table td').eq(3)
[13:59:45] <yedimind> will get the 3rd td of the tabel

[14:00:02] <eddiemonge> geo mouseover is fired whenever the mouse moves over an element
[14:00:21] <Sazpaimon> yedimind, I'm making a greasemonkey script, no control over the site design
[14:00:31] <Sazpaimon> and won't that select the third td including any sub-tables?

[14:01:32] <yedimind> 'table > td'
[14:01:45] <airic82> eddiemonge: thanks, but that's still throwing an error. How am I supposed to figure out why?
[14:01:53] <eddiemonge> yedimind: that wont work since td is not a direct child of tables
[14:01:56] <kinga> images aren't being retrieved from the server when making a img element (with href attribute set) and appending it somewhere in the document ?

[14:02:04] <kinga> i'm getting blanks :(
[14:02:10] <mbtez> someone please remind me how to list the binded events for an element
[14:02:39] <eddiemonge> kinga:  images are src, not href
[14:02:45] <airic82> eddiemonge: the alert in the catch block just says "[object Object]"
[14:02:57] <eddiemonge> mbtez: .date('events')
[14:02:57] <kinga> ah god damn it, thanks :)
[14:03:07] <kinga> stupid mistake
[14:03:07] <eddiemonge> airic82: dont use a catch block. its useless there
[14:03:08] <mbtez> what?
[14:03:24] <eddiemonge> airic82: use what i have and switch the alerts with console.logs
[14:03:33] <eddiemonge> mbtez: .data('events')
[14:04:50] <airic82> eddiemonge: I'm sorry. i misspoke. The error block is saying "[object Object]"
[14:04:53] <Sazpaimon> its still selecting all sub <tr> and <td> tags
[14:05:07] <Sazpaimon> not the ones exclusive to the table I'm selecting
[14:05:13] <eddiemonge> airic82: still, do what i said. then you can see what it actually is
[14:05:16] <mbtez> got it thanks
[14:05:23] <eddiemonge> Sazpaimon: did you use my code?
[14:05:40] <Sazpaimon> eddiemonge, I did, $('table').find('>tr').find('>td') returned a 0 length
[14:05:52] <phlp> probably has tbody
[14:05:57] <Sazpaimon> then tried yedimind's code, and it didnt work
[14:06:03] <phlp> $('table td').not('table table td')
[14:06:18] <eddiemonge> airic82: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/RrcbV/8/
[14:06:36] <Sazpaimon> that did it, thanks phlp
[14:06:36] <yedimind> Sazpaimon, testcase it
[14:07:46] <airic82> eddiemonge: ok... but where does it output the console.log info to?

[14:16:16] <chovy> howdy
[14:17:52] <catcher> hey y'all, I'm using a jquery tooltip that pops up a big white transparent box - I need the whole box to link to a dynamically-generated location, and still running into issues. What's the best approach?
[14:18:42] <chovy> in jquery-ui, I have a sortable list whose items are also droppable for something else, when I drag a sortable item the ui-state-hover for the droppable triggers when I drag a sortable item over a sibling item that is sortable.
[14:19:08] <mhotwagner> catcher: what do you mean you need the whole box to "link"?  That when you click on the box, it opens a page, or that the box itself is populated by info from another location?
[14:19:10] <chovy> i don't think that should be happening.
[14:19:40] <catcher> mhotwagner, sorry - I mean the whole box is an active link that redirects to a new page when clicked.
[14:20:33] <mhotwagner> catcher, are there also items inside the box itself that has to be clickable?
[14:20:43] <mhotwagner> *have
[14:21:05] <catcher> mhotwagner, there is text, but I'd prefer the whole box is active rather than just the text.
[14:24:01] <mhotwagner> well
[14:24:30] <mhotwagner> is the box itself a div?
[14:25:14] <catcher> Yes, though it's being used as a manual trigger for the tooltip (http://flowplayer.org/tools/tooltip/index.html)
[14:25:38] <miceiken> does jquery support opacity: 0 instead of display: none for functions like show and hide?
[14:26:44] <spal> Just like remove which can be used as: $('#anyID').remove(), is there a function that is the opposite of remove?
[14:27:42] <catcher> Here's the code - the tooltip works, the click handler does not
[14:27:42] <eddiemonge> miceiken: you can animate them or use .css
[14:27:43] <catcher> http://jsfiddle.net/ES2CA/
[14:27:51] <mhotwagner> well, unless I'm misunderstanding something $('#divID').click(function() { document.location = 'http://www.someURL.com'; });
[14:28:17] <eddiemonge> spal: to add an element? $('<div />').appendTo(selector)
[14:28:27] <mhotwagner> or, to grab it in a new tab/element,:
[14:28:33] <eddiemonge> mhotwagner: i like window.location
[14:28:39] <miceiken> catcher my code doesnt seem tho work tho, im using fancybox. does it have something to do with the html being loaded into the dom later ?
[14:28:55] <spal> What does $('<div />') correspond to in the HTML?
[14:28:59] <spal> oh, I get it.
[14:28:59] <catcher> mhotwagner, I'm using an alert for now since the redirect isn't working..
[14:29:05] <spal> ignore that.
[14:29:17] <mhotwagner> $('#divID').click(function() { window.open('http://someurl.com') });
[14:29:20] <eddiemonge> spal: it creates a new div element
[14:29:35] <spal> yes, I got it. thank you.
[14:29:40] <mhotwagner> catcher: have you tried the sort of redirect I just suggested?
[14:30:07] <catcher> mhotwagner, yes, can't even get the click handler to fire atm though
[14:30:35] <mhotwagner> hmm
[14:31:10] <mhotwagner> catcher: you're sure you've got the id right?  Are you sticking them in the $(document).ready() handler?
[14:32:00] <catcher> mhotwagner, this is all in the document.ready() handler. Trying an ID instead of class (again, didn't work last time I tried)
[14:32:49] <mhotwagner> catcher: what browser are you using?
[14:33:05] <catcher> mhotwagner, FF mostly, testing on chrome occasionally
[14:33:37] <mhotwagner> catcher: do you have firebug installed?
[14:34:28] <catcher> mhotwagner, I do indeed.. can't get to the breakpoint to really use it though since the event handler won't fire.
[14:34:35] <eddiemonge> catcher: this code: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/ES2CA/1/ ?
[14:36:30] <Whirl3d> Will  $(someItem).first()==$(someItem) if $(someItem) is the first in its scope? And if so, would $(someItem).first().not($(someItem)) select the first item not someItem?
[14:36:39] <Whirl3d> wow that was ugly, sorry
[14:37:05] <mhotwagner> catcher: I see that tooltip has the option to set the class using a variable called toolClass.  ARe you using that?
[14:37:28] <eddiemonge> yes and no
[14:37:30] <catcher> mhotwagner, I'm using the default class, which is just called .tooltip (which I am using)
[14:37:57] <catcher> Error: syntax errorSource File: jquery_tooltipLink.js Line: 2, Column: 8 Source Code:function($){
[14:38:02] <catcher> hmm..
[14:38:12] <catcher> oops, my fault -
[14:39:34] <catcher> mhotwagner, same results - tooltip pops up, click is ignored
[14:39:49] <catcher> (thanks for trying so far btw!)
[14:39:53] <mhotwagner> hmmm
[14:40:20] <eddiemonge> catcher: please paste your new code or a link to your site
[14:40:29] <catcher> kk
[14:41:10] <BinaryKitten> Whirl3d want to retry ?
[14:41:21] <Whirl3d> BinaryKitten, thanks.
[14:41:57] <BinaryKitten> Whirl3d 1st .. what is "someitem"
[14:42:05] <mhotwagner> catcher, on the documentation page you sent me from flowplayer.org, I ran $('.tooltip').click(function() alert('test'))
[14:42:14] <mhotwagner> catcher, and the trigger worked
[14:42:21] <mhotwagner> when I click, I get the alert
[14:42:35] <Whirl3d> BinaryKitten, it's a jquery Collection, usually one item...$(".buttonClass.active")
[14:42:38] <Whirl3d> for example.
[14:42:57] <catcher> http://jsfiddle.net/ES2CA/4/
[14:43:02] <BinaryKitten> Whirl3d a jquery object is always an array wrapper
[14:43:13] <Whirl3d> right.
[14:43:25] <Whirl3d> But sometimes, it can be an array of one element
[14:43:29] <BinaryKitten> yes
[14:43:35] <BinaryKitten> but 1 item != array
[14:43:58] <BinaryKitten> eg $(selector).first() != $(selector)
[14:43:58] <Whirl3d> Sorry, I am never sure how semantically perfect I need to be to ask a question here.
[14:44:09] <eddiemonge> catcher: what is this part ->   [title]
[14:44:27] <Whirl3d> $(selector).first()===$(selector)[0]?
[14:44:31] <keybo> if i have a click event on an element but i have a button inside that element how do i stop the parents click event from firing when the button is clicked?
[14:44:43] <catcher> eddiemonge, That just tells the tooltip which part of the element to use as the text
[14:44:44] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: that would be checking against the dom element
[14:44:53] <catcher> Hi Jana,
[14:44:57] <catcher> oops :)
[14:44:59] <BinaryKitten> Whirl3d actually, that again won't match
[14:45:03] <eddiemonge> ?stoppropagation @ keybo
[14:45:03] <bot-t> keybo, event.stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[14:45:10] <BinaryKitten> since .first returns a query object
[14:45:30] <BinaryKitten> lets work back and get an overview of what you want to achieve Whirl3d
[14:45:34] <eddiemonge> catcher: so it overrides jqueries selector engine?
[14:46:00] <keybo> eddiemonge: thanks :D
[14:46:00] <catcher> eddiemonge, Hate to admit it, but I'm just blindly following the documentation there - that's just what the example showed me to do.
[14:46:20] <Whirl3d> BinaryKitten, thanks for your help. I am trying to select the "next" element in a list of elements from a key position
[14:46:26] <catcher> eddiemonge, could that possibly be trumping the click function handler somehow?
[14:46:56] <Whirl3d> $(".buttonClass.active") is the "active" button that gives us the key index
[14:47:16] <BinaryKitten> ok
[14:47:21] <eddiemonge> catcher: where does it show to do that?
[14:47:38] <keybo> ?next
[14:47:39] <bot-t> .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[14:47:45] <Whirl3d> $(".buttonClass.active").next() works, but I want to select the first if the $(".buttonClass.active") is the last element
[14:48:13] <catcher> eddiemonge, http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/tooltip/index.html
[14:48:23] <Whirl3d> So, I was wondering if there would ever be a case where $(".buttonClass.active") would be the $(".buttonClass").first()
[14:48:35] <Whirl3d> or $(".buttonClass").last()
[14:48:43] <BinaryKitten> yep probably
[14:48:58] <BinaryKitten> but not directly
[14:49:08] <Whirl3d> So then I need to select $(".buttonClass").last().not('.buttonClass.active');
[14:49:26] <Whirl3d> or $(".buttonClass").first().not(".buttonClass.active");
[14:49:47] <BinaryKitten> var item = $('.buttonClass.active'); if (!item.is(':last')) { item = item.next(); }
[14:50:21] <catcher> eddiemonge, it grabs the title from the first element, working okay
[14:50:47] <mhotwagner> off now
[14:50:49] <mhotwagner> good luck guys!
[14:51:58] <Whirl3d> var itemNext=$(".buttonClass.active").next().length?$(".buttonClass.active").next():$(".buttonClass.active").first();
[14:56:11] <Whirl3d> BinaryKitten, will the above selector work?  It appears to in some basic tests, but I wasn't sure if it would break in some cases...I figured you might know..or knowif its bad form...etc.
[14:56:41] <BinaryKitten> why not use what i suggested?
[14:56:49] <BinaryKitten> less code
[14:56:52] <BinaryKitten> and less confusing
[14:57:12] <anand> I'm making a JQuery JSON AJAX call, but I don't get back all the parameters I get back from the identical CURL call. How can I debug what's going on?
[14:57:15] <Whirl3d> yours doesn't wrap?
[14:57:24] <BinaryKitten> ?
[14:57:25] <Whirl3d> It only selects the next item if it's not the last
[14:57:33] <Whirl3d> mine selects the first item if not the last
[14:57:38] <Whirl3d> * if it's the last
[14:57:48] <BinaryKitten> so you want the 1st item
[14:57:52] <BinaryKitten> unless it's the last item
[14:58:07] <BinaryKitten> ?
[14:58:18] <Whirl3d> If the last item is the "active" item, the "next" item would be the first item.
[14:58:38] <Whirl3d> If the first item is the "active" item, the "prev" item would be the last item'
[14:58:50] <BinaryKitten> ah
[14:58:51] <BinaryKitten> i see
[14:59:02] <Whirl3d> with your selector, if it's the last item, it's the last item
[14:59:14] <BinaryKitten> right
[15:00:08] <BinaryKitten> var item = $('.buttonClass.active'); if (item.is(':last')) { item = item.first(); } else { item = item.next(); }
[15:00:09] <Whirl3d> So you could change yours to var item=$(".buttonClass.active"); if (item.is(":last") {return (item.first());}return(item.next())(;
[15:00:14] <anand> how can I see the full set of headers returned by an AJAX call?
[15:01:26] <Whirl3d> BinaryKitten, ironically, the exact same number of characters. LOL
[15:01:38] <BinaryKitten> but more succinct
[15:01:58] <context> uhh wth
[15:02:15] <BinaryKitten> context can we have some please with that wth?
[15:02:32] <context> oh nm
[15:02:41] <context> i was questioning your :last, frst(), next()
[15:02:49] <context> just want to continuesly loop items
[15:03:17] <BinaryKitten> context if you do
[15:03:21] <BinaryKitten> just check last
[15:03:33] <context> i dont need to
[15:03:42] <BinaryKitten> i would probably use index myself for a proper loop
[15:04:10] <BinaryKitten> eg start at 0 if i = length, i = 0
[15:04:11] <BinaryKitten> etc
[15:04:17] <BinaryKitten> and then use .eq
[15:07:36] <catcher> Click handler working! Can someone direct me towards selecting a php-dynamically-generated list of hrefs?
[15:07:46] <catcher> I can get to the div just fine, but need to get a new href for each item.

[15:14:37] <timpa> ngharo: flash based, isnt it?
[15:15:58] <BinaryKitten> why is it rook?
[15:16:36] <rook> Are there any horizontal accordions that work with IE9 that are backwards compatible? IE9 simply won't cooperate with an internal pagelet in a PeopleSoft environ and I'm limited on real estate
[15:16:58] <rook> And I have a wordy client.
[15:17:36] <BinaryKitten> Horizontal Accordion eh?
[15:17:45] <BinaryKitten> they're tricky to get right in any browser
[15:18:09] <rook> Sadly, yes. My other option are tabs, but she isn't keen on the ikdea
[15:18:16] <rook> idea, either.
[15:18:48] <BinaryKitten> other than tabs, what about vertical menu controlled switching area
[15:19:05] <karlsberg87> Hello, im using Jquery Mobile on Android/Iphone and im fighting with JQM because in mys media queries hdpi mdpi ldpi CSS files im trying change the page FONT-SIZE of all UI elemets, but i cant find the solution i try body { font-size: 2em } but only increase my texts not the UI elements texts
[15:19:30] <rook> Browser of choice, IE - supported browser for PeopleSoft IE8 - University distributes systems with... IE9! So today has been glorious.
[15:19:54] <BinaryKitten> heh
[15:19:59] <BinaryKitten> had that issue
[15:20:09] <BinaryKitten> "No we don't need IE6 support"    6 weeks later

[15:20:33] <rook> karls: have you tried percents in your CSS?
[15:20:46] <mbtez> IE = SATAN
[15:20:53] <BinaryKitten> IE != Satan
[15:21:31] <bart> hi!
[15:21:42] <BinaryKitten> I really wish people would stop dissing IE. It's software people, deal with it. If you can't learn to deal with it get a different line of work
[15:21:53] <Guest85246> how to check if $(this) is a form (or any element) ?
[15:21:55] <BinaryKitten> you don't have to like it, but just stop whining please !
[15:22:06] <ngharo> ?is @ Guest85246
[15:22:06] <bot-t> Guest85246, .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[15:22:20] <Guest85246> ngharo: duh! :) thanks
[15:22:24] <BinaryKitten> $(this).is('form') @ bart / Guest85246
[15:22:35] <Guest85246> hi BinaryKitten :)
[15:22:42] <karlsberg87> rook i try body font-size: NN%
[15:23:04] <BinaryKitten> karlsberg87 is your css loading before or after teh jquery mobile css?
[15:23:06] <ravenzz> karlsberg87 demo?
[15:23:42] <karlsberg87> ok
[15:23:47] <karlsberg87> go create a demo
[15:24:03] <bartmax> in a pluing return this.each(function() {}) bla bla... what's the best practices to execute 2 different ffunction if obj is an anchor or a form, for example ?
[15:24:45] <BinaryKitten> bartmax don't
[15:24:53] <BinaryKitten> check in the 1 function
[15:24:56] <bartmax> ok, what do you suggest ?
[15:25:01] <ravenzz> if ($(this).is('form')) { foo(); }
[15:25:03] <BinaryKitten> and do something appropriate
[15:25:19] <bartmax> BinaryKitten: ok
[15:25:44] <DrkShadow> How can I select descendents of a node? I want 'a' objects 3-4 levels underneath div.base
[15:25:59] <BinaryKitten> eg return this.each(function() {  switch (this.nodeName) { case 'form': ..... }    })
[15:25:59] <skamikaze> ?find @ DrkShadow
[15:26:00] <bot-t> DrkShadow, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[15:26:22] <DrkShadow> skamikaze: so, the reason is that I want to .live() them, which I'm guessing won't work with .find.-
[15:26:38] <BinaryKitten> .live them?
[15:26:42] <skamikaze> ?delegate @ DrkShadow
[15:26:43] <bot-t> DrkShadow, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[15:27:07] <context> is delegate different from live ?
[15:27:13] <BinaryKitten> $(nodeselector).delegate('a', 'click', function() {});
[15:27:18] <BinaryKitten> context yes
[15:27:23] <BinaryKitten> live searches whole dom
[15:27:29] <DrkShadow> ok. That's what I'm looking for. Thanks.
[15:27:33] <context> no live gets attached to an element
[15:27:35] <skamikaze> yvw
[15:27:37] <BinaryKitten> delegate searches within the selector
[15:27:45] <skamikaze> live gets attached to document.body
[15:27:45] <context> you can do that to live also
[15:27:49] <BinaryKitten> context no, live searches the whole dom
[15:28:00] <context> $('blah', $('parent')).live()
[15:28:04] <BinaryKitten> it listens for new items within the WHOLE dom
[15:28:12] <context> ?live
[15:28:13] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[15:28:20] <context> :/
[15:28:21] <BinaryKitten> context nd that example is bad..
[15:29:05] <context> oh :x
[15:29:08] <DrkShadow> well actually I'm back to the same point. I have a div.base that will come and go, so I start with $(document).find('div.base').delegate('a.linkIwant', blah, blah). How can I specify multiple levels ?
[15:29:11] <context> guess ill be changing my code
[15:29:24] <context> drkshadow: multiple levels ?
[15:29:32] <BinaryKitten> think about live and delegate as this,   live checks the whole room for when new cups
[15:29:35] <DrkShadow> context: er? I don't know the $('', $('')) format..
[15:29:38] <BinaryKitten> delegate checks the table
[15:30:08] <BinaryKitten> DrkShadow  2nd param is a context  eg what to search within
[15:30:25] <BinaryKitten> it really shouldn't be a new jquery object
[15:30:29] <DrkShadow> hmm.. still won't do it without writing a wrapper function..
[15:30:31] <karlsberg87> BinaryKitten, rook http://jsfiddle.net/EZrS5/4/
[15:31:06] <DrkShadow> I wan't to do this: $(document).find('div.base').delegate('a.linkIwant', blah, blah) -- but without running that line every time an element is created to see. I need to be able to specify descendants to match..
[15:31:10] <BinaryKitten> eg $('selector', this) = fine   $('selector', previouslyFoundItem) = fine  $('selector', $('otherselector')) != fine
[15:31:13] <karlsberg87> I want up and down ALL texts font size for high density screens, low and medium (Adjust the font size for each mobile)
[15:31:37] <BinaryKitten> DrkShadow that's what delegate does
[15:31:49] <BinaryKitten> also start direct with div.base
[15:31:54] <DrkShadow> binarykitten: but I need to select descendants of descendants.
[15:31:59] <skamikaze> sry gotta correct myself, live binds to $(document)
[15:32:02] <DrkShadow> binarykitten: div.base may not be there.
[15:32:08] <BinaryKitten> right..
[15:32:24] <BinaryKitten> then you need to adjust your selector
[15:32:27] <BinaryKitten> and your parent
[15:32:28] <DrkShadow> binarykitten: so $('div.base').descendants(...) is fine if $('div.base') returns nothing?
[15:32:30] <Aquaguy> Hey there
[15:33:01] * DrkShadow tests
[15:33:11] <BinaryKitten> DrkShadow  if there are no commonality lower than document
[15:33:18] <rook> karls: looking
[15:33:18] <BinaryKitten> then you can use live without worry
[15:33:20] <Aquaguy> does jQuery when a dragging start load the droppable element's position and size to know when to add the droppable class?
[15:33:25] <BinaryKitten> if there is, use delegate
[15:33:53] <BinaryKitten> $('div.base a.linkIwant').live(......)
[15:34:16] <DrkShadow> binary: I have the document, with a dialog box that always exists in javascript as $diabox, underwitch I need to select, at some depth, div.table, under which are a.linkIwant, at some depth. I can't think of a way to do it without being able to specify descendants in the selector itself.
[15:34:19] <BinaryKitten> or $('commonAncestorSelector').delegate('div.base a.linkIwant', blah, blah)
[15:34:33] <karlsberg87> rook thanks you
[15:34:55] <karlsberg87> im confused WHY JQM dont use all the fonts sizes in EMS, for easy scale from user page
[15:35:03] <BinaryKitten> DrkShadow you can skip desecendants
[15:35:26] <BinaryKitten> eg 'parent 3rdlevelDescendant['
[15:35:34] <karlsberg87> this jsfiddle is awesome :P
[15:35:35] <BinaryKitten> eg 'parent 3rdlevelDescendant' even as a selector
[15:35:54] <DrkShadow> binarykitten: huh.. last I tried that it selected only children..
[15:35:59] <rook> karls: I don't know - perhaps for accessibility?
[15:36:10] <BinaryKitten> DrkShadow AH
[15:36:20] <BinaryKitten> you want div.base AND the link?
[15:36:35] <DrkShadow> no, I only want the link, but I only want such links under div.base
[15:36:41] <BinaryKitten> right
[15:36:48] <BinaryKitten> so urm what is the issue?
[15:36:56] <DrkShadow> and the link won't be a child of div.base, but a descendant.
[15:36:59] <DrkShadow> testing..
[15:37:18] <BinaryKitten> right so use the direct child selector
[15:37:35] <DrkShadow> huh.. works.
[15:37:41] <DrkShadow> ehm.. they're not children of the element.
[15:37:43] <DrkShadow> anyway.
[15:38:04] <BinaryKitten> ?
[15:38:16] * BinaryKitten is more confused now
[15:38:17] <rook> Karls: have you tried .iu-mobile {font-size:60%} as your initial selector ?
[15:38:23] <karlsberg87> rook for accesibility that i cant change the font size? what accesibility?
[15:38:38] <rook> as it is your primary CSS parent
[15:38:41] <karlsberg87> for accesibility this MUST can change it
[15:39:21] <karlsberg87> in .ui-mobile i try use ems  go try now
[15:39:26] <karlsberg87> in fiddle
[15:39:39] <BinaryKitten> karlsberg87 em's are ok
[15:39:58] <BinaryKitten> but most people don't understand the difference between them all
[15:40:34] <karlsberg87> BinaryKitten, rook http://jsfiddle.net/EZrS5/6/
[15:40:44] <karlsberg87> .iu-mobile {font-size:520%}
[15:40:50] <karlsberg87> arf IU
[15:41:41] <karlsberg87> http://jsfiddle.net/EZrS5/9/
[15:42:03] <karlsberg87> BinaryKitten: rook only change my custom text, not the header,
[15:42:37] <karlsberg87> rook: you test ".ui-mobile {font-size:50%}" and work ?
[15:42:44] <chovy> is it possible to search up the dom tree but stop at say five levels up?
[15:43:29] <BinaryKitten> karlsberg87 please no longer highlight me.
[15:43:34] * BinaryKitten is off to bed
[15:43:41] <karlsberg87> ;(
[15:43:45] <catcher> Anyone have any tips on getting hrefs that are dynamically generated by php?
[15:43:47] <coldhead> goodnight BinaryKitten!
[15:43:54] <karlsberg87> good night
[15:44:16] <yedimind> getting hrefs that are dynamically generated by php ?
[15:44:17] <rook> sokay, I will help as I can, but I need to part soon, need to go buy a blouse for a funeral tomorrow
[15:44:21] <yedimind> what are you talking abot
[15:44:25] <catcher> coldhead, I got the find() working, but still keeps returning the first of them
[15:44:50] <karlsberg87> rook: ops,
[15:44:52] <rook> karl, there is a nice add on for firefox, do you have it? web devloper?
[15:45:08] <rook> ignore my typing, trying to hurry here
[15:45:11] <coldhead> context, catcher !
[15:45:25] <catcher> haha, sorryh
[15:45:47] <karlsberg87> yes i use the inspector, and now the unique solution is rewrite one to one each UI type. .ui-title .ui-button-text, .ui-header
[15:45:55] <rook> it allows you to see the attributes and ancestors that are influencing the css of a particular element
[15:46:03] <karlsberg87> and a LOT of more class
[15:46:19] <karlsberg87> i see that are using PX units
[15:46:20] <rook> yes!, it is such a pain, but sadly that is how I start
[15:46:23] <karlsberg87> and PX not relative to parent
[15:46:51] <catcher> coldhead, yedimind:  http://jsfiddle.net/39Gt5/7/
[15:47:34] <catcher> my click handler's location value always ends up grabbing the href from the first link in the list.
[15:47:45] <rook> I'm sorry I could not be of much help
[15:48:17] <coldhead> catcher: that's because $('.textForTooltip') probably matches many elements
[15:48:26] <coldhead> and the attr() bit is hitting the first one
[15:48:28] <rook> but I would like to see your finished work if you will memo me
[15:48:36] <coldhead> you need to use the specific one that has been clicked
[15:48:42] <catcher> coldhead, that sounds exactly right to me.
[15:48:44] <coldhead> which is why you use this
[15:48:44] <rook> be happy all.
[15:48:49] <coldhead> thanks rook
[15:48:55] <coldhead> right back atcha
[15:49:12] <yedimind> catcher, http://jsfiddle.net/39Gt5/8/
[15:50:34] <iatkotep> Can anyone think of a way I can have jQuery to fade in/out my submenus on hover, but still have my hover styles in the stylesheet as a backup?
[15:50:46] <iatkotep> currently, the stylesheet overrides query.
[15:50:53] <catcher> yedimind, that's coming back 'undefined', but the approach is making sense..
[15:50:56] <iatkotep> query, that is
[15:51:04] <iatkotep> argh, autocorrect!!!
[15:51:07] <iatkotep> jquery
[15:51:28] <yedimind> iatkotep, <body class="nojs"> $(document).ready(function() { $('body').removeClass('nojs') }); .nojs ul li:hover { ... }
[15:51:38] <iatkotep> oh, right!  Im' using modernizr
[15:51:44] <iatkotep> r
[15:51:49] <iatkotep> perfect!
[15:51:50] <iatkotep> thanks
[15:52:02] <yedimind> if youre using html5boilerplate, the nojs part is already taken care of for you
[15:52:04] <yedimind> you just have to define the css
[15:52:48] <yedimind> catcher, that assumes that .tooltip wraps your whole html
[15:53:39] <catcher> yedimind, hmm, the .tooltip class is generated by the jquery plugin I'm using (http://flowplayer.org/tools/tooltip/index.html)
[15:53:50] <karlsberg87> Someone use Jquery Mobile on real phones?
[15:53:57] <yedimind> as opposed to fake phones ?
[15:54:04] <iatkotep> yep, yedimind, I'm using boilerplate.  derp moment for me :-)
[15:54:13] <localhost3000> what does '--' before a variable do? e.g. var = foo; if (--foo.bar == 0) ...
[15:54:49] <catcher> localhost3000, decrements the value by 1 before comparison?
[15:55:23] <localhost3000> catcher: ah of course. thank you
[15:55:29] <catcher> localhost3000, np!
[15:56:07] <karlsberg87> yedimind: as opposed to JQM on pc screns
[15:56:19] <karlsberg87> i ask this because the density differences
[15:56:37] <catcher> yedimind, do I need to use a different class, or change something about that .tooltip class?
[15:56:47] <yedimind> i dont understand where the .tooltip class goes
[15:56:57] <yedimind> is it around the whole div you have in your jsfiddle?
[15:57:12] <elena23> hey
[15:58:53] <catcher> yedimind, the plugin uses it to style the tooltip - the css class itself is in a stylesheet that is included in my web app.
[15:59:12] <yedimind> right but where in the DOM is it in relation to the html you have
[15:59:56] <catcher> I believe it gets included directly after the top jquery function (applied by the tooltip() function itself)
[15:59:59] <yedimind> is it a div around your div, is it somewhere else entirely
[15:59:59] <yedimind> or what
[15:59:59] <yedimind> you need to build a relationship between your tooltip and the text itself somehow
[16:00:01] <yedimind> dude
[16:00:06] <yedimind> what HTML ELEMENT is it applied to.
[16:00:21] <yedimind> where is class="tooltip"
[16:01:48] <catcher> It's somewhere else entirely, not included in my html at all. I'm guessing it doesn't get applied by anything except the jquery plug.
[16:02:05] <catcher> At no point do I call class="tooltip" exlicitly.
[16:02:11] <catcher> explicitly :-P
[16:03:48] <Genui> I got a bind event on a anchor element that doesnt work when clicking on the icon within the button... how can I fix this? Does it have to do with eventbubbling or should i include the icon in the selector somehow ?
[16:06:10] <catcher> yedimind, when I inspect the tooltip element that pops up, its class is indeed '.tooltip'
[16:07:52] <catcher> coldhead, what were you going to say earlier?
[16:12:41] <lduros> I know using regex is bad to manipulate HTML, but I'm just trying to test something quickly, and I'm trying to match nongreedy multiline between <script.*?> and script </script>. this could run on several lines, and what I have currently is: /(<script[^>]*?><\/script>)/gim
[16:12:49] <lduros> javascript doesn't have the dotall
[16:13:14] <lduros> any idea how I could make this work multiline? Currently it only matches when <script> and </script> are on the same line
[16:15:24] <Peppr_> Question: is there an effective cross-browser way to have a static json file of data on a remote server not trigger the SOP in browsers, when called in by another script in jQuery?
[16:28:31] <karlsberg87> lduros: What?
[16:28:51] <karlsberg87> only work on one line? o_O
[16:31:44] <lduros> karlsberg87: yeh
[16:32:19] <lduros> karlsberg87: this /(<script[^>]*?>[\s\S].*<\/script>)/gim will only match <script...>....</script> on a single line, not two lines
[16:32:33] <lduros> although the multiline flag is there
[16:32:52] <karlsberg87> <script> in multiline is totally correct
[16:33:09] <lduros> ?
[16:33:17] <lduros> sorry:  /(<script[^>]*?>.*<\/script>)/gim
[16:33:22] <lduros> this is my regexp
[16:33:36] <karlsberg87> i understand that you cannot run your regexp using <script> tag in multiline?
[16:33:38] <lduros> I want it to match an unlimited number of lines in the middle
[16:33:43] <karlsberg87> ams
[16:33:47] <lduros> right
[16:33:53] <karlsberg87> but not a jquery related question
[16:33:53] <Eviltwin> Don't you want an s in there?
[16:34:09] <karlsberg87> regexp syntax
[16:34:18] <lduros> this will match: <script ..> var a = 0; </script> but not <script> line 1;
[16:34:18] <lduros> line2</script>
[16:34:23] <lduros> no it's not jquery related
[16:34:31] <lduros> but anyway, jquery is javascript
[16:34:52] <karlsberg87> im not good using regexp, the uniques chances that i need write this i use a book in frontof
[16:35:02] <karlsberg87> you try in #javascript ?
[16:35:06] <lduros> ok
[16:35:16] <lduros> no, i'll try
[16:35:18] <lduros> thanks
[16:46:07] <coldhead> catcher: which is why you use `this`
[16:46:13] <coldhead> that was the entire thing
[16:46:26] <Whirl3d> coldhead! Good evenin'
[16:46:48] <catcher> Ah, gotcha. My $(this) refers to a different element, but I have an idea - shall return with results :)
[16:49:59] <abjorn> sup coldhead, imsky, and all the other cool people
[16:50:06] <abjorn> to all you non-cool people: I'm not saying hi to you

[16:55:27] <Peppr_> Question: is there an effective cross-browser way to have a static json file of data on a remote server not trigger the SOP in browsers, when called in by another script in jQuery?
[16:55:43] <erichynds> Peppr_: JSONP
[16:55:43] <yedimind> abjorn, get it done or pay someone to do it, dont let it build up
[16:55:51] <yedimind> cuz you run out of time
[16:55:52] <yedimind>  :)
[16:56:33] <abjorn> well
[16:56:35] <abjorn> I could
[16:56:36] <Peppr_> erichyunds: thanks, but JSONP uses callbacks and is dynamic in nature. I have a static file so was wondering how I could do that
[16:56:54] <erichynds> Peppr_: form it like a JSONP request? doesn't matter if it's dynamic or static
[16:56:56] <ddoom> is there a way to check if a file download dialog appears?
[16:57:01] <abjorn> Work on this site, work on my game engine project, play Path of Exile, play LoL, or play pokemon. Choices, choices.
[16:57:31] <yedimind> life is full of choices, its the decisions you make for those choices that define who you are
[16:57:51] <karlsberg87> Don caballero
[16:58:26] <Peppr_> erichyunds: Really, so by wrapping it in a function call it work? How do you tell jQuery to use a fixed callback, since more callbacks are dynamic in jQuery "callback=?".
[16:58:29] <imsky> yedimind: that's one hamfisted way to quote palahniuk
[16:58:34] <karlsberg87> thanks to god we have choices
[16:58:40] <abjorn> lol
[16:58:41] <catcher> coldhead, beginning to think what I'm trying to do isn't possible with this tooltip..
[16:58:44] <karlsberg87> if not, im still using Windows...
[16:58:45] <yedimind> i'm all about the hamfists
[16:58:47] <catcher> Any suggestions for other tooltips?
[16:58:50] <imsky> HAMBO!
[16:58:54] <abjorn> shove my fist up your ham
[16:59:12] <catcher> I need something I can overlay on an image, fading in, transparent, linkable..
[16:59:26] <yedimind> catcher, its possible, but you have a giant gap in understanding how jquery / html / dom structure works
[16:59:29] <yedimind> which is unfortunate
[16:59:37] <abjorn> imsky: you should start playing LoL so we can procrastinate together
[16:59:43] <yedimind> so, really, you're going to have to find yourself a tooltip that does exactly what you need
[16:59:44] <karlsberg87> lalilo laloleilo, lalilo, lala
[16:59:45] <yedimind> and google is your friend for that
[16:59:54] <imsky> abjorn: i don't procrastinate, i have around 5 projects going at any given time
[16:59:56] <catcher> yedimind, I'm really working towards a better understanding, and have done lots of homework/research
[16:59:58] <abjorn> or you could make a tooltop that does exactly what you need
[17:00:05] <abjorn> tooltip, even
[17:00:09] <abjorn> tip, top, same diff
[17:00:15] <yedimind> i understand, i didnt mean it as an insult, just an observation
[17:00:19] <catcher> yedimind, And I'd really like to keep trying, just running out of ideas.
[17:00:40] <catcher> yedimind, not insulted, I understand I'm pretty new to this... just at a roadblock atm.
[17:00:44] <abjorn> imsky: I'm a procrastinator, it's what I do, unfortunately.
[17:00:55] <abjorn> honestly, i should be on adhd meds
[17:01:22] <imsky> lol
[17:01:30] <yedimind> catcher, if i had more time id walk you through it but not only do i not have time, im also frustrated so i wont be all that helpful
[17:01:32] <imsky> i can't be, abjorn, self-employed
[17:01:55] <karlsberg87> Chacho, como la mangan estunis payunos, me maten que no chanelan caló
[17:01:57] <abjorn> yeah
[17:02:00] <catcher> yedimind, the last thing I tried was to actually use the .tooltip class myself in a div, and put a copy of the a href inside so I could use $(this).find("a").attr("href") to get that value..
[17:02:29] <catcher> Since otherwise the use of the .tooltip class doesn't appear in the code with the way this tooltip works
[17:02:35] <imsky> abjorn: i do play portal 2 though, coop wit me brah
[17:02:48] <catcher> I hear you though, unless you can share any other quick leads.
[17:02:53] <abjorn> i never did play that portal 2 coop
[17:03:00] <imsky> it's fun as shit
[17:03:05] <abjorn> i bet
[17:03:13] <Peppr_> erichynds: any thoughts?
[17:03:18] <imsky> abjorn: you play spiral knights?
[17:03:34] <abjorn> no
[17:03:50] <imsky> daaaaamn
[17:04:14] <erichynds> Peppr_: try using $.getScript() instead of $.getJSON()
[17:05:08] <yedimind> tf2 > portal for multiplayer
[17:05:16] <yedimind> imo
[17:06:07] <Peppr_> erichynds: would the executing function be in the remote js? not sure how I would make that work that would not trigger the SOP.
[17:06:35] <erichynds> Peppr_: JSONP is not an XHR request, and thus no SOP limitation
[17:07:37] <erichynds> Peppr_: it basically sets the src of a new script tag and executes it
[17:08:35] <imsky> yedimind: i play tf2 as well, they are 2 totally different games
[17:08:45] <coldhead> catcher: your tooltipper might be shit
[17:09:08] <coldhead> catcher: you might be able to exploit :visible
[17:09:13] <yedimind> they are, im just saying tf2 is more fun multiplater wise
[17:09:15] <Peppr_> erichynds: ahh, let me give that a try. thanks.
[17:09:23] <coldhead> $('.tooltip:visible a').attr('href')
[17:09:36] <imsky> yedimind: one's a shooter, the other's a puzzle... if you like shooters, you'll like tf2
[17:09:56] <coldhead> catcher: with the tooltip open try different selectors at the firebug/inspector console
[17:10:07] <coldhead> to see what actually works
[17:10:14] <catcher> coldhead, I'm wondering about that... or maybe even overlaying an additional div that can be a link
[17:11:00] <coldhead> sounds like more trouble than switching to another tooltipper
[17:11:05] <coldhead> i like tiptip lately
[17:11:13] <coldhead> although qtip has the best name
[17:11:29] <catcher> haha
[17:11:37] <Kamakazi> I use qtip
[17:11:46] <Kamakazi> maybe a little bit because of the name
[17:11:52] <catcher> well I appreciate the help very much.. I'll look into those and see if I can get them doing what I need them to do.
[17:12:04] <imsky> tipsy ftw
[17:12:19] <coldhead> that's also a good name
[17:12:39] <Duffleman> Howdy people, can I grab a hand with .change() please?
[17:13:25] <Duffleman> I'm using .change() to monitor form elements, and .append() to add new form elements, but .change() doesn't work on the newly appended form elements.
[17:13:39] <catcher> coldhead, does tiptip use an image?
[17:13:59] <eddiemonge> ?delegate @ Duffleman
[17:14:00] <bot-t> Duffleman, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[17:14:01] <erichynds> Duffleman: delegate()
[17:14:47] <Duffleman> Ahh thanks erichynds :D
[17:14:58] * erichynds steals all the credit
[17:15:11] <Duffleman> And eddiemonge :P
[17:15:22] <Duffleman> Oh and bot-t
[17:15:25] <Duffleman> :)
[17:16:35] <eddiemonge> erichynds: jerk lol.
[17:17:27] <catcher> coldhead, nm, seeing a webkit construction in the css
[17:17:28] <Duffleman> So can I use: $('input[name*="startTime"]').delegate(function() { ... });
[17:18:48] <eddiemonge> Duffleman: read the docs for usage
[17:19:05] <Duffleman> Okay, its just a little ambigious. Thanks everyone!
[17:19:43] <eddiemonge> $('form').delegate('input[name*="startTime"]', 'change', function() { ... });
[17:45:11] <abjorn> So I ran into the weirdest issue at work today, imsky
[17:45:21] <imsky> what's up
[17:45:26] <abjorn> I got a "sir plz my site is slow" for the millionth time
[17:45:38] <imsky> plz sir fix my websights ill pay you in sneakers
[17:45:55] <nathanw_> hey
[17:46:03] <abjorn> usually it's either because there's a shit ton of external resources or theres a server issue
[17:46:07] <abjorn> but this time
[17:46:09] <abjorn> it was neither
[17:46:16] <abjorn> and so I ran YSlow
[17:46:24] <abjorn> and YSlow was like "wut? lol A+ rating"
[17:46:32] <imsky> you got trolld
[17:46:43] <abjorn> so then I used the timeline in Chrome Dev Tools
[17:46:59] <abjorn> and I found the most bizarre thing
[17:47:06] <abjorn> there was huge gaps where nothing was happening
[17:47:11] <abjorn> like 30-40 second gaps
[17:47:21] <nathanw_> question, how do I get the .val of an input and render it as a <span>
[17:47:32] <abjorn> it wasn't loading anything, there wasn't any connection pending
[17:47:36] <imsky> abjorn: settimeout baby
[17:47:40] <abjorn> it was just huge gaps of nothing happening
[17:47:46] <abjorn> no this was in the middle of loading
[17:47:59] <abjorn> of loading the page
[17:47:59] <imsky> :o
[17:48:05] <abjorn> it'd be like
[17:48:12] <abjorn> paint operation
[17:48:14] <abjorn> less than 0ms
[17:48:16] <abjorn> then
[17:48:18] <abjorn> huge 40 second gap
[17:48:22] <abjorn> then fetch stylesheet.css
[17:48:33] <imsky> lolwut
[17:48:41] <abjorn> I showed like 10 people at work they were all like
[17:48:42] <abjorn> "wtf"
[17:50:24] <imsky> so wat happend
[17:50:28] <abjorn> dunno
[17:50:31] <abjorn> ended up making a ticket
[17:50:35] <imsky> lol
[17:50:59] <abjorn> like "yeah just make a ticket and someone will figure it out"
[17:51:01] <imsky> you shoulda ab'd that sunofabitch
[17:51:16] <abjorn> nah i cant do that
[17:51:35] <abjorn> had to keep working on chats n shit, cant just take an hour or two to solve that one
[17:52:15] <imsky> damn...some xfiles shit
[17:52:34] <abjorn> yeah im in like
[17:52:37] <abjorn> 3 chats at a time
[17:54:29] <coldhead> which is the best?
[17:54:36] <coldhead> #alwaysteenchristiansandmidi?
[17:54:51] <abjorn> ?
[17:55:34] <coldhead> that's always been my favourite
[17:55:39] <coldhead> but i am banned now
[17:55:46] <coldhead> for saying jesus didn't love midi
[17:55:51] <abjorn> lol
[17:56:33] <imsky> jesus loved the good stuff
[17:57:21] <nathanw_> coldhead: aha who said he didn't
[17:57:38] <nathanw_> *says
[17:57:41] <coldhead> there's no biblical evidence is all i'm saying
[17:57:49] <nathanw_> lol
[17:57:50] <abjorn> rofl
[17:57:55] <nathanw_> what a waste of time even arguing about
[17:58:17] <coldhead> meh, like there's anything better to do with time
[17:58:55] <nathanw_> some christians argue about the stupidest things lol
[17:59:13] <coldhead> at least it keeps them off the streets
[18:01:37] <nathanw_> lol what's that supposed to mean
[18:01:52] <nathanw_> but I guess people in general argue about stupid things, christians are no different
[18:01:53] <abjorn> idonteven
[18:02:19] <abjorn> imsky: In the end I think it may have been a bug with an older version of the dev tools
[18:02:27] <nathanw_> 'in general'
[18:02:31] <imsky> holy lawd, abjorn
[18:02:40] <abjorn> well that's the only thing that makes sense to me
[18:02:50] <ddoom> I have an ajax call that sets a cookie via php, anyone know why I wouldn't be able to read that cookie in javascript after the ajax call ends, in IE? (works in FF)
[18:02:56] <abjorn> a bug where something was happening on the browser end, the dev tools just didn't report it correctly
[18:03:35] <nathanw_> $(this).closest("li").find("input.qty").val()     <---- how do i wrap the value in <span> </span> ?
[18:04:17] <nathanw_> anyone ?
[18:04:25] <yogurt_truck> ask jesus
[18:04:37] <abjorn> append it to a new <span></span> then add that to the dom?
[18:04:59] <nathanw_> hmmm
[18:05:38] <imsky> reach out and touch faith
[18:05:48] <catcher> Any recommendations for the best tool for an overlay that displays new info, and then click to follow a link?
[18:06:26] <imsky> w0at
[18:06:42] <nathanw_> good preaching.
[18:07:02] <yogurt_truck> catcher: there's jquery ui's dialog, if you're into that sort of thing
[18:07:06] <nathanw_> ah i think this will work
[18:09:44] <yogurt_truck> i wish i could clone coyotes
[18:10:16] <yogurt_truck> oops wrong channel
[18:10:32] <imsky> i wish i could clone yogurt trucks
[18:10:36] <imsky> i just topped you
[18:10:38] <imsky> son
[18:10:46] <nathanw_> $(this).closest("li").find("input.qty").val().append( $("strong") )
[18:10:55] <imsky> oh man appending to a val

[18:11:25] <imsky> i have yet to see new ones
[18:11:29] <abjorn> this isnt a new one
[18:11:52] <imsky> nathanw_: why are you appending all the strong tags to a value of an input?
[18:12:46] <nathanw_> imsky: probably because I have very clue what i'm doing! :p
[18:12:50] <kborchers> wait ... imsky ... was that a depeche mode reference?
[18:13:00] <imsky> kborchers: yes, i'm surprised nobody got it
[18:13:07] <imsky> yer owwnnnn peeersonal jesus
[18:13:10] <nathanw_> imsky: i just want the value of the input to be <span>value</span> instead of just the value
[18:13:17] <yogurt_truck> i got it
[18:13:22] <imsky> yogurt_truck: hipster
[18:13:26] <yogurt_truck> i know
[18:13:55] <imsky> nathanw_: you'd have to do an .each anyway, and in the each, add the span's .text()

[18:21:20] <bencahill> nathanw_: a jquery problem, that is

[19:24:28] <bennos> Does jQuery have proper support for :invalid and :valid selectors for HTML5 forms?? It seems to, but its not in the KB
[19:26:51] <bennos> http://jsfiddle.net/mbCbt/ this works in Firefox 7, but chrome and safari both have issues with the jQuery of determining if its invalid (it validates the preceding selection) anyone know?
[19:29:46] <miketaylr> bennos: no
[19:30:40] <ReAn> is there a way to get an element's width/height in one pass? I'm worried on bad browsers it'll cause 2 reflows
[19:30:58] <ReAn> or will it not cause 2 reflows, one for the .width() and one for the .height()
[19:31:22] <ch3mi0n> ReAn: why would getting cause a reflow?
[19:31:56] <ReAn> I know 100% for a fact .height() can cause a reflow if the browser is uncertain if it's last dimensions are accurate
[19:32:11] <ReAn> it reflows the document to get accurate dimensions
[19:32:13] <miketaylr> that probably depends on the browser
[19:32:16] <ReAn> i know
[19:32:23] <ReAn> so im optimizing for the worst case
[19:32:43] <ReAn> i was hoping i could get them back in one pass like .offset() or .position()
[19:33:00] <miketaylr> there's nothing in jQuery for that, AFAIK
[19:33:14] <ReAn> :/
[19:33:22] <ReAn> shucks :/
[19:33:31] <miketaylr> just let it reflowwwwwww
[19:33:45] <miketaylr> then delete a .jpg and you're all good
[19:33:53] <ReAn> ???
[19:33:58] <miketaylr> :D
[19:39:29] <bencahill> anyone willing to look at a page for me? autocomplete works until the page has finished loading, it's quite bizarre
[19:40:00] <ch3mi0n> bencahill: you should probably wait until DOM ready to initialize autocomplete
[19:40:38] <bencahill> ch3mi0n: I have it wrapped in a jQuery(document).ready(function() { block
[19:41:42] <ch3mi0n> bencahill: then I'm guessing something is changing part of your DOM that has to do with your autocomplete box, so you probably need to init it after something else. What's the link?
[19:42:03] <bencahill> ch3mi0n: well, it needs a password, is it fine if I /msg you?
[19:42:06] <ch3mi0n> bencahill: p.s. just use jQuery(function($) { });
[19:42:09] <ch3mi0n> ;)
[19:42:13] <ch3mi0n> Sure thing, go ahead
[19:42:16] <bencahill> ok

[20:11:37] <klafka> if i want to delete a table from a div with id='foo' would i do $('#foo').removeAttr('table') ?
[20:12:19] <kborchers> klafka: $("#foo").find("table
[20:12:23] <kborchers> oops
[20:12:31] <kborchers> $("#foo").find("table").remove();
[20:12:36] <klafka> awesome, thanks
[20:12:41] <diggan> I currently have this code "var topThreadOld = $('#threadslist tbody tr').next().html();" and topThreadOld is having some html in it. But, now I want that var and another var with a div from topThreadOld. I tried to use jQuery selectors on the variable but no success there... Could someone here help me with this?
[20:12:46] <kborchers> that will remove all tables in that div
[20:12:54] <klafka> that's cool
[20:13:18] <klafka> if i wanted it to remove a table with id='bar'?
[20:13:37] <kborchers> just do $("bar").remove() since id's are unique
[20:13:40] <klafka> aaaah
[20:13:42] <klafka> ok sweet
[20:13:47] <kborchers> sorry #bar
[20:14:03] <kborchers> klafka: ^^
[20:14:27] <klafka> gotcha thanks
[20:16:39] <diggan> anyone?
[20:18:36] <kborchers> diggan: if i understand you, you should be able to do $(topThreadOld).someJQMethod...
[20:19:31] <kborchers> so like var theDiv = $(topThreadOld).find("#yourDivID");
[20:21:17] <diggan> I don't that it's that simple
[20:21:18] <diggan> 		 		var topThreadOld = $('#threadslist tbody tr').next().html();
[20:21:19] <diggan> 				var topThreadOldName = $(topThreadOld).html();
[20:21:32] <diggan> got that 2 lines, but they output different html
[20:21:46] <diggan> when it should be the same
[20:22:03] <kborchers> not necessarily
[20:22:18] <diggan> html grabs the inner html...
[20:22:42] <kborchers> topThreadOld will have the top level tr in the html, but when you say $(topThreadOld).html(); it will get the innerHTML of that tr
[20:24:14] <diggan> but how can I make it html without getting the innerHTML?
[20:26:24] <kborchers> why would you do that? you already have that html in topThreadOld
[20:27:02] <diggan> I got some html in topThreadOld but I want a single td of topThreadOld to appear in topThreadOldName
[20:28:04] <kborchers> ok, so you have to select that td from $(topThreadOld) and then do .html()
[20:28:39] <diggan> but I can't select it because it don't appear when I do $(topThreadOld).html()
[20:30:38] <diggan> kborchers, look at this: http://pastebin.com/6sJbt6iE
[20:30:50] <diggan> that's what I get from
[20:30:50] <diggan> 		 		var topThreadOld = $('#threadslist tbody tr').next().html();
[20:30:50] <diggan> 				var topThreadOldName = $(topThreadOld).html();
[20:32:03] <diggan> I trying to select this: "Är jag med i kyrkan?"
[20:32:26] <kborchers> ahhh, because the tr isn't there so it is giving you the html of the first td in the collection ... which td are you trying to grab?
[20:34:09] <diggan> kborchers, I'm trying to grab the content of the a (link)
[20:34:23] <Abbas-> guys, my form validates just fine with jquery but now i want it to validate only when a certain input field's value is "<span>email available</span>" or "<span>profile url availabale</span>"
[20:34:36] <Abbas-> how do i plug in this check into my validation code?
[20:35:12] <Abbas-> i did a separate javascript only function that checks that input field and can stop form from submitting but since there's jquery validation also beign performed on that form so jquery itself submits the form even if my js-only function stops the form
[20:35:15] <kborchers> diggan: what does $(topThreadOld).find("#thread_title_1689471").html() give u?
[20:36:04] <diggan> kborchers, nothing
[20:37:20] <m0nkfish> in a statement such as $('.hide).slideUp('slow', callback), is the callback executed once for every selected element?
[20:38:16] <kborchers> diggan: ok, change topThreadOld to  var topThreadOld = $('#threadslist tbody tr').next();
[20:38:36] <kborchers> then do topThreadOld.find("#thread_title_1689471").html();
[20:40:11] <diggan> kborchers, works great! But, the #thread_title always change, how can I adjust the code so it works with other #thread_title?
[20:42:50] <kborchers> assuming the rows are always structured the same you could do topThreadOld.children().eq(1).children().eq(0).html();  wow, that's ugly and there may be a better way but that should work
[20:44:02] <diggan> works perfectly :D Thanks alot for your help kborchers
[20:44:08] <kborchers> np
[20:50:45] <m0nkfish> how can i synchronise jquery animations
[20:52:23] <nicksergeant> m0nkfish: could you clarify? Show us your problem: http://jsfiddle.net
[20:52:35] <kborchers> m0nkfish: if you set the queue option to false, the animations will run together
[21:07:54] <diggan> now I'm trying to add this content I have with $('#threadslist tbody tr:first').after(topThreadNewTags); and it works fine. I'm trying to add slideDown() before .after(topThreadNewTags) but it doesn't work. Any solution to this?
[21:10:51] <diggan> I have to save that one for later, laptop battery running out of power
[21:33:03] <Abbas_> can someone please point out why my jquery call fails from withing my custom javascript function? (the custom function does some checks before the jquery validation is called upon, or atleast that's how i intend it to work. a newbie here) . http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=t3WXdfeS
[21:33:35] <Abbas_> the custom function innards work , just the jquery function call doesn't do anything. and i guess i'm doing the call wrong
[21:47:20] <CrazyTux[m]> Hello, I am using buttonset() on a group of checkboxes - I want to retrieve the values of those checked checkboxes... but upon further investigation it does not appear that .buttonset() actually updates these checkboxes with "checked" state?
[21:47:40] <CrazyTux[m]> Any ideas / work arounds on how I can get the values of the checked buttons / checkboxes.

[22:08:00] <coldhead> people are, yes, aaroninfidel
[22:10:07] <roboman> I'm trying to pull the 'location' out of some headers sent by Ajax, but .getAllResponseHeaders() seems to return a string.
[22:10:25] <roboman> Is this correct?  Shouldn't it be an array or JSON returned so I can look it up?
[22:11:24] <roboman> another way to ask: how can I pull a specific element out of the headers?
[22:12:11] <coldhead> parse it yourself?
[22:12:20] <aaroninfidel> coldhead: what've you done with it?
[22:12:46] <aaroninfidel> coldhead: I want to make games with it, but I have no knowledge of game programming.

[22:27:47] <aaroninfidel> dove`: http://www.gmarwaha.com/blog/2007/08/23/lavalamp-for-jquery-lovers/
[22:28:22] <dove`> thanks aaroninfidel
[22:28:26] <aaroninfidel> dove`: yep :)
[22:30:07] <coldhead> DickAss was making some valid points
[23:05:28] <samrat> could anyone see why this http://jsfiddle.net/CAs9b/2/ isn't sending an XmlHttpRequest
[23:06:09] <coldhead> are you trying to access something on another domain?
[23:06:52] <samrat> coldhead- yes,
[23:07:07] <samrat> coldhead- which is why I'm using callback
[23:07:17] <samrat> that should work right?
[23:08:47] <coldhead> samrat: i always use JSONP and let jQuery handle it
[23:09:10] <samrat> coldhead- how can I do that?
[23:09:47] <coldhead> search here for jsonp: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[23:09:50] <samrat> you mean pass JSONP from my server? the youtube API is passing JSON
[23:11:50] <coldhead> ?getJSON @ samrat
[23:11:50] <bot-t> samrat, jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [success]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[23:11:59] <coldhead> that supports jsonp and looks even simpler
[23:12:45] <samrat> coldhead- I am using getJSON
[23:13:23] <samrat> and since there is "callback=", it gets JSONP.
[23:13:27] <coldhead> you are also doing new XHR()
[23:13:36] <coldhead> which isn't how JSONP works
[23:14:24] <samrat> so, I remove the XMR()?
[23:14:29] <samrat> XHR
[23:15:48] <coldhead> samrat: is videodropper.ep.io your domain?
[23:15:55] <samrat> coldhead- yes
[23:16:05] <coldhead> ah so that AJAX is okay
[23:16:21] <coldhead> i still don't see why you are using new XMLHttpRequest();
[23:16:26] <coldhead> and all this readystatechange stuff
[23:16:45] <coldhead> can't you just use jQuery .ajax() in your getJSON callback?
[23:16:59] <samrat> coldhead- getJSON gets data from the youtube API
[23:17:13] <coldhead> yes
[23:17:20] <coldhead> and then you do something else with it
[23:17:23] <coldhead> with another server
[23:17:26] <samrat> coldhead- then I'm using XHR to send a GET request to my server
[23:17:39] <coldhead> i understand that
[23:17:45] <coldhead> i just don't know why you're using XHR
[23:17:49] <coldhead> instead of jQuery ajax()
[23:17:51] <coldhead> for the second step
[23:18:05] <samrat> coldhead- oh, okay
[23:18:11] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery sorry samrat
[23:18:21] <coldhead> but already i prefer ajax() to native XHR
[23:19:01] <samrat> coldhead- i'm quite new to JS and jquery too, so its giving me a headache
[23:19:18] <coldhead> ajax() should  be simpler
[23:19:26] <coldhead> or even use ?post
[23:19:27] <bot-t> jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[23:19:42] <coldhead> and avoid specifying the entire domain name
[23:19:48] <dove`> jQuery is really cool
[23:20:04] <coldhead> because ajax won't work if the host and the target are slightly different
[23:20:17] <paul_irish> dove`++
[23:20:40] <dove`> same things can be pretty hard with javascript, but jQuery makes them so simple
[23:20:47] <dove`> paul_irish :)
[23:20:59] <coldhead> well said, dove`
[23:21:06] <coldhead> that's why i'm going to keep using it
[23:21:38] <dove`> lol
[23:21:56] <dove`> i know, this is your first day using jQuery right :p
[23:22:15] <coldhead> yes
[23:22:20] <coldhead> but i am going to use it more tomorrow!
[23:22:33] <coldhead> and maybe the day after
[23:22:35] <dove`> sure, you can
[23:22:39] <dove`> i allow you
[23:22:42] <dove`> to do so
[23:22:42] <coldhead> if jQuery hasn't solved all my problems already
[23:22:52] <coldhead> i am so sweaty
[23:24:39] <Rich_Morin> How should I test for the user clicking in an <input type="text" ...>  field and conversely, clicking away from it?
[23:25:02] <paul_irish> focus and blur
[23:25:03] <Rich_Morin> I've tried "click" but that doesn't seem to fire.
[23:25:17] <Rich_Morin> tnx; I'll look them up
[23:26:41] <samrat> coldhead- is just $.ajax(send_url) enough?
[23:27:29] <coldhead> it is enough if the URL has the data you want to send
[23:27:34] <coldhead> and you don't care about the result!
[23:27:43] <samrat> coldhead- how do i get the result?
[23:28:04] <coldhead> provide a callback function (data) { USE_DATA_HERE() {
[23:28:09] <coldhead> }*
[23:28:23] <coldhead> have a look at the ajax docs, it demonstrates it better than i ever could
[23:29:25] <samrat> coldhead- just to make sure its $.ajax(send_url, function(){....       right?
[23:29:42] <coldhead> that looks good to me!
[23:33:08] <samrat> coldhead- the server doesn't seem to get the request http://dpaste.com/637147/
[23:57:17] <coldhead> samrat: i think you need to specify dataType: 'jsonp'
[23:57:25] <coldhead> or it doesn't know that's what's happening
[23:58:36] <samrat> coldhead- thanks, that worked
[23:59:13] <coldhead> yay!
[23:59:19] <coldhead> good job samrat
[23:59:23] <coldhead> you're an inspiration
[23:59:40] <samrat> coldhead: thanks, but how does the .ajax recieve the response
