[00:53:51] <nullslash> Hi, I'm trying to select an id from html code that was genereted by handlebar, and appended to a div. Is there is a way to do that without using .on?
[01:00:19] <nullslash> :(
[02:17:15] <Uhkis> nullslash: use delegation and it works fine with .on
[02:35:09] <nullslash> I used .then and works fine
[05:58:24] <flestter> hey guys, i want to add an .on function, which creates an element, i want to perform another operation on that element that has to wait for the element to be created, so can I put another on event function inside, like nest them?
[05:58:53] <flestter> the reason is I need some creator variables in the second on event.
[05:58:59] <flestter> so i'm kind of confused how to approach
[06:05:08] <Uhkis> flestter: care to make an example on jsfiddle?
[06:07:40] <flestter> it's kind of hard, i guess one answer that would help, can i create an on statement within an on statement, so one event creates another event, and if I use the once will this limit the second on statement from being created many times
[06:08:35] <Uhkis> anyways it sounds like you just need delegation
[06:10:18] <flestter> it's really hard to explain b/c i'm not super experienced, but i need to listen to an event that creates an object, and then I need to further modify that object, but have to wait until its created before i can modify it
[06:10:52] <flestter> er, i listen for event, create object, wait for object to be created, then further modify object after created
[06:12:00] <flestter> but i need data from the object's creation for the modification, so i need a wait and a tie in.  that would be the idea behind creating another .on event
[06:12:05] <Uhkis> so you're making an ajax call?
[06:13:24] <flestter> um, its creating an image object in the fabric.js library, but some parameters i can only modify after i created the item
[06:13:55] <flestter> so i need variables from the function that creates the object, to also be used after the object is created
[06:14:11] <flestter> sorry of confusing ~
[06:15:48] <Uhkis> that fiddle would be a lot less confusing
[06:59:12] <kanzie> Im trying to write a UI for a backend but I’m getting strange behaviour when logging in. It only remebers my session if I run in incognito mode with xhrFields: withCredentials
[06:59:27] <kanzie> this however means I cant use access-control: *
[07:01:46] <kanzie> anyone ever heard of this or know where I should start
[07:42:36] <kanzie> I don’t get why the server is sending set-cookie on every request unless I add the xhrFields: withCredentials…
[09:36:30] <anurag1018> Hey, I am new to a github.I wish to contribute to jquery. How to get started?
[09:51:20] <anurag1018> Hey, I am a novice. Please guide me on how to get started on contributing to jquery projects.
[09:52:17] <snover> anurag1018: http://contribute.jquery.org/
[10:01:26] <anurag1018> snover: I have read this this doc. but I still do not understand where to get started. On the github page, I could see a list of projects.I understand that I need to fork them them but what to do next?
[10:01:59] <snover> write code?
[10:09:17] <ertl> hello guys, I found this code online http://jsfiddle.net/29T7V/1/ that does exactly what I was looking for (ie swapping input values between table rows); now I'd extend it to support moving checked='checked' attribute of checkboxes, too, but I'm a bit clueless... any hint? Thanks
[10:16:27] <sveri> Hi, I am trying to do an ajax request to my spring application. This is the jquery code: http://pastebin.com/y7Phej3P I just cannot make it return the expected code. When I make the same post, with the same data, to the same URI with postman it returns the expected data. I also debugged my application, it all looks good and the controller returns data as expected.
[10:27:11] <Uhkis> sveri: first: ditch the "JSON.stringify" and if that doesnt help, ditch the dataType
[10:27:34] <sveri> Uhkis: I tried both already, I got different errors when, so I need these two.
[10:28:52] <Uhkis> also contentType doesnt seem to match what you're sending
[10:29:34] <sveri> Uhkis: you mean application/json? Why?
[10:30:14] <sveri> Within the postman request I have the same content-type set.
[10:31:44] <Uhkis> but your data is a string?
[10:32:33] <sveri> Within Postman? I dont know exactly how postman handles it, but yea, I think so, most probably its converted.
[10:32:42] <Uhkis> i have no idea what is postman
[10:32:54] <sveri> Its a tool to test REST interfaces
[10:33:12] <sveri> Just something handy to debug requests and stuff vs a REST API
[10:33:35] <Uhkis> anyways, check your browsers network or console to check what's moving between your browser and the server
[10:37:15] <sveri> Yea, thats the tricky thing, I am doing this from a chrome extension and I just dont see the requests
[10:37:17] <sveri> only the response
[10:39:08] <Uhkis> so make a regular page with that code
[10:39:47] <sveri> well, thats a good idea :D
[10:39:55] <sveri> Thank you, I am to blind already
[10:42:33] <sveri> Ok, I got it, I had the inputs wrapped inside a form, and this somehow sent the ajax request and the form request, to, wherever. Removing the form tags solved it
[10:42:42] <sveri> Thanks for looking at it Uhkis
[11:43:35] <lu_tze> hello, anyone have time to help me with a small question?
[11:49:41] <Calinou> lu_tze: ask away
[11:49:44] <Calinou> (don't ask to ask :p)
[11:51:26] <lu_tze> Calinou: ok :) So I have a navbar that consist of div with role=button, and I'm setting the .active class on 'click', while also removing the previous .active, but when click-mark-dragging the mouse over all the links in the navbar, all links get the .active class.
[11:52:19] <lu_tze> I'm guessing it has to do with .focus, as I'm using bootstrap, but I tried to apply blur() to the link that prev had the .active class, but that didn't work
[12:02:46] <lu_tze> disregard, solved it.
[12:34:41] <Solarlux> I don understand jquery wierd syntax
[12:34:46] <Solarlux> weird
[12:34:58] <Solarlux> Anyone know simple tutorials for total dumbass?
[12:36:20] <snover> https://learn.jquery.com/
[13:21:14] <Getty> does someone know of a jquery plugin that allows me to generate bootstrap elements? It is REALLY hard to find that as jquery and bootstrap in a google search literally shows all bootstrap resources that exist, cause they all mention jquery
[15:11:02] <ircbaako> hi guys https://jsfiddle.net/baako/j97tzu7L/ to get the data-charge-id when the corresponding table row when i click on the "refund" button do i need to wrap tr in a form or is they a better way of doing it please
[15:11:06] <ircbaako> i have tried this https://jsfiddle.net/baako/j97tzu7L/1/ but cannot get the value for the data attrbute
[15:13:24] <shoky> ircbaako:  you can get attributes with .attr().  for data-x attributes specifically you can get them with .data(x) too
[15:16:26] <ircbaako> hi shoky i tried console.log(row.data("charge-id"));
[15:16:29] <ircbaako> got undefined
[15:16:48] <ircbaako> i need to get the data-charge-id for the corresponding roll
[15:16:52] <ircbaako> row*
[15:17:05] <shoky> ircbaako: row is not the element that has that attribute
[15:17:13] <shoky> you found it in your code..
[15:18:33] <ircbaako> dont understand what you mean shoky in your last statement
[15:19:07] <shoky> ircbaako: row.data("charge-id")  is wrong because `row` is the <tr> which doesn't have any data-charge-id attribute on it
[15:19:27] <shoky> you need to run .data("charge-id")  on the right element, the one that has that attribute
[15:19:42] <shoky> the one that you already found in your code that you posted
[15:21:19] <ircbaako> thanks shoky
[15:21:32] <ircbaako> much apprenticed again
[15:21:40] <shoky> np
[17:01:47] <arup_r> My blur function getting called 2 times. How can I fix this? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/VjKyvq
[18:44:17] <ircbaako> hi guys i have a one page site which some contents only gets loaded on request. My question and issue i am having is that when i do this $(document).on('click', '#partial_refund', function(){ console.log("hello"); });
[18:44:42] <ircbaako> i get "hello" TWICE but they is only 1 element with the id of partial_refund
[18:45:08] <ircbaako> why does the console log show twice?
[19:13:13] <shoky> ircbaako: maybe that click handler is added twice for some reason
[19:13:38] <ircbaako> i am trying to find out but the debugger is confusing
[19:20:58] <ircbaako> shoky, i think it might has something to do with me using bootstrap model
[19:21:20] <ircbaako> http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_modal.asp
[19:21:31] <shoky> no way for me to know
[19:25:56] <ircbaako> shoky, i managed to duplicate it
[19:25:58] <ircbaako> https://jsfiddle.net/baako/s5qsrasf/
[19:34:04] <shoky> ircbaako: listen for click on the radio, not on the label
[19:42:03] <ircbaako> shoky, thanks but why did it listen twice on the label?
[19:42:23] <shoky> ircbaako: clicking the label triggers also a click on the radio
[19:42:43] <ircbaako> i see. thanks agaib
[19:42:45] <ircbaako> again
[19:42:45] <shoky> and since the radio is a child element of the label, it causes another click event on the label itself
[19:44:15] <ircbaako> shoky, can you add a selector on an input field with a specify value
[19:44:32] <ircbaako> e.g.  <input id="partial_refund"  type="radio" name="refund_type" value="partial">
[19:44:43] <ircbaako> ignore the id
[19:44:52] <shoky> if its the default value (that was written in the initial html)  then sure
[19:44:59] <shoky> [value=partial]
[19:45:18] <shoky> e.g.  'input[value=partial]'
[19:46:49] <ircbaako> thanks shoky
[20:43:18] <Ed__> hey all, quick question if you don't mind
[20:43:36] <Ed__> why does $("#end").siblings($("#nonexistent")).css("background", "pink") work?
[20:43:50] <Ed__> where end is the id in a list of elements
[20:47:39] <Ed__> ...oh, it takes in a selector, not a jquery object
[20:48:38] <Ed__> is there a way to check if an element is a sibling?
[21:13:02] <ling2> Hi by using jquery accordion, code is like <div id="accordion"><h3> section 1</h3><div>panel content</div></div>. can i change it to <div id="accordion"><div> section 1</div><div>panel content</div></div>, by using <div> tag instead of <h3>? thanks
[21:21:12] <sillyslux> instead of $( ".selector" ).accordion({ header: "h3"});
[21:21:31] <sillyslux> try $( ".selector" ).accordion({  header: "div" });
[21:21:49] <sillyslux> or $( ".selector" ).accordion({  header: "div.section" });
[21:23:52] <ling2> sillyslux: so is that mean <h3> tag for header can be replaced any tag, such as <h1>, <span>, <a>, <div> etc
[21:26:13] <sillyslux> from the docs "Accordions support arbitrary markup, but each content panel must always be the next sibling after its associated header. See the header option for information on how to use custom markup structures."
[21:27:18] <sillyslux> you are using jquery-ui?
[21:27:28] <ling2> sillyslux: yes
[21:27:54] <ling2> sillyslux: i tried, it working. i just dont know whether this is the best practice or not.
[21:28:14] <sillyslux> why shouldn't it be?
[21:29:26] <ling2> sillyslux: the reason why i change <h3> tag to <div> tag, is becuse there is no h2 tag above those h3 tab when page has accordion panels. then accessibitiy complained there is no nested h1, h2, h3 tag in page.
[21:30:19] <sillyslux> ah ic
[21:30:31] <sillyslux> how do you check for accessibility?
[21:31:08] <ling2> sillyslux: we go through siteimprove
[21:31:43] <ling2> sillyslux: so it should be no problem to use div tag instead of h3 tag for header in accordion, right?
[21:31:59] <sillyslux> yes
[21:32:21] <sillyslux> everything you see here:  $( ".selector" ).accordion({  header: "div" }); is considered best practice
[21:32:21] <ling2> sillyslux: ok, thanks
[21:32:28] <sillyslux> hex
[21:32:30] <sillyslux> stop
[21:32:31] <sillyslux> nop
[21:32:35] <sillyslux> grr
[21:32:42] <sillyslux> http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#option-header
[21:32:53] <ling2> sillyslux: ok, thanks so much for your help
[21:32:58] <sillyslux> ^ everything you see there is considered best practice
[21:33:07] <sillyslux> damn middle click paste...
