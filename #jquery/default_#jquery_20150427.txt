[00:15:06] <erdem_> having problems selecting the last element in a <div>
[00:15:37] <erdem_> could it be that :last or :last-child has a depth param?
[00:15:58] <erdem_> i only want the last element that is a direkt child of <div>
[00:17:10] <erdem_> .find('> *:last') did the trick! is there a better way or is this okay?
[00:18:25] <Kartagis> erdem_: the only way to know is if you make a fiddle
[00:20:03] <vinex08> what about mine :)
[00:23:19] <erdem_> Kartagis:  <div><a/><b><c/></b></div> find('div :last') selects <c> and find('div > :last') selects <b>
[00:24:54] <Kartagis> erdem_: by making a fiddle I meant pasting on jsfiddle.net

[00:41:45] <DragonPunch> how do i in Jquery click a button and it puts the mouse cursor into a specific textbox
[00:42:01] <Cork> the mouse cursor??
[00:42:05] <DragonPunch> like
[00:42:06] <DragonPunch> focus
[00:42:09] <DragonPunch> idk what to call it
[00:42:10] <Cork> you can't move the mouse cursor
[00:42:19] <Uhkis> ?api focus @ DragonPunch
[00:42:19] <b-ot> DragonPunch: .focus(): Bind an event handler to the "focus" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/focus/
[00:42:26] <Cork> you can move the input focus, and position the text cursor
[00:42:30] <Cork> but not the mouse cursor
[00:42:46] <DragonPunch> so like i can click a button and i can type say in my login box?
[00:42:57] <Cork> that would be the text cursor
[00:43:02] <DragonPunch> ahhh
[00:43:06] <DragonPunch> how do i control that?
[00:43:09] <Cork> see what Uhkis linked
[00:43:18] <DragonPunch> okay, making sure. tanks.
[00:43:26] <Uhkis> tanks?! where?! :D
[00:44:15] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/55z2ej92/2/ vinex08

[00:48:11] <jac0bz1> Hello! Anyone here seen "uxpin.com"? I'm looking for a similar paid or open source jquery (or just regulary javascript) app that basicly is a WYSIWYG-editor.. Like for creating a singlepage html presentation
[01:12:14] <DragonPunch> whats the best way to add a <h1></h1> element inside a div that has contentEditable = true
[01:33:27] <VaibhavRajput> Can you guys please suggest me best plugin to stick table header and column?
[01:41:30] <dimi1947> I have 2 divs with inputs inside them...the aim was to replace the iputs with content from an array...on clicking a button-I have accomplish that-I want now to do the same thing witn an object that contains others object in it....go see ths fiddle here http://jsbin.com/qudaro/26/  ...line 35
[01:41:46] <dimi1947> submit function....click the button to see what happens
[02:04:55] <Nasp> jsfiddle is so much nicer
[02:09:37] <sk8dada> Hello guys
[02:18:59] <sk8dada> Has someone here used ken burns effect?
[02:50:01] <earational> hey
[03:13:59] <dimi1947> I am trying to iterate through an object(using for/in) and place the content into 2 divs respectiveley by utilising the html() method...but I cannot understand why only the last object element is printed after all in the browser
[03:14:07] <dimi1947> http://jsbin.com/qudaro/26/
[03:15:17] <dimi1947> click the submit button so that you can trigger the save function at line 35 to see what I am talking about
[03:15:19] <Cork> dimi1947: you have to use hasOwnProperty if you use for in
[03:15:34] <Cork> or you will loop any property on the prototype too
[03:15:40] <dimi1947> how?...where?
[03:15:40] <Cork> or better just use $.each
[03:15:59] <Cork> if(obj.hasOwnProperty(x))
[03:16:54] <Cork> js> var keys= [], o = {}; Object.property.opps = true; for(var x in o) { keys.push(x) }; print(JSON.stringify(keys));
[03:16:58] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[03:17:22] <Cork> js> var keys= [], o = {}; Object.prototype.opps = true; for(var x in o) { keys.push(x) }; print(JSON.stringify(keys));
[03:17:25] <b-ot> Cork: ["opps"]
[03:17:47] <dimi1947> can you write this code in jsbin?
[03:18:07] <Cork> no, jsbin is a mess and loses changes
[03:18:17] <dimi1947> fiddle then please
[03:18:21] <Cork> i don't waste my time with it
[03:18:29] <dimi1947> ok....
[03:18:51] <dimi1947> or give me a minute to prepare a fiddle and then to modify it
[03:26:43] <dimi1947> cork...here is the fiddle...as I said click the submit button to see what I have achieved...only the last object member is printed as already stated
[03:26:45] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/0qtmg8cc/
[03:34:29] <Cork> dimi1947: so you mean like https://jsfiddle.net/0qtmg8cc/1/ ?
[03:34:43] <Cork> (btw jsfiddle should only have the content of body in the html view)
[03:36:37] <lamppid> How i can check element is have handler or not? like this $(document).on("mousemove", function() {}); //this is have handler $(document).off("mousemove") //this is not have handler
[03:37:10] <Cork> lamppid: you can't
[03:37:26] <Cork> lamppid: there is a hack where you check what event handlers jquery has cached
[03:37:35] <Cork> but it doesn't catch event handlers jquery haven't added
[03:37:40] <Cork> and it isn't a supported api
[03:38:29] <lamppid> Thanks for information :)
[03:38:30] <Cork> lamppid: if you need to know what event handlers has been added outside of debugging, you're most likely doing something wrong
[03:38:56] <Cork> lamppid: an option is to give the event handler a namespace
[03:39:00] <Cork> and then just remove that namespace
[03:39:17] <Cork> .on('mousemove.my-special-event-namespace', func)
[03:39:30] <Cork> .off('.my-special-event-namespace')
[03:46:31] <dimi1947> cork...no...again the last object member is printed...13:00
[03:46:52] <dimi1947> cork...no again the last object member is printed..13:00
[03:47:27] <dimi1947> under Monday I want 10:00
[04:04:08] <Cork> dimi1947: sure, you replace all elements matching the class on each iteration
[04:04:29] <Cork> dimi1947: you have to have a more specific filter so you only update the correct target (ex. add the mon as a class)
[04:06:15] <Cork> dimi1947: https://jsfiddle.net/0qtmg8cc/1/
[04:06:16] <Cork> opps
[04:06:37] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/0qtmg8cc/2/
[04:19:56] <dimi1947> now....nothing is printed on the browser...did you test it?
[04:20:10] <Cork> i cleaned up the html to be able to edit it
[04:20:18] <Cork> so the js isn't loaded
[04:20:53] <Cork> (if you want them you can add them in the resources section on the left)
[04:23:07] <dimi1947> the problem with fiddle is it does not support backbone...as such I have to load it as an external resource
[04:24:43] <Cork> dimi1947: sure, and you can do that in "External Resources"
[04:29:56] <dimi1947> I will get back after testing it...
[04:56:55] <Kartagis> <input class="btn success" type="button" onclick="this.blur(); window.location=&quot;index.php?do=catalog/payment&amp;lang=tr&amp;id=abfnry48-fu35-jtuy-puvz-achinqtuvwy5&amp;externalId=&quot;;" value="Satın Al"> <--- how do I achieve the window.location part with jquery? I'm adding the button wşth jq too
[04:58:14] <Kartagis> btn.addEventListener('click', function() { ...; } I assume
[04:58:58] <slax0r> $(".success").on("click", functio() { } );
[04:59:01] <slax0r> function*
[04:59:15] <Kartagis> why blur a button on click? what's the point?
[04:59:21] <Kartagis> to lose focus?
[05:00:33] <dimi1947> cork....go see the fiddle:https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/0qtmg8cc/ still it is not what I want.. the second object member is not printed under Tuesday
[05:01:31] <slax0r> if you are adding the button with jquery, you either have to defien the click handler after the button has been created, delegate it
[05:01:46] <slax0r> as in, .on("click", "selector of some parent element", function() { } )
[05:01:49] <Cork> dimi1947: ya, wednesday isn't printed under tuesday :)
[05:01:53] <slax0r> not sure if "delegate" is the right word
[05:02:26] <dimi1947> no...I want 13:00 printed under tuesday...that is the goal here
[05:02:41] <Cork> dimi1947: so you want "wed" so show under tue?
[05:02:47] <Cork> that sounds kinda... weird
[05:03:06] <Cork> but sure, just change the class set on the tuesday element from tue to wed
[05:07:06] <dimi1947> no I want 13:00 printed under tue
[05:08:48] <Cork> dimi1947: ya, the objects wednsday value you want it to show under tuesday
[05:10:25] <dimi1947> yes
[05:10:38] <dimi1947> exactlu
[05:11:49] <dimi1947> it is a mess
[05:12:14] <dimi1947> I just saw the mess with the classes...that is what confused you I believe...sorry
[05:12:35] <dimi1947> NOW it works....
[05:12:46] <dimi1947> after changing the classes names
[05:17:36] <Cork> dimi1947: i added the class name, i just took them from the object name
[05:17:53] <Cork> what confused me was the headers and the key names
[05:24:02] <dimi1947> cork...there is something else too...maybe I should have mention it from the beginning....go in this fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/0qtmg8cc/8/
[05:24:40] <dimi1947> in the object we are working....now you will see another object in it...with key names of open/close
[05:25:25] <dimi1947> I want to achieve the same thing but with an object like this...I though the code we have written would do the job but it does not
[05:26:10] <Cork> dimi1947: except you can't cleanly convert an object to a string
[05:26:27] <Cork> dimi1947: https://jsfiddle.net/0qtmg8cc/9/
[05:28:55] <dimi1947> so what can I do?I want only the values prrinted...no brackets....and no key names
[05:30:16] <kode_crypt> can i ask question about data table ??
[05:31:42] <dimi1947> maybe the answer is creating many objects....each object associated with a day
[05:39:41] <dimi1947> cork are yoi still there?
[05:42:20] <randomguy1> dimi1947 what's your question?  someone else may be able to help
[05:42:51] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/0qtmg8cc/ take a look at this fiddle...click the submit button
[05:43:26] <dimi1947> I want 10:00 and 13:00 printed under Monday...
[05:43:47] <dimi1947> ...as it is now 13:00 is printed under tuesday
[05:45:18] <randomguy1> looks like your setting based off of key, which in your object is 'mon' then 'wed'
[05:47:14] <dimi1947> so I should change the object key...is that what you suggest...I did not understand exactly
[05:48:54] <randomguy1> from the logic and object that you have currently, it looks as if your wanting to set each key to it's matching class, which you are doing.  for what you are wanting to happen, I'd suggest changing the object and the each to do that.
[05:48:58] <dimi1947> I made the adjustments....now to
[05:49:06] <randomguy1> am i correct in assuming the two time are start and end?
[05:49:27] <dimi1947> yes
[05:49:42] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/0qtmg8cc/
[05:50:13] <dimi1947> I made some renames....
[05:50:22] <randomguy1> consider changing your object to be: mon: { start: "10:00", end: "13:00" }
[05:51:24] <dimi1947> I fixed it.....the original problem remains though
[05:51:37] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/0qtmg8cc/15/
[05:52:25] <randomguy1> https://jsfiddle.net/0qtmg8cc/16/
[05:54:37] <dimi1947> yes...that is what I want....of course I want to do that for all weekdays....but now I have some code to start with....I will try my own....I will seek for more help if the need arises
[05:54:45] <randomguy1> :)
[05:54:58] <dimi1947> I am building a scheduling application...
[05:55:16] <dimi1947> and start/end are the working hours of a store
[05:56:31] <dimi1947> what surprises me though is that you manage to od it with an object inside another object
[05:57:05] <randomguy1> objects can be infinitely nested, provided you have the memory
[05:57:35] <randomguy1> which unless your doing something crazy isn't a real concern
[05:57:48] <randomguy1> or maybe it might be in mobile, but i'm not familiar with that realm
[06:00:37] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/eu83gqkb/20/ <--- why am I getting wrong thing on button value?
[06:00:48] <Kartagis> as*
[06:02:02] <randomguy1> buy is an object
[06:02:07] <randomguy1> change line 21 to buy.innerHTML
[06:02:57] <hai> Hey beginner here, anyone able to tell me why this changes to 0.80 but not back to 1.00  https://jsfiddle.net/ow7uh8xL/1/
[06:03:35] <randomguy1> your doing = in your comparison.  that is assignment
[06:03:41] <randomguy1> do == for comparison
[06:03:46] <randomguy1> or === if they are the same type
[06:04:05] <hai> ohh, thanks!
[06:05:00] <Kartagis> randomguy1: http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/eu83gqkb/21/
[06:05:08] <Kartagis> oh, wait
[06:05:34] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/eu83gqkb/23/
[06:06:21] <randomguy1> you need the .innerHTML on the right hand side as well
[06:06:25] <Kartagis> randomguy1: nothing on the button
[06:07:03] <randomguy1> btn.innerHTML = buy.innerHTML;
[06:07:08] <Kartagis> stillnothing
[06:07:14] <Kartagis> oh
[06:07:32] <Kartagis> I did that
[06:07:42] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/eu83gqkb/24/
[06:08:20] <randomguy1> sorry
[06:08:25] <randomguy1> btn.value = buy.innerHTML
[06:09:38] <Kartagis> yea
[06:09:46] <Kartagis> thanks, that did it
[06:10:13] <randomguy1> do you understand the difference in the two?
[06:13:11] <Kartagis> button takes value, input type button takes innerHTML?
[06:14:12] <randomguy1> k, in your case both btn and buy are dom selections.  so they represent the complete object, with all it's child elements and properties contained
[06:14:33] <randomguy1> in the case of btn its a <input type="button" value=""> or <button value="">
[06:14:45] <randomguy1> so it's accessor is btn.value
[06:15:02] <randomguy1> in the case of your buy, it is the selector of a div so <div>something</div>
[06:15:14] <randomguy1> div's by default don't have a value attribute
[06:15:27] <randomguy1> what you were after was the containing text of the element, which is .innerHTML
[07:11:21] <KnightsOfNi> Should a function be placed inside or outside the doc ready event?
[07:11:52] <randomguy1> typically outside, but they can be in either
[07:12:19] <KnightsOfNi> But then I'd have to declare all variables again inside the function?
[07:12:32] <KnightsOfNi> |I have a bunch of vars inside the doc ready event
[07:12:36] <randomguy1> no, outside functions are global so they would be available in the ready
[07:13:23] <randomguy1> if i'm not misunderstanding you
[07:19:44] <nbt> KnightsOfNi: if you have variables declared in the ready event that are also used inside the function, then you should put the function inside the event, so that it can access those variables
[07:20:09] <KnightsOfNi> nbt: but what if you need that function to be called from a different JS file?
[07:20:19] <nbt> but using vars like that is not best practice, you should try to make the function as self-contained as possible and not access outside variables
[07:20:37] <KnightsOfNi> I think so too
[07:20:51] <nbt> KnightsOfNi: well in that case the function should be outside the event handler
[07:46:41] <fris> i have a list of <li> elements with the same class, how would i go about inserting an <ul> before the first element, and </ul> after the last
[07:47:31] <randomguy1> var something = $('<ul>).append(urlist);
[07:47:38] <randomguy1> then append that to the body where ever
[07:47:56] <randomguy1> var something = $('<ul>').append(urlist);
[07:47:57] <randomguy1> missed a closing tick
[07:51:47] <fris> k i was gonna use $('.gallery:first').before("<ul>");
[07:53:13] <Mirozh> Hi there
[07:53:25] <Mirozh> I am using DataTable Jquery UI
[07:54:42] <mrbubbles> hi guys, i’m trying to make it so that when I click or press downbutton my page scrolls to the next slide. I have the following that is working for the click event, but because the keypress event is on the window $(this).next is false. http://pastie.org/10116473 can anyone suggest a better way?
[07:55:05] <Mirozh> And i have a simple question : I am using an ajax request in order to add new elements in my database form a Form. When i did it with success, i reload my <tbody> with .html() with the new data. But i would like to "synchronise" with the datatable, is there any way to Reload or Refresh this ?
[08:04:24] <Mirozh> And i have a simple question : I am using an ajax request in order to add new elements in my database form a Form. When i did it with success, i reload my <tbody> with .html() with the new data. But i would like to "synchronise" with the datatable, is there any way to Reload or Refresh this ?
[08:11:54] <decx> Mirozh: check the api it has fnDraw()
[08:12:19] <decx> Mirozh: https://datatables.net/api#fnDraw
[08:14:56] <Mirozh> Nothing happens
[08:15:11] <decx> fiddle up
[08:15:11] <Mirozh> What i did :$('#cmaapp-internship-intern-table').html(data);
[08:15:11] <Mirozh> internDataTable.fnDraw();
[08:15:30] <decx> i never used datatables
[08:22:28] <Mirozh> anyone ever use datatable ?
[08:25:17] <Meir`> Mirozh, yeah, me
[08:25:49] <Meir`> you need to refresh the current page after updating the database?
[08:27:07] <Mirozh> Exactly
[08:27:15] <Mirozh> In fact i refresh the HTML
[08:27:26] <Mirozh> and then i would like to refresh the Database,
[08:27:39] <Mirozh> if you get what i mean
[08:28:21] <Meir`> you edit a row inline? or by a form?
[08:28:38] <Mirozh> nop i just update the entirer tbody HTML
[08:28:46] <decx> doesn't datatables has its own ajax function?
[08:29:18] <Mirozh> like for example : $(''#myTBody).html(data)
[08:29:28] <Mirozh> i know this is not the best way
[08:29:39] <decx> it also has a method to add rows
[08:29:48] <Mirozh> but that's weird if we can't juste reload the datable from the HTML DOM
[08:29:59] <decx> you can probably just reinit it then
[08:30:09] <decx> but i'd say use the appropriate methods
[08:30:15] <Mirozh> Yeah..
[08:30:37] <Mirozh> Maybe if i can load the datable from an ajax request
[08:31:02] <Mirozh> like .datable({ajax : {url : myScript.php, ...}})
[08:31:10] <Mirozh> But another question then
[08:31:23] <Mirozh> How can i manage the actions Edit / Delete ?
[08:31:59] <Mirozh> Is there any callbacks ?
[08:32:22] <decx> oh now i remeber that their community wasnt too keen to embrace irc for support and preferred their own forum
[08:32:23] <Mirozh> And how to display this "special" column ? With CSS and cie
[08:32:40] <Mirozh> Oh
[08:32:43] <Mirozh> Ok
[08:32:50] <decx> someone asked them to open a datatables channel because people were in here all the time with support requests
[08:33:02] <decx> so you probably will get the best help over tehre
[08:33:27] <decx> good luck either way :)
[08:34:23] <Meir`> Mirozh, after you change the db with ajax, use ajax.reload() function
[08:34:24] <MajorTennis> I am using datatables and want to point to a column and set it to uk format or euw format but none of the columns seem to be declared anywhere in the javascript so i'm not sure how to point to them. How are the datatable columns referenced if they haven't been declared?
[08:34:47] <decx> now all the datatablelers come out of the woodwork haha
[08:35:00] <Meir`> Mirozh, look here: https://datatables.net/reference/api/ajax.reload()
[08:35:13] <MajorTennis> (i'm looking at view source and there is an 'lk' and 'vk' column being used)
[08:38:50] <Meir`> MajorTennis, uk\euw format for what?
[08:38:54] <MajorTennis> columnDefs: [       { type: 'date-uk', targets: 0 }     ],
[08:39:04] <MajorTennis> date column
[08:39:30] <MajorTennis> but i'm not sure what the date column is called
[08:39:46] <MajorTennis> because i think i could use this
[08:39:47] <MajorTennis> { "data": "Upload Date", "type" : "date-uk" },
[08:39:58] <MajorTennis> if i knew the column name
[08:40:58] <dimi1947> take a look at this fiddle....https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/0qtmg8cc/20/ whenever the user clicks the submit button....input boxes are repaced with times
[08:41:46] <dimi1947> these times are taken by a nested object....line 37 submit()....var obj
[08:42:40] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 what's the issue?
[08:43:15] <dimi1947> here is my problem....if the hours in the object have a null value (the mon for example)...how am I going to skip the iteration...I DO NOT WANT NULL printed in the browser
[08:43:40] <robertmaxrees> easy
[08:43:49] <robertmaxrees> if (this.start && this.end) { /* your code here */ }
[08:44:28] <robertmaxrees> that'll work for null, undefined, empty strings, and a few other values you probably don't want to display.
[08:44:58] <dimi1947> so you mean I do not need ===null
[08:45:15] <robertmaxrees> yup
[08:45:29] <dimi1947> I DID NOT KNOW THIS IMPORTANT THING
[08:46:08] <dimi1947> and I suppose the conditional will go inside the function associated with each
[08:46:17] <Meir`> MajorTennis, do you use the "columns" option while loading the table?
[08:46:39] <Meir`> if yes, maybe you better define the type there, instead of using columnDefs
[08:47:13] <MajorTennis> nope no columns option
[08:47:31] <MajorTennis> I think they are all decided server side
[08:49:03] <MajorTennis> I'm getting a little bit confused by some terminology , I've saved the plugin as date-uk.js and put it in the header and directory is this sufficient?
[08:49:28] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees...it does not work....the code in the conditional gets parsed even though the object content is not null...go and see it https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/0qtmg8cc/22/
[08:49:52] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you write an if, dimi1947
[08:50:09] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0qtmg8cc/23/
[08:50:57] <dimi1947> give me a second or two...
[08:52:21] <dimi1947> thanks a lot....it was very simple after all
[08:53:18] <robertmaxrees> also, fwiw, are you ever going to access the times by name?
[08:53:30] <robertmaxrees> or will you always access them by doing an .each() or something similar through them?
[08:53:44] <MajorTennis> http://paste.ee/p/icGKq this is what my datatables call looks like . many sites suggest adding the columnDefs would sufficiently ammend the format recognition
[08:53:57] <MajorTennis> howevere its not going as expected
[08:54:54] <dimi1947> I am going to adopt the current solution(each)...it works OK...why should I change it?
[08:55:06] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 that's not what i asked.
[08:55:33] <robertmaxrees> are you going to ever be accessing these by name?  or are you going to iterate through them?
[08:55:45] <robertmaxrees> the reason i ask is because it might make more sense to store those as an array instead.
[08:56:18] <dimi1947> you mean storing them in an array instead of an object?
[08:56:24] <robertmaxrees> mmhmmm.
[08:57:12] <dimi1947> is that what are you asking...I am still confused
[08:57:33] <dimi1947> I am using object cause I am building my app with backbone
[08:57:49] <robertmaxrees> right - do you need to access those times by name?
[08:58:05] <dimi1947> how else could it be?
[08:58:26] <dimi1947> can you make a quick example?
[08:58:28] <robertmaxrees> i'm suggesting that an array might be a smarter choice if you don't need to access things by key.
[08:59:45] <dimi1947> yes...I understand....but backbone uses objects to store data
[08:59:53] <robertmaxrees> arrays are objects, too.
[09:00:23] <dimi1947> still I do not understand what are you trying to say
[09:00:51] <robertmaxrees> lol put the fiddle back up - i'll show you.
[09:01:55] <dimi1947> here is thee fiddle-with the code you gave me https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/b8bzq2xb/
[09:05:49] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/b8bzq2xb/2/
[09:09:57] <dimi1947> yes I understand now....what is the benefit though of using your code?
[09:10:14] <robertmaxrees> if you're not going to access things by key, arrays are a little faster to work with
[09:10:58] <robertmaxrees> plus you ket the benefits of .map(), .forEach(), .some(), etc.
[09:11:55] <dimi1947> yes I understand now....the problem though is that if I adopt your code I will have to make some other changes to in my app...I could do it at a later stage
[09:12:48] <dimi1947> I will keep your code in a "to-do" list
[09:12:55] <robertmaxrees> it'll take you longer if you wait since there'll be more code to transition over.
[09:12:58] <robertmaxrees> but alright.
[09:13:13] <dimi1947> I understand...
[09:13:26] <dimi1947> thanks anyway
[09:41:14] <dimi1947> what syntax should I use with .css so that I can apply :hover to an element https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/ffx62dya/5/ line 55...I want the background color red on hover and not fixed as it is now
[09:41:45] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[09:42:03] <dimi1947> I can't...
[09:42:03] <robertmaxrees> you have to use jquery methods or use actual css.
[09:42:40] <dimi1947> then why you say I can't...since I can do it with jquery methods?
[09:42:42] <robertmaxrees> you cannot target psuedoclasses using jquery.
[09:42:48] <dimi1947> how?
[09:43:05] <dimi1947> oh
[09:43:22] <robertmaxrees> you can bind to the mouseenter and mouseleave event to get a similar effect.
[10:02:49] <forQuery>         $(".classA, .classB").doSomething()
[10:02:58] <forQuery> is this searching for both classB and classA?
[10:03:02] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:03:43] <forQuery> how would you change it, if you wanted it to only serch for classA inside classB?  $(".classA", ".classB")?
[10:03:48] <ph88> hey guys i would like an animation to run for at least 2 seconds or (if longer) when the ajax callback is done. Can it be done without bookkeeping variables? I have this now at the moment http://pastebin.com/8RXtdivs
[10:03:57] <robertmaxrees> forQuery the same way you would in CSS>
[10:03:58] <decx> yes that would be context forQuery
[10:04:11] <decx> more advanced that just .a .b
[10:04:14] <decx> than
[10:04:24] <robertmaxrees>  $(".classB .classA");  alternatively, $('.classb').find('.classa');
[10:04:25] <decx> .b .a even
[10:04:38] <robertmaxrees> or $('.classa', '.classb');
[10:05:36] <decx> i stopped using context mostly in favor of find
[10:05:45] <decx> only when $('.blah', this)
[10:05:47] <robertmaxrees> context uses find under the hood iirc.
[10:05:51] <decx> ye
[10:05:56] <decx> just for posterity
[10:07:11] <forQuery> thx robert
[10:07:29] <forQuery> if you have the immediate parent element cached in a selector
[10:07:37] <forQuery> is it better to use $("#childID").
[10:07:49] <robertmaxrees> yes
[10:07:49] <forQuery> or to use $parentElement.find("#childID")
[10:07:57] <robertmaxrees> the former
[10:07:59] <decx> if it's an id
[10:08:01] <forQuery> yes, thank you
[10:08:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah, if it's an ID.
[10:08:13] <decx> getElementById is always fastest
[10:08:55] <forQuery> I read in one place online.... $(document.getElementById('#element')) was faster than $("#element")
[10:09:05] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[10:09:08] <decx> negilible
[10:09:08] <robertmaxrees> totally unnecessary.
[10:09:17] <robertmaxrees> premature optimization is the devil.
[10:09:22] <decx> sizzle just checks for #
[10:09:33] <decx> and then fire getEBI itself
[10:10:01] <decx> negligible
[10:10:04] <decx> what a word
[10:10:07] <decx> jeez
[10:10:50] <decx> if you want performance at all cost you skip jquery entirely
[10:12:15] <forQuery> not smart enough to skip jquery, but i look up about 75 ids in my page, and just wanted to make it faster.
[10:12:27] <robertmaxrees> woah that's a lot.
[10:12:37] <forQuery> ill keep as $("#selector"), thx for advice :)
[10:12:38] <ph88> crazy
[10:12:52] <decx> i'd love to see that
[10:17:02] <forQuery> its just a page with a lot of settings and widgets... nothing that neat to see.
[10:36:13] <z1haze2> can someone please help me with how to submit post data from an <a>?
[10:36:25] <robertmaxrees> probably.
[10:36:44] <z1haze2> may* :)
[10:36:50] <robertmaxrees> probably.
[10:36:55] <z1haze2> hmm
[10:36:56] <robertmaxrees> (just ask your question)
[10:37:00] <z1haze2> That is my question
[10:37:08] <z1haze2> I dont know how to send parameters from the <a> to post
[10:37:24] <robertmaxrees> are you using the ajax post method?
[10:37:45] <robertmaxrees> do you have any html and/or js to share?
[10:37:49] <z1haze2> no, currently im not using any js for stuff.. its all setup for $_GET but i want to switch to $_POST
[10:38:03] <robertmaxrees> you can't post without using a form or ajax.
[10:38:24] <z1haze2> can I use ajax and reload the page?
[10:38:35] <z1haze2> ive used ajax to submit forms via an actual form before.. and just reload a div
[10:38:45] <robertmaxrees> sure, though that kind of defeats the purpose of using ajax.  why not use an actual form?
[10:38:47] <z1haze2> thats not what I'm trying to do though
[10:38:52] <z1haze2> here - ill show you
[10:39:10] <z1haze2> http://mcplayerindex.com
[10:39:17] <z1haze2> there is a form which is fine
[10:39:39] <z1haze2> BUT, links also "submit" the form and return results.
[10:39:49] <z1haze2> so i need to somehow use these links to submit $_POST data..
[10:40:20] <robertmaxrees> there are a few different ways to do it.
[10:40:38] <robertmaxrees> create a hidden form, on click of a link populate its input and submit it to do your search.
[10:40:55] <robertmaxrees> that avoids using any ajax which sounds like what you actually want.
[10:41:44] <z1haze2> im not opposed to ajax, i dont have 2 different pages
[10:41:44] <samssh> Or the hidden fields could be pre-filled, and the link is a submit button.
[10:41:47] <z1haze2> no need to ajax
[10:41:53] <robertmaxrees> z1haze2 right, so you do the form.
[10:42:05] <robertmaxrees> that';s why i'm saying the form idea sounds like what you actually want.
[10:42:10] <z1haze2> robertmaxrees, i dont even think the form has to be hidden
[10:42:23] <z1haze2> how do i populate the existing form onclick from my links?
[10:42:26] <robertmaxrees> z1haze2 you could use the form that's already on the page if you want.
[10:42:34] <robertmaxrees> you set the .val() of the input
[10:42:34] <z1haze2> can you somehow populate an input based on the ?user=value of a link
[10:42:42] <robertmaxrees> sure, you can parse it.
[10:42:56] <z1haze2> that sounds like a good idea
[10:43:03] <robertmaxrees> even better, give the links a data-* attribute of the username value.
[10:43:21] <z1haze2> O.o
[10:43:31] <z1haze2> thats beyond me, ive nver really used js before hoenstly
[10:43:40] <robertmaxrees> let me show you.
[10:43:48] <robertmaxrees> way easier than you think.
[10:44:44] <robertmaxrees> wait, why are you posting this content instead of geting it?
[10:44:49] <robertmaxrees> *GETing it.
[10:45:46] <z1haze2> because its cleaner
[10:45:55] <z1haze2> and im using tokens anyway
[10:46:00] <robertmaxrees> except you're asking the server to get data.
[10:46:05] <robertmaxrees> but whatevs: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qw8oypej/
[10:46:15] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple to populate based on a click click.
[10:46:17] <robertmaxrees> *link click
[10:46:36] <z1haze2> well the main reason is, because im making an api now, and this app will utilize post date, and my api will use get data
[10:47:19] <z1haze2> and to make it submit i just put form.submit(); after the $('input').val(currentUserName);?
[10:47:29] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[10:48:07] <z1haze2> from your whatever, i get you disagree with using $_POST?
[10:48:18] <z1haze2> you think it will slow down a lot?
[10:48:24] <robertmaxrees> i'm not whatevering, i just don't see the point.
[10:48:27] <robertmaxrees> you want to GET data
[10:48:37] <robertmaxrees> you're not sending data to the server, you're requesting data.
[10:48:51] <serge> hey robertmaxrees and arthurvr - I have a question
[10:49:07] <z1haze2> yea i understand
[10:49:16] <z1haze2> the links are just ugly
[10:49:34] <z1haze2> ?u=Graser10&token=553e72f9776c4 would be so much nicer to not see
[10:49:53] <robertmaxrees> what's the token for?
[10:50:01] <z1haze2> prevent malicious use
[10:50:07] <robertmaxrees> set that in a cookie.
[10:50:09] <robertmaxrees> not the url.
[10:50:36] <Ryu> Anyone there?
[10:50:37] <robertmaxrees> what's up serge
[10:50:43] <z1haze2> its to stop a server from running like for($=0; $i<100000000000; i++) { file_get_contents(...}
[10:50:57] <z1haze2> because that happened :(
[10:51:03] <robertmaxrees> z1haze2 right - use a cookie for that instead.
[10:51:06] <robertmaxrees> and rate limit.
[10:51:13] <z1haze2> i do rate limit
[10:51:18] <z1haze2> but if they dont have to get the form
[10:51:22] <Guest70363> I'm doing on an element click $(".content").find("div:visible").fadeOut("fast"); $("#career-design").fadeIn("fast");
[10:51:23] <z1haze2> the limit doesn help
[10:51:26] <robertmaxrees> then store the token in a cookie
[10:51:31] <Guest70363> But when I click the element a second time
[10:51:40] <z1haze2> would that work if they are file_Get_contents() from a server?
[10:51:41] <Guest70363> It just fades out everything
[10:51:42] <Guest70363> Without fading in the second thing
[10:51:53] <robertmaxrees> z1haze2 reject the request if it doesn't have the cookie.
[10:52:00] <Guest70363> Trying to make a jquery navigation bar with all te content on one page
[10:52:00] <robmal> z1haze2: Count visits from the same ip, if it exceeds 100 in one day - serve some fake data.
[10:52:01] <z1haze2> and robertmaxrees , the token updates every single page load
[10:52:03] <Guest70363> Anyone know wht the issue is?
[10:52:18] <robertmaxrees> Guest70363 care to make a fiddle?
[10:52:18] <z1haze2> here, letme show u
[10:52:27] <Guest70363> ?
[10:52:33] <robertmaxrees> z1haze2 woah wtf.  you should be creating session tokens.
[10:52:44] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ Guest70363
[10:52:44] <b-ot> Guest70363: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:53:16] <z1haze2> http://viper-7.com/pNdqt4
[10:53:21] <z1haze2> i do.
[10:53:46] <robertmaxrees> z1haze2 are you familiar with session cookies?
[10:53:51] <z1haze2> not at all
[10:53:53] <robertmaxrees> because that's exactly what you need in this case.
[10:53:56] <z1haze2> just basic sessions
[10:54:01] <serge> I have robertmaxrees: arthurvr: a question - I have a pretty strong knowledge of jQuery but want to dig into real application development. Which road should I go for? ember angular react all those things?
[10:54:08] <serge> soo much options
[10:54:08] <z1haze2> its not been exploited yet
[10:54:31] <robertmaxrees> z1haze2 you're basically trying to build out session management without using proper session management.
[10:54:37] <z1haze2> heh
[10:54:44] <robertmaxrees> :)
[10:54:45] <z1haze2> well, they dont login
[10:54:50] <z1haze2> theres no realy session management
[10:54:51] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter.
[10:54:59] <z1haze2> i just loop a counter every minute
[10:55:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:55:13] <arthurvr> well serge, I guess I can only answer that in one way, try some stuff and see what fits your mindset and what works for your requirements.
[10:55:15] <z1haze2> hey dont laugh it works lo
[10:55:23] <arthurvr> it’s really project-specifc after all, serge
[10:55:47] <Guest70363> https://jsfiddle.net/01q9b92b/4/ Help plox
[10:55:56] <serge> robertmaxrees: what do you think?
[10:56:00] <Guest70363> robertmaxrees:
[10:56:08] <robertmaxrees> z1haze2 i'm laughing because it might seem like it works, but it's something you could pretty easily circumvent.  session management is a hard thing to get really right.  i'd go with the "normal" route.
[10:56:09] <z1haze2> robertmaxrees, help me make it better?
[10:56:15] <robertmaxrees> serge same as arthurvr
[10:56:20] <robertmaxrees> kinmd of application specific.
[10:56:22] <robertmaxrees> play around.
[10:56:35] <robertmaxrees> z1haze2 i don't know PHP, so all i can do is point you ion a rough direction.
[10:56:38] <serge> robertmaxrees: arthurvr: but there seems to be so much competition
[10:56:56] <z1haze2> what were you suggesting then?
[10:57:00] <serge> the 'todomvc wars'
[10:57:07] <robertmaxrees> z1haze2 that you use actual session management.
[10:57:21] <Guest70363> Anyone? https://jsfiddle.net/01q9b92b/4/
[10:57:28] <z1haze2> but i mean what would i manage.
[10:57:36] <z1haze2> i literally juist need to track uses per minute
[10:57:46] <robertmaxrees> Guest70363 slow down duder.  trying to look.
[10:57:56] <robertmaxrees> z1haze2 right, you tie that to a session cookie.
[10:58:00] <z1haze2> easy peasy. I mean im certanly not a pro, but its 'working'
[10:58:09] <z1haze2> can i update this cookie every singl time
[10:58:22] <robertmaxrees> you could, but that's a bad idea.
[10:58:32] <robertmaxrees> don't trust the client.
[10:58:38] <arthurvr> serge: I literally helped building up those wars (I’m a todomvc team member), and I can only give you that advice TBH. I could give you my personal opinions but that wouldn’t make sense.
[10:58:50] <robertmaxrees> Guest70363 what are you trying to do here?
[10:58:52] <z1haze2> yea which is why im managing it on the server
[10:58:55] <serge> understood arthurvr
[10:59:09] <serge> robertmaxrees: what do you think? again the same as arthurvr?
[10:59:20] <Guest70363> robertmaxrees: Create a live navigation
[10:59:31] <Guest70363> Fade in content if you click on list item
[10:59:37] <Guest70363> And fade out all others
[10:59:39] <arthurvr> btw serge next time ask questions to the whole channel instead of pinging in and asking two people lol
[10:59:49] <robertmaxrees> serge i think there are some better designed libs out there, but those are my opinions.
[10:59:50] <Guest70363> That are visible
[10:59:55] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, no need to just ask the two of us :)
[10:59:59] <robertmaxrees> Guest70363 okay, one sec.
[11:01:58] <robertmaxrees> Guest70363 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/01q9b92b/5/ - your .find() call wasn't getting what you thought it was.
[11:03:32] <Guest70363> robertmaxrees: Right but say I have 20 different navigation items
[11:03:36] <Guest70363> Is there are more effecient way to do that?
[11:03:44] <Guest70363> Than fading in and out every specific element?
[11:03:52] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[11:04:16] <Emn1ty> so i've been getting this weird issue where ajax requests will remove event listeners from the dom
[11:05:14] <robertmaxrees> Emn1ty something tells me you're replacing the contents of the page.
[11:05:48] <Emn1ty> I'm using backbone
[11:06:32] <Emn1ty> let me try something
[11:06:45] <robertmaxrees> Guest70363 https://jsfiddle.net/01q9b92b/6/ roughly something like this then.
[11:09:10] <Guest70363> robertmaxrees:  Thanks
[11:09:37] <robertmaxrees> Guest70363 your .find('div:visible') was still not what you want, either way - that was applying the fadeout to much more than just the first parent.
[11:10:14] <ashopin> Hello all. I need a bit of help with what seems like easy stuff. I'm sure it's somethign stupid I'm missing but I'm trying to add the value of a few fields but I keep getting 'NaaN'.

[11:12:31] <ashopin> robertmaxrees: hmm it worked when I was testing with two fields.
[11:12:47] <robertmaxrees> parseFloat on "" gets you NaN
[11:12:57] <ashopin> ah ok
[11:13:11] <ashopin> So I have to add a condition to see if they're empty
[11:13:15] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:13:28] <ashopin> sounds good. I can set the default to b 0 then.
[11:13:29] <robertmaxrees> also: give all those inputs a shared class.
[11:13:38] <robertmaxrees> or target through a common parent or something.
[11:13:46] <ashopin> Thanks for the help.
[11:13:57] <ashopin> Unfortunately it's Drupal that spits out the classes so I dont' have too much control over it
[11:14:07] <robertmaxrees> yuck.
[11:15:41] <ashopin> Setting the default to '0' solved it. I remember running into this 8 or 9 months ago but I haven't don't jquery and calculations since.
[11:15:59] <robertmaxrees> fwiw this has nothing to do with jquery :)
[11:16:25] <ashopin> javascript too right? I've been using PHP quite a bit but don't know if I did calculation
[11:16:38] <robertmaxrees> this is purely because of a javascript thin.
[11:16:40] <robertmaxrees> *thing.
[11:18:03] <ashopin> I'll try to remember it :)
[11:26:51] <z1haze2> robertmaxrees, i think i got it all working with that little jquery you showed: http://dev.hendricksweb.com/mcnames/ - its kinda sketchy how it inputs the value into the form then submits i wish it would do it at the same time so you dont see it, but it works
[11:27:29] <robertmaxrees> that's why i suggested the hidden input ;)
[11:27:33] <robertmaxrees> but yeah
[11:41:19] <Emn1ty> robertmaxrees: what do you mean by replacing the content of the page? Currently the flow is we persist via backbone, then afterwards we re-render the entire element which has our updated data. In this render method, we re-bind the events. Which is what's confusing... it shouldn't be happening.
[11:43:52] <tasaif> Emn1ty: why don't you bind to the parent?
[11:44:03] <tasaif> event delegation or something, I can't remember what it's called
[11:44:38] <tasaif> after googling, it seems event delegation is exactly what it's called
[12:08:18] <aiglesias> hey guys
[12:08:20] <aiglesias> have a question about event binding
[12:08:26] <aiglesias> what happens if you try to bind an event handler more than once to the same element?
[12:25:07] <aiglesias> is there any way of creating a kind of "placeholder"?
[12:25:22] <robertmaxrees> aiglesias hrm?
[12:25:25] <robertmaxrees> like on an input?
[12:25:33] <aiglesias> robertmaxrees: nope
[12:25:41] <robertmaxrees> and to answer your earlier question - if you bind a listener more than once, it binds it again.
[12:25:43] <robertmaxrees> so they "Stack"
[12:25:47] <aiglesias> in other words: myEl = $('.some-element') // .some-element will be available ahead of time
[12:26:11] <robertmaxrees> .some-element needs to exist when you make the call to $()
[12:26:23] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing you're loading elements into the page and need to bind event listeners to them, yeah?
[12:26:35] <aiglesias> so that i can later check if myEl.length later and use other methods as if the first query would return results
[12:26:48] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:26:53] <aiglesias> robertmaxrees: yeahh
[12:26:59] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation.
[12:27:03] <aiglesias> but there some Angular.js sugar
[12:27:16] <aiglesias> yes, i'm trying to delegate to an element that doesn't exists as well
[12:27:16] <robertmaxrees> you need event delegation, not juggling ;)
[12:27:26] <robertmaxrees> that's not delegating then :)
[12:27:32] <robertmaxrees> you bind to a parent that always exists.
[12:29:48] <aiglesias> probably i should point the delegation into another parent element that will always exist
[12:29:53] <robertmaxrees> exact;y/
[12:29:56] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[12:30:13] <aiglesias> (Y)
[12:30:54] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/u01wtz9m/
[12:32:43] <aiglesias> robertmaxrees: yup, definitely
[12:33:01] <aiglesias> just forgot the point about event delegation
[12:33:10] <aiglesias> so much Angular lately
[12:33:30] <aiglesias> but you know, sometimes you need to tweak performance and need these delegations in directives...
[12:33:39] <aiglesias> robertmaxrees: thanks!
[12:34:57] <pauled> Hi, want to remove an element (div) that contain a certain string in span. Can you point me?
[12:36:00] <robertmaxrees> pauled you need :contains()
[12:36:02] <robertmaxrees> ?api contains
[12:36:03] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: No matches.
[12:36:14] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[12:37:21] <pauled> tried :contains but doesn't works: if ($( "span:contains('Some Word')" )) { $( "div#streams_on_air" ).remove(); }
[12:37:42] <robertmaxrees> make a quick fiddle.
[12:37:50] <pauled> ok :)
[12:47:47] <pauled> robertmaxrees: oh that works :) http://fiddle.jshell.net/ehfupx92/2/
[12:47:55] <pauled> weird :)
[12:48:12] <robertmaxrees> btw div#streams_on_air is totally unnecessary.
[12:48:27] <robertmaxrees> just do $('#streams_on_air')
[12:48:33] <pauled> ah ok :)
[12:53:56] <pauled> the xpath is //*[@id='streams_on_air']"/a/span/text() how can use it ?
[12:54:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:54:33] <robertmaxrees> you should be able to just do #streams_on_air span
[12:55:53] <pauled> I mean can I do if ($( "#streams_on_air a span:contains('Some Word')" )) { $( "div#streams_on_air" ).remove(); }
[12:56:21] <pauled> because the target can be duplicated into the same div
[12:56:42] <robertmaxrees> you don't need the div in front of the # fwiw
[12:56:46] <robertmaxrees> not sure why you keep putting that there.
[12:57:00] <pauled> oh sorry, wrong paste
[12:57:08] <pauled> I mean can I do if ($( "#streams_on_air a span:contains('Some Word')" )) { $( "#streams_on_air" ).remove(); }
[12:57:31] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what your html looks like.
[12:57:37] <robertmaxrees> i would assume that would work.
[12:57:51] <robertmaxrees> or just #streams_on_air span:contains('some word')
[12:58:04] <pauled> I will update fiddle
[12:58:26] <cleopatra> Hi people
[12:59:18] <robertmaxrees> hey cleopatra!
[12:59:34] <cleopatra> hey robertmaxrees   what new
[12:59:44] <robertmaxrees> guitar shopping right now haha
[12:59:47] <robertmaxrees> you?
[13:00:22] <cleopatra> hahahha
[13:00:23] <cleopatra> I new in the field of programming js
[13:00:29] <robertmaxrees> good times.
[13:01:18] <pauled> robertmaxrees: doesn't works :( http://fiddle.jshell.net/ehfupx92/4/
[13:01:35] <cleopatra> and well  i add this channel to my favorites If i have doutb  sometime
[13:02:03] <robertmaxrees> pauled sure it does - Target isn't inside the span.
[13:02:18] <cleopatra> my native language is Spanish'm from Venezuela apologize my poor English grammar
[13:03:03] <pauled> robertmaxrees: look if ($( "#streams_on_air span:contains('Target')" )) { $( "#streams_on_air" ).remove(); }
[13:03:19] <robertmaxrees> pauled again, the word target isn't within the span.
[13:03:41] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[13:03:54] <pauled> robertmaxrees: target is not in span, is should not remove #streams_on_air
[13:04:07] <robertmaxrees> pauled right, so the code works as written.
[13:04:31] <robertmaxrees> though i did make a mistake.  one second.
[13:05:08] <sssilver_> jQuery vs. Javascript -- thoughts?
[13:05:14] <robertmaxrees> sssilver_ jquery IS javascript.
[13:05:20] <cleopatra> use remove RemoveClass
[13:05:27] <sssilver_> robertmaxrees what do you mean?
[13:05:35] <robertmaxrees> sssilver_ jquery is written in javascript.
[13:05:41] <robertmaxrees> it's not a separate language - it's a library
[13:05:47] <sssilver_> robertmaxrees does it mean it's better than Javascript?
[13:05:52] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:05:57] <sssilver_> C is written in Assembly, doesn't mean it's assembly
[13:06:04] <robertmaxrees> c is a programming language.
[13:06:05] <robertmaxrees> jquery is not.
[13:06:12] <ashopin> Hello again. I'm trying to create a slide out panel that'll act like a Table of Contents for a form that has a lot of fields. I have a loop that seems to pull in things randomly except text fields twice: http://pastebin.com/R5KCC0Bc http://i.imgur.com/5ZxsSEL.png
[13:06:28] <cleopatra> but jquery is a library for ajavacipt handle  dom
[13:06:29] <cleopatra> ?
[13:06:48] <robertmaxrees> cleopatra yes.  it's a library that makes working with browsers much easier.
[13:06:49] <tasaif> written in javascript
[13:06:53] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[13:06:56] <robertmaxrees> it is javascript.
[13:06:59] <cleopatra> yes
[13:07:01] <sssilver_> it doesn't matter what stuff is written on!
[13:07:05] <cleopatra>   iread a lot bout jquery
[13:07:10] <robertmaxrees> sssilver_ jquery is not a programming language.  it's a library
[13:07:19] <sssilver_> robertmaxrees then C is just a library for asm?
[13:07:27] <robertmaxrees> sssilver_ ... C is a programming language.
[13:07:29] <robertmaxrees> jhquery is not.
[13:07:30] <sssilver_> jquery is powerful enough to be like a language of its own
[13:07:30] <sssilver_> it has selectors
[13:07:35] <sssilver_> selectors is almost like a language
[13:07:39] <robertmaxrees> so does native javascript.
[13:07:42] <robertmaxrees> document.querySelectorAll()
[13:08:02] <sssilver_> you can't do stuff like element.class > boo using javascript
[13:08:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:08:13] <cleopatra> .removeClass()
[13:08:14] <sssilver_> jquery is declarative programming, javascript is more like traditional
[13:08:22] <robertmaxrees> sssilver_ jquery is not a programming language.
[13:08:30] <sssilver_> who decides that?
[13:08:30] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sure why you're obsessed with the notion that it is.
[13:08:51] <robertmaxrees> http://jquery.com/ http://i.imgur.com/EYdWhBh.png
[13:08:52] <sssilver_> jQuery > Javascript
[13:08:56] <tasaif> would you call C a library to asm?
[13:09:03] <tasaif> no, so jQuery is a language
[13:09:07] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:09:16] <tasaif> QED robert QED
[13:09:16] <sssilver_> exactly ^
[13:09:25] <robertmaxrees> sssilver_ he's trolling you fyi.
[13:09:30] <sssilver_> no, he's trolling you
[13:09:31] <robertmaxrees> jquery is not a language. it's a library.
[13:09:34] <tasaif> i'm going to lunch
[13:09:49] <cleopatra> http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_intro.asp
[13:10:09] <robertmaxrees> don't use w3schools :(
[13:10:28] <robertmaxrees> pauled http://fiddle.jshell.net/ehfupx92/7/ you had invalid html.
[13:10:33] <cleopatra> What is jQuery?
[13:10:36] <cleopatra> The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
[13:10:47] <claytonzaugg> Looking for help with Widgets and views / templates.  Basically I'm trying to see how and where you call the templates.  I have a side nav that when you click a link, it will call one of the templates
[13:11:06] <aiglesias> what is JavaScript?
[13:11:08] <robertmaxrees> cleopatra w3schools is a terrible resource - the jquery page itself also makes that point, however.
[13:11:17] <cleopatra> yes
[13:11:23] <robertmaxrees> javascript is ecmascript in the browser, sort of.
[13:11:39] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, might you happen to know a link or tutorial for my question?
[13:11:51] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg views/templates in.... what?
[13:11:56] <aiglesias> they should ditch that in favor of jQuery in the browser
[13:12:01] <robertmaxrees> i disagree.
[13:12:02] <aiglesias> :P
[13:12:49] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg it sounds like you need a render method that you call when you click a link.
[13:12:51] <cleopatra> but anyway I'm trying to make a slideshow using jquery using jquery
[13:13:04] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, I have a bunch of html files with bits of html code surrounded by <script type="text/template"> and I need to know how I can load the template
[13:13:14] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[13:13:25] <robertmaxrees> that's not the right way to do that.
[13:13:33] <cleopatra> I come from ruby so jquery / javacipt is new to me
[13:13:41] <robertmaxrees> unless you use a framework/library built to do that
[13:13:54] <claytonzaugg> I've been lead astray!  Sorry robertmaxrees, just working with what I have and tyring to do this correctly.
[13:14:03] <claytonzaugg> Marionette I believe
[13:14:12] <pauled> robertmaxrees: Very nice, thanks a lot! cheers!
[13:14:14] <robertmaxrees> on backbone?
[13:14:19] <claytonzaugg> Yes
[13:14:33] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to read their docs then.
[13:14:38] <robertmaxrees> since i'm not familiar with it.
[13:14:39] <claytonzaugg> okay
[13:14:43] <robertmaxrees> they might do things that way.
[13:14:53] <claytonzaugg> I'll do that, thank you sir!
[13:15:01] <robertmaxrees> sorry i couldn't be of more help!
[13:15:15] <claytonzaugg> it's okay, you've helped before so I thought I'd try again
[13:18:59] <pauled> robertmaxrees: can I ask what is the alternative of if ( $( "#streams_on_air span:contains('Target')" ).length ) { $( "#streams_on_air" ).remove(); } in pure javascript?
[13:19:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:19:20] <robertmaxrees> sure, but why?
[13:19:34] <pauled> I want to know
[13:19:44] <pauled> just curiosity
[13:20:28] <pauled> by 'pure js' I mean without jquery
[13:20:32] <robertmaxrees> i know what you mean.
[13:20:36] <robertmaxrees> just an odd request.
[13:22:22] <pauled> robertmaxrees: I am learning, I am writting my first greasemonkey userscript http://en.lichess.org/forum/lichess-feedback/lichess-enhancer-aka-topbar-menu#1
[13:22:55] <pauled> robertmaxrees: please can some one show me alternative :)
[13:23:00] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[13:23:01] <robertmaxrees> one sec.

[13:25:08] <SimbaLion`> I have an html form which must send payment to paypal, and has 3 price options. I want to use a paypal button for simplicity, however I want to use radio buttons for the price options. Is there a way to dynamically alter some of the HTML in the form, based on the price option selected, so I can set up 3 different paypal buttons?
[13:25:10] <hrmphh> if i have var el = $("input:radio[name='foo']"), how can i use el to get the :checked value?
[13:25:20] <hrmphh> note that i dont have that selector string, just 'el' at this point
[13:25:35] <hrmphh> i know that given the string i could simply append :checked and then call .val()
[13:25:35] <robertmaxrees> el.filter(':checked')
[13:25:39] <hrmphh> word

[15:36:20] <chrispg21> is there a way to check the current element selected after a focusout event?
[15:36:57] <chrispg21> im trying to close a menu whos last li focusout position is outside the ul
[15:39:29] <robertmaxrees> you can get the element with the current focus.
[15:56:46] <banister> hi, how come $.patch and $.delete don't exist? but $.post and $.get do?

[16:00:56] <Lencl> hello
[16:01:07] <Lencl> I'm trying to figure out what jquery mobile is...
[16:01:32] <Lencl> Website says "jQuery Mobile is a HTML5-based user interface system designed to make responsive web sites and apps that are accessible on all smartphone, tablet and desktop devices"
[16:01:53] <Lencl> But the jquery functions already work on the android...
[16:02:01] <Lencl> so what's the jquery mobile really do?
[16:05:06] <tasaif> chrispg21: are you talking about input fields inside of lis?
[16:05:36] <chrispg21> tasaif: im trying to do it will li's inside a ul
[16:05:41] <tasaif> Lencl: it says it in the headline
[16:05:43] <tasaif> "A Touch-Optimized Web Framework"
[16:07:04] <Lencl> ah
[16:09:29] <chrispg21> tasaif: ultimatly im trying to close the menu when you focus out of it
[16:09:52] <chrispg21> with a keyboard
[16:12:00] <tasaif> chrispg21: so you have a set of inputs that when you're not focused on one of them, you want the menu to close?
[16:12:41] <tasaif> maybe you could do something like this
[16:12:42] <tasaif> ?
[16:12:43] <tasaif> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/152975/how-to-detect-a-click-outside-an-element
[16:12:56] <tasaif> I don't like to use stopPropagation, but that might be a way to go
[16:18:50] <chrispg21> tasaif: is there a way to check focusout on the parent only and not the children? focusout on the ul fires for all the children
[16:18:59] <chrispg21> blur seems to only fire on anchor tags
[16:22:58] <tasaif> chrispg21: so the link I showed you does that
[16:23:10] <tasaif> you put a stop propagation on the event before it hits the parent

[16:39:44] <LindsayMac> ugh.. this is seriously freaking out my clients
[16:39:46] <LindsayMac> like, hardcore
[16:39:55] <LindsayMac> a large amount of their users are mobile
[16:40:03] <robertmaxrees> if I remember right, it's an issue with document complexity.
[16:40:07] <LindsayMac> mostly apple device users because they're in Greenwich Connecticut... lol
[16:40:16] <LindsayMac> document complexity?
[16:40:32] <robertmaxrees> aye - deep, convoluted markup.
[16:41:05] <LindsayMac> would that be the cause of my coding? Or just that I'm doing some complex things?
[16:41:19] <robertmaxrees> might be your development and/or the plugin.
[16:41:47] <LindsayMac> Well.. the other flexslider instances seem to work so far so it could either be google analytics OR me
[16:42:05] <robertmaxrees> lots of reports about it on the interwebz.
[16:42:08] <LindsayMac> this particular slider sends a pageview event to GA when the slide ends and does a hash change event to the url for deep linking
[16:42:28] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  yea but I can't seem to find much regarding WHY its happening. Just people complaining about it happening
[16:49:16] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  this seems so weird because I removed any code that made this particular slider more complex than the others and its still causing issue. Right now the only difference is that this slider simply has more images in it
[16:54:38] <LindsayMac> well I gotta walk away for a bit. The last bit of info I have to throw into the pile of weird iOS8 anomalies is I added a breakpoint at my slider's fade function and the page gave me that error and reset before it even got to it. I've tossed random breakpoints on the slider script everywhere and can't seem to pinpint one where it stops it from failing
[16:54:55] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees: if you come across any other people encountering the same issues feel free to ping me :)
[16:55:05] <LindsayMac> thanks for the help
[17:07:44] <frank1> anyone here familar wityh node.js and javascript channels?
[17:07:53] <robertmaxrees> frank1 there's ##javascript
[17:07:56] <robertmaxrees> and #Node.js
[17:13:25] <robertmaxrees> well that was interesting.
[17:13:40] <rcyr> lol
[17:14:03] <robertmaxrees> they wanted me to PM one of the mods in ##javascript and get them unbanned.
[17:14:56] <frank2> hey can someone help me quick please
[17:15:15] <robertmaxrees> sup?
[17:16:08] <frank2> robertmaxrees: hey can you shoot over to node.js and have a word with sorella for me?
[17:16:18] <robertmaxrees> no, and please don't ask again.
[17:16:30] <frank2> why?
[17:16:41] <robertmaxrees> if you have issues with another channel, take it up with that channel.
[17:16:48] <frank2> i cant go in there im banned
[17:17:04] <robertmaxrees> PM the mods in question.  if you can't, there's nothing we can do to help you.
[17:17:06] <robertmaxrees> sorry.
[17:17:31] <frank2> i can solicit others to talk to him, what's wrong with that?
[17:17:52] <robertmaxrees> it makes the drama of another channel apart of this one.
[17:18:14] <frank2> what if I keep it in PMs then?
[17:18:28] <robertmaxrees> i'd really rather we not get people here involved.  if you have any other questions, feel free to PM me directly, but don't start spamming users.

[17:57:07] <DragonPunch> crap
[17:58:17] <Emn1ty> what's up?
[18:03:04] <user_corrupt> I am loading a page that calls a function which does some animation like so:           		$('#leftMeterBar').animate({height: noPercent }, 5000, 'swing');
[18:03:04] <user_corrupt>                 the page ends up getting AJAX reloaded, and at the reload the same function ends up getting called. The problem is that #leftMeterBar has already been set to a certain height, so the animation fails. Does anyone know how to make this animation explicitly start at zero?
[18:03:33] <user_corrupt> at the *end* of the reload..

[18:45:34] <Lencl> I understand what's append and selecting the element 'ul'
[18:46:34] <Lencl> but what's the object this.el do? (btw this.el = $('body'));

[19:20:05] <fas3r> Hello
[19:55:06] <SimbaLion`> Can someone help me with a bit of jquery, I'm using RateIt http://rateit.codeplex.com/documentation and I am using a hidden input field so I can post the ratings to sql using an html form. http://jsfiddle.net/nsL67bps/ however I'm not certain how to do the js to change the value of the hidden input field. Any guidance is appreciated.
[20:00:39] <jphase> SimbaLion`: the way to change the value of the hidden input in your example is with $('#ratings1').val('something');
[20:01:12] <jphase> SimbaLion`: however, it looks like you may have some confusion with what event to bind that to, or binding events in general. When do you want to set the value of the input? On what action?
[20:01:52] <SimbaLion`> I am learning still yes. What is not in the jsfiddle is the rateit plugin which is a stars rating system
[20:02:34] <SimbaLion`> it has an event for when a rating is set, so I want to use that event to change the value of the input field to whatever rating was selected
[20:04:00] <jphase> SimbaLion`: console.log('the value is: ' + value); inside that ratings event and open your console to see if the event is firing
[20:04:17] <SimbaLion`> ok
[20:05:31] <SimbaLion`> hrm, unexpected token ;
[20:06:54] <SimbaLion`> Got it! I just had a bunch of typos
[20:07:12] <SimbaLion`> thanks for your help, it got me looking in the right place :) next time I will try the console first
[20:07:18] <jphase> np
[20:24:14] <Zeranoe> Is there a simple example that changes a value if an input checkbox is checked? I'm trying to change the font of the page if the checkbox input is checked, but switch back to normal if it is unchecked
[20:25:01] <tw2113> i'd just toggle an html class depending on the state Zeranoe
[20:29:26] <unnu> i have a var of msg that could possible be null, but when i do if(msg == null){} it isn't triggering and .length says Cannot read property 'length' of null, ideas?
[20:29:26] <Zeranoe> tw2113: how do I check if the checkbox has been selected?
[20:30:15] <tw2113> http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[20:30:33] <unnu> Zeranoe: do they have the same name?
[20:31:35] <unnu> :'( why does null not == null? . . . this is my predicament.
[20:32:12] <tw2113> unnu, try with 3 ='s
[20:32:53] <unnu> tw2113, didn't help
[20:32:57] <unnu> gahhh
[20:33:02] * unnu stabs null
[20:34:17] <unnu> did a parse json on it, it is REALLY null now i guess
[20:34:19] <unnu> :P
[20:37:24] <Zeranoe> tw2113: this is probably the easiest way? http://jsfiddle.net/208a2seg/
[20:37:49] <unnu> hey tw2113, is there someplace i can get a crash course in building elements with jquery? like i want to replace the html of #mydiv with a div that has divs in it with buttons in those divs?
[20:39:23] <tw2113> i avoid touching css whenever I can with jQuery
[20:39:50] <tw2113> i'd rather use toggleClass() to add or remove classes on html, and the css is already defined in the CSS files
[20:40:13] <Zeranoe> tw2113: why is that
[20:41:03] <tw2113> because using things like .css() for css is a mess and it's also all applied inline
[20:41:05] <tw2113> unnu, http://api.jquery.com/html/
[20:42:48] <unnu> i meant like $("#mydiv").html($(div).addClass('outside').append($(div).addclass('inside').append($(button).addclass('clickMe'))));
[20:42:52] <unnu> but that looks ugly
[20:43:14] <tw2113> construct the html ahead of time in a variable and then pass the variable into .html()
[20:46:18] <unnu> gotchya
[20:46:41] <unnu> would you guys recomend any templating systems that are easy to use with jquery?
[20:46:53] <unnu> if not i can throw the html into some vars / functions or w/e
[20:48:51] <Zeranoe> tw2113: I like that idea, got rid of the if statement too. Thanks

It pulls from a lot of different files for th functionality, but her is the main o
[21:53:04] <intent> I'd be happy to put up any of the included .js files, but here is the main .php file which displays everything. The <div> is supposed to go where I commented "<!-- I want to add a <div> here -->" and "<!-- Only around this image -->": http://pastebin.com/aBT6W64X

[22:28:58] <Zeranoe> Chulbul: Did you just post a username+password in an IRC chatroom?
[22:30:08] <Uhkis> and publicly on pastebin
[22:30:13] <Chulbul> Zeranoe, yes thats just for testing purpose, I will remove those credentials, and there is no senstive data at all.
[22:30:38] <Uhkis> how is this jquery-related btw?

[23:02:54] <Chulbul> event.returnValue is deprecated. Please use the standard event.preventDefault() instead.
[23:03:40] <vinex08> sorry if i have to reask-- http://jsfiddle.net/vinex08/55z2ej92/3/   got disconnected earlier --
[23:04:30] <vinex08> so how can i make eeach box collapse one at a time
[23:09:39] <Cork> Chulbul: you can ignore that message, jquery checks that value for backwards compatibility
[23:11:53] <Chulbul> Cork, but its preventing form to get submit
[23:12:04] <Cork> Chulbul: no it isn't
[23:12:38] <Chulbul> Cork, did you check it in chrome, but here its not working?
[23:13:40] <Cork> Chulbul: i know what the message comes from, and it is just a heuristics sniff warning
[23:14:02] <Cork> it comes from jquery checking if event.returnValue are supported by the browser
[23:14:11] <Cork> and it cause nothing to not work
[23:14:40] <cyberbrai> http://jsfiddle.net/e2j7Lmdk/2/
[23:14:56] <cyberbrai> uhkis now i think they have no problem
[23:14:57] <Cork> vinex08: is this what you're looking for? http://jsfiddle.net/55z2ej92/4/
[23:15:05] <Chulbul> Cork, got it, other things might be effecting it: Received message of type object from http://platform.twitter.com, expected a string
[23:15:12] <Chulbul> this is the another warning message
[23:15:16] <Chulbul> all.js
[23:15:23] <Chulbul> just like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20351604/strange-javascript-error-in-console
[23:17:38] <vinex08> traversing, thanks!
[23:18:30] <cyberbrai> http://jsfiddle.net/e2j7Lmdk/2/ is there something wrong
[23:19:12] <Cork> cyberbrai: what's the question?
[23:19:33] <cyberbrai> ReferenceError: invalid assignment left-hand side  i am getting this error don't know why
[23:19:59] <cyberbrai> Cork actually i want to append the td to tbody on click event
[23:20:00] <Cork> cyberbrai: not in the fiddle no
[23:20:27] <cyberbrai> yes i know that but see the ng-click it's not working
[23:20:34] <cyberbrai> in fiddle
[23:20:34] <Cork> but ya, 1. always quote attribute values (role=row class=odd)
[23:20:51] <Cork> 2. either remove the id="" or give is a unique value
[23:21:29] <Cork> cyberbrai: you need to reproduce the error else it is close to impossible to tell what the problem is
[23:21:32] <cyberbrai> actually id have unique value
[23:21:34] <Cork> as the problem isn't in the fiddle
[23:21:50] <Cork> <td id="Not sure what goes here." value="007">Me</td><td id="Not sure what goes here."> <-- nope
[23:23:26] <cyberbrai> wait actually i want to append the td in tbody  and also append the checkbox while user click on it i want to delete it nothing i want but ng click not work
[23:23:30] <cyberbrai> Cork
[23:23:42] <Cork> there is no tbody to append it to
[23:23:55] <cyberbrai> in my ui
[23:24:16] <cyberbrai> <tr role=row class=odd><td id="Not sure what goes here." value="007">Me</td><td id="Not sure what goes here."></td><td id="Not sure what goes here."></td><td id="Not sure what goes here."><input type="checkbox" ng-click="reverse(username, id, r)"></td></tr>
[23:24:24] <cyberbrai> see th ng-click it's not work
[23:24:29] <cyberbrai> ng-click="reverse(username, id, r)"
[23:24:41] <Cork> cyberbrai: repeating the html in here, or repeating the question over and over won't help
[23:24:55] <Cork> you need to fill in the information in the fiddle needed to answer the question
[23:25:17] <Cork> sure i can create a tbody and inject the html there
[23:25:21] <Cork> but it won't help you
[23:28:10] <jac0bz1> Hello! Anyone here seen "uxpin.com"? I'm looking for a similar paid or open source jquery (or just regular javascript) app that basicly is a WYSIWYG-editor.. Like for creating a singlepage html presentation
[23:29:09] <Cork> jac0bz1: wysiwyg editors are normally independent of frameworks
[23:30:13] <Cork> ckeditor is a common one
[23:31:26] <jac0bz1> Well the one uxpin has created, is a more "drag-drop" editor
[23:31:26] <jac0bz1> http://blog.uxpin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/UXPin-properties-editor-4.png
[23:32:00] <Cork> that looks more like a mock designer
[23:32:38] <Cork> like ex. https://moqups.com/
[23:32:44] <jac0bz1> yes.. but it creates HTML
[23:32:55] <Cork> and ya, you're most likely not going to find many of those
[23:33:03] <Cork> (that you can pull in as a library)
[23:33:44] <jac0bz1> I've found zedity.com, but it did't fit my needs
[23:43:05] <jac0bz1> hmm... howabout a plugin that allows rotate and scale, like this one: http://vremenno.net/examples/jquery-ui-rotation/ (I dont like this since the cursors dont change when edges changes position)
