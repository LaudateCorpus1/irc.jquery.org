[02:50:49] <JosefDe> Hi guys. Why does this not work?: $('.chocolat-img:visible')?
[03:00:47] <JosefDe> Ah I know..
[03:01:47] <JosefDe> no I don't know :(
[03:17:24] <slax0r> because your selector is wrong?
[03:20:04] <JosefDe> slax0r: What's wrong about my selcetor?
[03:24:23] <slax0r> it's not matching the element
[03:26:44] <slax0r> https://jsfiddle.net/8vudtasf/
[03:26:52] <slax0r> see? selector works, if it matches the element just fine
[03:27:09] <slax0r> so I'm guessing you have a typo somewhere, or you are trying to access it before it even exists
[03:30:36] <Cork> or you expect the selector result to dynamically update (something it won't do)
[03:41:08] <JosefDe> Ok. I have a problem
[03:41:22] <JosefDe> I'm using this library: https://github.com/seikichi/tiff.js/
[03:41:56] <JosefDe> And when I try to load a tiff-file I get this exception: Cannot enlarge memory arrays in asm.js. Either (1) compile with -s TOTAL_MEMORY=X with X higher than the current value 16777216, or (2) set Module.TOTAL_MEMORY before the program runs.
[03:57:11] <Cork> JosefDe: tried googling?
[03:58:11] <Cork> cause https://github.com/seikichi/tiff.js/issues/7 is the first hit when looking
[05:20:44] <nondo> Hi this question is an easy cake. So, I have a <ul> with  a variable no. of <li> and each <li> is an <a class="rs-dropdown-link"> with some text. Now I want to do something when each <a> is clicked. How do I do that? If I just do $('a.rs-dropdown-link').click() then only the click event for the first <li> is firing.
[05:21:26] <Cork> nondo: no, that should fire all of them
[05:21:38] <Cork> nondo: could you create a jsfiddle.net demo of the problem?
[05:21:54] <nondo> Cork: Sure. Yes.
[05:23:29] <nondo> Cork: $('a.rs-dropdown-link').click(function() { 	$('#port-indicator').html($(this).text()); });
[05:23:48] <Cork> nondo: https://jsfiddle.net/
[05:26:12] <nondo> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/tLj01uy0/1/
[05:27:03] <nondo> Cork: I've left out some JS code that is not needed to get around this.
[05:28:56] <Cork> nondo: well the fiddle doesn't help much as it depends on none standard features
[05:29:00] <Cork> but this might help https://jsfiddle.net/tLj01uy0/2/
[05:29:37] <Cork> nondo: if you could populate the "ports" with a static array so the code runs it would help
[05:30:32] <Cork> (notice the change in line 10)
[05:31:04] <lulul> morning guys i have the following div https://jsfiddle.net/1qxapsf7/ with two lines of js so far. This part was pulled and adapted for the jsfiddle so it's not the entire js. My question is how can i search in that prototype var that holds the html template id test_surveyOption_0_headquarter and remove an option from there  ?
[05:32:27] <Cork> lulul: firstly var collectionHolder: $() isn't valid js
[05:32:31] <Cork> it needs to be =
[05:32:44] <Cork> secondly use .find('selector')
[05:33:06] <Cork> (and .remove())
[05:33:16] <lulul> Cork sorry forgot to modify that part. it's pulled from a larger code =D
[05:34:04] <lulul> Cork TypeError: prototype.find is not a function :D
[05:34:38] <Cork> lulul: you can't use prototype as that is a string
[05:34:43] <Cork> you need to use collectionHolder
[05:34:49] <lulul> found out now =D
[05:35:10] <Cork> also i would recommend avoiding the variable name prototype as that has a special meaning in js
[05:35:19] <lulul> ok :-)
[05:35:22] <lulul> i will modify it
[05:35:29] <Cork> Array.prototype for example :)
[05:35:40] <Cork> (or Object.prototype)
[05:35:56] <Cork> and jQuery.prototype :D
[05:37:38] <nondo> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/tLj01uy0/3/ < Can you run this locally and check.
[05:38:51] <Cork> nondo: when it is written correctly it works in the site
[05:46:05] <Cork> nondo: something like this (not working donno why) https://jsfiddle.net/tLj01uy0/6/
[05:46:08] <Cork> but i got to run
[06:01:11] <nondo> Cork: Yeah say if there's some text in <span> tag that you wish to change to the <li> text when the <li> is clicked, how do you go ahead? I added some default text to the span in https://jsfiddle.net/tLj01uy0/6/ but why doesn't the span text show in preview, somthing wrong?
[06:02:57] <nondo> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/tLj01uy0/7/ < Here "Select port" text is not showing in the preview. Wonder why so? I hope you can get what I'm trying to say now?
[06:08:17] <m1su> nondo: you don't have an element with the id "ports", so $('#ports').on('click',...); won't do anything
[06:12:09] <nondo> m1su: https://jsfiddle.net/tLj01uy0/10/ < This fiddle should display "Select port" text in preview. What about this?
[06:14:10] <nondo> m1su: Hey, sorry I's expecting it to run automatically.
[06:15:13] <nondo> m1su: https://jsfiddle.net/tLj01uy0/10/ code runs fine but in my app it doesn't function as expected.
[06:16:38] <m1su> well without seeing more of your html / js code there's really not much more we can tell you
[06:26:20] <nondo> m1su: Hey sorry for the inconvenience. If you check this > https://jsfiddle.net/tLj01uy0/11/ you will find the onGetDevices which populates the <li> elements. In my app there's only one <li> element and the rest are being populated using the onGetDevices function so I want the $('a.rs-dropdown-link').click to work on the ones populated by onGetDevices also.
[06:27:14] <nondo> m1su: And that is not happening with my JS code in https://jsfiddle.net/tLj01uy0/11/
[06:28:18] <aperyon> hey guys! how can i add jQueryUI event to a jQueryUI target element?
[06:40:33] <m1su> nondo: if you are adding the li elements dinamycally you need to use event delegation, Cork gave you an example
[06:40:52] <JosefDe> Hi guys. I'm using jQuery's $.Deferred() together with default Javascript XHR. For some reason my parameters I pass with $.Deferred.resolve() don't reach the .then() or .done()-handlers
[06:40:58] <m1su> nondo: something like: $('#ports').on('click', 'a.rs-dropdown-link', function(event) {..
[06:41:27] <nondo> m1su: I'll try that. Thanks.
[06:44:35] <nondo> Cork: Thanks. Your solution helped.
[06:44:40] <nondo> Cork: :)
[06:47:20] <JosefDe> Has some an idea how I can fix my problem?
[06:58:27] <iaj> Hi there :)
[06:58:45] <iaj> Does someone know of a nice plugin, that allows an image that can be rubbed with another image underneath?
[06:59:05] <iaj> Something like a scratchcard
[07:00:12] <iaj> That can be told to: if 80% are reached, fire an event?
[07:03:21] <Cork> JosefDe: the only thing i can think of is that the browser might throw the values away so they get gc:ed before the done function
[07:03:30] <Cork> JosefDe: this happens in some async cases
[07:03:49] <JosefDe> Cork: Ok. But how can I prevent that? That is strange like hell :)
[07:03:53] <Cork> JosefDe: if you could make a jsfiddle showing the exact case it would make answering it much simpler
[07:04:02] <JosefDe> ok. Let me do it
[07:04:21] <Cork> JosefDe: if that is what happens creating a local variable and assigning the value to it should fix it
[07:04:40] <JosefDe> Cork: Which value would I assign?
[07:04:47] <JosefDe> The "Deferred"-value?
[07:04:50] <Cork> the value from the variable that gets lost
[07:05:25] <Cork> ex var response = data.response; resolve(response) instead of resolve(data.response)
[07:05:40] <JosefDe> Ok. But that sounds really dirty :)
[07:05:42] <Cork> but again this is a lot of assumption
[07:06:02] <JosefDe> So a global variable?
[07:06:06] <Cork> no
[07:06:09] <Cork> local
[07:06:28] <JosefDe> And where would I store it?
[07:06:29] <aperyon> does any1 has any idea how to drag multiple events with fullCalendar.js?
[07:06:51] <Cork> an example done(function(data) { var response = data.response; setTimeout(function() { resolve(response); }) })
[07:07:00] <Cork> i think that was one of the cases where this can happen
[07:07:19] <Cork> (as data i never used outside the setTimeout the browser might think it is never used and kill the reference
[07:07:26] <JosefDe> The function where I say $.Deferred.resolve() is a separate then the function where I apply then() and done() on $.Deferred
[07:07:28] <Cork> and then the gc removes the value as nothing references it)
[07:07:42] <Cork> JosefDe: that isn't the problem
[07:08:14] <Cork> anyway we are spinning on air here, something more concrete would be good
[07:08:41] <JosefDe> The variables I pass to def.resolve(image, canvas); are assigned to variables
[07:13:14] <jquery338> why does not cookie save? ---> http://jsfiddle.net/jhMfw/25/
[07:19:30] <JosefDe> Well if I remove the .then()'s only in this case my "done" gets the correct parameters
[07:20:19] <Cork> hmm
[07:20:22] <Cork> weird
[07:20:31] <Cork> JosefDe: how are you calling .then?
[07:23:48] <JosefDe> Cork: It's looks like this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d91b4c1f8c4a22c06e67eb193f1a18bb
[07:24:13] <JosefDe> preload() returns $.Defferred()
[07:24:16] <JosefDe> And resolves it
[07:25:04] <Cork> preload? don't think i've ever heard of that one
[07:41:11] <jquery338> how to save cookie when reload ---> https://jsfiddle.net/qcgt7cmo/13/
[07:42:51] <JosefDe> Cork: That is a normal function
[07:42:58] <JosefDe> Cork: It only returns $.Deferred() and resolves it
[07:44:52] <Cork> JosefDe: ya, i'm only guessing so...
[07:44:59] <Cork> can't do much more with what i have
[07:45:18] <Cork> jquery338: why fiddle with cookies?
[07:45:27] <Cork> use indexeddb or localstorage
[07:45:48] <Cork> it usually much more stable to depend on the the cookie string concating
[07:46:11] <Cork> (and a plus is it doesn't bloat the http requests)
[07:46:55] <jquery338> Cork: ok, but do you know to solve this issue ?
[07:47:13] <Cork> with $.cookie? no
[07:47:35] <Cork> i don't use it cause i've found it too unstable and wasteful
[07:48:08] <jquery338> ok, how do you do this in your way?
[07:48:12] <decx> $.cookie is dead
[07:49:04] <jquery338> how to fix this so it is like cookie then? =/ --> https://jsfiddle.net/qcgt7cmo/13/
[07:50:24] <Cork> jquery338: https://jsfiddle.net/qcgt7cmo/15/
[07:51:59] <Cork> hmm jsfiddle seams to block localStorage...??
[07:52:53] <Cork> ah, sorry forgot to remove the value in the getter >_<'
[07:53:01] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/qcgt7cmo/16/
[07:55:06] <Cork> ah, third-party cookies block localstorage too
[07:55:08] <Cork> interesting
[07:57:02] <jquery338> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/qcgt7cmo/16/
[07:57:21] <jquery338> its not saved ?
[07:57:41] <Cork> it is blocked cause jsfiddle uses a third party domain for the display
[07:57:54] <Cork> fiddle.jshell.net
[07:58:08] <Cork> and cookies and localstorage are blocked on that by default by browsers
[07:59:20] <jquery338> Cork: ok
[08:03:12] <jquery338> Cork: how to save it then =) ?
[08:03:24] <Cork> you can't on jsfiddle
[08:05:41] <jquery338> Cork where can I test it?
[08:06:05] <Cork> jquery338: set up a local webserver
[08:08:15] <jquery338> Cork : http://codepen.io/anon/pen/mArEbO
[08:08:57] <jquery338> Cork : I have also tried doing by localhost (wamp) didnt save the "cookie"
[08:09:21] <Cork> jquery338: codepen also uses cross host
[08:09:35] <Cork> all online run js does it, else they rist leaking user info
[08:13:05] <jquery338> Cork : okey, but are you sure this code working? cause I have tried it on my localhost.. and it doesnt save the green color
[08:15:19] <Cork> jquery338: yes it works, i use it in production (not the key and value but ... ya)
[08:16:18] <jquery338> Do I miss anything to load then? some script? cause when I reload page the class "green" is gone
[08:16:38] <jquery338> Cork
[08:17:00] <Cork> no cause localStorage is native to js
[08:17:11] <Cork> you might have a browser extension blocking it though
[08:17:20] <chrisml> yo, i have select inputs with name="date_to" and "date_from", how can i write a selector to target both? $('select[name=^date]') ?
[08:17:51] <jquery338> Cork no extensions in my browser
[08:17:57] <Cork> chrisml: $('select[name="date_to"], select[name="date_from"]')
[08:18:11] <Cork> chrisml: or just give them a class
[08:18:11] <chrisml> Cork surely i can target both with one
[08:18:28] <Cork> chrisml: sure, but you can't know you will only find those
[08:18:44] <chrisml> i'm pretty sure :D
[08:19:16] <chrisml> got it, [name^=date]
[08:19:25] <Cork> you can use start with and end with attribute selectors, but those are bad performing
[08:19:40] <jquery338> Cork : I have put this code --> https://jsfiddle.net/qcgt7cmo/15/   ..... in a Html file just to test
[08:19:51] <Cork> so if you go that route make sure to run it as sparsly as possible
[08:19:55] <jquery338> And that code works for you?
[08:20:26] <Cork> i don't know if local storage works from file://
[08:20:36] <Cork> but yes, from a local web server it works just fine
[08:20:59] <Cork> except getItem("bodyclass", "green") should be getItem("bodyclass")
[08:22:39] <jquery338> Cork : like this $("body").addClass(localStorage.getItem("bodyclass"));
[08:22:46] <Cork> yes like in /16
[08:24:55] <jquery338> Cork : in 16 the green is out.. so it will never get color green
[08:30:19] <jquery338> Cork : do this html works for you --->  http://pastebin.com/ECUKBZeS
[08:34:25] <AdamPDotty> a browser would probably display something
[08:36:32] <AdamPDotty> https://validator.w3.org/#validate-by-upload
[08:37:50] <AdamPDotty> <style> should be inside head, <script> also, never directly in <html>
[08:38:17] <AdamPDotty> Empty title is not valid, charset declaration would be nice.
[08:39:46] <jquery338> Cork : solved it! https://jsfiddle.net/qcgt7cmo/21/
[09:02:28] <jedrek> I am doing animations using CSS transitions and jQuery's add/remove class
[09:03:02] <jedrek> can I overwrite or inject a property into an existing class?
[09:03:55] <Cork> jedrek: you can but it is really REALLY strongly discouraged
[09:04:18] <Cork> jedrek: the reason is you have to modify the documents stylesheats and that means the browser have to rerender the entire page
[09:04:22] <Cork> and ja...
[09:04:38] <Cork> jedrek: so the recommendated solution is to do it by combinding classes
[09:05:04] <Cork> .class1.extended-feature or something like that
[09:07:01] <jedrek> Cork: ah, I didn't think about a redraw
[09:16:11] <decx> what do you want to inject
[09:16:16] <decx> coordinates?
[09:26:29] <lilalinux> How do I get all foo[x] values of a FormData object?
[09:38:48] <lulul> is it posbile to use :selected combined with on ?
[09:38:49] <lulul> :/
[09:47:06] <decx> yes
[09:52:13] <shoky_> well yes but you can't usually put event handlers on <option>s, at least it doesn't work cross-browser iirc
[09:52:53] <shoky_> o they're gone anyway
[09:52:55] <AdamPDotty> you put them on the select
[09:53:09] <shoky_> select doesn't have :selected
[09:53:19] <AdamPDotty> :selected is not an event handler
[09:53:28] <shoky_> nobody said it is ;p
[10:04:29] <relipse> ok i'm using response()->json([],400); and my jquery ajax request is erroring out with "HTTP/1.0 400 Bad Request Cache-Control: no-cache Content-Type:  application/json {"error":"Credit card number is too short"}" having a parse json error on the "HTTP" Is there a way to get $.ajax() to parse this properly?
[10:08:39] <lulul> what i'm i doing wrong here to run the same function for on change option and on select option http://notey.it/n/dGhw ? :D
[10:12:50] <AdamPDotty> Might be different syntax. I only know $(document).on('change select', '.headquarter', replaceSelect);
[10:17:27] <lulul> AdamPDotty found the problem why it doesn't work :D
[10:18:02] <AdamPDotty> great
[10:21:01] <shoky_> relipse: uhmm the HTTP is not supposed to be part of the request body.. jquery is not supposed to see that - if it is then you got something really weird going on with your backend ;p   also for a proper error status i think jquery won't parse any json automatically
[10:22:07] <shoky_> response body, not request body
[10:23:35] <relipse> shoky_: yeah this is really weird, laravel 5's response()->json([]) fails to work with jquery's $.ajax() it plops the header into the response text
[10:23:57] <relipse> and jquery says it is failing to parse
[10:24:18] <relipse> i think because headers have already been sent!!
[10:24:59] <shoky_> relipse: then you're not using it properly.. for sure. i donno laravel myself, sorry
[10:26:46] <lulul> haha damn i hate sometimes coding :))
[10:26:52] <lulul> specially when you work with selectors and stuff
[10:27:03] <shoky_> relipse and yea you're sending headers before already with a different status (probably 200)
[10:27:12] <shoky_> otherwise jquery would not even try to parse the json
[10:27:15] <lulul> AdamPDotty do you think you can help me with something ?
[10:29:36] <lulul> AdamPDotty i have in my select option a placeholder with value null i don't want to target that one to add disabled on him. how can i do it ? :D http://notey.it/n/dGhy
[10:31:43] <shoky_> lulul: what do you mean value null?
[10:32:04] <lulul> shoky_ fixed =D
[10:32:30] <lulul> instead of [value='0'] i had to put [value = '']
[10:32:30] <lulul> :D
[10:34:58] <relipse> shoky_: here is the proof: http://i.imgur.com/UI4wnfA.png
[10:36:25] <shoky_> relipse: yea it's what you said... as you can see  `status: 200` so 200 is being sent before
[10:36:47] <shoky_> well in your screenshot the later status is also 200, not 400 like you said before
[10:40:46] <relipse> shoky_ :yeah i swithced it to 200 just to see if that would work but that didn't work either
[10:41:03] <relipse> so its like the headers are being sent in the wrong spot
[11:11:59] <shoky_> they're being sent twice maybe
[11:12:12] <shoky_> probably
[11:16:37] <relipse> shoky_ I think i found out what is happening
[11:16:51] <relipse> look at this __toString() function: http://hastebin.com/ayidocayug.php
[11:16:58] <relipse> inside of symfony framework
[11:17:13] <relipse> it pops the headers right in there with the content
[11:42:02] <_TWG> Is there a way to use jquery to print a form after it's been filled in?
[11:46:31] <_TWG> Is there a way to use jquery to print a form after it's been filled in?
[11:50:07] <relipse> _TWG: what do you mean print, like print on paper?
[11:50:32] <_TWG> Yeah.  We have a form that people need to fill in and then print so they can sign it and then bring it to us.
[11:53:37] <relipse> What happens i you just print the page after they fill it out? i believe window.print() would work in javascript
[11:53:54] <relipse> you should be abel to detect when they've filled it out and then pop up the print dialog
[11:54:41] <robertmaxrees> why not just use a pdf?
[11:56:14] <relipse> yeah _TWG that may be the best approach, use a server side language to generate a pdf with a signature line and they can print the pdf themselves
[11:56:19] <relipse> good idea Robdgreat
[11:56:22] <relipse> robertmaxrees
[11:56:38] <robertmaxrees> trying to print from a page is an exercize in pain
[11:57:05] <robertmaxrees> there are also online "signature" services that basicall allow you to "digitally sign" things.
[11:57:44] <_TWG> Well there is a lot of other stuff on the page that doesn't need to be printed.  This page was last updated back in 2000 so I think I'm just going to make a PDF for the form.
[11:57:48] <_TWG> Sorry to but everyone.
[11:58:43] <_TWG> robertmaxrees: there are a lot of state requirements on how the form can be delivered to us and digitally is not one of them so the online signature wouldn't work.
[11:59:07] <robertmaxrees> just making sure i point it out :) we signed most of our house buying paperwork that way.
[12:00:30] <_TWG> I did too and it's great but my full time job has a lot of hoops to jump through.  if I was doing it freelance for someone, I would use the digital signing.
[12:00:42] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:10:21] <m1911> any advice about change default input［file］stylefilestyle by css？
[12:15:05] <robertmaxrees> stylefilestyle?
[12:19:15] <MikeD_> is there a way to get a list of all the applied style directives from a jquery object reference, rather than using the debugger to navigate dom to the node you want to inspect?
[12:20:05] <MikeD_> like .css('fontSize') but without having to specify each property
[12:20:44] <jak2000> hi all
[12:21:24] <jak2000> how to check if a tbody have tr's? i try: var rowCount = $('#myTable >tbody >tr').length;   and/or var rowCount = $('table#myTable tr:last').index();  but not... always give me 0, of course table name(Id) i correct....
[12:21:39] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 check the .length
[12:22:29] <jak2000> $("#myTable").attr('rows').length;   not work :(
[12:22:36] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:22:39] <robertmaxrees> .find('tr').length
[12:22:44] <robertmaxrees> rows isn't an attribute.
[12:22:50] <shoky_> ugh what an annoying chrome bug.. i got the same site open in 2 tabs, it loads some css files.. each time i refresh one of the tabs, then i go to the other tab and some css files literally vanish from the devtools, and their css is no longer applied
[12:23:15] <shoky_> if i uncheck+check anything in the elements tab css, it's suddenly fixed
[12:23:18] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ that's an interesting question - what are you trying to do with that info?
[12:23:34] <robertmaxrees> shoky_ i've seen stuff like tha tbefore.
[12:23:41] <robertmaxrees> it's super annoying.
[12:23:46] <jak2000> now return me 2, because count the tr of the thead section right?
[12:23:59] <shoky_> i've seen the symptom before,  first time i notice it's the css vanishing
[12:24:00] <MikeD_> I'm trying to debug css inside an embedded browser, so I don't have the debugger... but i do have a command evaluator
[12:24:37] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ ah.  when you say embedded do you just mean a mobile device?
[12:24:46] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 depends on what you did.
[12:25:23] <MikeD_> no, it's a win32 app that uses IE to display the application... which is dependent on the win32 environment for data
[12:25:29] <robertmaxrees> aaaah.
[12:25:35] <robertmaxrees> fair enough.
[12:25:57] <MikeD_> i think i'm working off past-life karma for being a very bad person
[12:26:02] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[12:28:33] <decx> getComputedStyle(node) maybe
[12:29:00] <decx> it's got all the things
[12:29:45] <m1911> ha？
[12:34:37] <MikeD_> do i need to use .get(0) on the jquery object to feed .getcomputedStyle() ?
[12:34:47] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[12:34:53] <decx> yeah it takes a node
[12:37:12] <MikeD_> getComputedStyle( $('body').get(0) )  //  {}    (and any other selector i use returns empty object too)
[12:39:22] <robertmaxrees> that's working for me.
[12:39:39] <MikeD_> it's probably an IE thing
[12:40:38] <MikeD_> when i look at the return from .get(0) i'm seeing an object with two props:  jQuery111002752255876096159 and sizzle-1475163785679
[12:40:43] <MikeD_> what's "sizzle" ?
[12:40:51] <robertmaxrees> sizzle is jquery's selector engine.
[12:41:26] <MikeD_> hmm... things you learn :)
[12:41:32] <robertmaxrees> it's like 75% of why people like jquery.
[12:42:00] <robertmaxrees> and fwiw getComputedStyle($('body').get(0)) works fine for me in IE
[12:42:56] <MikeD_> cool, so what does it mean if {} is all i see?
[12:43:39] <robertmaxrees> what version of IE is this embedded setup using?
[12:43:55] <robertmaxrees> also: i wonder if that follows different rules or something.
[12:44:02] <MikeD_> IE10 in IE7 mode
[12:44:06] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[12:44:19] <robertmaxrees> old IE doesn't support getComputedStyle
[12:44:48] <MikeD_> :)
[12:44:56] <robertmaxrees> and 7 is way old IE.
[12:56:16] <decx> old ie has its own getComputedStyle
[12:56:31] <decx> directly on the node, node.currentStyle
[13:02:03] <MikeD_> cool
[14:41:11] <roflmyeggo> very simple question: why do you need to reselect an element when iterating over a jQuery object-like array using $('li').each(function() { $(this) }) for example
[14:41:37] <roflmyeggo> if $('li') returns a jQuery-like object array, shouldn't each one passed in be a jquery-like object _already_?
[14:54:42] <taplar> roflmyeggo: you may not need to wrap the element to do what you want
[14:55:01] <taplar> if it always wrapped that would encur the associated overhead
[14:55:50] <taplar> so it's up to the user to make that decision
[14:56:09] <roflmyeggo> taplar: ok cool, that makes sense :D
[14:56:10] <roflmyeggo> thanks
[15:50:22] * taplar double checks that he hasn't been disconnected
[15:52:46] <taplar> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr6KVNt-1Ek <-- good times
[16:10:11] <ekkis> I'm using jquery-form to submit a form.  when I look at the request sent to the server I see the content-type set to 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8'
[16:10:38] <ekkis> even though I'm doing f.ajaxForm({success: xx, dataType: 'json'})
[16:10:50] <robertmaxrees> dataType != contentType
[16:10:53] <ekkis> I would expect the dataType to change that content type but it doesn't seem to
[16:11:00] <ekkis> oh... really?
[16:11:12] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ -> "The type of data that you're expecting back from the server"
[16:11:30] <ekkis> ah, shit
[16:11:35] <robertmaxrees> if you want to change the contentType, use contentType :)
[16:12:21] <robertmaxrees> and you'd want to set that to application/json
[16:12:21] <ekkis> ok, different question: I have 2 forms, one of them seems to submit as json the other as url encoded... both use ajaxForm for submission... how is that being done?
[16:12:32] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea without seeing it.
[16:12:38] <ekkis> fair enough
[16:12:43] <taplar> do they have different methods?
[16:12:48] <ekkis> yes
[16:12:53] <taplar> probably that
[16:12:59] <ekkis> but they're both posts and handled by the same server
[16:13:03] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:13:07] <taplar> huh?
[16:13:08] <robertmaxrees> but you just said they're different methods.
[16:13:11] <taplar> lol
[16:13:16] <robertmaxrees> they can;t be different methdos and both be posts.
[16:13:23] <ekkis> the forms are both declared simply like <form action="/method" method="post">
[16:13:31] <robertmaxrees> so they're the same method.
[16:13:31] <taplar> so, no, not different methods
[16:14:06] <ekkis> taplar: I'm sorry, I misrepresented it.  yes, same method: post
[16:14:11] <ekkis> different "actions"
[16:14:19] <robertmaxrees> same ajax code?
[16:14:39] <taplar> he's using a plugin that converts them to ajax automagically
[16:14:50] <ekkis> both use ajaxForm and declare only a success method
[16:14:56] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[16:15:54] <ekkis> ok... maybe there's another possibility.  maybe the form I think works actually doesn't.  I guess I need to test it again
[16:15:59] <ekkis> it makes no sense otherwise
[17:18:11] <taplar> anyone ever see in jQuery 1.11 for IE 11 using val('[04]') actually sets the value as just '4'?
[17:18:30] <taplar> weirdness
[17:26:33] <taplar> nvm, probably a stupid data() issue
[17:28:32] <taplar> yup, lol
[17:29:29] <dgsjm> is anyone familiar with interact.js?
[18:01:15] <nolski> How can I bind `this` into the promise returned from $.post?
[18:11:05] <theskillwithin> http://devtipsshow.com/killingitwithjquery/
[18:35:34] <NTrash_> robertmaxrees where art thou
[18:43:11] <taplar> nolski: what are you trying to do exactly?
[18:45:07] <nolski> taplar: I'm making a series of ajax calls inside of a react component and using promises to do them synchronously. I want to reference the react component inside of the promise
[18:46:20] <taplar> so your wanting to do something like $.post().then( someothermethod.bind( this ) ) ?
[18:54:08] <taplar> NTrash: you need something?
[18:54:31] <robertmaxrees> NTrash don't just ping one person.
[18:54:33] <robertmaxrees> ask the channel yo.
[19:20:09] <NTrash> Any idea why the fadeIn() doesn't work? https://jsfiddle.net/68vvud86/
[19:27:56] <NTrash> Sorted it, https://jsfiddle.net/1a7y8g8j/ very embaressing ~
[19:33:21] <robertmaxrees> nah, just confused ;)
[20:02:41] <roflmyeggo> is there a way to bind a handler for an event with priority, regardless of the order of assignment for an element?
[20:04:50] <taplar> iirc, there is not
[20:06:02] <roflmyeggo> taplar: ah, thanks for the tip
[20:20:27] <acidjazz> am i on crack
[20:20:30] <acidjazz> $('.notice').on('click', '.inner > .close > .inner', this.d);
[20:20:56] <taplar> ?
[20:21:01] <acidjazz> i am
[20:21:03] <acidjazz> i cant this.d
[20:21:06] <acidjazz> wrong this
[20:21:07] <acidjazz> :)
[20:31:14] <theskillwithin> duude can't wait for this http://devtipsshow.com/killingitwithjquery/
[20:31:31] <taplar> lol, spamming the room eh?
[20:31:40] <theskillwithin> excited for it
[20:31:56] <theskillwithin> he announced it so long ago
[20:36:32] <acidjazz> who is he
[20:36:36] <acidjazz> is that you
[20:40:45] <Khudher> Hello, i Would like a version of jQuery that is commented (or something with long variable names) for learning purposes
[20:40:51] <Khudher> any help?
[20:41:10] <taplar> you can get the unminified files from the site, or any of the various cdns out there
[20:41:25] <acidjazz> Khudher: just look in src/
[20:41:36] <taplar> but if your looking for something with lots of comments detailing what it going on, probably not going to find that
[20:41:37] <acidjazz> Khudher: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/master/src
[20:41:44] <acidjazz> Khudher: jquery is packaged up of many stuff
[20:41:48] <acidjazz> from*
[20:42:19] <taplar> Khudher: are you trying to learn about jquery or about how jquery does what it does?
[20:42:34] <Khudher> acidjazz, do all those scripts work separately ?
[20:42:40] <Khudher> taplar, how jQuery does it work
[20:42:47] <solice> https://www.paulirish.com/2010/10-things-i-learned-from-the-jquery-source/
[20:42:47] <taplar> k
[20:43:02] <acidjazz> Khudher: i doubt it no
[20:44:49] <Khudher> solice, Thank you!
[20:45:59] <taplar> >_<
[20:47:32] <taplar> self invoking function...
[20:48:11] <Khudher> taplar, yes lol
[20:48:34] <taplar> IIFE isn't self invoking
[20:52:42] <shoky_> close enough
