[01:50:11] <Vetaxili> Hi all. I'm using .one() to allow only a single click on a link. First click, all good, redirection is being processed, but the second click halts it. Any idea what I can do to make sure that the page gets redirected once only?
[01:50:46] <Cork> Vetaxili: by link you mean a <a> tag?
[01:51:09] <Vetaxili> Cork Yes.
[01:51:24] <Cork> and you want the default navigation action to happen the second time it is clicked?
[01:51:57] <Cork> (if no, then don't use a link)
[01:52:57] <Vetaxili> Cork, Only the first time. The link is actually responsible for cloning and order (not my code initially). So when it's clicked multiple times customers end up with more orders than they need. I somehow need to disable the ability to click on the link multiple times.
[01:53:17] <Cork> Vetaxili: use a <button type="button"></button> instead
[01:53:23] <Cork> and style it to look as you want
[01:53:35] <Cork> and possibly use disabled on the element instead of .one
[01:54:09] <Vetaxili> Cork, I'm not sure I will be able to. The link is within a drop down menu. Is it possible to use <button> within a list?
[01:54:23] <Cork> sure
[01:54:45] <Cork> only place you can't use it is in replaced elements
[01:54:55] <Cork> but you couldn't use <a> there either
[01:55:45] <Vetaxili> Cork, I will give that a go then. Thank you :-)
[01:55:51] <Cork> np
[01:56:38] <Cork> Vetaxili: the point of using <button disabled> is that you get a visible indicator that it isn't possible again

[03:05:01] <linuxson> Hey guys...quick question. I am busy with a HTML/Python/JQuery project, running it on a RaspBerryPI. My JQuery scripts are currently a bit of a mess, they're all over the place. Is it preferable to place the scripts in-line as you go? Is there a universal standard for placing scripts in an HTML document? Can I rather have the scripts separate and then "import" them as what you might do with
[03:05:01] <linuxson> libraries in Python?
[03:16:04] <Cork> linuxson: the standard is to separate styling, content and scripts
[03:16:20] <Cork> so you put the scripts in one/several scripts/group.js
[03:16:29] <Cork> and keep it completely outside the page
[03:16:32] <Cork> (and static)
[03:35:46] <linuxson> Cork: Ah, thank you
[07:44:59] <prillian5> why does the Line 95-112 works if I paste it in browser-console, but not in codepaste.io? http://codepen.io/suther/pen/GrpVmy

[09:20:50] <chrisml> anyone know how to insert a new table row with summernote?
[09:48:31] <ExeciN> I'm having a problem with .text it wipes everything on the same level instead of just changing the text. example: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0a82fe7c1fbec93a958018f9bae9a79d this makes my input go away.
[09:48:37] <ExeciN> how can I do it properly?
[10:00:40] <sdwrage> Hey all. Is there a way, with DataTables, to have two buttons to filter rows in the table by a certain columns piece of data. I have an "Activated" column with either true or false. I want to show all the true rows in the first activated filter button and deactivated rows when I click the other.
[10:05:52] <erry> Hi all
[10:06:05] <erry> is it ok to use jquery ui 1.12.1 with jquery 1.11
[10:06:37] <chasepeeler> I have a bunch of ajax calls that all need to complete before going on to the next step... instead of making them synchronous, or, getting into nested callback hell, the solution seems to be promises... I'm finding the documentation a bit confusing, so, I was hoping someone could just confirm this is the correct way to do it here: http://pastie.org/10989584
[10:09:09] <shoky> chasepeeler: almost.  it's  $.when.apply($, promises).done(.....
[10:10:04] <chasepeeler> Thanks... would you mind explaining why it needs to be done that way?
[10:10:35] <shoky> chasepeeler: because $.when only accepts separate arguments for each promise e.g.  $.when(promise1, promise2, promise3, ...)
[10:10:52] <shoky> chasepeeler: and .apply is a JS way to call a function like that, but with an array
[10:11:11] <shoky> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[10:12:21] <shoky> (the first parameter to .apply doesn't matter in the case of $.when)
[10:12:42] <chasepeeler> per http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/, you can pass in an array
[10:13:04] <shoky> chasepeeler: nope
[10:13:19] <erry> Any idea why $(element).tabs() would keep refreshing the page?
[10:13:20] <shoky> it says deferreds but doesn't say it's an array
[10:13:37] <shoky> and no examples show an array being passed
[10:13:44] <chasepeeler> ah
[10:13:45] <chasepeeler> okay
[10:13:48] <chasepeeler> you are correct
[10:14:11] <shoky> but they should really write a note about calling it with .apply  in that docs page
[10:17:00] <FilipNortic__> erry: the first guess would be some kind of wierd event listener
[10:17:13] <chasepeeler> and the original example I was going off of, also wasn't using an array... I really need to learn to read better :-)
[10:19:33] <chasepeeler> if I put a .done on the ajax call itself, is that guaranteed to get called before the .done called on the $.when?
[10:20:16] <aghalarp> Can anyone take a look at this? Hopefully simple problem... https://jsfiddle.net/94qfnqjd/
[10:21:19] <FilipNortic__> chasepeeler: In theory yes but i really wouldn't wanna bet on it
[10:21:43] <erry> let me try to make a basic page with only jquery
[10:22:45] <shoky> chasepeeler: what FilipNortic said, but i'd maybe use .then() in that case, which returns a new promise. e.g  var promise = $.ajax(..).then(function(response) { ... return new_result_value });
[10:23:13] <shoky> chasepeeler:  where new_result_value is either just `response` or a different value if you want
[10:24:59] <aghalarp> With a little additional info now: https://jsfiddle.net/94qfnqjd/1/
[10:25:39] <FilipNortic__> aghalarp: where does it say addClass takes a second arument?
[10:25:47] <FilipNortic__> argument?
[10:26:02] <shoky> chasepeeler: btw about which .done gets called first,  you're guaranteed that the .done you attach on the ajax call will run first, only if you attached that .done before calling $.when
[10:26:04] <aghalarp> jquery-ui extends it to allow that
[10:26:53] <shoky> chasepeeler: but it wouldn't be the case if you did e.g.:   var promise = $.ajax(..);   $.when(promise).done(...);    promise.done(...);
[10:27:06] <shoky> chasepeeler: but i guess that's pretty obvious when spelled out like that
[10:27:26] <chasepeeler> http://pastie.org/10989587 there is a simplified example of what I'm trying to do....
[10:27:43] <chasepeeler> do you still suggest moving the callback from the ajax call into a "then" call?
[10:27:51] <shoky> can you use another paste site? i cant reach that one 90% of the time
[10:28:05] <shoky> not sure if it's just me..
[10:28:31] <shoky> (my goto is http://hastebin.com )
[10:29:19] <chasepeeler> https://hastebin.com/wehujisugu.js
[10:29:40] <FilipNortic__> aghalarp: well it doent seam to be the ui version that get used there
[10:31:04] <aghalarp> How can you tell? Just because its not animating? Or because you can see its calling the regular jQuery version
[10:31:48] <FilipNortic__> aghalarp: checked in the debugger but i might have looked at the wrong thing
[10:32:11] <shoky> chasepeeler: that's fine like it is, i suppose. though not really sure why you're using that cache object
[10:33:00] <aghalarp> Hm... really odd
[10:34:11] <FilipNortic__> aghalarp: yes it was my check that was wrong it has the animate option
[10:34:45] <chasepeeler> preloading data.... final question, and this isn't a huge deal, so I don't really need it... but, if I wanted to check to make sure it wasn't ALREADY cached in my load method, would there be a way to return a resolved promise without doing the ajax call? https://hastebin.com/jozolequmu.js
[10:35:29] <aghalarp> I'm out of ideas, seems like it really should work but it doesn't
[10:37:16] <shoky> chasepeeler: you can just do  return;
[10:37:47] <chasepeeler> so, a non-promise passed into when will just get ignored?
[10:37:53] <shoky> chasepeeler: $.when accepts non-promises too
[10:38:22] <shoky> chasepeeler: not ignored per-se, but treated as a resolved promise with that resolve value
[10:39:58] <FilipNortic__> aghalarp: https://jsfiddle.net/94qfnqjd/2/
[10:40:15] <FilipNortic__> most be something in bootstrap that messes it up
[10:40:37] <FilipNortic__> must*
[10:41:18] <aghalarp> that's interesting
[10:41:36] <aghalarp> yeah i agree, just some weird incompatability with bootstrap
[10:43:03] <shoky> aghalarp: it's because the background color is not added to the <tr> element
[10:43:22] <shoky> (with bootstrap)
[10:44:15] <aghalarp> but its changing color
[10:44:36] <shoky> aghalarp: the background color is added to the <td>
[10:45:21] <aghalarp> oh... that's weird
[10:45:38] <shoky> it's not ;]
[10:49:45] <aghalarp> should it not be added to the tr?
[10:58:49] <shoky> aghalarp that's not what bootstrap's css does. it adds it to the td
[10:59:11] <shoky> which is more proper anyway i think
[11:00:12] <aghalarp> Ah okay
[11:00:16] <MassDebates> Yes
[11:00:23] <MassDebates> Adding backgrounds to TRs is a surefire way to lose hair
[11:00:28] <MassDebates> Almost instantly.
[11:00:32] <MassDebates> I tried it.
[11:00:36] * MassDebates feels bald spot on head
[11:00:56] <aghalarp> So er... do you know why its not animating?
[11:09:21] <shoky> because jqui only knows to animate it if its happening on the same elemnt the class was added on , apparently
[11:10:22] <shoky> aghalarp: just use css transitions
[11:10:48] <MassDebates> Easy peasy, Japaneasy
[11:10:49] <shoky> doing transition animations with jq/jqui is hardly ever a great idea ;p
[11:11:00] <MassDebates> Class swaps are great to drive css transitions.
[11:12:07] <aghalarp> Hm, I should take a look at that
[11:12:21] <aghalarp> by the way, I did fix it thanks for your help
[11:12:56] <aghalarp> basically what you said: don't do background-color on tr
[11:13:17] <aghalarp> so instead if i select all child td's of the tr i want to animate, it works then
[11:13:42] <MassDebates> No I didn't.
[11:13:51] <MassDebates> I just said it's the fast track to baldness.
[11:14:03] <MassDebates> Very useful for the monks studying martial arts.

[12:26:04] <laravelnewbie> hi
[12:26:14] <laravelnewbie> I'm getting some problems with jsGrid
[12:26:20] <laravelnewbie> is anyone here using it?
[12:26:47] <minikN> Hello, I'm using this (https://jsfiddle.net/rzmqr95w/) jQuery script. It's quite long but I have a simple question. I need an AJAX request somewhere in this file. But instead of harcoding it in, can I exclude it in another file and wrap it inside a function that accepts params? So that in the script, for example inside the onNext function (line 406-441) I can call it like request = ajaxrequest(inputarray); or something like
[12:26:47] <minikN>  that, is that possible?
[12:31:54] <ExeciN> is there an elegant way to get the element right after $("#whatever"); ?
[12:33:04] <Uhkis> next()
[12:33:43] <ExeciN> doesn't it need a selector?
[12:33:46] <duch_kazatel> newp.
[12:33:50] <ExeciN> ah cool
[12:34:14] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/next/ -> "If a selector is provided, [...]"
[12:34:34] <duch_kazatel> also in the api docs, if an arg is surrounded with square brackets that means it's optional.
[12:55:29] <qakhan> hi all. is it possible that 2 different elements can do same action.
[12:55:39] <duch_kazatel> for anm event handler you mean?
[12:56:21] <qakhan> like in my current code https://fiddle.jshell.net/1mfgny9j/57/     there is button "Create Group" when i click this button it creates a table
[12:57:06] <duch_kazatel> did you want another button to do the same thing?
[12:57:31] <qakhan> there is input field. i want to type text and hit enter. when enter key pressed then do the same action as "Create Group" button does. create table
[12:57:48] <duch_kazatel> sure, you can do that.
[12:57:54] <qakhan> duch_kazatel yes. hit enter on input field
[12:58:01] <duch_kazatel> yeah.  easy
[12:58:13] <qakhan> use same code?
[12:58:17] <qakhan> of button
[12:58:28] <duch_kazatel> don't just copy/paste it.
[12:58:36] <duch_kazatel> and it'll require a little extra working.
[12:59:22] <duch_kazatel> why are you using firebug lite btw?
[13:00:05] <duch_kazatel> ... also why did you change the fix i gave you the other day for tooltips?
[13:00:13] <qakhan> i am not using it, it was old from someone else
[13:00:15] <qakhan> i did
[13:00:19] <Uhkis> chrome doesn't have full firebug =(
[13:00:29] <duch_kazatel> errr,,,/
[13:00:32] <duch_kazatel> *errr.
[13:00:38] <duch_kazatel> chrome has its own tools that are better heh.
[13:00:44] <duch_kazatel> qakhan you can remove that, but OK.
[13:00:59] <Uhkis> they most certainly are not :D
[13:01:00] <duch_kazatel> either way, some simple abstraction is all you need
[13:01:06] <duch_kazatel> wat
[13:01:38] <qakhan> duch_kazatel so i have to write same $('#allgroupsdiv').append() etc................ under input field enter key?
[13:01:45] <duch_kazatel> ....
[13:01:46] <duch_kazatel> no.
[13:01:50] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[13:03:08] <duch_kazatel> qakhan https://jsfiddle.net/w7LfLhpu/
[13:03:19] <duch_kazatel> abstract out the handler.
[13:03:31] <duch_kazatel> and then call that function where you need it.
[13:09:49] <qakhan> Great thanks duch_kazatel
[13:09:57] <duch_kazatel> make sense?
[13:10:06] <qakhan> yes, i got it

[14:14:31] <OnTheRocks> i was running that on a local directory
[14:14:43] <duch_kazatel> what was the error?

[14:15:06] <duch_kazatel> that's why.
[14:15:10] <OnTheRocks> and i was getying that error
[14:15:28] <OnTheRocks> what that means?

[15:14:48] <Ziberius> hello
[15:15:37] <Ziberius> i have some divs that I'm adding dynamically to my page and on these divs i have some classes that I point to with a $(".class").on('click',function(){ do something });
[15:15:57] <Ziberius> problem is when adding this dynamically the on click is not triggerred
[15:16:03] <Ziberius> any ideas how to solve this?
[15:16:47] <duch_kazatel> you need a delegated handler.
[15:16:54] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[15:16:59] <duch_kazatel> err, listener.
[15:19:52] <duch_kazatel> Ziberius make sense?
[15:20:43] <Ziberius> duch_kazatel, thanx i'll check it out
[15:24:48] <Ziberius> duch_kazatel, I think I get it, so instead of pointing directly to the nonexistan class that is added dynamically i point to some class that exits and an <a> inside that for example
[15:25:43] <duch_kazatel> basically.  make sure the parent element isn't the whole page but is, say, the element you're appending stuff to.
[15:26:01] <duch_kazatel> bonus points for actually reading that btw.  most people skip to the examples and get it wrong hahaha
[15:26:12] <Ziberius> duch_kazatel, yes exactly great thanx I'll test it
[15:28:58] <External> Is someone here able to help me with jquery
[15:29:10] <MikeD_> how would we know?
[15:29:15] <duch_kazatel> if you have a question, just ask.  if somebody can help, they will :)
[15:30:23] <External> Im trying to differentiate between multiple of the same class names, is there a way to put them in a list and then select the first one? They dont have ids on them so i dont know of another way
[15:30:38] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[15:30:41] <duch_kazatel> clarify?
[15:30:47] <duch_kazatel> like - have a jsfiddle?
[15:31:36] <External> what? sorry I dont understand what you mean
[15:31:51] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/
[15:31:58] <duch_kazatel> it lets you make a test case.
[15:32:08] <duch_kazatel> so we can see what you're talking about.
[15:33:08] <External> I dont have any code currently, im trying to find a way to do this atm.
[15:33:18] <duch_kazatel> you have some html, right?
[15:33:26] <duch_kazatel> even that would be helpful here.
[15:34:14] <duch_kazatel> because the way your question reads, it sounds like you're saying you have something like https://jsfiddle.net/v748n0ao/
[15:34:23] <External> Im editing the existing html of a website, its for a chrome extention
[15:34:23] <duch_kazatel> and you just want the first one out of those, right?
[15:35:18] <External> I will grab some code, from the website, give me a sec
[15:35:18] <duch_kazatel> 'kay.  this is why test cases are helpful :) abstracts the specifics away and focuses on the problem.
[15:36:05] <External> Nm, i see what you did, thats pretty much what I want to do
[15:36:35] <duch_kazatel> right.  so you have multiple elements with the same class, right?
[15:36:50] <duch_kazatel> and you just wantt the first.  you could try... .first() ;)
[15:40:27] <duch_kazatel> External make sense?
[15:41:54] <External> I will research first and see if I can get it myself
[15:41:55] <External> thanks
[15:44:47] <GeekMonkey> Hey all
[15:45:16] <GeekMonkey> I am looking for a jquery exit intent function with cookies... I do not want it to open a modal but just to run a function
[15:56:50] <duch_kazatel> GeekMonkey decent amount of options out there.  no need for jquery on something like that though, is there?
[16:39:50] <duch_kazatel> weeeeeeee
[16:40:56] <GeekMonkey> duch_kazatel no don't need to use Jquery
[16:41:01] <GeekMonkey> could use straight js
[16:41:17] <GeekMonkey> have you seen any good options with cookie creation?
[16:41:55] <duch_kazatel> i avoid stuff like that as much as possible.  what're you trying to accomplish?
[16:43:50] <duch_kazatel> like - what do you want to do when the user shows intent to leave?
[16:58:55] <duch_kazatel> (shrug)
[16:58:57] <duch_kazatel> welp
[17:01:36] <GeekMonkey> duch_kazatel it is to show a promo that the company is having with a 30 day cache... so it only shows once
[17:01:59] <duch_kazatel> you could use pretty much intent plugin and then manage cookies yourself.
[17:02:48] <GeekMonkey> do you mean "pretty much ANY intent plugin"?
[17:02:54] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[17:03:17] <GeekMonkey> What I found is most intent have a popup already built in
[17:03:28] <GeekMonkey> and I do not want to use there built in popup
[17:03:52] <duch_kazatel> using bootstrap or anything?
[17:04:25] <duch_kazatel> and also: http://beeker.io/exit-intent-popup-script-tutorial
[17:04:26] <GeekMonkey> I am using wp.... but a custom theme.... and I am already using popup form
[17:04:37] <duch_kazatel> no clue if it's usful buuut here's a choice.
[17:04:51] <GeekMonkey> that is why I do not want to use an exit intent popup so my styling matches
[17:04:58] <duch_kazatel> that's fine.
[17:05:26] <duch_kazatel> though you COULD style pretty much anything to match or whatever but that;'s a totally fair issue.
[17:06:34] <GeekMonkey> Actually that is fairly basic... that might work
[17:06:56] <GeekMonkey> I wonder if you can do shortcodes inside that html field
[17:07:03] <duch_kazatel> "shortcodes"?
[17:10:56] <MassDebates> shortcodes are likely referenced wp mechanism for utilizing plugins and other cues
[17:10:57] <GeekMonkey> yes shortcodes
[17:11:13] <GeekMonkey> for example I use gravity forms
[17:11:16] <duch_kazatel> ah, what MassDebates sait?
[17:11:22] <MassDebates> ?
[17:11:23] <MassDebates> sait?
[17:11:24] <duch_kazatel> (i don't use WP or PHP)
[17:11:27] <duch_kazatel> *said
[17:11:29] <duch_kazatel> typo
[17:11:31] <MassDebates> Time for the oracle known as goo
[17:11:32] <MassDebates> nvm
[17:11:36] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[17:12:09] <duch_kazatel> either way - GeekMonkey i'd render the html out to the page somewhere and then puill it in.
[17:12:11] <MassDebates> GeekMonkey:  Shortcodes are different. They're a processed setup that is usually handled before jquery (or similar) really touches it.
[17:12:17] <duch_kazatel> ^
[17:12:21] <MassDebates> Think of it like php, almost.
[17:12:23] <MassDebates> ... almost.
[17:12:34] <duch_kazatel> your php shouldn't be processing .js files.
[17:12:43] <duch_kazatel> but you can pumnp out to the page and select it and go from there.
[17:12:55] <MassDebates> my php processes anything i want because my php can beat up your php
[17:13:01] <MassDebates> like my dad can beat up your dad.
[17:13:05] <duch_kazatel> welp
[17:13:24] * MassDebates feeds his php the blood of a viper once a morning
[17:13:29] <duch_kazatel> 'kay.
[17:13:30] <MassDebates> lol, i'll stop
[17:13:53] <MassDebates> GeekMonkey:  I think duch's proposal is the best way to go here.
[17:14:13] <MassDebates> GeekMonkey:  there's nothing that stops jquery from interfacing with the content thereafter. Some careful planning on what's going to be worked with might be necessary, but that's with all things
[17:14:42] <MassDebates> GeekMonkey:  #wordpress can help you deal with the shortcodes end of it - #jquery guys here will love to help you with post-game.
[17:16:08] <GeekMonkey> MassDebates it is PHP... since php is processing and creating it
[17:16:19] <duch_kazatel> php shouldn't be processing your js.
[17:16:21] <duch_kazatel> like, ever
[17:16:24] <GeekMonkey> no
[17:16:40] <duch_kazatel> that's what he was trying to say.
[17:16:49] <MassDebates> ahahaha sorry if I messed up that
[17:17:43] <GeekMonkey> I don't mind that beeker.io
[17:18:08] <GeekMonkey> but it would be nicer that instead of have it show some html it just ran a js function
[17:19:45] <GeekMonkey> Think I found it
[17:19:47] <GeekMonkey> https://www.npmjs.com/package/Exitent
[17:19:57] <MassDebates> that not equal
[17:20:02] <MassDebates> er
[17:20:06] <MassDebates> that not same
[17:20:48] <duch_kazatel> that beeker script is something you could modify fwiw.
[17:20:55] <GeekMonkey> fwiw?
[17:21:02] <duch_kazatel> for what it's worth.
[17:21:07] <duch_kazatel> but that option via npm works as well.
[17:21:25] <GeekMonkey> The npm allows me to call a function
[17:21:42] <duch_kazatel> sure - you coulda changeed the other one to do the same (shrug).
[17:21:46] <duch_kazatel> whatever works though.
[17:21:48] <GeekMonkey> in this case I can use magnific popup (which I am already using for pre-existing forms)
[17:22:09] <duch_kazatel> heh you've made that requirement clear ;)
[17:22:13] <MassDebates> Yes but that isnt same as previous proposed jquery being processed by php
[17:22:28] <duch_kazatel> we were saying you shouldn't do that.
[17:22:36] <duch_kazatel> nor would you need to.
[17:22:36] <MassDebates> yes
[17:22:39] <MassDebates> yes
[17:22:47] <GeekMonkey> Let me lay it out... I think you will see what I am doing
[17:22:58] <duch_kazatel> i understand exactly what you're doing.
[17:23:03] <MassDebates> I see now what you are doing
[17:23:10] <duch_kazatel> i dunno why you're acting like i wouldn't heh
[17:23:12] <GeekMonkey> I using php to create the Gravity Form That is hidden via magnific popup css
[17:23:17] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[17:23:22] <duch_kazatel> this is relatively common stuff.
[17:23:25] <MassDebates> yes
[17:23:31] <MassDebates> hi taplar
[17:23:37] <taplar> sup
[17:23:41] <MassDebates> guess what i am playing with
[17:23:43] <duch_kazatel> hey buddy
[17:23:50] <GeekMonkey> I use npm to detect for exit intent and call the magnific popup function to popup my form... and all form styling is the same woot woot
[17:23:50] <taplar> hmm
[17:23:59] <duch_kazatel> that's fine.
[17:24:00] <MassDebates> working on thingy that selectively prints certain parts of page for you!
[17:24:11] <MassDebates> er not you specially
[17:24:11] <taplar> for me?
[17:24:16] <MassDebates> knew it
[17:24:19] <GeekMonkey> MassDebates "guess what I am playing with" there could be kids on this channel
[17:24:19] <taplar> D:
[17:24:20] <MassDebates> knew you were going say that
[17:24:20] <GeekMonkey> argh
[17:24:30] <MassDebates> ah ah ah
[17:26:22] <MassDebates> Ugh, this translation thing doesn't work
[17:26:28] <MassDebates> I have to type shit out still.
[17:26:55] <MassDebates> At any rate, I think you should check it out when its done taplar - I'd love to have you look over it and tell me what should be cleaned up for standards
[17:27:15] <taplar> what language are we talking about?
[17:27:17] <MassDebates> jquery
[17:27:19] <MassDebates> er
[17:27:20] <MassDebates> No sorry
[17:27:23] <MassDebates> I KNOW ITS NOT JQ
[17:27:25] <MassDebates> I meant javascript
[17:27:34] <MassDebates> But it's using the jquery library
[17:27:49] <taplar> k.  dunno that i can tell you 'standards' but i can look over it, sure
[17:27:57] <duch_kazatel> heh
[17:28:14] <MassDebates> Okay, I meant like if its bad in the same sense of .attr vs .data
[17:28:32] <duch_kazatel> that's easy stuff to know fwiw.
[17:28:32] <MassDebates> best practice is better?
[17:28:53] <GeekMonkey> MassDebates are you trying to print just content within an element
[17:30:40] <duch_kazatel> #crickets
[17:30:42] <MassDebates> I wanted to work with manipulating selections in javascript
[17:31:21] <MassDebates> It's going into a piece that i wanted to make a bit more robust - there's sales guys in various territories that handle machine tool sales for a manufacturer
[17:31:38] <MassDebates> however they talk to lots of ... *gasp* OLD PEOPLE *end gasp* and these people don't like using digital stuff
[17:31:51] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1071962/how-do-i-print-part-of-a-rendered-html-page-in-javascript  <-- this is pretty interesting.  it moves the part to print to an iframe and prints the iframe
[17:32:14] <MassDebates> but the guys that manage these sales dudes don't like using forms because of the costs with printing.
[17:32:27] <MassDebates> Apparently carbon copy paper is ridiculously expensive or something
[17:32:36] <taplar> i can imagine
[17:32:39] <MassDebates> So they want to carry around ipads or whatever and print from there.
[17:32:43] <MassDebates> Wth?! it's just paper
[17:32:50] <taplar> it's heat sensative paper
[17:32:54] <taplar> sensitive
[17:33:06] <MassDebates> Well
[17:33:07] <duch_kazatel> https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008K5ENE6/ref=s9_acsd_top_hd_bw_bXD5dL_c_x_1_w?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-4&pf_rd_r=0Z6Y85HZ75RF47N21S4J&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=05b2e8f7-d232-5294-bee6-9980a2e82d47&pf_rd_i=490739011
[17:33:10] <MassDebates> Maybe you should toughen your paper up a bit
[17:33:12] <duch_kazatel> at scale that gets pricey
[17:33:25] <MassDebates> LOL $5
[17:33:25] <taplar> not only is there most likely more cost in making it, but there is probably added cost in transporting and storing it
[17:33:29] <MassDebates> That's SO MUCH
[17:33:40] <duch_kazatel> MassDebates that 22 cents a page.
[17:33:48] <duch_kazatel> factor in waste and shit.
[17:33:48] <MassDebates> Dear god
[17:33:53] <duch_kazatel> that gets really expensive at scale.
[17:34:09] <MassDebates> Oh uh dont take my msgs as sarcasm
[17:34:17] <MassDebates> I probably should've just googled the price
[17:34:22] <duch_kazatel> i do, actually.
[17:34:27] <duch_kazatel> but i'm refuting it.
[17:34:33] <duch_kazatel> that really is expensive at scale.
[17:34:39] <MassDebates> okay, cool, because I wasn't being sarcastic
[17:34:45] <MassDebates> I had no idea it was that expensive until amazon link
[17:34:55] <duch_kazatel> 'kay.
[17:35:06] <duch_kazatel> either way, why is printing part of a page a solution here?
[17:35:57] <MassDebates> It allows the sales guy to do the print at the customer's office, using customer's paper and cost and allows us to intake data digitally from customers that otherwise wouldn't do it on their own.
[17:36:00] <taplar> lol, it just struck me.  that's kinda a weird concept.  printing a carbon copy
[17:36:06] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[17:36:12] <MassDebates> It's a justification thing
[17:36:16] <duch_kazatel> MassDebates you're making a few assumptions there.
[17:36:47] <duch_kazatel> the biggest of which is that they'll be able to connect to the customer's printer.
[17:36:57] <duch_kazatel> also: i still don't see why they need to be able to print part of a page.
[17:37:07] <MassDebates> So they have a copy while we walk away with the digital copy.
[17:37:18] <taplar> i'd think you'd instead generate a pdf of the PO and email it
[17:37:20] <MassDebates> 2 copies are printed, one is 'printed' (saved) to pdf
[17:37:25] <duch_kazatel> back up
[17:37:30] <duch_kazatel> why part of a page.
[17:37:31] <MassDebates> But sometimes people want a copy right away - this is more important for something like a 5 axis machine
[17:37:34] <duch_kazatel> why not an entire page?
[17:37:46] <MassDebates> The amount of options on a machine is unreal
[17:37:57] <MassDebates> Not all of the form is applicable and would cause contractual issues with vendors if it was included
[17:38:14] <MassDebates> unreal?
[17:38:21] <duch_kazatel> so then really you just need to generate a customer copy.
[17:38:50] <MassDebates> Yes, and they want to be prepared to give it to them any way.
[17:38:53] <duch_kazatel> grab input names + values, shunt to backend service, create documents, make available.,
[17:39:09] <MassDebates> Can't find shunt
[17:39:13] <duch_kazatel> send
[17:39:29] <MassDebates> Not always available.
[17:39:34] <duch_kazatel> erm.
[17:39:43] <duch_kazatel> but they can always connect to a customer's printer?
[17:39:47] <taplar> so the tablet they are carrying around may not be on network
[17:39:48] <MassDebates> Not always either.
[17:39:54] <duch_kazatel> i feel like this is awfully short sighted heh
[17:39:59] <MassDebates> That's why every option should be available.
[17:40:05] <MassDebates> Give you 2 examples:
[17:40:24] <duch_kazatel> i understand the premise here.
[17:40:27] <MassDebates> oh okay
[17:40:27] <duch_kazatel> that's not the issue.
[17:40:38] <duch_kazatel> i'm saying that it makes some really bad assumptions.
[17:41:01] <MassDebates> Hit me with them
[17:41:13] <duch_kazatel> you assume they can connect to the customer's printer
[17:41:23] <duch_kazatel> "print part of a page" is a really slow, awkward process.
[17:41:52] <MassDebates> There is no assumption - this is a coverall solution to prepare in any event.
[17:41:59] <duch_kazatel> ..
[17:42:10] <taplar> what happens if they can't connect to the printer?
[17:42:11] <duch_kazatel> you should assume they CAN'T print from a customer printer.
[17:42:24] <MassDebates> RIght, which is why it saves a copy on the device
[17:42:30] <MassDebates> Saves a PDF via print
[17:42:31] <duch_kazatel> i know at my work, there's NO WAY we'd let people use our printers because it'd require access to our network
[17:42:36] <duch_kazatel> just save pdf and email that.
[17:42:43] <duch_kazatel> if they want a paper copy, mail it.
[17:42:54] <duch_kazatel> skip this customer site printing business.
[17:43:00] <MassDebates> Can't do.
[17:43:01] <duch_kazatel> or look into getting portable printers for the sales reps.
[17:43:17] <taplar> that would probably be the easiest route
[17:43:20] <duch_kazatel> ^^^
[17:43:39] <duch_kazatel> because all this stuff about assumping you can print using the customer's equipment is... bad.
[17:43:50] <MassDebates> It's not a requirement, it's an option.
[17:43:54] <duch_kazatel> it's a bad one.
[17:43:56] <duch_kazatel> (shrug)
[17:43:59] <MassDebates> Some customers want a hard copy immediately, some don't.
[17:44:03] <duch_kazatel> you're creating an IT nightmare.
[17:44:20] <duch_kazatel> imagine the myriad drivers folks with end up installing over time.
[17:44:26] <duch_kazatel> the antiquated machines.
[17:44:27] <taplar> if they want a hard copy immediately and you can't connect to their printer, what do you do?
[17:44:34] <duch_kazatel> ^^^
[17:44:35] <duch_kazatel> heh
[17:44:42] <MassDebates> That's when we use the oldschool form.
[17:44:44] <duch_kazatel> in the VERY LIKELY EVENT they can't connect.
[17:44:50] <MassDebates> ?
[17:44:55] <MassDebates> These aren't developer offices lmao
[17:44:58] <MassDebates> These are machinist offices.
[17:45:18] <taplar> ok, so if a printer is available, it will print.  otherwise they will fill a hard copy out manually
[17:45:22] <duch_kazatel> so your sales rep is comfortable unplugging the printer from the customer's computer?
[17:45:26] <MassDebates> Exactly taplar
[17:45:37] <duch_kazatel> that seems like a super bizarrre interaction.
[17:45:38] <taplar> :/
[17:45:49] <MassDebates> They wanted costs significantly reduced
[17:45:51] <MassDebates> So far we're like
[17:45:53] <MassDebates> 80% paperless now
[17:45:54] <duch_kazatel> like - i'd find that almost unprofessional and kind of unprepared.
[17:46:01] <taplar> do you think the sales people will feel it worth their while to go through the trouble of figuring out the whole printer bit?
[17:46:04] <duch_kazatel> but there's a part you can't make paperless.
[17:46:13] <MassDebates> From what I've been told, here's how the interaction goes.
[17:46:28] <duch_kazatel> and you're going to make the sales rep take tons of extra time to install printer drivers and stuff.
[17:46:38] <taplar> lol, didn't even think of htat
[17:46:48] <duch_kazatel> the amount of time that takes from a manpower standpoint is crazy expensive.
[17:46:58] <duch_kazatel> you're trading one cost for another, more expensive one.
[17:47:04] <MassDebates> We've not had that reported back yet.
[17:47:16] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:47:30] <MassDebates> Anyways, the thing I'm working on now is to selectively print a page because I want to practice on jquery
[17:47:33] <MassDebates> and the selection stuff
[17:47:33] <taplar> let me ask you thing.  on average, filling out the physical hard copy.  how long does that take?
[17:47:55] <MassDebates> I don't know an average, I'm never there. I'm not a part of their business
[17:48:08] <MassDebates> But I'm told it takes a couple hours?
[17:48:15] <duch_kazatel> i just know if i had a sales rep ask for the usb cable to my printer or network access so they could print something i'd be way weirded out.
[17:48:17] <MassDebates> The digital form is much faster for whatever reason
[17:48:28] <MassDebates> I was worried it'd take LONGER! That was my biggest issue - form stopping from screen, etc.
[17:48:42] <taplar> yeah, we'd probably just tell them to email us a copy
[17:48:48] <duch_kazatel> ^^
[17:48:58] <taplar> email it to our xerox.  it can print that shit auto
[17:49:10] <duch_kazatel> or email it to the customer and they can print or w/e
[17:49:16] <MassDebates> Not every customer wants to be emailed a copy. From what I understand, every customer that has wanted an immediate copy wasn't happy with email but was happy with sales rep connecting to wifi and printing.
[17:49:27] <duch_kazatel> but that hardcopy thing is batty.
[17:49:28] <MassDebates> SO far, every customer with immediate print (quite a few) have had success with wifi connection and print.
[17:49:45] <duch_kazatel> just making a ton of assumptions about setups but (shrug)
[17:49:55] <MassDebates> I told them to test the print first, but I'm not sure if they actually do.
[17:50:11] <MassDebates> But they haven't had a hitch so..... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[17:50:14] <taplar> ok, so lets go back to the partial thing.  you said you need the partial because parts of the thing don't apply right?
[17:50:23] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:50:30] <MassDebates> That's really just practice.
[17:50:40] <MassDebates> I'm using the project (now complete) for a side practice experiment
[17:50:41] <dglambert> night
[17:50:52] <MassDebates> I might bring it to them later but they're not asking for it
[17:50:58] <taplar> wait, wha?
[17:51:15] <MassDebates> I'm practicing jquery selection manipulation (highlighting with a mouse on a web browser)
[17:51:43] <MassDebates> THey have a form right now but it's just only the SOC - doesn't cover machine quote details in full - that's going to be only hard copy for quite some time.
[17:51:43] <taplar> but is that accurate?  the partial question i asked
[17:52:15] <MassDebates> yeah in my practice. I'm trying to do the machine quote details form as a supplemental experiment to see fi i can
[17:52:48] <taplar> so would it not make more sense to provide those areas that might not apply with a "does not apply" option which simply hides them so they won't print?
[17:53:33] <MassDebates> Yeah, which can be done in CSS but that won't help me practice jquery if I use CSS
[17:53:50] <taplar> you don't need a blender to cook eggs man
[17:53:52] <duch_kazatel> heh
[17:53:53] <duch_kazatel> ^^^^
[17:54:10] <duch_kazatel> knowing when NOT to use a tool helps you "practice" it.
[17:55:10] <MassDebates> If you want to learn how to grill chicken for a caesar salad, throwing just the salad in the bowl and microwaving grilled chicken for caesar salads doesn't teach you how to better grill said chicken for said salad.
[17:55:48] <taplar> your analogy works in my favor
[17:56:06] <MassDebates> I don't have many jquery projects but i wanted to practice with something a bit 'heavier' so I used a lot of the code from before and spun it in terms that i know
[17:56:21] <MassDebates> it interested me because i already used jquery on it
[17:56:28] <duch_kazatel> don't use tools wrong.
[17:56:29] <duch_kazatel> (shrug)
[17:56:40] <duch_kazatel> don't apply jquery when css is the better tool.
[17:56:51] <MassDebates> I agree for production
[17:56:56] <duch_kazatel> for learning.
[17:56:58] <duch_kazatel> for anything.
[17:57:09] <duch_kazatel> unless your goal is "how can i make this even harder for myself?"
[17:57:19] <MassDebates> You never practice a game with a handicap?
[17:57:30] <duch_kazatel> that's... not a handicap.
[17:57:36] <MassDebates> lol
[17:57:38] <duch_kazatel> that's like using a saw as a hammer.
[17:57:55] <MassDebates> I think you'd get pretty good at using a saw as a hammer if you did.
[17:58:06] <taplar> why is that a skill you need though?
[17:58:10] <duch_kazatel> ^
[17:58:15] <MassDebates> But understanding that you're still using a saw as a hammer (as opposed to correctly doing it - using a hammer as a hammer) will avoid the problems you guys are worried about.
[17:58:18] <taplar> i'd rather you be damn good at a hammer
[17:58:45] <MassDebates> Why is using pure CSS solutions (when not applicably necessary) worth extra brownie points?
[17:58:46] <duch_kazatel> taplar and i both have a lot of experience here - we want to see people succeed.  trust us.
[17:59:02] <MassDebates> When is it ever a skill?
[17:59:02] <MassDebates> It's not.
[17:59:02] <MassDebates> Using the appropriate things is a great skill.
[17:59:12] <MassDebates> But I know I got way better at CSS when learning how to do bullshit.
[17:59:30] <MassDebates> I learned sass by triyng to do mixins and learning what the ropes were.
[17:59:32] <duch_kazatel> you're conflating "day to day" with "bad things:"
[17:59:53] <taplar> the skill is applying the right tool for the right problem, to decrease work.  work being any form of time spent on it
[18:00:05] <duch_kazatel> and it's all about the right tool for the job.  being able to say "oh this is a display concern" simplifies and clarifies what your code is doing.
[18:00:17] <taplar> time making it, time maintaining it, ...
[18:00:22] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[18:00:26] <taplar> time getting others up to speed on it
[18:00:30] <MassDebates> That's great and all
[18:00:36] <MassDebates> But at the end of the day
[18:00:44] <duch_kazatel> you also end up learning a much better way to use those tools.
[18:00:51] <duch_kazatel> insteadof dicking around with misapplying things.
[18:01:22] <duch_kazatel> i'm all for doing things for the lols, but learning to use those tools is a different beast.
[18:01:28] <MassDebates> I found the practice to be fun, insightful and educational. The things I get from 'dicking around' with this stuff is transversible, even when I'm appropriately doing things.
[18:01:42] <duch_kazatel> lol
[18:01:47] <duch_kazatel> whatevs mang.
[18:01:49] <MassDebates> If you ask me to do something that involves the code that I wrote, I would do it to your satisfaction
[18:01:56] <taplar> did you not say though that you might offer it to them after you make it?
[18:02:08] <duch_kazatel> 9/10 nobody else is going to ask you questions about your code.
[18:02:10] <MassDebates> Yes. Do you ever offer an incomplete product?
[18:02:16] <taplar> nope
[18:02:21] <MassDebates> Neither do i.
[18:02:21] <taplar> i'm forced to
[18:02:23] <duch_kazatel> ...
[18:02:27] <taplar> heh
[18:02:29] <duch_kazatel> he was asked if you were going to.
[18:02:34] <duch_kazatel> not if you'd do it when incomplete.
[18:02:37] <duch_kazatel> like.. contextually.
[18:02:48] <duch_kazatel> he wasn't implying you'd offer an incomplete product.  bad emphasis there ;)
[18:02:51] <MassDebates> Even when I'm finished with the working example, it won't be a complete product.
[18:03:00] <MassDebates> I would do it the right way because that'd be production.
[18:03:05] <duch_kazatel> lol
[18:03:15] <duch_kazatel> your prototypes should still follow good practices.
[18:03:20] <duch_kazatel> but what would i know baout that.
[18:03:25] <MassDebates> I wouldn't use jquery at all tbh
[18:03:25] <MassDebates> Or CSS
[18:03:25] <MassDebates> or a webform.
[18:03:25] <taplar> so.... they see the new shiny
[18:03:25] <taplar> they like the shiny
[18:03:34] <MassDebates> No, they don't see the new shiny.
[18:03:35] <taplar> and then your going to tell them... well, it's going to take a bit to make it right
[18:03:39] <MassDebates> No
[18:03:41] <MassDebates> Not at all.
[18:03:45] <taplar> ?
[18:03:52] <MassDebates> they don't see it.
[18:03:55] <duch_kazatel> wut
[18:04:06] <duch_kazatel> so you're going to build it twice no matter what?
[18:04:10] <taplar> how can you offer it to them with out showing it to them?
[18:04:13] <duch_kazatel> ^^^^^
[18:04:43] <MassDebates> yes duch
[18:04:51] <duch_kazatel> uh
[18:05:05] <duch_kazatel> welp
[18:05:21] <MassDebates> lol, don't worry about it guys
[18:05:25] <MassDebates> I've been in biz for over 10 yrs
[18:05:31] <MassDebates> Things are going to stay that way.
[18:05:34] <duch_kazatel> aaaand there it is.
[18:05:41] <MassDebates> Never had unhappiness.
[18:05:47] <MassDebates> The developers never complain about past work
[18:05:59] <MassDebates> Literally, never had a bad relationship.
[18:06:26] <duch_kazatel> then why waste time talking with us?
[18:06:44] <taplar> it's interesting how some times managers may not know how their developers truly feel
[18:06:50] <duch_kazatel> ^^
[18:07:31] <MassDebates> So I'm wasting time talking to you guys if I don't take the business process advice?
[18:07:37] <MassDebates> I can't ask about jquery specifically?
[18:07:42] <duch_kazatel> holy shit.
[18:07:49] <duch_kazatel> literally nobody said either of those things.
[18:07:51] <duch_kazatel> lol
[18:07:58] <taplar> i didn't think we were talking about jquery here
[18:08:22] <MassDebates> This started because I wanted to ask if taplar can look at some jquery tomorrow and catch anything like he caught in the .attr vs .data example the other day
[18:08:29] <MassDebates> (which, btw, wasn't production code, either.)
[18:08:31] <duch_kazatel> ...
[18:08:33] <duch_kazatel> dude.
[18:08:35] <MassDebates> A php developer looked at the mockup and knew what to do.
[18:08:42] <duch_kazatel> you're conflating things again.
[18:08:44] <MassDebates> Exactly what i needed. And I learned from it.
[18:08:51] <MassDebates> No, not really.
[18:09:13] <duch_kazatel> my remark was that you implied with your 10-years comment that you must know what you're doing and that our advice is simply unnecessary.
[18:09:26] <duch_kazatel> that's why i made that quip.
[18:09:31] <MassDebates> In some facets. I wouldn't take advice on how to zip up my pants, either.
[18:09:34] <duch_kazatel> not saying at ALL that you can't talk here.
[18:09:38] <duch_kazatel> heh
[18:09:47] <duch_kazatel> good luck duder.
[18:09:53] <taplar> also fwiw, if you were implying that you'd ask me tomorrow, i most likely won't be in the room.  i got a couple vaca days coming up friday and monday
[18:10:02] <MassDebates> Oooo! Congratulations!
[18:10:10] <MassDebates> There's no rush, though, if you're willing after your vacation.
[18:10:11] <taplar> yeah, gotta burn them before i lose them
[18:10:19] <MassDebates> public sector?
[18:10:24] <taplar> private
[18:10:28] <MassDebates> okay
[18:11:33] <MassDebates> I'll cya guys later, I think I'ma head out now.
[18:12:03] <MassDebates> I had a lot of fun on the example. I learned a bit about syntax, which is a big thing for me and javascript
[18:12:21] <MassDebates> I appreciate the advice I do take and the advice I don't take all the same.
[18:12:40] <MassDebates> I know you guys are really interested in helping people and I look forward to asking you for guidance on all scriptalicious things in the future.
[18:13:08] <taplar> right on
[18:13:27] <MassDebates> If a print -does- go bad, I will certainly come here and tell you guys about it in the future.
[18:13:34] <MassDebates> Cya!
[20:00:34] <vsmith> So i'm trying to replicate a simple click action with this code but I'm having problems:  http://pastebin.com/4YTChxZ3
[20:01:00] <vsmith> This is the page http://hf4m.philoveracity.com/
[20:01:30] <vsmith> Could someone tell me what I could be doing wron?
[20:13:00] <vsmith> It should be replicating the click action on the element selected, right?
[20:20:09] <vsmith> Can  anyone help me understand?
[20:32:11] <taplar> vsmith: is that logic inside anything?
[20:32:43] <taplar> looks like it is a word press site
[20:33:01] <vsmith> Yes it is a WP site
[20:33:10] <taplar> the site doesn't appear to be treating $ as jQuery.  it's probably in noConflict mode.  try using 'jQuery' rather than '$'
[20:33:22] <vsmith> just changed the jquery
[20:33:24] <vsmith> (function($){ $(document).ready(function () { $('a[href="#tabOne"]').click(function() { $('a[href="#wptabsy-content-1"]').trigger('click'); }); $('a[href="#tabTwo"]').click(function() { $('a[href="#wptabsy-content-2"]').trigger('click'); }); }); })(window.jQuery);
[20:33:29] <vsmith> that is the new code
[20:33:50] <vsmith> but it is still not changing the tabs.  The error is gone.
[20:34:59] <vsmith> taplar:  I want a click on the image to act as a click on the tab and allow the user to navigate the tab with the image click
[20:35:30] <taplar> which image?
[20:41:09] <vsmith> There are two images currently on this page: http://hf4m.philoveracity.com/
[20:41:35] <vsmith> I am trying to get a click on the image to act as a click on the tab
[20:42:29] <taplar> try this. before you do your first click binding try to do this.  console.log($('a[href="#tabOne"]').length);
[20:42:52] <vsmith> Okay, let me vheck
[20:42:55] <vsmith> *check
[20:44:55] <vsmith> Added:  I get 1
[20:45:22] <taplar> k, that's strange.  i took your script and popped it into the console and it started working
[20:45:43] <taplar> so now I'm wondering if there is some other binding on the image that is stopping the click propagation
[20:46:31] <vsmith> Oh,   that is something I had not considered
[20:50:54] <taplar> if you console.log that element, then it is definitely finding it to bind on it.  you can try putting `debugger;` in the click handler to see if your browser debugger pauses your script when you click the image.  if it doesn't, then either there is another event handler that is preventing the event from reaching your handler, or something is removing the element you had bound on and replacing it with something else.
[20:52:13] <taplar> depending on how this slider logic is implemented that you got going on, the replacement thing could definately be happening
[20:52:49] <taplar> so try this
[20:53:42] <vsmith> Ok so where would I add `debugger;`?
[20:54:08] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/1d9wsk3u/
[20:54:21] <taplar> debugger; would go inside one of the handlers
[20:54:43] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/1d9wsk3u/1/
[20:55:04] <vsmith> okay gonna check it out.
[20:55:54] <vsmith> console output: You clicked the first tab!
[20:55:59] <taplar> :D
[20:56:00] <vsmith> so it's working?
[20:56:03] <taplar> \
[20:56:07] <taplar> yep
[20:56:22] <taplar> so the slider is replacing your original element as it does the slider
[20:56:27] <taplar> so your binding is being lost
[20:56:41] <taplar> what that new binding is is a delegate binding.  are you familiar with those?
[20:57:05] <vsmith> Oh, that's interesting!  Not familiar with a delegate binding but learning all i can
[20:57:26] <taplar> ok, so a delegate binding binds on an existing parent of expected children
[20:57:34] <taplar> the children can exist, or not, it doesn't matter
[20:57:58] <taplar> if at any point the children are created and an event originates from them that bubbles up to the parent that matches, you perform the handler
[20:59:16] <vsmith> How does that affect siblings?
[20:59:20] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ for more indepth
[20:59:35] <taplar> only children of the element
[21:00:22] <vsmith> Oh okay,  what would be the solution to work around the delegate binding?
[21:00:37] <taplar> what do you mean?
[21:01:04] <vsmith> How would I be able to cause the image clicked to allow a user to navigate through the tabs?
[21:01:20] <vsmith> Come of this is obviously going over my head atm.
[21:01:32] <taplar> that's what that does.  you change how you are currently trying to make bindings to be delegate bindings instead
[21:01:33] <vsmith> *Some
[21:01:53] <vsmith> oh okay.
[21:02:33] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/1d9wsk3u/2/
[21:03:56] <vsmith> Okay, so you used delegate binding for the #main-content element?
[21:04:01] <taplar> yep
[21:04:15] <taplar> which is a pre-existing parent of both your elements
[21:04:37] <vsmith> Oh!  that is freaking cool!
[21:05:01] <vsmith> Ha Ha!  It work Taplar!  You are awesome!
[21:05:08] <taplar> :)
[21:05:19] <vsmith> And I just learned about delegate binding!
[21:05:21] <taplar> though if I could offer a suggestion
[21:05:28] <vsmith> Yes, sure
[21:05:35] <taplar> you could simplify this a little if the html is up for a small modification
[21:06:09] <taplar> one sec
[21:06:23] <vsmith> Okay, How would I do that?  The biggest issue with the markup is that it integrates with a page builder in WP
[21:06:43] <vsmith> That page builder spits out markup like crazy
[21:08:26] <vsmith> I am definitely open to suggestions.
[21:08:43] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/1d9wsk3u/3/
[21:09:03] <taplar> if you used a shared class and a data element on the links, then you could drive the whole thing off of one binding
[21:10:32] <vsmith> That is cool.  I am looking at how maybe I can do that.
[21:11:02] <taplar> dunno if you can with your page builder like you said, but if you can, sure beats not having to repeat the binding for each one of them
[21:15:15] <vsmith> I really appreciate it Taplar  I just learned so much.
[21:15:22] <taplar> good deal
[21:15:37] <vsmith> Do you offer tutoring?
[21:16:01] <taplar> nah, i just hang out in here often and drop bad puns on peeps
[21:17:02] <taplar> the room is all about teaching, so feel free to come ask jquery questions any time.
[21:17:02] <vsmith> ha ha cool. I can appreciate that.   I will try to drop in here a bit more often.
[21:17:15] <vsmith> will do
[22:35:47] <tharkun> Good day, what are the maintained versions of jQuery? I am kind of cought in limbo without knowing which version to use.
[22:36:22] <duch_kazatel> right now the latest 3.x
[22:36:38] <tharkun>  Thanks
[22:36:42] <duch_kazatel> http://jquery.com/browser-support/ this is good info too.
[22:42:37] <tharkun> That page states the browser-support but it does not say which is the version of jquery that is supporting those browsers. I am not looking form anything special just autocomplete and date picker
[22:44:00] <duch_kazatel> the old 1.x series is for old ie.  2.x dropped those.  just grab 3.x though you also want jquery-ui as well.
[22:51:08] <hongkongphooey> how to select data-* attribute without knowing it's name? $(element).attr('[data-=*]') doesn't work
[22:51:25] <duch_kazatel> that's not how you select anything.
[22:51:36] <hongkongphooey> okay
[22:52:33] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to get the value of a data attribute without knowing its name?
[22:52:38] <duch_kazatel> because that's... kind of difficult.
[22:52:38] <hongkongphooey> yes
[22:52:46] <hongkongphooey> shouldnt be
[22:52:58] <duch_kazatel> you can try calling just .data() on the element and looking at that object.
[22:53:09] <hongkongphooey> its empty
[22:53:20] <duch_kazatel> gotta fiddle?
[23:00:10] <hongkongphooey> duch_kazatel: it works in jsfiddle but not in my app, weird, no time to debug, that for the help
[23:01:23] <tharkun> duch_kazatel: Thanks I'm looking into it now.
