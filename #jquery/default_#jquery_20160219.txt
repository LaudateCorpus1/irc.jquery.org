[00:24:15] <esaym153> question, if I have selected the button, how can I select the "fieldlabel" div ? or can I?
[00:24:37] <esaym153> parent() and closest() will only get the div right about right?
[00:39:15] <esaym153> would help if i posted the link... http://pastie.org/10728358#
[01:23:52] <ThomQ> Hi all. Quick question: At the startup of my page (    $(document).ready(function()  ) I try to hide some divs with videos in them like so: $('#fullscreenvid1').hide();
[01:24:19] <ThomQ> this all works great, except for big black squares showing for an instant just after loading the page
[01:24:39] <ThomQ> How could I counteract that?
[01:31:43] <monk3y> ThomQ; when the page first loads, assign those divs a class that has display: none initially, then .show() them instead (essentially doing the opposite of what you're doing).
[01:32:19] <ThomQ> ahh ok ok. Yeah CSS gets loaded first prob right? K thanks, doing it now
[01:32:57] <monk3y> Well the HTML elements and their assigned styles/classes.  But you sound like you want them hidden-first, shown-second.  In your current design you're showing, then hiding, then showing again later.
[01:49:45] <noregret> i'm disabling the form submit button when clicked for a better UX. How can I check if the form is actually submitted before disabling the submit button? because the form validation may fail and the button gets disabled.
[01:50:30] <noregret> i'm simply using this, https://dpaste.de/RLvF
[02:59:11] <noregret> anybody?
[03:09:59] <noregret> is there any event that gets triggered when the form starts POSTing ?
[03:30:41] <suexec> noregret, you could extend that submit handler ... and not disable the submit button until the form has been validated
[03:31:45] <noregret> suexec: cool, do you have an example on that?
[03:32:03] <suexec> noregret, give me a sec to fiddle one
[03:32:11] <noregret> thanks!
[03:37:41] <suexec> noregret, something like this, https://jsfiddle.net/36yvad7m/1/
[03:38:20] <suexec> noregret, in this example I disable the button when clicked, then perform validation, and enable it again if there is a problem. If there is no problem, the form is submitted
[03:40:23] <golserma> Can someone suggest a calendar extension similar to this? https://github.com/tommiehansen/lightRange/
[03:41:00] <noregret> suexec: got it, but that kind of validation is pretty hard to do currently for like 50 fields =)
[03:42:22] <suexec> noregret, how else do you want javascript to validate input? :) Inside your submit function, make a loop that fetches all fields and runs whatever validation etc
[03:48:35] <hellyeah> hey
[03:48:35] <hellyeah> anyone know about jqwidget
[03:51:32] <noregret> suexec: well, i'm thinking to use jqueryvalidation plugin
[03:52:39] <noregret> suexec: or then again, regarding form submission, i'm only interested in the required fields
[03:53:19] <noregret> suexec: if a form doesn't submit coz a required field is missing, don't disable the submit button, if all required fields are filled, disable the submit button
[03:53:24] <noregret> suexec: that's the logic im' looking for
[03:53:59] <suexec> noregret, aaah. You want to validate input fields on the fly .. make a function that validates all required fields
[03:54:44] <noregret> suexec: well, just for disabling/enabling the submit button logic
[03:55:28] <noregret> since the browser validates fields with the required attribute
[03:55:35] <noregret> I don't have to do it manually
[03:56:02] <suexec> noregret, not quite sure I follow .. but I guess an onchange function could solve a lot of stuff for you
[03:56:46] <noregret> suexec: what is it exactly you don't follow?
[03:56:46] <suexec> noregret, http://jqueryvalidation.org/jQuery.validator.addMethod/
[03:57:24] <suexec> noregret, and then you can find example usage here, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18604098/jquery-validate-across-multiple-fields
[03:57:49] <suexec> noregret, and working fiddle, http://jsfiddle.net/hBXL6/
[03:59:24] <noregret> suexec: in this current case, I am not actually interested in form validation. I'm doing this whole thing *just* for disabling/enabling the form button. That's it. If there are other options, i'm open to it
[04:00:37] <hellyeah> noregret:
[04:00:49] <hellyeah> you disable form button if inputs are empty?
[04:01:29] <hellyeah> what about this if user enter wrong characters or wrong info
[04:01:46] <hellyeah> foır example you want english name in your form user type American name
[04:01:58] <hellyeah> is that the case you need to validate?
[04:06:55] <noregret> hellyeah: that will be validated on the server side, and the page will reload. this is not an ajax request
[04:07:08] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:07:09] <suexec> noregret, if you simply want to enable/disable submit based on fields being empty or not, I still think the plugin I posted above is valid
[04:07:23] <hellyeah> dunno it is related but you can define regex in html5
[04:07:43] <noregret> I just want the user to avoid clicking submit several times and duplicating data
[04:07:51] <noregret> that's my goal
[04:08:08] <suexec> noregret, just disable it on click then .. ?
[04:08:12] <noregret> so the best way to disable the submit button when the form is submitted, which makes the most sense
[04:08:24] <noregret> suexec: that's what i'm doing
[04:08:31] <suexec> noregret, problem solved then ?
[04:08:41] <noregret> no
[04:09:01] <noregret> what if the submit button is clicked and a required field is not filled
[04:09:13] <noregret> the form will stay there with a disabled submit button
[04:09:22] <noregret> since the browser validates required fields
[04:09:40] <noregret> and I have around 50 fields in the form
[04:10:26] <hellyeah> html5 has required attribute
[04:10:53] <noregret> that's why i was asking if there is an event that  gets triggered when the form actually starts POSTing
[06:30:20] <eldo> Hi how create a responsive navbar ?
[06:40:22] <hellyeah> hey
[06:41:45] <hellyeah> pls someone help me with this i can select a dates and below datepicker is colored but when i create new input box and select the dates it is not applied to below datepicker can you help me to find reason why?  http://jsfiddle.net/L80n7p2k/33/
[07:18:27] <Testerbit> I see the $.get hitting the endpoint in the network panel, but why doesn’t the alert get triggered? http://pastebin.com/9jAz8Zag
[07:47:51] <csehl> is it possible to include GET when ajax POSTing? $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "auth.php?output=y", ... });
[08:30:50] <shoky> csehl: it's possible to include query params in the url, yes. (nothing to do with a GET request really)
[08:35:52] <Mark__> hey shoky, can i ask you one more question that’s related to tab UI?
[08:36:30] <Mark__> i think the code still has its problems, i thought the code fixes the problem, but there is still problem.
[08:36:40] <shoky> Mark__ only if it's not "im calling jQuery(..).tabs('add', ...)   instead of addTab()  and it doesnt work"
[08:36:48] <shoky> :P
[08:36:50] <Mark__> nope
[08:36:52] <Mark__> it’s not that.
[08:36:55] <shoky> then sure
[08:37:17] <Mark__> so, you got rid of all things that opens up the prompt window
[08:37:19] <Mark__> https://jsfiddle.net/Twisty/ryhzwkph/
[08:37:25] <Mark__> but even then,
[08:37:42] <Mark__> if i open up a new tab, the tab goes under the last tab’s div
[08:37:49] <Mark__> not under the parent’s div
[08:37:53] <Mark__> which is .tabpaenl.
[08:37:58] <Mark__> *tabpanel
[08:38:10] <shoky> if you open up a new tab , how?
[08:38:18] <Mark__> well, take a look at this website,http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/
[08:38:27] <shoky> why not fiddle
[08:38:29] <Mark__> you can create a new tab by pressing the new tab button.
[08:38:40] <Mark__> um, i could but can you take a look at my site first?
[08:38:47] <Mark__> cause there are two problems.
[08:39:03] <Mark__> you see how the tab gets inserted into the wrong place?
[08:39:17] <Mark__> so i cannot see the content.
[08:40:05] <jqwp21> hi. i have a <select> elements and want the user to be able to move the <option>items</option> with the mouse. is this possible with the native <select>? couldn't find a solution so far. the examples you see use buttons, "move up", "move down" to move the currently selected item.
[08:40:30] <jqwp21> *<select> element.
[08:41:33] <shoky> Mark__ i only removed the part that does the dialog stuff because you wanted me to show you how to add a tab automatically from the code, and just wanted to show you that. i didn't mean that's what you should do
[08:42:10] <decx> jqwp21 you cant do that with a select
[08:42:11] <shoky> Mark__ i have no idea what exact behaviour you're looking for, only you know that. so don't start removing stuff just because i did it in the fiddle because it wasn't related to the problem you asked me to solve
[08:42:20] <Mark__> umnono
[08:42:21] <decx> you can use sortable to recreate it tho
[08:42:24] <Mark__> i didn’t exactly remove the whole thing,
[08:42:35] <Mark__> i carefully removed the whole thing
[08:42:41] <Mark__> because that’s how it had to be done.
[08:42:57] <Mark__> but im afraid the content is not visible so im assuming,
[08:42:58] <shoky> Mark__ you remoevd the part that opens the dialog on click and prevents whatever is happening now (new empty tab is inserted)
[08:43:04] <Mark__> right.
[08:43:26] <shoky> so addTab is not being called for this new tab
[08:43:28] <shoky> hence it doesn't work right
[08:43:37] <jqwp21> decx, thanks, yeah i've been looking for a ready implementation of a list box with that feature.
[08:43:42] <Mark__> i see your point.
[08:43:53] <decx> jqwp21: what's the point of sorting a select tho?
[08:45:22] <shoky> Mark__  maybe this helps.. https://jsfiddle.net/ryhzwkph/12/
[08:46:15] <Mark__> thanks.
[08:46:32] <jqwp21> decx, its part of a UI,the user can add items, remove items and change their positions. ive been using a "up" and "down" button so far, but that's so ugly.
[08:47:07] <hellyeah> hety
[08:47:10] <decx> but how is that relevant in a select
[08:47:18] <hellyeah> jquery ui has something like scheduler?
[08:48:10] <jqwp21> decx, i am using a select with a size set to > 10 simply because there is no native "list box" or "list view".  :)
[08:48:11] <shoky> it has the stuff you see on the left on jqueryui.com ;p
[08:48:24] <hellyeah> like that https://www.jqwidgets.com/jquery-widgets-demo/demos/jqxscheduler/scheduler-binding-to-json.htm
[08:48:42] <decx> jqwp21: just use a list with ui sortable
[08:48:42] <shoky> nope
[08:49:06] <hellyeah> hmm  no
[08:49:07] <hellyeah> :XD
[08:49:57] <hellyeah> First of all you can create datepickers with + button as much as you want.
[08:49:57] <hellyeah> When you create first datepickers and select the dates check result datepickers. It will be colorized with green.
[08:49:57] <hellyeah> Then create new datepickers and select the dates. New date of range was not applied to result datepicker. It must have red color with highlight2 class. Can you help me to figure out how to solve it thanks.
[08:50:22] <hellyeah> #jquery
[08:50:22] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/L80n7p2k/33/
[08:50:24] <hellyeah> ops
[08:50:34] <hellyeah> right :xd
[08:53:51] <shoky> hellyeah: beforeShowDay is called for the same dates over and over. if i is 1 and then you do i++  then no dates will ever get highlight1 again, only highlight2. even the dates that are supposed to have highlight1 still
[08:54:37] <shoky> hellyeah: and you're doing "return false"  from inside beforeShowDay  which is wrong.
[08:54:51] <hellyeah> but i do inside if
[08:54:58] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:55:00] <shoky> doesn't matter
[08:55:14] <shoky> you must return an array with 3 elements
[08:56:23] <hellyeah> i commented out return false
[08:58:07] <hellyeah> but i have to check some conditions with if right
[08:58:14] <hellyeah> anyway i will brb
[08:58:15] <hellyeah> :X
[08:58:40] <shoky> if you want to do different things based on a condition, then checking a condition with if  is a good way to go :)
[09:27:30] <hellyeah> hey
[09:27:50] <hellyeah> shoky: it make all of them green but dateRange array have spesific date ranges http://jsfiddle.net/L80n7p2k/35/
[09:30:36] <shoky> hellyeah: the first item in the returned array has to be a boolean. no idea what you're doing now )
[09:30:37] <shoky> :)
[09:30:48] <hellyeah> :p
[09:30:56] <shoky> anyway, it's doing what you're telling it to do
[09:31:13] <shoky> you're returning a highlight class for ALL dates
[09:31:18] <shoky> so ALL dates become colored.
[09:31:26] <hellyeah> ah sorry
[09:32:24] <hellyeah> let me tell my intension
[09:32:34] <shoky> no need.
[09:32:40] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:32:42] <hellyeah> okey
[09:32:56] <shoky> kk
[09:33:18] <hellyeah> i am sorry if i bother you in a way :O
[09:33:48] <shoky> it just doesn't seem like you're trying hard enough
[09:34:09] <hellyeah> i am trying something
[09:34:09] <shoky> you should be much more bothered than me :)
[09:34:22] <hellyeah> right now just a sec pls
[09:34:23] <shoky> doing the same thing for about a month now
[09:34:33] <shoky> have you thought that maybe your problem is
[09:34:39] <shoky> that you keep asking people here to do it for you?
[09:34:47] <shoky> instead of just tacking it full-on
[09:34:55] <shoky> do you know how to use a debugger?
[09:35:35] <hellyeah> i know debug with console.log
[09:35:48] <shoky> that's good but a debugger is more powerful
[09:36:06] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:36:09] <shoky> you can go through the execution of your code, line by line
[09:36:19] <hellyeah> ah thats good
[09:36:21] <shoky> and see what the state of all variables is, during each line of execution
[09:36:35] <shoky> but you need to practice a bit until you can use it efficiently
[09:36:40] <hellyeah> i am doing all the time with visual studio
[09:36:53] <shoky> good. so there's the same thing right in the browser's devtools
[09:37:06] <shoky> in chrome it's the "Sources" tab
[09:37:32] <shoky> you can set breakpoints
[09:37:47] <hellyeah> with f9
[09:37:50] <shoky> and step over/step-in
[09:37:50] <hellyeah> ?
[09:37:59] <shoky> donno what f9 is
[09:38:07] <shoky> you set breakpoint by clikcing on the line number
[09:38:12] <shoky> in the sources tab
[09:38:30] <shoky> another way is to put in your code this statement:  debugger;
[09:38:42] <shoky> and it will act as a breakpoint, if the devtools is open
[09:39:14] <hellyeah> there is nothing in source tab
[09:40:02] <hellyeah> let me good it a bit
[09:40:15] <shoky> click on the left on that "play" icon and you can see the files tree
[09:40:22] <shoky> or ctrl-p  to type in a file name
[09:40:45] <shoky> anyway play with it,  see also  http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[09:41:00] <shoky> even though that has examples from firefox/firebug  but it's similar
[09:41:22] <shoky> but anyway.  if you have a problem like.. all the dates are green
[09:41:45] <shoky> you just need to start thinking - why is that.   and it's obvious WHERE the problem is because the only place that determines what color the dates have
[09:41:50] <shoky> is `beforeShowDay`
[09:41:52] <shoky> and you know that.
[09:42:04] <decx> oh now you're using ui datepicker huh
[09:42:06] <shoky> so you look in there for the problem. they're all green - meaning you're telling it to make them all green
[09:42:16] <shoky> meaning - you're returning the "green" highlight class for all dates
[09:42:26] <shoky> just use your brain, please :|
[09:42:47] <decx> hope you can bill all those 600 hours ^^
[09:42:54] <shoky> hellyeah the best advice i can give you is to leave this channel (and all channels) for a few weeks
[09:42:57] <shoky> seriously.
[09:43:19] <shoky> or to stay, but never ask any question
[09:43:26] <shoky> if you can do that :)
[09:43:37] <hellyeah> it was stupid i did
[09:43:40] <hellyeah> okey
[09:43:45] <hellyeah> can i tell you something
[09:43:48] <hellyeah> just one thing
[09:43:51] <shoky> of course
[09:44:07] <shoky> you can say anything you want, and ask anything you want. i'm just giving advice :)
[09:44:09] <hellyeah> i didnt use my brain first of all i confess
[09:44:17] <shoky> heh
[09:44:22] <hellyeah> shoky: sure you are doing good
[09:44:31] <hellyeah> beforeshow day return three thing
[09:44:48] <hellyeah> first bool value, second css class, three tooltip things
[09:44:57] <hellyeah> toooltip text i guess
[09:45:13] <shoky> and if you don't want to just guess?
[09:45:15] <shoky> but to be sure?
[09:45:17] <shoky> what do you do?
[09:45:37] <hellyeah> sorry
[09:45:46] <hellyeah> i guess  i typed automatically
[09:45:51] <shoky> why sorry
[09:45:53] <shoky> i'm just asking you a question
[09:46:03] <hellyeah> no no dont get me wrong
[09:46:12] <hellyeah> everytime i am typing "i guess" automatically
[09:46:15] <shoky> i'm not getting you wrong, i'm just asking you a question :S
[09:46:18] <hellyeah> i need to give up doinmg this
[09:46:21] <shoky> ah
[09:46:35] <shoky> ok but still, it seems like you're asking me if this is true
[09:46:40] <shoky> meaning , you're guessing
[09:46:41] <hellyeah> because i guess means okey this is it but i am not certainly sure
[09:46:52] <hellyeah> thats why i need to give up
[09:46:55] <shoky> but stil. even if you're not guessing
[09:47:01] <shoky> you can still asnwer my question.
[09:47:06] <hellyeah> anyway third oıption is for tooltip
[09:47:11] <shoky> if you don't want to guess, and want to be sure, what do you do?
[09:47:22] <hellyeah> when you hover over the dates tooltip shows up
[09:47:28] <hellyeah> check api
[09:47:32] <hellyeah> i already checked
[09:47:38] <shoky> ok cool
[09:47:58] <hellyeah> beforeshowday bool value, css class, tooltip
[09:48:16] <hellyeah> so there must be three argument
[09:48:42] <shoky> 3 items in the array, yep
[09:49:48] <hellyeah> what i try to is to check daterange.indexOf(dateString) === -1 that means dateRange is not there so i returns [false, "" ,""] then outside if i returned [enabled, datehighlight, "sometext]; enabled is true btw. Does it seem correct http://jsfiddle.net/L80n7p2k/38/
[09:50:36] <shoky> you're always returning an array with 3 items - that part is correct now, yes
[09:50:50] <hellyeah> okey
[09:51:12] <hellyeah> in that example i am getting dates from first and second datepicker as start date and enddate
[09:51:21] <hellyeah> and push it into dateRange array
[09:51:25] <shoky> you don't have to keep explaining what you're doing
[09:51:37] <shoky> everybody in this channel already knows it for a month now :)
[09:51:40] <hellyeah> sure sorry
[09:52:11] <printForever> how to check if the user came from a mobile.domain.com to domain.com?
[09:52:16] <hellyeah> hmm i did "datehighligt" + i which should give different class to dateofrange
[09:52:36] <shoky> hellyeah but you're returning the same i for all of them
[09:52:44] <shoky> so all of them get the same color
[09:52:50] <shoky> all of the enabled ones, i mean
[09:53:16] <hellyeah> actually i initialize dateRange everytine i create new element
[09:53:26] <shoky> hellyeah also your range checking seems wrong.. donno what you're trying to do with .indexOf
[09:53:28] <hellyeah> so each time there must be different range of dates
[09:53:49] <hellyeah> well if indexOf return -1
[09:54:03] <hellyeah> the days are not in dateString
[09:54:09] <hellyeah> so doesnt need to be enabled
[09:54:13] <shoky> anyways
[09:54:18] <shoky> it's doing what you're telling it to do.
[09:54:19] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:54:23] <shoky> remember that
[09:54:27] <hellyeah> sure
[09:54:34] <hellyeah> i am reading
[09:54:44] <shoky> remember, bforeShowDay keeps getting called again and again and again
[09:54:50] <shoky> for the same dates
[09:54:52] <shoky> so if you do i++
[09:55:00] <shoky> then later when beforeShowDate is called for the same dates as before
[09:55:03] <shoky> now i is 2
[09:55:08] <shoky> so they will all get "highlight2"
[09:55:20] <shoky> and you'll lose all highlight1 dates
[09:55:26] <shoky> so you only get red, no green
[09:55:44] <taplar> #dt is also being reinitialized multiple times potentially
[09:55:52] <shoky> you need to remember somehow all the previous ranges/colors too
[09:55:57] <hellyeah> crap
[09:55:58] <printForever> um... shoky, taplar... :)
[09:55:58] <hellyeah> :(
[09:56:02] <printForever> how to check if the user came from a mobile.domain.com to domain.com?
[09:56:08] <shoky> you can't just do i++  because all will now get 2
[09:56:24] <shoky> printForever sounds like a server-side question
[09:56:34] <printForever> shoky, browser offers history
[09:56:36] <shoky> anyway, not jquery related
[09:56:52] <hellyeah> taplar: i understand what you said
[09:57:19] <printForever> will document.referrer work?
[09:57:37] <shoky> try it?
[09:57:40] <hellyeah> taplar: dunno but datepicker didnt work here http://jsfiddle.net/L80n7p2k/39/
[09:58:01] <printForever> will document.referrer with private/incognito mode?
[09:58:25] <hellyeah> document.reffrrer seems like javascript method
[09:58:47] <taplar> it's just an property on the document
[09:59:14] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:59:34] <hellyeah> it is silly that calling datepickers when you click create button over and over again
[09:59:52] <shoky> hellyeah stop asking questions already.
[10:00:39] <hellyeah> ok
[10:01:35] <hellyeah> dang
[10:07:58] <hellyeah> i added datePart to the body already
[10:08:04] <hellyeah> so it should work damn
[10:20:24] <decx> hell left?
[10:20:26] <decx> wow
[10:20:33] <decx> you did it shoky
[10:22:26] <taplar> lol, i kinda feel back that that is considered an accomplishment
[10:22:36] <decx> na it'S good
[10:22:37] * taplar didn't really read the whole convo
[10:22:47] <decx> now with datepicker ui there's so much docs out trhere
[10:23:38] <shoky> lol
[10:23:51] <decx> trying to explain stuff in here takes probably longer than finding the exact function on so ^^
[10:25:01] <decx> 2 weeks from now hell will be back a new dev, outsupporting robert
[10:25:16] <shoky> :D
[10:25:17] <taplar> i'll take that bet
[10:26:02] <taplar> robert gets burned out and goes on his europe vacation.  hellyeah fills in
[10:26:07] <taplar> sign of armageddon
[10:27:49] <taplar> come on, if you guys don't laugh then i'm just being mean
[10:28:46] <decx> chuckles dont get written yo
[10:29:25] <decx> cic
[10:29:30] <decx> chuckle into collar
[10:29:39] <ornerymoose> Hi, currently you can only select one checkbox (which I want), but the child input field per checkbox will stay enabled even i select a different checkbox: https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/17241/ . I’d like it so at ANY given time, only ONE checkbox and its child text field is enabled. Any suggestions?
[10:29:58] <awkwardCough> taplar hah
[10:30:09] <taplar> lol
[10:30:17] <taplar> thank's pair partner
[10:31:07] <decx> ornerymoose: that's a job for radio boxes
[10:31:20] <decx> regardless of your js
[10:32:48] <ornerymoose> true, radioboxes would be better for such a case
[10:42:02] <decx> also you generally want to change prop() not attr()
[10:43:28] <decx> also # /17241 this fiddle has seen some shit
[10:43:46] <ornerymoose> lols
[10:44:15] <decx> you dont actually traverse in your thing
[10:44:51] <ornerymoose> use .each outside of change?
[10:45:19] <decx> no you can traveres from the changed to its parent label and from there to the labels label siblings
[10:51:07] <decx> ornerymoose: here are examples with traversal ( https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/17242/ ) and as an alternative with precaching and using the index ( https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/17243/ )
[10:51:46] <decx> traversal is more robust but the index approach is cute
[10:52:02] <ornerymoose> Ah I see
[10:52:11] <ornerymoose> Ill admit jquery is not my strong suit
[10:52:25] <ornerymoose> i like that first example
[10:52:27] <decx> then stick to traversal
[10:53:27] <ornerymoose> Right on. Appreciate the input and examples
[11:18:08] <_TWG_> Does anyone have any suggestions on a good validation library?
[11:27:15] <decx> jquery validate is fine
[11:27:18] <decx> and wildly used
[11:33:28] <mc_plectrum> how can i fill e.g. the google input form? In the browser console it works fine, but not inside my webView
[11:35:00] <mc_plectrum> e.g. $(„head“).remove() does work, but $(„#lst-ib“).val = „ foo“ does not
[11:55:13] <JD-Robbs> Would anyone know how the following would be re-written using widgets to future-proof it? --> $.ui.plugin.add("draggable", "fooDrag", {start: function(e, ui) {}});
[11:55:49] <JD-Robbs> Because `plugin` is deprecated.
[11:55:52] <robertmaxrees> https://jqueryui.com/widget/
[11:56:50] <JD-Robbs> thanks robertmaxrees, however I couldn't get those examples to work since my case is a plugin of a plugin. I.e. a plugin for draggable.
[11:57:06] <robertmaxrees> so you want to extend current functionality?
[11:57:19] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/widget-factory/extending-widgets/
[11:57:58] <JD-Robbs> Yup, current functionality of draggable. Specifically, I want to do that with an "alsoDrag" plugin I found on the web - seeing jQueryUI has "alsoResize" but, apparently, "alsoDrag" is an edge-case. :)(
[11:58:10] <robertmaxrees> right, look at that second link.
[11:58:19] <robertmaxrees> it gives you exactly what you want :)
[12:00:00] <JD-Robbs> Oh wow, that very much looks like it! Thanks! I kept looking at jQuery's docs as I thought that's where the functionality/pluggability lies :)
[12:00:08] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[12:02:50] <guest271314> hi
[12:05:23] <guest271314> "jQuery.Deferred is now Promises/A+ compatible" appears at https://blog.jquery.com/2015/07/13/jquery-3-0-and-jquery-compat-3-0-alpha-versions-released/ , though `.done()` was not updated ?
[12:08:02] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:08:04] <robertmaxrees> what are you asking?
[12:09:42] <guest271314> Was `.done()` not included in update to `jQuery.Deferred()` ?
[12:10:04] <robertmaxrees> the update was to make .then() Promises/A+ compatible.
[12:10:33] <guest271314> Not `.done()` ? See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35482524/jquery-3-0-promises
[12:11:04] <snover> read the first answer to that
[12:11:08] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:11:12] <robertmaxrees> you want .then()
[12:11:30] <robertmaxrees> .done() and .fail() are kind of jquery specific - you really want .then()
[12:11:36] <robertmaxrees> https://promisesaplus.com/
[12:11:56] <guest271314> Yes, why is this statement at blog post "jQuery.Deferred is now Promises/A+ compatible" ?
[12:12:15] <robertmaxrees> because they weren't before, and now they are.
[12:12:38] <robertmaxrees> the spec for promises originated outside of jquery - the original jquery implementation was not compliant with that spec.
[12:13:12] <guest271314> Is `.done()` not considered part of `jQuery.Deferred()` ?
[12:13:18] <robertmaxrees> .done() is still available.
[12:13:22] <robertmaxrees> but you should favor .then()
[12:13:39] <snover> i’m not sure about the confusion. `done` is not a Promises/A+ API
[12:13:45] <shoky> guest271314: to be Promises/A+ compatible means: to have a .then() method that behaves according to Promises/A+ spec.  so if jQuery.Deferred's now have a .then() method that follows the promises/a+ spec, then jQuery.Deferreds are not Promises/A+ compatible
[12:13:54] <snover> there is no “compatibility” with Promises/A+ for `done`, it is not part of Promises/A+
[12:13:55] <shoky> now*
[12:14:11] <snover> it cannot be compatible with a thing that does not exist
[12:14:18] <robertmaxrees> they're conflating jquery's convenience methods for promises with the spec.
[12:14:45] <guest271314> Yes, but statement is not entire accurate at blog; without explanation of exclusion of `.done()` from statement ?
[12:14:55] <robertmaxrees> it's very accurate.
[12:15:01] <robertmaxrees> .done() has nothing to do with Promises/A+
[12:15:02] <snover> i don’t know how else to explain this
[12:15:08] <robertmaxrees> .done() is a convenience method supplied by jquery
[12:15:10] <robertmaxrees> that's all it is.
[12:15:22] <robertmaxrees> they didn't mention it in the blog post because nothing about it changed.
[12:15:23] <shoky> you can have a .done() and a .whatever() that do anything you want and still be compatible.  as long as you have a .then() that follows the spec
[12:15:26] <snover> Promises/A+ is the `then` method. `done` is not the `then` method, therefore it is not Promises/A+.
[12:15:54] <robertmaxrees> how many more mods can we get in on this explanation.
[12:16:07] <taplar> well....i'm not a mod but...
[12:16:08] <NoiseEee> i promise its not done
[12:16:15] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[12:16:17] <robertmaxrees> +++
[12:16:26] <shoky> ;]
[12:16:46] <taplar> i'm very confused why they don't say that the .is() method is excluded
[12:16:52] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:16:55] <guest271314> Why is this not explained at api documentation ? Do not use `.done()` here, unless attempting to pass an array of functions, though for those that may consider `done()` and `.then()` to be equivalent, it may be confusing
[12:17:11] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating things again.
[12:17:23] <robertmaxrees> you can use done if you want, but you should favor .then()
[12:17:34] <robertmaxrees> they have never been equivalent.
[12:18:46] <SpecialTechnique> Is there a reason why this would append twice?
[12:18:47] <SpecialTechnique> https://jsfiddle.net/bs1kyw4j/
[12:19:21] <SpecialTechnique> Like it works properly on the fiddle, but when I try to add into my local site, it's appending twice
[12:19:59] <taplar> you got multiple slide or title?
[12:20:16] <shoky> SpecialTechnique: `content` is a string, you can't do appendTo on a string..
[12:20:26] <SpecialTechnique> it's append()
[12:20:36] <shoky> SpecialTechnique: line 5, appendTo
[12:20:49] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTechnique i explained this yesterday mano :)
[12:20:52] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[12:20:53] <SpecialTechnique> Oh woah
[12:20:55] <robertmaxrees> you'll see an error.
[12:21:16] <SpecialTechnique> https://jsfiddle.net/bs1kyw4j/1/
[12:21:19] <SpecialTechnique> sorry wrong one!
[12:21:40] <SpecialTechnique> Shoky, robertmaxrees
[12:22:02] <shoky> SpecialTechnique: in the fiddle there is no reason that it would append twice, so it doesn't.  in your local site, it does append twice, so there must be a reason :)
[12:22:17] <robertmaxrees> you're probably calling that logic twice.
[12:22:25] <guest271314> What is purpose of `.done()` ? if not to perform similarly to spec compliant `.then()`
[12:22:36] <shoky> guest271314 that is not at all the purpose of .done()
[12:22:53] <robertmaxrees> .done() is a convenience method for resolved promises.  it is not meant to perform similarly to .then()
[12:23:30] <guest271314> What is a "convenience method" ?
[12:23:53] <shoky> the purpose of done() is to attach a callback that will execute when the promise is resolved
[12:23:58] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[12:24:20] <taplar> technically anything that removes some boiler plating is a convenience method
[12:29:10] <guest271314> Interesting, fwiw http://plnkr.co/edit/5mR61V1R6kXYX5Mx5cgZ
[12:29:43] <taplar> man, how many paste sites are there...
[12:30:12] <robertmaxrees> what's interesting about that?
[12:30:51] <robertmaxrees> also: "main thread finished" is a misnomer.
[12:31:04] <guest271314> The results are not interesting. It is interesting that done and then perform differently though this is not directly mentioned in the documentations
[12:31:17] <robertmaxrees> why would you explicitly mention that.
[12:31:31] <robertmaxrees> they're different methods.
[12:31:40] <guest271314> Why not ?
[12:32:06] <guest271314> They return different results
[12:32:06] <robertmaxrees> so we should update the docs for .animate() to clarify that they're not the same as .css()
[12:32:48] <robertmaxrees> sure, so do .animate() and .css()
[12:32:56] <guest271314> No. That is not the same.
[12:32:59] <robertmaxrees> sure it is.
[12:33:04] <robertmaxrees> they both impact styling of an element.
[12:33:19] <robertmaxrees> you're confused about the purpose of .then() vs .done()
[12:34:17] <guest271314> Well, not personally confused, here; though intuitively would expect them to return similar results instead of opposite results
[12:34:35] <robertmaxrees> they're not "opposite results".  they're different.
[12:34:44] <robertmaxrees> they're differently named methods: why would you expect them to be the same?
[12:35:36] <guest271314> This is what helped, here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5436327/jquery-deferreds-and-promises-then-vs-done ; not the documentation
[12:35:59] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what your issue is - you chose to not read the two pages of documentation.
[12:36:58] <guest271314> Where in two pages of documentation does difference between then and done appear ?
[12:37:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:37:08] <robertmaxrees> dude.
[12:37:10] <robertmaxrees> listen.
[12:37:48] <shoky> also... jquery 3 is not out yet. there is no documentation yet
[12:37:48] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make any sense - you're arguing that the docs should clarify what the difference is between two methods when the documentation already does that.
[12:38:02] <robertmaxrees> shoky the api docs are starting to be updated though.
[12:38:26] <robertmaxrees> but it doesn't matter - the docs aren't there for historical record or to explain one thing vs. another unless it's really salient.  in this case, it isn't.
[12:38:27] <shoky> well i only checked .then and .done pages
[12:38:46] <robertmaxrees> if you REALLY think the docs need to be updated, submit an issue to the repo and somebody might look into it.
[12:39:16] <shoky> it wouldn't hurt if they had a note on each one saying it's sync or async. or at least one in .done saying it can by sync
[12:39:18] <shoky> can be
[12:39:48] <robertmaxrees> i don't think that's necessary personally - it should be pretty clear that they're basically registering callbacks.
[12:40:26] <shoky> for most uses it's irrelevant, i agree
[12:41:21] <guest271314> Just re-read documentations; the apparent difference is that .then returns a new Promise, whereas .done does not
[12:41:39] <shoky> pretty big difference
[12:41:42] <robertmaxrees> and that they provide different APIs.
[12:42:44] <guest271314> Also, without reading the SO post then vs done, would not necessarily be aware that .done does not allow changing of return value
[12:42:57] <robertmaxrees> what return value?
[12:43:11] <shoky> why would you not be aware of that, .done docs say nothing about being able to do that
[12:43:14] <robertmaxrees> you can't change the value of a promise once it's resolved or rejected.
[12:44:35] <guest271314> http://stackoverflow.com/a/15694010/2801559
[12:45:01] <robertmaxrees> why do you keep linking to SO posts?
[12:45:26] <guest271314> This is first time in chat here, is this not appropriate ?
[12:45:28] <robertmaxrees> .done() is NOT a promises/a+ compliant method.  it is not the same as .then().
[12:46:04] <guest271314> Actual documentations do not thoroughly describe these differences
[12:46:11] <robertmaxrees> because they don't need to.
[12:46:24] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't assume two methods do the same thing.
[12:46:37] <robertmaxrees> the docs explain what each method does.  that should be all you need.
[12:47:20] <guest271314> Ok, fair enough. Thank you for your feedback. Cheers
[12:47:58] <robertmaxrees> if you're confused about the differences, that's OK - that's why we have places like this channel: we're here to help clarify things and pioint you in the right direction.
[12:48:09] <robertmaxrees> but insisting repeatedly that the docs are somehow wrong is a little... much.
[12:49:00] <guest271314> Did not insist docs are "wrong" ? Where is that in posts here ? Threw out there that docs could, perhaps, be more definitive
[12:49:28] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* i'm not playing this game today.
[12:49:32] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[12:49:56] <guest271314> No games here, whatsoever. Direct
[12:50:11] <robertmaxrees> you're being pedantic.  you knew what i meant :)
[12:50:15] <robertmaxrees> it's no big deal.  moving on.
[12:51:11] <guest271314> Thanks again for your feedback; was actually attempting to take position of a user just stumbling across jQuery. Cheers.
[12:52:35] <robertmaxrees> anybody working on anything interesting?
[12:52:43] <taplar> some chilli
[12:52:53] <robertmaxrees> nice.
[12:53:04] <taplar> and a new deadline that came out of the blue this morning
[12:53:35] <robertmaxrees> those are fun.
[12:54:01] <taplar> heh.  "So, they're under the impression that they will have it by the end of march"
[12:54:05] <taplar> wtf told them that?
[12:54:18] <taplar> love those
[12:54:36] <robertmaxrees> fun project at least?
[12:54:55] <taplar> ehhhh, lol
[12:55:00] <taplar> work's work
[12:55:06] <robertmaxrees> hah
[12:55:07] <robertmaxrees> fair enough
[12:55:37] <taplar> what about you?  anything fun out of that meeting the other day?
[12:56:41] <robertmaxrees> we're in the middle of a pretty big project right now.
[14:09:04] <nitrospectide> How can I create a simple animation that fades in an item, holds it onscreen for a few seconds, then fades it out while fading in something different? I want to create a sequence of maybe 6 items.
[14:11:20] <robertmaxrees> you want animate and settimeout.
[14:22:19] <PuruPuru> hey, $(selector).after() to append an image, the problem is that the parent div doesn't extend once the image is loaded how do i fix this?
[14:22:45] <robertmaxrees> .after() doesn't append.
[14:22:49] <robertmaxrees> it inserts after.
[14:22:52] <robertmaxrees> you want .append()
[14:23:49] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, yeah, it's cool after is what i need
[14:23:56] <robertmaxrees> uh
[14:24:02] <robertmaxrees> then the div won't extend.
[14:24:03] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, i meant append in the sense of actually adding it
[14:24:14] <arc_> : /
[14:24:23] <robertmaxrees> but you're not inserting it to the parent div.
[14:24:26] <arc_> why would the image affect the size of the div if it's outside of the div
[14:25:03] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, <div id='this doesn't get bigger'><div id='what-i-select'></div>->>>where stuff goes</div>
[14:25:11] <robertmaxrees> then make a fiddle.
[14:25:19] <robertmaxrees> because it should work fine.
[14:25:31] <robertmaxrees> unless you've got some weird css going on.
[14:25:33] <qunitfledgling> unless it's got a fixed dimension(s)
[14:25:41] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:25:41] <PuruPuru> i got bootstrap
[14:25:52] <robertmaxrees> is the div not getting wider?
[14:25:55] <qunitfledgling> right click on the parent and inspect the css in the dev tools
[14:25:59] <jsparks> hi I’m attenpting to get <a> text get render after <i> is it possible to get it done with jquery using object building? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8249923e179aeaa6f43c
[14:26:05] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, ye, the div is not getting longer
[14:26:12] <robertmaxrees> wider or taller?
[14:26:17] <PuruPuru> taller
[14:26:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah, inspect the div and see if there's a static height set.
[14:26:40] <PuruPuru> there's no static height
[14:26:44] <PuruPuru> it's a form
[14:26:50] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.  without seeing the code it's hard to help.
[14:27:01] <qunitfledgling> anything can have a static height.  saying it's a form isn't relevant
[14:27:50] <robertmaxrees> jsparks https://jsfiddle.net/r7octsLk/
[14:27:53] <robertmaxrees> is this not what you wanted?
[14:28:12] <robertmaxrees> because that looks like it works.
[14:29:54] <jsparks> robertmaxrees thak you for your help but I need to get the icon before the a text
[14:30:21] <robertmaxrees> then append the icon then the text.
[14:30:34] <jsparks> how come?
[14:30:40] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[14:30:59] <robertmaxrees> you want to insert an i and then an a.
[14:31:01] <jsparks> I get the ideia what I mean is how can I do it?
[14:31:21] <phelix_> Trying to make an ajax request and I keep getting forbidden 403 "request header was not provided or has invalid format" I added headers: { 'Content-Type' : 'application/hal+json;charset=UTF-8' } but still doesn't seem to be helping. Could I be missing somehting?
[14:31:43] <phelix_> I can access the url in my browser just fine.
[14:31:43] <robertmaxrees> jsparks by literally doing two appends.
[14:31:43] <robertmaxrees> jsparks https://jsfiddle.net/r7octsLk/1/
[14:32:19] <robertmaxrees> phelix dunno - what backend are you using?
[14:32:34] <jsparks> this is the result I expect <a href="#"><i class="fa fa-users text-aqua"></i> text here</a>
[14:33:05] <robertmaxrees> ah, you want the text after the i.
[14:33:06] <phelix_> well the url I am going to just returns json results.
[14:33:08] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.
[14:33:38] <robertmaxrees> phelix ... that doesn't answer my question.  i have no idea what header your server is expecting.
[14:34:02] <phelix_> When I use a headers plugin that shows that data and I view that url it displays this: Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8

[14:35:47] <jsparks> robertmaxrees THANK YOU SO MUCH :)
[14:35:52] <robertmaxrees> jsparks sure.
[14:35:54] <robertmaxrees> jsparks get the idea?
[14:36:06] <jsparks> yes I do get it now
[14:36:17] <jsparks> so simple yet … so far
[14:36:20] <jsparks> :D
[14:36:33] <taplar> simple, yet hard to read
[14:36:39] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:36:49] <robertmaxrees> great example of why we don't use jquery as a templating engine.
[14:36:58] <robertmaxrees> i would've just used text concatenation here.
[14:37:51] <jsparks> I like to have the power other way around, sometimes i get stuck :D
[14:38:00] <robertmaxrees> that's not powerful.
[14:38:02] <robertmaxrees> that's confusing.
[14:38:02] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:38:16] <jsparks> lol
[14:38:21] <jsparks> you’re right
[14:38:22] <taplar> it took me a few seconds to put the pieces together, vs it just being readable
[14:40:51] <jsparks> taplar what about this one lol https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e80ae84b66dfee67812c
[14:41:00] <robertmaxrees> D:
[14:41:05] <robertmaxrees> noooo
[14:41:43] <robertmaxrees> lines.push(fillIntervention(data.content[i])); - you should read about the native javascript .map() method for arrays.
[14:41:45] <jsparks> robertmaxrees it works perfect :)
[14:42:09] <robertmaxrees> err.
[14:42:13] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make it good code ;)
[14:42:52] <Uhkis> why map instead of ye olde looping? is it faster?
[14:42:53] <jsparks> humm I came across map() several times but is not AS6 or something?
[14:43:03] <robertmaxrees> you mean ES6, and no.
[14:43:05] <robertmaxrees> it's ES5.
[14:43:12] <robertmaxrees> you're thinking of the Map type.
[14:43:20] <jsparks> sorry yes Ecma Script 6
[14:43:29] <robertmaxrees> *ecmascript 6 - one word :)
[14:43:34] <robertmaxrees> and no, the array method is ES5.
[14:43:37] <jsparks> yes yes
[14:43:45] <jsparks> you read my mind robertmaxrees
[14:43:46] <jsparks> :)
[14:44:03] <robertmaxrees> also: you should look at using a templating engine, since jquery sucks at doing that.
[14:44:34] <jsparks> robertmaxrees agree on that
[14:45:49] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, I did a JSFiddle of my problem
[14:45:55] <PuruPuru> and it doesn't seem to appear there
[14:46:10] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/r7octsLk/3/
[14:46:15] <jsparks> in a week or so I will do it for now I just can’t spent that much time … learning a template engine like mustache
[14:46:16] <robertmaxrees> what didn't appear?  the problem?
[14:46:47] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, yeah, stuff reaching outside of parent div
[14:46:55] <jsparks> ok guys thank you again kitchen is wating
[14:46:57] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, and now i just realized
[14:46:59] <jsparks> :P
[14:47:20] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, in my situation too, some of it works, and some doesnt
[14:47:31] <Cammo1> datatables question, using makeeditable when I click a column with a select box that has 2 options its auto selecting an option and submitting it reguardless of the current selection
[14:47:32] <robertmaxrees> PuruPuru okay.
[14:47:45] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, i'm adding: $('#thread-image').parent().after('<div class="form-group"><div class="form-control"><a href="'+data.url+'">Image</a><img src="http://localhost'+data.url+'"><code>'+data.markdown+'<code></div></div>');
[14:47:51] <robertmaxrees> please don't paste code in the channel.
[14:47:53] <robertmaxrees> it's hard to read.
[14:48:03] <robertmaxrees> paste the code somwehre else and share that.
[14:48:18] <PuruPuru> <a href></a> shows normally but the image goes outside
[14:48:40] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:48:46] <Cammo1> for instance, dropdown options of "1":"On" and "0":"Off" if the current value is On, when I click the dropdown and click outside the box it changes my On to Off even though I never selected anything
[14:48:53] <Cammo1> any ideas on how to stop that?
[14:49:10] <robertmaxrees> Cammo1 you're going to have a hard time getting datatables support here fwiw.
[14:50:11] <Cammo1> Well from what I see someone tried to get them to create a channel for it and the datatables website admin shot the idea down
[14:50:17] <robertmaxrees> that was me :)
[14:50:19] <robertmaxrees> i asked them to.
[14:50:33] <robertmaxrees> because we get a lot of people asking for support here.
[14:50:48] <robertmaxrees> but we're rarely able to help.
[14:50:53] <PuruPuru> http://pastebin.com/QFVmNri2
[14:51:28] <robertmaxrees> PuruPuru awesome - so where's the issue here?
[14:51:45] <PuruPuru> where should i upload images?
[14:51:48] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, ^
[14:51:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:51:55] <robertmaxrees> why do you need images?
[14:52:01] <PuruPuru> image pastebin
[14:52:09] <taplar> show the issue in a fiddle
[14:52:10] <robertmaxrees> are the images screenshots?
[14:52:13] <robertmaxrees> because no.
[14:52:15] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[14:52:17] <roadRunner_11033> anyone know where i can find a minimalistic jquery ui theme?
[14:52:19] <taplar> hard to debug pictures
[14:52:45] <robertmaxrees> debugging by screenshot is like dealing with the world's slowest REPL
[14:53:37] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, http://uploadpie.com/Z4MeQ
[14:53:46] <robertmaxrees> dude
[14:53:53] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, the problem won't show in fiddle
[14:54:00] <robertmaxrees> no screenshots of problems.
[14:54:09] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[14:54:31] <robertmaxrees> they don't help us.
[14:54:50] <roadRunner_11033> which jquery modal dialog plugin (not jquery ui) do you can recommend?
[14:54:52] <taplar> fwiw, you can copy and paste both html and css from the dev console to other places...
[14:55:10] <Cammo1> PuruPuru so  I see the image is escaping the container.. is that what your trying to fix?
[14:55:17] <PuruPuru> Cammo1, yes
[14:55:22] <robertmaxrees> roadRunner_11033 check out jqmodal
[14:55:29] <robertmaxrees> PuruPuru make a fiddle.
[14:55:30] <robertmaxrees> please.
[14:56:09] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, idk how to make a fiddle that uploads image files saves them on the server and returns the location of the resource..
[14:56:17] <robertmaxrees> you don't need that part.
[14:56:26] <robertmaxrees> just emulate the appending an image bit.
[14:56:28] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, so that you can then add that resource
[14:56:40] <arc_> i'm not super familiar with bootstrap but don't you need to add a class to images for them to work properly in the layout ...
[14:56:47] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, i did, but in jsfiddle it seemed to work, without using an image
[14:57:06] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, just like in my pic, the image part gets added like it should, it's only the image that escapes the container
[14:57:18] <roadRunner_11033> robertmaxrees, http://jquery.iceburg.net/jqModal/ you mean?
[14:57:27] <robertmaxrees> roadRunner_11033 yep.
[14:57:33] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, i'm sorry idk how to use images in jsfiddle
[14:57:45] <robertmaxrees> PuruPuru did you include bootstrap in your fiddle?
[14:57:56] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, yes
[14:58:03] <robertmaxrees> and you can use something like placehold.it
[15:00:01] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/cd4a61mc/
[15:00:13] <Cammo1> robertmaxrees, well I have onblur: submit enabled, and when I click the select box and then click away from it without selecting anything it submits.
[15:00:19] <PuruPuru> press the insert new bar button to get a foo robertmaxrees
[15:00:32] <Cammo1> robertmaxrees which I realize is by design, but whats odd is it reordered my options list
[15:00:39] <robertmaxrees> Camaban uh
[15:00:41] <robertmaxrees> err, Cammo1
[15:01:01] <Cammo1> robertmaxrees and instead of retaining the old value it defaults it to the 2nd option in my value list
[15:01:18] <robertmaxrees> Cammo1 sorry, i think i may not have explained something very well - you're probably not going to get datatables help in here.
[15:01:42] <robertmaxrees> PuruPuru awesome - so that's the issue?
[15:01:49] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, yeas
[15:02:10] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, didn't think about using sth like placehold.it
[15:02:26] <robertmaxrees> so i'm inspecting the parent .form-control
[15:02:31] <robertmaxrees> height: 34px;
[15:02:43] <arc_> yep
[15:02:46] <robertmaxrees> iirc .form-control is for... form controls.
[15:02:49] <robertmaxrees> not for images.
[15:02:57] <robertmaxrees> so you'll want to restructure things.
[15:03:14] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, and furthermore, when I add new foos or bars, whatever, they will get on top of eachother, partly because apparently the image doesn't seem to have any height for the browser it just escapes any container
[15:03:15] <robertmaxrees> i might hit up ##bootstrap with any other questions you have.
[15:03:30] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, yeah, i'll go there
[15:03:43] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, i thought i was doing stuff wrong in jquery too
[15:03:44] <robertmaxrees> either way, you probably don't want to append to .form-control
[15:05:06] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, yeah that seems to be it
[15:05:35] <Cammo1> robertmaxreese well I assumed you were familiar with it, and this isnt something crazy, figured you might know what was causing it.
[15:05:55] <robertmaxrees> Cammo1 :) nope.  that's why i mentioned you'd probably have better luck elsewhere :)
[15:06:08] <robertmaxrees> you're more than welcome to hang out and see if somebody comes along, but I wouldn't expect it./
[15:07:31] <PuruPuru> robertmaxrees, .form-control was the culprit
[15:08:16] <taplar> lol, thought that was already identified
[15:08:34] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:08:37] <robertmaxrees> i just told you that.
[15:08:57] <taplar> fwiw in the dev tools you can click the checkbox next to css parts to disable/enable them
[15:08:59] <PuruPuru> yes, i'm slower
[15:09:02] <taplar> easy way to identify it
[15:09:35] <taplar> dev tools are hawt!
[15:10:16] <taplar> it's like they're tools for developers or some such shit
[15:12:44] <PuruPuru> taplar, holy shit
[15:13:08] <taplar> straight up yo
[15:13:23] <PuruPuru> taplar, i think i coulda deactivated that stuff from this inspect element thingy
[15:13:33] <taplar> that's what i'm saying
[15:13:34] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[15:13:41] <robertmaxrees> he literally just said that.
[15:14:00] * taplar reflects on the slow statement
[15:14:02] <taplar> no offense
[15:14:10] * awkwardCough 
[15:14:10] <PuruPuru> taplar, nah i was just kidding
[15:14:23] <PuruPuru> taplar, yeah i saw what u wrote, thanks for the tip
[15:14:43] <NoiseEee> omg awkwardCough just had their perfect moment
[15:14:49] <taplar> :D
[15:15:05] <robertmaxrees> taplar, was that you?
[15:15:07] <PuruPuru> how do you do these irc things?
[15:15:10] <taplar> my pair partner
[15:15:14] <robertmaxrees> yessss
[15:15:17] <taplar> he likes to read over my sholder
[15:15:21] <robertmaxrees> taplar ++++
[15:16:22] <robertmaxrees> taplar'scoworker ++++
[15:18:54] <PuruPuru> so how do you do the fancy IRC commands?
[15:19:02] <taplar> which ones?
[15:19:19] <taplar> ./me <stuff> will do the * things, just leave off the .
[15:19:49] * PuruPuru <stuffs>
[15:20:52] <PuruPuru> irc so hard 2 use
[15:21:07] <taplar> foooooo shizle
[15:21:31] <taplar> dang, now it's a competition to get another cough
[15:22:07] <Uhkis> /me thinks irc is too hard
[15:22:11] <Uhkis> doesnt even work!
[15:22:23] <PuruPuru> /me maybe you escaped it?
[15:22:30] <taplar> that just means you don't know who you are
[15:22:53] <Uhkis> oh no, identity problems
[15:43:39] <PuruPuru> taplar, holy shit
[15:43:46] <PuruPuru> taplar, that tool is so useful
[15:44:03] <taplar> that's what she said
[15:44:18] <PuruPuru> taplar, i had to keep uploading images every time I made a change in the javascript that adds that stuff
[15:44:37] <PuruPuru> taplar, and I would run out of images to upload, because i got unique constraint in DB
[15:44:54] <PuruPuru> taplar, but now i can just make the change and see it as well
[15:45:04] <PuruPuru> taplar, this stuff is life-changing
[15:45:16] <arc_> compared to not knowing about it, definitely
[15:55:22] <SmashingX> How can I remove an icon from a button?
[15:55:45] <roadRunner_11033> what kind of button?
[15:56:27] <SmashingX> collapsible
[15:57:23] <roadRunner_11033> SmashingX, native button? jquery ui?
[15:57:49] <SmashingX> native button
[15:59:46] <SmashingX> https://jsfiddle.net/vmqhzk5k/
[16:00:00] <SmashingX> I was wondering if I can do it without using CSS
[16:01:41] <roadRunner_11033> SmashingX,sorry, i am no jquery ui mobile CSS expert :(
[16:01:49] <nsosa> Hi all
[16:01:55] <nsosa> I'm trying to reset a form with jquery
[16:01:58] <nsosa> and nothing is happening
[16:02:09] <nsosa> how can I troubleshoot if it works or not
[16:02:12] <roadRunner_11033> you should inspect the element to find the css class, SmashingX
[16:02:42] <roadRunner_11033> SmashingX, in firefox for example.
[16:03:52] <roadRunner_11033> SmashingX, the heading has the class .ui-icon-plus set for the icon.
[16:06:04] <SmashingX> I found it
[16:06:24] <SmashingX> pretty simple
[16:06:25] <SmashingX> data-collapsed-icon="false"
[16:07:41] <roadRunner_11033> yeha, great :)
[16:10:54] <SmashingX> hey do you know if I can make a collapsible non-clickable
[16:11:40] <zye> If anyone has a moment I could use a little help.
[16:13:12] <taplar> what's the q dude?
[16:14:29] <zye> I have no experience using jquery, but I recently decided to try and use a plugin on my personal site
[16:16:12] <zye> It works alright via localhost but once I put it on the web the plugin does not function.
[16:16:54] <taplar> any errors in your console?
[16:18:06] <zye> Yeah, but I'm not really sure what they mean.
[16:19:04] <zye> uncaught error: the item ratio not inited yet
[16:23:05] <taplar> what plugin are you using?
[16:23:24] <zye> unite gallery
[16:25:27] <taplar> can you put what your trying in a fiddle?
[16:28:53] <zye> give me a sec
[16:32:02] <zye> I'm not sure
[16:32:31] <zye> I need certain .js files not available on fiddle I don't think.
[16:33:15] <taplar> you can include them in the external resources on the left hand side if you can find them in a CDN or you can use rawgit to link to them if they are in git
[16:39:15] <zye> sorry i am quite slow
[16:39:30] <zye> i am new to trying to replicate something like this in this fashion
[16:52:12] <zye> so when i add an external package
[16:53:02] <zye> i can get that uri from the git page that the plugin is hosted on
[16:53:23] <zye> then i should just be able to call it in the js section in fiddle
[16:53:36] <zye> ?
[16:54:25] <taplar> if it's a git url, you'll have to stick it in rawgit.com and put the url it gives you in the external resources
[16:54:41] <taplar> you can't directly link from github
[16:56:46] <rubyonrailed> When my value == false, it will not uncheck my checkbox.  But when I manually do it through debugger it works.  Does anyone have any idea why this could be happening? https://gist.github.com/JasonMannon/fbb33146efe0b803924a
[16:59:29] <shoky> rubyonrailed make a fiddle/testcase
[17:03:35] <taplar> heh, side note, your second function could just return (text == "ON"), ;)
[17:08:15] <dvasquez__> hello
[17:08:19] <taplar> also instead of an each it would seem like you could just use filter for the id
[17:08:24] <taplar> aloha
[17:08:59] <dvasquez__> does anyone know a good way to detect scrolling on a page?
[17:09:14] <dvasquez__> I specifically need to know when I'm on the top of the page
[17:09:14] <taplar> you can bind a scroll event handler to an element
[17:09:18] <dvasquez__> and when not
[17:09:36] <dvasquez__> ah ok so bind it to the main window
[17:09:48] <taplar> document or body
[17:10:02] <taplar> and check the scrollTop
[17:10:50] <taplar> cache any dom lookups you want to use in the handler so your not slowing yourself down with those
[17:11:13] <taplar> err, that read weird.  cache them outside the handler and use them inside
[17:12:02] <dvasquez__> taplar: ok thanx dude
[17:12:07] <PaulNewman> Hey everyone.
[17:12:24] <taplar> kon'nichiwa
[17:12:27] <dvasquez__> Newman...
[17:12:46] <PaulNewman> I sense a Seinfeld joke in the vicinity.
[17:12:50] <dvasquez__> haha indeed
[17:12:56] <dvasquez__> I'll leave it at that
[17:13:13] <PaulNewman> Hey, quick question: What's the issue with "this.source is not a function"?
[17:13:22] <taplar> what is 'this'?
[17:13:37] <PaulNewman> SO has a few posts on it but I am very green in jquery.
[17:14:20] <PaulNewman> taplar: I don't know. I'm using Autocomplete (https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/)
[17:14:24] <taplar> 'this' changes depending on context.  your most likely thinking it is something it is not, and the thing that it is, does not have a function of source
[17:14:48] <PaulNewman> I can get it to work with my dummy data but I'm trying to pull data from a Google Sheet (confession: I'm working in Google Apps Script)
[17:15:13] <taplar> immediately before you try to use it, console.log(this) to see what it actually is
[17:15:23] <PaulNewman> (GAS plays nicely with jquery, btw. I was pleasantly surprised.)
[17:16:44] <PaulNewman> "this.source=function(t,n)" from e.widget._search
[17:19:06] <PaulNewman> oh, I see. "this" came from a UserObject getting passed but it was copy-pasted from another call that actually HAD a real "this"
[17:19:59] <PaulNewman> I had an onclick for a test button (it will eventually run on .ready) but I commented out the button and the "this.source" error went away.
[17:20:33] <taplar> cool
[17:21:38] <PaulNewman> Haha. I don't really mind if something I don't want to keep doesn't work.
[17:22:02] <taplar> important to know why it didn't work though, :)
[17:22:56] <PaulNewman> True. I'm curious, but I think the "this" was simply undefined.
[17:23:13] <PaulNewman> I don't know why it was complaining about a function though.
[17:23:39] <taplar> 'this' is defined for any function
[17:24:03] <taplar> if you set the context though it will be whatever you told it to be however
[17:24:41] <taplar> most jquery methods will set the 'this' to be whatever the function is acting on
[17:25:22] <taplar> you can do it yourself though by using call()
[17:27:37] <PaulNewman> Thanks for the insight. That doesn't quite make sense yet, but I'll chew on it.
[17:28:17] <oompahlumpa> was wondering if someone might be able ot help me out
[17:28:34] <taplar> oompahlumpa: let'er rip
[17:28:43] <oompahlumpa> I am using this blazy.js script and I am trying to get it to load images 1 after another not at the same time
[17:28:57] <oompahlumpa> if the images are inline the load at the same time
[17:29:04] <oompahlumpa> instead of 1 after the other
[17:29:10] <robertmaxrees> why would you want that?
[17:29:13] <oompahlumpa> the code I am using to call is:
[17:29:16] <oompahlumpa> var bLazy = new Blazy({              success: function(newElements){         $(newElements).each(function(index, newElements) {           $(newElements).css('opacity') = '1';         });             }                 });
[17:29:25] <robertmaxrees> not in the channel btw.
[17:29:31] <robertmaxrees> and why do you want them to load in order?
[17:29:35] <robertmaxrees> why not just show them in order?
[17:29:45] <oompahlumpa> I do want them to show in order
[17:29:59] <oompahlumpa> but with a delay between them
[17:30:34] <taplar> PaulNewman: https://jsfiddle.net/f54juwkw/
[17:32:38] <taplar> if i can read that paste, it looks like your doing css('opacity') = '1'
[17:32:48] <taplar> setting would be css('opacity', '1')
[17:32:52] <oompahlumpa> exactly
[17:33:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah, need to pass it as an arg.
[17:33:17] <oompahlumpa> can you help me out with that robert?
[17:33:24] <robertmaxrees> he literally just did it.
[17:33:32] <robertmaxrees> <taplar> setting would be css('opacity', '1')
[17:33:32] <taplar> collaboration
[17:33:36] <robertmaxrees> taplar hahahaha
[17:33:44] <oompahlumpa> sorry I missed that
[17:34:16] <PaulNewman> Thanks, taplar.
[17:34:23] <taplar> sure
[17:36:17] <taplar> also you don't have to do that
[17:36:38] <taplar> you don't need the each
[17:36:40] <oompahlumpa> that doesnt work either
[17:37:18] <taplar> inspect your elements.  make sure the inline style is being added
[17:37:25] <taplar> also check that there is nothing overriding it
[17:37:48] <robertmaxrees> oompahlumpa you're aware $(newElements).each( will just go through all the elements and change things immediately right?
[17:38:25] <taplar> oh, i get what he's trying to do lol
[17:38:41] <taplar> i take it an opacity 0 image doesn't load?
[17:38:44] <robertmaxrees> you need some kind of timeOut or other way to put in a delay.
[17:38:53] <robertmaxrees> he just wants them to display in oirder.
[17:39:20] <oompahlumpa> yes as the bloaded is applied the load one after another
[17:39:28] <oompahlumpa> the bloaded is applying to everything in view
[17:39:31] <oompahlumpa> but I want them to chain in
[17:39:53] <taplar> egh
[17:42:10] <taplar> think i found the docs.  how do you tell it what images to lazy load?
[17:42:57] <taplar> ah, i c
[17:43:21] <taplar> so are you already giving all the images to blazy?
[17:44:11] <taplar> cause if i'm reading this right, if you are then they're all loading up front
[17:44:31] <robertmaxrees> he doesn't want them to load in order, he wants to make them show up in order.
[17:44:36] <robertmaxrees> like, set opacity on them in order.
[17:44:42] <robertmaxrees> but he wants a delay between each one.
[17:45:14] <taplar> ah
[17:45:34] <robertmaxrees> could use function that starts a setTimeout call with some kind of additive thing going on.  so your base is 200ms, increment by 200 for each element.
[17:46:55] <taplar> what about an animate with a series of tacked on then() calls?
[17:47:05] <robertmaxrees> sure, that works.
[17:47:14] <robertmaxrees> tons of ways to do it.
[17:50:55] <taplar> 10 more mins.  can't be over fast enough
[17:51:02] <robertmaxrees> i hear that.
[17:52:07] <oompahlumpa> this is driving me nuts.   The script is doing what it's suposed to by loading the class as it comes in view but the problem is there are sometimes multiple images in view so the class is loaded to each and they are all opacity 1 at the same time :-\
[17:52:25] <robertmaxrees> we explained how to fix that.
[17:52:31] <robertmaxrees> though that sounds like a strange UX.
[17:52:51] <oompahlumpa> ya I think what you guys said is unfortunately a little above me
[17:52:58] <robertmaxrees> so where are you lost?
[17:59:01] <tref> is there any official documentation on the specifics of events like ready, page:change and page:load ?
[17:59:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:59:14] <robertmaxrees> for jquery mobile you mean?
[18:00:30] <tref> robertmaxrees: well obv you know document.on([events])
[18:00:38] <robertmaxrees> sure./
[18:00:40] <tref> Im looking for documentation on [events]
[18:00:41] <robertmaxrees> what's the context?
[18:01:24] <tref> Im working on a rails app which uses turbolinks and “ready” doesnt always fire because of the way pjax operates
[18:01:39] <tref> robertmaxrees: I’m just trying to find something official describing these events
[18:01:59] <tref> this is the first time I’ve thought about how these events work
[18:02:37] <tref> I’m guessing that these page:change and page:load events are being called by rails turbolinks library
[18:02:38] <robertmaxrees> you'd look at the turbolinks docs for that.
[18:02:44] <robertmaxrees> those are being emitted by turbolinks.
[18:02:53] <robertmaxrees> jquery just subscribes to them.
[18:05:19] <taplar> awww, oompah left
[18:05:58] <taplar> anyway, have a good weekend all

[19:09:59] <Shai-Tan> If I have a <button id="foo">Foo</button> What selector is required for this button? eg button:#foo ?
[19:10:08] <robertmaxrees> #foo
[19:10:11] <robertmaxrees> ids are unique.
[19:10:14] <robertmaxrees> so you just use the ID.
[19:10:22] <robertmaxrees> same as in css.
[19:10:27] <Shai-Tan> ok, thanks

[21:14:17] <Mark__> is anyone familiar with the jquery tab ui? i need to create chrome browser like tab UI, that gives each tab a unnique class name so that it don’t reopen once it gets opened. http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/ help me out please?
[21:28:29] <Shai-Tan> If I am making a table with data requested via ajax, am I best to get html back from the server? or get json back from the server and use js to convert to html?
[21:53:19] <ajnr> Hi I would like to know how to show "loading ...." while clicking on a web link, this is my simple php code , http://pastebin.com/KN7K6qhM and jquery code , please help me http://pastebin.com/nZizBLEh
[21:53:54] <Mark__> well,
[21:54:02] <Mark__> im not an expert
[21:54:16] <Mark__> but you could use simple codes to make the preloader show and hide.
[21:55:01] <Mark__> try something like this jQuery(window).load(function() { jQuery('.page-loader').fadeOut(600); });
[21:55:18] <Mark__> first you need to insert the spinner into your html page,
[21:55:26] <Mark__> and then you can hide once it’s done loading.
[21:55:29] <Mark__> do you follow me?
[21:56:08] <ajnr> Mark__, actually I am not able to linkup the two pages,
[21:56:25] <ajnr> both links are in two separate page
[21:56:43] <ajnr> one is .php file and another is .js file
[21:56:46] <Mark__> i have no understanding of what you are trying to do.
[21:57:12] <Mark__> oh i see.
[21:57:17] <Mark__> so you are not loading the page actually,
[21:57:26] <Mark__> you are just wanting to show the spinner for a click
[21:57:34] <ajnr> I am trying to do to show "loading ...." while clicking on a web link in the index.php which is given here http://pastebin.com/KN7K6qhM
[21:57:48] <Mark__> i believe there was a simple js plugin for this
[21:57:54] <Mark__> can’t remember which one it was though
[21:58:10] <Mark__> but it used ajax function
[21:59:26] <ajnr> hmm
[22:41:15] <ajnr> Hi with this code http://pastebin.com/Qw77P9n6 I am trying to redirect to another page after clicking on the "add" button and then shows the please wait while loading the web page. but I am not getting the output, what I got is http://screenshot.co/#!/84fae1d60d , any one please
[22:48:40] <dbclk> folks...i'm using this ->  $.ajax({                     url: '@Url.Action("Emailing","GetStates")',                     data: ko.toJSON(self.SelectedCountry()),                     type:"get",                     success: function (data) {                         self.SearchParam.States.removeAll();                         self.SearchParam.Customers.removeAll();                         ko.utils.arrayPushAll(self.SearchParam.States, data.States);

[22:49:29] <dbclk> not an object
[22:49:32] <dbclk> any ideas?
[22:50:23] <dbclk> hell
[22:50:26] <dbclk> hello*
