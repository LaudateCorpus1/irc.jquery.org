[04:08:05] <`ULT> Hello, I have a problem with jquery. with .html(" ") I add some html code in an existing <p>
[04:08:15] <`ULT> This is working correct in this fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/4aeztk07/
[04:08:32] <`ULT> I use exact this line in my real site, and than I get another result.
[04:09:35] <`ULT> the strong tags are not only aplied on vandaag (<strong>vandaag</strong> but on the whole sentence <strong>Vandaag geopend ....... </strong>
[04:09:48] <`ULT> I can figure out why this is happening
[04:09:52] <`ULT> can`t
[04:16:27] <Cork> `ULT: make sure you have </strong> and not <strong>
[04:34:34] <`ULT> yes Cork, that is correct
[04:34:43] <`ULT> It is the exact line I posted in the fiddle
[04:35:05] <Cork> `ULT: you would have to provide a link to a live example where it doesn't work then
[04:35:28] <`ULT> Intead of <strong> I tried <span class=" ">vandaag</span>
[04:35:43] <`ULT> and that was giving the same result, <span>full sentence</span>
[04:35:58] <`ULT> Yes, may I PM you the live example?
[04:36:09] <Cork> sure
[04:36:20] <`ULT> thank you.
[05:04:11] <stennowork> good day, assuming i have, say, a bunch of LI's in an UL. if i click one of the LI's, how can i figure out which nth-child it is?
[05:06:15] <Cork> stennowork: $(this).closest('ul').children().index(this)
[05:06:30] <stennowork> ah .index()
[05:06:31] <stennowork> thanks
[05:06:36] <stennowork> thats a bit clunky
[05:06:37] <Cork> hmm actually, there is a short hand
[05:06:41] <Cork> so just $(this).index()
[05:06:45] <Cork> it does the same thing
[05:06:49] <stennowork> ah great
[05:06:51] <stennowork> thanks a lot
[05:06:53] <Cork> np
[05:58:58] <emilkarl> Any ideas how to prevent click on .item to show .containers tooltip? http://jsfiddle.net/fvubppfq/33/
[05:59:03] <emilkarl> using $.tooltipster
[06:01:09] <Cork> emilkarl: you would prob have to bind your own event handlers and not sure the plugins one at all
[06:01:16] <Cork> and instead call the open method
[06:01:25] <Cork> (though i don't use the plugin so might be missing something)
[06:01:38] <emilkarl> hmm k :|
[06:01:44] <emilkarl> that might be it
[07:27:40] <andywww> simple question, if i were to want to fire an on click event on a link, how would I go about doing this? I want the link to work as normal but i want to trigger a tracking function before it goes through
[07:28:56] <andywww> is it as simple as https://gist.github.com/anonymous/22eb803064ffd968139c823b807d5ba6?
[07:29:48] <stennowork> andywww, yes, i think not even the 'return true' is required
[07:30:27] <stennowork> i am not sure though if your callback fires before or after the 'normal' behaviour
[07:45:35] <andywww> thank you!
[08:04:18] <dglambert> yo
[09:55:56] <Kingsy> I am trying to get the currently active element with --> console.log($(document.activeElement)); <-- but it always seems to return the body.. even when I have an inpuit selected.
[09:56:11] <Kingsy> I could use $(":focus") but IO cant get the element from what.
[10:02:26] <MikeD_> why are the $.each() and $.map() signatures backwards from each other?
[10:02:50] <MikeD_> even when I know they're not what I think, I still use the wrong parameter order (duh)
[10:14:19] <shoky_> MikeD_: no good reason, historical mistakes, etc ;p
[10:14:45] <MikeD_> haha, at least there's a reason
[10:15:12] <shoky_> fortunately we don't have to use $.each or $.map anymore
[10:30:51] <MikeD_> wut?
[10:43:45] <shoky_> MikeD_: native js has .each and .map
[10:43:49] <shoky_> on arrays
[10:50:10] <MikeD_> So you advise returning to native array methods in whatever code is being written
[10:54:33] <shoky_> instead of $.each(array  or $.map(array   yeah definitely
[11:42:56] <noobiewan> hey guys, how would I go about serializing and array created with serializeArray() ? I want to modify some form data before using serializing so I thought about using serializeArray, modifying what I need and then serializing it back. But .serialize only works for forms
[11:45:14] <runningbread> hey everyone im having trouble with subsequent ajax calls. here's my snippet: https://gist.github.com/muratsu/3a0e19d777ec9e330ef4f0589aa6ba9b
[11:45:14] <runningbread> both chrome and safari is having trouble with the second ajax call giving an error -> "rejecting the connection"
[11:45:14] <runningbread> if i increase the setTimeout from 1s to 5s, it starts working. i suspect im trying to do another request before the first one actually ends but i'm not entirely sure. anyone has any pointers?
[11:45:49] <shoky_> noobiewan: what do you mean by "serialize it back" ?  it's already serialized
[11:46:10] <noobiewan> serialize it back the way serialize() does, for the query string
[11:46:15] <shoky_> noobiewan: you can just pass that array as 'data' to $.ajax
[11:46:36] <noobiewan> there is a method that takes a serialized string, and I didn't want to touch it
[11:46:51] <noobiewan> so I wanted to get the array and serialize it as a query string
[11:46:56] <shoky_> why not touch it?
[11:47:16] <shoky_> anyways you want $.param then
[11:47:22] <shoky_> i think
[11:48:22] <duch_kazatel> also: you don;'t want timeouts, you want recursion
[11:49:10] <shoky_> also? did your first message not send
[11:49:30] <runningbread> i think it was to me? :)
[11:50:02] <duch_kazatel> ohshi-
[11:50:03] <shoky_> me too, just the 'also' confused me
[11:50:03] <duch_kazatel> hah
[11:50:11] <duch_kazatel> i was tagging on to what shoky was saying.
[11:50:18] <duch_kazatel> totally didn't even realizew it was two people.
[11:50:21] <duch_kazatel> derp.
[11:50:22] <shoky_> heh
[11:50:25] <runningbread> :)
[11:51:32] <runningbread> timeout does make sense in my case but i dont understand why the first ajax call isn't properly finished on "done"
[11:52:09] <duch_kazatel> wow i really should actually read the code next time.  that was my bad.
[11:52:51] <shoky_> runningbread: "rejecting the connection"? where do you see that, what's the exact error
[11:53:11] <runningbread> net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
[11:53:45] <runningbread> also status: 0 & statusText: "error"
[11:54:08] <runningbread> which implies it's either CORS or a client side issue. but it's not CORS im sure
[11:54:20] <shoky_> ad blocker?
[11:54:35] <duch_kazatel> and are you on the same port, protocol, and domain?
[11:54:37] <duch_kazatel> all three gotta math.
[11:54:39] <duch_kazatel> *match
[11:54:57] <runningbread> ypu. increasing the timeout to 5s makes it work
[11:55:01] <runningbread> let me check on the adblocker
[11:55:05] <duch_kazatel> that's really strange.
[11:55:37] <runningbread> nop adblock didnt help either
[11:55:53] <duch_kazatel> is it your own server?
[11:56:08] <runningbread> yes
[11:56:23] <duch_kazatel> Does the box lag out or something after the request is done?
[11:57:03] <runningbread> this is happenign on my dev box. i highly doubt that's the case
[11:57:29] <duch_kazatel> what happens if you make the request manually and fire a second quickly after the first has finished?
[11:58:22] <runningbread> i can't really do as fast as js but it does always work when i spam on postman
[11:58:30] <duch_kazatel> weird.
[11:58:52] <runningbread> the thing is
[11:59:01] <runningbread> it's not even making the call to the server
[11:59:13] <runningbread> i get connection_refused on chrome
[11:59:21] <runningbread> and i dont see the request on express
[11:59:23] <runningbread> logs
[11:59:41] <kaynw80> is there a seperate channel for bootstrap related questions?
[11:59:55] <duch_kazatel> kaynw80 ##bootstrap i think.
[12:00:04] <duch_kazatel> runningbread hrm...
[12:00:17] <runningbread> so either the browser is not ready to make the call or some weird security measure is blocking me
[12:00:25] <duch_kazatel> runningbread firewall?
[12:00:33] <kaynw80> duch_kazatel thanks!
[12:01:15] <runningbread> dunno if that's the case.. i thought it was a chrome bug or something
[12:01:21] <runningbread> but safari is behaving the same
[12:01:24] <duch_kazatel> heh.
[12:01:27] <duch_kazatel> that sounds like a firewall.
[12:01:33] <shoky_> runningbread what's the actual url?
[12:01:48] <runningbread> it's not live
[12:01:53] <shoky_> that's fine
[12:02:02] <shoky_> question still stands ;p
[12:02:59] <runningbread> http://localhost:3000/demo
[12:02:59] <runningbread> the first request is a post to the same URL.
[12:02:59] <runningbread> the second request is a post to http://localhost:3000/subscriptions/foo/:id
[12:05:19] <shoky_> tried in incognito mode?
[12:05:27] <shoky_> no extensions
[12:05:28] <runningbread> letme
[12:06:16] <runningbread> jquery.js:5 POST http://localhost:3000/subscriptions/foo/1482426340281 net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
[12:06:25] <runningbread> this is so frustrating lol
[12:06:28] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[12:06:35] <duch_kazatel> look at your av/firewall.
[12:07:38] <runningbread> well it's off :/
[12:09:23] <runningbread> maybe i should be chaining on then instead of done
[12:10:02] <shoky_> that wouldn't cause a connection refused ;p
[12:11:47] <duch_kazatel> a firewall?
[12:11:48] <duch_kazatel> sure it would.
[12:11:58] <shoky_> no, what he said last
[12:12:02] <duch_kazatel> oh.
[12:12:03] <shoky_> then/done
[12:12:04] <duch_kazatel> heh
[12:12:27] <duch_kazatel> .then() just uses .done/.catch under the hood doesn't it?
[12:12:31] <duch_kazatel> or vice versa?
[12:13:49] <shoky_> haven't looked at the jquery 3 changes yet, donno really. it used to be that way at least, i think, ya
[12:17:25] <bumblebee> Could anyone please show me how to access the history of this channel?
[12:17:48] <shoky_> bumblebee: http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/
[12:18:04] <runningbread> so i ran wireshark on loopback channel
[12:18:21] <runningbread> i see the first ajax call. server responds back with http200
[12:18:29] <runningbread> the second call is not made
[12:19:01] <runningbread> so it's getting blocked before it reaches to server
[12:19:09] <minikN> Hello. I'm using the jQuery validate plugin to check the mime type of my file input. On line 20 it returns true even if I select a wrong file. Would anyone know why? https://jsfiddle.net/38swkfw2/
[12:19:15] <runningbread> heck, before the ethernet even
[12:19:23] <runningbread> meaning the browser is blocking it
[12:19:35] <runningbread> both safari and chrome are doing the same
[12:19:42] <runningbread> so it's not plugins
[12:19:57] <shoky_> or the firewall is ;s
[12:20:10] <runningbread> the mac firewall is off
[12:20:18] <runningbread> but true :)
[12:20:36] <shoky_> sure your server app stays up after the first request?
[12:20:50] <shoky_> maybe it crashes and takes a second to go back up :S
[12:21:26] <runningbread> the post request is not made
[12:21:29] <shoky_> or stops listening for a bit for some reason
[12:21:36] <runningbread> i would see it on wireshark
[12:22:10] <runningbread> the call is blocked before it reaches loopback
[12:22:37] <shoky_> so you dont want to check what i asked, ok ;)
[12:22:50] <runningbread> dont get me wrong i did
[12:22:55] <runningbread> just to make sure
[12:23:10] <runningbread> :)
[12:23:20] <shoky_> cool. don't get me wrong, i trust that wireshark is probably right and that you're probably reading it right
[12:23:25] <shoky_> but that's just probably :)
[12:24:05] <runningbread> i know no worries
[12:24:10] <shoky_> try firefox? ¯\(°_o)/¯
[12:25:17] <shoky_> or i donno, share your server + client code :)
[12:35:11] <minikN> shoky_ sorry for bothering, would you be able to help me?
[12:46:36] <shoky_> minikN: seems to work fine  https://jsfiddle.net/38swkfw2/1/
[12:47:18] <shoky_> you need the additional-methods js too..
[12:47:28] <minikN> I got the additional methods yes.
[12:47:46] <shoky_> well it works fine
[12:47:58] <minikN> That's strange.. because for me it doesn't..
[12:48:01] <duch_kazatel> minikN and you're including everything in the right order on your site?
[12:48:05] <duch_kazatel> and no console errors, too?
[12:51:56] <minikN> Well I do console.log($('#file').valid());
[12:52:02] <minikN> and it outputs true every time
[12:52:13] <duch_kazatel> that's... not what i asked :)
[12:52:13] <minikN> if I select a wrong mime type or if I don't select a file at all
[12:52:15] <minikN> still true
[12:52:24] <minikN> Apart from that no errors no.
[12:52:45] <shoky_> minikN: did you give it  name="file" attribute too?
[12:53:11] <minikN> Yes.
[12:53:55] <shoky_> make a complete testcase.. reproduce the error on jsfiddle
[12:54:35] <minikN> Maybe this helps: http://laravel.io/bin/De23w
[12:59:22] <minikN> I don't get it -.-
[13:00:42] <duch_kazatel> remember when shoky said 'make a complete testcase'?
[13:04:30] <minikN> https://jsfiddle.net/38swkfw2/2/
[13:04:40] <minikN> I copied it directly
[13:05:31] <duch_kazatel> seems to work as intended here.
[13:07:08] <shoky_> minikN: i think the problem is when the input is invisible
[13:07:43] <runningbread> shoky_: well i've updated macos and bunch of stuff
[13:07:47] <runningbread> restarted the computer
[13:07:54] <runningbread> and it's working
[13:07:56] <runningbread> fml :D
[13:08:11] <shoky_> minikN:   use   ignore: []   option for .validate() if you want to validate hidden inputs
[13:08:25] <shoky_> minikN: jq validate ignores hidden inputs by default
[13:08:34] <duch_kazatel> hah!
[13:08:36] <shoky_> runningbread heh
[13:10:11] <shoky_> ref  https://jqueryvalidation.org/validate#ignore
[13:32:34] <SpecialTech> heyo - shoky_ are you familiar with react?
[13:38:56] <duch_kazatel> SpecialTech lol
[13:39:30] <SpecialTech> duch_kazatel? I'm looking for a jquery solution to a react frontend
[13:39:37] <duch_kazatel> erm
[13:39:45] <duch_kazatel> why not juse use react?
[13:43:35] <duch_kazatel> (shrug) welp
[13:45:01] <SpecialTech> duch_kazatel sorry, well its a bit more complicated, but i technically need a solution where jquery listens to dom changes and localstorage changes
[13:45:34] <duch_kazatel> i'm confused here - why are you using jquery if you have react?
[13:45:37] <SpecialTech> two different frontends that need to be tied
[13:45:57] <duch_kazatel> ag.
[13:46:10] <duch_kazatel> so listening to dom changes is a scary proposition.
[13:46:19] <SpecialTech> I just took on a project, we're currently working on re-writing the jquery stuff, but I need a bandaid for now.
[13:46:28] <SpecialTech> I can go with just listening for localstorage changes
[13:46:40] <duch_kazatel> fwiw http://stackoverflow.com/q/4671852/923919
[13:58:55] <SpecialTech> duch_kazatel: reading the mozilla docs for window.addEventListener('storage') and it says it won't work on the same page that is making the changes.
[14:01:15] <SpecialTech> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26974084/listen-for-changes-with-localstorage-on-the-same-window - I found this, but not in jquery !_!
[14:01:30] <duch_kazatel> why not use vanilla js?
[14:15:45] <SpecialTech> duch_kazatel - what is considered "arguments" in the so link?
[14:16:19] <duch_kazatel> arguments is a special object inside of functions that contains everything passed to the function.
[14:16:41] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments
[14:23:05] <SpecialTech> duch_kazatel: it seems that initEvent has been deprecated T_T
[14:24:01] <duch_kazatel> (shrug)
[14:28:51] <Deusdeorum> how can i find closest class if the class is either 'another-class-1', 'another-class-2' or 'another-class-3', i'd like to use find but only parts of class name $(this).closest(".class").find(".another-class-??")
[14:29:20] <duch_kazatel> you select on all three...
[14:29:43] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you need a generic 'another-class' and then a data attribute with that number storedin it.
[14:29:48] <duch_kazatel> *sotred
[14:29:54] <duch_kazatel> ffff you know what i mean.
[14:32:13] <Deusdeorum> select all three on a closest?
[14:32:17] <Deusdeorum> they all exist
[14:32:18] <Deusdeorum> on the page
[14:32:19] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:32:46] <duch_kazatel> so you want the closest if it's one of those three classes?
[14:32:56] <duch_kazatel> .closest(''another-class-1',
[14:32:56] <duch_kazatel> 'another-class-2' or 'another-class-3'
[14:33:04] <duch_kazatel> woops - one sec
[14:33:26] <duch_kazatel>  .closest('another-class-1, another-class-2, another-class-3')
[14:33:27] <duch_kazatel> there.
[14:33:33] <Deusdeorum> yup, they all exist on the page but i want the closest one, and it can either be one iof these classes
[14:33:44] <duch_kazatel> yeah, look at what i just pasted?
[14:34:08] <Deusdeorum> will try, but will it actually select the one being closest?
[14:34:19] <duch_kazatel> do you understand what that method does?
[14:34:33] <duch_kazatel> because it sounds like you think it does something it doesn't actually do.
[14:35:27] <Deusdeorum> not sure though, i pasted $(this).closest(".class").find(".another-class-??")
[14:35:31] <duch_kazatel> ...
[14:35:35] <Deusdeorum> 'class' is not dynamic
[14:35:40] <Deusdeorum> which is the closest
[14:35:41] <duch_kazatel> so what do you think .closest() does?
[14:36:10] <Deusdeorum> select closest
[14:36:16] <duch_kazatel> lopl
[14:36:17] <duch_kazatel> lol
[14:36:20] <duch_kazatel> define "closest"
[14:36:38] <Deusdeorum> this is in a click function, closest being closest to the click
[14:36:42] <duch_kazatel> lol
[14:36:45] <duch_kazatel> you're not listening.
[14:37:19] <duch_kazatel> either way, it finds the first elemenet that matches your selector, starting at the current element and going through all ancestors.
[14:37:43] <Deusdeorum> yup
[14:37:46] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[14:37:57] <duch_kazatel> so when where are you confused?
[14:38:27] <duch_kazatel> *then
[14:39:05] <Deusdeorum> not sure if we are talking around each other
[14:39:28] <duch_kazatel> " how can i find closest class if the class is either 'another-class-1', 'another-class-2' or 'another-class-3'"
[14:39:35] <duch_kazatel>  .closest('another-class-1, another-class-2, another-class-3')
[14:39:36] <MikeD_> if they had named it "me_and_my_ancestors" then you'd not have this problem
[14:39:55] <duch_kazatel> alternatively, use a generic classname instead and stick the number in a data attribute.
[14:39:57] <Deusdeorum> okey i explained that bad
[14:40:12] <duch_kazatel> you think you want what's called a partial attribute selector.
[14:40:37] <Deusdeorum> i need to find the closest div, with a class 'class'.  $(this).closest(".class").find(".another-class-??") in that div there's a dynamic div that has the class 'another-class-1' -> 3
[14:41:04] <duch_kazatel> then .find('another-class-1, another-class-2, another-class-3');
[14:41:06] <duch_kazatel> off that closest
[14:41:09] <MikeD_> i think if you don't make a fiddle to show a simplified test, you're never going to get a clear picture (and neither are we)
[14:41:12] <duch_kazatel> it's a selector.
[14:41:40] <Deusdeorum> thank you
[14:43:02] <Deusdeorum> i wasn't aware of .find('another-class-1, another-class-2, another-class-3');
[14:43:09] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[14:43:12] <duch_kazatel> it takes a selector.
[14:43:15] <duch_kazatel> so it works just like css.
[14:43:22] <duch_kazatel> and $()
[14:43:59] <Deusdeorum> being more of a python guy i did not catch that
[14:44:05] <duch_kazatel> heh
[14:44:10] <duch_kazatel> and now you know! :)
[14:44:14] <Deusdeorum> :-)
[14:44:16] <duch_kazatel> the learning center i think clarifies that too.
[16:15:45] <duch_kazatel> weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[16:25:01] <arc_> maybe someone can explain this to me
[16:25:09] <arc_> it feels like i'm taking crazy pills
[16:25:23] <duch_kazatel> we can try.
[16:25:36] <arc_> at several sites where you can order food online, like subway's site and hungry howie's site
[16:25:59] <arc_> it shows you the whole homepage, and there's a button at the top that says order online
[16:26:10] <arc_> when you click that, it takes you to another version of the homepage that has a link that says login
[16:26:21] <arc_> then you click that and it takes you to a login screen
[16:26:28] <arc_> what possible reason could there be for this
[16:26:43] <duch_kazatel> subway.com vs store.subway.com
[16:27:03] <arc_> but like ... why doesn't clicking order online just take you to the login screen if you're not already logged in
[16:27:17] <duch_kazatel> marketing.
[16:27:40] <arc_> do you have a specific explanation that i'm not grasping :p
[16:27:45] <duch_kazatel> it's really that stupid.
[16:27:48] <arc_> heh okay
[16:27:50] <duch_kazatel> they want you to see the order site's homepage.
[16:27:58] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, who knows?
[16:28:15] <duch_kazatel> maybe they don't want to integrate with whatever they're using for online ordering.
[16:28:22] <arc_> i guess
[16:28:27] <duch_kazatel> so they just link to that homepage to make life easy for themselves down the road.
[16:28:55] <arc_> yeah now that i think about the fact that they're probably using some third party tool for online ordering it makes a little more sense i guess ...
[16:29:23] <arc_> but at the worst i would just have a modal come up for login when you are taken to that page and aren't logged in
[16:29:25] <taplar> i wish sonic let you order online
[16:29:37] <duch_kazatel> arc_ not without special handling.
[16:29:40] <duch_kazatel> cross-domain
[16:30:29] <taplar> speaking of, i notice this morning that chrome has started blocking cross domain iframes
[16:30:55] <duch_kazatel> also: pci i'm guessing.
[16:31:07] <arc_> duch_kazatel i mean after it takes you to the online ordering page
[16:31:08] <duch_kazatel> yep - you can pay on order.
[16:31:25] <duch_kazatel> 5 bux also says PCI compliance comes into play.
[16:31:41] <taplar> CC information, sure
[16:31:45] <duch_kazatel> if it's not supplied by a third party, it's MUCH easier to maintain that as a separate codebase.
[16:31:57] <duch_kazatel> your cr/qa stuff doesn'
[16:32:04] <duch_kazatel> *doesn't have to slow down your marketing site.
[16:32:22] <arc_> okay, i hate the developers of these sites a little less now, thanks
[16:32:50] <duch_kazatel> fwiw my guess is third party.  calling it a "cart" is lol
[16:34:22] <arc_> hungry howies has a totally different problem though. you click order online and it has you select a location, instead of asking you to login, even though obviously it knows what your location is from your account info, THEN you get to a login screen, and after that you have to select a location again, even though it obviously knows what your location is -_-
[16:34:42] <arc_> or additional i guess, rather than different
[16:35:02] <duch_kazatel> have you tried logging in first?
[16:35:16] <arc_> there's no login button until you do the stuff i said lol
[16:35:28] <duch_kazatel> i'm not logged in and i see a login button.
[16:35:35] <duch_kazatel> on the homepage.
[16:35:36] <arc_> oh they fixed it?!
[16:35:40] <arc_> holy shit
[16:35:49] <arc_> i guess it's been a while since i used their site
[16:36:09] <taplar> i love how small it is
[16:36:18] <arc_> better than not existing :D
[16:40:44] <duch_kazatel> #boom
[16:47:54] <dglambert> night
[16:48:40] <duch_kazatel> day!
[17:03:56] <taplar> *sings* twiiiiiiliiiiiiight
[17:07:24] <Side_FX> Can someone tell me why POST data isn't transffering?   http://pastebin.com/sRYR2ciW
[17:08:06] <duch_kazatel> are you hitting your success block?
[17:08:32] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, check your network tab for the request.
[17:08:38] <taplar> the second one isn't a post
[17:08:55] <taplar> so no $_POST will exist
[17:09:04] <Side_FX> No...
[17:09:30] <Side_FX> On the second one I get success, but not on the first.
[17:09:40] <taplar> right, i was commenting towards your comment
[17:09:53] <taplar> "//This works but no $_POST items exist"
[17:10:02] <Side_FX> What am I missing to make it a post?
[17:10:09] <duch_kazatel> Side_FX look at your network tab.
[17:10:10] <taplar> method:"POST"
[17:10:13] <duch_kazatel> do you see a network request?
[17:10:15] <taplar> or type
[17:10:39] <duch_kazatel> i think you're conflating posting data with form data.
[17:10:59] <Side_FX> When I put Method:"POST" in it doesn't give me success
[17:11:08] <duch_kazatel> right.
[17:12:09] <Side_FX> I'm not sure what you mean by conflating poting data with form data..
[17:12:19] <duch_kazatel> look at your network tab.
[17:12:34] <duch_kazatel> fire a request.
[17:12:47] <duch_kazatel> open it in the network tab - look at the post body.  does it exist?
[17:13:22] <Side_FX> Getting a 405
[17:13:34] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[17:14:53] <Side_FX> Ooh
[17:15:12] <Side_FX> I'm in Laravel, I guess I have to create a seperate route for POST data specifically
[17:15:36] <taplar> what are you doing?  and are you trying to be restful?
[17:16:12] <Side_FX> Just trying to send off a fax to an API
[17:16:23] <Side_FX> with an API i should say
[17:16:28] <taplar> k, so post makes sense
[17:28:28] <aljone> guys, thats kills me : $("#calander-content,#checkout-calander-content,.employees-calander-content .scedule").find("[data-time='"+time+"'][data-date='"+date+"']").html(objectHTML);
[17:28:35] <aljone> ideas
[17:28:38] <taplar> classes
[17:28:40] <duch_kazatel> ^
[17:28:49] <duch_kazatel> better classes.
[17:29:00] <aljone> how better classes are in my case?
[17:29:17] <duch_kazatel> what do all of those elements have in common?
[17:29:30] <duch_kazatel> you're selecting 4 different things but filling them all with the same markup.
[17:29:38] <aljone> yes
[17:29:44] <aljone> the markups data-date and time
[17:29:55] <taplar> what do those things represent?
[17:29:58] <duch_kazatel> ^
[17:30:01] <aljone> divs
[17:30:05] <taplar> that's markup
[17:30:05] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:30:08] <taplar> think business terms
[17:30:09] <duch_kazatel> but what are they for?
[17:30:22] <duch_kazatel> "that's where i show employee date time.
[17:30:32] <aljone> yes example
[17:30:36] <duch_kazatel> ,,,
[17:30:40] <duch_kazatel> so is that what those hold?>
[17:30:42] <aljone> when i have update i want to update those cells html
[17:30:49] <taplar> but what are they?
[17:30:52] <aljone> divs
[17:30:54] <aljone> i dont get it
[17:30:54] <duch_kazatel> right, so what do they represent in business terms.
[17:31:16] <aljone> money lol
[17:31:19] <aljone> i dont know
[17:31:21] <duch_kazatel> "they're where employee date/time gets displayed" or something like that.
[17:31:26] <aljone> yes
[17:31:28] <aljone> example
[17:31:31] <duch_kazatel> is that what it is?
[17:31:33] <taplar> $('div').on('click', function(){...}); doesn't tell you anything
[17:31:37] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:31:42] <duch_kazatel> $('.employeeDateTime')
[17:31:45] <taplar> $('.login').on('click', validateCredentials);
[17:31:46] <duch_kazatel> that means something.
[17:31:50] <taplar> i know what that does
[17:31:59] <duch_kazatel> etc
[17:32:26] <aljone> hmm but $('.employeeDateTime') is example like i did like i have [data-date...
[17:32:32] <aljone> how diffrence does it make
[17:32:33] <duch_kazatel> no.
[17:32:39] <duch_kazatel> those are data attrubtes.
[17:32:43] <aljone> so
[17:32:45] <duch_kazatel> you should never select on those.
[17:32:52] <duch_kazatel> they're not made for that.  classes and ids are.
[17:32:53] <aljone> more memory?
[17:32:59] <duch_kazatel> get away from memory.
[17:33:15] <aljone> all i care is fast and resource consuming
[17:33:19] <duch_kazatel> but if you care about speed so much, attribute selectors are in fact slower.
[17:33:22] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:33:32] <aljone> ok
[17:33:33] <duch_kazatel> that;'s a terrible thing to care about.
[17:33:41] <aljone> what should i care about ?
[17:33:45] <duch_kazatel> readability.
[17:33:47] <duch_kazatel> optimize later.
[17:34:02] <aljone> for me i really want it faster
[17:34:07] <duch_kazatel> why?
[17:34:13] <duch_kazatel> why prematurely optimize?
[17:34:15] <aljone> right now its slowing my fucking code im trying to find the issue
[17:34:22] <duch_kazatel> then find the issue and fix it.
[17:34:28] <aljone> yeah im trying
[17:34:29] <aljone> ok
[17:34:29] <duch_kazatel> (shrug) tons of tools to do exactly that :)
[17:34:35] <aljone> like?
[17:34:43] <duch_kazatel> your browser's developer tools.
[17:34:46] <duch_kazatel> the profiler et al
[17:34:50] <aljone> ohh yes im using it actually
[17:35:10] <duch_kazatel> the timeline in chrome, too.
[17:35:13] <duch_kazatel> those help tons.
[17:35:23] <duch_kazatel> either way, use classes for selecting.
[17:35:32] <taplar> we used timeline in chrome a lot when performance tuning out site
[17:35:39] <taplar> out/our
[17:35:43] <duch_kazatel> it'
[17:35:47] <duch_kazatel> *it's a great tool.
[17:36:48] <aljone> yeah timeline is great
[17:37:21] <duch_kazatel> so instead of building an unusable codebase that you won't be able to work with later on, fix your per issues.
[17:37:29] <duch_kazatel> *perf
[18:01:19] <aljone> wow i nocied that splitting it to diffrent searchs is much faster
[18:01:20] <aljone> i mean
[18:01:26] <duch_kazatel> wut
[18:01:32] <aljone> instead of $("#calander-content,#checkout-calander-content,.employees-calander-content .scedule").find
[18:01:50] <aljone> make it $("#calander-content") ... $("#checkout-calander-content")...
[18:01:58] <aljone> faster
[18:02:04] <aljone> i wonder why
[18:02:08] <duch_kazatel> you should read up on selector performance.
[18:02:11] <duch_kazatel> and also:
[18:02:16] <duch_kazatel> you shouldn;'t need those in the first place.
[18:02:21] <duch_kazatel> use a good classname and you don't need that.
[18:02:51] <aljone> but searcing id and then class inside of it isnt faster then looking inside the entire dom for the class?
[18:03:03] <duch_kazatel> readability.
[18:03:08] <taplar> getElementsByClassName() is super fast
[18:03:16] <duch_kazatel> also that.
[18:03:25] <aljone> i do have good lcass name like CalDateTime2016-12-22_02-02
[18:03:31] <taplar> lol
[18:03:40] * duch_kazatel bangs head against the wall.
[18:03:49] <duch_kazatel> class names should be generic.
[18:03:49] <aljone> isnt it good??!
[18:03:57] <duch_kazatel> "calDateTime"
[18:03:57] <taplar> 'calendar-content' could be a good one for your use case possibly
[18:03:58] <aljone> BUT i need specificc
[18:03:59] <duch_kazatel> that's a good classname.
[18:04:02] <duch_kazatel> no.
[18:04:04] <duch_kazatel> you don't.
[18:04:08] <aljone> because im replaceing specific ones
[18:04:09] <aljone> not all
[18:04:20] <taplar> only put it on the ones you want to set
[18:04:22] <aljone> as u rmember the one with the date/time
[18:04:34] <duch_kazatel> listen to taplar.
[18:04:35] <aljone> omg its dymanic changing ...
[18:04:55] <aljone> i have classes and then if somethin changing i need to find the changed div and replace its html
[18:04:55] <duch_kazatel> then use a generic class with data attributes.
[18:04:59] <aljone> i cant use generic
[18:05:08] <aljone> OMG thats what i did u told me its not good!
[18:05:15] <duch_kazatel> you weren't filtering.
[18:05:20] <duch_kazatel> you were using attribute selectors.
[18:05:23] <duch_kazatel> very different.
[18:05:28] <duch_kazatel> "i need to find the changed div"  - so you're doing ajax?
[18:05:33] <aljone> ok give me an example of data filtering
[18:05:44] <taplar> just filtering.  filter()
[18:05:49] <duch_kazatel> you use .filter() with a function
[18:06:29] <aljone> how filter is diffrent from find ?
[18:06:42] <duch_kazatel> with a function, it doesn;t use sizzle.
[18:07:44] <aljone> ok and what u mean by "with a function"
[18:07:46] <aljone> i have no ajax
[18:07:52] <taplar> $('.calender-content').filter(function(){ var $this = $(this);  return $this.data('time') === date && $this.data('date') === date; }).html(objectHTML);
[18:07:52] <duch_kazatel> .filter(function() {});
[18:08:06] <duch_kazatel> then it sounds like you need to use event handlers better.
[18:08:06] <taplar> err, i dorked the filter, but ex.
[18:08:33] <aljone> i still dont get how FILTER is better
[18:08:34] <aljone>  really
[18:08:44] <duch_kazatel> look up selector performance
[18:08:45] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[18:08:47] <duch_kazatel> sizzle is slow.
[18:08:50] <duch_kazatel> so avoid it where you can.
[18:09:14] <taplar> and attributes can be on anything, so sizzle or the dom doesn't have a good way to scope it down
[18:09:20] <duch_kazatel> ^;
[18:09:44] <aljone> hmm
[18:09:49] <aljone> ok so filter is the way i guess
[18:10:10] <duch_kazatel> i'm questioning if you really need that though.
[18:10:25] <duch_kazatel> can you show us a test case or something of what you're doing?
[18:10:53] <aljone> ill test the filter
[18:12:31] <aljone> its not really much faster
[18:12:43] <duch_kazatel> *sigh*
[18:12:43] <duch_kazatel> lol
[18:12:48] <duch_kazatel> i give up.
[18:12:54] <UserRT67> Hi all! I am trying to get the div under my li to stay put when i hover on the li any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/d974a4k0/
[18:13:13] <duch_kazatel> UserRT67 you can't do that.
[18:13:23] <duch_kazatel> <div> isn't a valid child of <ul>
[18:13:27] <aljone> duch_kazatel lol dont give up aha
[18:13:29] <duch_kazatel> so you're going to have tons of problems.
[18:13:34] <UserRT67> Oh shit yeah
[18:13:36] <UserRT67> I mean
[18:13:54] <taplar> aljone: given a small page, an attribute selector may not show a performance hit, but it is indeed doing more work
[18:14:00] <UserRT67> Ok lets say it was a ul
[18:14:07] <UserRT67> then what would i do?
[18:14:12] <taplar> and lots of small performance hits can add up to noticable performance hits
[18:14:16] <duch_kazatel> UserRT67 wut
[18:14:34] <duch_kazatel> UserRT67 update your fiddle.
[18:14:56] <taplar> which is why it's best practice to learn what are the ways to make jQuery do the least amount of work possible and make those your go to moves
[18:15:01] <duch_kazatel> UserRT67 because if you're replacing those divs with uls, that's going to cause the same problems.
[18:15:16] <UserRT67> I know... what suggest?
[18:15:25] <duch_kazatel> what are you building?
[18:15:33] <aljone> taplar: my dome is huge
[18:15:38] <aljone> DOM*
[18:15:42] <UserRT67> tying to build a mega menu
[18:15:52] <UserRT67> on rollovers
[18:15:54] <duch_kazatel> UserRT67 you generally would make those children of the current li
[18:15:55] <taplar> then all the more reason to do the things that make jQuery work the least
[18:16:17] <aljone> i know but the filter isnt helping really
[18:16:21] <duch_kazatel> ...
[18:16:27] <taplar> then don't listen to us
[18:16:29] <taplar> what do we know
[18:16:31] <UserRT67> err lets say it was span?
[18:16:39] <UserRT67> that legal?
[18:16:40] <duch_kazatel> aljone you don't get to tell us that you won't do something due to performance reasons and then deny a method that is faster.
[18:16:47] <duch_kazatel> UserRT67 literally nothing but an LI can go there.
[18:16:51] <duch_kazatel> lis only.
[18:17:00] <duch_kazatel> not divs, spans, uls, p, etc.
[18:17:11] <aljone> im not deny anythig im just telling u whats happening on my example, it didnt change much
[18:17:21] <duch_kazatel> aljone but it's still faster.
[18:17:29] <duch_kazatel> (shrug) good luck mang :)
[18:17:40] <aljone> :)
[18:17:44] <netcrash> Hello, When I do $(".value").text() on a webpage I get the content of 2 different spans that have that css, how can I filter to only get the first or second?
[18:18:03] <taplar> eq(#)
[18:18:26] <taplar> $(selector).eq(0).text()
[18:19:29] <taplar> aljone: here, take a look at this fiddle.  https://jsfiddle.net/9p52fvgr/1/  that is with the page being a tiny fiddle.  you can see the time difference in the console.
[18:21:12] <netcrash> taplar: thks
[18:23:30] <aljone> thanks
[18:24:21] <aljone> but u said filter with data attributes is good
[18:24:28] <taplar> yes
[18:24:41] <taplar> because filter does not use sizzle, which is the lookup engine that jquery uses
[18:25:08] <aljone> ok so using filter it doesnt matter
[18:25:12] <aljone> if its class or attribute
[18:25:15] <taplar> filter is pure and simple, iterate over the stack, return the elements that evaluate to be true
[18:25:47] <taplar> any attribute you should consider filter
[18:26:00] <taplar> unless you know the scope of your first selector is tiny
[18:26:08] <taplar> in which case, *shrug*, user preference
[18:26:21] <taplar> i still avoid them usually though
[18:34:05] <varun28356208935> Hi
[18:34:23] <taplar> kon'nichiwa
[18:38:33] * taplar starts singing butterflies
[18:39:14] <taplar> seems appropriate
[21:24:06] <ISmithers> Does anyone have/use a good front-end plugin that lets you crop and rotate images that can be deployed in an end product - ie something with an enterprise license. Something like this: http://slimimagecropper.com/ (which doesn't have a license for our use-case).
