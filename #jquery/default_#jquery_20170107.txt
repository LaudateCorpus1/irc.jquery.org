[00:24:01] <domino14> i have the strangest issue i've ever seen. check this out: $('#main-app-content').addClass   gives me an `undefined` in the console ??
[00:24:17] <domino14> $ is jquery. i do import $ from 'jquery' up top, and i'm using jquery 3.x from webpack
[00:25:22] <domino14> $('#main-app-content').click does not show up as undefined. just running $('#main-app-content') in the console does return a DOM object, but it appears to not be a jQuery object.
[01:04:20] <domino14> omfg why is $ a Chrome native selector
[01:04:24] <domino14> ARGHHH

[10:28:24] <calimba> hello everyone
[10:31:22] <calimba> how can i refresh a part of site every 5 minutes without refresh the entire site?
[11:26:08] <warlock> beginner queestion; what is the appropriate way to handle on click events for links. Is it to <a href="#" onclick="runsomefunction()"</a> or without the onclick event and handle it within jquery and hook the click?
[11:27:59] <systemfault> The appropriate way is to separate "JavaScript and jQuery" from the HTML
[11:28:14] <systemfault> So, to basically never use "onclick" attributes on tags.
[11:30:32] <warlock> understood, thanks systemfault
[12:08:13] <javascript781> how can i refresh a part of site every 5 minutes without refresh the entire site?
[12:08:28] <mrtAkdeniz> Howdy !
[12:08:54] <mrtAkdeniz> Guys I'm adding "active" class to all elements who has link to current page with that code -> $('[href="'+window.location.href+'"]').parent().addClass("active");
[12:09:33] <mrtAkdeniz> but I want to exclude 1 element from that, i mean if elements has "hover-red", i don't want to apply that rule to it
[12:11:33] <mrtAkdeniz> Ok, seems like i did with -> $('[href="'+window.location.href+'"]').parent().filter(function(index){ $('.hover-red').removeClass('active') })
[12:11:38] <mrtAkdeniz> Thanks anyway!
[14:16:01] <benlieb> how can I use jquery to post to a server like a form would? I don't need to send data, but I want it to post and follow the redirect the server sends
[14:16:39] <benlieb> maybe just post()
[14:16:53] <benlieb> oh, nope
[14:23:21] <benlieb> Is there a way to post to a server and follow a redirect like a form submit would do in javascript?
[14:37:09] <snover> benlieb: redirects are always followed for ajax requests, but they cannot follow redirects to another origin unless the new origin supports CORS
[14:38:11] <bjsnider> is there a way i can do this: https://jsfiddle.net/jka6u96u/
[14:38:24] <bjsnider> but prevent lines from being reset to 50 without a page reload?
[15:48:43] <javascript781> how can i refresh a part of site every 5 minutes without refresh the entire site?
[16:27:40] <`slikts> does jquery have something like .on() except it would fire after the event?
[16:28:01] <`slikts> i.e., when other handlers have finished
[16:28:44] <`slikts> guess I could just use setTimeout
[16:50:33] <dglambert> yo
[17:27:02] <javascript781> how can i refresh a part of site every 5 minutes without refresh the entire site?
[17:30:16] <hassoon> is it possible to get an element by its offset values ?
[17:30:19] <hassoon> the top and left
[17:57:56] <ussher_> The instructions on this page: https://captionjs.com/ seam to indicate that $('img.caption') will target an image with a data-caption="???" on it.  Its not targeting for me.  If i remove the .caption and just target img then it works.  Should img.caption target the image or does it need img.data-caption
[18:01:38] <ussher_> img[data-caption] works, will just use that.
[18:01:40] <ussher_> thanks.
[18:22:08] <pytuger> What is the usage for prop()? I don't understand fully yet, I've read w3schools, and tried some things out but it hasn't clicked yet
[18:54:27] <acidjazz> uhm
[18:54:35] <acidjazz> ussher_ i dont undertsand what captaionjs.com does
[20:47:13] <vacho> hello.. this code is not running since the class name is added after the DOM is done loading: http://pastie.org/10988559 any thoughts?
