[10:57:12] <grid-> hey
[10:57:13] <grid-> i'm having this function(s) https://jsfiddle.net/a7Lc302e/2/ but i need to set the word/string 'example' as being the inputparameter: tablename, so in this case it are line12: var table = $('#example').DataTable(); and line 19: const tableHeads = $("#example thead tr th"), can anone assist?
[11:03:04] <grid-> first line working
[11:03:12] <grid-> const tableHeads = $("+tablename+ thead tr th"); still this one isnt yet
[11:13:25] <shoky> grid-:  $("#" + tablename + " thead tr th")   or  $("#" + tablename).find("thead tr th")
[11:13:38] <shoky> or $(`#${tablename} thead tr th`)
[11:19:07] <grid-> shoky: that last one suits the best (in case of spaces)
[11:19:09] <grid-> thanks
[12:23:43] <grid-> hmm
[12:23:56] <grid-> anyone got a clue why this is not working? $("#example thead tr th .column_search").val('');
[13:03:26] <grid-> little question $('.column_search').val(''); will work (ofcourse), but i have this class adapted to more tables, so it only has to work on the path like: $('#example thead tr th .filterhead .column_search').val(''); but this isn't doing what it has to do, is there a bridge like > * or something so i can make it unique to #example? like for example $('#example > .column_search').val('');
[13:04:53] <grid-> $("#example ~ .column_search").val(''); isn't working
[13:05:01] <grid-> from google results
[13:23:23] <grid-> i've got the correct path, thanks anyways
[14:23:48] <ButtDog> Anyone have any idea how to select and change the pie progress on these? https://codepen.io/jo-asakura/pen/stFHi/
