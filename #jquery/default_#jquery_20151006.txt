[00:19:00] <bango> is there a way to call html() only on <br/>'s that are found in a given element, and not call html() on the element in its entirety?
[00:19:40] <bango> the <br/>'s are rendered as plaintext
[01:10:44] <bonks> Is there a way to $('#name').append('<script>...</script>'); and execute script after it's done appending?

[03:17:10] <jangoh> hi guys! is there online emu to check site for safari 9.0+ ?
[03:17:47] <Cork> jangoh: you can't use online emulators
[03:17:48] <jangoh> var is_safari = navigator.userAgent.indexOf("Safari") > -1;
[03:17:48] <jangoh>     if (is_safari) { }   this code target chrome also
[03:18:04] <jangoh> i want to target safari only
[03:18:05] <Cork> at least if you want to test if the site works
[03:18:13] <Cork> jangoh: ... why??
[03:18:21] <Cork> that's a horribly bad idea
[03:18:43] <Cork> it forces other browser producers to fake there identifications to get around the check
[03:18:54] <jangoh> tried many only online codes no luck :/
[03:19:11] <jangoh> only*
[03:19:13] <Cork> jangoh: don't do it, it is a really really bad idea
[03:19:26] <Cork> it is effectively breaking the web
[03:19:35] <jangoh> i guess need better regex
[03:19:38] <Cork> ...
[03:20:36] <Uhkis> is that check for "You seem to have a horrible browser, redirecting you to firefox download page" ? :-D
[03:20:44] <jangoh> if (chrome not in agent) && (safari in agent) {  }
[03:21:04] <jangoh> cork whats the best solution?
[03:21:29] <Cork> jangoh: make a site that "works" in all programs processing web pages
[03:21:41] <Cork> then enhance it with extra features for the specific browsers you want
[03:21:51] <Cork> never ever target only one browser
[03:22:01] <Cork> it is a disgustingly bad idea
[03:22:21] <jangoh> well i need to fix some css
[03:22:32] <jangoh> which is incorrect in safari
[03:22:36] <Cork> jangoh: don't do that with js...
[03:23:01] <Cork> well if you can sniff for the error you should
[03:23:06] <Cork> but not sniff the ua
[03:23:22] <jangoh> is there css query for safar 9.0+ ?
[03:23:24] <Cork> order you should try to fix it: 1. see if you can detect the error, not the browser
[03:23:39] <Cork> if that fails, 2. write a css hack to get around it
[03:23:47] <Cork> jangoh: no, cause you should not target a version
[03:24:13] <Cork> cause if the browser ever fixes the bug you will possibly make them not able to do so
[03:24:27] <Cork> cause fixing the bug "breaks too many websites"
[03:24:35] <jangoh> o_O
[03:24:44] <Cork> it happens all the time now days
[03:25:02] <Cork> chrome has hit it hard a few times in the last months
[03:25:08] <jangoh> Cork so tried some css hacks doesnt work
[03:25:22] <Cork> jangoh: what is the bug your trying to fix?
[03:25:49] <jangoh> overflow:hidden isnt working
[03:25:54] <Cork> on what?
[03:26:10] <jangoh> on a div has a pic inside
[03:26:20] <Cork> O_o
[03:26:24] <jangoh> for border-radius
[03:26:27] <Cork> ah
[03:26:29] <jangoh> to make round
[03:26:33] <Cork> that old bug
[03:26:58] <Cork> i'm quite sure it is fixed in newer versions of safari though
[03:27:08] <Cork> so 9.0+ sounds wrong
[03:27:35] <Cork> but ya you can't detect that with js
[03:28:33] <Cork> jangoh: also have you tried https://www.webkit.org/blog/181/css-masks/ ?
[03:28:52] <Cork> i think that one is a solution (haven't fiddled with it in ages though)
[03:29:26] <jangoh> may be its old browser
[03:32:12] <jangoh> i have chcked some emu its fine i guess they using old browser who reported
[03:53:33] <Y2Jozias> Hi guys, does anyone know if certain IP ranges get blacklisted eventually after retrieving external resources on web pages? (FE http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js)
[03:58:52] <Cork> Y2Jozias: not likely
[04:20:11] <curiousmansi> hi guys i what to know what is the right approach to code this few lines https://gist.github.com/mansisce/3bf6089d00ae844f84f9
[04:20:30] <curiousmansi> and what exactaly fadeout and fadein do in jquery?
[04:20:41] <Cork> ?api fadeOut
[04:20:42] <b-ot> we got dat
[04:20:46] <Cork> O_o
[04:20:47] <curiousmansi> yes
[04:20:54] <Cork> stupid bot...
[04:21:00] <curiousmansi> does that play with opacity ?
[04:21:11] <Cork> yes
[04:21:12] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/fadeout/
[04:21:57] <curiousmansi> what about https://gist.github.com/mansisce/3bf6089d00ae844f84f9 ?
[04:22:09] <Cork> what do you mean?
[04:22:44] <Cork> fade in followed by show and fadeout followed by hide won't work though
[04:23:01] <Cork> cause the show will make the element visible before the fadein animation starts
[04:23:05] <Cork> so the animation won't do anything
[04:28:54] <curiousmansi> i have 2 different divs. So what i want to do is div1.fadeOut and then hide like display:none.
[04:29:18] <curiousmansi> and then div2.fadeIn.show[display:block]
[04:29:25] <Cork> check the api docks
[04:29:40] <Cork> (the link i gave you)
[04:29:59] <Cork> your assuming fadeOut doesn't do something it does
[04:58:30] <zelol> http://laravel.io/bin/aNlky can someone helps me ?
[05:06:11] <Cork> zelol: not before you ask a question
[05:46:19] <midori-rus> Hello. Could anybody explain me how to check if some element ready at my page? It there is no this element nothing happened, in another case some function is run
[05:46:47] <Cork> midori-rus: element ready for what?
[05:46:48] <midori-rus> is div.notifier exists at the page I wanna set socket connection
[05:47:01] <midori-rus> if*
[05:47:17] <Cork> $('div.nofitier').length > 0) {}
[05:49:32] <midori-rus> Cork: is it good idea to set connection if div.notifier is exists? I have got some doubts
[05:50:01] <Cork> you're leaving out too much context, so i can't answer that
[05:51:54] <midori-rus> Cork: I want to make notifications at my page. The notifications will work using socket.io asynchronously. But I don't want to use it at all pages, only at few pages where I want it. How to setup connection where I want it?
[05:52:41] <Cork> midori-rus: checking for the existence of an element is an ok solution
[06:02:01] <midori-rus> Cork: thx, it works for me
[06:06:27] <Whiskey> Is it not possible to do like this, find(type > "td")
[06:07:16] <Xatenev> not a rly a jquery question but, Anybody knows if there is a tool like firebug/chrome dev tools for email clients?
[06:07:57] <Whiskey> lile find("table" > "td")
[06:23:23] <Whiskey> i can´t see why this not workling "var children = $(id > type).find("td").not(":last")"
[06:27:12] <Kartagis> Whiskey: testcase
[06:27:35] <Whiskey> I not sure how to build it up
[06:31:00] <Kartagis> jsfiddle.net
[06:31:24] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/7/ <-- thatts a test case i think that work
[06:31:27] <Whiskey> Yeh thanks i know how to do it
[06:33:44] <Kartagis> Whiskey: is this supposed to be all td'd but the last one?
[06:33:49] <Kartagis> td's
[06:34:06] <Whiskey> yeh
[06:34:27] <Whiskey> the code working, its just the way i select it i can´t do right
[06:36:44] <bongjovi> If I'm using this plugin: https://github.com/mreq/slick-lightbox/blob/master/src/scripts/slick-lightbox.js How would I call the open function?
[06:37:27] <Whiskey> actilly its no nee dtype maybe
[06:38:36] <Whiskey> Kartagis: if i remove type its working perfect :D
[06:38:48] <Whiskey> Don´t see why it don´t wanne find it
[06:39:39] <Whiskey> id = id find table "type" and then find the correct element in this case td
[06:50:14] <Whiskey> aaaa
[06:50:31] <Whiskey> Kartagis: var children = $(id + " " + type).find("td").not(":last")
[06:50:31] <Whiskey> that works
[06:53:20] <jangoh> my site loads twice: http://www.vitrina.co.il/
[07:01:16] <xenaxon> what's the best way of doing cartoon-like animations in canvas?
[07:28:21] <lenswipee> Hi, I would like to replace an entire <p> with another <p>. What is the correct syntax?
[07:29:04] <lenswipee> I tried $('p').replace('<p>test</p>');
[07:29:23] <shoky> .replaceWith
[07:29:45] <shoky> though usually it's best to just set its context e.g. with .text(...)
[07:29:53] <shoky> content, not context
[07:31:41] <lenswipee> thanks
[08:31:20] <Paradisee> what's the best way to make this code in jquery: http://dpaste.com/15G1B92
[08:33:03] <d3m0n> Paradisee, what does make it in jquery mean exactly? Sure, you can change AngularJS into AJAX if you wanted.
[08:33:18] <Paradisee> i dont use angular.
[08:33:25] <Xatenev> Paradisee: what is that ur using
[08:33:29] <Xatenev> i cant identify that lol
[08:33:37] <Paradisee> it is django
[08:33:57] <Xatenev> and what is javascript here?
[08:33:57] <Xatenev> it mostly looks like a template with variables?
[08:34:09] <Paradisee> ya but dont look at there variables.
[08:34:16] <Paradisee> they will be replaced with jquery
[08:34:22] <d3m0n> My point being, sure you can take one framework and make it work in jquery (ajax)
[08:34:22] <Xatenev> so what do u wnana do
[08:34:41] <d3m0n> It'll need to be backed by server side language.
[08:34:42] <Paradisee> i need to dinamically make that markup usng jquery
[08:35:00] <Paradisee> it is inside an .each()
[08:35:07] <Xatenev> i dont see an .each() in your paste
[08:35:10] <Xatenev> and i dont understand what u want sry
[08:35:14] <compact> http://pastebin.com/dqkCpebv <-- any idea why its closing <tbody> before it loops?
[08:35:17] <Paradisee> i didnt paste any jquery code.
[08:35:23] <taplar> Paradisee: does the structure change at all?
[08:35:24] <d3m0n> Unless you have a json present Paradisee
[08:35:25] <taplar> or just the data
[08:35:32] <Paradisee> taplar: just data
[08:35:41] <Paradisee> d3m0n: got a json ya.
[08:35:51] <taplar> then i would recommend making that a fragment, and get the html via ajax, and put the data in it
[08:35:57] <taplar> don't generate the entire html with js
[08:36:02] <Xatenev> compact: yes
[08:36:07] <Xatenev> compact: async and sync problem :p
[08:36:09] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/1SF5AWH
[08:36:10] <Paradisee> ^
[08:36:24] <compact> Xatenev, any suggestions how to fix
[08:36:24] <Xatenev> compact: your looping inside an async function
[08:36:39] <taplar> you wouldn't do an each with the data
[08:36:40] <Xatenev> write the .append($footer); behind the loop
[08:36:49] <d3m0n> Yeah so Paradisee, that shouldn't be hard.
[08:36:51] <taplar> since it's a single html document, and it's not json
[08:37:00] <Paradisee> so? what do you suggest?
[08:37:10] <Paradisee> data is json.
[08:37:28] <taplar> $.get('locationoffragmenthtml', function(data){ /* set the data and insert to page */ });
[08:37:49] <compact> how do you do that (new to jquery(
[08:37:52] <d3m0n> Paradisee: You append the vars to the html
[08:38:03] <d3m0n> Same way you're doing now
[08:38:06] <d3m0n> But different syntax
[08:38:13] <d3m0n> throw it in a var
[08:38:14] <Paradisee> any example?
[08:38:25] <taplar> holdon...
[08:38:38] <Xatenev> compact: ?
[08:38:38] <d3m0n> Paradisee: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/327231/best-way-to-display-data-via-json-using-jquery
[08:38:45] <Xatenev> compact: copy the two lines behind the for loop
[08:39:09] <d3m0n> Paradisee: You could straight append if you needed
[08:39:17] <Paradisee> d3m0n: so ugly
[08:39:21] <d3m0n> Ha!
[08:39:29] <d3m0n> AngularJs then!
[08:39:32] <compact> Xatenev, won't that write it before the loop though
[08:39:41] <taplar> ah, crud, my example is heavily wrapped, :(
[08:39:43] <Xatenev> compact: no
[08:39:46] <Xatenev> compact: why?
[08:40:01] <Xatenev> compact: the loop runs through, if the loop is finished your appending the result, and then the footer?
[08:40:02] <Paradisee> lets give a try.
[08:41:13] <taplar> only thing i'd say about that SO link, it's appending inside a loop.  better to put to an array or fragment and append last outside the loop
[08:46:55] <Xatenev> compact: did it work?
[08:47:19] <compact> yeah got it
[08:47:21] <compact> thakns heaps
[08:54:24] <Footer> Hi
[08:54:34] <Footer> Hi
[08:54:53] <Footer> I am getting cross site scripting error
[08:55:11] <Footer> I used jsonp to solve it
[08:55:31] <Footer> It sent back the error unexpected :
[08:55:54] <Footer> When I click that error I get the main data I want and error in it
[08:58:00] <Footer> Anybody?
[08:59:14] <zelol> can someone helps me ? my issue here : http://laravel.io/bin/aNlky .
[09:02:28] <taplar> zelol: you'll need to split the value on ',' and push each piece
[09:03:06] <zelol> taplar i dont find explode() for arrays
[09:03:19] <taplar> split(',')
[09:03:29] <taplar> and it's for strings
[09:03:42] <zelol> ok
[09:03:43] <zelol> ty
[09:50:03] <Whiskey> <div id="fileinfoblock0" class="dataViewBox-BottomBorder"> | <div id="fileinfo0" class="dataViewBox-Data"> | <table class="FileInfo"> can i by select the class FileInfo somehow find out the first id ?
[09:52:21] <Duikb00t> Someone here an idea how to setup a webcam stream?
[09:55:12] <BillCriswell> Whiskey: Is it always two parents up?
[09:55:28] <Whiskey> $(".FileInfo").closest("div").attr("id") <-- give me fileinfo0" but i can´t find out how to get fileinfoblock0
[09:55:55] <Whiskey> Yes its always two parents up BillCriswell
[09:56:02] <BillCriswell> If you always have to go two parents up you can do $('.FileInfo').parent().parent().prop('id');
[09:56:13] <Whiskey> that was easy :D
[09:56:53] <Whiskey> works perfect thanks
[09:57:51] <BillCriswell> No problem
[10:07:11] <Whiskey> BillCriswell: looks like it not worked as i wase hope
[10:07:20] <Whiskey> was hope, i try to use it this way. "$(".FileInfo").parent().parent().prop("id").hide()"
[10:07:45] <BillCriswell> You wouldn't need the prop('id') in that case. Just parent().parent().hide()
[10:09:12] <Whiskey> yeh works perfect :)
[10:10:59] <Whiskey> BillCriswell: most be some more good way to do this
[10:14:41] <BillCriswell> I don't know enough about what you're trying to do.
[10:23:03] <Whiskey> well it has to work for now batter then before anyways :)
[10:23:50] <dimi1947> Is there a way I can target a div solely by its data attribute?
[10:24:19] <dimi1947> if for example a div has data-id="2"...target is with this
[10:25:26] <ceramicskull> Is there a way to return only specific data from a page using $.get? Or does it return pretty much everything?
[10:46:09] <BillCriswell> ceramicskull: Are you talking about html or json?
[10:46:30] <ceramicskull> HTML, I tried using load but I return a bunch of errors in the console
[10:46:49] <BillCriswell> ceramicskull: What kind of errors? Are you loading html from the same domain?
[10:46:55] <ceramicskull> yea
[10:47:29] <ceramicskull> It just says some images weren't HTTPS, some .js files aren't being called, etc.
[10:47:39] <ceramicskull> but that's weird because I'm not even trying to load that :\
[10:48:14] <BillCriswell> I think it would try to get the whole page then use the selector you pass to filter the elements down.
[10:48:19] <ceramicskull> Using $.get has provided way better results, however, that's just pulling all the HTML rather.
[10:50:02] <BillCriswell> ceramicskull: You can wrapping the resulting html in $(), but I think that would throw an error as well since http and https are considered two different domains as far as I understand it.
[10:50:18] <BillCriswell> You might be able to strip the https stuff then parse it with $().
[10:51:10] <ceramicskull> yea, with $.get I don't receive any errors - but due to some security scripts for injections, I think it's stopping me in my tracks from moving on as well :\
[10:53:29] <BillCriswell> ceramicskull: How good is the html? Might be able to write a simple regular expression to remove the tags you don't need.
[10:54:32] <ceramicskull> Ehhh, imo it's pretty bad lol
[10:54:49] <ceramicskull> I didn't write it though
[10:55:14] <BillCriswell> Is it consistently bad?
[10:55:28] <BillCriswell> or inconsistently bad, the worse type of bad.
[10:55:32] <BillCriswell> worst*
[10:56:03] <Kamuela> I wonder if I’m paying for not using jQuery right now
[10:56:30] <Kamuela> I have a feeling there are still cross browser inconsistencies that no one likes to talk about
[10:56:40] <BillCriswell> Kamuela: Absolutely.
[10:57:12] <BillCriswell> @Kamuela https://twitter.com/paul_irish/status/431584056883429376
[10:57:13] <b-ot> (BillCriswell) @paul_irish (Paul Irish): You Might Not Need jQuery! … assuming you'll address these bugs in your hand-written code: https://t.co/j2hrG2nCpX (1 year and 8 months ago)
[10:57:14] <Kamuela> I’m paying for lack of testing, jQuery, a feeble understanding of Flux, lol
[10:57:24] <Kamuela> brb, still digging
[10:57:29] <ceramicskull> It's the worst type of bad
[10:57:53] <ceramicskull> like, too many repetitive classes that make it hard to really try to use specific selectors :\
[10:57:55] <Kamuela> the best part is you can go right back to 1.x if you need to
[10:58:08] <ceramicskull> No ID's, etc...
[10:58:12] * Kamuela three cheers for jQuery
[10:58:39] <Kamuela> I wholeheartedly feel like there’s a community of academic purists, and a community of people who get shit done
[10:58:48] <Kamuela> One of them doesn’t speak ill of jQuery
[10:59:02] <BillCriswell> ceramicskull: The thing is I don't think you'd be able to use normal selectors to filter out what you don't need since parsing it is where the issue comes from.
[10:59:25] <BillCriswell> Which is why I think sadly you'd need to use a regular expression on the string.
[11:00:27] <hassoon> how to wait for an element to appear, so once that's the case, i apply call some funciton
[11:00:30] <hassoon> *funciton
[11:01:03] <hassoon> let's say a div with a class .input-group.date
[11:01:09] <BillCriswell> hassoon: How are you getting the element to appear?
[11:02:42] <Kamuela> BillCriswell: that doc is awesome thank you
[11:02:51] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[11:06:08] <hassoon> BillCriswell: in click on a button, the button shows up a bootsrap modal div, then the modal loads a html/php file that contains a div with the said class .input-group.date
[11:06:12] <hassoon> I click *
[11:06:52] <BillCriswell> How are you loading it, with like $('.foo').load('modal.php'); then you want to do things to elements in modal.php?
[11:09:56] <ray_lam_> Hello
[11:10:02] <ray_lam_> I had a question about a commit into core jQuery
[11:10:04] <BillCriswell> hassoon: Either way, it sounds like you'd want to use event delegation.
[11:10:11] <ray_lam_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/faf295a6d85ea716bd795609efdd855938144512
[11:10:16] <ray_lam_> I noticed that this was committed to the compat branch and not the master
[11:10:20] <ray_lam_> and thus it didn't make it into the jquery 1.11.3 release
[11:10:25] <ray_lam_> are there any plans to incorporate this commit before jquery 3.0?
[11:21:54] <bango2> so I've got an element im running .text() on, but I want to, after that, grab all the text <br />'s i see and convert them to .html(). any way to do that with jquery?
[11:23:12] <bango2> basically im making the standard node chat app and want to apply newlines, but i dont want them to be able to arbitrarily insert html
[11:26:29] <BillCriswell> bango2: You can use .html() instead of .text().
[11:26:51] <bango2> BillCriswell, yes i was doing that, but that allows the user to insert, for instance, <a href> tags
[11:26:56] <bango2> just any html they can insert
[11:27:36] <bango2> I'm finding and replacing newlines \n with br tags, but obv theyre showing up as plaintext and i want only those br to be html-ified
[11:31:28] <Kamuela> Is jQuery on npm up to date?
[11:31:37] <PurePandemonium> splice the text and wrap each section in p or div tags?
[11:33:05] <bango2> I could do that, im exploring another option right now wrapping in a pre tag and leaving the newline character \n
[11:34:46] <bango2> which seems to work
[11:36:32] <PurePandemonium> wrapping each section in any block level tag will make a space between them similar to a <br>
[11:37:16] <bango2> +1, but the pre tag is doing what I want without any script. just inserting the message into a pre and it preserves newlines and spaces
[11:37:31] <PurePandemonium> gotcha
[11:37:46] <bango2> thanks for your suggestions guys
[11:46:39] <Kamuela> I’ve just added this all over my code // TODO: Update to jQuery

[12:05:58] <notchris> Hello All!
[12:06:07] <notchris> Good afternoon / whatnot
[12:06:45] <grimgrinn> hey bro
[12:08:05] <duch_kazatel> grimgrinn i'd need to actually see the broken code.
[12:08:53] <grimgrinn> 	
[12:08:54] <grimgrinn> 	<script>
[12:08:54] <grimgrinn> 	$(document).ready(function() {
[12:08:54] <grimgrinn> 		$(".popup").magnificPopup();
[12:08:54] <grimgrinn> 		
[12:08:54] <grimgrinn> 		$("#form").submit(function(e){
[12:08:54] <grimgrinn> 		e.preventDefault;
[12:08:55] <grimgrinn> 		$.ajax({
[12:08:55] <grimgrinn> 			type:"POST",
[12:08:56] <grimgrinn> 			url:"mail.php",
[12:08:56] <grimgrinn> 			data: $(this).serialize()
[12:08:56] <duch_kazatel> wiag
[12:08:57] <grimgrinn> 			}).done(function(){
[12:08:57] <grimgrinn> alert("Hello! I am an alert box!!");
[12:09:10] <duch_kazatel> done?
[12:09:41] <duch_kazatel> grimgrinn don't paste in the channel - use something like jsfiddle instead.
[12:09:53] <grimgrinn> sorry
[12:10:03] <grimgrinn> kindly first time here
[12:10:18] <duch_kazatel> yesterday was your first time i thought ;)
[12:12:34] <grimgrinn> heey) saaaw me yesterday) yeah. its pretty awkward)
[12:12:36] <grimgrinn> https://jsfiddle.net/p3w2fruq/
[12:13:11] <duch_kazatel> don't randomly put return false in things btw.
[12:13:51] <duch_kazatel> and that code should theoretically work, though alerts are something to be universally avoided so i wouldn't worry too much.
[12:13:58] <shoky`> only if you fail to event.preventDefault() properly :P
[12:14:22] <duch_kazatel> shoky` returning false out of document ready?
[12:14:23] <duch_kazatel> ;;)
[12:14:54] <shoky`> ah bad indentation. well there's his problem then
[12:15:24] <grimgrinn> what what/ what my problem?
[12:15:27] <shoky`> (line 7)
[12:16:02] <grimgrinn> prevent default?
[12:16:03] <duch_kazatel> grimgrinn we're talking about bad code and formatting - your alert should work.
[12:16:19] <shoky`> i'm talking about  event.preventDefault;
[12:16:33] <shoky`> well, e.preventDefault;
[12:16:35] <grimgrinn> is ti bad?
[12:16:41] <shoky`> it'
[12:16:42] <grimgrinn> it*
[12:16:42] <duch_kazatel> it's wrong.
[12:16:50] <shoky`> preventDefault is a method/function
[12:16:52] <duch_kazatel> but it won't cause the problem you're having, grimgrinn
[12:16:54] <grimgrinn> well why?
[12:17:01] <duch_kazatel> you're missing the ()
[12:17:11] <shoky`> what problem is he having?
[12:17:17] <duch_kazatel> the alert doesn't fire.
[12:17:21] <duch_kazatel> but the console.log() does.
[12:17:46] <shoky`> could be some weird behaviour due to the form submitting, no?
[12:18:04] <duch_kazatel> grimgrinn does the page still reload?
[12:18:22] <grimgrinn> its reload
[12:18:27] <duch_kazatel> that's why the alert doesn't fire.
[12:18:30] <duch_kazatel> shoky was right.
[12:18:34] <grimgrinn> and console log works
[12:18:37] <duch_kazatel> change that to e.preventDefault();
[12:18:48] <grimgrinn> minewhyle alers\ts doents
[12:19:01] <duch_kazatel> right, because the page is reloading.
[12:19:10] <grimgrinn> yeah. did it just now.. everything still same
[12:19:22] <duch_kazatel> show us.
[12:19:25] <duch_kazatel> in the fiddle.
[12:21:03] <grimgrinn> https://jsfiddle.net/p3w2fruq/1/
[12:21:26] <duch_kazatel> ditch the return false out of that document ready btw.
[12:22:36] <grimgrinn> sorry, what ditch is?
[12:22:40] <duch_kazatel> remove it.
[12:28:49] <grimgrinn> removed, hothn change
[12:29:00] <duch_kazatel> that was an aside.
[12:29:01] <bango2> grimgrinn your problem is that no alerts?
[12:29:13] <duch_kazatel> he gets the console log though
[12:29:28] <bango2> you probably checked prevent this page from displaying further messages
[12:29:43] <bango2> try to clear your browser cache
[12:31:46] <Sal> is there a more "elegant" way on doing this: var offset = ($el.data('offset') !== undefined) ? $el.data('offset') : '0,0';
[12:32:23] <duch_kazatel> var offset = $el.data('offset') || '0,0';
[12:32:42] <Sal> damn, u always got it
[12:33:23] <bango2> but el can still be falsy without being undefined
[12:33:29] <Sal> do you think that passing x,y in a string is the best solution?
[12:33:40] <duch_kazatel> uh
[12:33:41] <Sal> or can i use a json string for it?
[12:33:44] <duch_kazatel> bango2 wat
[12:33:50] <duch_kazatel> Sal is $el a jquery object?
[12:34:20] <Sal> its $('.myclass')
[12:34:25] <bango2> yes then
[12:34:29] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[12:34:39] <duch_kazatel> so bango2 $el can't be falsy ;)
[12:34:57] <bango2> alright. well my work here is done. lol
[12:35:31] <duch_kazatel> Sal using json depends on a whole lot of factors.
[12:35:41] <duch_kazatel> i'd just use the x,y for now.
[12:36:00] <duch_kazatel> because storing complex objects on strings is a kind of sketchy proposition
[12:36:24] <taplar> data-offset-x="0" data-offset-y="0"
[12:36:29] <duch_kazatel> or do that.
[12:36:34] <duch_kazatel> which is probably your "safest" bet.
[12:36:46] <Sal> ok, taplar yes, i wanted to do that too, but it seems too long
[12:37:00] <duch_kazatel> it's clear.
[12:37:03] <taplar> better to be verbose
[12:37:08] <duch_kazatel> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[12:37:10] <duch_kazatel> all day every day.
[12:37:11] <Sal> yes, but i have to check for both
[12:37:19] <duch_kazatel> so?
[12:37:20] <duch_kazatel> it's explicit.
[12:37:22] <Sal> and iof one doesn't exist, it should get the value of the other
[12:37:22] <duch_kazatel> that's a good thing.
[12:37:34] <Sal> i just wanted something faster
[12:37:41] <duch_kazatel> never faster
[12:37:44] <duch_kazatel> always more explicit.
[12:37:47] <duch_kazatel> clearer code is better code.
[12:38:00] <Sal> what if i write data-offset="{x:0,y:0}" ?
[12:38:13] <Sal> will that convert into obj when i read data?
[12:38:17] <duch_kazatel> no.
[12:38:19] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[12:38:25] <duch_kazatel> use the two attributes.
[12:38:32] <duch_kazatel> because otherwise you're getting into janky territory.
[12:39:16] <Sal> ok
[12:39:21] <Sal> i'll use 2 attr
[12:39:25] <Sal> thanks again
[12:40:21] <Sal> var offset = {x: $el.data('offset-x') || 0, y: $el.data('offset-y') || 0};
[12:40:24] <Sal> correct?
[12:40:37] <duch_kazatel> uh
[12:40:39] <duch_kazatel> wut
[12:41:01] <taplar> why do you need the object?  your $el is already an object
[12:41:06] <duch_kazatel> so a couple things - 1: fix the thing that outputs coords.
[12:41:22] <duch_kazatel> and make sure they always output.
[12:41:48] <duch_kazatel> 2: what's with the intermediary object in the first place?
[12:41:52] <Sal> taplar: because i think that passing a small obj is better than passing a big obj
[12:42:03] <duch_kazatel> Sal "passing" in what way?
[12:42:03] <taplar> big object is already in memory
[12:42:07] <duch_kazatel> where is this data headed?
[12:42:21] <duch_kazatel> also, $el.data('offset-x') is going to return a "small obj"
[12:42:23] <ceramicskull> Hi all
[12:42:25] <ceramicskull> :)
[12:42:28] <Sal> to a function that checks if x+width and y+height stay inside view
[12:42:33] <taplar> hey skull on painkillers
[12:42:43] <duch_kazatel> Sal just pass those two values as args.
[12:42:50] <duch_kazatel> instead of constructing an object.
[12:42:53] <ceramicskull> Lmao taplar :P
[12:43:06] <Sal> ok
[12:43:43] <ceramicskull> Is that try.jquery.com new?
[12:43:59] <duch_kazatel> it's been around for a while.
[12:44:29] <ceramicskull> Hmmm, never seen it. I've pretty much learned jquery just by doing it lol
[12:44:50] <duch_kazatel> a little experience and the api docs work for lots of devs.
[12:44:50] <ceramicskull> Well, I'm still learning but definitely going to try it out
[12:44:57] <duch_kazatel> people new to programming need that extra kick, though.
[12:56:12] <grimgrinn> guys
[12:56:33] <grimgrinn> what about my thing?
[12:56:46] <duch_kazatel> grimgrinn dunno.
[13:15:44] <grimgrinn> damn
[13:26:32] <tx2> Hi guys, I have a bunch of divs that store questions (each div is a "question"), and inside that div can be one or more input fields (created by jquery if the user wants more than one response).
[13:26:55] <tx2> How can I count the number of answered questions? aka, number of non-empty input fields per question, rather than just the total number of non-empty responses.
[13:28:04] <tx2> I know I can use $('input[value!=""]').length to count the number of non-empty responses (all inputs), but I want to count the # questions that have at least one non-empty input
[13:32:56] <taplar> tx2: find the divs, filter on those that have one non empty input
[13:32:59] <bango2> tx2 something like this https://bpaste.net/show/219509da992b
[13:35:10] <Komanda> i know you can do a jquery json  30X request and it follows the redirection, but what about same origin policy? if i redirect comes from a different domain but  the json is hosted on the same domain? would this cause any trouble?
[13:35:37] <taplar> tx2: this is along the lines of what i was suggesting http://jsfiddle.net/n66Lfv2a/
[13:35:52] <tx2> thanks guys, I'll give 'er a look.
[14:08:29] <nemmonszzz> hello all. i have a div with style="display:none" and then i'm trying to call jquery's show() function on it in an ajax callback function but it doesn't work. i placed debug lines of code above and below it so i can guarantee that the line is being executed.  if i then go into chrome developer console and type $("#myId").show(), the div appears immediately
[14:08:39] <nemmonszzz> does anyone have any thoughts on what might be going on here?
[14:10:53] <taplar> nemmonszzz: you could try console logging the selector.length to make sure it is selecting the element
[14:15:35] <nemmonszzz> taplar: thanks for the suggestion. logging the length works fine so i'm definitely selecting the element.
[14:15:55] <nemmonszzz> i can literally copy the line of code out of the javascript and paste it into my console where it runs fine
[14:16:28] <taplar> so your length is greater than 0?
[14:16:33] <nemmonszzz> yes
[14:18:52] <taplar> you said your doing it in an ajax callback.  other than showing the element, what other operations are you doing to it?
[14:19:10] <taplar> can you show your code in a fiddle?
[14:20:26] <nemmonszzz> i'm getting some data back from the ajax request and passing it to the element doing $("#myID").html(data["message"]). And that works just fine
[14:53:54] <lineinthesand> Which html tag do I have to style in order to change the color of the header of a collapsible set?
[14:54:54] <taplar> depends on the implementation.  right click and inspect on the element you want to change
[15:00:15] <lineinthesand> taplar, OK, thanks. I hope I can figure it out. It seems that jqm inserts an anchor tag inside of the h2.
[15:04:39] <lineinthesand> Got it!
[15:04:47] <taplar> awesome
[15:29:42] <Zeranoe> How could I restrict input to numeric only on an <input> for older browsers that don't support type="number"
[15:36:18] <AdamPDotty> Zeranoe: On submit you check for data type and cancel submission in case it fails.
[15:37:15] <nodist> ^[0-9]*$ regex
[15:37:18] <Zeranoe> AdamPDotty: I would like to restrict invalid input as the user is typing, if possible
[15:37:31] <AdamPDotty> ok, then check on change
[15:38:02] <taplar> it's safer on submit, as 'on typing' depends on the user typing.  pasting isn't really typing
[15:38:06] <Zeranoe> AdamPDotty: on what change?
[15:38:41] <taplar> but in any case you'll still need validation on the backside anyway
[15:39:31] <Zeranoe> taplar: of course, this is for easy of use
[15:39:49] <Zeranoe> ease*
[15:41:25] <AdamPDotty> $('input.hasToBeNumber').on('change', function(){if isNaN(this.value) this.value='';});
[15:42:12] <Zeranoe> AdamPDotty: What is the browser support for the change event?
[15:43:04] <grimgrinn> guys
[15:43:13] <grimgrinn> https://jsfiddle.net/wfpvn9tc/
[15:43:23] <grimgrinn> why its doesnt get the mail.php
[15:43:28] <grimgrinn> i just dont get it
[15:43:37] <grimgrinn> everything seems to be right
[15:44:44] <taplar> or something like this http://jsfiddle.net/mk5mdm3L/
[15:45:36] <taplar> Zeranoe: ^
[15:46:45] <taplar> heh, small bug, can't blank it out
[15:47:57] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/mk5mdm3L/1/
[16:03:47] <tx2> any way to get a find() on a selector to find dynamically created ones?
[16:04:13] <taplar> you can execute a find on any jquery object
[16:04:15] <tx2> er, ones = whatever you're selecting
[16:04:20] <charles382> hello
[16:04:34] <tx2> taplar, even ones you have appended on to?
[16:04:40] <taplar> yes
[16:04:44] <tx2> (was not originally part of the DOM)
[16:04:49] <taplar> yep
[16:04:51] <tx2> weird, my find is not returning the new ones
[16:04:58] <taplar> an element does not have to be in the dom to do a find on it
[16:05:13] <taplar> for instance, you can find on fragments before you append them to the dom
[16:05:16] <charles382> could someone possibly help me out with a bit of javascript? i'm trying to get something to work
[16:05:41] <taplar> charles382: sure, just ask the question/share the fiddle.  if people can help they'll chime in
[16:05:59] <charles382> okay, thanks, there is no fiddle because i hope its simple enough
[16:06:42] <charles382> so i have a div that fades in on scroll position of greater than 150, and fade in on lesser position of 150.
[16:06:58] <charles382> i also want it to fade out at greater than 800
[16:07:19] <charles382> but i don't know how to write the script that tells it to ignore the first rule, because the div starts flashing
[16:07:30] <charles382> $(window).scroll(function() {                if($(document).scrollTop() > 150)         $('.footer').fadeIn();     if($(document).scrollTop() > 800)        $('.footer').fadeOut();          });
[16:07:34] <duch_kazatel> eep
[16:07:38] <duch_kazatel> don't paste code in the channel :)
[16:07:43] <duch_kazatel> barely readable - make a fiddle instead.
[16:07:48] <charles382> okay, gimme a min
[16:08:22] <taplar> though, from your question, it's implementing an if conditional with an or clause
[16:08:46] <taplar> if (scroll < 150 || scroll > 800) fadeIn
[16:08:51] <duch_kazatel> there's a lot of cleanup to do here.
[16:09:09] <taplar> else fadeOut
[16:09:10] <duch_kazatel> $(document).scrollTop() is no bueno in a scroll even listener.
[16:09:19] <duch_kazatel> but yeah, the basic gist is there.
[16:09:20] <grimgrinn> hey
[16:09:27] <grimgrinn> anyone?
[16:09:44] <duch_kazatel> grimgrinn did you have a question?
[16:09:55] <grimgrinn> yes i am
[16:10:05] <grimgrinn> https://jsfiddle.net/wfpvn9tc/
[16:10:14] <grimgrinn> mail.php doesnt work
[16:10:19] <grimgrinn> and alert too
[16:10:30] <grimgrinn> but consolelog is work
[16:10:30] <duch_kazatel> grimgrinn bummer.
[16:10:50] <duch_kazatel> we explained this earlier to you.
[16:11:01] <duch_kazatel> since the page is reloading, it's not going to work.
[16:11:08] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wfpvn9tc/3/
[16:13:11] <duch_kazatel> grimgrinn how's that?
[16:14:39] <grimgrinn> same (
[16:14:46] <duch_kazatel> is the page still reloading?
[16:15:14] <grimgrinn> its not reloadinf
[16:15:17] <grimgrinn> g
[16:15:29] <duch_kazatel> and you've verified that you're allowing popups on that page?
[16:15:36] <grimgrinn> popup just disappear
[16:15:41] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:15:52] <grimgrinn> what you mean
[16:16:03] <grimgrinn> i see a poppup
[16:16:11] <duch_kazatel> so you see the alert box now?
[16:16:19] <grimgrinn> but when its send - hothig happines
[16:16:24] <grimgrinn> no
[16:16:45] <grimgrinn> and letter doent comes
[16:16:51] <grimgrinn> doesnt*
[16:17:06] <duch_kazatel> okay. some browsers have a checkbox after repeated alerts to hide further alerts.  i suspect that's happening here.
[16:17:24] <duch_kazatel> as far as your mail.php issue - check your network tab in your browser and make sure the ajax call is happening correctly.
[16:17:34] <duch_kazatel> if it is, check the server and see if that part is working correctly.
[16:18:10] <charles382> --okay, i've got a jfiddle of my code working, i just need to know how to alter the code so it fades out after a certain point (lets say past the height of the image) https://jsfiddle.net/r793guo0/
[16:18:26] <duch_kazatel> charles382 taplar explained how earlier.
[16:18:58] <grimgrinn> i tried to check if mail.php even calling by put some js code there
[16:19:06] <grimgrinn> with console log directive
[16:19:09] <grimgrinn> its not
[16:19:17] <duch_kazatel> grimgrinn so the php side isn't working either?
[16:19:22] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you need to fix that part first then.
[16:19:24] <grimgrinn> yeah
[16:19:31] <grimgrinn> agree
[16:19:42] <grimgrinn> but how? )
[16:19:51] <duch_kazatel> find a channel about PHP and ask there.
[16:20:22] <grimgrinn> oh
[16:20:24] <duch_kazatel> charles382 so what were the conditions again?
[16:20:51] <charles382> if its greater than 800 scroll position it should fade back out
[16:21:58] <duch_kazatel> what were the other conditions?
[16:21:59] <charles382> if its less than 150 it should fade in
[16:22:02] <charles382> i mean fade out
[16:22:05] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:22:11] <charles382> so less than 150, 0 opacity, more than 800, 0 opacity
[16:22:16] <charles382> inbetween, 100
[16:22:19] <duch_kazatel> woah.
[16:22:19] <charles382> opacity
[16:22:23] <duch_kazatel> you're making this confusing.
[16:22:26] <duch_kazatel> one sentence :)
[16:22:44] <charles382> Okay, so I have this but its not working
[16:22:49] <charles382> if($(document).scrollTop() > 150 || < 800)
[16:23:07] <duch_kazatel> that's not how or clauses work :)
[16:23:29] <grimgrinn> tried it in another browser and alert box is appears! but mail still doent (
[16:23:32] <charles382> i know very little javascript, im absolutely trying to wing it here
[16:23:35] <duch_kazatel> charles382 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/r793guo0/1/
[16:24:12] <duch_kazatel> charles382 if ($document.scrollTop() > 150 || $document.scrollTop() < 800) { - you have to fully reevaluate.
[16:24:21] <duch_kazatel> grimgrinn bummer.  have you asked in a php channel yet?
[16:25:04] <charles382> im not sure what reevaluate means
[16:25:11] <charles382> sorry for being slow
[16:26:00] <duch_kazatel> charles382 as in, you can't do || < 800
[16:26:05] <grimgrinn> please say, how to get echo from php to the console or some div via ajaxx?
[16:26:31] <duch_kazatel> grimgrinn you can't.  you have to return the data to the ajax call and then print that out in your .done()
[16:26:34] <charles382> cant i just say, be visible inbetween these two scroll positions
[16:26:37] <charles382> else, dont be visible
[16:26:44] <duch_kazatel> charles382 that's basically what you're saying.
[16:26:54] <duch_kazatel> you have to say "if this condition OR this condition"
[16:26:58] <duch_kazatel> you have to be explicit.
[16:27:24] <charles382> so i have to define, less than 150 and more than 800, as well as more than 150 and less than 800?
[16:27:32] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[16:27:42] <duch_kazatel> the else handles every other case.
[16:27:55] <charles382> okay, btw this is me learning javascript for the first time
[16:28:02] <charles382> so i appreciate your patience
[16:28:14] <duch_kazatel> actually you want https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/r793guo0/2/
[16:28:15] <duch_kazatel> not or
[16:28:20] <duch_kazatel> you need an AND.
[16:28:25] <duch_kazatel> my bad.
[16:28:39] <charles382> ah you legend, thats the ticket
[16:28:59] <charles382> thank you very much
[16:29:15] <charles382> was the '&&' the issue? i was using ||
[16:29:50] <duch_kazatel> yeah, that's why i was prodding you for the english sented ;)
[16:30:07] <duch_kazatel> "if greater than 150 and less than 800, do this this.  otherwise, do this other thing."
[16:31:23] <charles382> I'm a little stoned so my initial way of explaining was probably retarded
[16:31:31] <duch_kazatel> hey that words not okay.
[16:31:32] <duch_kazatel> thanks!
[16:31:46] <charles382> but yeh, i get that asking a simple question that is logical helps you understand how to code it
[16:31:48] <charles382> and my apologies
[16:32:08] <charles382> which word might i ask?
[16:32:16] <charles382> just so i don't accidentally repeat myself
[16:32:23] <duch_kazatel> "retarded"
[16:33:03] <charles382> you know thats the original title of the black eyed peas song: 'let's get it started in here'
[16:33:12] <charles382> but replacing 'it started'
[16:38:50] <Zeranoe> Is there any cleaner way to do this? http://jsbin.com/zusaropuwo/edit?html,js,console,output
[16:42:52] <jphase-lunch> Zeranoe: sure, I wrote a function that works a bit better: http://robido.com/jquery/jquery-method-force-numeric-input-element-cmd-ctrl-actions-allow-select-page-refresh/
[16:43:53] <Zeranoe> jphase-lunch: I need an alpha only one too
[16:44:33] <jphase-lunch> Zeranoe: it would be the same, but you'd inverse all the conditions in the if
[16:45:18] <jphase-lunch> oh, right I have the extra keys
[16:45:19] <jphase-lunch> sec
[16:50:49] <naftilos76> Hi i am using .bind() to send a parameter in an anonymous function but i get the impression that after doing that obj this is undefined. Is that supposed to be true or is it me making a mistake?
[16:51:04] <duch_kazatel> wut
[16:51:13] <duch_kazatel> that's not how that works.
[16:51:22] <VictorCL> naftilos76 show code
[16:51:26] <duch_kazatel> .bind() takes two args - context and arguments to pass through.
[16:51:31] <duch_kazatel> the first arg becomes the new "this"
[16:51:57] <duch_kazatel> usually you just pass 'this', but your use of it is a little awkward.  why are you sending parameters to an anonymous function like that in the first place?
[16:52:14] <naftilos76> duch_kazatel, so what am i supposed to put in bind?
[16:53:13] <duch_kazatel> that depends entirely on the situation.
[16:53:17] <duch_kazatel> what are you using it for?
[16:53:34] <jphase-lunch> Zeranoe: do you want to allow spaces as well?
[16:54:49] <naftilos76> duch_kazatel, the anonymous func i am sending the params to is sent as a param to a checkbox.bind("change", function(){}.bind(param1));
[16:55:48] <duch_kazatel> so...
[16:55:51] <duch_kazatel> that's not a good idea.
[16:55:59] <charles382> hey dutch_kazatel, when you've got a moment could you look at this again? https://jsfiddle.net/r793guo0/3/ im trying to add an instruction that if its fading out after 800, it should fade out immediately, if its fading out below 150, it should fade out slowly (normally). i think i might have a typo or something somewhere, it doesn't appear to work (what i've done)
[16:56:00] <naftilos76> duch_kazatel, does that make any sense in that form?
[16:56:13] <duch_kazatel> first off, jquery's .bind() is deprecated in favor on .on()
[16:56:25] <duch_kazatel> second off, don't pass args to event handlers.
[16:56:46] <duch_kazatel> charles382 wtf is up wiuth your code formatting?
[16:56:49] <naftilos76> duch_kazatel, ok you are right... let me re-think things over
[16:57:20] <duch_kazatel> charles382 also, check your console.
[16:57:26] <duch_kazatel> pretty clear what the issue is.
[16:57:41] <duch_kazatel> you have if (somecondition) {} else {} else {}
[16:57:45] <duch_kazatel> can't nest the way you are right now.
[16:58:26] <duch_kazatel> charles382 you want something closer to https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/r793guo0/4/
[16:59:57] <charles382> thats it dude, i just swapped around the slow and 0 values and its doing what i want
[17:00:07] <charles382> as i said, new to javascript, just learned about 'else if' haha
[17:00:13] <charles382> not else { if, duh
[17:00:22] <charles382> the sentiment was there ;)
[17:00:25] <duch_kazatel> you can nest that way, but it wasn't what you wanted.
[17:00:26] <duch_kazatel> also: http://learn.jquery.com/
[17:00:34] <duch_kazatel> check that out - it might be helpful.
[17:00:42] <charles382> thanks dude

[17:02:14] <duch_kazatel> that won't exist.

[17:02:43] <jphase> well, it does exist but it's a paid/trial service - browserstack.com
[17:02:50] <duch_kazatel> that's not an online emulator.
[17:02:57] <jphase> not an emulator at all
[17:03:00] <duch_kazatel> exactly.

[17:11:23] <charles382> hey duch_kazatel , one last and final question and i'll stop bothering you :p. https://jsfiddle.net/r793guo0/5/ when it fades back in at 870, how do i make that also fade in duration 0 seconds?
[17:11:42] <charles382> (so the only slow fade outs are at the top of the page basically)
[17:12:04] <duch_kazatel> uh
[17:12:07] <duch_kazatel> your code is strange.
[17:12:12] <duch_kazatel> your last conditional replicates the first.
[17:12:21] <duch_kazatel> and i don't see anything w/r/t over 870
[17:13:52] <charles382> try this https://jsfiddle.net/r793guo0/6/
[17:15:01] <jangoh> i have another issue top left images seems loads twice here www.vitrina.co.il
[17:16:55] <duch_kazatel> charles382...
[17:17:09] <duch_kazatel> read through that code.  the last else if vs the first if
[17:17:34] <charles382> roger that
[17:18:01] <duch_kazatel> jangoh what?
[17:18:16] <duch_kazatel> "seem to load twice"?
[17:19:42] <charles382> im stumped, if i change it it doesnt fade in at the start anymore
[17:23:22] <duch_kazatel> do you see where your code doesn't make sense?
[17:23:46] <duch_kazatel> think about it - ($document.scrollTop() > 100 && $document.scrollTop() < 870) vs ($document.scrollTop() < 870)
[17:23:49] <charles382> yeh i think so
[17:23:53] <charles382> i copied yours, https://jsfiddle.net/r793guo0/6/
[17:24:08] <charles382> and it was fading out instantly at the top, i wanted it at the bottom so i swapped the values and it worked
[17:24:09] <duch_kazatel> in what case will something be less than 870, but between 100 and 870?>
[17:26:49] <charles382> argh idk
[17:29:06] <charles382> duch_kazatel do you see what i mean?
[17:29:22] <duch_kazatel> i see your issue and i'm helping you learn to fish :)
[17:29:38] <duch_kazatel> basically, define all your limits - if < 100, else if > 100 and < 870, else if > 870
[17:36:20] * jangoh sorry got dc anyone have idea why my site's top left 2 images seems loads twice http://www.vitrina.co.il/
[17:36:41] <jangoh> sorry got dc anyone have idea why my site's top left 2 images seems loads twice http://www.vitrina.co.il/
[17:39:23] <taplar> jangoh, why do you think they load twice?
[17:41:10] <jangoh> see they load twice
[17:41:28] <taplar> no, i don't see.  that's why i'm asking what your seeing that makes you think that
[17:41:48] <taplar> in my ff network tab, both why.jpg and join.jpg only list once
[17:43:26] <jangoh> but refrsh the page you will see after loading the page those 2 images seems loading again
[17:44:03] <taplar> same thing for me
[17:44:04] <duch_kazatel> jangoh so you mean it doesn't seem like they're caching?
[17:44:17] <taplar> the request for them are returning a 304, they are caching
[17:44:22] <duch_kazatel> jangoh why does it seem like they're loading again?
[17:45:30] <jangoh> they disappear then loads
[17:46:16] <taplar> ?  refresh rebuilds the entire page
[17:47:29] <kegster> what would be the best way to automatically horizontally scroll divs infinitely through a parent div? maybe like 2 rows of logos but offset to lay out like bricks or something
[17:48:30] <kegster> kind of like this: http://coolcarousels.frebsite.nl/c/23/
[17:48:37] <jangoh> taplar yes check those 2 images disappear then loads again
[17:49:03] <taplar> jangoh, right.... that's what refresh does
[17:49:20] <duch_kazatel> jangoh you're confused about how images and layout works.
[17:49:26] <duch_kazatel> that's going to happen.
[17:49:35] <duch_kazatel> the images are not "reloading", the page is just being refreshed.
[17:49:38] <taplar> i feel trolled, lol
[17:49:52] <duch_kazatel> kegster soooo.... that's kind of a bad idea.
[17:49:52] <taplar> crap, laundry.  *runs*
[17:50:02] <jangoh> duch_kazatel yes
[17:50:03] <kegster> duch_kazatel, what do you mean?
[17:50:14] <duch_kazatel> kegster  carousels are generally something you should avoid.
[17:50:24] <duch_kazatel> end users basically ignore anything that even looks remotely like a carousel.
[17:50:28] <kegster> i understand this
[17:50:42] <duch_kazatel> especially if the content is automatically moving like that.  that being said, why not just use what you see on that page?
[17:51:20] <kegster> yeah. it's needed though for bells and whistles for an interactive thing. nothing really web facing
[17:51:24] <kegster> public, at least
[17:52:07] <PurePandemonium> oh I see what he means now. The big images do flicker when you refresh
[17:52:19] <duch_kazatel> PurePandemonium right, because the page is doing its whole "rendering" thing.
[17:57:39] <taplar> carousels without the option to stop them are annoying
[17:57:49] <taplar> imho
[17:58:00] <duch_kazatel> if it's an internal tool, meh.
[17:58:06] <duch_kazatel> still annoying, but whatevs.
[17:58:17] <duch_kazatel> brb
[18:00:18] <plamb> that feel when "unexpected identifier" but doesnt point to any code
[18:00:36] <taplar> hmm?
[18:00:57] <plamb> hey taplar
[18:01:01] <plamb> had to run yesterday
[18:01:04] <plamb> not sure if you responded
[18:01:05] <taplar> bonjour
[18:01:19] <plamb> still working on this
[18:01:21] <plamb> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/pdaom92e/4/
[18:01:42] <plamb> getting an unexpected identifier exception in the console
[18:01:50] <plamb> everything seems to be single quotes doe
[18:02:05] <taplar> well first thing i see just pulling it up its complaining about missing ;
[18:02:25] <plamb> ah
[18:04:14] <plamb> its saying this line has an unexpected identifier
[18:04:16] <plamb> $('.top')on('click', '.edit-image', function() {
[18:04:21] <plamb> oh
[18:04:23] <plamb> missing a period
[18:04:24] <plamb> L!l
[18:04:39] <taplar> :)
[18:04:57] <plamb> wtf it stills says it
[18:04:59] <plamb> $('.top').on('click', '.edit-image', function() {
[18:05:05] <plamb> looks fine to me
[18:05:34] <plamb> oh maybe i just had to update
[18:06:28] <taplar> ok, i remember making a statement about this yesterday, but i thought about it more and i disagreed with myself, heh
[18:06:29] <taplar> so
[18:06:32] <taplar> top
[18:06:34] <plamb> nice
[18:06:40] <taplar> is there going to be only one of these guys?
[18:06:44] <plamb> here is most updated with no errors
[18:06:46] <plamb> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/pdaom92e/5/
[18:06:54] <plamb> yeah the template only creates one .top
[18:07:02] <plamb> it could be an id
[18:07:10] <taplar> no, i mean layout wise
[18:07:31] <plamb> im not sure what you mean
[18:07:35] <taplar> i see you have multiple of these blocks in one single top element
[18:07:41] <plamb> oh
[18:07:56] <plamb> there may be one or two more in the .top element
[18:08:08] <plamb> just havent moved the html into jsfiddle to keep things simple
[18:08:35] <taplar> ok, in that case I would say it would be better to wrap each 'section' in another element, maybe another span, and do your delegate bind to that
[18:08:54] <plamb> by section do you mean editable element
[18:09:09] <taplar> view-block, edit-block collection
[18:09:24] <plamb> oh
[18:09:31] <plamb> any set of those wrapped in their own span
[18:09:52] <taplar> yeah cause what your going to run into is the event bubbles up to top, and then it looks for .view-block and it's going to find multiple
[18:09:58] <plamb> and each outer span has its own id?
[18:10:02] <taplar> class
[18:10:33] <plamb> so you bind $('.outerclass').on('click', '.edit-image'.....
[18:10:40] <taplar> yup, instead of .top
[18:11:12] <plamb> if you had to chose between
[18:11:22] <plamb> simplest HTML, simplest CSS or simplest jquery
[18:11:25] <plamb> which would you chose
[18:11:32] <taplar> jquery
[18:11:35] <plamb> i see
[18:11:37] <plamb> why?
[18:11:40] <taplar> it's logic
[18:11:43] <taplar> html is markup
[18:12:58] <plamb> i see
[18:14:30] <plamb> taplar you think with the added span's
[18:14:40] <plamb> i'd still need to differentiate between edit-image and edit-text
[18:14:56] <plamb> prob since they'd be classes and not id's
[18:15:05] <taplar> i think it will be a good idea, you don't have to, but with the new span it will be generic enough to work with both
[18:15:12] <taplar> given the multiple in the top
[18:15:48] <taplar> when ever your making markup that is sorta templating, if you will, classes are usually the way to go
[18:16:00] <plamb> right
[18:16:09] <taplar> the more html/javascript i do i find i'm more often having to find a reason to use an id, not defaulting to one
[18:16:53] <plamb> following your former principle, we want our jquery to be as succinct and general as possible
[18:17:07] <plamb> so it makes sense
[18:17:12] <taplar> generic = reusable
[18:17:30] <plamb> even if it costs some complexity in html/css
[18:17:37] <taplar> sure
[18:18:00] <taplar> dom only loads the html once per draw, after that your just manipulating the dom
[18:19:05] <taplar> but i mean, there's always an edge of course.  you can always go too crazy
[18:19:22] <plamb> a single line of jquery for 18 pages of html
[18:19:27] <plamb> :)
[18:19:35] <taplar> depends on what that one line does, ;)
[18:20:16] <taplar> $(body).find('.fieldWithError').eq(0).focus();
[18:20:35] <taplar> could work on all of your pages
[18:25:28] <plamb> alright taplar
[18:25:30] <plamb> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/pdaom92e/7/
[18:25:31] <plamb> new span's
[18:25:56] <taplar> k, lets see
[18:27:01] <taplar> ok, one thing you should do is cache your $(this).  since your doing it alot
[18:27:14] <plamb> how do you do that
[18:27:20] <plamb> var lol = $(this) >
[18:27:22] <plamb> ?
[18:27:25] <taplar> yeah
[18:27:52] <plamb> the .closest appears to be grabbing the right element
[18:28:09] <taplar> yeah, just looking into why the image and all is disappearing
[18:28:27] <taplar> oh
[18:28:54] <taplar> find your closest .edit-elements and do your view/edit find off of that
[18:29:34] <plamb> makes sense
[18:31:02] <plamb> hmmm
[18:31:04] <plamb> like this?
[18:31:05] <plamb> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/pdaom92e/8/
[18:31:13] <plamb> err
[18:31:25] <plamb> should it be $editElements.find('.edit-block')
[18:31:27] <taplar> closest is like a find upwards
[18:31:34] <taplar> backtracking through parents
[18:31:37] <taplar> find goes down
[18:31:40] <plamb> i see
[18:31:57] <taplar> closest will only find one though, the first parent that matches
[18:32:16] <plamb> edit is working, save isnt yet
[18:32:23] <plamb> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/pdaom92e/9/
[18:33:05] <plamb> oh
[18:33:06] <plamb> i see why
[18:33:07] <taplar> yeah, so your save is pretty much the same as your edit, but swapping the variable setting and the show/hide
[18:34:12] <plamb> so the imagine works but the text doesnt
[18:34:18] <plamb> probably because of my if statement somehow
[18:34:23] <plamb> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/pdaom92e/10/
[18:34:26] <taplar> thats fine, lets see
[18:34:29] <kegster> so is there a way to scroll a tile-able background left or right continuously then?
[18:34:32] <plamb> image*
[18:34:48] <plamb> maybe i should do
[18:34:56] <plamb> if there are 2 inputs then...
[18:35:00] <plamb> instead of children
[18:35:00] <kegster> i guess just animate
[18:35:25] <taplar> ok, so now the text version are pretty much the same, except your not going to be looking for a img tag, and your not going to be referencing it's prop('src')
[18:35:42] <plamb> right
[18:35:55] <plamb> i've already got them in there, i think they arent working because of my if conditional
[18:36:10] <plamb> which should be if (editBlock has two inputs) ... else (....
[18:36:17] <plamb> i think
[18:36:23] <taplar> what's that if testing?
[18:36:28] <lalalaaa> Hi! Is there a prettier way to write this so it doesn't look so crammed? http://jsfiddle.net/qvh80yj9/
[18:36:43] <plamb> well person.name only has 1 input for edit/save
[18:36:48] <plamb> the next one down ahs two
[18:36:56] <taplar> !g javascript switch
[18:36:57] <plamb> so i test so i can display either 1 or two inputs
[18:37:29] <taplar> lalalaaa, http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_switch.asp
[18:37:39] <taplar> is an option
[18:37:47] <lalalaaa> ooooh
[18:37:52] <lalalaaa> that looks gorgeous :)
[18:38:06] <plamb> if($editBlock.children('input') = 2)
[18:38:47] <taplar> so you want to edit two at a time?
[18:38:53] <plamb> right
[18:38:56] <taplar> hmm
[18:38:58] <plamb> for the title, company case
[18:39:26] <plamb> hmm console is saying this is invalid
[18:39:27] <plamb> if($editBlock.children('input') = 2)
[18:39:32] <plamb> does it need to be ==
[18:39:51] <taplar> .length and ==
[18:40:02] <taplar> probably want > 1
[18:40:57] <maletor> are there any other events that fire after changing a select box besides change?
[18:40:57] <taplar> and that's going to have a querk to it
[18:41:03] <plamb> why
[18:41:09] <plamb> what is the best way to test that there
[18:41:11] <maletor> i need to blur a select box after it changes and after it doesn't change
[18:41:13] <taplar> because your going to have to know which input value goes to which text
[18:41:21] <taplar> and vise versa
[18:41:21] <duch_kazatel> maletor you want change.
[18:41:22] <duch_kazatel> trust me.
[18:41:32] <maletor> duch_kazatel: then how do i blur after it doesn't change?
[18:41:32] <plamb> well one is in a p, and one is in an a inside the p
[18:41:42] <duch_kazatel> maletor huh?
[18:41:55] <duch_kazatel> maletor how can you blur the input if nothing happened?>
[18:41:56] <maletor> ya, i want to blur the select box after the value changes AND after it doesn't change
[18:42:07] <duch_kazatel> how does the input not change?
[18:42:10] <plamb> im using input:first-of-type to grab the first one for example
[18:42:22] <maletor> i basically need to set teh box to the pseduo css class that is not active
[18:42:25] <duch_kazatel> maletor and why do you want it to blur?
[18:42:41] <maletor> the select does not first change if the value doesn't change
[18:42:50] <maletor> :s/first/fire
[18:42:51] <taplar> looking at your markup i think you need a wrapper around your @person.name
[18:42:51] <duch_kazatel> wat
[18:43:03] <taplar> err, sorry, hold on
[18:43:13] <plamb> its in a <h3>
[18:43:15] <taplar> @person.title
[18:43:19] <duch_kazatel> maletor but nothing changed, so why are you reacting to something that didn't happen?
[18:43:27] <ashgotti> Evening. I need a bit of help with scroll positions. I have a form that can be saved any time during the process. Once hte page reloads, the user is back at hte top of the page. I'm storing their scrolling position when they click "save" and take the user back there when the page reloads. It works but the problem is when I leave and come back, open an existing form, I'm taken to my last position where I click save rather than at the top.
[18:43:32] <plamb> its wrapper is <p> which i know is sorta ugly
[18:43:34] <maletor> duch_kazatel: because my designers are retarded
[18:43:41] <maletor> and have this in a css pseduo class
[18:43:47] <duch_kazatel> hey that work isn't okay - please don't use it. thanks!
[18:43:48] <taplar> right, but it's plain text in that, with element siblings
[18:43:53] <plamb> :(
[18:43:55] <taplar> if you want to change it, that's going to be ugly
[18:43:57] <duch_kazatel> maletor can you make a fiddle showing what you're trying to do?
[18:44:14] <duch_kazatel> maletor because i'm not understanding something here.
[18:44:16] <ashgotti> I'm using localStorage. I guess I can try sessionStorage
[18:44:24] <plamb> i wish i'd designed it to have the icons and <a> outside of the <p> but now i get this technical debt
[18:44:33] <duch_kazatel> ashgotti why not use ajax instead to submit the form?
[18:44:38] <taplar> but that's later, lets get the person.name working
[18:44:48] <lalalaaa> taplar: this look ok? https://gist.github.com/dt1973/30f0eaf54ea60c35e224
[18:44:56] <ashgotti> duch_kazatel: I'm using Drupal so I'm a bit limited with how I can submit the form.
[18:44:57] <lalalaaa> taplar: not sure what expression in switch(expression) should be so..
[18:45:09] <taplar> lalalaaa, the expression is what your testing
[18:45:19] <duch_kazatel> ashgotti you could submit that value as apart of the form and then spit that back out to scroll.
[18:45:52] <plamb> the conditional works
[18:46:02] <ashgotti> duch_kazatel: I don't really understand
[18:46:15] <ashgotti> oh, wait, nm like in a hidden field?
[18:46:18] <duch_kazatel> bingo
[18:46:22] <plamb> oh
[18:46:23] <ashgotti> :)
[18:46:27] <duch_kazatel> a non-required one.
[18:46:51] <ashgotti> yup, that would work. would using sessionStorage instead of localStorage be an alternative?
[18:46:52] <taplar> lalalaaa, http://jsfiddle.net/8oonsnqd/
[18:47:10] <duch_kazatel> ashgotti i wouldn't rely on those, but i guess you could.
[18:47:20] <duch_kazatel> why are you taking the user back to where they left off in this case, though?
[18:47:20] <ashgotti> duch_kazatel, ok thanks!
[18:47:46] <ashgotti> The form is very long. They may save their progress so I don't want them to have to save and then scroll to find where they were
[18:47:53] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[18:48:05] <duch_kazatel> i'd force some kind of pagination instead.
[18:48:08] <taplar> brb
[18:48:09] <plamb> ok the conditional works, its grabbing the right .text()
[18:48:26] <ashgotti> duch_kazatel: I agree, client wants one long form
[18:48:34] <duch_kazatel> then ditch the progress saving.
[18:48:45] <plamb> oh i forgot the .hide().show()
[18:49:07] <ashgotti> duch_kazatel, it's required because of how they tend to work. They don't complete it in one setting either because of how long it takes or they may not have all the info at htat point
[18:49:12] <lalalaaa> taplar_brb: doesnt look like anything i could use to simplify http://jsfiddle.net/qvh80yj9/1/ to be honest
[18:49:32] <lalalaaa> i mean i have a bunch of ifs.. that switch looks to test multiple cases of a single if
[18:49:47] <lalalaaa> if im not mistaken, but i probably am
[18:49:59] <duch_kazatel> ashgotti so you're not really saving progress, you're creating and editing a record?
[18:50:09] <plamb> taplar: works http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/pdaom92e/15/
[18:50:16] <duch_kazatel> lalalaaa this code is... strange.
[18:50:21] <ashgotti> duch_kazatel: sorry, yes "Saving" is internal lingo. It's writing to the DB but bypassing validation.
[18:50:36] <duch_kazatel> ashgotti i'm talking about from a UX perspective :)  it's more like creating/editing a record.
[18:50:40] <duch_kazatel> instead of saving progress.
[18:50:48] <ashgotti> duch_kazatel: that's right
[18:50:55] <duch_kazatel> fair enough :)
[18:51:09] <duch_kazatel> lalalaaa can you illustrate a real use case for this?
[18:51:25] <duch_kazatel> lalalaaa because code like this is sympomatic of other issues.
[18:52:52] <taplar> numba 15! k
[18:53:13] <lalalaaa> duch_kazatel: just looking to run my iscroll on some specific variables.. https://gist.github.com/dt1973/30f0eaf54ea60c35e224 .. this is all cosmetic though, i just think it looks a bit messy :)
[18:53:27] <duch_kazatel> err.
[18:53:35] <taplar> plamb, you might trim the text before you put it in the input
[18:53:41] <duch_kazatel> lalalaaa give more context.
[18:54:00] <duch_kazatel> lalalaaa the globalVar is telling here.
[18:55:05] <lalalaaa> sorry i dont really have a problem was just looking for different ways to express this, hoping maybe a shorthand could make it look more elegant
[18:55:08] <lalalaaa> but i digress
[18:55:14] <lalalaaa> let the people here with real problems grab your attention
[18:55:29] <duch_kazatel> lalalaaa err, this is a real problem :)
[18:55:40] <duch_kazatel> there's an architectural issue here.
[18:56:44] <lalalaaa> lol
[18:56:47] <lalalaaa> its fine =)
[18:56:53] <duch_kazatel> uh, okay?
[18:57:13] <duch_kazatel> i really wish i understood why people do that.
[18:57:24] <taplar> hmm?
[18:57:47] <duch_kazatel> "hey so i need some help with this thing"
[18:57:58] <duch_kazatel> "okay well let's dig in and get some context"
[18:58:05] <duch_kazatel> "nvm it's not a real problem anyway"
[18:58:20] <taplar> heh
[18:58:44] <lalalaaa> i was just wondering if there was a shorthand
[18:58:47] <duch_kazatel> like... then why ask?
[18:58:56] <lalalaaa> no need to spend hours explaining what i need it for
[18:59:00] <duch_kazatel> lalalaaa no.  there is no shorthand, but that could be greatly improved upon.
[18:59:07] <duch_kazatel> i'm not asking for hours of your time though.
[18:59:37] <taplar> i think some people have a fear of going down the rabbit hole of refactoring, so it's avoided
[18:59:38] <duch_kazatel> that's the thing - that code screams "there's an issue elsewhere", but you're being particular about your feedback.  just strange.
[19:01:10] <duch_kazatel> i love being told my code sucks or there's a better way or whatever.
[19:02:26] <Distraught> hello http://pastebin.com/qb8MAHyQ
[19:02:39] <Distraught> I want to know when the posturl finishes it's proccess
[19:02:41] <Distraught> is that possible?
[19:02:45] <duch_kazatel> Distraught yes - .done()
[19:02:53] <duch_kazatel> $.post().done(function() {});
[19:03:03] <taplar> and do e.preventDefault() not return false
[19:03:18] <Distraught> serialize is correct there?
[19:03:21] <duch_kazatel> taplar fwiw return false does more than e.preventDefault();
[19:03:28] <taplar> the stopProp
[19:03:38] <duch_kazatel> Distraught https://api.jquery.com/serialize/ yep.
[19:07:20] <Distraught> http://pastebin.com/BAceLHTb this is a correct approach? if I add prevent default before
[19:07:28] <duch_kazatel> err.
[19:07:33] <Distraught> hm
[19:07:39] <duch_kazatel> you're confused :)
[19:07:45] <Distraught> a little
[19:07:46] <Distraught> :S
[19:08:32] <duch_kazatel> so you don't need to use that var if you don't want.
[19:08:43] <Distraught> oh
[19:09:05] <duch_kazatel> one sec let me show you.
[19:09:11] <Distraught> jquery.done
[19:09:15] <Distraught> so it is i guess
[19:09:21] <duch_kazatel> like, what you've got works.
[19:09:25] <duch_kazatel> just don't have to do it that way.
[19:09:31] <duch_kazatel> but your code's formatted wrong :)
[19:09:31] <Distraught> oh
[19:09:38] <Distraught> :S
[19:09:44] <duch_kazatel> also - why jQuery and not $?
[19:10:18] <Distraught> y i thought it was obvious (but its not if you re talking to a noob like me ) so you re right
[19:10:19] <Distraught> :D
[19:10:32] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[19:10:44] <Distraught> hrm?
[19:10:46] <duch_kazatel> https://bpaste.net/show/103ba3f24e37 so this will work.
[19:10:51] <Distraught> ok
[19:10:51] <duch_kazatel> and i didn't understand your last sentence at all.
[19:11:06] <Distraught> oh. Noob is newbie (something like that)
[19:11:12] <duch_kazatel> lol
[19:11:13] <taplar> Distraught, are you writing this logic for no conflict mode?
[19:11:35] <duch_kazatel> i know what noob is - i meant i didn't understand what you meant by the "i thought it was obvious".  thought what was obvious?
[19:12:32] <Distraught> I thought that I should use $ before jquery . But again. I m noob. So it's not obvious. It 's just stupid
[19:12:33] <Distraught> hahaha
[19:12:50] <duch_kazatel> ok.  guess i don't understand where that idea came from.
[19:12:51] <duch_kazatel> but okay :)
[19:15:26] <Distraught> it seems that it works
[19:15:31] <Distraught> thank you duch_kazatel !
[19:15:37] <duch_kazatel> see the differences
[19:15:38] <duch_kazatel> ?
[19:15:49] <Distraught> really thank you. Now i ll read what you ve done there
[19:17:33] <Distraught> But it does not work as expected
[19:17:34] <Distraught> :D
[19:17:36] <Distraught> hehe
[19:17:40] <duch_kazatel> so what's wrong?
[19:18:04] <Distraught> It does the same thing with the previous one. Maybe in a correct way
[19:18:09] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle.
[19:18:30] <Distraught> it has to do with a php script
[19:18:37] <duch_kazatel> oh, then fix the php :)
[19:18:40] <Distraught> hahaha
[19:19:04] <Distraught> Well the point is that when the php script ends the process then it will give the answer to jquery
[19:19:08] <Distraught> isn't that possible?
[19:19:16] <duch_kazatel> "ends the process"?
[19:19:26] <Distraught> it inserts in database lots of values
[19:19:35] <Distraught> so some times it took 4-5 seconds to do that
[19:19:48] <Distraught> and jquery showed that it had finished
[19:19:52] <Distraught> immediatelly
[19:20:01] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you need to tell php to wait?
[19:20:15] <duch_kazatel> that's kind of out of the purview of the channel.
[19:20:15] <Distraught> no it's the exact opposite
[19:20:17] <duch_kazatel> maybe check ##php
[19:20:33] <duch_kazatel> actually, it's not.  jquery fires .done() as soon as the request successfully completes.
[19:20:40] <duch_kazatel> so php needs to not immediately respond.
[19:20:49] <duch_kazatel> so i'd ask in ##php what you need to do.
[19:20:52] <Distraught> no wait. The script just passes one var to php. The php inserts from other sources to the database.
[19:21:04] <Distraught> I need to get a response when the php script is finihed
[19:21:07] <Distraught> finished
[19:21:12] <Distraught> not the jquery
[19:21:16] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[19:21:20] <duch_kazatel> that's what i've been saying this entire time :)
[19:21:24] <Distraught> oh
[19:21:33] <Distraught> so I need to do that in my php script ?
[19:21:35] <taplar> typically ajax will wait for a php script to finish
[19:21:45] <duch_kazatel> Distraught and again
[19:21:47] <taplar> unless your doing something strange in your script
[19:21:47] <duch_kazatel> ask in ##php
[19:21:54] <Distraught> ok guys
[19:21:57] <Distraught> thank you
[19:22:08] <Distraught> for your time, advices and fixes :D
[19:42:45] <LindsayMac> i'm having a hard time figuring out how to get the first name with this JSON result http://pastebin.com/A81sAGQz
[19:43:15] <taplar> which one?
[19:43:16] <LindsayMac> I thought simply response.firstname would grab the firstname value for each item in the list but it doesnt. I don't know why i'm brain stuck on this!
[19:43:35] <taplar> if you want them all, you'll need to map it
[19:44:16] <LindsayMac> taplar:  who are you talking to?
[19:44:18] <taplar> you
[19:44:36] <LindsayMac> ok.. it wasn't clear since you didnt use my name and I have no reference for the convo that was happening here before me
[19:44:42] <LindsayMac> map it how?
[19:45:12] <taplar> $.map( arrayVariable, function( index, element) { return this.firstname; });
[19:45:52] <taplar> err
[19:46:03] <taplar> $.map( arrayVariable, function() { return this.firstname; });
[19:46:09] <taplar> no need for params if i used 'this'
[19:46:58] <LindsayMac> got it. thanks
[19:49:09] <lindsaym_> Weird. I get "cannot use "in" operator to search 87 ... Taplar
[19:49:49] <taplar> lindsaym_, what are you trying to do?
[19:49:56] <duch_kazatel> code?
[19:59:00] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac it looks liek you're trying to use for in.
[20:11:54] <ashgotti> Evening. I need some help with adding two fields. I have multiple instances of "years" and "months". When any of them are edited, I'd like to add them all up. I think I know why it's not working but I don't know how to fix it http://pastebin.com/xUMAxEGm
[20:12:06] <duch_kazatel> can you make a fiddle instead?
[20:12:07] <ashgotti> I'm trying to use .each since I need to loop through all instances of both fields
[20:12:14] <ashgotti> I can try
[20:13:52] <ashgotti> http://jsfiddle.net/gna8d1ae/
[20:14:18] <duch_kazatel> so first off, you want .map()
[20:14:40] <ashgotti> to google I go!
[20:14:48] <duch_kazatel> i can show you where to start.
[20:15:16] <ashgotti> thank you again for all the help tonight
[20:18:37] <duch_kazatel> almost done sorry :)
[20:19:21] <ashgotti> I'm just looking up examples of .map in the meantime
[20:19:41] <duch_kazatel> you want jquery's .map() with the .get() chained onto it.
[20:19:56] <ashgotti> I undertand it can manipulate arrays so I'm guessing that I'm going ot add the values to an array and hten add htem up?
[20:20:37] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gna8d1ae/2/
[20:20:40] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[20:20:48] <duch_kazatel> .map() the values into an array, then reduce the array.
[20:20:50] <Guest123456666> yo, looking to hire a developer to code a simple jquery/ajax app - pls query if available
[20:20:58] <duch_kazatel> Guest123456666 not the right place to ask :)
[20:21:04] <duch_kazatel> check out a freelance channel instea.d
[20:21:06] <Guest123456666> ahh
[20:21:10] <Guest123456666> which one?
[20:21:16] <duch_kazatel> dunno.
[20:21:19] <duch_kazatel> good luck :)
[20:21:23] <Guest123456666> thnx
[20:21:53] <ashgotti> duch_kazatel Like htis? http://jsfiddle.net/Y4bHh/ <— found it
[20:21:57] <ashgotti> duch_kazatel thanks again!
[20:22:04] <duch_kazatel> errr, not at all.
[20:22:16] <duch_kazatel> .reduce()
[20:22:46] <ashgotti> sorry, just the application of map and get
[20:22:53] <duch_kazatel> oh, yeah.
[20:23:03] <duch_kazatel> that.  the .get() gives you a plain array to work with.
[20:23:09] <duch_kazatel> the jquery docs explain it.
[20:23:19] <ashgotti> :) learning so much tonight
[20:52:30] <Kamuela> How do I target “where ‘data-name’ attribute is equal to?
[20:53:00] <Kamuela> $(‘[data-name]’) it’s something like that but not sure full syntax
[20:53:27] <taplar> $(tagSelector).find(function(){ return $(this).data('name') == 'whatever'; })
[20:53:41] <Kamuela> oh it is a bit more complicated than I thought
[20:54:01] <taplar> try to avoid attribute selectors in finders
[20:54:22] <Kamuela> what’s the reason there?
[20:54:32] <taplar> it's been said that sizzle, the engine that jquery uses to process these, can be slow with them
[20:54:56] <Kamuela> I can imagine it is slow, since doing it in vanilla is convoluted
[20:55:13] <taplar> it's also a potential dom scan
[20:55:21] <taplar> instead of a simple tag or element lookup
[20:56:08] <Kamuela> are DOM elements interchangeable between jQuery and vanilla? e.g. can let testSelector = document.getElementById(‘test-selector’) but then used like $(testSelector)?
[20:56:20] <taplar> yes
[20:56:36] <taplar> $() can take a basic dom object and wrap it
[20:56:45] <taplar> that's pretty much what it is at it's core
[20:56:46] <Kamuela> thanks so much taplar
[20:57:13] <Kamuela> I think I’m dealing with cross browser issues with a current app so I’ve thrown in a bunch of // TODO: Update to jQuery all over the place lol
[20:57:22] <taplar> :)
[20:57:51] <Kamuela> ah but here’s one thing, a huge part of my app is dealing with an svgDoc. maybe jQuery can’t do it natively but are there plugins otherwise?
[20:58:05] <taplar> not sure
[20:58:19] <Kamuela> let’s see if Google is kind to me
[21:02:45] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela jquery and svg don't really mix.
[21:03:06] <duch_kazatel> there are plugins available that can help.
[21:03:25] <Kamuela> do you think if something is “working” with vanilla JS and SVG, that could be a source of modern browser inconsistency? or probably just old browsers?
[21:03:35] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[21:03:44] <duch_kazatel> so what's broken?
[21:03:44] <duch_kazatel> lol
[21:03:53] <Kamuela> I guess to be fair, I have no clue
[21:04:09] <Kamuela> I honestly think the guy’s internet connection just crapped out before he loaded the full SVG
[21:04:16] <duch_kazatel> so back way up.
[21:04:19] <Kamuela> in which case I’ll need to account for “loading…"
[21:04:47] <snover> no browser supports the full svg specification but there is no library that is going to help you with that
[21:04:49] <duch_kazatel> why do you think you're dealing with cross-browser problems?
[21:05:08] <Kamuela> I’m wondering if maybe the safari on his iPad was just too old
[21:05:25] <duch_kazatel> is he able to replicate the problem?
[21:05:35] <duch_kazatel> hell, can YOU replicate the problem?
[21:05:39] <Kamuela> fuck no
[21:05:54] <Kamuela> which is why I told him that to keep my sanity I’m going to call his an “edge case” and work on other stuff for now
[21:05:54] <Kamuela> lol
[21:06:04] <duch_kazatel> can he replicate it though?
[21:06:27] <Kamuela> he didn’t have all that much time today, but I guess we’ll find out when I have him try again in a few days
[21:06:40] <Kamuela> like I said I’m guessing the SVG just crapped out loading halfway through
[21:06:51] <Kamuela> It’s 300K not sure the issue there though
[21:07:10] <duch_kazatel> yeah, if he can't replicate i wouldn't worry about it.  also try to get the ios and browser versions and run with that.
[21:07:37] <Kamuela> I was thinking right now of running an event emitter for the load event
[21:07:43] <Kamuela> but like… is that just chasing my tail
[21:07:51] <Kamuela> is it work for nought I mean
[21:07:57] <snover> wat.
[21:08:47] <Kamuela> svgDoc.addEventListener(‘load’, () => { emitter.emit(’thesvgkinda_um_fuckingloadednow_carryon'});
[21:09:13] <snover> how does that make any sense
[21:09:28] <Kamuela> it means nothing else will try to work until the SVG loads, it’s a map so it’s pretty central
[21:09:54] <Kamuela> if you’re still confused maybe it helps to know i’m talking about separate react components and their communication
[21:11:06] <Kamuela> the work though is figuring out just how much that affects everything else
[21:11:14] <snover> well that is a little confusing since this is the jquery channel not the react channel :)
[21:13:07] <Kamuela> screw it. i’ll try it. worst case scenario i break everything
[21:13:18] <duch_kazatel> uh, okay.
[21:13:19] <duch_kazatel> lol
[21:32:34] <Sal> if i create a wrapper div, and then append to it an existing div , when i remove the wrapper, what will happen to the existing div?
[21:32:59] <duch_kazatel> the existing div stays.
[21:33:05] <Sal> appending it, will clone it, or will it move from its orginal node to the wrapper node?
[21:33:07] <duch_kazatel> you didn't do anything with it.
[21:33:09] <duch_kazatel> wut
[21:33:14] <duch_kazatel> check your question.
[21:33:25] <Sal> ok, let me explain better
[21:33:35] <duch_kazatel> or make a fiddle ;)
[21:33:52] <Sal> i have a piece of code loaded via ajax, and i insert it into a body level div
[21:34:01] <duch_kazatel> lol
[21:34:52] <Sal> in this code, there is a div that needs to become a popup
[21:34:58] <duch_kazatel> slow down.
[21:35:08] <duch_kazatel> explaining it like this never helps.
[21:35:08] <Sal> so i wante to wrap it with a backdrop div
[21:35:12] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mfv27nr1/
[21:35:14] <Sal> ok, sorry
[21:35:26] <duch_kazatel> .append() "moves" elements.
[21:35:33] <Sal> ok
[21:36:20] <duch_kazatel> see the fiddle i just shared?
[21:37:21] <Sal> yesm but i need to know what will happen when i remove the wrapper
[21:37:40] <duch_kazatel> given tht fiddle, what do you think?
[21:37:43] <Sal> do i have to put back di appended div before removing the wrapper?
[21:38:02] <duch_kazatel> is this "wrapper" your overlay for a modal?
[21:38:15] <Sal> yes
[21:38:17] <Sal> backdrop
[21:38:26] <Sal> full screen
[21:38:45] <Sal> then i ans position the popup div inside it
[21:38:47] <duch_kazatel> so 2 things: 1 - why aren't you using a modal library/plugin?
[21:38:57] <duch_kazatel> 2 - don't wrap your modal with the backdrop.,
[21:39:08] <Sal> because the usually only permit 1 modal open at a time
[21:39:28] <Sal> i have a modal open, and in this modal, i need to show a popup message
[21:39:35] <duch_kazatel> popups aren't modals.
[21:39:42] <duch_kazatel> is this a tooltip?
[21:39:46] <duch_kazatel> or something else?
[21:39:58] <Sal> dropdown on mouse click
[21:39:58] <duch_kazatel> and either way, your overlay doesn't need to be a parent of the modal.
[21:40:13] <duch_kazatel> none of what you've described requires more than one modal :)
[21:41:30] <Sal> all i want to do is abs position a div on a dark background div
[21:41:43] <duch_kazatel> right, and i'm telling you that's the wrong way to do a modal.
[21:41:50] <Sal> i have the div, so i was thinking on wrapping it into a layer
[21:42:04] <Sal> whats the ebst way then?
[21:42:14] <Sal> create 2 separate divs?
[21:42:18] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[21:42:29] <Sal> and show both but with different z-index
[21:42:33] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[21:43:29] <Sal> but i have a problem this way
[21:44:06] <Sal> that my popup is position absolute, and its not a body level, so it can have a parent with position relative before the body
[21:44:17] <duch_kazatel> then you need to fix your other markup.
[21:44:20] <Sal> so when i position it, it gets positioned on that parent
[21:45:16] <Sal> the other markup, is a modal like i said, so it has its own relative and absoluting stuff
[21:45:20] <Sal> damn
[21:45:24] <Sal> can't get out of this
[21:46:11] <Sal> the only way is to move popup at body level
[21:46:19] <duch_kazatel> which is the correct thing to do.
[21:46:25] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, use jqmodal or something similar.
[21:46:46] <Sal> it was hard to find a good modal code
[21:46:59] <Sal> most of them let background scroll when modal is open
[21:47:10] <duch_kazatel> you can usually fix that easily yourself.
[21:47:43] <Sal> and almost all of them, permit only 1 modal
[21:47:50] <Sal> and not a modal on a modal
[21:47:57] <duch_kazatel> because that's bad UX.
[21:48:04] <duch_kazatel> and nothing you've described requires two modals.
[21:48:19] <Sal> we all have divs on divs
[21:48:53] <Sal> i just wanted to make a unique function for every div that pops up
[21:49:11] <duch_kazatel> you shouldn't do that.
[21:49:12] <Sal> modal dialog, pull-down menu, tooltip, etc etc
[21:49:25] <duch_kazatel> uh - it sounds like you're rewriting every UI control.
[21:49:45] <Sal> i'm not using any ui framework
[21:49:55] <Sal> i don't want to look like others
[21:49:59] <duch_kazatel> i din't say anything about that.
[21:50:07] <duch_kazatel> but don't rewrite dropdowns and things.
[21:50:13] <duch_kazatel> that's a really Bad Idea™
[21:50:15] <Sal> i made my own following material design refs
[21:50:41] <Sal> material design, has different dropdowns from standard html
[21:50:58] <duch_kazatel> well aware - the way you're developing these things is backwards.
[21:51:04] <duch_kazatel> you're treating every element like a modal.
[21:51:05] <duch_kazatel> that's bad.
[21:51:49] <Sal> anyway, no, only dialogs, and drop down menus
[21:52:02] <duch_kazatel> dropdowns are not modals.
[21:52:07] <Sal> dialog have dark layers and dropdoiwn, transparent
[21:52:10] <duch_kazatel> i don't know why you'd ever treat them that way.
[21:52:19] <Sal> so when i both click outside, they close
[21:52:32] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't make any difference.
[21:52:37] <duch_kazatel> they aren't the same thing at all.
[21:52:57] <Sal> they're just divs on top of others
[21:53:09] <duch_kazatel> but they're not both modals.
[21:53:11] <Sal> even html makes its select using a popup
[21:53:19] <duch_kazatel> selects are NOT popups.
[21:53:32] <Sal> no, wait, i'm not talking about js modals
[21:53:33] <duch_kazatel> you're conflating things bigtime.
[21:53:54] <duch_kazatel> you're trying to equate select menus to "popups" or "modals".
[21:53:54] <Sal> for me a modal is a dialog with a dark backdrop
[21:54:00] <duch_kazatel> that's a modal to everybody.
[21:54:21] <Sal> ok, so its only a div on top of a dark div
[21:54:32] <Sal> and a menu, is a div on top of a transparent div
[21:54:37] <Sal> see, same thing
[21:54:40] <duch_kazatel> not at all.
[21:54:48] <duch_kazatel> you don't need the transparent div on the other one.
[21:54:49] <Sal> ok, i don't se4e the difference
[21:54:55] <duch_kazatel> that's clever, but ultimately really hacky code.
[21:55:08] <Sal> yes, or it wont close if i click outside
[21:55:16] <duch_kazatel> that's not true at all :)
[21:55:20] <Sal> and also, i need to block everything under
[21:55:32] <duch_kazatel> you need to learn about event bubbling and delegation.
[21:55:39] <duch_kazatel> the transparent div is entirely unnecessary.
[21:56:10] <duch_kazatel> but you're going to spend a lot of time arguing with me while i keep trying to point out that you're banging your head against the wall and asking why it hurts :)
[21:56:15] <duch_kazatel> i'm going home - enjoy :)
[22:10:47] <sdwrage> Hey all. Is there an easy way, on a select of multiple elements, to only get an array returned of a specific attribute?
[22:14:00] <Distraught> http://pastebin.com/gmQn13x1
[22:14:05] <Distraught> what am i doing wrong?
[22:14:34] <Distraught> I get a 404 on a file that is there
[22:15:18] <sdwrage> postUrl is incorrect then most likely
[22:15:26] <sdwrage> console.log(postUrl)
[22:15:54] <Distraught> its a var so
[22:18:33] <sdwrage> should be a string right
[22:18:34] <sdwrage> ?
[22:20:34] <Distraught> y
[22:47:26] <Pattrico> hi
[23:11:05] <Distraught> Is someone alive around here?
[23:11:07] <Distraught> http://pastebin.com/rBcfaKxC
[23:17:54] <nodist> yeah
[23:25:14] <Distraught> nodist http://pastebin.com/rBcfaKxC
[23:25:20] <Distraught> what am i doing wrong?
[23:25:32] <Distraught> It shows me a 404 of a file that exists
[23:27:33] <nodist> can't do alot with this, it would depend on the url and what your trying to post to
[23:33:33] <jim_j> hi
[23:34:17] <jim_j> I have several modals that open when I click on each thumbnail.  how do I ensure that the previously open modal closes when a new one is opened?
[23:43:11] <Kamuela> I just realized I’ve spent the last 5 hours with Chrome’s connection throttling on.
[23:43:19] <jim_j> can you check if a modal is open without knowing the div id?
[23:45:03] <Kamuela> if it has a particular class or some way you can reference it, e.g. 3 children down from a header or something
[23:45:11] <Kamuela> then you can check for display and visibility attributes
[23:47:39] <jim_j> Kamuela, I tried using:  $(".ui-dialog-content").dialog("close");  but then I can't open the modals I closed
[23:50:54] <pickandmix> $("#memory").load("portrait_breadtalk_memory.html"); doesn't work
[23:51:02] <pickandmix> Is there a problem with the line?
[23:52:02] <jim_j> how do you center a modal?
[23:56:51] <Pattt> i
[23:57:42] <Pattt> anyone got a few mins?
[23:58:52] <Pattt> forgot how to get fadeIn to work  http://jsfiddle.net/7Lyxsuaa/11/
