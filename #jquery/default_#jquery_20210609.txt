[16:18:12] <robertmaxrees> Northwoods cool
[16:18:20] <robertmaxrees> (it's helpful if you ask a question.
[16:20:18] <robertmaxrees> Northwoods it's also kind of strange to mix and match standard JS with jquery like that.
[16:20:40] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, right was just experimenting
[16:20:49] <robertmaxrees> so whatcha mean "append text to image"?
[16:21:00] <Northwoods> need to create img element and append text ( created through div )
[16:21:09] <robertmaxrees> when you say "append text", what do you mean?
[16:21:27] <robertmaxrees> you can't "append text" to an image.  do you mean you want to place text over the image?
[16:21:36] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, right
[16:21:51] <robertmaxrees> so you can't append it to the image.  but you can position the div over the image.
[16:22:02] <Northwoods> ok thats what i need
[16:22:09] <robertmaxrees> that's done via css :)
[16:22:15] <Northwoods> ok thanks
