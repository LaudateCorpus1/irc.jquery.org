[00:00:06] <tudda|awy> 1.7.2
[00:01:15] <didiergm> tudda|awy considering to upgrade ?
[00:01:35] <tudda|awy> I do very little in the site with jquery, was hoping to avoid it if possible... BUT, i'm willing to if it solves this problem
[00:02:14] <tudda|awy> i have a few plugins, but since this one page is the problem page, I'm willing to use a different version just for this one page for now.
[00:02:21] <tudda|awy> I'm at the "Whatever it takes to solve this problem" mode.
[00:02:42] <didiergm> tudda|awy  newer versions have done quite a bit on the event front. e.g. bind is now +/- deprecated and the advice is to use 'on'
[00:03:51] <tudda|awy> Is it realistic to expect hundreds of validators to process in a matter of seconds? or is this something jquery just cant do
[00:04:19] <didiergm> so you would do $('.form').on ... which is valid for now and any future  element having a class of .form
[00:04:21] <tudda|awy> because one of the problems is that event firing multiple times, but if i comment out that unbind and bind code, and just run the standard validation, with 40 entries, it STILL locks up
[00:05:32] <didiergm> tudda|awy it depends HOW the validation routines have been written. I should imagine that there would not be any lockup with 40 fields
[00:05:54] <gnarf> tudda|awy: if an event is being called twice, you are binding it twice
[00:05:57] <gnarf> period
[00:06:06] <didiergm> tudda|awy did u write the validation yourself or use a plugin ?
[00:06:11] <gnarf> is the code that binds the event inside of another event handler?
[00:06:33] <tudda|awy> I am just using the unobtrusive validation library. i havent actually written any validation code myself
[00:06:36] <gnarf> also, in 1.7 .off and .on should be safe
[00:06:52] <didiergm> gnarf, thanks I did not know
[00:07:13] <tudda|awy> The only reason i am rebinding this : $("form").bind("invalid-form.validate", function (form, validator) {        Is because I want to show the validation summary in a nice popup window.
[00:07:28] <tudda|awy> For simplicity sake, I have commented that code out (it was being unbound and bound in the DocumentReady for the page anyway)
[00:07:42] <gnarf> tudda|awy: have you looked at validate?
[00:07:50] <gnarf> `g site:plugins.jquery.com validate
[00:07:50] <b-ot> gnarf: validate | jQuery Plugin Registry → http://plugins.jquery.com/tag/validate/
[00:08:06] <gnarf> kinda easy to tell which one is popuplar there
[00:08:07] <gnarf> :)
[00:09:43] <tudda|awy> I guess the reason im hesitant to go test every validation library , is because it's a lot of work to redo this stuff and I don't know if its going to make any difference
[00:10:30] <tudda|awy> Is this library known to be faster then the unobstrusive library ?
[00:10:50] <coldhead> my mamma is known to be faster than the unobstrusive library
[00:10:54] <coldhead> oops wrong window
[00:11:29] <coldhead> tudda|awy: reluctance aside, you should just do whatever gnarf says. she's never wrong.
[00:11:59] <tudda|awy> actually, isn't this the same libary ?
[00:12:47] <tudda|awy> unobtrusive just uses different markup to register the rules int he jquery validation libary
[00:13:15] <tudda|awy> data-val-required="this is required" etc.  but ultimately, don't they both just use jquery.Validation?
[00:18:34] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:18:50] <Andrew_R> what's better? $('.ui-btn-add', $buttons) or $buttons.find('.ui-btn-add') ?
[00:19:14] <fabioportieri> it's more readable the latter
[00:19:57] <Andrew_R> I wonder if one is better performance-wise.
[00:20:40] <fabioportieri> i guess one is a wrapper for the other
[00:21:39] <okdamn> hey how do i apply a css font-size to the input placeholder in jquery?
[00:21:48] <okdamn> i mean, how do i select the placeholder?
[00:26:45] <tw2113> damn, no coldhead
[00:26:51] <Gazpacho> there is no separate style attribute for the placeholder value vs. a typed value
[00:27:32] <Gazpacho> just catch the user typing and change the style
[00:27:47] <okdamn> ok i fixed using css
[00:27:51] <okdamn> thanks
[00:27:56] <Gazpacho> i don't believe you
[00:28:00] <Gazpacho> liar
[00:38:11] <tw2113> ?tell coldhead message tw2113 when he gets a chance
[00:38:11] <b-ot> tw2113: I’ll tell coldhead about that.
[00:38:12] <bot-t> tw2113, Okay.
[00:41:36] <Andrew_R> so, I'm making something like this but more complicated: http://demo.codeofaninja.com/tutorials/move/index.php
[00:42:10] <Andrew_R> My lists won't be selects, because I need checkboxes (can move multiple at a time)
[00:42:25] <Andrew_R> where I'm stuck is figuring out how I am going to make these lists sorted
[00:42:27] <Andrew_R> any ideas?
[00:42:52] <fabioportieri> Andrew_R: just curios, why do you need that?
[00:43:21] <Andrew_R> because that's what the business requirements say? :p
[00:44:27] <Andrew_R> it will be used in several places, one use case is the "source" list will have a list of contacts you can email, and you select the people you want, move them to the "target" list and those users get the email
[00:44:49] <fabioportieri> Andrew_R: for what kind of application?
[00:45:00] <fabioportieri> ah i get it
[00:45:22] <Andrew_R> this is replacing an old asp.net webforms user control (which I think did postbacks to get back sorted data)
[00:45:32] <fabioportieri> i guess or you implement the sorting serverside or.. not
[00:46:38] <Andrew_R> I can send sorted data into the source and target lists to start with, but I'm not calling back to the server at all when the add/remove/add all/remove all buttons are clicked
[00:54:39] <Andrew_R> I guess it wasn't as hard as I thought: http://jsfiddle.net/N7At4/
[01:02:18] <iWrtCode> Hi all, I am using Jquery Ui draggable on a image. Here it works fine http://jsfiddle.net/roXon/hMmbK/2/. When I used this in local, dragable is omitting containment value, When I move image, it is going to top.
[01:18:40] <tudda|awy> So ive gotten a bit further, maybe someone can give me a nudge in the right direction.   When I click my button, i call  $("form").removeData("validator");     |         $("form").removeData("unobtrusiveValidation");  |             $.validator.unobtrusive.parse("#form1");   Which should remove the validator and then re-add it.    When I submit the form however, i've stepped thru the jquery
[01:18:40] <tudda|awy> validate library and this portion of code gets called once for EACH click of my button :                                this.submit(function (event) {
[01:19:37] <tudda|awy> What it seems like,is when i call validator parse, it's adding an event to the form and it's not being removed/reset each time
[01:22:06] <tudda|awy> I guess what i don't understand is, how to look at the events inside of the debugger to figure out how its being wired up multiple times
[01:22:37] <xdjuj__> firebug > console.log() ?
[01:22:48] <xande17> iWrtCode: Sorry man, I thought someone would be able to help you here. My first guess is that if it is working on jsbin, but not on your localhost, then something on your localhost is different. Maybe the jquery versions, or the selector, maybe there's other Jquery messing around with your stuff. I would start from scratch and do just what you did on jsfiddle locally, just to make sure that it's working.
[01:22:48] <xande17>  Then add the other stuff and see if you can figure out what the problem is.
[01:22:52] <tudda|awy> Im not sure what to log..
[01:23:24] <xdjuj__> tudda|awy instead of removeData use addClass removeClass
[01:23:29] <xdjuj__> So it's easy to track
[01:23:39] <xdjuj__> (maybe)
[01:27:39] <iWrtCode> xande17: It is working on my localhost separately. When i integrate with other code, it is not working. I am using same lib.When you move image, a style is getting added to image tag, problem lies there.
[01:28:18] <ali4ever4> I am using selectToUISlider extention of jquery ui slider to convert a select box to slider , the issue is i am using it with asp.NET and i have to initalize these in pageLoad(sender, args) which is asp.NET ajax function called on each page post back (full or partial)
[01:28:35] <ali4ever4>  $("#<%=ddlCpu.ClientID%>").selectToUISlider({ sliderOptions: { change: function () { $("#cpuVal").text($('#<%=ddlCpu.ClientID%> option:selected').text()); } } }).hide();
[01:28:40] <ali4ever4> gives the following error
[01:28:54] <ali4ever4> Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on slider prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'values'
[01:29:16] <iWrtCode> xande17: Why is dragable omitting containment values ?
[01:29:42] <xande17> iWrtCode: Then the problem lies with the other code. You'll have to find where in the code that style is being added. What do you mean by omitting containment values?
[01:31:17] <iWrtCode> xande17: .draggable({     containment: [0,-130, 0, 0] }); I think, draggable will take -130 and make sure image will move till -130 but in my case image goes ot top o browser.
[01:33:43] <xande17> It could be that other style that you said is being added to the image, it could overriding the draggable functionality. If you inspect element, find out which style is taking the image to the top, and disable it. Then see if the draggable functionality starts working as expected. If the other code is breaking stuff, then changing the logic in draggable won't fix it. You have to find the code that's brea
[01:33:43] <xande17> king it and remove it.
[01:34:15] <tudda|awy> The jquery validation library has this in it : this.submit(function (event) { and it's being called everytime i click my button  .. This code is adding an event handler to the submit call, isn't it ?
[01:34:44] <tudda|awy> if so, it seems like my reset validation code, needs to also remove that event handler. before calling the validation parser
[01:38:39] <tudda|awy> Looks like that did it
[01:38:56] <tudda|awy> Now it's running WAY less code, so maybe itll be able to handle these 30 entries well enogh now
[01:43:20] <Qdest> http://jsfiddle.net/2b3GK/4/ <-- could someone take a quick look and help me figure out how I could animate the items in the list to the right? Not entirely sure how I'd go from there!
[02:03:59] <Andrew_R> this is not compatible with IE: http://jsfiddle.net/N7At4/
[02:04:17] <Andrew_R> how can I sort elements in a jquery object?
[02:04:49] <Cork> jquery always keeps element in the order they are in the dom
[02:06:10] <Andrew_R> but this works in FF
[02:06:26] <Cork> well sort returns a an array
[02:06:37] <Cork> and it exist in newer js implementations
[02:06:49] <Cork> sort != jquery
[02:07:33] <Andrew_R> I know sort isn't jquery, but I'm trying to sort the elements returned by a jquery selecotr
[02:07:37] <Andrew_R> selector
[02:08:23] <Cork> no it sorts the array like object returned by jquery
[02:08:30] <Cork> and arrays don't have sort in ie
[02:09:33] <Cork> correction some versions of ie
[02:09:41] <Cork> i don't remember when they introduced it
[02:10:08] <nesoi> does anyone here use jqm?
[02:13:28] <Cork> Andrew_R: this works for me in ie8 at least http://fiddle.jshell.net/N7At4/2/show/
[02:14:05] <Cork> (and... apparently my ie7 machine has derided to upgrade to ie8...)
[02:17:17] <seutje> I use those VMs from MS and lock them
[02:17:26] <seutje> can't even update flash :D
[02:17:34] <Andrew_R> cork: unfortunately it doesn't work in IE9
[02:17:42] <Cork> ie9?!?
[02:17:45] * Cork tests
[02:19:54] <Andrew_R> I hadn't tried it in IE8 before, but my original code works there
[02:20:01] <Andrew_R> IE9 is the odd one this time... :(
[02:20:12] <fabioportieri> a little ot: it's just me or lately firefox is terribly slow and often freeze when swtiching tabs?
[02:20:34] <Cork> ie9 should be fairly easy to fix
[02:21:21] <Andrew_R> fabioportieri: I had a problem with FF crashing all the time, but ever since version 19 I don't think I've had any crashes.
[02:21:27] <monxas> my firefox freezes when switching tabs too
[02:21:55] <monxas> and crashes, maybe twice a week
[02:23:47] <Andrew_R> Cork: I think your version does exactly the same as mine. $items is a jQuery object, but jQuery objects are "array-like" so that's why you can call the array methods on them.
[02:24:19] <Cork> well no jquery imports the arrays prototype
[02:24:25] <Cork> and that's why you can
[02:25:05] <gnarf> Cork: wrong
[02:25:24] <Cork> gnarf: so it just imports selected functions?
[02:25:28] <iWrtCode> http://jsfiddle.net/roXon/hMmbK/2/ How is style tag getting added, When I move the image
[02:25:29] <gnarf> "array-like" just means has .length and numeric properties
[02:25:44] <gnarf> Cork: yeah, slice is like the only array func thats on the jquery proto
[02:25:58] <gnarf> even then, it's not the real slice
[02:25:59] <Cork> gnarf: so jquery does implement sort?
[02:26:49] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L258-L259
[02:26:54] <gnarf> sort and splice
[02:26:55] <gnarf> only two
[02:27:01] <Cork> hmm
[02:27:08] <gnarf> oh
[02:27:08] <gnarf> push
[02:27:10] <gnarf> sorry
[02:27:10] <Cork> i really don't understand sort in ie9
[02:27:25] <Cork> i tried sorting an array of values, and it fails with that too...
[02:27:30] <Cork> weird
[02:27:46] <Cork> opps s/values/nubmers/
[02:28:39] <gnarf> so
[02:28:43] <gnarf> that sort function is wrong
[02:28:49] <gnarf> needs to return +1 -1 or 0
[02:28:57] <Cork> gah...
[02:29:06] <Cork> ya, totally forgot that
[02:29:58] <gnarf> http://fiddle.jshell.net/N7At4/3/
[02:30:11] <gnarf> Andrew_R: ^
[02:30:34] <gnarf> or skip that array call
[02:30:34] <gnarf> http://fiddle.jshell.net/N7At4/4/
[02:30:38] <gnarf> and just use $.fn.sort
[02:30:49] <fabioportieri> monxas: you solve it if you disable plugin? not me..
[02:31:04] <Cork> gnarf: the array call was me
[02:31:22] <Cork> as far as i remembered it wasn't part of jquery
[02:31:40] <gnarf> `api sort
[02:31:40] <b-ot> gnarf: No matches.
[02:31:45] <gnarf> :)
[02:31:48] <gnarf> undoced
[02:31:54] <gnarf> so maybe [].sort.call is better
[02:31:55] <Cork> and ya, its not documented
[02:31:56] * gnarf shrugs
[02:32:47] <gnarf> either way, ie9 sort is a little different algorithm
[02:33:11] <gnarf> the only reason it's in order on the rest is because of the initial order + some luck
[02:33:28] <Cork> :)
[02:33:31] <Andrew_R> IE9 must be doing a === compare internally then to see if the result is 1, 0 or -1
[02:33:35] <gnarf> no
[02:33:37] <Andrew_R> possibly?
[02:33:40] <gnarf> its just pos/neg/equal
[02:33:45] <gnarf> thats all that matters
[02:33:54] <gnarf> but the order it starts its sort
[02:33:58] <gnarf> is different
[02:34:06] <Andrew_R> FF and IE8 both work with true or false though (even though that is incorrect)
[02:34:17] <gnarf> "true" is 1
[02:34:20] <gnarf> and "false" is 0
[02:34:37] <gnarf> so true is "greater", and false else is "equal"
[02:34:39] <gnarf> in a sort method
[02:35:22] <gnarf> now, since ie9 does its sort with a different method, it finds more "equal" where they should be "less than"
[02:35:25] <gnarf> so things don't move
[02:35:31] <gnarf> and it doesn't come out sorted
[02:35:45] <gnarf> `js> print(+true);
[02:35:48] <b-ot> gnarf: 1
[02:35:50] <Andrew_R> I see
[02:35:50] <gnarf> `js> print(+false);
[02:35:53] <b-ot> gnarf: 0
[02:36:32] <gnarf> `js> print(true>0);
[02:36:34] <b-ot> gnarf: true
[02:36:43] <gnarf> `js> print(false==0);
[02:36:46] <b-ot> gnarf: true
[02:37:07] <Andrew_R> in the code, $().sort is commented "for internal use only"
[02:37:25] <gnarf> so use [].sort.call( $items, sortFn ) then
[02:37:29] <gnarf> just to be safe
[02:37:45] <Cork> Array.sort is prob a better option
[02:37:50] <Andrew_R> http://jsfiddle.net/N7At4/5/
[02:37:56] <Cork> that way you don't have to create a new array every time
[02:38:07] <gnarf> localeCompare works too
[02:38:30] <fabioportieri> i bet ie doesn't have array.sort ?
[02:38:46] <Cork> fabioportieri: ie6+ does
[02:38:58] <Cork> i checked it up a little while back when this started :)
[02:39:11] <gnarf> Array.prototype.sort
[02:39:19] <fabioportieri> ahh good to know
[02:39:24] <gnarf> [].sort is like ES2
[02:39:28] <gnarf> `mdn sort
[02:39:28] <b-ot> gnarf: Array.sort - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Center → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[02:39:37] <gnarf> nope
[02:39:39] <gnarf> ES1 even
[02:39:44] <gnarf> its everywhere
[02:39:45] <Andrew_R> I added the .toArray() so it converts the jquery object to a regular array of dom objects
[02:40:04] <gnarf> `.get
[02:40:08] <gnarf> `api .get
[02:40:08] <b-ot> gnarf: No matches.
[02:40:10] <gnarf> `api get
[02:40:13] <gnarf> bah
[02:40:13] <b-ot> gnarf: .get(): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[02:40:13] <Cork> theres a to array? thought it was makeArray
[02:40:16] <gnarf> ^^^
[02:40:26] <gnarf> .get() converts to real array
[02:40:34] * Cork nods
[02:40:42] <Andrew_R> $().toArray is correct, there is also a $.makeArray()
[02:40:56] <Cork> ?.toArray
[02:40:57] <bot-t> .toArray(): Retrieve all the DOM elements contained in the jQuery set, as an array. http://api.jquery.com/toArray/
[02:40:58] <iWrtCode> Why is draggable not smooth here http://jsfiddle.net/hMmbK/278/ If I click it goes to top or bottom.
[02:41:03] <Cork> damn... didn't know that
[02:41:08] <Andrew_R> what's the difference between $().get() and $().toArray()?
[02:41:19] <Cork> don't think there is any
[02:41:52] <Cork> Andrew_R: except that .get() can take a specific index
[02:43:57] <Andrew_R> correct, get: function( num ) { return num == null ? this.toArray() : // other code for if you passed in an index }
[02:46:43] <gnarf> also, less chars to type
[02:46:44] <gnarf> :)
[02:47:08] <Cork> but you get a deeper stack so ...
[02:47:21] <gnarf> so what?
[02:47:30] <gnarf> that one function call is not your slowness
[02:47:35] <Cork> i would prob pick toArray for that
[02:47:37] <gnarf> stop optimizing it
[02:47:48] <gnarf> `api toArray
[02:47:48] <b-ot> gnarf: .toArray(): Retrieve all the DOM elements contained in the jQuery set, as an array. http://api.jquery.com/toArray/
[02:47:57] <gnarf> 1.4+
[02:47:58] <gnarf> i suppose
[02:48:02] <thoma> who
[02:48:12] <gnarf> i still use .get()
[02:48:25] <Cork> i never use it i use [] instead
[02:48:34] <Cork> never seen the point of .get
[02:48:56] <gnarf> for index retreival, .get(1) is silly
[02:48:59] <gnarf> use [1]
[02:49:02] <gnarf> but for make array
[02:49:04] <gnarf> .get()
[02:49:09] <dgrubelic> it had to be implemented as a helper method :)
[02:49:13] <gnarf> or [].concat($something)
[02:49:24] <Andrew_R> $(selector).get(-2) // gets the second from the end
[02:49:24] <gnarf> but like whatever
[02:49:26] <gnarf> style
[02:49:32] <gnarf> yeah, negative index is useful
[02:49:40] <gnarf> can't do that with bracket notation
[02:50:06] <gnarf> but whatevs
[02:50:17] <gnarf> that's such a tiny thing
[02:50:35] <gnarf> six of one, half-dozen of the other
[02:50:52] <gnarf> personal pref, something.get(), something[0], etc
[02:50:53] <Cork> :)
[02:51:10] <gnarf> .toArray() is just so much more typing ;)
[02:51:43] <Andrew_R> I could see .toArray() == .get() (with no index) being confusing to some of the people I work with who have limited to minimal jq experience
[02:52:00] <Andrew_R> "I thought get() returned a dom element"
[02:52:23] <Andrew_R> toArray, you know what you're getting
[02:54:46] <amirite> hey all
[02:55:35] <amirite> need a good date picker & time picker extension. if range handling is built in, all the better. anyone got a tip?
[02:57:16] <Cork> amirite: i think there should be a few jquery ui datepicker plugins around that should fix that
[02:57:22] <Cork> last i checked at least
[02:57:52] <Andrew_R> amirite: jqueryui has a datePicker widget built in
[02:58:09] <Cork> Andrew_R: but the range and time isn't
[02:58:16] <Andrew_R> we're using this to add time fields to the datePicker http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[03:02:20] <Andrew_R> we had to build our own "dateRangePicker" because of some requirements on how the dates get populated and how it has to look
[03:02:35] <amirite> thanks for the link andrew
[03:04:50] <gnarf> Andrew_R: should open in up?
[03:04:57] <gnarf> Andrew_R: put it up on plugins ;)
[03:05:42] <Andrew_R> amirite: here's another link, this page has links to several different range pickers including some that highlight right on the calendar
[03:06:33] <ujjain> How do I use xmlhttp.responseText in a notificartion popup? because I don't think xmlhttp.responseText exists when I try to run the notification function
[03:07:15] <Andrew_R> gnarf: it's not really a plugin though, it's an ASP.NET MVC partial view with a combobox and 2 datepickers, and some supporting code to update the fields if the combobox is changed
[03:07:21] <Cork> ujjain: should work if you call it in the success callback
[03:07:36] * gnarf shrugs
[03:07:47] <gnarf> there needs to be a good one as a plugin
[03:07:48] <gnarf> :)
[03:08:09] <Andrew_R> (plus a bunch of other crap related to models and ids... not generic enough for me, but I didn't write much of it)
[03:08:41] <gnarf> though it's conceivable that the new version of datepicker might make it easier
[03:09:15] <gnarf> gotta run
[03:11:03] <ujjain> http://pastebin.visilang.com/view/raw/c583d832 - where should I place the notify then?
[03:12:39] <Andrew_R> ujjain: why aren't you using $.ajax()?
[03:13:36] <ujjain> Andrew_R, I'll rewrite it to .ajax, better yeah
[03:14:21] <Cork> ujjain: but to answer you're suestion
[03:14:54] <Cork> ujjain: move the $.pnotify into the onreadystatechange function
[03:15:00] <Cork> and you should be set
[03:15:34] <Cork> (that is; line 30)
[03:18:14] <iWrtCode> <Cork>:Why is draggable not smooth here http://jsfiddle.net/hMmbK/278/ If I click it goes to top or bottom.
[03:19:38] <ujjain> Cork, ahhh, I already rewrote it,
[03:19:57] <ujjain> but yeah, I see the function now, I think I tried that though.
[03:20:00] <Cork> ujjain: that is a good thing to do anyway
[03:20:05] <ujjain> http://pastebin.visilang.com/view/295ff651 - I think I made a mistake in Jquery
[03:20:59] <Cork> looks correct to me
[03:21:08] <Andrew_R> iWrtCode: I don't think "containment" works the way you are trying to use it. Containment requires a container that is larger than the element that is draggable.
[03:21:12] <Cork> (except for the railing comma)
[03:21:52] <Cork> actually i don't think draggable is meant to be used like that at all
[03:22:04] <Cork> but it might be possible, donno
[03:22:08] <iWrtCode> Andrew_R thanks for answering to my question.How can I implement draggable with ou using container ?
[03:23:04] <Andrew_R> iWrtCode: haha I knew you were going to ask that... and... I don't know.
[03:23:25] <iWrtCode> Andrew_R but I think the image is bigger than div
[03:23:55] <Andrew_R> yes that's the problem, the container has to be larger than the draggable element
[03:25:05] <iWrtCode> Andrew_R See here http://jsfiddle.net/roXon/hMmbK/2/. Same image works fine ehre
[03:26:11] <Andrew_R> ok, I didn't know that it was possible
[03:26:25] <Andrew_R> but it looks like you already have a way to do it, what is your question?
[03:26:37] <iWrtCode> Any oue out here, Help me with .draggable ??
[03:27:52] <iWrtCode> Andrew_R But when I use it in my localhost, it is taking top as -629
[03:28:50] <iWrtCode> Andrew_R When you click on div and try to move image, .draggable is placing a style so I have to unser stand, How is that calculating ?
[03:28:59] <Andrew_R> containment: [-99, -119, 0, 0] would have to be specific to the size of the image and the size of the div
[03:29:02] <fc-rk> http://pastie.org/7628537 I'm trying to send a simple jsonp POST request. First I was using .post, but I switched to .ajax when I noticed it was sending it as a GET request. Now, when I specificly set type to POST, it still continues to send it with GET. Any one seen this behaviour before? When I remove dataType: 'jsonp', it behaves like normal (send it as POST).
[03:31:26] <Andrew_R> iWrtCode: the top and left values are set when you drag it
[03:33:07] <iWrtCode> Andrew_R it has to take values from containment that is why we have containment
[03:35:04] <shrdlu-> I have an 'add to cart' button which brings up an 'your item has been added' overlay when pressed, but I want to reload the page after having clicked it - but that stops the item from being added an the overlay
[03:35:14] <shrdlu-> and now I don't know what to do :/
[03:36:58] <mladen> can you post test-case on jsfiddle or some similar service?
[03:37:17] <shrdlu-> http://www.planetside.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Untitled-2.html
[03:37:41] <shrdlu-> it's a pretty short bit of code.  I've commented the button part at the bottom
[03:38:01] <ujjain> .ajax is a post or a get?
[03:39:01] <shrdlu-> it does load this external script though - http://app.ecwid.com/script.js?1529097
[03:39:19] <shrdlu-> which I can't change
[03:39:26] <Onkeltem> Hi
[03:39:41] <Onkeltem> I can't find any documentation on jQuery.widget(). Ideas?
[03:40:51] <ujjain>         $.ajax({url:"/ujjain/updatehost.php", { var1: str }, success:function(result){
[03:40:51] <ujjain>  <  I am posting var1 the wrong way?
[03:43:46] <ujjain>         $.get("/ujjain/updatehost.php", { name: "John" }, success:function(result){
[03:43:46] <ujjain>  ?
[03:49:22] <amirite> Andrew_R: where's the other link? you forgot to paste it
[03:49:32] <amirite> or i didn't see it as i scrolled through history
[03:51:12] <mazzachre> I am trying to get this plugin to work, but I have a problem I can't quite figure out... http://jsfiddle.net/msMJN/21/ When scrolling the container all the way to the right and resizing the middle element, I can't expand it, only make it smaller... What is going on?!
[03:53:44] <mazzachre> Apparently this is also a problem when using the original "grid" plugin... And as it seems it is a problem with resize, since the data it gives me for that.size is wrong...
[04:04:40] <ujjain> $.get("/ujjain/updatehost.php", { hostname: str }, function(message){ < message is the name of the variable containing the resulting data?
[04:04:55] <Cork> yes
[04:07:21] <ujjain> http://pastebin.visilang.com/view/raw/2dcafebc - message.getElementById is not a function
[04:07:59] <sacho> noone said the resulting data is a dom element
[04:08:41] <Cork> ujjain: message is html, not dom
[04:09:07] <Cork> (unless your php script says it's ex xml or json that is)
[04:09:41] <Cork> ujjain: ah, the result down there is what the php script returns?
[04:09:58] <ujjain> Cork: yes.
[04:10:15] <Cork> ujjain: if so are you setting the response header to application/json ?
[04:10:39] <ujjain> hehe no, sorry
[04:10:42] <Cork> header('Content-Type: application/json');
[04:11:05] <Cork> if you do that you can do message.title; message.text; and message.type
[04:11:18] <Cork> or actually, $.pnotify(message) :)
[04:12:25] <ujjain> i'll also start using json_encode
[04:12:27] <ujjain> and use a array
[04:12:37] <Cork> ya
[04:15:32] <ujjain> thanks Cork, works perfectly
[04:36:22] <vanseverk> Hi guys, is there a nice way to turn a selectionbox in an autocompleting field using jquery?

[04:37:14] <vanseverk> Thanks Cork :)
[04:39:59] <futzhu> hello would you provide link with using jquery and php on channel information please. thank you
[04:41:45] <Cork> futzhu: what do you mean with channel information?
[04:42:21] <ujjain> http://pastebin.visilang.com/view/raw/f7b395d0 - How can I make an onclick executable multiple times? It doesn'tw ork a 2nd time
[04:43:03] <futzhu> Cork: i mean the text message when we join channel. channel topic :D
[04:43:44] <Cork> 1. don't use event attributes, use event listeners; 2. there isn't a limit to click, try adding an alert directly in the updateHost function
[04:43:57] <Cork> futzhu: php is actually offtopic for this channel
[04:45:06] <futzhu> sorry i just facing problem when using jquery when i want submit or get data to php files because try.jquery.com not teach that. would you guide some of newbie here to the proper tutorial about it on channel topic will be help us. thanks :D
[04:45:23] <pachet> why not just google it
[04:45:37] <pachet> the channel topic is busy doing other stuff
[04:45:50] <Cork> futzhu: you use either a normal form or ajax and then the server gets it in $_POST or $_GET
[04:46:13] <Cork> futzhu: the server code is basic php, if you need help with that part its ##php
[04:46:29] <Cork> if you need help with how to send it to the server; that is on topic for this channel
[04:47:25] <futzhu> pachet: i just got long code jquery when gogole it. yeah u know every question answer with "why not just google it?" but it will help if you give us the nice link tutorial like you do with try.jquery.com :D
[04:47:58] <futzhu> Cork: thanks i was join ##php i just need to know jquery to send it to the php files

[04:51:41] <futzhu> Cork: not a upload. pull data from database when the data record is 10k i need to show progreess bar to show to the user interaction with jquery
[04:52:57] <vanseverk> Cork: Seems like you have to throw in some extra code for it though
[04:55:05] <Gorkyman_HQ> hey guys... anyone knows how to use jquery ui toolbar in a way that they won't hide if mouse if over them once they've shown ?
[04:59:11] <batt> Hi!
[05:00:55] <TheGallery> Hey
[05:03:56] <batt> Can I ask a question about some jquery stuff? I have this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/7U4YR/ where I want to get the alert when I am draggin (and thus dropping) the image somewhere... but I don't get the alert message to display :s
[05:04:15] <batt> Only when I reclick on something it gives me the display
[05:05:16] <Cork> batt: binding events in an event listener is generally a really bad idea
[05:05:31] <seutje> whoa
[05:06:17] <seutje> so on mouseenter, we bind a mousedown, which unbinds the mousedown and binds a mouseup which unbinds the mouseup
[05:06:28] <batt> Cork: What is my best workaround then? (My fiddle was a little wrong: http://jsfiddle.net/7U4YR/1/ has the right (I did the 'mouseup' on my object, whilst it had to be on document as I thought that was right)
[05:06:44] <Cork> batt: from what you talked about use draggable
[05:06:48] <Cork> ?draggable
[05:06:49] <bot-t> Cork, UI/API/1.8/Draggable - jQuery Wiki - The jQuery UI Draggable plugin makes selected elements draggable by mouse. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/API/1.8/Draggable
[05:07:01] <Cork> batt: or use the browsers native drag and drop
[05:07:29] <batt> Cork: But the native drag and drop, isn't that only HTML5?
[05:07:48] <Cork> its only supported in fairly modern browser yes
[05:07:54] <Cork> draggable isn't
[05:08:06] <Cork> so pick one depending on your needs
[05:08:36] <batt> Cork: But in fact I only need to know the x and y position when doing the mouseup
[05:09:01] <Cork> batt: then you would have to bind it on a wider target
[05:09:18] <Cork> something like $(document).on('mouseup', function() {});
[05:09:45] <Cork> and don't add and remove them all the time, use a static event handler
[05:10:21] <talin> hello. i am using datepicker to save a date in a form. now i need to save date+time
[05:10:26] <batt> Cork: a static event handler? like just do $('myimg').mouseout?
[05:10:33] <talin> is there something similar to datepicker that lets you select time as well?
[05:10:51] <batt> $('.myimg')*
[05:12:40] <ni291187> test
[05:12:45] <daanavitch> I'm looking for a plugin like isotope that lets you filter a list of items, but more lightweight and up-to-date
[05:12:52] <daanavitch> any suggestions?
[05:12:54] <TheGallery> There is definitely something that adds time too talin. I am sure I've used a plugin before but I don't remember a name
[05:13:34] <talin> TheGallery: i found this http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[05:13:59] <TheGallery> daanavitch I happened to find something like that yesterday. Let me get a link
[05:14:03] <batt> talin: http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/ maybe that will help?
[05:14:11] <talin> batt: thank you
[05:14:22] <batt> talin: Ow sorry, seems you found it already :)
[05:15:28] <TheGallery> daanavitch try listjs.com
[05:16:31] <daanavitch> TheGallery: thanks!
[05:16:47] <TheGallery> np :)
[05:17:12] <Cork> batt: i meant bind the event listener, and in the eventlistener handle if it should act
[05:17:30] <Cork> batt: instead of binding and adding them over and over again
[05:17:38] <Cork> uh...
[05:17:43] <Cork> *binding and unbinding
[05:18:12] <batt> Cork: And if I'm not hovering it, it won't execute the mousedown event then?
[05:18:34] <Cork> batt: just let bubbling handle that
[05:18:38] <Gorkyman_HQ> hey guys... anyone knows how to use jquery ui toolbar in a way that they won't hide if mouse if over them once they've shown ?
[05:19:01] <batt> Cork: In fact what I am doing is stupid... because you have to hover it if you want to have the event mousedown been executed...
[05:19:17] <Cork> ya
[05:24:41] <batt> Cork: I will try to adapt it to what you are saying, hopefully it works, thanx in any way!
[05:25:01] <Cork> goiod luck
[05:25:05] <Cork> *good
[05:25:54] <theresajayne_> i need help stopping an accordian from opening on clicking a button on the page.
[05:26:07] <theresajayne_> tried the stopPropogation but that hasnt worked?
[05:26:33] <Cork> how is the button and the opening of the accordian related?
[05:26:44] <theresajayne_> the button is in the header
[05:27:05] <theresajayne_> on the textarea we have a evt.stopPropogation() that workd
[05:27:14] <theresajayne_> but the input is not behaving
[05:27:21] <Cork> stopPropagation should work
[05:27:28] <theresajayne_> on the checkboxes they work as well
[05:27:29] <Cork> can't see why it wouldn't
[05:27:37] <Cork> you have a testcase?
[05:27:39] <Cork> ?p
[05:27:40] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:28:10] <theresajayne_> is there a way to see which element is being selected - as I wonder if the input is being masked by something else
[05:29:00] <Cork> therealklanni: console.log($(selector)[0])
[05:32:11] <dersand> If i add an a-tag within php using ajax and then $("a").click method, nothing will work when i click it.
[05:34:28] <daanavitch> is it possible to use isotope without the layout plugin?
[05:34:33] <Cork> dersand: javascript/jquery doesn't care about php
[05:34:34] <daanavitch> I only want the filtering functionality
[05:34:53] <Cork> dersand: all it cares about is when the html gets parsed to dom
[05:35:25] <Cork> dersand: but if you want to bind click on a link tag the link tag has to be in the dom first; unless you use delegation
[05:35:47] <dersand> What is dom really?
[05:36:02] <Cork> ?g mdn dom
[05:36:03] <b-ot> Cork: Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - Mozilla Developer Center → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM
[05:36:03] <bot-t> Cork, Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM
[05:36:24] <Cork> dersand: it's what the browser uses to generate the visible page
[05:36:43] <Cork> dersand: its the whats generated from the html
[05:36:52] <dersand> But in my case the php has rendered and been shown
[05:37:27] <Cork> dersand: php generates html > html is sent over the net > the browser parses the html > dom is generated
[05:37:43] <Cork> if you send it through ajax there is a little difference in the steps
[05:38:20] <Cork> in that you get generates html > js gets html > js injects the html in the dom > dom parses the html to dom
[05:38:51] <dersand> So you are saying that i can't do a shyt with returned php?
[05:39:12] <Cork> browsers don't know what php is
[05:39:20] <Cork> php is a server language
[05:40:05] <bluesm> Is there an way to make "click" event bind to particular context ?
[05:40:18] <Cork> ?.trigger
[05:40:18] <bot-t> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[05:40:30] <dersand> But i have echo'd my stuff... Doesn't that make it "dom"?
[05:40:33] <Cork> bluesm: you can't fake some click events though
[05:40:44] <Cork> dersand: that makes it html
[05:40:55] <Cork> if you make it valid that is
[05:41:22] <Cork> on the other end that html has to be parsed, so like i said; php have nothing to do with it
[05:41:25] <abhas_> whats the difference between $("ul li")[0] and $("ul li").eq(0) ? Are they equivalent?
[05:41:49] <Cork> abhas_: $($("ul li")[0]) is basically the same as $("ul li").eq(0)
[05:42:02] <garann> am i missing something, or is there no way to trigger a custom event from a dom event without needing a nested function?
[05:42:06] <Cork> [] returns the pure dom element, while .eq() returns the dom element wrapped in jquery
[05:43:34] <vanseverk> Cork: Any idea how to make the autocomplete happen in the textfield itself?
[05:43:43] <vanseverk> using the combobox options
[05:43:59] <Cork> you mean an inline fill kind of thing?
[05:44:04] <vanseverk> Exactly :)
[05:44:14] <Cork> don't think its part of the autocomplete
[05:44:31] <Cork> but don't know haven't looked for it
[05:45:01] <Cork> vanseverk: try http://pburke.de/jquery-inlinecomplete-inline-auto-complete-for-text-input/
[05:46:01] <dersand> Is there a way to make it a DOM?
[05:46:20] <Cork> dersand: you need to explain more how it shows up in the browser
[05:46:36] <Cork> all you said is that you use jquery click event handler and php on the backend
[05:46:42] <Cork> its way to little information
[05:46:51] <dersand> Should i use pastebin?
[05:47:16] <Cork> dersand: 1. are you using ajax or is this a full page rendering?
[05:47:32] <dersand> its a search instant thing
[05:47:35] <dersand> so no?
[05:47:35] <dersand> or
[05:47:50] <screamingbanshee> what?
[05:48:10] <Cork> dersand: i think you might need to start at the basics on how the web works
[05:48:38] <screamingbanshee> dersand pm
[05:48:47] <dersand> in 10 minutes
[05:49:07] <screamingbanshee> ?
[05:53:47] <vanseverk> thanks Cork, I'll take a look
[05:54:08] <Cork> vanseverk: just did a quick google, so don't know much about it
[05:55:23] <abhas_> ?.json
[05:56:12] <Cork> abhas_: bot-t is dead so that trigger doesn't work
[05:58:11] <abhas_> cork: you know i was thinking why it failed.. can you tell the link for jquery related doc?
[05:58:19] <reloadz> hi! can you help me find some page where is described how to change page link without refreshing page using jquery? And by changeing link i ment "www.lll.com/about-us" not "www.lll.com/#about-us"
[05:58:27] <abhas_> i meant json
[05:58:27] <Cork> abhas_: api.jquery.com
[05:58:36] <reloadz> my co workes say it is possible, but i cant find any info on that
[05:58:48] <reloadz> workers*
[05:58:55] <Cork> abhas_: but what is the question about json?
[05:58:58] <abhas_> i.e. json part of the jquery doc

[05:59:44] <b-ot> Cork: History.js - GitHub Pages → http://balupton.github.io/history.js/demo/
[05:59:51] <abhas_> i wanted to learn json handling with jquery..
[05:59:55] <reloadz> Cork: ?
[06:00:08] <Cork> abhas_: json is mainly just a transfer format
[06:00:23] <Cork> abhas_: in the page you basically just have normal javascript objects
[06:00:42] <Cork> reloadz: that is how you change the url, for replacing the content, thats ajax
[06:00:54] <Cork> reloadz: if you want to load things from third party domains you can't
[06:01:48] <reloadz> content must change using ajax, that is rue
[06:02:36] <abhas_> cork: thanks, i know about the basic json stuff and xml like its format... i need to create json from a parsed xml.. so, i need the help docs for creating and reading json and xml respectively
[06:03:15] <reloadz> Cork: u have any info/page on my topic? :D
[06:03:16] <Cork> abhas_: JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify()
[06:03:23] <Cork> reloadz: i just linked to it
[06:03:31] <Cork> and sure
[06:03:40] <Cork> `api ajax
[06:03:40] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[06:03:44] <Cork> `api .ajax
[06:03:45] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[06:03:48] <Cork> `api.ajax
[06:03:54] * Cork kicks b-ot
[06:04:15] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[06:04:22] <abhas_> haha.. bot kicked :P
[06:05:11] <reloadz> yes, but i need tho change url without refreshing page - that part i don't know how to make
[06:05:12] <abhas_> cork: are those jquery functions or js functions?
[06:05:35] <Cork> abhas_: those are native in all modern browsers, you need to load it as a lib for ie<9
[06:05:41] <Cork> ?g json2.js
[06:05:41] <b-ot> Cork: douglascrockford/JSON-js · GitHub → https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js
[06:05:41] <abhas_> cork: also i need similar things for xml parsing
[06:05:51] <Cork> abhas_: just use the normal dom
[06:06:00] <Cork> $(xml).find()
[06:07:39] <abhas_> cork: i need to load the external xml first.. how to do that?
[06:07:49] <Cork> abhas_: ajax
[06:07:55] <chilversc_> reloadz: is the new url within the same origin? if so you want to look at pushstate
[06:08:17] <Cork> $.get('xml resource', function(xml){ handle });
[06:08:39] <chilversc_> reloadz: pushstate isn't jQuery, its part of the browser, not all browsers support it yet
[06:08:40] <Cork> chilversc_: that's part of the first url i gave him
[06:08:58] <Cork> with the full documentation on how it works
[06:10:03] <abhas_> cork: what should be in the handle function? i need to load a local file?
[06:10:22] <reloadz> chilversc_: for instance if I am in a page and I click on a link that belongs to the same domain. it changes link in address bar, but dosent refreshes page
[06:10:24] <Cork> abhas_: you mean local to the browser?
[06:10:36] <abhas_> yes.. from my computer
[06:10:53] <Cork> abhas_: that would be totally different
[06:11:05] <Cork> abhas_: you would habe to use the file picker then
[06:11:10] <Cork> <input type="file">
[06:11:23] <Cork> and the File api (not supported in older ie's)
[06:11:29] <Cork> ?g mdn File api

[06:11:38] <bluesm> I I have an event handler.
[06:11:56] <bluesm> How can I get the element on which this event was triggered.
[06:12:06] <Cork> bluesm: the element is this
[06:12:09] <bluesm> As well as context
[06:12:15] <Cork> if you want to work with jquery on it use $(this)
[06:12:53] <bluesm> Cork: but I do need also to call the "methods" from the object (where event was set)...
[06:13:15] <abhas_> i know the file name. is it possible to load without user interction i.e. the user doesnt have to select?
[06:13:38] <ravenzz> Cork do you test your js?
[06:15:11] <vitozev> Hello, guys! I have to create functionality that allow to interact with items inside a video (HTML5 video), it should works with MP4/OGG containers
[06:16:51] <vitozev> We'll get from a JSON file on the server the position of the object we want to follow on the video, and the user can click the item get an alert();
[06:17:03] <vitozev> Any suggestion for library?
[06:20:22] <Gorkyman_HQ> hey guys... anyone knows how to use jquery ui toolbar in a way that they won't hide if mouse if over them once they've shown ?
[06:24:06] <lawjeremy> join #html5
[06:24:38] <Cork> ravenzz: do you mean unittests?
[06:24:43] <Cork> or what?
[06:27:50] <Z3R0> Good Morning Everyone
[06:32:47] <ezio> i want to use jquery validate to do a server side validation.  when the validation is complete, i want to extract a nextra variable fromt he json and do something programmitc to the form.  is that a possibility
[06:33:25] <Z3R0> jquery to do server side validation? that just is not right?
[06:33:25] <batt> ezio: Yes!
[06:33:52] <ezio> batt, should i just put it in the success for the ajax settings? will it know to return the json to the calling remote method
[06:35:02] <batt> ezio: You put the json_encoded as an echo after doing the ajax request in the php file
[06:35:18] <batt> and on the success side you will receive the json data
[06:35:29] <Z3R0> oh was that what he was asking ?
[06:35:35] <ezio> no
[06:36:09] <ezio> Z3R0, i didn't see your message
[06:36:13] <ezio> from before
[06:36:15] <ezio> umm
[06:36:23] <batt> But you can't do server side validation with client-side tools. You can only assure that the data is valid, you can't do something with it server side
[06:36:35] <ezio> validate will go to the server and ask if it's valid then treat the form the way it would any form
[06:36:36] <Z3R0> ^
[06:36:37] <batt> jquery is in the browser
[06:36:56] <Z3R0> it's pretty standard ajax...
[06:37:02] <ezio> yeah
[06:37:04] <ezio> the problem is
[06:37:07] <ezio> with validate
[06:37:14] <Z3R0> jquery submit > php validate > return json > output response
[06:37:22] <ezio> i want to do extra stuff once i get the valid: true from the ajax
[06:37:25] <batt> lik Z3R0 sais
[06:37:29] <ezio> i'll also have an exists: true
[06:37:31] <Z3R0> oh that's easy ;)
[06:37:38] <Z3R0> I use an 'error' field
[06:37:46] <batt> Yes, than you have to do success: function(data){ your code; }
[06:37:50] <batt> in your ajax requrest
[06:37:52] <batt> request*
[06:37:58] <plesh> test
[06:38:00] <Z3R0> $ajax['error'] = true; $ajax['error_msg'] = 'Invalid Login'; return json_encode($ajax);
[06:38:08] <ezio> and that won't give validate cancer?
[06:38:13] <Z3R0> if (response.error) { do stuff; }
[06:38:25] <Z3R0> what?
[06:38:37] <Z3R0> plesh: test right back at ya
[06:38:45] <Z3R0> validate cancer?
[06:38:55] <batt> I don't know what validate cancer is tbh
[06:39:11] <plesh> Z3R0 just checking im verified, never used freenode before
[06:39:13] <plesh> :][
[06:39:16] <Z3R0> haha
[06:39:41] <Z3R0> lol
[06:40:16] <ezio> validate and cancer are two separate nouns
[06:40:28] <ezio> jquery validate won't get cancer if i do it like this
[06:40:29] <ezio> right?
[06:40:41] <Z3R0> wtf is "won't get cancer" mean ?
[06:40:59] <Z3R0> where are you getting these terms?
[06:41:26] <ezio> cancer is a disease where bad cells metastisize, getting larger and larger until it explodes through your chest and spits acid at everyone
[06:42:00] <batt> Don't you mean bugged?
[06:42:13] <ezio> lol ... k i'mma try this but if it doesn't work it's on you
[06:42:19] <Z3R0> ok... I'm done... lol I'm not an idiot, everyone fucking knows what "cancer" means in the fucking real world...
[06:42:20] <batt> In computer terms only bugs, virusses, worms can kill something :D not cancer
[06:42:43] <Z3R0> /iggy is your friend...
[06:42:43] <ezio> Z3R0, i'm just being silly
[06:42:43] <b-ot> Z3R0: memorised “iggy”.
[06:43:28] <fabioportieri> Z3R0: is like saying that something stinks, or sucks, i suppose
[06:44:00] <Z3R0> @ fabioportieri: no, I was saying he was being stupid and I'm not going to help someone who is that fucking sarcastic when he's asking for help.
[06:44:11] <Z3R0> so I simply ignored him
[06:44:58] <ezio> Z3R0, i wasn't being sarcastic ... i was really appreciative and just trying to get a chuckle
[06:45:07] <ezio> i thought you would've seen through my ruse immediately
[06:45:25] <ezio> i sowwee
[06:46:20] <fabioportieri> ehe i hate when you help someone and it goes out of the channel without even saying thanks
[06:46:45] <Guest44319> Hello everyone
[06:47:07] <fabioportieri> ezio: i'm not referring at you of course
[06:47:40] <ezio> lol :)  yeah.  that is a jerk move.
[06:48:28] <Krambiorix> hi, i have the problem that when i call my function , i don't get anything back.... http://pastebin.com/ftUwvXeB
[06:52:08] <bluesm> Could you help me
[06:52:09] <bluesm> http://jsbin.com/odalaq/9/edit
[06:52:50] <Krambiorix> nevermind my question!
[06:54:13] <bluesm> I want to call method from object when event executes
[06:56:18] <Z3R0> bluesm what are you trying to do exactly ?
[06:57:18] <jammypeach> Z3R0 he posted a link earlier, here: http://jsbin.com/odalaq/9/edit
[07:01:23] <Z3R0> bluesm: http://jsfiddle.net/bVPU7/1/ like that ?
[07:02:41] <Z3R0> guess he afk now apparently lol
[07:03:17] <sahbeewah> global variables are bad
[07:05:36] <Z3R0> yea sahbeewah, I don't really understand what he's doing exactly there, I mean, it looks like a plugin, but then there are other things happening there, that are a little out there
[07:09:06] <sahbeewah> it's called, object-oriented programming
[07:10:00] <bluesm> Z3R0: Heyyy.
[07:10:12] <Z3R0> yea... one sec, I'm taking a look again
[07:10:16] <Z3R0> see if there's a better method
[07:10:22] <bluesm> Z3R0:  You assign "me" to window.
[07:10:40] <Z3R0> yea
[07:10:44] <Z3R0> looking at it again
[07:10:58] <Z3R0> I mean it works, just not the way it should be
[07:11:27] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/bVPU7/2/ that works too...
[07:11:34] <Z3R0> if you just call the function directly
[07:11:38] <Z3R0> MyClass.prototype.setAlert();
[07:12:59] <CalvinMcGee> I have a question on stackoverflow I need help with, http://stackoverflow.com/q/16062347/894816.

[07:16:23] <Ansikt> ?
[07:16:37] <Ansikt> Is there a way to stop a link from being followed without also preventing event bubbling
[07:17:21] <abhas> cork: hi, i finally got xml loading using $.get("name.xml") and later use a.responseText to get the xml text. Now how to parse it?
[07:17:30] <Z3R0> Ansikt preventDefault() /
[07:17:33] <Z3R0> return false?
[07:17:56] <ajpiano> `api jQuery.parseXML @ abhas
[07:17:57] <b-ot> abhas: jQuery.parseXML(): Parses a string into an XML document. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[07:18:55] <Ansikt> preventDefault seems to stop the parent element from getting the event also.
[07:19:21] <Z3R0> Ansikt got code?
[07:19:32] <Ansikt> It's an a tag inside a label tag.  On click, I want the label to trigger its associated element, but not follow the link
[07:19:40] <Ansikt> I'll throw up a fiddle.  One sec.
[07:20:35] <Z3R0> brb ciggy
[07:22:05] <abhas> cork: the xml parser is treating newlines as textnode. Is there any parser setting to not do that?
[07:22:18] <abhas> or should i just manually remove them?
[07:26:15] <Ansikt> Z3R0: http://jsfiddle.net/YeMVc/
[07:28:20] <Z3R0> so what do you want exactly?
[07:28:27] <Z3R0> click the link but don't follow the link? but toggle?
[07:29:26] <Ansikt> Yeah.  We remain on the same page, but the checkbox should be toggled, and any other events bound to any other parents fire.
[07:29:40] <Bloomberg> Good morning guys!!
[07:30:01] <Ansikt> What I'm doing now is .parent().click() but this doesn't work in some cases and is kind of a hack
[07:30:37] <Bloomberg> I need to know how can I go back in a selection like this    ::    $("#left-menu li ul li a")
[07:31:45] <abhas> ajpiano:  xmlparser seems to parse newlines in .xml file as textnodes. how to stop that?
[07:33:00] <Z3R0> hmm...
[07:33:16] <ajpiano> abhas: replace all the newlines before you pass it to parseXML ?
[07:33:18] <Ansikt> Z3R0: See the third scenario here.  This is actually closer to the real markup.   So we want both children AND parents to work.
[07:33:26] <Ansikt> http://jsfiddle.net/YeMVc/1/
[07:35:38] <Z3R0> what about using .trigger('click') /
[07:35:48] <jammypeach> Bloomberg - do you mean select the parent of an element? $(selector).parent() or $(selector).parents() might be what you're looking for
[07:36:34] <Ansikt> Z3R0: .trigger('click') is the same as .click()
[07:37:40] <Krambiorix> i have a datepicker but when it opens i can't select the day before the date.  Let's say if the date is 15 may 2013 , i can't select 14 may... Anyone?
[07:37:55] <Ansikt> Z3R0:  I mean, it works in terms of fixing the label, but if the checkbox is the child of the anchor, then it breaks the checkbox
[07:37:56] <BillCriswell> jammypeach: .closest() if you only want to go to the closest parent instead of getting all parents.
[07:38:19] <Bloomberg> jammypeach: If for example I need to get  the first "li a" of this select $("#left-menu li ul li a")
[07:39:45] <Ansikt> Z3R0: http://jsfiddle.net/YeMVc/4/
[07:39:48] <Z3R0> I guess it would be easier to see the code as is, because right now, there are several different setups and I don't know which one you intend to use
[07:40:09] <Ansikt> Z3R0:  The third setup is the closest to what I'm currently using.
[07:40:38] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/YeMVc/5/ // works for all ?
[07:41:19] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: You can do #left-menu li:first-child a
[07:41:33] <Ansikt> Z3R0: Click on the checkbox.
[07:41:56] <Ansikt> That was the problem with my solution, and what eventually drove me to IRC.
[07:41:58] <abhas> ajpiano: i think the problem is with my approach.. I'm using $.parseXML($.get("a.graphml").responseText) for xml parsing.. the problem is whitespaces befor the node tag name is considered as seperate textnode. how should i do it?
[07:42:05] <Z3R0> ah right
[07:42:09] <Z3R0> because it's triggering 2x
[07:42:14] <converge> I have this span <span class="order_total"></span> and Im trying to write something inside with it $('.order_total').val('ok'); does someone knows why it's not working ?
[07:42:28] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: http://jsbin.com/ubevov/1/edit might make it a bit clearer.
[07:42:29] <Z3R0> the link wraps the element... and so both events fire
[07:43:02] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/ireken/1/edit
[07:43:04] <Bloomberg> See that plz
[07:43:08] <Z3R0> that's your problem really...
[07:44:10] <Bloomberg> I need alert the value of the first li tag with the value of selected tag
[07:45:06] <Ansikt> Z3R0: Right.  So can we stop the link event while still preserving the checkbox event?
[07:45:19] <Ansikt> Z3R0:  OH I SEE
[07:45:22] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: What's a "selected tag"?
[07:45:35] * Ansikt facepalms
[07:45:48] <anli__> lol
[07:45:57] <Gorkyman_HQ> anyone familiar with jquery ui tooltip?
[07:46:19] <Bloomberg> The HTML is a ul list with three levels
[07:46:37] <BillCriswell> Right right.
[07:46:41] <anli__> I have tried the youtube plugin for ckeditor, a button comes up and when I press it, the page will just dim out, nothing else happends
[07:47:31] <Bloomberg> So I open the first level, then open the second level, and by last I open the third level and I need that show me the value of this third selected level with the value of first level
[07:47:40] <Bloomberg> Understand me?
[07:49:49] <BillCriswell>  Bloomberg: If sounds overly complicated.
[07:50:11] <BillCriswell> Where have you seen this pattern before?
[07:50:17] <Z3R0> Ansikt tring to figure that out now
[07:50:35] <d_d_d> hi guys. is this code currect? http://jsbin.com/uxayoj/3/edit
[07:51:36] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/YeMVc/6/ this is actually working though :(
[07:51:41] <Bloomberg> I'm doing my own project, And this is a requeriment now
[07:51:48] <Z3R0> oh wait, forgot to click the checkbox
[07:51:54] <Z3R0> yea that part fails
[07:53:08] <BillCriswell> d_d_d: You have an extra }.
[07:54:26] <BillCriswell> d_d_d: I think this is what you want: http://jsbin.com/uxayoj/4/edit
[07:55:17] <xinming> Hi, for a popup, When I click on the input, My popup closes because the event goes to body, and I have a event handler to clear all popup. Then, I add the 'click' event handle for the div of the popup which does only, e.stopPropagation(); e.preventDefault();  Now, It fixed old issue, But another issue raised, which is, the form within the popup now doesn't work. What is the best way to achieve something like this please?
[07:55:21] <d_d_d> billcriswell: yes you right. but why console logging "undefined"?
[07:56:02] <xinming> What I'm asking is a better idea what is the sane way to achieve this.
[07:56:21] <BillCriswell> d_d_d: Because app.getLocation() doesn't return anything.
[07:57:41] <d_d_d> http://jsbin.com/uxayoj/7/edit still not working. $(location).attr('pathname') dose not return anything?
[07:57:48] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/ayoqah/1/edit
[07:58:14] <Bloomberg> I know perfectly before is not a function, but simply I will need some like this.
[07:58:37] <BillCriswell> d_d_d: You probably shouldn't overwrite location
[07:58:44] <Bloomberg> So, If I click on "Madrid" alert me (spain + madrid)
[07:59:12] <Z3R0> Ansikt any luck on your end ?
[07:59:26] <d_d_d> i see http://jsbin.com/uxayoj/8/edit this is working thanks billcriswell
[07:59:32] <BillCriswell> d_d_d: Welcome.
[07:59:58] <xinming> anyone here gives me any hint for my issue?
[08:00:16] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell: Have you seen my script example?
[08:00:21] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: If you can wrap Spain in a span you could do $('li').on('click', function(){ alert( $(this).closest('li').find('span').text(); });
[08:00:46] <BillCriswell> .find('span').first() might be safer.
[08:01:10] <d_d_d> BillCriswell: but i have some question.  does app.init and app.getlocation have another function scope?
[08:01:15] <Ansikt> Z3R0: Still looking

[08:11:33] <TheresaJayne> i have added some new divs for positioning, how do i reflect that
[08:15:53] <jammypeach> konomax123 yep
[08:16:08] <yekta> Hello, is there a way to do something like $('article').not('.focus-item') and fade everything but the focus-item even when the focus-item is a child or grandchild of some of the elements captured in $('article')?
[08:16:28] <jammypeach> TheresaJayne can you post a jsfiddle of your code? http://jsfiddle.net
[08:16:49] <Z3R0> nooooo
[08:16:53] <Z3R0> he just fucking left
[08:17:19] <yekta> So $('article').not('.focus-item).fadeTo(0, 0.3) will still fade the focus-item if it is a child of article.  I'd like to get around that somehow.
[08:18:50] <TheresaJayne> jammypeach its a bit hard, as i cant post real code easily,
[08:19:03] <jammypeach> yekta try selecting the article children before your .not. like this: $('article').children().not('.focus-item')...
[08:19:04] <TheresaJayne> Its more a query about selectors in JQuery
[08:19:49] <yekta> jammypeach: hmm, nope no cigar
[08:20:16] <jammypeach> TheresaJayne fair enough, have you had a look at the manual for selectors? it might answer your question - http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[08:20:17] <TheresaJayne> anyway just resolved it - i had a return false; that was stopping the keypresses working
[08:21:45] <jammypeach> yekta you could try a .find('*') instead, that would select everything that's a child or granchild of article
[08:22:06] <jammypeach> yekta like $('article').find('*').not('.focus-item')...
[08:22:28] <Nancy2012> I have a big problem managning Cookies on Jquery UI Tabs. It works fine on Chrome, Safari and Firefox but not IE.. actually, Cookie would not work at all.. it even doesnt define on IE see the code here… http://jsfiddle.net/pqfmQ/  .. thanks in advance
[08:26:06] <yekta> jammypeach: unfortunately, still didn't work
[08:26:40] <yekta> jammypeach: I think its because one of the parent elements of the .focus-item is getting faded and therefore the .focus-item, being a child is faded as well
[08:29:20] <jammypeach> yekta yes that would make sense. best thing I can suggest is that you put another class (say .fademe) on any of the elems you would want to fade, i.e the elems that could get the focus-item class. then target that class like $('.fademe').not('.focus-item')
[08:30:14] <yekta> jammypeach: cool, I'll try that.
[08:30:15] <yekta> Thanks

[08:34:45] <NoiseEee> 101 is switching protocols / websockets isnt it?
[08:35:21] <NoiseEee> switching protocols request, DoctorMonocular_
[08:35:45] <spobat__> hi
[08:36:04] <spobat__> any idea why if($.browser.msie) results in "Cannot read property 'msie' of undefined " ?
[08:36:29] <NoiseEee> spobat__: sounds like you're using a newest jquery, there is no longer $.browser in jquery
[08:36:45] <spobat__> okay, that explains it!
[08:37:01] <NoiseEee> spobat__: http://blog.jquery.com/2013/02/16/jquery-migrate-1-1-1-released/ | http://blog.jquery.com/2013/02/04/jquery-1-9-1-released/

[08:37:02] <botton> [ jQuery 1.9.1 Released | Official jQuery Blog ] - http://blog.jquery.com
[08:37:10] <spobat__> has this feature been removed completely+permanently, or is there a subsitute?
[08:37:15] <NoiseEee> removed completely
[08:37:21] <spobat__> okay
[08:37:29] <NoiseEee> don't browser sniff, feature detect
[08:38:20] <spobat> I intentionally do not want to support IE or MS in any way.
[08:39:31] <NoiseEee> lol why
[08:39:34] <NoiseEee> not even ie 10?
[08:39:35] <spobat> Furthermore, IE is highly incompatible with many js libraries/css3 styles out there. For another, it cannot even render resized pngs and gifs correctly yet (teted on ie10).
[08:39:45] <NoiseEee> spobat: you need to think again dude
[08:39:45] <spobat> Yep, the standard is out for over 17 years now.. *tss*
[08:39:47] <spobat> tested*
[08:40:06] <NoiseEee> well then you can try parsing the user agent string yourself i suppose
[08:40:16] <spobat> i got the luck my target group is educated and uses modern browsers :D
[08:40:39] <spobat> let me get out that example..
[08:40:42] <NoiseEee> anytime you find yourself closing off modern browsers, its a suspect choice
[08:40:45] <spobat> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6559846/ex_IE_crap.PNG
[08:40:47] <NoiseEee> anyways, do what you wish
[08:41:08] <spobat> a simple, browser-resized png with transparency. that's it.
[08:41:31] <spobat> the standard has been released 1994. Now we have 2013 and IE10 is not a bit better.
[08:42:31] <spobat> I hope MS disappears soon :pp. Fairly speaking, VS and c# (and according to some, even the xbox) isn't "that" bad.
[08:42:36] <NoiseEee> browser-resizing images is pretty lame anyhoe
[08:43:18] <spobat> it's actually a 512x* image resized to something of about 200x* I think.
[08:43:57] <NoiseEee> still, whats the point of that
[08:44:06] <spobat> I did this basically for two reasons: supporting state-of-the-art screen resolutions (retina) and being more flexible in the css design.
[08:44:40] <spobat> for "mobile devices" we've got an app! :D
[08:44:50] <Megido> Hi
[08:44:59] <Megido> why my scrollto dnt work?
[08:45:07] <Megido> $("paginator").scrollTo(100);
[08:45:24] <NoiseEee> did you mean $("#paginator") ?
[08:45:26] <dallen> Hi all
[08:45:29] <spobat> NoiseEee, I think your point would be "minimize page size+load time", right?

[08:46:18] <aro> anyone know how to prevent a cursor from moving when a draggable object reaches its limit
[08:47:12] <dallen> I'm using $.getJSON in a function, and within the getJSON function I'm returning a value. However, I can't seem to access that value from the "parent" function. So something like function test() { $.getJSON('test.json', function(json) { return json.text; }); }
[08:47:31] <dallen> I know it shouldn't work that way, so I tried 'return $.getJSON
[08:47:35] <dallen> But that didn't work either

[08:55:19] <DoctorMonocular_> NoiseEee hey I looked into it and I'm not switching protocols. I've also tried a fully qualified URL as well as just a relative url, but there was no change. I'm a bit stumped?
[08:55:55] <NoiseEee> DoctorMonocular_: pastebin your sample. you might not be switching protocols but the server is asking you to.
[08:56:41] <DoctorMonocular_> NoiseEee sure, what exactly do you want me to paste?
[08:57:11] <DoctorMonocular_> NoiseEee the other relevant info is that this used to work as is, but stopped sometime in the last few days, but I'm not exactly sure when
[08:57:35] <aro> tsheva: kind of
[08:59:31] <NoiseEee> DoctorMonocular_: your server didn't all of a sudden implement ssl or leave ssl?  pastebin your xhr call/code
[08:59:39] <vladikoff> botton, are you a bot?
[09:01:05] <tsheva> @aro in order words you mean whenever the mouse attempts to enter the area it cannot ? if thats the case have you ever considered setting the cursor location ?
[09:01:11] <tw2113> .
[09:01:32] <aro> no
[09:01:37] <aro> its not that
[09:01:45] <aro> have you used jsfiddle before
[09:02:37] <ajpiano> if anyone knows who is responsible for botton, please get in touch w/ me :)
[09:02:41] <aro> i want to basically prevent 'deselection' of a dragged object when the user reaches the point at which it can go no further
[09:02:46] <aro> botton?

[09:05:23] <BillCriswell> I missed what happened.
[09:05:27] <DoctorMonocular_> the error is in the .js file, as a comment
[09:05:55] <BillCriswell> Must have been good to piss off ajpiano.
[09:06:17] <ajpiano> i am not pissed
[09:06:28] <ajpiano> just the first time i noticed it and i don't know abou tit
[09:07:00] <BillCriswell> I've seen you sit through some pretty annoying people is all I was basing that off of haha.
[09:07:28] <ajpiano> people aren't bots :)
[09:07:40] <jessicard> challenge accepted
[09:07:53] <BillCriswell> I wasn't aware it was a bot. Agreed!
[09:07:57] <ajpiano> lol jessicard
[09:09:45] <NoiseEee> DoctorMonocular_: well you'll probably want to check the backend out i guess and see whats changed, but ugh why are you using async:false???
[09:10:01] <aro> ne1 know?

[09:17:24] <DoctorMonocular_> NoiseEee this is a legacy codebase, I don't know why they did that, and I don't want to change it and find out the hard way 8/
[09:17:59] <NoiseEee> DoctorMonocular_: well i think the first place it examine is the backend, since the response is what's changing.
[09:19:26] <DoctorMonocular_> NoiseEee I hear you, but I'm not sure how that's possible,. It appears that nothing is even hitting the backend , and nothing has changed there
[09:19:43] <DoctorMonocular_> on the other hand nothing has really changed on the front end either 8/
[09:19:47] <NoiseEee> of course its hitting the backend, the server is asking you to switch protocols; its giving you a 101

[09:21:19] <Ahiru> Hello
[09:21:32] <Ahiru> I have some trouble solving an issue with my code
[09:21:47] <Ahiru> my website is http://bv915club.com.br/
[09:22:19] <Ahiru> I need to make that full screen slider to be autoplay on load
[09:22:36] <aro> is there a way to prevent draggable from dragging an object any further than a certain point on the screen?
[09:23:27] <Ahiru> I added the jquery code on jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/XCuAz/
[09:24:01] <Ahiru> I discovered the line that controls the slider. it is line 316
[09:24:49] <Ahiru> if somebody can help me, I would be very grateful
[09:24:54] <Ahiru> :)
[09:27:40] <Z3R0> Ahiru what's the prob ?
[09:30:04] <Ahiru> Z3R0: I cant make my full screen slider to be autoplay on load. my website is http://bv915club.com.br/ and the jquery code is http://jsfiddle.net/XCuAz/ and the slider part is at lne 316
[09:30:08] <aro> how do i stop draggable from dragging beyond a certain point on ym page
[09:30:21] <Ahiru> I couldn't find a way to do this
[09:32:32] <nod_> hi there, I'm working with jQuery 1.9 and using .prop() to toggle the state of some <details> elements. I have a CSS rule which says: "details:not([open])" and it fails miserably to apply
[09:32:40] <nod_> when I use .attr() it does work though
[09:33:24] <nod_> it is a jQuery issue or is it just that I should be using .attr for that anyway?
[09:33:31] <BlakeRG> Could anyone tell me what are generally considered the "best" AJAX pagination plugins for jQuery?
[09:35:21] <TheresaJayne> nod what version of jquery
[09:36:00] <TheresaJayne> as .prop only came in on 1.6
[09:36:10] <nod_> TheresaJayne: 1.9
[09:36:42] <nod_> 1.9.1 actually
[09:36:47] <Z3R0> so latest stable ?
[09:36:51] <nod_> yes
[09:37:32] <TheresaJayne> cant help much - we are on 1.7
[09:37:42] <LaMakina> could you post a code snippet ?
[09:37:48] <nod_> sure, hang on
[09:38:12] <dallen> http://jsfiddle.net/donaldallen/Lew32/ <-- Any idea how I can get data from this anon function?
[09:38:39] <dallen> console.log returns the data, but the return never happens
[09:39:22] <LaMakina> from where or to where are you expecting it to return ?
[09:39:49] <Ahiru> Z3R0: actually it starts at line 264
[09:39:57] <dallen> In the script I do a getURLParameters(filename); so if the uri parameter exists, it gets returned. if it doesn't, I do a getJSON and grab the latest data
[09:40:09] <LaMakina> right, i can see that
[09:40:15] <dallen> So in getJSON, I want to return json.filename, but I know that's not possible by just doing a return json.filename
[09:40:23] <dallen> So I'm sending json.filename to another function and wanting to return it from there
[09:40:28] <dallen> Which… I guess doesn't make sense now that I think about it
[09:40:47] <LaMakina> yyeah :)
[09:41:19] <dallen> But … when I do returnValueFromJson(json.filename), the returnValue function does get the data, as the console.log works
[09:41:40] <LaMakina> you need to re-route back to your data fglow.
[09:41:43] <LaMakina> flow.
[09:42:20] <nod_> LaMakina: http://jsfiddle.net/knEgr/
[09:42:24] <LaMakina> in other words. where do you want to send that json.filename var now ?
[09:42:41] <nod_> LaMakina: need to try in Firefox or opera, I know that doesn't work in them
[09:42:42] <dallen> I want to send it back to getURLParameters, so it can return it
[09:42:59] <LaMakina> dallen: that's not gonna work
[09:43:15] <LaMakina> because
[09:43:28] <dallen> Is it because getJSON is async?
[09:43:32] <nod_> meh, looks like it's a browser thing again… works in chrome which supports the details element
[09:43:43] <dallen> It's jsonp actually so it's always async I believe...
[09:43:50] <LaMakina> your getURLParameters method is synchroineous if the uri exists but async it you need to fetch it.
[09:44:00] <LaMakina> (getJSON)
[09:44:21] <LaMakina> sso in the case that thhe URI does exist. it;'ll return that value just fine
[09:44:36] <LaMakina> but if it's a getJSON call. it'll be async and you can't return that  the same way
[09:44:51] <LaMakina> you have to handle it later in a callback, which is what you are kinda doing with returnValueFromJSON
[09:44:57] <dallen> Right
[09:45:31] <dallen> You know, now that I think about it, I'm overcomplicating this. I actually don't need the URL parameters now, since I have a json file that's always updated.
[09:45:45] <LaMakina> there you go :p
[09:45:58] <LaMakina> nod_: let me hav a look
[09:50:41] <LaMakina> nod_: yeah i can replicate on FF.
[09:51:58] <LaMakina> not knowledgeable on that one.
[09:52:09] <nod_> LaMakina: i'll just use attr, works for all of them
[09:52:17] <LaMakina> yup
[09:52:56] <nod_> LaMakina: thanks for having a look :)
[09:53:02] <LaMakina> np
[10:20:16] <Ortund> I'm still struggling with my show/hide mechanic for my code samples... http://www.loganyoung.za.net/articles/file-download-with-asp.net
[10:20:33] <Ortund> Anyone got any ideas?
[10:23:02] <jdelgado> Ortund, I would answer your question, but you really didn't ask one...
[10:23:51] <Ortund> jdelgado basically I want the C# and VB buttons by the code samples to show/hide the relevant sample based on which is clicked
[10:24:00] <Ortund> toggle() almost works right...
[10:24:12] * Ortund still hasn't actually asked a question
[10:25:54] <jdelgado> Ortund, Again, ask a question and I'll be happy to answer it... lol
[10:26:02] <Ortund> jdelgado in short, can you help me figure out how to show only the C# code samples by default and then swap them for the VB samples when the user clicks on the VB button?
[10:26:46] <jdelgado> Ortund, It's got to be a question. I'd be here all day if I started doing people's projects for them.
[10:27:15] <Ortund> jdelgado okay lets start with, why aren't the vb samples hiding on page load
[10:30:04] <jdelgado> Ortund, I can't figure out if you are trolling me, or really expect me to go through all of your code
[10:31:16] <Ortund> jdelgado not trolling, I'm just all out of ideas... don't know where to go with any of the problems here
[10:31:47] <jdelgado> ?p
[10:31:47] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/

[10:33:54] <deetcher> I'm trying to load content into an iframe from a different domain.. I'm running into the sameorigin issue and I'm wondering if there is a way to run some javascript code when that error is encountered.. so if the iframe can't load it will open a new tab for instance..
[10:33:58] <deetcher> any ideas?
[10:34:44] <jdelgado> deetcher, Does it have to be through javascript? Or can you just iframe it with html?
[10:35:03] <deetcher> jdelgado: what do you mean by iframe it with html?
[10:35:33] <jdelgado> deetcher, As in, does it have to be loaded dynamically, or can you just add <iframe> tags to html?
[10:36:27] <deetcher> I've added an iframe tag to the html.. I'm using javascript to change the src of the iframe and some of the sites the iframe could point to don't allow the cross-domain stuffs
[10:36:53] <deetcher> so I want to handle the iframe failing if i can by opening the url in another tab
[10:36:59] <blindMoe> instead of justing changing src have you tried just recreating the iframe element entirely?
[10:37:02] <DarkKnightCZ> hi, anyone has an idea, how to bind click to map area for single click in IE? (.click() gets called only on second click)
[10:37:21] <jdelgado> Ortund: Your code isn't waiting for your syntax hilighter to finish. Add an additional delay before the hide or use a callback. Solved.
[10:37:39] <deetcher> No, I have it changing url's just fine.. that part works.  I don't recreate it or anything like that.. I just want to detect if the url fails to load into the iframe
[10:38:48] <jdelgado> DarkKnightCZ: Throw your code on jsfiddle
[10:38:50] <jdelgado> ?p
[10:38:50] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:39:22] <DarkKnightCZ> yep, i will try to simplify it and paste it
[10:40:05] <jdelgado> deetcher: Throw your code on jsfiddle
[10:41:23] <Ortund> jdelgado what element do I target for the delay?
[10:41:42] <stream> Hi! what's the best way to preload all images from a html file, both inline and from the css?
[10:41:50] <davidmahoney> hey guy should I be expecting this to work
[10:41:52] <davidmahoney> http://pastebin.com/QKkCk15s
[10:42:14] <davidmahoney> I think not because I changing the content of the div inside on click
[10:42:19] * Ortund can't think straight tonight :/
[10:42:22] <davidmahoney> it is not working
[10:42:25] <jdelgado> Ortund: That is why I asked you to put it on pastebin, it is a lot easier to troubleshoot, that is all I'm giving you, you have to figure it out since you want to do it your way.
[10:43:36] <Ortund> *sigh*
[10:43:47] <crawleyprint> How do you put #upload_button on page? Is it in the dom when page loads?
[10:44:00] <davidmahoney> ya
[10:45:11] <davidmahoney> I am right in thinking that is how Jquery because I am changing the div inside the click of the same div
[10:45:24] <davidmahoney> *that is how Jquery works
[10:46:54] <Snwspeckle> Has anyone here used highcharts?
[10:47:05] <jessicard> i have
[10:48:24] <Snwspeckle> jessicard: I am trying to populate a line graph with data from my MYSQL table. The Y axis is the number of tickets sold and the x axis is the 5 most recent games. I want the table to be live so when a user buys a ticket, the chart will update and it will have a greater value
[10:48:28] <Snwspeckle> How would I go about this?
[10:48:56] <Ortund> jdelgado http://pastebin.com/bgHnawJf
[10:49:21] <davidmahoney> no one knows huh?
[10:50:40] <jessicard> Snwspeckle: http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jquery/1.7.2/highslide-software/highcharts.com/tree/master/samples/highcharts/demo/line-basic/ there's a jsfiddle of a line graph. you can trigger a redraw on the graph as well when someone buys a new ticket
[10:51:15] <DarkKnightCZ> jdelgado: http://jsfiddle.net/7X5nd/1/ => this is the map... and on area click url should be called, but in IE it isnt... if i bind .click() function to area, event is called only on doubleclick => http://jsfiddle.net/7X5nd/2/
[10:51:43] <DarkKnightCZ> disclaimer: its not really my code, and i know its awful :)
[10:51:51] <Snwspeckle> Would it be possible to make it so that if I add a new game, (tickets are relative to games), the graph will update with the oldest disappearing to the left and the new game loaded in from the right
[10:52:49] <jessicard> Snwspeckle: I'm not quite sure what you mean so its hard to say
[10:53:58] <Snwspeckle> So currently my database has a table for my games and tickets. I want the X axis to have the 5 latest added games and the Y axis to be the number of tickets sold for each of those games. Each ticket entry has an ID in them which makes them each relative to a game. Its possible to do this right?
[10:54:13] <jessicard> ah
[10:54:14] <jessicard> yes
[10:54:20] <jessicard> should be
[10:54:42] <Snwspeckle> Ok now lets say I add a new game, can I make it so that the oldest game on the chart go away and the newest be showed?
[10:55:03] <Snwspeckle> Basically I am creating a live AJAX line graph of the # of tickets sold for the 5 latest games
[10:55:34] <jessicard> yeah, that should work fine, you just need to redraw the entire graph then
[10:55:48] <Snwspeckle> Using the AJAX example right?
[10:55:52] <Snwspeckle> I should be able to work off of that
[10:57:37] <jessicard> on complete of the ajax call you can call a chart rerender
[10:58:16] <Snwspeckle> So in terms of my PHP code to get the data, how do you recommend I do this?
[10:59:34] <jessicard> in terms of php I'm not sure
[10:59:49] <Snwspeckle> Do I query for the X and Y axis seperatley?
[11:00:08] <NoiseEee> Snwspeckle: im not sure where ajax fits in / why its necessary at all / what benefit it provides?
[11:00:09] <abjorn> Well the first thing you do is throw away PHP and use something else
[11:00:17] <abjorn> jk jk
[11:00:28] <abjorn> (notreally)
[11:01:08] <NoiseEee> Snwspeckle: ahh i see why.  your options are polling the server every X seconds for new data, and re-drawing, or maybe using socket.io/nodeJS to push the new data when its actually changed
[11:11:35] <Ortund> Can anyone help me with this? It's meant to hide the VB code samples on page load and allow the user to switch between C# and VB code based on the button that they click... none of it works http://pastebin.com/bgHnawJf
[11:11:37] <Ortund> At all
[11:12:32] <aro> is there a way to resize an object using a child element of that object?
[11:12:34] <stream> what's the best way to preload all images in a html file, both inline and from the css?
[11:12:50] <aro> i like preload
[11:16:38] <StephenS> do you guys use json, or just plain text?
[11:17:12] <NoiseEee> StephenS: just plain text is severely limiting, don't you think?
[11:17:42] <Ortund> StephenS, I've used json... just basic send/receive to handler pages, you got anything I could maybe help with?
[11:18:14] <StephenS> Well when returning value inside some div, isn't equal json vs plain text?
[11:18:42] <StephenS> True, I can manipulate with data a bit more when using json, but for simple returning value, plain text is fine?
[11:19:04] <NoiseEee> StephenS: my vote is for consistency.
[11:19:18] <NoiseEee> and organization.
[11:19:31] <StephenS> but will json or plain text perform faster?
[11:19:36] <StephenS> I'm more for optimization
[11:19:56] <StephenS> because server side had to convert text to json and then to pass it through
[11:20:05] <Ortund> Heh well that I can't help you with... sorry
[11:20:14] <NoiseEee> StephenS: neither will yield a perceptible difference.
[11:20:27] <StephenS> with 10 millions request, it will.
[11:20:40] <NoiseEee> StephenS: sigh
[11:20:51] <NoiseEee> StephenS: "go for it" is that the answer you wanted?
[11:20:57] <StephenS> Nope
[11:21:06] <StephenS> I was looking for some discussion about performance :)
[11:21:13] <NoiseEee> its not a performance issue.
[11:21:23] <Ortund> It's the answer I'd take... whichever is fastest probably isn't that much faster that it'll make much difference anyway
[11:21:29] <NoiseEee> its a consistency, organization issue.
[11:21:43] <NoiseEee> "oh this code SOMETIMES expects JSON but OTHER TIMES text"
[11:21:58] <NoiseEee> "oh what, the data is slightly changed now? well just cram it in that line of text and make up a delimiter"
[11:22:15] <StephenS> How about if js is disabled?
[11:22:22] <NoiseEee> then how would your ajax work in the first place?
[11:22:29] <StephenS> User will get generated json no matter what
[11:22:33] <StephenS> Ajax won't work
[11:22:42] <StephenS> but user is still able to submit data
[11:22:55] <NoiseEee> thats up to you. i can't see how that fits into text vs json at all.
[11:23:16] <StephenS> And when submission is processed, he will go straight to ajax/process.php which contain json encoded and printed to the user side
[11:23:17] <NoiseEee> even if you were to parse text instead of json, it still requires JS.
[11:24:10] <Ortund> I'm stuck on what should be simpler issues... showing and hiding specific sets of content based on button click...

[11:46:29] <DarkHouse> good afternoon. i've been given a horrible task of making an entire site scroll vertically with parallax.
[11:47:03] <DarkHouse> i've got the site up, and i had some code that was almost working in place, but things just aren't lining up right. was wondering if anybody had any suggestions.
[11:47:18] <DarkHouse> also, i've tried a number of plugins, couldn't get any to work properly though
[11:49:52] <TimAshton> URL?
[11:50:05] <DarkHouse> http://flatiron.ca
[11:50:09] <Bloomberg_> afreeland: Is not setting the var when click the first li
[11:50:53] <Z3R0> Bloomberg_ what are you trying to return ?
[11:50:54] <afreeland> Bloomberg_, you have to make sure the variable is in scope for the other function to access it
[11:50:58] <DarkHouse> if you look at the source (i apologize for the copious amount of js in the head), you'll see there are basically 3 layers - background, midground and foreground
[11:51:24] <Z3R0> nvm I see now
[11:52:12] <DarkHouse> basically, my method was to add spacing between each of the foreground sections, and less space between the midground sections, and keep the background sections as they are.
[11:52:38] <Z3R0> fyi Bloomberg_
[11:52:49] <Z3R0> when I click on a LI element, the thCapt var = Element + Beijing
[11:52:51] <Z3R0> every time :)
[11:52:53] <DarkHouse> and then just make the background and midground scroll at different rates, based on the foreground position.
[11:52:55] <Z3R0> console.log(thCapt);
[11:53:00] <Z3R0> Convenios fiddle.jshell.net:26

[13:49:44] <Miguel_> Hello, I have a problem with a Tooltip plugin that I am working on. Could someone help me out?
[13:51:01] <Miguel_> The tooltip code is in http://codepen.io/mdmoura/pen/ckDhn. I was herer yesterday but the problem was not solved.
[13:51:15] <Miguel_> If someone could help me out I would appreciate. Thank You
[13:51:46] <Miguel_> I tried StackOverflow and JQuery Forums but no luck.
[13:55:03] <say2joe> Please describe your problem
[13:55:10] <fikst> Miguel_, what is the problem?
[13:55:57] <no_gravity> Hello! If you have some element like <h3 id=xyz>Lala</h3> whats the jquery way of changing Lala to something else?
[13:56:13] <Miguel_> Hello, if you go to the sample you will see that when I move the mouse away from the tooltip it will not disappear
[13:56:30] <NoiseEee> no_gravity: .html()
[13:56:55] <TimAshton> $("#xyz").html("New text here");
[13:57:03] <say2joe> $.text($("#xyz"),"some new text"); … but, html() is faster.
[13:57:04] <no_gravity> NoiseEee: $("#xyz").html("something else") ?
[13:57:11] <NoiseEee> yaj
[13:57:22] <Miguel_> I would like to have a few links in the tooltip. So I need to be able to place the mouse over the tooltip.

[14:04:47] <Miguel_> Anyone?
[14:06:12] <edlinde__> hi all, I haven't used jquery in a while now, and was wondering if it was possible to do some animation on google maps API using query?
[14:06:18] <fikst> Miguel_, http://codepen.io/anon/pen/beojB
[14:06:31] <edlinde__> for example, being able to zoom_in and zoom_out of regions
[14:06:48] <edlinde__> and shade a circular region on the map
[14:07:19] <fikst> Miguel_, does it work for you?
[14:07:39] <edlinde__> Can someone show me some examples of how I can make nice displays?
[14:08:11] <Miguel_> Yes it is working. thank You!
[14:08:19] <fikst> on your version, if I quickly moved over and out the <a> multiple #Tooltip were added
[14:08:37] <fikst> so there was always 1 removed, but the others were still visible
[14:09:09] <edlinde__> can I get some help? or is this not a good time to ask for help? :)
[14:09:09] <fikst> the only thing i changed was: $("#Tooltip").remove(); to $(".Tooltip").remove();
[14:09:14] <Miguel_> I see ... and is the approach the shedule a good option?
[14:09:16] <fikst> but its a dirt fix
[14:09:24] <fikst> dirty*
[14:10:13] <Miguel_> I tried this approach but I add another where I added the class "Active" to the tooltip and then looked for it but didn't work
[14:10:20] <Miguel_> why you say it is a dirt fix?
[14:11:37] <fikst> if you have multiple <a> on your page, each with its own tooltip, $(".Tooltip").remove() will affect all of them
[14:11:48] <fikst> but now that i think about it, thats not a problem
[14:12:09] <fikst> because its not possible to hover multiple tags at once :)
[14:12:55] <say2joe> hide() or detach() may be more efficient than remove()
[14:12:58] <Miguel_> I see ... I am not sure. Basically I am using this in a table where in each row i will have an icon. When I move the mouse over the icon I want to show a tooltip with a few links
[14:17:58] <Miguel_> say2joe, with hide does not seem to work. with detach it seems to work
[14:18:17] <Miguel_> I updeated my code http://codepen.io/mdmoura/pen/ckDhn and it seems to work by using class and not id
[14:18:32] <Miguel_> Does it work for you to?
[14:18:51] <johnq_> is it valid to do this $('.passstrength').html('Strong!').css('color:green;'); ?
[14:18:53] <Bloomberg> Guys!!
[14:19:10] <Bloomberg> Some function like html() but doesn't replace the text
[14:20:07] <NoiseEee> stop presses
[14:20:07] <NoiseEee> !!
[14:20:18] <say2joe> css({color:"gree"}) or css("color","green")
[14:21:24] <indyrl> What is the best, most simple method for keeping a script from loading twice?
[14:21:35] <johnq_> say2joe:  is it the same both options?
[14:25:44] <say2joe> johnq_: yes
[14:25:51] <johnq_> thanks
[14:25:55] <say2joe> (except my misspelling)
[14:27:24] <say2joe> however, object keys should use camelCase notation (backgroundSize: "contain") vs string value key ("background-size","contain")
[14:48:26] <YammYcoding> guys.  when in do  $(this).find(".outertab").find(".tab") , that means find the div.outertab then inside of it find the div.tab ?
[14:49:39] <fikst> yes, but $(this).find('.outertab .tab')
[14:50:03] <YammYcoding> can't i .find.find ?
[14:50:46] <fikst> yes you can
[14:50:47] <YammYcoding> $(this).parents(".tabs_table").find(".panes").find("#"+which).show();
[14:50:51] <YammYcoding> this is wrong?
[14:51:32] <YammYcoding> i have several tabs, as tab1 tab2 tab3,  the which tell me which i clicked to show. i need to hide the others
[14:52:10] <BryanRuiz> how do i get the html of an element and not the innerhtml?
[14:52:27] <YammYcoding> the order is like <tabs_table> <panes> <tab1><tab2> </panes> </tabs_table>
[14:53:16] <StephenS> when I make action="/some/foo" and using ajax for some button inside that form, I have whole page refreshed
[14:53:23] <sahbeewah> YammYcoding, IDs need to be unique. With that in mind, you can simply do $('#'+which).show();
[14:53:34] <StephenS> however, I wish to that action="" remain, as someone can disable javascript, so what are my other options?
[14:53:39] <StephenS> I do not want page reloaded..
[14:54:13] <YammYcoding> but what if i have more than one tabs_table in the same page?
[14:54:18] <YammYcoding> it can happen
[14:54:56] <fikst> yes, but you should only have 1 '#'+which
[14:56:30] <Pinkamena_D> what is the standard method for selecting something realitive to what called the function
[14:57:11] <Pinkamena_D> for example If i have $('#bt1').bind('click', function() { and I want to select the sibling or something in relation to #bt1
[14:57:43] <fikst> $(this).find('.foo')
[14:58:00] <sahbeewah> StephenS, you can't really prevent users from submitting the form normally, if they want to, they'll do it. just handle it gracefully if/when they do
[14:58:33] <StephenS> sahbeewah: form will be submitted, but to where?
[14:59:59] <sahbeewah> StephenS, the same page? not sure what you're asking
[15:01:36] <sahbeewah> BryanRuiz, try, $('<div>').append(element).html();
[15:02:08] <BryanRuiz> thx sahbeewah

[16:18:32] <relipse> is there a reason why my ajax request is returning success but "It has no preview available" in chrome debug network console
[16:27:17] <say2joe> relipse: the HTTP response is probably returning a 200 in the header

[16:34:14] <GaryOak_> rakl: I think it's returned via the ajax function scope
[16:35:00] <say2joe> I believe "this" within a deferred callback is the jqXHR object

[16:35:37] <rakl> $.ajax(//stuff).done(function(data){}).fail(function(){})
[16:36:31] <say2joe> just slap a debugger; statement as first line in callback (fail() method)
[16:36:43] <rakl> heh yeah don't have debugger statements
[16:36:59] <rakl> writing javascript in a phone gap app that is compiled to android
[16:37:13] <say2joe> oh. ouch.
[16:37:15] <GaryOak_> rakl: I know that feel
[16:37:21] * rakl is questioning his sanity
[16:37:37] <rakl> console.log is my friend
[16:38:54] <say2joe> what!?! no love for alert!
[16:39:22] <GaryOak_> 40 alerts on your android emulator *cries*
[16:39:32] <say2joe> LOL
[16:39:51] <say2joe> I haven't used alert in years — and, am thankful!
[16:40:48] <GaryOak_> rakl: I'm wondering if .ajax() even sends back an xhr object on a fail
[16:41:22] <rakl> hmm. when it was .error() it did
[16:41:53] <GaryOak_> say2joe: iOS w/ PhoneGap will only mention the line of the function that caused the error, that really sucks
[16:42:14] <rakl> iOS at least has a debugger
[16:42:24] <rakl> for android i'm testing in an actual device
[16:43:13] <say2joe> GaryOak_: at least safari supports remote debugging :)
[16:45:16] <GaryOak_> rakl: From the jquery docs: For failed requests the arguments are the same as those of .fail(): the jqXHR object, textStatus, and errorThrown.
[16:46:15] <rakl> GaryOak_ huh where did you see that? http://api.jquery.com/deferred.fail/ just talks about the callbacks
[16:46:22] <GaryOak_> So something like .ajax().done().fail(function(xhrObj, status, error){...})
[16:46:37] <rakl> oh i see
[16:49:52] <Pinkamena_D> Hello, can anyone tell me why this iframe spills over into the button? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/AorCa

[17:27:09] <blindMoe> anyone ever successfully made isotope or masonry tile 3 different block sizes together?  I have a 1x1 a 1x2 and a 2x1 ( aspect ration not px size )  and it always seems to leave holes at certain browser widths

[17:39:57] <coldhead> thanks bots
[17:54:34] <oreth> i want to be able to drag some text (from my desktop or other program) onto a droppable element and kick off a parsing routine
[17:54:58] <oreth> i haven't been able to figure out how to make an element droppable to an external source
[17:55:10] <oreth> i see people do it all the time with uploads
[17:55:20] <oreth> but i want to instead use text
[17:55:53] <Mrgoose2> howdy
[17:56:07] <Mrgoose2> http://pastie.org/7638303 , i have this inside of a javascript class.  How do i access this inside the showVirtualTerminal function
[17:59:16] <momomomomo> Mrgoose2: Turn it into a function?
[17:59:41] <coldhead> AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN THERE'S NO ONE WATCHING
[18:01:25] <tw2113> somebody's watching meeee
[18:04:26] <Mrgoose2> momomomomo: it is a function
[18:05:04] <momomomomo> Mrgoose2: It's an anonymous function
[18:05:53] <Mrgoose2> momomomomo: http://pastie.org/7638455 , this is what i have
[18:05:58] <Mrgoose2> what am i doing wrong?
[18:06:39] <Mrgoose2> shouldnt be anonymous
[18:06:49] <awc737> is there a simple way of saying "if condition, do not iterrate i"
[18:06:50] <awc737> $.each(p.pages[pageNumber], function(i, row) {
[18:07:03] <awc737> if a condition is not met, i'd like this loop to happen again
[18:07:30] <momomomomo> Mrgoose2: http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp
[18:08:19] <Mrgoose2> i shouldnt have to pass this into the argument
[18:09:40] <momomomomo> oh, I think I've misunderstood your question
[18:11:44] <awc737> how can I do an each loop over again, if a condition is not met
[18:12:00] <blindMoe> awc737: sounds like a setup for an endless loop
[18:12:36] <coldhead> var finished = false; while (! finished ) { $.each(... finished = true; ... ); }
[18:13:07] <awc737> hmm
[18:13:11] <blindMoe> anyone ran into an issue with masonry where a browser resize leaves things out of whack but refreshing at that size fixes the problems?
[18:18:28] <Mrgoose2> momomomomo:   self.showVirtualTerminalQuestions( $(this) ); , i had to do that
[18:18:29] <Mrgoose2> seems messy
[18:19:30] <momomomomo> Mrgoose2: increase performance a tiny bit and assign $this = $(this)
[18:19:38] <momomomomo> at the beginning of your func
[18:21:43] <phizes> blindMoe: yes, and for fear you won't get a better answer, I think you may have to tell masonry to re-align itself, what you call to do this I fail to remember :(
[18:22:44] <blindMoe> phizes: tried that :/
[18:22:53] <blindMoe> $colLeft.isotope( 'reLayout' )
[18:23:12] <blindMoe> pretty annoying problem.. didn't think it would take this long to get masonry / isotope to play nice
[18:23:29] <coldhead> isotope is hard going
[18:23:44] <phizes> Hmm, haven't used it with isotope, on infinite load :(
[18:24:11] <blindMoe> wonder if masonry would be any different
[18:24:23] <blindMoe> from what I have read isotype uses masonry's layout engine so I would imagine it is the same
[18:24:49] <coldhead> masonry does less so it's easier to work with
[18:25:02] <coldhead> isotope has more scope for things to go wrong
[18:25:05] <blindMoe> good point.. maybe I'll switch it over really quick
[18:25:19] <wookiehangover> also, isotope has a nasty license
[18:25:25] <coldhead> i've seen grown men pull their own heads off in frustration trying to get isotope working
[18:25:28] <blindMoe> I am on maybe my forth or fifth layout now with this
[18:25:32] <coldhead> oh god yes, the non freeness :(
[18:25:40] <blindMoe> coldhead: you might see another one here soon
[18:25:50] <systemfault> wookiehangover: Then use jquery masonry
[18:25:59] <blindMoe> if isotope would just work I would not mind paying $25 at all
[18:25:59] <coldhead> blindMoe: i've become numb to the horror
[18:26:04] <blindMoe> haha
[18:26:15] <systemfault> http://masonry.desandro.com/ ;)
[18:26:57] <wookiehangover> http://i.gif.ly/e440af72.gif
[18:26:59] <systemfault> http://masonry.desandro.com/demos/animating-css-transitions.html If it's not isotope-like… then I'm Michael Jackson
[18:27:11] <myhrlin> systemfault: beat it
[18:27:30] <systemfault> b-b-b-b-beat it!!!!!! OW!
[18:27:35] <blindMoe> systemfault: isotope is built from masonry.. by the same guy
[18:27:55] <blindMoe> for how many template designers sell their templates using his work I don't think it is unfair to ask for a little cut off the top ;)
[18:28:08] <coldhead> I CAN'T HOLD WHAT'S IN MY HAND
[18:31:48] <blindMoe> wow masonry definitely is working a lot cleaner
[18:31:52] <tw2113> maybe if you tried for once in your life coldhead ! :D
[18:32:28] <tw2113> hey everyone, coldhead's first name is gunther
[18:34:56] <blindMoe> masonry ftw ... cya guys manana.. I am done
[18:37:12] <tw2113> why does pinterest hate society and make people want that type of layout?
[18:37:38] <coldhead> also where is their API
[18:38:47] <chinoto> I was testing creating an html fragment with jquery's $(html,attributes) syntax compared to generating a string, found that string was faster, amidoingitwrong? http://jsbin.com/ukucad/2/edit
[18:43:52] <chinoto> guess I'll be using strings when it's easier/needed for performance
[18:43:58] <coldhead> YOUR HAIR SPREAD OUT / ON THE PILLOW / IN A BLACK FAN / I BURIED MY FAITH / I TRADED YOU
[18:44:08] <chinoto> ...k?
[18:46:18] <chinoto> apparently html instead of text makes the first one slightly faster than before, but nowhere near the second: http://jsbin.com/ukucad/3/edit
[18:46:41] <coldhead> ?interesting
[18:46:41] <bot-t> Hmm, very interesting https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/6972452864/h754A9258/.gif
[18:47:03] <chinoto> -_-
[18:48:32] <coldhead> YOU WERE LYING ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR
[18:48:44] <chinoto> http://www.memes.at/faces/no.jpg
[18:57:47] <anew> so are we supposed to use on() now ?
[18:57:50] <anew> is that the latest
[18:58:24] <coldhead> yup
[18:59:04] <chinoto> anew: should have been using it for awhile now...
[18:59:16] <anew> yeah i was, just double checking
[18:59:23] <chinoto> ah
[19:00:28] <chinoto> wondering if there's some new shiny function that replaces .on() like .on() did to .live(), .delegate(), and probably some other functions?
[19:00:44] <anew> yeah pretty much
[19:00:59] <anew> just making sure i was using the newest
[19:09:03] <anew> so selecting from a drop down is on('change',
[19:09:04] <anew> right
[19:09:12] <Gazpacho> cinoto: no, .on is the way, truth and light
[19:09:15] <tsheva> is on() bubling event or capturing ?
[19:09:29] <chinoto> anew: yes, but you can also use .change()
[19:09:31] <systemfault> Always bubbling..
[19:09:56] <Gazpacho> every day i'm bubblin
[19:10:01] <systemfault> Only netscape fans love capturing
[19:15:29] <chinoto> It seems like many times when I look for a performance comparison of patterns, there is usually something that is done that makes an alternative slower than it would normally be, then I end up writing my own benchmark...
[19:19:04] <bel3atar_> How do I use the mothods in http://welldonethings.com/tags/manager ?
[19:30:09] <papucho> hello, I'm trying to append an imput inside a div, the problem is that when I submit the form, the data from those input, aren't send to the host. I use the .append function to do that. And I checked if that information is in the headers and they're not.
[19:31:20] <chinoto> papucho: did you give the input a name?
[19:32:50] <papucho> yes, and i'm giving it a dynamic name, look: http://pastebin.com/pfqTD9mH
[19:38:18] <papucho> chinoto: ?
[19:38:44] <chinoto> I closed the window, wasn't actively checking chat
[19:39:10] <papucho> chinoto: yes, and i'm giving it a dynamic name, look: http://pastebin.com/pfqTD9mH
[19:39:24] <chinoto> I already got the link
[19:39:39] <Andrew_R> papucho: is #campos inside your <form> (and do you only have 1 #campos?)
[19:40:53] <papucho> Andrew_R: Yes, I have the #campos inside the form, and yes, I've just one #campos
[19:41:44] <papucho> I can see the input when I click #campos, the problem is when submitting the form, the information inside these input are not sent
[19:41:45] <chinoto> I'm working on a form right now, I'll try testing it
[19:41:51] <Andrew_R> papucho: I don't see any problems with the code you pasted
[19:43:42] <papucho> Andrew_R: The code that i pasted was to show how did I append the input fields, the problem is that when submitting those input's information are not send
[19:45:54] <chinoto> my form had many errors to work out >.>
[19:46:07] <chinoto> and forgot content-type header
[19:46:28] <chinoto> jquery doesn't like it when it doesn't get the right header :3
[19:46:50] <tsheva> interesting chinoto
[19:47:43] <Dexx1_> can someone check lines 5-12 of my JQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/puTwA/ -- right now, all I am trying to do is HIDE the <p> elements on page load
[19:49:20] <ryez> if I create a button programmatically, how do I bind a click call back to the button? for me the blocker is I don't know how to get 'this' for the button
[19:50:22] <Andrew_R> Dexx1_: http://jsfiddle.net/puTwA/1/
[19:50:52] <Andrew_R> you had a couple things set up wrong in jsfiddle, you select the jquery library from the left column "Frameworks & Extensions"
[19:51:14] <chinoto> ryez: select the element somehow, then say $elem.click(function(){console.log(this)})
[19:51:23] <Andrew_R> you don't need to wrap $(document).ready() around your code (the "onLoad" drop down tells jsfiddle to do that automatically)
[19:51:25] <Dexx1_> Andrew_R: thanks. wait. what did I do wrong again?
[19:51:31] <Dexx1_> was it a "settings" issue or a "code" issue
[19:51:34] <Andrew_R> and the script and style tags aren't needed
[19:51:56] <Andrew_R> also, you were missing the .hide class in your css
[19:52:22] <chinoto> ryez: actually, you'll need to show some code I think, didn't quite read what you said
[19:53:04] <Andrew_R> ryez: you can set up your event handlers before adding it
[19:53:30] <ryez> thank you, let me try to setup a fiddle for showcase
[19:53:47] <Dexx1_> Andrew_R: this is fine right: <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js"></script> ?
[19:54:11] <Andrew_R> var $link = $('<a href="#"/>).text('Click this').click(function(){ // handle click event }); $link.appendTo('#container');
[19:54:33] <Andrew_R> Dexx1_: no, you don't need it, select the jquery version you want from the dropdown
[19:55:12] <Dexx1_> Andrew_R: I meant, if I have a .html file locally... i think thats the issue
[19:55:35] <chinoto> papucho: dynamically added input worked fine in my form
[19:56:01] <chinoto> ooh new updates for zfs :D
[19:56:16] <Andrew_R> Dexx1_: oh yeah, that is ok then
[19:56:47] <Dexx1_> Andrew_R: I don't understand why it doesnt work when I open it in chrome locally but it works in jsfiddle X_x
[19:57:20] <chinoto> papucho: all I did was this: $form.append('<input name="blah2">')
[19:58:00] <papucho> chinoto: but, I want to add it inside a div, inside the form tag.
[19:58:21] <chinoto> shouldn't make a difference
[19:58:50] <papucho> chinoto: but when you submit the form, is the input value in the headers?, I mean.. was it sent?
[19:59:48] <Dexx1_> any ideas on why it works on jsfiddle but not locally when opened with chrome?!
[19:59:56] <chinoto> well I don't believe the json_encoded $_REQUEST in my alert that was came out of thin air :P
[19:59:57] <papucho> chinoto: in my form i've got both... dynamically added inputs and not dynamic inputs, the non dynamic inputs are send when submitting but the dynamic ones are not.
[20:00:21] <Andrew_R> Dexx1_: check your console output for errors
[20:00:35] <chinoto> inspect the html to see if the input have names
[20:00:43] <papucho> chinoto: is it possible to see your code?
[20:01:39] <Dexx1_> Andrew_R: this is what it looks like too: http://jsbin.com/oxobuv/1/edit
[20:02:08] <Dexx1_> console output doesnt show anything..
[20:02:15] <Andrew_R> Dexx1_: you are missing the $(document).ready()
[20:02:17] <chinoto> papucho: http://jsbin.com/ijahov/1/edit
[20:02:40] <chinoto> it's generated by php, data is pull from mysql
[20:03:30] <Dexx1_> Andrew_R: oh duh...jsfiddle doesn't require that!?
[20:04:07] <Andrew_R> Dexx1_: nope, with the "onLoad" drop down selected (by default) is wraps whatever code you enter in the script area with that
[20:05:11] <chinoto> this form was copied from another one I had, which is why the pointless $.extend is there
[20:05:21] <Dexx1_> oh i see
[20:05:25] <papucho> chinoto: it seems that you are submitting the form with jquery (ajax) what about when you submit it by a normal input type submit?
[20:05:51] <chinoto> I guess I could make an iframe...
[20:12:08] <chinoto> it works, I got back: {"dialog":"sc_engine\/add_contact2track","blah":"1","submit":"Submit","blah2":"sdfasdfasdf"} (http://jsbin.com/ijahov/1/edit)
[20:15:18] <Dexx1_> Andrew_R: so I want to add my own PLUS and MINUS sign IMAGE to the left of each title so the user can toggle on/off appropriately... any advice on that?
[20:16:46] <Andrew_R> papucho: http://jsbin.com/ipajuh/1/edit this works, I'm seeing all static and dynamic inputs being passed in the parameters
[20:17:01] <Dexx1_> Andrew_R: can I do something like:   $("img[src*=plusSign.png]").addClass("plusSign");
[20:18:30] <Andrew_R> Dexx1_: maybe instead of images, use a div with a background which is set by your style
[20:19:01] <Andrew_R> then in your click handler, switch the classes
[20:19:59] <_bruno> Thanks to everyone to help me with my first theme in Themeforest :) http://themeforest.net/item/city-nightlife-responsive-multipurpose-theme/4540302
[20:20:08] <Dexx1_> Andrew_R: I see.. I want to try the image method for practice..I guess..how can I configure a background image for each heading element?
[20:20:54] <ryez> chinoto, Andrew_R: it works without magic using plain 'this', see http://jsfiddle.net/UdWhS/4/
[20:21:19] <Andrew_R> Dexx1_: that part is just html and css, put it wherever you want, and use jQuery do do the class switching
[20:23:46] <Andrew_R> Dexx1_: oh I see what you are saying, yes you could put the image as a background right on the h2
[20:24:06] <Andrew_R> you still need two different styles though, one for each background image
[20:26:43] <Dexx1_> Andrew_R: are there any examples of this online?
[20:27:35] <papucho> Andrew_R: It works, but I'm doing the same thing with my code and doesn't work :S
[20:38:14] <louism2_> hey guys/gals, I am new to javascript/jquery and I have a question regarding the jquery submit() method.  I am trying to implement stripe and I am using a two step process to validate form data and then submit the form to my server once I know the form data is correct.  I am intercepting the submit button click, validating data, and then using the $form.submit() method to submit the form.  The form is supposed to submit via ajax as I
[20:38:14] <louism2_>  have the 'data-remote' attribute set to true but I can't get this to work.  My question is this: does intercepting the submit button click and the using the jquery submit() function mess with the ajax functionality?  https://gist.github.com/louism2/5409888
[20:38:16] <louism2_> thanks
[20:39:58] <chinoto> louism2_: side note: only do rudimentary checking on the client, it isn't really worth doing since the user can do a manual post
[20:40:55] <chinoto> louism2_: btw, I hadn't looked at your code when I said that .>
[20:40:56] <louism2_> chinoto: thanks, I don't do it much for that reason but the stripe api requires me to submit that form data to the them so they can return a request token
[20:40:58] <chinoto> >.>*
[20:42:23] <chinoto> louism2_: why are you simply wrapping a function?
[20:42:47] <chinoto> the setupForm function seems redundant
[20:43:48] <chinoto> in any case, it shouldn't interfere unless you use event.preventDefault()
[20:45:12] <chinoto> louism2_: if the submit needs to happen after the "Stripe.createToken()" function, then you may have issues
[20:45:17] <datarecall_> Hey Guy's im trying to get the id of the first row of a table using : var row = $(this).closest('table').children('tr:first').attr('id');
[20:45:31] <datarecall_> but it keeps returning undefined
[20:45:42] <papucho> chinoto, Andrew_R: thanks for your help, finally solved the issue, it was weird because I had the inputs and the form inside a table, just took the form outside the table (taking the whole table inside the form) and it worked.
[20:45:58] <chinoto> datarecall_: use find instead of children
[20:46:23] <chinoto> datarecall_: it's because some browsers wrap your <tr>s in a <tbody>
[20:47:14] <louism2_> chinoto: I appreciate the help, can you look at the gist?  I am indeed calling submit after adding that stripe token to the form:  https://gist.github.com/louism2/5409888
[20:47:42] <datarecall_> chinto, hmm that still returns undefined. Does it change if the table is being loaded by ajax
[20:48:04] <chinoto> datarecall_: shouldn't
[20:48:40] <chinoto> louism2_: didn't notice the return false, that should actually prevent the submit from following through
[20:49:30] <chinoto> dunno if you can manually submit a form, might work
[20:50:31] <datarecall_> ok so :first is grabbing the th, is there a good way to grab the second ?
[20:51:11] <chinoto> :nth-child(2)
[20:53:00] <datarecall_> awesome one last thing chinoto how would i go about deleting that specific row now
[20:53:02] <chinoto> datarecall_: you shouldn't be getting a th though since you're looking for a tr... right?
[20:53:11] <chinoto> .remove()
[20:53:12] <b-ot> chinoto: firing because .slideUp() is already executed, though it is still animating
[20:53:25] <chinoto> eh?!?
[20:53:27] <chinoto> .remove()
[20:53:27] <b-ot> chinoto: firing because .slideUp() is already executed, though it is still animating
[20:53:38] <chinoto> ok...
[20:57:41] <jeremyabel> hello jquery friends
[20:58:07] <jeremyabel> so, I haven't used jquery much, and I'm trying to fix a bug in some code a coworker wrote
[20:58:47] <datarecall_> hmmm chinotovar tid = $('#commenttable').find('tr:nth-child(2)').attr('id'); is for some reason grabbing the 2nd row, after the <th> but if i change it to child(1) it grabs the header row
[20:59:05] <jeremyabel> I have a function that binds the 'mousemove' event when you click something, and it works great in chrome, but in firefox, the bind happens 3 times, but then it doesn't happen any more after that until I release the mouse, and then it sticks to it
[20:59:14] <jeremyabel> whereas in chrome it unbinds on release, as intended
[21:00:33] <Dexx1_> Andrew_R: figured it out..now I need to figure out how to "underline" upon mouseover
[21:12:41] <cincyguy5646> Can someone tell me why the active tab still fires. I know its stops it correctly before the first change http://jsfiddle.net/ycWh8/
[21:19:33] <Dexx1_> is this the correct way to show a 'effect' upon mouseover? http://jsbin.com/aluloh/1/edit
[21:24:56] <Dexx1_> what are some "effects" like underline for mouseover?
[21:26:35] <cincyguy5646> dexx1 ... $('h2').bind('mouseenter mouseleave', function() { $(this).toggleClass('effect'); });
[21:27:36] <Dexx1_> cincyguy5646: thats what I am doing... what's the 'effect' ? I want to simply underline
[21:27:58] <Dexx1_> cincyguy5646: see my previous: http://jsbin.com/aluloh/1/edit
[21:28:20] <cincyguy5646> it's a simply css declaration... .effect { text-decoration:underline; }
[21:28:31] <cincyguy5646> simple*
[21:28:38] <Dexx1_> oh
[21:28:50] <cincyguy5646> you dont even need jquery for it
[21:29:08] <Dexx1_> ohh
[21:29:10] <cincyguy5646> h2 { text-decoration:none } and h2:hover { text-decoration:underline }
[21:32:05] <cincyguy5646> Can someone tell me why the active tab still fires. I know its stops it correctly before the first change http://jsfiddle.net/ycWh8/
[21:39:39] <cincyguy5646> anyone out there?
[21:41:59] <coldhead> cincyguy5646: i've no idea but http://jsfiddle.net/ycWh8/1/
[21:43:52] <cincyguy5646> gracias cold
[21:44:47] <cincyguy5646> according to the API :not(.active) should work the same way
[21:45:39] <coldhead> well yes
[21:45:39] <coldhead> but
[21:45:42] <coldhead> .on()
[21:45:48] <coldhead> it gets tricky
[21:45:55] <cincyguy5646> is delegate or bind better?
[21:46:04] <coldhead> i prefer to handle that kind of filtering in the hollaback
[21:46:22] <coldhead> rather than make the delegate code handle active and inactive states
[21:46:44] <coldhead> i prefer to attach a single handler to the element and make the handler intelligent
[21:46:53] <coldhead> rather than have an intelligent/tricky selector
[21:46:59] <coldhead> it's a matter of taste
[21:47:06] <coldhead> and in this case my taste prefers the thing that works :D
[21:47:13] <cincyguy5646> indeed
[21:47:30] <cincyguy5646> well.. kudos for that one
[21:47:41] <cincyguy5646> me and my coworker scratched our heads for an hour on that one today
[21:48:05] <cincyguy5646> only because im stubborn of course..
[21:52:14] <cincyguy5646> coldhead would propagation be a possible cause?
[21:52:42] <coldhead> i don't see how
[21:52:55] <coldhead> i would expect yours to work
[21:53:03] <coldhead> so it could be an actual bona fide jquery bug
[21:53:18] <cincyguy5646> yay for finding one of those
[22:07:30] <abjorn> coldhead: surely not, jquery haaas no bugs
[22:30:00] <relipse> is there a tool to take html source code and make it work with all ABSOLUTE urls provided you provide the base-url ?
[22:36:41] <tw2113> bot-t is going crazy
[22:39:52] <cpg> hi, i have a question about adding things to the DOM via ajax
[22:39:59] <cpg> when some event, like a click, causes things to get added to the DOM, e.g. through an ajax call
[22:40:04] <cpg> do the new elements get bindings like prior elements?
[22:40:27] <cpg> e.g. elements had a class "toggable" … and when they are clicked, something happens
[22:40:36] <cpg> (i.e. there was some code that would toggle something when these are clicked)
[22:40:52] <cpg> now if i add more toggables, e.g. via ajax, do they also have that code attached to these new elements?
[22:48:57] <coldhead> hungry bread and butter hustle
[22:54:39] <jan_n> cpg: use .on() and bind it to the container you put the new elements in. then your newly added elements can trigger functions.
[22:55:25] <jan_n> cpg: $('#mycontainer').on('click', '.toggable', functio(){ console.log("got clicked"); });
[22:55:29] <cpg> jan_n: i am using on
[22:55:33] <cpg> but maybe not correctly
[22:55:34] <cpg> moment
[22:55:39] <jan_n> jsfiddle it.
[22:56:13] <jan_n> cpg: note, you can't bind an event to $('.toggable').on() and expect it to work with newly added elements.
[22:56:15] <cpg> it's the first 4 lines in https://github.com/amahi/platform/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/lib/application.js.coffee
[22:56:45] <jan_n> yeah, you need to modify that.
[22:56:55] <cpg> i am noob to jq
[22:57:16] <cpg> this code was sadly inherited by me and i am ramping up
[22:57:24] <jan_n>  $(".stretchtoggle").on "click" ->  $("body").on("click", ".stretchtoggle"...
[22:57:45] <cpg> i see
[22:58:17] <jan_n> (then replace body with the parent node where you insert your stretchtoggles)
[22:58:47] <jan_n> maybe someone converted .live() to .on() without knowing what they where doing?
[22:59:03] <cpg> jan_n: i did that
[22:59:06] <cpg> precisely
[22:59:25] <cpg> i read the docs, but clearly need more intros
[22:59:33] <jan_n> no, you need to really read the docs.
[22:59:54] <jan_n> http://api.jquery.com/live/
[23:00:12] <jan_n> it clearly gives an example on how to convert live to on().
[23:00:37] <jan_n> cpg: look for the text Rewriting , and not the position of selector.
[23:01:03] <relipse>  can someone please answer my question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16075546/convert-full-html-source-code-relative-paths-to-absolute-paths-php-or-javascript
[23:01:10] <cpg> jan_n: good pointers. thanks … reading ...
[23:01:13] <tw2113> the two code blocks under "As of jQuery 1.7"
[23:18:15] <garbagegod> I'm looking to load a @font-face on the fly, and the only solution I've found is http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7282151/load-external-font-with-javascript-and-jquery
[23:18:21] <garbagegod> Which is awful
[23:18:35] <garbagegod> Is there no better way to add @font-face's with jQuery/JS?
[23:18:40] <tw2113> why does it need to be on the fly?
[23:19:07] <garbagegod> I'm doing a utility that pulls in JSON from google font api and renders previews when you select a font to preview...
[23:19:19] <tw2113> ah
[23:19:39] <garbagegod> If that's the only way so be it, just wondering if anyone knew off the top of their head
[23:19:39] <cpg> jan_n: tw2113: the change you propsed worked well. thanks. any pointers you can suggest to really understand why this works? best i can tell is because the on is attached to a parent, the evaluation is done on that element dinamically a click time?
[23:20:06] <tw2113> all i did was point out where in the docs the info was
[23:20:10] <tw2113> i'm useless otherwise
[23:20:22] <cpg> lol
[23:20:32] <cpg> still, appreciated
[23:20:33] <tw2113> garbagegod, you'd have to find a way to construct the link that google fonts gives you
[23:20:53] <tw2113> and then also attach some css that uses it afterwards
[23:20:56] <tw2113> theoretically
[23:21:37] <garbagegod> Someone earlier showed me a google service you could make a request to that would return the correct CSS
[23:21:40] <garbagegod> I need to find that
[23:21:53] <tw2113> garbagegod, did you see the javascript tab that google fonts provides?
[23:22:12] <garbagegod> got it. http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Noto+Serif:400,700
[23:22:18] <garbagegod> tw2113: yeah, and I'm using that
[23:22:27] <garbagegod> but I can't figure out how to make it load fonts on the fly
[23:22:36] <wer0ckz> Hi guys. Please help. http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/SaPcd/ - IE8 issue. The overlay background, i can still click the div button that it should not. It's working fine using IE9, chrome and firefox
[23:22:39] <garbagegod> if you could point me in the right direction that would be awesome
[23:23:06] <tw2113> never done it, so i can't point to accurate resources for sure
[23:23:14] <tw2113> but one would think adding to the WebFontConfig object would be a good start
[23:23:24] <garbagegod> their example just shows the creation of a WebFontConfig object
[23:23:37] <garbagegod> let me see if that does anything
[23:24:01] <wer0ckz> Hi guys. Please help. http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/SaPcd/ - IE8 issue. The overlay background, i can still click the div button that it should not. It's working fine using IE9, chrome and firefox - See screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/yXcUMUY.png
[23:24:57] <garbagegod> I also found what I was looking for a minute ago: http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Noto+Serif:400,700 which is plan B.
[23:26:00] <coldhead> great work, gg
[23:28:09] <tw2113> so many ways to grab their data
[23:28:36] <tw2113> it's the least they can do for the amount they collect on you
[23:28:56] <garbagegod> indeed
[23:30:22] <garbagegod> so right here: https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/webfont_loader#Example
[23:30:46] <garbagegod> If you push another font family into WebFontConfig immediately after it's defined, it loads correctly
[23:31:05] <garbagegod> but after the execution of the function following it, you can no longer do that
[23:31:50] <garbagegod> (line ~7 of that example code)
[23:33:39] <garbagegod> Interestingly enough though, if you wrap it in a function and call it after extending WebFontConfig, it works
[23:34:12] <garbagegod> but it seems nasty, somehow
[23:35:27] <garbagegod> thoughts / opinions?
[23:35:34] <garbagegod> Let me know if I need to clarify anything
[23:37:17] <wer0ckz> Hi guys. Please help. http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/SaPcd/ - IE8 issue. The overlay background, i can still click the div button that it should not. It's working fine using IE9, chrome and firefox - See screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/yXcUMUY.png
[23:39:04] <garbagegod> wer0ckz: Have you tried not using IE8?
[23:39:13] <jan_n> :)
[23:41:47] <wer0ckz> <garbagegod> wer0ckz: Have you tried not using IE8? - yes it works fine using IE9, chrome and firefox
[23:43:03] <Cork> wer0ckz: what's the testcase suppose to look like and what's it doing?
[23:43:13] <Cork> i don't see any buttons in it
[23:43:33] <garbagegod> Sweet, so after reading on their GitHub repo, the docs are somewhat old and now you can just call WebFont.Load() in any context
[23:46:04] <coldhead> what can i offer you? conversations in the rain?
[23:46:24] <wer0ckz> not really a button but the links should pop-up a dialog-box
[23:46:47] <wer0ckz> it should not be able to click the background or links on the background when the dialog pops-up
[23:54:10] <wer0ckz> Hi guys. Please help. http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/SaPcd/ - IE8 issue. The overlay background, i can still click the div button that it should not. It's working fine using IE9, chrome and firefox - See screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/yXcUMUY.png
