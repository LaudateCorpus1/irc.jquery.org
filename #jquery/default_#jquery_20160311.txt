[00:24:14] <Mark____> how do i make a layer that has display:none value to fadeIn and fadeOut?
[00:24:21] <Mark____> show(200) hide(200) didn’;t work.
[03:10:52] <Mark____> does anyone know of a parallax jquery plugin that works on all browsers?
[03:19:13] <jomofcw> Morning =).
[03:45:39] <noregret>  i have several <select>s and I want to get the val() of each one, is there something i can use to get them all in one go? instead of calling .val() on each one
[03:56:07] <Mark____> quick help.
[03:56:24] <Mark____> does anyone know why $('#acc_layer').click(function(){
[03:56:24] <Mark____>         $('#acc_layer').hide(200); this doesn’t work on my website? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe2/index.php?mid=index
[03:59:23] <Cork> Mark____: first use $(this).hide() inside the event handler
[03:59:47] <Cork> Mark____: secondly, you most likely add the element after the handler is looking for it, so it never gets added
[04:00:15] <Cork> the simplest solution is to add it to a static parent instead $(parent).on('click', '#acc_layer', func)
[04:00:58] <Cork> noregret: yes, and no $('select').map(function() { return $(this).val(); }).get();
[04:11:15] <Mark____> okay
[04:11:24] <Mark____> why don’t know why it took me so long time to see your answer
[04:11:28] <Mark____> so $(parent).on('click', '#acc_layer', func) this will do?
[04:11:46] <Mark____> what is func?
[04:11:59] <Mark____> do i type in hide(200)?
[04:13:54] <Mark____> doesnt work.
[04:20:29] <Uhkis> its the callback function to be run
[06:06:59] <sheyla> Hi guys, i've got a problem with jquery loader. I include jquery and jquery loader. If i try to do
[06:06:59] <sheyla>                     $.loader({
[06:06:59] <sheyla>                         className:"blue-with-image-2",
[06:06:59] <sheyla>                         content:''
[06:06:59] <sheyla>                     });
[06:07:41] <sheyla> At the start, all works right. But if i put that in $(document).on("click", ".test", function(event) { ... });
[06:07:55] <sheyla> I get $.loader is not a function
[06:24:13] <vdeep> sheyla can you share your code on jsbin?
[06:32:49] <sheyla> vdeep, thanks for answer, i found the solution to my problem ^^
[06:33:49] <vdeep> sheyla cheers! happy coding
[06:33:56] <sheyla> Thank you.
[07:16:50] <Devrim> Could someone tell me how I could extract "TheOtherStream" as a var? https://jsfiddle.net/Lj7jk6fq/
[07:17:56] <Uhkis> Devrim: use .text()
[07:18:01] <Devrim> thanks
[07:44:09] <arup_r> If I open the dropdown, and then click on the button.. dropdown is getting closed. I don't want to close the dropdown.. it should be closed only when I will click on the dropdown itself. https://jsbin.com/vehizununu/1/edit?html,css,output how to fix it?
[07:46:28] <Abhijit> hi
[07:46:45] <Abhijit> whats the correct way to detect if a specific radio button is selected (on click) in given form?
[07:46:57] <arup_r> hi Abhijit :)
[07:47:01] <Abhijit> :-D
[07:47:30] <arup_r> what do you mean by specific radio button?
[07:48:02] <Abhijit> arup_r, i have a radio button with  name = comment[user_id] if this is clicked then i have to set a particular form hidden value.
[07:48:07] <Abhijit> how can i do that?
[07:48:47] <Abhijit> arup_r, currently i am doing $('.feed').on('click', 'input[name=\'comment[user_id]\']', function() { which do not work
[07:49:22] <arup_r> ok
[07:49:49] <Uhkis> how about making sense and doing: 'input[name="comment[user_id]"]' instead
[07:50:04] <arup_r> Abhijit: ^
[07:50:23] <arup_r> I am also thinking your selector as buggy.. try what Uhkis sad
[07:50:26] <arup_r> said*
[07:51:08] <Abhijit> Uhkis, that too dont work.
[07:51:14] <arup_r> ok.
[07:51:40] <Abhijit> $('.feed').on('click', 'input[name="comment[user_id]"]', function() { do not work
[07:51:42] <Uhkis> Abhijit: so, make a fiddle
[07:51:53] <Abhijit> ok
[07:52:19] <arup_r> Abhijit: copy the full html form, from browser inspector
[07:52:32] <arup_r> and make a fiddle with your current relevant JS
[07:52:56] <arup_r> Any body can see the content inside my JS bin link? I am confirming myself
[07:52:59] <Abhijit> ok
[07:53:41] <lilalinu_> How do I het the height of the outermost window from within an iframe?
[07:58:20] <Abhijit> arup_r, Uhkis while creating fiddle i realized i am using icheck and hence will have to use their method!
[07:58:51] <Abhijit> arup_r, one question though. how would i set a form hidden value from jquery?
[07:58:51] <Uhkis> :)
[07:59:13] <Uhkis> $('yourelement').val('value')
[08:00:10] <Abhijit> yourelement is id of that hidden field or name of that hidden field? Uhkis ?
[08:00:44] <arup_r> Abhijit: that can be any valid selector
[08:00:52] <Abhijit> ok
[08:01:02] <Abhijit> thanks arup_r and Uhkis
[08:03:36] <Uhkis> any form element*
[08:06:02] <lilalinu_> Actually I need the height of the browser window (without toolbars), no matter how big the actual content is
[08:10:35] <shoky> lilalinu_: top.resizeTo(w,h)  but you can only do it on popup windows, and only if the iframe is from the same origin
[08:22:10] <Mark_____> im not sure if this is relevant chatroom but does anybody know what kind of program it is that establishes some sort of local server so that you can test php or mysql files? what is it called?
[08:22:34] <Xatenev> xampp/mamp/wamp
[08:22:50] <Xatenev> just google local webserver
[08:23:09] <Mark_____> which one is better one though?
[08:23:12] <Mark_____> anything that’s free?
[08:25:07] <Xatenev> all of those are free
[08:25:12] <Xatenev> all of those are basically the same just for different os
[08:25:38] <Mark_____> okay thnaks.
[08:25:39] <Mark_____> Thanks.
[08:29:32] <Pazician> Is there a way to decode these characters that's rendered out from a JS file? The site is UTF-8 but the PHP/JS is wrong... http://puu.sh/nCGQG/ef6e03d8f0.png
[08:49:17] <Abhijit> whats the correct way to append to end of table? as last row. currestry i am doing ("<%= escape_javascript(render partial: 'shared/comment', locals: { pacmnts: @comment } ) %>").appendTo$("#showcommenttable"); and it appends to top of table as if it was first row. how can i make it last row?
[08:56:55] <Shai-Tan> Abhijit, just $('#tableId').append('<tr><td>foot</td></tr>');
[08:57:11] <Abhijit> Shai-Tan, tried that too. same
[08:57:27] <Shai-Tan> sec..
[09:08:02] <decx> does the table have a tbody
[09:10:29] <Abhijit> decx, i gave up. appending to top only. will check later on.
[11:05:42] <MacroMan> When using keydown() to trigger that event, is it possible to set the event info? i.e. set the which and/or keyCode property of the event?
[11:08:28] <decx> trigger has a second argument where you can send event data
[11:10:35] <MacroMan> Ah OK. So use the trigger function instead of keydown(). Thanks. Will read up on it.
[11:21:49] <MacroMan> Is there some kind of security measure preventing a keydown trigger on window?
[11:21:57] <MacroMan> on the window object that is
[11:35:19] <geri> hi decx
[11:38:25] <jphase> MacroMan: no, you can bind to the keydown event on the window object just fine
[11:42:34] <MacroMan> jphase, Thanks. Something else is going wrong. I'll keep checking.
[11:57:37] <all3fox> Hi, ready for some GSoC 16 spam? Basically, I would like to improve jQuery Core tests or Hammer.js tests or solve some jQuery Mobile issues. I have recently had minor PRs accepted to jQuery Core: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commits/master?author=all3fox My problem is that currently I do not have a solid project idea
[12:01:26] <geri> hi decx
[12:01:54] <geri> decx: i wonder how a canvas resize effects stuff drawed on the screen, does it change coordinates?
[12:02:48] <geri> decx: my mouse over item fails when i resize the canvas depending on window.innerWidth + window.innerHeight ...
[12:04:51] <decx> depends if you stretch your canvas dimensions to fit or if you actually change it
[12:05:30] <geri> i took this approach: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/casestudies/gopherwoord-studios-resizing-html5-games/
[12:05:34] <decx> fe you can always render at 400x400 and stretch it out, to whatever, in that case you have to calculate the mouse position relative to the canvas
[12:05:47] <geri> oh relative?
[12:05:53] <decx> or you can resize the canvas on resize, then it shouldnt matter
[12:06:25] <decx> so when you render at 400x400 and display at 800x800 and you move with your mouse over 600,600, then it would actually have to be 300,300
[12:06:47] <decx> but if you resize then canvas then that shouldnt affect you
[12:07:39] <geri> decx: i dynamically resize the canvas... do you refer to that
[12:07:40] <geri> ?
[12:08:33] <decx> so you canvas.width = window.innerWidth on resize or something
[12:08:45] <decx> then it shouldnt matter
[12:09:45] <geri> here is what i do: http://ideone.com/41WwQJ
[12:11:10] <decx> last 4 lines remove style and px
[12:11:18] <decx> just change height and width directly
[12:11:49] <decx> with style it'll stay at the old rendered size and just upscale, probably leading to your coordinate mismatch
[12:12:05] <nitrospectide> Can anyone tell me why this doesn't throw the link path into an alert box? http://jsbin.com/nacesopomu/edit?html,js,output
[12:12:54] <decx> no jquery added to the bin and variables are case sensitive
[12:13:06] <decx> mylink != myLink
[12:14:17] <geri> decx: the radar canvas doesnt resize when i change height and width directly....
[12:15:37] <decx> technically you can leave the radar canvas itself small
[12:15:42] <decx> and just blow it up when you draw it
[12:16:59] <decx> will make the whole thing a bit more performant
[12:17:28] <decx> so instead of just drawImage(rader,0,0) you can use the crop/resize arguments of drawImage: drawImage(radar, 0,0,radar.width,radar.height,0,0,canvas.width,canvas.height)
[12:22:37] <nitrospectide> decx: Doh! My bad. Not sure how I missed that.
[12:25:38] <nitrospectide> So I want to take this code and make the link not actually link, but instead, grab the link path (which it now does since my var name is fixed) and then replace the <a> tag with an <audio> tag using .replaceWith(). How do I trap/discard the normal link action?
[12:26:20] <robertmaxrees> e.preventDefault();
[12:26:27] <decx> if you want to use a link for that just use it as controls too
[12:26:39] <decx> clicking link starts audio, clicking again pauses
[12:26:59] <decx> or just have an audio tag from the start ^^
[12:27:35] <nitrospectide> I want the side content creators to just add a normal link and apply a class, and then the jQuery dresses it all up appropriately.
[12:27:42] <geri> decx: the radar always stays the same size...thats not expected?
[12:28:04] <decx> just always render it at 400x400 and blow it up
[12:28:33] <geri> decx: shouldnt it get larger when i resize the window?
[12:28:52] <decx> well you can still draw it bigger
[12:28:58] <decx> using the drawImage arguments
[12:29:08] <decx> but you dont have to render all that stuff at higher resolutions
[12:29:13] <decx> for juts a background animation
[12:29:26] <decx> a radar being a bit blurry adds to the charme
[12:30:13] <decx> you could even just render the first n frames until it repeats itself and from then on use cached imagedata in a loop
[12:30:20] <decx> but that's advanced stuff
[12:30:26] <geri> yes
[12:30:49] <geri> decx: i used drawImage: outputctx.drawImage(radarcanvas,0,0,radarcanvas.width,radarcanvas.height,0,0,outputcanvas.width,outputcanvas.height);
[12:30:59] <decx> right
[12:31:09] <geri> but it stays the same size all time
[12:31:27] <decx> do you still update radarcanvas.width on resize?
[12:31:33] <geri> yes
[12:31:41] <decx> dont have to
[12:32:05] <decx> just leave it and radarcanvas.height on diameter
[12:32:40] <geri> update paste: http://ideone.com/41WwQJ
[12:33:36] <decx> yeah remove the last 2 lines from resizecanvas
[12:34:00] <decx> radarctx.width in inti does nothing btw
[12:34:11] <decx> only the canvas element itself has dimension properties
[12:34:12] <geri> decx: ok works
[12:34:51] <geri> decx: i draw some moving objects on outputctx...are they expected to resize?
[12:35:17] <decx> no you just add extra pixels to the dimensions
[12:35:29] <decx> it's not expanding uniformly like the universe
[12:35:50] <decx> that's would be the case if you rendered at a fixed resolution and up/downscaled
[12:36:20] <geri> because they radar moves and the object stays at the same pos
[12:37:13] <decx> yeah i'm thinking for a radar like this rendering at a fixed res would be better
[12:37:22] <decx> so you dont have to recalculate all your positions
[12:37:53] <DarioLap> Hi all, If i change class to my element, how i can update selectors "on" click ?
[12:37:57] <geri> decx: what should i change now? :D
[12:38:02] <robertmaxrees> DarioLap you don't.
[12:38:10] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener instead.
[12:38:17] <decx> doesn matter
[12:38:29] <decx> it only binds the events to the elements it finds on load
[12:38:41] <decx> them changing the class that identified them changes nothing
[12:38:49] <decx> it's still an element reference
[12:39:14] <decx> geri: you gotta figure it out, but you're on the right way ^^
[12:41:04] <DarioLap> ok thanks robertmaxrees
[12:50:51] <everson> Heya. I'm trying to perform a .each() iteration with a selector that points to dynamically added elements. So basically the equivalent of $("body").on("click", ".dynamically_added_element", function() ... but for .each() - is this possible?
[12:50:58] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:51:09] <robertmaxrees> are you running the each after the elements have been added?>
[12:51:17] <everson> Yup
[12:51:23] <robertmaxrees> then you're fine.
[12:51:48] <robertmaxrees> unless you're doing something like var $myCollection = $('someSelector'); $myCollection.each();
[12:52:06] <everson> Isn't working for some reason (nope not doing that). Will have a closer look; at least now I know it *should* be working
[12:52:27] <sam___> anyone know if there a way to search and replace using [0-9] and carry over that integer to the replace? maybe with regex?
[12:55:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:58:43] <cannap> what
[12:58:55] <cannap> as exmaple 134248334825842 and you want replace 33
[12:58:56] <everson> robertmaxrees, thanks, found the bug :)
[12:59:38] <robertmaxrees> sam___ are you trying to replace part of a string but retain the number that gets matched?
[13:01:02] <sam___> yes robertmaxrees
[13:01:51] <robertmaxrees> sam___ why not do two replaces?
[13:03:48] <sam___> good point robertmaxrees
[15:08:37] <geri> decx: can you help me with the resize, i guess the best would be to keep the same ration and resize? my goal is to make the mouse selection working again... i created a fiddle... https://jsfiddle.net/98xek7x0/6/
[15:13:43] <decx> geri: i faced a similar problem a few years ago
[15:13:48] <decx> was one of my first fiddles
[15:14:00] <decx> so i should find in in my archive ^^
[15:14:28] <geri> decx: do you see that i try to keep the same ratio?
[15:14:39] <decx> i can see nothing but code salad
[15:14:41] <decx> ^^
[15:15:20] <decx> wait till you see the disgusting code salad i did when i first tried canvas
[15:16:25] <geri> could you lookup the resize hack?
[15:16:34] <decx> found it
[15:16:36] <decx> https://jsfiddle.net/decx/huKnN/
[15:18:14] <decx> curx = (e.pageX - ctxpos.left) * resratio;
[15:27:34] <geri> decx: hm, still fails: https://jsfiddle.net/98xek7x0/8/
[15:28:29] <decx> resratio isnt for the image ratio but the scale ratio from rendered size to displayed size ;)
[15:31:03] <geri> decx: https://jsfiddle.net/98xek7x0/9/ ... looks better?
[15:51:10] <geri> decx: why can you read WIDTH before $(document).ready(function() ?
[15:56:51] <decx> ah see it works somehow
[15:57:11] <decx> and jsfiddle already puts stuff in its own type of document ready
[15:57:53] <decx> ah no it's even just onload by default
[15:57:58] <decx> which is even later than doc ready
[16:05:55] <graphettion> I wish I knew more about databases. I cannot even implement a bootstrap tokenfield tag filtering system.
[16:06:11] <graphettion> </venting>
[16:08:13] <Excedrin> databases are just like other bases but instead of providing a stable platform for something, or a centralized location for field operations, they provide a collection of facts and sometimes anecdotes
[16:08:23] <Excedrin> </surrealism>
[16:13:47] <graphettion> Aren't there political databases?
[16:13:52] <graphettion> </sarcasm>
[16:14:21] <graphettion> I'm sure the FOX News database is filled with facts.
[16:19:14] <Excedrin> that's basically conservapedia?
[16:20:02] <graphettion> Yup, where facts are warped.
[16:26:35] <decx> facts dont have an agenda, but you can use cleverly misrepresent statistics to prove anything
[16:30:17] <nitrospectide> I'm using a simple script here to replace this linked word "audio" with an <audio> tag, but for some reason it's loading up and playing two copies (though only one shows in the Chrome inspector). Can anyone tell me why?
[16:30:20] <nitrospectide> http://sspinnovations.com/test-0
[16:36:18] <geri> re
[16:36:28] <graphettion> decx: true, it's how they are used
[16:36:38] <nitrospectide> This is the html + jQuery, though it behaves strangely in a different way here - replacing the whole thing with the mp3: http://jsbin.com/nacesopomu/edit?html,js,output
[16:37:03] <geri> decx: so calling $('#myCanvas').width(); before $(document).ready(function()  is wrong?
[16:37:53] <decx> geri: you dont need ready at all if your javascript is at the end of body
[16:39:05] <geri> decx: i did a var WIDTH = $('#myCanvas').attr('width'); in the global...
[16:59:51] <nitrospectide> How is it even possible that two MP3s seem to load and play, but only one shows in the page source?
[17:01:27] <decx> audio doesnt have to come from the markup
[17:02:43] <decx> and it only loads once for me
[17:03:36] <graphettion> Has anyone used bootstrap tokenfield to filter data?
[17:13:10] <nitrospectide> docx: Hmm. I'm on OSX, and in both Chrome and Firefox, it starts playing two copies simultaneously with a slight time offset. (I'm referring to the original link, not the jsbin link, which just loads one, but for some reason replaces the whole page)
[17:15:22] <nitrospectide> decx: Did it only play one copy when you tried it here? http://sspinnovations.com/test-0
[17:16:03] <gkwhc> Hi, does jquery have a function that checks all descendants? basically i have a form with many divs, and in the divs inputs etc. I'd like to check if none of them have the attribute "invalid"
[17:19:35] <decx> nitrospectide: it did play twice on the site, weird
[17:20:47] <decx> there is no invalid attribute gkwhc
[17:20:58] <nitrospectide> decx: Is there anything goofy about my code? The jsbin doesn't seem to work properly, because it doesn't replace the link inline with the MP3. It just replaces the whole page (whne I try it, at least)
[17:21:18] <decx> no idea where stuff is
[17:21:32] <decx> site-scripts?
[17:22:08] <decx> it doesnt replace the whole page for me
[17:22:12] <decx> but it does paly twice
[17:22:21] <gkwhc> decx: it is set by the library im using. (form data is valid or invalid)
[17:22:50] <nitrospectide> decx: It replaces the whole page in the jsbin. it plays twice on the actual site.
[17:23:15] <nitrospectide> My point being - I'm not sure hte jsbin is a valid test, since it seems to fail, only differently
[17:23:27] <decx> well now it plays twice in jsbin for me
[17:23:32] <decx> but it doesnt replace the whole page
[17:24:40] <nitrospectide> decx: Now I'm completely baffled. Is there somethign weird in my script causing recursion or something?
[17:26:09] <decx> no idea but when i redo it it works
[17:26:14] <decx> does jsbin autosave?
[17:26:18] <decx> how does that work
[17:33:15] <nitrospectide> decx: I don't know. I just tested the page on my site, and it works properly in IE. Go figure.
[17:33:29] <decx> well i changed the big
[17:33:32] <decx> try it like that maybe
[17:33:39] <decx> the bin*
[17:34:00] <decx> maybe insertafter having a hickup because of autoplay
[17:37:09] <nitrospectide> decx: What did you change? I don't see a difference.
[17:38:05] <decx> http://jsbin.com/xewuvitisa/edit?html,js,output
[17:40:45] <nitrospectide> decx: Writing it that way seems to work. Weird. What is this for? $(this).after(audio).remove();
[17:41:29] <decx> just a weird way to do replacewith
[17:43:41] <nitrospectide> Took me a moment. I see that now. I wonder if replaceWith is the issue?
[17:57:56] <nitrospectide> decx: Thank you for the assistance. That had me totally stumped.
[19:37:51] <jak2000> not know if is the right place,  but.... how to work with the canvas? i want draw a square(small square) over an image, how do that?
[19:50:18] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/m8xk0apx/  <-- how 'detect' the click on the small square, and drag it (and show the final x,y) position
[20:07:28] <decx> keep track of the mouse position and redraw on mousemove
[20:08:04] <jak2000> yes i want do this
[20:08:09] <supsup> how do you chian ajax calls with promises without getting pyramid of doom, if the ajax calls have to be made in order, because the first call contains data to even make the 2nd call? etc
[20:08:21] <jak2000> but first need dectect the click on the rectangle
[20:08:48] <decx> you know that
[20:08:59] <supsup> is there a pattern for that?
[20:09:00] <decx> you know where you rectangle is how big it is and where the click is
[20:23:51] <jak2000> decx yes
[20:24:02] <jak2000> in this case: context.rect(100, 50, 10, 10);
[20:24:07] <jak2000> wich is the nex step?
[20:31:38] <decx> well that's just drawing
[20:31:44] <decx> you separate those things
[20:32:01] <decx> have data with your rects and keep track of the mouseposition in an object
[20:32:09] <decx> and run those against each other
[21:20:04] <jak2000> decx are you there?
[21:20:18] <decx> yes i played around with it
[21:20:26] <jak2000> have a fiddle?
[21:20:35] <decx> literally just hit save on that as you wrote
[21:20:49] <decx> got a bit out of hand tho

[21:27:21] <jak2000> yes
[21:27:22] <jak2000> done
[21:27:24] <jak2000> see the third?
[21:27:38] <decx> alert is not console
[21:30:00] <jak2000> alert("Position x:"+mouse.x+", position y: "+mouse.y);
[21:30:04] <jak2000> is the correct right?

[22:27:07] <easyOnMe> I have some issues with drag and drop
[22:27:49] <easyOnMe> firstly I have three droppables and I wanted to count the number of items dropped on each droppable
[22:28:57] <easyOnMe> I also wanted to update the count by subtracting if a customer decides to shift a dropped item into another droppable so basically I have just adding when something is dropped and subtracting when an item is shifted
[22:29:03] <easyOnMe> now this is my question
[22:30:00] <easyOnMe> I have a problem when an item happens to be dragged and passes through a droppable and it subtracts on that the number of items on the droppable even though nothing was dropped and shifted from that droppable
