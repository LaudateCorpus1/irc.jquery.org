[01:58:33] <Eckyecky> Can anyone have a look at this problem? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27148450/trying-to-use-croppic-net-and-make-it-a-dropzone-can-anyone-figure-this-out
[02:09:04] <Cork> Eckyecky: if you have a question ask it, don't try to recruit users for SO
[02:09:34] <Cork> or patiently wait for someone on SO to answer your question
[02:09:45] <Eckyecky> what's so?
[02:10:09] <Cork> StackOverflow
[02:10:12] <Eckyecky> Well my question is, how to feed a dropped image to an upload form field?
[02:10:32] <Cork> is the form meant to be submitted over ajax?
[02:14:18] <Nindustries> Hi, I'm doing an AJAX request with modified headers to my web backend. In firefox this works fine, but I get an Unauthorized in Chrome. Anyone ever experienced this before?   http://pastebin.com/QuwzBx0G
[02:15:10] <Cork> Nindustries: is it line 4 or 6 that complain?
[02:15:48] <Nindustries> Nothing complains, I just get a 401 in my console and "getData error failed : http://d00med.net/quackr/secured/categories, [object Object], error, Unauthorized"
[02:15:59] <Nindustries> Well, you could call that a complaint
[02:16:06] <FilipNortic> Nindustries: your request seems to be async: false as well
[02:16:24] <Nindustries> yes
[02:16:31] <Cork> not the cause of the problem, but yes that is a bad idea
[02:16:47] <Nindustries> I want some stuff to continue only when the data is returned
[02:16:52] <Nindustries> (is for a webapp)
[02:17:00] <Cork> Nindustries: as far as i know authentication doesn't have a bearer mode
[02:17:16] <Cork> Nindustries: you will freeze the browser if the user get a network drop
[02:17:25] <Cork> build your page to handle the async ajax call instead
[02:17:29] <FilipNortic> cross domain, async false is a bad combo
[02:17:32] <Cork> will result in much better user experience
[02:17:42] <Cork> async is always bad; period
[02:17:45] <Cork> opps
[02:17:50] <Cork> meant sync
[02:18:10] <Nindustries> Ok, i'll fix that when I get out of this issue
[02:18:34] <Cork> ah oath adds the bearer mode
[02:18:48] <Nindustries> Oh yes, sorry
[02:18:57] <Nindustries> oauth is awesome
[02:19:38] <Cork> Nindustries: is the tocken encoded as it should be?
[02:19:52] <Cork> also have you verified that you actually send the correct string in chrome?
[02:19:59] <Nindustries> I suppose it should be, as it works in firefox and has worked under chrome before
[02:20:08] <Cork> never assume
[02:20:10] <Cork> verify
[02:20:27] <Cork> console.log in the ajax call
[02:20:31] <Cork> so you see what data you send
[02:20:45] <Cork> also open the web console and check what data you send over the network stack
[02:21:05] <Cork> and finally you might want to compare firefox to chrome
[02:21:14] <Cork> and then you can see what differs => fails
[02:23:18] <Nindustries> I see, OK
[02:23:21] <Nindustries> Thanks!
[03:56:47] <DevAntoine> hi
[03:57:42] <DevAntoine> I've got an issue with .html(): I'm getting some html containing special tags such as <%= foo %>. They are used for templating purpose. The thing is, .html() html encodes those special tags, ruining the templating engine. Any clue about how to avoid that?
[03:58:14] <Cork> DevAntoine: you can't give the template to .html
[03:58:21] <Cork> you have to keep the template as text
[03:58:44] <Cork> and first after running the template engine on it can you give it to .html
[03:59:46] <DevAntoine> Cork: but I need to update some input's properties before passing it to the template, hence the .html()
[03:59:55] <Cork> DevAntoine: you can't do it
[04:00:10] <Cork> .html will try to parse the template as html
[04:00:18] <Cork> but before the engine has ran over it, you don't have html
[04:01:21] <Cork> DevAntoine: best option is to either put template code for the value in the input
[04:01:29] <Cork> and have the template engine update the value
[04:01:43] <Cork> or run the input modification on the other end of the template engine
[04:03:42] <DevAntoine> Cork: erf, I don't like that option :/
[04:03:55] <DevAntoine> because it means I'll have to re run my code each time the template engine is fired
[04:04:00] <Cork> DevAntoine: only other option is to drop the use of the template
[04:04:07] <DevAntoine> but the template edit is done once, max twice
[04:04:52] <Cork> DevAntoine: basically if you try to handle the template as html, all none dom <> content will be dropped by the dom parser
[04:05:06] <Cork> meaning all template code will be lost
[04:06:36] <DevAntoine> Cork: well, I can place with regex I guess :/
[04:06:54] <Cork> DevAntoine: what template engine are you using?
[04:07:08] <Cork> check if you can have it do the value managing
[04:07:16] <Cork> many can
[04:07:46] <DevAntoine> Cork: http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/
[04:08:09] <Cork> ah
[04:08:14] <Cork> that is very restrictive
[04:08:24] <Cork> ya, you won't be able to do it with that
[04:10:23] <DevAntoine> Cork: yeah, I needed the simplest templating engine ever to only replace a few variables
[04:10:32] <Cork> ya
[04:11:04] <Cork> regexp it is then i guess
[04:11:07] <Erwat> may i interject with offtopic? i just have a NEED to share, i noticed this today: http://i.imgur.com/FV4LkW0.png they look like the character PI
[04:13:44] <DevAntoine> Erwat: was is it?
[04:13:47] <DevAntoine> Cork: thanks anyway
[04:14:07] <Erwat> DevAntoine: tt and jt in capital case
[04:14:24] <Erwat> they look like the greek character for pi
[04:41:58] <baako> afternoon guys. I am using ajax post to sent some data to my php page which then results it to a div with the id of "popup"  http://pastebin.com/M6jXpbp8
[04:42:35] <baako> unfortunately it doesn't get display
[04:43:01] <baako> http://pastebin.com/kckkKynR
[04:43:18] <baako> what I am i doing wrong please. Thank you
[04:48:37] <rosieres> I'm trying to have a click function on items which come from an array. I doing a bind seperately but I only get a catch on one item. What am I doing wrong? -> http://jsfiddle.net/4snh4jzr/1/
[04:49:48] <FilipNortic> baako: you seem to havew an extra }); in your paste
[04:50:53] <baako> FilipNortic: sorry i didnt copy jQuery(document).ready(function($) { ass well
[04:50:56] <baako> as well
[04:54:08] <FilipNortic> baako: are u sure you return valid html from the server?
[04:54:29] <Cork> rosieres: you can replace that concat madness with ctoel.children('h1:first,h2:first,h3:first').text()
[04:54:33] <baako> FilipNortic: looks like the issue is with my php
[04:54:36] <Cork> makes for much cleaner code
[04:55:34] <Cork> rosieres: also delegate the click event to a static parent instead of biding events in a loop
[04:58:56] <Cork> rosieres: http://jsfiddle.net/4snh4jzr/2/
[05:11:27] <jayadeep_> Please help. JqueryUI slider. The corresponding template is https://dpaste.de/8qFz#L20,30 . But the 'rating' slider would not show up in the page.
[05:15:54] <DevAntoine> Cork: innerHtml will have the same behavior as .html()?
[05:16:03] <Cork> yes
[05:16:22] <Cork> DevAntoine: as soon as you try to convert it to dom
[05:16:27] <Cork> no matter how you do it
[05:16:46] <DevAntoine> Cork: cause it seems a little bit complicated with regex, but I don't see other option
[05:17:05] <Cork> DevAntoine: you could technically replace <% %> with an html compatible marker instead
[05:17:08] <Cork> and use that
[05:17:24] <Cork> then you might be able to get around it
[05:17:32] <DevAntoine> Cork: what do you suggest?
[05:17:46] <rosieres> Cork: Perfect. Thank you.
[05:17:48] <Cork> not really a suggestion but you could try something like ${} for example
[05:17:58] <Cork> instead of <%%>
[05:26:19] <d0de> What's a good, small, modern javascript library? I'm writing my first library and it would be really helpful to have a model to follow for how to structure things. For example, I'm unsure how much it's acceptabl to have in the global scope, etc
[05:26:54] <Cork> d0de: simple you should only ever have public api in the global scope
[05:27:16] <Cork> preferably namespaced (not one name for each function but under a name for your lib)
[05:27:33] <Cork> every thing else should be scoped off to be local to your lib
[05:27:59] <d0de> Ok, so basically create an object with a name that's my library, and every public function is a method of the object?
[05:29:04] <DevAntoine> Cork: I'm having such a hard time editing john resig templating engine to adapt it to {{ }} (yes, I took mustache as an example)
[05:29:09] <DevAntoine> ::D
[05:35:43] <d0de> I'm looking at a library where everything is wrapped in: ` ;(function() { // the lib }) (); ` what does that do / mean?
[05:37:28] <nights> hi
[05:38:00] <nights> cant seem to get :focus to work
[05:38:13] <nights> if($("#input_field").is(":focus")){
[05:39:10] <thyphus> if($("#input_field:focus"))?
[05:39:48] <nights> thyphus: i have another keylistener on the document
[05:39:57] <nights> and i want to use that in all cases except when that input has focus
[05:40:16] <nights> however, when i load the page, and nothing is still selected, then it seems that #input_field:focus is true
[05:41:15] <thyphus> ok
[05:43:36] <d0de> nights, can you do a fiddle? Have you checked to see that the input isn't actually focussed?
[05:46:44] <d0de> http://jsfiddle.net/mkrtnoxo/ seems to work ok
[05:46:48] <nights> d0de: i can see that theres no text cursor in it
[05:47:03] <nights> i mean no blinking I
[05:47:29] <nights> isnt that the definition of a input in focus?
[05:47:38] <nights> that you can type in it?
[05:47:51] <nights> i can try to blur it on document ready
[05:48:01] <DevAntoine> Cork: my understanding of this code: http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/ is that the template is cached (I'm having a hard time reading it), so if I change the template's html, it won't have any effect right?
[05:49:09] <nights> i got it working!
[05:49:10] <nights> nm
[05:49:12] <nights> thanks
[05:50:11] <Cork> DevAntoine: it creates a function (new Function("obj"
[05:50:20] <Cork> DevAntoine: and this function is stored in the cache variable
[05:51:06] <Cork> DevAntoine: and as the regexp modified "str" variable is merged into the content of this generated function
[05:51:12] <Cork> you get a cache of the content
[05:53:42] <winegoddess> I'm trying to find out if there are best practices regarding setting up a lot of functions in document.ready. other than cluttering up a file, is there an issue if you have too many calls there?
[05:54:23] <DevAntoine> Cork: ok, thanks
[05:54:31] <DevAntoine> it's sad but I had to dump the cache system
[05:59:32] <DevAntoine> Cork: the anonymous function stored in the print var is never used right?
[06:00:18] <Diegao> hi, is there a better and optimized way to write this kind of code? http://pastebin.com/yv5mdrQN
[06:00:39] <Cork> DevAntoine: uh
[06:00:52] <Cork> it is part of the function created for handling the template
[06:01:23] <Cork> but yes, it looks like it isn't ever used
[06:01:39] <Cork> most likely left over debug code or something like that
[06:01:43] <DevAntoine> Cork: it's weird from resig right?
[06:01:54] <Cork> resig?
[06:02:16] <DevAntoine> Cork: well, knowing who wrote it it's weird that there's some unused code in it
[06:02:48] <Cork> can't say i'm that impressed with any of it to be honest
[06:03:07] <DevAntoine> Cork: talking about the templating engine? Why?
[06:03:30] <Cork> DevAntoine: it will consume quite a bit of memory cause it generates a new code blob for every template
[06:04:03] <DevAntoine> Cork: I don't understand -_-' code blob?
[06:04:13] <Cork> the string it gives to new Function
[06:04:28] <Cork> both the string and the jited code will be kept in memory
[06:04:40] <Cork> meaning it consumes quite a bit of ram
[06:05:26] <Cork> ontop of that i have serious irks every time i see new Function/eval (basically the same thing) in code
[06:11:07] <DevAntoine> Cork: it's used here to cache it right?
[06:12:39] <Diegao> hi, is there a better and optimized way to write this kind of code? http://pastebin.com/yv5mdrQN
[06:13:51] <bbclover> Hey guys, sanity test... don't know why this isn't working: http://jsfiddle.net/Yottabyte/cc4cpe1d/
[06:14:38] <bengalo> bbclover no library selected
[06:15:01] <bbclover> haha right
[06:15:03] <bbclover> thabjs
[06:15:05] <bbclover> thanks**
[06:15:11] <bbclover> so early... and I'm sick :*
[06:15:12] <bbclover> :(
[06:18:36] <Cork> DevAntoine: well no not really
[06:18:50] <Cork> DevAntoine: it could be done other ways to have it cache too
[06:19:07] <DevAntoine> Cork: and I thought I new javascript!
[06:19:10] <Cork> it is just how him/they choosed to implement it
[06:19:27] <Cork> DevAntoine: noone knows javascript ;)
[06:19:37] <Cork> some THINK they do, but noone does ;P
[06:19:51] <Cork> j/k
[06:20:16] <Cork> but ya, especially if you start to mix es4x and es6/7 into the mix
[06:20:26] <Cork> it start to be really hard to keep track of it all
[06:20:28] <DevAntoine> :D
[06:21:00] <mooncup> 15:19 < DevAntoine> Cork: and I thought I new javascript!
[06:21:02] <mooncup> >new
[06:21:05] <mooncup> I see what you did there!
[06:21:58] <Cork> :)
[06:22:45] <Diegao> hi, is there a better and optimized way to write this kind of code? http://pastebin.com/yv5mdrQN
[06:25:51] <DevAntoine> mooncup: oups :D
[06:27:49] <FilipNortic> Diegao: what is it you want to improve mainly speed or code structure?
[06:29:10] <Diegao> FilipNortic: both, is it possible?
[06:31:19] <decx> generally, dont append in a loop
[06:31:51] <decx> create your structure in a fragment and when it's done you can append to the dom
[06:32:15] <Diegao> because dom changing is slow?
[06:32:27] <decx> yes
[06:33:03] <Diegao> so, I would loop over the html structure, then after I would append it
[06:33:15] <Diegao> after the loop
[06:33:23] <decx> right
[06:33:56] <Diegao> thanks
[06:36:38] <Diegao> decx: any suggestion on this snippet: http://pastebin.com/W9VsZKLP I'm always confused to improve this when I face it
[06:37:28] <decx> combine css and chain the methods
[06:37:37] <decx> right now you look up the same thing 4 times
[06:37:57] <mbrzuzy> You can also pass an object to CSS instead, $().css({'attribute': 'value', 'attribute2':'value2'})
[06:38:21] <mbrzuzy> and then you can chain the click as well
[06:38:21] <decx> unless you have dynamic changes in your css just put it in a class and add that
[06:38:42] <Cork> decx++
[06:39:19] <Diegao> hmm
[06:39:52] <Diegao> decx: would be like this http://pastebin.com/reA9MbCD
[06:39:59] <Diegao> following your suggestions
[06:41:00] <winegoddess> hello - i keep seeing Query a subset of the DOM when using complex selectors drastically improves performance referenced on many best practice sites, but don't understand. #1 here http://kiagsmedia.com/2013/09/25/tips-tricks-for-jquery-programmers/
[06:41:21] <winegoddess> what does the subset do?
[06:41:31] <decx> right, you can also chain $(this) Diegao
[06:41:54] <decx> and dont forget the closing elipsis
[06:42:04] <decx> your click method isnt closed
[06:44:30] <Diegao> decx: like this: http://pastebin.com/eSZqwhLe ?
[06:45:03] <decx> the other way around ^^
[06:45:25] <decx> and add a class instead of inline styles
[06:45:48] <Diegao> yes
[06:46:37] <Diegao> decx: so, the key part here is to avoid looking up to the same elements several times when you can chain them..
[06:46:56] <decx> you can also prevent lookups by caching
[06:47:12] <Diegao> hmm
[06:47:22] <Diegao> how would I do that?
[06:47:38] <decx> ie var foo = $('.foo'); now you can foo.method() to your hearts content without extra lookups
[06:48:57] <Diegao> decx: this way I could do in separated lines that I wouldn't have that look up problem?
[06:49:31] <Diegao> accessing the variable that i instantiated
[06:49:56] <decx> well you can still chain
[06:50:00] <decx> but yes
[06:50:24] <Diegao> thats good to know :D
[06:55:10] <abailarri> Hello. There is a way to clear a file input with jquery?
[06:57:18] <DevAntoine> abailarri: myInput.val('') ???
[06:58:06] <abailarri> DevAntoine, not works with file input
[06:58:27] <DevAntoine> abailarri: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1043957/clearing-input-type-file-using-jquery
[06:59:30] <abailarri> I see the solution, but is not for me
[07:00:32] <DevAntoine> abailarri: well, it seems it's the only possible way of doing it
[07:00:39] <DevAntoine> abailarri: why it's not for you?
[07:04:24] <abailarri> DevAntoine, but the jsfiddle of your link now works
[07:28:04] <DevAntoine> is it possible to stop the event propagation and then continue it?
[07:31:52] <FilipNortic> DevAntoine: Why would you need to?
[07:32:46] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: The only thing that comes to mind for me is triggering the event on the element above where you want it to stop.
[07:32:51] <NoiseEee> DevAntoine: remember its single threaded - you can "do stuff" before it has a chance to propogate
[07:33:47] <BillCriswell> e.stopPropogation(); $(this).closest('.element-to-resume').trigger(e.type); or some shit.
[07:33:56] <BillCriswell> but this feels fiskhy.
[07:33:59] <BillCriswell> fishy.
[07:34:16] <Fishy> BillCriswell: billcriswell.
[07:34:25] <BillCriswell> Dangit.
[07:34:30] <BillCriswell> I've done this before haven't I?
[07:34:35] <BillCriswell> BRB.
[07:34:35] <Fishy> yes
[07:34:42] <BillCriswell> Sorry haha
[07:35:08] <Fishy> Its okay... Happens more then you would think
[07:49:22] <DevAntoine> BillCriswell, NoiseEee, FilipNortic: well, I have some selects which have a confirm dialog opping when their value changes, just to be sure to change their values. Inside those select I have another select having a change event too. If the select value doesn't change I don't want the other select's change event to be triggered
[07:50:30] <NoiseEee> DevAntoine: so the issue is stop everything and then explicitly call handlers/functions according to your logic/rules etc
[07:50:43] <NoiseEee> but call the functions, don't trigger fake user events
[07:50:48] <DevAntoine> NoiseEee: yep
[07:51:04] <DevAntoine> but it feels really bad to manually call them after
[07:51:13] <NoiseEee> DevAntoine: nah think of them as validation
[07:51:22] <NoiseEee> just break it out into a specific validation function maybe etc
[07:52:32] <DevAntoine> NoiseEee: it's already wrapped in a function cause I need it to be applyied when the page is loaded for the edit view (and it's the time I think my code is totaly unmaintainable and a framework to bind my view to my models like angular or knockout would have been awesome)
[08:00:24] <NoiseEee> word
[08:06:22] <gremlyn> not sure if should be here or #javascript? but I'm having a scoping issue with $.post(): https://gist.github.com/Gremlyn/b96d7d12548fbce031aa
[08:07:05] <gremlyn> var set prior to the use of $.post() needs to be updated inside it, but it doesn't update in the global sense
[08:11:55] <shoky> gremlyn: ajax is asynchronous, the $.post callback function is called AFTER that snippet that follows the $.post().  it'll work if you move it inside the post callback
[08:12:32] <shoky> so it's not a scoping issue, it's a timing issue
[08:13:52] <gremlyn> doh, shoky thanks
[08:13:57] <gremlyn> I always seem to forget abiout that timing
[08:18:17] <Omar-> is it possible to extend a widget's anonymous function, e.g. _create?
[08:18:43] <Omar-> for example, this widget https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/listview.js
[08:19:11] <Omar-> ?tell Omar- testing
[08:19:11] <b-ot> Omar-: testing
[08:24:30] <shoky> Omar-: you can change it directly: $.mobile.listview.prototype._create  or you can extend the widget and override it there
[08:33:56] <Omar-> shoky thanks, I'll try it, although it looks like a difficult job
[08:34:05] <Omar-> I would rather create a separate widget/plugin
[08:35:43] <shoky> Omar-: you can do that (though you'd have to manually initialize the widget instances i think).  this shows how  http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/widget-factory/extending-widgets/
[08:36:52] <shoky> e.g.:    $.widget('my.listview', $.mobile.listview, { _create: function() { console.log('my extended listview!');  return this._superApply(arguments); } };
[08:37:45] <Omar-> shoky true, the plugin should be manually initalized if not extended I assume
[08:38:36] <Omar-> this plugin initializes itself when jQM is initialized
[08:38:52] <Omar-> i'm trying to go through the code to know how it auto-init itself
[08:38:53] <Omar-> https://github.com/jtsage/jquery-mobile-spinbox/blob/master/js/jqm-spinbox.js
[08:39:13] <jlmitch5dev> hey I've got a reference to a string of an html element and I need to access that element.  What's the best way to do that?
[08:39:51] <robertmaxrees> jlmitch5dev huh?
[08:40:00] <Omar-> lol
[08:40:01] <jlmitch5dev> by "ref to a string" I mean I literally can console.log `<a href="blahshf...>`
[08:40:02] <robertmaxrees> jlmitch5dev you mean as a jquery object?
[08:40:06] <shoky> Omar-: it probably has to do with that option it uses:     initSelector: "input[data-role='spinbox']",
[08:40:13] <robertmaxrees> $(yourString);
[08:40:27] <Omar-> shoky true
[08:40:56] <jlmitch5dev> I didn't think I could select via the whole element, lemme try that
[08:41:05] <robertmaxrees> jlmitch5dev you're not selecting anything via the element.
[08:41:33] <robertmaxrees> jlmitch5dev some clarification would be helpful.
[08:42:33] <jlmitch5dev> robertmaxrees okay give me a sec
[08:43:06] <plambwk-> oh jquery masters
[08:43:28] <plambwk-> can you tell me why the youtube modal after you click "See the video" works here
[08:43:30] <plambwk-> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7155646/scaleout_homepage_video.html
[08:43:36] <plambwk-> but not here
[08:43:37] <plambwk-> http://www.scaleoutsoftware.com/
[08:43:58] <robertmaxrees> plambwk- your second link has js errors that are likely causing your problems.
[08:43:59] <robertmaxrees> fix those.
[08:44:31] <plambwk-> http://www.scaleoutsoftware.com/templates/static/script/js/jquery-1.10.2.min.map 404 (Not Found)
[08:44:33] <plambwk-> oh
[08:44:37] <plambwk-> that could be a problem
[08:44:41] <robertmaxrees> plambwk- not that...
[08:44:44] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[08:44:59] <robertmaxrees> prettyPhoto and superFish aren't functions.  sounds like you're not loading some plugins
[08:45:17] <plambwk-> those are weird deprecated things that have been there since before i inherited this
[08:45:32] <plambwk-> could those mess with the youtubepopup.js
[08:45:32] <plambwk-> ?
[08:45:34] <robertmaxrees> javascript errors like that can prevent other code from working.  start by fixing those.
[08:47:04] <plambwk-> hah
[08:47:11] <plambwk-> removing the superfish script seemed to fixed it
[08:47:23] <robertmaxrees> always remove js errors.
[08:47:25] <plambwk-> ty
[08:47:36] <jlmitch5dev> hey robertmaxrees you were correct.  Apparently you can select an element in jQuery with $("<a>...") just like you would with an id or a class
[08:47:48] <robertmaxrees> jlmitch5dev that's not selecting anything.
[08:48:01] <robertmaxrees> jlmitch5dev that's just creating a fragment for you to work with.
[08:48:21] <robertmaxrees> if you need to actually select an element in the document, that's a different concept.
[08:50:42] <plambwk-> robertmaxrees do you like how i have no test environment
[08:50:44] <jlmitch5dev> $("#foo") allows you to interact with the DOM element with ID foo.  That is what I mean by "select" that might not be the right terminology, but it does that
[08:50:49] <plambwk-> and i just edit the html/css files on prod
[08:51:08] <robertmaxrees> jlmitch5dev passing an html string to the jquery function creates a fragment for you to manipulate.
[08:51:12] <plambwk-> that shit gets my heart racing
[08:51:23] <robertmaxrees> plambwk- O.o
[08:51:28] <robertmaxrees> i'd change that process quick.
[08:51:31] <plambwk-> haha
[08:51:51] <robertmaxrees> jlmitch5dev creating a new fragment lets you interact with that like any other jq object.
[08:52:02] <robertmaxrees> plambwk- you laugh, but some day you're going to hose prod and regret it ;)
[08:52:16] <jlmitch5dev> okay, that's fine, it does what I need it to do.
[08:55:57] <plambwk-> robertmaxrees: ya i hosed what you just looked at for a period of about 5 minutes
[08:56:08] <robertmaxrees> that's why you don't edit production ;)
[08:56:11] <plambwk-> so whoever hit our site in that time frame saw some weird stuff
[08:56:55] <robertmaxrees> and if you have no other option, just copy the page and edit the copy instead.
[09:06:56] <wodim> how do i determine if a selector lead to no results?
[09:07:09] <wodim> according to the console the result is [], but selector == [] returns false?
[09:07:10] <robertmaxrees> .length
[09:07:20] <robertmaxrees> if the length is 0, no results.
[09:07:27] <wodim> ok
[09:07:29] <wodim> thanks
[09:47:39] <floatmastaflex> yo. why does the following code's selector end up firing on every single element in the page? viewsWrapper.on("mouseover", $(singleMovieContainer).children(), function(e) {....
[09:48:29] <decx> the second argument of on takes a string not a collection
[09:49:08] <floatmastaflex> how do I turn the collection into a string?
[09:49:24] <robertmaxrees> it need to be a selector.
[09:49:56] <BillCriswell> .movie > * ?
[09:50:04] <BillCriswell> Something feels funky though.
[09:50:05] <robertmaxrees> you don't convert the collection into a string - just use the selector you originally had.
[09:51:55] <floatmastaflex> robertmaxrees I need to include all of the child elements of singleMovieContainer in the on() event
[09:52:13] <robertmaxrees> then you need to come up with a css selector for that.
[09:52:24] <robertmaxrees> .parent > * is one way to do that.
[09:52:30] <robertmaxrees> but you can't use a jquery collection to do that.
[09:53:22] <robertmaxrees> otherwise use a directly bound listener.
[09:53:37] <floatmastaflex> so if singleMovieContainer = ".container", my selector would be .container > *?
[09:53:58] <robertmaxrees> err, no...
[09:54:07] <robertmaxrees> well, it could be. can you provide an example of your markup?
[09:55:28] <robertmaxrees> because something seems strange here,
[09:55:41] <BillCriswell> Vedy strange.
[09:55:51] <robertmaxrees> eddie veddy-strange
[09:56:48] <floatmastaflex> robertmaxrees http://pastebin.com/jfXVe1T7
[09:58:53] <robertmaxrees> $('.movie-list').on('mouseover', '.single-movie', function() {});
[09:58:56] <robertmaxrees> this is what you want.
[09:59:05] <floatmastaflex> I basically want to make it so that on mouseover "single-movie" or any of its decendents, I add an active class to "single-movie"
[09:59:14] <floatmastaflex> that sorta works
[09:59:18] <robertmaxrees> right, so you just use it on single-movie
[09:59:44] <floatmastaflex> but when i hover on any of the contained elements, the active class goes away
[09:59:54] <robertmaxrees> then you have other issues.
[09:59:55] <floatmastaflex> (I have a mouseout)
[10:00:23] <BillCriswell> floatmastaflex: Is this hover just for aesthetic reasons?
[10:00:33] <floatmastaflex> of course
[10:00:44] <BillCriswell> Just use .single-movie:hover {}
[10:00:48] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:00:55] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you probably want mouseenter instead.
[10:02:04] <floatmastaflex> BillCriswell the event doesn't exist in the dom initially (I load it in with ajax)
[10:02:17] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't matter with css.
[10:02:17] <BillCriswell> floatmastaflex: Doesn't matter with CSS.
[10:02:29] <BillCriswell> JINX
[10:02:31] <robertmaxrees> hahaha BillCriswell++
[10:02:42] <BillCriswell> 123 you owe me a coke.
[10:02:54] <robertmaxrees> too bad i'm never going to phlly, JERK
[10:04:21] <floatmastaflex> BillCriswell / robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/nRms1vgt
[10:04:37] <robertmaxrees> fiddle it duder
[10:05:03] <floatmastaflex> just look at the pastebin. it should be obvious by looking at it
[10:05:10] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:05:21] <robertmaxrees> whatevs
[10:05:34] <robertmaxrees> dunno what singleMovieContainer is supposed to be, same with viewsWrapper.
[10:05:40] <robertmaxrees> but yeah it's totally obvious ;)
[10:05:48] <floatmastaflex> viewswrapper is a container div
[10:05:59] <floatmastaflex> singlemoviecontainer = .single-movie
[10:06:05] <robertmaxrees> why can't use you use the CSS we talked about?
[10:06:31] <BillCriswell> floatmastaflex: http://jsbin.com/botewujihe/1/edit?html,css,output
[10:06:41] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell nah man just look at the pastebin ;)
[10:06:47] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/botewujihe/1/edit?html,css,output *
[10:08:35] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/botewujihe/2/edit?html,css,js,output there you go floatmastaflex, with dynamically generated elements.
[10:08:35] <floatmastaflex> wow i totally forgot about :hover
[10:08:37] <floatmastaflex> thanks for that
[10:08:49] <BillCriswell> ok.
[10:08:51] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[10:09:13] <floatmastaflex> also, sorry for being snippy. this week is a shitshow already
[10:09:20] <robertmaxrees> it's all good mano.
[10:09:31] <BillCriswell> Happens to everyone.
[10:30:54] <hlvwrk> Sup duders? Anyone able to help me figure out how to use a specific plugin? The docs are only semi helpful. :(.
[10:30:59] <hlvwrk> https://github.com/benmajor/jQuery-Touch-Events
[10:31:03] <robertmaxrees> !asl @ hlvwrk
[10:31:05] <hlvwrk> lol
[10:31:06] <robertmaxrees> err.
[10:31:09] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ hlvwrk
[10:31:10] <b-ot> hlvwrk: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:31:11] <hlvwrk> american sign language? :o
[10:31:13] <robertmaxrees> not my day
[10:31:19] <hlvwrk> Not mine either apparently.
[10:32:16] <hlvwrk> Alright, so. This plugin basically gives us the jq mobile events (Touch/Swipe/etc.) How exactly would I capture the 'direction' when firing off an event on swipe?
[10:32:39] <hlvwrk> It's in the callback data, but I don't know how to actually access that.
[10:33:54] <robertmaxrees> $(element).swipe(function(e, direction) { console.log(direction) });
[10:33:59] <robertmaxrees> something like that i'm guessing
[10:34:09] <hlvwrk> Lemme try that!
[10:36:07] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, setup a fiddle ;)
[10:36:41] <hlvwrk> so... I'm trying:       $(element).swipe(function(e, swipe) { console.log(direction) };    and it's throwing a 'direction is not defined' error.
[10:36:51] <hlvwrk> I wasn't abel to setup a fiddle because I don't have a host for this.
[10:37:10] <hlvwrk> and no CDN for the external script ;p
[10:37:25] <hlvwrk> apparently you cannot use github's repo as a CDN.
[10:37:50] <jdewald> hlvwrk: I thought there was a 'rawcontent' cdn
[10:38:19] <hlvwrk> when i attempted adding it into jsfiddle it spat out an error saying 'Github is not a CDN don't assume this will work' alert
[10:38:19] <hlvwrk> lol
[10:38:47] <jdewald> try cdn.rawgit.com
[10:38:48] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk try what i said.
[10:38:57] <robertmaxrees> $(element).swipe(function(e, direction) { console.log(direction) });
[10:39:04] <hlvwrk> ah. Thanks
[10:39:04] <hlvwrk> sec
[10:39:07] <robertmaxrees> the thing you log out has to be defined in the function args...
[10:40:44] <hlvwrk> AH.
[10:41:06] <hlvwrk> I thought the event itself had to be defined, not the specific piece.
[10:41:13] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:41:21] <robertmaxrees> the first arg is the event object.
[10:41:34] <robertmaxrees> the following ones are the ones listed out on the readme on that repo.
[10:42:24] <hlvwrk> Worked. Thankyou.
[10:43:33] <hlvwrk> Now... one last thing ;p
[10:43:43] <hlvwrk> sec  making a fiddle.
[10:46:35] <hlvwrk> http://jsfiddle.net/f2ben2oa/ how would I make it output just the direction to another element?
[10:46:45] <hlvwrk> right now it's outputting [object Object]
[10:47:24] <robertmaxrees> console.log() the object and look to see if any of the properties on there have what you want.
[10:47:43] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/f2ben2oa/1/
[10:47:56] <robertmaxrees> looks like that second are is actually all of the swipe data.
[10:48:29] <hlvwrk> boom. you're awesome.
[10:48:30] <hlvwrk> thank you.
[10:49:05] <robertmaxrees> console.log() is your friend.
[10:49:32] <hlvwrk> I need better friends apparently.
[10:49:32] <hlvwrk> :(
[11:05:54] <winegoddess> am i here?
[11:06:12] <robertmaxrees> where else would you be?
[11:06:20] <snover> this conversation is so meta
[11:06:50] <winegoddess> thanks robertmaxrees - i keep getting bounced. wasn't sure if i was here. thank you.
[11:06:56] <winegoddess> Jquery animations - I see they were in place in 1.x - does this mean they will work across IE6,7,8?  I am trying to find a list of what might not work. i found one blog post saying to not use fast, or easing functions...
[11:07:12] <winegoddess> ooh i am not seeing disconnect / reconnect now - yippee!!!
[11:07:43] <robertmaxrees> winegoddess are you talking about http://api.jquery.com/animate/ ?
[11:07:55] <robertmaxrees> could you perhaps clarify your question?
[11:09:45] <zizzle> Hey guys, trying to get a change function working on this simple Highcharts example.. I get it to change on one click of the radio button but not back.. any suggestions? http://jsfiddle.net/e8w34ooa/4/
[11:10:34] <winegoddess> thanks robertmaxrees - I'm referring to animate, as well as other effects like fadeIn and fadeOut.  From the query site i believe it should work if using JQuery 1.x - since nothing says otherwise.
[11:10:50] <robertmaxrees> winegoddess i think you need to read http://jquery.com/browser-support/
[11:10:54] <winegoddess> however i have then read that IE8 chokes when you do things fast
[11:11:02] <robertmaxrees> basically, anything in the 1.x version supports IE6 and above.
[11:11:16] <robertmaxrees> there may be mitigating factors/performance concerns, though.
[11:11:26] <winegoddess> robertmaxrees: Yes, that is what seems to be in conflict , one sec let me get the blog post I'm referring to
[11:11:46] <snover> old ie is slow. period. who cares? anyone that is still using those browsers is used to it
[11:12:03] <winegoddess> http://gabrieleromanato.name/jquery-and-ie8-developing-and-debugging/
[11:12:05] <snover> do what you need to do to provide a good experience for everyone else
[11:12:33] <winegoddess> "not all of the features offered by jQuery work correctly on this browser"
[11:12:50] <snover> so, first off, that article is two years old
[11:13:21] <winegoddess> I'm hoping to find a listing of known issues?  Im doing research and trying to get a list if there exists, of what does not work. I could go thru and test each one, and maybe i will have to, but hoping to find something. - my googling not the best today
[11:13:27] <robertmaxrees> zizzle the change function is working as intended.  $('#KPI_Penetration_Chart').highcharts().series[0].setData(valueData); is what's broken.
[11:13:31] <snover> second it’s just factually wrong
[11:13:39] <robertmaxrees> winegoddess what are you actually trying to accomplish here?
[11:13:46] <winegoddess> 2 years old, but if i understand form what you posted form the query site, 1.x is not being updated. so it could still be true
[11:13:48] <robertmaxrees> compiling a list like that tells me there's something else up.
[11:14:00] <robertmaxrees> winegoddess 1.x IS beind updated.
[11:14:16] <zizzle> robertmaxrees ok thanks for looking, what's wrong with that?
[11:14:18] <robertmaxrees> *being.  where did you read that it isn't?
[11:14:32] <robertmaxrees> zizzle i have no clue.  maybe ask in a channel about highcharts or whatever?
[11:14:46] <winegoddess> ooh, hope i get new features. :)     Im wrapping my head around what will work and what will not. I want to know what I am in for when trying to use these fathers and their support on browsers.
[11:14:49] <Ilhami> hello robertmaxrees
[11:15:22] <robertmaxrees> winegoddess 1.11 has new features.  it's basically lockstepped with the 2.x series for features.
[11:15:34] <robertmaxrees> the only difference between 1.x and 2.x is browser support.
[11:15:48] <robertmaxrees> the naming convention is changing in v3 to better illustrate that distinction.
[11:15:50] <robertmaxrees> hey Ilhami
[11:16:07] <Ilhami> how are you?
[11:16:41] <robertmaxrees> i'm alright.  a little tired.  you?
[11:17:06] <Ilhami> same.
[11:18:14] <Ilhami> Well basically I need to prepend a div to another div.. so I think I could do something like $("#target").prependTo(#destination); ?
[11:18:29] <robertmaxrees> Ilhami there's also .prepend()
[11:18:42] <rubyonrailed> Hey, when using contenteditable, how can I make it so the text that is being typed is automatically h1?
[11:18:52] <zizzle> Anyone have experience with HighCharts? Trying to get a change function working on this simple Highcharts example.. I get it to change on one click of the radio button but not back.. any suggestions? http://jsfiddle.net/e8w34ooa/4/
[11:19:05] <robertmaxrees> zizzle ask in a channel about highcharts.
[11:19:08] <zizzle> robertmaxrees, sorry no action in that channel
[11:19:18] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change the topic of this channel :)
[11:19:28] <Ilhami> :D
[11:19:45] <Ilhami> is there any significant difference between preprendTo and prepend?
[11:20:01] <snover> hey, post office, i went to the DMV to renew my driver license but there was a line, so can you do it for me?
[11:20:13] <robertmaxrees> Ilhami the docs explain it :)
[11:23:26] <Ilhami> gurke_, welcome to the room
[12:07:17] <joeyDB> is it possible to use something like .position() but tell it what the relative container is?
[12:08:08] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to use .offset() of the two elements.
[12:08:30] <joeyDB> hm but offset can only use viewport, right?
[12:09:13] <robertmaxrees> right, so you get the offset of container foo, and the offset of container bar - the difference between the two is what you're looking for.
[12:09:14] <BillCriswell> offset() should be using the parent?
[12:09:42] <robertmaxrees> he wants to specify the container it's offset from.
[12:09:46] <robertmaxrees> offset is thewindow.
[12:10:10] <joeyDB> well
[12:10:21] <BillCriswell> I thought position would be the window?
[12:10:28] <joeyDB> i have a simple link that activates a popover
[12:10:30] <BillCriswell> Ohhh
[12:10:39] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell flip the two :)
[12:10:42] <joeyDB> i need to know where the y coords of the link
[12:10:47] <joeyDB> yeah it's the reverse billy
[12:10:55] <joeyDB> ;D sup buddy
[12:10:59] <robertmaxrees> joeyDB is the popover like a tooltip?
[12:11:13] <joeyDB> kinda, it's got a variable height though
[12:11:31] <robertmaxrees> check out powertip or any of the other libraries.
[12:11:50] <joeyDB> i guess i'll look at their source. I can't add another plugin at this point
[12:12:06] <robertmaxrees> if you're grappling with positioning the tooltip, set it to position: fixed; and look at the x,y of the mouse relative to the window.
[12:12:32] <robertmaxrees> also try to append the tooltip markup to the <body> tag instead of any child content.
[12:16:07] <joeyDB> hmm.. all good ideas robertmaxrees thanks
[12:16:26] <robertmaxrees> I worked with the guy who wrote powertip and learned some of the hard lessons from him.
[12:16:56] <joeyDB> man... i don't think anybody i work with knows how difficult this is...and to make it work responsively too
[12:17:14] <robertmaxrees> that's a big part of being a developer.
[12:19:33] <BillCriswell> What's a good use for .position()
[12:21:31] <joeyDB> position is good if you're trying to keep everything contained inside an element, BillCriswell
[12:21:40] <joeyDB> unfortunately that's not enough for me
[12:22:14] <joeyDB> my problem is this
[12:22:45] <joeyDB> using .position() works fine for most of these terms because it's just paragraph after paragraph inside this big DOM element
[12:23:45] * CssNoob good morning and good night y'all
[12:26:03] <BillCriswell> joeyDB: I think I'd need to udnerstand that big picture. I just find it weird I never needed .position() haha. Makes me think I've been overcomplicating something.
[12:26:20] <robertmaxrees> eh, it comes with its own caveats.
[12:26:23] <joeyDB> yeah
[12:26:25] <joeyDB> well
[12:26:55] <joeyDB> my problem is that if one of these popover triggers is inside a blockquote or ul... my positioning is totally f'd
[12:27:08] <joeyDB> sooooo close
[12:27:52] <BillCriswell> joeyDB: Can you make a small demo?
[12:28:09] <BillCriswell> If you feel it's worth it I mean.
[12:35:11] <joeyDB> BillCriswell:  I feel that it's worth it but this thing ajaxs out to get content and stuff I wonder how I'd trim it down to something that would still be useable
[12:35:31] <notchris> hey @joeyDB  :P
[12:35:54] <joeyDB> this thing is 458 lines with conservative comments
[12:35:56] <joeyDB> howdy notchris
[12:36:17] <notchris> How do I make this transition smoother?
[12:36:18] <notchris> $(this).removeClass("col-md-4").addClass("col-md-12");
[12:39:25] <hoverbear> Issuing a `$.get('/foo')` request from the browser, response is a `302` redirect to `/bar`, how do I have the browser actually follow this redirect?
[12:39:50] <hoverbear> Instead of returning the contents of the redirect page in the callback
[12:40:29] <BillCriswell> notchris: Try it without the removeClass.
[12:40:43] <BillCriswell> or add the col-md-12 then remove the col-md-4.
[12:41:40] <joeyDB> you could make opacity: 0 for a sec while swapping the classes
[12:41:49] <joeyDB> then fade back in
[12:42:42] <notchris> Ahhh
[12:42:45] <notchris> You guys are clever
[12:43:54] <notchris> This didn’t work:
[12:43:55] <notchris> $(this).removeClass("col-md-4").delay(3000).addClass("col-md-12");
[12:44:02] <joeyDB> no no
[12:44:02] <notchris> I couldn’t see a delay
[12:44:10] <joeyDB> that doesn't work
[12:44:15] <notchris> Why
[12:44:19] <joeyDB> that only works for animate()
[12:44:22] <notchris> Ahh
[12:44:34] <joeyDB> wow. i actually knew something.
[12:44:41] * joeyDB throws confetti
[12:44:49] <notchris> How do I cause a delay without animate
[12:44:57] <joeyDB> setTimeout
[12:45:30] <joeyDB> you know how setTimeout works, notchris ?
[12:45:36] <joeyDB> gunna have to use a couple callbacks
[12:45:42] <notchris> Found: http://www.sitepoint.com/settimeout-example/
[12:46:18] <joeyDB> notchris: just make sure you don't make the user wait longer than they have to because of incorrect use of callback or too much delay
[12:48:06] <notchris> @joeyDB http://pastebin.com/ni7mfnUT
[12:48:29] <notchris> I messed up
[12:56:35] <joeyDB> notchris: hide() applies display: block after changing opacity to 0
[12:56:44] <joeyDB> sorry... display: none
[13:01:46] <joeyDB> ok... i don't understand
[13:05:00] <BillCriswell> notchris: What's your goal?
[13:05:16] <BillCriswell> notchris: Also, $(this) inside a timeout probably isn't what you want to do.
[13:05:39] <notchris> @BillCriswell http://www.ctsciencecenter.org/dev/exhibits/
[13:05:52] <notchris> So I have it close to how I would like
[13:07:11] <BillCriswell> sweeeeet
[13:47:51] <rubyonrailed> How can I have a content editable area, that starts typing in h1?
[13:51:39] <NoiseEee> <h1 contenteditable='true'>type here</h1>
[13:53:25] <joeyDB> ok i'm mad at javascript. boo! why does the following behavior happen? http://jsbin.com/gicazu/1/edit?html,js,console
[13:53:44] <joeyDB> I expect the second time i call outerHeight that it gives me the updated height
[13:55:28] <NoiseEee> silly iife's, you calc them right away
[13:57:12] <joeyDB> NoiseEee: is that directed to me?
[13:57:23] <NoiseEee> yes joeyDB, i don't know how to update that JSBin
[13:57:57] <joeyDB> NoiseEee: http://jsbin.com/gicazu/1/edit ?
[13:58:05] <robertmaxrees> joeyDB height: (function() { - you're calling the function once.
[13:58:09] <robertmaxrees> and assigning the value.
[13:58:13] <robertmaxrees> don't use an IIFE for it.
[13:58:17] <NoiseEee> ^^
[13:58:29] <NoiseEee> height: function() { return $('#popup-glossary').outerHeight();}
[13:58:31] <joeyDB> but i want it to execute the function everytime i call popup.height
[13:58:41] <joeyDB> oh
[13:58:42] <joeyDB> so
[13:58:44] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:58:47] <joeyDB> IIFE only execute once?
[13:58:55] <robertmaxrees> yes
[13:59:00] <NoiseEee> yes, you're invoking it immediately
[13:59:01] <joeyDB> like... i get that... but they can't be called again?
[13:59:05] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:59:08] <joeyDB> oh
[13:59:11] <robertmaxrees> you're returning the value and that's it.
[13:59:12] <joeyDB> because it's anonymous actually
[13:59:14] <robertmaxrees> never calls it again.
[13:59:16] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:59:19] <robertmaxrees> because it's immediately invoked.
[13:59:27] <joeyDB> ok
[13:59:32] <robertmaxrees> you use them becuase you want a one-time use scope that you can throw away.
[13:59:43] <NoiseEee> its just not a case where IIFEs make any sense
[14:00:00] <NoiseEee> you want to run a function when its called, not return the value of a once-calculated function
[14:00:57] <joeyDB> ok ok so
[14:01:32] <joeyDB> this still doesn't work for some reason though.. it just returns the function http://jsbin.com/gicazu/1/edit?html,js,console
[14:02:08] <robertmaxrees> right, because now that's a function.
[14:02:09] <robertmaxrees> not a property.
[14:02:10] <zizzle> Anyone have experience with HighCharts? Trying to get a .change function working on this simple Highcharts example.. I get it to change on one click of the radio button but a second time, the test of .change doing something else is working.. any suggestions? http://jsfiddle.net/e8w34ooa/8/
[14:02:11] <robertmaxrees> height()
[14:02:45] <robertmaxrees> joeyDB and you don't wrap literally everything in a function.
[14:02:50] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/xadogagipo/1/edit?html,js,console
[14:03:02] <snover> zizzle: STOP.
[14:03:30] <zizzle> snover ok
[14:03:43] <joeyDB> oh sonufa...
[14:03:55] * joeyDB exhales deeply
[14:04:01] <joeyDB> ok
[14:04:02] <robertmaxrees> :D
[14:04:05] <joeyDB> lol
[14:04:18] <joeyDB> geez i wonder how i made this far... EVERY DAY
[14:04:37] <robertmaxrees> it happens.
[14:05:46] <joeyDB> thanks robertmaxrees. I don't think this is the first time you've helped me out
[14:05:59] <robertmaxrees> don't mention it :)  it's what we do.
[14:06:54] <joeyDB> and... within an object like the one i'm creating.. is it possible to use a key before the end of the object?
[14:07:38] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:08:05] <joeyDB> so i defined what popup.el is popup = { el: function(){...
[14:08:24] <joeyDB> on the very next line I have a reference to the object i targeted in el:
[14:08:52] <joeyDB> is it possible to reference popup.el from popup.top before the object's ending } ?
[14:09:23] <robertmaxrees> you mean access another property in the same object?
[14:09:30] <joeyDB> yes
[14:09:53] <robertmaxrees> not when using an object literal, no.
[14:10:06] <robertmaxrees> you can do it after you initialize it, however.
[14:10:39] <joeyDB> ahh... here we go
[14:11:18] <joeyDB> is that technically a constructor function then?
[14:11:22] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:11:29] <robertmaxrees> you're using an object literal there.
[14:11:39] <robertmaxrees> constructor functions require that you use the new keyword.
[14:12:07] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid creating complex objects like that if possible.
[14:13:03] <joeyDB> in general? or just in my example?
[14:13:08] <robertmaxrees> in general.
[14:13:21] <joeyDB> whew
[14:13:23] <joeyDB> ok
[14:29:03] <frank_o> Hi! How come this click-to-play-HTML5-video (of Obama) won't stop the video on the 2nd click? http://jsbin.com/sojizuwide/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[14:29:34] <frank_o> Oops, nevermind
[14:30:05] <robertmaxrees> scope ;)
[14:30:47] <frank_o> robertmaxrees: Cheers!
[14:32:14] <frank_o> http://jsbin.com/sojizuwide/2/edit perfect
[14:46:11] <decx> i think the video api has a built in way to check if a video is playing
[14:46:17] <decx> .paused
[14:48:34] <frank_o> decx: Nice
[14:55:21] <frank_o> Here with autoplaying if visible within the viewport: http://jsbin.com/sojizuwide/4/edit
[14:55:39] <frank_o> You guys likie?
[15:05:00] <frank_o> decx: here with .paused -- http://jsbin.com/sojizuwide/6/edit -- thanks for the tip
[15:05:36] <frank_o> so glad i can do it like this as opposed to loading some huge video lib with a fancy UI
[15:15:40] <d0de> I have a fade-out function that runs once a second. It takes an input of time and each seconds steps down a value so that it reaches 0 when the time runs out. It's linear - each second, it subtracts (value / timeleft) from the value. But I want to make it subtract more per second near the beginning and less per second near the end
[15:15:43] <d0de> what function can I use?
[15:20:31] <Robdgreat> 1 - (total time / time remaining)^2
[15:20:35] <Robdgreat> (I think)
[15:21:48] <d0de> Robdgreat, will test, thanks
[15:30:01] <d0de> Robdgreat, won't total time / time remaining always start as 1?
[15:30:17] <d0de> in which case you're multiplying by (1-1)^2 or zero?
[15:31:10] <Robdgreat> substitute total time for 1
[15:31:20] <Robdgreat> wait
[15:32:02] <Robdgreat> total time - (1 - (total time / time remaining)^2) is what I think I meant
[15:32:49] <Robdgreat> so yeah, when it starts no time will have elapsed, so you'll subtract 0
[15:33:00] <Robdgreat> I haven't tested this
[15:33:05] <Robdgreat> it was off the top of my head
[15:38:52] <zdubbz> im getting a "goofy" response with .length
[15:39:03] <zdubbz> i am using it on a p tag within a div
[15:39:28] <zdubbz> on first call it gets the correct number.  but as I add more p's to the div, it is off by 2.
[15:39:36] <zdubbz> its driving me nuts.  I cant figure it out
[15:39:57] <robertmaxrees> can you show your code?
[15:40:20] <zdubbz> can i paste it in here or should i use pastebin or something
[15:40:23] <zdubbz> ?
[15:40:35] <zdubbz> sorry, im pretty new to this stuff
[15:40:43] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle is preferable.
[15:40:45] <robertmaxrees> or fixee.
[15:40:49] <zdubbz> ok
[15:42:26] <d0de> Robdgreat, thank you but I don't think that will work
[15:42:35] <Robdgreat> ah well
[15:42:51] <Robdgreat> wish I'd had time to test or whatever
[15:44:07] <d0de> basically what I'm trying to do is this: http://jsfiddle.net/78n9h0Lx/2/
[15:49:41] <sammych> worklight/phonegap app: the app pegs a single core when it's in landscape. Switch to portrait, core is unused. Back to landscape, core is back in full use. jQM
[15:50:25] <sammych> on top of that, the webview doesn't redraw properly in landscape
[15:51:17] <sammych> ahmmm, seems like it could be an issue with the header
[15:55:04] <Robdgreat> d0de: I understand what you're trying to do
[15:55:12] <HowardwLo> if I want something to show when I scroll to a certain height, should that be an on scroll event listener? like if scrollTop == 2500 { do this } ?
[15:55:51] <decx> there's no guarantee you land exactly on 2500
[15:56:40] <decx> do > 2500 && stillinvisible and change the stillvisible to false
[15:56:59] <decx> so you dont repeat the action once it's done
[15:57:39] <HowardwLo> decx: i see. but it is an on scroll event listner right?
[15:58:15] <decx> yes
[16:01:16] <HowardwLo> got it, thank you!
[16:03:16] <sammych> weirnre dies on the device when I try to profile it :(
[16:03:26] <sammych> *weinre
[16:04:39] <zdubbz> robertmaxreese > actually my code works in jfiddle, just not in WP widget admin.  haha  so i dont know what to do.
[16:11:30] <damarusama> how would I go about populating a dropdown list from a json
[16:47:24] <HowardwLo> http://jsfiddle.net/Qu32P/ if i also want to move over height and width attributes (in addition to src) would it be better to just swap the whole <img> tag?
[16:47:44] <robertmaxrees> "move over"?
[16:48:11] <HowardwLo> ya, not all the width and height attributes of the img tags are the same
[16:48:31] <robertmaxrees> what does "move over" mean?
[16:48:43] <HowardwLo> erm...swap?
[16:48:47] <bengalo> set those attributes to his new img
[16:48:50] <bengalo> i guess
[16:48:58] <HowardwLo> ya, set those to the 5 that are displayed
[16:49:01] <robertmaxrees> don't remove elements if you can avoid it.
[16:49:02] <HowardwLo> active* i mean
[16:49:08] <robertmaxrees> copy it, edit it in a fragment, and pop the new one in.
[16:49:15] <robertmaxrees> that'd be a little smarter.
[16:50:49] <HowardwLo> fragment?
[16:50:54] <HowardwLo> is that documentFragment?
[16:51:08] <robertmaxrees> if you're using jquery, .clone() it
[16:51:12] <robertmaxrees> edit the clone.
[16:51:16] <robertmaxrees> replace the original with the clone.
[16:51:51] <HowardwLo> replace one of the 5 active with the clone ?
[16:52:01] <robertmaxrees> whichever one you want, yess.
[16:52:09] <robertmaxrees> the idea is to reduce the amount of times you edit the DOM.
[16:52:24] <robertmaxrees> instead of editing height then width, make a copy, edit the copy, and to a single replacement.
[16:52:48] <robertmaxrees> that might not give you a huge savings in this case, but that can work well when you have a lot going on.
[16:53:06] <HowardwLo> what about the preservation step, where I have to move one of the actives to inactive? I think i would have to do two copies at once?
[16:54:06] <robertmaxrees> sorry didn't really read through your code.  one sec.
[16:54:24] <HowardwLo> thats alright :D
[16:54:41] <HowardwLo> i also think i messed up the random selection for inactive, but i’ll do that after :|
[16:56:27] <robertmaxrees> let's back up and start over - what'
[16:56:36] <robertmaxrees> *what's the impetus behind these questions?
[16:56:40] <robertmaxrees> performance?  or something else?
[16:56:56] <HowardwLo> i just want it to work
[16:57:07] <HowardwLo> and its a very very small part of a very small site
[16:57:14] <HowardwLo> so slight performance issues aren’t going to be noticeable
[16:57:31] <HowardwLo> but i want to show 5, and randomly swap the boxes with one of the inactive ones
[16:57:43] <HowardwLo> so if i ahve 11 boxes, 5 active 6 inactive, it’ll randomly rotate everything in
[16:58:47] <robertmaxrees> ah.  i see what you're getting at.
[16:58:54] <robertmaxrees> what you've got is in the right direction.
[16:59:11] <robertmaxrees> consider using .prop() instead of .attr(), and don't do things like img.active
[16:59:16] <robertmaxrees> just .active
[16:59:26] <robertmaxrees> also, attribute selectors are kind of a no-no
[17:01:00] <HowardwLo> so should i be cloning both?
[17:01:36] <robertmaxrees> eh.
[17:01:37] <robertmaxrees> maybe?
[17:01:43] <robertmaxrees> i dunno that it really matters in this case.
[17:01:48] <robertmaxrees> don't prematurely optimize.
[17:21:01] <Lewix> my jquery kung fu wen trough the windows I dont remember shit =)
[17:21:26] <Lewix>  jQuery('[name=filter_by_type]').val(type).change();
[17:21:40] <Lewix> is that the right way to select a element in a dropdown
[19:48:27] <Sherafff> $("img").on("error", ...) doesn't work?
[20:28:31] <zdubbz> any of you familiar with building wp widgets in the admin?

[22:17:42] <vTwoRockman> hi
[22:18:26] <vTwoRockman> how i can pass GET parameter in parent to iframe?
[22:43:21] <nbros652> Is there any particular reason that my $.post function does not run in sequence? It's inside a $.each() function, and all of the $.post calls happen after all of the .each have been processed rather than during each loop.
[22:47:17] <root3d> nbros652, i can guess it is because "post" is async in js
[22:48:04] <nbros652> root3d, so if I make the call as a sync call, no problem?
[22:49:14] <root3d> nbros652, i don't know if that's possible: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/133310/how-can-i-get-jquery-to-perform-a-synchronous-rather-than-asynchronous-ajax-re
[22:49:16] <root3d> read comments
[22:49:31] <nbros652> root3d, it's possible using the $.ajax function.
[22:49:42] <nbros652> I'll give it a whirl and see what happens.
[22:49:54] <root3d> ok. update later
[22:58:51] <nbros652> root3d, nope ... event with asycn set to false, it still runs the ajax after the each has finished.
[23:00:16] <root3d> nbros652, you can use .next also
[23:00:35] <root3d> while .next()!== false ..do loop
[23:00:50] <root3d> nbros652, kindof ,not exact syntax
[23:01:32] <nbros652> root3d, I'll try that.
[23:13:50] <Cork> root3d: next() !== false won't ever work
[23:14:04] <Cork> root3d: as jquery always return an object
[23:14:29] <root3d> Cork, i told kindof syntax , i know that's awfully wrong
[23:14:49] <Cork> well it isn't even a workable solution
[23:14:55] <root3d> Cork, it has to be called on someobject
[23:15:16] <root3d> hasNext or next
[23:16:00] <Cork> the solution to use is to use a function you chain with done
[23:16:42] <Cork> and then loop with that function instead of a syncron each
[23:18:39] <Cork> nbros652, root3d: http://jsfiddle.net/byjvf6xe/
[23:22:23] <root3d> nbros652, ^^
[23:23:07] <root3d> Cork, so .always works as sync ?
[23:23:13] <Cork> no
[23:23:23] <Cork> always is always called
[23:23:38] <Cork> both if the network call errors out or succeeds
[23:24:20] <Cork> what makes this work is that the callback calls the same function over and over again with an index incrementation
[23:24:29] <Cork> but the loop is still async
[23:24:44] <Cork> (and it is what you want, as sync would hang the page)
[23:27:07] <nbros652> Cork, I tried with sync since I'm not worried about hanging in this case. It didn't work for me. I'll give your solution a go. The while (or for) loop option is not working for me on the first go.
[23:27:48] <Cork> nbros652: side note, never use sync network calls
[23:28:18] <Cork> nbros652: it is really bad from a users perspective and should be avoided as far as possible
[23:28:24] <nbros652> Cork, pardon the ignorance, but if the call takes no time at all, why?
[23:28:29] <Cork> it is also deprecated in both jquery and the web standard
[23:28:33] <Cork> and doesn't get updates
[23:28:49] <Cork> nbros652: you can't ever be sure the network call doesn't take any time for the user
[23:29:05] <Cork> they might be on a wifi hotspot and lose there connection to the router
[23:29:14] <nbros652> true... but I'm talking very small scale on a local network.
[23:29:15] <Cork> and then it will take 5 minutes before they can user there browser AT ALL
[23:29:44] <nbros652> I see what you're saying and completely agree...
[23:30:08] <nbros652> sync calls do not seem to be deprecated with $.ajax
[23:31:22] <Cork> ah, they have changed the wording in the docks
[23:31:41] <Cork> "As of jQuery 1.8, the use of async: false with jqXHR ($.Deferred) is deprecated" <-- this used to just say "deprecated"
[23:31:44] <nbros652> Yeah, I see that now. I agree. Don't use if possible.
[23:32:09] <Cork> nbros652: so ya, the feature isn't deprecated, but the old wording said it was
[23:32:26] <Cork> though it is deprecated in the web standard
[23:32:43] <nbros652> Cork, root3d: thanks both. I think I'll combine ideas from both approach using a for loop.
[23:32:49] <Cork> sync xhr is kept for compatibility with old sites, and isn't developed anymore
[23:33:00] <Cork> no new feature will ever be added to it
[23:33:07] <nbros652> gotcha
[23:33:14] <Cork> nbros652: you can't use a for loop with the function
[23:33:21] <Cork> as a for loop by definition is sync
[23:33:33] <Cork> nbros652: the point of the function i gave you is that it creates a loop
[23:34:17] <nbros652> I see ... I like it.
[23:34:17] <Cork> nbros652: http://jsfiddle.net/byjvf6xe/1/
[23:34:58] <Cork> and the urls array could be anything, if you want to call the same url it could just be if(index > 10) { return }
[23:35:47] <nbros652> right... You've convinced me. I think I'll make use of your approach.
[23:36:08] <dotnetted> Hey all - Is it possible to delay <input> field updates until "Done" is clicked when using the jQuery UI DatePicker? I have an input field that is redrawn every time onchange is triggered. This causes the UI datepicker to lose its element while still open. Thanks!
[23:36:26] <nbros652> recursion is handy
[23:36:40] <Cork> it is
[23:37:08] <Cork> dotnetted: sounds like you should look at the update you do and limit what it touches instead
[23:37:31] <Cork> dotnetted: i don't think you can delay the event triggering as the user make changes in the widget
[23:40:41] <dotnetted> Cork: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6056287/jquery-ui-datepicker-prevent-refresh-onselect - Just found this and I think it'll work - was hoping for a better option-based solution
[23:43:57] <lintguy> I'm using inArray to check if a number is in an array, the array is from JSON but even though the number IS in the array i get -1. In the console, it also shows two functions in the array… i didn't think that was possible?
[23:44:20] <Cork> dotnetted: i would look at why you need this and fix the bug there instead of hacking the plugin
[23:44:33] <lintguy> Cork!
[23:45:06] <lintguy> The IRC Lurker and jQuery extraordinaire!
[23:45:33] <lintguy> Do i need to iterate on each json array item and check if it is an array item or a function or what?
[23:45:49] <Cork> lintguy: http://jsfiddle.net/h0pgkenq/
[23:45:53] <Cork> this is most likely what you see
[23:46:28] <lintguy> Oooh… It's a string, not a number
[23:46:59] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/h0pgkenq/1/
[23:47:03] <Cork> some more examples
[23:47:04] <dotnetted> Cork: there is no bug - I have a form field that is redrawn from the result of an ajax request every time a change is made to it - I am initializing datepicker on the field after every response
[23:47:37] <Cork> dotnetted: so in the change event start a timer
[23:47:51] <dotnetted> Unfortunately there is no option in datepicker to hold off on changes to the trigger field until after it has been closed :(
[23:47:54] <Cork> and only redraw if the events from the calender is firing a bit apart
[23:48:07] <Cork> dotnetted: cause it makes no sense to do so
[23:48:18] <Cork> change should fire when the user change the field
[23:48:22] <Cork> not x amount of time after
[23:49:06] <lintguy> Cork: Hm, even if i try forcing it as a string it doesn't match it, because it IS a number in the array.
[23:49:20] <dotnetted> Cork: The user is picking multiple selection from a popup to pick a date - It actually makes more sense for the change to happen after they are finished, not while they are picking each part of the date...
[23:49:21] <lintguy> Cork: The array looks like this, [187, 189, addRange: function, clear: function]
[23:49:23] <Cork> lintguy: fiddle
[23:49:45] <Cork> dotnetted: http://jsfiddle.net/yuqyk929/
[23:50:00] <Cork> change the number to what ever you want it to be
[23:50:23] <Cork> dotnetted: also what you might want is to create your own even when the change actually result in the situation you want
[23:50:30] <Cork> and only fire on that instead
[23:50:57] <lintguy> Cork: The json looks like this "inStock":1
[23:51:00] <lintguy> So clearly not a string
[23:51:12] <lintguy> I'll try setting up a fiddle then
[23:52:07] <Cork> ?paste @ lintguy
[23:52:07] <b-ot> lintguy: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:53:19] <lintguy> I don't know how addRange: function, clear: function got into the mix...
[23:53:23] <grom358> jQuery UI Autocomplete is not accessible when I'm testing with VoiceOver. is this a known issue?
[23:55:41] <Cork> grom358: it should be it uses aria and everything http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/autocomplete/default.html
[23:56:45] <grom358> Cork: that demo.. doesn't have aria for the autocomplete options
[23:57:05] <Cork> grom358: not in the ul list, but it shouldn't need to
[23:57:13] <Cork> it is a point list
[23:57:15] <grom358> Cork: from my testing.. it needs role="listbox" and role="option" for VoiceOver
[23:57:23] <Cork> hmm
[23:57:38] <grom358> Cork: i'm on mac osx 10.9.5
[23:57:45] <Cork> <-- doesn't use mac
[23:58:55] <grom358> Cork: i'll try make a patch
[23:59:01] <lintguy> Cork uses linux?
[23:59:14] <Cork> grom358: also have a look in http://bugs.jqueryui.com/
[23:59:20] <Cork> lintguy: mostely ya
[23:59:25] <lintguy> Cewl
[23:59:27] <Cork> i have a windows vm too
[23:59:44] <Cork> i have access to a mac in a different office
[23:59:50] <lintguy> Why not OS X vm? Works very well on KVM now.
[23:59:52] <Cork> but as you can't virtualize mac...
[23:59:56] <Cork> you can't
