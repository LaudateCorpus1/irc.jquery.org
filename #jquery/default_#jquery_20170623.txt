[06:31:16] <sigdk> I have an input box of type password. I want to switch it to type text whenever it empties (length drops to 0). How can I implement that?
[07:35:22] <decx> what would be the point of that sigdk
[08:15:32] <dan_j> How do I select all checkboxes in a collection which aren't disabled?  I'm using DataTables and the checkboxes are in one of the columns.
[08:15:36] <dan_j> This isn't working
[08:15:38] <dan_j> $('tr.selected:not(:disabled) input[type="checkbox"]', api.table().container()).prop('checked', true);	
[08:35:35] <jarard> hi I am sending a ajax request to a php file, I can see that the php is echoing back a 200 response. On ym jquery script I am tring to output the reply with console.log(reply) but it doesn't fire
[08:35:44] <jarard> i don't see how that it possible
[09:11:53] <jarard> is anyone home?
[10:01:56] <MikeD_> i'm at work
[11:00:40] <Neo_papa> how choose dynamically created elements ?
[11:00:51] <Neo_papa> I need choose all elements with class
[11:03:00] <lilybell> You'd have to loop through all the elements and then check each one to see if it has that specific class.
[12:24:32] <catbadger>  I am loading a script by requirejs. that script includes many other scripts with an ajax call to the same origin as the index page. when errors happen in the ajax-included I'm getting "Script Error at 0" inside the window.onerror function As I'm building error reporting, it's holding me back. Anyone else dealt with this bug in Chrome?
[12:56:18] <Violinist> hola
[12:56:24] <Violinist> o/
[12:56:32] <Violinist> how to count number of elements
[12:56:43] <Violinist> $(self.options.selector).find(".flot-x-axis > div").each
[12:56:54] <Violinist> .count?
[12:56:59] <taplar> length
[12:59:14] <Violinist> grassyass
[13:00:16] <Violinist> doesnt work
[13:00:28] <taplar> what are you doing?
[13:00:39] <Violinist>  $(self.options.selector).find(".flot-x-axis > div").count()
[13:00:42] <Violinist> tried  $(self.options.selector).find(".flot-x-axis > div").count
[13:00:47] <taplar> no, length
[13:00:54] <Violinist> omg
[13:00:55] <taplar> $(selector).length
[13:00:58] <Violinist> <- idiot
[13:16:26] <Violinist> if (i % 2 == 0) $(this).hide();
[13:16:37] <Violinist> doesnt seem to work same as in php
[13:19:51] <pavonia> Why would JS code work in PHP? O.o
[13:20:04] <pavonia> Oh, I misread
[13:21:37] <robertmaxrees> Violinist got a fiddle or something?
[13:25:37] <robertmaxrees> Violinist i ask because https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/q0qq3c9d/
[13:25:49] <robertmaxrees> it works, but I'm curious what you expect.
[13:30:22] <Violinist> no i guess modulator doest behave the same in js
[13:30:43] <Violinist> but this does
[13:30:44] <Violinist> return ((this % n) + n) % n;
[13:55:07] <taplar> % is just remainder
[13:55:55] <taplar> 3%3 = 0, 4%3 = 1
[13:56:04] <taplar> 6%3=0
[13:56:48] <taplar> repetitive values of 0-(n-1)
[13:58:04] <robertmaxrees> *modulo btw
[13:58:39] <taplar> modulus
[13:58:46] <taplar> (sp)
[13:59:00] <AwkwardCough> in js its remainder operator in php its a modulo
[13:59:14] <robertmaxrees> ohdamn
[13:59:18] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators#Remainder
[13:59:20] <taplar> the mathematical operation is modulus, :P
[13:59:41] <robertmaxrees> wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:modulo_operator
[13:59:41] <taplar> *shrug*
[13:59:48] <taplar> words are hard
[13:59:55] <robertmaxrees> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation
[14:01:00] <taplar> hah, so js you use remainder operator to get the remainder value.  in php you use the modulo operator to get the remainder value
[14:01:03] <taplar> -_-
[14:02:14] <AwkwardCough> yup
[14:02:31] * taplar hands AwkwardCough his $50
[14:02:54] * taplar %$50
[14:03:38] <Violinist> crap
[14:03:42] <Violinist> i have a problem
[14:04:01] <taplar> sup
[14:04:05] <robertmaxrees> mmmyessss?
[14:04:27] <Violinist> i want to remove % ticks from flot chart
[14:04:39] <Violinist> but the ticks in html r out of order
[14:05:36] <Violinist> omg da_wunder is here
[14:05:42] <Violinist> some1 stop him
[14:05:48] <Violinist> he folowed me
[14:05:49] <taplar> ?
[14:05:54] <da_wunder> ?
[14:06:03] <Violinist> srsly?
[14:06:13] <da_wunder> Violinist: i'm curious about your problem and trying to help you
[14:06:34] <Violinist> ok fine
[14:06:46] <da_wunder> Violinist: so how is .each working wrongly? i created this simple plunker which works like expected https://plnkr.co/edit/mo6OFzEeknHDinjSWw23?p=preview
[14:07:05] <Violinist> html is out of order
[14:07:10] <Violinist> i just looked
[14:07:42] <da_wunder> Violinist: that is why asked you to make plunker to demonstrate your problem so we can take a closer look
[14:07:56] <taplar> can you show us an example of your issue?
[14:08:04] <da_wunder> ^
[14:20:20] <Violinist> ok i got it
[14:20:35] <Violinist> i added the id to label
[14:20:47] <Violinist> now i can key into it and hide it
[14:24:06] <Violinist> brilliant
[14:24:10] <Violinist> \o/
[14:24:32] <da_wunder> Violinist: so wasn't .each problem after all ?
[14:48:34] <Violinist> no it was
[14:48:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:48:53] <Violinist> i mean not like .each is not working
[14:49:01] <taplar> never saw an example of the issue.... so.....
[14:49:05] <Violinist> but html is out of order
[14:49:06] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[14:49:08] <Violinist> thats all
[14:49:23] <robertmaxrees> "out of order" makes no sense, but okie :)
[14:49:42] <Violinist> anyhow lets stop trolling
[14:49:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:49:53] <robertmaxrees> nobody is trolling.
[14:50:01] <Violinist> great thanx
[14:50:19] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[14:50:47] <taplar> you asked for help.  we asked for more info.  followed by silence
[14:51:06] <taplar> kinda makes the whole help room concept not work
[15:14:54] <membiblio> Does anyone know why jquery (all so far up to and including) 3.2.1 makes, after the page loads and jquery runs, an additional request to the server called a 'xhr' request?   Basically in my logs the page is loading twice, once by the browser and once by jquery for some unknown reason - tia :)
[15:15:45] <taplar> where is the xhr trying to go?
[15:16:54] <membiblio> taplar: to the exact page jquery is running on - in my logs it looks like the page is loading twice and the urls look identical but presented 2 ways I can post the log entries if you would like to see - very weird and never seen before
[15:18:48] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/pfv84dp2/  i'm not seeing an xhr
[15:20:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah i'm not seeing a random XHR call happening
[15:20:13] <taplar> actually if i go to that page fresh i do see two xhrs, one's an OPTION and the other is a GET
[15:20:15] <membiblio> taplar: I'm seeing the xhr in developer tools in the Network tab as well as in my log I see two calls to the same page, one by the browser and, from developer tools network tab, one by jquery
[15:20:48] <membiblio> taplar: where are YOU seeing the xhr - on that fiddle page - does it show the network calls?
[15:21:07] <taplar> F12, looking in the xhr tab before pasting in the url to go to it
[15:21:17] <taplar> in chrome
[15:22:09] <membiblio> ok so you are looking in developer tools as well on the network tab
[15:22:26] <robertmaxrees> what kind of request is it?
[15:22:45] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing it here heh
[15:22:58] <membiblio> ok so I'm not too worried about this except I've never seen this behavior before in jquery and querying google for jquery xhr header returned no results
[15:23:07] <taplar> the fiddle is going to: https://counter.jsfiddle.net/pfv84dp2.json?k=aztojarx1q80000000000z
[15:23:22] <membiblio> AND my database stuff fires twice so double the calls to the server double the fun I guess
[15:23:25] <robertmaxrees> i don't think that's related.
[15:23:30] <taplar> yeah, idk
[15:23:55] <membiblio> what is a xhr request by jquery - setting up to do ajax stuff ?
[15:24:24] <robertmaxrees> you sure you aren't, like, including jquery twice?
[15:24:30] <membiblio> it is on a https connection and THAT is new to this site
[15:24:33] <robertmaxrees> could you share the page?
[15:25:00] <membiblio> robertmaxrees: no I'm not :) that is why I look at a tail of the logs and debug file as I have done that before
[15:25:28] <robertmaxrees> heh, i'd need to see the issue 'cause that sounds odd to me.
[15:25:33] <membiblio> sure https://astralhearts.com/website/profile?pid=9765
[15:26:29] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:26:50] <robertmaxrees> i see the issue.
[15:27:09] <membiblio> is it a dumb me issue or a subtle issue that I can be forgiven for?
[15:27:16] <membiblio> moist I am with antic
[15:27:19] <membiblio> ipation
[15:27:24] <robertmaxrees> line 140 on the page: starting with $(window).load(function() {  // Always Loaded at page load...
[15:27:46] <robertmaxrees> the first thing you do inside that is $.ajax({async: true});
[15:27:49] <robertmaxrees> that's what's firing that call.
[15:27:54] <membiblio> Gotcha!
[15:28:06] <taplar> it's like an ajax call that was never finished being implemented...
[15:28:25] <robertmaxrees> or they were trying to do ajaxSetup?
[15:28:38] <taplar> maybe
[15:28:39] <membiblio> I'm now trying to remember why I uncommented that out and then added it back in - just a sec
[15:28:44] <membiblio> let me comment it out
[15:28:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah, just kill it.
[15:30:03] <da_wunder> Violinist: remember that i mentioned this one on another channel "20:55 < da_wunder> and there people will also ask you a demonstration of that problem"
[15:30:15] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:30:20] <robertmaxrees> alright, i think he got the message :)
[15:30:49] <membiblio> I commented out and voila you are good! :)
[15:30:52] <membiblio> thank you
[15:30:56] <robertmaxrees> membiblio yep.
[15:31:12] <membiblio> Amazing you all are
[15:31:13] <taplar> cause after allllllllllllll........ your da wunderrrrrrrr waaaaaaalllllllllllll
[15:31:26] <membiblio> :)
[15:31:27] * taplar mouth guitars
[15:32:19] <da_wunder> ?
[15:32:28] <taplar> *shrug*
[15:32:30] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[16:05:40] <Violinist> ok guys
[16:05:44] <Violinist> i did it \o/
[16:05:48] <Violinist> congradulate me
[16:09:43] <da_wunder> nice to hear that
[16:10:59] <Violinist> i added the ids to the labels
[16:11:05] <Violinist> from the real data
[16:11:28] <Violinist> then looped over the real data instead of html
[16:11:49] <da_wunder> hard to say anything, because haven't seen any exmaple of your issue
[16:11:52] <Violinist> key into the html and hide it that way
[16:12:05] <Violinist> also my modulator is dynamic
[16:12:07] <Violinist> which is cool
[16:12:21] <Violinist> var mod = Math.round(total_label_width / chart_width);
[16:12:57] <da_wunder> totally random code without any context, but nice if you get your issue solved
[16:13:33] <Violinist> da_wunder, come to #programming
[16:13:55] <da_wunder> don't see the point
[16:14:02] <Violinist> lol
[16:15:30] <da_wunder> quite much irc channels where i'm atm so to add some new should have a good reason
[16:23:44] <da_wunder> Violinist: just to make sure, your problem was not on .each() just the selector you used ?
[16:24:27] <Violinist> no
[16:24:53] <Violinist> i did not realize that flot chart was putting the ticks html out of order
[16:25:18] <da_wunder> ok, so then no .each() problem at all
[16:25:52] <Violinist> no coz .each just cycles over whatever is there
[16:26:04] <da_wunder> that is what it does
[16:27:56] <taplar> i'm not sure what the disagreement is now
[16:28:40] <da_wunder> taplar: he issued that like "20:50 < Violinist> yeah its the .each is out of order"
[16:28:54] <taplar> i understand he had an issue, and he resolved it himself
[16:28:57] <taplar> so we get to move on
[16:29:04] <failbot> hiu
[16:29:28] <da_wunder> yeah, which is nice - i just to want to make sure that wasn't .each() problem
[16:29:58] <taplar> y?
[16:30:19] <Violinist> coz he loves me
[16:30:21] <failbot> so I'm using jQuery.ajax with datatype script to load some scripts, but when they error, the error is "Script error on line 0" by the time it gets to window.onerror the right error shows in the console, but I'm trying to diagnose errors only my users are seeing so this is a proble,
[16:30:42] <failbot> *problem
[16:30:44] <Violinist> and wants to make sure my code is purfect
[16:30:55] <taplar> failbot: can you show us an example of your issue?
[16:31:00] <Violinist> bbl
[16:31:10] <da_wunder> Violinist: just trying to help you, nothing else
[16:31:23] <failbot> taplar just a sec
[16:32:16] <failbot> taplar can i pm you?
[16:32:27] <taplar> i'd prefer you ask/communicate in the room
[16:32:34] <failbot> i need to give a url
[16:33:14] <failbot> :/
[16:33:23] <taplar> if you're hesitant about giving out a url to the public, pm'ing it to a random stranger isn't much better, ;)
[16:33:33] <failbot> yeah...
[16:33:37] <failbot> damnit
[16:37:55] <taplar> anyway, so you are using ajax to load other scripts?
[16:39:24] <taplar> ah, he left
[16:39:25] <JrWebDev> $('.myTables').on('click','tr', function() {var id = $(this).attr('data-value'); $('#myTRdataValue').val(id) } ...how do i tell to refresh the page and load the value from my TR data-value???
[16:39:41] <JrWebDev> when i click on a table row
[16:40:03] <taplar> window.reload() will refresh the page
[16:40:26] <taplar> you'd have to store whatever information you want to persist in some manner that can be accessed after the refresh
[16:40:27] <JrWebDev> taplar, with the data??
[16:41:29] <robertmaxrees> JrWebDev just setting a value won't do anything with it.
[16:41:40] <robertmaxrees> so when you reload the page, it'll be whatever it was before.
[16:43:09] <taplar> is this related to your question, i think it was you, the other day about manipulating the window url?
[16:43:52] <taplar> someone was wanting to change ?x=abc to ?y=abc or something
[16:45:49] * taplar sees that there is 2:15 to go...
[20:50:51] <jonez> greetings
[20:51:39] <jonez> I am having some trouble with a $.ajax() call -- it does not call always() or done() or any other methods. help? :)
[22:24:56] <jonez> greetings
