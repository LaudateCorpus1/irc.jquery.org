[01:31:19] <jak2000> hi all
[01:34:37] <jak2000> anyone here used cordova + jquery mobile? any link for learn?
[01:52:34] <doekia> @jak2000, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkuN2JIRnEY (in french sorry)
[01:53:24] <doekia> anyone here mastering await, arrow, promise ?
[02:00:07] <bestdesign> hi all :)
[02:00:33] <jak2000> doekia thanks
[07:28:44] <bestdesign> hey all
[07:29:06] <bestdesign> how can select from a option with jquery from a select html?
[07:29:25] <Cork> select dom element you mean?
[07:29:25] <bestdesign> ('#test').prop('selected', true);
[07:29:33] <bestdesign> this not want to do
[07:29:52] <bestdesign> an option inside select from html
[07:29:59] <Cork> $('select option[id="something"]').prop('selected', true)
[07:30:18] <bestdesign> well i have an id in option
[07:30:22] <bestdesign> that is bad way?
[07:30:27] <Cork> or simply $('select').val('something');
[07:30:29] <Cork> opps
[07:30:38] <Cork> i meant $('select option[value="something"]').prop('selected', true)
[07:30:50] <Cork> if you don't have a multi select i recommend .val()
[07:31:06] <bestdesign> is single one
[07:31:18] <Cork> then just select the select element and set the .val()
[07:32:35] <bestdesign> i wil ltry thx
[07:35:07] <bestdesign> well above code works just wonder the option tag not works with id?
[07:36:45] <bestdesign> is eq(1); is also an option for select right?
[07:36:58] <bestdesign> find('option:eq(0)')
[07:43:01] <bestdesign> well is seems works too
[08:22:09] <bestdesign> helloBtn.addEventListener( "click", function( event ) {    alert( "Hello." );}, false );
[08:22:16] <bestdesign> what means false at the end?
[08:25:07] <FilipNortic> that's js not jQuery
[08:26:41] <bestdesign> well just read learn page
[08:27:00] <bestdesign> but not talk about that one
[08:28:27] <FilipNortic> which learn page? jQeurys?
[08:28:38] <bestdesign> yeah learn.jquery.com
[08:28:58] <FilipNortic> cause that is plain js... jQuery uses .on() for events
[08:29:58] <FilipNortic> which in turn calls addEventListetener
[08:31:01] <bestdesign> $( "#list" ).on( "click", "a[href^='http']", function( event ) {    $( this ).attr( "target", "_blank" );});
[08:31:30] <bestdesign> this one will work with #list id click and also on a tag http start with?
[08:32:59] <bestdesign> i mean what i set after .on
[08:35:24] <FilipNortic> that function attaches an eventhandler to the elment with id=list, and it listens for clicks on all children element that matches your  a[href^='http'] selctor and if found it runns the given function
[08:35:55] <bestdesign> oh got it
[08:35:59] <bestdesign> thanks
[08:36:45] <bestdesign> basicly before use .find is there need to set .parent()? as I want to search in parents form that elements or matter?
[08:36:57] <bestdesign> I see both used and not used
[08:37:08] <bestdesign> both works
[09:09:48] <robertparkerx> how do I trigger a scroll function? jQuery(window).scroll(function() { });
[09:13:52] <FilipNortic> by scrolling in browser? don't think it works on mobile tho
[09:14:26] <FilipNortic> robertparkerx: try putting console.log("scrolling") inside the function and see
[09:14:32] <robertparkerx> can I trigger on page load
[09:15:57] <FilipNortic>  that would make no sense
[09:16:14] <FilipNortic> scroll is an eventhandler not a function doing scrolling
[09:16:43] <FilipNortic> it's short for .on("scroll", function(){});
[09:17:58] <FilipNortic> if you want to run the function on page load then just put a named function in your a  .on("scroll", function(){doOnScroll()}); and run that on pageload
[09:20:09] <FilipNortic> robertparkerx: what is it you accually want to do?
[09:20:17] <FilipNortic> scoll the page when it loads?
[10:45:51] <bestdesign> $('#test li:eq(1)'); is same as $('#test li').eq(1); only the difference is the speed?
[10:58:26] <bestdesign> .is(':invalid')
[10:58:31] <bestdesign> is possible to select other way?
[11:02:04] <AdamPDotty> hmm, eq in CSS starts with 1, right? in jQuery with 0
[11:03:12] <bestdesign> yes
[11:03:17] <bestdesign> all order from 0
[11:03:21] <bestdesign> as I know
[11:03:37] <bestdesign> in jQuery
[11:03:38] <AdamPDotty> .is() does not select
[11:04:00] <bestdesign> I use .is to display valid or not valid status
[11:04:21] <bestdesign> I think about .prop but with that cant select that i am sure?
[11:05:02] <AdamPDotty> display sounds like CSS
[11:08:47] <FilipNortic> can't see how that would work unless valid and invaild are jQuery psudo-selctors.. :visible works
[11:08:49] <bestdesign> how can select that with eq: to select only from 4 to 7?
[11:09:09] <bestdesign> before eq:s not
[11:10:03] <FilipNortic> well there won't be a nice selector for every case you can possibly think of
[11:10:27] <FilipNortic> sometimes you have to write your own filter functions and such
[11:11:18] <bestdesign> there have an untill selector?
[11:11:28] <bestdesign> like -1 is the last?
[11:11:56] <bestdesign> something for .not hm
[11:40:33] <jak2000> hi all
[11:51:46] <bestdesign> to get number of chidren is
[11:51:51] <bestdesign> ('#test').children().queue().length;
[11:51:58] <bestdesign> queue is needed?
[12:02:45] <Woet> bestdesign: try it?
[12:14:45] <bestdesign> Woet basicly .length is count also
[12:16:01] <robertmaxrees> queue is not needed.
[12:16:10] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what queue does?
[12:25:09] <bestdesign> not really read learn.jquery.com
[12:25:17] <bestdesign> but not got it ;\
[12:25:42] <robertmaxrees> or read the docs.
[12:25:43] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[12:25:48] <robertmaxrees> "Show or manipulate the queue of functions to be executed on the matched elements."
[12:26:10] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what that means?
[12:26:38] <bestdesign> is about something function order step?
[12:27:31] <robertmaxrees> if you read that entire page, you'd understand what queues are.
[12:27:42] <robertmaxrees> you don't need a queue to use .length, as it's not a function.  it's a property.
[12:29:26] <bestdesign> I do now thanks
[12:30:44] <bestdesign> still is a good idea to set with [data-test] for events from jquery other than id or class?
[12:49:00] <bestdesign> to be more clear?oh
[12:49:07] <bestdesign> well
[12:49:08] <bestdesign> !
[12:49:17] <bestdesign> http://api.jquery.com/queue/ is about to change the value?
[12:49:34] <bestdesign> for length in example?
[12:49:39] <bestdesign> and display
[12:55:03] <Dannyboy84> quick jquery question please
[12:55:05] <Dannyboy84> $("tr:contains('day')").css("background-color", "red");
[12:55:23] <Dannyboy84> that works, but how do I change the css to apply to the body background rather than the tr background?
[12:57:09] <robertmaxrees> bestdesign make a fiddle, show us what you're trying to do.
[12:57:32] <robertmaxrees> the body of the page or...?
[12:57:41] <Dannyboy84> the body of the page
[12:57:47] <Dannyboy84> body background-color
[12:58:01] <robertmaxrees> $('body').css('background-color', 'red')???
[12:58:15] <robertmaxrees> or do you want the page to only change color if a tr contains "day"?
[12:58:21] <Dannyboy84> yup
[12:58:29] <Dannyboy84> only change color if a tr contains day
[12:59:05] <robertmaxrees> simple if - check if $("tr:contains('day')").length is greater then 1 and go to town.
[12:59:42] <Dannyboy84> sorry I mean the word day
[12:59:52] <Dannyboy84> lets for example replace day with balloons
[12:59:54] <robertmaxrees> use a filter on tr
[13:00:03] <robertmaxrees> or make a fiddle so we can havea  real example ;)
[13:00:47] <Dannyboy84> $("tr:contains('balloons')").css("background-color", "red");
[13:00:58] <robertmaxrees> yeah, mind making a fiddle?
[13:01:03] <Dannyboy84> will do now
[13:01:07] <robertmaxrees> rad
[13:01:57] <robertmaxrees> brb
[13:04:07] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees queue can addClass inside in running animation
[13:04:13] <bestdesign> i got this from demo :D
[13:04:17] <robertmaxrees> ok?
[13:08:23] <bestdesign> in queue demo page do that
[13:08:44] <robertmaxrees> are you asking a question or....
[13:08:44] <bestdesign> change animation inside like addclass
[13:08:48] <bestdesign> ask
[13:08:57] <robertmaxrees> okay, show me a fiddle and ask your question.
[13:09:07] <bestdesign> like from red to blue and inside it change color to yellow?
[13:09:11] <bestdesign> okey
[13:09:50] <Dannyboy84> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/48s5r2jw/
[13:10:13] <robertmaxrees> oh fwiw you don't use html or body tags in jsfiddle :)
[13:10:42] <Dannyboy84> ok
[13:11:07] <robertmaxrees> okay so your first question is "is there a tr that contains the text "balloons"
[13:11:09] <robertmaxrees> "
[13:11:46] <robertmaxrees> luckily, there's a handy swiss-army knife method that'll do all sorts of things like this.  it's called "filter"
[13:12:08] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[13:12:36] <robertmaxrees> i'd use that with a function, then check the length of the return.  if it's greater than 0, set the background color.
[13:12:54] <Dannyboy84> yes but the page will have 100s of other words
[13:13:00] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[13:13:02] <robertmaxrees> and?
[13:13:17] <robertmaxrees> are you checking for other terms or...?
[13:13:30] <Dannyboy84> nope just checking for one word on the page
[13:13:41] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change my suggestion then.
[13:13:44] <Dannyboy84> ok
[13:14:54] <robertmaxrees> here have a freebie
[13:14:55] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zwdg4jc1/4/
[13:15:24] <Dannyboy84> thank you that works great :D
[13:17:35] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees i have following code https://paste.ee/p/gPqpV on multiple lines about click to scroll it above an elements i wonder how I can make it as a function? to not repeat again and again?
[13:17:54] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[13:17:58] <robertmaxrees> show me a better example.
[13:18:11] <bestdesign> a second okey
[13:18:26] <robertmaxrees> showing me an isolated, singular instance and then talking about how you repeat it isn't helpful.
[13:18:29] <robertmaxrees> needs more context.
[13:21:43] <robertmaxrees> https://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions for some great guidelines of how to ask good questions.
[13:31:04] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/y4unxp5m/
[13:31:21] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:31:24] <bestdesign> how can i less time repeat the scrollTop? have some way to use as in function and do it with one line or?
[13:32:25] <robertmaxrees> so first of all - just store the function in a var and then use that:https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/t5w7dqbv/1/
[13:32:35] <robertmaxrees> but also: learn how to use classes.
[13:33:13] <bestdesign> wow!
[13:33:17] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/t5w7dqbv/4/
[13:33:18] <bestdesign> what a logic :))))))))
[13:33:20] <Dannyboy84> robertmaxrees, if I add a z to "balloons" it still triggers the background to be red, I assume I have to put white space after balloons in the jquery to prevent that?
[13:33:24] <bestdesign> thank you robertmaxrees
[13:34:05] <bestdesign> ^^
[13:34:05] <robertmaxrees> Dannyboy84 an you show me a more indicative example of what the actual table would look like?
[13:34:27] <robertmaxrees> i'd winder if you want a regex with word boundaries or something else.
[13:34:31] <robertmaxrees> *wonder
[13:35:02] <Dannyboy84> the word I am targeting is "new"
[13:35:13] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i'm asking.
[13:35:20] <robertmaxrees> would new be alone in a td?
[13:35:24] <Dannyboy84> sadly that word could likely appear in within other words
[13:35:40] <robertmaxrees> is it in a sentence?  what if it's at the end of a sentence, next to a period?
[13:35:42] <Dannyboy84> well another td might have newspaper
[13:36:15] <robertmaxrees> right, but adding spaces next to it in that indexOf would miss cases like "this sentence has something new."
[13:36:19] <Dannyboy84> the word I am targeting is just new, all alone not part of a sentence
[13:36:29] <robertmaxrees> so a TD that contains only the word new?
[13:36:32] <Dannyboy84> yes
[13:37:07] <robertmaxrees> okay - so go back to the filter - there are 2 tweaks to make.
[13:37:29] <Dannyboy84> var $trsWithText = $('tr').filter(function() {
[13:37:32] <Dannyboy84> that part?
[13:37:36] <robertmaxrees> you don't care of a TR contains the word new, you contain if any td's text is equal to 'new'
[13:37:44] <robertmaxrees> $('tr') will need to change
[13:37:56] <robertmaxrees> since you don't actually care about 'tr', you care about td
[13:38:17] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees $('html,body').stop().animate({    scrollTop: $('#test4').offset().top  }, 1000, 'linear');
[13:38:30] <bestdesign> .stop before ,animation is needed i saw wit hthat in snippets?
[13:38:38] <bestdesign> with that*
[13:38:40] <robertmaxrees> bestdesign that's not a question
[13:38:54] <robertmaxrees> are you asking why people use stop()?
[13:39:06] <bestdesign> yes before .animation
[13:39:12] <bestdesign> on smooth scrool
[13:39:34] <robertmaxrees> try removing it and click on your links multiple times in rapid succession.
[13:40:12] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/stop/ explains what it's used for.
[13:41:23] <robertmaxrees> Dannyboy84 still with me? :)
[13:41:26] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees with inside var definied variables not work outside in a function right?
[13:41:38] <robertmaxrees> bestdesign are you even trying to google first?
[13:41:44] <bestdesign> like .on click
[13:41:46] <bestdesign> sorry i do
[13:41:53] <robertmaxrees> js 101
[13:42:13] <Dannyboy84> yup
[13:42:23] <robertmaxrees> Dannyboy84 so did you make the tweaks?
[13:42:53] <Dannyboy84> working on it
[13:43:06] <robertmaxrees> stuck?
[13:43:11] <Dannyboy84> yup lol
[13:43:20] <robertmaxrees> show me what you've got so far :)
[13:44:39] <bestdesign> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/t5w7dqbv/1/ in this there have a way to change the test4 id somehow? I mean not be pre definied?
[13:44:55] <robertmaxrees> bestdesign not sure I follow.
[13:45:06] <robertmaxrees> you mean for each link?
[13:45:15] <robertmaxrees> like, are you trying to scroll to a diofferent location for each one
[13:45:16] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:45:36] <bestdesign> $('#test4').offset().top
[13:45:39] <bestdesign> yes change test4
[13:45:53] <bestdesign> in on click ?
[13:46:09] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to change the ID?
[13:46:31] <bestdesign> well i use it on many clicks and different elements offset.top
[13:46:36] <bestdesign> not same all
[13:46:49] <robertmaxrees> so then update your fiddle to be a better example of what you wanbt.
[13:47:15] <Dannyboy84> I think I got it working robertmaxrees
[13:47:23] <robertmaxrees> mind showing me? :)
[13:47:26] <robertmaxrees> Dannyboy84
[13:47:33] <Dannyboy84> https://jsfiddle.net/ho9typL8/
[13:47:44] <robertmaxrees> :D
[13:47:46] <robertmaxrees> ace.
[13:47:53] <Dannyboy84> wow I am amazed lol
[13:47:54] <robertmaxrees> 2 nitpicks.
[13:47:54] <Dannyboy84> cheers
[13:48:06] <bestdesign> https://jsfiddle.net/h4d0oftx/
[13:48:10] <robertmaxrees> 1 - use === instead of ==.
[13:48:15] <robertmaxrees> and 2 - whgy are you doing .closest()????
[13:48:55] <robertmaxrees> bestdesign so instead of changing the function for each one like that, really you just want a way to connect a link to a section.
[13:49:19] <bestdesign> yes
[13:49:22] <bestdesign> something like that
[13:49:31] <robertmaxrees> *exactly like that ;)
[13:49:37] <bestdesign> I able to set where id to scroll
[13:49:44] <robertmaxrees> data attributes are handy for things like this.
[13:50:05] <robertmaxrees> although actually, just the href attribute is all you want.
[13:50:19] <bestdesign> yes
[13:50:37] <robertmaxrees> so backing up
[13:50:59] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/75fckwxb/4/
[13:51:05] <robertmaxrees> let's start with this example.
[13:51:22] <robertmaxrees> (i know you want to animate the scroll - just stick with me for a sec.
[13:52:15] <robertmaxrees> see the example?
[13:52:21] <bestdesign> oh that logic!
[13:52:29] <robertmaxrees> so now.
[13:52:36] <robertmaxrees> you want to animate that instead, right?
[13:53:01] <bestdesign> yes to be smooth
[13:53:24] <bestdesign> is now works with id and and a link href hmm im thinking
[13:53:37] <robertmaxrees> try adding back in your handler.
[13:53:48] <robertmaxrees> but bind to $('.scroll-to-section') instead.
[13:54:30] <bestdesign> so that means work on that class?
[13:54:52] <robertmaxrees> yes, that's what "bind to $('.scroll-to-section') instead." means
[13:55:01] <robertmaxrees> as in, $('.scroll-to-section').on('click', scrollTheBody);
[13:56:19] <bestdesign> a moment
[13:57:28] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[13:57:42] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees but not got this how can set to scroll test5? https://jsfiddle.net/5skL3bpn/
[13:57:55] <robertmaxrees> that's the next step :)
[13:58:09] <bestdesign> im thinking hmm
[13:58:28] <robertmaxrees> notice how we already have id="#test5" or id="#test4" on those links?
[13:58:58] <bestdesign> well for example different id yes
[13:59:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:59:05] <bestdesign> but i have input and form elements
[13:59:11] <robertmaxrees> chill - slow down.
[13:59:13] <robertmaxrees> one thing at a time.
[13:59:21] <robertmaxrees> so - wouldn't it be rad if you could get that ID?
[13:59:31] <robertmaxrees> out of the href, i mean.
[13:59:52] <robertmaxrees> (stick with me here)
[14:00:03] <bestdesign> yes
[14:00:04] <bestdesign> a moment
[14:00:17] <robertmaxrees> luckily for you, .prop() exists - http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[14:00:35] <bestdesign> #form_touch
[14:00:40] <robertmaxrees> stop.
[14:00:43] <robertmaxrees> back to the fiddle first.
[14:00:51] <bestdesign> okey
[14:00:52] <robertmaxrees> don't muddy the waters yet.
[14:01:17] <robertmaxrees> you can pass .prop() the name of the prop and it'll return that prop's value.  think of props as being the js way top access attributes, a.k.a. href="#test5"
[14:01:45] <bestdesign> (this).prop?
[14:01:47] <robertmaxrees> so, how would you use .prop() to get the value of that href?
[14:02:02] <bestdesign> :o
[14:02:08] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:02:18] <bestdesign> $(this).prop?
[14:02:39] <robertmaxrees> close - but you  pass .prop() the name of the prop
[14:02:39] <robertmaxrees> and
[14:02:53] <robertmaxrees> *and it'll tell you what the value is
[14:03:18] <robertmaxrees> .prop doesn't tell you anything - if's a method - you need to pass the name of the prop you want.
[14:03:58] <robertmaxrees> where am i losing you?
[14:04:04] <bestdesign> hmm thinking but
[14:04:10] <robertmaxrees> it's very, very simple./
[14:04:20] <robertmaxrees> how do you call most other jquery features?
[14:04:21] <bestdesign> with data-?
[14:04:26] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:04:33] <robertmaxrees> not with data.  you're using .prop()
[14:04:55] <bestdesign> prop('checked', true);
[14:05:00] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[14:05:01] <bestdesign> whati use to check checkbox
[14:05:05] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[14:05:17] <bestdesign> from this how get value not idea
[14:05:17] <robertmaxrees> so how would you get the value of href using prop?
[14:05:32] <bestdesign> hmm
[14:05:36] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/prop/#prop-propertyName
[14:05:48] <robertmaxrees> it's a function - you pass it the name of the property you want.
[14:06:31] <bestdesign> Description: Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements.
[14:06:36] <robertmaxrees> you've passed things into functions many times.
[14:06:57] <robertmaxrees> do you know what i mean when i say "pass it the name of the property"?
[14:07:12] <bestdesign> something like
[14:07:20] <bestdesign> $(this).prop('propname')
[14:07:22] <bestdesign> ?
[14:07:24] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^^^
[14:07:27] <robertmaxrees> yesssss
[14:07:40] <bestdesign> :o
[14:07:47] <MassDebates> wait so attr is bad now?
[14:07:56] <MassDebates> Didn't know that. Huh, TIL.
[14:08:01] <bestdesign> well for href is attr?
[14:08:05] <robertmaxrees> i would avoid .attr() and preper .prop() for most cases.
[14:08:55] <bestdesign> :)
[14:08:58] <bestdesign> attr is for href
[14:09:10] <bestdesign> smooth scroll breaks with prop
[14:09:33] <robertmaxrees> actually, in this one case, attr() wouild make more sense since you want the explicit value of the attribute and not thje value prop has.  fair point.
[14:09:59] <bestdesign>     scrollTop: $(this).prop('').offset().top
[14:10:16] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[14:10:21] <bestdesign> umm
[14:10:25] <robertmaxrees> dude
[14:11:00] <bestdesign> bestdesign: $(this).prop('href')
[14:11:01] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/attributes/
[14:11:02] <bestdesign> ?
[14:11:21] <robertmaxrees> i actually corrected myself and clarified you were right - you should use .attr() here instead.
[14:11:24] <robertmaxrees> that was my bad.
[14:11:54] <MassDebates> robertmaxrees, if I have <a class="example-com-link link external --budge --budgegen2" id="nsd3iusns" "href="example.com">Example.com</a>
[14:12:12] <bestdesign> okey attr
[14:12:17] <MassDebates> What's the difference between .prop() on one of the attrs and .attr() on one of the attrs ?
[14:12:19] <MassDebates> like href for example
[14:12:35] <bestdesign> https://jsfiddle.net/90xqhv4c/
[14:12:46] <bestdesign> but some reason not work oh my goooooooood
[14:12:53] <robertmaxrees> bestdesign because you have more to do.
[14:12:59] <robertmaxrees> $(this).attr('href') returns a string.
[14:13:04] <MassDebates> right
[14:13:06] <robertmaxrees> you need to then use that string to select the ID you want.
[14:13:24] <MassDebates> I guess I can just make a fiddle and TIAS
[14:13:38] <bestdesign> well is ok to use but how :o
[14:13:50] <bestdesign> string to id hm
[14:13:59] <robertmaxrees> MassDebates https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qjxnem5z/1/
[14:14:18] <robertmaxrees> bestdesign so first - store the result of that .attr() to a variable.
[14:14:52] <bestdesign>   var id = $(this).attr('href'); ?
[14:15:05] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[14:15:08] <robertmaxrees> start there.
[14:15:33] <bestdesign> :)
[14:15:45] <robertmaxrees> now, think about how you use $() - ever notice how you often pass it strings?
[14:16:19] <bestdesign>     scrollTop: $(id).offset().top
[14:16:20] <bestdesign> ?
[14:16:22] <robertmaxrees> no
[14:16:25] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[14:16:25] <robertmaxrees> yes
[14:16:29] <robertmaxrees> hahaha sorry - misread that.
[14:16:31] <robertmaxrees> well done.
[14:16:34] <bestdesign> :-)
[14:16:39] <bestdesign> you are a PRO :)
[14:16:44] <robertmaxrees> when i can read ;)
[14:16:46] <robertmaxrees> but now.
[14:16:53] <robertmaxrees> you might notice a little glitch with that logic.,
[14:17:31] <bestdesign> https://jsfiddle.net/90xqhv4c/1/
[14:17:40] <bestdesign> glitch?
[14:18:06] <robertmaxrees> some browsers might jump down to the div and then animate
[14:18:13] <robertmaxrees> so i'd pop in a preventDefault()
[14:18:22] <bestdesign> oh yes!
[14:18:32] <robertmaxrees> and you forgot your .stop() ;)
[14:18:34] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees thank you soooo soo much to help appreciated!!
[14:18:42] <bestdesign> you are rock :P
[14:18:54] <robertmaxrees> sure - now go read through learn.jquery.com ;)
[14:19:59] <bestdesign> https://jsfiddle.net/90xqhv4c/3/ WAAAAAA!!! works like a charmp :)
[14:20:14] <bestdesign> powered by robertmaxrees ^^
[14:20:35] <gambl0re> hello?
[14:20:52] <bestdesign> hi

[14:20:59] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:23:08] <bestdesign> ^^
[14:23:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:23:31] <robertmaxrees> looks like connection problems.
[14:23:40] <bestdesign> yes slow net
[14:24:59] <bestdesign> is makes my code much cleaner :)
[14:25:05] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[14:26:19] <bestdesign> gambl0re net problems?
[14:40:56] <gambl0re> bestdesign, what?
[14:41:19] <bestdesign> gambl0re you leave before your net connection?
[14:53:07] <gambl0re> what?
[14:56:52] <robertmaxrees> think he's asking why you were connecting and disconnecting.
[15:14:02] <bestdesign> brb
[15:21:11] <gambl0re> hey robert
[15:21:15] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:21:20] <gambl0re> hows going?
[15:21:23] <robertmaxrees> it goes.
[15:21:39] <gambl0re> hows work?
[15:21:50] <robertmaxrees> it's work
[15:21:56] <gambl0re> lots of meetings?
[15:22:02] <robertmaxrees> yep
[15:22:08] <gambl0re> that sucks
[15:22:16] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[15:22:27] <gambl0re> why?
[15:22:38] <robertmaxrees> because it's apart of my job.  not all meetings are bad.
[15:23:19] <gambl0re> i see
[15:35:41] <jak2000> meetings about?
[15:35:46] <jak2000> programming?
[15:35:48] <robertmaxrees> lots of stuff.
[15:36:33] <robertmaxrees> i have 1:1s with my employees, daily standup, cross-team check-ins, strategy sessions, planning sessions...
[16:07:55] <gambl0re> robert works at a large company
[16:12:00] <robertmaxrees> welp
[16:20:33] <royalty> yeah i've seen robert before looking all smug, eating all the apples in the community kitchen
[16:20:38] <royalty> won't even leave me an apple
[16:20:42] <royalty> i've complained to HR
[16:20:44] <robertmaxrees> lolwut
[16:21:01] <royalty> lol jk
[16:21:07] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[16:24:54] <royalty> yeah that robert guy i've seen him around, hugging all his coworkers, i try to avoid him because of that, avoid the big bear hug he gives with a smile
[16:25:06] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[16:25:13] <robertmaxrees> 'kay now it's just kinda weird.
[16:25:14] <royalty> i see him strolling towards me and then i walk away in the other direction
[16:25:53] <royalty> I'm followed around the office but then I turn around and see him smiling, I scream at the top of my lungs and then I realized I was just dreaming
[16:26:00] <royalty> phew
[16:33:52] <royalty> ok without the creepy stuff i'm having trouble with something silly
[16:33:54] <royalty> {"error":null,"content":null,"success":true}
[16:34:02] <royalty> this is an object
[16:34:18] <royalty> for some reason when i try object.success i'm getting undefined
[16:34:18] <robertmaxrees> ok
[16:34:31] <robertmaxrees> guessing you're getting that in an ajax response?
[16:34:35] <royalty> yeah heh
[16:35:11] <robertmaxrees> typeof whateverThatObjectIsCalled - you'll probably get string.
[16:35:15] <royalty> https://gist.github.com/Modicrumb/20a489440981ca432ea12f5a9eb1e4bb
[16:35:21] <royalty> heh ok
[16:36:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah. console.log(typeof data) in that success handler - you'll get string.  need to JSON.parse() the response
[16:36:17] <robertmaxrees> var parsedData = JSON.parse(data);
[16:36:24] <robertmaxrees> parsedData will now be what you're expectiong.
[16:36:48] <royalty> oh man, also can i just set dataType to json
[16:36:52] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:36:57] <royalty> i've run into this multiple times
[16:37:00] <robertmaxrees> not the same thing.
[16:37:13] <royalty> anyway i'm expecting json response so i think in this case i could
[16:37:17] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:37:22] <robertmaxrees> you're expecting a string response.
[16:37:30] <robertmaxrees> dataType doesn't convert anything.
[16:37:36] <royalty> hmph
[16:37:40] <robertmaxrees> so leave it be/.
[16:37:43] <robertmaxrees> also: what version of jquery are you using?
[16:38:10] <royalty> let me see
[16:38:29] <robertmaxrees> can just type in $.fn.jquery in your dev tools.
[16:38:31] <robertmaxrees> it'll tell you.
[16:38:40] <robertmaxrees> unless $ isn't globally accessible.
[16:38:51] <royalty> 2.1.4
[16:39:19] <robertmaxrees> should be able to use .then() instead there.
[16:40:30] <royalty>         dataType: 'json' worked, heh
[16:40:45] <robertmaxrees> that's not doing what you think it's doing.
[16:40:57] <royalty> doesn't it have something to do with headers?
[16:41:10] <robertmaxrees> that means either your server's headers are wrong, or something else is busted.
[16:41:17] <robertmaxrees> feel free to correct your headers if you'd like.
[16:41:21] <royalty> nah, i think my server listens for that
[16:41:26] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:41:26] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:41:31] <robertmaxrees> dataType is not sent as apart of the request.
[16:41:36] <robertmaxrees> only the response.
[16:42:22] <royalty> i should be responding with the headers that specify it's json though, hmph
[16:42:29] <robertmaxrees> then fix your headers.
[16:42:30] <royalty> let me see i can see that in console right
[16:42:30] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/j259D9I.png
[16:42:57] <robertmaxrees> and swap to using .then() instead of success to make later updates easier :)
[16:45:01] <royalty> Request: Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01
[16:45:15] <royalty> Response: Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
[16:45:19] <royalty> isn't that correct?
[16:45:26] <robertmaxrees> what's your actual raw response?
[16:45:40] <royalty> {"error":null,"content":null,"success":true}
[16:45:50] <robertmaxrees> hit it with curl.
[16:46:41] <robertmaxrees> also: fwiw i think you might be conflating concepts :)(
[16:46:44] <robertmaxrees> * :)
[16:46:47] <royalty> probably :(
[16:47:38] <royalty> okay let me try without dataType: 'json'
[16:48:09] <robertmaxrees> using JSON.parse() is an OK thing to do
[16:50:14] <royalty> so my response headers are listenting for my request headers
[16:50:19] <royalty> Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
[16:50:22] <royalty> this is the response
[16:50:39] <royalty> my request headers are no longer json
[16:51:14] <royalty> I think it's a part of the "magic" of the framework I'm using
[16:51:34] <robertmaxrees> what's the framework?
[16:51:41] <royalty> CakePHP3.x
[16:51:45] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[16:53:28] <royalty> i'll look into .then() though
[16:53:33] <royalty> thanks for the help
[16:53:41] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty easy.
[16:53:51] <robertmaxrees> instead of success: function() {}
[16:54:21] <robertmaxrees> do $.ajax(/* your stuff here */).then(function(data) { console.log(data) });
[16:54:44] <royalty> okay awesome i don't mind making that change at all
