[00:45:05] <robertmaxrees> with some extra effort you should be able to get the last need bit
[00:45:09] <robertmaxrees> *needed
[00:45:56] <aro> where is draggableParent in the html
[00:46:24] <robertmaxrees> you can ignore that.
[00:46:27] <robertmaxrees> it's commented out.
[00:46:37] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0me5wan1/14/
[00:47:23] <aro> one thing about mine is it is one directional
[00:47:28] <aro> the source list is draggable
[00:47:30] <aro> not sortable
[00:47:30] <robertmaxrees> jfc

[00:47:32] <robertmaxrees> dude
[00:47:37] <robertmaxrees> you can make all these little tweaks.
[00:47:41] <robertmaxrees> i'm just showing you the basics.
[00:47:49] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to do it all for you :)
[00:47:54] <aro> i need it completed with full documentation

[00:49:02] * aro waits
[00:49:08] <aro> i am just tired
[00:49:17] <aro> i did something like this YEARS ago
[00:49:32] <aro> And I don't have that code anymore and i am kicking myself for not keeping it
[00:50:13] <aro> i really do not use jqui much
[00:50:43] <robertmaxrees> most folks don't these days.
[00:50:48] <robertmaxrees> at least not for new projects.
[00:51:53] <aro> what do they use now
[00:52:03] <robertmaxrees> react, angular, vue, riot...
[00:52:05] <aro> i am not an interaction designer by trade
[00:52:08] <aro> i hate angular
[00:52:11] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[00:52:21] <robertmaxrees> neither am i lol
[00:52:21] <aro> i got sucked into learning that and i want to claw my eyes out
[00:52:26] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[00:52:33] <robertmaxrees> well either way, most folks aren't using jqui any more.
[00:52:41] <aro> is it still being developed?
[00:52:44] <robertmaxrees> i'd pick any of the dozens of frontend frameworks and go with that.
[00:52:57] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui
[00:53:09] <aro> wow
[00:53:10] <aro> a while then
[00:53:22] <aro> i remember the night jquery 2 was released
[00:53:31] <aro> i remember the night jquery 1.0 was released
[22:01:49] <MACscr> krajee has a pretty nice fileinput plugin for upload management and a bunch of other decent stuff. I implemented it into a project a couple years ago. Im trying to though see if there is a way to run a script when it creates a preview of a file. I creates a div with a class of 'file-preview-image'. My end goal is to replace a background image with that preview image. I know how to capture the img src, but how can i monitor that div
[22:01:49] <MACscr>  creation so that i know when to capture the img src?
[22:11:14] <MACscr> nvm, i found an event that they had that i can tie into
