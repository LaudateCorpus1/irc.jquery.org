[02:51:22] <xenaxon> hello
[02:51:29] <xenaxon> need some help
[02:51:31] <xenaxon> gyu
[02:51:51] <xenaxon> anybody know how to work arrays in Mustache JS ?
[02:53:00] <xenaxon> i need to plot a table, and i have rows, and columns.
[02:53:37] <xenaxon> i know how to display an array in mustache but how to create multiple rows depending on the number I give it
[04:50:03] <Unbeerable> Hi. I have a question about deferred.always() behavior. Can I be sure the always() is always running *after* .done() and .fail() to make things which are common for those methods?
[04:51:29] <Cork> Unbeerable: it at least used to be, but give me a min to make sure
[04:55:18] <Cork> hmm interesting it actually doesn't look that way
[04:58:51] <Cork> Unbeerable: https://jsfiddle.net/mh7pa7wL/
[04:58:57] <Cork> no, they are called in binding order
[04:59:42] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/mh7pa7wL/1/
[04:59:55] <Cork> Unbeerable: so always is NOT always called last
[05:20:10] <Unbeerable> Cork, but it always called last, if specified last?
[05:20:22] <Cork> yes
[05:20:31] <Cork> as you can see from the testcase
[05:20:38] <Unbeerable> that's definitely enought for me, thank you
[05:20:43] <Unbeerable> *enough
[06:36:27] <sigdk> I'm not sure how to mock the ajax, nevertheless... is there something wrong with the logic of this snippet https://jsfiddle.net/hbezwsvb/2/ ?
[06:44:56] <ranjithbluebird> join
[07:13:21] <Cork> sigdk: yes, ajax is async so the return value will always be null
[07:14:06] <Cork> (execution order is line 5, 13, 9 or 11)
[07:18:45] <Cork> sigdk: i would recommend this structure: https://jsfiddle.net/hbezwsvb/3/
[07:44:59] <sigdk> Cork, is this synchronous: ("#foobar").html("Hello World!"); and this asynchronous: $("#foobar").html(function(){ return "Hello World!"});   ?
[07:45:41] <Cork> sigdk: yes
[07:45:50] <Cork> both are syncronous
[07:46:14] <Cork> setTimeout, setInterval and $.ajax is what makes things async
[07:46:20] <Cork> (there are a few more)
[07:47:29] <FilipNortic> async basicly implies that you are unsure of the execution order
[07:49:19] <FilipNortic> and I read the conversation worng again sorry about that
[07:50:34] <Cork> FilipNortic: well it is quite true though
[07:50:41] <Cork> though there are things you always know about async calls
[07:51:00] <Cork> it will NEVER execute until the current javascript stack has completely unwinded
[07:51:27] <Cork> so a return in the js will ALWAYS run before any async callbacks, no matter how fast they are
[07:52:22] <Cork> sigdk: the solution i gave you uses deferred to make an async callback for the caller to get a similar effect of the return value you wanted to use
[07:52:44] <Cork> you could use .done().fail() out there instead if you prefer that
[07:54:08] <FilipNortic> back when I started working there were devs that used timeouts to try and make sure thier ajax calls finnished before execution of the statments. That kind of make you prefer sync requests
[07:55:12] <FilipNortic> btw that was in 2010 i'm not a js veteran
[07:55:30] <fuchstronaut> Cork: thanks for sharing that bit with the current stack, didn't knew that
[07:55:52] <Cork> FilipNortic: ya, i've seen a lot of racy code like that too
[07:56:08] <Cork> bit it mostly comes from ppl not knowing how async works and just hacking around it
[07:56:26] <Cork> and javascript developers has a weird love for setTimeout when things doesn't work >_>
[07:56:45] <Cork> (well and setInterval)
[07:56:53] <Cork> fuchstronaut: yw
[07:58:37] <FilipNortic> the only time I tried hack like that was typehead searches that fired to frequently but i think i gave up and redid backend instead
[08:01:40] <FilipNortic> things got wierd when older resluts finnished later than new ones... Are there good solutions to that?
[08:01:58] <Cork> the callbacks
[08:02:11] <Cork> they will always keep the relation to the request
[08:02:33] <Cork> if you are building a list from the results you need a placeholder for the specific content in the result list
[08:02:38] <Cork> so things can drop in out of order
[08:03:13] <Cork> cause ya, it is normal for http requests to resolve at different speed
[08:03:24] <Cork> for one cause of how fast the server can handle the specific request
[08:03:45] <Cork> but also for what route the package takes over the net based on load and route priority
[08:06:31] <sigdk> <Cork> you could use .done().fail() out there instead if you prefer that          may I ask you to modify it as such?
[08:07:05] <Cork> sigdk: just replace .always() with .done().fail()
[08:07:28] <Cork> .always is called in both cases, while .done .fail is called when it succeed/fail
[08:08:29] <FilipNortic> is always called after success()/fail() or in the order you put them?
[08:09:01] <Cork> heh i could answer that with scroll up as i answered that a little while back :)
[08:09:06] <Cork> it is in the order they are called
[08:09:27] <Cork> .always() is just a helper for .done(func).fail(func)
[08:09:34] <Cork> so it binds in the queue when you call it
[08:10:43] <sigdk> Cork, what does this line (7) mean:    .then(function() { return 'successs' }, function() { return 'fail'; });
[08:11:00] <Cork> sigdk: it sets the return value you use rel for before
[08:12:07] <FilipNortic> so if i put .always().done() it executed in that order?
[08:12:15] <Cork> yes
[08:12:30] <sigdk> Cork, why can't I use .done( return "success"; ).fail( return "fail"; ) there?
[08:12:54] <Cork> cause .done() and .fail() doesn't take return values
[08:13:01] <Cork> it doens't modify the deferred result value
[08:13:25] <Cork> the value returned in .then() is what becomes the first argument in following handlers
[08:13:49] <Cork> (the function(status <--) { .html(status); })
[08:14:56] <Cork> sigdk: note the return in the callbacks is not the same as the return in the getUsername function
[08:15:06] <Cork> it just modifies the deferred value chain
[08:15:24] <Cork> and is why the .always after getUsername() is needed
[08:45:54] <sigdk> Cork, what is the condition to return success or fail ?
[08:48:25] <Cork> sigdk: the ajax calls http status
[08:52:42] <sigdk> Cork, hmm... to be honest, I thought then was a replacement of done/fail but it's not just like that
[08:52:54] <Cork> sigdk: it is
[08:53:04] <Cork> kinda it is that and more
[08:53:26] <Cork> the first callback to .then is equal to done, and the second is equal to fail
[08:53:31] <sigdk> Cork, but you say that with done/fail I cannot return anything...
[08:53:50] <Cork> with the exception that what it returns is what the following deferred callbacks will reseave
[08:54:02] <Cork> sigdk: yes and that is the only difference
[08:54:23] <Cork> .then(function(data) { return data; }) is equal to .done(function(data) {})
[10:04:20] <Neo_122> hi guys
[10:04:37] <Neo_122> what better use yandex map or google map ?
[10:17:32] <Neo_122> you never listen about yandex ?
[10:28:52] <Uhkis> people probably dont know what yandex is
[10:29:08] <MassDebates> Of course people know what yandex is

[11:21:16] <Es0teric> how do you get the class from a element on click?
[11:21:22] <Es0teric> i dont want to check the class, i want to get the class
[11:22:56] <Woet> what did you try so far?
[11:25:34] <Uhkis> what's the difference between check and get?
[11:57:29] <quechon> hello guys im using this jquery extention http://www.fyneworks.com/jquery/multifile/
[11:57:37] <quechon> and materialize
[11:58:14] <quechon> but i cannot figure out how to make list of files appear in another div
[12:00:47] <quechon> https://bpaste.net/show/9568fbbab7e1 thats the html code using materialize.css
[13:39:00] <whoisaCe> Does async.js have a complete function?
[13:39:13] <whoisaCe> I don't seem to find one in the documentation https://caolan.github.io/async/docs.html
[13:39:23] <whoisaCe> oops wrong channel
[13:39:25] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:46:07] <whoisaCe> robertmaxrees - is there a way to find out when async completed with jquery? I tried ajaxStop and ajaxComplete, and neither return the console log :\
[13:46:21] <robertmaxrees> async as in...?
[13:46:34] <whoisaCe> the link I posted earlier
[13:46:46] <robertmaxrees> that's not jquery.
[13:46:58] <robertmaxrees> jquery offers its own mechanisms for that.
[13:51:43] <halftroll> how could I $.each through all [foo=foo] elements inside #foo ?
[13:51:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:51:59] <robertmaxrees> what is [foo=foo] supposed to represent?
[13:52:23] <robertmaxrees> halftroll you mean all elements with a given attribute?
[13:52:39] <halftroll> robertmaxrees: yes, that are inside a div with certain id
[13:52:50] <robertmaxrees> what's the attribute?
[13:52:57] <halftroll> for example <div id='foo'><div foo='foo'/></div>
[13:53:02] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:53:13] <robertmaxrees> you're not really supposed to create your own attributes like that.
[13:53:24] <halftroll> robertmaxrees: I do it a lot in my projects..
[13:53:41] <robertmaxrees> just letting you know it's not technically valid.
[13:53:57] <halftroll> really?, a lot of frontend frameworks use them
[13:54:05] <robertmaxrees> data attributes are a different story.
[13:54:33] <sillyslux> one day w3c mgihtdecide to add some foo attribute theirself
[13:54:34] <halftroll> :[, I didn't knew I wasn't supposed to use custom attributes :s
[13:54:44] <robertmaxrees> also: for selecting, use classes :)
[13:55:08] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[13:55:53] <halftroll> well, I will change them with prefix -data
[13:55:55] <halftroll> data-
[13:57:07] <halftroll> my question is still valid, if I need to iterate through all data-foo='hello' tags I would do $.each($([data-foo=hello]), function(index, elem) { .....
[13:57:14] <robertmaxrees> err.
[13:57:17] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[13:57:42] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/matkyk96/
[13:57:47] <robertmaxrees> $.each is meant for objects.
[13:58:05] <robertmaxrees> $(something).each() is for jquery objects.
[13:58:39] <halftroll> oh,my mistake
[13:58:49] <halftroll> so far I have done $(something).each(, you right
[13:59:16] <halftroll> the thing is that I want to iterate if the elements are children of certain other element that has certain id
[13:59:30] <halftroll> checking link
[13:59:41] <robertmaxrees> that's exactly what i did in the example ;)
[14:00:01] <halftroll> ok
[14:00:28] <halftroll> perfec
[14:00:34] <halftroll> perfect, thanks! !!!*
[14:01:12] <halftroll> my inside tags are of different types but I will play with it
[14:01:21] <robertmaxrees> same basic idea.
[15:14:05] <_geoff> i have <h4>foo<span>bar</span></h4>  i want to get just foo
[15:16:33] <MikeD_1> can you put another tag around the part you want to make addressable?
[15:17:34] <qakhan> hi all,
[15:18:05] <qakhan> i am using jquery validate plugin and using remote ajax.
[15:20:02] <qakhan> its works fine. but if i add the element attr "name" and try to call in remote ajax it does not get newly added element attr "name"
[15:23:38] <qakhan> here is my code https://pastebin.com/hujAnkQj
[15:24:14] <qakhan> i am not getting value in    company_exts : $('#tableheading').attr('name')
[15:30:44] <_geoff> MikeD_1: i cannot
[15:31:01] <_geoff> MikeD_1: i am doing an analytics implementation through a tag manager
[16:10:09] <robertmaxrees> _geoff there are a few ways to do that.
[16:16:19] <qakhan> any thought on my question
[16:17:43] <robertmaxrees> qakhan well, why are you adding that attribute like that?
[16:20:05] <qakhan> there is 1 combo box which has all companies name. when i select a company name it get the data of the company and show it in table
[16:20:22] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[16:20:30] <qakhan> now there is edit button next to every row
[16:20:45] <robertmaxrees> any reason you don't just have that input with the proper attribute name always and just populate the value?
[16:21:41] <qakhan> which brings up a form where i can update the user information
[16:22:00] <qakhan> that form need to be validate
[16:22:23] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to reinitialize or use https://jqueryvalidation.org/rules/
[16:23:01] <qakhan> as you can see in my code i am saving table name in $('#tableheading').attr('name')
[16:23:16] <robertmaxrees> there a reason you're ignoring what I'm saying?
[16:23:23] <robertmaxrees> just gave you two solutions O.o
[16:23:29] <qakhan> so that i can use that table name in jquery validate remote ajax call
[16:24:03] <qakhan> i am trying to explain what i am trying to do
[16:24:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:24:15] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) i got the gist.
[16:24:31] <qakhan> ok "any reason you don't just have that input with the proper attribute name always and just populate the value?"
[16:24:35] <qakhan> i did not get it
[16:25:01] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.  so it sounds like you neeed to reinitialize or use https://jqueryvalidation.org/rules/
[16:25:41] <qakhan> i did $(".editexten").validate({});
[16:25:52] <qakhan> after $('#tableheading').attr('name',selected_company_exts);
[16:25:53] <robertmaxrees> after you add the new elements?
[16:26:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah, then try .rules()
[16:29:55] <qakhan> should i remove all rules?
[16:30:01] <robertmaxrees> wut
[16:30:08] <robertmaxrees> you add rules to the element.
[16:31:02] <Mapper99> I have some code to dynamically update an input box - works fine everywhere except for on an iPad -even in Chrome - any idea why not?  https://pastebin.com/RXZ9f35X
[16:31:26] <robertmaxrees> var position = this.events.getMousePosition(e);
[16:31:47] <Mapper99> lol
[16:31:50] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:38:02] <qakhan> Thanks robertmaxrees you are great
[16:38:16] <robertmaxrees> i mean, fwiw - https://www.google.com/search?q=jquery+validate+add+element
[17:51:24] <xenaxon> hi all. How ca I remake this map area selector: https://www.mapdevelopers.com/area_finder.php
[17:51:42] <xenaxon> how can I make that selection in my oiwn script?
[17:51:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:52:30] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you can look at their code and see how they did it.
[17:59:21] <xenaxon> are you serious?
[17:59:43] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:00:09] <robertmaxrees> i mean, http://stackoverflow.com/a/8019559/923919
[18:02:01] <xenaxon> yes, and i found it being plotted on the map, (the polygon), but i dont see how to get it created upon click
[18:04:09] <robertmaxrees> google.maps.event.addListener(map, "click", function(a) { mapClick(a.latLng) });
[18:04:33] <robertmaxrees> can step through from there.
[18:06:36] <xenaxon> so then I just need to create polygon point at that coord
[18:06:43] <robertmaxrees> looks like it?
[18:06:57] <xenaxon> but 1  more detail
[18:07:19] <xenaxon> the polygon editor on their site, has points to edit the ploygon corners
[18:07:24] <xenaxon> and mid section
[18:07:31] <xenaxon> which i cant see on google site
[18:08:05] <robertmaxrees> code has all that, too.
[18:09:11] <xenaxon> ok
[18:09:18] <xenaxon> just found the code for rectangle
[18:09:23] <xenaxon> youre right
[18:09:28] <xenaxon> have to search a little bit
[18:09:32] <xenaxon> thanks!
[18:09:41] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[18:29:57] <Whiskey> robertmaxrees: do you never sleep :D
[18:30:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:30:10] <Whiskey> you seems to always be around
[18:30:11] <robertmaxrees> it's 3:30 in the afternoon here >.>
[18:30:18] <Whiskey> ooo, its 00:30 here :D

[19:31:41] <rand0m> hello
[19:33:31] <robertmaxrees> sup
[19:34:19] <rand0m> im tying to wrap my head around this problem
[19:34:21] <rand0m> https://jsfiddle.net/fLcjuzh6/1/
[19:34:39] <rand0m> i have 2 sets of data which I want to interleave and display as a list
[19:34:56] <robertmaxrees> meterdetails and meters?
[19:35:17] <rand0m> yeah
[19:35:42] <robertmaxrees> well for starters, one's an array of objects, the other is an object.
[19:35:50] <robertmaxrees> did you want to push meterDetails into meters?
[19:37:59] <rand0m> dont want to push anything, just want to loop through the array items of meters and then print object property 1 from meterDetails and then print object property 1 from loop object and repeat till end of loop
[19:40:31] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:40:36] <robertmaxrees> so my point still stands :)
[19:45:03] <robertmaxrees> rand0m https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fLcjuzh6/3/
[19:45:05] <robertmaxrees> something like this.
[19:45:10] <robertmaxrees> that errors now but you get the idea.
[19:45:31] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i go.
[19:45:32] <robertmaxrees> enjoy!

[19:51:09] <xenaxon> hey, guys. anybody can help me with google maps?
[19:51:23] <xenaxon> how can I extract the polygon coords from here: http://jsfiddle.net/jordanarseno/xw6gp9yq/19/
[19:51:36] <xenaxon> it has a log button but it doesn't do anything
[20:00:35] <rand0m> xenaxon:  it does log stuff
[20:02:07] <xenaxon> it logs stuff
[20:02:10] <xenaxon> but there's no coords
[20:02:20] <xenaxon> just the prototypes and javascript stuff
[20:09:46] <rand0m> xenaxon: I believe thats correct
[20:10:06] <rand0m> thats the only thing you'll get
