[11:17:35] <titou> hey
[11:18:24] <titou> I'm trying to show or hide an element which is on an popup created with window.open but it doesn't work
[11:18:57] <titou> what is strange is that when I try to debug it under google chrome, after $(popup.document).find('#element').hide();
[11:19:20] <titou> the element is hidden but when I press the "continue" ubtton of the debugger, the element is showed egain
[11:19:43] <titou> I don't really understand
[11:22:44] <titou> ok I found another solution thank you
[12:07:59] <spillere> https://jsfiddle.net/dansku/q9dxw8j9/3/ trying to add a new input when all the fields are filled, but the keyup function only works for the item that is not appended, help?
[12:09:30] <Neo1> Hi! I've done wholly class calculator with OOP, you can estimate
[12:09:30] <Neo1> code there https://hastebin.com/apikiwolir.js
[12:09:30] <Neo1> and example test functional there in bottom http://test.kselax.ru/test-2/
[12:09:37] <Neo1> is it good OOP?
[12:10:13] <Neo1> on that link we'll see this calculator in bottom
[12:12:12] <Neo1> look at code and estimate, I'll accept any corrections and suggestions :) . This style seems much better than functions.
[12:20:49] <spillere> how to get the value from an appended input field?
[12:21:14] <Neo1> spillere: $('input').val()  ??
[12:21:37] <Neo1> or $('input').attr('value');
[12:22:29] <spillere> Neo1: https://jsfiddle.net/dansku/q9dxw8j9/4/ trying to add new fields when they are filled up
[12:22:41] <shoky_> definitely not .attr('value')
[12:23:19] <spillere> but only the first field is creating new fields
[12:23:50] <Neo1> shoky_: it won't work?
[12:24:05] <shoky_> Neo1: not for getting the current value, no
[12:28:23] <spillere> does that make sense?
[12:29:31] <Neo1> spillere: don't know what you want to do
[12:29:42] <Neo1> where button to add new input?
[12:30:18] <spillere> Neo1: when all inputs are filled, it creates another input, but only the first one is checking if all of them are empty
[12:30:49] <spillere> does it make sense?
[12:33:10] <Neo1> spillere: yes
[12:33:24] <Neo1> check last element
[12:33:51] <Neo1> <div class="input"> input1 input2 </div>
[12:34:37] <Neo1> you need on your event put function that will choose last element in block , what is selector for last element?
[12:34:57] <Neo1> choose last input ant if it not empty you should to create new input
[12:35:56] <Neo1> spillere: you need to find the right selector CCS for determine last element
[12:36:53] <Neo1> spillere: see https://www.google.com.ua/search?q=jquery+determine+last+element&oq=jquery+determine+last+element&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.10936j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
[12:37:22] <Neo1> maybe last can help you, I've never use it yet
[12:46:42] <spillere> Neo1: thanks
