[02:45:31] <Cork> rockworld: no, 1.10 is safe
[02:45:47] <Cork> the big switch there was in 1.5
[02:45:58] <Cork> and you're already past that one
[06:52:29] <naftilos76> How do i search for any tag with an data- attribute that its' value is anything? var elements = $("[data-some_attr='value']");
[06:53:17] <Cork> you mean $([data-some_attr]') ?
[06:53:32] <Cork> oppps
[06:53:39] <Cork> *you mean $('[data-some_attr]')
[07:12:17] <bluereign> Is there a JQuery close element? I don't know jquery whatsoever, but trying to add a second button to close a menu.
[07:12:38] <Cork> uh close element?
[07:12:39] <bluereign> I wish to add a button that will close the element by id. close(menu-toggle).. something of that nature
[07:12:52] <patrickk> bluereign: then use another jquery function to "close" that
[07:13:11] <Cork> by close you mean hide?
[07:13:21] <patrickk> like if you did slideDown in the earlier, use slideUp for the close
[07:13:31] <patrickk> I guess that..
[07:14:21] <bluereign> I got it, perfect!
[07:14:35] * Cork sees an element that randomaly closes another element <div id="me"> <p>somethin</p> close(me)... @_@'
[08:18:26] <zenox> hi, i'm trying to select all h* elements in a div, but I don't appear to be able to target them with this: $('h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6','#preview'). <-- what am I doing wrong?
[08:20:08] <Tennis> do they all have the id preview?
[08:20:40] <Tennis> i've never used a selector like that but could you give them all the same class and select them that way
[08:20:50] <zenox> no, they're inside a div with preview
[08:21:11] <zenox> well, they were until i changed the id. i updated the #preview id to what it should be and it works :)
[08:21:26] <Tennis> cool
[08:21:48] <zenox> and unfortunately class would be sensible choice, but has to be id because of scrollspy
[09:07:19] <prillian5> Why this blur not work? https://jsfiddle.net/ke0jnnec/
[09:09:04] <prillian5> ah, seems I have to use focusout

[11:26:52] <hlve> Very quiet in here today.
[11:31:38] <MagnusVortex> "sneeze on your knuckles before a fight in order to inflict poison damage"
[11:32:15] <hlve> ew
[11:46:03] <ckb> Hey guys, I thought if I passed a string of HTML to jQuery, I could select an element out of the object. is this not the case? i.e. $(“#test”, $(“<div id=“test”></div>”))
[11:48:23] <hlve> o_O...
[11:48:33] <hlve> that's some interesting syntax.
[11:49:13] <ckb> just condensed :P
[11:55:25] <fuchstronaut> Why is jQuery screwing up my JavaScript object and submitting boolean values as strings (false -> "false") using $.post?
[11:56:46] <ckb> fuchstronaut: everything gets turned into a string since boolean values can’t be passed via query parameters
[11:57:18] <fuchstronaut> ckb: so there is no way around it and I will have to check the values server side?
[11:59:00] <taplar> ckb: $(selector, parent) is the syntax, but that selects children of the elemet
[12:03:16] <taplar> man i'm super sleepy today.  dunno what's going on
[12:04:37] <taplar> fuchstronaut: can you make a fiddle showing what you're doing?  fixing to go get some food, but i'll brb
[12:16:22] <ckb> fuchstronaut: correct. binary values cannot be passed through an HTTP request.
[12:17:23] <taplar> it all goes to a string but you should be able to control if it puts it in quotes or not
[12:26:48] <DelphiWorld> hey
[12:27:07] <DelphiWorld> i am using jquery mobile, can't handle the click of button
[12:27:22] <DelphiWorld> $("#play").click(function(){ alert ('...')); });
[12:28:01] <taplar> extra ')' on that alert
[12:28:21] <DelphiWorld> hold on taplar
[12:28:26] <DelphiWorld> let me past it from my file
[12:28:32] <DelphiWorld> this is the declaration of the button
[12:28:49] <DelphiWorld> <button id="share" class="ui-btn ui-icon-info ui-btn-icon-top">Share</button>
[12:29:10] <DelphiWorld> and the handler:
[12:29:21] <DelphiWorld> $("#play").click(function(){ alert ('hello!');});
[12:29:29] <DelphiWorld> sory but #share
[12:29:33] <DelphiWorld> i copy wrong line lol
[12:30:16] <taplar> have you console logged the selector before you do the binding?
[12:31:05] <DelphiWorld> how to console log it?
[12:31:29] <taplar> console.log($('#share').length); $('#share').on(...
[12:31:51] <DelphiWorld> i do it directly without any function?
[12:59:52] <taplar> yep
[13:31:29] <plamb> does jquery/javascript have a .contains method on string
[13:31:45] <taplar> indexOf
[13:32:05] <plamb> and if it returns what, greater than 0 its true?
[13:32:14] <taplar> > -1 is true
[13:32:21] <robertmaxrees> like arrays
[13:33:15] <plamb> so something like this to test if a string contains a word in the array:
[13:33:17] <plamb> https://jsfiddle.net/u9c5yzua/
[13:34:17] <taplar> Array also has an indexOf method
[13:34:19] <plamb> basically i want to find out if the string has one of the words in filters, then make that word bold
[13:34:36] <robertmaxrees> it's forEach for native arrays.
[13:34:39] <robertmaxrees> not each
[13:34:53] <taplar> you can google String.prototype and Array.prototype to find docs on the base elements
[13:36:44] <taplar> hmm, some how i flipped that array logic when i read it...
[13:36:48] * taplar goes back to his tea
[13:37:04] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u9c5yzua/1/
[13:37:06] <robertmaxrees> pretty basic idea.
[13:41:30] <plamb> hmm
[13:41:53] <plamb> robertmaxrees: i probably dont want to use filter if im just trying to make those matching words bold right?
[13:42:00] <plamb> or just append <strong> tags
[13:42:32] <robertmaxrees> you could forEach 'em if you wanted.  i just like my discrete operations.
[13:44:39] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u9c5yzua/2/
[13:44:41] <robertmaxrees> something like this.
[13:45:01] <robertmaxrees> swap those fat arrows out for normal functions if you need to support non-ES6.
[13:46:03] <plamb> is this syntax fairly new?
[13:46:11] <robertmaxrees> fat arrows are es2015
[13:46:55] <plamb> i aww
[13:46:59] <plamb> i see*
[13:47:05] <plamb> reminds me of scala which makes me happy
[13:47:19] <robertmaxrees> but not everything supports all features.
[13:47:26] <robertmaxrees> also changes how your context works.
[13:48:04] <plamb> is indexOf case sensitive
[13:48:11] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:48:16] <plamb> feelings
[13:48:25] <robertmaxrees> you can use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLowerCase
[13:48:35] <plamb> ah good call
[13:48:52] <robertmaxrees> for the match part at least.
[14:00:23] <plamb> robertmaxrees: whats going wrong here? I'm trying to do the same thing, but for multiple <p>'s. Getting a syntax error on the .each line:
[14:00:24] <plamb> https://jsfiddle.net/u9c5yzua/6/
[14:02:30] <plamb> whoa
[14:02:38] <plamb> is it because tehre was a comma after that array?
[14:02:51] <plamb> i think so, lol
[14:11:50] <DelphiWorld> anything wrong in this templating?
[14:11:54] <DelphiWorld> <button class="ui-btn" onclick="window.plugins.socialsharing.share("{{{title}}}", null, null, "{{{url}}}", null)">Share</button>
[14:13:35] <DelphiWorld> this one works:
[14:13:36] <DelphiWorld> <button onclick="window.plugins.socialsharing.share('Message, image and link', null, 'https://www.google.nl/images/srpr/logo4w.png', 'http://www.x-services.nl')">message, image and link</button>
[14:14:33] <taplar> it's a jquery room bro
[14:14:47] <DelphiWorld> taplar: yes i am using jquery mobile bro
[14:14:49] <DelphiWorld> ;)
[14:15:30] <taplar> what mobile method are you using for templates?
[14:15:58] <DelphiWorld> handlebar
[14:16:19] <taplar> handlebar js?
[14:16:42] <taplar> cause that's not jquery
[14:16:57] <DelphiWorld> yes but in combination with jqm
[14:17:16] <taplar> if the template constructs valid logic for jquery, it'll work
[14:17:36] <taplar> if you are expecting us to know how to make handlebarjs do that, that's back to my jquery room comment
[14:17:46] <DelphiWorld> no
[14:18:01] <DelphiWorld> but i thought i am giving the templating wrong to my code
[14:18:04] <DelphiWorld> that's all
[14:18:34] <DelphiWorld> if i do this in my code:
[14:18:38] <DelphiWorld> <button onclick="window.plugins.socialsharing.share('Message, image and link', null, 'https://www.google.nl/images/srpr/logo4w.png', 'http://www.x-services.nl')">message, image and link</button>
[14:18:47] <DelphiWorld> this works and bring me the sharing dialog
[14:18:49] <DelphiWorld> but i fi do this
[14:19:41] <DelphiWorld> <button onclick="window.plugins.socialsharing.share('{{{title}}}, null, null, '{{{url}}})">Share</button>
[14:19:46] <DelphiWorld> give me nothing at all
[14:19:58] <DelphiWorld> so what i am asking is am i giving the templating info correctly?
[14:20:06] <taplar> no clue
[14:20:29] <taplar> though are you sure the single quotes around those {{{}}} is right?
[14:20:55] <DelphiWorld> i saw the plugin example using ' not "
[14:21:21] <taplar> i mean from what you pasted you have '{{{title}}}, null
[14:21:28] <taplar> should there not be a ' after the }}} ?
[14:21:59] <DelphiWorld> yes should be there a ' after the }
[14:22:00] <DelphiWorld> like this
[14:22:02] <DelphiWorld> <button onclick="window.plugins.socialsharing.share('{{{title}}}', null, null, '{{{url}}})">Share</button>
[14:22:12] <taplar> same with url?
[14:22:14] <DelphiWorld> that was my fault cause i manualy wrote it without copying from my code...
[14:22:43] <DelphiWorld> am i stupid or what... oh... odd
[14:23:21] <DelphiWorld> this is the final line
[14:23:22] <DelphiWorld> <button onclick="window.plugins.socialsharing.share('{{{title}}}', null, null, '{{{url}}}')">Share</button>
[14:23:55] <taplar> ok, so if you inspect the element that handlebars is generating, does it look right?
[14:24:09] <DelphiWorld> taplar: go to sleep bro... i am stupid honestly
[14:24:21] <DelphiWorld> the ' after url was making the issue
[14:24:26] * taplar would love to sleep
[14:24:38] * DelphiWorld would love to give taplar some gift
[14:44:11] <DelphiWorld> guys, what's the best way to save my feed to localstorage, then read from it? https://dpaste.de/NCXy
[14:44:44] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean by "best"?
[14:45:01] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: what to use
[14:45:08] <robertmaxrees> you... use localstorage?
[14:45:09] <robertmaxrees> don'
[14:45:17] <robertmaxrees> *don't really need anything else
[14:45:56] <DelphiWorld> but i'm lost on what to save in localstorage...
[14:46:02] <DelphiWorld> the object itself, or the fields or ...
[14:46:07] <robertmaxrees> the object.
[14:46:17] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage
[14:47:16] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API this has some suggestions.
[14:47:26] <robertmaxrees> i'd create a blogData object.
[14:47:33] <robertmaxrees> tho i gotta ask: why do you want to use it?
[14:47:50] <DelphiWorld> to provide offline reading
[14:48:31] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[14:48:50] <DelphiWorld> 'key?
[14:48:51] <DelphiWorld> lol
[14:48:52] <DelphiWorld> or okay
[14:48:53] <DelphiWorld> :P
[14:48:55] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[14:49:00] <DelphiWorld> haha
[14:49:26] <robertmaxrees> either way, pretty trivial to do.
[14:49:35] <DelphiWorld> yes, trying to do it
[14:50:04] <DelphiWorld> app.blogData = $(data).find("item").map(function(i, item) {
[14:50:08] <DelphiWorld> i think it should be done here
[14:50:18] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:50:34] <DelphiWorld> it should be retrieved inside of that function
[14:50:38] <robertmaxrees> why?
[14:50:52] <DelphiWorld> no no, in the get_blog_data: function() {
[14:51:08] <robertmaxrees> you could just save the data in that callback before trying to work with it.
[14:51:34] <DelphiWorld> in the get blog data function?
[14:51:42] <robertmaxrees> $.get("http://my.wordpress.com/?feed=rss2", function(data) {
[14:51:47] <robertmaxrees> first line after that.
[14:52:10] <DelphiWorld> yep but i am looking what's the object to be saved
[14:52:17] <robertmaxrees> just dave all of it.
[14:52:25] <DelphiWorld> the app.blogdata
[14:52:26] <robertmaxrees> *save
[14:52:36] <robertmaxrees> or fix your servber
[14:52:48] <DelphiWorld> what's wrong with my server
[14:52:57] <robertmaxrees> you're returning data in the wrong format.
[14:53:04] <DelphiWorld> its in xml
[14:53:17] <robertmaxrees> you're running a transform first thing.
[14:53:23] <robertmaxrees> why not return it in the format you actually need?
[14:53:32] <DelphiWorld> it's allready in xml
[14:53:44] <robertmaxrees> why not fix it?
[14:53:55] <DelphiWorld> fix it to be what?
[14:54:04] <robertmaxrees> the actual format you need.
[14:54:16] <DelphiWorld> i still want it to be xml, man
[14:54:25] <robertmaxrees> uh, why?
[14:54:27] <DelphiWorld> what i am looking for is to save it in localstorage
[14:54:40] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees, because rss is in xml
[14:54:44] <robertmaxrees> your first operation is to transoform it into another format.  why not just hand it the actual format instead?
[14:54:52] <robertmaxrees> seems kind of strange, is all.
[14:54:59] <DelphiWorld> lol
[14:55:03] <robertmaxrees> i'd make an endpoint that returns the data you actually want.
[14:56:24] <robertmaxrees> either way, pretty trivial to shunt whatever you need into localStorage.
[15:02:09] <Cyclohexane> $('.followup-form').trigger("reset"); seems to be causing a radio button to change, that radio button has an on change event $(document).on('change', 'input[name="date_type"]', function() { .. }); how come it's not running when the reset occurs?
[15:02:35] <taplar> logical changes usually do not trigger events
[15:02:55] <taplar> events typically originate directly from user interaction
[15:04:11] <DelphiWorld> taplar: if you saw my code, would i be able to get the "enclosure url" tag like the title and date and others?
[15:04:53] <taplar> i missed your code
[15:05:14] <DelphiWorld> want me to repast? :P
[15:05:40] <taplar> are you talking about the things you are passing into that method in the onclick?
[15:06:11] <DelphiWorld> no, talking about the $.http
[15:06:21] <DelphiWorld> where i am maping the rss fields to my blog data object
[15:06:46] <DelphiWorld> enclosure url
[15:06:49] <DelphiWorld> see here,
[15:06:51] <DelphiWorld> url: $(item).find("link").text(),
[15:07:01] <taplar> i'm not familiar with the jQuery.http method
[15:07:18] <DelphiWorld> this will give me the link url into a var called "url"
[15:07:32] <DelphiWorld> but the enclosure url i am not sure if i could parce i
[15:08:21] <DelphiWorld> mediaurl: $(item).find("enclosure url").text(),
[15:08:24] <DelphiWorld> this is my way
[15:08:52] <taplar> k
[15:09:02] <DelphiWorld> but i will see if it'll get parced
[15:12:20] <DelphiWorld> not parcing...
[15:12:47] <taplar> what is 'item'?
[15:12:59] <DelphiWorld> the item is part of the rss object
[15:13:05] <DelphiWorld> rss object contain several items
[15:13:40] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/226663/parse-rss-with-jquery#6271906
[15:15:58] <DelphiWorld> taplar: goog e api is died...  i am parcing xml directly
[15:35:38] <DelphiWorld> mediaurl: $(item).find("enclosure url").text(),code: https://dpaste.de/NCXy
[15:58:54] <plamb> does .find() search every child, grandchildren included
[16:02:02] <pavonia> Yes
[16:25:13] <plamb> oh no robert is gone
[16:25:31] <plamb> any idea why "cassandra" isnt bolded twice here:
[16:25:32] <plamb> https://jsfiddle.net/u9c5yzua/10/
[16:27:06] <plamb> its that filter operation
[16:27:10] <plamb> not sure how to change it
[16:27:40] <plamb> how would i change it to pick up a matching word multiple times?>
[16:29:20] <taplar> give https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace a read
[16:34:46] <plamb> will something like
[16:34:56] <plamb> .replace(">","\n") give you new lines
[16:40:44] <taplar> try and see
[16:42:43] <plamb> why is regex so painful
[16:42:58] <taplar> ?

[21:48:10] <MagnusVortex> Okay, so when I run $.getJSON("url",data,function (response){...   that data part, what is that called?
[21:48:59] <MagnusVortex> I'm trying to ask for help in the language I'm writing this server in, but I'm not even sure what words to use when I ask
[21:52:40] <shoky_> request data, query
[21:58:20] <MagnusVortex> so if I run  $.getJSON("url", "Here:" + data.ID, function (response){...  then the data shows up after the url. If, however, I remove the "Here:" string, the data seems to be dropped
[22:06:10] <MagnusVortex> shoky_: is that expected?
