[00:13:17] <hiby007> Cork  added onClick listener problem solved, thank you.
[00:13:52] <Cork> hiby007: also it isn't forbidden to ask js questions here :)
[00:13:58] <Cork> it is just slightly off topic
[00:14:17] <Cork> (just like jquery questions is slightly off topic for ##javascript)
[00:14:33] <hiby007> ok, next time won't happen, my bad
[00:14:43] <Cork> lol don't take it that hard
[00:14:47] <Cork> i didn't mean it like that
[00:15:03] <Cork> was just a slight hint ^^'
[00:15:04] <hiby007> ok :D
[00:15:30] <hives> freedom of speach!
[00:16:29] <Cork> it's just that it's very nice if questions is as on topic for a channel as possible, it makes it easier to have the correct frame of mind for the question
[00:16:40] <Cork> (i'm in both #jquery and ##javascript so...)
[00:23:06] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:42:52] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/tZJQp/22/ <-- Why don´t it load the content from the ajax request i try to do?
[00:44:33] <Cork> Whiskey: are you running the ajax request from 31.44.232.185 ?
[00:45:15] <Whiskey> no what i try to do is to load content from that site into my div
[00:45:25] <Cork> you can't do that
[00:45:29] <Cork> the browser will block you
[00:45:48] <Whiskey> is it anyway to do that?
[00:45:58] <Cork> you can proxy it over your own server
[00:46:18] <Whiskey> well thats not needed as it will be local in the end if thats what you say it need to come from same domain right?
[00:46:20] <Cork> or if you control the remote server you can config it to send cors headers that allows your domain from accessing it
[00:46:29] <Cork> Whiskey: yes
[00:46:50] <Cork> Whiskey: basically you should never need to use the protocol or domain in the url
[00:46:59] <Cork> if you do your in trouble :)
[00:47:22] <Whiskey> ok i try to find something to test whit
[00:47:38] <Cork> Whiskey: check in the browsers console
[00:47:45] <Cork> it will have a warning about the block there
[00:47:59] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/tZJQp/23/ <-- like that did not work ether
[00:48:05] <Whiskey> synax error was what i was told
[00:48:16] <Cork> still not the same domain
[00:48:39] <Cork> http://fiddle.jshell.net/ != http://doc.jsfiddle.net/
[00:48:45] <Whiskey> oooooo
[00:49:01] <Cork> and it checkes the entire domain
[00:49:03] <Cork> not just parts of it
[00:49:21] <Cork> (or rather it checks the fqdn + port)
[00:49:41] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/tZJQp/24/ <-- works fine :)
[00:50:17] <Cork> Whiskey: just remove the domain from the url
[00:50:53] <Whiskey> yeh
[00:50:59] <Whiskey> thx cork
[00:55:36] <Whiskey> that was not easy to debug Cork :)
[00:55:52] <Cork> if you used the browser console it would be
[00:55:53] <Whiskey> was not text() removing all elements and just parse the text if it is any?
[00:56:10] <Cork> ya
[00:56:53] <Whiskey> does that means like i told it parse whats inside the elements? but not the rest like "<script>all in here will be parsed</script>"
[00:57:40] <Cork> no cause script tags doesn't contribute its content to the text flow
[00:58:51] <Whiskey> strange anyways lets try it
[01:03:06] <Whiskey> Cork: i got it working :/ just one problem it remove the spaces and line breaks, anyway to avoid it when site is parsed?
[01:03:36] <Cork> it will remove the spaces according to how html is parsed
[01:03:43] <Cork> and no you can't get around that
[01:04:47] <Whiskey> ok
[01:06:56] <Whiskey> sad for me then :)
[01:46:51] <lemony> Im trying to use the jquery Tags manager plug in but I keep getting the following error : Object [object Object] has no method 'tagsManager'
[01:46:57] <lemony> any advice?
[01:47:05] <lemony> and yes the JS file has been loaded properly in the head
[01:47:23] <Cork> make sure the lib is actually loaded
[02:04:12] <aro_> can you select an element based on hash?
[02:04:21] <aro_> i know it will require some parsing, but still
[02:04:57] <aro_> $('a[href=^hash= or something?
[02:06:50] <Cork> aro_: [href$="#<value>"]
[02:07:09] <Cork> aro_: warning though, it might be slow
[02:07:22] <aro_> i know... thats what i wanted to avoid if possible
[02:08:53] <Cork> aro_: only fast option would be to set a class on those links
[02:08:58] <aro_> ok
[02:09:48] <Cork> aro_: but how slow the other selector is might depend on the browser; and how many links you have to loop through
[02:15:05] <lemony> Cork: it is loaded
[02:16:24] <Cork> lemony: do you have a link?
[02:16:51] <lemony> no
[02:16:57] <lemony> cant provide one
[02:17:21] <lemony> just a sec, might just be the horrible legacy code ive been given
[02:17:30] <Cork> then there isn't much anyone other then you can do
[02:17:46] <Cork> for some reason the lib isn't loading or adding it self to the jquery object
[02:18:07] <Cork> one reason could be that you for example load two versions of jquery
[02:18:15] <lemony> which is what I think is happening
[02:18:50] <Cork> well then if you use the jquery version where the lib was loaded you would be fine
[02:18:52] <lemony> the boostrap template provides its own jquery and boostrap js
[02:19:06] <lemony> which I suspect is not playing nicely
[02:19:09] <Cork> but ya, two version of jquery is bad
[02:19:36] <lemony> bleh
[02:19:38] <lemony> that aint it
[02:20:20] <lemony> this is something else
[02:28:23] <lemony> Cork: legacy code had some file that was interfering
[03:15:51] <fabioportieri> friggin chrome does not render text inside td cells properly :<
[03:16:07] <Cork> uh, it doesn't?
[03:16:30] <Cork> haven't seen any problems here
[03:16:32] <fabioportieri> Cork: dunno, it behaves differently from ff at least, it break words but idon't want that
[03:16:54] <Cork> fabioportieri: so set white-space: nowrap; on the td
[03:17:02] <fabioportieri> http://ryan.stawarz.com/tech-tidbits/chrome-table-cells-not-word-wrapping-correctly/ tried this
[03:17:37] <fabioportieri> Cork: oh
[03:17:43] <fabioportieri> Cork: that works
[03:17:54] <Cork> it won't wrap anything with that setting though
[03:18:04] <fabioportieri> funny how i didn't considered that because in my text i didn't have white spaces
[03:18:25] <Cork> fabioportieri: url?
[03:18:33] <fabioportieri> don't have a live page atm
[03:18:40] <Cork> i meant is the content urls?
[03:18:46] <fabioportieri> ah no, just a date
[03:18:51] <Cork> ah
[03:18:52] <fabioportieri> dd-mm-yyyy
[03:19:01] <Cork> well som characters has breakable meaning
[03:19:08] <Cork> - is one of them
[03:19:23] <fabioportieri> ah i see, like white spaces?
[03:19:29] <Cork> yes
[03:19:32] <Cork> . is another
[03:19:37] <Cork> and in firefox /
[03:19:43] <Cork> (not sure about chrome there)
[03:20:05] <fabioportieri> thanks for the fix Cork
[03:20:11] <Cork> np
[03:44:36] <mikec2> Is there a specification written anywhere for how jQuery serializes an object into a query string? Ie, how it converts a {foo:[1,2]} to "foo[]=1&foo[]=2" ... I can make a reasonable guess how it works from looking at it, but I would like to read a specification as I'm trying to implement it in another language...
[03:44:51] <mikec2> My Google foo is not helping
[03:54:45] <Cork> mike_f: $.param()
[03:55:18] <Cork> just look into that function
[03:57:03] <Whiskey> How can i reload an image on a page, i have a code but it not works
[03:57:04] <Cork> opps
[03:57:11] <Cork> mikec2: ^
[03:57:15] <Cork> mikec2: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/serialize.js#L46
[03:57:26] <Whiskey> $("img.toggleable").removeAttr("src").attr("src","index.php?db=1&amp;uid=8b2035b3b5c944a4e6fb8660a8f8669f&amp;image=1");
[03:57:44] <Cork> Whiskey: no entity
[03:57:49] <Whiskey> hmmm javascript don´t use this scapes
[03:57:52] <Whiskey> enitiy?
[03:57:52] <Cork> it isn't html
[03:57:56] <Whiskey> i know :)
[03:57:58] <Cork> html entity
[03:58:11] <Cork> &amp; in this case
[03:58:14] <Whiskey> yeh
[04:00:23] <Whiskey> it don´t need full url ether right
[04:00:50] <Cork> urls work the same in js as in any other resource
[04:10:27] <shwaiil> Q: I've got a slider with a callback fn that pauses the slider when mouse over the current slide. The content is an iframe (vimeo video player). Mouseover doesn't trigger this. I wonder what I can do ? Thanks!
[04:23:13] <Cork> shwaiil: there is only one option sadly
[04:23:28] <Cork> shwaiil: you can put an element ontop of the widget
[04:23:29] <shwaiil> $('.mySlide iframe').on('mouseover', fn()); ?
[04:23:39] <Cork> shwaiil: but that means you can't click in the iframe
[04:23:44] <Cork> shwaiil: no
[04:23:49] <Cork> remember it is an iframe
[04:23:56] <Cork> and it is from a third party domain
[04:23:57] <shwaiil> Cork: I see
[04:24:00] <Cork> you can't access events from it
[04:24:32] <Cork> if it was from your own domain you could attach an event listener to the document of the iframe
[04:24:41] <Cork> but as it is a third party you have no such option
[04:25:38] <Cork> (been there done that; yes it sucks, but it is a necessity sadly)
[04:26:56] <shwaiil> Cork: ok thanks  : )
[04:42:56] <darkangel> I'm trying to reset a file input using something similar to this: http://stackoverflow.com/a/17183001/221528 ... but the unwrap removes the element from the DOM for some reason, any idea why? (Firefox 26.0)
[04:51:09] <darkangel> Now I can't repro in JSFiddle, pffft.
[04:51:54] <Tomashe> how do i check if somehting null < since iconsole.log  and the output was null
[04:52:05] <Tomashe> but if (x == null ) isnt really working
[04:52:30] <Cork> Tomashe: what is it your checking?
[04:52:56] <Cork> Tomashe: it might actually be "null"
[04:53:03] <Tomashe> hmm
[04:53:23] <Cork> though that sounds like something is failing
[04:53:28] <Tomashe> nop its not
[04:53:36] <Tomashe> when console.log iget NULL
[04:53:43] <Cork> NULL?
[04:53:46] <Tomashe> null <
[04:53:48] <Cork> NULL isn't js
[04:53:48] <Tomashe> sorry
[04:53:53] <Cork> ah
[04:54:07] <Tomashe> so if x == "null" < with quetes?
[04:54:30] <Cork> js> var a = null; print(a == null ? 'true' : 'false')
[04:54:33] <b-ot> Cork: true
[04:56:05] <Tomashe> actually i did that test
[04:56:26] <Tomashe> when i do if (x==null ) { } else { it goes to the else }
[04:58:43] <Tomashe> ok thanks guys
[05:03:40] <michaud> Anyone know what causing the hide() to be called on all the targeted list items in this jQuery mobile exercise? http://jsfiddle.net/michaud/YLd3C/
[05:08:47] <decx> michaud because it's not ourClass == 'all'
[05:09:08] <decx> you put all the classes of the element in ourClass so in the case of the all topics link it's 'all ui-link'
[05:12:22] <michaud> decx, thanks! That's what I was overlooking for jQuery Mobile. Appreciate the help
[05:14:30] <decx> you can put it in a data-selection(or whatever data-* you want) attribute instead that would be cleaner anyway
[05:16:53] <virgomoon> I've been struggling with something this morning I hope someone can help with .. I have a jqueryui Menu defined with <ul><li>..</li></ul> that works fine except that some menu items are links ( <a..>..</a> ) and some are just text handled by a click event.  Is there a good way to get the 'just text' ones looking the same as the links?  If I make the text ones <a href='#'>..</a> links the click event never happens.  Seems it's "taken" by the link clicking.
[05:18:29] <decx> remove the href attribute completely?
[05:18:59] <michaud> decx, I'll try that one too, but it also worked when I was searching for the first class value with: var ourClass = $(this).attr('class').split(" ")[0];
[05:19:21] <virgomoon> hmm .. didn't try that, lol
[05:19:29] <fabioportieri> i don't think it makes valid html a link without href
[05:19:52] <lundy> anyone know why this might not be working? 	$('td .time').bind('click', function(){ $('span').(this).attr('id').hide();
[05:20:04] <decx> it's valid fabioportieri
[05:20:09] <virgomoon> decx, you're a genius
[05:20:09] <virgomoon> lol
[05:20:15] <virgomoon> perfect
[05:20:50] <decx> well i'll take your word for it virgomoon ;)
[05:21:57] <fabioportieri> decx: ah, good to know
[05:22:00] <decx> fabioportieri http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element
[05:24:49] <decx> lundy you can't chain a selector with this
[05:25:15] <lundy> kk
[05:25:29] <decx> lundy what do you want to taget relative to the position of .time?
[05:25:43] <decx> *target
[05:26:01] <lundy> what im trying to do is have a Table and if you click on each TD it hides the text and shows a form
[05:26:09] <lundy> basically making it a Editable TD
[05:27:20] <Cork> lundy: what are you trying to express with $('span').(this) ?
[05:27:23] <decx> so it's <td><span class="time">x</span> <form style="display: none">...</form></td>
[05:27:24] <lundy> yes
[05:27:37] <decx> $(this).hide().next('form').show()
[05:29:06] <t0th_-> hi
[05:29:23] <t0th_-> i have a form with submit, how i can remove an input inside the submit event?
[05:29:43] <Keika> hey guys.
[05:29:55] <lundy> decx sorry to be a pain but if I save the form how would I hide the form and show the text again ?
[05:31:06] <decx> in your submit event you can do $(this.form).hide().prev('span').show() .. but it's hard to tell without seeing the example
[05:31:08] <Tomashe> whats the right way to look if html is empty $("selector").html() == or html== ?
[05:31:12] <Keika> I'm trying to select an input and populate its value using $(element).val('222'); It finds the element correctly but then doesn't apply the value. Why is that?
[05:32:49] <decx> Tomashe .is(':empty')
[05:33:11] <Tomashe> thanks
[05:33:37] <decx> you can also use it as a pseudo selector
[05:33:45] <decx> $('div:empty')
[05:33:56] <t0th_-> any?
[05:34:10] <t0th_-> i have a form with submit, how i can remove an input inside the submit event?
[05:34:38] <decx> $('[name=mynameinput]').remove() ?
[05:34:54] <decx> any way you can target it
[05:35:07] <decx> what's your problem with that t0th_- ?
[05:35:21] <Keika> I'm trying to select an input and populate its value using $(element).val('222'); It finds the element correctly but then doesn't apply the value. Why is that?
[05:35:57] <decx> Keika put you problem in a jsfiddle demo, it sounds like a user problem ;)
[05:36:14] <t0th_-> i have a form, i put a click in submit, how i can remove an input from submit?
[05:36:16] <Keika> user problem??
[05:36:32] <decx> yeah like a typo or some wrong tag
[05:38:26] <Keika> but it does find the input I need. When I console log $(element)
[05:38:27] <decx> t0th_- http://jsfiddle.net/decx/27pEq/
[05:39:16] <Keika> theres only one input and it's a simple action, I think...
[05:44:49] <t0th_-> thanks
[05:49:27] <IamTrying> How to get ride of it? http://localhost/  giving me: getUserMedia error:  NavigatorUserMediaError {constraintName: "", message: "", name: "PermissionDeniedError"}
[06:03:11] <IamTrying> OK -  solved, have to use SSL (https not http)
[06:13:44] <Edek> Hi
[06:23:59] <Keika> anyone here?
[06:24:53] <Keika> say I have an input within a div as a template. How can I change the value of the input without removing the div before compiling?
[06:38:09] <Cork> Keika: is the template html or dom?
[06:38:23] <Keika> string
[06:38:33] <Keika> html string
[06:45:06] <Keika> any idea Cork?
[06:45:35] <Ansikt> Hey - I'm thinking of replacing the default select boxes on my site with custom ones.  I know there's a ton of jquery plugins which do this, including jQuery mobile and jQuery UI. My requirements will include a lot of custom styling, including nested markup, complex data structures. etc.  Are there any plugins the users of #jquery would suggest?
[06:45:36] <Cork> Keika: search and replace string handling then
[06:45:46] <Cork> you can't do jquery magic on strings
[06:46:04] <Keika> Im searching with find
[06:46:04] <maxorator> I'm doing "$.ajax("/query", {type: "POST", dataType: "text"});", yet it still tries to parse the result as XML, so I'm getting "no element found" error (Firefox)
[06:59:29] <Ansikt> Basically - what plugin would be best for writing the "Qty" dropdown on this site: http://www.zazzle.com/hey_foxy_by_origami_prints_valentine_folded_card-137551420819436042
[06:59:44] <Ansikt> Ours won't be exactly like that, but it will be similar in terms of complexity
[07:13:28] <decx> Ansikt write your own, that style of dropdown isn't really that complex that you'd need a third party plugin
[07:18:10] <Vivekananda> A question. The newer websites have very nice effects eg the load button in above site and similar. I wanted to have a visually appealing pop up as a div to show up on an ajax request and change dynamically based on values changed in the div. I want this to be very responsive too. How do I do this ? Also what designs can I look at and where ?
[07:18:38] <jedimind> thats quite the quetsion
[07:19:25] <Vivekananda> Well I am just looking for feelers and places to get ideas
[07:19:33] <Vivekananda> with that aim in mind
[07:21:50] <Dbugger> Hi guys. I come across a weird thing. $("<div></div>")  or $("<b></b>") seem to work fine, but $("<html></html>") returns nothing. How is that possible??
[07:23:05] <jedimind> what are you trying to do Dbugger ?
[07:23:10] <jedimind> that's not a selector
[07:23:25] <decx> i read this about 5 times and i'm still not getting it Vivekananda
[07:23:55] <Dbugger> jedimind: Well, with div , it creates a new div element wrapped in jQuery
[07:24:06] <Dbugger> So i want to create a HTML element with jQUery wrapped
[07:24:15] <jedimind> you cant have multiple HTML elements
[07:24:18] <jedimind> in a single html document
[07:24:26] <jedimind> and a html document is not valid until it has <html> tags init
[07:24:36] <jedimind> so it makes sense that javascript wont let you create a new one, because you already have one
[07:24:58] <decx> How Can Html Elements Be Real If Our Dom Isn't Real?
[07:25:16] <Dbugger> jedimind: this all comes because I am making an AJAX call to my website, and the result is the html in a string. So when I make $(data) in the callback, I get a weird long array
[07:25:32] <Vivekananda> decx: lol okay so I will try to make it simpler. I want  1. Learn about cool animation effects for pop up boxes/divs and also for refreshing divs and popups   2. I want to make a box responsive to ajax requests. I want to know more dos and dont's for 2
[07:26:08] <Dbugger> jedimind: Say im trying to get the title of the ajax call, so I would expect to do $("title", data), but that doesnt work
[07:27:28] <decx> Vivekananda well i dont know about best practises but i try to keep my 'responsive' stuff in my css media queries and do it separately from js, apart from the occasional screen-width check
[07:28:01] <jedimind> Dbugger ok well dont create the <html> element
[07:28:06] <jedimind> just inject everything inside the existing one?
[07:28:19] <Dbugger> Yeah, I know, I was trying to find out the problem
[07:28:40] <Dbugger> jedimind: but I dont want to get the whole HTML from my ajax call, just some parts
[07:28:52] <jedimind> the problem is that the html tag should already exist by the time js is triggered, and you cant have more than one, so the ability to create a random <html> tag doesn exist because it shouldnt
[07:29:10] <jedimind> then just grab the parts you need? dump the data somewhere, or when you do the ajax call specify a section of the page you want
[07:29:17] <jedimind> i think .load() lets you specify elements
[07:29:21] <jedimind> .load('index.html #content')
[07:29:26] <jedimind> iirc, its been a while
[07:29:39] <decx> you can do .load('mypage.html #myfragment'), or you can $(data).find('#myfragment') in your ajax success before you include it somewhere
[07:30:04] <decx> you remembered right jedimind
[07:30:06] <Dbugger> jedimind: I agree, load works, but I want to grab more than 1 element, and I dont want to make twice the same request
[07:30:30] <jedimind> Dbugger what decx said
[07:30:43] <jedimind> $(data).find('#something') $(data).find('#somethingelse');
[07:32:23] <Dbugger> yeah, it what I have been saying. Im trying to do $(data).find('#myfragment') in the callback, but $(data) doesnt parse well the document
[07:33:54] <BillCriswell> Dbugger: You might need to use .filter('#myfragment') if it's in the first level.
[07:34:05] <decx> hehe that one again
[07:34:39] <decx> i actually used that in a project the other day and thought to myself: BillCriswell just saved me a ton of headaches
[07:35:06] <Dbugger> BillCriswell: let me take a look
[07:35:14] <BillCriswell> decx: It drove me crazy a couple of times!
[07:35:37] <BillCriswell> Dbugger: $('<li><a href="#">Foo</a></li>').find('li') wouldn't work, but .filter('li') would. You can get the <a> with .find('a') though.
[07:36:02] <Dbugger> BillCriswell: That DID work!
[07:36:12] <Dbugger> Amazing, thanks. you are a hero
[07:36:31] <decx> agreed
[07:36:55] <decx> but it's still strange, is it a bug or expected behaviour?
[07:37:03] <Dbugger> It is really weird, when I made console.log($(data)) the output was so bizarre, I thought my html was wrong
[07:37:32] <Dbugger> decx: I dont know, It would be interesting to try it out with another version of jquery
[07:37:47] <fabioportieri> i guess find() won't work because the elements aren't in the dom yet?
[07:38:04] <decx> the problem is that find doesnt work on root elements
[07:38:19] <BillCriswell> decx: If you were to do $('<li><a href="#">Foo</a></li>').addClass('foo') I believe it would add the class ot the <li>. It does make sense once I thought about it fora while.
[07:38:22] <decx> i guess it makes sense
[07:38:35] <Dbugger> decx: you think it makes sense?
[07:38:42] <Dbugger> I would have expected it to work =P
[07:38:51] <decx> i'm telling myself it does make sense but i dont believe me
[07:38:53] <decx> ;)
[07:38:54] <BillCriswell> I think it seems counter intuitive at first glance.
[07:39:39] <BillCriswell> If you do $('li') to grab some <li>s you wouldn't use .find() to find those <li>'s again.
[07:40:06] <decx> yeah in that sense it does actually make sense
[07:40:16] <decx> double sense even
[07:40:27] <Dbugger> Anyway, got it
[07:40:30] <Dbugger> thanks =)
[07:40:35] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[07:40:44] <decx> but if i have the li already i wouldnt need filter either
[07:40:51] <decx> so in a way it doesnt make sense ;)
[07:41:56] <BillCriswell> decx: If you only want certain <li>s it's useful. $('li').filter('.new').append('<span>New Item!</span>')
[07:44:36] <BillCriswell> It's all magic.
[07:44:54] <decx> so $(data) would contain all the root elements on one layer
[07:45:12] <airdem> i once had the same problem
[07:45:21] <decx> and that'S why you cant do find('h1') or similar
[07:45:31] <airdem> use filter if the element you want is on the root level
[07:45:46] <fabioportieri> filter operates on a collection while find will look at the dom, isn't that the issue?
[07:45:52] <airdem> and .find if the element is inside another
[07:45:52] <BillCriswell> decx: I think we wrap everything automatically in a document with our brain haha.
[07:45:57] <decx> yeah, we're just trying to understand why airdem ;)
[07:46:10] <decx> probably true BillCriswell
[07:46:33] <airdem> imo find should also search on the root level
[07:46:50] <airdem> but maybe there is greater meaning behind the present function
[07:48:37] <BillCriswell> I hate windows.
[07:48:55] <decx> better than a hole in the wall
[07:49:06] <airdem> i saw it comin
[07:49:24] <airdem> Microsoft "Works"
[07:56:30] <jedimind> vladikoff
[07:56:35] <jedimind> can we get a quick temp ban ?
[07:56:39] <jedimind> or ajpiano
[08:01:55] <malusalexandru> Hy guys. I'm doing an ajax function which should process as JS, yet the answer is as */*. gist: https://gist.github.com/maimutza/23fc6910577c65aaa187
[08:03:28] <decx> malusalexandru use .getScript instead
[08:03:45] <decx> oh it's a post
[08:03:51] <malusalexandru> decx: yes
[08:04:08] <decx> isnt it dataType script anywaY?
[08:04:12] <malusalexandru> decx: if I write dataType of Json it works
[08:04:16] <malusalexandru> decx: i need it as JS
[08:05:49] <malusalexandru> decx: thank you for the suggestion, indeed is "script", i'm doing ajax in rails and I didn't know this
[08:06:10] <decx> and i totally didn't just guess, but you're welcome ;)
[08:07:12] <decx> how many max SendQ exceeded can you get before a k-line, cmon freenode
[08:16:37] <lasha> hey guys, i have a question regarding promises (jquery)
[08:16:59] <shoky> yay promises
[08:17:16] <minttu> NOOoooooooooooo!
[08:18:08] <shoky> >:-|
[08:18:38] <jedimind> should talk to my ex girlfriend about promises.
[08:19:09] <shoky> jedimind is there still someone you want banned?
[08:19:48] <jedimind> thealanwattsriot was just pinging out repeatedly
[08:19:52] <jedimind> seems to have stopped now
[08:19:58] <shoky> o
[08:20:03] <jedimind> thx tho
[08:20:15] <shoky> well that's what ignore joins/parts/quits is for, no?
[08:20:48] <jedimind> shoky yeah but if i disable that, then how will i know when you grace us with your presence? :)
[08:21:22] <shoky> heh ;] seems impossible to enjoy freenode without enabling it
[08:21:24] <shoky> to me
[08:21:57] <igcewieling> Form validation makes herding cats look easy.
[08:22:23] <shoky> herding cats will never look easy
[08:23:00] <decx> jquery-validate.js works well for me
[08:24:51] <jedimind> igcewieling html5 validation + polyfill
[08:24:54] <jedimind> problem solved.
[08:25:52] <igcewieling> correction, Form validation on forms with complicated interdependences of fields makes herding cats look easy.
[08:33:24] <decx> what's a good polyfill for a spinbox on input type=number? https://github.com/jonstipe/number-polyfill/blob/master/number-polyfill.js seems ridiculously big
[08:34:59] <decx> right now i just roll my own function without type=number and do that in a couple of lines
[08:36:30] <BillCriswell> decx: I'd probably take your route haha.
[08:36:47] <BillCriswell> Holy crap that's a lot of codde.
[08:37:29] <decx> it has to do all the edgecases if my script would have to do that it would probably be long as well, but for a specific use it seems ridiculous
[08:38:06] <decx> when does it stop being a polyfill and start being a library ;)
[08:43:31] <delboy1978uk> i am sending a ton of emails through an ajax call, i need to delay each mail so i dont hang the server, how can i get it to repeat until all records have been done? http://pastie.org/8698396
[08:43:48] <delboy1978uk> i thought i almost have it
[08:44:44] <decx> i'm not a security guy but exposing email functionality like this doesn't seem like a good idea
[08:45:47] <delboy1978uk> its ok its in a cms area for the superuser]
[08:46:33] <delboy1978uk> it doesnt appear to wait
[08:46:38] <decx> ah, ok. well looks good to me with the timeout
[08:47:07] <shoky> the loop finishes instantly
[08:47:19] <decx> mybe put the timeout in a separate function an call this isntead
[08:47:26] <shoky> all timeouts run after 500ms, and by that time x is already at its final value
[08:47:26] <decx> then it'll wait for the function to be finished
[08:48:39] <decx> ah
[08:59:41] <delboy1978uk> shoky ah ok cheers! boss has moved me onto something else (again :-s) but i'll sort that tomorrow cheers
[09:10:23] <lianzinho> guys, I have this callback call from a plugin, how can I use it? how to access page_num + 1 inside the function? --> http://jsfiddle.net/frmQd/
[09:12:07] <duch_kazatel> lianzinho what's the plugin?
[09:12:24] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel: https://github.com/wesnolte/Pajinate/blob/master/jquery.pajinate.js
[09:12:44] <lianzinho> l:250
[09:13:07] <lianzinho> I don't know how to use the argument in the function
[09:13:09] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/wesnolte/Pajinate/blob/master/jquery.pajinate.js#l250 ?
[09:13:40] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel: yes
[09:14:04] <duch_kazatel> doesn't look like that method is meant to be publically available to you.
[09:15:04] <lianzinho> look at the comment of the author about this… onPageDisplayed: Function(pageNumber), This function will be called if it exists and passed the current page number.
[09:15:41] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel: from here: https://github.com/wesnolte/Pajinate
[09:16:26] <lianzinho> I thought about somenthin like: onPageDisplayed : function(){} but I don't know how to use the argument inside of it
[09:16:47] <duch_kazatel> i know how github works :)  i'm not seeing any documentation that says that's a publicly available method.  if it is, it'll likely be something like this: $('#id_of_page_container').pajinate(onPage: functionName);
[09:16:57] <duch_kazatel> or $('#id_of_page_container').pajinate(onPage: (function(){})());
[09:17:50] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel: well… what is the purpose of a callback if it's not public then? I mean, how should I use it instead
[09:18:04] <duch_kazatel> it might be for internal use?
[09:18:28] <lianzinho> then I must create if inside the plugin core?
[09:18:38] <lianzinho> I will try...
[09:19:19] <duch_kazatel> did you even try my syntax?
[09:23:02] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel: onPage ?
[09:24:08] <duch_kazatel> lianzinho yeah.
[09:25:01] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel: I don't see how it could word, the name of the method is onPageDisplayed isn't it? why onPage would work?
[09:26:39] <duch_kazatel> then change it?
[09:27:13] <duch_kazatel> replace onPage to onPageDisplayed in my example
[09:30:22] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel: this is the first thing I tried, but how could I access the parameter value inside the function?
[09:31:59] <duch_kazatel> lianzinho define a function that takes two args - first one will be this, second one will be the page + 1 or whatever it is, then use this callback syntax:  $('#id_of_page_container').pajinate(onPageDisplayed: functionName);
[09:32:00] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel: (function(){})()) <-- if I use this, won't the function being invoked twice? Tha call is already invoking it, isn't it?
[09:33:40] <duch_kazatel> see what i just put.
[09:33:42] <jop008> I have <select name="male" id="male" data-role="slider" data-mini="true" class='required'>              <option value="on" selected>Man</option>              <option value="off">Vrouw</option>            </select>
[09:33:50] <duch_kazatel> `paste @ jop008
[09:33:50] <b-ot> jop008: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:34:02] <jop008> How to make male the default choice?
[09:34:21] <jop008> only 1 line of code easier to put it right here less manual
[09:34:38] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel: int's the this an obligatory argument of the call function? i must not be in the function that will be called
[09:35:52] <duch_kazatel> lianzinho the plugin calls the functiuon with two args.
[09:36:40] <lasha> crap. sorry guts...
[09:36:44] <lasha> i was gonna ask about promises lol
[09:36:52] <lasha> so say i have an ajax call
[09:37:01] <lasha> and i have a "success" function define
[09:37:09] <lasha> inside that function there's all sorts of logic going on
[09:37:16] <duch_kazatel> jop008 your question is easy - att selected="selected" to whatever dropdown you want.
[09:37:18] <lasha> utilizing variables from the scope in which that ajax call was made
[09:37:19] <duch_kazatel> *menu item
[09:37:41] <jop008> I do have this already
[09:37:58] <jop008> oh no see what you mean
[09:38:10] <lasha> when using ajax calls that strictly return promises, then executing a single .then() or .done() method after .when(), how do you get that function to do all the logic as well?
[09:38:23] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel: no… the first "this" is an obligatory argument to the 'call' function… just the other one is really passed to the function being invoked… take a look at the definition of call: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[09:39:17] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel: but I thank for your help, it worked using the first syntax you suggested, with only one argument in the definition though
[09:39:47] <fabioportieri> lasha: var myajax = $.ajax..... ;   $.when(myajax).done(function() { ... });
[09:40:23] <lasha> fabioportieri: yes i'm familiar with that
[09:40:46] <fabioportieri> lasha: i don't understand what logic you talking?
[09:40:48] <lasha> fabioportieri: except, what if each $.ajax call had stuff happening within its success function?
[09:41:25] <duch_kazatel> lianzinho it's early :)
[09:42:19] <jop008> Won't work <select name="male" id="male" data-role="slider" data-mini="true" class='required'><option value="on" selected="selected">Man</option><option value="off">Vrouw</option>
[09:42:32] <jop008> how to set male as default value
[09:42:33] <duch_kazatel> jop008 fiddle please.
[09:42:38] <fabioportieri> lasha: done is for success, .fail for error, right?
[09:43:36] <LundyChop> http://jsfiddle.net/AS9dG/ for some reason its saying "done" but not hiding the form and reshowing the span :/ anyone able to help ?
[09:43:49] <jop008> fiddle select question <select name="male" id="male" data-role="slider" data-mini="true" class='required'><option value="on" selected="selected">Man</option><option value="off">Vrouw</option>
[09:44:04] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/115/
[09:44:41] <duch_kazatel> jop008 that's working for m.e
[09:44:43] <duch_kazatel> *me
[09:45:17] <jop008> man must be the default that is male in dutch
[09:45:22] <jop008> Vrouw = female
[09:45:45] <duch_kazatel> so on load the toggle should say "man", right?
[09:45:57] <jop008> yes
[09:46:02] <jop008> and selected
[09:46:03] <duch_kazatel> that's what it says for me.
[09:46:11] <jop008> so blue
[09:46:40] <duch_kazatel> no.  i think you are confused.
[09:47:07] <duch_kazatel> that's a function of the styling based on the order things display: http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/118/
[09:47:10] <jop008> I have gray and man
[09:49:33] <LundyChop> :X anyone able to shed some light on my problem?
[09:52:35] <duch_kazatel> LundyChop probably because $(this) is not what you think it is.
[09:53:04] <duch_kazatel> also - .bind() is deprecated.  use .on() instead.
[09:53:12] <LundyChop> :(
[09:53:42] <LundyChop> ok, so what should I be using then?
[09:53:49] <duch_kazatel> where?
[09:54:03] <LundyChop>   $(this).hide().prev('span').show();
[09:54:37] <fabioportieri> LundyChop: http://jsfiddle.net/AS9dG/2/
[09:54:39] <duch_kazatel> what do you expect $(this) to be
[09:54:39] <duch_kazatel> ?
[09:55:44] <LundyChop> i was hoping it ment $this form :P but im daft
[09:56:23] <duch_kazatel> nope.  $(this) in that context is the ajax call.  since you're all ready using an ID for #save, try something like this: jsfiddle.net/AS9dG/1/
[09:58:25] <fabioportieri> again, it's late and i'm still at work..shit.
[09:59:13] <duch_kazatel> yuck
[10:02:02] <LundyChop> duch_kazatel, that is only hiding the Save button
[10:02:03] <LundyChop> not the form
[10:03:02] <fabioportieri> LundyChop: have you seen my fiddle??
[10:03:18] <fabioportieri> [18:54] <fabioportieri> LundyChop: http://jsfiddle.net/AS9dG/2/
[10:03:30] <fabioportieri> there, with a spoon
[10:03:38] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[10:03:47] <LundyChop> :)
[10:03:51] * LundyChop opens mouth 
[10:03:52] <duch_kazatel> that's why i prefer to point people in the right direction instead.
[10:04:31] <fabioportieri> duch_kazatel: yea if i do it and people don't ever notice, what's the purpose, lol
[10:04:41] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:04:44] <duch_kazatel> oh, hah
[10:11:06] <lasha> fabioportieri: so like
[10:11:19] <lasha> i have three ajax calls stored in variables
[10:11:25] <lasha> call1, call2, call3
[10:11:34] <lasha> each one has a success function
[10:14:51] <lasha> say i have
[10:15:18] <lasha> function wrapperFunction(){ …….3 ajax calls here……… }
[10:15:37] <lasha> so wrapperFunction also has variables and stuff defined in the same scope as $.ajax() calls
[10:15:46] <lasha> and the success functions of thsoe 3 ajax calls
[10:15:49] <lasha> use thsoe variables
[10:16:19] <lasha> but now, when, elsewhere, i have my $.when().done(function(){……123…....}) happening
[10:16:41] <lasha> where "123" is, there's no access to those variables from the wrapperFunction scope
[10:22:17] <EminenceHC> Does anyone know of a good program for mac that splits one large XML file into smaller XML files?
[10:23:13] <olsonea> hi folks, i'm just starting to scratch the surface of jquery. one thing i've read is that it
[10:23:29] <olsonea> it's generally safer to use jQuery() rather than $()
[10:23:35] <olsonea> is that popular wisdom?
[10:23:37] <duch_kazatel> "safer"?
[10:24:26] <olsonea> duch_kazatel: like in case of conflicts
[10:24:44] <NickNaeluh> yoo
[10:25:34] <duch_kazatel> olsonea that's only if you're shotgunning in libraries.
[10:25:37] <duch_kazatel> you shouldn't need to.
[10:26:18] <duch_kazatel> olsonea use $ and be a cool kid.
[10:26:29] <olsonea> lol ok thanks :)
[10:26:39] <lasha> other libraries besides jquery also use $ to invoke it
[10:26:48] <lasha> that's why jQuery() exists
[10:26:54] <lasha> does the same exact thing
[10:29:08] <duch_kazatel> if that'
[10:29:31] <duch_kazatel> *if you're getting prevented from using $, use jQuery(function($) {{});
[10:29:50] <duch_kazatel> jQuery(function($) {{/* now you can use $ normally */});
[10:49:20] <lianzinho> guys what would be the nicest way to check for classes like this $('.sel1,.sel2').hasClass('class_for_sel1','class_for_sel2')
[10:49:30] <lianzinho> are there anything like that?
[10:49:59] <duch_kazatel> huh?has
[10:50:15] <duch_kazatel> you mean you want to check if multiple items have a class?
[10:50:33] <duch_kazatel> or if multiple items have multiple classes?
[10:50:50] <lianzinho> if item1 has class1 and item2 has class2
[10:50:51] <lianzinho> hehehe
[10:51:18] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to test each individually in that case.
[10:51:26] <lianzinho> I guess an OR clause will do it, won't it?
[10:51:30] <lianzinho> first || second
[10:54:40] <duch_kazatel> not with what you want.
[10:54:51] <duch_kazatel> .hasClass() takes one classname.
[10:56:48] <lianzinho> got it
[10:56:53] <lianzinho> worked already
[10:56:59] <lianzinho> now, another one
[10:57:11] <lianzinho> how can I remove an event handle from an element?
[10:57:37] <duch_kazatel> .off();
[10:57:52] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/off/
[10:59:25] <olsonea> ok, so next question: what am i doing wrong here? i on click into a <tr> i want to set class="highlight".  $("tr").on("click", function() {$(this).closest("tr").children("th,td").addClass("highlight");});
[10:59:35] <duch_kazatel> `paste @ olsonea
[10:59:35] <b-ot> olsonea: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:00:04] <decx> closest looks up the tree and your click is already on the tr as $(this)
[11:01:36] <decx> also it would be cleaner to on apply the highlight class once to the tr instead of looking for children
[11:02:43] <olsonea> does clicking on a th/td within a tr count as a tr click?
[11:03:00] <olsonea> duch_kazatel: sorry
[11:07:37] <lianzinho> duch_kazatel: you are the man! ahahaha, thanks
[11:08:19] <duch_kazatel> np.
[11:19:16] <jsharpminor> Is it possible to use jQuery to count the number of children that are display:block and not display:none?
[11:20:48] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[11:21:37] <duch_kazatel> wait maybe not.
[11:23:41] <decx> $('div:visible').length
[11:24:18] <asido> I have a click handler on a DOM object. once it triggers, event.target contains not the object I have binded the handler to, but it's children. how can I retrieve the top element the handler was binded to?
[11:25:51] <decx> jsharpminor http://jsfiddle.net/decx/3r3UA/
[11:26:10] <shoky> asido: depending on how the binding was done,  "this" or "event.currentTarget" or "event.delegateTarget"
[11:28:29] <jsharpminor> decx: thanks a million
[11:30:49] <asido> shoky, thanks
[11:44:03] <blaster3> how can I execute a function after resizable drop
[11:44:05] <blaster3> ?
[11:46:42] <decx> what's resizable drop
[11:46:43] <Whiskey> I try to reload image after x seconds, $("img.toggleable").attr("src","index.php?db='.$_GET['db'].'&uid='.$_GET['uid'].'&image=1" is there something wrong in that code as it not happens anything, i know that the link is correct as i checked it
[11:47:26] <phr34k> say, i'm trying to use ajax to query, for a generated json document http://pastebin.com/a4MvsVE1 - but i'm always hitting the error alert (while the server generates status code 200, and mime type is application/json
[11:48:10] <phr34k> is there anything that i'm doing wrong in my code, that causes the error, instead of succes case.
[11:52:00] <Whiskey> works on fiddle to thats strange
[11:59:07] <Hackwar> hi folks, I have an image which URL I want to cycle through on hover. On onMouseOut, the image should return to its original image. How would I do that in the best way?
[12:08:03] <lasha> Hackwar: funny you ask
[12:08:16] <lasha> i actually built a solution to something similar a little while ago
[12:08:18] <lasha> wanna see it?
[12:08:30] <decx> save the extra image in a data-attribute and change img src on mouseenter, mouseleave
[12:09:11] <decx> something like this maybe http://jsfiddle.net/decx/6zYxK/
[12:13:53] <lasha> can't find the fiddle, ugh
[12:16:42] <rtopliffe> Does anyone know why offset() returns an different object every other time it's called? Eg, 1. {top: 16}   2. {top: 264}   3. {top: 16:}   4. {top: 264} http://jsbin.com/iBIKOWa/2/edit?html,js,output
[12:19:25] <shoky> rtopliffe: because the offset keeps changing, because the scroll keeps changing it ;p
[12:21:55] <rtopliffe> shoky: ahh you're right, thanks ^^;
[12:22:16] <shoky> rtopliffe:  add a '+='  before the scrollTop value
[12:22:37] <shoky> scrollTop: '+=' + $('#cursor').offset().top
[12:23:30] <remyo> Whats the best way to remove duplicate classes on a page without specifying the class?
[12:23:52] <shoky> what does removing a class mean?
[12:24:25] <remyo> For example, if I page has multiple <div class="item"> and I want to hide() them.
[12:24:33] <remyo> Without specifying the class item.
[12:24:40] <rtopliffe> shoky: ok I can't find that in the docs, can you example why "+=" is needed?
[12:24:57] <shoky> remyo that would require looping over all elements in the DOM
[12:25:31] <shoky> rtopliffe:  because the cursor position is the delta that you want to change the scrollTop by
[12:25:57] <shoky> i.e. if cursor position is 0, you don't want to change the scrollTop at all
[12:26:13] <shoky> so += 0
[12:26:33] <shoky> rtopliffe: and it's in the docs for .animate
[12:26:43] <remyo> shoky: Or the duplicate removal could happen within a specific tag. I guess I'm basically asking how to target classes in general without being specific.
[12:27:13] <shoky> remyo: you can't target them, you can only loop through all elements and check what classes each of them has
[12:27:18] <shoky> and filter based on that
[12:27:23] <remyo> I see
[12:27:31] <rtopliffe> shoky: ok I understand now, thanks again :)
[12:40:53] <BillCriswell> Never realized how much I disliked Dreamweaver till today.
[12:41:38] <duch_kazatel> oh god what a terrible application.
[12:42:14] <BillCriswell> We are forced to use it for this one project. Nearly kills my machine.
[12:42:22] <duch_kazatel> yuck.
[12:42:27] <duch_kazatel> wait why are you "forced" to?
[12:42:31] <decx> i thought it was better now?
[12:42:33] <BillCriswell> It is a huge project though. There's like 14,000 files in this shit
[12:42:59] <decx> havent used it in 10+ years tho, but back then it was shit. yes
[12:51:02] <duch_kazatel> I just recreated the marquee effect in javascript.
[12:51:08] <duch_kazatel> i feel "dertay"
[12:52:47] <decx> shouldve used css3 animation infinite
[12:53:01] <duch_kazatel> that supported in IE8?
[12:53:07] <decx> fuck ie8
[12:53:22] <duch_kazatel> a huge amount of our end users are on IE8 and IE9.
[12:53:43] <duch_kazatel> they give us money. we'd rather not lose them.
[12:54:02] <Shero> do you know how to append an <li> within a <ul>, I know to append a text you do $("ul").append("Hello");
[12:54:03] <decx> ye conversion rates for ie people are always great
[12:54:24] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[12:54:52] <duch_kazatel> shero $('ul')
[12:55:16] <duch_kazatel> err, $('ul').append($('<li>lol</li>'));
[12:55:24] <duch_kazatel> that's one way at least.
[12:56:04] <Shero> Thanks
[12:56:22] <decx> don't do it in an each though ;)
[12:56:31] <duch_kazatel> neverrrr!
[12:56:34] <duch_kazatel> never use an each!
[12:56:47] <duch_kazatel> i will stab a fool for using each.
[12:56:58] <blackmesa> Hi all. I am using a loading.gif in my ajax submit params. I want the loading.gif to at least show 2 seconds. Anybody can tell me how to set a timeout or something. My line is this    beforeSend: function() { $('#loading').html("<img src='/images/loading.gif' />"); },
[12:57:05] <decx> you're using jquery though, which is like 40% .each
[12:57:07] <decx> ^^
[12:57:29] <duch_kazatel> i avoid using it myself.
[12:57:41] <duch_kazatel> blackmesa why would you force user to wait at least 2 seconds?
[12:58:02] <duch_kazatel> in a world where everybody else is making users wait less and less, you want them to wait more?
[12:58:38] <retep007> Hi guys can someone explain me this ? Ive got error  Cannot read property 'url' of null  on this line if(event.state.url !==null)
[12:58:59] <duch_kazatel> retep007 that means event.state doesn't exists.
[12:59:00] <duch_kazatel> *exist
[12:59:23] <retep007> oh so i should first check for event.state ?
[12:59:33] <duch_kazatel> if it's not guaranteed to exist, yes
[13:00:25] <lior_> if I call this.$el.hide() can I still use it ?
[13:00:38] <duch_kazatel> lior_ define "use it"
[13:00:45] <retep007> I thought it would return false if it doesnt exit at all, but thanks for help its working now
[13:00:57] <retep007> *exist
[13:00:57] <lior_> like i am using spin.js and it requires targeting an element
[13:01:04] <lior_> and then being able to put a spinner around it
[13:01:18] <lior_> so trying to see if i hide it, can i still target it
[13:01:19] <duch_kazatel> all .hide() does is set display: none; on it.
[13:01:36] <Shero> hey duch, how about if I want to give it an id to add it to a specific ul $('ul').append($('<li>lol</li>'));
[13:01:54] <duch_kazatel> "give it an id to add it to a specific ul" huh?
[13:01:58] <duch_kazatel> have a code example?
[13:01:59] <lior_> oh so if i used a spinner around it, the display might be hidden hm
[13:02:20] <decx> Shero you should read up on the jquery basics, targeting an id is the first thing you'll learn
[13:02:34] <Shero> so $('ul').append($('<li>lol</li>')); will add it to every ul in the page
[13:02:47] <Shero> there are many <ul> tags in the page
[13:02:58] <Shero> so I could add an id or class
[13:03:45] <duch_kazatel> Shero are you really not sure how to target an ID or Class?
[13:03:52] <duch_kazatel> that's selector 101
[13:03:55] <decx> $('#id') $('.class') $('[attribute]')
[13:04:07] <duch_kazatel> don't give out the answer!!!
[13:04:08] <duch_kazatel> :(
[13:04:13] <decx> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[13:04:35] <GuffyJarvis> if I have an image inside of a div and the div has opacity set - how can I make the image's opacity overwrite the div? I've set the opacity of the image and it's not working
[13:04:57] <duch_kazatel> "make the image's opacity overwrite the div" - change your phrasing.
[13:06:26] <decx> GuffyJarvis the image's opacity doesn't matter as long as its parent is still invisible
[13:07:24] <GuffyJarvis> I'm guessing that setting the opacity on an element will change the opacity of all contained elements within it, so i have to remove it from that element
[13:09:07] <GuffyJarvis> dec <div style='opactiy=.5'><img></div> makes the image have .5 opacity
[13:09:44] <BillCriswell> GuffyJarvis: I think you want : instead of =.
[13:10:17] <decx> if you just want to have a half transparent background use css background: rgba(250,250,250,0.5)
[13:10:24] <BillCriswell> GuffyJarvis: Do you just want the divs background color to be transparent?
[13:10:28] <BillCriswell> ah decx beat me to it.
[13:10:52] <GuffyJarvis> thanks decx i'll give that a shot
[13:11:07] <GuffyJarvis> yep bill that's what i want
[13:12:39] <Spami> Hello
[13:13:09] <GuffyJarvis> that did the trick thanks again
[13:14:26] <decx> don't forget to set a fallback background before for browsers that don't support rgba
[13:15:18] <BillCriswell> Yeah, that'll work in IE9+
[13:16:48] <decx> yeah you'd have to use a filter:progid:DXImage..... abomination to support lower
[13:17:00] <decx> yuk
[13:20:12] <GuffyJarvis> I'm only developing for IE9+ - anyone using IE8 can go f themselves
[13:20:15] <GuffyJarvis> :)
[13:20:50] <therealklanni> someone refresh my memory, in the jqXHR object received in a fail callback, responseText will always be "", is that correct?
[13:21:17] <shoky> nope
[13:21:32] <therealklanni> When would it not be blank?
[13:21:47] <shoky> when the response body isn't blank
[13:22:19] <shoky> at least.. if i'm not mistaken
[13:22:40] <therealklanni> I'm not sure that's right (could be, just not how I remember it)
[13:23:23] <therealklanni> You get the statusText (i.e. "Not found") and statusCode, but I don't remember there ever being a value for responseText
[13:23:54] <therealklanni> Pretty sure it's there for when it's a successful server response
[13:24:18] <shoky> therealklanni here's one contrived example  http://jsfiddle.net/6G7jJ/
[13:26:04] <therealklanni> Hmm
[13:26:13] <therealklanni> Doesn't seem typical for an API, though
[13:26:35] <therealklanni> API's don't usually serve up HTML on a failed call
[13:26:45] <shoky> indeed
[13:26:50] <shoky> that's a different question tho ;p
[13:27:32] <therealklanni> So I guess my question is... if an API responds in a standard way (i.e. 5XX or 4XX code) would anything appear in responseText?
[13:27:42] <shoky> same answer...
[13:31:19] <Tiin57> Does anyone know why a page with the contents "<?php echo($_COOKIE['test']); ?>" doesn't have any content when accessed via $.get(), but it does when I access it from the browser?
[13:38:50] <BillCriswell> Tiin57: https?
[13:39:00] <Tiin57> No
[13:39:45] <BillCriswell> Same domain?
[13:41:33] <Tiin57> Yeah
[13:42:22] <BillCriswell> Are you sure the request is successful?
[13:42:37] <BillCriswell> Like do you see the request being made in the network panel and all.
[13:42:42] <Tiin57> Yeah.
[13:42:54] <Tiin57> Everything works except the cookies
[13:51:46] <Spami> Anyone knows how to get rid of the white space ? I've been trying without success  http://cl.ly/image/0Q1v0s0N2N0W
[13:54:36] <NickNaeluh> hi
[13:55:13] <NickNaeluh> Spami: width ?
[13:56:10] <Spami> NickNaeluh, yes, I have the right code("$(".gm-style-iw").prev("div").children().last().css("width", '351px');") but it's being called before the infowindow is loaded si it's ineffective
[13:56:42] <NickNaeluh> so then call it after right ?
[13:56:58] <Spami> yes but I don't know when the info window is loaded
[13:57:44] <NickNaeluh> can you look at the inspect element and see what is setting it in the console.log of the object ?
[13:58:11] <Spami> sure, I'm not sure how to do that
[13:59:52] <NickNaeluh> set this to a variable test = $(".gm-style-iw").prev("div").children().last().css("width", '351px');
[14:00:01] <NickNaeluh> console.log(test);
[14:00:40] <NickNaeluh> then check the console to see what you have from that
[14:01:17] <NickNaeluh> but play around with it and see what you can find from test the values of the variables and you can find what and where is setting the value
[14:01:29] <NickNaeluh> test = $(".gm-style-iw");
[14:01:35] <NickNaeluh> maybe even that
[14:02:42] <Spami> thanks NickNaeluh I'll try to play around
[14:02:58] <NickNaeluh> yeah I can take a look too if you show more code
[14:03:29] <NickNaeluh> I am currently depressed and feel like helping out cause its been a rough day haha
[14:05:02] <decx> helping people can really pull you out of a slump
[14:05:38] <NickNaeluh> decx: you got that right
[14:31:25] <tr3y> what's wrong with this code? $(".refreshMe").load("http://mydomain.com/wp/wp-content/plugins/myplugin/refreshDiv.php .refreshMe > *");
[14:39:12] <decx> i'm not sure, but i don't think you can use a complex selector as a fragment in load
[14:42:12] <Tiin57> Does anyone know why a page with the contents "<?php echo($_COOKIE['test']); ?>" doesn't have any content when accessed via $.get(), but it does when I access it from the browser?
[14:50:17] <lior_> how do you pick the first child in jquery
[14:51:13] <tw2113> lior_, http://api.jquery.com/first-child-selector/
[14:52:13] <lior_> ok
[14:52:22] <lior_> anyway to do it without callind :first-child inside
[14:52:37] <lior_> for example tw2113 I am doing this.$el
[14:52:46] <lior_> now I want to do this.$el.childsomehow
[14:54:44] <Tiin57> Basically, my problem is that $.get() seems to be using a separate set of cookies than the browser.
[14:55:29] <Cork> Tiin57: no $.get is just a wrapper around $.ajax
[14:55:46] <Cork> and ajax just uses document.XMLHttpRequest
[14:55:47] <Tiin57> Whatever it is, it's using a different set of cookies.
[14:55:53] <Cork> and the browser is the one controling cookies
[14:55:55] <Tiin57> I think.
[14:55:59] <Cork> no
[14:56:02] <Tiin57> Well, I don't know then.
[14:56:05] <lior_> ok I have this $("#es-search [type=submit]") then I want to get it's first child or children does not matter and hide it, how do I do that the class of the child is .ss-search if needed
[14:56:28] <Tiin57> I'll have to look into it some more, test with Ajax and document.XMLHttpRequest
[14:56:40] <Cork> Tiin57: is the ajax call to the same fqdn?
[14:56:48] <Tiin57> fqdn?
[14:56:49] <duch_kazatel> lior_ huh?
[14:57:01] <Cork> Tiin57: Fully Qualified Domain NAme
[14:57:04] <Cork> *Name
[14:57:14] <lior_> basically the way I select the parent element is like so
[14:57:18] <lior_> $("#es-search [type=submit]")
[14:57:21] <Tiin57> Uh, no. It's test.* as opposed to *
[14:57:31] <lior_> it has a child element that I am trying to call .hide() on
[14:57:40] <Cork> Tiin57: check so the browser doesn't block third party cookies then
[14:57:47] <Tiin57> Okay.
[14:58:01] <Cork> Tiin57: optionally you can set document.domain
[14:58:11] <Tiin57> Oh. That could work.
[14:58:14] <lior_> if this is the parent basically and I need to select the child how do i select it $("#es-search [type=submit]")
[14:58:38] <vinky> lior_, what's wrong with adding :first-child?
[14:58:40] <lior_> and the child's class is .ss-search, element name is <i></i>
[14:58:46] <wunz> hi, i am trying to only obtain the information once in this code unless there are more quotes but its calling the .each multiple times: http://jsfiddle.net/2tRhg/1/
[14:58:47] <lior_> it doesnt work : /
[14:58:50] <wunz> what am i doing wrong?
[14:58:57] <duch_kazatel> $("#es-search [type=submit]").find('.ss-search');
[14:59:07] <lior_> like this right ?$("#es-search [type=submit] :first-child")
[14:59:30] <duch_kazatel> lior_ could you share your markup in a fiddle?
[14:59:38] <lior_> ya
[14:59:53] <duch_kazatel> because what I pasted will work, but I'm not sure how great it'll be for your use case.
[15:01:27] <lior_> @duch_kazatel http://jsfiddle.net/CGL7r/
[15:01:33] <lior_> that is the html now I am trying to get
[15:02:19] <lior_> line 18 and hide it
[15:02:21] <wunz> can anyone help?
[15:02:21] <lior_> ><i class="ss-search" data-view="spinnerView" data-collection="results"></i>
[15:02:40] <duch_kazatel> then yeah, the code I supplied will work.
[15:04:01] <lior_> can u show me
[15:04:12] <lior_> damn the icon wont show tho hm
[15:04:23] <duch_kazatel> wunz i gave you literal copy/paste code.
[15:04:33] <duch_kazatel> $("#es-search [type=submit]").find('.ss-search');
[15:04:36] <duch_kazatel> err, lior_
[15:04:45] <duch_kazatel> wunz, the each is running once.
[15:04:54] <lior_> yeah?
[15:05:13] <lior_> I can cut the code down more if it helps but trying to think how to include something in the button
[15:05:31] <duch_kazatel> lior_ huh?  that snippet will work perfectly.
[15:05:33] <wunz> duch_kazatel: so why does it print multiple tr ?
[15:05:34] <duch_kazatel> as-is.
[15:05:43] <lior_> $("#es-search [type=submit] :first-child").hide();
[15:05:44] <lior_> this?
[15:05:46] <wunz> since there's only one quote returned but multiple elements of that quote
[15:05:58] <duch_kazatel> lior_ $("#es-search [type=submit]").find('.ss-search').hide()
[15:06:01] <wunz> lior_: yes as he mentioned.
[15:06:30] <duch_kazatel> wunz it's running for each prop in iffe@198-91-223-215.cpe.distributel.net) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[15:06:30] <duch_kazatel> [2014:02:04:15:05:13] <lior_> I can cut t
[15:06:33] <duch_kazatel> woops.
[15:06:44] <lior_> hm it is not working for some reason this
[15:06:50] <duch_kazatel> data.query.results.quote - $.each() runs on each prop of this.
[15:06:52] <wunz> lol duch_kazatel bad c/p huh
[15:06:55] <duch_kazatel> yeah
[15:06:56] <lior_> let me try one more thing
[15:07:02] <wunz> oh thats why
[15:07:20] <wunz> guess it should be: $.each(data.query.results
[15:07:24] <wunz> vs adding the quote at the end
[15:07:48] <wunz> yup that fixed it, thx ;p sometimes just need an extra eye
[15:07:53] <lior_> hm wth...
[15:08:04] <wunz> lior_: what do you want to do?
[15:08:09] <wunz> hide what?
[15:08:12] <wunz> the search box?
[15:08:28] <lior_> the problem is im using backbone and this.$el selects the whole button and if i remove it - it breaks the spinner
[15:08:35] <lior_> but if i remove the icon on the inside im golden
[15:08:42] <lior_> remove meaning hide
[15:08:59] <lior_> but for some reason I cannot grab the icon... driving me nuts
[15:09:06] <lior_> spending like 30 min trying 10 things on it too
[15:09:48] <wunz> http://jsfiddle.net/CGL7r/ <-- the little thing to the right after the search box?
[15:10:12] <lior_> ah nvm i see the issue i think
[15:10:28] <vinky> can you really have non-text inside a button?
[15:10:42] <wunz> vinky: sure, why can't you?
[15:10:52] <wunz> that's what css is for
[15:11:10] <lior_> it is an icon class
[15:11:20] <duch_kazatel> you can use glyphicons to do it, yeah.
[15:12:10] <lior_> i actually am having a more difficult task because now i realize im actually using the icon
[15:12:15] <lior_> to run the spinner
[15:12:28] <lior_> but if i try to target the parent to run the spinner it doesn't let me
[15:12:49] <lior_> can i do a .parent call?
[15:13:15] <duch_kazatel> lior_ i'd go check out the api documentation.
[15:13:32] <duch_kazatel> lior_ it'll answer all these questions for you.
[15:14:21] <lior_> http://fgnass.github.io/spin.js/
[15:14:34] <lior_> it is this doc and the documentation does not specify that being an issue
[15:15:28] <nicetry> Is it possible to figure out if an element of a list is visible, when the <ul> exists inside a a scrolling div (one with a height set smaller than the ul, but with overflow: scroll-x set)?
[15:15:55] <nicetry> There seem to be a lot of plugins to do this when the viewport is the window, but not when you have a smaller scrolling area
[15:16:17] <wunz> if i have an array var a = ['a','b']; what's the best way to join it to output: ("a", "b")
[15:17:02] <vinky> wunz, I dont see how css entered the picture, but upon reading about it <button> can have tags, input cant
[15:17:20] <wunz> guess it was off topic then, was thinking something else
[15:34:55] <shoky> wunz: donno if its best way but it sure does work:  '(' + a.map(function(s){ return '"' + s + '"'; }).join(', ') + ')'
[15:39:36] <JovanJ> a
[15:40:15] <JovanJ> Does someone knows how  I can fix dialog box on some dimension?
[15:40:25] <JovanJ> so he stays in one place if I scroll page down and up?
[15:41:35] <duch_kazatel> JovanJ position: fixed;
[15:42:45] <JovanJ> duch_kazatel , where should I define that?
[15:43:48] <JovanJ> when i try in function, dialog box collaps
[15:44:32] <duch_kazatel> JovanJ in your CSS?
[15:46:15] <JovanJ> duch_kazatel  , i am using jquery-ui.css for style of dialog box, are you maybe aware where is it defined, like i just can not find it
[15:47:49] <duch_kazatel> JovanJ what's the ID for your nav?
[15:48:12] <JovanJ> duch_kazatel
[15:48:17] <JovanJ> dialog1
[15:48:17] <JovanJ> ^
[15:49:01] <duch_kazatel> in your css file, put this: #dialog1 {position: fixed;}
[15:50:07] <JovanJ> duch_kazatel , when I do that dialog still moves, and background collaps -.-
[15:50:34] <duch_kazatel> sounds like jquery ui is doing some funk to the menu, then.  weird.
[15:54:22] <JovanJ> duch_kazatel , do you know maybe how i can open dialog box near button? because if i put some dimensions like [200,300], again he is moving... is it because of that position?
[15:55:08] <duch_kazatel> JovanJ can you make a jsfiddle of it?
[15:56:02] <JovanJ> duch_kazatel , i'll try , not so familiar with js ...
[15:57:14] <duch_kazatel> JovanJ it's easy - select the appropriate libraries in the far-left menu, put your HTML fragment in the HTML box, your relevant javascript in the javascript box, and the appropriate CSS in the css box.
[15:57:22] <duch_kazatel> then save it.
[16:00:31] <JovanJ> duch_kazatel
[16:00:32] <JovanJ> http://jsfiddle.net/hbhrF/
[16:01:08] <decx> JovanJ http://jsfiddle.net/decx/6KYVG/
[16:17:49] <JovanJ> duch_kazatel, somehow I can click on dialog box, and move it from one side to another, how I can disable that?
[16:27:17] <duch_kazatel> JovanJ http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-draggable
[16:27:23] <duch_kazatel> JovanJ http://jsfiddle.net/6KYVG/1/
[16:28:30] <duch_kazatel> rtfm
[16:29:28] <decx> my guess is most people stop at the example page and never use the tiny Api Documentation Link that leads right to the heart of the actual documentation
[16:29:38] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[16:30:28] <Tanner_> I'm wondering if someone can help me understand something in my head
[16:30:33] <Tanner_> http://demo.tutorialzine.com/2011/09/shuffle-letters-effect-jquery/assets/js/jquery.shuffleLetters.js
[16:31:11] <Tanner_> can someone explain to me what the })(-options.step); is doing on line 117
[16:37:12] <scrupul0us1> how can I get the count of divs that have a class, within a div with a specific ID? http://pastebin.com/V5ksEwic I want to get the number of "items" within #container...
[16:37:47] <scrupul0us1> i tried $(div#container.items).length
[16:37:50] <Tanner_> $("#foo > div").size()
[16:37:53] <scrupul0us1> i always get 0
[16:37:59] <scrupul0us1> thanks I'll try that
[16:38:17] <Tanner_> $("#container > div").size() in your case
[16:39:07] <scrupul0us1> $("#container > div.items").length worked great... length vs size?
[16:40:20] <scrupul0us1> looks like size is depreciated as of 1.8 in favor of .length
[16:40:23] <scrupul0us1> thank you for your help
[16:40:42] <Tanner_> ah lol probably
[16:40:44] <Tanner_> no porbs
[16:40:52] <scrupul0us1> :-D
[16:40:55] <Tanner_> *probs
[16:43:15] <Linkandzelda> hey guys is there any way to do this without stopping the user from being able to change pages: $.get( "index.php?p=updatebalances");
[16:48:14] <decx> Tanner_ -options.step is -8 an defines the starting index for start in shuffle(start)
[16:50:08] <Tanner_> decx: so in theory it would the same as setting step = -8 before the shuffle(start) function (then not using after)
[16:51:16] <vinex08> yoh guys,, http://jsfiddle.net/V37ky/ how can i make my + change to - when toggled?
[16:51:17] <decx> i don't know exactly what it does, but that's what it does ;)
[16:54:32] <evilbug> decx: yo dude.
[16:54:36] <Tanner_> ok, thanks decx ... hopefully that's enough info for me to crack what I was trying to do lol
[16:55:56] <decx> Tanner_ yeah it's a selfexecuting function that calls itself, here's an easy example http://jsfiddle.net/decx/stu6z/ check the console it starts with -9
[16:56:02] <decx> hi evilbug
[16:56:31] <Tanner_> decx: Great thanks :)
[17:05:06] <vinex08> yoh guys,, http://jsfiddle.net/V37ky/ how can i make my + change to - when toggled?
[17:10:30] <decx> vinex08 http://jsfiddle.net/decx/V37ky/1/
[17:11:19] <decx> oh a var too much
[17:12:11] <decx> thankfully javascript doesnt care
[17:12:38] <decx> for a bit of closure http://jsfiddle.net/decx/V37ky/2/
[17:12:40] <decx> ^^
[17:13:55] <vinex08> thanks man!! i dont understand the code at all :P
[17:14:59] <decx> in the first line we cache the element with the class .jpl-toggle-content that's inside the li element which is clicked into a variable
[17:15:13] <decx> the second is a conditional operator that works like if, else
[17:15:23] <vinex08> ohhh i see!!!
[17:15:29] <vinex08> ? <--- if else?
[17:15:33] <decx> if the inner html of the element is + we set it to -
[17:15:37] <vinex08> the ? and : symbol
[17:15:41] <decx> otherwise we set it to plus
[17:15:57] <decx> (condition) ? yes : no
[17:16:23] <vinex08> what do you call that style of if else statement\
[17:16:26] <vinex08> shorthand?
[17:16:37] <decx> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator
[17:16:49] <decx> or ternary
[17:17:27] <vinex08> i understand it a bit now .. ty
[17:17:28] <decx> comes especially handy when you want to set a variable based on conditions
[17:18:55] <vinex08> return false; <-- what does this do>
[17:19:43] <duch_kazatel> returns false
[17:19:53] <decx> that's only to prevent the standard event, but it does nothing on a li
[17:20:21] <decx> for example on an anchor, it prevents going to the href
[17:20:22] <duch_kazatel> some folks like the "feeling" of always returning from functions.  in javascript, it's not necessary to.
[17:20:24] <vinex08> so its the same with event.preventDefault ????
[17:20:34] <duch_kazatel> in some cases, yes.
[17:20:36] <duch_kazatel> but not all.
[17:20:40] <decx> return false; in jquery does it all
[17:21:23] <decx> because javascript doesn't care
[17:21:25] <duch_kazatel> i prefer explicitly using e.preventDefault(), but you can do either.
[17:21:40] <decx> var undefined = true
[17:21:45] <duch_kazatel> noooooooooooooooooo
[17:21:47] <duch_kazatel> :(
[17:21:57] <duch_kazatel> decx just wants to watch the world burn.
[17:22:00] <decx> ha
[17:22:47] <vinex08> lol
[17:23:09] <decx> duch_kazatel how do i return the right way without each in my plugin boilerplate http://jsfiddle.net/decx/eP4dV/ ?
[17:24:39] <duch_kazatel> you could hand-roll an object, but i hate myself and like writing code like that.
[17:24:53] <decx> lol
[17:25:04] <duch_kazatel> that's actually one of the few cases i'm fine with .each();
[17:25:21] <decx> good to know :)

[17:32:30] <asidjazz> ryanneufeld: 100% dead
[17:32:40] <ryanneufeld> then asking in #jquery isn't likely to help

[18:39:48] <jsharpminor> What's the question?
[18:39:55] <jsharpminor> Oh, nevermind, he left.
[18:41:24] <jsharpminor> How do I find the number of cousins each "uncle" element has?
[18:41:32] <jsharpminor> I have a list with 6 li elements.
[18:42:01] <jsharpminor> I'm adding another li to it, but i want to put it in another ol if there's one with only 5.
[18:42:29] <jsharpminor> I have 4 ol elements, each with an arbitrary and somewhat even number of children.
[18:42:49] <jsharpminor> I want to add another li to list 1, but if list 2 is shorter I want it in list 2 instead
[18:43:45] <jsharpminor> The part where I'm stuck is selecting each individual sibling of my parent element... when there could be 2 siblings or 3
[18:46:27] <vinex08> http://jsfiddle.net/RUxk7/   my toggleClass doesnt work .. what's wrong with it. could you guys check?

[22:31:46] <jordan__> Greeting all
[22:31:47] <jordan__> Wondering if someone suggest me that how to detect closing browser.(is there any plugin/slution for that)
[22:32:10] <jphase> jordan__: you can close the window you're in, but not the browser
[22:32:41] <jordan__> Actually I want to show a custom (Popup/Modal) not browser one to my website users.
[22:33:39] <jphase> well a popup and a modal are different things, perhaps you're looking for a lightbox plugin?
[22:38:46] <kevireilly> vinex08: Sorry for the delay, thank you for holding. There appears to be 3 issues at play, 2 being syntax related. First, on line 5, the click method is not properly closed [} vs });]. Second, the expected key for max-height is maxHeight (most hyphenated keys are camel-case). Then there is a css issue with the present approach after those 2 http://jsfiddle.net/D7qG4/2/
[22:40:50] <VectorX> can i get some help with this http://jsfiddle.net/L4HHL/ basically 2 things needs to happen, A. you can only select one or the other from the 2 turnupthemuisc1.de items,  B. when submitting if both are selected only the DE2 option from the 2 should be enabled, which means the input element id=decat should be removed from the first one so that it is not submitted
[22:41:25] <kevireilly> vinex08: seems you can't animate to auto, but you should be able to animate to a specific maxHeight if you get the real height first. Possibly something like var height = $('#testi-block).height(); but im guessing
[22:42:10] <kevireilly> might need to add px, but yeah that is the last part after javascript isn't halted by a boo boo
[22:42:31] <jphase> VectorX: sounds like a job for a radio element on the .de items
[22:43:08] <jordan__> <jphase> yes, you are right  I need modal which lightbox provides but how to open the lightbox on browser closing event. I know how to open modal by clicking link/image/button etc
[22:43:17] <VectorX> jphase yeah but, im incorporating this into a system where generally there would only be one of those items and you can select multiple to process
[22:44:50] <jphase> jordan__: sounds like you're doing something that I don't personally enjoy as an internet user - but you can look into the "onunload" event. That's as far as I will help you on this. I don't like sites that do what you're doing.
[22:45:49] <GuffyJarvis> Is there another SQL channel besides #SQL? I can't send to channel apparently
[22:46:21] <VectorX> #sql
[22:46:26] <tw2113> GuffyJarvis, did you register your IRC nick with nickserv?
[22:46:49] <GuffyJarvis> tw, yes - for some reason it keeps making me do it though and i'm getting tired of re-registering
[22:47:24] <Jakobud> Does anyone know anything about the new .env.php stuff Taylor recented added to L4?
[22:47:31] <jordan__> <jphase> I too dislike this option, but sometime it is very difficult to make understand the client. Tnx anyway
[22:47:37] <vinex08> kevireilly: http://jsfiddle.net/D7qG4/4/   i want a little bit of smoothness to the transition... unfortunately css transition doesnt work in it
[22:47:57] <VectorX> GuffyJarvis are you loging in after that ?
[22:48:10] <FriendlySeal> omg do u kno any sites that kik u when loged in?
[22:48:36] <jphase> jordan__: the onunload event is what you're looking for, but lighboxes/modals won't work with that since the onunload event you're binding to is the window in which they would appear. A "popup" is the only option there and that resembles a porn site or pirated video site behavior ;)
[22:48:53] <FriendlySeal> i kno 2 websites that does that
[22:49:04] <FriendlySeal> and both aspx
[22:49:13] <FriendlySeal> lool
[22:49:57] <GuffyJarvis> vector: it makes me re-register if i disconnect or idle too long. i'm already logged in when i do it
[22:50:39] <tw2113> are you identifying with nickserv when you log in?
[22:50:54] <tw2113> "yes, this is me, the original person that registered the nickname"
[22:51:01] <tw2113> "here's my password for proof"
[22:51:20] <tw2113> type /ns id *your password*
[22:51:37] <GuffyJarvis> tw, maybe that's expected behavior - i'm new thanks for the explanation
[22:52:02] <tw2113> depending on the irc client you use, you can set it to do that for you upon successful connection
[22:52:17] <GuffyJarvis> I thought someone was hacking me because the first time i did it, it didnt' accept my password and i had to create a new account
[22:52:30] <tw2113> that?i can't say for sure what happened
[22:52:37] <VectorX> so uh, just out of curiosity, when i asked if you were logged in(identified), what exactly where you logged into ?
[22:53:20] <GuffyJarvis> vector - i assumed i was logged in but i guess i wasn't.. my username was working in this channel
[22:54:02] <tw2113> connecting to/logging onto irc != identifying yourself with nickserv
[22:54:09] <VectorX> so i got this so far as the first part, http://jsfiddle.net/L4HHL/3/ , it would be also good if i can assign the click event to items ending with .de instead of "input[name='domains[]']") as a whole
[22:54:15] <tw2113> and not every channel requires you to be registered/identified
[22:54:53] <FriendlySeal> dam
[22:55:12] <VectorX> and now when you click and item, if it is check after clicking, it should uncheck any other checkbox with "turnupthemuisc1.de"(generic) in its value
[22:55:15] <tw2113> are you erecting a dam for an oncoming flood FriendlySeal ?
[22:55:34] <FriendlySeal> o____o
[22:55:52] <tw2113> one that's big enough for a whale???
[22:56:44] <kevireilly_> GuffyJarvis: If you've forgotten your password or it no longer works and your email is associated with the nick, you can ask nicely in #freenode to have your password reset
[22:57:40] <GuffyJarvis> kev thanks good to know
[22:57:54] <jphase> tehehe
[23:06:05] <FriendlySeal> hahaha

[23:47:18] <kevireilly> elmargol: check out weinre
[23:49:32] <elmargol> kevireilly, I don't see how weinre is going to help?
[23:49:41] <elmargol> Do you think the chrome debugger is not working?
[23:50:27] <kevireilly> elmargol: honestly, no clue. But if you've got to troubleshoot javascript and css in the future, it will prolly help
