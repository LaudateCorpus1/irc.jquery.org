[07:14:49] <foo> I have a pager element and I duplicated it so it's on the top / bottom of a div. However, if I do something like this... $('span.o_pager_value')[3].innerHTML = $('span.o_pager_value')[4].innerHTML ... when the bottom pager changes state to update the other pager, the other pager on top doesn't resume from current page if someone advances from that. eg. pager top and bottom. On bottom pager, I advance 1 page.
[07:14:55] <foo> It sets the top pager. Then I go to top pager and advance 1 page. Instead of advancing from current page, it advances from the first page... as if, despite changing innerHTML, it doesn't respect the value. Anyone have a gut instinct on why this might be? Thank you
[07:14:59] * foo is entering hour 23 of a coding sprint and this is the last fix before calling it a day
[07:44:25] <foo> If I see this in console log:  [object Object] - how do I unpack it?
[07:53:42] <Woet> foo: how are you putting it there?
[07:54:24] <foo> Woet: thank you. top and bottom pager: https://paste.ofcode.org/GMaH22BJZFfY6nWUnKmBgg
[07:54:29] <foo> eg. looks like this https://screencast.com/t/p322VG3XP2
[07:54:41] <foo> top was already there, we added bottom, trying to get them to stay in sync
[07:54:46] <Woet> foo: what code did you use to output [object Object] into the console
[07:54:59] <foo> I *think* if I put a pager change state on each of them, and have it say "if the other changes then update myself"
[07:57:27] <foo> Woet: err, I pasted the same https://paste.ofcode.org/3afiWpgKjGfsPrYCyXDtPvy
[07:57:46] <Woet> foo: just use console.log on the element.
[07:57:54] <Woet> s/element/variable/
[07:58:16] <foo> Woet: which variable? (and yes, I am testing with console log to see what value to change)
[07:58:23] <Woet> foo: console.log(this)
[07:58:26] <Woet> foo: console.log(value)
[07:58:29] <foo> ... if I'm following you
[07:58:34] <foo> oh, not toString() ?
[07:58:34] <foo> ok
[09:53:19] <MACscr> hmm, if a if a third party jquery script is setup like so https://www.mapster.me/wp-mapbox-gl-js/wp-content/plugins/wp-mapbox-gl-js/public/js/wp-mapbox-gl-js-public.js, is it even possible for me to externally listen to its events? im trying to perform an action when someone clicks on an icon. Seems its tracked using map.on('click',feature.id,function(e) {....}

[20:35:50] <jaktheleaper_> hello
[20:36:37] <jaktheleaper_> is there a way to add a counter to an audio control?
[20:36:46] <jaktheleaper_> I'm guessing javascript is the way
[20:36:59] <jaktheleaper_> Still decently lost, ended up here..
[20:39:20] <jaktheleaper_> :(
