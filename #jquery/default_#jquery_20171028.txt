[00:17:00] <jak2000> in a jquery-u datepicker is possible cloring days higlight?
[07:59:51] <kim366_> So I have some elements fading at specific intervals between each other, but when I switch away from the tab in my browser and come back, the fading is all out of sync. Is there something like $(document).ready for when the document is focused again after a tab switch?
[08:01:21] <kim366_> Or, interestingly they get IN sync, but that's not what I want
[08:02:00] <rabidus> .focus or .blur ?
[08:02:43] <kim366_> Thanks, I'll have to read up on those
[08:12:18] <kim366_> Sorry, my irc client crashed. So is `$(document).focus(() => { /* ... */ });` correct?
[08:12:53] <kim366_> Ok, most definitely not
[08:17:34] <kim366_> Also, the step function argument in https://api.jquery.com/fadeIn/ has now as an argument. Is that from 0 to 1? From 0 to duration?
[08:24:46] <kim366_> Nice, my website looks different in each browser, ffs
[08:25:51] <kim366_> In IE it's broken beyond repair, so I'll give up that one
[08:31:51] <kim366_> At least it works in both Opera & Chromium (I guess they are both webkit).
[08:34:52] <kim366_> Huh, in Edge .fadeIn/Out sets the opactiy css property to 1, 0 and then sets display to none. Very wierd and not what I want
[08:37:01] <kim366_> https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_fade.asp works in Edge,  though
[09:55:24] <plantain> Hi - I'm having trouble with $("someElement").before("<span>somespan</span>"), $("#someElement") properly matches the element but nothing is inserted before in the DOM and I can't figure out why. It's very deep in the DOM, in a scrolling list of <a>'s. Are there some limitations with this function?
[09:55:41] <plantain> unfortunately very hard for me to rip it out into a plunkr, part of a very large project :\
[10:00:25] <plantain> nevermind, figured it out...
[10:00:27] <plantain> multiple matches
[11:01:02] <jak2000> hi all
[11:13:50] <jak2000> anyone can see this url: https://www.codexworld.com/jquery-ui-datepicker-highlight-specific-dates/  <, with a servlet how to return this:   var eventDates = {};eventDates[ new Date( '08/07/2016' )] = new Date( '08/07/2016' );eventDates[ new Date( '08/12/2016' )] = new Date( '08/12/2016' ); eventDates[ new Date( '08/18/2016' )] = new Date( '08/18/2016' );eventDates[ new Date( '08/23/2016' )] =
[11:13:50] <jak2000> new Date( '08/23/2016' );  any advice?
[11:45:36] <skinux> Is it .ajax or .get to return JSON as a variable?
[11:46:35] <graingert> skinux: neither
[11:47:06] <graingert> let v = JSON.stringify(yourObj);
[11:47:13] <graingert> skinux: ^
[11:47:26] <skinux> NO, I mean as response from an API request
[11:47:27] <graingert> skinux: but it might be better off as a const
[11:47:47] <graingert> skinux: you can only get a promise back
[11:48:24] <graingert> skinux: also it won't generally return JSON. It usually parses it and returns a plain object
[11:48:35] <graingert> (in the promise)
[11:51:20] <graingert> I'm actually not sure if you're actually able to override that behaviour
[11:51:40] <graingert> skinux: is there any reason you want the JSON and not the parsed object?
[12:30:24] <skinux> I thought I had to get JSON and not a parsed object.
[12:30:53] <skinux> I thought I had to make a call to decode/encode
[13:17:57] <jak2000> anyone can see this url: https://www.codexworld.com/jquery-ui-datepicker-highlight-specific-dates/  <, with a servlet how to return this:   var eventDates = {};eventDates[ new Date( '08/07/2016' )] = new Date( '08/07/2016' );eventDates[ new Date( '08/12/2016' )] = new Date( '08/12/2016' ); eventDates[ new Date( '08/18/2016' )] = new Date( '08/18/2016' );eventDates[ new Date( '08/23/2016' )] =
[13:17:58] <jak2000> new Date( '08/23/2016' );  any advice?
[13:18:34] <Woet> jak2000: can you ask a question that makes sense?
[13:20:03] <jak2000> Woet
[13:23:55] <jak2000> wich programming language you use in backend? php? jsp?
[13:44:45] <Trashlord> perhaps you'll be better off showing us your code in a pastebin, and telling us what you intend to do
[13:47:24] <jak2018> Woet?
[13:47:47] <Woet> jak2018: sorry, I should have specified. can you ask a -> jQuery <- question that makes sense?
[13:49:21] <jak2018> ok i try....

[13:50:07] <jak2018> my question is how to build a dinamically dates... extracted from database?
[13:52:24] <Woet> jak2018: you turn it into JSON.
