[00:53:32] <comradequestions> can anyone help explain to me why maxWidth is still equal to -1 after running through this code? https://jsfiddle.net/nfy7xboL/ Note: when I just us a selector of $("menu-item") the code works as expected
[00:55:48] <comradequestions> I don't know if I am having trouble with javascript variables or what, but I figure if I set var menuItem = $("menu-item"); and replace the selector within the .load() function, it would have the same output as just running $("menu-item").each(...
[00:57:37] <comradequestions> anybody out there?
[01:10:56] <Cork> comradequestions: is menuItem defined inside $(function() {}) or directly in the js file?
[02:34:59] <hellyeah> hey can you help me to figure out why ajax call return error https://jsfiddle.net/Lf2q8wu0/7/
[02:41:04] <hellyeah> i fixed it
[02:42:27] <hellyeah> it seems buttonClick function is executed before ajax call you can see that by floowing alert boxes. What is the reason of that? https://jsfiddle.net/Lf2q8wu0/13/
[02:42:52] <Whiskey> I try to remove every whitespace before the spans start in the pretag here but it not working so good, http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/xzLxas2s/99/
[02:43:21] <hellyeah> do i need to wrap buttonClick with another ajax  call?
[02:43:47] <Whiskey> hellyeah: is it not alwasys you that help me :D
[02:45:17] <hellyeah> no unfortunately i am not
[02:45:19] <hellyeah> xD
[02:45:22] <Whiskey> :P
[02:45:44] <hellyeah> do you have smt to help me?
[02:45:59] <Whiskey> i never work whit json
[02:46:34] <hellyeah> ic
[02:46:45] <hellyeah> actually json part is not important
[02:46:47] <hellyeah> i covered
[02:46:57] <hellyeah> problem is buttonClick function is not fired
[02:47:17] <hellyeah> it seems js method is called before ajax request ends
[02:49:33] <hellyeah> buttonClick function is not working
[02:49:38] <hellyeah> i dont understand whyt
[03:11:42] <robhol> that guy..
[03:44:50] <hellyeah> hey i am sorry but may i ask what is wrong here https://jsfiddle.net/vv3b7dk3/4/
[03:52:38] <FilipNortic> hellyeah: is that suppose to be json?
[03:54:36] <hellyeah> it is not json it seems
[03:56:51] <FilipNortic> no quite far from
[03:57:12] <hellyeah> it is c# newtonsoft ibrary function
[03:57:17] <hellyeah> thats not really important
[03:57:22] <hellyeah> i have another question
[03:57:32] <FilipNortic> it's not even valid js
[03:57:44] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/Lf2q8wu0/18/ button alert comes before success is done why is it happening ?
[03:58:06] <hellyeah> FilipNortic: newtonsoft library suppose to generrate json thing for using in json object
[03:59:02] <FilipNortic> uou could put buttonClick() in the callback from the first request
[03:59:20] <FilipNortic> you could*
[03:59:37] <hellyeah> in the success
[03:59:40] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:59:43] <hellyeah> lemme try
[04:00:20] <FilipNortic> if you want the order to be ensured that's what you have to do
[04:00:22] <hellyeah> humm it worked
[04:00:28] <hellyeah> aha
[04:00:35] <hellyeah> good to learn about it
[04:00:51] <hellyeah> what if i use another ajax call in another js file
[04:01:00] <hellyeah> the order what i source it in html file
[04:01:20] <hellyeah> is enough to handle that ordering like which one is first which one is second
[04:01:25] <hellyeah> btw
[04:01:35] <hellyeah> js is async language by nature right
[04:01:40] <hellyeah> ajax is async call
[04:01:51] <hellyeah> so and interpret from top to buttom
[04:02:05] <hellyeah> so why i have to call buttonClick in ajax
[04:02:14] <FilipNortic> js is sync and one threaded but ajax call means they are async
[04:02:15] <hellyeah> am i thinking wrong? what is the deal here?
[04:02:26] <hellyeah> js is sync hmm
[04:02:36] <hellyeah> so the confusing here because of js is sync?
[04:02:53] <FilipNortic> js is sync expept for ajax calls that's what they are for
[04:03:00] <hellyeah> ic
[04:03:04] <hellyeah> so
[04:03:11] <hellyeah> but it is like
[04:03:13] <FilipNortic> to let other stuff execute while you're waiting for response
[04:03:13] <Cork> well there are more then ajax that are async
[04:03:29] <hellyeah> ajax happens then sync call buttonClick happens and lastly success function happens
[04:03:43] <hellyeah> it is kinda confusing
[04:03:50] <hellyeah> so callback function happens last?
[04:04:08] <Cork> hellyeah: do you know what a stack is in programming?
[04:04:24] <hellyeah> i know stack structure
[04:04:27] <hellyeah> yeah
[04:04:44] <hellyeah> is it first in last out
[04:04:48] <hellyeah> is that what you meant
[04:04:58] <Cork> ok, async callbacks can't ever be called until the entire javascript stack (your code) has unwinded
[04:05:04] <Cork> hellyeah: yes
[04:05:14] <Cork> each function you call push the old function into the stack
[04:05:28] <Cork> and then you get a list it walks back until you get back to the browsers code
[04:05:40] <Cork> when the browser gets control back it can call the async callbacks
[04:05:45] <Cork> they won't ever fire before that
[04:05:56] <hellyeah> ic
[04:06:15] <hellyeah> so you mean
[04:06:42] <hellyeah> all things called then lastly succes function happens because browser needs to control of all of it?
[04:06:53] <hellyeah> sorry i am newbie in those js concept
[04:07:03] <Cork> hellyeah: mostly correct
[04:07:23] <Cork> hellyeah: it isn't cause the browser has to, but cause the spec dictates that (since old)
[04:07:49] <hellyeah> w3 spec?
[04:08:04] <hellyeah> i got it now
[04:08:06] <Cork> EcmaScript spec
[04:08:15] <hellyeah> oh ic
[04:08:20] <hellyeah> ecmascript
[04:08:35] <hellyeah> anyway i understand what the problem is thanks
[04:08:44] <hellyeah> what about i have two ajax calls
[04:08:56] <hellyeah> js will know which one is first which one is second
[04:09:01] <Cork> hellyeah: same rule apply
[04:09:08] <hellyeah> i have two files have two different ajax cal
[04:09:12] <hellyeah> file a and b
[04:09:13] <Cork> hellyeah: you won't have a guaranteed order
[04:09:19] <hellyeah> ic
[04:09:30] <Cork> it depends on when the browser gets the content from the system
[04:09:40] <Cork> so it depends on server delay, network delay and so on
[04:10:10] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:10:12] <Cork> hellyeah: $.when is created to help deal with that
[04:10:16] <hellyeah> ic why it is not guaranteed
[04:10:34] <Cork> you can give it a list of ajax calls and then .done will be called when all of them are done
[04:10:41] <Cork> and give you a list of responses
[04:11:02] <hellyeah> so when then
[04:11:15] <hellyeah> humm
[04:11:24] <hellyeah> so finish first then do second, then third
[04:11:32] <hellyeah> it is like giving order of execution
[04:11:35] <hellyeah> is that right?
[04:12:11] <hellyeah> let me take a look at that
[04:12:25] <Cork> hellyeah: there are two options
[04:12:43] <Cork> hellyeah: either mark the content when it comes in and inject it where it should be in the order
[04:12:53] <Cork> or you can make one request at a time (slow)
[04:13:13] <hellyeah> what about second option?
[04:13:16] <Cork> or a mix of the two where you request all of them and then show them all at once
[04:13:26] <Cork> <Cork> or you can make one request at a time (slow) <--
[04:13:32] <Cork> that is the second option
[04:13:32] <hellyeah> ic
[04:14:00] <Cork> anyway the third option is the simplest
[04:14:00] <hellyeah> okey
[04:14:08] <Cork> and it gives you an ok speed
[04:14:13] <hellyeah> i guess i will prefer mixing all of them
[04:14:21] <Cork> the first is by far the fastest, but also the most complex
[04:14:25] <hellyeah> ok speed? what does it mean?
[04:14:37] <hellyeah> my english is kinda bad
[04:14:50] <hellyeah> okey i will do second one
[04:14:50] <Cork> hellyeah: making one call at a time means you don't start the next call until you have the response from the first
[04:15:03] <Cork> that means things take a lot longer
[04:15:11] <Cork> (order of magnitude)
[04:15:24] <hellyeah> is this similar to what you sid "in mixing all of them"
[04:15:36] <Cork> not really
[04:15:41] <Cork> it has a balance
[04:15:41] <hellyeah> ah okey
[04:15:47] <Cork> the third option will take as long as the longest request
[04:15:52] <hellyeah> it has a balance?
[04:16:01] <Cork> you won't get any content until all of them has gotten the response
[04:16:17] <hellyeah> yeah that seems sensible right?
[04:16:28] <hellyeah> cuz second function relay on first one
[04:16:42] <Cork> no
[04:16:55] <hellyeah> like i have to create button give json str to button and give buttonClass?
[04:17:00] <hellyeah> hmm no why is that?
[04:17:03] <Cork> the second one and first one is completely different solutions
[04:17:30] <Cork> the second solution basically starts the next ajax call from the success call of the previous ajax call
[04:17:32] <hellyeah> yeah method is different
[04:17:37] <hellyeah> but their environment is same
[04:17:47] <Cork> the first solution makes them all at once and then puts them into the page as the content comes back
[04:17:56] <Cork> the third one uses $.when().done()
[04:18:07] <Cork> the third is quite close to the first one
[04:18:29] <Cork> hellyeah: no, not really
[04:18:38] <hellyeah> so what should i do exactly if you dont mind can you give me example with my code
[04:18:44] <hellyeah> ?
[04:19:01] <Cork> like i just said, first option if you need the speed
[04:19:13] <Cork> third one if you want to avoid the complexity that entails
[04:19:20] <Cork> i don't recommend the second one at all
[04:19:38] <hellyeah> i need speed
[04:19:51] <hellyeah> doesnt matter how complex it is
[04:19:57] <hellyeah> prefer to learn it and use it
[04:19:59] <Cork> hellyeah: do you need to get "any content" as soon as possible
[04:20:07] <Cork> or just "fast"?
[04:20:23] <hellyeah> i need content yes
[04:20:28] <Cork> ,,,
[04:20:31] <Cork> read that question again
[04:20:59] <hellyeah> i need to get any content as fast as posible
[04:21:13] <Cork> ok then you will have to go the more complex route
[04:21:22] <hellyeah> yes okey
[04:21:37] <hellyeah> any link you can suggest, any tutorial?
[04:21:44] <Cork> and the simplest solution for that is to mark each response with an id
[04:22:08] <Cork> and then just inject the code inbetween the other ids at the place it should be
[04:22:17] <Cork> and no i don't have any tutorials for this
[04:22:24] <hellyeah> ah okey
[04:22:33] <hellyeah> can you give me small examples with my code
[04:22:37] <hellyeah> so i can work on this
[04:22:40] <hellyeah> if you dont mind
[04:22:53] <Cork> and by id i mean something like <div id="wrapper-position-id-10">
[04:23:16] <Cork> hellyeah: i've given you how to do it, try to get it going
[04:23:40] <hellyeah> Cork:
[04:23:43] <hellyeah> you mean like
[04:23:52] <hellyeah> putting result into div with id
[04:23:54] <hellyeah> ?
[04:24:00] <Cork> yes
[04:24:06] <hellyeah> ah okey
[04:24:09] <hellyeah> ic
[04:24:12] <hellyeah> i will try it
[04:24:36] <Cork> hellyeah: another option is to add the div when you start the ajax calls
[04:24:55] <Cork> and then you can do something like $('#wrapper-position-id-10').replaceWith(data)
[04:24:58] <hellyeah> so like keeping ajax call in the div?
[04:25:04] <Cork> no
[04:25:12] <Cork> that is for the html not the ajax call
[04:25:58] <hellyeah> okey
[04:26:05] <hellyeah> which one you suggest?
[04:26:22] <Cork> it is just a matter of opinion
[04:26:23] <hellyeah> first one sounds more doable to me
[04:26:33] <hellyeah> Cork: you are way expert then me
[04:26:35] <Cork> both are about the same level of complexity
[04:26:42] <hellyeah> so your suggestion will guide me
[04:26:51] <hellyeah> okey i guess i understood first one better
[04:26:59] <Cork> the difference is that the second solution removes the div when it adds the content
[04:27:01] <hellyeah> let me see what i can do
[04:27:04] <Cork> while the first keeps them
[04:27:11] <hellyeah> humm
[04:27:46] <hellyeah> Cork: if i do first suggestion will i see any content in html source?
[04:28:07] <hellyeah> i am using ajax call for not seeing anything in html source
[04:28:08] <Cork> uh, depends on what you mean by source
[04:28:12] <hellyeah> thats one of the reason
[04:28:19] <hellyeah> Cork: view page source
[04:28:19] <Cork> if you mean the browsers dom inspector, then yes
[04:28:28] <hellyeah> no not dom
[04:28:33] <Cork> if you mean the source view of the original html call then no
[04:28:41] <hellyeah> when you do view page source you will get html code right
[04:28:45] <hellyeah> ah okey
[04:28:47] <Cork> it is what was in the original html not what ajax fetches
[04:28:52] <hellyeah> first one is good to go then
[04:29:04] <Cork> hellyeah: both works that way
[04:29:10] <hellyeah> okey ic
[04:29:17] <hellyeah> now i have to eat some food
[04:29:22] <Cork> hellyeah: though note, ppl can still get to the content
[04:29:27] <Cork> ajax doesn't prevent that
[04:29:44] <hellyeah> okey
[04:29:53] <hellyeah> the onbly thing i prevent with ajax
[04:30:01] <hellyeah> people cannot copy and paste html code
[04:30:06] <hellyeah> i have sensitive information
[04:30:18] <hellyeah> when click button you will see those information
[04:30:33] <hellyeah> and i dont want to copy and paste tabular data from html source
[04:30:49] <hellyeah> i dont want anything to copy and paste tabular data too
[04:30:53] <hellyeah> i will be back
[04:42:47] <robhol> wtf
[05:05:19] <vev_> we are voluntary on #libreidea and we re looking for a dev to help in this project >> http://www.libreidea.org/Collaborative_keywords_mixing_project
[05:15:15] <vev_> project is innovative and it uses collaboration intelligence
[05:25:09] <FilipNortic> vev_: your site kind of hints that you want a core (Haskell, PHP, Python).
[05:25:32] <vev_> dev asks for this
[05:26:13] <vev_> i know nothing, what programming language can be use for for you?
[05:27:10] <vev_> FilipNortic
[06:03:45] <hellyeah> Cork: still there
[06:04:10] <DreamStiffler> hi guys, im trying to use one function which will work on all my dynamically generated <tr>. Please view here: https://jsfiddle.net/jtsLu3gf/3/ . How do i do that?
[06:04:14] <hellyeah> this is not working as i expected but is that what you meant am i in correct route? https://jsfiddle.net/Lf2q8wu0/23/
[06:09:53] <Cork> DreamStiffler: your really using 1.8? that is quite old
[06:11:22] <DreamStiffler> Cork: ok use the latest if you will
[06:11:33] <Cork> DreamStiffler: it matters quite a bit
[06:11:42] <DreamStiffler> Cork: 1.11.3 is fine
[06:11:48] <Cork> 1.9 uses .on while 1.8 uses .delegate
[06:11:56] <DreamStiffler> Cork: i see
[06:12:02] <DreamStiffler> Cork: wink
[06:13:01] <Cork> DreamStiffler: https://jsfiddle.net/jtsLu3gf/4/
[06:13:23] <xec> .on was introduced in 1.7
[06:13:38] <Cork> it was??
[06:13:46] <Cork> (i honestly don't remember any more)
[06:14:08] <xec> at least that's what the docs say http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[06:14:12] <Cork> so it was
[06:14:25] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/on/ is a better source
[06:14:42] <xec> yeah but the first paragraph says "As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method."
[06:14:55] <Cork> ya, but that doesn't really mean much
[06:14:57] <DreamStiffler> closest. well ok thats new to me.
[06:15:24] <Cork> DreamStiffler: you don't really need to use it if you don't want to https://jsfiddle.net/jtsLu3gf/5/
[06:15:33] <Cork> the problem is that you used ids
[06:16:19] <DreamStiffler> Do you guys have every api in your head?
[06:16:42] <Cork> well i have what commands exist (mostly)
[06:16:48] <Cork> the syntax is another matter though
[06:17:29] <thatIntern> Is it possible with jquery mobile to load one set of html pages, if the device is in portrait mode, and use another set of html pages if it's in landscape? I know you can do the styling depending on the orientation, but I need a completely different layout.
[06:18:15] <DreamStiffler> thanks Cork  that was awesome
[06:31:26] <C0nundrum> anyone here ?
[06:53:18] <hellyeah> Cork: do you mean something like that https://jsfiddle.net/Lf2q8wu0/23/ ?
[06:54:09] <Cork> hellyeah: you mean 33 should have access to what line 29 grabs?
[06:55:14] <hellyeah> i added buttons in line 57 and append buttons to a div and try to call it with load method in line 29
[06:55:34] <hellyeah> when you load part1 i need to see buttons loaded?
[06:56:34] <Cork> hellyeah: i don't follow what your trying to do
[06:56:53] <Cork> hellyeah: line 29 is a .load call it can't be called from anything
[06:57:34] <hellyeah> i just try to load div part1
[06:57:46] <hellyeah> i added buttons to part1 in line 57
[06:57:55] <Cork> uh, what?
[06:57:58] <hellyeah> why it cannot be called?
[06:58:13] <hellyeah> hmm guess i did something doesnt make sense
[06:58:15] <hellyeah> i got it
[06:58:29] <Cork> $().load will make an ajax call grab the html returned and add it to the element matches by the $() selector
[06:58:31] <Cork> that's it
[06:58:33] <hellyeah> i just try to underststand what you describe me in early today
[06:58:42] <hellyeah> humm
[06:58:51] <hellyeah> aha
[06:58:53] <hellyeah> ic
[06:59:08] <hellyeah> i suppose load method will load the matched element to the dom
[06:59:44] <hellyeah> i read it wrongly
[06:59:46] <Cork> hellyeah: read the documentation
[07:08:25] <linuxmint> Hello, I'm trying to add jquery to cordova. npm says to run $ npm install cordova-jquery. That worked, but then $ cordova-jquery says Command not found.
[07:09:28] <hellyeah> cant you give me simple code about what you meant Cork
[07:10:17] <FilipNortic> hellyeah: is there something wrong with the examples at jQuery.load api page?
[07:10:45] <hellyeah> no i just understood wrong
[07:11:04] <hellyeah> i must load div with load method
[07:11:20] <hellyeah> i try to call div with load instead of calling method from success
[07:11:24] <hellyeah> does it make sense?
[07:11:49] <hellyeah> it worked
[07:13:25] <hellyeah> FilipNortic: i just try to load result of stringcollection into div part1 what did i do wrong here can you take a look https://jsfiddle.net/Lf2q8wu0/38/
[07:18:07] <FilipNortic> hellyeah: console complains about a syntax error you've got to chase it down your self
[07:19:16] <hellyeah> actually it is mad about calling stringCollection()
[07:19:22] <hellyeah> when i do function()
[07:19:26] <hellyeah> it didnt complain
[07:19:45] <hellyeah> so in the ajax call i can call it like stringColection() i dont understand the error
[07:20:45] <hellyeah> anyway i will check later
[07:20:57] <hellyeah> does it make sense to call ajax call from another ajax call
[07:21:20] <taplar> it can
[07:21:25] <taplar> depending on the situation
[07:21:51] <timwis> Hey guys, is there a way to calculate the difference in widths between two elements without adding them to the DOM (based on their class styles)?
[07:22:31] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:22:35] <hellyeah> let me fiddle it
[07:23:27] <taplar> timwis: not sure.  that would seem to be odd though as parent nodes can influence the childs width/height so it could be inaccurate
[07:23:43] <timwis> true
[07:23:58] <timwis> trying to get the diff between col-sm-1 and col-sm-2 (bootstrap columns)
[07:29:34] <dudeJi_> Hey guys i am developing formbuilder library . So when ever i drop an element's -icon , i want to convert it into a view form of html as editable and then after it finishes editing i want even to be completed . So what are events there , i am confused between create and drop and stop
[07:29:42] <hellyeah> taplar: i just try to make buttons and give something to the button in string collection. In second ajax call when you click the button i will pass the parameter to the method in the backend. Situtation seems logical ? using ajax call inside another ajax call https://jsfiddle.net/Lf2q8wu0/42/
[07:31:52] <hellyeah> my question is understandable?
[07:32:07] <taplar> still looking. btw, don't do attr('data-*', value)
[07:32:10] <taplar> use data()
[07:33:04] <taplar> #2
[07:33:15] <taplar> why are you building the collection string for every button?
[07:33:55] <taplar> oh, nvm
[07:34:06] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:34:40] <hellyeah> does it make sense?
[07:34:50] <taplar> still reading, heh
[07:34:55] <taplar> you don't need line 40
[07:35:42] <taplar> other than the attr() use instead of data() looks fineish
[07:35:58] <hellyeah> return collection
[07:36:03] <hellyeah> i dont need that hmm
[07:36:09] <taplar> not in the if, your doing it outside
[07:36:18] <taplar> it'll happen on the second one without the first
[07:36:24] <hellyeah> i suppose i use return to assign returnvalue of function to the variable
[07:36:42] <hellyeah> i remove line 40
[07:39:48] <hellyeah> taplar: i checked the line 51 it seems it didnt work and look at documentation it seems clear to me what am i doing wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/Lf2q8wu0/47/
[07:40:40] <taplar> why do you think it did not work?
[07:40:55] <hellyeah> humm
[07:41:06] <hellyeah> i checked inspector
[07:41:12] <hellyeah> there is no data attribute there
[07:41:44] <taplar> your trying to read it with attr
[07:41:53] <taplar> alert($(this).data('jsonparameter'));
[07:42:58] <hellyeah> yeah it is there
[07:43:04] <taplar> yep
[07:43:07] <hellyeah> but why i didnt see that in dom
[07:43:19] <taplar> how are you looking at the dom?
[07:43:24] <hellyeah> well
[07:43:34] <taplar> if your inspecting the page and looking at the html it will not be there
[07:43:35] <hellyeah> clicking right button of mouse over the button
[07:43:43] <hellyeah> and inspect element
[07:43:44] <hellyeah> <button class="buttonClass">Prod: Ecourse</button>
[07:43:47] <taplar> the html is not the dom
[07:43:56] <hellyeah> hmm okey
[07:44:25] <hellyeah> i suppose element shows dom
[07:44:59] <taplar> data() will go to the element or the dom, depending on some things
[07:45:09] <hellyeah> like?
[07:45:14] <taplar> attr() always goes to the html i believe
[07:45:17] <hellyeah> well why everything is vague xD
[07:45:23] <hellyeah> xP
[07:45:29] <hellyeah> x)
[07:45:35] <taplar> well i mean think about it
[07:45:58] <taplar> if you have an element that has an attribute on its html, you should be able to look it up with data()
[07:46:07] <taplar> if it's a data-* attribute that is
[07:46:19] <taplar> but also if you dynamically add one, it should find it even though it's not on the html
[07:47:47] <hellyeah> well cuz it is dynamically added right
[07:48:00] <hellyeah> okey ic
[07:48:20] <hellyeah> data() will go to the element or the dom, depending on some things
[07:48:25] <taplar> yep
[07:48:29] <hellyeah> just wonder how to decide this thing
[07:48:37] <taplar> most likely it has them cached or something
[07:48:41] <hellyeah> it seems like it is depending on something
[07:48:44] <taplar> and if it's not in the cache it looks at the html
[07:48:45] <hellyeah> ic
[07:49:22] <hellyeah> i have a question you may know btw
[07:49:29] <hellyeah> i am loading some buttons here
[07:49:43] <hellyeah> and this buttons will have some css
[07:49:57] <hellyeah> is there a way to cache css setting on ajax call?
[07:50:06] <hellyeah> or will it be loaded each time?
[07:50:19] <taplar> what do you mean cache it?
[07:50:31] <hellyeah> ihmm
[07:50:49] <hellyeah> like remembering the margin of button, font size etc.
[07:51:05] <hellyeah> or will it check rules in css file everytime?
[07:51:08] <taplar> define your css to operate off of a parent element
[07:52:04] <hellyeah> with jquery?
[07:52:25] <taplar> no, in your css stylesheet
[07:53:26] <hellyeah> hmm i will check
[07:54:26] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/Lf2q8wu0/50/
[07:57:27] <hellyeah> actuallt dunno what operate off means :XD
[07:58:14] <taplar> you can do it directly like i did in that link
[07:58:23] <taplar> or you can do it off of a parent
[07:58:46] <taplar> for instance if a class 'container' had (future) children with class 'record'
[07:59:05] <taplar> then you could make a css rule to affect records in the container with: .container .record { /* whatever */ }
[07:59:50] <hellyeah> ic
[07:59:55] <taplar> the selectors that you use to find elements with jquery typically can be used in css stylesheets as well
[08:00:44] <taplar> by that i mean the selector patterns, not the actual selector method
[08:01:21] <hellyeah> ic
[08:01:38] <hellyeah> .record {} .container{} in first load
[08:01:56] <hellyeah> after that is it always .record.container{..}
[08:01:58] <taplar> ^ that would be two rules not a nested one
[08:02:00] <taplar> brb
[08:02:08] <hellyeah> i guess it means immediate child of container
[08:02:14] <hellyeah> humm
[08:02:31] <hellyeah> .container .record{.. }
[08:02:32] <hellyeah> thanks
[08:02:56] <taplar> bak
[08:03:11] <taplar> .element <- single rule, global
[08:03:24] <taplar> .element1 .element2 < nested elements
[08:03:41] <taplar> .element1.element2 <- single rule, global, must have both classes
[08:04:05] <taplar> .element1 < .element2 <- DIRECTLY nested elements
[08:04:18] <Cork> wrong direction :)
[08:04:21] <taplar> crap
[08:04:31] <taplar> i typed it like 3 times too
[08:04:42] <taplar> .element1 > .element2 <- DIRECTLY nested elements
[08:05:58] <taplar> you can google css selectors and find all kinds of stuff
[08:06:18] <hellyeah> lemme read
[08:06:44] <hellyeah> taplar:
[08:06:50] <hellyeah> your < confused me :D:D:D
[08:06:58] <hellyeah> okey taplar i will check thanks
[08:06:59] <hellyeah> brb
[08:07:44] <taplar> sorry
[08:08:42] <taplar> i typically stick to those selectors and try not to get too fancy.  i know some people don't like the use of '>'
[08:17:29] <enerel> anyone please recommend me decent free google translate plugin? i need only certain text to be translated
[08:40:48] <hellyeah> yo
[08:41:03] <hellyeah> is it good choice to  do ajax call within another ajax call
[08:41:17] <taplar> you already asked that, :P
[08:41:21] <hellyeah> do i have have another choice here you meantioned earlier today Cork https://jsfiddle.net/Lf2q8wu0/51/
[08:41:34] <hellyeah> taplar: Cork talked about something earlier today
[08:41:42] <hellyeah> like using id
[08:41:57] <hellyeah> i am not fully covered in my mind.
[08:42:12] <hellyeah> he meantioned there is some choices about excution order
[08:42:16] <taplar> and technically your not doing an ajax from an ajax
[08:42:30] <taplar> your second ajax is executed on button click
[08:42:33] <hellyeah> i guess i am calling function from ahax
[08:42:36] <hellyeah> ajax
[08:42:52] <hellyeah> humm so but i will have many functions too
[08:43:02] <hellyeah> so i will call everything in success function
[08:43:17] <hellyeah> because he said browser needs to load all stuff before executing callback function
[08:43:20] <hellyeah> am i right?
[08:43:30] <taplar> uh
[08:43:48] <taplar> your ajax call may depend on the dom being loaded if your referencing data there
[08:43:56] <taplar> or manipulating data there
[08:44:00] <hellyeah> it is on the log i dont have log of today :XD
[08:44:29] <hellyeah> right
[08:44:43] <hellyeah> morning i try to call function outside and do ajax call
[08:44:48] <hellyeah> order is not guaranteed
[08:45:11] <hellyeah> it did ajax call then call the function. Lastly execute success callback
[08:45:26] <hellyeah> may be it is not important detail
[08:45:47] <hellyeah> may be not understandable right now
[08:46:31] <taplar> any logic that should happen after an ajax call finishes would need to be in, or executed from, one of the helper closures (success, fail, etc.. )
[08:47:52] <hellyeah> so if i have 50 methods
[08:47:59] <hellyeah> i should call them as a sequence
[08:48:03] <hellyeah> okey ic
[08:50:12] <taplar> if you wanted you could break it out into its own function to maybe increase readability and break it up some
[08:54:51] <hellyeah> ic
[08:55:09] <dudeJi_> what is use of stop and start in jquery draggale ?
[08:55:49] <taplar> http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#event-stop
[09:11:07] <enerel> recommend me decent free google translate plugin? i need only certain text to be translated
[09:13:18] <MikeD_> what does 'only certain text' translate mean?
[09:14:46] <MikeD_> >> 1
[09:24:34] <arc_> he needs to be able to specify what text will be translated rather than translating the whole page
[09:24:39] <arc_> is what i'm guessing it means
[09:26:55] <MikeD_> oh - i was imagining i18n stuff like you could do:  var phrases = { "hi" : { "en" : "hello", "sp": "hola" /* etc */ } }  then use phrases("hi", language) or somesuch convenience functions
[09:40:53] <enerel> hello
[09:40:57] <enerel> guys help please

[09:51:19] <RabSimpson> hi folks. would an element's display being set to none result in the outerHeight and outerWidth of it's child element's being set to zero?
[10:26:42] <MikeD_> is there an easy way to enforce only numbers in an input but also allow navigation keys like delete, tab, left/right, etc. ?
[10:28:29] <taplar> so disallow alpha?
[10:28:43] <MikeD_> alpha and all the punctuation
[10:30:11] <MikeD_> (/A-Za-z/).test( String.fromCharCode( event.which ) )  is a start... but i don't want to list every invalid character
[10:30:53] <derekZero_> How do I markup my html nav and sections to be compatible with this smoothscrolling technique? https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/
[10:30:53] <MikeD_> i also don't really know the list of allowed characters for the all the things that are not 0-9
[10:32:45] <taplar> MikeD_: i believe your going to have to do one or the other.  just depends which is smaller to list, your white list or your black list.  also if you bind on 'input' you would only have to worry about the events that actually change the value, not the navigational ones
[10:33:43] <taplar> validatejs might have something prebuilt for that though
[10:39:28] <SuperTyp> is there a way to find out where in my script a resource is loaded? I have an missing image and I don't know where the image get's called
[10:40:08] <derekZero_> SuperTyp Ctl + F ?
[10:40:18] <derekZero_> Ctrl*
[10:40:51] <SuperTyp> derekZero_, if it would be that easy :) I am working with a cms and there are like +10 scripts
[10:41:13] <SuperTyp> I mean a tool like firebug?
[10:41:16] <hlvwrk> o.o
[10:41:21] <derekZero_> If the page is live try Inspect Element?
[10:41:37] <derekZero_> Oh, but the image isn't on the live site?
[10:42:31] <derekZero_> Download the files locally, and use command-line?
[10:43:57] <derekZero_> Heck, you don't even have to use command-line SuperTyp . After downloading the files you could use Explorer or Finder to search through the contents of the files. But command-line is cool.
[10:45:35] <SuperTyp> derekZero_ there is an image missing of a slideshow (some shadow thing), thus the slideshow is broken, I want to know where in my scripts the image file is requested.
[10:46:14] <derekZero_> Oh, so you're saying you wouldn't know what the image file request looks like either?
[10:46:19] <SuperTyp> in fireburg e.g. I can see the GET request but nothing more
[10:46:38] <derekZero_> Do you know the name of the image?
[10:46:41] <SuperTyp> yes
[10:47:01] <derekZero_> Does the script not use the image name to call it?
[10:48:21] <SuperTyp> nope
[10:48:28] <SuperTyp> I have searched the whole live site
[10:49:08] <SuperTyp> and the only thing I find is this:  <div class="image-shadow"><img src="/vfr/sites/all/themes/ukulele/images/sidebar-image-shadow.png" /></div>
[11:09:31] <MikeD_> can someone please explain how this is expected behavior?  it's not expected to me, which is why I'm asking:  http://jsfiddle.net/py0f7wkm/3/
[11:12:36] <django_> anyone use egghead.io?
[11:14:52] <SuperTyp> MikeD_, 8
[11:17:11] <derekZero_> MikeD Why bother putting /n in '' when it's by itself?
[11:19:11] <SuperTyp> MikeD_, what behavious is unexpected to you?
[11:19:17] <SuperTyp> behaviour*
[11:19:30] <SuperTyp> behavior**
[11:19:32] <SuperTyp> ffs
[11:20:03] <SuperTyp> ah I see
[11:22:54] <SuperTyp> MikeD_, "charCode is never set in the keydown and keyup events. In these cases, keyCode is set instead."

[11:44:04] <MikeD_> thanks
[12:15:37] <sigdk> I'm looking for a nice book/tutorial to get me started with jQuery
[12:15:54] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/ is a good place to start.
[12:19:35] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, is jquery + html + css enough to build a nice/functional web interface ?
[12:20:12] <robertmaxrees> *javascript - jquery is just a library.
[12:20:22] <sigdk> O
[12:20:43] <sigdk> I've a database and I need to present some data to the user... do I need also a java servlet ?
[12:20:45] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, those are basically the three technologies you get.  none of that teaches you about design though.
[12:21:11] <robertmaxrees> and doesn't handle any of your server-side concerns sooo.
[12:24:13] <robertmaxrees> or some other server-side technology, yes.
[12:24:17] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, I didn't get it... can I talk with jQuery to the database directly (Is it the way things are done) ?
[12:24:23] <sigdk> ah... ok
[12:24:23] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:24:47] <robertmaxrees> and javascript, not jquery - jquery is just a library.
[12:25:05] <robertmaxrees> but you'll need a server-side language.  java, node, php, etc.
[12:25:26] <hlvwrk> o.o
[12:25:31] * hlvwrk licks robertmaxrees 
[12:25:35] <robertmaxrees> wat
[12:25:39] <hlvwrk> wot
[12:25:42] <taplar> awkward...
[12:25:52] <hlvwrk> for who?
[12:25:59] <robertmaxrees> everybody
[12:26:20] <royalty> i mean people get licked
[12:26:21] <royalty> it happens
[12:26:29] <robertmaxrees> welp
[12:26:36] <taplar> lmao
[12:26:57] <taplar> nice to know i'm excluded from 'people'
[12:27:48] <hlvwrk> lol
[12:27:54] * hlvwrk licks taplar a lot
[12:28:14] <taplar> do you take visa?
[12:32:44] <mcfdez87> Hello. I have this small script. How can I prent to dropdown up the subitem If I click on the subItem? Now dropdowns up if i click in it. https://jsfiddle.net/8027a94n/4/
[12:33:14] <robertmaxrees> "prebt to dropdown"?
[12:33:40] <robertmaxrees> err, prent?
[12:34:24] <robertmaxrees> you mean you don't want child elements to trigger the click for parent elements?
[12:34:24] <decx> read up on event bubbling
[12:34:53] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/ check this out.
[12:34:58] <robertmaxrees> and event bubbling.
[12:35:10] <mcfdez87> robertmaxrees, when I click to parent li it dropdowns the subitem
[12:35:20] <mcfdez87> but If i click to subitem it hides again
[12:35:24] <mcfdez87> I want to prevent this
[12:35:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah, read up on event bubbling and the event object.
[12:35:35] <mcfdez87> onky hide if I click on parent li again
[12:36:06] <django_> http://jsfiddle.net/zs2xjb8g/1/
[12:36:47] <decx> read up on selectors and the difference between native properties and jquery ones
[12:36:56] <robertmaxrees> django_ couple issues there - $('a b c') is trying to select tags "a", "b", and "c", not those calsses.
[12:36:58] <robertmaxrees> *classes
[12:37:28] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, innerText is a native DOM property.  not available on jquery objects.
[12:37:37] <django_> http://jsfiddle.net/zs2xjb8g/2/
[12:37:40] <django_> :o
[12:37:49] <robertmaxrees> innerText isn't available on jquery objects.
[12:37:50] <django_> howcan i get innerText in jquery>
[12:38:02] <decx> use prop() to access properties
[12:38:09] <robertmaxrees> https://www.google.com/search?q=jquery+get+text
[12:38:17] <robertmaxrees> should literally be the first result there.
[12:38:31] <django_> also i can do: console.log($('.a .b span.c'));
[12:38:46] <robertmaxrees> sure, but don't prepend tagnames on classes.
[12:38:52] <django_> after checking if its class a and b then check if its  a span with .c
[12:38:54] <decx> then you'll see all the methods and properties attached to this object
[12:39:02] <mcfdez87> robertmaxrees, I readed it, but not know what event I need to call
[12:39:25] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/event.target/
[12:39:40] <robertmaxrees> mcfdez87 read the first paragraph on that page.
[12:53:30] <django_> document.querySelector('.myClass'), there is a span and a div
[12:53:33] <django_> i wanna get the div
[12:53:38] <robertmaxrees> div.myClass
[12:53:43] <robertmaxrees> but thta's a bad convention,.
[12:53:50] <robertmaxrees> fix your classes to be more semantic.
[12:53:52] <django_> ok
[13:14:10] <StephenS> I'm trying to get file's size in jQuery, but this var file = $('#mainfile').files[0]; file.size;  Cannot read property '0' of undefined
[13:14:13] <StephenS> any ideas?
[13:14:35] <robertmaxrees> $('#mainfile').files is returning "undefined"
[13:14:43] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle or something.
[13:14:46] <StephenS> this is what I have in DOM <input type="file" id="mainfile" name="file">
[13:14:52] <StephenS> really weird
[13:15:03] <robertmaxrees> when are you reading from that input?
[13:15:06] <StephenS> however form is wrapped with another ID, but that shouldnt be an issue
[13:15:13] <StephenS> on change
[13:15:38] <StephenS> $('#mainform').change(function (e) { //read file size here }
[13:15:46] <robertmaxrees> oh, each
[13:15:49] <robertmaxrees> err, easy
[13:15:56] <robertmaxrees> $('#mainfile').files will never work.
[13:16:03] <robertmaxrees> native dom methods aren't available on jquery objects.
[13:16:19] <robertmaxrees> need to .prop('files') or this.files
[13:16:23] <StephenS> .files(0) worked for me, when I changed listener
[13:16:28] <StephenS> but yeah I used this.
[13:16:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:17:31] <StephenS> are you suggesting me something like $("#mainfile).prop('files').size?
[13:17:54] <robertmaxrees> you could do that, or just use this.files
[13:18:10] <robertmaxrees> instead of passing everything through the jquery constructor for no reason
[13:18:30] <StephenS> ok prop worked ;)
[13:18:45] <robertmaxrees> no reason to use $() in this case fwiw.
[13:19:01] <StephenS> I cannot use this atm since I have some other listener on a mainform element
[13:19:07] <StephenS> but nvm, overall it works.
[13:19:19] <robertmaxrees> or the event object, or whatever.
[13:19:21] <robertmaxrees> anyway.
[13:19:30] <royalty> *lick*
[13:19:35] <royalty> sorry
[13:19:37] <royalty> out of line
[13:19:45] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[13:19:51] <robertmaxrees> second person to do that today.
[13:20:11] <decx> it's deerseason and the channel is salty
[13:20:19] <robertmaxrees> decx++
[13:20:44] <royalty> yeah it just kind of happened i didn't even mean to type it
[13:20:51] <royalty> my hands were out of my control
[13:21:11] <taplar> no lie, officer...
[13:40:04] <huck5> I'm trying to dynamically add the onclick method for an input field, so that it opens a datepicker. I'm getting "datpicker not valid function". Looking at this code snippet, do you think this is due to the way I am adding the onclick function? Or is it likely duplicate/incorrect jquery script imports? https://gist.github.com/Huck5/d417c16a92358f3495f7
[13:40:32] <robertmaxrees> don't use onclick
[13:40:50] <huck5> robertmaxrees, alternate suggestion :)?
[13:40:52] <robertmaxrees> you have jquery - use .on() instead.
[13:41:17] <huck5> ah ok. And set that dynamically on the input element created? Just do something like input.on = .... ?
[13:41:24] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:41:34] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation.
[13:41:49] <robertmaxrees> so you're not individually re-binding.
[13:41:56] <robertmaxrees> have your binding elsewhere.
[13:47:04] <cryptomonk> greetings
[13:47:15] <cryptomonk> does anyone know if SweetAlert triggers a mouse out or change :hover state?
[13:47:28] <cryptomonk> I'm using it when either hover or .mouseenter
[13:48:03] <cryptomonk> load on enter, close on out so I'm getting this flashing effect where it's trigging in/ou all the time even though the mouse is not moving

[14:13:32] <mdev> how can I access MAINDIR
[14:13:42] <mdev> obj.MAINDIR doesn't work
[14:14:00] <robertmaxrees> console.log(typeof obj);

[14:15:23] <robertmaxrees> welp
[14:15:36] <robertmaxrees> should work just fine.
[14:18:14] <mdev> thanks
[14:18:27] <mdev> got it working
[14:18:32] <robertmaxrees> what was the issue?
[14:18:40] <mdev> is node.js, I assigned the variable to another and that somehow fixed...idk why
[14:18:52] <mdev> var obj = req.body;
[14:18:52] <mdev> console.log(obj.PHPBIN);
[14:19:00] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're probably stomping on it at some point.
[14:19:08] <robertmaxrees> obj is a really bad variable name fwiw.
[14:19:14] <mdev> i'll change it
[14:19:23] <mdev> just glad it works, wasted so much time on that :(
[14:19:29] <robertmaxrees> hah
[14:19:35] <robertmaxrees> it's always the little issues that trip us up.
[14:20:11] <mdev> yeah but I have a very upset client, so need to get things done! thanks for always being helpful in here, channels fortunate to have you, gonna get back to it, take care
[14:55:32] <derekZero_> Can anyone help me fix these landing elements so they appear on scroll? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vNagXw
[14:57:35] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[14:58:03] <royalty> derekZero_, even with is-showing i can't see anything
[14:58:19] <royalty> derekZero_, might want to at least get the css/html working before you add the js to it
[14:58:19] <robertmaxrees> what is this actually trying to do?
[14:58:24] <PapaSierra> every search for "ajax caching" throws up "how to *prevent* ajax caching". i'm trying to aggressively cache ajax responses. i'm setting cache-control:max-age=3600, public on the responses, but the server is being hit every time. i see no cache busting in the ajax request generated by jquery. any ideas how i can force browser caching?
[14:58:34] <robertmaxrees> because there are a ton of gotchas here, derekZero_
[14:58:50] <derekZero_> royalty If you make turn #parent's opacity: 0; property into a comment you'll see the text.
[14:59:19] <derekZero_> I want #parent div to .addClass .is-showing when the user scrolls on it.
[14:59:22] <robertmaxrees> PapaSierra do you have an expires header?
[14:59:46] <robertmaxrees> PapaSierra https://blog.httpwatch.com/2009/08/07/ajax-caching-two-important-facts/
[15:00:04] <PapaSierra> robertmaxrees: http://hastebin.com/raw/emuvinixep
[15:00:12] <royalty> derekZero_, http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vNaggq i can't see the text
[15:00:33] <robertmaxrees> PapaSierra check out the link i just tossed out.
[15:00:35] <robertmaxrees> some good info.
[15:00:43] <robertmaxrees> that JS is scary
[15:00:49] <PapaSierra> robertmaxrees: awesome, thanks for the link. reading now
[15:01:02] <derekZero_> royalty http://codepen.io/anon/pen/yYqgMo There you go
[15:01:54] <robertmaxrees> derekZero_ what's with the timeout in that each?
[15:01:55] <royalty> derekZero_, my point is the transition isn't even working when adding the class
[15:02:44] <robertmaxrees> oh you want to fade each one in sequentially.
[15:03:10] <royalty> derekZero_, i think this is the css you want... http://codepen.io/anon/pen/NGBdjR
[15:03:14] <royalty> not even sure but whatevs
[15:03:39] <robertmaxrees> your js should look more like this.
[15:05:24] <robertmaxrees> crap lost the link.  haha
[15:06:06] <robertmaxrees> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/XmBpRq there we go.
[15:12:54] <derekZero_> royalty Sorry, lost connection. Did you discover anything?
[15:13:11] <robertmaxrees> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/XmBpRq derekZero_ fwiw
[15:13:52] <derekZero_> robertmaxrees what's fwiw?
[15:14:05] <robertmaxrees> "for what it's worth"
[15:14:10] <derekZero_> ah
[15:14:11] <robertmaxrees> your JS had some pretty bad gotchas in it.
[15:14:17] <derekZero_> How so?
[15:14:36] <robertmaxrees> using $() inside a resize/scroll event handler is a big no-no if you can avoid iut.
[15:14:47] <derekZero_> hm
[15:15:00] <robertmaxrees> you should select and store those outside first.
[15:15:08] <robertmaxrees> because the jquery constructor is a very expensive operation.
[15:16:20] <derekZero_> I see. Much cleaner robertmaxrees.
[15:16:47] <derekZero_> I'm still confused as to why the text won't transition it's opacity property on scroll.
[15:17:15] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have a question about css transitions, then,.
[15:18:30] <derekZero_> robertmaxrees You have no doubt the JS is actually adding the class is-showing?
[15:19:01] <derekZero_> I'm not quite sure which script the problem is in. It's just not cohesive for some reason.
[15:19:49] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to sequentially fade each of those divs in?
[15:21:15] <derekZero_> Yes, by an eq of 150 miliseconds
[15:21:54] <derekZero_> Well, with this new syntax, just by 150 milliseconds :)
[15:22:03] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16867887/how-can-i-sequentially-fade-in-several-divs
[15:24:19] <PapaSierra> robertmaxrees: i've read your link about caching. i believe i was doing everything right. i've isolated the issue to chrome vs firefox. firefox obeys the cache-control/expires and correctly suppresses a server round trip. chrome however hits the server regardless. i'm a little unclear if this is just a browser behaviour or if my headers are wrong
[15:25:18] <robertmaxrees> PapaSierra do you understand what those headers are supposed to do?
[15:25:29] <robertmaxrees> are you setting the cache control ones far enough in the future, for instance?
[15:26:12] <PapaSierra> yes. cache-control public says that any intermidiary caches are allows to cache it. and expires 3600 says that there is no need to request the resource for the next hour
[15:26:32] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it then.
[15:26:45] <robertmaxrees> but chrome is pretty nonaggressive when it comes to caching client-side.
[15:26:46] <derekZero_> thx
[15:27:01] <PapaSierra> robertmaxrees: here's an example http://hastebin.com/raw/emuvinixep
[15:28:11] <robertmaxrees> where's your last-modified?
[15:30:05] <PapaSierra> robertmaxrees: i've tried it once with and once without. when i had it present, firefox obeyed it, but chrome ignore it
[15:30:14] <robertmaxrees> right, so you want it there.
[15:30:14] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:31:10] <PapaSierra> robertmaxrees: right, i'm putting it back in now. but still, chrome still does the server round trip
[15:31:24] <robertmaxrees> not sure then.  i'd have to play wit it.
[15:31:25] <robertmaxrees> *with
[15:33:01] <PapaSierra> robertmaxrees: sure, if it's just chrome deciding against it and there's nothing i can do, then i'll accept that
[15:33:02] <PapaSierra> thanks
[16:19:24] <fortiffied> Yo, ok so when keyup is fired
[16:19:36] <fortiffied> Is there any nice way to confirm the vallue is actually changed in a textbox?
[16:19:44] <jakeFat> anyone can figure out how to " H3155719" into the search bar http://www.realtor.ca/ and retrieve the url http://www.realtor.ca/Commercial/Retail/15693497/222-KENILWORTH-Avenue-North-HAMILTON-Ontario-L8H4S2 via curl or any http client?
[17:27:09] <derekZero_> robertmaxrees Just looked at the link. That's close to what I'm trying to do, but instead of firing on a time delay I want it to be effected by the user scrolling.
[17:37:28] <robertmaxrees> derekZero_ same diff really.
[17:37:47] <robertmaxrees> the way you fire it is agnostic to what happens.
[17:38:24] <derekZero_> robertmaxrees Well one way could have them fire somewhere below the screen, the other way would fire them when the user is looking at it.
[17:38:40] <robertmaxrees> sure, but that's irrelevant to what happens.
[17:38:51] <derekZero_> If an effect eases in a forest, and no one is around to see it, is it still cool?
[17:38:55] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating "event binding" and "event handler"
[17:39:28] <robertmaxrees> the when and the what are only sort of related.
[17:39:29] <robertmaxrees> brb
[17:47:56] <huck5> Can you take a look at this code snippet and let me know possible reasons $(...).datepicker doesn't exist? https://gist.github.com/Huck5/7dcce56598ba2373a03e ? Is it the order I'm importing my jquery in the wrong order or somethign?
[17:48:25] <robertmaxrees> onclick is the wrong way to do that fwiw.
[17:48:40] <huck5> Yeah, you mentioned doing $(..).on('click', ...)
[17:48:44] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:49:04] <huck5> Hum.. Ok! But doing $().onclick should still pick up the datepicker shouldn't it? Or could that be the reason right there?
[17:49:13] <Bootinbull> Has anyone used the data tables(1.10) plugin with server side processing? I'm trying to figure out how best to extend the ssp class to be able to join tables. The documentation seems a bit thin on this subject.
[17:49:25] <robertmaxrees> $(&quot;#uField_5&quot;) huck5 this isn't anything.
[17:49:57] <robertmaxrees> huck5 also, why are you initializing it on click?
[17:50:01] <huck5> Surprisingly it is... Maybe it's the jsp converting it. But the onclick funciton is called - i just get console complaining about not being able to find the datepicker() function
[17:50:17] <huck5> robertmaxrees, I'm doing it this way simply because of a template I am basing it on.
[17:50:23] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:50:25] <huck5> That's.. how it is done.
[17:50:25] <robertmaxrees> welp.
[17:50:32] <huck5> Haha, start again?
[17:50:34] <robertmaxrees> because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xL4jqr8c/
[17:50:40] <robertmaxrees> really is this simple.
[17:50:43] <robertmaxrees> no need to init in onclick.
[17:51:45] <huck5> Oh I think I see what I did. I included jquery min twice -.-' ugh.
[17:51:53] <robertmaxrees> and your js is bad.
[17:51:59] <robertmaxrees> move it into a separate js file.
[17:52:05] <robertmaxrees> and actually use quotes.
[17:52:33] <huck5> robertmaxrees, yep already am. Just pasted it like that for an example. Thank you for your insight :)
[17:53:11] <robertmaxrees> where are you including jquery twice?
[17:53:15] <robertmaxrees> your example doesn't have that.

[18:07:27] <bigredradio> I put my question in the comment. Not sure why, but I cannot enter mickey in the empty text box and the correct form is located. If I put the value into the html element, then it works.

[18:12:35] <LindsayMac> is trying to get a form to submit a file upload via ajax a waste of time?
[18:12:41] <LindsayMac> because i've been trying ALL DAY and nothing...
[18:13:20] <robertmaxrees> totally depends on the project.
[18:13:48] <LindsayMac> is it a difficult, non-standard thing to try to do?
[18:14:10] <LindsayMac> i have a profile. I want to let people upload a photo as their profile and I want it to feel more seamless
[18:14:24] <robertmaxrees> it's a little awkward mostly because people conflate a lot of the technique involved.
[18:15:19] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  any good articles that donbt do that? because now i'm confused as ever
[18:15:20] <LindsayMac> lol
[18:19:13] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees: this is what I have thus far http://jsfiddle.net/42vdh5rd/
[18:20:41] <bigredradio> Trying to get input[value= to work on values that are not already set in the html. http://jsfiddle.net/upun6hxf/4/
[18:20:54] <robertmaxrees> bigredradio you want .filter()
[18:21:04] <robertmaxrees> what you have there relies on the html having a given value.
[18:21:13] <robertmaxrees> though this makes me wonder why you'd do that.
[18:21:23] <robertmaxrees> and get used to using console.log() instead of alert() btw :)
[18:21:34] <bigredradio> robertmaxrees, it's just a roughexample

[18:23:20] <LindsayMac> i cant believe this has taken a whole day
[18:23:22] <robertmaxrees> .filter() is your friend.
[18:24:32] <LindsayMac> think i'm ready to just say screw it and leave a "save" button
[18:24:50] <robertmaxrees> LindsayMac have you checked to make sure the network request is successful?
[18:24:55] <robertmaxrees> like, what part of this isn't working?
[18:25:16] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees: $_FILES or $_POST is empty so its not actually sending proper data
[18:25:26] <robertmaxrees> LindsayMac and from the network tab?
[18:25:26] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  when I var_dump the new formData stuff there's nothing in it
[18:25:38] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  it shows [object] [OBJECT]
[18:25:45] <robertmaxrees> in the network tab?
[18:25:49] <robertmaxrees> or the console?
[18:26:00] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  in network tab http://cl.ly/image/3c112j0s0a1n

[18:27:38] <robertmaxrees> LindsayMac are you in ES6 land or no?
[18:27:44] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  nope
[18:27:47] <LindsayMac> def not
[18:27:52] <robertmaxrees> you have an error in your ajax call then.
[18:27:54] <robertmaxrees> fix that.
[18:28:16] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  i do?
[18:28:25] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:28:29] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  its not returning an actual error.. so i'm not sure where to look
[18:28:29] <robertmaxrees> use a linter.
[18:28:44] <robertmaxrees> data: {data} isn't valid unless you're in ES6 land.
[18:29:23] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees: Ah ok.. oops. That was a mistake in my fiddle but fixed http://jsfiddle.net/42vdh5rd/1/
[18:30:17] <robertmaxrees> and nothing about cors or anything like that?
[18:31:00] <LindsayMac> cors?
[18:31:29] <robertmaxrees> are you sending to a server that's on a different port, protocol, and/or domain?
[18:31:30] <derekZero_> I think it's a beer
[18:31:36] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  nope
[18:31:41] <LindsayMac> derekZero_: thats COORS lol
[18:31:43] <derekZero_> cors light was developed with less calories
[18:31:45] <robertmaxrees> https://css-tricks.com/ajax-image-uploading/
[18:31:49] <derekZero_> xD t'was a joke
[18:32:09] <robertmaxrees> also: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[18:32:16] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to use formdata if you want to support old IE.
[18:32:19] <derekZero_> I should stick to CSS jokes...
[18:32:25] <derekZero_> They're more my style.
[18:32:32] * derekZero_ B) 
[18:32:43] <robertmaxrees> also, var data = new FormData('form#uploadfile'); isn't right - you need to pass the object, not a selector.
[18:32:46] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees: ok.. so thats a plugin.. which is fine.. but if i'm NOT supporting old IE, why wouldnt my code work ?
[18:32:56] <LindsayMac> (i'll use that plugin but just curious as towhy this doesnt work)
[18:33:23] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  i had previously had the file obkect.. do I need to pass the whole form object?
[18:35:06] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees: also ew FormData($('form#uploadfile')); ??
[18:35:09] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:35:16] <robertmaxrees> you need the raw dom node.
[18:35:34] <LindsayMac> turns it into an object, right?
[18:35:47] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[18:36:01] <robertmaxrees> something here seems way off.
[18:36:21] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  lol its possible. i have done SOOOO many different methods for this
[18:36:23] <robertmaxrees> jQuery('input[type=file]').on('change', prepareUpload); and jQuery('form#uploadfile').submit(uploadFiles); - your code doesn't make any sense.
[18:37:07] <robertmaxrees> function uploadFiles(file) { is getting called in that submit, but the "file" arg is the event object in that case.
[18:37:35] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  oh. I may have gotten my JS and my PHP confused in that case
[18:37:52] <robertmaxrees> you want the same thing to happen regardless of the input change or forum submit?
[18:37:59] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  i was first trying to run the code on click of upload but initially the goal was to auto-upload
[18:38:03] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees: yea
[18:38:22] <robertmaxrees> then just do jQuery('#uploadfile').on('change submit', uploadFiles);
[18:38:24] <LindsayMac> either trigger the save on form submit OR on change.. I suppose I could take out thef orm submit IF i could get it to work on change
[18:38:29] <robertmaxrees> no need to have both of those bindings.
[18:38:43] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  yea.. it was from me trying two different methods
[18:39:15] <robertmaxrees> that'
[18:39:21] <robertmaxrees> *that's why you were tripping yourself up.
[18:39:27] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  what confuses me is that file is there, it has the file data... but i cant get it to pass in the ajax post
[18:39:37] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[18:40:46] <LindsayMac> ok..
[18:41:37] <robertmaxrees> you want something closer to this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/42vdh5rd/3/
[18:42:53] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  so prepareUploads is unneccessary?
[18:43:01] <robertmaxrees> it didn
[18:43:06] <robertmaxrees> *it didn't make any sense.
[18:43:16] <robertmaxrees> i didn't understand what you were trying to do with that.
[18:43:31] <robertmaxrees> all event bindings pass the same thing to their handlers for arguments.
[18:44:26] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  i wish I could say I had a reason but... honestly... it was me following a tutorial
[18:44:30] <LindsayMac> which all seemed half baked to me
[18:44:38] <robertmaxrees> have a link?
[18:44:48] <LindsayMac> To the tutorial I was looking at? sure.
[18:46:08] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  it was a mash up of a few but.. http://abandon.ie/notebook/simple-file-uploads-using-jquery-ajax
[18:46:38] <robertmaxrees> noooo
[18:47:08] <robertmaxrees> so this was "prepping" the file input to be ready for the submit, but that's gross - just do it in the submit handler./
[18:47:17] <robertmaxrees> the global "file" state was bad.
[18:47:22] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees: this is why I prefer IRC than random tutorials
[18:47:24] <LindsayMac> but yea....
[18:47:34] <LindsayMac> Understood. I thought it was weird once i figured out what it was doing
[18:48:11] <robertmaxrees> errr, but if you understood it why were you still using it? ;)
[18:48:28] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees: I tend to overly trust that tutorials know more than me when it comes to js
[18:48:50] <robertmaxrees> that tutorial works, but you modified it in a way that didn't make any sense ;)
[18:49:16] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  yea because I was trying to also add the action to the data passed
[18:49:23] <LindsayMac> (WP requires the action be inside the data)
[18:49:31] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty gross.
[18:49:39] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  oh i know...
[18:49:49] <robertmaxrees> they should trust the http method.
[18:49:59] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  basically it asks you to register your action's name and then you pass it as an "action" to the registration
[18:50:12] <LindsayMac> its not THAT bad .. but i believe it's to control priviledged access to posting to the server
[18:50:33] <robertmaxrees> that should be handled by authentication and CORS
[18:50:53] <robertmaxrees> you sure that action isn't supposed to be the http action?
[18:51:06] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees: 100%
[18:51:10] <robertmaxrees> that's gross.
[18:51:16] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  if it's one thing I know well its WP
[18:51:22] <LindsayMac> and it's wacky ways
[18:51:48] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  remember WP was developed for the "lowest barrier to entry" for "bad devs"
[18:51:52] <LindsayMac> they had to account for idiots
[18:52:05] <robertmaxrees> WP was developed to as a blogging platform that grew into a CMS ;)
[18:52:12] <robertmaxrees> but i know what you're trying to get at.
[18:52:19] <OnceMe> how can I check if element was visible for more than 10seconds?
[18:52:27] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe wat
[18:52:33] <LindsayMac> that too.. but the programming (and even why they went with PHP and their dirty loops) is for beginner devs to jump in easily
[18:53:33] <OnceMe> robertmaxrees:I append some element after some action, and I have another function/method which sometimes doesnt work, so I want to make sure that element is not available if 10 seconds passed, from the first append.
[18:53:57] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe still not making sense.  why wouldn't the element exist?
[18:54:51] <OnceMe> ?
[18:55:20] <robertmaxrees> try explaining again, maybe?
[18:55:35] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:  you want to count how long an element is visible.. what are you using to make it visible/ hidden?
[18:55:46] <robertmaxrees> that's an assumption.
[18:55:53] <robertmaxrees> they just sayd they don't know if it is/isn't available.
[18:56:06] <robertmaxrees> *said.  the problem statement is really unusual.
[18:57:19] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees: true.. was just trying to get clarification frm the guy
[18:57:44] <OnceMe> well I have some event which occurs
[18:58:07] <OnceMe> but that event might not occur always, so I simply want to set some counter, so if that didnt occured, fine, just remove appended element
[18:58:40] <robertmaxrees> so something gets added, and if nothing else happens a particular interval, remove it?
[18:58:41] <LindsayMac> wouldnt a callback to start a counter after its triggered work?
[18:58:56] <robertmaxrees> the ux here sounds really confusing.
[18:59:51] <LindsayMac> agreed.
[19:00:10] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:  maybe some code can explain it bette.r. show the code you're doing to do all your showing and hiding and put a comment where you want things to happen
[19:03:15] <derekZero_> LindsayMac Would you happen to know why this text isn't fading in on scroll? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vNagXw
[19:03:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:03:29] <robertmaxrees> derekZero_ did you ever ask in #css?
[19:03:38] <robertmaxrees> also, that JS is still really bad.
[19:03:40] <derekZero_> Sure did
[19:03:46] <robertmaxrees> what did they tell you?
[19:03:54] <derekZero_> No one's gotten back yet
[19:04:06] <derekZero_> The JS works. Just not in this context.
[19:05:19] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[19:05:25] <robertmaxrees> whatevs then mano.
[19:06:14] <derekZero_> You didn't have a solution, which is why I deferred the question to different eyes.
[19:06:14] <LindsayMac> derekZero_: you have opacity set to 0 on the parent
[19:06:16] <robertmaxrees> also // isn't a valid css comment.
[19:06:23] <LindsayMac> derekZero_:  thats going to make EVERYTHING invisible
[19:06:43] <robertmaxrees> derekZero_ i still had relevant advice.
[19:06:54] <derekZero_> LindsayMac I want the parent to be invisible until you scroll over it. Then it would fade in upon scrolling over the element.
[19:07:19] <derekZero_> robertmaxrees It effectively nullifies the line of code.
[19:07:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:07:42] <LindsayMac> derekZero_:  no the PARENT should not be zero.. the children should
[19:08:23] <derekZero_> I tried that before LindsayMac. I'll give it another go. Something else may have been amiss last time I tried that.
[19:09:07] <LindsayMac> derekZero_:  a LOT is amiss in that code honestly
[19:09:15] <derekZero_> I bet
[19:09:19] <robertmaxrees> LindsayMac they don't want to hear about it ;)
[19:09:27] <derekZero_> I've gone back and forth a few times to get my knots in a twist.
[19:09:41] <derekZero_> robertmaxrees Who are they?
[19:09:45] <robertmaxrees> you.
[19:09:53] <LindsayMac> derekZero_:  i would recommend you scrap it ALL and start over in that case
[19:09:56] <robertmaxrees> you just didn't seem interested in my general suggestions.
[19:10:14] <LindsayMac> derekZero_:  when you find yourself applying patch after patch from different places you are best starting over with ONE tutorial or snippet that has a demo that you can see working
[19:10:50] <robertmaxrees> also: the js is working fine.
[19:10:55] <robertmaxrees> the css is what isn't working correctly.
[19:11:02] <derekZero_> robertmaxrees You didn't direct me to my goal of creating an effect reacting to scroll. Your solution was a short hand and only created a time delay. This doesn't fit the context of my project.
[19:11:04] <robertmaxrees> i can watch the inspector properly fire those calsses.
[19:11:22] <derekZero_> LindsayMac Here's child with the opacity property http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vNagXw
[19:11:30] <robertmaxrees> derekZero_ the js functions fine, either way.
[19:11:34] <robertmaxrees> so fix up the css and you should be fine :)
[19:11:42] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  ah you're right. my scrolelr must have just added them.. it doesnt remove them when you scroll back
[19:11:47] <derekZero_> robertmaxrees thx. That is what is confusing me.
[19:11:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so head over to #css and stick it out.
[19:12:00] <robertmaxrees> somebody will be able to help you :)
[19:12:04] <derekZero_> here's to hoping.
[19:12:44] <LindsayMac> derekZero_: here's a hint.. CSS is CASCADING.. if a selector isn't as descriptive it holds less weight and thus gets overwritten by the more descriptive one.
[19:13:12] <LindsayMac> derekZero_:  browser windows show you this cascade when you view the HTML elements in the right hand column of a web inspector.
[19:13:17] <LindsayMac> derekZero_: your cascading is bad
[19:13:17] <MAxou> is possible to do in jquery and ajax : a checkbox which when i click will ask for delete the line from my html table and the record in sql witheout page reloading ?
[19:13:33] <derekZero_> LindsayMac Good point... I do select the div as div instead of it's id.
[19:13:42] <robertmaxrees> MAxou you'll need some kind of server-side technology to help there.
[19:13:52] <robertmaxrees> JS can't directly talk to your database.
[19:13:59] <MAxou> and php too
[19:14:06] <LindsayMac> derekZero_: thats def. a good question for #css
[19:14:10] <LindsayMac> now that you know how to word it.
[19:14:13] <LindsayMac> derekZero_:  or google even
[19:14:27] <derekZero_> LindsayMac Thx. Very helpful.
[19:14:41] <MAxou> robertmaxrees with php + jquery + ajax i can ?
[19:14:41] <LindsayMac> derekZero_:  at least that is the issue I could see anyways.
[19:14:48] <robertmaxrees> MAxou yep.
[19:14:53] <LindsayMac> MAxou:  doing it right now
[19:14:54] <derekZero_> It's a start.
[19:15:17] <MAxou> LindsayMac : oh ! help me plz ;p
[19:15:29] <robertmaxrees> MAxou did you have any other jquery questions?
[19:15:41] <LindsayMac> MAxou:  go into the proper rooms for each question and ask specific questions and help you shall receive
[19:16:08] <MAxou> ;)
[19:16:13] <robertmaxrees> get the php part done first.
[19:16:22] <robertmaxrees> add the js bits later.
[19:16:35] <MAxou> the part is easy
[19:16:40] <MAxou> php
[19:18:44] <LindsayMac> MAxou:  so figure out what you need in your PHP and start building up your ajax.
[19:19:00] <LindsayMac> MAxou:  you gotta have more specific questions though
[19:23:57] <paffy> I wrote a language and need to visualize the parse tree in JS. Can someone recommend a simple library for drawing a vertical tree-like structure for my Syntax Tree?
[19:24:29] <MAxou> LindsayMac ok
[19:27:06] <LindsayMac> MAxou: its not too hard if you're just dealing with some basic interactions and data
[19:30:12] <MAxou> like you said I do my html/php to work with page reload then i will ask for add jquery and ajax to do witheout reloading
[19:30:36] <LindsayMac> yup
[19:32:28] * derekZero_ posts skeleton meme captioned: Me waiting for #css to acknowledge me :) 
[19:36:03] <LindsayMac> derekZero_: the google can help you too.. you dont NEED an IRC person
[19:36:53] <derekZero_> LindsayMac True. I've just been finicking with the test case. I should probably do some Googling.
[19:37:08] <LindsayMac> derekZero_: you should not need someone to tell you to google ti
[19:37:23] <derekZero_> LindsayMac I like to finick.
[19:40:04] <LindsayMac> derekZero_:  stil... always google BEFORE asking
[19:40:40] <derekZero_> LindsayMac I did. Do you know something I don't?
[19:40:54] <LindsayMac> yea.. i know your cascading references are wrong
[19:40:58] <LindsayMac> and bad
[19:42:02] <derekZero_> LindsayMac I think gramatically you just used a tautology.
[19:43:47] <LindsayMac> its not a universal truth so no clue what you're talking about
[19:44:44] <derekZero_> LindsayMac Tautology doesn't reference universality, so now you're implementing non-sequiter.
[19:45:34] <LindsayMac> derekZero_: Tautology (logic), a universal truth in formal logic
[19:45:42] <LindsayMac> derekZero_: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic)
[19:46:25] <derekZero_> Consider the context I used it in. https://www.google.com/search?q=define+tautology&oq=define+tautology&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2067j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=122&ie=UTF-8
[19:46:43] <LindsayMac> derekZero_:  no thanks..
[19:46:57] <derekZero_> LindsayMac Now who doesn't like Google?
[19:48:22] <LindsayMac> derekZero_: youre not very likable..
[19:51:04] <derekZero_> LindsayMac Not many people are likable when you open the conversation as "you should not need someone to tell you to google ti"
[19:51:23] <LindsayMac> derekZero_:  came to that conclusion before all that
[19:53:49] <MAxou> Ok my update button work in my html table when i click on it I go on the delete.php page and that's work
[19:54:03] <MAxou> now i want same thing wiethoue changing page
[19:54:43] <derekZero_> LindayMac I'm sorry you feel that way. Feel free to ignore me :) I hope you have a great day.
[19:54:55] <z1haze> Can anyone please help me with showing a progess bar when submitting a form via ajax
[19:55:10] <LindsayMac> MAxou:  so now look up the jQuery.ajax({}) function
[19:55:52] <LindsayMac> MAxou:  you have to use JS to build the data: attribute of the ajax function by getting the value of your fields..
[20:02:18] <MAxou> i find a video tutorial
[20:02:23] <MAxou> i try to follow it
[20:03:01] <LindsayMac> MAxou:  you should be able to find examples of code all over google
[20:08:40] <derekZero_> MAxou Let me know if this is helpful http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4527914/i-cant-update-the-progressbar-via-ajax-on-form-submit
[20:11:28] <MAxou> it's so easy
[20:11:38] <derekZero_> Cool
[20:11:55] <LindsayMac> MAxou:  $,ajax is super easy
[20:12:08] <MAxou> yeah and so useful
[20:39:08] <MAxou> i try id = $(this).find("input[name=id]").val(); on <input type="hidden"  name="ss_id"  value="<?php echo $row['ss_id'];?>"> but no work
[22:07:50] <MAxou> Can I change the value of a TD with jquery ,
[22:10:26] <arc_> value is not a valid property of td
[22:10:34] <arc_> if you mean the inner html, yes of course
[22:12:21] <MAxou> innner html yes
[22:12:30] <MAxou> beetwyn <td></td>
[22:12:36] <MAxou> how arc_ ?
[22:14:51] <arc_> MAxou http://api.jquery.com/html/
[22:17:13] <MAxou> thx arc
[22:25:24] <derekZero_> is .addId a thing?
[22:30:07] <arc_> derekZero_ just use attr
[22:34:55] <Anniepoo> I have an svg in a div container with overflow:scroll - how can I get the width of the area of SVG showing, inside the scroll bars?
[22:36:01] <kevireilly> Anniepoo: define the appropriate width
[22:37:04] <Anniepoo> sorry kevi, not understanding
[22:37:45] <derekZero_> arc What's the syntax for that?
[22:37:53] <derekZero_> nvm, I'll look it up.
[22:38:01] <kevireilly> perhaps I'm not understanding the issue, but if you've got a scroll area that isn't wide enough, it might be because you need to define a specific width that represents the viewport area that you would like to be scrollable
[22:38:08] <Anniepoo> no
[22:38:16] <Anniepoo> the scroll bars are wanted
[22:38:19] <MAxou> can i dot this : $('#seloger_table tr[data-value-budgetmax=ss_id]').hide();
[22:38:27] <MAxou> if ss_id is a var ?
[22:38:37] <Anniepoo> but I need to know what part of the SVG is visible
[22:38:38] <derekZero_> thx arc_
[22:39:07] <Anniepoo> so I need to get the width of the container's inside part
[22:39:31] <Anniepoo> $("#svgcontainer").widthinsidescrollbars()
[22:43:23] <MAxou> if ss_id is a var ?
[22:43:25] <MAxou> can i dot this : $('#seloger_table tr[data-value-budgetmax=ss_id]').hide();
[22:46:13] <kevireilly> Anniepoo: $('#svgcontainer').innerWidth();
[22:49:01] <Anniepoo> no, just checked that by experiment
[22:49:22] <Anniepoo> gives same number as width for my example (no padding).
[22:52:53] <Anniepoo> getting the raw DOM object and using scrollWidth gives the contained element's size
[22:56:21] <Anniepoo> clientHeight
[22:57:17] <Anniepoo> $("#svgcontainer").get(0).clientWidth;
[22:57:32] <Anniepoo> 8cD
[23:40:52] <corbyhaas> Can jQuery call events on a selected element that are not in the API, but native to the element? For example $(window).onhashchange(dostuff)?
[23:41:08] <corbyhaas> I'm on mobile or I'd test myself real quick.
[23:53:53] <Jonno_FT1> I'm having a problem where I add and remove elements and want a .click() handler for them, but when I add the elements, the handler isn't called when they are clicked
[23:58:23] <Jonno_FTW> nvm, I was using .on wrong
[23:59:06] <corbyhaas> W/r/t my previous question, it works just fine. Takes a minute to type that into a shell on mobile though :-p.
[23:59:18] <corbyhaas> jQuery is great!
