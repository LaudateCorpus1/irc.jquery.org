[00:00:04] <gnarf> databack: seeing obviously what is within/beside/inside/above another element
[00:00:11] <codacoder> databack: visualising nested strcutures
[00:00:25] <databack> i guess im old school
[00:00:27] <databack> lol
[00:00:44] <gnarf> codacoder: dunno if i'll be around much tomorrow
[00:00:56] <codacoder> databack - go look and have your socks blown off
[00:01:00] <gnarf> codacoder: but seriously, I'd like to see the reduced test here ;)
[00:01:17] <codacoder> me too - it's my job maaan ;)
[00:01:52] <codacoder> so duck punch is a paul-irishism?
[00:02:09] <gnarf> codacoder: nah, came from some ruby thing
[00:02:23] <gnarf> http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/programs/1/episodes/railsconf-2007 apparently
[00:02:44] <gnarf> "Adam Keys: Yeah, exactly. Way down in Dallas, in the Dallas Ruby Brigade, we believe that monkey-patching, while it’s served us well, the time has come for some new terminology there. So while you have duck-typing in Ruby, we believe that monkey-patching should become duck-punching."
[00:03:37] <codacoder> lol - deep and meaningless as an old friend used to say ;)
[00:05:17] <gnarf> codacoder: we had a recent bug where a plugin had duck punched a method, but used .call() to pass along the arguments instead of .apply()
[00:05:35] <gnarf> codacoder: broke down in the internals where we checked arguments.length for something
[00:06:29] <codacoder> i'll remove the .min tomorrow and see if that 'a' is undefined goes away
[00:06:40] <gnarf> codacoder: punching jQuery.fn.remove seems plausible, and since it has that hidden boolean parameter to turn it into "detach" instead of "remove"
[00:06:48] <gnarf> codacoder: at least it wont be "a" :)
[00:06:59] <gnarf> codacoder: it will probably still be undefined
[00:07:01] <codacoder> i only upped to .2 yesterday
[00:07:20] <gnarf> codacoder: 1.7.1 doesn't have the same problem?
[00:07:51] <codacoder> not sure... but that jquery error has oinly appeared sinc then (if that's what you're asking)
[00:08:06] <codacoder> my code is "newer" than the .7 upgrae
[00:08:11] <codacoder> .2*
[00:08:39] <gnarf> i was referring to the detach issue
[00:08:49] <codacoder> it's changed...
[00:08:54] <codacoder> let me explain...
[00:09:17] <codacoder> I was, for brevity, attaching clicks via .class selectors
[00:09:43] <codacoder> but i hit a problem - the .off() sanity code was failing and I never found out why
[00:10:01] <codacoder> so i switched to using ids....
[00:10:16] <codacoder> THEN i hit the lost clicks issue we're seeing ow
[00:10:54] <codacoder> so the off() issue appeared after 1.7.2
[00:11:07] <codacoder> which caused me to rewrite to attach via ids
[00:11:19] <codacoder> and THAT showed up the issue in detach
[00:11:21] <gnarf> codacoder: not sure what the original problem is, but it seems like you are adding and removing events from dynamically generated content?
[00:11:30] <codacoder> you got it
[00:11:40] <gnarf> codacoder: why aren't you using delegated events on the container?
[00:11:52] <codacoder> no reason
[00:12:06] <gnarf> codacoder: its probably better/saner
[00:12:10] <codacoder> it would be a much higher ancestor tho...
[00:12:15] <codacoder> you're right
[00:12:24] <codacoder> woods, trees...
[00:12:24] <gnarf> to say $("#container").bind( "click", ".thisThing", handler );
[00:12:29] <gnarf> er rather .on()
[00:12:30] <gnarf> sorry
[00:12:42] <codacoder> yeah - i'm all on now ;)
[00:12:59] <codacoder> that off thing drove me nuts
[00:13:07] <gnarf> that way no events/data are on the dom objects at all
[00:13:11] <codacoder> it works everywhere else
[00:13:12] <gnarf> its just the container
[00:13:20] <codacoder> yep - i got that
[00:13:30] <gnarf> you wont need to disable events, because if they aren't in container, they don't have them
[00:13:30] <gnarf> :)
[00:13:51] <codacoder> yep - i got it... like i said, woods and trees
[00:13:58] <gnarf> and if you DO need to disable events for some reason on a single guy, you can bind a stopPropagation event
[00:14:08] <codacoder> course
[00:14:37] <codacoder> but us being us... we still want to know what's causing this error (right?) :)
[00:14:51] <gnarf> codacoder: i still wouldn't mind tracking down the detach issue anyway, but you should rewrite to be the sane/clean method either way as well
[00:15:03] <codacoder> there ya go ;)
[00:15:41] <gnarf> codacoder: if you could reduce it down to a console.log before a .detach() and a console.log after a .detach() showing any change in the data
[00:15:43] <gnarf> its a bug
[00:16:00] <codacoder> yep - I'll do that
[00:16:05] <codacoder> tomorrow tho
[00:16:15] <codacoder> totally shagged
[00:16:16] <gnarf> although i think you're gonna have to reproduce the "framed" environment to make it happen :)
[00:16:36] <codacoder> yeah - i'm worried about that too now.
[00:16:50] <gnarf> use jsbin
[00:16:58] <codacoder> k
[00:17:00] <gnarf> and embed one jsbin inside another with the frame
[00:18:26] <codacoder> u on twitter gnarf?
[00:18:30] <gnarf> @gnarf37
[00:18:58] <gnarf> still trying to get one of my twitter friends to blow up @gnarf and change my handle ;)
[00:19:21] <codacoder> lol
[00:19:40] <codacoder> ok, since it's friday... you been stalked ;)
[00:21:06] <codacoder> i'm outa here - thanks man
[00:22:47] <jedimind> gnarf
[00:22:56] <jedimind> if i had a hero in life,
[00:23:04] <jedimind> it wouldnt be you, but you would be his sidekick
[00:24:17] <tw2113> *snorts*
[00:24:21] <gnarf> jedimind: lol
[00:24:43] <tw2113> wait what? gnarf is my sidekick?
[00:24:43] <jedimind> <3
[00:24:51] <jedimind> tw2113, dont flatter yourself
[00:25:01] <tw2113> *kicks dirt*
[00:26:36] <jedimind> also i wrote a blog thing today
[00:26:46] <jedimind> http://bnotions.com/form-select-replacement-using-jquery-css/
[00:26:55] <jedimind> you should all read it and laugh at its absurdity
[00:27:22] <gnarf> jedimind: heh
[00:27:33] <gnarf> jedimind: have you seen "Chosen" btw?
[00:27:38] <gnarf> jedimind: on the topic of selectmenu's
[00:27:39] <jedimind> the movie?
[00:27:49] <gnarf> http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[00:28:01] <jedimind> yeah ive seen it
[00:28:10] <gnarf> kinda in love with that thing
[00:28:12] <jedimind> mine is ... 1% of the code and a concept more than a plugin
[00:28:16] <gnarf> although I've not had a reason to use it
[00:28:21] <jedimind> yeah
[00:28:23] <gnarf> jedimind: yeah, and solid
[00:28:32] <jedimind> that was my problem for so long with masonry/isotope
[00:28:39] <jedimind> i was in love with it but couldnt find a place to use it
[00:29:05] <gnarf> I spent most of my day trying to help correct someone spreading bad information on twitter
[00:29:36] <jedimind> the tutorial is kind of admittedly lame, but i at least try to enforce some basic standards and best practices
[00:34:03] <kurrent> the {foo:'bar'} is JSON bad information?
[00:34:50] <kurrent> i think i caught some of that
[00:39:14] <gnarf> kurrent: yeah some guy obviously thinking that "object literal" and "JSON" are interoperable words
[00:39:32] <gnarf> "the first argument to animate is a JSON with the properties..." or something to that extent
[00:54:39] <martisj> is there a separate channel for jquery ui ?
[00:56:31] <gnarf> martisj: nope
[00:56:58] <ghj> there's #jqueryui-dev though
[00:57:15] <ghj> but I guess it's for those who make it, not for general help
[00:57:20] <ghj> for client help*
[00:57:28] <martisj> gnarf: aha.
[00:57:44] <martisj> well anyway no worries
[00:57:57] <gnarf> yeah the -dev channels are for the developers
[00:58:21] <martisj> frustrating coz i am trying to edit the jquery.ui.dialog.js but my colleague has just included the jquery-ui-custom.min :(
[00:59:26] <ghj> and?
[00:59:30] <ghj> where's the problem?
[01:00:54] <martisj> the problem is that it's difficult to edit minified code
[01:01:02] <martisj> at least in my editor
[01:01:19] <martisj> ghj: i want to edit the html that is generated with the dialog widget
[01:02:26] <ghj> well, if the code is included through <script>, you can temporarily edit the page with the browser inspector
[01:02:34] <ghj> and change the url it points to
[01:03:11] <martisj> ghj: and is there a quick way to change it permanently in the minified js
[01:03:46] <gnarf> martisj: why are you editing the html?
[01:03:50] <ghj> guess you could minify your code independently from the 'official' version
[01:04:02] <gnarf> martisj: you can extend the widget itself and provide your change as an "extension"
[01:04:24] <martisj> gnarf: ahhhhhhhh :)
[01:04:31] <martisj> that's what i was looking for:)
[01:04:34] <martisj> how would i do that?
[01:06:19] <ghj> mmm, guess I have helped him by helping you help him by making him describe better his problem
[01:06:22] <martisj> i guess the quickest would be to hack the ui-corners :)
[01:06:28] <martisj> ghj: heheheheheh
[01:06:41] <martisj> help me help you help himself then help them and all the others
[01:06:44] <martisj> THANKS
[01:06:53] <ghj> so I've done my good action 0:-)
[01:07:09] <ghj> glad to help! :p
[01:10:44] <gnarf> martisj: what are you trying to change?
[01:10:56] <gnarf> martisj: also, is it important to change it in all dialogs? or just some?
[01:11:11] <martisj> gnarf: i don't want ui-corner-all just ui-corner-top-left and top-right
[01:11:17] <martisj> i'll just hack the css :)
[01:11:29] <martisj> non-elegant solution but good enough for me
[01:11:37] <gnarf> because you could .dialog().dialog("widget").toggleClass( "ui-corner-all ui-corner-top-left ui-corner-top-right" )
[01:12:11] <libryder> anyone know of a way to make jquery.ui.accordion slide DOWN instead of up? http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/ — if you scroll down and only make "Section 4" visible and click on it, its content slides up.
[01:12:34] <libryder> making the content unviewable
[01:12:40] <jedimind> if it scrolls down, the terrorists win
[01:13:02] <libryder> then maybe we should rethink our position on terrorism
[01:13:34] <jedimind> touche
[01:14:24] <libryder> it's probably too late to be coding and hoping for help
[01:14:34] <libryder> but the beer fuels me
[01:14:50] <jedimind> the beer fueled me too
[01:14:59] <jedimind> but the jagger shots
[01:15:01] <jedimind> and the bong hits
[01:15:05] <jedimind> negated that
[01:15:19] <libryder> lol
[01:15:36] <jedimind> also, i see no problem with the accordion
[01:16:38] <libryder> the issue is here: http://engineering.getg5.com/about-g5 the first one pushes the content down, which is congruent with reading from top-down. you get to "this is how we do it" and it scrolls everything you want to read UP
[01:16:55] <libryder> which means you have to scroll back up
[01:21:55] <gnarf> libryder: maybe accordion isn't the best UI element for a "long" bit of content - if you have to scroll to the link for the second one and the top of the first is offscreen - its probably a bad UI
[01:22:06] <ghj> IIRC there's a jquery (non-UI) method for sliding to an id. If that's correct, give an id to the header and then somehow scroll to that id the when the accordion expands the section
[01:22:57] <gnarf> but what ghj said is kind of true, there is a "scrollTo" plugin that you could use to scroll to the ID but its not going to play nice with your expectation of how the page should work
[01:23:34] <ghj> probably best to redesign the ui
[01:24:24] <ghj> e.g. see the 3-link pane at the right? on the left, you could have 3 panels on top of each other, and then smoothly make any of them appear when the link in the right pane is clicked
[01:25:18] <ghj> or even better, you'd not have 3 panels, but inline span-s which would make the text flow around the right pane
[01:25:35] <ghj> which would help to make the page less 'tall'
[01:25:47] <ghj> but that's a matter of your preference, of course
[01:25:49] <anli__> jsonp is dependent on cooperation with the server, right?
[01:25:53] <ghj> just shooting a few ideas
[01:26:11] <libryder> ok, so maybe keep the links on the right, and when you click, it scrolls the left pane while keeping the right pane in view?
[01:26:48] <libryder> i'm trying to avoid hard links to new pages
[01:27:11] <libryder> but one huge page also isn't favorable
[01:27:39] <libryder> ghj: i see you suggested that. nice :)
[01:28:45] <anli__> Seems like jsonp modifies the url I am sending to the server
[01:29:21] <ghj> jsonp is a string format, communication with the server might cause the problem
[01:29:36] <ghj> can you post a fiddle?
[01:30:27] <anli__> I?
[01:31:05] <ghj> http://jsfiddle.net/ an html+javascript code that reproduces your problem? so we have something concrete to work on
[01:31:24] <anli__> http://jsfiddle.net/dDs84/2/
[01:31:30] <ghj> thx
[01:31:40] <anli__> :)
[01:33:35] <anli__> Seems like I get a response, but it is an empty array
[01:44:42] <hoolter1> hi, i just came across a `typeof x` in some code.  how is that possible?  and why doens't that style of function call work for any function?
[01:45:38] <ravenzz> because it would be a mess
[01:45:56] <hoolter1> ravenzz but what lets it work for typeof?
[01:46:13] <ravenzz> Imagine something like this foo bar, lol, erg, 213
[01:46:52] <ghj> anli__: are you sure the success function is run at all?
[01:47:14] <ravenzz> hoolter1 I don't know actually, but that's a native function so..
[01:47:15] <hoolter1> ravenzz: ok, i hear u.
[01:47:26] <ghj> hoolterl: typeof is an operator, not a function, so it follows different rules
[01:47:29] <hoolter1> ravenzz: that's interesting...
[01:47:33] <ravenzz> operator
[01:47:34] <hoolter1> ghj: ahhh.
[01:47:34] <ravenzz> err
[01:47:35] <hoolter1> ok.
[01:47:44] <hoolter1> well that makes sense.
[01:48:20] <hoolter1> weird.  `typeof typeof` yields an error.
[01:48:52] <ravenzz> new new will do the same
[01:48:54] <ravenzz> and so on
[01:50:45] <anli__> ghj: yes, but I have given up on this, seems like I need an appid, and I only try to solve this to get some lousy points on stackoverflow
[01:50:53] <anli__> :)
[01:51:03] <anli__> Of course to learn about jsonp also
[01:51:13] <ghj> ...
[01:51:15] <anli__> Seems like its up to the server if jsonp will work
[01:51:15] <ghj> :)+
[01:51:27] <anli__> Is it a priest? :)
[01:51:40] <ghj> a typo
[01:51:48] <anli__> Ah, but it would surely be a nice priest
[01:52:23] <anli__> I dont understand how the browser will allow it on the other hand
[01:52:27] <ghj> After some time of research, I just put alert(); at the beginning of the function... and saw it is not run
[01:52:35] <anli__> Aha
[01:52:38] <ravenzz> lul
[01:52:42] <ghj> yea
[01:52:46] <ravenzz> ghj what are you trying to do?
[01:52:51] <ravenzz> I mean why bing :P
[01:52:57] <anli__> Why not
[01:53:05] <anli__> The question was placed with bing in mind
[01:53:11] <ghj> ravenzz  http://jsfiddle.net/dDs84/2/
[01:53:43] <anli__> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7618025/bing-phonebook-api-in-auto-complete
[01:53:46] <ravenzz> eh I don't know what is that api about
[01:54:05] <anli__> I dont do that either, but it gave some results back when I added query=test to the url
[01:55:06] <ghj> http://api.bing.com/osjson.aspx?callback=?query=test gives ["",[]]
[01:55:07] <ravenzz> oh wait ghj is the one who is helping
[01:55:37] <anli__> yeah, but without that callback stuff
[01:55:42] <ghj> yes, well, it's also to learn about ajax
[01:55:52] <ravenzz> http://api.bing.com/osjson.aspx?query=paul&callback=?
[01:56:04] <ravenzz> anli__ do you have a link to this api doc?
[01:56:09] <ravenzz> (reference)
[01:56:17] <ghj> why does the callback matter? it's done through GET thus I see the result
[01:56:19] <anli__> oh, not really
[01:56:22] <anli__> I am just playing
[01:56:42] <ravenzz> ghj it is required in order to do jsonp req
[01:56:46] <anli__> I dont know either, seems like jsonp is dependent on the callback query string variable to be passed
[01:56:50] <ghj> oh
[01:56:57] <sente> the callback doesn't seem to work though
[01:56:59] <anli__> It will be filled in with the name of a callback function that jquery automatically adds to the document
[01:57:17] <ghj> anli__: the code you fiddled generated this url http://api.bing.com/osjson.aspx?callback=?
[01:57:27] <anli__> oh
[01:57:32] <anli__> Does it?
[01:57:59] <ghj> doesn't it?
[01:58:23] <anli__> heh, must check
[01:58:30] <ghj> :p xD
[01:58:32] <sente> it doesn't
[01:59:11] <ravenzz> well if you don't know both ajax and the api it is hard to understand what's going on there
[01:59:18] <ravenzz> use an api you know at least
[01:59:24] <ghj> http://jsfiddle.net/MFxxz/
[01:59:35] <ghj> <--- stripped down
[02:00:28] <ghj> I don't know bing api syntax actually, so I don't even know whether it matters
[02:00:31] <sente> stripped to the point of not...useable
[02:00:46] <ghj> but I suppose that the double ? is doing something there
[02:01:00] <ravenzz> https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos?v=2&q=the%20italian%20who%20went%20to%20malta&safeSearch=none&alt=jsonc
[02:01:18] <ravenzz> play with that
[02:02:14] <anli__> It doesnt matter a lot as I already indicated
[02:02:52] <ghj> ok
[02:02:54] <anli__> ["test",[]] is returned from the server for me
[02:02:59] <anli__> Which is valid json
[02:03:07] <ravenzz> ok then
[02:03:14] <anli__> the function is not called, well, lets do something else
[02:03:15] <ravenzz> have you read the autocomplete guide?
[02:03:17] <ravenzz> (demmo)
[02:03:20] <anli__> yeah
[02:03:46] <anli__> They were chosing to describe the arguments instead of putting some example code on it
[02:04:01] <anli__> (the arguments to the callback function)
[02:04:49] <anli__> the interesting thing is, how can adding script tags to the document overcome the fact that you cannot access ajax cross browser?
[02:05:00] <anli__> oops
[02:05:02] <anli__> cross domain
[02:05:10] <anli__> lol
[02:05:46] <sente> http://jsfiddle.net/sente/9R94S/4/
[02:06:44] <sente> http://api.bing.com/osjson.aspx?query=test&JsonType=callback&JsonCallback=?
[02:07:12] <anli__> Same result with http://jsfiddle.net/9R94S/6/
[02:07:24] <anli__> @sente
[02:08:13] <sente> i'd hope you'd get the same result ;)
[02:18:09] <ravenzz> that one works
[02:29:32] <VectorX> can someone tell me whats wrong with this, http://jsfiddle.net/Sjzm4/1/ when you press the + button it should duplicate the Choose Image options, im guessing the second <input> tag without a name is causing the problem but cant seem to get it
[02:31:19] <ravenzz> the markup is confusing
[02:31:31] <ravenzz> what the choose image options are?
[02:32:17] <ravenzz> what are you trying to do
[02:32:18] <ravenzz> ?
[02:32:32] <VectorX> wait, html has gone wrong
[02:32:35] <VectorX> let me fix that
[02:34:54] <VectorX> http://jsfiddle.net/Sjzm4/2/
[02:35:17] <ravenzz> still a mess
[02:35:20] <VectorX> if you remove the second <input> tag the desired result is met, but i need that also to be there
[02:35:45] <ravenzz> shouldn't the button be a file input?
[02:36:00] <VectorX> ravenzz its called from another js
[02:36:28] <ravenzz> indent your markup first, make it semantic
[02:36:47] <ravenzz> separate the presentation (styles) from the markup
[02:37:07] <ravenzz> I can't understand what the hell it is supposed to do, tell me
[02:37:46] <VectorX> http://jsfiddle.net/Sjzm4/5/
[02:38:17] <VectorX> when you click the + link above choose image, that whole Choose Image Remove Image page should get duplicated, ie to add more images
[02:38:50] <VectorX> but the code breaks, if you take out the second <input> tag then the + sign will work and duplicate the Remove Image
[02:39:02] <VectorX> but then its missing the Choose Image button
[02:39:30] <ravenzz> the second input tag = the button?
[02:39:44] <VectorX> yes
[02:39:58] <ravenzz> <br clear="all"> this is crap btw :p
[02:40:01] <ravenzz> hold on
[02:40:44] <ravenzz> VectorX I am allowed to change the markup?
[02:41:00] <VectorX> so the problem mainly is coz the second input doesnt have a name attribute
[02:41:12] <VectorX> so how can i change the js to not mind that
[02:41:25] <VectorX> ie, Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'replace' of undefined
[02:41:47] <VectorX> ravenzz id rather a fix on the js part ;)
[02:43:11] <ravenzz> ok hold on
[02:45:16] <malinens> hi guys! how to attach jquery stuff (functions like parent(), find()) to an element. I have access to one element but jquery functions aren't attached to this element...
[02:49:32] <sahbeewah> wrap it with the jquery function
[02:49:38] <sahbeewah> $(element) ...
[02:55:59] <malinens> sahbeewah: thanks!
[03:05:53] <sunbeam> i'd like to check whether an input is MM/DD/YYYY format
[03:05:58] <sunbeam> any idea how i can do this best?
[03:06:06] <VectorX> ravenzz how we looking
[03:08:22] <libryder> ghj: still there?
[03:08:32] <ghj> ?
[03:08:59] <ghj> yes, tell me
[03:09:17] <libryder> waiting for assets to compile… i'm going to show you the fruition of your suggestion
[03:09:35] <libryder> (if it works on the first deploy :D )
[03:10:07] <ghj> huh, exciting
[03:10:08] <libryder> launching...
[03:10:20] <ghj> *run-time error*
[03:10:22] <ghj> :p
[03:10:28] <libryder> http://engineering.getg5.com/about-g5
[03:10:41] <libryder> getting closer
[03:10:53] <ghj> cool
[03:11:04] <libryder> need to make the floating nav a little prettier
[03:11:11] <libryder> but basically, was that what you were thinking?
[03:11:24] <ghj> also nice the right pane that follows the top of the viewport
[03:11:43] <ghj> I actually was thinking about layered panes which faded in/out like slides
[03:11:50] <ghj> but this is *cool*
[03:11:55] <libryder> ahhhhhh
[03:12:02] <libryder> that's a good idea too
[03:12:41] <ghj> The nav takes a while to reach the top of the viewport, could it be faster?
[03:12:55] <libryder> that's something i'd like to fix
[03:13:54] <libryder> i originally updating real-time as you scroll, but chrome handled it horribly. looked great in firefox and IE is banned
[03:14:28] <libryder> after i get comfortable with this change, i'm going to create an IE splash page that prevents viewing
[03:14:36] <ravenzz> VectorX I am  back sorry, I was a bit busy... http://jsfiddle.net/kNeAn/
[03:14:58] <libryder> "You were fired before you even got hired. Congratulations on such a feat."
[03:15:08] <libryder> *BING*
[03:15:23] <ghj> why fired?
[03:16:31] <libryder> i'm thinking of messages to display on the IE splash page
[03:17:03] <libryder> maybe i should make the IE splash page a full-screen image of BSOD
[03:17:33] <VectorX> ravenzz dude you were not supposed to change the html, the choose button was there to bring up the wordpress media uploader :)
[03:17:36] <ghj> really that company will allow you to?
[03:18:16] <ravenzz> VectorX can't you adapt it so the wp media uploader will pop up?
[03:18:27] <ravenzz> I am pretty sure you can
[03:18:28] <libryder> ghj: it's kind of a recruiting site, because we need engineers, and we all agree that if someone finds us via IE, they are probably a bad fit
[03:18:29] <ghj> I mean, if you're working for them, will they expect cross-browser html?
[03:18:38] <ghj> oh
[03:18:45] <ghj> then you're right
[03:18:49] <libryder> so we want to make it humorous :)
[03:19:06] <ghj> then you could have put the splash even if it worked in IE :p
[03:19:13] <libryder> yep!
[03:19:36] <VectorX> ravenzz its basically a mashup between, Image and Repeatable Fields from here http://bit.ly/zP31eu
[03:20:49] <VectorX> ravenzz you sort of went all out on that in a different direction, i kind of feel bad for the effort
[03:21:14] <libryder> well, ghj, thanks for the help. you've given me a lot to think about and really helped me rethink some things
[03:21:21] <ghj> vectorx: what was the problem with the fiddle?
[03:21:27] <VectorX> i could have just added a name=something, to the second input and it works, but i wanted to tweak the JS to ignore that
[03:21:43] <libryder> night humans
[03:21:46] <VectorX> http://jsfiddle.net/Sjzm4/5/
[03:21:58] <ghj> thanks are due to gnarf too, he suggested to rethink the ui at first
[03:22:07] <ghj> night libryder
[03:23:49] <libryder> just checked my logs; indeed, thanks gnarf for starting the conversation
[03:23:58] <libryder> bye
[03:24:49] <ghj> venomx: what error do you get in the console when you click the button?
[03:26:17] <VectorX> ghj if you take out the second <input> tag and press the + it shows the desired result
[03:26:29] <VectorX> it doesnt work coz that tag doesnt have a name attribute
[03:26:54] <VectorX> so if the js can ignore that issue and continue that would work
[03:27:15] <ghj> again: what error do you get in the console when you click the button?
[03:27:27] <Es0teric> i got a question - how do i hide an element without fade?
[03:27:34] <VectorX> [15:11] <VectorX> ie, Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'replace' of undefined
[03:28:03] <ghj> es0teric: .css( { visibility: 'hidden' } ) http://api.jquery.com/css/
[03:28:11] <ghj> or display: 'none', whichever suits well for u
[03:28:38] <ghj> vectorx: so name is undefined. why do u think it is undefined?
[03:29:28] <VectorX> ghj sorry dude, i get you, i know why the error is there, i already explains it like an hour ago
[03:29:41] <ghj> right, now how would you say 'if name is undefined, then do nothing, else do name.replace'
[03:29:44] <ghj> ?
[03:29:48] <ghj> in javascript of course
[03:30:06] <VectorX> probably put a try catch
[03:30:43] <ghj> I'd do this way
[03:30:52] <ghj> if(name == undefined) return undefined; else return name.replace .....
[03:33:01] <VectorX> ghj so its at a basic js level then, i was trying to find a jQuery specific method to get around it
[03:33:25] <VectorX> guess that was complicating things
[03:33:31] <marandi> hi guys , how can i find if this string "asfgdsgsadasdasD_" has '_'  or not ?!
[03:33:48] <ghj> I'd rather say: it was about getting undefined when a name is not set
[03:34:09] <hoolter> what does $('#an_empty_textarea').val() return?
[03:34:21] <VectorX> ghj ok well, thanks ill go with that
[03:34:30] <ghj> vectorx: glad to help!
[03:34:41] <marandi> hi guys , how can i find if this string "asfgdsgsadasdasD_" has '_'  or not ?!
[03:34:54] <VectorX> but guess you didnt see that try catch coming did you, ;)
[03:35:09] <VectorX> ravenzz thanks for the assist man
[03:36:06] <ghj> for the luck of my health, I didn't :p
[03:36:16] <ghj> marandi: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=string+contains+character+javascript
[03:36:17] <VectorX> good one
[03:36:22] <VectorX> havent seen that before
[03:36:48] <hoolter> ghj: i think you meant lmddgtfy.com
[03:37:34] <ghj> hoolter: unfortunately there's nolmsitbify.com
[03:37:40] <ghj> there's no *
[03:38:00] <sunbeam> $.post("test.php", $("#testform").serialize());
[03:38:04] <sunbeam> is this a good way of sending a form?
[03:38:11] <ghj> let me see in the browser inspector for you :o
[03:38:18] <sunbeam> sending/submitting
[03:39:00] <ghj> sunbeam: submit()? http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[03:39:09] <sunbeam> ghj: yes, submit is better or
[03:40:58] <sunbeam> in other words, whats wrong with post
[03:46:47] <ghj> if it works for you, nothing
[03:47:11] <ghj> but I personally think that a plain submit() it's way easier to read, understand, and maintain
[03:48:21] <sunbeam> ok
[03:55:36] <vl1234> Percentage validation for input field....for ever key up can be validate using regex
[03:56:13] <vl1234> if any have idea about this ........please let's share with me
[03:58:49] <FernandoBasso> I have three email input fields. Can I somehow send an ajax request everytime a blur event occurs in any of them, without have to do something like $('#email1').blur(..., $('#email2').blur(..., $('#email3').blur(.. ?
[04:00:00] <ghj> v11234: seems fine, as long as you remember that it does not replace server-side validation. Do you have some code for us to test?
[04:00:28] <ghj> fernandobasso: "#email1, #email2, #email3"
[04:00:38] <FernandoBasso> Wonderful!
[04:01:21] <ghj> Also, do not stick to the blur( function() {  ... code ... } ) style. Remember that you can assign a function like blurFunction = function() { ... } and then invoke blur( blurFunction )
[04:02:10] <FernandoBasso> Sure. Thanks for the hint.
[04:02:12] <vl1234> @ghj.....i dont have complete idea about  regular expression.....that y asking
[04:03:06] <ghj> v11234: [0-9] checks for a digit, % stands for itself. Two digits followed by a % gives /[0-9][0-9]%/
[04:19:43] <ohcibi> is it possible to drag draggables by javascript?
[04:24:38] <parabellum> hell how to use $("select#elem").val(''); but with $this
[04:25:53] <ghj> ohcibi: here is the documentation: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/   see the tabs at the bottom
[04:26:07] <ghj> in the 'methods' tab, there's no method for moving the draggable
[04:26:22] <ghj> there's one for setting an option, but in the 'options' tab I see no option for changing the draggable position
[04:27:02] <ghj> However, in the Overview tab, there's an advice: you could add the draggable into a div positioned with abosiolute positioning.
[04:27:31] <ghj> (if I read it correctly.) The containing div can then be moved with jQuery .css()
[04:27:50] <ghj> or .animate() http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[04:28:01] <ghj> parabellum: $(this)
[04:29:36] <ohcibi> ghj: hm i thought maybe there is a solution beyond stock draggable 8-)).. anyway i needed it to test a script that uses sortables, i now just reorder the hierarchy by hand and trigger sortstop manually
[04:30:50] <pandu101> hey guys - in jquery ajax, is it okay to send an ajax request without data? I'm sending the data via the url instead of the std. data field. I tried it, there is no error but its also not doing what I expect it to.
[04:42:20] <hoolter> how can i select a select element with only one child option element?
[04:51:43] <ghj> hoolter: not sure if that works:     $("select > option:first-child:last-child")
[04:51:43] <ghj> http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/
[04:54:15] <ghj> mmm sorry
[04:54:46] <ghj> better version: "select > option:first-of-type:last-of-type"
[04:55:43] <Haprog> that would select the option istead of the parent select though. you would need to get the parent from that
[04:56:03] <ghj> then call .parent()
[04:56:17] <ghj> http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[04:56:25] <Haprog> yep
[04:59:17] <ghj> yes, thx for pointing out
[05:04:53] <subdesign> hi
[05:05:34] <subdesign> i use googlemap api, and has an error ReferenceError: onLoadmap is not defined. Checking the source code, onLoadmap function is there. So ?
[05:14:29] <FernandoBasso> How can I get the previous sibling which is an input type text element?
[05:15:33] <FernandoBasso> $($(this).prev('input[type=text]').val());
[05:15:45] <FernandoBasso> Something similar to this, perhaps?
[05:36:01] <FernandoBasso> I am at the id='tf13'. How to get the value of the element id='tf12 starting from id='tf13'? I have tried something like: $('#tf13').parent().parent().prev(':last').val(); ... but it is not quite working.
[05:36:05] <FernandoBasso> https://gist.github.com/3165063
[05:36:20] <FernandoBasso> The html document in question.
[05:37:17] <Haprog> FernandoBasso: if you know the id is tf12 just do $('#tf12')[0].val()
[05:37:51] <trailbar> howdy ,looking to use jQuery templates - as this is not apparently going past beta is this a good idea (are there recommended alternatives?)
[05:37:56] <FernandoBasso> I have to only check for the other values when #tf13 blurs.
[05:38:11] <FernandoBasso> And the values will be dynamic.
[05:38:21] <FernandoBasso> I mean, the id's.
[05:38:25] <Haprog> trailbar: I'd recommend looking into mustache.js, handlebars.js and underscore.js
[05:39:34] <FernandoBasso> Haprog: I'll send the value of the 'tf12' by ajax, but only when tf13 blurs. There are other elements that's have their values sent with ajax.
[05:40:40] <FernandoBasso> Oh, I think the most important is that I'll use $(this) instead of #tf13, and the other elements I want to match will always be the same "distance" from $(this).
[05:41:07] <FernandoBasso> $($(this)).parent().parent().prev(':last').val(); <-- The code would be something like it.
[05:41:28] <FernandoBasso> That is why I can't just use #tf12.
[05:41:46] <Haprog> maybe you want something like $('#tf13').closest('tr').prev().find('input[type=text]').val() ?
[05:41:58] <Haprog> why the double $($())?
[05:42:02] <Haprog> that does nothing
[05:42:23] <FernandoBasso> A mistake, I agree. Thanks for calling it to my attention.
[05:43:04] <trailbar> Haprog: thanks, will take a look
[05:44:01] <FernandoBasso> Haprog: Works. I'll also need to go further back one more step, and also find #tf11.
[05:44:21] <FernandoBasso> You see, from tf13, I have to find tf12 and tf11.
[05:45:02] <Haprog> just do one more prev() then
[05:50:30] <FernandoBasso> Console just returns 'Object []'.
[05:52:14] <FernandoBasso> It works, I was doing it wrong.
[05:52:20] <FernandoBasso> Thanks a bunch for your time.
[05:52:22] <FernandoBasso> and help!
[06:00:39] <Haprog> np
[06:02:43] <RobJE_> newbie question: 1 have div with autocomplete form and a div where i want to display results for selected or updated data. how to do this?
[06:05:44] <prateekp> hello
[06:06:52] <M1k1> guys
[06:07:13] <M1k1> the fadein effect set in sec looks like 5000 why too speed?
[06:08:50] <prateekp_> https://gist.github.com/3193282
[06:08:55] <prateekp_> this is my coe
[06:08:57] <prateekp_> code
[06:09:14] <prateekp_> in this code there are many show and hide buttons
[06:09:43] <prateekp_> but only one show and hide button works, what should i do to make all of them working
[06:11:59] <FernandoBasso> RobJE_: What do you mean by 'display'?
[06:12:19] <FernandoBasso> Perhaps $('#results_div').html(results) ?
[06:15:46] <rty> huh... it's being more and more difficult to pass the captcha
[06:15:48] <rty> :-/
[06:16:02] <prateekp_> jquery.each() is used for ???
[06:17:43] <rty> prateekp_: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[06:21:31] <M1k1> in the jquery 1.7.2 display normal this $(".slide").css("display", "none").fadeIn(8000); and the 1.8 rc1 too fast why?
[06:24:44] <RobJE_> FernandoBasso: get the (sjon?)data and fill the <div>
[06:25:55] <yarekt1> Hi all. I'm trying to stop an overflown div from scrolling. Disabling everything (including scroll event on the window) doesn't disable scrolling when you drag the mouse to the bottom of the screen, say
[06:26:44] <FernandoBasso> I did exactly this some days ago... I don't have the code here now, but it was something like: var result = jQuery.parseJSON(return_data); $('#results_div1').html(result.foo); $('#results_div2').html(results.bar);
[06:27:29] <RobJE_> FernandoBasso: return data does not contain json. json data is on separate url
[06:27:30] <FernandoBasso> With php I used something like: echo json_encode(array('foo' => $var1, 'bar' => $var2));
[06:27:39] <FernandoBasso> Oh...
[06:28:22] <FernandoBasso> What about .load('url/to/file/')?
[06:30:59] <prateekp_> suppose i form buttons with same id with the help of loop , how can i access all the buttons
[06:31:02] <RobJE_> FernandoBasso: and present html data on url.
[06:31:17] <prateekp_> lets say id = "shwr"
[06:32:01] <RobJE_> FernandoBasso: I'll give it a try, THNX
[06:32:56] <FernandoBasso> RobJE_: I'm not an expert. I just gave the first try myself some days ago. It worked, but it took me a long time to understand the basics of how it works. :)
[06:33:57] <prateekp_> suppose there are lots of <tr> tags .... how can i access each of them to write jquery script for them
[06:34:00] <prateekp_> ??
[06:34:11] <defaultro> I'm watching a jquery tutorial in youtube. He wrote var count = $('*').length; to display the count of all elements. Then he changed it to var count = $('#area').find('*').length; Why did he add .find? What will happen if he wrote it like this, var count = $('#area').length;
[06:34:56] <yarekt1> defaultro: $('#area') will be a list of all elements with id='area' (which should be one)
[06:35:16] <defaultro> i'm aware of that part, it's a div
[06:35:24] <defaultro> i was wondering why he added .find function
[06:35:25] <yarekt1> defaultro: $('#area').find('*') finds all elements below #area
[06:35:29] <defaultro> yes
[06:35:37] <defaultro> what happens if he remove find?
[06:35:44] <yarekt1> defaultro: i guess you could do $('#area *') too
[06:36:05] <defaultro> $('#area').length
[06:36:10] <defaultro> what about that?
[06:36:13] <yarekt1> defaultro: you'd only get one element (the one with id='area')
[06:36:47] <defaultro> oh, it's not going to flow down?
[06:36:55] <yarekt1> defaultro: what do you mean?
[06:37:07] <yarekt1> $() matches elements by a selector
[06:37:11] <yarekt1> just like css
[06:37:25] <defaultro> inside his div id="area" are 3 more elements
[06:37:47] <defaultro> k
[06:37:52] <yarekt1> #area would match all elements with id area, '#area > li' would match all 'li' elements that are children of #area
[06:38:01] <RobJE_> FernandoBasso: Same here. jquery takes time
[06:38:04] <M1k1> how can include in jquery to load another script .js file?
[06:38:21] <yarekt1> defaultro: '#area a' would match all anchors that are contained anywhere within #area
[06:38:26] <defaultro> i got it now
[06:38:56] <M1k1> anyone?
[06:39:50] <zulu-gula> I'm looking for plugin that will move (position: left) background div depend on cursor position
[06:39:53] <defaultro> M1k1, just add it in html
[06:39:58] <defaultro> just like how you call your jquery
[06:40:03] <defaultro> another src
[06:41:05] <M1k1> defaultro: in jquery not have method do this?
[06:41:35] <defaultro> i don't know but i woulndn't change jquery.js
[06:41:52] <defaultro> most codes i've seen do it the way I said above
[06:43:53] <defaultro> hey guys, I need to troubleshoot a webapp that was given to us last week. It's on my localhost. It uses postgres. Postgres is working fine. However, one of the .js is spitting out "Email address is not allowed." I found that js. However, I can't trace what's going on
[06:44:38] <defaultro> I've been asking the guy to help me and he promised me for 3 days now, he'll come over but never did
[06:45:50] <defaultro> i've firebug open but can't find where to put the breakpoint. Once I step each line, in few more steps, I'll get that dreaded "Email address is not allowed" after I logged in. I automatically get logged out
[06:46:09] <defaultro> I was thinking, it might be checking an email address in postgres
[06:46:45] <rty> m1k1: .add('<script>')

[07:01:46] <yarekt1> foucist: isn't it just focus() ?
[07:02:24] <xmaddness> old school js hurts my eyes any more
[07:03:20] <foucist> xmaddness: true, i've forgotten what the new school way is and i'm kind of just hacking stuff together
[07:03:35] <MichMich_> foucist: the best way ... ;)
[07:04:02] <xmaddness> foucist: I would write a jquery to handle it
[07:04:09] <foucist> i probably should be specifying the focus on by input id and on body load or something?
[07:04:22] <xmaddness> foucist: set something simple up on jsfiddle.net and I'll have a look
[07:04:35] <xmaddness> just fill in the html
[07:05:04] <xmaddness> foucist: I assume (since you are asking in jquery) that you are using jquery/
[07:05:27] <Noeble> question: Iam trying to make a simple dropdown and I want my dropdown( div ) to be below the tab, and the dropdown divs right side should be at the tabs right side in position.. however I cant get this to work
[07:05:37] <Noeble> paste: http://pastebin.com/wZYgPtsT
[07:06:19] <Noeble> anyone have a tip whats wrong?
[07:06:58] <Noeble> atm the dropdown div places itself correctly below the tab, but to the left side of it instead of the right
[07:08:05] <foucist> xmaddness: oh cool, using autofocus="autofocus"  does the trick.. no js needed i guess
[07:08:26] <xmaddness> kk
[07:08:47] <xmaddness> may want to check that in ie8 though
[07:08:53] <xmaddness> if that is a concern for you
[07:08:53] <foucist> or i guess i could've used something like $('input').focus();​
[07:35:45] <prateekp> https://gist.github.com/3193619 ... this is my code ... please check my syntax 41-50 line
[07:38:38] <sahbeewah> move your script out of the loop and out of the table
[07:40:25] <sahbeewah> also that loop creates multiple elements of the same id which you shouldn't do
[07:42:58] <prateekp> https://gist.github.com/3193619 ... this is my code ... please check my syntax 41-50 line
[07:48:15] <rty> prateekp: no syntax error
[07:50:45] <prateekp> $("#hidr").eq(index) .... is this allowed
[07:51:03] <rty> yes
[07:55:05] <prateekp> $("#hidr").eq(2) .... what would this give
[08:07:47] <ge2x> Hey people! I have page which has a bunch of content loaded into it with the .load() method. I need to access that .load()ed contant with .each(). How do I do that?
[08:08:57] <thomedy> what version of jquery are you running
[08:09:05] <thomedy> ge2x
[08:09:08] <ge2x> 1.7.2
[08:09:16] <thomedy> okay then your going to want to check out .on
[08:09:37] <thomedy> and then your .bind will be for all elements now and later
[08:09:56] <thomedy> other wise you can check out live or delegate for predecated versions of jquery
[08:10:01] <thomedy> but that should help
[08:10:18] <thomedy>  i dont know how to call the bot here to give you the page in jquery.com
[08:10:25] <thomedy> but that should get you on the way
[08:10:36] <Brodingo> ?on
[08:10:37] <thomedy> whoa... i dont suck anymore
[08:10:39] <ge2x> I'm checking that ou right now. Thanks!
[08:10:49] <thomedy> yay
[08:10:52] <Brodingo> hes not here :(
[08:11:45] <Brodingo> also, load has a hollerback function you can pass as the second arg
[08:12:00] <Brodingo> incase youre not just wanting event delegation
[08:12:03] <thomedy> oh im totally calling it that from now on
[08:12:23] <thomedy> you just gave js street cred
[08:12:28] <thomedy> what up
[08:13:32] <Brodingo> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[08:14:18] <ge2x> the thing is that I want to open a .dialog when a <a> with a specific class gets clicked. I'm doing that with .on() and it works for the parent page, but not for the content loaded into it with .load()
[08:14:59] <ge2x> I would like wo have that content loaded with .load be treated as if it was the content of the parent page
[08:15:19] <Brodingo> parent page? are you using an iframe?
[08:16:01] <ge2x> nope
[08:16:12] <ge2x> I'm loading content into <div>s
[08:16:50] <ge2x> and the content loaded with .load() or .get() is not parsed through the .each that the rest of the page is parsed through
[08:17:05] <Brodingo> aight
[08:22:26] <ge2x> thomedy: what event should I watch for with .on()?
[08:23:38] <rty> ge2x: could you please post a fiddle?
[08:23:42] <kkoala> I need to append dynamic <span>s with a space after them, so they don't overflow their fixed-width container. Is there a better way than var $new = $('<span>'); $container.append($new + ' '); ?
[08:24:06] <rty> the smallest code that reproduces your problem? thanks
[08:25:05] <rty> kkoala: overflow:hidden on the containter? display:inline-block on the span?
[08:25:26] <rty> just ideas though
[08:25:58] <rty> the space looks like a hack that shouldn't be there
[08:26:13] <ge2x> http://jsfiddle.net/YXDKf/
[08:26:22] <kkoala> rty: overflow:hidden just hides them, and they have display:inline by default. Without the spaces, they're one long word, so to speak, and don#t wrap.
[08:27:24] <rty> ah, in which case it seems no hack
[08:27:44] <rty> maybe    $('<span> ')   ?
[08:28:21] <Brodingo> this sounds pretty dumb
[08:29:00] <kkoala> rty: I tried that, the space seems to be discarded. The method I mentioned works, just wondering if there's a cleaner way
[08:29:36] <Brodingo> seems like something that should be solved with css
[08:29:49] <Brodingo> white-space: nowrap ?
[08:30:04] <hoolter1> Hi... How can I subtract an attribute from a selected element?
[08:30:14] <Brodingo> .removeAttr()
[08:31:20] <hoolter1> Brodingo: sweet, thanks. :)
[08:31:29] <Brodingo> yay!
[08:33:26] <kkoala> Brodingo: thanks but doesn't work either. AFAIK this is expected behaviour, the solution is to add whitespace between the elements. generated source looks like <span>Foo</span><span>Foo</span><span>Foo</span><span>Foo</span> ...
[08:33:55] <rty> http://jsfiddle.net/YXDKf/
[08:34:22] <rty> agree, that's why I said it seems no hack...
[08:34:25] <Brodingo> still not really sure what youre trying to do
[08:35:35] <rty> kkoala: http://jsfiddle.net/DeUaQ/
[08:37:13] <Brodingo> lol why are you using functions there rty
[08:37:36] <rty> that sounds pretty ingenuous
[08:37:42] <rty> the goal is to add whitespace
[08:37:59] <rty> I hoped to pass it as html, $("<span> ")
[08:38:11] <rty> but instead jquery ignores it
[08:38:18] <ajpiano> call me crazy but wouldn't span { display: inline-block; margin-right: 1em; } do the trick here
[08:38:19] <rty> so I will go the other way around
[08:38:27] <rty> do not wrap into $ but directly return the string
[08:38:30] <kkoala> rty: The result is what I need, thanks. Will work off this.
[08:38:40] <Brodingo> kkoala please dont
[08:38:48] <ajpiano> white spaces are not a positioning tool
[08:38:49] <kkoala> no?
[08:39:08] <ajpiano> nope
[08:39:20] <ajpiano> i mean, when i was making websites in frontpage '98
[08:39:21] <ajpiano> sure
[08:39:31] <ajpiano> slap a few &nbsp's in there and call it a day
[08:39:58] <kkoala> sure, I could float them and all that jazz but a plain space after each span is all i really need here
[08:40:04] <ajpiano> but i'm pretty sure you should be handling the styling of your spans and whether they have whitespace around them with CSS, not the string " "
[08:40:05] <rty> kkoala: you have words inside those spans?
[08:40:10] <rty> or what else?
[08:40:38] <ajpiano> kkoala: if you build up the entire HTML string it might have more hope for you
[08:40:50] <trailbar> i'm obtaining raw html code (actually svg) from an ajax request -- whats the easiest way to convert this to a dom element to inject into my document?
[08:41:01] <kkoala> yep, something resembling a tag list. they're populated and inserted via a click handler and ajax
[08:41:32] <knickabocka> perhaps someone can help me here: http://jsfiddle.net/karlradikarl/k84XR/ i try to imitate the left div in a css way without using a png. i dont know if its possible to fade this opacity.
[08:41:36] <rty> So we've got some textual content.
[08:42:15] <Brodingo> a linear gradient should do the trick knickabocka
[08:42:16] <rty> If the user gets rid of the css, say, because of a screen reader or because it overrides your css, he'll lose the margin trick.
[08:42:20] <Brodingo> check out css3please.com
[08:42:24] <rty> and will see a single, long word.
[08:42:27] <kkoala> Gotta take a quick break, I'll post a simplified fiddle
[08:42:44] <ajpiano> rty:  this does the trick http://jsfiddle.net/DeUaQ/2/
[08:42:46] <ajpiano> cc kkoala
[08:43:09] <ajpiano> in general it's also better, because this way you only have to touch the DOM once, instead of making multiple appends
[08:43:27] <rty> ajpiano, very good result
[08:43:37] <knickabocka> linear gardient?
[08:43:52] * Brodingo _o/\o_ ajpiano
[08:44:02] <Brodingo> lol
[08:44:07] <Brodingo> gardient
[08:44:23] <knickabocka> do they have a tutorial at css3please.com?
[08:44:40] <thomedy> i have a pretty big load time
[08:44:44] <Brodingo> knickabocka its the third rule down
[08:44:53] <knickabocka> k
[08:44:54] <thomedy> i would like to preload scripts and what not
[08:44:58] <Brodingo> just swap out the hex colors for rgba or hsla
[08:45:11] <ajpiano> knickabocka: opera has some good docs on understanding css gradients
[08:45:14] <ajpiano> knickabocka: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/css3-linear-gradients/
[08:45:20] <ajpiano> if that's what you're looking for
[08:45:26] <ajpiano> http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/css3-radial-gradients/
[08:45:35] <Brodingo> sweet
[08:45:47] <Brodingo> quite thorough
[08:45:49] <knickabocka> thx
[08:46:00] <knickabocka> i will take a look
[08:47:05] <knickabocka> is the iphone also using css3
[08:47:12] <knickabocka> ?
[08:47:19] <thomedy> okay here is what im thinking
[08:47:30] <ge2x> hey, if async: false in .ajax() is going to be deprecated in version 1.8, how are synchronous reguests supposed to be made?
[08:47:33] <hoolter1> anyone know if Zepto supports $('#multiple, #selectors')?
[08:47:39] <thomedy> i have most my files in straight js... but i already wrote some of it in jqeury and didn't want to rewrite it
[08:47:41] <ajpiano> ge2x: it isn't going to be deprecated
[08:47:45] <thomedy> cuz it worksw
[08:47:49] <ajpiano> ge2x: i know it's marked that way in the docs
[08:47:49] <Brodingo> knickabocka yep
[08:47:58] <thomedy> now ive got a tremendous load time
[08:48:06] <ajpiano> but we're actually just deprecating the ability to use the promise API of ajax with async: false
[08:48:28] <thomedy> part of it is the amount of work im making js do and i would imagine thats the bulk of it
[08:48:38] <thomedy> my ideas are this
[08:48:46] <thomedy> preload the scripts
[08:48:51] <ajpiano> ge2x: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12122
[08:48:56] <thomedy> or drop the jquery
[08:48:59] <ajpiano> ge2x: in general it's still better to try and avoid sync requests
[08:49:01] <Tiberio> Hi, Is there a method like .closest() that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing down through the DOM tree.
[08:49:08] <thomedy> and rebuild that 2nd part  in straight js
[08:49:10] <ajpiano> thomedy: you should profile your code
[08:49:16] <ajpiano> and use tools like yslow and zoompf
[08:49:25] <ajpiano> because chances are a tiny smattering of jquery is not why your load time is bad
[08:49:30] <thomedy> okay cool
[08:49:38] <thomedy> let me google yslow and zoompf
[08:49:41] <thomedy> i have never heard of them
[08:50:23] <ajpiano> hoolter1: it does
[08:50:26] <ajpiano> i didn't know that before
[08:50:37] <thomedy> okay question
[08:50:41] <ajpiano> but i did this crazy thing where i went to zeptojs.com and typed $("div, span") into the console
[08:50:42] <thomedy> i just ran du -h on it
[08:50:49] <thomedy> and got 16 k for my main file
[08:51:04] <thomedy> that matters less of text size then it does for functionality correct?
[08:51:17] <ajpiano> um
[08:51:25] <Tiberio> Hi, Is there a method like .closest() that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing down through the DOM tree.
[08:51:38] <ajpiano> i have never heard of anyone using du as a tool for front-end website performance
[08:51:46] <thomedy> im still new
[08:51:52] <thomedy> so i thougth checking file size might help
[08:51:54] <ajpiano> Tiberio: .find() does that, but it doesn't stop at the first match in the same way that closest does
[08:52:18] <ajpiano> thomedy: file size alone is a completley useless metric, imo
[08:52:26] <ajpiano> thomedy: while( true ) {} is a tiny amount of code
[08:52:27] <thomedy> i figured
[08:52:30] <ajpiano> but it still will freeze your website
[08:52:30] <ajpiano> so
[08:52:36] <thomedy> yeah duh > me
[08:53:01] <ajpiano> thomedy: http://engineering.spanishdict.com/2012/03/12/front-end-profiling-and-optimization.html

[08:53:50] <vl1234> hi hi
[08:53:59] <vl1234> i have a big doubt
[08:54:15] <vl1234> i have input text field with val
[08:55:08] <vl1234> i want to hide the that input field val but not hidden that input field.......its possible
[08:55:11] <vl1234> in jquery
[08:55:16] <ge2x> so, as I understand, I can still call .ajax with async: false?
[08:55:30] <ge2x> or is there a better way to do sync requests?
[08:55:46] <rty> v11234: looking for a password field?
[08:55:48] <thomedy> okay  i have yslow
[08:55:54] <thomedy> and what was that other one
[08:56:14] <vl1234> ya ya..........even not show the dot also
[08:56:21] <vl1234> to user
[08:56:37] <vl1234> @rty...........Ar u got
[08:56:58] <ajpiano> thomedy: learn to scroll up in irc
[08:57:39] <rty> v11234: <input type password>, please do not set up graphical hacks that have no correspondence in the semantics of the doucment
[08:57:50] <rty> <input type=password> sorry
[08:58:10] <vl1234> @rty...........it ill show dot
[08:58:51] <vl1234> @rty...........even dot also not shown
[08:58:57] <thomedy> i knew someone was going to say that
[08:59:04] <thomedy> i had to restart the browser to apply the
[08:59:06] <thomedy> yslow
[08:59:19] <thomedy> or i would have
[08:59:22] <ajpiano> thomedy: http://zoompf.com/
[09:00:32] <vl1234> @rty...........hey'
[09:01:23] <rty> v11234: maybe have the password field transparent and a div positioned over it?
[09:02:50] <thomedy> omg zoompf is awesome
[09:02:58] <thomedy> step one http compression
[09:03:00] <thomedy> cool
[09:03:08] <thomedy> not sur ehow to do taht but here we go
[09:03:48] <kkoala> rty, Brodingo, ajpiano: See here: http://jsfiddle.net/uFcNG/
[09:04:30] <hoolter1> ajpiano: cook, thx.
[09:05:18] <Brodingo> cool
[09:05:42] <AnonymousPrime> if i've got a query ui sortable, but also want to have the sortable draggables be able to be dragged to an unrelated droppable to delete the item, how do i cancel the sortable stop action when dropped on the delete dropptable?
[09:05:48] <Brodingo> i love random numbers
[09:06:06] <AnonymousPrime> ev.stopPropagation didn't get it
[09:06:40] <AnonymousPrime> think sortables stop must fire before the other droppables drop
[09:09:17] <rty> sorry v11234, after all it just needs to work at the end of the day, you can use with <div contenteditable=true><span style="color:#fff"></span></div>
[09:10:55] <AnonymousPrime> found it. $('#sortable').sortable('cancel'); in my other droppables drop event
[09:11:14] <rty> as a replacement for password input
[09:15:12] <vl1234> @rty...........am not get
[09:16:30] <rty> well it does the trick you want, doesn't it?
[09:18:09] <hoolter> Anyone know of a nice lightweight standalone microlib that'll let me automatically scroll to a specific anchor but not just abruptly jump there and animate the scrolling process?

[09:19:41] <vl1234> may be
[09:19:51] <vl1234> u r corrent.......ill tink
[09:20:45] <rty> the user does not see the text, so it's secure, and you asked for the password points not to appear
[09:22:38] <ld16> hey, I'm trying to display tooltips on every anchor tag on a button press.  I'm trying to load up jquery.tipsy.js, and then use it but I get this error

[09:41:52] <shadykhan> im ajaxing my pages in so theres no need to refresh. But when i click on the page it takes #content div and puts it in another #content div. How can i prevent this from happening? my code http://pastebin.com/5uCrjXgP
[09:42:29] <thomedy> im trying to teach my self how to mod_deflate or gzip my files for compression
[09:43:01] <thomedy> i dont see any examples that have anything in the .php or .html themselves jus tin the .htaccess thing
[09:43:08] <thomedy> how do i know it worked
[09:44:43] <kkoala> thomedy: look at the http header and compare the sent file size with the uncompressed size
[09:45:17] <thomedy> oh wait in firebug right
[09:45:29] <kkoala> for example
[09:46:01] <thomedy> okay i think  i got that
[09:46:10] <thomedy> it still seems pretty slow

[10:03:08] <RohanBhangui> any ideas?
[10:03:35] <brergq> Hello :)
[10:04:06] <brergq> I have a question, let me get the prereq together...
[10:05:45] <brergq> If I want to allow the user to visit a page, and start enterring data I suppose http://api.jquery.com/keypress/ would be my best bet.
[10:06:16] <brergq> $(document).click(function() {});  seems to be correct, as everything ends up bubbling down to this, right?
[10:06:56] <brergq> So then, if all said is correct, and I want to capture each key, and evaluate it, (e.which seems tedious) how would I do so?
[10:07:51] <brergq> I want to allow only numerals, captured from the numeral pad, so just an if/else withj e.which?
[10:23:01] <Transcended> Hello.  I was wondering, is there a way to detect a loaded iFrame through jquery for an iframe that is included with dynamically loaded content?  I noticed the docs mention delegate and live can't be used.
[10:28:24] <brergq> O.IK
[10:28:37] <brergq> I asked stupid question,in stupid way.
[10:28:40] <brergq> Here is some code for an example: http://jsfiddle.net/ZQ26L/1/
[10:28:49] <rayn> is $(document).ready() equal to window.onload()?
[10:30:33] <brergq> rayn, the former is jquery specific I believe... Though, yes.
[10:30:37] <wroathe> rayn, not exactly. document.ready is a facade that detects browser support for dom ready events and executes your code when that happens. It's basically like cross-browser window.onload
[10:31:04] <brergq> http://jsfiddle.net/ZQ26L/4/
[10:31:06] <brergq> Sorry, better code.
[10:32:15] <rayn> So If I have a few images on my page,document.ready() will trigger even before all the images have finished loading?
[10:33:58] <wroathe> rayn, no, it might execute before they're displayed but the data will have been transferred
[10:34:32] <brergq> I think JS/JQ treats strings like arrays, so  for (123a)  i would str[3] = "\0";  ?
[10:34:43] <rayn> I'm trying to access the height() prop. of those images,but I'm getting 0 all the time
[10:36:11] <wroathe> If you're trying to get the height attribute of your image you're best bet would be .attr('height')
[10:36:39] <wroathe> .height() fetches the computed height in your css I believe (citation needed?)
[10:36:41] <ajpiano> rayn, wroathe document ready and window load, the main difference is whether it waits for images to have been loaded
[10:36:43] <ajpiano> so yes
[10:36:51] <ajpiano> you need window load if you want to measure the height of images
[10:37:39] <wroathe> ajpiano: Yeah. I just finished reading that :)
[10:37:43] <wroathe> Thanks for the correction.

[11:07:32] <thomedy> is anyone here
[11:26:26] <sunbeam> for some reason when i submit a form, and one checkbox range (called colors[]) i  only see the last color selected in php, and not the other 3 selected
[11:26:31] <sunbeam> any idea what i do wrong?
[11:33:52] <ordinaryman09> helo
[11:34:02] <ge2x> Hey people, I have contents of an html file fetched via .load() stored in a variable. How do I access a specific element (i.e. button) of the stored content?
[11:34:59] <ordinaryman09> any1 know how to post a json object?
[11:36:30] <libryder> ordinaryman09: have you tried passing it in as the param?
[11:39:23] <shoky> ge2x: what do you mean it's stored in a variable? what kind of variable?
[11:40:36] <t432> anyway way to check if server  returns any data?
[11:41:56] <nbari> hi all, i am using $.post to get json data, the data contains an array(keys,values)  where keys are the element names of a form like <input id="name"> i am using $.each to extrac the data and using something like $("#"+key).val(value) but wondering if there is a bette way of doing this instead of using the $('#'+key)
[11:46:59] <ge2x> nevermind, sorry, I am now trying to figure out a way to store what I get with .load into a var
[11:47:07] <ge2x> I'm quite fresh with jQuery
[11:47:28] <shoky> ge2x: .load is for storing it into an element
[11:48:00] <ge2x> so I have to use .get?
[11:48:32] <shoky> if you just want to get it into a variable, .get is fine yea
[11:48:49] <shoky> (or just use $.ajax
[11:48:50] <shoky> )
[11:48:51] <sunbeam> for some reason when i submit a form, and one checkbox range (called colors[]) i  only see the last color selected in php, and not the other 3 selected
[11:48:54] <sunbeam> any idea what i do wrong?
[11:48:59] <ge2x> thanks!

[11:52:52] <t432> message in line in 14 is "Object object" - what does it mean? http://pastebin.com/NRuqvyqp
[11:53:03] <Lucky--> anyone try out jquery mobile 1.1.2 pre yet?
[11:53:24] <shoky> t432: that the response is an object. which makes sense because you passed dataType: 'json'
[11:54:03] <t432> shoky: how will i get its contents and display it?
[11:54:17] <shoky> t432: console.log
[11:54:31] <shoky> t432: forget about alerts
[11:58:02] <t432> shoky: I assume console.log with display the contents under the console tab in eclipse ide
[11:58:10] <t432> will*
[11:58:19] <t432> but i see nothing
[11:58:19] <shoky> t432: in the browser's console
[11:58:22] <t432> ah
[11:59:17] <t432> i see
[11:59:20] <t432> it
[11:59:50] <t432> how will format this data for display page?
[12:00:11] <t432> response.some_attribute?
[12:00:36] <shoky> response is a javascript object, yes
[12:00:46] <t432> thanks
[12:01:19] <ge2x> how can I turn the data passed to a .get callback function into a jquery object (so I could access a specific element in it)?
[12:01:43] <shoky> ge2x:  $( myHTML )
[12:01:56] <ge2x> thanks!
[12:10:29] <ordinaryman09> libryder: i did
[12:10:43] <ordinaryman09> well it can get the data as string
[12:10:58] <ordinaryman09> idk why but when we use json_decode from the server it doesnt work
[12:11:33] <shoky> ordinaryman09: you want to pass an actual json string?
[12:11:42] <ordinaryman09> yeah
[12:11:56] <ordinaryman09> so I request json from 1 server, and I want to post it to another server
[12:13:15] <shoky> ordinaryman09:  you have a variable in which there is a json string?
[12:13:23] <ordinaryman09> yes
[12:13:30] <shoky> or you have an object that you want to send as json?
[12:13:43] <ordinaryman09> i have a json variable
[12:15:04] <shoky> and what does it look like on the server?
[12:15:11] <shoky> when you just send that string as the ajax data
[12:15:22] <shoky> if you don't try to json_decode
[12:15:29] <shoky> just echo it
[12:15:35] <shoky> or log it or whatever
[12:15:38] <ordinaryman09> it's giving me the the right thing
[12:15:45] <shoky> a json string?
[12:15:48] <ordinaryman09> yea
[12:15:56] <ordinaryman09> but I tried decode and encode it
[12:15:59] <ordinaryman09> it gives me null
[12:16:06] <shoky> ok so you have a php/json prob, i donno ;)
[12:16:27] <ordinaryman09> my ison is right
[12:16:34] <ordinaryman09> i already validate it
[12:16:38] <shoky> but you dont know how to decode it in php
[12:16:42] <shoky> hence php/json ;P
[12:17:02] <shoky> why would you want to decode it anyway
[12:17:11] <shoky> why are you trying to achieve here
[12:17:43] <FernandoBasso> Is it possible to pass the value of $(this) so that I can use that element with the return data of a $.post() request?
[12:17:47] <shoky> nvm
[12:18:01] <ordinaryman09> i decode and encode just to debug the problem
[12:18:13] <ordinaryman09> because the decode doesn't work
[12:18:39] <shoky> pastebin the json string..
[12:19:07] <shoky> FernandoBasso: what?
[12:20:30] <FernandoBasso> I need to use $(this) inside a $.post.
[12:21:13] <sunbeam> damn it is so hard to send checkboxes to a php script with $.ajax
[12:21:15] <shoky> var $this = $(this);  $.post(...);   ?
[12:21:21] <sunbeam> and have them appear in one array (and not x amount)
[12:22:41] <shoky> sunbeam: pastebin your html/js/php
[12:23:42] <sunbeam> var content = $("form").serializeArray(); $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: 'php/mailForm.php',data: { value: content } });
[12:25:56] <shoky> so you're not submitting a form
[12:26:17] <sunbeam> I am
[12:26:24] <shoky> no, you are sending an ajax request
[12:26:34] <sunbeam> yea, what is the difference?
[12:26:41] <shoky> totally different things
[12:26:47] <sunbeam> I cannot submit this
[12:27:04] <sunbeam> the form consists of some custom options that block submitting the normal way
[12:27:24] <shoky> i didn't say you have to submit it
[12:27:58] <sunbeam> i just like to wrap all the checked checkboxes together in one array
[12:27:58] <shoky> so, your data is this object:  { value: content }    where content is an array
[12:28:05] <sunbeam> instead of 8 different arrays
[12:28:05] <sunbeam> yes
[12:28:26] <sunbeam> i know i can write a custom function in php to do this
[12:28:32] <sunbeam> i just thought this should be doable without
[12:28:42] <shoky> so in your php you should be getting one param called value that is an array
[12:29:00] <shoky> or maybe value[] donno
[12:29:25] <shoky> try:
[12:30:22] <shoky> umm
[12:30:36] <shoky> $("form").serialize()
[12:30:56] <sunbeam> i already tried that
[12:31:11] <sunbeam> same
[12:31:27] <sunbeam> and i need to write another function aswell to unserialize it
[12:31:45] <shoky> var content = $("form").serialize();  $.ajax({..., data: content}});
[12:32:57] <sunbeam> yes thats what i do now
[12:33:44] <shoky> that should work fine
[12:34:06] <sunbeam> yes, but how can i unserialize it in php?
[12:34:46] <shoky> $_POST['checkboxName']
[12:34:56] <shoky> should be an array of the checked checkboxes
[12:35:10] <sunbeam> wait i paste the result in php
[12:35:28] <sunbeam> eh no thers no $_POST['checkBoxName']
[12:35:38] <sunbeam> it is $_POST['value'] which is a string
[12:35:53] <shoky> ?
[12:36:20] <shoky> we removed the 'value'
[12:36:31] <shoky> data: $("form").serialize()
[12:36:32] <shoky> no value
[12:36:57] <sunbeam> ehh sec i guess $_POST will be a string then
[12:36:58] <sunbeam> wait
[12:37:11] <shoky> wat
[12:37:11] <b-ot> Hy just wondering if you had ever made any images with those tick boxes i.e portrait would look great.
[12:37:19] <sunbeam> shoky: you know what serialize does?
[12:37:27] <shoky> ya
[12:37:30] <sunbeam> convert all values into a string
[12:37:41] <sunbeam> separated by &
[12:37:54] <shoky> right
[12:38:03] <sunbeam> ok, but i need to know how i can unserialize that
[12:39:20] <shoky> $.ajax should already do that for you if you specify type: 'POST'
[12:40:59] <sunbeam> it doesn't
[12:41:38] <shoky> does for me.
[12:42:36] <shoky> sunbeam: from $.ajax docs:  The data option can contain either a query string of the form key1=value1&key2=value2, or a map of the form {key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2'}. If the latter form is used, the data is converted into a query string using jQuery.param() before it is sent.
[12:43:07] <shoky> wouldn't matter if you sent an object instead of the query string
[12:46:08] <sunbeam> yes the first is sent
[12:46:19] <shoky> are you doing  data: $('form').serialize()   ?
[12:48:17] <F-14_Tomcat> hello, would someone be willing to look at my rather simple fiddle and tell me how to get this span's id from being mapped to an array?
[12:48:35] <shoky> just post it
[12:48:44] <F-14_Tomcat> code or link?
[12:48:52] <shoky> this is irc. link
[12:49:06] <shoky> you cant paste a fiddle on irc anyway..
[12:49:12] <F-14_Tomcat> http://jsfiddle.net/rfwkQ/5/
[12:49:47] <shoky> and what's the issue?
[12:49:55] <F-14_Tomcat> so i've got a jquery ui sortable
[12:50:46] <F-14_Tomcat> and i'm putting the DOM structure into an array.  Problem is that when I go to get div of a div, it gives me a subarray with a span's id... even though I used the is("Div")
[12:56:08] <shoky> F-14_Tomcat: why are you doing  $(this).map(...   ?
[12:57:08] <F-14_Tomcat> what would you suggest, each(?
[12:57:16] <F-14_Tomcat> or am i off base?
[12:57:19] <shoky> well
[12:57:29] <shoky> if you're not using the return value of .map
[12:57:32] <shoky> there is no reason to use it
[12:57:38] <shoky> second,
[12:57:45] <shoky> your $(this) is just one single element
[12:57:55] <shoky> looping it is useless..
[12:58:06] <shoky> maybe you meant $(this).children('div').each(..   ?
[12:58:34] <F-14_Tomcat> ok lemme fiddle brb
[13:03:04] <F-14_Tomcat> side question: how do i get a variable to scope more globally?
[13:03:54] <shoky> you put it in a more global scope ;P
[13:04:04] <shoky> define it, that is
[13:04:07] <austinallen_> F-14_Tomcat, omit the var
[13:04:32] <F-14_Tomcat> ah gotcha
[13:05:31] <shoky> F-14_Tomcat: did you mean mor like this ? http://jsfiddle.net/rfwkQ/7/
[13:07:12] <F-14_Tomcat> good lord that's clever
[13:07:19] <F-14_Tomcat> i've been stump'n my head all afternoon
[13:07:23] <F-14_Tomcat> thanks shoky
[13:07:30] <shoky> or even: http://jsfiddle.net/rfwkQ/8/
[13:08:02] <shoky> if .map would let you return an array to be pushed into the resulting array, it could've been even shorter
[13:09:16] <F-14_Tomcat> ic. i will study this. post it to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11698189/jquery-multidimensional-array-of-dom-element-children if you want tickey points
[13:09:53] <F-14_Tomcat> otherwise, i'll edit/update
[13:09:54] <F-14_Tomcat> thanks!
[13:10:09] <shoky> that's ok you go ahead
[13:30:47] <fructose> I am trying to use .autocomplete() on a dynamically-created input and neither works nor produces an error. Any ideas?
[13:30:58] <fructose> *it
[13:33:43] <fructose> The input is cloned using relcopy
[13:35:05] <godlfishh> hey, i have a question, I've set a cookie with path /, but I only see the cookie on subpages, not my homepage
[13:35:45] <godlfishh> like it works on EVERY page but homepage, the cookies doesn't exist, is there something I need to change
[13:38:56] <chachan> guys, I have this http://jsfiddle.net/chachan/BH4bL/ and it works when I do it through the console but fails when it runs within the file, is there any special behavior with the submit event for these cases?
[13:41:28] <shoky> chachan: for what cases?
[13:41:59] <chachan> I have a select item and when it's selected I choose a form to be sent. Since I don't want to send all the forms I remove  the non-selected ones
[13:42:25] <chachan> so only the form "selected" be sent
[13:43:04] <shoky> all this code does is change the value of the selected option to its text, and removes some div(s)
[13:43:15] <shoky> what fails?
[13:44:05] <tightwork> Hi. I have a <tr> that is .click(function(). There are links in the child <TD> but they do not work from single left click. I can cheese out firefox and right click open the link but it seems the click is taking over the link focus, what can I do?
[13:44:43] <chachan> shoky, it also remove the selected form. I checked the jQuery selector running thoses statements through the console and returning true on submit event and it works as expected
[13:45:24] <chachan> shoky, for some weird reason is not making its job when it runs through a external script
[13:45:42] <shoky> chachan: i dont understand, why are you removing forms when only one is being submitted?
[13:46:08] <chachan> shoky, sorry, I remove DIVs
[13:46:15] <shoky> why?
[13:46:32] <shoky> oh, they have inputs belonging to the form?
[13:47:05] <chachan> I have a group of DIVs which have inputs
[13:47:32] <chachan> so I want to send just one group and discard the rest
[13:47:47] <chachan> so I remove them on submit
[13:47:59] <chachan> well, that's what I'm trying to do
[13:48:28] <chachan> shoky, so yes
[13:51:44] <chachan> tightwork, this might help you http://goo.gl/Ov8dF
[13:52:16] <shoky> chachan looking at the request in the network tab, it seems to work fine: http://jsfiddle.net/BH4bL/1/
[13:53:25] <chachan> shoky, weird...
[13:54:05] <nveid> How would I perform an action with jquery anytime any item is clicked on the page that has a specific attribute? Doesn't matter what the value of it is
[13:54:13] <chachan> shoky, it's not sending those inputs
[13:54:27] <shoky> chachan: it's sending one of them each time, based on the select
[13:54:55] <chachan> shoky, what do you mean with "each time"?
[13:55:08] <shoky> chachan: each time i re-run the fiddle and submit the form
[13:55:10] <tightwork> chachan: thanks. I believe to found a different solution.. I removed return false; from the function.. This may be bad practice but it worked not sure why
[13:55:35] <shoky> chachan you can see more easily here what it sends:  http://jsfiddle.net/BH4bL/2/
[13:56:21] <chachan> nveid, http://api.jquery.com/has-attribute-selector/

[13:57:46] <mikeischris> Hey guys, I am trying to place the validation error in a div rather than after radio button, what am I doing wrong - http://jsfiddle.net/hja4A/
[14:00:02] <mikeischris> my errorPlacement doesn't seem to be working :(
[14:01:19] <nveid> chachan: what about say another action when they are subsequently clicked out of the div?
[14:01:31] <nveid> chachan: trying to configure a simple page editor
[14:01:51] <tw2113> mikeischris isn't it in the div? <div id="ofcourse" class=""><input id=coming name=rsvp  value=yes type=radio class="required" ><span><label for=coming>I'll be there with bells on</label></span> </div>
[14:03:15] <chachan> nveid, none of those solutions fit with your need?
[14:03:31] <shoky> mikeischris: you put errorPlacement as part of the 'rules' object
[14:04:02] <nveid> oh.. I see a not selector.. I'll try that
[14:04:04] <mikeischris> shoky: ahh
[14:05:04] <shoky> mikeischris: and, no need for .parent().next()
[14:05:06] <shoky> just .parent()
[14:05:14] <chachan> shoky, found the problem, I was replacing the option:selected value
[14:05:27] <mikeischris> shoky: Man….I have been researching this for hours!!! Thank you
[14:05:32] <shoky> chachan: i thought that's what you wanted to do
[14:05:36] <shoky> np mikeischris
[14:06:00] <shoky> mikeischris: a simple console.log at the start of errorPlacement would show you that it never gets called..
[14:06:19] <chachan> shoky, yes but the div's id won't match with the new value... Easy to fix. Thanks!
[14:06:42] <mikeischris> shoky: I see…I see :)
[14:09:18] <chachan> shoky, it's working perfectly now!!!

[15:14:56] <quarkie> Hi, when using the .appendTo() or .append() method, events which were bind with .on() have no effect on the newly added elements, have they?
[15:15:51] <sacho> quarkie, not unless the events are using delegated selectors
[15:15:53] <sacho> or whatever they call it.
[15:16:16] <hayer> quarkie: lol, having the exact same problem. How2solve?
[15:16:26] <jonathancutrell> Hey folks… Is it true that you can only do get requests cross origin? Shouldn't it be possible to set headers to allow cross origin post requests?
[15:16:38] <jonathancutrell> (through ajax, I mean)
[15:16:54] <quarkie> sacho: so the .on(event, selector, func) does not automatically uses delegates?
[15:17:00] <sacho> you need control of the server that you are sending to, jonathancutrell.
[15:17:10] <jonathancutrell> sacho: I have control of that server
[15:17:14] <sacho> quarkie, it depends how you use it.
[15:17:29] <jonathancutrell> I have enabled POST as a method on all header responses
[15:17:30] <sacho> jonathancutrell, then use the cors directives.
[15:18:12] <quarkie> sacho: so the selector in .on(event, selector, func) should go to a delegator?
[15:18:29] <hayer> is this even close to correct;
[15:18:30] <hayer> 	$().on("submit", "#rw-login", loginSubmit);
[15:18:30] <hayer> 	$().on("click", "#rw-logout", logoutSubmit);
[15:18:45] <sacho> quarkie, read the documentation or ask a specific question please, I don't know what you mean.
[15:19:53] <quarkie> haha, I did rtfm. but wait, maybe this could help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11705035/
[15:20:04] <quarkie> oh
[15:20:10] <quarkie> already answered
[15:20:31] <quarkie> hayer: sacho and the guy who answered have the same solution
[15:21:48] <hayer> quarkie: yea, got mine working with $(document).on("submit", "#rw-login", loginSubmit);
[15:32:05] <Noeble> queston: I have issues with adding position to a dropdown div when hovering a tabsystem. Here is the code + screenshot on whats happening. The blackbox should be one more tab to the right. http://pastebin.com/wZYgPtsT  http://mediadev.wemicgaming.com/js/custom/tabsystem.png
[15:32:10] <Noeble> anyone able to look a look?=
[15:37:00] <godlfishh> hey if i put a ("div.id").each within another$().each, does the $(this) transfer to the one within
[15:41:12] <sunbeam> how can I best check whether an execute of $.ajax({ }); was correct?
[15:41:21] <johnkpaul> godlfishh: no
[15:41:26] <johnkpaul> you can use $.proxy to do that
[15:41:29] <johnkpaul> ?proxy @godlfishh
[15:41:30] <bot-t> godlfishh, jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[15:41:42] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: what do you mean "was correct"?
[15:43:24] <sunbeam> returned true (eg. in this case, the form email was done)
[15:44:52] <johnkpaul> var deferred = $.ajax({}); //sometime in the future.... deferred.isResolved()
[15:45:09] <johnkpaul> but sunbeam, you can do you waht you need to do afer the ajax call has successfully completed in the success callbac
[15:45:25] <danheberden> johnkpaul: fwiw, isResolved() is getting deprecated in favour of .state()
[15:45:35] <danheberden> ?state
[15:45:38] <danheberden> oops
[15:45:39] <bot-t> danheberden, deferred.state() - Determine the current state of a Deferred object. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.state/
[15:45:41] <jonathancutrell> For some reason, my cross origin ajax posts are still getting denied; anyone have more information on how to circumvent this issue?
[15:45:52] <danheberden> oh it worked, good job bot-t
[15:45:53] <jonathancutrell> Cross origin get requests are working fine.
[15:45:54] <johnkpaul> danheberden: ah, didnt notice that, thanks!
[15:46:02] <johnkpaul> :) bot-t is just slow nowadays
[15:47:07] <johnkpaul> ah, so .state() handles all three options
[15:47:17] <danheberden> yeah just returns a string
[15:47:27] <sunbeam> johnkpaul: shouldnt i use error: ?
[15:47:33] <johnkpaul> I see
[15:47:41] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: I don't completely undestand what you're attempting to do
[15:48:21] <sunbeam> Ok
[15:48:23] <sunbeam> I got a  form
[15:48:34] <sunbeam> I submit it with $.ajax()
[15:48:59] <sunbeam> I'm wanting to get a result like "bad submit" when form e-mailing returns false
[15:49:50] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: $.ajax({}).then(successFunction, errorFunction)
[15:50:01] <johnkpaul> errorFunction will be called when there is an error with the ajax call
[15:50:08] <johnkpaul> I Don't know what you mean when you type "when form emailing returns false"
[15:50:13] <sunbeam> ok, how in my php script i can define whether it is in error?
[15:50:16] <johnkpaul> do you mean if the serer side returns false?
[15:50:22] <johnkpaul> ah, that's the repsonse code
[15:50:35] <sunbeam> should i add that in the php file?
[15:50:35] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#4xx_Client_Error
[15:50:48] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: in php, I don't rememebr off the top of my head how to do do it
[15:51:03] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: http://php.net/manual/en/function.header.php
[15:51:21] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: if you send a 4* error code, jquery will call the errorhandler
[15:51:31] <sunbeam> if (email()) { // form sent } else { header("HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request"); }
[15:51:32] <sunbeam> like this?
[15:51:50] <johnkpaul> ?tias @sunbeam
[15:51:50] <bot-t> sunbeam, Try It And See
[15:51:59] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: what happens when you try to post?
[15:52:37] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: I keep getting the Access Cross Origin Allow error
[15:52:53] <johnkpaul> you're sure that the domain is included in the whitelist from the server?
[15:52:59] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: I'm using a sinatra heroku app
[15:53:06] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: I'm setting allow to "*"
[15:53:37] <jonathancutrell> headers['Access-Control-Allow-Origin'] = '*'
[15:53:44] <jonathancutrell> and
[15:53:45] <jonathancutrell> headers['Access-Control-Allow-Methods'] = 'POST, GET'
[15:54:29] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: hmm, what is your content type
[15:54:31] <johnkpaul> the request content type?
[15:54:46] <jonathancutrell> whatever the default $.post sends
[15:54:48] <johnkpaul> it has to be formdata or plain text I believe
[15:54:52] <johnkpaul> oh ok, that's formdata then
[15:55:01] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: Right on.
[15:55:21] <sunbeam> johnkpaul: i have to define my function successFunction() separately?
[15:55:29] <johnkpaul> hmm, jonathancutrell, there's nothing obvious that I can think of
[15:55:35] <johnkpaul> you're sure the server isn'tbeing hit at all jonathancutrell?
[15:56:00] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: : what do you mean? you _could_ have an anonymous function there
[15:56:00] <jonathancutrell> Well, I know that the error message is the cross origin message.
[15:56:22] <sunbeam> johnkpaul: anonymous as in?
[15:56:30] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: I'm wondering if a preflight request is being attempted
[15:56:39] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: We changed it to a get request and it works fine. Obviously not ideal though.
[15:56:42] <johnkpaul> sunbeam: what do you mean by "define my function separatetly"
[15:57:22] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: hmm, nothing obvious wrong, can you show an example?
[15:57:29] <sunbeam> nvm i just didnt feel like defining these funtions outside the code
[15:57:35] <jonathancutrell> according to this...
[15:57:36] <jonathancutrell> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2699277/post-data-to-jsonp
[15:57:37] <sunbeam> because per ajax call the success and error function are different
[15:57:55] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: if it's JSONP, you can't use post at all
[15:58:06] <johnkpaul> CORS can use post
[15:58:18] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: you have no http auth, right?
[15:58:27] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: Only session auth
[15:58:38] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: but that's not necessary for the post request
[15:58:54] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: just to see the data on the back end.
[15:59:42] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6573874/jquery-ajax-cors-httponly-cookie
[15:59:51] <johnkpaul> don't necessarily know if it's related, but worth a read
[16:00:13] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: hrm - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10509774/sinatra-and-rack-protection-setting
[16:00:14] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: in your dev tools, you see only one request? with post?
[16:00:27] <jonathancutrell> yessir
[16:00:35] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: ah, does this work w/o cross origin?
[16:00:41] <johnkpaul> have you tried this from the same origin?
[16:01:08] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: I haven't
[16:01:22] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: you should try it, there might be unrelated problems
[16:01:37] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: well, the weird part is that it works fine with a get request.
[16:01:54] <ld16> I'm trying to programatically display tooltips with Crossrider/jquery, but nothing I've tried seems to work. I've tried tipsy, jqueryTools, and nothing seems to work
[16:01:55] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: right, but that might be a problem with the serverside
[16:02:06] <jonathancutrell> Like heroku not allowing cors?
[16:02:32] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: or your own setup not allowing post
[16:02:47] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: you can easily mimic this by changing your hosts file
[16:02:48] <jonathancutrell> http://blog.sourcebender.com/2010/06/09/introducin-rack-cors.html
[16:03:21] <johnkpaul> hm, do you have that gem installed, jonathancutrell
[16:03:30] <jonathancutrell> I haven't tried it, just found it.
[16:03:36] <jonathancutrell> I tried the other gem he's referring to
[16:03:38] <jonathancutrell> But,
[16:03:41] <jonathancutrell> part of the problem
[16:03:48] <jonathancutrell> is also that not all browsers will support CORS.
[16:03:59] <johnkpaul> IE8- do not
[16:04:03] <johnkpaul> IE8 does, but partially
[16:04:17] <Lucky--> http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/ oh noes. 404. Anyony got a mirror?
[16:04:52] <johnkpaul> Lucky--: I believe they're on github
[16:05:25] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: I'm honestly just about done trying to get this to work. Haha - What a retardedly unnecessarily difficult thing to debug.
[16:05:31] <ld16> I get errors like this Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'tooltip'
[16:05:39] <Lucky--> johnkpaul: yea checking now
[16:05:50] <johnkpaul> ld16: are you sure that you've included the plugin _before_ your code runs
[16:06:12] <ld16> I'm pretty sure. I just followed the crossrider call for loading external js
[16:06:14] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: what is your debugger of choice? I don't know if I've had these kinds of difficulties with the chrome debugger
[16:06:46] <johnkpaul> ld16: check if 'tooltip' in jQuery.fn
[16:06:48] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: I'm using Chrome, but that error doesn't give you all the information you need to get the full story.
[16:06:48] <ld16> johnkpaul, I call this "	appAPI.resources.includeJS('jquery.tools.min.js');
[16:06:48] <ld16> " then try to display the tooltips in a separate function
[16:07:05] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: not the error, but the network tab can help see what's happening
[16:07:12] <johnkpaul> ld16: I don't know enough about how crossirder works
[16:07:48] <ld16> as a hack, would just copying jquery.tools.min.js to the top of my file fix this problem if it is an include problem?
[16:08:03] <johnkpaul> ?tias @ld16
[16:08:03] <bot-t> ld16, Try It And See
[16:10:12] <ld16> bot-t, that worked.  now I just need to programmatically pretend that a mouse if over every anchor tag :/
[16:10:13] <Lucky--> https://dtzuojp79nhw2.cloudfront.net/mobile/Scripts/jquery.validate.min.js - just uploaded to my cdn if any of u guys need a reference.
[16:10:13] <bot-t> ld16, Couldn't find "that worked. now I just need to programmatically pretend that a mouse if over every anchor tag :/" in jQuery Docs.
[16:10:40] <johnkpaul> ld16: look into the cross rider docs, there has to be a way to control the order
[16:16:50] <ld16> also, the tooltips are all being displayed in the very top right of the screen now, even though I'm calling by the id?
[16:17:20] <ld16> using:			jQuery(theIDhash).tooltip().show();
[16:19:22] <johnkpaul> ld16: something wrong with the css probably
[16:49:44] <rretzbach> hi, I need to select an element which contains another element. I tried "tbody:has(tr:has(td[class='edVHeim edLiInactB']))" but [class=''] doesn't seem to work using ".class" doesn't work either. I want to get the next tbody which has a td.edVHeim as descendant
[16:57:34] <Tiberio> hi, is there a method to get the selector after a query. By example. var e = $("#my-element"); alert("Mi selector is " + e.getSelector());
[17:04:19] <johnkpaul> Tiberio: $().selector
[17:04:38] <johnkpaul> $jqObj.selector rather
[17:12:50] <kkoala> rretzbach: Try $("tbody:has(td.edVheim)")
[17:13:13] <rretzbach> I tried
[17:13:27] <rretzbach> Maybe I don't understand "next"
[17:13:41] <rretzbach> Because the tbody I am looking for isnt the immediate next sibling
[17:14:05] <rretzbach> tbody(here am i) tbody tbody(this I need)
[17:16:49] <kkoala> The :has filter gets all tbody's that have a td with your class as a descendant. Could you paste an example of your html and js?
[17:17:20] <kkoala> rretzbach : ^
[17:17:38] <rretzbach> kkoala: It's not my html unfortunately and it is built dynamically. You'd have to fill out some forms first :\
[17:17:51] <rretzbach> http://ergebnisdienst.fussball.de/vereinsspielplan/mettmanner-kickers/M22V22003083
[17:18:00] <rretzbach> see the table on the bottom :>
[17:18:22] <kkoala> ok, taking a look
[17:18:45] <rretzbach> I want to loop through all .edDatum and get the corresponding next occuring .edVHeim
[17:18:52] <rretzbach> This is the gist of it
[17:19:23] <rretzbach> The site already has jquery embedded, so the console can be used
[17:20:00] <rretzbach> I currently use nextUntil instead of "next"
[17:21:56] <linelevel> Hi guys, when I intercept a form submission (using a `submit` event listener), how can I get the submitted form parameters as a javascript object? I know I can serialize them with `$(this).serialize()`, but I'm not sure how to get them as an object.
[17:35:57] <brettfrable> Can anyone solve this
[17:36:01] <brettfrable> I have it somewhat solved
[17:36:04] <brettfrable> but not really

[17:36:11] <brettfrable> http://jsfiddle.net/
[17:50:36] <Gambit-> anyone used slickgrid?
[17:50:53] <Gambit-> I'm about ready to abandon jqgrid.

[18:05:36] <codepython7771> I have <input type="text" name="q" > <button class="button">Search</button> -- that posts a search currently. I would like to emulate this post using jquery and add more data to the post (say sort : True). How can I do this?
[18:12:18] <LindsayMac> Hey guys... i'm having some issues with a plugin conflicting with another plugin. If anyone has a moment to help, it would be hugely appreciated.
[18:12:30] <LindsayMac> I cant set up a test case, but I can give you access to my dev site if you give me your IP
[18:13:59] <codepython7771> LindsayMac: I'm a newbie, -- so cant help -- what plugins are conflicting?
[18:14:37] <LindsayMac> Well I am using a WP plugin called gravity forms which has this in the code" jQuery(this).chosen({no_results_text: noResultsText});
[18:14:56] <LindsayMac> I am betting jQuery(this).chosen is not a function, and i THINK its a conflict with something else, but not entirely sure
[18:15:28] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: chosen is a popular plugin
[18:15:33] <johnkpaul> ?g jquery chosen @ LindsayMac
[18:15:34] <bot-t> LindsayMac, Chosen - a JavaScript plugin for jQuery and Prototype - makes ... - http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[18:16:01] <LindsayMac> joeytwiddle:  so you're saying that its possible that the pluginw asnt included in my WP Plugin package?
[18:16:22] <codepython7771> Is this the correct way to post a form using jquery: http://pbin.be/show/705/ ?
[18:16:30] <codepython7771> or is there a better method?
[18:16:50] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: I'm assuming you're asking me
[18:16:54] <johnkpaul> and yes, I believe that is the case
[18:17:03] <rodd> LindsayMac check the output for $.fn.chosen in your console
[18:17:05] <LindsayMac> johnkpaul:  i just checked.. chosen.jquery.min is there
[18:17:22] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: then it's an order problem
[18:17:30] <johnkpaul> you need to include chosen before your code
[18:17:41] <johnkpaul> codepython7771: that depends on what you're trying to do
[18:17:43] <LindsayMac> johnkpaul:  its being called in the header of my site
[18:17:46] <johnkpaul> if the form already exists on the page, you don't have to go through that
[18:17:54] <Gambit-> Hey, chatter - anyone have a grid object they would recommend, or have experience with?
[18:17:57] <rodd> LindsayMac first, what`s the error message you're getting?
[18:17:59] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: yes, but your header probably includes many script tags, it deends on the order
[18:18:13] <LindsayMac> johnkpaul:  TypeError: jQuery(this).chosen is not a function
[18:18:20] <johnkpaul> ^ @ rodd
[18:18:29] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: can you send your link
[18:18:34] <brettfrable> http://jsfiddle.net/Baac2/42/
[18:18:41] <LindsayMac> johnkpaul:  need your IP to give you access, but sure
[18:18:47] <brettfrable> can someone help - i need that to stop resizing when the scrollbar reaches the bottom
[18:18:49] <brettfrable> not halfway
[18:19:21] <LindsayMac> i installed this wordpress plugin and its' a VERY popular one that i've never heard of any issues with like this, so i'm certain its probably conflicting with something I also have in there
[18:19:54] <LindsayMac> and in the stack, it is calling gformInitChosenFields
[18:20:38] <codepython7771> johnkpaul: I have a search that currently posts as -- <input type="text" name="q" > <button class="button">Search</button> -- that posts a search currently.  I want to send more parameters to this search button if the user wants to say sort the search output. I was thinking just do the post, but now with more data. Hence the need to post form from jquery with additional data?
[18:21:51] <codepython7771> or perhaps i'm approaching this completely incorrectly. Any advice is appreciated
[18:22:35] <johnkpaul> codepython7771: hm, you can add hidden inputs if you want
[18:22:50] <johnkpaul> I've never seen the method where a new form element is created and submitted just for that purpose
[18:22:56] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: at that time, is chosen included?
[18:23:25] <codepython7771> johnkpaul: I guess i can remove my form and do a jquery.post directly - but then i've to  change existing code
[18:23:34] <codepython7771> johnkpaul: is that how you recommend doing it?
[18:23:34] <LindsayMac> it appears so
[18:23:40] <LindsayMac> johnkpaul:  i can give you access if you wanna see
[18:24:11] <johnkpaul> codepython7771: if you want it to be a traditional form subit, I'd recommend that you update hidden form elements
[18:26:22] <codepython7771> johnkpaul: but here is the problem. So I've a search page that posts the form. Then I'm on a new results page, that allows the user to sort, say based on "age" of people reported in the results. So you are suggesting that I modify the search form on the search+results page to have more hidden inputs and then use them to post using jquery?
[18:26:35] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: when you say that it appears so, why do you say that?
[18:26:56] <LindsayMac> johnkpaul:  I am new to JS so I am not very good at understanding all of the debugging results.
[18:27:13] <johnkpaul> codepython7771: they are currently posted using jquery? I thought it was a normal form submit
[18:27:33] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: :) well that's what you're here for, right?
[18:27:43] <johnkpaul> why do you think that chosen _is_ included at that time?
[18:27:54] <codepython7771> johnkpaul: its posted using just post. but i could modify it to use jquery.
[18:27:57] <LindsayMac> abslutely.. i have learned a WHOLE lot via this group and wacking stuff into submission
[18:28:08] <codepython7771> johnkpaul: whats the best way to code something like this?
[18:28:09] <johnkpaul> codepython7771: why do you prefer that?
[18:28:18] <johnkpaul> codepython7771: that's a gigantic "it depends"
[18:28:54] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: good, that's the path that you should continue
[18:29:09] <codepython7771> johnkpaul: I'm a newbie. I could use some advice. How does Google do it? -- Lemme check
[18:29:18] <LindsayMac> johnkpaul:  I am not new to coding. I am very good with php, html, and css... but VERY new to js
[18:29:46] <johnkpaul> codepython7771: how does google do what? get search results? that's a bit complicated
[18:30:03] <LindsayMac> haha
[18:30:22] <codepython7771> johnkpaul: no post the search text to its backend. Seems like its using a simple button + javascript -- i dont see the onclick () thou
[18:31:20] <johnkpaul> codepython7771: it's not using onclick in the dom, it's adding the event through javascript
[18:31:28] <LindsayMac> Woah.. i fixed it..
[18:31:33] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: awesome!
[18:31:35] <johnkpaul> what did you do?
[18:31:39] <LindsayMac> weird! The plugin wasn't actualy calling that script correctly.
[18:31:46] <LindsayMac> as you said.. it was an order of how things were being called
[18:31:53] <codepython7771> ah! They also support search as you type -- thats bad. I need something that does not support that.  Stackoverflow uses form submission
[18:31:53] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: congratulations!
[18:31:55] <LindsayMac> but I had to get in t the plugin to see what they were doing
[18:32:04] <johnkpaul> yeah, that's often the case
[18:32:05] <LindsayMac> thanks johnkpaul .. you pointed me in the right direction
[18:32:10] <johnkpaul> you have to read the code to understand it
[18:32:16] <johnkpaul> no problem, I'm glad you got it fixed!
[18:32:27] <LindsayMac> johnkpaul:  yea.. but its nice to have someone give you a little push in the direction
[18:32:37] <johnkpaul> yes, definitely, that's what we're here for
[18:33:55] <shoky> i'm here for the bewbies
[18:34:50] <johnkpaul> :) shoky, you much more so than I usually
[18:34:59] <johnkpaul> so thanks much to you shoky
[18:35:26] <shoky> ;]
[18:35:33] <shoky> are you sayin i have large bewbs
[18:35:33] <LindsayMac> i am really surprised that such a majorly popular pluging for WP dropped this ball
[18:37:52] <rodd> no vortex this time
[18:38:44] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: what's the plugin? it might just be a version issue
[18:40:27] <LindsayMac> gravity Forms.. its the most recent version.. jus tbought it
[18:43:15] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: oh, it costs money, you should let them know of your bugfix
[18:44:03] <rodd> and prob ask for a refund
[18:44:19] <johnkpaul> at least a discount
[18:44:22] <LindsayMac> johnkpaul:  yea... i am going to email them. I was just surprised because the WP community seems to be OBSESSED and totall inlove with this
[18:44:45] <johnkpaul> LindsayMac: eh, there are bugs in all sorts of software
[18:44:59] <LindsayMac> Oh i know.. id be surprised if i was the first to point it out
[18:47:55] <GyorsCsiga> LindsayMac, I don't know if this has already been covered but, have you tried installing this plugin on a fresh install of wordpress?
[18:48:01] <GyorsCsiga> with nothing else on it :)
[18:48:27] <LindsayMac> GyorsCsiga:  no i havent... but it wasn't an issue of conflict. It was an issue of it didnt link to a dependent js fie
[18:49:33] <rodd> boredom strikes again
[18:49:39] <LindsayMac> rodd:  NOOOOO
[18:49:52] <GyorsCsiga> kk
[18:50:35] <GyorsCsiga> I'm never bored, just overwhelmed.
[18:50:43] <GyorsCsiga> there's loads of stuffs I want to do :S
[18:51:53] <rodd> Id like to work on a personal project but I have to finish this other thing. I've hit a wall hence im bored
[18:52:06] <GyorsCsiga> rodd, that happens to me too, no time for toy projects
[18:52:21] <GyorsCsiga> rodd, I've debated quitting for that reason :p
[18:52:30] <rodd> its such a nice project
[18:53:11] <GyorsCsiga> all I need is a cardboard box …. with an electrical outlet and a wireless connection for the interwebz… and a local soup kitchen and I'd be a happy hobo
[18:53:25] <LindsayMac> Hmm im tried ariel fliesers scrollTo and it doesnt seem to want to work
[18:53:31] <LindsayMac> i know.. that doesnt help you help me
[18:53:36] <GyorsCsiga> rodd, what's the project?
[18:53:46] <rodd> Im gonna immerse my head in a bucket of ice
[18:54:05] <GyorsCsiga> that sounds like a nice project
[18:54:17] <rodd> GyorsCsiga the project is aimed at people learning new languages
[18:54:23] <codepython7771> LindsayMac: Wordpress + bootstrap : do they go well together? I've never used wordpress, but would like to know more what its useful for
[18:54:32] <GyorsCsiga> rodd, programming languages or natural languages?
[18:54:36] <rodd> (idioms, not related to computing)
[18:54:41] <LindsayMac> codepython7771:  that doesnt really make sense..
[18:54:56] <GyorsCsiga> GyorsCsiga, nice, I'm into foreign languages myself, I'm learning Hungarian
[18:54:58] <LindsayMac> i mean.. they are entirely different things so it would depend if you want to theme a site using bootstrap or not
[18:55:05] <GyorsCsiga> haha
[18:55:08] <GyorsCsiga> did I just talk to myself
[18:55:14] <codepython7771> LindsayMac: I dont know anything about wordpress. It says on its website : WordPress is web software you can use to create a beautiful website or blog -- well you can do the same thing with TB. Whats the difference?
[18:55:20] <GyorsCsiga> rodd, nice, I'm into foreign languages myself I'm learning Hungarian
[18:55:31] <LindsayMac> codepython7771:  wordpress is a content management system
[18:55:38] <rodd> GyorsCsiga yeah, then it could be helpful to you
[18:59:02] <codepython7771> LindsayMac: whats the backend database usually? or there is no db?
[18:59:03] <LindsayMac> codepython7771:  do you undertstand what wordpress is now?
[18:59:22] <LindsayMac> codepython7771:  its a content management.. it hooks in to a database.. there needs to be somewhere for the content to go
[18:59:33] <codepython7771> understood
[19:05:00] <LindsayMac> anyone who's bored want to take a look at my smooth scrolling script? i tried scrollTo but it seems the my previous one was much smoother than Ariel;s
[19:07:08] <rodd> LindsayMac link?
[19:07:20] <LindsayMac> rodd:  i need your IP so I can give you access first.. soryr
[19:07:46] <LindsayMac> client wanted it developed on their domain so the domain has a redirect for all viewers except those I define
[19:09:18] <LindsayMac> rodd:  should be all set
[19:11:49] <rodd> LindsayMac so, what's the matter?
[19:12:08] <LindsayMac> rodd:  the scroll appears VERY choppy.. does it appear choppy to you?
[19:12:27] <LindsayMac> basically i'd like you to look at this code, and then i will initiate a different scroller, which has issues, but it appears to be smoother
[19:12:35] <LindsayMac> and decide which is the best option
[19:14:03] <rodd> yes seems very lagging
[19:14:14] <LindsayMac> ok..
[19:14:22] <LindsayMac> so let me turn on the other one.. one moment
[19:15:05] <LindsayMac> the other one was smoother BUT I can't seem to work out the hash nav
[19:15:28] <LindsayMac> rodd:  clear cache and have another look
[19:17:19] <acidjazz> is there a way to convert a $(...) returned object to what document.getElementById returns?
[19:19:53] <yedimind> a singular object instead of a collection you mean acidjazz ?
[19:20:15] <yedimind> $('#something').eq(0) will give you the first matched item as a singular object
[19:22:23] <sahbeewah> he means getting the dom element
[19:22:31] <sahbeewah> use .get(index)
[19:23:14] <sahbeewah> $('#element').get(0) === document.getElementById('element')
[19:43:31] <LindsayMac> I need some help with a hash being appended to my url and linking directly to a target
[19:44:49] <Lucky--> jquery mobile?
[19:45:36] <LindsayMac> no.. its just a script i kinda hacked together while learning js
[19:45:56] <LindsayMac> Lucky--:  here it is https://gist.github.com/3cbcb6c555ae7bbb8d02
[19:48:17] <LindsayMac> any thoughts?
[19:51:20] <LindsayMac> nothin?
[20:05:31] <sahbeewah> what are you trying to do
[20:05:47] <sahbeewah> i mean, what's the problem
[20:08:12] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:  was that for me?
[20:08:36] <sahbeewah> yes
[20:08:47] <LindsayMac> I am trying to make a smooth scrolling that also allows you to link to a target container from outside of the page.
[20:09:02] <LindsayMac> so I need to append the hash, but I am new and missed a couple things
[20:10:36] <sahbeewah> so what is it not doing?
[20:10:52] <LindsayMac> it is stranging appending #content to the url which is the parent container.
[20:11:02] <LindsayMac> I can give you access to my dev site if you give me your ip address
[20:11:41] <foucist> hey guys.. is there a super simple way to make clicking on an image remove not just the max-width, but make it overlay everything else?
[20:11:45] <foucist> i guess maybe change the z-index?
[20:11:57] <foucist> rather than being a lightbox type of thing
[20:12:21] <foucist> just kind of wondering about the simpler way
[20:12:31] <LindsayMac> onclick(.addclass
[20:12:57] <defaultro> hey folks, why is there a : from $(':button').click(function() {}); ?
[20:13:48] <johnkpaul> defaultro: http://api.jquery.com/button-selector/
[20:13:54] <defaultro> k
[20:14:37] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:  any thoughts?
[20:14:51] <defaultro> what is wrong when : is removed?
[20:15:04] <johnkpaul> defaultro: it wouln't include input type="button"
[20:15:18] <defaultro> is it because button is not an element?
[20:15:40] <johnkpaul> defaultro: :button is the same as "button, input[type=button]"
[20:15:56] <johnkpaul> defaultro: did you read the docs I sent you?
[20:15:58] <sahbeewah> LindsayMac: i don't really understand
[20:16:03] <defaultro> i mean, if I write it like this, $('button').click( ....
[20:16:27] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:  i have a single page website style website where it scrolls to div containers instead of going to another page.
[20:16:30] <sahbeewah> you're clicking on an anchor and it's writing the wrong hash tag?
[20:16:35] <sahbeewah> right
[20:16:38] <defaultro> so basically, i should just get used to writing it as $(':button').......
[20:16:53] <LindsayMac> right now, its linking to the ocrrect container and then it flashes to the wrong one.
[20:17:00] <LindsayMac> I can show you if you give me your ip
[20:17:52] <johnkpaul> defaultro: no, not at all, I am confused about your question
[20:17:54] <johnkpaul> what are you asking?
[20:18:35] <defaultro> like when refering to  <p>, we write it as $('p'), there is no :
[20:19:05] <defaultro> but on input type='button', we write it as $(':button')....
[20:19:29] <defaultro> there is a colon symbol prepended before button
[20:20:10] <sahbeewah> the : denotes a special property selector
[20:20:19] <sahbeewah> when you're using $(tagname) it selects tag names
[20:20:41] <sahbeewah> but you can do $(":disabled") to retrieve disabled elements, $(":checked") etc
[20:20:49] <defaultro> k
[20:21:05] <sahbeewah> also :button is deprecated
[20:21:19] <sahbeewah> use $("input[type=button]")
[20:21:24] <defaultro> k
[20:35:25] <linelevel> [bump] Hi guys, when I intercept a form submission (using a `submit` event listener), how can I get the submitted form parameters as a javascript object? I know I can serialize them with `$(this).serialize()`, but I'm not sure how to get them as an object.
[20:35:54] <sahbeewah> you can't
[20:35:56] <sahbeewah> write your own script for it
[20:36:06] <sahbeewah> there's a plugin as well i believe
[20:36:14] <sahbeewah> you can also use serializeArray()
[20:39:00] <daftspunk> i am new to jQuery.deferred, anyone care to review my code to see if i can cut down the amount of lines needed? http://pastebin.com/2FRanyxN
[20:41:00] <daftspunk> specifically var deferred = $.Deferred(); deferred.resolve(); return deferred;
[20:41:28] <johnkpaul> daftspunk: that's fine, you can return $.Deferred().resolve() I believe, but even if not, you might want to look into the q library
[20:41:37] <johnkpaul> it has something waterfall-like built in
[20:42:17] <daftspunk> oh awesome will check it out thanks
[20:42:42] <johnkpaul> daftspunk: https://github.com/kriskowal/q/
[20:42:51] <johnkpaul> no problem
[20:42:59] <daftspunk> haha was about to ask, googling 'q' didnt exactly give me much
[20:43:44] <linelevel> sahbeewah: That seems kind of silly, since all the AJAX methods ($.get, $.post, etc.) take an object as their `data` attribute.
[20:45:02] <sahbeewah> they also take strings
[20:46:01] <lotus> What a great part to come into a conversation
[20:46:07] <lotus> What do they do with the strings they take?
[20:46:18] <jhsto> guys, how do i get values of multiple elements?
[20:46:34] <sahbeewah> they're query strings
[20:46:38] <sahbeewah> it does just as expected
[20:47:06] <sahbeewah> name=value&name2=value2
[20:50:01] <linelevel> sahbeewah: Is there any benefit to using the serializeObject() plugin rather than calling serializeArray() and building an object from its (name, value) pairs?
[20:50:36] <linelevel> sahbeewah: The benefit of the latter would be that serializeArray() is probably better maintained, since its a part of jQuery.
[20:52:46] <sahbeewah> erm, i don't think it matters, assuming it works
[20:53:16] <sahbeewah> but again, if you're using it for an ajax request you can just use serialize
[20:57:35] <codepython7771> I need to change some data in a form and post using jquery. For posting I can var postData = $('#formId').serialize(); $.post(url,  postData); -- how do i change the variables in formid?
[20:59:45] <sahbeewah> what variable?
[21:00:29] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:  you still around?
[21:00:32] <codepython7771> sahbeewah: In my form i've a variable named "q" and "age" , one you is a normal input and one is a hidden input
[21:00:55] <codepython7771> $('#formId').attr('q', 'xxx') ?
[21:01:17] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:  if you have a moment, and you still have the link, can you take a look at the site. I was just browsing it fine on my comtpuer and then walked over to my husband's and the scroll wasnt working
[21:02:20] <LindsayMac> I have NO explaination as to why it would work on my comptuer and not his.. its all so bizarre.
[21:02:55] <sahbeewah> LindsayMac: different browser?
[21:03:10] <LindsayMac> nope
[21:03:17] <LindsayMac> same identical compuiter, in fact
[21:03:25] <LindsayMac> does it work for you?
[21:03:27] <sahbeewah> codepython7771: $('#formId input[name=q]').val(...);
[21:03:34] <sahbeewah> yeah it works for me
[21:03:43] <LindsayMac> ok well thats good news.
[21:03:56] <LindsayMac> i think maybe our internet is crazy glitchy and things just dont load all the way
[21:05:09] <sahbeewah> what actually happens?
[21:05:30] <LindsayMac> it was skipping to the divs without any animation AND the photos were all broken up
[21:06:17] <LindsayMac> I wonder if it's best to not load the navigation until the bg photos have loaded?
[21:06:31] <LindsayMac> Bahhh now its not working for me!
[21:06:33] <LindsayMac> WTF1
[21:06:44] <tw2113> you misspelled !
[21:06:49] <LindsayMac> nope.. its not scrollling for me !
[21:07:00] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  i literally want to bang my head into a wall right now!
[21:07:02] <tw2113> :P
[21:07:11] <tw2113> stop ripping off my exercise routine
[21:08:25] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:  it has completely stopped scrolling, and i have made NO changes to anything between then and now
[21:09:53] <sahbeewah> works for me
[21:09:57] <sahbeewah> inspect the console
[21:10:01] <LindsayMac> does this make ANY sense at all?
[21:10:07] <LindsayMac> did you clear your cache and try again?
[21:10:57] <libryder> https://gist.github.com/3195993
[21:11:01] <sahbeewah> yeh it's fine
[21:11:24] <LindsayMac> WTF.. how am I supposed to tell me husband.. well, it works everywhere but here.. so yea - its done, but you can't see it
[21:12:46] <sahbeewah> i tell my boss that all the time
[21:12:52] <LindsayMac> lol
[21:14:28] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah: just made a screencast. Hold tight
[21:14:31] <LindsayMac> this is ridiculous
[21:15:22] <tw2113> *makes a face more ridiculous*
[21:16:04] <LindsayMac> impossible
[21:16:14] <tw2113> i didn't even change it and i still succeeded
[21:16:27] <LindsayMac> impossible`
[21:16:35] <tw2113> impossibru?
[21:17:01] <tw2113> http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120530015843/villains/images/3/37/Impossibru.jpg
[21:17:22] <LindsayMac> LMAO
[21:18:09] <LindsayMac> well i made a screencast but it says 11minutes to upload
[21:18:31] <tw2113> takes longer to upload than it does to watch?
[21:18:45] <LindsayMac> yes
[21:18:50] <LindsayMac> because its only 1 minute
[21:19:50] <tw2113> 1:10 ratio
[21:19:52] <tw2113> suckage
[21:19:55] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  you have the link, can you check to see if it's scrolling too?
[21:20:01] <LindsayMac> I just need confirmation that its not me
[21:20:25] <tw2113> splashscreening
[21:20:43] <LindsayMac> ip?
[21:20:46] <LindsayMac> must have changed
[21:21:29] <tw2113> i'm not at a coffee shop at the moment either
[21:22:04] <min|dvir|us> Hi. I want a function that, when called, will execute, but only after Ajax is loaded. What's the best way to do this? Promises?
[21:22:07] <LindsayMac> I read something about ISPs forcing changing IPS every so often because they dont want people hosting websites from their hosue
[21:22:18] <tw2113> yeah, no scrollage for me
[21:22:21] <LindsayMac> promise diamonds
[21:22:28] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  is it acting all crazy glitchy?
[21:22:44] <tw2113> a bit
[21:22:48] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:  did you see that?? tw2113 cant scroll either
[21:23:20] <tw2113> i can't give birth either...do you see that sahbeewah ?
[21:23:24] <tw2113> jk don't hurt me
[21:23:47] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  try it now..
[21:23:55] <tw2113> seems to almost be loading the bg's slow
[21:24:15] <LindsayMac> oops.. hold on
[21:24:21] <tw2113> and not refreshing them completely
[21:24:42] <tw2113> ReferenceError: none is not defined
[21:24:42] <tw2113> [Break On This Error] 	
[21:24:42] <tw2113> $.scrollTo( this.hash, 4000, { easing:none});
[21:24:51] <LindsayMac> yea my bad
[21:24:56] <codepython7771> I'm trying to post a form and get back html that should be displayed. I post the form using jquery that goes thru. How do i render the new html that I got back?
[21:25:01] <LindsayMac> try now
[21:25:02] <codepython7771> It seems that does not happen automatically
[21:25:20] <LindsayMac> codepython7771:  you're gonna have everyone here write your app for you
[21:25:48] <codepython7771> $.post("/search",  postData); -- this is my post. I tried $.post("/search",  postData, reloadPage); -- do i have to write a reloadPage?
[21:26:20] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  now?
[21:26:51] <tw2113> seems to be a bit better, but if you're supposed to be able to use a mouse scroll wheel, that's not working
[21:27:05] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  nope. I disabled that. No need for it
[21:27:16] <tw2113> then it seems to be working
[21:27:28] <hoolter> how can i find out programatically that $('#doesnt_exist') returned no elements?
[21:27:36] <sahbeewah> erm, i don't even know what the intended animation behavior is
[21:27:40] <coldhead> don't you people have lives
[21:27:40] <b-ot> coldhead, you have one new message, just say “read” to me when you wish to read it.
[21:27:45] <coldhead> if ($('#doesnt_exist').length === 0)
[21:27:45] <sahbeewah> but it's a more erratic in ff
[21:27:46] <LindsayMac> coldhead:  nope
[21:27:50] <tw2113> $('#doesnt_exist).length
[21:27:56] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:  you talking about my thing?
[21:28:02] <sahbeewah> yeh
[21:28:10] <sahbeewah> it's fine in chrome
[21:28:17] <tw2113> coldhead lives were sold out at Walmart
[21:28:21] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:  I really want to have the "curtain" effect where one slides up and the other is underneath it
[21:28:34] <coldhead> i have an itunes giftcard, let me get you some from the apple store
[21:28:51] <LindsayMac> i achieved it simply with fixed BG image and smooth scrolling
[21:29:04] <codepython7771> LindsayMac: any tips for me. I can do location.reload() but that loads up the empty search page instead of the results page.
[21:29:13] <LindsayMac> codepython7771:  no//
[21:29:21] <codepython7771> I know that the post does compute the search results
[21:29:45] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:  do you understnd the idea that I want now?
[21:31:22] <sahbeewah> i'm seeing this trippy thing where a horizontal white bar goes up/down depending on the page, then the content area thing goes up, then goes down and fades in the next page
[21:31:46] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:  the white bar "wipes" up to reveal content beneath...
[21:31:48] <tw2113> sounds right
[21:33:50] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:  kinda like a sliding door effect
[21:34:15] <sahbeewah> yeah it looks fine on my computer
[21:34:18] <sahbeewah> on either browser
[21:34:24] <sahbeewah> despite it being a little jittery
[21:34:30] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:  did you have any ideas on how to get that effect more effectively?
[21:34:57] <LindsayMac> http://millwrightsrestaurant.com/screencast.swf
[21:35:02] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:
[21:36:40] <LindsayMac> I guess like this http://curtain.victorcoulon.fr/#intro
[21:36:41] <sahbeewah> that's pretty epic
[21:36:44] <LindsayMac> but mine is not
[21:36:49] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:  RIGHT?!
[21:37:30] <sahbeewah> it's probably because i have a slower net connection, some things are out of sync
[21:37:30] <codepython7771> I tried $.ajaxSetup({async:false}); -- tried reloadPage (reloads the wrong page) -- any other ideas how i can post the form and get the output rendered normally using jquery?
[21:37:34] <sahbeewah> animations get a little tricky
[21:37:54] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:  its the white box dropping down that gets a little "tricky"?
[21:38:59] <codepython7771> the backend server does get a call, sorts correctly, then tries to render the html. The browser just sits on the same page that it was. If I use location.reload() it loads another page...
[21:42:47] <sahbeewah> i can't replicate that on my computer
[21:43:32] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:  i guess thats a GOOD thing...
[21:46:01] <LindsayMac> my husband is optimizing all images as much as possibl
[21:47:43] <codepython7771> LindsayMac: can you please point me in the right direction. What I am doing wrong? In case you know.
[21:48:28] <LindsayMac> codepython7771:  you have become a burden.. I helped you a LOT and I watch people here hand hold you through making this website.
[21:48:53] <LindsayMac> each and every step of the way you have someone pasting code for you
[21:49:39] <codepython7771> LindsayMac: If you want me to read something, please do let me know. Indeed I've been helped a lot. And I've learnt a lot in the process.
[21:50:05] <LindsayMac> codepython7771: like i said.. im over it at this point.
[21:50:08] <LindsayMac> google is your friend. Use it
[21:51:03] <codepython7771> I tried the two things I got from google : $.ajaxSetup({async:false}); and reloadPage -- none of them work for me.
[21:51:14] <sahbeewah> lol
[21:51:17] <sahbeewah> what are you trying to do?
[21:51:44] <LindsayMac> not working helps no one in answering your question
[21:53:05] <codepython7771> sahbeewah: I've a search form on a page (which displays search results). When the user clicks "sort by age", I post a search back to the server. The post is simple: $.post("/search",  postData); I want the new sorted results to be displayed. The server does sort by age, and then calls render_html. But the page does not update
[21:53:51] <sahbeewah> you're using python?
[21:54:01] <codepython7771> My search view has two functions , get and post. The get just renders a search box. The post computes a result and renders it.
[21:54:03] <codepython7771> sahbeewah: indeed
[21:54:59] <sahbeewah> .post is an ajax call which asynchronously retrieves data, which means you have to manipulate it after it comes back
[21:55:04] <codepython7771> So from the results page when i post using jquery, the searchView.post function is called, python backend sorts the output on age and then calls render_html. But no output on the browser
[21:55:25] <codepython7771> sabotage: $.ajaxSetup({async:false});  -- doesnt this fix that?
[21:55:26] <sahbeewah> in your python backend, you shouldn't be rendering html, unless you want it to be a regular page
[21:55:40] <ruby_on_tails> hello
[21:55:49] <codepython7771> I do want it to be a regular page. As if someone manually typed a search query and wanted it to be sorted by age.
[21:55:49] <xboi209> how do i select a div class inside a span element?
[21:56:05] <sahbeewah> yeah
[21:56:08] <sahbeewah> then you don't need post
[21:56:11] <sahbeewah> all you need is a regular form
[21:56:13] <LindsayMac> xboi209:  a div inside of a span should not happen
[21:56:25] <xboi209> ok span inside div?
[21:56:47] <sahbeewah> there's no javascript required, just set the form action to /search
[21:56:52] <codepython7771> sahbeewah: I do have a regular form on the page. When the user clicks - Sort by age, I call a JS function that uses jquery to add "sort_by_age=True" to my hidden field, and then post this regular form using jquery
[21:56:59] <LindsayMac> xboi209:  a div inside of a span is bad coding standards
[21:57:04] <xboi209> ._.
[21:57:14] <xboi209> a element inside div?
[21:57:22] <codepython7771> sahbeewah: its the sorting that needs the JS. I do that using a hidden field in the form
[21:57:30] <LindsayMac> div > yourelement
[21:57:42] <sahbeewah> make the sort by age call the search action with a get querystring
[21:57:51] <xboi209> >.>
[21:57:55] <sahbeewah> action="/search?sort_by_age=True"
[21:58:16] <LindsayMac> xboi209:  thats your answer
[21:58:26] <sahbeewah> actually it depends on how you've set it up
[21:58:38] <xboi209> LindsayMac: ?
[21:58:57] <sahbeewah> you should be using GET for a search anyway
[21:59:06] <codepython7771> sahbeewah: My backend only traps get and post on /search.
[21:59:14] <LindsayMac> use div > yourelement
[21:59:21] <codepython7771> sahbeewah: indeed. that was code i inherited. Wrong design choice i agree.
[21:59:24] <LindsayMac> xboi209:  what are you trying to do
[21:59:51] <LindsayMac> or .children if you want
[21:59:59] <xboi209> are you saying to do $("div > body")?
[22:00:01] <codepython7771> sahbeewah: but my actions would look ugly, because i also post the last search input etc when the user clicks sort by age.
[22:00:08] <xboi209> or something like that?
[22:00:08] <LindsayMac> .find( div > span)
[22:00:13] <xboi209> oh
[22:00:30] <LindsayMac> or .children(div)
[22:00:42] <LindsayMac> http://api.jquery.com/children/
[22:00:47] <LindsayMac> http://api.jquery.com/find/
[22:00:49] <LindsayMac> xboi209:
[22:00:52] <LindsayMac> those are for you
[22:01:00] <xboi209> i know how to use google :D
[22:01:12] <sahbeewah> ok, what you can do is treat it as a normal form then. don't worry about .post(). use jquery to add the sort information into the form, then call .submit()
[22:01:13] <LindsayMac> well
[22:01:48] <codepython7771> absolutely. lemme try that
[22:03:32] * tw2113 duckduckgo's
[22:03:44] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  i think i got it acting more smoothly
[22:03:51] <tw2113> scolded it?
[22:03:54] <codepython7771> sahbeewah: You rock! :)
[22:03:59] <LindsayMac> except NOW i lost my ability to link to containers!
[22:04:17] <codepython7771> sahbeewah: That works! Why did the post not work?
[22:04:58] <sahbeewah> .post sends off an ajax call which retrieves data from your target, which you have to handle manually
[22:05:10] <sahbeewah> in most situations that means you have to return a json from python
[22:05:43] <codepython7771> even when you do $.ajaxSetup({async:false}); ?
[22:06:27] <sahbeewah> it's fundamentally still an ajax call with asynchronous flag turned false, what that does is force everything else not to do anything until the call is complete
[22:06:46] <sahbeewah> in case you need the data from the post before you do other things on the page
[22:06:54] <codepython7771> Thanks :)
[22:07:04] <codepython7771> LindsayMac: This was not totally trivial :)
[22:07:11] <codepython7771> perhaps for you guys. But not for me :)
[22:07:25] <codepython7771> Thanks for all the help.
[22:08:23] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:  do you have any thoughts on how to add the url has to ariel flieser's scrollTo?
[22:10:33] <sahbeewah> what?
[22:11:04] <LindsayMac> sahbeewah:  its almost as if as soon as i add this: window.location.hash= this.hash; i get that crazy glitchy-ness
[22:11:19] <Gambit-> so if I call $.ajax({... data: d, complete: function(res, stat) { ... } });, is it possible for the complete function to get access to either the whole ajax{}, or specifically the data field?
[22:12:02] <Gambit-> obviously complete() gets the jqXHR, but I don't know how to get the original ajax{} from that object.
[22:12:04] <LindsayMac> ya know what.. Im not going to stress about the hash updating int he browser
[22:12:58] <Gambit-> ah, it's "this", of course.
[22:13:06] <tw2113> eww hash
[22:13:10] <sahbeewah> i haven't really played around with the window location hash
[22:13:13] <LindsayMac> sometimes asking the question is the answer
[22:13:24] <sahbeewah> i assume that it would try to jump to the id
[22:13:25] <LindsayMac> ok.. but yea.. adding that is the cause of the craziness
[22:13:39] <LindsayMac> its supposed to.. yes, but that was causing the crazy glitches
[22:13:55] <tw2113> no smooth scrolling?
[22:14:25] <LindsayMac> no.. just no window.hash
[22:14:38] <hoolter> tw2113: didn't see the rest of the convo, but check this: https://github.com/nhenezi/smooth-scrolling
[22:15:04] * tw2113 mourns the moving on of a character in a decent show
[22:15:26] <LindsayMac> hoolter:  i was playing with smooth scrolling.. but im using Ariel's
[22:16:30] <LindsayMac> what's your guys' favorite lightbox plugin?
[22:17:36] <systemfault> fancybox2
[22:19:07] <LindsayMac> systemfault:  ive used prettyphoto often.. ill look at fancybox
[22:20:27] <rodd> my own
[22:39:27] <foucist> hi guys.. when i use .hide on a sidebar, it doesn't let the other divs expand to take the hidden area
[22:39:32] <foucist> any idea how to override?
[22:39:42] <tw2113> alter your css
[22:39:44] <foucist> i not only want to hide it but remove it temporarily or whatever
[22:39:56] <foucist> tw2113: i tried adding width:100% to the other div
[22:42:01] <ENQ> foucist, display:none makes other element to take its placce
[22:42:20] <ENQ> unless other is fixed by css
[22:42:38] <ENQ> and .hide should work
[22:43:42] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  is there a plugin for FF that resizes the browser window to popular screen size?
[22:43:49] <LindsayMac> i know you're the Mozilla dude
[22:44:40] <tw2113> mobile testing?
[22:44:44] <AfroTurf> if i had $(this).live("click", function() {} how do i convert that to .on I tried $(document).on("click", $(this), function() {}
[22:45:07] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  responsive testing
[22:45:12] <foucist> ENQ: yeah, dang css
[22:45:13] <tw2113> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t07cLJhJkjQ
[22:45:23] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  my browser is massive
[22:45:35] <LindsayMac> andhaving a nightly isny want I am looking to deal with right now
[22:45:48] <tw2113> i have the same tool in aurora right now
[22:46:21] <tw2113> but it is going to be a built-in tool :P
[22:46:26] <LindsayMac> yea.. i dont wanna deal with that though.
[22:46:33] <LindsayMac> im not down with alpha / beta testing
[22:46:43] <LindsayMac> especially since ight now FF is my only browser
[22:46:44] <tw2113> dunno if there's any add-ons
[22:46:47] <LindsayMac> seeing as chrome is SHOT
[22:46:56] <tw2113> oh Mountain Lion
[22:47:03] <LindsayMac> yea
[22:47:25] <tw2113> all you need is a new browser profile and you're safe
[22:47:34] <tw2113> yeah, i'm a little difficult :D
[22:47:40] <LindsayMac> no shit
[22:47:50] <tw2113> https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search/?q=responsive&appver=16.0&platform=linux
[22:48:31] <tw2113> or maybe just the webdev toolbar, create a bunch of resize options for the various dimensions
[22:49:33] <tw2113> granted just tonight, i realized that the iPhone 4S is retina
[22:50:09] <LindsayMac> Si nce when is 75% different on one child element and not another of the same level?
[22:50:15] <LindsayMac> 75% width i meant
[22:50:26] <rhino__> hey guys does a .live click event run before an actual onclick event?
[23:07:49] <sacho> no
[23:11:17] <rhizmoe> i seem to have a problem clearing a div, $('#foo').html(''), then populating it with premade spans (it's a box with rows of words). the words are rendered in a straight line off the right edge of the box
[23:14:04] * rhizmoe tries to jsfiddle
[23:14:19] <hoolter> rhizome jsfiddle blows.
[23:14:21] <hoolter> don't use it.
[23:14:40] <hoolter> rhizmoe: use jsbin instead, it's wayyyyy better.
[23:16:04] <rodd> fiddle is great
[23:16:26] <hoolter> LindsayMac: ooh, can i see?  what's Ariel's?
[23:16:40] <LindsayMac> google ScrollTo
[23:16:54] <hoolter> LindsayMac: oh, ok.  why'd you end up using that instead?
[23:17:33] <LindsayMac> because its one of the more well known ones and i've used it before
[23:17:37] <tw2113> cause she got it to work?
[23:19:24] <hoolter> tw2113: i was just wondering if there's any nice advantages to it.
[23:19:43] <tw2113> it works?
[23:20:09] <LindsayMac> hoolter:  google it.
[23:20:16] <hoolter> tw2113: so does smooth-scrolling
[23:21:14] <tw2113> so we've established it's up to preference
[23:23:53] <tw2113> WordPress needs some good iPhone wallpapers
[23:25:27] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  what?
[23:25:38] <tw2113> random thoughts
[23:44:22] <rhizmoe> jsbin, okay :)
[23:45:29] <rhizmoe> how do i jsbin a form that returns an ajax:success?
[23:45:36] <rhizmoe> #jsbin? :)
