[00:04:35] <GeekMonkey> I am trying to do a scroll to play with youtube
[00:04:36] <GeekMonkey> http://www.foftv.com/samplejs/vidscroll2.html
[00:04:56] <GeekMonkey> I see this example but what if I have multiple videos per page?
[00:08:25] <SideFX> GeekMonkey Maybe this is what you're looking for? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/487073/check-if-element-is-visible-after-scrolling
[00:10:33] <shoky_> SideFX:  data-id="..."  attribute, then fetch it with $(this).data('id')
[00:19:29] <SideFX> shoky_ can data-id be applied to any html element?
[00:34:26] <GeekMonkey> SideFX not exactly
[00:34:37] <GeekMonkey> if you look at the code for the yt video
[00:34:46] <GeekMonkey> it is using the yt api
[00:36:49] <shoky_> SideFX yep
[04:31:55] <galgamach> Hi al. Trying to upgrade to version 3 and I am getting a lot of warnings like JQMIGRATE: jQuery.fn.resize() event shorthand is deprecated.  Just to clarify this:   does this mean I need to go to every function at my code that is deprecated and change it with the ones of version 3 ?
[04:36:17] <Cork> galgamach: .resize(func) => on('resize', func)
[04:36:44] <Cork> quite a few shorthands have been removed in 3.x
[04:38:37] <galgamach> Cork, thank you.  So this means I have to change the code I wrote with the previous version right? And like you said if I wrote .resize(func) I need to change it to on('resize', func) ,  right?
[04:38:47] <Cork> yes
[04:47:26] <galgamach> Cork, thank you..!!  The documentation suggests that inspite of the warnings the code should still work and if you use the production instead of the development the warnings should still work.  Would you suggest something like that?
[04:49:18] <Cork> galgamach: it still does, this is migration warnings
[04:53:00] <galgamach> Cork, ok. What is the easiest way to use the production ?  Grunt or nom ?
[04:53:07] <galgamach> *npm
[05:06:29] <Cork> galgamach: production of what?
[05:17:56] <galgamach> Cork, production version of jQuery 3
[05:18:17] <Cork> i just fetch it from code.jquery.com
[05:52:54] <galgamach> Cork, just using CDN ?
[05:53:17] <Cork> no http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js
[05:53:41] <Cork> there are grunt versions too last i checked
[05:55:07] <Guest29537> hi i have problem jquery and josn request it do normal reqest and no xhr
[05:55:09] <Guest29537> https://paste.opensuse.org/83689470
[05:56:11] <Cork> Guest29537: 1. use submit on the from not click on the submit button
[05:56:21] <Cork> 2. use event.preventDefault() on the submit event
[05:56:25] <Cork> and then it should work
[05:56:35] <Guest29537> thank you
[05:57:04] <Cork> currently you get: 1. catch click. 2. start ajax call. 3. start form submit. 4. abort ajax call. 5. load result from form submit
[06:01:15] <Guest29537> Cork: https://paste.opensuse.org/28962631 i have change it without success
[06:01:46] <Cork> Guest29537: you're still binding it on the submit button not the form
[06:01:58] <Guest29537> ok
[06:08:07] <Guest29537> $('#logoutform').submit right ?
[06:24:53] <dimi1947> I want to target an INPUT in the DOM that has a data attribure in it....any ideas how to do it...I know must use length...but what else it is needed codewise
[06:27:01] <thykka> dimi1947, for example, if your html is <input type="text" data-custom="example"> you could select it with $('[data-custom]')
[06:27:45] <thykka> this would select any element that has a "data-custom" attribute
[06:28:16] <thykka> you say you "must use length", I don't follow, what for?
[06:28:24] <dimi1947> I will see in practice if  this truly helps..
[06:28:40] <dimi1947> I want to make some testing before experimenting
[06:29:02] <dimi1947> before commenting any further
[07:22:47] <dimi1947> does anyone know how to stop displaying in dev tools console navigation messages(navigated to...)
[07:24:21] <thykka> dimi1947, you can filter the console output
[07:24:34] <thykka> Navigation messages are categorized under "Logs"
[07:25:16] <thykka> (or "Info" in Chrome)
[07:25:21] <dimi1947> I do not see any logs otion anywhere
[07:25:44] <thykka> https://snag.gy/Golt7s.jpg
[07:30:00] <dimi1947> thanks
[07:32:58] <galgamach> Any list for jQuery 3 deprecated functions?  e.g. is find() deprecated  ?
[07:36:25] <thykka> galgamach, https://api.jquery.com/category/deprecated/
[07:36:37] <galgamach> thykka, thank you
[07:37:42] <Cork> note some of those functions exist in multiple versions, and only some of those are depricated
[07:38:31] <Cork> (like .load() and .toggle())
[07:50:33] <AdamPDotty> oh, no more .toggle()
[07:51:56] <AdamPDotty> but still toggleClass() ?
[08:28:43] <Cork> AdamPDotty: heh yes, .toggle() works too, just not .toggle(func, func, func...)
[08:38:50] <AdamPDotty> I see
[10:35:49] <Dunams> I'm trying to get the text() from a textarea in a modal, though it keeps taking only the initial value
[10:36:04] <gho_> hi, what's the best way to ajaxify a form nowadays?
[10:36:13] <gho_> e.g. serialise the fields and post it via ajax
[10:37:09] <Dunams> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/hhWlMvHQK9VtnP2bEyS1GQ
[10:37:13] <Dunams> what am I doing wrong?
[10:37:14] <shoky_> gho_: $(form).serialize() helps
[10:37:32] <gho_> Dunams, .val()
[10:37:33] <gho_> thanks
[10:39:18] <Dunams> gho_ it's not because of that
[10:39:45] <Dunams> you joined after my question which was -
[10:39:51] <Dunams> I'm trying to get the text() from a textarea in a modal, though it keeps taking only the initial value
[10:39:52] <gho_> ah man shoky_, it doesn't serialize urls properly
[10:40:23] <Dunams> If I write something in the textarea the data I'm getting is still the initial one
[10:41:26] <shoky_> gho_: what do you mean?
[10:42:15] <shoky_> Dunams: gho_ gave you the right answer
[10:42:37] <gho_> shoky_, it doesn't serialize urls in input fields properly
[10:42:45] <gho_> e.g. it doesn't encode them
[10:42:56] <MikeD_> why would you expect that it should?
[10:43:17] <gho_> because otherwise the serialization is invalid
[10:44:03] <MikeD_> input fields are text... does it serialize to text?
[10:44:31] <gho_> and the serialization is url encoded
[10:44:44] <shoky_> gho_: it encodes them fine, like it encodes any text
[10:44:52] <gho_> if it weren't clientside it'd be an injection vulnerability
[10:45:10] <MikeD_> are you saying input type="url" ?
[10:45:56] <shoky_> it encodes with url-encoding
[10:46:26] <gho_> it's a hidden field

[14:23:56] <taplar> zzZZzzZZ
[14:24:06] <robertmaxrees> same
[14:46:56] <robertmaxrees> dang spambots.
[14:47:13] <taplar> ?
[14:47:24] <taplar> you getting pm'ed or something?
[14:47:37] <robertmaxrees> PMS notified me on join with a message.
[14:47:45] <robertmaxrees> annoying.
[15:02:45] <grapheti> We all suffer from a little PMS.
[15:03:06] <taplar> ahhh, i thought we avoided that joke
[15:04:19] <grapheti> taking bad jokes away from me #jquery
[15:04:21] <Gh0st_Preacher> hrm?
[15:04:33] <grapheti> I see how it is.
[16:54:37] <hillct> Good afternoon all. Is there a promise style method like .then (which seems not to work here) for assuring that when triggering events, all handlers complete, before the next event in my sequence is fired?
[16:55:01] <robertmaxrees> "seems not to work here"?
[16:56:01] <robertmaxrees> hillct could you expand a little more?
[16:56:47] <hillct> @robertmaxrees $(“#whatever”).trigger(‘click’).then(function(){ $(“#OtherThing”).trigger(‘click’); }
[16:56:52] <hillct> fails
[16:56:59] <robertmaxrees> so 2 things.
[16:57:01] <hillct> says then doesn’t exist
[16:57:13] <hillct> guess I’m calling it incorrectly
[16:57:14] <robertmaxrees> yeah, because .on() doesn't return a referred.
[16:57:16] <robertmaxrees> *deferred
[16:57:32] <robertmaxrees> what all is happening in the .click() handler?
[16:57:34] <hillct> what approach would you suggest?
[16:58:02] <robertmaxrees> brb 1 sec.
[16:58:14] <hillct> I’m setting some classes, and boubling up some other events. The next eent I trigger expects all those classes to be in place, and boubled events completed
[16:59:02] <hillct> sleeping a few miliseconds seems lame. I trust there’s a more ‘correct’ approach
[16:59:18] <robertmaxrees> okay back.
[16:59:25] <robertmaxrees> hillct sorry, missed what you said.
[16:59:31] <robertmaxrees> what's going on in the click handler?
[16:59:46] <hillct> I’m setting some classes, and boubling up some other events. The next eent I trigger expects all those classes to be in place, and boubled events completed
[16:59:47] <hillct> [4:58pm]
[17:00:05] <robertmaxrees> those should all be synchronous.
[17:00:16] <robertmaxrees> so you shouldn't need to wait.
[17:00:17] <hillct> nothing that takes should pose a big timing issue
[17:00:36] <robertmaxrees> any reason why this extra code isn't in the handler itself?
[17:00:44] <robertmaxrees> that's generally how you handle those.
[17:00:54] <hillct> well, sometihng is putting me in a race condition. Maybe I missed something else…
[17:01:07] <robertmaxrees> are you doing anything with ajax?
[17:01:47] <hillct> no ajax. Just setting a couple classes, seeking the element having that class, taking some action, or if nto found, addind a new element, having the target class
[17:02:26] <robertmaxrees> so what were you doing before that showed a race?
[17:02:31] <hillct> in fact, you can take a look at it here http://jsbin.com/riwaye/edit?html,js,console,output
[17:02:46] <hillct> not all in one handler, to avoid duplication
[17:02:50] <robertmaxrees> erm, wait.
[17:02:50] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:02:58] <robertmaxrees> heh?
[17:03:09] <robertmaxrees> woops - so you havemultiple handlers on the same elements?
[17:03:10] <robertmaxrees> or what?
[17:03:21] <hillct> you can click on a segment, or drag the handled around, clickin on a segment allows you to then click one of the type buttons to set a segment type
[17:04:22] <robertmaxrees> looks like you might need to break out your logic a little differently.
[17:04:24] <hillct> no, I have conditionals where if a handler on the ‘type’ buttons can’t find an ‘editing’ class, it then adds an element hacing that class, by triggering the add segment button
[17:04:41] <hillct> then attempts again to set the type of the new segment
[17:04:48] <robertmaxrees> instead of calling .trigger() manually.
[17:04:58] <robertmaxrees> call the logic itself.
[17:05:06] <hillct> Could duplicate the ode slightly, I guess, and resolve this
[17:05:16] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't need to duplicated anything.
[17:05:20] <hillct> just hping ot minimize code duplication
[17:05:21] <robertmaxrees> jsut make functions for code you repeat.
[17:05:38] <hillct> yeah
[17:05:42] <hillct> easy enough
[17:05:46] <robertmaxrees> bam, no duplication :)
[17:05:55] <hillct> just seemed like it should work sanely
[17:06:32] <hillct> so figured I might have missed some obvious, but as you say, that’s obvious… just less elegent
[17:06:33] <robertmaxrees> it does :)
[17:07:21] <robertmaxrees> i mean, it's elegant to me.
[17:07:36] <robertmaxrees> most jquery methods return jquery objects.
[17:10:13] <hillct> @robertmaxrees yes, jQuery is elegant in it’s own way; easily chainable, etc…
[17:10:26] <robertmaxrees> yep!
[17:16:25] <GeekMonkey> Hey all
[17:16:39] <GeekMonkey> When I do this $("#player1").get(0).play();
[17:16:42] <GeekMonkey> it works
[17:16:54] <GeekMonkey> but when I do $("#"+playerID).get(0).play(); it says play is not a function
[17:17:12] <GeekMonkey> Any thoughts?
[17:18:18] <robertmaxrees> console.log(playerID);
[17:18:20] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[17:20:31] <GeekMonkey> player1_html5
[17:20:41] <robertmaxrees> so there's your issue.
[17:20:57] <robertmaxrees> "player1" != "player1_html5"
[17:21:14] <Robdgreat> "the computer should know what I meant"
[17:21:20] <robertmaxrees> hah
[17:22:25] <Robdgreat> http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20011121
[17:22:27] <GeekMonkey> mediaelement.js changes it
[17:22:29] <Robdgreat> to wit:
[17:24:56] <GeekMonkey> https://codepen.io/rsmm/live/6f14f50cc90306e7068e82f8c4b4ce8d
[17:25:22] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:25:44] <GeekMonkey> robermaxrees if you want to see the rest of the code
[17:25:49] <GeekMonkey> that is what I am working on
[17:25:55] <GeekMonkey> https://codepen.io/rsmm/pen/6f14f50cc90306e7068e82f8c4b4ce8d?editors=1010
[17:26:01] <robertmaxrees> did you need more help?
[17:26:50] <robertmaxrees> wait...
[17:27:05] <robertmaxrees> var playerID = $(this).attr('id');
[17:27:12] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing that and then $('#'+playerID).mediaelementplayer({
[17:27:13] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:27:41] <robertmaxrees> why not just $(this).mediaelementplayer({
[17:29:09] <GeekMonkey> for possible multiple videos
[17:29:14] <GeekMonkey> or is there another way
[17:29:18] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:29:22] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:29:39] <robertmaxrees> you're already doing an each on everthing with this class.
[17:30:00] <robertmaxrees> or are you expecting $('#' + playerID) to match multiple elements?
[17:32:05] <GeekMonkey> ya
[17:32:09] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:32:10] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:32:11] <robertmaxrees> can't.
[17:32:20] <robertmaxrees> IDs can only match 1 element.
[17:32:25] <GeekMonkey> what is the best way to do this then
[17:32:27] <robertmaxrees> can't repeat IDs on a page, in fact.
[17:32:30] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[17:32:44] <GeekMonkey> to have multple instances and have it play when it enters the viewport
[17:32:54] <robertmaxrees> have to use classes for that.
[17:32:57] <robertmaxrees> can't use IDs.
[17:32:59] <GeekMonkey> they would each have a different id
[17:33:07] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:33:27] <robertmaxrees> use classes instead heh.
[17:33:31] <robertmaxrees> make your life easy.
[17:33:53] <robertmaxrees> your init is redundant is what I'm saying.
[17:37:00] <GeekMonkey> so how do I target each elemet?
[17:37:09] <robertmaxrees> you already are.
[17:37:09] <GeekMonkey> each video player
[17:37:13] <robertmaxrees> $('.vidplayer').each(function() {
[17:37:18] <robertmaxrees> $(this) in that is the video player.
[17:38:27] <robertmaxrees> var playerID = $(this).attr('id'); is saying "get me the id of the current element", then you do $('#'+playerID).mediaelementplayer({
[17:38:34] <GeekMonkey> so now I have two play now buttons.... try to target the element through the id to play it
[17:38:35] <robertmaxrees> which is strange, because you can't only use an ID once per page.
[17:38:39] <GeekMonkey> I fixed that
[17:38:46] <GeekMonkey> the first buttons works but not the second
[17:39:04] <robertmaxrees> are you talking about your scroll logic?f
[17:39:55] <GeekMonkey> ok got the buttons working.... under the video.... it was the ID class issue
[17:40:01] <robertmaxrees> aight.
[17:40:09] <GeekMonkey> now trying to fix the scroll logic
[17:40:25] <robertmaxrees> var playerID = $(this).attr('id'); if ($("#"+playerID).isInViewport()) { ?
[17:40:31] <robertmaxrees> that's the same case.
[17:40:39] <robertmaxrees> you're selecting an object you've already got.
[17:44:44] <GeekMonkey> not working
[17:45:00] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[17:45:16] <GeekMonkey> play video when in viewport
[17:45:16] <robertmaxrees> mind showing me the code?
[17:45:26] <GeekMonkey> https://codepen.io/rsmm/pen/6f14f50cc90306e7068e82f8c4b4ce8d?editors=1010
[17:45:27] <robertmaxrees> ^ this is what
[17:45:30] <robertmaxrees> sec.
[17:45:40] <robertmaxrees> and that's not working?
[17:45:54] <robertmaxrees> was it working before, either?
[17:46:15] <GeekMonkey> the videos load, and the play button underneath videos load
[17:46:31] <robertmaxrees> but the scroll handler doesn't?
[17:46:33] <GeekMonkey> but never the scroll.... unless I hard code it with the id
[17:46:54] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so it sounds like the class doesn't work any more then?
[17:47:15] <GeekMonkey> if I do $('#player1').get(0).play(); it works
[17:48:20] <robertmaxrees> not seeing that as an ID in the page.
[17:49:19] <GeekMonkey> <mediaelementwrapper id="player1">
[17:49:40] <robertmaxrees> $('.vidplayer').each(function() {
[17:49:47] <robertmaxrees> these elements do not have the ID you're mentioning.
[17:53:22] <GeekMonkey> I got it
[17:53:41] <GeekMonkey> I ended up doing this $('.mejs__video').each(function() {
[17:53:50] <GeekMonkey> var playerID = $(this).find('mediaelementwrapper').attr('id');
[17:53:59] <GeekMonkey> $('#'+playerID).get(0).play();
[17:54:36] <robertBusy> why not just $(this).find('mediaelementwrapper').get(0).play() ?
[17:55:22] <GeekMonkey> I guess that would work too
[17:55:25] <robertBusy> heh
[17:56:31] <GeekMonkey> Anyone know why when I add this option startLanguage: 'en' it scrolls down to the element
[21:23:54] <mrush> i dont suppose jquery provides a method to calculate the width of an element not yet added to the dom?
[21:25:34] <mrush> seems inelegant to calculate it in an off-screen div
[23:48:38] <jayjo_> I am using input:checked:first + label to style the first element that is selected in a list. But after the first checked element changes the class remains on the no longer first item. What's the best way to remove that class after it changes? (this class should never be on more than 1 element)
