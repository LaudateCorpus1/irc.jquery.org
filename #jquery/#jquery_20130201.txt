[00:30:50] <pingec> I have a collection of li elements. How can I filter this down to only li elements that have a <span> child and this span contains "loading" text?
[00:38:21] <anli__> Is there a jquery function for getting form variables and put in an object so I can send it with $.post?
[00:38:28] <anli__> Using ajax instead
[00:40:46] <gdbz> pingec: $.each($('li span'), function(i, item){ if ( $(item).html()=='loading'){console.log('found')} else { console.log('false');} })
[00:42:20] <gdbz> anli__: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1184624/convert-form-data-to-js-object-with-jquery
[00:42:28] <anli__> thx
[00:42:34] <anli__> I was writing a func now :)
[00:42:39] <gdbz> =)
[00:42:54] <anli__> Maybe I find a better one in the so page
[00:43:08] <gdbz> Maybe =)
[00:43:58] <greg5green> anli__, ive only seen writing your own if you dont want them serialized
[00:44:06] <greg5green> put all of them in an object
[00:44:21] <anli__> yeah, well, I want to feed $.post with it, so its just an obj
[00:45:16] <greg5green> yeah, its pretty easy
[00:45:50] <greg5green> then you can just put a param of
[00:46:07] <greg5green> data: yourobj in your $.ajax method
[00:46:59] <greg5green> I've only tried to read the results in PHP endpoint and its easy there
[00:47:06] <greg5green> id assume its easy for other languages as well
[00:48:22] <bahamas> hello. I'm using jquery to send a POST request, but the X_REQUESTED_WITH header isn't set and my backend doesn't see it as an AJAX request. any idea what I'm doing wrong?
[00:48:47] <anli__> Hm, I have form variables containing period
[00:49:19] <litenull> anli__: did you consider encoding in json the data
[00:49:19] <anli__> Is that a problem maybe
[00:49:32] <anli__> hm, have not considered that
[00:49:39] <anli__> Can mvc take that input?
[00:49:45] <greg5green> anli__, encodeURI
[00:49:46] <anli__> Maybe I can parse it myself
[00:50:12] <litenull> you should parse it in object then
[00:50:12] <greg5green> there should be a decodeURI in your language of choice
[00:50:27] <anli__> So I cannot use period then, I take it
[00:50:42] <discorpia> bahamas: using any plugins?
[00:50:48] <discorpia> bahamas: like ajaxForms or similar
[00:51:11] <greg5green> anli__, i dont think you can use it like that, but im not sure off the top of my head
[00:51:21] <bahamas> discorpia: not that I'm aware
[00:51:36] <discorpia> bahamas: using any file upload fields or similar?
[00:51:40] <discorpia> in the form
[00:52:06] <resting> is there a supported js templating framework for jquery?
[00:53:30] <discorpia> resting: mustach/handlebars could be of interest, they stopped developing jquery-tmpl so there is no native templating afaik
[00:53:34] <bahamas> discorpia: I'm sending a single field http://jsfiddle.net/kxL77/
[00:53:50] <Cork> anli__: a valid query contains *( "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")" / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "/" / "?" / "=" )
[00:54:06] <Cork> anli__: all other characters has to be escaped
[00:54:48] <bahamas> discorpia: btw, the unusual thing is that the form doesn't use a submit input field but a html5 button tag. I don't know if that's relevant
[00:55:12] <Cork> opps missed "%" in there
[00:55:39] <resting> discorpia: i thought so too. hmâ€¦but the team doesn't want to add more additional libraries to the already bloated GUIâ€¦thanksâ€¦may have to drop the idea of a templating system and go manual :s
[00:56:35] <discorpia> resting: handlebars.js is very nice, standalone and minimal/doesn't add much overhead to any code
[00:57:39] <discorpia> bahamas: hmm, can't find anything about button element affecting that though
[00:57:44] <greg5green> bahamas, that isn't something that is requested by default
[00:57:50] <resting> discorpia: yeah i tried itâ€¦much cleaner codesâ€¦hmâ€¦.i'm not sure if i want to spend the effort convincing them lol..
[00:57:54] <greg5green> bahamas, err, send by default
[00:57:59] <bahamas> greg5green: what is/isn't?
[00:58:07] <greg5green> X_REQUESTED_WITH
[00:58:16] <resting> parting because i'm new to it too..and can't really contribute much if we were to use it
[00:58:58] <discorpia> resting: you could write a jquery handlebars plugin/wrapper and say it's jquery :D
[00:59:08] <discorpia> greg5green: hmm, isn't that header always added?
[00:59:13] <greg5green> no
[00:59:17] <litenull> resting: i have checked all the mainstream templating enignes
[00:59:20] <litenull> engines*
[00:59:21] <greg5green> some frameworks add it
[00:59:31] <resting> discorpia: lol...
[00:59:31] <litenull> and every one of them lacks something, like partials, etc
[00:59:45] <greg5green> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js, if you notice, no mention of it
[00:59:51] <litenull> so use the most supported, if you really want to use a template engine
[00:59:54] <bahamas> greg5green: so jquery doesn't set it automatically?
[00:59:59] <bahamas> I see
[01:00:04] <greg5green> not to my knowledge anyways
[01:00:38] <bahamas> why isn't it set by default? it is the default, in my mind
[01:00:49] <greg5green> because it isnt really needed
[01:00:57] <greg5green> why the extra bits?
[01:01:13] <resting> litenull: hahaâ€¦coolâ€¦guess its down to only 1 choiceâ€¦handlebarsâ€¦.
[01:01:28] <bahamas> greg5green: ah, yes. you have a point
[01:01:46] <Cork> greg5green: no x-requested_with is set by XMLHTTPRequest
[01:01:56] <Cork> frameworks might want to overide it, but its there by default
[01:02:06] <litenull> resting: i think it doesnt have partials (include file).. im not sure, but its ok
[01:02:06] <Cork> X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
[01:02:12] <litenull> :)
[01:02:44] <bahamas> anyway, in this case the header checked by my framework is HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH, so I probably need to set it myself
[01:02:45] <resting> :)
[01:03:12] <bahamas> it's weird, because on other pages it was working just fine
[01:03:33] <Cork> thats just the rewrite apache does
[01:04:02] <Cork> make a tcp dump of the trafic and you'll see that those two match
[01:04:10] <Cork> Ä*traffic
[01:04:33] <Cork> X-Requested-With is very important cause that is what servers use to identify ajax calls
[01:06:56] <bahamas> Cork: I'm not using Apache. is that done by all servers?
[01:07:34] <Cork> bahamas: depends on what interface/language is used
[01:08:04] <Cork> the real value is X-Request-With and has nothing to do with what the server does
[01:08:29] <Cork> some servers just like to prefix it
[01:08:39] <guzzlefry> Does it matter if I use $(document) vs. $('document')?
[01:08:48] <Cork> to identify what headers came from the http and what came from the server
[01:08:54] <Cork> guzzlefry: yes
[01:09:00] <guzzlefry> how so?
[01:09:05] <Cork> document isn't an element so you can't select on that
[01:09:12] <Cork> $('document') that is
[01:09:17] <guzzlefry> ah okay
[01:09:25] <guzzlefry> the code still seems to work...
[01:09:42] <Cork> its a psudo pointer that means something similar to <html>
[01:09:58] <guzzlefry> but it could just be executing immediately instead or waiting for it to be ready.
[01:10:01] <Cork> and document is faster as it doesn't have to do selection for it
[01:10:16] <guzzlefry> does $(this) need quotes?
[01:10:30] <Cork> it can't have quotes; for the same reason as document
[01:10:34] <Cork> and window
[01:10:38] <Cork> and any other variable you use
[01:10:44] <DavidSullivan> at that point this is an object
[01:10:52] <bahamas> Cork: weird. I don't see that header in the request headers in Firebug
[01:13:15] <noregret> if i want to check if a vaar in undefined, is if( v == 'undefined' ) fine ?
[01:14:32] <swe_ET> remove quotes
[01:14:44] <swe_ET> if ( v === undefined) even
[01:16:15] <Cork> noregret: typeof(v)
[01:16:22] <litenull> typeof +1
[01:16:36] <Cork> swe_ET: you can only do === if the left side is a member of an object
[01:16:59] <Cork> js> var o = {}; print(o.none === undefined);
[01:17:02] <b-ot> Cork: true
[01:17:11] <Cork> js> print(o === undefined);
[01:17:13] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[01:17:22] <Cork> ?eval print(o === undefined);
[01:17:27] <bot-t> Cork: ReferenceError: o is not defined
[01:17:37] <Cork> ?eval var o = {}; print(o.none === undefined);
[01:17:38] <bot-t> Cork: true
[01:18:14] <greg5green> bahamas, i'm puzzled as well. I even went to the trouble of sniffing for that header, and it didnt show up
[01:19:44] <noregret> Cork: typeof didn't work out for me when the var is not an object
[01:20:05] <Cork> ?eval print(typeof(o) === 'undefined');
[01:20:06] <bot-t> Cork: true
[01:20:08] <litenull> did you put undefined in brackets ?
[01:20:12] <Cork> noregret: should work just fine
[01:20:17] <noregret> ah, didn't put quotes
[01:20:26] <litenull> quotes sorry :D
[01:20:27] <litenull> lol
[01:20:28] <Cork> ?eval print(typeof(o));
[01:20:29] <bot-t> Cork: "undefined"
[01:20:40] <Cork> so ya it gives you a string to compare
[01:21:01] <seutje> ?eval print(typeof(NaN));
[01:21:02] <bot-t> seutje: "number"
[01:21:06] <seutje> ghegheghe :P
[01:21:10] <Cork> love that one :)
[01:21:15] <seutje> everyone does
[01:21:22] <Cork> ?eval typeof(null);
[01:21:23] <bot-t> Cork: "object"
[01:21:38] <litenull> classic
[01:22:02] <swe_ET> ?eval print(typeof(undefined));
[01:22:03] <bot-t> swe_ET: "undefined"
[01:22:05] <Cork> ?eval typeof([]);
[01:22:06] <bot-t> Cork: "object"
[01:22:39] <bahamas> greg5green: so apparently it's not set all the time
[01:22:52] <Cork> ?eval print(null == undefined); print(typeof(null) == 'undefined');
[01:22:53] <bot-t> Cork: truefalse
[01:23:01] <Cork> ?eval print(null == undefined); print(' '); print(typeof(null) == 'undefined');
[01:23:02] <bot-t> Cork: true" "false
[01:23:30] <swe_ET> ?eval print(null === undefined);
[01:23:30] <bot-t> swe_ET: false
[01:23:33] <greg5green> bahamas, from all I can tell from sniffing packets on multiple browsers and doing a little quick reading, nope.
[01:23:46] <bahamas> Cork: do you have any idea why the header wouldn't be set all the time?
[01:23:54] <marcules> Morning
[01:24:04] <Cork> bahamas: never experienced that it wasn't so...
[01:24:12] <litenull> its always set imo
[01:24:18] <Cork> at least not when i've needed it
[01:24:19] <litenull> there is something else
[01:24:23] <bahamas> Cork: ok, I'll do some more digging
[01:24:41] <Cork> bahamas: though ya, i was wrong when digging a bit
[01:24:53] <Cork> its sat by frameworks not browser core
[01:25:21] <Cork> jquery does it on line ~ 8422
[01:25:44] <Cork> and it has an exception for crossDomain calls
[01:26:03] <Cork> (witch i never use as its not cross browser supported)
[01:26:49] <greg5green> ah
[01:27:01] <greg5green> that explains why i didnt see it, i was working on something that was making a jsonp request
[01:27:07] <greg5green> and thats what i sniffed
[01:27:11] <greg5green> check another project, its there
[01:27:23] <Cork> ah, jsonp isn't ajax so that explains that
[01:27:35] <greg5green> sure it is
[01:27:42] <Cork> no its <script src=""> requests
[01:27:52] <Cork> you can't do jsonp with ajax
[01:28:03] <Cork> as in XMLHTTPRequests
[01:28:19] <Cork> $.ajax creates <script> tags and attaches them to head for jsonp calls
[01:30:18] <Cork> and thats why you can only do GET calls for jsonp
[01:30:25] <bahamas> Cork: so, for some reason, jquery isn't setting that header
[01:30:39] <Cork> bahamas: it can't set it for script tag loads
[01:30:58] <Cork> it can only set headers on XMLHTTPRequests calls
[01:31:35] <DansVC> oi
[01:31:43] <DansVC> hello
[01:31:56] <DansVC> someone are here?
[01:32:39] <greg5green> cork, i agree with you on that matter, if you are referring to ajax as only traditional xmlhttprequests
[01:33:24] <Cork> greg5green: ya, i don't mean ajax as in broader term with interactive webpage
[01:33:40] <Cork> cause i think that would include just moving things around on a webpage
[01:33:48] <greg5green> no
[01:33:52] <greg5green> of course
[01:33:57] <greg5green> technically nothing with json is ajax either
[01:33:58] <greg5green> so...
[01:34:00] <greg5green> ;)
[01:34:12] <greg5green> if you go by the name anyways
[01:34:20] <bahamas> Cork: yes, I'm talking about my case, not jsonp
[01:34:23] <Cork> greg5green: well ya, as the xml response doens't have xml tags, you have a point
[01:34:37] <Cork> bahamas: can you make a testcase then?
[01:34:51] <DansVC> How I make a appear a iframe and src in that iframe
[01:35:07] <greg5green> bahamas, do you have it set to be crossdomain in the settings?
[01:35:20] <DansVC> and when I click in other link append other iframe
[01:36:06] <DansVC> someone know?
[01:36:21] <greg5green> because even if you are making an xml call or json call and have it set to true for crossdomain, it will omit that header
[01:36:50] <Cork> well not omit, if you set it it will still send it
[01:36:55] <Cork> it just won't add it it self
[01:36:58] <brantje> DansVC
[01:37:00] <greg5green> yes
[01:37:04] <brantje> i don't understand you
[01:37:07] <greg5green> wont set it itself unless you set it
[01:37:09] <DansVC> ok
[01:37:21] <brantje> change the url of the iframe?
[01:37:37] <Cork> i suspect he want to talk cross iframes
[01:37:48] <Cork> at lest thats the only thing i can parse that too
[01:37:53] <greg5green> the first time i read it, i assumed he just wanted to change the url of the iframe
[01:38:01] <brantje> looks more like google translate
[01:38:02] <greg5green> but second time, i assumed talk across iframes as well
[01:38:16] <DansVC> I was creating operative sistem: append Iframe with a src if I click in one link and have other iframe when i click in other link
[01:38:30] <brantje> since when can an iframe access it parent?
[01:38:31] <Cork> O_o'
[01:38:42] <Cork> brantje: sane dinaub
[01:38:42] <greg5green> postMessage
[01:38:45] <Cork> *domain
[01:38:54] <brantje> ahh
[01:38:55] <Cork> well postMessage isn't accessing its parent
[01:39:09] <Cork> you can send postMessages to ANY open page in the browser
[01:39:10] <greg5green> it can send a message that the parent can be listening for
[01:39:22] <Cork> ya, but your not accessing it
[01:39:43] <Cork> its like when i send an email to you; i'm not accessing your mailbox, i just send a mail to you
[01:40:04] <bahamas> greg5green: I'm not messing with the jquery settings at all
[01:40:16] <Cork> bahamas: so a testcase
[01:40:19] <greg5green> yes
[01:40:27] <greg5green> yes cork, i misread that
[01:40:36] <greg5green> access its parent/vs talk to its parent
[01:40:38] <bahamas> Cork: a test case? what would that consist of?
[01:40:54] <Cork> bahamas: a jsfiddle that reproduces the problem
[01:41:11] <Cork> preferably with < 50 lines of code
[01:41:15] <brantje> I did party too hard last night
[01:41:21] <brantje> wasted as f
[01:41:32] <greg5green> either send a link of the whole project, or compartmentalize your problem into a smaller little project that is easy to share on jsfiddle
[01:41:35] <greg5green> the latter is preferred
[01:41:39] <brantje> I have to contine on my project :x
[01:42:03] <greg5green> brantje
[01:42:04] <greg5green> just
[01:42:05] <greg5green> work
[01:42:06] <brantje> yea
[01:42:08] <brantje> xD
[01:42:09] <greg5green> slooooowwwwww
[01:42:10] <greg5green> :D
[01:42:13] <brantje> ghehe
[01:42:14] <Cork> ya, digging through a full project can be a mess, and you can't modify it to test the problems
[01:42:18] <brantje> Its my own project
[01:42:24] <brantje> So doesn't matter :)
[01:42:42] <greg5green> i meant moreso that you will make less errors today if you try to do less work
[01:42:56] <brantje> ghehe :p
[01:43:02] <Cork> greg5green: that depends on who you talk to
[01:43:11] <brantje> yea monday bugfix's >_<
[01:43:20] <Cork> i know a few developers that code better when they are slightly drunk :)
[01:43:28] <brantje> Ghehe
[01:43:31] <greg5green> yes, but not leftover drunk from the day before :P
[01:43:37] <brantje> :P
[01:43:38] <Cork> true
[01:43:40] <greg5green> thats just this weird sleepy/zombie drunk
[01:43:53] <brantje> like coding till 3 am
[01:45:32] <marcules> Last week I coded from 18:00 o'clock to 6 o'clock - best code ever :D
[01:45:35] <greg5green> you guys know about ballmers peak, right?
[01:45:36] <greg5green> http://xkcd.com/323/
[01:46:07] <Cork> heh
[01:46:10] <Cork> yup
[01:46:20] <brantje> whahaha
[01:46:21] <brantje> nice
[01:46:26] <brantje> didn't know that
[01:47:16] <brantje> So that's uhm about 1 glass beer?
[01:48:02] <greg5green> a glass of beer is roughly .02 for the average 180-185 pound male
[01:48:29] <greg5green> (i've found it to be a much lower BAC than they say in the cartoon though :P)
[01:48:48] <brantje> The Ballmer peak is exactly at 0.1337% (as stated by Randall Munroe in a talk at Google). Another subtle hint that it's a joke :)
[01:48:56] <brantje> http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/2795/is-the-ballmer-peak-real
[01:49:04] <greg5green> yes
[01:49:04] <greg5green> :)
[01:49:07] <brantje> So is it true of not?
[01:49:07] <greg5green> i mean
[01:49:18] <greg5green> i've found it to be a little true
[01:49:24] <greg5green> but more like .04-.05
[01:49:38] <brantje> I've got some tequilla in de fridge
[01:49:54] <greg5green> i mean, .1337 is like 7 beers in an hour
[01:50:12] <greg5green> im guessing it works better when you start from sober :P
[01:50:30] <greg5green> i think a nap would be more useful for you
[01:51:00] <brantje> hehe :p
[01:51:29] <brantje> btw
[01:51:40] <brantje> if i use $(document).tooltip()
[01:51:48] <brantje> it doesn't work
[01:52:02] <greg5green> did you load the plugin that makes the .tooltip() method?
[01:52:21] <brantje> Have content loaded via ajax, can that be an problem?
[01:52:36] <brantje> its default in jquery ui
[01:52:51] <greg5green> did you load jquery ui?
[01:52:56] <brantje> yes
[01:52:56] <greg5green> whats does the console say?
[01:53:32] <brantje> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'createDocumentFragment' of null
[01:54:12] <Cork> brantje: ya cause document isn't a child of document :)
[01:54:29] <Cork> $() defaults to checking on document
[01:54:40] <greg5green> hah
[01:54:49] <brantje> like this
[01:54:49] <brantje> $().tooltip();
[01:54:56] <Cork> or rather most extensions expect that
[01:55:02] <greg5green> i was about to say i didnt want to get into the wormhole here since its 5am on the east coast of the us
[01:55:03] <Cork> that won't work i think
[01:55:41] <Cork> document is a very special object, so you can't treat it as a dom element
[01:55:47] <Cork> (as it actually is the dom)
[01:55:52] <brantje> ahh
[01:56:16] <brantje> and $('body').tooltip();
[01:56:22] <Cork> that should work
[01:56:35] <Cork> unless what the plugin does with body doens't work
[01:56:38] <Cork> like wrap it
[01:56:42] <Cork> or similar
[01:56:54] <brantje> nope
[01:57:32] <brantje> Doesn't work
[01:57:42] <Cork> still get the same error?
[01:57:54] <brantje> No error, tooltips doesn't show up
[01:58:06] <Cork> well that isn't totally unexpected
[01:58:28] <Cork> if you can make an example we could look at it
[01:58:38] <Cork> preferably with an uncompressed version of the plugin
[01:58:53] <brantje> its just jqueryui
[01:59:04] <Cork> it has a tooltip nowdays?
[01:59:06] <brantje> http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/
[01:59:16] <Cork> oook
[01:59:21] <Cork> that finnaly landed
[01:59:25] <Cork> about time
[01:59:36] <brantje> $( document ).tooltip({
[01:59:36] <brantje>       track: true
[01:59:36] <brantje>     });
[01:59:52] <brantje> in the example they use document
[01:59:58] <Cork> one sec
[02:00:00] <brantje> when i use that, i get errors
[02:00:06] <Cork> let me check what that plugin does
[02:00:26] <brantje> i have jquery-ui-1.10.0
[02:01:13] <Cork> .closest( this.options.items );
[02:01:21] <Cork> that won't work on body
[02:01:35] <brantje> look at their example
[02:01:51] <Cork> O_o'
[02:02:08] <Cork> ook, so they special case that
[02:02:25] <Cork> brantje: could you post what you get problem with on jsfiddle?
[02:02:45] <brantje> i can give you the test account
[02:02:56] <brantje> since content is ajax loaded and such
[02:04:58] <Cork> ah, they use event.target
[02:05:02] <Cork> missed that
[02:07:01] <greg5green> brantje, if you accounted for it, this will sound like a dumb question
[02:07:16] <greg5green> but did you set up event handlers before or after you ajaxed in the content?
[02:07:24] <greg5green> and if you set it up after, did you use event delegation?
[02:07:32] <Cork> greg5green: doesn't matter tooltip is delegated
[02:07:36] <greg5green> k
[02:07:46] <greg5green> wasn't looking through source, but though id ask :/
[02:07:48] <Cork> <Cork> ah, they use event.target <-- thats what this means
[02:08:18] <Cork> adajad: stop changin nick every 10 seconds....
[02:08:33] <adajad> I am?
[02:08:38] <greg5green> yeah, didnt put 2 and 2 together
[02:08:54] <adajad> stupid ISP
[02:08:55] <Cork> * adajad is now known as adajad|afk | * adajad|afk is now known as adajad | * adajad is now known as adajad|afk | * adajad|afk is now known as adajad | * adajad is now known as adajad|afk | * adajad|afk is now known as adajad
[02:08:56] <Cork> and so on
[02:09:07] <greg5green> probably just getting disconnected from bnc
[02:09:32] <Cork> then disable the nick change in the bouncer
[02:09:34] <brantje> Coffee :)
[02:09:40] <adajad> thanks for letting me know, though
[02:10:16] <Cork> wow...
[02:10:19] <brantje> whoops
[02:10:41] <greg5green> whatd you do
[02:10:48] <Cork> adajad: heh, np; nice to actually get a reaction from yelling if irritation :)
[02:10:54] <brantje> i did nothing
[02:10:56] <Cork> if==of
[02:10:58] <adajad> bnc updated
[02:10:59] <adajad> :)
[02:11:01] <greg5green> surrrrrre brantje
[02:11:28] <Cork> normally its just continues hour out and hour in (not you specifically in anyway)
[02:13:07] <adajad> you won't see any more nick changes
[02:13:08] <adajad> I hate it myself, when it happens
[02:13:23] <greg5green> all my years on efnet led me to ignore it
[02:13:28] <adajad> even though I have server messages in a seperate window
[02:13:43] <adajad> keepin chat window clean
[02:14:14] <Cork> adajad: i usually keep them in the relevant window for support reasons
[02:14:32] <Cork> way to many newbies join a channel and wait for "how can i help you" :=)
[02:14:38] <greg5green> yup
[02:14:43] <adajad> heh
[02:14:45] <greg5green> especially the sass/compass channels
[02:14:51] <greg5green> much smaller channels
[02:15:05] <greg5green> ask a question, 8hr later, someone has a great response for you, but you went offline
[02:15:29] <Cork> greg5green: my fav is ppl that expects an answer to a question in < 15 sec
[02:15:35] <adajad> have any of you tested this plugin? http://plugins.jquery.com/idle/
[02:15:56] <greg5green> no
[02:16:06] <Cork> i think i helped someone that used it a little while back
[02:16:11] <greg5green> cork, yes, it's the worst "is no one here? what the hell?"
[02:16:12] <Cork> wasn't very impressed with it though
[02:16:23] <Cork> greg5green: no they join
[02:16:31] <adajad> I just need a simple idle check on a kiosk app
[02:16:34] <Cork> stay quiet for a bout 1 min to 3 mins
[02:16:47] <Cork> then ask a long quite complicated question
[02:16:52] <Cork> you start looking for an answer
[02:16:54] <Cork> they quit
[02:17:06] <Cork> mibbit users is notorious for this
[02:17:12] <greg5green> cork, think you and i are talking about the same thing
[02:17:23] <Cork> greg5green: basically
[02:17:27] <greg5green> just slightly different user behavior
[02:17:32] <Cork> just i normally don't see the response you talked about :)
[02:17:45] <Cork> they are just gone when you come back with an answer
[02:17:46] <greg5green> only place ive seen it is #sass
[02:17:52] <greg5green> mostly because no one says anything there
[02:17:58] <greg5green> so ten hours later, what they said was only 60 lines up
[02:18:14] <Cork> i've been in support channels where mibbit users is actually baned cause of this common pattern :)
[02:18:47] <greg5green> whats mibbit?
[02:18:53] <Cork> ?g mibbit
[02:18:57] <bot-t> Cork, Mibbit chat network - https://www.mibbit.com/
[02:19:08] <Cork> its a webbased irc client
[02:19:23] <greg5green> oh, that sounds awful
[02:19:36] <greg5green> hell, i dont even like this client
[02:19:44] <greg5green> used to use ircn when i was on windows
[02:19:50] <Cork> well the user goes to www.mibbit.com asks the question waits a few seconds then closes the tab
[02:19:52] <greg5green> switched to os x in 2010
[02:19:59] <greg5green> yeah, i can see that
[02:20:07] <greg5green> after switching, never found a client i liked
[02:20:14] <greg5green> so i stopped going on efnet
[02:20:19] <Cork> i still miss mirc my self
[02:20:27] <Cork> i'm on hexchat right now
[02:20:28] <greg5green> then a couple months ago i realized i needed to be on freenode
[02:20:38] <greg5green> ircn was just a skin for mirc basically, if you werent familiar
[02:20:39] <Cork> (a clone of xchat thats actually maintained)
[02:21:14] <Cork> greg5green: ah, no i've seen many of clients that build ontop of mirc
[02:21:26] <Cork> btw i'm a mainly linux user now days
[02:21:27] <greg5green> can you set the background to black or grey on hexchat?
[02:21:35] <Cork> thats why mirc is gone as an option
[02:21:45] <Cork> you can set what ever color you like
[02:21:47] <greg5green> yeah, im an os x user, no mirc here either
[02:21:53] <greg5green> hmm, ill have to set it up
[02:21:54] <Cork> ?g hexchat
[02:21:56] <bot-t> Cork, HexChat - http://www.hexchat.org/
[02:22:08] <greg5green> i went on the site quickly but didnt see it on my two page load
[02:22:18] <greg5green> there are like 30 pages on that site lol
[02:23:13] <mkoks> Hi, I have simple html for login and I want cursor to be focused on username input.. why could this not work? --  $(document).ready(function() { $("#username").focus(); });
[02:23:35] <Cork> greg5green: http://i1-win.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/XChat-WDK_11.png?1355289361
[02:23:44] <Cork> you just set the colors all together
[02:23:56] <greg5green> cool
[02:24:39] <greg5green> ill have to set it up for os x
[02:24:41] <Cork> mkoks: you trigger before the browsers own focus rutine
[02:24:45] <greg5green> im assuming i can compile the source to make it work
[02:24:57] <Cork> mkoks: try on('load' instead
[02:25:21] <Cork> greg5green: hexchat went crossplatform just a few months ago
[02:25:27] <Cork> not sure it has mac support yet
[02:25:35] <greg5green> but not for os x
[02:25:42] <Cork> (it was a windows mod before, but they went cross platform when xchat died)
[02:26:08] <Cork> https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xchat-azure/id447521961
[02:26:41] <Cork> they have plans to try to merge those two projects into hexchat
[02:26:43] <Cork> https://www.facebook.com/HexChat/posts/386623631396756
[02:27:16] <greg5green> yeah, hexchat tells me to install xchat azure instead
[02:27:44] <Cork> greg5green: they've been at it for < 1 year so ... :) give them a chance
[02:28:20] <mkoks> Cork thanks for answer, but this doesnt work for me too.. I also tried to do it from console manually and nothing happened + no error given
[02:28:37] <Cork> uh...
[02:28:41] <Cork> that is weird
[02:28:48] <Cork> what version of jquery?
[02:29:28] <mkoks> 1.8.3
[02:29:35] <Cork> hmm so its not that
[02:29:47] <mkoks> tried on ff and chrome
[02:31:49] <Cork> mkoks: http://fiddle.jshell.net/XT9RW/show/
[02:31:52] <Cork> wfm
[02:32:08] <Cork> source: http://jsfiddle.net/XT9RW/
[02:36:47] <faraway> i have the following selector http://jsfiddle.net/mntV7/ which works great, i'm just wondering if there is an easyer/better solution (to support that kind of nested classes is required, so i can't change the html structure). i want to select all elements with the class .test in the node that "closest" to the ".container"
[02:41:02] <Cork> faraway: var test = $(".container").find(".test").first(); test.add(test.nextAll('.test')
[02:41:08] <Cork> is a better choice
[02:41:18] <Cork> as it will result in a speedier selector
[02:41:36] <Cork> * test.add(test.nextAll('.test'))
[02:42:06] <Cork> eq(0) is something that you never want to have in the selector string
[02:42:21] <faraway> Cork: wold it make a differntce internaly if i do $(".container").find(".test:first")   or $(".container").find(".test").first(); ... i would have thought that for $(".container").find(".test").first(); it would create the whole list first
[02:42:23] <Cork> that will effectively loop over all the earlier matches for each time you have it
[02:42:38] <Cork> faraway: yes the later one is faster
[02:42:57] <Cork> avoice : selectors as much as possible
[02:43:11] <Cork> as those become parsed out and called as functions
[02:43:38] <Cork> for each previously matched element
[02:43:53] <greg5green> faraway, yes, but im not having much luck at 5:45 doing it the way it should be
[02:44:16] <greg5green> oh, sorry, that was a response to your first question
[02:44:18] <faraway> Cork: ok thx
[02:45:30] <Cork> faraway: $('#container').find('.test:eq(0)') does $('#container').find('.test') with a regex match for the :eq(0); then through a wrapper calles eq(0) for each element resulting in one element returned for the next state
[02:46:25] <Cork> faraway: while $('#container').find('.test').eq(0) finds #container and then all .test, then grabs the first element from that list and wraps that in a new jquery obejct
[02:47:22] <Cork> faraway: so it does a lot less loops cause its not as generic as the : interface has to be
[02:47:22] <Cork> same goes for :input, :selected and so on
[02:47:22] <greg5green> doesn't :eq(0) have less browser support though?
[02:47:22] <greg5green> or am i remembering wrong?
[02:47:22] <Cork> no
[02:47:34] <Cork> :eq(0) is used through a hook in sizzle
[02:47:39] <Cork> so its pure jquery
[02:47:49] <Cork> or rather pure js
[02:48:07] <bahamas> does it make a difference if I use single or double quotes for selectors?
[02:48:14] <Cork> no
[02:48:19] <Cork> javascript don't care
[02:48:25] <bahamas> thought so
[02:48:27] <greg5green> in 1 of 100,000 of cases, yes
[02:48:30] <greg5green> so, no
[02:48:32] <Cork> i have a strict standard my self though :)
[02:48:45] <Cork> i use dubble quote for html and single quites for javascript
[02:48:54] <greg5green> same
[02:49:06] <Cork> its an old habbit from back when you actually wrote everything as event attributes
[02:49:27] <Cork> now days it doesn't really matter
[02:50:47] <faraway> Cork: ah ok, same for :first ? so :first would not stop at the time it finds the element, but creates the whole list first and then does the tests? and :first needs to be parse and if not supported by browser goes through the whole Sizzle pipeline with complete testing for all found elements?
[02:52:13] <zoran119> i have a li element which i pick up like this $('.myClass'). how can i get its text? - $('.myClass').text() gives TypeError: Object #<HTMLLIElement> has no method 'text'
[02:52:32] <Cork> faraway: :first yes first the list is created then the list is looped and tested one at a time ageist the selector
[02:52:33] <Cork> while .first() is just a wrapper for .eq(0)
[02:52:33] <Cork> and eq(0) is just a wrapper for $($org_query_object[0])
[02:52:37] <greg5green> :first-child
[02:52:52] <greg5green> man, i really need to look with how jquery reads these selectors
[02:52:56] <Cork> zoran119: sounds like $ is prototype
[02:52:58] <Cork> not jquery
[02:53:05] <Cork> else that would work
[02:53:11] <EdwardIII> hey, i've got an issue, i think it might be to do with propagation: http://jsfiddle.net/unmtG/
[02:53:43] <greg5green> http://jsfiddle.net/unmtG/1/
[02:53:44] <greg5green> fixed.
[02:53:47] <Cork> zoran119: or some other framework :)
[02:53:59] <zoran119> Cork: the error is from inside chrome console... the page i'm inspecting only has jquery (no prototype)
[02:54:13] <Cork> EdwardIII: yes, you need to either check event.target === this
[02:54:29] <Cork> EdwardIII: or add an event listener to the link with event.stopPropagation()
[02:54:35] <Cork> ah
[02:54:42] <Cork> zoran119: firebug?
[02:55:04] <zoran119> Cork: the google chrome inbuilt inspector...
[02:55:18] <Cork> hmm not sure about a pref for that one
[02:55:23] <faraway> Cork: yeah , thats clear. i just had a false assumption about who  :first and :eq(0) are handled internally. thx again for clarification.
[02:55:24] <Cork> do $ = window.jQuery
[02:56:28] <Cork> faraway: jquery or sizzle (don't remember if its before calling sizzle or in sizzle) the selector string is matched for :<commands>
[02:56:40] <Cork> the selector is split around each of those selectors
[02:56:56] <EdwardIII> Cork: awesome, you're a star, thanks! http://jsfiddle.net/unmtG/3/
[02:57:06] <Cork> faraway:  then each section that isn't one of those sections is ran through the doms normal selectorAll
[02:57:19] <Cork> faraway: and then the command is called through a loop
[02:57:35] <Cork> faraway: and then from the resulting jquery object the next selector is ran
[02:57:39] <Cork> and so on
[03:00:06] <sunbeam> hi, i'm trying to reset a form including checkboxes
[03:00:13] <sunbeam> however, i can only reset the input fields
[03:00:17] <sunbeam> how can I uncheck the checkboxes?
[03:00:23] <sunbeam> jQuery.fn.reset = function () { $(this).each (function() { this.reset(); });}
[03:00:26] <sunbeam> this is what I use now
[03:02:11] <the_dark_knight> Hi, I have a table containing 5 rows. The rows have ids - row1, row2, row3, row4, row5 respectively. Names of first two rows is "before" and names of the remaining three rows is "after". How do I show and hide the rows with their names in jquery? please help.
[03:02:25] <Cork> sunbeam: you should just have to call $('form')[0].reset()
[03:02:33] <bahamas> btw, I have a script from google on my page that causes an error. could that interfere with the rest of the javascript and cause jquery to not set that header for example?
[03:02:42] <raygerrard> $("#row1").hide();
[03:02:55] <greg5green> bahamas, remove it and check.
[03:02:58] <sunbeam> Cork: i did
[03:03:01] <greg5green> simple troubleshooting
[03:03:14] <bahamas> the_dark_knight: they have the name attribute set to "before"?
[03:03:15] <Cork> bahamas: yes
[03:03:16] <faraway> Cork: yes that what i remembered  form the last time i looked at the source. i just thought (or lets better say hoped :D) that :eq(0) and :first can be/are handled with an early out. without continuing testing the remaining elements.
[03:03:24] <the_dark_knight> bahamas: yes
[03:03:26] <Cork> bahamas: if js fails to parse you don't get js at all
[03:03:53] <sunbeam> Cork: oh
[03:04:00] <sunbeam> Cork: it is because I use jquery uniform
[03:04:03] <sunbeam> (custom design checkboxes)
[03:04:05] <the_dark_knight> raygerrard: I want something like $("#before").hide(). but it is not working.
[03:04:15] <Cork> faraway: how would '.test:eq(0) .other' work in that case?
[03:04:23] <greg5green> $('.before')
[03:04:30] <greg5green> put the class on them....
[03:04:57] <raygerrard> . for class # for id
[03:05:00] <Cork> faraway: and remember the interface is generic it needs to support calls like :animated
[03:05:40] <the_dark_knight> bahamas: doing $("#before").hide() didn't help.
[03:06:04] <greg5green> the_dark_knight, do you know css?
[03:06:09] <Cork> the_dark_knight: wait you have names on your table rows??
[03:06:11] <the_dark_knight> raygerrard: wait
[03:06:24] <the_dark_knight> Cork: yes.
[03:06:30] <Cork> the_dark_knight: thats not valid
[03:06:48] <Cork> if nothing else you should prefix those with data-
[03:07:04] <Cork> <tr id="row1" data-name="before">
[03:07:23] <Cork> and you would select that through $('[data-name="before"]')
[03:07:31] <greg5green> cork, i dont think thats the battle that needs battling
[03:07:53] <greg5green> that sounds like an instant classname
[03:08:01] <Cork> greg5green: i've seen enough ppl having problems when browsers add new properties to not argue with it
[03:08:17] <Cork> and yes class might be what he needs, and in that case its a much better option
[03:08:44] <Cork> but the name attribute is a real problem and REALLY should be fixed if nothing else
[03:08:54] <raygerrard> i cant think of any reason you would need to add a class to every row in a table in order to hide them one by one
[03:09:11] <raygerrard> what are you trying to achieve darkknight?
[03:09:31] <Cork> i have a hard time finding a reason why to have id's on rows either; but thats just me :)
[03:10:40] <the_dark_knight> Cork: suppose I have delete functionality for the row itself, then jquery should be able to identify which row to remove() that's why the ids
[03:10:46] <bahamas> I'm starting to suspect that the error comes from somewhere in my code. I removed the google script that was causing a syntax error and now the same error occurs in a facebook script
[03:11:06] <Cork> the_dark_knight: and the remove button is in the row?
[03:11:08] <the_dark_knight> Cork: by the way I am trying to put data-name into my code.
[03:11:13] <greg5green> the_dark_knight, you can do that in other ways
[03:11:16] <the_dark_knight> Cork: yes.
[03:11:26] <the_dark_knight> greg5green: what do you mean?
[03:11:29] <Cork> the_dark_knight: $(this).closest('tr').remove()
[03:11:36] <Cork> no need for an id to do that
[03:11:46] <greg5green> or you can even use .index()
[03:11:52] <greg5green> and .eq for dynamically figuring it out
[03:12:02] <Cork> ya, but thats overkill as you already know where you are
[03:12:41] <the_dark_knight> thanks Cork reat stuff.
[03:13:02] <the_dark_knight> greg5green: tell me about the index()
[03:13:07] <Cork> ?.index
[03:13:08] <bot-t> .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[03:13:25] <Cork> it will get the index number of the child in relation to the parent
[03:13:26] <greg5green> read about it instead
[03:13:45] <Cork> so if you go .index() on the tr you will know its row number
[03:13:54] <Cork> (starting at 0)
[03:15:08] <the_dark_knight> Cork: Suppose I have a table with cols - roll_no, name, marks, delete (span). And I have put the id of row as the id of my table from db.
[03:15:29] <the_dark_knight> Cork: that's the way I am doing right now.
[03:15:30] <raygerrard> data-id=""
[03:15:48] <faraway> Cork: well for :eq(n) or :first it would probably have an internal counter and if n reached or first element does an early out and continue with the rest of the selector (or doing an index access to the partial result  if the selector part the :eq(n), :first belongs is supported by the browser). for the other pseudo selectors it is clear that the that the test needs to be done to all elements.
[03:15:52] <Cork> the_dark_knight: that might be valid depending on what you want, but ya most likely data-id is what you want
[03:16:02] <Cork> cause id="" has to be globally uniq on the page
[03:16:12] <the_dark_knight> Cork: yes. exactly
[03:16:37] <Cork> so data-id="" is a better option as you might have more tables on the page in the future
[03:16:40] <the_dark_knight> Cork: That's why I will be setting it to a unique id from mysql's incremental primary key
[03:16:51] <Cork> uniq for that table ya
[03:16:55] <Cork> but thats not uniq enough
[03:17:21] <faraway> Cork: anyway i now know that my assumption was false, and i know how to do correctly. thats the important thing for now. but i'll definitely will look at sizzle source again.
[03:17:27] <the_dark_knight> Cork: I'm also adding the name of the table as a prefix to the id.
[03:17:31] <Cork> data-id will give you the same access if you need it for database access, but without forcing the browser to store it in a hash table
[03:17:56] <Cork> the_dark_knight: id="" has effects on memory uses and so on
[03:18:09] <Cork> as it needs to keep a reference list for those values => elements
[03:18:35] <Cork> and most of the time you don't care about that selector, so you can just as well use the cheaper data-id=""
[03:18:55] <the_dark_knight> Cork: oh. I didn't know about memorey uses..
[03:19:35] <Cork> the_dark_knight: normally its not a problem, but it can be quite a big if you use it to store things that isn't needed
[03:19:41] <the_dark_knight> Cork: So data-id for only table rows right? not for the other objects like txtbox?
[03:19:57] <Cork> the_dark_knight: data- is a namescope
[03:20:10] <Cork> its for "data" the website developer want to store for the element
[03:20:18] <Cork> its free for use for the website developer
[03:20:31] <Cork> its garanteed by spec to NEVER be used by the browser
[03:21:01] <Cork> so no risk of future collision with new implementations
[03:22:04] <bahamas> ok, so the problem is that I'm missing a closing parenthesis after some function arguments. is there any way to find it as the error is signaled in some external scripts?
[03:22:42] <Cork> bahamas: if you check in firefox or chrome you should get a line number that is quite close
[03:22:44] <the_dark_knight> Cork: so should I use it or not and stick with id?
[03:23:14] <Cork> but the browser can't tell exactly, it just know when it "at latest must have been closed"
[03:23:21] <bahamas> Cork: that's the problem. in the firebug console the error is in an external script
[03:23:24] <bahamas> well, yeah
[03:23:38] <Cork> the_dark_knight: if you need the data for communication with the backend server => data-id
[03:23:47] <bahamas> I guess I have to do it myself
[03:23:52] <Cork> the_dark_knight: if you need it to make row selections for some reasons id=""
[03:24:19] <Cork> bahamas: so load the external script
[03:24:23] <Cork> copy the content
[03:24:33] <Cork> and paste it in scratchpad and execute it
[03:24:36] <Cork> bahamas: ^
[03:25:03] <Cork> scratchpad => shift + F4
[03:25:45] <Cork> you should get a comment at the end with the line number
[03:25:58] <the_dark_knight> Cork: I want to pass it to the controller and then to model to delete the row from the db-table and also from the webpage/view
[03:26:23] <Cork> the_dark_knight: that sounds like an exact match with the first case then so data-id
[03:26:31] <the_dark_knight> Cork: yes.
[03:27:56] <the_dark_knight> Cork: and I should hide it like $('[data-id="row2"]').hide() right?
[03:28:24] <Cork> depends what tries to hide it
[03:28:59] <Cork> if its the remove button we talked about before, there is no need to reference the id
[03:29:41] <the_dark_knight> Cork: yes. You said something about -  $(this).closest('tr').remove() . I'll try that first thing.
[03:29:56] <Cork> just do var row = $(this).closest('tr'); row.hide(); $.ajax('url/remove', { data: { id: tr.data('id'); });
[03:30:34] <Cork> and that can be done from a delegated event listener bound on the table
[03:30:43] <Cork> the table could have use for an id though
[03:31:10] <Cork> $('#table-id').on('click', 'button.remove', function() { $(this).closest('tr'); row.hide(); $.ajax('url/remove', { data: { id: tr.data('id'); }); });
[03:31:33] <Cork> where button.remove is the button to remove the row ex. <button class="remove">Remove</button>
[03:32:07] <Cork> (one each row)
[03:32:42] <liox_> hello I have a jquery script to log in ajax and the same is presenting an error: Error: Permission denied to access property 'toString' to which I could not identify.
[03:33:13] <Cork> liox_: sounds like your trying to send a dom element
[03:35:00] <pSouper> hi all - would anyone know id twitter bootstrap has callbacks for "collapse" - i'd like to run a function once a collapse accordion has finished opening/closing
[03:35:39] <pSouper> i could use a plugin to listen for resizing elements but that seems a little overkill
[03:36:28] <raygerrard> show, shown hide and hidden
[03:37:16] <raygerrard> shown/hidden are the ones you would use
[03:37:56] <pSouper> hi raygerrard - would they listen for a completed show/hide independently - i.e a twitter show can be listen for?
[03:38:36] <raygerrard> twitter show?
[03:39:18] <raygerrard> if you had an accordion with a class of .twitter you should use $(".twitter").on("hidden", yourFunc);
[03:39:36] <pSouper> ahh- that sounds like the titcket
[03:39:39] <bahamas> greg5green: Cork: found the problem eventually. thanks for all the help and suggestions
[03:39:42] <pSouper> thanks you raygerrard
[03:39:49] <raygerrard> yw
[03:40:17] <liox_> Cork: look at my script
[03:40:43] <Cork> ?
[03:40:47] <liox_> Cork: http://pastebin.com/7889nZc3
[03:41:43] <Cork> donno then
[03:42:15] <Cork> put a breakpoint where if crashes and see what the variables contain
[03:44:21] <pSouper> @raygerrard - worked perfectly - mucho-kudo
[03:46:26] <keirlav87> is there a benefit to storing anonymous funcs within variables rather than just creating a named function?
[03:46:42] <raygerrard> functino hoisting
[03:47:03] <Cork> keirlav87: not really, your not taking up a name in the local namescope; thats about it
[03:47:36] <raygerrard> http://elegantcode.com/2011/03/24/basic-javascript-part-12-function-hoisting/
[03:47:38] <Cork> where the code is executed might change depending on how you wrap if i you make a function delcaration
[03:47:44] <keirlav87> see it alot in reading that i do nowadays, wondered if it is something I should adopt - not really in the habit of it at the minute
[03:49:07] <confuzzler> I'm trying to rotate an image with jQuery, and the rotation part works fine. However, I have a div with some content underneath that image and I can't quite figure out how to "re-render" the page with the content in the correct position
[03:50:39] <Cork> i love this one my self :)
[03:50:53] <Cork> ?eval var dontdo = true;if(!dontdo) { var function name() { return "woops"; } } name()
[03:51:01] <Cork> opps
[03:51:11] <Cork> ?eval var dontdo = true;if(!dontdo) { function name() { return "woops"; } } print(name())
[03:51:22] <Cork> sigh the bot is dead again...
[03:51:27] <Cork> js> var dontdo = true;if(!dontdo) { function name() { return "woops"; } } print(name())
[03:51:30] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[03:51:38] <Cork> js> var dontdo = true;if(!dontdo) { var name = function() { return "woops"; } } print(name())
[03:51:41] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[03:51:44] <Cork> ...
[03:51:48] <Cork> js> var dontdo = true;if(!dontdo) { var name = function() { return "woops"; } }; print(name())
[03:51:51] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[03:51:54] <Cork> stupid bot
[03:52:25] <Cork> man wonder what that thing runs....
[03:54:37] <TeraJL> i'm trying to make a tap event, but all the .js to make the tap event also bind to mouse, is there any way to make a jquery mobile tap event only for real tap events?
[03:56:33] <the_dark_knight> Hi, Cork , raygerrard please see this - http://www.bpaste.net/show/Ciz40X7aW8ewovWcsNdp/ . I want to hide rows except a particular row.
[03:56:35] <Cork> TeraJL: on('touchstart') should do that
[03:57:23] <Cork> $(rows).not(userOfAccount).hide()
[03:57:55] <Cork> though that said; you should always quote your values
[03:57:59] <Cork> "[data-name='usersOf-" + accountId + "']"
[03:58:28] <confuzzler> I'm rotating an image in jquery. The image has a caption beneath it and I can't seem to figure out how to move that caption down. How would you move that caption down, as the image now overlaps the caption
[03:59:35] <raygerrard> $("tr").not("[data-id='1234']").hide();
[03:59:50] <TeraJL> Cork, but that way is kind of hard, because i need to make, tap, swipeleft and swiperight on the same object, but for touch only... with touchstart i need to time the clicks and make all the hard work
[04:00:45] <Cork> TeraJL: ya, but i don't know of any plugin that doesn't wrap both
[04:01:00] <Cork> you could alway grab one and butcher it if you prefer that
[04:01:13] <the_dark_knight> Cork: by row you mean "tr"
[04:01:35] <Cork> no i mean a collection of all the rows
[04:01:43] <raygerrard> however you wish to select your rows, just chain .not(selector)
[04:02:07] <Cork> the_dark_knight: or did you want to hide columns?
[04:02:40] <Cork> you should use classes if thats what you're trying to do
[04:04:42] <the_dark_knight> Cork: suppose I was using class = "class1" then to hide rows with data-name="usersOf-10" I should be doing $(class).not(userOfAccount).hide() right?
[04:04:56] <SPYGAME> any suggestion for some progress bar uploader ?
[04:05:52] <Cork> the_dark_knight: if you add it on the row you do something like $('#table tr').not('.class').hide()
[04:06:11] <Cork> * $('#table tr').not('.class1').hide()
[04:06:22] <TeraJL> Cork, is there any way to set the "tap" event, and then remove all the click events?
[04:06:36] <the_dark_knight> Cork: suppose My table had an id="table" then?
[04:06:39] <Cork> .off('click')
[04:07:14] <Cork> the_dark_knight: then you use #table; its not there that the question stands its where you add the class
[04:07:48] <Cork> the_dark_knight: you first have to select so you get a range with all the rows, then you select the row you DON'T want to hide
[04:07:54] <Cork> through .not()
[04:07:58] <Cork> and hide the rest
[04:08:14] <the_dark_knight> raygerrard: $("tr").not(usersOfAccount).hide(); hides all the table rows except the one with data-name I have given but it also hides trs from all other tables.
[04:08:40] <Cork> the_dark_knight: yes, you need to target the table your after
[04:08:41] <the_dark_knight> Cork: yes. thats right.
[04:08:41] <TeraJL> Cork, didn't work, but thanks
[04:09:09] <Cork> TeraJL: you would have to target the correct element
[04:09:14] <Cork> and not sure what that is
[04:09:34] <Cork> might be $(document).off('click')
[04:09:43] <TeraJL> Cork, mousedown made something, but broke the tap too
[04:09:50] <Cork> ah
[04:10:24] <raygerrard> if you have an id on your table do $("#tableId > tr")
[04:10:50] <Cork> raygerrard: tr isn't a child of table
[04:10:56] <Cork> so remove the >
[04:11:03] <raygerrard> sorry misstyp
[04:11:10] <raygerrard> e
[04:11:31] <raygerrard> just have a space in the selector
[04:14:04] <po_taka-work> hello, qUnit question: how to ser default value for "Check for Globals"
[04:14:50] <Cork> po_taka-work: what?
[04:15:24] <Cork> your referring to block access to globla variables?
[04:15:27] <raygerrard> just encase your wondering darkknight, browsers implicitly add tbody even if its not in your markup
[04:15:42] <po_taka-work> http://qunitjs.com/ in example there are options "noGlobals" "notrycatch" how to set default values for these ?
[04:17:06] <Cork> po_taka-work: that depends on that framework
[04:17:25] <Cork> and i can't find it in there documentation either
[04:17:30] <Cork> so where are this happening?
[04:18:07] <po_taka-work> I can click it before start testing, no problems, just wondering if there is options to set it :)
[04:18:09] <the_dark_knight> Cork: raygerrard , http://www.bpaste.net/show/jARGzNcXUDhzGNtUBlrV/  this is not working.
[04:18:18] <seutje> QUnit.config.notrycatch = true; ?
[04:18:31] <Cork> the_dark_knight: whats #userInfo ?
[04:18:43] <the_dark_knight> Cork: id of the table.
[04:19:00] <the_dark_knight> Cork: userInfo is the id of the table.
[04:19:01] <Cork> the_dark_knight: so $('#userInfo tr').not()
[04:19:51] <the_dark_knight> Cork: yes. I tried using #userInfo >tr
[04:19:58] <raygerrard> remove >
[04:20:00] <raygerrard> that was my bad
[04:20:06] <the_dark_knight> Cork: but #userInfo tr works
[04:21:11] <Cork> the_dark_knight: if you expect that you will get many users in that table; you should prob use a class instead
[04:21:25] <Cork> attribute selectors performs quite badly
[04:22:03] <Cork> for f***s sake...
[04:22:08] <Cork> ie is color blind >_<
[04:22:18] <Cork> i give it red and it paints the element blue ?!?
[04:22:18] <FernandoBasso> https://gist.github.com/4233108 -- I have a left navigation menu that when clicked opens the specified form. It has href='#form1', href='#form2'. The problem is that since I am using .fadeIn(), it confuses the anchors on where to "place" the view on the browser. Any ideas on how that could be resolved?
[04:22:38] <the_dark_knight> Cork: Yes I am noticing that. the hide is also removing the <th> .
[04:23:04] <Cork> the_dark_knight: put the hr in <tr> in <thead>
[04:23:24] <Cork> and change the selector to $('#userInfo tbody tr')
[04:23:48] <FernandoBasso> If I use 'show()', that is quicker by default, the problem disappears.
[04:24:58] <Cork> the_dark_knight: the structure should be <table><thead><tr><th or td></td or /th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></tfoot><tr><td> (if you want this)</td></tr></tfoot></table>
[04:26:06] <Cork> FernandoBasso: you could update it when the fadeIn ends i guess
[04:26:21] <FernandoBasso> Cork: How so?
[04:26:27] <FernandoBasso> I quite didn't get you.
[04:26:30] <the_dark_knight> Cork: brilliant.
[04:27:03] <Cork> FernandoBasso: cause the element is at the top of the parent element when you start
[04:27:13] <Cork> when the fadeIn starts the element has the wrong offset
[04:27:16] <seutje> po_taka-work: it seems to grab them from url arguments
[04:27:27] <Cork> when fadeIn finnish you have another position of that element
[04:27:27] <seutje> po_taka-work: like ?noglobals&notrycatch
[04:27:37] <Cork> O_o
[04:27:57] <po_taka-work> yea, probably I would make file startTest witch will redirect to another with params :/
[04:28:06] <po_taka-work> anyway not a big deal :) thanks seutje
[04:29:15] <seutje> kinda odd u can't force it
[04:29:28] <DukeDrake> hi
[04:30:54] <DukeDrake> is it possible to prevent a screen from scrolling?
[04:31:19] <DukeDrake> i.e. make it impossible for the screen to move, even if there's more text below?
[04:31:45] <Cork> there is hacks to do it
[04:31:50] <Kasimir> you can do that with either css or javascript
[04:31:51] <Cork> but its tricky to do cross browsers
[04:32:07] <Cork> or rather do cross mobile devices
[04:32:14] <Cork> desktop is quite easy
[04:32:35] <Kasimir> height:100%; works pretty well
[04:32:58] <Kasimir> on html
[04:33:26] <DukeDrake> Cork: that's alright - actually it only has to work for desktop and firefox
[04:33:39] <DukeDrake> Although it's about the width ... ^^
[04:33:50] <DukeDrake> Kasimir: I'll try that
[04:34:22] <Kasimir> dukedrake: or you can prevent scroll with javascript, either way works.
[04:34:51] <DukeDrake> Kasimir: how can I prevent scroll?
[04:34:54] <Kasimir> dukedrake: the nice part of doing it with css is it works on mobiles
[04:35:10] <DukeDrake> , with js?
[04:36:24] <Kasimir> dukedrake: just add a eventlistener and then eventname.preventDefault();
[04:36:46] <Kasimir> dukedrake: or do it with css, I find the css method better in some cases
[04:38:48] <DukeDrake> Kasimir: for which event? o.o
[04:40:28] <Kasimir> dukedrake: an even more simple way to do it, add this to your <body> = <body scroll="no">
[04:41:19] <seutje> yeah, can't preventDefault window scroll event
[04:41:47] <Kasimir> Seutje, cant you? I'm sure I have done it
[04:42:22] <DukeDrake> Kasimir: heh .. I'll try that too!!
[04:42:25] <seutje> scroll="no" doesn't seem to work either
[04:42:48] <Kasimir> should work just fine
[04:42:58] <DukeDrake> hmmm
[04:43:00] <Kasimir> but then again like I said, css is always an option
[04:43:05] <Kasimir> overflow:hidden;
[04:44:06] <DukeDrake> Kasimir: hmmm! =)
[04:44:23] <seutje> can't seem to find any reference to this elusive scroll attribute
[04:44:35] <DukeDrake> scroll="no" doesn't work ... never heard of that attribute before anyway ....
[04:44:39] <seutje> I know scrolling, but that's for iframes, doesn't rly do anything on body
[04:44:40] <DukeDrake> heh
[04:44:50] <Kasimir> dukedrake: tried to set it on the css (body{overflow:hidden})?
[04:45:00] <litenull> DukeDrake: Kasimir idea is ok
[04:45:01] <DukeDrake> I'll try the css now
[04:46:00] <seutje> that should work, but it still allows middle-mouse button type dragging
[04:46:23] <DukeDrake> hm
[04:46:26] <seutje> which, I guess, is a feature not available on OSX
[04:46:41] <Kasimir> seutje: it is available on osx
[04:46:48] <DukeDrake> overflow: hidden; hides the scrollbars
[04:46:55] <seutje> doesn't work on this OSX though
[04:47:02] <Kasimir> seutje just selecting text and dragging it
[04:47:11] <seutje> yeah, not what I meant
[04:47:17] <DukeDrake> I can stil scroll with cursors or typing in an <input>
[04:47:23] <seutje> I meant the thing where u get the up/down arrows when u click mouse3
[04:47:36] <seutje> u can prolly still tab as well, with overflow:hidden
[04:47:46] <DukeDrake> actually the typing in the input fields is the source of my current problem
[04:47:48] <Kasimir> oh right, never seen that, on osx myself
[04:48:09] <DukeDrake> eya, tab works as well
[04:48:18] <seutje> guess u could force the scrollheight on scroll
[04:48:34] <DukeDrake> hm?
[04:48:39] <seutje> but that might end up spassing like crazy
[04:48:44] <seutje> spazzing*?
[04:48:53] <raygerrard> hah
[04:49:07] <litenull> DukeDrake: you could bind an event handler on scroll, and preventDefault ?
[04:50:40] <seutje> u can't prevenDefault scroll on window
[04:50:42] <DukeDrake> litenull: yeah ... urm .......
[04:50:44] <seutje> prevent*
[04:50:54] <seutje> u can, however, set the scrolltop to a fixed value
[04:50:54] <seutje> jQuery(window).on('scroll', function(){ jQuery(window).scrollTop(0); });
[04:50:56] <DukeDrake> how do I do that? *forgot*
[04:50:58] <evaluate> Hello.
[04:51:01] <seutje> doesn't jitter in chrome, at least
[04:51:18] <DukeDrake> seutje: thanx ...
[04:51:21] <seutje> also fixes the scrolling on tabbing
[04:51:36] <seutje> jitters like crazy when selecting though
[04:51:41] <seutje> like if u drag down
[04:51:59] <Kasimir> dukedrake: is it about horizontal or vertical scrolling anyway?
[04:52:00] <seutje> not sure if IE fires window's scroll event when tabbing though
[04:52:12] <DukeDrake> Kasimir: horizontal
[04:52:33] <litenull> seutje: yeah your right
[04:52:39] <DukeDrake> I actually don't understand why it scrolls at all in the first place
[04:52:53] <litenull> could use some plugins like mousewheel on the other hand
[04:53:08] <DukeDrake> as it's not about scrolling with scrollbars, tab, cursors or dragging - but simply clikcing and typing into a <input>
[04:53:23] <litenull> yeah :(
[04:53:40] <evaluate> I am using .slideDown() to show an element that has position: absolute, but instead of it being fixed, and just sliding down, it is being grown from the middle (jquery assigns a margin-top to it, which it then decreases as the element grows). Is there a way to supress this behaviour and the the elements top be at the same position during the entire animation?
[04:54:12] <evaluate> s/the the/have the/
[04:54:36] <seutje> DukeDrake: when an input receives focus, most browsers (if not all) will try to force it entirely into the viewport
[04:54:42] <seutje> it's a feature :P
[04:55:36] <DukeDrake> seutje: ah ... ok, finally ^^
[04:56:07] <DukeDrake> in my case they fore it out of the viewport %)
[04:56:15] <seutje> o.O
[04:56:37] <seutje> is it moved with some black magic technique like transform?
[04:57:32] <Kasimir> aah yeh the old good tab found the snipplet I made ages ago to prevent it: $('input[notab=notab]').on('keydown', function(e){ if (e.keyCode == 9)  e.preventDefault() });
[04:57:52] <Kasimir> then just adding notab="notab" to inputs
[04:57:57] <Kasimir> bit hacky but meh
[04:57:59] <litenull> :)
[04:59:10] <DukeDrake> seutje: yes, how did you guess that? =)
[04:59:36] <seutje> DukeDrake: because transform doesn't move the "hitbox" of the element, just the visual representation
[04:59:45] <DukeDrake> Kasimir: I already switched tab of, yes ^^
[04:59:49] <seutje> like the space it occupies won't change if u scale
[04:59:55] <DukeDrake> seutje: heh
[05:00:12] <seutje> that's how transforms were specced...
[05:00:36] <seutje> otherwise, might as well use position: relative; or negative margins or something
[05:00:52] <DukeDrake> ok, the scrollTop(0) , or scrollLeft(0) works brilliant for the scrollbars.... but not for my prob ... %)
[05:03:49] <seutje> DukeDrake: use position:relative or absolute and move it in the opposite direction of the transform? :x
[05:04:04] <litenull> omfg hax
[05:04:05] <litenull> :D
[05:04:06] <seutje> might end up having to double the transform displacement though
[05:04:16] <DukeDrake> I'll use some transform stuff magic to align it to the step on key input
[05:04:21] <seutje> or use translate to offset the 0-point
[05:04:24] <DukeDrake> err .. yes XD
[05:04:35] <DukeDrake> ok ... gotta go now .... d'urrrrr -.-
[05:04:37] <DukeDrake> bbl
[05:04:40] <seutje> gonna be fiddly and fragile though :x
[05:04:42] <seutje> late
[05:06:15] <jomofcw> Hello !
[05:07:07] <jomofcw> I'm trying to submit a form on the change event of a radio button. But when I do it, it seems to "submit" the form with the previous value of the radio button, not the new one. Is teher any know issue about it ? Solution ? Please.
[05:08:07] <keirlav87> if you have an object, and within a function say var a = myObj; does changing the values held in a change the values in myObj?
[05:10:48] <jomofcw> keirlav87 it's a pure JS question but answer should be yes
[05:13:10] <Cork> keirlav87: yes, object keys are pointers to the values
[05:13:30] <Cork> to when you make a new copy of the object it points to the same values in memory
[05:13:37] <Cork> *so when
[05:13:59] <jomofcw> +1 Cork
[05:14:05] <jomofcw> And hello Cork ^^.
[05:14:27] <jomofcw> Have you read my question just few lines before the keirlav87 one ?
[05:14:29] <keirlav87> cool, thanks, just wasnt sure if it cloned the object or amended its values directly, cheers
[05:16:27] <faraway> jomofcw: which browser? if it is really issue or known behavior you could most likely solve it by using a setTimeout( callbackWherYouDoSumbit , 0);
[05:16:54] <evaluate> Here is an example of the case I've described above: http://jsfiddle.net/NB96V/ Is it possible to prevent jQuery from modifying the top margin of the element in this case?
[05:18:38] <evaluate> s/top margin/margin-top property/
[05:19:17] <keirlav87> remove your margin-top: -50px ?
[05:19:48] <keirlav87> http://jsfiddle.net/NB96V/3/
[05:20:24] <evaluate> keirlav87, I can't, that's being added by a theme I'm using.
[05:20:36] <evaluate> I don't see a real reason though for jQuery to modify that…
[05:21:00] <keirlav87> that's what is causing the 'slideup' animation you're getting
[05:21:53] <keirlav87> if you absolutely can't remove it, use this instead http://jsfiddle.net/NB96V/4/
[05:22:53] <evaluate> keirlav87, thank you very much! Is there a reason though why jquery modifies the margin-top in this case?
[05:24:40] <keirlav87> i'm not sure, I assume it's because slideDown calculates css after init and so until slideDown is called it assumes the element has 0 margin
[05:27:48] <evaluate> Also, is there a way to make the slideDown work, even if the element has display set to 'none !important'? It seems that in this case, since jQuery only adds 'display: block' to the elements properties, the !important one takes precedence and it won't show...
[05:29:29] <evaluate> Like here for example: http://jsfiddle.net/NB96V/7/
[05:31:10] <jomofcw> Why this "$form_element.find('input').on('change',function(e){console.log($(this).val());$form_element.trigger('submit');});" display me the right value of the radio buttons I just change, and submit the form with the previous one ?
[05:31:51] <keirlav87> anyone getting a weird error in fiddle where text is not typing in correct position?
[05:35:54] <evaluate> keirlav87, had an error where I couldn't type at all, a refresh of the page fixed it for me, though.
[05:39:18] <the_dark_knight> Hi, see here - http://www.bpaste.net/show/zdkueVXvKzPhBD8qb6dF/. This is part of my view (mvc). Suppose first $isMasterAccount is set to 0 in my controller. So there won't be 'childrenDiv' div on my webpage. What if I want to show() this div using jquery?
[05:39:32] <KU0N> hello
[05:40:38] <KU0N> I'm trying to use getResponseHeader on a CORS GET request, but it always returns null for my custom headers. I checked chrome console and the headers are listed.
[05:41:38] <dotDeeka> evaluate: do you have to have that css? or can you modify it
[05:42:46] <evaluate> dotDeeka, If there is any way to prevent modifying the css, I would rather do that. This is a theme that could update in the future, that means the css files could update too, and my changes might get lost...
[05:43:13] <the_dark_knight> hi somebody please help.
[05:43:13] <KU0N> I've been searching for a solution, but everything I find is about sending a custom header to the server, I'd like to read them in the response.
[05:43:22] <dotDeeka> evaluate: I see...
[05:43:24] <KU0N> I'm using jquery 1.8.3 btw.
[05:43:29] <the_dark_knight> see here - http://www.bpaste.net/show/zdkueVXvKzPhBD8qb6dF/. This is part of my view (mvc). Suppose first $isMasterAccount is set to 0 in my controller. So there won't be 'childrenDiv' div on my webpage. What if I want to show() this div using jquery?
[05:43:36] <evaluate> dotDeeka, I can add my own css, but AFAIK there isn't any way of overriding an '!important' setting…
[05:45:08] <seutje> evaluate: inline !important or double !important :P
[05:45:10] <faraway> jomofcw: what does the .is(":checked") return for the previous element as that time ?
[05:45:39] <seutje> or equal specificity single !important succeeding the initial !important
[05:46:20] <geiregjo> can someone help me with some jqm stuff
[05:46:31] <evaluate> seutje, well, if I set the element to 'block !important' there's not much sense in using 'slideDown()' on it anymore, is there… :-)
[05:46:47] <seutje> wait no, I think double important only works on the IEs
[05:47:02] <seutje> evaluate: u can set ur own stepper and have it add important every step :P
[05:47:12] <geiregjo> I have a <button> element wich jquery builds its button around. The <button> element has a class to do some extra styling but these are not applied to the button because its the child of the final button jquery craeted.
[05:47:53] <the_dark_knight> see here - http://www.bpaste.net/show/zdkueVXvKzPhBD8qb6dF/. This is part of my view (mvc). Suppose first $isMasterAccount is set to 0 in my controller, then controller won't load the div-childrenDiv. So there won't be 'childrenDiv' div on my view. What if I want to show() this div using jquery? $isMasterAccount's value is fetched from the model by the controller where this is some field from a mysql table. Suppose I set this field to 1 with jqer
[05:48:25] <seutje> evaluate: http://api.jquery.com/animate/#step
[05:49:46] <dotDeeka> evaluate: what if you did something like this http://jsfiddle.net/dotDeeka/6beAP/1/
[05:50:19] <jomofcw> faraway hello ! .is(':checked') return true
[05:52:00] <faraway> jomofcw: which browser and system do you test this in ?
[05:52:11] <jomofcw> firefox
[05:52:18] <jomofcw> windows 7
[05:52:26] <jomofcw> hm... vista in fact, I'm at work.
[05:54:14] <evaluate> dotDeeka, hmm, would I even need a wrapper? If it's possible to set the 'block !important' through jquery, I could animate the height of the element directly...
[05:56:00] <dotDeeka> evaluate: yea i don't think the wrapper is absolutely necessary. I just wanted to illustrate that as long as your selectors are more specific, even if your styles get included in the page first they will still take precedence
[05:58:02] <seutje> evaluate: http://jsbin.com/ezisil/2/edit
[05:58:09] <seutje> seems to work
[05:58:44] <seutje> (click the lol btw_
[05:58:45] <seutje> )
[05:59:12] <seutje> hmm wait, u can just use the lolback
[05:59:52] <litenull> that is some lol code
[05:59:56] <litenull> :)
[06:00:19] <fRAiLtY-> http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/brochure-printing2 Why when you select options in drop-down 2 (Size) does it not unselect the column when you change? The column selected should be the size selected. It doesn't "swap" as such
[06:02:32] <litenull> :)
[06:03:06] <DukeDrake> re
[06:03:16] <evaluate> Or, what I think looks best, set height to 0 and display to 'block!important' before doing the animation: http://jsfiddle.net/6beAP/2/
[06:03:29] <evaluate> Thanks for all the tips! :-)
[06:04:05] <faraway> jomofcw: are you sure the you don't have another none radio input element with the same name in your form after your radio button.
[06:09:50] <DukeDrake> seutje: with catching the keypress event and preventDefault it works ^^
[06:14:23] <dotDeeka> evaluate: you have to add the overflow hidden or the text inside the div will show up
[06:15:13] <evaluate> dotDeeka, thanks!
[06:16:15] <dotDeeka> evaluate: no problem
[06:16:52] <DarsVaeda> if I want to do $('#foo'), how do I check if '#foo' actually exists so it won't throw an error if I select it and it does not exist?
[06:17:06] <raygerrard> jquery will swallow it anyway
[06:17:23] <DarsVaeda> jslint doesn't :)
[06:17:46] <raygerrard> what
[06:18:13] <DarsVaeda> my firebug tells me "No elements were found with the selector: '#foo'"
[06:18:24] <VictorCL> hi
[06:18:38] <VictorCL> anyone has experience with jquery tinyScrollBar plugin?
[06:18:39] <evaluate> DarsVaeda, jQuery won't throw an error if an element doesn't exist, but this is how you can check if it does: if ($('#element').length != 0)
[06:18:55] <jomofcw> faraway I have four radio button in my form that have the same name in fact, but imo that's how radio button should be use :/.
[06:19:27] <jomofcw> faraway but I have no other input in my form, just those four radio button having the same name but different value and a simple button[type=submit].
[06:20:17] <duderion> hi guys, one question about 'on'
[06:20:38] <faraway> jomofcw: that the radios have the same name is correct. i just want to be sure that you not accidentally have another element e.g. a hidden one with the same name.
[06:21:16] <litenull> duderion: .. ?
[06:21:26] <duderion> should the <span class='add child'> be clickable after creating it like this?
[06:21:27] <duderion> http://pastebin.com/fziZFz6c
[06:21:33] <duderion> because it doesnt..
[06:21:58] <faraway> jomofcw: what happens if you trigger the submit with a timeout: window.setTimeout(function() { $form_element.trigger('submit');} },0);
[06:22:24] <faraway> jomofcw: sorry a } to much
[06:23:46] <johanhar> I'm trying to use jQueryUI Tabs with Dialog. When I run $(el).tabs(), the entire HTML to the given page is put into the Dialog... What can be wrong here?

[06:26:15] <litenull> use this
[06:26:16] <litenull> :)
[06:26:25] <duderion> i got it man :D

[06:41:04] <SPYGAME> hey, i'm using jquery file upload plugin with minimal plugin, as soon as i attach the file it disappears and file field remains empty, any suggestions ?
[06:45:29] <dyong> hellow
[06:45:33] <dyong> hello
[06:45:50] <litenull> dyong: hiw
[06:45:51] <litenull> hi
[06:45:59] <Mottie> bonjouro
[06:46:00] <sunbeam> hi, i have got <input name="controller" />
[06:46:01] <dyong> hi
[06:46:03] <Mottie> bonjour
[06:46:03] <sunbeam> however, when i search
[06:46:06] <litenull> hi
[06:46:08] <sunbeam> I get ?controller=controller
[06:46:09] <litenull> :D
[06:46:13] <sunbeam> how can I avoid this?
[06:46:13] <BadCodSmell> Instead of doing $('<div></div>') is there a same I can tell jquery to specifically treat as html?
[06:46:37] <BadCodSmell> a way
[06:46:37] <dyong> that's just making html DOM
[06:46:50] <mbrzuzy> sunbeam what?
[06:46:53] <BadCodSmell> right but how do I tell jquery to do that and only that
[06:46:55] <mbrzuzy> sunbeam, do you have a form with that input?
[06:46:59] <sunbeam> mbrzuzy: yes
[06:47:01] <litenull> mbrzuzy: lol i didnt understand too
[06:47:09] <dyong> hmm..
[06:47:14] <dyong> i'm sorry
[06:47:25] <mbrzuzy> sunbeam, are you putting anything into the textbox?
[06:47:41] <Mottie> BadCodSmell: You can add HTML inside there too $('<div><span>I like spans</span></div>')
[06:47:52] <sunbeam> mbrzuzy: its a checkbox
[06:48:04] <sunbeam> <input name="controller" type="checkbox" />
[06:48:09] <BadCodSmell> It always screws up and I just want to do it using whatever function it uses underneith
[06:48:15] <mbrzuzy> sunbeam, then you need to assign it a value
[06:48:23] <Mottie> screws up how?
[06:48:27] <mbrzuzy> and if it's checked, that value will be sent on submission
[06:48:34] <mbrzuzy> if it's not checked, nothing will be sent
[06:48:52] <BadCodSmell> I don't want a function that takes my data and guesses what I actually want
[06:48:58] <sunbeam> mbrzuzy: <input name="controller" type="checkbox" value="controller />
[06:48:59] <sunbeam> ahhh
[06:49:01] <sunbeam> nvm i get it
[06:49:03] <dyong> who know if jquery has fixed its memory leak problem?
[06:49:09] <BadCodSmell> I want the exact function to treat the string input as html and make a dom structure from it
[06:49:11] <litenull> sunbeam: xD
[06:49:28] <NoiseEee> BadCodSmell: html()
[06:50:03] <dyong> who know if jquery has fixed its memory leak problem?
[06:50:09] <dyong> T.T
[06:50:18] <sunbeam> litenull: mbrzuzy when there are many checkboxes i can use
[06:50:22] <sunbeam> name="something[]" right?
[06:50:23] <marcules> hmm I have an input field which is x+50 px wide - in a container which is x wide with overflow hidden --- how would I prevent the input field from moving to the left, when the text-cursor reaches the overflown/hidden area?
[06:50:42] <mbrzuzy> sunbeam, to be honest, i'm not sure
[06:50:51] <Mottie> BadCodSmell: why can't you manipulate the string first, then turn it into a jQuery selector?
[06:50:59] <BadCodSmell> For example a selector goes to .find
[06:51:01] <sunbeam> anyone knows?
[06:51:03] <BadCodSmell> where does html go to?
[06:51:14] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: do you know if name="category[]" is good usage? if there are multiple checkboxes?
[06:51:18] <sunbeam> with name="category"
[06:51:21] <litenull> sunbeam: input[type=checkbox] ?
[06:51:41] <BadCodSmell> I don't want a function that takes my data and guesses what I actually want
[06:51:50] <BadCodSmell> I want the exact function to treat the string input as html and make a dom structure from it
[06:51:51] <sunbeam> litenull: yes
[06:51:53] <BadCodSmell> For example a selector goes to .find
[06:51:55] <BadCodSmell> where does html go to?
[06:51:57] <Mottie> You need to define a variable first... var $div = $('<div><span>I like turtles</span></div>'); $div.find('span');
[06:52:22] <dyong> i think so
[06:52:26] <dyong> too
[06:52:45] <raygerrard> you can chain .find()
[06:53:05] <Mottie> BadCodSmell: also you can return to the parent element/selector using .end()
[06:53:28] <Mottie> BadCodSmell: $div.find('span').end().addClass('this-is-a-div');
[06:53:50] <BadCodSmell> Mottie please don't speak.
[06:53:57] <Mottie> o.O
[06:54:00] <litenull> lol :D
[06:54:20] <Mottie> please stop asking questions
[06:54:49] <litenull> randomness at its best
[06:55:52] <Mottie> Two peanuts walk into a bar... and one was a salted
[06:56:10] <raygerrard> the other was nuts
[06:58:08] <marcules> THE PUN, IT HURTS
[06:58:12] <NoiseEee> BadCodSmell: you'll have to provide an online example of html() "not doing what you want", otherwise we assume it works as intended
[07:01:10] <BadCodSmell> html does not do what I want at all
[07:01:20] <BadCodSmell> When I do $('.class')
[07:01:36] <BadCodSmell> This is passsing a string, the string contains what is known as a selector
[07:01:55] <BadCodSmell> jquery looks at the string and says, looks like a selector, better ship it off to find
[07:02:19] <BadCodSmell> when I pass '<div></div>' jquery says that looks like html, ill ship it off to.... where?
[07:02:34] <BadCodSmell> What function does it call to handle html to detached dom?
[07:03:12] <Mottie> http://ejohn.org/blog/dom-documentfragments/
[07:03:19] <NoiseEee> BadCodSmell: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js
[07:03:23] <raygerrard> if you do $("<div></div>") is will create that element
[07:03:26] <NoiseEee> around line 88 there
[07:03:58] <raygerrard> then you can append, prepend it etc
[07:04:20] <subdesign> hey, can I run jquery code if the page (php) is fully loaded?
[07:04:51] <Mottie> subdesign: if jQuery is loaded on the page, yes
[07:05:26] <BadCodSmell> ah parseHTML
[07:05:57] <Mottie> BadCodSmell: I was going to say that before you told me to shut up
[07:07:40] <Mottie> BadCodSmell: but with parseHTML you'll need to use filter() instead of find() on child elements
[07:10:25] <BadCodSmell> Mottie: You have to do that anyway and I have already made a custom function to do both filter and find
[07:10:58] <BadCodSmell> you need filter for the parents and find for all the kids
[07:13:14] <EdwardIII> BadCodSmell, fairly solid nickname right there
[07:13:49] <litenull> :D
[07:15:27] <subdesign> Mottie: isnt working. I load tons of docs in iframes, and want somehow to show a message for the users to "wait, loading.."
[07:15:56] <litenull> subdesign: make an async function
[07:15:58] <subdesign> ie. remove the message with jquery, if page loaded
[07:16:05] <litenull> oh
[07:16:09] <litenull> nevermind
[07:16:26] <Mottie> You don't need jQuery to do that
[07:17:22] <subdesign> Mottie, so how then?
[07:20:17] <Mottie> subdesign: just add a div, styled with css : <div id="loading">Loading...</div>... then when the page is done loading, not sure if you want to wait for all the iframes to finish or just the page itself, just use var msg = document.getElementById('loading'); msg.parentNode.removeChild(msg);
[07:22:13] <subdesign> Mottie, thaks. now I just console.log after echoing the iframes, and nothing in the log console
[07:23:35] <iaj> Hey there.. is it possible to act on all following ( next() ) elements, until the surrouding parent node 'ends'?
[07:23:52] <Mottie> subdesign: I'm not sure what you mean
[07:23:56] <iaj> Currently I got â€¦ .next() but this is the next one only
[07:24:08] <raygerrard> nextAll(0
[07:24:13] <iaj> Ahhh thanks
[07:24:36] <raygerrard> yw
[07:24:49] <Mottie> iaj: siblings() works too
[07:25:05] <Mottie> but that includes prev()
[07:25:12] <raygerrard> lol
[07:26:50] <iaj> so awesome jQuery!
[07:26:54] <iaj> :)
[07:30:06] <subdesign> Mottie, somehow it doesnt remove (with your code) the div..
[07:30:14] <subdesign> after page fully loaded
[07:31:05] <raygerrard> wrap it in a window.load
[07:32:22] <Alarm_> hello. i got a problem sending a date correctly on my server. so what happens. when i debug the ajax post before it is send i see that my date variable is "Date {Tue Jan 29 2013 00:00:00 GMT+0200 (GTB Standard Time)}"
[07:32:36] <Alarm_> but unfortunatelly what is send to the server is 2013-01-28T22:00:00.000Z"
[07:32:46] <Alarm_> which is 2 hours back
[07:33:02] <Alarm_> it has to do with the GMT+0200
[07:33:50] <raygerrard> what are you using server side
[07:34:34] <raygerrard> possibly an issue with the locale setting on your server
[07:34:34] <Mottie> yeah, maybe jQuery is easier... I think this will work (untested) $('iframe').load().promise().done(function(){ $('#loading').remove(); });
[07:34:48] <Alarm_> struts 2
[07:34:53] <Alarm_> i dont think its the server.
[07:35:12] <Alarm_> the post that i see on my firebug in the end is wrong
[07:35:28] <Alarm_> although the variable has the correct value , it is posted wrong on the server
[07:35:48] <Alarm_> its not server side, its client side
[07:37:06] <Alarm_> the post from my browser is wrong. the sent date is already modified (by json ? )  i am using data: JSON.stringify({myDate:myDate}) ,
[07:37:14] <Alarm_> on my ajax call
[07:37:18] <Alarm_> so maybe this is the problem
[07:37:52] <raygerrard> what if you call tostring on it
[07:38:26] <Mottie> Alarm_: did you convert the date to UTC? http://praveenlobo.com/techblog/how-to-convert-javascript-local-date-to-utc-and-utc-to-local-date/
[07:39:39] <Alarm_> ok the issue is cause by JSON.stringify
[07:39:56] <Alarm_> myDate is correct. but when using it with stringify it changes the value
[07:40:04] <Alarm_> Mottie: no i did not do this convertion
[07:40:23] <CodeFriar> is it possible to give jquery an array of selectors to act on?
[07:40:44] <CodeFriar> ie both ('.foo') and ('.bar') ?
[07:41:02] <Mottie> CodeFriar: $(['.foo','.bar'].join(',')).addClass('yay')
[07:41:35] <Mottie> CodeFriar: but $('.foo, .bar').addClass('yay'); is easiest
[07:41:37] <keirlav87> would anyone please mind taking a look at this fiddle and help me figure out why the width of the box is not being factored into determining the pixel size of the text? http://jsfiddle.net/NB96V/29/
[07:42:41] <Mottie> subdesign: have you thought about loading the iframes when they come into view, like infinite scrolling... it'll speed up the page load
[07:48:05] <Mottie> kierlav87: I think it's because the <p> has built in margins... you need to reset it
[07:49:41] <keirlav87> at the moment the width of my div isn't being factored in at all, and I can't seem to figure out why
[07:52:46] <JSM87> Hi guys, im using .remove() to get rid of an image I dont want in the footer of one of my pages. This works however for a split second you can see the image just before the remove() kicks in. Is there a good way to stop this so its removed before the eye has a chance to see it. Creating a flickering effect at present.
[07:53:40] <Clex> JSM87: remove it from the HTML.
[07:53:56] <JSM87> Clex: How do you mean?
[07:54:11] <Clex> Well s/<img ...>//
[07:54:32] <JSM87> I cant directly delete it from html as the footer is global hence its the same on 400 pages. its just one page I dont want it...
[07:54:44] <grafi> o.o
[07:55:22] <JSM87> Clex: I dont understand what you mean by s/<img ...>//
[07:55:31] <Clex> JavaScript runs at runtime. You can't change that. ^_^
[07:55:33] <sunbeam> hi, i have many checkboxes with name="tags[]" - I want to get the value of those that are checked, how can I best do tyhat?
[07:55:40] <Clex> I mean removing the HTML code.
[07:55:59] <JSM87> Clex: Currently I have $j('#exhibitionRegisterButton').remove(); which is the div wrapping the image...
[07:57:34] <Mottie> sunbeam: use $('[name*="tags"]:checked')
[07:58:10] <Mottie> kierlav87: I'm not sure... have you looked at fittext.js? https://github.com/davatron5000/FitText.js
[07:58:46] <NoiseEee> JSM87: set display:none in the stylesheet?
[07:59:32] <sunbeam> Mottie: thanks
[08:00:24] <iaj> Hmm... whats the most common way to append a <img ...> to the end of a certain div?
[08:00:31] <iaj> eg before </div> comes?
[08:00:32] <sunbeam> Mottie: $('[name*="tags[]"]:checked').each(function() { alert("test"); }
[08:00:36] <sunbeam> Mottie: $('[name*="tags"]:checked').each(function() { alert("test"); }
[08:00:44] <sunbeam> tried both but don't get anything although they arechecked
[08:01:13] <Mottie> sunbeam: what does your HTML look like?... just one input is enough
[08:01:22] <keirlav87> i need something which will factor the height of the element too, unfortuantely
[08:01:33] <quicksilver> iaj: .append ?
[08:02:37] <Mottie> keirlav87: there are links to two other plugins at the bottom of that fitText.js page
[08:02:47] <raygerrard> $(selector).appendTo(selector);
[08:02:49] <Mottie> kerilav87: never used them before
[08:03:05] <sunbeam> Mottie: <input type="checkbox" value="headset" id="tag-headset" name="tag[]" />
[08:05:23] <SPYGAME> how can i set my headers inside the uploadify function ?
[08:06:20] <bitpimp> I'm trying to cause droppables to only accept one draggable.  In drop on the droppable I'm using $(this).droppable('option', 'accept', ui.draggable);
[08:06:34] <bitpimp> on the out: I'm using...
[08:06:53] <bitpimp> $(this).droppable('option', 'accept', '.tile');
[08:07:10] <bitpimp> anything wrong that anyone can see right off?  isn't working consistently.
[08:07:17] <fonko> guys i have a document that is loading each time i scroll down
[08:07:21] <fonko> its an app inside facebook
[08:07:36] <sunbeam> Mottie: nvm it works
[08:07:37] <fonko> i want to control with a overly, when an ajax is being called
[08:07:38] <sunbeam> made a typo
[08:07:44] <sunbeam> thnx
[08:07:47] <fonko> any ideas?
[08:08:21] <Mottie> sunbeam: LOL cool... I was trying to see what was going on
[08:10:03] <Mottie> sunbeam: well I made this demo anyway LOL http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/YLjzC/
[08:10:40] <sunbeam> cool thanks!
[08:10:54] <Mottie> sunbeam: if you use [] inside of the selector, I think they need to be escaped too: $('[name="tag\[\]"]')
[08:11:43] <Mottie> sunbeam: so it's just easier to use $('[name*="tag"]')
[08:16:57] <sunbeam> yep
[08:22:02] <Mottie> keirlav87: you know if you resize the block and watch the console debugging text... it resets the "minFontPixels"
[08:22:22] <Mottie> errr changes the option
[08:22:45] <keirlav87> i know - but i'm not sure if that's the problem, I think it has something to do with the width of the p tag being the full size of the div always
[08:23:23] <Mottie> it's not, I change the p background color to red instead of the resizable... it's the same width as the resizable, but not always the full height
[08:24:12] <keirlav87> yeah I think that's what the problem is
[08:24:47] <Mottie> personally, I think it's a bug in the plugin
[08:24:59] <keirlav87> because the plugin is looking for a width that doesn't equal the max width ( the max width is the size of the resizing div)
[08:26:32] <keirlav87> I think.. maybe not though, but if i alter the plugin slightly, so that I store a reference to the width of the p each time, and then pass this as the width property, rather than calculate the p tags current width, it might work
[08:27:31] <keirlav87> lol im such an idiot..
[08:27:46] <keirlav87> or just set css of the p tag to display block, then float left - so it doesnt fill the div each time
[08:27:50] <keirlav87> and it works fine -_-
[08:28:50] <Mottie> whew
[08:28:52] <Mottie> LOL
[08:29:34] <keirlav87> close to pulling my hair out, staring at the plugin code for about 90 mins thinking why wont you work.. -_-
[08:29:55] <Mottie> I think I have a new grey hair
[08:30:03] <nerk> lol
[08:30:06] <nerk> that's my motto
[08:30:09] <Mottie> lol
[08:31:45] <iaj> Is there a way to attach an click event to a background image?  thats set via background: ??
[08:32:12] <NoiseEee> iaj: you would set the click event on the element *with* the background image, and then change it
[08:32:21] <nerk> attach the event to the element containg the bg image
[08:32:27] <nerk> yah
[08:32:32] <nerk> what he said
[08:32:42] <iaj> mmm.. ok the background image is only like 32px32px
[08:32:54] <iaj> basically just an expand symbol...
[08:32:59] <nerk> then position absolute an event element
[08:33:06] <iaj> so I'd need to add that with <immmg>
[08:33:07] <nerk> that changes that small portion of the larget element
[08:33:10] <iaj> <img>
[08:33:30] <iaj> ok... how do I access its parent?
[08:33:41] <nerk> an img tag is probably your best candidate, if you are dealing with a tiny bg on a larger element.
[08:33:53] <nerk> the bg graphic is probably the wrong implementation for your needs
[08:34:01] <iaj> yeah
[08:34:04] <nerk> $(element).parent()
[08:34:12] <iaj> I figured that... alright... thanks nerk
[08:34:25] <iaj> will do it after I head home
[08:34:39] <nerk> if you have to write a lot of code to achieve something.. usually the root implementation is the issue
[08:35:13] <iaj> Oh and how would I change the image when its clicked?
[08:35:17] <Nivery> getting object has no method 'anything slider' trying to use a content slider. jquery is definitely defined and the appropriate js and css are definitely loaded at the time of the call (used a breakpoint to verify this)
[08:35:20] <Nivery> sort of at a loss
[08:35:36] <nerk> just call .attr('src','path/to/new/image.gif');
[08:36:14] <nerk> Nivery: sounds like a plugin?
[08:36:19] <Mottie> Nivery: which object/method?
[08:36:23] <Nivery> right jerk
[08:36:26] <Nivery> nerk, lol
[08:36:29] <Mottie> LOL
[08:36:30] <Nivery> sorry!
[08:36:38] <nerk> I am not sure if people support plugins here
[08:36:39] <Nivery> definitely not intentional
[08:36:42] <nerk> heh.. now I am a jerk :P
[08:36:48] <Nivery> that's fair enough
[08:36:51] <Mottie> <- maintains AnythingSlider
[08:36:57] <nerk> there you go
[08:37:00] <Mottie> lol
[08:37:04] <Nivery> i have used it successfully in the past
[08:37:17] <Nivery> i'm just not sure what else to try
[08:37:33] <Mottie> Nivery: first thing, make sure you don't have multiple copies of jQuery loaded on the page
[08:38:18] <Nivery> Mottie: i have definitely checked this (one of the few things i knew to do)
[08:38:42] <Mottie> Nivery: what is the error exactly?
[08:38:54] <Nivery> good ol' object has no method anythingslider
[08:39:17] <nerk> do you have jquery namespaced?
[08:39:25] <nerk> sounds like the plugin is not even attached to jQuery
[08:39:44] <Nivery> i know jquery works in the scope i'm making the call to anything slider in, i suppose
[08:39:52] <nerk> namespacing can be an issue if the plugin author didnt create a $ -> jQuery closure
[08:40:04] <Mottie> do you see anything if you type this into the console? "$.fn.anythingSlider"
[08:40:14] <Mottie> nerk: LOL it's in a closure
[08:40:20] <nerk> ok
[08:40:22] <Nivery> undefined
[08:40:27] <nerk> Mottie: good job
[08:40:36] <Nivery> it shows us as loaded in google's dev tools,t hough
[08:40:37] <Mottie> ok check that the plugin is being loaded
[08:40:50] <Mottie> correct url and everything?
[08:41:10] <Nivery> status 200 at least
[08:41:10] <docmur> I have two questions, one if I broken up jquery in several different <script> takes can I do a selector like var signUp-Box = $('#signup-Box'); and access it in each code block with out redefining it and second I have a pop up box that has required fields and when I hide it if you haven't entered stuff in the box the please fill this in is at the top of the screen, is there a way to get rid of that
[08:41:26] <Mottie> Nivery: are you using Chrome?
[08:41:27] <iaj> nerk, $(this).parent().nextAll().slideToggle();    how do I get all div-childs from the parent?
[08:41:30] <Nivery> i have anythingSlider on the server
[08:41:33] <Nivery> Mottie: yes
[08:41:44] <Nivery> i feel certain i am omitting something...
[08:41:59] <nerk> $(this).parent().children('div'); I believe
[08:42:11] <Mottie> Nivery: click on the Resources tab > Frames > Scripts , then make sure you see jquery.anythingslider.js in there
[08:43:04] <Nivery> Mottie: its jquery.anythingslider.min.js, but yes
[08:43:33] <Mottie> ok are you calling it with the correct camel case? small "a", capital "S"? anythingSlider
[08:43:44] <nerk> iaj: you can just use siblings() though
[08:43:47] <Nivery> Mottie: i am
[08:43:50] <nerk> $(this).siblings('div');
[08:44:06] <nerk> less traversing
[08:44:16] <iaj> hmm actually I'd need to up to the parent
[08:44:20] <iaj> then down into fieldset
[08:44:27] <iaj> then those divs inside the feldset
[08:44:35] <iaj> fieldset* omg, sorry
[08:44:44] <Mottie> Nivery: is jQuery defined then? type in "$.fn.jquery" into your console, it should return a version number
[08:44:55] <nerk> sounds like you could do $(this).siblings('fieldset').children('div');
[08:45:21] <Nivery> Mottie: hmmâ€¦ 1.9.0, it says
[08:45:27] <Nivery> Mottie: could that be an issue?
[08:45:30] <nerk> you might also want to look at filter()
[08:45:49] <Mottie> Nivery: it shouldn't be, and "$.fn.anythingSlider" is undefined?
[08:46:20] <Nivery> Mottie, correct
[08:46:42] <Mottie> Nivery: that still sounds like 2 copies of jQuery are running, or the script isn't loading correctly
[08:46:43] <iaj> $(this).siblings('fieldset').children('div').slideToggle();    trying that now but it doesn't have any effect
[08:46:57] <nerk> you might want to play in console.
[08:47:05] <iaj> $("legend img").click(function() {
[08:47:07] <iaj> above it..
[08:47:08] <iaj> ok
[08:47:12] <iaj> good hint :)
[08:47:12] <nerk> make sure first, that $(this).siblings('fieldset') works
[08:47:27] <iaj> hmm but how do I get the $(this) ?
[08:47:47] <nerk> not with this.. you'd have to target the element that represents this
[08:47:59] <iaj> k :)
[08:48:24] <Nivery> Mottie: i was mistaken -- the jquery version is actually 1.3.2
[08:48:27] <nerk> sometimes I spend time formatting my logic in console.. then translate it into code after
[08:49:51] <iaj> nerk: yeh.. I didn't think about that one, really:)
[08:49:52] <iaj> $('.slide img').siblings('fieldset').children('div').slideToggle()
[08:50:08] <iaj> works on console.. so now its only the other part to figure out :)
[08:50:19] <nerk> there you go :)
[08:50:35] <iaj> but the $('.slide img').click(function() { part is correct right?
[08:50:57] <nerk> can you create a pastebin somewhere?
[08:51:02] <nerk> jsfiddle perhaps?
[08:51:48] <Mottie> Nivery: AnythingSlider needs jQuery 1.4.2+ =(
[08:52:07] <Nivery> Mottie: ok!  i will correct this
[08:52:19] <Nivery> Nivery: thank you for your help!
[08:52:25] <Nivery> Mottie: thank you for your help!
[08:52:25] <iaj> haha.. got it nerk.. I did the $('slide img') part BEFORE i actaully inserted the img via .append('img...')
[08:52:29] <Nivery> lol -- not my day
[08:52:40] <Mottie> Nivery: LOL np
[08:52:45] <nerk> iaj: great!
[08:54:52] <iaj> nerk: now only the toggling of the image missing, it should be either open.png or closed.png... do I need an ifcase here?
[08:55:05] <Mottie> Nivery: LOL I haven't tested it in a while, but it looks like it still works with jQuery 1.3.2 if you just use the basics functionality
[08:55:32] <Mottie> Nivery: last thing, is jQuery loaded before AnythingSlider?
[08:55:49] <nerk> iaj: not sure about the logic of the code you have in place, a jsfiddle would help with that
[08:57:08] <Nivery> Mottie: definitely.  the error i'm now getting is 'object has no function delegate'
[08:57:23] <Nivery> Mottie: this is with 1.3.2
[08:57:38] <Nivery> $.fn.anythingSlider now returns something
[08:59:21] <Mottie> Nivery: whew ok
[09:07:09] <ryfish> I would like a div  background to scale nicely with size of the div
[09:07:17] <ryfish> I want to use something like svg
[09:07:28] <ryfish> I need it to work in browsers such as IE8
[09:07:35] <ryfish> how do I do this?
[09:12:23] <Mottie> Nivery: Hmm, in the latest version, I don't think delegate is used anymore... try updating AnythingSlider if you still have to use jQuery v1.3.2
[09:13:10] <Nivery> Mottie: will do!
[09:23:44] <jeffreylevesque> can someone tell me why my play.bind('click' doesn't pause the rotator:
[09:23:46] <jeffreylevesque> http://jsfiddle.net/yXWht/12/
[09:25:07] <jeffreylevesque> http://jsfiddle.net/yXWht/13/, rather
[09:30:35] <bil`> is there a method to further specify a data attribute.. this seems a tad messy like this: $questionsBankItems.find('[data-question-id=' + qBank.deleteQuestionID + ']')
[09:31:37] <bil`> id love to just pass the ID as a sole parameter or osmehting
[09:32:25] <raj> shoky, ping
[09:37:41] <Mottie> LMAO...  NOTE: eVetRecs is compatible ONLY with IE v 4.5 - 8.0  http://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records/
[09:41:50] <nerk> Mottie: lol. wow
[09:45:09] <kelye> here's a hard one ... (for me at least) ... I have a global 'blur' event handler
[09:45:42] <kelye> how can I stop that event if the next action is clicking on a button ?
[09:46:24] <kelye> so I have an input field that's focused .. and then the user clicks on 'Submit'
[09:48:50] <Mottie> kelye: check the target in the blur event.... $(document).blur(function(e){ if (e.target.id === buttonID ) { return false; } doSomethingElse(); });
[09:49:08] <Brodingo> kelye and you shouldn't bind form submission handlers with click, use submit
[09:49:38] <kelye> thank you, the form submission was an example
[09:50:02] <kelye> in fact it has nothing binded
[09:50:43] <thaifood> hi, Can anyone take a quick look and explain to me how "setGridParam" passes the data from master to child in this example ? http://www.trirand.com/blog/phpjqgrid/examples/selection/masterdetail/default.php
[09:50:54] <thaifood> the PHP tab has the code
[09:51:33] <Dieterbe> hey, i need to compute a mapping from a string to a hex color code. i was thinking md5 and then only keeping the first 6 chars, but it looks like i would need an md5 plugin for jquery so that's a bit overkill... anyone has a better idea?
[09:57:02] <kelye> Mottie: that's not working .. the target of blur is my input field
[09:59:04] <Mottie> kelye: target the input then... sorry I have to run real quick
[09:59:07] <Mottie> bbiab
[09:59:22] <kelye> ok, bye, ty
[10:01:34] <klusias> hello. can u please explain me what means "(function(f){})(jQuery);". how this functional block is called in javascript syntax? i understand its definition of jquery plugin, but what is parameter f and what is "(jQuery)"? just from theoretical aspect?
[10:01:53] <lil-murph> sure
[10:02:01] <sunbeam> hi, i have got a search page, when normally searching the action of <form> is myurl.com/search when the input field is filled in that adds myurl.com/?s=someword - now with jquery I would like to add something after this, how can I do this?
[10:02:10] <lil-murph> function (f) {} declares a function that takes one argument, f
[10:02:37] <lil-murph> you wrap it in parenthesis b/c javascript has a silly error in it's grammer, then you put () after it to call it like you would any function
[10:03:08] <lil-murph> lastly, you put jQuery into the arguments list, so argument 'f' gets 'jQuery'
[10:03:47] <klusias> lil-murph, ok, and whats if jQuery is not defined? it throws error or no?
[10:04:42] <lil-murph> yes
[10:04:57] <lil-murph> it'd throw a ReferenceError
[10:05:19] <sunbeam> Anyone ?
[10:05:20] <lil-murph> jQuery, btw, is defined when you load jQuery. Most people just use it by it's alias $.
[10:05:44] <lil-murph> sunbeam: add a 'hidden' type input and use jquery to modify it's value
[10:05:49] <kreeki> Hi guys, I've run into situation where I do cross domain ajax calls using CORS. I need to transmit cookies to the server so I set {xhrFields: {withCredentials: true }}, now everything works great. But Im building an Ember.js application and Ember's datastore is using jquery to communicate to REST APIs, but doesn't set withCredentials property. Can this be somehow set globally for all ajax calls? Couldnt find a way to do that in $.ajaxS
[10:06:30] <klusias> lil-murph, ok, then basically ( and ) around function are needed to pass jQuery reference?
[10:07:12] <sunbeam> lil-murph: how do you mean? I already have the string that I want to add
[10:07:23] <sunbeam> lil-murph: ohh like that
[10:09:04] <sunbeam> lil-murph: but when i add this to the search, i will get something like ?s=something&hidden_field=etc
[10:09:07] <sunbeam> right?
[10:09:09] <lil-murph> klusias: sec
[10:09:12] <lil-murph> sunbeam: yeah
[10:10:05] <lil-murph> klusias: http://jsfiddle.net/S7CQn/1/ <-- see if that explains it a bit better
[10:10:46] <kelye> for the record.. i've setup a timeout on blur, canceling if my special button is clicked
[10:10:48] <klusias> <lil-murph, big thanks, thats what i wanted to know
[10:11:07] <lil-murph> np
[10:12:50] <sunbeam> lil-murph: i just want ?s=something+etc,etc
[10:13:16] <sunbeam> lil-murph: any idea how I would do that?
[10:14:30] <lil-murph> sunbeam: ah. You could add a click listener to the button and then modify the value of s
[10:14:48] <sunbeam> lil-murph: yea thats an idea
[10:15:00] <sunbeam> lil-murph: should i just append?
[10:15:13] <sunbeam> like $("#s").val("etc"); ?
[10:15:27] <sunbeam> or how do I append it to whats already filled in at $("#s).val() ?
[10:15:47] <freeed> sunbeam, return false on submission and use jquery to append a value to the input .val() and then run $(form_name).submit()
[10:16:13] <lil-murph> yup. can you do .val().append()? /me forgets
[10:16:45] <sunbeam> freeed: why return false?
[10:16:56] <sunbeam> i mean why not first setting it, and then just letting the form do what its supposed to do
[10:17:05] <tw2113> preventDefault() is better
[10:17:27] <freeed> sunbeam, because the form will submit before you can append your value
[10:18:39] <sunbeam> $('.advanced-form').submit(function() { // do something }
[10:18:42] <sunbeam> is what I use now
[10:20:08] <sunbeam> freeed: should I initially use $(".advanced-form").click ?
[10:21:59] <freeed> sunbeam, nah.. you'd want to use the submit event, like so: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6462143/prevent-default-on-form-submit-jquery
[10:22:18] <tkeith> In $.ajax requests, can I specify HTTP auth information with https://user:pass@host/... as the URL?
[10:22:34] <freeed> sunbeam, e.preventDefault() would also work.. either or
[10:23:43] <freeed> tkeith, should be able to
[10:24:08] <tkeith> freeed: Ok, if I get a 401 at that point will it pop up the box? Is there a way to prevent that?
[10:24:35] <freeed> tkeith, probably not.. you'd have to watch the request in your console and see
[10:24:57] <tkeith> freeed: Probably won't pop up the box?
[10:25:12] <freeed> yeah.. don't see how it could :\
[10:25:29] <sunbeam> freeed: and then in the same function submit it?
[10:25:45] <tkeith> freeed: Ok, that's the behavior I hoped for
[10:25:46] <freeed> sunbeam, yeah after you append your other text
[10:25:49] <sunbeam> ok
[10:26:07] <sunbeam> $("#s").val().append(optionTexts);
[10:26:09] <freeed> tkeith I could be wrong.. just never tried it
[10:26:11] <sunbeam> this doesn't work for me
[10:26:16] <sunbeam> freeed: any idea how I can best doj this?
[10:26:48] <freeed> sunbeam, val() returns the val.. you would need to do something like .val($(this).val() + 'something') to change the val
[10:26:51] <thaifood> hi, Can anyone take a quick look and explain to me how "setGridParam" passes the data from master to child in this example ? http://www.trirand.com/blog/phpjqgrid/examples/selection/masterdetail/default.php   the PHP tab has the code
[10:29:58] <tomasm-> hi, I have an unordered list, one has the class 'selected'. I'm curious how I find out the index of that item. I've tried $("#leftnav li").index('.selected'), but get back -1
[10:30:23] <tomasm-> I see the ".index(selector)" is documented, so I dont get it
[10:41:05] <sunbeam> $("#s").val($(this).val() + 'something');
[10:41:15] <sunbeam> freeed: with this its empty
[10:43:30] <freeed> sunbeam, yeah it probably needs something like $(this).find(input[name=fieldname]).val()
[10:44:08] <sunbeam> yep sec
[10:44:23] <sunbeam> btw
[10:44:26] <sunbeam> $('[name*="tags"]:checked').each(function() { var tag = $(this).val(); optionTexts.push(tag); });
[10:44:29] <sunbeam> whats wrong with this?
[10:48:56] <dublee> Hello everyone
[10:50:01] <StephenS> hi
[10:50:57] <dublee> as far as uploading with jquery everyone would probably recommend using a plugin right?
[10:54:43] <thaifood> Anyone here use jqSuite ?
[10:57:29] <dublee> I've managed to get my jquery/ajax to upload a file but i'm curious how i could use the same code to upload 2 different files and help display them IE picture 1 and picture 2
[11:04:12] <dublee> nvm
[11:04:15] <dublee> i'll just make it bloated
[11:04:21] <dublee> so much for write less do more
[11:06:22] <amh345> i want to prevent someone from rapidly hitting a click event on a div.  it sends requests to my server each time. what's the best method to achieve this?   bind unbind?
[11:07:35] <pskli> I'd use a timer to set a global variable to true/false and add a condition to the click event
[11:07:43] <pskli> but there might be a more efficient way maybe
[11:09:26] <amh345> pskli: i see some posts on stackoverflow suggesting that method.  i just want to know if that's the ideal or if there's a better way
[11:10:28] <NoiseEee> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/ @ amh345
[11:11:19] <amh345> NoiseEee: thanks for the link.  checking it now
[11:14:43] <bahamas> if I want to bind a handler to the click event of all the <a> elements in a list, do I do $('ul#foo a').click(handler)?
[11:14:51] <deshymers> Bit of an odd issue. I built a simple slider, but when I use .show or .hide it brings the slider back into view if the person is scroll down past it, any suggestions?
[11:16:08] <pskli> deshymers:  is your slider absolute/fixed positioned ?
[11:16:29] <Industrial> Can I search for elements with an attribute name (<-- important, not the value, so not [a^=b]) starting with e.g. 'data-bind-' ?
[11:16:49] <deshymers> pskli: nope, not the part I am showing/hiding
[11:17:04] <pskli> do you have a live site to share?
[11:17:30] <deshymers> I wish :s client is a pita
[11:18:33] <pskli> do you mean that if your .show() your slider, the viewport gets scrolled back to where the slider is ?
[11:18:33] <deshymers> ahh I have a set of links below my slider image that I am changing the class on, and they are positioned absolute
[11:19:49] <deshymers> pskli: yes the viewport gets changed, but its not the show/hide function like I thought its the remove/addClass doing a quick test to confirm
[11:20:25] <DavidSullivan> Industrial, yes $('div[data-bind]')
[11:21:48] <deshymers> yup it is the removeClass and addClass methods
[11:21:55] <DavidSullivan> Industrial, now if you are looking for data-bind-foo and data-find-bar then thats different
[11:22:09] <DavidSullivan> Industrial, you would need to apply a filter to that
[11:22:33] <Industrial> DavidSullivan, yes
[11:22:43] <DavidSullivan> Industrial, http://stackoverflow.com/a/9543793/295800
[11:23:00] <Industrial> I was about to embark on a .firstElementChild and .nextElementSibling adventure ..
[11:23:36] <Industrial> nice, thanks
[11:23:59] <DavidSullivan> Industrial, the [name] slector is slow, the filter method is slower
[11:24:03] <deshymers> pskli: any tips on a fix for this?
[11:24:19] <pskli> hmm
[11:24:22] <DavidSullivan> Industrial, try to do anything you can to narrow it down first
[11:24:35] <DavidSullivan> ?toggleClass
[11:24:36] <bot-t> .toggleClass(className): Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[11:24:56] <Industrial> I'm writing model view bindings, so I need data-bind-value="val" and also data-bind-src="image_url"
[11:25:58] <Industrial> I guess, I want this fast.. while loops it is!
[11:26:05] <pskli> deshymers: not sure but try adding "top:auto;" to the added classes
[11:26:09] <Industrial> (I'm not a masochist)
[11:26:42] <DavidSullivan> Industrial, what api are you using knockout, backbone ?
[11:26:59] <deshymers> pskli: ok thanks
[11:28:21] <DavidSullivan> Industrial, also if you only need those 2 it might be faster to $('div[data-bind=src], div[data-bind-value])
[11:29:34] <DavidSullivan> Industrial, or better $('div').filter('[data-bind-src], [data-bind-value]')
[11:30:47] <Industrial> no, the src was just a usable example (image there, not its not)
[11:30:52] <Industrial> now its not*
[11:31:04] <Industrial> DavidSullivan, https://gist.github.com/be8b689b9f1a51011f23/6c9affed5000a3c8b8fa853c7efe6aeddf154645
[11:31:11] <Industrial> thats part of it, unfinished ofc :)
[11:33:04] <Industrial> DavidSullivan, hate it? :p
[11:33:14] <pskli> deshymers: did it help?
[11:33:21] <deshymers> nope :(
[11:34:05] <deshymers> if it helps I am doing http://phrogz.net/css/vertical-align/index.html (method 1) on a set of elements that are causing the issue
[11:34:17] <Mottie> *burp* good lunch
[11:34:32] <DavidSullivan> Industrial, so this is all server side node.js code
[11:35:08] <Industrial> no, except the server.ls, it's all client side code
[11:35:55] <Industrial> it does feature an auto-reconnecting old-client-dropping multiplexed RPC and data stream :X
[11:36:07] <Industrial> but I didnt write that ;)
[11:37:48] <Industrial> DavidSullivan, I plan to connect Model instances (by observable) to ModelView instances, so they can hold all the computed properties the db doesnt care about, and the Model's can care about client side validation and sending it off to the ModelAdapter, which serializes over the data stream or calls rpc save, i havent decided yet
[11:38:26] * DavidSullivan woooosh
[11:38:48] <Industrial> and then i use the same model on the server side to do validation there too, with the same code \o/
[11:39:11] <Industrial> It's mostly still in my head, and people have done this before. (derby.js)
[11:40:07] <Industrial> I just seem to like reinventing wheels ..
[11:44:38] <alaing> anyone here know how to use mocha?
[11:47:35] <StanAccy> With the datepicker, when Ive enabled changeYear, is it possible to make the dropdown selection scroll with the mouse?  Right now, its not at all clear to the end users that they can select years before 2003, since they are not visible on the initial popup, and there's no scroll indicator on the list of years
[11:49:29] <amh345> NoiseEee: have you used that particular debouncer with jquery 1.7?
[11:49:36] <DavidSullivan> someone give me a hand with a regex?   '.lbl-#{id}-#{name}'   need to match all instances of #{} and pull the value from between the {}
[11:49:52] <NoiseEee> amh345: i havent but it should be just fine
[11:50:07] <DavidSullivan> Industrial, ^^6
[11:50:57] <DavidSullivan> amh345, I havent used that but I have used lots of other things from Ben and they were all good
[11:51:12] <amh345> NoiseEee: i cant get it to function with on .on event https://gist.github.com/4693631
[11:52:51] <amh345> DavidSullivan: the debouncer works with a $('some_div').click( $.debounceâ€¦â€¦     but i cant get it to work with a $(document).on("click", "some_fdiv", function() { $.debounce(250, testDebounceFunction );  .....
[11:53:33] <DavidSullivan> amh345, are you creating the divs dynamically?
[11:53:45] <amh345> im trying to get the debouncer to function on an ajax div toggle. so i need to use the .on event.   maybe i could try the deprecated .live
[11:53:51] <amh345> DavidSullivan: , yes
[11:54:01] <amh345> and the toggle is sindie a parent div that is generated.
[11:54:05] <amh345> inside*
[11:54:48] <amh345> the function it calls is an $.ajax requst.
[11:55:47] <Mottie> DavidSullivan: do you have an actual example of the string you're matching?
[11:57:35] <festercluck> DavidSullivan: Possibly just a scope issue?
[11:57:48] <StanAccy> Is it possible to make the year selection dropdown/popup on a Datepicker scroll - is this a jquery "issue" or a plain HTML/CSS one?
[11:57:59] <festercluck> You wrapping everything?
[11:59:03] <pYr0x> hi... i have some issue with jquery mobile and the canJs router
[11:59:10] <pYr0x> you can see it on fiddle
[11:59:11] <pYr0x> http://jsfiddle.net/KFPSJ/5/
[11:59:36] <pYr0x> the problem is... that jqouery mobile remove the # in the location.hash
[11:59:56] <pYr0x> and the canJs router doesnt work
[12:01:21] <pYr0x> does anybody know how i can prevent this behavior
[12:02:11] <Mottie> pYr0x: maybe ask in the #canjs irc channel
[12:02:23] <festercluck> # never gets sent to the server, you sure?
[12:02:29] <pYr0x> i did... they say it is a problem on jquery mobile
[12:02:37] <festercluck> # and after
[12:03:18] <pYr0x> mottie: if i removed the jquery mobile the router will work
[12:04:04] <Mottie> pYr0x: sorry, I have no clue... they didn't even have a work around?... nice
[12:04:49] <pYr0x> no they have no workaround
[12:05:21] <pYr0x> so is there any option on jquery mobile to prevent this behavior
[12:05:35] <pYr0x> removing the # in location.hash
[12:09:15] <seba4_> hi 2 all. One question ... does anyone know where i could find jquery for galery slider based on mousemove
[12:14:03] <lil-murph> I've got an array of $.Deferred. How would I add a function as .fail for each (individually)
[12:14:07] <Mottie> pYr0x: Check out the Known limitations on this page: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a4.1/docs/pages/docs-navmodel.html the last line might have your solution
[12:15:05] <johnkpaul> lil-murph: $.map(yourArray, function(def){def.fail(yourFailHandler);})
[12:15:16] <lil-murph> ah. k :)
[12:15:55] <DavidSullivan> Mottie, need to turn    .lbl-#{id}-#{name} into .lbl-someid-somename
[12:16:13] <Mottie> DavidSullivan: like a template?
[12:16:29] <DavidSullivan> Mottie, yes, if you have a better delimeter that would be cool
[12:17:06] <DavidSullivan> I need to loop through the results and try to find the attribute on an element to put the string back together
[12:18:27] <Mottie> DavidSullivan: huh? put what string back together?
[12:19:53] <DavidSullivan> var matches = template.regMatch(????);   where matches winds up being an array of the items between #{}
[12:20:29] <DavidSullivan> Mottie, ^^
[12:24:56] <Mottie> DavidSullivan: hmm, ok I guess it would help if I had more examples.... what does "template" look like?
[12:25:30] <deshymers> pskli: I got the issue figured out, wasnt either of those methods
[12:26:15] <Mottie> DavidSullivan: can you make a demo on jsFiddle, please.
[12:26:31] <deshymers> I was doing a fadeIn/fadeOUt on some images, that were different height. But you wouldnt have knowen that unless I had this publicly available, but I do appreciate your help, so thanks!
[12:26:53] <pskli> oh that's normal behaviour then ;)
[12:26:54] <pskli> np!
[12:26:55] <Armistice> http://jsfiddle.net/xS3y8/ trying to do a basic ... slider/carousel style of thing, sure what I have works but you click previous many many times and you can click next as many times too .. despit ebeing no elements to display. How would I go about stopping that?
[12:27:02] <deshymers> haha
[12:29:12] <Armistice> I've seen a lot of scripts done for this but they are often very complex, support multiple animations and all I just want is a simple slide thats why I'm ... "reinventing the wheel" as you could say
[12:30:49] <deshymers> Armistice: after you move to the next pane see if there another pane to go to, if not then disable the next button
[12:30:56] <deshymers> havnt looked at your code yet either
[12:32:48] <Armistice> well that's what I don't understand, it's a ul that's got like a width of 1290% or something ridiculous, with all the li's inside.
[12:32:57] <Armistice> so there is no "panes" per say
[12:33:11] <vonseel> Is this a good place to ask for javascript help
[12:33:13] <vonseel> ?
[12:33:25] <Armistice> #javascript for javascript
[12:33:27] <Armistice> #jquery for jquery
[12:33:37] <deshymers> Armistice: you are showing a set number of li's per view, that would be one pane
[12:33:39] <vonseel> K, thanks. First-timer to IRC help here.
[12:33:49] <deshymers> atleast thats where i would start, may be a better approach
[12:35:33] <Armistice> so I need to keep track of the index of li's that are shown
[12:38:06] <bahamas> vonseel: join the #javascript channel for javascript questions
[12:38:20] <bahamas> oh, I misread what you said. never mind
[12:38:22] <vonseel> Thanks bahamas, am in there now.
[12:38:49] <vonseel> Is freenode a good server for other programming languages too?
[12:39:03] <jrockjiggz2> vonseel: yes
[12:39:42] <vonseel> Awesome, thanks.
[12:39:56] <bahamas> yes, it's especially used by software projects
[12:40:11] <bahamas> anyone have any idea why .live works in my code but .on doesn't?
[12:40:46] <bahamas> I'm using jquery 1.8.3
[12:42:06] <jrockjiggz2> bahamas: on() can be used different ways.
[12:42:34] <bahamas> jrockjiggz2: I'm using it in the same way as .live
[12:42:59] <bahamas> jrockjiggz2: in this case, it's about some elements that are added dynamically and I want to bind a handler to their "click" event
[12:43:08] <jrockjiggz2> $(document).on('click','.class', function(){})  <-- will bind any elements in the future
[12:43:09] <jrockjiggz2> whereas
[12:43:30] <jrockjiggz2> $('.class').on('click', function(){}); <-- will bind specific element once
[12:44:57] <bahamas> jrockjiggz2: so it won't work with elements added later?
[12:45:03] <bahamas> jrockjiggz2: the second one, I mean
[12:45:29] <jrockjiggz2> bahamas: correct
[12:46:09] <DavidSullivan> Mottie, http://jsbin.com/okurid/2/edit
[12:47:01] <Mottie> DavidSullivan: LOL ok now what do I put into the input string?
[12:48:09] <bahamas> jrockjiggz2: I see. thanks
[12:49:20] <DavidSullivan> Mottie, the thing is between the #{} could be any attribute of element http://jsbin.com/okurid/3/edit
[12:49:21] <bahamas> jrockjiggz2: btw, do you know the explanation for that behavior?
[12:49:42] <DavidSullivan> Mottie, and there could be more than 1 instance of #{}
[12:50:00] <bahamas> is it the fact, that the first case selects the existing elements and doesn't check again
[12:50:16] <bahamas> while the second selects the elements on each event trigger?
[12:50:23] <Mottie> DavidSullivan: class=".lbltest" is not a valid class name in the first place
[12:52:38] <DavidSullivan> Mottie, http://jsbin.com/okurid/5/edit
[12:52:41] <DavidSullivan> typo
[12:53:27] <Mottie> DavidSullivan: ok let me get this straight, if I enter "lbltest" into the input, it is trying to find the element with an id of "test"?
[12:54:52] <DavidSullivan> whats in the input has nothing to do with it.
[12:55:08] <DavidSullivan> Mottie, I am trying to find the label for the given input
[12:55:51] <Mottie> DavidSullivan: can't you just do $('#test').prev('label'); ?
[12:56:02] <DavidSullivan> but the standard select that you would use for that is just $('label[for="someid"]')
[12:57:36] <DavidSullivan> Mottie, nm
[12:57:55] <Mottie> DavidSullivan: LOL let me see what I can do
[13:00:13] <Dieterbe> hey, i need to compute a mapping from a string to a hex color code. i was thinking md5 and then only keeping the first 6 chars, but it looks like i would need an md5  plugin for jquery so that's a bit overkill... anyone has a better idea?
[13:03:03] <Armistice> How efficient is this for a slider/carousel: http://jsfiddle.net/xS3y8/2/ I think it works?
[13:03:08] <Armistice> Could have plenty of bugs tho
[13:03:23] <Armistice> I'm just curious why I see carousels very very complex but do the same thing...
[13:05:04] <DavidSullivan> Armistice, throw some vars in there so that you dont have to keeps searching for stuff
[13:05:52] <DavidSullivan> for example where you do $('.prev').att     if at the top of that function you declar var $prev = $(this);
[13:06:10] <DavidSullivan> other than that kinda thing looks cool
[13:06:11] <pYr0x> Mottie: what do mean?... last line? in with case can this help me
[13:07:17] <Armistice> Curious, howcome some vars are defined with with $ and others are not?
[13:07:20] <Armistice> what is special about the $ ?
[13:08:24] <DavidSullivan> I define all object that are jquery objects with a $       var $someselector =  $('someselector'),   var bool = false;
[13:09:01] <Armistice> I suppose that could make sense, I'm guessing how you use them would be personal preference?
[13:09:17] <DavidSullivan> completly
[13:09:37] <DavidSullivan> but it helps with my autocompletes in my ide as well
[13:13:08] <DavidSullivan> Armistice, http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/xS3y8/4/
[13:14:20] <Armistice> How would this be then DavidSullivan: http://jsfiddle.net/xS3y8/5/
[13:14:22] <Armistice> a nd with yours...
[13:14:57] <Armistice> I'm confused, $prev is defined as the .click same for $next so by doing $prev.removeAttr(...) it would be calling the .click?
[13:15:02] <Armistice> surely ...
[13:15:05] <scriptraptor> hi guys, what's the best way to find textarea name="foo" in a form #bar using $('#bar')?
[13:15:26] <Armistice> $('#bar textarea[name=foo]')
[13:15:30] <Armistice> could be one solution.
[13:15:55] <Mottie> pYr0x: Sorry, I've never used can.js before and hardly use jQuery mobile, so I can't help much more
[13:16:10] <DavidSullivan> $('.prev').click(function(){whatever}); returns the same as $('.prev')
[13:16:23] <DavidSullivan> Armistice, remember chainging in jquery
[13:16:52] <DavidSullivan> Armistice, both mine and your new one seem comptley the same although honesxtly your might be easier to read
[13:17:55] <Armistice> another could be var foo; $("#foo textarea").each(function() { if ($(this).attr("name") == "foo") foo = $(this); break; });
[13:17:58] <Armistice> but i prefer the first ;P
[13:18:48] <Armistice> and DavidSullivan right, so the .click kind of sets the callback for the event listener... and literally does nothing else.
[13:19:15] <Armistice> other than return the jq object.
[13:19:22] <Armistice> kinda makes sense that way
[13:19:29] <scriptraptor> Armistice: is there a way using find() or something if i need to keep $('#bar')?
[13:19:30] <thinboy> I implemented flexslider complext call: $(window).load(function() {
[13:19:30] <thinboy>   $('.flexslider').flexslider({
[13:19:30] <thinboy>     animation: "slide"
[13:19:31] <thinboy>   });
[13:19:31] <thinboy> }); but it is not working. Does anyone knows how to fix it?
[13:19:49] <pskli> any live example to help us out ?
[13:19:59] <Armistice> I think you can do this scriptrapter: $("#bar").find("textarea[name=foo]")
[13:20:05] <thinboy> If I switch to basic/simple call. It is working.
[13:20:07] <Armistice> Not tried it tho
[13:20:58] <thinboy> pskli: are u talking to me sir?
[13:21:07] <Armistice> the one problem with [...=...] kind of things is that they aren't supported on IE6, possibly IE7 but I guess to some people doesn't really matter. It somewhat matters to me, but usually i'm too lazy to care about IE6 users.
[13:21:11] <pskli> yes thinboy
[13:21:41] <DavidSullivan> scriptraptor, Armistice, you need " around the value $("#bar").find('textarea[name="foo"]')
[13:21:50] <Armistice> you do?
[13:21:51] <pskli> try inside a jQuery(document).ready(function(){ then
[13:21:57] <pskli> thinboy: try inside a jQuery(document).ready(function(){ then
[13:22:13] <thinboy> Okay
[13:22:27] <thinboy> pskli: thanks for that. I'll try
[13:22:42] <scriptraptor|2> sorry if anyone replied, my net just dropped
[13:23:56] <Armistice> http://jsfiddle.net/aqdyk/ apparently not, DavidSullivan? (working solution for scriptraptor|2 too)
[13:24:32] <DavidSullivan> Armistice, hmmm it musta changed in some version
[13:24:48] <scriptraptor|2> can i just do find('[name=foo]')?
[13:25:15] <DavidSullivan> scriptraptor|2, yes but it will be slower
[13:25:29] <DavidSullivan> Armistice, they both work http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/aqdyk/1/
[13:25:45] <scriptraptor|2> OK but I'm thinking in terms of if I don't know what it will be - and is there a difference of filter() and find()?
[13:26:10] <DavidSullivan> think older version required the value be quoted
[13:26:24] <Armistice> probably DavidSullivan I don't even think it's needed in css either though
[13:26:42] <Armistice> scriptraptor|2: What instance would you not know what kind of element your name attribute would be on/
[13:27:01] <DavidSullivan> scriptraptor|2, yes    $('li').filter('.highlighted');     $('li').find('a');
[13:27:01] <DavidSullivan> find looks for children
[13:27:35] <DavidSullivan> $("#bar textarea[name='foo']")
[13:27:44] <DavidSullivan> if you want to do it that way
[13:27:54] <Armistice> that was my first suggestion too but he wanted to keep $("#bar") for some reason
[13:28:26] <Armistice> even though $("#bar") won't ever disappear, really.
[13:28:26] <Armistice> unless you do .remove

[13:28:54] <scriptraptor|2> thanks david
[13:29:11] <Armistice> I think you're mistaking the use of jQuery.noConflict()
[13:29:20] <Armistice> jquery is already defined as $
[13:29:25] <DavidSullivan> ?paste@thinboy
[13:29:39] <scriptraptor|2> btw one question i have not yet asked. when i log the jq object i will get soemthing like $obj { 0:{/*stuff*/}, context:{/*stuff*/} };
[13:29:48] <thinboy> DavidSullivan: what do you mean?
[13:29:49] <scriptraptor|2> when would i use context instead of $obj[o]?
[13:29:54] <scriptraptor|2> $obj[0]*
[13:30:38] <DavidSullivan> ?botsnack
[13:30:38] <Armistice> thinboy: he means paste your code to a pastebin site in future ;)
[13:30:38] <Armistice> but the bot isn't responding ... by the looks of it.
[13:30:38] <Armistice> anyway, afk
[13:30:38] <thinboy> Armistice I need to do that, jQuery is defined as j$ in the site I am working on so I did that.
[13:30:38] <DavidSullivan> damn lazy bot
[13:31:02] <Armistice> oh before i go afk, thinboy could you upload a live example of this issue on jsfiddle perhaps
[13:31:20] <Armistice> nd if jquery is already defined as j$ why not use j$ instead of defining $ ?
[13:31:36] <scriptraptor|2> is context always the document summary?
[13:31:50] <thinboy> Armistice Ok.
[13:32:38] <thinboy> Armistice Thanks for the help. Btw, I am not sure how recreate a live example to jsfiddle. Havent used it before. Sorry Newbie.
[13:33:17] <Armistice> it's a neat tool thinboy, try it out ;) there are many options you can use and what frameworks etc. it's rather simple to use.
[13:33:40] <DavidSullivan> Armistice, have you tried jsbin.com
[13:33:45] <sqwk> How can I load a google api script using jquery. Currently doing this http://pastie.org/6023304 but would like to get rid of the extra function.
[13:34:02] <Armistice> i've come across it I believe DavidSullivan but I think I always preferred jsfiddle
[13:34:20] <DavidSullivan> the linting is broke for some reason for me
[13:34:46] <DavidSullivan> Armistice, in jsfiddle that is, hovering over the new red dots doesnt do anything for me
[13:35:04] <thinboy> Armistice Hmm. Just opened up jsfiddle. How can I create dummy images?
[13:35:43] <DavidSullivan> thinboy, http://www.webresourcesdepot.com/8-free-placeholder-image-services-for-instant-dummy-images/
[13:36:23] <DavidSullivan> ?botsnack
[13:36:23] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[13:37:29] <thinboy> thanks!
[13:39:23] <Mottie> DavidSullivan: sorry, I was still looking at the code you shared... it just gets really messy. I'm sure there are simplier ways to do it.
[13:39:42] <Mottie> <- has OCD LOL
[13:42:11] <DavidSullivan> ?paste@thinboy
[13:42:11] <bot-t> thinboy, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:42:23] <docmur> if I have a div called login-Box and I want to select a button inside that div and disable it, how would I do that?  $("#login-Box button").disable() doesn't work
[13:44:04] <Armistice> docmur .attr("disabled", "disabled");
[13:44:14] <Armistice> if you want to use .disable() you'd have to create your own little plugin just for it ;)
[13:44:14] <thinboy> How to see my code result in mobile vew through jsfiddle?
[13:44:36] <Armistice> see your pm thinboy
[13:45:10] <docmur> Prefect :-) thanks
[13:46:23] <scriptraptor|2> is there a jquery equivilent of .notEmpty or smth?
[13:46:29] <Armistice> to remove it, .removeAttr("disabled")
[13:47:58] <Armistice> check if the value is equal to ""
[13:48:08] <scriptraptor|2> and if i want the check the value is not "   "
[13:48:09] <scriptraptor|2> ?
[13:48:35] <Armistice> use .trim() on the value ;)
[13:48:48] <scriptraptor|2> ah ofc
[13:48:56] <scriptraptor|2> cookie for you, obvious
[13:49:24] <Armistice> ?botsnack
[13:49:24] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[13:49:34] <Armistice> he stole my cookie  ;/
[13:49:35] <bahamas> I'm modyfing an element by removing a class and adding another one and the pages scrolls to the top. anyone know the reason and how to stop it?
[13:50:01] <scriptraptor|2> preventDefault() i'm guessing your scroll is #hashtagism?
[13:50:03] <NoiseEee> bahamas: is it modified by clicking an <a> with href="#" ?
[13:50:11] <bahamas> NoiseEee: yes
[13:50:31] <bahamas> I am calling event.preventDefault()
[13:50:35] <NoiseEee> then what scriptraptor|2 said.  its the *clicking* taking you there, not any class removal/adding.  stop the event
[13:50:42] <NoiseEee> bahamas: not correctly i'd presume then ;)
[13:51:13] <Armistice> $("foo").click(function(e) { ... e.preventDefault(); });
[13:51:22] <bahamas> NoiseEee: I'm also doing a post. should I stop the event before the post?
[13:51:34] <thinboy> Armistice check your pm please :)
[13:51:52] <NoiseEee> bahamas: you should stop the event right away, really
[13:52:33] <sunbeam> hi, i'd like to add a string to input#s (search field)
[13:52:37] <sunbeam> any idea how I can best do this?
[13:52:41] <bahamas> NoiseEee: thought so
[13:52:51] <bahamas> thanks
[13:53:35] <bahamas> sunbeam: $('input#s').text('string') or something
[13:55:51] <sunbeam> bahamas: i want to add it next to whats already filled in there
[13:57:38] <DavidSullivan> var s = $('input#s').val(); $('input#s').text(val + 'string');
[13:57:44] <DavidSullivan> sunbeam, ^^^
[13:58:00] <DavidSullivan> if it is text input then you want val not text most likely
[13:58:33] <DavidSullivan> sunbeam, opps corrected var s = $('input#s').val(); $('input#s').val(val + 'string');
[13:59:41] <sunbeam> DavidSullivan: thanks
[14:03:12] <sunbeam> var tag = $(this).val(); optionTexts.push(tag);
[14:03:21] <sunbeam> is this the right way to add tag to this optiontexts var?
[14:03:23] <sunbeam> array i mean
[14:12:24] <Armistice> Hmm I wanted dto find out why I could not upgrade Safari on Windows. Apple has dropped Safari for windows completely which means I am unable to test my applications in Safari. That sucks.
[14:19:27] <sqwk> Why would .val('') not work to clear an input field?
[14:19:49] <tfitts> it should, are you sure you're targetting it correctly?
[14:28:23] <sunbeam> is it possible to exclude a field from a search?
[14:28:29] <sunbeam> for example name="tag[]" ?
[14:34:52] <sqwk> subbeam: .not(name="tag")
[14:35:21] <sqwk> tfitts: yes, everything else works, but the .val('')
[14:51:58] <xenaxon> hi
[14:52:19] <stacky> hi
[14:52:19] <xenaxon> how can I execute a function after ALL the content is loaded and in place?
[14:53:09] <xenaxon> the lists on the page are loading after their container, and are causing the container to stretch out
[14:53:31] <xenaxon> and I have a function that arranges the containers each in their own place
[14:53:51] <xenaxon> but because the lists are loaded after the container
[14:53:59] <xenaxon> the container stretches out, AFTER it has been placed
[14:54:02] <xenaxon> and overlaps
[14:54:05] <xenaxon> the next one
[14:54:27] <xenaxon> if I place my code at the bottom of the page, will it work?
[14:56:12] <adamovy> anyone tried sublime text3 ?
[15:03:52] <sunbeam> hi, i'd like to get the current path name before any get params
[15:03:54] <sunbeam> like http://myurl.com/dir/
[15:03:56] <sunbeam> and not
[15:03:58] <sunbeam> http://myurl.com/dir/?something
[15:04:57] <ajpiano> sunbeam: window.location.pathname
[15:05:43] <sunbeam> ajpiano: will that exclude ?something?
[15:06:16] <ajpiano> sunbeam: just look in your console :p
[15:06:16] <sunbeam> ajpiano: i also need the domain name
[15:06:23] <sunbeam> i only get the dir here, right?
[15:06:40] <ajpiano> window.location.origin + window.location.pathname
[15:06:49] <sunbeam> ok
[15:06:51] <sunbeam> thanks
[15:06:54] <sunbeam> i am using this to search
[15:07:01] <sunbeam> because i don't want the default get method posting
[15:07:21] <sunbeam> window.location.origin is undefined for me
[15:08:14] <grafi> domain name should be location.host, i think
[15:08:32] <jrockjiggz2> is there a way to trigger ajaxComplete()? I'm passing a callback function into success, and ajaxComplete() is fired before the callback is completed..
[15:08:56] <ajpiano> host works too
[15:09:02] <grafi> if in doubt check out what attributes the location object provides ^^
[15:09:05] <ajpiano> just look at the window.location object in the console
[15:09:11] <sunbeam> ok
[15:09:18] <grafi> reading my mind ajpiano
[15:09:39] <sunbeam> 'http://' + location.host + window.location.pathname
[15:09:40] <sunbeam> like this?
[15:10:14] <grafi> thats assuming the protocol is alway http
[15:11:51] <tw2113> ''//'+location.host + window.location.pathname
[15:11:59] <tw2113> somehow i got an extra '
[15:12:03] <sunbeam> ok thanks guys
[15:12:07] <sunbeam> i am using this to search
[15:12:11] <sunbeam> is that a bad practice or?
[15:12:17] <sunbeam> to submit a search
[15:12:31] <grafi> submit a search?
[15:12:43] <sunbeam> yes
[15:12:48] <grafi> how do you mean?
[15:12:56] <sunbeam> as i say
[15:13:15] <tw2113> he needs more details on the process
[15:13:27] <tw2113> he can't picture an example
[15:13:31] <sunbeam> I need to get all the checkboxes values that are checked
[15:13:37] <danheberden> tw2113: lol i was hoping to see how long this would go
[15:13:54] <sunbeam> and then add that to the input search field
[15:22:32] <sunbeam> whats the best way to forward to another site?
[15:22:42] <sunbeam> location.href = 'http://www.url.com' ?
[15:24:43] <jrockjiggz2> I'm passing a callback function into ajax's success callback, i'm finding my callback is asynchronious and the ajax complete is fired before my callback in complete... not sure how to get around this
[15:40:55] <tds5016> hi. I have a sortable that I'm able to drag outside of the list...
[15:41:21] <tds5016> I append the list to the parent div...
[15:41:54] <tds5016> but the containment is about 50 pixels to the left of the actual div.
[15:42:03] <tds5016> any ideas what could be causing that?
[15:42:29] <list> !ciao
[15:42:37] <tds5016> top and bottom containments are fine.
[15:42:41] <list> !list
[15:45:46] <paul147> anybody know the most correct way to change the source of an img tag?
[15:48:17] <paul147> nevermind, that wasn't my problem, it was the selector i was using :P
[15:58:27] <jrockjiggz2> Hi, i've recreated my ajax issue.. I have a custom callback fired in the success callback.. the problem is ajaxComplete fires before the custom callback is complete.. i'm not sure how to use deffereds.. http://jsfiddle.net/49QXY/1/
[15:59:20] <jrockjiggz2> fix http://jsfiddle.net/49QXY/2/
[16:01:09] <vecinu2012> Has anyone tried using the PicNet Table Filter plugin?
[16:01:32] <vecinu2012> I've hooked onto my table but I get TypeError: this.$pnforEach$ is not a function
[16:01:57] <jrockjiggz2> hopefully this is more clear: http://jsfiddle.net/49QXY/5/
[16:02:16] <hateIE> there was once upoun a time a developer who was working on a website and he was trying to link a iframe to editdjs.php but unknowningly the developer had accidentally called the file editidjs.php and because of the small font in his ftp program he could not work out for 2 hours why editdjs.php never existed
[16:04:00] <hateIE> that developer was some other guy not me ;]
[16:05:30] <TelFiRE> Don't feel bad, I missed the "g" in backround once and spent more time than that
[16:07:17] <vecinu2012> Anyone?
[16:09:38] <jrockjiggz2> anyone use Deferred() ? trying to get it to work in this example http://jsfiddle.net/49QXY/6/
[16:28:40] <tds5016> anyone know why when I have a sortable, It hsa the horizontal containment off by about 50px?
[16:32:26] <shoky> jrockjiggz2: the problem is that you only change the .html() after 200 ms when the fade-in is complete
[16:32:58] <shoky> jrockjiggz2: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/49QXY/8/
[16:35:05] <tds5016> any ideas what I could even look into to figure out what is causing this?
[16:35:30] <tds5016> eturn _this.currentPresentation.personalSlides[ui.index()].getSlideAsImageObject(); that's my helper
[16:35:35] <tds5016> if that helps at all.
[16:35:43] <tds5016> actually... that wouldn't. sorry.
[16:36:21] <shoky> ?demo @ tds5016
[16:36:21] <b-ot> tds5016: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:36:21] <bot-t> tds5016, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:36:31] <shoky> eh
[16:37:18] <tds5016> shoky: I would.... but there is a lot here that would have to go up for a demo.
[16:37:45] <tds5016> can you amybe point out some things that MIGHt cause this behavior to help me debug? I'm sorry.
[16:38:03] <tds5016> AKA I don't think I can make a simple demo that would create this behavior.
[16:38:47] <tds5016> basically though, I have one draggable, and one sortable. when I drag into the sortable, and then I try to drag the sortable, it won't let me move the newly created sortable object to the right.
[16:38:53] <tds5016> it will let me move it to the left, up and down.
[16:39:11] <tds5016> and it looks as though the containment is just shifted to the left like 150px.
[16:40:07] <tds5016> even when I put the object on the body object with appendTo: 'body'; containment: 'parent'
[16:41:39] <tds5016> does what I'm saying even make sense?
[16:48:09] <shoky> sorry.. can't visualize it
[16:48:31] <shoky> not enough to guess at any cause, anyways
[16:49:14] <shoky> demo/link ;p
[16:50:26] <tds5016> no worries. thanks anyhow. I'll play some more,
[16:51:19] <tds5016> apparently it's a problem with a list object having a margin of 0px auto
[16:56:02] <tds5016> shoky: do you know how to remove the margins from the helper?
[16:56:23] <tds5016> .css('margin', '0px'); appeats not to work.
[16:56:43] <shoky> see last thing i said ;p
[17:01:11] <xenaxon> how to do default after event.preventDefault();
[17:01:12] <xenaxon> ?
[17:01:44] <shoky> xenaxon: you don't. avoid calling preventDefault() if you're not sure you want to prevent
[17:01:54] <xenaxon> I want to prevent
[17:01:58] <xenaxon> then do an action
[17:02:04] <xenaxon> then do the default after the action has been done
[17:02:12] <xenaxon> catch me?
[17:02:28] <shoky> what are you preventing
[17:02:40] <xenaxon> I'm preventing an anchor from switching pages
[17:02:49] <xenaxon> because I want to do an action before it does that
[17:02:54] <xenaxon> onpage
[17:03:11] <shoky> you can later just redirect the page
[17:03:18] <shoky> location.href = whatever
[17:03:21] <shoky> or smth
[17:04:18] <shoky> or location.replace()
[17:04:25] <xenaxon> ...
[17:04:31] <xenaxon> It needs to be clean
[17:04:41] <xenaxon> is that clean for search engines?
[17:05:49] <tds5016> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/Ddd9r/
[17:05:57] <tds5016> that's KIND of what is happening, but not exactly.
[17:06:05] <tds5016> I think that would probably have the same root cause.
[17:10:50] <tds5016> shoky: do you see the issue
[17:15:07] <tds5016> shoky: found it...
[17:15:10] <tds5016> it wanted display: inline-block;
[17:16:23] <shoky> i tried that, didn't help in the fiddle..
[17:16:41] <shoky> but this did http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Ddd9r/1/
[17:17:16] <tds5016> shoky: nice. kinda cheating, but I'll give it to ya.
[17:17:22] <tds5016> :-D THANKS!
[17:17:29] <shoky> np ;p
[17:18:10] <shoky> xenaxon: donno about SEO.. but if the search engine sees the href attribute on the <a> then it knows there's a link.. javascript shouldn't matter even if it prevents the original click..
[17:18:25] <shoky> or so i suppose
[17:19:27] <tds5016> now to figure out how to get touchtpunch to stop registering my intial finger placement as touch drag, because the ipad things "I don't know where you're dragging, let's place the cursor in a random position"
[17:19:31] <tds5016> ...thanks ios...
[17:19:32] <tds5016> haha.
[17:19:50] <shoky> ;S
[17:33:40] <tomasm-> is there a way to have jquery trigger a browser paste, ie CTRL-V ?
[17:36:33] <nextime> i don't think so as i see it as a very dangerous vulnerability to permit that
[17:43:17] <tds5016> hey. is there a way to change the cursor on an object you're dragging?
[17:43:21] <tds5016> wihtout using the cursor: option?
[17:43:33] <tds5016> I want to change the cursor to a delete cursor when they drag out of a div.
[17:44:11] <tds5016> ui.helper[0].css('cursor', 'url(images/trash_icon.png)');
[17:44:13] <tds5016> is that correct?
[17:44:22] <tds5016> because it doesn't appear to be working :-/.
[17:49:35] <Columcille> tds5016: coming from js, try the full url?
[17:51:51] <tds5016> Columcille: no luck.
[17:51:59] <tds5016> thanks for trying though.
[17:56:54] <tds5016> now it worked. no idea why all of a sudden, but I'm not going to complain :-)
[18:01:46] <tds5016> ...needs the ,auto
[18:16:15] <raj> shoky, still around?
[18:19:02] <tds5016> is there a way to set the sort tolerance to be pointer, and the out/over tolerance to be intersect?
[18:25:23] <luigi69> Good morning.
[18:25:42] <raj> good morning
[18:26:49] <luigi69> http://pastebin.com/91apN4eF
[18:27:15] <luigi69> Why does the loading occure before `#outer-container` is fully faded?
[18:27:26] <luigi69> Ajax loading.
[18:27:55] <luigi69> When this snipped is runned it works like this: Fading starts, i see new content loaded via ajax, fading complets -> console.log fires.
[18:28:17] <luigi69> While I would expect that ajax should be fired with the console.
[18:40:24] <relipse> is there a quick way to grab all form values and pass it in an array value for php to recognize?
[18:47:53] <DukeDrake> hi
[18:48:15] <DukeDrake> how can I find the next input from $(this) ?
[18:48:25] <DukeDrake> ($(this) bein an input
[18:48:49] <luigi69> DukeDrake - are they siblings?
[18:49:03] <DukeDrake> not really :/
[18:49:19] <luigi69> DukeDrake - do you know their common parent?
[18:49:28] <DukeDrake> yes :}
[18:51:02] <DukeDrake> can I get the index of the current input or something?
[18:52:10] <DukeDrake> so I cen select like $('input')[curindex+1] ?
[18:52:19] <DukeDrake> *can
[18:52:34] <luigi69> DukeDrake - http://api.jquery.com/index/
[18:53:10] <DukeDrake> yay =)
[18:54:25] <luigi69> DukeDrake - If you have something like each input inside its own paragraph or div there might be an easier way to do it.
[18:54:42] <luigi69> Is that the case?
[18:54:53] <DukeDrake> not really
[18:54:58] <DukeDrake> it's a table
[18:54:59] <luigi69> Nvm then :D
[18:55:14] <luigi69> So each input is inside its own cell?
[18:55:45] <luigi69> And you want input from the next cell?
[18:56:52] <luigi69> $(this).parent('td').next('td').find('input') - could work ni that situation.
[19:08:09] <DukeDrake> hm
[19:08:25] <DukeDrake> it worked with the index thing ..... well ...
[19:08:53] <DukeDrake> however, I'd like to set the cursor to that field .... without using focus() >.>
[19:13:52] <otherj> what's wrong with .focus()?
[19:15:03] <DukeDrake> in my case it's actually messing up the focus on the viewport
[19:19:39] <relipse> does anyone know how to change a jqueryui dialog button listed in 'buttons: {}' ?
[19:24:51] <lil-murph> Is there a good plugin or something to do code coverage with QUnit?
[19:26:11] <relipse>  what is the jquery way to array_merge two js objects?
[19:32:20] <delinquentme_> http://jsfiddle.net/hW5En/  << I think I'm missing something as far as scope is concerned here...
[19:33:25] <jrajav> delinquentme_: selected_ecosystem_names is an implicit global in your code
[19:33:33] <jrajav> Slap a var on that nasty thing
[19:34:21] <delinquentme_> jrajav, doesn't fix the undefined issues on the return
[19:35:25] <jrajav> Try .push() instead.
[19:36:49] <delinquentme_> jrajav, nooope
[19:37:37] <jrajav> Oh - You're using the collection version of each()
[19:37:52] <jrajav> Do $(ecosystems_at_this_location).each(function() { instead
[19:38:15] <jrajav> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/ vs. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[19:38:38] <delinquentme_> still not doing it
[19:39:10] <delinquentme_> http://jsfiddle.net/hW5En/1/  << right? so the console.log each gives me the names I want
[19:39:18] <delinquentme_> but the return statement is plain undefined
[19:40:21] <delinquentme_> wait I think you're right
[19:40:48] <jrajav> You changed it. The return is inside the .each iteration now
[19:40:50] <jrajav> That's wrong.
[19:41:21] <delinquentme_> http://jsfiddle.net/hW5En/2/
[19:41:23] <delinquentme_> this works
[19:41:28] <delinquentme_> i have no idea what was different
[19:41:30] <jrajav> Congratulations.
[19:41:34] <delinquentme_> ( using the collection operation )
[19:41:36] <delinquentme_> wt
[19:41:54] <jrajav> The difference is that the collection operation works on any particular collection - any object or array
[19:42:00] <jrajav> So it will not do special jQuery things
[19:42:11] <jrajav> In particular, set 'this' to be the current jQuery object being iterated over
[19:42:57] <delinquentme_> or I mean it works using the original $.each( obj, function() {})
[19:43:57] <delinquentme_> right? so this works: http://jsfiddle.net/hW5En/3/
[19:44:00] <delinquentme_> I have no idea
[19:45:12] <delinquentme_> ahhh! ok it was using .push versus <<
[19:45:17] <delinquentme_> what diff?
[19:46:34] <jrajav> The difference is that << is only a number operation in Javascript.
[19:46:38] <jrajav> It doesn't work on arrays
[19:47:23] <delinquentme_> jrajav, ah! noted.
[19:47:26] <delinquentme_> thanks!
[20:23:29] <aaas> i keep seeing the syntax 'var x = x || {}'  I'm not sure if this is drupal specific, but if not, can someone help me understand this statement?
[20:24:32] <tw2113> i assume if X already exists, it just assigns it to the same variable name
[20:24:43] <aaas> for example http://goo.gl/8d7zS
[20:24:44] <tw2113> but if x doesn't already exist, it just creates a new empty object
[20:24:48] <aaas> ah
[20:25:00] <aaas> ok that makes sense thanks
[20:28:35] <jrajav> Note that "exists" in this context means truthy
[20:29:11] <jrajav> So null does not "exist," nor does undefined.... or 0, '', [], etc..
[20:30:21] <aaas> jrajav thanks
[20:30:24] <guzzlefry> Is there a way to get the index of the current JQuery object?
[20:30:41] <guzzlefry> from say a bunch of divs grabbed with $('div')?
[20:31:46] <relipse> how do i form.serializeObjectAssocArray(); serializeArray() doesnt do it
[20:33:25] <relipse> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1184624/convert-form-data-to-js-object-with-jquery
[20:34:43] <guzzlefry> ah, .each() seems to supply it to the callback :)
[20:35:06] <phonebook_> guzzlefry, if you are talking about index as a child you can use .index
[20:40:11] <guzzlefry> hrm
[20:40:43] <guzzlefry> $('.negative');  <--- will this be null if no element has the class negative?
[20:41:42] <phonebook_> no. but check if it doesnt exist using $(".negative").length === 0
[20:42:23] <guzzlefry> ah, thank you :)
[20:45:08] <b1lly> is there a way to select a jquery object + child selector?
[20:45:26] <b1lly> aka $(this + '.myClass')
[20:46:13] <phonebook_> $(selector1 + "," + selector1 + " childSelector");
[20:46:34] <fschuindt> Guys, I am using .hover in some elements to show a info box, but that elements list has a endless scroll (which has an afterLoad callback) and new elements are created when user scrolls down, so the .hover does not work for these elements... Any tip to solve this without using .live?
[20:46:52] <b1lly> phonebook_: is that mean selector1 is a jquery objhect?
[20:47:49] <phonebook_> fschuint, $(document).on("hover", myFunc) ; // should bind forever
[20:48:25] <phonebook_> b1lly, selector1 would be a string you use to select what you want. like var selector1 = "#myDiv";
[20:49:01] <b1lly>  mean like
[20:49:01] <fschuindt> phonebook_: hum, thank will, I will try it
[20:49:09] <fschuindt> phonebook_: thank you*
[20:49:13] <b1lly> var blah = $('#blah');
[20:49:19] <b1lly> $(blah + ' .child')
[20:49:25] <phonebook_> np
[20:51:10] <phonebook_> b1lly, you can select more than one thing by adding a comma. so you would just provide multiple selectors. there are a lot of ways to select the element you want. there is a list of all selectors here http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ref_selectors.asp
[20:51:32] <b1lly> phonebook_: I'm not trying to select multiple
[20:51:48] <b1lly> I'm trying to chain a "jqueryObject" selector with a css selector
[20:52:00] <phonebook_> so just do var myElements = $("#myDiv1, #myDiv2")
[20:52:17] <b1lly> JQUERY OBJECT with a CSS
[20:53:24] <trinadh> b1lly: try add()
[20:53:46] <trinadh> ?.add @b1lly
[20:53:48] <bot-t> b1lly, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[20:53:53] <phonebook_> try selecting the child element that you want with a css selector. var myChild = $("#myParent .myChild"); // will select the child. so you do $("#myParent, #myParent .myChild"); and it will select them both
[20:54:43] <b1lly> phonebook_: I appreciate the help but your on the wrong track
[20:54:49] <b1lly> trinadh: let me take a look at that
[20:57:52] <aaas> im new at jquery can someone help me understand this or what keywords to use to search the jquery api? http://pastebin.com/6B2Q84RW    I see it as an object with three properties (?)--charts, attach, and detach--is this right?  actually I have a few more questions:  what does '[]' mean in this context
[20:57:53] <fschuindt> phonebook_: Well, was using .hover because it accepts two functions (mouse on and mouse off triggers, because I need it), so using .on I am using mouseenter and mouseleave, but it don't works for me, can you check my code? https://gist.github.com/4696155
[20:58:49] <fschuindt> phonebook_: Its don't works for the new elements
[21:05:32] <phonebook_> fschuindt, are they selectable by the same selector?
[21:09:05] <fschuindt> phonebook_: sorry, I don't understand what you mean
[21:09:23] <tw2113> fschuindt, a jsfiddle would be better than a gist
[21:09:40] <tw2113> ?dmeo
[21:09:43] <tw2113> ?demo

[21:10:05] <tw2113> close enough
[21:11:00] <phonebook_> fschuindt, see a working example of the concept here http://jsfiddle.net/uL2yn/
[21:14:27] <binaryfus10nz> if you have a sec, take a quick look at this simple hover function, I'm curious how I could write these few lines of code better. http://collabedit.com/pt6y2
[21:14:50] <binaryfus10nz> just looks like I'm doing too much?
[21:16:31] <fschuindt> phonebook_: Thank you, I realized what was wrong looking your example, it works now :)
[21:17:04] <phonebook_> cool
[21:17:18] <relipse> $.ajax should keep ajax sessions right?
[21:19:16] <b1lly> trinadh: .add doesn't do what I want it to
[21:19:39] <phonebook_> binaryfus10nz, imo that function looks fine. one thing that might work as an alternative is just having the image in the li and toggline .css({display:"none"}) and .css(display:""})
[21:20:02] <phonebook_> *toggling
[21:20:05] <binaryfus10nz> hmm
[21:20:12] <binaryfus10nz> and have 2 images?
[21:20:15] <binaryfus10nz> img tags
[21:21:13] <phonebook_> yeah it would work fine. i guess it depends on exactly what you are trying to do though
[21:22:55] <xboi209> how would I use the .eq function inside .load?
[21:24:13] <wroathe> xboi209: Post code
[21:25:30] <xboi209> $("#id").load("something.html div.class")   <--how would i get the second div.class without :eq()?
[21:27:48] <wroathe> $('#id').load('something.html div.class:eq(1)'); should work
[21:28:03] <xboi209> i said without :eq() ._.
[21:29:25] <binaryfus10nz> phonebook_, ill show you the URL if thats cool
[21:29:47] <phonebook_> sure
[21:30:00] <binaryfus10nz> http://ogkey.com/s2
[21:31:10] <phonebook_> oy. its gimmicky
[21:31:18] <binaryfus10nz> glitchy?
[21:31:48] <phonebook_> i dont like the animations
[21:32:03] <binaryfus10nz> ya thats a diff issue
[21:32:09] <binaryfus10nz> I have him remaking
[21:32:24] <binaryfus10nz> but if u go to http://ogkey.com/shower-doors they are better
[21:32:30] <xboi209> binary, you should optimize your site by combining those .js and .css files
[21:32:44] <binaryfus10nz> xboi209, maybe in production id consider it lol
[21:33:32] <xboi209> well don't forget to use the jquery hosted on google's cdn
[21:33:35] <phonebook_> the layout looks good.
[21:33:35] <binaryfus10nz> I changed it up phonebook_ u can refresh
[21:33:51] <binaryfus10nz> not using hover any more. mouseenter with a settimeout
[21:33:52] <binaryfus10nz> thx
[21:34:03] <phonebook_> yep thats pretty good
[21:34:34] <phonebook_> you could do a user-select:none; on some of the text
[21:34:53] <binaryfus10nz> didnt know u can do that
[21:34:56] <binaryfus10nz> thats JS or css
[21:36:07] <binaryfus10nz> http://collabedit.com/pt6y2
[21:36:14] <binaryfus10nz> is the find'img' bad on performance?
[21:36:28] <phonebook_> css. there are vendor prefixes so youd have to do........user-select:none; -webkit-user-select:none, -moz-user-select:none; -moz-user-select:none; o-user-select:none;
[21:37:58] <binaryfus10nz> good to know will check it out thxc\

[21:54:12] <the_dark_knight> Hi, Part my view is - http://www.bpaste.net/show/zdkueVXvKzPhBD8qb6dF/ . The $isMasterAccount variable is set in controller and it is set to 0 right now. So the <div> childrenDiv won't be loaded into my view. Now, I want to show this div using jquery's ediMaster() method. How do I do that? the value of $isMasterAccount is set based on a field-isMaster from one of my db's table. In editMaster() method, I will also be updating this isMaster field.
[21:58:22] <yankov> do you guys know any good plugin to build a nifty leaderboard widget?
[22:04:29] <the_dark_knight> Why is nobody answering on Sat and Sunday?

[22:07:45] <tw2113> my feet are cold
[22:07:54] <tw2113> oh shit, they're covered in ice too!
[22:21:09] <the_dark_knight> yankov: tw2113 , Am I chatting with people from my country only?
[22:21:47] <yankov> the_dark_knight:  what is your country?
[22:22:02] <tw2113> it's nearly 12:30am for me
[22:22:15] <yankov> 10:22pm
[22:23:09] <tw2113> pacific
[22:23:14] <tw2113> <--central
[22:23:27] <tw2113> so yankov and i just have no social lives
[22:23:54] <the_dark_knight> 11:55AM
[22:23:56] <yankov> more time to code tho
[22:24:59] <the_dark_knight> hi, yankov , tw2113 . Can you answer my jqery question. I am stuck here can't figure out what to do.
[22:25:25] * tw2113 has no mvc experience
[22:26:04] <yankov> sure ask, I'm more of a backend guy though, little jq experience,
[22:26:55] <the_dark_knight> Part of my view is - http://www.bpaste.net/show/zdkueVXvKzPhBD8qb6dF/ . The $isMasterAccount variable is set in controller and it is set to 0 right now.

[23:26:31] <DavidSullivan> anyone have IE to run a jsperf for me?
[23:26:32] <DavidSullivan> http://jsperf.com/label-selector-test
[23:28:24] <sCoRpi> Testing in IE 9.0 32-bit on Windows Server 2008 R2 / 7 64-bit
[23:29:06] <sCoRpi> [for='id']: 46,261 ±1.99%7% slower
[23:29:22] <sCoRpi> label[for='id']: 45,551 ±1.01%7% slower
[23:29:50] <sCoRpi> find(label).filter('for="id"]'): 50,783 ±1.63%fastest
[23:30:12] <DavidSullivan> so realy not that much difference
[23:30:23] <sCoRpi> but that's ie9
[23:30:47] <DavidSullivan> yeah but not much difference between the 3 different tests
[23:31:02] <sCoRpi> no
[23:31:29] <DavidSullivan> Testing in Chrome 24.0.1312.56 on Linux 64-bit
[23:31:41] <sCoRpi> check the ie8 results
[23:31:51] <DavidSullivan> [for='id']  74,719   ±4.21% 12%
[23:32:04] <DavidSullivan> oh fuck thats slow
[23:32:35] <sCoRpi> it's not real ie8, since it's the built in version in ie9
[23:32:41] <sCoRpi> but it gives a good direction i think
[23:32:46] <DavidSullivan> oh compatability mode
[23:32:47] <sCoRpi> funny thing: the ie7 version is faster than ie8
[23:32:53] <sCoRpi> yeah, no real ie8 anymore
[23:33:41] <_zoggy_> use a vm
[23:34:06] <sCoRpi> DavidSullivan: i just added some firefox tests
[23:34:14] <DavidSullivan> _zoggy_, that would be fine if I had a license for anything that would run ie
[23:34:19] <_zoggy_> http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/08/07/a-dozen-cross-browser-testing-tools/
[23:35:04] <_zoggy_> i just use virtualbox and have a winxp image with all my legacy browsers
[23:36:18] <DavidSullivan> the thing is if I increase the number of <input>s and thier associated <label>s  the test results get closer together
[23:38:31] <DavidSullivan> can't believe that .find('label').filter('[for="rb-250-2"]')   is slower on most IE and FF
[23:39:05] <DavidSullivan> anyone happen to have IE 10
[23:39:30] <DavidSullivan> happy to see that Chrome is blowing them outa the water though
[23:43:00] <greg5green> DavidSullivan, you still need any tests?
[23:43:06] <greg5green> i can boot ie6/7/8 in vm
[23:43:43] <DavidSullivan> greg5green, don't realy care about ie6,  but if anyone has safari that would be cool
[23:44:05] <greg5green> running that now
[23:44:07] <DavidSullivan> look at the opera results
[23:46:24] <DavidSullivan> well it don't look like I am going to commit this bug tonight
[23:46:33] <greg5green> raun it on safari a few times
[23:46:58] <greg5green> ran*
[23:47:16] <DavidSullivan> realy thought .find('label').filter('[name="whatever"]') would have been the fastest on all
