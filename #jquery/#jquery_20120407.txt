[00:00:22] <raj> var x = $('select.someselect').val(); $('select.someotherselect').find('option[value=x]').remove()
[00:00:31] <raj> or something along those lines I think
[00:02:38] <Morteza_ipo> thank you so much
[00:05:06] <raj> where r the big dogs tonight?
[00:31:33] <Noeble> question: I have a jquery plugin that helps me zoom in an image to fit the parrent container to keep the images proportions. Now.. the problem is that I append some images in jquery.. and these images dont get affected my the zom script.. how can I solve that? Must I change the image properties before append?
[00:41:59] <gnarf> Noeble: more likely you need to run the plugin on them as you append them
[01:06:50] <osirisx11-zzz> what is the best way to find the closest element to the mouse?
[01:27:07] <SkyKnight> Jquery serialize() throws empty string from a form, here is the source of the form http://paste.debian.net/162402 and the javascript http://paste.debian.net/162404/ used to show the serialized output. can some one point me where I am doing mistake?
[01:38:58] <rasputin1> Can someone help me out - I'm trying to get a simple radio button set to get themed up in JQueryUI, I've followed all instructions, and while all other things I've tried such as datepicker and slider work, radiobuttons do not:
[01:39:43] <rasputin1> I've included the jqui css, the jq js, and the jq ui js
[01:39:51] <rasputin1> I have this in the page:
[01:39:59] <rasputin1> $(function(){$("duration").buttonset();});
[01:40:24] <rasputin1> and finally, I have a block which it should work on:
[01:40:57] <rasputin1> sorry that should have been:
[01:40:59] <rasputin1> $(function(){$("jqui-radio").buttonset();});
[01:41:09] <rasputin1> <div id="duration" class="jqui-radio">
[01:41:16] <rasputin1> <label for="t0">~15m</label>   <input id="t0" type="radio" name="radio" />
[01:41:19] <rasputin1> ...
[01:41:26] <rasputin1> </div>
[01:41:29] <ravenzz> there is a missing dot
[01:41:31] <ravenzz> in the selector
[01:41:37] <ravenzz> $(".jqui-radio")
[01:42:35] <fluffypony> hi all - I'm trying to use jQuery to replace the "9 more needed to complete shipment" in this piece of html: http://pastebin.com/NAh3ZG8v - and I'm feeling like a complete noob. The wlt-ProductStatus is unique in the DOM, so that would, I imagine, be the point of entry for finding it?
[01:43:48] <ravenzz> fluffypony you want to replace that text?
[01:44:11] <nlogax> fluffypony: it's probably easier to stick in inside an element of its own, but otherwise you have this to get into the text nodes http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[01:44:28] <rasputin2> bad internet connection sorry ravenzz
[01:44:46] <fluffypony> ravenzz: more specifically I want to delete it - I can't wrap it in an element of its own without changing core files (which is precisely what I'm hoping I can avoid)
[01:46:09] <ravenzz> fluffypony is it dynamic?
[01:46:17] <ravenzz> I mean 9 could be 69 or something
[01:46:18] <ravenzz> right?
[01:46:19] <fluffypony> the number will change
[01:46:22] <fluffypony> but the rest won't
[01:46:37] <fluffypony> which means I'm probably going to be knee deep in regex (which I suck at)
[01:47:09] <ravenzz> yep
[01:47:18] <ravenzz> that's quite easy
[01:48:19] <ravenzz> you can select on $('#wlt-ProductStatus:contains("more needed to complete shipment")')
[01:48:49] <ravenzz> or select any $('#wlt-ProductStatus')
[01:48:51] <ravenzz> and replace
[01:49:28] <fluffypony> ok - but then I'll be replacing just the text, or will I have to use regex to include the number?
[01:49:31] <ravenzz> the regex is pretty easy /\d+ more needed to complete shipment/is
[01:49:49] <ravenzz> \d are numbers
[01:50:06] <ravenzz> + means that there should be at least one number
[01:50:11] <ravenzz> one or more of course
[01:50:15] <fluffypony> oookay
[01:50:27] <fluffypony> let me play on jsfiddle and see if I can get it right :)
[01:51:00] <rasputin1> so any ideas why my radio buttons look completely un-styled?  is there anything i have to do other than include the jqui css?
[01:51:21] <rasputin1> i have all the images mentioned in there too, and i know they're at the correct uri
[01:51:31] <ravenzz> rasputin1 there is a missing dot in the selector actually $(".jqui-radio")
[01:51:51] <rasputin1> yes - that was a type by me - i checked and it's fine in the source
[01:51:56] <rasputin1> as in it has the dot
[01:52:13] <rasputin1> and as i mentioned, the JS is working correctly (i may have been cut off sorry)
[01:53:32] <ravenzz> can you reproduce it on jsfiddle?
[01:53:47] <ParanoidGal> Do any of you get fading of images when scrolling through this slider on Firefox http://www.eliasentertainment.net? Client says they do but I can't recreate the issue
[01:54:55] <ParanoidGal> I should add they are using a Mac
[01:58:18] <nlogax> fluffypony: apologies for formating, dunno why jsfiddle hates me so much http://jsfiddle.net/DbUwz/
[01:58:52] <fluffypony> nlogax: you're a genius - thanks :)
[02:03:03] <rasputin1> sorry guys i have water in the conduits and a really crappy line until strata fixes it
[02:04:00] <f0rkn1ght> Follow Me @StevenPeterson_ for latest code snippets :)
[02:05:04] <nlogax> will they make me rich and famous?
[02:05:55] <f0rkn1ght> nlogax,  if you smoke the 30$ coke blunts like the rest of us
[02:06:01] <f0rkn1ght> lmao
[02:06:03] <nlogax> :D
[02:18:39] <cheesypoof20> Hi, I am trying to use the value of a <select> on change in a .load url. I'm not sure exactly the format is to do this. http://jsfiddle.net/8ZbUR/
[02:19:44] <nlogax> cheesypoof20: `this.value` shoudl be its value, iirc
[02:21:56] <cheesypoof20> I typed that in, and the load url didn't have the value in it. This is literally my second attempt at jquery.
[02:23:06] <Noeble> gnarf: still around?
[02:23:54] <cheesypoof20> I'm making chained selects. My first select tag determines what gets loaded into the second select based on the first's value.
[02:24:23] <nlogax> cheesypoof20: http://jsfiddle.net/8ZbUR/1/ seems to work, exept it's 404ing on jsfiddle
[02:24:48] <nlogax> but it is requesting the expected url
[02:28:23] <cheesypoof20> :P I literally typed in `this.value`
[02:28:51] <cheesypoof20> Ok, I understand now how it should be formatted. Like so: "first" + "second"
[02:28:59] <cheesypoof20> thank you
[02:29:49] <Noeble> question: I have a jquery plugin that helps me zoom in an image to fit the parrent container to keep the images proportions. Now.. the problem is that I append some images in jquery.. and these images dont get affected my the zom script.. how can I solve that? Must I change the image properties before append?
[02:30:55] <Noeble> code: http://dpaste.com/728106/   ,  line 19-21 is the other plugin that I use on images in my html files.. this of course does not work.. can anyone give me a hint how to use that plugin in my actual jquery code before I append the image?
[02:50:34] <jrockjiggz> I have an upload script in a lightbox.. if the user closes the lightbox those files remain on the server... not sure how to tackle that problem
[02:53:05] <cheesypoof20> Once the files are uploaded and the lightbox closes, what would you like to happen?
[02:54:40] <jrockjiggz> i'm concerned about the server upload directory filling up with unused photos
[02:55:09] <jrockjiggz> my only idea is to setup a cronjob that gathers every image saved in the db, and delete any file that isn't in the list
[02:55:18] <jrockjiggz> but that doesn't scale well
[02:56:02] <jrockjiggz> its a lot of space because per photo is duplicated 5 times with various sizes
[02:57:06] <spat> what is the difference between $(':input[name="something"]') and $('input[name="something"]')
[02:57:48] <nlogax> spat: ':input' is a custom selector that matches all kinds of form elements, 'input' is the standard input selector
[02:58:46] <spat> nlogax: ok thank you
[02:59:16] <dawa> Hi guys, is there any way to create an agenda with jquery mobile?
[02:59:39] <cheesypoof20> jrockjiggz: If you are going through a process to select images that should be put in your database, why can't you at the same time delete those that are not selected for the database. Approve/Deny concept?
[03:01:45] <jrockjiggz> cheesypoof20: the php script will save the file, and return the filename through ajax.  jquery will display the photo in the form.. the filename is submitted with the form that gets saved into the db
[03:02:04] <jrockjiggz> so theres no real process of selecting photos
[03:03:12] <jrockjiggz> i couldn't delete all photos in dir that are not part of the submit because each user have 1 img directory that holds all their photos
[03:05:10] <nlogax> surely there is some point at which the user has decided to save the photo, explicitly or implicitly?
[03:05:36] <jrockjiggz> yes, after they are uploaded.. but by then their upload is already in the bag of all their files
[03:05:58] <jrockjiggz> but if they close the lightbox, theres no way of telling if they cancelled the form or sessioned out or what not
[03:06:16] <nlogax> so you could keep them somewhere else until "done", then commit everything
[03:06:50] <jrockjiggz> thats a great idea
[03:07:11] <jrockjiggz> ok
[03:07:14] <jrockjiggz> makes sense
[03:07:33] <cheesypoof20> nlogax: Could you help me understand why I am receiving an 'undefined' value for the 'Model' select. http://jsfiddle.net/8ZbUR/3/
[03:07:53] <nlogax> then you can also keep it around "forever", if they leave and come back (like an upload in progress), and only have one little pile of possible garbage per user
[03:08:46] <jrockjiggz> cheesypoof20: i think you need $(this) instead of this ?
[03:09:03] <nlogax> cheesypoof20:  $("make").val() should be "#make" perhaps?
[03:09:22] <cheesypoof20> epic fail
[03:09:26] <jrockjiggz> ;p
[03:10:06] <cheesypoof20> thx :P
[03:10:12] <nlogax> :)
[03:50:09] <ParanoidGal> Got an image clipping issue that's only appearing on Firefox Mac OS, can't put my finger on what it's connected to http://www.eliasentertainment.net (right hand images only)
[04:15:48] <silv3r_m00n> when making an ajax request , is it possible to get all the headers that are being send in that request ?
[04:20:06] <dabear> silv3r_m00n: request or response headers?
[04:20:46] <dabear> var jqxhr = $.ajax(...); jqxhr.getResponseHeader() should work at least
[04:21:39] <ussher_> ParanoidGal: looks like padding on the image to me.  maybe try setting it to 0?
[04:22:36] <silv3r_m00n> dabear: request
[04:22:47] <silv3r_m00n> the headers , that are "about" to be sent
[04:22:53] <silv3r_m00n> by browser
[04:24:31] <dabear> I know you can override any header, not sure about fetching all request headers though
[04:25:01] <dabear> $.ajax(url, { beforeSend: function(xhr){xhr.setRequestHeader('X-Test-Header', 'test-value');} })
[04:25:03] <dabear> etc
[04:28:47] <ParanoidGal> Thanks ussher_ will give it go!
[04:31:37] <silv3r_m00n> dabear: hmm
[04:31:40] <dabear> silv3r_m00n: why do you need this?
[04:31:59] <dabear> It seems it cannot be done, unless you alter the jquery source
[04:32:03] <dabear> if you search for
[04:32:04] <dabear> / Caches the header
[04:32:09] <dabear>  // Caches the header
[04:32:24] <dabear> then there is a function setRequestHeader:
[04:33:25] <silv3r_m00n> ok
[04:33:28] <dabear> you can add another function called getAllRequestHeaders: function(){  return requestHeaders;} (must be done directly in the source)
[04:33:42] <cambazz> hello, I would like to make an internationalized adress form. what is the best way of doing this right now? also where do we get the list of countries, cities, and maybe adress formats?
[04:34:00] <dabear> and then $.ajax(url, { beforeSend: function(xhr){xhr.getAllRequestHeaders() } })
[04:34:15] <dabear> if you reaaally have to, that should work
[04:34:33] <dabear> but note that there is almost always a better way..
[04:36:12] <silv3r_m00n> dabear: thanks
[04:37:05] <dabear> silv3r_m00n: what do you need this for?
[04:37:31] <silv3r_m00n> thinking if this can be used to launch easy phishing hack attacks
[04:38:10] <silv3r_m00n> fetch the headers that are about to be send to some external domain , and then save them in a variable and post them to hackers domain
[04:39:14] <silv3r_m00n> dabear: do you think its possible ?
[04:39:23] <silv3r_m00n> basically to steal cookie data
[04:39:33] <lost123> every thing is possible
[04:39:55] <silv3r_m00n> that's good
[04:40:24] <dabear> I am not helping with stealing
[04:40:31] <lost123> lol
[04:40:55] <silv3r_m00n> dabear: no probs , I am stealing anything , just researching that point
[04:41:16] <silv3r_m00n> I am not*
[04:42:16] <lost123> i need a ul to slide like it does in a slideshow..i am using 	$('#navi > ul ').toggle('slide') but that doesn't give me the effect i like
[04:42:23] <lost123> can someone suggest anything?
[04:44:50] <dabear> lost123: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/
[04:44:55] <jrockjiggz> nlogax: your upload idea works great, thanks for the idea
[04:50:04] <nlogax> jrockjiggz: cool :)
[05:06:46] <Kre10s> I'm trying to build a simple image cropper. I have the image shown, but I am having trouble capturing the mouse move event. the only way I can get it to fire is when I hook $(window).mousemove why can't i hook $editor.mousemove ?

[05:33:07] <Defusal> hi everyone
[05:34:56] <Defusal> i must be doing something really stupid, since i cannot figure out why this does not work...
[05:35:09] <Defusal> $('.ui-dialog').filter(function() { console.debug('"'+$('.ui-dialog-title', this).text()+'" '+($('.ui-dialog-title', this).text() == 'Plugin Manager')); $('.ui-dialog-title', this).text() == 'Plugin Manager' })
[05:35:09] <Defusal> "Plugin Manager" true
[05:35:10] <Defusal> []
[05:36:05] <Defusal> from the console ouput, the condition and value is right, yet it returns no elements...
[05:55:37] <Defusal> bleh, nevermind, i was missing an explicit return, too used to using coffeescript
[05:58:53] <evilgeenius> Is there an easy way to loop through all the elements that have a specific class, but loop through them so that the most deeply nested elements appear first?
[06:01:43] <dabear> evilgeenius: yep. get the elements, then use var $elems = $("..."); $elems = $elems.sort( function(a,b){  return ...}  )
[06:01:59] <dabear> evilgeenius: in other words, you gotta implement a sorting mecanism
[06:02:12] <dabear> the sort is not documented in the jquery docs, but see this:
[06:02:19] <dabear> ?mdc array sort
[06:02:20] <bot-t> dabear, Array sort - Mozilla Developer Network - Sorts the elements of an array in place. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[06:04:37] <evilgeenius> dabear: thanks.  Is there a function that will give me the deepness of an element?
[06:06:19] <_ikke_> evilgeenius: I guess you need to create it yourself
[06:06:48] <_ikke_> evilgeenius: traverse parents ontil you reach document for example
[06:06:56] <_ikke_> s/ontil/until
[06:07:01] <dabear> evilgeenius: you can count the parents of an element
[06:07:10] <evilgeenius> thanks
[06:07:27] <dabear> evilgeenius: also note that doing so is gonna cost a lot
[06:07:38] <dabear> i.e. it will be slow if done on the client side
[06:07:54] <dabear> at least for many elements
[06:15:13] <Logikos> suposeing i had several div boxes all position:absolute;left:0;top:0; contained within a div id="someid" ... the child div's are obviously stacked on ontop of another, now if i set boxes = $("#someid").children()  and with a timer was counting through the boxes to preform an animate on opacity, but i wanted 2 childern to togel opacity at the same time
[06:15:16] <Logikos> how would i do that?
[06:15:31] <Logikos> to make only say the 2nd and 3rd child togle it at the same time?
[06:16:01] <Logikos> can i do like $(boxes[1],boxes[2]).animate(...

[08:00:10] <nights> hi
[08:00:55] <nights> how can i use "on" on my #login_button click function?
[08:01:35] <shoky> $('#login_button').on('click', ...)  ?
[08:01:44] <nights> hmm
[08:01:46] <tman-> nm clearing the cache appears to have fixed it.
[08:02:30] <nights> shoky: ok! so where should my action go in that?
[08:02:59] <shoky> nights, you want to use "on" without knowing how to use it?
[08:02:59] <nights> $('#login_button').on('click', function(e){}); ?
[08:03:08] <shoky> yes
[08:03:13] <nights> im unsure about the syntax thats all
[08:03:18] <shoky> that's what the docs are for
[08:03:20] <nights> couldnt find any good resources
[08:03:22] <nights> :(
[08:03:28] <nights> most are for older stuff like delegate
[08:03:33] <shoky> ?on @ nights
[08:03:33] <bot-t> nights, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:03:53] <shoky> you might also just want to see ?click
[08:03:53] <bot-t> .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[08:05:37] <zatan_> hi can anyone tell me whi alert isnt showing on submit ? http://jsfiddle.net/rPU79/
[08:07:10] <shoky> zatan_ it does, if you actually link to jquery
[08:07:24] <shoky> like so http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/rPU79/2/
[08:07:55] <zatan_> shoky, sorry my bad:))
[08:10:58] <shoky> evilgeenius, sure there's an easy way
[08:11:29] <dabear> evilgeenius: nice

[08:53:42] <Munger> I'm want to provide an infinite horizontal scrolling view loading data via ajax, but don't want to overload the DOM with potentially thousands of elements. Is there a recommended approach to this?
[09:07:13] <shoky> no idea about mobile.. but.. how about not loading thousands of elements?
[09:09:59] <pif> hi, how do I focus a textarea with the cursor on the last line?
[09:10:57] <Munger> Right. I pnly want to have a few elements either side of the visible postion loaded. Just wondered if there was already a plugin that handled this sort of thing
[09:11:04] <tman-> responsive design rocks my box.
[09:13:50] <nights> i have a problem that after i load some ajax content to my page, some of the original jquery calls gets invalidated (basically get a $("#myModal").modal is not a function ) ... how can i debug this?
[09:14:04] <nights> its so painful :( been on this issue forages
[09:19:14] <g0th> hi
[09:20:18] <g0th> I have html elements with an index which are continiously added to a container, I would like to automatically "sort" them, resp. view them one after another like a list, sorted by the index...
[09:20:27] <g0th> what's the best way to do this?
[09:21:09] <hossein> salam
[09:21:11] <hossein> asaasa
[09:21:14] <hossein> as
[09:21:27] <g0th> my current idea is to "sort the elements using jquery's sort function (I guess from the array prototype)
[09:21:41] <g0th> but I don't get what it does
[09:22:10] <g0th> do I call $(parent).sort(sortfunction) ?
[09:22:41] <g0th> or $(all that I want to sort).sort(..)?
[09:22:47] <g0th> the second seems to make no sense
[09:22:49] <shoky> jquery doesn't have a sort function
[09:22:55] <g0th> well it has
[09:23:08] <g0th> but maybe it is not supposed to be used
[09:23:13] <g0th> so what should I do instead?
[09:23:25] <SoulRaven> anyone use datatables?
[09:23:29] <shoky> arrays have a sort function
[09:23:37] <g0th> and jquery inherit from array
[09:23:52] <SoulRaven> i can't capture a click on a button, when the table is populated using json
[09:24:02] <shoky> g0th, http://www.onemoretake.com/2009/02/25/sorting-elements-with-jquery/
[09:24:43] <g0th> shoky: that's not what I want
[09:24:50] <g0th> it creates a new html element each time
[09:25:07] <g0th> but I access my elements using arrays/etc
[09:25:26] <shoky> i didn't say copy it exactly as it is..
[09:25:27] <g0th> so when I create a new one I would need to modify several arrays and first find out the respective index/etc
[09:25:30] <g0th> seems ugly
[09:25:37] <g0th> hmm
[09:26:50] <g0th> what does .get() do?
[09:27:47] <g0th> (it is the "core" function of the above script)
[09:28:17] <shoky> ?get
[09:28:18] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[09:30:24] <g0th> strange, when I looked for get it showed me another funciton
[09:30:26] <g0th> thanks
[09:31:39] <shoky> well there's also $.get , for ajax shit
[09:32:15] <g0th> hmm
[09:32:22] <g0th> does it remove the element from the dom?
[09:33:25] <shoky> .get() ?
[09:33:26] <shoky> no
[09:34:32] <g0th> so your suggestion is: get all childrens from the parent using get, sort them using my own comparison function, remove the elements from the dom and insert them again from the result we calculated before?
[09:34:47] <g0th> sounds silly
[09:34:55] <g0th> is there no better way?
[09:35:02] <g0th> dom insertion/removal is rather slow
[09:35:22] <g0th> in fact it is one of the bigger bottlenecks in my program
[09:35:23] <shoky> sure there is, you could just insert each new element into its designated place
[09:35:30] <g0th> how?
[09:35:49] <shoky> uh, by its index.. whatever you're using for sorting
[09:35:50] <nights> hi
[09:35:52] <shoky> hi
[09:35:55] <g0th> but how?
[09:36:05] <g0th> the index changes btw
[09:36:17] <nights> after i load some jquery content by ajax my original jquery code starts to fail. what can i do to debug??
[09:36:19] <nights> :(
[09:36:25] <shoky> g0th
[09:36:29] <shoky> if you want to sort elements
[09:36:31] <nights> struggled with this for so long now.
[09:36:32] <shoky> DOM elements
[09:36:42] <nights> if anyone could have a look please.
[09:36:43] <shoky> then you need DOM removal and insertion anyway...
[09:36:43] <nights> :(
[09:37:02] <g0th> shoky: hmm, ok
[09:37:07] <g0th> :(
[09:37:37] <g0th> how would you model a webpage that has entries (with a "changing" index) such that they are shown like a sorted list?
[09:38:01] <g0th> similar to sortables
[09:38:43] <shoky> nights, have a look where?
[09:39:18] <shoky> g0th i donno, i'd sit and think about it :)
[09:39:19] <g0th> I recreate the whole dom content each time anything changes where "anything" e.g. means that an element is added
[09:39:41] <g0th> is that the idea?
[09:39:59] <g0th> by whole dom content I mean all below the specific parent ofc
[09:40:10] <shoky> like i said, you could instead just move the 'new' or 'changed' element to its destined slot
[09:40:22] <g0th> hmm but how do I do that?
[09:40:24] <SoulRaven> if i am using .on(), how i atach the click event on multiple buttons on the same time
[09:40:29] <g0th> insert an html element at a "slot"
[09:40:31] <g0th> slot=?
[09:40:34] <suashi> hello
[09:40:45] <shoky> g0th, you can insert after a specific element with .after()
[09:40:52] <shoky> and there's .before()
[09:40:52] <g0th> hmm
[09:40:52] <SoulRaven> i am using on() because the buttons are added using json
[09:40:57] <shoky> and other insertion stuff
[09:41:02] <g0th> ok
[09:41:10] <g0th> that might be the better approach, thx
[09:41:25] <shoky> np
[09:41:41] <g0th> but my guess is that finding the slot is as bad as just reacreating everything
[09:41:53] <shoky> SoulRaven, you use a selector as the second argument to .on()
[09:42:00] <nights> shoky: i sent you the link please.
[09:42:18] <SoulRaven> shoky: yes, i know, but is not working
[09:42:23] <g0th> hmm, but the calculation would not add any dom content except the one last insertion...
[09:42:33] <g0th> so it might still be faster
[09:42:34] <shoky> SoulRaven: like  $('#myContainer').on('click', '.myButtonClass', function... )
[09:42:46] <nights> if you press the login button on the upper right before the ajax page loads you can see the login modal, but after the ajax finishes loading the modal isnt found any longer :(
[09:42:51] <SoulRaven> shoky: yes, $(oTable).on('click', editButton, function (e)
[09:42:59] <shoky> SoulRaven see ?demo
[09:42:59] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:43:02] <nights> shoky: if you press the login button on the upper right before the ajax page loads you can see the login modal, but after the ajax finishes loading the modal isnt found any longer :(
[09:43:12] <SoulRaven> but is not working, even if the editButton is a array of buttons
[09:43:21] <shoky> it's not working @ SoulRaven
[09:43:25] <shoky> darn.
[09:43:43] <SoulRaven> i can't create a demo because i on a framework, with data parsed from json, and datatables jquery plugin
[09:43:55] <shoky> so?
[09:44:01] <shoky> ?jsfiddle
[09:44:01] <bot-t> jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[09:44:51] <shoky> g0th, finding the slot is much faster than recreating the dom...
[09:45:37] <SoulRaven> the problem is that the click event is not binded to the editButton array, is binded to the delegated element
[09:45:56] <shoky> yes that's how delegation works
[09:47:17] <shoky> nights i'm not sure what the problem is ?
[09:47:36] <g0th> shoky: each element has an index but it does not correspond to its position, so I would need to go through all elements and do mainArray.indexOf(el) and compare that result with the index of the to be added element
[09:48:04] <g0th> the main array has length up to maybe 5000
[09:48:12] <shoky> nights, wakaranai yo
[09:48:23] <nights> nande?
[09:48:29] <g0th> hmm I need to store additional information somewhere
[09:48:30] <nights> onegai kara---tetsudatte ne...
[09:48:49] <g0th> or _maybe_ it is still fast enough, even though my whole approach sounds so ridiculously wasteful
[09:49:00] <shoky> eigo ni hanashite kudasai ;)
[09:49:11] <nights> ok
[09:49:25] <nights> shoky: after the ajax content gets loaded, the original jquery call stops working (the #myModal object isnt found any more)
[09:49:39] <nights> the selector works
[09:49:48] <nights> as in if i put an alert in there it is shown
[09:49:51] <shoky> what ajax content?
[09:50:02] <nights> the menu and the cart is loaded by ajax
[09:50:15] <shoky> the dialog keeps showing fine
[09:50:17] <nights> after those are loaded, the #myModal div isnt found anymore
[09:50:20] <nights> what?
[09:50:22] <gnarf> g0th: do the indicies change?
[09:50:39] <shoky> i click rogin and i see the rogin diarogu
[09:50:44] <nights> really?
[09:50:45] <nights> shoky: which browser? ...
[09:50:47] <shoky> yeah
[09:50:48] <shoky> chrome
[09:50:57] <g0th> gnarf: yes
[09:51:28] <gnarf> g0th: is the raw "array" data needed to be an array?
[09:51:40] <g0th> what do you mean?
[09:51:40] <nights> shoky: hm... after everything is loaded+
[09:51:49] <shoky> nights, seems to be..
[09:51:57] <g0th> it is an array from an external module/class
[09:51:58] <shoky> still clicking on it now and it still appears
[09:52:06] <nights> shoky: so no waiting ajax queries?
[09:52:12] <gnarf> g0th: could you use an object with a hashed key?
[09:52:14] <shoky> how would i know
[09:52:19] <g0th> gnarf: basically I want to extend the array with html elements
[09:52:26] <shoky> page isn't showing signs of loading anything
[09:52:27] <nights> the net panel in the programmer section
[09:52:30] <nights> ok
[09:52:35] <g0th> but I cannot "pollute" the array since it is part of a completely different module
[09:52:43] <nights> its so strange. it doesnt work for me in either chrome, firefox or IE,  either on this computer or another
[09:52:49] <g0th> and I definitely don't want to "copy" all those complicated array modifications over
[09:53:03] <g0th> I could try this but then I basically copy the whole module ^^
[09:53:16] <gnarf> g0th: and you can't set a _element property on the objects stored?
[09:53:38] <g0th> from the original array?
[09:53:49] <g0th> not really, no
[09:53:54] <gnarf> yeah
[09:54:02] <g0th> hmm it would "pollute" the class
[09:54:20] <gnarf> but will that cause any problems?
[09:54:35] <g0th> for pragmatic reasons I might just do that though
[09:55:10] <g0th> gnarf: I have no ideas, it is rather complex, so it might be that the "element" will be lost
[09:55:15] <shoky> ah nights
[09:55:21] <g0th> thx shoky
[09:55:22] <g0th> gnight
[09:55:22] <nights> shoky: ah?
[09:55:26] <nights> :)
[09:55:28] <shoky> i didnt click on the map thing and didnt choose options
[09:55:32] <g0th> lol ^^
[09:55:36] <shoky> i just clicked away from it and cancelled it
[09:55:40] <shoky> so i didnt get the ajax loading
[09:55:42] <nights> shoky: i see! thats why then
[09:55:44] <nights> yes
[09:55:44] <g0th> gnarf: my guess is: it won't work
[09:55:51] <shoky> so i see the problem now too
[09:55:58] <nights> ok thats relieving
[09:56:01] <shoky> ;P
[09:56:04] <g0th> unless I modify the main class that it works but this requires a refactoring of everything
[09:56:15] <nights> but what could have caused it? i have spent the full day on trying to look into the code :(
[09:56:21] <nights> still completely clueless how to solve it
[09:56:21] <shoky> i'll take a look in a min
[09:56:28] <nights> thank you so much
[09:56:56] <gnarf> g0th: ill tell you right now .indexOf (or rather jQuery.inArray ) is an "expensive" operation to perform on a 5000 element array
[09:57:20] <g0th> gnarf: that's what I said too, but those js guys always tell me not to worry about performance
[09:57:40] <g0th> they have an extermely fixed mind about "ignoring performance" issues ^^
[09:57:50] <gnarf> well - do what you need to do until perf is an issue
[09:58:08] <g0th> so far all works
[09:58:21] <g0th> but since I am only testing I have not more than 60 elements
[09:58:27] <gnarf> cuz if it works, and you don't experience a ton of slowness when running it on your "supported browser" list, then you're prolly fine
[09:58:31] <g0th> so my guess is 5000 might make it slow ^^
[09:58:45] <DEADB33F> opera
[09:58:50] <DEADB33F> W/C
[09:58:59] <g0th> and the main issue is: I cannot just "performance" tweak it then
[09:59:08] <g0th> I will need to redesign the overall design from scratch again
[09:59:19] <g0th> which is why I ask myself these questions _now_
[09:59:40] <shoky> nights
[09:59:44] <shoky> first of all-
[09:59:45] <shoky> <nights> after those are loaded, the #myModal div isnt found anymore
[09:59:47] <shoky> that's not true
[09:59:54] <shoky> it's the .modal() function which is not found
[10:00:10] <shoky> something is screwing with the jquery plugin
[10:00:29] <nights> hmm
[10:00:45] <nights> what does it mean?
[10:00:55] <nights> ok
[10:01:06] <g0th> gnarf: hmm I think I can just give the right "index" each time a new element is added, then I know which position at I have to add the new element
[10:01:08] <nights> so what do you think happend inside that ajax request?
[10:01:16] <shoky> not sure
[10:01:19] <g0th> gnarf: how do I add an element at position, e.g. "7"?
[10:01:45] <g0th> resp. how do I get the 6'th element?
[10:01:57] <g0th> or 6'th child/whatever
[10:02:22] <oDesk> is there anyway to know if class name has an attached bind/live/click  actions ??
[10:03:04] <shoky> classes don't have events binded to them
[10:03:36] <oDesk> i mean  class="hello"   then  $(".hello").click(function(){});
[10:04:05] <oDesk> how i may know that class  hello has bind event which could be any event
[10:04:10] <shoky> classes don't have events binded to them
[10:04:29] <shoky> that binds the click event on all elements with the hello class
[10:04:33] <shoky> not on the hello class itself
[10:04:36] <oDesk> shoky: I'm sure i can bind events to class tags
[10:05:06] <shoky> $(".hello").click(function(){});  binds events to the elements, not to the class
[10:05:12] <gnarf> g0th: [7] ?
[10:05:22] <oDesk> shoky: i see, i just want to detect events attached to $(this)  whatever $(this) is
[10:05:23] <gnarf> ?mdc .splice
[10:05:25] <bot-t> gnarf, Array - MDN - Lets you work with arrays. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array
[10:05:38] <g0th> $(parent)[7]?
[10:05:40] <g0th> so simple?
[10:06:02] <oDesk> shoky: got it ?
[10:06:14] <g0th> gnarf: I mean for the html elements in the dom
[10:06:50] <gnarf> .children()[7] works too
[10:06:57] <g0th> ok, thanks
[10:07:02] <gnarf> or .eq() if you want it still wrapped in jQuery
[10:07:08] <shoky> oDesk actually i donno how ;) but i'm sure it's simple
[10:07:11] <gnarf> ?before
[10:07:12] <bot-t> .before(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, before each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/before/
[10:07:24] <gnarf> that will let you inject something before something else
[10:07:41] <nights> shoky: if i paid you something, could you solve this?
[10:07:49] <nights> i have given up :(
[10:10:35] <lmao25> http://pastie.org/3745613 <-- can't gget item_cost to display... am i doing it properly?
[10:12:30] <g0th> gnarf: I will have to kind of "copy" the main class to keep track of all rearrangements and each time pass on the involved indices (this makes it rather deeply dependant on any modifications to the main module and its "supposedly private stuff", but I think this is still the best way, thyx
[10:18:48] <shoky> nights
[10:19:00] <shoky> the ajax response is eval()'d
[10:19:20] <shoky> that code then sends another ajax request and puts the result in a div
[10:19:37] <shoky> this last result (  the html in: jQuery('#directoryListPanel').html(html);  )
[10:19:43] <shoky> has <script> stuff
[10:19:53] <shoky> such as:
[10:19:53] <shoky> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/e5962721/jquery.min.js"></script>
[10:19:54] <shoky> <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/e5962721/jquery.ba-bbq.js"></script>
[10:20:04] <shoky> loading more scripts blabla
[10:20:16] <shoky> this all seems like a recipe for disaster
[10:20:42] <shoky> oh
[10:20:52] <shoky> that html has all the ajax code inside it as well
[10:21:12] <shoky> you need to take care of your ajax stuff  and what it's returning :P
[10:22:31] <shoky> nights. this is what that ajax returns: https://gist.github.com/2330583
[10:22:47] <nights> hn
[10:22:48] <nights> hm
[10:22:53] <nights> thanks for the research
[10:22:55] <nights> let me see
[10:22:57] <shoky> np
[10:29:58] <shoky> what does the 'mai' stand for?
[10:30:19] <shoky> maishoku...... mai-food!
[10:30:43] <shoky> or hm mai-dining
[10:32:26] <shoky> OH.
[10:32:28] <shoky> my :)
[10:39:20] <lolzie> How can I remove the text from within  a <textarea> ?
[10:40:23] <lolzie> Scratch that actually, think I've solved, sorry
[10:49:55] <Hawkee> what's the easiest way to get the index for an element where there are more than one on the page
[10:50:06] <gnarf> ?index
[10:50:07] <bot-t> .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[10:53:54] <Hawkee> perfect gnarf, thank you
[10:58:07] <Whirl3d> Good afternoon channel.
[10:59:19] <Whirl3d> When setting up an anonymous function that refers to a local variable to be used in an asynchronous callback, if the local variable changes before the callback is execute, does the calback recognize it?
[11:01:53] <aJacom> Hello. There's no reason why preventing the default behavior of $('a').click() would affect crawlers while indexing the site, isn't there
[11:01:55] <aJacom> ?
[11:03:34] <Whirl3d> alacom, I can't imagine that it would cause problems. .preventDefault is very common
[11:04:48] <Whirl3d> don't crawlers analyze the text content and not the rendered material? I think a crawler would not be hindered by any javascript as it is just text...but I am no expert.
[11:05:17] <aJacom> Whirl3d, besides, maybe I'm a bit prehistoric, but I believe crawlers don't even run JavaScript code.
[11:06:04] <aJacom> Its good enough, though. Thank you
[11:08:12] <Whirl3d> There's a great article on webcrawling at wikipedia.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler
[11:09:41] <lenswipe> hey guys
[11:09:43] <lenswipe> anyone around?
[11:09:59] <Whirl3d> not like it usually is in here. but yeah.
[11:13:57] <nights> shoky: its fixed now :) thanks for your hlep
[11:14:02] <lenswipe> http://imagebin.org/207119
[11:14:11] <lenswipe> im trying to find a nicer way to show that stuff
[11:14:13] <lenswipe> can someone help?
[11:14:27] <lenswipe> i needd to show the tabular data but make it look integrated with the form
[11:14:29] <lenswipe> so it kind of flows
[11:14:52] <lenswipe> the data in the table is part of one row, the rest of the row is acquired using the form
[11:16:05] <Whirl3d> lenswipe, it's unclear what your form is doing.
[11:16:27] <lenswipe> there is a table in my database right?
[11:16:36] <lenswipe> it stores information about video conference bookings
[11:16:40] <Whirl3d> yes.
[11:16:46] <lenswipe> half of that info i already have such as location, date, time etc
[11:17:00] <lenswipe> however the rest of the info is keyed in at a later date by another member of staff using the form
[11:17:01] <Whirl3d> Is this a comment system or something?
[11:17:09] <lenswipe> and thats what my form is doing :)
[11:17:17] <lenswipe> its a VC booking system for my university
[11:17:25] <sunbeam> is jquery/ajax an acceptable way atm for handling forms (simple subscribe form) ?
[11:17:27] <nights> VC?
[11:17:30] <nights> venture capital?
[11:17:32] <lenswipe> Video Conference
[11:17:48] <lenswipe> the comments is where the member of staff (the guy that arranges the VCs) can type in to say like "This one needs to be in high def" or whatever
[11:18:24] <Whirl3d> Well then you need to make  the comments a sub-component of the table
[11:19:16] <Whirl3d> But it might be a good idea to have a row of utlity buttons under your form that when clicked popped open a modal form for note editing
[11:19:28] <Whirl3d> then you comment/notes could be added to the form using the table format.
[11:20:03] <lenswipe> hmm
[11:20:15] <lenswipe> the thing is i want to keep my form elements out of the table for obvious reasons
[11:20:34] <Whirl3d> Also, I would separate the date/time information to the right of the table and the phone/location on the left.
[11:20:47] <Whirl3d> Sure. That's why a popup form would be great
[11:20:54] <lenswipe> hmm
[11:20:57] <Whirl3d> you'ld never see the form elements until someone requested them
[11:21:13] <lenswipe> not sure that would work though
[11:21:21] <lenswipe> im thinking of doing away with the table and just using <h3>s
[11:21:39] <lenswipe> <h3> Conference Name</h3> <p>Advanced Phsyc</p>
[11:21:42] <lenswipe> like that
[11:21:50] <Whirl3d> Probably a good idea.
[11:22:27] <Whirl3d> I hear people hate tables for some reason. I don't use them (even though at times I think they'd make my life easier) just because I get yelled at in here every time I try to use a table. LOL
[11:23:05] <lenswipe> brb....dinner
[11:23:20] <lenswipe> Whirl3d, i dont hate them, i just dont think they fit with this use case...
[11:25:16] <crutex> SHORYUKEN
[11:25:38] <Whirl3d> I try to keep my presentation logic separate from my data logic, but I'm not that great at it. I like to make it so that my data can be easily formatted to fit a table, a running text block, etc.
[11:48:18] <|RicharD|> hello
[11:48:26] <|RicharD|> how i can create a button as interest ?

[12:14:37] <ircjsbot> pifantastic: ur an alligator
[12:17:45] <Mads> I have a minor issue with some code! i can't figure out whether its jQuery or MY script? i have this gallery ( http://jsfiddle.net/DkDqc/3/ ) based on flexslider, and have made a thumbnailsbar? but when switching fast with the thumbnails, it sometimes require a few clicks and some waiting before i can switch back to image1? is it mine or jQuerys fault?
[12:32:07] <sunbeam> any clue how come google cannot load jquery 1.7.2.?
[12:32:16] <sunbeam> google.load("jquery","1.7.2");
[12:32:18] <sunbeam> Module: 'jquery' with version '1.7.2' not found!
[12:33:20] <ravenzz> does it find the 1.7.1 ?
[12:33:35] <sunbeam> neither
[12:33:41] <sunbeam> google quit hosting jquery?
[12:34:08] <sunbeam> ah it does 1.7.1. sorry
[12:34:56] <Mads> can you load 1.7.2 through the normal google CDN link?
[12:36:08] <sunbeam> Mads: which is that
[12:36:43] <ravenzz> maybe the api repositories are not updated yet
[12:36:47] <Mads> i can see that they have updated to 1.7.2 :O https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide#jquery
[12:37:43] <ravenzz> sunbeam can't you use a regular script tag?
[12:43:58] <sunbeam> ravenzz: of course but google is faster
[12:44:13] <ravenzz> uh why?
[12:44:43] <ravenzz> you have to load its api and jquery after that
[12:45:04] <ravenzz> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
[12:45:35] <HardFu> what's the best way to observer two fields, and do a multiplication of the values inside?
[12:46:41] <sunbeam> ah yes
[12:46:55] <sunbeam> ill just load it directly with <script> than ks
[12:59:14] <shoky> nights: great ;)

[13:01:38] <RachelR> Hello, is there any way to do a read-only Split Button List (http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-split.html) except the icon is clickable?
[13:06:20] <Mads> I have a minor issue with some code! i can't figure out whether its jQuery or MY script? i have this gallery ( http://jsfiddle.net/DkDqc/3/ ) based on flexslider, and have made a thumbnailsbar? but when switching fast with the thumbnails, it sometimes require a few clicks and some waiting before i can switch back to image1? is it mine or jQuerys fault?
[13:14:23] <Whirl3d> ugg, where is everyone today?
[13:19:27] <tEcE> Mads:possible to see it in action ?
[13:19:51] <Mads> jup at my jsfiddle :) http://jsfiddle.net/DkDqc/3/
[13:20:20] <Mads> tEcE > http://jsfiddle.net/DkDqc/3/ :)
[13:28:07] <f0rkn1ght> Follow me @StevenPeterson_ for latest snippets, codex fixes, and more!
[13:30:00] <RachelR> anyone here familiar with using lawnchair for json storage?
[14:04:37] <imsky> what are you degenerates up to
[14:05:35] <Whirl3d> the silent treatment, I'm afraid...
[14:06:03] <imsky> lol
[14:06:39] <Mads> if you are bored, you can help me out lol :D
[14:07:18] <shoky> mads maybe if you make a proper fiddle
[14:07:28] <shoky> without minified code pasted into it....
[14:08:04] <shoky> that's what the 'Add Resources' is for
[14:09:42] <Mads> shoky: but what if the problem lies within the file i added to resources? ? i just added it to the javascript window, in case of the problem was with the Flexslider API
[14:10:08] <Mads> And i actually thought i had included the proper, non-minified version :) http://jsfiddle.net/DkDqc/4/
[14:12:18] <shoky> how do i reproduce the problem in that fiddle
[14:12:42] <shoky> javascript window is for your javascript code
[14:12:49] <shoky> html window shouldn't have <html> or <body> or <script>
[14:17:38] <Whirl3d> Once I create a custom event and bind it to an element, how do I later determine if an element has that event bound?
[14:17:56] <lolzie> I want my button to invoke a function and pass itself to it (ordinarily I'd pass `this' if I wasnt jquerying) onclick, so I can use .closest() on it, how should I do it?
[14:19:02] <shoky> Whirl3d you can check the elements .data('events')
[14:19:04] <Whirl3d> $(elem).click(function (e) {$(this).closest(holderClass).not($(this)).doSomething();)});
[14:19:29] <Whirl3d> shoky, thanks.
[14:20:34] <lolzie> Whirl3d: thanks, might you be able to show me another thing please - I have $block, which contains two buttons.  I want to replace a substring in the attribute of both, how can I do it for both?
[14:20:49] <lolzie> Stuff like attr() is only meant to do for the first element in a set I think
[14:21:06] <Whirl3d> lolzie, you could use .each
[14:21:25] <Mads> shoky: i think i can come closer then this :) http://jsfiddle.net/DkDqc/9/
[14:21:29] <Whirl3d> but you could more easily use .on
[14:23:08] <Whirl3d> like this:  $('#block").on("click", "a", function (e) { $(this).find("a").each(function () {$(this).attr("href',something);}) (and then some combination of }) that I would muddle through
[14:23:22] <ChrisPitzer> hey all. I've got a REALLY EXPENSIVE process. it's hashing a shit ton of things in the browser, and takes around 10 seconds.
[14:23:33] <ChrisPitzer> i'd like to have a progress bar show me how far it's gotten...
[14:23:46] <ChrisPitzer> but the dom doesn't like to update while the cpu is hogged.
[14:23:50] <Whirl3d> so it will take 20 seconds, cool
[14:23:55] <ChrisPitzer> ... any thoughts?
[14:23:57] <imsky> web workers
[14:24:03] <imsky> welcome to 2009 or so
[14:24:08] <shoky> Mads: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/DkDqc/7/
[14:24:17] <shoky> Mads sorry i mean: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/DkDqc/10/
[14:24:25] <shoky> that's looking more like a proper fiddle
[14:24:33] <shoky> except the css window
[14:24:48] <ChrisPitzer> imsky: are those ubiquitous?
[14:24:50] <shoky> Mads why did you use $(window).load
[14:25:00] <imsky> ChrisPitzer: http://caniuse.com
[14:25:49] <Mads> good question actually? is document a better idea?
[14:26:12] <shoky> $(document).ready
[14:26:14] <shoky> check my fiddle
[14:27:04] <ChrisPitzer> imsky: so - it looks like web workers are only supported in ~25% of browsers out there.
[14:27:14] <Mads> im looking at it? but its like i can't the the resources? when clicking run, it just shows the three images...
[14:27:18] <ChrisPitzer> 2 years from now i'll be golden. :)
[14:27:43] <shoky> mads what? i see the flexslider switching images
[14:28:16] <shoky> mads, i posted a second link in the next line
[14:28:18] <Mads> oh sorry! i only saw your first link to revision 9 :)'
[14:28:20] <shoky> k ;)
[14:28:25] <shoky> hey raj
[14:28:30] <raj> hey there :)
[14:28:46] <shoky> g'afternoon
[14:29:06] <arkh_> ChrisPitzer: can you just split the work into pieces, say 10 or 100, and report progress at the end of each piece?
[14:29:20] <Mads> but when clicking on the thumbnails? it's just like thumbnail 1 becomes unresponsive and doesnt react to the clicking....
[14:29:42] <ChrisPitzer> arkh_: i am doin that now
[14:29:47] <ChrisPitzer> it's split into 100 pieces.
[14:30:06] <ChrisPitzer> and after each piece i update my progress bar to be 1% wider.
[14:30:13] <arkh_> sure
[14:30:17] <ChrisPitzer> ... but it's not updating until the end.
[14:30:25] <ChrisPitzer> can i force a dom flush?
[14:30:30] <ChrisPitzer> force update?
[14:33:08] <Mads> thumbnail 1 works the first time, maybe the second time i click it? but then?. it just?. dies?
[14:34:07] <arkh_> ChrisPitzer: there should be a better way, e.g. kick off each piece of work in a set interval and update at the end of each
[14:34:17] <arkh_> *setinterval
[14:34:49] <RachelR> prob not the best channel for the subj but if anyone knows anything about JSON and Lawnchair, please help! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10058570/getting-lawnchair-json-obj-after-storing
[14:34:51] <arkh_> sorry, that's silly.  Do a setTimeout() instead
[14:35:22] <someprimetime> ajpiano: yo
[14:35:25] <someprimetime> you going to jquery con?
[14:35:26] <someprimetime> in SF?
[14:35:29] <ChrisPitzer> ug
[14:35:50] <ChrisPitzer> arkh_: i'm playing with setTimeout now...
[14:35:55] <shoky> Mads it's because the flex shit has an invisible div on top of your first thumbnail
[14:35:58] <shoky> it's blocking some of the clicks
[14:36:20] <shoky> if you go to a point where its not responding, then in that exact point right click->inspect element
[14:36:25] <shoky> and you'll get to that flex div
[14:36:29] <Mads> you're joking right?
[14:36:31] <shoky> nope
[14:36:41] <arkh_> ChrisPitzer: setTimeout( work, 100) and have it call another setTimeout at the end of each piece
[14:36:41] <Mads> Am i THAT dumb?
[14:36:53] <shoky> <ol class="flex-control-nav"> is the element thats on top of it
[14:37:23] <arkh_> ChrisPitzer: er, setTimeout(work, 10) ... I should look before I type
[14:37:53] <Mads> no no no no no ! but THANKS! i have spend like forever with the tiny piece of code
[14:38:14] <shoky> .flex-control-nav {width: 100%; position: absolute; bottom: -30px; text-align: center;}
[14:38:21] <shoky> that -30px is causing the problem
[14:38:28] <shoky> np
[14:38:53] <Mads> im killing those controls for good!
[14:38:58] <shoky> yayz
[14:40:19] <altin> hello guys
[14:40:35] <altin> can anyone tell me how can I put my jquery banner back
[14:40:43] <altin> because it is blocking my menu to open ?!
[14:42:14] <shoky> wat
[14:42:57] <ChrisPitzer> arkh_: does set timeout make the work async?
[14:43:17] <arkh_> ChrisPitzer: yes
[14:43:35] <ChrisPitzer> ok... so nested loops will have race conditions then... possibly...
[14:43:39] <arkh_> ChrisPitzer: do you'll want callbacks to do subsequent pieces
[14:43:44] <ChrisPitzer> yeah
[14:44:25] <arkh_> ChrisPitzer: it's more cumbersome to program it that way but it's the only way to maintain a responsive UI
[14:44:44] <arkh_> ChrisPitzer: short of web workers
[14:45:04] <lolzie> Umm, is there any reason why this shouldn't work in IE (but work in Chrome & FF)? orange_juice = $("#orange_" + id).find('[name="orange_name"]').val();
[14:45:05] <Mads> altin: try z-index
[14:45:30] <lolzie> I get "Object doesn't support this property or method" in IE :|
[14:45:44] <altin> Mads, z-indez: howmuch ??
[14:45:48] <Horizons> lolzie, yea. IE sucks. IMO
[14:45:57] <shoky> LOLZY
[14:46:03] <Mads> dunno?. try
[14:46:34] <shoky> altin, put a higher z-index on whatever you want in front
[14:46:38] <lolzie> Horizons: I don't think there's anyone on this entire IRC network that doesn't share that opinion
[14:46:45] <lolzie> Either way I need this to work in IE :/
[14:46:48] <Horizons> :)
[14:47:04] <shoky> lolzie can you fiddle it
[14:47:22] <lolzie> shoky: excuse me?
[14:47:27] <shoky> ?demo
[14:47:27] <someprimetime> jsfiddle @ lolzie
[14:47:36] <someprimetime> ?jsfiddle @ lolzi
[14:47:41] <someprimetime> no bot :(
[14:47:47] <shoky> lolzie, paste your html/code in www.jsfiddle.com
[14:47:53] <shoky> so we can see the problem too
[14:48:03] <shoky> and try to help
[14:49:07] <shoky> now.. where do i hide my drugs
[14:50:12] <lolzie> shoky: thanks, making a minimal case for it
[14:51:26] <shoky> thats the idea
[15:01:14] <lolzie> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/aSTHU/
[15:01:56] <lolzie> No error in Chrome/FF, but in IE.  Minimised it as a test case, so the button doesn't actually have a visible function anyway
[15:04:28] <lolzie> My code today became unexpectedly js-heavy - I dreaded checking out IE at the end of it :/
[15:05:42] <shoky> lolzie
[15:05:43] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/aSTHU/2/
[15:06:09] <shoky> i'm not getting any error in IE
[15:06:34] <lolzie>  I do :/
[15:06:43] <lolzie> Did my original example trigger one for you?
[15:06:46] <shoky> nope
[15:06:52] <lolzie> whaaat
[15:07:00] <lolzie> Which IE you using?
[15:07:03] <shoky> is your IE in some lame compatibility mode maybe?
[15:07:05] <shoky> 9
[15:07:21] <lolzie> Oh
[15:07:23] <lolzie> This one's 8
[15:07:29] <shoky> ah. yuck
[15:08:01] <shoky> yea i see the error
[15:08:33] <lolzie> :o do tell!
[15:08:56] <shoky> what
[15:09:09] <lolzie> Oh sorry
[15:09:16] <lolzie> I thought you meant an error in my code which could be resolved
[15:10:48] <lolzie> shoky: omg I sussed it.
[15:11:03] <lolzie> Apparently, IE8 dies whenever a variable is declared without 'var'. :/
[15:11:23] <Eviltwin> Well a variable should never be declared without var
[15:11:52] <lolzie> Eviltwin: yeah I know, but I didn't think IE8 would be the flagship of good practices
[15:12:51] <Eviltwin> If you're in strict mode, this will happen
[15:13:06] <altin> shoky, I cant seem to find the right place to put a z-inde: 1000
[15:13:06] <shoky> lolzie ah right, forgot about that shit
[15:13:12] <altin> it still getting hided
[15:13:24] <shoky> altin and i cant help you without seeing what you're doing
[15:13:28] <altin> http://82.114.84.33:70
[15:13:55] <shoky> menu seems fine
[15:14:00] <altin> you have to move fast to the dropdown to select it
[15:14:09] <altin> otherwise it will get hided again
[15:14:10] <shoky> ah
[15:14:14] <altin> check about
[15:14:25] <shoky> i dont think that is related to z-index
[15:14:52] <altin> yeah :S
[15:14:57] <altin> manu is jquery too
[15:15:01] <altin> menu*
[15:15:04] <altin> same as banner
[15:16:12] <shoky> try putting them both in a jsfiddle that shows the problem and someone here will gladly help you
[15:16:16] <shoky> as for me, gtg ;p
[15:17:32] <altin> shoky,  jsfiddle ?
[15:18:52] <shoky> put your html/css/javascript in www.jsfiddle.com
[15:18:59] <shoky> so that it shows the problem
[15:19:17] <shoky> add the plugin resources with 'add resources'
[15:19:26] <shoky> buhbye
[15:21:28] <Michalos> hello
[15:23:14] <Michalos> how to slideUp and slideDown each table individually? http://vip-picks.com/records_exclusive/ ?
[15:26:51] <Michalos> who resolve this problem?
[15:49:49] <Logikos> i know there is a way to preform an action after a jquery animation, but is there a way to preform an action at half way through it?
[15:51:00] <arkh_> Logikos: I think you'd need to make two animations and perform the action after the first one
[15:53:02] <Logikos> well, i'm makeing a thing that rotates though pictures fadeing one in while fadeing another out, and with markers (tabs) to indcate which one is active...
[15:53:20] <Logikos> and i want to switch which tab has the class="active" half way though the fade animation
[15:53:47] <Logikos> i supose i could use a timer to 1/2 animation duration
[15:53:50] <Logikos> ...
[15:54:00] <Logikos> set the timer then do the animation ?
[15:56:08] <dman777> what is the channel for javascript?
[15:56:36] <Logikos> dman777: take a guess, u can do it
[15:56:58] <RandalSchwartz> try #actionscript :)
[15:56:59] <dman777> lol thanks
[15:57:00] <Logikos> if the channel for jquery is #jquery .. the channel for javascript is ...
[15:57:12] <sssilver> :D
[15:57:14] <RandalSchwartz> or #fortran77
[15:57:18] <RandalSchwartz> they know a lot about JS
[15:57:51] <RandalSchwartz> ask in #rubyonrails - they like JS questions there
[15:58:53] <westg> this might be a dumb question but if I'm applying a specific set of css rules to a div then identifying it via #id makes more sense then putting a .class on it right?
[15:59:03] <westg> to one div only*
[15:59:15] <westg> each div is unique basically
[15:59:45] <westg> at least for now it is
[16:03:22] <sssilver> so like, is jquery ui the most awesome jquery ui framework out there?
[16:03:28] <sssilver> or there's some better stuff?
[16:04:04] <RandalSchwartz> twitter bootstrap has some good things
[16:04:07] <RandalSchwartz> YUI is also good
[16:06:55] <sssilver> I just need beautiful UI controls (like buttons and input elements) + forms validation
[16:10:40] <gloomer> no matter which framework you pick it takes work to make them integrate beautifully
[16:20:36] <Whirl3d> I find that #css is the best for js questions, really
[16:42:23] <dman777> is it necessary to learn javascript to learn jquery?
[16:42:33] <Logikos> if an animation is set to occure at an inverval via a timer, can an event interrupt an animation should it be part way finished, to cause it to just jump to final position ?
[16:43:14] <bishopz> $('#elem').stop().animate({})
[16:43:48] <Logikos> that will stop any and all animations on #elem ?
[16:44:13] <bishopz> $('#elem').stop(true, true).animate({})
[16:44:19] <bishopz> http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[16:44:24] <Logikos> ty, looking it up
[16:44:53] <RandalSchwartz> check out http://css-tricks.com/examples/jQueryStop/ for useful tips though
[16:46:48] <bishopz> Hey yall, I just released my first github project, would love some feedback: https://github.com/bishopZ/Frame.js
[16:56:57] <Logikos> hi, in this fiddle, rotate() is not being called with any arguments, but in the function defnition a varable called tab can be set as an argument, i did console.log(tab) to see what its value is should no value be sent ... but its outputing random integers? http://jsfiddle.net/LV2pa/3/
[16:57:14] <Logikos> can someone please tell me why the console is showing that that way?
[17:00:37] <bishopz> timer=setTimeout(function() { rotate(tab) },initDelay);
[17:00:42] <bishopz> or use Frame.js
[17:01:30] <Logikos> so the setTimeout() is sending an argument of some kind for some reason?
[17:02:01] <bishopz> not sure exactly, but i don't think setTimeout sends anything
[17:02:38] <bishopz> but maybe it sends something
[17:02:43] <Logikos> well i'll wrap rotate in a function to see if that changes it
[17:02:50] <Logikos> ty for the advice
[17:03:06] <bishopz> np, bbl
[17:04:37] <Logikos> that solved it, interesting
[17:04:42] <Logikos> now console is printing undefined
[17:04:45] <Logikos> as i'd expect...
[17:04:50] <Logikos> ty
[17:19:49] <Logikos> if i had tabs = $('#someid').children(); ... and i wanted to set an event such as rotate( index of tabs child ) .. on click of each child ... how would i do that?
[17:20:16] <Logikos> i imagin i'd use $(tabs).each(); ... but how to reference the index ?
[17:21:35] <Logikos> lol, sorry, i think i just found the answer...
[17:22:55] <Lobosque> How do I get the select box display text instead its value? for example, if option <option value='foo'>Bar</option> is selected, I need to get Bar instead foo.
[17:23:51] <Logikos> .innerHTML ?
[17:24:10] <Logikos> just a guess, i'm very green ...
[17:26:32] <gloomer> Lobosque .text()
[17:26:35] <gloomer> instead of .val()
[17:28:13] <Lobosque> gloomer, do not work very well... looks like it takes the text of every option?
[17:28:47] <gloomer> well what does your code look like
[17:29:33] <Lobosque> I just tried a blindshot and it worked :)
[17:29:46] <Lobosque> $('#foo option:selected').text()
[17:30:43] <gloomer> :selected will  do
[17:30:48] <gloomer> don't need the option part
[17:31:31] <dabear> option:selected is faster than just :selected
[17:31:33] <dabear> :)
[17:32:52] <gloomer> really why?
[17:33:23] <dabear> because :selected is a shorthand for *:selected
[17:33:48] <dabear> which potentially selects more elements, and is therefore slower
[17:34:19] <gloomer> in what situation would that get more elements from a select list?
[17:35:07] <dabear> it wouldn't
[17:35:15] <dabear> but the selector is less optimized
[17:38:55] <dabear> but anyway, both are very fast
[17:39:03] <dabear> so little point in optimizing it
[18:03:04] <KingInky> run into a bit of a problem here. im trying to use jquery from within faye event handler closures (same idea as socket.io, etc). listens for messages and takes an action. jquery seems to be inaccessible from within the closures.
[18:03:15] <KingInky> i can't think of how to get access from within the closures.
[18:04:22] <KingInky> http://pastebin.com/2Q6hSB34 -- code for anyone who wants to help me out.
[18:08:11] <KingInky> figured it out. conflict with using $
[18:08:31] <alexr2> glad we could help
[18:13:52] <xananax> Hello, I was wondering: let's say I have a bunch of element and I want to keep track of their scroll position in order to trigger stuff; I have got the part where I track the position and convert it to a percentage right, no prob. But how would I update this on the object in order to act on it with css?
[18:14:28] <xananax> If I simply add the class "scroll-xx", they will add up, and I'll have an object with class="scroll-01 scroll-02 scroll-03" etc
[18:15:19] <xananax> I could do a regex on existing classes and remove all classes beginning with "scroll", but I am wondering if there is a more efficient way
[18:17:55] <alexr2> xananax, i'm confused as to what you're asking, can you explain what you're trying to do a little better
[18:18:24] <xananax> yeah ok sorry I should have thought more before writing, give me 1mn to craft my words better
[18:19:19] <xananax> Ok so here goes: I have an element $('.section'), on scroll, I want to add classes to it so I can, for example, change it's background according to the scroll value
[18:19:34] <RandalSchwartz> s/it's/its/
[18:20:03] <xananax> so when the user scrolls up to 50% of the page, I want to add a class "scroll-50" to it
[18:20:17] <alexr2> .addClass
[18:20:17] <xananax> And this is incremental, so I get all the values from 0 to 100
[18:20:26] <xananax> yeah, addClass works, but here is my prob
[18:20:41] <xananax> the event does not always fire, so I don't know what the last class added was
[18:20:58] <alexr2> what event?
[18:21:02] <xananax> It could be the one just before, or it could have jumped from scroll-45 to scroll-76
[18:21:05] <xananax> scroll event
[18:21:19] <KingInky> RandalSchwartz: there must be some channel where you can help people with their grammar. you'd do well to consider the fact that not everyone is a native english-speaker. don't be a fucking douche when someone is just asking for help.
[18:21:49] <xananax> KingInky, thanks but it's ok, no offense taken, I'm cool with honing my english skills
[18:21:57] <alexr2> oO
[18:22:12] <xananax> So my first thought was ok, let's do a regex on the classes and remove all classes that begin with "scroll"
[18:22:16] <xananax> And it works
[18:22:25] <xananax> but I figured there should be a more efficient way
[18:22:46] <xananax> And here I am, asking how people keep track of such values in a way that it is exposed to css
[18:23:30] <xananax> I also thought of incrementing a custom "data-scroll" attribute and do .section[data-scroll:xx] in css
[18:23:34] <xananax> but it seems cumbersome to me
[18:23:55] <alexr2> xananax, what are you using to catch the scroll event?
[18:23:59] <alexr2> well you don't need to do regex, you can just do a selector $('[id^=.scroll]')
[18:24:14] <xananax> I am using a timer
[18:24:49] <xananax> Because apparently chrome fires the scroll event too much and it can slow down code
[18:25:52] <alexr2> rather no . in there
[18:26:03] <xananax> alexr2, no, it seems once again I am unclear, I want to remove all classes that begin with "scroll" from my object, not select it. My object is selected and stored
[18:26:29] <alexr2> ahh
[18:26:58] <xananax> Or not use classes alltogether
[18:27:59] <xananax> Ok I notice there it's not clear enough for people to help. I 'll go on with my current implementation, put it online and ask again with a proper example
[18:30:10] <alexr2> naah
[18:30:10] <alexr2> hold on
[18:30:10] <alexr2> so you have an element selected, and want to remove any class that it has that starts with scroll... correct?
[18:31:07] <xananax> yeah, in fact I want to increment/decrement it, so in effect, selecting any previous class that begins with "scroll-" and replace it with the new "scroll-xx"
[18:31:25] <xananax> But as I said, a regex replace on the class attribute does the trick
[18:31:36] <xananax> it's just that I fear that it will be slow (I have many elements)
[18:31:44] <xananax> and I am wondering if there is a better way
[18:31:46] <Whirl3d> anybody familiar with how to effectively use the pushStack or queue methods with a custom queue (not fx)
[18:34:12] <Whirl3d> xananax, what are you trying to accomplish?
[18:34:44] <xananax> Whirl3d, I am trying to set-up a framework for doing these nifty background animations that trigger as you scroll
[18:35:02] <xananax> So I am keeping for each relevant object it's scrolling value relative to the viewport
[18:35:14] <xananax> But I don't want to animate in javascript
[18:35:27] <xananax> I want to simply add/remove classes and do the animation through css3
[18:36:00] <xananax> So for each element, I want to keep a class that is named anything from "scroll-000" to "scroll-100"
[18:36:17] <xananax> And it can change several times per second
[18:36:28] <Whirl3d> then calculate the percentage scroll position and change the data attribute for each object. I think it'll be much faster
[18:37:08] <xananax> And then through css do an attribute selector? For example .element[data-scroll=30] ?
[18:37:35] <Whirl3d> Yeah if you don't want to use js. to adjust the position
[18:38:37] <Whirl3d> are you trying to create css3 parralax?
[18:38:45] <xananax> Yup
[18:39:03] <Whirl3d> then consider the css3 3d transforms
[18:39:15] <xananax> What do you mean?
[18:39:43] <Whirl3d> gimme a second to see if I can find a tutorial I just watched yesterday. It was all about css3 parralaxx.
[18:39:50] <xananax> k cool
[18:44:46] <gloomer> http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/03/15/parallax-content-slider-with-css3-and-jquery/
[18:45:02] <Whirl3d> http://cssatoms.com/basic/creating-a-parallax-effect-in-css3-2/
[18:45:18] <Whirl3d> I think that's the one that I liked the best. I saw so many of them yesterday.
[18:46:17] <Guest47412> Hello, I'm unable to find the documentation for function $() by entering the function name '$' inside the search box at the top of http://api.jquery.com/ , is that normal / am I missing something?
[18:46:50] <Whirl3d> $ == jquery
[18:46:55] <kenneth> hey, so i'm having trouble with a lightbox, specifically pre-loading the image and getting its size prior to showing it. here's my relevant code (using query lightbox plugin): https://gist.github.com/0aa41d8f76afb2c974f3
[18:47:00] <kenneth> i'm getting a $(this).height() and width of zero, throwing off my calculations and fucking things up
[18:47:28] <Whirl3d> try innerWidth()
[18:47:38] <xananax> Guest47412,  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[18:47:45] <Guest47412> yep, whirl3d, it's at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/ thanx a lot
[18:47:48] <kenneth> doesn't .load on an image tag get called once the image has been loaded and has a width / height?
[18:47:52] <Guest47412> thanx to xananax too :D
[18:47:55] <xananax> Whirl3d, gloomer, alexr2 : thanks!
[18:48:19] <kenneth> ok trying
[18:48:46] <kenneth> ditto, 0px with inner too
[18:49:07] <xananax> kenneth, I know this one, ready() does not do it
[18:49:12] <Whirl3d> setup a jsfiddle and I'll look at it.
[18:49:35] <kenneth> what's a jsfiddle?
[18:49:54] <Whirl3d> It's the greatest. It's a sandbox that you can easily use to test js
[18:50:01] <Whirl3d> jsfiddle.net
[18:50:56] <gloomer> ya super nice
[18:51:07] <xananax> kenneth, try $(document).load
[18:51:10] <Whirl3d> setup your load handler before assigning the src attr
[18:52:02] <Whirl3d> so it would look like: var image=new Image(); var img=$(image); img.load(loadHandler).attr("src",url);
[18:52:21] <xananax> And do know that load() doesn't always fire
[18:52:35] <xananax> If you are getting images from your cache for example, then it won't
[18:52:45] <Whirl3d> that's why right after your load statement, you check if the element is loaded like this:
[18:52:53] <kenneth> ah yes
[18:53:12] <Whirl3d> if (image.complete) {loadHandler()};
[18:53:40] <Whirl3d> that should solve problems with i.e. not firing the load handler on cached images
[18:53:46] <Whirl3d> but you should also avoid .live
[18:53:50] <gloomer> jsfiddle with firebug = even better
[18:55:32] <xananax> kenneth, ready() fires when the dom is ready, load() fires when all sub-documents have been loaded, so you should 1) put this code in load(), 2) do as Whirl3d advised
[18:57:52] <kenneth> so Whirl3d, load will not fire for cached images?
[18:58:10] <xananax> kenneth, depends on browsers
[18:58:14] <Whirl3d> On occasion, load does not fire in i.e. for cached images
[18:59:02] <xananax> kenneth, the right way to do it is: on dom ready, you build an array of images, and attach onload events to them, decouple the load event by giving it it's own function
[18:59:06] <Whirl3d> But kenneth, you biggest problem is likely the use of .live
[18:59:12] <xananax> in the load event, remove the image from the array
[18:59:26] <kenneth> Whirl3d: i'm using live because i'm adding stuff to the dom
[18:59:36] <Whirl3d> .on works MUCH better.
[19:00:04] <Whirl3d> in fact, you can specify which parent element you are loading the images into rather than the enitre dom
[19:00:04] <xananax> on dom load, loop through the array and for all images that remain, fire the onload event (they should have loaded in $(window).load())
[19:00:43] <Whirl3d> It looks like you are creating the images dynamically based on the href value of aan anchor element, right?
[19:01:55] <kenneth> yeah
[19:02:09] <Whirl3d> I'll set up a fiddle to show you. brb
[19:02:47] <kenneth> here's my live use case btw, http://kswizz.com/post/14943351212/working-on-a-totally-unrelated-project-i-made
[19:02:49] <Whirl3d> is article the name of a class?
[19:02:57] <kenneth> i made a fiddle out of it http://jsfiddle.net/pkNQ2/ too
[19:03:03] <kenneth> article is the html5 tag
[19:05:18] <Whirl3d> Cant you just call lightbox with a url and it'll load and show it
[19:08:39] <Whirl3d> which lightbox plugin are you using?
[19:10:14] <kenneth> http://buckwilson.me/lightboxme/
[19:10:21] <kenneth> it only supports showing a dom element
[19:10:43] <kenneth> and i need to give the element a width etc. because otherwise it'll think it's 0/0 before the image is loaded
[19:10:50] <kenneth> sorry i'm slow to reply, hacking away trying a few things
[19:11:37] <kenneth> now i'm having this weird problem that appeared out of nowhere where my return false is not invalidating the click event
[19:13:55] <kenneth> ok it seems to have fixed itself, odd
[19:23:30] <kenneth> !mdn Image
[19:40:50] <Gotenks_ssj4> how i can make a text link execute a javascript code .post?
[19:41:00] <Gotenks_ssj4> a image
[19:41:35] <alexr2> $(selector).click(function() { $.ajax/$.post/$.get(); return false; });
[19:42:32] <Gotenks_ssj4> what is selector?
[19:43:13] <xec> like css, just give it a string, like $("a") will select all <a> elements
[19:43:53] <xec> what is "a text link" ?
[19:44:09] <Gotenks_ssj4> sorry
[19:44:15] <Gotenks_ssj4> is image link
[19:44:30] <xec> ok. what is "image link"?
[19:44:45] <xec> an <img> wrapped in an <a>?
[19:44:59] <Gotenks_ssj4> is a image with url link
[19:45:06] <Gotenks_ssj4> yes
[19:45:22] <xec> Gotenks_ssj4: what does your html look like?
[19:45:40] <Gotenks_ssj4> is a addfriend button
[19:45:47] <Gotenks_ssj4> for my chat script
[19:45:59] <Gotenks_ssj4> the button is a image
[19:46:17] <xec> paste your html in a pastebin, see ?p
[19:46:24] <Gotenks_ssj4> and i wont the user loads other page when he clicks on addfriend
[19:46:35] <Gotenks_ssj4> ok
[19:46:37] <xec> ?p
[19:46:43] <xec> come on bot-t
[19:46:56] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[19:46:57] <Gotenks_ssj4> i cant is too unorganized to understand
[19:47:04] <Gotenks_ssj4> jejeje
[19:47:30] <gloomer> if you can't organize it on to a jsfiddle your in trouble
[19:47:58] <xec> Gotenks_ssj4: if your code is too organized to understand i would suggest you organize it ;)
[19:48:04] <xec> too unorganized*
[19:48:06] <Gotenks_ssj4> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/577757/
[19:48:08] <Gotenks_ssj4> ok
[19:48:29] <Gotenks_ssj4> but the addfriend post function will go on a new php page
[19:51:04] <Gotenks_ssj4> see?
[19:51:09] <xec> not really
[19:51:20] <xec> what part of that paste is relevant?
[19:51:58] <Gotenks_ssj4> the add as friend link
[19:52:06] <xec> which is on line
[19:52:29] <Gotenks_ssj4> 109
[19:52:41] <xec> that doesn't look like an image to me
[19:52:47] <xec> it looks like a div
[19:53:02] <Gotenks_ssj4> because i did not make yep
[19:53:04] <Gotenks_ssj4> yet
[19:53:23] <Gotenks_ssj4> i want know what i put inside
[19:53:44] <Gotenks_ssj4> .click(function() { $.ajax/$.post/$.get(); return false; });
[19:53:45] <alexr2> I don't get what your actual question is Gotenks_ssj4,  we're not here to write code for you, we're here to help you with any issues you have with existing code... just sayin
[19:54:01] <Gotenks_ssj4> i know
[19:54:17] <Gotenks_ssj4> i just want understand what goes on selecttor
[19:54:26] <xec> if you want to be able to click on a div with that id you can do $("#apDiv4").click(function(){ /* do stuff */ });
[19:54:26] <alexr2> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[19:54:43] <Gotenks_ssj4> okkk
[19:54:49] <Gotenks_ssj4> now i understand
[19:54:52] <Gotenks_ssj4> =)
[19:55:03] <Gotenks_ssj4> that what was looking for
[19:55:16] <xec> you should really read some tutorials, helps you understand the basics
[19:55:40] <alexr2> Didn't that bot in here have shortcuts to a jquery for basics type tutorial?
[19:55:45] <alexr2> rather beginners
[19:56:01] <xec> not sure, but http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials is a good place to start ;)
[19:56:05] <Gotenks_ssj4> ok ok ok
[19:56:25] <Gotenks_ssj4> in the case of <img src="addfriend.jpg" width="128" height="23" />
[19:56:39] <Gotenks_ssj4> what i put on selector?
[19:56:55] <alexr2> Gotenks_ssj4, read through  http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[19:56:56] <Gotenks_ssj4> if the image dont have a name
[19:57:01] <alexr2> It has all that you need about selectors in there
[19:57:07] <alexr2> Including how to get that image selected
[19:57:40] <xec> Gotenks_ssj4: you need to learn things in this order: 1. HTML - 2. CSS - 3. jQuery
[19:57:53] <Gotenks_ssj4> i know html and css
[19:57:55] <alexr2> http://api.jquery.com/descendant-selector/ more precisely
[19:57:55] <Gotenks_ssj4> =)
[19:58:09] <alexr2> xec, you're missing plain ol javascript in that list :-P
[19:58:09] <xec> Gotenks_ssj4: what css selector would you write to style that image?
[19:58:32] <xec> alexr2: yeah. i was tired of typing ;D
[20:00:06] <xec> 5am here =(
[20:00:31] <alexr2> yikes
[20:00:32] <xec> i'm gonna go to bed. good night and good luck
[20:00:50] <alexr2> haha g'night
[20:00:51] <Gotenks_ssj4> [xec]: :image
[20:01:11] <alexr2> i have never seen a css image selected that way
[20:01:12] <xec> Gotenks_ssj4: you said you knew css, i take it you lied?
[20:01:17] <xec> :P
[20:01:37] <Gotenks_ssj4> :image is equivalent to [type="image"]
[20:02:10] <alexr2> as in input:text ?
[20:02:21] <xec> Gotenks_ssj4: wha? anyway - [type="image"] will NOT select <img>
[20:02:39] <Gotenks_ssj4> we use <img> so
[20:03:16] <xec> so what css selector would select <img> ?
[20:03:29] <alexr2> Are you referring to http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/sel_input_image.asp?
[20:04:10] <Gotenks_ssj4> as i told before
[20:04:22] <Gotenks_ssj4> $(":image")
[20:04:25] <xec> Gotenks_ssj4: well you were horribly wrong
[20:04:28] <alexr2> ^^
[20:04:30] <xec> Gotenks_ssj4: try again
[20:04:33] <alexr2> $('img')
[20:04:47] <xec> ding ding ding, 10 points for alexr2
[20:04:50] <alexr2> woo
[20:05:01] <xec> now in the lead by ten points
[20:05:02] <alexr2> w3schools isn't the best for tutorials
[20:05:20] <xec> w3schools is likely the worst
[20:05:27] <alexr2> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs
[20:05:39] <alexr2> Go through those tutorials on html/css/js/jquery in that order
[20:05:46] <alexr2> It'll make coding your website a LOT easier for you
[20:06:02] <alexr2> well, jquery tutorial on the jquery site
[20:06:28] <Gotenks_ssj4> this is not what i was asking for
[20:06:39] <xec> Gotenks_ssj4: no, but it IS what you need
[20:06:49] <Gotenks_ssj4> is not what i need
[20:06:58] <Gotenks_ssj4> i what specific image
[20:07:01] <Gotenks_ssj4> not all images
[20:07:11] <alexr2> You're asking us to code for you, we're pointing you towards places where you can learn how to do that yourself
[20:07:12] <xec> you need to learn to walk before you can run
[20:07:33] <alexr2> I already gave you the exact link that will show you how to select that image
[20:07:52] <Gotenks_ssj4> yes but i need sleep
[20:07:53] <xec> three times, i think
[20:07:55] <xec> lol
[20:08:07] <xec> then step one for both of us is sleep

[20:08:14] <Gotenks_ssj4> ok
[20:08:35] <Gotenks_ssj4> i am really tired
[20:19:14] <Whirl3d> Does anyone have any experience with deferreds?
[20:24:47] * Whirl3d shrugs his shoulders and mopes off into the background
[20:25:38] <alexr2> Sorry dude, never had to use them so no experience with them
[20:26:11] <Whirl3d> alexr2, thanks for the reply anways.
[20:32:34] <Whirl3d> so, i want to override a function that I added to the jquery.fn namespace for one class. Is that easy to do and if so, what is the best way to do it?
[20:33:21] <Whirl3d> I added an "exitStage" function, but for just one class, I want "exitStage" to wait until it's children have exited stage before it does.
[20:33:33] <astropirate> Whirl3d, jquery.fn.oldFunction = newfunctions  :S
[20:33:53] <astropirate> unless you meant something else
[20:34:31] <Whirl3d> astropirate, thanks for the reply. That would do it for every element, I want just one class to behave differently.
[20:35:19] <Whirl3d> so when I call $(".previewClass").exitStage().....it waits until all of it's children have finished their "exitStage" animations to run it's own
[20:36:31] <astropirate> make it accept an optional function as a prameter
[20:36:43] <astropirate> which should be called when the exitStage() or w/e is done
[20:37:12] <Whirl3d> great idea. I'll try it
[20:37:14] <Whirl3d> thanks
[20:53:50] <sqwk> How do I access the slider element of a jquery slider inside of its options array?
[20:54:42] <sqwk> trying to do something like this: http://pastie.org/3748119
[21:13:08] <gloomer> what are you trying to accomplish sqwk
[21:15:00] <cheesypoof20> I just finished writing a chain selected script: http://jsfiddle.net/8ZbUR/9/ I am employing server-side validation for the form. All 3 fields are required, so if for example a user only inputs values for 2 of the 3 fields, they will receive an error message placed above the form.
[21:16:12] <cheesypoof20> Basically the problem is that after the page reload on the failure to validate, the first select has the previous value they chose already selected. This is preventing the .load from functioning unless they switch to a different value first.

[21:38:40] <cheesypoof20> Nevermind, I decided to remove the first select's options from the html and make jquery append the options instead. Fixed the problem.
[21:55:54] <cheesypoof20> $("#model").load("/store/" + this.value + "/", function() {$(this).removeAttr("disabled");});
[21:56:25] <cheesypoof20> How could I target only the "#list option" elements in this?
[22:03:27] <_zoggy_> anyone else see the anchor button off compared to the other buttons on : http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#default ? (due to overflow: hidden)

[22:29:22] <_zoggy_> so why doesnt jquery use a css reset like normalize.css to split up the need for overly verbose css ?
[22:29:51] <tw2113> jquery uses css?

[23:42:45] <sqwk> How can I access the query slider within its options object? Trying something like this: http://pastie.org/3748119
[23:48:35] <sharkmonkey> Is it possible to process part of an ajax request response before it finishes?
[23:50:09] <gloomer> sharkmonkey might be easier to split it into multiple request/responses
[23:52:16] <sharkmonkey> I guess I could do that instead
