[00:02:10] <shoky> aqeel: yes, exactly what i wrote
[00:03:08] <aqeel> ok lets see....thanks
[00:04:42] <aqeel> thanks shocky that worked...
[00:05:18] <aqeel> but why was it like that, can't i write that in if condition....maybe jslint?
[00:05:37] <shoky> you're using jslint, and then asking.. why?
[00:05:41] <shoky> what's the point of that?
[00:06:06] <shoky> i'm sure you can read about all of jslin't suggestions on the web
[00:06:11] <shoky> jslint's
[00:06:29] <shoky> anyway, what's not clear here
[00:06:33] <shoky> if (a = b) { ... }
[00:06:37] <shoky> is much less clear then:
[00:06:42] <shoky> a = b;  if (a) { ... }
[00:07:21] <shoky> and jslint is all for clarity
[00:09:25] <aqeel> no i want to confirm was it because of jslint or is it wrong by writing the line like that?
[00:11:04] <aqeel> shoky: thanks for your clarification
[00:27:51] <warden23> Hello could someone please help me.. if you load my website in FF and Chrome it loads fine but in IE9: http://www.toggleway.com.au/pre-release/tikraionline/index.php/products in debug window says: SCRIPT438: Object doesn't support property or method 'undefined'
[00:27:52] <warden23> module.js.php?v=1, line 82 character 3
[00:28:01] <warden23> Which is: return jQuery.easing[jQuery.easing.def](x, t, b, c, d);
[00:28:21] <warden23> Would this be caused by a conflict with another jquery script?
[00:31:11] <warden23> if so, what would I change that line of code to?
[00:32:26] <Sgeo|web_> Suppose I have a select list with options generated at runtime, values made with user input. I want to remove some of the options at runtime too. I want to be able to use .remove(), but I don't want to make a selector with string concatenation for fear of XSS.
[00:32:49] <Sgeo|web_> Is there a way to dynamically make a selector, or otherwise find and remove the element named by a value?
[00:34:28] <DrDank> Any way to use form validation while the form is in a seperate div??
[00:36:02] <Sgeo|web_> I guess I can loop each element inside the select, and delete the relevent ones.. wait, I don't see how to do that with remove, hmm
[00:36:44] <Sgeo|web_> Oh, n/m
[00:36:51] <Sgeo|web_> Thought that .remove() had to take a selector
[00:46:06] <Sgeo|web_> Hmm, not quite working as I had hoped
[00:46:22] <warden23> Someone want $ to fix it? :P
[00:46:47] <Sgeo|web_> No
[00:47:34] <tw2113> no surprise in something not working in IE
[00:47:36] <Sgeo|web_> The distinction between this and $(this) does confuse me a bit, as does why each would supply its callback with the element when that seems to be unused
[00:47:56] <Sgeo|web_> Erm, not sure when it would be used, I mean. Is it the same as this?
[00:48:07] <warden23> yeah but like 50% adverage joes prob still use IE
[00:48:10] <warden23> so can't just ignore it lol
[00:48:23] <warden23> no idea why when IE is just bad
[00:48:38] <warden23> Compared to FF and Chrome
[00:48:53] <warden23> maybe IE 10 or something will be decent
[00:48:58] <Sgeo|web_> The app is intended for mobile devices. Also, currently not particularly thinking about this thing seeing public usage (there are some security flaws that require an architectural change to fix)
[00:48:58] <tw2113> microsoft in an eternal loop of catchup
[00:49:18] <Sgeo|web_> Still no reason to write in XSS flaws though
[00:50:08] <warden23> They have enough $$ to catchup
[00:50:38] <warden23> but they prob have shares in mac so u know.. ;)
[00:50:40] <tw2113> it's not a case of money, it's a case of time and effort
[00:51:12] <warden23> how hard could it be with professional programers if someone like FF who has a smaller employee pool can pull it off
[00:51:30] <tw2113> and it's not like firefox/opera/chrome/safari are stangant, they're still moving
[00:51:37] <warden23> You would think Microsoft would employ the best
[00:51:55] <tw2113> it's hard to overcome a moving target with a decent head start
[00:52:14] <warden23> Microsoft has had more time lol
[00:52:30] <tw2113> wasted time, see how long IE6 was mostly stagnant
[00:53:01] <warden23> true
[00:53:03] <tw2113> i've heard IE10 is decent
[00:53:08] <tw2113> all things considered
[00:53:28] <tw2113> IE version isn't their biggest issue right now, OS version is
[00:53:44] <tw2113> they can't get people off of XP and they don't push their newest to it
[00:53:51] <warden23> IE is my biggest issue right now ;)
[00:54:17] <tw2113> XP is still the most popular and it tops at IE8
[00:55:15] <warden23> :|
[00:55:21] <Sgeo|web_> o.O lol my code looks like it's working but it keeps hitting "maximum call size exceeded"
[01:00:13] <Sgeo|web_> ...at least I knew why that error was happening and fully expected something alone those lines.
[01:00:23] <Sgeo|web_> Now I'm getting unnamed errors without the faintest idea why
[01:00:40] <Sgeo|web_> ...I think no one wants to hear me chat while I develop
[01:01:02] <warden23> ;)
[01:01:21] <warden23> can have an old php effect if jquery scripts work?
[01:01:25] <warden23> having*
[01:04:04] <Sgeo|web_> Pretty much all relevant server-side components are handled by a third-party service.
[01:04:09] <Sgeo|web_> (PubNub)
[01:04:35] <Sgeo|web_> Although currently I'm messing more with the Google Maps part of the equation than jQuery stuff

[03:03:05] <vladyn_> is there a reserved word for that ?
[03:03:55] <vladyn_> oh - $().jquery; is probably what I'm looking for
[03:18:52] <warden23> G'day how do I make this noconflict?

[03:20:37] <warden23> i know how to do the top part into no conflict but im unsure how to do the bottom half?
[03:26:46] <warden23> :(
[03:35:03] <warden23> jQuery(document).ready(function($) { does this put it in noconflict mode?
[03:36:18] <warden23> 771 people and no help :D lol GG
[03:44:23] <MeMReS> Well i could refer you to Vanilla JS but i fear that wouldn't be helpful either..
[03:46:53] <NodeX> warden23 : jQuery.noConflict() does the mode you're after
[03:47:16] <NodeX> function($) just isolates the dollar for that scope

[07:09:46] <Abhijit> hello. how can i insert jquery inside .phtml file
[07:09:48] <Abhijit> help please
[07:39:45] <tsang> I am using sortable interactions of jquery-ui.How could i get the sequence of the list after i draged them?
[08:00:39] <Abhijit> hi guys. this is my code. http://paste.ubuntu.com/1419098/ it do not do anything. help please
[08:01:40] <Already> you're missing a </script> at least
[08:01:48] <Already> What's it supposed to do?
[08:02:16] <Already> Does "as.php" work? What kind of error do you get?
[08:02:39] <Already> oh and you shouldn't use alert, instead you console.log("msg")
[08:03:45] <Abhijit> no i missed it in pastebin only
[08:03:47] <Abhijit> it is there
[08:03:52] <Abhijit> yes as.php adn json.php works
[08:06:44] <Already> Do you get any kind of error? What's the definition of getOutput? Do you get a general JS error? What's the output of e.g. Firebug? Are those ressources loaded correctly?
[08:07:32] <Abhijit> Already, i removed the getoutput it was not there. i get no error
[08:07:58] <Abhijit> Already, this is my json.php http://paste.ubuntu.com/1419101/ and this is as.php http://paste.ubuntu.com/1419099/ and form.phtml as form method as post
[08:08:23] <Already> What's the output of your "debug string"? What kind of status do you get?
[08:09:10] <Already> your json.php outputs malformed json
[08:09:32] <Already> AFAIK you can't have any output besides the json. So you can't have the print_r
[08:10:02] <Already> oh sorry
[08:10:14] <Abhijit> :-o
[08:10:26] <Already> i got you wrong on that.  It's only the "input" json.
[08:10:43] <Abhijit> Already, how can i pass the argument to json.php from address bar of webbrowser to test?
[08:10:48] <Abhijit> yes
[08:11:12] <Already> by just using get parameters
[08:11:26] <Abhijit> i mean whats the syntax?
[08:12:27] <Already> Is only the json.php not working? So the .load for as.php works?
[08:12:53] <Abhijit> Already, both are working
[08:13:04] <Already> It's as usual json.php?param1=value1&param2=value2
[08:13:19] <Abhijit> i dont have .load in as.php
[08:13:19] <Already> So what's your problem? (I was talking about the jquery code)
[08:13:52] <Already> I was talking about your jquery code. :)
[08:14:20] <Abhijit> as.php and json.php are working its the jquery who do not work. even if i remove all the code and just put alert(it is working) on button click then also it dont work
[08:16:16] <Already> In that case there's some broken code elesewhere on your site or you have disabled javascript in your browser. At least those are my guesses. Did you have a look at your browers javascript console and what it's telling you that is broken?
[08:18:49] <Abhijit> Already, i am getting this error in firebug TypeError: element.dispatchEvent is not a function[Break On This Error] 	element.dispatchEvent(event);
[08:19:43] <defaultro> hey folks, we have a form and there is a scrollbar. Since we keep the form open when we submit, I would like it to go to the topmost part of the form again after I hit submit. How do I do that?
[08:21:25] <Already> Abhijit try using var $j=jQuery.noConflict(); before document.ready as it looks like you're using some other library. maybe that's causing the issue as it's trying to call $(document).ready for that other lib.
[08:21:40] <Already> and ofc change $(document) to $j(document)
[08:21:45] <Abhijit> i am doing taht doo i have added $j
[08:21:50] <Abhijit> yes changed $ to $j
[08:24:34] <Already> Still you're calling noConflict AFTER you try to call something that's already jquery related.
[08:24:55] <Abhijit> ok changed
[08:24:58] <Abhijit> and still not working
[08:26:22] <Already> So could you post again how your jquey code looks?
[08:28:17] <Abhijit> Already, this is how i am calling json.php  $.post("http://localhost/magentonew/json.php",{txtname="Mridul"},function(data,status){}); and thsi is my jsob.php http://paste.ubuntu.com/1419101/
[08:28:24] <Abhijit> Already, my form method is post
[08:29:05] <Abhijit> Already, please help.
[08:29:47] <Already> It's not about how you call json.php. It's about how you setup jquery. Your browser already told you that something is _really_ broken. Probably because you're using some other lib as well. Like prototype, mootools or whatever.
[08:30:04] <Abhijit> yes
[08:30:10] <Already> How does the code you posted here look right now? http://paste.ubuntu.com/1419098/
[08:30:25] <Abhijit> Already, the i am doing this inside magento and magento is using prototype. but i have enabled jquery inside magento and i am using $j everywhere
[08:31:08] <Already> Not int the code you pasted right there. The ready function isn't using $j it's still using $
[08:31:14] <Abhijit> Already, it looks like this http://paste.ubuntu.com/1419152/
[08:31:28] <Abhijit> Already, yes its in another file outside magento just to test jquery
[08:31:38] <Abhijit> thats why its not using $J
[08:36:01] <Already> So if you but a console.log("jquery loaded) within the ready function it should show up, as far as i can tell. Now maybe there's no button it's being bound to?
[08:36:24] <Abhijit> Already, there is <button in that form.phtml where i have added this script code
[08:36:30] <Abhijit> let me change to console.log
[08:36:50] <Abhijit> console.log("IT WORKS!"); is this correct?
[08:37:04] <Already> oh and it should be {txtname:msg} instead of {txtname=msg}
[08:37:06] <Already> yes
[08:37:33] <Already> http://jsbin.com/esofuz/1/edit
[08:38:29] <Abhijit> i get string IT WORKS! at console in firebut. that means jquery is working? right?
[08:39:24] <Abhijit> Already, ok i dont know how but it is working now and it successfully written data to file
[08:39:26] <Already> If you even can see the "IT WORKS" it means at least the click method is being called
[08:39:32] <Abhijit> but i am now not getting the data in frontend
[08:39:49] <Abhijit> click method is also calling and the ajax call and then the both php file also working
[08:40:05] <Abhijit> but still nothing in frontend let me check frontend js code just a mooment
[08:40:28] <Teduardo> Howdy, does anyone know of a safe way to alert the user if they pick a credit card expiration date in the past like 01/2012?
[08:42:13] <geoffl> how can i use the get method to return only specific content from another page?
[08:42:25] <kripster> could someone help me with a very simple jquery issue i am having
[08:42:29] <kripster> go here http://jsfiddle.net/Sjfs8/6/
[08:43:30] <kreantos> hi, is there a plugin for file downloads with progress notification?
[08:43:58] <kripster> how do i add the radio button name to the header of the collapsible
[08:44:22] <Already> geoffl i don't think that's what .get is meant for http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[08:44:39] <kripster> any ideas?
[08:45:04] <geoffl> @Already, any suggestions on another method that would work?
[08:45:47] <kripster> on the click of the radio button how do i add the name of that radio button to the header <h1>?? http://jsfiddle.net/Sjfs8/6/
[08:46:20] <Already> Just have the script output only the bits you need
[08:47:27] <kripster> anyone?
[08:48:38] <Already> easiest thing i can think of geoffl. though probably not what you wanna do? I'm not sure maybe .get supported getting only an id of a page ... or mabye it was another function
[08:51:19] <geoffl> Already, i'm using a callback function. is it possible to call .find() on the returned data and only get the specific content?
[08:52:11] <kripster> is there a way to a the name of the radio button as the variable and then add that variable to the header for display?
[08:54:23] <kripster> sorry for probably what is a simple question, am a newbie
[08:55:50] <geoffl> kripster, $('#headerID').html('some value');
[08:56:24] <Abhijit> Already, this is my frontend java code. http://paste.ubuntu.com/1419207/ it works only if there are total 5 elements in the array in that file "ALREADY". if there are less elements in array in that file and if i add something to array later on then it do not works.
[08:56:45] <Abhijit> js code i mean
[08:59:08] <kripster> this is confusingm e, geoff how do i add the name of the radio button to the header :http://jsfiddle.net/Sjfs8/6/
[09:02:45] <kripster> so for example i click on frank radio button the header will say my name is: frank (http://jsfiddle.net/Sjfs8/6/)
[09:04:07] <shoky> geoffl: example-  $.get('url').done(function(data) {  $('<div>').append(data).find('#element').appendTo('#container') });
[09:04:34] <shoky> you can also use $('#element').load('url #element')
[09:05:03] <shoky> i mean $('#container').load('url #element')
[09:08:18] <kripster> anyone help with this very simple issue??
[09:12:25] <kripster> anyone?
[09:12:46] <Already> Abhijit you're only calling getJson once. So there's no way it could update by just that snipped but why it's only working when you have ecatly 5 entries? idk. Maybe it's related to the way your output of asd.txt is organized.
[09:13:14] <Abhijit> Already, it works when it has 5 entries
[09:13:27] <kripster> so for example i click on frank radio button the header will say my name is: frank (http://jsfiddle.net/Sjfs8/6/)??
[09:13:50] <Teduardo> anybody know why this doesn't do anything =D ? http://jsfiddle.net/Vvf5P/
[09:15:08] <Already> As i said i don't know why it's only working when there are 5 entries. I can't see any reason for that. But once that page is open you'll only get the output once, even if you're calling display every 1.5 seconds.
[09:16:16] <Already> Again i'd say fire up Firebug and have a look. You'll run into a boundary exception for sure as you'll keep incrementing your index variable every 1.5 seconds regardless of the size of the array.
[09:18:47] <shoky> kripster: example- http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Sjfs8/10/
[09:19:50] <kripster> legend shoky thx
[09:20:28] <shoky> there's prolly a nicer jqm way to get the radio's text tho
[09:20:31] <shoky> dono
[09:21:11] <Harmageddon> kripster: http://dpaste.org/52QSw/
[09:21:32] <Harmageddon> not tested, try it ;)
[09:22:01] <shoky> oh just .text() works too, sweet. tho scary
[09:22:21] <shoky> doesnt work for writing tho ;D
[09:22:34] <kripster> cheers guys
[09:28:48] <kripster> is there anyway to on the click of collapse let it expand and collapse like an accordian instead of trigger (http://jsfiddle.net/Sjfs8/14/)??
[09:30:55] <kripster> it works at the moment but would prefer it to look like an accordian affect
[09:34:13] <Harmageddon> maybe you should try $('#expand').accordion('activate', 0); instead of trigger?
[09:36:25] <kripster> that doesnt work harmageddon
[09:38:55] <Harmageddon> how about trigger('collapse', 'youreffect');?
[09:39:44] <Harmageddon> or trigger('collapse', ['youreffect', {further options}])
[09:43:05] <kripster> any ideas how to expand collapse this like an accordian style? http://jsfiddle.net/Sjfs8/14/
[09:45:31] <kripster> any ideas?
[09:45:47] <shoky> kripster: stop that
[09:47:52] <kripster> stop what, just looking for some help
[09:48:19] <shoky> asking a question and a minute later going 'anyone?!?!?!'
[09:48:44] <shoky> once is fine.. now you're just becoming a nag

[09:50:38] <kripster> nah its cool, just a new to jquery so trying to understand it better
[09:50:46] <shoky> DrDank: no idea what validationEngine is or simpleModal .. sorry
[09:58:36] <kripster> so no ideas on the accordian thingy lol

[10:05:48] <ngharo> craea: butshow isnt a descendant of divshow.  closest never finds it
[10:10:07] <craea> http://jsfiddle.net/xBqms/1/ <- how about this.. its simplier but still didnt work >_>
[10:10:49] <Waldir> $("<div><p>a</p></div>").html() returns "<p>a</p>", as expected, but $("<div><p>a</p></div>").remove("p").html() returns exactly the same. Shouldn't it return "" instead?
[10:11:17] <shoky> Waldir: remove is called on the element being removed
[10:11:21] <ngharo> craea: now you have the opposite problem.
[10:11:51] <ngharo> find is searching for descendants of this
[10:12:24] <Waldir> shoky: the docs say: "We can also include a selector as an optional parameter. For example, we could rewrite the previous DOM removal code [which was $('.hello').remove(); ] as follows:  $('div').remove('.hello');"
[10:12:43] <shoky> Waldir:  that removes the 'div'
[10:12:48] <shoky> Waldir: the selector is only a filter
[10:12:58] <shoky> Waldir: removes all divs with class .hello
[10:13:06] <shoky> Waldir:  var d = $("<div><p>a</p></div>"); d.find('p').remove(); d.html();
[10:13:32] <Waldir> shoky: damn, I misread the docs :/
[10:14:27] <Waldir> shoky: thanks
[10:14:28] <shoky> s'ok, at least you read em ;]
[10:14:33] <Waldir> :)
[10:33:47] <Waldir> shoky: could you please take a look at http://waldir.github.com/minipedia/ ? after you click "load random", the contents of the red-bordered div should not contain a table
[10:34:12] <Waldir>  (if the first article you get doesn't contain a table, try loading another one)
[10:34:49] <Waldir> shoky: table removal should happen here: https://github.com/waldir/minipedia/blob/gh-pages/minipedia.js#L32

[11:39:58] <aqeel> its stated in plugin
[11:41:38] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/tMUq5/
[11:42:47] <aqeel> BinaryKitten:  please see the fiddle...
[11:43:26] <BinaryKitten> aqeel which plugin?
[11:43:37] <aqeel> spin.js
[11:44:17] <aqeel> BinaryKitten: http://fgnass.github.com/spin.js/
[11:44:22] <BinaryKitten> ok
[11:44:36] <BinaryKitten> so if that's in a plugin, then you need to raise the issue with the plugin author
[11:45:29] <aqeel> but if someone can explain the line code would be of great help
[11:46:02] <aqeel> ~~ what is the purpose of this in the line?

[12:21:31] <civilordergone> hi, when i'm trying to call an ajax post, it works fine on my local machine but on the server it breaks.
[12:38:53] <rindolf> Hi all. What's a good way to minify HTML for output in JavaScript?
[12:39:07] <rindolf> Using jQuery or whatever?
[12:40:42] <rindolf> I thought of a JSON or HAML-like encoding.
[12:41:43] <grafi> tell me when you found one :o
[12:42:07] <delinquentme> Ok so i've got this interesting issue where I'm opening a .js file in rails ... and I've got it setup... but I cant get output from console.log() .... however alert() works?  ideas?
[12:44:53] <systemfault> Is your console even opened?
[12:45:11] <delinquentme> systemfault, yes
[12:46:14] <delinquentme> systemfault, this is the google chrome console
[12:46:22] <systemfault> Strange :/
[12:52:52] <tw2113> gseguin, your auto away is annoying
[13:07:53] <sorressean> I'm looking at an example that does jQuery(document).ready(...). can you just do $(document).ready(...)?
[13:11:19] <systemfault> Sure...
[13:11:24] <systemfault> jQuery = $
[13:11:34] <systemfault> $ is just a shorthand
[13:12:27] <systemfault> Also.. the .ready syntax itself has a shorthand: $(function() {  EverythingHereWillBeCalledOnReady();  })
[13:13:28] <sorressean> o, sweet. thanks
[13:18:01] <sorressean> I have one more question... I'm trying to make sections of my site collapsable to hide menues that don't need to be there. is there a good example of this that doesn't require a plugin? I'm blind, so I'm not sure what it looks like, but from what I have been able to figure out, there's an arrow to show that you can expand/collapse something.
[13:20:32] <Nivery> when using fancybox, the content is going away on the original page when i close the opened fancybox
[13:20:42] <Nivery> not sure why it would do that
[13:48:04] <casualCoder> Anyone bored enough to help a n00b with a jQuery validation plugin usage question?
[13:48:54] <shoky> casualCoder: ask
[13:49:00] <casualCoder> Got a sign-up page, bunch o' fields, split out into steps which are just divs switching between display=block/none.
[13:49:20] <casualCoder> I want to validate the required fields for each step, as I go .. not all at once.
[13:49:37] <casualCoder> Only just looked at jQuery.validate and see the initial/easiest usage is by validating the form..
[13:49:58] <casualCoder> So would the most straight-forward solution be to dynamically add 'required' classes as I go?
[13:53:14] <coldhead> no that won't work
[13:53:35] <coldhead> you'd have to re-init the validator everytime you added a required class
[13:53:42] <casualCoder> Right.  I was thinking that $("#form").validate may enqueue the fields to validate when you call it, so wouldn't work.
[13:53:46] <casualCoder> Yeah.
[13:54:13] <casualCoder> So maybe I have to group each of the steps' fields into their own form?
[13:54:26] <coldhead> that would work!
[13:54:27] <casualCoder> I'm using ajax so not really submitting each form, it's just for grouping.
[13:54:49] <coldhead> that's a very simple way to fix it, if your usage supports that
[13:55:40] <casualCoder> Heh my usage does, but the page has gotten a little long, so refactoring more forms into it is going to be arduous.
[13:55:51] <casualCoder> That would of course be my *own* fault ;)
[13:56:19] <coldhead> another option would be to do custom validation
[13:56:32] <coldhead> where you provide a function that deteremines whether or not a field is valid
[13:56:41] <coldhead> and let the plugin handle reporting this fact to the user
[13:56:52] <coldhead> which would also be arduous
[14:01:42] <casualCoder> Yeah agreed; the use of classes was the easiest/most tempting option, but it looks like I'll need a little more footwork and logic as the steps proceed.
[14:01:44] <shoky> an example of which can be found here: http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/multipart/
[14:02:07] <shoky> using a custom 'pageRequired' method instead of the normal 'required'
[14:03:16] <d1rkp1tt> Hi Guys, I am trying to get a django  tag recognised in document.ready... when that failed, I reverted to a simple alert("hello anyone") to see if anything would fire. Funnily enough all my other jquery works from document ready, but I cant get a simple alert to fire. No errors in google dev toolbar
[14:03:19] <coldhead> oh thx shoky
[14:04:04] <coldhead> d1rkp1tt: check your script tag, you might have type="text/javscript" or something
[14:04:11] <coldhead> which will fail silently
[14:05:00] <d1rkp1tt> coldhead, and remove it?
[14:05:57] <shoky> d1rkp1tt: i think he meant you might have a typo.. javscript
[14:06:42] <d1rkp1tt> nope I dont have a typo
[14:06:58] <shoky> console.log works?
[14:07:05] <coldhead> wanna show us the code d1rkp1tt ?
[14:07:23] <d1rkp1tt> sure
[14:09:08] <d1rkp1tt> Im new, so theres probably lots of ugly here... ;)
[14:09:09] <d1rkp1tt> http://pastebin.com/N2Dh2sjN
[14:09:33] <d1rkp1tt> and the top of my template
[14:10:11] <d1rkp1tt> http://pastebin.com/wCdc4LQA
[14:11:02] <d1rkp1tt> So.. I pasted the whole lot in case something below document.ready is affecting the alert
[14:11:19] <d1rkp1tt> note...
[14:11:34] <d1rkp1tt> everything works... except for new code that I add to document.ready
[14:11:58] <d1rkp1tt> Its probably not great that I am mixing favascript with jquery... but theres a lot that I couldnt get to work in jquery
[14:13:51] <shoky> and if you put the alert before that  if({{ form2.is_bound }}){
[14:14:07] <d1rkp1tt> doesnt work
[14:14:15] <shoky> anyway, don't use alerts
[14:14:18] <shoky> console.log('hi')
[14:14:21] <shoky> and look at the console
[14:14:37] <d1rkp1tt> the alert is just to test why the code is not working
[14:14:45] <d1rkp1tt> i see
[14:14:46] <d1rkp1tt> ok
[14:15:04] <d1rkp1tt> I took the alert out of the if statement and put it at the top
[14:15:06] <d1rkp1tt> still nothing
[14:15:27] <shoky> what is {{ form2.is_bound }}
[14:15:37] <shoky> and, did you console.log ..
[14:16:04] <d1rkp1tt> form2.is_bound tells me if my form has any data in it
[14:16:10] <d1rkp1tt> where do I see console logs?
[14:16:24] <shoky> in the console
[14:16:50] <d1rkp1tt> im looking in firebug console
[14:16:51] <shoky> ctrl-shift-j
[14:16:52] <d1rkp1tt> nothing
[14:16:53] <coldhead> that code really looks okay, do you have this live somewhere?
[14:17:00] <d1rkp1tt> its in dev
[14:17:23] <shoky> also what's this.toggle2
[14:17:27] <coldhead> are you sure the file is being loaded?
[14:17:33] <d1rkp1tt> toggle2 shows and hides a div
[14:17:41] <coldhead> can you see it with a 200 OK status in the network tab of your debugger?
[14:17:57] <d1rkp1tt> ALL other javascript loads
[14:18:18] <d1rkp1tt> Console.log is empty
[14:18:24] <d1rkp1tt> bizare
[14:19:09] <shoky> you're doing this.toggle2  where this === document
[14:19:13] <shoky> so.. document.toggle2(..)
[14:19:15] <shoky> ?
[14:19:45] <shoky> weird shite
[14:20:46] <d1rkp1tt> shoky, I just tried the "this"
[14:20:51] <d1rkp1tt> because it wasnt working.
[14:20:59] <d1rkp1tt> I see...
[14:21:27] <shoky> no errors at all in your console..?
[14:21:47] <d1rkp1tt> actualy, yes errors.. but only css
[14:21:56] <d1rkp1tt> My console.log is not logging..
[14:22:10] <shoky> even if you put it as first line in the docuemnt ready handler?
[14:22:44] <d1rkp1tt> is it case sensitive?
[14:22:49] <d1rkp1tt> e.g. Console.log
[14:23:20] <shoky> javascript is case-sensitive
[14:24:22] <d1rkp1tt> Ahah.. firefox gives me logs.. invalid property id on form.is_bound
[14:24:45] <shoky> :\
[14:27:11] <shoky> don't use templating shit in your javascript, except mayyyybe once for initializing some variables... e.g.  var form2Bound = {{form2.is_bound}};  or whatever
[14:27:37] <d1rkp1tt> still no console log though   $(document).ready(function(){
[14:27:37] <d1rkp1tt>     console.log('Check if this is working');
[14:27:48] <shoky> fix the errors
[14:28:18] <d1rkp1tt> shoky, thanks
[14:29:18] <d1rkp1tt> well if I remove that block
[14:29:27] <d1rkp1tt> I should still get a console log
[14:29:53] <shoky> if you fix all errors, and still don't get a console log, then we got smth to talk about ;p
[14:32:13] <d1rkp1tt> shoky, I removed that code an got logs... thanks for your help.. now I just gotta workout how to check the form is bound...
[14:32:36] <d1rkp1tt> And thats a Django question, thanks again
[14:32:49] <shoky> np

[14:41:30] <code-shah> and then leaves :( durig the modal being shown
[14:43:03] <jrockjiggz> code-shah: there are browser security limitations, i've never seen a dialogue other than the confirm() one when leaving a page
[14:43:52] <code-shah> jrockjiggz:hmm k... I guess what I can do is catch any outgoing a href's and show a modal

[16:49:35] <p0tta> hey guys, I have a quick question about JSONP
[16:49:35] <p0tta> I have a servlet on a different domain which sends me XML data
[16:49:43] <p0tta> can I use JSONP to call the servlet? Or should it only be JSON?
[16:49:55] <p0tta> I think I need to use JSONP because my jQuery page is hosted on a different server as the servlet
[16:59:12] <shoky> p0tta: to use JSONP the server has to be configured for JSONP
[16:59:25] <shoky> server must cooperate
[17:00:56] <dcope> Hey all
[17:01:04] <dcope> Is it possible to manually pass in `this` to a function?
[17:02:39] <systemfault> With .call/.apply
[17:03:48] <dcope> systemfault: hm, docs aren't pulling anything up
[17:04:04] <dcope> systemfault: basically i'd like to manually call a function that i have defined for an event (using on()) :)
[17:04:08] <dcope> is this possible?
[17:04:40] <systemfault> Manually?
[17:05:31] <tw2113> dcope, so you want to not use a new anonymous function with the .on() event handler?
[17:06:27] <dcope> tw2113: so i have a function (editRow) that is used in on(). I want to pass an element to editRow so i can access it with $(this)
[17:06:34] <dcope> that way i can have multiple uses for the function
[17:07:35] <systemfault> dcope: Perhaps $.proxy would do what you want
[17:09:48] <tw2113> i would have thought this would work http://jsbin.com/usupig/1/edit
[17:10:41] <p0tta> shoky: does that mean that the server should send JSON data?
[17:10:43] <Demonen> tw2113: No, appending the () to the function name executes it.
[17:10:44] <p0tta> only?
[17:10:48] <dcope> tw2113: that doesn't work because it actually calls the func
[17:11:02] <dcope> tw2113: i tried that initially :D and that would've been a perfect solution
[17:11:36] <tw2113> ah
[17:11:37] <tw2113> $('#me a').on('click',myFunc);
[17:11:54] <tw2113> remove that () and then it works
[17:11:56] <dcope> tw2113: but then you can't pass a param to myFunc
[17:11:59] <tw2113> resuable function
[17:12:11] <tw2113> doh
[17:12:26] <Demonen> Well, an argument IS passed to it.
[17:12:28] <Demonen> The event.
[17:14:17] <Demonen> http://jsbin.com/usupig/2/  <-- Like so
[17:14:45] <Demonen> Along with setting context in 'this' and everything.
[17:14:45] <R00tk3y> NET SPLIT
[17:14:46] <R00tk3y> LOL
[17:14:52] <Demonen> Shat.
[17:15:14] <R00tk3y> Welcome back kids
[17:15:29] <Demonen> tw2113: Did you get that, or were you split out?
[17:15:38] <dcope> Danielss89: very interesting
[17:15:38] <tw2113> yeah i saw it
[17:16:06] <Demonen> tw2113: In short, jQuery already provides you with all the context you need.
[17:16:29] <tw2113> dcope, is the one with the question
[17:16:36] <tw2113> i just gave an example as my attempt to answer
[17:18:10] <Demonen> Oh, haha, confused me :-P
[17:18:44] <tw2113> it happens
[17:18:47] <Demonen> dcope: http://jsbin.com/usupig/2/  <-- jQuery already gives all the context you need for 'this'
[17:21:19] <R00tk3y> Anyone here know about video encoding?
[17:22:13] <relipse> anyone used turnjs4?
[17:30:30] <sheilablackrose> hi guys how can i say for each row with the classname docs.  this codes get every single row ini the page $('tr').each(function ()
[17:30:58] <systemfault> Learn CSS.. then you will know.
[17:31:39] <dizzyone> .docs tr
[17:32:36] <systemfault> Not really, good try though.
[17:33:05] <dizzyone> oh I read it as each row inside of docs
[17:33:06] <sheilablackrose> is it $('.docs').$('tr').each
[17:33:13] <dizzyone> tr.docs
[17:33:32] <dizzyone> if I understand correctly I guess it's $('tr.docs')
[17:33:44] <sheilablackrose> ok ill give that a try thanks
[17:34:07] <dcope> https://gist.github.com/9340bfcc456c6cbc0820
[17:37:47] <sheilablackrose> thanks that worked
[17:38:23] <systemfault> CSS is your friend ;)
[17:38:32] <Woet> counter-strike source is my best friend.
[17:38:43] <systemfault> :/
[17:38:43] <sheilablackrose> im new to coding
[17:38:52] <systemfault> Ah ok :)
[17:39:44] <sheilablackrose> another question if in each row i have a hidden input field n i want to retrive its value. must i have a classname for it? is there away i can retrive its value from the $('tr.docs').each(function () { ?
[17:40:19] <sheilablackrose> its a dynamicly created row so if i assigned an id to it, each row will have a same id
[17:41:51] <sheilablackrose> i tried using this $('.hiddenDocumentId').attr("value"); but it only returns the first docid for each row
[17:42:28] <shoky> sheilablackrose:  $(this).find('.hiddenDocumentId').val()   probably
[17:42:59] <sheilablackrose> i was trying to add this in it but i didnt know about the find part
[17:43:02] <sheilablackrose> thanks let me test it out
[17:43:16] <systemfault> If you have more than one element with the same ID, you have illegal HTML
[17:43:49] <systemfault> Santa will kill you.
[17:44:03] <sheilablackrose> is same class ok?
[17:44:13] <systemfault> Sure
[17:44:18] <shoky> santa approved
[17:44:20] <sheilablackrose> cuz my tr n documents n the checkboxes are all created dynamicly
[17:44:25] <sheilablackrose> im way over my head hahaha
[17:44:34] <sheilablackrose> lucky i used class
[17:44:39] <sheilablackrose> was about to us id :p
[17:44:44] <sheilablackrose> use
[17:44:57] <shoky> you can also just put this value as a data-XXX attribute on the <tr> for example
[17:45:08] <shoky> no need for the hidden <input> just to store some data related to the row
[17:45:18] <shoky> then you can easily access it with  $(this).data('XXX')
[17:45:30] <sheilablackrose> that sounds good
[17:45:33] <shoky> like.. <tr data-value="this_rows_value">......</tr>
[17:45:35] <sheilablackrose> let me see if i understand it
[17:45:47] <shoky> and then $(this).data('value') will get that value
[17:47:02] <shoky> (of course if this input is used for some form submission, thats a different story)
[17:47:06] <sheilablackrose> in my case it would be <tr data-value="<%: model.docId%>">    than i use $(this).data('value')
[17:47:34] <shoky> looks right
[17:47:39] <sheilablackrose> when do i use "" n when do i use ''? also when do i use value n val()
[17:47:44] <sheilablackrose> thanks a bunch
[17:47:56] <sheilablackrose> now lets c if i can get this dynamic checkbox thing working
[17:48:06] <shoky> "" and '' are personal preference.. no diff between em
[17:48:15] <sheilablackrose> ic
[17:48:27] <shoky> and you use .val() to get the value of input elements
[17:48:52] <sheilablackrose> ic
[17:48:54] <shoky> .data('xxx') to get data-XXX attributes, or other stuff set with .data(..)
[17:49:15] <sheilablackrose> this data thing looks real useful
[17:49:56] <sheilablackrose> oh yeah i read about this two ajax method to post data. one was beginform n the other was actionlink
[17:50:10] <sheilablackrose> the begin form methods reaches my controller but the action link doesnt
[17:50:12] <sheilablackrose> any idea why?
[17:50:13] <shoky> no idea what that is
[17:50:28] <sheilablackrose> thanks
[17:53:12] <sheilablackrose>  boxes = (this).find('input[type=checkbox]');   -- this will get me all teh textboxes in the row right
[17:53:33] <shoky> $(this), yea
[17:53:43] <shoky> .find(':checkbox') should also work
[17:53:48] <sheilablackrose> so than i loop through it with each function
[17:54:04] <shoky> could do that yes
[17:54:22] <sheilablackrose>  row.push($(this).attr('id')); -- how cna i say only for checkbox that is checked?
[17:54:29] <sheilablackrose> can
[17:54:41] <shoky> .find(':checkbox:checked')
[17:54:50] <sheilablackrose> ohhhh
[17:54:53] <sheilablackrose> so i do that before
[17:54:54] <shoky> also,  this.id
[17:55:16] <sheilablackrose> so i dont need to use attr oi can just say this.id  this.value n so on?
[17:55:23] <shoky> well
[17:55:29] <shoky> for id and value, yea ;P
[17:55:36] <shoky> .attr should rarely be used
[17:56:12] <shoky> .prop is also useful for properties like id and value
[17:56:12] <b-ot> shoky, memorised “prop”.
[17:56:15] <shoky> ;s
[17:57:11] <sheilablackrose> ic
[17:57:54] <sheilablackrose> so like in my case im using checkboxes but one of the checkbox has to b an image. so to get whether its checked or not i should get its srv value n c whether its usinig the check image or not right?
[17:57:57] <someprimetime> prop is for boolean values mainly IIRC
[17:58:08] <someprimetime> e.g. selected=selected / checked=checked
[17:58:10] <someprimetime> and so on
[17:58:20] <shoky> nah it's for any property
[17:58:25] <sheilablackrose> sounds more complicated
[17:58:29] <someprimetime> shoky: interesting
[17:58:32] <shoky> $(this).prop('xxx')  is almost the same as this.xxx
[17:58:36] <someprimetime> i've always grabbed vals with attr
[17:58:40] <someprimetime> i'm gonna scope the source
[17:58:45] <someprimetime> curious now
[17:59:00] <shoky> attr is for stuff you get with .getAttribute
[17:59:09] <shoky> prop is for actual fields on the DOM node object
[17:59:15] <shoky> e.g.  someTR.id
[17:59:20] <shoky> generally, at least.
[18:00:03] <shoky> jquery<1.6 didnt do things right, and used attr for many properties or something, and for backwards compatibilty, attr still works with many stuff that should really be accessed as properties
[18:00:25] <shoky> so today attr and prop might work interchangably for some stuff
[18:00:34] <nerdsex> is it possible to read a file or string, and make it a jquery object, and then traverse it like it's the dom
[18:01:16] <sheilablackrose> shoky is there away i can use an image as a checkbox? n get the checked value?
[18:01:45] <shoky> sheilablackrose there are ways, i dont really know.. im sure you can find many examples if you search
[18:02:05] <someprimetime> shoky: cool thanks for explaining
[18:02:15] <sheilablackrose> yup am doing that
[18:03:17] <shoky> nerdsex: yea, $(string)
[18:03:30] <shoky> htmlstring, that is
[18:03:43] <nerdsex> shoky: eh? alright
[18:03:45] <someprimetime> sheilablackrose: yeah it's not too bad to roll your own (i've done it). you basically want to hide all checkboxes and replace them with your span image.. onclick of the span image, change its class and find the closest <input type="checkbox"> and then trigger a change on it
[18:04:28] <nerdsex> Basically I am going to load the contents of an HTML file into a variable. And I'll want to use that variable as if it was the current dom, so i could do $('#div_from_html_file').show()
[18:04:35] <someprimetime> then if you have some sort of javascript disabled you can throw a class on those spans that sets them back to display: block
[18:04:47] <someprimetime> i sometimes do some noscript css rules
[18:06:34] <sheilablackrose> does all my function have to be in document ready? whats the purpose of it?
[18:07:37] <systemfault> sheilablackrose: No, only those accessing the DOM
[18:08:17] <systemfault> sheilablackrose: document ready means that the DOM tree is complete (The whole HTML file has been parsed and nodes were created)
[18:09:38] <systemfault> Images might not be completely loaded at that time
[18:11:19] <sheilablackrose> ic
[18:11:36] <sorressean> Does jquery have the ability to show an arrow for expand/collapsable menues, or do I have to use separate images for those
[18:12:34] <cusco> should check jquery-ui for that
[18:12:47] <cusco> it does have a bunch of icons/artwork
[18:12:55] <sorressean> I've not used jquery much at all, I just want a simple way to hide menues.
[18:13:11] <sheilablackrose> is there somewhere i can paste my code?
[18:13:25] <sheilablackrose> only small section of it
[18:13:28] <tw2113> pastebin.com
[18:14:09] <sheilablackrose> kewl thank you
[18:14:26] <sheilablackrose> yeay i got it to work
[18:16:14] <sheilablackrose> but is this possible? in c# i have an object which is int Id, list<string> flagIds.   is there a way i can create an identical object in jquery? the one i have now gives me an array with concatenation of stirngs. http://pastebin.com/efS30pMm
[18:23:51] <shoky> sheilablackrose: then why are you doing .join(',') ?
[18:24:59] <sheilablackrose> how should i do it?
[18:25:23] <sheilablackrose> jquery is really complicated!!!
[18:25:33] <shoky> i'm not sure what result you want exactly.. but.. wy not:  results[id] = row;  ?
[18:26:49] <sheilablackrose> could i get something like var myobject = { int Id = id; string flagids[] = row;
[18:26:53] <sheilablackrose> something like that
[18:26:54] <sheilablackrose> ?
[18:27:19] <shoky> you dont write types in javascript
[18:27:29] <shoky> var myobject = {Id: id; flagids: row}
[18:27:31] <shoky> oops
[18:27:38] <shoky> var myobject = {Id: id, flagids: row}
[18:28:20] <shoky> anyway..
[18:28:21] <shoky> ?learn
[18:28:21] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[18:28:54] <sheilablackrose> shoky but would it append my flagids as string?
[18:29:07] <shoky> no
[18:29:17] <shoky> dont know which append you're talking about..
[18:30:26] <sheilablackrose> when i say  row.push($(this).attr('id'));    row now is an array of ids correct?
[18:30:47] <shoky> when you say that, it puts a new id into row..
[18:32:11] <sheilablackrose> so now when the codes goes for each checkbox n gets the ids. it pushes it to the variable row. so how does the variable row look? is it like row[0] = 1, row[1] = 2 and so on?
[18:32:48] <shoky> row[0] = 'whatever id the first row had';  row[1] = 'whatever id the 2nd row had';  etc.
[18:33:10] <shoky> sorry, checkbox, not row
[18:33:38] <shoky> you can check with the console.. console.log(row);
[18:33:41] <shoky> ?ftj
[18:33:41] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[18:37:21] <sheilablackrose> shoky so in that case  http://pastebin.com/8tNmpWX2 gives me an array of object with an integer n a list of strings right
[18:42:33] <gus> sheilablackrose: if you're unsure of what your object looks like then just: console.log(results). F12 on your keyboard should open the javascript console for you if you're using FF or Chrome
[18:43:25] <sheilablackrose> gus im doing that now i htink i must have made a mistake it looks more confusing than ever. ill try with a simple variable first
[18:44:04] <gus> { Id: whateverIDis, Flagids: ["someid1", "someid2", ..., "someidN"] }
[18:46:04] <sheilablackrose> gus this is going to sound stupid. i used the console.log(object) ... where do i see the values? it gave me like a super detailed list of stuff ive never seen in my life
[18:46:27] <gus> You have the console open?
[18:46:30] <sheilablackrose> yup
[18:46:50] <sheilablackrose> i clicked on object
[18:47:07] <gus> If you click on object than it should show you all the attributes of that object
[18:47:21] <gus> e.g. Id and Flagids
[18:47:52] <sheilablackrose>     object = { Id: id, Flagids: row };   console.log[object];
[18:47:57] <sheilablackrose> thats what i changed
[18:48:01] <sheilablackrose> than i clicked on object
[18:48:10] <tw2113> (), not []
[18:48:22] <sheilablackrose> ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[18:48:38] <gus> -_- .log is a function
[18:49:08] <sheilablackrose> hahahahaha
[18:49:11] <sheilablackrose> i got i got
[18:49:12] <sheilablackrose> it
[18:49:17] <sheilablackrose> no wnder
[18:49:30] <sheilablackrose> with the [] a whole bunch of stuff came out
[18:50:01] <tw2113> square brackets are for arrays
[18:50:20] <gus> aka objects
[18:50:23] <sheilablackrose> ic
[18:50:35] <sheilablackrose> yes my jquery problem is solved!!!!
[18:50:35] <tw2113> everything is an object in the end gus
[18:50:42] <sheilablackrose> thank you so much guys
[18:51:01] <sheilablackrose> next dilemma ajax. anyone got sugestion on which room i should ask in?
[18:51:09] <tw2113> this one?
[18:51:27] <sheilablackrose> err ajax is part of jquery?
[18:51:44] <tw2113> ?ajax
[18:51:45] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[18:51:55] <sheilablackrose> its diff from the .net one right?
[18:52:07] <shoky> sheilablackrose: ajax has two sides - the browser side, and the server side
[18:52:08] <sheilablackrose> ?ajax
[18:52:08] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[18:52:21] <sheilablackrose> oh this bot is lovely
[18:52:23] <shoky> the browser side is done easily with jquery
[18:52:30] <sheilablackrose> ?ajax.beginform
[18:52:31] <bot-t> sheilablackrose, .ajaxStart() - Register a handler to be called when the first Ajax request begins. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxStart/
[18:52:39] <casualcoder> ?writemyprojectforme
[18:52:40] <bot-t> casualcoder, Couldn't find "writemyprojectforme" in jQuery Docs.
[18:52:40] <casualcoder> :(
[18:53:02] <sheilablackrose> ic
[18:53:30] <sheilablackrose> what is the difference between ajax begin form and ajax action link? im having a problem with it
[18:53:43] <gus> sheilablackrose: ajax is not "part of jquery", jQuery has some wrappers for ajax calls which make it's utilization a bit simpler. but don't think of ajax as some subset of jQuery.
[18:53:51] <shoky> those are not jquery things, they sound like server stuff (.net ?)
[18:54:40] <shoky> ya its microsoft shit
[18:54:42] <BillCriswell> Think of ajax as something Microsoft got really right.
[18:54:52] <sheilablackrose> hahahaha
[18:55:00] <sheilablackrose> well can u see if i made a mistake here http://pastebin.com/YXW7AyHb
[18:58:35] <shoky> sheilablackrose: its not something we can really see from here.
[18:58:55] <shoky> the JS part of that code looks ok.. might wanna add  dataType: 'json'
[18:59:42] <sheilablackrose> what does that do?
[18:59:50] <sheilablackrose> does it convert the results object
[18:59:50] <sheilablackrose> ?
[18:59:53] <shoky> makes sure that the response from the server is parsed as JSON
[19:00:14] <shoky> (if you dont put it then jquery makes a guess. i prefer to make sure)
[19:00:55] <shoky> donno if you really want:   data: Id
[19:01:20] <shoky> that would just add the Id to the end of the url after a ?
[19:01:22] <Guest28576> hey guys, i was hoping someone could help me with a query project i'm doing?
[19:01:28] <Guest28576> *jquery
[19:01:30] <shoky> like..  http://the.url/?TheId
[19:02:00] <sheilablackrose> sorry data: object
[19:02:12] <sheilablackrose> thats the result i got from the rows n checkbox thing
[19:02:13] <sheilablackrose> :p
[19:02:59] <tw2113> what are you needing ajax for with the rows?
[19:03:31] <sheilablackrose> remember the result i got from the object just now?
[19:03:40] <sheilablackrose> im just passing that to the controller
[19:04:32] <Guest28576> okay, so I guess I'll just ask… I have no idea how to use JavaScript or jQuery, so I'm really struggling over here haha...
[19:04:45] <sheilablackrose> yeay im not the only one
[19:05:19] <gus> Guest28576: https://tutsplus.com/course/30-days-to-learn-jquery/
[19:05:24] <Guest28576> for this project I've been given a web page already formatted with CSS and HTML to have two drop down menus, and then two tables at the bottom (one for departure flights, one for returning flights)
[19:05:49] <Guest28576> I've also been given two variables that contain an array of objects with the properties year, month, day, hour, minute, and price
[19:06:06] <Guest28576> I need to figure out how to use the data in those objects to populate the tables at the bottom
[19:06:14] <tw2113> is this a class that's teaching you about all this stuff?
[19:06:33] <Guest28576> yeah, but the professor is not very good at teaching to non-majors, and this is my first experience with programming
[19:06:38] <tw2113> or is this completely out of school and you just got this task handed to you?
[19:06:58] <Guest28576> so he glosses over the info quickly, and I'm having a hard time keeping up haha
[19:07:21] <someprimetime> at least they teach you about deferreds with that tutsplus thing
[19:07:46] <Guest28576> see, I don't have 30 days to learn jQuery, since this project is due on monday
[19:07:50] <someprimetime> 30 days to learn jquery goodluck
[19:07:51] <someprimetime> lol
[19:08:22] <gus> so instead of attempting to learn the stuff on your own via the tremendous amount of resources found online, you join an irc chanel and ask for people to solve your problem?
[19:08:48] <sheilablackrose> gus that a great link thanks
[19:08:49] <Guest28576> dude you have no idea! i've spent the past two days scouring the web
[19:08:56] <Guest28576> I'm at the end of my rope
[19:09:11] <Guest28576> I read like 4 chapters of Eloquent JavaScript and that helped a lot
[19:10:07] <Guest28576> ok, well that question was a bit broad, but I have several more that are a bit more specific, maybe you guys can help
[19:10:09] <shoky> Guest28576: put the page up on http://jsfiddle.net  , put up what you've tried to do so far, and maybe someone will help you progress
[19:10:19] <shoky> ?jsfiddle @ Guest28576
[19:10:19] <bot-t> Guest28576, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[19:10:35] <Guest28576> i'll check that out, thanks
[19:14:06] <Guest28576> ok, this is what i have so far, shoky
[19:14:07] <Guest28576> http://jsfiddle.net/7fNZx/
[19:14:29] <Guest28576> if anyone can push me in the right direction to start populating the lower divs, that would be much appreciated
[19:14:44] <Guest28576> the "No flight chosen" area is the one that i need to be able to push information into
[19:14:54] <Guest28576> I'm just not sure how
[19:15:33] <Guest28576> I don't want an outright answer, like someone earlier implied lol, I just need direction
[19:17:20] <Guest28576> aw I think i broke it again
[19:20:19] <sheilablackrose> guys remember my object that is created in the function after getting the id n checkboxes.  is there away i can put it in a form? is there like a custom type? so that i can use form submit
[19:22:05] <tw2113> functions inside functions Guest28576
[19:54:28] <JZA> hi I keep getting error messages on this script
[19:54:35] <JZA> that the "$" is not a function
[19:58:34] <systemfault> Include jquery on the page then.
[19:58:52] <JZA> systemfault: thats the problem
[19:59:00] <JZA> systemfault: I do and yet it doesnt do much except complain
[19:59:19] <tw2113> make sure it's included first before you try to use it
[19:59:21] <JZA> http://ooo.pastebin.ca/2290760
[19:59:30] <JZA> that is my head
[19:59:43] <JZA> yet it doesnt work. It says $ is not a function
[19:59:51] <tw2113> it's not 404ing?
[19:59:57] <systemfault> JZA: Looks good...
[20:00:02] <tw2113> you could try jQuery(document).ready(function($)
[20:00:18] <JZA> systemfault: yet it doesnt work
[20:00:31] <JZA> I still see an HTML list
[20:01:27] <systemfault> JZA: Is it possible to get a live URL to that page^
[20:01:28] <systemfault> ?
[20:05:57] <talntid> Can someone help me out a bit? http://jsfiddle.net/3XRUZ/2/
[20:06:23] <talntid> The dropdown boxes aren't working as expected. The data is showing the same no matter which one I select... I created a demo on jsfiddle for help
[20:12:29] <casualcoder> coldhead still around?  And/or anyone that's experienced with jQuery.validate?
[20:35:43] <sheilablackrose> is there a custom input type that i can store an object?
[20:41:52] <tw2113> it wouldn't be an input type then, it'd be a storage type
[20:41:53] <ejo> talntid: i think you should probably take move all of that code outside of the alert() statement first, then trace through it and watch what's happening with the values at the time
[20:42:09] <ejo> talntid: use Chrome Dev Tools or Firebug to trace through and I'm sure you'll see what's going wrong
[20:42:50] <ejo> also, note that .live() is deprecated in favor of .on()
[20:43:10] <tw2113> assume a new enough jquery version is used
[20:43:58] <sheilablackrose> storage type? can i submit that in a form?
[20:44:50] <ejo> sheilablackrose: how do you want to refer to the object or store it?  A common technique is just using (for example) a select that shows the 'name' of the object, and a hidden text input that contains the 'id' of the object
[20:45:17] <ejo> ... and then some other code that puts it all together as necessary upon form submit
[20:45:32] <ejo> for instance building the object as JSON and submitting that, if that's what you need
[20:47:26] <ejo> kind of depends what type of object we're talking about... javascript object or what... and what types of properties on it
[20:48:11] <sheilablackrose> well basically i wanted to send my data object with an ajax post. but it doesnt seem to reach the controller so its an routing issue i guess. but the ajaxbegin form method is able to pass data to the controller. so i would have to use that method. so i would like to pass my object when i sumbit th eform
[20:48:13] <sheilablackrose> is that possible
[20:48:14] <sheilablackrose> ?
[20:49:54] <ejo> uh
[20:50:18] <sheilablackrose> well
[20:50:54] <sheilablackrose> my object[] {int id, list string}
[20:52:22] <ejo> i don't want to be a bummer, but... if you know how to do this in javascript, you won't have any trouble at all in jQuery
[20:52:39] <sheilablackrose> basically i got my object n the values in it
[20:52:48] <ejo> ok
[20:52:51] <sheilablackrose> so how can i send it using ajax.beginform
[20:52:55] <ejo> why beginform?
[20:53:04] <ejo> why not just use $.ajax()
[20:53:20] <sheilablackrose> for some reason it doesnt reach my controller r u familiar with mvc?
[20:53:33] <ejo> mvc refers to many things
[20:53:42] <ejo> but yes, i'm familiar with a controller concept
[20:54:00] <ejo> I take it you mean it doesn't arrive at your server as part of the POST request?
[20:54:26] <sheilablackrose> take a look at this the begin form method is able to get to the controller but the other method doesnt
[20:54:27] <sheilablackrose> http://pastebin.com/5R8jejLc
[20:55:05] <ejo> ok so that's the BeginForm you're referring to... i don't know where that comes from, isn't part of jQuery as far as I know
[20:55:20] <ejo> wait, php?
[20:55:37] <ejo> hmm no
[20:55:53] <tw2113> asp.net if i recall
[20:55:56] <sheilablackrose> c#
[20:55:59] <sheilablackrose> yup
[20:55:59] <ejo> ahh ok
[20:56:12] <ejo> sorry, i'll have to step aside for that
[20:56:43] <sheilablackrose> :) thanks for trying
[20:57:49] <tw2113> is jquery getting used at all, or just javascript? i wonder if this is the wrong support room :P
[20:58:46] <casualcoder> haha @ having one of those moments where I think I got a jQuery plugin working .. but I don't fully understand *how*.
[20:58:56] <tw2113> but i have even less experience with asp.net, and it's all from like 2006
[20:59:20] <digitalmediaguy> Hello jquery friends… I am trying to figure out how change the color of any text on the page that matches a keyword… any thoughts on how this could be done?
[21:00:08] <gus> digitalmediaguy: like ctrl+f ?
[21:00:19] <digitalmediaguy> So… basically scan a paragraph tag for a keyword… and if it matches the keyword… then surround it with a span and change it;s color
[21:00:39] <sheilablackrose> i think so
[21:00:45] <ejo> that's not difficult, digitalmediaguy ... where are you stuck
[21:00:45] <sheilablackrose> but im asking everywhere trying my luck
[21:00:46] <sheilablackrose> :)
[21:01:31] <digitalmediaguy> gus: Yeah… kinda… but in jquery… and then have it turn any resuly it finds a different color
[21:03:29] <digitalmediaguy> something with .find and .css maybe?
[21:03:40] <ejo> really not a difficult task
[21:03:45] <ejo> what have you tried and where did you get stuck
[21:03:56] <tw2113> i tink the trick is going to be isolating the individual words, personally
[21:04:59] <ejo> 1. grab the paragraph element 2. regex or plain old javascript search for keyword and establish its position in the text, segment the paragraph text into before, during, and after the keyword  3. insert new span tags 4. select the span and css it
[21:06:07] <digitalmediaguy> I have a few cases… so basically I need to find the exact phrases "10% OFF" and "10% off" and wrap all cases with a span… then turn it orange….
[21:06:14] <ejo> the jQuery steps in that are the easy ones, the real work is in javascript in step 2
[21:12:27] <casualcoder> digitalmediaguy / all: Sorry if this does nothing but increase my n00b-karma, but would it be something like $(document).text().replace('10% off', '<span class="deal">10% off</span>');
[21:12:42] <casualcoder> Or heh, $().text() ..
[21:15:52] <casualcoder> Could someone possibly tell me how the jQuery validate setup works in this example, specifically how the mathod 'pageRequire' delineates only the fields on the specific pages?

[21:16:25] <casualcoder> (heh sorry for the bad copy/paste, but you get it)
[21:17:10] <casualcoder> I understand that it's trying to keep up with the wizard-page 'steps', but I don't understand why the if-test checks for matching against any of the steps..
[21:18:22] <JZA> hi perhaps someone can help me recomending me a good plugin for what I want to have. I am looking for a plugin that allows me to have a slider where I can dynamically select the distance between each click
[21:18:59] <JZA> example: on click = child element + 200px to the left
[21:19:19] <JZA> I want to have a sliding menu
[21:20:04] <casualcoder> You mean you want to render the menu at click.x - 200px?
[21:20:38] <JZA> since this is a wordpress category list really, I this menu could grow dinamically, (if the user add more categories). The idea is that a sliding will provide a fix with on the page design regardless of the amount of categories.
[21:21:28] <JZA> casual coder, I guess I could provide an example, but it will take a bit to code :)

[21:21:37] <Abhijit> hi guys
[21:21:38] <X1N> early design concept
[21:21:48] <Abhijit> i am using jquery no conflict mode but still it conflicts with prototype
[21:21:49] <Abhijit> help please
[21:21:53] <Abhijit> i done $j
[21:21:57] <Abhijit> its really frustrating
[21:21:58] <JZA> casualcoder: maybe a screenshot
[21:23:00] <casualcoder> You're suggesting maybe you give me a screenshot of your idea .. or you're asking for a screenshot of my question from before?
[21:25:09] <JZA> casualcoder: something like this http://imagebin.org/238607
[21:25:43] <JZA> is a menu, not a gallery, most gallery plugins havent really work for me, they focus on one image at a time.
[21:26:21] <JZA> as you see, I need more like 4 or more elemnts at a time, and when you click another 4 come through
[21:26:21] <casualcoder> Ah .. ok.
[21:26:46] <casualcoder> I think I understand what you *need*, but I don't understand how your original description describes that.  Heheh.
[21:27:42] <JZA> well the way I have it set up, is with a div on top of another menu DIV, as some sort of mask
[21:27:53] <casualcoder> So you essentially want a series of categories (name / picture?), showing 4 at a time, with left and right buttons on their respective sides, and the user clicks each of them to scroll either way?
[21:28:07] <JZA> correct
[21:28:14] <casualcoder> Ah, gotcha.
[21:28:17] <casualcoder> I have no idea.
[21:28:34] <JZA> :(
[21:28:43] <casualcoder> Heheh, don't mean to tease.  I understand the intention, at least.
[21:28:52] <casualcoder> I'm still on my jQuery honeymoon myself.
[21:29:01] <Abhijit> is this recommended or not? <script type="text/javascript">	var $j=jQuery.noConflict();</script>
[21:29:07] <Abhijit> and then use $j everywhere?
[21:29:10] <casualcoder> So when you say 'plugin', you mean a jQuery UI plugin .. not a WordPress/PHP plugin, right?
[21:29:14] <JZA> casualcoder: well I am new to JQuery.
[21:29:22] <Abhijit> this page has downvoted people who have recommened this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1391950/how-to-use-jquery-non-conflict-properly
[21:29:24] <JZA> casualcoder: correct
[21:29:24] <shoky> Abhijit: that's fine
[21:29:50] <JZA> casualcoder: althought if a wordpress plugin can do this, I am all for it. currently I have it on CSS using overflow-y: scroll
[21:30:11] <Abhijit> shoky, i am doing that and using $j everwhere and still i get conflict with prototype that element dispatch event is nota  function
[21:30:12] <JZA> alexandrocolorado.com/wp/
[21:30:12] <shoky> Abhijit: they only downvoted passing in 'true' as argument to noConflict
[21:30:15] <Abhijit> help please
[21:30:19] <Abhijit> ok
[21:30:23] <doctorpepper> hi guys!
[21:30:27] <JZA> casualcoder: http://alexandrocolorado.com/wp/
[21:30:29] <shoky> Abhijit: donno what element dispatch event is..
[21:30:32] <casualcoder> Wehhhll.. A WordPress plugin would still be eventually rendering front-end stuff to display it on the client, so it's gotta be javascript-something in the end.
[21:31:04] <JZA> casualcoder: yeah I guess, I still see many plugins that do something similar, as you can see on my test site
[21:31:38] <Abhijit> shoky, ok
[21:32:45] <shoky> Abhijit: what order are you doing things in
[21:33:05] <Abhijit> shoky, i am incluing jquery noconflict code in head.phtml of my magento site
[21:33:44] <shoky> Abhijit: i dont care what you're doing on the serverside, only whats coming out to the client
[21:33:50] <shoky> and the order is the important thing
[21:33:51] <JZA> casualcoder: I was thinking more like JS straight, plugin those images and serving an 'onclick' event will add an extra pixels to the  left until it reaches the end of the horizontal list
[21:33:52] <doctorpepper> can anyone help please, i have  an issue  with form seralization and json  the issue arise when i  try to serialize  a form  with multiple data record   basically  my field have names that follow the schema  name[index][database field name]
[21:34:24] <Abhijit> shoky, let me check
[21:34:41] <shoky> Abhijit: you should: 1) load jquery 2) call noConflict() 3) include prototype
[21:34:52] <ejo> doctorpepper: say more
[21:34:53] <doctorpepper> when i stringify them  the i get a wrong json format
[21:35:01] <casualcoder> Why's it 'wrong'?
[21:35:09] <casualcoder> s/Why/How/;
[21:35:13] <Abhijit> shoky, ok
[21:35:21] <ejo> doctorpepper: need to pastebin or jsfiddle some examples, some code
[21:35:34] <JZA> ?
[21:35:48] <casualcoder> Yeah, need to see the form/fields how they're related, and the jQuery .ajax call .. if that's where you're putting the serialised stuff.
[21:36:04] <casualcoder> JZA: sounds like a lot of manual work that someone *must* have done before.
[21:36:21] <casualcoder> JZA: I mean you've found things like this already, right?  http://kav.in/wp-ui-for-wordpress/
[21:36:25] <JZA> casualcoder: which is why I wanted to ask if anyone can recomend a plugin :D
[21:37:55] <casualcoder> JZA: even if you don't like what you find on Google, I can't see how writing something from scratch in Javascript would be more productive than using jQuery (in my n00bish experience)
[21:38:39] <JZA> casualcoder: I remember doing something similar in actionscript / flash
[21:38:46] <JZA> so shouldnt be that different
[21:38:48] <casualcoder> So; load all of the categories/images, put them in divs, make 4 visible/the rest hidden, as you click either way, slow-reveal the new one and hide the old one.
[21:39:45] <JZA> casualcoder: exactly
[21:40:11] <casualcoder> Yeah don't go all the way back to Javascript my man.  You might aswell churn your own butter.
[21:40:46] <JZA> casualcoder: if you look at this example, is not so different from what I want
[21:40:48] <JZA> http://www.smartwebby.com/Flash/text_scrollers.asp
[21:41:23] <JZA> only instead of +1 would be more like +20 or +200
[21:44:05] <casualcoder> JZA: I could only do some quick Googling, but check this out for ideas: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/making-a-content-slider-with-jquery-ui/
[21:44:21] <casualcoder> Now I've gotta go be a dilligent boyfriend.  Sheesh.  Girls.  Always getting in the way of good code.
[21:44:27] * casualcoder coder|away
[21:44:44] <JZA> casualcoder: thanks
[21:46:29] <doctorpepper> ejo: http://pastebin.com/XJbFAnbt
[21:47:37] <ejo> ah, i see
[21:47:51] <ejo> doctorpepper: let's see your serialization code.
[21:48:24] <ejo> or are you just using $('form#foo').serializeArray()
[21:49:12] <ejo> In all likelihood I'm going to suggest you write yourself a nice custom serializer function that packages up exactly the JSON you want to send
[21:50:06] <tw2113> to me, it looks like the value spot isn't going deep enough
[21:50:43] <JZA> I think I got it now http://www.gmarwaha.com/jquery/jcarousellite/
[21:50:50] <doctorpepper> ejo: http://pastebin.com/C7rm0k5h
[21:52:15] <ejo> I solved the same problem in my own app recently.  My solution was: structure the form itself, with a hierarchy of divs encoding the objects and their fields.  Instead of relying on form element "name" fields to structure the data
[21:52:30] <Abhijit> i added jquery.noconclifct and still it conflict with prototype
[21:52:33] <Abhijit> help please
[21:52:43] <ejo> doctorpepper: yes, JSON.stringify(form.serialize()) is not going to produce the output you want.
[21:54:36] <ejo> and I suggest you write yourself a custom serializer function, shouldn't be too difficult.
[21:55:09] <ejo> either that, or alter your server-side code to unpack the information as currently submitted... because all the data you need IS in there
[21:55:12] <ejo> just packed funny
[21:55:29] <doctorpepper> i did it with  both serializearray  and serialize   and i have the same
[21:55:34] <ejo> but I don't like the latter approach, I think the multiple id dimensions in strings are wack
[21:55:49] <ejo> doctorpepper: right, i'm saying you aren't going to get what you want with either of those built-ins.
[21:56:00] <doctorpepper> if i post without stringify i work with serialize()
[21:56:41] <doctorpepper> the issue arise  when trying to work  with only json communication
[21:57:57] <ejo> jquery and javascript don't know that your input elements represent a series of objects with particular properties, they just know what they see
[21:58:35] <ejo> if you need to package it up in JSON (javascript object notation) so that it goes over the line to your server as an object, then that's your assignment.
[22:00:20] <rabbi1> has anybody worked with accounting software, need lil help on the process and field involved in it.... or where can i find.?
[22:00:52] <ejo> what's the jQuery aspect of that, rabbi1
[22:01:31] <rabbi1> ejo: i know, just trying my luck if some one's working... kindly ignore
[22:02:22] <ejo> allrighty
[22:06:17] <ejo> doctorpepper: in case you are dynamically generating varying numbers of these records in your forms, like sometimes it's three test results or sometimes it's eleven of them... you could gain a lot from using backbone.js, it's compatible with jquery
[22:07:54] <crab> is there any way to get a jquery-ui 1.9.2 with all the deprecated stuff removed and the compatibility code for jquery < 1.8.x removed?
[22:22:33] <karate> hey guys. can anyone help with a navigation menu issue i'm having?
[22:22:38] <karate> http://jsfiddle.net/karateexplosion6/sttyg/
[22:23:45] <karate> i'm concerned with the //Nav Highlighting section of my script up at the top
[22:24:06] <karate> it's hard to illustrate because it's live on a private network, that requires user name and PW to view
[22:24:39] <karate> but what i'm trying to accomplish is to get the main listings of the Navigation menu to remain highlighted, if you're on a page within that list
[22:24:51] <karate> it works fine, but only if you're on the main page for that menu item
[22:25:14] <karate> i don't know enough javascript to get the sub-menus to highlight the main menu item in the navigation
[22:25:16] <karate> http://jsfiddle.net/karateexplosion6/sttyg/
[22:25:46] <karate> my jsfiddle will just give you a basic idea of what i'm talking about (although the highlighting won't actually work, since it's a private network)
[22:25:51] <karate> any help is appreciated
[22:47:55] <relipse> when the webpage is closing, how do I ask "are you sure you want to close this page?"
[22:48:34] <Cronoh> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=javascript+on+window+close
[22:49:35] <zubelgenubi> hello jquery
[22:49:54] <Cronoh> jquery welcomes you, student
[22:50:21] <zubelgenubi> im developing a jquery mobile site, but I have to turn javascript off to see error messages. Is there something I have set wrong?
[22:50:53] <Abhijit> firebug shows error in line 2 of http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.0/jquery.min.js
[22:50:57] <Abhijit> how can i resolve it?
[22:51:16] <zubelgenubi> I think the messages are outside the data-role='page' div.... maybe thats it
[22:52:45] <JZA> hi I need some help understanding jquery no conflict mode
[22:53:06] <JZA> I am trying to insert this code, but I get errors with the $(function..
[22:54:04] <nerdsex> if i do something like  html = $get.('file.html'), how can extract elements of html?
[22:54:33] <nerdsex> typo there with the .
[22:54:37] <Cronoh> nerdsex you want that file as a string or as html elements
[22:54:57] <nerdsex> set of html elements
[22:55:03] <Cronoh> that you can navigate if so you need to parse it
[22:55:06] <nerdsex> yes
[22:56:26] <Cronoh> i think you can just pass that string to jquery and use like .find() etc
[22:56:32] <Cronoh> from what i'm reading on google
[22:57:20] <Cronoh> ex: $('<html>my html</html>').find('#item1')
[22:57:53] <nerdsex> eh
[22:58:08] <nerdsex> what if in that html strign i have a div with id #test
[22:58:30] <nerdsex> how can i do something like $(html_string).#test.addCss(//
[22:59:32] <nerdsex> I want to take an HTML file, get divs from it (identified with an ID) and inject into the current loaded HTML file. I could use $.load('file.html #divID')
[22:59:39] <nerdsex> but id have to make multiple of those calls
[23:06:17] <ejo> geez, 'karate' couldn't even stick around a half hour for an answer
[23:06:35] <ejo> maybe he realized it was properly a #css question
[23:08:52] <relipse>  can someone login to www.cworklog.com u: test116 p: test116 and tell me how to get those drop down menu buttons smaller it is jqueryui menus
[23:09:23] <Cronoh> u should test yourself :)
[23:12:04] <relipse> Cronoh: i have, it just messes up everything using chrome inspect
[23:21:18] <jtm> I might already be doing this properly, but I am appending to a table <tr></tr> and <td></td> and I want them to fadeIn. So I am doing: $('#posts').append(data).fadeIn('slow');
[23:21:21] <jtm> Does this make sense?
[23:23:10] <Cronoh> yes
[23:23:15] <Cronoh> makes sense to me
[23:23:20] <Cronoh> if its working i dont see any problems
[23:25:19] <jtm> It might be just happening too fast
[23:27:04] <jtm> I set the duration to 10 seconds for the fadeIn, and it's still instant... interesting.
[23:27:06] <nerdsex> what happens when i assign a variable with a dollar sign like $something = '<b>test</b>';
[23:27:15] <nerdsex> as opposed to just 'something'
[23:27:25] <shoky> nerdsex: nothing at all
[23:27:32] <nerdsex> ojh
[23:27:40] <nerdsex> thanks.
[23:27:51] <jtm> Ok I got it, I wasn't appending the hidden rows.
[23:33:48] <Cronoh> fkin love jquery/css, auto clearing of my chat log (Only keeps 10 latest chat messages) : $('div.chat_line:nth-last-of-type(10)').remove();
[23:38:57] <Abhijit> how can i concatenate three string using .concat in one line
[23:39:59] <shoky> str1.concat(str2).concat(str3)  ?
[23:40:09] <Abhijit> ok
[23:47:37] <jtm> What could possibly cause SCRIPT16386: No such interface supported in IE9?
[23:47:48] <jtm> jquery.min.js, line 2 character 75154
[23:47:55] <jtm> Obviously this doesn't help as far as data
[23:48:17] <jtm> I am doing: http://jsfiddle.net/p5DSb/7/
[23:48:29] <jtm> Instead of a click, it's ajaxing in the data.
[23:48:48] <jtm> http://jsfiddle.net/p5DSb/8/  (fixed variables for you all)
[23:49:10] <casualcoder> :/ http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/eu/iewebdevelopment/thread/4e5b181b-66db-40b6-ae38-df7c7bcbdbd4
[23:49:21] <casualcoder> (re: No such interface, etc)
[23:49:25] <jtm> This works perfectly in IE9, but yet when I do it on the success function in production, it simply errors. It'll add 1 element, but there is ~50.
[23:50:09] <casualcoder> You're saying it works on dev but not in production?  Backs up the page I just pasted you.  Could be a DLL registration/version issue.
[23:50:22] <jtm> Hmm
[23:50:39] <jtm> Well it doesn't work in dev either, it works in this jsfiddle example.
[23:50:47] <jtm> I can't see what I am different on my real application.
[23:51:19] <casualcoder> Oh so when you said "This work prefectly in IE9..", you meant the jsFiddle demo.
[23:51:25] <jtm> Also it works in compatibility mode.
[23:51:31] <jtm> yup
[23:51:38] <jtm> The actual site works in compatibility mode, IE7
[23:51:44] <jtm> but in IE9 is gives that error.
[23:51:56] <shoky> jtm: can you pastebin the actual html that you're putting inside $(...)
[23:52:02] <shoky> and then calling .hide() on
[23:52:28] <jtm> Hmm
[23:52:41] <jtm> ill get the text
[23:54:31] <shoky> jtm: also is IE9 running in IE9 standards mode ?
[23:54:39] <shoky> (unrelated to compatibilty mode)
[23:55:00] <shoky> asking about the "Document Mode"
[23:55:09] <shoky> eh nevermind
[23:55:29] <tw2113> stop confusing the new people shoky
[23:55:56] <shoky> they're the ones asking IE questions ;[
[23:58:43] <Abhijit> if my php file is returning data then i use jquery.get and if i have to pass data to php file to process then i juse jquery.post
[23:58:44] <Abhijit> right?
[23:59:20] <casualcoder> Uh.
[23:59:28] <jtm> It's all IE9
[23:59:31] <Abhijit> no?
[23:59:34] <jtm> Document and Compat
[23:59:42] <shoky> Abhijit: those 2 are just shortcuts for jQuery.ajax(..)  with type:'GET' or type:'POST'
[23:59:57] <Abhijit> ok
