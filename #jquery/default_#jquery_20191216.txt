[06:20:50] <znf> what's a "simple" way of manipulating the current URL parameters?
[06:24:14] <bestdesign> znf: what you want exactly?
[06:24:39] <znf> modifying the current browser URL when user does some stuff
[06:58:26] <Cork> znf: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState
[06:58:47] <Cork> or replaceState if you don't want it in the back history
[06:59:43] <znf> hmm, so, state gets serialized as URL parameters?
[06:59:58] <Cork> no, you give it the new url
[07:00:05] <znf> damn it
[07:00:32] <Cork> you can put the params in the url with $.param if you want help with that
[07:00:39] <znf> so I still have to build the URL somehow, that's what I was trying to figure out
[07:00:53] <znf> yeah, but I always have to be aware of what other parameters are in the url
[07:00:56] <Cork> bareurl + $.param()
[07:01:25] <Cork> not really, you can get the current url from window.location
[07:01:46] <znf> ie: for a url like url/?foo=bar&x=y I can't just tell it to replace x=z, I have to keep track of foo=bar, too
[07:02:19] <Cork> well you need something to parse the old window.location.search
[07:02:33] <Cork> but there are a ton of libs out there for that
[07:03:16] <znf> care to point me to a small one that plays nice with jquery? :)
[07:03:32] <Cork> well http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/ for one
[07:03:44] <Cork> might be a bit more complex then what you need
