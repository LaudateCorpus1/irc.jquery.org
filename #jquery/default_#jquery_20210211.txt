[05:03:27] <littlebit> hi poeple, I'm looking for an input validation for a numeric input field which should only allow numbers (integers) of 1 and above. In my search through the internet, I found this: https://codepedia.info/editor-example?id=11 now my regex is not the best, maybe there is someone here who could tell me the right expression
[05:04:37] <Cork> littlebit: why not just input type="number" min="1" step="1"> ?
[05:04:54] <Cork> * <input type="number" min="1" step="1"> ?
[05:05:36] <littlebit> Cork: true but it still allows the value 0 to be displayed. I want jquery to autocorrect this.
[05:05:50] <Cork> it does?
[05:05:58] <Cork> ah it does
[05:06:12] <littlebit> Cork: I'll check that and get back to you
[05:06:17] <Cork> well you could have a look at the jquery-validator plugin
[05:06:52] <Cork> though validation normally don't automatically change the value
[05:07:08] <Cork> if you want to prevent the entering of the value you will have to use input events
[05:07:09] <littlebit> not change, filter
[05:07:29] <Cork> well the filter still changes it
[05:07:37] <littlebit> Cork: yeah, prevent the entering of the value is the solution that I'm aiming   at
[05:08:12] <Cork> littlebit: i would recommend you to avoid that if you can, cause those input fields tend to be annoying as hell to use for the user
[05:08:51] <littlebit> I'll check your suggestions
[05:08:52] <Cork> (as it is very easy to move the cursur so ex. editing in the middle becomes inpossible and so on)
[05:09:36] <Cork> personally i would do something where i have a "fix" link in the error message and do the correction if that is clicked
[05:10:03] <Cork> that way you still leave the user in control of there input data
[11:04:01] <jak2000> hi all

[11:37:50] <shoky_> why not do what i said..... :\
[21:39:43] <physikoi> Hey #jquery, is it possible to use context for selecting form elements that are outside of said form when the "form" attribute is defined on these elements so as to match the form in question? EG. Given <form id='someForm'></form><input name='some-input' value='33' form='someForm'>, select form elements like this: `$("input", "#someForm")`. This doesn't work for obvious reasons, but perhaps there's some
[21:39:43] <physikoi> pseudo selector or other jquery method would do the trick?
[21:41:36] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to do something gross like $(':input').filter(function() {return $(this).prop('form') === 'foo'});
[21:41:48] <robertmaxrees> there are ways to use attribute selectors but they give me hives.
[21:43:31] <physikoi> thanks robertmaxrees.
[21:44:08] <physikoi> I just stumbled on a vanilla way of getting what I want: `const formData = new FormData(document.querySelector('form'))`, then loop. Works
[21:44:19] <robertmaxrees> what's another way.
[21:44:42] <robertmaxrees> *that's
[21:45:17] <physikoi> lol, i was staring at the screen wondering if I was the one that made a typo
[21:45:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
