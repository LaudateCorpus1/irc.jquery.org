[00:04:40] <crocket> How do I select <epub:trigger> element with jQuery?
[00:04:44] <crocket> I'm using jQuery 2.1.x
[00:04:46] <crocket> Help me
[00:31:53] <crocket> Where can I find documentation of $x?
[00:31:56] <crocket> $x is for xpath
[00:34:32] <tuskkk___> looking for some open code to play with jQuery, any ideas where can I find it?
[00:35:37] <crocket> What is $x?
[00:35:42] <behnampmdg3> Hi I have some code that disables the inputs in a tr $(this).closest('tr').find('input[type="text"]').not(this).prop('disabled', this.value.length).    But instead I want to keep still be able to oust that value. So I want to keep its value to none instead of disabling it.
[00:36:16] <behnampmdg3> So how can I keep the input disab;e but still post its value
[00:36:25] <behnampmdg3> Not sure if its even possib.e
[00:37:23] <behnampmdg3> Is anyone here?
[00:38:45] <jnhghy> is there a way to have a jquery-ui combobox with a "selected" value, with that selected value being created by a script on the final page? not in the combobox-ui.js file?
[01:49:54] <litropy> I just want to thank any devs paying attention right now. This lib is great.
[02:33:56] <varnie> hello.
[02:34:40] <varnie> I have a simple question regarding this: http://pastebin.com/c5hMuYZD
[02:35:20] <Cork> varnie: if you have a question ask it
[02:35:21] <varnie> sometimes it doesn't work as I expect, because all $placesInner items remain hidden. what am I doing wrong?
[02:35:39] <varnie> maybe lines 8-11 have a bug...
[02:36:08] <varnie> I want to take a random item from $placesInner and .show() it.
[02:36:46] <Cork> so use Math.random
[02:36:51] <Cork> ?g mdn Math.random
[02:36:52] <b-ot> Cork: Math.random() - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random
[02:37:11] <varnie> heh, I already use it.
[02:37:25] <Cork> then again; ask the question
[02:38:04] <varnie> Sometimes the code posted above doesn't work for me (because I see that all $placesInner items remain as if they were "non-shown")
[02:38:20] <varnie> my guess is that the lines 8-11 have a bug.
[02:38:47] <varnie> does this piece of code look OK to you?
[02:39:17] <varnie> my question is why it happens (i.e. all items remain hidden).
[02:46:48] <Cork> varnie: your sort function is invalid
[02:47:17] <Cork> varnie: sort should return -1 0 or 1
[02:47:25] <Cork> not random floats
[02:47:52] <varnie> what is a correct way to take random item from my $placesInner object?
[02:48:12] <varnie> say, it contains 5 divs
[02:48:54] <Cork> $placesInner.eq(Math.floor(Math.random() * $placesInner.length)).show()
[02:49:12] <varnie> thank you, I have to meditate on this.
[02:49:15] <Cork> also if ($placesInner == 1) { <-- this is invalid
[02:49:27] <Cork> $placesInner == 1 this will never be true
[02:49:28] <varnie> yes, I already noticed that. it is a typo.
[02:52:31] <varnie> I understood I misused .sort function. As a result it might leave items in non-sorted order, or what?
[02:52:45] <Cork> varnie: no
[02:52:47] <varnie> Anyway, why $placesInner.eq(0).show() in the end didn't work?
[02:52:54] <Cork> the function takes two arguments
[02:53:19] <Cork> if the first one should go after the second one return 1
[02:53:20] <varnie> because it doesn't matter whether its items being sorted or not. in the end we show the first item.
[02:53:30] <Cork> if the second one should go before the first return -1
[02:53:41] <varnie> yes, I agree.
[02:53:42] <Cork> and if they are equal return 0
[02:53:47] <Cork> that is how sort works
[02:53:56] <varnie> but I just wonder why $placesInner.eq(0).show() didn't work
[02:53:59] <Cork> so your function makes no sense
[02:54:24] <Cork> varnie: also .sort returns the change
[02:54:29] <Cork> so line 8-10 does nothing
[02:54:33] <io_____> Hi i am using this code http://codepad.org/H6t4LdnD and I get a "Cannot read property 'top' of null" when the  class I am targeting is not present in the dom, how can i fix that?
[02:54:37] <RizziCR> hi
[02:54:46] <Cork> and line 11 should work as long as the $placesInner is a jquery object
[02:54:57] <Cork> and you actually get into the else case
[02:55:29] <varnie> yes, but sometimes in my buggy version the line 11 doesn't work;)
[02:55:47] <Cork> io_____: if $(".region-content .block-views") is not found .offset() will return null
[02:56:01] <Cork> io_____: but your code doesn't check if offset is null so you crash
[02:56:20] <Cork> varnie: then you either don't get into the else case
[02:56:46] <varnie> possibly.
[02:56:47] <Cork> or $placesInner is empty or references elements not in the page or something else
[02:56:59] <Cork> either way it is something outside the snippet
[02:57:30] <varnie> thanks a lot. it helped.
[02:58:03] <io_____> Cork: so i have to wrap $(window).scroll(function() with a function that will check if offset is  null or not ?
[02:59:08] <Cork> io_____: no, just an if(offset === undefined) {  }
[02:59:13] <Cork> opps
[02:59:17] <Cork> io_____: no, just an if(offset !== undefined) {  }
[03:03:17] <varnie> Cork, if I use .sort without saving the result of its execution, I will continue working with "non-sorted" array as it was before .sort execution?
[03:03:17] <io_____> Cork: it was null not undefined but thanks
[03:03:28] <io_____> Cork: ++
[03:03:30] <Cork> varnie: yes
[03:55:39] <frank_o> Can someone help me decide between http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/ and http://owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/? =/
[03:56:07] <frank_o> Slick has more stars, but Owl feels better designed
[03:57:52] <frank_o> Ah ok, seems Slick was made because Owl wasn't good enough
[04:00:41] <click2> try both and see which is better!

[04:49:53] <manou> hello, i am having problem with a third party javascript code and I am seeing someting like $$(var).filter ...
[04:49:59] <manou> is that $$() selector valid ?
[04:50:15] <manou> it's the firt tiem I've seen
[04:50:30] <jarco> Hello, When I do a $('selector').load(function(){//console.log('hey')}); in a document ready it logs nothing at all. Is this normal behavior?
[04:51:02] <manou> maybe it's something like $data = $(data); $data.filter; .. ?¿
[04:51:35] <manou> i'll appreciate clarification to skip this issue and continue looking for other thing or inform them that this $$ is causing an error
[04:57:07] <msafi> Hey guys, I have this selector "video:not[controls]" which selects all video elements excluding the ones that have the 'controls' attribute. But how do I also exclude video elements that have the class, say, 'foo'?
[04:57:44] <msafi> Okay, that selector is wrong, apparently.
[04:58:04] <msafi> s/video:not[controls]/video:not([controls])
[04:58:29] <msafi> Would video:not([controls]):not(.foo) work?
[04:59:10] <ahandy> msafi: yes
[04:59:29] <msafi> ahandy: Thanks, I'll try it
[04:59:54] <jugglinmike> msafi: also try video:not(.foo[controls])
[05:00:09] <msafi> Okay, I'll test that too jugglinmike
[05:00:31] <Cork> jarco: .load(function) is a short hand for .on('load'
[05:01:04] <Cork> jarco: and that is only fired on iframe, object, img and the page
[05:01:22] <Cork> jarco: so you might be binding it to something that doesn't fire the event
[05:01:45] <Cork> jarco: also depending on where your code runs you might be missing the event
[05:01:58] <jarco> I am doing it on an ul
[05:02:08] <jarco> so that would be the problem here
[05:02:35] <Cork> jarco: the problem is that ul isn't a replaced element
[05:02:40] <Cork> so it never fires load events
[05:02:51] <Cork> jarco: so, what are you trying to do?
[05:04:28] <msafi> jugglinmike: that version selects this <video class="foo" src="videos/5.mp4" loop></video>
[05:04:28] <jarco> I am getting back that an element has a length of 0 (its an li that should have class .selected). But the class selected is not found on an li so I wanted to wait untill the ul was completely loaded (the ul is build dynamically added)
[05:04:43] <jarco> I am trying to figure out why it keeps being 0 first
[05:04:56] <jarco> something in my thinking pattern must be wrong
[05:05:17] <jugglinmike> msafi: yeah, I think I misread your requirements
[05:05:21] <Cork> jarco: you would have to use the callback from the ajax call
[05:06:46] <jugglinmike> you want to select elements that do not satisfy *either* requirement, not those that do not satisfy *both*. This means you'll need to use the selector you originally proposed
[05:06:55] <jarco> Cork, thanks for the advice (i feel so silly now) the problem was somewhere else
[05:08:00] <jarco> But I still learned that load cannot be used to wait on all elements :)
[05:14:55] <droid909> i have 2 arrays how do i check if at least one element is contained in both arrays?
[05:15:09] <droid909> is there a function in external libs?
[05:16:11] <droid909> i guess _.intersection(*arrays)  should do
[05:25:05] <gumble> can I somehow access the original this inside of $('form', this).submit(function( event ) { ?? because using this within there would refer to the form itself right?
[05:26:46] <gumble> if the question is not clear enough pleas tell, I will try to rephrase
[05:27:29] <tangorri> hi

[05:58:30] <kk_drop> I'm using slideUp/slideDown on $("table tr td").slideDown(). it starts ok, but then instead of slide there is jump to the end of animation. is there any property I should set on elements to make slideUp/slideDown work well?
[06:17:40] <Ali___> HI, Any one know about the jplayer. I have one question related to jplayer. I know this is not the right channel for jplayer. But still if anyone have knowledge about jplayer then it would be help for me to get answer to my issue.
[06:24:02] <PatBateman> hi
[06:24:30] <PatBateman> any chance to pass null value from javascript into mysql database?
[06:24:58] <PatBateman> without converting the accepted date on server side with php
[06:26:28] <PatBateman> ok forget it i was missing somethging..
[06:34:12] <gumble> when is $(document).ready triggered? I always thought only onload but it seems it triggers too if I change dom elements or on ajax done? somebody knows why that is so?
[06:35:32] <wunz> gumble: refer to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/158319/cross-browser-onload-event-and-the-back-button
[06:36:38] <gumble> wunz, no that isn't what I am searching for. i need document ready not to fire on ajax success
[06:36:46] <gumble> and I don't have a back button
[06:38:33] <BillCriswell> gumble: That sounds weird. Are you sure that's what's happening?
[06:38:56] <gumble> BillCriswell, no just wanted to ask if it is possible, that that is happening
[06:41:00] <BillCriswell> gumble: http://jsfiddle.net/z9nzt0t3/ I can't replicate it.
[06:41:17] <gumble> yes I think I found my mistake
[06:41:28] <gumble> hadn't to do anything with the ready refiring
[06:41:45] <BillCriswell> Sweet.
[06:43:34] <frank_o> For people who are using jQuery Mobile with their own custom UIs, would it be a better choice to switch to http://weblinc.github.io/jquery.smoothState.js/ entirely?
[06:43:37] <frank_o> From what I understand, jQuery Mobile is all about its UI. It is code heavy, has an immense backlog of things to do, and basic scrolling won't even work until version 1.7. What do you guys reckon?
[06:52:58] <BillCriswell> frank_o: These are two very different things.
[06:54:52] <Cork> frank_o: all i can say is that i'm not a fan of jqm
[06:54:54] <frank_o> BillCriswell: arent jqm and smoothstate the same with regards to page logic?
[06:55:04] <Cork> but some developers likes it
[06:55:12] <frank_o> BillCriswell: but in addition to that jqm has a bunch of widgets its borrowed from jquery ui, plus its own UI
[06:55:21] <frank_o> this is the only difference from what i understand
[06:55:25] <frank_o> Cork: hehe
[06:55:34] <spacebarbarian> I have a web service that returns binary image data via a POST request, is there any way to load this dynamically via an AJAX call ?
[06:55:39] <frank_o> Cork: well, now that ive developed my first app in jqm, i can say im not that big of a fan either :)
[06:56:02] <Cork> frank_o: and smooth state doesn't look to do most enything of jqm
[06:56:03] <frank_o> Cork: for instance ive made my own UI from scratch, but to do this i've had to disable a ton of jqm css and its a real mess
[06:56:15] <Cork> smoothstate looks much closer to quicklinks
[06:56:37] <frank_o> hmmm yeah
[06:56:59] <frank_o> forgot to mention that part.
[06:56:59] <Cork> sorry turbolinks not quick
[06:57:05] <frank_o> yeah :)
[06:57:21] <Cork> though turbolinks doesn't do the transitions
[06:57:48] <frank_o> true. currently i got turbolinks disabled while jqm does all the turbo stuff w/ transitions
[06:58:00] <frank_o> but also - jqm is knows for its bad transitions so..
[06:58:05] <frank_o> * is known
[06:58:39] <Cork> jqm is js first which is my biggest problem with jqm
[06:58:48] <Cork> jqm sites doesn't really work without js
[06:58:51] <Cork> for no good reason
[06:59:16] <frank_o> hmmm
[06:59:33] <frank_o> im gearing up to remove jqm from my entire app right about now
[07:00:08] <arschmitz> Cork jqm does work with out js thats the point of c-grade
[07:00:21] <Cork> arschmitz: c-grade?
[07:00:47] <Cork> arschmitz: you can write a site that looks and behaves like jqm
[07:00:52] <Cork> but can work without js
[07:00:56] <Cork> with no extra work
[07:01:03] <Cork> they just don't do it
[07:01:14] <arschmitz> cork: well it wont behave the same thats not possible some things require javascript
[07:01:16] <Cork> and that makes it a no option for me
[07:01:22] <arschmitz> but it does as close as reasonable with css only
[07:01:38] <Cork> arschmitz: well the difference is normally you get a full page reload instead of a snappy js action
[07:01:48] <Cork> exceptions is <canvas> things and similar
[07:02:02] <Cork> but i mainly talk about the basic things
[07:02:21] <Cork> (like reading the content you have on the page)
[07:02:56] <gumble> if I work inside a $('form', this).submit(function( event ) {..........}); block, 'this' refers to the form right? How do I access the object which originally was in this?
[07:03:19] <Cork> gumble: originally was?
[07:03:28] <Cork> you mean the fields has been removed?
[07:03:40] <arschmitz> Cork: jqm sites will be fully functional with out js
[07:03:50] <gumble> Cork, at the moment, when I selected the form via $('form', this), I had another object in 'this'
[07:04:07] <Cork> arschmitz: last i checked the basic site loading gives you a white page without js
[07:04:12] <arschmitz> just not as fancy its gracefull degradation and progressive enhancment
[07:04:18] <arschmitz> Cork: never
[07:04:19] <Cork> as the content is bascially a single app
[07:04:40] <Cork> gumble: ah, this is local to every function
[07:04:56] <Cork> gumble: if you want to forward it to a new function you need to assign it to a new name
[07:05:10] <arschmitz> Cork: http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/1.4/
[07:10:40] <aboudreault> is there any way to tell jquery to not trigger the error callback in case of ajax request "abort" ?
[07:12:42] <Cork> aboudreault: check the reason in the third argument to the callback
[07:13:23] <Cork> opps sorry
[07:13:24] <Cork> second
[07:13:28] <aboudreault> yep, that's what I'm doing (the second in fact). But Have to do it in multiple places. was wondering if I could set that behavior global
[07:13:37] <Cork> no
[07:13:41] <aboudreault> ok. thanks
[07:13:44] <Cork> hmm
[07:13:56] <Cork> ah, no
[07:15:32] <arschmitz> aboudreault: Cork: you can use http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajaxsetup/
[07:15:48] <Cork> arschmitz: sure, but not to hide error states
[07:16:10] <Cork> aboudreault: you could try using statusCode
[07:17:03] <aboudreault> there is statusCode for a browser abort?
[07:17:55] <Cork> don't think so
[07:18:01] <Cork> as it isn't a server response
[07:18:24] <aboudreault> so better to check the text status
[07:18:51] <Cork> aboudreault: you could add your own callback to jqxhr
[07:18:58] <Cork> and use that to proxy error
[07:20:28] <Cork> aboudreault:  function fetch() { var callback = $.Callback(); jqxhr = $.ajax(); jqxhr.fail(function(...) { callback.fire(); }); jqxhr.filteredFail = callback.add; return jqxhr; }
[07:20:31] <Cork> something like that
[07:20:46] <Cork> bach let me make a fiddle
[07:22:58] <Cork> aboudreault: http://jsfiddle.net/953xbd53/1/
[07:23:37] <aboudreault> yeah, that would be a good wrapper
[07:24:14] <Cork> opps typo
[07:24:26] <Cork> li'

[08:08:16] <NoiseEee> pdcmoreira: cdns = lol
[08:08:26] <pdcmoreira> ?
[08:08:48] <pdcmoreira> wht?
[08:08:52] <pdcmoreira> why?
[08:09:49] <NoiseEee> well js ones at least. i never like them - extra dns lookup, versions rarely cached properly
[08:10:59] <pdcmoreira> what are you talking about? faster for clients because of caching and the js is fetched from 2 servers
[08:11:08] <pdcmoreira> i mean, from a different server
[08:11:21] <pdcmoreira> also, better for your server because of load balancing
[08:11:32] <pdcmoreira> there are only advantages
[08:11:36] <pdcmoreira> for both side
[08:11:38] <pdcmoreira> sides
[08:12:12] <pdcmoreira> if you link to a specific version, the header tells the client to cache for a YEAR
[08:12:49] <pdcmoreira> only if client clears the cache (or reaches limit) it gets cleared
[08:14:36] <pdcmoreira> i don't rly see the "lol" here
[08:16:09] <tokam> I like to replace an element by an other element which should be defined like this
[08:16:17] <tokam> $('<a>class="sdasdss_0" href="http://www.guter-webhoster.de/project/webhosting/visit.php?p=hostpapa" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="//www.guter-webhoster.de/wp-content/themes/alexandria/images/hoster-banners/webhoster-banner-hostpapa.png" alt="Logo Hostpapa.de Webhosting"><br><span>Tarif: HostPapa-Plan</span></a>')
[08:16:23] <tokam> anyways this does not work, why?
[08:16:32] <tokam> I have the string in an variable.
[08:16:40] <BillCriswell> tokam: How are you trying to replace it?
[08:16:43] <pdcmoreira> element.replace()
[08:16:50] <tokam> 					var replacement = '<a>' + this.outerHTML.substring(6, this.outerHTML.length - 7)+ '</a>';
[08:16:50] <tokam> 					alert(replacement);
[08:16:50] <tokam> 					$(this).replaceWith($(replacement))
[08:16:52] <pdcmoreira> element.replace(new)
[08:17:00] <pdcmoreira> replaceWith exacly
[08:17:09] <tokam> http://guter-webhoster.de/
[08:17:23] <jop008> I got Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'jquery' of null  on a ajax call can't find out what is wrong
[08:17:25] <decx> dat keyword domain
[08:17:48] <pdcmoreira> tokam: $(this) doesn't always have the reference you are expecting
[08:18:01] <pdcmoreira> try saving the reference to the element to a var
[08:18:01] <tokam> when I replaces with <h2>foo</h2> it worked
[08:18:14] <sacho> please paste your code in a paste site.
[08:18:25] <pdcmoreira> var replacement = '<a>' + th ... is not a jquery element
[08:18:54] <tokam> Maybe it is an issue, that the element I try to create is complex html?
[08:19:01] <pdcmoreira> you must do var replacement = $('<a />').append($('<th />')) ...
[08:19:06] <sacho> Perhaps all cdns should allow CORS so you could handle a case where they are non-responsive.
[08:19:17] <BillCriswell> tokam: It looks like it has to be appended to the dom before you can use replaceWith?
[08:20:21] <sacho> no.
[08:20:25] <tokam> I appended now to body
[08:20:30] <tokam> and it looks as weird as before
[08:20:37] <sacho> how about posting a test case.
[08:21:08] <BillCriswell> Here's my test case: http://jsbin.com/ratukeyeqehu/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:22:41] <tokam> If you try to replace with an anchor that has attributes you end up with the same issue
[08:23:01] <tokam> With my replacement
[08:23:02] <tokam> <a>class="sdasdss_0" href="http://www.guter-webhoster.de/project/webhosting/visit.php?p=hostpapa" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="//www.guter-webhoster.de/wp-content/themes/alexandria/images/hoster-banners/webhoster-banner-hostpapa.png" alt="Logo Hostpapa.de Webhosting"><br><span>Tarif: HostPapa-Plan</span></a>
[08:23:59] <tokam> lol
[08:24:02] <tokam> my code is wrong
[08:24:32] <tokam> cos I replaced with <a>....
[08:26:04] <DeltaHeavy> If I have something along the lines of    $('a').each(function (i, element) { .. });    And I'm using $(element) more than once, is it worthwhile to cache $(element) into a variable?
[08:26:27] <sacho> maybe.
[08:27:48] <BillCriswell> sacho: When wouldn't you? Curious.
[08:28:44] <sacho> Well, it might be even more worthwhile to not wrap it in a jquery object at all
[08:29:22] <DeltaHeavy> sacho: How would that work? I need to access the href.
[08:29:27] <BillCriswell> sacho: Totally.
[08:29:30] <sacho> element.href
[08:29:37] <DeltaHeavy> I thought I tried that. Lemme double check
[08:30:01] <BillCriswell> sacho: Assuming you need it as a jQuery object is what I was assuming.
[08:30:06] <DeltaHeavy> Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[08:30:19] <sacho> There's no function call in element.href
[08:30:47] <DeltaHeavy> if (linkIsPdf.test(element.attr('href'))) {
[08:30:53] <BillCriswell> .href and not .href() (think that's what you're doing).
[08:31:09] <DeltaHeavy> I'm not calling a function off of href
[08:31:10] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: No .attr, just .href
[08:31:12] <DeltaHeavy> OH
[08:31:13] <sacho> BillCriswell, well, I'd do it reflexively, but I wouldn't go out of my way to change code that doesn't - unless there's an actual case of it reducing performance noticably
[08:31:32] <sacho> there's an opportunity cost to changing it that might not be worth paying
[08:32:31] <DeltaHeavy> Need to do this too...bit more confused about this as I'm unsure if there are going to be existing classes on that and all - element.addClass('mte-icon-custom__pdf');
[08:32:33] <sacho> especially if you're still building your app(that code might not even exist later!)
[08:32:54] <sacho> DeltaHeavy, well, you'd generally want to use a jquery object for that.
[08:33:27] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Depending on browser support you can do element.classList.add('something') I think, but jQuery makes this safer on old browsers.
[08:33:33] <DeltaHeavy> Ok, so if I had two instances of this would it be worth caching?
[08:33:42] <DeltaHeavy> I need IE8
[08:33:55] <sacho> DeltaHeavy, just cache it if it bothers you.
[08:34:05] <BillCriswell> The classList only works in IE10+, yuck.
[08:36:11] <DeltaHeavy> sacho: It doesn't bother me, I just want to know what's the optimum way to do it.
[08:38:00] <BillCriswell> I think "optimum" is most readable until you need to really worry about something else.
[08:38:17] <DeltaHeavy> True, thanks.
[09:06:25] <shoky> .
[09:24:43] <sacho> thanks.
[09:42:12] <rudeboy_> Either I'm on drugs or I'm losing my mind, but can someone please tell me why this as-simple-as-possible html file returns "jquery is undefined"? http://paste.ofcode.org/SQVHvjTVeHdQCJ72biLmkh
[09:42:57] <aitiba> hi
[09:43:27] <AlexR2> rudeboy_: jquery is undefined... jQuery probably isn't
[09:43:39] <decx> // doesnt work when you juts open the file becuas ethen it's file://
[09:44:12] <aitiba> someone has problem sending variables to pluploader as multipart_params using jquerys.val like $('#name').val() please?
[09:44:51] <rudeboy_> AlexR2, Still no luck
[09:45:00] <decx> what i said rudeboy_ :p
[09:45:01] <rudeboy_> decx, shouldn't that be loading it from online?
[09:45:21] <decx> // uses the protocol that is active
[09:45:49] <decx> when you open that file locally it tries file:////ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js and fails
[09:45:50] <shoky> you need to close the <script> tags
[09:45:57] <rudeboy_> decx, so this whole time I was just supposed to add http.............>?
[09:45:57] <shoky> tag, sorry
[09:46:14] <decx> or use localhost
[09:46:20] <decx> then // will do again
[09:46:26] <decx> because it's http/https
[09:47:14] <rudeboy_> decx, If I add http, then the error goes away. But maybe I should just download it manually ha ha
[09:47:42] <decx> do you know why it's // ?
[09:48:06] <decx> it prevents mixed assets when you have a https section on your site
[09:48:21] <rudeboy_> decx, Oh, I didn't know that :)
[09:48:47] <decx> i think some browsers will say: "loading unsecure assets" or something when you load a file from http:// on a https:// site
[09:49:42] <rudeboy_> decx, Thanks for that spot of info, was wondering about that the other day :)
[09:51:18] <rudeboy_> decx, Have you ever worked with Filtrify.js?
[09:52:01] <decx> no
[09:58:53] <rudeboy_> How do you figure out why a jquery plugin is not working when there are no errors in the console?
[10:00:02] <robertmaxrees> rudeboy_ depends on the plugin and what i'm expecting
[10:01:34] <rudeboy_> robertmaxrees, I'm trying to get a tag filtering plugin to work, that is supposed to load a dropdown in a placeholder (#placeholder). Absolutely nothing iis happening though, with no errors. I've included all the right files and such
[10:01:46] <robertmaxrees> your selectors are all right?
[10:02:09] <robertmaxrees> your data exists?
[10:02:10] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[10:02:10] <rudeboy_> robertmaxrees, Yea
[10:02:19] <robertmaxrees> can you fiddle it then?
[10:07:12] <rudeboy_> robertmaxrees, I just figured out what was happening (8 hours later). Wordpress had a css selector that was overiding the placeholder. Oh glory
[10:09:26] <rudeboy_> robertmaxrees, Hmm..spoke to soon ha ha. Flip man
[10:36:45] <nezZario> Ehhh
[10:36:53] <nezZario> How do I say "all inputs NOT in class foo"
[10:37:09] <nezZario> $('input.!foo') .. ish
[10:37:09] <robertmaxrees> $('input').not('.foo')
[10:37:24] <nezZario> sweet, my google-fu was failing me, thanks
[10:37:52] <robertmaxrees> for more specifics: http://api.jquery.com/not/
[10:38:01] <robertmaxrees> there's also a not selector but I'd avoid it since it's slow.
[10:38:40] <decx> i know what movie i'm watching tonight: Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women
[10:38:50] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[10:38:57] <decx> (1968)
[10:39:00] <DeltaHeavy> What's the best way to return something from inside a jQ $.ajax.done function? I'm seeing a bunch of stuff online but a lot of it looks gross.
[10:39:22] <robertmaxrees> you don't normally return out of it since it's asyn
[10:39:38] <robertmaxrees> *async.  you put your callback logic into the deverred methods on it.
[10:39:59] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: I have a reusable function that has an $.ajax request in it. I need that function to return the value. There's no sane way to do this?
[10:40:14] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy the function will return before the ajax completes.
[10:40:17] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: Different areas of the JS that acll this functions will be doing different stuff with the expected value.
[10:40:24] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: So I can't really do much about this?
[10:40:34] <decx> that's the nature of async
[10:40:44] <robertmaxrees> the ajax request fires off and your code keeps trucking on.
[10:40:58] <robertmaxrees> anything that relies on the ajax finishing needs to be in the callbacks for that request.
[10:41:00] <DeltaHeavy> Craaaaap >:
[10:41:02] <DeltaHeavy> I guess DRY principle doesn't really apply here >:
[10:41:08] <robertmaxrees> sure it does.
[10:41:32] <robertmaxrees> you can pass a callback (or callbacks) for ajax to run when its done.
[10:41:38] <robertmaxrees> or specify them manually.
[10:41:41] <DeltaHeavy> This is my function - http://jsfiddle.net/k6tpok7t/
[10:41:58] <drej> no its not, steve wrote it
[10:41:59] <drej> i seen't him
[10:43:03] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k6tpok7t/2/
[10:43:27] <robertmaxrees> you could tweak that so callback is an array of callbacks instead, too.
[10:43:57] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: Oh damn. Awesome. Thanks!

[11:30:07] <frank_o> Hi! For this minimal jQuery slideshow, does anybody know how to make the 2nd and 3rd image slide in tandem like the 1st and 2nd one? Trying to avoid the flashing background during slide change: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/eku4Lwt1/41/
[11:31:15] <frank_o> * Trying to make this minimal jQuery slideshow, but why does only the 1st and 2nd image "slide together"? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/eku4Lwt1/41/
[12:25:37] <_r0m3> i have kind of a two-fold question... i'm trying to make two onclick event scripts for the submit button -- the 1st to warn users to confirm their inputted data; and the 2nd to just proceed with the submission...
[12:25:42] <_r0m3> since i need the scripts to go in order, at the moment (and i'm not adept at js), i have the first script issuing the alert to user, then doing a "preventDefault" and declaring a variable that the 2nd script will check to see that it exists.
[12:25:47] <_r0m3> so, here's my question: 1... is this logic practical? 2... is there a better way?
[12:28:13] <robertmaxrees> entirely depends on the rest of your code :)
[12:28:27] <robertmaxrees> you only need one handler for that though
[12:28:53] <_r0m3> $('#form_submit').click(function(e){
[12:29:04] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[12:29:09] <robertmaxrees> bind to the form's submit event instead.
[12:29:14] <_r0m3> ah
[12:32:13] <_r0m3> how would you handle a situation like this, robertmaxrees? generally speaking, since i know you said it depends.
[12:32:56] <robertmaxrees> single event handler on the form submit with some kind of data attribute or something else scoped to hold state.
[12:33:13] <robertmaxrees> or i'd use a confirmation dialog with OK and Cancel buttons, instead of a simple alert.
[12:33:48] <_r0m3> with the dialogue, will that use preventdefault?
[12:34:17] <_r0m3> i suppose if they cancel
[12:35:13] <robertmaxrees> i'd personally avoid using the dialogue at all, but I don't know your use case.
[12:37:09] <_r0m3> this is all a ridiculous workaround to the fact that ie8 doesn't support a canvas field (for digital signatures), therefore i have a VML-based field that i can't figure out how to check if it's blank...
[12:37:34] <robertmaxrees> what is this platform for?
[12:37:36] <_r0m3> as i'm trying to avoid submissions missing a signature, i figured the best i could do was alert them before they submit
[12:37:47] <_r0m3> wordpress
[12:37:54] <robertmaxrees> err, not what i meant.
[12:38:00] <_r0m3> sorry :(
[12:38:01] <robertmaxrees> do you have to support IE8?
[12:38:25] <_r0m3> well, i have up until this point -- rather, the site otherwise supports it
[12:38:39] <_r0m3> only have this issue
[12:38:42] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you not just have a stateful variable that flips when the user uploads or whatver?
[12:39:34] <_r0m3> i just worry that i am beyond my scope of knowledge :/
[12:39:46] <robertmaxrees> always work for the good solution, not the solution you know.
[12:39:47] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:39:49] <_r0m3> it's killing the OCD in me, but i'm at wit's end
[12:40:25] <_r0m3> the practical in me says "how friggin hard is it to check if this field is empty?!"
[12:40:43] <robertmaxrees> why not try to select the elements in question?
[12:40:54] <robertmaxrees> since vml is a markup language.
[12:41:20] <_r0m3> how do you mean exactly?
[12:41:42] <robertmaxrees> it's markup, just like HTML.  have to tried selecting like you would any other element?
[12:41:51] <_r0m3> hmm
[12:41:53] <robertmaxrees> document.getElementsByTagName() or $()?
[12:41:57] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/14916571/923919
[12:42:07] <_r0m3> no, i haven't...
[12:42:11] <_r0m3> hmmm
[12:42:22] <_r0m3> so you're suggesting to treat it like any other input element?
[12:42:28] <robertmaxrees> *markup element, yes
[12:42:30] <_r0m3> and check its value or whatever?
[12:42:34] <robertmaxrees> nonono
[12:42:40] <_r0m3> sorry, lol
[12:42:41] <robertmaxrees> see if the element has any children or whatever
[12:42:56] <_r0m3> (checking your link now)
[12:43:16] <robertmaxrees> there should be a given element that exists when it's blank that gets populated with children.
[12:43:44] <_r0m3> ahh, now you're speaking the language of humans
[12:43:52] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:44:41] <_r0m3> i'm troubleshooting on IE8, and it's awful trying to use the dev tools. bear with me a moment.
[12:44:56] <robertmaxrees> you could use firebug lite instead.
[12:45:04] <_r0m3> k
[12:45:24] <robertmaxrees> this is where you read the VML spec or a guide or something.
[12:46:00] <Velveeta> you can also use visual studio web developer express edition
[12:46:05] <robertmaxrees> *bam*
[12:46:09] <Velveeta> which also sucks, but not as badly as the IE tools sometimes
[12:46:19] <robertmaxrees> IE11's tools are pretty cool imo.
[12:46:35] <Velveeta> yeah, i still haven't played with them yet, but i've seen several demos, and they look much nicer
[12:46:40] <robertmaxrees> i like 'em.
[12:47:00] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to do a few weeks of old IE only browser usage soon.
[12:47:08] <robertmaxrees> force myself to experience out sites.
[12:47:24] <Velveeta> you lost a bet didn't you
[12:47:27] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:47:34] <robertmaxrees> i'm the only windows user on my team :)
[12:47:37] <Velveeta> masochistic tendencies?
[12:47:39] <robertmaxrees> i actually want to do it because i hate myself.
[12:47:45] <Velveeta> there we go
[12:48:10] <robertmaxrees> and i'm the only person who knows anything about old IE js bugs.  which isn't very much.
[12:48:12] <Velveeta> all of our front end devs are on macs, but most of them have to work in windows vm's because they're on c# products
[12:48:27] <Velveeta> so they get to feel all the same pain as a typical windows user
[12:48:34] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:48:39] <robertmaxrees> i still prefer windows, but meh.
[12:49:05] <Velveeta> i like being on a product team that i don't have to open those VM's until it comes time to run the tests
[12:49:38] <Velveeta> it took a while for me to get used to osx, coming from a windows background, and i don't typically mind one more than the other as a standalone os, but when i have to run windows in a vm on osx, it can be painful at times
[12:49:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah i've seen that pain before.
[12:50:00] <robertmaxrees> i use the modern.ie VMs for old IE versions all the time.
[12:50:17] <robertmaxrees> plus my dev environment uses vagrant, so that's another VM that's running all the time.
[12:50:27] <_r0m3> wait -- if the plugin i'm using has a VML fallback for IE8, then aren't I stuck having to troubleshoot on that browser?
[12:50:29] <_r0m3> dangit
[12:50:46] <robertmaxrees> _r0m3 sure - but you can use firebug lite in IE8
[12:50:53] <_r0m3> ahh, perfect :)
[12:51:06] <robertmaxrees> also: rip open the plugin's source for the vallback and see what they're building out.
[12:51:37] <Velveeta> yeah, i still have to get some modern.ie vm's set up for our karma tests, but i've been putting that off, just because i don't want to deal with the downloads mostly :D
[12:52:07] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta hahahaha.  we setup automated testing recently with selenium for everything.
[12:52:18] <robertmaxrees> we're slowly getting everything jotted down.
[12:52:38] <robertmaxrees> code coverage is up as soon as we figure out what we're moving our frontend to.
[12:53:10] <Velveeta> i just spent the last 2 weeks writing 482 tests for coverage on my product, from unit to e2e, and am currently running them all through safari/ff/chrome (phantom for smoke testing during development), and still have to set up the IE vm's it to launch
[12:53:28] <robertmaxrees> have you setup any sort of frontend error monitoring btw?
[12:53:34] <Velveeta> but we're not running selenium on my product, it helps not being an actual product so much as a collection of components, no need to navigate anywhere
[12:53:46] <Velveeta> error monitoring in what sense?
[12:54:02] <robertmaxrees> well, actually general error monitoring.  check out new relic.
[12:54:57] <robertmaxrees> their js errors system is still in beta, but if gives you near-realtime info about errors being through on your pages.
[12:54:57] <Velveeta> we haven't rolled out anything like that for ourselves yet
[12:55:09] <Velveeta> we only hear about scalability issues when they should actually be considered design issues :D
[12:55:10] <robertmaxrees> if you ever get the chance, do it. it's awesome.
[12:55:37] <_r0m3> sheesh, you guys are the real deal.
[12:55:39] <Velveeta> when people say things like "yeah, your ellipser widget gets slow when we have 250 of them on a page" and i say "well no shit, you should have 250 ellipsed elements on a page, who ok'd that?"
[12:55:48] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta hahahahahahaha
[12:55:49] <robertmaxrees> that's awesome.
[12:55:57] <Velveeta> shouldn't* have :D
[12:56:08] <robertmaxrees> _r0m3 :) what sort of company do you work at?
[12:56:28] <Velveeta> _r0m3: yeah, ever since i started strictly working front end, i've gotten so much better than i used to
[12:56:50] <Velveeta> i look at myself from 3 years ago, thinking how much of a ninja i was, and realizing i'd consider myself a hobbyist w/ those skills
[12:57:06] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta right?!
[12:57:19] <Velveeta> and i can't wait to think terribly about my current self, 3 years from now
[12:57:30] <_r0m3> i'm more of a "creative" -- or rather, a creative-meets-entrepreneur
[12:57:41] <Velveeta> if you can't look back at something from 6 months ago, and think "wtf was i smoking when i wrote this?" you're not learning enough :D
[12:57:45] <robertmaxrees> _r0m3 hrm.
[12:57:52] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta aaaah thank you
[12:58:02] <robertmaxrees> i know so many people that don't push themselves.  drives me crazy
[12:58:28] <Velveeta> we have a really top notch front end team here, we look for that hunger for learning specifically, as part of the hiring process
[12:58:36] <robertmaxrees> good.
[12:58:41] <robertmaxrees> you guys are serving the internet well.
[12:58:49] <_r0m3> i appreciate you guys being here to offer help -- that's awesome.
[12:59:04] <_r0m3> i would be nowhere without people like you.
[12:59:25] <Velveeta> we've passed on candidates that had decent skill sets just because they claim working with it for 10 years or so, and we'll be like "well, this guy was ok, but for 10 years, i would expect him to be higher than a junior level position.. the fact that he isn't tells me he's not very motivated to better himself"
[12:59:49] <robertmaxrees> _r0m3 we're giving back to the community that helped us grow
[12:59:55] <Velveeta> rightio :)
[13:01:41] <Velveeta> the way i see it, a progression in skills should go from curious hacker to hobbyist, to proficient, to expert, to mastery, and as you gain each of those tiers of knowledge, you get more comfortable as an influencer also, from influencing people within your immediate team, to an organization as a whole, to the community
[13:01:57] <marc_v92> Velveeta: I agree with your “6 months ago” statement, but only to a certain extent. If you’re building things out to be progressively enhanced and to meet current standards, there’s no reason for code from 6 months ago to be that bad. ;)
[13:01:58] <Velveeta> and that's when you start getting the drive to get out there and dump knowledge to help the next generation learn properly
[13:02:39] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta it's about contribution back to the craft.
[13:02:47] <Velveeta> marc_v92: that's true, and that's the kind of pattern you start to learn from experience, how to write your code in such a way that it can be more easily tweaked in the future instead of requiring a rewrite
[13:03:11] <_r0m3> well said, velveeta.
[13:03:19] <Velveeta> we had a discussion about this here at my work just last week, where we were talking about the difference in mindsets between an engineer and an architect
[13:03:45] <marc_v92> Velveeta: Right. :) Though, in all honesty, I think every dev has at least one project from within the past 12 months that they hope never comes to light again. :-P
[13:03:58] <Velveeta> an engineer can solve whatever problems you throw at them, but a lot of the time, new problems pop up from those solutions a few months later, whereas an architect tries to solve it in such a way that they anticipate those problems and avoid them before they ever happen
[13:04:34] <Velveeta> you start to notice a whole different vocabulary start to surface, with words like "scalability" and "ease of maintenance" and whatnot
[13:05:03] <_r0m3> side note: this is all fascinating :) see what kinda dialogue i spark?
[13:05:24] <Velveeta> i like to point out to people that yes, while you can write that highly optimized version of your function, you're probably only shaving milliseconds, and when somebody has to revisit that code a year from now, they'll be struggling to realize what the hell it's doing... and more often than not, that someone is you
[13:05:34] <Velveeta> _r0m3: indeed :D
[13:05:50] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta thank you!
[13:06:02] <robertmaxrees> be explicit, not implicit.
[13:06:03] <Velveeta> so i always favor explicitly-stated code over optimizations (until optimizations are necessary)
[13:06:05] <Velveeta> right
[13:06:09] <_r0m3> i can definitely see parallels with entrepreneurship.
[13:06:16] <robertmaxrees> unreadable code is not badass as much as bad.
[13:06:40] <Velveeta> right, unless you're planning to enter that thing in JS1k or something, flesh it out a little bit
[13:07:11] <Velveeta> i've also seen people write function declarations like this: function doSomething(a, b, c) { a.whatever(); b.blahblahblah(); etc }
[13:07:24] <robertmaxrees> whaaaaa
[13:07:25] <robertmaxrees> :(
[13:07:25] <Velveeta> and i'm like "dude... give your variables some meaningful names, stop trying to shave bytecount
[13:07:29] <Velveeta> let the minifier handle that
[13:07:37] <robertmaxrees> can you come work for us? :)
[13:07:41] <Velveeta> heheheh
[13:07:50] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to tell people stuff like that all the time.
[13:07:51] <_r0m3> yeah, i hate seeing that in plugin code... but i guess understand... if they're trying to be proprietary, right?
[13:07:56] <robertmaxrees> luckily there's some good traction.
[13:08:08] <Velveeta> i've often said i'll be w/ my company until google's ready to scoop me up... i'd love the opportunity to work with paul irish and addy osmani
[13:08:10] <robertmaxrees> _r0m3 you should have 2 versions of each plugin - a dev version and a production version.
[13:08:15] <_r0m3> ah
[13:08:27] <Velveeta> but i'm glued to my current city for at least another 6-7 years anyway
[13:08:35] <robertmaxrees> kids?
[13:08:48] <Velveeta> yup, divorced w/ a baby-mama in the same city
[13:08:51] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[13:08:54] <_r0m3> lol
[13:09:02] <Velveeta> so once he hits 18, the game's on for wherever i want to actually settle
[13:09:09] <Velveeta> someplace with more than 2 seasons would be awesome
[13:09:15] <robertmaxrees> hahaha where are you now?
[13:09:15] <_r0m3> lol
[13:09:21] <robertmaxrees> because that sounds like my city
[13:09:24] <marc_v92> Texas, according to his IP. :-P
[13:09:36] <marc_v92> #notacreeper
[13:09:41] <Velveeta> heheheh
[13:09:45] <Velveeta> yep, austin
[13:09:46] <_r0m3> lmao, i thought "creep" when i read that.
[13:09:53] <_r0m3> but in a nice way :)
[13:10:17] <marc_v92> _r0m3: Oh, of course. ;)
[13:10:29] <Velveeta> but that's one reason i like to sit in here and dump out knowledge
[13:10:39] <Velveeta> and i keep a tech blog that's long overdue for an update
[13:10:46] <robertmaxrees> i need to update mine, too.
[13:10:54] <Velveeta> because people need to be learnt right n such
[13:11:39] <marc_v92> Velveeta: The only part that’s difficult for me is that I currently work for a marketing agency. Granted, it’s one of the best I’ve worked with, but at the end of the day, they’re only in web development because that’s a good way to market. If that ever changes, they’ll be happy to let our entire team go and save some money.
[13:12:19] <lolmaus> What is the recommended way of storing data externally associated to a jQuery collection? E. g. i have `var $foo = $('.foo'), bar = 'bar';`. I would like to store `bar` in `$foo`. How should i do it? 1) `$foo.bar = bar;` 2) `$foo.data('bar') = bar;` 3) something else?
[13:12:47] <marc_v92> So while as a team, we constantly push for the best (progressive enhancement, fully standards-compliant, staying ahead of trends, etc), but as soon as it passes outside our dev team, you hit a wall of management that doesn’t understand any of what we do, and is therefore hesitant to invest any time/money into the things we pass on.
[13:12:53] <robertmaxrees> lolmaus that's a really awkward idea.
[13:13:51] <robertmaxrees> lolmaus you could make an object propery the jquery collection and make another prop your extra data.
[13:15:35] <Velveeta> lolmaus: $foo.data('bar', bar) is how i'd do it
[13:15:54] <robertmaxrees> that associated that data with one element, though
[13:15:59] <lolmaus> Velveeta: yeah, that's what i meant under 2)
[13:16:00] <robertmaxrees> he's talking about a collection.
[13:16:08] <Velveeta> marc_v92: yeah, i've been in similar situations, and it can be difficult to grow as an engineer in those kinds of situations
[13:16:11] <Velveeta> ahhhh gotcha
[13:16:12] <lolmaus> robertmaxrees: i'm sorry for the confusion. Each $foo contains only one element.
[13:16:31] <robertmaxrees> ah, then yeah.
[13:16:37] <robertmaxrees> if the object is one element, use .data()
[13:16:39] <lolmaus> robertmaxrees: why do you consider the idea to be awkward in the first place?
[13:16:40] <Velveeta> yeah, if it's just single-item collections, you can just use .data
[13:16:56] <robertmaxrees> lolmaus it's not
[13:16:57] <Velveeta> if it's a multi-item collection, i'd have to think on that
[13:16:59] <lolmaus> robertmaxrees: Velveeta: thank you.
[13:17:37] <Velveeta> marc_v92: usually the only way to gain traction in an organization like that is to prove out your case fiscally
[13:17:49] <afidegnum> hi, I have posted an issue but no answer still.   I amusing comment easy reply,     but form by default is opened and i can see clicking on the reply link, it can be closed but Idon't know the exact code which can help out. can you please help? what can I modify to have a closed form?     here is the link.    http://www.illuztrate.com/steps/step-step-ubuntu-installation
[13:18:04] <Velveeta> you'd have to gather metrics and show why certain things equal more money than others, at least to the point that they started to trust your actual intuition and just let you run with ideas
[13:18:18] <afidegnum> this is a jquery function
[13:18:34] <Velveeta> you can also try providing it out through the cost of labor and ongoing maintenance.. if you can't prove it out through increased conversions, you can prove it out through decreased labor costs
[13:18:44] <Velveeta> and faster time to market for new ideas
[13:18:47] <robertmaxrees> afidegnum can you create a minimal test case or elaborate some more?
[13:19:00] <Velveeta> that's how you can try to get a wedge in for the idea of rolling out a development framework like backbone or angular
[13:19:31] <afidegnum> robertmaxrees: I don't get that point pls
[13:20:05] <Velveeta> afidegnum: go to jsfiddle.net and try to put together a working demo that we can mess around with
[13:20:19] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:21:31] <Velveeta> try to make the demo as isolated as possible, meaning if only 1 piece of a page is being a problem, try to just duplicate that one piece of the page, not the entire page
[13:22:07] <marc_v92> Velveeta: Oh, trust me, we’ve tried that, lol. Sadly, the organization is 40 years old, and heavily rooted in their traditions. There are a lot of sensitive areas that you’re not really allowed to go into, even though quite a few of them don’t really make sense. I’ve been here for 15 months and I don’t even have a laptop yet. They’re not standard issue for our devs. To get one, you have to plead your case with management, and
[13:22:08] <marc_v92> there happens to be surplus in another department’s budget, you might get lucky and get one.
[13:22:17] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta we should start a "pragmatic programmer" blog and put stuff like "how to get help on IRC" in there.
[13:22:24] <marc_v92> Velveeta: I won’t go into the company’s finances too much, but let’s just say they’re not strapped for cash or anything, lol.
[13:22:57] <Velveeta> marc_v92: well, in some of those situations, sometimes it's better to ask for forgiveness than for permission ;)
[13:23:16] <Velveeta> sometimes, if you know you're right, and think you can get away with it, just do it, and then later play dumb
[13:23:17] <decx> robertmaxrees and ironically the page only contains a webchat widget
[13:23:40] <robertmaxrees> decx++
[13:23:49] <robertmaxrees> marc_v92 you should start looking around if you haven't already.
[13:23:52] <marc_v92> Velveeta: Yep, that’s what I’ve had to do, lol. I’m not exactly viewed highly by management because of some of the concerns I’ve brought up over the past year. But at the same time, there’s no long-term career path for me here, anyway.
[13:23:55] <robertmaxrees> i was stunted at a similar place not that long ago.
[13:24:53] <marc_v92> robertmaxrees: Yeah, I’m lucky enough to live in Canada’s startup hub, and I’ve got a lot of connections, so I’m not too worried about finding something a little better suited for me. :)
[13:24:59] <robertmaxrees> good.
[13:30:13] <hlvwrk> fdsjfdsjkfdsf
[13:32:10] <afidegnum> robertmeeting: I couldn't run the fiddle but here is hte folowing js script you can see
[13:32:12] <afidegnum> http://pastebin.com/6AbnyPPp
[13:32:48] <afidegnum> the culplrit is #edit-comment-body
[13:36:01] <dmsuperman> hlvwrk: call a doctor! You're having a seizure!
[13:36:05] <afidegnum> any insight?
[13:39:00] <hlvwrk> SEIZURE IN PROGRESS
[13:39:01] * hlvwrk dies
[13:39:02] <robertmaxrees> afidegnum we asked for a stripped down fiddle.  can you not give us that?
[13:39:24] <afidegnum> I pasted it but no effect there
[13:40:09] <robertmaxrees> could you share again?
[13:40:09] <Velveeta> i don't see anything being done with #edit-comment-body, or with the comment_form variable you're caching it into
[13:40:20] <Velveeta> apart from you declaring the variable, it's not being used anywhere
[13:40:29] <Velveeta> at least, in that snippet you pasted
[13:50:50] <WeiJunLi>  can someone help me with a css issue on my jsfiddle proj. (sorry ask in this channel but the css channel has few users active and usually who uses jquery also use css)
[13:54:51] <Velveeta> weijunli: fiddle link?
[13:56:29] <robertmaxrees> lol WeiJunLi
[13:56:42] <robertmaxrees> did you at least try asking there?
[13:57:17] <WeiJunLi> robertmaxrees: ofcourse since this afternoon
[13:57:29] <WeiJunLi> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/2vcnbnkh/4/
[13:57:45] <WeiJunLi> I want to put the title inside the img and the snippet in the bottom just like a dropdown effect
[13:58:07] <Velveeta> http://i.imgur.com/GQlCN5k.gif
[13:59:21] <Velveeta> i'm not sure what you mean by "and the snippet in the bottom just like a dropdown effect"
[14:00:05] <WeiJunLi> Velveeta: the title will be above of the snippet but the tittle will be inside of the img.
[14:00:14] <WeiJunLi> and the snippet outside of the img
[14:01:33] <Velveeta> outside of the image where?
[14:01:43] <Velveeta> when it comes to css, you need to be detailed in your description
[14:01:59] <Velveeta> that's the difference between inline-block or float or relative/absolute positioning or whatever
[14:02:08] <WeiJunLi> Velveeta: under the title
[14:02:22] <WeiJunLi> the title -> inside the img but in the bottom just like it is
[14:02:25] <Velveeta> so the title should be where, over the image, positioned at the bottom?
[14:02:40] <Velveeta> and the subtitle under the image, butted up against it?
[14:02:48] <WeiJunLi> yes
[14:02:53] <WeiJunLi> try make something to see if you got the idea
[14:02:58] <WeiJunLi> if you dont will try be more clear
[14:06:50] <Velveeta> something like this could work: http://jsfiddle.net/2vcnbnkh/4/
[14:10:43] <WeiJunLi> Velveeta: seems jsfiddle isnt saving the updates, can you repaste it to jsbin or something else please
[14:10:53] <WeiJunLi> I am still receiving the old version
[14:10:59] <Velveeta> doh, sorry, i pasted you the url to the old version
[14:11:02] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/2vcnbnkh/5/
[14:11:47] <Velveeta> it's still not an ideal solution, but it's a minimal-impact one.. the only changes made were to the #text-box styling
[14:12:05] <WeiJunLi> Velveeta: yes like this, but try to write a big text in the title it doesnt fit
[14:12:40] <Velveeta> well yeah, you won't get that without modifying the markup itself
[14:12:58] <WeiJunLi> Velveeta: when you say markup what do you mean?
[14:13:03] <Velveeta> i mean the html itself
[14:13:04] <robertmaxrees> html
[14:13:26] <Velveeta> you'd want to wrap a relatively-positioned div around the image itself, and then absolutely position the title to the bottom of that container, and outside of that container, put your subtitle element
[14:14:16] <WeiJunLi> Velveeta: yes but I got a container for the img, title and subtitle.
[14:16:21] <WeiJunLi> Velveeta: your example wouldnt fit on a template, you just tried several times till the #text-box fit on the img by changing the margin-left
[14:16:34] <Velveeta> i realize that, but the way this markup is currently structured, what you want to do is non-trivial
[14:16:43] <Velveeta> i can modify the markup easily
[14:18:46] <WeiJunLi> Velveeta: yes please
[14:19:10] <automin> what's the best jquery plugin that fires an event when a dom element enters the viewport?
[14:19:26] <robertmaxrees> automin err, none?
[14:19:44] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[14:20:13] <automin> robertmaxrees: find out when the user scrolls vertically/horizontally so that an image is in viewport, and load it
[14:20:32] <robertmaxrees> automin you can do that yourself.
[14:20:37] <NoiseEee> http://www.benknowscode.com/2013/07/detect-dom-element-scrolled-with-jquery.html @ automin
[14:20:54] <robertmaxrees> or look for an image lazy loading script.
[14:21:41] <ggdevelop> hi, I want to get content from some web page, to my local page and display it. I using ajax but didnt success , can some one help me?
[14:22:14] <robertmaxrees> ggdevelop ajax or an iframe.
[14:22:29] <robertmaxrees> if the other side doesn't allow CORS, you're SOL without a server-side solution.
[14:22:51] <automin> robertmaxrees: NoiseEee this looks good, thanks. i don't want a lazyloader because i need to change state on the event. looks like this will work.
[14:24:13] <robertmaxrees> kind of lost about what all is going on, but cool.
[14:24:43] <ggdevelop> robertmaxrees: ajax .. here is what im tring to do : gggg
[14:24:53] <ggdevelop> http://jsfiddle.net/vct8o7sa/
[14:25:37] <robertmaxrees> ggdevelop they won't allow you to do that,.
[14:26:00] <robertmaxrees> look at your console
[14:26:26] <Velveeta> ok weijunli, try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/2vcnbnkh/8/
[14:26:33] <afidegnum> hi. I am finding hard to workit out.
[14:26:37] <afidegnum> what should I put in hte fiddle?
[14:26:50] <robertmaxrees> the relevant html, css, and javascript.
[14:26:51] <afidegnum> I pasted the sample code and run but there was no output
[14:26:56] <Velveeta> i removed some of the extra wrapping elements, reorganized it slightly, and modified your css to match
[14:27:34] <afidegnum> robertmaxrees: should I extract them from the current page?
[14:27:43] <robertmaxrees> only the relevant parts, sure.
[14:28:01] <WeiJunLi> Velveeta: will try to implement it directly on my proj, thanks
[14:28:08] <Velveeta> no problemo
[14:28:18] <ggdevelop> robertmaxrees: i lookes at the console in network and it show status code 302 found, what dose it means? and why can't I do so?
[14:28:30] <robertmaxrees> ggdevelop not that part.
[14:29:07] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/FFcAyxc.png
[14:29:17] <robertmaxrees> flickr does not allow CORS.
[14:29:24] <Velveeta> fiddle*
[14:29:31] <Velveeta> oh wait, i see what you're saying
[14:29:34] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:30:00] <Velveeta> is he trying to load pictures of your mom?
[14:30:09] <Velveeta> ?sort=relevance&text=mom
[14:31:11] <robertmaxrees> ggdevelop lol
[14:31:15] <robertmaxrees> pick a room ;)
[14:31:28] <afidegnum> robertmaxrees: is not working out, all hte html and jscript are in one file,
[14:31:49] <_r0m3> <robertmaxrees> there should be a given element that exists when it's blank that gets populated with children.
[14:31:50] <afidegnum> this is about 5 jquey sorces plus internal jquery code
[14:32:00] <_r0m3> i can't believe it was that simple!
[14:32:00] <robertmaxrees> _r0m3 that was an assumption.
[14:32:03] <afidegnum> I am finding hard extracting the elements one by one
[14:32:05] <_r0m3> you were right!
[14:32:09] <robertmaxrees> hah, baller.
[14:32:30] <_r0m3> as soon as i made a mark on the element, it created input children
[14:32:46] <robertmaxrees> afidegnum you it shouldn't be that hard.
[14:32:53] <_r0m3> and i simply set the js to check if those children exist
[14:33:02] <_r0m3> voila, the form now validates on ie8 :)
[14:33:11] <_r0m3> thanks, bud!
[14:33:37] <robertmaxrees> add jquery via the dropdown in the upper left, add your plugin via the external resources, put in some minimal html for your form, and your relevant JS.
[14:33:38] <afidegnum> can you pls assist? here is the link
[14:33:41] <afidegnum> http://www.illuztrate.com/comment/reply/16/10#edit-comment-body
[14:33:57] <afidegnum> and what I need to work on is #edit-comment-body
[14:33:58] <robertmaxrees> afidegnum i don't know what you're trying to do, so it's up to you to make the fiddle.
[14:34:21] <afidegnum> I want to close all comments form by default except the one at the top
[14:34:47] <WeiJunLi> Velveeta: I found another issue, open the console and see what happens to the sidebar, how to fix that?
[14:35:08] <afidegnum> robertmaxrees: the comment session is located at the bottom of http://www.illuztrate.com/steps/step-step-ubuntu-installation
[14:35:18] <robertmaxrees> afidegnum i'm still looking for a minimal example.
[14:35:24] <Velveeta> weijunlin: nothing happens on my screen
[14:35:27] <afidegnum> ok
[14:35:48] <mouse-_> gh lol
[14:36:14] <robertmaxrees> i don't know where to start, and i don't want to wade through all of your stuff to figure out what you're trying to do.  that's why we ask for a minimal example in the first place :)
[14:36:20] <afidegnum> I think there must be some (show)/(hide)  somewhere I am finding hard to lcoate
[14:36:24] <afidegnum> locate
[14:36:48] <Velveeta> right, typically the problem falls into a range of a few lines, so giving us an entire page with hundreds of lines of js or more, and saying "right there" is not helpful
[14:36:56] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[14:37:27] <Velveeta> which is why you need to be able to make a minimal example that includes just the code you're having an issue with, and just the markup to go along with it, so we don't have to dig through hundreds of lines to find the 1 that's going wrong
[14:37:39] <afidegnum> yea, I understand but cutting the code is braking the page apart
[14:37:56] <robertmaxrees> afidegnum then add the relevant bits to your fiddle :)
[14:38:22] <dmsuperman> that should really only be true if you're cutting it at the wrong places and indicates you probably need to learn your code better. as a side effect you'll probably find the answer to your own problem while you dig into it
[14:38:23] <Velveeta> right, you want to make it as slim as possible while still being functional, if that means you have to copy a little more to make it work, then do that, but it shouldn't take 100% of the code in that page
[14:38:48] <robertmaxrees> i love this channel today.
[14:39:38] <cyphase> how can i select an element based on the contents of a child element? specifically, i want to select a tr based on the contents of it's child th (for the purpose of hiding the tr)
[14:39:59] <dmsuperman> I would highly suggest not using the contents for that reason
[14:40:03] <dmsuperman> that's what attributes are for :)
[14:40:17] <robertmaxrees> cyphase there's :contains(), but it's going to be much faster to select the specific element and doing a .closest() to find the relevant parent.
[14:40:20] <WeiJunLi> Velveeta: it doesnt work properly directly on my code, use the first code I sent to you and open the console and see what happens to the sidebar with that code
[14:40:29] <Velveeta> cyphase: you can try this: http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[14:40:37] <Velveeta> it's case-sensitive btw, if i remember correctly
[14:40:40] <robertmaxrees> WeiJunLi you're still offtopic.  please take it to #css
[14:41:55] <Velveeta> weijunli: i'm telling you that nothing happens in my window when i open the console... probably because i'm on a large monitor, but i've tried dragging it in and out to see if that made a difference... this is the kind of thing a screenshot would be perfect for, but robertmaxrees has a point... i helped you with the first css issue, but this isn't a css channel, so i don't want to troubleshoot css problem after problem
[14:42:03] <cyphase> dmsuperman, robertmaxrees, i don't (think i) have any other choice in this instance; i don't have control over the page contents. plus performance is not a big issue in this particular case
[14:42:46] <robertmaxrees> cyphase do small things now to prevent issues later.  select the specific element and use .closest() instead of a contains selector.  it'll have a real impact.
[14:42:48] <robertmaxrees> trust me :)
[14:42:55] <Velveeta> ^^ that
[14:43:27] <afidegnum> I am still at a loss
[14:43:51] <cyphase> robertmaxrees, there's nothing to distinguish the element except the contents of the th, and i don't control the page contents
[14:44:12] <robertmaxrees> cyphase what contents of the TH are you looking for?
[14:44:56] <cyphase> robertmaxrees, what do you mean?
[14:45:36] <robertmaxrees> TH elements have children.
[14:45:52] <robertmaxrees> usually.  can you give us more details about what you're trying to do?
[14:45:57] <Velveeta> afidegnum: look at this script list, and the size of the scrollbar handle: http://i.imgur.com/qrdPeZb.png ... there's no way we can be expected to scrape through that to find the problem... if you can't find a way to narrow the scope, we're not gonna be able to do anything to help
[14:46:26] <Velveeta> cyphase: how many rows of th's do you have? is this multiple tables, or is it multiple rows of th's within a single table?
[14:46:43] <robertmaxrees> an example fo what you're doing would be helpful.
[14:47:01] <afidegnum> Velveeta: how did you get those?
[14:47:21] <bdonnhue> hey veryone im using https://github.com/handsontable/
[14:47:25] <Velveeta> i opened up my devtools and took a screenshot...
[14:47:34] <bdonnhue> im trying to figure out how to bind an event handler to a cell when it changes
[14:47:43] <bdonnhue> can anyone help or offer advice for this problem?
[14:48:17] <robertmaxrees> bdonnhue you're using what?
[14:48:28] <robertmaxrees> bdonnhue that link goes to an org.
[14:48:32] <avi__> bdonnhue: naively you use setInterval and pole it
[14:48:38] <bdonnhue> "https://github.com/handsontable/jquery-handsontable"
[14:48:56] <robertmaxrees> bdonnhue are the cells inputs?
[14:49:07] <bdonnhue> i think so
[14:49:08] <avi__> bdonnhue: https://github.com/handsontable/jquery-handsontable/wiki/Events it says right there at the start
[14:49:13] <bdonnhue> i think the td has a textarea
[14:49:15] <avi__> bdonnhue: afterChange
[14:49:18] <Velveeta> does that plugin broadcast any events when a cell changes?
[14:49:42] <afidegnum> Velveeta: what devtools do you use?
[14:49:43] <robertmaxrees> ^ look at the events from the docs.
[14:49:52] <Velveeta> afidegnum: chrome devtools..
[14:49:58] <robertmaxrees> those aren't events.
[14:50:35] <Velveeta> not events, but callbacks that can be bound up
[14:50:41] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[14:50:44] <bdonnhue> im looking at the page. thanks for pointing me there. im having trouble understanding what it is doing
[14:50:46] <Velveeta> you can use the example in the 2nd block, at the end of it
[14:50:47] <robertmaxrees> should be good enough at this case.
[14:51:02] <Velveeta> $('#example2').handsontable('getInstance').addHook('afterChange', callback)
[14:51:03] <avi__> bdonnhue: it's a call back. Basically a function that is called when something changes
[14:51:37] <paul_irish> that's a lot of javascript.
[14:51:50] <Velveeta> holy crap, is that actually paul_irish?
[14:51:54] <paul_irish> in afidegnum's screenshot
[14:51:58] <paul_irish> yah. hi hi
[14:52:12] * Velveeta chokes down hero worship and plays it cool.
[14:52:13] <robertmaxrees> haha i had my fanboy moment a few weeks ago.
[14:52:17] <paul_irish> i have a highlight on "devtools" so you pinged me, Velveeta ;)
[14:52:23] <Velveeta> lol, woo hoo!
[14:52:41] <Velveeta> well, while i have you here for just a moment
[14:52:44] <paul_irish> hit me
[14:53:04] <clov3r> afig
[14:53:15] <Velveeta> how the hell do you stay so bleeding edge on N number of topics? i have a hard time even staying up with a fraction of them... is it just superior time management, or some kind of brain implant, or what?
[14:53:49] <robertmaxrees> something tells me it partially has to do with his job and connections.
[14:54:02] <Velveeta> well yeah, i'm sure being at the center of google has its perks :D
[14:54:03] <robertmaxrees> and partially because he's a smart dude :)
[14:54:26] <Velveeta> but still, this facet of technology is so explosive with material these days
[14:54:31] <snover> lots of amphetamines
[14:54:38] <paul_irish> Velveeta: oh i suck at a lot of them
[14:54:44] <snover> who needs teeth when you can never sleep again
[14:55:07] <Velveeta> snover: all the baseboards in your house will be sparkling clean though
[14:55:08] <paul_irish> its definitely not time mgmt
[14:55:10] <paul_irish> i'm bad at that, too. :)
[14:55:15] <Velveeta> well crap
[14:55:45] <paul_irish> but its good to be socially oriented with everyone that's moving things forward
[14:55:50] <paul_irish> and contributing where possible
[14:57:09] <Velveeta> well then, i'll just keep chewing up code until google scoops me up
[14:59:15] <paul_irish> k cool.
[14:59:31] <robertmaxrees> paul_irish++ a solid dude
[14:59:39] <paul_irish> Velveeta: you're lindsey?
[14:59:53] <Velveeta> if you mean last names, yep
[14:59:58] <paul_irish> groovy
[15:00:44] <paul_irish> google is hiring fwiw
[15:01:05] <robertmaxrees> aren't they in a spree at the moment?
[15:01:28] <Velveeta> damn.. they have an austin office too, huh
[15:01:30] * paul_irish shrug
[15:01:41] <paul_irish> i just see the activity in the teams close to me
[15:01:42] <Velveeta> no clue what they do in the office here though
[15:01:47] <paul_irish> Velveeta: i dont think they do eng
[15:01:54] <Velveeta> yeah i don't think so either
[15:02:17] <paul_irish> bummer because there are too many talented devs in austin
[15:02:29] <paul_irish> can't let BV just consume them all
[15:02:33] <Velveeta> i'm at the advisory board, and we're a cesspool of talented front end devs
[15:02:48] <Velveeta> yeah, i know BV has a reputation for churning them out too
[15:02:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah, kind of surprising they're not doing anything with the talent down there.
[15:04:00] <Velveeta> i've considered the big google campus at some point in the future, but the cost of living difference is insane
[15:05:32] <robertmaxrees> It'd take quite a bit for me to consider moving away from my current place.
[15:05:32] <Velveeta> ok, it's time for me to hit the bar.. it's draft day here in our designer/fee FF league, and i have dreams to crush
[15:05:43] <robertmaxrees> good times.  get you some of that
[15:05:54] <Velveeta> yeah, i really do love austin, but i'm kinda ready for a change... in a few years...
[15:05:58] <robertmaxrees> hah
[15:05:58] <Velveeta> right now vegas is our front-runner :D
[15:07:33] <_r0m3> my hometown :)
[15:11:27] <bdonnhue> https://github.com/handsontable/jquery-handsontable/wiki/Events
[15:11:29] <_r0m3> ...where it's 100-degrees at midnight
[15:11:41] <bdonnhue> can anyone explain how the before/afterChange events are used?
[15:11:50] <bdonnhue> **afterValidate
[15:11:57] <bdonnhue> I got the change working
[15:12:59] <robertmaxrees> bdonnhue not sure what you're asking.
[15:13:02] <fschuindt> guys, anyone knows a tool for populate extensive forms to use in tests?
[15:14:11] <bdonnhue> so what I am trying to do is validate cell input. Im trying to figure out how to get the cell row/column number
[15:14:26] <bdonnhue> it looks like the afterValidate or before validate might enable me to do this
[15:14:38] <bdonnhue> but im not sure how to use them nor if there is a metter more common way to do this?
[15:15:26] <robertmaxrees> bdonnhue those methods both toss out the row number it looks like.
[15:16:11] <dmsuperman> cyphase: it's not just the performance, it's very bug prone. what if the formatting changes. what if the wording changes. what if HTML is introduced that breaks the selector. What if your selector is based on a certain encoding and doesn't work in certain browsers. etc. the attribute will make the code much more resiliant
[15:16:31] <robertmaxrees> classes are a great thing :)
[15:16:48] <paul_irish> fschuindt: Faker
[15:19:41] * juvenis is away: auto-away

[16:18:39] <Fall> :/
[16:19:47] <robert0> \:
[16:20:14] <yeukhon> i returned a deferred. http://dpaste.com/1A562DK  but when runSolution's ajax calls rejects, unless i manually do d.reject() in the failure in p.then, the rejection won't bubble. is this supposed to hapen? i can't remember if the A+ spec can do that?
[16:24:11] <robertmaxrees> A+ and jquery promises are different.
[16:27:46] <Velveeta> plus, you have 2 disconnected promises there
[16:28:02] <Velveeta> $.ajax creates its own, and you're manually creating another, which means you have to manually specify the resolution/rejection criteria
[16:28:45] <tcpman> Who can see the problem in my code, and why my function wont read the text value and switch case?? http://pastebin.com/MyfSWFip
[16:29:12] <robertmaxrees> can you use something like fixee instead?
[16:29:36] <robertmaxrees> that file is triggering their spam protection and forcing a captcha
[16:30:42] <yeukhon> Velveeta:  yeah i see. so there is no point creating that extra deferred i guess unless im doing something heavy in between
[16:33:02] <Velveeta> yeah, if you're just trying to tie callbacks to ajax success/failure, you can just return $.ajax(options);
[16:33:19] <Velveeta> $.ajax will return a promise, which your return statement will just pass along to the caller
[16:34:00] <yeukhon> yeah thanks! probably overthinking something at that point.
[17:05:01] <K3|Chris> http://i.imgur.com/KaDcgZ3.png landing without looking out a window or  chase camera is weirdly satisfying
[17:05:08] <K3|Chris> disregard, wrong chan
[18:37:13] <stef1a> riddle me this, jquery experts: https://gist.github.com/smlance/6932c48e73dc93e5ca23 why does the commented-out js segment there only work in the top position rather than the bottom?
[18:44:57] <BillCriswell> stef1a: Not sure I'm following.
[18:45:10] <BillCriswell> stef1a: Are you asking why commented out code doesn't run?
[18:45:19] <stef1a> no
[18:45:28] <stef1a> the code that _is_ commented out is the code in question, though
[18:45:39] <BillCriswell> Oh I see now.
[18:45:44] <stef1a> i wonder why, if i put it at the bottom of that file, it does not run; but if i put it above, it does run
[18:46:03] <stef1a> the commented-out part is just there to show the two positions within the code of the segment i'm comparing
[18:47:04] <BillCriswell> Do you have the HTMl anywhere?
[18:49:38] <stef1a> yes, let me grab it
[18:50:56] <stef1a> BillCriswell: https://gist.github.com/smlance/6932c48e73dc93e5ca23
[18:54:07] <shoky> stef1a: have you checked your console for errors
[18:56:32] <stef1a> shoky: good catch; there is indeed a JS error on the page in question :-)
[18:56:47] <stef1a> and it occurs before the jquery placed at the bottom
[18:56:53] <shoky> yups
[20:02:51] <jeffreylevesque> if i nest an '.on' method within another, and create a <div> within the nested method, will the parent '.on()' have scope to remove the <div>?
[21:16:48] <igcewieling> I'm still somewhat of a n00b.  I'm trying to find the 'children of the nearest next sibling which has class .squeezebox'.     I tred content = $(this).next().children().first('.squeezebox'); console.log(content.id()); but it looks like whatever that matched it did not have an ID.  The element I'm looking for has an ID.   Is there anything obviously wrong with my selector?.
[21:50:11] <afidegnum> hi, I am trying to apply this function to the page $(".comment li.comment-reply a").closest('.comment').find('.comment-form').hide();
[21:50:17] <afidegnum> but it's not responding
[21:50:38] <afidegnum> here is the url of the page     http://www.illuztrate.com/steps/step-step-ubuntu-installation
[21:50:49] <afidegnum> can you please give hand?
[22:14:37] <litropy> I set var myvar = 'mytext'; then, I $( ".myclass h3" ).html( myvar ); and on my desktop browser, I get mytext, yet on chrome on android, I get 90.
[22:16:32] <litropy> Same for stock browser.
[23:10:54] <Cork> litropy: are you sure it isn't something happening from another line?
[23:11:09] <Cork> and have you checked that content is actually in that variable when you get 90?
[23:11:19] <Cork> cause that problem doesn't make sense
[23:12:25] <litropy> Cork, I know. It's pretty screwed. I can't tell because I'm on my phone (no console), but it's within an if/else statement, and it's definitely going else when it should go if.
[23:12:40] <Cork> litropy: try an alert(myvar)
[23:12:42] <litropy> Because my site is responding in that way.
[23:12:59] <Cork> also you on android you can access developer tools from abp
[23:14:23] <litropy> Cork, yep. 90.
[23:14:44] <Cork> so check where that variable gets its contents
[23:15:33] <hex20dec> Is it possible to see any response headers via js/jq(not the browser's inspector) when using CORS?
[23:16:48] <litropy> Cork, I set it globally to null, then I have a switch case for a div that spans the entire page for responsive design, and in the case that it's horizontal, I set orientation = 'horizontal' and that's my var.
[23:17:17] <Cork> litropy: well something sets it to something else :)
[23:17:26] <Cork> global vars is a bit risky for this reason
[23:17:35] <litropy> Cork, I know. Only on Android browser. So odd.
[23:17:48] <litropy> And Chrome
[23:17:52] <Cork> normally scoping the functions needing access and doing it "locally" to that scope is often a better idea
[23:17:53] <litropy> for android.
[23:18:25] <litropy> Cork, I hear ya.
[23:18:41] <Cork> hex20dec: jqxhr.getResponseHeader() is what is exposed to js
[23:19:28] <hex20dec> Cork: But when using CORS, I see a blank string when I call that.
[23:20:21] <Cork> hex20dec: then js blocks the headers
[23:20:34] <Cork> that is the interface, nothing more nothing less
[23:21:05] <Cork> sorry then those headears are blocked from js not by js
[23:22:35] <santhosh_> hi
[23:22:46] <litropy> I just worked around it. I can't believe I just blew like an hour when I could have tossed out my problem with a short line of code. Jesus, I must be tired.
[23:25:02] <santhosh_> hello
[23:25:14] <Cork> ?ask @ santhosh_
[23:25:14] <b-ot> santhosh_: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[23:26:32] <santhosh_> am new to jquery, so wat u guys suggest me to my learning robust
[23:26:48] <santhosh_> jquery
[23:28:18] <santhosh_> just going through the tutorials in jquery,com wud be sufficient enough or any other sugeestions?
[23:28:37] <Cork> http://learn.jquery.com http://www.tutorialspoint.com/jquery/ is two good staring points
[23:28:51] <m4Aark> anyone know if i can add a dynamic row to table with jquery
[23:29:06] <Cork> santhosh_: also you should make sure you know css and html basics well
[23:29:17] <Cork> even before starting those tutorials
[23:29:31] <Cork> m4Aark: sure you can
[23:29:33] <santhosh_> right, thanks very much
[23:30:27] <Cork> m4Aark: but please explain what is causing you problem a bit
[23:48:58] <litropy> Cork, I figured it out. Some lib must be using the var orientation. Maybe JQ itself.
[23:54:40] <jop008> if I go 4 divs up I reach my element but I want only elements that have data-type = autocomplete
[23:54:53] <jop008> Quick shorthand possible?
[23:56:22] <sacho> your question doesn't make sense.
[23:57:04] <sacho> Demonstrate what you're doing, and how it's different from what you want to do.
