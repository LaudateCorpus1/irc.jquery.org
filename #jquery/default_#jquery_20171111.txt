[11:14:58] <KnightsOfNi> Is there anything wrong with using the body element for event delegation? Eg when you have a lot of dynamically loaded content, is it fine to do $('body').on(event, element,...) for almost everything?
[11:20:32] <GrandMoffTarkin> hi i am trying to infuse the hover via Chrome inspect element, but it does not have any effect, these are for the thumb images where it shows a bigger image on mouseover   URL http://bit.ly/2ACgEgE
[12:13:59] <gonssal> KnightsOfNi: I'd recommend using $(document) instead
[12:16:06] <gonssal> KnightsOfNi: also, whatever you use, I recommend assigning it to a variable first ($doc = $(document))
[14:17:15] <MaxLeiter> gonssal why do you say that?
[14:17:19] <MaxLeiter> Curious not questioning
