[05:25:09] <linux_daemon> hello everyone, i know this is not the official channel for gulp, but i have gulpfile.js and when i run: gulp build, the build passes, but when i open the localhost, i get: CONNECTION REFUSED on the assets. can anyone point me to a probable solution to this?
[11:04:28] <robertparkerx> something is changing a select selected value and I can't find what
[11:04:43] <robertparkerx> I tried to use $('#ID').val() but it gets switched
[11:10:02] <robertparkerx> I got it
[11:10:10] <robertparkerx> I had to initiate (change)
[14:12:50] <braindead_> i want to hide a .class when another .class2 is in viewport. it seems like jquery has a visible function that could solve this easily but i cant make it work. does one know a good example code to hide an element when a class is in viewport?
[14:13:31] <robertmaxrees> visible isn't the right tool for this - that just tells you whether or not the element could be seen, not if it's in viewport.
[14:14:07] <braindead_> ok, thank you
[14:14:16] <robertmaxrees> when you say "in viewport" are you talking about checking when the user scrolls, or something else?
[14:15:12] <braindead_> yes. it is a button that should be seen until the user is on a specific section on the page. than it should hide. after the section is not on the screen anymore, the button should appear again
[14:15:42] <braindead_> maybe this? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView
[14:16:16] <braindead_> but its not working on safari ios
[14:16:28] <robertmaxrees> right.  you'll need to use a scroll listener.
[14:16:44] <robertmaxrees> there are also plugins to handle stuff like this.  could run a quick google search.
[14:17:56] <braindead_> wouldn't that be something "basic" that could be done with a couple of lines normally?
[14:18:34] <robertmaxrees> semi-basic.  you'll need to debounce/throttle the function and make sure you cache your selectors outside of it.
[14:18:47] <robertmaxrees> otherwise your page performance will drop.
[14:20:24] <braindead_> that already sounds more complicated than what i expected :)
[14:20:41] <robertmaxrees> :) they're really not too bad.  just a little more work.
[14:21:59] <braindead_> you don't happen to have an example you could point me too
[14:23:06] <robertmaxrees> of what?
[14:23:38] <robertmaxrees> the whole thing?  not really.  pretty simple to wire up though.
[14:24:34] <robertmaxrees> we could help you do it, even :)
[14:24:45] <braindead_> what scroll listener would you recommend?
[14:24:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:25:08] <robertmaxrees> jquery makes binding event listeners pretty straightforward, hence my confusion.
[14:25:51] <braindead_> ok, i will try to fiddle something
[14:25:58] <braindead_> i should use element.scrollIntoView(); right?
[14:26:02] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:26:29] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to calculate the element's offset and then compare to the current window's scroll position and height.
[14:27:28] <robertmaxrees> depending on the level of control you need, rather, scrollIntoView may or may not serve your purposes.
[14:29:21] <braindead_> ok, I think this is something for tomorrow
[14:30:18] <braindead_> thank you for your insights robertmaxrees. I will look more into the topic first
