[00:39:57] <Unopoo> `$('#dictionary').load('exercises-content.html body');`
[00:39:57] <Unopoo> is this any wrong?
[00:39:57] <Unopoo> I want to load `exercises-content.html`(which with full html structure)'s body's content to current file; if I do above, nothing loaded, so , is above any wrong?
[00:41:05] <Woet> Unopoo: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[00:41:31] <Woet> wait, my bad
[00:41:47] <Woet> "jQuery uses the browser's .innerHTML property to parse the retrieved document and insert it into the current document. During this process, browsers often filter elements from the document such as <html>, <title>, or <head> elements. As a result, the elements retrieved by .load() may not be exactly the same as if the document were retrieved directly by the browser."
[00:41:49] <Woet> might be related.
[00:46:12] <Unopoo> Woet: it didn't metion <body>
[00:46:21] <Unopoo> but maybe we should assume that?
[00:46:53] <Woet> it says "such as"
[00:47:00] <Woet> so that implies there are more
[00:47:09] <Unopoo> Woet: okay, thx :)
[01:27:32] <Unopoo> why using on('hover', selector, callback) doesn't work? while on('mouseenter', selector, callback) can?
[01:44:10] <Oka> Unopoo: Which version of jQuery are you using?
[01:44:43] <Unopoo> 1.9.0
[01:45:15] <Oka> Deprecated in jQuery 1.8, removed in 1.9: The name "hover" used as a shorthand for the string "mouseenter mouseleave". It attaches a single event handler for those two events, and the handler must examine event.type to determine whether the event is mouseenter or mouseleave. Do not confuse the "hover" pseudo-event-name with the .hover() method, which accepts one or two functions.
[01:45:28] <Oka> Proper: http://jsfiddle.net/Oka/cew677kr/1/
[01:47:03] <CrowX-> Cork, are you there?
[01:49:51] <Unopoo> Oka: thx very much, don't know why , I always miss the right point of the documentation..
[01:55:22] <wa5ted> CrowX-: whats up, hes probably asleep
[01:56:05] <wa5ted> Oka: i love deprecated stuff, makes me feel like ive been using juqery for too long
[01:57:26] <wa5ted> juqery*
[01:57:29] <wa5ted> jquery*
[02:10:09] <Oka> Mmm.
[02:12:13] <CrowX-> wa5ted, are you a professional web developer? with a job in the field I mean
[02:13:06] <wa5ted> CrowX-: im a freelancer with enough exp that qualifies me to call myself a dev, if you need a protfolio i can give you a few links to chekc my work out, but in anycase whats up
[02:17:05] <CrowX-> wa5ted, well, I was interested if there are any webdev jobs in which a person doesn't have to use photoshop/adobe illustrator, or anything image-editing related, or Windows even
[02:17:27] <wa5ted> lol you are looking for a job?
[02:17:41] <CrowX-> no, I'm interested if there are such jobs
[02:18:18] <CrowX-> cause I got at this job whose title was "php webdev", in which I did both frontend and backend, and I came to really hate it because of the images editing, and having to use windows
[02:18:35] <CrowX-> like, are there any webdev jobs in which programming is the only requirement?
[02:18:46] <wa5ted> you are looking at being a backend dev strictly
[02:18:49] <wa5ted> there are such
[02:18:59] <wa5ted> but youd have to go full tilt and become a backend admin
[02:19:07] <CrowX-> tilt?
[02:19:13] <CrowX-> oh nvm
[02:19:15] <wa5ted> unless its a big enough company where duties are limited because there are so many people
[02:21:32] <CrowX-> wa5ted, so you do front end only?
[02:22:18] <wa5ted> CrowX-: well.... :)
[02:22:22] <wa5ted> i do both ends
[02:22:24] <wa5ted> tbh
[02:22:29] <wa5ted> but focus on front end these days
[02:22:39] <wa5ted> my php and mysql stuff is rusty at best
[02:23:16] <CrowX-> so you cut/edit a lot of images I get, eh?
[02:23:26] <wa5ted> for frontend
[02:23:27] <wa5ted> for stuff
[02:23:29] <wa5ted> yup
[02:23:37] <wa5ted> dont deal with too much image processing on the backend
[02:23:48] <wa5ted> as i said i have focused on frontend in recent time
[02:25:04] <CrowX-> what do you do when a client requires everything to be like the psd, but the webfont doesn't match the original font, and you have to use lots of spans with letter-spacing to make the site look exactly like the psd? Doesn't it give you a bad taste in the mouth?
[02:25:41] <wa5ted> it does true, but then again i try to design my psd so that they look good and are functional
[02:26:24] <CrowX-> ah, so you can design too. that's cool
[02:27:24] <CrowX-> the only part of my webdev job I liked was the javascript programming
[02:27:56] <wa5ted> CrowX-: yup javascript is fun
[02:28:07] <wa5ted> but i dont like when its used for overkill
[02:28:18] <CrowX-> same
[02:28:27] <wa5ted> example: material design for bootstrap, god is it annoying
[02:28:45] <wa5ted> wit hthat set of js so that where ever you click on a button the highlight starts from there and spreads out
[02:28:49] <wa5ted> its fucking annoying
[04:27:25] <juro> Hi, I am struggling to access an element inside a on() and .get() call like so: http://jsfiddle.net/aeom7s9e/ - it's probably a quick fix, but I just cannot see it
[04:39:01] <wa5ted> juro: what shte intended ehaviour
[04:39:08] <wa5ted> cause hwen i click test me i get great
[04:43:40] <juro> waSted, it should replace the clicked a element with "All done"
[04:45:28] <wa5ted> well first of all i dont see a "All done" line
[04:45:36] <wa5ted> and if it is pulling form the somewhere.html
[04:45:50] <wa5ted> it wont be possible unless you have somewhere.html hosted somehwere for the fiddle
[04:45:54] <wa5ted> juro: ^
[04:47:33] <juro> wa5ted, yes, I understand that I cannot actually run the .get, but even if I do, line 4 of the javascript cannot access the a element
[04:47:54] <wa5ted> yup
[04:48:04] <wa5ted> and tbh i have no interest in running a solution locally
[04:48:19] <wa5ted> unless you can get the fiddle to point to somewhere.html
[04:48:25] <wa5ted> which im guessing where All done is
[04:48:30] <wa5ted> juro: ^
[04:49:23] <juro> wa5ted, thank you for your time.
[04:49:53] <wa5ted> juro: sure, doesnt seem like i help, i mean ill help but you gotta ge that somewhere.html thingy working
[04:50:53] <juro> Yeah, only for the fiddle - the problem seems to be accessing the originally clicked a elemen, I jat added an id to it .... not very elegant, but it works
[04:53:56] <wa5ted> kk
[05:57:44] <greengriminal> Hey, so I am using jQuery sortable as a grid which allows me to rearrange some portfolio projects, I store the order of the portfolios in localStorage which works great.
[05:58:24] <greengriminal> However if i want to permanently change the order that would involve me having to make some form of persistance call to the database right?
[06:01:24] <Guest78610> hi i want to add a ui element which would log some alert messages... what ui element do you recommend in this case?
[06:04:15] <wa5ted> greengriminal: i dont get whatyu are trying todo
[06:04:30] <wa5ted> and if you are sohwing ortfolio projects
[06:04:40] <wa5ted> i doubt jquery sortables would be the right way to go
[06:04:55] <wa5ted> Guest78610: its not the ui element that matter
[06:05:05] <wa5ted> a simple div will suffice
[06:05:13] <Guest78610> what about a list box?
[06:05:25] <Guest78610> the alert messages com from the webserver
[06:05:31] <Guest78610> and i just want to display it
[06:05:46] <greengriminal> wa5ted: I allow some users to set an order of their portfolios by using jQuery sortable right and then on change it would write to the database and update it.
[06:06:04] <wa5ted> yup
[06:06:11] <wa5ted> thats correct
[06:06:21] <wa5ted> oooohhh for a sec i thought this was for your site
[06:06:28] <wa5ted> but yes
[06:06:43] <wa5ted> you would have to write to the database on exit
[06:06:47] <wa5ted> but i wouldnt wait for that
[06:06:47] <greengriminal> So inside the $('#some_element).sortable({  update: function(event, ui){ $.ajax({ data: data, type...})}})
[06:06:54] <wa5ted> yup
[06:06:58] <wa5ted> something like that
[06:06:59] <greengriminal> Something along those lines.
[06:07:16] <greengriminal> wa5ted: Right now I am storing the values in localStorage.
[06:07:25] <greengriminal>  It works for now, but isn't really what I am after.
[06:07:56] <greengriminal> Thanks anyways.
[06:08:18] <wa5ted> greengriminal: now hold on what are you after?
[06:08:32] <Guest78610> wa5ted: ?
[06:08:51] <wa5ted> Guest78610: there is no such element
[06:08:54] <wa5ted> just use a plain div
[06:09:15] <Guest78610> wa5ted: can you dynamically add stuff which comes from the webserver?
[06:09:32] <wa5ted> appended to the error div?
[06:09:33] <wa5ted> sure
[06:09:49] <wa5ted> ajax query
[06:10:40] <greengriminal> wa5ted: You change the order of some objects using #sortable but I want to store the order of my objects. I will put a jsFiddle together to quickly explain what i have.
[06:11:48] <Guest78610> wa5ted: can you show an example?
[06:11:59] <wa5ted> Guest78610: not as easy as you think
[06:12:05] <wa5ted> but i can give you some links on what to do
[06:12:18] <wa5ted> im assuming you are querying amysql database using php?
[06:12:24] <wa5ted> greengriminal: not necessary
[06:12:26] <Guest78610> wa5ted: you dont need to write the receive function ...
[06:12:44] <wa5ted> Guest78610: search up $.get and $.post
[06:12:51] <wa5ted> n jquery documentation
[06:13:00] <wa5ted> greengriminal: not necessary
[06:13:00] <Guest78610> wa5ted: i already have a websockets connection implemented and have a receive methode.... which should call a function to add those messages to the div....
[06:13:27] <wa5ted> Guest78610: what ar eyou suing for backend
[06:13:27] <greengriminal> wa5ted: I am using a mysql database using RoR (ruby on rails)
[06:13:49] <Guest78610> wa5ted: can you just show how to those add message to div.. function would look like?
[06:14:29] <wa5ted> greengriminal: no need for a fiddle, order is attainable if you give each item a timestamp and make sure you pull that time stamp
[06:14:37] <wa5ted> that timestamp becomes your id and then you sort by it
[06:14:48] <greengriminal> I was thinking that also
[06:14:58] <wa5ted> Guest78610: i have no idea what sort of backend you are using
[06:15:05] <greengriminal> maybe I could use the timestamp of the object to save the order.
[06:15:22] <wa5ted> greengriminal: im saying use the creation timestamp that is stored in the mysql database
[06:15:30] <wa5ted> provided you created a column for it
[06:15:33] <greengriminal>  wa5ted: Yes i will do that
[06:15:38] <greengriminal> I do have a column for it
[06:15:44] <greengriminal> created_at column
[06:15:45] <Guest78610> wa5ted: go, which communicates via websockets to the javascript
[06:15:56] <wa5ted> greengriminal: tbh im saying use timestamp to avoid creating a unique id
[06:16:03] <greengriminal> Okay
[06:16:04] <greengriminal> thanks
[06:16:28] <Guest78610> wa5ted: as i said i can already receive those messages in javascript... i just want to add those to the div...
[06:16:49] <wa5ted> .append
[06:16:51] <wa5ted> to a div
[06:16:57] <wa5ted> if you already ahve the data incoming
[06:17:06] <wa5ted> if you wanna replace error messages
[06:17:08] <wa5ted> do .html
[06:17:13] <wa5ted> Guest78610: ^
[06:17:14] <Guest78610> wa5ted: i would like to also add a scroll bar to the messages ui...
[06:17:32] <ruben-> I can't find anything about this - but I have some strange behaviour on a site. When I send an Ajax POST request and the HTTP times out - it automatically resends this request to the server. Is there a way to disable this? I added a "beforeSend" for debugging purposes, but this is not repeated.
[06:17:57] <Guest78610> wa5ted: yeah, but can you add a scroll bar as well? why not just using a list box?
[06:20:22] <wa5ted> Guest78610: you know what here http://fezvrasta.github.io/snackbarjs/
[06:20:30] <wa5ted> you asked best way to do it this si the way i feel
[06:21:21] <Guest78610> wa5ted: i might have a lot messages...so i would need a scroll bar
[06:22:13] <wa5ted> well snack bar
[06:22:18] <wa5ted> eliminates the stack i think
[06:22:20] <wa5ted> check it ou
[06:22:22] <wa5ted> its the best i got
[06:22:27] <wa5ted> for showing that sort of thing
[06:23:37] <Guest78610> stack?
[06:25:18] <wa5ted> Guest78610: a pile of objects, typically one that is neatly arranged.
[06:25:30] <wa5ted> go check out how that thing works
[06:25:54] <Guest78610> i might go qith jquerys listbox
[06:26:40] <wa5ted> Guest78610: do what you need to, i just showed you the best looking way to display error messages its the same way that mac does it on their operating system
[06:26:49] <wa5ted> but clearly you have your mind set
[06:26:52] <wa5ted> so good luck :)
[06:28:58] <Guest78610> wa5ted: i dont see how snackbarjs handles lots of error messages
[06:29:42] <wa5ted> Guest78610: let me ask you as a user do you want error messages to stack or to disappate so they dont bother you
[06:30:57] <Guest78610> its not really error messages...more like log info
[06:31:27] <Guest78610> i add them to the list but they should not disappear...
[06:52:47] <Guest78610> why i get an Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier  in the following code? $(document).ready(function() {  initialize(); });
[07:03:10] <wa5ted> Guest78610: initialize() miht be fcalling a statement that is undefined
[07:03:46] <wa5ted> also can suggest too many brackets
[07:10:53] <Guest78610> wa5ted: does jquery work together with d3.js?
[07:11:19] <wa5ted> hold on let me call the devs
[07:11:23] <wa5ted> see what they say
[07:12:59] <wa5ted> Guest78610: they told me to tell you to google it
[07:24:24] <Guest78610> wa5ted: i created a small example: http://jsfiddle.net/z0bvmg2s/
[07:25:56] <wa5ted> andi am to do what with this?
[07:27:00] <Guest78610> it shows what error message is printed
[07:42:45] <Rogerz> @dutch_kazatel hey
[08:25:05] <root3d> hey there,
[08:26:07] <root3d> seems like i totally fucked up >> i just need a hint whether i am using document.ready() http://codepen.io/anon/pen/PwwMvY . i just want a popup on edit button .. any help plz?
[08:30:24] <root3d> anyone ? for the cute cat :)
[08:32:14] <no_gravity> What is a good way to create a DOM node from a string?
[08:32:43] <no_gravity> When you have s="<a href='abc'>test</a>" for example. how do you create a dom element from that?
[08:33:37] <jikuja> What should plugin return if chaining is not supported. Null or something else?
[08:36:22] <no_gravity> jikuja: how about undefined?
[08:36:46] <no_gravity> jikuja: i would not put a return statement. then the returned value is probably undefined.
[08:37:09] <jikuja> What is best option if I want to think about user of the plugin?
[08:37:32] <KrasivyMir> im sorry root3d
[08:37:33] <KrasivyMir> but
[08:37:39] <KrasivyMir> where do you call perform function?
[08:39:07] <jikuja> every tutorial I have read tells only about return this.each() and nothing else:/
[08:41:05] <uwjesq> I am looking for a wow effect for an image. Slitslider looked cool but it is broken so any effect that is not too over used is welcome.
[08:42:32] <jikuja> also I need opinion(s) for following. Currently my pluging supports chaining if ajax is done synchronoysly or ajax is not called at all. Should I just remove chaining support and make code easier to understand? (it has callbacks to make more changes)
[08:47:39] <Guest78610> hi, any idea why the listbox shows up empty? http://jsfiddle.net/san2y62u/
[08:50:14] <Guest78610> i see
[08:51:47] <Expel> Why does my MenuBtn jump to the top every time I press it? It should slide down the menu http://pastebin.com/xkzyPznt
[09:02:48] <KrasivyMir> Guest78610 becouse source its not in the scope of the function initialize
[09:03:36] <root3d> KrasivyMir, thanks for reply .. i am calling perform in document.ready()
[09:03:43] <Guest78610> KrasivyMir: thanks fixed
[09:04:01] <KrasivyMir> :D
[09:04:46] <root3d> KrasivyMir, right.. i just declared it ..not using anywhere .. bad kitty
[09:04:54] <KrasivyMir> hehe
[09:06:38] <root3d> KrasivyMir, https://octodex.github.com/images/grinchtocat.gif
[09:08:32] <KrasivyMir> bad kitty
[09:13:26] <root3d> KrasivyMir, still stuck .. updated code . http://codepen.io/anon/pen/gbpYbO ..
[09:14:00] <root3d> KrasivyMir, i think .. i haven't include jquery.js ..inside codepen ..is that why !
[09:20:08] <root3d> just a hint .
[09:22:46] <KrasivyMir> yes
[09:22:47] <KrasivyMir> "NetworkError: 404 Not Found - http://s.codepen.io/files/common/jquery.min.js"
[09:25:47] <KrasivyMir> you can add it pressing the wheel next to JS
[09:26:11] <KrasivyMir> but then I see this error ReferenceError: weinvest is not defined
[09:26:57] <root3d> KrasivyMir, is javascript blocking in nature..
[09:27:05] <root3d> ?
[09:27:39] <KrasivyMir> i think it is
[09:27:41] <root3d> KrasivyMir, if a variable is not present does that means , it will not execute the later part of it ?
[09:28:27] <KrasivyMir> you have to have the variable in the scope, of the function or globally
[09:28:32] <KrasivyMir> if that's what you are asking
[09:30:32] <root3d> KrasivyMir, i am asking about the code execution in js , is it like python scripting , it will ignore if there is some error and move on what it could execute
[09:31:20] <KrasivyMir> I know for experience, that errors halt the script
[09:31:39] <KrasivyMir> but, I haven't read it anywhere... its just my experience
[09:32:08] <StephenS> Is there a sleep method in jQuery?
[09:32:30] <StephenS> something like sleep() wait() or similar method as in multi-threading?
[09:33:37] <StephenS> hm nvm delay() seems to work.
[09:33:45] <root3d> StephenS, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5722791/wait-or-sleep-function-in-jquery
[09:33:57] <root3d> StephenS, is that what you looking for
[09:42:26] <root3d> KrasivyMir, i am just worried. why just a pop isn't working . updated code . http://codepen.io/anon/pen/gbpYbO
[09:42:38] <root3d> looks like . i am desperate
[09:50:50] <Daghdha> ANyone can suggest a good way to jump to an element in a wide div that has a horizontal scrollbar?
[09:51:23] <Daghdha> I tried using animate and scroll left but when i neared the end it starts jumping back and forth
[10:02:32] <Oka> Daghdha: Can you make a testcase?
[10:04:33] <leporello> Hi. I'm testing parallax or slide site design. It consists of 5 fullscreen divs. But after page refresh when I'm on slide 3 or more it returns not to first slide but to previous.
[10:04:44] <leporello> And scrollTo() doesn't work
[10:06:08] <mooncup> .21
[10:06:19] <Mia> Hey cahnnel, is an operation like $(".class").addClass("anotherClass"); heavy operation with many elements (many > 500)
[10:09:07] <root3d> i am making a custom popup .. on Edit button . seems like there is an object there but not displaying.. what could be wrong ? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/gbpYbO
[10:09:12] <leporello> Mia, just measure. I think not :)
[10:09:32] <Mia> leporello, how can I measure
[10:09:34] <leporello> it should use native function for selection
[10:09:48] <Mia> I mean calling that every second or so, I mean
[10:09:51] <Mia> is that heavy operation
[10:09:56] <root3d> Mia, 500 is too much
[10:10:11] <Mia> rOOb, well I need to style certain type of elements every few secodns
[10:10:17] <Mia> is there an alternative?
[10:10:29] <Mia> I would prefer modifying the actual css rule but I think that's not easily possible
[10:10:31] <leporello> Mia console.time(); $(....) console.timeEnd()
[10:10:31] <root3d> Mia, angularjs
[10:10:38] <Mia> root3d,
[10:11:00] <sacho> root3d, 500 elements is a tiny amount. Angular is not going to magically make modifying 500 elements more performant, anywa.y
[10:11:35] <root3d> sacho, ok. Mia , listen ^
[10:11:58] <Mia> thanks root3d and sacho
[10:12:13] <Mia> (once again sacho ^^ )
[10:12:15] <root3d> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/gbpYbO  anyhelp for custom popup ?
[10:12:36] <Mia> root3d, what do you need help with
[10:13:43] <root3d> Mia, in the code .. in html i have  a template for overview-popup .. on edit click i am calling it to show some data like a dialog box
[10:14:07] <toothrot> mia, why are you doing this?
[10:17:54] <StephenS> "$someobject.animate({fontSize: "20px", color: "red"}, 'fast');" am I doing something wrong?
[10:18:18] <StephenS> According to docs, animate can take two params, and first param can take unlimited params related to css.
[10:18:37] <Mia> toothrot, what do you mean
[10:18:40] <Mia> root3d, checking
[10:19:43] <root3d> Mia, thanks
[10:21:07] <toothrot> mia, what are the 500 elements being updated for?
[10:22:21] <Mia> toothrot, I need a way to change the stype of a certain type of element pretty frequenty
[10:22:42] <Mia> if there is an easier way (like changing the css rule of the element instead of changing the class of ALL elements with a certain style) I would love to know.
[10:23:09] <Mia> root3d, can you simplify it please
[10:23:19] <Mia> too messy right now, en example case would help
[10:24:15] <root3d> Mia, if you click on edit . it say alter() below that is popup . can i cite line number for simplification
[10:25:03] <Daghdha> I am using this for my scrolling, https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-scrollTo/1.4.3/jquery.scrollTo.min.js it works but i can't figure out how to set the margin. Anyone use this scrollTo script also?
[10:25:10] <Mia> root3d, when I click edit I get an alert saying [boject Object]
[10:25:51] <toothrot> mia, you can programmatically add/remove css rules.. not sure what the support is like for it though.
[10:26:21] <Mia> toothrot, yeah that's why maybe I should go with a more known route ^^
[10:26:45] <root3d> Mia, in html line 274 and in js line 94 .. i can't map the popup . am i doing it right
[10:26:54] <toothrot> Mia, instead of changing individual elements, you could change the class on the parent
[10:28:48] <Mia> root3d, it searches for  .txt-overview but your popup has a differnt class maybe? I really don't udnerstand what is going on, can you simplify the case?
[10:28:53] <toothrot> Mia, ...and have a rule set .parentA > whatever , it's a more expensive CSS selector, but probably stll better than changing 500 classes
[10:29:26] <Mia> toothrot, oh that's nice! but the thing is: my items have id's
[10:29:35] * CssNoob good night y'all 2:31am
[10:29:35] <Mia> so actually what I do is an attribute slection (on 500 items)
[10:29:50] <Mia> toothrot, so its not possible to make it like that I beleive right
[10:29:52] <toothrot> Mia, but aren't they all the same elements? or at least have a common class.
[10:30:02] <Mia> toothrot, no they have a common id that's all
[10:30:09] <Mia> I mean, common data-id
[10:30:12] <Mia> (attribute)
[10:30:36] <toothrot> they aren't siblings?
[10:31:02] <Mia> $("[data-id='"+id+"']").addClass("myClass"); is what I really do toothrot
[10:31:21] <toothrot> what's the html look like (roughly)  ?
[10:31:50] <Mia> container > items (with various data-id's)
[10:32:02] <Mia> so they're unordered
[10:32:28] <Mia> they're sent from the server like that.
[10:32:38] <Mia> and I append them on server messages.
[10:32:42] <toothrot> one sec, will show you an example and we can work from there
[10:33:00] <Mia> Oh sure! Would love to. I'm searching for the best way to do this since yesterday toothrot
[10:36:19] <toothrot> Mia, http://jsfiddle.net/zd1dsn9t/
[10:36:33] <Mia> checking toothrot
[10:36:55] <root3d> Mia, thanks. will do tomorrow
[10:37:01] <toothrot> (noting that the class is only added to one parent item, not the children)
[10:37:07] <Mia> toothrot, I se what you do there, but I need to style the elements with a certain id
[10:37:17] <toothrot> oh... i'm sorry.
[10:37:21] <Mia> :)
[10:37:22] <toothrot> i thought they all needed the same style
[10:37:27] <Mia> no, no
[10:37:44] <Mia> that's why I'm havving difficulties.. because I can not pre-create css rules for random id's
[10:37:57] <Mia> and it's not widely supported to do that on-the-fly I guess
[10:38:02] <Mia> (or even it is, it's tricky)
[10:38:17] <Mia> But if there is a way to do it like this without all the mess, I would love to know, still
[10:38:37] <toothrot> what's the criteria for styling them?
[10:39:03] <Mia> toothrot, well mainly visibility, and color
[10:39:09] <Mia> but I mean, why do you ask that
[10:39:17] <toothrot> i mean, how do you decide which ones to style
[10:39:22] <Mia> if there is a style-dependent way of doint that I can change my route to fit, maybe.
[10:39:33] <Mia> Oh, so the items are streamed through the server
[10:39:50] <Mia> when there is a new item with a specific id, I recolor all of the ones with the same id for 3 seconds
[10:39:53] <Mia> to show that there is an "update"
[10:40:11] <Mia> and then I swap it back
[10:40:39] <Mia> does it make sense toothrot
[10:40:42] <toothrot> yes
[10:41:41] <toothrot> but i think you're right, there's no easy way to handle it. the best you can do is hope for a performant way to select all the elements i think..
[10:41:50] <toothrot> if they're truly unordered anyways
[10:42:04] <toothrot> (eg not grouped by id)
[10:43:29] <Mia> toothrot, well if I group them by id I'll still need to select them and move/append them to some other "parent"
[10:43:49] <Mia> since items are not there on the page creation (they're streamed) I couldn't find a true way to organize stuff currently.
[10:43:58] <Mia> If there is a less processor intensive way we can do
[10:44:58] <Oka> Mia: What are you doing?
[10:45:20] <Mia> Oka, experimenting/learning/challengingmyself
[10:45:25] <Mia> not on a project to be honest
[10:45:33] <Mia> I'm just creating cases to get myself into trouble
[10:45:37] <Mia> :)
[11:07:25] <geri> how can i enable the vertical scrollbar per default for a jqxListBox?
[11:10:35] <RedShift> hi all
[11:10:50] <RedShift> how do I attach events to HTML elements that are added after being loaded via AJAX?
[11:11:18] <RedShift> so I have a list of radio buttons that's being loaded via AJAX, but the "change" or "click", etc... events don't fire when I click on them
[11:11:38] <RedShift> if I write them manually in my HTML code, they work, if they are being added during page loading via AJAX, they don't
[11:14:29] <Oka> RedShift: You have to delegate the event handler
[11:15:01] <RedShift> Oka just found this post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/203198/event-binding-on-dynamically-created-elements
[11:15:06] <RedShift> that's what I was needing
[11:15:27] <Oka> Bingo.
[11:30:12] <geri> how can i enable the vertical scrollbar per default for a jqxListBox?
[11:39:27] <sweet2k4> what is correct to use when changeing src of an image $('#element').prop('src', 'path'); or $('#element').attr('src', 'path'); ?
[11:40:14] <Duvdevan> attr is bettter
[11:40:16] <Duvdevan> I think
[11:40:24] <Duvdevan> you may as well use this
[11:40:38] <Duvdevan> $('img#element').on('load', function() { this.src = 'path'; });
[11:42:20] <sweet2k4> okey. could i do $('img#element').src ='path';?
[11:43:25] <sweet2k4> i want to change the src when a btn is clicked
[11:44:02] <sweet2k4> Duvdevan: ^
[11:44:26] <Duvdevan> okay, so trigger an event
[11:44:47] <Duvdevan> $('button#yourButtonId').click(function() { /* do what ever you please */ });
[11:45:36] <sweet2k4> Duvdevan: yeah, and thats why i wounder if $('img#element').src ='path';? would work. Like $('button#yourButtonId').click(function() { $('img#element').src ='path'; });
[11:45:59] <Duvdevan> $('img#element')[0].src  will  work
[11:46:11] <Duvdevan> with [0] index you will get the DOM instance of your element
[11:46:19] <Duvdevan> otherwise, use the jquery's prop/attr methods
[11:46:24] <Duvdevan> or you can do the same with
[11:46:35] <Duvdevan> $('img#element').get(0).src
[11:46:41] <Duvdevan> also gets the instance of a DOM
[11:46:50] <sweet2k4> okey makes sens
[11:47:34] <sweet2k4> and if i only have one img with the id="element" i could skip the (0) ?
[11:48:12] <sweet2k4> i mean img#element refers to an array, or did u miss something?
[11:48:30] <sweet2k4> or did I miss something*
[11:51:33] <sweet2k4> il just stick to the attr, thanks for the help
[11:52:26] <geri> how can i enable the vertical scrollbar per default for a jqxListBox?
[12:20:55] <systemfault> sweet2k4: the .get(0) here is used to "unwrap" the jQuery object, not really to get its first element
[12:21:15] <systemfault> If you don't want to unwrap it, then you can use $('img#element').prop('src')
[12:21:21] <systemfault> Also, don't use .attr when you can use .prop
[12:21:36] <sweet2k4> systemfault: oh i see
[12:21:45] <sweet2k4> Why not use attr?
[12:34:43] <hmsimha_> Hi, does anyone know if there's a good jquery plugin that can resize text to fit a width *and* not change the height of the line too much? If I have two rows of the same line height I'd like them to fit their width through some combination of font-size, line-height, and letter-spacing being adjusted
[12:37:45] <systemfault> sweet2k4: Because attributes are what are parsed from the initial HTML, they're strings and not really useful in a lot of cases. (The classic example being for "checked" attribute)
[12:49:01] <sweet2k4> systemfault: alright, well i use the prop then, thanks

[14:12:15] <KrasivyMir> mmm
[14:13:17] <KrasivyMir> I've never used that library sorry, but it seems you are not reading the right element
[14:14:03] <KrasivyMir> it's hard to say without looking at the code
[14:15:19] <Webdevb> Here you go http://www.codeshare.io/oBwJ4
[14:15:26] <KrasivyMir> thx
[14:16:18] <KrasivyMir> you are not initializing the plugin

[14:16:31] <KrasivyMir> more like
[14:17:12] <KrasivyMir> you have to initialize it first, then set the update time
[14:17:41] <Webdevb> What do you mean, can you alter the codeshare to add that in...
[14:19:41] <KrasivyMir> I cant, i dont have the library, i would have to download it
[14:19:43] <KrasivyMir> read this
[14:19:44] <KrasivyMir> https://github.com/rendro/easy-pie-chart#jquery

[14:30:59] <KrasivyMir> wait
[14:31:05] <KrasivyMir> ill give you a working example

[14:50:00] <beasty> and what's that error ?
[14:50:03] <KrasivyMir> can you post the new code on the share code page thingy?
[15:06:10] <Webdevb> KrasivyMir: http://www.codeshare.io/oBwJ4
[15:06:32] <Webdevb> Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[15:09:38] <Webdevb> KrasivyMir: http://www.codeshare.io/oBwJ4
[15:09:49] <Webdevb> KrasivyMir: You can just overwrite it if needs be.
[15:10:41] <Webdevb> haha works if you do it the other way round like your said.

[15:30:53] <docdoak> Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong on this very simple webpage? the $.get is not running (the final console output is still just 1) http://hastebin.com/eyuxubudek.xml
[15:33:33] <KrasivyMir> I would say the browser cannot access data in the disk.. or am i crazy?
[15:34:36] <KrasivyMir> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/371875/local-file-access-with-javascript
[15:39:01] <shoky> docdoak: put the console.log inside the $.get callback function

[15:51:47] <docdoak> it never logs
[16:35:13] <hellier> I want to split a number that has an optional decimal, I'm doing: string.split(/\d+/) but it fucks up if there is a decimal within the number.
[16:35:20] <hellier> Any clue how to fix that up?
[16:38:20] <Guest30532> Greetings
[16:44:04] <BillCriswell> hellier: So you want something one: "foo 234 bar 12.340 baz" -> ["foo", "bar", "baz"] ?
[16:45:07] <cjohnson> hellier: [\d.]+ works for me
[16:45:22] <cjohnson> I think \d should match decimal points though no?
[16:46:08] <cjohnson> hrm, nope. \d is [0-9]
[16:46:30] <jikuja> or maybe even [\d.,]+
[16:47:12] <jikuja> at least if you are coding something which might be used by others
[16:47:52] <hellier> BillCriswell, the floating number is optional, the decimal may not exist sometimes.
[16:48:02] <cjohnson> depends entirely on what your expected input is
[16:48:42] <cjohnson> if you're dealing with primarily US inputs, a comma might throw off the regex. depends
[16:49:08] <BillCriswell> hellier: Right, but what's the split for?
[16:49:12] <hellier> http://jsbin.com/godacireju/1/
[16:49:36] <cjohnson> what is your expected output?
[16:49:41] <jikuja> also digit grouping.
[16:49:42] <cjohnson> you'd be losing the numbers iwth split and that regex
[16:49:43] <hellier> http://jsbin.com/godacireju/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[16:49:45] <reynierpm> hi there, I am trying to get this (http://jsbin.com/qixesirepo/1/edit?js,console,output) jsbin working but it does not work, I am trying to setup as closest as I have on my dev environment to show you what is my issue
[16:49:49] <hellier> epected output 'g'
[16:49:54] <hellier> expected*
[16:49:57] <cjohnson> jikuja: well, that's a string then, and another question entirely
[16:50:26] <reynierpm> the idea is when I click on ¨Add country¨ in the table replace the text itself by each ¨entities.pais¨ in data var
[16:50:31] <reynierpm> can any take a look to my code?
[16:50:46] <cjohnson> hellier: can you give more sample input data? are you trying to get the unit for a given line?
[16:50:54] <cjohnson> and do you also want the value?
[16:51:06] <cjohnson> like from a nutrition facts label?
[16:51:20] <cjohnson> I would be doing a regex with subreferences to read that data
[16:51:27] <BillCriswell> parseInt('1.23'.split(' ')[1])
[16:51:31] <hellier> Okkay, a string is for example: Serving Size: 1.40g -  want to caputre the unit (grams), so that would be g
[16:51:37] <BillCriswell> That was not my console.
[16:51:42] <cjohnson> you only want the unit? You don't want 1.40 as well?
[16:51:43] <hellier> basically in a nutshell, i want to capture the text are the number
[16:51:56] <hellier> i don't want 1.40 as well, i've already worked out how to grab that :P
[16:52:04] <cjohnson> yeah but why not do both in one clean regex
[16:52:13] <cjohnson> this one won't be flexible to labels with numbers in their name
[16:52:24] <reynierpm> any?
[16:52:55] <cjohnson> 'Serving Size: 1.40g'.match(/([0-9\.]+)(\w+)$/) this would give you both hellier
[16:53:05] <cjohnson> 'Serving Size: 1.40g'.match(/([0-9\.]+)\s?(\w+)$/)
[16:53:27] <BillCriswell> parseFloat('Servive Size: 1.34a'.split(' ').slice(-1)[0]) returns 1.34
[16:53:32] <hellier> ah thanks
[16:53:43] <BillCriswell> No regex needed.
[16:53:53] <cjohnson> he needs the unit as well
[16:54:01] <cjohnson> regex is the right tool to get both, imo
[16:54:24] <BillCriswell> then just no parseFloat
[16:54:35] <cjohnson> meh, less flexible
[16:55:01] <cjohnson> nothing wrong with regex
[16:55:22] <BillCriswell> I don't understand how the regex is more flexible.
[16:55:37] <cjohnson> Serving Size: 1.40 g   for instance, would break yours
[16:55:51] <cjohnson> and if the input starts changing even more, the regex is easier to adapt to new input
[16:56:28] <cjohnson> I hate rewriting code if I can just improve the regex
[16:57:58] <cjohnson> also as somebody who understands regex, it's easier to deduce what's going on in the regex. You can see how it would apply to a string directly, where as yours requires me to break things down into pieces. it's just personal preference
[16:59:22] <BillCriswell> Yeah, different strokes. I just think it's easier without it.
[17:04:38] <Prometheian> What's the best way to show a partial bit of text and then show it all when it's clicked? I can capture the click and use slide down to show the entire thing, but I'm unsure about the partial showing.
[17:05:46] <cjohnson> on init, replace the text with the partial
[17:05:54] <cjohnson> or put the full text in an attribute
[17:05:56] <cjohnson> or in another node
[17:06:09] <cjohnson> and hide the partial and show the other node, or swap in the full text from the attribute
[17:06:30] <cjohnson> as for getting the partial itself... is there HTML in the text?
[17:06:41] <Prometheian> The text is loaded from a ko object :P
[17:06:45] <Prometheian> That's no worry! :D
[17:06:46] <cjohnson> dunno what that means
[17:06:55] <Prometheian> oh, text is dynamically loaded
[17:06:58] <Prometheian> form a db
[17:07:02] <Prometheian> through a viewmodel
[17:07:04] <cjohnson> ok that part doesn't matter
[17:07:06] <cjohnson> does it have HTML in it
[17:07:07] <Prometheian> ^^
[17:07:09] <Prometheian> nope
[17:07:11] <Prometheian> just raw text
[17:08:11] <cjohnson> cool, what I would do is split the text into words .split(' ') then iterate over the words, counting their lengths, until you reach your partial text limit. then drop the last word if it will be partial. and everything after
[17:08:24] <cjohnson> or you could just do .substr and chop off the last word regardless
[17:08:29] <cjohnson> unless you don't mind half-words
[17:08:44] <Prometheian> Was planning on limiting to X characters and adding '...'
[17:09:43] <cjohnson> right yep you would do that. I was just explaininghow to limit to X
[17:09:51] <Prometheian> ty :)
[17:13:40] <BillCriswell> How are you liking knockout?
[17:13:55] <Prometheian> It's a lotta fun :D
[17:14:10] <Prometheian> Haven't used anything else like Ember or Angular so can't speak for it, but ko is fun!
[17:14:24] <BillCriswell> That's cool.
[17:14:44] <Prometheian> You use it?
[17:15:15] <BillCriswell> No, I'm using a different MVVM type deal though. It's quite a different approach.
[17:15:30] <Prometheian> What are ya using?
[17:15:41] <BillCriswell> http://vuejs.org/
[17:16:21] <Prometheian> Oh, cool. I believe that's similar to angular but angular is very heavy.
[17:17:02] <BillCriswell> Yeah it shares some common terminology but it feels a lot cleaner than Angular..
[17:17:46] <Prometheian> I'll go with your word on that given my lack of experience with angular, but cool!
[17:17:51] <pll> hey guys, can someone point me in the direction of how I could parse info found here: http://theplayoffpool.com/new/data.json  -- all the examples I have don't seem to be wrapped in <tags> and I can't seem to reference the data at all
[17:18:11] <pll> would like to just loop through and print all tahe visiting-team.display_names for e.g.
[17:19:01] <BillCriswell> pll: $(obj.games[0]).find('visiting-team').each() ? I think?
[17:19:58] <pll> so then obj.games[0] [1] [2] [3] would have them
[17:20:12] <pll> my jquery is very poor
[17:20:30] <Prometheian> I can't do a $.get on it, you might need to do some jsonp bullshit if that's the route you're looking to go.
[17:20:54] <pll> what you mean by that? I can supply a jsonp parameter it says
[17:21:04] <Prometheian> hold on, lemme grab my code
[17:21:06] <pll> to get the data; just unsure what parameter I would supply?
[17:21:46] <pll> jsonp:	If output is not specified, and the jsonp parameter is, then the data is returned as jsonp (i.e., wrapped in the method name you specify).
[17:22:49] <Prometheian> Are you sure this is valid json?
[17:23:10] <pll> says its supposed to be, may I pm for a moment?
[17:23:28] <BillCriswell> pll: http://jsfiddle.net/ap5q67v5/ like this?
[17:23:47] <cjohnson> just post it in the chan pll
[17:23:51] <BillCriswell> Oh there's more than one.
[17:24:06] <Prometheian> http://jsfiddle.net/9dua5u3j/
[17:24:32] <Prometheian> Hitting their page like that gives me an error in my console.
[17:24:53] <Prometheian> ah, forgot to link it w/ jquery
[17:25:17] <pll>  http://theplayoffpool.com/new/data.json <-- so is that a better json format now?
[17:25:38] <BillCriswell> pll: http://jsfiddle.net/ap5q67v5/1/ there you go.
[17:25:41] <Prometheian> ReferenceError: shsMSNBCTicker is not defined
[17:26:06] <pll> well, i just added that as an object
[17:26:18] <Prometheian> It doesn't like the json output.
[17:26:21] <Prometheian> What backend is this?
[17:26:27] <pll> i know, its an output
[17:26:46] <BillCriswell> It's json, just games is an array of xml strings.
[17:26:55] <BillCriswell> Seems... stupid.
[17:26:55] <cjohnson> pll: jsonp is meant to accept the name of the function to call as a param
[17:26:59] <cjohnson> and that's what you wrap around the json
[17:27:05] <cjohnson> generally
[17:27:10] <pll> so, can be omitted
[17:27:21] <cjohnson> http://theplayoffpool.com/new/data.json?callback=foo
[17:27:28] <cjohnson> foo({"sport": "NHL"...
[17:28:02] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/ap5q67v5/2/ is just grabbing the team names
[17:28:56] <pll> how would I refer to the data to output it?
[17:29:13] <cjohnson> depends on your code making the ajax call
[17:30:31] <pll> end goal is to make a scoreboard from this, basicaly output a <div> ... </div> for each game and drop it into a content box or something
[17:30:56] <cjohnson> he just gave you an example though
[17:30:57] <pll> was trying to use some basic examples in tutorial but the <> xml wrapper or whatever it is is tossing me for a loop
[17:31:10] <cjohnson> he showed you how to read the xml :P
[17:31:19] <pll> does the example print anything or just storing it in a variable? When I run I see nothing
[17:31:22] <cjohnson> you can just use standard jquery selectors on it
[17:32:06] <cjohnson> well what does it say? console.log. so open your console ;)
[17:32:16] <cjohnson> reading the code helps  to understand what's going on
[17:35:19] <pll> ahh, wasn't even familiar with console.log, but read up on it and found it now
[17:35:23] <pll> thanks
[17:47:40] <pll> if I wanted to reference multiple attributes;     console.log(xml.find('visiting-team').attr("['display_name']['score']"); for example?
[17:47:43] <pll> doesn't seem to be the righ tformat
[17:55:38] <BillCriswell> pll: .attr() doesn't take a selector
[17:55:53] <BillCriswell> .attr('display_name') or .attr('score') to get what you want.
[17:56:55] <pll> ty
[18:02:18] <BillCriswell> pll: http://jsfiddle.net/ap5q67v5/13/ might be helpful.
[18:03:15] <pll> ty
[18:03:17] <pll> very helpful
[18:04:55] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[18:23:10] <MetalHead77> Does anyone know if 000webhost support CORS for free domain accounts?
[18:55:26] <pll> hey guys, new with jquery here; i have simple: $.getJSON('http://localhost:3000/data.json', function(data) { alert(data); });
[18:55:37] <pll> i don't get a popup alert for osme reason; the link exists
[18:59:30] <Snerf> add a .fail and see if it errors (and get the error msg).. could be invalid json
[19:03:56] <pll> looks like it fails parseerror
[19:04:38] <pll> thanks
[19:04:42] <pll> that helps
[19:06:11] <Snerf> bad json then most likely, use an online json tester :)
[19:06:48] <pll> got it, if i load: $.getJSON("data.json", function(data) { alert(data); } it alerts me now
[19:06:51] <shebbi> jsonp any good?
[19:07:06] <pll> how would I refer to the data in a foreach? data.forEach(function(x) {
[19:07:18] <pll> seems to yeild a data not defined error
[19:09:23] <systemfault> shebbi: It's really bad but it's a workaround for the SOP
[19:10:05] <shebbi> systemfault: better than SOP at least
[19:10:39] <systemfault> Well, if you don't need to support shit browsers, you can use CORS and avoid JSONP
[19:13:48] <shebbi> lol
[19:16:10] <cjohnson> pll: console.log your data
[19:19:23] <tsmith> Anyone know how Froala works?
[19:27:30] <unseensoul> How can I get a return value of true from a successful ajax call?
[19:29:44] <cjohnson> what do you mean by that
[19:31:29] <unseensoul> Let's say I'm interested in something like... if (jqxhr.done(...) == true) return true;
[19:33:41] <jikuja> you really can't do that kind of code. You need to use callbacks or synchronous ajax.
[19:35:27] <unseensoul> jikuja, you are right, I've just figured that out.
[19:36:38] <unseensoul> Thanks :)
[19:43:36] <Prometheian> There a good library that will make specified elements track w/ the user as they scroll?
[19:44:37] <cjohnson> position: fixed
[19:44:42] <cjohnson> CSS
[19:46:05] <Prometheian> Here I am trying to build a nuke when a simple rock will do.
[19:46:06] <Prometheian> ty.
[19:46:22] <cjohnson> ;)
[19:53:18] <hendry> hi, there, how do I select the anchor value "foo" or "bar" here after a click? http://jsbin.com/cecowilaxa/1/
[20:08:29] <shoky> hendry: $(this).find('a').text()
[20:11:07] <hendry> shoky: thank you!
[20:15:30] * CssNoob good afternoon y'all
[20:26:31] <SirFunk> with a $.post how do you get it to send the data as a json 'request payload' instead of form data?
[20:50:16] <Prometheian> I'm trying to get an event to fire when I get to the bottom of a page. The result of said event makes the page longer (ala infinite scrolling). I tried jQuery Waypoints but it just acts kinda klunky and I was wondering if there were better alternatives.
[21:08:20] <Prometheian> Wrote my own ,nvm
[21:37:22] <hendry> i'm trying to get the value of an input type=email from a list item. This isn't working: var to = $(this).parent().("input[type='email']").val() // Can you spot my error?
[21:39:39] <Uhkis> hendry: do you have multiple email inputs?
[21:40:43] <hendry> Uhkis: just one in the list item
[21:41:26] <hendry> $(this) gets returned since i bind the click on a button in that list item
[21:41:52] <Uhkis> why not just use $("input[type='email']") ?
[21:45:11] <hendry> Uhkis: oh, yeah, that works: var to = $(this).parent().find("input[type='email']").val()

[23:05:52] <jikuja> maybe you should change your  nick and try again. oh wait! you have done it already.
[23:07:04] <Uhkis> jikuja: but he's done it only 3 times (from what i've seen)
[23:08:00] <jikuja> yup. I check that after I noticed that fiddle was here earlier.
[23:15:27] <elite>  hey there guys, im a newbie and I'd appericiate your help, could somebody show me what's wrong with this code that JS don't work?? http://jsfiddle.net/gp110au4/1/
[23:17:01] <saint>  elite this is problen with your code or fiddle
[23:17:43] <Uhkis> elite: you don't have jquery on in the fiddle, check it from the left menu
[23:18:02] <saint> you dont select the j query library
[23:18:08] <elite> right:)
[23:18:31] <elite> thanks for pointing it out, i just linked jquery file locally but it still didnt work, hmmm...
[23:18:43] <Cork> elite: http://jsfiddle.net/gp110au4/2/
[23:18:46] <Cork> works just fine
[23:19:21] <elite> now worked:) because I had jquery file in <body>, moved it into <head> and it worked;)
[23:19:40] <Cork> elite: though you most likely want to use .hide() and .show() instead of .css display
[23:19:47] <saint> can any body know how to know which list element is dragged
[23:19:50] <saint> http://jsfiddle.net/cwygfumo/
[23:20:11] <elite> Cork its a better practice to use show and hide over css display none?
[23:20:44] <Cork> elite: yes, cause then the site can be used by users without js
[23:20:47] <Cork> elite: http://jsfiddle.net/gp110au4/3/
[23:21:32] <elite> Cork yeah indeed, good point, thanks for pointing that out... haven't considered people without js
[23:22:06] <Uhkis> well that is really rare nowadays
[23:22:20] <Cork> it isn't
[23:22:30] <Cork> browsers that doesn't support it at all sure
[23:22:44] <Cork> but plenty of users selectively enable js for sites/domains
[23:23:17] <Cork> and yes they depressingly often have to write fix css rules for broken sites
[23:24:12] <phiz> Cork: like this? http://i.imgur.com/7H7qu2D.gif
[23:25:02] <Cork> phiz: heh old
[23:25:13] <Cork> well no, more like the only getting there to fix it afterwards
[23:25:40] <sunny_> how can i know which id is draggable in jquery\
[23:25:44] <sunny_> http://jsfiddle.net/cwygfumo/
[23:26:10] <elite> that cartoon was funny! hahahaha
[23:26:43] <Cork> sunny_: .hasClass('ui-draggable') ?
[23:26:55] <Cork> sunny_: also you're html is invalid
[23:27:09] <Cork> all your elements has the id "list"
[23:27:12] <Uhkis> Cork: well if you intentionally block js from sites/domains, you should be expecting broken sites
[23:27:22] <jikuja> omg. My tip works:P
[23:27:33] <Cork> Uhkis: i should expect not fully working pages sure
[23:27:53] <Cork> but sites like forum.jquery.com that intentionally hide the content for none js users is... silly
[23:28:07] <sunny_> hi cork actually i am a free lancer and this is my project
[23:28:21] <jikuja> Why there is so many package managers and so few full documentation where to start.
[23:28:25] <sunny_> my html is valid every thing is right
[23:28:44] <sunny_> fiddle show the full functionality
[23:29:30] <Cork> sunny_: no only one element can have an id at a time
[23:29:38] <Cork> you have at least 4 with the id "list"
[23:29:41] <Cork> that is invalid
[23:30:54] <Cork> and you have duplicate class attributes on on of the spans
[23:31:05] <sunny_> ook cool use my fiddle and see the id of draggable id in  inspect elements
[23:33:03] <sunny_> see it or not
[23:34:43] <sunny_> hey cork are y there
[23:35:22] <Cork> sunny_: run the html though http://validator.w3.org/
[23:35:32] <Cork> it has a long list of errors that need to be fixed
[23:36:28] <Cork> annoying... has jsfiddle removed support for showing the unwrapped fiddle?
[23:36:55] <phiz> Cork: yeah made me think of it though
