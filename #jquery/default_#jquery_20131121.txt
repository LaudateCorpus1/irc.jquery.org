[00:00:13] <Cork> d32: is the file loaded from the same domain?
[00:00:40] <d32> yes it comes from the webapplication itself
[00:00:52] <Cork> not sure then
[00:00:59] <Cork> i usually don't use iframes
[00:01:24] <d32> the weird thing is that if you load html in the iframe and not pdf then the load is fired
[00:02:43] <Cork> d32: are you sure you actually load the pdf in the iframe?
[00:02:56] <Cork> and not an external program, like ex. acrobat
[00:03:25] <Cork> (i'm not sure if ie has a built in pdf rendering or not)
[00:04:03] <d32> it is realy loaded in the iframe maybe i need to check another pdf viewer
[00:04:24] <Cork> d32: what i meant is if it is loaded or embeded
[00:04:36] <Cork> if you are using a third party program to view the file
[00:04:49] <Cork> there is no guarantee the normal events will be fired
[00:04:50] <d32> its loaded in the iframe through acrobat reader
[00:04:55] <Cork> no
[00:05:13] <Cork> then it is loading in acrobat and acrobat is rendering it's interface in the iframe
[00:05:17] <Cork> that is embedment
[00:05:37] <Cork> and yes that tend to cause events and the like to go bye bye
[00:05:46] <d32> oke but the weird thing is chrome and firefox work perfectly
[00:06:01] <Cork> well firefox renders pdf files it self now days
[00:06:07] <Cork> and i think chrome does too
[00:06:28] <Cork> ?g pdf.js
[00:06:29] <b-ot> Cork: mozilla/pdf.js @ GitHub â†’ http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/
[00:07:56] <d32> oke thnks for the tips
[00:48:08] <Bauer1> Is there any better way to do this in jquery than create a string and then insert it? http://jsfiddle.net/b9xUf/
[00:50:13] <Cork> Bauer1: http://jsfiddle.net/b9xUf/1/
[00:50:22] <Cork> or you could go full generate dom elements
[00:50:32] <Cork> but ya, html strings is normally the lesser bad
[00:51:05] <Cork> Bauer1: though that said i tend to keep the html in the html file and that is the third way
[00:51:21] <l4ci> hey guys, i wonder whats the best way to store time/date values in a database.. which format is the easiest for calculations and showing it?
[00:51:36] <Cork> l4ci: depends on the database
[00:51:50] <l4ci> normal mysql database
[00:51:56] <Bauer1> huh, one sec that is not what I wanted Cork... I need to insert the HTMCode in a certain place in the HTML code
[00:52:22] <Cork> l4ci: datetime then
[00:52:35] <Cork> or just date or just time if you don't need the combined
[00:52:53] <Cork> Bauer1: that was that i showed you
[00:53:08] <Cork> the append at the bottom is where you should select the target
[00:53:15] <Cork> $('selector').append(dom)
[00:53:19] <Bauer1> ahhh
[00:53:21] <l4ci> okay
[00:53:22] <l4ci> thanks
[00:53:49] <Bauer1> thanks Cork!
[00:57:33] <Bauer1> Cork: so if I have a div id="div1" and I want to append my dom item INSIDE that div1, is that like $'#div1').append(dom)? o
[00:57:42] <Cork> yes
[01:02:10] <Serdar> if a dialog window is closed I can catch it with close: function() { } and react, but is it possible to catch if it was closed with x button?
[01:02:25] <Serdar> or can I simply disable the x button?
[01:02:51] <Cork> Serdar: the close button should trigger the close event too
[01:03:00] <Cork> the x button sorry
[01:03:15] <Serdar> yeah, that was what I found out
[01:03:30] <Serdar> I hoped close was only for x but it is for all
[01:03:52] <Cork> ah you want just the x
[01:04:05] <Serdar> or disable the x
[01:04:23] <Cork> why do you need to make a difference between those?
[01:05:49] <Serdar> The employee needs to accept or reject the ticket. each time I send a json string and close the modal window. but if he x button is pressed it must be handled like a reject
[01:06:01] <Serdar> or it should not be able to be closed with x
[01:07:15] <Cork> Serdar: so have the accept accept it
[01:07:22] <Cork> and reject trigger the close event
[01:07:31] <Cork> and do all the reject code in the close event
[01:08:04] <Serdar> but the close event will also be triggert if I close the window after pressing the accept button
[01:08:09] <Cork> Serdar: or you could hack around it, but it isn't guaranteed to keep working in future changes http://jsfiddle.net/2VTcQ/
[01:08:57] <Serdar> what the hell
[01:25:34] <kpl> I have two radiobuttons ("Inherit", "Override") with same name "prop_inherit_override". They control whether some other inputs are disabled, using the following: $("input[name='prop_inherit_override']").change(function(){ if($(this).val()=='Override'){ disable_inputs(); } else {enable_inputs(); } }); However, when I look in firebug, I cannot see that the checked property changes when I...
[01:25:36] <kpl> ...switch between checking the two radiobuttons, and I also always get the initial value when I try to use $("input[name='prop_inherit_override']").val() other places in the code than in the change trigger which works. Why? The div containing the radio buttons has style="display: block;". Could that explain it?
[01:26:31] <Cork> kpl: attributes doesn't change on the dom element as you interact with a form element
[01:26:44] <Cork> the properties is the one that holds the interactive data
[01:28:30] <kpl> So it is correct that I shouldn't see any change in firebug then. And I need to store the switch somewhere in the change-trigger?
[01:30:13] <kpl> Cork: Not sure I completely understand your comment. When you write "attributes doesn't change" and "the properties is", do you mean to distinguish between prop and attr?
[01:32:29] <lolmaus> Can someone explain this please? http://jsbin.com/OyuKoQEc/3/edit?js,output
[01:33:08] <Cork> kpl: attributes are what was on the original html
[01:33:29] <Cork> kpl: properties is what the browser converts those to, and THAT value is what is changed when the user interact with a form element
[01:33:57] <Cork> kpl: and what you see if firebug is attributes, not properties
[01:36:00] <Woet> lolmaus: because your .get is asynchronous
[01:36:07] <Woet> lolmaus: the console.log is executed before the .get is finished
[01:36:20] <lolmaus> Woet, thx
[01:36:50] <kpl> Cork: Thanks!
[01:37:43] <Serdar> short question: if a function expects a json string, will it ignore and work if I add a extra value?
[01:38:25] <Serdar> {..., ignoreThis : "test", ...}
[01:38:41] <seutje> if it's still valid json, I suppose
[01:38:51] <Cork> Serdar: does it expect json or an object?
[01:39:02] <seutje> most functions don't expect a JSON string though o.O
[01:39:10] <Cork> cause it would most likely be hard to modify the json and still keep it valid
[01:39:13] <Cork> ya
[01:39:32] <Cork> '{ "key":"value" }' <-- json
[01:39:32] <seutje> yeah, prolly just an object, then you can just add whatever as long as it doesn't override any of the keys already in there
[01:39:38] <Cork> { "key":"value" } <-- NOT json
[01:39:39] <Serdar> somone told me there don't exist json objects
[01:39:51] <Cork> ya
[01:39:59] <Cork> json is ALWAYS a string
[01:40:06] <Cork> else it is arrays or objects
[01:40:17] <seutje> it's a string representation of an object
[01:40:25] <Cork> or an array
[01:40:36] <Cork> '[]' <-- is also json
[01:40:44] <seutje> for the sake of this discussion, I'm not gonna make the distinction :P
[01:41:05] <Cork> actually
[01:41:12] <Cork> 'false' or 'true' is also valid json
[01:41:13] <Serdar> I was thinking about this: $( '#' + ticket.ID ).dialog({
[01:41:13] <Serdar>    	height: 300, closedBy: "x", ... });
[01:41:26] <Cork> Serdar: that is an object
[01:41:34] <Serdar> dialog don't know closedBy
[01:41:56] <Cork> not sure if you can store random data in the options for dialog
[01:42:12] <seutje> it might actually keep that around, not sure
[01:42:14] <Serdar> that's my question
[01:42:22] <seutje> it won't tweak out on it
[01:44:10] <Serdar> this was the easiest thing I could think of :/
[01:45:47] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/P2chu/
[01:45:56] <Cork> so ya, you can store random data in options :)
[01:47:12] <seutje> I went for cake http://jsfiddle.net/tqP94/
[01:47:44] <seutje> much better to hide cake in your dialog than random shit :P
[01:47:58] <seutje> nobody will ever think of looking there
[01:52:00] <Bauer1> Cork: I have a line like you said: var DomData = $(HTMLCode).bind('click', function() { PostFinalPlanSelection({Level:Items[i].Level}); }); but when the .bind event triggers, I have error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'Level' of undefined
[01:52:09] <Bauer1> I think its because the state of i is not saved...
[01:52:16] <Bauer1> but I am not sure how to resolve this
[01:52:17] <Cork> Bauer1: you can't do it like that
[01:52:22] <Cork> oh wait
[01:52:39] <Cork> sorry read wrong
[01:52:58] <Bauer1> no, you are right - it doesnt work this way :) question is how to do it right
[01:52:58] <Cork> so Items[i] doesn't have a member Level
[01:53:20] <Cork> Bauer1: the comment was about something completely different
[01:53:27] <Cork> and it was me reading the line wrong
[01:53:47] <Bauer1> no way, it has item during the declaration of course, but during execution - i is no longer defined I think
[01:53:57] <Bauer1> and Items probably also not defined
[01:54:06] <Cork> Bauer1: you should get a copy of Level in the function
[01:54:17] <Bauer1> what do you mean?
[01:54:17] <Cork> Bauer1: could you add the related data in a jsfiddle?
[01:54:23] <Bauer1> yes one sec
[01:54:32] <Cork> as in the PostFinalPlanSelection function
[01:54:37] <Cork> for example
[01:54:44] <Serdar> http://jsfiddle.net/Eh5AB/ maybe I am using it wrong on line 25
[01:54:55] <Bauer1> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/b9xUf/2/
[01:56:28] <Cork> Serdar: $( this ).dialog('option', 'closedBy')
[01:57:57] <Serdar> = 'accept'?
[01:58:07] <Cork> Bauer1: ah, you arn't sending Items to that function
[01:58:20] <Cork> uh... sorry
[01:58:31] <Cork> Bauer1: i asked for PostFinalPlanSelection :)
[01:58:31] <t3ch> can anyone tell me where I can find a reference to regular expressions in javascript?
[01:58:38] <Serdar> Am I the only one who believes that JS is harder than C?
[01:58:39] <t3ch> does it compare to any specific standard?
[01:58:40] <Bauer1> oh, sorry a sec
[01:58:46] <Cork> ?mdn regexp
[01:58:47] <b-ot> Cork: RegExp - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp
[01:58:58] <Cork> t3ch: yes it does
[01:59:14] <t3ch> I'm proficient with them in php
[01:59:19] <t3ch> and it appears somewhat similar
[01:59:26] <Bauer1> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/b9xUf/3/
[01:59:56] <seutje> these capitals are so confusing :(
[02:00:12] <Cork> Bauer1: and what line did you get "Cannot read property 'Level' of undefined" from?
[02:00:14] <Bauer1> seutje: I like CamelCase :)
[02:00:36] <Bauer1> on the DomData, line 5 Cork
[02:01:03] <Cork> AH
[02:01:06] <Cork> it's a for loop
[02:01:15] <Cork> Bauer1: for loops doens't create scope
[02:01:25] <Cork> so you don't get an instance of i for each loop
[02:01:32] <Cork> you just have one i that it updated
[02:01:47] <Cork> so when the events fire you run them on i where i is Items.length
[02:01:50] <Bauer1> yeah, which is why I have a problem :) but not sure how to resolve it
[02:01:54] <Cork> (that means one more then you have)
[02:02:08] <Cork> simplest is to replace for with $.each
[02:02:19] <Bauer1> I dont think I have .each in jquery 1.3
[02:02:25] <Cork> simplest is to replace for with $.each(Items, function(item) { /* rest of code */ });
[02:02:29] <Cork> it is
[02:02:36] <Cork> it's been around for ages
[02:03:16] <Cork> "version added: 1.0"
[02:03:20] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[02:03:44] <Bauer1> like this, Cork? http://jsfiddle.net/b9xUf/4/
[02:03:52] <Bauer1> err ignore line 3
[02:04:01] <Cork> yes
[02:04:03] <shoky> function(i, item)
[02:04:15] <Cork> also you need to change } to }); at the end
[02:04:27] <Cork> BAH
[02:04:40] <Cork> why oh why do $.map and $.each need to differ on that...
[02:04:48] <Cork> -_-
[02:04:48] <t3ch> can anyone tell me if regular expressions in javascript are greedy by default?
[02:05:05] <Cork> t3ch: it isn't
[02:05:14] <shoky> so silly people won't yell at them for breaking their site :(
[02:05:23] <t3ch> how can I make it greedy?
[02:06:05] <t3ch> might I add, that's a pain in the ass
[02:06:18] <Cork> t3ch: i've always seen greedy regex selectors as a speed optimization and just bad
[02:06:50] <t3ch> if I have 1021 and 1021.1 /[0-9]{3,4}(\.[0-9]{1,)?/g will match 1021 but not return 1021.1
[02:07:06] <t3ch> it simply returns 1021 twice
[02:07:09] <Cork> t3ch: just mark the next instance you want to find and then select everything up to that
[02:07:28] <Bauer1> Cork: I am not getting undefined for Item.Image (because the path is now levels/undefined
[02:07:30] <t3ch> what do you mean Cork?
[02:07:54] <t3ch> Cork: what do you mean?
[02:08:03] <Serdar> why do I need the word option there?
[02:08:32] <Cork> js> print("1021.1".match(/[0-9]{3,4}(\.[0-9]{1,})?/g)[0])
[02:08:37] <b-ot> Cork: 1021.1
[02:08:44] <Cork> js> print("aaa1021.1aaa".match(/[0-9]{3,4}(\.[0-9]{1,})?/g)[0])
[02:08:51] <b-ot> Cork: 1021.1
[02:09:18] <Cork> Serdar: cause you are grabbing a value from the dialogs option
[02:09:34] <shoky> he's not, i think
[02:09:41] <Bauer1> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/b9xUf/5/ I get undefined on Item.Image of line 4
[02:09:42] <shoky> he just wants to add data to the element
[02:09:46] <shoky> Serdar: use .data()
[02:09:48] <t3ch> Cork: would that syntax need to follow the first match?
[02:10:05] <t3ch> or would that then become the reqular expression?
[02:10:33] <Cork> t3ch: what do you mean?
[02:10:42] <t3ch> what does the [0] do exactly?
[02:10:47] <Cork> js> print("aaa1021.1aaa1111.4".match(/[0-9]{3,4}(\.[0-9]{1,})?/g)[1])
[02:10:48] <interop_madness> is there a clean and recommended way to determine registered event handlers for a jQuery object?
[02:10:52] <lolmaus> How do i sort a jQuery collection?
[02:10:52] <b-ot> Cork: 1111.4
[02:11:08] <Cork> t3ch: match returns an array with the matched strings
[02:11:30] <Cork> i use [0] in the first example cause else you just bogus data from the bot
[02:11:33] <Cork> js> print("aaa1021.1aaa1111.4".match(/[0-9]{3,4}(\.[0-9]{1,})?/g))
[02:11:38] <b-ot> Cork: 1021.1,1111.4
[02:11:41] <interop_madness> i.e. obj.on("foo", function{}).on("bar", function{}); ==> later i might want to check if there is a handler for the "bar" event
[02:11:46] <Cork> oh, it's been updated!
[02:12:06] <Cork> js> print(JSON.stringify("aaa1021.1aaa1111.4".match(/[0-9]{3,4}(\.[0-9]{1,})?/g)))
[02:12:10] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[02:12:13] <Cork> -_-
[02:12:30] <Cork> js> print(JSON.stringify("aaa1021.1aaa1111.4".match(/[0-9]{3,4}(\.[0-9]{1,})?/g)))
[02:12:35] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[02:12:38] <Cork> sigh
[02:12:41] <shoky> interop_madness: not really but $._data(DOMElement, 'events') will get you what you want. not documented and subject to change, though
[02:12:49] <t3ch> var matches = textlan.match(/[0-9]{3,4}(\.[0-9]{1,)?/g)[0];
[02:13:07] <t3ch> like that?  textlan is the result of a .text() call
[02:13:11] <Cork> interop_madness: best option is normally to use namespaces
[02:13:26] <Cork> t3ch: yes
[02:13:28] <Bauer1> Cork: debug mode shows that for $.each(Items, function (Item) {, apparently Item is integer 0, while this contains the properties of the actual Item... why is that?

[02:13:55] <Cork> Bauer1: see shoky's comment
[02:13:58] <shoky> Bauer1: change it to function(i, Item)

[02:15:17] <Bauer1> thanks Cork and shoky! :)
[02:16:00] <oxsav> Hello. I'm trying to do a xmlhttprequest to a server
[02:16:26] <oxsav> and I can't do it.. first of all "Origin is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin."
[02:17:05] <Cork> oxsav: you can't do ajax calls to a third party server unless they configure there server to allow it
[02:17:10] <t3ch> Cork:  If i set var matches = string.match(/pattern/)[0];
[02:17:30] <t3ch> wouldn't i have to call the regular expression on matches[0]?
[02:17:53] <oxsav> Cork: It allows. It is made for that
[02:18:01] <t3ch> because the example and what the bot returned don't seem to work in my script.
[02:18:11] <Serdar> data you say, let me check
[02:18:16] <oxsav> I know that I had this question 2 days ago.. but stills remains..
[02:18:19] <shoky> oxsav: that error message means it is not configured properly for CORS
[02:18:43] <Cork> oxsav: the error you get explicitly says it doesn't
[02:19:09] <Cork> oxsav: check so the server doesn't use jsonp
[02:19:18] <Cork> if it does you request that data in a different way
[02:19:36] <oxsav> Resource interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type text/plain: url?callback=jQuery191017838170193135738_1385029151440&_=1385029151441". jquery-1.9.1.js:8336 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
[02:19:37] <joroci> can i know which element the mouse is over not in a mouse event?
[02:19:43] <Cork> t3ch: that query will be match not matches
[02:19:46] <joroci> like keydown for example
[02:19:46] <oxsav> and what about this error? I receive the response
[02:20:03] <oxsav> and it's a json valid response..
[02:20:15] <Cork> t3ch: var matches = string.match(/pattern/); matches[0] match 1, matches[1] match 2 and so on
[02:20:23] <shoky> oxsav: that means you're trying to do a jsonp request but the server is not configured for JSONP
[02:20:38] <lintguy> Hello, maybe someone can help me. I'm trying to make a page makro, by injecting a jquery/js script. But i get undefined on an array item and i just cannot understand why (at console.log(item) ): http://pastebin.com/0NQy25Mk
[02:20:39] <shoky> at least, that url isn't
[02:20:39] <t3ch> here is an example http://jsfiddle.net/yGbn2/56/
[02:20:40] <Cork> oxsav: the response is blocked from you cause the server doesn't tell the browser to allow it
[02:21:28] <mortenmadsen> Hi, can anybody help me get this working : $(".myClass:not(#myObj1, #myObj2)").hide(); ??
[02:21:55] <motaka2> does anyone knows of a good book about node.js?
[02:22:03] <shoky> mortenmadsen that should work, i think
[02:22:42] <Cork> t3ch: also you might want to mute the group you have there, so it isn't included in the matches array as a separate group
[02:22:51] <mortenmadsen> shoky: hmmm, doesn't seem like it, my by problem is another place. will check it out
[02:24:03] <t3ch> what do you mean?
[02:24:10] <t3ch> i'm not the best with javascript.
[02:24:44] <oxsav> Cork:  tks
[02:24:51] <t3ch> the jsfiddle seems to have broke?
[02:25:06] <Cork> ya, something throws exceptions
[02:25:07] <oxsav> shoky: The jsonp makes sense because I configured the server with jsonp
[02:25:17] <t3ch> but it works in my browser...
[02:25:54] <shoky> oxsav: well, the server is not responding with a JSONP response
[02:25:56] <mortenmadsen> shoky: Ahhh it does work :-) problem is somewhere else :-)
[02:27:21] <Cork> t3ch: ah, sorry match doesn't collect groups
[02:27:23] <Cork> forgot that
[02:27:38] <t3ch> This works http://jsfiddle.net/yGbn2/58/
[02:28:38] <lintguy> Anyone? I'm really asking for anything, a hint, anything.. i just don't get why it doesn't work.
[02:28:58] <t3ch> I was missing a } in the one selector...
[02:33:39] <t3ch> Cork: that is nearly useless
[02:34:08] <Cork> t3ch: sorry?
[02:34:22] <t3ch> match
[02:34:36] <Cork> well if you need groups use .exec
[02:34:39] <Cork> ?mdn exec
[02:34:40] <b-ot> Cork: RegExp.prototype.exec() - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/exec
[02:34:50] <Cork> it works the other way around thorugh
[02:34:54] <Cork> *through
[02:35:00] <Cork> you give the string to the regex
[02:35:27] <Cork> match is often enough, and is simple to use
[02:35:39] <Cork> but exec is quite a bit harder, but can do it all
[02:35:49] <t3ch> I'm trying to modify legal citations
[02:35:58] <t3ch> on the client end so the page load doesn't take forever.
[02:36:30] <oxsav> Cork: shoky yesterday I did a simple example in java and it worked
[02:36:51] <oxsav> and I have in chrome an extension "chrome poster"
[02:36:54] <Cork> oxsav: ya, but java doesn't have much security
[02:37:04] <Cork> and extensions are prived code
[02:37:08] <oxsav> and it works as well
[02:37:19] <Cork> ya, cause none of them respect same origin
[02:37:24] <lintguy> Hm, using a more recent jquery and my script actually works.
[02:37:31] <lintguy> Odd.
[02:37:34] <oxsav> hmmm
[02:37:40] <Cork> ?mdn cors
[02:37:40] <b-ot> Cork: CORs - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[02:37:54] <Cork> the server needs to be configured for that
[02:37:57] <lintguy> I don't see me using any newer jquery stuff?
[02:38:09] <Cork> and even then you will lose support for most ie browsers
[02:38:31] <Cork> (not sure if ie11 finally support cors)
[02:38:39] <shoky> lintguy: what version doesn't it work with
[02:38:44] <Cork> but i know ie10 doesn't
[02:38:45] <oxsav> Cork: I can't use IE :p
[02:38:53] <Cork> oxsav: good for you
[02:38:54] <oxsav> that 's not a problem
[02:39:13] <shoky> lintguy: i see you're using .attr for value.  that's wrong with newer jquery.  use .val()
[02:40:57] <lintguy> shoky: You mean prop?
[02:41:10] <shoky> lintguy: i mean .val()  but .prop would be fine too
[02:41:13] <t3ch> how can i check if a . exists at the end of the string and remove it?
[02:41:31] <lintguy> shoky: they didn't remove .attr though, they just defaulted it to use .prop instead
[02:41:47] <lintguy> shoky: the problem was the other way around though.
[02:41:50] <shoky> lintguy:  the "value" that you want to change is the property, not the attribute
[02:42:02] <shoky> lintguy: in older jquery, they had it wrong, and .attr would also write to the property
[02:42:04] <Cork> t3ch: .replace(/\.$/, '')
[02:42:21] <lintguy> shoky: but .val is to write a value, not read?
[02:42:26] <shoky> lintguy: it's both
[02:42:43] <lintguy> shoky: Hm, i have to try, thanks for pointing it out
[02:43:03] <shoky> lintguy: just don't look in the DOM view to see the "value" attribute being changed, because it shouldn't be changing
[02:43:29] <shoky> by DOM view i mean the browser's devtools html/elements view
[02:45:47] <felixjet> what should i do to check and checkbox state? elem.checked, $(elem).prop("checked") or $(elem).is(":checked") ?
[02:46:06] <Cork> felixjet: any of them is ok
[02:46:07] <shoky> felixjet: they're all fine
[02:46:20] <felixjet> but any preference / good practice ?
[02:46:25] <Cork> the last one is a little less preferment, but that's about it
[02:46:43] <shoky> felixjet if you have a raw DOM element like "elem" then i'd go with elem.checked
[02:46:52] <Cork> ya, same here
[02:47:01] <shoky> if you just have a jquery object  $elem  from somewhere, i'd go with one of the others..
[02:47:09] <shoky> donno which, i think i change it
[02:47:22] <Cork> .prop("checked") grabs the value from properties
[02:47:31] <shoky> yeap
[02:47:33] <Cork> while is actually uses sizzle
[02:47:40] <felixjet> and what does that mean?
[02:47:40] <shoky> but .is  is totally readable :(
[02:47:47] <felixjet> its better to use prop ?
[02:47:51] <Cork> and from sizzle runs callbacks
[02:47:58] <Cork> felixjet: yes
[02:48:06] <Cork> not that it normally matters
[02:48:21] <Cork> cause most code isn't that reliant on performance
[02:48:34] <felixjet> i see
[02:48:37] <felixjet> thx
[02:49:04] <felixjet> http://jsperf.com/prop-vs-ischecked/5
[02:49:15] <felixjet> .is is x2 faster than prop !
[02:49:26] <Cork> uh
[02:49:38] <felixjet> i mean
[02:49:41] <felixjet> the opposite
[02:49:44] <Cork> ah
[02:49:48] <felixjet> prop is 2x faster
[02:49:57] <Cork> btw attr('checked') <-- don't use this
[02:50:01] <felixjet> but .checked is like 50 times faster than prop
[02:50:01] <felixjet> xD
[02:50:03] <Cork> it won't give you the effect you expect :)
[02:50:06] <felixjet> yea i know
[02:50:07] <Cork> ya
[02:50:08] <felixjet> it wont update
[02:50:12] <felixjet> is just the default value on attr
[02:50:15] <Cork> cause it just checks a variable
[02:50:20] <Cork> can't be much faster then that
[02:50:39] <Cork> heh
[02:50:55] <Cork> [0].checked is ~ 217 times faster then .prop :)
[02:51:11] <felixjet> since i actually have this var checkbox = $(this).next('input:checkbox');
[02:51:16] <felixjet> im gonna use checkbox.checked
[02:51:17] <Cork> and prop is 5 times faster then is
[02:51:29] <Cork> no
[02:51:29] <shoky> nah, checkbox is a jquery object
[02:51:42] <Cork> checkbox[0].checked or checkbox.prop('checked')
[02:52:08] <felixjet> it wont work?
[02:52:14] <felixjet> <.<
[02:52:18] <felixjet> [0] is ugly
[02:52:19] <felixjet> xD
[02:52:31] <felixjet> im gonna use prop then
[02:52:32] <felixjet> hah
[02:52:33] <hirsty> hey all currently i am using $("input[type=text]").each(function(){ to validate my inputs, how can i filet out the ones that have display:none applied to them?
[02:52:34] <shoky> just forget the jsperf
[02:52:35] <shoky> yeah :)
[02:52:50] <felixjet> but good to know the alternatives/differences!
[02:53:00] <hirsty> *filter
[02:53:35] <shoky> hirsty:  $("input[type=text]").not(':visible')  might work
[02:53:48] <shoky> oops you want to filter them out
[02:53:56] <shoky> so  .filter instead of .not
[02:54:27] <Aamir> $("input[type=text]:visible") ?
[02:54:30] <shoky> or just $("input[type=text]:visible")
[02:54:31] <shoky> ya
[02:54:59] <hirsty> would this work when i apply display:none to the container?
[02:55:17] <hirsty> oh wait just realized...
[02:55:27] <hirsty> applied it to the wrong jquery..
[02:55:33] <hirsty> >_<
[02:55:45] <felixjet> since :checkbox is an alias of [type=text]
[02:55:51] <felixjet> i mean type=checkbox
[02:55:56] <felixjet> there is an alias for type=text ?
[02:56:02] <shoky> there's :text
[02:56:10] <felixjet> so you can do input:text:visible ?
[02:56:12] <shoky> it catches <input> too
[02:56:20] <felixjet> :text:visible
[02:56:25] <shoky> think so
[02:56:35] <felixjet> its shorter
[02:56:36] <felixjet> xD
[02:57:18] <shoky> tho i think $("input[type=text]") is much faster than $(":text")
[03:00:17] <t3ch> js> print("1101.".replace(/\.$/,''))
[03:00:23] <b-ot> t3ch: 1101
[03:00:32] <t3ch> this is frustrating...
[03:00:43] <t3ch> js> print("1101. ".replace(/\.\s$/,''))
[03:00:48] <b-ot> t3ch: 1101
[03:01:02] <t3ch> for some reason, in my script, that doesn't work.
[03:01:24] <t3ch> the console.log is returning 1101. with some whitespace.
[03:02:46] <shoky> how much whitespace
[03:03:00] <t3ch> one spot.
[03:03:10] <Larsibarsi> Hi, plan to have a menu on top of the page. Then, when the user scrolles the page down and the menu left the viewport, the footer menu appeares. So I want to change the CSS visibility of my <div id="footer"> in condition to the position the user has scrolled to. Ho can I do this with jQuery?
[03:03:31] <shoky> donno.. fiddle it
[03:04:42] <t3ch> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/yGbn2/59/
[03:05:03] <t3ch> why will it not remove the . at the end of the string with four characters?
[03:06:34] <t3ch> it's like the expression engine is broke.
[03:07:21] <shoky> t3ch: calling .replace doesn't mutate the string
[03:07:38] <shoky> strings are immutable.  tval2 = tval2.replace(...)
[03:08:20] <t3ch> that doesn't work either.
[03:08:26] <t3ch> http://jsfiddle.net/yGbn2/60/
[03:08:40] <shoky> works, no?
[03:08:46] <t3ch> check it out?
[03:08:52] <shoky> i am..
[03:09:11] <shoky> output:  2306
[03:09:45] <t3ch> my browser is showing <a name="2306.">
[03:10:04] <t3ch> it's chrome 31.0.1650.57
[03:10:21] <shoky> hm?
[03:10:28] <shoky> weren't we talking about the console logs
[03:10:42] <t3ch> in the source element of the page.
[03:10:46] <shoky> you're putting tval in the "name" attribute
[03:10:55] <t3ch> i need some sleep....
[03:10:57] <t3ch> thanks man.
[03:11:03] <shoky> ;p
[03:12:06] <t3ch> well thanks for helping me out guys...
[03:12:08] <t3ch> i appreciate it.
[03:20:59] <JBreit> anyone around familiar with the .clone() method?
[03:21:10] <shoky> `anyone
[03:21:10] <b-ot> shoky: Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?
[03:21:14] <shoky> `someone
[03:21:19] <shoky> JBreit: just ask.
[03:21:45] <Cork> ?ask
[03:21:45] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[03:22:04] <JBreit> I was told that the clone method would help with the jumpiness in my scroll animated header http://innermindco.com/editional/wtf/index.html
[03:22:29] <shoky> its not just jumpiness
[03:22:39] <shoky> cant scroll if i drag the scrollbar
[03:22:51] <JBreit> ya that is an issue D:
[03:22:59] <JBreit> works good with the scroll wheel
[03:23:32] <JBreit> until you scroll back up and it has that jump as it reassembles the header
[03:23:59] <JBreit> started to read up on the .clone() method since I was told to look into it but not sure how i would implement it to fix my issue
[03:24:15] <JBreit> kind of a newb and this was the 1st thing I ever did on my own
[03:24:18] <JBreit> without a plugin
[03:27:04] <JBreit> know of any examples of a sticky header that uses the clone method?
[03:34:44] <felixjet> anyone know a sort plugin with drag&drop?
[03:34:49] <felixjet> and please, no jquery UI xd
[03:36:18] <ReBa1> JBreit: I'm using such thing too, and I just replace the space with a padding-top or something on the body
[03:36:47] <ReBa1> That way you don't have to clone
[03:38:39] <ReBa1> My question: I have a similar bar at the top, but with an animated scroll. I'm encountering a problem when I start scrolling. It's like it first goes to the top of the page, immediately back to my last position and then starts to scroll animated to the desired object. Has anyone had this problem or does someone knows a solution?
[03:39:07] <ReBa1> I don't understand why it goes up -> back to the last position (in a flash) -> animated scroll to the desired position
[03:42:54] <shoky> JBreit: move the $body.addClass("scroll")  to before the $head.addClass("toTheCenter")...
[03:43:49] <shoky> JBreit: and i'd change the margin-top to padding-top
[03:44:18] <JBreit> on which element?
[03:44:40] <shoky> JBreit: on body.scroll
[03:44:53] <lemonsparrow> http://pastebin.com/ZqbfrWjK can anyone help me with this
[03:45:44] <JBreit> cool :)
[03:45:45] <JBreit> thanks
[03:46:42] <JBreit> just need to look into smoothing out how it drops in place it looks like
[03:47:30] <shoky> i think that's just a matter of getting the padding just the right size
[03:47:40] <JBreit> hmmm
[03:47:50] <shoky> maybe it's more than that tho adunno
[03:48:04] <JBreit> it also has that weird snap when you scrol back up and the original header placement is displayed
[03:48:12] <JBreit> kind of has a bounce or omething
[03:49:25] <shoky> JBreit: mm switch the order of the removeClass too, the first 2 lines in endScrollClass
[03:49:36] <shoky> not sure, but maybe that makes it a bit smoother
[03:49:50] <JBreit> scroll last?
[03:50:00] <JBreit> after toTheCenter you mean
[03:50:10] <shoky> yeah just switch the 2 lines
[03:50:24] <JBreit> like 1st in last out basically
[03:50:28] <JBreit> gotcha
[03:50:30] <shoky> yeah
[03:51:39] <shoky> well actually FILO would mean moving the $nav line to be first, but i dont think that'll do much
[03:52:09] <shoky> nevermind
[03:53:22] <JBreit> still kind of proud of myself for a first real DOM manipulation
[03:53:25] <JBreit> :D
[03:53:45] <shoky> yep good job ;p
[03:53:58] <raj> I want for a change in a checkbox to make a change in the URL (which then uses the onstatechange to do a GET request). However, to re-implement the checkbox's state when loading the page (onstatechange if ajax loaded page, or on hard page load), I want to use the URL to set the checkbox. How can I prevent onstatechange from setting the checkbox when originates the setting of the URL?
[03:54:15] <JBreit> only stuff I learned in school was "install lightbox"  "install jQuery UI tabs & accordions" and crap
[03:54:15] <JBreit> D:
[03:54:20] <raj> I understand that I can have two functions for onstatechange, one that sets the checkbox and one that doesn't. But what if I have other inputs that have a similar issue? I'm not expected to have an unlimited number of onstatechange functions to handle every case, right?
[03:54:32] <JBreit> and a whole lot of here eat this ActionScript and like it :/
[03:56:08] <JBreit> ths project is going to have a good bit of firsts tho
[03:56:17] <JBreit> gotta figure out a cms for the 1st time too
[03:56:18] <lemonsparrow> http://pastebin.com/ZqbfrWjK can anyone help me with this JBreit
[03:56:34] <JBreit> can try.  I am a newb tho
[03:59:02] <shoky> lemonsparrow: try .prop  instead of .attr
[03:59:32] <shoky> lemonsparrow: actually.. just do $('#status').val(ind)
[03:59:46] <shoky> no need for that switch
[04:00:02] <JBreit> haven't workd with switch cases much other than some in Python
[04:00:32] <JBreit> ind does = index though right?  Sorry for asking newb questions.  Just trying to learn as I go :)
[04:00:41] <shoky> not according to his switch code
[04:00:52] <shoky> case 7, case 14, etc..
[04:01:11] <shoky> those are the values, not indices
[04:01:35] <obert> hello, how to show the url in the browser to can use internal anchors, please? http://ramacciotti.altervista.org/gallery/js/load-content.js  demo: http://ramacciotti.altervista.org/gallery/
[04:02:34] <lemonsparrow> shoky: thanks
[04:03:06] <raj> no one for a concept question? :|
[04:03:21] <lemonsparrow> shoky: prop works :)
[04:03:34] <shoky> lemonsparrow: yes but you don't need any of that code
[04:03:44] <shoky> lemonsparrow: your whole code could be summed up with:  $('#status').val(ind)
[04:03:51] <shoky> that's the proper way to select an option
[04:04:02] <shoky> just by setting the select's value to the option's value
[04:05:08] <shoky> raj: whatcha mean by having two functions for onstatechange?
[04:09:11] <raj> one where onstatechange --> the checkbox being set, and one where it doesn't
[04:09:27] <raj> the latter being when the checkbox set the URL
[04:12:37] <ReBa1> http://jsfiddle.net/73vNU/1/ works in safari & chrome, not in firefox... Although it gives a console message "Finished animating"
[04:12:53] <airdem> is there a neat way to determine the position of a specific element in an array of elements?
[04:13:39] <raj> airdem, .indexOf()
[04:14:02] <airdem> raj, thank you very much
[04:14:20] <raj> np
[04:14:44] <raj> ... shoky, not such an easy one, huh?
[04:26:40] <DukeDrake> bekommen
[04:50:42] <joroci> what is the fastest way to loop through elements and check if one of them contains text?
[04:52:05] <Cork> $().is(':empty')
[04:52:35] <Cork> if any of them is empty it will be true
[04:53:03] <joroci> i wasn't clear
[04:53:09] <joroci> i need to check if they contain a string
[04:53:25] <joroci> specific string that is
[04:53:26] <Cork> you mean find element based on a specific string?
[04:53:32] <joroci> yea
[04:53:35] <Cork> well no you can't do that fast
[04:53:45] <joroci> that's why i said fastest :)
[04:53:47] <Cork> as you will actually have to check every single element to know
[04:53:55] <Cork> add a class to the element
[04:54:00] <Cork> that is the fastest way
[04:55:59] <joroci> i was thinking $('.class:conatins("string")') or each loop
[04:56:34] <joroci> $('.class:conatins("string")') check for length or $.each and check every item
[05:00:27] <Cork> joroci: contains is slower then filter()
[05:00:47] <Cork> opps i missed to submit the line >_<
[05:01:51] <Cork> joroci: $().filter(function() { return.text().indexOf("string") !== -1 })
[05:02:39] <joroci> thx
[05:04:05] <joroci> this.text()?
[05:05:02] <Cork> ...
[05:05:07] <Cork> return $(this).text()
[05:05:09] <Cork> sorry >_<
[05:05:19] <joroci> it will stop when true
[05:05:20] <joroci> ?
[05:05:24] <Cork> no
[05:05:28] <joroci> i will stop it ;)
[05:05:32] <Cork> it will return the elements where it matches
[05:05:40] <Cork> you can't really do that
[05:06:04] <joroci> if it's equal return ?
[05:06:15] <Cork> you could do it all in an each loop i guess
[05:06:22] <Cork> just loop all the elements you have
[05:06:31] <Cork> and then check in an if case
[05:06:41] <Cork> and when it is done do return false;
[05:06:48] <joroci> yea was thinking maybe there's a better way
[05:06:55] <Cork> there isn't
[05:07:06] <Cork> how ever you do it you will have to loop all elements in js
[05:07:16] <Cork> cause there is no selectors for contents
[05:07:31] <Cork> and that is why i suggested using classes
[05:07:39] <joroci> yea i'm using classes
[05:07:54] <joroci> i will loop through the classe
[05:07:58] <joroci> classes
[05:08:11] <Cork> no i meant instead of selecting based on content in the element
[05:08:30] <Cork> add that info as classes and then just query the class combination
[05:08:51] <Cork> if speed is really important
[05:09:02] <joroci> oh
[05:09:22] <blez> insertAfter() doesn't seem to work on IE
[05:09:39] <Cork> should work just fine
[05:17:53] <joroci> thanks cork
[05:20:44] <Serdar> does this work JQuery.data('#' + ticket.ID, "closedBy", "x");?
[05:21:10] <raj> I want to use a function as an eventhandler, but also to just be executed by me with my own object argument (not the `event` argument passed to the eventhandler) ... how can I do this?
[05:21:43] <Cork> Serdar: no
[05:21:56] <Cork> you can have data({}) though
[05:22:15] <Cork> but that will remove all original data if there was any
[05:22:45] <Cork> raj: eventhandler.call(target)
[05:22:58] <Cork> raj: and if it needs event eventhandler.call(target, event)
[05:23:14] <Serdar> Cork, this is the example I saw on jquery.data page: jQuery.data( document.body, "bar", "test" );
[05:23:32] <Serdar> why not replace document.body with ID?
[05:23:43] <Cork> Serdar: ah, so you mean for the stand alone calleer
[05:23:50] <Cork> Serdar: still no :)
[05:23:56] <Serdar> wah
[05:24:06] <Cork> you can do jQuery.data($('id')[0], key, value)
[05:24:26] <Cork> though $('id').data(key, value) is prob easier to read
[05:25:52] <raj> Cork, that just sets `this` as `target`?
[05:25:57] <Serdar> when I understand this correctly, then $('#123456').data("closedBy", "x"); should set closedBy with x for <div id="#123456" ...></div> right?
[05:26:09] <raj> ...and target being the object argument I wanted passed?
[05:26:11] <Cork> ?mdn call
[05:26:12] <b-ot> Cork: Function.prototype.call() - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[05:26:21] <Cork> raj: read up :)
[05:26:32] <Cork> Serdar: yes
[05:28:28] <Serdar> and for my example I can use it with $('#123456').closedBy as read?
[05:28:43] <Serdar> for my understanding data will be used for set
[05:28:49] <Cork> no
[05:28:54] <Serdar> hm
[05:29:06] <Cork> you use data() if you want to set or read
[05:29:10] <raj> oh, you're saying do $('#me').on('click', eventhandler.call(something)) ?
[05:29:16] <Cork> no
[05:29:18] <Cork> ...
[05:29:26] <Cork> $('#me').on('click', eventhandler)
[05:29:39] <Cork> eventhandler.call($('#other')[0])
[05:29:44] <Serdar> this language is killing me
[05:29:55] <Cork> Serdar: it isn't the language
[05:30:02] <Cork> it is just how jquery functions are added
[05:30:22] <Cork> Serdar: jquery has an internal object, it keeps the elements as a reference for data you store on it
[05:30:34] <Cork> Serdar: you access this object through the .data() function
[05:30:40] <Cork> it is as simple as that
[05:30:46] <Cork> don't over complicate it
[05:32:38] <Serdar> I never used JS,JQuery or HTML5 before few months ago. I saw the syntax and told me, oh it looks like C...
[05:32:44] <raj> I currently have `function eventhandler(someAssocArrayObj){ /* doStuff(someAssocArrayObj) */}` ... how can I use this function as an eventhandler?
[05:32:59] <Cork> Serdar: and it is
[05:33:22] <Cork> Serdar: think of the data stored as a private value on the class
[05:33:32] <Cork> Serdar: and data() is an access function you use to modify it
[05:33:48] <Cork> Serdar: it take the key, and an optional value
[05:33:58] <Cork> and it returns the value for the key
[05:34:00] <Serdar> Cork, I do and normally I initiate the clas and call the private value within the object
[05:34:16] <Cork> Serdar: well that is if you had access to it
[05:34:23] <Cork> but you are from external code
[05:35:00] <Serdar> what do you mean with external code? I am using the same client.js to add/remove some dom elements
[05:35:14] <Serdar> and in this case to store
[05:35:17] <Cork> Serdar: you are calling things from outside jquery
[05:35:41] <Cork> so you are limited to the public functions that jquery expose for modifying the data
[05:37:03] <Serdar> it would be internal if I had used the "options" alternative?
[05:37:14] <Cork> no
[05:37:24] <Cork> cause the option would be internal to the dialog
[05:37:45] <Serdar> and the dialog is part of JQuery?
[05:37:49] <Cork> Serdar: i don't get why you hate accessing the data through the access functions
[05:37:55] <Cork> Serdar: jquery ui
[05:38:02] <Serdar> I don't hate it
[05:38:06] <Cork> Serdar: but remember jquery isn't a language
[05:38:08] <Serdar> I don'T understand
[05:38:10] <Cork> it is a framework
[05:38:35] <Cork> Serdar: to store data on an element do $(elm).data('key', 'value')
[05:38:45] <Cork> Serdar: to access it $(elm).data('key')
[05:38:51] <Cork> that's it
[05:38:54] <Serdar> oh
[05:39:18] <Serdar> but this is local to elm?
[05:39:30] <Cork> no it is local to jquery
[05:39:46] <Cork> but jquery base the reference on the element
[05:40:14] <Cork> basically it internally do (psudo code) return dataStore[elm];
[05:40:16] <Serdar> $(elm1).data('key', 'value1'); $(elm2).data('key', 'value2');
[05:40:33] <Serdar> I ask because of this do I change both time the same key?
[05:40:44] <Cork> yes
[05:41:03] <Cork> opps
[05:41:07] <Cork> missed the elm2 there
[05:41:09] <Cork> then no
[05:41:32] <Serdar> ah okay, than it was (more or less) correct, if I say it is local to elm
[05:41:33] <Cork> $(elm1).data('key', 'value1'); $(elm1).data().key = 'value1'; are the same thing
[05:41:56] <Cork> data just keeps an object ({}) with the element as the key
[05:42:05] <Cork> and when you set and read keys it is from that object
[05:43:19] <Serdar> if I remove an elm, then the store in JQuery for this elm will be removed too?
[05:43:54] <Serdar> if I use the JQuery remove() for sure.
[05:43:56] <Cork> yes
[05:44:36] <Serdar> understand.
[06:07:55] <Larsibarsi> How can I read the position the web page has been scrolled down to?
[06:08:20] <Cork> window.scrollY
[06:08:27] <Cork> or elm.scrollTop if it isn't the window
[06:09:00] <Larsibarsi> and can I check if an element (in this case a <div>-element) has left the viewport?
[06:09:25] <Cork> $('div').offset().top < 0
[06:09:46] <Cork> oh right
[06:09:49] <Larsibarsi> Oho, that's great and fast! Thank you!
[06:09:59] <Cork> ($('div').offset().top + $('div').height()) < 0
[06:10:12] <Cork> that is for if it is scroll up over the top
[06:10:20] <Cork> you would have to do similar math for the bottom too
[06:10:24] <Larsibarsi> Yup, I thought that the height shoul dbe in there somehow...
[06:10:45] <Larsibarsi> What I didn't knew was the .offset()-function.
[06:15:38] <Serdar> Cork, thank you
[06:29:32] <dantxo> Hello, I have a $.get inside a for, such as for(x in catalog) { item = catalog[x]; $.get(url, {'item': item}, function () { console.log(item) }); } inside the callback function item is the last element inside the catalog array. How can I access or how can I pass a variable that is defined inside the for loop to use it in the callback function?
[06:30:28] <Cork> man this question keeps coming up again and again today...
[06:30:42] <Cork> dantxo: for doesn't create a scope
[06:31:02] <Cork> so x or variables you define in it won't be unique for each loop
[06:31:22] <Cork> dantxo: simplest solution is prob to use $.each instead of for
[06:31:28] <Cork> ?api jquery.each
[06:31:29] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.each(): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[06:32:34] <dantxo> alright
[06:32:40] <dantxo> thanks
[06:47:14] <gavrochel> Hi. How can I access data from inside a ajax success function, outside the function?
[06:47:43] <Cork> gavrochel: basically you can't
[06:47:51] <Cork> without risking race situations
[06:48:06] <Cork> gavrochel: the callback function is called when the response comes back
[06:48:14] <Cork> and that is "somewhere in the future"
[06:48:25] <Cork> so your function has exited long since when that happens
[06:48:28] <seutje> u could do a doc.rdy-style derpy timer, but you probably don't want to
[06:49:39] <gavrochel> ok. thanks
[06:53:27] <ph88> when there are two UI actions that change the same stuff in the database on the server. Do you guys lock the UI until the one of the actions is complete? Or how do you handle actions not interfering with each other ?
[06:57:57] <Cork> ph88: there are several ways to handle it
[06:58:16] <Cork> 1. time stamp, if you are too old tell them to try again
[06:58:23] <Cork> 2. if you can send data back out
[06:58:33] <Cork> update the site with what the current state is
[06:59:12] <Cork> there are most likely more options but can't say without looking closer at the exact situation
[07:00:39] <ph88> i think some things are allowed to be processed out of order, and some other things have to wait for other things to complete ...
[07:00:46] <ph88> so it's a complicated situation ..
[07:01:31] <ph88> then each action also has several steps, for example:   Mouse down ... drag .... mouse up             lot's of stuff can have happened and depending on the phase (step) of the action it should respond differently o_O
[07:18:35] <raj> I have a function that is already functional on its own. However, now I would like to use it as an eventhandler. How can I do this? http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/A4t8A/
[07:19:59] <shoky> raj with an anonymous function or with .bind
[07:21:31] <raj> shoky, sorry, I meant without an anonymous function
[07:22:10] <lasha> just padd the name of the function
[07:22:18] <lasha> instead of an anonymous function
[07:22:24] <lasha> pass*
[07:22:27] <shoky> raj ok then with bind
[07:22:58] <shoky> (which is really pretty much the same thing)
[07:23:22] <shoky> well,kinda.
[07:23:50] <shoky> raj also you can make it a named function if you want :P
[07:26:12] <jAyenGreen> I'm doing something fundamentally wrong. This paste shows basic html with a table, and the jquery to make the table body sortable. The jquery, jquery.ui and jquery.cookie versions are as of today. Chrome shows them loaded. No errors. But not draggable. I notice in listeners I see nothing like sortable like there is draggable.
[07:26:17] <jAyenGreen> http://pastebin.com/SqrKkg4z
[07:26:56] <libin> can someone please tell why what is the mistake in this json please:  http://textdump.net/read/3487/
[07:27:40] <raj> shoky, you mean http://api.jquery.com/bind/ ?
[07:27:41] <libin> I have got a master node called users, and in that there will be different users, and each user has different properties
[07:27:43] <raj> or the js one?
[07:27:51] <shoky> raj the js one
[07:29:12] <raj> can you show me in the fiddle?
[07:29:41] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/A4t8A/1/
[07:30:00] <libin> can someone please tell me what is the syntax error in my json please
[07:30:15] <libin> http://textdump.net/read/3487/
[07:31:02] <shoky> jAyenGreen: seems ok?  http://jsfiddle.net/rh462/
[07:31:55] <shoky> libin: in the 4th line you have an array inside an object {[ .. ]}   that's invalid
[07:32:19] <shoky> libin: and then you're closing it with   }]   ...
[07:32:35] <Aprendiz1234_> hi all. I have a problem with an ID. The ID contain < inside the string(expand-7->50) and it fails when I want to get its value. is there any problem with < n the ID?
[07:32:37] <shoky> drop the inner arrays
[07:33:08] <libin> ok shoky try that
[07:33:29] <felixjet> what should be used for a <a href="#" class="jquery-selector"> ?
[07:33:35] <shoky> Aprendiz1234_:  if you want to use it in the jquery function $('#id_here')  then you need to escape the <  with two backslashes \\<
[07:33:36] <felixjet> "#", javascript:void(0)... ?
[07:33:56] <felixjet> if the link doesnt have a href, what should it have?
[07:34:02] <shoky> libin: what?
[07:34:31] <raj> so if I want `event`, I have to do handler.bind(event, someObj)`?
[07:34:38] <libin> sorry, i meant i will try
[07:34:41] <raj> and get event from `this`?
[07:35:03] <shoky> raj: no, event argument will be after the somearg argument
[07:35:22] <shoky> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/A4t8A/2/
[07:36:03] <raj> oh wow
[07:36:07] <raj> thanks!
[07:36:10] <Aprendiz1234_> shoky: ok, thank you
[07:38:19] <raj> shoky, are .call and .apply usable for this as well?
[07:39:26] <jAyenGreen> shaky: On my screen, the fiddle is the same as my page... the rows just highlight if I try to drag. Could it be mac chrome?
[07:39:40] <shoky> raj: nope, those actually call the function
[07:40:11] <shoky> jAyenGreen: the fiddle doesn't work for you either?
[07:40:23] <libin> shoky : I have got the json as valid now : http://pastebin.com/286UedEp
[07:40:39] <raj> ok, I won't even ask how .bind pulls that off
[07:40:42] <jAyenGreen> shaky: no, anywhere on either row the cursor is a text bar, and dragging just highlights the text
[07:40:46] <raj> thanks
[07:40:47] <libin> but however when i create a class out of it , it does not look right
[07:41:05] <shoky> raj:  just like an anonymous function can pull it off
[07:41:13] <libin> if you try that json in this http://json2csharp.com/ , it looks weired
[07:41:26] <shoky> json2csharp?  i don't even...
[07:41:57] <libin> thats ok, thanks anyways shoky
[07:43:34] <jAyenGreen> shaky: works in firefox. interesting.
[07:44:09] <Xal_> I have a .load() function that has a Deferred.resolve in its callback. The file IS being loaded and inserted, but for some reason the callback isn't being run. Does anyone have any idea why this might be happening?
[07:44:27] <shoky> jAyenGreen: well, table rows have never been very friendly with dynamic modification in a clean cross-browser way, so i'm not surprised you're having issues
[07:44:53] <Guest20878> how to set the value of a hidden form field by jQuery. The form filed has an id of #abc
[07:44:58] <shoky> Xal_: show some code
[07:45:14] <shoky> Guest20878: same as a non-hidden form field
[07:47:19] <jAyenGreen> shaky: so better to use div's and float for the tabular data?
[07:48:31] <shoky> jAyenGreen: i'm not sure really what's the best solution for doing that with tabular data.. i'd probably go with divs tho yeah
[07:49:27] <Guest20878> shoky,  looks like $('#taskid-input-field').val("123"); does not sets its value
[07:49:40] <shoky> `demo @ Guest20878
[07:49:40] <b-ot> Guest20878: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:49:44] <jAyenGreen> shaky: cool. ok, thanks!
[07:50:02] <Guest20878> shoky,  demo http://jsfiddle.net/t23FP/1/
[07:50:08] <Xal_> ... nm. Just found the problem. :/
[07:50:16] <Guest20878> shoky,  line 2
[07:50:35] <Xal_> It was being called. Stupid basic JS error.
[07:51:32] <shoky> Guest20878: works fine
[07:51:36] <Velveeta> guest20878: works for me too
[07:51:45] <Velveeta> hullo shoky
[07:51:56] <shoky> Guest20878: don't look at the browser's DOM/elements view to see the changed value in the <input> tag
[07:51:59] <shoky> hey Velveeta
[07:52:06] <Guest20878> shoky,  no. the correct syntax is $('input[name=hiddeninputname]').val(theValue);
[07:52:14] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  ^
[07:52:15] <Velveeta> i feel like we should have some kind of seinfeld/newman rivalry going on
[07:52:16] <shoky> Guest20878: wrong
[07:52:24] <shoky> lol
[07:52:34] <shoky> Guest20878: your fiddle is changing the value just fine
[07:52:38] <Guest20878> shoky> Guest20878: don't look at the browser's DOM/elements view to see the changed value in the <input> tag ?
[07:52:38] <Velveeta> right
[07:52:48] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  iam right or wrong
[07:52:59] <shoky> Guest20878: i was assuming that's why you said its not working
[07:52:59] <Velveeta> guest20878: the fiddle you posted works fine
[07:53:38] <Guest20878> shoky,  Velveeta  it just alerts the set value . but is it really set the value as the VALUE of the form filed?
[07:53:43] <shoky> yes it really does
[07:53:45] <Velveeta> yes
[07:53:54] <Velveeta> i inspected the dom and visually verified it
[07:53:55] <Guest20878> I keep on getting HTTP Status 400 - Required int parameter 'taskId' is not present
[07:54:06] <Velveeta> that's not a javascript error
[07:54:45] <shoky> also your <input> in the fiddle doesn't have a name, nor have you a <form> :P
[07:54:54] <Velveeta> right
[07:55:04] <Velveeta> i just reopened it to take a look at the field name
[07:58:01] <Guest20878> hm
[07:58:24] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  i wonder I why I cant see the hidden form field in dom at all
[07:59:01] <Velveeta> jsfiddle uses iframes to load its content, you may not be looking in the right place

[08:17:55] <yolobro> anhyhone here that can help?#
[08:20:09] <jedimind> yolobro tons of people who can help
[08:20:15] <jedimind> but none of whom are psychic unfortunately
[08:20:28] <yolobro> tell me what would u need to have in order to do that?
[08:20:28] <jedimind> not to lack of effort, mind oyu
[08:20:38] <jedimind> well, your code for starters
[08:20:47] <jedimind> preferrably in a testcase on jsfiddle.net
[08:20:51] <jedimind> with the problem replicated
[08:20:59] <raj> yolobro, you left out the return statement
[08:22:00] <yolobro> so i need to put the return statement back in columns
[08:22:00] <yolobro> ?
[08:25:43] <yolobro> raj: could i have like 	return null; 	}  	// Global dw private data goes here  	// dw scope public 	return { that or i need to start another if and have that return in it?
[08:27:02] <ronaldjadams> whres the party at?
[08:30:06] <raj> yolobro, http://jsfiddle.net
[08:30:14] <raj> I'm not clear on what you're tryig to do
[08:30:55] <yolobro> in this line do u see any problem : <script type="text/javascript"><!--  		jQuery(document).ready(function() { 			jQuery("div.navgroup h2").click(function(e) { 				jQuery(this).toggleClass("collapsed"); 				jQuery(this).nextAll("ul").toggle(); 			}); 		}); 	--></script>
[08:34:40] <raj> yolobro, what's it mean to toggle a <ul>?
[08:34:44] <BillCriswell> yolobro: No reason fro the <!-- --> or the type="text/javascript"
[08:35:00] <BillCriswell> raj: Just makes it visible if it's hidden and vice-versa.
[08:35:12] <raj> ahh
[08:38:41] <raj> I am currently using `data` in an ajax callback to build some elements. I would additionally like for these elements to be loaded on doc ready, without an ajax call. I can have my templating engine put the necessary data in a data-attribute on <div id='content'> ... does that seem reasonable?
[08:40:02] <airdem> do i use $.ajax if i want to store the returning html from an url into a variable or is there any better function for this?
[08:40:56] <BillCriswell> Damn, wanted to use lowsrc but it's obsolete. =(
[08:41:26] <raj> airdem, there's .load()
[08:50:19] <vedic> Hello Friends, I need guidance. I am scraping the content from a site (with permission), say the site is S1. And want to allow users of my site say site S2 to be able to send messages to the original users of site S1. I do not want the users of site S2 to get redirected or see any promotion of S1 anywhere.
[08:50:20] <vedic> Is there any way I can embedded the form of the S1 on to S2 and allow posting directly to S1.
[08:55:46] <airdem> is it possible that .prop() does not work with custom data-xyz="" attributes?
[08:56:48] <airdem> .attr() works fine

[09:01:23] <shoky> airdem: .prop is not supposed to work with attributes
[09:01:38] <BillCriswell> nafta: You mean from a list of images in HTML you want the file names?
[09:01:43] <airdem> shoky, oh i though attr is depr. and gets replaced by prop :P
[09:01:47] <airdem> *thought
[09:02:19] <shoky> airdem: no, not at all
[09:02:41] <shoky> airdem: for reading data-xxx attributes you can also use .data()
[09:03:51] <BillCriswell> nafta: http://jsfiddle.net/Uh46v/1/ helpful?
[09:06:24] <airdem> could it be that some website do not allow requesting via $.get ? i get empty response but if i visit the page manually it just works

[09:07:34] <airdem> $.get('http://www.freewhois.us/index.php?query=google.de&submit=Whois
[09:07:34] <airdem> ', function(data) { do stuff }); gives me an empty response
[09:08:28] <airdem> Berto, check out jQueryUI or search for "jQuery live search plugin"
[09:08:58] <Berto> thanks airdem
[09:08:59] <joro> berto jquery autocomplete
[09:09:03] <joro> can do that
[09:09:11] <joro> jqueryui autocomplete
[09:09:50] <Berto> joro, that's sweet.  I think this is more along the lines i want: http://jsfiddle.net/sushanth009/yMBYa/3/
[09:11:40] <joro> you can combine them
[09:13:05] <BillCriswell> joro: http://redotheweb.com/2013/05/15/client-side-full-text-search-in-css.html this might interest you guys haha
[09:13:49] <Berto> BillCriswell, ooh that's really nice too.  Thanks joro, airdem, BillCriswell  -- tons to play with
[09:14:07] <airdem> Berto, enjoy
[09:14:56] <joro> cool
[09:19:43] <shoky> airdem: you can't load something from a third-party site with ajax, unless the server is configured to allow it
[09:20:22] <airdem> shoky, found another site that allows to load the data via json, thanks for clarifying though
[09:21:15] <vedic> I need guidance. How to show a form from third party site on to another site (say site S1) so that the data entered into site S1 gets submitted to site third party site. I have full control of S1 and taken due permission from third party to use their form for sending messages from site S1 users.
[09:24:25] <vedic> Is iframe the right solution?
[09:25:18] <shoky> sure
[09:25:22] <tgodar> that could be an option.
[09:25:43] <vedic> tgodar: Do you mean there are other good options?
[09:25:53] <tgodar> I don't like depending on others that way usually though and whould use my own form and make a POST from server side
[09:26:16] <vedic> shoky: Could you direct me to some tutorial?
[09:26:23] <tgodar> do they offer an API or just want you to POST to same location as their form?
[09:26:38] <nafta> BillCriswell: bro, I need some help with this...if any of you guys could give me a hand. I'm loading the images from a php script that I call thru ajax... (thought this was better option than what we were trying to do)....the problem is...I trigger some stuff when this images get clicked...if they are in the html...they work perfectly....but if I print them thru ajax...the trigger stops working...
[09:27:08] <tgodar> nafta, aware of 'on' binding with jQuery?
[09:27:08] <shoky> vedic: for an iframe? <iframe src="http://othersite/the_form"></iframe>   donno if a tutorial
[09:27:13] <shoky> *of
[09:27:17] <airdem> is there any little tool i could use to print human readable json objects?
[09:27:45] <nafta> tgodar: no idea
[09:27:47] <nafta> what do you mean?
[09:27:53] <tgodar> nafta: read something like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1359018/in-jquery-how-to-attach-events-to-dynamic-html-elements
[09:28:03] <vedic> tgodar: The only reason I don't want to send data from browser to S1 server and then to third party is that third party doesn't allow data from certain IP addresses and proxies and I don't want S1 server IP getting blocked in future thinking robots are pushing content to their sites.
[09:28:16] <shoky> airdem: JSON.stringify(obj, 0, 2)
[09:28:29] <nafta> BillCriswell tgodar -> http://jsfiddle.net/KYBek/
[09:28:32] <vedic> tgodar: No, they don't offer API. It is just sending post to same location as their form
[09:29:12] <vedic> tgodar: If the data is going directly from the  browser then there should not be any issue for third party site to not accept it or block it
[09:29:45] <tgodar> vedic: not sure I follow that, the IP for the refering POST would be whatever the client IP was used to load the page
[09:30:10] <tgodar> ...not your servers
[09:30:22] <vedic> tgodar: It is a bootstrap strategy for site S1 to get more results (so the users) appearing on the site. Actual content is of third party
[09:31:50] <vedic> tgodar: Is a user is coming to site S1 and submitting that form, it will be his IP address and cookies etc that will be used for submission but if I send the data back to S1 server and then do crafted posting to third party, S1 server's IP is involved.
[09:32:12] <vedic> Is => If
[09:32:53] <vedic> tgodar: Do you also suggest iframe is the good way
[09:33:12] <tgodar> not sure what else would do what you are describing
[09:33:33] <vedic> and can I control iframe from S1 site's jquery. This is needed to hide the promotions made by third party on their form
[09:34:34] <tgodar> no, that would I think violate same origin policy, effectively cross site scripting
[09:35:34] <vedic> tgodar: Any other way? JSONP?
[09:35:55] <tgodar> API, JSONP, or basically parse form (think scrape) and add it to your iframe
[09:36:52] <vedic> tgodar: didn't get.
[09:37:07] <vedic> Could you explain a bit
[09:37:22] <tgodar> vedic: read  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/364952/jquery-javascript-accessing-contents-of-an-iframe
[09:38:09] <tgodar> vedic, can you explain more why you don't want to use say cURL and make the post from your server?
[09:38:35] <BillCriswell> nafta: What is the issue?
[09:40:24] <vedic> tgodar: Because this a temporary arrangement I have got from them and third party server is configured to learn from request IP address and is able to block (including proxies) if continuously post requests are coming from the same or group of same ip addresses
[09:41:15] <vedic> tgodar: I will be paying them to get their permission of embedding form
[09:41:55] <tgodar> that seems counterproductive... but I get ya
[09:42:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> nafta: you there?
[09:49:28] <RavenHursT> So, I'm using delegations for the first time.. and I've run into something that I'm having a hard time figuring out... using .on(), when bubbling up to the element that you set the delegator on, how can I get that element inside of the closure w/o having to walk the DOM again?  Is it in the event object somewhere?  http://pastebin.com/KvPEZr8y
[09:49:58] <shoky> RavenHursT:  this
[09:50:11] <joro> yep
[09:50:29] <RavenHursT> shoky: Tried that.. $(this) gives me the target.. not the root element that the delegator is sitting on..
[09:51:39] <RavenHursT> shoky & joro: in the pastebin example above.. $(this) gives me the li's.. not #myRootElem
[09:51:59] <joro> $(this).parent()
[09:52:29] <shoky> RavenHursT: oh you want the root. e.delegateTarget
[09:52:31] <RavenHursT> joro.. nope.. lol.. I think I just found it.. e.delegateTarget
[09:52:41] <RavenHursT> lol.. shoky.. I JUST saw it in the console..
[09:52:46] <shoky> ;p
[09:53:04] <RavenHursT> thanks guys.. just needed to look for 30 more secs.. hate it when that happens.. (doh!)
[10:12:33] <Croves> Is there a way to get the first element after the only one who's visible? Like, I have 3 divs, the first one is visible and the others are hidden. I need to get, in this case, the seccond div
[10:22:23] <Mo0O> hi there, could you please help me to understand why this http://jsfiddle.net/4G8x5/ doesn't work as expected? it's the JQuery example from http://api.jqueryui.com/color-animation/
[10:22:23] <BillCriswell> Croves: $('div:visible').first().next()
[10:22:56] <Croves> Thank you BillCriswell
[10:23:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> hey guys
[10:24:03] <Mosselman> hi
[10:24:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyone heard of normalize css
[10:24:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> normalize.css
[10:24:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> and if so is it of any use?
[10:24:46] <shoky> Mo0O: you need to include jquery ui
[10:24:47] <obert> if you like tools, yes you can use it
[10:25:13] <Mo0O> shoky: thanks a lot :)
[10:26:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> obert: was that for me? (what does it do, descrip. wasnt very clear how it works)
[10:29:14] <obert> Rohan_Bhangui: apart that there are tons of articles in the web about it, it is a reset tool for CSS
[10:29:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhh okay
[10:29:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> wait a sec
[10:29:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> you know the issue where fonts look really bad on chrome
[10:29:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> very bad as in bad antialiasing
[10:30:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> obert: would normalize.css fix that?
[10:30:40] <obert> doubt full
[10:30:57] <obert> text-rendering perhaps it is what you are searching, also #css
[10:34:16] <earcaraxe> when i $('.geartext').get(i).hide(); it fails because it says its a div element and not a jquery object
[10:34:49] <earcaraxe> since $('.geartext') is a jquery collection i thought i could use .get with an index to pull an object that could use jquery methods
[10:35:21] <earcaraxe> any suggestions for how to get an object out of a jquery collection that i can run .show() and .hide() on?
[10:36:01] <joroci> $($('.geartext').get(i)).hide();
[10:36:12] <earcaraxe> thank you!
[10:36:31] <joroci> np
[10:37:11] <joroci> it's him again
[10:37:14] <joroci> :P
[10:52:12] <pthreat> small css related question, I need the middle div to auto adjust to the contents inside of it http://jsfiddle.net/z9kVx/2/
[10:52:41] <pthreat> I ask in this channel because of the fact everyone at #css is idle
[10:53:04] <Ungy> are you dynamically loading it?
[10:53:22] <Ungy> or is it loaded at the state of the pages initial load?
[10:54:18] <pthreat> Ungy: It's just pure css
[10:54:40] <Ungy> width: auto
[10:55:03] <Ungy> but that will not allow for a stretch if there is constraints on teh parent objects
[10:55:10] <tfittsy> I have a jquery mobile page where after submitting a form the next page is unable to load anything new.  even static links won't work.  any ideas what would cause this?
[10:56:48] <pthreat> Ungy: http://jsfiddle.net/z9kVx/2/ nope
[10:57:18] <tfittsy> n/m, I got it.
[10:58:15] <Ungy> pthreat so you want teh green box to be the same as teh red box?
[10:58:47] <pthreat> Nah. I want the black box to auto adjust it's contents to what it has
[10:59:07] <Ungy> umm what black box?
[10:59:59] <Ungy> you mean the mddle?
[11:00:12] <pthreat> div.pager div.middle{ which has a black border
[11:00:23] <Ungy> not on the one you sent me
[11:00:27] <obert> the selector is useless
[11:00:27] <Ungy> but OK whatever
[11:00:49] <obert> pthreat:
[11:00:56] <pthreat> what?
[11:00:57] <Ungy> pthreat are your left and right fixed width?
[11:01:06] <pthreat> yes
[11:01:19] <pthreat> as it's stated in the code by width:144px
[11:01:31] <lintguy> Hm, why do i get proto array on an array i created??
[11:01:33] <Ungy> correct but your right is not
[11:02:00] <pthreat> div.pager div.right{     float:right;     height:82px;     border:1px solid green;     width:144px; } it is
[11:03:12] <obert> pthreat: the selector is useless.
[11:03:14] <prometh> what would you guys say is "production & asset development"? i'm guessing it means creating html templates, but dunno
[11:03:41] <jp-> anyone seen ie11 crashes with jquery-ui v1.10.3 and autocomplete?
[11:03:45] <pthreat> obert: I like useless things, they guide me. Also, they make sense
[11:03:58] <obert> pthreat: it makes the rendering slower
[11:04:09] <pthreat> Poor me I gues smy site will be slower then :(
[11:04:14] <pthreat> guess, even
[11:04:29] <obert> -.-
[11:04:39] <prometh> poor quality
[11:05:15] <pthreat> Yeah it's not ultra hd, sorry
[11:05:43] <prometh> huh? that's not performance
[11:05:47] <jp-> hmm, n/m, it's not autocomplete. something else causing it when i  .focus() the text field and start typing ie 11 crashes. strange.
[11:06:44] <pthreat> prometh: There's something wrong with you ...
[11:07:01] <prometh> why? cuz i build quality shit?
[11:07:04] <pthreat> prometh: you failed at detecting  sarcasm
[11:07:14] <prometh> ok
[11:07:33] <pthreat> i.e: read as I don't care what you have to say or about your "shit"
[11:07:40] <Ungy> pthreat you mean like this http://jsfiddle.net/z9kVx/3/
[11:07:40] <pthreat> I just came here for a problem
[11:08:11] <prometh> and i'm saying that based on your comment about not caring about having slow code makes you a supporter of low quality
[11:08:16] <pthreat> Ungy, good going but the middle div still has space on it, it doesn't stretches to the contents
[11:08:17] <prometh> which makes you a failed programmer
[11:08:32] <lintguy> Oh how i had wished someone told me not to use var x for in y two days ago!
[11:08:41] <pthreat> I feel bad about myseff prometh I'm a bad programmer
[11:08:52] <prometh> but whatever, dude... maybe i took what you said the wrong way and you can go on not caring all you want
[11:08:55] <webguy024> hello jquery, trying to build a jquery plugin for mockjax in ember. I am missing something with this code -> https://github.com/kenelliott/ember-mockjax/blob/master/jquery.ember-mockjax.js
[11:08:56] <prometh> not caring wont' make you an expert
[11:08:58] <prometh> oh well
[11:09:04] <webguy024> when I run $.emberMockjax I get this error -> http://cl.ly/image/001m0U0A1y3b
[11:09:19] <prometh> you'll never have the pride of a great programmer ;)
[11:09:41] <prometh> now, go back to mcdonalds
[11:09:53] <pthreat> yeah yeah you're right
[11:10:04] * pthreat pats prometh in the back 
[11:10:05] * prometh == superman
[11:11:09] <prometh> too bad general patton's not around anymore
[11:11:15] <prometh> get him to slap you around
[11:11:45] * prometh does cartwheels
[11:13:50] <prometh> what would you guys say is "production & asset development"? i'm guessing it means creating html templates, but dunno
[11:13:52] <Ungy> pthreat http://jsfiddle.net/z9kVx/4/ better?
[11:14:16] <Ungy> prometh could mean lots of things
[11:14:30] <prometh> what do you have in mind?
[11:14:45] <pthreat> Ungy: nice going! I hope that position absolute doesn't fucks up the rest of my css ...
[11:14:59] <Ungy> pthreat all depends on what your doing
[11:15:10] <Ungy> you can do negative margins as well
[11:15:37] <Ungy> pthreat but really you want the middle content to be the star helps with SEO and accessibility
[11:16:19] <Ungy> Prometh I woudl assume it means doing image work creatign newsletters and editing websites
[11:16:38] <prometh> ah, cool
[11:16:40] <prometh> thanks
[11:17:16] <prometh> btw, why use position:absolute? why not just use floats
[11:17:30] <prometh> i arrived late
[11:17:32] <Ungy> pthreat in fact there is lots of ways to do columns it is easy if you do it fixed width but much harder if you have it flexible
[11:17:44] <prometh> use display:table-cell for flexible
[11:17:52] <prometh> or flexbox, but... probably too new
[11:17:53] <pthreat> right, this was the case
[11:17:58] <Ungy> prometh for SEO and accessibility purposes you want your content to be first thing in the document
[11:18:05] <pthreat> I'd just use a table if that would be the case jesus christ
[11:18:16] <prometh> ungy: what do you mean?
[11:18:17] <pthreat> And you call yourself  "pro"
[11:18:30] <prometh> i didn't say use a <table> .. i said display:table-cell
[11:18:32] <pthreat> quality shit? Now I know you were just mocking about yourself
[11:18:45] <prometh> you don't know much about css, do you, pthreat?
[11:18:45] <pthreat> prometh: nice going!
[11:18:50] <Ungy> prometh that is actually worse
[11:19:01] <pthreat> I said that what you said prometh is WORSE
[11:19:10] <pthreat> pr0 57yl3z
[11:19:13] <dmosher_lime> Stupid QUnit question: In my jquery plugin I'm triggering custom events that I want to test are being triggered. Is that possible with Qunit?
[11:19:16] <prometh> i don't even know what you're trying to achieve yet
[11:19:20] <Ungy> anyways when you load a page the first information loaded is at teh top of the page and goes down this is how screen readers and robots behave
[11:19:26] <pthreat> prometh: you never looked at the fiddle did you
[11:19:40] <Ungy> putting yoru content in teh page as a matter of importance helps your site out dramatically
[11:19:44] <prometh> yes, i did... some divs and some links
[11:20:03] <prometh> Ungy: what does that have to do with <divs>? they are ignored
[11:20:20] <Ungy> the contents of the divs are not
[11:20:27] <prometh> exactly
[11:20:28] <Ungy> so your content shoudl be the first thing in the list
[11:20:30] <prometh> so use as many divs as you want
[11:20:36] <prometh> ohh, ok
[11:20:48] <prometh> i see what you're saying now
[11:20:54] <prometh> 3 columns can be a pain
[11:20:58] <prometh> use nesting
[11:21:02] <prometh> and float:right
[11:21:09] <prometh> so content is first
[11:22:01] <Ungy> the best solution i have every seen and I use a variant of is found http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/perfect-3-column.htm
[11:22:13] <prometh> pthreat: what's more important, the left or right column?
[11:22:37] <Ungy> in my solution it matters not he can move them around at will
[11:22:40] <dmosher_lime> Anyone help with QUnit and testing that a custom event is triggered?
[11:22:48] <webguy024> anyone have a jquery plugin how to document that they recommend?
[11:22:54] <Ungy> sorry never used qunit
[11:22:54] <jedimind> holy hell, prometh is alive

[11:29:42] <prometh> $("div:jesus") ?
[11:29:43] <pthreat> Yeah come on what's the sole reason IRC exists damn it so we can say "Have you googled that" sickens me
[11:29:44] <ss_haze> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1566595/can-i-use-multiple-versions-of-jquery-on-the-same-page
[11:29:48] <ss_haze> you see this
[11:29:49] <Ungy> pthreat sorry in Canada they spell things differently here
[11:29:52] <pthreat> $(".jesus")
[11:29:52] <ss_haze> 149 +
[11:29:54] <webguy024> $('#god:first-child")
[11:29:57] <ss_haze> and it doesn't works
[11:30:02] <pthreat> webguy024: hahaha
[11:30:04] <prometh> webguy024: lol
[11:30:04] <ss_haze> what does it says about jquery
[11:30:05] <pthreat> webguy024++
[11:30:07] <ss_haze> pls
[11:30:14] <pthreat> dolan plz
[11:30:33] <ss_haze> I mean I have made inclusions of scripts, but only jquery does this version bs
[11:30:54] <Ungy> ss_haze jquery is an evolving library
[11:30:57] <jaypitidi> i'm trying to check if the first character in a string is 0 with substring but it's not working â€¦â€¦ if(myString.substring(0) == 0){Do Something} is doing nothing
[11:31:01] <pthreat> ss_haze: It's not versioning bullshit if you use old and bad quality plugins attain yourself to the consequences
[11:31:12] <ss_haze> envolving means, sell with time
[11:31:20] <Ungy> pthreat thickbox was great until abotu 3 years ago
[11:31:27] <pthreat> It was I know
[11:31:39] <ss_haze> ok, give alternatives for 1.9.1
[11:31:41] <shoky> jaypitidi:  .substring(0) returns the the whole string
[11:32:08] <jaypitidi> so (0,0)?
[11:32:17] <shoky> 0,1
[11:32:18] <jaypitidi> err 1
[11:32:19] <jaypitidi> lol
[11:32:20] <shoky> or
[11:32:21] <jaypitidi> ok thanks
[11:32:22] <shoky> myString[0]
[11:32:23] <shoky> :P
[11:32:26] <ss_haze> nobody uses thickbox alternatives
[11:32:28] <webguy024> anyone mind telling me what is wrong with this plugin implementation? Not the code inside, but the jquery plugin wrapper code. I get a weird error -> https://github.com/kenelliott/ember-mockjax/blob/master/jquery.ember-mockjax.js
[11:32:29] <ss_haze> ok
[11:32:29] <pthreat> http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/ how about lightbox
[11:32:46] <Ungy> ss_haze I already gave you one
[11:32:47] <ss_haze> ok
[11:32:49] <ss_haze> nice
[11:32:55] <Ungy> http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal
[11:33:03] <Ungy> also there is domwindow
[11:33:19] <pthreat> jquery ui dialog works just fine ...
[11:33:23] <pthreat> It's great
[11:33:30] <webguy024> this my "weird error" http://cl.ly/image/001m0U0A1y3b
[11:34:05] <Ungy> dialogue I use as much as possible if I need something really advanced I use colorbox
[11:34:28] <shoky> webguy024: seems you're calling .emberMockJax on a jquery object like  $('#something').emberMockJax()
[11:34:49] <pthreat> Ungy: http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/example2/ Nice
[11:35:12] <webguy024> hmm.. I don't want to call it on an element.. that is the only call to the plugin that I have made.
[11:35:18] <shoky> webguy024: but you only defined a $.emberMockJax function, which is just a regular function.  you might want to instead make  $.fn.emberMockJax
[11:35:19] <Ungy> yes I found it the best one out there right now
[11:35:22] <shoky> webguy024: oh
[11:35:34] <shoky> webguy024: what code is causing that error..?
[11:35:38] <Ungy> but I don't like using it if dialog does the job
[11:35:45] <webguy024> $.emberMocjax({})
[11:35:50] <webguy024> +k
[11:35:52] <shoky> oh
[11:36:05] <shoky> ok my bad
[11:36:41] <shoky> webguy024: then it looks like you didn't include your script properly, before using it.. or something like that
[11:36:57] <webguy024> it has to be something else with my application that I am trying to use this in. The git repo works. Thanks shoky it is probably something like that.
[11:37:31] <ss_haze> filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha(Opacity=80);
[11:37:34] <ss_haze> wtf is this
[11:37:49] <webguy024> IE's opacity filter ss_haze
[11:38:01] <ss_haze> omg I don't even have windows
[11:38:02] <webguy024> thats ol'school
[11:38:05] <ss_haze> does it's
[11:38:09] <ss_haze> multiplatform
[11:39:19] <ss_haze> class="lightbox"
[11:39:26] <ss_haze> I have to do with div object?
[11:42:27] <RonWhoCares> I don't see why this form won't submit using jQuery.  Can someone identify what I am doing wrong?  http://jsfiddle.net/7VS9a/
[11:44:20] <Cork> RonWhoCares: if nothing else, your missing a form tag
[11:44:37] <shoky> RonWhoCares: you have an extra 'a'
[11:44:47] <shoky> RonWhoCares: line 6
[11:46:17] <shoky> heh
[11:47:25] <shoky> RonWhoCares: and it gives a weird error because you have an input with id="contact_email_address" which puts a global variable of that name
[11:47:28] <shoky> or someshit
[11:47:50] <shoky> instead of an undefined reference error like you'd expect
[11:48:29] <RonWhoCares> shoky: what am I suppose to do with it then?
[11:48:42] <shoky> RonWhoCares: delete the extra a on line 6
[11:48:50] <RonWhoCares> I did that
[11:48:59] <shoky> and?
[11:49:08] <Ungy> wow wth kind of train wreck am I looking at here
[11:51:20] <RonWhoCares> Still not working
[11:52:23] <Velveeta> without that a, that jsfiddle shows it working
[11:52:29] <Velveeta> except for the fact that the url is no good there
[11:52:44] <Velveeta> but the request data itself looks good
[11:53:55] <kegster> if i have content being pulled in via ajax, how do i get .accordion() to apply to an element after it's been ajaxed in? is there a listener i can use? im use to .on('action', 'trigger', function()}
[11:54:20] <Ungy> .on works if ther eis a change
[11:54:46] <Ungy> if you control the ajax call you can then trigger a change or load based off of a callback
[11:54:55] <joro> success:
[11:55:01] <RonWhoCares> Velveeta: Did you add "<form>" to it?
[11:55:37] <Velveeta> ronwhocares: no, in this particular instance, form is unnecessary because you're not submitting it anywhere, you're manually harvesting those input values and sending them in a $.post
[11:55:52] <Velveeta> it's still badly-formed markup, but it shouldn't break your js
[11:56:32] <RonWhoCares> I don't see the jQuery working on my screen with the 'a' removed
[11:57:01] <Velveeta> well unless you have a live example we can see in action, all i can say is that it's working on the jsfiddle page
[11:57:18] <Ungy> Velveeta badly formed html is still badly formed html even if your doing eveythign ajax
[11:57:19] <RonWhoCares> Velveeta: http://www.mypainmanagementtracker.net/useful-links/suggest-a-useful-link/
[11:57:19] <NaN> how can I acces to a var from my console if I'm wrapping all my code inside $(function{})
[11:57:43] <Ungy> NaN you have to expose it
[11:57:58] <NaN> Ungy: how?
[11:58:02] <Velveeta> nan: you'll have to set a breakpoint inside of that block somewhere and muck with it while it's in scope
[11:58:24] <Velveeta> otherwise, like ungy said, you'll have to expose it outside of that closure scope by making a window reference or something for it
[11:58:46] <Ungy> NaN well for debugging you could reemove the var and it puts it into global scpe but if you do that when your done debugging put it back
[11:58:48] <Velveeta> $(function () { var myPrivateVar = true; window.myExposedVar = myPrivateVar; });
[11:59:04] <ss_haze> those screen css and lightbox css concretely kills
[11:59:19] <ss_haze> how do I get those styles off
[12:00:42] <ss_haze> ./sass/lightbox.sass
[12:00:52] <kegster> ok so i can use success for ajax, but what about if i want to provide jquery code to the ajax call or somthing?
[12:00:54] <ss_haze> I use zurb foundation, why sass
[12:01:00] <kegster> im kinda buldng a mini framework
[12:01:32] <Ungy> kegster why?
[12:01:42] <NaN> what about doing a global var like >> var debug_vars = {} $(function() { debug_vars.foo = some_inside_var; })
[12:03:19] <Velveeta> ronwhocares: your document.ready function isn't firing for some reason
[12:03:28] <Velveeta> so it's never binding up your click listener
[12:04:04] <Velveeta> if i copy/paste that click function into my console and run it manually, then that button starts working, but at startup, my breakpoint isn't being triggered inside your document.ready
[12:04:30] <Velveeta> and it looks like that may be happening because you have another error in the page that's probably preventing it from continuing to load
[12:04:41] <Velveeta> Uncaught Error: The specified default tab ('li:first-child') could not be found in the tab set ('> ul > li') out of 0 tabs.
[12:05:45] <ss_haze> lightbox css made my syte ugly as f
[12:09:09] <peb7268> Hi all, I have a weird issue. Im rotating a div in chrome with jquery animate. It works the first time but the second time it doesnt rotate. Anyone know what my issue is? Maybe something with my step or some sort of cache? http://pastebin.com/KVbz5NF8
[12:09:55] <Cork> peb7268: why don't you just use transision?
[12:10:08] <peb7268> idk
[12:10:10] <Cork> transform have the same version dependency as transform
[12:10:13] <Cork> uh
[12:10:15] <peb7268> seemed like a good way to fo
[12:10:15] <peb7268> go
[12:10:22] <Cork> *transision has the same
[12:10:52] <peb7268> css transition or jquery transition?
[12:10:54] <Cork> peb7268: also you might want to use the prefixes too
[12:10:59] <Cork> peb7268: css
[12:11:04] <peb7268> yeah I was going to
[12:11:33] <peb7268> Just figured id do the chrome version first in testing
[12:12:46] <gumble> hey, what do I do if I want a my js to be able to be edited by others? I would need something like triggering a event and letting the triggered functions change some of my variables or so. e.g. I have a plugin which calculates prices. I need other plugins to be able to change the price before rendering. I would need var price = trigger-price-event-and-get-price. someone understands?
[12:12:52] <gumble> something like filters and action hooks in wordpress
[12:13:34] <Cork> gumble: have them send in the price, or offer a settings function
[12:14:16] <ihsw> hey, i'm getting "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'type' of null" on an $.ajax() call, can someone help me out
[12:14:22] <Cork> or take a callback and let them send in a function that does the calculations
[12:14:41] <Cork> ihsw: your code is needed
[12:14:42] <Cork> also
[12:14:44] <Cork> ?ask
[12:14:44] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:15:38] <RonWhoCares> I am sorry.  My computer froze after I put up the link to http://www.mypainmanagementtracker.net/useful-links/suggest-a-useful-link/
[12:15:39] <bowenac> having an issue with multiple datepickers
[12:15:45] <RonWhoCares> I missed the advice
[12:15:59] <bowenac> I can get the datepicker to show on each feild but the value always inserts into the first feild http://jsfiddle.net/Fa8Xx/974/
[12:16:48] <gumble> Cork: its more liks this. onKeyUp -> price is calculated -> just in case someone needs to change something, I have to set this $price = price-setted by others. what do you mean with send in?
[12:18:38] <ihsw> Cork: it's difficult to share it, but i've narrowed it down to the $.ajax() call, none of the callbacks get run
[12:19:42] <ihsw> well, i'm checking only success and error
[12:24:58] <bowenac> anyone have any ideas? I tried  $('.date').each(function(){       $(this).datepicker();       });
[12:26:46] <jaypitidi> If i want to pass an array into a function and I want that function to run for each item in the array, how do I reference the array items inside the function?
[12:28:33] <kegster> how can i listen for the window.innerHeight changing?
[12:30:23] <Cork> kegster: $(window),on('resize', function() {})
[12:31:54] <ph88_> jaypitidi: use a loop to iterate over the array ... it has nothing to do with passing an array into a function
[12:32:12] <ph88_> man i'm getting sleepy -___-
[12:32:25] <ph88_> "loop to iterate"  zzz
[12:49:09] <ss_haze> ok lightbox didn't work, as themes were broken, fancy box costs
[12:49:19] <ss_haze> now how do I do popup picture
[12:49:45] <ss_haze> why such basic things ask money, or frameworks
[12:50:17] <jedimind> ss_haze can you do it ?
[12:50:26] <jedimind> if its so basic and simple, write it yourself
[12:51:30] <ss_haze> I have never learned JS, and I don't like how this all web basic stuff can be sold for such money in 2013
[12:51:53] <ss_haze> alternative
[12:51:55] <ss_haze> please
[12:51:57] <ss_haze> then
[12:52:10] <ss_haze> you can't build computers without os now
[12:52:43] <ss_haze> there must be relatively opensource variants for such basic things as popup image
[12:54:13] <sekyms> Any one know of a image pre-loader that works in IE 7?
[12:54:26] <jedimind> ss_haze did you not google around for a lightbox / modal ?
[12:54:36] <jedimind> i mean there are literally a thousand of them at least
[12:55:15] <jedimind> ss_haze http://line25.com/articles/rounding-up-the-top-10-jquery-lightbox-scripts http://www.onextrapixel.com/2012/03/29/15-stunning-jquery-lightbox-plug-ins-for-your-upcoming-designs/ http://www.designyourway.net/blog/resources/30-efficient-jquery-lightbox-plugins/
[12:55:17] <jedimind> there's 55 of them
[12:55:20] <jedimind> in a 3 second google search
[12:55:27] <jedimind> have fun
[12:55:35] <ss_haze> first of all, I didn't had any idea modal is keyword
[12:55:51] <jedimind> ss_haze also your analogy for "cant have a computer without an os" is dumb because the OS costs money
[12:55:56] <sekyms> You know I was using ImagesLoaded jedimind but they seemed to have dropped support, so I was wondering if anyone had any recomendations
[12:56:15] <ss_haze> second, how do you think I start my ideas with, finding tech specs, or searching for simple solutions
[12:56:21] <jedimind> sekyms i havent supported ie7 in at least 3 years now, so i dont know what to recommend you
[12:56:49] <sekyms> cool story, question probably wasn't for yu then
[12:57:02] <jedimind> sekyms ... you asked me specifically
[12:57:05] <jedimind> i wanst talking to you
[12:58:31] <sekyms> probably a misunderstanding
[12:58:36] * jedimind hugs sekyms 
[12:58:40] <sekyms> maybe you werent telling me to google
[12:58:46] <jedimind> no i wasnt
[12:58:48] <jedimind> i was talking to ss_haze
[12:59:04] <sekyms> I see
[12:59:09] <sekyms> hence the confusion
[12:59:17] <sekyms> i think this is how World War I started
[12:59:22] <sekyms> on IRC
[12:59:31] <ss_haze> all those modals take there own stupid posibilities of jquery versions doubling, and stuff not working
[12:59:43] <ss_haze> it's 5 plugin I try right now
[13:00:41] <ss_haze> so modals something you can start pricing
[13:01:03] <ss_haze> cause your more than 1000 lines code do one stupid job
[13:01:11] <ph88_> what's a modal ?
[13:01:23] <jedimind> ss_haze what is your point? why are you still talking ?
[13:01:33] <jedimind> literally several million sites in the world have lightboxes and modals
[13:01:38] <jedimind> they figured it out, so can you.
[13:01:52] <ss_haze> my point is who own computers programming languages and functionality like modals
[13:02:02] <ss_haze> I did not even knew the world
[13:02:02] <ph88_> modals ??
[13:02:06] <ss_haze> word **
[13:02:17] <ss_haze> popup images and boxes
[13:02:18] <amph1bius> hahaha
[13:02:21] <ss_haze> lol
[13:02:28] <amph1bius> are you going to patent it ?
[13:02:34] <jedimind> modal is an existing word
[13:02:43] <jedimind> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window
[13:04:00] <ss_haze> but for pics it should be default html reaction
[13:04:14] <ph88_> what are good alternatives to modal windows ?
[13:04:53] <ss_haze> how much time it takes to try 5 and none working
[13:05:17] <ss_haze> guys who wanted to sell such functionality can go sink in river
[13:07:31] <Velveeta> "sekyms: i think this is how World War I started" <-- lulz
[13:07:35] <ss_haze> I mean really, next great plan would be selling windows with only one start button, asking for 10 dollars, just because it's functionality
[13:08:47] <Velveeta> umâ€¦.. windows *does* only have 1 start button..
[13:09:22] <Velveeta> i love this mentality about "why should i have to pay for X?! it's such a simple thing, it's just X!" "then write it yourself" "i can't!"
[13:09:30] <ss_haze> web is for connecting people, bring bussiness alive and sharing real things, not selling modal popups
[13:09:33] <ss_haze> for domains
[13:09:35] <Velveeta> why should i have to buy a car, all it does is drive me from point A to point B
[13:09:38] <ss_haze> f them
[13:10:34] <Velveeta> how can a place charge money for a door? it's such a simple thing, you have to have a way to get in and out of a building/room, who owns doors?
[13:12:14] <ss_haze> web is not a place like physical house, you own only intelectual property that doesn't inflict other rights, and trying to sell something like window opener is bad idea
[13:13:00] <ss_haze> one day large corporations will track anythin,.. oh well
[13:13:05] <ss_haze> whatever
[13:15:01] <ss_haze> you can't write, cause you weren't the one who created dominant programming language
[13:15:05] <Velveeta> well, if people take the time to solve a problem, and they decide that solution may be worth money to other people, they have every right to sell their solution
[13:15:22] <Velveeta> the programming language isn't what they're selling, they're selling the solution created in that language
[13:15:38] <Velveeta> they're selling their specific implementation
[13:15:48] <Velveeta> whether it's for physical or virtual goods doesn't matter
[13:16:11] <ss_haze> but the language itself is a problem, cause it's created by same people who want to sell you product, you cannot implement in this situation other ways
[13:16:56] <Velveeta> nobody charges for using the javascript language
[13:17:02] <Velveeta> so the language itself is not a problem
[13:17:17] <ss_haze> at first doesn't everything comes from machine code, so how can translating such thing, and creating it difficult as functionality can be a good thing
[13:18:00] <ss_haze> it's illogical by the way such standartised products should be
[13:18:17] <Velveeta> i have no clue what you're even arguing about anymore
[13:18:24] <ss_haze> yeah maybe
[13:18:25] <Velveeta> you're making points that have no basis in actual reality
[13:20:01] <jedimind> can we stop feeding the troll at this point ?
[13:20:18] <BillCriswell> damn i missed a troll feeding
[13:20:44] <Velveeta> i should have charged him for my time, so he could bitch about how nobody owns time and how can i charge money for such a thing
[13:21:28] <ss_haze> If I would draw my websyte on paper, does that would be different from damn computer, then why make it harder by making modals sellable
[13:21:34] <ss_haze> that was the all point
[13:22:12] <Velveeta> of course it's different, you need skilled labor to implement it on a computer.. any idiot can scrawl on a piece of paper
[13:22:36] <jedimind> and for the record, browser DO have modal windows built in
[13:22:38] <jedimind> its called alert()
[13:23:05] <Velveeta> just suck it up, nancy, and buy a solution or pay someone to roll a custom one for you, or else put in some time and learn javascript so you can write your own for free
[13:23:23] <jedimind> or learn enough about javascript to know which one of the free ones to use
[13:23:23] <jedimind> and how
[13:23:28] <ss_haze> lets call major population idiots who whouldn't be able to understand how these all bloodsucking dirty products are not even needed for most of them
[13:23:48] <jedimind> ok im officially done with this moron
[13:23:50] <ss_haze> yeah, I should try
[13:23:51] <jedimind> lets move on
[13:24:08] <Velveeta> indeed
[13:25:25] <ss_haze> move on to next version, when there is left only big web corporations and you all are left for bs about tech that should make people lifes better
[13:25:44] <ss_haze> ok this one was too harsh
[13:26:11] <kegster> is there a way to listen for ANY ajax call COMPLETION?
[13:26:14] <Velveeta> i don't even know how to read your words anymore
[13:26:26] <ss_haze> too much Velveeta
[13:26:26] <ss_haze> ?
[13:26:39] <Cork> ?api ajacComplete
[13:26:39] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.

[13:27:16] <Velveeta> ss_haze: no, your broken english coupled with whatever blind rage is preventing you from string a coherent sentence together
[13:27:21] <PuffTheMagic> does anyone know how I can reset the css of a slider that has been disable so that it looks like default
[13:27:27] <Velveeta> stringing*
[13:27:48] <ss_haze> yeah, I kinda troll out a bit
[13:28:00] <Velveeta> puffthemagic: you want to make it appear enabled when it's in a disabled state? am i reading that properly?
[13:28:04] <ss_haze> coherent, such a high level english
[13:30:51] <al1o_> good evening
[13:31:19] <al1o_> is there a way to "debug" jQuery, considering performance?
[13:32:06] <al1o_> I'm updating a table though a socket.io connection while having HTML5 Audio stream at the same time
[13:32:41] <al1o_> whenever the DOM is modified by jquery I get short, but annoying "pops" in the Audio
[13:33:45] <Velveeta> have you done any performance testing on it to see if it's hogging memory/cpu during those popping cycles?
[13:33:53] <NoiseEee> al1o_: my guess would be you'd be getting pops when modifying the DOM even without jquery
[13:34:08] <NoiseEee> al1o_: but general debug guide is http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[13:35:33] <al1o_> I don't blaim jquery - it's more that I want to find and eliminate unnecessary DOM operations
[13:35:57] <Velveeta> it'll be nice when jquery starts binding dom manipulations to animation frames
[13:36:19] <Velveeta> i'm just starting to refactor our ui widgets to respect animation frame timing for all option updates that get reflected by dom operations
[13:36:23] <al1o_> this is the site: dxheat.com/dxc
[13:36:41] <al1o_> click on any frequency and the audio will open
[13:37:17] <al1o_> tnx for the link - I'll read it
[13:48:50] <PuffTheMagic> Velveeta, correct
[13:48:56] <PuffTheMagic> sorry about the delay there
[13:50:02] <Velveeta> puffthemagic: you can override the css with specificity to get rid of the look of the disabled state
[13:53:33] <PuffTheMagic> not sure how I would go about that
[13:54:08] <PuffTheMagic> my css is rusty its been a few years since i've done this
[13:54:22] <Velveeta> you'll have to find the class(es) in the css that set the appearance of the disabled state, and write a nearly-duplicate-selector with slightly more specificity, like prepend it with body or something
[13:54:47] <Velveeta> if the rule is e.g. .ui-state-disabled.slider { }, make your rule: body .ui-state-disabled.slider { }
[13:55:12] <Velveeta> and set the properties back that it's trying to set to make it appear disabled
[14:23:41] <ahhughes> I know this is pretty simple, but what could I use to create a 100% WxH overlay/pane like you get here (with all the step 1, 2... on it) http://apps.harvestchoice.org/mappr/
[14:24:06] <ahhughes> basically a model dialog, without the dialog itself.
[14:24:56] <grafi> ahhughes just some css ;)
[14:25:14] <ahhughes> I figured as much.
[14:25:21] <tgodar> ahhughes: and a div
[14:25:40] <tgodar> maybe goolge words 'div overlay'
[14:26:48] <tgodar> you know you could copy the exact implementation they did looking at that sites source yes?  <div id="loadingAppDiv"></div> ... and its styles

[15:21:52] <petey> Can anyone throw me a bone as to what I should google to figure that out?
[15:22:37] <shoky> petey: "after everything is loaded" ?  maybe you want $(window).load(..)

[15:31:07] <__equinox> ok
[15:31:12] <__equinox> one other question
[15:31:26] <__equinox> how do I check if $(this) has the class of 'like' or 'dislike'
[15:31:36] <shoky> .hasClass
[15:31:53] <shoky> or .is
[15:35:45] <ahhughes> another noob question sorry, but I need to grab http://some3rdpartyserver.com/data.json in my app, what's the best way todo this with jquery?
[15:37:05] <ahhughes> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/ ?
[15:40:56] <astropirate> Hello friends
[15:41:02] <astropirate> I set data attribute for a node
[15:41:02] <shoky> ahhughes: the server has to be configured to allow ajax connections. either with CORS or JSONP
[15:41:08] <astropirate> when i getback it changes my string to number
[15:41:11] <astropirate> why
[15:41:21] <astropirate> it is a hexadecimal value but a string
[15:41:21] <shoky> astropirate: using .data() ?
[15:41:30] <astropirate> if it has e, it thinks its in e notation
[15:41:32] <astropirate> shoky, yes
[15:41:50] <shoky> astropirate: yes, read the .data() docs, it does that
[15:41:52] <astropirate> but if i do attr('data-fooooo')  it will give me string
[15:41:54] <ahhughes> shoky: "the server" is the one @ http://some3rdpartyserver.com ?
[15:41:55] <astropirate> yes
[15:42:00] <astropirate> shoky, yes i know it does that. why
[15:42:16] <EGreg> data stores a string
[15:42:16] <astropirate> why convert hexadecimal to base 10
[15:43:21] <astropirate> EGreg, it stores string too, but if my  hex string has  forexample:  d32f32432e231a23   it will make ti  165465e231
[15:43:28] <astropirate> and return as number
[15:43:31] <astropirate> i loose chars
[15:44:23] <shoky> astropirate: i donno the exact reasoning behind it.. but if you want to make sure it's a string you have to use .attr
[15:44:43] <astropirate> yah i was thinking that too
[15:45:02] <astropirate> but i want to store  an object with valus that are string representations of hex values
[15:45:19] <astropirate> I think i wuold have to make in into JSON and store
[15:45:22] <astropirate> and then parse it back
[15:45:25] <astropirate> this is very bad
[15:45:34] <shoky> you want to store it wher
[15:45:35] <shoky> where?
[15:45:52] <astropirate> in the node's data attribute
[15:45:55] <shoky> why?
[15:46:14] <astropirate> because front end developement sucks and i have no other way to get data back from dialog box
[15:46:29] <astropirate> the other way is sphegetti code
[15:46:30] <shoky> well you can still use .data to write (and then read back)
[15:46:34] <shoky> and you'll get whatever you wrote
[15:46:44] <astropirate> right
[15:46:53] <astropirate> but i am afraid it is goingto screw up my hex values
[15:47:04] <shoky> if you write it with .data() then it won't screw up anything
[15:47:22] <astropirate> shoky, if i write in data  it doesnt
[15:47:24] <shoky> it can only screw that up when reading from the data-xxx attribute, the first time you call .data() to read from the element
[15:47:26] <astropirate> but if read it with .data() it will
[15:47:46] <astropirate> surprisingly that is the only way i got it to work
[15:47:49] <astropirate> reading it as an attribute
[15:47:55] <shoky> astropirate: the first hex value that you put in your data-xxx , you'll have to read with .attr
[15:48:00] <astropirate> .attr('data-foo')   ==== valid hex string
[15:48:04] <shoky> you can write it back straight away with .data if you want
[15:48:14] <shoky> (which doesn't write to the actual data-xx attribute)
[15:48:18] <shoky> it's just in memory
[15:48:33] <astropirate> isn't all of DOM in memory?
[15:48:38] <astropirate> real question
[15:49:01] <ahhughes> is it valid to think I can load http://some3rdpartyserver.com/data.json  with jsonp (no server side code required)?
[15:49:47] <shoky> astropirate: well yes but it's still more costly to encode the string and write it into a DOM node's attribute
[15:50:14] <shoky> astropirate: much more costly than just storing with .data()  which doesn't encode anything and just stores in javascript memory like any variable
[15:50:31] <astropirate> shoky, you know what i'm going to do. I'm going to put a function reference in a data attribute   and that way every dialog can have own logic do its stuff, andjust pass the data to the callback
[15:50:40] <astropirate> instead of putting it into the node
[15:50:55] <ahhughes> well, here some real json I want to load into my app.... http://www.bom.gov.au/fwo/IDS60801/IDS60801.94808.json
[15:51:39] <astropirate> shoky,  thank you!
[15:51:59] <shoky> ahhughes:  the server has to be configured to respond to jsonp requests
[15:52:31] <shoky> ahhughes: this one doesn't seem to be.
[15:52:42] <ahhughes> shoky: can I test that somehow? I think its unlikely.
[15:53:43] <shoky> ahhughes: you add a "callback" parameter to the URL like:  http://www.bom.gov.au/fwo/IDS60801/IDS60801.94808.json?callback=bla
[15:54:12] <shoky> if it was responding with a JSONP response, you'd see a "bla" function call wrapping the JSON object
[15:54:22] <shoky> like:   bla({ .... })
[15:55:05] <ahhughes> right, and that returns the json wrapped in javascriupt, thats loaded, and uses the callback to pass data back to the app?
[15:55:26] <shoky> ahhughes: yeap
[15:55:56] <ahhughes> cool, but they obviously don't support it so my only option is to go server side right?
[15:56:06] <shoky> seems like it yeah
[15:56:08] <ahhughes> i.e. a proxy
[15:56:30] <shoky> unless they have their own specific way to do JSONP thats maybe documented somewhere.. adunno
[16:03:23] <clh> hi folks, what are folks using for mobile app form validation?  validatr?  "jQuery Validation"?
[16:34:21] <sententia> Hey everyone, I have a question, I'm using Ajax to load my pages, however when I navigate back to the index page, which is called "login-page" it loads it twice. I've figured out what is happening it is thinking the first page is an external and loading it again. My question is how do I navigate back to the page without making it external. I'm using $.mobile.changePage(app.registry.origin + "/index.html", {showLoadMsg: false});
[16:36:21] <sententia> I've looked at the dom and you can see the second page being loaded in. However the data-url is index.html where the first page is data-url="login-page"
[16:41:35] <sententia> No worries, the room is not that active right now I'll keep on looking on how to solve it.
[16:54:21] <vinex08> to learn jquery, do i have to learn JS first?
[16:54:33] <grafi> not really
[16:54:56] <grafi> although of course js is involved to use jquery :)
[16:57:57] <shoky> it's recommended to learn JS first, vinex08

[17:14:10] <grafi> jquery is a library written in javascript
[17:20:40] <vinex08> hmmm.. what's this. if you know css . you'll easy learn jquery
[17:20:43] <vinex08> true?
[17:21:14] <tw2113> jquery selectors can be specified in the same style as css selectors
[17:21:19] <tw2113> #id, .class, etc

[17:26:18] <Sal> hi, i need to display a div under a table row when clicked. Do you think its better to create the div every time the user clicks on a row or should i create one at the bottom of the page and clone it when needed?
[17:26:19] <grafi> awesome
[17:26:20] <grafi> :D
[17:26:28] <Sal> or are there better ways?
[17:27:38] <BillCriswell> Sal: So like... <table><tr><td>Whatver</td></tr><div>More</div></table>? That might cause some issues.
[17:27:49] <grafi> "might"
[17:27:50] <grafi> xD
[17:28:22] <Sal> no, i first create another <tr> under then one just clicked with 1 <td colspan>
[17:28:36] <BillCriswell> Sal: Ah, got it.
[17:28:45] <grafi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-bIhCBSrzU BillCriswell :D

[17:28:57] <BillCriswell> Brown Bear
[17:29:15] <grafi> :]
[17:29:29] <Sal> so i was wondering what could be the best way to show up this panel?
[17:29:45] <Sal> create a dynamic panel on every click?
[17:30:04] <Sal> create the panel hidden at the bottom of the page and then clone it?
[17:30:13] <BillCriswell> Sal: Hmmm... It's a lot of DOM manipulation. You might be able to create it and move it to where it's needed? Not sure which would be "best" though.
[17:38:44] <BillCriswell> Sal: http://jsbin.com/oWEpopig/1/edit?html,js,output might help?
[17:38:48] <BillCriswell> Ah crap he left.
[17:39:11] <grafi> too little too late :D
[17:39:30] <BillCriswell> That's what I get for tring to help.

[17:43:04] <ahhughes> this worked just before, I have made a typo or I am doing somthing fundementally wrong :(
[17:43:19] <BillCriswell> Is the XML valid?
[17:43:41] <ahhughes> well given it worked once before I ASSume so :/
[17:45:15] <shoky> console.log(data)
[17:45:24] <grafi> ass
[17:45:26] <grafi> lol
[17:51:07] <ahhughes> the xml's valid :(
[17:52:29] <BillCriswell> ahhughes: What aout what shoky said.
[17:53:11] <ahhughes> I think its already parsed because of the dataType the server responds with... just a theory at this stage. back later to find out.
[17:54:16] <shoky> ahhughes: yes if the server replies with xml mimetype then jquery automatically parses it for you (unless you specify a dataType)
[17:54:30] <ahhughes> solved!
[17:54:37] <ahhughes> thanks again!

[18:36:23] <freebirD2> tks man
[18:37:04] <freebirD2> now, it's not linkable anymore, but is there a way I can make it with that look that it's not clicable ?? because it looks the same, but the button is not a link anyhmore
[18:37:20] <freebirD2> but how do I make it look like when it's disabled ?
[18:37:38] <grafi> oO
[18:37:41] <tw2113> add an underline text decoration?
[18:37:41] <grafi> Oo
[18:37:44] <grafi> oO
[18:37:45] <grafi> Oo
[18:37:46] <grafi> oO
[18:37:48] <grafi> Oo
[18:38:01] <grafi> you can dance if you want to
[18:38:07] <grafi> you can leave your friends behind
[18:38:25] <tw2113> very nice impression of The Rock, grafi
[18:38:35] <grafi> do you SMELL
[18:38:36] <freebirD2> tw2113, underline ?
[18:38:42] <grafi> what the rooooooooock is cooking?
[18:38:45] <grafi> man
[18:38:48] <freebirD2> no, like when I set disable, in html, something like that
[18:39:02] <grafi> so do it
[18:39:03] <grafi> oÃ´
[18:39:22] <tw2113> freebirD2, i have no idea what you want any more
[18:39:24] <pixelpimp> ha.  it's so sad I can actually see oO as the rock
[18:39:28] <tw2113> you want it not actually linking, but looking like a link?
[18:39:50] <freebirD2> when the button get lighter
[18:39:54] <freebirD2> gets
[18:40:01] <pixelpimp> freebirD2: whatever it is, it comes down to CSS.  Do you have a link to what you're talking about?
[18:40:03] <freebirD2> so you look, and you know it's not clicable
[18:40:37] <tw2113> wouldn't that be regular text?
[18:40:42] <grafi> dont make it a fucking link?
[18:40:43] <grafi> oÃ´
[18:43:32] <freebirD2> grafi, don't be neurotic, there you go
[18:43:34] <freebirD2> 	<script>
[18:43:34] <freebirD2> 		$('#comInserir').removeAttr('href');
[18:43:34] <freebirD2> 		$('#comInserir').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
[18:43:34] <freebirD2> 	</script>
[18:43:39] <freebirD2> done
[18:43:57] <tw2113> removing the href makes it not clickable already
[18:44:02] <tw2113> at least in the jsbin i made
[18:44:11] <grafi> and now its still a link thats very much broken
[18:44:12] <grafi> :D
[18:46:36] <pixelpimp> why disable what I assume is an <a>?
[18:47:58] <freebirD2> because it looks nicer, and the <a is a button
[18:48:04] <Tingle> I got a weird issue, Im doing .removeClass(), but it isnt removing the class from the dom object, but if I call hasClass after I use removeClass() is says false.
[18:48:07] <tw2113> why not use <button> ?
[18:48:19] <chilversc> freebirD2: odd, many browsers stop treating it like a link at all once the href is gone (eg, stops showing a pointer, etc)
[18:48:35] <grafi> Tingle looking at the source wont show the current markup but the one you started with
[18:48:53] <Tingle> I know
[18:49:06] <Tingle> but the effect of the class is still in my browser
[18:49:28] <Tingle> and its still in inspector
[18:49:46] <grafi> have it online somewhere?
[18:49:49] <freebirD2> chilversc, how do I set href to #, intead of removing it ?
[18:49:52] <Tingle> no
[18:49:54] <freebirD2> 		$('#comInserir').removeAttr('href');
[18:50:41] <grafi> hm
[18:50:51] <grafi> no idea whats going on Tingle :D
[18:51:04] <Tingle> basicly I do: hasClass() returns true, removeClass(), hasClass() returns false. DOM object still has the class on it
[18:51:05] <chilversc> freebirD2: I think those browser oddities can be overcome with correct css styling
[18:51:05] <chilversc> and its normally only a problem when you do not have a href but do want it clickable (eg emulating a button)
[18:51:11] <pixelpimp> freebirD2: "the <a> is a button" is semantically invalid
[18:51:24] <pixelpimp> the <a> is a link. a <button> is a button.
[18:51:36] <freebirD2> looks good
[18:51:37] <freebirD2> 		$('#comInserir').attr('href', '#');
[18:51:42] <freebirD2> what do you guys think ?
[18:51:54] <chilversc> pixelpimp: yeah, though I've come across issues when I want something that the user conceptually thinks of as a link but from the application's its a button
[18:52:25] <pixelpimp> Have an example?
[18:52:28] <chilversc> pixelpimp: as buttons do not have quite the same behaviour as a link (for focus) so their interaction always seems a little odd
[18:52:30] <grafi> Tingle do you use removeClass('.class') ?
[18:52:35] <Tingle> no
[18:52:46] <chilversc> pixelpimp: eg, using a tabbed area, but the panel switching is handled by javascript
[18:53:01] <Tingle> sec I think I created a bug
[18:53:05] <chilversc> pixelpimp: the user sees it as a sort of navigation so expects something similar to a link for each of the tab buttons
[18:53:31] <chilversc> pixelpimp: but the actual interaction in terms of the application is a button (since it isn't linking to anything, its reacting to the click event to change tab)
[18:54:32] <pixelpimp> so why is that not a button with styling?
[18:55:22] <chilversc> pixelpimp: the focus comes out a little bit wrong, links don't retain focus, so I'm thinking I need a little shim to remove focus from the button if the user clicks on it with the mouse
[18:55:39] <chilversc> but I havn't had time to play with the focus to emulate links correctly
[18:59:54] <pixelpimp> $('button').focus(function() { this.blur(); }); perhaps
[19:00:25] <pixelpimp> http://middle-earth.thehobbit.com/ <- this is awesome
[19:00:56] <chilversc> pixelpimp: I'm thinking it needs to be on mouseup, but have to create a test case and try it out in the main browsers
[19:01:12] <chilversc> pixelpimp: as chrome retains focus when using keyboard interaction
[19:01:45] <pixelpimp> I don't think it should matter, that code should take care of it
[19:02:13] <BillCriswell> pixelpimp: I have no idea what's going on ahah.
[19:02:21] <chilversc> pixelpimp: that would remove the focus even when trying to use the keyboard, which would break tabbing
[19:03:06] <pixelpimp> which is what I thought you intended to do
[19:04:19] <pixelpimp> mouseup might not necessarily fire on it when the mouse button is released
[19:04:31] <pixelpimp> click, drag a little, release
[19:07:43] <chilversc> yup, that and clicking on a link seems to move the focus position, but without actually focusing the element
[19:07:55] <chilversc> pixelpimp: its hard to emulate the focus behaviour of a link correctly
[19:29:11] <peepsalot> is $("blah", jqueryObject) the same as jqueryObject.find("blah")?
[19:31:26] <pixelpimp> yes
[19:32:00] <pixelpimp> as far as I know, they're identical, at least
[19:32:24] <ahhughes> I have... $xml = $( xmlData );      This works... $xml.find("area[aac='asdf'']").attr("description"); //works....    but $.each( $xml.find("area"), function( key, $area) { $area.attr("description"); });   says Object #<Element> has no method 'attr'
[19:33:41] <pixelpimp> probably $($area)
[19:34:14] <pixelpimp> I think you're getting the element back, not the jQuery object
[19:39:27] <ahhughes> TypeError: Object #<Element> has no method 'attr'  ?
[19:39:58] <pixelpimp> what of it?
[19:40:44] <ahhughes> Bingo! you're right pixelpimp
[19:52:58] <peepsalot> i have a page with images, and i want to select all images that are not in a div of a certain class type.  how would i go about that?
[19:57:39] <grafi> $('img').filter(function() { return $(this).parent().is(':not(.class)'); }) or somesuch thing
[19:58:09] <pixelpimp> oh my
[19:58:25] <pixelpimp> $('div:not(.badClass) img')
[19:58:55] <grafi> i find that solution to be much too elegant pixelpimp
[19:59:57] <pixelpimp> :)
[20:05:05] <grafi> and apparently my version is only 92% slower
[20:05:07] <grafi> hahaha
[20:05:08] <grafi> :D
[20:59:02] <peepsalot> why doesn't this example remove the div? http://jsfiddle.net/E3MQ2/
[21:02:36] <peepsalot> figured it out, i have to do this instead x.find(".removeme").remove();
[21:11:02] <ahhughes> how am I supposed to get "Friday" e.t.c. from  new Date().?????;
[21:12:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: you around
[21:16:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay any one know how i can detech a swipe on an input
[21:16:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> *detect
[21:17:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> i remember something about touches[0]
[21:17:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> or something like that
[21:29:44] <VisualCSharp> Hey folks. I use the popular File Upload component by BlueImp. Today I ran into an issue with IE 11 running in IE 9 document mode. BlueImp's iframe-transport script uses jQuery's append function to move a hidden input type="file" control from the real form to a hidden form. The hidden form contains an iframe that the hidden form's target points to.
[21:30:09] <VisualCSharp> I and others have noticed that IE 9 seems to no longer submit the contents of the input type="file" control when it is appended in this way.
[21:30:44] <VisualCSharp> I wanted to check to see if anyone here has noticed this issue. BlueImp's own demo at http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/basic.html is broken with this same issue.
[21:31:56] <VisualCSharp> I have also documented my findings extensively here: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/issues/2655
[21:31:56] <b-ot> VisualCSharp: Issue #2655 by Celludriel (1mon 1w ago): IE 9: first upload does not send file
[21:33:06] <peepsalot> ok, why do neither of these tests select "test3" http://jsfiddle.net/E3MQ2/2/
[21:33:30] <peepsalot> i want to select elements where title is set to something other than empty string
[21:36:11] <VisualCSharp> x.find('a[title][title!=""]')
[21:36:31] <VisualCSharp> There might be a better way. :)
[21:37:45] <peepsalot> VisualCSharp, thanks, i still don't understand why but that works
[21:44:55] <VisualCSharp> peepsalot, it's filtering by attribute twice.
[21:45:08] <VisualCSharp> The first makes sure there *is* a title attribute, the second makes sure it's not empty.
[21:45:11] <peepsalot> i mean why wouldn't my example select test3 though?
[21:45:27] <peepsalot> :(
[21:47:54] <Whirl3d> When loading content via jquery ajax using .load(contenturl, optsarg); if contenturl is an html or php  page that has header elements, when the loaded doc is added to the dom, is the <head> content just ignored?
[22:06:02] <raj> if I use the `data` property of an ajax GET request, it overwrites the URL's query string?
[22:21:11] <kegster> how can i have the accordion adjust the height of the parent div?
[22:28:47] <moodawg> #gruntjs
[22:33:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> any familiar with hammer js or with touch events
[22:34:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> i need to be able to capture drag
[22:39:10] <Tingle> can someone show me what the regex expression would be to select [ and ] characters?
[22:52:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyone know how to deteck swipe on like an input
[23:14:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyone familar with hammer js
[23:15:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> or how to detect touch drag
[23:49:56] <[E]sc> i want to use html5 to validate the user input email address before sending it to the server via ajax, is that possible? currently i've set the submit to event.preventDefault() which stops the html5 validation, but allows for my jquery script to work.
[23:50:45] <Cork> [E]sc: where are you running reventDefault?
[23:53:31] <Cork> [E]sc?
[23:54:24] <[E]sc> Cork, i'm currently running it after the user hits submits, which i know is probably the wrong place to put it for what i want.  the pastebin: http://pastebin.com/K3icHXyZ
[23:54:45] <[E]sc> sorry, connection to pastebin was slow
[23:54:57] <Cork> [E]sc: bind submit on the form instead of click on a button
[23:55:00] <Cork> and it should work
[23:55:19] <Cork> also you don't define event
[23:55:27] <Cork> function() => function(event)
[23:55:44] <[E]sc> Cork, thanks. i'll try that out. and i'll fix that
[23:55:50] <Cork> and finally you don't need to escape [] if you quote the value
[23:56:03] <Cork> $("input[name='email\\[\\]']") => $("input[name='email[]']")
[23:56:46] <[E]sc> ahh... thanks so much Cork.
[23:56:51] <Cork> np
[23:56:55] <raj> why is $.ajax not sending the query string in the GET request?
[23:57:09] <Cork> raj: what?
[23:57:21] <raj> oh, sorry
[23:57:31] <raj> nevermind, I wasn't thinking
[23:58:16] <kpl> Currently jQuery UI does not include styling of traditional check/radio-buttons (although I understand that there are plans to support this, like mobile does). I need some larger check boxes, and some that appear the same on different browsers, and preferably some which are compatible with jQuery UI themes. Any plugin suggestions?
