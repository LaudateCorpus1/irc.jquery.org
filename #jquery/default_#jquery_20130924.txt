[06:36:32] <frothnicator> Wolf_22: it looks like you've copied and pasted some text.  You'll have more success with folks on this channel if you provide a minimal _working_ example of your problem in something like JSFiddle.
[06:37:37] <frothnicator> Wolf_22: that means all three of HTML, CSS, and JS such that folks can click 'Run' and see the problem.  jsbin is another option.
[07:15:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> hey guys is there any way by which i can grab a cell value (from a <table>) using array like notation something along the lines of  $("table")[1][1] <-- which selects the first column first row cell
[07:16:10] <jedimind> Rohan_Bhangui nth-child
[07:16:26] <jedimind> table tr:nth-child(3) td:nth-child(2) { … }
[07:16:40] <jedimind> that's a css selector basically
[07:17:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay so soemthing like
[07:18:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> $("table tr:nth-child(3) td:nth-child(2)").{...};
[07:18:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> right?
[07:19:12] <Syrit> Cork, do you have a sec please ?
[07:19:59] <BillCriswell> Rohan_Bhangui: It might be a little easier to sneak in there with $('table tr').eq( rowNumber ).find('td').eq( columnNumber );
[07:20:10] <BillCriswell> That way you don't need to concatenate all this shit.
[07:20:49] <BillCriswell> all that shit*
[07:20:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> alright ill try it
[07:21:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> but what i wrote should work too right?
[07:21:08] <BillCriswell> You can replace "shit" with a better noun as well I'm sure.
[07:21:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> just for reference
[07:21:18] <BillCriswell> Rohan_Bhangui: Yes.
[07:21:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[07:22:38] <BillCriswell> $('table tr').eq( rowNumber ).find('td').eq( columnNumber ) vs $('table tr:nth-child(' + rowNumber + ') td:nth-child(' + columnNumber + ')') though.
[07:22:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol yes i see
[07:22:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> thanks
[07:23:05] <mw44118> Anyone in here understand how to use context with $.ajax?  I tried to do context: {'boom':99}, and I hoped that a var named "boom" would be visible in my success callback, but no!  So I clearly don't understand.
[07:23:05] <BillCriswell> Yeahyee.
[07:23:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> and if i want to set the value
[07:23:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> i would use the name
[07:23:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> *same
[07:23:52] <BillCriswell> Rohan_Bhangui: Yes.
[07:24:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[07:24:13] <BillCriswell> Half a dozen to one, six to the other.
[07:24:21] <BillCriswell> I always mess that phrase up.
[07:44:25] <grafi> BillCriswell you old macbook user
[07:45:00] <BillCriswell> Macbook Air.
[07:45:07] <Syrit> guys, i am using jquery UI (datePicker what concerns me), i am cloning a field set, one of the input has a "hasDatepicker" class, the cloned one does have it too, but the problem is, when i click on the cloned input, the calendar shows up on the original (parent) field, how can i solve that ?
[07:45:56] <grafi> naughty question
[07:46:02] <Syrit> ?
[07:46:16] <Syrit> what do you mean grafi
[07:46:17] <grafi> do i have to pay for office etc on a mac, or are there ways around that
[07:46:23] <grafi> talking to BillCriswell
[07:46:28] <grafi> Syrit ^
[07:46:39] <Syrit> oh sorry , thought you were talking to me grafi
[07:46:43] <mvpgraff> why not pay for it?
[07:46:43] <mvpgraff> ;o
[07:46:44] <BillCriswell> grafi: I have a 2011 Air.
[07:46:48] <BillCriswell> Also an old pro haha
[07:48:17] <Coenego> Hi! How can you determine if the browser is IE9 using jquery.support?
[07:49:58] <anli_> Seems like firefox error console has being "improved" and rendered useless by now
[07:52:04] <dcherman> Coenego: you don't - browser sniffing is generally bad, you should use feature detection where possible.  what is special about IE9 in your case?
[07:52:59] <Coenego> issue with jquery.fileupload when pressing enter button on the input element, the form gets submitted instead of opening a file selector
[07:53:04] <Coenego> only happens in IE9
[07:55:28] <maxmoore14> this seems kinda basic, but anyone know how I can detect IE less than 10 and show browsehappy link?
[07:55:42] <maxmoore14> I feel like I should be able to use <!--[if lt IE 10]>
[07:56:11] <maxmoore14> but I'm using jquery mobile and formatting seems to be an issue
[07:56:38] <maxmoore14> could be that I'm just not putting it in the right place...
[08:04:08] <Syrit> guys, i want to apply some action on a div children only if the type is Input, but i coudln't figure out how to test if the type is input or not, any tips ?
[08:07:59] <jp-> Syrit, http://jsfiddle.net/jptrosclair/jAb2b/
[08:09:12] <Syrit> hmmm , actually i was thinking of something like this : if($(this).type === 'select'){ alert('OMG');
[08:09:12] <Syrit> }
[08:09:17] <Syrit> jp-,
[08:12:05] <Syrit> here the code , and here is why i would preffer if statement jp- ,i don't know if your way could work with my code ?
[08:12:06] <Syrit> http://jsfiddle.net/jptrosclair/jAb2b/
[08:12:26] <jp-> you need to update it
[08:12:35] <jp-> that's the same post i just gave you
[08:14:00] <Syrit> oh
[08:14:31] <Syrit> here it is jp-  , sorry , http://jsfiddle.net/jAb2b/7/
[08:14:45] <jp-> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.type/
[08:16:57] <Syrit> oh, so its the right way to go, but seems that i am using it wrong way, thank you jp-
[08:17:39] <Cpudan80> Hello folks
[08:17:50] <Cpudan80> Is there any JQuery UI dialog that can replace a confirm dialog?
[08:18:15] <Cpudan80> Note that a confirm dialog offers synchronous behavior ... dont see any jquery dialogs that will do that
[08:19:44] <jp-> sorry, type() is not what you want, you need to get the dom element and look at nodeValue.
[08:20:29] <Syrit> i tried type like so, but it did not work http://jsfiddle.net/jAb2b/13/
[08:22:40] <Syrit> is there any specific method i should conceder using jp-  ?
[08:24:15] <jp-> http://jsfiddle.net/jAb2b/21/
[08:25:02] <Syrit> i think i can go this way, with is ! if $(this).is('input' ) ! jp-  !
[08:25:36] <jp-> looks like you can use jquery's .prop("tagName") as well.
[08:25:45] <jp-> http://jsfiddle.net/jAb2b/22/
[08:27:30] <Syrit> yes, it works with "is " as well jp-  , http://jsfiddle.net/jAb2b/24/ , thank you so much for your help as well :) i really appreciate it
[08:27:49] <jp-> sure, no problem
[08:52:16] <LoneSoldier728> hey is there anyway to crawl your own inbox and pull every email address that emailed you out?
[08:52:30] <grafi> oô
[08:52:36] <grafi> like gmail?
[08:52:44] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[08:52:48] <LoneSoldier728> it is a gmail account
[08:53:24] <LoneSoldier728> any idea?
[08:54:01] <grafi> can you see all email that you want to grab?
[08:54:08] <grafi> then its probably doable
[08:54:15] <LoneSoldier728> ya it is in my inbox
[08:54:22] <jp-> LoneSoldier728, with jquery? no idea, with another language? use an imap library for said language and pull the headers for each email in the inbox.
[08:54:29] <grafi> dont use gmail myself so i dont know the html structure
[08:54:53] <grafi> jp- you could just iterate all mails and extract the adresses
[08:54:54] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: https://www.google.com/contacts/ and "Other Contacts" mayhaps?
[08:54:55] <LoneSoldier728> what languanges can i do it with, i know powershell for scripting
[08:54:57] <grafi> shouldnt be too hard
[08:55:40] <BillCriswell> Oh, you want to script it out.
[08:56:29] <LoneSoldier728> ya or w.e
[08:57:37] <BillCriswell> https://developers.google.com/google-apps/contacts/v3/?csw=1
[08:57:57] <BillCriswell> Oh you didn't say gmail specifically.
[08:58:00] <BillCriswell> Sorry abotu that.
[08:58:04] <LoneSoldier728> it says the contacts was not enabled
[08:58:11] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[08:59:14] <LoneSoldier728> http://www.labnol.org/internet/extract-gmail-addresses/28037/
[09:00:35] <LoneSoldier728> not sure how i run that
[09:01:51] <duch_kazatel> LoneSoldier728 the instructions are in that link - right under the screenshot of what it gets you.
[09:02:07] <Danny^^P> Hi! I've build a function which adds dynamically some <input type="checkbox"> Fields to a div Container. That works fine. When the user clicks on a button, another function should loop around the added input element. I tried to use $('#storage > input').each(function() {        where storage is the ID of the div container. But each doesn't loop around the input elements
[09:02:07] <duch_kazatel> "
[09:02:56] <LoneSoldier728> ya but how is the code initialized
[09:03:12] <duch_kazatel> Danny^^P - have a fiddle of your code?  sounds like you're not binding your event correctly.
[09:03:41] <duch_kazatel> and LoneSoldier728 that uses this - http://ctrlq.org/code/19476-extract-email
[09:03:48] <LoneSoldier728> ah nvm
[09:03:50] <LoneSoldier728> it says it
[09:04:01] <duch_kazatel> it's using the javascript API for google apps.
[09:04:08] <LoneSoldier728> oh but it is used on that account
[09:04:20] <LoneSoldier728> can i transfer it to a csv off the account somehow?
[09:04:40] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:04:53] <duch_kazatel> are you just looking for a list of everybody that's sent you emails?
[09:05:12] <Danny^^P> duch_kazatel: I have no jsfiddle at the moment. The events seems to be bind correct. I have added some alerts before and after the each function. They are displayed
[09:05:15] <duch_kazatel> because that's what that script does.
[09:06:02] <duch_kazatel> Danny^^P it sounds like you're binding directly to the inputs before they exist in the document - what event bidning syntax are you using?
[09:06:03] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[09:06:05] <LoneSoldier728> duch
[09:06:23] <LoneSoldier728> but i want to have it export it to a csv that is not on the account
[09:06:44] <duch_kazatel> then save that list?
[09:06:48] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: So you want someone to be able to give you their login information and grab their email addresses?
[09:07:21] <LoneSoldier728> no others can see the account but I am admin
[09:07:39] <LoneSoldier728> i dont want my employees to have access to the doc
[09:07:58] <LoneSoldier728> if that makes sense
[09:08:56] <LoneSoldier728> ok it is all good
[09:09:00] <LoneSoldier728> ill just do it this way
[09:11:14] <Danny^^P> duch_kazatel: Here is an example of the relevant code: http://pastebin.com/Qy2yULfc
[09:17:14] <zizzl> Hey guys is there a way to have an element animate from a top:0 to whatever is defined in css?
[09:32:34] <jphase> zizzl: set a variable to your element's .css('top') value and then do $('div').css('top', 0).animate({top: myvariable}, 500);
[09:32:39] <jphase> is that what you mean?
[09:38:18] <zizzl> jphase sort of.. but on the .animate, use the css that's in the stylesheet
[09:39:47] <jphase> zizzl: .css('top') should return the top value from the stylesheet
[09:40:08] <jphase> unless you've changed it after doc ready or something
[09:44:28] <soahccc> Can someone recommend a really compact and easy library for basic string manipulations? jQuery core doesn't seem to help me with that and the closest thing I could find is underscore JS string extension but first I don't really like the underscore sort of accessor and that plugins seems to implement every possible string manipulation
[09:45:28] <andrew__1> How can I download a minified form of jQuery_UI
[09:45:51] <amirite_> underscore is a really good lib
[09:45:55] <amirite_> use it
[09:46:29] <amirite_> just copy and paste the underscore mixin you found into your own file and everytime you think one of their functions is deficient, fix it or implement a new one
[09:46:32] <amirite_> should be light
[09:50:20] <soahccc> amirite_: Okay I'll try to extract needed functions then. I do a lot of stuff unnecessarily on the server and would like to change it but these "usability barriers" get me at every attempt to do so ;)
[09:53:36] <power> help me guys
[09:53:48] <power> there is a jquery
[09:53:54] <jphase> ?
[09:54:14] <power> which shows error on web but runs fine when i run it on my local machine
[09:54:31] <power> *unexpected synatx error
[09:55:12] <jphase> power: Go to jsfiddle.net and make a fiddle of it so we can see
[09:58:32] <power> http://jsfiddle.net/VHaZt/
[09:58:52] <power> jphase: help
[09:59:50] <jphase> erm, hehe, this is just the jquery mobile library pasted in there power
[10:00:23] <power> then why it is showing error
[10:00:43] <jphase> well there's several reasons why this particular fiddle is erroneous
[10:01:03] <jphase> firstly you need jquery, secondly you should be including the jquery mobile script as an external resource in jsfiddle
[10:01:19] <jphase> power: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.1/  this should show you how to use this properly
[10:01:53] <jphase> or more specifically http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.1/docs/about/getting-started.html
[10:02:20] <power> the file works fine offline
[10:02:36] <power> but when i host it with a heroku server
[10:02:40] <power> it shows error
[10:02:57] <jphase> power: Do you have a link to your heroku app?
[10:03:12] <power> http://stormy-basin-8851.herokuapp.com/
[10:05:31] <jphase> power: does including jquery mobile from google fix it?   <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.min.js"></script>
[10:05:55] <power> i can't include it with any linl
[10:05:57] <power> *link
[10:06:08] <power> it should be downlaoded
[10:06:15] <power> pushed to the repo
[10:06:20] <power> hosted to a server
[10:06:29] <power> :(
[10:07:12] <jphase> oh I linked you wrong anyhow hehe
[10:08:43] <power> does my jquery (library) contains error
[10:09:02] <jphase> I'd start by making sure your jquerymobile library is correct
[10:09:28] <jphase> the code from jquerymobile:   http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.3.2/jquery.mobile-1.3.2.min.js   is not the same as yours:   http://stormy-basin-8851.herokuapp.com/jquery.mobile-1.3.2.min.js
[10:10:04] <power> apart from the first comment line
[10:10:11] <jphase> power: and if you want to get rid of your jquery .map error you can move "//@ sourceMappingURL=jquery.min.map" up on the first line in your jquery library
[10:11:27] <power> thank you :)
[10:11:34] <power> for your help sir
[10:11:35] <power> :)
[10:11:58] <jphase> np, hard to tell the problem really but I can help you make educated guesses :]
[10:12:28] <LoneSoldier728> hey so if I use a script to pull all the email addresses from ym account does it become a problem with google if I have over 20k emails that it is going thru or it does not matter
[10:13:19] <jphase> LoneSoldier728: if you're sending 20k emails through Google in one fell swoop I suspect you won't be their favorite user heh
[10:13:41] <jphase> typically something like sendgrid.net is used for that, or a campaign service like mailchimp.com or constantcontact.com
[10:19:03] <zizzl> jphase this can't be right  $('.pin').css('top', 0).animate({$(this).css('top')}, 500);
[10:20:44] <zizzl> or this $('.pin').css('top', 0).animate({"top" : "$(this).css('top')}", 500);
[10:20:54] <jphase> zizzl: once you set the top by doing .css('top', 0) then when you get the top value it will return 0
[10:21:02] <LoneSoldier728> it isnt sending
[10:21:09] <jphase> so you need to set a variable or something first
[10:21:11] <LoneSoldier728> it is just getting the headers (email addresses out)
[10:21:28] <jphase> var mytop = $('.pin').css('top');
[10:21:46] <jphase> $('.pin').css('top', 0).animate({top: mytop}, 500);
[10:21:52] <jphase> something like that anyway
[10:22:05] <zizzl> jphase well what I want to do is have various pins drop from 0 to their respective defined position in the css sheet
[10:22:07] <zizzl> any idea?
[10:22:09] <jphase> LoneSoldier728: idk, I'd check your mail log
[10:22:41] <jphase> zizzl: in theory the example I gave you should work
[10:22:51] <jphase> the one I just gave you that is
[10:24:12] <jphase> zizzl: the problem is, as soon as you do .css('top', 0) then you no longer can access the stylesheet value with .css('top')   (cause it will be 0 from then on)
[10:24:20] <LoneSoldier728> where can i find my mail log?
[10:24:49] <jphase> LoneSoldier728: I'm not really sure what language you're using, what server architecture, or anything really
[10:25:18] <jphase> LoneSoldier728: I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to do honestly
[10:34:24] * plambwk- slaps doug65536 around a bit with a large trout
[10:36:34] <AWildBass> Touch My Bass!
[10:36:47] <buzzedword> no?
[10:40:01] <buzzedword> LoneSoldier728: Can you outline specifically what you're trying to do, from end to end?
[10:40:51] <buzzedword> it occurs to me that making a "Dirty Love" reference is probably the strangest way to start helping. ...oh well.
[10:54:01] <BillCriswell> What is the mIRC command for the large trout thing? Forgot all about that.
[10:54:07] <BillCriswell> /slap <someone> ?
[10:54:32] <jphase> BillCriswell: I think you right click their name from what I remember, it's a client thing not a server command
[10:54:46] <jphase> haven't use windows in a very long time though so idk
[10:55:05] <BillCriswell> jphase: Ah. That wouldn't feel nearly as cool.
[10:55:23] <jphase> heh
[10:55:27] <jphase> maybe there is a /slap idk?
[10:55:31] <BillCriswell> /me doesn't know how to use trouts as a weapon.
[10:55:38] <jphase> 10:55 <freenode> Error(421): SLAP Unknown command
[10:55:59] <jphase> you could make a tcl script alias for it if you open up your scripts in mIRC :)
[10:59:18] <BillCriswell> jphase: Haha. Haven't heard TCL in a while. =(
[11:00:16] <jphase> BillCriswell: open up your "Alias" tab in your scripting section and put in something like:
[11:00:41] <jphase> ... /slap /me slaps $1 around a bit with a large trout.
[11:00:56] <jphase> then you should be able to type /slap jphase I believe
[11:01:31] <jphase> it might be $$1 instead of $1 I can't remember
[11:03:38] <talntid> its $1
[11:03:43] <talntid> also, could just type..
[11:04:04] <talntid> /alias slap { me slaps $1 around a bit with a large trout. }
[11:04:18] <talntid> so he doesn't have to find the alias section
[11:04:21] <jphase> oooo naiz talntid
[11:04:54] <talntid> 4 years of being a dalnet #helpdesk SOp... there's really nothing about mirc i don't know... lol :\
[11:04:55] <jphase> been > 1 decade since I opened up mIRC
[11:06:15] <oal> Is there a jquery plugin that lets me create a mind map like thing there "nodes" are connected to eachother and linked? Something like http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hph.html, but interactive
[11:10:36] <aro> is there a way to trigger a bootstrap modal without using a container for it
[11:10:45] <aro> (ie: got the html stored in a JS var)
[11:13:49] <BillCriswell> oal: Hmmm.. https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery something here may help?
[11:14:17] <BillCriswell> I feel dumber and dumber the more I scroll down this page.
[11:14:42] <moparisthebest> I need to detect the media type in javascript, is there any way to do that?
[11:14:52] <oal> BillCriswell, heh, yeah, I was looking for something simpler. D3 is a beast :)
[11:15:00] <moparisthebest> I can apply, for example, a stylesheet only for printing with media="print"
[11:15:08] <BillCriswell> oal: It sure seems so.
[11:15:33] <moparisthebest> so I thought of applying hidden or a different width to a div with the print css, and looking at that with javascript, but it returns the first value, not the print value
[11:15:46] <BillCriswell> Ah, the data structures look like what I thought, interesting.
[11:18:54] <BillCriswell> aro: Why do you just add the HTML to a <div id="modal"></div> or something and run it on that?
[11:20:34] <BillCriswell> You can do like $('a').on('click', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $('#modal').html( htmlString ).modal(); });
[11:23:52] <G1eb> whats this thing with :contains, i cant make it work case insensitive on v1.9
[11:24:11] <G1eb> all these 'extend' solutions fail..
[11:25:09] <BillCriswell> G1eb: I'd use filter.
[11:25:55] <BillCriswell> $('span').filter(function(){ return $(this).text().toLowerCase().indexOf('search') > -1 }).addClass('has-search');
[11:26:04] <aro> is there a way to prevent a form from submitting until after a modal is done loading?
[11:26:54] <G1eb> BillCriswell: thanks ill try that instead
[11:27:22] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/oZuWEHi/1/edit weeeee!
[11:28:41] <G1eb> quick.. :P nice
[11:29:01] <jphase> aro: just do a $('form').submit(function(){ if(mymodal isn't there) return false; }); type of thing
[11:29:07] <stalecache> was bored and made a crawling bug, it turned out pretty nice it think: http://jsfiddle.net/NKT6Q/
[11:32:28] <BillCriswell> stalecache: I just keep thinking of a poor fly who can't get out the window.
[11:33:50] <stalecache> BillCriswell, haha, your so right, never thought of it that way
[11:34:29] <oal> Is there something like raphael.js, but with collision detection built in?
[11:34:43] <BillCriswell> I wonder how much that says about someone who sees that in different ways.
[11:35:06] <BillCriswell> stalecache: Like if it's trying to fly towards you or away from you, or if it's just crawling around and not struggling at all.
[11:35:56] <BillCriswell> oal: Not my area of expertise. =(
[11:36:38] <anli> Why is this no adding spaces in the beginning of the dropdown item? http://jsfiddle.net/hKFJn/
[11:36:57] <stalecache> BillCriswell, i wanted to make it look realistic like it was on top of the screen and people would try to wipe it off
[11:37:12] <aro> how do you programmatically submit a form with jquery?
[11:37:13] <BillCriswell> anli: It is, it just doesn't show visually.
[11:37:41] <anli> So I need to use &nbsp; then and .html, right?
[11:38:33] <BillCriswell> anli: Don't think that'll work.
[11:38:57] <anli> But there are ways to add spaces at the beginning of options
[11:39:03] <BillCriswell> anli: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25752/how-do-i-put-a-space-character-before-option-text-in-a-html-select-element could help.
[11:39:52] <BillCriswell> anli: <optgroup> might be a less gross?
[11:40:05] <anli> Dunno, never used them
[11:40:45] <anli> Ah, you mean to add indentation in that way
[11:40:56] <aro> $.submit() doesnt seem to work
[11:40:56] <BillCriswell> It'll group the options.. the display would be up to the browser.
[11:41:08] <anli> oh
[11:42:16] <BillCriswell> anli: You'd have to use just .html().
[11:42:32] <anli> The same, I need to convert spaces before
[11:42:32] <BillCriswell> I was overcomplicating. =/
[11:44:50] <aro> sigh
[11:45:08] <anli> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/hKFJn/1/
[11:45:22] <anli> Seems to be how to do it
[11:45:43] <BillCriswell> aro: Do $('form').trigger('submit')
[11:46:06] <BillCriswell> anli: Nice. Are you doing that to show hierarchy or is it just style?
[11:46:13] <anli> hierarchy
[11:46:16] <anli> ugly, but true
[11:46:30] <anli> It is probably better to use paddding
[11:46:33] <anli> If possible
[11:48:12] <aro> bill that didnt work
[11:48:15] <aro> but i did just figure it out
[11:48:46] <BillCriswell> aro: Okie doke.
[11:48:56] <aro> $(form).on('submit', function() { this.submit() });
[11:49:00] <aro> i had to use that
[11:49:01] <BillCriswell> anli: I'm not sure.
[11:49:08] <aro> not the $(this) wrpaper
[11:49:10] <aro> wrapper
[11:49:50] <BillCriswell> aro: You want to submit the form while it's submitting?
[11:50:13] <BillCriswell> anli: padding didn't seem to work.
[11:50:15] <anli> Strange, the indentation goes to the right in the selectbox, but not in the dropdown where it goes to the left, http://jsfiddle.net/hKFJn/2/
[11:50:54] <BillCriswell> anli: Also noticed optgroups can't be nested.
[11:51:10] <anli> oh
[11:51:11] <anli> ok
[11:51:29] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/edipeBe/1/edit?html,output think that's pretty close,though
[11:52:19] <anli> :)
[12:03:04] <rufsketch1> hey all
[12:04:02] <rufsketch1> I'm trying to make an ajax spinner appear using the show and hide functions. But for whatever reason, it only seems to show up in firefox.
[12:05:26] <rufsketch1> I'm thinking it has something to do with the .animate functions I call after the ajax completes, because that's the only other place firefox is showing inconsistent behavior
[12:05:43] <rufsketch1> where can I find information about .animate inconsistencies between browsers?
[12:07:40] <BillCriswell> rufsketch1: If you have it up somewhere a link would get you help a lot quicker.
[12:11:46] <rufsketch1> BillCriswell: just a sec, will pastebin it
[12:12:27] <rufsketch1> BillCriswell: also, just replace the .animate functions with .css ones, and that didn't resolve the issue. So it's likely not .animate.
[12:13:20] <BillCriswell> rufsketch1: Yeah, if it's working in one browser and not the other I'm thinking just something weird with CSS.
[12:14:25] <BillCriswell> Changes are pastbin'ing it will help you find the issue as well. At least, that's how it usually goes for me.
[12:17:21] <rufsketch1> BillCriswell: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Ciacujck
[12:18:23] <BillCriswell> I was expecting that to be much less code.
[12:18:24] <rufsketch1> BillCriswell: I guess the relevant lines are    jQuery.ajaxSetup({
[12:18:34] <rufsketch1> BillCriswell: yeah sorry about that
[12:18:58] <rufsketch1> I can tease out the relevant sections, just a sec
[12:19:00] <BillCriswell> rufsketch1: $($("#level_navigator #ajax-loader")[0]) can simply be $("#level_navigator #ajax-loader")
[12:19:25] <rufsketch1> BillCriswell: yeah, that was a "this isn't working I'll just be overly specific" type of thing
[12:19:29] <BillCriswell> As with the line after that... you're kind of using jquery, stipping it away and applying it again forom what I can tell.
[12:20:15] <BillCriswell> Also, $('#ajax-loader').show() and $('#ajax-loader').hide() should be enough, two ids in a selector overkill.
[12:21:02] <rufsketch1> BillCriswell: trying to make it modular, so want to avoid accidentally selecting some other ajax loader that might be on the page.
[12:21:33] <BillCriswell> rufsketch1: Should be using a class then. You shouldn't use the same ID twice in one document.
[12:21:42] <duch_kazatel> what BillCriswell
[12:21:47] <duch_kazatel> *err, what BillCriswell said
[12:22:12] <rufsketch1> right fair. I should actually change all of the ids to classes
[12:22:21] <rufsketch1> if this is to be modular
[12:22:36] <rufsketch1> well, within reason I guess
[12:23:00] <rufsketch1> anywho, so aside from those things, which I don't imagine are the problem
[12:23:11] <rufsketch1> any clue as to why it works in firefox but not webkit or ie?
[12:25:39] <BillCriswell> rufsketch1: Are you sure it's not just a CSS issue? Like if you inspect the element does the display change?
[12:26:15] <rufsketch1> BillCriswell: if I inspect the element, the display does not change.
[12:26:55] <rufsketch1> BillCriswell: however, if I call log .css("display") on the element, it shows that it has changed
[12:27:33] <rufsketch1> if I run the debugger, the element shows when it should
[12:28:25] <rufsketch1> err if I log .css("display")
[12:28:50] <BillCriswell> So if you just add that property to the element it displays on the site?
[12:29:40] <BillCriswell> If you do console.log('beforeSend'); and console.log('complete') respectively do both logs happen in firefox at the expected time?
[12:31:28] <rufsketch1> let me check
[12:32:24] <rufsketch1> BillCriswell: no, the lag between before and complete is commensurate with the server response time.
[12:33:17] <rufsketch1> BillCriswell: and in firefox, the spinner ajax-loader icon shows in that timeframe.
[12:33:53] <BillCriswell> rufsketch1: I meant to ask if it was happening at the right times in Chrome.
[12:34:00] <BillCriswell> I got mixed up on which wasn't working.
[12:34:13] <rufsketch1> BillCriswell: the timing in chrome also seems to be correct.
[12:34:41] <rufsketch1> BillCriswell: and artificially elongating the time between before and complete does not result in a display of the element
[12:36:14] <BillCriswell> Does the element hide and show in Chrome?
[12:36:24] <BillCriswell> According to the CSS properties
[12:38:21] <rufsketch1> BillCriswell: according to the element inspector no
[12:38:28] <rufsketch1> BillCriswell: according to the jquery selector, yes
[12:39:35] <BillCriswell> rufsketch1: Hard to tell without poking around.
[12:40:34] <rufsketch1> BillCriswell: hmm, alright. I'll keep looking around, and if I have no luck, I'll set it up stuff on a publicly accessible server
[12:40:44] <BillCriswell> Awesome.
[12:55:33] <lintguy> Noob question: How do i append text to a string on each iteration?
[12:55:43] <lintguy> *string variable
[12:58:55] <lintguy> Nevermind.
[12:59:43] <BillCriswell> lintguy: Dammit. I could have answered that one.
[13:00:19] <lintguy> Well, i got stuck again
[13:01:49] <lintguy> BillCriswell: I tried creating an empty variable, then do varName+'mytext' on each iteration, but then when i output the variable outside of the each iteration, it prints it 3 times anyway.
[13:02:27] <BillCriswell> lintguy: +=
[13:03:14] <BillCriswell> It would then be like valuemytext then valuemytextmytext then valuemytextmytextmytext
[13:03:34] <lintguy> Oh, so i add + before = on the var?
[13:04:33] <BillCriswell> lintguy: Yes, if you want to keep appending to the string like that.
[13:05:03] <lintguy> BillCriswell: Hm, i get unexpected token += if i do taht
[13:06:14] <BillCriswell> lintguy: http://jsbin.com/OREboce/1/edit not getting there here.
[13:07:45] <BillCriswell> getting that here*
[13:07:53] <lintguy> BillCriswell: Ah, if i remove var - it works
[13:08:02] <lintguy> BillCriswell: thanks for the help°!
[13:08:09] <BillCriswell> No problem at all.
[13:11:37] <boytoy> At http://jsbin.com/ekoHONU/3/edit -- anybody know how to replace jQuery Mobile's loader with https://github.com/rstacruz/nprogress/?
[13:16:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> hi
[13:16:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> this is probably more a php question
[13:17:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> but nonetheless i must verify that
[13:17:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> my jquery is working properly
[13:17:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> https://gist.github.com/rohanbhangui/6690606
[13:17:25] <kaldrenon> A button of mine has two classes. Both classes are bound in $(document).on('click') arrangements. Is there any way for me to control the order in which these fire?
[13:17:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> this gist shows the relevent code.
[13:17:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> currently the .always callback returns 'undefined'
[13:17:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> im am mistified as to why this coe doesnt work
[13:18:06] <NoiseEee> kaldrenon: in that case, i'd maybe give the button an ID and fire two calls explicitly
[13:18:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> i have used that exact code before and now it doesnt work
[13:18:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> any help?
[13:21:22] <kaldrenon> NoiseEee: I'm not sure I follow you. One of the classes is one that's applied in a lot of places in my project and changes CSS when it triggers. I want to be sure the CSS of the button has been changed before the other code gets to it
[13:23:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> any ideas anyone?
[13:23:33] <davesleeeep> right, so i got this thing working, where it returns results from a DB, and when i click the image it full screens and greys out the back
[13:23:42] <davesleeeep> what i want now is to be able to go left/right through my search resuls
[13:23:54] <davesleeeep> how reliable is .next();
[13:24:06] <jphase> davesleeeep:  as reliable as your markup
[13:24:13] <davesleeeep> what does that mean ;/
[13:24:23] <jphase> if it's the next HTML element it works
[13:24:25] <davesleeeep> as in, if everything is perfectly aligned it should be okaY?
[13:24:36] <jphase> yeah
[13:24:41] <davesleeeep> what if i have rows? will it pick them up?
[13:24:48] <davesleeeep> as the next item? (sorry i keep pressing enter)
[13:24:49] <jphase> no, only the next sibling
[13:25:01] <davesleeeep> hrm, k, time to think of a way around this
[13:25:03] <jphase> literally the html element that's right next to it (not the parent)
[13:25:22] <davesleeeep> that's what i thought
[13:25:44] <davesleeeep> i can taste the near completion of this website
[13:26:06] <jphase> .closest might work for what you need, it grabs siblings and parents (the closest match while traversing up the DOM)
[13:26:08] <davesleeeep> you got a good bit of code to use to strip js/jquery ?
[13:26:21] <jphase> strip?
[13:26:23] <davesleeeep> for database storage stuff
[13:26:34] <davesleeeep> yeah, to prevent XSS?
[13:26:57] <jphase> oh, well if you're concerned about that you could use your server-side language to strip that
[13:27:02] <jphase> striptags() in php for example
[13:27:08] <davesleeeep> is that safe enough?
[13:27:16] <davesleeeep> hrm ill have a gander
[13:27:25] <jphase> it should strip all html recursively
[13:27:50] <jphase> I mean, you don't want to sanitize on the JS side anyway
[13:28:00] <NoiseEee> davesleeeep: don't use that, use htmlspecialchars when outputting (if you
[13:28:05] <jphase> cause I could just write my own code that pwns yours in my console ;)
[13:28:08] <NoiseEee> ... 're using PHP)
[13:28:23] <jphase> that will keep the chars though
[13:28:27] <njk> how do you use a private channel
[13:28:41] <jphase> if you want only text or something with no tags, you may want to just strip, depends on the application. CMS
[13:28:48] <jphase> (permature enter key)
[13:29:09] <jphase> CMS' use htmlspecialchars typically
[13:30:35] <davesleeeep> aye ill look into it

[14:09:35] <kiba> Hello.
[14:11:51] <jphase> hi
[14:11:56] <kiba> I am trying to capture any kind of keypress event using $().keypress(function() {console.log("blah");})
[14:11:59] <kiba> But no dice
[14:12:54] <BillCriswell> kiba: $('body').on('keypress', function(e){ console.log( e ); });
[14:13:32] <kiba> Thank you.
[14:14:07] <kiba> BillCriswell: But that is not jquery code?
[14:14:23] <BillCriswell> kiba: It is.
[14:14:29] <archfool> jQuery Mobile, re collapsibles and collapsible-sets: How do I get a child of collapsible-set to NOT indent and be same width as parent?
[14:14:38] <kiba> What's wrong with .keypress rather than on?
[14:14:44] <BillCriswell> You doing $() doesn't return anything. You need an element to wait for the event on.
[14:15:06] <BillCriswell> kiba: That's the preferred way now. You can do $('body').keypress(function(e){ console.log( e ); }); just as well.
[14:15:43] <archfool> never mind.  I figgered it out.
[14:15:55] * archfool slinks back quietly underneath the sofa
[14:16:19] <kiba> Thanks.
[14:17:49] <Day105> Looking for a web designer for an on-going project, we have backend developers, long - term html/css/js, pm me please, thanks.
[14:18:57] <BillCriswell> No problem kiba.
[14:19:42] * kiba is trying to figure out how to trigger tab event.
[14:21:11] <kiba> I can capture normal events like a b c d e f etc
[14:21:15] <kiba> but I can't capture tab.
[14:25:50] <tracker1> Looking for a plugin, or wanting to make one that raises events for near/far (meaning a mouse is near or over an element, and away from an element).
[14:26:19] <tracker1> Is anyone aware of such a plugin, and if not... is there a way to get a list of elements bound to "EVENTNAME"?
[14:26:50] <tracker1> would prefer to simply have one event listener for mousemove events and throttled raises when near/away from those listening.
[14:29:33] <anew> does a plugin exist for an image tooltip that resizes the image based on browser dimensions
[14:29:36] <snoop> Tracker1: I am not sure I understood what you are looking for excatlly could you elaborate?
[14:29:42] <anew> cant find one anywhere, dont think it exists ?
[14:30:21] <tracker1> snoop... I have an element on a page... I want to know when the mouse is near/over and when the mouse far/out
[14:30:25] <tracker1> not just over/out
[14:30:58] <tracker1> if no such plugin exists, my question is... is there a way to get a match for all elements bound for "near" or "far"
[14:32:15] <snoop> I think you can I did watch a tutorial about this using javascript
[14:32:53] <tracker1> I can do the events... but only want one mousemove listener, that then passes to matching near/far elements
[14:33:12] <tracker1> wanting to tie into the built in bind methods
[14:33:33] <tracker1> so on my element  $("selector").near(handler).far(farHandler)
[14:34:18] <tracker1> near/far will simply this.bind("near",...) and this.bind("far",...)  but in my mousemove, I need all elements bound to "near" or "far"
[14:34:25] <tracker1> to check if they're nearby.
[14:35:07] <snoop> when you say all elements do you mean the selector element
[14:35:35] <snoop> $("selector")
[14:35:50] <tracker1> snoop... I mean.. if I have  $(set1).bind("near", handler) .... I want to get anything that is bound to "near"
[14:36:16] <tracker1> I want to get all elements that have called .bind("near",...)
[14:36:39] <tracker1> anything listening for "near"
[14:37:17] <snoop> got it
[14:37:36] <tracker1> $(window).bind("mousemove", function(){ ... need list of elements bound to "near" here ... })
[14:39:50] <sahbeewah> tracker1, not really technically feasible
[14:39:56] <sahbeewah> what are you trying to achieve?
[14:40:46] <tracker1> a generic near/far plugin.... $("#mysomething").bind("near", ...) ... with a single global handler for window mousemove
[14:41:01] <tracker1> that will see if there is anything bound to near, that is near... raising an event...
[14:41:03] <tracker1> same for far
[14:41:27] <tracker1> I could override $.fn.bind/unbind but didn't know if there was already functionality for this.
[14:42:32] <tracker1> I don't want dozens of listeners for mousemove events
[14:44:08] <snoop> I am still trying to figure out if its possible
[14:45:12] <tracker1> I mean, I could select * and check each element's _data["events"] or whatever, but would rather have a simpler selector...
[14:47:13] <sahbeewah> i think the bigger challenge would be discovering the elements that are actually near to your cursor
[14:47:17] <sahbeewah> if that was the intention
[14:47:48] <sahbeewah> you can't really answer the question "which elements have an x event handler"
[14:48:21] <sahbeewah> so you'd need to keep track of what you bind in a variable
[14:49:28] <guspollos> anyone knows an easy opensource auction platform?
[14:53:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have an array which I loop through with $.each - how can it possibly that at 1 point in the loop, the value is undefined
[14:53:17] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ?
[14:53:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> $.each(allinstances, function(instancekey, instancevalue) {} );
[14:53:29] <snoop> its going to be tuff to track it :(
[14:53:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> when I log allinstances variable it has 5 elements, and after 3 loops it stops and says instancevalue is not defined!
[14:53:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How can it be?!
[14:54:16] <tracker1> sahbeewah, will probably wrap $.fn.bind to check for my events, and have them in an array..
[14:54:57] <tracker1> sahbeewah, was just hoping there might be a built in method.
[14:56:24] <tracker1> var ary = [1,2,3,undefined,5]
[14:56:25] <snoop> ecky: whatever element you are looping over must not have a value in it
[14:56:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Oh I know why.... because I remove elements from the array inside the loop... but the problem is, the loop is to remove elements from the array
[14:57:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> By index...
[14:57:14] <sahbeewah> tracker1, overriding a built-in is rarely ever a good idea
[14:57:27] <ecky--ptang-zoob> of course when I remove 1 by index, the loop count is not correct anymore... but how to fix this?
[14:57:29] <tracker1> sahbeewah, I know, that's why I asked if there was a better way first
[14:58:20] <tracker1> ecky, if it's an array, use a for loop, and i-- when you remove an item.
[14:58:21] <sahbeewah> without knowing any further info, you'd probably be best storing a list of near/far handlers with $.data(window, 'near/far')
[14:58:51] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but suppose in the loop index 4 is removed from the original array, won't all indexes shift then?
[14:58:59] <ecky--ptang-zoob> making the i incorrect
[14:58:59] <tracker1> sahbeewah, but I want subscribers to simply be able to do $("#myelem").bind("near",...)
[14:59:15] <tracker1> ecky--ptang-zoob, not when you remove the i
[14:59:35] <ecky--ptang-zoob> tracker: can I show you the code?
[15:00:02] <tracker1> for (var i=0; i<ary.length; i++) { ... if (toBeRmovedCondition) { ary.splice...; i-- } }
[15:00:13] <garbagecollectio> can i pass other property names to an ajax object
[15:00:30] <garbagecollectio> besides the ones in the documentation
[15:00:31] <garbagecollectio> and be ok
[15:01:05] <tracker1> ecky--ptang-zoob, if you like... jsfiddle?
[15:01:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[15:02:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I must add that the array is an array of objects
[15:02:44] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but that's not relevant i guess
[15:02:53] <sahbeewah> tracker1, i don't see how that's a problem. you just need to trigger "near" in your plugin when it is appropriate to
[15:03:41] <tracker1> sahbeewah, how do I know what objects are near, without knowing which objects are expecting to be near?
[15:04:13] <tracker1> without overriding bind
[15:05:14] <sahbeewah> tracker1, even if you could determine which elements have a near handler, that would be an issue
[15:06:37] <tracker1> if I know which elements have a "near" listener, I could iterate through them... if I throttle mousemove events to no more than one per 100ms, should be fine with fewer than 100 listeners.
[15:06:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> tracker1: http://jsfiddle.net/byjEq/
[15:06:55] <tracker1> sahbeewah, last comment was for you
[15:08:31] <tracker1> ecky--ptang-zoob, in your example allinstances is an object not an array...
[15:08:43] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yes sorry, should be []
[15:08:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but that I have correct in my code
[15:10:40] <tracker1> ecky--ptang-zoob, http://jsfiddle.net/byjEq/
[15:11:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Wrong paste?
[15:12:36] <tracker1> http://jsfiddle.net/tracker1/4t3L2/
[15:12:39] <tracker1> sorry
[15:12:44] <sahbeewah> yeah. so you $.data(window, 'near', [list of elements with near handlers, appended to upon attachment]), then you iterate through them on mouse move
[15:13:05] <tracker1> sahbeewah, how do I have that list, without overriding bind/unbind?
[15:13:21] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok let's see
[15:13:24] <talntid> easy fix, tracker1
[15:16:30] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yeah ok, that works, thx!
[15:16:37] <tracker1> ecky--ptang-zoob, np
[15:16:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> if that array is part of an object and ALL indexes are removed, will the array still live?
[15:17:45] <tracker1> yes
[15:18:00] <tracker1> if (ary.length === 0) ary = null;
[15:18:13] <tracker1> if you want to clear it... or   if (ary.length === 0) delete ary;
[15:18:26] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[15:22:23] <garbagecollectio> can you append
[15:22:41] <garbagecollectio> any property to an ajax obj
[15:23:10] <garbagecollectio> and have it still work
[15:38:06] <aMoniker> Does anyone know about $.fn.resizable? My resize event doesn't seem to fire when dragging the top handle above the element, but it does work when dragging below the element...
[15:38:47] <culh> I'm updating a div element, unsing a recursive function to append new <p> elements for everytime there's new content. Now I'm trying to scrollTop(), but not quite getting it right. The length is increasing and so is the height of the div element, so why isn't the scrollTop() functioning as it should?
[15:40:43] <boytoy> At http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/dn4mj/2/ -- how do I check if homo-sapiens is a descendant of australopithecus?
[15:42:42] <aMoniker> boytoy: For you it's easy - look in the mirror.
[15:42:51] <culh> please take a look: http://pastebin.com/778rBV8K
[15:43:04] <boytoy> aMoniker: he he :)
[15:43:18] <doug65536> boytoy: you already do, in the 2nd one
[15:43:29] <mysteronyx> on the following page in the first example, why does it say var result = create()(5); ? Is that proper syntax to pass a value to a function? http://tinyurl.com/lh2j59f
[15:43:42] <mysteronyx> I'm not used to seeing two ()() like that
[15:43:48] <doug65536> boytoy: in the first one, you can use .has
[15:44:07] <doug65536> mysteronyx: create() returns a function, and it calls that (returned) function with 5 as the parameter
[15:44:47] <mysteronyx> doug65536, so if the returned function returned a function within it, I could theoretically do create()()(5)?
[15:44:51] <mysteronyx> theoretically continue on with the (), I mean
[15:44:54] <boytoy> doug65536: thats great.. perfect..
[15:44:56] <doug65536> mysteronyx: yes
[15:44:59] <mysteronyx> ok thanks
[15:47:18] <aMoniker> Is there a way to specify a helper element using jQuery UI resizable? It seems like something you can do with lots of other plugins...
[15:47:28] <aMoniker> though resizable seems like it might have some issues
[15:50:51] <thesisb> If I do: $('#element').find('.className').jqueryPlugin({ 'key':  **** });
[15:51:11] <thesisb> Can the *** be a $(this) refering to the internal '.className' from the internal each?
[15:51:37] <doug65536> thesisb: no, this won't change because it happens to be there in that line
[15:52:16] <doug65536> thankfully :)
[15:52:54] <thesisb> so I've got to do then: $('#element').find('.className').each(function() {   $(this).pluginName({ key: $(this).data('attrname') }) });?
[15:53:02] <thesisb> double each?
[15:53:04] <doug65536> thesisb: 'this' is nothing more than a hidden parameter to the function, that happens to be set when you call something with something.method()
[15:54:24] <doug65536> thesisb: 'this' won't change in the middle of a  function. it will be the same 'this' as it was before that whole line
[15:54:50] <doug65536> thesisb: if there were a callback there (function() { ... }) then inside that ... part might have a different 'this'
[15:56:04] <doug65536> thesisb: ah yes, the each will set 'this'
[15:56:06] <doug65536> missed that
[15:56:25] <thesisb> yea
[15:56:32] <thesisb> k thanks - was hoping didnt have to do that
[15:58:17] <doug65536> thesisb: why not $('#element .className').each...
[15:59:13] <thesisb> bad example, in the original #element is already a JS variable used elsewhere
[15:59:21] <thesisb> $el.find( etc
[15:59:34] <doug65536> thesisb: ok, there is a shorter syntax for that too, scoped selector
[15:59:43] <doug65536> thesisb: $('.className', element).each...
[15:59:58] <thesisb> hmm
[16:00:24] <thesisb> thanks for the tip
[16:00:58] <doug65536> thesisb: it ends up doing the .find anyway, so it's more of a style thing. it can be very useful for when you are working with a document fragment - not having to .find over and over
[16:02:28] <doug65536> thesisb: for example: var row = rowTemplate.clone(); $('input[name=age]', row).val(37); something.append(row); ...etc...
[16:02:57] <thesisb> ah that is helpful
[16:10:16] <HarryPitfall> I've ported the underscore template for these tasks... to have a complex html with variables :3
[16:16:09] <saimon69> hello, got an example from a site for a search that shows/hide elements according to keywords in the rel attribute; am trying to make it work with a search field and with partial matches, but seems not to work properly
[16:16:29] <saimon69> a fiddle for it is here: http://jsfiddle.net/XAFeg/
[16:17:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How do you remove a css class that starts with a certain name?
[16:17:52] <saimon69> how can i fix it so that searching in example 'tom' or 'tomas' returns me just one list on, since is the only one with that tag, while 'cs' or 'css' returns me just the two or so on
[16:18:15] <saimon69> used the selector ^= not sure i used it good
[16:19:44] <saimon69> ecky--ptang-zoob: do this helps you? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1368591/jquery-partial-selectors
[16:20:29] <ecky--ptang-zoob> no
[16:20:29] <ecky--ptang-zoob> :(
[16:21:11] <saimon69> ecky--ptang-zoob: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[16:21:17] <saimon69> this use starts with
[16:21:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but I have multiple classes :(
[16:22:26] <saimon69> hmm then you are in a similar condition has mine, but am using rel attributes
[16:26:13] <tracker1> ecky--ptang-zoob, what are you trying to do?
[16:27:01] <tracker1> ecky--ptang-zoob, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1227286/get-class-list-for-element-with-jquery

[16:29:42] <saimon69> not working too good so am assuming am using the wrong operator
[16:30:19] <tracker1> saimon69, to a css class/
[16:30:20] <tracker1> ?
[16:30:47] <saimon69> tracker1: http://jsfiddle.net/XAFeg/
[16:30:59] <saimon69> tracker1: filtering visibility according to a rel tag
[16:32:02] <saimon69> is not working good because, in example, have only one list element with rel= tomas and instead is showing me four
[16:32:41] <saimon69> am also tryng to do some partial match so that to, tom, toma should still show the one with rel = tomas
[16:37:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I need a selector to select all siblings of a row with ID "xxx" - and the siblings should have a certain class
[16:37:23] <ecky--ptang-zoob> can anyone help?
[16:38:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> $("#datatable tr#xxx_" + tid + " > tr.part")
[16:38:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but > is children i suppose?
[16:38:33] <jphase> ecky--ptang-zoob:  try $('tr#xxx ~ tr.part')
[16:38:41] <aMoniker> Is there a clever way to set an !important using $.fn.css() ?
[16:38:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> :o
[16:39:09] <tw2113> aMoniker, doesn't .css() apply inline already
[16:39:18] <aMoniker> tw2113: Inline !== important
[16:39:22] <tw2113> i know
[16:39:39] <tw2113> but apparently you have an asshole somewhere else that insists their styles are more important
[16:39:57] <aMoniker> tw2113: No, I insist that my styles are important and wish to mark them as such.
[16:40:08] <tw2113> inline is already pretty important
[16:40:22] <aMoniker> tw2113: Do you have an answer or not?
[16:40:51] <tw2113> maybe i do, maybe i don't
[16:40:59] <tw2113> think i'll stop talking anyway?
[16:40:59] <aMoniker> It sounds like you don't.
[16:42:39] <aMoniker> Does anyone else know a decent way to apply !important using $.fn.css() ?
[16:42:53] <aMoniker> I'd rather avoid doing cssText regex replacements...
[16:43:33] <saimon69> is $('.item li:not[rel*='+thisItem+']') selecting all items that are left out from $('.item li[rel*='+thisItem+']') ?
[16:44:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> jphase, it's not working: whats wrong witht his: $("#datatable tr#task_" + taskid + " ~ tr.part").each(function(){});
[16:44:43] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ?
[16:45:52] <jphase> ecky--ptang-zoob: nothing that I can tell really, that's grabbing all siblings that are tr.part of tr#task_ID inside #datatable
[16:45:53] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh nvm, it works, thx
[16:45:58] <jphase> I'd have to see the markup
[16:46:00] <jphase> oh, cool :)
[16:46:07] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I forgot a capital letter
[16:46:22] <tw2113> aMoniker, http://jsbin.com/UdIjIcI/1/edit
[16:46:44] <aMoniker> tw2113: That replaces all inline styles.
[16:47:13] <tw2113> so add the rest?
[16:47:26] <talntid> die, freenode, die!
[16:47:30] <jphase> hmm, split pea soup!
[16:47:56] <aMoniker> tw2113: Then what happens when I need to update the same property?
[16:48:07] <aMoniker> tw2113: I'd like to avoid regex replacement.
[16:48:59] <tw2113> re-select and re-apply the new styles you need to change?
[16:49:33] <aMoniker> i.e. regex replace
[16:49:47] <tw2113> re-open the jsbin i pasted
[16:49:57] <tw2113> unless you mean regex behind the scenes
[16:50:02] <tw2113> and not typed out by you alone
[16:50:32] <aMoniker> I mean, the inline styles are arbitrary. I'm not defining them.
[16:50:45] <tw2113> $('#red').css('cssText', 'color: blue !important; border: solid red 1px;');
[16:50:45] <tw2113> $('#red').css('border-color', 'green');
[16:50:51] <aMoniker> So I'd have to add the important style to them, then search and replace for it every time I wanted to update it.
[16:50:53] <tw2113> gave me a green border in jsbin
[16:51:04] <aMoniker> Now replace the color: blue;
[16:52:02] <tw2113> *shrug* my 3rd selector isn't working
[16:52:15] <tw2113> granted i think it's bad css, jQuery applied or not, to be using important inline
[16:52:39] <aMoniker> I don't care what you think.
[16:52:41] <tw2113> and all my googling is saying use cssText if you want !important
[16:53:25] <aMoniker> which requires regex replacement
[16:54:12] <tw2113> or a different solution
[16:56:40] <aMoniker> tw2113: http://help.dottoro.com/ljdpsdnb.php
[16:57:13] <tw2113> looks like javascript, yes
[16:57:17] <tw2113> but it's not specific to jquery
[16:57:27] <tw2113> </picky>
[16:57:33] <aMoniker> tw2113: It's a better solution too.
[16:57:42] <tw2113> then run with it
[16:57:47] <tw2113> have at it! you can do it!
[16:58:00] <aMoniker> I will.
[17:21:36] <ecky--ptang-zoob> With the "keyup" event, is there a way to delay action taken? Like send a serverrequest only after 3 seconds when the user stopped typinh?
[17:21:58] <jphase> setTimeout ?
[17:22:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> tx
[17:22:31] <jphase> np
[17:23:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> actually that just does a timeout each time keyup is triggered
[17:24:20] <jphase> yeah you can use it to trigger things after a certain amount of time though
[17:24:24] <jphase> let me pull up an example
[17:24:32] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oki
[17:25:33] <jphase> so granted, this is stolen from an outdated client site I did, but it serves the purpose: http://pastebin.ws/24i1f5
[17:26:24] <jphase> in this case I'm waiting 1000 ms before checking to see if the length of what they typed is >= 3 chars and then I call some functions
[17:26:49] <jphase> the key is to use clearTimeout when the conditional fails
[17:27:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> that helps alot, thx :)
[17:27:16] <jphase> np
[17:50:07] <jphase> hmm, not sure if I like Chrome's new splash page. Seems pointless to have the search box there when the address bar is a Google search :\
[17:50:31] <jphase> the frequently visited thumbnails are much more adorable though...
[17:50:32] <jphase> </rant>
[18:03:44] <ctorp> Is there a way to identify a child div's text and place it in a new child span of the same parent in one line? I was trying something like $('.thing').find('.child').append('<span />').find('span').text($(this).find('.child').text())
[18:03:47] <ctorp> but it did not work
[18:05:36] <jphase> ctorp: try $('<span>').text($('div.child').text()).appendTo($('div.child').parent());
[18:05:59] <jphase> (changing your classes to match and such of course)
[18:06:07] <ctorp> I'll give that a shot
[18:17:51] <jphase> Oh c'mon Oregon!!! This weather is B.S.!
[18:21:02] <jphase> T13|needsCoffee: Do you work @ wikimedia? My best bud works there
[18:27:30] <T13|sleeps> I don't.  Just a Wikimedian.
[18:28:08] <jphase> ahh gotcha
[18:30:54] <rigel> ok, i am done with this project for the moment. i suppose i should push it to github huh
[18:31:11] <kiba> rigel: What project.
[18:31:51] <rigel> this crap i been working on. xml based question banks rendered to js/html for self-test purposes using cherrypy
[18:32:05] <kiba> Ah.
[18:32:15] <rigel> obvs i cant share the question banks but i can share the code i put together simple as it is
[18:32:24] * kiba is working a javascript library that allows people to turn any website into a command line app on the web.
[18:32:46] <kiba> It's a cool project.
[18:32:57] <rigel> i got in way over my head with templating languages and crap. but once i just decided to use straight xslt to transform the XML to html, it became a lot simpler
[18:38:20] <jphase> rigel: w00t, grats
[18:39:51] <jphase> xml ftl
[18:39:53] <jphase> hehe
[18:41:05] <JAAulde> I have a fullCalendar setup for which I assign the events property to be a function. At load, when some other data becomes available, I call addEventSource to add that new data. This works great. However, after the first time I navigate the calendar to another month, if I try to use addEventSource again, nothing is added to the calendar. Any thoughts? Anyone experienced something like this before? Thanks!
[18:42:23] <rigel> jphase: yeah, thanks for your help. really appreciate it
[18:42:23] <jphase> JAAulde: You could bind to their next/prev buttons maybe? Some of this depends on fullCalendar's API. I haven't used it in 2 years or so
[18:42:44] <jphase> anytime man, us Oregon vim dorks need to support each other
[18:43:23] <JAAulde> jphase: yeah, i considered binding to their buttons. I was really hoping for some generally seamless interaction with their API. thanks for the thought.
[18:44:23] <jphase> JAAulde: yeah, I'd dig into their docs. I haven't every used a custom data source with it before, only hooked it into Google Cal and stuff :\  Wish I could be more help
[18:44:30] <jphase> *of more help*
[18:46:17] <jphase> there's probably an event for it somewhere. Tried refetchEvents yet to see when that triggers?
[18:46:18] <JAAulde> jphase: I've had a lot of good experiences working with fullCalendar before, and am pretty intimate with their docs. I have Backbone in the mix here and while I have debugged far enough in to know Backbone is not the issue, I must be doing something just odd enough that I'm getting the calendar into an odd state. Either that or I'm on the trail of a fC bug.
[18:46:21] <JAAulde> Thanks again!
[18:46:33] <jphase> hmm
[18:46:56] <jphase> I mean if you're intimate with their events and such it might be a job for extending their fullCalendar object :\
[18:47:05] <jphase> which is totally gnarly
[18:47:30] <jphase> but would be less ghetto than binding events to their buttons hehe
[18:47:32] <JAAulde> heh, yeah. i need to just put some breakpoints in their source and see what I can come up with
[18:47:53] <jphase> your fullCalendar knowledge > mine    :[
[19:25:38] <jphase> w00p w00p
[20:01:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyone have any idea about the various browser and browser versions that support display: [table,table-row,table-cell]
[20:04:19] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: totally not a question for #jquery but here ya go:   http://caniuse.com/css-table
[20:04:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya i know sry ...though alot of jquery people are knowledgeable of other stuff (like you :)

[20:33:07] <amagee> is it just me or does $.ajax completely break when you try to send it a json request with a parameter called "password" in it?
[20:33:13] <amagee> if i do: $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "/login", contentType: "application/json", data: JSON.stringify({ email: "hello", "password": "fail" }) })
[20:33:28] <amagee> it doesn't even make a request to /login, it makes a request to /
[20:33:49] <amagee> change "password" to "passwordz" or anything else and it works correctly
[20:38:24] <jphase> amagee: by breaks, what do you mean exactly?
[20:38:44] <amagee> as i said, it doesn't even make a request to /login
[20:39:04] <amagee> it makes a request to /
[20:39:04] <jphase> so no activity in the network tab?
[20:39:08] <jphase> oh
[20:39:14] <jphase> sorry, missed that line
[20:39:26] <amagee> i can only assume there's some special case for "password" somewhere
[20:39:31] <shoky> amagee: works for me
[20:39:34] <jphase> amagee: where are you posting to?
[20:39:40] <jphase> There's no problem using password as POST key, generally speaking
[20:40:07] <amagee> jphase: this isn't a POST key, it's a JSON body
[20:40:09] <shoky> amagee: maybe your backend is expecting /login/ (not /login) and is redirecting you
[20:40:20] <kiba> https://scontent-b-sea.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/1229888_10153297746110131_795655970_n.jpg
[20:40:30] <jphase> well, either way, should be fine
[20:40:31] <kiba> THIS. IS. SPACEX!
[20:40:35] <kiba> Whoops
[20:40:37] <kiba> wrong channel.
[20:41:01] <amagee> ok let me check if that's the case
[20:41:16] <shoky> amagee: work fine here  http://jsfiddle.net/nBpDP/    though you can see jsfiddle is redirecting it
[20:41:30] <amagee> ohh actually yeah a redirect would make sense
[20:41:34] <doug65536> um. can someone help me, I'm lost in space here
[20:42:18] <amagee> ok yeah you're right, sorry about that, disregard the question haha

[20:43:23] <jphase> all the : look expected to me
[20:43:30] <doug65536> that's what I thought
[20:43:34] <amagee> doug65536: you might have a mistake on a previous line?
[20:45:03] <doug65536> amagee: thanks. it was a missing semicolon
[20:45:27] <doug65536> way earlier. error was on a parameter to a function call on the line after the missing semicolon. pretty weird
[20:47:47] <amagee> yeah, it happens

[20:55:55] <BillCriswell> raj: That's right. It just wouldn't be posted when it's submitted.
[20:57:15] <raj> I'm manually submitting crap using ajax
[20:57:24] <raj> BillCriswell, so why is it saying "on"?
[20:57:34] <raj> so it's not a real html submission
[20:57:44] <BillCriswell> raj: That's the default value if one isn't supplied.
[20:57:58] <raj> oh, I see
[20:58:01] <raj> interesting
[20:58:02] <raj> thank you
[20:58:41] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[20:58:55] <BillCriswell> raj: If you put value="Whatever" it would be that instead of "on"
[20:59:21] <raj> gotcha
[21:09:35] <shoky> on is the default value? had no idea
[21:10:17] <BillCriswell> shoky: That's impossible. You know everything more than me.
[21:11:20] <shoky> i know you're wrong about that, so yes. er, no. hm
[21:12:14] <BillCriswell> shoky: I think I understand
[21:13:00] <shoky> i am glad, that should help further communication
[21:13:28] <BillCriswell> I understand, and I concur.
[21:13:39] <shoky> look what you've done, raj
[21:13:51] <BillCriswell> I love ,s.
[21:13:53] <guideX> happen to know how to invoke the jquery chosen menu, the function is AbstractChosen.prototype.choices_click(evt) {
[21:14:27] <guideX> when I try, it says choices_click is not defined
[21:18:25] <raj> lol, glad to help shoky
[21:19:05] <raj> what's the most concise way to write `if (($input.attr('type') === 'radio') || ($input.attr('type') === 'checkbox')) {`
[21:20:00] <shoky> if ($input.is(':radio,:checkbox')) {
[21:20:39] <raj> got anything else for me? :)
[21:20:53] <shoky> wat, not concise enough?
[21:20:58] <raj> no, very concise
[21:21:07] <shoky> then why anything else ;p
[21:21:07] <raj> just don't like the :checkbox :radio syntax
[21:21:28] <raj> I like keeping it consistent
[21:21:36] <raj> ...and since I never use that syntax...
[21:21:40] <shoky> if ($input.is('[type=radio],[type=checkbox]'))
[21:22:08] <raj> well, in that case, I'll use the :checkbox syntax
[21:22:11] <shoky> ;p
[21:22:20] <raj> I was wondering if there was a JS way to make that if statement more consolidated
[21:22:40] <shoky> there is but it's less readable so i'd just use .is
[21:23:08] <raj> I see
[21:23:18] <raj> for edumacational purposes, what's the JS way?
[21:23:18] <shoky> if (['radio','checkbox'].indexOf( $input.attr('type') ) > -1)
[21:23:26] <raj> oh, gross
[21:23:32] <raj> .is it is
[21:23:45] <shoky> (y)
[21:24:01] <raj> no emoticons here
[21:24:08] <shoky> here neither ;p
[21:24:12] <raj> haha
[21:25:53] <raj> thanks
[21:26:47] <shoky> yessir
[21:27:43] <idiocrash> jquery channel, yes?
[21:28:21] <shoky> what's making you doubt it
[21:28:58] <idiocrash> so I have my first ajax project
[21:29:11] <idiocrash> I have a list of item IDs that I want to make hyperlinkable
[21:29:27] <idiocrash> and pass the hyperlinked ID to a PHP script to get the record details
[21:29:50] <idiocrash> so I guess first thing is, how do I make my hyperlinks clickable in a way that sends the ID to my ajax request handler?
[21:29:57] <idiocrash> I have jquery 1.4
[21:30:41] <idiocrash> and I am new to jquery
[21:30:47] <idiocrash> but not completely dense :)
[21:35:47] <raj> idiocrash, how familiar are you with html?
[21:36:02] <idiocrash> decent. I grok the most used elements
[21:37:08] <raj> one of them is an <a>
[21:37:14] <raj> that's "hyperlinkable"
[21:37:17] <BillCriswell> guideX: https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen/issues/164 any luck with this approach?
[21:37:17] <b-ot> BillCriswell: Issue #164 by josscrowcroft (25mon 2w ago): Programmatically open Chosen select options dropdown
[21:39:52] <guideX> let me check thanks
[21:40:09] <guideX> oh cool
[21:40:13] <guideX> that will probably work nicely
[21:41:36] <BillCriswell> I'd typically try it out but I'm a whole new level of lazy tonight.
[21:42:08] <jphase> idiocrash: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/j8uUz/1/  -  sloppy quick example with a .post
[21:42:09] <guideX> basically someone wants the dropdown and items selected to be in two different spots
[21:42:35] <idiocrash> oh nice!
[21:42:39] <idiocrash> jphase: thank you!
[21:42:53] <jphase> np
[21:44:20] <BillCriswell> guideX: Hopefully that's not as odd as it sounds. :)
[21:45:04] <guideX> I'm starting to consider select2, it seems way better
[21:45:47] <guideX> but yeah it is kind of od
[21:46:19] <BillCriswell> guideX: I haven't used either much to be honest. They look useful though.
[21:47:30] <guideX> they really wow the user
[21:47:46] <guideX> for some reason a multiselect listbox is amazing if it has a close button :P
[21:47:52] <guideX> .. on each item
[21:49:05] <BillCriswell> select2 seems better documented.
[21:54:37] <jphase> man, I wish I was patient enough to refresh myself on trigonometric functions and do some d3 or raphael fanciness
[22:03:50] <idiocrash> thanks for the pointers, guise!
[22:05:22] <BillCriswell> jphase: Yeah. I'm tempted to take an online math class or something.
[22:05:56] <jphase> I went to integral calc and loved every minute of it but that was a decade ago :[
[22:06:26] <jphase> probably couldn't do a trig proof to save my life
[22:07:19] <BillCriswell> jphase: I'm only high school educated and I definitely wasn't in the advanced classes. Luckily I just need to be logical for most of the tasks I have to accomplish.
[22:07:52] <jphase> well I suppose everything is a tutorial away hehe
[22:08:24] <BillCriswell> jphase: The internet is amazing.
[22:08:36] <jphase> webernets++;
[22:18:29] <BillCriswell> Indeed!
[22:24:36] <BillCriswell> Night!
[22:36:34] <thun_> If I have a input that fires on blur how do I get the parent form? This is not working http://pastebin.com/W7mSQWWL
[22:59:58] <jphase> thun_:  you shouldn't be using $(event) there
[23:00:11] <jphase> $(this) should suffice
[23:00:43] <thun_> I tried this. It was inside a form. It was the td nesting messing it up. I have finally gotten to the parent form object. Now having trouble accessing children inputs.
[23:00:45] <jphase> $(this) = $('#blah') in thais case
[23:00:56] <jphase> hmm
[23:01:16] <thun_> $(this).closest('td').siblings(":first").first('form');
[23:01:29] <thun_> That works and I can get form id
[23:02:01] <thun_> how would I access an input element of the form class blah? <input type='text' class='blah'>
[23:02:29] <jphase> $('form input.blah')
[23:02:42] <jphase> or did you mean the form had a class of blah?
[23:03:23] <raj> don't drop that thun_ thun_
[23:04:05] <thun_> Don't drop me
[23:04:15] <thun_> no the input has class blah
[23:04:19] <thun_> but it's not working
[23:04:27] <thun_> does td break form siblings?
[23:04:44] <jphase> nah
[23:04:59] <jphase> form siblings are elements next to the form element though
[23:05:07] <thun_> 	$(this).closest('td').siblings(":first").first('form input.red_10game').val()
[23:05:10] <jphase> like <form></form><div></div><span></span>
[23:05:32] <thun_> <td><form><td><input><td><input>
[23:05:49] <jphase> what is $(this) ?
[23:06:08] <thun_> called on blur of input field from the form
[23:06:08] <jphase> the input you're blurring on ?
[23:06:11] <thun_> yes
[23:06:11] <jphase> k
[23:06:21] <jphase> can you pastebin your markup?
[23:06:32] <jphase> so hard to help without seeing exactly what your html looks like
[23:08:58] <thun_> http://pastebin.com/wzpttypm
[23:09:10] <thun_> There is like 10 of those tr's
[23:09:14] <thun_> different data
[23:09:46] <jphase> whoa, thank goodness for tidy
[23:10:09] <thun_> Lol it's dynamically generated
[23:10:18] <thun_> Had to copy paste from view source
[23:10:37] <jphase> hehe, not all your fault either
[23:10:43] <jphase> pastebin.com kinda poops on things too
[23:11:27] <jphase> so couple things...
[23:12:20] <jphase> $(this).closest('td').siblings(":first")   could be changed to   $(this).closest('tr > td:first')
[23:12:25] <jphase> which may start to help things out a bit
[23:12:42] <jphase> the .first is the issue here it looks like though
[23:13:13] <jphase> so you just want to search for red_10game in all the tds?
[23:13:57] <jphase> I think anyhow
[23:14:25] <jphase> try this instead:
[23:14:25] <jphase> $(this).closest('tr').find('input.red_10game').val();
[23:14:50] <thun_> yes but red_10game exists in other tr rows
[23:14:55] <jphase> oh
[23:15:01] <thun_> just want the one in this form
[23:15:07] <jphase> oh okay
[23:15:19] <jphase> $(this).closest('form').find('input.red_10game').val();
[23:15:53] <jphase> ohhhhhh I see
[23:16:00] <jphase> your form is inside the td before
[23:16:05] <jphase> yes, tds are messing with this in this case
[23:16:08] <thun_> Yes
[23:16:10] <jphase> you'd have to do something like...
[23:16:25] <thun_> I can move form somewhere that works better
[23:16:31] <thun_> but closest(form) is not working
[23:16:49] <jphase> closest only finds siblings and parents
[23:16:57] <jphase> it will skip right over that previous td
[23:17:09] <thun_> Ok that explains it
[23:17:31] <jphase> $(this).closest('td').siblings().find('form input.red_10game').val();
[23:17:37] <jphase> (in your current case)
[23:17:49] <jphase> or you could move your form around to be more accommodating
[23:18:21] <Cork> jphase: the siblings isn't needed
[23:18:41] <jphase> hmmm, you sure?
[23:18:44] <Cork> yes
[23:18:53] <Cork> find looks in the child tree of the parent
[23:19:01] <Cork> so siblings is pointless there
[23:19:15] <thun_> Well it finds the form
[23:19:21] <thun_> but does not find the input.red_10game
[23:19:27] <thun_> same sibling issue going the other way?
[23:19:30] <Cork> sure, it's just an extra process step
[23:19:45] <jphase> Cork:  you should check the markup though, but yeah it should probably be closest('tr').find() instead though
[23:19:52] <jphase> or something
[23:19:58] <Cork> ya
[23:20:33] <Cork> uh <td><form><td><input><td><input>?
[23:20:33] <thun_> In this case, the sibblings is required
[23:20:41] <jphase> thun_: grab the closest('tr') instead
[23:20:42] <Cork> i guess you skip a few elements there?
[23:20:43] <thun_> Yes is that really bad?
[23:20:51] <jphase> Cork is right
[23:20:53] <Cork> it's invalid
[23:21:12] <ses1984> i had a question about url encoding, i'm trying to pass a json object with one kv pair, the v is an array. the resulting url looks like:
[23:21:29] <ses1984> /process_filter_update/?pks%5B%5D=784&pks%5B%5D=188 ... is that how it's supposed to look
[23:21:41] <jphase> Cork: his markup looks like this http://pastebin.ws/4k7mnu
[23:21:51] <Cork> uh <td><form><table><tbody><tr><td><input></td><td><input></td></tr></tbody></table></form></td> would be ok
[23:22:10] <Cork> ah
[23:22:13] <Cork> ya, that's fine
[23:22:45] <thun_> Well there it is
[23:22:50] <thun_> I close the form in the first td
[23:22:54] <thun_> wierd ok 1 sec
[23:23:20] <Cork> ah
[23:23:23] <Cork> sorry no
[23:23:37] <Cork> the input fields would need a form="form-id" if they are located outside the form
[23:23:56] <Cork> thun_: you should prob move the form tag outside the <table>
[23:24:12] <Cork> (would be the cleanest way to do it)
[23:24:46] <Cork> the markup is still valid though
[23:24:47] <thun_> Cork I have several tr rows each a form
[23:24:53] <jphase> thun_: I'd put your form around your table unless you need it based on each row or something
[23:24:58] <Cork> just won't work very well
[23:25:07] <thun_> yes each tr is a seperate form
[23:25:16] <Cork> thun_: not possible
[23:25:20] <thun_> Divs?
[23:25:24] <Cork> each td can be a form
[23:25:27] <Cork> or each table
[23:25:30] <Cork> not each tr
[23:25:37] <jphase> otherwise invalid markup
[23:25:44] <thun_> Ok... will play with it
[23:25:45] <Cork> the form will be moved
[23:25:59] <thun_> Yes it is auto-correcting it
[23:26:06] <Cork> thun_: also don't use tables for layout
[23:26:42] <jphase> thun_: another option is to make the forms live independently of your table structure... like all the forms by themselves outside the tables. Then you relate your <tr> with your <form> with some attribute or something
[23:26:43] <Cork> you can achieve the same effect through css
[23:26:57] <jphase> <tr rel="1"> and <form rel="1"> or something
[23:27:06] <Woosta> how do I emulate a click() on a buttonset?  Calling .click() on the radiobutton calls the click handler, but doesn't update the look of the buttons
[23:27:17] <Cork> jqlog: rel isn't connecting form content
[23:27:46] <Cork> ses1984: yes it is
[23:28:07] <Cork> Woosta: trigger('change') should work
[23:28:15] <junetellain626> anyone kind enough to help a jquery rookie? here's my code http://pastebin.com/J0CQn2fK. what happens is that upon first click of the submit button, it reloads. the second click on the submit button will show the message. I want that I should only click the button once for the message to appear. Thanks!
[23:28:19] <jphase> I just meant for the sake of selecting the form that he wants
[23:28:45] <jphase> ohh right but his inputs are in various tds down the page, right
[23:28:51] <jphase> nvm
[23:29:01] <Woosta> Cork: on which object? The radio or the container?
[23:29:17] <Cork> Woosta: the input element you want to change to
[23:29:30] <Cork> though click should work too
[23:30:30] <Cork> junetellain626: firstly frm. not $(frm) frm is already a jquery object
[23:30:56] <Cork> junetellain626: secondly frm.serialize() instead of the selector again :)
[23:31:22] <Cork> junetellain626: thirdly have the server send the correct mimetype and you won't need line 12
[23:31:56] <Cork> junetellain626: actually you parse it to obj but you never use it...
[23:32:36] <Cork> junetellain626: btw what message are you talking about?
[23:32:45] <Cork> the alert in success?
[23:35:52] <tobago> what is the best input mask JS based on jQuery?
[23:36:57] <jphase> tobago: I can't speak for the "best" per sé but I use http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/
[23:37:50] <jphase> it's simple and for things it doesn't support natively it allows you to define your own using regex
[23:39:09] <junetellain626> Cork: thanks for the inputs. really need to tidy things up.:) right now it looks like this -> http://www.dev4.icambridge.com/ . it will ask you to enter a valid zip code. but the message appears on the second click of the submit button.  (you could try 00000) :)
[23:40:19] <Cork> junetellain626: where are the js for this?
[23:41:13] <Cork> found it
[23:43:09] <tobago> jphase, I checked that one too, but didn't like that I can insert a date like 99/99/9999.
[23:43:43] <jphase> hmm, you should be able to... that's the first example on their site
[23:44:02] <tobago> jphase, I want to make that one running: http://keith-wood.name/datetimeEntryBasics.html
[23:44:05] <jphase> is there an issue or error or something?
[23:44:26] <tobago> jphase, why should I be able to insert such a date?
[23:44:27] <jphase> hmm, this one is a different library
[23:44:40] <jphase> ohhhh
[23:44:45] <jphase> you're misunderstanding their mask
[23:44:48] <tobago> jphase, it's based on  jQuery too.
[23:44:50] <jphase> 99/99/9999 just means digits
[23:44:54] <jphase> 9 doesn't actually mean 9
[23:44:58] <jphase> just represents a number
[23:45:01] <jphase> up to 9
[23:45:07] <jphase> or something like that
[23:45:29] <tobago> jphase, no. the label is "Date"
[23:45:49] <tobago> and such Date is odd.
[23:46:02] <jphase> one of us is confused
[23:46:11] <tobago> jphase, maybe I am?
[23:46:37] <jphase> $("#date").mask("99/99/9999");  is an example saying any number
[23:46:37] <tobago> jphase, I want to implement a help for the user to insert dates.
[23:46:51] <junetellain626> Cork: sorry,took a while to come back. name is gentleg_custom.js. could the problem be with the jquery code? or could it be with the function calling it?
[23:46:55] <jphase> $("#date").mask("39/12/9999"); for example
[23:47:00] <jphase> would be a more accurate date mask
[23:47:10] <jphase> cause then they can start with a number > 3
[23:47:11] <jphase> etc.
[23:47:26] <Cork> junetellain626: $('#gentleg-get-zip-form') doesn't match the form the first time, so submit is never added as a listener
[23:47:37] <Cork> junetellain626: after a post the js connects and you get the message
[23:47:40] <jphase> tobago: the number inside the mask is the highest number the user can input in that position
[23:47:55] <jphase> .mask('3') = user can enter 1 through 3
[23:48:06] <jphase> or 0 through 3 rather
[23:48:11] <tobago> jphase, ahh. got it. the demo isn't very much intuitive...
[23:48:15] <jphase> it's not
[23:48:24] <Cork> junetellain626: ya, the id is 'gentleg-get-zip-form--2' at first
[23:48:33] <tobago> jphase, but well. yeah that would fit to my needs.
[23:48:55] <jphase> tobago:  yeah, just read the three bullet points at the very top of the page
[23:55:55] <junetellain626> Cork: ahhhh, i see. didn't notice that one. :) drupal module and associated js was made by prev developer you see (plus im no good at js. lol). Thanks a bunch kind sir!!
[23:56:18] <Cork> np
