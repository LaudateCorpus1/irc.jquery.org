[04:19:56] <Woet> bravvve22: wat.
[04:20:12] <pavonia> ^
[04:20:21] <Woet> you can't just put a bunch of web development words in a sentence and expect it to make sense
[05:05:38] <bravvve22> ok Woet, www.chtaybou.com
[05:10:17] <bravvve>  /msg NickServ identify Djezzy22
[05:10:21] <Woet> nice
[05:10:21] <bravvve> ops
[05:10:22] <Woet> strong password
[05:10:27] <Woet> nice and random
[05:10:29] <bravvve> hhhhhhhh
[05:10:44] <Woet> bravvve22 / bravvve: why did you link me that garbage spam site?
[05:17:46] <bravvve> not spam site
[05:21:45] <Woet> then why the 20 redirects and iframes to http://5.196.189.80/Chtaybou-1.0/?
[05:25:16] <bravvve> two domain names one to another
[05:25:37] <bravvve> try http://chtaybou.fennec.online
[05:28:53] <Woet> yea, which redirects to http://chtaybou.fennec.online/NXbLZ/, which redirects to http://chtaybou.fennec.online/, which redirects to /NmlZZ/, which redirects to /WnXfZ/NmlZZ/, which redirects to /UdOaZ/WnXfZ/NmlZZ/, etc. etc.
[05:29:43] <Woet> why all the redirects? why the iframes?
[05:30:35] <Woet> which ends up on some hideous site with amazon ads
[05:30:43] <bravvve> well maby its godaddy isu ,i'v configured just  redirections
[05:34:02] <Woet> hire someone to set up your website properly
[05:34:20] <Woet> and why does that site need adsense?
[05:34:26] <Woet> it has no useful content
[05:35:33] <bravvve> hhhhhhhh,maby not for u, but its some caind of alibaba
[05:36:49] <Woet> theres 14 products..
[05:36:51] <Woet> all by the same guy..
[05:36:54] <Woet> lmao
[05:38:10] <bravvve> no when scroll down it give older
[05:43:57] <bravvve> Woet: any idea about iframe
[05:46:22] <Woet> bravvve: stop using iframes. stop using redirects. improve your site before putting ads on it.
[05:46:31] <Woet> bravvve: and none of this is remotely related to jquery.
[12:25:49] <robertparkerx> I am trying to replace all "ca" with blank but it only replaces one -- .replace
[12:25:50] <robertparkerx> http://jsfiddle.net/xeaquzco/1/
[12:29:35] <robertparkerx>  .replace(/ca/g, "") worked
[12:30:54] <robertparkerx> http://jsfiddle.net/xeaquzco/2/
[13:33:42] <jak2000> happy new year
[15:58:38] <Kalov> hi, i have a bunch of divs with .classtype, i want to do a .each for one to set an event, can that be done just using the class name?
[15:59:04] <Kalov> will the event be independent in each one?
[15:59:42] <Kalov> i've done it in the past by linking an event to an unique id on a class type
[15:59:52] <Kalov> but i was wondering if it could be done without ids
[17:45:22] <robertmaxrees> Kalov that sounds kind of roundabout.
[17:45:28] <robertmaxrees> why do you need the .each()?
[17:52:28] <Kalov> already worked it out
[17:52:45] <robertmaxrees> alright :)
[17:52:54] <Kalov> yeah im kinda new to jquery
[17:53:03] <Kalov> i bet i been doing things the wrong way all the time
[17:53:09] <Kalov> but i'm getter betting at it
[17:53:58] <robertmaxrees> \:)
[17:54:08] <robertmaxrees> why did you think you need an each and unique IDs btw?
[17:55:17] <Kalov> because that's how i did it in another view
[17:55:32] <robertmaxrees> just fyi you don't need .each() when using .on()
[17:55:37] <robertmaxrees> it does that part for you.
