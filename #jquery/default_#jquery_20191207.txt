[09:19:24] <Nach0z> Kristjan1291983: do you have firefox or chrome?
[09:19:39] <Kristjan1291983> chrome
[09:21:05] <Nach0z> there's an extension called Pesticide for Chrome that lets you outline all block-level elements

[09:50:30] <bestdesign> hi
[09:50:36] <bestdesign> anyone good with regexp?
[10:45:22] <pavonia> That's a meta question, and also one asked in the wrong channel :p
[11:34:37] <bestdesign> pavonia: you know official regexp channel :D?
[11:39:17] <pavonia> There's #regexp, but your chances are probably higher in ##programming
[21:07:12] <brobert> hi
[21:07:59] <brobert> ive been using $(...).change(   to add event handlers with jquery... but sometimes I want to update them/replace them
[21:08:35] <brobert> I noticed that if I call .change(...)  on the same elements again... it just "adds" the handler not replaces them
[21:09:13] <brobert> can I keep track/replace them ?
[21:18:45] <pavonia> You can unbind them using .off() and add a new one
[21:23:59] <brobert> pavonia, wow ok see that now
[21:24:18] <brobert> pavonia, also I see that if I define a handler function... that in itself sorts it out
[21:24:24] <brobert> it wont be added twice
[21:24:28] <brobert> thats cool
[21:24:39] <brobert> should I just trust that or add .off for safety?
[21:26:14] <pavonia> Depends on what you are trying to do
[21:26:35] <brobert> on change using .change(...)
[21:27:08] <brobert> I just noticed that if I pass a function instead of inline =>  I dont get this problem of repeatedly calling the same thing
[21:27:29] <brobert> so jquery must replace .change(...) calls to same function
[21:27:39] <brobert> at least the latest version does so
[21:28:39] <brobert> pavonia, sorry I mean ... if I pass a declared function... not inline function or =>
[21:29:02] <brobert> I guess because jquery then has a ref to an actual function and will update that instead of add new one
[21:31:10] <shoky> brobert: the only difference is with arrow functions =>, where the function won't get jquery's `this` context
[21:32:53] <shoky> in either case, calling .change(...) will add another event handler, not replace any
[21:37:49] <brobert> shoky, ah you are right... made a mistake in my logging
[21:37:53] <brobert> still called twice
[21:38:11] <brobert> ok so will use off beforehand
[21:40:44] <brobert> added  .off('change', myHandler); before .change(myHandler);
[21:40:46] <brobert> fixes it
[21:42:01] <brobert> shoky, I guess thats the way to go, right?
[22:02:24] <shoky> brobert: if that's what you really need to do. usually it's best to just put your logic into the handler, so that it behaves differently whenever it is that you were gonna replace the handler
