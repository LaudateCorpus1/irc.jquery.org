[01:11:15] <Jumoke> knock knock
[01:12:17] <Jumoke> I want to add an analytics event to a link so that it runs a function when clicked on. Nothing seems to be working, Not this  $("a.my-mix-report-link", context).click(function (e) {}); and not on mousedown either. The link has href that goes to another page.
[01:12:24] <Jumoke> What am i doign wrong?
[01:22:44] <Kamuela> what is 'context' in this case Jumoke
[01:30:04] <Jumoke> the parent function
[01:30:11] <Jumoke> in whihc it is contained
[01:40:34] <Kamuela> Jumoke: are you trying to stop the link from going to another page?
[01:42:03] <Jumoke> no i still want the link to fire @ kamuela
[01:42:25] <Jumoke> and i want the click event to write to db as well
[01:42:34] <Kamuela> what are you trying to do within your click callback? window.alert('test') doesn't fire?
[01:42:41] <Jumoke> yes it doesn't
[01:43:02] <Kamuela> make sure devtools doesn't clear the console on page change
[01:43:10] <Kamuela> and then see what's happening when you click the link
[01:55:14] <Kamuela> Jumoke: any news?
[01:59:52] <Jumoke> $('.profile-button a').live('click', function (e) {} this work
[02:00:14] <Jumoke> $('.profile-button a').click(function (e) {} - this doesn't work
[02:01:05] <Jumoke> Found answer here; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12219672/why-is-my-click-event-handler-not-firing-for-a-dynamically-added-link
[02:01:14] <Jumoke> thank you kamuela
[02:01:35] <Jumoke> seem like an issue with jquery version.
[02:01:36] <Jumoke> :)
[02:01:42] <Kamuela> which version are you using?
[02:07:25] <guessx> .live ends at v1.7
[02:07:34] <guessx> then you switch to .on
[02:07:54] <Jumoke> 1.4.4
[02:08:20] <Jumoke> Ok i see
[04:36:06] <WizJin> hey ppl
[04:37:22] <whirledpress> Shhhhh....everyone is watching Saturday Morning Cartoons.
[04:37:53] <whirledpress> wait, do they even have cartoons on Saturdays any more?
[04:38:27] <WizJin> they should have.. cartoons are good for humanity
[04:39:23] <whirledpress> Amen.
[04:40:19] <WizJin> whirledpress, so you know jquery
[04:41:07] <whirledpress> I know enough to get in trouble. What ya got?
[04:42:43] <WizJin> see, i know what javascript is.. what jquery is.. i followed some crash courses.. i need to wrap it up around my head pretty quick
[04:43:08] <WizJin> it lets you select DOM elements, tags, and lets you manipulate, add, update it...
[04:43:22] <whirledpress> yes...
[04:43:34] <WizJin> now the question is
[04:43:42] <WizJin> where can i use it practically in my web development projects..
[04:43:52] <WizJin> how do i use it? in what scenarios should i use it ?
[04:44:09] <whirledpress> Wherever you get sick of typing document.getElementByID("ID");
[04:44:15] <whirledpress> you can just $("#id");
[04:44:49] <WizJin> hmm
[04:44:58] <whirledpress> jquery handles a bunch of other nice things for you too. That's an over-simplification. Plus jquery is cross-platform compat
[04:45:22] <whirledpress> so no multiple conditional statements depending on the browser any more
[04:46:21] <whirledpress> and as you look through the jquery library, there are some great shortcuts to doing things that you CAN do in javascript alone, but what a pain.
[04:46:33] <whirledpress> since jquery is js and all
[04:47:31] <whirledpress> to style an element can be a real nightmare in js. But in jquery it's $("el").css({yourstyleobject});
[04:48:54] <whirledpress> jquery handles all the conditional magic in the background so you don't have to.
[04:49:15] <WizJin> hmm
[04:49:44] <WizJin> i am listening..
[04:51:11] <whirledpress> what else do you want to know. If you want me to convince you to use any library, I'm not the man to do it. It's a matter of personal preference, I suppose.
[04:52:02] <whirledpress> however, there are tons of google results for ya: http://www.javaworld.com/article/2078613/java-web-development/6-reasons-you-should-be-using-jquery.html
[04:52:47] <whirledpress> or better yet, and more to the point: http://www.learningjquery.com/2015/02/5-reasons-to-use-jquery
[05:03:39] <Uhkis> jquery does NOT work if js is disabled
[05:10:45] <whirledpress> right...
[05:13:23] <Shoarua> to be fair you can do alot already in CSS
[05:13:58] <Shoarua> for adding content on the fly jquery is nice
[05:17:58] <zumba_ad_> Anyone knows how jsonp works not in terms of making a request but when we get the response back
[05:23:48] <whirledpress> funny that one of the latest debates is whether it is a good idea to replace css with js-based inline styling.
[05:25:15] <Kamuela> whirledpress: i'm on the side of using CSS for all your base styles and resets
[05:25:21] <Kamuela> and everything inline in your front-end app after that
[05:25:46] <Kamuela> you can start with class-swapping but ultimately you want all that logic in your app
[05:27:30] <whirledpress> I am not advocating one or the other because heaven knows, I have no idea which is better. lol
[05:27:48] <whirledpress> I do hate css though.
[05:29:21] <Kamuela> whirledpress: this was shared earlier: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-41v6n3Vaf5s/UeRN_XJ0keI/AAAAAAAAN2Y/YxIHhddGiaw/s1600/css.gif
[05:30:18] <whirledpress> exactly. lol
[05:38:19] <Kamuela> but to face facts, it's because we're noobs
[05:38:50] <Kamuela> you can argue that CSS isn't logical, but if you're familiar enough with it it starts to make sense
[05:40:18] <Shoarua> CSS is pretty easy
[05:41:38] <Kamuela> when I have my own dev shop, anyone who says that will be immediately hired
[05:46:14] <shoky_> zumba_ad_: yes
[05:46:51] <zumba_ad_> shoky_: am i right that the callback function gets deleted after successful execution?
[05:48:16] <shoky_> zumba_ad_: by jquery you mean?  sure, jquery deletes its' reference to the callback, i believe
[05:49:13] <shoky_> but generally speaking about jsonp, that's not correct, only about jquery and its reference to your callback
[05:54:32] <whirledpress> https://youtu.be/EnxeKpW2zqI   Kamuela
[05:54:49] <Kamuela> whirledpress: video is private
[05:54:58] <whirledpress> dangit...lol one sec
[05:55:24] <zumba_ad_> thanks shoky_
[05:55:44] <zumba_ad_> yes, i was referring to jquery
[05:59:06] <whirledpress> https://youtu.be/EnxeKpW2zqI doesn't work?
[05:59:11] <whirledpress> it says public
[05:59:38] <zumba_ad_> another question. How can I get the type of error thrown just like how are apiPrefilter captures when it does a retry?
[06:00:48] <zumba_ad_> i need to stop retry when request is a jsonp. I noticed that multiple retries of jsonp and a timeout exceeding shows multiple Uncaught TypeError not a function
[06:02:51] <Kamuela> zumba_ad_: that does
[06:03:03] <zumba_ad_> this is what I added inside error: to prevent from js exception happening  - http://pastebin.com/5j2WUKYs
[06:03:16] <Kamuela> yep, relevant zumba_ad_
[06:03:30] <Kamuela> whoops ^ goes to whirledpress
[06:03:36] <Kamuela> both of those
[06:03:45] <Kamuela> sorry I'm getting kind of tired and I'm not sure why
[06:03:51] <zumba_ad_> Kamuela: I looked at the 3 params, it doesn't contain the value that I see in our $.ajaxPrefilter
[06:04:09] <Kamuela> zumba_ad_: sorry I didn't mean to tag you, so disregard everything i said
[06:04:18] <zumba_ad_> oh
[06:16:13] <zumba_ad_> I found the text I need it's under xhr.statusText :)
[06:49:26] <manrig> Hi guys can someone help me out with JS ? Trying to get a DDslick menu working on my wordpress site http://manolzemultimedia.com.au/ourmelbourne/
[06:56:26] <Pazician> Hello again, everyone. I'm dealing with WordPress and as probably know WP has single.php which displays the whole post, what I want now is - I want to load that single.php inside a div called .project-info and from there display everything on the index page
[07:58:13] <whirledpress> Pazician, you will need to use AJAX to do that. I'd suggest using an ajax plugin for wp
[07:58:55] <whirledpress> manrig, did you get your problem solved?
[07:59:12] <Pazician> whirledpress: I got it, I use .load() but I'm still struggling a bit - it works in responsive screen but it doesn't load the content if the screen is bigger than 800px, no idea why: http://pastebin.com/rQjw1huX
[08:03:23] <whirledpress> Pazician, there could be a million and two reasons why it isn't working. I am not sure without knowing a lot more detail. Like does ajax return and error or blank content?
[08:03:57] <Pazician> whirledpress: What's error or blank content - what do you mean with that?
[08:04:07] <whirledpress> or does it return the expected content, but doesn't show on the screen. Does it only happen after the content was loaded responsive then not
[08:04:16] <whirledpress> $)
[08:04:57] <Pazician> It loads the content in responsive mode, if the screen is loaded on the bigger screen, bigger than 800px than it will not load anything
[08:05:10] <Pazician> *then
[08:05:18] <whirledpress> See the problem seems to me that you are loading the entire html document into a div.
[08:08:05] <Pazician> I am doing it, since it's nothing else than the content, which I want
[08:10:04] <whirledpress> one sec, i'll make a fiddle
[08:10:25] <Pazician> whirledpress: Alright, thanks
[08:15:25] <whirledpress> try something along these lines to see what you are getting returned from the ajax: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/mpba51yk/
[08:16:52] <whirledpress> Now, it is also possible that you can't find .project-info the second time. Try loading it on the big screen first, then the smaller one and see if it still works the same
[08:18:34] <Pazician> whirledpress: Still the same, doesn't load the content on the bigger screen
[08:21:55] <whirledpress> do you get the error?
[08:22:43] <Pazician> No, I don't get an error
[08:22:50] <Pazician> No alert is showing up
[08:23:24] <whirledpress> and you added the code I suggested, right?
[08:23:52] <Pazician> whirledpress: Yes, copy&pasted lol
[08:24:27] <whirledpress> okay. So you are getting something back from the ajax call. what is in .project-info?
[08:25:02] <Pazician> Nothing, on the big screen, in responsive mode - I get the content just like I wanted
[08:25:21] <whirledpress> have you looked at the source?
[08:25:38] <Pazician> whirledpress: What source, do you mean inspecting the element?
[08:26:21] <whirledpress> Yeah, nothing in the .project-info div?
[08:26:42] <Pazician> No
[08:27:42] <whirledpress> I'm not sure what theme you are using. It sounds like single.php has an error that is preventing it from rendering anything at regular size
[08:28:23] <Pazician> I'm a Wordpress developer, I make my own themes - there's just an loop in single.php with the_title() and the_content() inside it
[08:28:40] <whirledpress> so then how is it responsive?
[08:29:26] <Pazician> I got my index.php that's the main thing, and then there's content sliding in which I want fetch the content in to the index from other pages
[08:30:05] <whirledpress> but what changes from responsive size to not responsive?
[08:31:13] <whirledpress> can you request the exact same content directly without ajax and get it to load in both responsive and non?
[08:31:36] <Pazician> whirledpress: Hmmm... Like remove the $.ajaxSetup...?
[08:32:01] <whirledpress> the url that you are grabbing from the href, can you manually type it in and get the page to load at both sizes?
[08:32:49] <whirledpress> because if it's not loading in your browser, ajax won't get it.
[08:32:58] <Pazician> Now I get the error alerty
[08:33:01] <Pazician> *alert
[08:33:14] <Pazician> https://jsfiddle.net/mpba51yk/1/
[08:33:43] <Pazician> Oh
[08:33:45] <whirledpress> remove lines 2 through 13
[08:33:55] <whirledpress> so when you click the link, it loads the pages
[08:34:17] <whirledpress> oh wait..
[08:34:25] <whirledpress> you don't load a link like that
[08:34:29] <Pazician> I know
[08:34:32] <Pazician> Lol
[08:34:43] <Pazician> I gotta get the ID from the post
[08:34:52] <whirledpress> you need to use the permalink to setup the query and let it choose the template single.php
[08:35:17] <Pazician> I know, and I am doing it - it works perfect in responsive mode, below 800px
[08:35:22] <whirledpress> where is ".fetch-link" being generated?
[08:35:37] <Pazician> <a href="<?php echo get_the_permalink(); ?>" class="fetch-link">
[08:36:12] <whirledpress> remove all the code in the fiddle and see if the link works normally at both sizes
[08:37:52] <Pazician> It works, but at the top, I've a e.preventDefault() can it be that's the problem?
[08:38:41] <whirledpress> at the top of what?
[08:39:25] <Pazician> The whole document that I sent you in the beginning of our conversation
[08:39:39] <whirledpress> remove line 6
[08:40:07] <Pazician> And line 10?
[08:41:17] <Pazician> I mean 12
[08:41:26] <whirledpress> can you please paste your entire html for the page in jsfiddle.
[08:41:57] <Pazician> https://jsfiddle.net/mpba51yk/2/
[08:43:24] <mintmoney> can anyone help me call a function from this plugin, i have pasted all of my client code and link to the un-minified plugin script here: http://pastie.org/10414708
[08:43:46] <mintmoney> many good vibes will come your way if anyone can help me out with this!
[08:44:29] <mintmoney>  I was thinking I could just call the plugin's open or _open method from within the ready_callback when i initialized the plugin, but its not working out
[08:45:00] <mintmoney> I'm really just trying to get the plugin to continue steps across multiple pages, and this is a kind of workaround...
[08:47:59] <Pazician> whirledpress: I'll be back in a few minutes - I gotta go back to my room and get a charger, I'm down on 5%...
[08:49:54] <whirledpress> Pazician, You are closing your article tab with the project-info section open (plus I think that's bad semantic use of sections and articles
[08:53:56] <Pazician> whirledpress: Alright, I'm back
[08:55:50] <mintmoney> anyone have any clue on how I can programmatically open up the page guide? I linked to in the pastie?
[08:56:01] <mintmoney> could really use the help :(
[09:05:04] <whirledpress> Pazician, https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/mpba51yk/4/
[09:05:37] <whirledpress> something like that. I think your html was screwed up
[09:09:23] <whirledpress> mintmoney, that is hardly all your code.
[09:10:06] <mintmoney> its in the document ready
[09:10:17] <mintmoney> then i have a ul list
[09:10:23] <mintmoney> but that doesn't effect anything
[09:11:02] <mintmoney> as i say in the comments the page guide loads fine from the default button, and I have successfully bound it to a custom element on the page, that all works fine
[09:11:24] <Pazician> whirledpress: Nothing works now
[09:12:01] <mintmoney> ill make a fiddle for you guys
[09:12:03] <whirledpress> check your html
[09:12:45] <Pazician> whirledpress: Where should I look for?
[09:18:20] <whirledpress> what is wrap-all?
[09:18:31] <whirledpress> is it supposed to wrappall the content in the loop?
[09:18:45] <whirledpress> or in each element in the loop
[09:19:08] <Pazician> It's the wrapper for the image and everythin, I do animation with it
[09:19:39] <whirledpress> so it encloses .project-info or no?
[09:21:24] <mintmoney> here's a fiddle with the plugin loaded and a super basic example in there
[09:21:26] <mintmoney> http://jsfiddle.net/4kz0mf9e/
[09:22:04] <mintmoney> i want to use a JS call to start the walkthrough (not the button/tab click...)
[09:25:38] <whirledpress> Pazician, so you have inside the loop an article element with an single div child. Then inside that div, you have the featured icon, the exceprt and the full content holder (but no content)   does that sound correct?
[09:26:37] <roxlu> hey! When I create an element with $('<div>'); and append it to a container; is there a way to remove them completely from memory?
[09:27:19] <Pazician> whirledpress: Right, in responsive mode it's like that, but all through it's working out in responsive mode, and also when it's in responsive mode it gets inside the .wrap-all and outside it'll go outside it - maybe that's where's the problem occurs - like, it's outside the .wrap-all not inside it
[09:28:02] <whirledpress> where is it doing this?
[09:29:33] <Pazician> On line 77 https://jsfiddle.net/mpba51yk/5/
[09:33:27] <whirledpress> Bunch of things
[09:33:52] <whirledpress> $('article') will give you all of the articles now. No future articles will be added to the list
[09:33:59] <Shoarua> why not doing things for smaller sizes with css?
[09:34:51] <Pazician> What you mean?
[09:35:09] <Pazician> Shoarua: Bcuz, you can't add classes and do event with CSS...
[09:35:16] <whirledpress> Shoarua ++
[09:36:56] <whirledpress> Pazician, use media-queries to set up various size parameters for your elements
[09:37:36] <Pazician> Yes, and I've done that
[09:38:07] <Shoarua> i always learned don't depend on javascript for making the website work
[09:38:24] <whirledpress> well, for one thing. $allarticles should be blank
[09:38:35] <whirledpress> or css for that matter.
[09:40:58] <Pazician> Are you telling my that the allArticles is causing the problem with not loading the content on big screen?
[09:55:48] <whirledpress> I'mn telling you that I would go about this entirely differently. I would load the page and generate the links. Then when the links were clicked, I would create (in a separate location all together) a new holder that I could load the content from that link into).
[09:56:35] <whirledpress> When you load new article elements, however, be advised that you can't get to them with $allarticles. They weren't defined when you defined $allarticles
[09:58:27] <Pazician> whirledpress: Right, I follow you on that one. How can I create elements when I load the content from single.php then?
[10:20:39] <whirledpress> Pazician, this is roughly, and I mean roughly how I would setup the php side...working on the jq side
[10:20:51] <whirledpress> https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/mpba51yk/7/
[10:21:48] <Pazician> whirledpress: This won't work localhost:8888/wp4/single.php
[10:31:45] <whirledpress> https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/mpba51yk/9/    That's the rough idea for loading your content.
[10:33:43] <whirledpress> Keep in mind this is just the way I would do it. I haven't tested it or debugged it or even had a look at what you expect the final outcome to look at, but it gives you some good snippets to digest and hopefully you can go from here. I gotta eat something.
[10:41:51] <zumba_ad_> i still can't figure out pros/cons of having a long timeout on ajax calls like 20 secs. I noticed that there are rare times we'd get the response from our api beyond 20 secs.
[10:42:47] <whirledpress> by then you customer is gone
[11:29:30] <arup_r> I am not able to set the focus on click ? http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/PPPgWp
[11:30:50] <zumba_ad_> folks, on my error: function(collection, response, options), the response looks like a promise. I see methods like  "abort, always, complete, done, ..etc". How can I access it inside the error callback?
[11:53:34] <zumba_ad_> Based from what I've noticed with ajax timeout(just a confirmation from you folks), that when we setup a retry in ajaPrefilter, it will not go to error callback until it has completed the number of retries we have set. I placed a breakpoint on the prefilter and on the error. It went to prefilter 3 times before it went to error
[13:04:53] <toothe> okay I can't figure this out from Google.
[13:05:07] <toothe> I am trying to select a <SELECT> element by its ID. How do I do that?
[13:05:12] <toothe> by its ID or value.
[13:05:37] <toothe> a lot of Gogle examples speak of using .find(), but that function doesn't exist per Chrome.
[13:10:09] <toothe> maybe I'm going aboutthis wrong. I selected my <SELECT> object, but am not sure how to determine the individual selected <OPTION> objects. How does that work?
[13:24:39] <Kartagis> toothe: you want to  get the value of the selected option?
[13:25:58] <Kartagis> toothe: assuming your <select> has an id of select, you want $("#select option:selected").val()
[13:36:26] <adv_> what do you people think about photoswipe?
[13:38:59] <toothe> Kartagis: that certainly works, but can I go from the selected object to the sub-object? (Not sure if my terminology is correct)
[13:39:31] <Kartagis> toothe: define sub object
[13:42:58] <toothe> Kartagis: sure. So I started by selecting the entire <SELECT> as follows: control_pool = $('#control_pool');
[13:43:24] <toothe> now, from control_pool, can I specify an individual <option> element?
[13:43:57] <Kartagis> a selected option element?
[13:44:24] <toothe> It doesn't have to be, I would prefer to iterate through them.
[13:45:02] <Kartagis> $("#control_pool option")
[13:45:18] <Kartagis> if I understood you correctly
[13:45:40] <toothe> i see...
[13:45:42] * toothe tries that
[13:46:54] <toothe> how do I iterate throught hem?
[13:46:55] <toothe> them*
[13:47:07] <arc_> you could use each()
[13:49:57] <Olidac> Hello! Anyone can help me with some JQuery? My code doesn't work and idk why :S
[13:50:48] <Kartagis> Olidac: ask
[13:51:04] <Kartagis> btw, I need some thlp too
[13:51:36] <Olidac> So this is my code : https://jsfiddle.net/kytj0xq8/
[13:51:54] <Olidac> idk if I did it the good way but I am trying to add images to a UL
[13:51:58] <Olidac> but nothing happens
[13:52:02] <Kartagis> http://termbin.com/b996 <--- why don't $("#loginHolder").text() and $.mobile.changePage work?
[14:02:01] <shoky_> Olidac: first, you're doing .append on the id string:  .attr('id').append(...)   which is wrong, strings don't have a .append.  just remove that .attr('id')
[14:02:56] <Olidac> I removed it and it still doesn't work :S
[14:02:57] <shoky_> Olidac: and 2nd, you're doing the append outside of the getJSON callback, so it happens much before the getJSON callback is called. just move the append to be inside the callback
[14:03:07] <Olidac> ohhhhhh
[14:05:06] <Olidac> Ok so I made the changes and it's still not working XD maybe because I use Foundation?
[14:05:34] <shoky_> i donno, maybe because you're not using jsonp correctly for however your serverside is configured
[14:05:47] <shoky_> (server must specifically allow jsonp)
[14:06:07] <shoky_> oh the server is reddit so.
[14:06:22] <Olidac> Yeah :/
[14:06:36] <shoky_> but i don't think jquery looks for a jsonp=?
[14:06:39] <shoky_> it looks for callback=?
[14:06:53] <shoky_> but reddit doesn't like that
[14:07:01] <shoky_> so you can use $.ajax with more specific settings
[14:07:03] <shoky_> sec.
[14:08:37] <Olidac> ok
[14:09:21] <Kartagis> http://termbin.com/b996 <--- why don't $("#loginHolder").text() and $.mobile.changePage work?
[14:10:19] <Olidac> shoky_ : this one works http://jsfiddle.net/DHKtW/170/ but I want to use it so its in a UL list...
[14:15:28] <shoky_> Olidac: oh so its ok with jsonp=?
[14:15:33] <shoky_> Olidac: anyways this works too  https://jsfiddle.net/kytj0xq8/3/
[14:15:53] <shoky_> it doesnt work on jsfiddle cause jsfiddle is on https and the reddit url isn't
[14:16:27] <shoky_> works on jsbin http://jsbin.com/wewizaxisu/1/edit?html,js,output
[14:16:32] <Olidac> ah ok XD I will try it :) Thanks!
[14:17:07] <Olidac> What was the error/problem?
[14:17:34] <shoky_> where
[14:17:35] <shoky_> ?
[14:18:03] <Olidac> in mine XD
[14:18:46] <shoky_> you didn't show yours after fixing those 2 errors
[14:19:18] <Olidac> oh ok XD
[14:21:42] <zumba_ad_> Question folks. Why does the jsonp server still sends the response to our jsonp request even if we have canceled our request via timeout period?
[14:22:50] <shoky_> zumba_ad_ either there was a request or there wasn't..?
[14:23:04] <zumba_ad_> there is a request
[14:23:06] <shoky_> if there was, then there may be a response
[14:23:12] <shoky_> what's the problem ;p
[14:23:19] <zumba_ad_> it responded after the timeout period
[14:23:29] <shoky_> the server?
[14:23:32] <zumba_ad_> yup
[14:23:33] <shoky_> ok, and?
[14:23:53] <zumba_ad_> and if jquery canceled it, it would go inside error: callback
[14:24:32] <zumba_ad_> however, the function will still be called giving us a Uncaught TypeError jquery2352533252_823489237943724 is not a function
[14:24:43] <zumba_ad_> i figured out a solution for this
[14:24:59] <shoky_> can you show your code
[14:25:12] <zumba_ad_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32531360/js-exception-is-still-able-to-sneak-in-but-very-rarely-not-sure-why
[14:25:26] <zumba_ad_> look at the answer that was given to me
[14:25:30] <zumba_ad_> that's the same code I have
[14:25:40] <shoky_> anyway what's the problem that you're getting that error?
[14:25:44] <shoky_> jsonp is a hack
[14:25:51] <shoky_> errors are not even supposed to work for jsonp
[14:25:57] <zumba_ad_> k
[14:26:05] <shoky_> they kinda work only if you set a timeout, but jsonp is a hack using a <script> tag to load data
[14:26:14] <zumba_ad_> so I'm not sure how to word my explanation on our ticketing system
[14:26:21] <zumba_ad_> i don't want to say jsonp is a hack :D
[14:26:32] <zumba_ad_> yup, i agree with you
[14:27:00] <zumba_ad_> Should I say jsonp was really not meant to return errors
[14:27:06] <shoky_> so even if jquery "cancels" the request after a timeout,
[14:27:39] <zumba_ad_> k, then
[14:27:58] <zumba_ad_> we would still received the response, correct?
[14:28:00] <shoky> sorry got disconnected
[14:28:03] <zumba_ad_> oh
[14:28:05] <shoky> [00:26:14] <zumba_ad_> so I'm not sure how to word my explanation on our ticketing system
[14:28:06] <shoky> [00:26:16] <shoky_> so even if jquery "cancels" the request after a timeout,
[14:28:06] <shoky> [00:26:33] <shoky_> the <script> tag might still be able to finish loading right then and trigger that error
[14:28:19] <zumba_ad_> cool
[14:28:25] <zumba_ad_> that's what i'll write :D
[14:28:28] <zumba_ad_> thanks buddy
[14:28:29] <shoky> ;D
[14:28:30] <shoky> np
[14:30:41] <toothe> odd, my .each() loop only iterates once.
[14:31:05] <shoky> your each() loop is weird. i prefer mine
[14:31:38] <toothe> yeah, i think i prefer yours too.
[14:31:41] <toothe> no, im prob doing something wrong.
[14:31:51] <toothe> and...i tink I figured it out.
[14:37:55] <toothe> fixed it, silly me.
[14:39:20] <toothe> can I go from an object element to selecting its sub-element WITHOUT doing something like this: $("#object subelement)
[14:39:45] <toothe> can I instead do $("#object").subelement("#subelement") ?
[14:39:50] <toothe> is there some format by which I Can dot hat?
[14:39:58] <toothe> some function by which I can do that*
[15:18:17] <printForever> hello you beautiful, but slightly fat, people of the interwebz and IRC
[15:18:26] <printForever> I haz ein problem
[15:18:38] <printForever> no news flash there, I guess
[15:19:09] <printForever> what jQuery plugin do you recommend for replacing HTML SELECT/OPTION in forms?
[15:19:39] <rcyr> select2 is probably the less awful of them
[15:19:51] <printForever> I just googled it, before coming here
[15:20:02] <printForever> it looks a bit bloated, anything smaller?
[15:21:52] <printForever> long time ago I've ran into SelectBoxIt
[15:23:12] <arc_> toothe it depends on what you mean by sub-element. if you mean child, then you can use children()
[15:23:45] <printForever> maybe he is hungry and is thinking about SUBWAY
[15:23:45] <arc_> if you mean siblings, then you can use siblings() or maybe next() or prev() depending on what you are trying to do
[15:24:13] <printForever> * this message was not paid or in any way sponsored by SUBWAY, thank you
[15:24:43] <printForever> jQuery rocks, you're beautiful! love youz!
[15:52:40] <Hilton> Is there anything "wrong" with storing data directly in a jQuery object (sandwich = $('#ham'); sandwich.tasty = true;) rather than using .data() if I have no need of that data once the object is released (say, replaced by sandwich = $('#turkey');)?
[16:07:39] <shoky> Hilton: not wrong per se, if you really only need it for just as long as this jquery object exists. but i cant think of when you'd really wanna do that
[16:11:32] <cxmu> hello my friends and family
[16:11:39] <cxmu> does anyone here know zurb foundation
[16:19:58] <Hilton> shoky: Event handling. Object is stored in a variable on mousedown, worked with during mousemove, finalized during mouseup. Ignored after that, replaced on next mousedown.
[16:21:25] <Hilton> The variable is..I'm not sure what to call it. It is defined like this: (function ($, undefined) { var myObject = null; $.fn.myplugin = function() { ... } ... }
[16:22:31] <Hilton> Doesn't seem to be global.
[16:25:30] <shoky> i've lost you ;p
[16:25:38] <shoky> er or you've lost me. or whatever
[16:29:47] <voltair3> how do i create an element with innerhtml that isnt a string, example: $('ul').append('<li>array'i
[16:30:16] <voltair3> how do i create an element with innerhtml that isnt a string, example: $('ul').append('<li>array[i].a</li>');
[16:32:50] <shoky> you can concatenate strings with +
[16:38:55] <Hilton> shoky: Immediately Invoked Function Expression, protects "$" and also lets you have private variables
[16:39:20] <Hilton> shoky: https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/#protecting-the-alias-and-adding-scope
[16:40:23] <shoky> Hilton: yeah i know what those are, just didn't understand what you were saying about it. but it doesn't matter ;p
[16:44:02] <adv_> $( "a" ).click(function(e){  e.preventDefault();	console.log("a clicked");});
[16:44:14] <adv_> why is this not working? links still work i mean
[17:00:28] <Hilton> adv_: http://jsfiddle.net/x6fpdaoc/ -- works fine.
[17:00:37] <Hilton> Do you have it contained in a ready function?
[17:00:40] <adv_> yeah that was it
[17:00:42] <adv_> thanks
[17:56:50] <Voyage>  I need a framework / lib for websites by which I can make a website that loads in a webview of an android app but (still being a webpage) looks like a native mobile app (or even better). Are there any prebuild things that has menus, buttons, layouts etc that fits mobile screens and tabs?
[18:00:25] <snover> Voyage: no. if you want something that looks like a native app then you should make a native app.
[18:03:21] <Voyage> snover,  I can make similar or even better
[18:03:26] <Voyage> in web
[18:03:53] <snover> nope
[18:03:55] <snover> you cannot.
[18:05:13] <drej> you can get pretty close
[18:05:19] <drej> depending on what youre building
[18:06:28] <Voyage> drej,  ya, how?
[18:06:44] <drej> i already linked you to a decent framework
[18:07:08] <Voyage> right
[18:07:16] <Voyage> drej,  any views about jquery mobile?
[18:07:32] <drej> yup, stay 200ft away from it at all times
[18:07:41] <Voyage> drej,  why???
[18:07:44] <drej> because its shit
[18:07:52] <Voyage> really? why would you say that/
[18:09:25] <arc_> i doubt there's a framework yet that would make something that looks nearly as good as a properly designed material app
[18:09:46] <Voyage> drej,  ?
[18:10:05] <drej> arc_: i mean even google has released a decent material design framework to build on web technologies
[18:10:27] <drej> seriously, its not that hard to get 90% close to native for most functional interfaces with web technologies these days
[18:10:39] <drej> Voyage: its antiquated, bloated, dead project that was built to support old devices
[18:11:06] <arc_> the thing is that if you build using polymer, that's what it will look like on ios too
[18:12:02] <drej> i wasnt talking about polymer
[18:12:19] <drej> its all relative to what youre trying to do
[18:12:19] <arc_> ok, well it's the same with whatever else
[18:12:22] <Voyage> arc_,  whats polymer?
[18:12:31] <drej> you look at any functional-driven application (bankign app or whatever)
[18:12:37] <drej> they're all mostly platform agnostic from a design perspective
[18:13:10] <arc_> https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/
[18:13:28] <drej> plus there are ways to adjust how it looks depending on the platform; all im saying is that webviews these days are close enough that you can get the behaviour and performance of a native UI (or 90% to it)
[18:13:32] <drej> and build the thing only once
[18:14:27] <arc_> they're pretty good. the differences are kind of important though
[18:15:02] <arc_> or can be, depending on what you're doing, anywa
[18:15:03] <arc_> y
[18:15:10] <drej> yeah, it depends on what youre building for sure
[18:15:30] <drej> we build quite a few hybrid webapps
[18:15:37] <drej> at my dayjob thing
[18:16:09] <Voyage> drej,  arc_
[18:16:10] <Voyage> responsive website but the one only runs on phones inside a webview. I plan to exchange data to and from native phone (posible by android functions i guess). Doing this to use same website on iOS and still avoid my too much data to be fetched each time via API calls. + I will be able to change design and functionality of app from web server. I dont have to require my users to update their app
[18:16:39] <drej> okay
[18:16:47] <Voyage> sane?
[18:16:56] <drej> you'll have issues publishing that to the apple store
[18:17:05] <drej> they generally dont like it when you host core interface components not within the app
[18:17:09] <drej> its a security concern
[18:17:41] <Voyage> :|
[18:17:46] <Voyage> I hate ios
[18:17:50] <drej> well, it makes sense
[18:18:03] <Voyage> what security concerns?
[18:18:06] <drej> i mean whats to prevent you from getting a bunch of people to install the app, then you completely change what it is by hosting different files
[18:18:12] <drej> and use it to exploit information
[18:18:18] <drej> or if someone compromises your servers
[18:18:40] <drej> or any number of things
[18:18:56] <drej> if the core funcitonality of the app doesnt reside within the app, you're opening the door up to a lot of potential issues
[18:19:12] <drej> google store would probably have an issue with it as well, they changed their policies a few months ago
[18:20:02] <Voyage> hm
[18:20:44] <Voyage> drej,  then why phonegap is still a success in ios and android?
[18:21:07] <drej> phonegap's intent is to host the html/css/js files within the app
[18:21:30] <drej> the data points (apis) can be hosted remotely, of course
[18:21:55] <drej> so you can do everything you want, minus "I will be able to change design and functionality of app from web server"
[18:22:31] <Voyage> hm
[18:26:21] <Voyage> drej,  can you give reference to that rule? drej> google store would probably have an issue with it as well, they changed their policies a few months ago
[18:31:29] <drej> probably somewhere in here http://developer.android.com/guide/webapps/index.html
[18:31:40] <drej> https://play.google.com/apps/publish/
[18:31:45] <drej> and read through all kinds of info there too
[18:33:02] <Voyage> hm
[18:34:04] <Voyage> drej,  but I cant see any policy of android that dissallows total app in webview streaming from webserver
[18:34:41] <drej> then the part where i said "would probably" was incorrect
[18:34:49] <Voyage> hm
[18:35:24] <drej> if youre going to be deploying it on android only
[18:35:25] <drej> then build it natively
[18:37:07] <Voyage> drej,  plan to make it for android for now and ios for later
[18:37:30] <Voyage> but I did heard strict things in iOS world for such webviews
[18:58:10] <voltair3> beginner question about loops and creating elements, please help: http://jsbin.com/hobutibuvi/edit?html,js,console,output
[19:32:32] <shoky_> voltair3: $('<ul>').append('<li>...</li><li>...</li>').appendTo('body')

[20:38:06] <hassoon> hi
[20:38:13] <hassoon> before i continue my work i wanted to check if this piece  of code that i wrote is right  http://pastebin.ca/3160766
[20:38:19] <hassoon> Am i about to fetch through the list of inout boxed of the form inside that <div> having with an id being id_modal? :o

[20:43:51] <hassoon> yes i just tested it with an alert(), and it was true
[20:43:54] <hassoon> thanks anyway
[22:46:38] <toothe> is there a way to reverse a jquery list?
[22:46:46] <toothe> im googling and finding reverse() but don't seem to hav ethat.
[23:07:58] <guessx> toothe isnt it reverse().sort()?
