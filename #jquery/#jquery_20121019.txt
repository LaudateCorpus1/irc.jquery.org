[00:00:06] <Cork> iaj: just put the form in a normal div and make the div display: none;
[00:00:19] <Cork> iaj: and then show the div when you want it
[00:00:47] <Cork> iaj: if you want it to be a bit more stylish (movable for example) use one of the dialog plugins out there
[00:00:57] <Cork> jquery-ui has one thats quite nice
[00:04:07] <iaj> hmm so I'd create a div with pos: absolute
[00:04:14] <iaj> and z-index: rather high...
[00:04:16] <Cork> yes
[00:04:33] <iaj> and then have it hidden on page load … kk I can attach animations later right?
[00:04:45] <Cork> sure
[00:04:54] <iaj> Thanks man!
[00:05:19] <Cork> instead of $('#popup-form').show() you can do .show('slow'), or even get fancier with .animate if you like
[00:05:26] <Cork> uh..
[00:05:30] <Cork> show('slow')
[00:05:47] <Cork> -_-' sorry miss read my own code >_<'
[00:07:52] <iaj> ahhh.... but the rest won't get 'shaded out' with a simple .show('slow') right?
[00:07:54] <coldhead> misread*
[00:08:19] <Cork> iaj: ah, no you need a cover screen for that
[00:09:26] <Cork> #cover { position: fixed; top:0; left:0; right:0; bottom:0; background-color: white; opacity: .7; z-index: (one less the the "popup); } should cover that
[00:12:01] <iaj> thanks Cork again... I will tell ya later if I succeeded :)

[00:35:42] <oojacoboo> why does this flash in and not out as well?
[00:36:22] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/3zZqS/1/
[00:38:58] <oojacoboo> it was working on 1.7.x
[00:39:06] <oojacoboo> all the sudden, 1.8 has broken it
[00:39:22] <chare> how would I do <script async ...> with both jquery and jquery-ui
[00:56:19] <Cork> chare: the same way to make everything else load async
[00:56:29] <Cork> put it at the end of the body
[00:57:24] <chare> thats not async, its not downloading the javascript at the same time as the html
[00:57:40] <chare> i mean as its parsing
[00:57:42] <chare> the html
[01:00:41] <chare> Cork answer me
[01:04:09] <Cork> chare: uh, you'll have to wait for the answer, ppl have other things to do
[01:04:15] <Cork> it'll come
[01:04:30] <Cork> chare: what does parsing have to do with <script> tags?
[01:04:38] <Cork> and jquery + jquery-ui for that matter
[01:04:52] <Cork> (parsing html)
[01:05:08] <chare> parsing of the jquery and jqurey-ui blocks parsing of html
[01:05:34] <Cork> you'r talking about the .html() call?
[01:09:35] <faraway> oojacoboo: for animating you need jquery ui

[01:14:16] <NodeX> change from to ;)
[01:14:29] <UltraMC> NodeX paste it somewhere please?
[01:14:38] <NodeX> I just did
[01:14:55] <UltraMC> um I dont get it
[01:15:16] <NodeX> change "open : {" INTO  "open : function() {"
[01:15:23] <NodeX> how difficult is that to understand?
[01:15:29] <UltraMC> now its better
[01:15:52] <soee> what would be the best way to find all list elements with class active but exclude selected one (the one mouseover it )?
[01:16:03] <NodeX> soee : not()

[01:16:54] <directy> hey guys, i'm trying to build a page with an iframe that can be resized (like on jsfiddle or jsbin): http://jsfiddle.net/Yr7ka/4/ without the iframe it works perfectly fine, but with iframe i cant move the slider to the right side. any ideas how so solve this issue? thanks
[01:18:54] <faraway> directy: the iframe is catching the mousemove event. thats the problem
[01:19:04] <studybot_> hello everyone
[01:19:19] <studybot_> what happen if i select an javascript $(jsObject)
[01:19:25] <faraway> directy: on solution would be that you place a div with the size of the iframe over the iframe while resizing.
[01:19:54] <directy> sounds good, i'll give it a try. thank you faraway :-)
[01:22:44] <fALSO> nom dia
[01:26:33] <seutje> studybot_: it'll just return the object afaik
[01:29:15] <angelazou> having some drag and drop problem with this snippet http://jsbin.com/egiher/1/edit
[01:29:26] <angelazou> interestingly, it worked on ie and nothing else, which is usually the other way around
[01:29:57] <angelazou> so it seem like I can't drag from items in the right bar to those empty spots on the left bar
[01:30:16] <angelazou> i thought it was the containment property's problem, but it was correct
[01:30:24] <directy> faraway: your hint worked pretty well, thanks a lot
[01:30:36] <angelazou> so i'm not sure what to do next
[01:32:36] <faraway> directy: np
[01:33:26] <anli> If I use animate, will not that imply jquery first calling stop()?
[01:35:26] <fotoflo> Hmmmmm …… i have a  <li> that's sortable, and in it is a .slider() .. and then I'm using jquery.clone(true, true ) on the li -- the sortable stuff is getting cloned but when i try to grab the slider, I'm getting stuck grabbing the whole LI
[01:36:07] <impi> hey guys, happy friday man : )
[01:36:39] <impi> i have a ol element, with some li's - i have added a input above and want to only show similar results from autocomplete
[01:36:47] <faraway> fotoflo: i'm pretty sure that you can't clone jquery ui elements that way
[01:37:06] <angelazou> anyone?
[01:37:17] <impi> my example is here: http://dev.flashsales.local/woman.html bottom left under brands
[01:37:22] <impi> grrr
[01:37:46] <impi> http://dev.a.touchlab.co.za/woman.html
[01:38:55] <fotoflo> faraway: actually i think i solved my problem but generated a new problem
[01:39:39] <fotoflo> my problem now is that with clone, i now have two items with the same id
[01:39:49] <fotoflo> jquery ui stuff seems to work
[01:40:17] <fotoflo> the other problem is figuring out where in the DOM tree to append the clone
[01:42:15] <faraway> fotoflo: well then you sould not use id's or change the id on the cloned element
[01:42:35] <fotoflo> have to figure out how to change the id
[01:43:03] <waseem_> Hi, I'm making a POSTing some data using $.post. The success handler is not called though. What am I doing wrong? https://gist.github.com/3916993 The server returns a 200 OK when the request is made.
[01:43:27] <waseem_> s/making a//
[01:45:38] <faraway> waseem_: probably you are not returning a valid json
[01:45:46] <waseem_> The console.log in the success handler is never executed. I also tried pasting the same code in the chrome dev tools. The request is made in this case as well bu I still I don't see log message in it.
[01:46:38] <waseem_> faraway: That could be. Let me check. Thanks
[01:48:56] <waseem_> faraway: Hmm you're right. Thanks for your help. I was facing this issue http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12407328/rails-head-ok-interpreted-as-ajaxerror
[01:54:51] <soee> can i somehow compare if 2 elements are the same ?
[01:56:04] <pingec> if I store an object with $('div').data('mykey', myObject) is it just the reference to the object that is stored or is the object copied?
[01:56:08] <beachandbytes> the same in which way?
[02:00:14] <PBDev> QUESTION:  I have a jquery menu with slideToggle, where the submenus appear/dissapear as the menu is clicked
[02:00:35] <PBDev> the only problem is, how do I keep the submenus open after click depending on the page?
[02:04:15] <Cork> PBDev: your doing a full page reload?
[02:04:25] <PBDev> yes
[02:04:52] <Cork> then you have to build it based on the url, or something else on the server side
[02:05:08] <Cork> when the page reloads all js info and dom state are lost
[02:08:09] <PBDev> so I probably need to use $_GET['']; Do I write this in the jquery section though?
[02:08:41] <Cork> that depends on how you prefer to implement it, but ya thats one way
[02:09:30] <PBDev> but how do I keep it open? The jquery would have to get the page, and rerun the jquery and keep the submenu open
[02:10:17] <Cork> PBDev: you would have to ex. set a class on the element
[02:39:56] <fotoflo> hmm, so i have a function that appends to a selector . in this case I am passing in a <ul>  is there a way to append after specific index in the <ul> ?
[02:40:44] <Cork> ?.after
[02:40:45] <bot-t> .after(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[02:41:21] <Cork> so $('ul li').eq(10).after()
[02:42:02] <fotoflo> $(selector).append() appends to the end
[02:42:09] <fotoflo> whats eq?
[02:42:17] <Cork> ?.eq
[02:42:18] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[02:42:40] <coppa> ??
[02:42:54] <coppa> (tried to play with the bot in a stupd way sorry :D )
[02:44:20] <fotoflo> $('ul li').eq(10).after() <-- dont understand
[02:44:38] <fotoflo> $('ul li').eq(10).after().append() to append after?
[02:44:42] <Cork> no
[02:44:45] <coppa> you insert something after the tenth li element
[02:44:50] <Cork> after is what you want, not append
[02:45:16] <Cork> fotoflo: $('ul li').eq(10).after("<li>I'm new here</li>")
[02:45:18] <coppa> .after(htmlCode or element)
[02:45:31] <fotoflo> ok
[02:45:55] <Cork> fotoflo: it grabs the list of li elements, finds the 11'th elements and inserts the li element after that one
[02:46:05] <fotoflo> can i do after() with an empty selector to append to the end of the list?
[02:46:10] <Cork> no
[02:46:26] <Cork> you can't insert after something that doesn't exist
[02:47:06] <Cork> fotoflo: if you always want to insert at the top, theres prepend
[02:47:33] <fotoflo> i want to append to the end unless i have an index to append after passed in
[02:47:57] <Cork> then you need to check if the ul is empty see ?.empty
[02:47:58] <bot-t> .empty(): Remove all child nodes of the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/empty/
[02:48:04] <Cork> opps, thats wrong
[02:48:07] <Cork> lol
[02:48:13] <Cork> its .length > 0 sorry
[02:52:02] <schwanken> Hello
[02:52:15] <schwanken> I call getJSON in a function of a javascript class
[02:52:48] <schwanken> And I want to set a class member of my class to the result of the getJSON
[02:53:17] <Cork> you need to store this in a variable
[02:53:44] <Cork> var my_class = this; $.getJSON(url, function(data) { my_class.member = data; });
[02:54:00] <coppa> i just tested $(this).after($(this)); send to the space gate anelement
[02:54:04] <coppa> eheh
[02:54:19] <Cork> you don't need $() around this there
[02:54:25] <Cork> :)
[02:54:27] <Cork> but ya :)
[02:54:32] <coppa> true :)
[02:55:38] <fotoflo> cork:  so i have an element, i  have a selector and an after (index) , i want to append the element at the index child element of the slector
[02:56:48] <beachandbytes> example?
[02:57:57] <schwanken> @Cork: Thank you, this is strange ( as javascript is sometimes), but it works perfectly :)
[02:58:35] <fotoflo> i have a <ul id = "a" ><li ><li><li>  structure I want to append another LI after the second ul of a
[02:59:14] <fotoflo> sort second LI of a
[03:00:36] <beachandbytes> $('#a').children().eq(1).append('<li></li>');
[03:01:52] <fotoflo> thanks
[03:01:56] <fotoflo> giving it a shot
[03:04:47] <fotoflo> herm it doesn't work if there's no children
[03:05:20] <mazzachre> Is it correct that there is no "hover" events, so I can't do .on("hover", {blob: 3}, function(e) { ... e.data.blob ... }, function(e) {... e.data.blob ...})? So if I need custom arguments, I would need to use mouseenter/mouseleave manually?
[03:06:18] <shoky> mazzachre: ye
[03:06:19] <fotoflo> beachandbytes: in the case that there's no children of the UL, it fails without an error
[03:06:31] <mazzachre> ok, thx
[03:09:46] <shoky> fotoflo: check the length, as Cork told you
[03:10:38] <Koopz> jquery autocomplete remote search behaviour...i need to add a second parameter to the term it is using
[03:11:12] <MACscr> so im using show() to show hidden div on click, but i want it to hide again a when i am no longer hovering over it. Since show is overriding the css, im not 100% sure how i should do that. I know its simple, but its 5am and im not thinking to straight =/
[03:11:16] <Cork> fotoflo: your mixing up terms and that makes it a bit hard to follow what you mean
[03:11:36] <Cork> fotoflo: do you want to append to or insert after; you can't append after
[03:12:08] <fotoflo> Cork: so if there's no elements in the list, i guess i want to append, and if there are elements, i want to insert
[03:12:24] <shoky> Koopz: use a function as 'source' and you can do whatever you want
[03:13:14] <shoky> fotoflo: then do that. javascript has 'if'
[03:13:16] <Koopz> so... i'd call an Ajax-Request in that function and return the result... and it works?
[03:13:35] <Rajni> hey guys, i have a recursive function that updates an img src of a given class, if that class is assigned dinamically, can this still works?
[03:13:46] <shoky> Koopz: no, not return the result, there's a special calback you need to call
[03:13:50] <fotoflo> doing it ;) thanks! thanks Cork and beachandbytes
[03:13:54] <Cork> fotoflo: ok so if($('#a').children().length > 0) { $('#a').children().eq(1).after('new'); } else { $('#a').append('new') }
[03:14:01] <shoky> Koopz: take a look at the examples on http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp
[03:14:54] <Cork> fotoflo: and you prob want to store the jquery objects in a variable so you don't have to recreate them all the time
[03:15:05] <fotoflo> yeah
[03:15:07] <fotoflo> i am
[03:15:16] <fotoflo> :-) I've abstracted the question a little
[03:15:25] <Cork> perfect :)
[03:17:16] <shoky> Rajni: wat..?
[03:17:43] <TheBrayn> under which conditions is the error part of an ajax request executed?
[03:18:38] <Cork> TheBrayn: http 4xx 5xx status messages, and parsing errors
[03:18:57] <TheBrayn> hmk
[03:20:17] <fotoflo> DONE! it works
[03:20:19] <fotoflo> thanks guys
[03:21:07] <El_Caballero> Hello guys... I am trying to add some jQuery effects to my website... but, for any reason it is not working. http://190.36.230.36:8080/tuclasificadoonline.com/vaadin there is the address
[03:21:27] <MACscr> hmm, there must be a simple way to show on click, but hide when no longer hovering. hover() would be fine on its own if i didnt need the click option
[03:21:46] <El_Caballero> when I click the "cloud"... it has to dissapear... but.. It doesn't :(
[03:21:59] <shoky> MACscr: mouseout() or mouseleave()
[03:22:15] <MACscr> shoky: thanks, i will look into it
[03:23:15] <mrHat> is it possible to get 1234 from <input type="text" name="test[1234]" /> ??? I can do $('input[name="test[]"]') but that will just get the whole value of name not 1234
[03:23:33] <fALSO> there are wildcards
[03:23:41] <El_Caballero> what am i missing? I am adding jquery-1.8.2.min.js to the web... and in the java.js is the corresponding effect :(
[03:24:38] <fALSO> mrhat,  im using this $("*[class^='box']"). to find all the elements which class starts with box
[03:24:48] <fALSO> so surely theres a way to do what you want
[03:26:15] <fotoflo> MrHat: why don't you use a regex to parse out the 1234?
[03:28:58] <mrHat> fotoflo: i thought it was another way to do it
[03:29:18] <shoky> El_Caballero:  that #cloud element is not in the DOM when the $(document).ready is called
[03:29:30] <shoky> El_Caballero: so those 2 $('#cloud')...  lines don't do anything
[03:29:35] <fotoflo> mrHat: might be… regex will probably be asier
[03:29:39] <fotoflo> easier
[03:29:51] <El_Caballero> shoky: oh, let me search about it
[03:30:19] <fotoflo> mrHat: you want to just parse out that number right?
[03:30:47] <mrHat> match(/\[(\d+)\]/);
[03:31:46] <shoky> there's no easier way than that ;p
[03:31:58] <mrHat> shoky ?
[03:32:04] <shoky> yes?
[03:32:31] <mrHat> what easier way :)
[03:32:41] <shoky> think you misread what i said ;p
[03:33:24] <mrHat> ahh yeah
[03:33:26] <mrHat> haha
[03:33:32] <shoky> ;]
[03:34:08] <MACscr> shoky: hmm, that didnt seem to fully work. The element I have set to show on click, hides when I hover over it, even though i have the mouseout() function set to its parent element, so it should include it
[03:34:40] <shoky> MACscr: tried mouseleave ?
[03:35:39] <MACscr> shoky: genius
[03:35:46] <MACscr> thanks again for the help. i really appreciate it
[03:35:54] <shoky> ;] np
[03:37:20] <scarlet_razor> hello... i cannot understand how it cannot be return to previous position +JQ UI
[03:37:21] <scarlet_razor> http://jsfiddle.net/navotera/FKQU3/1/
[03:37:21] <scarlet_razor> can anyone help me out ?
[03:37:22] <El_Caballero> shoky: I added the java.js after the cloud... is that what you mean? It doesn't work yet :(. I am a kinda new with jQuery :(
[03:39:52] <iaj> What's the most common way to have ('#foo').fadeIn(); called after page has been loaded for 3sec?
[03:40:14] <shoky> El_Caballero no. you need to run thos 2 lines not in the document.ready, because #cloud doesn't exist then yet. you need to call them after that element is put into the DOM
[03:40:40] <shoky> El_Caballero:  for the .click  you could also leave it in the document.ready and do:  $(document).on('click', '#cloud', function() { .... })
[03:41:54] <Already> iaj setTimeout but it doesnt sound like a good idea
[03:42:19] <angelazou> hi guys, I'm having a sound problem
[03:42:29] <angelazou> the function gets called but the sound is never added
[03:42:33] <angelazou> here is my snippet http://jsbin.com/imeyok/1/edit
[03:42:36] <El_Caballero> shoky: ok, let me research about it
[03:43:08] <angelazou> ah, sorry, this is the right one http://jsbin.com/imeyok/2/edit
[03:43:47] <scarlet_razor> hai pals is there anyone who good in UI i need advice bout the dragable+sortable
[03:44:18] <scarlet_razor> let me know i u wanna check it
[03:44:19] <scarlet_razor> http://jsfiddle.net/navotera/FKQU3/1/
[03:44:27] <angelazou> so when i look at the console, i see what i need to see ] edit:18 0 edit:19 <source src="../res/audio/Flip.mp3" loop="false"></source><source src="../res/audio/Flip.ogg" loop="false"></source><source src="../res/audio/Flip.wav" loop="false"></source>Sorry, Your Browser Does not Support HTML5 Audio
[03:45:22] <Rajni> guys i have onready function to update the img.src of a given class, if that class is assigned to other element dinamically does the function still applies to it? or do i have to call it again?
[03:46:51] <djsounds02> Anybody free to help me with a jquery plugin?
[03:46:55] <shoky> angelazou:  your code works for me
[03:46:57] <mikecmpbll> I'm creating a div on a .hover binding
[03:47:02] <shoky> angelazou: i hear it playing ;>
[03:47:08] <mikecmpbll> and destroying it on the handlerOut function
[03:47:15] <shoky> angelazou:  (of course, i changed the url of the audio file)
[03:47:25] <mikecmpbll> how come it flickers like hell when moving the mouse through the parent
[03:47:36] <angelazou> shoky, then it must be other code interfering
[03:47:46] <angelazou> let me paste a full version
[03:47:46] <Already> You might have to use .on mikecmpbll if you want the created div to listen to the same event Handler.
[03:47:47] <mikecmpbll> oh fml, scratch that, i solved it
[03:48:21] <mikecmpbll> i think i was creating the 2nd div over the original
[03:49:39] <mikecmpbll> another question though: is there a way that i can determine what the height of my newly created div will be, before I've appended it to the page?
[03:49:45] <angelazou> shoky, this is the full version http://jsbin.com/imeyok/3/edit
[03:49:52] <mikecmpbll> it's necessary for me to position it correctly.
[03:49:58] <angelazou> can you try again?
[03:50:56] <shoky> angelazou: it's playing
[03:51:33] <djsounds02> http://costapropertiesforsale.com/  On the top right, there is a property search, on the location select I need a scrollbar as the list is very long. this doesn't seem to work though as when You click on the scrollbar it is closing the options back up. I think it is listening for the click outside the box so any click on anything but an option closes it back up. the plugin is
[03:51:33] <djsounds02> http://www.bulgaria-web-developers.com/projects/javascript/selectbox/
[03:52:07] <shoky> angelazou: heh i think it's even playing twice, simultaneously
[03:52:33] <shoky> or maybe that's just jsbin interfering
[04:01:37] <angelazou> ah, did i miss anything?
[04:01:56] <angelazou> shoky: sorry, the web IRC can be unstable sometimes, did i miss anything?
[04:02:34] <shoky> angelazou: i said it's playing
[04:02:47] <angelazou> oh, thanks
[04:05:41] <Rajni> how can i put some listener to respond when i change a class of an element? is that possible
[04:06:48] <djsounds02> http://costapropertiesforsale.com/  On the top right, there is a property search, on the location select I need a scrollbar as the list is very long. this doesn't seem to work though as when You click on the scrollbar it is closing the options back up. I think it is listening for the click outside the box so any click on anything but an option closes it back up. the plugin is
[04:06:48] <djsounds02> http://www.bulgaria-web-developers.com/projects/javascript/selectbox/
[04:07:00] <iaj> Already: thanks!   settimeout.. hm.. do you have an example handy?
[04:07:45] <shoky> djsounds02: it's the 'blur' event causing the plugin to hide it
[04:08:05] <noregret> anybody used http://www.xarg.org/2011/09/jquery-pagination-revised/ for pagination ?
[04:08:41] <djsounds02> shoky: does it need it?
[04:08:58] <shoky> djsounds02: what?
[04:09:18] <djsounds02> what is the blur function doing?
[04:09:24] <djsounds02> why is it there?
[04:09:26] <djsounds02> just for fancy?
[04:09:42] <shoky> djsounds02: hiding the selectbox
[04:10:34] <djsounds02> so If I delete it then the box wont close?
[04:10:48] <MalMen> jquery is case sensitive ?
[04:10:50] <shoky> could be
[04:11:04] <djsounds02> gone but still not solved
[04:11:21] <shoky> MalMen: sure
[04:11:47] <MalMen> its a jquery thing or its a javascript thing ?
[04:11:49] <djsounds02> :(
[04:12:14] <shoky> djsounds02: the scrollbar works now
[04:12:18] <shoky> ;]
[04:12:57] <djsounds02> no in ie it doesnt!
[04:12:59] <djsounds02> or chrome!
[04:13:08] <shoky> works in chrome for me
[04:13:16] <djsounds02> on mac or pc?
[04:13:21] <shoky> pc
[04:13:43] <djsounds02> strange client is saying that it doesnt work on chrome
[04:13:54] <shoky> why don't you use  chosen or select2 ?
[04:14:08] <djsounds02> which is?
[04:14:11] <djsounds02> are they plguins?
[04:14:13] <shoky> yes
[04:14:24] <djsounds02> easy to implement in place of?
[04:14:58] <shoky> uh should be, dont remember which one is better/more updated
[04:15:01] <shoky> so check both
[04:15:49] <shoky> scrollbar works fine on firefox too
[04:16:39] <shoky> ya but yer right bout ie

[04:31:33] <MACscr> so if im doing click() to show a div and expand it, how would i hide it once i clicked anywhere else. So mouseleave() works if the mouse actually moves outside it, but i want it to be outside it AND clicked
[04:41:05] <[diecast]> MACscr: wrap it in an if statement
[04:41:06] <[diecast]> ?
[04:45:53] <lak200x> is there any way to do this:  var b = $(this).find('li:first');  $(b).show(); $(b).hide()
[04:46:42] <lak200x> i cant get the b to really reference the item.  how can I put the $(this).find('li:first') in a variable, so I can use the very same object later (and not try to retreive it thru the same way, as new items might have arrived.) thanks!
[04:48:18] <MACscr> [diecast]: im not 100% sure how you envision that working. Here is my test http://jsfiddle.net/KhcvR/1030/
[04:50:06] <djsounds02> http://costapropertiesforsale.com/  having trouble getting the chosen plugin to work on this page :(
[04:52:47] <djsounds02> I have 2 errors on console but cannot fix them
[04:56:44] <sylock> hello guys. I have a display bug with Google Chrome (only in my tests - works well with IE 8 and Firefox 16). I'm using the twitter bootstrap CSS framework. I have a fixed menu on the left and want to add the class "active" to highligh the current active menu (on html point of view it is a link to an anchor). here is the code : http://pastebin.com/3pq9h8BL
[04:57:27] <sylock> so with Google Chrome, when I click on a submenu (sometimes - not every time), it mess the display of the others div on the page
[04:58:01] <sylock> (it is hidden but if I move the mouse cursor on it it some parts reappears ...)
[04:58:12] <sylock> is someone have a clue? An idea?
[05:01:10] <heyho_____> hey all, why dow jquery Tab doent like a full url in the link?
[05:02:43] <heyho_____> what i mean is: <a href="http://exampple.de/page1.html#item-0">Page 1</a> doesnt work but when i write <a href="item-0">Page 1</a> it works
[05:02:58] <lak200x> is there any way to do this:  var b = $(this).find('li:first');  $(b).show(); $(b).hide()
[05:02:59] <djsounds02> : http://costapropertiesforsale.com/  having trouble getting the chosen plugin to work on this page :(
[05:03:00] <lak200x> i cant get the b to really reference the item.  how can I put the $(this).find('li:first') in a variable, so I can use the very same object later (and not try to retreive it thru the same way, as new items might have arrived.) thanks!
[05:04:20] <shoky> djsounds02: you included chosen before jquery
[05:04:33] <shoky> djsounds02: look at your console
[05:04:40] <djsounds02> pfft thanks
[05:07:06] <lak200x> does anyone know how to do something like this? (ie. reference an object in var):  var b = $(this).find('li:first');  $(b).show(); $(b).hide()
[05:08:02] <xec_> lak200x: that should work, but you don't need to wrap the b in $()
[05:08:14] <anew> http://pastebin.com/vewpN8z9 if this is the url being sent in POST data, how do you retrieve each piece of data
[05:08:38] <lak200x> xec_: thanks! cause that doesn't work. i'll try without $()
[05:09:31] <xec_> lak200x: what is "this" in that context?¨
[05:09:35] <xec_> -¨
[05:10:52] <lak200x> xec_: it's a div id that contains several div;s and li's
[05:11:26] <xec_> id? or dom node?
[05:11:45] <anew> anyone?
[05:12:25] <xec_> anew: this is a server side question?
[05:13:07] <xec_> anew: the format looks very strange, will probably need to retrieve the entire querystring and parse it yourself
[05:13:11] <anew> i have this code creating c with jq and ajax
[05:13:56] <anew> yes but query string is not being sent via get
[05:13:58] <xec_> anew: you wrote the script that is generating that url? can you show it?
[05:13:59] <anew> i'm sending it via post
[05:14:08] <anew> so i cant see it in the url
[05:14:20] <anew> l = ((DiFi._queuedType == "post" ? a + "&" : "") + "c%5B%5D=" + l.join("&c%5B%5D="));
[05:15:19] <xec_> am i supposed to know what this is?
[05:15:24] <anew> rofl
[05:16:20] <anew> ok xec_ better question
[05:16:22] <djsounds02> shoky: right I still have the same issue with chrome
[05:16:40] <anew> in chrome console.... under headers...under 'form data'... this is the information being sent via post? or am i looking in the wrong place
[05:17:20] <MACscr> i still have no clue how i am supposed to use an if statement when im just doing animation. I cant simply check if a class has been applied, etc
[05:19:37] <xec_> MACscr: what are you trying to check in the conditional?
[05:20:20] <MACscr> xec_: Im simply doing an animation on click as you can see here http://jsfiddle.net/KhcvR/1030/
[05:20:27] <MACscr> and i just want to undo it if clicked anywhere else
[05:20:48] <MACscr> btw, is there a way i can unapply it versus having to reapply settings again?
[05:20:51] <xec_> anew: yes i believe so (unless im missing something)
[05:22:17] <xec_> MACscr: maybe you're just looking for .stop() ?
[05:22:40] <xec_> MACscr: is this what you wanted? http://jsfiddle.net/KhcvR/1031/
[05:23:27] <MACscr> xec: nope, it should happen on click outside .search
[05:23:35] <shoky> djsounds02: what same issue
[05:23:53] <shoky> djsounds02: now you're not including chosen at all
[05:25:34] <djsounds02> I'm trying select2 instead
[05:25:53] <MACscr> xec_: it looks like this might work: http://jsfiddle.net/KhcvR/1032/
[05:26:30] <MACscr> but wont that run the animation to hide things again on every click anywhere? doesnt seem efficient
[05:26:50] <sahbeewah> is there any way to make a click handler work on an element that is disabled?
[05:32:09] <xec_> MACscr: you could just add a small check, maybe something like this http://jsfiddle.net/KhcvR/1033/
[05:39:31] <MACscr> xec_: and thats still ok? Its still going to be checking that var every time. Its a little better, but still just doesnt seem right. imho
[05:43:03] <xec_> MACscr: click event isnt something that is run hundreds of times a second or anything, and checking a bool var is pretty quick so i think you'll be ok ;)
[05:43:44] <sahbeewah> MACscr: use .focus and .blur?
[05:45:50] <MACscr> sahbeewah: nice call
[05:46:55] <sahbeewah> here u go: http://jsfiddle.net/KhcvR/1034/
[05:46:57] <sahbeewah> hate messy code
[05:47:08] <MACscr> ha, thanks. I had just done it as well
[05:49:26] <Koopz> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp i don't get that code... i need to do an ajax-request... and in my case the response is already like the format the example is returning... still I don't see any list...no javascript errors...but the request is getting called
[05:53:07] <djsounds02> shoky: select2 fixed my issues

[06:05:06] <dblosevn> anew: i didnt understand your question
[06:05:12] <someish> dblosevn, ahhh thanks. I didn't realize you had to escape the last bracket
[06:05:42] <dblosevn> not user why contains didnt work
[06:06:17] <dblosevn> I switched to the ends with selector and added the bracket into the slector
[06:06:27] <dblosevn> *sure not user
[06:07:06] <anew> dblosevn i have that query string being sent to my server via GET in my ajax... but i can't access it with $_GET['c[0]'] so i dot know what to do

[06:14:13] <dblosevn> anew: http://pastebin.com/RyLsAGF6 try that
[06:14:28] <dblosevn> oh
[06:14:30] <dblosevn> never mind
[06:14:43] <dblosevn> its $_GET['c'][0]

[06:19:51] <ShawnRisk> If I want to split out the a of an li plus the a within the div next to this, how do I do this?  I have $( "#topnav a" ).each but could I add two of them there?  I have <li><a></a><div><a></a><a></a><a></a><a></a></div></li>
[06:21:08] <toter> Hi everybody. I'm a beginner and I want to add the code on the following website to format the tab size on google code prettify. How do I do that? http://joshkoberstein.com/blog/2012/08/google-code-prettify-tab-characters
[06:23:58] <ndee> what's the opposite of the descendants selector? I want a selector with something like this: $(this).ancestor('form'). Is that possible?
[06:25:42] <ndee> closest it is
[06:25:53] <dblosevn> ndee: $(this).parents('form');
[06:26:32] <dblosevn> ndee: $(this).parents('form').get(0);
[06:26:35] <ShawnRisk> any thoughts on my problem?
[06:27:07] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: im looking at yours now already knew the answer to ndee
[06:27:39] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: thanks
[06:27:57] <sontek> I'm dynamically adding elements on the page, whats the best way to keep scrolling the page as I add the elements
[06:28:08] <sontek> so that they can keep working without having to scroll manually
[06:28:21] <sontek> I just want to keep scrolling to keep a specific div in view
[06:29:21] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: $('#topnav a').next('div') will give you the next div after a
[06:29:51] <qvarkk> how can i return the variable xs from inside callback function in this jquery function? http://pastebin.com/9QTaDbrM
[06:30:38] <dblosevn> sontek: you want the page to scroll to the bottom as you add elements?
[06:32:04] <sontek> dblosevn: yeah
[06:32:15] <sontek> the container that they are using to dynamically add stuff is that the bottom
[06:32:26] <sontek> so I want to make sure the page keeps scrolling to keep it visible
[06:32:29] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: right I know that, but how do I put $( "#topnav a" ) and $('#topnav a').next('div') together so I can use them in an each function?
[06:32:33] <dblosevn> qvarkk: thats a callback you cant return that to anything its async
[06:32:53] <qvarkk> dblosevn: so there is no way to fetch that value and return?
[06:33:10] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: in the each you would do $(this).next('div');
[06:33:22] <faraway> sontek: $("container selector").animate({ "scroll-top": $("container selector").get(0).scrollHeight },2000);
[06:33:33] <faraway> sontek: if you want to have a smooth scrolling
[06:33:44] <dblosevn> qvarkk: theres nothing to return to... its asyncronous youd be returning to the xhr object
[06:33:57] <qvarkk> dblosevn: ok
[06:34:29] <dblosevn> qvarkk: a better question to ask is what are you trying to accomplish
[06:35:12] <qvarkk> dblosevn: www3.testwebb.nu - i want to keep the images centered
[06:35:15] <qvarkk> vertically
[06:35:34] <qvarkk> and though i'd add margin-top to the image if the max-width is reached and the container is bigger than the image
[06:35:44] <qvarkk> thought*
[06:35:47] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: full code: http://pastebin.com/2tUe0k4a  I want to make it so this works with the first <a> and the <a>'s within the div.
[06:35:49] <sontek> faraway: so in both selectors, "container selector" would be the element I want to scroll to?
[06:35:54] <lac200x> i'm adding dozens of div boxes to my page with jquery. as they keep getting added, i'd like to unload the oldest ones, so the page doesn't get too heavy... which jquery function should i use for this?
[06:36:21] <faraway> sontek: no the selector/element that is scrollable and should be scrolled
[06:36:35] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: make me a fiddle
[06:36:50] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: with some real html
[06:36:54] <hlve> play me a fiddle!
[06:37:00] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: I don't have time sorry, if I did I would
[06:37:15] <ShawnRisk> let me try one now
[06:37:15] <hlve> ShawnRisk, if you don't have time to help us, we don't have time to help you
[06:37:16] <hlve> lol
[06:37:19] <ShawnRisk> lol
[06:37:28] <ShawnRisk> I will try one now as I just got a few more mins
[06:37:40] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: cant really see the problem without having a sample of html
[06:38:22] <dblosevn> qvarkk: how is that even remotely related to the question you asked?
[06:38:40] <sontek> faraway: so just "html" or "body" should work?   I'm trying it but its not working for me
[06:38:58] <qvarkk> dblosevn: 1) the image gets smaller if the screen size/browser window is smaller
[06:39:32] <qvarkk> 2) if the displaying height is equal or higher than the image source height (original height) it means it should be centered. right?
[06:40:29] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: this will not work as it is based on the URL and the URL will never match the links.
[06:40:34] <faraway> sontek: does this work for you ? http://jsfiddle.net/LGqS2/
[06:40:36] <sontek> faraway: Its getting a correct scrollheight but telling it to animate with scrolltop for html doesn't seem to work
[06:40:41] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: do you want me to just make the jsfiddle anyways?
[06:40:57] <dblosevn> qvarkk: =(heightOfContainer - heightOfImage) / 2 == imgTop
[06:41:06] <sontek> faraway: yeah, thats working
[06:41:15] <faraway> sontek: which jquery version do you use ?
[06:41:19] <docmur> if I want to limit draggable object the body of the webpsage I do containment: "body" but when I click the object to move it, it disappers, what is the correct way to bind it to the body
[06:41:24] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: thought you were
[06:41:27] <qvarkk> dblosevn: sure, but then you have the problem with a absolute positioned image, it wont resize properyly in browser etc?
[06:41:50] <dblosevn> it will resize properly just wont move where you want it to go
[06:41:58] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/nBtz6/
[06:41:59] <sontek> faraway: using "body" works, using "html" does not
[06:42:14] <dblosevn> qvarkk: as long as you didnt set a width and height to the abs positioned img
[06:43:00] <faraway> sontek: you should check if this will works in IE, i have never used that on body element, so i'm not sure
[06:43:30] <qvarkk> dblosevn: i dont think i follow :/
[06:43:59] <lac200x> i'm adding dozens of div boxes to my page with jquery. as they keep getting added, i'd like to unload the oldest ones, so the page doesn't get too heavy... which jquery function should i use for this? and can I remove pseudo classes as well?
[06:46:00] <docmur> appendTo was the fix
[06:46:17] <faraway> lac200x: you could use :lt   .. .something like that $(".a-class:lt(5)").remove();
[06:46:44] <lac200x> faraway: for the pseudos? or for all?
[06:47:01] <faraway> lac200x: pseudos ?
[06:47:33] <faraway> lac200x: what do you you mean with removing pseudo classes ?
[06:47:43] <lac200x> faraway: Q was if i can remove pseudo elements as well (as they're def. making page heavier as well)
[06:48:16] <lac200x> faraway: all the div's that I add (and subsequently want to remove) have pseudo css elements added to them (shadows).
[06:48:56] <seutje> I don't think there's currently a way to access pseudo elements
[06:48:58] <lac200x> faraway: so if i remove the div, i wonder if the pseudo elements go as well? will .remove() 'unload' those as well?
[06:49:10] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: any updates?
[06:49:52] <seutje> lac200x: yes
[06:50:03] <lac200x> seutje: that's what I've seen around as well. but I still wonder what they'll do to the page load if the div's they're attached to disappear? (i suppose the visibible 'shadow' will disappear.
[06:50:20] <lac200x> seutje: thanks! great news..
[06:50:39] <lac200x> seutje: in terms of page heaviness as well then?
[06:51:13] <seutje> lac200x: http://jsfiddle.net/X8sHq/ <- poc
[06:51:53] <lac200x> seutje: sweet! thanks a lot!
[06:52:14] <iDen> morning friends
[06:52:30] <hlve> i'm not your friend, buddy!
[06:53:31] <seutje> lac200x: well, it's still a DOM interaction, so there is some load, but since you're stripping shit, the overall weight reduces, I guess
[06:54:46] <iDen> thats okay, i'll still wish you a good morning :)
[06:55:23] <lac200x> seutje: yeah. any tools out there to actually measure the real-time page load in these terms? so i can see what's happening?
[06:56:47] <faraway> lac200x: well chrome has timeline and profiling tools for loading, rendering, painting ... probably you can get your required informations form there
[06:57:22] <Trisox> http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/5635597_700b.jpg lol
[06:57:36] <seutje> lac200x: yeah, webkit dev tools has a decent profiler
[06:57:52] <Trisox> seutje: agreed
[06:58:25] <lac200x_> seutje: really? on chrome? what's it called in pro terms?
[06:58:35] <seutje> "pro terms"?
[06:58:51] <seutje> what's that called in layman's terms?
[06:59:36] <lac200x_> seutje: haha.. the opposite of layman terms i suppose.. but i guess it's the "heap snapshot"
[06:59:53] <seutje> well, depends on what you want to profile
[07:01:00] <Trisox> seutje: serialkillers mainly :D
[07:01:06] <lac200x_> seutje: rather. i def want to know if the pseudo's are really removed or they add up. and i'll do so now - and get back to you ffr.
[07:01:14] <lac200x_> Trisox: lol
[07:01:16] <Trisox> ^^
[07:01:30] <seutje> lac200x_: what do you mean add up?
[07:01:54] <seutje> lac200x_: if the element a pseudo element belongs to is removed, the pseudo element is also gone, by definition
[07:02:07] <seutje> .foo:after <- if there's no .foo, there's no after
[07:02:23] <lac200x_> seutje: ok!
[07:02:56] <seutje> lac200x_: shadow DOM might work differently, but that's a completely different discussion
[07:04:42] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: http://jsfiddle.net/nBtz6/8/
[07:04:46] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: still around?
[07:05:02] <rsmarshall> hey all is it possible to pass a function as a parameter to a function?
[07:05:24] <johnathanb> Like a callback? Yea
[07:05:31] <rsmarshall> Something like function ajax_login(cart_ID, product_ID, passed_function())
[07:05:37] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: that what you were looking for?
[07:06:13] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: pardon?
[07:06:15] <rsmarshall> I'm probably making some rookie error johnathanb, i'll do some more reearch thanks
[07:06:53] <johnathanb> rsmarshall: http://jsfiddle.net/yPghw/
[07:07:39] <rsmarshall> johnathanb, thanks i'll have a play
[07:07:45] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: sorry forgot to click update
[07:08:15] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: http://jsfiddle.net/nBtz6/9/
[07:09:19] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: I want it so if I am on the info page the info submenus will show up all the time, and if  am on the cat page, all the pets subitems will show up too
[07:09:34] <dblosevn> it shoul do that
[07:10:38] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: ill try to test that
[07:11:48] <subdesign> any hint how to change cloned object's name attribute ?
[07:12:06] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: show up as in stick there, and not disappear in hover out.  So if I hover over the items the pets will disappear but come back on hover out if I am on a pet page.
[07:12:33] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: ya I understand
[07:12:39] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: cool
[07:13:04] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: wont work like it is though location.href is absolute and your urls are relative
[07:14:26] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: how will this work?
[07:15:43] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: even if all my links are absolute this will not work?
[07:18:15] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: http://jsfiddle.net/nBtz6/12/
[07:18:22] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: that should work
[07:18:59] <dblosevn> sorry forgot to remove a bit of debug http://jsfiddle.net/nBtz6/13/
[07:21:22] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: on pageload it loops all toplevel a tags in ul#topnav and checks the url to see if it is the current url if it is it adds a class current to the li tag, the css targets ul#topNav li.current div and forces it always to display block
[07:21:29] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: I will try that
[07:22:11] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: make sure to also grab the css
[07:22:45] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: also I added a class to the top level a tags make sure to implement that as well
[07:22:45] <docmur> I'm building a function to generate a div, my issue is that I want to give the buttons as a parameter  so if I have a parameter button can I do in the function buttons: {  button }?  Or how would I do that
[07:23:22] <dblosevn> docmur: could store the parameter in a rel or data attribute
[07:23:45] <dblosevn> docmur: then pull the attribute on click
[07:24:49] <dblosevn> var mybutton $('<button/>').attr('rel', 'myparam').click(callback);
[07:24:50] <docmur> so use $.data("buttons:" , "{ blah}");
[07:24:58] <dblosevn> or that
[07:25:27] <dblosevn> if its only one var i usually just use rel
[07:26:11] <docmur> OKay well I really only need to pass the buttons into the dialog because the buttons will change depeding what I'm doing, everything else can be given using simple parameters
[07:27:18] <dblosevn> in that case id assign each button a rel with an index
[07:27:26] <dblosevn> eg button1 rel=1
[07:27:48] <AzizLight> Hi everybody
[07:28:03] <dblosevn> then on your dialog return return the index of the button that was clicked
[07:28:27] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: still not working out for me.  I tried this on the dev site, nothing happens, and current doesn't get added
[07:28:35] <AzizLight> Can someone tell me why my ".on('click', ...)" function only works once please? http://pastie.org/5084294
[07:28:50] <AzizLight> it works with live but live is deprecated...
[07:29:32] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: trying one more thing
[07:29:57] <rsmarshall> johnathanb still struggling a bit, this is what i'm trying to do (removed a lot of other crap :)) http://jsfiddle.net/Gu2My/
[07:30:30] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: .nav in the jquery code is not needed as I don't have a class like that in my code.
[07:30:43] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: http://jsfiddle.net/nBtz6/15/ works on fiddle
[07:30:58] <ShawnRisk> let me try
[07:31:17] <dblosevn> .nav is need otherwise it targets all a tags in ul topnav
[07:31:21] <dblosevn> *is needed
[07:31:45] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: okay
[07:32:36] <elfenixtorres> hi, just a quick question regarding AJAX. If I retrieve a webpage using AJAX POST and instantiate the returned html string as a JQuery Object it does not become Jquery DOM tree but rather a set of objects with text strings and the like. Any idea how I can circumvent that and make it a jQuery DOM object?
[07:32:43] <johnathanb> dblosevn: To apss a parameter you'd have to do something like that http://jsfiddle.net/Gu2My/1/
[07:32:49] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: usuing the current code it looks for the relative url on fiddle and properly expands the first menu item
[07:33:28] <diginutt> Hello! Is this the appropriate chan to ask dev questions in?
[07:33:43] <dblosevn> johnathanb: question or telling me?
[07:33:45] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: what if I have all absolute urls?  Also what can I do to get the class="nav" but don't want to add that in html wise?
[07:33:53] <johnathanb> elfenixtorres: new_html = $( response_from_ajax ); $( 'body').append( new_html );
[07:34:03] <johnathanb> dblosevn: telling
[07:34:21] <johnathanb> diginutt: yes
[07:34:31] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: you have to have a way to target the first a in ul li a  otherwise your going to have to do a lot more to only get the top level a tags
[07:34:41] <elfenixtorres> johnathanb: thanks, yeah that's the issue $( response_from_ajax ) turns it into a strange object with text strings combined with dom elements. Almost as if the whitespace is converted separately
[07:34:46] <rsmarshall> johnathanb, cheers i think that last one was meant for me not dblosevn :)
[07:35:04] <rsmarshall> trying it not but can't get it to run the test alert yet
[07:35:06] <johnathanb> Ah sorry
[07:35:08] <rsmarshall> erm now*
[07:35:21] <diginutt> Ok. I am having trouble with getJSON. I'm using the .error and .complete handlers from the docs, but the .error keeps getting hit and I don't know why
[07:35:35] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: okay
[07:35:40] <diginutt> I'm doing all local development, but I have a local webserver set up
[07:36:07] <diginutt> Whenever I visit the link for the JSON it displays in the browser
[07:36:16] <xec_> diginutt: do you get any errors in the console?
[07:36:43] <xec_> diginutt: if you're using chrome you might need to change to the network tab to see the request
[07:36:58] <diginutt> Chrome says 192.168.*.* is not allowed by Access-Control-Origin. Firefox says nothing
[07:37:19] <dblosevn> firefox sends an option request @ digginutt
[07:37:23] <johnathanb> rsmarshall: http://jsfiddle.net/Gu2My/3/ stripped it down a little further
[07:37:28] <johnathanb> That's working fine now
[07:37:31] <dblosevn> sounds like your posting to a different orgin
[07:37:47] <johnathanb> rsmarshall: Had a ) out of place
[07:37:50] <dblosevn> diginutt:
[07:38:19] <xec_> diginutt: what's the address in your address bar? "localhost"?
[07:38:32] <rsmarshall> johnathanb, thanks just trying to allow it to be used for more than once case. appreciate your help, i'll go have a play with it
[07:39:03] <johnathanb> rsmarshall: And doe that solution prevent it from being used more than once?
[07:39:31] <dblosevn> diginutt: if your browser is at 192.168.1.1 you cant post to 192.168.1.2 or any other ip or hostname unless you use jsonp
[07:39:47] <diginutt> xec_: I'm on a Mac, so I enabled the web server
[07:39:51] <rsmarshall> johnathanb no was explaining what i'm trying to do with it :) If I change product_ID to param or something generic then i can pass different functions and params in, so works fine :) thanks
[07:40:00] <docmur> can you string to div's to one hide statement so something like div1.div2.hide() to hide both of them
[07:40:10] <diginutt> dblosevn: The service providing the JSON doesn't support JSONP
[07:40:22] <ShawnRisk> dblosevn: I have no more time left, but thanks for your help I will try and make this work later
[07:40:26] <dblosevn> then youll have to create a proxy
[07:40:28] <diginutt> dblosevn: But they're all the same address anyway
[07:40:35] <Already> That's if he didn't put me on ignore.
[07:40:41] <diginutt> It's a local service
[07:40:42] <xec_> diginutt: yes ok. in your browser - make sure the address is the same as the one you're using with $.getJSON()
[07:40:46] <Already> Oh wrong channel.
[07:40:53] <diginutt> xec_: It is
[07:41:07] <dblosevn> ShawnRisk: dont know what the prpoblem is :-( sorry
[07:41:36] <dblosevn> diginutt: what url is in your browser as xec_ already asked
[07:42:01] <xec_> diginutt: what if you try a relative url like $.getJSON("/myJsonPage")
[07:43:20] <diginutt> Just so you guys are aware. I'm working on a client for JPEG2000. It uses a protocol called JPIP. There is a server called Djatoka that my boss has me using to server the information. I have that running locally as well.
[07:43:27] <diginutt> xec_: I will try that now
[07:43:39] <diginutt> Also, I can share my code if that helps
[07:44:28] <elfenixtorres> johnathanb: doing a $.parseXML(data) shows that there's an error at "<script>jQuery.extend(Drupal.settings, {"basePath":"\/","pathPrefix.....
[07:44:44] <ThumperHome> Does 1.8+ support CSS3 transform keys in .animate() ?
[07:46:41] <diginutt> xec_: I don't know that I can do relative. I need to hit port 8080
[07:47:44] <elfenixtorres> gah, this is an annoying parsexml error :/
[07:48:05] <dblosevn> diginutt: you cant send an ajax request to a different port then the request in your browser eg if your browser is @ http://localhost you cant request localhost:8080 with ajax
[07:48:28] <dblosevn> localhost:8080 is a different domain then localhost
[07:48:55] <dblosevn> youll have to create a proxy script to proxy the call
[07:49:14] <diginutt> dblosevn: That sounds like my problem then! Do you have any examples of a proxy script?
[07:49:18] <dblosevn> eg send request /getresult.php
[07:49:59] <rsmarshall> I have a function that currently (not live) passes through user and pass from a form to a php script via an ajax request. Should I encode the password that's passed to the script? It'a a user entered value that isn't confirmed in the js, it's confirmed or denied in the php script after hashing with a salt
[07:50:07] <diginutt> dblosevn: Ahh, I see. Thank you so much!
[07:50:08] <dblosevn> echo file_get_contents('localhost:8080?'.http_build_query($_POST));
[07:50:31] <NoiseEee> rsmarshall: no, you should just use https on both ends
[07:50:38] <rsmarshall> ah thought so, thanks
[07:50:49] <NoiseEee> np
[07:51:08] <dblosevn> diginutt:  echo file_get_contents('http://localhost:8080?'.http_build_query($_POST));
[07:51:24] <dblosevn> diginutt: inside of getresult.php
[07:51:52] <dblosevn> diginutt: also assuming your posting to the proxy replace with $_GET if your sending a get request
[07:59:23] <gabrieluk> hi, I'm reading http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery#Hello_jQuery , and I was wondering what  $(this).addClass("green"); whas refering to. Would it be #orderedlist li:last ?
[08:00:06] <dblosevn> gabrieluk: "#orderedlist li:last
[08:00:53] <gabrieluk> ok
[08:01:08] <dblosevn> gabrieluk: would add the class green to the last li in #orderedlist on hover and remove it oon hover out
[08:01:37] <smftre> I cant figure this out! Can anyone tell me why the jQuery slider isnt working here: http://bit.ly/RHD6aD
[08:02:06] <elfenixtorres> johnathanb: apparently it was just an error in the HTML structure :s
[08:02:24] <johnathanb> elfenixtorres: Glad you got it sorted
[08:02:37] <Saaether> smftre: looks like the range on your slider if from 1 to 1
[08:02:41] <Saaether> is*
[08:02:57] <smftre> Saaether: if you click it, it says "k is null" ? wtf
[08:03:07] <elfenixtorres> johnathanb: yup, thanks mate
[08:03:19] <elfenixtorres> is there a karma bot in this channel?
[08:06:49] <smftre> Saaether: thanks, that guided me in the right direction!

[08:16:21] <zfly9> Hey if anyone can help, I am trying to use this http://lab.smashup.it/flip/ and do a hover to flip it.. It has a function that resets it and I'm trying to do that when you hover off.. http://jsfiddle.net/gVHP9/6/ can't seem to get it right
[08:17:35] <subdesign> how to check if a div contains eg. a button ?
[08:18:12] <faraway> subdesign: $(div).find("button").length
[08:18:19] <subdesign> thx
[08:18:32] <subdesign> give 0 if not found?
[08:18:36] <subdesign> *gives
[08:19:09] <faraway> subdesign: yes .. length is the value of found elements .. so 0 for none
[08:21:13] <Still> zfly9 your still running into the same problem. Did you leave the mouse on the flip thingy? It's flipping endlessly and that's the reason why the revert doesn't work.
[08:22:57] <subdesign> thx worked.
[08:24:52] <zfly9> Still leave the mouse on flip thingy?
[08:25:17] <zfly9> I notice I leave it on there and move the mouse without leaving then yes it flips endlessly
[08:25:31] <zfly9> I would like to get rid of that too.. I am a complete noob to this and would appreciate any help
[08:25:56] <docmur> is there a plugin that allows me to transision a bar layout from stacked where on div is below another to horizontal where the divs are side by side
[08:26:26] <docmur> when I drag the bar to a different position
[08:31:01] <zfly9> Still, any help?
[08:35:34] <Still> Somehow i doubt you can get it to work with a hover.
[08:36:04] <zfly9> any plugin out there for that?
[08:36:11] <zfly9> just want to flip a div with html on each side on hover
[08:37:55] <Already> If you don't have clue what you're actually doing this might be rather hard. Why don't you just supply some links and add the hover to them to change the box?
[08:43:42] <Already> zfly9 http://jsfiddle.net/gVHP9/7/ as you can see with this approach as long as you want to do it on hover your user would have to hover that object until the animation has finished. If he leaves the object before the animation is finished it breaks. So probably there is a bug in that "flippy" thingy or you're trying to use it in a way it's not intended.
[08:44:29] <majd> hey #jquery - i'm trying to handle events on click for a dialog button, but i keep getting an error a in this example: http://jsfiddle.net/majdal/6fNfF/
[08:45:04] <zfly9> Already ahh I see
[08:45:32] <majd> how should  be configuring the button to work?
[08:50:26] <anew> can i just echo a json response directly or do i have to put it in arrays ? i.e. can  i echo "{success:SUCCESS, response:true}";
[08:52:01] <freeed> anew, yeah.. that's the same as echoing json_encode($array);
[08:52:27] <freeed> anew, though the format should be more like: {"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d":4,"e":5}
[08:52:50] <anew> hah sweet jesus it works
[08:52:54] <anew> thaks freeed
[08:52:59] <freeed> :)
[08:53:00] <anew> sittig here trying to make fkn arrays all day
[08:53:04] <dblosevn> anew: using the example I gave you earlier would have worked with one line of cde
[08:53:05] <anew> echoing so much easier
[08:53:34] <dblosevn> anew: [10:51] <dblosevn> diginutt:  echo file_get_contents('http://localhost:8080?'.http_build_query($_POST));
[08:54:22] <zfly9> Already, can you make it so that instead of hovering I just click it
[08:54:31] <zfly9> and it flips, without that link at the bottom, actually clicking the div
[08:55:52] <jwmann> So #wordpress sent me here. I have 2 plugins that use jQuery but they're conflicting with each other. Is there anything I can do to prevent this?
[08:57:48] <Already> I'd say it depens on why they conflict jwmann
[08:57:50] * Gx4 Have a nice weekend all! :)
[08:58:11] <Already> So you don't want to learn jquery/programming zfly9? :P
[08:58:56] <jwmann> Already: He's the console http://d.pr/i/ODez/3PmtjmCO
[09:00:44] <Already> ThatÄs not helping in the slights. There is some kind of error. Probably something, somwhere tried to convert a value for whatever reason and failed. What are the plugins supposed to do?
[09:00:53] <Already> Ä = '
[09:01:45] <Already> zfly9 http://api.jquery.com/click/ and you need a variable to "decide" whenever or not to call revert or flip.
[09:02:17] <jwmann> Already: They're both slider type plugins
[09:02:57] <jwmann> Already: One is called NivoSlider, basically your average slideshow and the other is a widget which is a basic basic slideshow
[09:04:34] <jwmann> Already: This widget has the jquery-ui but oddly the console breaks on jquery.min yet the widget that use the jquery-ui breaks
[09:04:44] <green-_> i'm trying to use jquery UI's slide functionality to hide/show a fixed position div … but it slides it relative to it's enclosing element in the markup as opposed to the window as a whole, seemingly ignoring the fixed positioning. anyone know any way to produce the desired behavior?
[09:06:30] <Already> jwmann jquery ui depends on jquery and that slideshow depens on both and uses both.
[09:06:38] <jwmann> Okay
[09:06:46] <Already> Did you make sure that the widget breaks it?
[09:07:16] <jwmann> Already: No, I'm not sure. I added NivoSlider but the widget is the one that stopped working
[09:08:29] <freeed> jwmann, do you see any javascript errors in the Chrome dev console or in Firebug? Can you post links to the unminified versions of both plugins?
[09:08:31] <anew> gah when everything works it's the best thing ever
[09:09:16] <jwmann> freeed: This is what Chrome console gives me http://d.pr/i/ODez/3PmtjmCO
[09:09:37] <docmur> what is the right way to do this:  pastebin.com/vfzbXqRV  I'm not seeing the <input> Im appending
[09:10:04] <jwmann> I'll upload the js of the plugins (minus the jQuery files)
[09:10:32] <MalMen> with jquery-ui buttons my float divs stay on back.. anyway to solve this ?
[09:10:39] <Already> docmur add a closing > to input?`
[09:11:09] <Already> right now you're creating a "<input type=text id=chat512873 value=178245" tag
[09:11:16] <docmur> wow ya totalyl missed that
[09:11:18] <docmur> thanks!
[09:11:30] <jwmann> freeed: This is the widget (the one that broke after adding nivoslider) http://d.pr/f/QPZD/3SrftPjb
[09:12:14] <green-_> to my knowledge, jquery doesn't make it a habit of ignoring CSS when positioning things, I'm not clear why it is in this case
[09:12:31] <freeed> jwmann, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2079115/uncaught-typeerror-property-of-object-object-global-is-not-a-function
[09:12:49] <jwmann> freeed: And this is the nivoslider http://d.pr/f/PDhS/2kePCSM0
[09:12:52] <Already> If the widget works maybe that nivoslider has some kind of issue? Did you try to disable the widget but keep niveoslider? Does nivoslider work jwmann?
[09:13:13] <green-_> i also can't find any other reference of this via google. seems hard to believe.
[09:13:29] <jwmann> Already: They both work independently.
[09:16:25] <jwmann> freeed: I don't the link you posted is relevant to mine. The person here is just missing the dependancy
[09:17:14] <freeed> jwmann, the voted awnser had the same error :\ Maybe jquery ui isn't getting to one of the plugins for some odd reason.. *shrug*
[09:19:07] <jwmann> freeed: The error seems to happen right when it first tries to slide something
[09:21:47] <jwmann> freeed: Actually I think the error might be unrelated. I disabled the NivoSlider and the widget works and the error in the console remains.
[09:23:17] <jwmann> Wait scratch that
[09:23:34] <jwmann> No the error is gone when Nivo Slider is gone
[09:26:39] <Ai__> hey guys.. anyone here have an idea how can i send the value of an autocomplete selected to my database?
[09:28:05] <jwmann> freeed: NivoSlider adds code that make jQuery.noConflict()
[09:28:44] <mwmnj> Hey all, I am trying to make a facebook style textbox list. For some reason the width of the li element keeps changing
[09:28:45] <mwmnj> http://jsbin.com/iwuniz/38/edit
[09:28:53] <mwmnj> Anyone able to take a peek?
[09:34:41] <MalMen> how can i apply jquery-ui style to all form elements ?
[09:45:19] <LiquidL> hi, i am a web jquery/web n00b. I was wondering do I have to include jquery on every webpage of my site that uses or is there a way to include it once (e.g. in index.htm) and have it available to any all other webpages on the site?
[09:45:53] <NoiseEee> LiquidL: wherever you use it, it needs to be included.
[09:46:50] <LiquidL> NoiseEee: ok cool, do most browsers usually cache the copy or will it be re-downloaded each time?
[09:49:23] <scar> how can i fade out 2 things at once?
[09:49:36] <scar> besides putting the 2 items the same class
[09:49:44] <scar> is there a way to do two consecutive .fadeOuts at once?
[09:50:35] <green-_> hmm..  evidently jquery UI ditches the box-shadow on an element as it slides it, too
[09:50:37] <johnkpaul> scar: $('.thing1').fadeOut(); $('.thing2').fadeOut() will start the fade at the same time
[09:51:20] <gcpeters> scar, I believe $.when($('#elem1').fadeOut(), $('#elem2').fadeOut()).then(function() {}) will allow you to fade them out at the same time and provide a single call back when both are done
[09:53:08] <scar> johnkpaul, gcpeters thank you both. appreciate the single callback :)
[09:54:59] <scar> gcpeters im assuming i can provide params within the fadeOut function inside the .when() ?
[09:55:30] <gcpeters> scar you can pass in all the normal function params
[09:55:50] <scar> k perfect. of course i would leave out the callback function, since im using this methoid
[09:55:53] <scar> method
[09:56:03] <zfly9> hey guys I have this jQuery flip and I can't get it to revert back http://jsfiddle.net/gVHP9/8/
[09:56:24] <zfly9> I want that on the second click it goes back to the other side.. and $("#flipbox").revertFlip() is supposed to do it
[09:57:09] <gcpeters> yeah, you can just pass the duration and easing
[09:57:50] <zfly9> sorry, http://jsfiddle.net/gVHP9/9/
[10:16:49] <docmur> if I have div.find('button').click(function(event){ how do I figure out which of two buttons ( remove, add ) were clicked with out doing another click check
[10:19:19] <caleb_io> docmur event.target should tell you iirc
[10:19:37] <docmur> so do if( event.target '== "remove")?
[10:19:54] <caleb_io> no, event.target is going to return the element that you clickedon.  Does remove have a class of remove?
[10:19:58] <mwmnj> Hey anyone know why this is trying to post?
[10:19:58] <mwmnj> http://jsfiddle.net/yPP8b/1/
[10:20:00] <caleb_io> or id of remove, or how is it?
[10:20:18] <mwmnj> *GET
[10:20:19] <docmur> The ID would be remove
[10:21:04] <caleb_io> then you could do if( $(event.target).attr('id') == 'remove' )
[10:21:57] <zfly9> Can anyone help? Trying ot make this flip box flip on click then revert back to it's other side on a second click http://jsfiddle.net/gVHP9/10/
[10:23:44] <caleb_io> zfly9, could do sort of a flip toggle..
[10:23:59] <caleb_io> on click if it has a class of "flipped", remove the class and flip it.   If it doesn't have the class, add the class and flip it.
[10:24:20] <zfly9> caleb_io to be honest I was trying to copy code and figure it out, but I'm pretty new to this
[10:26:22] <caleb_io> zfly9 let me gist it.
[10:26:30] <Ai__> hey guys.. anyone here have an idea how can i send the value of an autocomplete selected to my database?
[10:26:58] <caleb_io> zfly9 https://gist.github.com/3919476
[10:27:47] <zfly9> wow I love you!
[10:28:19] <caleb_io> did it work?
[10:28:22] <caleb_io> it worked for me in JSfiddle.
[10:28:27] <caleb_io> you could do it more elegant using toggleClass
[10:29:15] <zfly9> what would be the difference?
[10:29:42] <caleb_io> not much, it all accomplishes the same.
[10:29:55] <caleb_io> now that I think of it, it wouldn't be more beneficial
[10:30:18] <Ai__> ?
[10:30:19] <zfly9> ok great
[10:30:31] <zfly9> if I have a few of these divs can I use classes?
[10:30:50] <caleb_io> yep, and then just change the # to .
[10:30:55] <zfly9> sweet
[10:31:03] <caleb_io> since I used $(this) it will only flip the one that is selected vs. looking for #flipbox
[10:31:05] <zfly9> just wasn't sure if it was going to be confused on which was was already flipped etc
[10:33:00] <wachpwnski> how do you create a div on the dom with and id and class?
[10:33:23] <zfly9> caleb_io actually I probably need ID's since it uses content:'this is my new content' to put content on the other side
[10:33:32] <zfly9> so I just duplicate you code for each one ya?
[10:33:51] <NoiseEee> wachpwnski: $('<div id="myDiv" class="sandwich">').appendTo(someOtherDOMElement)
[10:33:57] <jwmann> BAH I need help T________T
[10:35:12] <Ai__> damn why this keep on scrolling up automatically
[10:35:36] <Ai__> anyone here have an idea how can i send the value of an autocomplete selected to my database?
[10:36:36] <MrPunkin> Can anyone offer the best way when using something like hogan.js or mustache.js to figure out which template to use for the current page URL? The url can be dynamic with element id's such as /photos/1234 and thus probably regex is required
[10:38:49] <Saaether> zfly9: you could just do something like this http://jsfiddle.net/gVHP9/11/ then you dont need to duplicate anything
[10:39:37] <zfly9> Saaether wow that's awesome
[10:39:44] <zfly9> I need to have a lot of html tho
[10:39:58] <zfly9> is there anyway it can call another div or something
[10:40:23] <Saaether> would need an example to know what you're talking about =)
[10:40:47] <Saaether> or atleast explain it abit more
[10:41:57] <zfly9> like have <div class="font-side">Front HTML</div> <div class="back-side">Back HTML</div>
[10:44:41] <Saaether> so you'd want to load your flip using data from other divs on the page?
[10:45:34] <mwmnj> Hello
[10:45:38] <zfly9> Saaether yup
[10:45:44] <mwmnj> Could anyone check something for me real quick?
[10:45:45] <mwmnj> http://jsbin.com/epuzug/1/edit
[10:45:46] <zfly9> I'd basically have 4 sets of those
[10:46:15] <mwmnj> Could anyone click the x in the output and tell me the result?
[10:48:14] <yekta> Hello, I've got $.fn.sortable upon which when run my function $('.sortable').sortable(); I get my function, when my DOM changes is it safe to just run my function again so it includes the newly added DOM elements or is there a way in which I can unbind that funciton?
[10:50:08] <JFranks> Does anyone else notice a problem with the date that gets set on this form: http://jsfiddle.net/ZMe77/1/ ?
[10:50:36] <jwmann> Can someone help me with a jQuery conflict between 2 plugins?
[10:50:53] <JFranks> Ahhh latest JQuery UI is 'yy' = 'yyyy'
[10:53:29] <Saaether> zfly9: ok so would something like this work? http://jsfiddle.net/gVHP9/12/
[10:55:11] <zfly9> you are simply a genius!
[10:55:30] <Ai__> how can i send an id instead of whatever value the jquery autocomplete sets
[10:55:39] <zfly9> I don't suppose you can magically make that so it flips on hover and goes back on remove hover
[10:55:43] <zfly9> ;)
[10:55:47] <zfly9> pushing my limits?!
[10:57:23] <JFranks> onMouseover="$( this.id ).toggle('fast');"
[10:57:48] <JFranks> Oops wasn't looking... ;)
[10:58:23] <inad922> hello
[10:58:37] <inad922> Is there anyone here who is familiar with jquery datatables?
[10:59:00] <Ai__> inad922:  what do u need
[10:59:36] <wachpwnski> how do you load the contents of a div into another div? I tried $('#load_to').load('#load_from')
[11:00:13] <versatile> ? $.append
[11:00:15] <bot-t> versatile, .append() - Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[11:01:01] <Taar779_w> .prop('checked') always returns true when checking to see if a radio button is checked on a click event (with adn without using e.preventDefault()). Is there some default behavour that I'm not aware of?
[11:02:33] <inad922> Ai__: I would like to attach a function to it which retrieves new elements via an ajax call. Since on the backend we are using external resources as well which needs like some kind of range passed so like "I want the elements from element 20 to 100" or something like that. How can I do this? Since I only saw hardcoded ajax calls to a given address. or does it send some kind of params? I didn't really see the documentation on that.
[11:02:44] <versatile> try .is(":checked")
[11:02:56] <jwmann> Can someone help me with a jQuery conflict between 2 plugins?
[11:04:05] <Saaether> zfly9: cant get the flip to play nicely with hover
[11:04:16] <zfly9> no worries
[11:04:33] <zfly9> I'm trying to create 4 boxes like this but it only seems to take the first
[11:04:39] <Taar779_w> versatile: yields the same results.
[11:04:50] <gcpeters> jwmann: what plugins?
[11:05:54] <jwmann> gcpeters: They're wordpress plugins. One plugin uses noConflict() and the other uses jQuery instead of '$'
[11:06:03] <Saaether> zfly9: http://jsfiddle.net/gVHP9/13/
[11:07:27] <zfly9> wow
[11:07:28] <zfly9> just wow
[11:07:29] <gcpeters> jwmann: what's the conflict? we have the same situation on our wp site, we use no conflict, some plugins use jQuery
[11:07:51] <vedic> I am using slideToggle() to open up search options. It works good on IE7,8 and FF and Chrome but on Safari, it slides down for 1/2 sec and then slides up again.
[11:09:02] <jwmann> gcpeters: This is what the console gives me: Uncaught TypeError: Property '#<Object>' of object #<Object> is not a function  -- jquery.min.js:16
[11:09:37] <Theowning> I'm trying to use postMessage between a page and an iFrame, I can send the message to the frame, and the event pops. For some reason though, the parent window won
[11:09:44] <Theowning> I press enter too soon, gj me
[11:09:48] <vedic> What could be the issue if slideToggle() doesn't slids down fully and in the mid way slids up again. This issue I am facing on Safari. IE, FF and Chrome work good
[11:10:17] <Theowning> I'm trying to use postMessage between a page and an iFrame, I can send the message to the frame, and the event pops. For some reason though, the parent window won't bind the message event, any ideas on how to debug this?
[11:11:01] <lethjakman_work> Hey, I'm looking at a method in a program I was going to use, and I was wondering what this was called.
[11:11:13] <lethjakman_work> https://gist.github.com/bcaaa68e09ae1facbbe8
[11:11:29] <lethjakman_work> I'm talking specifically where it has a test: function () {},
[11:11:46] <gcpeters> jwmann: what are the names of the wp plugins? are they available for dl or did you write them?
[11:11:52] <lethjakman_work> Is that basiaclly an object? Is that a jquery thing, or a javascript thing?
[11:11:54] <mi6_x3m> hello is $(window) == $("window") ?
[11:12:12] <NoiseEee> lethjakman_work: just an object :)
[11:12:22] <lethjakman_work> cool! I wasn't aware you could make them that way
[11:12:53] <lethjakman_work> thanks
[11:13:06] <docmur> What are the units on left and top returned from position, I'm gettling Left: 100, top: 130
[11:13:29] <nchlssmith1> mi6_x3m: No
[11:13:46] <jwmann> gcpeters: I have 2 plugins. http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/smart-slideshow-widget/ and http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nivo-slider-for-wordpress/  -- There is a jQuery conflict between the 2 and the smart-slideshow-widget loads but the animations break
[11:13:58] <mi6_x3m> nchlssmith1: how come
[11:14:14] <jwmann> gcpeters: They both work independent of each other.
[11:14:20] <nchlssmith1> window is a key word like docuemnt
[11:17:48] <zfly9> Saaether there's some weird animation when it reverts
[11:18:16] <zfly9> http://tolaw.highrankdev.com/ left sidebar of the page, the blue boxes
[11:18:50] <nchlssmith1> mi6_x3m: I take it back it seems that "document" and document act exactly the same.
[11:19:01] * jugstah is away. Automatically set away [SZon]
[11:19:03] <mi6_x3m> nchlssmith1: yeah I just tested myself as way
[11:19:11] <mi6_x3m> anyway, I got it to work :)
[11:19:16] <nchlssmith1> good
[11:20:28] <Saaether> hmm ya that is kind of odd
[11:21:33] <Saaether> zfly9 my guess would be that its caused by using an image as the background
[11:21:38] <jugstah> I have a setInterval with two setTimeouts inside of it
[11:21:55] <jugstah> don't think its good practice.
[11:22:24] <zfly9> Saaether ahh you're prob right
[11:22:28] <Theowning> Anyone know why an event wouldn't bind? even though the syntax is correct?
[11:23:29] <beachandbytes> Theowning whats the code look like
[11:23:51] <beachandbytes> something else catching the event?
[11:24:02] <jwmann> gcpeters: I can give you a live website to see the problem?
[11:24:04] <Theowning> $(window).bind("message",function(event){console.log(event);});
[11:24:14] <Theowning> Just that, sitting inside a script tag
[11:24:27] <Theowning> It works if I past it into the firebug console
[11:24:31] <gcpeters> jwmann would be great
[11:24:49] <vedic> In Safari, slideDown('slow') and slideUp('slow')  both are happending one after the another even if I call only slideDown('slow'). If works fine in IE, FF, Chrome
[11:24:49] <jwmann> gcpeters: I'll PM the credentials
[11:24:55] <Theowning> There is a similar event in an ifram on the page
[11:24:56] <vedic> What could be the problem?
[11:25:05] <Theowning> iframe*
[11:25:18] <anew_> what's a good jquery plugin u guys are using for file uploads
[11:25:26] <gcpeters> jwmann cool
[11:25:27] <Theowning> but I don't think it's causing the conflict seeing as how the code works in FB
[11:26:06] <jwmann> gcpeters: Broken slide-show is the sponsor's logos and the other plugin is just underneath it(nivoslider)
[11:27:32] <Theowning> god dammit
[11:27:37] <Theowning> beachandbytes: I figured it out
[11:27:52] <MiracleBlue> Theowning: What was it?
[11:27:54] <Theowning> It's a collab project I'm working on with someone else
[11:28:08] <Theowning> they copied the script tag from somewhere
[11:28:34] <Theowning> It had copyrighter's quotes around text/javascript instead of real quotes
[11:28:42] <MiracleBlue> Oooh
[11:28:45] <MiracleBlue> Hahaha
[11:28:57] <Theowning> :(
[11:29:07] <Theowning> I just spent like 30 minutes debugging that
[11:29:11] <MiracleBlue> Man, I hate that.  I get that problem when emailing colleagues at work in outlook.
[11:29:25] <Saaether> zfly9 its not caused by the image,, but what ever is causing it, it isnt jumping out at me
[11:29:32] <eip56> Been there done that i feel your pain
[11:30:17] <MiracleBlue> Copyrighters quotes should be made illegal
[11:30:31] <MiracleBlue> When I inevitably become emperor of earth, that will be my first order of business
[11:32:19] <Ai__> sv
[11:33:56] <gcpeters> jwmann: is the slide show plugin dependent on the slider plugin?
[11:34:15] <zfly9> Saaether seems like there is a gray color called in the plugin
[11:34:32] <zfly9> still not sure why it looks weird tho but I need to dig for it and change that brb
[11:34:33] <jwmann> gcpeters: No, they work independently.
[11:34:39] <gcpeters> ok, thanks
[11:36:09] <MiracleBlue> Hey Lucky--
[11:36:16] <zfly9> saaether haha nevermind can't seem to find any hex code in there haha
[11:41:23] <docmur> if I want to usee div.css({top: 85%, left: 87%}); in JQ do I have to quote the % value
[11:42:33] <robgleeson> docmur: yes.
[11:43:16] <zfly9> saaether apparently we are supposed to use this $("#flipbox").revertFlip() to revert
[11:43:20] <zfly9> you think that'll help
[11:43:58] <Saaether> we do..
[11:44:06] <Saaether> $(this).revertFlip()
[11:44:47] <lethjakman_work> docmur: you can also add the quote to whatever number you want if you want to use a variable.
[11:45:14] <lethjakman_work> div.css({top: y + '%', left: x + '%'});
[11:47:02] <Saaether> zfly9 trying to replicate the issue on jfiddle and i cant get it to happen
[11:47:03] <Saaether> http://jsfiddle.net/gVHP9/16/
[11:48:01] <paradoxquine> is there any way to fire $.callbacks such that all the callbacks fire asynchronously?
[11:48:59] <zfly9> Saaether http://jsfiddle.net/gVHP9/17/
[11:49:24] <trinque> is it possible to use jquery to traverse a document object I've instantiated with document.implementation.createDocument?
[11:50:10] <gcpeters> jwmann: sorry, no luck so far, still looking
[11:51:44] <Saaether> zfly9, i see whats causing it, .flipbox.flipped in your css
[11:51:52] <Saaether> the background changes is whats messing it up
[11:51:53] <inad922> with jquery datatables how do I know on the serverside which rows shall I send back?
[11:52:22] <zfly9> hmm good catch
[11:52:30] <zfly9> is there a way to get what I want without that?
[11:56:07] <Saaether> zfly9, http://jsfiddle.net/gVHP9/18/ gets your closer
[11:56:11] <Saaether> but the color is abit off
[11:59:50] <jwmann> gcpeters: Okay, Really appreciate the help
[12:00:54] <zfly9> saaether what'd you change?
[12:01:15] <Saaether> i took off the !important which is what was glitching it out
[12:01:29] <Saaether> but then its not picking up the correct color
[12:02:03] <jedimind> PANIC
[12:02:06] <jedimind> also ask #css ?
[12:03:01] <gcpeters> jwmann: I do see that jquery is being included twice in your source, once in the <head> (ver 1.7.2) and once at the bottom (ver 1.5.1), looks like the nivo slider plugin is hardcoding a reference to ver 1.5.1
[12:03:41] <Saaether> zfly9, http://jsfiddle.net/gVHP9/19/ BAM
[12:03:44] <jwmann> gcpeters: Yea, in the head I see jquery.js and the bottom has jquery.min.js
[12:03:54] <gcpeters> jwmann: look in nivoslider4wp-show.php.php line 33 and comment out the script tag for jquery, see if that works
[12:04:05] <jwmann> gcpeters: I think the one the in head is used for wordpress
[12:04:10] <jwmann> gcpeters: Kay Ill try
[12:04:30] <gcpeters> jwmann, kind of a shot in the dark, but might help, 1.5.1 is a little old
[12:04:41] <jwmann> kk
[12:04:57] <gcpeters> jwmann plugin should be using wp_enque_script() rather than hard coding the tag
[12:05:59] <zfly9> Saaether you are ridiuculous
[12:06:02] <zfly9> what'd you change?
[12:06:06] <MrPunkin> What's the proper way to bind the this element reference when calling another jQuery plugin method from the one actually called on the element, is it .apply?
[12:06:22] <Saaether> need to set the flip color in the js function instead of setting it in the flipped class
[12:09:35] <zfly9> Saether so you didn't change any css?
[12:09:56] <zfly9> just trying to see what to copy back over
[12:10:15] <jwmann> gcpeters: You. Fixed. it.
[12:10:29] <jwmann> *biggest sigh of relief*
[12:10:33] <gcpeters> jwmann: sweet!
[12:10:34] <jwmann> THANK YOU!
[12:10:41] <gcpeters> glad to help
[12:11:00] <jwmann> That was a big shot in the dark in my mind too and it worked and I was like "DA FUQ??? WHO CARES IT WORKED!!"
[12:11:11] <jwmann> :D
[12:11:24] <sl0ppy> i'm attempting to fix a website bug for someone and i can't seem to figure it out
[12:11:27] <sl0ppy> http://pastebin.com/R87RGNFv
[12:11:27] <gcpeters> Yep, sometimes shots in the dark work
[12:11:30] <gcpeters> :)
[12:11:31] <sl0ppy> when changePage is called to select another language
[12:11:35] <sl0ppy> it breaks the .click function
[12:11:36] <Saaether> zfly9,  only change you need to make in the css is to take out the background-color line in the .flipbox.flipped
[12:11:41] <sl0ppy> although in the firebug console the function is still there are referring properly to the element
[12:11:45] <sl0ppy> it just doesnt fire
[12:11:46] <zfly9> I just copied it all Saaether haha
[12:11:53] <zfly9> Man you're a genius
[12:12:16] <Saaether> was a fun challenge on a friday, better then doing my own work heh
[12:14:51] <brend_> u guys know how to pass values using the autocomplete?
[12:16:54] <jugstah> anyone got a minute to take a look at my sloppy code? I'm not too keen on loops so hoping someone can help me real quick:
[12:16:58] <jugstah> http://jsfiddle.net/2Vf9T/10/
[12:17:30] <jugstah> basically, need this to fire 5 seconds after doc.ready and then keep looping(open curtain, close curtain with 5 secs in between open/close.
[12:18:04] <jugstah> poor use of settimeout and setinterval, i know.
[12:19:16] <beachandbytes> http://jsfiddle.net/2Vf9T/11/
[12:20:03] <docmur> I'm trying to make a gmail / facebook style chat where you click a chat button and the chat block pops up but then if you click another chat button, another box pops up this is my logic / code, I can't seem to get a second box to pop up http://jsfiddle.net/PPZTg/11/
[12:20:15] <jugstah> thx.. need it to wait five secs after opening before closing the curtains again?
[12:21:17] <myrman> docmur: not sure what you mean by that description
[12:22:28] <docmur> Okay,so right now I have a bar with multiple chat buttons on it connected to multiple users.  When you click a chat button a chat window appears, when you click the next chat button I want a new chat window to appear next to the open window so you get a series of open chat boxes next to each other
[12:22:45] <bigLanky> How can i Make the menu choices seen on http://occasion.team4.ciplex.com/restaurants/10 look like this ajax/jquery selector? ---> http://screencast.com/t/u35Zo5ue
[12:22:51] <bigLanky> anyone know of a jquery plugin that can do this?
[12:25:17] <myrman> docmur: your code has an error. Check the console. Change the closing bracket } for the click event to });
[12:25:30] <myrman> http://jsfiddle.net/PPZTg/12/
[12:26:46] <docmur> okay thanks :-) but do I have the "logic" right?
[12:27:12] <beachandbytes> jugstah
[12:27:21] <jugstah> sup?
[12:27:31] <beachandbytes> its just your interval timer is shorter then total time in settimeouts
[12:27:49] <jugstah> yeah I know.. this isnt the right way to do it I know that much
[12:27:55] <jugstah> just don't know how to properly chain events
[12:29:40] <zfly9> Saether last question, haha, is it possible to not have it flip when I click the link that's in the flipped side?

[12:29:54] <myrman> docmur: I still don't know what you're doing. Does clicking "Chat" open a new chat window for each click?
[12:30:04] <fold> <span onclick="console.log(\"ok\");"​>ok</span>​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
[12:30:11] <fold> why doesn't this work when I click ok
[12:30:12] <docmur> it should
[12:30:15] <Saaether> ummm
[12:30:22] <docmur> I'm alittle unsure as to why it wont
[12:30:23] <zfly9> prob not right
[12:30:57] <docmur> if the chat div is closed it should open it, if one is open it should place a second div next to it
[12:31:14] <Saaether> maybe
[12:31:21] <Saaether> let me try something

[12:37:31] <jugstah> beach - a quadrillion thanks!
[12:37:42] <jugstah> ;-)
[12:38:55] <beachandbytes> i might have the functions named backwards
[12:40:37] <jugstah> so this is how you separate out the events
[12:40:47] <jugstah> learned something new
[12:42:59] <docmur> I'm trying to make it like this: http://www.flickr.com/photos/88895880@N02/8103486554/
[12:47:15] <Noctifer> I am applying jqueryui theme (ui-darkness i think) using
[12:47:16] <Noctifer> <script>$(function(){ $('select#TheSelect').selectmenu(); });</script>
[12:47:18] <Noctifer> Is there a similar call for buttons, input[type="text"], ... and other form elements?
[12:47:38] <Noctifer> i.e. the selectmenu styling works perfectly but how to do that for other form elements?
[12:51:16] <Saaether> any one else having issues with jsfiddle being extremely slow?
[12:51:23] <myrman> Yes
[12:51:24] <scar> so now i just gotta figure out jquery through the js so i can learn when to not use jquery
[12:51:33] <scar> any tips?
[12:51:40] <Noctifer> ok it works for buttons using ".button()"; but what is the call for input[type=....]
[12:53:55] <beachandbytes> $('input:text')
[12:54:02] <Saaether> zfly9, sorry js fiddle died so i had to give up
[12:54:42] <zfly9> ah damn
[12:54:47] <zfly9> no worries thanks for your effor
[12:54:47] <zfly9> t
[12:55:47] <myrman> docmur: still there?
[12:56:00] <docmur> yep
[12:56:04] <Saaether> zfly9, and now its working again
[12:56:05] <Saaether> http://jsfiddle.net/gVHP9/20/
[12:56:11] <myrman> I'm sorry, bit drunk so not entirely sure I'm being helpful but this is my approach http://jsfiddle.net/PPZTg/15/
[12:56:16] <myrman> Using more css than JavaScript
[12:56:20] <docmur> I have the box moving so I just have to figure out how to make it cloneo over
[12:56:50] <Otineb> hello. Is anyone familiar with the validate() jquery function? I'm looking to target an input by name but the basic script targets by id. I don't have access to the form code to add an id plus I'm new to javascript. Here's the reference page I'm using. http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Methods/email
[12:58:03] <zfly9> Saaether SWEET just put in that line on the js?
[12:59:08] <Saaether> make sure you add the event object to the function $('.flipbox').click(function(e) { and ya then just wrap the code in the if
[12:59:19] <scar> Otineb: maybe use .find() with .attr('name') ??
[12:59:29] <scar> just a guess. if you can use .find to target an attr
[12:59:43] <Saaether> any ways, off for the day, take care folks
[12:59:56] <zfly9> Saaether crap that broke it on my site
[13:00:02] <Saaether> ?
[13:00:14] <zfly9> just copied the js over and it doesn't flip
[13:00:25] <scar> Otineb: try $('input[name='myName']')
[13:01:26] <Saaether> hmm
[13:01:54] <Saaether> did everything work before the change?
[13:01:59] <Saaether> i see some other errors in the console
[13:02:05] <Saaether> regarding a datepicekr
[13:02:08] <zfly9> yeah they did
[13:03:21] <zfly9> ah wtf went back to the old one and still not wroking
[13:03:23] <zfly9> working
[13:03:34] <Saaether> ya something else is causing those errors
[13:03:46] <Saaether> unfortunetly i have to go, good luck
[13:08:55] <ShawnRisk> I am still stuck with this: http://jsfiddle.net/nBtz6/15/ and the urls are all absolute so they are http://example.com/blog/ but I didn't put them that way sorry.  What I am stuck on is if I click the subitems on my dev site, the top menu item and the subitems don't stay on.  Any ideas?
[13:15:12] <beachandbytes> not sure exactly what you mean ShawnRisk
[13:17:35] <ShawnRisk> beachandbytes: If I click on the top link which is Info or Pets, the sublinks show up and the top link is highlighted.  If I click the sublinks blog or cat, the toplink is not highlighted and the sublinks are not shown.  How do I make them shown?
[13:22:11] <TelFiRE> is there a way to disable selection with jQuery? I see disableSelection() in jQuery UI but would prefer not to rely on UI
[13:23:15] <imanc1> hey folks I need to style some custom select boxes and I'm wondering if there's a suitable/recommend jquery plugin. I'm looking to achieve this effect/style: http://i.imgur.com/MWgdX.png
[13:23:35] <beachandbytes> http://jsfiddle.net/nBtz6/19/ ShawnRisk update fiddle with actual problem
[13:24:36] <beachandbytes> imanc1 kendo ui has a nice one
[13:24:41] <ShawnRisk> beachandbytes: thanks but how is this different?
[13:24:52] <beachandbytes> its not, im just saying i dont see the problem you describe
[13:24:57] <beachandbytes> menus show on hover, and dont disappear
[13:25:17] <imanc1> beachandbytes: thanks
[13:25:46] <beachandbytes> select2 is another one
[13:27:02] <imanc1> kendo ui is by telerik? looks like a commercial solution
[13:27:16] <beachandbytes> no its open source
[13:27:28] <ShawnRisk> beachandbytes: what happens:  If I click info and load that page, the sublinks show up and the toplink is highlighted.  If I click blog and that page loads, the sublink don't show up and the toplink is not highlighted.
[13:28:10] <beachandbytes> http://www.kendoui.com/download.aspx open source version on the right
[13:28:49] <brend_> any ideas about how to pass an id value using an autocomplete?
[13:30:10] <beachandbytes> use a dictionary<key,string> to populate autocomplete
[13:30:28] <beachandbytes> err dictionary<InputText,key>
[13:31:32] <beachandbytes> or use combobox and select list
[13:31:42] <brend_> other than that ill have to use dropdown which will be ugly
[13:32:58] <qvarkk> hi! can someone find a logical reason for the jquery script when click on the text below the picture not working in IE7/IE8 - http://jespermoe.com.preview.binero.se/galleri/stenbrottet/
[13:33:09] <brend_> beachandbytes:  i can load the autocomplete.. but i want to pass an id instead of the text selected
[13:33:14] <qvarkk> "...for the jquery script not working..."*
[13:34:04] <beachandbytes> brend_ thats what ime saying either use an dictionary to lookup the value after you have the autocomplete text, or use a selectlist so you have the value already attached
[13:34:04] <lethjakman_work> hey, I'm working with some jquery, and I'd like to get the height of a div with an overflow of type scroll. Is there any way of doing it?
[13:34:11] <lethjakman_work> my real goal is to load more when it reaches the bottom
[13:34:58] <beachandbytes> lethjakman_work just monitor scroll position
[13:35:24] <lethjakman_work> beachandbytes: what method would I use for that?
[13:35:50] <Absolute0> How can I submit a form using the DELETE or PUT method?
[13:36:29] <ShawnRisk> beachandbytes: do you understand?
[13:37:17] <brend_> beachandbytes:  using an input hidden would be available also?
[13:37:23] <beachandbytes> lethjakman_work scrollTop
[13:37:58] <lethjakman_work> beachandbytes: thank you!
[13:38:06] <beachandbytes> np
[13:38:23] <beachandbytes> ShawnRisk, ya but without a problem on fiddle its tough to say
[13:38:26] <beachandbytes> how are you loading the page
[13:39:55] <NoiseEee> ShawnRisk: you should be able to debug this yourself.
[13:39:57] <brend_> dblosevn:
[13:40:08] <NoiseEee> ShawnRisk: asking someone to debug that is demanding a heck of a lot from someone
[13:40:11] <brend_> this dude should know
[13:40:26] <NoiseEee> ShawnRisk: use console.log, the only reason 'things are happening' is because they;ve been programmed to do so.

[13:41:46] <brend_> beachandbytes:  u know where i can get an example of what u say?
[13:42:49] <kkdue> <kkuno> hi I have a problem
[13:42:49] <kkdue> <kkuno> I have a div with fixed height and overflow hidden
[13:43:08] <kkdue> I need a way to determine which element is at the bottom of the div
[13:43:28] <kkdue> in other words, which element is "cut" by the overflow
[13:44:10] <ShawnRisk> NoiseEee: okay
[13:44:24] <jugstah> .last would find you the last element in a collection
[13:45:14] <kkdue> jugglinmike, yeah but it would return the last element, which is hidden
[13:45:23] <kkdue> I want the last element shown
[13:45:30] <jugglinmike> jugstah: ^^
[13:48:12] <beachandbytes> brend_ give me one second ill throw together an example
[13:48:52] <brend_> beachandbytes:  ok thanks
[13:50:31] <kkdue> like this
[13:50:31] <kkdue> http://jsfiddle.net/qzmUC/
[13:50:51] <kkdue> I want a script that returns 12
[13:53:43] <jugstah> use .find
[13:55:13] <jugstah> kkdue- try here might help: http://www.codeterrorizer.com/jquery/simple-example-on-how-to-search-a-list-with-jquery
[13:57:19] <jugstah> good weekend, people. til next week.
[13:57:54] <Absolute0> How to the ajax request instead of simply loading it?
[13:57:59] <Otineb> peace out jugglinmike
[13:58:49] <Absolute0> http://pastie.org/5085992 <-- i'd like to redirect to the page loaded by the request instead of making and ajax request
[14:00:31] <shoky> Absolute0: you mean, a regular form submit?
[14:00:36] <Absolute0> yeah
[14:00:53] <shoky> then.. remove that whole paste.. no?
[14:01:00] <Absolute0> that script allows me to submit PUT AND DELETE forms
[14:01:05] <shoky> oh
[14:01:14] <shoky> regular html forms don't support PUT and DELETE
[14:01:25] <shoky> you can only do those with ajax afaik
[14:01:34] <csdco> Is there a way to change the priority in which a click handler is called?
[14:01:56] <csdco> so if 2 functions are bound to the mousedown event for an item, I can force the 2nd function to be run before the 1st function?
[14:03:07] <kkdue> ok solved
[14:03:15] <kkdue> I have to get element position
[14:03:23] <kkdue> and compare it with the parent height
[14:04:26] <SrPx> What is a javascript code that will load jQuery? I don't know how to load scripts with js without jQuery. Not sure if this is a #javascript or #jquery question.
[14:04:43] <SrPx> (from google)
[14:05:42] <kkdue> SrPx, you have to append the script to head I think
[14:05:54] <brend_> beachandbytes:  im trying to set an example but is kinda confusing
[14:06:05] <SrPx> Yes, probably. But how? And how to add a callback to when it is loaded?
[14:06:14] <kkdue> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5791279/jquery-getscript-vs-document-createelementscript
[14:06:32] <kkdue> the callback function should be a bit complicated
[14:06:37] <kkdue> don't know how to do it
[14:06:52] <cods> I don't understand: I've $("td").data("spec") == '1', but $("td[data-spec='1']") return no elements. How is that possible? How can I find element by data value?
[14:07:16] <SrPx> kkdue: should I just do a setTimeout then
[14:07:23] <SrPx> kkdue: and thanks
[14:07:24] <jugglinmike> cods: jQuery stores data in memory
[14:07:28] <jugglinmike> on elements
[14:07:38] <kkdue> using timeout is a bad workaround
[14:07:48] <jugglinmike> so if you set that up with $("td").data("spec", 1), it will not be on the element
[14:08:13] <jugglinmike> You can use your browser's developer tools to verify that the element does not have a "data-spec" attribute in that case
[14:08:31] <cods> jugglinmike: that's right. I had to install a plugin for firebug to see the data attributes.
[14:08:47] <cods> jugglinmike: so you mean that I can select this way, I've to use .filter() maybe instead?
[14:08:57] <shoky> data-* attributes are only read from the element the first time you call .data()
[14:08:59] <cods> jugglinmike: oops, that I can't*
[14:09:05] <shoky> and they are never written to by jquery
[14:09:09] <jugglinmike> If you want to later retrieve the element with a css selector, you'll have to explicitly create a data- attribute with $("td").attr("data-spec" , 1)
[14:09:14] <NoiseEee> exit
[14:09:32] <jugglinmike> But I would recommend keeping a reference to the element in memory if you are going to use it again later
[14:09:44] <jugglinmike> DOM lookups are expensive
[14:09:49] <cods> actually, I'm adding these data from jquery (the entire page is built by javascript)
[14:10:11] <cods> hmm
[14:10:24] <brend_> brb
[14:10:45] <cods> an object to reference them would be better actually.. Good point.
[14:11:21] <jugglinmike> alright good luck cods, I'm off
[14:11:28] <cods> thanks
[14:11:37] <jugglinmike> np

[14:25:08] <smftre> any thoughts?
[14:26:01] <FrameFever> I am connected to a mousedown event of a div, but this div has another DIV A as overlay, when this div A will be clicked, I don't want to be informed
[14:26:03] <FrameFever> how can I do this?
[14:28:30] <smftre> FrameFever: $("#yourAnchor").click(function(e){ e.stopPropagation(); });
[14:30:03] <madmn> I have 2 divs, one that is directly under another one, and the one under the div on top, the .hover() function does not work for it. Is there any way I can have a function with hover that can see if there are div's placed under, so i can pick it. It is for basically doing z-index user interactively, I want to be able to pick div's under others. ty
[14:30:45] <beachandbytes> have the div above trigger the other hover
[14:31:07] <madmn> i cant pick the order the div's are placed
[14:31:18] <madmn> as they are created dynamically by the user
[14:32:14] <FrameFever> smftre: I want to stop this info at first place
[14:32:18] <jastor> so add a array .. where the index are added as the divs are added
[14:32:29] <jastor> madmn*
[14:32:53] <jastor> just joined ;) have no idea what youre after
[14:33:02] <FrameFever> smftre: that mean, the outer div should not be informed as first message handler
[14:33:15] <madmn> jastor, you entered before I added any msgs, you saw what I all wrote
[14:33:26] <jastor> kk
[14:33:41] <madmn> a user add's divs, and moves em around with .draggable.. but now they have placed on top of another, and they can no longer pick it
[14:33:51] <madmn> a user add's divs, and moves em around with .draggable.. but now they have placed on top of another, and they can no longer pick it
[14:34:21] <jastor> doesnt the draggable ui have method for determin the order?
[14:34:29] <jastor> (i havent used ui much)
[14:34:41] <madmn> dont know.. I am just trying to find a solution
[14:35:07] <jastor> check on he jqueryui.com site or #jqueryui ( #jquery-ui ? )
[14:35:27] <jastor> on the*
[14:35:53] <madmn> mind you.. I could have an option to 'push to back' type option, and just change the z-index -1 .. might work
[14:36:05] <jastor> that could work
[14:36:50] <madmn> worth a shot.. i'll try it
[14:37:09] <jastor> madmn: z-index equal index
[14:37:14] <brend_> beachandbytes: i got it?
[14:37:43] <FrameFever> can anybody help me?
[14:37:55] <imanc1> only god can help you
[14:37:58] <jastor> FrameFever: dont ask to ask
[14:38:06] <beachandbytes> brend_ http://jsfiddle.net/EBduF/272/
[14:38:08] <FrameFever> jastor: I asked already
[14:38:15] <jastor> ah .. sorry about that one then ;)
[14:38:41] <jastor> FrameFever: it seems i missed parts of your question
[14:38:49] <FrameFever> I am connected to mousedown and mouseup
[14:39:08] <FrameFever> now I have a outer div and a inner div
[14:39:12] <brend_> beachandbytes:  why im not able to see the example in jsfiddle?
[14:39:20] <Already> Could anyone recommend a validator for my html/css/js source?
[14:39:29] <lmat> I'm very new to jquery. I see a jQuery.extend(Drupal.settings, {
[14:39:33] <lmat> And the { isn't matched! Is this bad?
[14:39:43] <FrameFever> now I want to get informed only when the mouse is on the outerdiv
[14:39:55] <FrameFever> not on the innerdiv
[14:40:24] <FrameFever> how to do this?
[14:40:27] <Already> I'm not sure about the construct but are you sure the { isn't matched lmat? If not it should lead to an error.
[14:40:28] <FrameFever> jastor: any hint?
[14:41:13] <jastor> FrameFever: .... to be honest your question didnt make much sense to me .. you have a outer div and outer div .. and mousedown doenst trigger on the innerdiv?
[14:41:31] <Dragon707> http://jsfiddle.net/DmTZt/1/ Does someone knows how i can get the value of hte inputs ?
[14:41:32] <jastor> outer and inner*
[14:41:39] <FrameFever> it makes pretty sense
[14:41:50] <FrameFever> I explain it better
[14:41:56] <FrameFever> take a look at the example of http://api.jquery.com/mouseover/
[14:43:05] <brend_> wtf is going on with jsfiddle
[14:43:05] <smftre> FrameFever: you need to use propagation events
[14:43:19] <FrameFever> when the mouse cursor is over the inner div, the green one, then I want to get informed that the mouse is no more on the outer div
[14:43:23] <jastor> FrameFever: ah .. now it makes more sense .. i just had to read your question like 10 times first
[14:43:30] * jastor blames the celltoxins
[14:43:42] <beachandbytes> brend im not sure shows up for me :)
[14:43:55] <brend_> ok
[14:44:10] <brend_> is the damn browser.. it got cached
[14:44:29] <FrameFever> smftre: yeah, but I need it for my case in the first place
[14:44:56] <FrameFever> I am connected to "body"
[14:45:01] <Dragon707> http://jsfiddle.net/DmTZt/1/ Does someone knows how i can get the value of hte inputs ?
[14:45:10] <imanc1> can anyone advise how you'd do progressive enhancement on a html select list?  Is it best to remove the item from the dom when instantiating the custom list object?
[14:46:02] <beachandbytes> imanc1 adding and removing items from the select list?
[14:46:15] <FrameFever> jastor: so what do you think?
[14:46:57] <brend_> beachandbytes:  that seems to be the best solution.. thanks man
[14:46:58] <jastor> FrameFever: withou wasting my already wasted brain right now $(outer).on("mouseover",funtion() { valid=true; checkValid(); });   $(inner).on("mouseover",funcion() { valid=false; });
[14:47:30] <jastor> over,enter,out,leave,whatever
[14:50:49] <FrameFever> jastor: what is "CheckValid()"?
[14:50:56] <imanc1> beachandbytes: I'm basically replacing the entire select list with a custom version I'm buidling (http://i.imgur.com/MWgdX.png). So I'll need to remove or hide the originla html select list
[14:51:23] <jastor> FrameFever: random function of yours with stuff you want to run when youre over the outer div
[14:51:32] <MrPunkin> Anyone here well familiar with the HTML history API? I'm curious about storing the state object to return back to without having to re-run AJAX on a page they have already visited.
[14:51:50] <FrameFever> jastor: you solution doesnt make any sense to me
[14:51:54] <FrameFever> sorry
[14:52:08] <jastor> FrameFever: mmm it probably wouldnt work either
[14:52:17] <jastor> there are better solutions i just know it

[14:52:58] <jastor> FrameFever: yaaaaay brain capacity
[14:53:05] <FrameFever> take less
[14:53:13] <beachandbytes> imanc1 if your using a library like kendoui etc it will take care of the hiding for you

[14:54:00] <beachandbytes> np Dragon707
[14:54:58] <FrameFever> jastor: do you really has not to pay anything when you are going to the doctors in UK?
[14:55:05] <FrameFever> +have
[14:55:22] <jastor> FrameFever: what i meant wiht my solution was ... whenever you enter the outer .. set a variable to true and run a function to check if this variable is true, run the stuff you want to run  .. if you enter the inner, set this variable to false
[14:55:31] <jastor> like i said... it wont work
[14:55:48] <jastor> FrameFever: no idea ive never been to a english hospial
[14:55:53] <jastor> or scotish
[14:55:57] <jastor> or northern ireland
[14:56:00] <FrameFever> whare are you from?
[14:56:03] <jastor> sweden
[14:56:10] <jastor> we dont pay much either
[14:56:25] <jastor> like 12$ a day
[14:56:33] <jastor> while admitted to a hospial
[14:56:44] <jastor> for every hospital stuff needed
[14:56:57] <robgleeson> you pay in taxes too.
[14:56:57] <madmn> jastor, that worked like a charm.. funny how somethings are just too simple, you ver think them :)
[14:57:08] <madmn> over think
[14:57:09] <jastor> not couning certain privae hospitals (you know like high end stuff that the best friend of the king would visit)
[14:57:12] <razzi> Jastor how much does a webdeveloper ship a month in UK?
[14:57:29] <jastor> razzi: no idea
[14:57:43] <jastor> i dont live in 3 countries either
[14:57:48] <razzi> Jastor, give or take a few british pounds
[14:58:26] <jastor> razzi: let me grab the GBP->SEK converter first
[14:59:40] <FrameFever> how is the event handling done in jquery?
[14:59:41] <jastor> 2200£?
[14:59:53] <jastor> i have no idea
[15:00:04] <FrameFever> when I click a inner div, is then at first the inner div informed and then the outer
[15:00:08] <FrameFever> or otherwise?
[15:00:10] <imanc1> web devs do between £25 and say £45 for a senior in the UK
[15:00:15] <imanc1> 25k that is
[15:00:22] <imanc1> freelancers earn a load more
[15:00:30] <madmn> imanc1, really?
[15:00:33] <jastor> 25000£ a month???
[15:00:37] <imanc1> £60k p/a is not difficult as a freealncer
[15:00:45] <imanc1> a year
[15:00:52] <imanc1> 25k a year
[15:00:54] <jastor> imanc1: razzi asked per month
[15:00:57] <imanc1> oh
[15:01:00] <madmn> depends where ya live too, I am sure
[15:01:03] <jastor> :D
[15:01:08] <imanc1> way to find out …
[15:01:10] <imanc1> www.cwjobs.co.uk
[15:01:12] <jastor> yup ;)

[15:01:26] <beachandbytes> better solution
[15:01:50] <Dragon707> Thx :D
[15:01:55] <Dragon707> Youre awesome guys :D
[15:01:57] <imanc1> i don't see a huge difference between London and Manchester, except in London you get the odd high payer, e.g. £450 per day for a python dev
[15:02:25] <madmn> I just live in a small town in Canada, I get payed pretty well tho
[15:03:03] <imanc1> I know a guy who works in Wisconsin, US and he seems to get a really good full time income that is similar to my freelance income
[15:03:11] <razzi> dang .. 450 a day ? seriousl y?
[15:03:30] <imanc1> yep
[15:03:37] <robgleeson> pounds.
[15:03:43] <systemfault> Yeah right...
[15:03:51] <beachandbytes> must be a damn good python dev

[15:04:12] <robgleeson> Ruby is better anyway! hah.
[15:04:27] <imanc1> pfft
[15:04:30] <imanc1> python ftw
[15:04:33] <robgleeson> :)
[15:04:41] <robgleeson> I don't stick to one language.
[15:04:45] <razzi> i hate python and i hate ruby
[15:04:49] <madmn> must cost a lot to live in London tho
[15:04:52] <robgleeson> I like C#, Ruby, JS, & Go.
[15:05:08] <imanc1> madmn: yeh, definitely. Many live in shared houses
[15:05:12] <robgleeson> Python is okay but honestly it defeats the same problems as ruby so it is not that interesting.
[15:05:13] <systemfault> Only hippies like Go :/
[15:05:34] <imanc1> robgleeson: you haven't looked at it properly then. It's a fantastic language.
[15:05:47] <madmn> imanc1, whats average rent for a flat? say like 800sqft
[15:05:54] <oojacoboo> anyone have any ideas on why this animation isn't working… http://jsfiddle.net/3zZqS/1/
[15:06:02] <robgleeson> imanc1: maybe. :)
[15:06:03] <imanc1> well, my buddy rents out a flat in Cricklewood, North West London
[15:06:05] <imanc1> zone 3
[15:06:10] <imanc1> not a great place, but passable
[15:06:18] <robgleeson> imanc1: I have too many languages on my plate that i'm more interested in. :)
[15:06:22] <imanc1> he's letting his flat for about £1500 a month
[15:06:26] <madmn> wow...
[15:06:35] <madmn> so ya, you need to make that kind of money :)
[15:06:42] <imanc1> I can let the same type of flat in manc city centre (right in the centre) for about £700 pcm
[15:06:57] <madmn> I live cheap :)
[15:07:09] <imanc1> madmn: plus there's all the commuting - it's fairly normal to spend two hours getting too and from work
[15:07:10] <robgleeson> i live in the netherlands but im originally from ireland.
[15:07:23] <robgleeson> life is way cheaper here. :)
[15:07:31] <imanc1> I'd live in Ireland - i hear it's become cheaper over the past few years
[15:07:31] <oojacoboo> is this about jquery?
[15:07:36] <imanc1> Dubiln, that is
[15:07:47] <madmn> ya, dutchland is cheap, but Canada is even cheaper :)
[15:07:54] <robgleeson> imanc1: yeah, from really really terrible to really terrible.
[15:07:58] <robgleeson> it is still a rip off :p
[15:08:06] <imanc1> ha ha
[15:08:48] <madmn> in pounds, I pay about 400 a month, for my townhouse , and thats own, not rent
[15:09:11] <robgleeson> I'd never live in england tho.
[15:09:22] <robgleeson> it is the most dull place you could go, and evidence: jermely kyle.
[15:09:25] <madmn> me neither, and not in Holland anymore either. nty
[15:09:38] <madmn> got a lot of family there
[15:09:39] <robgleeson> jeremy*
[15:10:06] <robgleeson> holland is cool.
[15:10:24] <robgleeson> i dont like their winter too much but ireland is just as bad :)
[15:10:25] <madmn> its small :)
[15:10:48] <robgleeson> yeah.
[15:10:51] <robgleeson> well, its unique.
[15:10:59] <madmn> but then, anything is small compared to Canada :)
[15:11:03] <oojacoboo> is this #renting?
[15:11:12] <oojacoboo> or about jquery
[15:11:18] <madmn> oojacoboo, yes
[15:11:26] <robgleeson> oojacoboo: no one is talking.
[15:11:28] <oojacoboo> ah, might I recommend #defocus
[15:11:53] <oojacoboo> I asked a question, of course it gets buried in London rental rates ;)
[15:11:53] <madmn> oojacoboo, you are more then welcome to ask a q
[15:12:04] <oojacoboo> anyone have any ideas on why this animation isn't working… http://jsfiddle.net/3zZqS/1/
[15:13:03] <madmn> anyways, I am done
[15:13:29] <robgleeson> oojacoboo: interesting piece of code but sorry i cant see the cause.
[15:14:17] <imanc1> robgleeson: Jeremy Kyle has been exporting his trash to the US tho
[15:14:30] <robgleeson> imanc1: hah, true!
[15:14:41] <oojacoboo> no, focus on my question! :P
[15:14:49] <oojacoboo> don't #defocus
[15:14:53] <robgleeson> =)
[15:16:40] <beachandbytes> oojacoboo http://jsfiddle.net/3zZqS/2/
[15:17:14] <beachandbytes> standard jquery animate won't animate properties that are not numeric
[15:18:46] <oojacoboo> beachandbytes: I see what you did, but am not trying that to what you're saying
[15:18:49] <oojacoboo> thanks btw
[15:19:37] <oojacoboo> can you please elaborate :)
[15:19:46] <beachandbytes> you can animate width etc because its numeric
[15:19:58] <beachandbytes> background-color is not numeric
[15:20:14] <oojacoboo> ah, gotcha, so why did the edit you make cause the animate to work then?
[15:20:28] <beachandbytes> I added the color library to jquery.animate in the resources
[15:20:35] <oojacoboo> and also, why did this work in jq 1.7 but not 1.8
[15:21:02] <oojacoboo> beachandbytes: oh, I see
[15:24:27] <qvarkk> can someone find out why the jquery click events are not working in IE8/IE7 - http://jespermoe.com.preview.binero.se/galleri/testtavla/
[15:28:10] <oojacoboo> beachandbytes: it looks like the issue is that 1.8 doesn't utilize this color code from jquery ui
[15:28:23] <oojacoboo> is there a strong decoupling that was introduced as part of 1.8?
[15:40:05] <black_warlock> hello guys
[15:40:20] <black_warlock> im including a jsfiddle script into my blog

[15:40:39] <black_warlock> somebody knows how to open the view on the result window ?
[15:42:56] <Aristata> Anyone here have a clue how the hell you get bootstrap carousel to only switch slides when the user clicks?
[15:45:21] <beachandbytes> Aristata set interval to null
[15:45:30] <Aristata> Tried that
[15:45:32] <Aristata> And to false
[15:45:47] <Aristata> http://pastie.org/5086456
[15:46:07] <Aristata> Is it because I am initializing it again on a particular slide when the user clicks an image?
[15:46:11] <Aristata> I can't imaging that would be
[15:46:22] <Aristata> I have tried it on the individual frame initialization as well
[15:46:24] <Aristata> No luck
[15:47:44] <Aristata> Tried this number to: $("#carousel").carousel(parseInt(t.attr('data-index')), {interval: false, cycle: false})
[15:47:58] <Aristata> The damn thing wont'stop cycling like crackhead
[15:48:06] <Aristata> Is just cycles faster and faster
[15:48:20] <Aristata> Far and away the absolute worst gallery plugin I have ever used
[16:05:38] <rsumi> i used jQuery('#item').hover(); to set an event when i mouse over an item and mouse out. is there a way to trigger the mouse out event via js manually?
[16:06:04] <beachandbytes> .trigger
[16:07:21] <rsumi> beachandbytes: what would be the mouse out trigger for hover?
[16:07:56] <beachandbytes> mouseout
[16:08:02] <beachandbytes> .trigger('mouseout');
[16:11:03] <Beeton> Hi there, I'm trying to trigger a click event but am not having much luck. I have a bunch of SVG <g> elements which have an onclick event which works when I click it, but when I try $('#node-id').click() it doesn't do anything
[16:15:07] <beachandbytes> Beeton do you have an example
[16:15:26] <beachandbytes> $('#node-id').trigger('click');
[16:15:27] <Beeton> not immediately to hand, can put something up on jsfiddle though
[16:15:46] <beachandbytes> try that
[16:15:59] <Beeton> yeah, been trying that. It returns the jquery object so I know I have the right id, but the click event doesn't happen
[16:16:34] <beachandbytes> if you debug inside the click event you never get there?
[16:16:37] <MrPunkin> Is there any way to queue events in jQuery?
[16:18:50] <beachandbytes> MrPunkin yes
[16:18:59] <beachandbytes> callbacks make it easy
[16:19:11] <MrPunkin> just found promise() for this type of stuff too
[16:20:06] <Beeton> nope MrPunkin, it never makes it
[16:20:39] <MrPunkin> Beeton: it never makes what?
[16:20:49] <Beeton> into the onclick handler
[16:21:20] <MrPunkin> Beeton: I was referencing my own issue, sorry. Didn't intend it as an answer to yours.
[16:21:34] <beachandbytes> Beeton can you put an example up
[16:21:37] <Beeton> ok no worries :)
[16:21:37] <beachandbytes> on fiddle
[16:21:42] <Beeton> yeah just a minute
[16:29:07] <Beeton> hmm, having trouble recreating the problem in fiddle, it works there :P
[16:29:23] <Beeton> I'm using D3, wonder if it interferes in some way
[16:30:57] <Lucky--> BAHAHHAHAH http://www.thedailybeast.com/galleries/2012/10/17/11-best-and-worst-binders-full-of-women-memes.html#introSlide
[16:38:44] <ogk1000> anyone care to give me feedback on a simple cool animation im working on?
[16:39:20] <ogk1000> playing with various .stop(T/F) combinations to minimize the glitch.. can't seem to get it perect
[16:39:50] <Beeton> ok, I messed around with someone else's D3 example on jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/wFq9q/
[16:40:03] <Beeton> it should pop up three alerts, stating before, 23, after
[16:40:08] <Beeton> but the 23 one doesn't happen
[16:40:41] <Beeton> maybe D3 handles events differently to jQuery?
[16:41:49] <Milos|Work__> If I have $('.some-class').mouseup(someEvent); how would I make it so that event only happens for .some-class that has any children that are input boxes?
[16:42:30] <Beeton> Milos: maybe check inside the handler if there are any input children?
[16:43:01] <Milos|Work__> I was thinking more of an appropriate use of .filter(:not:has
[16:43:27] <ogk1000> $(.some-class).has("input") ?
[16:43:34] <ogk1000> if ( )

[16:53:36] <baps> If I use a jquery carousel plugin, how can I reference the instance of that plugin? I'm trying to use jShowOff, but have separate buttons to skip to specific slides via its goToAndPause function.
[16:53:51] <beachandbytes> Milos|Work__ use a custom function in filter(
[16:55:08] <Milos|Work__> beachandbytes, I worked it out - thanks.
[17:02:50] <beachandbytes> Beeton
[17:03:01] <Beeton> hiya, think I've found a workaround

[17:03:10] <beachandbytes> from so

[17:21:30] <Muimi> in the 'output' when I put them into the 'input'
[17:24:36] <baps> Any ideas how I can reference the jShowOff instance in this example to call a function on it? http://jsfiddle.net/b2wNR/4/
[17:29:00] <baps> Muimi: Like this? http://jsfiddle.net/hD8CF/4/
[17:31:03] <Muimi> nah i can't do newlines in the input there
[17:31:13] <Muimi> shift+enter
[17:31:19] <Muimi> b/c it's a single-line input maybe

[17:54:27] <Ai_> hey i was trying some code like this to send the id of the autocomplete to the server, however im stuck in the id part http://jsfiddle.net/EBduF/275/
[17:59:13] <BinaryKitten> Ai_ dunno what the issue is, but as a heads up $(item)[0].item.value; = pointless
[17:59:25] <BinaryKitten> item.item.value = not pointless
[17:59:48] <Ai_> umm im kinda confuse
[18:00:45] <Ai_> BinaryKitten:  theres not an issue.. i just was wondering how to use that example sending data to the server
[18:00:59] <BinaryKitten> working on that
[18:01:12] <BinaryKitten> but please pay head to my comment..
[18:01:32] <BinaryKitten> what you're doing is wrapping the item in jquery and then doing [0] which gets that item out again
[18:01:44] <BinaryKitten> which is a pointless round trip in code
[18:02:33] <Ai_> BinaryKitten:  right.. im following
[18:03:43] <BinaryKitten> Ai_ on top of that you could use .data
[18:04:05] <BinaryKitten> eg $(elem).data('id', theIdVar);
[18:04:34] <BinaryKitten> and $(elem).data('id') to retrieve
[18:07:32] <BinaryKitten> Ai iff that doesn't work, then sorry can't help more
[18:07:39] <BinaryKitten> it's 20:07 and i need to sleep
[18:08:24] <Ai_> BinaryKitten:  doing this i can get the results in my autocomplete.. but how can i send the id in the input hidden? http://jsfiddle.net/EBduF/277/
[18:23:04] <Milos|Work_> If I do something like
[18:23:16] <Milos|Work_> $item.children('input:last-child').bind('keyup', function() { ...
[18:23:23] <Milos|Work_> and I want to unbind it in that function
[18:23:32] <Milos|Work_> is there a shortcut to referencing the thing being bound?
[18:23:41] <Milos|Work_> or do I have to write $item.children('input:last-child').unbind('keyup')
[18:29:52] <Ontology> Ohai
[18:30:02] <kickandrew> Ontology: sup
[18:31:01] <sahbeewah> Milos|Work_: there's no shortcut. use whatever selector gets you the element... note that you are unbinding all keyup event handlers from it
[18:31:14] <sahbeewah> you should use a named function, so you can unbind the same function
[18:31:23] <Milos|Work_> that's fine
[18:31:26] <Milos|Work_> that's what I want
[18:31:27] <Milos|Work_> thanks
[18:31:54] <YammYcoding> hi. what is this notation about? #!prettyPhoto/6/   this 6 means what? anybody knows?
[18:32:24] <Milos|Work_> uh
[18:32:26] <Milos|Work_> the 6th photo maybe
[18:33:07] <YammYcoding> it's used to show content instead of photos
[18:33:21] <YammYcoding> sometimes it works, and when gets to the /6/ the popup doesnt open
[18:33:43] <YammYcoding> i wonder if this 6 means something in the code , some flag or variable or something
[18:34:10] <Milos|Work_> we certainly wouldn't know, you're not providing any code
[18:34:37] <YammYcoding> it's that prettyPhoto lib, not a custom thing
[18:40:27] <Milos|Work_> YammYcoding, you'll need to be more specific about anything otherwise we can't help, why are you adding a 6 anyway
[18:45:16] <YammYcoding> i'm searching the docs
[19:11:17] <fruitwerks> hey all... anyone know of any jq that can parse a google contacts feed?
[19:17:49] <YammYcoding> okey i guessi have a question now. At the end of url i have this: #!prettyPhoto/6/  Can i somehow tell javascript to search for a /prettyPhoto/ string and read the number after it? with this, I can call the function i need
[19:21:25] <coldhead> var photoid = window.location.hash.match( /prettyPhoto\/(\d+)/ )[0]
[19:21:55] <coldhead> ?eval '#!prettyPhoto/789/'.match( /prettyPhoto\/(\d+)/ )[0]
[19:21:59] <bot-t> coldhead: "prettyPhoto/789"
[19:22:03] <coldhead> er

[19:27:59] <YammYcoding> nice! i will test it here, this might fit it =D
[19:28:23] <coldhead> good luck YammYcoding
[19:32:43] <YammYcoding> hmm you're good with that uh!
[19:33:11] <YammYcoding> what if i want to find just the string #pretty , instead ?
[19:33:26] <YammYcoding> is match( /#pretty\ ) ?
[19:33:42] <YammYcoding> match( /#pretty\ )[0] ?
[19:36:36] <YammYcoding> ?eval 'pretty'.match( /pretty\ )[0]
[19:36:37] <bot-t> YammYcoding: SyntaxError: unterminated regular expression literal
[19:36:48] <YammYcoding> ?eval 'pretty'.match( /pretty/ )[0]

[19:36:53] <YammYcoding> aah
[19:37:01] <YammYcoding> ?eval '#pretty'.match( /pretty/ )[0]

[20:40:55] <mohadib> hello
[20:42:22] <mohadib> can select elements be serialized? I'm trying $("select option:selected").serialize()  but getting an empty string in chromes console. How can I serialize the selected values of all select elements? thanks
[20:42:45] <Milos|Work_> If I have
[20:42:53] <Milos|Work_> $item.children('input') which returns two elements
[20:43:04] <Milos|Work_> how do I display their value in .each?
[20:43:06] <Milos|Work_> like
[20:43:34] <Milos|Work_> $item.children('input').each(function() { return "<li>" + $(this).val() + "</li>"; }); doesn't do it
[20:46:34] <mohadib> ah, i needed the name attr, all is well now :S
[20:50:17] <Milos|Work_> never mind it was working but not all in one line, I don't think I can use return like that or something
[21:28:12] <GoSox> I just used jquery.rotate to make one of those rotating progress indicator icons. It rotates the image 30 degrees every 100 ms. It actually is working really well too. I'm wondering, is there any reason why this might not be a good idea? Or is something like this fine to do?
[21:29:07] <orangey> hello all!
[21:29:21] <orangey> I'm looking for something akin to high charts (data visualization with jquery / js), but GPL
[21:29:22] <orangey> any thoughts?
[21:29:32] <orangey> I see many, many, but not sure which is best
[21:30:43] <coldhead> i always try to use flot.js
[21:30:50] <coldhead> because it's pure and simple
[21:31:37] <slavka``> hey guys... any reason why the following responses arent been cached... ive pastebinned >>> http://pastebin.com/6Aq6EYsG
[21:33:20] <orangey> coldhead: thank you
[21:33:22] <orangey> just looking at flot now
[21:33:24] <orangey> looks pretty good.
[21:33:35] <orangey> sadly, not as comprehensive as highcharts
[21:41:41] <orangey> I think I'm going to go for D3
[21:45:59] <thinkerweb> Hi
[21:46:35] <thinkerweb> I wonder, is it possible to animate background image movements, like margins,
[21:51:42] <orangey> using R?
[21:51:48] <orangey> errr. using what?
[21:51:58] <orangey> sorry. wrong channel ; )
[21:55:09] <maxaud1> I'm adding content to a <div> using .html(), the "onload" event doesn't seem to fire on these elements when I'm adding them to the <div>.
[21:55:09] <maxaud1> How can I watch these elements for when a certain type of element is being loaded into it?
[21:57:05] <thinkerweb> maybe live() or on()
[21:58:34] <maxaud1> thinkerweb, how would you construct a function that watches an element for another element using live or on?
[21:59:43] <thinkerweb> post it on jsfiddle
[22:02:47] <sahbeewah> you can't do that reliably
[22:02:52] <beachandbytes> $('#parentElement').on('click', '.childElements', function () { alert($(this).val()); });
[22:02:53] <sahbeewah> it's called a mutation event
[22:03:02] <sahbeewah> work around it
[22:09:03] <defaultro> how would you guys implement multiple language support?
[23:49:23] <thinkerweb> I wanna select any siblings whose class name is so-and-so
[23:49:41] <coldhead> ?siblings
[23:49:41] <bot-t> .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[23:49:55] <coldhead> .siblings('.some_class')
[23:51:48] <thinkerweb> cold it didn't work for me
[23:52:00] <thinkerweb> $(this).siblings(".lowerleftlist").show();.
[23:54:42] <thinkerweb> after this I have an ul's an h, p, ul, and then my .lowerleftlist ul
