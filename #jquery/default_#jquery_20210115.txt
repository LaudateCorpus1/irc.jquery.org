[14:05:06] <morenoh11> is there a way to get $.ajax to recieve and download a file on success?
[14:05:26] <morenoh11> my server is sending back a file with status 200 but $.ajax enters the error callback.
[14:05:39] <robertmaxrees> can you show the code?
[14:07:14] <admin123> robertmaxrees: it enters the error cb https://dpaste.com/2ANNRCE7T#line-87 even though the api is returning a file with status code 200 L42
[14:08:08] <robertmaxrees> so you're returning a file.
[14:08:22] <admin123> yep
[14:08:46] <robertmaxrees> your first issue is the dataType property.
[14:08:58] <robertmaxrees> "The type of data that you're expecting back from the server. If none is specified, jQuery will try to infer it based on the MIME type of the response"
[14:09:20] <admin123> I want to issue the request with ajax, and I want the browser to download the zip file. I don't want to store the zip on disk, so as soon as its delivered it should be garbage collected.
[14:09:43] <robertmaxrees> i would start by removing dataType
[14:11:39] <admin123> robertmaxrees: nice now its entering the success cb
[14:12:24] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/23797348/923919 for the other steps
[14:55:26] <admin123> robertmaxrees: do you happen to know what the correct Blob type is for a zip file?
[14:55:43] <admin123> I don't think its application/zip
[14:56:11] <robertmaxrees> client or server?
[14:57:20] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/7027582/923919 for the server
[14:57:28] <robertmaxrees> admin123
[15:01:21] <admin123> robertmaxrees: client, this https://dpaste.org/jvq7 downloads a zip but it won't open, the zip is not empty
[15:02:15] <robertmaxrees> reread my first link.  you need the xhrFields property with the responseType set to 'blob'
[15:02:25] <robertmaxrees> and some other stuff :)
[15:02:29] <robertmaxrees> gotta go.  happy hacking!
[21:43:00] <robertparkerx> I updated jquery and the only problem I have it with a[href*=#]:not([href=#]
[21:43:10] <robertparkerx> it says unrecognized expression
[21:44:01] <robertparkerx> I think I got it
[22:13:19] <robertparkerx> This app had two ver of jquery queue. I removed the old version and was actually able to keep the most updated.
