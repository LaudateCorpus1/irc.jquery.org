[03:36:08] <nytek> Can somebody please, please help me out? I'm trying to make my calculator accept keypress event triggers. Pressing enter should be like clicking equals, and pressing the '1' key should be like clicking the '1' button. I've had no luck thus far, and this is my code if anyone is up to it as they're reading this: http://jsfiddle.net/vcjjsq3r/3/
[03:36:12] <nytek> Please, and thank you.
[03:36:44] <nytek> (The code block in question is at the very bottom of the JavaScript section)
[06:12:44] <Mark__> does anyone know of a way how i can give a unique id to each jquery ui tab, and make it not duplicated when i click on the ‘open new tab’ on my website? if so, help me out.
[06:44:05] <sharpy35> hey guys, i have a problem with a jquery datepicker. i want to disable a set of timespans but from each TimeSpan the from Date is enabled and i dont know why. Maybe someone can solve my prob: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ffd3e0647a6a6453cb51
[06:50:41] <shoky> sharpy35: might need to make sure that the time in the date object is smaller/bigger than from/to times. so set `from`'s time to 23:59:59  , maybe need to set `date`'s and `to`'s time also
[06:51:14] <sharpy35> how do i set that shoky?
[06:51:21] <shoky> sharpy35: or i might have it backwards and you need to set from to 00:00 and date to bigger
[06:51:33] <shoky> sharpy35: .setHour  .setMinutes etc
[06:51:43] <sharpy35> ah cheers. that might be the prob
[06:51:46] <sharpy35> :)
[06:53:20] <shoky> sharpy35: btw unrelated but you should stop using `for` loops, they're messy (with that useless `i` index) and especially in javascript they can lead to annoying bugs
[06:53:54] <sharpy35> can u then help me optimzing the code?
[06:53:57] <sharpy35> shoky?
[06:54:00] <shoky> sharpy35:  disabledDates.forEach(function(disabledDate) { var from = new Date(disabledDate.from); ... }
[06:54:02] <shoky> )
[06:54:20] <shoky> sharpy35: it's not about optimizing really, just making it more readable and less prone to bugs
[06:54:35] <sharpy35> ok awesome :) cheers, i will check it out shoky
[06:54:42] <sharpy35> i will give you feedback
[06:54:52] <shoky> and in this case in fact you can also use .some instead of forEach
[06:54:58] <shoky> so you can break early
[06:55:40] <shoky> and in general you should know about .forEach .map .filter .some, and if you like them also check out .reduce
[06:56:42] <shoky> (just to be clear - they are js methods on arrays. not related to jquery)
[07:10:43] <Mark__> shoky, is there a way i can give specific (or unique) id to the each jquery ui tab, and make it not duplicable when i click on the button to open the same tab?
[07:18:22] <shoky> Mark__ donno what you mean about tabs, but jquery ui has a .uniqueId() method you can run on any element and it'll give it a unique id if it doesnt have an id already
[07:20:32] <Mark__> it has unique ids yes. but do you know if i can make it not duplicable? im thinking the whole tab system as something like a dock bar you can see on a mackintosh that you can open a spefic tab and leave it open, work on other tabs, and go back and forth.
[07:20:45] <Mark__> but i guess that’s a bit hard to materialize..
[07:22:26] <shoky> donno what you mean by duplicable.. don't use the same id again, you wont have duplicates ;p
[07:23:33] <Mark__> hmm,
[07:23:47] <Mark__> cause right now, if i click on the menu button,
[07:23:56] <Mark__> that menu opens up again with a newtab
[07:24:01] <Mark__> but with different id.
[07:24:06] <shoky> no idea what you're talking about.
[07:24:19] <Mark__> okay, exactly what part are you not getting?
[07:24:36] <shoky> i donno what menu button you're talking about.
[07:24:50] <Mark__> i refer you to this website : http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/
[07:24:59] <shoky> lots of custom code
[07:25:01] <Mark__> there are menu buttons on the left side.
[07:25:03] <shoky> not jquery ui :)
[07:25:07] <Mark__> well,
[07:25:15] <Mark__> it’s the custom plugin i guess.
[07:25:37] <shoky> first thing you need to do when asking a question is say what it is you're asking about.. it's not jquery-ui in this case
[07:25:40] <shoky> so say that :)
[07:25:56] <Mark__> hmm. well, okay let me try it again then.
[07:26:06] <shoky> no need to do it again
[07:26:12] <shoky> we're already in the middle
[07:26:21] <Mark__> im having a duplicating problem when using using this particular js tab plugin.
[07:26:24] <Mark__> oky.
[07:26:26] <Mark__> okay lol
[07:26:26] <shoky> but i don't feel like digging through your custom code.
[07:26:37] <Mark__> there isn’t really anything custom.
[07:27:05] <Mark__> i think you are making it complex as you interpret it.
[07:27:16] <shoky> oks go on
[07:27:54] <Mark__> iam only asking you the question, because you dealt with this exact plugin few days ago, remmeber?
[07:27:56] <Mark__> *remember
[07:28:08] <Mark__> the tabadd function
[07:28:15] <Mark__> addtabs rather.
[07:28:20] <shoky> yes and it wasn't fun then either ;P
[07:28:24] <Mark__> haha
[07:28:38] <Mark__> well, now that i fixed the problem.
[07:29:05] <Mark__> the only problem im having is that when i click on the left button,
[07:29:11] <Mark__> it duplicates.simple.
[07:29:15] <Mark__> simple as that.
[07:29:48] <shoky> what duplicates ?
[07:29:59] <Mark__> if you click the same menu twice,
[07:30:06] <Mark__> 2 tabs open.
[07:30:09] <Mark__> with the same exact contnet.
[07:30:11] <shoky> ok?
[07:30:12] <Mark__> *content
[07:30:20] <shoky> then don't let it happen a 2nd time?
[07:30:23] <Mark__> so i was wondering if i can restrict how manytimes i can open the button.
[07:30:32] <Mark__> that’s why im here to ask you.
[07:30:40] <Mark__> how should i go about?
[07:30:48] <shoky> sure you can restrict. in code, you shjould put that logic
[07:31:01] <shoky> you have a click handler
[07:31:08] <Mark__> but the thing is that, i want not just to restrict the 2nd click
[07:31:10] <shoky> you put there what you want to happen when the button is clicked
[07:31:21] <Mark__> but when 2nd click, move to the tab that’s already been opened.
[07:31:25] <Mark__> so that’s a bit tricky part i guess
[07:31:33] <shoky> why
[07:31:39] <Mark__> but if you can’t think of any other way, i shall just ask on SO
[07:31:45] <shoky> uh
[07:31:52] <shoky> you just need to code..
[07:32:01] <Mark__> i feel like we are circling around..
[07:32:05] <shoky> this has nothing to do with unique id's or jquery ui
[07:32:19] <shoky> we're circling around the fact that you don't want to code, or don't know how to code
[07:32:23] <Mark__> it definitely has everything *okay not everything* to do with unique id.
[07:32:33] <Mark__> ah probably the later one.
[07:32:34] <shoky> no, it doesn't
[07:32:37] <shoky> you are telling me
[07:32:43] <shoky> I want X to happen when the button is clicked
[07:32:52] <shoky> to do that
[07:32:52] <Mark__> yes.
[07:32:55] <shoky> you make a click handler
[07:32:57] <shoky> inside it, you put X.
[07:33:06] <Mark__> you are telling me the very basic point.
[07:33:07] <shoky> X might be long
[07:33:12] <shoky> with conditions, and if's
[07:33:15] <Mark__> im expecting something substancial.
[07:33:21] <shoky> and variables that you store for later for the 2nd click
[07:33:25] <shoky> you know... CODING
[07:33:31] <Mark__> nvm i shall ask the others
[07:33:34] <Mark__> but thanks for the help
[07:33:45] <shoky> i'm expecting something subtantial?
[07:33:51] <shoky> jesus you are rude.
[07:33:57] <Mark__> your approach doesn’t quite illuminate neither give me the exact coding.
[07:34:01] <Mark__> im not being rude at all,
[07:34:02] <shoky> no shit
[07:34:12] <shoky> my approach is not to code for you. exactly.
[07:34:14] <Mark__> there is no lesson to be learned here.
[07:34:18] <Mark__> right.
[07:34:27] <shoky> think we should stop here :)
[07:34:36] <Mark__> anyways, thanks for your time.
[07:34:40] <shoky> np
[12:06:07] <juslintek> Anyone knows any good sanitization function?
[12:19:46] <techie28> Hell all
[12:19:52] <techie28> Hello all
[12:20:23] <techie28> an we do some thing like jQuery('#FormID').val(earlySerializedState);.. expecting to populate all form fields as per the serializedState variable?
[12:20:41] <techie28> is it possible?
[12:21:01] <taplar> not sure what your asking.  that would only change the FormID element
[12:21:02] <shoky> that just sets the .value of #FormID element
[12:21:58] <shoky> there's no such built-in method to do what you're asking for, anyways
[12:22:49] <shoky> though i'd bet people have made "unserialize" plugins
[12:23:45] <techie28> assuming FormID is a HTML form.. I want to set all fields in it according to some serialized string
[12:24:07] <techie28> I just want to do that in one line of the code
[12:24:13] <taplar> gonna have to write that yourself, of rind a plugin like shoky said
[12:24:15] <shoky> i just answered it
[12:24:39] <shoky> and indeed google finds many unserialize implementations
[12:24:57] <techie28> thanks Shoky..ill check that
[12:25:08] <taplar> :/ seems like a small thing to write a plugin for
[12:26:16] <shoky> whatcha mean
[12:26:35] <taplar> then again, i guess i'm assuming the keys would be direct mappings to the names
[12:27:15] <techie28> can I do that in one code line if I use some unserialize plugin shoky?
[12:27:35] <shoky> techie28 i think so?
[12:28:06] <techie28> will have to find one like that.
[12:28:11] <techie28> thnks. .:)
[12:30:51] <techie28> here is one I guess ... 2nd answer has written it
[15:23:40] <api_calling> hi guys
[15:24:01] <api_calling> i have a silly question, how do you call another API from within an API ??
[15:48:45] <shoky> i think you need to call it
[16:02:49] <arc_> shoky i guess you answered his question
[16:05:11] <shoky> i like my customers satisfied
[16:05:24] <arc_> :p
[16:25:05] <juslintek> Hi, why is on www.erocharm.com this error: http://snag.gy/fkm8p.jpg
[17:04:55] <lalalaaa> Hi! Trying to play some SoundCloud tracks via HTML5's audio tag, is that possible? http://jsbin.com/siniqaxutu/edit?html,js,output (I tried following http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17769437/play-soundcloud-track-inside-audio-tag-not-working)
[17:06:50] <lalalaaa> It should play https://soundcloud.com/user420885393/halvt-norske
[17:07:08] <lalalaaa> (it's for this reveal.js presentation)
[17:38:45] <amikrop> .after() seems to insert two copies of the element, why could that be?
[18:11:48] <Mark__> is anyone familiar with the jquery tab ui? i want to give each tab a unique id and make them not duplicable when i click on the same menu twice, and also designate the tab to certain id, so that it goes back to the ones already opened when i click on the same menu.
[20:14:42] <sml555> heyy
[20:14:47] <sml555> any admin on???
[20:15:14] <shoky> why?
[20:15:29] <sml555> wanted to talk about a vulnerability I found
[20:15:30] <sml555> :/
[20:15:39] <shoky> in what
[20:15:54] <sml555> the jquery website
[20:15:56] <sml555> :p
[20:16:35] <dedondesta> which cart plugin to use?
[20:17:23] <shoky> sml555: welp this is the jquery support channel. you can talk about it here if you want to discuss, and you can try to find an admin of the website at #jquery-dev or #jquery-infrastructure if you want
[20:18:02] <sml555> shoky: Thanks for that! I'll go and look there
[21:16:05] <z1haze> I know this may sound sill, but if I have a function in an included js file on my page
[21:16:21] <z1haze> and i want to call this function i just do myFunction(); right?
[21:16:51] <shoky> if it's in scope and that is its name, yes ;p
[21:17:15] <z1haze> well im getting its not defined
[21:17:34] <shoky> then it's not, at the point where you're calling it
[21:18:10] <z1haze> well
[21:18:27] <z1haze> inside the include file the function is defined inside of a document ready wrapper
[21:18:49] <z1haze> and on my actual page, AFTER i load the js file, inside another document ready wrapper, i call the function.. how could it not be in scope
[21:18:55] <shoky> then its only inside that scope, unless you put it somewhere else
[21:22:06] <shoky> cant help without seeing it
[21:22:52] <z1haze> my file is something like this: http://dpaste.com/2RCQQ46 i removed anyting that was relavent
[21:23:19] <z1haze> and on my page i just have a $(document).ready(function() { getGraph(2, 'players'); });
[21:23:23] <shoky> if you're already doing require() stuff then why do you want any globals :\
[21:24:07] <z1haze> what? makes my includes easy with browserify
[21:24:18] <shoky> eh
[21:24:26] <z1haze> so i dont have to concat a bunch of files or have a bunch of http requests on my page
[21:24:29] <shoky> you're going against what browserify is for, if you use globals
[21:24:40] <shoky> don't use globals, at all
[21:24:46] <shoky> make your function into a module
[21:24:47] <shoky> and require it
[21:24:54] <z1haze> what is globals,  im not a very experienced js user
[21:25:10] <shoky> globals are variables/functions that you can reach from anywhere, any scope
[21:25:20] <shoky> even outside any function
[21:25:34] <z1haze> alright, well based on what you see here.. why cant i call my function from my page
[21:25:49] <shoky> i donno the exact reason, doesn't matter
[21:25:53] <shoky> you're using browserify wrong
[21:25:55] <shoky> do
[21:26:07] <shoky> module.exports = function getGraph(a,b) { ... }
[21:26:14] <z1haze> ok
[21:26:16] <shoky> put this in a file  e.g.  getGraph.js
[21:26:23] <shoky> then from another file that you need it,
[21:26:41] <shoky> do: var getGraph = require('./getGraph');
[21:26:44] <shoky> no globals
[21:26:54] <z1haze> and then to use it?
[21:27:01] <z1haze> just getGraph(param, param); ?
[21:27:04] <shoky> yes
[21:27:31] <shoky> and don't do this:  window.jQuery = window.$ = require('jquery');
[21:27:36] <shoky> do
[21:27:40] <shoky> var $ = require('jquery');
[21:27:52] <z1haze> i had done that but then it breaks stuff
[21:27:53] <shoky> no globals please.  (putting stuff on `window` makes it global)
[21:28:02] <shoky> then you shoudl fix the stuff it breaks ;p
[21:28:06] <shoky> not break more things :D
[21:28:12] <z1haze> they are libs, not my stuff
[21:28:34] <z1haze> the select2 library breaks with you dont do that
[21:28:45] <z1haze> ill try again though
[21:28:58] <shoky> how are you including select2
[21:29:31] <z1haze> var select2 = require('Select2');
[21:29:34] <z1haze> from npm
[21:30:11] <z1haze> Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined13 @ app.js:16951s @ app.js:1(anonymous function) @ app.js:114../getGraph @ app.js:16966s @ app.js:1e @ app.js:1(anonymous function) @ app.js:1
[21:30:11] <z1haze> 2:137 Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[21:30:52] <z1haze> i fought with this for hours
[21:31:13] <shoky> what lines is it saying the error is coming from
[21:31:21] <shoky> that doesn't look like it's from select2
[21:31:50] <z1haze> here can i pm you a message ill send you a link to the whole file
[21:31:55] <shoky> k
[21:34:26] <z1haze> theres a bunch of stuff in there
[21:34:27] <shoky> you're not doing  var $ = require('jquery')
[21:34:35] <shoky> first of all
[21:34:38] <z1haze> i was when i got the error..
[21:35:04] <z1haze> and secondly after doing all that with the module expor thing.. still setGraph is undefined
[21:35:29] <z1haze> i just do this in my page http://dpaste.com/1CBBXQE
[21:35:54] <shoky> uhm
[21:36:00] <shoky> var velocity = require('./velocity.min.js');  and var tooltipster = require('./jquery.tooltipster.min.js');
[21:36:15] <z1haze> what?
[21:36:15] <shoky> can these even be required like that? are they commonjs modules...
[21:36:27] <z1haze> yea it works
[21:36:38] <z1haze> how would you do it?
[21:37:09] <shoky> nah just thought it's not npm compatible, nevermind
[21:38:51] <z1haze> so why cant i call this method
[21:39:09] <shoky> donno i don't have your full code, and donno how you're building and testing it
[21:39:25] <z1haze> i showed you though
[21:39:25] <shoky> and you didnt' say where those errors are coming from exactly
[21:39:31] <z1haze> if i call the function from inside my app.js
[21:39:34] <z1haze> it works
[21:39:55] <shoky> you didn't show what you did with module.exports
[21:41:27] <z1haze> i did what you told me to do
[21:41:38] <z1haze> put it in a file on its own
[21:41:47] <z1haze> and did var getGraph = require('file');
[21:42:04] <z1haze> and the file was module.exports = function getGraph whatever
[21:42:23] <shoky> then it should work fine. that's how you make a module...
[21:42:48] <z1haze> would it be possible that all of the files arent loaded yet? but i thought thats the the document ready was for
[21:43:25] <shoky> no it has nothing to do with document ready, that just says the DOM is ready. and you only have one js file, no..?
[21:43:39] <z1haze> yea i have a single js file
[21:43:57] <shoky> and it's building with no errors now?
[21:44:06] <shoky> after you did that getGraph require
[21:44:30] <z1haze> i can call it from that file
[21:44:35] <z1haze> but if i try to call it inline on my page
[21:44:36] <z1haze> it wont work
[21:44:41] <z1haze> even if its after i include my js file
[21:44:44] <shoky> what?
[21:44:47] <shoky> inline?
[21:45:12] <z1haze> i only want to call this function on a certain page
[21:45:15] <shoky> if you can call it from the file you're requiring it in, then it's fine
[21:45:18] <z1haze> so i put it in script tags at the end of the body
[21:45:22] <z1haze> im not though
[21:45:28] <shoky> require it from wherever you needit
[21:45:53] <z1haze> browserify wont include files t hat way..
[21:46:01] <shoky> what way..
[21:46:02] <z1haze> they have to be compiled
[21:46:13] <shoky> huh?
[21:46:23] <z1haze> ... i have a app.js file i do my require whatever in
[21:46:28] <z1haze> then i use gulp to compile it all down
[21:46:33] <z1haze> with browserify
[21:46:38] <z1haze> then if shits it to a public file
[21:46:46] <shoky> ok
[21:46:53] <z1haze> i cant just do require('something') in my page
[21:47:01] <shoky> why would you do it in your page?
[21:47:03] <shoky> do it in your app.js
[21:47:08] <shoky> that's where your code is
[21:47:13] <z1haze> rightttt
[21:47:18] <z1haze> but that app.js is included on every page
[21:47:22] <z1haze> i only need to call THIS function on one page
[21:47:31] <z1haze> i feel this must be common
[21:47:40] <z1haze> some pages require certain functions to run, others dont
[21:47:47] <shoky> maybe you're looking for uhh
[21:47:54] <mattshu> won't hurt anything would it
[21:47:59] <shoky> that feature that webpack has built-in, and you can do with browserify with a plugin
[21:48:01] <z1haze> if i put it all in my main file.. it will excete on every page and cause console errors that i dont want
[21:48:01] <shoky> i forgot the name :S
[21:48:07] <shoky> that lets you have multiple bundles
[21:48:27] <shoky> with different dependencies bundled in, so you can have different stuff in different pages
[21:48:33] <shoky> but also a common bundle with mos of your codwe
[21:48:34] <shoky> code
[21:48:38] <z1haze> ill just put it in a a file and include that file on a page
[21:48:40] <z1haze> fk it
[21:48:40] <shoky> most
[21:49:12] <shoky> think it's this https://www.npmjs.com/package/multi-bundle
[22:56:16] <b4b> now a days everyone wanna code like they got somethin to say but nothing comes out when they move the keys just a bunch of jubberish
[23:08:59] <Mark__> anyone good at jquery take a look at mypage and see what the problem is?
[23:14:09] <kevireilly> b4b: and motherfathers act like they forgot about dreQuery
[23:46:29] <graphettion> Can someone explain to me why the userTries variable is not incrementing? - https://jsfiddle.net/kvv02302/
[23:48:31] <mattshu> does the alert appear?
[23:48:51] <graphettion> Ah, it has to be outside the function.
[23:48:53] <graphettion> lol
[23:49:17] <graphettion> I put var userTries = 0, userLimit = 2; outside and it worked.
[23:49:29] <mattshu> I just realized it was fiddle *rubs eyes*
[23:49:45] <graphettion> haha, np, it's late. There's an excuse!
[23:49:53] <graphettion> Thanks for looking mattshu! :)
[23:50:14] <graphettion> Now I just need to figure out how to check the correct answer.
[23:50:26] <graphettion> After two wrong tries.
[23:51:07] <django_> hey all
[23:51:15] <django_> what is the best way to create html on jquery and send it to the html?
[23:52:16] <graphettion> http://api.jquery.com/html/ ?
[23:53:10] <Renari> I prefer http://api.jquery.com/append/
[23:55:38] <arc_> you can do something like $('<div>').addClass('class').text('text').appendTo('#test');
[23:55:44] <arc_> or $('#test').append('<div class="class">text</div>');
[23:55:46] <mattshu> isn't that resetting userTries to 0 each time you submit?
[23:55:52] <graphettion> Yeah, appends is prolly what you're looking for.
[23:56:04] <graphettion> .html() removes all the text and replaces it what what you put in it.
[23:56:12] <graphettion> .append just adds it to the end.
[23:56:13] <mattshu> i'm not familiar with how variable initialization works in jquery yet but you may be setting it back to 0 each time that function is called
[23:56:50] <graphettion> mattshu: I solved it.
[23:57:13] <graphettion> But, yes, you're right. I had to move it outside the function to get it to work.
