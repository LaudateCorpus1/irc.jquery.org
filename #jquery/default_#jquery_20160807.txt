[00:02:30] <Captain_Ramius> acidjazz, it's a boolean that tells if the browser is online or not
[00:03:00] <Captain_Ramius> Evidently, it's exactly what we need, along with HTML5 localStorage, to make an offline webapp and avoid building a native app

[00:09:58] <b1tchcakes> anyone know how in jquery to search all decendents of an li/ol element to find any form element but ignore searching from deeper li/ol containers which may or may not be inside the current element we are searching from?
[00:15:58] <b1tchcakes> actually i'm trying to figure out how to do this: $(this).find_all('input, select, textarea’).except_items_that_are_nested_deeper_inside_of('ol,li’)
[00:17:47] <arc_> .children()
[00:18:27] <arc_> The .children() method differs from .find() in that .children() only travels a single level down the DOM tree while .find() can traverse down multiple levels to select descendant elements (grandchildren, etc.) as well.
[00:19:54] <b1tchcakes> I have a nested tree.  and inside each li of the nested tree, there are form elements, tables, and form elements inside of tables (etc).  so i'm trying to basically grab all the form elements that are inside of an <li> without getting ones that are in deeper <li> elements
[00:20:51] <alturic> Hey guys, I'm officially at my wits end plugging away at this. I'm ajax'ing something and I'm looking to continuously run the ajax IF an input checkbox has a specific class. I can get it to work with .click (fires once only), or .change (fires once only again obviously) but... :-(
[00:20:58] <arc_> pretty sure you're going to need a custom function to do that
[00:21:16] <b1tchcakes> <li><x><input></x><input><y><z><input></z></y><li><input></li> << so in this case it would get all li items except that last one
[00:21:33] <b1tchcakes> i mean all input items
[00:21:47] <arc_> read up on .filter()
[00:21:48] <alturic> I'm almost looking for (newbie here, so try not to tear into me) a way for an if block to "only use this when input.elementname has the class of 'active' on it"
[00:22:55] <arc_> what is elementname
[00:23:08] <alturic> current_obs
[00:23:19] <arc_> so that's a class
[00:23:42] <alturic> I'm basically trying to have google maps constantly retrieve something from my own json, but I only want it to do it when a checkmark is checked.
[00:23:46] <arc_> .hasClass() returns true if the element has a class and false if it doesn't
[00:24:19] <alturic> I can get everything working, but not a "keep retrieving json while checkmark is checked" type of thing. again terribly sorry for the layman wording.
[00:25:04] <arc_> .checked returns true if the object is checked and false if it is not
[00:25:18] <alturic> arc_: Right, but if ($('.current_obs').hasClass("active")) {  doesn't seem to actually be running what's inside (simple console.log saying "active is on")
[00:25:23] <arc_> but that is a javascript method so you would have to use this.checked or $('selector')[0].checked
[00:25:50] <alturic> Perhaps explained in true jquery terms, I can get those to both work realistically if I put it inside a .click or .change, but again that would only execute all the code inside once.
[00:26:18] <arc_> you can use setinterval to repeat behavior
[00:26:48] <arc_> i don't know what people here would say is the 'accepted' way to repeat behavior automatically at an interval
[00:27:10] <arc_> but that's what i would do anyway
[00:29:17] <alturic> arc_: That won't work either though. http://pastebin.com/raw/K1CcUh7y is my code. google.maps is constantly updating data, which is verified by the console.log, but I only want that code inside the .hasClass area to keep firing WHILE a checkmark is clicked, or a class is active. Does that make sense? :-/
[00:31:12] <arc_> https://jsfiddle.net/6050mxb3/
[00:31:17] <arc_> .hasClass() seems to work as expected
[00:31:36] <arc_> i even forgot a semicolon :p
[00:33:14] <alturic> https://jsfiddle.net/6050mxb3/3/
[00:35:04] <alturic> So while you're going to most likely say "of course THAT won't work", that's my problem. It's adding the class, but it's (apparently?) only checking IF #test hasClass "active" once per pageload?
[00:35:46] <arc_> yes, so you need you combine that with setinterval
[00:35:52] <arc_> it's only going to run this code once
[00:35:58] <arc_> there has to be something happening to make the code run again
[00:36:05] <arc_> that can be an event or setinterval
[00:36:31] <alturic> So in relation to my pastebin and google maps, I need something to re-check if the checkmark is active when a variable is updated...
[00:37:01] <alturic> Actually, that's really exactly what I need, since one of those 4 google maps lat/lon variables are updated everytime the google map viewport is changed.
[00:37:08] <alturic> back to google it is
[00:37:27] <arc_> i guess google maps api might have an event that fires when the viewport is changed
[00:37:36] <arc_> you could just use on mouseup or something
[00:37:52] <arc_> although if the data hasn't loaded yet that's not really what you want
[00:38:19] <arc_> it might have an event that fires when data has loaded
[01:01:29] <b1tchcakes> If I do something like div.html(code) and code contains nested elements, how can i get jquery to refresh the dom so that it knows they are there?
[06:27:47] <ahoo> how can i make jquery not occupy $ and jQuery?
[06:29:33] <ahoo> got it
[08:21:50] <bruck> so i'm using dropwizard (java backend) with mustache to form the html, should i use jquery along with this to have more control over the frontend? should i switch to handlebars instead of mustache?
[08:23:05] <bruck> i guess all i really want to do at this stage is send json to the server
[09:00:53] <ozcanesen> Hello for example I initialize a widget $.sweetButtons(), then i load content using $('#foo').html('<div class="sweetbuttons widget foo bar">'); so this widget is not initialized. I know i should initialize it again, but is there any other way to do that easily ?
[10:36:51] <z1haze> hey, is it possible to load in new scripts with ajax
[10:37:22] <z1haze> like if i return a view from my backend that comes with some script includes at the bottom, will those scripts work, and have the binded events, etc
[11:05:57] <z1haze> I need to know how to get the element that was clicked from a pjax:start event
[11:07:14] <z1haze> and it looks like all ive got at this point was an xhr
[11:12:03] <z1haze> anyone know how to get the element that was clicked from a pjax event
[11:50:56] <alturic> Hey guys, I'm defining 2 globals, lat and lng, and if the first console.log returns defined values, the one outside of the function doesn't... I'm kinda confused as to "why" exactly... http://pastebin.com/raw/6dwXyqEk
[11:56:58] <shoky> alturic: because the last line runs _before_ the code inside the callback function.  because the callback is run asynchronously (later on)
[11:57:35] <shoky> if you want things to happen after then you need to put them in the callbacks
[11:58:18] <alturic> hmm
[16:11:31] <emr> Hello, how i can detect click events in iframe which is dynamically created, is it possible?
[17:53:38] <neilpdx> hello all
[18:02:06] <mxa> hello?
[18:02:19] <neilpdx> that's it just hello
[18:02:27] <neilpdx> nothing else to report at the moment
[18:02:28] <mxa> no
[18:02:48] <mxa> i just wanted to join
[18:03:08] <neilpdx> ok welcome and nice to meet you mxa
[18:03:17] <mxa> thanks
[18:05:45] <mxa> is there a way to create your own events?
[18:16:03] <neilpdx> hi mxa, not that i am aware of.
[18:17:16] <neilpdx> there are so many new things in html5 that i could be wrong.  but html5 would not be a jquery topic
[18:18:33] <neilpdx> you could probably create your own events if you were developing a desktop application (like a fat client) with visual c++
[18:23:20] <neilpdx> right now i am trying to figure out how to use AJAX with html5 desktop notifications
[22:27:43] <jaggz> how would I access all "foo-*" elements (to add them with window.customElements.define('foo-something', class extends HTMLElement {...}); ) ?
[23:26:28] <Idealien> Can anyone offer a suggestion why in http://pastebin.com/VRbniUAQ the commented out ajax data function would not work whereas the uncommented one which builds same "result" directly as a string would? By work, I mean that the function version does not get added to the get request string.
