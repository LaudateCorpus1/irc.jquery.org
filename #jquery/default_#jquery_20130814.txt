[00:18:32] <MrS1lentcz> hello, i have troubles with checkbox. i need handling one choose aplied on checkboxs list. this is my test case http://jsfiddle.net/XeTmq/3/ which not works corecctly...
[00:20:24] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: s/attr/prop/
[00:20:37] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: attr is for attributes, not properties
[00:22:22] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: oh, good observation, thx :)
[00:28:39] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: it is too sad google shows top hits as web sites with "attr" suggestion instead of prop...
[00:28:54] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: prop works, thank you very much..
[00:29:07] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: well attr was split up in jquery 1.5
[00:29:16] <Cork> before that attr tried to do both
[00:29:27] <MrS1lentcz> i see, ok
[00:29:30] <Cork> and that is why so many sites give the wrong info
[00:29:53] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: also use api.jquery.com
[00:30:02] <LekeFly> MrS1lentcz: I would clean up that code tho :P
[00:30:09] <Cork> then you will always find the up to date info
[00:30:14] <LekeFly> And maybe use labels?
[00:31:22] <daveAway> 'lo, to access an object array, you use myobarray[0].thingy right?
[00:31:30] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: okey...
[00:31:49] <Cork> daveAway: by object array you mean an array of objects right?
[00:31:55] <daveAway> yeah
[00:31:58] <Cork> then yes
[00:32:02] <MrS1lentcz> LekeFly: what? there is generated html code...
[00:32:26] <daveAway> cos for some reason it's not working, but it works in another file and it's written exactly the same
[00:32:35] <daveAway> says index is undefined, but when i console.log it, i can see it is defined
[00:32:47] <LekeFly> MrS1lentcz: Just isnt clean.. and using labels you can click the text.
[00:32:51] <Cork> daveAway: where does this come from?
[00:32:54] <Cork> ajax?
[00:32:58] <daveAway> from a parsed ajax
[00:33:00] <amirite> how do i add elements to a stack without creating a new object
[00:33:03] <amirite> something essentially like this = this.add( 'selector' );
[00:33:10] <Cork> daveAway: is the server sending the correct content-type?
[00:33:15] <daveAway> yeah, but also, i used a dummy array of objects
[00:33:18] <Cork> (application/json)
[00:33:28] <Cork> daveAway: code please
[00:33:29] <daveAway> hrm.. ill have a look
[00:35:17] <MrS1lentcz> LekeFly: it is under construction, application logic has higher priority than cleaning html code. maybe i will use click events on there text for more performance - i am loading this content with ajax ;)
[00:37:49] <daveAway> http://pastebin.com/CH6jsarm
[00:38:49] <Cork> daveAway: 1. instead of parseJSON, config your server to send correct content-type header
[00:39:02] <Cork> 2. inspect what storeobj becomes
[00:39:06] <Cork> (console.log)
[00:39:18] <daveAway> how do i do taht? im doing it locally
[00:39:45] <Cork> header('Content-Type: application/json');
[00:39:48] <Cork> (in php)
[00:39:54] <daveAway> ah
[00:40:09] <Cork> if you do that, the server will actually tell the truth
[00:40:15] <Cork> and you won't need line 10
[00:40:22] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/gBUXz/ < hey guys, how do i add here that if its no valid, alert something
[00:41:00] <Cork> Tomashe: instead of returning it do an if check
[00:41:05] <Cork> and then run your alert from there
[00:41:52] <Cork> daveAway: btw also imagearray is an object, not an array
[00:42:03] <Tomashe> hmm ok let me try
[00:42:26] <daveAway> when i log it it gives me 0 1 2 3 4 each one containing multiple stuff thougH?
[00:42:29] <fuse_> hi everybody
[00:43:43] <Cork> daveAway: http://pastebin.com/2z22fCiv
[00:44:37] <Cork> daveAway: also if your sending an array from the server, you won't need that loop
[00:44:44] <Cork> *you're
[00:46:56] <daveAway> it sends an array of an array
[00:47:24] <daveAway> so like {this="hello", that="hello"}{this="bye", that ="bye"}
[00:47:40] <Cork> daveAway: objects in javascript is arrays in php
[00:47:51] <Cork> so that would be an array of objects in js
[00:48:02] <daveAway> yeah, so that's what i have
[00:48:10] <Cork> then you don't need the loop
[00:48:14] <daveAway> the print out at the bottom of that pastebin is a single console.log
[00:48:18] <Cork> result will be what you want
[00:48:23] <daveAway> it's not looped
[00:48:28] <Cork> .each is a loop
[00:48:32] <daveAway> hrm, result is giving ..  one second
[00:48:37] <daveAway> yeah it is a loop
[00:49:32] <daveAway> yeah i get lots of objects
[00:49:44] <fuse_> could someone tell me how do we know where the item is drop (for a draggable element), when the stop event is triggered?
[00:50:50] <fgh> you could do a .offset() on the element when the stop event is triggered
[00:50:52] <daveAway> but i need those objects indexed cork
[00:50:56] <daveAway> whcih is what the loop was for
[00:51:05] <Cork> daveAway: they should already be indexed
[00:51:37] <Cork> daveAway: the json should be [{this:"hello", that:"hello"}, {this:"bye", that:"bye"}]
[00:51:47] <Cork> and that would give you index 0 and 1
[00:51:48] <fuse_> fgh and after?
[00:52:19] <daveAway> array[0].that is undefined
[00:52:36] <daveAway> but i can see that it's not, that's what irritating me
[00:52:43] <Cork> daveAway: do you have a link or an example snippet of the json you get?
[00:53:01] <fgh> fuse_, check out http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[00:53:20] <fuse_> yes a learning now
[00:53:48] <daveAway> http://pastebin.com/zzwR7uNB
[00:54:45] <Cork> daveAway: and result[0].ID is undefined?
[00:54:53] <Cork> what about result.length?
[00:55:36] <fuse_> oh ok, i would know the dom element
[00:55:36] <daveAway> result.length gives me 5
[00:55:42] <fuse_> not the position
[00:55:47] <Cork> ok and result[0].ID ?
[00:55:57] <Cork> should be 35
[00:56:18] <daveAway> yeah that works
[00:56:32] <daveAway> hrm, maybe it's that variable i'm using to take it out of that ajax returned function
[00:56:33] <Cork> ok then do console.log(Object.keys(result[0])
[00:56:47] <Cork> and check what keys you have in the object
[00:56:58] <Cork> * console.log(Object.keys(result[0]))
[00:57:20] <daveAway> "ID", "Genus", "Species", "Location", "Date", "LocationB", "LocationC", "LocationD", "Text", "tempfile"
[00:57:31] <daveAway> i need a global variable to take it out of that function
[00:57:35] <Cork> daveAway: so you want Location not location
[00:57:43] <daveAway> i was using imagearray={};
[00:57:54] <Cork> daveAway: imagearray = result
[00:57:54] <daveAway> yeah i use Location
[00:58:04] <daveAway> yup, that's what i did *crosses fingers
[00:58:07] <daveAway> ill try again
[00:58:33] <Cork> daveAway: also remember you have to make sure the ajax call have ran before you try to access the global variable
[00:58:37] <Cork> else it will be undefined
[00:58:50] <daveAway> ahhhh
[00:59:00] <daveAway> that could be what it is?
[00:59:07] <Cork> i suspect that ya
[00:59:09] <daveAway> ah no, nevermind cos console.log was workin before
[00:59:10] <daveAway> k one second
[00:59:40] <daveAway> i defined imagearray like var imagearray ={};
[00:59:46] <Cork> no need
[00:59:48] <daveAway> then imagearray = result;
[00:59:50] <Cork> just do var imagearray;
[01:00:10] <daveAway> yeah undefined
[01:00:17] <daveAway> there's a Load function isnt there
[01:00:34] <Cork> so your running the code before ajax has finished
[01:00:37] <daveAway> so its not have enough time
[01:00:40] <daveAway> having*
[01:00:44] <daveAway> yup, okay that's something i can work with
[01:00:51] <Cork> you most likely need to wait for the success callback
[01:00:59] <Cork> daveAway: what is it you're trying to do?
[01:01:10] <daveAway> just return some images and stuff from a picture of the day
[01:01:34] <Cork> daveAway: you basically never can return values from an ajax call
[01:01:34] <daveAway> i wont be returning tempfile/ID etc
[01:01:43] <Cork> you always have to have a function to call with the new value
[01:01:56] <daveAway> how do you mean?
[01:02:11] <daveAway> so wait for success, then call the function for the rest of the stuff
[01:02:17] <Cork> function() { $.ajax(); return [new values];  }
[01:02:45] <Cork> daveAway: yes
[01:02:49] <doug65536> how do I do a UTF-8 ajax request?
[01:02:58] <daveAway> it's in a $(document).ready(..
[01:03:05] <Cork> doug65536: by the server setting utf8 encoding header
[01:03:16] <doug65536> Cork: of course. thanks!
[01:03:16] <Cork> daveAway: doesn't really matter
[01:03:22] <spobat> I got a switch-clause where some, but not all case-statements share variables with equal variable names. This leads to name conflicts. So does it make sense to wrap the whole case statement in a function just for the purpose of scope? http://ideone.com/dvjm9k
[01:03:51] <daveAway> im not sure what you mean? how do i get it to load at the beginning then?
[01:04:15] <introspectr3> oy, can someone please exlain the following? https://dpaste.de/hsb13/ I don't understand how the rows are being inserted after the </table>
[01:04:39] <Cork> spobat: why do you not just reuse the variables and define them before the case?
[01:04:59] <spobat> Cork: because only some (about 4 of 10) case statements actually use them
[01:05:29] <Cork> introspectr3: ajax is async, so you call line: 1. 2, 10, 3-7
[01:05:48] <Cork> spobat: shouldn't matter normally
[01:05:55] <spobat> Cork: they don't make sense for the others, because args[0 / 1 / 2 / ...] are interpreted different there :/
[01:06:05] <introspectr3> Cork, is there a relatively painless workaround?
[01:06:23] <Cork> introspectr3: move the line 10 to line 8
[01:06:49] <daveAway> k thanks Cork, i think i can sort it out from here
[01:07:26] <Cork> spobat: if you define a variable in a switch statement it will be defined globally for that function anyway
[01:07:44] <Cork> spobat: and just defining the variable name, doesn't cost you anyway so...
[01:08:03] <Cork> (while creating scopes do have a small cost)
[01:08:09] <spobat> okay
[01:08:18] <introspectr3> thank you Cork :)
[01:08:25] <Cork> np
[01:12:49] <Tomashe> anyone have an ipad on him?
[01:16:50] <massivehiggsfiel> is there a way with jquery mobile to have an element at the vertical center of the page and if you scroll down, it will move upwards until it reaches the top of the viewport and then sticks there?
[01:17:34] <massivehiggsfiel> like a header with fixed position but the element doesnt start at the top and will scroll with the page until it reaches the top
[01:18:06] <Cork> massivehiggsfiel: what you want is sticky headers, not sure if jqm has support for it internally though
[01:18:13] <Cork> you might need a plugin for it
[01:18:34] <massivehiggsfiel> yeah i know of sticky headers, but if i define one, it will always display it at the top of the viewport
[01:18:58] <massivehiggsfiel> i want it to start at the center, scroll with the page until it reaches the top and then stick there
[01:19:08] <massivehiggsfiel> im not even sure what to google ;)
[01:19:08] <Cork> massivehiggsfiel: that doesn't sounds like a sticky header; just a header
[01:19:25] <Cork> the sticky part is that is sticks when it is about to be scrolled off the top
[01:20:03] <massivehiggsfiel> yeah exactly but the element shouldn't start at the top, which unfortunately every jqm header element does
[01:20:28] <Cork> massivehiggsfiel: ya, so you need to look for code to make a sticky header
[01:21:18] <massivehiggsfiel> i know how to make a sticky header, i dont know how to make a sticky header which will start at the center of the page
[01:21:29] <Cork> ...
[01:21:31] <massivehiggsfiel> ;)
[01:21:33] <spobat> should $(this) be cached?
[01:21:43] <spobat> into e.g. $this or so?
[01:22:39] <spobat> i think yep :P
[01:22:55] <Cork> massivehiggsfiel: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+sticky+header
[01:23:16] <Cork> massivehiggsfiel: if it doesn't do what you describe, it isn't a sticky header
[01:23:32] <Cork> *then it isn't
[01:24:11] <massivehiggsfiel> then it doesnt seem to be a sticky header
[01:24:17] <massivehiggsfiel> sticky headers are always on the viewport top
[01:24:27] <Cork> no
[01:24:32] <massivehiggsfiel> no?
[01:24:35] <Cork> that's just floating headers
[01:25:10] <Cork> (if jqm choose to abuse the term it's there problem)
[01:25:23] <massivehiggsfiel> ah okay
[01:33:40] <DarsVaeda> with element.html() I get the contents, how do I get the element too?
[01:34:18] <Cork> DarkGhost`: $('<div').html(element.clone()).html()
[01:34:20] <Cork> opps
[01:34:25] <Cork> * $('<div>').html(element.clone()).html()
[01:34:36] <DarsVaeda> okay thanks
[01:34:43] <nesoi> I'm trying to do a taphold event on an element I already have a tap event on. It triggers both even though I do a stoppropagation, stopimmediatepropagation and preventdefault. What can I do to make it work?
[01:35:45] <Cork> nesoi: the tap will trigger before the taphold event
[01:36:03] <nesoi> cork... so what can I do about that?
[01:36:08] <Cork> so is it already to late to prevent the earlier one
[01:36:26] <nesoi> I'm doing an android app and they use taphold for differnt things than tap.
[01:36:41] <Cork> nesoi: you would have to find a pattern in tap to identify it is about to be a taphold event
[01:37:21] <DarsVaeda> hmm not working too well
[01:37:22] <Cork> so basically you have to predict what the user is about to do
[01:37:27] <nesoi> cork I can't have it ignore tap unless the finger comes up?
[01:37:40] <DarsVaeda> what I actually need to do is wrap an image in an anchor
[01:37:55] <zyzyzy> hi, i have a string "lorem ipsum [foobar],dolor sit amet [foobar]". i used regexp to check for words inside a square bracket and i did it. im just wondering if there are alternatives to using regexp?
[01:38:06] <Cork> nesoi: that would be dragend if i remember correctly
[01:38:41] <Cork> DarkGhost`: why not just do $('img').wrap('span') ?
[01:39:45] <Cork> DarkGhost`: or var parent = $('<span>'); element.before(parent); parent.append(element);
[01:40:06] <Cork> no need for you to serialize the dom to html before you do it
[01:41:56] <DarsVaeda> wrap works just fine :) thanks
[01:52:17] <krz> i have a string "lorem [foo] ipsum [bar],dolor sit amet [foo]". i need a way to detect the number of occurrences for [foo] and [bar]. where should i start?
[01:53:35] <Cork> .match(/\[(foo|bar)\]/g).length - 1
[01:54:04] <Cork> hmm wait no the - 1 isn't needed
[01:55:53] <zeropx> How would I go about doing a scrollTo on an innerContainer IF the body,html has overflow hidden on it? http://jsfiddle.net/Z28pu/
[01:57:13] <Cork> zeropx: not sure what the problem is; works just fine here...
[01:57:24] <zeropx> try and click another.
[01:57:27] <doug65536> zeropx: works
[01:57:52] <zeropx> Cork, doug65536  or click in same. It WILL scroll, but its not scrolling correctly.
[01:58:03] <doug65536> ah I see http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/Z28pu/1/
[01:58:14] <zeropx> the intent is if I click on the next thing, it should scroll to top
[02:01:40] <nesoi> cork: the docs claim that tap is triggered on the release, so taphold should be triggered first if the user doesn't release: http://api.jquerymobile.com/tap/
[02:01:45] <nesoi> hi doug65536
[02:02:08] <doug65536> nesoi: hi
[02:02:31] <nesoi> maybe you know about this: I'm trying to do something on a taphold event on an element and I already have a tap event defined on that element
[02:02:36] <Cork> zeropx: http://jsfiddle.net/Z28pu/6/
[02:02:42] <nesoi> the taphold works, but the tap is also triggered. How can I avoid that?
[02:02:57] <Cork> zeropx: actually http://jsfiddle.net/Z28pu/8/
[02:03:22] <zeropx> Cork: brilliant. I see what you did. I just learned about using prop as well.
[02:03:46] <zeropx> Cork: thanks very much.
[02:03:52] <Cork> np
[02:04:56] <Cork> nesoi: ah, it's there fake event thingy
[02:05:38] <Cork> nesoi: well then you could do something like storing a value if you want the tap event to not do anything
[02:05:50] <Cork> nesoi: they are different events so you can't stop them from event
[02:06:37] <nesoi> tap is triggered AFTER taphold (on the release) so within the taphold function I should be able to do something to the tap no?
[02:08:22] <Cork> nesoi: like i just said, yes, but you can't cancel one event type from another
[02:08:43] <Cork> nesoi: you need to store a value and then check for it in the later event
[02:09:34] <Cork> nesoi: one of the reasons you get a bit of a confusing here is that tap and taphold doens't really exist
[02:09:40] <Cork> it is jqm faked events
[02:09:53] <Cork> it's based around dragstart, dragend and click
[02:10:02] <nesoi> I got it to work... I set a global indicating I was in a taphold
[02:10:05] <nesoi> thanks
[02:10:06] <Cork> uh sorry touchstart, touchend
[02:10:14] <Cork> not drag -_-'
[02:12:20] <starfox21> what is a good JS library for form validation (I am using rails) ?
[02:12:49] <Cork> starfox21: i think there are some jqlibs for integrating with the active models
[02:13:05] <Cork> starfox21: alternatively there is the commonly used jquery.validator
[02:24:53] <quipper> How do I redirect users after they've come back from login in on facebook?
[03:09:22] <xqo> when doing myElements.each(), how can I return the content of the first <h2> inside each element?
[03:10:21] <_Jens> xqo: $(this).children('h2').first().text();
[03:11:12] <motaka2> hello does serialize array gather infos about check boxes? I think the question is yes but for me when I check the check boxes one's value 0 and the other is ''

[03:18:21] * Successful is now away, auto-away after 20 minutes (log\on pager\on)
[03:18:44] <xqo> how should line 4 really be? http://hastebin.com/ruroqonoxu.js
[03:19:20] <xqo> i want to select all .product inside the .productlist its looping over with each
[03:20:04] <doug65536> xqo: $(this).find('.product')
[03:20:35] <xqo> thank you
[03:20:48] <doug65536> xqo: actually, the whole thing can be reduced to $('.productlist .product')
[03:20:57] <xqo> but that will select ALL .products
[03:21:02] <xqo> not just the one its looping over, right?
[03:21:12] <doug65536> xqo: no, it will select .product that are a child of .productlist
[03:21:24] <xqo> but theres more than one .productlist
[03:21:37] <xqo> i only want to do things with one of them
[03:21:43] <doug65536> so? your code will do the each on all of them
[03:21:46] <doug65536> which one of them?
[03:22:15] <doug65536> $('.productlist') will give you a collection of every element with that class
[03:22:25] <doug65536> if you .each on that, the each will run for all of them
[03:22:34] <doug65536> so which .productlist do you actually want?
[03:22:40] <xqo> right...
[03:23:22] <doug65536> xqo: if you expand what you're showing, there might be a nice way to do it. you are omitting too much for me to suggest a way to do it
[03:23:42] <xqo> okej, sec
[03:25:39] <xqo> doug65536 i want to sort the .products here alphabetically, but only the ones inside its parent .productlist http://hastebin.com/hamiquwilo.xml
[03:26:32] <doug65536> only the ones in the same div as the button?
[03:26:39] <xqo> yeah
[03:27:06] <doug65536> ok, then you can use $(this).closest('div') to find the closest parent div from the button click handler
[03:27:20] <doug65536> then use .find('.product') to only find .product under that div
[03:27:35] <doug65536> I'll show you in jsfiddle
[03:27:42] <xqo> onclick="sort($(this).closest('div'));"
[03:27:43] <xqo> ?
[03:28:02] <doug65536> xqo: yes
[03:28:14] <doug65536> wait, no
[03:28:27] <doug65536> onclick="sort($(this).closest('div').find('.product'));"
[03:29:04] <doug65536> that will pass a collection of .product 's that are under that closest div
[03:29:30] <doug65536> "closest" means, look through the parents until you find a matching element
[03:29:50] <doug65536> then the find means, look under this thing for .product
[03:29:56] <doug65536> that thing*
[03:30:23] <xqo> okay, that worked
[03:30:29] <xqo> how about the actual sorting? hehe
[03:30:39] <xqo> id actually not like to sort by the ids, sec.
[03:30:55] <doug65536> you can do that too
[03:30:58] <doug65536> using remove
[03:31:12] <doug65536> one sec, I'll make fiddle...
[03:32:10] <xqo> doug65536 id like to sort them by the content of that <h2> http://hastebin.com/cocigusefu.xml
[03:33:08] <doug65536> I don't see h2
[03:33:20] <doug65536> by text content of div?
[03:33:23] <xqo> inside .product div
[03:33:49] <doug65536> sort by "Im product One"... etc?
[03:33:57] <xqo> sort by line 13
[03:34:06] <xqo> 13, 16, 20
[03:34:14] <xqo> 13,16,21*
[03:34:18] <xqo> the content of those <h2>
[03:34:36] <doug65536> ok
[03:40:38] <doug65536> xqo: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/9jRbR/
[03:40:57] <doug65536> removed debugger statement
[03:41:05] <doug65536> refresh
[03:41:16] <xqo> what is .target?
[03:41:36] <doug65536> notice that ev is a parameter to that callback function
[03:41:43] <doug65536> ev.target tells me which button it was
[03:42:06] <doug65536> you could use $(this) as well
[03:42:07] <xqo> aah
[03:42:24] <doug65536> I prefer target because that works if you are using event bubbling too
[03:42:28] <xqo> doug65536 thank you very much!!!
[03:42:32] <doug65536> xqo: np
[03:43:16] <xqo> doug65536 what does that empty .remove() do?
[03:43:27] <doug65536> line 6?
[03:43:32] <xqo> yes
[03:43:42] <doug65536> it removes the elements from the page
[03:43:57] <xqo> oh right, coz ur returning sorted ones
[03:43:58] <doug65536> .remove returns the removed elements
[03:43:58] <xqo> okej thank you
[03:44:08] <Tomashe> $.each(data,function(){ < why this isnt working
[03:44:13] <Tomashe> data is an array
[03:45:09] <Tomashe> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[03:45:13] <doug65536> Tomashe: it does work... something else is wrong
[03:45:36] <Tomashe> when i remove that each .. all working
[03:45:46] <doug65536> Tomashe: can you make a fiddle?
[03:46:52] <Tomashe> hmm
[03:46:54] <Tomashe> yes
[03:46:55] <Tomashe> wait
[03:47:44] <Tomashe> u were correct
[03:47:47] <Tomashe> i was my bad
[03:48:17] <doug65536_> Tomashe: I had power outage
[03:50:23] <Tomashe> :) hehe
[03:50:26] <doug65536_> each works http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/6Bvyb/2/
[03:50:38] <doug65536_> I'd have to see your code to know what is wrong
[03:50:46] <reloadz> hi! can u answer me why 11.11(input value) X 23(input value)  = 255.52999999999997
[03:50:54] <reloadz> it should be 255.53
[03:50:55] <Tomashe> my object is $(this) inside of it i have object [0] how do i reach it
[03:51:21] <doug65536_> Tomashe: not sure what you are saying
[03:51:42] <Tomashe> data is an array with objects
[03:51:56] <Tomashe> when i do .each on that "data" i get objects .. how do i get inside them
[03:52:10] <Tomashe> usualy i was doing data[i] or data.object ..
[03:52:44] <reloadz> did anyone got my problem?
[03:53:10] <doug65536_> reloadz: you wanted 255.53 ?
[03:53:18] <reloadz> yes
[03:53:49] <doug65536_> (255.5399999).toFixed(2)
[03:53:49] <doug65536_> "255.54"
[03:53:54] <reloadz> why it returns wrong result?
[03:54:28] <doug65536_> reloadz: because it is floating point math. it isn't wrong, it is off by an extremely tiny amount
[03:55:36] <doug65536_> it is off by 3/1,000,000,000,000
[03:55:42] <reloadz> 11.11 X 23 sould be 255.53, not 255.52999999999997
[03:55:48] <doug65536_> 3 trillionths
[03:56:12] <doug65536_> sorry, billionths
[03:56:25] <doug65536_> no it's trillionths
[03:56:41] <doug65536_> 3 trillionths is pretty close
[03:57:01] <doug65536_> reloadz: look up floating point roundoff in google
[03:57:42] <reloadz> k! thx! :)
[03:58:14] <doug65536_> Tomashe: does this help? http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/6Bvyb/5/
[03:58:26] <doug65536_> is $(this) an array?
[03:59:24] <doug65536_> Tomashe: you are being vague. $(this) is the item in data
[03:59:35] <doug65536_> do wherever you would have said 'data' you say $(this)
[03:59:52] <doug65536_> oops
[04:00:06] <doug65536_> I mean, wherever you would have said 'data[<some index>]' you say $(this)
[04:00:36] <doug65536_> so if code before was data[i].something, it becomes $(this).something
[04:05:20] <doug65536_> Tomashe: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/6Bvyb/
[04:05:57] <doug65536_> sorry, above I should have said, this.something, not $(this)
[04:06:06] <Tomashe> Uncaught SyntaxError: Illegal break statement
[04:06:08] <doug65536_> I'm accustomed to wrapping raw elements
[04:06:21] <Tomashe> yes i fixed that aswel thanks doug65536
[04:06:26] <Tomashe> you are the best
[04:06:38] <Tomashe> but now i try to BREAK .each loop and i get that " Uncaught SyntaxError: Illegal break statement "
[04:06:50] <doug65536_> you can't break $.each
[04:07:01] <doug65536_> that way anyway
[04:07:22] <doug65536_> return false if you want to break
[04:07:39] <Tomashe> hmm
[04:09:47] <doug65536_> in a $.each callback, "return false;" means "break;", and "return true;" means continue; not returning anything also continues when it falls off the end of the callback function
[04:09:55] <doug65536_> any non false return continues actually
[04:10:56] <_pash> hello, can someone explain to me how caching from ajax get requests can be used, so when a page is changed with http is doesnt reload the request. and how do i clean the cache or update it?
[04:11:28] <doug65536_> _pash: $.ajax takes a setting, cache: true or cache: false
[04:11:55] <doug65536_> _pash: $.ajaxSetup can do the same thing for all ajax requests
[04:11:56] <_pash> doug65536_: ok, how do i clean the cache if i need to update?
[04:12:14] <doug65536_> _pash: you don't "clean" it, you do a cache: false request to bypass the cache
[04:13:26] <doug65536_> _pash: if you specify cache: false, it will force it to get it from the server, even if you have it cached
[04:14:21] <_pash> doug65536_: thanks, what if i have a cache of 20 items, and i need to get 1 new item, its fine if i have cache true
[04:14:28] <seutje> the cache is the browser cache and you can't clear it from within javascript
[04:14:48] <seutje> by specifying cache: false;, jQuery simply adds a randomized query parameter
[04:14:57] <doug65536_> _pash: define 'have'
[04:15:00] <seutje> making the request unique, not hitting the browser cache
[04:15:28] <doug65536_> _pash: "you" don't have a cache. the cache is a part of the browser
[04:15:38] <doug65536_> _pash: unless you mean your own array or something
[04:15:41] <seutje> so this cache depends entirely on the environment/settings of the user and you shouldn't assume it's there, or assume it's not there
[04:17:41] <_pash> seutje: doug65536_: right, so i need to get an array of items on one page, and make sure its there on the other page, however if there is a new item in the array and it loads it, then it has to also be there when another page is loaded
[04:18:28] <seutje> but u can't determine if there's a new item without loading it
[04:18:41] <seutje> can u? o.O
[04:18:42] <doug65536_> _pash: browser caching works by remembering that some url returns some result. if you request an identical url later and it is cached, you will get the cached data
[04:19:02] <Tomashe> doug65536_: thaks aLOTTTTTTTTTT
[04:19:04] <Tomashe> thanks
[04:19:15] <doug65536_> Tomashe: np
[04:19:18] <_pash> seutje: yes, i will have a separate function load it
[04:19:22] <seutje> isn't tak swedish for thanks?
[04:20:01] <seutje> no, danish, it's roof in swedish :x
[04:20:28] <_pash> doug65536_: thanks thats the explanation i needed, then this wont work
[04:20:44] <seutje> _pash: sounds like u want to load it anyway, and just merge it with the one you're keeping around
[04:20:59] <seutje> unless u wanna catch items that disappear
[04:21:04] <doug65536_> _pash: if you pass cache: false, then it will ensure that every url it uses is different, so it won't ever find it in the cache
[04:21:13] <_pash> seutje: yeah there will be items that dissapear in some cases
[04:22:12] <Tomashe> doug65536_: when u get free , i would like to ask u if u can check something but i dont really wanna bother u
[04:22:20] <doug65536_> _pash: I doubt you're doing anything that performance critical. just get it from the server :)
[04:22:26] <xqo> doug65536_ can you explain your sorting-function? heres the link http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/9jRbR/ where does a and b come from, and can you explain the return value?
[04:23:16] <xqo> also what are a and b?
[04:23:29] <doug65536_> xqo: you pass a function to sort. sort takes pairs of items and calls the passed function to see which one is greater. it passes the two items it is comparing to the function. the one I wrote takes two parameters, named a and b
[04:23:40] <doug65536_> line 10 compares the two strings
[04:23:46] <_pash> doug65536_: alrigh
[04:23:50] <_pash> doug65536_: thanks anyway
[04:24:09] <doug65536_> if h2_1 < h2_2, then return -1, else if h2_1 > h2_2 then return 1, else return 0
[04:24:49] <doug65536_> xqo: you could rewrite line 10 across 7 lines
[04:25:26] <xqo> doug65536_ so sort() compares 2 divs at a time to sort?
[04:25:33] <doug65536_> xqo: correct
[04:26:31] <xqo> and then sort() uses magic to compile an array of divs after it has compared 2 and 2 enough times?
[04:26:43] <_pash> doug65536_: one more thing, whats better to use $(document).ready or $(window).load
[04:26:44] <doug65536_> xqo: yes
[04:26:47] <xqo> okej, thank you
[04:27:02] <doug65536_> _pash: use $(function() { ... stuff here ... });
[04:27:21] <doug65536_> _pash: it is shorthand for $(document).ready(function() { ... });
[04:27:32] <_pash> tdy
[04:27:34] <_pash> ty
[04:28:41] <doug65536_> xqo: that same "compare pairs of things to sort" is how it is done in practically every language that lets you customize the sorting
[04:29:48] <doug65536_> xqo: you could do things like, sort by last name, then by first name, etc... if both last names are identical, then compare the first names, etc
[04:30:19] <xqo> in the return statement, what is the question-mark?
[04:30:22] <doug65536_> xqo: if the last names are different, you ignore the first names that time
[04:30:26] <doug65536_> xqo: ternary operator
[04:30:46] <xqo> ok
[04:30:48] <doug65536_> xqo: want me to show you simpler and much more lines method?
[04:31:04] <xqo> doug65536_ yes please
[04:31:08] <xqo> well
[04:31:15] <xqo> not if you're just replacing the return-statement
[04:31:22] <xqo> think i understand it now, hehe.
[04:31:59] <doug65536_> xqo: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/9jRbR/7/
[04:32:16] <xqo> thanks
[04:32:37] <doug65536_> you could omit the { } for single-line if body, but in js I always put them in
[04:32:46] <xqo> doug65536_ i tried to make the version where button sends a parameter instead of checking all buttons, but its not working http://hastebin.com/junovukayo.avrasm
[04:33:23] <doug65536_> xqo: I don't think you should be putting javascript in your html
[04:33:32] <doug65536_> you should attach your handlers in javascript code
[04:34:03] <xqo> doug65536_ i think i want it this way so far
[04:34:06] <doug65536_> onclick etc is the ancient way
[04:34:08] <xqo> for now*
[04:35:01] <xqo> okej, ill thnk about it. but im writing templates for a huge framework, where the javascript will be global for everything in the framework, so i want to touch as little as possible
[04:35:05] <doug65536_> can you show your onclick="... this stuff.." then?
[04:35:27] <xqo> http://hastebin.com/yagamevofu.xml
[04:35:56] <doug65536_> xqo: you aren't passing a parameter
[04:36:15] <doug65536_> xqo: your onclick="... this stuff ..." are all wrong
[04:36:18] <_pash> doug65536_: generally is it better to keep cache on or off for ajax requests? taking into account the possibility that the response is an array that could change everytime, cache off?
[04:36:23] * Successful is now away, auto-away after 20 minutes (log\on pager\on)
[04:36:43] <doug65536_> make them all onclick="sort_productlist(this)"
[04:37:01] * seutje makes a hissing sound
[04:37:10] <doug65536_> xqo: actually, no
[04:37:26] <doug65536_> xqo: what's wrong with the code I gave you? that way is terrible imho
[04:37:42] <doug65536_> xqo: you want to litter your html with javascript?
[04:38:20] <xqo> yeah, for now.
[04:38:23] <doug65536_> xqo: where is the script? before? after?
[04:38:32] <doug65536_> the second sort doesn't pass any parameter
[04:38:48] <xqo> 2nd sort is just leftover from testing
[04:38:50] <doug65536_> the second sort doesn't call your function
[04:39:12] <doug65536_> ok what is wrong then
[04:39:48] <fuchstronaut> I am returning (echo) an array using json_encode() via AJAX, but in my success callback function my array is a stirng, whatamadoingwrong?!
[04:39:48] <xqo> well the script doesnt sort when i click the button, hehe..
[04:40:29] <doug65536_> xqo: line 2 and line 8 are missing the dot before product: .product
[04:40:44] <xqo> oh
[04:40:46] <xqo> thanks!
[04:41:07] <cameron262> hello what's the best way to make a text input stay in the center of the page? i have this: http://jsfiddle.net/MJhEQ/3/
[04:41:14] <cameron262> but if you hold down a key it will not update until after you let go
[04:41:23] <cameron262> and also if you type a word longer than the width of a textbox then the line will be ignored and the height of the textbox will be one line less than it should be
[04:41:28] <motaka2> does this selects even unchecked checkboxes?  var inputs = $('#egyUnitsShlsInfoFormsForm :input');
[04:42:37] <fuchstronaut> guys im serious,why the heck am i not getting an object back?
[04:42:42] <cameron262> oh the first problem can be solved with break-word
[04:43:08] <doug65536_> fuchstronaut: I suggest exit(json_encode(...));
[04:43:14] <seutje> cameron262: bind on keyup and keydown
[04:43:36] <cameron262> seutje, that wont help
[04:44:07] <doug65536_> motaka2: remove the colon
[04:44:14] <fuchstronaut> doug65536_: thanks, but thats not the solution. I forced the header(), now it works, just wondering why i never had to do that before
[04:44:14] <jigal> hi I am trying to make my object draggable. Like here: http://jsfiddle.net/zVZFq/670/ but it doesn't work
[04:44:17] <motaka2> fuchstronaut: are you sure on PHP side you are using an array in json_encode ? like json_encode(array('foo'=->"bar")) ?
[04:44:19] <jigal> any idea's?
[04:44:50] <doug65536_> fuchstronaut: I never said it was the solution. exiting with the json prevents bugs where it falls through and crap is emitted after the json
[04:45:39] <motaka2> doug65536_: I think it should be with colon , else it wouldnt select select
[04:46:11] <doug65536_> motaka2: ok, I thought you meant to select input tags
[04:46:56] <doug65536_> motaka2: wasn't thinking straight :D
[04:47:14] <motaka2> doug65536_: no problem, thanks for you care
[04:48:20] <rix_> hi, any idea what is wrong with this function please? - http://pastebin.com/eE2gVTzN
[04:48:28] <rix_> The error is SyntaxError: missing : after property id
[04:50:00] <doug65536_> rix_: remove the extra { around the two functions
[04:50:22] <doug65536_> rix_: and remove the comma after the second function
[04:50:23] <seutje> cameron262: http://jsfiddle.net/MJhEQ/6/ works for me, it seems
[04:50:41] <jigal> hi I am trying to make my object draggable. Like here: http://jsfiddle.net/zVZFq/670/ . it runs the constructor but it doesn't let me drag
[04:51:09] <doug65536_> rix_: hover takes two parameters, why are you passing a single object with syntax errors :)
[04:51:18] <cameron262> oh awesome thank you!
[04:51:48] <rix_> doug65536_: > chosen answer with 6 votes - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2567518/how-to-tell-if-a-mouse-is-hovering-over-an-element
[04:52:09] <doug65536_> rix_: yes, do you see a { on the first line?
[04:52:24] <doug65536_> 3rd line is wrong too
[04:52:33] <doug65536_> rix_: upvotes don't mean correct
[04:52:59] <rix_> i'm having so many problems with mouseover.  it seems it doesn't fire if the mouse is over the element at bind time
[04:53:00] <doug65536_> rix_: trust me, that code on stackoverflow is garbage
[04:53:04] <rix_> i don't know what to do
[04:53:19] <doug65536_> rix_: I told you the errors
[04:54:09] <rix_> doug65536_: yeah but it doesn't solve the problem i am on all morning, which is that mouseover just doesn't seem to fire consistently
[04:54:19] <doug65536_> rix_: use this: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/4cnQ6/
[04:55:18] <motaka2> is this event wrong?   $("input:checkbox").off("click", "input:checkbox").on("click", "input:checkbox", function() {
[04:55:29] <rix_> doug65536_: thanks
[04:56:28] <motaka2> doug65536_: may you please answer me?
[04:58:59] <doug65536_> motaka2: answer what
[04:59:11] <doug65536_> checkbox thing?
[05:00:35] <kemak> How can I add more then one attribute to .css()? I tried this with no luck $('.view-submit').css('background':'#059000', 'color':'#fff');
[05:00:38] <Cork> motaka2: you can't have inputs as children to inputs, so ya it is wrong
[05:00:50] <Cork> kemak: give it an object
[05:00:58] <xqo> how do i select the parent .dynamic_productlist of the button on line 4? http://hastebin.com/yurogewobo.xml
[05:01:01] <kemak> what does that mean?
[05:01:02] <Cork> { property: value, property: value }
[05:01:16] <kemak> am not following you, that is what I have done?
[05:01:22] <md4d> hej buddies, as mentioned last week i wrote a pjax lib which can replace multiple id containers and head elements with just one request. i really like to get some feedback to improve that lib. so if you are interested, please take a look: https://github.com/minddust/jquery-pjaxr
[05:01:53] <Cork> kemak: no, you give it invalid arguments
[05:02:01] <Cork> kemak: js isn't implicit
[05:02:48] <Cork> xqo: closest('.dynamic_productlist')
[05:02:59] <doug65536_> motaka2: I just tried it http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/M7XGX/3/
[05:03:10] <doug65536_> motaka2: I get all of the objects, checked or not
[05:03:46] <Cork> doug65536_: you want :checked, not just :input
[05:03:59] <doug65536_> Cork: read motaka2's question
[05:04:05] <doug65536_> Cork: do I misunderstand?
[05:04:34] <Cork> doug65536_: unless we read different questions it was about event listeners not selectors
[05:04:59] <doug65536_> I thought the question was, will :input find unchecked checkboxes
[05:05:47] <Cork> doug65536_: $("input:checkbox").off("click", "input:checkbox").on("click", "input:checkbox", <-- this won't ever match anything
[05:05:49] <doug65536_> <motaka2> does this selects even unchecked checkboxes?  var inputs = $('#egyUnitsShlsInfoFormsForm :input');
[05:05:56] <Cork> so ya different questions :)
[05:06:22] <doug65536_> Cork: ok, so I didn't twist the question around in my head then lol
[05:07:34] <doug65536_> Cork: I've been known to answer something other than what was asked so I never doubt it if someone says I'm answering wrong question :D
[05:07:44] <Cork> XD
[05:07:55] <Cork> well at lest you answer something ;)
[05:08:37] <alwis> hello

[05:17:45] <polpotter> How do I redirect after a facebook login?
[05:18:40] <doug65536> kemak: $('.view-submit').css({'background':'#059000', 'color':'#fff'})
[05:21:04] <doug65536> xqo: to get them as a string "450,- NOK".match(/^(\d+)/)[0]
[05:21:13] <doug65536> xqo: to get them as a number +"450,- NOK".match(/^(\d+)/)[0]
[05:21:21] <xqo> thank you
[05:22:37] <xqo> .match does not take the regex as string?
[05:22:47] <seutje> regex is a type of its own
[05:22:49] <xqo> .match(my regex)
[05:22:50] <xqo> okej
[05:22:55] <doug65536> xqo: no, javascript has native regex support
[05:22:56] <xqo> .match("my regex") i meant
[05:22:59] <xqo> alright thanks
[05:23:13] <Chousuke> ugh. Is there a sane way to use d3 together with jquery mobile?
[05:23:36] <doug65536> xqo: it could
[05:23:39] <xqo> how do i match any non-integer character?
[05:23:41] <seutje> js> print(typeof (+"450,- NOK"))
[05:23:47] <b-ot> seutje: number
[05:23:50] <seutje> why the match?
[05:24:07] <Chousuke> I can't get my visualizations to consistently render. sometimes it doesn't trigger a pageinit event when I change a page, but apparently the page has been removed from the DOM :/
[05:26:14] <seutje> doug65536: why the regex?
[05:26:29] <Chousuke> I'm quite thoroughly confused as to how this is supposed to work.
[05:26:34] <doug65536> seutje: strictness
[05:26:59] <seutje> does the match run first, or does it cast first?
[05:27:13] <seutje> js> print(+"450,- NOK".match(/^(\d+)/)[0])
[05:27:17] <doug65536> seutje: unary + is right associative
[05:27:20] <b-ot> seutje: 450
[05:27:34] <seutje> oh, right
[05:28:02] <seutje> so why no parseInt with radix?
[05:28:42] <doug65536> js> print(+"332....")
[05:28:50] <b-ot> doug65536: NaN
[05:29:46] <seutje> js> print(parseInt("332....", 10));
[05:29:52] <b-ot> seutje: 332
[05:30:24] <seutje> just wondering, rly, not trying to troll
[05:30:42] <xqo> doug65536 is it possible to make the sorting-function look smother? like how you can do slideToggle instead of show() / hide() to make a div slide down instead of pop up/disappear
[05:31:41] <doug65536> seutje: I'm not fond of throwing strings with trailing garbage at parseInt, even if it works. it's no big deal really, parseInt is fine too
[05:32:19] <seutje> I see
[05:33:08] <doug65536> xqo: you could pull it off but it would be fairly complicated I think
[05:33:16] <seutje> my coworkers aren't too fond of coercion hacks
[05:33:36] <seutje> I get a lotta shit for doing things like +'345 blabla'
[05:33:38] <doug65536> seutje: implicit conversions are of the devil :D
[05:33:59] <seutje> I know, but if u've been doing JS for a while, you should know, and know how to use them
[05:34:06] <doug65536> seutje: but blanket hating parts of a language are bad too. if it reliably works, use it
[05:34:13] <seutje> exactly
[05:34:44] <seutje> hell, I even get shit for doing var foo, bar, meh, poo;
[05:34:56] <doug65536> seutje: really? lol
[05:34:56] <seutje> instead of var foo; var bar; var meh; ...
[05:35:00] <xqo> doug65536 i tried this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1520178/jquery-using-append-with-effects
[05:35:07] <xqo> doug65536 didnt work though: the sliding is at the bottom http://hastebin.com/cudayicuqi.coffee
[05:35:44] <doug65536> seutje: I've done years of C and C++ work. I am 100% comfortable with ternary, but people whine about it sometimes
[05:35:56] <doug65536> "too hard to understand"
[05:36:07] <doug65536> really? you don't know the language, and that's my fault? lol
[05:37:33] <doug65536> xqo: I can make my code smoother if you want to see if you like it
[05:37:43] <xqo> yeah sure
[05:38:39] <andern> does an offline coding environment similar to jsfiddle exist? hopefully with "live update" of the result-field?
[05:38:42] <seutje> doug65536: oh yeah, get shit for that as well
[05:39:15] <seutje> but if I assume PHP array order, I'm the one being silly
[05:41:15] <doug65536> xqo: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/9jRbR/10/
[05:41:51] <xqo> doug65536 only difference is the .slideDown ?
[05:42:12] <doug65536> xqo: wait... screwed up the sort
[05:43:23] <doug65536> xqo: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/9jRbR/12/
[05:43:53] <doug65536> xqo: yes, 3 differences that are important...
[05:43:59] <xqo> slideup and slidedown?
[05:44:43] <doug65536> xqo: 1) it does slideUp, 2) sets it up so rest of code only runs after slideUp is done, sorts them, 3) slides down
[05:44:54] <xqo> doug65536 okay thanks!! it looks very nice
[05:45:07] <alwis> i need to replace $.browser.msie. but i dont know with what. has anybody an hint?
[05:45:08] <doug65536> xqo: np
[05:45:24] <alwis> i need it for canvas
[05:51:49] <kemak> http://pastebin.com/kdA212yk am trying to toggle using .click(), I have a feeling I've done this before with success. Can anyone see anything?
[05:53:34] <doug65536> kemak: why are there two functions?
[05:54:38] <kemak> doug65536: I was thinking I could do the same with click as with hover
[05:55:05] <doug65536> kemak: no, click doesn't take two functions
[05:55:14] <seutje> ?toggle
[05:55:24] <doug65536> you want it to animate one way on mousedown and the other way on mouse up?
[05:55:45] <kemak> nope, on click.
[05:55:57] <doug65536> kemak: that doesn't make a lot of sense
[05:56:09] <seutje> kemak: http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[05:56:16] <seutje> I never use it though
[05:56:24] <doug65536> just put both animates in one function and it will queue them up I think
[05:56:25] <seutje> oh wait, it's removed lol
[05:56:29] <seutje> NEVAMIND :D
[05:57:22] <kemak> http://pastebin.com/NN4psZhx
[05:57:24] <kemak> I tried this
[05:57:25] <doug65536> kemak: if it doesn't queue them up, pass an options object with queue:true
[05:57:31] <kemak> ill give you a showcase
[05:57:32] <kemak> sec
[05:59:10] <kemak> http://jsfiddle.net/AzsEM/
[05:59:18] <kemak> when I click the image it is suppose to expand to height 300
[05:59:38] <seutje> kemak: http://pastebin.com/rPcJvgM9
[05:59:44] <seutje> use the closure!
[06:00:14] <kemak> Why?
[06:00:30] <LoneSoldier728> hey so I am trying to go back and forth between a button meaning to switch them out based on what is showing
[06:00:37] <LoneSoldier728> it doesnt work when I want to switch back
[06:00:38] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/PFCspwSB
[06:01:00] <seutje> kemak: cause it allows u to keep track of state without leaking it to the global scope
[06:01:18] <LoneSoldier728> when clicking on search labels it shows it, then searchContacts button seems to be disabled
[06:01:24] <kemak> currently when I click on the image it disappear now.
[06:01:33] <kemak> the toggle is removing the element not animating
[06:02:35] <seutje> kemak: toggle is for animating, it takes an options object, the toggle event was removed
[06:03:02] <seutje> but toggle just used the same basic idea I did
[06:03:17] <kemak> seutje: so how do I solve this?
[06:03:18] <seutje> store an array of callback and just pop that sucker
[06:03:29] <seutje> kemak: u open the last pastebin I pasted
[06:04:24] <alwis> i have many errors with $('... since i included jquery directly from http://code.jquery.com/ could that be, because its not from my own domain?
[06:04:39] <alwis> $ is not a function
[06:04:47] <seutje> kemak: http://jsfiddle.net/AzsEM/10/
[06:05:22] <seutje> alwis: is jQuery defined?
[06:06:06] <LoneSoldier728> anyone know my issue : /
[06:06:16] <doug65536> kemak, seutje http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/AzsEM/14/
[06:06:20] <alwis> seutje: im not sure, i changed nothing in the code
[06:07:30] <alwis> something like that: var $jq = jQuery.noConflict(); i read that solves the problem
[06:07:35] <kemak> seutje: in that example you posted, notice that you have to click twice to close something if you have several divs expanded.
[06:07:59] <doug65536> kemak: did you try my code?
[06:08:27] <kemak> doug65536: yes it did work. Funny thing
[06:08:58] <dwt> Hi there, I seem to be running into a browser optimization issue (or something similar). That is when I call .height() on an element before a debugger statement and then again after the debugger has stopped - I get different values.
[06:09:21] <dwt> Google hasn't helped me so far in figuring out how to get monotonous behaviour here, could one of you perhaps give me a hint?
[06:09:32] <dwt> This happens on Safari and Chrome
[06:13:30] <seutje> kemak: oh, u want state per item?
[06:13:56] <sacho> dwt, maybe debugger; forces a paint.
[06:14:57] <dwt> sacho: quite likely
[06:15:14] <sacho> Well,how to work around this depends on what you want to achieve
[06:15:44] <dwt> sacho: Actually I was under the impression that a reflow should be triggered by asking css values and that that should already settle the values
[06:16:13] <dwt> I suppose I could delay this computation with something like setTimeout(cssfix, 0)
[06:16:20] <sacho> yeah
[06:16:24] <dwt> but that would show a flicker :/
[06:16:47] <sacho> I assume you want the post-debugger height()?
[06:17:47] <dwt> jup
[06:18:03] <dwt> I have tried to force a reflow by asking various css values
[06:18:08] <dwt> but that doesn't seem to have any effect
[06:18:28] <dwt> maybe I need to ask them of a parent object....
[06:18:41] <dwt> Could that perhaps help? (testing right now)
[06:19:32] <dwt> nope
[06:19:58] <sacho> is the element visible?
[06:20:11] <sacho> hmm, debugger shouldnt affect that
[06:20:21] <dwt> yes it is
[06:20:23] <dwt> oh
[06:20:37] <dwt> actually, asking the parents parents scrolltop does seem to work
[06:20:51] <dwt> to force it to give me the height like it was after the debugger statement halted
[06:20:57] <dwt> strange
[06:20:57] <sacho> you know I'm not sure height() is asking for offsetHeight every time
[06:21:01] <seutje> kemak: there, state per element: http://jsfiddle.net/AzsEM/15/ (should probably instantiate a constructor and keep things in their instance)
[06:21:28] <kemak> seutje and doug65536  thank you both, ill look into these!
[06:21:44] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/PFCspwSB
[06:21:49] <LoneSoldier728> anyone know what is wrong with that code
[06:21:53] <LoneSoldier728> because the buttons
[06:22:02] <LoneSoldier728> should be switching off based on which one is showing
[06:22:23] <dwt> very wierd… asking for the .scrollTop() of the element before the calculation now seems to have fixed things
[06:22:37] <seutje> LoneSoldier728: missing }); at the end?
[06:22:44] <dwt> fixed == worked around
[06:23:05] <dwt> while before it didn't work while I tried to debug this
[06:23:10] <seutje> LoneSoldier728: why is this the same thing twice?
[06:23:57] <LoneSoldier728> what thing
[06:24:08] <LoneSoldier728> searchLabels vs searchContacts?
[06:24:36] <xqo> doug65536 are you here?
[06:24:54] <dwt> ah damnit….. I missed something, now the code wasn't run at all. :-(
[06:25:00] <dwt> So that's not a workaround yet
[06:25:01] <doug65536> xqo: yes
[06:25:38] <doug65536> xqo: a bit preoccupied though, might be slow to respond
[06:25:40] <sacho> dwt, have you tried asking for offsetHeight on the dom element explicitly, instead of using height()?
[06:25:44] <xqo> doug65536 the sliding in the sort-function is cool, but is it possible to make the size of the div-area remain? i have this bar at the bottom, and when i slide down/up the bar follows after and it looks a little disturbing
[06:26:17] <doug65536> xqo: I think so
[06:26:18] <Chousuke> to what event am I supposed to bind a function when using jquery mobile if I want it to execute so that I can dynamically add elements on a webpage?
[06:26:24] <dwt> sacho: not yet, trying that now
[06:26:27] <doug65536> xqo: give me 10 or 20 min
[06:26:28] <LoneSoldier728> @seutje what thing?
[06:26:34] <xqo> doug65536 okej!
[06:27:07] <dwt> sacho: it's reported wrong too
[06:27:09] <dwt> :-)
[06:27:17] <Chousuke> pageinit doesn't help since the bindings either execute too many times (if I bind on document) or not at all (if I bind on the page id) :/
[06:27:26] <netiul> hm, can i add a key to sizeRelatedOptions obj which reside in the anonymous function wrapping the dialog widget?
[06:27:56] <netiul> i mean, i can't figure out how to access it :)
[06:28:50] <dwt> sacho: Just so I don't get it wrong: That should have been the obvious way to force a reflow of the relevant dom node, right?
[06:28:57] <dwt> (parent nodes report wrong heights too)
[06:29:07] <sacho> as far as I know
[06:29:56] <dwt> Do you have any other idea then? Otherwise I'm probably left with the flickr from the setTimeout workaround
[06:30:08] <dwt> I know I'm out of ideas. :-)
[06:30:34] <emx> when an <img /> element has no loadable source then it is not displayed (in firefox). is there a way to ask the browser if the image was not loaded?
[06:30:51] <emx> (or if there is no imaga data displayed in <img />)
[06:33:08] <dwt> Well in that case, many thanks for your time and help
[06:33:12] <LoneSoldier728> http://jsfiddle.net/xh7fP/
[06:33:21] <LoneSoldier728> anyone able to figure out why the button doesnt change back
[06:33:30] <LoneSoldier728> I put the code in js fiddle
[06:33:34] <LoneSoldier728> so it can be messed with
[06:34:15] <LoneSoldier728> http://jsfiddle.net/xh7fP/1/ here
[06:34:17] <LoneSoldier728> i updated it
[06:36:08] <Saaether> LoneSoldier728 http://jsfiddle.net/xh7fP/2/
[06:36:32] <emx> just noticed: when i click on an element that opens a dialog (jquery ui) i can close it by hitting escape.
[06:36:40] <LoneSoldier728> oh nice
[06:36:44] <LoneSoldier728> so I need the document on
[06:36:51] <LoneSoldier728> I have them wrapped already in a document ready?
[06:36:52] <emx> as soon as i click the triggering element a second time the dialog can't be closed with escape anymore.
[06:36:57] <Saaether> you're working with dynamically created content so you need to use on
[06:37:19] <Saaether> `api on @ LoneSoldier728
[06:37:19] <b-ot> LoneSoldier728: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[06:37:28] <LoneSoldier728> ah kk
[06:42:42] <doug65536> xqo: back
[06:43:09] <xqo> doug65536 shall i link you anything?
[06:44:43] <doug65536> xqo: last fiddle I posted :)
[06:44:54] <xqo> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/9jRbR/12/
[06:46:48] <jop008> Notice: Undefined index: owner  owner is in the url and this is the line   $owner = $_GET["owner"];
[06:51:22] <sacho> jop008, and you seriously can't debug this?
[06:51:38] <sacho> what's the url? did you var_dump($_GET)?
[06:51:57] <sacho> oh, and also, ##php
[07:00:55] <reesefrancis> hello, if I'm inside a click handler of a button, which one is faster? $(this).parent().find(".className") or just $(".className")?
[07:01:07] <berryciderspider> How can I redirect users to a specific page after they log in using facebook?
[07:02:28] <seutje> reesefrancis: they don't accomplish the same thing
[07:02:45] <seutje> reesefrancis: $(".className") searches for elements with that class document-wide
[07:02:55] <seutje> the other only searches within the scope of the direct parent of the button
[07:03:05] <reesefrancis> seutje, yes I know, but in my case they do, since the only .className elements are inside that parent()
[07:03:28] <reesefrancis> and I was wondering if it's worth using $(this).parent().find or if it doesn't help at all
[07:03:35] <sacho> why are you microoptimizing?
[07:03:37] <doug65536> xqo: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/9jRbR/
[07:04:00] <reesefrancis> sacho, I'm curious to know if there's a difference, implementation-wise
[07:04:11] <seutje> reesefrancis: it'll depend heavily on the size of the document and the browser
[07:04:12] <xqo> doug65536 thanks!!
[07:04:19] <doug65536> xqo: np
[07:04:21] <sacho> The first one clearly states the intent of the code without quite possibly interfering with future changes to the dom
[07:04:40] <seutje> reesefrancis: personally, I'd use the first, even if it is less performant in some situations
[07:04:41] <Bloomberg> Morning guys!!
[07:04:59] <seutje> the difference will be marginal and the difference in maintainability vastly outweighs is
[07:05:03] <seutje> s/is/it
[07:05:18] <reesefrancis> seutje, sacho, fair enough, thanks a lot :)
[07:05:47] <seutje> reesefrancis: if u wanna know for sure, create a test  case on jsperf, and try to match the structure of your document as closely as possible
[07:05:56] <seutje> then have ppl run it on different platforms/browsers
[07:06:24] <Bloomberg> someone has worked before with jTablet Jquery plugin?
[07:06:57] <doug65536> xqo: removed a couple of unnecessary variables http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/9jRbR/
[07:07:21] <doug65536> xqo: if you want regular speed, remove 'fast' parameters
[07:07:31] <Bloomberg> I have a problem with filtering records!
[07:09:37] <pachet> reesefrancis in this case the second would almost certainly be faster
[07:09:47] <pachet> just because its fewer function calls and maps directly to a native dom method
[07:10:14] <pachet> if you were doing this without jquery, and you stored a reference to the parent element, element.getElementsByClassName would be faster
[07:10:19] <pachet> but not dramatically so
[07:10:53] <doug65536> what are you guys talking about optimizing?
[07:11:05] <xqo> doug65536 okej!
[07:11:41] <pachet> doug65536: $(this).parent().find(".className") vs $(".className")
[07:11:55] <pachet> s/optimizing/microoptimizing :p

[07:21:51] <henn1nk> seutje: is there another way to archieve this?
[07:22:04] <seutje> henn1nk: use a promise
[07:22:11] <henn1nk> seutje: ?
[07:22:24] <seutje> $(foo).html(bar).promise().done(function() { doStuffAfterHtmlIsDone(); })

[07:24:53] <henn1nk> seutje: https://gist.github.com/henn1nk/6231437 ?
[07:26:20] <doug65536> xqo: really no var? you are putting a ton of garbage in the window object
[07:27:02] <xqo> var does something? i thought it was a relic left behind for compatibility
[07:27:28] <Technical_13> GIGO
[07:27:35] <Technical_13> ...
[07:28:49] <seutje> henn1nk: should work
[07:28:58] <henn1nk> seutje: but i am using css transitions
[07:29:01] <seutje> can obviously be made more elegant, but should work
[07:29:08] <henn1nk> seutje: i believe i will not recognise this or?
[07:29:16] <henn1nk> it
[07:29:27] <seutje> henn1nk: sure, but the class will only be applied for like a picosecond

[07:36:49] <doug65536> xqo: that slideDown will happen way too early
[07:37:09] <doug65536> xqo: the click handler returns long before the animation even starts happening
[07:37:37] <xqo> doug65536 well when the sorting started working, i moved it to where im really going to use it, and not in the pseudo-code sandbox i was using. had to adapt it to match the new template
[07:45:37] <spobat> how do i select the element where data-foo="3" is true ?
[07:46:23] <spobat> $("div[data-role='footer']") ty
[07:46:30] <farmer-duck> $('*[data-customerID="22"]');
[07:48:35] <doug65536> xqo: I guess this will work. I have no way to test it http://hastebin.com/dokimovovu.coffee
[07:49:07] <doug65536> xqo: fixed typo http://hastebin.com/yenedefilu.coffee
[07:50:45] <doug65536> xqo: if it doesn't work, I would appreciate if you made a jsfiddle with html that matches your scenario so I can test/fix it
[07:52:31] <johanbr> Hi. I'm a beginner with jquery and I have a slideToggle animation that's jerky for some reason: http://jsfiddle.net/5YSAT/
[07:52:56] <doug65536> xqo: you can fork my fiddle and make all the changes you like to it. even if you don't fork it, it won't matter, saves always save a new fiddle
[07:53:06] <xqo> doug65536 okey
[07:53:11] <xqo> thanks alot for your time btw
[07:53:17] <xqo> you made my day much easier hehe
[07:53:19] <johanbr> Clicking the top plus sign reveals the content below, but with a jerk at the beginning. If anyone could tell me what I'm doing wrong, it'd be much appreciated.
[07:53:20] <doug65536> xqo: np
[07:53:26] <xqo> doug65536 i changed slideDown/slideUp to fadeOut/fadeIn btw. it looks very nice
[07:53:38] <xqo> makes the height-stuff not necessary
[07:53:47] <doug65536> xqo: ok
[07:56:13] <doug65536> xqo:  you could have told me that before I wasted time reverse engineering what you changed and fixing the bugs in your hastebin
[07:56:39] <xqo> doug65536 i just tried it, i couldnt pull off your last code either
[07:59:06] <t4nk247> hi
[07:59:12] <Bloomberg> hi guys!!
[07:59:35] <t4nk247> Someone help me?
[08:00:11] <Bloomberg> t4nk247: you know work jquery  fine?
[08:00:35] <doug65536> t4nk247: help you what
[08:00:37] <t4nk247> yes, my question is like .click i can make with load
[08:00:51] <t4nk247> the selector this
[08:01:05] <Bloomberg> t4nk247: you have worked before with jTable Jquery plugin?
[08:01:12] <t4nk247> ni
[08:01:14] <t4nk247> no
[08:01:22] <doug65536> t4nk247: show fiddle
[08:01:46] <t4nk247> wait a second
[08:01:52] <doug65536> t4nk247: is the thing you are .load()'ing in another domain?
[08:01:56] <Roots47> Hey guys, is it possible to use a closure as a callback in an event handler to create a unique set of variables per element? http://jsfiddle.net/FGjC7/1/  I want to have a unique instance of 'isVisible" per "my_container"
[08:02:08] <doug65536> Roots47: yes
[08:02:14] <Bloomberg> Someone here has worked with jquery jTable plugin?
[08:02:19] <Roots47> doug65536: Could you tell me what's wrong with the code in that fiddle?
[08:02:29] <t4nk247> http://jsfiddle.net/DansVC/WGLKH/2/
[08:02:52] <t4nk247> in click I would like to put .load
[08:02:56] <t4nk247> but dont work
[08:03:36] <sarahm_22> Hello, i'm tryin to access some elements in an xml doc , how could i write the following xpath :  "/item/@id" . in my xml i have somethin like " <item id="foo">  and i want to get "foo".
[08:04:31] <doug65536> Roots47: this should work or be really close http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/FGjC7/2/
[08:04:38] <doug65536> Roots47: not sure where angular comes from
[08:05:10] <doug65536> Roots47: you aren't modifying isVisible in the click handler, but if you did, each thing would have its own isVisible
[08:05:16] <ruby_on_tails> something funny is happening. I am loading jquery ui after jquery 1.7.1 -> <script src="js/jquery.js"></script> <script src="js/jui/js/jquery-ui-1.8.17.custom.min.js"></script> i can click on the jquery ui url in the browser code view and land up on the proper js file, but in console if i do typeof jQuery.ui it says undefined, why ?
[08:05:20] <Roots47> doug65536: kk
[08:05:48] <ruby_on_tails> jquery ui version is 1.8.17
[08:06:48] <doug65536> Roots47: wait, you asked an angular question in jquery?
[08:06:58] <doug65536> Roots47: is jquery functionality available in angular?
[08:07:10] <Roots47> doug65536: yes, it is… and this question is not specific to angular by any means
[08:07:31] <Roots47> doug65536: It comes with 'jquerylite', but in my case we have jquery full installed
[08:07:36] <doug65536> Roots47: yes I know, it's a closure question, but my answer relies on $.each
[08:07:47] <Roots47> doug65536: Yep, I have $.each, no worries
[08:08:02] <doug65536> k
[08:08:57] <doug65536> Roots47: the trick is, the each callback creates a separate function scope per callback - and the bind call closure captures isVisible. make sense?
[08:11:30] <doug65536> Roots47: I answered almost the same question earlier http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/WPhns/
[08:14:56] <henn1nk> how can i call an fuction after scrolled 5px down of top?
[08:15:12] <henn1nk> at the moment i use plugin waypoints, but this needs an element?
[08:15:20] <prbc> Hey, does anybody here knows select2? I'm trying to load select items from an API but nothing shows up. Can someone help me? http://jsfiddle.net/4MnMp/
[08:15:21] <DarkGhost`> I'm trying to use Jquery Migrate and it keeps telling me thinds have been depreciated but I can't find them in my code..
[08:16:10] <NetQT> Hello, Could someone say how  can I attach click handler to the element that is being loaded by ajax?
[08:16:31] <NetQT> I used live() before, but it's depracted now
[08:17:47] <daveAway> $(".parentthing").on("click",".thing" function(){  ---   });
[08:17:48] <daveAway> i think
[08:18:33] <prbc> NetQT: Just bind it after load, like $ajax({}).dont(function(){bind();})
[08:18:51] <prbc> NetQT: sorry, done*
[08:19:41] <NetQT> prbc, I cannot change that part of the code
[08:20:54] <jop008> On the server site I generate strings holding <br/> on the client it is not rendered as such I see <br/> in stead of a linebreak
[08:21:38] <ermik> Hello guys. I'm really bored trying to solve a problem. I have elements with similar class names i.e. ".level-basic" ".level-advanced", and I want to select those. I am a fan of shortening and simplifying, so I'm trying to do something like css'  "[attribute~=level
[08:22:53] <ermik> but that works on attributes only, you cant write [class~=level]. So I am looking for advice on how to write this in the most laconic way
[08:23:44] <jop008> Is it because I use .text in stead of .html()?
[08:24:00] <DarkGhost`> NetQT I have that same problem.. what replaces .live?
[08:24:24] <prbc> NetQT: You cant bind elements that doesnt exist, so you have to bind after it loads, no matter how. Maybe you can use a timeout, but I dont think it's the best way
[08:25:03] <prbc> jop008: Probably
[08:25:16] <DarkGhost`> prbc what replaces .live()?
[08:25:29] <Bloomberg> Someone here has worked with jquery jTable plugin?
[08:25:40] <daveAway> .on("click",
[08:25:42] <daveAway> replaces it
[08:26:01] <NetQT> I'm trying .on, but it's now working
[08:26:21] <daveAway> $('.myclass').on("click", function(){});
[08:26:57] <daveAway> oh , i got a question.. newDiv.find('img').load(function(){  < using that should wait for my img to load first before continuing?
[08:27:06] <idbentley> NetQT, if it isn't on the DOM when you bind the event, do something like $('body').on('click', '.myclass', function(){});
[08:27:11] <prbc> DarkGhost`: .on('event', function(){})
[08:27:27] <idbentley> the closer that body is to where the element actually gets bound on the dom, the more efficient that will be
[08:28:45] <NetQT> THANK YOUUUUUUUUUU, SAVED MY LIFE!!!!!!!
[08:29:01] <idbentley> NetQT, Do you understand why that works?
[08:29:22] <NetQT> yes, I think its start listening for changes inside body
[08:29:23] <daveAway> i did post that further up
[08:29:40] <NetQT> im I right?
[08:29:42] <prbc> Does anyone here knows select2?
[08:29:45] * daveAway whines
[08:30:11] <daveAway> newDiv.find('img').load(function(){ that should wait for the image to load
[08:30:13] <Rejected> is there a way to pass a json encoded string from PHP to jQuery using an AJAX call ($.ajax)?
[08:30:14] <daveAway> before it moves on right?
[08:30:39] <doug65536> Rejected: json_encode
[08:32:08] <Rejected> doug65536 yes, that's not the problem, I got the string generated from a PHP array, I'm looking for a way to pass said string to jQuery using AJAX.. meaning, pass back the encoded array to jQuery to work with the values?
[08:32:28] <Rejected> is it possible?
[08:32:32] <doug65536> Rejected: of course
[08:33:17] <Rejected> and how would I go about it if I wanted to send the array to the same page where the ajax call is made from?
[08:33:22] <doug65536> Rejected: $.post(my_url, ajax_params, function(data,status) { ... completion handler ... } , 'json');
[08:33:26] <Rejected> what would the url parameter be like?
[08:33:41] <doug65536> Rejected: or $.get
[08:34:15] <doug65536> Rejected: it would be a string, like 'foo.php'
[08:34:28] <doug65536> Rejected: just like any url
[08:34:30] <Rejected> ok
[08:34:53] <Rejected> I thought there might be another keyword when you want to post to self
[08:35:10] <Rejected> which is what I'm trying to do
[08:35:11] <doug65536> Rejected: pass an empty string to post to "yourself" (this page)
[08:35:27] <Rejected> ok
[08:35:32] <doug65536> Rejected: I think, pretty sure
[08:35:37] <Rejected> tks a lot doug65536, I'll try it out :)
[08:35:53] <ermik_> Should I repeat my question?
[08:36:49] <doug65536> ermik_: you would have to be slightly more specific
[08:37:01] <doug65536> ermik_: find things with a specific class?
[08:37:27] <alexr2> Anyone here used ace?
[08:37:46] <doug65536> ermik_: to find things with class foo is easy: $('.foo')
[08:37:47] <ermik_> doug65536: yes, find divs with classes ".level-basic, .level-adavnced"
[08:38:06] <doug65536> ermik_: find all with either class?
[08:38:23] <doug65536> ermik_: use what you said, $('.level-basic, .level-advanced')
[08:38:40] <ermik_> doug65536: yes, but i dont what to write it like $(".class1, .class2") cus they are named similarly
[08:39:18] <doug65536> ermik_: why not?
[08:39:29] <doug65536> ermik_: so what if they are named similarly?
[08:39:40] <jedimind> you can use wildcar?
[08:39:41] <jedimind> d
[08:39:42] <ermik_> doug65536: I can do that, I know I can. I'm just curious
[08:39:53] <doug65536> ermik_: what's the question
[08:40:47] <ermik_> doug65536: sec, I'll post a link
[08:40:48] <doug65536> jedimind: too vague
[08:40:50] <jedimind> $('[class^=level]
[08:40:53] <jop008> Is there a md5 function at the client?
[08:40:58] <jedimind> well shit son, what do you want
[08:40:59] <jedimind> :)
[08:41:20] <doug65536> class attribute starts with level?
[08:41:25] <doug65536> what if there are multiple classes
[08:41:26] <ermik_> doug65536: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-prefix-selector/
[08:41:30] <jnjoh> Hey everybody, I am encountering an issue with sub-menus in a menu bar. What is happening is the Account sub-menu is by default displaying its content, which should not be displayed until account is hovered over. I want it to work in the same way the Help menu does. http://jsfiddle.net/wq894/
[08:41:37] <jop008> $.md5(password)
[08:41:49] <ermik_> doug65536: I need same thing but for class
[08:41:51] <doug65536> ermik_: WAY more expensive than .class1, .class2
[08:41:57] <ermik_> Oh, okay
[08:42:16] <ermik_> I get what that means. Thanks!
[08:43:51] <DarkGhost`> valueAttrGet = jQuery.attrHooks.value && jQuery.attrHooks.value.get  I can't find anywhere I've used this code and jquery migration is telling me its depreciated
[08:44:26] <Saaether> jnjoh http://jsfiddle.net/wq894/2/
[08:44:48] <Saaether> you messed up a class name in your css
[08:44:58] <Gmac_> hey I'm trying to get a selects val
[08:45:00] <doug65536> jnjoh: that css looks invalid to me

[08:46:26] <DarkGhost`> valueAttrGet = jQuery.attrHooks.value && jQuery.attrHooks.value.get  I can't find anywhere I've used this code and jquery migration is telling me its depreciated
[08:46:42] <doug65536> jnjoh: there is a MUCH better way to store information in elements
[08:46:50] <doug65536> jnjoh: use data- elements
[08:48:13] <DarkGhost`> what replaces jquery.browser?
[08:49:17] <jop008> it is extra javascript
[08:49:19] <tw2113> not sure they replaced it
[08:49:22] <jnjoh> Saaether: Wow... thanks!
[08:50:40] <Gmac_> ok i want to get the text in the curent select dropdown
[08:50:51] <Gmac_> so if the user chooses 2 days. i want to grab '2 days'
[08:50:53] <Gmac_> not the value
[08:50:59] <Gmac_> how can i ?
[08:51:09] <Gmac_> i tried grabbing option.text()
[08:51:15] <Gmac_> i get all of them!
[08:51:34] <tw2113> target the option tag and use .html() ?
[08:52:46] <Gmac_> u! ur everywhere!
[08:52:49] <Gmac_> ahhh!
[08:52:52] <T13> .html() or .text()
[08:52:56] <Gmac_> i tried
[08:53:07] <Gmac_> i have a select.on change
[08:53:23] <Gmac_> then i say this.find('option'
[08:53:27] <Gmac_> but it finds all options
[08:53:39] <Gmac_> i just want the selected option
[08:53:45] <tw2113> then you're not getting specific enough
[08:53:49] <T13> You using this wrong.
[08:54:13] <T13> You need to define this inside a function
[08:54:23] <Gmac_> obviously...
[08:54:27] <Gmac_> I'm just giving u tidbits
[08:54:33] <Gmac_> fine ill use pastebin
[08:54:50] <T13> Might be q good idea.
[08:54:51] <tw2113> jsfiddle please
[08:54:58] <tw2113> not pastebin
[08:55:00] <T13> Even better
[08:55:33] * Gmac_ http://pastebin.com/ZfpfU71F
[08:55:35] <Gmac_> haha
[08:55:37] <Gmac_> sorry
[08:55:46] <Gmac_> but it looks simple
[08:56:16] <ML74> Has anyone got experience with chosen js and uniforms? I'm trying to set the value of a select box programatically with no luck at all...
[08:56:23] <ML74> *uniformjs
[08:56:40] <tw2113> $(this).find('option:selected').html()
[08:57:05] <DarkGhost`> I changed .live() to .on and now I'm getting b(...).on is not a function
[08:57:11] <ML74> tw2113: Was that for me?
[08:57:15] <tw2113> no
[08:57:16] <Gmac_> ill try that
[08:58:29] <tw2113> Gmac_, i'm not everywhere btw
[08:58:34] <tw2113> i'm not in #wordpress right now
[08:58:47] <Gmac_> hehe thanks it worked i don't know why i forgot about those pseudo classes...
[08:58:54] <Gmac_> well u should be
[08:58:59] <tw2113> no i shouldn't
[08:59:13] <tw2113> too much of a dayjob work distraction at times
[08:59:27] <doug65536> DarkGhost`: shouldn't you be using bind for that?
[08:59:35] <Gmac_> by the way i have been using fireboxes inspector its cool and all but the font size is tiny and i can't get it bigger with cmd plus
[08:59:41] <Gmac_> firefoxes
[09:00:22] <DarkGhost`> everywhere says to replace .live with .on doug65536
[09:00:53] <doug65536> DarkGhost`: can you show code? live and on are two completely different things
[09:01:04] <tw2113> Gmac_, if there's not a way to change that, i may just have introduced the idea to the devtools team
[09:01:13] <DarkGhost`> doug65536 its in a plugin and its really long but.. yeah
[09:01:32] <doug65536> DarkGhost`: do you have a url for the plugin?
[09:01:43] <doug65536> DarkGhost`: you can pull in plugins in jsfiddle
[09:01:49] <Gmac_> do these devs have amazing eyesight?
[09:01:56] <doug65536> Gmac_: yes
[09:01:56] <DarkGhost`> doug65536 http://privatepaste.com/c1b4c9b98a
[09:03:21] <doug65536> DarkGhost`: why are you doing that in jquery?
[09:03:43] <tw2113> Gmac_, mostly work in progress
[09:04:21] <doug65536> DarkGhost`: try this: b("."+G).bind("click", function(raw_a){ var a = raw_a.target; ...
[09:04:23] <DarkGhost`> idk its a plugin and its for a client i'm just trying ot make it owkr.
[09:04:43] <DarkGhost`> that worked doug65536 thank you
[09:04:48] <DarkGhost`> whats the difference between .live, .on and .bind?
[09:05:22] <doug65536> DarkGhost`: bind is meant for event bubbling
[09:05:31] <doug65536> live is old, not sure what that did
[09:05:54] <DarkGhost`> okay and what is .on? just like a longer vrsion of .click()
[09:05:55] <doug65536> live is deprecated I think
[09:05:55] <DarkGhost`> ?
[09:05:58] <DarkGhost`> yes live is
[09:06:08] <doug65536> on binds strictly to events that happen on that object I think
[09:06:59] <doug65536> DarkGhost`: afaik, .on won't catch bubbling events
[09:07:20] <DarkGhost`> ok thank you
[09:07:27] <doug65536> DarkGhost`: I should test my assumptions sometime though :)
[09:07:32] <Bloomberg> Guys, Someone has worked before with jTable jquery plugin?
[09:08:00] <doug65536> DarkGhost`: I've used bind when I want to bind to a parent of a bunch of stuff and it has always worked as expected. I don't know the exact semantic differences tbh
[09:08:42] <doug65536> DarkGhost`: you made me curious, going to test now :)
[09:09:10] <DarkGhost`> lol ok well thank you
[09:16:48] <daveAway> ive got a problem with a bit of my jquery
[09:17:08] <daveAway> http://pastebin.com/92KbGcjc
[09:17:37] <daveAway> i dont even know what it's doing so that was a pointless post
[09:18:09] <daveAway> it just seems to not work, it's supposed to insert an image after the end of a line of images
[09:18:52] <daveAway> it grabs the correct information for the image path but it seems to skip the data.load
[09:19:34] <doug65536> DarkGhost`: see if you can make any sense of this http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/SanF7/
[09:19:36] <doug65536> DarkGhost`: :)
[09:20:15] <cory_j_> Morning folks.
[09:22:48] <serapath> do jquery selectors follow the same rules as css selectors?
[09:23:43] <grafi> pretty much
[09:24:44] <serapath> if i have a div with id #a containing several div's, one with the class .b  and that class contains several buttons, one with the class .btn-primary, would $('#a > .b > .btn-primary') select it?
[09:25:37] <myosotis> yes, assuming that there is not a level of nesting you did not mention
[09:26:19] <doug65536> why doesn't this test detect any differences between on and bind? http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/SanF7/
[09:30:34] <dcherman> doug65536: because the form of `on` that you're using is functionally equivalent to bind.
[09:31:17] <doug65536> dcherman: I would need a second parameter that "filters out" specific events for .on to be different?
[09:31:45] <dcherman> doug65536: what do you mean 'filters out'?  do you mean you want to do event delegation?
[09:32:07] <doug65536> dcherman: I was under the impression that bind is for event bubbling, and on isn't
[09:32:12] <doug65536> apparently that was wrong
[09:33:06] <dcherman> doug65536: .bind is just shorthand for a specific variant of .on:  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event-alias.js#L19
[09:33:17] <Bloomberg> someone here has worked with jTable jquery plugin?
[09:33:48] <doug65536> dcherman: thanks! I'll take a close look at the .on overloads
[09:34:55] <doug65536> dcherman: ok, my guess was right, second parameter to .on can be a selector that identifies which event targets I want to get callbacks for, right?
[09:35:32] <dcherman> doug65536: correct, that's all documented here - http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:36:50] <doug65536> dcherman: thanks
[09:42:28] <cory_j_> I'm having trouble with string.replace with jquery -> http://jsfiddle.net/r7MgY/
[09:42:55] <doug65536> cory_j_: that must be the wrong link
[09:43:46] <cory_j_> wierd.
[09:44:22] <Bloomberg> cory_j:man do you have many knowledge about jquery?
[09:44:28] <doug65536> cory_j_: I've done that before, you probably didn't copy it
[09:44:41] <cory_j_> how about this one ->http://jsfiddle.net/r7MgY/20204/
[09:45:55] <doug65536> cory_j_: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/r7MgY/20206/
[09:46:45] <doug65536> cory_j_: it saves a reference to the element, gets the text from it, updates the text, then sets the text
[09:47:28] <Anny> hello... couдd someone help to me please with my mini problem with jquery  text of question you also can see there... http://jsfiddle.net/YyyHS/3/  thank you...
[09:47:38] <cory_j_> seems awfully wordy.
[09:47:50] <doug65536> cory_j_: read, modify, write
[09:47:56] <doug65536> cory_j_: what's wordy?
[09:48:49] <cory_j_> versus this type of thing: $(this).siblings().attr('blah')
[09:48:55] <cory_j_> cahins and chains of functions
[09:50:49] <Bloomberg> someone can help me with this  ::   http://jsbin.com/atuhin/1/
[09:50:49] <Bloomberg> plz
[09:54:43] <doug65536> cory_j_: ok, show me how to do it with less
[09:55:05] <doug65536> Anny: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/YyyHS/10/
[09:55:31] <cory_j_> don't get me wrong. I agree with you.
[09:56:04] <doug65536> cory_j_: since you don't have completely direct access to the string, you call through jquery to get set text, so it is slightly more code
[09:56:26] <cory_j_> that was the piece I was missing.
[09:56:39] <cory_j_> It "seems' direct
[09:56:52] <doug65536> cory_j_: you could go around jquery and just manipulate .innerHTML but I don't know if that would work in every browser
[09:57:13] <doug65536> cory_j_: and it would hardly make it any smaller
[09:57:47] <doug65536> cory_j_: and it would be much less safe - it wouldn't handle entities (&amp; &lt; etc)
[09:58:22] <doug65536> cory_j_: so then you could access innerText - also not sure about cross-browser problems there
[09:58:29] <zizzl> Hey guys I might be crazy, (learning jquery), but I am using WordPress and using a responsive dropdown nav menu ... It works great and is designed to show the 'current nav item' which also works great, but when the current page is not in that nav menu, it shows blank. Is there an IF statement I can write that shows 'Home' or 'Navigation' or it's parent item (if someone can put me in the right direction I can try figure it out)
[09:58:33] <zizzl> thanks so much, sorry to be so generic
[09:58:35] <cory_j_> cool, just wondered WHY my way didn't work and you anwered that well
[09:59:35] <alainus> can I ensure a function that's been binded to a certain event is executed last ? (after other bindings to the same event)
[09:59:40] <zizzl> ... something like "if the menu doesn't have an li with the class of "current-menu-item" show this...
[09:59:45] <doug65536> cory_j_: use val() when working with form fields
[09:59:47] <alainus> right now I'm setting a timer but it doesn't seem optimum
[10:00:33] <doug65536> zizzl: .addClass('my_class_name')
[10:00:50] <doug65536> zizzl: it's ok to add a class that is already there - it will be a no-op
[10:02:24] <doug65536> zizzl: I'll be about as specific as I can be from that. yes you can find the parent of an element with .parent()
[10:02:44] <zizzl> doug65536 ok thanks, can I just jump into an if statement or do I have to wrap in something
[10:02:53] <doug65536> zizzl: no idea what "it" is when you say "it shows blank"
[10:03:32] <Anny> I will be very happy if someone will help me please http://jsfiddle.net/YyyHS/3/
[10:03:47] <doug65536> Anny: I already gave you an answer
[10:04:10] <doug65536> Anny: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/YyyHS/10/
[10:04:13] <zizzl> doug65536 "it shows blank" - the dropdown menu is designed to show the current menu item as what shows for the menu when not dropped down.. when that page isn't in the menu, the menu shows nothing
[10:06:03] <doug65536> zizzl: you want a way to say "if (<that menu is empty>) { ... do something ...} in code?
[10:06:55] <zizzl> doug65536: if any of that menu's li's doesn't have class "current-menu-item" do something
[10:08:01] <doug65536> zizzl: if(the_menu_element.find('.current-menu-item'))
[10:08:13] <doug65536> where "the_menu_element" is the parent element of the menu items
[10:08:28] <zizzl> doug65536 right...
[10:08:34] <doug65536> to say, if none are there, put ! before it
[10:08:37] <zizzl> how do I say, if it doesn't have that
[10:08:45] <zizzl> before what?
[10:09:00] <doug65536> if(!the_menu_element.find('.current-menu-item'))
[10:09:03] <zizzl> !if() or if!()
[10:09:06] <zizzl> ok
[10:09:18] <zizzl> thanks let me try some things
[10:09:22] <doug65536> zizzl: wait though
[10:09:34] <doug65536> cleaner way might be: if(the_menu_element.find('.current-menu-item').length == 0)
[10:17:42] <devslash> i have a jquery page on page A which opens pop up window B which has a form. Once the user fills in the form, and clicks on submit, is there a way to manipulate an element on page A with the form results ?
[10:20:59] <defaultro> hey folks, has anyone tried this? http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/
[10:21:50] <devslash> is anyone here
[10:33:34] <Anny> doug65536: thanks for help.... but i see there in input values of  options which was selected... and i need something like:  if selected option1 from one select form and option2 from another select form result will be for example text "Hello"... if   selected option1 from one select form and option1 from another select form result will be : "Goodbye" and etc )))
[10:35:10] <doug65536> Anny: say hello if they are different and say goodbye if they are the same?
[10:37:14] <doug65536> Anny: you should be able to update the function to look at the values and set the input field appropriately. this is homework, right?
[10:37:31] <doug65536> you want me to give you the answer?
[10:38:30] <Anny> doug65536 for example select form1 and select form2 .... and from which  options from 2forms was selected depends result.... for exampel i know how to make it if there only one select form.. but when it 2 select forms i dotn know how to do it...
[10:38:52] <doug65536> look at my fiddle
[10:38:58] <doug65536> it accesses the value of each one
[10:39:02] <doug65536> look at the selector names
[10:39:36] <Anny> doug65536 ahaa.. thanks ... i will look again
[10:40:02] <doug65536> $('#choose1').val() returns the "value" of the first select
[10:40:10] <doug65536> $('#choose2').val() returns the "value" of the second one
[10:40:26] <doug65536> the "value" is from the html, value="1", for example
[10:41:06] <zizzl> doug65536, you're the man.. just wanted to tell you that.. you're one of the few left on IRC that are just out to help and not to bash the rookies
[10:41:31] <doug65536> zizzl: I don't try to make people feel bad about themselves :)
[10:41:38] <doug65536> unlike some devs :)
[10:43:11] <doug65536> zizzl: change that fiddle and save it, I'll help if you can't get it to work
[10:43:19] <doug65536> zizzl: post fiddle link back to me
[10:43:23] <doug65536> after saving
[10:44:21] <zizzl> doug65536 you've got the wrong guy
[10:44:24] <zizzl> I just chimed in
[10:44:29] <zizzl> because you've helped me twice of the past two days
[10:44:33] <doug65536> zizzl: oh sorry lol
[10:44:34] <doug65536> got ya
[10:45:08] <doug65536> Anny: ^^ see what I said to zizzl by mistake

[11:48:47] <hellgheast> Did have someone time to help a newbie in Jquery ?
[11:48:59] <alexr2> Just ask your question, someone will help if they can
[11:49:09] <hellgheast> Okey
[11:54:40] <hellgheAST> Here's my code
[11:54:42] <Al1> anyone familiar with jasny fileuplaod?
[11:54:47] <hellgheAST> http://shrib.com/sjByVZP5
[11:54:53] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/atuhin/1/
[11:55:02] <Bloomberg> Someone can help me with this?
[11:55:13] <hellgheAST> When i launch it it freeze my web browser
[11:56:08] <jedimind> then dont launch it?
[11:56:13] <sayd> best way to removed disabled attribute?
[11:56:21] <hellgheAST> My objective is when my programm have run 50 times it wait 12 seconds
[11:56:26] <jedimind> also why would you give me code that will freeze my browser, that's a shitty move
[11:56:38] <bob-98274> hellgheAST: The "while(true)" doesn't look like it exits...  ever...
[11:56:47] <jedimind> my ex girlfriend used to do that all the time
[11:56:53] <alexr2> sayd: selector.prop("disabled", false)
[11:56:55] <jedimind> "ew this fish tastes disgusting, here try it"
[11:57:21] <hellgheAST> It's a bruteforce script for a game
[11:57:45] <hellgheAST> For the moment i don't know how to check if the formular is gone or not.
[12:01:03] <hellgheAST> @BOB-98274  Can i with jquery check if a formular comes again or not ?
[12:02:02] <prilax__> you 've got to give a lot more details when you ask a question like that
[12:02:27] <jedimind> also why are you asking bob?
[12:02:29] <bob-98274> hellgheAST: not sure what you're getting at.  You might try doing a "break;" after that setTimeout.  Then the loop will at least exit.
[12:03:32] <bob-98274> then teste() will get called after 12 seconds.  But you will need to do something in teste() besides just setting cnt to get anything else to run.
[12:04:07] <alexr2> Anyone know a good jquery plugin to enable <style scoped> functionality?
[12:04:26] <hellgheAST> Okey i'll give the details
[12:04:52] <hellgheAST> Has you see i give a number in an input
[12:05:09] <hellgheAST> For this inpur i'm trying to find the right number
[12:05:41] <hellgheAST> why after 50 times i wait 12 seconds ? Because i must have time to fill the captcha that is enabled
[12:06:22] <hellgheAST> after that the formular comes again and normally my script must continue to do his work
[12:07:07] <hellgheAST> But now when i lauch the script it fills and send the data but frezze my web browser
[12:07:33] <hellgheAST> Any other question ?
[12:07:35] <Evan_Donovan> nevermind on my question. i just set data-ajax="false" on the links in question. not ideal, but better than nothing.
[12:09:45] <bob-98274> hellgheAST: again, your code is probably sitting in the while loop forever adding a zillion timeout events or something.  I would start by changing the if to "while (cnt<050)" getting rid of the if/else, and move the settimeout out of the loop.
[12:09:53] <bob-98274> (or put the break; in like I suggested).
[12:10:50] <hellgheAST> OKey
[12:11:30] <hellgheAST> Can i do a button or a switch on the webpage to reset cnt ?
[12:11:45] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/atuhin/1/edit
[12:11:50] <Bloomberg> Someone can help me with this?

[12:12:19] <Al1> anyone familiar with jasny fileupload?
[12:12:28] <default> I'm facing a wall right now in Select2 plugin. Once I add query:, the data is lost. Data is populated by keywords() function. I would like to know how I would access the data inside the query:. I added data = keywords() but it was failing. Here is the code, http://pastebin.com/SHmrwgkb
[12:13:16] <cameron262> what would be the  best way to have a draggable textarea?
[12:14:46] <hellgheAST> @bob-98274 I'm a C developper ^^ did it exist in JS or in JQuery a goto instruction ? with that i can wait without stress and relaunch it.
[12:14:47] <b-ot> hellgheast: Sorry, I can't find anything on developper+^^+did+it+exist+in+JS+or+in+JQuery+a+goto+instruction+?+with+that+i+can+wait+without+stress+and+relaunch+it.
[12:17:06] <hellgheAST> bob-98274 I opened a discussion
[12:17:28] <bob-98274> hellgheAST: no goto.  Just set up an "click" event on a button and put your code there.
[12:17:56] <hellgheAST> okey.
[12:18:03] <hellgheAST> how to set up a button ?
[12:18:11] <hellgheAST> (sorry i'm a noob)
[12:26:10] <Al1> anyone know what this error is "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'parseMetaData' of undefined"
[12:26:32] <doug65536> Al1: whatever is on the left side of the . is undefined
[12:27:09] <doug65536> Al1: there are a few likely causes
[12:27:35] <doug65536> Al1: you forgot to include a script. you are trying to access the DOM before the document is ready, a typo
[12:28:13] <Al1> @doug65536 i found this fiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/GR2Lt/ pasted that code into my app - i got jquery loading before bootstrap files
[12:29:45] <doug65536> Al1: ok, the fiddle works for me
[12:30:14] <Al1> ok, i'll keep on digging around
[12:30:54] <doug65536> Al1: does fiddle work for you?
[12:31:09] <Al1> yeah, the fiddle works
[12:31:31] <doug65536> Al1: can you show your code? I might see why that happens
[12:34:54] <Al1> let me see if i can set up some sort of a fiddle
[12:37:10] <Bloomberg> Al1: you know jquery very good?
[12:44:24] <Al1> @Bloomberg - jquery somewhat good, still learning a lot about it
[12:47:58] <kazi> Hi guys! I need some jquery suggested learning materials to get an overview of jquery and to be up and running with it :)
[12:49:52] <kazi> Any suggestion please?
[12:50:16] <duch_kazatel> kazi the jquery site is a great place to start.
[12:50:57] <kazi> duch_kazatel: Thanks for your kind reply. I know but I need short course on it.
[12:51:45] <Al1> this is a good course for jQuery: http://try.jquery.com/
[12:51:48] <kazi> I prefer "learn by example" method
[12:52:45] <duch_kazatel> yeah, try.jquery should help you there.
[12:52:48] <kazi> thank you
[12:53:04] <kazi> thanks to both of you
[12:53:11] <duch_kazatel> np.
[12:55:31] <kazi> Any version suggestion for starting jquery? I'm not sure which version will be better for me.
[12:56:52] <duch_kazatel> any of the recent ones.
[12:57:18] <kazi> prefixed with 1 or 2?
[12:57:20] <duch_kazatel> probably the most recent.
[12:57:29] <duch_kazatel> either/or.  i'd go with 2 maybe?
[12:57:43] <kazi> alright :)
[12:58:19] <duch_kazatel> the core basics are effectively the same between the two for a beginner.

[13:52:37] <RavinduL> I have a jquery question. Can anyone answer it?
[13:52:44] <RavinduL> I have a jquery question. Can anyone answer it?
[13:52:52] <shoky> `ask @ ravenzz
[13:52:52] <b-ot> ravenzz: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:52:58] <grafi> Not if you dont ask it first oô
[13:52:59] <shoky> oops sry ravenzz
[13:53:06] <grafi> damn you shoky
[13:53:07] <grafi> !
[13:53:17] <shoky> no u
[13:53:20] <istvan> shoky: unfortunately the function I am writing doesn't necessarily go inside a console.log - thats why I wanted it to be generic
[13:53:22] <grafi> no u
[13:54:03] <shoky> istvan: generally, if you want something to happen after the ajax completes, you need to put it in an ajax callback function
[13:55:05] <istvan> shoky: so more generally - if I have a function that calls the .post method, how can I force it to not continue until the callback completes?
[13:55:17] <shoky> istvan: you don't
[13:55:32] <shoky> istvan: you force something not to happen before, by putting it in the callback
[13:55:32] <RavinduL> I want to create a text box which searches for a class inside a div. The class name will be the text in the Textbox. How can I make this with javascript?
[13:55:35] <garbagecollectio> var term = 'sammy'; x  = new RegExp('/^' + term + '/');
[13:55:36] <garbagecollectio> "sammy".match(x)
[13:55:38] <garbagecollectio> why doesn't that work?
[13:55:39] <RavinduL> I want to create a text box which searches for a class inside a div. The class name will be the text in the Textbox. How can I make this with javascript?
[13:56:04] <RavinduL> I want to create a text box which searches for a class inside a div. The class name will be the text in the Textbox. How can I make this with javascript?
[13:56:34] <istvan> shoky: is there no possible way?
[13:56:47] <shoky> istvan: but you can use the promise api to make it easier. e.g.  var req = $.post(...);   req.done(function(data) { ... do shit ... });   req.done(function(data) { ... do more shit ... });
[13:56:53] <grafi> please dont spam RavinduL
[13:57:07] <grafi> instead show us what you already have
[13:57:15] <grafi> pastebin? jsfiddle maybe?
[13:57:27] <RavinduL> okay. hold on...
[13:57:54] <profitbaron> I have a jquery question if anyone can help? :) - http://www.profitbaron.com/length.php do you see the text area? I want to write info in there and it post it as the results inside the existing div/spans so I can calculate length? Does anyone know a good way to do it?
[14:00:47] <profitbaron> or have i gone about it wrong?
[14:00:48] <duch_kazatel> profitbaron - bind to the "submit" event, prevent the form from submitting, and then parse out the content of it and do your fun.
[14:01:24] <profitbaron> how do i parse it into the div/span though? its where im stuck
[14:01:47] <profitbaron> as in is there something similar I could look at to use e.g. Handlebars or something?
[14:02:50] <duch_kazatel> well, if you just want to take that content, just get the value of that text area and write in the HTML
[14:03:18] <duch_kazatel> wrap the text in the nodes, etc.
[14:03:27] <profitbaron> i want to avoid keep writing it in HTML which is the idea of the textarea
[14:03:31] <profitbaron> so i can just paste themin
[14:03:34] <profitbaron> *them in
[14:03:44] <duch_kazatel> you use the javascript to write it in.
[14:04:20] <profitbaron> but they don't extract inside those div's/span's which i need to do the calculation?
[14:04:35] <duch_kazatel> ... are you just appending to those containers?
[14:04:41] <duch_kazatel> or replacing what's in them?
[14:05:11] <profitbaron> the ones which are there now are just examples
[14:05:18] <profitbaron> to see if it worked
[14:05:34] <duch_kazatel> so you want to add after those?
[14:06:48] <duch_kazatel> (where am i inserting this new content on the page?
[14:06:54] <profitbaron> so i want to extract each one on a line to be inside <div class="length"> <span>whatever was on each line</span> </div>
[14:07:30] <duch_kazatel> okay one sec.
[14:07:36] <profitbaron> in the text area it will have like blah / blah / blah (/ = new line) and then it will extract them as <div class="length"> <span>blah</span> </div><div class="length"> <span>blah</span> </div><div class="length"> <span>blah</span> </div> etc
[14:08:35] <duch_kazatel> right one sec.
[14:09:06] <duch_kazatel> okay so this is not meant as anything serious, more as a proof of concept, but the basic iteration is this: myText = $('textarea').val(); newNode = '<div class="length"><span>' + myText + '</span></div>';
[14:09:24] <duch_kazatel> (are you at all familiar with javascript or no?)
[14:10:13] <devslash> i do this in my code: var sorted=window.opener.$('#myElement')  // reference to element in parent window sorted=sorted.sort_select_box(); // sort_select_box code is at http://pastebin.com/TMbjkn5g I get an error that sort_select_box function doesnt exist. would it have to exit in the child or parent jquery page ?
[14:10:59] <devslash> err exist
[14:11:04] <profitbaron> duch_kazatel: but would that still consider the new line break?!
[14:11:14] <duch_kazatel> profitbaron - answer my question ;)
[14:11:41] <duch_kazatel> profitbaron - I can explain how to do it, but i really don't have the time or inclination two actually code something up for you.
[14:11:56] <RavinduL> http://jsfiddle.net/Pn5R7/
[14:11:58] <RavinduL> I have explained what needs to happen as a comment in the JavaScript section.
[14:12:02] <RavinduL> Please help me out.
[14:12:08] <profitbaron> duch_kazatel: i don't want you to code it... i just want a few pointers
[14:12:39] <duch_kazatel> profitbaron - take the val() of the inputarea and split on linebreaks, then iterate over those.
[14:16:07] <Anny> I will be happy if someone will help to me with my mini problem http://jsfiddle.net/LpPzr/
[14:16:10] <profitbaron> duch_kazatel: thanks!
[14:18:45] <gcpeters_> @Ravindul http://jsfiddle.net/Pn5R7/
[14:29:47] <profitbaron> duch_kazatel: i realised i could do it quicker in PHP thanks anyway
[14:30:02] <profitbaron> as in read the textarea and then do an $output etc
[14:32:05] <duch_kazatel> profitbaron - lol okay...
[14:32:13] <duch_kazatel> still would be interested to see your source.
[14:32:18] <duch_kazatel> about where you hear that width thing.
[14:32:41] <profitbaron> when I was at Google's office and the fact that I do SEO for a living... they started truncating
[14:32:51] <profitbaron> on certain stuff its all over Moz.com etc as well
[14:33:34] <grafi> seo for a living, that sounds interesting
[14:33:45] <profitbaron> its not
[14:33:54] <profitbaron> lol
[14:34:10] <grafi> why do you do it then
[14:34:12] <grafi> :P
[14:34:37] <duch_kazatel> http://www.seomofo.com/experiments/google-serp-max-characters.html
[14:34:37] <duch_kazatel> ah SERPs
[14:34:55] <profitbaron> yeah
[14:34:59] <profitbaron> grafi: easy money
[14:35:37] <profitbaron> duch_kazatel: which is why im making a bulk tester so i can do 50 at a time or something saves keep doing 1 at a time & checking
[14:35:52] <profitbaron> but i keep messing it up haha
[14:36:08] <duch_kazatel> no that makes sense.  you'd talked about meta titles and I was like "wat"
[14:36:49] <profitbaron> ive got it working in PHP now, i just need to move the text area outside the php to do it
[14:37:38] <Anny> i will be very glad if someone will help to me with my mini problem http://jsfiddle.net/LpPzr/
[14:38:33] <Anny> i need to solve it until tomorrow morning  (european time) but i dont know how
[14:39:09] <grafi> im not even sure what you are doing
[14:40:34] <duch_kazatel> no that makes sense.  you'd talked about meta titles and I was like "wat"
[14:40:40] <duch_kazatel> woops
[14:42:03] <grafi> one more time duch_kazatel
[14:42:03] <grafi> ^^
[14:42:23] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[14:44:40] <grafi> [23:40:30] <duch_kazatel> no that makes sense.  you'd talked about meta titles and I was like "wat"
[14:45:48] <duch_kazatel> oh hah yeah.
[14:46:06] <duch_kazatel> thought i was in another window and hit "up" to issue my last command to my bot.
[15:01:33] <tds5016> hi all. I'm having a hard time getting jquery to set the css position to relative.
[15:01:39] <tds5016> does anyone know how I'd do such a thing?
[15:02:25] <tds5016> for some reason it alway seems to get set to absolute
[15:03:08] <duch_kazatel> $('#test').css("position", "relative")
[15:03:19] <duch_kazatel> note that CSS might be coming in and changing that after you set it.
[15:03:29] <henn1nk> how can i react on input field inputs? someone is typing something and i would like to create a live search result..
[15:03:54] <henn1nk> keyup doesn't work?
[15:04:41] <tds5016> duch_kazatel: so I think I'm doing that.
[15:05:08] <tds5016> what else would potentially change the positioning setting?
[15:05:13] <duch_kazatel> CSS...
[15:08:51] <tds5016> oh, son of a gun...
[15:08:57] <tds5016> I figured out what's setting it to absolute....
[15:09:24] <tds5016> for some reason var item = this.append('<li></li>');
[15:09:34] <tds5016> it is the list that is this.
[15:10:03] <tds5016> yeah, that made my head explode too... I mean that this.append returns the ul that li was appended to, not the li that was created.
[15:29:00] <awc737> If I have: <a><span>not what I want</span>what I want</a>
[15:29:12] <awc737> how can I get $(a).text() to only = "what I want"
[15:32:12] <duch_kazatel> awc737 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6138989/how-to-get-the-text-of-parent-element-using-jquery
[15:32:14] <duch_kazatel> does that help

[15:39:25] <awc737> thanks duch_kazatel that's exactly what I need
[15:39:36] <raj> Cork, so sorry to ask this again, but you've linked me to a great website that shows how to write a jquery plugin. It builds from a simple function to making it more and more advanced. Could you please tell me that site again? THANKS!
[15:39:55] <raj> *you've linked me multiple times in the past
[15:41:07] <cameron262> i have a div over a textarea which when double clicked it goes to display:none, but how can i make it so that the textcursor will be placed where i have double clicked?
[15:46:09] <cameron262> what would be the best way to make a draggable textarea which you can edit on a double click?
[15:47:50] <shoky> raj: you mean the old one from jquery's site?
[15:48:27] <shoky> raj: if so, http://web.archive.org/web/20130502100718/http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[15:50:31] <raj> shoky, yes!
[15:50:34] <raj> thanks!
[15:50:41] <tw2113> raj, bookmark it
[15:50:42] <raj> it's been taken down?
[15:50:45] <tw2113> evernote it
[15:50:47] <tw2113> screenshot it
[15:50:51] <tw2113> turn it into a pdf
[15:50:52] <sayd> i'd like a form validation plugin that is realtime. ie, doesnt rely on blur as the jquery.validate does. any suggestions?
[15:50:55] <tw2113> and get it tattooed on your arm
[15:51:21] <raj> sayd, keyup?
[15:51:34] <raj> with timeout
[15:51:35] <tw2113> also hit view source and copy/paste what you see there, save it to localhost
[15:51:44] <raj> i mean delay
[15:51:59] <raj> why has it been removed?
[15:52:07] <raj> is something better on the site now?
[15:52:18] <sayd> raj: hmm i thought jqueryvalidate did that by default too but it doesnt seem to
[15:53:16] <shoky> raj: imo, no
[15:53:41] <tw2113> maybe they just wanted to remove the content
[15:53:42] <shoky> tho i didn't check for updates in a while
[15:53:46] <tw2113> people do crazy things like that
[15:53:59] <raj> sayd, it's an option, as per http://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation/
[15:54:55] <raj> shoky, so you keep that web.archive.org link bookmarked?
[15:55:21] <shoky> raj yep. mostly so i can link people to it here ;P
[15:57:17] <raj> haha
[15:57:23] <raj> gotcha
[15:58:03] <raj> saved
[15:59:00] <tw2113> don't forget the tattoo idea raj
[16:00:05] <cameron262> how can i fake a click so that a textarea will be selected where the cursor is>
[16:00:24] <cameron262> i mean the textcursor needs to be where the mouse has clicked, like if it was really clicked
[16:00:45] <raj> tw2113, good idea
[16:01:29] <tw2113> you'll have to find a way to fill in the space behind it too cameron262
[16:01:39] <cameron262> what tw2113?
[16:02:20] <tw2113> by default with an empty textarea
[16:02:31] <tw2113> when you click into it, the cursor goes to the upper left corner, right?
[16:02:37] <cameron262> yes
[16:02:49] <cameron262> the textarea wont be empty
[16:03:03] <tw2113> if you wanted to have it automatically click into the middle of the textarea, you need to give enough characters to keep it there
[16:03:12] <tw2113> so it'd already have text in it?
[16:03:16] <cameron262> yes
[16:03:45] <tw2113> isn't it already default behavior to have your cursor go to where you click in a textarea with text already in it?
[16:04:14] <cameron262> it's a div with text in which is draggable, but when you double click it turns into a textarea
[16:04:29] <tw2113> ah, so it's a div with text
[16:04:31] <cameron262> but i want it to focus automatically, and have the textcursor in the position wheree the user clicked
[16:04:33] <tw2113> not a textarea with text
[16:04:42] <cameron262> no it is a textarea
[16:04:47] <tw2113> no, it's a div
[16:04:48] <tw2113> you just said
[16:04:50] <cameron262> after it has been clicked
[16:04:54] <cameron262> no
[16:04:55] <tw2113> yes, after it's been clicked
[16:04:57] <cameron262> yes
[16:04:58] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle plz
[16:05:03] <tw2113> it starts out a div, it turns into a textarea
[16:05:06] <cameron262> yes
[16:05:21] <tw2113> so the div holds the actual text, and you move that text in dynamically
[16:05:41] <cameron262> yes
[16:06:25] <tw2113> i'm curious if it's possible to grab the position and/or characters to the left of the cursor
[16:06:37] <tw2113> well, count of characters
[16:06:47] <tw2113> and then use tht to move the cursor that far in
[16:06:57] <tw2113> just throwing spaghetti at the wall here
[16:07:12] * shoky licks it off
[16:07:26] <tw2113> there's no sauce yet shoky
[16:07:36] <duch_kazatel> is there a fiddle for this?
[16:07:43] <shoky> im sauce enough. do u like my thong
[16:08:17] <duch_kazatel> woah.
[16:08:18] <duch_kazatel> wtf
[16:08:18] <ernston> hi, has anyone used google maps with jquery mobile ?
[16:08:39] <tw2113> don't mind shoky and i duch_kazatel
[16:08:43] <tw2113> we're off like that
[16:08:52] <shoky> you can mind us a bit
[16:09:21] <duch_kazatel> no it's cool i just look over anmd see stuff about thons.
[16:09:25] <duch_kazatel> *thongs
[16:09:29] <duch_kazatel> tossed me for a loop.
[16:09:31] <shoky> see, all good
[16:10:22] <tw2113> hopefully it's not an infinite loop
[16:11:04] <cameron262> tw2113, any idea how i'd do it? i dont think that way would be possible because characters are obviously variable sizes
[16:11:18] <tw2113> nope
[16:11:27] <tw2113> i'm not talking the size
[16:11:31] <tw2113> i'm talking how many there are
[16:11:39] <tw2113> "here" has 4
[16:11:56] <tw2113> Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious has 34
[16:12:09] <cameron262> yes but how would i work out where the cursor was?
[16:12:32] <tw2113> that's the tricky party
[16:12:32] <tw2113> and why i mentioned spaghetti at the wall
[16:12:37] <tw2113> giving you general logic ideas to look up
[16:12:43] <cameron262> no
[16:12:46] <tw2113> but shoky ate all the spaghetti
[16:13:03] <tw2113> no what?
[16:13:14] <cameron262> no
[16:13:22] <tw2113> keep going
[16:13:24] <cameron262> no
[16:13:42] <tw2113> you want me to hand you a code snippet that does everything for you perfectly?
[16:13:50] <cameron262> no
[16:13:50] <duch_kazatel> :(
[16:14:03] <tw2113> are you only able to say "no" ?
[16:14:13] <cameron262> yes
[16:14:20] <tw2113> liar!
[16:14:22] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaaaaa
[16:14:24] <cameron262> no
[16:14:56] <tw2113> are you straight?
[16:15:05] <cameron262> no
[16:15:06] <tw2113> (not that it's bad either way, folks)
[16:19:44] <beancurd> aye.

[18:37:21] <Zak_> can you use jquery ui with jquery 2.0?
[18:38:23] <BillCriswell> If you don't mind the lack it IE8- support probably Zak.
[18:39:39] <Zak> yeah, i understand that jquery 2.0 dropped support for IE8 and backwards. Just wondering if its acceptable to use it against jquery ui. It seems that when you download a build of jquery ui, it gives you jquery 1.9
[18:39:53] <Zak> sort of hints that you probably shouldn't use jquery 2.0
[18:40:14] <tw2113> or they're just doing it for the "greatest amount of browser support"
[18:40:41] <tw2113> and assuming most will want/need IE8 and down support
[18:40:58] <BillCriswell> Zak: I agree with tw2113.
[18:42:42] <Zak> tw2113: sure. It would just be nice to know if its supported or not. I'm worried jqueryui relies on some functionality that's been made obsolete in jquery 2
[18:43:11] <Zak> i tried looking on jquery-ui site but i didn't find anything. (I should probably look harder)
[18:44:13] <Zak> i'm not sure if jquery 1.6+ includes jquery 2.0 either
[18:44:32] <BillCriswell> Zak: jQuery 2.x is the same as jQuery 1.x but without support for IE 6, 7 and 8 from what I gather.
[18:44:56] <BillCriswell> Zak: http://jquery.com/download/
[18:45:41] <Zak> hmm, i guess the "same API" means it should support it
[18:45:58] <Zak> i'm just surprised its not mentioned anywhere at all on jquery-ui
[18:46:07] <Zak> ok thanks guys. I'll experiment
[18:46:13] <BillCriswell> Same shovel... just picks up different shit.
[18:46:19] <BillCriswell> Is that how that phrase works?
[18:52:39] <Weezey> Oh, I'm already on that channel.
[18:53:09] <Weezey> anyone know typeahead.js reasonably well?
[18:53:58] <Weezey> I've got it mostly working except it only ever shows me the first match.
[18:54:28] <BillCriswell> Weezey: Live anywhere?
[18:54:44] <grafi> On his computer BillCriswell
[18:55:00] <BillCriswell> dot dot dot public.
[18:55:25] <grafi> could be public
[18:55:25] <BillCriswell> grafi: When you're right you're right.
[18:55:27] <Weezey> Only have real data, can't share it. :/
[18:55:50] <grafi> when im right, im mostly wrong BillCriswell
[18:56:11] <BillCriswell> are you doing anything weird like... .slice(1)? Very hard to say without seeing the code.
[18:56:22] <BillCriswell> grafi: Haha.
[18:56:50] <grafi> must be possible to strip data from the actual code, no?
[18:57:00] <grafi> hm
[18:57:00] <Weezey> Only weird thing I'm doing over the examples I've seen is returning different fields, userID, username, first, last, email
[18:57:06] <grafi> "You autocomplete me"
[18:57:13] <Weezey> it shows me the first one in the json
[18:57:15] <grafi> that'll make for a nice tshirt
[18:57:19] <BillCriswell> grafi: so romantic.
[18:57:22] <Weezey> which makes me thing my json is wrong.
[18:57:32] <Weezey> s/ng/nk/
[18:58:03] <{{Guy|sleeps}}> I've never really liked Jason much..
[18:58:05] <Weezey> but I can't find any samples of working json with multiple fields for typeahead.js
[18:58:13] <grafi> hm
[18:58:15] <BillCriswell> Weezey: what if you console.log( results ) before they're output?
[18:58:28] <Weezey> ooh, that sounds fun, I'll do that.
[18:58:43] <grafi> i would really like to see the structure of that json ^^
[18:58:48] <Weezey> I'm veteran JS, new the jS
[18:58:55] <Weezey> err jQ

[19:03:08] <Weezey> It's almost 3 and I'm still happy with it, with an SSD I'll still put it to good use too
[19:03:26] <Weezey> grafi: they don't have retina
[19:03:29] <BillCriswell> SSD is my favorite thing ever.

[19:04:20] <BillCriswell> My girlfriend has the Macbook Pro retina, the size is perfect.
[19:04:21] <grafi> yeah, my roomie has an ultrabook with ssd, its the shit
[19:04:50] <BillCriswell> It's a great weight as well.

[22:26:34] <Goopyo> does nth-last-child not work with a context? e.g $('td:nth-last-child(2)', this)
[22:26:39] <Goopyo> is giving me a syntax error for some reason
[22:43:16] <obert> gee i cannot get this working.
[22:45:58] <obert> someone is free to try to help me?
[22:47:05] <grafi> sure
[22:57:44] <Weezey> IRC really does work.
[22:58:28] <grafi> xD
[22:58:37] <obert> ok
[22:58:41] <grafi> I can read what you type Weezey
[22:58:43] <grafi> its crazy
[22:58:59] <Weezey> totally
[22:59:13] <Weezey> Bill suggested that console output thing
[22:59:33] <Weezey> kinda helped but led me into fixing my problem in under 5 mintes
[22:59:37] <Weezey> minutes
[22:59:44] <Weezey> been working on it on and off for two days.
[23:00:16] <grafi> xD
[23:00:28] <grafi> 2nd set of eyes is always helpful
[23:00:44] <grafi> especially when you have been staring at a problem for too long
[23:01:01] <Weezey> without an object named value: in your JSON or changing valueKey to one of the values in your JSON, typeahead.js only returns one match
[23:01:13] <Weezey> and doesn't really work.
[23:01:38] <obert> i get this http://ramacciotti.altervista.org/gallery/ and i would to open in #real-img its image
[23:02:00] <Weezey> so it looks like it's just not working when in reality it's just failing to find a value to use.
[23:05:24] <Weezey> obert: maybe something like $("#real-img").html('<img src="' + big_img + '">');
[23:06:14] <obert> Weezey: on which line?
[23:06:50] <grafi> obert why dont you get some lightbox plugin?
[23:06:56] <grafi> plug and play and such
[23:07:19] <obert> grafi: i wont a lightbox, i would just learn/play with some .ajax :p
[23:07:25] <grafi> kk
[23:07:33] <obert> load the .jpg to a #div
[23:07:34] <grafi> good on you
[23:07:54] <obert> is that bad?
[23:08:00] <Weezey> obert: no
[23:09:00] <Weezey> obert: put it on line 10 and see what happens
[23:10:53] <le_gars> Hi. I have a question clearing the values of a form that using jquery validate. Any one now how?
[23:12:30] <le_gars> The thing is that Im working with an instance of an object that holds the form. I have have a click event connected to like a info box which holds the form. So you can close the info box by clicking a button marked "x".
[23:13:00] <obert> Weezey: something happens
[23:13:18] <le_gars> So if I got errors in my form and I close the info box I also want to clear out the form.
[23:13:29] <le_gars> Nothing seems to work
[23:13:54] <le_gars> Ive tried clearForm, clear, val('')
[23:13:56] <le_gars> etc
[23:15:52] <obert> Weezey: it try to load it there, then it is redirected to the static .jpg file
[23:17:43] <Weezey> le_gars: .reset() the form ?
[23:18:25] <Weezey> obert: dunno mate, I'd comment everything after that point out if you want it to appear in the page.
[23:19:30] <Weezey> crap! It's 2am and I a meeting in the morning.
[23:19:44] * Weezey nods off.
[23:19:58] <le_gars> Weezey: Yes thats what I have tried. It just says: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<ObjectName> has no method 'reset'
[23:25:58] <CapMax> hey guys
[23:26:02] <duckgoose> hello
[23:26:08] <CapMax> is there any reason selector.html() has suddenly stopped working on my site?
[23:26:22] <CapMax> console says TypeErrror jQuery(....).html() is not defined
[23:26:24] <CapMax> and its always worked
[23:29:29] <Aristata> How do I do something like this: $('input[type=checkbox]:checked)') ? That is invalid the way it is, even though this: $('input[type=checkbox]:not(:'checked')') is not
[23:30:56] <Cork> Aristata: $('input[type="checkbox"]:checked') or $(':checkbox:checked)') ?
[23:32:24] <Aristata> Yup that was it, just found it in the docs! Thanks!
[23:51:47] <obert> Weezey: no way
