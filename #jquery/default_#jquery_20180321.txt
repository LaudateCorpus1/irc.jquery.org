[00:00:55] <skypce> I want the image div inside of the group-left. Thank you :P
[00:02:55] <pavonia> Well, the selector doesn't match your HTML code
[00:05:42] <pavonia> And .group-left isn't even a parent of .image-header :S
[00:07:22] <skypce> mmm
[00:07:26] <skypce> Now I was fixed it
[00:07:28] <skypce> http://jsfiddle.net/25ah8cLg/6/
[00:07:31] <skypce> sorry
[00:07:37] <skypce> i modify the selector
[00:07:50] <skypce> I modified the selector I want say
[00:09:21] <skypce> pavonia, yes but If I use parents(".group-left") jQuery will descending in the dom
[00:09:52] <skypce> To the .group.left
[00:10:04] <skypce> I dont know why it did not work :S
[00:10:40] <pavonia> No, it goes up in the DOM
[00:12:19] <pavonia> Perhaps you want .siblings()
[00:13:07] <pavonia> and append() instead of appendTo()
[00:14:06] <skypce> Thank you pavonia I will try
[00:18:25] <skypce> Now it is working

[07:55:30] <tilerendering> hola
[08:36:48] <tilerendering> hm why does i18next omit my nested links with captions + elements inside span?
[08:37:10] <Woet> tilerendering: what is your jQuery question?
[08:53:00] <vish93> Hi guys I am looking to use https://github.com/eisbehr-/jquery.lazy on a site, is this the ‘best’ lazyload plugin ?
[11:01:49] <Koopz> yo o/
[11:02:02] <Koopz> anybody experienced with jquery.inputmask?
[11:02:54] <bomb> not me
[11:04:55] <Koopz> i've got the following mask: "[A]{1,3} [A]{1,2} [9]{1,4} [A]{0,1}" and for some reason it submits placeholders on the number part, e.g. "AA AA 123" will be "AA AA 123_", "AA AA 12" = "AA AA 12__"
[11:06:32] <Koopz> however i can input "AA AA 123 " (note the space at end) and it will end up as "AA AA 123"
[11:09:52] <reynierpm> hello there
[11:10:00] <reynierpm> can I get some ideas with this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49408868/how-to-swap-buttons-when-action-is-taken-and-response-is-success ??
[11:11:17] <Koopz> heh i think i just fixed it by making the space at the very last "group" optional
[12:00:32] <reynierpm> ok, I have change things a little bit, could any take a look and give me some ideas: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49408868/how-to-refresh-re-render-button-when-text-change-while-using-fontawesome ??
[12:29:52] <Uhkis> reynierpm: html() instead of text()
[13:16:59] <reynierpm> Uhkis, thanks I saw someone answer there, maybe you ;)
[13:41:59] <mark721> hi guys
[13:42:27] <mark721> um im having some issues with accordions and doing expand all and collapse, now while i found an easy way to do it there is a tiny issue
[13:42:46] <mark721> so firstly the easy way is me just doing $('h4 a').click()
[13:43:44] <mark721> and that expands everything, only difference is that i want the button to change from Expand All to Collapse all On click. NOTE unlike normal accordions you can have 1 or more (or ALL) accordions open at the same time
[13:44:15] <robertmaxrees> which accordion lib are you using?
[13:44:42] <mark721> i think bootstrap lol one sec
[13:45:18] <robertmaxrees> and also: what's the actual problem you're having? :)
[13:45:46] <mark721> i dont know how to get the button to change
[13:45:47] <mark721> like
[13:45:50] <mark721> ok let me explain
[13:45:53] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:45:54] <mark721> the button changes from expand all to
[13:45:54] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[13:46:02] <mark721> change text*
[13:46:13] <robertmaxrees> does it happen when you actually physically click it?
[13:46:16] <mark721> yeah
[13:46:24] <mark721> it expands all and collapses all thats fine.
[13:46:28] <robertmaxrees> so you don't wanna use .click() - in general, you want to avoid that.
[13:46:35] <robertmaxrees> (to fire handlers, i mean)
[13:46:41] <robertmaxrees> which version of bootstrap are you using?
[13:46:54] <mark721> 3.3.7
[13:47:28] <mark721> could we see problem one then deal with correct way of doing it pls?
[13:47:39] <robertmaxrees> https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/javascript/#collapse-methods - you want to fire .collapse('show') on those, instead.
[13:47:41] <mark721> i mean its working, id rather fix this problem first then see the next
[13:47:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:47:58] <robertmaxrees> right, the issue is the way you're trying to open them is causing you problems.
[13:48:23] <mark721> oh
[13:48:54] <robertmaxrees> hence why i mention it.
[13:49:45] <mark721> .collapse('show isn't working')
[13:49:51] <mark721> .collapse('show') isn't working'
[13:49:54] <robertmaxrees> you gotta target the accordion itself.
[13:49:57] <robertmaxrees> not the h4 a
[13:50:01] <mark721> OH
[13:50:03] <mark721> :)_
[13:50:04] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:50:36] <robertmaxrees> $('#myCollapsible').collapse('show')
[13:50:41] <robertmaxrees> #boom
[13:52:19] <mark721> that hides the whole thing
[13:52:27] <mark721> like it disappears off scree
[13:52:31] <mark721> n
[13:52:37] <mark721> for me at least anyway.
[13:52:49] <robertmaxrees> gotta fiddle?
[13:52:50] <mark721> it was as if i called .hide()
[13:53:28] <mark721> could we just assume something for a bit
[13:53:32] <mark721> lol
[13:53:38] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:53:39] <mark721> assume .click() is fine for now
[13:53:45] <mark721> let me explain my issue
[13:54:13] <mark721> I want to check that all elements are not collapsed
[13:54:15] <mark721> using
[13:54:16] <mark721> $("h4 a").each(function(element) { $(element).hasClass('collpased'); });
[13:54:36] <mark721> but this isn't returning what i think it should
[13:54:45] <robertmaxrees> that's because .each() returns a jquery object.
[13:54:55] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to test if any of them don't have that class?
[13:55:02] <mark721> YES
[13:55:09] <robertmaxrees> .filter().length
[13:55:23] <mark721> filter('collapsed')?
[13:55:26] <mark721> filter('collapsed').length?
[13:55:39] <robertmaxrees> the .filter() will reduce the set down to elements that match your selector.
[13:55:55] <robertmaxrees> and then .length will tell you how many matched.
[13:56:02] <robertmaxrees> you can also pass a function to .filter()
[13:57:36] <mark721> $("h4 a").filter('collapsed').length;
[13:57:37] <mark721> ?
[13:57:44] <robertmaxrees> collapsed is a class, right?
[13:57:47] <mark721> yeah
[13:57:55] <robertmaxrees> then pass it a class selector
[13:58:02] <mark721> -.-
[13:58:03] <mark721> soz
[13:58:10] <mark721> i always forget ;)
[13:59:21] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/h7nhefzx/3/
[13:59:22] <robertmaxrees> fwiw.
[13:59:24] <mark721> robertmaxrees, idk if its my code or me
[13:59:29] <mark721> *or jquery
[13:59:37] <mark721> but by default class is "collapse"
[13:59:49] <robertmaxrees> *bootstrap
[13:59:49] <mark721> then when u click the class gets cleared to "" (when expanded)
[13:59:50] <robertmaxrees> not jquery
[13:59:57] <robertmaxrees> riught.
[13:59:58] <robertmaxrees> *right
[14:00:05] <robertmaxrees> if you read the docs, you'll see that's intentional
[14:00:06] <mark721> when u collapse again
[14:00:08] <mark721> it goes to
[14:00:10] <mark721> "collapsed"
[14:00:25] <mark721> why isn't it "collapsed" or "collapse" throughout?
[14:00:32] <robertmaxrees> https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/javascript/#collapse-usage
[14:00:42] <robertmaxrees> it's how the library authors wrote it.
[14:01:27] <mark721> i get that,
[14:01:31] <mark721> but im saying
[14:01:34] <mark721> on page load its "collapse"
[14:01:42] <mark721> after it becomes "collapseD"
[14:01:47] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[14:01:51] <robertmaxrees> that's just how they wrote it duder.
[14:01:54] <robertmaxrees> dunno what to tell you.
[14:01:57] <mark721> okay,
[14:02:13] <mark721> sorry, i just thought it was super odd.
[14:02:20] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/h7nhefzx/8/
[14:02:29] <robertmaxrees> here's a more fleshed-out version of what you're looking for.
[14:05:19] <mark721> but i want it done using one button
[14:05:29] <mark721> Expand all that changes to collapse all
[14:10:12] <mark721> robertmaxrees, ?
[14:10:53] <robertmaxrees> had to step away for a sec.
[14:11:31] <robertmaxrees> so you delete one button, could use a data attribute or a class to hold whether or not it should open or close, and then check that before running your logic
[14:11:58] <mark721> Can i ask ur op?
[14:12:02] <mark721> do u think its worth it
[14:12:06] <mark721> or would it just be better to write
[14:12:09] <robertmaxrees> do i think that's worth it?
[14:12:12] <mark721> Toggle Expand/Close All
[14:12:15] <mark721> as the button name
[14:12:28] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) dunno your ui
[14:12:29] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:12:42] <mark721> tell me more on how to implement pls
[14:12:46] <mark721> then ik if its worth it LOL
[14:12:56] <robertmaxrees> what about what I said doesn't make sense?
[14:13:33] <mark721> ok wait a sec
[14:13:36] <mark721> there was a bug with this
[14:13:36] <mark721> $("h4 a").filter('.collapsed').length;
[14:13:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:13:49] <mark721> no because this is related!
[14:13:59] <mark721> its how im gonna implement it
[14:14:19] <robertmaxrees> why though?
[14:14:25] <robertmaxrees> if you don't need to check, why check?
[14:14:31] <mark721> i do need to check
[14:14:35] <robertmaxrees> why?
[14:14:45] <mark721> If the user
[14:14:58] <mark721> forget it
[14:15:01] <mark721> its not even worth it nvm
[14:15:06] <mark721> i cba lol
[14:15:09] <mark721> ty :)
[14:16:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/h7nhefzx/13/
[14:16:35] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[14:16:39] <robertmaxrees> freebie for ya.
[14:16:41] <robertmaxrees> not that hard.
[14:22:27] <mark721> ik
[14:22:36] <mark721> there is a bug
[14:22:37] <mark721> though
[14:22:49] <mark721> thats the issue i had with mine. if u manually expand all of them
[14:22:52] <mark721> it still says show-all
[14:23:07] <mark721> and then u click, and then it changes to hide all
[14:23:17] <mark721> then u click again then it hides everything
[14:23:55] <taplar> you have to evaluate if the top button should change if a child changes
[14:24:25] <mark721> thats what i meant by effort :P
[14:25:18] <taplar> wha?  *looks back through the chat log*
[14:26:22] <mark721> from the beginning, the reason i came is because of that
[14:26:29] <mark721> i just never got an opportunity to explain in depth.
[14:26:46] <taplar> logically it's fairly simple
[14:27:01] <taplar> any time a child changes, re-evaluate the button.
[14:27:09] <taplar> if they are all open, it becomes close all
[14:27:17] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:27:19] <taplar> if they are all closed, it becomes open all
[14:27:19] <robertmaxrees> pretty quick.
[14:28:01] <taplar> checking for "if they are all x" is a basic check for the existance that does not match that
[14:28:30] <taplar> since true == !false
[14:52:22] <taplar> *pushes his glasses up*  obviously.... heh ... heheh........ heh
[14:55:18] <V7> Hey all
[14:55:33] <V7> So to change .click() handler it needs an id ?
[14:55:46] <taplar> more context please
[14:55:51] <V7> So, it's not possible change handler with $( button )[ 0 ] ?
[14:56:03] <taplar> [ 0 ] gets the raw dom element
[14:56:17] <V7> taplar: Also, if there're more buttons ?
[14:56:19] <taplar> back up though.  what are you trying to do?
[14:57:51] <V7> I mean, for example there're two button. We need to change click handler for first one, so if we'd write $( button )[ 0 ].click( alert( 1 ) ); this won't work, but if we'd assign it an id and then $( "#firstbutton" ).click( alert( 1 ) ); then first would work
[14:57:57] <V7> buttons *
[14:58:04] <V7> the first one *
[14:59:15] <taplar> ok, so just so i am clear.  when you say change, are you wanting to create a new one, or remove an old one and create a new one in it's place?
[14:59:28] <V7> taplar: To create a new one
[14:59:41] <V7> I mean, there're no handlers before these lines
[14:59:55] <taplar> ok, so "change" was confusing me, :)
[15:00:05] <taplar> if you want to do it without an id you can with
[15:00:19] <taplar> $( button ).eq(0).click(...)
[15:05:27] <V7> oh
[15:05:32] <V7> Thank you very much taplar
[15:05:43] <taplar> yup yup
