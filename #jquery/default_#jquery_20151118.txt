[00:32:58] <Uhkis> sorry, never tried it
[00:50:08] <Ou42> no worries
[00:50:27] <Ou42> i figured this room out! it slows down the space time continuum!
[00:50:52] <Ou42> good grief it took me that long... yet at the same time it didn't flicker. hmmm. OH I get it.
[00:58:23] <bambanx> why after load masonry all images collapse in one square http://angrycoder.io/ ?
[01:01:17] <droid909> is there a way to ignore this error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined ?
[01:01:37] <droid909> i mean, i know there either will be the value or it won't exist
[01:01:54] <droid909> i check if(obj.val.length>0)
[01:02:53] <Uhkis> you want if (obj.val)
[01:03:37] <droid909> Uhkis: ok i have other checks i.e ===3
[01:06:49] <droid909> Uhkis: i guess i can use this if (undefined !== theHref && theHref.length) {
[01:08:03] <Uhkis> if (theHref)
[01:09:31] <droid909> ?!
[01:10:50] <droid909> ohh u mean to check just the object
[01:10:52] <droid909> ok
[02:11:06] <robhol> why the Yoda comparison?
[02:12:15] <Cork> droid909: another option is (object.val||[]).length == 3

[03:17:51] <Uhkis> and this is how you prevent them
[03:18:13] <phpcoder> hello everybody
[03:19:04] <phpcoder> $("select[name=zipcode_id] option[value='" + value + "']").text()   isn't this the correct way to read the text of a select/option with a specific value ?
[03:21:57] <Uhkis> good god that selector
[03:23:41] <snover> approved
[03:25:43] <phpcoder> :D
[03:25:48] <Cork> phpcoder: you should think about using classes and ids a bit more...
[03:26:07] <Cork> but ya, that is the way (also quite the name value)
[03:26:41] <phpcoder> i also tried "#zipcode-id option[value='" + value + "']"
[03:26:59] <phpcoder> but does not work hmmm maybe because the component is inserting new option
[03:27:07] <Cork> well if the value matches what is in the tag it should work
[03:27:38] <Cork> phpcoder: that could be the cause if the selector runs before the elements has been added
[03:28:28] <jomofcw> Hello :D !
[03:28:53] <jomofcw> I come back with the smae problem than yesterday, about jQuery UI Autocomplete and the widget factory.
[03:29:13] <phpcoder> hmm maybe... let me check
[03:30:03] <phpcoder> coyes that's the reason
[03:30:12] <phpcoder> hmmm maybe this event is called before the change
[03:31:19] <Cork> phpcoder: what event?
[03:31:26] <phpcoder> i am using selectizejs
[03:31:30] <Cork> ah
[03:31:31] <phpcoder> "item_add" event
[03:31:43] <Cork> most likely
[03:32:02] <Cork> huh.. interestin, when was that added
[03:32:11] <Cork> .load can do post requests now >_>
[03:37:11] <jomofcw> Using exactly the same thing explained in the example of the API : https://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#method-_renderItem I get the error "TypeError: this._renderItem(...) is undefined" on the line "	
[03:37:11] <jomofcw> ...},_renderItemData:function(e,t){return this._renderItem(e,t).data("ui-autocomple...". Any idea how to fix it, please ?
[03:37:26] <jomofcw> Sorry for the new line :/.
[03:37:52] <Cork> jomofcw: you've overriden the renderItem function
[03:38:00] <Cork> and replaced it with undefined
[03:38:16] <Cork> have you called .removeData() on the element or something like that?
[03:38:38] <jomofcw> Cork hello ! Hm nop :/. Wait, I jsfiddle you my full script (it's not so long ;)).
[03:38:51] <Cork> make sure you can reproduce the error
[03:44:45] <jomofcw> Cork I've got some prob reproduce it but it's about the loading of jQuery UI on JSFiddle :/... https://jsfiddle.net/hdtb4mnr/1/
[03:45:26] <jomofcw> The source is originaly load using AJAX, there I just copy past the JSON response as I get it using AJAX.
[03:46:16] <Cork> jomofcw: sorry but... why are you creating a separate widget?
[03:46:27] <Cork> why not just set _renderItem on the normal autocomplete?
[03:47:00] <Cork> also... why the excessive line breaking?
[03:47:05] <jomofcw> I've tryed to add it in the option set like I add the source thing for example. But it doesn't work, it does nothing as it's not load.
[03:47:30] <jomofcw> Cork that's my default ^^. I find it more readable. I can understand that's not the main point of view :).
[03:49:26] <jomofcw> This doesn't work better : https://jsfiddle.net/hdtb4mnr/2/ , I've got no error, but the "console.log" never happen.
[03:49:42] <Cork> jomofcw: ok, i will have to clean that up just to read it
[03:50:34] <jomofcw> Searching the web i find some things about that on stackoverflow. I've tried to assign the _renderItem manually ($myAutocompleteTargetElement._renderItem = function(){...}) but it throw the same error than the widget factory.
[03:51:10] <Cork> jomofcw: https://jsfiddle.net/hdtb4mnr/3/
[03:51:10] <phpcoder> is there something to retrieve only numbers
[03:51:15] <phpcoder> from a string
[03:51:26] <Cork> jomofcw: don't read about jquery in so, it is 90% wrong information
[03:53:19] <Cork> jomofcw: ah... actually it looks like it might have changed
[03:53:25] <Cork> jomofcw: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#custom-data
[03:53:30] <lemonsparrow> what is wrong with the regex function https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/19d5346c7d1daecc578e ?
[03:53:37] <lemonsparrow> I get Unexpected token error
[03:53:43] <Cork> jomofcw: apparently later versions are suppose to use .autocomplete( "instance" )._renderItem
[03:53:47] <Cork> instead of .data()
[03:53:48] <lemonsparrow> I'm tryin to validate hostname
[03:54:37] <Cork> lemonsparrow: your not defining a regex?
[03:54:47] <Cork> you've missed the //
[03:55:03] <lemonsparrow> Cork, oh.. what is the correct syntax ? can you help
[03:55:10] <Cork> i just told you
[03:55:31] <lemonsparrow> Cork, in the beginning ?
[03:56:01] <Cork> regex (in basically every language) use // to mark the regex
[03:56:07] <Cork> like /.*/
[03:56:33] <Cork> the exception is languages where there syntax rules can't support it
[03:56:40] <Cork> like php
[03:56:47] <lemonsparrow> Cork, var re = /^(?=.{1,255}$)[0-9A-Za-z](?:(?:[0-9A-Za-z]|-){0,61}[0-9A-Za-z])?(?:\.[0-9A-Za-z](?:(?:[0-9A-Za-z]|-){0,61}[0-9A-Za-z])?)*\.?$/;
[03:56:50] <lemonsparrow> is their right ?
[03:56:52] <Cork> ya
[03:56:56] <lemonsparrow> ok
[03:57:25] <Cork> though depending on what type of hostname you want to support that won't work
[03:57:41] <Cork> punicode enterpreted host names won't match
[03:57:58] <Cork> punicode escaped won'g either actually
[03:58:01] <Cork> won
[03:58:04] <Cork> *won't
[03:58:20] <lemonsparrow> Cork, it returns true for everything :(
[03:58:50] <Cork> lemonsparrow: well that is basically what is allowed in a hostname
[03:58:56] <Cork> except space
[03:59:05] <lemonsparrow> Cork,
[03:59:14] <lemonsparrow> even 1 is returing true
[04:00:30] <jomofcw> Cork thanks for your update. Sadly, as I said, I already tryed this (and I've just tryed it again) : thrown the same error :/.
[04:01:13] <jomofcw> Wait I'm reading your other lanes :x
[04:01:14] <Cork> lemonsparrow: i'm trying to remember what (?=) does
[04:01:28] <Cork> but i don't remember of the top of my head
[04:01:35] <lemonsparrow> Cork, no I need something like a proper valid hosntmae.. not what it can contain
[04:02:02] <Cork> uh, what is the difference between can contain and valid?
[04:02:04] <lemonsparrow> Cork, http://www.regextester.com/23
[04:02:27] <Cork> lemonsparrow: it isn't in there
[04:02:54] <lemonsparrow> Cork, this one pretty much does what I want
[04:02:58] <jomofcw> Cork doesn't work better with the example of the demo page :/... it drive me crazy :D.
[04:02:59] <Cork> ah, there we go
[04:03:03] <Cork> positive look ahead
[04:04:03] <Cork> jomofcw: uh...
[04:04:14] <Cork> jomofcw: that is basically the same code i use here...
[04:04:38] <lemonsparrow> Cork, hmm
[04:05:33] <Cork> lemonsparrow: well that regex rule is exceptionally complex
[04:05:59] <lemonsparrow> Cork, ok.. this one is good
[04:05:59] <lemonsparrow> var validHostnameRegex = /^(?=.{1,255}$)[0-9A-Za-z](?:(?:[0-9A-Za-z]|-){0,61}[0-9A-Za-z])?(?:\.[0-9A-Za-z](?:(?:[0-9A-Za-z]|-){0,61}[0-9A-Za-z])?)*\.?$/;
[04:06:08] <Cork> and ya, i have a hard time seeing what it doesn't allow in the 0-9 and a-z + - range
[04:06:19] <Cork> opps and A-Z
[04:07:41] <jomofcw> Cork I'm probably using a wrong version of jQuery UI :/... can't see other solution.
[04:07:55] <Cork> jomofcw: no
[04:08:03] <Cork> the has been supported in jquery ui for ages
[04:08:13] <Cork> i've used it for over 6 years
[04:09:36] <jomofcw> OK :/... so, what could be wrong ?
[04:09:57] <Cork> har to say without seeing the error
[04:10:07] <jomofcw> It all give me the same error on the same lane.
[04:11:24] <jomofcw> Trying to do stuff with _render_Menu give me same error, on the same lane.
[04:11:29] <jomofcw> *_render
[04:11:32] <jomofcw> *_renderMenu
[04:11:33] <jomofcw> sorry
[04:20:17] <Cork> jomofcw: http://jsfiddle.net/hdtb4mnr/4/
[04:20:40] <Cork> so ya, if you should use .data('autocomplete-ui') or autocomplete('instance')
[04:20:47] <jomofcw> Cork finaly it work using the data('ui-autocomplete') to get the instance !
[04:20:51] <Cork> depends on if you use a later version or not
[04:22:35] <jomofcw> Cork thanks for your precious help, again :).
[04:22:40] <Cork> np
[04:23:01] <jomofcw> About the widget factory, my jQuery/jQuery UI is probably not on the right version to use it.
[04:23:40] <Cork> again no
[04:23:48] <Cork> but you can't define the function that way
[04:23:56] <Cork> cause it isn't stored in the widget factory
[04:24:03] <Cork> it is stored on an object on the element
[04:27:17] <jomofcw> OK Cork... in fact, my "line break evil" kill me :). The error is thrown because I had a line break between "return" and the thing I want to return... god how can I be so wrong :D.
[04:27:39] <Cork> ah, right
[04:27:45] <Cork> return is a bit special
[04:27:52] <jomofcw> Widget factory work perfectly.
[04:28:03] <jomofcw> Yea it seems to be.
[04:35:22] <robhol> jomofcw: that happens when JS tries to be "clever" about inserting semicolons
[04:35:43] <robhol> one of the dumbest "features" ever tbh
[04:54:38] <Cork> robhol: true, and more and more languages is implementing it :/
[04:56:48] <suexec> I have an array that contains objects. These objects are arrays as well ("name": unique_identifier, "timeseries": object) How can I use .inArray to search for an identifier? I have tried if($.inArray(subitem["name"],chart["timeseries"]["name"])===-1) { , but that doesn't seem to work.
[05:06:03] <suexec> nvm, I fixed it with a .each function
[05:16:17] <jomofcw> robhol thanks for the explanation ^^.
[05:19:15] <robhol> Cork: well, as long as they aren't as stupid about it as JS is. :p
[05:19:29] <robhol> But IMO it's completely unnecessary
[05:19:35] <Cork> robhol: they are following how js does it
[05:20:02] <robhol> Then it's not only unnecessary, but retarded
[05:20:09] <Cork> kinda ya
[05:20:19] <Cork> was my first comment when i saw it too
[05:43:19] <jmdrawneek> Please could someone point me in the right direct to select the first element with 2 possible data attributes? http://pastebin.com/PefUrc95
[05:43:37] <jmdrawneek> So I want the first of either of those values
[05:44:21] <Cork> find('a').filter([data-status="not-started"], [data-status="in-progress"]').first()
[05:47:02] <jmdrawneek> Cork: Ah so it gets the possible a tags then grabs the first
[05:47:07] <jmdrawneek> Cork: Thanks for that
[06:09:35] <jmdrawneek> Cork: Hmm it seems to still be returning the first in-progress
[06:19:33] <bee_keeper> Hi, I want to dfferentiate between 1. when text in an input changes and 2. when user selects from input datalist.  Any idea how hat's possible please? I have an example here -  http://jsfiddle.net/j6LdLfyo/2/
[06:29:25] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/j6LdLfyo/3/ bee_keeper ^
[06:29:42] <Kartagis> to the best of my knowledgeü
[07:33:39] <phpcoder> hello guys i would like to implement a good loader that wait the ajax content
[07:33:46] <phpcoder> could  someone give me an example?
[07:34:08] <Cork> wait the what?
[07:34:22] <Cork> you mean display a loader while the ajax loads?
[07:35:12] <phpcoder> Cork, exactly :D
[07:35:22] <phpcoder> thwre are two problems...
[07:35:30] <Cork> phpcoder: just display what you want to show before you start the ajax call
[07:35:40] <Cork> and hide it in a .always callback
[07:36:13] <phpcoder> 1. how to display this loader with a shadow in background....and what happen if the content will be loaded fasten ?
[07:36:43] <Cork> phpcoder: there are a few different solutions for that
[07:36:53] <phpcoder> i mean... i would like to display to loader for 1 sec (if the page load before 1 sec) and more than 1 sec if the page takes more time
[07:37:00] <Cork> depending on what the oldest browser you need to support is
[07:37:12] <phpcoder> above ie 8
[07:37:18] <Cork> but the simplest solution is to just put a position: fixed; element on the page
[07:37:25] <Cork> and just set a rgba color on it
[07:38:38] <phpcoder> Cork, what about the time ?
[07:38:49] <Cork> the .always is always called
[07:38:58] <Cork> so there won't be a race condition
[07:39:35] <phpcoder> Cork, yes...but if the page loading takes less than 1 sec i would like to show the loader 1 sec (minimun)
[07:39:40] <phpcoder> otherwise it will be too fast
[07:40:19] <Cork> you could take a date stamp before the ajax starts
[07:40:34] <Cork> and then calculate how much time has passed in the always callback
[07:40:43] <Cork> and use a setTimeout for the difference
[07:40:50] <Cork> (if bigger then 0)
[07:40:57] <phpcoder> Cork, awesome
[07:41:15] <phpcoder> last thing..is there a callback that is called before the sending of the request?
[07:41:20] <phpcoder> i can put this logic there
[07:42:12] <taplar> beforeSend
[07:42:51] <Cork> i find it better to just do it before the ajax call
[07:42:57] <Cork> but ya beforeSend is an option
[07:43:24] <phpcoder> awesome
[07:43:32] <phpcoder> for timestime i can use Date() directly ?
[07:43:40] <Cork> new Date()
[07:43:48] <phpcoder> .getTIme()?
[07:43:49] <phpcoder> ah ok
[07:44:12] <Cork> Date.UTC() is an option
[07:44:20] <Cork> ah, no sorry
[07:44:41] <phpcoder> loadingStart = new Date().getTime();
[07:44:43] <phpcoder> no ?
[07:45:04] <rohanpassi> Hi, I'm new and I would like to contribute, can someone get me started?
[07:45:08] <Cork> you don't have to convert it to a number
[07:45:29] <Cork> rohanpassi: https://contribute.jquery.org/
[07:45:37] <phpcoder> cork so i can just do data2-data1 ?
[07:45:42] <Cork> ya
[07:45:44] <phpcoder> without any conversion ?
[07:45:47] <phpcoder> perfect
[07:46:17] <phpcoder> and i will pass the result to settimeout
[07:46:34] <Cork> well what you want is something like
[07:47:18] <Cork> var diff = (new Date()) - oldTime; if(diff < 1000) { setTimeout(func, diff - 1000); } else { func() }
[07:48:42] <phpcoder> thank you so much!!!
[07:50:45] <phpcoder> Cork, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f3e96f670d6e4708c4fa
[07:50:49] <phpcoder> what do you think?
[07:51:22] <Cork> you don't create global variables
[07:51:39] <Cork> startLoadingData = new Date(); <--
[07:52:40] <hellyeah> hey
[07:52:53] <hellyeah> is it legal to do like that https://jsfiddle.net/gkwhayj2/ data attr of button
[07:54:13] <phpcoder> Cork, why wrong ?
[07:54:22] <phpcoder> oooh
[07:54:24] <phpcoder> pardon
[07:54:32] <anli> I have a 500, seems like I cannot see the post data in chrome dev tools, should I see it?
[07:54:32] <Cork> phpcoder: that is the same as window.startLoadingData
[07:54:40] <phpcoder> i forgot one line above i hav e var startLoadingData
[07:54:48] <Cork> ok
[07:54:53] <phpcoder> Cork, conflict ?
[07:54:58] <Cork> nope
[07:55:01] <Cork> that's fine
[07:55:08] <phpcoder> ok
[07:55:14] <anli> Oh, now I see it...
[07:55:16] <anli> strange
[08:09:49] <P3nnyw1se> hi guys I have 0 experience here..    from a datatable I created a gridview in aspx. on a monitor that is not suppose to have user interactions.  it display more rows than my monitor can display, so I want to scroll slowly down the gridview untill it reaches the end. Tried googling for a while but didn't have any luck
[08:46:46] <norc> Hi. Im using fadeOut() on a div element. Is there a way to make the transition smooth when the element is removed?
[08:59:32] <Cork> norc: you want to wait for the animation to complete before removing it
[08:59:43] <Cork> there is a callback for when the animation is complete
[09:00:08] <norc> Cork: Ah gotcha. Guess I can then just slideUp for example?
[09:00:15] <norc> In that callback I mean
[09:00:27] <Cork> ah, ya
[09:00:45] <Cork> though if you want to do it like that you can't use fadeOut
[09:00:52] <Cork> you animate of opacity instead
[09:01:05] <Cork> and then do slideUp
[09:18:09] <broman> is there any way to .css('background-image',...) show a loading gif while the image isn't ready??
[09:20:26] <taplar> you might could layer the element on top of another element that has that loading image
[09:23:11] <broman> ?
[09:24:46] <taplar> the element that your loading could be encapsulated in a parent that has the busy image as it's background, so that when the child element loads, it simply overlays the busy image.  or using position and z-index two different elements where you do the same concept but you put the image your loading on top of the other with a higher z-index
[09:28:47] <broman> taplar, got it.. I'll try
[09:30:58] <broman> also.. how can i call a js to be executed? i need to have a file containing callToMethod("params") and i need to load and execute this call...
[09:31:05] <broman> the method is defined by the caller jquery
[09:31:41] <taplar> how is the call defined?
[09:32:10] <phpcoder> guys
[09:32:18] <phpcoder> someone could tell me what is the effect
[09:32:24] <phpcoder> of the loading (right side)
[09:32:28] <phpcoder> on booking ?
[09:32:45] <phpcoder> booking.com when i do a filter...booking show me grey blocks
[09:32:57] <phpcoder> "as loaders"
[09:33:11] <phpcoder> do a simple search on booking.com...i would like to understand what is the effect
[09:41:08] <broman> taplar, ? what do you mean? on the index, i have a defined function (function a() { })... now i want, from index, to call and execute a file containing the following: a();
[09:42:42] <taplar> so is the function in a document ready?
[09:43:01] <taplar> i need more information about the functions scope
[09:44:05] <broman> this is the function: ###function mudaEncosto(img) {$("#encosto").attr("src", img);}### this is what im going to receive: ###mudaEncosto('19.png');###
[09:44:30] <taplar> that's not telling me it's scope
[09:44:42] <taplar> create a fiddle with an example
[09:45:17] <broman> what part exactly aren't you understanding?
[09:45:28] <broman> i need to load a call function
[09:45:34] <broman> and execute that call
[09:45:35] <broman> just that
[09:45:40] <taplar> that's the logic, not the scope
[09:45:56] <taplar> is the function wrapped in anything? or is it just that funciton alone?
[09:46:50] <broman> this is just it! done! the simplest it could be
[09:47:41] <taplar> alright, so your now wanting to move that into a js file?
[09:48:09] <broman> no
[09:48:16] <broman> ok... i will explain it better to you
[09:49:19] <broman> i have a index file which contains that above described function... this works cool! i want to dynamically pass the arguments to it by grabing them from a xhmlrequest.... i need to the the params from the request and then EXECUTE the function passing these parameters...
[09:49:37] <taplar> ok?
[09:49:50] <taplar> so just call it
[09:49:54] <broman> ?
[09:50:01] <taplar> it's a global function, just execute it
[09:50:19] <broman> taplar, how can i do that from the outside params file?
[09:50:25] <broman> i need to load and execute.. how can i do that?
[09:50:39] <taplar> ajax has a success callback that you can use
[09:50:43] <taplar> you would do it in there
[09:51:28] <slax0r> if index.html defines a function, and loads a myjs.js file you can call that function defined in index.html from myjs.js, although you might have issues if you include myjs.js in some other .html where that function has not been defined
[09:52:01] <taplar> so long as the function is defined before the attempt to execute it, your fine
[09:52:43] <taplar> regardless of source origin
[10:07:08] <hellyeah> yo
[10:07:32] <hellyeah> i will explain my aim but why JSON.stringify didnt work here https://jsfiddle.net/0wy6zgsu/1/
[10:17:11] <taplar> lowercase s on stringify
[10:19:55] <hellyeah> humm
[10:21:19] <hellyeah> taplar: it doesnt look like json string i want to build a json string from project_name, environment and frontend do you have any suggestion?
[10:22:35] <taplar> just stringify the element
[10:25:24] <hellyeah> taplar: actually i know that but i dont want to get all element i want to construct am array which has two index. First index contain stringify of project_name, environment and frontend. Second index has Info
[10:26:29] <taplar> uh, put in your fiddle what your desired result looks like
[10:30:09] <Guest56037> within the submit function of a form: what is 'this'? it does not seem to be a plainObject and it does not seem to be a jQuery object. how can i detect it?
[10:30:37] <taplar> this would be the context, so it would be the form
[10:31:53] <Guest56037> how can i check for it?
[10:32:16] <taplar> you don't.  it's an event handler so it's already known
[10:32:49] <Guest56037> but i cannot use jquery methods. i have to wrap $() around it. so i would like to check if i have to or not
[10:33:14] <taplar> if it's a straight event handler that is not invoked any other way, you will always have to wrap it to use jquery functions
[10:33:38] <taplar> otherwise you can possibly use a cached reference
[10:34:05] <taplar> like if you only had one form on the page
[10:34:17] <Guest56037> there is no safe way to check whether its an event handler or not?
[10:34:30] <taplar> var $myform = $('form');  $myform.on('submit', function() { /* i can use $myform in here */});
[10:35:40] <taplar> are you calling the function outside of an event handler?
[10:38:39] <hellyeah> taplar:
[10:38:47] <hellyeah> it may sound ridicilious
[10:38:51] <hellyeah> or absurd to you
[10:38:59] <hellyeah> but i am just regular worker here
[10:39:21] <hellyeah> anyway i will check tomorrow thanks for suggestion
[10:39:33] <taplar> ?
[10:40:14] <hellyeah> taplar: i will check this problem
[10:40:26] <hellyeah> you give good suggestion
[10:40:35] <hellyeah> so i said thank you from today for tomorrow
[10:40:37] <hellyeah> :D
[10:41:00] <taplar> did i suggest something to you?  last i asked for you to put an example of your desired json in your fiddle
[10:41:32] <hellyeah> you have always good suggestion
[10:41:35] <hellyeah> anyway gotta go
[10:41:43] <taplar> cool
[10:51:03] <rivarun> hello. when using $("#elem").load("/some/url"), my server seems to understand something different than a plain GET request, and returns 500 while trying to jsonify some data, instead of returning a HTML.  does .load() do something differently than a plain GET request?
[10:52:32] <slax0r> you can check it out yourself in chrome dev tools i.e. in the network tab
[10:52:37] <slax0r> and other browsers have similar tools too
[10:53:24] <rivarun> i have, but i don't see anything fishy. perhaps the fact that X-Requested-With is XMLHttpRequest?
[10:55:53] <slax0r> well, this could be an issue only if the server checks that and does something differently then
[10:55:56] <slax0r> normally it shouldn't
[10:55:58] <slax0r> debug server side code
[10:57:09] <rivarun> right, i see. this isn't otherwise set. so indeed my problem should be the server side doing more than i expect it to. thanks slax0r
[10:59:54] <rivarun> yep, there was indeed some magic there specific to xhr
[11:01:31] <cariaso> I like http://arthurgouveia.com/prettyCheckable/ but the 'More area of click/touch' is causing problems. any way to disable or alternative libraries?
[11:22:41] <silverdust> Is the jQuery('elem:eq(n)') something unique to just jQuery or is there a CSS selector as such?
[11:25:24] <taplar> :nth-child is similar to :eq
[11:25:33] <taplar> the offset is different between the two
[11:26:43] <silverdust> but I can also use nth-child() with jQuery right? Never had a reason to use it
[11:26:57] <taplar> sure
[11:27:38] <silverdust> I see es uses indexes like ordinal numbers
[11:27:46] <silverdust> * eq
[11:28:43] <silverdust> so :eq(1) will mean second where :nth-child(1) means first
[11:29:12] <taplar> index vs offset
[11:29:36] <silverdust> um I meant cardinal
[11:29:37] <silverdust> okay
[11:37:22] <lc23> anyone good a jqurey and sharepoint lits
[11:46:34] <lyhr> when using statements like $("header").hide();  $(".someclass").unwrap(); will this code change the source code that can be viewed or only change how it is rendered for display
[11:57:41] <taplar> lyhr: should should be changing the dom.  i don't believe they change the source
[11:57:58] <lyhr> taplar: ok TY
[13:13:42] * crickets chirps
[13:15:51] <phpcoder> guys i have these two methos https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d673992670acb0a48908
[13:15:57] <phpcoder> how can i add a good fade effect ?
[13:16:36] <robertmaxrees> by using .animate() or css transitions or fadeIn or....
[13:16:48] <taplar> hide also takes an optional duration
[13:17:14] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  tons of options.  really vague problem statement ;)
[13:17:24] <phpcoder> taplar, a callback too ?
[13:17:33] <phpcoder> i mean...i would like to add a fadein/out
[13:17:36] <taplar> looks like it has a complete callback
[13:17:54] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/hide/
[13:17:56] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder did you even try searching google?
[13:18:41] <phpcoder> not yet you are my first assistants :D
[13:18:50] <robertmaxrees> we're not your google.
[13:19:01] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:19:47] <phpcoder> ahahah
[13:19:48] <phpcoder> :D
[13:20:18] <phpcoder> however does hide have the animation?
[13:20:20] <phpcoder> i search
[13:20:21] <phpcoder> :D
[13:20:31] <robertmaxrees> thanksy
[13:43:03] <defdom0> hello
[13:43:15] <robertmaxrees> good morning.
[13:51:05] <dlman> for jqueryui, does the drag and drop work for cells in a table?
[13:51:23] <taplar> iirc, no
[13:51:27] <taplar> well
[13:51:37] <taplar> you mean dragging and dropping cells themselves?
[13:53:36] <dlman> yes
[13:53:51] <dlman> I want to drag and drop cells into another area of the website
[13:53:55] <taplar> yeah, i don't believe so.
[13:54:12] <dlman> Any library that allows that?
[13:54:21] <robertmaxrees> probably not with tables.
[13:54:27] <robertmaxrees> since they're a PITA>
[13:54:28] <taplar> iirc, you'd need to construct your table with divs or something of the like that looks like a table for it to work
[13:54:50] <dlman> well I'm using react to sorta dynamically construct my tables
[13:55:02] <robertmaxrees> that's... entirely irrelevant?
[13:55:06] <robertmaxrees> it's still a table.
[13:55:10] <robertmaxrees> need to use divs or something else.
[13:55:36] <dlman> can I just do something like <div><td></td></div> for each cell?
[13:55:48] <taplar> no, that's invalid syntaxc
[13:55:49] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:01:43] <dlman> what about <span> inside a <td>?
[14:02:17] <robertmaxrees> sure?  that's kind of making it harder than it needs to be.
[14:02:27] <robertmaxrees> just build a grid without using a table.
[14:25:41] <phpcoder> grrr chrome and firefox works differently if i need two divs witht he same height!!!!!
[14:25:43] <phpcoder> grrrr
[14:25:58] <taplar> hmm?
[14:27:22] <phpcoder> taplar, basically i have to extend a div for all the height
[14:27:30] <phpcoder> but it works differently in chrome and firefox
[14:27:44] <phpcoder> i am seeing plugin like https://github.com/liabru/jquery-match-height
[14:28:14] <taplar> have you tried display:table-cell and all those css options?
[14:28:43] <robertmaxrees> https://css-tricks.com/fluid-width-equal-height-columns/
[14:28:52] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[14:28:54] <phpcoder> taplar, yes
[14:29:09] <robertmaxrees> if that guide doesn't help, then you've got something fundamentally broken about your cod.e
[14:29:54] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, basically if i use table-cell it works....BUT if i create a div inside a column it does not extend
[14:29:59] <phpcoder> to the entire height
[14:30:02] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder read the guide.
[14:30:07] <phpcoder> i use height:100% but nothing
[14:30:07] <robertmaxrees> all will be answered.
[14:30:07] <phpcoder> ok
[14:30:08] <phpcoder> thanks
[14:41:52] <taplar> bow chicka wow, i'm just a code farmer, ridin' my rafactor
[14:42:16] <taplar> ugh, i need some youtube
[14:42:58] <_Noobie_> can anyone help me with this, http://kopy.io/NpkwV.  I need to get the ?id= from the url and append it to .getJSON call.
[14:43:20] <robertmaxrees> from the current URL?
[14:43:22] <robertmaxrees> like, of the page?>
[14:43:26] <_Noobie_> Yes
[14:44:12] <robertmaxrees> you could use somethng like http://stevenbenner.com/2010/03/javascript-regex-trick-parse-a-query-string-into-an-object/
[14:45:09] <_Noobie_> Awesome.  I'm looking at it now.
[14:45:10] <_Noobie_> Thanks
[14:45:26] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, grab the window.location.search and use string split or whatever to parse it.
[15:07:40] <Ou42> hello, #jquery!
[15:07:51] <Ou42> BANANA
[15:07:57] <robertmaxrees> uh, hello.
[15:08:04] <Ou42> hey
[15:08:25] <Ou42> I can't get the demo at http://api.jquerymobile.com/responsive-grid/ to work
[15:08:39] <Ou42> in page it works, but when I copy/paste the code and run locally it doesn't work for me in FF
[15:08:47] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[15:08:55] <robertmaxrees> any errors?
[15:10:53] <Ou42> setting up... on a different system... ( last night, the ans was "no" )
[15:11:18] <Ou42> and by answer i mean the answer to your Q now. this place is rather quite.
[15:11:23] <Ou42> quiet even.
[15:11:34] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty obvious ;)
[15:11:38] <taplar> comes and goes
[15:12:20] <Ou42> no errors
[15:12:27] <robertmaxrees> then show me your code.
[15:12:43] <robertmaxrees> and don't say "i just copied and pasted it from that page" - make a gist or something :)
[15:12:46] <Ou42> it's copy/pasted exactly from the link above
[15:12:55] <Ou42> stop reading my mind
[15:12:56] <robertmaxrees> right, read what i just said :)
[15:13:09] <Ou42> hold on.
[15:14:30] <Ou42> ok, how?
[15:14:38] <robertmaxrees> copy/paste the page source into a gist.
[15:14:41] <robertmaxrees> let's start there.
[15:14:52] <robertmaxrees> like, there could be all kinds of things that you did wrong.
[15:14:57] <Ou42> where's a gist? wouldn't it be easier for you to see the code listing at the bottom of that page?
[15:15:04] <Ou42> i did nothing wrong
[15:15:10] <Ou42> i copy/pasted just now, no edits
[15:15:12] <robertmaxrees> obviously you DID.
[15:15:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:15:20] <Ou42> impossible
[15:15:34] <Ou42> but
[15:15:39] <robertmaxrees> okay, are you running this off a webserver?
[15:15:43] <Ou42> no
[15:15:43] <robertmaxrees> or just opening a file locally?
[15:15:46] <Ou42> locally
[15:16:00] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[15:16:07] <Ou42> seriously?
[15:16:11] <Ou42> no way
[15:16:11] <robertmaxrees> <script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script> doesn't work
[15:16:18] <Ou42> hold on
[15:16:24] <robertmaxrees> need to change that to include the http: in front
[15:16:41] <taplar> that will actually work
[15:17:49] <Ou42> that's lame
[15:17:51] <Ou42> i don't like it
[15:17:54] <Ou42> fix it another way
[15:17:56] <Ou42> :p
[15:17:57] <robertmaxrees> not lame at all.
[15:18:03] <Ou42> why no error message?
[15:18:09] <robertmaxrees> check your network tab.
[15:18:16] <robertmaxrees> the js never loaded, so there's no js error to report.
[15:18:18] <robertmaxrees> it's a 404 instead.
[15:18:34] <robertmaxrees> because the URL was resolving to file://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js
[15:18:46] <taplar> ah, lol
[15:18:58] <Ou42> still no error message
[15:19:09] <robertmaxrees> did you update ALL the JS urls?
[15:20:06] <robertmaxrees> and css url
[15:21:01] <Ou42> rewind
[15:21:05] <Ou42> i undid the fix. it's lame.
[15:21:07] <Ou42> j/k
[15:21:12] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:21:38] <Ou42> no, i'm asking, why the original missing "http" version does not have any errors/warnings.
[15:21:45] <Ou42> i'm going thru the web dev in FF and see nothign.
[15:21:48] <robertmaxrees> i just explained it.
[15:21:53] <robertmaxrees> the network tab will have 404s.
[15:21:58] <Ou42> it doesn't
[15:22:04] <robertmaxrees> but no js loaded, so there are no js errors to display.
[15:22:11] <robertmaxrees> i don't believe you.
[15:23:22] <Ou42> given that i didn't see the lacking "http" it's possible i'm not at the correct "network tab"
[15:23:30] <Ou42> so i accept your lack of faith
[15:23:32] <Ou42> :p
[15:23:39] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/1145oev9/
[15:23:46] <robertmaxrees> Ou42 what browser are you in?
[15:23:52] <robertmaxrees> and are you sure you're not filtering anything out?
[15:26:29] <Ou42> not that i know of. I'm using... FF ... wait for it...
[15:26:38] <Ou42> and i hope you aren't lactose intollerant
[15:26:40] <Ou42> 42
[15:26:42] <Ou42> :D
[15:27:06] <robertmaxrees> ah, firefox network tab quirk. check it out in chrome and you'll see the 404s.
[15:27:18] <Ou42> taplar: thanks, but I don't know what to do with the fiddle
[15:27:35] <Ou42> grrrrr
[15:27:35] <taplar> i was just showing you can leave off the leading protocal
[15:27:37] <robertmaxrees> taplar uuuuhhh.,.
[15:27:39] <robertmaxrees> that is that fiddle.
[15:27:46] <robertmaxrees> *what is that fiddle.
[15:28:06] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/1145oev9/1/
[15:28:09] <robertmaxrees> at least half use it right.
[15:28:31] <taplar> that doesn't show my point though
[15:28:35] <robertmaxrees> yes it does.
[15:29:06] <Ou42> what was that point? that jsfiddle bypasses the need for "http"?
[15:29:18] <robertmaxrees> that using a server bypasses the need for protocol.
[15:29:25] <robertmaxrees> it's relative.
[15:29:32] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/tuOQbAS.png taplar
[15:29:51] <taplar> ah, didn't know you could do the hover thing
[15:30:05] <taplar> but yeah, if you leave off the protocol it just uses the same protocol the page load used
[15:30:21] <robertmaxrees> right, relative URLs :)
[15:30:37] <taplar> which if you have an http/https intermixed website can be handy
[15:31:00] <robertmaxrees> only way i roll these days.
[15:31:39] <taplar> guess i misunderstood part of the discussion.  thought you were saying that didn't work, :/
[15:31:46] <robertmaxrees> i was saying it does.
[15:31:55] <robertmaxrees> and it was working as written before.
[15:32:10] <robertmaxrees> the issue was he was running the file locally off his hard drive and not through a local webserver,.
[15:32:28] <taplar> gotcha
[15:42:21] <Ou42> so, for web dev it is advisable to run thru a webserver?
[15:42:32] <robertmaxrees> depends, but generally yes.
[15:42:37] <robertmaxrees> more often than not.
[15:44:40] <Ou42> sorry for the knee jerk, but, why?
[15:44:51] <robertmaxrees> uh
[15:44:52] <taplar> consistency
[15:44:57] <robertmaxrees> well i mean, it's more indicative of a live box.
[15:45:00] <Ou42> and/or what's the benefit of leaving off the "http"?
[15:45:04] <robertmaxrees> and you have fewer issues like the one you JUST had.
[15:45:07] <robertmaxrees> we also already covered that.
[15:45:16] <robertmaxrees> it's relative to the protocol you're using.
[15:45:39] <Ou42> my perspective would be to be explicit would be better
[15:45:43] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[15:45:45] <robertmaxrees> harder to maintain
[15:45:57] <Ou42> when would it ever change protocol?
[15:46:11] <robertmaxrees> if you have a public facing site and a section behind login.
[15:46:15] <NoiseEee> Ou42: dev vs production, for example
[15:46:19] <robertmaxrees> that too.
[15:46:28] <robertmaxrees> all sorts of cases.
[15:47:11] <Ou42> NoiseEee: that's a reply to which Q? the relative path or just local dev using a webserver?
[15:47:30] <NoiseEee> Ou42: for referencing something without the protocol
[15:47:46] <robertmaxrees> hell, relative without the domain is convenient, too.
[15:47:57] <taplar> true
[15:48:13] <Ou42> you're both... all ... skipping something basic
[15:48:21] <robertmaxrees> and that is?
[15:48:21] <Ou42> y'all get it. i don't.
[15:48:29] <robertmaxrees> what don't you get?
[15:48:30] <Ou42> explain it to a 3 year old
[15:48:38] <robertmaxrees> it makes you type less.
[15:48:45] <Ou42> LOL
[15:48:50] <NoiseEee> and works in all places
[15:49:03] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:49:03] <Ou42> if i add "http://" i have to have the full path?
[15:49:36] <robertmaxrees> yes.  and then if you put part of your site behind https, end users will get warnings about mixed security
[15:49:36] <taplar> if you have http:// and you try to use it on an https page, you get the nice, 'you are trying to access insecure elements on a secure page'
[15:50:14] <taplar> which to a user, at worst can be scary
[15:50:15] <robertmaxrees> omitting the protocol/domain makes local development easier, too.
[15:50:20] <taplar> and at best, look trashy
[15:51:32] <robertmaxrees> that answer your question?
[15:51:40] <Ou42> ok & if a relative path is needed... how does the server know it's a local file vs a "relative protocol"?
[15:52:14] <robertmaxrees> it parses it out.
[15:52:34] <robertmaxrees> and not the server.
[15:52:35] <robertmaxrees> the browser.
[15:52:44] <robertmaxrees> the browser fills all that in - it's a relative URL in both cases.
[15:53:04] <robertmaxrees> exact same mechanism that lets you use href="/about.html" and it just works.
[15:55:39] <Ou42> ok but the "//" tells the browser "use same 'protocol' "
[15:55:48] <Ou42> otherwise it is looking for a local file
[15:56:03] <robertmaxrees> the browser isn't looking at files.
[15:56:05] <robertmaxrees> it's looking at paths.
[15:56:18] <robertmaxrees> and it likely parses out and recognizes there's a domain with no protocol.
[15:56:39] <robertmaxrees> exactly how it determines that likely changes from browser to browse.r
[15:56:48] <Ou42> so, is "//" root?
[15:56:54] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:57:16] <Ou42> too much. I'm gonna take my 81% and call it a day.
[15:57:21] <Ou42> :p
[15:57:28] <Ou42> +5 bonus points
[15:57:34] <Ou42> maybe some extra credit
[15:57:44] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Understanding_URLs if you want reading material.
[15:57:49] <Ou42> and i'll bring y'all a virtual apple next time.
[15:59:09] <Ou42> follow up to the webserver local web dev setup. any suggestions on security/perfered installations? would installing one insides a VM in VMware be safer?
[15:59:39] <robertmaxrees> errr, what sort of security implications would there be to installing a local webserver?
[15:59:49] <taplar> basic tomcat or apache install is fine
[16:00:17] <robertmaxrees> nginx is cool, too.
[16:00:28] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't worry too much about running it in a vm or anything like that.
[16:01:18] <robertmaxrees> it's just a webserver.  don't point it to your base system drive and you're fine.
[16:01:20] <taplar> crap, i'm forgetting the acronym.  there are also some prebuilt ones out there that combine install a server, scripting language and a database for you
[16:01:29] <robertmaxrees> LAMP or WAMP
[16:01:32] <taplar> yeah ^
[16:01:47] <robertmaxrees> xampp is a common package.
[16:02:12] <robertmaxrees> if you're using node, you don't even need a webserver - you can hit it directly.
[16:02:39] <NoiseEee> Ou42: certainly developing on a VM seems to be standard practice / best practice these days
[16:02:59] <robertmaxrees> depending on what you're doing imo.
[16:03:04] <Ou42> i may have node.. but I"m obviously ignorant there. it was installed during the Cordova install.
[16:03:25] <NoiseEee> Ou42: using Vagrant to get a common install among developers;  the VM you choose should match the OS you have in production, and you can just map its "webroot" (and other) directories to local folders on your OS
[16:03:40] <NoiseEee> but sure i guess it depends what your'e doing
[16:04:05] <robertmaxrees> NoiseEee that's only helpful if you're doing webapps.  for most static sites/wp setups, that seems like overkill.
[16:04:11] <Ou42> whatever it is I'm doing, I'm doing it the hard way. I assure you. ;)
[16:04:20] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[16:04:48] <Ou42> the same thing we do everyday, Pinky!
[16:05:00] <Ou42> sorry, couldn't resist.
[16:05:40] <Ou42> I'm just learning at this point. I'm not really well versed to know what I'm actually trying to do. I do have an Android ( via Cordova ) app in the works... which is using jQ / jQM which brings me here.
[16:06:08] <robertmaxrees> so that has its own separate set of constraints from building a website then.
[16:07:37] <Ou42> off topic/and possibly slightly on topic...
[16:07:59] <Ou42> once i added the "http" and it worked, i get a ton of js/css errors/warnings. is this OK?
[16:08:15] <robertmaxrees> noe.
[16:08:16] <robertmaxrees> *no
[16:08:20] <robertmaxrees> what are the errors you're getting?
[16:08:30] <Ou42> they all seem to come from the jQ file itself.
[16:08:44] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't answer my question ;)
[16:09:47] <Ou42> Unknown property '-moz-box-shadow'.  Declaration dropped. jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.css:3:175227
[16:09:57] <robertmaxrees> that's fine
[16:10:06] <Ou42> Expected 'none', URL, or filter function but found 'Alpha('.  Error in parsing value for 'filter'.  Declaration dropped. jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.css:3:176162
[16:10:45] <robertmaxrees> yeah you're fine
[16:11:18] <Ou42> the "poss slightly on topic" Q is:
[16:11:30] <Ou42> jQmobile has a way to
[16:12:11] <Ou42> use
[16:12:13] <Ou42> http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/
[16:12:35] <Ou42> so, in essence, picking out the minimum jqm stuff i use?
[16:12:46] <robertmaxrees> sort of, yes
[16:13:14] <Ou42> then packaging that locally? benefit(s) would be smaller app/website size ( faster boot up)
[16:13:22] <Ou42> and not being "online"
[16:13:46] <robertmaxrees> sure, but that's premature optimization.
[16:13:56] <Ou42> ah, the root of all evil.
[16:13:58] <robertmaxrees> unless you have a real reason to worry, don't.
[16:14:41] <Ou42> OK
[16:15:10] <Ou42> do you rem my .table() q from before?
[16:15:24] <robertmaxrees> ish?
[16:16:38] <Ou42> the error message confused me. don't have it handy, but the answer is:
[16:16:40] <Ou42> $("table").table().table("refresh");
[16:17:07] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what you're talking about then.
[16:17:09] <Ou42> "method chaining" but also needing to call .table() first
[16:18:06] <Ou42> i didn't understand the error message and came asking about selectors... as the error message was saying something about "table" not existing. or that i couldn't call a method on an uninitialized element or something
[16:18:12] <Ou42> the element existed prior to this line.
[16:18:24] <Ou42> the way i was calling it was probably, $("table").table("refresh");
[16:18:41] <robertmaxrees> it was probably complaining that you were calling something that hadn't been initialized.
[16:18:49] <robertmaxrees> why are you refreshing it on init?
[16:19:11] <Ou42> not sure if i'm refreshing it on init
[16:19:22] * Ou42 does things the hard way
[16:19:30] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to accomplish?
[16:20:16] <Ou42> i'm parsing a table that i get via an ajax call... reformatting it... then jQM-ifiying it. then i have to refresh it or the changes don't show.
[16:20:48] <robertmaxrees> $( ".selector" ).table({defaults: true});
[16:20:49] <robertmaxrees> try that.
[16:21:10] <Ou42> wouldn't work
[16:21:15] <Ou42> $("table").table().table("refresh"); // works.
[16:21:23] <robertmaxrees> then you're doing something wrong.
[16:21:24] <robertmaxrees> bummer.
[16:21:54] <Ou42> and here i thought i was "giving back" *shrugs*
[16:22:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:22:13] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need to init the table and then immediately refresh it.
[16:22:32] <Ou42> yeah, seems fishy
[16:22:44] <Ou42> but the table is coming from the ajax... so it's not on the page when the page loads.
[16:22:49] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:22:53] <robertmaxrees> you should be able to just init.
[16:22:56] <robertmaxrees> not init then refresh.
[16:22:58] <robertmaxrees> that's my entire point.
[16:23:19] <Ou42> ah
[16:23:28] <Ou42> so, $("table").table(); // should be enough?
[16:25:19] <Ou42> even after appending the ajax response to .html() of some other element?
[16:25:25] <robertmaxrees> ues/
[16:25:26] <robertmaxrees> &yes
[16:25:31] <robertmaxrees> you're manually initializing it.
[16:26:05] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need to init and then immediately refresh.  that's really strange.
[16:28:26] <Ou42> w/o completely understanding this, I agree.
[16:28:28] <Ou42> hard to test
[16:28:35] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[16:28:45] <Ou42> i can't do ajax locally
[16:28:49] <robertmaxrees> nope.  don't need to.
[16:28:51] <Ou42> i have to compile the Cordova
[16:28:53] <robertmaxrees> just need to inject markup.
[16:28:59] <robertmaxrees> don't need that either.
[16:29:03] <Ou42> ah
[16:29:08] <Ou42> static copy here we come
[16:29:29] <Ou42> i had a ver that did this. one moment
[16:31:13] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/99wn2h5e/1/
[16:32:57] <robertmaxrees> less than 2 minutes to make a functioning fiddle that dynamically appends a table to an element ;)
[16:33:27] <robertmaxrees> also: if you can't do ajax locally, how are you using it?>
[16:33:36] <Ou42> cordova
[16:33:42] <Ou42> it has a whitelist
[16:33:45] <robertmaxrees> err, so you don't even test it first?
[16:34:05] <robertmaxrees> like, you should be able to use ajax locally.
[16:34:35] <Ou42> memory is fuzzy, i was working with a static copy ( which i forgot ) and got it working then switched over to ajax in the cordova app and it worked.
[16:34:46] <Ou42> i'm hitting that CORS issue.
[16:34:58] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:35:00] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[16:35:03] <fas3r> Hello
[16:35:06] <Ou42> the ajax call is blocked because I'm not on the same domain
[16:35:27] <Ou42> fas3r: hello
[16:35:30] <robertmaxrees> and with that, lunch.
[16:35:31] <robertmaxrees> byeeeeeeeee
[16:35:38] <Ou42> TTFN
[16:35:57] <fas3r> is it posible to know if a click was trigger from the user or jquery ("trigger")  ?
[16:37:48] <Ou42> NoiseEee?
[16:37:49] <NoiseEee> i don't think so fas3r, does it matter?
[16:37:58] <NoiseEee> Ou42: ?
[16:38:04] <Ou42> ha! I guessed right! ;)
[16:38:29] <Ou42> taplar: you were next. :p
[16:39:28] <fas3r> NoiseEee: hahha no it was just by curiousity. As trigger() function is suppose to trigger an event I was wondering if it's possible to distingue it.
[16:40:22] <phpcoder> hi
[16:40:27] <phpcoder> someone read me ?
[16:41:09] <NoiseEee> fas3r: im not positive, maybe inspect the event
[16:41:17] <NoiseEee> yes phpcoder we see you
[16:41:32] <phpcoder> ok i had problem with ruoter
[16:41:35] <phpcoder> thanks NoiseEee
[16:42:32] <phpcoder> NoiseEee, please could you check http://www.booking.com/searchresults.sr.html?city=-126693&nflt=ht_id%3D201%3B     if you select a filter on the left you will see the grey boxes on the right side (As loading)... take a look at the effect....what is this ?
[16:42:41] <phpcoder> i am trying to reproduce the same thing
[16:49:55] <NoiseEee> go for it
[16:50:12] <NoiseEee> phpcoder: basically just show/hide <divs> and/or change styles
[16:50:48] <phpcoder> NoiseEee, ? i see a shadow from left to right (continuos)
[16:51:51] <NoiseEee> its just css animation
[16:54:23] <phpcoder> NoiseEee, yes but
[16:54:30] <phpcoder> what is the name of this animation
[16:54:34] <phpcoder> i have to do the same thing
[16:54:40] <phpcoder> i am looking for an example
[16:54:52] <NoiseEee> "css animation"
[16:55:19] <NoiseEee> phpcoder: you can use libraries or what have you, just google about it
[16:55:32] <NoiseEee> https://github.com/daneden/animate.css is quite popular
[16:56:26] <Ou42> http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp
[16:56:29] <phpcoder> NoiseEee, THANK YOU!!
[16:56:37] * Ou42 trying to look all helpful ( at the last minute )
[16:57:28] <Ou42> don't tell anybody, but robert was right. go figure. $("table").table().table("refresh"); wasn't necessary... all i needed was, $("table").table();
[16:58:05] <Ou42> but it was the whole, "I need to refresh the table" search that lead me to go from $("table").table("refresh"); to $("table").table().table("refresh"); when I really only needed $("table").table("refresh");
[16:58:31] <Ou42> of the 3 the first one does not work. the 2nd is what i found, and the 3rd is what rob pointed out as being sufficient
[16:59:21] <Ou42> NoiseEee, do you use git?
[16:59:32] <NoiseEee> for version control, yes Ou42
[16:59:55] <Ou42> are you on a big project and/or do you use it for personal (non-team) stuff?
[17:00:24] <NoiseEee> both really
[17:00:47] <Ou42> so, it'd be helpul to find past versions that had different functionality?
[17:01:45] <Ou42> I was trying to find the file with the local table ( non-ajax ) but couldn't rem the name of the file... was it fg-search.html? there are 17 BAK files...
[17:02:07] <NoiseEee> its 2015, there's no excuse for developing without version control :)
[17:02:13] <NoiseEee> fix that before we lurch into 2016
[17:02:16] <Ou42> yes there is
[17:02:18] <Ou42> FUD
[17:02:30] <Ou42> I'm dragging myself
[17:02:47] <Ou42> u recommend git for a noob like me?
[17:02:48] <NoiseEee> its a no brainer and very simple
[17:02:54] <NoiseEee> yes git is by far the easiest
[17:02:58] <NoiseEee> tons of support everywhere
[17:03:12] <Ou42> and it's local?
[17:03:22] <Ou42> i don't have to use github?
[17:04:18] <Ou42> or rather, does using github push web dev onto the web?
[17:05:01] <Ou42> I'm still not convinced by "cloud" based file storage... so i don't benefit from having one repository for my dev files. "have key drive will travel"
[17:06:40] <NoiseEee> correct you don't need to use github at all
[17:06:59] <NoiseEee> github is a code repository where you can share/collab using git
[17:07:29] <NoiseEee> you can just keep it local and never push it anywhere
[17:10:34] <Ou42> and do you dev on the road?
[17:10:42] <Calinou> there are alternatives to GitHub too
[17:10:43] <Calinou> like GitLab
[17:11:41] <NoiseEee> Ou42: sure? i tend to push my git repos to a VPS or otherwise
[17:11:47] <NoiseEee> but private of course
[17:12:00] <Ou42> virtual private server?
[17:12:47] <Ou42> Calinou: you prefer GitLab to GitHub?
[17:13:27] <Calinou> they have a similar feature set, but GitLab has less users
[17:13:31] <Calinou> you can self-host GitLab, unlike GitHub
[17:14:42] <Ou42> i took one seminar class on git/svn... dunno where my notes are... but i will look into tuts on git. TY both.
[17:25:24] <Matt___> Hey there people
[17:25:30] <Matt___> anything wrong with this code?         if( $("input#username, input#new_password, input#password_confirm, input#password").val().length === 0 ) {         $("input[type='submit]").prop("disabled", true);     } else {         $("input[type='submit]").prop("disabled", false);     }
[17:29:29] <shoky> .val() only gets the first element's value
[17:37:07] <manners13> hey guys can anyone help or point me in the right direction of how to adjust this upload script to display an upload progess bar
[17:37:13] <manners13> https://jsfiddle.net/4x5b2jou/
[17:46:52] <Ou42> if you don't just want a "waiting" animation ( hourglass or the like ) and want a percentage complete meter, you'd need feedback from the server, no?
[17:47:36] <Ou42> or you could upload chunks at a time, so you'd have an idea of how much has been sent, but then you'd have to be able to merge those chunks serverside
[17:47:45] * Ou42 is a noob. take what he says with a grain of salt
[17:48:20] <Ou42> what's the smallest width to try to hit?
[17:48:27] <Ou42> as far a RWD goes?
[17:59:57] <Ou42> iPod touch 6th gen has: 1136-by-640-pixel resolution
[18:00:13] <Ou42> do you guys try to make your UI/UX fit that?
[18:03:33] <mikes000> depends on your audiance, but aim for it to work well on every screen size
[18:12:28] <Haydz> Hi, is it possible to use something like... if($('.element').is(':hover')) { } on content loaded VIA ajax?
[18:13:17] <Haydz> without using events :)
[18:48:53] <fas3r> does the selector "form :input" take also in consideration the textarea and checkbox ?
[18:51:28] <mikes000> https://api.jquery.com/input-selector/   "Selects all input, textarea, select and button elements."  from their example looks like checkbox is included
[18:52:18] <Ou42> mikes000 thanks!
[18:52:31] <Ou42> anybody heard of polymer?
[18:52:42] <Ou42> https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/
[18:54:04] <mikes000> looks pretty slick
[18:56:23] <qdk> Ou42: Do you have a real question or you writing a book about how popular polymer is?
[18:56:26] <z1haze> how would I select a inside of a link on the link click event
[18:56:41] <robertmaxrees> "a inside of a link"?  z1haze huh?
[18:57:00] <z1haze> i have an <a> with 2 spans that I need to animate when clicking the <a>
[18:57:08] <Ou42> qdk: that depends... do you want to co-author it? :p
[18:57:11] <z1haze> i have it working, but its animating every instance instead of the current
[18:57:13] <robertmaxrees> so a span inside of a link?
[18:57:16] <z1haze> yes
[18:57:19] <qdk> z1haze: child(ren) or something
[18:57:27] <Ou42> qdk: just heard about it. dunno much about anything. pretty much a jQ / jQM noob.
[18:57:34] <robertmaxrees> z1haze you need to look at the event object.
[18:57:36] <qdk> Ou42: no thanks.. no time. ;-)
[18:58:13] <qdk> Ou42: polymer has little to nothing to do with jquery.
[18:58:41] <robertmaxrees> what's going on here?
[18:59:03] <Ou42> robertmaxress: you were right.
[18:59:11] <robertmaxrees> as i usually am.
[18:59:15] <robertmaxrees> (about what?)
[18:59:19] <qdk> lol
[18:59:20] <Ou42> yes, but i'll never admit it
[18:59:54] <Ou42> "don't tell anybody, but robert was right. go figure. $("table").table().table("refresh"); wasn't necessary... all i needed was, $("table").table();"
[19:00:09] <Ou42> it took me a while to find the file... I've since been told to look into SVN. :p
[19:00:10] <robertmaxrees> hah
[19:00:22] <robertmaxrees> *git
[19:00:23] <robertmaxrees> and okay
[19:00:32] <qdk> z1haze: you could also give the spans a ID and target that in the click function... if you dont wanna "go from <a> (this) in the DOM"
[19:00:47] <robertmaxrees> z1haze i assume you want the specific span that was clicked, right?
[19:00:50] <Ou42> other than that, qdk has offered to co-author books as he has tons of free time and wants to give away his knowledge for free.
[19:00:55] <z1haze> i got it working, i didnt realize this clipboard.js have a event trigger you can use
[19:01:00] <robertmaxrees> z1haze awesome.
[19:01:22] <qdk> Ou42: :-)
[19:01:28] <Ou42> ;)
[19:02:20] <qdk> Ou42: Anyway material design is awesome and polymer is a nice implementation of it, by google, and doesnt require a framework behind it, if you just want to refresh a pages design.
[19:02:56] <qdk> Ou42: And you can always add some jquery goodiness to it as well. Its just "new" html tags.
[19:03:21] <Ou42> so, like angular?
[19:03:25] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:03:30] <robertmaxrees> angular is an MV* framework.
[19:03:32] <Ou42> I get a lot of that. stop that.
[19:03:35] <robertmaxrees> polymer is basically webcomponents
[19:03:51] <qdk> Ou42: Angular made their own implementation... or working on it at least.
[19:04:04] <robertmaxrees> sort of, but angular the project is more about MV*
[19:04:14] <Ou42> model view * ?
[19:04:18] <robertmaxrees> si
[19:04:18] <qdk> (at least for ng2.. which is what im "waiting for")
[19:04:35] <Ou42> "not ready for production"
[19:04:38] <robertmaxrees> or just use react and get a usable framework for today.
[19:04:45] <Ou42> too many techs
[19:04:52] <Ou42> i wanted js only... but i'm using jQ / jQM
[19:04:53] <qdk> Ou42: You dont know the MVC architecture?
[19:05:04] <robertmaxrees> jq IS js.
[19:05:04] <Ou42> not really. no. just heard about it
[19:05:05] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[19:05:31] <Ou42> rmr: jQ may be JS under the hood, but it took me a while to get past $
[19:05:33] <Ou42> :p
[19:05:42] <qdk> robertmaxrees: Not af fan of react, it looks weird and its not a full framework... If i would go with less I would probably go with Vue.
[19:06:02] <robertmaxrees> qdk i actually love react.  it solves a particular problem and does it very well.
[19:06:11] <robertmaxrees> fully composable templating is beautiful.
[19:06:44] <robertmaxrees> part of what I liked about the play framework.
[19:06:57] <qdk> robertmaxrees: And I would go all-in on typescript (ES2016 + types) and never look back at ES5.
[19:07:03] <Ou42> is there a page that describes all the "Recent" tech's and compare/contrasts them? react, jq, jqm, angular, ember, vue, bootstrap, node, polymer, etc?
[19:07:14] <robertmaxrees> i know what typescript is.  not really stoked on it tbh.,
[19:07:24] <robertmaxrees> Ou42 not really. some of those aren't really "recent".
[19:07:34] <Ou42> time is relative!
[19:07:36] <Ou42> :p
[19:07:37] <qdk> Ou42: Well its quite a mix you have going there
[19:07:59] <robertmaxrees> Ou42 you really need to start with fundamentals first.
[19:08:03] <Ou42> so are there pages... for each subset?
[19:08:05] <robertmaxrees> what problems do those solve.
[19:08:15] <robertmaxrees> there are comparisons for all of those.
[19:08:21] <Ou42> rather than go to each page and read, "ours is better"... an actual comparision of what each does "better" in what "case"?
[19:08:27] <qdk> Ou42: But yes, there is a great article somewhere I forgot... comparing a lot of JS front end frameworks.. (which node is not)
[19:08:35] <robertmaxrees> but many of them won't be meaningful if you don't, for instance, understand MVC
[19:09:20] <Ou42> but MVC is still a bit overkill for what i'm currently doing, right? is MVC for front end devs or back end devs?
[19:09:35] <robertmaxrees> wrong way to think about it.
[19:09:40] <robertmaxrees> it's a pattern.
[19:09:43] <mikes000> Can be for both depending on what you want to accomplish :D
[19:09:45] <qdk> Ou42: You can come a long way with "just" vanilla js (for you own sanity go ES2016 or typescript) + jquery + js component of the day for the task at hand.
[19:10:00] <robertmaxrees> i disagree with that sanity statement.
[19:10:13] <robertmaxrees> ES5 is awesome - 6 brought some really funky features with with./
[19:10:16] <robertmaxrees> *with it
[19:10:47] <mikes000> Just learned about call, apply, and bind...  life changing!
[19:11:03] <robertmaxrees> yep.  understanding function context is powerful.
[19:11:07] <qdk> robertmaxrees: I wanna kill myself with all those functions, prototype and shit... Classes are so much easier to read and work with... and with let you clean some bugs from day one.... And with types, even more.
[19:11:22] <robertmaxrees> qdk except JS still doesn't actually have classes ;)
[19:11:32] <robertmaxrees> it's just syntactic sugar for constructors.
[19:12:02] <qdk> robertmaxrees: I know, bit I can reuse my state of mind from other languages... instead of wanting to kill stuff and ppl doing ES5.
[19:12:09] <robertmaxrees> though i agree types would be nice, there are some simple things we do at my workplace that makes that a little less difficult.
[19:12:10] <qdk> but*
[19:12:28] <robertmaxrees> heh, except js is still different.
[19:12:36] <robertmaxrees> so your mental model wouldn't make much sense ;)
[19:12:54] <qdk> robertmaxrees: Well good coding conventions beats everything.
[19:13:07] <robertmaxrees> exactly.  i've seen lots of garbage ES6 flying around.
[19:13:32] <robertmaxrees> just because we have fat arrows doesn't mean you need to use them all the time.
[19:13:37] <narwaly> hi
[19:13:44] <qdk> robertmaxrees: Well I dont have to fight with ES6+ to structure my data and methods.
[19:13:53] <robertmaxrees> i don't have to fight with ES5 to do that.
[19:14:00] <narwaly> How can I open a link to different window
[19:14:04] <qdk> robertmaxrees: My mind is... a lot. :-)
[19:14:09] <robertmaxrees> qdk that's weird.
[19:14:13] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[19:14:19] <qdk> narwaly: target=_blank ?
[19:14:22] <narwaly> like target = "_blank" opens in a new tab
[19:14:30] <robertmaxrees> narwaly you can't.
[19:14:38] <narwaly> really
[19:14:40] <robertmaxrees> it's up to the browser how to determine what to do with new windows.
[19:14:49] <robertmaxrees> the user can configer a new window vs a new tab.
[19:14:55] <narwaly> not even a pop up
[19:14:59] <robertmaxrees> you can do popup windows, but you have to be careful about how you implement them.
[19:15:04] <robertmaxrees> and users may/may not see them.
[19:15:08] <robertmaxrees> use a modal instead.
[19:15:17] <qdk> modal++
[19:17:08] <robertmaxrees> boom.
[19:17:32] <robertmaxrees> goddamn new relic's latest update is awesome.
[19:21:39] <Ou42> robertmaxrees: you mean, http://newrelic.com/nodejs ?
[19:21:41] <realityloop> Hi, I'm trying to make the browser scroll to the top when a link is clicked, working fine on desktop with the following, but not working on mobile safari, can anyone point me to a method that will work?: $('html, body').stop(true).animate({scrollTop: 0}, 0);
[19:22:17] <robertmaxrees> Ou42 we use it with a few different stacks, but yeah.
[19:22:40] <robertmaxrees> realityloop you can do that without any js at all.
[19:23:03] <realityloop> robertmaxrees: I can?
[19:23:08] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:23:18] <robertmaxrees> page anchors
[19:23:51] <realityloop> robertmaxrees: ah, the part being clicked triggers the display of the mobile menu as well though.. so I don't think that would work..
[19:23:59] <robertmaxrees> it can do both.
[19:24:08] <robertmaxrees> give your top nav or whatever an ID, then give the link an href=#thatId
[19:24:16] <robertmaxrees> unless you're running preventDefault() on that link.
[19:24:21] <robertmaxrees> in which case, well, don't do that.
[19:25:43] <realityloop> robertmaxrees: looking
[19:25:49] <huck5> I have a select list, from which I need to get the selected element. However, the selected <option> does not get updated with ":select". Any ideas how to accomplish this?
[19:26:00] <robertmaxrees> huck5 why do you need the selected element?
[19:26:03] <robertmaxrees> do you want the value?
[19:26:15] <huck5> I need to hide a div based on the "placeholder" (first option in list) being selected.
[19:26:30] <robertmaxrees> use a data attribute for that instead.
[19:26:45] <huck5> add a data-attribute to the <options> ?
[19:27:04] <huck5> I'm currently working on an existing project, and want to modify as little of the existing code structure as possible...
[19:27:05] <robertmaxrees> to the select.
[19:27:24] <robertmaxrees> it's a big pain in the ass otherwise.
[19:27:48] <huck5> OK, could you give me an example of what the data-attribute would contain, or how it this might look?
[19:27:57] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle of your current select.
[19:28:04] <huck5> one moment please
[19:29:36] <robertmaxrees> NO.  IMMEDIATELY.
[19:29:37] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:31:29] <huck5> robertmaxrees,  something like this http://jsfiddle.net/33b38j3n/ :P
[19:31:48] <robertmaxrees> so whats the relationship here?
[19:32:04] <robertmaxrees> you said the first option contains some kind of context?
[19:32:18] <huck5> Well, the first option (-1) is basically a placeholder.
[19:32:50] <huck5> I'm used to seeing select-list's options havinga "select" attribute when selected. For some reason this one does not... as such I'm finding it difficult to establish which option is selected.
[19:33:06] <robertmaxrees> you can get the selected one by using the .val()
[19:33:10] * huck5 facepalm
[19:33:16] <huck5> beautiful robertmaxrees , saved me again =D
[19:33:45] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/33b38j3n/1/
[19:35:48] <lianzinho> how to get the child selector of the .on method?
[19:36:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:36:09] <lianzinho> i mean, something like that: $('body').on('load','[data-toggle="popover"]',function(){  $('[data-toggle="popover"]').popover(); });
[19:36:22] <robertmaxrees> you mean the thing that was clicked?
[19:37:00] <robertmaxrees> lianzinho you mean the specific toggle that was clicked?
[19:37:13] <lianzinho> yes
[19:37:19] <robertmaxrees> $(this)
[19:37:27] <robertmaxrees> also - don't select using data attributes basically ever.
[19:37:29] <robertmaxrees> give them a class instead.
[19:37:29] <lianzinho> $(this) in this case is body
[19:37:34] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:37:38] <robertmaxrees> $(this) will be the thing that was clicked.
[19:37:51] <robertmaxrees> oh - the load event doens't bubble.
[19:38:21] <robertmaxrees> so you can't use a delegated listener.
[19:39:12] <lianzinho> well
[19:39:23] <lianzinho> see if you could help me then..
[19:39:27] <lianzinho> I have this element
[19:39:38] <robertmaxrees> try making a singular problem statement :)
[19:39:38] <lianzinho> which is being created by javascript itself
[19:39:50] <robertmaxrees> and maybe make a fiddle.
[19:40:32] <lianzinho> so, i have to bind an event to it by using a delegated...
[19:40:42] <realityloop> robertmaxrees: linking to ID isn't working for some reason..
[19:41:03] <robertmaxrees> realityloop show me :)
[19:41:08] <lianzinho> but I don’t know exactly on which event I must bind
[19:41:12] <realityloop> rominronin: pm?
[19:41:29] <robertmaxrees> realityloop bad autocomplete, and please don't :)
[19:41:39] <robertmaxrees> lianzinho so you need to do something after you created an element?
[19:41:58] <lianzinho> yeah… that’s why I must use a delegated
[19:42:08] <robertmaxrees> you're confused about delegation and when you use it.
[19:42:14] <robertmaxrees> and events.
[19:42:19] <realityloop> robertmaxrees: I can't send it publicly atm, as site isn't live yet..
[19:42:20] <robertmaxrees> this is not an appropriate use case for an event listener.
[19:42:21] <lianzinho> but it cannot be on click, because I muse initialize it first
[19:42:27] <robertmaxrees> realityloop then make a simplified fiddle.
[19:42:43] <robertmaxrees> lianzinho you're conflating this - just run the init after you create the element.
[19:44:19] <robertmaxrees> lianzinho there's no event for when an element is created, so you're going down a path that doesn't make sense in the first place.
[19:44:44] <lianzinho> robertmaxrees: well.. it strangely worked…
[19:44:58] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make sense - i'd have to see it.
[19:45:48] <lianzinho> my concert was… sometimes, when an element is created dinamically it appears without the bound events, so you have to delegate… isn’t that right?
[19:46:14] <robertmaxrees> that's not exactly how it works.
[19:46:28] <robertmaxrees> and load isn't the correct event in this case.
[19:47:10] <robertmaxrees> like, your head is in the right place as far as wanting to use delegation for dynamically created events.  this is just an inappropriate use case for events.
[19:54:58] <Ou42> 43 - 1. i got it
[19:55:01] <Ou42> :p
[20:03:17] <ussher_> I have a function that ends up calling window.location.  it gets passed in the URL to go to like this onclick="GoToURL('http://somewhere.com')".  Is there a way inside that function to know if the CTRL key was pressed, or do I need to pass in the event with the URL?
[20:03:41] <robertmaxrees> you should use an event binding first.
[20:04:39] <ussher_> no other way then?  hoping to avoid it because that function is used in a ton of places and would rather not have to update them all.
[20:04:50] <robertmaxrees> Woah.
[20:04:55] <ussher_> yeah.
[20:05:00] <robertmaxrees> this is exactly why you use something like .on() in the first place.
[20:05:08] <robertmaxrees> i'd do a wholesale find and replace.
[20:05:25] <robertmaxrees> it'll be worth the extra time in the long run.
[20:05:43] <ussher_> thanks
[20:08:09] <Ou42> robertmaxrees: (or is it rominronin ?): is the lynda.com vid, "The MVC mindset ASP.NET MVC 5: The MVC mindset" a good starting place?
[20:08:20] <robertmaxrees> Ou42 not at all.
[20:08:33] <robertmaxrees> ASP.NET is a platform.
[20:08:38] <Ou42> stop being negative. :p
[20:08:40] <robertmaxrees> MVC is a convention.
[20:08:52] <Ou42> but it's the first vid in the series.
[20:08:55] <Ou42> ;)
[20:09:02] <robertmaxrees> hurr hurr
[20:09:20] <Ou42> and it's less than 10 minutes!
[20:09:27] <robertmaxrees> and it not what you want!
[20:09:29] <Ou42> it also regrows hair
[20:09:38] <robertmaxrees> but hey, keep belaboring the point.
[20:09:55] <Ou42> well, i've got access to lynda.com thought i'd try it out
[20:10:04] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't spend much time on it.
[20:10:16] <robertmaxrees> you can get all that information for free.
[20:10:37] <Ou42> info overload isn't free.
[20:10:45] <Ou42> and your tax dollars are paying for it
[20:10:58] <robertmaxrees> you just like having a snappy comeback for literally anything anybody says, don't you? ;)
[20:11:17] <Ou42> ty tyvm. uh, no?
[20:12:04] <Ou42> it's just too much. there's gotta be a sane way to deal with all this.
[20:12:13] <robertmaxrees> learn one thing at a time.
[20:12:19] <Ou42> and i obviously am not the person to make that decision.
[20:12:21] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to learn ALL OF DEVELPMENT at once.
[20:12:26] <robertmaxrees> actually, you are!
[20:12:34] * Ou42 looks around
[20:12:45] <Ou42> i don't think we're talking about the same person.
[20:12:46] <robertmaxrees> you're just making it harder than it needs to be.
[20:12:52] <robertmaxrees> what's your end goal?
[20:12:52] <Ou42> agreed
[20:12:58] <Ou42> employment
[20:13:07] <Ou42> support the fam
[20:13:19] <Ou42> make 'em proud
[20:13:25] <robertmaxrees> what sort of skillset to you have right now?
[20:13:42] <robertmaxrees> are you a complete beginner?
[20:13:56] <Ou42> everytime i think i've learned something it's proven i know very little. hard to answer. i sometimes feel i'm not but goto start
[20:14:12] <robertmaxrees> let's change the question then: how long have you been learning.
[20:14:24] <Ou42> decades
[20:14:36] <Ou42> but it's been shotgun approach
[20:14:49] <Ou42> as you said, trying to sip water from a fire hose
[20:14:59] <robertmaxrees> that's not good information.
[20:15:18] <robertmaxrees> you know what i'm asking, right?
[20:15:36] <robertmaxrees> what kind of experience do you have?  how long have you been seriously pursuing development?
[20:15:57] <Ou42> you want me to list a bunch of acronyms, but even if I do, my understanding of them is basic at best.
[20:16:03] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[20:16:06] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i'm asking at all.
[20:16:18] <robertmaxrees> you're presuming quite a bit.
[20:16:43] <Ou42> ok
[20:17:03] <Ou42> it's hard to ans your q. i know a little about a few things.
[20:17:05] <robertmaxrees> "i've been seriously pursuing this for about 5 months - i could probably build an entire web page by myself"
[20:17:16] <robertmaxrees> "i've used jquery and bootstrap.
[20:17:18] <robertmaxrees> "
[20:17:46] <Ou42> that's still too vague IMHO. I've started learning JQM for about a month
[20:17:53] <robertmaxrees> that's not vague at all.
[20:18:05] <robertmaxrees> you're not the one asking the question ;)
[20:18:54] <Ou42> define skillset
[20:19:15] <robertmaxrees> you been learning jqm for about a month.  what have you built?
[20:19:43] <Ou42> a Cordova based app that is a WIP
[20:20:02] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so you're using this project as a place to start learning i assume?
[20:20:03] <Ou42> and I have a Roku app that is also a WIP
[20:20:29] <Ou42> yes, the whole "bit off waaay more than I thought" issue was to learn Android dev w/o going native
[20:21:11] <robertmaxrees> so your real end goal is to do android app development?
[20:21:59] <Ou42> honestly? not really. maybe. I'm trying to finish projects to demonstrate I can do stuff.
[20:22:16] <robertmaxrees> so that's your first base problem.
[20:22:26] <robertmaxrees> you need to figure out what kind of focus you'd like to have.
[20:22:27] <Ou42> if it ends up being Android dev sobeit. but Cordova can output to other platforms. it's JS based.
[20:22:36] <robertmaxrees> i know what cordova is.
[20:22:44] <robertmaxrees> and it's sort of something a lot of people avoid.
[20:22:45] <Ou42> ;)
[20:22:53] <Ou42> but not everybody
[20:23:14] <robertmaxrees> you should really focus on learning web development or android app development.
[20:23:15] <Ou42> Roku with it's million+ devices isn't exactly "the market" either.
[20:23:37] <robertmaxrees> because right now you're basically making things way hard on yourself.
[20:24:01] <robertmaxrees> instead of learning one or the other, you're learning both.
[20:24:17] <Ou42> yes, and this started by tacking on a 3rd or 4th.
[20:24:30] <robertmaxrees> errr, just a 2nd.
[20:24:39] <Ou42> so, how to pick/choose the one with the best ROI?
[20:25:12] <Ou42> demonstrating "web dev" seems too vast to me. How does one "break in" / demo their "skillset"?
[20:25:15] <robertmaxrees> errr, you're too far out for that kind of question.
[20:25:23] <neredsenvy> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4a08c7f4e8bd1c580239 Someone able to help me with this. Is there a less intensive way I can write my loop ?
[20:25:25] <robertmaxrees> as least the ROI question.
[20:25:29] <SirLagz> Ou42: build some websites
[20:25:39] <robertmaxrees> Ou42 you build sites, widgets, components, etc.
[20:25:45] <robertmaxrees> build a full webapp.
[20:25:50] <robertmaxrees> the platform doesn't really matter.
[20:25:50] <Ou42> SirLagz: OK, but to what end?
[20:25:57] <robertmaxrees> Ou42 to learn.
[20:26:02] <robertmaxrees> and then you keep building them.
[20:26:06] <robertmaxrees> that's how you get the gig.
[20:26:24] <SirLagz> Ou42: build something you think you would use. doesn't matter if you end up using it or not, or if you finish it, the learning is what is important
[20:26:25] <Ou42> robertmaxrees: no, what must be shown on the website? what exactly can someone outside of the box do to impress those on the inside?
[20:26:38] <robertmaxrees> Ou42 nothing with where you're at.
[20:26:41] <SirLagz> Ou42: building it for yourself also means that you can see what usability mistakes you make
[20:26:57] <neredsenvy> .prev() is what I'm most concerned about seems like it would be an expansive operation as my forms grow
[20:27:00] <robertmaxrees> you wouldn't even get an interview right now.  so focus less on marketability and more on just building skills.
[20:27:54] <robertmaxrees> neredsenvy so you want all inputs with an error on them display some css?
[20:29:01] <robertmaxrees> 'cause i wouldn't use each at all. i'd use .filter() on the form groups./
[20:29:46] <phelix> if I had a div like <div class="divClass"></div> and I wanted to insert some custom html inside this element. What jquery function does this?
[20:29:54] <robertmaxrees> .append
[20:30:18] <phelix> perfect thanks
[20:30:59] <robertmaxrees> quick google search.
[20:31:21] <robertmaxrees> neredsenvy https://bpaste.net/show/9d79536277c5
[20:31:26] <Ou42> when you guys say "web apps" you mean using different web api and making a mashup?
[20:31:34] <robertmaxrees> nop.
[20:31:51] <robertmaxrees> *nope - we mean an application that happens to use a website as its frontend.
[20:32:38] <neredsenvy> Well each form-group will have a div.errors if there was an error for that input div.errors will contain text if it does I want to color the input field red
[20:32:40] <neredsenvy> well it's border
[20:32:52] <robertmaxrees> neredsenvy look at that link.,
[20:33:07] <neredsenvy> the method I have works but feels intensive since I first find the element and then go back the tree i think that's the expansive part
[20:34:34] <neredsenvy> thanks
[20:34:42] <mikes000> Could you do $('.error').parents('.form-group').css( blahhh blah blah )  ?
[20:34:52] <robertmaxrees> .closest(), and you could.
[20:34:57] <robertmaxrees> but that's a little wonky imo.
[20:36:15] <SirLagz> Ou42: think of an application you normally use on your computer....a web app would be that application, but in a web browser
[20:36:19] <SirLagz> Ou42: Google Docs for example
[20:36:57] <neredsenvy> robertmaxrees, it does not apply the css style tho
[20:37:03] <Ou42> first off thank you robertmaxrees & SirLagz . 2ndly, pls try to accept this as I"m really saying this as humbly as I can... Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
[20:37:05] <robertmaxrees> neredsenvy it should.
[20:37:32] <SirLagz> Ou42: or you could make something simple like a 'notepad' web-app of sorts to begin with
[20:37:40] <Ou42> robertmaxrees: SirLagz : it seems like, I must prove I'm able to do "more" than "entry level" to get an "entry level" job.
[20:37:52] <robertmaxrees> Ou42 that means you don't understand what entry level means.
[20:38:13] <Ou42> I'd be competing with col grads taht have no xp
[20:38:21] <robertmaxrees> they have a degree though.
[20:38:32] <robertmaxrees> they've got the 5 year equivalency.
[20:38:37] <Ou42> I don't know, but last I checked they wouldn't know all the acronyms either.
[20:38:46] <robertmaxrees> stop talking about acronyms.
[20:39:07] <Ou42> before i stop that ( is ng2 == angular 2 )?
[20:39:12] <robertmaxrees> yes
[20:39:19] <robertmaxrees> neredsenvy i misspelled "errors"
[20:39:19] <Ou42> whew.
[20:39:23] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lrh5cfj5/
[20:39:40] <robertmaxrees> Ou42 you're basically approaching this completely wrong.
[20:39:47] <robertmaxrees> you need skills - demonstrable skills.
[20:39:49] <Ou42> that's why i'm here....
[20:39:58] <Ou42> and trying not to annoy y'all. :p
[20:39:59] <SirLagz> best way to demonstrate is to do
[20:40:06] <robertmaxrees> being in here doesn't give you skills. building things does.
[20:40:35] <mikes000> get a github acocunt, start building things, anything. prove to a company that you can solve problems and learn things
[20:40:36] <Ou42> right, but i'm building the wrong things. maybe.
[20:40:52] <robertmaxrees> not the wrong things.  you're doing too much.
[20:40:54] <robertmaxrees> start simple.
[20:40:59] <neredsenvy> ahh works now
[20:41:02] <neredsenvy> thanks a lot mate
[20:41:03] <robertmaxrees> and progressively build your skills.
[20:43:51] * Ou42 is thinking
[20:44:11] <robertmaxrees> cordova is great when you know web development and then want to build an android app.
[20:44:11] <Ou42> someone mentioned "notepad" but using the browser... so like make "paint" ?
[20:44:20] <robertmaxrees> like notepad.
[20:44:24] <robertmaxrees> not paint.
[20:44:37] <SirLagz> Ou42: build something where you can save and load text blobs.
[20:45:04] <Ou42> so it's OK to reinvent the wheel for the demo's?
[20:45:05] <SirLagz> Ou42: start simple
[20:45:08] <robertmaxrees> where would you get the pain thing?
[20:45:13] <robertmaxrees> and Ou42 this will not get you a job.
[20:45:20] <robertmaxrees> you need focus on getting skills right now.
[20:45:23] <robertmaxrees> there's no shortcut here.
[20:45:23] <mikes000> Build a picture slider using only core jquery stuff. Don't use some premade pluggin
[20:45:26] <Ou42> paint not pain
[20:45:33] <Ou42> although the process is painful
[20:45:41] <SirLagz> Ou42: what process?
[20:45:41] <robertmaxrees> Ou42 i meant paint.
[20:45:50] <SirLagz> Ou42: the learning process?
[20:45:54] <robertmaxrees> there's no "build x thingx and you'll get a job"
[20:45:58] <robertmaxrees> if that's what you're expecing.
[20:46:09] <Ou42> i made a picture carousel in brightscript ( no api for it ) taht works as a menu!
[20:46:23] <Ou42> fake 3d and all.
[20:46:23] <robertmaxrees> err, there IS an api ;)
[20:46:27] <robertmaxrees> you used an interface.
[20:46:53] <Ou42> no css / js "animation" api. :p
[20:46:54] <SirLagz> this reminds me of when I built a paint clone in a webpage in plain ol' javascript years back lol...very very low res paint clone
[20:47:35] <robertmaxrees> Ou42 so anyway, stop thinking "if i build x, will i get hired?"
[20:47:47] <robertmaxrees> instead say "i should build x to learn." then add features.
[20:48:01] <mikes000> if you see something cool on the web, try to re-create it from scratch. It is all about practice
[20:48:09] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[20:48:10] <SirLagz> mikes000: took the words right out of my...handS?
[20:48:26] <Ou42> OK. and if i go with trying to "finish" the 2 apps... is it OK to release them as beta?
[20:48:28] <robertmaxrees> Ou42 you mentioned needing a job - you realize you won't get one for a few years, right?
[20:48:30] <mikes000> might be done by others 10000s of times by others, but it hasnt been done by YOU :D
[20:49:04] <robertmaxrees> and sure, release them.  don't expect them to be big sucesses though.
[20:49:14] <Ou42> wasn't planning on selling them.
[20:49:24] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with success.
[20:49:27] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[20:49:33] <mikes000> but they will look great when applying somewhere, expecially if you have a bunch that have progressed in quality over time
[20:49:38] <robertmaxrees> ^
[20:49:43] <Ou42> again, ties into what y'all are saying. was told (before) to do projects, make a website, demo the projects on teh website
[20:49:49] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[20:49:58] <robertmaxrees> but start small.
[20:50:03] <robertmaxrees> don't jump in to cordova.
[20:50:06] <robertmaxrees> build a webapp first.
[20:50:24] <robertmaxrees> hell, have your first webapp be a basic CMS that you then use for your site.
[20:50:29] <Ou42> i obviously have no concept of small. The cordova website port was supposed to be a tiny break from the Roku app
[20:50:41] <robertmaxrees> or do what lots of poeple do and focus on "wordpress development"
[20:50:44] <mikes000> could be even simple web app where you submit a form, and it adds a comment to a website
[20:50:49] <SirLagz> that's a good idea. Build your own CMS
[20:50:58] <SirLagz> I did that back when I was first starting web dev
[20:51:07] <robertmaxrees> like 95% of all projects are CRUDs anyway.
[20:51:15] <SirLagz> just with a fancy UI
[20:51:17] <Ou42> Content Mngment Sys?
[20:51:20] <SirLagz> Ou42: yes
[20:51:24] <Ou42> what's a CRUD?
[20:51:33] <robertmaxrees> Create, Read, Update, Destroy
[20:51:39] <robertmaxrees> basic db tasks.
[20:51:46] <SirLagz> heh, destroy
[20:51:55] <robertmaxrees> or delete.
[20:52:01] <robertmaxrees> depending on who you ask and how tired i am ;)
[20:52:10] <SirLagz> robertmaxrees: I like your definition better :D
[20:52:26] <robertmaxrees> even though you later learn to never actually do D
[20:52:35] <SirLagz> <-- learnt the hard way :D
[20:52:41] <robertmaxrees> we all did.
[20:52:44] <SirLagz> haha
[20:52:46] <robertmaxrees> active bits 4 lyfe
[20:53:19] <SirLagz> the only time to use delete is when you're retiring...and that's just deleting your resume :D
[20:55:03] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i go grab dinner and go home to relax.  enjoy folks.
[20:55:08] <SirLagz> robhol: see ya
[20:55:12] <SirLagz> er
[20:55:18] <SirLagz> oh
[20:55:42] * SirLagz stops ignoring nick changes
[20:56:37] <mikes000> i always imagine when someone says bye in irc and immediate leave them in real life start running away form you while saying their goodbye
[20:56:49] <Ou42> LOL
[20:56:52] <Ou42> he does leave fast
[20:56:59] <Ou42> maybe he's afraid he'll get too attached?
[20:57:13] <Ou42> hard to thank ppl that leave that fast.
[20:57:58] <Ou42> SirLagz: tyvm for your time & advice.
[20:58:06] <Ou42> mikes000: you too. tyvm.
[21:01:28] <SirLagz> Ou42: no problems
[21:02:05] <SirLagz> now I need to get some work done instead of following interesting IRC convos
[21:03:23] <mikes000> agreed! NP Ou42, now get out there and build yourself a something :D
[21:04:06] <Ou42> LOL
[21:33:41] <Ou42> TTFN, #jquery.
[21:33:53] * Ou42 pauses so as not to appear to be saying bye and running away at the same time...
[21:43:40] <EmmaBourbon> that was a very graceful exit.
[21:45:19] <EmmaBourbon> hi Nach0z
[21:45:58] <EmmaBourbon> hey BostonGeorge2k
[21:46:01] <EmmaBourbon> hey neilus
[21:50:11] <DjinnASD> how do i get test inside input box, change content of input box? http://jsfiddle.net/esmic/LGAWY/764/
[21:52:37] <ussher_> I'm trying to get window.location links to work the same way href="" links work when ctrl+click is used.  I'm close with window.open() but the focus will move to the just opened page.  any way to not focus on the new window?
[22:17:23] <esmic> is it not possible to change value of input box with content of fx span or div? http://jsfiddle.net/esmic/qy8kqdpx/
[22:20:34] <ussher_> esmic: maybe this http://jsfiddle.net/qy8kqdpx/1/
[22:27:12] <nights> hi
[22:27:31] <nights> if i get this as response from a POST: {"result_status":"ERROR","result_content":{"room_number":["Room number cannot be blank."],"name":["Your name cannot be blank."],"phonenumber":["Phone number cannot be blank."]}}
[22:27:40] <nights> how do i loop through the result_content array?
[23:42:35] <mdev> $(document.body).on('click', '#my_table tbody tr', function(event) {
[23:42:48] <mdev> doing that to detect any clicks in the table to highlight later
[23:43:00] <mdev> anyway that works fine but my issue is one of td's has a button called action
[23:43:08] <mdev> and anytime I click it, it also fires off that tr click
[23:43:24] <mdev> any ideas how to cancel that? I tried setting a variable and check for it but not working
[23:54:05] <mdev> nevermind I got it worked out
