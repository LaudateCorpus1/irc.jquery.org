[00:21:13] <sunny_> http://jsfiddle.net/cwygfumo/1/
[00:21:18] <sunny_> hey anybody know how to make list element draggable
[00:21:43] <Uhkis> short term memory problems clearly
[00:25:09] <Cork> sunny_: you have answers, until you address the feedback you won't get more of them
[00:26:37] <sunny_> actually the code i send is correct but want to make it like https://2600hz.atlassian.net/wiki/display/docs/Callflows+and+Numbers
[00:26:46] <Cork> no it isn't
[00:27:27] <Cork> sunny_: stop arguing and fix the broken html
[00:28:15] <Uhkis> http://www.skidmore.edu/~pdwyer/e/eoc/help_vampire.htm
[00:29:34] <sunny_> CORK my html is not broken its work great actually if you want to make flow chart so have to give the id name same
[00:29:50] <sunny_> i want to make the call flow design
[00:29:55] <Cork> sunny_: good for you
[00:30:14] <Cork> if you know it works you should be able to get it working then
[00:31:35] <sunny_> no actually i want to know how can i make the draggable list droppable
[00:32:41] <Cork> you can't without fixing the broken code (that apparently isn't broken)
[00:32:51] <Cork> so you must know more about how to fix broken code then we do
[00:32:56] <Cork> so you can do it
[00:34:03] <sunny_> ok wait a minute a minute i will send u a link plz c heck it out https://2600hz.atlassian.net/wiki/display/docs/Callflows+and+Numbers

[00:34:44] <Cork> someone else might
[00:34:56] * Cork stops wasting time
[01:16:03] <john> hi anybody know that how to make specific list element  draggable
[01:16:08] <john> or droppable
[01:16:50] <jikuja> nice nick change
[01:17:00] <Uhkis> no one will ever notice!
[01:20:40] <john> IS there any possibilities to know that where a drop my list elements
[01:23:49] <Cork> john/sunny_: changing the nick won't release you of the need to fix the broken code
[01:37:15] <Solcero> hi, is it possible that when I use Jquery.noConfilct() the scripts much slower ?
[01:37:23] <Cork> no
[01:37:47] <Cork> all noConflict does is restore the window.$ variable back to what it was before jquery was loaded
[01:37:52] <Cork> there is no code cost in that
[01:38:03] <Solcero> ok thx
[01:38:06] <Cork> loading multiple frameworks on a page IS slowing it down though
[01:38:18] <Cork> (that page that is)
[02:20:17] <philip_b> hi! I'm using jquery via node, and it seems that $.Deferred is undefined. is there a nice workaround for that? using jquery in a unit test...

[02:33:47] <victor_> how to make specific list element droopable
[02:34:51] <HewloThere> Hi guys! Would you mind filling out a very quick multiple choice survey about development and programming? http://goo.gl/forms/R7NtyuVkBD Thanks to anyone who does!
[02:34:56] <philip_b> victor_: you mean draggable?
[02:35:08] <victor_> yes man
[02:35:20] <philip_b> ok ok ...
[02:35:41] <victor_> actuall i work on flow system
[02:35:43] <philip_b> looking at some code of mine with that stuff
[02:36:11] <victor_> you know that how to make specific list element draggable
[02:36:18] <abailarri> Hello. Anyone can help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/yxaectqv/1/  I not see the alerts
[02:37:05] <philip_b> in my code, I have a class .draggable. to it, I attach the events dragstart and dragend. if I remember correctly, this is how browsers determine it. btw, with some browsers it's easier to get started
[02:37:31] <victor_> oook
[02:37:35] <Uhkis> abailarri: typo on line 8
[02:38:05] <philip_b> this should get you started dragging, let me know when you want to start dropping ;)
[02:38:13] <victor_> Philip_b  can i send you my fiddle
[02:38:50] <abailarri> Uhkis, http://jsfiddle.net/yxaectqv/2/
[02:39:29] <philip_b> sorry, kind of busy... better to post it on stackoverflow.com with tags jquery and drop n drop
[02:40:10] <victor_> plz see it may its simple for you
[02:40:23] <philip_b> ok shoot :p
[02:40:27] <victor_> http://jsfiddle.net/cwygfumo/2/
[02:40:35] <victor_> here my fiddle
[02:41:34] <Katharsis> which plugin or library you can recommend me for lazy content loading?
[02:42:03] <victor_> i want after  drag  .  the element i dragged i want to make it droppable
[02:42:11] <philip_b> you must call $('#external-events  li').bind('dragstart', function() {...}). and bind('dragend', function() {...}) I think ;)
[02:42:38] <victor_> ok thank you so much
[02:43:26] <Uhkis> abailarri: http://jsfiddle.net/yxaectqv/4/
[02:43:47] <abailarri> Uhkis, what do you do?
[02:44:02] <philip_b> you're welcome ;)
[02:44:05] <Uhkis> abailarri: fixed selector and extra }
[02:48:55] <ravenzz> use on instead
[02:49:02] <ravenzz> bind's been deprecated
[02:49:50] <victor_> not actual i want
[02:49:55] <Cork> heh third times a charm i see
[02:51:04] <Uhkis> Cork: meaning third nick today?
[02:51:07] <Cork> ya
[02:51:18] <Uhkis> i recall 3 nicks on friday also
[02:51:45] <Cork> why fix your broken code, when all you need is to change the nick and reask the question to get som sucker to do it for you
[02:52:27] <Uhkis> exactly
[03:03:33] <juslintek> Hi everyone, how to make jquery-ui menu respond to url and keep submenus visible if they are in that area?
[03:04:40] <Cork> juslintek: if you use an url to reload the page the js is unloaded and you can't keep those states around
[03:10:15] <juslintek> Hi everyone, how to make jquery-ui menu respond to url and keep submenus visible if they are in that area?
[03:11:31] <juslintek> Cork, is there a possible method to save that, so I guess I should call a function on php load which generated menu and add specific class, which tell that submenu item to be displayed on load if target url matches href url.
[03:12:31] <juslintek> Or maybe pass it somehow via cookie?
[03:17:00] <Cork> juslintek: no
[03:17:16] <Cork> juslintek: you could grab info and push along with the request
[03:17:26] <Cork> or possibly store it locally in one of the database solutions
[04:21:31] <IzaacJ> I have some jQuery issues. On my WordPress plugin settings page, some options should be hidden depending on what is selected in a dropdown box, but I'm unable to get it to work. http://t.co/35eo5TGbVT
[04:21:42] <dieguezz> hi, i am using backbone and i having troubles to unbind an event. http://nopaste.info/01a1e30a9a.html for more info. Should i replace $(window).on with listenTo or something? With .off i am getting a zombie view
[04:21:51] <IzaacJ> The HTML is generated by the WordPress Settings API
[04:43:22] <dieguezz> any idea on why height in console.log from line 14 (offsetPlus) is not the same as height in css?
[04:46:26] <Oka> dieguezz: Can you relink what your having trouble with? I just got here.
[04:50:44] <Oka> s/your/you're Zzz.
[04:51:19] <IzaacJ> I've managed to do some corrections in my jQuery code. It fetches ALL .unique.selectable in the document, but I'm unable to do parentsUntil on the objects inside a jQuery.each(arr, function (i, val)), any idea how I make it possible to do parentsUntil on the val variable?
[04:53:00] <Cork> IzaacJ: why do you need parentsUntil?
[04:53:41] <Cork> IzaacJ: it should work fine on jquery inside a loop as long as you run it on a jquery object
[04:53:49] <Cork> (and no a raw dom element)
[04:53:51] <IzaacJ> Because I need to change the classes on the objects individual tr elements.
[04:54:17] <Cork> IzaacJ: and you're sure you don't meant to use .closest?
[04:54:42] <IzaacJ> Cork: here is the code, and the HTML http://pastebin.com/VXdmyqFe
[04:54:44] <Cork> *didn't mean
[04:55:45] <Cork> IzaacJ: so you want to add/remove the class on body td and tr?
[04:55:49] <Cork> ...
[04:55:51] <IzaacJ> yes
[04:55:52] <Cork> man i can't type
[04:55:55] <Cork> *both
[04:55:57] <Cork> ok
[04:56:18] <Cork> (the reason i asked i cause it is common for ppl to mix these things up)
[04:57:00] <Cork> IzaacJ: also just do $j(':not(.'+selecteddiv+').selectable').each(function() {});
[04:57:02] <IzaacJ> Cork: well, only tr is really needed
[04:57:14] <Cork> no need for the extra structure you have
[04:57:20] <Cork> also DEFINE YOUR VARIABLES!
[04:57:53] <Cork> IzaacJ: then you could just do $(this).closest('tr').add/removeClass
[04:58:15] <Cork> IzaacJ: but ya, you really need to start defining your variables
[04:58:23] <Cork> almost all of them are globals
[05:00:44] <IzaacJ> Cork: I used closest, but I get that object val doesn't support closest
[05:02:28] <Cork> IzaacJ: http://jsfiddle.net/a2cz0zfa/
[05:02:49] <Cork> opps
[05:02:58] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/a2cz0zfa/1/
[05:03:05] <Cork> removed missed semicolon
[05:03:47] <Cork> IzaacJ: note that i redeclared the $ in the ready call
[05:04:00] <Cork> so you don't have to sprinkle $j around in the code
[05:07:26] <IzaacJ> Cork: Thanks :D Haven't done much jQuery, or JS before :P
[05:08:54] <dieguezz> Oka http://jsfiddle.net/dieguezz/jhb9de4z/2/ sorry i was busy :D
[05:09:16] <Oka> dieguezz: No worries.
[05:10:13] <victor_> how can i make the draggable list to droppable
[05:10:24] <Cork> ...
[05:10:35] <Cork> 4'th...
[05:12:17] <victor_>  i am new in this so i have a doubt solve it or not
[05:13:57] <Cork> victor_: start by listening to the help you've been given
[05:14:18] <victor_> ok
[05:14:26] <victor_> now you help
[05:14:44] <Cork> ok, start by fixing the broken html
[05:14:59] <victor_> yes fix my broken html
[05:15:17] <victor_> http://jsfiddle.net/cwygfumo/5/
[05:15:47] <Oka> Oh jeez, this again.
[05:15:51] <Cork> yup
[05:16:34] <Cork> would be nice if there was a channel mode "leach" you could put on a nick
[05:16:40] <Eels> victor_: What's with the random li ids?
[05:16:41] <Cork> so ppl know what nick to ignore
[05:16:43] <dieguezz> any idea on why height in console.log from line 14 (offsetPlus) is not the same as height in css? http://jsfiddle.net/dieguezz/jhb9de4z/2/ compare it with http://jsfiddle.net/dieguezz/jhb9de4z/1 (which is working fine)
[05:16:47] <Cork> Eels: don't bother
[05:17:55] <Cork> dieguezz: you most likely want outerHeight
[05:18:02] <victor_> leave the id name just see jquery functionallity
[05:20:00] <Eels> Would be good if you could tell us what exactly you want it to do.
[05:20:51] <Cork> Eels: he don't want to do anything, he want gratis developers, when he gets info about what is wrong he refuses to look at them
[05:21:07] <Cork> so seriusly, don't feed the leach
[05:21:34] <victor_> i want after one drag like  i drag the menu into droppable i want menu droppable that drop
[05:22:12] <victor_> cork  if you dont want to help then ok not an big deal ok
[05:22:32] <Cork> victor_: sure, but i will warn others to not waste there time too
[05:22:46] <Cork> until you respect he time ppl spend to help ppl
[05:23:04] <victor_> i dont want to want waste someone time
[05:23:09] <victor_> just want a answer
[05:23:10] <Cork> you do
[05:23:14] <victor_> yup
[05:23:23] <Cork> exactly
[05:24:38] <dieguezz> Ty Cork  that was it, but.. now i got the problem of.. when images are loaded. If i set min-height in css is great, but if not, i ahve no way of knowing real height (thinking on responsiveness)
[05:25:15] <Cork> dieguezz: not sure what you ask here
[05:27:50] <dieguezz> Cork,  i want to know when images are loaded. Because if i dont set min-height, then outerheight will be the outerheight of the dom, which is smaller than outerheight of the container with the images loaded
[05:28:13] <Cork> dieguezz: is the img inline in the html?
[05:29:08] <dieguezz> yes Cork like.. <img src="."...>
[05:29:13] <dieguezz> in the template
[05:29:25] <Cork> dieguezz: yes, but is it inline in the html
[05:29:26] <dieguezz> i was thinking on using this https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[05:29:31] <Cork> or are you dynamically adding them to the page?
[05:29:37] <dieguezz> nono, its inline
[05:29:48] <Cork> then it is harder
[05:30:01] <dieguezz> do u think that plugin will help Cork ?
[05:30:05] <Cork> cause it is racy to add load event handlers to inline img
[05:30:23] <Cork> this is what that plugin is bridges yes
[05:33:54] <Kartagis> what's the right way to  make some message disappear on click? set it to display:none?
[05:34:04] <Cork> .hide()
[05:34:14] <Cork> or .remove() if you don't want to show it again
[05:35:32] <Unopoo> I'm using jqueryui's .slider(), and I want the slider to animate smoothly when the slideshow advanced, I code as this:
[05:35:33] <Unopoo> $('#slider').slider( {animate: 'slow', value: $('#books li').index(this)} );
[05:35:33] <Unopoo> but seems the animate: 'slow' part not working, am I doing it wrong?
[05:37:20] <Cork> Unopoo: the animation is for ui, not the value setter
[05:37:29] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#option-animate
[05:37:37] <Cork> "Whether to slide the handle smoothly when the user clicks on the slider track""
[05:37:58] <Cork> specifically "clicks on the slider track"
[05:42:00] <Unopoo> what's a slide track? something like 'prev' and 'next'?
[05:44:30] <Kartagis> is $(".messages") sufficient for a div which is <div class="messages status"> ?
[05:57:54] <Cork> Kartagis: yes
[05:58:06] <Cork> or $('.status')
[05:58:15] <Cork> or $('.messages.status')
[05:58:25] <Cork> or $('.status.messages') :)
[06:03:00] * Kartagis hates minified, when there's no unminified
[06:06:26] <Cork> Kartagis: you can prettify the code
[06:06:34] <Cork> if the script isn't too big it is usually enough
[06:06:41] <Kartagis> Cork: how?
[06:06:50] <Cork> ?g prettify js
[06:06:52] <b-ot> Cork: Online JavaScript beautifier → http://jsbeautifier.org/
[06:07:25] <Cork> at least firefox has it built in too
[06:07:37] <Cork> not sure about chrome
[06:08:02] <no_gravity> hello! whats the preferred command in jquery to convert a string with html into a dom node?
[06:08:06] <Kartagis> I could write my code, minify it, and paste it there too
[06:08:14] <Kartagis> right?
[06:08:14] <Cork> no_gravity: $.parseHTML
[06:08:26] <Cork> if you want to be completely sure it always works
[06:08:32] <Cork> you can use $(string) too
[06:08:43] <Cork> but it can mistakenly take it for a selector at times
[06:09:07] <Cork> Kartagis: sure
[06:09:17] <no_gravity> Cork: awesome. let me try that...
[06:09:22] <Cork> Kartagis: basically it just adds line brakes and spaces in the compressed code
[06:14:01] <no_gravity> Cork: error "$.parseHTML is not a function"
[06:14:11] <Cork> what version of jquery?
[06:14:40] <Cork> cause this was split out of $ in 1.8
[06:14:40] <no_gravity> Cork: 1.7.1
[06:14:44] <Cork> ok :)
[06:14:49] <Cork> so just use $(string)
[06:14:55] <no_gravity> ok
[06:15:00] <Cork> (or update)
[06:16:03] <no_gravity> Cork: it looks like that gives me some weird object
[06:16:20] <Cork> no_gravity: it gives you a fragment wrapped in jquery
[06:16:29] <Cork> no_gravity: what are you trying to do?
[06:16:31] <Kartagis> heh, no wonder my code didn't work
[06:16:37] <Kartagis> live vs. on
[06:16:41] <Cork> ah
[06:19:56] <no_gravity> Cork: looks like it raises an error inside jquery
[06:20:06] <no_gravity> Cork: s="<div>hello</div>";e=$(s);console.log(e);
[06:20:41] <no_gravity> Cork: gives me this weird error: TypeError: Argument 1 of Node.appendChild does not implement interface Node.
[06:21:19] <no_gravity> oh, no it gives me the error on another line
[06:21:27] <no_gravity> but the console.log was before the error
[06:21:54] <no_gravity> so for some magic reason it first logs something weird to the console but only displays it later.
[06:22:01] <no_gravity> what the fuck...
[06:22:36] <no_gravity> anyhow, it seems to not create a dom element
[06:22:45] <dieguezz> hi, using backbone, should i remove an event handler like this? http://nopaste.info/01a1e30a9a.html line 7, instead of 6
[06:22:56] <no_gravity> Cork: do i have to extract the dom element from it?
[06:24:05] <DevAntoine> hi
[06:25:24] <DevAntoine> I'm preventing form submission to do some validation before. But how SexualRickshaw am I supposed to submit it after? Typicaly: $('form').submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); // do some check }); If I trigger submit after the checks are done it's like an infinite loop
[06:28:56] <Cork> no_gravity: it creates them, you can just $(target).append(result)
[06:29:04] <Cork> no_gravity: so again, what are you trying to do?
[06:29:48] <Cork> DevAntoine: this.submit()
[06:29:49] <no_gravity> Cork: got it, $("<div>hello</div>").get(0);
[06:30:09] <Cork> no_gravity: or just $("<div>hello</div>")[0]
[06:30:15] <no_gravity> Cork: ok
[06:30:17] <Cork> no_gravity: jquery is an array like object
[06:30:33] <Cork> so you can access each top level element through the array notation
[06:30:52] <DevAntoine> Cork: but then the submit event is fired again
[06:30:53] <Cork> no_gravity: though you often don't have to
[06:30:58] <Cork> DevAntoine: no
[06:31:13] <Cork> DevAntoine: notice the difference between $(this).submit() and this.submit()
[06:31:27] <DevAntoine> Cork: yes, jQuery object vs element
[06:31:37] <DevAntoine> but I thought the second one was fireing submit too
[06:31:40] <Cork> and the later doesn't retrigger the event
[06:31:41] <Cork> no
[06:31:46] <DevAntoine> funny
[06:31:48] <DevAntoine> thanks
[06:32:09] <Cork> DevAntoine: this is intentional dom behavior so you can script submit a form
[06:32:28] <Cork> jquery fake these things with .trigger()
[06:32:37] <Cork> and this especially for submit events
[06:32:46] <Cork> (and focus and blur)
[06:33:02] <DevAntoine> Cork: thanks for the input!
[07:39:11] <xec> is it just me or is the first paragraph at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools in vietnamese?

[07:40:17] <xec> i tried pasting it into google translate and it got detected as vietnamese, but doesn't make much sense
[07:41:20] <xec> also, selecting vietnamese as language on the same page does not return a page with the first paragraph in english (worth a shot i thought)

[09:13:20] <mcordingley> I'm running into something very odd and frustrating. I have event bindings on touch events that get get up on page `load`. After this page enters the bfcache, it seems as if those bindings are lost. So far, I haven't been able to turn up anything good on Google. Can someone help point me in the right direction?
[09:22:53] <cjohnson> ""after this page enters the bfcache" what?
[09:23:17] <cjohnson> if that means "after the elements are removed and re-added to the DOM" then yes that makes sense that the bindings are lost
[09:23:22] <cjohnson> if you want to keep them use event delegation
[09:30:34] <mcordingley> cjohnson: Isn't the point of bfcache to essentially "pause" the state of the page when the user navigates away? Why would elements be getting removed from the DOM in that case?
[09:30:50] <cjohnson> I have no idea what bfcache is
[09:31:09] <cjohnson> but if the user navigates away from the page, that would makese sense event bindings are lost
[09:31:12] <robertmaxrees> "back-forward cache"
[09:31:18] <cjohnson> they only last as long as the page exists
[09:31:48] <cjohnson> ah
[09:31:57] <mcordingley> Yeah
[09:32:05] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue?
[09:32:50] <robertmaxrees> because that's something you shouldn't need to mess with like ever
[09:32:52] <cjohnson> i've never experienced bindings being lost. either the code is re-executed and the bindings are re-set, or it's just loaded and the state of the code remains teh same. but I've never paid too much attention to it
[09:33:19] <mcordingley> I set up some touch bindings on page load to handle dragging a piece of DOM around. Basically, it's a touch-enhanced carousel. When I hit the page fresh, it works. When I follow a link and then go "back", it ceases to respond to input.
[09:33:38] <robertmaxrees> have any code you can share?
[09:34:58] <mcordingley> Sure. http://library.booksite.dev/js/bk-carousel.js Pardon the code style. I still need to "refactor" after getting "green light".
[09:35:38] <Eels> How would I be able to style the divs that appear when I click a map marker on http://joris.palings.be/ ? I'm particularly having trouble with the title div because Google Maps automatically styles it.
[09:36:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:36:33] <robertmaxrees> mcordingley i can't access that
[09:36:38] <robertmaxrees> looks like your local environent.
[09:36:55] <mcordingley> Ahem: library.booksite.com/js/bk-carousel.js
[09:37:29] <cjohnson> can you provide a page using that code to test?
[09:37:59] <robertmaxrees> why are you using $(window).load(function() { ?
[09:38:00] <mcordingley> http://library.booksite.com/4990/showdetail/?isbn=9780983334125&list=CNL1&cnlcode=CNL1&opacoption=OPAC_B&skin=6980
[09:38:18] <mcordingley> robertmaxrees: I need to wait until images have loaded to measure their width.
[09:38:43] <robertmaxrees> something smells here to me.
[09:38:47] <mcordingley> Normally, I'd just use `$(function() {});`
[09:39:21] <Eels> I've tried .addClass() but even with $(document).ready() it won't overwrite the default Google Maps style
[09:39:28] <robertmaxrees> also: why did you write your own carousel?
[09:39:32] <mcordingley> robertmaxrees: I'm sure. According to my understanding of how this is supposed to work, this should not be happening. Easiest explanation is that I'm doing something wrong.
[09:39:49] <mcordingley> robertmaxrees: Some project-specific requirements.
[09:39:56] <robertmaxrees> hrmmm.
[09:40:38] <robertmaxrees> have you tried moving the touch events to using the delegatex syntax for .on() ?
[09:41:12] <mcordingley> What would I delegate them under?
[09:41:23] <mcordingley> And how would that help?
[09:41:35] <Katharsis> hi
[09:41:39] <Katharsis> i got "This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS."
[09:41:48] <Katharsis> but my script used https when POST
[09:42:00] <Katharsis> moreover, script src has https too
[09:42:01] <Katharsis> wtf
[09:42:33] <robertmaxrees> mcordingley just tossing out ideas.  i'm not on a touch-enabled device and i'm dealing with the aftermath of a migraine so i'm fuzzy today
[09:42:50] <mcordingley> robertmaxrees: Oh man, you have my sympathies there.
[09:44:07] <robertmaxrees> either way, using window load tells me something else is up.  is there any way you can't add data attributes of the image dimansions instead?  Why do you need the image dimentions in the first place?
[09:44:08] <robertmaxrees> etc
[09:45:07] <mcordingley> robertmaxrees: I don't know the size of the images before they load. They're from an external source. All I get is their URL which I drop into the HTML from the server-side. Still, I don't see how "load" would be any different from "ready", except that it fires a bit later in the page life-cycle.
[09:45:43] <robertmaxrees> just tossing out ideas for things to try.
[09:45:48] <robertmaxrees> why do you need the image widths though?
[09:47:02] <mcordingley> Because I need to calculate and set the size of the container that they go into. And I need to do THAT because the container doesn't have an intrinsic width that I can access or set through CSS because this is a legacy codebase that uses tables for layout.
[09:47:28] <robertmaxrees> I'd consider setting a max-height on those images instead and letting the widths fall as they may
[09:47:33] <robertmaxrees> if the issue is predictability.
[09:47:38] <mcordingley> As in, OMG-ancient-legacy in places. :( That's one of the project-specific constraints that forced me to write one myself in the first place.
[09:48:13] <mcordingley> I still need to calculate the width of the container from the images, which means waiting until they load.
[09:48:24] <robertmaxrees> i wish i understood why, but ok.
[09:48:38] <mcordingley> Because there's no instrinsic width to a table cell.
[09:48:56] <mcordingley> I can't do width: 100% like I ought to be able to do.
[09:49:03] <robertmaxrees> and you're not able to modify the markup?
[09:49:27] <mcordingley> I can modify the markup for the carousel, but not for the surrounding HTML.
[09:50:10] <robertmaxrees> right.  so you have you container that it whatever width it needs to be, and then your images fall as they may.
[09:50:36] <robertmaxrees> but i could be crazy.  i feel like that window load is the culprit here.
[09:50:50] <robertmaxrees> or there's something else in your frontend codebase causing headaches.
[09:51:21] <mcordingley> Oh, there's plenty in the front and back that has caused me plenty of head-aches. ;) I'm trying to clean it up as I go, but there's only so much that can be done at a time.
[09:51:31] <robertmaxrees> i'm aware.
[09:51:43] <robertmaxrees> i work in a few legacy codebases, so I'm familiar with the pains.
[09:53:22] <mcordingley> I temporarily swapped it over to "ready" and the same issue is there.
[09:53:29] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[09:53:30] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[10:02:20] <drager> How would you guys solve long polling using php and javascript?
[10:02:41] <mcordingley> drager: Are you familiar with Ratchet?
[10:02:47] <cjohnson> sockets or similar
[10:03:08] <drager> mcordingley: Yeah, I used Ratchet for websockets
[10:03:10] <cjohnson> https://github.com/panique/php-long-polling
[10:04:47] <mcordingley> robertmaxrees: Any ideas on how I can debug this in the Android browser? If I could see what's going on, I could at least narrow down what's happening.
[10:05:09] <robertmaxrees> android or chrome?
[10:05:13] <mcordingley> Androis
[10:05:16] <robertmaxrees> hrmmm.
[10:05:16] <mcordingley> Android*
[10:05:34] <cjohnson> doesn't the new firefox have some remote debugger support for android?
[10:05:45] <robertmaxrees> that's not the same thing.
[10:05:45] <Prometheian> I think Firefox Developer Edition does.
[10:05:53] <cjohnson> what is it?
[10:06:05] <robertmaxrees> some phones have a shitty "android" browser.
[10:06:08] <robertmaxrees> that's not chrome or FF.
[10:06:15] <Prometheian> Old phones
[10:06:19] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[10:06:20] <Prometheian> New ones default to chrome
[10:06:24] <robertmaxrees> i'm aware
[10:06:32] <cjohnson> but it's the right use of debugger no?
[10:06:33] <robertmaxrees> i just got a new one late last week ;_)
[10:06:35] <cjohnson> just different browser
[10:06:40] <drager> mcordingley: I do not really know how to use long polling with Ratchet though…
[10:06:47] <cjohnson> it lets you use the whole dev tools thing remotely
[10:06:59] <robertmaxrees> cjohnson for some OS combos, yes.
[10:07:04] <cjohnson> cool
[10:07:09] <mcordingley> drager: I'm suggesting using websockets, and the appropriate PHP library for that, instead of long-polling.
[10:07:39] <Eels> How would I be able to style the divs that appear when I click a map marker on http://joris.palings.be/ ? I'm particularly having trouble with the title div because Google Maps automatically styles it.
[10:07:42] <Eels> I've tried .addClass() but even with $(document).ready() it won't overwrite the default Google Maps style
[10:07:44] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Valence this is the FF thing.
[10:07:47] <drager> mcordingley: I need to have long-polling as fallback if websockets is not present though.
[10:07:48] <mcordingley> drager: Since long-polling is more in the nature of a hack to do what Websockets do.
[10:08:12] <drager> Yeah, thats true
[10:08:22] <drager> But I do still need a fallback
[10:08:24] <cjohnson> if it's just a fallback, use the mess that is demonstrated in the github link I linked above
[10:08:37] <drager> cjohnson: Tried that, didnt work out so well :<
[10:08:40] <robertmaxrees> Eels through .map .infobar
[10:08:43] <drager> My server "hangs"
[10:08:44] <cjohnson> what about it drager
[10:08:53] <drager> or more like, not responding
[10:09:01] <Eels> So just in my CSS?
[10:09:01] <cjohnson> oh... well debug what's going on :P
[10:09:10] <drager> I have for along time :D
[10:09:11] <robertmaxrees> Eels yeah...
[10:09:18] <drager> Tried different teqniques
[10:09:22] <cjohnson> drager: well join the proper PHP channel and ask for help
[10:09:23] <drager> Cant spell
[10:09:25] <robertmaxrees> Eels some attributes aren't going to be easily modified though
[10:09:32] <drager> Tried that as well :<
[10:09:39] <Eels> But that'd style the entire thing, not just the innerHTML after you click a marker
[10:09:41] <cjohnson> and what, they told you to die in a fire?
[10:09:55] <drager> More or less
[10:10:01] <robertmaxrees> Eels what exactly are you trying to accomplish?  what are you styling, specifically?
[10:10:03] <drager> No but, use websockets and so on
[10:10:05] <drager> or use node
[10:10:08] <drager> which I cannot
[10:10:10] <drager> in this case
[10:10:14] <cjohnson> why not?
[10:10:32] <drager> School task to use php for backend and js frontend
[10:10:39] <drager> + all the other logic is in php
[10:10:48] <Eels> When you click a marker, two divs appear. The bottom one, the descriptions, is pretty modifiable, but the top div, the title, I can't seem to modify the font-size, for example
[10:10:49] <Prometheian> Oh dear god Internet Programming course stuck in the early 00's
[10:10:55] <cjohnson> drager: you can do web sockets in PHP
[10:11:02] <cjohnson> Ratchet
[10:11:05] <drager> cjohnson: Yeah, Im using it
[10:11:07] <drager> for websockets
[10:11:10] <cjohnson> ok...
[10:11:11] <drager> still need the fallback
[10:11:17] <drager> thats where am failing
[10:11:26] <Eels> I'm assuming it's got something to with DOM loading order, but even with document.ready it won't work
[10:11:29] <robertmaxrees> Eels that'd be the inline styles.
[10:11:41] <drager> I'm starting to believe it's my js thats wrong
[10:11:47] <drager> lemme paste it…
[10:11:53] <Eels> The ones Google Maps automatically adds to it in the HTML?
[10:12:02] <unseensoul> Hi
[10:12:20] <robertmaxrees> Eels inspect it with your dev tools - do you see the style attribute that's getting added?
[10:12:26] <cjohnson> drager: either way this probably belongs in ##javascript. this isn't a jquery question
[10:12:42] <MikeD_> $(document).ready( .. ).on('keydown', .. )  <- will that register the listener before ready() happens? or are they chained?
[10:12:53] <robertmaxrees> before.
[10:13:05] <Eels> Font-weight, font-size and margin-bottom
[10:13:06] <MikeD_> cool
[10:13:10] <robertmaxrees> .ready() registers the callback but doesn't stop execution
[10:13:13] <robertmaxrees> Eels right.
[10:13:32] <robertmaxrees> Eels inline styles generally win in specificity without doing some wrangling.
[10:13:37] <drager> cjohnson: https://gist.github.com/drager/a4d18cc6694f0f83cbeb#file-messageboard-js-L49
[10:13:40] <drager> There it is
[10:13:46] <drager> If uou could take a look
[10:14:36] <Eels> I figured that's added at the top of my HTML, when I call the Google Maps API, so just adding a class afterwards with .addClass should work, no?
[10:14:46] <Eels> But apparently it won't overwrite it
[10:16:22] <robertmaxrees> eels the entire infoBar div gets replaced.
[10:16:28] <cjohnson> drager: what's going on with it? does your server respond with a responseText variable in the json?
[10:16:38] <robertmaxrees> Eels and inline styles are getting applied inside of it.
[10:16:51] <robertmaxrees> you're going to have a helluva time trying to modify those contents without some hacks.
[10:17:02] <robertmaxrees> or using painfully slow mutation obersvers.
[10:17:06] <robertmaxrees> *observers
[10:17:47] <drager> cjohnson: Na, that some js stuff or jquery I believe
[10:17:59] <cjohnson> nope, there's no implied data.responseText
[10:18:03] <drager> my server returns an json array with the keys; "messages" and "timestamp"
[10:18:05] <unseensoul> http://jsfiddle.net/f40qnvkf/ ; The function will do its job when its first run, but if I try to run again I get an "GET http://localhost:8000/conversation/1/2/2 500 (Internal Server Error) jquery-1.11.1.min.js:4send jquery-1.11.1.min.js:4m.extend.ajax jquery-1.11.1.min.js:4loadOlderMessages 1:172onclick" error. Why is that?
[10:18:06] <cjohnson> unless your response includes responseText
[10:18:23] <drager> It must be
[10:18:26] <drager> Give me a sec
[10:20:25] <robertmaxrees> unseensoul that's an issue with your server.
[10:20:27] <robertmaxrees> not with your js
[10:20:53] <Eels> Reckon this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18281770/disable-css-styles-in-google-maps-3-14-infowindow 1-year-old answer would still work?
[10:20:59] <unseensoul> robertmaxrees,  I'm running apache. What could it be?
[10:21:16] <robertmaxrees> unseensoul no clue - 500 errors usually means the application barfed.
[10:21:21] <Eels> Or just loading an older version of the Maps API
[10:21:38] <robertmaxrees> Eels you can try it.
[10:22:28] <drager> cjohnson: http://puu.sh/d3Rvi/5350545ae5.png
[10:22:55] <drager> Nothing that I have added
[10:25:00] <cjohnson> that's the xhr object, not the response object
[10:25:05] <cjohnson> where are you logging that
[10:25:19] <cjohnson> oh in the complete
[10:25:30] <cjohnson> I think that makese snese then actually, since I believe complete gets the xhr object
[10:25:36] <cjohnson> why not in the success event?
[10:25:42] <drager> I log it here; https://gist.github.com/drager/a4d18cc6694f0f83cbeb#file-messageboard-js-L73
[10:26:40] <Eels> Welp, neither one of those worked :/
[10:29:40] <cjohnson> drager: why use complete though? instead of success
[10:30:39] <drager> cjohnson: Well, I thought I had something todo with the long polling, since the connection is always open
[10:30:43] <tharkun> I'm trying to tell datepicker to slidedown exactly below the input field yet I am failing to do so. Can someone point me in the right direction?
[10:30:54] <cjohnson> drager: did you read the example I gave you? there was no complete there
[10:31:03] <drager> Na, true
[10:32:35] <drager> cjohnson: Well, that wont help me out so much though
[10:36:20] <cjohnson> why not
[10:38:05] <drager> Still the same
[10:42:35] <Eels> robertmaxrees, Just adding !important after font-size seems to work (in Chrome at least). Thanks though!
[10:42:45] <robertmaxrees> Eels right - specificity wars.
[10:42:51] <robertmaxrees> thought you had tried that.
[10:42:59] <robertmaxrees> it's a good thing to read up on if you're not familiar.
[10:43:15] <Eels> I'm pretty new to the whole web design thing ^^
[10:44:06] <robertmaxrees> ah, then yeah.  get reading :0
[10:52:24] <yakpimp> anyone good with semantic-ui? I'm trying to do some form validation prior to submit, but having a hell of a time
[10:52:51] <yakpimp> it works on blur, but I can't figure out a way to get it to block the normal onclick
[10:53:15] * cjohnson divines yakpimp's code
[10:53:54] <yakpimp> lol
[10:54:14] <yakpimp> let me setup a jsfiddle, It seems the hosted css for them is gone now
[10:55:01] <yakpimp> http://jsfiddle.net/1p8q7joq/ this is pretty much it
[10:55:41] <yakpimp> that works on blur, but if I want to call an asp.net function on click, but only if the validation passed, could you point me in the right direction? PLS
[10:56:08] <robertmaxrees> by "call the asp.net function", do you mean submit the request?
[10:56:11] <Qlue-> Which version of Jquery should I use?
[10:56:18] <_DB> sup guys
[10:56:25] <robertmaxrees> Qlue- depends - what browsers do you need to support?
[10:56:26] <cjohnson> yakpimp: http://semantic-ui.com/behaviors/form.html#/settings
[10:56:35] <cjohnson> never used semantic-ui but this looks like a good place to hook into
[10:56:41] <_DB> I have a onclick button that pops up a file input, then on the input change it submits the form
[10:56:55] <Qlue-> robertmaxrees: i want to make a plugin that uses html5 video cameras
[10:57:13] <_DB> I wanted to make it so when you click the buttton it brings up a prompt to enter a title then open the file input
[10:57:17] <robertmaxrees> Qlue- that doesn't change my question >.> what browsers do you plan on supporting?
[10:57:27] <Qlue-> robertmaxrees:  the most commonly used ones, chrome, firefox, ie
[10:57:27] <_DB> how can I go about that?
[10:57:35] <cjohnson> I imagine you could e.preventDefault with onSuccess: function(e) { ...  or at least return false, yakpimp
[10:57:35] <Qlue-> safari
[10:57:44] <_DB> should I use a before submit?
[10:57:46] <yakpimp> robertmaxrees: yes submit the request to the onclick handler
[10:58:05] <robertmaxrees> Qlue- http://jquery.com/browser-support/ check this out.
[10:59:00] <robertmaxrees> Qlue- if you don't need to support IE before 9 go with the most recent 2.x release.  otherwise, go with the most recent 1.x releas.
[10:59:03] <robertmaxrees> *release.
[10:59:35] <qom2> how can I get first src in a srcset? http://pastie.org/private/kebpedhwjm4jfnlg6lnvg
[11:00:40] <Qlue-> robertmaxrees:  is plugin development for 1.x vs 2.x any different?
[11:01:00] <robertmaxrees> Qlue- the most recent versions of each are exactly the same, just different browser support
[11:01:16] <Qlue-> I see
[11:01:18] <Qlue-> thanks
[11:01:19] <robertmaxrees> qom2 $('img').prop('srcset').split(',')[0];
[11:01:36] <qom2> thanks robertmaxrees!
[11:02:02] <robertmaxrees> qom2 it'll be something like that.
[11:11:38] <yakpimp> here is a more accurate version of my problem cjohnson http://jsfiddle.net/1p8q7joq/4/
[11:11:48] <yakpimp> i would expect the alert to fire in either case
[11:12:13] <cjohnson> why are you exporting the validity check into your own variable?
[11:12:24] <cjohnson> just use the method built into the framework when you want to check validity
[11:12:25] <cjohnson> no?
[11:13:07] <jorvis> Can anyone recommend a simple modal control which actually works?  I just want to be able to invoke it with a click and have it display a paragraph of text.  I've tried three different ones so far.
[11:13:12] <yakpimp> You mean FromIsValid()
[11:13:22] <cjohnson> yeah that stuff. there's already a method to see if a form is valid
[11:13:27] <cjohnson> why export it to your own variable?
[11:14:26] <yakpimp> because it wasn't workign so i was experimenting
[11:15:03] <cjohnson> what wasn't working about it
[11:15:13] <yakpimp> the onSuccess onFailure doesn't seem to block the form submission
[11:15:30] <cjohnson> I don't see a return false; in you onSuccess
[11:15:37] <cjohnson> so why would it block form submission?
[11:16:34] <Karlhit> http://jsfiddle.net/4egvuL3q/
[11:16:46] <Karlhit> I need to do works this with php
[11:19:12] <yakpimp> cjohnson: you are correct. I had a different one in my machine http://jsfiddle.net/1p8q7joq/6/
[11:20:18] <cjohnson> your <button> is bad HTML btw
[11:21:32] <yakpimp> why?
[11:21:47] <cjohnson> uh, did you look at it?
[11:21:47] <robertmaxrees> that's not a valid html tag.
[11:21:52] <Prometheian> I think <button> is html5, is it not?
[11:21:58] <cjohnson> <asp:button> isn't
[11:22:00] <cjohnson> but no, it's not html5
[11:22:12] <Prometheian> Oh, wait, html5 just added crap to it
[11:22:23] <yakpimp> should it be <input type="button"
[11:22:28] <cjohnson> <button is fine
[11:22:30] <cjohnson> asp:button is not.
[11:22:40] <Prometheian> http://stackoverflow.com/a/469084
[11:25:18] <yakpimp> this is what I'm using http://www.w3schools.com/aspnet/aspnet_button.asp
[11:25:54] <Prometheian> yakpimp: Are you working on a school project?
[11:25:55] <cjohnson> that's fine if you're writing HTML, but we're talking about the generated HTML. that's all that JS cares about
[11:25:58] <yakpimp> no
[11:26:00] <cjohnson> <asp:button> is not a valid HTML element
[11:26:09] <cjohnson> if you're writing ASP I mean
[11:26:13] <Prometheian> yakpimp: This a personal project?
[11:26:13] <yakpimp> Prometheian: personal project
[11:26:16] <yakpimp> yeah Prometheian
[11:26:16] <Prometheian> Ah
[11:26:27] <Prometheian> Okay, good. Don't use webforms or any of that crap.
[11:26:37] <yakpimp> Im trying to update my website to be awesome, but this is my first time using jquery or anything
[11:26:44] <yakpimp> Prometheian: what should i use?
[11:26:53] <cjohnson> I would just use a normal form with jquery validator tbh
[11:26:57] <cjohnson> it's proven and works well and has a good API
[11:27:01] <Prometheian> Go make a new MVC5 project, learn the MVVM type framework, and then use knockoutJS to build something cool
[11:27:11] <Prometheian> I can link you a project that's literally that
[11:27:13] <cjohnson> hah well that's a little excessive
[11:27:15] <Prometheian> Not the best code mind you
[11:27:15] <cjohnson> unless you're just bored
[11:27:18] <yakpimp> cjohnson: I need to call my server function if it is validated though
[11:27:20] <Prometheian> But it's great for learning
[11:27:22] <Prometheian> ajax calls
[11:27:27] <cjohnson> it's great for learning knockoutJS
[11:27:36] <cjohnson> yakpimp: you can do that just fine with jquery validator
[11:27:47] <yakpimp> does that require the ajax call?
[11:27:56] <cjohnson> wat
[11:28:04] <yakpimp> to call the web method
[11:28:11] <Prometheian> yak, I just messaged you an MVC5 site that uses ajax calls and MVVM
[11:28:16] <cjohnson> yes you can make an ajax request in javascript
[11:28:27] <cjohnson> and yes you can hook into the form submission with jquery validator
[11:28:27] <Prometheian> It's not the very best, but as learning goes it's probably right up your alley
[11:28:38] <cjohnson> to prevent the submission, make an ajax request, and then continue submission if it's valid
[11:29:03] <cjohnson> I was trying to get your semantic ui stuff to work and I can't even get the methods it claims to support to fire
[11:29:11] <cjohnson> even with a stripped down example
[11:29:15] <yakpimp> I actually did that, but the method that got the data didn't have all the functionality i wanted like session objects, and access to the page
[11:29:32] <cjohnson> wat
[11:29:47] <wjw> I'm looking for a plugin that will allow me to drag external tokens/tags (<span>'s) into an editable input field (or which acts the same), so the tags live next to the text. Any ideas?
[11:30:46] <yakpimp> so I use asp.net c# behind calls to do all sorts of stuff (db access, store session data,...)
[11:30:58] <yakpimp> when i setup for the webmethod call using ajax, i wasn't able to do any of that stuff
[11:31:08] <cjohnson> yes you can
[11:31:15] <cjohnson> an ajax request is just like any other request
[11:31:19] <cjohnson> what you do in the backend is up to you
[11:43:16] <unseensoul> http://jsfiddle.net/f40qnvkf/ ; The function will do its job when its first run, but if I try to run again I get a 500 (Internal Server Error). I noticed HTTP/1.1 was sent on the first request and HTTP/1.0 on the next. Why is that?
[11:43:50] <unseensoul> How can I force HTTP/1.1 on ajax requests?
[11:46:07] <robertmaxrees> unseensoul what sort of server-side code do you have?
[11:46:57] <unseensoul> robbyoconnor, php.
[11:47:05] <robertmaxrees> unseensoul i'd also check the URL you're generating and make sure that it's formatted the way you expect.
[11:47:28] <unseensoul> robertmaxrees, I already have.
[11:47:37] <robertmaxrees> and its format matches the first one?
[11:47:45] <unseensoul> Yes
[11:47:57] <robertmaxrees> then the issue is server-side, not client side.
[11:48:15] <robertmaxrees> have you tried directly hitting the URL that's erroring?
[11:50:21] <ko3t> Hi! I wanted to use alpaca or query.forms to build a large survey app, but i was wondering how well query scales? Is it realistic to have 200 forms?
[11:50:42] <robertmaxrees> "query.forms"?
[11:50:54] <unseensoul> robertmaxrees, thanks, I see now where the problem is coming from :)
[11:51:00] <robertmaxrees> unseensoul deffo.
[11:51:10] <robertmaxrees> ko3t and "200 forms" where?  your questions are kind of vague.
[12:08:40] <mcordingley> robertmaxrees: Found something interesting, after an eternity of trying to debug this. The touch handlers _do_ still fire after the page comes out of the cache. Just, nothing happens and no errors trigger.
[12:09:09] <mcordingley> robertmaxrees: Not sure what this means yet, but I'm not losing the event handlers, at least.
[12:34:15] <mcordingley> robertmaxrees: OK, near as I am able to tell, the `moveCarousel` function was somehow getting NaN as the number of pixels to move. Not sure where that's coming from, but this one-liner fixed it: `pixels || (pixels = 0);` to replace falsy values with zero.
[12:34:32] <mcordingley> robertmaxrees: It's a bug of a kludge, but it FINALLY works.
[12:34:41] <robertmaxrees> without seeing the code again, it's hard to say why, but cool.
[12:38:46] <rubyonrailed> How can I use jQuery to change the value of "rel" inside the button?  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/de459806c77d4075e260
[12:39:04] <robertmaxrees> .prop('rel', newValueHere)
[12:40:52] <robertmaxrees> .prop() is used for editing/reading attributes.  you can also use .attr(), but that's a little slower and interacts with the markup, which isn't necessarily what you want.
[12:43:24] <arschmitz> robertmaxrees: thats not entirely true. Prop is for properties ( which are boolean ) attr is for attributes
[12:43:53] <robertmaxrees> i use .prop() all the time for accessing/editing attributes
[12:43:57] <arschmitz> robertmaxrees: changing an attr will change the value even after form reset
[12:44:04] <arschmitz> prop will not
[12:44:27] <arschmitz> robertmaxrees: you should not use them interchangeably this can cause issues
[12:44:35] <robertmaxrees> I don't use them interchangably.
[12:44:38] <robertmaxrees> i use just .prop()
[12:44:47] <robertmaxrees> didn't know about the form reset gotcha though.
[12:44:50] <arschmitz> you should use attr for attributes
[12:45:28] <robertmaxrees> i'd read a while ago that you should use .prop(), not .attr() - is there a guide somewhere that explains the differences?
[12:45:32] <arschmitz> robertmaxrees: check out the section on prop vs attr http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[12:45:36] <robertmaxrees> i seem to get bit less often by issues when I use .prop()
[12:45:50] <mcordingley> arschmitz: .prop() isn't actually boolean-only. There are things that are properly only properties with non-boolean values, like selectedIndex on a <select> element.
[12:46:03] <arschmitz> mcordingley: that is true
[12:46:11] <robertmaxrees> ^ exactly.
[12:46:28] <arschmitz> however those are not attributes those are still properties
[12:46:35] <mcordingley> arshmitz: Yup.
[12:46:36] <rubyonrailed> robertmaxrees thanks!
[12:47:57] <mcordingley> I'm not sure about the exact behavior here, but I suspect that modifying the attribute on an element would in turn modify the corresponding property value. I usually just stay away from .attr() unless I'm building and injecting new elements into the page.
[12:48:13] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1ckeh195/
[12:48:18] <mcordingley> Meh, I'm getting pedantic.
[12:48:20] <arschmitz> robertmaxrees: the section on the attr docs is probably the best i know for attr vs prop
[12:48:22] <robertmaxrees> this is why I use .prop() personally.
[12:48:31] <robertmaxrees> well, unless it's for values.
[12:48:35] <robertmaxrees> then i use .val()
[12:48:37] <rubyonrailed> .prop() wasn't working for me, but attr() is
[12:48:48] <robertmaxrees> rubyonrailed that's... unusual.
[12:49:06] <cjohnson> how are you reading the rel after hte fact rubyonrailed
[12:49:20] <cjohnson> or whatever it is
[12:49:27] <rubyonrailed> Just inspecting the element?
[12:49:32] <robertmaxrees> that'd do it.
[12:49:35] <cjohnson> well yeah
[12:49:42] <robertmaxrees> your inspector doesn't change when you use .prop()
[12:49:59] <cjohnson> that's the wrong way to inspect that the property has changed -- that's the attribute
[12:50:00] <rubyonrailed> True
[12:50:16] <rubyonrailed> what's the proper way?
[12:51:09] <robertmaxrees> console.log() is.
[12:51:11] <robertmaxrees> *it
[12:51:46] * CssNoob good night and good morning y'all
[13:11:25] <reynierpm> hi there, can I get some advice from any here around this topic on SO http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27112860/append-comma-plus-html-if-td-has-any-text-otherwise-append-only-html ?
[13:12:12] <reynierpm> I think this (http://stackoverflow.com/a/27113008/719427) solution will work but I´ve my doubts can any read this link and my comment on the second answer?
[13:14:23] <cjohnson> if you can keep the items in an array you would just rebuild the string whenever the array changes
[13:14:30] <cjohnson> and replace the text with the newly joined array
[13:14:48] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:14:50] <robertmaxrees> do this.
[13:15:03] <reynierpm> cjohnson I not follow you
[13:15:04] <robertmaxrees> also: "i have my doubts" is terrible reasoning for things.
[13:15:43] <cjohnson> reynierpm: keep an array of ['Country 1', 'Country 2'] etc. then add items to that array and then call the array.join(', ') to update the text of the node
[13:15:54] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees I´m not sure is what I mean
[13:16:15] <reynierpm> cjohnson yes, that´s what user said on his answer
[13:16:44] <cjohnson> if there's existing text in the node when your code first fires, you could .split(', ') to initialize the array
[13:16:46] <reynierpm> but since I can have or not previous text there on the td it will be keep or will be erase and changed by items[]?
[13:17:07] <cjohnson> but it would be better to generate the array explicitly with whatever code generates the initial node text
[13:17:17] <robertmaxrees> i'd always store and generate via the array.
[13:17:26] <robertmaxrees> and never rely on what's on the page if possible.
[13:18:36] <tandroid> What do you do if your js executes before your css is finished rendering?
[13:18:45] <cjohnson> disco
[13:18:46] <cjohnson> o/
[13:18:51] <cjohnson> /o
[13:19:06] <robertmaxrees> tandroid it shouldn't matter.
[13:19:11] <reynierpm> well see this case, I have no text and add a few countries, that will make items array contains some countries and them will be set on td as text, but upsss I forgot to add one country so I open the modal once again find the country and add it, in that case how I generate the array once again?
[13:19:21] <tandroid> I needed to get the offset of some floated elements
[13:19:38] <tandroid> But the css hadn't been applied to all of them so it calculated incorrectly on some.
[13:19:47] <cjohnson> reynierpm: keep the countries array in a variable between modal
[13:19:49] <tandroid> Or at least I think that's what happened.
[13:20:01] <tandroid> I set a timeout on the script and it worked.
[13:20:04] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm we'd need to see the UI you're working on, but you can .split(', ') to get the arrays you need.
[13:20:30] <robertmaxrees> tandroid sounds like document ready vs window load is your issue.
[13:20:58] <tandroid> Which one should I have used?
[13:21:05] <tandroid> I used document ready
[13:21:14] <cjohnson> well try the other one then ;P
[13:21:18] <robertmaxrees> tandroid in this case use window load for the specific thing you need.
[13:21:25] <tandroid> I see
[13:21:25] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees give me a few minutes I´ll try to show you on a image how the flow happen
[13:21:45] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm err, show us a functioning example.
[13:22:02] <robertmaxrees> not an image of "how the flow happen"
[13:22:32] <tandroid> I'm opting for an all css solution but thanks for the help robertmaxrees
[13:22:42] <tandroid> Was more curious than anything.
[13:23:24] <reynierpm> robertmaxress is a bit complicated for me do that since I have not a live example just in dev env
[13:23:28] <robertmaxrees> tandroid the issue isn't rendering but rather when assets are done downloading.
[13:23:55] <tandroid> Ah that makes more sense.
[13:23:59] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm a small, self-contained example is what we're looking for, but it sounds like you're overcomplicating things.
[13:24:05] <Karlhit> why I get this error ::: Disallowed Key Characters: jtable
[13:24:33] <robertmaxrees> reynierpm in any event, you'd want to use .split() on strings and .join() on arrays to get what you want.
[13:24:35] <robertmaxrees> and with that, lunch.
[13:24:36] <robertmaxrees> brb
[13:24:52] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees, it realies on server side calls, and validation and so on
[13:25:02] <reynierpm> let me see how I show you that
[13:26:57] <cjohnson> none of that sounds like it's relevant to the actual problem though
[13:28:11] <reynierpm> cjohnson that was with me?
[13:28:15] <reynierpm> *for me
[13:28:19] <cjohnson> yep
[13:29:10] <reynierpm> ok what can I do is to share my screen with yours on some TeamViewer session or Hangouts or Skype or something else will be more easy than setup the whole thing, do not you think?
[13:30:46] <cjohnson> it sounds like you need to figure out a reduced test case for your problem ;)
[13:31:22] <cjohnson> find the pieces absolutely necessary to demonstrate your issue and put them into a jsfiddle
[13:31:42] <cjohnson> server side stuff and validation doesn't sound like it's absolutely a part of the problem, so they don't belong in the fiddle
[13:32:32] <reynierpm> ok let me see how can I do that
[13:54:31] <jerware> hi
[13:54:37] <jerware> If I'm sending an object, say an array to the server in an $.post(), must I JSON.stringify that object ?
[13:55:39] <cjohnson> as the data attribute? it will do it for you
[13:55:52] <cjohnson> actually it won't be JSON.stringify it will be a post string url encoded
[13:56:07] <cjohnson> you could stringify it if your backend expects a JSON string
[14:17:04] <reynierpm> cjohnson take a look at this code http://jsbin.com/wiqanuqeto/1/edit?js,console that´s pretty much what I want, but if I add a new value on the fly to data.entities (don´t have any idea how to do it on this jsbin) the output will be Bolivia, Brasil, Chile, ColombiaEcuador I mean it keep the old one but the new is added in the wrong way, should be Bolivia, Brasil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador
[14:17:19] <reynierpm> cjohnson this is what I am trying to do
[14:18:19] <reynierpm> robertmaxrees you there?
[14:21:45] <cjohnson> put that code into a function that you can executem more than once, when you want to add a country, push it to data.entities
[14:21:49] <cjohnson> and re-execute the code below
[14:23:29] <reynierpm> ummm how I do that? I mean I can get you logic behind your explanation
[14:24:46] <reynierpm> *I can not get
[14:29:26] <cjohnson> which part is tripping you up?
[14:30:33] <reynierpm> cjohnson lets said I add this countries on the first execution Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba
[14:30:41] <reynierpm> then in second one I add this others Bolivia, Chile
[14:31:00] <reynierpm> then the result on TD with my solution is Colombia, Costa Rica, CubaBolivia, Chile and should be Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Bolivia, Chile
[14:31:26] <reynierpm> I need to append a colon after the latest previous element added in order to keep things cool
[14:31:37] <cjohnson> no it wouldn't, if you push Bolivia and Chile to the array
[14:31:43] <cjohnson> and then re-join the array on ,
[14:31:59] <cjohnson> the new output would be Columbia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Bolivia, Chile
[14:32:34] <reynierpm> that is the problem I do not know how to leave the old values and append the new to items[]
[14:32:56] <cjohnson> data.entities.push({'pais': 'Bolivia'})
[14:33:05] <cjohnson> and then re-execute from the if statement down
[14:33:07] <reynierpm> since in my code items[] got cleaned all the time and is append() who do the job
[14:35:43] <cjohnson> http://jsbin.com/fikofasuda/1/edit?js,console  if you want to cheat
[14:38:06] <reynierpm> ok let me try that way give me a minute is what I want
[14:45:16] <reynierpm> cjohnson take a look at the code I posted on the link you share
[14:45:35] <cjohnson> you'll have to share your own link
[14:45:41] <reynierpm> ok wait
[14:45:43] <cjohnson> the link I shared is the code I wrote
[14:46:08] <reynierpm> here http://jsbin.com/copitosapa/1/edit
[14:46:33] <reynierpm> it is not well formed I just want that you see what I ´m doing and where I´m execute the code
[14:47:08] <cjohnson> ok
[14:47:09] <reynierpm> any time I hit on a button I call the $.post and do some stuff at server side level and that server side is which return the new countries I add
[14:47:32] <reynierpm> for that reason I can not keep the previous one and push the new ones
[14:47:39] <cjohnson> sure you can
[14:47:42] <reynierpm> the old one are erased all the time
[14:47:46] <cjohnson> store it in a global variable, and when the server returns the new ones
[14:47:46] <reynierpm> how?
[14:47:50] <cjohnson> push them onto the variable
[14:47:54] <cjohnson> exactly how I showed you in my example
[14:48:12] <cjohnson> notice how I used the same list and then I pushed Cuba onto it
[14:48:51] <cjohnson> also your example here is...missing a chunk of code. You're referencing the returnList function I wrote but you didn't include the returnList function code
[14:49:15] <reynierpm> yes, I forgot to add wait
[14:50:03] <reynierpm> ok less code
[14:50:34] <reynierpm> where I should write the global variable you mention earlier in order to keep things as you do on your example
[14:50:59] <cjohnson> some place that's accessible from the code that reads the server response
[14:51:57] <reynierpm> the only way I can see to do this is to set some cookie var on first execute and them on second or third check if that var is true
[14:52:15] <cjohnson> no, a normal variable is fine
[14:52:27] <cjohnson> a cookie is only necessary if you need to save state between page loads
[14:52:37] <cjohnson> but since this is just an ajax request the variable will suffice
[14:52:44] <reynierpm> this post is execute from whitin a bootstrap modal
[14:52:59] <cjohnson> as long as the page isn't reloading, you can keep using the same variable.
[14:53:53] <reynierpm> no the page is not relaoded it just call a boostrap modal where the select to pick new countries is and on click of a button call $.post once and once
[14:54:15] <cjohnson> ok. then a normal variable is fine
[14:55:12] <reynierpm> a normal variable like a flag? something like var firstTime = true and then put it on false?
[14:55:37] <reynierpm> honestly I am not getting the logic on my mind
[14:56:00] <cjohnson> the example I gave you demonstrates exactly what you need to do
[14:56:02] <cjohnson> var data
[14:56:04] <cjohnson> that's a normal variable
[14:56:07] <cjohnson> I'm pushing to that normal variable
[14:56:13] <cjohnson> then I read form that normal variable to build the new list
[14:56:39] <cjohnson> the bit at the bottom, where I do data.entities.push, that's what you need to do after the server responds
[14:57:25] <reynierpm> umm wait
[14:57:50] * cjohnson waits
[15:02:24] <reynierpm> ok what about if all the time I get data.entities from server response?
[15:03:13] <cjohnson> not sure what you mean
[15:03:43] <reynierpm> sorry for my ignorance I just not know how to fit your code on my situation
[15:04:46] <cjohnson> move the bit that does data.entities.push into the ajax response callback
[15:05:20] <cjohnson> I can't really make it any more obvious than that
[15:05:21] <reynierpm> done
[15:05:58] <reynierpm> ok that will works for that example but see this use case
[15:06:27] <reynierpm> first execute: data = {
[15:06:28] <reynierpm>      "entities":[{"pais":"Bolivia"},{"pais":"Brasil"},{"pais":"Chile"}]
[15:06:28] <reynierpm>   };
[15:06:51] <reynierpm> second one: data = { "entities":[{"pais":"Colombia"}]};
[15:07:03] <cjohnson> you can use array.concat(secondarray) to put two arrays together
[15:07:08] <cjohnson> it will return the combined arrays
[15:07:26] <reynierpm> in both cases pais comes already on data.entities so that where my miss understanding comes from
[15:07:43] <cjohnson> so let's say on first load you set var fullList = data.entities;
[15:07:51] <cjohnson> then after that you do fullList = fullList.concat(data.entities);
[15:07:57] <cjohnson> and fullList will contain all the elements of both lists
[15:08:06] <cjohnson> and you can keep concatting more arrays
[15:08:19] <reynierpm> so each time I execute the code I should create a new one?
[15:08:27] <cjohnson> create a new what
[15:08:46] <reynierpm> new list
[15:08:58] <cjohnson> right, you append the new list onto the existing list to get a new list
[15:09:17] <cjohnson> ['a', 'b'].concat(['c'])  will give you ['a', 'b', 'c']
[15:09:27] <cjohnson> ['a', 'b', 'c'].concat(['d'])  will give you ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
[15:09:57] <reynierpm> wait let me change my code to see if I get now what you say
[15:09:59] <reynierpm> waits
[15:12:57] <reynierpm> take a look now please
[15:13:14] <cjohnson> need a link... ;)
[15:13:20] <reynierpm> http://jsbin.com/copitosapa/1/edit
[15:13:58] <cjohnson> getting there
[15:14:05] <cjohnson> do you have a list of countries on page load?
[15:14:08] <cjohnson> or do they all come from ajax requests
[15:14:21] <reynierpm> they come from ajax request
[15:14:53] <cjohnson> ok, right now you're overwriting fullList each time ajax responds. at the top of the code, put var fullList = [];
[15:15:21] <reynierpm> I am afraid so
[15:15:24] <cjohnson> and concat onto fullList instead of newIteration
[15:16:05] <cjohnson> you also don't want to append the text, you want to replace it, so instead of .append you want .html
[15:16:18] <cjohnson> ie http://jsbin.com/zegaqoboya/1/edit?html,js,output
[15:17:01] <reynierpm> ok give me a minute let me try that solution
[15:20:03] <reynierpm> I think I need to clean fulllist in somewhere
[15:20:04] <reynierpm> see this
[15:20:22] <reynierpm> first execution added this: Brasil, Colombia, Ecuador
[15:20:32] <reynierpm> second: Cuba, El Salvador
[15:20:40] <reynierpm> result: Brasil, Colombia, Ecuador, Cuba, El Salvador
[15:20:44] <reynierpm> that is right
[15:20:55] <reynierpm> another row
[15:21:16] <reynierpm> first execution added: Brasil, Colombia, Ecuador
[15:21:23] <reynierpm> second: Panamá
[15:21:31] <reynierpm> result: Brasil, Colombia, Ecuador, Cuba, El Salvador, Panamá
[15:21:41] <reynierpm> i nsome place its getting the old results
[15:21:53] <cjohnson> well then, it's not the first execution is it ;)
[15:22:19] <cjohnson> if you're re-using the code between "sessions" you'll have to clear the list when you start a new session
[15:22:29] <cjohnson> whatever session means. maybe modal open?
[15:22:33] <tharkun> I'm having some trouble getting the i18n files for datepicker. Does anyone know where they are located?
[15:22:38] <reynierpm> something that I dont tell you before I have two ways to get on this
[15:23:57] <reynierpm> so in what I said before the first execution is on the first way to get on the same code, the second one is in the other way but both relies on the same code
[15:24:03] <reynierpm> can be this the problem?
[15:24:39] <cjohnson> hard to say
[15:24:55] <cjohnson> either way, whatever the "first execution" bit is, just add a lin to clear fullList
[15:25:05] <cjohnson> when you first begin creating the list, wherever that may be in your code
[15:25:42] <reynierpm> perhaps on the returnList function?
[15:28:32] <cjohnson> no
[15:28:46] <cjohnson> that isn't the "first execution" bit
[15:29:06] <cjohnson> that's used every time the list changes, so obviously you wouldn't want to clear the list out there
[15:49:14] <reynierpm> hmmm cjhnson I dont know where to clear fullList[] :|
[15:49:56] <reynierpm> cjohnson I dont know where to clear fullList[] :|
[16:20:06] <tharkun> If I want people to download from a content provider like google the following file jquery.ui.datepicker-es.js How do I look for it on their site? What is my search term?
[16:26:36] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:27:44] <tharkun> google distributes jquery through its network. And so other people. How can I learn how to tap into those resources.
[16:27:52] <tharkun> Sorry if I am not clear.
[16:27:59] <robertmaxrees> for what purpose?
[16:28:08] <robertmaxrees> are you just looking for a CDN to use jquery from?
[16:28:17] <robertmaxrees> or a specific plugin?
[16:29:42] <cjohnson> reynierpm: again, wherever it is that your "first execution" code is. whatever that may mean
[16:29:46] <cjohnson> I can't tell you since it's not my code
[16:31:30] <tharkun> robertmaxrees: just a CDN to use jquery from.
[16:32:10] <tharkun> and how to investigate what plugins it has available. Google is beeing a jerk today.
[16:32:10] <cjohnson> jquery? or a plugin for jquery (ui)?
[16:32:21] <cjohnson> plugins aren't likely to be on a CDN
[16:32:31] <cjohnson> you'll probably have to self-host
[16:32:37] <Pentium44> Hello, I was wondering how I could have a keydown event only respond to one key stroke per 4 seconds or so?
[16:32:58] <tharkun> cjohnson: ok. I'll make arrangements for that then. Thanks.
[16:33:15] <robertmaxrees> tharkunhttps://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide
[16:33:17] <Pentium44> so for example, if you press W, it will activate something and you won't be able to use the keys again until 4 seconds is up
[16:33:24] <Pentium44> any ideas?
[16:33:25] <robertmaxrees> this is everything google has available for js
[16:33:34] <robertmaxrees> tharkun https://cdnjs.com/ this is another listing.
[16:33:50] <robertmaxrees> the second one i linked has a way for you to request additions.
[16:35:30] <cjohnson> Pentium44: you want a throtte, or a debounce
[16:35:47] <cjohnson> somebody posted a fiddle the other day demonstrating the difference. underscore provides both
[16:36:03] <cjohnson> http://jsfiddle.net/amyseqmedia/dD99u/37/
[16:36:14] <cjohnson> it also demonstrates how to use them ;)
[16:36:40] <Pentium44> cjohnson, thank you, this is for a game so I was just trying to manage the fact that you could hold down a key and fly across the map :)
[16:36:57] <tharkun> robertmaxrees: Thanks bookmarked :D
[16:37:13] <cjohnson> I suspect you want a throttle
[16:37:22] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7686197/how-can-i-avoid-autorepeated-keydown-events-in-javascript
[16:37:26] <robertmaxrees> you want something like this.
[16:37:47] <robertmaxrees> set a boolean that you then swap out when keyup happens
[16:38:10] <Pentium44> cjohnson, so basically $(document).on("click", _.throttle(someFunction, 3000));
[16:38:19] <Pentium44> quick little example :)
[16:39:09] <Pentium44> ha this is so handy, thanks again cjohnson
[16:39:15] <cjohnson> well that would stop you from firing repeated clicks on the document within a short period. check out robertmaxrees' suggestion as well
[16:39:20] <cjohnson> depends what your intention is
[16:39:33] <cjohnson> I do really like those helpers though yeah
[16:47:14] <Pentium44> cjohnson, I want them to be able to hold down a key but only execute a function every 200 milliseconds thought
[16:47:43] <cjohnson> throttle sounds like the right answer
[16:47:50] <cjohnson> except you don't want 3000 if you want every 200 ms
[16:50:12] <Pentium44> Oh I know, it was an example
[16:50:13] <Pentium44> http://jsfiddle.net/ognLs7tu/
[16:50:44] <Pentium44> here is what I have atm, without throttle, would I include throttle to the whole keydown function?
[16:50:51] <Pentium44> it starts ib kuje 331
[16:50:57] <Pentium44> on line*
[16:50:57] <cjohnson> ah, keydown is different
[16:51:07] <cjohnson> since it will only fire the once for initial press
[16:51:19] <cjohnson> I think you'd have to use keypress...but it behaves differently than keydown
[16:51:37] <cjohnson> omg my eyes
[16:51:46] <cjohnson> the nesting
[16:52:02] <Pentium44> what do you mean, it only fires the once for initial press?
[16:52:18] <cjohnson> if you press w without releasing, it only fires one keydown event
[16:52:18] <Pentium44> if you hold a key down, it will constantly fire walkAnimate
[16:52:24] <cjohnson> oh?
[16:52:48] <Pentium44> yeah, its in a loop basically with the $(document).ready(function()...
[16:52:58] <cjohnson> that's not a loop
[16:53:02] <cjohnson> have you actually run this code?
[16:53:10] <Pentium44> yep
[16:53:16] <Pentium44> want me to archive all the content for you?
[16:53:26] <cjohnson> no that's alright
[16:53:46] <Pentium44> mkay, and what do you mean nesting?
[16:53:47] <cjohnson> I guess I misunderstood keydown, I didn't realize the OS/browser sent multiple keydowns for holding it
[16:53:53] <cjohnson> I just verified that it works as you expect
[16:54:04] <cjohnson> in which case yeah just wrap the event handler for the keydown in _.throttle
[16:54:04] <Pentium44> ahh, alright
[16:54:16] <Pentium44> ohh?
[16:54:20] <Pentium44> that's easy, haha
[16:54:23] <Pentium44> let me do thar
[16:54:24] <Pentium44> that*
[16:54:29] <cjohnson> yep that's why those helpers are so damned nifty
[16:54:32] <reynierpm> cjohnson sorry for the delay, how do I clear a array? fulllist = [];
[16:54:39] <cjohnson> yep reynierpm exactly
[16:54:42] <cjohnson> it's case sensitive though
[16:54:44] <cjohnson> fullList = [];
[16:55:00] <reynierpm> okey let me try and see if my tough are valid
[16:57:40] <Pentium44> cjohnson, I don't think I am wrapping the event handler correctly
[16:57:54] <cjohnson> let's see. are you including underscore?
[16:57:59] <cjohnson> or at least copying the throttle source
[16:58:53] <Pentium44> ohh wait
[16:59:00] <Pentium44> is throttle not included by jquery?
[16:59:12] <cjohnson> nope that's an underscore method
[16:59:17] <cjohnson> I'm sure the source is fairly small
[16:59:18] <robertmaxrees> not the one from underscore
[16:59:24] <cjohnson> but now that I think of it... you might want debounce after all
[16:59:37] <Pentium44> ahh
[17:00:11] <Pentium44> my animation code is so ugly, I need to make it more efficient
[17:03:32] <Pentium44> ohh, alright, I got the resource, and included it, now movements won't work
[17:04:05] <Pentium44> did $(document).keydown(_.throttle(function(e){...
[17:04:11] <reynierpm> cjohnson did not work, dont know what else to do :|
[17:04:25] <Pentium44> $(document).keydown(_.throttle(function(e){...}),200) that is more of what I did ;)
[17:06:59] <Pentium44> Oh, nevermind, bad syntax
[17:07:07] <Pentium44> fixed it and it works great cjohnson, thanks!
[17:32:06] <redGod> anyone here ever use fotorama?
[17:33:01] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ redGod
[17:33:01] <b-ot> redGod: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:36:04] <redGod> I am trying to set the height on it to 100% - 5-px which with css I could normal do using the calc function but footmark sets the hight on the tag which over rides my css now i am looking for a way to achieve this
[17:36:21] <robertmaxrees> have a fiddle to demonstrate?
[17:36:37] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise you'll want to use .css()
[20:43:07] <yakpimp> I'm going to cut somethign in half!!! I have a very strange problem. If I have a param passed to my aspx page like ?id=blahblah, I get an error about whatever the first line in my <script> tag is. Like this... Line: 144
[20:43:11] <yakpimp> Error: Object doesn't support property or method 'dropdown'
[20:43:14] <yakpimp> any ideas?
[20:57:07] <Snerf> yakpimp, paste some code
[21:03:20] <yakpimp> trying jsfiddle keeps erasing it
[21:05:42] <yakpimp> Snerf: is jsfiddle working for you?
[21:14:10] <Snerf> plenty of other sites to use, if its broke
[21:31:01] <MetalHead77> I have a php script here that returns data from a single MySQL database table in JSON format in response to an ajax request: http://pastebin.com/k680CDWH
[21:31:04] <MetalHead77> Also, here is the jquery ajax() request set up: http://pastebin.com/CV3fwten
[21:31:11] <MetalHead77> That successfully works for retrieving data from one table but lets say that I want to pull data from another table as well and return it in the same response as with the original one above, how would I go about doing that?
[21:33:50] <Uhkis> MetalHead77: ##php
[21:34:40] <MetalHead77> Uhkis: I know how to pull data from another table in php, I am asking, how would I retrieve it in the same response as above with jquery?
[21:37:34] <Uhkis> just like you would in non-js php
[21:37:55] <MetalHead77> Uhkis: Huh?
[21:38:23] <yakpimp> Snerf: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=2WxyPZuA here's a pastebin
[21:38:41] <Uhkis> $records['table1'][] = stuff; $records['table2'][] = stuff;
[21:39:14] <Uhkis> ?demo @ yakpimp
[21:39:14] <b-ot> yakpimp: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[21:39:51] <Uhkis> MetalHead77: also you should really use pdo instead of the regular mysql driver
[21:40:17] <MetalHead77> Uhkis: And when I echo that to my jquery event, how do I get the data for 'table1' and 'table2' ?
[21:40:28] <yakpimp> Uhkis: it only fails when I pass in a query string
[21:41:34] <Uhkis> MetalHead77: should be in item.table1.column_name
[21:41:50] <Uhkis> MetalHead77: console.log is your friend
[21:44:06] <MetalHead77> Uhkis: Hmm, I don't want any assumptions here, it's either you know it will be in item.table1.column_name or not
[21:46:37] <Uhkis> wow.
[21:47:37] <MetalHead77> Uhkis: What?
[21:48:35] <yakpimp> MetalHead77: that was kinda douchy
[21:49:09] <MetalHead77> I'm sorry if I came off as douchy. It is just 1 AM and I am tired.
[21:49:18] <MetalHead77> Sorry about that.
[21:49:41] <yakpimp> now hug it out
[21:50:34] <MetalHead77> Uhkis, so are you sure?
[21:50:44] <MetalHead77> I just don't want my efforts to be wasted
[21:50:51] <MetalHead77> Been at this for quite a while now
[21:55:41] <reynierpm> any here awake?
[21:55:55] <reynierpm> can I get some help on this SO topic? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27119684/concat-objects-is-not-working-or-i-need-to-convert-values-to-the-right-format
[22:41:22] <norc> Hi. Why doesnt this toggle the header of the table? http://jsfiddle.net/7jdeemeo/
[22:42:37] <Cork> norc: the button is a sibling not a child
[22:42:41] <Cork> so .closest won't find it
[22:43:21] <Cork> norc: http://jsfiddle.net/7jdeemeo/1/
[22:44:24] <norc> Cork: What does this have to do with the button?
[22:45:00] <norc> Cork: The $(this) refers to the $(td.toggleColumn).each
[22:45:03] <Cork> ah, sorry you have an each loop in there
[22:47:16] <Cork> ah
[22:47:23] <Cork> norc: you have td in the header not th
[22:47:35] <Cork> so .find('th:eq(' + $(this).index() + ')') won't find anything
[22:56:40] <norc> Cork: Oh yeah I mixed that up. Let me try to make a new testcase.
[23:04:56] <norc> Cork: Figured out what the problem is. http://jsfiddle.net/7jdeemeo/3/
[23:05:43] <norc> Cork: I toggle the header once for each row... >_>
[23:20:52] <Cork> norc: so what exactly are you trying to do?
[23:21:49] <Cork> norc: if you just statically want to toggle that column, just set the class on th too
[23:22:06] <Cork> and do $('table .toggleColumn').toggle()
[23:25:18] <norc> Cork: I want to dynamically hide the column including the header. So I have to at least get one row in order to get the index.
[23:25:55] <norc> Basically Im using some web builder tool, so all I can do is "tag" the tr>td with classes, but not the column headers.
[23:26:03] <Cork> ah
[23:26:05] <Cork> ok
[23:29:18] <Cork> norc: http://jsfiddle.net/7jdeemeo/4/
[23:30:32] <Cork> ...
[23:36:17] <norc> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/7jdeemeo/5/ isnt this safer? I mean I have lots of tables, so just touching those that have tds with that specific class seems more elegant
[23:36:46] <Cork> that isn't elegant at all
[23:36:50] <Cork> but you have a point
[23:36:52] <Cork> one min
[23:37:48] <Cork> norc: http://jsfiddle.net/7jdeemeo/6/
[23:37:58] <Cork> opps missed one point
[23:38:29] <Cork> norc: http://jsfiddle.net/7jdeemeo/7/
[23:38:58] <Cork> that is a fairly clean solution for doing what you want to do
[23:39:14] <Cork> with the restrictions you have that is
[23:43:29] <norc> Cork: Yeah that looks pretty neat, lets see if I can adapt it to still work with multiple tables.
[23:43:36] <norc> But I get the idea, thank you.
[23:43:52] <Cork> norc: do each table have an id or class?
[23:44:03] <norc> I could give them a class.
[23:44:16] <Cork> then you could use that instead of the target selector
[23:44:20] <Cork> would be quite a bit cleaner
[23:45:27] <Cork> var target = $('.class'); var index = target.find('.toggleClass').first().index(); target.find().filter()
[23:46:01] <norc> Cork: I was rather thinking $('table.toggleable').each(function() { var target = $this.find('td.toggleColumn:first'); etc })
[23:46:18] <Cork> works
[23:46:29] <Cork> you would just use $(this).find instead of target.closest
[23:46:39] <Cork> though if you do it in an each
[23:46:50] <Cork> ah different offsets
[23:46:59] <Cork> scratch that :)
[23:47:24] <norc> Yeah different tables. That ís the thing. I may some tables where I want to hide columns, and others I dont want to touch.
[23:47:55] <Cork> but the ones where you want to hide it would have the column on the same place?
[23:48:09] <Cork> if yes then you don't need the each
[23:48:28] <norc> No. They could be in any position
[23:48:34] * Cork nods
[23:48:52] <norc> And even if they were, I dont want to assume that the web builder magically rearranges the table, or adds display:none columns randomly.
[23:49:00] <Cork> a bit thin on the context, but i think i grasp what you're trying to do
[23:49:05] <norc> It is very expensive software after all.
[23:51:45] <norc> Cork: Meh okay lets look at this again. Forgot that you can have multiple columns tagged as well...
[23:51:50] <norc> :p
[23:52:01] <Cork> heh thought so
[23:52:08] <Cork> ok so more context
[23:53:38] <norc> Cork: It's some web portal builder software. I create some tables, and for lots of internal reasons I sometimes need to add columns to tables that I dont actually want to show (for example to have the values accessible in JavaScript)
[23:54:05] <norc> Or sometimes I want to have this "expert view" kind of option where you suddenly toggle in lots of data in the table.
[23:54:13] <Cork> norc: that case could be better served by data-infotype=""
[23:54:27] <Cork> but ya for expert view the toggle is useful
[23:55:14] <Cork> ok and how is the button related to the column?
[23:55:34] <norc> That could be a "toggle expert view" button
[23:55:57] <Cork> ah, so multiple columns you need to show, but all at the same time
[23:56:00] <Cork> got you
[23:56:07] <norc> Yeah. Basically table-wise.
[23:56:42] <norc> Although hiding *all* onload is necessary too.
[23:56:45] <Cork> man kinda annoying you can't modify the header :/
[23:56:50] <norc> Yes. ;)
[23:56:57] <Cork> ok i have an idea
[23:56:59] <Cork> one min
