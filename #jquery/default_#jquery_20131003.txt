[00:24:17] <jphase> JLT: try:  if(e.relatedTarget.prop('id') != 'orb-container' || $.not($('#orb-container').children())){
[00:26:04] <jphase> might be something different, maybe the opposite of that, and may have to put it in a variable and console.log
[00:27:13] <JLT> if($(e.relatedTarget).closest('#a').length == 0) { i got this as a suggestion.
[00:30:49] <JLT> I may not even need such a thing, could even be another problem. http://jsfiddle.net/hvpaY/18/ hover over the orb, it opens up 2 big menus. hover on the the right menu... and slowly move back onto the orb..i t'll stay open as I want it to.. but quickly move back onto the orb.. around about the center left, it will close and reopen the menu.. this is not expected behavior.
[00:31:17] <JLT> Removing #orb-pic all together works... but for some reason with that div there it doesn't.
[00:32:58] <JLT> So I added in a check for children, it just doesn't work fine if you move fast.. but slowly it does. :/
[00:34:14] <Cork> JLT: the target area changes as you animate the child elements
[00:34:24] <Cork> so if you move fast enough you get leave instead of enter
[00:35:30] <JLT> leave of what element?
[00:35:45] <JLT> orb-container?
[00:35:54] <Cork> all of it
[00:36:14] <Cork> when the children expand you expand the hit area of the parent too
[00:36:54] <Cork> JLT: one way to reduce the problem is to use .stop() on the element before you start the new animation
[00:37:37] <boytoy> If the dropdown is so big it flows out of the page, split it into [fluid] columns and move the overflowing links into those new columns: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/WzWHL/21/ -- are there any ways to simplify this JS though?
[00:37:41] <boytoy> To make it more jQuery-ish maybe?
[00:39:57] <JLT> Cork I'm really not following what you mean, sorry.
[00:41:17] <Cork> JLT: line 6, 17, 18, 26, 34
[00:41:30] <Cork> JLT: run .stop() before you start the new animation, so you don't build a queue
[00:42:00] <Cork> that won't fix the hit area problem, but it will fix the animation queue problem you have
[00:44:11] <JLT> Howcome not 23 and 31?
[00:44:30] <JLT> or 5 ;p
[00:44:40] <Cork> JLT: cause i didn't find them -_-'
[00:44:50] <Cork> but yes do it for all of them
[00:45:48] <Thoams> 'lo
[00:46:07] <JLT> It messes up the positions of the elements too, so should that be .stop(true,true) ?
[00:46:33] <Cork> JLT: no that shouldn't be needed
[00:46:54] <Cork> you should only stop the animation of the element you want to add new animation too
[00:47:01] <JLT> http://jsfiddle.net/hvpaY/19/ ...
[00:48:05] <Cork> looks like you over trigger things
[00:48:27] <Cork> wait...
[00:48:43] <Cork> ah no i read wrong
[00:49:38] <Cork> JLT: i would build the enter trigger a bit differently
[00:50:10] <JLT> Can you explain how I should do it in noob form haha. I struggle to undersand.
[00:50:15] <Cork> JLT: start by adding the enter listener to #orb instead of orb-container
[00:50:34] <Dirkos> How can i decode this: https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FBVPM5nbIYAAV6He.jpg
[00:50:37] <Cork> that way you wouldn't get a mouseleave when you go to the -v or -h element
[00:50:44] <Dirkos> i receive this from the facebook api and i need to load them
[00:51:16] <Cork> js> print(decodeURI("https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FBVPM5nbIYAAV6He.jpg"))
[00:51:21] <b-ot> Cork: https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FBVPM5nbIYAAV6He.jpg
[00:51:32] <Cork> js> print(decodeURIComponent("https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FBVPM5nbIYAAV6He.jpg"))
[00:51:37] <b-ot> Cork: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BVPM5nbIYAAV6He.jpg
[00:51:39] <Dirkos> k thnx :)
[00:51:45] <Dirkos> first time i see it whehe
[01:03:17] <JLT> Ok Cork, sorry went afk. I've emptied the code now. What i've got right now is the mouseenter for #orb, and then it will show h/v. From then what step should I take?
[01:03:49] <Cork> JLT: have hide on mouseleave on the same element
[01:04:08] <Cork> then add the same for -v and -h
[01:04:25] <Cork> that should reduce the jumping problems a bit
[01:06:18] <JLT> Oh! Lemme see.
[01:10:18] <JLT> Not sure about the mouseleave for the h/v but.. http://jsfiddle.net/hvpaY/20/ it's pretty close. Hovering back onto the orb doesn't open up the remaining menus though and it still does chain. This is it with the .stop() http://jsfiddle.net/hvpaY/21/ the elements will move all over the place for instance hovering on the orb.. moving to a menu and quickly move off the whole thing.. then open it back up and it'll be in the wrong place.
[01:10:37] <Cork> ah...
[01:10:39] <Cork> hmm
[01:11:00] <JLT> other than the .stop's and the un-opening of remaining elements, it's pretty close.
[01:11:41] <JLT> may have an idea for the mouseleave. wait.
[01:14:06] <Cork> JLT: hmm looks like a ui problem actually...
[01:14:48] <Cork> ah
[01:14:49] <Cork> no
[01:15:04] <Kingsy> if I do something like this --> jQuery('#scripts').html().replace(/AUID/g, "dsiofjsdoifjsdofisdjofi") <-- if I console.log the output it shows the replace worked. However the replace doesnt change on the page... why?
[01:15:45] <Kingsy> I guess you need to assign it, I kinda assumed it would change using the function, but it makes sense that its only retuning the change
[01:15:48] <Radditz> hello
[01:15:52] <JLT> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/hvpaY/22/ that seems to work ok?
[01:15:54] <JLT> other than the chaining of events.
[01:16:05] <JLT> wait
[01:16:05] <Radditz> is there a way to find scrollBottom ? as in the real height of a container?
[01:16:07] <JLT> it was working
[01:16:41] <JLT> hmm yeah if you move too fast back to the grey area, it won't open up
[01:16:45] <JLT> but if you mov slowly thenit will...
[01:16:49] <JLT> damn so close
[01:17:22] <Cork> JLT: ui's animation additions doesn't handle .stop() as it should
[01:17:33] <Cork> so it doesn't clean up the element when the animation is halted
[01:17:59] <Cork> so i would prob go with using .animate() instead of what you are using
[01:18:55] <Kingsy> ok well this doesnt work..
[01:19:49] <JLT> the heights would vary though... realistically so .animate wouldn't owrk if the height is fexible? i dunno. http://jsfiddle.net/hvpaY/23/ that's it with .stop(true, true)
[01:20:07] <Cork> it would
[01:20:30] <Kingsy> question, if you have a script tag that has a function with a $.get("http://www.google.com/whatever",data) .. blah       and you run another function which uses a .replace() method to change "whatever" to "hello" how come when you execute the $.get it runs the old URL before the replace() ?
[01:20:35] <Cork> you could do top: "-" + $(this).height() + "px"
[01:20:57] <JLT> for h?
[01:21:16] <harpal> I would like to have script which do facebook status post type of thing. Can anyone have any idea how to achieve that?
[01:21:21] <Cork> JLT: for example ya
[01:21:44] <Cork> JLT: well ya, true true works, but you get a jumpy-ness if you go that way
[01:22:20] <Kingsy> Cork: any advise on my problem? by chance?
[01:23:06] <Cork> Kingsy: replace modifies the outputted string, you need to parse the html back to dom again
[01:23:36] <JLT_> I disconnect cork :(
[01:23:49] <Cork> JLT: for example ya
[01:23:52] <Cork> JLT: well ya, true true works, but you get a jumpy-ness if you go that way
[01:23:59] <Kingsy> Cork: well I did.. jQuery('#scripts').html(jQuery('#scripts').html().replace(/AUID/g, "dsiofjsdoifjsdofisdjofi"));   <-- I can see the string change in firebug
[01:24:01] <Cork> that's what i've said since you question
[01:24:11] <JLT_> alright.
[01:24:11] <Kingsy> Cork: but executing the function still runs the old url
[01:24:20] <Cork> old url?
[01:24:34] <Cork> wait, are you trying to modify a js function?
[01:24:41] <Kingsy> Cork: exactly
[01:25:26] <Kingsy> its the url, I need to find replace a placeholder in a URL in another function in the same script tag
[01:25:41] <Kingsy> the url is in a $.get call
[01:26:10] <Cork> Kingsy: you're making a connection that doesn't exist
[01:26:25] <Cork> adding text to an existing script tag does not trigger a js modification
[01:26:40] <Kingsy> 1 sec.. let me show the example.
[01:26:42] <Cork> Kingsy: you could do something like eval(jQuery('#scripts').html().replace(/AUID/g, "dsiofjsdoifjsdofisdjofi")) though
[01:27:11] <Cork> unless the code has checks that prevents it from defining the info twice
[01:27:32] <JLT_> Changed it a bit Cork, haven't done the animates yet but this also kind of works... http://jsfiddle.net/hvpaY/24/ the problem here is that two mouseenter's are being fired and it's jumping it right open (maybe even 3).
[01:28:20] <JLT_> Wait... Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/hvpaY/25/ hows that? the mouseenter is for orb-container only. mouseleave for orb
[01:28:22] <Cork> JLT_: ya, you could check in container the element has been shown
[01:28:23] <Elirips> Hello. If I use $(myDiv).attr({ attr1: "value1", attr2: "value2" }); is it allowed to set empty attributes? Like .attr({ title: ""}); or should I first test if the value of the attr I want to set is empty and only set it then?
[01:28:25] <JLT_> Think it seems to work fine
[01:28:32] <JLT_> That might work too
[01:28:59] <Kingsy> Cork: http://pastie.org/8374134 <-- take a look
[01:29:02] <Cork> JLT_: better, though you still get the jump if the cursor is moved fast
[01:29:35] <JLT_> Yeah. At least I'm spot on with the exception of that though.
[01:29:37] <Cork> Elirips: it is allowed
[01:30:06] <Kingsy> Cork: as it stands, the getId() function when it runs does change the setId function, according to firebug, but when you RUN the setId function it runs the old URL before it was replaced... if that makes sense?
[01:30:08] <Cork> Kingsy: uh, no no no....
[01:30:29] <Cork> Kingsy: wrap your functions in a scope, have a shared variable there, and update it directly instead
[01:30:36] <Cork> don't do something like that....
[01:31:07] <Kingsy> Cork: no, I cant do that.. the url I posted is an example of the output.. the actual way the url is rendered is like mso
[01:31:18] <Elirips> Cork: thank you
[01:31:40] <Cork> Kingsy: so you don't have control of the original script tag?
[01:32:27] <Kingsy> <?php echo $this->getUrl('this/is/some/url/additions', array('id' => "AUID")) ?>  <-- which as the server renders the page it displays http://mydomain.com/index.php/this/is/some/url/additions/id/AUID/key/iodsfjsoidfjsdofisdj5416581/
[01:32:53] <Kingsy> Cork: I don't know what the url will look like until php has rendered it, so I cant pass php a js variable.
[01:32:59] <Cork> Kingsy: that is fine, but that doesn't mean you have to eval the js
[01:33:41] <Kingsy> it doesnt? there is no other way of changing the URL to use the output of the first function as far as I can see
[01:33:48] <Kingsy> because the url is rendered serverside
[01:34:53] <Kingsy> and given the placeholder is not at the beginning or the end, I cant use +data to concat it
[01:35:10] <Kingsy> Cork: see what i mean ?
[01:35:46] <Cork> Kingsy: http://jsfiddle.net/4xXyR/
[01:36:12] <Cork> opps missed a ) there
[01:36:20] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/4xXyR/1/
[01:36:22] <Kingsy> ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[01:36:32] <Kingsy> FFS. I never thought of that
[01:36:37] <Kingsy> damnit
[01:36:47] <Kingsy> Cork: now I feel like an idiot
[01:37:21] <heshanh> hey guys, im using $( window ).resize(function()) to check window resize, it works if the window is being expand but not when its shrinking
[01:37:44] <Cork> heshanh: should work in both directions
[01:38:45] <heshanh> this is my code http://pastebin.com/Ss1NKkhS
[01:38:55] <heshanh> its def not working when shurnk
[01:41:12] <Cork> heshanh: http://jsfiddle.net/ubAWU/1/
[01:41:34] <Kingsy> Cork: out of curiousity, how come you declared the functions as window.functionName = function() {} rather than just function whatever() {} ?
[01:41:49] <Cork> Kingsy: notice the first and last line?
[01:41:57] <Cork> it create a scope around the code
[01:42:07] <Cork> so if you declared them as function name() {}
[01:42:26] <Cork> they would be local to that scope, and not accessable to the world
[01:42:52] <Cork> Kingsy: the reason for the scope is to have the shared variable protected
[01:43:17] <heshanh> ah window, not doc
[01:43:20] <heshanh> got ut
[01:43:21] <heshanh> thanks :)
[01:44:20] <Cork> heshanh: the doc depends on the content, and it isn't guaranteed that it isn't bigger (or smaller) then the viewport
[01:45:00] <heshanh> i see.
[01:45:09] <heshanh> like H scrolling?
[01:45:18] <heshanh> that'd def mess up the width
[01:45:20] <Cork> for example yes
[01:48:13] <lite_> say i want to call a method once i know that the entire page has been fully loaded. i figured id use this : $("body").load( "load", ".overflow_container", handleOverflows); where handleOVerflows is the method i wish to call. How do I accomplish this ?
[01:49:13] <Cork> lite_: no not .load('load'
[01:49:26] <Cork> either .on('load' or just load(
[01:49:47] <Cork> lite_: also it doesn't take a selector
[01:49:58] <Cork> the load event is triggered on window and document
[01:50:07] <Cork> not individual elements
[01:52:39] <Tumulte> how can I debug a getjson that fails when it's in a click(function() but not when executed via firebug ?
[01:53:04] <Cork> Tumulte: add a breakpoint on the code line
[01:53:23] <Tumulte> (by fail I mean .fails() returns something
[01:53:31] <Tumulte> and not success
[01:54:02] <Cork> Tumulte: and does it fail on the network call or parsing of the result?
[01:54:15] <Cork> that is what is the server status code?
[01:54:54] <Tumulte> Cork: no, that's the reason why I'm puzzled
[01:55:14] <Tumulte> the response is exactly what should be
[01:55:24] <Cork> Tumulte: no it doens't have a server code, or no it fails in parsing?
[01:55:38] <Cork> it is one of the two
[01:56:11] <Cork> Tumulte: if the server code is 200 then it fails in parsing the json
[01:57:34] <Tumulte> Cork: nope, the request is fine and the json is parsed
[01:57:52] <Cork> then you wouldn't get a fails callback
[01:58:11] <Cork> how do you know it is successfully parsed if you get a fails callback?
[01:58:29] <Tumulte> Cork: on the network panel I've seen the request pop an disapear
[01:58:35] <Cork> that isn't parsed
[01:58:39] <Cork> that is the raw string
[01:58:49] <Cork> js needs then to parse that to a js object/array
[01:59:01] <Cork> and if THAT fails cause the json is invalid you will get the fails callback
[02:00:24] <Tumulte> Cork: why would it work when executed with firebug then ? Same .json
[02:00:43] <Cork> Tumulte: do you have a link to this?
[02:01:05] <Tumulte> Cork: let me push this
[02:01:14] <mukkk> Hello, I am trying to animte color on hover but I cant get it to work. This is what I have done so far. http://jsfiddle.net/zDrvg/
[02:01:15] <Cork> Tumulte: without seeing it i can only tell you the only two reasons you can get this error
[02:01:19] <mukkk> Can anyone see any issues with my code
[02:01:44] <Cork> mukkk: you can't animate color without jquery ui
[02:01:52] <mukkk> ok Cork
[02:02:21] <mukkk> It still does not work.
[02:02:26] <mukkk> so I suspect my code is faulty
[02:02:49] <lite_> Cork: im probably misunderstanding you but $("body").on( "load", handleOverflows) causes handleOverflows to never execute
[02:03:00] <mukkk> Cork nvm I solved iot
[02:03:09] <mukkk> didn't select li a
[02:03:13] <JLT_> Cork, the .animate equilvent of this... $("#orb-slide-v").hide("slide",{direction:"up"}); what would it be?
[02:03:24] <Cork> lite_: like i said bind it on document or window
[02:03:41] <Kingsy> Cork: very cool man, I will try it out..
[02:04:12] <Cork> JLT_: $().animate({ top: '-' + $().height() + 'px' });
[02:05:05] <lite_> $(document).on( "load", handleOverflows) is never called either, Cork
[02:05:35] <Cork> lite_: where are you adding this line?
[02:10:27] <JLT_> Cork okay I got something... there is a problem with that though Cork. I downloaded a plugin called hoverFlow so all the events are not queued... and that itself actually works pretty neat. http://178.78.101.246/Volrac/ if you hover over the panda and thne hover off.. you can see what the negative top/left has done.
[02:10:36] <Kingsy> Cork: what is wrong with this --> http://jsfiddle.net/4xXyR/2/ <-- there is a syntax error unexpected ;   I cant see a reason why.. looks good to me
[02:10:39] <Tumulte> Cork: online I do have a 200 on this file http://dogmazic.net/plugin_static/coreplugin_dogma/cache/playlists/albums/1.json
[02:11:21] <Cork> Kingsy: the ) i missed in the first example, i posted a fixed link
[02:11:31] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/4xXyR/1/
[02:12:01] <Kingsy> damn I should have spotted that.
[02:12:04] <Kingsy> sorry
[02:14:15] <JLT_> but with the menus closed originally.. nothing opens... hmm
[02:14:28] <JLT_> probably because they're set to a display: none; actually
[02:14:59] <Tumulte> Cork: I mean if you go there dogmazic.net/alpha and do http://paste.debian.net/49339/
[02:15:04] <JLT_> so yeah other than that current issue with the menus still being visible.. it works fine cork
[02:17:51] <Cork> Tumulte: that file is invalid
[02:18:47] <Tumulte> Cork: it is indeed according to json validator
[02:19:11] <Cork> Tumulte: 1. keys has to be strings, and 2. your using an object for arrays
[02:19:44] <Cork> the second isn't invalid by definition, but it will result in some strange effects in js
[02:20:25] <Tumulte> Cork: is it wrong then http://www.projekktor.com/docs/playlists#projekktor_playlist_format ?
[02:20:45] <Cork> Tumulte: that is valid js, not json
[02:21:46] <Cork> Tumulte: what are you generating this through?
[02:22:12] <Cork> Tumulte: http://jsfiddle.net/CB6sS/
[02:22:22] <Cork> opps wrong
[02:22:43] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/CB6sS/1/
[02:23:05] <lite_> Cork: isnt there a jquery way to create a listener that fires whenever an element with class='overflow_container' is fully loaded?
[02:23:15] <Cork> lite_: no
[02:23:22] <Cork> there is no such a term in dom
[02:23:29] <Cork> you can't fully load an element
[02:23:37] <Cork> you can fully load a document, but not an element
[02:25:12] <lite_> crap
[02:29:39] <lite_> Maybe theres another way then. I've got this element(child container) that I use as a container for a number of child elements. In the event that the sum width of these child elements surpasses the width of the container I wish to handle this explicitly. so basically ive made a function, handleOverflows() that checks for this
[02:30:56] <Tumulte_> thanks a lot Cork
[02:31:10] <Cork> Tumulte_: np
[02:31:33] <Tumulte_> Cork: somehow it succeed localy... This is weird. A 200 would have put me on the proper path
[02:31:56] <jned> if you do event.preventDefault for a form submit, how can you submit the form after.  I tried $("#myform").click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $("#myform").submit(); but I get a wierd error about stack over flow or something
[02:32:00] <Cork> Tumulte_: that could not have been handled as json, cause it was invalid
[02:32:21] <Cork> jned: $('#myform')[0].submit()
[02:32:28] <jned> Cork, ooooh, thx
[02:32:38] <Cork> jned: if you retrigger the event you will get an infinite loop
[02:33:05] <krambiorix> hi, in some cases my dialog gets 80% out of my window  and then i can't select it anymore? Anyone any suggestions?
[02:33:19] <jned> Cork, yeah, that was the overflow I guess, thx
[02:33:49] <Cork> jned: yes
[02:34:59] <jned> Cork, it works, but I'm having the same issue as using return, because I cant seem to reset the form after, is there an easy way to make a callback after the form submits to clear the form
[02:35:40] <jned> like after the .submit(), I was to do a couple lines like: 	$('#myform')[0].reset();
[02:36:05] <Cork> jned: you should be able to use reset after submit
[02:36:22] <Cork> ah, wait no
[02:36:41] <Cork> a .submit would reload the page, so reset is pointless
[02:37:02] <Cork> or rather load the result page from the form submission
[02:37:38] <jned> Cork, I have the target of the form as a hidden iframe
[02:37:47] <JLT_> hmm I've changed it... using width/height: hide/show works.. however it jumps at the end. http://178.78.101.246/Volrac/ like at hte very beginning when it opens and the very end when it closes... it skips it and jumps. why is this?
[02:38:23] <Cork> ah
[02:38:37] <Cork> jned: not sure if submit makes it update the cache of the form fields
[02:38:53] <Cork> jned: can you reset the form through a .reset() from the console after the submit?
[02:38:57] <Cork> (don't think you can)
[02:40:09] <jned> no says undefined
[02:40:15] <jned> thats mean I am in the hidden iframe eh
[02:41:36] <jned> Cork, yep I can, it says undefined but it resets it
[02:42:30] <Cork> try setTimeout(function() { $('#myform')[0].reset(); }, 0)
[02:43:10] <jned> Cork, like put that before I do return or .submit() ?
[02:43:18] <Cork> no
[02:43:30] <Cork> well it doens't matter actually
[02:43:37] <Cork> as it adds a timer
[02:43:45] <Cork> but it should be last
[02:43:58] <jned> if its after, it won't get run, no?
[02:44:18] <Cork> no submit doesn't exist the function
[02:44:33] <Cork> jned: if you ran reset before submit you have a problem there
[02:44:37] <Cork> and should try just moving it first
[02:44:59] <jned> if I run reset first, then I don't get the data on the server
[02:46:40] <Cork> ya, of course
[03:00:29] <nutman> Hi, jquery noob here. How do I add an additional variable to an if statement? I've tried the following but to no avail. http://pastebin.com/g7twtwPW - #status is a select, with 'student' being one of the options. It works fine before I add the additional variable.
[03:03:37] <_rgn> $('#status').value is most likely wrong
[03:05:34] <nutman> I agree. I just don't know the correct way of doing it
[03:05:52] <nutman> any pointers welcome!
[03:06:01] <_rgn> see what using .val() returns
[03:08:34] <nutman> same result
[03:08:40] <nutman> nothing happens
[03:13:23] <_rgn> you need do debug the cause instead of blindly trying stuff and wondering why it doesn't work
[03:13:48] <_rgn> use console.log() to see if the return values match your expectations
[03:14:28] <nutman> ok thanks
[03:17:20] <krambiorix> in a msggrowl i want to set text with new lines (<br/>)   , but it just shows the html code... How can i do this?
[03:20:41] <Cork> krambiorix: what is msggrowl?
[03:21:32] <Dudi> hi, how detect selected item in autocomplete ul list in jq ui ?
[03:21:56] <Cork> Dudi: a class is set on the li element
[03:22:29] <Dudi> Cork but some specify class?
[03:22:29] <Cork> Dudi: if you want the hovered element that is
[03:22:29] <Cork> ui-state-hover i think
[03:22:31] <Cork> check the dom inspector
[03:25:15] <Dudi> Cork no extra class is added when I change selected item with arrows :(
[03:26:27] <Cork> Dudi: ui-state-focus on the a tag
[03:28:42] <Dudi> Cork thanks a lot, chrome is sometimes stupid, because when I want expand li tag then ul disappears xD
[03:28:59] <Cork> ouch...
[03:31:15] <dwarder> if ajax failed i have this echoed to my console console.log(e.message); and it equals to undefined
[03:31:34] <dwarder> why
[03:31:35] <dwarder> ?
[03:31:43] <Cork> there is no message on fail
[03:31:54] <Cork> its xhr.responseText
[03:32:23] <dwarder> error: function(e){ e.responseText } ?
[03:32:31] <Cork> no
[03:32:52] <dwarder> i use  $.ajax(
[03:33:15] <Cork> well you can still use .fails, but it doens't matter, you don't get event from error
[03:33:23] <Cork> error
[03:33:23] <Cork> Type: Function( jqXHR jqXHR, String textStatus, String errorThrown )
[03:35:38] <dwarder>  error: function(jqx, err, ex) {
[03:35:38] <dwarder>             debug("data request failed with {0}: {1}".format(err, ex));
[03:35:41] <dwarder>         },
[03:35:42] <dwarder> would do?
[03:36:10] <Cork> second isn't err is is the server status
[03:36:49] <Cork> but ya, except for the namings it should work
[03:40:50] <krambiorix> Cork a bit late but : http://www.bmitravelassist.com/app/js/plugins/msgGrowl/
[03:41:30] <dwarder> Cork: what does it mean:  Uncaught TypeError: Object data request failed with {0}: {1} has no method 'format'
[03:42:06] <Cork> krambiorix: looks like you will have to use the onopen or similar to modify the content, cause it doesn't look like it accepts html
[03:42:34] <Cork> dwarder: you don't have anything adding .format to your strings
[03:42:40] <Cork> so you can't do that templating
[03:44:01] <krambiorix> Cork,  yes onopen but then what?
[03:44:18] <Cork> kraftman: modify the content in the element i guess
[03:44:31] <Cork> don't know the inner working of that plugin
[03:44:34] <kraftman> :o
[03:44:35] <Cork> look through the code
[03:44:47] <Cork> might also be worth modifying the lib
[03:44:53] <Cork> and adding a html option
[03:44:59] <Cork> (and submit a patch :) )
[03:47:13] <dwarder> Cork: i am receiving jsonp and i get parsererror, does it meant that i've received bad jsonp?
[03:47:37] <Cork> dwarder: are you sure it is jsonp?
[03:47:41] <Cork> and not json
[03:48:13] <dwarder> Cork: could it be malformed?
[03:48:24] <Cork> dwarder: are you sure it is jsonp? <--
[03:48:25] <dwarder> Cork: jsonp
[03:48:28] <dwarder> Cork: yes
[03:48:47] <dwarder> Cork: soemhing like mycallback([json here]);
[03:48:48] <Cork> well it could be invalid syntax, it could also be that it calls the wrong function
[03:49:31] <dwarder> Cork: it works 2 times 2 times doesn't, upon refresh
[03:49:54] <Cork> check what data the server sends
[03:50:03] <Cork> and compare it to the url the browser requests
[03:51:56] <dwarder> Cork: i get header as application/javascript and it is sent like api/?callback=my_callback&_=1380797439845
[03:52:10] <dwarder> example.com/api/?callback=my_callback&_=1380797439845
[03:52:13] <Cork> dwarder: check the content
[03:52:18] <Cork> not just the headers
[03:54:56] <dwarder> Cork: content seems to be ok, must it have ';' at the end?
[03:55:03] <Cork> no
[03:55:11] <dwarder> i.e. my_callback([json data]);
[03:55:19] <dwarder> Cork: ok let me remove it
[03:55:31] <Cork> dwarder: it is valid to do either way
[03:55:40] <Cork> is the name on the callback functions the same on all calls?
[03:55:47] <dwarder> Cork: yes
[03:55:57] <Cork> do any of them run at the same time?
[03:55:59] <dwarder> shoul i use different
[03:56:06] <dwarder> they could
[03:56:14] <Cork> there you might have the problem
[03:56:26] <Cork> the function name is generated by jquery globally in the page scope
[03:56:39] <dwarder> let me try to fix it by changing the func name
[03:56:41] <Cork> if several calls have the same function name you will have a name conflict
[03:56:53] <Cork> dwarder: use ? in the request
[03:57:01] <Cork> and let jquery set the function name
[04:00:37] <dwarder> Cork: am i understand right that server is supposed to return ([json data here]) upon request like this example.com/api/?callback=?
[04:01:14] <Cork> dwarder: jquery rewrites ? with a random name in the call
[04:01:42] <Cork> dwarder: the server is suppose to take the function name from the callback param, and use it as a function name in a call from the javascript response it sends
[04:01:53] <Cork> the function it calls should get the json as the first argument
[04:02:22] <dwarder> Cork: so server must ignore ? as a callback name in case some weird dude will try to access it directly
[04:02:33] <Cork> dwarder: jquery rewrites ? with a random name in the call <--
[04:03:00] <Cork> dwarder: ? as a function name would be invalid js and not matter for anyone
[04:06:14] <dwarder> Cork: so i must filter it out from the server..  i remeber calling twitter api directly using callback=? and it returned data like this : ([json data here])
[04:06:24] <dwarder> Cork: thank you a lot
[04:06:37] <Cork> dwarder: no you don't have to
[04:07:04] <Cork> cause if the callback had =? the call would be invalid, and it wouldn't matter for anyone cause the parser would fail on the js response
[04:07:23] <Cork> dwarder: so you just have to put the given name in the function call
[04:15:58] <defk0n> can someone tell me why this code isnt working
[04:16:01] <defk0n> http://jsfiddle.net/2AtSS/1/
[04:16:37] <defk0n> imean http://jsfiddle.net/2AtSS/2/
[04:16:57] <dwarder> Cork: i have one problem with ajax (well, it is related) i load content with ajax, and then i trigger click on some of the elementes that ajax has drawn, but sometimes it is not yes loaded when it got click triggered, how do i 'catch' the moment when it is fully loaded and rendered?
[04:17:26] <dwarder> .ready() on the element?
[04:17:46] <Cork> defk0n: don't put tag names infron of id's
[04:17:58] <Cork> you're slowing down the selector for no good reason
[04:18:06] <seutje> defk0n: add the jQueries
[04:18:26] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/2AtSS/5/
[04:18:37] <Corrado> ot: how can I be notified when the modules are to be updated? for example moment.js 1.0 to 1.2
[04:18:39] <dwarder> or should i use setTimeout
[04:18:52] <Corrado> library
[04:19:27] <Cork> dwarder: where are you triggering the click?
[04:19:42] <Cork> dwarder: and no read or timeout isn't the correct solution
[04:19:48] <Cork> *ready
[04:20:26] <dwarder> Cork: on a li element which has click event on it through delegate
[04:20:43] <dwarder> li element is rendered after .ajax success
[04:20:50] <Cork> dwarder: so you mean you do something like $().load(url); $().click()?
[04:22:39] <dwarder> $('#delegate_or_wrapper_to_which_ajax_is_rendered').on('click','.my_li_element',function(event){});
[04:23:23] <Cork> dwarder: there's no ajax call there
[04:23:43] <dwarder> Cork: ajax call is upon page loading
[04:24:01] <Cork> dwarder: so are you sure the id you bind on exists?
[04:24:36] <Cork> dwarder: what it is about is that you have to trigger the click event from when the ajax call has completed
[04:24:40] <dwarder> Cork: yes everything works , but sometimes doesn't, when the content wan't fully rendered
[04:24:45] <Cork> the listener isn't the problem most likely
[04:24:46] <dwarder> was't*
[04:25:21] <dwarder> i trigger click after ajax success
[04:25:29] <Cork> define "after"
[04:25:41] <dwarder> insice success block of .ajax
[04:26:00] <Cork> and the content you load isn't running extra js or something?
[04:26:01] <dwarder> $.ajax
[04:26:11] <dwarder> hmm
[04:26:48] <dwarder> well i guess it refreshes accordeon script ...
[04:27:13] <dwarder> accordion*
[04:27:54] <dwarder> i think i must try to find out if there is success block to refreshing it and then trigger click inside it
[04:32:46] <defk0n> thanks Cork
[04:34:35] <defk0n> does anyone know when for example i have <a> that is 33% width and 300px height.  and i dynamically append image to <a>
[04:34:39] <defk0n> the image gets constrained?
[04:35:22] <Cork> defk0n: no the children normally affect the parent not the other way around
[04:35:46] <Cork> if the child is 100% width for example they will be the same width as the parent
[04:49:05] <defk0n> Cork oke, thanks. solved it
[05:22:04] <Elirips> Hello. I have a div, inside the div I have a input of type checkbox and a label next to the checkbox. I register a jquery $(myDiv).on("click", function(e) { alert("bla"); }); on the div. Nice is: The functions gets called if I click the checkbox or somewhere in the div. Not so nice is: If I click the checkbox in IE, only the function is executed, but the checkbox does not chagne, while in ff/chrome the function is executed and the ch
[05:22:58] <Elirips> sorry, its the other way round: In IE the click-func is executed and the value changes, in FF/Chrome only the click-func is exectued
[05:46:02] <rabbi1> hi, i have a = [{ key1: value1, key1: value1}]; how can i push another object and make it [{ key1: value1, key1: value1}, { key2: value2, key2: value2}]. also, i am sending a as an argument to a function the second object also passed as a to the same function
[05:46:49] <sunbeam> id like to add some extra data to an input tag
[05:46:55] <sunbeam> can i add data-extra="something"
[05:47:31] <Cork> rabbi1: a.push({key1: val})
[05:47:42] <Cork> sunbeam: yes
[05:47:56] <Cork> sunbeam: data- is free for use on any element
[05:49:10] <rabbi1> Cork: tried that.. will give a try again
[05:49:37] <rabbi1> Cork: also the best way is to keep a count and then push or to store the previous object in a temparray ?
[05:49:57] <Cork> js> var a = [{ key1: "value1", key2: "value2"}]; a.push({key: "value"}); print(JSON.stringify(a));
[05:50:02] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[05:50:27] <rabbi1> object has no method push is what i got
[05:50:36] <Cork> rabbi1: a isn't an object
[05:51:02] <Cork> rabbi1: it is fine to use an array and push to it
[05:51:22] <Cork> ...
[05:51:29] * Cork pokes b-ot 
[05:51:38] <Cork> --
[05:51:38] <Cork> [14:51:11.336] var a = [{ key1: "value1", key2: "value2"}]; a.push({key: "value"}); print(JSON.stringify(a));
[05:51:38] <Cork> [14:51:11.349] "[{"key1":"value1","key2":"value2"},{"key":"value"}]"
[05:51:41] <Cork> there...
[05:51:45] <seutje> odd
[05:51:59] <seutje> js> print(typeof JSON)
[05:52:04] <b-ot> seutje: undefined
[05:52:07] <seutje> AHA
[05:52:09] <Cork> ugg...
[05:52:11] <seutje> :D
[05:52:13] <seutje> figures
[05:52:15] <Cork> it has been there before...
[05:52:30] <seutje> it just relays to ideone though
[05:52:33] <rabbi1> o oops
[05:54:06] <seutje> guess it changed to spidermonkey
[05:54:09] <seutje> http://ideone.com/nTu1UQ
[05:54:18] <seutje> vs http://ideone.com/W6vBAX
[05:54:48] <rabbi1> Cork: my bad the a is without [] so its an object { key1: "value1", key2: "value2"}
[05:54:53] <rabbi1> a = { key1: "value1", key2: "value2"}
[05:55:03] <Cork> rabbi1: then you want $.extend
[05:55:14] <sunbeam> Cork: thanks!!
[05:55:15] <Cork> or just a["key"] = value or a.key = value
[05:55:23] <rabbi1> $.extend(object1, object2);
[05:55:26] <sunbeam> data-extra Cork how can i fetch this content in jquery
[05:55:37] <Cork> $().data('extra')
[05:59:16] <sunbeam> ok
[06:09:31] <rabbi1> var new_object = $.extend({}, newarry, tmpargs); this din't work
[06:12:20] <nettoweb> guys, I have a method 'check_login' and around my website I have many Login anchor tags, I'd like to know if I cant show a modal (Bootstrap) from my method (in controller). Otherwise I would change every "login" link around my site to call a ajax to check this. Can someone has a adivce to do this?
[06:12:25] <nettoweb> like behance
[06:17:43] <sunbeam> how can i best set that the input field does not use the filled in value when you F5?
[06:17:46] <sunbeam> with jquery
[06:18:08] <sunbeam> i mean, that the last set input value gets resetted and the default (in the HTML) gets used
[06:18:58] <rabbi1> WTH $.extend() isn't working :(
[06:20:10] <SprkDev> How do I assign a php variable to a jquery variable? http://pastebin.com/DUUgjLwW
[06:21:50] <sahbeewah> rabbi1, presuming newarry and tmpargs are arrays, it's not going to behave the way you think it is
[06:22:00] <sahbeewah> in fact, i have no idea what you think it will do
[06:22:42] <rabbi1> i am just trying to push an object to another object together in an array
[06:25:00] <seutje> what do u mean extend isn't working?
[06:25:14] <SprkDev> How do I assign a php variable to a jquery variable? http://pastebin.com/DUUgjLwW
[06:26:23] <seutje> SprkDev: suppose that would work
[06:26:44] <seutje> u don't need the echo though
[06:28:18] <rabbi1> i have a = { key1: value1, key1: value1}; how can i push another object and make it [{ key1: value1, key1: value1}, { key2: value2, key2: value2}]. also, i am sending a as an argument to a function the second object also passed as a to the same function. this is what i am upto
[06:28:24] <rabbi1> seutje: ^^
[06:28:42] <seutje> erm
[06:28:48] <seutje> u can;t have the same key twice
[06:29:10] <seutje> well, the values are identical, so I guess it doesn't matter
[06:29:51] <seutje> so u have {key: value}, {key2: value2] and u want [{key: value}, {key2: value2}] ?
[06:30:28] <seutje> rabbi1: sounds like u just want to put 2 objects in an array
[06:31:36] <rabbi1> seutje: yeap, i think i got it… brb
[06:31:54] <rabbi1> n objects in an array …. btb
[06:31:56] <rabbi1> *brb
[06:32:39] <lianzinho> hey guys. How is the best way to pass information buried within a function to another?
[06:32:57] <rabbi1> seutje: yeap, did it.. just a push was enought,,, now to the splice.. thanks for the time :)
[06:33:35] <lianzinho> I have a click event in which I want to capture a parameter and use it within a function inside of another click event, but I don't know where to store this value!
[06:33:52] <rabbi1> I had the init for a varialbe within the function seutje stupid of me
[06:33:59] <seutje> lianzinho: sounds like a racing condition waiting to happen
[06:34:42] <lianzinho> seutje: what do you mean?
[06:35:00] <seutje> lianzinho: so u click X, but only if u clicked Y first, does something need to happen, right?
[06:35:16] <seutje> cause clicking Y gets the param and clicking X "applies" it, if u will
[06:36:14] <seutje> if that's the case, you probably don't have a lot of options besides a global namespaced object or turning ur app into a constructor
[06:36:29] <seutje> then u can store it on its own instance
[06:37:00] <lianzinho> seutje: actually. I click X, it opens a modal with a form. When I click to submit the form it does a lot of stuff. One of these stuff needs the param from X
[06:37:01] <Velveeta> or are you talking about handing off the click event from one element to the other?
[06:37:09] <Velveeta> ahhhhh
[06:37:24] <sunbeam> how can i best set that the input field does not use the filled in value when you F5?
[06:37:28] <sunbeam> normally when you fill in a value in an input
[06:37:29] <Velveeta> does it need that parameter to submit with the form?
[06:37:37] <sunbeam> i mean, that the last set input value gets resetted and the default (in the HTML) gets used
[06:38:36] <Velveeta> sunbeam: why would you want that behavior? that kind of negates the point of having an input form field...
[06:38:38] <lianzinho> Velveeta: no, it doesn't
[06:39:05] <sunbeam> Velveeta: the input field isn't used for actual form input
[06:39:09] <Velveeta> lianzinho: well, you could gind it as data on the form or something
[06:39:28] <Velveeta> sunbeam: could you just make it readonly?
[06:39:37] <Velveeta> lianzinho: bind, not gind
[06:39:41] <sunbeam> Velveeta: maybe
[06:39:47] <sunbeam> i think its already set like that
[06:39:54] <sunbeam> but its being changed after page load
[06:40:01] <Velveeta> brb
[06:40:20] <lianzinho> Velveeta: but the information should be in the link the person first clicked, because it must differentiate from other links which will also open the modal
[06:40:57] <lianzinho> the modal will lead to different sections of an external site
[06:41:10] <lianzinho> which I load with an iframe
[06:41:20] <lianzinho> this is done by a numeric parameter
[06:41:27] <lianzinho> this parameter must be in the link
[06:41:59] <lianzinho> so the user click, input information and the iframe will be loaded using the parameter
[06:42:14] <lianzinho> the problem is that there`s TWO different click events
[06:42:23] <lianzinho> the first one, which shows the modal
[06:42:41] <lianzinho> and the second, which loads the iframe from within the modal
[06:43:52] <matiasnu> Hi all! Am I supposed to DEregister watch-listeners before I refresh the data used in a repeater (with new search results)? I have a listener going off when a list item has a property I'm watching and it differs from the list item that used to occupy the same place. (using angular 1.2rc2 with restangular 1.1.3)
[06:44:01] <lianzinho> i need to pass information from $('.first').click(function{ HERE1 })   to  $('.second').click(function{ HERE2 })
[06:44:06] <matiasnu> Sorry, wrong channel. ;)
[06:45:48] <sammich> what's the bit of code to make sure that only the element the event originated from will run the rest of the handler?
[06:46:04] <sammich> something like if ($(this).is(e.target))?
[06:47:56] <Velveeta> annnnnnd i'm back
[06:48:03] <sekyms> can two instances of the same namespace be run concurrently without causing scope issues
[06:48:15] <lianzinho> Velveeta: so...
[06:48:34] <Velveeta> lianzinho: so yeah, you can bind data to your form to store that value, and pull it at the time of submission
[06:48:34] <lianzinho> Velveeta: basically i need to pass information from $('.first').click(function{ HERE1 })  to  $('.second').click(function{ HERE2 })
[06:48:34] <sammich> hmm, Velveeta, I'm sure you can answer this, because I think you may have said it last night
[06:48:48] <Velveeta> sunbeam: did you get an answer to your question yet?
[06:49:04] <Velveeta> sekyms: i don't think so, if i'm reading your question correctly…
[06:49:11] <Velveeta> sammich: ask away :)
[06:49:23] <sekyms> Velveeta so I need to make a plugin?
[06:49:31] <sammich> Velveeta: stop events coming from other elements from firing, is it if (!$this).is(e.target))?
[06:49:46] <Velveeta> sekyms: define "namespace" for me
[06:50:08] <Velveeta> sammich: stop *all* events from other elements from firing?
[06:50:56] <sekyms> var NameSpace = { init: function() {}, cacheElements: function(){}}
[06:51:02] <sammich> sorry, just the defined event handler
[06:51:22] <sammich> like $el.on('click', 'div', handler)
[06:51:47] <Velveeta> sammich: in your handler, you could receive 'e' and pass it to .off, like $(this).off(e); to unbind that specific event handler
[06:51:51] <sammich> but only clicks on the div will run through the handler, clicks on children are deflected
[06:51:59] <Velveeta> or $(this).off(e.type) to unbind all handlers for that event type
[06:52:42] <Velveeta> sekyms: yes, you can have 2 separately instances of that concurrently as long as they're assigned to different variable references
[06:52:58] <Velveeta> sekyms: var a = new NameSpace(), b = new NameSpace();
[06:53:25] <sekyms> yeah thats not how are code base works unfortunately
[06:53:34] <Velveeta> sammich: so you specifically want clicks on the div itself to be handled, but not clicks on any of its children?
[06:53:40] <sammich> yes
[06:54:11] <Velveeta> sammich: if ($(this).is(e.target)) {} should work for you then :)
[06:54:31] <Velveeta> sekyms: what do you mean not how it works? it has to abide by the rules of javascript...
[06:54:48] <sammich> I'll just go if (!$(this)...) return;
[06:55:04] <sekyms> Velveeta I have name spaces for each module
[06:55:12] <sekyms> i need to run the same module concurrently on the same page
[06:55:33] <sekyms> these name spaces have variables inside of them
[06:55:34] <sammich> thanks, Velveeta, I thought I had it but it didn't work when I tried it by myself
[06:55:42] <sekyms> so like NameSpace.foo
[06:55:44] <sammich> use an object :)
[06:55:48] <Velveeta> sammich: no problem, if it's still not working, let me know
[06:55:57] <Velveeta> sekyms: use an object with a prototype
[06:56:00] <sammich> myspace = {};
[06:56:09] <Velveeta> you can store shared references on the prototype, and maintain separate state in the instances
[06:56:21] <sekyms> example velveeta?
[06:56:51] <Velveeta> sekyms: http://conqueringtheclient.com/object-prototypes/
[06:58:27] <sekyms> yikes
[06:59:07] <sammich> Velveeta: thanks. I think this is succinct enough to prove it works http://jsfiddle.net/ZVtwA/2/
[06:59:08] <Velveeta> sekyms: it's not difficult… you create a function constructor, add a .prototype property to it for shared variables and functions
[06:59:26] <Velveeta> and then assign new myCustomType() instances to variables, which are responsible for storing state
[06:59:44] <sekyms> yeah I get it Im just trying to figure out how I bend it to my code
[07:00:37] <Velveeta> if you want to post a sample of your code to jsfiddle, i can show you how to restructure it as an object constructor w/ prototype
[07:01:09] <sekyms> I might, I can't really share it with everyone
[07:01:19] <sekyms> will you be around in an hour?
[07:01:46] <Velveeta> possssssibly.. i'm at a hospital right now, my wife's having surgery today
[07:02:15] <sammich> on this subject, if it's just a one off object, a closure is enough to keep things private, right?
[07:02:38] <sammich> well, all the best for her and a speedy recovery
[07:02:46] <sekyms> sorry to hear that
[07:03:10] <Velveeta> it's fine, she's getting one of those exoskeletons from elysium installed
[07:03:28] <Velveeta> sammich: only if the namespace modules are declared inside 2 separate closures
[07:03:38] <sammich> I think it'll be sexier if she was getting an adamantium skeletal transplantation
[07:03:49] <Velveeta> if it's declared externally and just assigned to variables inside 2 closures, they'll still be pointing to the same reference
[07:04:15] <sammich> ah, no
[07:04:36] <sekyms> my other option is to use the jueryui library i think
[07:04:39] <Velveeta> sammich: i keep changing up what i tell people, i've also said rectal rejuvenation, nipple lift, and sinus transplant
[07:04:49] <sammich> I'm building fairly big widgets for work and I'm still working my way around keeping as much data obfustated as possible
[07:05:08] <Velveeta> sekyms: jquery ui will just do what i'm advocating already, declare a custom object type w/ constructor and prototype, and store the state in separate instances
[07:05:27] <sammich> I think being married to a female equivalent of Hugh Jackman would be better
[07:05:49] <krambiorix> how can i re-init a jquery dialog?
[07:06:55] <sammich> jQuery UI needs an overhaul like 10 years ago
[07:07:04] <SprkDev> finally it works! :-) thanks
[07:07:15] <sammich> the whole Look and Feel is like 2005
[07:09:25] <Velveeta> krambiorix: el.dialog('destroy').dialog() ?
[07:09:56] <krambiorix> Velveeta, then the dialog will re-open, i just want the content to be reloaded
[07:10:11] <Velveeta> autoopen: false
[07:11:17] <krambiorix> Velveeta, ?
[07:11:54] <Velveeta> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-autoOpen
[07:12:13] <sekyms> Velveeta can I pm you please?
[07:12:18] <Velveeta> sekyms: sure
[07:13:13] <ddssc> anyone knows a google map plugin that supports multiple destination routes ?
[07:14:45] <Aquaword> hi, anyone know whats the name of the plugin which reveales a picture when I scroll down the page?
[07:17:30] <sunbeam> Velveeta: not yet
[07:17:36] <sunbeam> Velveeta: any idea
[07:18:01] <Velveeta> sunbeam: yeah, i threw out the idea of making the field readonly, will that not work?
[07:18:33] <FernandoBasso> I have obj = { var1: 1, var2: 'hello', isOk: function() { // I want to use var1 and var2 here. How? } }
[07:18:39] <sunbeam> Velveeta: doesnt here
[07:18:54] <Velveeta> sunbeam: so what exactly is the use case here you're trying to fulfill?
[07:19:20] <ParanoidGal> Does having an onclick page redirect mean that it will override any onsubmit verification of a form?
[07:19:34] <Velveeta> fernandobasso: this.var1 and this.var2 ?
[07:19:40] <sunbeam> i think ill leave it Velveeta some plugin i use adds the value after the page is loaded
[07:19:48] <sunbeam> so when i refresh it is that value
[07:20:08] <FernandoBasso> This will refer to the thing that called the method, won't it.
[07:20:09] <FernandoBasso> ?
[07:20:42] <Velveeta> fernandobasso: 'this' refers to the object instance
[07:21:07] <FernandoBasso> And what will the the "this" of the method?
[07:21:27] <ParanoidGal> This is my validation file and the main form code http://pastebin.com/q7CmYerb thanks in advance
[07:21:53] <Velveeta> fernandobasso: it should be 'obj'
[07:22:15] <sammich> d = { a: '123', b:function() { console.log(this) }};d.b()
[07:22:21] <sammich> that just goes undefined
[07:24:11] <FernandoBasso> Velveeta: All right. Thanks.
[07:24:35] <Velveeta> sammich: oh yeah good call
[07:24:47] <Velveeta> fernandobasso: you may need to do a 'new' constructor on that object first
[07:24:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: hello
[07:25:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: hi
[07:25:05] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: hello hello
[07:25:24] <krambiorix> Velveeta, are you sure that autoopen thing was meant for me?
[07:25:47] <Velveeta> krambiorix: were you the one that wanted to reinitialize a dialog?
[07:26:22] <sammich> d = { a: '123', b:function() { debugger }};d.b()
[07:26:38] <sammich> that shows that 'this' exists there, though
[07:26:48] <seutje> this always exists
[07:26:56] <krambiorix> Velveeta, yes
[07:26:58] <Velveeta> yeah, it's just the window object if nothing else
[07:27:19] <krambiorix> Velveeta, but that will re-open the popup?
[07:27:26] <Velveeta> krambiorix: then yes, i'd said you could run a .dialog('destroy').dialog() to reinitialize it, and you said that would force it to open automatically, so i showed you the autoOpen: false option
[07:28:42] <krambiorix> Velveeta, destroying it would close it an open a new one, no?
[07:29:12] <sammich> destroying it would destroy it
[07:29:44] <Velveeta> right
[07:29:48] <krambiorix> well yeah, that's not what i want, i want to keep it open
[07:29:51] <Velveeta> you didn't say it was an open dialog
[07:30:16] <sammich> what's changed about the dialog that you want to re-init it?
[07:31:15] <kaldrenon> Is it possible to set up before and after hooks for AJAX requests? For example, I have a 'loading' element that I show/hide, and I've got a frequent pattern of $('.loading').show() / $.get('/foo', function() { ...;  $('.loading').hide(); } - is there a better way to make that more generic?
[07:31:34] <seutje> js> var meh = {a: 'lol', b: function() {return this}}; print(meh.b().a);
[07:31:35] <Velveeta> krambiorix: if you want to refresh the content in it without going the destroy/recreate route, you'll have to actually seek to the .closest('.ui-dialog-content') i believe, and replace its contents w/ .html
[07:31:40] <b-ot> seutje: lol
[07:32:29] <seutje> js> var meh = {a: 'lol', b: function() {return this}}; print(meh.b().b().b().b().b().b().a);
[07:32:31] <seutje> ghegheghe
[07:32:34] <b-ot> seutje: lol
[07:32:41] <rabbi1> how can i get the object from an array comparing the key with value
[07:33:05] <sammich> gegege indeed
[07:33:41] <Velveeta> kaldrenon: you could use $.ajaxSetup to define a beforeSend function to start your loading animation, and attach a complete handler to it to undo the animation, but it would apply to *all* ajax requests at that point
[07:33:42] <seutje> rabbi1: can u rephrase that?
[07:34:13] <rabbi1> i need the object which is 'key' == 'value'
[07:34:35] <rabbi1> seutje: grep() ?
[07:35:25] <seutje> var matches = []; for (var key in obj) { if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) { if (key === obj[key])  { matches.push(key); } } }
[07:35:27] <Velveeta> grep would do it, yes
[07:35:34] <seutje> I always forget about grep
[07:35:57] <wild_oscar> I have a <div> where I have a table with buttons. when I press a button I'm triggering an AJAX post. I want to replace the div with the one coming from the response. However, pressing the same button again doesn't work. how do I reattach the event?
[07:35:57] <wild_oscar> doug65536: you might know this, it's a follow up on yesterday's chat.
[07:36:00] <kaldrenon> Velveeta: I'll take a look and see if I can pull that off, thanks
[07:36:27] <seutje> wild_oscar: delegate?
[07:36:31] <wild_oscar> (this is my simplest approach to managing the result - I just re-render the entire table
[07:36:44] <doug65536> wild_oscar: you should use event delegation for it and attach it to the div
[07:36:47] <rabbi1> var sel = $.grep(arr, function(e) { return e.selected === "true"; }); this returns null
[07:36:51] <kaldrenon> wild_oscar: I tend to use the $(document).on('click') method for binding events so that they're bound to the page and not to the element
[07:36:54] <seutje> just catch all clicks on the document and filter out ur buttons, or have $.fn.on do it for u!
[07:37:05] <sammich> seutje: so you can't access this inside that function, but you can use it once it's been returned.
[07:37:08] <rabbi1> seutje: 'selected' is the key and true is the value
[07:37:11] <doug65536> wild_oscar: $(..the div..).on('click', ... selector for the button ..., function() ...)
[07:37:17] <seutje> sammich: sure u can
[07:37:22] <kaldrenon> wild_oscar: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:37:29] <seutje> js> var meh = {a: 'lol', b: function() {return this.a}}; print(meh.b());
[07:37:34] <b-ot> seutje: lol
[07:37:42] <sammich> do it without returning
[07:38:04] <seutje> js> var meh = {a: 'lol', b: function() { print(this.a);}};
[07:38:08] <b-ot> seutje: No output.
[07:38:13] <seutje> :o
[07:38:24] <seutje> the ref is broke
[07:38:43] <wild_oscar> oh. yeah, I read the on('click') doug65536 mention. I'm doing $('selector-for-button').click(function(event){ - I read it was a short-code for the on(click) so I was wondering why it wasn't working
[07:38:46] <sammich> this is my point :)
[07:38:50] <Velveeta> wild_oscar: you said you're replacing the div with the returned content
[07:38:59] <Velveeta> are you using div.html() or div.replaceWith() ?
[07:39:05] <seutje> I forgot to call it lol
[07:39:10] <seutje> js> var meh = {a: 'lol', b: function() { print(this.a);}}; meh.b();
[07:39:16] <b-ot> seutje: lol
[07:39:18] <seutje> boom!
[07:39:24] <Velveeta> seutje: huzzah!
[07:39:30] <wild_oscar> Velveeta: actually right now I was trying div.empty() + div.append(html)
[07:39:37] <doug65536> did does anyone know what's up with IE10? this didn't work yesterday, jquery crashes during load: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/4YdS5/
[07:39:44] <doug65536> s/did//
[07:39:50] <seutje> so yeah, turns out u have to call a function for it to be... called... :x
[07:40:13] <sammich> dammit, print() open the print dialog, lol
[07:40:23] <rabbi1> may b i amusing it wrong, will check the api
[07:40:28] <Velveeta> wild_oscar: are the buttons children of that div?
[07:40:29] <wild_oscar> I'm actually replacing the div with *a selection* of the response (I may consider changing the response to another thing, but not sure I'll be able to do it in time)
[07:40:40] <seutje> sammich: lol
[07:40:48] <seutje> window.print = console.log; :P
[07:40:50] <wild_oscar> Velveeta: the buttons are within the td of a table which is a child of the div
[07:41:03] <sammich> seutje: so if you replace that print with a console.log, it is undef. Go with alert() it works
[07:41:05] <wild_oscar> (I could just as well replace the <table> instead of the div)
[07:41:05] <Velveeta> wild_oscar: then yeah, definitely event delegation would be the way to go
[07:41:10] <sammich> wonder if it's a chrome thing
[07:41:18] <Velveeta> wild_oscar: you'd still have the same problem
[07:41:48] <seutje> sammich: lies! the return in undef, but the log goes off correctly
[07:41:56] <Velveeta> doug65536: so that page wasn't working yesterday, but is today?
[07:42:12] <doug65536> Velveeta: no, it fails in IE10 in my VM
[07:42:12] <sammich> hmm, is the log going into the wrong space
[07:42:25] <seutje> sammich: http://i.imgur.com/La2fnv6.png
[07:42:27] <Velveeta> are you talking about returning a console.log?
[07:42:36] <Velveeta> because i'm pretty sure the return from that is undef :D
[07:42:55] <sammich> mine doesn't log out anything. Just the undef from the function call
[07:43:09] <seutje> funky
[07:43:12] <sammich> webkit/safari/chrome
[07:43:16] <seutje> js> print(print('lol'))
[07:43:20] <seutje> mine was chrome as well
[07:43:21] <b-ot> seutje: lol undefined
[07:43:53] <doug65536> Velveeta: the only plausible explanation I can think of, is microsoft patched something which broke jquery 1.x. only the bleeding edge dev build of jquery works in IE 10 now
[07:44:00] <sammich> hmm, FF gives me the log
[07:44:51] <Velveeta> doug65536: weird stuff
[07:47:14] <bberry> okay. so i literally just got jquery.  Is the equivalent to document.getElementById("id"); just $("id")?
[07:47:27] <sammich> $('#id')
[07:47:39] <bberry> do you have to use single quotes for it?
[07:47:47] <bberry> oh
[07:47:50] <doug65536> Velveeta: let me rephrase that. NOTHING works in IE10 with 1.x!!! JQuery is utterly broken: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/2vPaL/
[07:47:51] <bberry> didnt see the # sing
[07:48:00] <bberry> sign*. got it, thx sammich :D
[07:48:38] <Velveeta> doug65536: 1.x period? like 1.4, 1.7, nothing?
[07:48:47] <Ericx2x> what does a google analytics tracking code do?
[07:48:52] <doug65536> only the dev build
[07:49:03] <sammich> steals your informations
[07:49:14] <Velveeta> that sounds more like an IE10 issue, is it an evergreen browser?
[07:50:06] <doug65536> well sure, of course it is an IE10 issue. but that means practically every jquery site is broken in IE, right? please prove me wrong
[07:50:26] <sammich> someone here wanted to know if Riddick was a good movie
[07:50:32] <sammich> like, 2 weeks ago
[07:50:38] <jp-> of course it is
[07:50:43] <krambiorix> Velveeta, to "reload" the dialog i try with : http://pastebin.com/SEZBACcc   -> but the html data hasn't been inserted , any idea?
[07:50:46] <jp-> i haven't even seen it yet, but it is.
[07:50:48] <seutje> was about to reply the exact same thing as jp-
[07:50:55] <Velveeta> doug65536: oh i'm not saying you're wrong, i'm saying that if IE10 did push some update that broke all of jquery 1.x, then yes, that's a huge problem for the web right now
[07:50:55] <seutje> it's got riddick.... ON THE COVER
[07:51:02] <sammich> err
[07:51:09] <bberry> !mdn push
[07:51:09] <b-ot> bberry: Manipulating the browser history - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[07:51:11] <Velveeta> sammich: i wanted to know
[07:51:13] <sammich> have you *seen* it?
[07:51:15] <seutje> wait, it does, doesn't it?
[07:51:17] <sammich> thought it was you :)
[07:51:23] <doug65536> IE10 crashes while loading jquery, with this: SCRIPT5: Access is denied. jquery-1.10.1.js, line 1513 character 2
[07:51:23] <seutje> what, the cover? :P
[07:51:25] <bberry> wtf is b-ot?
[07:51:30] <sammich> the movie...
[07:51:30] <bberry> oh shit this is jquery haha
[07:51:32] <bberry> my bad
[07:51:36] <doug65536> the js crashes
[07:51:47] <sammich> horrible.
[07:52:02] <seutje> nah, too busy with the GTAs
[07:52:06] <seutje> which reminds me
[07:52:11] <sammich> I could use more adjectives, but it would mean spending more time about that movie that it was worth
[07:52:15] <Velveeta> krambiorix: $.get returns a deferred object, not the content
[07:52:39] <Velveeta> sammich: lol, i'll still watch it anyway :D
[07:52:42] <sammich> mmm, GTA
[07:52:49] <sammich> those sticky bombs are the...
[07:52:50] <sammich> bomb
[07:52:56] <krambiorix> Velveeta, how can i get the html from that deferred object then?
[07:53:22] <sammich> and it's $50 for a 20-pack RPG refill
[07:53:26] <sammich> I mean. Whoa.
[07:53:42] <Matix> Hi
[07:53:43] <sammich> .done()
[07:53:54] <Matix> how do you select an input text with name foo[bar] ?
[07:54:09] <Matix> $('[name=foo[bar]]') doesn't work
[07:54:19] <t432> I'm trying to submit this form with jquery, it would not submit with tags "action", "action" (submits with these tags removed) <form class="navbar-search pull-left" id="navbar-search" method="get" action="${selected}" >
[07:54:35] <sammich> $('[name="foo[bar]"]')
[07:55:11] <doug65536> sammich: if you need rpg money, just run over some people on the sidewalk and go back for the money
[07:55:26] <t432> anyone ideas?
[07:55:41] <sammich> I mean, $2.50 a grenade. Less than a cup of coffee
[07:55:54] <sammich> well, a coffee here, where I live, where it's like $4
[07:57:11] <Velveeta> krambiorix: deferred objects can be attached to with a .done function like sammich said, and inside that function is where you could get set the .html() of your container
[07:57:22] <Matix> ah, never mind
[07:57:27] <sammich> thanks for going into the detail :)
[07:57:29] <Matix> I was missing a ] :P
[07:59:51] <t432> I'm trying to submit this form with jquery, it would not submit with tags "action", "action" (submits with these tags removed) <form class="navbar-search pull-left" id="navbar-search" method="get" action="${selected}" >
[08:02:36] <Velveeta> t432: that's because action is supposed to be a url of some kind
[08:03:19] <t432> Velveeta: it is (using a framework tag)
[08:03:29] <t432> hang on let me get you a pastebin
[08:04:06] <doug65536> t432: it seems like you expect the action to magically change based on the "selection". is that right?
[08:05:08] <t432> this should help make some sense - http://pastebin.com/eRXvDfT2
[08:05:12] <doug65536> t432: at what point is the "selected" placeholder evaluated
[08:05:35] <t432> doug65536: line 1
[08:05:40] <t432> see pastebin
[08:06:22] <SprkDev> how do I add !important to my css with jquery?
[08:06:48] <sammich> you don't
[08:07:10] <doug65536> SprkDev: .css('display', 'none !important'); I think
[08:07:15] <sammich> that doesn't work
[08:07:33] <t432> Velveeta: get that?
[08:07:33] <sammich> attr('style', 'display:none !important') :D
[08:08:02] <doug65536> sammich: seriously? that's a very bad idea
[08:08:12] <sammich> notice the :D
[08:08:17] <doug65536> sammich: it will clobber all the existing styles on that element
[08:08:19] <doug65536> ok lol
[08:08:25] <Velveeta> that's some kind of custom tag… but where does it actually swap out the "action" attribute with that value?
[08:08:27] <sammich> well
[08:08:29] <sammich> not really
[08:08:39] <sammich> because, it's hidden :D
[08:08:45] <knevik> #yii
[08:09:37] <Ericx2x> hey guys I'm a bit confused my client wants me to add a google analytics tracking code to this website i'm working on
[08:09:51] <Ericx2x> he is linking me to the google docs
[08:10:01] <Ericx2x> google documentation*
[08:10:19] <Ericx2x> but i always thought adding a tracking code was as simple as copy and pasting javascript
[08:10:22] <t432> anyone?
[08:10:31] <Gmac_> can i use a selector like this in jquery $("[data='filter']")
[08:10:45] <sammich> yeah, but you don't want to do that
[08:10:52] <Gmac_> y not
[08:11:04] <sammich> it's expensive as it needs to visit every dom element on the page
[08:11:07] <wild_oscar> Ericx2x: pretty much
[08:11:32] <wild_oscar> it's as simple as copy-pasting the snippet provided by google analytics
[08:12:02] <Ericx2x> wild_oscar but then there is this part where my client says he wants to use parameters
[08:12:02] <Gmac_> so its better to select the $(' .class'').on('click….. and then i can use this.data('filter') to do stuff with it?
[08:12:11] <Ericx2x> something like this: <a href="#" onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Submit', 'eBluePromoCode', 'eBlueLandingPage']);">Play</a>
[08:12:17] <Ericx2x> i dont get why that needs to be there
[08:12:35] <knevik> Eric2x: Maybe your client wants to track the clicks done by the visitors
[08:12:51] <Ericx2x> clicks on what submitting a form?
[08:12:56] <Ericx2x> that is all there is on this website
[08:13:12] <wild_oscar> there are some more advanced analytics tools
[08:14:05] <Ericx2x> i'm so confused
[08:14:21] <Ericx2x> so i should copy and paste this analystics tracking code
[08:14:29] <Ericx2x> then on my for submit button i add some parameters?
[08:14:36] <Velveeta> ericx2x: how is this a jquery question?
[08:14:36] <Ericx2x> an on click parameter
[08:14:47] <wild_oscar> revisiting the event delegation question - on my original page I have a $('.someClass').each(function) to apply additional css
[08:14:57] <wild_oscar> (run on doc ready)
[08:15:17] <doug65536> SprkDev: it ain't pretty, but: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/vcXjG/
[08:15:39] <Velveeta> and t432: i asked you a followup question and never got an answer...
[08:15:39] <wild_oscar> how do I do the same for my reponse's contents, after adding them to the page?
[08:15:53] <t432> can you repeat it?
[08:16:09] <Velveeta> t432: that's some kind of custom tag… but where does it actually swap out the "action" attribute with that value?
[08:16:40] <wild_oscar> only way I'm seeing is making a function out of this, and calling the function on my success
[08:16:56] <wild_oscar> but am open to smarter ways of doing it
[08:17:05] <Ericx2x> Does it matter at all where you add in javascript for tracking codes?
[08:17:06] <t432> Velveeta: on submit (I think). Did tou see the pastebin?
[08:17:11] <Ericx2x> does it have to be in the head or body?
[08:17:45] <Velveeta> t432: yes, i saw the pastebin, but i don't see any submit handler in that code… i see you calling .submit() on the form, but there's no form submit handler to swap out that action attribute
[08:18:43] <t432> Velveeta: if i remove the both action, method tags, seems to submit just fine
[08:19:15] <Velveeta> t432: right, because at that point, the form has a valid action value to submit the form… the default is for it to submit to the current page
[08:19:36] <t432> i see, what do you suggest?
[08:19:39] <Velveeta> my guess is that it's choking on ${selected}
[08:19:51] <t432> i think so to.
[08:19:52] <Velveeta> well, i suggest putting something other than ${selected} into that action attribute
[08:19:53] <t432> too*
[08:20:10] <Velveeta> prior to submitting
[08:21:22] <t432> Velveeta: It's both action and method tags
[08:21:48] <t432> tried remving action tag only, had to remove both for the form to submit.
[08:21:49] <Velveeta> well method="get" is perfectly fine
[08:22:28] <t432> is there some other way to submit the form?
[08:24:10] <Velveeta> t432: it's probably just that action attribute, prior to calling .submit() on that form, try calling .attr('action', ui.item.label), like $('.navbar-search').attr('action', ui.item.label).submit()
[08:27:39] <t432> Velveeta: that line does submit, but it points to /tmp
[08:28:17] <t432> replaced:  $('.navbar-search').submit(); with $('.navbar-search').attr('action', ui.item.label).submit()
[08:28:19] <Velveeta> so….. i'm not exactly sure what you're trying to accomplish with that ${selected} attribute value, so what i gave you was a guess at the intent
[08:28:34] <t432> ok thx
[08:29:04] <t432> Velveeta: select attr points to a specifc handler in controller for the form
[08:29:10] <t432> "selected*
[08:30:00] <Velveeta> t432: remove the .attr() call you just put in, and instead, on the line before you .submit() the form, do a console.log($('.navbar-search').attr('action'));
[08:30:10] <Velveeta> and see what endpoint it's outputting in the console
[08:33:24] <t432> Velveeta: nothing displayed for ... $('.search-query').val(ui.item.label); console.log($('.navbar-search').attr('action')); $('#search-query').submit();
[08:34:29] <Velveeta> then the problem may be the the form *is* submitting, but to the current page, and just causing it to reload itself, rather than to your controller method
[08:34:36] <Richhh> anybody manage to get Google Closure Compiler to work with --ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS on an app that used jQuery?
[08:34:49] <Richhh> it broke my app in some places
[08:35:06] <Richhh> even with externs, --process_jquery_primitives etc
[08:35:21] <Richhh> (no etc)*
[08:35:53] <t432> Velveeta: its not submitting (it would refresh otherwise)
[08:35:55] <t432> nvm
[08:35:58] <Richhh> the basic setting pretty much only removed whitespace
[08:43:50] <wild_oscar> what's the best way to add a "loading" spinner next to the button on the ajax, while the request is being processed?
[08:44:13] <wild_oscar> adding it in the "beforeSend", and removing it in "complete"?
[08:44:15] <doug65536> wild_oscar: font-awesome has an animated spinner
[08:44:55] <doug65536> wild_oscar: imho, he's not kidding, font-awesome *is* awesome :)
[08:45:25] <eobet> does anyone know of a responsive bin packing grid?
[08:46:56] <wild_oscar> doug65536: it is! I haven't used it but...it's not animated, is it? I was tring trying <i class="icon-spinner"></i>
[08:46:59] <wild_oscar> *trying
[08:47:22] <doug65536> wild_oscar: I think you need an extra class name  on it... one sec
[08:47:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: how goes the plugin
[08:47:37] <wild_oscar> ah, icon-spin
[08:48:03] <wild_oscar> yup, it's icon-spin :D
[08:48:08] <doug65536> wild_oscar: yep
[08:48:26] <wild_oscar> but how would you go about and displaying it while ajax is loading?
[08:48:49] <wild_oscar> do you just add it in the beforeSend of the ajax function?
[08:49:26] <duch_kazatel> wild_oscar in any event, you'll need to add/show it on or before sending, and then hide it on success/error/etc.
[08:49:45] <wild_oscar> (someplace).append(<i "spinner>) / (someplace).siblings(spinner).toggle(hidden ?
[08:50:06] <doug65536> wild_oscar: or even just show it before the whole ajax call and hide it in complete
[08:50:28] <duch_kazatel> if the page is going to be doing a lot of ajax, i'd stick it in your markup and then toggle display: none; on it.
[08:50:31] <doug65536> wild_oscar: complete is always called, even on error
[08:51:53] <doug65536> wild_oscar: are you already doing a .closest? just use that with a .find('.icon-spin.icon-spinner').show() / .hide()
[08:52:26] <Velveeta> another technique i've seen is to just add a beforeSend and complete function in $.ajaxSetup that just adds a 'loading' class to the body, and in your css, just make a rule for body.loading { cursor: wait; }
[08:52:44] <Velveeta> and then there's no loading spinner involved anywhere, you just change the mouse cursor
[08:53:44] <t432_> sorry got disconnected
[08:54:02] <wild_oscar> doug65536: close; I'm trying $(this).siblings('.icon-spinner').toggleClass('hidden');
[08:55:13] <doug65536> wild_oscar: I stay away from toggleClass. you know what you want it to do, use addClass/removeClass
[08:55:20] <wild_oscar> Velveeta: that's close to something we used in the past - only instead of the cursor, we'd display a huge spinner on the top of the screen (with the rest of the screen blurred/greyed)
[08:55:48] <wild_oscar> doug65536: wise, yes
[08:56:09] <wild_oscar> nice. this is getting interesting :D
[08:56:17] <doug65536> wild_oscar: toggleClass is great when you have a true/false value, you pass that as the 2nd parameter and it adds/removes appropriately
[08:56:18] <Velveeta> wild_oscar: yeah, the problem with a white/blackout like that is that it prevents the user from doing anything else during the request… using a cursor shows that something is requesting, but doesn't prevent interaction otherwise
[08:56:40] <wild_oscar> Velveeta: I've learnt that usually you want that :P
[08:56:56] <wild_oscar> the less interaction, the less opportunity to screw up
[08:56:57] <wild_oscar> :P
[08:56:58] <Velveeta> i don't like to prevent user interaction unless it's critical
[08:58:11] <doug65536> wild_oscar: one principle I always try to follow: the user is the boss, he is in control
[08:58:15] <wild_oscar> doug65536: indeed; I've used the true/false parameter passing in one my 1st jquery functions, precisely to toggle classes
[08:58:54] <Velveeta> like if you have a grid of data loaded, and it's paginated, and each row has a button/link to delete a record, and they click to go to the next page… while that request is processing, you wouldn't want to disable the entire table, because they may still want to scroll and look at something while they wait, but you might disable the buttons so they can't click to delete something while the next page request is processing, that sort of
[08:58:55] <Velveeta> mentality
[08:59:54] <Velveeta> you typically want to limit the interface as little as possible, and otherwise, let them have free reign and make sure your code handles things separately, so they can't hose something that bleeds over into breaking something else
[09:00:16] <Velveeta> separation of concerns and all that, as true in ui components as it ever was in class architecture
[09:10:23] <krambiorix> how can i store data retrieved from an ajax request for future use ?
[09:11:20] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix when you call the ajax method, there's a success callback that you bass the data as an arg to - just assign a var to that data.
[09:11:45] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, ow ok thx!
[09:12:52] <duch_kazatel> so you'll have $.ajax({/* request funk here */}).success(function(requestedData){storedData = requestedData});
[09:13:20] <duch_kazatel> make sure you hoist up that var so it's available wherever you want to use it.
[09:14:19] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, yes, thanks again!
[09:14:40] <duch_kazatel> np.
[09:24:51] <jitt> can someone explain why .click doesnt work here http://www.codecademy.com/courses/web-beginner-en-v6phg/2/4 but I can use .click for buttons etc?
[09:25:33] <dustin_> how can I select those 3 distinct sets of div.a here? http://jsfiddle.net/8Jd38/6/
[09:26:13] <jedimind> .a { ... } ?
[09:26:34] <jedimind> individually or all together dustin_ ?
[09:27:01] <dustin_> 'div.a' is not what I'm going for
[09:27:13] <dustin_> but the list should contain only div.a items
[09:27:20] <dustin_> if that makes sense
[09:28:09] <jedimind> 3 selectors to select each of those 3 groups individually: $('div > div.a') $('div > p > div.a') $('body > div.a')
[09:28:23] <jedimind> also you cant put a div inside a paragraph
[09:28:25] <jedimind> :)
[09:28:36] <myosotis> I was hoping to do it in a way where I wouldn't need to know it's hierarchy
[09:28:47] <jedimind> so just div.a
[09:28:52] <myosotis> and that's why I try to html as little as possible in my job =)
[09:28:53] <jedimind> that'll select all of those
[09:29:03] <myosotis> I want them in 3 seperate lists
[09:29:08] <myosotis> only groups that are siblings of each other
[09:29:23] <jedimind> sorry im too hungry to try to understand what you mean
[09:29:28] <jedimind> i'll be back in a bit
[09:29:32] <myosotis> it's cool, I think I am too
[09:32:28] <myosotis> I can use 'div.a:not(div.a + div.a)' to select a list of the first element in each list, and use that to build my 3 lists
[09:35:25] <jax> can somebody give me a hand here? i'm trying to cal playToggle() but it aint working
[09:35:26] <jax> http://buildinternet.com/project/supersized/docs.html#api_docs
[09:35:35] <jax> i don't know how i have to reference it for the cal to wrk
[09:36:46] <jax> ah got it
[09:52:58] <defaultro> what's the ideal way to update the frontend if there were changes in the backend db?
[09:53:15] <defaultro> do we want to always poll the server via ajax via a timer?
[09:53:24] <NoiseEee> defaultro: you mean to display in 'real time' ?
[09:53:28] <defaultro> yes
[09:53:34] <defaultro> so that frontend will have the latest and greatest data
[09:53:36] <NoiseEee> defaultro: implementing something like socket.io
[09:53:48] <defaultro> ok, i've never heard of it. Sounds cool
[09:53:52] <defaultro> how does it work?
[09:54:07] <NoiseEee> it will use websockets for clients that can handle them, or institute polling for browsers that can't.  requires node.   www.socket.io
[09:54:17] <defaultro> is this nodeJs?
[09:54:22] <NoiseEee> the backend, yes
[09:54:26] <defaultro> ok
[09:54:39] <defaultro> so socket.io is the client?
[09:54:42] <defaultro> the library?
[09:54:53] <NoiseEee> library, used by both node and also clientside
[09:55:01] <defaultro> cool
[09:55:04] <NoiseEee> check out the site, google around, lots of info.
[09:55:05] <defaultro> I'll read up on it. Thanks
[09:55:08] <defaultro> i hope there is a demo

[10:48:34] <Libin> i am making an ajax call to the server , the data get processed and send the data  to the client, however i dont see the code being hit back on ajax call . here is my code
[10:48:35] <Libin> http://jsfiddle.net/dg82t/
[10:50:37] <Libin> anyone in here
[10:56:04] <Libin> i am making an ajax call to the server , the data get processed and send the data  to the client, however i dont see the code being hit back on ajax call . here is my code
[10:56:16] <Libin> http://jsfiddle.net/dg82t/
[11:03:47] <Ericx2x> Is HTML5 and XHTML installed in every browser?
[11:07:35] <Libin> Ericx2x; this should give u a brief outline on the support
[11:07:37] <Libin> http://html5test.com/
[11:10:14] <Libin> is no one else in this room today
[11:10:34] <blindMoe> people are here but most likely working
[11:10:35] <grafi>  b-ot is here
[11:10:58] <Libin> ohk
[11:11:43] <Libin> can someone please review a abit of ajaX CODE  for me. i am not getting the hit back on ajax after processing data in server
[11:11:52] <Libin> http://jsfiddle.net/dg82t/
[11:14:26] <KWhat_Work> How do I trigger $.ajax error?
[11:14:28] <shoky> Libin: first of all remove that first callback that just sets feedData
[11:14:56] <shoky> Libin: 2nd.. are you seeing any of those alerts?
[11:15:13] <Libin> no none of the alerts are coming
[11:15:19] <shoky> Libin: add an error handler
[11:15:26] <Libin> thats is not a callback, thats a parameter that i am passing
[11:15:34] <shoky> that is a callback
[11:15:47] <shoky> check your browser's devtools network tab to see what's up with the request
[11:15:50] <shoky> and the response
[11:16:14] <shoky> could be a parse error
[11:16:44] <Libin> ohh sorry
[11:16:47] <Libin>  u r right
[11:16:59] <Libin> i thought u were talkign about the service region
[11:18:43] <Libin> have removed the first call back
[11:18:47] <Libin> still no luck
[11:19:31] <shoky> then do the other things i said
[11:19:43] <Libin> error handler?
[11:19:54] <shoky> that's one of them, yes
[11:21:01] <shoky> also if your server is responding with an incorrect mimetype, you might need to set the dataType to 'json'  or just use .getJSON instead of .get
[11:21:17] <axscode> http://pastebin.com/Lh58Y23R <— hi guys in here, i would like to ask, why throb.removeClass('throb_o') is not removed while its the same element im trying to add and remove any pointers please?
[11:22:20] <shoky> axscode:  throb/throbe
[11:22:22] <NoiseEee> axscode: you've typo'd;   throb vs throbe
[11:22:36] <NoiseEee> beaten by a second :(  my life is meaningless
[11:23:10] * shoky throbes NoiseEee
[11:23:37] <NoiseEee> thank you

[11:30:51] <Aquaword> hm thats new for me, https://leanpub.com/practicallaravel
[11:32:59] <cnap> guys what is the best way to split a page in 2 parts for organization purposes. I want something simple, clean and nice
[11:33:10] <cnap> like split it in 2 blocks
[11:33:28] <Aquaword> sorry bad channel :)
[11:33:32] <axscode> thanks shoky.....
[11:33:48] <axscode> and NoiseEee :p
[11:33:49] <Cork> cnap: doesn't sound like something you should do through js
[11:34:10] <cnap> yeah I know but I found something like this: http://www.bramstein.com/projects/jlayout/
[11:34:14] <Cork> cnap: just use the server language of your choice and include partial files
[11:34:26] <cnap> and jquery is powerful.. so I thought there could be a nice plugin or something
[11:34:31] <cnap> I cannot use server side lang :)
[11:34:35] <cnap> I am doing a Spotify app
[11:34:41] <cnap> only HTML, JS and css
[11:36:56] <cnap> maybe im gonna try to use a css grid system or something
[11:39:20] <bberry> Does anyone here have any experience with Select2?

[11:56:41] <jonkristian> I'm using the twitter typeahead library to search for and add city, however i need to take the result from the search url and query a different url to get just the city name, see: http://gd.geobytes.com/AutoCompleteCity?callback=?&q=corona and to get geobytescity i need to query http://gd.geobytes.com/GetCityDetails?callback=?&fqcn=Corona%20del%20mar,%20CA,%20United%20States
[11:57:37] <jonkristian> My code for now, which doesn't work: http://pastie.org/8375628

[12:01:59] <crivera> can anyone tell me which trigger www.icloud.com is using on the Password field to enable the right arrow?
[12:02:12] <crivera> keypress, change, focus aren't working
[12:02:56] <jedimind> crivera its nothing to do with the password field
[12:02:57] <jedimind> its either or
[12:03:09] <jedimind> it porbably just has an event to check if youve entered something in both fields
[12:03:11] <jedimind> then enables it
[12:03:33] <jedimind> also thats the most horribly written html markup ever
[12:03:48] <jedimind> its not even a <button> like a real form, its a series of 3 images with binded events
[12:03:55] <jedimind> so dont really do it that way
[12:04:17] <crivera> :)
[12:04:20] <crivera> thanks jedimind
[12:04:32] <jedimind> the checkbox is a series of 8 images

[12:06:21] <doug65536> jedimind: forget the markup. what's that awful blurry crap in the background :|
[12:16:44] <doug65536> crivera: also, see if you can get your login form to finish initializing in under 3500ms
[12:17:20] <grafi> oO
[12:33:26] <bricker> Hello - can anybody see why this isn't working? It just has a completely empty responseText, no error messages, nothing ... it just runs the error callback. Visting the endpoint in a browser works fine. http://jsfiddle.net/nyCkg/1/
[12:34:30] <jedimind> cross domain policy?
[12:34:46] <bricker> jedimind: that's what I would guess, but I never see any errors regarding that.
[12:40:30] <shoky> bricker: when trying with the actual url that includes the ?url=...  i do see the cross domain error
[12:42:06] <bricker> shoky: arg... I was trying it without the / before the ?
[12:42:08] <shoky> never understood why that error doesn't show up anywhere in the network tab..
[12:42:17] <bricker> that is so lame
[12:43:13] <raj> should I just load the .css file for my jquery plugin in a separate line in the html <head>?
[12:43:18] <raj> or should I load it via js?
[12:45:14] <shoky> separate line works well
[12:45:23] <Kambfhase> Random non-jQ question: Does anyone know a good lib for cross-iframe communikation?
[12:45:55] <doug65536> raj: depends on if it looks bad for the stuff to not be styled momentarily at page load
[12:48:08] <raj> I can't do it before document ready?
[12:48:16] <raj> ok, but I see what you're saying
[12:48:25] <raj> regular <head> load it is
[12:48:35] <raj> thank you doug65536
[12:48:42] <doug65536> raj: adding it to head will just make it asynchronously load it
[12:48:50] <doug65536> raj: adding it IN JS to head will just make it asynchronously load it
[12:48:54] <raj> shoky, you're slacking
[12:54:17] <shoky> on phone ;p
[12:56:21] <Soopaman> i can;t remember, but is there a cost for prototype extending native objects? ala Date.prototype.fName = ...
[12:57:30] <doug65536> yes, the cost is you become an ass. please never extend an object you didn't create
[12:59:20] <boytoy> lol
[12:59:48] <snover> says the guy that is in the channel about jQuery, the library that is extended by…oh…extending an object you didn’t create
[13:01:01] <Soopaman> doug65536: unless you have something to actually contribute, please troll elsewhere
[13:01:15] <Ximerian> is there a way to have .datepicker not blank the current value of the field it's attached to?
[13:01:32] <AlexMax> Is there a channel for JQuery UI?
[13:01:36] <AlexMax> or can I ask in here
[13:02:07] <doug65536> here
[13:03:09] <AlexMax> I am running jQuery UI 1.8.13 and I am having a very peculiar problem.  I have a page that I have applied datepickers to that works great in every single browser except IE8
[13:03:38] <grafi> even in ie6 and 7?
[13:03:39] <grafi> :P
[13:03:52] <AlexMax> have not tested 7 or 6
[13:03:52] <doug65536> Soopaman: ignored
[13:04:06] <grafi> there you have it
[13:04:24] <AlexMax> On IE8, the datepicker is actually applied, but that is the very last thing that happened on the page....it's like the page stops loading
[13:04:55] <AlexMax> It works fine if I use compatibility mode
[13:05:25] <nicetry> Hey guys -  Lets say I have a link which onclick - calls a javascript function (this is not done via jquery by the way, its shitty legacy code which I have to live with).   Now lets also say I cannot change any of the params of the function.  Is there any way for that function to figure out who called? (find the <a> tag in the dom)
[13:06:22] <AlexMax> If I comment out the datepicker application, the page loads fine
[13:06:32] <AlexMax> There are no errors in the console
[13:08:03] <Lorcat> If there is no class named tutorial and I run this statement if ($(".tutorial")) will it return false? What about vice versa?
[13:08:33] <doug65536> Lorcat: it will always be true, no matter what
[13:08:46] <doug65536> Lorcat: use if ($('.tutorial').length)
[13:09:14] <Lorcat> doug65536: Thanks.
[13:10:16] <grafi> AlexMax so its basically just the datepicker that breaks the page?
[13:17:02] <doug65536> nicetry: for debugging? or in production code?
[13:17:33] <nicetry> doug65536: debugging for now
[13:17:56] <doug65536> nicetry: if for debugging, you can hook the $.fn.find function
[13:18:23] <nicetry> how do you mean, hook?
[13:18:49] <doug65536> var oldfind = $.fn.find; $.fn.find = function() { ...do stuff...;  return oldfind.apply(this, arguments); }
[13:19:43] <doug65536> nicetry: one of the parameters is 'selector', and you can iterate the selector with this.each(function() { ... })
[13:20:25] <nicetry> hmmm doesn't sound like what I'm looking for - but thanks... I think I'm trying to make something work that by all rights should be 100% borkd
[13:21:49] <s2013> im using select2 and i get an error that says Uncaught TypeError: Object #units_select has no method 'select2'
[13:22:00] <s2013> but in the console if i type $('#units_select').select2(); it works
[13:25:51] <nicetry> doug65536: I got something, but I can't tell if its the worst or just kinda bad
[13:25:53] <nicetry> jQuery(document).click(function(event) { window.lastElementClicked = event.target; });
[13:26:31] <nicetry> s2013: run the debugger before that error happens, and see if select2 is available at that point in the code execution
[13:26:50] <s2013> how do i do that? it happens as soon as i load hte page
[13:28:29] <nicetry> s2013: what browser are you using?
[13:28:34] <s2013> chrome
[13:29:13] <nicetry> in the error console it should give you the line number where there bug occured, which is also a link to that part of the code
[13:29:33] <nicetry> Click it, then go up a few lines from it and set a breakpoint on the left hand side by clicking on the numbers
[13:29:44] <nicetry> when you refresh the page, it should stop at that breakpoint
[13:29:45] <s2013> yeah i know. i only have 1 line basically
[13:29:55] <s2013> $('#units_select').select2();
[13:30:06] <s2013> i mean i also hav edocument ready but as far as actual code goes
[13:30:26] * nicetry is confused
[13:30:45] <s2013> http://paste.ubuntu.com/6189751/
[13:31:14] <s2013> im guessing its cause users.js is being loaded before the jquery?
[13:31:43] <s2013> nevermind jqueyr is being loaded first
[13:31:57] <nicetry> ...it is?
[13:32:07] <s2013> yup
[13:32:36] <AlexMax> grafi: yeah, if I don't use the datepicker, the page loads ifne
[13:32:37] <nicetry> can you paste your code thats giving rise to this?
[13:32:44] <AlexMax> but i don't use jquery ui in a whole lot of the page
[13:34:25] <s2013> nicetry,  i pasted it. check in the ubuntu paste
[13:34:53] <nicetry> I did... that didn't look like the whole thing
[13:35:02] <nicetry> grab the source of your page and paste it
[13:36:32] <s2013> https://gist.github.com/ss2k/2e35041c63e6e1533473 nicetry
[13:38:48] <DeltaHeavy> Why does $($) make my whole Chrome tab so messed up it can't even close?
[13:39:04] <AlexMax> holla for dolla
[13:39:17] <doug65536> DeltaHeavy: it isn't difficult to hang a tab in chrome
[13:39:44] <nicetry> s2013: looks like you are calling users.js before you have an #units_select element on the page
[13:40:01] <s2013> how do i fix that?
[13:40:07] <s2013> put it in th footer?
[13:40:13] <s2013> but i thought we didnt have to do that anymore
[13:40:38] <AlexMax> DeltaHeavy: RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[13:41:17] <nicetry> I don't think you _have_ to do anything, but I don't think putting JS at the bottom of a page has fallen out of best-practices (unless I'm sadly out of date)
[13:41:40] <nicetry> Aside from that - you can't select something with jquery that doesn't exist yet. Simple as that.
[13:41:43] <s2013> from what i read recently that it doesnt matter anymore. but i could be wrong
[13:41:47] <s2013> so how would i fix it?
[13:42:26] <nicetry> put any JS that requires page elements to exist at the bottom of your page before the </body> tag
[13:42:38] <doug65536> putting your script at the bottom makes it impossible for you to do initialization steps - you must then setup the initial state of the html so the appropriate things are hidden etc. not a best practice to me
[13:43:01] <doug65536> who cares if it takes an extra 50ms or so
[13:43:38] <doug65536> the time-to-ready is the same - so what if they see the page content 3 monitor refreshes sooner
[13:43:49] <s2013> ok. thanks
[13:44:40] <DeltaHeavy> Does it really matter where you put them if you're using document.ready?
[13:45:06] <s2013> thats what i was wondering
[13:45:30] <nicetry> apparently
[13:45:37] <nicetry> well, I don't know - try it out
[13:46:09] <s2013> k thanks
[13:49:23] <doug65536> DeltaHeavy: yes it makes a difference, if that's what you're asking. if you load it in head, you can setup the initial state of things in js. if you load at the bottom, they will be displayed before your js runs
[13:49:55] <DeltaHeavy> Doesn't most JS load async now though, so it's best to put it at the top?
[13:51:02] <nicetry> Wouldn't you want your site to degrade gracefully without js? (support for lynx, screen readers...etc...)
[13:51:17] <DeltaHeavy> People who use lynx can screw themselves I'm sorry :p
[13:51:18] <doug65536> sure it loads async, but it runs it before it lets the page appear. the difference is small. I think the very brief display delay is better than having the page appear wrong for a split second
[13:52:09] <nicetry> Im pretty sure all js is still run on a single thread, thats why css animations are favored now over javascript
[13:52:31] <doug65536> nicetry: did I say it runs it async?
[13:53:27] <nicetry> Nope, maybe we're talking about different things, I'm talking about running, you're talking about loading
[13:53:32] <doug65536> DeltaHeavy: links is great when you have screwed up your display driver and you are booted to a text terminal
[13:53:57] <doug65536> DeltaHeavy: lynx is obsolete - replaced by links
[13:54:20] <nicetry> the future is here! links!
[13:54:36] <doug65536> DeltaHeavy: so if your site isn't a howto for people with messed up linux display drivers, you'll be fine :)
[13:54:52] <nicetry> its been fun, g'night guys
[13:55:59] <doug65536> try the amd site in links. it's a disaster
[13:57:56] <tom__> With jQuery, I can create an HTML element like this: $("<p/>"). I have a function which requires that in flat serialized HTML text form. How can I convert $("<p/>") to "<p/>"? I like using the jQuery API to build it because it's nicer than string concat.
[13:58:31] <doug65536> tom__: you mean, get the raw html from a document fragment? I use .prop('outerHTML')
[13:58:35] <s2013> putting it in the bottom isnt helping either. damn it
[13:58:36] <doug65536> I would use *
[13:58:57] <tom__> doug65536: sounds like that should work, I will try it. Thanks.
[13:59:00] <doug65536> s2013: helping what
[13:59:13] <s2013> nvm
[13:59:14] <s2013> got it
[13:59:14] <tom__> doug65536: perfect, thanks man
[13:59:20] <tom__> back to work now
[14:00:35] <DeltaHeavy> doug65536: Yeah, links even has JS. But yeah, honestly I'm not going to spend the time making sure my site works on text based browsers. Not enough people to use them for me to care about them.
[14:00:38] <AlexMax> doug65536: You are mistaken
[14:00:59] <AlexMax> lynx 2.8.8dev.16 came out two months ago
[14:01:00] <doug65536> AlexMax: about what
[14:01:22] <DeltaHeavy> AlexMax: It's still maintained, but obsolete.
[14:02:04] <AlexMax> I think i tmerely has a different feature set that it supports
[14:02:37] <AlexMax> by your standard, firefox obsoletes elinks because it has full support for the latest web standards
[14:02:58] <AlexMax> Having a different scope of features does not make it obsolete
[14:04:08] <DeltaHeavy> No, it's not a "different feature set". Lynx supports no modern web technologies, not even JS. links however does. It supports a LOT LOT more than lynx.
[14:04:37] <DeltaHeavy> Also we're talking about CLI browsers, not comparing them to GUI ones.
[14:06:01] <boytoy> If the dropdown is so big it flows out of the page, split it into [fluid] columns and move the overflowing links into those new columns: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/WzWHL/25/
[14:06:04] <boytoy> But at lines 32-37, how do I measure the combined width of all the new columns and set it on the dropdown? (got some CSS positioning issues if I don't do it this way)
[14:09:24] <boytoy> Seems to be falling a *bit* short
[14:11:43] <AlexMax> IDK, I kind of like lynx's navigation, how it doesn't even attempt to do layouts
[14:12:16] <DeltaHeavy> Nothing wrong with using obsolete stuff if it still serves your purposes well.
[14:13:13] <AlexMax> on the other hand
[14:13:15] <AlexMax> w3m
[14:13:41] <DeltaHeavy> Never heard of it, I don't touch text based browsers almost ever.
[14:13:54] <AlexMax> i'm kind of biased
[14:14:01] <AlexMax> lynx was the first web browser i ever used
[14:14:41] <AlexMax> "feh, this web stuff is boring.  FTP is better, i can download commander keen with it!!!!!111"
[14:14:46] <boytoy> lynx is beautiful :D
[14:14:58] <boytoy> great for emergency situations
[14:15:03] <AlexMax> dial up shells
[14:15:05] <AlexMax> those were the days
[14:15:09] <boytoy> hehe
[14:15:11] <DeltaHeavy> boytoy: Try out 'links' IMO
[14:15:18] <AlexMax> i don't get links vs elinks
[14:15:20] <boytoy> yup
[14:15:22] <AlexMax> i thought elinks was the successor
[14:15:27] <AlexMax> but links is more often updated?
[14:15:30] <boytoy> w3m too
[14:15:39] <boytoy> thats my go-to one
[14:15:48] <AlexMax> w3m is useful as an html-enabled pager
[14:15:54] <AlexMax> if you need to read html output
[14:15:59] <AlexMax> from curl or something
[14:16:09] <DeltaHeavy> Never used elinks
[14:16:20] <DeltaHeavy> Or w3m
[14:16:42] <boytoy> AlexMax: true i remember i had a case like that
[14:17:09] <boytoy> AlexMax: arent text-based browsers really good for checking ones website's accessibility once it's fully developed?
[14:17:32] <DeltaHeavy> boytoy: It's better to just disable CSS/JS in your browser IMO
[14:17:44] <boytoy> DeltaHeavy: yeah good point..
[14:17:55] <boytoy> might as well might as well =)
[14:22:08] <boytoy> ngharo: incase you get this, i added some code to set a final fixed width on our dropdowns to avoid potential display issues: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/WzWHL/28/
[14:22:57] <boytoy> ngharo: i also changed var idx to var itemIndex and var i to var item to make things a bit sexier, let me know what you think. i think it's pretty damn gorgeous thats what i think =)
[14:25:51] * hexed is gone: idle 30 minutes [2:25pm]
[14:33:10] <ngharo> boytoy: noice :]
[14:34:41] <DiegoViane> Hi, how can i connect with a database using javascript?
[14:35:39] <myosotis> are you talking about html5 local database stuff, or something like sql server or mysql?
[14:36:32] <DiegoViane> i´m actually learnin html5, but i need to connect to a sql server or mysql
[14:36:39] <boytoy> ngharo: oh yes indeedie-o my man :D
[14:36:57] <Xander1> is there a way to pass multidimensional in ajax?
[14:37:18] <myosotis> you will have to write some server side code to do your database access and return the information to an ajax request.
[14:37:44] <Xander1> i run .each function and i see in the log that multidimensional array does get created, but when i look in DB what comes in POST - there's nothing
[14:39:16] <DiegoViane> this server side code can be writed in js or must be in php for example?
[14:39:35] <bradmaxs> I am having trouble accessing a variable outside of an .each() loop. Is it because it is within a function? http://jsfiddle.net/CxnKn/
[14:40:24] <shoky> DiegoViane: it can be in js if you have a js backend server like node.js
[14:40:43] <myosotis> bradmaxs, yes, define it outside of your each loop
[14:41:50] <shoky> bradmaxs: that won't be enough.. the .each loop and the code after it is finished way before the .onload is called
[14:42:36] <myosotis> indeed, there are logic errors
[14:43:00] <myosotis> test image_url_array length instead
[14:43:13] <DiegoViane> ok, so i'll learn node.js
[14:43:52] <DiegoViane> thanks for now!
[14:43:53] <bradmaxs> myosotis: ok.  I want to send a message if there are no images sent back to the server.  Yes, the logic sucks.  Rewriting the logic as I go.  It's a beast.
[14:43:56] <doug65536> DiegoViane: do you have a private server? shared hosting providers typically won't let you use node
[14:44:21] <DiegoViane> its a private server
[14:46:06] <DeltaHeavy> DiegoViane: You'll have to use a framework on top of node.js. By default it act like a webserver. It's pretty different in comparison to just hooking up PHP to Apache.
[14:46:49] <doug65536> DeltaHeavy: what he wants is a webserver - to serve ajax requests that query the database - I think
[14:48:30] <bradmaxs> myosotis: I want to get the value of the remaining images after the loop has discarded the ones that are too small so I can't use the image_url_array because it contains all the images.
[14:49:58] <bradmaxs> shoky: any idea how to work around this?
[14:50:07] <doug65536> DeltaHeavy: nothing forces you to make a server in node, you can do whatever. there's no reason to call http.createServer or anything
[14:50:29] <DeltaHeavy> doug65536: I thought he wanted general server side scripting. Didn't know it was JUST AJAX.
[14:51:37] <doug65536> DeltaHeavy: I used node enough to become familiar. I'm not an expert in it by any means. I really like it though
[14:51:56] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, it's good. I'd really only use it for certain things though.
[14:51:59] <myosotis> then wait until the images have been loaded to run your code
[14:54:01] <DiegoViane> I just want do measure the best way to build my system.
[14:54:11] <bradmaxs> myosotis: ok.  I'll try that.
[14:54:26] <DiegoViane> Im looking for the easyest way to connect to database
[14:54:50] <myosotis> DiegoViane, probably using something like php would be the easiest way
[14:54:57] <neeky> why does this not work? http://jsfiddle.net/nikmartin/ubf38/
[14:55:02] <doug65536> DiegoViane: it doesn't get a lot easier than php
[14:55:13] <neeky> DiegoViane, A nice REST interface works well
[14:55:43] <neeky> i use .data() in several places, but it doesnt here
[14:55:48] <doug65536> DiegoViane: although, I do miss perl DBI API. way cleaner than mysqli etc
[14:56:35] <neeky> can I not do .each against a class, and then do .data on each element?
[14:56:56] <neeky> each iteration
[14:57:39] <doug65536> neeky: because 'e' is a raw DOM element. you need $(e).data
[14:57:51] <neeky> ah, screw me, thanks
[14:58:11] <neeky> been staring at that for 20 minutes
[14:58:33] <neeky> thinking that since jQuery handed e to me, I could just operate on it directly
[14:58:54] <myosotis> neeky, http://jsfiddle.net/bxzuT/1/
[14:58:56] <doug65536> neeky: yeah, jquery rarely, if ever, wraps stuff for you. you get used to it
[14:59:46] <neeky> i had tried this too, bu kept getting the Backbone View, for the same reason :)
[15:00:15] <neeky> $(this) != this
[15:01:06] <neeky> also times and dates suck on html forms
[15:01:26] <doug65536> neeky: dates don't suck. html5 has support for dates
[15:01:47] <doug65536> neeky: if you do it wrong, it won't work
[15:01:57] <neeky> yeah, but when you need toi allow a user to key in a time and a date, and THEN turn that into a Date object
[15:02:16] <doug65536> neeky: that isn't difficult
[15:02:25] <cnap> Is there any better time picker than this: http://jonthornton.github.io/jquery-timepicker/ around?
[15:02:33] <cnap> I think this is ugly :S
[15:02:33] <neeky> chrome, ie, firefox, and mobiles handle type="date||time" differently
[15:03:03] <doug65536> neeky: in what respect? user experience?
[15:03:22] <neeky> yes, and IE just treats date and time like text
[15:03:48] <neeky> chrome pops up a shitty date picker, and the time is not 24h it makes you pick AM/PM
[15:03:59] <doug65536> neeky: are you sure? that would be awfully non-standards-compliant
[15:04:10] <neeky> 99.9999% sure
[15:04:40] <neeky> my app is very time and date sensitive, and it is the bane of my existence right now
[15:04:41] <doug65536> neeky: can you try something for me? $('#someDateInput').val('1997-03-10')
[15:04:59] <doug65536> neeky: that should work perfectly if the browser is even slightly html5
[15:05:26] <doug65536> neeky: if type="date" I mean
[15:05:27] <neeky> no, the .val is fine, it's the UX that sucks
[15:05:46] <neeky> the user experience on IE is a text input
[15:05:52] <doug65536> neeky: no, what I'm saying is, it should convert that to the current locale's date format
[15:06:00] <doug65536> I hope anyway
[15:06:20] <neeky> yeah, dates are pretty ok, time is just text
[15:06:24] <Xander1> not sure if im doing this right, but how can i pass multidimensional array through $.ajax - https://gist.github.com/albertpak/17c09d8ad14641f24832
[15:06:43] <doug65536> neeky: sure, if you stuff some crap that isn't a proper html5 format, sure maybe it will just set the raw text. but if you follow html5 standard and assign yyyy-mm-dd it should do the right thing
[15:07:29] <neeky> so I have to do $('#date').val + ' ' $('#time').val then cast that into a date object and cross my fingers
[15:08:23] <doug65536> neeky: my mistake. I guess you're already convinced. why do I care
[15:08:52] <neeky> I'm just ranting right now, it'll be ok, I'm just purturbed at the amount of work i'm doing just to get idiot-proof dates and times from a user
[15:09:01] <shoky> Xander1: if you want to send JSON then set contentType: 'json'  and you'll need to parse the JSON on your server
[15:09:12] <doug65536> neeky: try this in IE plz http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/2s6Xe/
[15:09:21] <neeky> ok hang on
[15:09:36] * neeky is on linux with a VM for windows
[15:09:44] <doug65536> neeky: so am I
[15:10:26] <shoky> Xander1: er sorry, contentType: 'application/json'  or something
[15:10:32] <neeky> like i said, times are my main kicker right now
[15:10:44] <neeky> dates have been pretty ok
[15:10:51] <doug65536> neeky: yeah, IE is a steaming pile of feces
[15:11:12] <neeky> even on chrome, time is hokey
[15:11:40] <doug65536> I guess with their scientific notation bank balance, they can't afford to pay a dev to read the html5 spec
[15:11:48] <neeky> I cant get a 24 hour input mask, which is what the customers live by
[15:11:57] <neeky> herh
[15:12:19] * neeky is still booting
[15:12:37] <Xander1> @shoky sorry, where do i set that?
[15:12:52] <doug65536> neeky: way past you. unfortunately, IE10 shows 1997-03-10 in the input field. chrome does the right thing
[15:12:56] <shoky> Xander1: in the $.ajax options.  but you'll still need your server to know to parse the JSON
[15:13:06] <neeky> there you go
[15:13:26] <neeky> third party plugins are my saving grace for dates, times I'm just screwed on
[15:13:35] <doug65536> neeky: does your code have to be locale sensitive?
[15:13:36] <Xander1> @shoky even though im already setting dataType: "json"
[15:14:04] <shoky> Xander1: dataType is for the expected _response_ data type.  contentType is for the sent _request_ data
[15:14:24] <neeky> doug65536, i store all dates as Date objects, and have to display them in the user's locale
[15:14:32] <neeky> with TZ correct, etc
[15:14:43] <neeky> BUT users want 24 hour time
[15:14:50] <doug65536> neeky: date.toLocaleString is a start
[15:14:53] <Xander1> @shoky - just tried settng it, still empty
[15:14:55] <neeky> which for some bizarre reason is driven by locale
[15:15:00] <doug65536> neeky: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleString?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal_Objects%2FDate%2FtoLocaleString
[15:15:12] <shoky> Xander1: you need to parse the JSON on your server. also "empty" is not a good error description
[15:15:44] <doug65536> neeky: or just use a library, like moment.js
[15:16:55] <doug65536> neeky: moment.js is date/time processing taken to the ridiculous level. the (huge) international script supports everything but star trek stardates afaik
[15:17:04] <neeky> ok, your fiddle did squat on IE
[15:17:19] <neeky> yeah, I looked at moment, it's probably time to use it
[15:17:39] <doug65536> neeky: yes, IE10 is utterly, hopelessly broken. jquery doesn't work. you need to set the jquery version to the git daily build (edge version)
[15:18:29] <neeky> works better, but not great
[15:18:34] <doug65536> neeky: I haven't bothered to check but it may work if you load jquery from the same domain
[15:19:00] <neeky> im not running it from a cdn on my ste, jq is local
[15:19:14] <Xander1> @shoky im looking at what comes through $_POST - and in DB it's empty as in it looks like this: a:0:{}, yet when i look at my console.log - it looks like this: [{"profilefieldname":"fasdfasdf","field_type":"text"},{"profilefieldname":"fasdfasdf","field_type":"text"}]
[15:20:25] <shoky> Xander1: you're not sending form data so $_POST won't work
[15:20:43] <doug65536> neeky: I wish web devs would/could just let IE be broken, instead of catering to that piece of garbage. I can dream, right?
[15:20:46] <Xander1> @shoky - what do you suggest?
[15:20:49] <shoky> Xander1: if you want to send it as form data so you can keep using $_POST then i'll change your code a bit to do that, sec
[15:21:09] <boytoy> doug65536: lol
[15:21:09] <shoky> Xander1: or you could figure out how to parse the request body in php - i have no idea about that
[15:21:44] <boytoy> i just deny them access to my page, simple as that
[15:21:59] <boytoy> they account for what, 0.5%?
[15:22:22] <neeky> i wish
[15:22:23] <shoky> er where did he go
[16:06:17] <nhulea> Is there any reason why a ajax submit would work on ff chrome ie 8 9 but not on ie 10
[16:06:32] <nhulea> oops *not wqork*
[16:06:35] <nhulea> work
[16:06:47] <duch_kazatel> wait what?
[16:07:17] <nhulea> I created a form and there were a few people who said it wouldnt submit ? ie 10
[16:07:32] <duch_kazatel> and no errors?
[16:07:42] <nhulea> not for me and I can get it to work on ie10
[16:07:59] <duch_kazatel> should be good then.
[16:08:07] <nhulea> could it be there internet or something ?
[16:08:12] <nhulea> their
[16:08:17] <duch_kazatel> maybe security zone issues?
[16:08:29] <duch_kazatel> are you posting the form to a different domain/port/subdomain?
[16:08:31] <nhulea> ok I guess 99 % working is good
[16:08:36] <nhulea> no
[16:09:03] <duch_kazatel> i'd see why it's failing for them, but it should work just fine.
[16:09:35] <nhulea> yeah they click the submit button and nothing happens
[16:09:43] <nhulea> but I ve never had it do that
[16:09:56] <duch_kazatel> i'd have them open the console and show any erors.
[16:10:07] <nhulea> f12
[16:10:15] <duch_kazatel> then click console
[16:10:16] <duch_kazatel> yup
[16:10:22] <nhulea> ok
[16:10:34] <nhulea> its ie only to so that atleast narrows it dow
[16:10:36] <nhulea> n
[16:23:55] <boytoy> If the dropdown is so big it flows out of the page, split it into columns and move the overflowing links into those columns (so the entire dropdown is visible on the page): http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/WzWHL/30
[16:23:59] <boytoy> But how come it gets the height wrong once I give its links some padding? http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/WzWHL/34/
[16:24:11] <boytoy> lol.. just had to dismantle my entire app just to find out it was the padding :p
[16:25:32] <boytoy> ah outerHeight! ofcourse
[16:43:33] <ChaZ> hi everyone!
[16:45:12] <ChaZ> can someone help me with an advice?
[16:47:52] <duch_kazatel> ChaZ just ask.
[16:48:21] <ChaZ> hey duch_kazatel
[16:48:37] <ProLoser> hallo
[16:48:44] <ProLoser> anyone here use jquery layout?
[16:49:05] <duch_kazatel> ChaZ what's your question?
[16:49:38] <ChaZ> duch_kazatel I'm writing it :) One sec, please
[16:50:30] <ChaZ> I want to retrieve some JSON data by using $.ajax. The URL of the JSON is something like http://domain.org/data=category1,category2
[16:50:59] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[16:51:45] <ChaZ> The question: How can I dinamically modify the categories? I think it would be ok to use checkboxes, but I can't think how to apply the changes to the url
[16:52:13] <duch_kazatel> ChaZ you can pass a variable to the data property for $.ajax()
[16:54:12] <ChaZ> You mean like: var1 = category1, var2=category2 ?
[16:54:40] <duch_kazatel> err, no.
[16:54:41] <duch_kazatel> one se.
[16:54:42] <duch_kazatel> *sec.
[16:55:13] <ChaZ> ok
[16:57:11] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/sBf93/
[16:57:13] <duch_kazatel> you can do that.
[16:57:22] <duch_kazatel> so you set queryString to whatever you want beforehand
[16:58:20] <ChaZ> let me check that :)
[18:16:11] <hlve> sup guys?
[18:17:18] <cadz> hi anyone here?
[18:20:16] <hlve> Anybody know of any css3 or jQuery plugins that recreate the genie effect (the minimize/open animation on mac)?
[18:20:43] <cadz> hi maybe one of you knows how to fix my issue,   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19171600/how-to-clear-the-data-from-ajax-without-reloading-the-page?noredirect=1#comment28362792_19171600
[18:25:06] <MrTrick> I've got a set of requests to make, that either succeed (200), fail because of invalid client parameters (400), or possible have some other kind of error (401, 403, 5xx).
[18:25:42] <MrTrick> How can I set up a promise that resolves after *all* requests have finished with 200 or 400, or rejects if another kind of error is returned for any?
[18:26:24] <MrTrick> ($.when won't quite work, I think)
[18:33:19] <chrisferrill> #phonegap
[18:44:02] <shoky> MrTrick: you can do it with $.when and some custom deferred
[18:44:45] <MrTrick> shoky: I thought so... like to come up with a handler that converts 400s into a different kind of resolved promise.
[18:45:33] <shoky> you can return a resolved deferred in .then
[18:45:38] <shoky> sec
[18:45:49] <MrTrick> So with $.ajax('foo').then( donehandlr, failhandlr), Can failhandlr return a resolved deferred ?
[18:46:27] <shoky> yes
[18:46:28] <MrTrick> so that for $.ajax("foo").then(null, failhandlr).done( donehandlr ) , donehandlr will be called if failhandlr resolves?
[18:46:33] <MrTrick> interesting. :-)
[18:46:52] <shoky> something like this  http://jsfiddle.net/sdNZG/1/
[18:48:29] <hlve> shoky, you are a wizard.
[18:48:40] <coldhead> amen
[18:48:45] <shoky> i've got the sleeves to prove it
[18:48:48] <hlve> http://www.exponentcms.org/files/WIZARD12.GIF !
[18:48:56] <hlve> minus the nose of course.
[18:49:10] <shoky> i'd honk that nose
[18:50:45] <coldhead> ew
[18:55:44] <MrTrick> thanks shoky.
[19:10:45] <jcrawford> guys i was in here the other day and recieved some help with some indeterminite checkboxes, everything is working smooth however I now have to add another checkbox which will work a bit differently.  Here is the working fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/8ZQ5p/
[19:11:50] <jcrawford> basically when you click on any of the checkboxes in the column the header checkbox is either checked, unchecked or indeterminite state.  The issue now is that when you check any one of those checkboxes in the column the inform corresponding author checkbox must get checked.  This checkbox should also uncheck when no column checks are checked.
[19:12:16] <jcrawford> I have been trying to get this to work but i cannot seem to get it to work. the closest i can get is to get the checkbox to check, and uncheck but then it wont continue the cycle
[19:13:47] <jcrawford> http://jsfiddle.net/8ZQ5p/ that's with my work in place, as you cna see if you check the header checkbox the corresponding author checkbox checks as well, if you uncheck the header the corresponding unchecks, but if you click the header again the corresponding does nothing'
[19:15:24] <doug65536> jcrawford: I remember
[19:15:39] <jcrawford> doug65536: yes it was you who were assisting with this
[19:15:54] <jcrawford> i understand the code now, just not quite sure why i cannot get this secondary checkbox integrated
[19:17:22] <jcrawford> oh and i did that codeschool jquery thing, got most of the answers right without even watching the videos lol
[19:17:40] <jcrawford> doug65536: would you have a moment to try to assist me with coming to a solution with this?
[19:17:50] <doug65536> jcrawford: sure
[19:18:29] <`poindexter`> $(".coresponding-notice", table).find('input[type=checkbox]');
[19:18:44] <doug65536> jcrawford: .prop, not .attr http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8ZQ5p/1/
[19:18:46] <`poindexter`> you have no elements with that classname
[19:18:52] <`poindexter`> nvm
[19:18:53] <`poindexter`> im blind
[19:18:55] <`poindexter`> LoL
[19:19:40] <doug65536> jcrawford: aw, still other issue though..
[19:20:13] <jcrawford> yea i cannot uncheck the inform checkbox if i wanted to lol
[19:20:37] <jcrawford> i changed the attr to prop, looking at your code vs mine dont see the difference
[19:22:58] <jcrawford> i could add a class of checkbox to the corresponding checkbox so long as it didn't mess up the rest
[19:27:08] <`poindexter`> jcrawford: http://jsfiddle.net/8ZQ5p/
[19:27:39] <`poindexter`> mhmm
[19:28:07] <jcrawford> `poindexter`: nope.. as soon as you uncheck 1 checkbox the corresponding is unchecked, that needs to check as soon as 1 checkbox is checked and only uncheck if no checkboxes are checked
[19:28:18] <jcrawford> also should be able to manually uncheck/check it if necessary
[19:29:18] <jcrawford> brb phone call, will respond to anything said asap
[19:29:42] <`poindexter`> well, not completely true… you can select a few of them then unselect them (it will only unselect when the last one's unchecked)
[19:30:17] <doug65536> jcrawford: found one issue, you are using 'table' before it is computed
[19:30:59] <doug65536> jcrawford: I think I got it http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8ZQ5p/4/
[19:31:04] <jcrawford> Doug moving that be
[19:31:04] <jcrawford> ow table fixed the issue with the code but still an issue
[19:31:04] <jcrawford> even moving that
[19:31:25] <doug65536> jcrawford: try it
[19:31:48] <jcrawford> checking'
[19:32:08] <`poindexter`> worked for me
[19:32:22] <jcrawford> perfect now i need to digest this code to figure out why yours works and mine doesn't
[19:33:15] <doug65536> jcrawford: I'll tell you why: you were using 'table' as the scope before any value was assigned. you passed 'undefined' as the scope when you selected .coresponding-notice. that is the same as not having any 2nd parameter. therefore, you got every corresponding notice on the page
[19:33:26] <doug65536> jcrawford: also, you were using attr when you needed to use prop
[19:34:16] <doug65536> jcrawford: I changed the .find to a more efficient selector - no real change there, just slightly more efficient on modern browsers
[19:34:30] <jcrawford> Doug butw even after changing that mine still would not work
[19:34:52] <doug65536> jcrawford: mine works for you right?
[19:35:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: wus happening
[19:35:05] <jcrawford> I moved the corresponding thing to be below the table define and then changed attr to prop but mine was still not working properly, yes yours is working perfectly fine
[19:35:23] <doug65536> jcrawford: are you sure you got all the .attr?
[19:35:25] <jcrawford> just trying to understand why... can you diff 2 fiddles?
[19:35:39] <doug65536> I can manually
[19:36:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> ugh
[19:36:05] <i8igmac> Rohan_Bhangui: still converting a bunch of trailers
[19:36:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> nice
[19:36:26] <doug65536> jcrawford: I mean, manually run a command line diff tool
[19:36:40] <jcrawford> ahh wait mine works like yours except still one issue
[19:36:52] <jcrawford> try to check or uncheck the corresponding box manually it doesnt act accordingly
[19:36:55] <i8igmac> i only get a few hours a day to think ab out this stuff
[19:37:01] <jcrawford> i thought yours had fixed that but it hadnt
[19:37:22] <doug65536> jcrawford: what is checking the corresponding box supposed to do?
[19:37:33] <jcrawford> this was mine: http://jsfiddle.net/8ZQ5p/5/ and yours http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8ZQ5p/4/
[19:37:47] <doug65536> jcrawford: I noticed that right away - it seemed like intended behavior
[19:37:50] <jcrawford> gives the admin a way to say no we definitely don't want to send this email to the corresponding author
[19:37:54] <jcrawford> for edge cases
[19:38:30] <doug65536> jcrawford: meaning, allow the user to uncheck it, but preserve the checking behavior?
[19:38:42] <jcrawford> correct
[19:38:59] <jcrawford> or they should be able to check it if no others are checked
[19:39:40] <jcrawford> I think it has something to do with how the on change works because it's only looking for checks wth class of checkbox
[19:40:50] <jcrawford> now that I have gone throughout the code school training I am going to dig into the other things you suggested, been spending a ll my free time on that lol
[19:41:34] <doug65536> jcrawford: this is closer http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8ZQ5p/7/
[19:41:50] <doug65536> jcrawford: should they be allowed to check it when none of the others are checked?
[19:42:31] <jcrawford> Doug yes they should
[19:42:48] <jcrawford> this UI is horrible I know lol
[19:42:59] <doug65536> jcrawford: ok, so that should be it then, it is now as intended, right?
[19:43:25] <jcrawford> walking to the computer to check, indeterminate doesn't work on the iPad one sec
[19:43:48] <doug65536> jcrawford: yeah, nothing "works" in safari :P
[19:44:13] <doug65536> jcrawford: you should look at caniuse.com. safari supports hardly anything :)
[19:44:31] <jcrawford> doug65536: that's working perfect
[19:44:43] <jcrawford> yea i told my boss about this not working on mobile devices not even in chrome
[19:44:53] <jcrawford> he's ok with it as the fallback is to just uncheck the header checkbox
[19:44:57] <jcrawford> but this is working perfect
[19:45:02] <jcrawford> now to digest what you changes
[19:45:04] <jcrawford> *changed
[19:45:46] <jcrawford> ah i see basically if they click the corresponding author checkbox the jquery function returns without doing anything else
[19:45:46] <doug65536> jcrawford: I just made it return early if the parent of what changed has class coresponding-notice
[19:46:02] <jcrawford> i never would have thought of doing that
[19:46:14] <jcrawford> man i really have to wrap my head around all of this :D
[19:46:30] <jcrawford> doug65536: your a lifesaver once again, TYVM
[19:46:35] <doug65536> jcrawford: you're doing fine. this markup is pretty complicated
[19:46:37] <doug65536> np
[19:46:49] <jcrawford> yea this UI is just horrible IMO
[19:46:57] <jcrawford> they forced the layouts on me ugh
[19:47:30] <jcrawford> told them this entire system needs a complete overhaul, need to rewrite the entire UI, need to rewrite the entire codebase...
[19:47:36] <jcrawford> doug65536: you familiar with PHP at all?
[19:50:59] <jcrawford> the way they have this app setup is a base page class, then subclasses which are pages of their own.  Each page class has a make() function which will output HTML markup ugh, nothing worse than PHP and markup all mashed together lol
[19:52:18] <doug65536> jcrawford: yes
[19:53:09] <doug65536> jcrawford: tell me they aren't using echo and string concatenation
[19:53:54] <jcrawford> tons of that and tons of output buffering too
[19:54:01] <raj> doug65536, how did yo ucome up with $container.append($('.my-el').sort(...))?
[19:54:09] <raj> really genious
[19:54:12] <jcrawford> oh and they have one page say prod.php which handles the output for about 5 different pages based on query paramaeters lol
[19:54:32] <doug65536> raj: na. thanks though
[19:54:54] <raj> i mean it, how did you know that would work?
[19:55:01] <jcrawford> oh and the database layer don't get me started on that.  They are using MyISAM but have FK support in code I think the dev was just afraid of cascade delete lol
[19:55:29] <raj> you new sort was returning each item 1 at a time?
[19:55:33] <raj> *knew
[19:55:48] <raj> i dunno, i see how that makes sense, but I just wouldn't have thought of that
[19:56:12] <jcrawford> doug65536: is a very bright individual, i didn;'t think of half the things he just helped me out with lol
[19:56:38] <raj> oh, or .append takes an array
[19:56:58] <raj> very cool, again, wouldn't have considerd that
[19:57:03] <doug65536> raj: because $.fn.sort is the native Append sort
[19:57:08] <doug65536> Array sort*
[19:57:16] <raj> yup
[19:57:18] <shoky> .append takes a lot of things
[19:57:28] <raj> I actually thought we were using the native sort
[19:58:06] <doug65536> raj: and a jquery selector is "array-like". it is similar enough to a real array that it would work
[19:58:18] <raj> ya
[19:58:24] <raj> which is why I thought we were using the native .sort
[19:59:02] <doug65536> raj: that's all a jquery selector really is anyway, an array of DOM elements
[19:59:24] <raj> ya
[19:59:59] <doug65536> jcrawford: there are few real reasons not to use InnoDB
[20:00:19] <doug65536> jcrawford: myisam has some extremely non-standard "tricks" you can do
[20:00:31] <jcrawford> doug65536: sure but his reasoning was fear nothing more lol
[20:00:38] <MrTrick> heh, "tricks".

[20:01:27] <jcrawford> nice
[20:01:42] <doug65536> MrTrick: exactly
[20:01:54] <jcrawford> thanks again doug65536, gotta get back to work on this blah code now :)  much appreciated
[20:02:01] <doug65536> jcrawford: np
[20:04:32] <jcrawford> doug65536: did you see that pastie i noticed over to you?
[20:05:30] <doug65536> jcrawford: no
[20:05:39] <jcrawford> oh sec
[20:05:55] <jcrawford> will notice it again now
[20:07:13] <jcrawford> i PM'd it notices are crashing Linkinus for some odd reason
[21:12:27] <jennifer_> 100 billion ++
[21:21:55] <wookiehangover> hmmm jquery-ui custom downloads seem to be not werking
[21:22:48] <kborchers> wookiehangover: crap again?
[21:23:07] <wookiehangover> yeup, seems to be not-doing-much
[21:23:18] <wookiehangover> regardless of wats selected
[21:24:11] <kborchers> there is some service that keeps hanging up on that box and i don't have access or don't know how ;) to bounce it
[21:24:16] <kborchers> gnarf: around? ^^
[21:24:58] <wookiehangover> kborchers: I figured someone would know what was up
[21:27:05] <kborchers> wookiehangover: thanks for pointing it out … if it's not fixed tonight i imagine it will happen pretty early tomorrow
[21:27:27] <wookiehangover> can I make a custom build with the grunt file?
[21:32:48] <jcrawford> ugh doug you have one more moment
[21:32:53] <jcrawford> doug65536
[22:18:54] <doug65536> jcrawford: yes
[22:21:59] <martisj> I'm trying to debug what I believe to be a js glitch but I can't reproduce the bug locally. I've checked out the same version as the server and tested but no dice. Any ideas?
[22:22:22] <martisj> Every time I try to add a person to a group on our site they can get added multiple times.
[22:22:26] <martisj> Which is not exactly ideal
[22:36:36] <martisj> now i've even got the same DB
[22:36:55] <regedit> say i have an event handler function that creates a var 'foo', then i proceed to make an ajax call and chain some deferred .done/.fail/etc functions to it. if i mention some 'foo' in these latter functions, will they refer to the same 'foo' as above in the code?
[22:37:28] <doug65536> regedit: if the foo is in a function under the scope of foo, yes
[22:37:37] <doug65536> is accessed in*
[22:37:37] <regedit> doug65536: in that case,
[22:38:49] <regedit> doug65536: what if this event handler is called multiple times, and the response from the ajax calls can happen out of order. will each instance of the .done/.fail magically refer to the right version of their scope's 'foo'?
[22:39:04] <regedit> or will things get messed up
[22:39:18] <doug65536> regedit: it will work right
[22:39:23] <regedit> wow really
[22:39:25] <regedit> how come
[22:39:37] <doug65536> regedit: closures are amazing
[22:39:43] <regedit> interesting...
[22:40:02] <doug65536> regedit: I'd have to see a code snippet to verify that what you have is what I think you have
[22:41:21] <doug65536> regedit: if it's .on(... function() { var xx = ...; $.ajax(...).done(function() { var yy = xx + 1; ... })        <-- will work perfectly
[22:41:56] <LLckfan> Is there a way to make a house smell better without openng windows?
[22:42:12] <doug65536> LLckfan: clean up :)
[22:43:16] <regedit> doug65536: as in - even when 'xx' has different value per each triggering of the event, each .done() will turn up its own correct expected version of 'xx' ?
[22:44:05] <doug65536> regedit: every time it invokes the anonymous function (callback), it will create a new 'xx' (assuming it is declared with 'var', so yes, it has no choice but to have separate xx's
[22:44:14] <regedit> LLckfan: ear plugs, they fit in your nostrills
[22:45:11] <doug65536> regedit: the .done(function()  is right there in the event handler right?
[22:45:33] <regedit> doug65536: ye that much i did expect, but i was doubtful as to whether unordered invocations of .done() would clobber alternate 'xx's
[22:45:36] <regedit> doug65536: yup
[22:45:43] <regedit> as in your snippet
[22:46:22] <doug65536> regedit: if your variable has 'var' then it is local to that function invocation, so when it creates the function closure, it will capture the xx that is in scope at that moment, which will be "that" xx
[22:47:17] <regedit> who maintains this closure / where does this closure exist waiting around until the ajax response happens?
[22:47:37] <LLckfan> no
[22:47:51] <doug65536> regedit: when it "evaluates" (not executes) the function you pass to done, it keeps a reference to that variable
[22:48:20] <doug65536> regedit: js is garbage collected. it keeps track of what data has references to it automatically
[22:48:27] <regedit> i see ok
[22:48:32] <doug65536> regedit: don't think in C. there is no stack frame
[22:48:43] <regedit> heh ok
[22:51:16] <doug65536> regedit: if you want a mental model for it, imagine that it "adds a reference" to that xx when you "evaluate" (not execute) the function you pass to done. done is then holding a reference to that function closure, which is holding a reference to that xx. when the ajax is done, the reference to that function closure gets released, which releases the reference to that xx captured by the closure
[22:51:54] <regedit> and each event has its own copy of all of the above, i presume?
[22:52:51] <doug65536> regedit: yes, variables in js are function scope, so any variables that are declared with 'var' are new variables. closures capture the variable in scope when it "evaluates" the function. so yes, they will be separate
[22:52:58] <glosoli> Any ideas for how one could validate input fields to accept only numbers or other stuff based on regex ?
[22:53:32] <regedit> doug65536: mkay thanks much for the explanations
[22:53:58] <boytoy> At http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/WzWHL/37/ (dropdown menu columnizer) -- how come the part that sets fixed widths for the columns (lines 60 and 65) only apply to the first menu and not the second?
[22:54:42] <boytoy> * lines 60 to 65
[23:00:32] <doug65536> boytoy: because by the time it gets to the second pass of the each on line 145, it's not visible anymore, so the if body doesn't run
[23:02:38] <doug65536> boytoy: I mean, it is visible, so the 2nd pass's if (!$this.visible()) { ... } stuff doesn't run
[23:04:08] <doug65536> boytoy: 'visible' tests whether it is visible - meaning - not offscreen. did you mean .is(':hidden') ?
[23:05:35] <doug65536> boytoy: where did you find the .visible() function anyway? it's not documented
[23:06:25] <boytoy> dear doug65536: my bad that function was actually suppose to be outside the visible thingie
[23:06:55] <boytoy> man.. i dont know why i didnt see that.. (lack of sleep probably)
[23:07:08] <boytoy> thank you.. oh yeah the visible thing
[23:07:38] <boytoy> doug65536: https://github.com/teamdf/jquery-visible this one..
[23:07:48] <doug65536> boytoy: ah, a plugin. that explains it
[23:09:29] <boytoy> yep
[23:10:13] <boytoy> doug65536: ought not this do the trick? http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/WzWHL/41/
[23:10:42] <boytoy> you  mentioned something about cached selectors earlier, i must admit i did not read up on that so
[23:13:29] <doug65536> boytoy: you can't get the width or height or position of something that isn't displayed
[23:13:43] <boytoy> doug65536: aaah you're right!
[23:15:00] <boytoy> doug65536: makes sense, on the second iteration the panel would be hidden so it wouldnt know what to do.. moved the panel hide out of the each and lo and behold..
[23:15:56] <doug65536> boytoy: yeah, that behavior is annoying but it helps performance a lot. the browser can pretend it doesn't even exist if it is display: none. and if it doesn't even exist, it has no position, size, etc
[23:16:31] <doug65536> well, the layout engine can pretend it doesn't exist anyway
[23:16:48] <doug65536> and the layout engine is what figures out position, size, etc
[23:17:42] <boytoy> oh so its because of performance its like that.. well.. healthy compromise at least =)
[23:18:50] <doug65536> yeah, even with those speed-hacks, reflow is still a performance kill. they need to strip it down as much as they can get away with
[23:19:15] <doug65536> the spec says to behave that way anyway, to promote fast layout
[23:19:40] <boytoy> yes indeed
[23:20:08] <boytoy> doug65536: i guess it doesnt matter much for normal pcs but for older mobile phones i guess it can have quite an impact?
[23:20:32] <boytoy> older mobile phones which the majority of the non-internet world is now coming online with :P
[23:20:57] <boytoy> definitely gotta cater to those folks..
[23:29:07] <LLckfan> Is there a way to make a house smell better without openng windows?
[23:31:15] <doug65536> LLckfan: candles
[23:33:54] <becom33> if we use html like $('#changeme').html('<p>I just changed it </p>'); how can we get the default html inside the changeme back ?
[23:34:20] <Cork> becom33: store it before you replace it
[23:47:20] <Baluse> hello
[23:47:26] <Baluse> http://d.simple.com.gr/hello-world/feed.html
[23:47:32] <Baluse> if you click save at left
[23:48:08] <Baluse> with more buttons it is slow at clicking at a atom notebook
[23:52:57] <jphase> Baluse: what do you mean by atom notebook?
