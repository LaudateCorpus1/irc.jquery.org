[19:21:06] <Media_Thor> Please advise on parsing json to an array please: {"files": ["s3://bucket/path/to/file1,crazyname-here[boo]", "file2"]}
[19:21:40] <robertmaxrees> Media_Thor what are you hoping to wind up with?
[19:22:35] <Media_Thor> a varaible array ${var[1]}="s3://bucket/path/to/file1,crazyname-here[boo]"
[19:23:17] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:23:29] <Media_Thor> a varaible array ${var[0]}="s3://bucket/path/to/file1,crazyname-here[boo]"
[19:23:53] <Media_Thor> and ${var[1]}="file2"
[19:24:11] <robertmaxrees> what is ${var[0]} supposed to be?
[19:24:26] <robertmaxrees> are you just looking for var to be an array of the files?
[19:25:30] <Media_Thor> yes a bash array
[19:25:52] <robertmaxrees> oh - haha this is for a DOM js library :)
[19:26:02] <robertmaxrees> not the cmd line parsing tool.
[19:26:47] <Media_Thor> got it ))
