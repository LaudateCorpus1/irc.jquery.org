[00:06:52] <devi8> Hello?
[00:07:01] <robertmaxrees> people are around ;)
[00:07:50] <devi8> Is there a way to exit out of a $.fn.each loop?
[00:08:10] <devi8> or is there a better method to use to search until you find the first match?
[00:08:23] <robertmaxrees> you just want the first thing that matches?
[00:08:25] <robertmaxrees> filter it.
[00:08:42] <devi8> filter will still run through every item, right?
[00:09:04] <robertmaxrees> it can, and then you just .eq(0) or w/e
[00:09:16] <robertmaxrees> are you dealing with an array or a jquery object?
[00:09:40] <robertmaxrees> also: why are you so concerned with exiting early or w/e?
[00:09:46] <devi8> right. I have 10,000 phone records in <div> elements
[00:09:54] <devi8> for one of 5 clients
[00:10:24] <robertmaxrees> and what are you going to do with those?
[00:10:31] <devi8> I need to find a string in all of those pages of phone records quickly. So I can filter with regex, but I want to stop filtering once I find the first result
[00:10:57] <robertmaxrees> are you seeing performance issues already?
[00:11:12] <robertmaxrees> and if so, are you sure it's because of the filtering operation?
[00:11:29] <devi8> No, i'm still evaluating the best or easiest way to do it.  that was my next question
[00:12:05] <robertmaxrees> don't worry about performance quite yet.  in fact, 9/10 in a case like that the DOM operations are what get you.
[00:12:30] <devi8> awesome. thanks as always.
[00:12:32] <robertmaxrees> though now I have to ask: if client-side performance is such a big concern, why not implement server-side search instead?
[00:12:45] <devi8> Not my data.
[00:12:53] <robertmaxrees> ?
[00:13:04] <robertmaxrees> are you building a browser plugin or something?
[00:13:07] <devi8> I am pulling the data for an attorney off the DAs site. They are complete assholes about how they deliver the data
[00:13:27] <robertmaxrees> so doing an ajax request for it?
[00:13:39] <devi8> We just won a lawsuit because they tried using a proprietory non-searchable format for the data they were getting in tables
[00:14:21] <robertmaxrees> because depending, i might do a single lookup, store the data in an array, and then operate on the array instead.
[00:15:02] <devi8> That would be great, but here is the deal. Attorneys suck. And specially older ones. Trying to get them to understand or let you do something is a pain
[00:15:12] <robertmaxrees> i'm not arguing any of that.
[00:15:19] <devi8> So when I saw the list he had on his screen I realized that I could at least grab the html
[00:15:43] <devi8> then I was evluating if I should do it clientside or pull it into a text editor and filter it.,
[00:16:09] <robertmaxrees> so this is a 1 time job kind of thing?
[00:16:12] <robertmaxrees> just to nab the data?
[00:16:40] <devi8> While this is one case, I'm trying to figure out how to show him it can be easily done.
[00:16:52] <devi8> Because it could be a lot more cases
[00:17:13] <robertmaxrees> but this is just to grab the data from the page, right?
[00:17:13] <devi8> And these guys pay 800/month for a subscriptyion to Lexus Nexus that they don't use.
[00:17:29] <devi8> basically yes.
[00:17:30] <robertmaxrees> not for general public consumption?
[00:18:06] <devi8> nope. Passwords and shit.
[00:18:18] <robertmaxrees> sec
[00:19:43] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xLgzer4n/
[00:19:49] <robertmaxrees> easy enough to scrape data.
[00:21:09] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xLgzer4n/3/ against 1,000 divs
[00:21:27] <devi8> It;s much uglier than that, but yeah. That's the part I know. I'll filter using a regexp to get the really weird number they use for a unique call identifier
[00:21:50] <robertmaxrees> so don't use jquery's filter here.
[00:22:02] <robertmaxrees> unless you actually need the dom node for some reason.
[00:22:24] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise, simple operations like this are super simple with native filtering and whatnot.
[00:22:33] <devi8> but map iterates through all the elements as well, right?
[00:23:08] <robertmaxrees> do you need a reference back to the dom node?
[00:23:36] <devi8> yeah. And just the first match. After that will be a conversation, so I can then extract the conversation
[00:23:42] <robertmaxrees> okay so
[00:24:03] <robertmaxrees> the $.fn.map use there (with that .get() on the end) is just to get the data into a native js array.
[00:24:23] <robertmaxrees> then you do whatever youw ant against that array and it'll be relatively quick.  filter, find, whatever.
[00:24:32] <robertmaxrees> but get out of jquery/dom land for stuff like this.
[00:25:10] <devi8> good point. I wasn't thinking like that. it makes total sense though.
[00:25:15] <devi8> thank you
[00:27:14] <robertmaxrees> :) so unless you need a reference back to the element, https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xLgzer4n/8/
[00:27:21] <robertmaxrees> ezpz.
[00:27:41] <robertmaxrees> (that's naive code but illustrates the point)
[00:27:54] <devi8> speaking of DOM searching, when you do var x=$(sel).each(function(i, elem) {   does $(elem) search the dom again? what about $(this)?
[00:28:20] <robertmaxrees> so that var x = there is totally irrelevant fwiw.
[00:29:09] <robertmaxrees> as for your question, $(elem) vs $(this) do the same thing there - 'this' is set to 'elem'.  jquery recognizes you're passing in a DOM node and doesn't search the DOM again.
[00:30:20] <devi8> right on. good to know. I told someone that everytime you used $() it queried the dom and I was incorrect. Thanks
[00:30:32] <robertmaxrees> there IS a perf cost thoigh.
[00:30:35] <robertmaxrees> *though
[00:30:43] <robertmaxrees> $() runs the jquery constructor again.
[00:30:57] <robertmaxrees> which creates a new jquery object, which can eat memory real quick.
[00:31:07] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter in most cases, but situations like this...
[00:32:06] <robertmaxrees> also: for future reference, I might consider picking up Python with Beautiful Soup - really awesome for stuff like this.
[00:32:51] <devi8> Python with Beautiful soup...right on. I'll check it out. Is beautful soup an architecture o r is that the title of a book? lol
[00:33:25] <robertmaxrees> lol it's a library for parsing markup.  it even handles poorly formed stuff pretty well.
[00:34:01] <devi8> oh I need this for my plex server... excellent, thanks.
[00:34:11] <robertmaxrees> https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/ - from the very top of the page: "You didn't write that awful page. You're just trying to get some data out of it. Beautiful Soup is here to help. Since 2004, it's been saving programmers hours or days of work on quick-turnaround screen scraping projects."
[00:36:10] <devi8> excellent, thanks
[04:47:03] <bertdj> hi, I'm moving from v1 to v3.2; I'm wondering if anyone here can help me with this:
[04:47:13] <bertdj> we used to use: $('#pickerCanvas .artikel').live('click',function()
[04:47:20] <bertdj> I changed this to: $('#pickerCanvas').on('click','.artikel',function()
[04:47:25] <bertdj> but it doesn't work, unfortunately
[05:16:20] <bertdj> I decided to go with this, to fix the issue: $('body').live('click','#pickerCanvas .artikel',function()
[06:59:43] <Cork> wow... .live() in 2019...
[07:10:55] <FilipNortic_> yeah and here I got kind of flustered yesterday when they werel using bind...
[07:22:57] <Cork> lol
[08:37:58] <jquery865> Hey, is there an easy way to add 1 to a data value? like $(this).data("x", "+=1") or something
[08:38:33] <Cork> jquery865: $(this).data().x+=1
[08:38:51] <jquery865> thank you
[08:39:08] <Cork> np
[08:57:23] <Xolem> Hi everyone
[09:04:48] <Xolem> Can someone take a look at this Fiddle and explain me why caching in variables doesn't works and break code? http://jsfiddle.net/2L69qj4n/
[09:04:55] <Xolem> Thanks :)
[09:12:06] <jquery865> I don't seem to get it working, anyone mind taking a quick look at my code to see what I'm doing wrong http://jsfiddle.net/3zL1uhma/
[09:13:53] <Woet> jquery865: where is your debug code?
[09:15:40] <jquery865> sorry, what do you mean
[09:16:17] <Woet> jquery865: add some console.log statements to see what's going on
[09:16:37] <Woet> jquery865: check which lines of codes are reached at which times. check whether it ever reaches the "else" code
[09:17:33] <jquery865> oh right, I will. I've been not thinking well today it seems.
[09:18:18] <Woet> jquery865: hint: it never reaches your "else".
[09:21:24] <FilipNortic_> jquery865: your data undefied chewck is wrong
[09:23:40] <FilipNortic_> it's really, really strange... can't event begin to figure out what you want to do there...
[09:23:43] <FilipNortic_> do you have a div with id="x" and a data-x attribute?
[09:28:12] <jquery865> Wow, I've been super messy. I'm sorry. I'll just try to debug it myself else I'll do it some ugly way
[09:28:37] <Xolem> Can someone take a look at this Fiddle and explain me why caching in variables doesn't works and break code? http://jsfiddle.net/2L69qj4n/
[09:29:03] <Xolem> Or is my selector too long?
[09:29:28] <jquery865> @filipnortic_ @woet thanks, got it working. wasn't thinking straight
[09:30:43] <FilipNortic_> Xolem: I highly doubt that anybody can guess what that even means, you have to make a better example
[09:31:26] <FilipNortic_> it's not even working peace of code 2 else if blocks
[09:31:51] <Woet> Xolem: please create an actual test case with HTML/CSS (as required) that demonstrates the issue.
[09:36:19] <Xolem> I was just wondering why putting a big selector in a variable is not working while using directly the same selector works. I have seen that multiple call to the same selector is bad, but trying to put it in variable fails so... I just don't get it.
[09:36:50] <Woet> Xolem: there's no such thing as "selector is too long"
[09:37:04] <Woet> Xolem: if you'd give us a test case, you'd see that what you're saying is not true.
[09:38:44] <FilipNortic_> he is saying that saving a "long" selector to a varoble doen't work for him?
[09:38:50] <FilipNortic_> variable*
[09:39:07] <FilipNortic_> well, that's nothing I ever heard of
[09:40:14] <FilipNortic_> Xolem: try and put console.log statments after your variabloe so you can see what in there, odds are your scope is wrong
[09:43:57] <Xolem> Ok i'll try one sec
[09:45:21] <Xolem> Doing a full html/css/jquery fiddle will not be possible it would take me the full day, I already barely understand anything I do ... :(
[09:51:14] <Xolem> Well the variable in console contains the selector and works on first pass : problem is that first upload should show another upload item and it doesn't. It doesn without variable. Weird asf
[09:51:14] <thafdwes> hi, I don't know where to find any documentation on how to use @requestmapping, all the search results seem to be from stackoverflow where people presuppose that everyone already knows how to use them.
[09:51:44] <Xolem> it does without variable*
[09:53:30] <FilipNortic_> Xolem: the selctors are chached there not reevaluated
[09:55:06] <Xolem> So i'm breaking the logic somewhere because I don't reparse the whole DOM? hate working on code made by people 1000 times better than me. It's like floating in the ocean looking for a ship
[09:56:30] <Xolem> I will leave it like that. If it's not broken don't fix it right? Thanks guys :)
[09:56:33] <FilipNortic_> Xolem: when you save the result of a selecor to a varaible and then change the DOM... then the values saved in the varible no longer reflects what the same selector would return in that moiment....
[09:58:19] <FilipNortic_> thafdwes: requestmapping is not jQuery
[09:59:26] <FilipNortic_> it's most likely serverside code in some framework to get a http access point
[09:59:58] <thafdwes> FilipNortic_: ah okay, well I keep getting:XML Parsing Error: syntax error Location: http://[2001:470:b09a:e990:a884:8908:69d3:b802]/v1 Line Number 1, Column 1
[10:00:21] <Xolem> @FilipNortic_ Ok, still don't get it but it's not your fault, I have one day js and 2 days jquery experience and I have to change logic in a million line project. It's just too much for me. Hopefully i'll get it one day
[10:01:09] <Woet> Xolem: so spend more time learning jQuery before tackling a massive project.
[10:01:31] <thafdwes> on stackoverflow they said the solution was to set the contentType to "application/json" which I did but seems same result
[10:01:33] <FilipNortic_> Xolem: it like if you take a photo of a bunch of trees then cut some down, then expecting the photo to change with it
[10:01:47] <Xolem> If only I could, you are from the USA right? We are dying in Europe... time is a luxury we don't have
[10:02:36] <Xolem> But of course learning before doing should be the way to go, you are right
[10:02:43] <Woet> Xolem: I'm not. good luck tho!
[10:03:33] <FilipNortic_> that's more like comapny culutre... trial by fire is one thing but learning by fire isn't a good thing usally
[10:12:00] <Xolem> The company is mine, site must be live in 6 month, and I must be out of my continent that looks like a giant asylum in 5 years maximum otherwise i will get insane :'(
[10:12:54] <Xolem> I will just leave the multiple same selector as they are, the dev that made it probably know better than me anyways :)
[10:13:40] <Xolem> Thanks FilipNortic_ & Woet
[10:19:51] <Xolem> By the way someone gave me an explanation I understand better. It seems you can't use cached selectors if you are modifing anything in DOM with it
[10:22:35] <FilipNortic_> thafdwes: ok  so you have an ajax/get/post request. Just look a the request in the browser-console and see what content is returned?
[10:27:01] <thafdwes> FilipNortic_: I don't really understand what's going on, cause when I use curl to test it, works just fine, but with JQuery I get nothing
[10:27:52] <thafdwes> it return error code 400 from the jquery, and 200 from the curl
[10:29:02] <thafdwes> here is my js http://[2001:470:b09a:e990:a884:8908:69d3:b802]/js/login.js
[10:30:24] <FilipNortic_> 400 blank is ba request
[10:31:33] <FilipNortic_> and if your returning js there is a getScript function in jQuery
[10:32:31] <thafdwes> okay, well can you see why it's a bad request?
[10:32:54] <FilipNortic_> no I can't access your js
[10:33:25] <thafdwes> oh, weird. hmmm, should I put it in a pastebin?
[10:33:35] <FilipNortic_> Are you working cross domain?
[10:34:30] <FilipNortic_> thafdwes:  Unless it's really big use jsfiddle
[10:36:22] <thafdwes> no it is same domain
[10:37:05] <thafdwes> http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=64IcCsdTPe
[10:44:19] <thafdwes> is there any way I can see what it's outputting?
[10:45:28] <FilipNortic_> thafdwes: http://jsfiddle.net/Ly74hxz5/
[10:45:37] <FilipNortic_> this would be more normal
[10:47:03] <bestdesign> hi all
[10:47:09] <bestdesign> how to detect if a form empty?
[10:47:18] <bestdesign> i mean input field
[10:48:12] <FilipNortic_> $('input[val==""]')
[10:48:27] <FilipNortic_> value not val
[10:48:38] <ChkDigit> or $("#inputid").val() == ''
[10:49:34] <bestdesign> thank you! :)
[10:51:02] <bestdesign> still a question please, what about logical order for .blur vs .focus? something like .keypress. .keyup and .keydown?
[10:51:23] <bestdesign> how can understand the logical order in chain with jquery?
[10:52:10] <FilipNortic_> that not jQuery it general js
[10:52:45] <FilipNortic_> generaly it's used for when an input field is beeing selected (focus) and when you leave it (blur)
[10:52:46] <bestdesign> well i got that like i need to play with .val and .is
[10:52:49] <bestdesign> to work in a form
[10:53:30] <bestdesign> like .val() = "" is not work only before .is(':invalid')
[10:54:13] <FilipNortic_> val() returns the value of an elemnt
[10:54:20] <FilipNortic_> not a jQuery object
[10:55:05] <ChkDigit> And to set, you'd use .val("")
[10:55:26] <bestdesign> (this).val() == '') <--- only work if there have before (this).is(':invalid'))
[10:55:26] <thafdwes> FilipNortic_: okay I'll try that
[10:55:42] <bestdesign> i mean if change the order that way not can display val empty message
[10:55:44] <FilipNortic_> .focus(), .keyup, keydown...etc is short for .on('focus') and put an event on the elment it's called on
[10:56:04] <FilipNortic_> bestdesign: so you have to check the docs
[10:56:21] <FilipNortic_> if the returntype is selecor then you can chain it
[10:57:29] <bestdesign> well thanks.
[10:58:21] <bestdesign> still a question :P  if use fadeOut and a callback fadeIn how can set delay for it without remove the line and add the line?
[10:58:40] <bestdesign> .delay(200; is break the line
[10:58:47] <bestdesign> .delay(200);
[10:59:16] <bestdesign> oh got an idea :D
[10:59:23] <bestdesign> setTimeout
[10:59:33] <thafdwes> FilipNortic_: awesome thanks it worked ! :-D
[11:00:18] <FilipNortic_> thafdwes: might wanna check out $("form").serilaize() to...
[11:00:34] <bestdesign> is with ajax
[11:01:14] <FilipNortic_> setTimeout is async but not ajax
[11:01:25] <bestdesign> oh got it
[11:02:50] <bestdesign> for .ajax form submit the scriptCharset: 'utf-8', how much is required or matter?
[11:04:29] <FilipNortic_> utf-8 should be default
[11:07:43] <bestdesign> FilipNortic_ what you think idea when click on submit button in a form then check inputs empty and write as error message is can work as validate?
[11:07:48] <bestdesign> just this method?
[11:08:04] <bestdesign> with .preventDefault()
[11:08:09] <bestdesign> on click
[11:10:25] <FilipNortic_> if that is all the validation you need why not
[11:11:24] <bestdesign> yes I hate the backend validation and I like static sites
[11:11:40] <bestdesign> form with formspree for example
[11:11:47] <bestdesign> or formcarry
[11:26:22] <v0idpwn> So, I'm trying to use jQuery Mask. but when I run the function nothing happens at all. My content ignores the mask. My content is inside an <span class="mask-class">
[11:26:51] <v0idpwn> I tried running $('.mask-class').mask('mymask') at the console and it returns an object, but I see no change in the content.
[11:30:53] <FilipNortic_> v0idpwn: you attach the mask to an input element or a class of input elemnts and it changes the input-value?
[11:31:09] <FilipNortic_> seems pretty simple
[11:34:07] <v0idpwn> Doesnt happen.
[11:36:09] <FilipNortic_> make a fiddle and i'll check it otherwise my best guess would be invalid mask / value combo
[11:37:56] <v0idpwn> Downloaded the js file again and it worked... :thinking:
[11:41:24] <bestdesign> v0idpwnwhat you makeing?
[11:42:32] <v0idpwn> Format a numerical code stored as integer
[11:42:35] <v0idpwn> it did work
[12:27:22] <bestdesign> hey
[12:27:31] <bestdesign> how to set timeout for an if statement?
[12:27:41] <Buoy172> with setTimeout
[12:27:58] <Buoy172> bestdesign please explain
[12:28:06] <bestdesign> i try but got errors...
[12:28:10] <bestdesign> wait a sec
[12:28:24] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:28:38] <robertmaxrees> what do a timeout and an if statement have to do with each other.
[12:29:04] <bestdesign> well i want a delay
[12:29:09] <bestdesign> about 250 ms
[12:29:26] <Buoy172> and?
[12:29:28] <robertmaxrees> doesn't answer my question lol
[12:29:36] <robertmaxrees> show the code that's throwing the error?
[12:29:43] <bestdesign> yes a moment
[12:31:40] <bestdesign> https://paste.ee/p/rlhPT
[12:32:11] <bestdesign> i know at 7 lines
[12:32:36] <robertmaxrees> what's the error?
[12:32:59] <bestdesign> https://paste.ee/p/U3yM1
[12:33:04] <bestdesign> so with tis
[12:33:07] <bestdesign> and the error
[12:33:08] <robertmaxrees> ....
[12:33:09] <bestdesign> this*
[12:33:16] <robertmaxrees> that just the same pase.
[12:33:19] <robertmaxrees> *paste
[12:33:27] <bestdesign> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token )
[12:33:46] <robertmaxrees> well yeah.
[12:34:03] <bestdesign> this line setTimeout()
[12:34:03] <robertmaxrees> because you're not using setTimeout correctly.
[12:34:21] <bestdesign> correctly?
[12:34:43] <robertmaxrees> look carefully.
[12:34:48] <robertmaxrees> you pass a function to settimeout.
[12:34:53] <bestdesign> i set and also timeout in ms
[12:34:57] <robertmaxrees> but instead you're just doing setTimeout
[12:35:03] <robertmaxrees> and not passing anything.
[12:35:30] <bestdesign> you mean is at wrong place?
[12:35:40] <robertmaxrees> you pass setTimeout a functioon and a timeout as the two args.  but right now you're not passing anything.
[12:35:49] <robertmaxrees> and then you have a curly brace for some reason.
[12:36:00] <robertmaxrees> so it's setTimeout(function, timeout);
[12:36:20] <bestdesign> i see this at w3schools window settimeout
[12:36:38] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:36:38] <bestdesign> https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp
[12:36:41] <bestdesign> first example
[12:36:52] <robertmaxrees> so do you see the difference?
[12:37:28] <bestdesign> to set timeout in after function?
[12:37:31] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[12:37:37] <robertmaxrees> duder - look carefully.
[12:37:47] <robertmaxrees> your code right now literally has setTimeout() - right?
[12:38:06] <bestdesign> 		setTimeout(function, 3000)
[12:38:14] <robertmaxrees> your code does not currently have that.
[12:38:21] <robertmaxrees> notice how your paste has setTimeout() ?
[12:38:28] <bestdesign> but i need this one?
[12:38:30] <robertmaxrees> with nothing between the ( and ) ?
[12:38:41] <robertmaxrees> your code needs to be between the ( and )
[12:39:00] <bestdesign> setTimeout() ?
[12:39:12] <robertmaxrees> setTimeout(/* your code here */)
[12:40:15] <bestdesign> and delete 		{ ?
[12:40:36] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[12:40:53] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried?
[12:40:59] <robertmaxrees> show me :)
[12:41:12] <robertmaxrees> baby steps - we'll get there. gotta learn first though :)
[12:42:18] <bestdesign> setTimeout(function) { }, 3000);
[12:42:23] <robertmaxrees> close.
[12:42:44] <robertmaxrees> so when you declare a function, you want function() {}
[12:42:52] <bestdesign> yes
[12:42:52] <robertmaxrees> see how that's different to yours?
[12:43:03] <bestdesign> is not a function?
[12:43:06] <robertmaxrees> but right now you have function) { }, which doesn't make sense.
[12:43:08] <bestdesign> right?
[12:43:12] <robertmaxrees> you want function() {}, not function) { }
[12:43:23] <robertmaxrees> see the different between those two?
[12:43:27] <robertmaxrees> *difference
[12:44:48] <bestdesign> well settimeout also can use with own function
[12:45:13] <robertmaxrees> again - setTimeout(function, timeout)
[12:45:23] <robertmaxrees> the function has to be declared using function() {}
[12:45:27] <robertmaxrees> so all together that would be...
[12:46:17] <robertmaxrees> setTimeout(function() { /* your code here */ }, 3000);
[12:46:30] <FilipNortic> and he does it right for fadeIn later
[12:46:38] <bestdesign> ah!!!
[12:46:49] <robertmaxrees> see the difference?
[12:46:51] <bestdesign> than kyuo so much
[12:46:53] <bestdesign> yes
[12:46:54] <bestdesign> thank you
[12:46:59] <bestdesign> now understand :)
[12:47:02] <robertmaxrees> any time you declare a function, inline or otherwise, you want function() {}
[12:47:11] <bestdesign> wel lyeah
[12:47:17] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[12:47:26] <robertmaxrees> except at no point did you do that ;)
[12:47:47] <emsjessec> is it possible to submit a multipart form via http post using JQuery?  I don't see the boundaries in the network transaction like in a plain HTML POST
[12:48:08] <robertmaxrees> emsjessec not sure i follow - you mean using ajax?
[12:48:16] <emsjessec> yes
[12:48:40] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/5976031/923919
[12:48:53] <emsjessec> the server i'm connecting to requires true multipart encoding with boundaries separating the variables
[12:48:55] <robertmaxrees> that answer should clarify what you need to do.
[12:49:30] <bestdesign> you guys know formspree.io ?
[12:49:40] <bestdesign> ah sorry that not support ajax
[12:49:41] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[12:49:47] <bestdesign> form submission service
[12:49:51] <bestdesign> but there have more a lot
[12:49:54] <bestdesign> search google
[12:49:59] <bestdesign> for free also
[12:50:01] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:50:03] <robertmaxrees> lool
[12:50:13] <robertmaxrees> '
[12:50:13] <bestdesign> lol?
[12:50:14] <robertmaxrees> kay
[12:50:25] <robertmaxrees> thought you were going to ask a question :)
[12:50:53] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees as i read settimeout run once? so i need setInterval right?
[12:51:13] <robertmaxrees> bestdesign depends - what are you trying to accomplish?
[12:51:14] <bestdesign> its for verify an input field
[12:51:21] <bestdesign> filled or not
[12:51:23] <FilipNortic> you (almost) never need setInterval()
[12:51:28] <bestdesign> and i want delay the status message
[12:51:29] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:51:36] <bestdesign> oh got that
[12:51:46] <robertmaxrees> why not do it on input, blur, and subm,it?
[12:51:54] <robertmaxrees> instead of using intervals and timeouts?
[12:52:10] <bestdesign> i use blur for display status valid or not
[12:52:21] <robertmaxrees> so why do you need the timeouts?
[12:52:22] <bestdesign> and use button submit to display error messages
[12:52:24] <emsjessec> i'm not uploading any files
[12:52:34] <bestdesign> i use in animation with CSS too
[12:52:37] <bestdesign> 250ms delay
[12:52:46] <robertmaxrees> emsjessec you can follow all of that and ignore the stuff about files then?
[12:52:47] <bestdesign> so I want both
[12:52:54] <robertmaxrees> bestdesign still not following.
[12:53:00] <robertmaxrees> why do you need timeouts for that?
[12:53:08] <bestdesign> I use some animation with just CSS and there have a delay
[12:53:26] <FilipNortic> but why do you want to chain everything?
[12:53:44] <FilipNortic> does the order of the animation and the warning matter to you?
[12:53:45] <robertmaxrees> also confused about why you need to delay feedback like that.
[12:54:09] <bestdesign> well i try to do a website where used all smooth
[12:54:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:54:21] <bestdesign> like buttons hover effect focus etc
[12:54:31] <bestdesign> so all animation
[12:54:46] <bestdesign> and they got a delay this with CSS and try to do same delay with JS
[12:54:50] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i feel like i'd need to see an example.
[12:54:52] <bestdesign> for text change messages
[12:55:11] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise this seems... weird.  delaying feedback to end users for inputs is generally a bad idea.
[12:55:20] <FilipNortic> usally the users won't be ablew to tell and you save yourseld alot of head-scratching
[12:55:46] <FilipNortic> atleast make it simple first and complicate if you *Really* need to
[12:56:02] <bestdesign> well i will rethink
[12:57:54] <bestdesign> well still in setTimeout can use (this) as is lost with that function?
[12:58:05] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:58:10] <robertmaxrees> "as a lost"?
[12:58:57] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees u have website?
[12:59:03] <robertmaxrees> you mean 'this' isn't working in your setTimeout?  trying to refer back to the element?
[12:59:12] <robertmaxrees> and what do you mean "u have website"?? l;ol
[12:59:48] <bestdesign> oh setInterval is repeat
[12:59:58] <robertmaxrees> don't use setInterval
[13:00:08] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees you have own website :)?
[13:00:18] <robertmaxrees> sure?  i haven't updated it in years though.
[13:00:25] <robertmaxrees> since i'm usually busy with work.
[13:01:17] <bestdesign> oh got that
[13:01:27] <bestdesign> you will be online still with this nick :D?
[13:01:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:02:15] <bestdesign> You seems a pro
[13:02:16] <bestdesign> :D
[13:02:23] <bestdesign> and it works!!!! :D
[13:04:52] <bestdesign> well i will refill all .delay with settimeout
[13:05:01] <bestdesign> thats better?
[13:05:12] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:05:15] <robertmaxrees> don't use settimeout.
[13:05:18] <robertmaxrees> or setinterval.
[13:05:20] <robertmaxrees> like, at all.
[13:05:58] <bestdesign> .delay is not work on above example
[13:06:11] <robertmaxrees> because you're doing using it correctly :)
[13:06:12] <bestdesign> because make remove for a sec and breaks the look
[13:06:42] <emsjessec> robertmaxrees, it worked... i had to include,  var data = new FormData(); data.append('password','price'); ...
[13:06:44] <bestdesign> i mean with fadein and fadeout the .delay is remove the content for a bit
[13:06:56] <robertmaxrees> emsjessec awesome :)
[13:07:05] <robertmaxrees> bestdesign because you're not using them correctly (shrug)
[13:07:15] <robertmaxrees> bestdesign if you'd like more help, make a fiddle.
[13:13:39] <bestdesign> i try :D  http://jsfiddle.net/w2k1jtr8/
[13:13:52] <bestdesign> see second with delay seems remove the content
[13:14:32] <robertmaxrees> so you want to fade out, wait 250 ms, then fade in?
[13:14:45] <bestdesign> yes
[13:14:51] <bestdesign> i use .delay for wait 250ms
[13:14:57] <robertmaxrees> except you're using delay wrong.
[13:15:04] <bestdesign> but you see second hilang2
[13:15:12] <robertmaxrees> you're still using delay wrong :)
[13:15:15] <bestdesign> es remove for a moment its looks bad
[13:15:22] <robertmaxrees> you can't just slap it on $(this) and have it magically work.
[13:15:48] <bestdesign> hmm
[13:15:58] <robertmaxrees> reread https://api.jquery.com/delay/ - what does it say?
[13:16:03] <robertmaxrees> "Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue."
[13:16:10] <robertmaxrees> dopes any part of that pique your interest?
[13:16:13] <robertmaxrees> *does
[13:17:11] <bestdesign> $('.hilang2').delay(250).fadeOut(function() {
[13:17:15] <bestdesign> ?
[13:17:20] <bestdesign> right?
[13:17:24] <robertmaxrees> you can't just do .delay() like that.
[13:17:26] <robertmaxrees> again
[13:17:32] <robertmaxrees> reread the sentence I quoted.
[13:17:47] <robertmaxrees> does "subsequent items in the queue" sound familiar to you?
[13:18:14] <bestdesign> oh
[13:18:17] <bestdesign> new line?
[13:18:20] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[13:18:21] <robertmaxrees> no
[13:18:32] <bestdesign> you mean not in chain?
[13:18:33] <robertmaxrees> you can only .delay() off an animation queue.
[13:18:42] <robertmaxrees> otherwise it doens't do anything.
[13:19:17] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/queue/ you can read more about animation queues here.
[13:19:29] <bestdesign> well i want text delay
[13:19:30] <robertmaxrees> also: you aren't actually using jquery 1.7, right?
[13:19:32] <bestdesign> not animation
[13:19:41] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[13:19:43] <bestdesign> i am use 3.
[13:19:43] <robertmaxrees> you're not listening.
[13:20:31] <robertmaxrees> you need to manipulate the animation queue for the element.
[13:20:37] <bestdesign> well i got that is for animation only
[13:20:45] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:20:51] <robertmaxrees> i give up lol
[13:20:53] <robertmaxrees> good luck!
[13:20:53] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:21:00] <bestdesign> is works with fadein fadeout then?
[13:21:25] <robertmaxrees> .delay() needs an fx queue - animations create fx queues.
[13:21:37] <robertmaxrees> you can also create your own.
[13:22:09] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/effects/queue-and-dequeue-explained/
[13:22:17] <robertmaxrees> but also: https://learn.jquery.com/effects/intro-to-effects/
[13:22:24] <robertmaxrees> read up :) save yourself the headaches.
[13:24:16] <bestdesign> This will execute after all of the steps in the animation have completed.
[13:24:17] <bestdesign> hmm
[13:25:54] <bestdesign> / Hide all level 1 headings over half a second; then wait for 1.5 seconds// and reveal all level 1 headings over 0.3 seconds$( "h1" ).hide( 500 ).delay( 1500 ).show( 300 );
[13:26:27] <bestdesign> i got this :P
[13:26:32] <robertmaxrees> making more sense?
[13:26:52] <bestdesign> so for delay need to be hidden
[13:27:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:27:01] <bestdesign> if show and delay and show
[13:27:13] <bestdesign> that makes remove effect
[13:27:18] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't need to be hidden first.
[13:27:23] <robertmaxrees> that's not what those articles are saying at all.
[13:28:25] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/w2k1jtr8/2/
[13:28:30] <bestdesign> i am right?
[13:29:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:29:10] <robertmaxrees> you don't need fadeOut(function() {}); any more.
[13:29:36] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/o08v9f7g/1/
[13:30:37] <robertmaxrees> this should get you started.
[13:30:46] <bestdesign> ohhhhhhhh
[13:31:06] <robertmaxrees> you just need a queue - any animation creates an effects queue.
[13:31:07] <bestdesign> now understand
[13:31:16] <bestdesign> i dont need callback function for fadeout
[13:31:28] <bestdesign> is be in chain
[13:31:46] <robertmaxrees> also jquery animations return promises.
[13:32:45] <bestdesign> well i am pro at css animation :)
[13:32:54] <bestdesign> but thank you for ur help
[13:32:56] <bestdesign> very useful
[13:33:25] <bestdesign> this way i wil lremove all settimeout ahah
[13:33:26] <bestdesign> :D
[13:33:48] <robertmaxrees> cool
[13:35:04] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees i will make a nivigation with mouseenter and mouseleave so css :hover not know that so if you hover dropdown now for a sec it will be close
[13:35:06] <bestdesign> smart :)
[13:35:10] <bestdesign> navigation*
[13:35:23] <robertmaxrees> cool
[13:35:26] <bestdesign> with setttimeout and cleartimeout :)
[13:35:32] <robertmaxrees> nonono
[13:35:40] <robertmaxrees> why are you using timeouts still?
[13:36:28] <bestdesign> timeout for set 2s if user rejoin with mouse
[13:36:35] <bestdesign> then cleartimeout close nav
[13:36:38] <robertmaxrees> :(
[13:37:16] <bestdesign> well
[13:37:20] <bestdesign> rethink!
[13:37:50] <bestdesign> settimeout is need if mouse no more over on nav
[13:38:02] <robertmaxrees> :( :(
[13:38:06] <bestdesign> if join then cleartimeout and start again
[13:38:10] <bestdesign> but why bad?
[13:38:11] <robertmaxrees> still not a good idea but meh.  your site.  good luck.
[13:38:20] <bestdesign> well thanks :P
[13:38:27] <bestdesign> and appreciate your  help

[13:40:33] <bestdesign> well yes thanks again!
[13:42:20] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees for president :P
[13:43:52] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:16:25] <doekia> hi javascript gurus. I need within a ajax.beforeSend function to wait for a promise to return me data before I can let the function (beforeSend) complete. I have no clue how to address such issue. Seems to me trying to wait sync on an async call. Just to be clear I don't have control over the code of the promise
[14:18:15] <robertmaxrees> that's a strange thing to want to do.
[14:18:22] <robertmaxrees> why does that need to be in the beforeSend?
[14:19:26] <doekia> the result of the promise
[14:20:08] <robertmaxrees> let me rephrase
[14:20:18] <robertmaxrees> why not just do this before you call beforeSend?
[14:20:22] <robertmaxrees> what does the promise return that you need?
[14:20:58] <doekia> because the value returned by the promise evolves over time and cannot be predicted
[14:21:20] <robertmaxrees> so then create a wrapper function and call that instead of $.ajax() directly?
[14:22:15] <doekia> I'm a middleware ... I don't have control either of the caller (ajax), nor the promise
[14:22:28] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[14:23:42] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise you're gonna get into a weird scenario where you cancel the request and then fire it from with the beforesend.
[14:27:28] <doekia> Tried that but this make things weird for the consumer code... it receive a fail and does not wait for the re-fired ajax call
[16:05:09] <bestdesign> hey all :D
[16:06:31] <robertmaxrees> hello
[16:07:28] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees i need save ur nick :D
[16:07:33] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:07:37] <bestdesign> as a helper XD  :P
[16:07:40] <robertmaxrees> you can just ask questions out to the channel ;)
[16:07:59] <bestdesign> well i am not so often here but when ask here no one say nothing :D
[16:08:10] <bestdesign> i am a fan of robertmaxrees
[16:08:11] <bestdesign> lol
[16:08:12] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:08:18] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[16:09:19] <bestdesign> I am so slow but will make an awesome website :P
[16:09:23] <bestdesign> from scratch
[16:10:01] <bestdesign> somehow figure out a navigation only with jquery
[16:10:40] <bestdesign> use :before CSS to display menu items is not display
[16:10:49] <bestdesign> because screen size
[16:10:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:11:12] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to make a responsive design?
[16:11:30] <MassDebates> I think he's just cataloging his thoughts.
[16:11:35] <bestdesign> its not break by @media rule is calculate window how much menu item can add and hide
[16:11:46] <bestdesign> i make for sure :)
[16:11:47] <robertmaxrees> bestdesign are you asking for help?
[16:12:46] <bestdesign> i use outerWidth(function(i, s)
[16:12:53] <bestdesign> the function arguments names is matter?
[16:13:06] <bestdesign> i just type a letter
[16:13:17] <robertmaxrees> nmame them something that makes sense.
[16:13:43] <bestdesign> I think same like e is event usually
[16:13:50] <bestdesign> in arguments
[16:13:54] <MassDebates> The names help you identify the function and what it does without reading. Stop using single letter variables.
[16:14:07] <robertmaxrees> sure.  sometimes it makes more sense to use the full word though.
[16:14:13] <bestdesign> is not a variable
[16:14:18] <MassDebates> omg or constant
[16:14:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:14:35] <bestdesign> is something like .click(function(e)
[16:14:43] <bestdesign> and e.preventDefault;
[16:14:48] <robertmaxrees> sure...? nothing wrong with using event instead there.
[16:14:50] <bestdesign> to prevent default click
[16:14:54] <robertmaxrees> in fact i'd probably encourage "event" instead.
[16:14:59] <MassDebates> Why not .click(function(event)
[16:15:02] <bestdesign> well got that
[16:15:03] <MassDebates> or event.preventDefault?
[16:15:13] <MassDebates> event.preventDefault > e.preventDefault
[16:15:24] <bestdesign> for prevent a click from a default action need both yes
[16:15:30] <robertmaxrees> ....
[16:15:45] <MassDebates> Sorry I don't know why i got involved
[16:15:57] <bestdesign> :)
[16:15:58] <robertmaxrees> i can't decode what's happening any more.
[16:16:09] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees are you develop something nowadays?
[16:16:12] <MassDebates> lol
[16:16:12] <bestdesign> you are a pro :P
[16:16:17] <MassDebates> It doesn't stop, man.
[16:16:21] <robertmaxrees> uh, i mean, it's my job sooo
[16:16:35] <robertmaxrees> well, part of my job at least.
[16:16:44] <bestdesign> you have web design skills :)?
[16:17:03] <robertmaxrees> enough.  i work with a team of UI/UX people to do that for me though.
[16:18:05] <bestdesign> :)
[16:18:15] <robertmaxrees> why?
[16:19:04] <bestdesign> well i am thinking for an effect with CSS before the nav bar is not added to top with fixed what effects use one
[16:19:09] <bestdesign> some blur or not know hmm
[16:19:15] <robertmaxrees> ask in #css then
[16:19:37] <bestdesign> well yeah i not registered still
[16:19:39] <bestdesign> there is need
[16:19:40] <robertmaxrees> and/or #design
[16:19:44] <robertmaxrees> then reg and ask :)
[16:19:59] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees i love webkit scrollbars :D
[16:20:06] <robertmaxrees> cool?
[16:20:44] <bestdesign> yeah to style and I like the new amazing features for CSS
[16:20:50] <bestdesign> for nav is backdrop-filter
[16:21:00] <bestdesign> is make custom style behind nav background
[16:21:15] <bestdesign> like transparent and do a grayscale etc
[16:21:19] <bestdesign> thats cool
[16:22:21] <bestdesign> or blur :)  this way transparent background not affect the content behind it :D
[16:22:38] <MassDebates> bestdesign, this is a channel for supporting people with questions
[16:22:48] <bestdesign> okey sorry
[16:22:49] <bestdesign> it
[16:22:51] <MassDebates> This isn't a place for idle chat about web development.
[16:22:55] <robertmaxrees> or design
[16:23:03] <bestdesign> sorry!
[16:23:07] <robertmaxrees> feel free to head over to a more appropriate channel for that :)
[16:23:43] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees I found your github :)
[16:24:55] <bestdesign> well still think about the .one is good for preloader than .load?
[16:25:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:25:05] <bestdesign> as I know it run once? like preloader
[16:25:16] <robertmaxrees> that's not what .one() is for.
[16:25:23] <bestdesign> on page load
[16:25:34] <bestdesign> hmm I just copy a snippet
[16:25:38] <robertmaxrees> ./..
[16:25:41] <bestdesign> there was .one
[16:25:50] <robertmaxrees> what are you binding to?
[16:25:56] <robertmaxrees> the load event?
[16:25:58] <robertmaxrees> for the page or...?
[16:26:08] <bestdesign> yes display an gif
[16:26:14] <bestdesign> and after load hide it
[16:26:15] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter which you use.
[16:26:24] <robertmaxrees> since the page's load event will only ever fire once.
[16:26:52] <bestdesign> .one('load', function()
[16:26:59] <robertmaxrees> literally no reason to use that.
[16:27:24] <robertmaxrees> also: in jquery 3.0 .load() for event handling has been deprecated anyway.
[16:27:39] <bestdesign> I use .on('load', function()
[16:27:48] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[16:29:51] <bestdesign> https://paste.ee/p/jtLHm
[16:30:21] <bestdesign> so is more logic just with .on load?
[16:30:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:31:46] <bestdesign> https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/event_one.asp
[16:31:57] <robertmaxrees> don't use w3schools.
[16:31:59] <bestdesign> on example is run once like a preloader on page load
[16:32:00] <robertmaxrees> use the jquery api docs.
[16:32:04] <robertmaxrees> and again
[16:32:08] <bestdesign> well yeah
[16:32:11] <robertmaxrees> the window load event only fires once.
[16:32:22] <robertmaxrees> so it doesn't matter if you use .one or .on
[16:32:38] <bestdesign> oh got it!
[16:32:41] <bestdesign> thanks again
[16:32:51] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/ you should try this tutorial
[16:33:17] <bestdesign> I need to improve my skills
[16:33:20] <bestdesign> yes thanks!
[16:34:40] <bestdesign> thanks for your help mister moderator robertmaxrees :)
[16:34:57] <bestdesign> i have to go sleep
[16:35:08] <bestdesign> thanks again!
[16:57:57] <bestdesign> if still anyone here what is usage difference of .is('visible')
[16:58:03] <bestdesign> vs in selector :visible ?
[16:58:16] <bestdesign> #id:visible
[16:58:18] <robertmaxrees> uh
[16:58:41] <robertmaxrees> wheere are you seeing .is('visible') without the : ?
[16:58:47] <bestdesign> like :visible can use for that elements where will use :fadeOut?
[16:58:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:58:59] <bestdesign> is just a copy paste there are;
[16:59:24] <robertmaxrees> not following.
[16:59:29] <bestdesign> I mean use on that elements where text for example will be fadeOut
[16:59:31] <robertmaxrees> wheere are you seeing .is('visible') without the : ?
[16:59:49] <bestdesign> i just write
[16:59:54] <bestdesign> for example
[16:59:54] <robertmaxrees> that's not a thing.
[16:59:59] <robertmaxrees> you cannot use that.
[17:00:06] <bestdesign> with .is and selector:visible
[17:00:14] <bestdesign> i know ; every line needed
[17:00:22] <robertmaxrees> i'm not asking about  ;
[17:00:32] <robertmaxrees> can you try rephrasing your question?
[17:00:41] <bestdesign> okey a moment
[17:01:32] <bestdesign> $('#div').is(':visible') vs $('#div:visible').fadeOut
[17:01:39] <bestdesign> have any diffenrece about 2 select?
[17:01:44] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[17:02:13] <bestdesign> well for me is means all the way div is visible
[17:02:24] <robertmaxrees> let me expl;ain - one sec.
[17:02:43] <bestdesign> thank you!
[17:02:51] <robertmaxrees> $('#div:visible') will use the :visible implementation within jQuery's selector engine, which may or may not be faster depending on whether or not the browser supports it.
[17:02:52] <robertmaxrees> however
[17:03:23] <robertmaxrees> $('#div').is(':visible') is generally smarter because you can select all the elements beforehand and "cache" them for later use.
[17:03:32] <robertmaxrees> and then use the .is() on that collection.
[17:03:55] <bestdesign> amazing :)
[17:03:58] <robertmaxrees> any time you can select one and reuse many, the better.
[17:04:09] <robertmaxrees> but also
[17:04:21] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
[17:04:30] <robertmaxrees> again
[17:04:33] <robertmaxrees> go through the tutorial
[17:04:49] <bestdesign> i will ofc from TV
[17:05:09] <bestdesign> still a really last question and I go to sleep
[17:05:09] <robertmaxrees> it will answer many of your questions.
[17:06:37] <bestdesign> where in a function start with .removeClass there is need .end? before .addClass?
[17:06:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:06:51] <robertmaxrees> okay from here on out
[17:06:58] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle with an example of what you're trying to do.
[17:07:06] <robertmaxrees> instead of these piecemeal questions.
[17:07:21] <bestdesign> a moment
[17:10:24] <bestdesign> sorry I need go now I will be back
