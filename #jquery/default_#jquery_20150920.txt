[01:17:27] <rindolf> Hi all.
[01:42:38] <Gaussian_blur>  
[03:36:17] <momomo> is jquery needed anymore today? aren't most events and such already provided ?
[03:39:26] <shoky> momomo: judge for yourself  http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/
[03:46:58] <hapi> there's a few feature which is easier with jq
[03:48:32] <hapi> working with selectors is much easier, i know about querySelectorAll, but for me have some benefits
[04:53:29] <glaucom> hi all,
[04:54:10] <glaucom> someone could help me with a doubt in jquery ajax and POST?
[05:06:18] <hapi> glaucom, what is your problem?
[05:09:38] <glaucom> hapi, i downloaded theme devOOPs
[05:10:21] <glaucom> i I created all the pages that presisava but I can not make a post on the same page
[05:10:50] <glaucom> http://devoops.me/handmade/1/
[05:11:56] <hapi> please provide an example where your problem signed
[05:17:42] <glaucom> hapi, http://imgur.com/a/q5q7M
[05:19:52] <hapi> extend your ajax with error, and complete handlers to make sure there is no error
[05:20:05] <hapi> error: function(e) {...}
[06:27:24] <mrkie> why this doesn't work <a onclick="parent.$('input[name="kwhschatting"]').val('1234');" href="#">Click</a> ?
[06:27:42] <mrkie> just in the parent itself $('input[name="kwhschatting"]').val('1234'); works
[06:34:42] <mrkie> already fixed it
[07:00:48] <nirakara> http://jsfiddle.net/zL77q4oq/1/ why is mainQueue undefined in the ready() function?
[07:20:46] <shoky`> nirakara: if the .callRouter call is asynchronous, which it looks like it is, then the problem is that line 7 runs before line 25.  because the callRouter callback is only called later, much after line 7 has already ran
[07:21:28] <shoky`> nirakara: you need to access it only in the callback. you can change your own function to accept a callback to be called with the data
[07:22:59] <shoky`> nirakara:  for example-  http://jsfiddle.net/zL77q4oq/7/
[07:25:02] <shoky`> nirakara: oops little fix  http://jsfiddle.net/zL77q4oq/8/
[07:29:20] <noahmg123> I have an image picker plugin that somehow erases the images when I run a certain ajax function to create the seect list it displays the images on.
[07:33:49] <noahmg123> nevermind I fixed it
[07:46:08] <dimi1947> k
[07:58:21] <nirakara> shoky, thanks. but shouldn't that array become populated...eventually? it never seems to be. here's my full code at the moment. i'd be open to brutal correction:http://jsfiddle.net/zL77q4oq/9/
[08:00:03] <nirakara> shoky, the events (L39-85) are mostly a hook into a lib im using and are working fine. now I'm trying to get the "new object came in" bit working right. The intention is to set a loop which executes some animation and shows the next item in the queue.
[08:01:27] <nirakara> if there's nothing in the cue, get some random stuff from the backend and drop it into the queue
[08:02:06] <nirakara> *cue = quueue
[08:02:09] <nirakara> *queue
[08:02:11] <nirakara> :/
[08:03:35] <nirakara> also, the queue is never updated, even in mainLoop() when the check is done every time
[08:04:19] <nirakara> im also not sure how L28 of http://jsfiddle.net/zL77q4oq/8/ solves the problem because...where is that callback called?
[08:04:26] <nirakara> shoky, ^^
[08:06:39] <nirakara> shoky, adding your suggested changes threw a ReferenceError: callback is not defined. what should i call there?
[08:08:10] <shoky`> nirakara: the callback is called in that line, line 28.  you need to also add the callback argument to the function (line 20)  and pass a callback function when you call it (line 7)
[08:10:25] <shoky`> nirakara: and it solves the problem by calling your code (line 8) *after* the async request has completed, via a callback,  and not before the async request has completed like in your fiddle
[08:11:21] <shoky`> nirakara: and yes the array will become populated eventually in your exampe, but that doesnt help you because you're trying to access it long before then
[08:29:40] <epinky> hello, I need a simple list with selectable option. I mean something like selectable from jquery-ui but just using the basic jquery, could you point to some code, plugin or something similar?
[08:59:39] <krambiorix> hi , is there a way to trigger the file download popup without revealing the location?
[09:00:24] <hapi> nope
[09:01:09] <hapi> use temporary location
[09:01:19] <jayjo> Is there a way to do a 'column wise' operation in js/jquery? I'm not sure of the search terms to research this issue,but I ahve a fiddle here that shows the issue I'm facing: http://jsfiddle.net/ors13muk/2/
[09:01:36] <hapi> move the file into a an on the fly created folder when the request comes, and then remove
[09:01:39] <krambiorix> hapi, can't i just return (from the server) the binary data ?
[09:01:45] <jayjo> I would like to do an operation element-wise, to calculate the difference of the number of a span and replace a similar span elsewhere
[09:02:30] <hapi> krambiorix, you can't. this is how the http works
[09:02:52] <hapi> the most popular solution is the temp dolder
[09:02:56] <hapi> *folder
[09:04:07] <hapi> http://cdnsun.com/knowledgebase/cdn-static/setting-a-url-signing-protect-your-cdn-content
[09:04:13] <hapi> another solution
[09:35:24] <arup_r> Why my `e.preventDefault();` is not working ?  http://codepen.io/aruprakshit/pen/qONNEr
[09:38:41] <arup_r> I know.. the reason
[09:38:51] <arup_r> I forgot to add Jquery lib there :(
[09:39:33] <arup_r> nah still not working
[09:43:17] <hapi> arup_r: there is a typo:)
[09:43:22] <hapi> .lsit
[09:43:25] <arup_r> ummmmm
[09:43:26] <arup_r> :(
[10:47:00] <bjonnh> what's the best way to access the input element when using the click action of button? http://pastebin.com/LA8iFqtQ
[10:47:26] <bjonnh> I was thinking of getting the parent, then getting the input child
[10:47:34] <bjonnh> but maybe there is a better way for that
[10:50:16] <bjonnh> oh .siblings
[11:21:52] <BostonGeorge2k> hi, with jquery i do something like this: $('.services').find(".button").on('click', function()
[11:22:07] <BostonGeorge2k> i also want to apply this function call on $('.services').find("i").on('click', function()
[11:22:26] <BostonGeorge2k> do i have to create two calls or can i somehow chain it
[11:22:44] <BostonGeorge2k> like if-button-click-or-i-click-do-function
[11:24:43] <jcrawford> $('.button, i').click(function() { }); <-- that should work binding to multiple elements
[11:25:21] <jcrawford> you could also do $('.services .button, .services i').click(function() { });
[11:25:30] <jcrawford> if it must be a child of .services
[11:25:55] <BostonGeorge2k> thats even nicer :) thanks
[12:45:48] <nirakara> shoky, thanks for the help
[12:46:02] <nirakara> still getting used to callbacks and stuff and you're really patient. thanks
[12:46:28] <nirakara> in other news, when chrome throws something like this: Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) -- is there a way i can handle that exception?
[12:54:44] <arup_r> I am opening a modal window like `$("#modal-window").modal("show");` working. How to close it using Jquery ?
[12:54:59] <arup_r> $("#modal-window").modal("close"); not working
[12:58:28] <arup_r> $("#modal-window").modal("hide"); worked
[12:58:33] <arup_r> This is life
[12:58:36] <arup_r> :(
[13:01:49] <jayjo> arup_r: try hide
[13:02:34] <arup_r> yes tried.. and worked
[14:16:03] <gagiD> what iPhone did different with event for click/touch so it doesn't work?
[14:18:20] <gagiD> i try this fix(http://pastebin.com/XJ4kP1rU) but still don't work
[14:40:37] <hapi> gagiD, not using different events. your probleme be somewhere else
[14:47:17] <pyCasso> How would I write a conditional or selector if string is within another string? example: input_string = 'apple';   base_string = 'apples are red';
[14:47:56] <pyCasso> if( input_string in base_string ) { console.log('Yes apples are found in string')}
[14:48:49] <gagiD> base_string.indexOf(input_string) != -1
[14:48:51] <gagiD> i think
[16:44:19] <DeltaHeavy> In a file containing a module, should I put 'use strict' above the declaration or inside it?
[16:56:27] <jayjo> Does anyone have experience with the tinysort plugin?
[16:56:42] <jayjo> It's properly sorting my <td> elements, but it's not moving the rest of the <tr> with it
[16:57:37] <BostonGeorge2k> hi, i have this little snippet that allows me to show different contents on different links : http://jsfiddle.net/yotLyqe9/
[16:58:10] <BostonGeorge2k> however, if you click the links two fast one after another it might happened that two boxes are are shown
[16:58:17] <BostonGeorge2k> how can i prevent this? :/
[17:17:13] <oscarb92> hello
[17:18:05] <oscarb92> I'm using a jQuery handler to resize an image when page loads so it can properly fit into a div
[17:18:50] <oscarb92> but when I press the back button in order to navigate to the page where it happens, that handler won't work (the image is not resized)
[17:19:19] <gagiD> oscarb92: just set max-width and max-height for image
[17:19:24] <gagiD> 100%
[17:19:26] <DeltaHeavy> oscarb92: You shouldn't be using JS for that.
[17:20:38] <oscarb92> DeltaHeavy: I use it because it needs to fit in a square div, so I use it to calculate width and height and adjust it properly without losing it's aspect ratio
[17:21:44] <DeltaHeavy> oscarb92: You can do that in CSS
[17:22:45] <oscarb92> DeltaHeavy: so, would it be off-topic if ask you how could I do that in css?
[17:23:25] <DeltaHeavy> Naw you're fine
[17:23:33] <DeltaHeavy> Can you whip up a codepen.io or jsfiddle.net?
[17:42:34] <oscarb92> DeltaHeavy: what I do with js is to verify whether the image's width is larger than its height or viceversa, such as if the first condition applies it takes the height of the div for the image and keeps its width, and viceversa if the second condition applies
[17:42:57] <oscarb92> DeltaHeavy: I also apply overflow: hidden
[17:43:12] <oscarb92> DeltaHeavy: So it only shows that part of the image
[17:48:07] <oscarb92> DeltaHeavy: what I do with js is to verify whether the image's width is larger than its height or viceversa, such as if the first condition applies it takes the height of the div for the image and keeps its width, and viceversa if the second condition applies
[17:48:30] <oscarb92> DeltaHeavy: I also apply overflow: hidden
[17:48:31] <oscarb92> DeltaHeavy: So it only shows that part of the image
[17:54:03] <DeltaHeavy> oscarb92: Can still be done with CSS
[18:00:41] <oscarb92> DeltaHeavy: Show me pls https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=I5jGMNmx0w
[18:08:05] <DeltaHeavy> oscarb92: Get something up with a container and image in question
[18:17:12] <oscarb92> DeltaHeavy: like that?
[18:17:59] <DeltaHeavy> oscarb92: How big is the container? You want it to be the full width/height of the container but not change the aspect ratio?
[18:19:22] <oscarb92> DeltaHeavy: correct, If its wider than taller keep the width (hiding the overflow) and adjust the height to the div's
[18:19:50] <oscarb92> DeltaHeavy: If its taller than wider keep the height (hiding the overflow) and adjust the width to the div's
[18:25:47] <oscarb92> DeltaHeavy: check out the fiddle, I want that but considering wider images also
[18:26:58] <DeltaHeavy> oscarb92: display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto;
[18:28:29] <oscarb92> DeltaHeavy: cool, that works with taller images, but what if that same image src is dinamically changed to a wider image
[18:29:02] <DeltaHeavy> oscarb92: It will only ever be as wide as its parent container due to that CSS
[18:30:38] <oscarb92> DeltaHeavy: I understand, but is there a way to apply that same logic to images where width > height?
[18:30:56] <oscarb92> DeltaHeavy: I'm not sure I'm explaining myself properly
[18:34:11] <oscarb92> DeltaHeavy: Look at the fiddle, I changed that image, but since it's wider than taller, I want it to keep its width (hiding the overflow) and get the containers height (so it will only show the portion 0th to the 500th pixel in the x-axis)
[18:35:16] <DeltaHeavy> oscarb92: Not sure what you're saying?
[18:36:58] <arc_> -_- @ prefixing every line with an address
[18:38:02] <oscarb92> DeltaHeavy: check out the pseudo-code in the fiddle
[18:38:11] <oscarb92> DeltaHeavy: is there a way to do that without js?
[18:38:48] <DeltaHeavy> oscarb92: Can't use max-height like hat
[18:39:04] <DeltaHeavy> oscarb92: Still have no clue whaty ou want
[18:39:12] <oscarb92> DeltaHeavy: well, it works
[18:40:02] <oscarb92> DeltaHeavy: to crop the image in width or height depending on its aspect ratio, basically
[18:41:22] <oscarb92> DeltaHeavy: wide > height, crop it horizontally... wide < height, crop it vertically
[21:29:42] <colonel_panic> hey all
[21:30:35] <colonel_panic> I'm working on a responsive website with a "hamburger" menu, and I am having trouble getting jQuery to recognize click and touch events on a UL LI A element
[21:31:19] <colonel_panic> The idea is to add the CSS "display:none" to the menu on touchend, but it's not working
[21:35:31] <colonel_panic> Here's the line that's giving me trouble
[21:35:50] <colonel_panic> $("#burgerFlyOut li a").bind('touchstart', function(){
[21:35:50] <colonel_panic> 			alert("triggered!");
[21:53:11] <colonel_panic> Anybody alive in here?
[21:55:52] <SirLagz> colonel_panic: always
[21:57:55] <colonel_panic> What I'm doing seems so simple, and the console is throwing no errors yet it doesn't work
[22:12:00] <lenswipee> colonel_panic: use console_log()
[23:02:09] <colonel_panic> lenswpiee I did use console.log(). No events are being detected
[23:03:09] <colonel_panic> I'm trying to detect touchscreen events on an anchor tag, and that link functions perfectly yet no touch event is being captured by the Javascript
[23:08:00] <andrew9184> i think theres a pecularity when it comes to touchscreen events on an anchor tag
[23:08:12] <andrew9184> try putting cursor: pointer on it
[23:08:23] <andrew9184> are you preventing default ?
[23:09:16] <andrew9184> why are you using .bind ?
[23:15:17] <colonel_panic> Do I need to add an event listener on page load?
[23:15:34] <colonel_panic> I thought that kind of thing was unnecessary with JQuery
[23:15:41] <andrew9184> not if you wrap it with document.ready
[23:15:48] <andrew9184> unless you are asynchronously adding the link item
[23:15:58] <colonel_panic> Ah hell
[23:16:08] <andrew9184> but you asking this demonstrates a lack of understanding
[23:16:14] <colonel_panic> The server I've been posting this to is no longer accessible
[23:16:17] <andrew9184> and i would recommend reading jquery
[23:16:30] <colonel_panic> I'm getting a wifi login page whenever I try to load the page
[23:17:19] <colonel_panic> I guess I'm going to have to mess around with port forwarding on my router in order to test this on a touch device
[23:17:40] <andrew9184> just make a fiddle and do an isolated test case
[23:17:51] <colonel_panic> Yeah, I guess I can do that
[23:18:16] <colonel_panic> That'll be easier when asking for help
[23:25:03] <colonel_panic> https://jsfiddle.net/er38rmah/
[23:26:19] <colonel_panic> There it is
[23:26:32] <colonel_panic> Of course there's a lack of understanding!
[23:26:48] <colonel_panic> If I understood the problem I wouldn't be here asking for help, would I?
[23:27:13] <colonel_panic> What does "reading JQuery" mean?
[23:28:01] <colonel_panic> I've been working with JQuery for years. This is a problem I haven't encountered before, and I'm asking for help.
[23:31:43] <Kartagis> colonel_panic: what's your issue?
[23:33:22] <arc_> well .. in this fiddle, there is a syntax error and you haven't loaded jquery
[23:34:13] <andrew9184> if you’ve used jquery for years you wouldn’t be asking when you add the event listener
[23:34:41] <Kartagis> and the extra })
[23:35:01] <colonel_panic> The reason I asked is because it's a very simple thing that's not working, and I can't figure out why
[23:35:36] <colonel_panic> You guys bare looking at the original version... here
[23:35:37] <colonel_panic> https://jsfiddle.net/er38rmah/4/
[23:35:44] <arc_> .css('display: none') is essentially equivalent to .hide()
[23:35:52] <colonel_panic> okay
[23:36:01] <colonel_panic> I tried .hide and it did not work
[23:36:54] <colonel_panic> IBy this point I'm just trying different things in hopes of stumbling across the fix
[23:37:17] <colonel_panic> You can see what I'm trying to do, yes?
[23:38:01] <colonel_panic> Why does it make any difference to add CSS to control the shape of the cursor?
[23:39:08] <arc_> how are you physically trying to fire this event
[23:39:19] <andrew9184> arc_: he’s touching the screen
[23:39:40] <arc_> ok
[23:39:47] <colonel_panic> So when I use hide()
[23:39:56] <arc_> well it works when i change it to .hide() and change the event to click
[23:40:06] <arc_> because i'm not loading it on my phone to test
[23:40:24] <colonel_panic> It makes the menu disappear, but the menu doesn't reappear when I click the hamburger icon again
[23:40:51] <arc_> well you don't have anything to make it do that, so that makes sense
[23:41:05] <arc_> you're using a css hover to make it appear
[23:41:34] <andrew9184> ayodele
[23:42:12] <colonel_panic> I'm using both :hover and :focus. Anyway, on a computer you kinda have to hover before you can click it
[23:42:14] <colonel_panic> right?
[23:42:28] <colonel_panic> It doesn't reappear when I hover over it either
[23:43:23] <arc_> if you're going to use jquery to hide it, use jquery to show it
[23:43:30] <colonel_panic> This is the problem I've been trying to deal with. How to make it disappear when touched, and then reappear again when the icon is touched
[23:43:39] <arc_> it doesn't make sense to split this functionality between jquery and css
[23:43:40] <colonel_panic> OK I guess so.
[23:43:47] <colonel_panic> Sure
[23:44:21] <colonel_panic> I just thought it was the adding and subtraction of CSS styles, so what's the diff?
[23:45:20] <colonel_panic> I was originally hoping to just to a CSS-only menu but that's not in the stars
