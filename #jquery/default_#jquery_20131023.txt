[00:22:29] <DRSK> How'd one make https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/jquery-boilerplate/blob/master/src/jquery.boilerplate.js AMD ready basically before line 3?
[00:32:43] <d3m0n> Hey guys I got a pretty straight forward piece of code that I can't seem to get working, I am trying to get the console to logged the scrolled amount - http://pastebin.com/DW3b5xcj
[00:33:15] <d3m0n> log*
[00:34:07] <Cork> d3m0n: does the .parallax element have a scrollbar?
[00:34:46] <d3m0n> Cork: It's the wrapper of all my content only the page itself has a scrollbar
[00:34:52] <d3m0n> but only*
[00:35:06] <Cork> d3m0n: then there's your problem
[00:35:17] <Cork> it never fires a scroll event cause it doesn't have one
[00:35:30] <d3m0n> Cork: I did try to attach it to body as well
[00:35:34] <ravenzz> also scrolled would be the same
[00:35:40] <Cork> body doesn't have it either
[00:35:53] <ravenzz> you can cache $(window)
[00:36:10] <ravenzz> but you've got to get the scrollTop
[00:36:40] <Cork> d3m0n: the element that fires the scroll event is the window
[00:36:55] <Cork> (unless you have a specific element without overflow: auto or scroll
[00:36:58] <Cork> )
[00:38:49] <d3m0n> Cork: cool, thanks - so with the updated code it fires off just once http://pastebin.com/NahHkfr5 should it not keep firing everytime there is a scroll event?
[00:39:27] <Cork> d3m0n: consoles normally collapse the same message into one line (with a count)
[00:40:19] <ravenzz> d3m0n http://jsfiddle.net/urkN8/
[00:40:26] <ravenzz> consider to throttle that fn
[00:43:54] <d3m0n> Perfect thanks Cork & ravenzz
[00:57:16] <bigbugjava> any1 knows a good parallax scrolling guide?
[00:58:19] <jphase> bigbugjava: this is the one I first learned on http://themeforest.s3.amazonaws.com/116_parallax/tutorial-source-files/tut-index.html
[00:58:57] <jphase> but I use this one now http://f6design.com/projects/parallax-scrolling/
[00:59:00] <jphase> for reference
[01:29:29] <d3m0n> I am trying to animate just the Y axis on background position: .animate({'background-position': 'center '+calcSpeed(0.4)+'px' }, 10); doesnt want to work does that look wrong?
[01:29:50] <Woet> d3m0n: www.jsfiddle.net please
[01:30:50] <d3m0n> Eh figured it would be a simple peice of code not to fiddle
[01:40:26] <d3m0n> Woet: http://jsfiddle.net/xbRyz/
[01:41:07] <Woet> d3m0n: you didn't pick jQuery on the left, it's not gonna work
[01:41:51] <d3m0n> Woet: Sorry I dont understand
[01:42:10] <Woet> here: http://jsfiddle.net/xbRyz/1/
[01:42:13] <Woet> on the left you can pick the library
[01:42:15] <Woet> you didn't pick jquery
[01:42:27] <Woet> i don't think it can animate if you have center there
[01:42:32] <Woet> because it's not a number
[01:42:48] <Woet> so you will have to calculate the center yourself and use that
[01:43:17] <d3m0n> Woet: if you look at the css on the one that does work it uses generated pixels + center
[01:43:24] <d3m0n> even adding left or 0 still doesnt work
[01:43:45] <Woet> then i'm not sure
[01:44:06] <d3m0n> Hrmm
[01:45:47] <d3m0n> Thats weird
[01:52:56] <finished> hai, how can I call a function when spacebar or click are pressed?
[02:01:38] <cuzimbanned> <finished> hai, how can I call a function when spacebar or click are pressed?
[02:04:00] <d3m0n> Anyone else want to try and take a crack at why the background position won't work? http://jsfiddle.net/xbRyz/3/
[02:04:06] <d3m0n> I am stumped
[02:08:42] <cuzimbanned> cuzimbanned> <finished> hai, how can I call a function when spacebar or click are pressed?
[02:13:20] <torbjorn> is it possible to get "headless" DOM access? I am writing a web app in perl, and when writing tests, I can use Javascript::V8 to run and test plain js code that is not DOM-related, but what about DOM code, it would be nice to have a headles DOM too, so that I could also test jquery code
[02:13:38] <Clex> torbjorn: try PhantomJS / CasperJS.
[02:14:38] <torbjorn> thanks
[02:17:30] <torbjorn> hm do they make a real http request?
[02:18:01] <cuzimbanned> <cuzimbanned> cuzimbanned> <finished> hai, how can I call a function when spacebar or click are pressed?
[02:19:03] <slax0r> cuzimbanned: .keyUp and .click
[02:21:04] <cuzimbanned> slax0r: can I use if (e.which == 32){ ?
[02:21:15] <amcsi_work> is it possible to make it so in $.ajax the success method is run even if the HTTP code isn't 2XX as long as the response content makes sense?
[02:21:20] <amcsi_work> I have meaningful error messages in the response data, but the error method's xhr object doesn't let me access it easily
[02:21:22] <slax0r> don't know which code is for spacebar, but yes
[02:21:53] <slax0r> amcsi_work: no, if response http code is anything other than 2xx it goes to error
[02:22:26] <amcsi_work> and there's no option I can set to override this?
[02:23:03] <amcsi_work> is it not recommended to send non-2XX HTTP codes on purpose from the server side when working with jQuery ajax on the client side?
[02:23:49] <slax0r> amcsi_work: maybe you can use complete?
[02:24:40] <amcsi_work> slax0r, it also doesn't contain the data object
[02:25:09] <amcsi_work> or is there something I can call which would make it into the format it would be as "data" in "success"?
[02:25:31] <amcsi_work> which is dataType dependent
[02:27:26] <slax0r> I don't think so...
[02:27:33] <slax0r> well, what kind of status codes are you setting?
[02:27:44] <slax0r> afaik, 3xx should also go to success
[02:27:53] <slax0r> 4xx and 5xx are http errors, those should go to error
[02:40:24] <hughajwood> Hi, I was wondering if JQuery had an implementation of anti dom thrashing techniques as of yet or planned, I had seen it was discussed but couldn't find anything further
[03:00:09] <EugenA> I have table, on click I set the color of the clicked cell
[03:00:43] <EugenA> how can I remove the color of last clicked cell, so only one cell is always marked?
[03:02:09] <slax0r> $('td').click(function () { $(this).removeColor(); } );
[03:02:15] <slax0r> removeColor doesn't exist obviously
[03:02:30] <slax0r> oh, last clicked
[03:02:49] <slax0r> either .each() through all of them, and remove the color on all
[03:03:03] <slax0r> or on click save that cell somewhere and access it later in another click
[03:13:02] <[E]sc> how do you clear an ajax formdata when using it to upload a file dynamically?
[03:41:40] <nardev> hello, i want just blur/overlay content in one div, is there some simple way to do that? Or i have to make it by hand with putting special bit transparent div over that particular one?
[03:44:35] <[E]sc> nardev, i think you can use this: http://css-plus.com/2012/03/gaussian-blur/
[03:44:51] <valtido> @narden you can create a small script/plugin that can get the offset and dimentions (width/height), of the target and insertAfter the target
[03:45:09] <nardev> [E]sc, ah, http://jquery.malsup.com/block/#demos would be perfect but i should not pun any more plugins here :(
[03:45:42] <nardev> valtido, that is what i was asking if there is some simple way to do that
[03:46:40] <valtido> the tricky part would be the parent, which needs to be relative ...
[03:47:42] <valtido> @nardev could you not try the css .classname{ -webkit-filter: blur(2px);  }
[03:48:28] <nardev> valtido, hm, maybe but there is some form in that div which i want to shadow and i want to block it too..
[03:48:57] <valtido> box-shadow?
[03:48:57] <nardev> valtido, it doesn't need to be blur effect it can be just overlay with some transparency
[03:49:12] <valtido> opacity:0.5?
[03:49:21] <nardev> yes but is stays active..
[03:50:14] <valtido> how do you mean it stays active ?
[03:50:51] <siovene> Hi. I'm seeing an AJAX call of mine being "canceled" after 501ms and I'm not doing anything. What might cause that?
[03:51:23] <siovene> I'm using $.get, and there is no timeout specified.
[03:52:32] <nardev> valtido, i have form in some div, after user clicks "calculate" i want small popup to be opened with feedback and i want the div with form to be disabled for editing and covered with some gray see through div
[03:52:38] <Cork> siovene: the server normally have a timeout
[03:53:08] <nardev> siovene, check server side?
[03:53:27] <shoky> siovene: could be a link or form that was clicked/submitted without .preventDefault.. could be a cross-domain issue
[03:53:31] <siovene> nardev, server side I get a "Pipe broken", because the client interrupted the communication.
[03:53:52] <siovene> shoky, I'm returning false from the click() function.
[03:54:22] <Cork> siovene: try using $.ajax(url, { type:'get', timeout: 50000 })
[03:54:34] <siovene> Cork, I just increaded the timeout and it worked this time.
[03:54:45] <siovene> But it's really strange, I didn't specify 500ms anywhere.
[03:55:01] <Cork> siovene: might be the browser has a timeout for the connection
[03:55:11] <siovene> Cork, but the same was in Chrome and FF.
[03:55:27] <shoky> siovene: chrome://net-internals/#events   if you want to see the request in detail, and feel like it ;p
[03:55:52] <siovene> shoky, I tried that too, didn't find anything relevant.
[03:56:06] <valtido> @nardev http://malsup.com/jquery/block/#demos
[03:56:08] <shoky> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[03:56:14] <valtido> @nardev would this do ?
[03:56:32] <Cork> siovene: just checked the documentations, and ya unless you set it thorough $.ajaxSetup there shouldn't be a timeout
[03:56:36] <nardev> valtido, i said before, that would be GREAT
[03:56:39] <Cork> neither the browser or jquery sets one
[03:56:49] <nardev> but i should not add more plugins.. already too many..
[03:56:55] <Cork> (documentation and source)
[03:57:02] <siovene> Cork, yeah, I checked that too, that's why it's a bit odd.
[03:57:32] <nardev> valtido, i need this one http://malsup.com/jquery/block/#element
[03:59:05] <TeraJL> is there any way to know if the style property came from :focus selector?
[03:59:15] <shoky> siovene: sure it's not a cross-origin issue maybe?  http vs https   http://bla.com vs http://www.bla.com   etc
[03:59:16] <valtido> nardev whichever you look at it, you will deff need a script to do that, so whether it bespoke or a plugin it's your call
[03:59:17] <Cork> siovene: http://jsfiddle.net/9sS84/
[03:59:39] <siovene> shoky, no, same website, all http.
[03:59:46] <shoky> also, what happens in other browsers
[04:00:17] <siovene> Cork, that delay thing sounds useful.
[04:00:36] <Cork> siovene: it is for testing
[04:00:41] <siovene> shoky, haven't tried yet. I'll try IE at some point before publishing the new code :)
[04:00:46] <Cork> but here the connection takes 5 second, and doesn't abort
[04:01:13] <Cork> siovene: and that is a basic pure jquery ajax call
[04:01:24] <Cork> and if that works for you, it means it is something in your code doing it
[04:01:45] <nardev> valtido, what do you think about this one? http://jsfiddle.net/paska/b23pd/1/
[04:02:55] <valtido> clever, but still, you need the dimentions, I would suggest that plug-in because it has been tested
[04:03:09] <valtido> and had more experiece in bugs u may run into
[04:03:19] <nardev> valtido, ok
[04:03:29] <valtido> if u have tooooo many plugins, then try to put them in the same file
[04:03:40] <daveaway> how do i do each() with everything that has the same class as this
[04:04:26] <daveaway> i got $('.nafrica, .wafrica').mouseenter(function(){  $(this).each(function(){ console.log('hello'); }....
[04:04:39] <TeraJL> is there any way to know if the style property came from a :focus selector from CSS? or a way to get the properties without ":focus" and test them with the ":focus" and check what properties came from a ":focus" on the css?
[04:04:51] <Cork> $(this.className.split(' ').join('.')).each()
[04:04:52] <daveaway> when i hover over nafrica.. i want it to find all the divs with CSS = nafrica
[04:05:02] <daveaway> to change the css
[04:05:10] <Cork> hmm needs a leading dot
[04:05:12] <daveaway> CSS*=class
[04:05:18] <Cork> $('.' + this.className.split(' ').join('.')).each()
[04:05:26] <daveaway> whaa
[04:05:38] <Cork> daveaway: if you want to just statically look for a class just do that instead
[04:05:50] <Cork> $('.nafrica').each()
[04:06:52] <daveaway> the first line is well over my head
[04:07:09] <Cork> it takes the class attribute from the current element
[04:07:23] <Cork> splits it on space and merge them to a string with dot as separation
[04:07:33] <Cork> and makes a selection with that as the selector
[04:07:39] <daveaway> but goddamn, it works.
[04:07:49] <Cork> <div class="foo bo bar">
[04:07:58] <Cork> becomes $('.foo.bo.bar')
[04:08:16] <daveaway> ah yes
[04:08:39] <daveaway> cheers
[04:17:04] <TigerParket> Hi everybody, i'm looking for a jQuery news plugin. i have a thumb and a short text, when i click i want to change another section with a big img and a long text. Any advice plz ?
[04:18:45] <seutje> plugin sounds overkill, pretty much just a click handler to show a sibling or something
[04:34:13] <ph88> how do i find an element on the current nesting level without selecting children ?
[04:36:11] <seutje> ph88: siblings()
[04:36:34] <seutje> andSelf() to include the element itself
[04:36:53] <ph88> thx seutje
[04:44:46] <TeraJL> how do i get all the classes form an element?
[04:46:42] <samuel02> TeraJl,  $(element).attr('class')
[04:46:53] <TeraJL> thanks
[04:47:10] <samuel02> it will return a string of all classes space separated
[04:47:35] <samuel02> so if you want to to more you'll have to turn it into an array with split
[04:50:25] <shree> hi
[04:50:54] <shree> hey
[05:27:41] <seutje> so quiet here today
[05:28:18] <DRSK> Well you can help me figure out why transitionend fails :D
[05:28:22] <Kal_crunchbang> yep now i got alot of questions
[05:30:33] <DRSK> I'm setting doingAnimation to false on transitionend. However this only works as intended the first go, on the others it's like the transition duration isn't refreshed, so it'll set it to false too fast.. :p
[05:31:43] <Kal_crunchbang> don't you need to refresh the page or div?
[05:31:53] <DRSK> o.O
[05:32:24] <Kal_crunchbang> yeah im new to jquery
[05:32:50] <Kal_crunchbang> all i know is $(#div).fadeout and fadein then a .load
[06:01:17] <seutje> oh man... I love zooming: jQuery($0).width(); /* 239 */ jQuery($0).css('width'); /* "237.98611450195313px" */
[06:06:22] <grafi> seutje what am i looking at :o
[06:12:00] <bberry> if i have two object arrays, how would i move one object from array 1 to array 2?
[06:12:11] <bberry> and remove it from array 1
[06:17:15] <bberry> could i do like, var item = array1[idx]; array1 = array1.slice(idx); array2.push(item);?
[06:30:50] <koneko> bberry, array1.splice(idx, 1);
[06:31:05] <seutje> grafi: few calls on a list item that's 1 of 4 in a UL, all set to  238px width in the CSS and zoomed out once
[06:31:06] <koneko> without "array1 = "
[06:31:24] <seutje> also, only item 3 reports the 239, all the rest report 238 as they should
[06:31:33] <grafi> funny
[06:31:53] <seutje> "let's round up by 2!"
[06:31:59] <koneko> .slice leaves the array in tact, doesn't modify it
[06:32:01] <seutje> and only on this one element
[06:38:36] <bberry> koeka: gotcha, thx!
[06:39:33] <bberry> wow
[06:39:46] <bberry> thats one of the worst typos ive done in a while
[06:39:53] <bberry> koneko*
[06:40:16] <koneko> No worries
[06:51:08] <g33kyboi> Hi
[06:53:04] <g33kyboi> I am having a challenge with disabling an input field after removing 'disabled' attribute. I have tried different ways but no success. Here: http://pastebin.com/fem6LSX5
[06:55:30] <g33kyboi> Pls any idea on what could be causing this behaviour?
[06:57:29] <bberry> g33kyboi: http://jsfiddle.net/Wksnd/
[06:57:39] <seutje> g33kyboi: not sure I understand the behavior here
[06:57:54] <seutje> like, it's disabled and onchange ur enabling it?
[06:58:30] <seutje> cause the basics work fine: http://jsfiddle.net/q6EVB/1/
[06:58:31] <bberry> oh. yeah i totally didnt read the question fully >.<
[06:58:59] <seutje> note that I added keyup cause change only fires onblur
[06:59:18] <seutje> for select/checkbox/radio, u might wanna use click or something
[07:00:57] <g33kyboi> seutje: I have a radio button group 'endcustom'. On click of one of the options 'after' an input text field should be enabled else should be disabled
[07:01:37] <seutje> yeah use click, change won't fire until you click somewhere else (on IE at least)
[07:02:38] <g33kyboi> okay. thanks
[07:02:38] <koneko> seutje, it should fire if it's a radio button group
[07:02:42] <robschmuecker> uGoMobi: Hi, you around?
[07:03:03] <koneko> g33kyboi, seutje http://jsfiddle.net/wbyCY/ like this
[07:03:10] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: hi!
[07:04:09] <robschmuecker> Hi buddy, got a little held up on my trip :) Starting to mod those icons.  Quick question, I remember when we spoke about it we agreed to do something in separate commits.  Do you perhaps remember what that was?!
[07:04:47] <robschmuecker> I think it might have been to parse out a lot of unnecessary </g> tags in the SVG's but my IIlustrator is doing that already.
[07:05:05] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: yeah it was about the cleanup
[07:05:45] <robschmuecker> ok - unfortunately that's happening automatically as I re-jig the icons to be square 14x14 and saving back as SVG.
[07:06:00] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: no worries
[07:06:08] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: it shouldn't be a problem
[07:06:17] <robschmuecker> ok cool, will crack on and get you the PR soon.  Thanks Jasper.
[07:06:55] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: was just thinking about in case we need to import in that Grunticon tool to export to PNG
[07:07:25] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: wasn't sure if the cleanup could cause issues
[07:07:50] <robschmuecker> uGoMobi: ok, I will save into a separate directory for now and test.
[07:08:15] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: BTW - you might want to join the #jqueryui-dev channel, that's where the Mobile dev team hangs out
[07:08:42] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: great, thanks for you help with the icons!
[07:08:44] <robschmuecker> uGoMobi: sure thing will do ;)
[07:08:58] <robschmuecker> uGoMobi: a pleasure.  Catch you soon.
[07:09:12] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: ok, later!
[07:16:42] <g33kyboi> koneko: thanks. COuld you pls give some explanations why the others didn't work?
[07:24:47] <koneko> g33kyboi, from .removeProp() documentation on api.jquery.com:    Note: Do not use this method to remove native properties such as checked, disabled, or selected. This will remove the property completely and, once removed, cannot be added again to element. Use .prop() to set these properties to false instead.
[07:25:32] <foobar321> How to display icon in jquerymobile footer ?
[07:25:51] <koneko> g33kyboi, As to why the change event didn't fire - no idea, it should as long as the value of the matched element changes.
[07:26:05] <koneko> That said, if you click a button, the value doesn't change
[08:00:04] <donta> I have been trying for the life of me to get jquery's autocomplete working... if anyone familar with it?
[08:00:24] <donta> s/if/is
[08:17:25] <donta> If anyone is interested in helping with it msg me, I am willing to pay
[08:19:52] <MrBandersnatch> So, I have an issue with the autocomplete in internet explorer 9. Seems as though with first page load it does not append the ul to the dom. thus making it not working. A refresh or even having the ie dbugger tool open seems to solve the issue. Has any one ran into this issue. It works in all other browsers.
[08:23:37] <donta> MrBandersnatch: welcome to the party ;) I am also having issues with autocomplete
[08:23:51] <donta> no response yet though, gl
[08:24:25] <donta> would something like modernizr help?
[08:26:12] <CAP1872> hi, can somebody help me? i am trying to use same plugin for 2 dialogs but i can only trigger one of them. this is the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/dKstV/
[08:28:24] <MrBandersnatch> donta: Same issue?
[08:29:10] <donta> MrBandersnatch: no, I am having a hard time figuring out how to get results from a remote database
[08:29:39] <donta> I've spent so much time on it, I'm willing to pay somebody to help me now... that way I can learn
[08:31:11] <MrBandersnatch> donta: What are you using to get the data?
[08:31:22] <MrBandersnatch> donta: is there an interface, api?
[08:31:39] <donta> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote
[08:31:44] <donta> MrBandersnatch: ^
[08:31:56] <donta> json
[08:33:02] <donta> I also want it to cach and the results to link to a page on the website, and return images relating to the pages
[08:33:29] <MrBandersnatch> The return from source url should be a json formated array.
[08:33:55] <MrBandersnatch> donta: If it is php, you should return json_encode on a proper array
[08:35:22] <donta> MrBandersnatch: I'm able to return simple results (based on the demo) but I can't seem to have them cach, link, or display images
[08:37:19] <donta> I'm using $items = array( for the array
[08:37:26] <donta> in the php file
[08:38:15] <MrBandersnatch> donta: for that you will want to override the _renderItem method. http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#custom-data
[08:39:29] <donta> MrBandersnatch: you lost me... I'm too much of a noob at jquery :(
[08:40:29] <donta> brb
[08:40:47] <MrBandersnatch> donta: essentailly follow that link and look at lines 66-70. This renders each line of the autocomplete. Here you can put in custom html.
[08:41:13] <MrBandersnatch> So, I have an issue with the autocomplete in internet explorer 9. Seems as though with first page load it does not append the ul to the dom. thus making it not working. A refresh or even having the ie dbugger tool open seems to solve the issue. Has any one ran into this issue. It works in all other browsers.
[08:42:53] <donta> back
[08:42:57] <donta> reading...
[08:52:54] <MrBandersnatch> donta: Please note the only line you should change is the inner contents of append on line 68.
[08:54:00] <donta> MrBandersnatch: and that's for the image, correct?
[08:54:57] <MrBandersnatch> Yes, here you can append any data you want to the li in the drop down list. What is displayed is how to change it to a link
[08:55:23] <MrBandersnatch> But you can put in an <img> if you wanted to and dynamically change the source
[08:56:32] <donta> ah, okay, I'm getting it now
[08:56:38] <donta> thank you
[08:57:53] <garndt> when an autocomplete field is created, is there anyway to tap into the mapping of the auto generated IDs with the objects they represent?  I have an autocomplete field and I would like to find out more details about the object the ID for the <a> represents.
[08:59:43] <donta> lol, is today autocomplete day or something?
[08:59:59] * donta had no idea so many people had issues with it
[09:00:00] <garndt> If it is, it seems like I showed up at the right time :)
[09:00:39] <donta> garndt: that's the only topic that has been mentioned since I've been on
[09:08:35] <MrBandersnatch> donta: Glad I could help
[09:09:15] <MrBandersnatch> garndt: Seems as though you are having the same problem as donta
[09:09:39] <MrBandersnatch> garndt: you should check out this page in the api. http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#custom-data check out line 66-70
[09:11:28] <garndt> MrBandersnatch: I was there and I can see how it builds the list elements, but I'm not sure how I would get the reverse of that.  Let's say I know an attribute about the original element provided in the 'source', how could I then find out the auto incremented ID that was generated?
[09:12:36] <MrBandersnatch> garndt: the id is auto appended to the a tag. Upon clicking the a tag in the li, it searches the value index in data
[09:13:00] <MrBandersnatch> garndt: you could upon click, grab the id and run a substr on the id
[09:13:36] <MrBandersnatch> garndt: id is prepended with ui-id-#
[09:14:03] <garndt> so, let's say I know that the ID is 'ui-id-1234' so the ID is '1234'...if I know that can I query something to find the object related to that ID and then find attributes about that object?
[09:14:16] <garndt> I assume jquery maintains some mapping between the auto generated IDs and the actual objects they represent
[09:17:08] <gumble> which is better form performance? $('#id input') or $('input[name="name"]')??
[09:17:16] <gumble> if I can't set an id for the input itself
[09:18:54] <duch_kazatel> gumble the first.
[09:20:09] <gumble> where do I find out about stuff like that?
[09:20:48] <duch_kazatel> https://www.google.com/search?q=jquery+efficient+selectors&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a
[09:20:49] <duch_kazatel> lol
[09:21:21] <gumble> ok I searched when to use which selector jquery
[09:21:22] <duch_kazatel> more specifically: http://jsperf.com/id-vs-class-vs-tag-selectors/2
[09:21:23] <gumble> :D thanks
[09:21:39] <duch_kazatel> np
[09:21:41] <MrBandersnatch> garndt: I don't think it is a mapping. I think it is an attached object
[09:25:09] <garndt> and is there an easy way I could get that attached object?
[09:25:25] <garndt> so based on knowing the ID, I could get the object that's attached to that element?
[09:25:35] <gumble> someone told me dont do tag#id but just #id. Can't find that on the internet. is that right?
[09:25:47] <duch_kazatel> gumble why did they tell you that?
[09:25:59] <duch_kazatel> gumble you could always test it.
[09:26:11] <gumble> here in the channel I posted code and someone wrote don't do that
[09:26:15] <gumble> just use the ids
[09:26:30] <mink> gumble, It's no point to use tag with id attribute
[09:26:45] <MrBandersnatch> garndt: So what are you precisely trying to do. There might be a btter way to acheive what you are trying to accomplish
[09:26:55] <mink> $("tag#id") is wrong
[09:27:05] <duch_kazatel> mink wat
[09:27:06] <gumble> duch_kazatel: how test it? and the thing is that only if it is fasted on my updated browser doesn't mean its for all
[09:27:10] <MrBandersnatch> mink: Ummm, no it is not
[09:27:21] <MrBandersnatch> mink: that is a valid css selector
[09:27:23] <gumble> i used that a lot already
[09:27:32] <gumble> i like it more because it makes it more readable for me
[09:27:42] <MrBandersnatch> gumble: jquery uses any valid css selector.
[09:27:43] <mink> MrBandersnatch, Whats point to use tag with #id?
[09:28:13] <MrBandersnatch> mink: there is no point, but it is not wrong.
[09:28:29] <gumble> the point it readabilty
[09:28:51] <gumble> e.g. input#name tells me more then #name mink
[09:28:52] <mink> MrBandersnatch, technically both work, but for Sizzle better should be only #id without tag
[09:29:06] <duch_kazatel> http://apmblog.compuware.com/2009/11/09/101-on-jquery-selector-performance/
[09:29:09] <gumble> so tag is slower??
[09:29:09] <MrBandersnatch> gumble: what mink is getting at is there should only be one element with a particular id. It is redundent to include the tag and does not add to readability
[09:29:41] <gumble> MrBandersnatch: does for me. but I don't do the sites I write js for. often the id's are just stupid
[09:29:53] <gumble> and with the tag I don't have to look what I am working for every time
[09:30:01] <duch_kazatel> I know a lot of folks who prepend selectors with tagnames.  i don't personally do it, but I see the point.
[09:30:03] <MrBandersnatch> gumble: it can be slower.
[09:30:18] <garndt> MrBandersnatch: thanks for your help, sorry I'm not terribly familiar with jquery.  There is a list of items that were retrieved from a database.  An array was built based on this and provided as the source to the autocomplete.  The autocomplete menu was created with the list elements that have <a> elements.  Now based on what I can see in the markup, I see
[09:30:18] <garndt> the auto generated ID and the text of the element, but is there a way that I could find out what ID represents a particular item based on another attribute I know about that item?
[09:30:52] <mink> gumble, maybe it is little slower. But difference is obviously too small to see that.      $("tag.classname") is allright.  $("tag#id") is technically good, but IMO is no point to use it like that
[09:30:55] <pixelgremlins> hey trying to learn ajax for my Laravel app -- I was reading that the 'delete' verb isn't supported on all browsers -- is there a way to use post and set a method of delete to make it cross browser?
[09:31:09] <MrBandersnatch> garndt: Oh yea, there are a couple of methods that get fired upon select. let me find the reference for you.
[09:31:24] <MrBandersnatch> garndt: it will return the object in javascript :D
[09:31:27] <gumble> ok thanks all!
[09:31:40] <garndt> well before selecting anything I would like to know which one to select
[09:31:50] <MrBandersnatch> gumble: I am agreeing with mink on that one
[09:31:52] <garndt> MrBandersnatch: I want to be able to know which one to select before even selecting something
[09:32:22] <MrBandersnatch> garndt: Like a default selected
[09:33:20] <MrBandersnatch> gumble: here is a reference to most valid selectors. http://help.dottoro.com/lctodmkm.php
[09:33:21] <garndt> MrBandersnatch: No.  I'm using selenium to automate the front end testing and I know the list of items that should be displayed in the autocomplete menu and I want to make sure the correct one is selected but to do so, I need to know the ID that was generated for that item.
[09:33:47] <MrBandersnatch> garndt: well that certainly changes things.
[09:34:03] <gumble> haha, exactly now I have the problem. I asked the guy that creates the form to please use normal id's this time and not generated stuff by some plugin like #text-ash13nalk1
[09:34:03] <JesseC> Anyone ever recieved an error like this before? "Uncaught TypeError: Object 3100 has no method 'apply'" It's coming from my google cdn hosted jquery
[09:34:04] <garndt> I'm sorry I wasn't clearer before
[09:34:13] <gumble> now he named 2 input fields with the same id
[09:34:31] <duch_kazatel> gumble you can't do that :(
[09:34:39] <MrBandersnatch> gumble: that is invalid html and will break css and javascript.
[09:35:27] <gumble> yap. I'll have to do it myself
[09:35:30] <MrBandersnatch> gumble: not to mention form submission in some rare cases
[09:35:43] <gumble> yes I also don't know how a front-end designer can come so such an idea
[09:36:00] <gumble> i normally do php but this time I have to evaluate the form with js
[09:36:24] <gumble> and then it is a problem if he calls them the same id -.-
[09:36:39] <duch_kazatel> wait are you doing all your form validation via JS?
[09:37:03] <MrBandersnatch> garndt: I am unsure. Your best bet is to do a search that will return one result. That way your data is limited to a particular set. the returned data from jquery is id auto append. The id will always change, even if you search the same thing twice.
[09:37:46] <petey_> If I create a variable like topbar = $('.top-bar-section a'); is there anyway I can select a certain class after that?
[09:37:58] <petey_> like topbar.link1
[09:38:04] <MrBandersnatch> gumble: please note, that although js is fun for form validation. It is easily bypassed.
[09:38:05] <duch_kazatel> topbar.find('.link1')
[09:38:13] <gumble> no I don't meant evaluation
[09:38:14] <petey_> I want to target a certain link inside the .top-bar-section a
[09:38:21] <gumble> yes I know
[09:38:24] <petey_> perfect, thanks
[09:38:32] <garndt> I understand the ID is autogenerated each time, which is why if I knew something more static about the item (such as another value/attribute), then I could find the ID that was generated for that item based on that
[09:38:47] <duch_kazatel> petey you should prepend jquery object vars with $ to help others differentiate in your code that's what those hold.
[09:38:51] <gumble> I just have to search through some stuff that I already load on the page via php in a div display=none
[09:39:00] <MrBandersnatch> garndt: Here is a solution. More like a hack.
[09:39:07] <gumble> no searching through db or input saved or anything. so it is fine with js
[09:39:24] <garndt> if I grabbed all the autogenerated IDs, is there a way to inspect each object attached to those IDs and query that object to see if it has an attribute that I'm looking for?
[09:39:31] <MrBandersnatch> garndt: You can always check a value in the _renderItem. The link I sent before, and if it matches append a selenium class.
[09:39:57] <MrBandersnatch> I don't think you can do it with selenium
[09:40:26] <MrBandersnatch> garndt: With javascript you can compare the html.
[09:40:57] <garndt> if I can use javascript to find this out, that is fine.  Ultimately I want to inspect the autocomplete list, evaluate all the objects tied to the  list elements, and if that list element contains an object that I want, I can then use selenium to select it based on that auto generated ID.  Now everything before selecting the list I'm fine with doing in
[09:40:57] <garndt> javascript as long as it's possible
[09:41:43] <garndt> there's no way based on the ID I could ask jquery to give me the object attached to it and then I could just inspect that object (in javascript of course)?
[09:42:15] <atpa8a> hello
[09:42:33] <petey_> duch_kaztel i do!
[09:42:39] <petey_> thank you for the help
[09:43:07] <atpa8a> how can i select the first one of the li?..
[09:43:35] <mink> atpa8a, $("li").eq(0);
[09:43:53] <atpa8a> trying... thanks!
[09:44:01] <mink> atpa8a, or $("li").first() maybe is better
[09:44:08] <atpa8a> nice!
[09:44:15] <atpa8a> exactly what i need!
[09:44:18] <atpa8a> thank you sir
[09:44:21] <mink> or both are the same, I dont know :)
[09:44:21] <atpa8a> or madam
[09:44:22] <mink> np.
[09:44:41] <atpa8a> first() looks more readable
[09:44:49] <MrBandersnatch> mink: why not use the :first psuedo selector
[09:44:58] <MrBandersnatch> $('li:first')
[09:45:18] <MrBandersnatch> That way you are not loading up the list of li jquery objects?
[09:45:24] <mink> MrBandersnatch, It's not good idea (IMO again) to use CSS pseudoselectors in jQuery selectors
[09:46:07] <duch_kazatel> why not?
[09:46:27] <MrBandersnatch> mink: it isn't
[09:46:31] <MrBandersnatch> mink: http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
[09:46:48] <MrBandersnatch> mink: it is jquery custom first content-filter.
[09:47:18] <mink> Alright guys, I was wrong :)
[09:47:25] <MrBandersnatch> mink ;)
[09:48:04] <airdem> i have an element object in a variable. what is the best way to select the object + all of its contents for css manipulation?
[09:48:07] <MrBandersnatch> duch_kazatel: psuedo selectors can cause issues if the browser does not support it. It can also add some minor overhead... But not much
[09:48:15] <duch_kazatel> Sure, I'm aware of that.
[09:48:31] <duch_kazatel> but as long as you know those and know not to run them against, say, 100s of elements at a time, you should be fine.
[09:48:32] <MrBandersnatch> garndt: I am still looking for an answer for you.
[09:49:15] <garndt> MrBandersnatch: thanks for your help with this
[09:49:19] <airdem> eleObject.add(this.children()).css(...); like this?
[09:49:55] <airdem> eleObject.add($(this).children()).css(...); right? :)
[09:51:16] <airdem> object.css(...); object.find('*').css(...); how do i combine these two?
[09:52:22] <petey_> can anyone point me in the right direction for why using .find() won't work for looking up the data-tab? http://jsbin.com/EWAHOZE/1/edit
[09:52:31] <mink> MrBandersnatch, duch_kazatel, sorry guys, I was right :)
[09:52:43] <mink> http://jsperf.com/jquery-first-vs-first-vs-eq-0-vs-0/5
[09:53:58] <airdem> PeterBooker, maybe topbar.find('li[data-tab="tab-1"]')
[09:54:35] <airdem> petey_,
[09:54:39] <airdem> PeterBooker, sorry
[09:54:50] <petey_> nope, unfortunately nothing
[09:55:58] <airdem> petey_, > is the problem
[09:56:15] <airdem> var topbar = $('.top-bar-section > ul > li'); remove the >
[09:56:26] <airdem> var topbar = $('.top-bar-section ul li');
[09:57:00] <airdem> or do you want to select the first li only?
[09:57:45] <airdem> dont forget to add "return false;" at the end of your click function
[09:58:34] <airdem> and you probably should assign the click functions to your <a> and not <li>
[09:58:40] <petey_> I'm not showing everything in the code but I have 4 different div's that are supposed to open up
[09:58:49] <petey_> right now im just testing it with data-tab=tab-1
[09:59:02] <airdem> $('.top-bar-section > ul > li') only contains the first li
[09:59:03] <petey_> so for now as long as I can get that 'yey' to display in console I'd be a happy camper
[09:59:07] <petey_> oh ok
[09:59:10] <airdem> so its not possible to fund the others
[09:59:19] <airdem> *find
[09:59:22] <petey_> Unfortunately it's not working even if I remove >
[09:59:40] <airdem> yes because you should assign the click function to <a>
[09:59:42] <airdem> and not li
[10:00:04] <airdem> and as i mentioned add "return false;" at the end of each click function that gets assigned to <a>
[10:00:23] <petey_> Be back in a sec
[10:01:27] <airdem> petey_, http://jsbin.com/EWAHOZE/3/edit
[10:02:43] <airdem> petey_, http://jsbin.com/EWAHOZE/4/edit with >
[10:03:03] <MrBandersnatch> mink: I can't even read that
[10:03:32] <MrBandersnatch> If you want your selector to work really fast, you would use plain javascript. That is all I got from that
[10:04:36] <mink> MrBandersnatch, yes, but still .first() / .eq(0)  is better than ":first"
[10:04:41] <mink> nevermind
[10:05:44] <MrBandersnatch> mink: I see it now. Strange.
[10:06:35] <duch_kazatel> mink let me clarify - I know that there are some MUCH faster selectors available.  I often use them, but there's something to be said when working in a large codebase and handling conventions/readability/etc.
[10:07:19] <duch_kazatel> when crafting from scratch, I generally run sanity tests to make sure I'm doing things the "faster" way while trying to maintain readability via comments.
[10:07:43] <MrBandersnatch> mink: I am unsure how that is possible though. I mean .eq(0) has to obstantiate all the elements in the parent selector. so you have ten million objects to create. Only selecting the first and creating one object should be faster.
[10:07:56] <mink> Yes guys, I didnt wanna be rude. I just read that somewhere and I told you guys
[10:08:21] <MrBandersnatch> garndt: I can't seem to find a solution to your issue.
[10:08:47] <MrBandersnatch> You can get the menu element with the list of items
[10:09:04] <duch_kazatel> mink it's totally cool. it's good to spread the truth of the word ;) but there IS something ot be said about readability and convention in codebases.
[10:10:02] <garndt> MrBandersnatch: thanks for looking into it.  I appreciate it.
[10:10:05] <mink> Ok :)   I gotta go
[10:10:09] <mink> cu gyus
[10:10:12] <duch_kazatel> enjoy.
[10:10:53] <MrBandersnatch> garndt: Found it, http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-response
[10:11:32] <MrBandersnatch> garndt: this will return all items from the search where you can process the returned data in the order they will appear
[10:11:48] <MrBandersnatch> garndt: hope you were still here to read this
[10:13:28] <ha1331> J #jquerymobile
[10:17:31] <airdem> will .css({ cursor: 'auto' }); also change inline style ?
[10:18:22] <bigbugjava> airdem test it, lol
[10:31:17] <eigentor> Hm I have a Plugin that does a slide-down toggle http://www.nobila.de/
[10:31:21] <eigentor> in the top right corner
[10:31:44] <eigentor> Now I want to add a class to the box when it is toggled open without overwriting the original funciton
[10:32:04] <eigentor> because the original function is inside a vendor plugin that I do not want to hack
[10:32:29] <eigentor> So basically how do I react to this function in my custom script and thus add the class
[10:32:48] <eigentor> this is the original little toggle function http://pastebin.com/51ERDJgc
[10:33:57] <MrBandersnatch> jquery autocomplete fails to initilize on first load of script
[10:34:05] <MrBandersnatch> Has any one else had this issue?
[10:34:27] <MrBandersnatch> the create event never happens
[10:34:35] <MrBandersnatch> This is only in ie9
[10:36:23] <MrBandersnatch> eigentor: Are you familiar with casting jquery events?
[10:36:34] <petey_> thanks airdem ! this is great!
[10:36:35] <eigentor> MrBandersnatch: no
[10:36:39] <eigentor> but eager to learn
[10:36:48] <eigentor> if it is not totally rocket science
[10:37:15] <airdem> petey_, happy to help
[10:38:34] <gumble> why do I get unexpected token [ on this: 		var form_values = {}; var form_values['rR'] = 0; ??
[10:39:00] <MrBandersnatch> eigentor: I am unfamiliar with the plugin. Do they have a callback you can check?
[10:39:33] <eigentor> uh callback
[10:39:44] <eigentor> but maybe I am thinking much too complicated
[10:39:59] <eigentor> I could just add a class toggle independent from the other function
[10:40:08] <eigentor> I mean you click you add the class.
[10:40:15] <eigentor> you click again you remove it
[10:40:21] <MrBandersnatch> eigentor: Yes you could do that. it would work.
[10:40:30] <MrBandersnatch> that would be the simpliest solution.
[10:40:34] <eigentor> because toggle is toggle, only two states
[10:41:28] <MrBandersnatch> Very true. Why did you go with a plugin just to do a slide down?
[10:43:46] <eigentor> MrBandersnatch: this is a complete login thing
[10:43:52] <eigentor> it provides all kinds of stuff
[10:44:02] <eigentor> If I say drupal I might make you run
[10:44:09] <eigentor> so I avoided that :)
[10:44:49] <eigentor> I can just check for the display: none of the form element that is hidden
[10:44:54] <eigentor> that will be the simplest
[10:46:49] <MrBandersnatch> Yea, actually that would work great.
[11:12:36] <FernandoBasso> I am using uglifyjs, and it is removing code starting with $. Any ideas?

[11:16:45] <Bloomberg> Hi guys!!
[11:16:53] <|PiP|> i found this plugin: https://github.com/gnarf/jquery-ajaxQueue   to queue ajax requests
[11:17:06] <|PiP|> wanted to add in some delay between requests as well
[11:18:34] <winsoff> WELL, HERE I AM BEING AN IDIOT.
[11:19:05] <winsoff> I want to parse 4chan's JSON API using Javascript.  Is the Jquery library really where I should start?  Does it make the evaluation easier for an idiot like me?
[11:19:51] <Bloomberg> How can I return a value from js file to another function for use it?
[11:24:32] <mdev> test
[11:24:35] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/HPcee/
[11:24:40] <Bloomberg> This will be the example
[11:24:43] <mdev> I need integer value of $chkbox.is(':checked')
[11:24:47] <mdev> 1 or 0, how I get that?
[11:24:52] <mdev> as that returns true or false
[11:25:56] <_rgn> !!$chkbox.is(':checked')
[11:26:36] <_rgn> oh lol nvm
[11:31:49] <rmcdaniel> how can I use jquerymobile and chosenjs? my select box gets themed by jam when I try to use them both
[11:33:16] <amarsaini> if i use same script on two html pages , whether request for script will be two times or once
[11:36:27] <rmcdaniel> fyi data-role="none" will prevent jqm from styling an element
[11:41:28] <kevinold> hi all I'm working with an app stuck on 1.4.4 for a while and I am trying to improve page load performance in IE 7/8.  I've read (http://encosia.com/dont-let-jquerys-document-ready-slow-you-down/) that moving .live()'s out of ready() will improve and it appears to do so.  I'm wondering if changing .live()'s to .delegate()'s would be another good idea?
[11:50:30] <duch_kazatel> kevinold are you binding a lot of event listeners?
[11:52:39] <pcoder> Hi, Can anyone please let me know if I can make a head request using $.ajax() function?
[11:52:57] <kevinold> yeah, I think so, for a page with a table with 80 rows in it, there are 40 total - click(), live(), bind()
[11:53:26] <kevinold> and it's a very legacy app so things were thrown together
[11:53:54] <rmcdaniel> do you really need individual bindings like that?
[11:54:10] <rmcdaniel> can't you just do it on the whole table and detect what was clicked?
[11:55:59] <kevinold> rmcdaniel: these events are for lots of other things on the page too, but yes I'm consolidating where I can
[11:56:12] <duch_kazatel> kevinold use event delegation.
[11:56:20] <duch_kazatel> bind one listener, go from there.
[11:56:25] <duch_kazatel> that should help a little.
[11:56:45] <kevinold> duch_kazatel: thanks will do
[11:58:12] <duch_kazatel> if you can, update to a newer version of jquery and check out the syntax for .on() that supports delegation.
[12:02:57] <kevinold> duch_kazatel: yes, I'd love to be running a newer version, but stuck on this version until I can upgrade it.  very large app, very legacy.
[12:03:11] <kevinold> duch_kazatel: can I use .delegate() in 1.4.4 though?
[12:17:47] <streblo> has anyone ever experienced an issue where $.ajax will throw away the url you provide and instead make ajax requests to the browser's current location's url
[12:18:31] <streblo> ie, i'm on /home in the browser, and a call like $.ajax({ url: '/not/home', ... }) will make the request to /home
[12:19:44] <eddiemonge> streblo: no. are you passing in the actual string or a variable?
[12:19:54] <streblo> eddiemonge: a variable
[12:20:03] <streblo> this is through the twitter typeahead library
[12:20:15] <streblo> i put a breakpoint on their ajax call and the url is set correctly
[12:20:37] <streblo> but then it still makes a request to /home instead of /not/home
[12:21:27] <eddiemonge> why not step through it to see whats going on?
[12:21:50] <zarac> Yo folks! > )
[12:23:39] <streblo> eddiemonge: that's what i'm doing, and at no point does the url change
[12:23:44] <streblo> its still /not/home
[12:24:17] <streblo> i step through until the function call ends, the debugger finishes stepping through, and then a request is made to the wrong url
[12:24:18] <pixelgremlins> hey I have jquery.ajax working- - basically adding a row to a table, and deleting rows -- BUT when I add a row - that row cannot be deleted unless the page is refreshed, even though the new row has the exact same selector... I can delete stale items in same table w/ same a.ajax selector
[12:24:46] <streblo> pixelgremlins: how are you trying to delete it
[12:25:29] <pixelgremlins> I have success: function(ev){ row.slideUp('normal', function() { row.remove(); }); }
[12:25:46] <pixelgremlins> var row = $(this).closest('tr');
[12:26:14] <pixelgremlins> it works on previously added items.. just not new items added by my other ajax on page..
[12:26:40] <streblo> what is "this"
[12:26:43] <pixelgremlins> Adding rows via : success: function(ev){
[12:26:43] <pixelgremlins>               $('#supply-list tr:last').after('<tr><td>' + ev.name + '</td><td>' + ev.description +'</td><td><a href="#" class="ajax"  data-id="' + ev.id +'"><i class="icon-remove"></i></a></td></tr>');
[12:26:58] <pixelgremlins> hold on -- I'll just paste it all
[12:27:04] <streblo> dpaste.com
[12:28:03] <pixelgremlins> http://paste.laravel.com/11gc
[12:29:53] <streblo> pixelgremlins: does the success function fire?
[12:30:58] <streblo> my suggestion would be to put a debugger in your success function
[12:31:08] <streblo> and inspect 'row', and see if its defined as you expect
[12:31:18] <streblo> and try running the code manually
[12:32:10] <pixelgremlins> both success functions fire -- but AFTER adding a new row, then deleting the new row does not fire
[12:34:04] <pixelgremlins> so basically the a.ajax doesn't recognize the new trs that the button.ajax method inserted..
[12:37:12] <eddiemonge> pixelgremlins: you need to delegate
[12:37:25] <eddiemonge> at the moment you define those click handlers, the new elements dont exist
[12:37:59] <eddiemonge> you need something like $('#supply-list').on('click', 'a.ajax' ....
[12:38:38] <duch_kazatel> you can only bind to elements that all ready exist - delegation binds to something that exists and recognizes events that bubble up later one.
[12:42:30] <pixelgremlins> ok thanks that worked
[12:57:01] <JesseC> Anyone ever recieved an error like this before? "Uncaught TypeError: Object 3100 has no method 'apply'" It's coming from my google cdn hosted jquery
[12:57:22] <duch_kazatel> JesseC fiddle to trigger the error?
[12:57:26] <eddiemonge> JesseC: its most likely an error in your code
[12:57:36] <eddiemonge> have you tried jshinting it?
[12:57:59] <JesseC> eddiemonge: yeah, using phpstorm, it jshints everything, it's all normal
[12:58:32] <JesseC> duch_kazatel: I dont' know what js the error is coming from, the error only references the jquery.js hosted by google
[12:58:57] <zarac> It seems $.ajax removes the username:password part from the data.url (http://foo:bar@example.com becomes http://example.com). Is there a way to get jquery to NOT do this?
[12:59:56] <duch_kazatel> JesseC err, you should be able to stack trace in chrome dev tools or firebug to see where the error originated.
[13:00:23] <eddiemonge> zarac: you could do it the correct way
[13:00:28] <duch_kazatel> it sounds like you're running the apply method on a non-jquery object.
[13:00:37] <eddiemonge> zarac: look at username/password http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:00:40] <JesseC> duch_kazatel: the stack trace is shows, also references only jquery.js
[13:00:54] <JesseC> duch_kazatel: x.event.dispatch and v.handle
[13:01:41] <duch_kazatel> JesseC can't really help then - without seeing code I'd be shooting in the dark.
[13:02:39] <JesseC> Yeah, I've never seen an error come up that didn't reference at least a part of something I did. It seems firebug expands a little on it though
[13:02:47] <JesseC> TypeError: i.handler.apply is not a function
[13:03:24] <JesseC> ah yeah, that error brings up better search results. :)
[13:03:58] <zarac> eddiemonge: Why is the way I'm doing it not correct? It's basic HTTP stuff. From what i read the username/password fields in the ajax object are for when the server requests authentication with the WWW-Authenticate header. It just complicates things. Once again, why is what i'm doing not correct?
[13:04:03] <duch_kazatel> I've seen stuff like that before.  usually has to do with something not correctly getting passed around.
[13:04:11] <zarac> eddiemonge: And thanks.. for your response. ; )
[13:05:32] <eddiemonge> zarac: because those fields are specifically for what you are trying to do
[13:06:02] <eddiemonge> thats what foo:bar@url is
[13:07:12] <zarac> eddiemonge: I've tried setting those already.. it doesn't help. :& (i'm doing cross-origin stuff which complicates this a bit).
[13:08:30] <eddiemonge> zarac: do you have cors setup?
[13:11:29] <zarac> eddiemonge: eddiemonge Somewhat... ; )  Access-Control-Allow-Origin is set to * (which i think i read somewhere might 'cause troubles with authentication..?).
[13:12:01] <eddiemonge> its server and front end setup needed
[13:15:00] <zarac> eddiemonge: Uhmm. i think it just got it working.. by setting the "Authorizaion" header to "Basic " + btoa('user:pass')
[13:17:55] <zarac> eddiemonge: Setting the 'Authorization' header does the trick, fyi.
[13:27:45] <clime> hey is there a vertical carousel with fluent (non-discrete) scrolling of images by mousewheel?
[13:28:35] <clime> by non-discrete I mean that it can be scrolled e.g. half an image
[13:28:51] <clime> or any height basically
[13:29:26] <zarac> clime: Do you know of a horizontal one? Perhaps it's easy enough to just switch x and y? : 0
[13:29:55] <clime> zarac: i dont know even horizontal:)
[13:30:37] <zarac> : )
[13:30:47] <zarac> well, don't know of one, sorry. GL : )
[13:31:19] <petey_> Is there a reason why I'd want to reset via jquery over the html built in reset button?
[13:41:43] <culh> I'm trying to make a quick check for unsaved form data and one that doesn't use window.onbeforeunload event. This is what I have so far: $("form").live('focusout', function(event) { (...) });  // but then I lose the event triggered, as in: if the focusout comes from the user clicking on a link, that action is lost.
[13:42:54] <NoiseEee> culh: then monitor the clicks on <a> as well?  also, stop using live()
[13:44:33] <ericx2x> hey guys, i have this map tha is being rendered through some third party library called mapsvp.. my client wants me to edit he look of the map so that united states has state abbreviations. Does anyone know how to do this? http://unipowerco.com/reps-distributors-demo-test
[13:45:37] <ericx2x> I simply don't know where to begin.
[13:46:58] <g33kyboi> Hi
[13:49:08] <g33kyboi> I don't know my this is so. I have a function that takes string values (representing date and time) to create a date object. But it ends up outputing dates totally different from the input. http://pastebin.com/EKDy8CGQ
[13:53:48] <rmah> so, I set the css font-style to "oblique"
[13:53:58] <rmah> but when I query it, it comes back "italic"
[13:53:59] <rmah> wtf?
[13:56:03] <duch_kazatel> you sure it's not getting overridden somehow?
[13:56:36] <rmah> if I look at the object in the chrome debugger, it shows the font-style as oblique
[13:56:56] <rmah> but if I do $(".foo").css("font-style") it comes back as italic
[13:57:12] <rmah> my question is... is this a jquery thing or a browser thing
[13:57:14] <rmah> ?
[13:57:26] <duch_kazatel> looking.
[13:57:38] <duch_kazatel> sounds like a jquery thing...
[13:59:52] <duch_kazatel> because oblique is a valid style.
[14:00:05] <rmah> hmm
[14:00:10] <rmah> damn jquery css filtering
[14:00:28] <duch_kazatel> have an example in a fiddle?
[14:00:47] <rmah> no, but I guess I could whip one up
[14:01:49] <duch_kazatel> local test returns "oblique" for oblique text.
[14:04:42] <rmah> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/s7S57/1/
[14:04:52] <rmah> check it out, it also munges the font-size
[14:05:28] <duch_kazatel> I get a munged font-size, but style is "oblique"
[14:05:29] <rmah> http://jsfiddle.net/s7S57/2/
[14:05:41] <rmah> it also munges the weight, converts 700 to "bold"
[14:05:46] <duch_kazatel> not for me.
[14:05:46] <rmah> duch_kazatel: what browser?
[14:05:49] <duch_kazatel> firefox
[14:05:57] <rmah> god dammit
[14:06:00] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaahahahaha
[14:06:01] <duch_kazatel> chrome.
[14:06:03] <duch_kazatel> so cute.
[14:06:17] <rmah> FUCK ME
[14:06:19] <duch_kazatel> the font-size I can MAYBE see.
[14:06:25] <duch_kazatel> even IE reports style correctly.
[14:06:45] <rmah> thing is the official thing for helvetica IS oblique, not italic
[14:07:03] <duch_kazatel> looks like chrome treats them both the same.
[14:07:05] <rmah> awe man
[14:07:08] <rmah> this is gonna be a pita
[14:07:12] <duch_kazatel> that's pretty funny.
[14:07:13] <duch_kazatel> whyfor?
[14:07:29] <rmah> I have to save the styles and render the text on the back end with imagemagick
[14:07:42] <duch_kazatel> just use italic/.
[14:07:46] <duch_kazatel> that should be fine.
[14:08:12] <rmah> I have a little util that creates font meta-info for webfonts and for image magick
[14:08:22] <rmah> and that says oblique because, well, that's what it is
[14:08:27] <rmah> dammit
[14:08:32] <duch_kazatel> ohg.
[14:08:34] <duch_kazatel> *oh
[14:08:42] <rmah> the weight's area also gonna have to be mapped
[14:08:54] <duch_kazatel> wowzer that's bad.
[14:09:45] <rmah> I hate it when programmers try to be smart
[14:09:53] <rmah> they only create trouble for other people
[14:09:56] <TheIronSky> Okay
[14:10:01] <TheIronSky> Thanks for your opinion
[14:10:17] <duch_kazatel> lol
[14:10:52] <rmah> hey, let me rant and rave for a few minutes at least :-(
[14:11:17] <rmah> getting text to match on browsers vs imagemagick is such a PITA
[14:11:31] <duch_kazatel> wait are you going pixel-perfect?
[14:11:39] <rmah> you wouldn't believe the bullshit involved in getting word wrap on imagemagick
[14:11:59] <rmah> duch_kazatel: that's not really do-able, but as close as possible
[14:12:12] <rmah> getting italic/oblique right is pretty basic though
[14:12:16] <grafi> oô
[14:12:50] <grafi> scrolls up to see whats going on
[14:16:41] <grafi> rmah sounds like a fun project :p
[14:17:02] <rmah> not really
[14:17:20] <rmah> I'm starting to wonder if I should have done this in flash
[14:17:28] <duch_kazatel> never.
[14:17:35] <grafi> did I forget my sarcasm sign again?
[14:17:53] <grafi> im wondering why you would ever do what you are doing ^^
[14:21:14] <rmcdaniel> does anyone know of a better autocomplete for mobile than what jqm has?
[14:21:19] <rmah> grafi: you can't generate proofs to print on industrial equipment using a browser
[14:21:28] <rmah> that's why
[14:21:47] <grafi> but nevertheless you are trying to? ^^
[14:21:53] <duch_kazatel> "jqm" as in jquery mobile?
[14:23:17] <rmah> grafi: no, the mock ups are being done on the web
[14:23:25] <rmah> by clients of the client
[14:23:40] <grafi> still sounds less than ideal to me, hence the PITA ^^
[14:23:42] <jeffsmykil> How do you listen for the onSelect on a datepicker widget?
[14:23:44] <rmah> this way, they can fire the graphic "artists" who are doing many of them now
[14:23:56] <rmah> grafi: of course
[14:26:21] <rmcdaniel> duch_kazatel: yes
[14:44:21] <culh> NoiseEee: show me how to detect a focused out form from a <a> click event
[14:44:49] <culh> nnnnnnot possible, I think
[14:48:03] <culh> ?
[14:49:50] <JesseC> Anyone here using jquery reel? -> https://github.com/pisi/Reel
[14:53:13] <duch_kazatel> culh wat
[14:57:18] <culh> I'm trying to make a quick check for unsaved form data and one that doesn't use window.onbeforeunload event. This is what I have so far: $("form").on('focusout', function(event) { (...) });  // but then I lose the event triggered, as in: if the focusout comes from the user clicking on a link, that action is lost.
[14:57:50] <culh> That's the concern, but I was losing the event becouse I was alerting a msg
[14:59:01] <culh> imo using alert("YOU ARE A DUMB USER!") still is the best practice for unsaved form data
[14:59:28] <duch_kazatel> i really can't understand what your problem is.  have a fiddle or something?
[14:59:34] <culh> even a half blind grandpa can see that
[14:59:49] <culh> problem: users navigating before saving form data.
[15:00:01] <duch_kazatel> "save" as in "submit"?
[15:00:06] <culh> right
[15:00:08] <duch_kazatel> because it's the user's problem.
[15:00:17] <culh> that's dumb
[15:00:25] <duch_kazatel> you're trying to prevent them from navigating away from the page?
[15:00:32] <culh> you're selling a service and the service has to be complete.
[15:01:04] <duch_kazatel> sure.  validate what they input and toss an error if they didn't submit complete info. trying to prevent them from leaving the page?
[15:01:06] <duch_kazatel> wowzer.
[15:01:15] <duch_kazatel> maybe asking them to confirm.
[15:01:27] <culh> yes, but only whem there's unsaved form data. User accesses the form, changes his stuff and navigates out without saving (submitting)
[15:01:37] <duch_kazatel> bummer for them.
[15:01:50] <culh> just cleared the problem, though. sort of
[15:02:00] <duch_kazatel> autosave for them on blur of each input.
[15:02:12] <culh> will check back after teh users tell me it's a good methodology
[15:02:20] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:02:28] <duch_kazatel> preventing people from leaving is a terrible idea.
[15:02:44] <duch_kazatel> asking them to confirm that's what they want to do because they didn't save might be ok.
[15:02:54] <culh> you can't ever assume what you're doing will help untill the people to whom it's designed for actually tell you it's helping
[15:03:15] <duch_kazatel> congrats?
[15:03:20] <culh> feedback!
[15:03:31] <culh> yes I need my b33r
[15:03:35] <culh> 0.O
[15:04:03] <duch_kazatel> you're being really hostile to end users.
[15:04:05] <duch_kazatel> but whatever.
[15:11:05] * jphase loathes sites where he has to double click the back button to leave
[15:11:16] <duch_kazatel> agreed.
[15:11:26] <duch_kazatel> don't munge with the back button too much.
[15:11:28] <duch_kazatel> leave states alone.
[15:12:08] <duch_kazatel> if you need to screw with them, make sure you're not messing too much with conventions.
[15:15:13] <culh> ye, jumped into another problem
[15:15:51] <culh> the $(form).focusout() event is triggered everytime I change input fields using tab
[15:16:46] <duch_kazatel> Culh look at unblur
[15:17:15] <culh> Gonna have to do with discrete messages only
[15:17:28] <duch_kazatel> huh?>
[15:17:33] <culh> @dom
[15:17:44] <culh> instead of a rude alert()
[15:18:09] <duch_kazatel> you mean inline notifications next to inputs?
[15:18:47] <culh> maybe, maybe at a common information place at the layout, where the users are expecting messages
[15:18:56] <culh> whichever suits better
[15:19:51] <duch_kazatel> the right of form fields with red text and highlights is pretty common now.
[15:20:11] <culh> I already placed different input colors for mandatory+filled(green), mandatory+unfilled(red) and whatever(grey)
[15:21:04] <culh> stylish greed/red, not a carnival ;)
[15:21:04] <duch_kazatel> You still should reinforce.
[15:21:11] <duch_kazatel> after submission.
[15:21:15] <duch_kazatel> or on attempt to submit.
[15:21:24] <culh> backend checks after submiting, of course?
[15:21:31] <duch_kazatel> if should.
[15:21:34] <duch_kazatel> or frontend on submit.
[15:21:41] <duch_kazatel> and backend as a fallback.
[15:24:16] <culh> getting the obvious parts done first
[15:24:27] <culh> it's a cms, so everything is viral
[15:24:34] <culh> (almost) everything
[15:24:38] <duch_kazatel> "viral"?
[15:25:09] <culh> as is: these are changes at class levels, not module levels
[15:25:42] <culh> as in: they affect the operation of all modules
[15:25:50] <duch_kazatel> kay
[15:28:22] <JesseC> Does anyone understand why this wouldn't work in the console? jQuery('#img-testing').reel('frame')
[15:28:23] <JesseC> http://jsbin.com/UzIcuRO/1/edit?html,console,output
[15:29:03] <JesseC> The reel make the image in output draggable from left to right, works as intended
[15:29:46] <JesseC> Except that the ability to grab values with the aformentioned selector simply returns "Cannot read property 'frame' of null"
[15:32:14] <duch_kazatel> why not run that in the JavaScript panel instead?
[15:33:39] <JesseC> duch_kazatel: just didn't think about it, I was using the console before I added it all to jsbin, I'll make the update
[15:34:20] <duch_kazatel> one of the reasons i prefer jsfiddle.
[15:35:12] <JesseC> I was going to use jsfiddle, but it doesn't have a displayable console does it?
[15:35:26] <JesseC> other than browser console I suppose
[15:37:06] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[15:41:20] <JesseC> duch_kazatel: here's the same thing in jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/SFwUk/
[15:41:33] <RavenHursT> Would someone PLEASE explain this SH*% to me?? http://jsfiddle.net/FZ7Fx/1/
[15:41:58] <RavenHursT> There's clearly a <style> tag in there, and yet jQuery just ignores it??
[15:42:10] <JesseC> duch_kazatel: https://github.com/pisi/Reel/blob/master/jquery.reel.js#L1779
[15:42:37] <linagee_> does anyone know how to make jquery-mobile not bind to a href's? :(
[15:42:37] <JesseC> duch_kazatel: that line in the reel source is what I'm basing this test from
[15:43:17] <linagee_> and I'm not talking about ajaxEnabled/linkBindingEnabled/hashListeningEnabled/pushStateEnabled. I mean literally not parsing links.
[15:43:38] <RavenHursT> Where's Resig when you need him dangit
[15:43:43] <linagee_> (I have a single page application and jquery mobile is making the whole thing look like it reloads when I click a link.)
[15:44:21] <duch_kazatel> JesseC not famniliar with the plugin, but it looks like you're using it wrong.
[15:44:33] <duch_kazatel> you probably have to instantiate it, then check the value on an event.
[15:44:55] <duch_kazatel> JesseC also check your selector.  you're using a div.
[15:44:59] <duch_kazatel> the thing is an IMG.
[15:45:05] <JesseC> It's instantiated with the data attributes, you can test the scroll
[15:45:13] <JesseC> the div is created by the plugin
[15:45:19] <JesseC> using the same id as the image
[15:45:20] <zakj> RavenHursT: you're using find, which searches for children; you want filter instead.
[15:45:36] <JesseC> I've tested selecting the div, the image, the classes, nothign works
[15:45:46] <duch_kazatel> let me check again.
[15:45:55] <JesseC> However you can do jquery.reel.instances and see the object and frame count with firebug
[15:46:16] <JesseC> but that doesn't work with jsbin or jsfiddle, have to run it locally for some reason
[15:46:18] <RavenHursT> Zakj.. ok.. but $added.filter('style').remove() doesn't work.. .find() does, on children.. how can I accomplish the same thing w/ .filter()?
[15:48:24] <duch_kazatel> JesseC i wonder if it's something else because your selector isn't matching anything on the page.
[15:49:22] <zakj> RavenHursT: remove removes an element from its parent in the dom; the style element in your dom there has no parent. you could wrap the whole thing in a div (and then use find/remove)
[15:49:55] <RavenHursT> zakj: arg... was worried you were gonna say that.
[15:51:06] <linagee_> so much click binding with jquery mobile. :(
[15:52:54] <JesseC> duch_kazatel: typoed it, even so it doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/SFwUk/1/
[15:53:09] <JesseC> duch_kazatel: updated it to make sure it matches, then run the .frame and it logs undefined
[15:53:43] <JesseC> duch_kazatel: woot, nm, think I got it
[15:53:50] <JesseC> duch_kazatel: I needed to add img behind the id
[15:54:01] <JesseC> because it adds that div and jacks it up
[15:55:24] <JesseC> duch_kazatel: thanks
[15:56:27] <diverdude> i want to set focus on element with id: #myanchor using jquery. How do i do that?
[15:59:38] <jphase> $('#myanchor').focus();
[16:02:02] <diverdude> jphase, i tried that...and it dont work :(
[16:02:38] <jphase> diverdude: check for errors in your console then perhaps, confirm that console.log($('#myanchor'))  returns a length of 1
[16:02:47] <jphase> .focus() is the correct method for that
[16:04:37] <diverdude> jphase, no it dont work...is it perhaps because #myanchor is a div?? <div id="myanchor">...</div>
[16:06:20] <jphase> hm, why you're calling a div an anchor is an entirely different issue, but you might actually be setting focus without knowing... try console.log($(document.activeElement)) after you set focus
[16:06:46] <pixelpimp> i'm sure it's working but not doing anything of merit
[16:06:56] <jphase> yeah, that's what I was thinking as well :\
[16:07:13] <pixelpimp> are you trying to focus something inside #myanchor?
[16:07:21] <jphase> diverdude: after you set focus, try something like... console.log($('#myanchor').is(':focus'));   if that returns true then it's focused
[16:07:30] <diverdude> i just want to scroll the page to where the div starts
[16:07:37] <jphase> oh
[16:07:45] <jphase> you should just animate that then
[16:08:45] <pixelpimp> you can update $(window).scrollTop() to do that
[16:08:47] <jphase> diverdude: $('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $('#myanchor').position().top}, 'slow');  for exmaple
[16:09:58] <clime> hey anyone familar with jquery plugin carouFredSel?
[16:26:28] <ericandrewlewis> there's no good kerning solution for the web, right? just lettering.js and it's entourage
[16:28:47] <jedimind> persistive enforced kerning is sort of dying off
[16:29:02] <jedimind> there are a plethora of devices and variables and ultimately should just let the device handle things
[16:29:55] <ericandrewlewis> do devices have a rubric for kerning per font?
[16:30:03] <jedimind> no
[16:30:09] <duch_kazatel> lolnope.  and i wouldn't worry about it anyway
[16:30:55] <duch_kazatel> so really, your good kerning solution is to not worry about it too much.
[16:31:00] <andras> hello src="/js/jquery-1.10.2.min.js" its also loads /js/jquery-1.10.2.min.map Request Method:GET Status Code:302 Redirect   its starnge since the file is there..... any idea how to resolve this ? thanks andras
[16:32:02] <ericandrewlewis> the kerning plugins i've seen say you should define kerning for a string - a la lettering.js
[16:32:55] <ericandrewlewis> but i imagine you could write a kerning spec for a font, and then parse any element's content and fix it up according to the spec
[16:34:00] <duch_kazatel> ericandrewlewis lol "spec"
[16:38:47] <dwarder> between this 3 functions, how do i pass params to each other
[16:38:59] <dwarder> http://jsfiddle.net/zerkms/zJhph/
[16:50:02] <diverdude> if i have a <div> with a lot of content and i call empty() on that div, all content is removed and page naturally shrinks down. is it possible to postpone that shrink so that i can first empty the div, then insert new content and then shrink it in the end if its to big for the new content?
[16:50:45] <duch_kazatel> diverdude check out http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[16:51:21] <duch_kazatel> i assume you're working on a case where you'd like to prevent a pagescroll if possible?
[16:58:41] <LeBlaaanc> Anyone know how I can get whether a given element has been "scrolled passed" ?
[16:59:05] <LeBlaaanc> I was going to do it based on math but I can't even seem to get the proper viewport height using $(window).height() so now I'm stuck
[17:01:13] <duch_kazatel> LeBlaaanc that should work fine...
[17:02:19] <grafi> I DOESNT WORK
[17:02:23] <grafi> xD
[17:02:51] <diverdude> duch_kazatel, ahhh replacewith looks nice
[17:04:37] * grafi is bored
[17:07:34] <duch_kazatel> same here.
[17:07:38] <dwarder> grafi: wanna me to challenge you?
[17:07:43] <dwarder> ;)
[17:08:02] <dwarder> between this 3 functions, how do i pass params to each other
[17:08:06] <dwarder> http://jsfiddle.net/zerkms/zJhph/
[17:09:14] <grafi> what
[17:09:15] <grafi> oO
[17:09:19] <duch_kazatel> dwarder huh?
[17:09:49] <grafi> duch_kazatel i just looked at http://snapsvg.io/assets/images/background_2.svg and thought how it would be cool to create that effect with js
[17:10:06] <duch_kazatel> grafi ooh.
[17:10:06] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: whats up?
[17:10:10] <grafi> but it looks too scary to try it
[17:10:11] <grafi> :P
[17:10:23] <duch_kazatel> dwarder "how do i pass params to each other" do you know how to write basic functions?
[17:10:29] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to accomplish
[17:10:38] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: have you seen the jsfiddle?
[17:10:57] <duch_kazatel> yeah.  i see 4 functions and then you piping things around.
[17:11:04] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to accomplish?
[17:11:15] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: i need to pass data from one to another
[17:11:22] <duch_kazatel> then use callbacks?
[17:11:32] <duch_kazatel> on each function, call another, passing your data.
[17:11:55] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12274114/sequencing-function-calls-in-javascript-are-callbacks-the-only-way
[17:12:11] <grafi> well also queues
[17:12:13] <grafi> i guess
[17:12:22] <duch_kazatel> you're asking about promises.
[17:12:40] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: beside promises
[17:12:47] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: how do i pass another data
[17:12:51] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:13:01] <dwarder> and use it in another function
[17:13:07] <duch_kazatel> so you don't want to use promises or callbacks.
[17:13:09] <dwarder> with this pipe system
[17:13:19] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12274114/sequencing-function-calls-in-javascript-are-callbacks-the-only-way
[17:13:23] <duch_kazatel> dude I can read.

[17:14:40] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: then i want to use promises :) with params
[17:15:03] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: or should i just use global var?

[17:15:30] <Mrgoose> how can you select a class like this in jquery [class*="bar-"]
[17:15:41] <duch_kazatel> Mrgoose huh?
[17:16:07] <duch_kazatel> Mrgoose you're looking for everything with a class that starts with "bar-"?
[17:16:31] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[17:16:32] <Mrgoose> yes i have a css [class*="bar-"] {
[17:16:48] <duch_kazatel> ah
[17:17:00] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3204632/jquery-get-a-element-class-based-on-a-prefix
[17:17:14] <duch_kazatel> or use http://stackoverflow.com/questions/190253/jquery-selector-regular-expressions
[17:17:18] <duch_kazatel> that second one should help.
[17:17:53] <Mrgoose> thanks
[17:18:07] <duch_kazatel> just keep in mind you have to dl/setup a new filter.
[17:19:37] <blackmes1> Hi all. I want to add a class to my <li> elements if the content contains matches from an array. anyone has suggestion? http://jsfiddle.net/z4QpB/
[17:23:19] <duch_kazatel> blackmes1 what all have you tried?
[17:24:25] <duch_kazatel> blackmes1 because the solution might be easier than you think.
[17:24:30] <blackmes1> nothing yet ;/
[17:24:41] <duch_kazatel> blackmes1 what do you think you'd do?
[17:25:20] <blackmes1> use a selector like $('li span')
[17:25:28] <blackmes1> and read the content
[17:25:30] <duch_kazatel> and?
[17:26:00] <blackmes1> and check if it matches the array contents
[17:26:09] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle.net/z4QpB/1/
[17:26:13] <duch_kazatel> here's a hacky solution.
[17:26:56] <blackmes1> oh so quick. I can read that well
[17:28:16] <blackmes1> thx for your help duch_kazatel
[17:28:33] <duch_kazatel> do you understand what i'm doing there?
[17:32:32] <blackmes1> now yes. needed to look through it slowly
[17:33:00] <blackmes1> I always get confused if there are many 'this'
[17:33:43] <duch_kazatel> $(this) can become pretty easy.
[17:33:49] <duch_kazatel> you're basically in a current "context"
[17:35:02] <blackmes1> so context is li.url
[17:35:11] <duch_kazatel> err...
[17:35:13] <duch_kazatel> no.
[17:35:51] <duch_kazatel> err, yeah, sorry.
[17:35:55] <duch_kazatel> that class name was funky.
[17:36:15] <duch_kazatel> in that fiddle, $(this) inside the each() is a reference to the current li.url getting "worked" on.
[17:36:54] <duch_kazatel> so for each li.url, you iterate through your array, and check to see if the span text matches and, if so, set some CSS on it.
[17:37:19] <clime> do you know any jquery carousel that enables dynamically loading and removing images?
[17:37:33] <duch_kazatel> clime why would you do that? O.o
[17:37:44] <duch_kazatel> that sounds terribly inefficient.
[17:37:46] <blackmes1> duch_kazatel: thx for the explanation and your help!
[17:38:43] <clime> duch_kazatel: i want to initiallly load like 20 images into the carousel but there are, in theory, hundreds/thousands of images, i want to load another 20 if user scrolls to the last image from the last batch
[17:39:11] <pixelpimp> try googling with the term "infinite scroll"
[17:39:33] <duch_kazatel> Clime err, carousels are becoming less and less popular because they're not very user friendly.  if you really need something like that, you need to look at techniques similar to infinite scrolling.
[17:39:37] <duch_kazatel> and debouncing images.
[17:43:35] <clime> can I do infinite scrolling inside a container that is scrollable (no scrollbar, but arrows to move and mousewheel working)?
[17:43:51] <duch_kazatel> you'd apply similar techniques.
[17:44:18] <duch_kazatel> but again: http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[17:45:42] <clime> duch_kazatel: what do you mean "similar techniques"? How can I create an area on the page (div or something) that is scrolled independently of the main window?
[17:46:31] <duch_kazatel> seriously?  ajax.  call to the server and say "i need links for images x through y"
[17:46:41] <duch_kazatel> debounce images not in view.
[17:46:45] <duch_kazatel> load those up
[17:47:05] <duch_kazatel> after the user has gotten through a few, again - "I need links for images y+1 through z"
[17:47:05] <duch_kazatel> etc.
[17:47:23] <duch_kazatel> the issue is that carousels are generally a bad idea.
[17:48:49] <clime> duch_kazatel: that is nice but i am not asking about that, i know how to load additional images. I am more interested in how to create scrollable subarea on a page. Do I i need iframe or...?
[17:49:07] <duch_kazatel> ... you said you were going to use arrows.
[17:49:23] <clime> duch_kazatel: as well as mousewheel
[17:49:47] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow
[17:49:52] <duch_kazatel> overflow: scroll
[17:50:16] <duch_kazatel> you better be careful with the mousewheel.
[17:50:30] <duch_kazatel> users could click on your content area and wind up really bogging things down.\
[17:52:06] <clime> duch_kazatel: it is a vertical carousel on a side of a page. I don't think this is a "bad practice" case or anything.
[17:53:24] <clime> duch_kazatel: something like movie strip. I like it a lot in fact.  Anyway too late to change design.
[17:54:04] <clime> duch_kazatel: can I make something overflow: scroll and not show scrollbars at the same time?
[17:54:04] <duch_kazatel> "vertical movie strip" and "carousel" are 2 very different ideas.
[17:54:29] <duch_kazatel> clime you set overflow: hidden; and then reposition content as needed.
[17:54:42] <clime> duch_kazatel: well i guess but atm i am using jquery carousel plugin for it. It can be done simpler i believe as you suggest
[17:55:11] <duch_kazatel> you can use a carousel to do it I guess, just a strange idea.
[17:55:23] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: in my example, is it ok to add an object (d.myObjectParamsToNextPipeFunction ={};) here http://jsfiddle.net/zerkms/zJhph/
[17:55:36] <dwarder> to this var d = $.Deferred();
[17:55:55] <duch_kazatel> if you want a scrollable area, set it to overflow: scroll.  if you don't want scrollbars, use overflow: hidden.  you'll have to bake up a bunch of new logic, though.
[17:55:56] <clime> duch_kazatel: well i am not frontend programmer :( this was easiest. But now i am hitting some problems with the plugin i use (caroufredsel)
[17:56:10] <duch_kazatel> clime aaaaaaah
[17:57:20] <duch_kazatel> clime yeah you're going to have a hell of a time.
[17:58:30] <clime> duch_kazatel: xD cool.
[17:58:50] <blackmes1> duch_kazatel: does your function also work if the <li> content isnt exactly like from the array? http://jsfiddle.net/z4QpB/3/
[17:59:35] <duch_kazatel> black huh?
[17:59:49] <duch_kazatel> oh, no.
[17:59:54] <duch_kazatel> it needs to be an exact match.
[18:00:06] <duch_kazatel> did you want to number <li>'s?
[18:00:58] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: i read the article, i guess i need to test everything out before i start to understand this defered
[18:01:00] <duch_kazatel> automatically
[18:01:09] <duch_kazatel> dwarder yeah can't help you much man.
[18:01:36] <clime> duch_kazatel: i already have done the logic for infinite scrolling though. The only thing left is to make a scrollable subarea of the page. if I set overflow: hidden, it won't be scrollable right?
[18:01:53] <duch_kazatel> clime define "scrollable"
[18:02:10] <duch_kazatel> if you're fine with the built-in scroll controls, use overflow: scroll;
[18:02:22] <duch_kazatel> if you use overflow: hidden, you have to manually reposition the content of the div.
[18:02:24] <clime> duch_kazatel: ye well, not happy with themxD
[18:02:44] <clime> duch_kazatel: i see, so i need to listen for mousewheel events etc
[18:02:45] <duch_kazatel> why not?
[18:02:55] <duch_kazatel> why not just use plain old scroll?
[18:03:20] <clime> duch_kazatel: cause it would look very bad to have a classic system scrollbar next to that fancy movie strip
[18:03:46] <duch_kazatel> clime without seeing your design, you're basically saying "I don't want to use something users will easily recognize"
[18:03:48] <clime> and next to that another scrollbar for the main window
[18:04:03] <duch_kazatel> http://manos.malihu.gr/jquery-custom-content-scroller/
[18:04:07] <duch_kazatel> that's your next best bet
[18:04:36] <clime> duch_kazatel: well, there will be some arrows to but i want to support mousewheel as well.
[18:04:49] <duch_kazatel> blackmes1 did you just want to have each link numbered in the li?
[18:04:52] <duch_kazatel> err, UL.
[18:05:01] <duch_kazatel> clime dude read the page i linked.
[18:05:18] <clime> duch_kazatel: woot? I am just reading it
[18:05:28] <duch_kazatel> "Custom scrollbar plugin that’s fully customizable with CSS. Features vertical/horizontal scrolling, mouse-wheel support (via jQuery mousewheel plugin), scrolling buttons, scroll inertia with easing, auto-adjustable scrollbar length, nested scrollbars, scroll-to functionality, user defined callbacks and much more."
[18:06:01] <duch_kazatel> that will handle all your scrolling needs.
[18:06:04] <clime> duch_kazatel: wow, sounds nice
[18:06:07] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: well, you could modify this example http://jsfiddle.net/zerkms/zJhph/ by adding parram passing functionality to this code ;)
[18:06:24] <clime> duch_kazatel: you cool man
[18:06:36] <dwarder> that would help me understand a little bit more
[18:06:39] <duch_kazatel> dwarder dude "param passing functionality" means something very different than what you think it means.
[18:07:29] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: i want a var from one function be in another one
[18:07:37] <duch_kazatel> dwarder http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/wrangle-async-tasks-with-jquery-promises/
[18:07:49] <duch_kazatel> dwarder you need to learn about promise objects and deferred objects.
[18:08:09] <dwarder> thanx, reading ...
[18:08:18] <duch_kazatel> dwarder i don't understand why callbacks won't work in your particular use case.
[18:09:09] <blackmes1> duch_kazatel: Ive tried something like this $('li span').text().match(/url1.com/)
[18:09:19] <duch_kazatel> blackmes1 answer the question ;)
[18:09:53] <blackmes1> duch_kazatel: the numbers are already in there with a link
[18:10:08] <duch_kazatel> blackmes1 you can use css to add the numbers instead.
[18:10:34] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/z4QpB/4/
[18:11:21] <duch_kazatel> if you need to actually check, you can use indexOf() on strings.
[18:13:01] <blackmes1> nice. basically I want the <span>1. http://url1.com/bla/bla</span> to be checked against "url1.com"
[18:13:14] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/z4QpB/5/
[18:13:22] <duch_kazatel> indexOf
[18:13:32] <duch_kazatel> don't need a regex for that.
[18:16:23] <blackmes1> cool
[18:16:52] <duch_kazatel> what're you building?
[18:18:51] <blackmes1> I have a list of urls where I want highlight own urls
[18:18:57] <duch_kazatel> ...
[18:19:03] <duch_kazatel> for what greater purpose?
[18:19:05] <duch_kazatel> lol
[18:20:25] <blackmes1> mmmhh do I need to wrap your function into a document.ready? because on page load it doesnt add the class, only when I run the function from the browser console
[18:20:52] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[18:21:00] <duch_kazatel> if your javascript in in the page before the html.
[18:21:10] <duch_kazatel> or put the javascript at the end.
[18:24:38] <grafi> hm you would think that jquery can attach something to an svg element, wouldnt you?
[18:29:03] <clime> duch_kazatel: probably a stupid question but could you just explain to me a basic difference between carousel and that custom content scroll plugin? :)
[18:34:32] <clime> duch_kazatel: well i guess carousel is for cycling (most of the time) some discrete elements potentially with fancy transition effect and that scroller has just one transition - scrolling that can be non-discrete (because it does not work with individual elements), doesn't support rotating of its content
[18:35:32] <clime> I kinda get that but there are some differences. But basically that plugin is what I have been looking for last few days. Didn't know something that specific exists:)
[18:35:43] <clime> *differences and similarities
[18:36:55] <Yanith> Hello! everyone! i haven't used IRC since the 90's :D it's bringing back a lot of memories
[18:37:24] <petey_> welcome
[18:37:50] <pixelpimp> it's no longer the 90s? :(
[18:37:57] <petey_> im not sure if sublime has their own channel but anyone by chance know how inside "find" select the "only in selection" command
[18:38:01] <petey_> via keyboard rather than mouse
[18:38:37] <Yanith> hello petey, i know, i think last time i used an IRC client  ICQ was still cool so imagine lol
[18:39:08] <Yanith> i was a kid still,
[18:39:49] <Yanith> anyways,.. nice to see people still use the protocol.
[18:40:48] <Yanith> the reason i joined is cuz i'm working on a little animation but for some reason i can't remove one class, and i was wondering if someone could help me
[18:57:42] <jphase> unnu: my nigga
[19:26:18] <jtal> I have a bootstrap modal with a form on it; when I hit "enter" on the keyboard it closes the modal and tries to submit the form behind the modal even though modal form has the focus;  somehow, when add a ?something to the end of the URL, this bad behavior stops (in chrome only)
[19:26:31] <jtal> I know this isnt strictly jquery, but anyone know .... wtf?
[19:26:56] <Yanith> can someone take a look at this if statement http://jsfiddle.net/WWFjR/1/  when i add the if statement the code break :S
[19:28:15] <jtal> did you see the error?
[19:28:24] <jtal>  #assetQuery has no method 'has'
[19:28:33] <jtal> $?
[19:28:36] <Ububegin> I am passing a Json object from Java in this format ... {"a":["apple","aron","argentina"], "b":["Banana","Bran","Brazil"]} .. how do I iterate through all these values using Jquery/javascript
[19:29:08] <jtal> Yanith: $
[19:29:29] <samholmes> How can I get the element that submitted a form in the submit event?
[19:30:49] <Ububegin> I want to get all they keys also ....
[19:30:51] <jtal> samholmes its probably in the first param, the event
[19:31:24] <jtal> Ububegin: jquery's each() ?
[19:33:04] <jtal> Ububegin: sorry, thats to iterate over jquery objects ... I think just normal js for loop
[19:33:22] <jtal> like java's except "in" instead of ":"
[19:36:18] <Yanith> sorry jtal i didn't get it #assetQuery does have the has method
[19:38:15] <jtal> Yanith you are missing $
[19:38:17] <Ububegin> jtal: Doesnt each() only able to iterate for obj.a -> apple,aron,argentina right.. can it iterate a map like obj
[19:38:41] <jtal> Ububegin: ignore each() just us a normal js "for" loop
[20:01:47] <Validatorian> I'm writing a plugin that points an arrow to an element, but need to determine whether the entire arrow would be visible in the viewport, and if not, try another direction (left, right, up, and down are the possiblities) - I can't seem to find an example of this via google, and I'm not sure how to do those calculations -- any ideas?
[20:02:49] <Ububegin> jtal : http://jsfiddle.net/SqpSj/1/
[20:03:29] <Ububegin> Anyone else knows, what is wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/SqpSj/1/
[20:05:54] <raj> how do I get 'dragging' to register on this? http://jsfiddle.net/PCChD/
[20:06:44] <raj> Ububegin, what's wrong?
[20:07:00] <raj> Ububegin, that's not how you iterate in js
[20:07:30] <raj> or at least, that's not the preferred way, I don't believe
[20:08:00] <raj> Ububegin, take a look at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3010840/loop-through-array-in-javascript
[20:08:45] <raj> Validatorian, if you choose the cursor image, you have a predetermined size
[20:08:57] <raj> other than that, I don't know how to be exact
[20:21:03] <raj> grrrr, why's #jquery so dead last few days!
[20:21:34] <pixelpimp> my evil scheme is working
[20:21:40] <raj> apparently
[20:34:25] <raj> how do I get 'clicking' action to register on this? http://jsfiddle.net/PCChD/1/
[20:34:59] <shoky> raj: it's registering, no?
[20:35:14] <raj> AWESOME
[20:35:18] <raj> thank you god for shoky
[20:35:19] <raj> ok
[20:35:23] <shoky> lOl
[20:35:24] <raj> umm, register is the wrong word
[20:35:46] <raj> but the 'click' event is not executing
[20:35:49] <raj> or listening
[20:35:51] <raj> or something
[20:35:56] <shoky> i see "clicking" in the console
[20:36:02] <shoky> "dragging" too
[20:36:03] <raj> shoky, use /1/
[20:36:11] <raj> clicking only works with double clicks
[20:36:21] <shoky> i am.. the first one didnt work at all
[20:36:32] <shoky> nah working with single clicks for me
[20:37:11] <raj> what browser?
[20:37:17] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/PCChD/2/
[20:37:19] <shoky> chrome
[20:37:26] <shoky> just added  agray backgroun to that selection div
[20:37:56] <raj> the grey background shows up underneath the items
[20:38:03] <shoky> yep
[20:38:11] <raj> cuz it's not absolute, but I guess that doesn't matter
[20:38:17] <raj> anyway, i still only see "dragging"
[20:38:35] <shoky> lots of clicking for me
[20:39:57] <raj> hmm,
[20:40:01] <raj> not for me in chrome
[20:40:04] <raj> but does work in IE
[20:40:13] <d3m0n> Would someone mind helping me with animating a background position on the Y axis? http://jsfiddle.net/xbRyz/6/
[20:44:13] <raj> shoky, no go, even with all extensions disabled
[20:44:15] <raj> i'm very confused
[20:44:33] <raj> only double clicks show up with "clicking"
[20:46:21] <raj> can someone else confirm that they get clicks, please
[20:46:26] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/PCChD/2/
[20:49:09] <d3m0n> get clicks?
[20:49:23] <raj> if you click the green thing, do you get "clicking" in the console?
[20:49:42] <raj> from a single click on the green "This is an item"
[20:49:49] <raj> or does it say "dragging"?
[20:50:10] <pixelpimp> i get clicking
[20:50:13] <d3m0n> I get click
[20:50:18] <raj> windows/mac?
[20:50:20] <raj> browser?
[20:50:24] <shoky> win
[20:50:25] <d3m0n> Windows/FF
[20:50:37] <raj> oh, I thought you were on a mac for some reason shoky
[20:50:42] <shoky> nopez
[20:50:48] <jphase> what are we clicking?
[20:50:55] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/PCChD/2/
[20:51:08] <raj> single click on "This is an item" and see what the console says
[20:52:15] <jphase> "clicking" in mac/chrome/ff/safari
[20:52:37] <raj> wtf
[20:52:42] <raj> I don't see how this is happening
[20:54:08] <card> Hey... any ideas why .selectable() is preventing default action for clicking li elements? Seems like this should work: http://jsfiddle.net/RKxj7/15/
[20:54:27] <jphase> what's happening raj? (sorry just got here)
[20:55:03] <raj> I see "dragging", everyone else is seeing "clicking"
[20:55:29] <jphase> well, I see dragging when I drag, not when I click
[20:55:39] <raj> when you click, you see click?
[20:55:42] <jphase> yeah
[20:55:48] <raj> I only get click when I double click
[20:55:53] <raj> ok, very weird
[20:55:54] <jphase> :\
[20:56:02] <shoky> raj do you get clicks in a blank jsfiddle
[20:56:06] <shoky> with a button or whatever
[20:57:52] <raj> shoky, yes
[20:58:01] <raj> I even get clicks if I remove drag stuff in my fiddle
[20:58:22] <jphase> o_O
[20:59:13] <jphase> and you're 100% not moving your mouse when clicking? is your mouse at like... FPS gamer speed by chance?
[20:59:18] <raj> yes
[20:59:23] <raj> no
[20:59:39] <jphase> odd indeed
[21:00:00] <raj> shoky, could I buy you a coffee to tv with me?
[21:00:11] <shoky> lol,wat?
[21:00:18] <raj> tv = teamviewer
[21:00:22] <shoky> ohh
[21:00:29] <raj> thought that was common jargon by onw
[21:00:31] <raj> :)
[21:00:32] <shoky> ill take a look, sure
[21:00:33] <raj> *now
[21:00:46] <shoky> but jus t a short one, goin to bed
[21:00:55] <raj> sure thing
[21:00:56] <shoky> 7am ;s
[21:01:06] <raj> lol, you're such an early bird
[21:01:10] <shoky> ;]
[21:01:19] <shoky> do i need to install a client?
[21:01:44] <raj> you don't need to install, you can just run it
[21:02:29] <shoky> hm?
[21:02:44] <shoky> o you mean i still need to download it
[21:06:58] <greglaptop> Hi, I have a jquery on function in a page that is not firing. I have the jquery min include above the script... what am I doing wrong.... I can alsopaste code....
[21:07:18] <anthonym> checked the debugger?
[21:08:02] <greglaptop> yeah doesnt execute i dont see any errors
[21:08:53] <card> Any idea why .selectable() is preventing the click handler in this example?: http://jsfiddle.net/RKxj7/15/
[21:53:17] <xinming> Hi, $('.class')   <--- What does this returned
[21:53:20] <xinming> I know how to use it
[21:53:48] <LeBlaaanc> An object?
[21:54:07] <xinming> I mean, $('.class').blabla   the blabla can be many methods, But now I want to know what the name of the object it is returned?
[21:54:10] <pixelpimp> a jquery object
[21:54:23] <pixelpimp> what do you mean by 'name?'
[21:54:34] <xinming> So, If I want to save $('.class') in to a var name, I just use  var jq_obj = $('.class')?
[21:54:42] <LeBlaaanc> yes
[21:54:51] <xinming> pixelpimp: I wish to save the result of $('.class')
[21:55:09] <LeBlaaanc> xinming: defacto is $myvar
[21:55:16] <xinming> but I don't know the exact name of the returned thing of $('.class');
[21:55:31] <LeBlaaanc> it
[21:55:51] <xinming> for example, $('.class')[0] is named dom node. :-)
[21:56:03] <xinming> I use var node = $('.class')[0];
[21:56:10] <LeBlaaanc> er.. it's an instance of the jquery class in theory… so defacto standard is var $boobies = $('.boobies');
[21:56:32] <xinming> but I don't know what to use var ??? = $('.class')[0];
[21:56:35] <xinming> but I don't know what to use var ??? = $('.class');
[21:56:43] <xinming> Ok, Thanks, I'll choose $var
[21:56:50] <LeBlaaanc> use … var $boobies and var boobies
[21:56:57] <LeBlaaanc> to differentiate
[21:57:06] <xinming> Ok, thanks
[21:57:16] <LeBlaaanc> irrespectively hah
[21:57:50] <jphase> actually... he literally means you need to name them boobies every time or it doesn't work :o
[21:58:27] <LeBlaaanc> huh?
[21:58:38] <jphase> bit of sarcasm
[21:58:55] <jphase> doesn't always translate via ascii charset I suppose
[21:59:01] <LeBlaaanc> heh
[21:59:12] * LeBlaaanc just got it.
[21:59:21] * jphase highfives
[21:59:35] <LeBlaaanc> anyone know what $(document).height() gives some weird number?
[21:59:45] <LeBlaaanc> er I mean $(window).height();
[21:59:50] <LeBlaaanc> I'd expect it to be the viewport height?
[21:59:57] <jphase> it's just the calculated height of the window yeah
[22:00:14] <jphase> (defaults to px units without "px" and string type)
[22:00:24] <LeBlaaanc> I'm not getting that
[22:00:33] <jphase> oh? what you has in console?
[22:01:06] <LeBlaaanc> http://screencast.com/t/ka3jtZP9z << definitely not 1743px
[22:01:08] <chim3ra> Hey guys, I was hoping someone could assist please. Im pretty new to jQuery and need some help
[22:01:37] <jphase> LeBlaaanc: sure, that's just the calculated height in px of your window as an integer
[22:01:46] <chim3ra> Ive got a hover function bound to an image as such : $( "#image" ).hover(function(){showPreview('image.jpg')},function(){fadeOutPreview()});
[22:01:47] <LeBlaaanc> oh not the viewport?
[22:02:07] <LeBlaaanc> viewport should be like ~200px
[22:02:26] <jphase> LeBlaaanc: well I believe that's the rendered height of the window in px as type integer actually, but someone may correct me here shortly
[22:02:33] <chim3ra> my functions are getting called but if my animation has not finished the mouseout function of the hover is never called
[22:02:46] <chim3ra> can someone please shed some light if possible...
[22:03:37] <jphase> chim3ra: you have any ajax or asynchronous stuff going on in those functions?
[22:03:51] <LeBlaaanc> chim3ra: maybe use the callback of the mouseout?
[22:04:35] <LeBlaaanc> jphase: how about this… any idea how to get if an item has "hit" the bottom of the viewport?
[22:05:25] <jphase> LeBlaaanc: yeah, you need to check the scroll position of the window and calculate the bottom of the element based on scrollTop of that element and it's rendered height
[22:05:36] <chim3ra> jphase: Not to my knowledge but i dont really know what all the functions are calling beneath the scenes
[22:06:06] <LeBlaaanc> jphase: okay but I'd have to add the viewport height to scrolltop would I not?
[22:06:44] <jphase> chim3ra: well the way you wrote that function, the callback on hover out *should* work, but with asynchronous events like ajax calls you may need to look into using a deferred pipe
[22:07:02] <jphase> sometimes things happen before things are "done"
[22:08:02] <LeBlaaanc> actually hang on… I'd need the the $element."x"position + $element.height()… and it that is > $(document).scrollTop + $viewport.height() ...
[22:08:22] <chim3ra> This is the function that is not getting stopped early:
[22:08:23] <chim3ra> function showPreview(image) {
[22:08:25] <jphase> LeBlaaanc: you'd bind to the scroll event of the window and run some calculations based on the height of your element, the height of the window, etc., and do math to find when the bottom of the element is at the bottom of the viewport based on the window's scrollTop
[22:08:25] <chim3ra> 	$(this).stop();   	 $( "#textforanim" ).stop( true, true ).hide(); 	 $( "#anim" ).stop( true, true ).fadeOut( "slow", function() { document.getElementById("wrapper").innerHTML = "Setting some HTML stuff in here" 	$( "#textforanim" ).stop( true, true ).effect( "slide", "slow");
[22:08:26] <chim3ra> });	
[22:08:48] <jphase> chim3ra: for larger bits of code try using a pastebin of sorts in the future ;]
[22:08:57] <chim3ra> sorry buddy
[22:09:02] <jphase> all good
[22:09:13] <LeBlaaanc> jphase: does that sound right the "x" position of the element? can I get such a thing?
[22:09:27] <LeBlaaanc> or is that going to be relative to the viewport :|
[22:09:40] <jphase> LeBlaaanc: oh, yeah, you'd need scrollLeft for that though
[22:10:03] <jphase> chim3ra: no async events in that function, so shouldn't be an issue there
[22:10:38] <LeBlaaanc> sorry maybe I meant "y" position
[22:11:00] <LeBlaaanc> let me experiment for a second brb
[22:14:49] <LeBlaaanc> okay so I get the bottom of the object via $('…').offset().top + $('…').height(); but now how do I get the x position of the bottom of the viewport?
[22:15:20] <LeBlaaanc> (including the scrolled amount)
[22:15:47] <jphase> LeBlaaanc: x is horizontal, you mean y?
[22:15:59] <LeBlaaanc> ya
[22:16:00] <LeBlaaanc> sorry
[22:16:07] <LeBlaaanc> $(window).scrollTop() + height() of viewport
[22:16:20] <LeBlaaanc> or some other metod
[22:16:40] <jphase> LeBlaaanc: something like $('#mydiv').position().top + $('#mydiv').height()
[22:16:53] <jphase> I think the second part of that might need to be adjust for padding and such though
[22:17:03] <jphase> I always have to console.log each time I do this to be sure :\
[22:17:32] <jphase> but .position is the thing you need here
[22:17:46] <LeBlaaanc> .offset() worked too, the values seemed to be the same
[22:17:59] <jphase> ahh yeah, that sounds familiar :x
[22:18:11] <LeBlaaanc> but again I'm not hung up on that
[22:18:37] <LeBlaaanc> I dunno how to get the x position of the bottom of the viewport including the scrollTop
[22:19:36] <jphase> the scrollTop + the height should do it
[22:19:47] <jphase> top + height of anything = bottom
[22:20:00] <jphase> considering random padding and offset situations of course
[22:20:11] <LeBlaaanc> uh?
[22:20:32] <jphase> the position of any element + the height of that element = the bottom of that element
[22:20:44] <jphase> position meaning top position*
[22:20:52] <LeBlaaanc> well again sure… but how do I get the current bottom of the viewport
[22:21:09] <jphase> the height of the window = the bottom
[22:21:26] <LeBlaaanc> $(window).height() seems to return the same as $(document).height()
[22:21:52] <LeBlaaanc> which is not accurate either way. it's 1700 when it should be like 700
[22:22:02] <LeBlaaanc> 1700 is the entire document height
[22:24:38] <grafi> PARTY HARD
[22:26:29] <LeBlaaanc> dammit why does the hottest sex scene in game of thrones have to be ruined by leeches
[22:26:59] <grafi> so you like the witch?
[22:27:13] <LeBlaaanc> ya she's mega hot
[22:27:17] <grafi> didnt you see her offspring?
[22:27:18] <grafi> :P
[22:27:50] <LeBlaaanc> guess I don't remember that part haha
[22:29:26] <LeBlaaanc> grafi: any thoughts on this whole viewport bottom thing?
[22:30:03] <grafi> let me refresh your memory http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejh864hY5_g&t=4m3s
[22:30:05] <grafi> :P
[22:30:17] <grafi> viewwhat? didnt follow
[22:31:52] <d3m0n> Hey guys, still having trouble trying to figure out how to animate backgroind position of the Y axis, any suggestions? - http://jsfiddle.net/xbRyz/6/
[22:32:08] <sasmit87> hi I am using jquery validator for  validation. I have a form where some blocks are dynamically generated on click of add more button..I need to validate all those which blocks are display block
[22:34:25] <LeBlaaanc> grafi trying to figure out how to get the "y" position of the bottom of the viewport.
[22:35:01] <grafi> y
[22:35:03] <grafi> hahah
[22:35:06] <grafi> bad joke
[22:35:08] <grafi> im sorry
[22:35:08] <grafi> :P
[22:35:25] <LeBlaaanc> well, to figure out if the bottom of some other element hits it
[22:35:54] <grafi> and whats the bigger picture?
[22:36:03] <LeBlaaanc> infinite scroll
[22:36:08] <LeBlaaanc> after an element
[22:37:15] <grafi> so like find out when to start loading new stuff
[22:37:21] <LeBlaaanc> yes.
[22:37:38] <LeBlaaanc> but it's not the browser button it's the bottom of some element.
[22:37:43] <LeBlaaanc> bottom*
[22:38:25] <grafi> first of all why not use http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/
[22:38:35] <grafi> or at least source into the lookcode
[22:38:44] <grafi> to see how its working
[22:38:45] <grafi> :P
[22:38:50] <sasmit87> hi I am using jquery validator for validation. I have a form where some blocks are dynamically generated on click of add more button..I need to validate all those which blocks are display block
[22:39:00] <sasmit87> http://dev.freshersworld.com/user/qualification
[22:39:24] <d3m0n> I honestly don't think that would be possible because it requires user interaction?
[22:40:06] <sasmit87> what??
[22:40:09] <LeBlaaanc> grafi: ah thanks.. this'll work I just didn't know such a thing existed.
[22:40:17] <grafi> :)
[22:40:34] <grafi> and second of all why is $(document).height() not working for you?
[22:40:53] <grafi> shouldnt that be the thing that tells you how long the page is
[22:41:48] <grafi> d3m0n whats wrong with the working thingie in the fiddle, that not good?
[22:42:09] <d3m0n> It doesn't work >.<
[22:42:20] <grafi> but it moves
[22:42:26] <d3m0n> On the X axis
[22:42:32] <d3m0n> Iam trying to get the Y axis to animate
[22:46:16] <d3m0n> a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma
[22:51:40] <d3m0n> I didnt realize it would be this hard to figure out something that seems so simple
[22:51:53] <d3m0n> Googling doesn't produce any satisfying answers
[22:52:18] <d3m0n> Most suggesting background-position-x which doesnt have much support
[23:22:14] <MightyFlyer> Hi,would anyone have hint on how to load a JSON file that doesn't start with { but with "something: {" ? Would that beJSONP?
[23:23:38] <sasmit87> hey anybody used jquery validator
[23:23:39] <sasmit87> ?
[23:24:43] <Cork> MightyFlyer: no that is nether json or jsonp
[23:25:09] <Cork> MightyFlyer: you would have to load it as string and do a normal string parsing of it
[23:25:49] <Cork> MightyFlyer: you could try fixing it by adding the missing {} to the string and see if a json parser can handle it then
[23:25:53] <MightyFlyer> Uh well it would be valid json if i just added another {} around it. Guess i'll have to have some wrapper for it. Thanks. :)
[23:26:44] <Cork> MightyFlyer: ya, though if the {} is missing it sounds like it just happens to look like json, and most likely is something else
[23:28:10] <MightyFlyer> It's a mixed feed from a webservice with a file "rss.json". Well they migth be doing strange this. Guess I'll have to dig around and make sure it's valid. Thanks for pointing it out!
[23:29:11] <Cork> MightyFlyer: well check the content-type header instead of the url extension
[23:31:18] <MightyFlyer> The content type would be correct: Content-Type:	application/json; charset=utf-8
[23:31:41] <Cork> MightyFlyer: so then the server is broken
[23:32:11] <Cork> might be they are generating the json by hand instead of through a json lib and just miss part of it
[23:32:47] <MightyFlyer> Looks like it. I just used JSONLint to check the JSON and well basically they're missing a bunch of "'s it seems.
[23:33:41] <HD|Laptop> Hi
[23:33:48] <MightyFlyer> Thanks for the help. I guess i'll get into contact with the service provider or write a wrapper to fix it.
[23:34:03] <HD|Laptop> can someone please look into Trac?
[23:34:09] <HD|Laptop> Submitting a bug is PAINFULLY slow.
[23:34:15] <MightyFlyer> But for now i'm logging off. Have a nice day!
[23:34:28] <HD|Laptop> Took 45sec to load the submission for http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14481
[23:34:42] <HD|Laptop> (also, if someone could have a look at the bug, too, that would be nice!)
[23:34:42] <Cork> HD|Laptop: i don't think there is any server admins here
[23:34:57] <HD|Laptop> Cork: you know where one may be able to reach them?
[23:35:12] <Cork> mail i would guess, but no
[23:35:33] <HD|Laptop> .oO( file a bug in a bug tracker about the broken bug tracker )
[23:36:11] <Cork> HD|Laptop: btw are you talking about submitting comments or loading the page?
[23:36:25] <Cork> cause it does load fast here
[23:37:11] <HD|Laptop> I'm talking about submitting a bug, the rest is fast here, too
[23:37:32] <Cork> ok
[23:37:52] <HD|Laptop> also, took me four attempts at that stupid captcha, submitting the bug took more time than single-stepping through the jQuery code -.-
[23:39:35] <Cork> HD|Laptop: might be worth checking the forums
[23:39:55] <HD|Laptop> Cork: btw, do you maybe have an idea how to workaround that nasty bug *without* having to rename that property?
[23:40:57] <Cork> HD|Laptop: that bug sounds invalid
[23:41:03] <Cork> length is magical in js
[23:41:16] <Cork> if you add length to an object you get an array like object
[23:41:32] <Cork> so it isn't jquery doing anything special it is how js works
[23:42:12] <Cork> js> var a = {0:'a', 1:'b', length:2}; print(JSON.stringify(a));
[23:42:17] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[23:42:30] <Cork> js> var a = {'0':'a', '1':'b', length:2}; print(JSON.stringify(a));
[23:42:36] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[23:42:38] <Cork> ...
[23:42:40] <HD|Laptop> js> var a={foo:"bar",length:2}; JSON.stringify(a);
[23:42:45] <b-ot> HD|Laptop: No output.
[23:42:58] <HD|Laptop> js> var a={foo:"bar",length:2};
[23:43:01] <b-ot> HD|Laptop: No output.
[23:43:40] <Cork> HD|Laptop: anyway if you set length on an array to 0 it will remove all the content in the array
[23:43:51] <sasmit87> Hi all...anybody over here used jquey validator plugin ?? I need a help on that
[23:44:02] <Cork> simplest is to either use length or wrap it in an array so jquery gets the array it expects
[23:44:05] <HD|Laptop> Cork: yep, that is why the bug occurs - trigger() converts the object into an array -.-
[23:44:11] <Cork> [{foo:"bar",length:2}]
[23:44:15] <Cork> would fix the problem you have
[23:44:21] <HD|Laptop> hmm, yeah
[23:44:53] <HD|Laptop> Cork: btw, if you run that code from above in chrome's JS console, it works just fine
[23:45:21] <Cork> HD|Laptop: ya it's cause it is going directly through the json stringifyer
[23:47:46] <Cork> HD|Laptop: can't get the example i remember working right now, but i know you can make an array through just adding length to an object
[23:48:07] <HD|Laptop> Cork: ok oO
[23:48:24] <HD|Laptop> interestingly, that with length being magical is not in the JSON spec
[23:49:05] <Cork> well we are talking about js not json
[23:49:55] <HD|Laptop> sure. but the fact that one could not get the expected result out of a JSON representation is...strange
[23:50:27] <HD|Laptop> especially as JSON should be a subset of javascript, so whatever's legal in JSON should also be legal in JS
[23:51:33] <Cork> HD|Laptop: no
[23:51:54] <Cork> HD|Laptop: json is a subset with lots of the quirks of js removed
[23:52:18] <Cork> length on an object is legal in js, it will just have unexpected effects of adding it
[23:52:35] <HD|Laptop> let me guess, the length-issue is one of these quirks?
[23:52:52] <Cork> scripts seeing the object as an array is ywa
[23:52:54] <Cork> *yes
