[00:13:09] <jak2000> hi
[00:13:14] <jak2000> robertmaxrees!!!
[00:13:16] <jak2000> helpppppppp
[00:18:42] <d2k> Good morning, good night wherever you are. I have a rather simple question for those that been using moments.js. I would like to translate the output, I have this snippet and need spanish output: http://pastebin.com/zey0Ftif
[00:20:32] <d2k> It also would be really perfect if I could but a break the string after date so hour shows in a second row or as a second div.
[00:33:29] <jak2017> ?
[00:40:27] <jak2017> d2k?
[00:45:39] <d2k> jak2017: Yes
[00:47:44] <jak2000> can?
[00:47:51] <d2k> jak2000: Hi
[00:47:57] <jak2000> d2k
[00:48:03] <jak2000> see the messages?
[00:48:09] <d2k> jak2000: yes
[00:48:22] <jak2000> pls go: http://markcell.github.io/jquery-tabledit/#examples example #2   see Jquery code...
[00:48:23] <jak2000> ok
[00:49:04] <jak2000> in the TABLE you can edit a row
[00:49:17] <jak2000> 2 clicks and in color column you can
[00:49:21] <jak2000> choose:
[00:49:22] <jak2000> editable: [[1, 'car'], [2, 'color', '{"1": "Red", "2": "Green", "3": "Blue"}']]
[00:49:27] <jak2000> Red Green or Blue
[00:49:28] <jak2000> right?
[00:50:41] <d2k> jak2000: yes
[00:53:35] <jak2000> my question is how to fill this array: '{"1": "Red", "2": "Green", "3": "Blue"}'  from a database?
[00:53:37] <jak2000> table
[00:55:55] <d2k> jak2000: I understand the question. I'm trying to find a snippet
[00:56:58] <jak2000> here my fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/55j0jodn/
[00:57:08] <jak2000> but in this case is static the array
[00:58:25] <d2k> jak2000: AFAIK you can put the script inside a php and then replace the values with a php echo
[00:58:38] <d2k> jak2000: might not be the cleanest solution
[00:59:42] <jak2000> i understand
[01:00:17] <jak2000> :(
[01:00:39] <WhirledPress> jak2000, if you are going to extend jquery, you need to account for the possiblity that multiple tables are passed to the method
[01:02:04] <jak2000> how to declare an array: var myArray[]='{"1":"Red", "2":"Blue", "3":"Black"}';   not work
[01:02:26] <WhirledPress> an array and and object are two different things.
[01:03:07] <WhirledPress> var myArray=[[1,"red"],[2,"blue"],[3,"black"]];
[01:03:25] <jak2000> ooo
[01:03:37] <WhirledPress> that gives you an array of 3 items...which are arrays of 2 items
[01:03:49] <d2k> jak2000: I once made something like this, it's working but I'm not sure if it is good for a editable table. Anyways it's not clean, it's very dirty but it might work: $('.maincontent').prepend("<h2 class=\"top-productname\">\<?php echo $heading_title; ?></h2>");		
[01:03:58] <jak2000> not like
[01:04:21] <WhirledPress> but chances are you just want ["red","blue","black"]
[01:04:34] <d2k> jak2000: so there I got a php echo. But I think you should listen to WhirledPress :)
[01:05:04] <jak2000> not: ["red","blue","black"]
[01:05:10] <jak2000> not var myArray=[[1,"red"],[2,"blue"],[3,"black"]];
[01:05:23] <jak2000> worked with this: var myArray='{"1":"Red", "2":"Blue", "3":"Black"}';
[01:05:27] <jak2000> simple stirng declaration
[01:05:47] <WhirledPress> you are asking for a string?
[01:06:06] <jak2000> i ask about: editable: [[1, 'car'], [2, 'color', '{"1": "Red", "2": "Green", "3": "Blue"}']]
[01:06:13] <jak2000> make the colors dinamically
[01:06:27] <d2k> jak2000: from strings?
[01:07:35] <WhirledPress> jak2000, what is your end goal? what does the table look like that you want in the end?
[01:08:20] <jak2000> WhirledPress: http://markcell.github.io/jquery-tabledit/#examples
[01:08:24] <jak2000> check 2d example
[01:08:47] <jak2000> the color column have 3 colors right? i want extract this values from a database table
[01:08:51] <jak2000> is my goal
[01:09:05] <d2k> Instead of "Red" I would write "<?php echo $color_red; ?>" but better not listen to me ;)
[01:09:41] <jak2000> yes something
[01:09:44] <jak2000> i think in this:
[01:10:14] <jak2000> editable: [[1, 'car'], [2, 'color', myArrayColors]]
[01:10:30] <jak2000> and on document ready.... i fill the myArrayColors..
[01:10:31] <jak2000> testing
[01:11:43] <WhirledPress> so you are looking to stringify your select options...
[01:11:54] <d2k> jak2000: That sounds like you need a basic array in javascript and some modification to the structure of your code.
[01:11:59] <jak2000> yes
[01:11:59] <WhirledPress> how does the data show up originally
[01:12:17] <jak2000> the data is stored in a mysql table
[01:12:42] <WhirledPress> so when you ajax the data from your table, what does it look like. Show me how the raw data appears
[01:14:17] <jak2000> ok wait pls
[01:19:14] <jak2000> json = Object {xAUmed: "{"1":"PIEZA","2":"BULTO","3":"KILOGRAMOS","4":"LITROS","5":"ROLLO",}"}
[01:21:47] <WhirledPress> columns:{identifier: [[0,"id"],editable:[1,"units"],[2,json]];
[01:28:08] <jak2000> done
[01:28:09] <jak2000> thanks
[01:30:47] <WhirledPress> I couldn't get it to work correctly with the fiddle you provided.
[01:44:03] <WhirledPress> can you check to see if something is a jquery object by if ($().is(obj)) {
[01:55:20] <Cork> WhirledPress: you can do obj instanceof jQuery
[01:55:33] <Cork> will return true if it is
[01:55:39] <WhirledPress> I always forget instanceof...thanks
[01:56:00] <Cork> another option is obj.constructor.name == "jQuery"
[02:09:29] <MACscr> Any idea why when i try to append  'pub' to the textarea? http://jsfiddle.net/w0tLy4rd/23/
[02:09:45] <MACscr> it wipes out the column instead?
[02:20:13] <MACscr> nevermind, got it working
[02:23:51] <Cork> MACscr: ah, sorry didn't get time to answer
[02:24:01] <MACscr> no worries at all.
[02:24:02] <Cork> MACscr: textarea is a replaced element, you don't append to it
[02:24:14] <Cork> you use the .val() and set the full new value to the element
[02:24:25] <MACscr> yep, thats what i figured out
[02:26:09] <MACscr> Cork well im a bit farther with my little editor ive been working on the past day or so http://jsfiddle.net/w0tLy4rd/24/
[02:26:52] <MACscr> im hoping i can find a plugin that will do both syntax highlighting (plenty of those) and actually proper beautifying (formatting) of the markup
[02:27:02] <MACscr> so the code easier to read
[02:27:09] <MACscr> havent found anything that does both
[02:41:29] <MACscr> Cork i also have to figure out how to delete currently selected elements as well. Lets say i add a button and then realize i dont need it or later dont need it. i need to be able to select and remove it. Not sure the best way to go about that.
[02:43:40] <MACscr> i know how to do remove(), but not sure how to keep an element as selected so when i click on the delete button, that selected element is referenced
[02:44:13] <Cork> there are plenty of ways to do that
[02:44:25] <suexec> Is this a valid selector: $("#mydiv.myClass") if I want to select a <span class='myClass'> contained within <div id="mydiv"> .. ?
[02:44:34] <Cork> you could store the last "selected" element in a global variable
[02:44:43] <Cork> you could have a delete button on each element (ex. a small x)
[02:44:46] <WhirledPress> capture the click event on the parent container and use the event to determine the target. Add a class to the current target and remove it from all the others.
[02:44:52] <Cork> you could use context menu and provide a delete option there
[02:44:54] <Cork> and so on
[02:45:15] <Cork> suexec: the selector is valid, but won't select what you want
[02:45:29] <Cork> suexec: you need a space between the class and the id
[02:45:43] <suexec> Cork, cheers
[02:46:14] <Cork> suexec: what you select in the original selector would match <div id="mydiv" class="myClass"></div>
[02:50:03] <suexec> Cork, makes sense :)I Thank you very much
[03:01:37] <MACscr> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/w0tLy4rd/25/ . How do I get line 47 of js to work with new elements that are added by the button as well?
[03:02:16] <Cork> MACscr: use delegation instead of binding it directly on the element
[03:02:52] <suexec> Cork, do you know if jQuery struggles with element id's containing colons?
[03:03:02] <Cork> nope
[03:03:10] <Cork> meaning it doesn't
[03:03:20] <Cork> but you will have to escape weird characters you put into ids
[03:03:39] <Cork> $('#the\\\\:id')
[03:03:55] <Cork> opps
[03:03:58] <WhirledPress> MACscr, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/w0tLy4rd/26/
[03:03:59] <Cork> one set too many
[03:04:01] <Cork> $('#the\\:id')
[03:04:28] <suexec> Is there an escape function that will do it for me? The id is fetched
[03:04:35] <Cork> no
[03:04:40] <suexec> alright
[03:04:48] <Cork> it is just like what you you have to do if you do this in css
[03:05:05] <Cork> characters that have a meaning in css needs to be escaped
[03:05:30] <Cork> *meaning in css selectors needs*
[03:05:50] <Cork> the difference is it needs to be double escaped as js strings will remove one level of escape
[03:06:02] <Cork> #the\:id <--
[03:06:09] <Cork> '#the\\:id' <-- js string
[03:09:59] <MACscr> WhirledPress thanks, but thats just more css i have to remove and keep track of before it goes to the html editor and then add it back. hmm. It does seem like a decent solution though
[03:10:33] <MACscr> maybe there is a better way to filter the html that goes to the editor when i click on Update HTML
[03:10:57] <MACscr> Id really like the code on the right to reflect whats on the left and vice versa
[03:11:24] <MACscr> that way little things like button placeholders and text size can be adjusted in the code editor
[03:11:55] <MACscr> i feel like my current update_html() function is a hack
[03:12:09] <WhirledPress> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/w0tLy4rd/27/
[03:12:45] <WhirledPress> when you add one, it gets a green line around it. Click on another one and it gets the green line. Delete works now
[03:13:38] <MACscr> WhirledPress yes, but you will see that when I click on update html, it shows that current class on the selected element
[03:13:46] <MACscr> and that would be incorrect
[03:13:47] <WhirledPress> The problem with how you were doing it before is that you were calling draggable on the parent element and then wrapping your stage in pub_elements.
[03:15:04] <WhirledPress> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/w0tLy4rd/29/
[03:15:28] <WhirledPress> just remove the current class before updating html
[03:15:52] <WhirledPress> you probably want to remove the "append to here" message as well
[03:16:13] <MACscr> eh, thats just test code
[03:17:03] <MACscr> why are you setting current on start of the draggable and resizable? I mean, it should already be selected when clicked on
[03:17:25] <WhirledPress> and you probably want to clone your stage element and work from a clone so you don't destroy the stage
[03:17:47] <WhirledPress> draggable and resizable capture the click event, so it doesn't always register
[03:19:14] <MACscr> im not sure what you mean by cloning my stage. Why do you think this is needed? what would destroy it?
[03:23:25] <WhirledPress> every time you call $.draggable() it ends up being costly. You do it for every element every time any element is added.
[03:23:55] <WhirledPress> I pass the newly created element to the makeModiable() function to call it once.
[03:24:23] <WhirledPress> Then, when you update your html. you should be able to create a clone of the stage, without having to destroy and re-draggable every element
[03:26:14] <MACscr> ah, i think I am following you. I am not 100% sure how to accomplish such a clone that still allows the removal of the unwanted classes in the textarea
[03:26:57] <MACscr> plus im going to need to at some point, have the editor prepopulated with lets say a saved record from db
[03:28:32] <WhirledPress> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/w0tLy4rd/29/
[03:28:44] <WhirledPress> removes all the classes starting with ui-
[03:30:19] <MACscr> WhirledPress i dont think you saved it
[03:30:24] <MACscr> =P
[03:30:42] <MACscr> btw, thanks so much for your detailed help. I sincerely appreciate it
[03:32:54] <MrGate> Hey maybe someone can help me figure out how to edit my array
[03:32:54] <MrGate> http://pastebin.com/5d6BXpC0
[03:33:05] <MrGate> im new to javascript/jquery
[03:36:22] <MACscr> MrGate throw it in jsfiddle
[03:37:07] <WhirledPress> MACscr, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/w0tLy4rd/34/
[03:42:12] <WhirledPress> MrGate, can you use object notation instead of array notation?
[03:42:28] <MrGate> https://jsfiddle.net/d2y4h6qf/
[03:43:25] <MrGate> WhirledPress: even with object notation i would still have to figure out how to edit the correct one by key
[03:43:32] <MrGate> if you get what i mean
[03:46:10] <WhirledPress> Not sure whjat you mean by "key"
[03:46:48] <MrGate> in an array their numbered like 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 .... etc right?
[03:47:04] <WhirledPress> sure. so just store that info in your object
[03:47:34] <MrGate> i am but trying to figure out how to access the object by that number and edit the contents in it
[03:52:37] <IamTrying> http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/#firstPage - Is there anyone ever made any site like this in jQuery. Is there some samples?
[03:53:32] <WhirledPress> MrGate, https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/d2y4h6qf/1/
[03:53:35] <WhirledPress> like that?
[03:54:25] <WhirledPress> https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/d2y4h6qf/2/   shows how to edit
[03:55:58] <MrGate> WhirledPress: not exactly, each time i push to FormObject, each thing needs to be its own object inside of FormObject
[03:56:29] <MrGate> and im trying to figure out how to edit a specific object inside of FormObject if i know its index/key
[03:56:59] <WhirledPress> IamTrying, that page is made in JQuery...fullPage.js extends jquery.
[03:57:12] <MrGate> i got a idea though because of that, i could do something like   FormObject[1].input_type = "new_text";
[03:57:30] <WhirledPress> Did you see the second link I provided. It's exactly that
[03:59:00] <MrGate> haha no :)
[03:59:37] <MACscr> WhirledPress I cleaned it up a bit and wow am i close to having this thing done. Last step for me is to be able to update the Visual area with whatever is listed in the editor area. http://jsfiddle.net/w0tLy4rd/40/
[03:59:38] <MrGate> i can figure it out from here thanks WhirledPress :) i kinda new to jquery so im still trying to get my grips on it. i mostly stay in C
[03:59:47] <MACscr> btw, do you have paypal so i can send you a donation?
[04:00:04] <MACscr> you have gone way beyond with your help tonight
[04:00:44] <WhirledPress> Honestly, it's what this channel is all about. I learned every little bit that I know from here. Glad to help when I can. But thank you. Pay it forward and help the next guy.
[04:03:08] <MrGate> Will do, any good articles for making a library ? because right now i have everything in a large .js file with $(document).ready()
[04:03:33] <MrGate> i'd like to be able to call my editor like FormEditor("#editor");
[04:28:57] <MACscr> Am i missing something basic? why am i getting markup on the left when I click on Update Visual versus the actual element? http://jsfiddle.net/w0tLy4rd/44/
[04:31:13] <WhirledPress> not sure. I'll check in just a second. Here's a start to the update_visual..
[04:31:14] <WhirledPress> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/w0tLy4rd/45/
[04:31:52] <WhirledPress> You don't need to clone the code editor, just take it's value
[04:32:12] <WhirledPress> only the stage has to be cloned...it's the one with the interactive elements that take time to re-initialize...
[04:33:00] <WhirledPress> The problem you are going to have is that when you update visual, it either has to destroy your existing visual or do some heavy duty checking to see if the same elements exist
[04:33:20] <MACscr> i have no problem destroying it to be honest
[04:33:47] <WhirledPress> And since the visual wraps elements in .pub_element divs, you have to re-wrap all non-wrapped elements in the editor...
[04:34:48] <MACscr> hmm, so far this looks to be fully working. wow
[04:34:57] <MACscr> thanks man. i couldnt have gotten this far this fast without you
[04:35:14] <fattest> Is it possible to send another argument to my function on my button click? https://jsfiddle.net/7kgrbtyr/
[04:36:50] <WhirledPress> MACscr, I gotta run, but here is the last piece. It works pretty well if you destroy all the visual elements. Even if you go back and forth a couple times, it seems to work. http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/w0tLy4rd/47/
[04:44:18] <ctmarco> Hello all ajaxForm()

[04:44:36] <ctmarco> I have there beforeSubmit\
[04:49:39] <PhpNoob> hi
[04:49:45] <PhpNoob> anyone know that? http://hemantnegi.github.io/jquery.sumoselect/sumoselect_demo.html
[04:49:46] <fattest> hello
[04:49:56] <PhpNoob> i cannot use reload item
[04:50:44] <PhpNoob> anyone know?
[05:16:39] <Duikb00t> Hola
[05:21:02] <forgotmynick> Hola
[05:52:25] <ctmarco> What $.fn() means?
[05:54:47] <Cork> () means nothing there
[05:54:55] <Cork> $.fn is a short hand for $.prototype
[05:55:16] <Cork> and that is all the functions you get access to when you do $(something).<functions>
[05:58:08] <ctmarco> Cork
[05:58:15] <ctmarco> For what purpose is it?
[05:58:38] <Cork> uh... read the response...
[06:24:15] <PhpNoob> hi anyone know sumoselect jquery?
[06:24:21] <PhpNoob> https://hemantnegi.github.io/jquery.sumoselect/
[06:24:40] <PhpNoob> i have problem with reload option.
[06:24:53] <PhpNoob> reload option is resetting all checkbox
[06:24:57] <PhpNoob> i dont want it.
[06:25:22] <PhpNoob> 466 users and nobody answer?
[06:25:47] <PhpNoob> comon guys please help for this problem to me
[06:30:13] <PhpNoob> hey anyone there?
[06:34:19] <stennowork> no patience
[06:54:55] <TheWild> hello
[06:55:12] <TheWild> why does jQuery.each use this as element, but jQuery.map not
[06:55:15] <TheWild> ?
[07:18:28] <stennowork> TheWild, pretty sure it does
[07:19:33] <stennowork> TheWild, yeah it does
[07:19:46] <stennowork> $([1,2,3]).map(function() { console.log(this); });
[07:19:52] <stennowork> outputs 1 2 3
[07:20:37] <TheWild> $.map([1, 2], function() { return this + 1 }) // nope
[07:20:47] <TheWild> oh, that way
[07:21:18] <TheWild> I thought $(...) only accepts selector, HTML nodes or jQuery objects
[07:23:36] <stennowork> yeah they are two different things
[07:23:53] <stennowork> $.map(array, callback) takes one argument as the current element
[07:24:23] <stennowork> $(array).map(callback); has `this` given as element
[07:25:24] <stennowork> apparently jquery advises to use $.map if you just want to traverse an array - but then again you could just use javascripts native .map
[07:25:35] <stennowork> so array.map(callback)
[07:50:13] <ctmarco> https://jsfiddle.net/m7ox3nxo/  How i can addd after submit remove class here?
[07:53:24] <Cork> ctmarco: you would have to check what options ajaxForm has
[07:53:47] <Cork> also beforeSubmit might be enough
[07:54:32] <Cork> if you by after submit mean when the response gets back, you want to wrap the $.wpcAjaxSuccess in a function and do it there
[08:00:39] <ctmarco> Cork i have problem
[08:00:54] <ctmarco> Cork after submit i have image what need disaper
[08:01:02] <ctmarco> But it doesnt
[08:01:04] <ctmarco> )=
[08:43:11] <MACscr> WhirledPress what do you think about setting it up so that the code between Visual and the Code sync without the use of buttons? Im not sure how that would work though when typing stuff as it obviously wouldnt work with incomplete code http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/w0tLy4rd/47/
[08:45:42] <MACscr> I just feel that if im going to save published the finished content, do i take it from the code or the visual? how would i know the which one the user has newest code at. Do i really rely on them updating properly
[08:45:58] <MACscr> i could set some alerts i guess
[09:19:39] <TheWild> stennowork: thanks for info. My coworker did $(arr) where arr was array of records from database and he wanted to take only one field. Something crazy happened and he got array of HTML elements.
[09:20:04] <stennowork> lol that sounds interesting
[09:20:24] <stennowork> oh yeah
[09:20:43] <stennowork> in $.map, this is document or so?
[09:21:00] <stennowork> oh no, window, figures
[09:23:14] <stennowork> TheWild, confirmed that the callback of $.map just gets passed the parent scope
[09:24:28] <stennowork> TheWild, eh never mind
[09:24:46] <stennowork> TheWild, seems always to be window
[09:25:42] <TheWild> interesting that $.each actually uses `this`
[09:26:21] <stennowork> yeah
[09:27:30] <stennowork> TheWild, also you cannot break out of the iteration by returning false in the callback
[09:27:35] <stennowork> for $.map
[09:27:50] <stennowork> actually that one makes sense i guess
[09:27:54] <stennowork> wouldn't want to break out of map
[09:33:58] <TheWild> yup
[09:34:31] <TheWild> doable, throw 'End'
[09:34:49] <stennowork> duh :P
[09:34:55] <stennowork> well thats not really clean :P
[09:35:00] <stennowork> but yeah you hsouldn't do it anyway
[09:35:41] <TheWild> I don't think I would be able to recover the result
[09:44:07] <fuchstronaut> Having a set of elements that are siblings (and have no parent) how to I find one using a selector?=

[11:33:04] <Sal> like: <div id="a" class="c"></div><div id="b" class="c"></div>  $('.c').on('click'...) then $('.a').off('click'...)
[11:33:22] <Sal> ops, .a = #a
[11:41:51] <onlygod> Hi , This guide show how to delete all telegram contacts by Telegram web app , How may i copy contact list ? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39594862/how-to-delete-all-contacts-in-telegram
[11:46:04] <robertmaxrees> onlygod you sure you're in the right place?
[11:46:25] <onlygod> robertmaxrees: check the link
[11:46:45] <robertmaxrees> sal pretty easy to test.
[11:47:14] <robertmaxrees> onlygod confused about how this is related to jquery heh.
[11:47:53] <robertmaxrees> also a little leery about entering my phone number into a random webapp./
[11:51:00] <robertmaxrees> aaaah i see.  onlygod you saw the js provided in that answer and now you're looking for a similar mass export option?
[11:51:01] <jak2000> hiall!!!
[11:51:47] <onlygod> robertmaxrees: yes export or simple copying all contacts ..
[11:52:22] <robertmaxrees> onlygod if you can provide us with some example html in a jsfiddle or something, we can help you figure something out.
[12:01:26] <onlygod> robertmaxrees: telegram is known app
[12:02:00] <robertmaxrees> onlygod and not a jquery project (shrug)
[12:02:11] <robertmaxrees> are you expecting us to create an account to help you?
[12:02:52] <robertmaxrees> can't really help if we can't see what we're working with.  and i'm not gonna install an app just to help here ;)
[12:47:30] <onlygod> robertmaxrees: there is no need to install with web app
[12:47:46] <robertmaxrees> onlygod i can't access the app without an account >.>
[12:48:02] <onlygod> http://web.telegram.org/
[12:48:18] <robertmaxrees> we can help you figure out a solution though!
[12:48:49] <robertmaxrees> if you want to grab some sample markup for the page in question, we can take a look at it :)
[12:54:05] <juinn> hey guys i had some help with my script the other day from some of you guys...but getting an error on line 40 if someone help again please http://jsfiddle.net/pp0ecwz7/
[12:55:15] <robertmaxrees> what's the error?
[12:55:48] <juinn> TypeError: previous.val(...) is undefined
[12:56:05] <juinn> robertmaxrees: you was the guy who helped me on this problem...
[12:56:17] <robertmaxrees> heh, i barely remember what i ate for breakfast ;)
[12:56:19] <jak2000> hi all
[12:56:24] <robertmaxrees> plus i have my own job and stuff heh
[12:56:30] <robertmaxrees> sooooo gonna need to learnm.
[12:56:57] <juinn> haha
[12:57:18] <juinn> well console throws a problem with line 40 although it works
[12:57:21] <robertmaxrees> anyway - so why do you think you're getting that error?
[12:57:34] <juinn> mainly cause im a no0b
[12:57:44] <robertmaxrees> i mean the code reason.
[12:57:58] <juinn> but in all seriously im not sure =/
[12:58:10] <robertmaxrees> so how would you troubleshoot?
[12:58:10] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:58:12] <juinn> i wanna check if the previous has any val
[12:58:16] <robertmaxrees> good learning opportunity
[12:58:25] <juinn> console.log
[12:58:40] <robertmaxrees> looks like you're always grabbing the previous element and then checking its value.
[12:58:47] <robertmaxrees> can you think of when that would fail?
[12:59:18] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:59:34] <juinn> http://jsfiddle.net/pp0ecwz7/1/   console bring up val fine
[13:00:06] <robertmaxrees> you see it twice though.
[13:00:07] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:00:32] <robertmaxrees> think of it this way: you're always getting the previous element and then nabbing its val().  .previous() can return nothing.
[13:00:43] <robertmaxrees> an empty jquery object.
[13:01:04] <robertmaxrees> so the .length will fail because there's no .val()
[13:01:16] <juinn> http://jsfiddle.net/pp0ecwz7/3/
[13:01:27] <juinn> figured it :)
[13:01:30] <robertmaxrees> ereeh.
[13:02:04] <juinn> no?
[13:02:06] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pp0ecwz7/5/
[13:02:20] <robertmaxrees> you want to know if there's a previous in the first place.
[13:02:32] <robertmaxrees> also: don't use ==.  use ===
[13:02:56] <juinn> ok
[13:03:03] <juinn> robertmaxrees: still same prob on your demo
[13:03:27] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pp0ecwz7/6/
[13:03:29] <robertmaxrees> want &&, not ||
[13:04:25] <juinn> robertmaxrees: beautiful :) thank you
[13:04:56] <juinn> makes sense
[13:06:47] <juinn> one more quick question if i may.  i'm using ajax but should i being using post instead?
[13:06:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:07:00] <robertmaxrees> you can post with ajax.
[13:07:15] <juinn> $.ajax $.post
[13:07:26] <taplar> consideration... if you don't want the users to click on following inputs until the previous ones are filled, why not disable them?
[13:07:46] <robertmaxrees> juinn $.post uses $.ajax() under the hood.
[13:07:52] <robertmaxrees> it's just a shortcut method.,
[13:07:56] <juinn> ok so doesnt matter
[13:08:00] <juinn> oki
[13:08:48] <juinn> taplar: good point...think i'll leave it as it is now before i break it :)
[13:09:16] <taplar> if you are afraid of touching it for fear of breaking it, that's a code smell
[13:09:18] <robertmaxrees> this brings up a separate question: why three sepearate inputs at all?
[13:10:59] <juinn> well when field 3 has value i can verify pin
[13:11:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:11:11] <robertmaxrees> you can verify any input.
[13:11:16] <juinn> then again yeah could have 1 input
[13:11:28] <robertmaxrees> skip all this extra rigamorole
[13:12:27] <juinn> just how i've seen it done...my bank sends me a 3 digit pin and has a simular interface
[13:13:14] <taplar> imho, if you are going to keep the three inputs, personally i'd look into if validate can do what you want with some rule definitions
[13:13:37] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:13:51] <robertmaxrees> juinn also: do you work for a bank?
[13:22:31] <juinn> robertmaxrees: no i don't work in a bank...was refering to my online banking
[13:23:00] <robertmaxrees> so then why look to a band for UI guidance?
[13:23:02] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:23:21] <juinn> just thought it looked cool
[13:23:26] <robertmaxrees> heh, 'kay.
[13:23:28] <juinn> taplar: what validation rules?
[13:24:07] <juinn> user can only use numbers to input
[13:24:24] <juinn> could recheck that value is integer at the end i suppose
[13:24:44] <taplar> https://jqueryvalidation.org/
[13:25:57] <taplar> the validation you are trying to do, you're not the only one who's ever needed to do it, ;)
[13:26:27] <taplar> i'd give it a go and see if you can put down the chisel
[13:27:07] <taplar> https://jqueryvalidation.org/digits-method/
[13:31:54] <juinn> taplar: i generally do use validation for my forms
[13:32:10] <juinn> think if (/\d{3}/.test(verification_pin)){   will be enough?
[13:33:16] <taplar> at the end?
[13:33:48] <juinn> http://jsfiddle.net/pp0ecwz7/8/    from line 46
[13:34:38] <taplar> so you mean check that for every input?
[13:34:44] <fuchstronaut> \d{3} will also match foo123bar
[13:35:33] <juinn> ops ^$
[13:35:50] <fuchstronaut> I also would recommend using some kind of validation lib
[13:36:07] <fuchstronaut> I would go for something that does not depend on jQuery thou
[13:36:14] <fuchstronaut> validatejs was good to me
[13:37:04] <taplar> i'd just set the maxlength of the field to 3 and make sure there were no non digits in it.  you're going to have to have validation for it on the backend anyways
[13:37:40] <juinn> yeah server side will catch it
[13:38:27] <fuchstronaut> than again validation can be so easy client side if you don't reinvent the wheel, that you can give your user instant feedback
[13:38:31] <fuchstronaut> :p
[13:39:05] <taplar> sure.  but validation on client side is for user experience.  you can't not have backend validation.  that's where your security is
[13:39:42] <taplar> anyone who says you don't need backend validation, punch them
[13:40:19] <fuchstronaut> agree. just wanted to advocate for a solution that is not using custom written regex
[13:40:33] <taplar> sure
[14:17:10] <PhpNoob> hi
[14:17:19] <PhpNoob> my code is http://kopy.io/XsU7o its ok but when i unselect all item from category in subcat there is still show some items.
[14:17:26] <PhpNoob> its sumoselect : http://hemantnegi.github.io/jquery.sumoselect/sumoselect_demo.html
[14:17:45] <robertmaxrees> PhpNoob can you make a fiddle?
[14:17:56] <PhpNoob> my data is dynamic
[14:18:03] <PhpNoob> coming from mysql
[14:18:11] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.  the success functil can be extracted out and given static data to show us the issue.
[14:18:25] <robertmaxrees> *function
[14:18:42] <PhpNoob> let me check
[14:19:06] <PhpNoob> but demo and document is here for sumo select http://hemantnegi.github.io/jquery.sumoselect/sumoselect_demo.html
[14:19:35] <robertmaxrees> sure - your particular issue seems to be tied to how you're using it.
[14:20:14] <PhpNoob> how fix?
[14:20:20] <robertmaxrees> well.
[14:20:29] <robertmaxrees> if i can't see your data and replicate, how do you expect me to help?
[14:20:49] <PhpNoob> i send my code
[14:21:01] <robertmaxrees> but it doesn't have your data....
[14:21:03] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[14:22:56] <MikeD_> i have an input and the keyup function is getting the input .val() - and that's correct for numer input, but if I enter "-" or "--" the val is zero-length string
[14:23:08] <PhpNoob> :(
[14:23:16] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ huh?
[14:24:32] <MikeD_> yeah, that's where I'm scratching my head - it seems like .val() isn't returning the value of "---"
[14:24:40] <robertmaxrees> can you show this happening?
[14:25:02] <MikeD_> no, i tried a fiddle to see it... and that works as i expected
[14:25:15] <robertmaxrees> what version of jq on your site?
[14:25:54] <robertmaxrees> lol PhpNoob
[14:26:31] <PhpNoob> 1.9.1
[14:26:39] <robertmaxrees> no not you, MikeD_
[14:26:41] <MikeD_> 1.11.0
[14:26:56] <robertmaxrees> PhpNoob i was laughing because you asked the same thing in another channel and got much the same answer.
[14:27:20] <PhpNoob> javascript?
[14:27:25] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:27:34] <PhpNoob> lol i just trying to get help
[14:27:39] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[14:27:44] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) then you'll get help.
[14:28:43] <PhpNoob> i dont know how to do that to jsfield
[14:28:46] <PhpNoob> because its dynamic
[14:28:55] <robertmaxrees> so instead of using ajax.
[14:29:01] <robertmaxrees> just copy the data and use that instead.
[14:29:05] <MikeD_> i think it might be related to alert()
[14:29:32] <MikeD_> this embedded browser doesn't have console
[14:30:01] <robertmaxrees> can you run your test using a real browser instead?
[14:30:06] <robertmaxrees> just for that piece.
[14:34:51] <robertmaxrees> PhpNoob https://jsfiddle.net/Lj01j7nk/ just plop in your relevant HTMl and define the struff that isn't defined
[14:34:58] <robertmaxrees> that's how you make a test case for this.
[14:36:45] <MikeD_> heh, yeah i started down the road and wasn't reproducing the exact behavior because it was too simple a test case
[14:36:55] <robertmaxrees> ah
[14:37:28] <MikeD_> is jsfiddle console broken right now?  i get nothing when i use console.log( "a" );
[14:37:37] <MikeD_> it might be i should just call it a day
[14:37:41] <robertmaxrees> err.
[14:37:45] <robertmaxrees> you use your browser's cojnsole
[14:38:02] <MikeD_> yeah, and nothing logs there
[14:38:08] <robertmaxrees> link?
[14:38:14] <PhpNoob> robertmaxrees
[14:38:18] <PhpNoob> i click it
[14:38:39] <robertmaxrees> PhpNoob you just need to fill int he stuff it doesn't have.
[14:38:41] <robertmaxrees> the plugin, etc.
[14:39:02] <MikeD_> https://jsfiddle.net/32w894f8/3/
[14:39:03] <PhpNoob> you mean form?
[14:39:17] <MikeD_> i see nothing in firebug console, that might just be me
[14:39:19] <robertmaxrees> PhpNoob i mean the relevant html, the plugin, and the data you're using that doesn't work.
[14:39:31] <robertmaxrees> mikebald for starters, don't use firebug any more hehj
[14:39:39] <robertmaxrees> err, MikeD_
[14:39:40] <robertmaxrees> my bad
[14:39:41] <PhpNoob> https://jsfiddle.net/Lj01j7nk/1/ updated
[14:39:56] <MikeD_> what's wrong with firebug?
[14:40:01] <robertmaxrees> it's antiquated.
[14:40:08] <robertmaxrees> and all but deprecated.
[14:40:08] <PhpNoob> is that enough?
[14:40:16] <robertmaxrees> the firebug team is working on the native dev tools now.
[14:40:20] <PhpNoob> sorry i'm angry to someone in javascript channel
[14:40:23] <MikeD_> so when i hit F12 and that's what opens... what do i do to fix that?
[14:40:30] <Uhku> MikeD_: remove firebug
[14:40:39] <robertmaxrees> PhpNoob ... how is this helpful?
[14:40:42] <robertmaxrees> again.
[14:40:51] <robertmaxrees> need markup, data, and the plugin included as well.
[14:41:38] <robertmaxrees> otherwise there's literally no reasonable way for us to help you.
[14:42:20] <PhpNoob> updated
[14:42:27] <robertmaxrees> gotta paste the new link.
[14:42:30] <PhpNoob> http://hemantnegi.github.io/jquery.sumoselect/sumoselect_demo.html
[14:42:36] <PhpNoob> https://jsfiddle.net/Lj01j7nk/2/
[14:42:41] <PhpNoob> i added plugins
[14:42:54] <robertmaxrees> hit "update"
[14:42:57] <robertmaxrees> anmd send the new link.
[14:43:05] <PhpNoob> https://jsfiddle.net/Lj01j7nk/3/
[14:43:21] <MikeD_> ok, so now developer tools is open and still nothing
[14:43:22] <robertmaxrees> nonono
[14:43:23] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:43:50] <PhpNoob> what
[14:43:54] <robertmaxrees> PhpNoob you can't just link to github.io as a cdn.
[14:44:03] <robertmaxrees> and you use the external resources oin the left to include libs.
[14:44:04] <PhpNoob> i dont know how is work
[14:44:11] <robertmaxrees> http://rawgit.com/
[14:44:15] <robertmaxrees> this'll ge tyou links that work.
[14:44:25] <PhpNoob> what is it?
[14:44:28] <robertmaxrees> nab one of the usable urls and toss it into the external resources.
[14:44:41] <robertmaxrees> it'll give you versions of those files that'll work with jsfiddle.
[14:45:02] <PhpNoob> paste and nothing do that
[14:45:08] <MikeD_> nm, now it's working - idk
[14:45:30] <PhpNoob> robertmaxrees can you connect to my pc?
[14:45:33] <PhpNoob> with teamviewe
[14:45:34] <PhpNoob> r
[14:45:38] <robertmaxrees> PhpNoob no.
[14:45:42] <robertmaxrees> not a good way to get help, either.
[14:45:43] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/HemantNegi/jquery.sumoselect
[14:45:46] <robertmaxrees> use the files form here.
[14:45:49] <PhpNoob> how can i show you
[14:45:52] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:46:00] <robertmaxrees> use the actual repo files for rawgit
[14:46:24] <PhpNoob> rawgit doesnt work
[14:46:25] <PhpNoob> i dont know why
[14:46:28] <robertmaxrees> yes
[14:46:29] <robertmaxrees> it does
[14:46:38] <robertmaxrees> if yopu use the links from the repo and not github.io
[14:46:43] <robertmaxrees> just tried it and it was fine.
[14:46:44] <PhpNoob> i paste link
[14:46:52] <robertmaxrees> you pasted the io link.
[14:46:55] <robertmaxrees> not the one from the repo
[14:46:59] <PhpNoob> i paste this : https://github.com/HemantNegi/jquery.sumoselect
[14:47:08] <robertmaxrees> you nbeed to paste the specific file.
[14:47:11] <robertmaxrees> not the whole repo...
[14:47:35] <robertmaxrees> also: html is not defined in your fiddle.
[14:47:45] <robertmaxrees> gotta use some sample da3ta for that.
[14:48:16] <PhpNoob> https://jsfiddle.net/Lj01j7nk/4/ now ok i think
[14:48:35] <robertmaxrees> oine last time...
[14:48:42] <robertmaxrees> html isn't defined there.
[14:48:42] <PhpNoob> what?
[14:48:46] <robertmaxrees> you need to define it yourself.
[14:48:51] <robertmaxrees> optherwise you're not replicating the issue.
[14:49:00] <PhpNoob> i just copy html
[14:49:03] <PhpNoob> its dynamic php
[14:49:10] <PhpNoob> and data is also dynamic
[14:49:14] <robertmaxrees> it's static markup to jquery
[14:49:17] <robertmaxrees> and static data.
[14:49:25] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't care about how it gets generated, just that it did.
[14:49:27] <PhpNoob> i dont understand
[14:49:37] <robertmaxrees> jqwueyr consumes whatevewr data is returned.
[14:49:44] <robertmaxrees> so you need to give us a sample bit of that data.
[14:49:57] <robertmaxrees> you can go to the network tab on your site, look for that ajax call, and then copy the response body.
[14:50:01] <robertmaxrees> that's a great palce to start.
[14:50:12] <robertmaxrees> i gotta get lunch.
[14:50:20] <robertmaxrees> see y'all in a while.
[14:51:53] <PhpNoob> lol
[15:05:49] <dRealm> what is a delegated event handler?
[15:05:52] <dRealm> http://api.jquery.com/off/
[15:06:43] <shoky_> dRealm: https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[15:06:53] <dRealm> $("myElement").on('click', function() { console.log("Hello world");} );
[15:26:54] <jak2000> robertLunch!!!
[15:27:02] <jak2000> WhirledPress hi
[15:28:23] <fission6> in an on("change") whats the best way to access the value of you are binding to a change event on select? i want the value of the option chosen, is it e.target.value, is that the ideal way
[15:28:55] <taplar> that should work
[15:30:31] <fission6> taplar: cool, now how would i hide all options in another select, where data-brand-id == e.target.value
[15:31:35] <taplar> $(otherSelectSelector).find('option').filter(function(){ return $(this).data('brand-id') === e.target.value; }).hide();
[15:34:50] <fission6> interessting, let me play thanks
[15:35:11] <fission6> i dont think hide() works well on option elements
[15:35:23] <fission6> ahhh damn it
[15:35:27] <fission6> i bet its select2
[15:36:08] <jak2000> hi all, http://markcell.github.io/jquery-tabledit/#examples  anyone can see the javascript of the Example #6? when user edit the row, how to validate the email? or if is a Date or if is a Number?
[15:36:28] <jak2000> any advice or idea?
[15:37:34] <MikeD_> what criteria do you use to validate the email?
[15:41:00] <jak2000> if have an @ by sample
[15:41:08] <jak2000> or if have spaces
[15:41:14] <MikeD_> oh, then you can use regex, right?
[15:41:15] <jak2000> basic validation
[15:41:19] <jak2000> yes
[15:41:26] <jak2000> MikeD_ you see the page?
[15:41:29] <MikeD_> yeah

[15:42:50] <jak2000> is the code of the plugin....
[15:42:55] <jak2000> where recommend me validate?
[15:43:08] <MikeD_> are you writing the plugin or just using it?
[15:45:01] <jak2000> i use
[15:45:14] <jak2000> with taplar(him) helped me to modfy something
[15:45:18] <jak2000> but finally i use
[15:47:24] <MikeD_> the idea of making tables editable like this is scary
[15:47:54] <MikeD_> i mean making SQL tables editable via a jquery plugin called on a table... is scary
[16:02:05] <MikeD_> was i wrong to suggest that  (it looked a bit like a rage-quit)
[16:03:04] <taplar> *shrug*
[16:03:32] <taplar> i didn't really see the SQL tie in myself
[16:06:11] <MikeD_> most databases have tools to manage them... and mysql has phpmyadmin... so building a table editor in html seems crazy
[16:06:51] <taplar> where are you getting the sql tie in?  they could just be editing tabular data
[16:08:15] <MikeD_> good question - i assume rows and columns of data being passed via xhr/ajax to a backend server is about data and that means sql to me
[16:08:26] <taplar> heh
[16:08:30] <MikeD_> but i guess there are other ways to use tables
[16:08:33] <taplar> doesn't mean they are altering table structures
[16:26:52] <skypce> hello all
[16:27:18] <skypce> how can i add a class to element only when a class is present ?
[16:28:05] <skypce> by example i have class hover, that appear only when menu is hovered, i need do something only when class hover is present
[16:29:59] <taplar> you can filter on the class
[16:30:47] <taplar> are you saying that the class 'hover' is being added when the user hovers over an element and removed when they leave?
[16:30:51] <skypce> taplar show me a example plese
[16:30:53] <skypce> please
[16:31:03] <skypce> exactly taplar
[16:31:12] <taplar> what are you wanting to do in that event?
[16:31:28] <skypce> i want change the background color of the parent header
[16:31:53] <skypce> that shows in particula color only when menu is expanded
[16:32:09] <Buoy172> skypce: I think you can do that with CSS
[16:32:17] <taplar> do you control the logic that adds and removes the class?
[16:32:43] <taplar> Buoy172: i didn't think you could base css rules for parents off of children, only for children off of parents
[16:33:02] <Buoy172> http://jsfiddle.net/u7tYE/
[16:33:28] <taplar> that's not a parent child relationship
[16:33:34] <taplar> those are siblings
[16:33:56] <Buoy172> Who asked for parent-child? and why wouldn't it work for parent-child?
[16:34:00] <taplar> then again i'm assuming parent child due to 'parent header' but i could be wrong
[16:34:51] <taplar> i'm saying parent.hover child is valid to conditionally change child.  but parent child.hover doesn't conditionally affect parent
[16:35:26] <taplar> afaik css rules only go down
[16:36:28] <skypce> taplar, this is my code
[16:36:29] <skypce> http://pastebin.com/fzyWaKa6
[16:36:29] <jak2017> MikeD_ i am disconnected wich plugin recommend me?
[16:36:40] <skypce> i have a lot of markup i am using drupal
[16:36:48] <skypce> i can not do in other waty
[16:36:49] <skypce> way
[16:38:21] <taplar> i'm thinking you should probably bind a hover event to the lis and make your change in there
[16:38:36] <taplar> if you can't change whatever logic is putting that sfHover on the lis
[16:39:07] <skypce> sounds complex
[16:39:14] <skypce> i will add only a click event
[16:39:22] <skypce> when click in menu header will change
[16:40:01] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[16:40:48] <skypce> i have other idea taplar
[16:40:49] <skypce> lenght
[16:40:57] <skypce> length
[16:41:03] <taplar> eh?
[16:41:26] <skypce> when submenu have lenght or display block add the class
[16:41:48] <taplar> when you going to check that?
[16:42:22] <MikeD_> apparently <input type="number" /> in IE10 ignores values that aren't ... wait for it ... numbers
[16:42:47] <taplar> kinda makes sense
[16:43:33] <skypce> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15924751/check-if-a-element-is-displaynone-or-block-on-click-jquery
[16:43:43] <MikeD_> https://jsfiddle.net/32w894f8/4/
[16:44:05] <taplar> skypce: why not use hover?
[16:44:10] <MikeD_> i spent 3+ hours trying to figure out why
[16:44:40] <skypce> ok taplar i will use hove
[16:44:41] <skypce> hover
[16:44:41] <MikeD_> oh well, tomorrow is another day - thanks all
[16:45:04] <skypce> ahahah csdock keyboarsd
[16:46:22] <cannap> lol
[16:46:35] <cannap> you cann just use .css
[16:46:48] <cannap> when you dont pass object or string
[16:46:53] <cannap> it will return the currente value
[16:47:34] <jak2017> MikeD_ ?
[16:47:48] <taplar> cannap: wut?
[16:48:54] <cannap> i dont know
[16:48:55] <cannap> hi
[17:08:34] <WhirledPress> MikeD_ I think you mean $("#bar").val(v); on line 4.
[17:13:20] <hlve> taplar, dev-to-dev question about javascript organizing.
[17:13:24] <hlve> not really jquery related though
[17:13:34] <hlve> just a off-topic question about preference
[17:13:38] <hlve> we have a utilities.js, would you consider a function that disables context menu a utility-worthy function?
[17:13:38] <taplar> k?
[17:14:17] <taplar> is 'context menu' a generic object used in multiple places?
[17:14:53] <hlve> well, this is a micro-service, so there's not a ton of places it could live. it's used twice in the single page.
[17:15:35] <taplar> my gut reaction is that that logic would be in some section related specifically to the context menus
[17:15:57] <hlve> is there a more global file that should be created for functions like that?
[17:16:13] <hlve> it's disabling the native browser context menu
[17:16:26] * hlve is struggling to write this re-org userstory.
[17:16:56] <taplar> i can't really say 'should'.  all depends on how you have things layed out
[17:17:32] <taplar> like, typically we have script files with logic specific to each page, and one application script that is for shared logic
[17:17:52] <hlve> they're a mess currently. Right now, the single function and event binds are in their own seperate file called 'disblecontextmenu.js", I was suggesting moving that into a utilities file, to reduce http calls, etc.
[17:18:06] <taplar> but there are times i wish we had our classes organized by objects, rather than by page
[17:18:10] <hlve> single page app, and the app is broken into multiple services. this is just one 'service' of the app.
[17:18:30] <hlve> so all of the js files in this service are related to this specific area of the app
[17:19:16] <taplar> oh, if you are worried about http calls, you should look into combining your files on the backend
[17:19:35] <hlve> we're going to be bundling after, this is just low level stuff before we get to bundling the JS.
[17:19:40] <taplar> when you build your app, merge all the js files, uglify and compress them
[17:19:58] <hlve> It's also to reduce the excess in tech debt (ie, 30 JS files, that should be contained within 7 or 8)
[17:20:05] <taplar> sure
[17:20:34] <hlve> so beyond that, would it be an 'alright' suggestion to say we should move that function into a utilities.js, or global.js?
[17:21:07] <taplar> i don't have an argument against it
[17:21:21] <taplar> i'm not a big organization guru, ^_^
[17:44:57] <hlve> another small question, taplar -- if you're up for it.
[17:45:12] <taplar> sure
[17:45:27] <hlve> So, currently we have a ton of files like: http://pastebin.com/6E0Jb9hL
[17:47:25] <taplar> what testing library is that?
[17:48:43] <hlve> ignore 'test' that was dumby text
[17:51:01] <hlve> ah shoot. sec. didn't include all the code
[17:51:58] <hlve> it's basically using $.extend to namespace, I think
[18:01:00] <hlve> any thoughts?
[18:01:18] <taplar> not sure what you're asking about
[18:01:39] * hlve shrugs
[18:02:12] <taplar> heh
[18:05:35] <hlve> http://pastebin.com/z3JHpvEY that's the actual code.
[18:06:01] <hlve> as you can see, we're using .extend to create a namespace (test.), and then registering more namespaces off of test.
[18:06:20] <hlve> Idk why this was written this way, it seems awfully dumb to namespace off of extend.
[18:06:57] <hlve> but my question was, if you had a ton of these .extends, and wanted to place them in a single file, keeping them all together (namespaces.js or something?) what would you call it?
[18:07:05] <hlve> robertmaxrees, thoughts on this?
[18:07:05] <hlve> <:
[18:07:39] <taplar> seems like they wanted to have namespacing, have it split up in different files, and not have to worry if any of the nestings along the way were already created or not
[18:08:32] <hlve> but if there was a single file that created the namespace before any functions called them, would it not have the same outcome?
[18:09:02] <taplar> sure
[18:09:45] <hlve> just feels unneccessary to have them scattered throughout 17 different js files, when some of those js files only contain the one .extend.
[18:09:46] <hlve> ;P
[18:10:22] <taplar> *shrug* someone probably got off on a modular kick and decided this was a good idea
[18:11:34] <taplar> i mean, jquery kinda does the same thing, in a way
[18:13:13] <taplar> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/master/src
[18:13:46] <taplar> though that's before it is all built into single file, but still the concept of separating logic into modular files is there
[18:39:56] * taplar hates H2, yes he do, yes he do
[18:39:57] <d2k> Hello guys, I'm still trying to load and init a translation of moments.js. I have a fiddle, but it does not have any translation approach because I'm not sure how. Any help would be great: http://pastebin.com/zey0Ftif
[18:41:07] <taplar> what do you mean translation?
[18:41:30] <taplar> and you have a fiddle?
[18:42:48] <d2k> taplar: Hi taplar, nice to see you. I need a spanisch output of moments.js, something fitting to my snippet. Bower and all that stuff is not my thing, so I found no manual approach that worked
[18:44:07] <d2k> taplar: the snippet is very basic, a output div and the script for the config of the moments.js. Moments.js is getting loaded via a CDN link (not showed in snippet): http://pastebin.com/zey0Ftif
[18:44:24] <taplar> yeah, that's not a fiddle though
[18:44:56] <d2k> taplar: True, I'm sorry...
[18:46:04] <taplar> and http://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/ has information about locales
[18:46:34] <taplar> iirc, you'll have to have included the file for the specific locale before you can use it
[18:46:44] <taplar> should be included in the download iirc
[18:47:51] <taplar> or if not you can probably pull it from here https://github.com/moment/moment/tree/develop/locale
[18:49:22] <d2k> taplar: I tried to download and use the spanish pack but it could it could be that the CDN link I use (the one they mention to use) is not compatible. I'm using this as CDN: http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.1.0/moment.min.js
[18:49:44] <taplar> that's the one without the locales
[18:49:56] <taplar> so if you want to use the spanish locale you will need to find and include that
[18:52:08] <d2k> taplar:  one moment, please
[18:56:09] * taplar wonders if that was an intentional pun
[18:56:36] <taplar> brb
[18:59:10] <taplar> b
[19:00:24] <taplar> my cinderella time is about to expire.  got it figured out?
[19:01:33] <Darmani> Hi guys! I'm trying to hide the default value for timepicker if the user doesn't pick a time when they create an "event" object
[19:01:34] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/e59409b648e224dc8433f2a325ffba6f
[19:02:08] <Darmani> For some reason though, this line comes back as "" and I'm not sure why.
[19:02:11] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/e59409b648e224dc8433f2a325ffba6f#file-ajax_call-js-L15
[19:05:41] * taplar pushes the shiny red button
[19:05:52] <Darmani> Lol
[19:06:39] <robertmaxrees> Darmani #event_start_date_time - how many of these are on the page?
[19:07:03] <Darmani> Only one at a given time. The ajax call loads that data in.
[19:07:21] <Darmani> There's #event_start_date_time & #event_end_date_time
[19:07:55] <robertmaxrees> stick console.log($('[id="event_start_date_time"]').length) right before you run that and see what it says
[19:08:58] <Darmani> checking
[19:09:43] <Darmani> nothing shows up in the console... o.o
[19:10:18] <robertmaxrees> right after that comment on line 14?
[19:10:19] <Darmani> I'm guessing because I need to look through this variable for that id
[19:10:20] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/e59409b648e224dc8433f2a325ffba6f#file-ajax_call-js-L8
[19:10:33] <robertmaxrees> hold up.
[19:10:49] <robertmaxrees> $(data).find("#event_start_date_time") why are you using .find() for an ID?
[19:11:08] <Darmani> should I not be using find()?
[19:11:14] <Darmani> It seemed like a good choice..
[19:11:23] <robertmaxrees> i guess i'm confused about what's going on here.
[19:11:51] <Darmani> So I'm making an ajax call to the db, if an "event" object is on that given day then I check the time with jquery
[19:12:13] <Darmani> if the given time is the default which is "12:00AM" then I set the val() to "" so it looks hidden.
[19:12:59] <robertmaxrees> are you actually getting into if( $(parsed_data[1]).hasClass("event-div") ){ ?
[19:13:21] <Darmani> yeah of course...
[19:13:24] <Darmani> I tested this.
[19:13:50] <robertmaxrees> but you said you didn't get taht console log?
[19:14:07] <robertmaxrees> can you share the data getting returned from the server?
[19:14:14] <Darmani> From the ajax call?
[19:15:19] <robertmaxrees> yes
[19:16:04] <Darmani> yeah hold up
[19:17:22] <Darmani> I added this line here
[19:17:24] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/mfifth/e59409b648e224dc8433f2a325ffba6f#file-ajax_call-js-L9
[19:18:27] <robertmaxrees> you could just look in your network tab (shrug)
[19:19:23] <Darmani> lol whatever
[19:19:39] <Darmani> Anyway what comes back is all that html as a string.
[19:19:47] <robertmaxrees> \
[19:19:50] <robertmaxrees> woops
[19:19:51] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[19:20:22] <robertmaxrees> soooo you know you could make this in a jsfiddle right?>
[19:20:35] <Darmani> why
[19:20:54] <robertmaxrees> then we can see the bug.
[19:21:00] <robertmaxrees> and interact with the coide and help fix it.
[19:21:07] <robertmaxrees> you using jqui's datepicker?
[19:21:23] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: yeah
[19:21:32] <Darmani> I'd make a jsfiddle but I'm not sure what to make it look like.
[19:21:56] <robertmaxrees> first off.
[19:22:06] <robertmaxrees> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/e59409b648e224dc8433f2a325ffba6f#file-ajax_call-js
[19:22:08] <robertmaxrees> fix this file.
[19:22:12] <robertmaxrees> make it the full valid js.
[19:22:32] <Darmani> what do you mean
[19:23:31] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/mdmnpbp5/
[19:23:33] <robertmaxrees> console errors.
[19:24:22] <robertmaxrees> nvm think i got it.
[19:24:25] <Darmani> I don't have any console errors o.o
[19:24:41] <robertmaxrees>  missing } after property list?
[19:24:48] <robertmaxrees> are you filtering your console.log messages?
[19:25:27] <robertmaxrees> anyway https://jsfiddle.net/mdmnpbp5/2/
[19:25:30] <robertmaxrees> hjere's a fiddle.
[19:25:56] <Darmani> yeah I see it.
[19:27:30] <Darmani> wait, does datepicker() actually have the default time set to an empty string?
[19:27:47] <robertmaxrees> like, when you initialize it?
[19:27:51] <Darmani> yeah
[19:27:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[19:27:58] <robertmaxrees> should.
[19:28:31] <d2k> I tried to get help from taplar. I know have a fiddle that works but only if I delete the language call: https://jsfiddle.net/mLgbdLch/11/
[19:28:32] <Darmani> What's weird is if you look at the html it actually shows the value='12:00AM'
[19:28:52] <robertmaxrees> look at what html?
[19:28:59] <Darmani> like the rendered html
[19:29:08] <Darmani> when you look at the source
[19:29:23] <robertmaxrees> from that console.log()?
[19:29:46] <Darmani> no the console log still shows nothing.
[19:29:55] <robertmaxrees> then your stuff is broken
[19:29:58] <robertmaxrees> using chrome?
[19:30:08] <Darmani> yep
[19:30:36] <robertmaxrees> see that little funnel looking thing next toi the clear icon in the console?
[19:30:55] <Darmani> yeah
[19:31:09] <robertmaxrees> click that to expand down the filter dealio.
[19:31:22] <Darmani> ok
[19:31:24] <robertmaxrees> \make sure you have "all" clicked to the right of the filter box.
[19:31:50] <Darmani> yep it is.
[19:32:04] <robertmaxrees> then kill and restart chrome.
[19:32:12] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: https://snag.gy/SUmX6Z.jpg
[19:32:12] <robertmaxrees> because something is hosed.
[19:33:14] <robertmaxrees> once i click on a date, i get the markup in the console.
[19:33:59] <Darmani> damn this is so weird.
[19:34:27] <robertmaxrees> seeing the error now?
[19:34:32] <robertmaxrees> 'cause i'm getting one.
[19:34:54] <Darmani> When I click on a date? no
[19:34:58] <robertmaxrees> really?
[19:35:18] <Darmani> console.log(data) right?
[19:35:26] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[19:35:45] <Darmani> what error are you getting?
[19:36:05] <robertmaxrees> i get the full output of html and then "Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: <div class="event-div">
[19:36:06] <robertmaxrees>       <f
[19:36:39] <Darmani> o.O
[19:36:48] <robertmaxrees> after clicking a date.
[19:36:53] <Darmani> no idea
[19:37:11] <robertmaxrees> you're looking at the fiddle, right?
[19:37:42] <Darmani> oh I wasn't looking at the fiddle
[19:37:43] <Darmani> my bad
[19:37:49] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:38:15] <robertmaxrees> either way, my guess is  $(data).find("#event_start_date_time").val("") is failing
[19:38:32] <Darmani> yeah there it is
[19:38:41] <robertmaxrees> but that could be that i'm not using the same version of jquery/jquery ui you're using.
[19:39:06] <Darmani> what the fuck does that error even mea
[19:39:07] <Darmani> mean
[19:39:22] <robertmaxrees> it means you're passing something to $() that it doesn't understand.
[19:39:34] <robertmaxrees> why are you parsing the html and then not using it during those .find() calls?
[19:40:00] <Darmani> Well I parsed the HTML the first time and then someone just told me to do $(data) instead
[19:40:20] <Darmani> so I did that for this line here https://gist.github.com/mfifth/e59409b648e224dc8433f2a325ffba6f#file-ajax_call-js-L16
[19:40:25] <robertmaxrees> but you're not getting that error on your end?
[19:40:35] <Darmani> oh no I see the error now on the fiddle
[19:40:40] <robertmaxrees> i mean in your local copy.
[19:40:44] <Darmani> oh
[19:40:47] <robertmaxrees> on your dev environment.
[19:40:48] <Darmani> no I don't see that.
[19:40:56] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery/jquery ui?
[19:41:11] <Darmani> lemme check
[19:41:48] <Darmani> 1.12.4
[19:42:21] <robertmaxrees> for which?
[19:42:30] <robertmaxrees> jquery?
[19:42:31] <XHFHX> Hi there - can anyone tell me why the code in line 21 doesnt work? It works on line 3 - http://pastebin.com/9wYiJ8DZ
[19:42:47] <XHFHX> when i enter the command in the console it works
[19:43:02] <Darmani> Well I'm using Rails so it's included through sprockets with a gem.
[19:43:23] <robertmaxrees> heh, i wonder if it's a quirk bnetween jq versions.
[19:43:27] <Darmani> jquery rails 4.2.1
[19:43:43] <robertmaxrees> XHFHX the display.val(0)?
[19:43:51] <XHFHX> robertmaxrees: yes
[19:44:03] <robertmaxrees> XHFHX does any of the other code in  $('.operator').on('click', function(event){ work?
[19:44:11] <XHFHX> everything works
[19:44:16] <XHFHX> til the end
[19:44:24] <robertmaxrees> so if you stick a console.log() before that line, you see it?
[19:44:29] <XHFHX> yes
[19:45:03] <XHFHX> i even can log $('#display') and get the proper value
[19:45:17] <XHFHX> i also tried .attrib('value', 0) but this doesnt work either
[19:45:28] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('[id="display"]').length)
[19:45:30] <XHFHX> seems like a JQ bug to me or I'm really dumb and not seeing something
[19:45:30] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[19:45:42] <robertmaxrees> heh, jquery wouldn't bug out on something this simple./
[19:46:09] <XHFHX> returns 1
[19:46:18] <robertmaxrees> can you put your markup somewhere for us to see then?
[19:46:42] <XHFHX> the whole html?
[19:46:51] <robertmaxrees> or just the relevant piece to recreate.
[19:46:57] <robertmaxrees> so we can spin up a test case.
[19:46:58] <XHFHX> one moment
[19:47:42] <XHFHX> here you go robertmaxrees http://pastebin.com/yXwe6cbJ
[19:48:56] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:49:41] <XHFHX> ?
[19:49:44] <XHFHX> does it work for you?
[19:49:46] <robertmaxrees> and you said you chjecked for errors?
[19:50:00] <XHFHX> dont get any errors in chrome
[19:50:18] <XHFHX> if you click on , or + the display should reset to 0
[19:50:24] <robertmaxrees> i see an error.
[19:50:37] <XHFHX> where?
[19:50:41] <robertmaxrees> the consolke
[19:50:53] <XHFHX> chrome?
[19:51:03] <robertmaxrees> console in any browser.
[19:51:18] <robertmaxrees> sec.
[19:52:12] <robertmaxrees> using your full JS and Markup i get NaN in the input field.
[19:52:35] <robertmaxrees> you getting the same thing?
[19:52:54] <XHFHX> no it works for me, except the calc isnt resetting after hitting + or -
[19:53:10] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:53:25] <robertmaxrees> you realize you have two handlers bound to .operator, right?
[19:54:15] <XHFHX> oh
[19:54:16] <XHFHX> ...
[19:54:23] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:54:33] <XHFHX> lol
[19:54:34] <robertmaxrees> hence why the original paste of code didn't seem to be broken to me :)
[19:54:34] <XHFHX> :D
[19:55:30] <XHFHX> lol :D thanks :)
[20:03:13] <jak2000> hi all
[20:03:22] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/dtn43f57/  why the length is 1?
[20:03:57] <robertmaxrees> because you can't repeat IDs
[20:04:29] <robertmaxrees> and you only have one tabcataeronaves on the page.
[20:09:51] <jak2000> ah ok i understand
[20:10:40] <robertmaxrees> what were you expecting?
[20:10:55] <Darmani> So if I set a breakpoint in chrome on the part that checks what time it is it will give me the correct value. But if I just do it from the console it gives me an empty string.
[20:11:04] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: ......
[20:11:18] <robertmaxrees> Darmani are you checking the data coming back from the ajax call?
[20:11:31] <Darmani> wut
[20:11:37] <Darmani> we already looked at that
[20:11:53] <robertmaxrees> " the part that checks what time it is
[20:11:53] <robertmaxrees> it will give me the correct value.
[20:11:59] <robertmaxrees> what are you referring to hyere?
[20:12:17] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/mfifth/e59409b648e224dc8433f2a325ffba6f#file-ajax_call-js-L16
[20:12:18] <Darmani> this
[20:12:41] <robertmaxrees> "But if I just do it from the console it gives me an empty string."
[20:12:47] <Darmani> ya
[20:12:49] <robertmaxrees> clarify?
[20:12:59] <robertmaxrees> like, what are you actually doing therE?
[20:13:13] <Darmani> So if I set a breakpoint, on that line from chrome, and check the value of $("#event_start_date_time")
[20:13:18] <Darmani> It comes back correctly.
[20:13:20] <Darmani> but
[20:13:27] <Darmani> if i do it from the console, without a breakpoint
[20:13:29] <Darmani> it's an empty string.
[20:13:41] <robertmaxrees> because the breakpoint sets a context for you.
[20:14:08] <robertmaxrees> since that ID exists only within the data you returned and not within the page itself, $("#event_start_date_time") is not the same as what you're doing ther.e
[20:14:40] <Darmani> i see
[20:14:55] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[20:15:13] <Darmani> yeah I get what you're saying.
[20:15:20] <Darmani> I just still don't see why it shouldn't work.
[20:15:52] <robertmaxrees> context.
[20:16:04] <robertmaxrees> $("#event_start_date_time").length from your console.
[20:16:12] <robertmaxrees> is it 0?
[20:16:39] <Darmani> it's 1
[20:17:01] <robertmaxrees> so then you're talking about two different elements.$(data).find("#event_start_date_time") is distinct from the one on the page.
[20:17:14] <Darmani> :O
[20:17:23] <Darmani> So there's more than one id on the page.
[20:17:31] <robertmaxrees> no.
[20:17:39] <robertmaxrees> $(data).find("#event_start_date_time") is using a document fragment.
[20:17:53] <Darmani> ok
[20:18:01] <robertmaxrees> $(data).find() is specific to said fragmenbt.
[20:18:10] <Darmani> yeah..
[20:18:19] <robertmaxrees> $('#event_start_date_time') is looking in the page.
[20:18:30] <Darmani> ohhh
[20:18:38] <Darmani> so that's why it doesn't work in the console.
[20:18:38] <robertmaxrees> so you ARE using the same ID twice, but one's in the fragment and the other is the actual page you're looking at.
[20:19:41] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: That makes total sense.
[20:20:30] <Darmani> But even then, when I check the fragment and see that the value is indeed what we're looking for, this line here doesn't do anything.
[20:20:31] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/e59409b648e224dc8433f2a325ffba6f#file-ajax_call-js-L17
[20:20:49] <robertmaxrees> $(data).find("#event_start_date_time").val("")
[20:20:58] <robertmaxrees> console.log($(data).find("#event_start_date_time").val());
[20:21:00] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[20:21:24] <Darmani> checking
[20:22:21] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: right here? https://gist.github.com/mfifth/e59409b648e224dc8433f2a325ffba6f#file-ajax_call-js-L9
[20:22:39] <robertmaxrees> no.
[20:22:49] <robertmaxrees> stick it right after you se it.
[20:22:51] <robertmaxrees> *set it
[20:22:56] <Darmani> oh
[20:22:57] <robertmaxrees> just like i had
[20:23:10] <Darmani> kk
[20:23:44] <Darmani> nothing comes up in the console
[20:23:45] <Darmani> wtf
[20:24:09] <robertmaxrees> empty line?
[20:24:11] <robertmaxrees> or nothing?
[20:24:21] <Darmani> nothing at all
[20:24:28] <robertmaxrees> so if you stick a console.log('foo'); before or after that new one, what do you get?
[20:24:49] <Darmani> oh never mind I'm an idiot I have to trigger the ajax call
[20:24:50] <Darmani> duh
[20:25:07] <Darmani> The value is still "12:00AM"
[20:29:18] <robertmaxrees> hrmmm...
[20:29:23] <Darmani> I got it.
[20:29:26] <Darmani> I figured it out.
[20:29:28] <robertmaxrees> what was it?
[20:29:44] <Darmani> see this line here https://gist.github.com/mfifth/e59409b648e224dc8433f2a325ffba6f#file-ajax_call-js-L14
[20:29:57] <Darmani> By the time this gets called the data is already on the page.
[20:30:10] <Darmani> I'm altering the data not the actual page.
[20:30:28] <robertmaxrees> what were you console logging before?
[20:30:51] <Darmani> We were logging this console.log($(data).find("#event_start_date_time").val());
[20:31:01] <robertmaxrees> right. that should be from the data.
[20:31:07] <Darmani> right
[20:31:23] <robertmaxrees> confused but alright!
[20:31:24] <Darmani> But we are altering the data
[20:31:26] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/e59409b648e224dc8433f2a325ffba6f#file-ajax_call-js-L16
[20:31:40] <Darmani> The data is already on the page here https://gist.github.com/mfifth/e59409b648e224dc8433f2a325ffba6f#file-ajax_call-js-L14
[20:32:16] <robertmaxrees> right, but the alteration and retrieval should've been against the data.  although i just realized why that part wasn't working.
[20:32:45] <Darmani> We are already setting the data on the page though
[20:32:51] <Darmani> before we even check it
[20:33:00] <robertmaxrees>  $(data).find("#event_start_date_time").val("") is spitting out a new jquery-fied data that's getting messed with each time.
[20:33:07] <robertmaxrees> you setting it on the page has no bearing with those lines.
[20:33:09] <robertmaxrees> that's my point.
[20:33:26] <Darmani> Well it works
[20:33:27] <Darmani> wat...
[20:33:29] <Darmani> but now I'm confused lol
[20:33:35] <robertmaxrees> what did you change?
[20:34:03] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/e59409b648e224dc8433f2a325ffba6f#file-ajax_call-js
[20:34:11] <robertmaxrees> right.
[20:34:15] <robertmaxrees> so now you're looking at the actual page.
[20:34:19] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/mfifth/e59409b648e224dc8433f2a325ffba6f#file-ajax_call-js-L15
[20:34:24] <robertmaxrees> $(data) was creating a new jquery object each time.
[20:34:29] <Darmani> yeah
[20:34:38] <Darmani> ohhh
[20:34:47] <robertmaxrees> so when you were setting and retrieving it, you were doing it against a new version each time.
[20:35:07] <robertmaxrees> so var $data = $(data) then using $data instead would've resolved that get/set issue.
[20:35:28] <Darmani> ohh
[20:35:32] <Darmani> What's the $ symbol for?
[20:35:45] <robertmaxrees> just to denote it's a jquery object.
[20:35:50] <robertmaxrees> nothing special.
[20:35:53] <robertmaxrees> just a naming convention.
[20:36:09] <Darmani> Well either way thank you. I wouldn't have gotten this far without bouncing ideas off someone :)
[20:36:14] <robertmaxrees> yeah def.
[20:36:43] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: I really owe you a beer or something
[20:36:47] <Darmani> I just don't know where to send it
[20:36:52] <robertmaxrees> hah.  don't worry about it.
[20:36:53] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[20:37:07] <Darmani> I need to send you something dude.
[20:37:12] <Darmani> seriously
[20:37:17] <Darmani> a box of cookies
[20:37:21] <Darmani> a pack of condoms
[20:37:22] <Darmani> something
[20:37:25] <jak2000> robertmaxrees i wait
[20:37:34] <jak2000> return a 2 (2 rows)
[20:37:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:38:48] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/dtn43f57/  why the length is 1?
[20:39:12] <robertmaxrees> there's only one element with that ID.....
[20:39:32] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting it to be?
[20:40:06] <jak2000> i expect, return 2 (2rows) but i understand now
[20:40:20] <robertmaxrees> 2 rows?
[20:40:24] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[20:44:38] <skypce> i have a dropdown menu, when i hover over it , it loads a class, how can i detect when the class is present?
[20:46:24] <robertmaxrees> skypce kind of a strange questiopn.
[20:46:41] <robertmaxrees> why not just stick logic after you add it?
[20:51:09] <jak2000> robertmaxrees, https://github.com/markcell/jquery-tabledit/blob/master/jquery.tabledit.js#L372 can you see?
[20:51:15] <jak2000> understand te code?
[20:51:17] <jak2000> :)
[20:51:17] <robertmaxrees> ?
[20:51:22] <robertmaxrees> what's your question?
[20:53:21] <robertmaxrees> jak2000
[20:54:09] <jak2000> the code of this plugin is of: http://markcell.github.io/jquery-tabledit/#examples
[20:54:13] <jak2000> see example #6
[20:54:42] <jak2000> my question is, how to validate, the values of a input... i want validate, if is a Date or Number how to? (i think need modify the plugin)
[20:55:04] <robertmaxrees> never modify a plugin.
[20:55:25] <robertmaxrees> you want to validate inputs?
[20:55:49] <robertmaxrees> use html5 validation.  might have to bake in some minor stuff to prevent submission and whatnot.
[20:56:04] <skypce> i need watch if display is none or block, or if a class sfHover is added to menu
[20:56:08] <skypce> https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/wiki/Check-If-An-Element-Is-Hidden-Using-JQuery
[20:56:14] <skypce> i found this but do not work
[20:56:44] <jak2000> but the inputs (if you test the example#6 havent a name or id
[20:56:46] <jak2000> is a generic..
[20:58:40] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 so you don't generate the html yourself?
[20:58:43] <robertmaxrees> then try jquery validate.
[20:58:48] <robertmaxrees> or any of a number of validators.
[20:58:53] <jak2000> i generate
[20:59:06] <robertmaxrees> skypce right so monitoring for that's kind of a strrange thing to want to do.
[20:59:09] <jak2000> thehtml table... but when user press Edit button
[20:59:17] <jak2000> the plugin genrate the controls.
[20:59:43] <skypce> robertmaxrees, i want change color the header element when superfish menu has the clas sfhover
[21:01:47] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 then you may need another plugin or just use something like jquery valkidate.
[21:02:43] <robertmaxrees> skypce link to the plugin's docs?
[21:04:46] <robertmaxrees> skypce is it http://users.tpg.com.au/j_birch/plugins/superfish/options/?
[21:09:47] <robertmaxrees> welp
[21:14:44] <skypce> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/7gnkuwo9/
[21:15:00] <skypce> i am thinking simple mode
[21:15:02] <skypce> but do not work
[21:15:08] <robertmaxrees> err.
[21:15:19] <robertmaxrees> they give you callbacks duder
[21:15:37] <robertmaxrees> did i linkt he correct docs?
[21:16:42] <skypce> yes, nothing util
[21:17:05] <robertmaxrees> so you want to respond to when you hover on something?
[21:17:22] <robertmaxrees> and onBeforeShow isn't it?
[21:17:26] <skypce> onchange on hover , bind
[21:17:32] <skypce> i was searching a lot
[21:17:35] <skypce> nothing works
[21:17:44] <robertmaxrees> http://users.tpg.com.au/j_birch/plugins/superfish/options/?
[21:17:45] <robertmaxrees> from here
[21:17:48] <robertmaxrees> not jquery event bindings.
[21:18:03] <robertmaxrees> the documents have a ton of available callbacks, so i'd guess one of these might bne what you want.
[21:18:10] <robertmaxrees> if not, feel free to make a fiddle and we can help.
[21:19:43] <skypce> ok thank you
[21:46:33] <skypce> i have a class what change width from 1px to 800px
[21:46:57] <skypce> it is possible add a class when the class change to 800 px
[21:47:00] <skypce> not media querie
[21:47:06] <skypce> only the width of the div
[21:47:13] <skypce> media query
[21:50:06] <skypce> exist some like : length >= 800 ?
[21:51:36] <skypce> i will test with trigger
[21:52:00] <skypce> when .sfHover is present trigger a class in header
[21:52:04] <skypce> ahahah
[23:26:57] <madprops> how efficient is $('.someclass').length() ?
[23:27:21] <madprops> would it be a bad idea to do it very often if there are thousands of elements with that class?
[23:28:33] <rhizome> what are you trying to do? just operate on the array that's returned
[23:28:42] <WhirledPress> every time you use $('.selector') it querys to DOM, It is better to cache the query then the length is static
[23:29:15] <rhizome> you can guard the whole thing with if $('.foo') but that should be about all you have to worry about
[23:37:17] <WhirledPress> rhizome, but doesn't if($(".foo") return true regardless of if $('.foo').length==0 ? in fact, to verify you have something in your jQuery object, don't you have to use if ($('.foo').length) ?
