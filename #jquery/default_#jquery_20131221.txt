[01:28:10] <themanguy> hello, im trying to make a popup box which jquery then fades the background and there will be an x in the popup to close it, however its not working for the close button.

[03:59:39] <Rashad> Hello.
[04:01:09] <pagemaster> Hey
[04:02:08] <Rashad> I have the following problem: I am using .load() and it is freezing my page.
[04:02:17] <Rashad> In the past it didn't.
[04:02:48] <Rashad> When I tested locally it didn't.
[04:05:09] <Rashad> And I have this line: $('button').html('Wait...'); that should execute before the .load();, but it isn't.
[04:06:04] <Rashad> It once executed and showed the "Wait..." text, but only once.
[04:07:31] <krambiorix> hi, i want to get the number of divs with class container that have a child div with class account. How can i do that?
[04:59:06] <FutureTense> any idea why jQuery isn't loading when using ~/ in the path?  (example) http://bpaste.net/show/6RyT6zHvmjf694O5WBYq/
[04:59:52] <grr_> not a valid path in browserland?
[05:01:37] <FutureTense> the 2nd one works
[05:01:45] <FutureTense> and the page is at the root
[05:02:19] <Velveeta> the root of the site, or the root of the url?
[05:02:59] <grr_> hi there Velveeta
[05:03:02] <grr_> <-- grafi :P
[05:03:13] <Velveeta> hello hello
[05:03:21] <FutureTense> root of the site
[05:03:38] <FutureTense> so the page and "Scripts" are at the same level
[05:04:00] <Velveeta> gotcha, so it's like: www.domain.com/page.html or something
[05:05:17] <FutureTense> yes
[05:14:54] <beingjohnm> anybody have any experience using dozens or hundreds of date pickers on a page? It takes about 30 seconds for my page to load with about 200 of them. Looking for any optimization tips anybody can offer.

[05:50:56] <Ericx2x> Hey guys,
[05:51:01] <Ericx2x> what exactly is Node.JS
[05:51:17] <Ericx2x> like what is it used for
[05:51:22] <Ericx2x> why is it so popular?
[05:54:22] <otherj> it's server side javascript
[05:54:34] <otherj> it's popular because it's fast, has good package management and pretty easy to write
[05:54:39] <otherj> npm = good stuff
[06:00:28] <otherj> joroci, i ended up going with .on() and observing for input
[06:00:41] <otherj> joroci, easier than actually coding for if it's changed or not
[06:01:50] <grr_> exit
[06:05:41] <bigbugjava> Hi there, all I want to do is to pass  <input id="file" name="file" type="file"> Path! to node.js as a string, to use for a key, how can I manage to do that?
[06:15:35] <dekiss> if (eve.target.parentNode.parentNode.offsetLeft < -900) { return 0; }
[06:18:34] <joroci> and :)
[06:54:39] <dekiss> I have 3 images and one is clicked it needs to be moved with animate and others need to fade with opacity
[06:54:43] <dekiss> how can I do this?
[06:55:00] <dekiss> they all get opacity 0
[06:55:08] <dekiss> I need the clicked to stay with opacity 1
[06:56:12] <Kambfhase> .not(this)
[06:56:22] <dekiss> alert($(eve2.target.className));
[06:56:27] <dekiss> eve2 is event
[06:56:30] <dekiss> can I do this
[06:56:38] <dekiss> Kambfhase thanks I will try this now :)
[06:56:40] <dekiss> thanks
[06:57:12] <dekiss> Kambfhase what you think about second question can I do that?
[06:57:43] <dekiss> whatever I put after eve2 or just eve2 I get object
[06:57:44] <dekiss> :S
[06:57:46] <Kambfhase> err, no. that wont give you the ecpectet result.
[06:58:14] <dekiss> ok I understand
[06:58:21] <dekiss> var aaa=($(eve2.target.nodeType));
[06:58:26] <dekiss> in aaa is still oibject
[06:58:28] <dekiss> hm
[06:58:30] <dekiss> ok
[06:59:20] <dekiss> $(aaa.parentNode.parentNode); can i do this if in aaa I have reference to element?
[06:59:26] <dekiss> Kambfhase ^
[06:59:51] <Kambfhase> $(whatever) will always be a jquery object
[07:00:06] <dekiss> yes I can it seems
[07:00:09] <dekiss> ok
[07:00:17] <dekiss> no I ment about the selector is it valid?
[07:00:27] <dekiss>  $(aaa.parentNode.parentNode);
[07:00:42] <Kambfhase> yeah, that is fine
[07:02:18] <dekiss> Kambfhase thanks for helping me
[07:02:22] <Kambfhase> np
[07:02:34] <dekiss> https://soundcloud.com/twilliamsmusic/sets/t-williams-in-new-djs-we-1 enjoy :)
[07:06:55] <dekiss> Kambfhase is this valid? $(aaa.parentNode.parentNode).animate({ left: $("#img_cont")-100  }, 800)
[07:07:16] <dekiss> ah wait
[07:07:26] <Kambfhase> $("#img_cont")-100 << you subtract 100 from an object?
[07:07:28] <dekiss>  left: $("#img_cont").offsetLeft-100
[07:07:34] <dekiss> ye :) I had mistake
[07:07:34] <dekiss> now?
[07:07:50] <Kambfhase> $("#img_cont").offsetLeft is a function
[07:09:01] <Kambfhase> err, there is no offsetLeft
[07:09:40] <Kambfhase> go for $('#img_cont').offset().left
[07:09:41] <dekiss> ahh
[07:09:55] <dekiss> yeah thanks Kambfhase :) I just googeld that
[07:10:00] <dekiss> lets try,,
[07:10:25] <dekiss> left: $(this).offset().left-100
[07:10:29] <dekiss> this cant aww
[07:11:38] <dekiss> Kambfhase how can i do this for the element clicked? $('#img_cont').offset().left
[07:11:43] <dekiss> instead #img_cont
[07:11:54] <Kambfhase> $(this).offset().left
[07:12:15] <dekiss> hm
[07:12:21] <dekiss> yeh thanks Kambfhase
[07:12:28] <dekiss> I am finding solution to my problem hmm :)
[07:13:48] <dekiss> can';t find solution to my scenario :S
[07:14:08] <dekiss> I have 3 divs all have diferent ffsets left I need to move them when clicked all in same position :S
[07:15:18] <dekiss> I take their parent offset left and adding 700 but nothing :S
[07:15:22] <dekiss>     left: $(aaa.parentNode.parentNode.parentNode).offset().left-700
[07:15:29] <dekiss> they still move at different positions
[07:16:35] <dekiss> yeeeeeee
[07:16:40] <dekiss> Kambfhase I solved it :) thanks!
[07:16:48] <Kambfhase> np
[07:18:37] <dekiss> Kambfhase should I use position() or offset() ?
[07:18:58] <dekiss> if I use offset() I think if anything in the document html structure changes then I will have problems
[07:19:02] <dekiss> no?
[07:19:29] <Kambfhase> That depends on the effect you want to achieve.
[07:19:36] <Kambfhase> from the docs: The .offset() method allows us to retrieve the current position of an element relative to the document. Contrast this with .position(), which retrieves the current position relative to the offset parent.
[07:21:08] <dekiss> how can I change size of element - width and height, so it preservers width height ratio?
[07:21:12] <dekiss> can I do this ?
[07:21:32] <dekiss> Kambfhase yeah I though and I used position it is better for my scenario
[07:21:40] <mikunos> hi guys I need to update the order div with the result of an ajax call like this: http://jsfiddle.net/th6bL/
[07:21:54] <dekiss> wait
[07:21:56] <dekiss> i wil lgoogle a bit
[07:21:59] <dekiss> sorry for bothering so much
[07:22:04] <dekiss> I should invesigate more :S
[07:22:05] <Kambfhase> var h = e.height(), w = e.width(), r = 1.2; e.height(h*r); e.width(w*r);
[07:22:10] <mikunos> I don't understand what have I to set in the success event
[07:22:13] <dekiss> Kambfhase thanks
[07:22:23] <mikunos> is  $(this).html(data); correct?
[07:22:39] <mikunos> data is a plain html
[07:23:05] <dekiss> Kambfhase what you think if I use percentage for the element's css height? ^^
[07:23:29] <Kambfhase> mikunos: nope, that line is wrong
[07:23:29] <dekiss> it will be percentage of it's width, so if width changes height will to with same ratio?
[07:23:31] <dekiss> yeah
[07:23:44] <dekiss> I think this might be very very simple solution?
[07:23:46] <dekiss> and effective
[07:23:53] <mikunos> Kambfhase why?
[07:23:55] <Kambfhase> mikunos: JS has lexical binding.
[07:24:09] <Kambfhase> you ne to save `this`  for later
[07:24:59] <Kambfhase> mikunos: http://jsfiddle.net/th6bL/1/
[07:27:52] <mikunos> let me test it
[07:29:19] <mikunos> Kambfhase thanks
[07:29:23] <mikunos> it works
[07:29:25] <Kambfhase> :)
[07:29:28] <mikunos> thanks again
[07:31:35] <otherj> does query have some kind of function that gives me the equiv of window.location.href but with a "relative" url? by which i mean //hostname/blah.html
[07:32:53] <dekiss> <Kambfhase> var h = e.height(), w = e.width(), r = 1.2; e.height(h*r); e.width(w*r);
[07:32:59] <dekiss> I don;t understand this ^ :S
[07:33:11] <dekiss> e.height(h*r) this :S
[07:33:54] <Kambfhase> dekiss: rtfm: http://api.jquery.com/height/#height2
[07:35:45] <Kambfhase> otherj: there is not only location.href but many more properties: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location
[07:36:00] <otherj> yeah, i mean, i can do it in pure js
[07:36:10] <otherj> just wondering if query had a shortcut that was "convention"
[07:36:12] <otherj> thanks
[07:36:35] <Kambfhase> no, there is no jQ method for that afaik
[07:51:53] <bobz_zg> anyone can help pls, I want to populate select fields choices from object, but I get it as a string in one option instead of each returned as option http://pastebin.com/MGqdUJDK

[08:15:28] <basil_kurian_> i got 10 records in db. For every record , there will be form in a page. That is 10 forms with input values of same name(generated with a for loop)
[08:16:00] <basil_kurian_> how can i identify 'change' even of one of the input value in a particular form
[08:16:07] <basil_kurian_> **change event
[08:16:50] <basil_kurian_> if I do   $('#monitoring').change(function() , it won't work
[08:17:13] <basil_kurian_> because the input 'monitoring' is present in multiple forms within the page
[08:29:13] <Kambfhase> ?id
[08:30:17] <Kambfhase> basil_kurian_: an ID needs to be unique on the page. if you have multiple elements with the ID #monitoring jQuery will not work correctly!
[08:31:55] <basil_kurian_> so , what is the best method to generate form for every record in one page
[08:32:31] <basil_kurian_> Kambfhase: you have any handy links ?
[08:32:47] <Kambfhase> use classes
[08:33:40] <Kambfhase> $('#form1 input.monitoring').whatEver()
[09:54:30] <bumbar> i have a form where user can add fields on the fly, and would like for jquery autocomplete to work on those. Hopefully code shows what i want, https://dpaste.de/f6gr
[10:02:04] <joroci> so add it after the user adds the input
[10:08:05] <Whiskey> :P
[10:14:35] <mikunos> is there a way to use 2 classes to duplicate the action?
[10:14:53] <grafi> oO
[10:14:56] <RRR2> wat
[10:15:09] <mikunos> :)
[10:16:27] <grafi> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43313739/_/21MvUpw.gif
[10:23:14] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/7Qjzz/40/ <--- in my firefox i can do ctrl-a why?
[10:24:04] <grafi> i cant even focus the output window
[10:24:13] <Whiskey> also in ie chrome, but everything else works
[10:27:01] <Whiskey> thats strange
[10:28:10] <mikunos> I am trying to create a simple widget panel items and I need to refresh every single widget. I need to add a reload icon close the header in order to update the content of the little widget
[10:28:15] <mikunos> http://jsfiddle.net/th6bL/
[10:28:43] <mikunos>  $('.reload').on('click', function () {...}); doesn't work
[10:28:57] <mikunos> but If I use the firebug it works as well
[10:29:01] <daivyk> hi, i am selecting all my option with $("#id > option").each(function(i) {...}, but inside i am doing $(this).value and i am getting undefined, $(this) is not undefined.
[10:30:18] <Whiskey> is it jQuery thats not working
[10:31:22] <mikunos> any help?
[10:31:46] <lianzinho> mikunos: didn't understand your problemâ€¦ your fiddle works?
[10:32:18] <mikunos> lianzinho unfortunatelly not
[10:32:55] <mikunos> lianzinho I need to execute the reload of the ajax by a click on a icon
[10:32:58] <lianzinho> mikunos: that's because you are trying to make an ajax call to a inexistent url
[10:33:12] <mikunos> the ajax call works
[10:33:12] <Kambfhase> daivyk: try $(this).val()
[10:33:25] <mikunos> I don't understand why the click event doesn't fire
[10:33:30] <daivyk> Kambfhase: ok
[10:33:43] <lianzinho> mikunos: how can I fire the ajax and see it working here?
[10:33:48] <lianzinho> in jsfiddle
[10:34:00] <mikunos> you cannot see the result
[10:34:12] <mikunos> because there is a custom html
[10:37:27] <mikunos> lianzinho http://jsfiddle.net/p489e/4/
[10:37:30] <mikunos> look now
[10:37:46] <mikunos> there is a right icon
[10:37:55] <mikunos> to reload the content of the widget
[10:38:04] <mikunos> in fiddle works
[10:39:59] <lianzinho> not clickable here
[10:40:21] <mikunos> it's the same also in my project
[10:40:31] <mikunos> it is not clickable
[10:40:40] <mikunos> and I don't understand why
[10:40:51] <lianzinho> I guess it's more a CSS problem than JS not?
[10:41:08] <mikunos> css?
[10:43:51] <lianzinho> mikunos
[10:44:00] <lianzinho> theres a button in front of it
[10:44:00] <mikunos> lianzinho
[10:44:06] <mikunos> ?
[10:44:08] <lianzinho> that does not allow you to click in the right icon
[10:44:10] <mikunos> button?
[10:44:13] <lianzinho> yes
[10:44:24] <mikunos> fiddle button?
[10:45:09] <mikunos> try now
[10:45:11] <mikunos> http://jsfiddle.net/p489e/5/
[10:45:12] <lianzinho> mikunos: are you seeing a span tag
[10:45:19] <lianzinho> written RESULT ?
[10:45:24] <mikunos> yes I have moved down
[10:45:33] <lianzinho> now it works
[10:45:34] <lianzinho> hehehe
[10:45:38] <lianzinho> click your icon
[10:45:45] <mikunos> not in my project :(
[10:46:50] <lianzinho> put a console.log("clicked"); after the createWidget...
[10:46:58] <lianzinho> see if its being really clicked
[10:47:40] <lianzinho> I guess your problem is simply the mouse not being able to reach the button
[10:48:18] <lianzinho> chance the css of it to cursor: pointer, so you'll and the user will be sure that it is over a clickcable element
[10:59:36] <dekiss2> what is wrong here   document.getElementById("player_container").style.transform="rotate(37deg)";

[12:09:36] <paxcoder> s/At the/On the API page/
[12:25:58] <dekiss2> I am using jquery to animate, I animate and move one div over another the first has z index of 99999 and other has z index of 9999, what happens is first while in animation I see the first div below the other, and then over some time everything is ok, first div is above another
[12:43:58] <NBhosting> why is users empty https://dpaste.de/ysqE
[12:44:32] <NBhosting> userstaus runs alot of time, users is online filled after the push, so i can check it it already exist in users
[13:09:29] <darkfrog> if I have selectorA and selectorB and I want to determine if selectorA contains the elements in selectorB how do I check that?
[13:10:53] <Velveeta> the elements *in* selectorB, like its children?
[13:11:17] <hugo_moss> http://api.jquery.com/has/
[13:11:59] <darkfrog> Velveeta: no, I mean if selectorA has #one, #two, and #three and selectorB has #two and #three I want to evaluate true
[13:12:09] <hugo_moss> $( "li" ).has( "ul" ).css( "background-color", "red" );
[13:12:26] <darkfrog> hugo_moss: that is not what I want
[13:15:02] <Velveeta> darkfrog: so you want to know if a substring of selectorA contains a substring of selectorB?
[13:15:31] <darkfrog> essentially
[13:18:06] <Velveeta> well, you could split both selectors on commas, and loop through selectorB's indexes and see if they're in the array of selectorA indexes
[13:19:10] <hugo_moss> yea
[13:20:45] <darkfrog> I just assumed there'd be a built-in function for this
[13:20:50] <hugo_moss> anyone here use the lazy load plugin by mikaa tuupola?
[13:21:23] <Velveeta> darkfrog: what you're talking about isn't really jquery functionality.. just because you're comparing selector contents doesn't make it something jquery should have a built in function for.. you're just doing string comparisons
[13:21:55] <darkfrog> Velveeta: it's NOT string comparisons, it's element comparisons
[13:21:59] <Velveeta> now if you want jquery to do it, you totally can
[13:22:24] <Velveeta> well by making it hash tag selectors, it gets reduced to string comparisons, because you're dealing with id selectors, which are supposed to be unique
[13:22:32] <Velveeta> so you can save the overhead of parsing the document, and just parse the string instead
[13:22:53] <Velveeta> if you want jquery to handle it, then you can do something like this: <whipping up an example>
[13:23:01] <dekiss> how can I fade out all children of a parent of the element I am clicking except that element that I am clicking?
[13:23:37] <darkfrog> Velveeta: your assertion is incorrect...it's not like jQuery doesn't already do similar things like jQuery.is
[13:23:40] <jphase> dekiss: $(this).children().fadeOut();    -   or .animate() depending on how specific you want to get with the transition
[13:24:44] <Velveeta> it's really not an incorrect assertion, i'm telling you that id selector comparisons can, because of the nature of the fact that they're supposed to be unique, be reduced to a string comparison and save yourself the overhead of dom parsing
[13:24:48] <Velveeta> that much is true
[13:24:54] <Velveeta> but like i said, you can still have jquery do it
[13:25:11] <darkfrog> Velveeta: that's presuming the elements actually have ids, there's no guarantee that is true
[13:25:40] <Velveeta> well, when you have a selectorA and B example of #one, #two, and #three, those are id selectors, so yes, my assumption was that the elements would actually have id's
[13:26:27] <darkfrog> Velveeta: that was an example.
[13:26:46] <darkfrog> Velveeta: it could just as easily be $('.someclass') and $('.anotherclass')
[13:26:47] <Velveeta> right, and i'm currently whipping you up a code example to demonstrate how to do it with jquery, if you can wait 30 seconds
[13:27:05] <darkfrog> as far as I can see, the easiest way to accomplish it would be with filter
[13:27:38] <darkfrog> if (selectorA.filter(selectorB).length == selectorB.length) { // 'contains'
[13:30:15] <Velveeta> and yeah, that's about the way i'd do it
[13:30:19] <Velveeta> http://jsbin.com/otifUGU/1/edit
[13:31:02] <Velveeta> there's a .has() function also, but it will return true if the 1st set contains *any* of the 2nd set
[13:31:25] <Velveeta> so your filter example should do what you're looking for, which i'm guessing is to verify it contains *everything* in the 2nd set
[13:31:44] <darkfrog> Velveeta: I think you need to re-read the docs on 'has'
[13:32:20] <Velveeta> and why is that?
[13:32:44] <darkfrog> Velveeta: because 'has' doesn't return a boolean: Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element.
[13:33:16] <darkfrog> it's for hierarchical evaluation
[13:33:27] <Velveeta> right, but you can just tack on a .length to turn it into a truthy or falsy evaluation
[13:33:49] <darkfrog> Velveeta: I'm not looking for descendants
[13:34:12] <Velveeta> oh yeah i get what you're saying
[13:34:29] <darkfrog> Velveeta: it isn't clear if same depth items would be included, but even if they were I could very likely get false positives as a result
[13:34:45] <Velveeta> i don't think same depth would be included w/ has, you're right
[13:35:40] <Velveeta> there's a closest() function for same depth or higher, but i don't think there's an equivalent for same depth or lower
[13:36:14] <darkfrog> crap
[13:36:26] <darkfrog> jQuery.is does exactly that
[13:36:26] <Velveeta> but the filter method should work just fine
[13:36:48] <Velveeta> jquery.is isn't same depth or lower, it's just a straight comparison against another dom node or selector
[14:59:52] <scanlonman> Hey everyone!  I'm currently dynamically creating some divs with javascript and was curious how I could call a method on them
[15:00:08] <scanlonman> $(".classname").method(blahblah) is not working for the dynamically created divs
[15:00:42] <razzi> scanlonman, check out .on()
[15:01:05] <scanlonman> I checked out on but my reading comprehension may be failing.  It looks like on() only works on events like click
[15:01:57] <scanlonman> Or is there an event for when a div is created?
[15:04:54] <scanlonman> and I'm dumb and just figured it out... thank you for the help!
[15:12:28] <ZzaichikK> I need some help - I'm trying to hide/show an element depending on whether or they are scrolling up or down.  http://jsfiddle.net/ZzaichikK/7Bu98/2/  But when scrolling up, the value always resets.
[15:12:34] <ZzaichikK> why?
[15:19:07] <ZzaichikK> http://jsfiddle.net/ZzaichikK/7Bu98/3/
[15:25:33] <Kambfhase> ZzaichikK: http://jsfiddle.net/7Bu98/4/
[15:26:13] <ZzaichikK> haha awesome. overthinking it apparenlty.

[15:53:30] <dekiss> jphase thanks
[15:53:44] <dekiss> how can I fade out all children of a parent of the element I am clicking except that element that I am clicking?
[16:01:27] <dekiss> what is wrong here $("#img_cont > div")[ii].fadeOut();
[16:05:56] <shoky> dekiss:  you probably want .eq(ii)  instead of [ii]
[16:06:38] <dekiss> shoky
[16:06:44] <dekiss> what is that :S
[16:07:26] <shoky> dekiss:  [ii] will get the native DOMElement object,  .eq(ii) will return it wrapped in a jquery object. you can only call .fadeOut() on jquery objects
[16:07:34] <shoky> `api eq
[16:07:38] <b-ot> shoky: .eq(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[16:08:32] <dekiss> fadeOut makes display:none?
[16:08:42] <dekiss> shoky thanks that did it but now I face another peoblem :S
[16:08:51] <shoky> when the animation ends, yeah i think
[16:09:10] <dekiss> hm now its ok
[16:09:11] <dekiss> weird
[16:09:16] <dekiss> shoky thanks
[16:09:31] <dekiss> ah yeye
[16:09:38] <dekiss> ahhh
[16:09:40] <dekiss> :S
[16:09:56] <dekiss> how to fadeOut wuthout display:none any idea? I must animate opacity?
[16:10:05] <shoky> `api fadeTo
[16:10:05] <b-ot> shoky: .fadeTo(): Adjust the opacity of the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/fadeTo/
[16:23:05] <dekiss> shoky I am very confused with stopPropagation :S
[16:23:33] <dekiss> when I click img his parents get the click event 2 times?
[16:26:16] <dekiss> I have made if so I assign to click=1 if element is clicked and click=0 if it is bot clicked, so I do different things based on this condition. I click the element once but code in the two conditions execute. why?
[16:35:07] <HQRaja> Hello. I have 9 divs that are all direct children of one container div. I want a function to be performed each time any of those divs is clicked, but what it will perform will depend on which div was clicked. What would be the best way to do that? (Beginner here)
[16:38:39] <HQRaja> Anyone?
[16:42:02] <dekiss> if I do save1=$(aaa.parentNode.parentNode.parentNode).position().left; is this live, if element position().left changes, the value in the var will change?
[17:01:05] <shoky> dekiss: no it's not live
[17:02:37] <shoky> HQRaja: event delegation with .on()  e.g.  $('#container').on('click', 'div.myclass', function(e) {  console.log(this); })
[17:06:58] <HQRaja> shoky: Thanks. What is the 'div.myclass' part here?
[17:08:07] <HQRaja> shoky: And also, the 'e' argument
[17:16:56] <yellow> hi everyone !
[17:44:40] <Siecje> I'm trying to create a inline edit form, but I am quering by looking for the id to start with a string http://jsfiddle.net/nHnsY/3/
[17:45:09] <Siecje> I would like to be able to double click on a 'skill' edit it and hit enter to submit the form
[17:45:33] <Siecje> right now when I double click it 'opens' multiple forms
[17:54:02] <shoky> HQRaja:  div.myclass is the selector to use for the items you want to catch clicks on
[17:54:19] <shoky> HQRaja: the 'e' argument is the event object, sometimes useful
[17:56:02] <HQRaja> shoky: Oh OK. And inside the code, what would I use to refer to the item that caught the click? this?
[17:59:51] <ZzaichikK> ^ yeah
[18:00:03] <HQRaja> Thanks
[18:00:10] <ZzaichikK> $(this)
[18:09:37] <inthl> I want to catch every form submission by $("form").submit(function (event) { ... } - but only those which are of type POST, not GET - how would one define that...? this example captures both
[18:15:35] <andrew_r> inthl: I'd probably put a class on the form elements you want to capture
[18:16:32] <inthl> well I want to capture all possible forms
[18:16:48] <inthl> there are a lot, this is why I use "form" instead ".someclass, someclass2..."
[18:17:10] <andrew_r> you could probably do something like if($(this).attr('method') == 'get') { return true; } inside your submit handler
[18:17:42] <andrew_r> if you can give the same class to all your forms that you want to capture, then you could attach events only to those forms with one simple selector
[18:18:43] <andrew_r> either option would be OK I guess, but if you are able to, I would add a "captureForm" class to every form you want to capture
[18:18:46] <inthl> well yes, but currently I'd rather not touch the form's classes. however, thank you - I was looking excactly for that, didn't know about .attr('method')
[18:18:52] <HQRaja> shoky: OK I have tried for quite a while, but can't seem to get it to work. Can you please take a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/hCFwr/2/
[18:20:44] <andrew_r> HQRaja: you have to wrap this with jQuery. Change this.toggleClass('clicked'); to $(this).toggleClass('clicked');
[18:21:15] <andrew_r> this = the dom element (no jquery wrapper)
[18:21:29] <HQRaja> andrew_r: Ah, I see. Thanks...that worked like a charm! =)
[18:22:24] <HQRaja> Now one more thing...how do I get the ID of 'this' (what was clicked) in text form?
[18:22:41] <shoky> this.id
[18:22:49] <HQRaja> Awesome :)
[18:22:54] <HQRaja> Thanks again
[18:34:42] <NBhosting> anyone here?

[19:57:37] <Hypers> not fast but past*
[19:59:06] <GoSox> I am getting some really bazar behavior on a page. Only in IE9 and IE10 of course. When you type a number into the pages' one input field, and hit return, IE browsers send you do a different page. Which makes no sense to me at all.
[19:59:12] <GoSox> this is the page: http://www.whatsmyip.org/port-scanner/
[19:59:52] <GoSox> if you type, say 80 into the custom port test and hit return, IE will send you to the server port test, as if you had clicked the scan button up there
[19:59:57] <GoSox> it makes no sense to me at all

[21:23:17] <ricomoss> Can anyone direct me to some code examples of how to use the Twitter API with jquery?  Especially the Oauth handling.
[21:44:19] <sun> Heya :) Does anyone know what the fate of the jquery.cookie library is?  It's included in jQuery UI now and Drupal 8 leverages that.  But will it stay that way?
[21:47:56] <sun> sorry, wrong channel, I guess
[22:26:50] <jphase> sun: I don't think the jQuery cookie plugin is included with UI but it's often used to save the active state of tabs and such. Perhaps Drupal includes them both. I doubt jquery.cookie is going anywhere anytime soon though.
[22:30:20] <sun> jphase: Thanks for the pointer!  I just noticed that it doesn't appear to be contained anymore; https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/master/external -- but it's also possible that I'm completely mistaken and it was never really included (in 1.10.2 ?)
[22:31:38] <sun> ah-ha, it actually was removed: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/0429532ad10b0708e085c4830bb930d8457d62f4
[22:36:12] <sun> hm. http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7162 - Apparently, no description or backstory, scott_gonzalez simply removed it?
[22:37:32] <sun> sorry, I missed the issue reference to the meta issue, http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7144
[22:37:51] <sun> ok, I think that makes sense now
[22:39:30] <jphase> yeah I thought I remembered a cookie option
[22:39:58] <jphase> haven't been using UI much for awhile
[22:40:19] <sun> Although not sure how to port our existing and already-converted code, since the jquery.cookie() in UI had a different API than the original https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie/blob/master/jquery.cookie.js
[22:42:42] <sun> But yeah, that's essentially the answer I looked for :)  Now I can create an issue for JS folks in Drupal core to figure this out :-D
[22:43:20] <greg5green> less convenient, but cookies arent terribly complicated
[22:43:30] <greg5green> if you're worried about dependencies, just roll your own real quick
[22:45:00] <sun> yeah, it looks like we could simply restore the deleted file from jquery-ui's repo and include it in Drupal core -- but then again, it might be safer to bet on the original jquery-cookie library
[22:46:17] <greg5green> i meant to eschew the $.cookie from your life
[22:46:20] <greg5green> its only 114 lines
[22:46:28] <greg5green> document.cookie is relatively easy to work with
[22:46:58] <greg5green> including it yourself defintely works too though and doesnt require rewriting anything
[22:47:36] <greg5green> also, i dont trust the ppl who wrote $.cookie
[22:47:40] <greg5green> they use 8 space soft tabs...
[22:47:42] <greg5green> :)
[22:47:45] <jphase> haha
[22:48:00] <jphase> agreed on that "choice"
[22:51:08] <sun> oh. Indeed, the UI plugin doesn't actually do that much.  Still some scaffolding for a better developer experience, but in the end, you make a good point there :)
[22:55:42] <jphase> well I'm all about not re-inventing the wheel, but 8 space soft tabs is a syntax choice I'm not sure I can respect
[22:55:43] <jphase> hehe
[22:56:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> quick question is there anyway to set
[22:56:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> well let me explain from the start
[22:56:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> I have a table
[22:56:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> that is sortable
[22:56:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> using jquery ui
[22:57:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> is there a way to make a table sortable
[22:57:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> only if cell is from the first row
[22:57:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> only catch is that my table uses columns
[22:57:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> instead of rows
[22:58:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> and that too the "cells"
[22:58:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> are really divs whcih have display: cell
[22:58:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> table-cell
[22:59:03] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: you can use sortable on most elements yeah. whip up a jsfiddle if there's issues, kinda hard to get the context.
[22:59:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> right o
[22:59:33] <jphase> but generally speaking you can ignore elements based on a selector and do some fairly finite stuff with it
[23:00:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> here you go
[23:00:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/S5D5G/
[23:00:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> well what i want to do
[23:00:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> is make it sortable
[23:00:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> only when you click and drag the first cell
[23:00:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> so what i really wnat to know
[23:01:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> or what i should use
[23:01:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> is activate event
[23:01:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then what options can i grab from the event
[23:01:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> arguement
[23:01:45] <jphase> well you'll need some other <div class="table"> elements that are contained in a parent element to have this work
[23:02:02] <jphase> since .table is your sortable selector, it's going to make this sortable based on .table's parent
[23:02:26] <jphase> er... .table as a parent rather
[23:02:56] <jphase> what in this table are you needing to sort? the columns or the rows?
[23:03:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> thats the body then
[23:03:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> interesting that the demo doesnt work
[23:04:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: try now
[23:04:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/S5D5G/2/
[23:04:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> chagnes jquery ui version
[23:04:55] <jphase> so what needs to change exactly?
[23:07:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> i want it sortable but only when the click occurs in the first cell
[23:08:49] <HQRaja> I've finally managed building tic-tac-toe that's fully working: http://jsfiddle.net/c3gEt/1/ but I've been filling divs with two colors instead of O and X symbols, primarily because I wanted to keep all visual stuff in CSS and didn't know how to use CSS classes to add alphanumeric characters to divs (or if that's even possible)
[23:09:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> HQRaja: look into pseudo classes :before and :after
[23:09:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: html needs to remain unchanged
[23:09:55] <HQRaja> Rohan_Bhangui: Thanks...lemme do that.
[23:10:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> your welcome
[23:10:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: I know I can apply a class to the first of all the cells but I rather not
[23:10:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> project contraint
[23:11:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> HQRaja: why dont you use an array to store the gameboard data?
[23:11:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> use a 2d array
[23:12:49] <HQRaja> Rohan_Bhangui: Well, I just learned how to do this after experimenting a lot...gonna refine it further for sure, after figuring out that last visual kink (colors instead of symbols)
[23:13:00] <HQRaja> And yeah, arrays sound like a good idea
[23:13:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> HQRaja: I think the use of arrays could improve he logic of your code (imo much more important than visuals)
[23:14:12] <HQRaja> Rohan_Bhangui: That's true...but that's the last visual kink and I just wanna get it out of the way so that I can focus fully on logic afterwards.
[23:14:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> sure i guess
[23:14:23] <HQRaja> :)
[23:14:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> so basically you would need to convert your unicodes to css codes
[23:14:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then u can use content: "[css code for char goes here]";
[23:14:59] <HQRaja> Ah I see
[23:15:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[23:15:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> thats how icon fonts work
[23:15:51] <HQRaja> So the css would look something like div:before { ["css code for char"] } ?
[23:16:13] <HQRaja> And then I just addClass('css:before'); in my javaScript?
[23:16:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: I could use mousedown and check the cell
[23:16:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> that is clciked
[23:16:24] <HQRaja> to the element in question i.e.
[23:16:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> using click event
[23:16:29] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/S5D5G/4/
[23:17:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> HQRaja: more like div:before{ content:"/u2022";}
[23:17:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> and that uniode is for a checkmark
[23:17:22] <HQRaja> Rohan_Bhangui: Ah I see...thanks
[23:17:24] <jphase> oh actually
[23:17:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://www.evotech.net/articles/testjsentities.html
[23:17:32] <jphase> that was still in test mode
[23:17:38] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/S5D5G/5/
[23:17:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> HQRaja: you can use that converted to convert unicode to css code
[23:17:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> thanks j
[23:17:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> jeff
[23:17:54] <HQRaja> Rohan_Bhangui: Awesome!
[23:17:58] <jphase> np
[23:18:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> sick
[23:18:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> i was banging my head of all the complex methods I was thinking of
[23:19:31] <sun> jphase: greg5green: Thank you both for your pointers + insights once more! :)  I'm delegating the resolution to the fine folks who're more familiar with JS than me :) https://drupal.org/node/2161217
[23:19:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay jphase 1 last thing
[23:19:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> how would I select with the same html structure
[23:19:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> all the cells i nthe same row
[23:20:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> something like
[23:20:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> .column(n) .cell
[23:20:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> actually that would be wrong
[23:21:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: I know there is somethign like this in regular html
[23:21:54] <jphase> well, that'd be a bit trickier to do dynamically, but you could do that with nth-child(#)
[23:21:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1775466/how-to-get-cells-td-x-and-y-coordinate-in-table-using-jquery
[23:22:36] <jphase> so if you replace the :first-child in my example with :nth-child(#) where # is the row starting at 1
[23:23:32] <jphase> so like... http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/S5D5G/6/
[23:24:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: I get that how to do it on click
[23:24:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> I guess I would have to find the nubmer for the the cell relative to its column parent
[23:25:07] <jphase> yeah, you can grab the cell's index with $(this).index() within your mousedown event and then call sortable based on that
[23:25:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> cuase i need to be able to move rows around later (like sorting and stuff)
[23:25:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay thanks
[23:26:02] <jphase> np
[23:26:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> i dont get return value with $(this).index
[23:26:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> when I console it
[23:26:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: ^
[23:27:44] <jphase> .index()
[23:28:14] <jphase> jQuery method rather than an object property
[23:28:28] <HQRaja> Rohan_Bhangui: I tried that but it doesn't seem to be working. =( http://jsfiddle.net/c3gEt/2/
[23:29:20] <HQRaja> replaced the class assignments and checks from 'naught' to 'naught:before' throughout my javascript...same goes for 'cross'
[23:29:27] <HQRaja> I was supposed to do that, right?
[23:29:31] <ricomoss> I have a JSON response (http://pastebin.com/jx5ALGmk) I need to parse.  I'm new to jQuery/JS and don't know how I would do this.  Anyone have some code examples you could point me to?
[23:30:19] <jphase> ricomoss: look into using $.parseJSON to turn it into an object for you
[23:30:41] <jphase> var response = $.parseJSON(dataFROMserver); type thing
[23:32:25] <ricomoss> I'm doing this in Meteor on the server side.  I'm getting a ReferenceError on '$'.
[23:32:46] <HQRaja> Rohan_Bhangui: Are you still around?
[23:32:47] <ricomoss> Should I be looking for a solution elsewhere?  Maybe this isn't a jquery question?
[23:33:48] <jphase> ricomoss: yeah not really a jQuery question but I believe you can just use JSON.parse(yourStuff) in meteor
[23:34:31] <ricomoss> Ok, sorry about that.  Thanks.
[23:35:20] <HQRaja> jphase: Would you mind taking a look at my code? http://jsfiddle.net/c3gEt/2/
[23:35:41] <jphase> ooo, tic tac toe
[23:36:22] <HQRaja> yep :) Was working when I was using colored backgrounds for my divs to indicate the moves (simply assigning classes using javascript)
[23:36:47] <HQRaja> Just tried using the :before pseudo class to insert symbols directly, and it's broken
[23:37:22] <jphase> hmm
[23:37:29] <jphase> you're adding a class of nought:before
[23:37:38] <jphase> which would be like... class="nought:before"
[23:37:38] <HQRaja> yep
[23:38:13] <HQRaja> That's right...and nought:before is what I've used in the stylesheet to add the symbol
[23:38:18] <jphase> out of curiosity what's the need for the pseudo class?
[23:39:06] <jphase> HQRaja: and when you add the class, just add nought, the css pseudo selector will work that way
[23:39:18] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/c3gEt/3/
[23:39:19] <HQRaja> jphase: I want to add X and O symbols to the boxes. What I was doing before (which works) was this: http://jsfiddle.net/c3gEt/
[23:39:27] <HQRaja> Thanks...lemme take a look
[23:40:13] <jphase> oh, looks like you need to update the rest of the :before stuff in the jQuery
[23:40:40] <HQRaja> You mean I shouldn't use :before in jquery?
[23:40:45] <jphase> just add/remove/check classes based on nought or cross without the before. the :before pseudo class will just be in css
[23:40:46] <jphase> correct
[23:41:07] <jphase> .blah:before in css will activate on an element like class="blah"
[23:41:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> HQRaja: sry had to take a very large dump
[23:41:50] <HQRaja> jphase: Ah I see. So the :before only needs to go into the CSS, and the jquery remains the same?
[23:42:08] <jphase> correct
[23:42:12] <HQRaja> Rohan_Bhangui: Heh it's all good
[23:42:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay ya jphase is very competent
[23:42:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> helps me a ton all the time
[23:42:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> HQRaja: ^
[23:43:13] <jphase> neat to see a functional tic tac toe in jQuery/js though HQRaja, looks good ;]
[23:43:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[23:43:25] <HQRaja> Thanks jphase :)
[23:44:15] <jphase> np
[23:56:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: next challenge collapsable rows
[23:56:20] <jphase> like on click?
[23:56:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes
[23:56:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: also quick quesito when .sortables() is adde ddoes it disable selecting text
[23:57:21] <jphase> no, you can still select text
[23:58:37] <jphase> and the collapsable thing might conflict with your sortable, but it'd be something like  $('.cell').click(function(){ $('.cell:nth-child(' + $(this).index() + ')').slideToggle(); });
[23:58:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> well I need to structure them
[23:58:52] <jphase> might have to add 1 to that or something, idk I didn't test
[23:59:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> as in creat  a tree structure
[23:59:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> and I can modify the html to do this
