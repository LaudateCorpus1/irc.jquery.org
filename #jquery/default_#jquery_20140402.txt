[00:23:47] <ocx> any idea why when i set first_boot=no it is not taking effect? 	if ($boot == "yes") {  		$("<div><a><p>NEW</p></a></div>").appendTo(document.body); 		window.localStorage.setItem("first_boot", "no"); 	}
[00:23:59] <ocx> it stays yes
[00:24:58] <Cork> ocx: you need to update the variable
[00:25:06] <Cork> ocx: btw why do you have $ on all your variables?
[00:25:26] <ocx> treminds me it is a jquery variable Cork, dunno
[00:25:47] <Cork> ocx: but you use it for none jquery variables too
[00:26:06] <ocx> yea right , bad habit i will fix that
[00:26:41] <ocx> Cork: the setItem does not update?
[00:26:49] <Cork> it updates the database
[00:27:17] <Cork> not random variable that holds data that once came from the database
[00:30:19] <ocx> Cork: i am doing setItem on index.html and then in the second page i amd doing getItem and setting checkboxes accordingly, like: index.html 	window.localStorage.setItem("first_boot", "yes");     and page2.html  	var $boot = window.localStorage.getItem("first_boot");  	if ($first_boot== "yes") { $('music').prop('checked', true); }
[00:30:42] <ocx> the page2.html is called via jqm
[00:30:56] <Cork> are you sure your code is actually called?
[00:36:44] <ocx> Cork: yes it is in a <script></script> in the body
[00:37:11] <Cork> ocx: that is still assumption
[00:37:28] <Cork> ocx: make an alert/console.log/something to make sure it actually runs
[00:39:04] <ocx> http://pastebin.com/NCfXqqhR <-- Cork this works i see NEW
[00:39:14] <ocx> but i cannot change true to false afterwards
[00:39:27] <Cork> ocx: uh so again
[00:39:40] <Cork> ocx: after you modify the database you need to grab it again
[00:39:57] <Cork> ocx: you doesn't even load the value in $boot on page2
[00:40:05] <Cork> *you don't even
[00:40:35] <ocx> i do, forgot to paste it var $boot = window.localStorage.getItem("first_boot");
[00:40:46] <acidjazz> why $boot
[00:40:53] <ocx> yea i will fix that
[00:47:52] <JavaLover> I have a very nice rotation animation...the problem is it takes up too much memory. Any thoughts on converting the rotation animation into a sprite animation instead & would this solve my memory issue?
[00:49:34] <fabioportieri> JavaLover: or, use css3
[00:50:00] <kk_drop> JavaLover, css3 canvas
[00:50:56] <JavaLover> is css3 backward compatible?
[00:51:11] <JavaLover> and i need to rotate like i'm spinning a wheel
[00:51:17] <JavaLover> the wheels have to spin....
[00:51:35] <JavaLover> like wheel of fortune
[00:51:45] <JavaLover> you click & it spins the wheel...
[00:52:30] <ocx> Cork: is there a jquery function that will run function1 when checkbox is on and another if checkbox is off?
[00:53:28] <Cork> ocx: no
[00:53:43] <ocx> ok i will check manually then
[01:06:20] <dev_> hi, I have a piece of code that don't work
[01:06:27] <dev_> <pasting now>
[01:07:42] <dev_> http://pastebin.com/8xGHJtc7
[01:07:56] <dev_> it toggles only first element using the class
[01:08:11] <dev_> if I have 2 elements *
[01:08:16] <xec> that's an ID not a class
[01:08:27] <xec> use $(".toggle") instead
[01:08:40] <dev_> oh I changed the wrong thing
[01:08:51] <dev_> sorry I'm sleep deprived
[01:09:15] <xec> also, you should consider using html-* attributes for custom data
[01:09:27] <xec> i.e. <a data-value="something">
[01:09:35] <dev_> ok, thanks for tip
[01:09:51] <dev_> that is part of specification ?
[01:09:58] <xec> yes
[01:09:58] <Cork> html- attributes, that's a new one :)
[01:10:02] <xec> part of html5
[01:10:08] <dev_> oh nice i never knew
[01:10:30] <Cork> dev_: it's data- though not html-
[01:10:35] <xec> oh sorry
[01:10:36] <xec> yes
[01:10:40] <xec> data-
[01:10:44] <xec> Cork++
[01:10:53] <dev_> Cork, yes i see from the second post of xec and corrected
[01:10:53] <xec> i'm sleep deprived too :D
[01:10:59] <dev_> hehehe ^^
[01:11:09] <xec> anyway, you can retrieve it with $(this).data("value")
[01:11:10] <xec> :)
[01:11:18] <dev_> oh cool
[01:11:45] <dev_> it works now lol
[01:11:47] <dev_> thanks
[01:11:52] <xec> np :)
[01:17:43] <ocx> can i do this?  $("#checkbox-1a").click(function(ev) {     if (this.checked) {..... }
[01:19:01] <xec> i don't see why not
[01:19:08] <systemfault> ocx: Try the change event if it doesn’t work.
[01:19:12] <xec> why do you ask, doesn't it work?
[01:19:34] <ocx> yea i am facing some problems with "this"
[01:19:38] <ocx> i will try change
[01:19:56] <ocx> in this case this should return #checkbox-1a"
[01:20:07] <xec> ocx: http://jsfiddle.net/eA87X/
[01:21:00] <xec> i assume the ID is on the actual checkbox element
[01:21:21] <xec> and it's not some fancy replaced element for styling etc ;)
[01:23:57] <xec> (if it is, you could try .on("change", ...) instead)
[01:24:17] <fabioportieri> click is supposed to work fine
[01:24:22] <aro> is there a way to calculate the position of an element in a list
[01:24:32] <fabioportieri> change triggers after losing focus iirc
[01:24:33] <aro> like if you have 6 list items, calculate the offset of the third one?
[01:24:37] <Cork> aro: .index()
[01:24:44] <aro> ok thanks
[01:24:48] <Cork> or do you mean the graphical offset?
[01:24:54] <aro> whats the difference
[01:25:05] <Cork> index() give the index in the list
[01:25:11] <aro> yeah i think thats what i need
[01:25:13] <Cork> not the px distance
[01:25:13] <aro> not pixel offset
[01:30:07] <ghostlines> hi, how can i execute an action after someone clicks ok on a prompt window?
[01:33:02] <aro> is it possible to calculate reverse index?
[01:33:11] <aro> like index from the bottom
[01:33:43] <xec> yes, with basic aritmetic
[01:33:47] <xec> +h
[01:35:01] <xec> (find the .length of all the items, then subtract the current?)
[01:35:27] <aro> ok
[01:50:47] <fosser_josh> i want to retrieve div class name, whenever click event occurred on element inside that div. How can i do that? I tried e.srcElement.className which raise error (TypeError : Cannot read property 'className' of undefined)
[01:52:23] <fosser_josh> http://pastebin.com/nYz8akBh here is the code
[01:52:35] <fabioportieri> fosser_josh: this.className inside $("yourSelector").click(function()  {});
[01:53:02] <fabioportieri> ah no wait
[01:54:08] <fosser_josh> fabioportieri: that will give me element class name. I am looking for div classname
[01:54:41] <Cork> there is no div in there...
[01:55:03] <Cork> ah
[01:55:15] <fabioportieri> yes, do $(this).closest('div[class^="yourclass"]');
[01:55:15] <Cork> so you want he class of the parent?
[01:55:21] <Cork> uh
[01:55:26] <Cork> no don't use class^=
[01:55:36] <fabioportieri> div.yourClass ?
[01:55:39] <fosser_josh> Cork: yes
[01:55:39] <Cork> ya
[01:55:49] <Cork> or just $(this).closest('div')[0].className
[01:56:00] <Cork> or $(this).closest('div').prop('className')
[01:58:19] <gingitsune> $('tbody').append('row');
[01:58:43] <gingitsune> is there a easy way to get the appended element and not the table itself
[01:58:51] <gingitsune> i want to hightlight the added row
[01:59:04] <Cork> gingitsune: parse the content first
[01:59:06] <Cork> and then append it
[01:59:11] <Cork> or revert the order
[01:59:25] <Cork> $('row').appendTo('tbody');
[01:59:49] <fosser_josh> Cork: just for more info if i want id of div will $(this).closest('div')[0].idName work?
[02:00:19] <Cork> na
[02:00:24] <Cork> just do attr('id')
[02:00:34] <Cork> $(this).closest('div').attr('id')
[02:10:05] <dev_> thanks guys :) cya
[02:11:04] <SprkDev> I want to just change border color to red on that condition, not working. why? http://jsfiddle.net/Sa2rF/
[02:11:57] <Cork> SprkDev: most likely cause you don't have a <show> element in your dom :)
[02:11:59] <fabioportieri> SprkDev: the condition is not met, or the selector is wrong
[02:12:43] <Cork> meaning you want to change $('.comment-form show') to $('.comment-form.show')
[02:13:21] <gingitsune> Corey, thank you. Works like a charm :)
[02:14:18] <Carty> why is not possible to message people in the #html channel?
[02:15:14] <Cork> Carty: should work
[02:15:22] <Cork> there is no special flags on that channel
[02:15:38] <Carty> [10:13] <Carty> hi [10:13] == Cannot send to channel: #html
[02:16:39] <Carty> hmm, I get the message saying I cannot send there
[02:16:47] <Carty> do you have some sort of Freenode account?
[02:17:13] <Cork> Carty: if the channel was R it would be nickserv
[02:17:15] <Cork> but it isn't
[02:17:26] <Cork> but ya, you could try registring your nick
[02:17:31] <Cork> /ns help register
[02:25:20] <SprkDev> How do I put this  .5s step-end infinte alternate inside this: $("'myField").css(  ) ?
[02:25:44] <Cork> SprkDev: you don't
[02:25:55] <Cork> hmm oh wait sorry
[02:26:00] <SprkDev> but I need it to be inside jquery css
[02:26:14] <Cork> css('transision', '.5s step-end infinte alternate')
[02:26:25] <Cork> SprkDev: ya, i thought you meant a @ declaration
[02:26:49] <Cork> wait a min
[02:27:01] <xec> transition* -- but with "alternate" there, maybe animation ?
[02:27:11] <Cork> ya
[02:27:23] <Cork> animation is what you want
[02:27:37] <Cork> digging in ldap and i'm spacing out a bit...
[02:27:41] <fosser_josh> Cork: hi, sorry my net disconnected. thanks for help on $(this).closest('div').attr('id'). much appreciated.
[02:33:00] <SprkDev> yeah
[02:42:53] <unnu> question: is there an easy way to wrap / unwrap html formatting with jquery/javascript
[02:45:40] <stefancrs> morning
[02:45:52] <fabioportieri> unnu: jquery has .wrap()
[02:46:14] <unnu> hrmm. . . it doesn't seem to work the way i want it to
[02:46:18] <stefancrs> I have a touch event listener on my main div (to fetch swipes), but that also fetches touches/clicks on video elements. Is there a way to prevent that?
[02:58:29] <SprkDev> can I get the value of a field by the name on it like <input type="text" name="comment"  />?
[02:58:44] <SprkDev> Can I use name for javascript or is that just for php?
[03:00:43] <decx> $('input[name="text"]', context)
[03:01:10] <decx> it's advisable to put it in a context because the attribute selector is pretty slow by itself
[03:01:42] <SprkDev> what about comment.value?
[03:02:06] <decx> that's just .val() on your selector
[03:03:50] <SprkDev> so it would work?
[03:05:23] <fabioportieri> no. jquery has .val() but it just doesn't work. but we like to keep it
[03:07:50] <Cork> fabioportieri: what doesn't work?
[03:08:09] <decx> joke
[03:08:10] <decx> *
[03:08:11] <decx> *
[03:08:11] <decx> *
[03:08:12] <decx> cork
[03:08:39] <fabioportieri> yea sorry for the sarcasm
[03:16:02] <t_user> not sure if he got it.. SprkDev: $('input[name=comment]').val()
[03:16:50] <decx> fyi, attribute selectors are terrible, so it's always best to put that in a context
[03:17:10] <decx> like $('input[name=comment]','#myform')
[03:17:35] <SprkDev> okay, thats good thanks. THe thing is I've already got this working. But needed to know specifically if the name attribute could be used to access the value in the text field using javascript, since I have always thought it would only be accessed by php in form submssions.
[03:19:04] <Cork> also always; always quite your attribute values
[03:19:25] <Cork> else you end up hunting for why something isn't working cause the quotes are needed
[03:20:10] <t_user> decx, yep! however, when i can't tell the skill-level of anyone asking a question in here, i usually spare them the performance/extra parts to not confuse them too much
[03:20:30] <decx> true
[03:51:12] <SprkDev> How do I escape characters in javascript to prevent sql injection attacks?
[03:51:30] <Cork> SprkDev: you don't
[03:51:40] <Cork> you do that server side
[03:51:44] <Cork> never ever client side
[03:51:51] <Cork> SprkDev: unless you mean websql
[03:51:55] <SprkDev> So its not necessary?
[03:52:10] <Cork> SprkDev: are you talking about websql?
[03:52:43] <SprkDev> I'm adding comments to wordpress database using ajax. It works fine. Just needed to know if I needed to escape the javascript variable before passing it on to the ajax index file.
[03:53:01] <Cork> SprkDev: ya, it is necessary
[03:53:07] <Cork> but you MUST do it server side
[03:53:13] <SprkDev> you mean in PHP?
[03:53:23] <Cork> you should never ever EVER accept sql from remote clients
[03:53:39] <Cork> yes you need to make sure what you get from the net is secure before you execute the sql
[03:53:50] <SprkDev> by using mysql_real_escape_string ?
[03:53:56] <SprkDev> function
[03:56:08] <didiergm> JQM animations: what would be the recommended way to show a page a div at a time with the same animations as the one existing for pages & popups ?
[03:56:58] <didiergm> this implies that a page is made of several divs of course - initially all divs bar the first would be hidden
[03:57:18] <SprkDev> So I was right. I only need to do it backend using php. mysql_escape_string. And the senior developer here is wrong.
[04:05:26] <CrowX-> var a = $(selector); var b = a;
[04:05:36] <CrowX-> is this the same as
[04:05:49] <CrowX-> var a = $(selector); var b = $(selector);
[04:05:50] <CrowX-> ?
[04:07:09] <wfx> how do i add a event to an element that is loaded by load()?
[04:07:18] <Cork> CrowX-: no
[04:07:23] <CrowX-> ok
[04:07:29] <Cork> CrowX-: it is quite similar though
[04:07:51] <Cork> CrowX-: the difference is that the second one creates a separate jquery object with the list of the dom elements
[04:08:01] <Cork> CrowX-: while the first one just points to the same object
[04:08:04] <CrowX-> Cork, if I use the first example, and later change 'a' to point ot another selector. Does 'b' change too?
[04:08:33] <CrowX-> also, in the same example, if I change 'b', does 'a' change?
[04:08:36] <Cork> CrowX-: no
[04:08:47] <Cork> CrowX-: but if you add a value to the object b will see it
[04:09:11] <Cork> var a = $(selector); var b = a; b.something = 'here'; a.something === 'here'
[04:10:41] <CrowX-> Cork, but if I add this? " var a = $(selector); var b = a;"  "a = (anotherSelector)"  is b also pointing to anotherSelector?
[04:11:41] <Cork> CrowX-: no, cause you stopped pointing on the object
[04:12:19] <Cork> CrowX-: var a = { obj: $(selector) }; b = a; a.obj = $(otherSelector);
[04:12:23] <Cork> will change both a and b though
[04:15:20] <xec> wfx: you can put the code after the element loading part? :) or use a delegate
[04:15:42] <xec> wfx: do you have a specific use case/some code?
[04:16:29] <wfx> xec: where can i post some example
[04:22:31] <wfx> xec: do you get the link?
[04:22:57] <xec> yes, but im not sure what i'm looking at. could you post the relevant parts at jsfiddle.net instead?
[04:24:39] <wfx> http://jsfiddle.net/WujSx/
[04:26:01] <wfx> xec: i want to add the $('nano') to a loaded content.
[04:27:07] <Cork> wfx: best is prob to delegate that event listener
[04:27:15] <Cork> instead of attaching it as you add it
[04:28:24] <xec> yeah. except $(".nano").nanoScroller() doesn't look like an event handler
[04:28:44] <xec> what exactly is nanoScroller?
[04:29:23] <erming> looks like a scrollbar replacement
[04:30:50] <xec> its rather hard to tell what that code is supposed to do overall, really...
[04:31:11] <xec> in any case, line 27 is already using delegate syntax
[04:31:17] <erming> wfx: does any part of that code work?
[04:31:27] <xec> so the author should at least be aware of it :D
[04:31:55] <wfx> all only the scroller not becouse i load the content via load()
[04:32:10] <xec> i have no idea what that means
[04:32:31] <erming> because when looking at your code, you dont even fetch the html response from the .load request
[04:32:39] <erming> but maybe you dont want to do it.. yet
[04:32:59] <erming> so it's only the row // $('.nano').nanoScroller({ scroll: 'bottom' }); that doesnt work?
[04:33:25] <erming> what happens if you put this just above that very same line: console.log( $('.nano').size() );
[04:33:30] <wfx> yes (the wtf is only i add to find out my mistake)
[04:33:51] <erming> oh, make that: alert( $('.nano').size() ); instead
[04:34:44] <wfx> alert 0
[04:34:55] <xec> .size() is deprecated btw, just use .length
[04:35:05] <erming> xec ah, thanks, didn't know that!
[04:35:22] <erming> wfx okay, then $('.nano') doesnt find anything
[04:35:27] <xec> oh
[04:35:32] <xec> i think i know what youre trying to do
[04:35:44] <xec> on line 33 you have $(toView).load(toLoad, '' , showNewContent())
[04:35:59] <xec> but you want to pass the function reference, not execute it immediately
[04:36:03] <xec> namely: $(toView).load(toLoad, '' , showNewContent)
[04:36:07] <erming> wfx where is this class="nano" element?
[04:36:22] <xec> erming: its probably part of the content loaded through the .load()
[04:36:25] <erming> xec yeah, but he's not really taking any arguments in showNewContent either
[04:36:32] <wfx> this element is later loader by load()
[04:36:34] <xec> he doesnt need to
[04:36:59] <erming> so .load() automagically adds the loaded content to the dom somehow?
[04:37:00] <xec> erming: .load() inserts the html already, the callback doesnt need to know what that was
[04:37:06] <wfx> yes
[04:37:11] <xec> erming: yes, that's what .load() does
[04:37:36] <xec> wfx: try as I did there, remove the () from the end of showNewContent
[04:37:45] <xec> and let us know if that worked out
[04:37:51] <xec> you should alert 1 instead
[04:38:06] <erming> hmm, never used .join().. where does the content get inserted? i can't find any target
[04:38:19] <xec> .join() ?
[04:38:38] <erming> .load*
[04:38:42] <erming> oh, i see now
[04:38:43] <xec> the target is what you selected
[04:38:50] <wfx> i add the navigation html to jsfiddle
[04:38:56] <erming> had to read the documentation :>
[04:38:58] <xec> $(".target").load(url)
[04:39:58] <xec> namely: $(toView).load(toLoad, showNewContent)
[04:40:01] <xec> sorry
[04:40:08] <xec> wfx*
[04:40:18] <xec> you can use that part, no need for the empty string
[04:40:21] <wfx> done i alert show now 1
[04:40:25] <xec> good :)
[04:40:42] <wfx> please im not so fast as you write :)
[04:46:52] <wfx> thx a lot
[04:47:48] <xec> yw
[04:47:53] <ska-fan> I have a modal that doesn't show when I click the button. It works when I toggle the modal with JS directly. data-target and data-toggle are correct. show and shown events trigger, but the modal div doesn't get display: block added. How would I debug this?
[04:48:17] <ska-fan> I'm thinking of stepping in the jQuery sources unless someone tells me that that's a snake's nest
[04:48:40] <xec> snake nest alert!
[04:49:07] <xec> what is data-toggle btw? some jquery mobile thing?
[04:49:31] <erming> just a custom data attribute
[04:51:11] <erming> ska-fan, the click event has like.. $("#modal").show() ? In that case, you could put a callback into .show(..)
[04:51:31] <erming> .show(function() { alert("Well.. Atleast show was called"); });
[04:51:48] <ska-fan> erming: the show and shown events are triggered alright
[04:51:53] <jdo_dk> Does anyone know if it is possible to get the class of clicked "td" in jquery ui datepicker ?
[04:52:04] <ska-fan> I don't attach a click handler to the button.
[04:52:36] <erming> :>
[04:53:44] <ocx> Cork: is there a way to access a <div> element from the url? like http://url/index.html#<div> ?
[04:54:18] <Cork> ocx: through ajax calls you mean?
[04:54:37] <ocx> yea
[04:54:47] <Cork> no
[04:54:58] <ocx> anything other than ajax works?
[04:54:59] <Cork> you can fetch the entire content and then filter based on css selectors
[04:55:09] <Cork> ocx: no
[04:55:11] <ocx> maybe with curl then
[04:55:19] <ocx> thanks
[04:58:17] <ocx> it would have been so nice if you can just ask for a div on a page instead of loading the whole thing, the web experience would have been way faster dont you think Cork ?
[04:58:59] <Cork> ocx: well you can
[04:59:06] <Cork> if you have server code supporting it
[04:59:13] <Cork> but that is the thing
[04:59:16] <quicksilver> jquery does have built-in code for filtering when it loads
[04:59:28] <quicksilver> but you're still transmitting the whole thing if that's what you care about
[04:59:29] <ocx> i understand that i am obliged to get the whole thing and do the parsing locally
[04:59:37] <Cork> the client can't skip data, it has to receive what the server sends
[04:59:59] <Cork> ocx: what sites normally do is exactly what you talked about
[05:00:13] <Cork> and you request for a section and the server only sends a partial
[05:00:32] <quicksilver> ocx: $('#foo').load("url/index.html #divid")
[05:00:40] <quicksilver> ocx: does what you said more or less
[05:00:47] <Cork> ya
[05:00:58] <ocx> quicksilver: that would get the whole thing but show me the #divid section right?
[05:01:00] <erming> it does, however, load the entire page and then pick that specific div (= overhead)
[05:01:04] <ocx> yea
[05:01:18] <quicksilver> ocx: where "show" means "replace the contents of #foo with"
[05:01:19] <quicksilver> yes.
[05:01:24] <Cork> $.get('url').done(function(data) { $('#foo).html($(data).find('#divid')); }); does the same thing
[05:01:38] <Cork> might be nice to see what that code does
[05:02:06] <quicksilver> but clearly if this somethign you do a lot and you care about overheads you should redesign your ajax endpoints to let you choose the bit you want
[05:02:09] <ocx> maybe some server interface can be written that can do the parsing at server end and send the parsed content to the client
[05:02:16] <quicksilver> very easily
[05:03:18] <ocx> internet browsing would be way faster i think since it will be very well targetted, but it can impact the marketing and ads business since you are getting the juice only hehe
[05:03:41] <erming> ocx but your backend server would have to parse the html, to find that specific #id to deliver
[05:04:13] <ocx> yes erming like i send to the server i need this chink, the ser4ver would get the whole thing locally in a local session ontiself, parse the content and return it to me
[05:04:29] <erming> but it could probably be built into the web server, and parse the html only when needed
[05:04:44] <erming> would be pretty cool
[05:04:50] <ocx> yea
[05:05:04] <erming> too bad url-hashes are already taken :>
[05:05:09] <wfx> works, realy work thx time for a break .... coffeeeeee :)
[05:05:11] <erming> would make a great syntax
[05:05:20] <erming> http://page.com/#this-div-please
[05:05:39] <ocx> i think jqm stands in the way too since it uses #for the page_ids too
[05:06:06] <ocx> in case you got an href="#page_2" for ex
[05:07:09] <erming> your idea actually sparked some great solutions for me.. i've been building sites where i check for isAjax on the backend and then only return parts of the page
[05:07:27] <erming> but targeting a specific ID would be alot smarter
[05:07:48] <jdo_dk> Is there a way to find <td>'s with specific text in jquery ?
[05:08:04] <erming> would probably build it like page.php?get=#id
[05:08:36] <erming> jdo_dk not as a selector, as far as i know
[05:09:16] <erming> jdo_dk you have to do $('td').each(function() { if ($(this).html() === "this string") { // found } };
[05:09:38] <jdo_dk> erming: Thanks. Just found contains, but it will also find 12, when searched for 1
[05:09:47] <jdo_dk> Which is not good enough.
[05:10:13] <erming> Oh, learning something new everyday.. Didn't know about :contains
[05:11:25] <jdo_dk> erming: https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/content-filter-selector/
[05:11:47] <Cork> an alternative is filter
[05:12:09] <Cork> $('td').filter(function() { return $(this).html() == ''; })
[05:12:18] <Cork> it is basically what :contains does
[05:12:37] <Cork> but if what you want to match is a variable it becomes a little less messy
[05:14:58] <dawkirst_> Hi. I'm getting a 'No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource' error, even though I can see that the header is present on the resource. Any ideas?
[05:16:01] <Cork> dawkirst_: it might possibly not match your domain
[05:16:07] <Cork> donno
[05:16:29] <dawkirst_> Cork, I set a "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *" header, so shouldn't be that.
[05:16:38] <Cork> you have a link?
[05:17:42] <dawkirst_> Cork, http://act.glio.co.za/wp-json/posts
[05:20:38] <Cork> dawkirst_: just ran $.get('http://act.glio.co.za/wp-json/posts').done(function(data) { console.log(data); }) on jsfiddle
[05:20:40] <Cork> and it works fine
[05:20:57] <Cork> didn't save cause i'm not sure if you want it public there
[05:21:01] <dawkirst_> Cork, I'm trying to POST though
[05:21:06] <dawkirst_> Cork, thanks, appreciate that
[05:21:19] <Cork> dawkirst: is your server handling the option call?
[05:21:26] <Cork> OPTION that is
[05:21:59] <dawkirst_> Cork, could be that it doesn't! Thanks, I bet it's that (I'll report back).
[05:25:47] <dawkirst> Cork, making a call against that URL with Postman returns a method not supported (for OPTIONS), so maybe it's that it can't make the preflight call?
[05:26:03] <Cork> yes
[05:27:35] <dawkirst> Cork, in Chrome I can't see that an OPTIONS request is being made though...it's a POST
[05:29:51] <Cork> dawkirst: the option call has to be made before the post can happen cross domain
[05:30:03] <Cork> not sure if chrome list those though
[05:30:08] <dawkirst> Ok.
[05:30:33] <Cork> dawkirst: cause else you break the cors protection
[05:30:47] <Cork> as the post has already happened when the headers comes back :)
[05:31:48] <bristleback> Hi
[05:32:07] <drager> How can I add an value with the old with jquery? like val +=?
[05:32:51] <xec> you mean set a value?
[05:33:04] <bristleback> drager: that is not about jquery, but about javascript
[05:33:10] <xec> .val(newValue)
[05:33:19] <shoky> .val(function(i, oldVal) { return oldVal + 'omg'; })
[05:33:26] <drager> ah yes
[05:33:30] <drager> thanks guys
[05:33:40] <xec> or .val(.val() + newVal)
[05:33:50] <xec> obviously with something bevore the . ;)
[05:34:15] * xec sits on shoky
[05:34:31] <xec> i'm sure you'll be glad to hear i've gained some weight lately
[05:35:26] <shoky> you're blocking my arteries man
[05:35:41] <xec> arteries? pft. who needs 'em
[05:35:53] <shoky> yahh veins ftw
[05:36:08] <xec> go team veins
[05:42:39] <lianzinho> guys, I'm having this error at the console, but without line number information: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token )
[05:43:21] <lianzinho> how can I spot this?
[05:43:34] <Cork> lianzinho: you should have a line number
[05:43:51] <Cork> try in a different browser if you don't get one
[05:44:46] <erming> lianzinho: are you inputting code directly into the console?
[05:47:20] <lianzinho> erming: no… I'm clicking in a link that should trigger some stuff… the stuff is not vein triggered and I'm getting this error
[05:47:56] <lianzinho> now I see that there's something to do with the anchor href being "javascript:void()"
[05:49:25] <erming> it's trying to cancel the click event
[05:49:40] <erming> i think "javascript:void(0)" still works, so add that 0 if you want
[05:50:11] <lianzinho> It's strange, it was working days ago, I'll add the 0 and see if it solves
[05:50:50] <Cork> lianzinho: or you could just not abuse a tags :)
[05:50:54] <erming> you could remove it, and cancel the event from jQuery instead
[05:51:02] <SprkDev> how do I get the jquery popover to work inside modal. bootstrap. Please note that these are all working individual. So the popover works on the page without modal. The modal works without the popover. But not both. Anyone know why>
[05:51:04] <SprkDev> ?
[05:51:18] <Cork> erming: the javascript:void(0) is an alternative to href="#"
[05:51:35] <Cork> it is when you use a tags when you shouldn't be using it
[05:52:39] <erming> oh, Cork, i know
[05:53:24] <erming> but he wanted a solution to his problem :D
[05:54:09] <Cork> erming: it isn't a solution though
[05:54:19] <Cork> as it is a solution to a different problem :)
[05:54:42] <xec> void isn't a function, so void() doesn
[05:54:47] <xec> 't make sense, really :P
[05:54:54] <xec> s/\n//
[05:55:27] <erming> hehe.. stackoverflow: "void[MDN] is a prefix keyword that takes one argument and always returns undefined."
[05:55:31] <erming> some magic right there
[05:56:37] <erming> so it's basically like return x; and return(x);
[05:57:02] <xec> yeah return isn't a function either :P
[05:57:04] <Cork> ya
[05:57:26] <xec> and typeof
[05:57:30] <xec> (just to add to the list)
[05:57:39] <Cork> or any of the other keywords
[05:58:24] <xec> yeah but typeof is constantly used with parens
[05:58:29] <xec> which annoys me ;)
[05:59:26] <Cork> i prefer to use parenthesis on those
[06:01:21] <erming> *dings the bell* .. fight!
[06:02:56] <lianzinho> Cork: but I need a real anchor tag...
[06:03:09] <Cork> lianzinho: why?
[06:03:12] <lianzinho> Cork: but don't want it to follow any link
[06:03:38] <Cork> <span class="link">i'm a fake link</span>
[06:03:42] <decx> just omit the href
[06:03:45] <decx> easy as pie
[06:03:57] <Cork> decx: though that isn't valid
[06:04:02] <decx> it is
[06:04:09] <decx> href isn'T mandatory
[06:04:30] <xec> it is actually, according to the spec
[06:04:35] <xec> browsers are friendly though
[06:04:39] <erming> without href you dont get cursor: pointer;
[06:04:53] <erming> i'd say: do what you want with the link, but turn if off from jQuery
[06:05:00] <xec> in any case, cork is right, if you don't want a link that follows a url, don't use <a>
[06:05:08] <erming> $("selector").on("click", function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[06:05:17] <Cork> decx: hmm, your right, it is valid
[06:05:18] <decx> Authors may also create an A element that specifies no anchors, i.e., that doesn't specify href, name, or id. Values for these attributes may be set at a later time through scripts. source: http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html
[06:05:24] <Naeblis> Polar_: .
[06:05:29] <Cork> decx: it doesn't change the fact about semantically wrong though
[06:05:32] <erming> i use <a> tags for clickable things, just to prevent selection from happening when i spam-click
[06:05:39] <Cork> decx: also reference a modern standard not 4.01
[06:05:50] <lianzinho> it's not working but not raising any kind of error, too strange
[06:06:13] <Cork> erming: you can easily handle that from css though
[06:06:24] <decx> hm what would make it unsemantic
[06:06:25] <erming> how?
[06:06:32] <Cork> or set tabindex="0" and it will behave exactly like an <a> tag
[06:06:42] <decx> i remember having to do <a name="anchor"> to scroll to #anchor
[06:06:43] <Cork> decx: you say "here a link to"
[06:06:54] <erming> ah, will try that one
[06:06:55] <decx> before it worked with id="anchor"
[06:06:59] <Cork> decx: and that is an old standard yes
[06:07:11] <xec> there is no such word as "unsemantic" btw.
[06:07:23] * xec hides behind some bushes to watch the war
[06:07:42] <decx> antisemantic grammar nazi :>
[06:07:44] <CrowX-> how can I make an image always open at max-height to the screen's height and max-width to the screen width?
[06:08:04] <Velveeta> position: absolute; left/right/top/bottom: 0?
[06:08:50] <CrowX-> Velveeta, but I don't want the image to stretch
[06:08:55] <Cork> CrowX-: max-width/height is your friend
[06:08:59] <xec> that's a css question
[06:09:01] <Velveeta> oh gotcha, *max*-width
[06:09:03] <xec> but cork is right
[06:09:10] <CrowX-> i thought some js magic was required
[06:09:33] <decx> the easiest thing is setting the images as a background and using background-size: cover
[06:09:34] <xec> it depends on the context though
[06:09:40] <decx> contain*
[06:09:49] <CrowX-> they can't go as background though. it's a slider :)
[06:09:49] <Velveeta> yeah, i'm not sure how to do that with pure css, if max-height/weight will respect 100% values, width should, but i'm not sure about height
[06:09:50] <xec> decx: that will crop out parts of the image
[06:10:02] <decx> yes i thought that was the point
[06:10:12] <Velveeta> although, it should maintain its aspect ratio if you *just* set max-width to 100%
[06:10:14] <decx> then it doesnt change aspect and fills the full space
[06:10:24] <xec> decx: i thought he always wanted it inside the screen max height/width
[06:10:26] <decx> regardless of viewport ratio
[06:10:34] <CrowX-> How do I make the max width be the screen's hight minus the other elements that might occupy it?
[06:10:48] <xec> decx: as opposed to fill
[06:11:02] <Cork> CrowX-: you would have to solve that by wrappings in the page
[06:11:06] <decx> i don't know the context :>
[06:11:13] <CrowX-> ok
[06:12:09] <lianzinho> well, when I clone something using clone(true,true) shouldn't the children be cloned with the events?
[06:12:46] <xec> lianzinho: yes
[06:13:46] <shoky> huh, had no idea .clone(true) is same as .clone(true, true)
[06:15:18] <xec> it isn't?
[06:15:29] <Cork> shoky: as it extends the default behavior with an option to not do it deep
[06:15:37] <shoky> xec it is
[06:15:52] <xec> oh indeed it is
[06:15:54] <shoky> Cork yep i see that now, didn't notice it before
[06:15:58] <xec> default: value of withDataAndEvents
[06:16:00] <xec> clever
[06:16:25] <Cork> shoky: i predate the extra option so i often forget it exists as a option :)
[06:16:34] <shoky> ;]
[06:40:09] <SprkDev> popover won't work in modal
[06:40:09] <SprkDev> why?
[06:40:13] <SprkDev> popover won't work in modal
[06:40:14] <SprkDev> why?
[06:48:01] <jomofcw> Hello !
[06:48:34] <jomofcw> Is there a way to prevent my user to get out of the page on another way than using the button "save" or "cancel", please ?
[06:48:55] <Cork> jomofcw: no
[06:48:59] <Bloomberg> Hi Guys!!
[06:49:20] <Bloomberg> how can I get the focusout event in datepicker jquery plugin?
[06:49:22] <Cork> jomofcw: your basically forced to handle the leaving without notifying you
[06:50:24] <jomofcw> Cork hello ! Hm "forced to handle the leaving" ?
[06:50:53] <Cork> jomofcw: meaning there used to be an event handler you could use to block it in most browsers
[06:51:07] <jomofcw> I find this, but dunno if it works with an unload after a "previous" or "next" action from the browser.
[06:51:10] <Cork> jomofcw: but it has been abused to much that most browsers either add ways to ignore it
[06:51:19] <Cork> jomofcw: it straight up doesn't support the event
[06:51:39] <Cork> jomofcw: you can use beforeunload
[06:51:54] <Cork> but like i said, it is close to a deprecated event now days
[06:52:09] <jomofcw> Cork OK but by default the browser handle it ? It's about a backoffice function, I've got 5 users that will use it, all in the firm and on computer I control.
[06:52:19] <Cork> jomofcw: the default for older
[06:52:45] <drager> I'm catching an click on an button and then I call on one function, but I want that other function only to return when pressing another button... Ideas? https://dpaste.de/ucxy
[06:52:46] <Cork> most newer either doesn't support it at all; the dialog is tab modal so just clicking the x button again ignores it
[06:52:56] <jomofcw> Cork hm :/ currently when I try to get out of Gmail without saving my e-mail, using Firefox or Chrom (latest version) it warn me about it. I can't do the same ?
[06:52:57] <Cork> jomofcw: or similar solutions
[06:53:05] <Cork> and these are the default actions
[06:53:20] <jomofcw> Cork hm Ok I understand.
[06:53:22] <Cork> jomofcw: that is the beforeunload evnet
[06:53:34] <Cork> and ya, it is about to basically be ignored
[06:53:49] <jomofcw> OK Cork, thanks for your help !
[06:54:52] <drager> Is it possible?
[06:55:23] <Cork> drager: no it isn't
[06:55:42] <Cork> drager: js is single threaded, so you can't have that behavior
[06:55:44] <drager> Cork: Hm, how should I get the values from the input?
[06:55:50] <drager> I see
[06:55:57] <krambiorix> how can i bind a keyupevent like this? $('body').on('keydown','.mytable > tbody > tr > td:last > input',function(e) {    when i do a keyup in the last input field of a table row, it doesn't trigger... :s
[06:57:08] <Cork> krambiorix: you select the first input in the last td of every td
[06:57:10] <Cork> *tr
[06:57:14] <Cork> not the last input
[06:58:35] <krambiorix> Cork: i select the  input in the last td of every tr, right?
[06:58:55] <krambiorix> Cork,  there is only on input in every td
[06:58:56] <Cork> krambiorix: actually
[06:58:58] <Cork> no
[06:59:18] <Cork> you select all the td that is a direct child of the tr
[06:59:24] <Cork> and from those td you grab the last of them
[06:59:33] <Cork> and grab the inputs from inside it
[06:59:35] <krambiorix> Cork, but i use td:last
[06:59:39] <Cork> (sorry read the selector wrong)
[06:59:43] <Cork> krambiorix: yes
[06:59:57] <Cork> krambiorix: '.mytable > tbody > tr > td:last > input' is the same as
[07:00:00] <drager> Cork: Do you have any idea how I can get the data I want?
[07:00:16] <Cork> $('.mytable > tbody > tr > td').last().children('input')
[07:00:34] <Cork> drager: not sure what it is you want to do
[07:00:49] <krambiorix> Cork, i don't see how that is different from   i select the  input in the last td of every tr
[07:00:58] <Cork> krambiorix: you most likely want :last-child
[07:01:01] <drager> Cork: I bring up and popup/modal with two inputs. I want to grab the values in the inputs.
[07:01:09] <Cork> krambiorix: it isn't the last of every
[07:01:29] <Cork> krambiorix: you grab all td that is a direct child of tr that is a direct child...
[07:01:34] <Cork> from that list you grab the last td
[07:01:42] <Cork> and in that you grab all the inputs
[07:01:47] <Cork> you only select one td
[07:02:07] <krambiorix> Cork you're right (again)
[07:02:15] <Cork> krambiorix: that is the difference between jquery :last and css :last-child
[07:02:29] <krambiorix> Cork, when using > in a selector, is it the same as using find(...) ?
[07:02:46] <Cork> krambiorix: you it just means it has to be a direct child
[07:02:53] <Cork> uh
[07:03:03] <Cork> *no, it just means it has to be
[07:03:18] <krambiorix> Cork ow ok
[07:03:26] <krambiorix> it has to be a child (with find)
[07:03:34] <Cork> uh...
[07:03:46] <Cork> find means it has to be a child or grandchild or...
[07:03:56] <Cork> > means it has to be a direct child of the parent
[07:04:31] <Cork> meaning '.a > .b' won't match <b class="a"><span><b class="b"></b></span></b>
[07:04:52] <Cork> but '.a .b' will
[07:05:13] <krambiorix> but how would .a > .b match?
[07:05:53] <NoiseEee> i hate > selectors
[07:06:00] <NoiseEee> i gotta say in all my years, never used a single one.
[07:06:39] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: You must have been able to change any HTML you want. Jealous of that.
[07:07:19] <NoiseEee> yes, yes i am :)
[07:18:32] <jomofcw> Is it possible to "convert" a "[object HTMLButtonElement]" in a jQuery element ? please.
[07:19:35] <NoiseEee> jomofcw: what does that mean
[07:21:21] <BillCriswell> $( thatVar );
[07:21:26] <xec> BillCriswell++
[07:21:30] <xec> beat me to it
[07:22:01] <jomofcw> NoiseEee it's related to my previous question about https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.onbeforeunload. I would like to use the e.explicitOriginalTarget to test if it's a button or not.
[07:28:41] <BillCriswell> jomofcw: $( e.explicitOriginalTarget )
[07:30:46] <gingitsune> I have a table that i'm inserting a row into. There is a case where i need to destroy and then recreate it and then append. In this case it doesn't append.
[07:31:36] <gingitsune> I'm appending with appendTo
[07:32:06] <NoiseEee> gingitsune: clone the table first, append to the clone
[07:32:14] <NoiseEee> then put the clone in the DOM
[07:33:37] <gingitsune> NoiseEee, i'm removing the table because i need to get a completely different set of results from the db
[07:34:22] <gingitsune> I'm changing the category of the row
[07:34:36] <gingitsune> in my implementation when the user switches to the other categories view
[07:34:37] <NoiseEee> gingitsune: im not really following you. break it down into steps, the answer will reveal itself
[07:35:06] <gingitsune> the table is removed. an ajax request fetches the new table
[07:35:16] <NoiseEee> ok
[07:35:29] <gingitsune> thus i cannot clone the old table, as i need a new set of data
[07:35:55] <gingitsune> as far as i see  it should append ether way
[07:35:58] <NoiseEee> okay, fine so you have your new table.  the ajax response is html, ie: "<table>" etc?
[07:36:05] <gingitsune> yep
[07:36:16] <gingitsune> as the names are the same just the content is different
[07:36:25] <NoiseEee> so where's the issue?
[07:36:31] <NoiseEee> you're trying to append that table to the DOM?
[07:36:43] <coRz> hey need help: http://jsfiddle.net/rvV23/1/
[07:36:51] <gingitsune> I'm doing that just fine
[07:37:04] <gingitsune> Okay lets take a step back
[07:38:47] <gingitsune> so a have a field that determines which table are we looking at. The user goes into edit mode. A window pops up where user can edit the data. If he changes the category field. The table is redrawn instantly.
[07:39:02] <gingitsune> I want to append the edited field to the table
[07:39:17] <gingitsune> i have all the data needed to recreate a row
[07:40:21] <NoiseEee> gingitsune: and the issue is what?  sorry not really following
[07:40:54] <coRz> suggestions? http://jsfiddle.net/rvV23/1/
[07:41:03] <gingitsune> my function is not called for some reason
[07:41:09] <gingitsune> probably just a stupid mistake
[07:41:26] <gingitsune> just looking for a kick in the butt to get my brain cells moving :D
[07:42:53] <jomofcw> BillCriswell it doesn't work. But anyway, it's OK I find a way ^^. Thanks.
[07:43:14] <BillCriswell> jomofcw: Ok.
[07:45:14] <jomofcw> In fact, it works on Firefox but not on Chrome :/...
[07:46:28] <jomofcw> But, when I'm on facebook, I begin to write a status, then I try to hit my previous browser' button... then it stop me with a custom modal dialog that ask me if I really want to leave the page... how they do that oO ?!
[07:49:43] <TheWhisper> Hey, all
[07:49:51] <TheWhisper> I'm having some trouble with a variable on my site
[07:50:16] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/jiaa9cixuxmrgyv33jkyg - #placement_area is a hidden field. When it is changed I want to take action, but this doesn't seem to work.
[07:50:35] <TheWhisper> https://github.com/whispy/whispy.github.io/blob/master/js/custom.js#L61
[07:51:12] <TheWhisper> I'm trying to get the line 61 variable to select the clicked anchor and follow its URL.
[07:51:31] <TheWhisper> I've tried jquery('.imgDiv a'), jquery(this), jquery('a'), etc
[07:51:59] <TheWhisper> They only follow the first URL, even though the other anchors link to different URLs
[07:52:23] <Elrinth2> it's case sensitive
[07:52:25] <Elrinth2> jQuery
[07:52:37] <TheWhisper> I know
[07:52:44] <TheWhisper> I didn't capitalize it here, but it is in the code
[07:54:05] <Elrinth2> oh that one just takes the last a inside the .imgDiv
[07:54:07] <Elrinth2> not each
[07:54:16] <TheWhisper> I know
[07:54:22] <TheWhisper> Well, it takes the first a
[07:54:28] <TheWhisper> but it doesn't work with jQuery(this) either
[07:55:08] <Elrinth2> function loadPieces doesn't know what "this" is
[07:55:19] <TheWhisper> Elrinth2, the function that calls the loadPieces function is on line 86
[07:55:41] <TheWhisper> And the variable for that function (idThumbs) recognizes each anchor individually, like it should
[07:55:54] <Elrinth2> is the function called at all?
[07:56:02] <TheWhisper> Which one?
[07:56:06] <Elrinth2> the loadPieces() function
[07:56:09] <TheWhisper> Yes
[07:56:10] <TheWhisper> on line 89
[07:56:11] <Cork> TheWhisper: you need to send the clicked element from the click handler
[07:56:14] <Elrinth2> yes I see that
[07:56:23] <TheWhisper> Cork, what do you mean?
[07:56:24] <Elrinth2> but is it called?
[07:56:27] <Elrinth2> did you try an alert("hello") inside the function
[07:56:31] <TheWhisper> Yes, it is called
[07:56:37] <Cork> TheWhisper: line 89: 	loadPieces(this);
[07:56:43] <TheWhisper> hm
[07:56:52] <Cork> function loadPieces(target) {
[07:57:28] <Cork> var toLoad = $(target).attr('href') + ' #workDisplay .work '
[07:57:51] <Bloomberg> Hi guys
[07:58:09] <Bloomberg> hwat event will works for get the value of a select instead of change?
[07:58:11] <TheWhisper> Yes, that fixed it, Cork!
[07:58:14] <TheWhisper> Thanks!
[07:59:54] <SprkDev> I'm not sure what to do with this modal.
[08:00:50] <TheWhisper> Now, does anyone know how to make it so that when I link to a certain #, it displays that page instead of the main page?
[08:00:58] <TheWhisper> This is the site btw http://discoverdan.com/index_wip
[08:01:03] <joelones> Hey guys, I am using datatables and I am running a callback function after the table loads via the "fnDrawCallBack":, the function I'm running is loadModalLinks, please see here http://pastebin.com/A4DZ08wt. 1) I would like that every time an "X" is clicked for that row a modal window is presented prompting the user to confirm deletion of that object. Once deleted I would run the fnDraw (redraw method) on the datatable object to refre
[08:01:04] <joelones> the rows. 2) It does work for the first deletion, unfortunately every subsequent deletion it posts to the backend the previous deleted ones in an accumulative fashion
[08:01:17] <TheWhisper> And if I click on 'work', the #work is appended to the URL
[08:01:23] <TheWhisper> and the content for work shows
[08:01:29] <TheWhisper> but if I go to the http://discoverdan.com/index_wip#work directly
[08:01:31] <TheWhisper> it does not
[08:02:57] <ankurk_> TheWhisper: add href='#work'
[08:03:08] <TheWhisper> ?
[08:03:21] <TheWhisper> Where?
[08:03:54] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/jiaa9cixuxmrgyv33jkyg - #placement_area is a hidden field. When it is changed I want to take action, but this doesn't seem to work.
[08:04:48] <theShaz> I am having problem with css where I am using css to do a flip effect on a page. The problem is that the background for the back is not covering the full-screen it only cover were the content of the front content end. Code can be seen here:http://jsfiddle.net/7tcCh/7/
[08:05:18] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: I think that's it.
[08:05:39] <theShaz> I have post the question in css ch they said to ask it here because i am using jquery
[08:06:53] <ankurk_> TheWhisper: in your link
[08:07:11] <TheWhisper> So you're saying I should have two href tags?
[08:07:16] <TheWhisper> One to the .html file, and one to just #work?
[08:09:08] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: You're setting the height to the height of .front.
[08:09:22] <TheWhisper> Wrong person, BillCriswell :P
[08:09:34] <BillCriswell> theShaz: ^^
[08:09:40] <BillCriswell> TheWhisper: My bad!
[08:09:42] <TheWhisper> np
[08:09:55] <TheWhisper> I get mis-tab-completed a lot :P
[08:10:23] <ankurk_> just one href tag TheWhisper
[08:10:43] <TheWhisper> Then how will it know what page to load...
[08:10:50] <TheWhisper> It won't load the .html page
[08:10:50] <bristleback> how can I escape a json string passed as value in an input element when I try to serializeArray the form containing that element
[08:11:18] <theShaz> no
[08:11:26] <bristleback> so for example the input I'm talking about will have the value {"foo":"bar"}
[08:12:20] <SprkDev> why would my popover work when I load the page in single page, but the same thing doesnt work in mdaol
[08:13:04] <bristleback> and the object resulted from serializeArray will contain smth like; value: "{"foo": "bar"}"
[08:13:58] <BillCriswell> theShaz: No?
[08:15:07] <theShaz> TheWhisper: You're setting the height to the height of .front. <-- no to that
[08:15:51] <BillCriswell> bristleback: $('.flip-container .back').height($('.flip-container .front').height()); is what you have.
[08:16:18] <bristleback> BillCriswell: huh?
[08:16:26] <BillCriswell> theShaz: ^^ my bad lol
[08:16:31] <BillCriswell> I suck at IRC.
[08:16:51] <bristleback> BillCriswell: now you could give me an idea for my problem :d
[08:17:13] <theShaz> i can wait for brist problem to be fix this is get confussion really fast..
[08:17:40] <hooligan133> how to manipulate a psuedo selector like :after?
[08:17:42] <BillCriswell> theShaz: The code I posted sets the height of .back to .front.
[08:18:21] <BillCriswell> theShaz: Which is the code you have in there.
[08:19:07] <BillCriswell> Which is what you said "no" to.
[08:19:41] <BillCriswell> hooligan133: You'd need to change the element that generates it class.
[08:20:07] <BillCriswell> bristleback: Why do you have json in an input?
[08:20:09] <legolasbo> Is anyone here familliar with javascript/jquer for Drupal?
[08:20:59] <bristleback> :))))))
[08:22:20] <theShaz> @Billcriswell  sorry i was look at the css .front not the jS
[08:22:26] <bristleback> BillCriswell: because the values from the inputs are used to do some requests to an API, and that API has a parameter which needs to contain a json string
[08:23:19] <bristleback> I could ask for that API to be modified but I doubt this will happen since it is already used by all of our products
[08:23:21] <bristleback> :)
[08:23:32] <bristleback> so... I will have to stick with this design
[08:25:11] <BillCriswell> bristleback: Why does it need to be escaped?
[08:26:02] <hooligan133> BillCriswell hm specifically I want to get the height of psuedo class
[08:26:33] <hooligan133> but yeah actually nm i see it makes sense easier to just get the height of the original and calculate where it is relative
[08:26:40] <bristleback> BillCriswell: well... this form will be serialized and kept in an object; that object will be sent to a PHP script that will do a json_encode on it that it will save the value in a database
[08:27:15] <bristleback> when the user will get to that page again, the data will be loaded from the database and then assigned to a javascript variable
[08:27:45] <BillCriswell> hooligan133: That's set in CSS? There is a window.getComputerStyle(el, ':after').getPropertyValue('height') but it feels gross.
[08:27:57] <bristleback> but since the value loaded from the database is something like {"value": "{"foo":"bar"}"}
[08:28:04] <bristleback> it will fail with an error
[08:28:05] <bristleback> :)
[08:28:23] <hooligan133> if the glove fits i guess you have too wear it :/
[08:31:54] <BillCriswell> bristleback: You shouldn't have to worry about encoding things on the client side.
[08:32:15] <duch_kazatel> that's an interesting point to come into a conversation.
[08:33:21] <TheWhisper> Hey, duch_kazatel
[08:33:40] <duch_kazatel> whuddup duder
[08:33:47] <duch_kazatel> it's wednesday sirs.  it'll be a good day.
[08:33:50] <hooligan133> this is what im mucking with BillCriswell http://jsfiddle.net/n25hM/15/ .. lookin to those diamonds in the little discoball but if there was after:after or something I could just do the positioning fully in css and it would be kind of responsive
[08:33:59] <SprkDev> why would my popover work when I load the page in single page, but the same thing doesnt work in modal????
[08:34:03] <TheWhisper> Does anyone know how I can get # urls to work in terms of back button and when people go to the # url directly?
[08:34:14] <TheWhisper> on this site http://discoverdan.com/index_wip
[08:34:30] <duch_kazatel> SprkDev because it's not init'd on the modal content but is elsehwere?
[08:34:34] <duch_kazatel> *elsewhere.
[08:34:45] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper what exactly are you looking for?
[08:34:51] <duch_kazatel> just general hash management?
[08:34:55] <TheWhisper> duch_kazatel, yes
[08:34:58] <TheWhisper> I guess
[08:35:05] <SprkDev> how would I go about initialize it?
[08:35:11] <duch_kazatel> you can look at window.location.hash on pageload and go from there.
[08:35:28] <TheWhisper> duch_kazately, will that work for back button too?
[08:35:51] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper the hashchange event fires when it changes and the page doesn't reload.
[08:36:03] <duch_kazatel> the you'll have to do some extra work, but it's not too bad.
[08:36:18] <duch_kazatel> SprkDev dunno - depends on your lib.  init the popover on the content in the modal after you launch it maybe?
[08:36:37] <duch_kazatel> some modal libraries will do weird stuff when they copy content around to display it.
[08:40:20] <duch_kazatel> aaand it's dead.  looking forward to today.
[08:42:52] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Ha.
[08:44:01] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: https://github.com/mechio/takana Just started using this bad boy... So awesome.
[08:44:17] <duch_kazatel> oooh.
[08:44:35] <BillCriswell> It's like editing in dev tools, but with SASS and your text editor.
[08:44:43] <duch_kazatel> yeah i see this.
[08:44:46] <duch_kazatel> hrm....
[08:45:16] <BillCriswell> It uses libsass which isn't up to snuff with ruby's sass, but it's still pretty awesome.
[08:45:38] <duch_kazatel> we actually use compass here, oddly enough.
[08:46:09] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Ah, yeah. Don't think you're using compass with libsass anytime soon.
[08:46:17] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[08:46:22] <duch_kazatel> stil... liking it.
[08:46:23] <TheWhisper> duch_kazatel, what about https://github.com/georgekosmidis/jquery-hashchange
[08:47:07] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper you can do that, but it's not necessary at all.
[08:47:25] <TheWhisper> It seems like it has fallback compatibility though
[08:48:06] <duch_kazatel> how far back do you need to support?
[08:48:19] <TheWhisper> I mean
[08:48:33] <TheWhisper> A compromise between ease of implementation and as far back as I can would be nice :P
[08:48:53] <duch_kazatel> do you really need to support pre 8 IE?
[08:49:04] <TheWhisper> Probably not
[08:49:17] <TheWhisper> Not sure how to do it otherwise though
[08:49:19] <duch_kazatel> then you don't need the fallback.  history/hash management isn't really all that terrible.
[08:49:26] <joelones> Hey guys, I am using datatables (hope someone used it before) and I am running a callback function after the table loads via the "fnDrawCallBack":, the function I'm running is loadModalLinks, please see here http://pastebin.com/A4DZ08wt. 1) I would like that every time an "X" is clicked for that row a modal window is presented prompting the user to confirm deletion of that object. Once deleted I would run the fnDraw (redraw method) on
[08:49:27] <joelones> datatable object to refresh the rows. 2) It does work for the first deletion, unfortunately every subsequent deletion it posts to the backend the previous deleted ones in an accumulative fashion
[08:49:28] <TheWhisper> Not sure how to do it though
[08:49:39] <duch_kazatel> i'll show you a basic sample.
[08:51:05] <DerKirche> Hey folks -- any ideas why $.ajax() would stript script tags when the documentation says it shouldn't?
[08:52:50] <SprkDev> my library is bootstrap. I have tried everything. What works on single page doesn't work in modal. Its all boostrap.
[08:53:17] <duch_kazatel> SprkDev re-initialize after you launch the modal - try that.
[08:53:28] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper http://jsfiddle.net/Y3SsA/1/
[08:53:51] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper that doesn't necessarily work in a fiddle, but if you coppy that locally, you'll see the idea.
[08:53:57] <TheWhisper> yeah
[08:54:57] <TheWhisper> duch_kazatel, that looks like it only works on click though
[08:55:14] <TheWhisper> I already have it working on click
[08:55:15] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper okay.  let me take it a step further then.
[08:55:28] <TheWhisper> If you check discoverdan.com/index_wip
[08:55:30] <TheWhisper> you'll see
[08:56:39] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Y3SsA/6/
[08:56:47] <duch_kazatel> easy peasy.
[08:56:50] <duch_kazatel> just detect it on pageload.
[08:57:16] <TheWhisper> so I'd have to make an if statement
[08:57:19] <TheWhisper> for each hash?
[08:57:36] <duch_kazatel> or you could detect if there is a hash and go from there.
[08:57:44] <duch_kazatel> does the hash correspond with something?
[08:57:47] <TheWhisper> ...
[08:57:48] <TheWhisper> yes
[08:57:50] <TheWhisper> the pages
[08:57:56] <TheWhisper> Look at the site and you'll see
[08:58:01] <TheWhisper> :P
[08:58:12] <duch_kazatel> easy.
[08:58:22] <duch_kazatel> how are you loading each section?
[08:59:05] <duch_kazatel> btw menuItems.each(function(key) {  is unnecessary.
[08:59:11] <TheWhisper> .load
[08:59:11] <b-ot> TheWhisper: like an .get but with the possibility to choose section to load (like with anchor)
[08:59:18] <CrowX-> Cork, are you there?
[08:59:22] <frank_o> Is there a way to make jQuery Mobile's panel widget scroll using overflow scrolling (Overthrow.js)? -- http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/4Q8yb/
[08:59:30] <frank_o> Or is iScroll / iScrollView the only way? -- http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/8CVac/
[08:59:44] <frank_o> I see jQM has panel scrolling on the roadmap (http://jquerymobile.com/roadmap/) but that ain't until 1.7.
[08:59:56] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper so you can call that load with the data from the hash.
[09:00:52] <DerKirche> Hey folks -- any ideas why $.ajax() would stript script tags when the documentation says it shouldn't? - even with dataType set to html (which should execute scripts from the page)
[09:00:56] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell : man, are you there?
[09:01:05] <duch_kazatel> DerKirche jsfiddle please?
[09:01:28] <SprkDev> is initilizition simply $('myPopover').popover() ? Is this what you mean?
[09:01:41] <SprkDev> is initilizition simply $('#myPopover').popover() ? Is this what you mean?
[09:01:51] <duch_kazatel> SprkDev i do not know the particulars of your popover library.
[09:02:00] <duch_kazatel> SprkDev i'm just giving you a basic idea to try.
[09:02:18] <SprkDev> I've tried that already.
[09:02:55] <duch_kazatel> okay.  are you able to setup a basic jsfiddle demonstrating the problem, then?
[09:03:12] <NoiseEee> SprkDev: what do you even mean by "doesnt work in modal" anyways?
[09:04:11] <SprkDev> when I press the the button, the popover does not show up. But when I load the page without the modal it shows up. Bear in mind, that the code is 100% identical in both instance. Just on link opens it in modal, the othre in single page.
[09:04:32] <TheWhisper> duch_kazatel, since I have the original navigation hashing function based on the href of the clicked link
[09:04:32] <duch_kazatel> i'll bet one doesn't init the popover before the modal fires.
[09:04:43] <TheWhisper> I'm not sure how to get your method to play nice with that
[09:04:51] <hooligan133> http://jsfiddle.net/n25hM/18/ <-- woot now just to make it so the diamonds auto reposition them self
[09:05:14] <hooligan133> did you use the psuedo selector in the end bill ... just to ugly like you say
[09:05:36] <hooligan133> you can still be quiet accurate with out it which is the reason i cared
[09:06:17] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper or you could remove that IIFE surrounding the contents of FancyNav and just call fancyNav.loadCOntent() on pageload if there's a hash present.
[09:06:25] <TheWhisper> hm
[09:06:54] <TheWhisper> How would it know which hash corresponds though?
[09:06:58] <TheWhisper> var toLoad = $(this).attr('href') + ' .content ';
[09:07:04] <TheWhisper> is still based on the click event, no?
[09:07:26] <duch_kazatel> sure - looks like your href is the hash + _a
[09:07:53] <duch_kazatel> or you could change those hrefs and drop the _a
[09:08:24] <DerKirche> duch_kazatel: it's wrapped in a bunch of crazy minified/obsfucated code from my client - so a fiddle's kinda impractical - but from the looks of the object being used (as $.ajax(o)) the o object only has data, dataType, and url set :/
[09:08:44] <duch_kazatel> DerKirche showing us just the ajax snippet may be helpful.
[09:08:44] <TheWhisper> duch_kazatel, what would I change them to though?
[09:09:28] <duch_kazatel> what was the link again, TheWhisper?
[09:09:37] <duch_kazatel> because you're making this much harder than it needs to be.
[09:09:39] <TheWhisper> discoverdan.com/index_wip
[09:09:57] <TheWhisper> duch_kazatel, I'm not very good with jQuery, so even easy is hard for me :P
[09:10:38] <duch_kazatel> why do you have fancyNav set to an IIFE?
[09:11:16] <TheWhisper> I thought we talked about this the other day :P
[09:11:21] <TheWhisper> That's what my friend said to do
[09:11:33] <TheWhisper> He works at Behance as a coder
[09:11:40] <TheWhisper> so I figured he knew best
[09:11:45] <duch_kazatel> i talk to dozens of people each day - you can't expect me to remember every single person i talk to.
[09:13:38] <DerKirche> duch_kazatel: here's the relevant code: http://jsfiddle.net/7SHNj/ ... but this doesn't appear to run at all - probs due to missing the rest of the obsfucated file
[09:14:01] <DerKirche> oh - duh - they don't set jquery by default anymore :/
[09:14:06] <duch_kazatel> DerKirche that's fine.  seeing just the ajax is important.
[09:14:23] <DerKirche> http://jsfiddle.net/7SHNj/1/ ... me - still doesn't work
[09:14:27] <DerKirche> *meh
[09:14:35] <duch_kazatel> DerKirche err, wait you only have the obfuscated versio?
[09:14:40] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper almost done.  one sec.
[09:14:48] <DerKirche> duch_kazatel: yup
[09:15:04] <TheWhisper> k
[09:15:10] <DerKirche> my client is satan - I'm in hell.
[09:15:25] <johannes__> Hello, I use $(".whatever").click(function () { … }) to add a click event to an element. It works on Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Safari on iPad. But Safari on an iPhone 4 just ignores it
[09:15:51] <DerKirche> johannes__: change the click to on - and listen for "click touchend"
[09:16:23] <DerKirche> johannes__: like $(whatever).on("click touchend", function(){...});
[09:16:51] <Baluse> Hello
[09:17:17] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper window.location.hash = $(this).attr('href').substr(0, $(this).attr('href').length - 5); //append url - is this just so you can get the filename out of the href?
[09:17:19] <Baluse> Which is a good jquery library to use with <table> ? (to add sorting/filtering etc)
[09:18:15] <TheWhisper> Duch_kazately, that gets the filename from the HREF and appends it to the URL
[09:18:19] <johannes__> DerKirche: Thank you, I will try it
[09:18:19] <TheWhisper> *duch_kazatel
[09:18:33] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper easy peasy. .
[09:18:55] <TheWhisper> I took fancyNav out of the iife
[09:19:01] <TheWhisper> pushing it now
[09:19:40] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper you shoulda just done  $(this).attr('href').replace('.html', ''); instead of that substring dealio.
[09:19:49] <duch_kazatel> but we're going to make this even easier.
[09:20:21] <TheWhisper> If you refresh the site, I removed the iife from fancyNav
[09:21:28] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper http://jsfiddle.net/Ax6r7/
[09:21:30] <BillCriswell> "removed the life from" I like that.
[09:21:45] <TheWhisper> Haha, not an L, billcriswell :P
[09:21:46] <duch_kazatel> this will be closer to what you want.
[09:21:48] <TheWhisper> double i's
[09:22:05] <TheWhisper> hm
[09:22:07] <TheWhisper> Lemme take a look
[09:22:08] <duch_kazatel> what you had earlier was doing a lot of unnecessary enumeration to find things to bind to.  it was really awkward.
[09:22:51] <duch_kazatel> but that fixed your loadContent and bindListeners functions, though that bind dealio doesn't really need to be a separate function tbh.
[09:23:16] <CrowX-> is there a way I could get an element's max height with jquery?
[09:23:58] <duch_kazatel> the cool thing about this way is then, when you load the page, you can do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/Ax6r7/1/
[09:24:15] <HiMaX> is not possible to remove trailing comma from object key/value, if you want make array from the keys ? http://bpaste.net/show/196797/
[09:24:32] <TheWhisper> duch_kazatel, should this all be in document.ready?
[09:24:35] <BillCriswell> CrowX-: .css('max-height')
[09:24:41] <TheWhisper> or is it fine if I still have it in fancyNav outside of doc.ready
[09:24:46] <TheWhisper> and call fancyNav on doc.ready?
[09:24:49] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper the only things that need to be in doc ready are things that don't rely on content.
[09:24:54] <TheWhisper> okay
[09:25:10] <duch_kazatel> err, flip that - the only things that need to be in doc ready are things that DO rely on content.
[09:25:22] <TheWhisper> lol
[09:25:22] <duch_kazatel> HiMaX what are you trying to do?
[09:26:16] <HiMaX> duch_kazatel: i want make an Array from the keys of object
[09:26:27] <HiMaX> but cannot remove trailing comma
[09:26:34] <duch_kazatel> HiMaX an array, or just display the keys as a list of stuff?
[09:27:47] <HiMaX> duch_kazatel: as list with comma separated to put into sqlite database
[09:28:08] <duch_kazatel> HiMaX because this is how you'd craft a new array: http://jsfiddle.net/tkc9y/
[09:28:10] <TheWhisper> duch_kazatel, the toLoad variable becomes the hash only, and not the .html page
[09:28:12] <HiMaX> i just want remove the last comma
[09:28:21] <TheWhisper> Is there a way I can do like
[09:28:31] <duch_kazatel> TheWhisper that example was just that - you'll have to do the rest :)
[09:28:31] <TheWhisper> var toFetch = toLoad(+ .html)?
[09:28:33] <TheWhisper> or something?
[09:28:40] <duch_kazatel> sure - give it a shot ;)
[09:30:08] <HiMaX> duch_kazatel: thanks :)
[09:31:11] <duch_kazatel> brb
[09:35:05] <duch_kazatel> aaah i hate password change week.
[09:36:23] <TheWhisper> Can't figure out how to do it, duch_kazatel
[09:36:34] <TheWhisper> I got it to append .html to toLoad in toFetch
[09:36:46] <TheWhisper> but that still doesn't load the .html file
[09:36:53] <duch_kazatel> push it up and let me see.
[09:37:27] <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/vXJEIzL.png
[09:37:35] <duch_kazatel> wut.
[09:37:41] <duch_kazatel> to your page broseph.
[09:38:05] <duch_kazatel> pass toFetch to that .load() method instead.
[09:38:50] <TheWhisper> yup
[09:38:51] <TheWhisper> that did it
[09:38:58] <TheWhisper> thanks
[09:45:56] <FatDragon_> hi to community
[09:45:59] <FatDragon_> :)
[09:46:11] <FatDragon_> newbie here
[09:47:44] <duch_kazatel> hello.
[09:48:49] <TheWhisper> duch_kazately, still not sure how to get it to work if I go directly to the url with the #
[09:48:55] <TheWhisper> or on refresh
[09:49:20] <duch_kazatel> i gave you the if check in a fiddle earlier.
[09:49:34] <TheWhisper> Yeah, but do I just call fancyNav in the if?
[09:49:39] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Ax6r7/1/
[09:49:43] <TheWhisper> Because fancyNav is still based on a click
[09:50:03] <duch_kazatel> you need to expose your loadContent method somehow and call it.
[09:50:08] <duch_kazatel> how you do that is up to you.
[09:50:10] <TheWhisper> okay
[10:02:39] <TheWhisper> duch_kazatel, what does this line do: window.location.hash = toLoad
[10:05:05] <hooligan133> http://jsfiddle.net/n25hM/25/ <-- resizes now :)
[10:08:39] <decx> what the deuce is going on there
[10:10:00] <decx> ah, only looks good in chrome
[10:10:21] <hooligan133> yeah need to sort the prefixes
[10:12:24] <hooligan133> what did you look in decx?
[10:13:23] <decx> ff 25, the diamonds grow too big and the sun rays don't appear at all
[10:14:15] <hooligan133> yeah because thers no -moz-transform scale rules heheh
[10:14:28] <hooligan133> giaganto diamond
[10:15:04] <Soltis> What's a good way to do a little pop-up -- like a tooltip, but with more info -- when you hover over a given element?
[10:15:13] <decx> he grows giant diamonds, de beers hates him
[10:15:56] <decx> there are about 3000 tooltip jquery plugins, but it's a nice little objective to handroll something yourself
[10:16:34] <Soltis> I don't want to bother doing my own. Waste of time. What I want is a suggestion for one that works well.
[10:16:39] <Soltis> And can handle SVG
[10:17:14] <Soltis> Meaning, it won't freak out if it has to integrate with it somehow, assuming you're using a sane browser. IE can fuck itself.
[10:19:05] <hooliogan132> decx http://jsfiddle.net/n25hM/26/ that one should be more moz friendly
[10:20:00] <decx> you say it's a waste of time but depending on your requirements hacking away at an existing plugin that covers a billion usecases to be usable in any situation might take more time than making a succinct handrolled solution
[10:20:42] <duch_kazatel> weeee
[10:21:50] <duch_kazatel> what are we talking about?
[10:22:20] <duch_kazatel> oh, tooltip plugins - i'm fond of powertip.  a little big, but it generally works pretty well.
[10:22:37] <decx> hooliogan132 http://i.imgur.com/GK0MTiB.gif
[10:23:03] <hooliogan132>  HM
[10:25:21] <fonsA2> I'm currently working on a site which uses the javascript code below to animate over to the target element inside an href. How would I go about getting the code to animate when the back/forward buttons are clicked based on it's history.
[10:25:22] <fonsA2> http://pastebin.com/GwFFT2jh
[10:26:57] <hooliogan132> decx http://jsfiddle.net/n25hM/29/
[10:27:23] <duch_kazatel> fonsA2 you want to hook into pushstates
[10:27:24] <hooliogan132> if it dont work now that fox is going to get a beat down
[10:27:42] <duch_kazatel> fonsA2 but those are not supported in IE9 and below.
[10:28:00] <decx> yeah it stays inside the inner circle now hooliogan132
[10:29:02] <fonsA2> Thanks Duch. Will look into it.
[10:30:40] <hooligan133> thanks decx
[10:33:22] <decx> but if it isn't interactive i'd just use a spritesheet with a step animation or even a gif, not to curtail the work on the js and css you've done already :>
[10:36:47] <hooligan133> im playing with the idea of interfacing it to my  spectrum analyser and beat detector code ive built around jplayer & web audio
[10:37:32] <Baluse> I get this shit as theme
[10:37:33] <Baluse> http://www.antz.gr/test.asp
[10:37:36] <decx> in that case, i'd use canvas instead of markup but that's just because i have a hardon for canvas
[10:37:40] <Baluse> although i downloaded smoothness
[10:38:01] <hooligan133> i aperciate the advise tho .. if theres more efficent way to do something I am always all ears ... I did after all only start making that because i was trying to replicate some icon i saw lol
[10:38:12] <hooligan133> yep yep my spec a code uses canvas
[10:38:51] <LuckyBurger> Having some issues with $.get()... http://pastebin.com/E7jmhPDW ... Browsing to the constructed URL returns expected output. However using jquery results in the error being displayed. Thoughts ?
[10:38:52] <decx> i don't know how performant a markup based solution is when you feed it realtime data
[10:39:46] <frank_o> So Sven Franck of the jQM team gave me a possible solution on how to make jQM's panel widget scroll using overflow scrolling (Overthrow.js) -- http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/4Q8yb/4/
[10:39:57] <frank_o> "I would start into looking how to prevent `page-scroll`, when you detect a scroll in a scrollable "region" defined by overthrow. In codespeak, try to force the of mobile.pageContainer to available height (don't forget url bar) on scroll in region."
[10:40:15] <frank_o> Does anybody know what this means in layman's terms though? I'm confused.
[10:41:10] <robert0> constrain the height of the scrollable area.
[10:41:44] <frank_o> robert0: basically just set a fixed like you suggested the other day?
[10:42:13] <duch_kazatel> and check the pagescroll event and, if it's coming from within that container, prevent it maybe?
[10:42:18] <duch_kazatel> something like that.
[10:42:46] <frank_o> cool let see
[10:42:52] <caciavar> Ok, so getting the ID of a DOM element based on another DOM element like this: var notes_id = $this.attr("id");     var $parent = $( "#" + notes_id.substring(0,notes_id.length-6) );
[10:43:04] <caciavar> That all works
[10:43:54] <caciavar> What I'd like to do is a find and replace on the $parent DOM element, and have $parent reference the new DOM element with the replaced contents
[10:44:40] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: he mentioned forcing the height of mobile.pageContainer so i should set the page to the height of the panel while the panel is active? then when it's gone i reset the height or something like that?
[10:45:32] <frank_o> god this sounds awful maybe i should just use iscroll for the panel until 1.7 is released
[10:45:35] <caciavar> so BEFORE:  $parent = $("someid") and AFTER $parent = $("some_id_with_replaced_text")
[10:45:44] <duch_kazatel> frank_o that would probably be better ;)_
[10:45:54] <duch_kazatel> caciavar have a fiddle?
[10:45:55] <frank_o> hehe
[10:46:05] <caciavar> Sure, will make one
[10:46:28] <duch_kazatel> caciavar because you just have to select.  not sure what you're not doing.
[10:51:52] <hooligan133> decx I did it with the dancing green andriod robot that was all css/markup originally done in a "chrome experiment" .. hes pretty basic so its easy to just rotate his arms and make his eyes go bigger and smaller and his antenni's grow up and down to the beat of the music
[10:54:40] <decx> hooligan133 what do you use to "read" the beat?
[11:03:17] <decx> i just checked a project for a designer-turned-developer. and on a single micropage with no interactivity he used jquery, jquery mobile, jquery ui and 3 different plugins for a slideshow with 2 pictures and a lightbox
[11:03:36] <duch_kazatel> it's beautiful.
[11:03:57] <decx> this is how he approaches his projects: http://i.imgur.com/bv3vZKR.gif
[11:04:20] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[11:05:20] <hooligan133> lol
[11:05:29] <duch_kazatel> always the best.
[11:05:43] <hooligan133> decx webaudios api's analyser object
[11:06:26] <hooligan133> i made some code to scan with in a frequency range and get the loudest peak
[11:06:55] <CrowX-> is the following line valid?    $(current).css('height',100% - $('#caption').height());
[11:07:19] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- nope.
[11:07:32] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, how can I accomplish what I'm trying to then?
[11:07:35] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- what are you trying to do?
[11:07:36] <decx> css() doesn'T deal in percentages only in absolutes
[11:08:02] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- and you can't subtract a number from 100% - that's not even a thing unless it's a string.
[11:08:53] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, 'current' and $('#caption') are two elements stacked vertically. I would like to make $(current)'s height 100% minus the height of $('#caption')
[11:09:00] <decx> css('height',function(index,value){ do stuff with existing value; return value })
[11:09:28] <ocx> hi all, data-prefetch is called everytime the page is loaded completely?
[11:09:30] <CrowX-> i.e I would like $('#caption') to have its default height, but current's height to resize to fill the rest of their container
[11:09:44] <ocx> or is it only called whenthe user interacts with the element having data-prefetch
[11:09:50] <duch_kazatel> look at what decx pasted, CrowX-
[11:10:32] <DarkGhost> Hello everyone, I know this is a terrible way to try and get help but It's too hard to replicate teh data to put into something suc has jsfiddle. so here we go: http://beta.truedelta.com/enrollment-2.php if you go here and go to the enroll your car side and then fill out all of those select boxes until "model" based on this http://privatepaste.com/36519515b5 it should print out all of the options text but for some reason it
[11:10:32] <DarkGhost>  doesnt get the data... in console.log
[11:11:11] <CrowX-> decx, what's 'index' and 'value' in that example?
[11:11:36] <decx> index is the index, value is the value
[11:11:53] <decx> :D
[11:14:10] <decx> if your selector has 5 matches, then css will fire an implied each, index is the number of the matched element
[11:14:50] <duch_kazatel> oh god mootools.
[11:15:49] <duch_kazatel> somebody shoot me now.
[11:16:26] <decx> whatyearisit.jpg
[11:17:55] <duch_kazatel> seriously.  i have to figure out mootools event binding now.
[11:24:12] <legolasbo> Does anyone have any experience with javascript/JQuery in Drupal 7?
[11:24:25] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ legolasbo
[11:24:25] <b-ot> legolasbo: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:25:07] <legolasbo> I’m working on a Drupal 7 module which integrates the references_dialog module with entityreference and node_reference select widgets. I’m already able to show a dialog with a node add form which returns the title and node ID of the newly created node to a callback function when it closes. I also added an ajax onchange event which updates the form element whenever it changes which works whenever i change the form element manually. Howe
[11:25:08] <legolasbo> when i change the form element from within the dialog close callback the onchange event doesn’t trigger and I can’t seem to get it to trigger, not even with a form_element.change() or form_element.trigger(onchange).
[11:25:29] <ocx> or is it only called whenthe user interacts with the element having data-prefetch
[11:25:31] <ocx> hi all, data-prefetch is called everytime the page is loaded completely?
[11:25:55] <duch_kazatel> legolasbo how are you binding the event handlers?
[11:26:55] <legolasbo> I’m not sure since Drupal Form api is binding the event handler for the form element and the reference_dialog is binding the event handler for the dialog
[11:27:48] <duch_kazatel> legolasbo you need to find out what they're doing to bind the listeners.  it could be that they're binding to the node directly and not using delegation.
[11:27:54] <duch_kazatel> so you might have to manually re-bind.
[11:29:41] <legolasbo> duch_kazatel: I’m not sure how to check which way they are bound. the references_dialog adds very little javascript from which I’m not able to determine how it gets bound. Also I’m not sure how/where Drupal binds it.
[11:31:30] <duch_kazatel> legolasbo not sure what to tell you then.  that's likely your problem.
[11:32:06] <duch_kazatel> i am but a humble javascripter.  i know nothing about how drupal works.
[11:32:45] <legolasbo> Your responses tell me there are multiple ways to bind event handlers. Do you know of a way to see which way was used (by using a debugger)>
[11:32:45] <legolasbo> ?
[11:33:06] <duch_kazatel> there are directly bound and delegated listeners.
[11:33:17] <duch_kazatel> you'd have to search google for that one, but there are ways to do it.
[11:34:02] <lstefani> someone can open this: jqueryui.com/dialog/ ? and very if work 'cause here not open
[11:34:18] <lstefani> check'
[11:34:25] <legolasbo> duch_kazatel++
[11:34:37] <legolasbo> Thanks for your help, I’ll ask Google for more info ;)
[11:34:43] <duch_kazatel> lstefani what exactly are you looking for?
[11:34:56] <duch_kazatel> legolasbo sure.  sorry i can't be more like 'ha-ha here's the fix!"
[11:34:58] <lstefani> hello. this link jqueryui.com/dialog/ not open on here
[11:35:17] <duch_kazatel> lstefani the page opens.
[11:35:18] <legolasbo> Maybe next time
[11:35:20] <duch_kazatel> i see a dialog.
[11:35:51] <lstefani> ok maybe i have a problem in my network
[11:35:55] <lstefani> thank you!
[11:37:51] <duch_kazatel> how in the hell does mootools run it's event bindings?!  jesus christ this is bad.

[12:05:14] <Brycetron> I'd seriously appreciate it.
[12:05:19] <MikeD_> seriously
[12:05:34] <Brycetron> I already have margin: 0 auto; display: block.
[12:06:22] <DarkGhost> Hello everyone, I know this is a terrible way to try and get help but It's too hard to replicate teh data to put into something suc has jsfiddle. so here we go: http://beta.truedelta.com/enrollment-2.php if you go here and go to the enroll your car side and then fill out all of those select boxes until "model" based on this http://privatepaste.com/36519515b5 it should print out all of the options text but for some reason it
[12:06:22] <DarkGhost>  doesn't get the data... in console.log
[12:06:59] <BillCriswell> Stalkr_: It works in Chrome here... or do you mean outside of the fiddle it does not work in Chome?
[12:07:53] <Stalkr_> BillCriswell: I am sorry, I somehow linked the wrong fiddle. I meant http://jsfiddle.net/Et68V/51/
[12:08:14] <BillCriswell> Brycetron: Make a demo somewhere that you're more comfortable sharing.
[12:09:00] <BillCriswell> Stalkr_: This appears to be working.
[12:09:35] <Stalkr_> BillCriswell: Yes, the fiddle works fine, but non-fiddle doesn't https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2758513/Droplings/sketch/index.html
[12:09:49] <Stalkr_> It's the same code, just more boxes
[12:12:10] <BillCriswell> Stalkr_: Put your $('.box').hover(..) stuff into the document ready.
[12:12:34] <BillCriswell> What's happening is your script is trying to add the hover event to .box's before they're generated.
[12:13:01] <BillCriswell> Stalkr_: jsfiddle wraps the code in a document ready for you so you're technically waiting for the document to be ready twice in your fiddle.
[12:13:46] <BillCriswell> Stalkr_: Once that sinks in let me know and I can give you some more suggestions.
[12:14:38] <Stalkr_> That works, thank you
[12:15:18] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[12:15:38] <Stalkr_> I just started out with jQuery yesterday, so I still don't know all those small things
[12:15:55] <Stalkr_> but I would love some suggestions
[12:17:15] <ankurk_> Stalkr: Get familiar with basics of JS first
[12:17:20] <BillCriswell> Hm, if you're starting out then just keep at it. Learn at your own pace.
[12:17:35] <CrowX-> slideUp and slideDown resize my element in both height and width. How can I make it resize only height?
[12:17:40] <Stalkr_> I read most of Eloquent JavaScript as a primer
[12:17:58] <Stalkr_> but I will definitely explore JavaScript more at some point,
[12:18:17] <BillCriswell> CrowX-: I think animate({toggle: 'height'}) would do that.
[12:21:02] <DarkGhost> BillCriswell you're knowledgeable anyidea with my problem? it's  a stupid one I know that
[12:22:25] <Horacsio> please could anyone help me how to fadeout after load following page only? because I get an empty page in-between page transitions fadeout-blank-fadein http://jsfiddle.net/6K9SZ/128/
[12:23:44] <Horacsio> please?
[12:25:42] <DerKirche> patience
[12:25:55] <Horacsio> ok :)
[12:26:12] <DerKirche> so ... what are you trying to do?
[12:26:46] <Horacsio> ok I need to fadeout and fadein on any website link click
[12:27:12] <MikeD_> sounds like he wants to change the default behavior of browsers's interpage display
[12:27:45] <Horacsio> I managed with http://jsfiddle.net/6K9SZ/128/ but the behavior is to fadeout, load time=blankpage, then fadein
[12:28:01] <Horacsio> I need to fadeout only the next page is loaded!
[12:28:21] <Horacsio> so it can fadein in transition with clean
[12:28:21] <DerKirche> oh - so like - ajax in the next page, then when it's loaded fade that in?
[12:28:22] <BillCriswell> DarkGhost: You have to wait till the model select is populated before you can query those options.
[12:29:00] <Horacsio> ok... maybe, but I don't know how to use ajax
[12:29:49] <Horacsio> so that's not possible with jquery, right? I will need ajax?
[12:30:04] <DerKirche> jquery does ajax
[12:30:46] <DerKirche> brb
[12:31:38] <BillCriswell> DarkGhost: Ideally, your populate functions would return a promise, so you could do like populate( options ).done(function(result) { /* Now I can work with the options */ });
[12:33:11] <duch_kazatel> weee
[12:46:48] <Horacsio> I got out… I managed with http://jsfiddle.net/6K9SZ/128/ but the behavior is to fadeout, load time=blankpage, then fadein. I need to fadeout only when the next page is loaded, and when so, fade it in.
[12:51:24] <hooliogan132> hey decx some one made a working discoball and ive integrated it now check it out http://jsfiddle.net/n25hM/30/
[12:51:32] <hooliogan132> the pink particles look a bit doodey but i think its a bit more real looking now I'll have to think about making the diamonds rotate but i think thats going to be bit hard core i might just implant the styles from the twinkling diamond on the particles instead
[12:51:48] <hooliogan132> and its a interactive
[12:51:54] <hooliogan132> let me know how ff fairs
[12:53:37] <Horacsio> I got out… I managed with http://jsfiddle.net/6K9SZ/128/ but the behavior is to fadeout, load time=blankpage, then fadein. I need to fadeout only when the next page is loaded, and when so, fade it in.
[12:53:42] <Horacsio> thats awasome!
[12:54:33] <DarkGhost> BillCriswell can I done .done on any function? like I have that populateModel fucntion can i just add a .done on it? (i din't code this btw)
[12:55:49] <BillCriswell> DarkGhost: No.
[12:56:31] <DarkGhost> so how would I have to go aobut this? I thought forsure the populateModel would be done before I'm doing all that other stuff :(
[12:57:42] <DarkGhost> BillCriswell I could since that pouplateModel does a .getJson i could add a done in there... but then what? call  something?
[12:58:56] <BillCriswell> DarkGhost: You can return that, then you can take on a .done.
[12:59:26] <DarkGhost> return the $.getJson
[12:59:36] <BillCriswell> DarkGhost: so return $.getJSON( url, options, success ) { /* Wee */ });
[12:59:40] <BillCriswell> DarkGhost: Yes.
[12:59:49] <DarkGhost> oh okay.
[12:59:51] <DarkGhost> lets see
[13:00:57] <BillCriswell> You could do the log of the item inside the success from the $.getJSON though, not sure what your deadlines look like.
[13:03:27] <DarkGhost> deadlines? not sure waht you mean
[13:03:49] <DarkGhost> log of the item/
[13:04:55] <Horacsio> some one please?
[13:06:01] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio what's up?
[13:06:40] <Horacsio> oh my friend,… I need to fadeout and fadein pages, I managed with http://jsfiddle.net/6K9SZ/128/ but the behavior is to fadeout, load time=blankpage, then fadein. I need to fadeout only when the next page is loaded, and when so, fade it in.
[13:06:53] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell i feel like we should start a blog about pragmatic frontend development.
[13:07:08] <duch_kazatel> how are you loading the next page, Horacsio?
[13:07:27] <Horacsio> I just click a link
[13:07:33] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio you can't do that.
[13:07:39] <Horacsio> what you mean?
[13:07:46] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio you'd have to ajax in the new content and do everything in the done() callback.,
[13:08:24] <Horacsio> I dont’  know how to use ajax… :(
[13:08:40] <Horacsio> is there a plugin, a tutorial,… something?!
[13:08:42] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio you can't make the browser wait to load the next page the way you want without like that.
[13:08:47] <duch_kazatel> jqueyr makes ajax very simple.
[13:08:48] <duch_kazatel> *jquery
[13:08:59] <Horacsio> how? :(
[13:09:10] <duch_kazatel> http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[13:09:49] <DarkGhost>   var finished = populateModel(0);                  finished.done(function() {  something like that? BillCriswell
[13:10:01] <Horacsio> there’s this: http://jquery-plugins.net/loadie-js-lightweight-jquery-loader-plugin but how to apply with that code?
[13:10:41] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio that involves using ajax.
[13:10:52] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio you're going to need to learn ajax to move forward.
[13:11:00] <Horacsio> how do I apply ajax?
[13:11:08] <duch_kazatel> read this: http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[13:11:27] <blognewb> hey guys is there a term for that 3 horizontal bar icon that is ubiquitously adapted in website uis lately? Menu icon?
[13:11:48] <duch_kazatel> blognewb yep - some folks also affectionaly call it the "hamburger icon"
[13:12:12] <blognewb> duch_kazatel, they seem to slow down performance = JANK is what it's called I just learned today?
[13:12:22] <duch_kazatel> blognewb huh?
[13:12:33] <blognewb> Is there a way to implement this without making the web page so damn bloated
[13:12:36] <duch_kazatel> slow down performance in regards to...?
[13:13:01] <blognewb> duch_kazatel, browsing
[13:13:07] <blognewb> lagged scrolling
[13:13:18] <systemfault> blognewb: So.. using an icon with 3 horizontal bars slowdown a website?
[13:13:19] <duch_kazatel> blognewb not following.  adding an icon to the page doesn't hurt performance on its own.
[13:13:31] <systemfault> blognewb: What about an icon with 4 bars?
[13:13:32] <duch_kazatel> blognewb so perhaps you can clarify what you're talking about.
[13:13:43] <blognewb> duch_kazatel, all the stuff that comes with it
[13:13:52] <duch_kazatel> blognewb only if you do it wrong.
[13:14:09] <blognewb> duch_kazatel, like huffington post's website it's so bloated and slow
[13:14:18] <duch_kazatel> that's not a function of the nav.
[13:14:32] <duch_kazatel> the nav does not create poor performance.
[13:14:52] <blognewb> or this page http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/03/holyoke_woman_sick_with_cancer.html
[13:14:58] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[13:15:00] <duch_kazatel> masslive.
[13:15:04] <duch_kazatel> don't worry about them.
[13:15:35] <duch_kazatel> advance internet's staff has a lot of other things to fix before they can take care of that.
[13:15:36] <blognewb> duch_kazatel, is there a guide for jquery somewhere to avoid bloating? jank? and still be able to implement this nav system
[13:16:00] <duch_kazatel> to implement a nav icon like that?
[13:16:26] <duch_kazatel> dunno if there's a comprehensive guide, but it'd be plenty easy to do.
[13:16:55] <duch_kazatel> fun fact: i worked at a company that was a vendor for advance internet, which runs that site, and is a sister company to reddit.
[13:17:49] <blognewb> reddit = conde nast or pre aqcuisition?
[13:18:18] <duch_kazatel> reddit got moved up the org structure.
[13:18:26] <duch_kazatel> they're a sister to conde nast now, as well.
[13:19:22] <mdhopkins> i'm having a terrible time debugging where some events are firing (iframes are involved) -- anyone know of a script that performantly logs every click event and bubble up on each element? i.e., not just document/window/body.
[13:19:49] <duch_kazatel> mdhopkins check out visual event?  that should help.
[13:20:02] <Horacsio> duch_kazatel: I will need to load all pages first, right?
[13:20:52] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio huh?  no.
[13:20:57] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio not if you use ajax.
[13:22:01] <mdhopkins> duch_kazatel: wow, thank you so much! this is extremely helpful. :)
[13:22:14] <duch_kazatel> mdhopkins i don't need it often, but it's a fantastic tool.
[13:23:32] <Horacsio> from what I’ve understood ajax methods are already embeded in jquery, right?
[13:23:51] <DerKirche> yes
[13:23:54] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio jquery abstracts them, yes.  go read the uide.
[13:23:57] <duch_kazatel> *guide
[13:26:06] <Horacsio> I’m reading it
[13:29:17] <Stalkr_> How do I make jQuery "ready" again? I empty a div container, then I fill it up again, but now hover won't work
[13:31:13] <jab3z> Hi. Is it possible to store $.when in a variable  and when I recall the function  after the one $.when it's waiting to call $.when again? It's like using $.when recursively.
[13:32:08] <kevin> hey guys. so i am making an ajax request that returns XML but i need it converted to JSON. I've tried "dataType: 'json'" and it fails because it's trying to convert text -> json... is there a way i can do xml -> json automatically? like, maybe chain the response converters or something
[13:32:23] <ZeroBeholder> I think I am using setTimeout wrong http://jsfiddle.net/CnZ9S/59/ ~line 252 of the javascript
[13:33:42] <ZeroBeholder> kevin: what is the language of the API you are using-- what language are you posting to?
[13:33:47] <kevin> well, the response *is* valid XML, but for some reason jquery thinks it's text. so is there some way i can force it to know that it is valid xml?
[13:34:32] <kevin> ZeroBeholder, it's some proprietary web service that just returns xml, and i would like it to be in json so i can easily use it in my webapps
[13:34:47] <ankurk_> I am trying to set text in a span, but I want to exclude the h5 tag, how would I do it? I tried using :not selector but no avail :(
[13:34:49] <ZeroBeholder> kevin: does the xml you are getting have the initial xml declaration at the top?
[13:35:06] <kevin> like the "<?xml>" etc etfc? no
[13:35:22] <ZeroBeholder> kevin: yes, is it there?
[13:35:27] <kevin> it is not
[13:35:38] <ZeroBeholder> Can you prepend one?
[13:35:52] <Horacsio> this is to damn hard for me to figure out :(
[13:35:53] <jab3z> kevin: xml is supported since 1.5 https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:36:34] <ZeroBeholder> That may help. I usually do my XML manipulation in PHP because I am a set im my ways fuddy duddy.
[13:37:06] <jab3z> Is it possible to store $.when in a variable  and when I recall the function  after the one $.when it's waiting to call $.when again? It's like using $.when recursively.
[13:37:52] <ZeroBeholder> Kevin: Otherwise you may be just shoving tags at it hoping via kind baked in magic that jQuery just guesses it is XML.
[13:38:05] <kevin> ZeroBeholder, thought it would figure it out from the Content-Type text/xml
[13:38:39] <ZeroBeholder> Can you jsbin what a typical API response looks like?
[13:39:42] <Voyage_> hi
[13:39:51] <Voyage_> whats wrong in this small snippet ?
[13:39:52] <Voyage_> http://pastie.org/8989670
[13:40:52] <jab3z> Voyage_: I guess after val you should add ()
[13:40:57] <DarkGhost> got it BillCriswell  thanks so much
[13:41:44] <Voyage_> hm
[13:41:46] <shoky> Voyage_: also you can only call .preventDefault() on the event passed as argument
[13:41:56] <shoky> .click(function(event) { event.preventDefault() ..
[13:42:21] <shoky> though form submits are better handled with submit event on the form element
[13:42:22] <ZeroBeholder> Voyage_:http://jsfiddle.net/F3uLt/1/
[13:42:25] <Voyage_> am.. the form is being submitted. what event should I catch
[13:42:27] <Voyage_> ZeroBeholder,  ok
[13:43:06] <ZeroBeholder> Voyage_: At least I think that stuff is a comment...
[13:43:14] <jab3z> Voyage_: submit event.
[13:43:58] <mdhopkins> okay, visual event hasn't been quite as useful as I thought. :) anything to show what events are being actually triggered? my issue is that the event isn't triggering on the element that supposedly is being clicked.
[13:44:43] <BillCriswell> No problem! Sorry something snuck up on me end of the day.
[13:44:52] <Voyage_> ZeroBeholder,  what change did you made else than s/val/val() ?
[13:45:15] <ZeroBeholder> I think I am using setTimeout wrong http://jsfiddle.net/CnZ9S/59/ ~line 252 of the javascript. For whatever reason, I think the code is flying through the loops and ends prematurely without any delays once the (initially hidden) start button is clicked
[13:45:18] <Voyage_> shoky,  jab3z  how to catch submit even?
[13:45:26] <Voyage_> :http://jsfiddle.net/F3uLt/1/
[13:45:40] <shoky> Voyage_:  $('#form').on('submit', function(event) { ... event.preventDefault(); ... })
[13:45:56] <Voyage_> hm
[13:46:23] <ZeroBeholder> Voyage_: see the /* and */ those are the multi-line comment syntax for around comment text
[13:46:50] <kevin> ZeroBeholder, sorry was reading the docs. just saw that dataType can be "multiple, space-separated values" ... so i just used "text xml json" and that works fine
[13:47:12] <shoky> ZeroBeholder: setTimeout(read, 5000);
[13:47:18] <ZeroBeholder> Voyage_: Also, don't forget to hit update at the top, we can't see your changes until you do.
[13:48:12] <Voyage_> ZeroBeholder,  dont you think i need .on('submit', function(event) { ... event.preventDefault(); ... })
[13:48:30] <ZeroBeholder> Voyage_: The link will change to /F3uLt/2/
[13:48:57] <ZeroBeholder> I just fixed the first things I saw that were what I guessed were bad syntax.
[13:50:50] <Voyage_> ZeroBeholder,  ok
[13:51:20] <Voyage_> shoky,  jab3z  ZeroBeholder  no matter if the file is chosen or not. the if(!$('#file').val()){ always evaluates to true
[13:51:48] <shoky> who said .val() tells you if there's a file chosen or not
[13:53:26] <jab3z> Voyage: one question though. Why are you not going with JQuery form validation plugin?
[13:54:18] <Voyage_> jab3z,  am. good question. i never knew there was a jquery validation plugin. secondly, I only need to check one field. by the way you have a link to that ?
[13:54:23] <shoky> well so .val() does tell you that
[13:54:26] <Voyage_> shoky,  then how will it check?
[13:54:55] <Voyage_> shoky,  it does? then why   no matter if the file is chosen or not. the if(!$('#file').val()){ always evaluates to true
[13:55:03] <jab3z> Voyage_: http://jqueryvalidation.org/
[13:55:09] <ZeroBeholder> Voyage_: There is a benefit to using a bonafide "submit" button instead of some other button or element and maybe a .click event handler (or as you asked a .on('click', handler). However, you will need a prevent default as you have identified.
[13:56:59] <shoky> Voyage_: works for me, http://jsfiddle.net/Mm9XA/
[13:57:52] <ZeroBeholder> +1 to jqueryvalidation to stop harmless carelessness and oversights. Still need some back end validation/sanitization to stop intentional badness.
[13:57:54] <ankurk_> So I am using this animate.css, I want to remove a element but it doesn't do it with animation, $divWithItemId.addClass('animated bounceOutLeft').remove();
[13:58:36] <shoky> cause .remove() removes immediately
[13:58:58] <Voyage_> shoky,  jab3z  ZeroBeholder  I wonder then why it does not in this form http://jsfiddle.net/F3uLt/2/
[13:59:21] <shoky> Voyage_: because that is all wrong..
[13:59:31] <ankurk_> shoky: so what can I do instead?
[13:59:46] <shoky> Voyage_: you're adding an event listener inside an event listener..
[13:59:56] <ankurk_> If I don't do remove() it just creates an empty space
[14:00:12] <ZeroBeholder> shoky: thanks, stupid rookie mistake. It's crap like this that makes me think I should stick with the backend security/db stuff I am best at.
[14:00:32] <shoky> ankurk_: i don't know, i don't use that css thing
[14:00:46] <ankurk_> but it's just an animation after all
[14:00:53] <shoky> not a jquery animation
[14:01:12] <shoky> as far as jquery's concerned it's just a class you added
[14:01:56] <ankurk_> hmm
[14:02:21] <ankurk_> So baseline is if I want to remove with animation, I am better off without animate,css
[14:02:42] <Voyage_> shoky,  looks good now? http://jsfiddle.net/F3uLt/3/
[14:02:59] <shoky> Voyage_: your form id is wrong
[14:03:17] <shoky> Voyage_: oh oops nevermind
[14:03:22] <jab3z> Voyage_: http://jsfiddle.net/F3uLt/4/
[14:03:40] <shoky> Voyage_: ok well it works, so yeah that's good
[14:04:03] <shoky> jab3z that's not what he wanted, i think
[14:04:03] <Voyage_> shoky,  so we cant have a listner inside another listner?
[14:04:17] <shoky> Voyage_: you can, but it usually doesn't make sense
[14:04:29] <shoky> made no sense to add a submit handler inside a click handler here...
[14:04:35] <jab3z> Voyage_: yes, but you should not prevent it then.
[14:05:06] <Voyage_> shoky,  hm
[14:05:09] <Voyage_> jab3z,  hm
[14:05:13] <shoky> Voyage_: and things that make no sense will usually not do what you want them to do
[14:05:18] <Voyage_> jab3z,  thanks. mine worked too. I got you logic
[14:09:28] <ZeroBeholder> Voyage_: Are you french or italian?
[14:10:01] <Baluse> azis .
[14:10:02] <ZeroBeholder> Voyage_: American English spells attach without an 'e' on the end.
[14:10:02] <Baluse> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjSgQFcpLqo
[14:10:48] <ZeroBeholder> I don't know about British English, maybe it has an e...
[14:10:52] <ilhami> hey
[14:10:55] <ilhami> anybody here?
[14:11:01] <ZeroBeholder> Nope.
[14:11:15] <ZeroBeholder> What's up?
[14:11:17] <ilhami> jquery is not loading.
[14:11:24] <ZeroBeholder> That is terrible.
[14:11:28] <ilhami> wait
[14:11:30] <ilhami> I will give you a pastebin
[14:11:32] <ZeroBeholder> Ok.
[14:12:26] <ilhami> ZeroBeholder: http://pastebin.com/PNDSr4Fy
[14:14:29] <ilhami> do you see anything wrong with it?
[14:16:32] <ilhami> brb
[14:17:00] <ZeroBeholder> I am looking at it, are you wanting all of this at $(document).ready () { ?
[14:17:11] <ZeroBeholder> Or is it triggered later by something?
[14:18:56] <Horacsio> could someone help me?
[14:19:21] <Horacsio> I need to fadeout and fadein pages, I managed with http://jsfiddle.net/6K9SZ/128/ but the behavior is to fadeout, load time=blankpage, then fadein. I need to fadeout only when the next page is loaded, and when so, fade it in.
[14:19:56] <ZeroBeholder> ilhami: I may be too inexperienced to help. I usually start my code with that $(document).ready event. Everything looks fine for the jquery and jqueryui.
[14:26:06] <ZeroBeholder> Horacsio: I think your issue is rooted in preloading-- your implementation looks neat.
[14:27:25] <ZeroBeholder> Horacsio: So, I don't know if you'll hook into a preloading library like http://www.createjs.com/#!/PreloadJS in conjunction on a forEach or... but, good luck man.
[14:27:50] <Horacsio> yes, but how do I preload the pages? I’m here loosing myself…
[14:29:33] <ZeroBeholder> Horacsio: I have no association with any preloader free/paid/otherwise. I would get an array of the elements you have already picked and feed them one by one (or as a group if allowed) into the preloading function.)
[14:30:02] <hooliogan132> Horacsio look at jquerys .load
[14:31:29] <ZeroBeholder> hooligan, Horacsio: .load() then DOM manipulation seems like a winner.
[14:32:14] <hooliogan132> k lol @ tv.. now some chick who had a bear as her pet all easting spaggetti bolognese with it at the dinner tabel .. crazy old bat!
[14:32:56] <ZeroBeholder> Horacsio: I'd be careful though, a lot of links could make a single page get heavy quick hockeystick growth style.
[14:33:46] <ZeroBeholder> Horacsio: Your code grabs all of them and converts them from the get go.
[14:34:08] <ZeroBeholder> Gotta go, thanks for the help.
[14:36:03] <Horacsio> thank you ZeroBeholder
[14:52:19] <Voyage_> shoky,  jab3z  thanks (I got disconnected)
[14:52:33] <jab3z> Voyage_: np :)
[15:03:21] <ilhami> http://fpaste.org/91114/39647611/ what's wrong here?
[15:03:30] <ilhami> It looks like jquery won't load.
[15:03:56] <duch_kazatel> ilhami what's the error?
[15:04:05] <ilhami> ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[15:04:05] <ilhami>       
[15:04:05] <ilhami> $(function() {
[15:04:18] <ilhami> line 11
[15:04:40] <ilhami> but I think jquery is not loading because my design looks like plain html
[15:04:48] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:05:12] <ilhami> but you see it's not loading.
[15:05:27] <duch_kazatel> let me fiddle it for you.
[15:06:09] <ilhami> thanks :)
[15:06:57] <duch_kazatel> you're missing a closing paren on line 13 of that paste.
[15:08:18] <ilhami> yeah but I fixed that
[15:08:31] <ilhami> it still doesn't work
[15:08:38] <duch_kazatel> (fiddle it ;))
[15:09:01] <ilhami> you said you would do it :D
[15:09:17] <duch_kazatel> i was kidding - didn't come accross that way.
[15:09:19] <duch_kazatel> please do it.
[15:09:46] <ilhami> ok brb
[15:09:49] <ilhami> need to go for a while :D
[15:09:54] <ilhami> will do it in half an hour or something
[15:11:25] <jim_j> hi
[15:11:31] <decx> you i in id isn't an i ilhami
[15:11:44] <decx> it's a í
[15:12:04] <jim_j> is there any way to do a jQuery("#myid").  to match the id myidtop and myidbottom?
[15:12:20] <jim_j> like a wildcard
[15:12:27] <duch_kazatel> jim_j sure, but don't do it.
[15:12:33] <jim_j> why?
[15:12:42] <decx> $('#myidtop,#myidbottom') will be more efficient than a wildcard
[15:12:45] <duch_kazatel> because it'll be slow and awkward
[15:12:47] <duch_kazatel> ^ do that.
[15:12:55] <jim_j> ohhh, awesome, thanks guys!!
[15:13:06] <duch_kazatel> welp.
[15:13:14] <decx> because with a wildcard, all elements have to be checked for this attribute, with id it's just getelementbyid
[15:13:57] <jim_j> got it
[15:17:13] <kongthap> hi, if my text input's id = input[x][y], how can i get value x, y out using jquery ?
[15:18:11] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.getAttribute
[15:20:28] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, i meant, if console.log(this.id) return input[2][1] i like to var first=2, var second=1 but i don't know how to get the 2,1 out of this.id
[15:22:09] <duch_kazatel> kongthap have an actual example?
[15:23:04] <ilhami> it works now somehow :D
[15:25:18] <ilhami> decx thanks
[15:25:25] <ilhami> I didnt see that little detail :D
[15:26:49] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, http://pastie.org/8989915
[15:27:15] <duch_kazatel> kongthap in a fiddle, please.
[15:27:22] <duch_kazatel> and why are you doing this with javascript, not jquery?
[15:28:08] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, i kind of don't know what to use, i will post to fiddle please wait
[15:28:16] <duch_kazatel> i'll do it.
[15:28:18] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[15:28:26] <duch_kazatel> *you said to not use jquery - why?
[15:30:26] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/avb98/
[15:30:35] <duch_kazatel> because that's one way to do it.
[15:33:48] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/jeud/25rLa/1/
[15:34:08] <duch_kazatel> kongthap jsfiddle.net/avb98/
[15:34:33] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, i just don't know the jquery way, so came up like this
[15:34:47] <duch_kazatel> kongthap you're using jquery in there.
[15:35:18] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/25rLa/2/
[15:35:19] <duch_kazatel> done.
[15:36:09] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, i use jquery for selector, but what about looping like what i wish, i don't know how can i get x,y out of txt_bet[x][y]
[15:36:31] <duch_kazatel> dude it's in there - did you even look at what i did?
[15:36:42] <duch_kazatel> theTextBet = $(this).attr('id').match(/\[\d+\]/g);
[15:37:13] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, i'm looking but don
[15:37:25] <duch_kazatel> what don't you understand?
[15:37:28] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, i'm looking but don't understand yet, i must try putting them into my coding
[15:38:26] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, i guess you already answer my question but i have to use your code so i can understand your code
[15:38:28] <kongthap> thanks
[15:38:38] <duch_kazatel> kay
[15:46:24] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, match() is javascript function not jquery right?
[15:46:30] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[15:46:48] <duch_kazatel> !g mdn match
[15:46:49] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: String.prototype.match() - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match

[15:48:42] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, is mdn the recommend site for javascript documentation? i really don't know about this
[15:48:54] <duch_kazatel> yes, it is.
[15:49:27] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, thanks :)
[15:51:39] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, regexp of apache, javascript are they the same thing? for now i only know "regexp" from these two
[15:52:39] <duch_kazatel> very similar.
[15:53:57] <iSDP> could someone help me with scraping data from another page in jQuery? i'm attempting to build a Smart TV app
[15:54:32] <duch_kazatel> iSDP how are you planning on doing that?
[15:55:11] <iSDP> duch_kazatel, no clue
[15:56:03] <duch_kazatel> then why are you saying "in jquery"?
[15:56:56] <ilhami> don't scrape data. that can be a pain in the ass.
[15:57:17] <ilhami> especially from websites
[15:57:20] <__joshua__> thats helpful
[15:57:24] <duch_kazatel> lol
[15:57:40] <duch_kazatel> if you can avoid scraping, do so.  but there are totally legit times to do it.
[15:57:43] <__joshua__> so iSDP, what are you using to scrape?
[15:58:03] <iSDP> http://pastebin.com/DrEH6AYJ i want the url: <h2 class="entry-title"><a href="http://watchwrestling.ch/home/watch-wwe-raw-33114/" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to Watch WWE RAW 3/31/14">Watch WWE RAW 3/31/14</a></h2>
[15:58:17] <iSDP> it's an app for home use
[15:58:37] <__joshua__> $('.entry-title').html()?
[15:58:57] <iSDP> joshua, there are multiple instances...
[15:58:57] <duch_kazatel> $('.entry-title a').attr('href');
[15:59:00] <duch_kazatel> if you want the href.
[15:59:06] <iSDP> http://watchwrestling.ch/wwe/
[15:59:11] <duch_kazatel> then enumerate through them using .each or a loop.
[15:59:11] <__joshua__> you want all instances?
[15:59:16] <ilhami> :D wrestling sucks
[15:59:24] <iSDP> only the RAW ones
[16:00:09] <__joshua__> $('.entry-title a:contains("RAW")').map(function(){ return $(this).html();} );
[16:00:53] <ilhami> __joshua__ nice :D
[16:00:58] <ilhami> you are very fast.
[16:01:06] <iSDP> heh =] but yeah, i want the href's attached to buttons... that's the point...
[16:01:12] <__joshua__> im scraping stuff right now ;p
[16:01:41] <__joshua__> $('.entry-title a:contains("RAW")').map(function(){ return $(this).attr('href');} );
[16:02:03] <iSDP> should i rather do something else?
[16:02:13] <ilhami> why?
[16:02:16] <iSDP> than scrape?
[16:02:19] <ilhami> he just gave you a solution :D
[16:02:33] <ilhami> yeah I would not scrape. What if the site changes or something like that?
[16:02:37] <__joshua__> i just tried it on the site.  works
[16:02:46] <duch_kazatel> yeah, just give up instea.d  don't do anything.
[16:02:48] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[16:02:54] <duch_kazatel> if they offer a feed of some kind, use that instead.
[16:02:56] <BillCriswell> I hate the word "mature".
[16:02:57] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, match(/[[t]/g) will match any "t" what about match any "[" ?
[16:03:12] <duch_kazatel> kongthap no, it won't.
[16:03:20] <BillCriswell> I always said "machure" so when someone says it right I think they just sound like an asshole.
[16:03:20] <iSDP> duch_kazatel, they don't offer a feed...
[16:03:23] <ilhami> regular expressions in jquery ? :D
[16:03:27] <ilhami> is it possible?
[16:03:29] <duch_kazatel> !mdn regexp
[16:03:29] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: RegExp - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp
[16:03:30] <__joshua__> no
[16:03:30] <kongthap> *match(/[t]/g)
[16:03:31] <__joshua__> no
[16:03:31] <__joshua__> no
[16:03:35] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:03:36] <__joshua__> dude, just do $('.entry-title a:contains("RAW")').map(function(){ return $(this).attr('href');} );
[16:03:36] <ilhami> oh ok :)
[16:03:47] <BillCriswell> This is sounding like fun.
[16:04:05] <ilhami> haha scraping pages with reg exp is a pain :D
[16:04:19] <duch_kazatel> ilhami that's not what kongthap is doing.
[16:04:23] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, i'm reading the doc but don't know how to match "[" it like reserve word for pattern
[16:04:27] <ilhami> didn't say he did :D
[16:04:52] <duch_kazatel> kongthap escape it - \[
[16:05:08] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, ok ok :P
[16:05:14] <duch_kazatel> read the docs.
[16:05:14] <__joshua__> match(/[[]/)
[16:05:27] <duch_kazatel> or do that.
[16:05:31] <duch_kazatel> jesus that's scary.
[16:06:12] <duch_kazatel> kongthap please tell me you have control over the backend and can add like data attributes or something to those instead.
[16:06:14] <BillCriswell> I'd rather spend 3 hours trying to avoid a regex than 20 minutes writing one lol
[16:06:35] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, i have php as backend
[16:06:39] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell yeah, regex in js usually means "i didn't want to figure out the right way in my backend"
[16:07:25] <duch_kazatel> kongthap use data attributes and fetch data from those instead of parsing out your ID.
[16:07:28] * __joshua__ '[asdft]'.match(/[[t]+/g)
[16:07:29] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, i expect the build this array("animal" => 0, "color" => 1, "qty" => 10) and convert to json then post the php backend
[16:07:47] <BillCriswell> Oh I remember this now.
[16:08:13] <duch_kazatel> kongthap great - attach data attributes instead.
[16:08:34] <duch_kazatel> or have some big old ugly object sitting around somewhere you can reference.
[16:08:43] <duch_kazatel> do anything other than regexing out that data from your ID.
[16:08:48] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, hehe sorry some little example please
[16:08:58] <duch_kazatel> data-animal="0"
[16:09:02] <duch_kazatel> that's a data attribute.
[16:09:36] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, i can have both data-animal, data-color right?
[16:09:43] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[16:09:48] <kongthap> in one <input>
[16:10:14] <duch_kazatel> here's an article from resig about it: http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/
[16:10:19] <duch_kazatel> google is a great resource :)
[16:11:08] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, if target php array like array("animal" => 0, "color" => 1, "qty" => 10) the javascript array should look like arr[0][0] = 10 and so on ?
[16:11:33] <kongthap> *array[0][1]=10
[16:12:16] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[16:12:42] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, i meant i don't get how to construct javascript array for later convert to php array or json
[16:13:05] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, in the expected form
[16:13:20] <kongthap> *in the expected format
[16:13:32] <duch_kazatel> kongthap you're very confused about objects, arrays, etc.]
[16:13:37] <duch_kazatel> i'd go read up.
[16:14:41] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, in my case i would need js object instead of array?
[16:14:53] <duch_kazatel> arrays ARE objects ;)
[16:15:07] <__joshua__> my_object = {animal: 0, color: 1, qty: 10};
[16:15:08] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, hehe
[16:15:18] <__joshua__> arrays are a special object
[16:15:25] <kongthap> i have really poor background :(
[16:15:43] <__joshua__> my_object.qty; // 10
[16:15:44] <duch_kazatel> kongthap you need to go read up then.
[16:15:45] <duch_kazatel> go learn.
[16:17:45] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, i better ask you this, the right path (after reading) is construct the java script object then send them via ajax without converting to json right? please guide some path so i can know what to read for
[16:18:20] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, so many confusion right now that's why need guide
[16:18:20] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:18:34] <duch_kazatel> attach your data as data attributes.
[16:21:00] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, after attatch the data attributes i should have something like this var bets = [{animal: 0, color:0, qty:10}];
[16:21:27] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:22:11] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, still wrong??? :(
[16:22:31] <duch_kazatel> kongthap you then access the data attributes in your javascript.
[16:23:24] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, hang on at the end will i need to come up with something like this $.ajax({ ?
[16:23:34] <kongthap> sorry
[16:23:42] <duch_kazatel> kongthap huh?  when did i say that?
[16:23:48] <kongthap> come up with something like this  var bets = [{animal: 0, color:0, qty:10}]; ?
[16:23:55] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:24:40] <duch_kazatel> kongthap you use .data() to access data attributes if you're using jquery.
[16:25:21] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, yes i believe i understand what you meant by accessing the .data()
[16:25:47] <lorfds> let’s say i have the following <p><span>hello</span>there</p> … how would i grab “there” with jquery?
[16:26:23] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, but after accessing the them, what kind of variable should use to keep them, because later i need to send whole pack of them to the backend php
[16:26:58] <duch_kazatel> kongthap you want to create an object and attach properties to it.  or an array.
[16:28:59] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, from my understanding i think i should have something like var bets = [{animal: 0, color:0, qty:10}]; so i can then post it using $.ajax({data: bets}); this is what i guess it is :(
[16:29:20] <duch_kazatel> kongthap no.
[16:29:39] <duch_kazatel> var bets = {animal: 0, color:0, qty:10};
[16:30:06] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, yes, i didn
[16:30:32] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, yes, i didn't tell you that it can be multiplet set of those
[16:30:55] <duch_kazatel> please go read about objects.
[16:31:01] <duch_kazatel> mdn has information about them.
[16:31:17] <kongthap> var bets = [{animal: 0, color:0, qty:10}, {animal: 1, color:0, qty:15}];
[16:31:28] <ilhami> Can I get a header title on my menu with Jquery UI?
[16:32:05] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, ok i will read this anyway without you i cannot come this far (far for me) :P
[16:51:44] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, this is my coding http://pastie.org/8990025#17 and this is result http://i.cubeupload.com/1TS9wN.png, i think it's look ok to me but i can post this array of object to php backend or not? right or wrong format ?
[17:03:19] <brain_shim> Hey there! I'm using jquery-ui and I have a mouseOut event that I want to guard against unless the events dragStart == dragStop
[17:03:50] <brain_shim> basically, I have this thing where I'm dragging a box around, but mouse out is being called a bunch and lagging the rendering
[17:04:24] <brain_shim> and I want to prevent that from happening, conditional on where or not the drag start and stop events are in sync
[17:04:43] <brain_shim> but I don't know how to check the events history, or if that's a normal thing to do or not
[17:04:49] <brain_shim> Any thought?
[17:04:51] <duch_kazatel> you can't do that.
[17:04:58] <duch_kazatel> there are events.  not "history"
[17:05:07] <duch_kazatel> can you whip up an example on jsfiddle?
[17:05:26] * jphase hands brain_shim a whisk
[17:05:38] <duch_kazatel> wooooo!
[17:05:51] <jphase> s/whisk/wisk
[17:06:11] * brain_shim stirs his plugins together with the whisk
[17:07:17] <brain_shim> More from a conceptual frame though, how can I check if drag start and stop events have the same count?
[17:07:25] <duch_kazatel> you don't.
[17:07:28] <duch_kazatel> that's a terrible idea.
[17:07:31] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[17:08:00] <brain_shim> I'm looking at http://jqueryui.com/draggable/#events and I see that it has a counter on the demo box that you can drag around for each event.
[17:08:22] <duch_kazatel> right - that's not the right way to do what you want.
[17:08:36] <brain_shim> cool cool. what's the right way?
[17:09:08] <duch_kazatel> set a bool and check it.
[17:09:14] <duch_kazatel> "isBeingDragged" or something.
[17:09:15] <brain_shim> any old markov chain can say stuffs the wrong way. enlighten me, kind sir.
[17:09:35] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:10:03] <duch_kazatel> when you start to drag something, set a var isBeingDragged = true;
[17:10:09] <duch_kazatel> then check that.
[17:10:11] <brain_shim> ahhh
[17:10:21] <duch_kazatel> without seeing an actual example, it's hard to tell wtf you're doing though.
[17:20:43] <brain_shim> okay, so drag counter comparison not quite fashionable. how can I tell if something is currently being dragged or not?
[17:20:54] <duch_kazatel> juuust explained it.
[17:20:59] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, this is my coding http://pastie.org/8990025#17 and this is result http://i.cubeupload.com/1TS9wN.png, i think it's look ok to me but is this right/wrong format for posting to php backend using $.ajax() ?
[17:21:59] <duch_kazatel> kongthap that's not going to work the way you think it will.
[17:22:05] <jphase> brain_shim: "duch_kazatel: set a bool and check it."
[17:22:07] <duch_kazatel> you're overwriting bat every time.
[17:22:15] <duch_kazatel> *bet
[17:24:16] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, i don't mean to argue but according to this http://i.cubeupload.com/1TS9wN.png, i have different value on each bet (bet is an object in array bets)
[17:25:19] <duch_kazatel> ah, you're right.  if you don't need to reference back to each bet again, that should be fine.
[17:25:35] <brain_shim> so I want to spy on the events as they happen to flip some booleans so I can monitor the state of the application?
[17:25:35] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, bets could be an object and each property should be a key for an input.
[17:25:53] <duch_kazatel> brain_shim that's one way, but again it sounds like you're doing something kind of strange.
[17:26:10] <jphase> brain_shim: there's a start and stop event on draggable, use those events to set your boolean to true or false and then you'll be able to check those booleans from other locations/events
[17:26:21] <brain_shim> I just want to prevent onMouseOut from happening if the element in question is being dragged.
[17:26:34] <duch_kazatel> brain_shim then yeah, set that pboolean.
[17:26:36] <duch_kazatel> *boolean
[17:26:38] <brain_shim> gotcha
[17:26:42] <brain_shim> thanks!
[17:26:53] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, i think i don't need to reference back, but the format is ok for posting to php backend right?
[17:27:09] <duch_kazatel> sure, as long as you can parse it.
[17:27:13] <duch_kazatel> dunno what PHP expects.
[17:27:32] <obert> nobody expects PHP!
[17:27:59] <duch_kazatel> D:
[17:28:06] <duch_kazatel> i expect to not  use it.
[17:33:57] <beachandbytes> Can anyone take a look at this
[17:33:57] <beachandbytes> http://jsfiddle.net/nW6Pm/3/
[17:34:38] <duch_kazatel> lookin'
[17:35:10] <duch_kazatel> closin'
[17:35:54] <beachandbytes> thanks
[17:36:18] <duch_kazatel> lots of CSS there.  media query problems?
[17:36:30] <duch_kazatel> maybe checking against EMs is the problem?
[17:39:49] <beachandbytes> Ya, im not sure not really familiar with media queries, this is css from zurb foundation
[17:39:53] <beachandbytes> framework
[17:41:05] <duch_kazatel> define "laggy"? because this works well-ish for me.
[17:41:18] <beachandbytes> it takes a while for the hover class to apply
[17:41:24] <duch_kazatel> not for me.
[17:41:25] <beachandbytes> if you remove the media query its pretty much instant
[17:42:01] <beachandbytes> are you on chrome?
[17:42:05] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[17:42:11] <duch_kazatel> well, i tested on chrome as well.
[17:42:22] <duch_kazatel> but that's a fuckton of things to have in there.
[17:43:03] <beachandbytes> if you put http://jsfiddle.net/nW6Pm/4/ , and http://jsfiddle.net/nW6Pm/3/
[17:43:09] <beachandbytes> side by side you can see the performance difference
[17:43:46] <duch_kazatel> not on my machine.
[17:44:04] <duch_kazatel> but i have to ask - 2000 options?
[17:44:28] <beachandbytes> ya
[17:44:35] <beachandbytes> thats fewer then I will actually have
[17:44:37] <duch_kazatel> why that many?  any way to reduce that down?
[17:44:54] <beachandbytes> Not really line of business apps
[17:45:36] <duch_kazatel> errr, can you subgroup things or anything like that?
[17:45:43] <duch_kazatel> because that's going to be slow almost no matter what.
[17:46:49] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, now i successfully post data to the php backend, everytime the data is sent, the php backend must also send something back, this can be done using one $.ajax() call ?
[17:47:07] <duch_kazatel> kongthap are you doing it with ajax all ready?
[17:48:30] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, yes
[17:48:44] <duch_kazatel> kongthap then put it in the response
[17:49:51] <beachandbytes> duch_kazatel, na each item is unique, I have a search that lets them filter the list
[17:50:00] <beachandbytes> which helps but the items still need to be there if needed
[17:50:02] <beachandbytes> for browsing
[17:50:03] <beachandbytes> http://jsfiddle.net/nW6Pm/5/
[17:50:07] <duch_kazatel> beachandbytes that's terrifying UX.
[17:50:08] <beachandbytes> highlights the performance issue more
[17:50:23] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, please step by step, when the php backend want to send something back how it refers to the response?
[17:50:31] <beachandbytes> how would you suggest displaying a list of 1000's of unique items
[17:50:32] <beachandbytes> ?
[17:50:46] <duch_kazatel> is there any logical grouping i can place them under?
[17:50:53] <duch_kazatel> pagination.
[17:50:53] <beachandbytes> they are all items
[17:52:20] <duch_kazatel> "they are all items" - sure, and a list of cities can still be logically grouped.
[17:54:00] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, on the php backend all i have to do is just "echo" the json right?
[17:54:16] <duch_kazatel> kongthap dunno - i don't do php
[17:57:08] <BillCriswell> I wish javascript has a simple @import.
[17:57:19] <duch_kazatel> WORD
[17:57:21] <duch_kazatel> like python's
[17:57:35] <BillCriswell> Does coffeescript offer that?
[17:57:57] <duch_kazatel> not that i'm aware of.  requirejs/amd however...
[17:58:56] <BillCriswell> Wonder if I should look into using that.
[17:59:21] <arschmitz> BillCriswell: duch_kazatel: there are also es6 modules coming at some point http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/08/es6-modules
[17:59:28] <duch_kazatel> oh that's right.
[17:59:29] <duch_kazatel> es6
[18:00:30] <BillCriswell> Keep seeing "es6", keep kind of ignoring it.. don't feel like I'll be able to for long.
[18:00:45] <duch_kazatel> not in browsers.
[18:01:47] <duch_kazatel> and with that, i leave.  g'night folks.
[18:03:10] <hooliogan132> http://jsfiddle.net/n25hM/33/ can any one work out why the white diamonds wont behave the same as the particle
[18:07:02] <kongthap> i have success: function(data) { console.log("OK") } in my $.(ajax) call, i can ensure that data has been posted because new data apears in the database, but why nothing is logged to the console on success ?
[18:07:29] <BillCriswell> arschmitz: As of right now I'm just concatenating, it works but keeping things in order and having to alter my gulpfile for the concatenation doesn't quite feel right.
[18:07:34] <BillCriswell> I might just be picky.
[18:09:17] <iSDP> next question, how can i execute a function when a div is visible?
[18:10:16] <BillCriswell> iSDP: if( $('div').is(':visibie') ) doSomethingNeat();
[18:11:55] <arschmitz> BillCriswell: yeah amd could be the way to go even if you dont use it in production you could use it within grunt or gulp to build your final file
[18:12:01] <iSDP> BillCriswell, thanks :)
[18:12:06] <arschmitz> this is what all the jquery projects pretty much do at this point
[18:12:20] <BillCriswell> iSDP: No problem!
[18:12:51] <iSDP> BillCriswell, and selecting on <div lge-attr="index:tab1;"> ?
[18:13:19] <arschmitz> BillCriswell: we use amd internally to manage everything then we have a grunt command which creates a build which strips all the amd wrappers and concats and minifies everything
[18:13:32] <BillCriswell> arschmitz: I was just looking at the jQuery project on github.
[18:13:46] <BillCriswell> arschmitz: Ah cool. Is that kind of what like this Browserify thing does?
[18:13:50] <arschmitz> BillCriswell: might want to look at jquery ui or mobile
[18:14:01] <iSDP> i'm working on a smart tv app =]
[18:14:02] <arschmitz> BillCriswell: just because they closer match a real life project
[18:14:13] <BillCriswell> arschmitz: I will look at that.
[18:14:38] <arschmitz> BillCriswell: its not much different buy the exports are a little different
[18:14:50] <Velveeta> for any grunt users interested, one of my coworkers recently published a grunt plugin that helps to alleviate 400+ line gruntfiles by breaking them up more modularly: https://github.com/marcusellis05/grunt-tasks
[18:15:11] <BillCriswell> arschmitz: Ok, awesome to know.
[18:15:14] <BillCriswell> Thanks for the tips.
[18:15:16] <Velveeta> now instead of one large and unwieldy file, you can have multiple large and unwieldy files
[18:15:52] <BillCriswell> iSDP: I'd do like $('div').filter(function(){ return $(this).attr('lge-attr') === 'index:tab1;'; });... but I'd definitely try to find a better way to get to that element.
[18:15:55] <iSDP> BillCriswell: if($(div [lge-attr="index:tab1;"])).is(':visible')) doFunction(); ?
[18:16:23] <BillCriswell> iSDP: That can work yeah. No space between div and [ though.
[18:16:39] <iSDP> okay =]
[18:16:49] <BillCriswell> $('div[lge-attr="index:tab1;"]').is(':visible');
[18:17:46] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Haha, just can't get comfortable with grunt really. Not sure what it is.
[18:18:19] <Velveeta> i love grunt for task automation, especially during the dev cycle, but it makes deployment a snap also :)
[18:18:25] <Velveeta> those gruntfiles can just grow to be such eyesores
[18:18:35] <arschmitz> Velveeta: we use load-grunt-tasks
[18:18:46] <arschmitz> Velveeta: which that uses internally
[18:19:40] <Velveeta> load-grunt-tasks loads your grunt dependencies based on file globs, which is slightly different than what this grunt-tasks module does, but grunt-tasks does use load-grunt-tasks internally
[18:20:09] <Velveeta> grunt-tasks lets you create 1 < 10-line gruntfile, which seeks a config file, tasks definition file, etc
[18:20:23] <Velveeta> so you can split those sections of your gruntfile out into separate file modules
[18:22:23] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: How much do your grunt files do? I must not realize how much it can actually do haha.
[18:24:24] <Velveeta> depends on the project, but my own project's gruntfile has watch tasks for js and less files that change, and recompiles the less into css, and jshint's the js files automatically, then when it comes time to deploy, it creates a build directory, concats/uglifies/minifies the js, concats the css, uses yuidocs and jade templates to autogenerate the API site documentation, creates a nuget package file for deploying to our
[18:24:24] <Velveeta> nuget server, etc
[18:24:40] <Velveeta> all with a single command
[18:24:57] <arschmitz> BillCriswell: The jQuery mobile and ui ones do a lot they can run tests build demos build css build js concat minify they contain part of our release processs
[18:25:25] <arschmitz> they build our packages for cdns and zip files
[18:25:43] <arschmitz> run jshint run jscs
[18:26:40] <BillCriswell> That's a lot more than I ever used things like this for.
[18:27:24] <Velveeta> yeah, once you get your config file whipped up and sorted out, it's pretty powerful
[18:34:13] <jphase> hmm, wish I knew a script kiddie with a botnet :\
[18:37:27] <BillCriswell> jphase: Why?
[18:38:05] <jphase> want to test my lil' 512mb vps instance to see if someone can take it down and watch logstalgic to see where I might be able to improve on caching/CDN stuffs
[18:38:15] <jphase> nothing blackhat... just preventative care :)
[18:44:46] <BillCriswell> jphase: UNderstood.
[20:56:33] <LoneStar99> hwdy folks
[20:59:33] <jphase> herro
[21:18:12] <MikeK2> Hi, I have a question. Is there any way to get (with php) these matches from this website? http://egamingbets.com/tables#starcraft When i see the sourcecode, the matches are generated by javascript and not static code
[21:41:02] <jphase> MikeK2: I'm sure there is but it's a bit of an angular.js mess in there
[22:07:31] <Hyperking> Can someone help me figure out why my owl plugin isn't working http://cyberspacecreator.com/themes/myproject/portfolio-item/project-number-one/
