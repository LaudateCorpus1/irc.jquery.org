[07:23:25] <karstenk> how can I continue to use const orders in .then()     https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/CY26OVaT4gPorNa5caQBiA  ????
[07:40:41] <pavonia> karstenk: Wat's wrong with just using orders there?
[12:25:56] <srg> Hi. I'm trying to write a snippet that highlights a <tr> background if a radio box is enabled. https://jsfiddle.net/2dgnu81k/ My issue is that it highlights ALL rows, and I also don't know how to get the <input> selector.
[12:26:02] <srg> Any tips? Thank you!
[12:39:11] <pavonia> srg: The problem is you don't check the current row ("this") for the "on" value but always the row1, so in each case you get a truthy result which highlights the current row
[12:39:40] <pavonia> If you just want to highlight row1, you don't even need a loop
[16:10:07] <on3pk> Hey.  I have an array of buttons.  Is it possible to findout which button I'm clicking when compared to $("button").get()?  I.e., what index in that array the button I clicked is?
[16:14:23] <on3pk> I found out how.  Maybe not the most efficient.  But use the event.target to compare each element in the .get() array
