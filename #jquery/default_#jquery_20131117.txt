[00:04:22] <Whiskey> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/4xb9B/8/ thats not working i don´t see why
[00:04:50] <Cork> O_o'
[00:05:14] <Cork> Whiskey: what would that change in the problem your fiddling with?
[00:05:30] <Cork> ok... what are you trying to do?
[00:06:16] <Whiskey> just make a replace function
[00:07:05] <Whiskey> insted of do " $(this).html($(this).html().replace(/( \*+|\* | \*)/gi, "<span class=\"green\">$1</span>"));" every time
[00:10:46] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/4xb9B/9/ <-- that looks more correct to me, but still not working
[00:14:27] <Whiskey> and then when you send it whit a $1 a bit unsure on that one
[00:21:01] <Whiskey> Cork?
[00:22:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> Whiskey: your msising comma
[00:23:01] <Cork> Whiskey: http://jsfiddle.net/4xb9B/10/ is prob what you are looking for
[00:23:20] <Cork> though you prob want it to loop the this variable
[00:23:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> Crok....how does $(this) target div
[00:23:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> dont understadn
[00:23:59] <Whiskey> Cork, can you set that div inside the function and just have textReplace(/(\*)/gi, "<span class=\"green\">$1</span>");?
[00:24:15] <Cork> sure
[00:24:28] <Cork> Whiskey: but then you would hardcode the selector
[00:24:42] <Cork> Rohan_Bhangui: it is a plugin for jquery
[00:24:49] <Cork> (the function is i mean)
[00:24:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhhhh
[00:25:05] <Whiskey> Cork: it will always be the same so it won´t matter :)
[00:26:09] <Cork> Whiskey: http://jsfiddle.net/4xb9B/12/
[00:26:20] <Whiskey> yeh thats nice thx
[01:48:48] <Krisostoomus> [11:45.10] <Krisostoomus> Is it possible with the http://tablesorter.com plugin for table sorting not toload the entire table at once, I have 4000 rows and I want to see the results quicker, i dont need to see all the results.
[01:51:14] <Krisostoomus> mus> Hello... I'm using www.tablesorter.com javascript table sorter plugin. Thisgets all the results to show table. But I want to see this table by pages quicker. Is it possible somehow to  see this quicker? Thanks in advance..
[02:28:27] <jop008> is there a nice alert mechanism where I can have html with an hyperlink?
[02:48:08] <voidbottle> hi guys
[02:48:55] <voidbottle> after <ul><li> list appended i can't catch click event on them. Seems jquery don't understand that they exist. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7511849
[02:50:10] <voidbottle> when i click on <span><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus-sign"></i>tester2</span> i don't get message  alert("Click on node") (28 string) coffee.js
[02:50:13] <voidbottle> why?
[02:52:43] <chao> i don't see an element with the class tree there
[02:53:03] <voidbottle> chao,  oh sorry it's a parent div element
[02:58:01] <voidbottle> chao, here is updated gist: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7511940
[02:59:16] <voidbottle> chao, it works only first time when i click on parent node. When i click on child not i can't catch click event.
[02:59:58] <chao> try e.stopPropagation
[03:00:26] <chao> e.stopPropagation(); as your first line in the click callback
[03:01:08] <voidbottle> chao same result :(
[03:02:35] <voidbottle> chao, i think problem in selectors $(".tree li.parent_li > span").on "click", (e) ->
[03:03:40] <voidbottle> probably it works only for 1 level
[03:04:08] <chao> the selector is normal css, so normal css rules apply
[03:04:24] <chao> whitespace matches any descendand, where > matches only direct child
[03:04:47] <voidbottle> chao hm then this seems to be work
[03:24:15] <eLenoAr> should be workin fine ... http://jsfiddle.net/mB6yT/
[03:30:56] <voidbottle> eLenoAr, hello! thank you for reply!
[03:31:51] <voidbottle> eLenoAr, yes, but it's don't works for me i have a same code here but... seems it's works different when we have a appended element
[03:38:12] <eLenoAr> hm .. what about event delegation like http://jsfiddle.net/mB6yT/4/
[03:40:10] <chao> this one works.
[03:40:11] <chao> http://jsfiddle.net/mB6yT/5/
[03:40:17] <chao> with stopPropagation
[03:41:11] <chao> as i said oh wait never mind
[03:41:19] <chao> i am out...
[03:51:23] <voidbottle> chao :) thank you seems i already fix stopPropaganation
[03:51:49] <voidbottle> chao but i have a same problem could you give me advice how to debug it in Javascript?
[05:27:40] <bibi346> I just saw that the hquery library could be included at the end of the page, before "</body>", I don't understand how it is possible, what does the dollar sign means to the browser when jquery isn't included already? How does it know it should ignore it for the moment and re-execute it later?
[05:42:18] <paulvd> hello, trying to get this to work but I guess I am doing something wrong there http://jsfiddle.net/5DKUp/
[05:49:21] <bibi346> The following code works : http://jsfiddle.net/ehZpY/ . However, if I declare $ at the end, it doesn't anymore, so I'm wondering how jQuery does to allow itself to be included at the end? I'm confused...
[05:53:14] <pixolin> Hi. I want to toggle display for certain <div>'s when hovering over corresponding <div>'s, but don't know what selector i should use. I have pasted a jsfiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/NjcaP/.
[05:54:37] <paulvd> pixolin: you want it to be displayed when hovered over what?
[05:54:50] <pixolin> yes, exactly
[05:55:09] <pixolin> the way I set up the fiddle upon hover all countries are displayed
[05:55:33] <monk3y> pixolin: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1041344/jquery-multiple-class-selector
[05:55:37] <pixolin> but I only want to display "France" if you hover over "Paris", "Germany" if you hover over "Berlin", etc.
[05:56:24] <monk3y> pixolin: using my link before, now you want to get the data-name from the element that fired the event, and add that in as the second class-name.
[05:56:25] <pixolin> monk3y: sorry, but I think this doesn't quite fit with what I want to achieve?
[05:56:47] <pixolin> Oh … OK. I see. and how would I do that?
[05:59:40] <monk3y> pixolin: Yeah sorry I mentioned the strategy before the link.  As for getting the data-name into the selector, I'm a bit rusty so I'm Googling slowly .. hoping someone will cut-in . . .
[06:02:26] <pixolin> actually I want something as $( 'data-name-value').hover( function() { $('.data-name-value').toggle(); }); … but for one I don't know how to select data-name-value and for the second I don't know how to use that as a variable to select the corresponding class.
[06:04:32] <monk3y> pixolin: are you generating these classes/ids/data-names dynamically (with code) or statically?
[06:04:43] <pixolin> statically
[06:05:34] <pixolin> it's basically like a menu with three items and I want to show content out of the menu corresponding to the menu item you hover
[06:06:18] <monk3y> pixolin: and you *need* all these tags as classes?  ie you've got CSS styling off these classes?  Or you're just using classes 'cause you can have multiple?
[06:07:04] <pixolin> that was just my clumsy approach so far
[06:08:33] <monk3y> No that's ok, makes sense, just checking to see whether we can do this a different way and not screw up styling.
[06:09:43] <monk3y> pixolin: 'cause the most straight-forward way of doing this would be <div id="berlin">Berlin</div>, <div id="country-of-berlin">Germany</div>.  Then your hover function, in pseudo-code, would be: take the ID of the element fired, and toggle the element with ID "country-of-" + e.ID.
[06:10:40] <monk3y> I just have my head in other things at the moment and can't see how to get to the element fired within the hover func, but then you just need to get its ID.
[06:11:19] <pixolin> sounds interesting. I need to fiddle around with it.
[06:12:02] <monk3y> It shouldn't be too hard at all, but sorry I can't just pump out the code here.  I've got a massive coffee waiting for me so I may have some magic after that.
[06:13:51] <pixolin> thank you anyway, I just try to find a way with that.
[06:16:47] <monk3y> pixolin: uh I'm a dummy.  Looking in the jQuery docs - in the hover func, the firing element is 'this'.  So to get its ID within the hover handler; cityId = $(this).attr('id').  Then the selector for the specific element to toggle will be $('country-of' + cityId).toggle()
[06:17:09] <monk3y> s/country-of/country-of-/
[06:17:19] <pixolin> oh, great, let me try that
[06:17:53] <monk3y> Once again that may be clunky/inelegant, but get it working right first, then get it working sexy.
[06:21:50] <opreaadrian> monk3y: why would you want to go through jqueryfy-ing 'this' and adding up a method call when you can literally do `this.id`
[06:22:13] <pixolin> that's what i got now: http://jsfiddle.net/NjcaP/1/
[06:22:28] <monk3y> 'cause I had absolutely no idea.  Hence; predicating someone cutting in and helping out.  Like you did.  Gracias.
[06:23:01] <pixolin> only thing that bothers me atm is I'm using ID's (which I wanted to circumvent by using data-name attribvute)
[06:23:04] <monk3y> (I hoped, but the first Google-link I found said $(this).attr.. etc, so I raised an eyebrow but went with it.
[06:23:36] <opreaadrian> pixolin: if cross-browser compat isn't your concern (i.e. you don't need to support stinky browsers), go ahead with the data-attrs
[06:24:40] <pixolin> 'k … uhm, again, I'm pretty clumps with jQuery and now tried to implement your this.id … but failed. http://jsfiddle.net/NjcaP/2/
[06:24:49] <pixolin> clumsy*
[06:25:14] <monk3y> Not $(this.id) .. just "this.id;".
[06:25:15] <opreaadrian> pixolin: because you
[06:25:40] <pixolin> 'k that looks better: http://jsfiddle.net/NjcaP/3/
[06:26:08] <opreaadrian> pixolin: sorry for the mistake, monk3y: thanks for filling in the blanks :D
[06:26:33] <pixolin> and instead of ID I could go for this.data(name=London) when I have a <div data-name="London" …>?
[06:26:52] <monk3y> Hey no mistake at all, I knew what you meant.  My coffee just kicked in.  With our powers combined - we could BE captain planet!!
[06:27:03] <pixolin> heh
[06:28:39] <monk3y> pixolin: re: data.  Yeah as opreaadrian said it's not going to be completely browser-safe, but I like your idea of using 'data' to take the dependency off IDs.
[06:28:48] <monk3y> Not sure of your syntax but follow that design.
[06:29:04] <pixolin> I fail with cityID = this.data(name); though
[06:29:31] <monk3y> Ah.  That's because it's a jQuery accessor; http://api.jquery.com/data/
[06:29:44] <monk3y> So; $(this).data('name), I believe.
[06:29:53] <monk3y> Bah.  $(this).data('name').
[06:30:10] <monk3y> Stoopid compacted laptop keyboard grumble grumble etc.
[06:30:31] <pixolin> HTMLDivElement has no method 'data'
[06:31:37] <monk3y> :/
[06:32:53] <opreaadrian> Just a second pixolin, monk3y , I'll do a 'bin' with the code
[06:32:59] <opreaadrian> And some optimizations
[06:33:05] <opreaadrian> optimisations*
[06:33:11] <pixolin> this is what I have so far: http://jsfiddle.net/NjcaP/5/
[06:37:04] <opreaadrian> http://jsbin.com/OnAQerA/7/
[06:37:07] <hfp> Hi guys! In the following: http://jsfiddle.net/EYXpj/1/, I would like to kind of flash the QR code on load to show users they can interact with it. My problem is that all 4 instructions get executed at the same time when the document is ready and they are cancelling each other out. How can I split it into two steps and delay the second step? Thanks!
[06:37:07] <opreaadrian> Try this one.
[06:38:09] <opreaadrian> Line 5 - typo :     $('#qr')fadeTo("fast", 0.5, "swing");
[06:38:13] <opreaadrian> Missing a dot.
[06:38:27] <opreaadrian> Put that one, and it flashes.
[06:38:58] <hfp> Ah, thanks! It's always the dumbest mistakes that you can't see...
[06:39:44] <opreaadrian> I know what wasting time with typos means.
[06:40:07] <opreaadrian> monk3y, pixolin , did you guys get the code or should I throw in some comments ?
[06:40:18] <pixolin> just looking at it
[06:40:47] <pixolin> quite different to what i had so I need to fidn a way through it :)
[06:40:52] <hfp> opreaadrian: As a side note, how does jQuery knows that I don't want to run everything in parallel but just the .fadeTo and .fadeIn|Out in pairs?
[06:40:57] <hfp> know*
[06:40:59] <opreaadrian> Do you need that exact structure ?
[06:42:40] <opreaadrian> hfp: jQuery doesn't know anything, it's a simple library. The JavaScript interpreter on the other hand knows that these are synchronous operations, and it executes them sequentially, one after the other, so they get evaluated in the order they appear in your code.
[06:42:57] <monk3y> opreaadrian: nice one mate.  You made it jQuery-independent, and hopefully browser-agnostic (e.target.dataset?)
[06:43:37] <pixolin> Just not noob friendly :D
[06:43:55] <pixolin> reads like Perl to me o.O
[06:44:04] <opreaadrian> it's still dependent upon jQuery because it uses jQuery's event listener functionality, but it can be taken a step further to use the standard addEventListener functionality.
[06:44:12] <opreaadrian> pixolin: I'll throw in some more comments
[06:44:33] <pixolin> why do you use mouseover and not jquery's .hover() ?
[06:44:58] * pixolin at least /tries/ to learn something …
[06:45:13] <monk3y> opreaadrian: ah sorry you do use jQuery, was just looking at the new lines.  Muh bad.
[06:45:51] <opreaadrian> pixolin:  because those will get replace at some point, and it's good for your help to specify the pure javascript Event, rather than calling a method that does this thing behind the curtains for you and add-up another function call.
[06:46:03] <monk3y> pixolin: Perl is good for you.  Puts hair on your chest*.  * and eyes.
[06:46:15] <pixolin> don't you remind me … 
[06:46:42] <opreaadrian> When you'll deal with more complex code, you'll try to cut down any extra fat that you can spot... and unnecessary function calls, are part of that category.
[06:46:59] <voidbottle> guys is there any best way to do it? $(self).append(buildchild(data)).hide().show('fast') ?
[06:47:09] <voidbottle> append + show effect
[06:47:14] <pixolin> Perl was that fascinating course I attended which never got finished and where I even couldn't follow the code I wrote in the class a day later :D
[06:47:31] <opreaadrian> voidbottle: give us some context, make us a bin or fiddle .
[06:48:17] <opreaadrian> voidbottle: I hope that self is not declared somewhere in your code like this var self = $(this);
[06:49:00] <voidbottle> opreaadrian, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7514246
[06:49:33] <pixolin> opreaadrian: could I use getElementbyClass instead?
[06:51:12] <voidbottle> opreaadrian, is it ok? i can't make jsfiddle cause i making AJAX requests to my local dev server. and i can't make this from JSFIDDLE
[06:51:57] <opreaadrian> voidbottle:  firstly       $(self).append is redundant, because you already have self as a jQuery `self = $(this).parent()` so basically your `$(self)` is `$($(self))`
[06:53:07] <opreaadrian> voidbottle: I need to rephrase that : `$(self)` is redundant because you already have `self = $(this).parent()` which returns a jQuery object, so basically when doing `$(self)` you
[06:53:09] <opreaadrian> you
[06:53:21] <opreaadrian> you're actually saying `$($(self))`
[06:54:04] <opreaadrian> voidbottle: who are you trying to hide? the parent or the content ?
[06:54:15] <opreaadrian> here :$(self).append(buildchild(data)).hide().show('fast')
[06:55:26] <opreaadrian> from what I read in the code you're hiding `$(self)` and showing it again. But maybe what you should do is `self.hide();` then `self.append(buildchild(data)).show()`
[06:56:39] <voidbottle> opreaadrian, it works now but i don't like that i need to hide appended element before show it with effect
[06:57:28] <opreaadrian> voidbottle: then just append it without hiding
[06:57:48] <opreaadrian> Or do you want to fade in only the new data that is inserted ?
[06:58:49] <voidbottle> opreaadrian, if i just append it it shows too fast. When i open existing node (loaded node) it's opens with show(fast) effect. When i load data from server and append it i also want to appended data shows with show(fast) effect
[06:59:21] <wilber> hi
[06:59:25] <voidbottle> but if i do somethis like this: $(self).append(buildchild(data)).show('fast')  show effect don't works cause append alredy show element
[06:59:37] <pixolin> opreaadrian: too bad … I got your code running, but it interferes with some other jQuery animation that seems to alter the mouseover
[07:00:18] <wilber> any body help me i am very new to jquery and this website also but any how i want to learn
[07:00:53] <opreaadrian> wilber: net.tutsplus.com / smashingmagazine.com
[07:01:16] <opreaadrian> wilber: Professional JavaScript for web developers - Nicholas C. Zakas, buy it, read it, learn JavaScript
[07:01:35] <pixolin> same for me actually …
[07:01:42] <opreaadrian> jQuery is just a mere tool, not a language or something that you need to learn . Once you know JS, you'll have jQuery or any other library under your belt.
[07:02:03] <paulvd> any idea why this isnt working http://jsfiddle.net/5DKUp/2/
[07:02:52] <wilber> tank you very much opreaadrian but working real time is better than reading the books
[07:02:54] <pixolin> wow, that's even free http://it-ebooks.info/book/483/
[07:03:01] <wilber> so i need a tutor please
[07:03:11] <pixolin> don't be lazy :P
[07:04:03] <opreaadrian> pixolin:  that's a paid book, don't "download" , pay for it! That man invested time and resources into writing a 700+ pages book
[07:04:05] <wilber> actually i am not lazy i wish to work more than 5 hour for this but spending time to read books is better to work directly and learn by experience is good

[07:05:08] <wilber> i have learn very few things in codecademy.com free online course
[07:05:38] <opreaadrian> paulvd: because you're not including the jQuery library from the left of your jsFiddle panel ...
[07:06:02] <opreaadrian> paulvd: and it's `slideToggle` not `slidetoggle`
[07:06:03] <opreaadrian> http://jsfiddle.net/5DKUp/3/
[07:07:03] <paulvd> wow ok didnt notice that, darn should have one more coffee i guess
[07:07:06] <paulvd> thanks
[07:07:34] <pixolin> opreaadrian: so … you are saying it's worth spending some 26€ for the printed version, yes? Last time I bought a book I wanted to get a better understanding of Object oriented Programming and ended with a book on Java7, which was highly recommended.
[07:08:09] <pixolin> I hate those books that suddenly start with "Cars and their acceleration" instead of saying it's "Arrays with functions"
[07:08:25] <pixolin> well, gone is he …
[07:13:13] <wilber> pixolin are you new to this site like me
[07:13:29] <hiimerik> Anyone recommend a good room for finding a JS freelancer?
[07:13:35] <wilber> i am also feel the same thing
[07:13:44] <wilber> about those book
[07:13:47] <goldstar> if I have two submit buttons for a form and I do $(form).submit, how do I find out which of the two was clicked? they both have different name and class attributes
[07:14:19] <pixolin> wilber: well, I'm always thankful for some good book recommendations
[07:14:20] <wilber> that what we want i want to work as freelancher
[07:14:30] <wilber> any team is there
[07:15:16] <wilber> pixolin dont go for books just have this site www.codecademy.com
[07:15:27] <wilber> and you could learn the basic
[07:17:32] <grafi> oO
[07:17:37] <grafi> please do read books ^^
[07:18:09] <visua> nah books are weak
[07:18:20] <visua> i encourage people to forget how to read entirely
[07:18:46] <wilber> no books is just for reference while we have to check it but real time work only you could learn
[07:19:12] <wilber> learning is different than experiencing it
[07:20:06] <wilber> is that is any freelance work to try
[07:24:04] <visua> you want to get paid to learn
[07:26:09] <wilber> is that any chatroom for hardware
[07:26:33] <cusco> yes
[07:26:46] <cusco> ##hardware iirc
[07:27:37] <wilber> thank you please give me the weblink
[07:29:32] <visua> you just use '/j ##channame"
[07:29:50] <cusco> type: /j hardware
[07:29:53] <visua> or you might be able to click the chan name depending on your client
[07:30:24] <wilber> thank you very much visua and cusco

[09:20:22] <Bauer1> guys, why cant I get a basic UI slider working here? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/mtfCE ultimately I need to set the min, max, and steps.. but as soon as I add something like min: 1, it stops rendering
[09:20:39] <Bauer1> even the slidechange event binder stops rendering the slider
[09:24:33] <Bauer1> ahh got it working now, I hate JS.. no errors or anything to focus where the problem is
[09:25:42] <Bauer1> but if I do it like this: $( "#slider" ).slider(max: 50); instead of separate setter for max, it stops working
[09:27:20] <Bauer1> never mind got that one too hehe :)
[09:32:49] <grafi> because its not at all valid js?
[09:32:50] <grafi> ^^
[09:37:04] <Bauer1> grafi: doesnt matter at all - syntax error must be indicated somewhere, like any normal IDE would for any development language.. but javascript is the exception
[09:37:11] <Bauer1> it doesnt have any good IDE
[09:37:15] <forgotmynick> what applications do you use to develop and test? do you do both at the same time?
[09:37:54] <grafi> im pretty sure the browser will show an error if you do something like that Bauer1
[09:38:29] <Bauer1> forgotmynick: I am not familiar with any good Javascript development application(s), even IDE like Eclipse leaves something to be desired in regards to JS handling
[09:39:40] <forgotmynick> do you think the learning curve is bigger for jquery than say PHP?
[09:40:13] <Bauer1> no, jquery itself is very nice, my gripe is with JS itself
[09:40:48] <Bauer1> PHP has a longer learning curve of course, but at least it gives a clear error what happend
[09:41:22] <Bauer1> relatively, its not perfect it has its own quirks, but nowhere near as bad as JS

[10:10:55] <hiimerik> shoky: I've got an ajax script thats giving me two weird erros
[10:12:08] <hiimerik> I am attempting to validate emails via http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=wbmLwbFz
[10:12:35] <hiimerik> I keep getting an error when trying to submit an email to the form I just PMd you re
[10:14:52] <shoky> hiimerik: i'm getting a cross-origin error because you're trying to access www.yourdomain.com  from yourdomain.com
[10:15:07] <hiimerik> ya, that's the other error ha
[10:15:25] <shoky> ok well, fix that one ;p
[10:15:48] <hiimerik> Should I just have all traffic to *url redirect to www.url?
[10:16:10] <hiimerik> Because I honestly have no idea how to fix that cross-origin domain issue
[10:16:59] <shoky> www.x is a different origin than x
[10:17:22] <shoky> just use "//path/to/file"
[10:17:39] <shoky> don't put the hostname in the links/form action/ajax urls
[10:18:14] <shoky> either that or just remove the www.
[10:19:21] <hiimerik> so for the form action just use "/"
[10:19:51] <shoky> that'd work, i think
[10:20:24] <hiimerik> k

[10:24:04] <shoky> hiimerik: form submits fine for me
[10:24:46] <hiimerik> shoky: Can you resubmit with your address? I believe it may be because my mail list is rejecting duplicate emails
[10:24:57] <hiimerik> shoky: thanks so much! I really appreciate this
[10:25:35] <shoky> hiimerik: yeah duplicate email is rejected

[12:15:13] <grafi> waaaaagh
[12:17:00] <kholby> I have an HTML file input tag.  When I click it, I want it to open the dialog but also stop propagation of the event.  If I do stopPropagation() and preventDefault(), both work; if I do just preventDefault(), the dialog does not open and the event still populates; however, if I do just the stopPropagation(), the dialog opens and the event still populates.  Can anyone offer any advice to stop the event while still allowing the dialog to open?
[12:17:21] <kholby> If it makes a difference, the click() event is actually being fired from another button.
[12:19:54] <grafi> why would you want to stop propagation?
[12:20:47] <kholby> Because if it bubbles up it will collapse the div containing it.
[12:21:06] <grafi> that sounds like an odd contraption
[12:21:18] <kholby> It's kind of like Twitter's timeline.
[12:21:52] <kholby> Things expand when you click them, close when you click out of them, therefore buttons inside them have to stop propagation to prevent the collapse.
[12:22:14] <grafi> ah, I see
[12:25:49] <grafi> [21:17:18] <kholby> If it makes a difference, the click() event is actually being fired from another button.
[12:25:53] <grafi> how does that look?
[12:26:43] <kholby> $("#idoftheinput").click();
[12:27:18] <grafi> but where is the button that triggers that line?
[12:28:22] <kholby> Relative to the input?  It's above it, calling a function addPhotoReply(this) when it's clicked.  The click handler is in that function.
[12:28:34] <krambiorix> hi, how can i set a datepicker on input fields that don't exist yet?
[12:28:55] <krambiorix> i try with $("input.date").datepicker() but that doesn't work on newly created input boxes
[12:29:13] <kholby> I did find out just now that if I make the input visible (it wasn't) and use the Choose File button, the propogation does stop.
[12:29:13] <grafi> so the event on the button itself is not the thing toggling your section?
[12:29:21] <grafi> hm
[12:29:56] <kholby> The weird thing is that I'm calling stopPropogation on the button as well, which was working before I added the click handler for the file.
[12:31:23] <kholby> In other words, clicking the Choose File button stops propagation, clicking the other button (with the click handler removed) stop propagation, but calling the click handler from the other button does not.
[12:31:56] <koneko> krambiorix, do you mean to add the datepicker before the element is added to DOM?
[12:32:17] <krambiorix> koneko, yes
[12:32:36] <koneko> How do you reference the element, like: var el = $("<input>", {...}); ?
[12:33:32] <koneko> If you have a variable 'el' referencing the element, I think it should work with $(el).datepicker();
[12:33:39] <krambiorix> koneko,  $("input.date").datepicker()
[12:33:58] <krambiorix> i want all inputs with class date even if not created yet, to have a datepicker
[12:33:59] <koneko> krambiorix, this would require the element to be in the DOM
[12:34:05] <koneko> Oh
[12:36:18] <koneko> Well you could use a $(document).on('click', 'input.date', function(e){}); to bind a datepicker to an input if it doesn't have one yet, but that doesn't look too good. Can't you access the part of code where the inputs are created?
[12:36:49] <krambiorix> koneko, yes i can
[12:37:12] <koneko> So why don't you add the datepicker when the element is created and stored in a variable?
[12:37:36] <pincher2012> Hi, could you explain, how handle chain of animations. I have this code http://jsfiddle.net/xRxpm/1/. When animation complete, I move mouse out of block, and then move mouse in block as fast as i can.
[12:38:13] <pincher2012> And i see that second animation interrupted and incomplete.
[12:38:45] <brian___> yo why doesnt $.unique() remove duplicate zeros?
[12:39:20] <brian___> a = [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3] $.unique(a) becomes [3, 2, 1, 0, 0]
[12:43:14] <koneko> brian___, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.unique/
[12:43:22] <koneko> "Note that this only works on arrays of DOM elements, not strings or numbers."
[12:43:36] <brian___> well poop

[12:43:40] <brian___> thanks
[12:43:44] <koneko> np
[12:48:09] <krambiorix> koneko, this doesn't seem to work : $("form.series").append(newitem);$("form.series").find(".date:visible").datepicker();
[12:48:57] <koneko> krambiorix, why not do a $(newitem).datepicker(); ?
[12:49:27] <krambiorix> koneko, newitem is a div
[12:50:37] <koneko> Does it hold the input?
[12:51:45] <koneko> krambiorix, I mean, is the input.date in the newitem div?
[13:01:18] <pincher2012> Hi, could you help me with animation?

[13:12:02] <needsomehelp> Hello, need help with a sticky toolbar. I use jQuery Waypoints. The problem is that when it gets in stuck mode (scroll down and you see), then it no longer centers,  instead it floats left. Another thing is that Im trying to make it transparent in stuck mode by giving it background-color:(160,160,160,0.3) !important;, but it seems  to ignore that. Any tips? URL: http://www.screammagazine.com/
[13:12:02] <needsomehelp> scream2014/board/index.php
[13:47:50] <krambiorix> koneko, sry a bit late but yes , the input.date is in the newitem div?
[13:49:14] <koneko> krambiorix, no problem, try doing a newitem.find("input.date").datepicker(); Then you only init the datepicker for the new item you're just adding instead of running it for all inputs there are in the form.
[15:27:12] <krambiorix> i have an input box in a dialog and on open i clone the element.... On init the dialog i already set the dataepicker listener... But i think after cloning the listener is gone... Although the input element still has class datepicker.... Anyone?
[15:29:22] <krambiorix> nevermind, solved it :D
[15:29:33] <krambiorix> i had to remove the class hasDatepicker and set datepicker() again

[15:59:51] <mrbubbles> Hey folks. I need to write a newsletter builder for ExpressionEngine. Back end stuff aside, the front-end (in the control panel) will be a drag/drop interface with the latest blog posts which can be dragged/dropped onto a page (was going to use jQuery UI) and then rearranged to form the newsletter. I was wondering whether this (i.e. the ordering of the stories and eventual email generation) would be a suitable application for Backbone.js (wanted to mak
[15:59:52] <mrbubbles> sure I am on the right track before I start going through some tutorials)
[16:10:49] <CodeCharm> is anyone here who might know something about the jQuery UI Accordion nuget package?
[16:12:13] <JBreit> I am looking to modify some jQuery behavior that is apart of this repo: https://github.com/garand/sticky/blob/master/jquery.sticky.js  I would like to make the navigation go off the screen and drop into place instead of just sticking to the top before it scrolls off.  What should I be looking up on Stackoverflow to accomplish this?
[16:13:32] <JBreit> I looked up with words as I would describe the behavior but it just come back with a bunch of other libraries and I have this already installed and working I would just like to extend it to create the behavior I would like it to have beyond its current function
[16:14:03] <JBreit> woul that be something in an offset?
[16:14:38] <mrbubbles> JBreit: easiest way is probably to stick a negative top spacing on it
[16:15:07] <mrbubbles> I believe the way that it works is that it adds a class of "sticky" to the parent object when it's actually sticky, am I correct? (use firebug or chrome inspector to check)
[16:16:07] <mrbubbles> if so, set the topspacing to minus the height of the bar... that means it won't trigger until after it goes off the top of the page. then add a custom line of css: .sticky { top:0; } (or whatever the CSS class that is added is)
[16:16:29] <mrbubbles> then just add a css transition to the top property
[16:16:35] <JBreit> when scrolled it adds right outside the bootstrap navbar
[16:16:43] <mrbubbles> to that it 'drops' into place rather than just appearing at 0
[16:17:07] <mrbubbles> do you have a url or a jsfiddle
[16:17:18] <JBreit> i can make one quick
[16:17:41] <JBreit> http://innermindco.com/test/editional/test/index.html
[16:18:17] <JBreit> $(".navbar").sticky({topSpacing:0}); is in the document at the bottom of my page
[16:18:45] <JBreit> since you were saying about topspacing if i put say -150 in there that would do it?
[16:18:59] <JBreit> or what ever the actual header is
[16:19:04] <JBreit> think its closer to 100
[16:19:16] <mrbubbles> if you use chrome you can use the object inspector to find out the height
[16:19:40] <JBreit> 100 even
[16:19:46] <JBreit> currently anyways
[16:19:57] <mrbubbles> Yep its 100
[16:19:58] <JBreit> I want to modify what it looks like when it drops
[16:20:04] <mrbubbles> stick -100 in for now
[16:20:10] <JBreit> move the logo and condense the nav
[16:20:15] <JBreit> no px just -100?
[16:21:04] <mrbubbles> err i think its -100
[16:21:08] <mrbubbles> can't remember try both :0
[16:22:13] <JBreit> that stops it from sticking on both
[16:22:15] <JBreit> weird
[16:22:24] <mrbubbles> nah its still sticking
[16:22:34] <mrbubbles> it's just that it sticks in the position where it gets to i.e. off screen
[16:22:56] <mrbubbles> next add css .is-sticky .navbar { top:0 }
[16:23:38] <mrbubbles> that means that when it becomes sticky it will put it at the top of the page rather than at the position where it stuck (it's currently sticking at -100)
[16:25:32] <mrbubbles> okay getting an error on that page now :) don't think it likes px
[16:28:25] <JBreit> and .is-sticky .navbar { top:0 } goes in the script area?
[16:29:20] <JBreit> I know i seen custom stuff that did .animate({top:'0'},"fast"}; attached to a jQuery selector on something else before
[16:29:38] <mrbubbles> no that is css
[16:29:45] <mrbubbles> so it will go in a <style> tag or in your css file
[16:31:34] <JBreit> hmm
[16:31:42] <JBreit> doesn't seem to drop
[16:32:20] <JBreit> in the console it says it is still at -100
[16:34:28] <mrbubbles> one sec ill look at your stagingsite
[16:35:36] <mrbubbles> okay if you look in the console the top:0 line is crossed out
[16:35:52] <mrbubbles> thats because jquery is dynamically setting the top value and overwriting the one you have set
[16:35:59] <mrbubbles> makeit : top:0 !important
[16:36:18] <mrbubbles> .is-sticky .navbar {
[16:36:19] <mrbubbles> top: 0 !important;
[16:36:20] <mrbubbles> }
[16:37:31] <mrbubbles> Good man.
[16:37:38] <JBreit> thanks
[16:38:18] <JBreit> evry time i tried to google how to do it it always just came back with sticky libs instead of some stackoverflow post explaining it
[16:38:46] <mrbubbles> yeh man no worries
[16:38:57] <mrbubbles> it's because the sticky ting doesn't have a callback so you have to do it a slightly different eay
[16:38:58] <mrbubbles> way
[16:39:22] <JBreit> gotcha
[16:39:33] <mrbubbles> oka
[16:39:41] <mrbubbles> now in the CSS somewhere just add this http://pastebin.com/pzEcGR0U
[16:39:50] <JBreit> that and I am guessing my searching offset probably didn't help since the thing it was topspacing
[16:40:43] <JBreit> got it
[16:41:06] <JBreit> i was just thinking of looking up the css stuff for that to adjust the speed a bit
[16:41:25] <mrbubbles> ah no, you've put it in the .issticky .navbar bit
[16:41:56] <JBreit> so it goes on the actual navbar not the issticky class
[16:41:59] <mrbubbles> basically you set the transition on the element BEFORE the state changes, otherwise it doesn't know what to do when it happens (if you catch my drift)
[16:42:22] <JBreit> ya
[16:42:23] <mrbubbles> so with a link (a href) if you set an animation on it then you set it on the A, not the a:hover
[16:42:41] <mrbubbles> you set the transition on colour on the A, and then actually change the colour on the A:hover
[16:43:56] <mrbubbles> hmm okay i can see you've moved it but its not working as planned
[16:43:58] <mrbubbles> thats annoying
[16:44:11] <mrbubbles> (if you use chrome inspector to turn off the top:0 property you can see it animates nicely)
[16:44:55] <JBreit> ya as soon as I turn it off it slides smoothly up
[16:45:52] <mrbubbles> hm I think the !important is causing an issue
[16:46:18] <mrbubbles> I think that because it is important its overriding the top:-100px so there is no actual transition taking place
[16:46:52] <JBreit> maybe I should look into the easing js lib?
[16:47:54] <mrbubbles> okay so the problem is basically that there is no callback for the jquery plugin
[16:48:09] <mrbubbles> otherwise it would be easy. you'd set the offset,as you've done, and then when it sticks just slide it into place
[16:48:34] <mrbubbles> we're trying to work around that using css3 but there are a couple of problems. it won't work well in ie, and the !important thing is buggy
[16:48:39] <mrbubbles> https://github.com/kevinthompson/jquery.sticky.js/blob/master/README.md
[16:48:50] <mrbubbles> You should take a look at that plugin. It has a callback function and seems to do the same stuff
[16:49:26] <mrbubbles> You could just set a sticky and then when it fires use jquery animation to move the element into place
[16:49:41] <mrbubbles> hey presto, works in IE AND animates nicely
[16:50:47] <JBreit> will have to read through that
[16:51:02] <JBreit> i know I was using something this morning that i fond in a fiddle
[16:51:20] <JBreit> but when I put it on my site the shit messed up big time
[16:51:34] <mrbubbles> hmmm
[16:51:40] <mrbubbles> well give it a go and I'll take a look if you like
[16:51:43] <JBreit> kind of looked like a pumpkin hitting the street and smasshing and then bounced back into a full page lol
[16:51:57] <mrbubbles> should be prettty easy to add in, just be careful it's called OFFSET now lol ;)
[16:52:05] <JBreit> without ever letting me get the scroll bar more than ann inch away
[16:52:25] <JBreit> yet when i was testing stuff in code pen it worked :/
[16:53:30] <xroot> Hi , guys , I have an ajax response with html content a button , I can display the returned html button in my page , but I need to make that button handle ajax request as well I can do that . it works only if I refersh the page
[16:53:34] <xroot> any help with that
[16:54:07] <xroot> I can't do that *
[16:54:51] <mrbubbles> sounds like you need to bind the action to the new button when it is created
[16:54:58] <mrbubbles> jsfiddle?
[16:54:59] <shoky> xroot: sounds like you want to use event delegation e.g.  $('#container').on('click', 'button.myClass', function(e) { ... })
[16:54:59] <JBreit> mrbubbles, this was my first attempt http://codepen.io/JBreit/pen/BfiIr
[16:55:20] <JBreit> when I added that to the rest of my page it was like a train wreck though :/
[16:55:45] <xroot> shoky,mrbubbles: let me check
[16:55:56] <mrbubbles> JBreit: I've seen that before with bootstrap
[16:56:06] <mrbubbles> I think it's because it messes wih the positioning
[16:57:35] <xroot> shoky: that does't work bro thanks ,
[16:57:53] <shoky> xroot: it works fine for me. make a jsfiddle
[16:57:55] <xroot> mrbubbles:how to bind the action to the new button
[16:58:08] <shoky> xroot: with event delegation you won't need to bind the new buttons
[16:58:55] <JBreit> mrbubbles, bootstrap is a damn nightmare imho
[16:58:59] <JBreit> first time ever using it
[16:59:26] <JBreit> the site i helped out on yesterday used skeleton and if i had tried that before I think I would have been better off
[17:00:07] <xroot> shoky:can you pleas eprovide more info about this, I'm newbs
[17:00:25] <shoky> `api on @ xroot
[17:00:25] <b-ot> xroot: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[17:00:30] <mrbubbles> JBreit: I've used it on my past 2 sites... I thought the same as you at first but it takes a bit of getting used ot
[17:00:35] <shoky> xroot: read that, especially the part about event delegation
[17:00:55] <xroot> shoky:send the link to that bro
[17:00:58] <mrbubbles> Firstly, your outer div should have a class of container
[17:01:10] <mrbubbles> that keeps things at the correct width
[17:02:04] <shoky> xroot: b-ot gave you the link
[17:02:18] <mrbubbles> JBreit: have a look at http://greenaircars.com/service/
[17:02:21] <xroot> shoky:thanks
[17:02:27] <mrbubbles> That uses Bootstrap and does something similar
[17:02:41] <JBreit> I was planning on learning how to do the whole sticky thing later than now but the site I am working on for someone they are all like "its gotta have this feature"
[17:03:01] <JBreit> was hoping to better my JS skills since I am a newb by learning to make my own before using it
[17:03:29] <mrbubbles> I've used it on my last few sits
[17:03:33] <JBreit> that is your site?
[17:03:36] <mrbubbles> Yep.
[17:03:37] <shoky> xroot:  example here.. http://jsfiddle.net/UmC2r/
[17:03:49] <JBreit> i like how the animation is on the nav
[17:03:52] <mrbubbles> I've used it on my last few sites, don't think its worth writing your own as there are plenty
[17:04:03] <JBreit> i need to come up with a cool fancy 1 pager
[17:04:08] <mrbubbles> Cheers. Look into Waypoints.js if you want to do something similar
[17:05:27] <mrbubbles> I'm still not happy with the homepage animation on that site. The slider is built off the bootstrap one and is a bit funky
[17:05:32] <mrbubbles> But the client has NO budget so it'll do
[17:05:46] <JBreit> I jst wanted to write one to learn with
[17:06:11] <JBreit> i wrote a custom carousel in AS3.0 in class before I finished in my Interactive Authoring course
[17:06:20] <JBreit> want to work on something like that in JS too
[17:06:36] <JBreit> would like to have my own lib to use that I know inside and out at some point
[17:06:42] <JBreit> till then I am using other stuff
[17:06:58] <JBreit> but trying to use more pure javascript so i am forced to read and learn it
[17:08:00] <mrbubbles> True. Depends on your focus. If your aim is to go into Javascript development then it's a good plan. If you're purely a web designer woking on commercial projects then plenty of sliders that can just be used and customsed
[17:09:55] <JBreit> I went to school for design but I want to do more development
[17:10:05] <JBreit> kind of made the mistake of going to an art school :/
[17:10:29] <JBreit> I did at least specialize n E-Learning
[17:10:51] <JBreit> so I would like to learn the dev side more so I can make educational apps and games at some point
[18:02:02] <Tingle> does jquery have a practicle rebind everything or something? because I have a single page app and when I reload page parts all the bindings are gone because the elements are ofc new
[18:02:41] <andrew9183> use .on to bind instead
[18:02:47] <andrew9183> for present and future elements
[18:03:50] <Tingle> .on?
[18:04:07] <Tingle> does that take care of this issue?
[18:04:35] <Tingle> sec I am using on
[18:04:40] <Tingle> .on('click',...
[18:12:00] <andrew9183> Tingle: http://jsfiddle.net/cpc9D/
[18:13:05] <Tingle> :O
[18:13:09] <Tingle> cool thanks
[18:13:13] <Tingle> thats wonderful
[18:28:09] <Tingle> andrew9183: is there maybe also a document 'on' event for when content is loaded over append()?
[18:45:31] <styraco> How do I bind an anonymous callback to promise.progress http://jsbin.com/OqicImI/1/edit?html,js,output?
[19:10:05] <jobney> http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[19:21:21] <styraco> jobney: was that for me?
[19:21:29] <jobney> yes

[21:56:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> would someone kick this person
[22:34:02] <Cache_Money> Is there an easy way to parse out the contents of a submitted form using jquery?
[22:34:25] <Cache_Money> I don't want to load a new page, I'd like to capture the data and show a new div
[22:44:36] <sacho> Cache_Money, you could use .html()
[23:00:51] <xinming> when I use delegation    $(node).on('click.a', '[class]', handler_a);     $(node).on('click.b', '.new_class', handler_b);   <--  In this case, How do we make handler_b has higher priority and when ask jquery to skip the processing of handler_a please?
[23:02:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cache_Money: if its a submitted form then i am assuming you are using php to process
[23:02:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cache_Money: you could benefit from a ajax request
[23:04:11] <Cache_Money> sacho: I tried $('#form_id:input').select();  but returned empty array.
[23:04:35] <sacho> ok
[23:05:50] <xinming> got it, stopImmediaPropagation()
[23:18:04] <jop008> I have many concole.log messages in my code can I suppress them quickly?
[23:18:19] <jop008> Can I define my own console ?
[23:19:29] <Cork> jop008: window.console = { log: function() {} };
[23:20:07] <jop008> okay handy
[23:23:53] <jop008> Can I refer to the old console.log function when I am redefining console.log?
[23:24:12] <Cork> jop008: delete window.console; should solve it
[23:24:39] <jop008> I want a verbose parameter when a message must be displayed
[23:25:02] <Cork> jop008: why not just use a different function name?
[23:25:27] <jop008> in my code I have concole.log everywhere
[23:25:42] <jop008> Must I do a change replace action?
[23:26:10] <jop008> and change console.log in another function?
[23:27:34] <Cork> yes
[23:27:49] <Cork> window.console.my_verbose_logger = function() {}
[23:31:44] <nights> hi
[23:32:20] <nights> im trying to send serialized data with the {} syntax in my ajax request
[23:32:50] <nights> data: { $('#checkout-form').serialize(), isAjaxRequest: 1 },
[23:32:56] <nights> this row isnt valid
[23:33:26] <nights> what i used before was: data: 'js:jQuery("#checkout-form").serialize()+"&isAjaxRequest=1"
[23:33:53] <koneko> nights, do you want to add the 'isAjaxRequest' param to the request?
[23:34:02] <nights> its not important,
[23:34:06] <nights> but im not sure how to combine
[23:34:21] <nights> { varlabel: var, varlabel2: var2 }
[23:34:22] <nights> with
[23:34:28] <nights> $('#checkout-form').serialize()
[23:34:36] <nights> is it possible to use both?
[23:36:32] <koneko> nights, maybe use $("#checkout-form").serializeArray() and push a {name: "isAjaxRequest", value: 1} to it
[23:36:48] <nights> nevermind
[23:36:49] <nights> ah
[23:36:52] <nights> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10398783/jquery-form-serialize-and-other-parameters
[23:36:57] <nights> its possible to add
[23:37:03] <nights> funny i was just about to test that
[23:37:09] <nights> like
[23:37:09] <nights> data: $('#checkout-form').serialize() + { isAjaxRequest: 1, submit: 1 },
[23:37:20] <Cork> no
[23:37:29] <Cork> nights: if you want to add extra data use serializeArray
[23:37:36] <Cork> serialize gives you a string
[23:37:42] <Cork> so you can't add objects to it
[23:37:55] <nights> serialize() effectively turns the form values into a valid querystring, as such you can simply append to the string:
[23:38:02] <nights> that seems accurate though
[23:38:04] <nights> its not?
[23:38:21] <koneko> You could append another string, not an object
[23:38:25] <Cork> sure, but you would have to do all the convertion your self
[23:38:37] <koneko> $("#checkout-form").serialize() + "&isAjaxRequest=1"
[23:38:41] <Cork> including the encoding
[23:38:45] <nights> yeah it doesnt seem to work
[23:38:47] <nights> just tested
[23:38:52] <Cork> it works
[23:38:58] <Cork> you just have to be careful
[23:39:03] <nights> the other two parameters were missing
[23:39:10] <koneko> but if serialize() returns an empty string I don't know if the ampersand won't mess it up
[23:39:14] <Cork> then your adding them wrongly
[23:39:35] <nights> ah sorry i did
[23:39:36] <nights> data: $('#checkout-form').serialize() + { isAjaxRequest: 1, submit: 1 },
[23:39:41] <nights> but ok
[23:39:46] <nights> ill try your approach
[23:39:49] <nights> cus i need encoding
[23:40:06] <Cork> nights: data: $.extend($('#checkout-form').serializeArray(), [{ name: 'isAjaxRequest', value: 1 }, { name: 'submit', value: 1 }])
[23:40:21] <nights> hm
[23:40:47] <nights> so its effectively combining two arrays?
[23:40:54] <Cork> yes
[23:40:59] <nights> ok let me try that
[23:41:38] <Cork> opps
[23:41:46] <Cork> nights: sorry it should be $.merge not $.extend
[23:41:50] <Cork> extend is for objects
[23:42:08] <nights> actually it worked
[23:42:13] <nights> but let me use merge then
[23:42:17] <nights> quite difficult to type all of this
[23:42:17] <Cork> ya, but it might overwrite data
[23:42:21] <nights> hm
[23:42:25] <nights> i saw the form data
[23:42:36] <nights> the non serialized parameters were put first
[23:42:39] <Tingle> im using the newest jquery version, 2.0.3 - but it still wont shut up about its deprecated functions. Anyone know how to remove the errors or why the newest version is doing that? Its been doing it since 1.10.2
[23:43:09] <Cork> Tingle: are you using jquery-migrate?
[23:43:19] <Tingle> mm no
[23:43:27] <nights> Cork: thanks vm, its fine now
[23:43:28] <Tingle> just the normal 2.0.3 from the site
[23:43:43] <Cork> what is the error/warning?
[23:43:45] <nights> very useful tip to merge arrays
[23:43:52] <Tingle> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.3.min.js
[23:43:56] <Tingle> thats what Im using
[23:44:02] <Cork> Tingle: what is the error/warning?
[23:44:04] <Tingle> or should I be using this map file?
[23:44:16] <Tingle> Use of attributes' specified attribute is deprecated. It always returns true.
[23:44:23] <Tingle> Use of getPreventDefault() is deprecated.  Use defaultPrevented instead.
[23:44:27] <Cork> ah, that
[23:44:28] <nights> Cork: fyi, using merge made the order correct again
[23:44:55] <Cork> nights: ya, extend isn't meant for merging arrays
[23:45:20] <Tingle> its a pain seeing js errors/warnings in my console all the time
[23:45:36] <Tingle> am I using the wrong version or something
[23:45:38] <Tingle> or wrongfile
[23:45:39] <Cork> Tingle: that warning will most likely exist until there is no browser on the market that needs getPreventDefault
[23:45:59] <Tingle> o
[23:46:01] <Cork> Tingle: those warnings comes from the browser, and if you just check if that function exist it will throw the warning
[23:46:03] <Tingle> so everyone has it?
[23:46:14] <Tingle> meh ok -_-
[23:46:27] <Cork> ya
[23:47:22] <d3m0n> Hey guys, can someone take a look at this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/DQzLQ/ the console out puts correctly but it's not swaping the span text.
[23:48:33] <Cork> d3m0n: i would recommend using two child elements and toggling them with css instead
[23:49:10] <Cork> d3m0n: the reason it doesn't work is cause the entity gets expanded when it is added to the dom
[23:49:30] <Cork> so &#x25be; becomes ▾
[23:49:47] <Cork> and "&#x25be;" !== "▾"
[23:49:53] <d3m0n> It seems to work without the span added though
[23:50:14] <d3m0n> http://jsfiddle.net/DQzLQ/1/
[23:53:03] <Cork> d3m0n: http://jsfiddle.net/DQzLQ/2/
[23:54:06] <Cork> d3m0n: also don't use a tags for action clicks
[23:54:10] <d3m0n> Hehe Thanks, just curious though is the reason why it wont work for span is for the entity too? I mean
[23:54:13] <Cork> d3m0n: use <button> or any normal span
[23:54:26] <d3m0n> itsitll be a link
[23:54:29] <d3m0n> it'll be*
[23:54:35] <Cork> d3m0n: the reason it doesn't work is cause the entity gets expanded like i said
[23:54:44] <Cork> it doesn't have anything to do with the span
[23:54:53] <d3m0n> Why does it work without the span
[23:56:31] <Cork> ugg
[23:56:39] <d3m0n> http://jsfiddle.net/DQzLQ/3/
[23:56:40] <Cork> d3m0n: a.data("text-swap")
[23:56:48] <Cork> the span doesn't have text-swap
[23:57:01] <Cork> though i still stand by my suggestion
[23:57:15] <d3m0n> derp
[23:57:41] <Cork> if you use the dom for what it is for it makes the code shorter and much simpler to handle
[23:58:05] <Cork> and again; please don't ever do <a href="javascript: void(0);">
[23:59:24] <d3m0n> Cork: Thanks, your solution is nice
