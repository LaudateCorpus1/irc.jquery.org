[00:10:36] <PatBateman> hi
[00:11:00] <PatBateman> how to prevent to run a jquery plugin more times when a window resize happens?
[00:11:29] <ravenzz> debounce it
[00:11:56] <ravenzz> I wrote a plugin for that
[00:11:56] <ravenzz> http://giuseppegurgone.com/jQuery-resizeEnd/
[00:12:06] <PatBateman> hm thx
[00:13:10] <PatBateman> and it prevents to run my slider plugin many times?
[00:13:59] <ravenzz> what do you mean by "run my script"?
[00:14:08] <ravenzz> bind it?
[00:14:56] <PatBateman> i have this code: http://hastebin.com/huxixanosu.js
[00:15:03] <ravenzz> I am afraid that you can't do much if you are using an existent plugin
[00:15:12] <ravenzz> mh
[00:15:23] <PatBateman> i see
[00:15:28] <ravenzz> oh so you want to run that function
[00:15:35] <ravenzz> once
[00:15:38] <PatBateman> yes
[00:15:56] <PatBateman> and prevent running 2nd time is resize happens
[00:15:58] <ravenzz> the yes you can use my plugin
[00:16:02] <ravenzz> old on
[00:16:39] <PatBateman> hm
[00:16:47] <PatBateman> sadly the plugin has no destroy method
[00:16:53] <PatBateman> imo
[00:16:56] <ravenzz> uh
[00:17:00] <ravenzz> so bad
[00:17:13] <ravenzz> use a different one
[00:17:15] <PatBateman> can I universally unbind a plugin?
[00:17:27] <ravenzz> well no
[00:17:59] <ravenzz> you should figure out what the plugin does and off all the event handlers and remove the plugin data manually
[00:18:01] <ravenzz> I guess
[00:18:17] <PatBateman> ok
[00:18:34] <ravenzz> do you use any js framework?
[00:18:56] <PatBateman> you mean angular.. ?
[00:20:32] <ravenzz> whatever
[00:20:51] <PatBateman> not yet
[00:21:17] <PatBateman> im learning it but the agency doesnt care.. just the money
[00:23:02] <ravenzz> mmh you may want to use another plugin tho
[00:23:14] <PatBateman> ye ill replace later
[00:23:20] <ravenzz> you should do it now
[00:23:25] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:23:38] <ravenzz> because this one doesn't even set data to the current element
[00:23:59] <ravenzz> so there is no way to check if it has already been binded
[00:24:13] <PatBateman> no time
[00:26:20] <ravenzz> PatBateman try this http://hastebin.com/pulaxifuwe.php
[00:26:32] <PatBateman> ok ty
[00:29:33] <ravenzz> PatBateman keep in mind that you must include the resizeEnd plugin
[00:29:54] <PatBateman> ok
[00:30:27] <ravenzz> or debounce the resize callback
[00:30:32] <ravenzz> search on google for that
[00:30:48] <PatBateman> yes paul irish has an article
[00:46:38] <PatBateman> how to reach a div that is on the same level as the clicked one ?
[00:46:42] <PatBateman> cant figure out
[00:46:56] <Cork> PatBateman: is it close to the current element?
[00:47:12] <Cork> you could do .siblings('div')
[00:47:22] <PatBateman> it finds all
[00:47:24] <Cork> or .next() or .prev() if it is right next to it
[00:47:25] <PatBateman> i need one
[00:47:31] <Cork> well
[00:47:43] <Cork> if you need a specific one you need to identify it
[00:47:44] <PatBateman> so <div><p><div>
[00:47:55] <PatBateman> ok
[00:47:58] <Cork> could you fiddle the structure?
[00:48:31] <PatBateman> http://hastebin.com/ticidanoya.xml
[00:48:45] <PatBateman> click on head, needs to reach slider-cont
[00:48:46] <Anticom> to get all he could use .parent().childs('div'), couldn't he?
[00:48:50] <Anticom> morning Cork btw
[00:48:57] <Cork> o/
[00:49:03] <Anticom> \o
[00:49:05] <Cork> PatBateman: and slider-cont is the clicked one?
[00:49:15] <PatBateman> no, the head
[00:49:33] <Cork> .next('.slider-cont') then
[00:49:45] <Cork> oh wait no
[00:49:54] <Cork> .nextAll('.slider-cont').first then
[00:50:43] <Cork> Anticom: we.. parent().children() can just be replaced with .siblings()
[00:50:50] <PatBateman> working, only nextAll i didnt try out
[00:50:52] <PatBateman> ty
[00:50:52] <Cork> *well
[00:51:03] <Cork> PatBateman: well you need to skip the p element
[00:51:10] <Cork> .next().next() would work too
[00:51:16] <PatBateman> right
[00:51:31] <Anticom> Cork be tolerant, it's still in the middle of the night :D
[00:51:38] <Cork> ^^
[00:51:49] <Cork> ya i know the feeling
[00:51:53] <Whiskey> Cork: do you got time to check it now?
[00:51:57] <Anticom> doesn't .next() accept an optional selector too? so .next('div') would be even simpler
[00:52:16] <PatBateman> Anticom, didnt work
[00:52:19] <PatBateman> tried
[00:52:21] <Anticom> hmkay
[00:52:27] <Cork> Whiskey: no, i never get an answer to what you want to achieve
[00:52:48] <Anticom> PatBateman But regarding their docs it does http://api.jquery.com/next/
[00:52:51] <Cork> Anticom: no it would mean "return the next element if it is a div
[00:52:53] <Whiskey> ooo
[00:52:56] <Whiskey> Cork 1sec
[00:52:58] <Cork> Anticom: not return the next div
[00:53:13] <Anticom> ow
[00:53:14] <Whiskey> i actully answerd that yesterday to don´t get the site to be owersized
[00:53:18] <xqo1> i want to get the entire message from this string, excluding the first 2 words. "msg baptistem this is a long irc message". i want to extract "this is a long irc message" from that string, how can i do that?
[00:53:20] <Anticom> i see
[00:53:46] <Whiskey> so if you have 1920px it can be max 1900px and if you on 1200px it can only be 1180px for an example
[00:53:48] <Anticom> xqo1 explode by [whitespace] and shift out first two elements
[00:53:55] <Anticom> than join again with [whitespace]
[00:53:58] <Anticom> then*
[00:54:03] <Anticom> gosh... can't even talk
[00:54:12] <Whiskey> Cork: the problem is that it has to be set dynamicly
[00:54:25] <Anticom> Whiskey use Angular :P
[00:54:27] <Anticom> hahaha
[00:57:00] <Whiskey> :P
[00:57:42] <Cork> Anticom: also explode is php :)
[00:58:18] <Anticom> Cork it's just a different terminology. The algorithm stays the same :P
[00:58:29] <Cork> .split() ya
[00:58:32] <Anticom> in js it's .split, isn't it?
[00:58:35] <Anticom> yea, k
[00:58:51] <Anticom> is there even .shift() on array's prototype?
[00:58:57] <Cork> sure
[00:59:05] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/b3UwB/4/ <-- Cork: first rule in CSS and click on text, it won´t oversize as you see
[00:59:18] <Anticom> fluent interfaces rock.. so it would be string.split(' ').shift().shift().join(' '), wouldn't it?
[00:59:41] <Whiskey> the text still oversize but i can fix that myself :D
[01:00:42] <Whiskey> like overflow: hidden; or whatever
[01:01:00] <Cork> js> var a = "msg baptistem this is a long irc message".split(' '); a.splice(0, 2); a
[01:01:03] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[01:01:14] <Cork> js> var a = "msg baptistem this is a long irc message".split(' '); a.splice(0, 2); print(a.join(' '))
[01:01:16] <b-ot> Cork: this is a long irc message
[01:01:19] <Cork> xqo1: ^
[01:04:06] <Whiskey> Cork? You get it right?
[01:04:16] <Cork> not interested
[01:05:23] <Whiskey> why? only what to do it is whit JS as it only can get the px
[01:16:42] <Whiskey> lol got it
[01:26:11] <fabioportieri> how is it called, a chart which have one bar on top of another?
[01:28:11] <fabioportieri> stacked bar chart i guess
[01:28:56] <Cork> fabioportieri: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/F%C3%B6rs%C3%A4ljningsstatistik_f%C3%B6r_blanddrycker.png/115px-F%C3%B6rs%C3%A4ljningsstatistik_f%C3%B6r_blanddrycker.png ?
[01:29:13] <Cork> or what do you mean by infront?
[01:29:21] <Cork> opps *on top
[01:29:21] <fabioportieri> yes, that one cork
[01:29:50] <fabioportieri> can't read the name
[01:30:03] <fabioportieri> but found it, thanks
[01:30:29] <Cork> well it isn't just bar chart
[01:30:35] <Cork> its a type of bar chart
[01:30:51] <fabioportieri> according to fusioncharts they called it stacked bar chart
[01:31:04] <Cork> ya
[01:31:29] <fabioportieri> i want to make a custom plugin for that, but boss says we should make the client buy fusioncharts
[01:31:31] <Cork> don't think i've heard any other name for it
[01:31:52] <fabioportieri> for a 3d version of it
[01:33:05] <Cork> fabioportieri: http://www.2general.com/blog/2012/05/30/flot_stacked_bar_chart/stack.html
[01:33:12] <Cork> ah 3d
[01:33:37] <fabioportieri> fusioncharts has cool stuff
[01:33:51] <Cork> ya, over priced though
[01:34:42] <IamTrying> _________________________ iframe parent has iframe child with: <div id=makemeFullScreen>  , when i do : makemeFullScreen.webkitRequestFullScreen();  it does not do anything at all? is it normal?
[01:35:47] <Cork> IamTrying: any js errors?
[01:36:05] <Cork> (man i hate that id's becomes variables, it's so messed up...)
[01:36:29] <IamTrying> Cork, Not at all (no errors)
[01:36:51] <Cork> fabioportieri: http://www.amcharts.com/javascript-charts/3d-stacked-column/
[01:37:10] <IamTrying> Cork, but when i do document.getElementsByTagName('video')[1].webkitEnterFullscreen();  it works from that same child iframe
[01:37:31] <fabioportieri> yea we already using amcharts for a 3d pie.. too bad the stacked doesn't suit our needs
[01:37:50] <Cork> and document.getElementById('makemeFullScreen').webkitEnterFullscreen(); ?
[01:38:04] <IamTrying> Cork, Does not ( when its a div )
[01:38:25] <IamTrying> Cork, Google Chrome 32 (stable)
[01:38:26] <Cork> IamTrying: you have a link?
[01:38:38] <Cork> IamTrying: btw i hope you support the other prefixes too
[01:40:37] <IamTrying> Cork, Thank you, i will need to prepare a customized link its messy and large
[01:41:07] <Cork> IamTrying: it might depends on from what document you do the call
[01:41:20] <Cork> but the browser should warn you if it is blocking you
[01:41:28] <Cork> so not fully sure what happens
[01:42:08] <IamTrying> Cork, that is weired which is not happening. Google Chrome > Iframe parent 1 > iframe parent 1 open iframe child 1 > the button is clicked from iframe child 1
[01:42:53] <Cork> IamTrying: and the div is in child 1?
[01:43:32] <IamTrying> Cork, YES -  <div id=iframe_child1 >  < video ... > </div>
[01:43:49] <IamTrying> Same button works for that video but not for the <div
[01:44:19] <Cork> i have a vague memory about fullscreen sometimes being limited in iframes
[01:44:25] <Cork> but i don't remember it clearly
[01:44:40] <IamTrying> YES - Cork , basically allowfullscreen= true
[01:44:48] <IamTrying> i did that too but no result
[01:44:53] <Cork> well i mean beside that
[01:45:43] <IamTrying> Cork, something like this is inside the iframe child 1 > http://jsfiddle.net/2m8ay/
[01:46:15] <Cork> ugg
[01:46:24] <Cork> IamTrying: side note, you should separate html from js
[01:47:53] <IamTrying> OK
[01:54:43] <Cork> IamTrying: http://fiddle.jshell.net/XaGLZ/show/
[01:54:56] <Cork> i hope that is somewhat what your tying to do
[01:57:03] <Cork> IamTrying: also <video> isn't a self closing element
[01:57:15] <Cork> so you need <video></video>
[02:03:59] <IamTrying> Cork, /> is used
[02:14:24] <Cork> IamTrying: that isn't valid html
[02:14:38] <Cork> <video /> is just taken as <video> and that isn't valid
[02:15:01] <Cork> IamTrying: /> is only allowed for self closed elements in html
[02:15:07] <Cork> and then the / is just ignored
[02:15:22] <Cork> so <br /> is allowed but parsed as <br>
[02:16:01] <obert> infact / is just useless
[02:17:09] <Cork> ya
[02:17:27] <Cork> if you look at how the browser looks at it it is
[02:17:37] <Cork> <video /> => error parsing loop
[02:18:02] <Cork> error parsing loops recognizes <video and strips the / at the end
[02:18:09] <Cork> parsing handles the <video> tag
[02:18:16] <Cork> and in this case
[02:18:47] <Cork> error parser sees that <video> isn't closed and tries to figure out where to close the element
[02:18:55] <IamTrying> OK - Cork thank you. But i just applied </video> still same
[02:19:07] <Cork> IamTrying: doesn't my example work for you?
[02:19:15] <Cork> IamTrying: http://fiddle.jshell.net/XaGLZ/show/ <--
[02:19:20] <Cork> this works just fine here
[02:20:42] <alicefreak> hi, After rendering the ajax response in template, I am showing user's this content (<a id="login_to_apply_coupon" >Click here to login</a>). When some click on this then colobox will appear. and It works.
[02:20:42] <alicefreak> Now I want to open colorbox automatically without any click. I also tried trigger event. but it does not work. can you please help? here is my code https://dpaste.de/pVp4. thanks
[02:21:58] <IamTrying> Cork, 1) Your solution i placed in my child iframe and double clicked on it but it never goes to full screen.  2) when i open your solution in Google Chrome simply with url then it works http://fiddle.jshell.net/XaGLZ/show/
[02:22:02] <IamTrying> Cork, please advise.
[02:22:45] <Cork> IamTrying: so what differs from your parent page setup to the XaGLZ/show one?
[02:24:49] <IamTrying> Cork, This is the parent and child > http://jsfiddle.net/2m8ay/3/
[02:27:18] <Cork> IamTrying: http://fiddle.jshell.net/2m8ay/4/show/
[02:27:47] <IamTrying> Excellent this works Cork , Thank you
[02:28:08] <Cork> IamTrying: allowfullscreen="true" was all i added
[02:28:58] <IamTrying> Cork, Must be my other code causing it. I also had allowfullscreen = "true"
[02:29:04] <IamTrying> thank you Cork i will sort it out now.
[02:41:39] <lonesoldier728> hey does anyone know what issue is here using this http://pastebin.com/5rH76wg8 with this lib http://fgnass.github.io/spin.js/
[02:42:15] <xqo1> hi
[02:43:11] <xqo1> how do you slice an array, and include the last element of the list? (im looking for the javascript equivalent of python: myList[2:])
[02:43:17] <Cork> lonesoldier728: little side note, replace this.$el.append('<div id="loading"></div>'); with var target = $('<div id="loading"></div>')
[02:43:18] <xqo1> http://jsfiddle.net/9NsJ4/
[02:43:27] <Cork> lonesoldier728: then you don't have to do the dom loopup to find it again
[02:43:34] <Cork> lonesoldier728: as that might be your problem now
[02:43:52] <Cork> lonesoldier728: and var spins = new Spinner().spin(target[0]);
[02:44:22] <Cork> xqo1: i answered this a while back
[02:44:37] <Cork> js> var a = "msg baptistem this is a long irc message".split(' '); a.splice(0, 2); print(a.join(' '))
[02:44:40] <b-ot> Cork: this is a long irc message
[02:45:38] <Cork> xqo1: js doesn't have a syntax for what your looking for
[02:45:51] <Cork> so you need to create the array you want before you join it
[02:46:40] <xqo1> Cork oh, thank you
[02:47:00] <lonesoldier728> cork when i do this line
[02:47:13] <lonesoldier728> var target = $('<div id="loading"></div>');
[02:47:23] <lonesoldier728> gives me error for $
[02:47:29] <lonesoldier728> i have to put this.$
[02:47:38] <Cork> uh
[02:47:44] <lonesoldier728> but after i put that this.$ it says unrecognized expression?
[02:47:45] <Cork> ok...
[02:47:51] <lonesoldier728> <div...
[02:47:56] <Cork> then $ isn't jquery
[02:48:27] <lonesoldier728> this.$('.col-md-9').append('<div id="loading"></div>');
[02:48:38] <lonesoldier728> i use this line initially to create the div
[02:48:41] <lonesoldier728> and that works
[02:48:43] <Cork> is some other lib providing .append
[02:48:57] <Cork> lonesoldier728: you need to identify what this.$ is
[02:49:02] <Cork> as it isn't jquery
[02:49:12] <lonesoldier728> ok
[02:49:22] <lonesoldier728> but when i even try document.getElementById()
[02:49:25] <lonesoldier728> im having issues
[02:50:02] <Cork> lonesoldier728: might be cause the id exist multiple times in the page (invalid)
[02:51:33] <lonesoldier728> well i changed it to loadingss just to see
[02:51:41] <lonesoldier728> and it is the only element on the page
[02:55:33] <lonesoldier728> I am not getting any errors or anything here is the updated code now
[02:55:50] <lonesoldier728> http://pastebin.com/vVxhwZrr
[02:57:01] <Cork> lonesoldier728: document.getElementById doesn'
[02:57:06] <lonesoldier728> ah ok itworks now
[02:57:07] <Cork> *'t return an array
[02:57:13] <lonesoldier728> i had to take the array position offi t
[02:57:16] <Sal> when i click on the <li> (with this on the left), how can i remove active classes on the other <li> in difefrent lists?
[02:57:17] <Sal> http://pastebin.com/KpnzBYTG
[02:57:55] <lonesoldier728> ok so that was the issue, i was just calling stop too soon
[02:58:04] <Cork> Sal: you have to either identify that list or you can remove all li.active
[02:58:46] <Sal> Cork: can you show me how? i have no idea
[02:59:21] <Cork> Sal: btw do you really need the extra <div>'s in there?
[02:59:28] <Sal> is there a way to remove all li.active that are in the first containig div?
[02:59:53] <Sal> Cork, i'm using it for padding, margins and borders
[02:59:58] <Cork> $(this).closest('div').parent().find('li.active').removeClass('active')
[03:00:07] <Cork> Sal: and you can't set that on ul?
[03:00:26] <Cork> Sal: if you had a class on that outer most div it would be cleaner
[03:00:27] <Sal> Cork, now that you're letting think on it, its true
[03:00:28] <Sal> :)
[03:00:53] <Cork> $(this).closest('div').find('li.active').removeClass('active') <-- if you don't have the extra divs
[03:00:59] <Sal> yes, i can put a class or an id on it
[03:01:01] <Sal> no problem
[03:01:13] <Cork> $(this).closest('.parent-div-class').find('li.active').removeClass('active') <-- if you set a class to identify the parent div
[03:01:21] <Cork> i would recommend doing that
[03:01:37] <Sal> great!, thanks
[03:03:57] <Sal> Cork, its working great! thanks
[03:04:02] <Cork> yw
[03:10:33] <morfin> hmm
[03:11:01] <morfin> i am not sure how to handle click to every element
[03:11:36] <morfin> was using that: $(document).on("click.myplugin","*",function(event){...})
[03:12:24] <morfin> did that really bind shitloads of event handlers?
[03:12:50] <morfin> or it just uses event bubbling and there is only one real handler as i expect(document.click)
[03:16:46] <Cork> morfin: just bind a click on document
[03:17:30] <Cork> morfin: and no as you use delegate the middle one and the last talk would be basically the same
[03:17:53] <Cork> except the middle one checks if the element matches '*' and uses event.target as this
[03:27:14] <lonesoldier728> i know im possibly doing this wrong, trying to call a success function after a fetch, anyone have any ideas
[03:27:15] <lonesoldier728> $this.results.fetch({params:$this.params}, {success: function() {spins.stop(); }});
[03:27:20] <morfin> hmm
[03:27:36] <morfin> wait but how will i know on which element was click started
[03:40:43] <Cork> lonesoldier728: what's a fetch?
[03:40:53] <Cork> lonesoldier728: sounds like you are asking this in the wrong channel
[03:41:01] <lonesoldier728> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18263344/backbone-js-model-fetch-parameters-cause-success-error-completed-callbacks-not
[03:41:07] <lonesoldier728> ya i figured it is a standard callback
[03:41:15] <Cork> its not
[03:41:22] <lonesoldier728> k
[03:42:03] <Cork> lonesoldier728: if it is the normal callback from the xhr ya, what you have would work
[03:49:26] <kpl> In http://jsfiddle.net/9K7ne/1/ I have included js and css for http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox. Note that the select in the Result pane is a standard select followed by "c1". Now, if you at the bottom of the in the Javascript pane remove the comment for $(".ae-selectfield>select").combobox(); and rerun, you will activate the custom-combobox from jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox. Note
[03:49:27] <kpl>  that the custom-combox is so large that it hides the "c1". So, my question is: How to make the custom-combobox get the same size as the original select so it does not hide "c1"?
[03:51:21] <kpl> There is a lot of css there for custom checkboxes. The css for custom-combo is at the end of the css panel.
[03:52:32] <kpl> The combo js and css in the fiddle is currently identical to the code on the http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox.
[04:00:17] <kpl> Please don't get distracted by the checkbox stuff. Focus on the custom-combo code, which basically is pasted in below the "combo" comments in the css and javascript panes.
[04:06:24] <kpl> A starting question may be: Where does the custom-combobox get its size info from?
[04:07:14] <kpl> From some jquery-ui standard settings?
[04:07:36] <Cork> kpl: haven't loaded the page, but check the ui's css
[04:08:05] <Cork> jquery-ui normally keeps its style rules in the css
[04:08:37] <kpl> I can only see position and margin stuff in the custom-combobox css
[04:08:52] <Whiskey> if (id==".Info" && typeof infoViewWidth === "undefined") {console.log("I was here"); window.infoViewWidth = $(".infoViewBox").prop("offsetWidth")} whats wrong there, it does the putlog twice whit menas the if question is wrong
[04:09:15] <kpl> But there is padding: 0.3em
[04:10:11] <kpl> and reducing that to 0.1em makes the custom-combobox smaller. However, still so wide that it hides neighbouring elements.
[04:11:58] <Whiskey> maybe works strange
[04:12:22] <Cork> kpl: .custom-combobox { margin-right: 2.2em; }
[04:12:46] <Cork> kpl: the dropdown arrow is position absolute so it overflows the custom-combobox element
[04:13:15] <Cork> adding the same amount of margin on the right should give the content space enough to not be covered
[04:14:16] <kpl> Thanks, .custom-combobox { margin-right: 2.2em; } makes "c1" visible by pushing it to the right.
[04:14:43] <Cork> 2.2em is the width of the arrow button btw
[04:15:25] <micalexander> ryanneufeld: you still up
[04:16:48] <kpl> Do you know what controls the width of the input part of the combobox?
[04:17:24] <Cork> kpl: just inspect the element, it's all right there :)
[04:18:15] <morfin> hmm
[04:19:17] <Cork> kpl: from the looks of it, it's the default size of <input>
[04:19:51] <kpl> Yes, in firebug I cannot see any width of the input
[04:19:53] <micalexander> Is there a way to find() an element OR another element using find()
[04:19:55] <Cork> kpl: setting a width on custom-combobox-input should work if you want
[04:20:07] <Cork> kpl: sure it can
[04:20:14] <Cork> it's just not hardcoded in css
[04:22:36] <kpl> Cork: Of course you're right again, I can do, e.g. .custom-combobox-input { width: 50px }
[04:24:12] <fabioportieri> wordpress sliders sure are fancy
[04:24:55] <Cork> fabioportieri: comma
[04:25:03] <alistair> hi
[04:25:19] <fabioportieri> comma?
[04:25:19] <Cork> fabioportieri: in the string, not separate strings
[04:25:25] <maxvi> hi everyone! I have an error in my script.  I want to use prettyPhoto but this make an error in console on this page http://www.unclesfishmarket.bumpnetworks.com/reviews/
[04:25:26] <Cork> 'selector1, selector2'
[04:25:40] <fabioportieri> Cork: you mistaken the nick eheh
[04:25:45] <Cork> ioos
[04:25:47] <Cork> :x
[04:25:49] <Cork> ya i did
[04:25:52] <Cork> micalexander: ^
[04:25:54] <maxvi> the order of script is right. I think so.
[04:26:02] <Cork> fabioportieri: thought the question was a bit strange comming from you :D
[04:26:36] <fabioportieri> Cork: i was having a look at wordpress sliders.. good looking stuff :)
[04:26:51] <Cork> fabioportieri: sliders or slideshows?
[04:26:52] <fabioportieri> http://kreaturamedia.com/layerslider-responsive-wordpress-slider-plugin/
[04:27:07] <fabioportieri> and the 3d version
[04:27:19] <Cork> slide shows
[04:27:23] <fabioportieri> slideshows i guess, but they call them sliders
[04:27:39] <fabioportieri> ah, layerslider
[04:27:42] <Cork> why can't grasp that slider and slideshow isn't the same thing -_-'
[04:27:56] <fabioportieri> ye i always confuse both
[04:28:00] <Cork> (was aimed at wp)
[04:28:10] <fabioportieri> it happens!
[04:28:24] <Cork> well it isn't strange as many site frameworks wrongly call slideshows for slider or sliders cause it is shorter
[04:28:34] <Cork> and ignores that slider is something completely different...
[04:28:50] <fabioportieri> yea indeed wp is not the only one
[04:28:51] <micalexander> Cork: like $(this).find('a.video','a.audio' ).trigger('click');
[04:29:02] <Cork> fabioportieri: but ya about the look,ya it's nice
[04:29:19] <Cork> micalexander: you just did exactly what i said you shouldn't do <_<'
[04:29:32] <Cork> "not separate strings" <--
[04:32:11] <micalexander> k I didnt see that you were pointing something above... gotcha
[04:37:02] <morfin> strange
[04:38:37] <xqo>  how do you do this correctly? var x = 1>2 ? "fals" : 2>1 ? "tru"
[04:38:52] <morfin> if i $(document).on("click.filterselect",function(){...});
[04:38:59] <morfin> it does not work
[04:39:21] <Cork> xqo: uh 1>2 2>1 ?!? what are you trying to do?
[04:39:37] <xqo> Cork im trying to understand the syntax of this, idk what its called
[04:39:48] <xqo> this works var x = 1>2 ? "fals" : 2>1 ? "tru" : "none"
[04:40:01] <Cork> well 1 won't ever be bigger then 2
[04:40:13] <Cork> and 2 is always bigger then 1 so i don't see the point in the line
[04:40:21] <xqo> i know that... its just example code
[04:40:47] <Cork> so your looking for something like var x = y>2 ? "fals" : y>1 ? "tru" : "none"; ?
[04:41:08] <Cork> then the syntax is valid
[04:41:26] <xqo> im trying to learn how to use that kind of shorthand, with the ?s
[04:42:01] <Cork> check statement ? true : false
[04:42:14] <Cork> ?mdn conditional
[04:42:15] <b-ot> Cork: Conditional Operator - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator
[04:42:19] <morfin> oh i forgot that other modules was preventing bubbling
[04:42:39] <Cork> and do write var x = y>2 ? "fals" : y>1 ? "tru" : "none"; more readable
[04:42:51] <Cork> and do write var x = y>2 ? "fals" : (y>1 ? "tru" : "none");
[04:42:52] <morfin> but anyway how should i know which element was clicked when i bind event handler to document?
[04:43:06] <Cork> morfin: event.target
[04:44:08] <morfin> oh i forgot )
[04:44:19] <morfin> because event can bubble many times
[04:45:17] <Cork> morfin: well they normally do even
[04:45:19] <morfin> but if i have some element which have handler i think i should preventPropagation to avoid closing that dialog(by document.click event)
[04:45:43] <Cork> morfin: that or check for the element in the main event handler
[04:46:01] <Cork> morfin: there is problems with using stopPropagation, in that if something else needs the event it will break
[04:46:02] <morfin> last is ugly because i use plugins )
[04:46:42] <morfin> and they are doing all stuff i need inside
[04:46:53] <Cork> you need sure
[04:47:09] <Cork> my point is that if something outside the plugin needs to handle an element
[04:47:18] <Cork> the code can't use propagation cause you stop it
[04:47:26] <Cork> and that is kinda bad for propagated code
[04:47:33] <morfin> hmm
[04:47:51] <Cork> plugins should only affect things they them self added
[04:48:01] <morfin> that dialog is what they add
[04:48:03] <Cork> and leave the rest as close to default as possible
[04:48:20] <Whiskey> Cork ready for next question :D
[04:48:29] <morfin> and it should be closed when i click anywhere but inside of that dialog
[04:48:49] <morfin> so i prevent default only for dialog not for anything else
[04:49:19] <Whiskey> <- Run on tomany probloems
[04:49:23] <Whiskey> "problems"
[04:49:25] <Cork> you mean stopPropagation
[04:49:25] <morfin> like?
[04:49:31] <morfin> ops
[04:49:34] <morfin> stopPropagation
[04:49:44] <sluggr> hi, i'm having a issue where i use .append() to get a js and a css file, and then (document).ready(). It appears these resources may still be downloading when (document).ready() fires. What's the preferred way to run my code after these files are loaded?
[04:49:53] <Cork> morfin: well ya, i've had a project where i did something similarly
[04:50:04] <morfin> for js i used $.getScript
[04:50:05] <Cork> morfin: and then i needed to added an auto timeout js script to the page
[04:50:17] <Cork> that if the user didn't do anything in the page logged them out from the server
[04:50:26] <morfin> hmm
[04:50:28] <Cork> well... lets say stopPropagation broke that quite badly
[04:50:40] <Cork> and was a big pain to sort out
[04:50:51] <morfin> as i said i am only stopping it for dialog i've created
[04:51:02] <Cork> morfin: well no
[04:51:04] <morfin> so i think everything should be fine
[04:51:11] <Cork> it stops it for everything inside the dialog you created
[04:51:21] <Cork> no matter if anyone else is interested or not
[04:51:25] <Cork> that was my point
[04:51:34] <morfin> it should not go outside of my plugin
[04:51:46] <alistair> Hey, can you help me refactor some jquery?
[04:51:57] <Cork> so if the user edits something in the dialog only you can know about it
[04:51:59] <Cork> ya
[04:52:05] <Cork> that is exactly the point i talked about
[04:52:16] <morfin> i use handlers for that
[04:52:22] <Cork> there might be other use cases you don't provide and that this code might break
[04:52:28] <Cork> morfin: for your code yes
[04:52:34] <alistair> here's where I am... http://jsfiddle.net/achisholm/Et34Q/
[04:52:38] <morfin> which being passed to plugin from outer code
[04:52:41] <Cork> you constantly forget that there might be other codes beside yours
[04:53:00] <Cork> plugins should not break code it doesn't know about
[04:53:05] <alistair> a resposive slider. It works but I want to make it better and cleaner
[04:53:20] <morfin> but how it would break
[04:53:27] <Whiskey> Im not sure if this a JS or CSS problem, http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/dP847/3/ but the row the timer go on change time when it comes down to 0 and go up again whit seconds
[04:53:55] <Cork> morfin: ex. $(document).on('change, click, keyup' resetLogoutTimer); <-- your code would break this
[04:54:15] <alistair> how can I remove repitition?
[04:54:18] <Cork> cause the event wouldn't fire if it happened inside your dialog
[04:54:41] <morfin> hm
[04:55:10] <morfin> but i do not need to close dialog if something happened in all situations
[04:55:31] <Cork> well sure
[04:55:36] <Cork> but you don't just prevent that
[04:55:43] <morfin> but how will i do that
[04:55:45] <Cork> you prevent click events from getting outside your dialog
[04:56:19] <Cork> in the click handler check if $(event.target).closest('#your-dialog').length > 0
[04:56:40] <Cork> if it is, not run the close code
[04:57:07] <Cork> morfin: i'm not saying you must do it this way, just think of the consequences
[04:57:19] <Cork> and choose your options from that
[04:58:36] <Cork> alistair: you replace the ids with a class, move the number for bg- into an data-btn="<number>"
[04:58:56] <Cork> alistair: and remove all bg- classes on each click and just adding the class for the button you clicked
[04:59:03] <Cork> that should remove all duplicated code
[04:59:24] <alistair> cool cork i'll try that
[04:59:28] <morfin> so i am not sure how to handle all that
[04:59:43] <morfin> just check e.target
[05:00:14] <morfin> but that's not good because i'll need to check for all elements inside of my dialog
[05:00:22] <Whiskey> No one has any clue why this happens and how to avoid it :(
[05:00:50] <Cork> morfin: $(event.target).closest('selector') will check if the target or any of it's parent matches the selector
[05:00:57] <Cork> so just check if any of those is the dialog
[05:01:26] <Cork> morfin: if($(event.target).closest('#my-plugin-dialog').length < 1) { /* close dialog */ }
[05:03:21] <Cork> morfin: if you prefer you can give an element to the closest() instead
[05:03:25] <Cork> that works too
[05:04:24] <morfin> hmmm
[05:04:36] <morfin> maybe
[05:05:25] <alistair> @cork, hey, so my html now has data-btn *4 added, how can I use it the jquery for example data-btn of 1 to jump to pos1 ...$(".title-slider").animate({left: pos1}, mySpeed, 'swing');
[05:05:45] <Cork> alistair: use an array
[05:05:54] <Cork> var pos = [1,2,3,4,5]
[05:06:08] <Cork> and then you do pos[$(this).data('btn')]
[05:19:49] <alistair> @cork, cheers, got it to work
[05:20:07] <Cork> alistair: another thing
[05:20:17] <Cork> $('selector').click binds one event listener to each element
[05:20:30] <Cork> for 4 elements it doesn't really matter much
[05:20:40] <Cork> but you might want to read up on event delegation
[05:21:06] <Cork> $(parent).on('click', 'target selector related to parent', func)
[05:21:11] <Cork> ?on
[05:21:24] <Cork> ?api on

[05:23:39] <alistair> I'll read up, thank you
[05:24:42] <Guest99210> what does draw.io uses for drawing UML.  svg or canvas?
[05:25:30] <Cork> uses what for?
[05:25:41] <Cork> ah
[05:25:45] <Cork> sorry read wrong
[05:25:52] <Cork> most likely canvas
[05:26:55] <Cork> should be easy enough to tell if you find a demo
[05:27:55] <Cork> Guest99210: hmm actually on inspecting the page, they use svg
[05:28:14] <Cork> so if they support old ie they user svg + vml
[05:30:39] <marcules> Hi :)
[05:31:32] <Guest99210> Cork,  ok
[05:33:02] <alistair> I just noticed my bg classes are not being removed. Took away the removeClass attribute so it's currently (".slider").addClass("bg-" + $(this).data('btn') );
[05:33:38] <alistair> if i flick through them they are all added
[05:34:09] <Cork> $('slider').removeClass('bg-1 bg-2 bg-3 bg-4')
[05:34:17] <Cork> just always remove all of them
[05:34:21] <Cork> and then add the new one
[05:34:52] <alistair> would that all go on on line like $('slider').removeClass('bg-1 bg-2 bg-3 bg-4').addClass("bg-" + $(this).data('btn') );?
[05:35:15] <Cork> it could sure
[05:35:27] <Cork> (don't miss the dot i missed though)
[05:35:35] <alistair> got it :)

[05:42:08] <daslicht> anyone knows a slideshow which can load additional images after the initial loaded has been shown ? eg open page 5 images are loaded, after the 4th call server via ajax to add more
[05:42:23] <daslicht> I havent fond any yet which can do this out of teh box
[05:42:34] <daslicht> without reinitializing the whole slideshow
[05:43:03] <sluggr> alicefreak: are you familiar with the "open" setting? try setting this to true
[05:43:47] <daslicht> this , atlest has some onBefore event handler: http://responsiveslides.com/
[05:44:00] <daslicht> but when you add new immages they are not shown
[05:44:10] <daslicht> unless you reinitialize the whole thing
[05:46:13] <alicefreak> sluggr: ok I added open:true. Colorbox loading appear for a second. then hide automatically.
[05:46:31] <decx> daslicht flexslider has an end function that fires when you reach the last slide and an .addSlide that you can use in there
[05:46:49] <daslicht> oh ! thats great , tahnk you
[05:46:52] <alicefreak> sluggr: I want to initialise colorbox when ajax content is loaded.
[05:46:55] <daslicht> that saves me time
[05:47:09] <daslicht> decx: Thank you very much !
[05:47:15] <decx> i used it to get new slides with ajax before it works well
[05:47:59] <daslicht> ?
[05:48:01] <daslicht> I try it
[05:48:20] <sluggr> alicefreak: did it show your content before disappearing?
[05:48:44] <alicefreak> sluggr: no. only icon
[05:49:15] <sluggr> alicefreak: you may have some invalid references or other error then.. any information in your console?
[05:49:53] <alicefreak> sluggr: no error message in console.
[05:51:15] <alicefreak> sluggr: It works very well when I click. But I dot want to click. I want to initialize the popup without any click.
[05:51:48] <sluggr> alicefreak: ok, i'm out of ideas
[05:52:07] <alicefreak> sluggr: no problem. thanks
[06:13:27] <somesomething> howdy. I am having trouble waiting for a nested iframe to load. I tried it with .load and .ready, both at the same time and per frame nested in functions
[06:13:32] <somesomething> but I can't figure it out :(
[06:13:54] <Cork> somesomething: you need to listen for the .load event from the iframe
[06:14:06] <morfin> anybody know how do i detect element which i clicked when i use ui contextmenu?
[06:14:09] <Cork> and you should attache it to the element before you append it to the dom
[06:17:25] <somesomething> Cork: I have tried that
[06:17:41] <Cork> somesomething: that should work
[06:17:46] <Cork> .read won't though
[06:17:46] <b-ot> Cork: No unread messages.
[06:17:52] <Cork> b-ot: hush
[06:18:10] <Cork> *.ready
[06:18:56] <somesomething> I have a command which can successfully extract the information I want from the nested iframes, yet because of a timing issue it errors now
[06:19:11] <somesomething> So I need to wait till the frames are loaded before I can access it
[06:19:40] <Cork> that is the load event
[06:19:56] <Cork> asking over and over won't change the events name :)
[06:20:37] <somesomething> Then I'm afraid I don't understand you
[06:35:38] <somesomething> Okay, let me try one more time. My thing to grab the needed text is: document.getElementById("firstiframe").contentWindow.document.getElementById("secondiframe").contentWindow.document.getElementById("finallytheelement").innerText . $( '#firstiframe' ).load seems to work. If I do the same within the function following, it fails.
[06:46:08] <zim> Hi all. If I $('form').submit(function (event) { what would the event.? for its action i.e. where it should post to?
[06:46:32] <seutje> event.target will be the form element
[06:47:34] <zim> so would I then have to $(event.target).attr() it?
[06:47:54] <Cork> zim: this would also be the form
[06:48:05] <Cork> so just $(this) if you want to access the form
[06:48:19] <Cork> or just this.action
[06:48:31] <Cork> $(this).prop('action')
[06:48:41] <seutje> all roads lead to the form
[06:48:53] <Cork> :)
[06:48:56] <somesomething> I have tried this http://pastebin.com/BgjpGsdp which seemed most logical
[06:49:03] <zim> so the action="http://path" is not in the event then?
[06:49:37] <seutje> somesomething: if the second is within the third, the selector won't match
[06:49:54] <seutje> gotta $(this).contents().find('#second') or some shit
[06:51:28] <seutje> zim: there's a reference to the form element, so in a way, the action is in the event
[06:51:47] <somesomething> I've tried that, both with contents/find, also with document.GetElementById etc, yet it never passes the second iframe
[06:52:01] <webkat> Hi, i have a little problem with a dropdown menu that dosent collapse after clicking on a link, the jquery script dosent run on the new page(tried an alert() in the script, but it does when you reload the page.. what is wrong?? site -> http://www.webkat.slackr.dk/
[06:52:02] <somesomething> it just stops as if there is no match to what it is waiting for
[06:52:17] <seutje> somesomething: well... I'm not too familiar with nested frame stuffs
[06:52:34] <zim> TY seutje. I just need to work out how to var url = goldenBullet :-)
[06:52:39] <seutje> could put a debugger statement in there and check it out from there
[07:04:36] <BillCriswell> I can't speak Angular.
[07:05:09] <daslicht_> arg that was a freeze
[07:06:05] <webkat> hi, i have a little problem with a menu that dosent hide/collapse when you click on a link in the menu.. the jquery script dosent run on the new page, but it run when you reload the page. please take a look http://www.webkat.slackr.dk/
[07:13:29] <zim> This is what I have come up with is there a better way? var url = $(event.currentTarget).attr('action');
[07:13:52] <zim> after $('form').submit(function (event) { event.preventDefault();
[07:15:22] <zim> webkat: use on
[07:16:14] <zim> webkat: so $("body").on('click', '.mtoggle', function() {
[07:18:11] <zim> webkat: but also make your life easy and use something like bootstrap.
[07:20:46] <logikos> from $().on('submit',function(){ HERE });  if there is more than one submit button how can i tell which button was pressed to trigger the event? say i have a button to submit changes, and another to delete an the entire object from the database etc, i need ajax to talk to the right serverside script
[07:21:25] <logikos> should i abandon on submit and instead have multipal on clicks for each button? or can i tell which button was pressed from within an on submit event?
[07:22:56] <decx> i dont think you can get it from the submit event, but i'd love to be wrong
[07:31:08] <logikos> I dont know if this behavior will be consistant accross all browsers, tested with linux mint running firefox but within the function(event){} it seems that console.log(event.originalEvent.explicitOriginalTarget.value); will give you the value of the object that triggered the submit
[07:32:21] <Elirips> Hello. Does someone know about a hide() effect that will "move" a control like a div into a "black hole" ?
[07:33:18] <Elirips> Like: The rectangle that is the div starts to shrink at the position that is nearest to the "black hole" point, also it starts moving toward this point.. hope you can imagine what I mean
[07:33:20] <logikos> i'm sorry but what kind of question is that
[07:33:22] <logikos> lol
[07:34:30] <logikos> so your looking for a javascript animiation to animate the shrinking of an object from a point closest to a specific location on the screen relative to there mouse
[07:34:32] <logikos> ?
[07:34:55] <Elirips> logikos: Yeah, its maybe not very technical.
[07:35:21] <Elirips> logikos: Like in cartoons, where things get eaten by a "black hole"
[07:36:13] <logikos> how good are you at css?
[07:36:24] <donmatthew> css pro 3.0
[07:36:55] <Elirips> logikos: something like this here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQAlGxd4AxI but not with a stadium, just with a div ;)
[07:37:22] <logikos> I dont know if something already exists to do it
[07:38:18] <logikos> i would make 4 animations, each shrinking and "sucking" the object to one of 4 different sides, then calculate if you are more above, bellow, left, or right of the point you wish it to be sucked twords and depending on that calculation trigger one of the 4 animations
[07:38:36] <logikos> it wouldnt be 100% perfect but it would work
[07:39:39] <logikos> the animations would have to be created manualy .. lookup css transform: http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transform/
[07:41:04] <logikos> the eazyest way would to be just useing a transform scale to shrink it down to nothing once it gets close to your 'back hole' object
[07:41:19] <logikos> would not animate trowrds anything would just srink out of existance
[07:41:48] <Elirips> okay, thank you for the input
[07:41:55] <Elirips> I'll give it a try
[07:42:09] <Elirips> well, have to do some math first to figure out what I actually want exactly
[07:42:12] <logikos> you might ask in #css
[07:42:16] <Elirips> thx
[07:42:18] <logikos> figuring out the best css to use is the first step
[07:42:21] <Elirips> i will
[07:42:24] <logikos> javascript can animate it
[07:42:31] <logikos> but you need to know the css first
[07:43:11] <logikos> if you are new to both css and javascript this will be an extreamly difficult task
[07:43:30] <logikos> if your a veteran, have fun trying :)
[07:43:44] <logikos> i always enjoy trying to acomplish things i havent seen done before
[07:43:58] <logikos> but i of course have my own long list of things to work on, rather than work on other peoples
[07:44:10] <logikos> unless its worth paying for, then we can talk?
[07:44:11] <logikos> lol
[08:00:28] <interop_madness> i have the problem that jQuery controls are undefined inside a callback handler of a requireJS call, but they are defined outside of it. the jquery plugins are referenced via <script> at page level, so they are definately present. any ideas?
[08:04:17] <logikos> there are people in here who know alot more than I, but if you could create a codepen.io/pen to reproduce the issue your having it would be much easier to understand what your doing and help you
[08:04:41] <logikos> try to create a simplified version of your issue that can be reproduced (such as in codepen)
[08:04:58] <logikos> if you havent used codepen before in the controls you can have it auto load jquery
[08:05:08] <logikos> just click the gear next to the javascript window
[08:05:43] <interop_madness> logikos, it's pretty hard to isolate. but the gist of it is the following:
[08:07:01] <logikos> as i said, perhaps someone in here will be able to help you easier than I can, but most problems can be simplified  into a codepen, if you do that then it allows us/me to experiement in createing a solution and we then know it works, and can even send you a link to the solution
[08:07:09] <interop_madness> <script> for jquery and kendo in the right order. require([myControl], function(){ $(selector).kendoSplitter(); });  // $.kendoSplitter is undefined
[08:07:13] <logikos> without that it will be difficult for me personaly to help you much
[08:07:21] <morfin> hmm
[08:07:26] <interop_madness> but:
[08:07:47] <interop_madness> <script> for jquery and kendo in the right order. $(selector).kendoSplitter();  // works
[08:07:58] <logikos> so your issue is within a callback function within something other than jquery?
[08:08:23] <logikos> have you tried useing jQuery() instead of $() within the callback function, perhaps something within the other plugin is overriding the $ var
[08:08:27] <interop_madness> logikos, yes, but my question is what could possibly make $.fn.whatever disappear
[08:08:42] <logikos> answer: something overriding the $ var
[08:08:48] <logikos> try useing jQuery() instead of $()
[08:08:53] <logikos> or jQuery.fn.
[08:09:26] <logikos> that is really my only guess, its worth trying
[08:09:34] <logikos> beyond that someone else will have to assist you
[08:10:23] <logikos> sometimes i do (function($){ /* its ok to use $ in here for jquery */ }(jQuery));
[08:10:42] <logikos> which is a function that will call itself, passing itself the jQuery object and assigning it to a local var $ to be used inside
[08:10:58] <logikos> if you get in the habbit of wrapping what you do in a function like that, it will also solve the problem
[08:11:03] <logikos> assuming that is your problem
[08:11:39] <logikos> did it work?
[08:14:03] <interop_madness> no, none of the suggestions worked
[08:14:15] <interop_madness> jquery works. it's the plugins that are missing
[08:14:31] <interop_madness> i can do $(selector).css(whatever)
[08:14:45] <interop_madness> but $(selector).pluginName(...) gives me the error
[08:15:05] <interop_madness> but only inside the callback. which is called after the location in the code at which it works
[08:15:18] <interop_madness> something is shadowing something
[08:24:38] <logikos> and jQuery(selector).pluginName() isnt working either?
[08:38:53] <ankurk> So I have a input field like this, <input type="text" maxlength="15" tab-index="23" value="" class="sales_order_no" > & there's a plus sign in front of it which adds exactly another input below it (with same html). How would I copy the input from the original into the appended one (and empty the original one)?
[08:45:53] <mariuscc> ankurk - use clone()
[08:51:07] <wjb> Will $(document).ready fire inside a script tag that has the async attribute?
[08:51:34] <wjb> If it is inside a script that is added to the page via script tag with the async attribute, to be more precise.
[08:52:22] <ankurk> mariuscc: thanks man! :)
[08:59:14] <retep007> Hi if you could look at http://tympanus.net/Development/BookBlock/js/jquery.bookblock.js how can I use update method in $.BookBlock.prototype if code is initialized by  $( '#bb-bookblock' ).bookblock();
[09:05:03] <retep007> anybody here ?
[09:09:52] <duch_kazatel> i'm here
[09:10:39] <rmill> HI taulant!
[09:10:51] <rmill> .flip taulant
[09:10:51] <b-ot> rmill: (╯°□°）╯︵ʇuɐןnɐʇ
[09:14:34] <retep007> could you please take look at this http://tympanus.net/Development/BookBlock/js/jquery.bookblock.js and tell me how I can use update method $.BookBlock.prototype if code is initialized by  $( '#bb-bookblock' ).bookblock();
[09:14:50] <duch_kazatel> why are you trying to update that prototype?
[09:18:19] <retep007> I have made changes in DOM after it was caled and because of that it doesnt work as supposed
[09:20:06] <retep007> Iam not well experiencied but i wanted to solve it by saving the call to function and then run on taht variable update function, but that didnt work...
[09:26:20] <duch_kazatel> why not wait until your changes are done and then init"?
[09:26:34] <duch_kazatel> that's the smart way to do it.
[09:27:09] <Kal_crunchbang> hello there when i load a page with .load it is old and not updated how can i fix this??
[09:27:22] <duch_kazatel> "it is old and not updated"?
[09:27:31] <Kal_crunchbang> same thing
[09:27:37] <duch_kazatel> same thing as what?
[09:27:53] <Kal_crunchbang> there the same thing
[09:28:10] <Kal_crunchbang> i asked for help not lovely sarcasm
[09:28:20] <duch_kazatel> your question makes absolutely no sense.
[09:28:23] <duch_kazatel> not sarcasm.
[09:28:32] <duch_kazatel> do you have a code sample?
[09:29:12] <Kal_crunchbang> when i have jquery do .load it loads an old version of the page not the one i just saved
[09:29:39] <duch_kazatel> aaaah that makes more sense.
[09:29:41] <duch_kazatel> maybe browser caching.
[09:29:45] <retep007> I am creating booklike  webpage, with dynamically loading content at the start I dont know how it will look, but I need to be that plugin runing because of list function, in plugin is also update method mean to be use for that occasion, but because of my little knowledge of jQuery I am not able to use it.
[09:29:50] <fabioportieri> any reason why .css('perspective-origin-y'); should not work? returns empty
[09:30:12] <kongthap> i saw youtube's clip when console.log(this); let's say it's a button his console got "<button>Yes</button> but mine is "[object HTMLButtonElement]" anything wrong, or it's about jquery'
[09:30:28] <kongthap> i saw youtube's clip when console.log(this); let's say it's a button his console got "<button>Yes</button> but mine is "[object HTMLButtonElement]" anything wrong, or it's about jquery version because the clip is about a year old ???
[09:30:57] <duch_kazatel> Kal_crunchbang you have two options.  1: use $.ajax() instead if you want to control cache on a per-request basis.
[09:31:03] <duch_kazatel> or 2: add this to the top of your script:
[09:31:04] <duch_kazatel> $.ajaxSetup ({cache: false});
[09:31:32] <Kal_crunchbang> ok
[09:31:52] <retep007> I thnik its kind of class and I need to store that object in variable and then call the method, that would I do in C++ but in jquery I dont know how to do that
[09:32:39] <duch_kazatel> retep007 javascript doesn't have classes - i have no idea how your plugin works, but modifying the prototype likely won't help because you're not initializing things.
[09:33:07] <duch_kazatel> kongthap no idea what you're talking about.
[09:33:35] <duch_kazatel> retep007 it sounds like what you want and what the plugin does are at odds with one another.
[09:34:04] <Kal_crunchbang> in the function or bellow <script>
[09:34:18] <duch_kazatel> Kal before that function.
[09:34:27] <duch_kazatel> Kal_crunchbang that will disable all ajax caching.
[09:34:38] <duch_kazatel> Kal_crunchbang it's a global setting that needs to only be run once.
[09:34:44] <Kal_crunchbang> ok
[09:34:50] <retep007> oh so I cant modify variables if it was once runned ?
[09:35:18] <duch_kazatel> retep007 you can modify variabled, but what you want to do will become convoluted and confusing in the long term.
[09:35:32] <duch_kazatel> *variables
[09:35:39] <Kal_crunchbang> works great
[09:35:46] <Kal_crunchbang> thank you duch_kazatel
[09:35:52] <duch_kazatel> no problem.
[09:36:21] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, let's say i try to log which object is clicked,  in side my click event is "console.log(this);" in the firefox console i got  "[object HTMLButtonElement]" but in the youtube vdo it's <button>The Button</button>
[09:36:34] <duch_kazatel> what youtube video?
[09:36:56] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kC0ONGE8Aw0&list=PL5HYRECqztWyynfrvNFr_Dbjw_d-iMBK_&index=4
[09:37:10] <duch_kazatel> at what part in the video are you talking about?>
[09:37:44] <duch_kazatel> because i'm not going to sit through 12 minutes of jquery 101 ;)
[09:38:02] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, about 5:50
[09:38:32] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, thanks for your help :P
[09:39:18] <retep007> I dont have any else opinions
[09:39:45] <duch_kazatel> retep007 could you shoot me a link to the documentation for the plugin and re-explain what you're trying to do?
[09:40:10] <petey> do functions always need to return something? http://jsfiddle.net/CVrFU/335/
[09:40:25] <petey> in this case, one of the functions returns this, the other doesn't but they both still work
[09:40:56] <duch_kazatel> petey they do not need to return something unless you need a return value.
[09:41:03] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, this is my result on the console https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61719196/57-01/014.png
[09:41:07] <petey> actually nevermind, if I don't return this for the first function, it doesn't work
[09:41:23] <duch_kazatel> kongthap I get similar results as the video.
[09:41:28] <petey> in my case, is that something that needs to return a value?
[09:42:08] <petey> duch_kazatel, figured it out. the reason why i need to return in that case is do to method chaining
[09:42:20] <duch_kazatel> kongthap shjare your code.
[09:42:24] <duch_kazatel> petey yup :)
[09:42:34] <duch_kazatel> you have to return an object if you want to chain.
[09:42:45] <petey> is that because this is being passed to the next object?
[09:42:54] <petey> is there a place i can read up on why that is the case?
[09:42:57] <kongthap> $('button').click(function() { console.log(this); }); this is my code, i also tried on chrome
[09:42:57] <duch_kazatel> the method gets run on whatever was returned.
[09:43:06] <petey> ohh ok
[09:43:13] <duch_kazatel> kongthap please create a jsfiddle with your code.
[09:43:21] <duch_kazatel> all of your code.
[09:43:24] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, ok sorry about that
[09:43:35] <duch_kazatel> it's ok, but something tells me you're doing something wrong.
[09:46:58] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, this is all my code http://jsfiddle.net/bnL5p/
[09:47:28] <mariuscc> is there possible to select somehow the 2nd and 3rd image ?
[09:48:45] <mariuscc> found it. with comma
[09:50:37] <jwmann> I'm trying to have on('click', mycustomfunction() ) where I'm able to use the 'this' variable inside 'mycustomfunction()'.. How would I accomplish this?
[09:51:04] <duch_kazatel> kongthap it's working for me.
[09:51:18] <duch_kazatel> jwmann not sure what you're asking.
[09:51:19] <jwmann> Would I do on('click', this, mycustomfunction( this )) ? :S
[09:51:52] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, may be it's about something else, thanks for your help :)
[09:51:53] <duch_kazatel> jwmann no - have some code to share?
[09:52:02] <duch_kazatel> kongthap also your code doesn't match the vide.
[09:52:16] <duch_kazatel> *video
[09:52:43] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: I'll make some example code
[09:53:52] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, i meant, when i used console.log(this) his vdo display exactly the html element but mine display just the element type it is :(
[09:54:24] <duch_kazatel> kongthap your code still does what the video does.
[09:54:36] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, it's ok i just have to give up, it's still long way to go with the rest of the vdo
[09:55:07] <duch_kazatel> jwmann are you just trying to reference whatever the event was run against?
[09:55:15] <duch_kazatel> rather, whatever emitted the event?
[09:55:23] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, my coding can do as the vdo, just different in the log's content, so i really wonder about it
[09:55:27] <duch_kazatel> kongthap wait you're using the firefox dev tools.  hrm
[09:55:51] <duch_kazatel> thaaaaaat's why.
[09:56:02] <duch_kazatel> the firefox dev tools operate a little differently to Firebug and Chrome's dev tools
[09:56:17] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, i mostly use firefox, but i also tried on chrome, it's doesn't like in the vdo anyway (os is ubuntu) jquery is 2.1.x
[09:56:22] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: Basically. Yea/
[09:56:34] <duch_kazatel> kongthap - use chrome's dev tools or install firebug.
[09:56:47] <duch_kazatel> firefox's dev tools are the "problem" in this case.
[09:57:10] <duch_kazatel> jwmann use .on('click', yourFunction(e));
[09:57:37] <duch_kazatel> then, within yourFunction, access the eventTarget property of that argument.
[09:57:41] <duch_kazatel> if you supply code I can show you hopw.
[09:59:46] <duch_kazatel> rather, the target of the argument.
[09:59:47] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, thanks i will take your advice :)
[10:02:50] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: This is what I'm trying to say - http://jsfiddle.net/z8KU2/
[10:04:04] <duch_kazatel> oh that's why.
[10:04:13] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/z8KU2/1/
[10:04:14] <duch_kazatel> :)
[10:04:30] <duch_kazatel> 1st you need to define your function before using it.
[10:04:42] <duch_kazatel> 2nd you just pass the name of the function, no parens.
[10:08:13] <duch_kazatel> jwmann did that help?
[10:11:26] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: Sorry. Had to run to the phone for a second, lemme check it out
[10:12:12] <sportman> hey how is everyone?
[10:12:15] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: Oh, really? Wow, I was just calling it incorrectly
[10:12:18] <jwmann> xD
[10:12:21] <duch_kazatel> yup
[10:12:25] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: Thanks! :)
[10:12:33] <duch_kazatel> np
[10:13:48] <duch_kazatel> sportman I'm good.  you?
[10:13:57] <sportman> not too shabby
[10:14:00] <sportman> had a ton of coffee today
[10:14:17] <duch_kazatel> nice
[10:14:22] <sportman> trying to figure out if there is a way to force ios to close safari via js
[10:14:32] <duch_kazatel> wat
[10:14:34] <sportman> top.close() closes the specific tab but i need to figure out how to quit the app out
[10:14:44] <sportman> doubt it is possible though
[10:14:52] <sportman> unless i crash the app lol
[10:14:55] <duch_kazatel> not without some kind of exploit.
[10:14:55] <sparr> sportman: if it was possible then it would be a bug
[10:14:56] <duch_kazatel> yeah...
[10:15:02] <duch_kazatel> why would you want that?
[10:15:26] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: What if I need to pass a string into my custom function, how would I do that?
[10:15:27] <sportman> stupid apple doesn't let you add events to calendar unless you open the ics file in native safari
[10:15:47] <sportman> so i have my html5 phonegap app open an external window with the ics calendar file
[10:15:48] <duch_kazatel> jwmann what's the "custom string"?
[10:16:01] <sportman> but i would want to close out safari right after they add the event to their calendar
[10:16:05] <sportman> that way they are back in my app
[10:16:05] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: Like 'foobar'
[10:16:10] <duch_kazatel> jwmann fiddle?
[10:16:11] <sportman> but yea other than an exploit probably no way around it
[10:16:19] <jwmann> kk
[10:16:26] <duch_kazatel> jwmann like, why would you need to pass an arbitrary string?
[10:16:33] <retep007> duch_kazatel: My approach is that I am using plugin from this site  http://tympanus.net/Development/BookBlock/js/jquery.bookblock.js to create booklike effect, I am initiating it with $( '#bb-bookblock' ).bookblock(); where bb-bookblock is element in dome which I want to be booklike, but page are loading dynamically while you are listing and at firt call I dont know their number or length, so I need to call update method on instance
[10:16:48] <duch_kazatel> why are you loading them dynamically?
[10:16:55] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: so the function can perform different actions based on the string passed
[10:18:02] <duch_kazatel> jwmann eh, that's going to get really confusing down the road.
[10:18:40] <duch_kazatel> retep007 https://github.com/codrops/BookBlock/issues/10
[10:19:02] <retep007> because of speed, when I loaded all at one it took about 3s at 15 article
[10:19:04] <jedimind> kill him vladikoff
[10:19:09] <jedimind> with extreme prejudice
[10:19:32] <duch_kazatel> retep007 i just linked you to the github issue that addresses this issue.
[10:19:43] <duch_kazatel> it shows up how to update the page list.
[10:20:18] <retep007> Thanks a lot, testing now
[10:23:15] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: It's not too crazy, only 2 different actions
[10:23:34] <duch_kazatel> jwmann eh, i'd abstract out with decorators at that point.
[10:24:28] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: Thing is, the actions are so similar, they require the same variables to work, literally 1 line difference.
[10:24:55] <jwmann> I feel as making two unique functions would be redundant at that point
[10:25:11] <jwmann> or anonymous functions
[10:25:26] <duch_kazatel> i'd make 2 new functions that both call the current one.
[10:25:35] <duch_kazatel> or find a different way to determine the differet behavior.
[10:26:02] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: Hmm, that'd be okay
[10:26:07] <duch_kazatel> api.jquery.com/on/#passing-data
[10:26:10] <duch_kazatel> this is your other choice
[10:28:49] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: Hmmm, so it looks like it has to be an array otherwise it acts as a selector..
[10:29:13] <duch_kazatel> huh?  no, it needs to be an object.
[10:30:48] <duch_kazatel> but yeah if you use a string instead it'll try to bind it using the delegation syntax
[10:39:50] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: Yea, that's a bit weird way of doing it haha
[10:40:35] <jwmann> It essentially passes the whole event with and inputs that object in the data: part
[10:42:01] <duch_kazatel> it seems strange, but really only because of what you're doing ;)
[10:42:33] <jwmann> Yea, I suppose it would make more sense using an actual object rather than just passing a string
[10:42:44] <duch_kazatel> YUP
[10:42:46] <duch_kazatel> *yup
[10:43:14] <duch_kazatel> plus you're more likely to use event delegation than pass around some arbitrary string.
[10:44:13] <Guest99210> Hi, I have many boxes in a page. each with a fixed / non-fixed width/height. If a box is inside another box but its width is => than the width of its parent box, the width of parent box should increase. This should happen to all boxes. http://jsfiddle.net/px4ke/  any clue?
[10:45:28] <jmpdev> how do you call trigger on an event with selector?
[10:45:39] <duch_kazatel> jmpdev huh?
[10:45:46] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to trigger an event on something?
[10:46:10] <jmpdev> yeah, but it's ajax loaded
[10:46:23] <duch_kazatel> jmpdev are you trying to bind or trigger?
[10:46:33] <jmpdev> i'm trying to trigger
[10:46:34] <kongthap> how can make this become an object -> $('script')[1] so i can apply chaining on it???
[10:46:45] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: Yea, I'm going to do it with an anonymous function and calling my custom one within it
[10:46:50] <duch_kazatel> .trigger() should work after the element has been added to the document.
[10:46:58] <Guest99210> looks difficult . right?
[10:47:11] <Guest99210> the code is ok though.
[10:47:17] <Guest99210> I wonder what went wrong
[10:47:18] <duch_kazatel> kongthap you have to re-jquerify it - $($('script')[1])
[10:47:33] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 your description hardly makes sense.
[10:47:39] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, that's great :)
[10:48:08] <jmpdev> duch_kazatel: I have it bound as such $(".app").on("click", ".mytarget" -> i'd like to trigger click on .mytarget
[10:48:29] <duch_kazatel> kongthap you should cache your selectors, so you do var aScript = $('script')[1]; then do $(aScript) in your code elsewhgere.
[10:48:44] <duch_kazatel> jmpdev then just trigger it.
[10:48:56] <duch_kazatel> $('.mytarget').trigger('click);
[10:49:03] <duch_kazatel> err, .trigger('click');
[10:49:07] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  see the gray boxes. if the child box  has =< width than the width of its parent. the parant should expand width to compensate the child box. so that the child box shows itself INSIDE the parent. not overflowing out of it.
[10:49:23] <duch_kazatel> you mean >=
[10:49:29] <duch_kazatel> greater than or equal to.
[10:50:05] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  i mean <=
[10:50:16] <Guest99210> sory
[10:50:18] <duch_kazatel> you mean less than or equal to?
[10:50:24] <Guest99210> >= greater than or eqaul to
[10:50:26] <duch_kazatel> also, your code is invalid.
[10:50:35] <duch_kazatel> line 2 is broken.
[10:51:03] <Guest99210> var parentWidth = $(this).parents.(".box").first().attr('width');
[10:51:06] <Guest99210> seems perfect..
[10:51:08] <duch_kazatel> that's not valid.
[10:51:17] <Guest99210> am. whats bad in it?
[10:51:24] <duch_kazatel> open your console.
[10:51:29] <Guest99210> hm
[10:51:37] <duch_kazatel> var parentWidth = $(this).parents(".box").first().attr('width');
[10:51:42] <duch_kazatel> you had an extra period.
[10:53:22] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, if i catch the object is it wrong in concept??? e.g. var an_object = $($('script')[0])
[10:53:42] <duch_kazatel> kongthap you can do that, too.
[10:54:33] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel, fixed it
[10:54:38] <Guest99210> var parentWidth = $(this).parents(".box").first().attr('width');
[10:54:48] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 i'm fixing this for you.
[10:54:53] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  ok
[10:55:17] <duch_kazatel> long story short, you're not doing anything right ;)
[10:55:21] <duch_kazatel> do you use the console at all?
[10:55:25] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, so just depends on which is more convenient in specific case right?
[10:55:38] <duch_kazatel> kongthap i'd cache each selector individually, but that's mne,
[10:55:39] <duch_kazatel> *me
[10:56:07] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  now i think i always should
[10:58:05] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 just to clarify - if the child is wider than its parent, the parent element's width should expand, right?
[10:58:18] <Guest99210> yes. wider or ==
[10:58:39] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/px4ke/4/
[10:58:40] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[10:58:44] <duch_kazatel> that does exactly what you're asking.
[10:58:45] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  I just dont want any child to get out of the parent
[10:58:53] <duch_kazatel> though it'll have no impact on your current code.
[10:59:08] <Es0teric> ok so i have a question
[10:59:34] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 you're comparing widths.  that has nothing to do with what you really want I think.
[10:59:51] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric ?
[10:59:55] <Guest99210> am , then what do I want?
[11:00:05] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  http://jsfiddle.net/px4ke/4/   has not changed anything
[11:00:16] <Es0teric> i want something similar to parallax scrolling… but when the user clicks "up" or "down" it fades the divs in and out
[11:00:27] <Es0teric> very simple… not complex
[11:00:30] <duch_kazatel> yes it has - that's valid code that does exactly what you asked.  what you asked and what you want are different.
[11:00:43] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 - why can't you use CSS for this?
[11:01:03] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  the boxes on the page , each box has a different width
[11:01:24] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 no they don't  your CSS sets them to the same size.
[11:01:39] <duch_kazatel> one is offset by the other's padding, but the widths are identical.
[11:01:50] <duch_kazatel> remove your max-width property in your CSS>
[11:01:55] <duch_kazatel> that'll do what you really want.
[11:02:04] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  some boxes are expanded auto matically due to adding more elements in them (those which never had a width property ever defined in their css). some have fixed width.
[11:02:16] <duch_kazatel> don't use the max-width property like that.
[11:02:30] <duch_kazatel> that'll prevent your parent from being able to contain its children.
[11:02:38] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  yes. padding is another issue. thats why , if you observe, I added + 30
[11:02:56] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  I  have to use max-width for certain reasons
[11:04:06] <duch_kazatel> your calculations still aren't doing what you want.
[11:05:27] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel did you see what i wrote?
[11:05:45] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric yeah, you'll have to modify something out there.
[11:06:06] <duch_kazatel> i don't know of anythving that does that out of the box, but i'm not an encyclopedia of plugins :)
[11:06:36] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel well technically it would function LIKE parallax scrolling
[11:06:50] <duch_kazatel> still not of much help I'm afraid.
[11:06:56] <duch_kazatel> you don't want parallax scrolling ;)
[11:06:58] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  how can it be done in jquery?
[11:09:10] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 I basically gave you the answer ;)_
[11:10:01] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  ya but how to change the width of the parent?
[11:10:06] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/px4ke/6/
[11:10:23] <duch_kazatel> you need to use .css and modify the width AND max-width
[11:10:51] <Guest99210> hm
[11:11:06] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  why not do it without css.
[11:11:19] <duch_kazatel> max-width means that element can be NO WIDER than a certain value.
[11:11:25] <duch_kazatel> because there's no other way?
[11:12:07] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  the jQuery .width()  cant be changed? thats irrelavent from css
[11:12:14] <duch_kazatel> that changes the CSS>
[11:12:21] <duch_kazatel> that adds an inline-style for the width property.
[11:12:31] <duch_kazatel> which still doesn't change the max-width.
[11:12:35] <duch_kazatel> that's still your problem.
[11:12:53] <duch_kazatel> you're asking "how can i make something wider than the max width?"
[11:12:57] <duch_kazatel> you can't.,
[11:13:20] <Guest99210> hm
[11:13:21] <Guest99210> ok
[11:13:48] <Guest99210> why did you made -60 in  parentWidth = $this.parent('.box').width() - 60,
[11:14:00] <duch_kazatel> because the padding is 30px on each side.
[11:14:05] <duch_kazatel> you were only accounting for one side.
[11:14:11] <duch_kazatel> 30 + 30 = 60
[11:14:13] <Guest99210> hm
[11:14:22] <duch_kazatel> try changing that to 30 and see what happens ;)
[11:14:24] <Guest99210> got it.
[11:14:52] <Guest99210> thanks!
[11:14:58] <duch_kazatel> sure
[11:18:49] <kongthap> this return all data attribute -> $('p').data() what if i want only the first data attribute without knowing it's name how to ???
[11:19:22] <duch_kazatel> kongthap code sample?
[11:21:24] <kongthap> this is p tag <p data-name="kongthap" data-surname="thammachat">Developer Name</p> if i don't know what  are data-xxx how to get  kongthap, thammachat ???
[11:21:54] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/43CXn/
[11:22:02] <duch_kazatel> like that.
[11:22:57] <duch_kazatel> though that defeats the purpose of data attributes.
[11:23:56] <duch_kazatel> why have them if you're not going to use them right?
[11:27:00] <duch_kazatel> welp that was fun.
[11:28:20] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, still learning jquery 101 so trying to dig into whatever i can :P
[11:28:37] <duch_kazatel> kongthap don't use data attributes like that in the real world.
[11:28:46] <duch_kazatel> also: learn javascript as well.
[11:29:18] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, i'm learning both at the same time that's why bad performance right now
[11:30:53] <duch_kazatel> that's not just bad performance, it doesn't make sense.
[11:30:57] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, your coding should loops 2 times because you have 2 data attribute, i expect your code to display ninja and butts
[11:31:17] <duch_kazatel> nope.  it loops oce.
[11:31:19] <duch_kazatel> *once
[11:32:17] <duch_kazatel> I'm saying "for each property on this object, test if it's apart of that object and not a prototype.  if it is, print it and then break the loop."
[11:32:21] <kongthap> var dataObj = $('div').data(); it's just one single object right? it's not like an array
[11:32:32] <duch_kazatel> objects can be looped over.
[11:32:57] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/43CXn/1/
[11:33:58] <duch_kazatel> the enumeration loops through each property.
[11:34:07] <duch_kazatel> datObj has 2 properties.
[11:34:27] <duch_kazatel> i do a loop and grab the first one then abort.
[11:37:27] <BillCriswell> Angular's learning curve is pretty steep thus far.
[11:39:18] <dp> I'm doing a $(selector).append("<p>Some text</p>"). what's the best way to then remove said node after 2 seconds?
[11:39:36] <duch_kazatel> remove or hide?
[11:39:37] <dp> better question, is there a way to do it via chaining directly?
[11:39:42] <dp> duch_kazatel: either, honestly
[11:40:55] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to use settimeout. have a fiddle?
[11:41:25] <dp> nothing concrete yet
[11:41:40] <duch_kazatel> okay.  i'll do your legwork for you then ;)_
[11:42:08] <kongthap> duch_kazatel, i got it now, because of your code guide
[11:42:58] <duch_kazatel> cool.
[11:43:03] <duch_kazatel> dp - http://jsfiddle.net/e5B4Q/
[11:43:09] <duch_kazatel> that's one way to do it.
[11:54:32] <dp> duch_away: thanks. you gave me just what I needed
[11:57:37] <TheEternalAbyss> hello, I was wondering if I could ask for a recommendation:  I have a <select> with several <options> a user can choose. I've been trying to figure out a way to traverse all the child elements of the select in order to put the values in an array. I've played with children() and find() but it only returns the first child element found. any advice?
[11:58:29] <tandroid> You need .each()
[11:59:56] <tandroid> $("select").find("option").each(function{ do stuff here using $(this) to get each element });
[12:01:31] <TheEternalAbyss> ah
[12:01:39] <TheEternalAbyss> nice. Ok i'll give it a go. thank you much
[12:01:46] <tandroid> No problem
[12:03:52] <krenner> Hello, i have problem with compatibility. It's about width() applied on button
[12:04:00] <kongthap> console.log($('li:first-child').outerHTML()); cannot get outerHTML from the selector, i got undefined instead, this is the outerHTML looks like console.log($('li:first-child').outerHTML());
[12:04:29] <shoky> there's no outerHTML method
[12:04:36] <shoky> you can use .prop('outerHTML') tho
[12:04:50] <krenner> it is working perfectly fine on linux - opera. but not on windows firefox
[12:05:13] <shoky> jquery doesn't have an outerHTML method
[12:05:20] <shoky> oh wrong person, sry
[12:06:19] <tandroid> krenner: Different browsers apply different styling to buttons if that's what you're noticing?
[12:06:32] <krenner> yes, i think so
[12:07:02] <krenner> is it possible to get width of button with border and everything ?
[12:07:02] <tandroid> Yet another reason to normalize
[12:07:34] <krenner> i'm placing buttons in a row  using .width() + 3
[12:07:39] <shoky> krenner try .outerWidth()
[12:07:58] <shoMo> ls
[12:08:11] <krenner> sounds satisfactorily
[12:08:20] <shoky> xD
[12:08:56] <shoky> krenner also learn about box-sizing:border-box
[12:09:03] <shoky> ?g paul irish box sizing
[12:09:05] <b-ot> shoky: * { box-sizing: border-box } FTW - Paul Irish → http://paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/
[12:09:20] <krenner> thank you :)
[12:09:21] <shoky> if you use that, .width() will already include border
[12:09:29] <shoky> and everything will be easier, mostly
[12:12:18] <raj> yo shoky
[12:12:36] <shoky> ey
[12:12:38] <shoky> sup raj
[12:13:01] <raj> nm, home early from work
[12:13:26] <shoky> back to crazy hours?
[12:13:46] <raj> I was, up till past friday
[12:14:03] <raj> gonna have a little more laid back schedule for a couple weeks
[12:14:21] <shoky> my kind of schedule
[12:14:49] <raj> ya, that's what we actually call it at work too
[12:14:54] <raj> shoky schedule
[12:14:57] <shoky> ;D
[12:18:09] <lundy> anyone recommend a plugin to edit table cells? just want to double click on the cell and be able to change the Start Time and End Time
[12:19:03] <cortexman> question - is it possible to scroll to a particular element of a jquery-ui combobox? i'm interested in having multiple combobox scroll together -i.e., when you scroll one, it scrolls the others
[12:21:35] <raj> why can't I find any browser compatibility for ajax's type='PUT'?
[12:22:39] <shoky> i think any modern browser will be fine with it raj
[12:22:46] <shoky> even IE7 prolly
[12:22:52] <shoky> and i'd guess IE6 too
[12:23:03] <raj> wow, ok
[12:23:09] <shoky> maybe not for cross-domain tho, i donno
[12:23:21] <raj> then jquery probably doesn't need that note in their docs
[12:24:29] <shoky> i might be wrong about it btw ;p
[12:25:06] <duch_kazatel> goooooooood afternoon.
[12:25:39] <raj> lol
[12:27:08] <BillCriswell> it is after noon isn't it
[12:27:24] <BillCriswell> Fuck I need to focus more.
[12:30:56] <Es0teric> has anyone here used stellar.js?
[12:33:06] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: I've seen it before... not sure if I've used it or not.
[12:33:43] <Es0teric> BillCriswell i see.. because i am trying to create a parallax scrolling effect and i am not sure if i am supposed to add the entire body with a slide or if i can just target a div only
[12:36:45] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric you said earlier you want divs to fade in and out, not do parallax scrolling.
[12:36:51] <duch_kazatel> i'm confused :(
[12:37:00] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel well i changed my mind, i decided to do a parallax effect
[12:37:04] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[12:37:08] <duch_kazatel> fair enough
[12:38:07] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel well you know, it seems to be a easier option than just creating something that is *LIKE* it
[12:48:53] <Evo> I've created this simple tool to help in a game, although I'm a complete newb to javascript and jQuery. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54758416/CIVCHECK/index.html As you can see the page loads very slowly. Is there a less intesive way to achieve the same goal? Here is the js: http://pastebin.com/3wuLiHng
[12:49:39] <duch_kazatel> you mean havig a click toggle a div?
[12:50:08] <Evo> yeah
[12:50:14] <duch_kazatel> yeah - i'll show you.
[12:50:27] <Evo> Awesome thanks
[12:51:44] <Es0teric> ok i keep getting these errors on JSLint like "window" was used before it was defined, "jQuery was used before it was defined"
[12:51:47] <Es0teric> i dont get it
[12:51:53] <Es0teric> i clearly defined them
[12:52:13] <duch_kazatel> Evo http://jsfiddle.net/G63r3/
[12:52:15] <duch_kazatel> try that.
[12:52:24] <duch_kazatel> instead of all the .click functions.
[12:52:36] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric how did you define them?
[12:52:48] <cortexman> $("select option:nth-child(2)").attr("selected", true)
[12:52:50] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel well window is a global var, right?
[12:52:56] <duch_kazatel> only in browsers.
[12:52:59] <cortexman> why does this set selected="selected" instead of selected=true?
[12:53:05] <duch_kazatel> jslint doesnt't assume you're in a browser.
[12:53:22] <duch_kazatel> try putting this in the beginning: /*global window */
[12:54:00] <Es0teric> yeah i did that but there are like 9 other error
[12:54:00] <Es0teric> s
[12:54:01] <Es0teric> =_=
[12:54:02] <duch_kazatel> cortexman that looks wrong.  try wrapping "true" in quotes.
[12:54:09] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric search around on google.
[12:54:32] <cortexman> "true" isn't a boolean
[12:54:43] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  just for learning and a confusion now. http://jsfiddle.net/px4ke/7/   why is this not working?
[12:54:45] <duch_kazatel> in that case it is.
[12:54:48] <cortexman> no..
[12:54:53] <cortexman> false unsets it
[12:55:04] <cortexman> true and "true" set selected="selected"
[12:55:06] <duch_kazatel> let me clarify - i don't know that you can use a boolean in "attr"
[12:55:09] <cortexman> "false" does not unset it
[12:55:13] <Es0teric> this freakin JSLint thing is bogus man
[12:55:13] <duch_kazatel> have some code?
[12:55:22] <Evo> Wow, thanks duch_kazatel. It loads much faster!
[12:55:29] <cortexman> $("select option:nth-child(2)").attr("selected",false) // this unsets selected
[12:55:38] <cortexman> $("select option:nth-child(2)").attr("selected",true) // this sets selected="selected"
[12:56:06] <duch_kazatel> cortexman a working jsfiddle would be fantastic.
[12:56:25] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 did you open your console?
[12:58:07] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  i did. no error
[12:58:15] <duch_kazatel> i'm seeing an error.
[12:58:36] <duch_kazatel> try mousing over with the console open.
[12:58:55] <cortexman> how about this..
[12:59:07] <cortexman> using a jquery ui combobox, how do I scroll to a numeric index in the list of options
[12:59:22] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  wait
[12:59:26] <duch_kazatel> i don't really know much about jquery ui.
[12:59:32] <shoky> what's a jquery ui combobox
[12:59:33] <duch_kazatel> cortexman why can't you get a simple fiddle?
[13:00:01] <duch_kazatel> because as far as I know, you can't use true (the boolean) as a vallue for attr.  but you can use "true" (the string"
[13:00:05] <duch_kazatel> *)
[13:00:07] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  http://jsfiddle.net/px4ke/9/
[13:00:17] <shoky> you want to set the "selected" property anyway, not the attribute
[13:00:20] <shoky> cortexman ^
[13:00:27] <shoky> assuming a regular <select>
[13:00:38] <cortexman> i tried both.
[13:00:40] <cortexman> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox
[13:00:46] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 and also, setting "max-width" to auto doesn't do anything
[13:00:59] <cortexman> if you click the combobox, and then write a chrome console snippet that scrolls to a particular index, that would work for me as well
[13:01:17] <duch_kazatel> wat
[13:01:21] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  it does in the css editor of firebug
[13:02:05] <duch_kazatel> no.  see tha red outline on that value when editing?  that means that's an invalid value.
[13:02:06] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  add max-width: auto; in the css style editor to the parent box and see it expands.
[13:02:09] <duch_kazatel> you have to use "none"
[13:02:27] <duch_kazatel> when you do an invalid style like that, it removes that entire propery.
[13:02:36] <shoky> cortexman ok that's not a regular <select>
[13:02:43] <cortexman> nope
[13:02:44] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  oh ok
[13:02:45] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/px4ke/10/
[13:02:45] <shoky> and they don't really have a "combobox"
[13:02:55] <shoky> as they say, that's just a demonstration of something you can do with the autocomplete widget
[13:02:57] <cortexman> i can't figure out how to focus().blur() an indexed element
[13:02:58] <shoky> and it's not complete
[13:03:02] <cortexman> ….how is that helpful
[13:03:26] <duch_kazatel> how is what helpful?
[13:05:14] <duch_kazatel> oh, the sample code?
[13:06:04] <cortexman> no, quoting the documentation stating its incomplete
[13:06:32] <cortexman> anyways, a one-liner that can make that thing scroll to a particular option is what i'm trying to achieve.
[13:07:05] <duch_kazatel> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox is not the documentation.  http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/ is.
[13:07:18] <duch_kazatel> you want a particular option selected, right?
[13:08:35] <cortexman> yeah, scroll to, i.e., option 5
[13:09:01] <cortexman> right now i'm looking at this line of code, and trying to figure out how to call it outside of an event this._trigger( "select", event, { item: ui.item.option });
[13:09:26] <duch_kazatel> a fiddle would still be amazing because i get the sense that what you're working with does not reflect this page.
[13:09:46] <cortexman> i'm using this code..
[13:09:53] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  this is fishy, http://jsfiddle.net/px4ke/11/        now what ever box i mouse over. its css is made to max-width: auto;.  despite it has or has not a child box......
[13:11:19] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 you're not checking what you think you are there.  you're checking if it has a length property, not the value of the length property
[13:11:24] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/px4ke/12/
[13:11:25] <duch_kazatel> try that
[13:12:08] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  super.
[13:12:18] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  dont you think jQuery and JS are out of consistancy
[13:12:21] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 do you understand what I did?
[13:12:24] <duch_kazatel> and no, I don't.
[13:12:31] <duch_kazatel> jQuery IS javascript.
[13:12:48] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  yes
[13:13:02] <Guest99210> jQuery is a framework and has its own consistancy
[13:13:10] <duch_kazatel> it has some idioms.
[13:13:11] <Guest99210> you did a > 0
[13:13:15] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[13:13:38] <duch_kazatel> try console.log($(this).children(".box").length);
[13:13:40] <duch_kazatel> see what that is.
[13:13:55] <Guest99210> ok. can I replace mouseenter   with some on doc load.  I have to  mouseenter   every box to see its effect. I just want it to happen once for all boxes
[13:14:37] <duch_kazatel> not that easily.
[13:15:09] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  am.. no?
[13:15:28] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 because then $(this) is a very different thing.
[13:15:30] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  why so. there are  on mouseenter   and on click events.
[13:15:51] <duch_kazatel> sure - and when you fire on this events, $(this) is the element the event fired on.
[13:16:03] <duch_kazatel> what do you thing $(this) will be when it's document ready?
[13:16:28] <paulvd> hello, trying to move the headings above the div but its moving both headings... http://jsfiddle.net/z8jj6/
[13:16:53] <paulvd> updated . http://jsfiddle.net/z8jj6/1/
[13:17:09] <duch_kazatel> paulvd you're tyring to move both headings above?
[13:17:21] <duch_kazatel> paulvd could you clarify your question?>
[13:17:44] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  do that for all boxes when doc is ready.   as  $(document).on('documentReady', '.box', function(e) {
[13:17:46] <paulvd> yes
[13:18:00] <paulvd> trying to move both headings above
[13:18:14] <paulvd> its happening but then its moving both in same div
[13:18:22] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 for what?
[13:18:33] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 how about you try.
[13:18:36] <duch_kazatel> see how far you can get.
[13:18:50] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 because that syntax won't work.
[13:20:15] <duch_kazatel> paulvd "move both headings above" what?
[13:20:21] <cohitre> paulvd: so you want to move each h3 before it's corresponding div.a?
[13:20:43] <cohitre> think about it in terms of each div.a instead of thinking about each h3.
[13:21:44] <paulvd> ok managed to do it...
[13:25:13] <shoMo> ls
[13:25:18] <shoMo> clear
[13:25:41] <duch_kazatel> ls
[13:25:42] <duch_kazatel> clear
[13:26:21] <TheEternalAbyss> ok this may be a silly question.. why does $foo = array(); produce an error?
[13:26:37] <duch_kazatel> what is array()?
[13:27:07] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to make a new array, TheEternalAbyss?
[13:27:24] <TheEternalAbyss> yes. I want an empty array
[13:27:25] <shoky> indeed a silly question.. talk of an error without stating which error
[13:27:32] <duch_kazatel> then do foo = [];
[13:27:37] <duch_kazatel> use an array literal
[13:27:45] <TheEternalAbyss> syntax error
[13:27:51] <TheEternalAbyss> ah ok, thanks
[13:27:59] <duch_kazatel> yeah use an array literal.
[13:28:01] <duch_kazatel> be a gangster.
[13:28:05] <TheEternalAbyss> lol
[13:28:09] <shoky> code js in js, not php
[13:28:18] <TheEternalAbyss> oh Christ...
[13:28:24] <TheEternalAbyss> yea it's time to go home
[13:28:31] <TheEternalAbyss> wtf lol
[13:28:46] <TheEternalAbyss> that's right i'm coding in js right now hahahahaha
[13:28:55] <shoky> ;p
[13:34:51] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  it was working fine on the fiddle. but not on my page..   http://jsfiddle.net/px4ke/14/embedded/result/
[13:36:15] <duch_kazatel> oh you're this guy.
[13:36:18] <duch_kazatel> i remember this think.
[13:36:19] <duch_kazatel> *thing
[13:36:32] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  remembered?
[13:36:41] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  did any one talked about this before too?
[13:37:10] <duch_kazatel> i remember this interface.
[13:37:19] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  hm..must be a team mate.
[13:37:43] <Es0teric> this is strange, stellarjs isnt working...
[13:37:53] <Es0teric> i dont understand, i am targeting an element
[13:37:58] <duch_kazatel> you've got all kinds of JS errors Guest99210
[13:38:02] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric what was your issue?
[13:38:31] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  I really cant firue out why this does not works on the actual page but on jsfiddle. same classes, same jquery code
[13:38:55] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel, ya, its under development. but the said issue should be resoved
[13:38:55] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 dunno.  something is conflicting or is different.
[13:39:19] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 you should not have those kinds of error right now.  resolve them first.
[13:39:35] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel well i am trying to get parallax scrolling on one element
[13:39:42] <Es0teric> a container if you will
[13:39:45] <Es0teric> not the entire window
[13:40:16] <duch_kazatel> ok?
[13:40:50] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  most are network errors.
[13:41:06] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  one is for blur.js,  that .js is not loaded. so we are clean at the moment
[13:41:13] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 I can't troubleshoot for you if there are errors.
[13:41:25] <duch_kazatel> i don't have time to dump through your entire interface anyway
[13:41:26] <duch_kazatel> sooo...
[13:41:27] <duch_kazatel> sorry?
[13:41:36] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  np. let me clean
[13:41:51] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 like i said I can't be of much help at the moment.
[13:42:00] <duch_kazatel> that's going to take much more effort than I can invest.
[13:43:41] <ShawnRisk> How do I change this: $('#desc #title').text($('#playlist').find('a').data('title')); to display an image instead that is /images/Clockwork_Titile.png?
[13:45:21] <duch_kazatel> "to display an image instead"?
[13:45:45] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk you mean instead of setting text, add an image tag?
[13:49:05] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  cleaned up all  http://jsfiddle.net/px4ke/17/embedded/result/
[13:49:07] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: yes
[13:49:40] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 did you NOT read what I said?
[13:50:03] <duch_kazatel> I'm not going to be ableto dump through this much stuff to figure it out.
[13:51:03] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk try something like .append('<img src="yourImageHere.png" />');
[13:51:07] <duch_kazatel> instead of that .text.
[13:51:20] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: okay let me try
[13:51:42] <duch_kazatel> that might not work depending on what the selector is targeting, but it should help.
[13:52:07] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 is your problem still that it doesn't run on pageload btw?
[13:52:20] <duch_kazatel> because i don't recall seeing you figured that out.
[13:55:27] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  well I have deleted ALL the boxes except ONE box now. now we are to the point. http://jsfiddle.net/px4ke/18/embedded/result/
[13:55:30] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  no.
[13:55:37] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  the problem is not about page load
[13:55:39] <Tomashe> Hey guys, i was createing 4 .js files . in each wrap code with (document).ready... . on the first js file i set a var url = 'x', my last .js file using that "url" varible . but it give me error "url is not defined"
[13:55:41] <Tomashe> anyideas?
[13:56:00] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  the issue is that the parent box is not set to css max-width: none on my page
[13:56:30] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe because the var is getting defined in a function.  need to define it outside of that function.
[13:56:33] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  see the "abc" title box that is above the "hh"
[13:57:26] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 i'm not dumping through your JS and CSS files.
[13:58:22] <decx> that guestname rings about. so technology did you choose for your drawing startup :D
[13:58:27] <decx> a bell*
[13:58:50] <decx> damn it i cant write today. when you'Re missing words in sentences you know it's time for a break
[13:59:06] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  no need to dump the css. http://oi60.tinypic.com/v8kjq.jpg
[13:59:07] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 abstract out your code for the resize and paste it into the javascript tab in the fiddle.
[13:59:17] <duch_kazatel> JUST the resize.
[14:00:12] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  yes. just the resize of width is the issue
[14:00:35] <juchipilo> guys.. if i have a set of jqueryui tabs. and i have a form in the current tab. and i want to submit it via ajax, and refresh the content of the panel with the post results.. how cain i do that?
[14:01:04] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 could you put that code in the javascript pane of that fiddle instead?
[14:01:54] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: that works but what if I want three different images that change when I click a link?  Where should I put the img tag?
[14:02:01] <duch_kazatel> juchipilo use an $.ajax() that submits and then replace the contents of the tab in the .complete() callback.
[14:02:11] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk could you fiddle that out?
[14:03:02] <juchipilo> duch_kazatel,   the replacing of the contents is what i have not been able to acomplish..  what should i do for that?
[14:03:11] <duch_kazatel> .html() :)
[14:03:21] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  ok, deleted all the irrelevent css too. http://jsfiddle.net/px4ke/19/
[14:03:49] <duch_kazatel> wtf where is the javscript?
[14:03:49] <juchipilo> duch_kazatel,     ok..
[14:03:51] <juchipilo> thanks
[14:04:13] <duch_kazatel> *sigh* Guest99210 seriously?
[14:04:32] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  http://jsfiddle.net/px4ke/20   has the JS in the JS pane
[14:04:53] <decx> you opened pandorras box
[14:05:45] <duch_kazatel> holy christ
[14:05:54] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: I can show you a live example
[14:06:13] <decx> now they're coming from all sides
[14:06:50] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 did you even try man?
[14:07:04] <duch_kazatel> adding in console.log($(this).children('.box').length); after that mousenter shows "0"
[14:08:02] <duch_kazatel> yeha your code was different. replace .children() with .find()
[14:08:15] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk how much stuff is on the page?
[14:08:35] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  "your code was different. replace .children() with .find()" ?
[14:08:54] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 your sampel HTML from earlier was different from what's in your live example.
[14:09:10] <duch_kazatel> replace if ($(this).children(".box").length > 0) { with if ($(this).find(".box").length > 0) {
[14:09:10] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  both had classes named .box
[14:09:36] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 correct, but this new version has the child element down further than the prior.
[14:09:45] <duch_kazatel> .children() is for direct descendents.
[14:09:50] <duch_kazatel> .find() does a deep search.
[14:10:27] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  well, the parent would/should be resized even if it has 1 child. so children() should also work.
[14:10:33] <duch_kazatel> no.
[14:10:42] <duch_kazatel> because .children() does not search deep enough.
[14:10:59] <duch_kazatel> trust me.
[14:11:00] <duch_kazatel> use .find()
[14:11:04] <duch_kazatel> it works.
[14:11:10] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: not much
[14:11:19] <dpolivy> Hi folks. I'm running into some issues with history.back() on Android 2.x and the expected popstate event not firing with jQuery Mobile. Anyone familiar with popstate on android? More details here: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/closing-the-new-dialog-in-1-4
[14:11:24] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk let's try it then.
[14:11:43] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: http://www.wadevs.com/Music
[14:11:54] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  I agree with you but just asking for concepts
[14:12:07] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  well, the parent would/should be resized even if it has 1 child. so children() should also work.   I dont need deep search.........
[14:12:09] <Guest99210> do i?
[14:12:46] <duch_kazatel> .children() would work if the .box class was always a direct descendent.  in your case, it is not.
[14:12:52] <duch_kazatel> it might be 2 or more levels deep.
[14:13:03] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk okay.  now what?
[14:13:34] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: You will be able to click links to the right of the animation image under the logo and they will appear below the rotating image like the first image is now.
[14:13:42] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  oh. you mean  it has a .box-body in the middle too
[14:14:00] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 correct - that sites "between" the nodes.
[14:14:03] <Guest99210> .box > box-body > .box
[14:14:06] <Guest99210> hm
[14:14:09] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[14:14:22] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk i don't see anything to the right.  only the left.
[14:14:41] <Guest99210> if it was  .box> .box> .box> .box            children () would have worked for deep levels?
[14:14:56] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 only for one level.
[14:15:04] <duch_kazatel> .children() goes 1 level.
[14:15:08] <duch_kazatel> only 1 level.
[14:15:19] <duch_kazatel> only direct descendents.  how is that not making sense?
[14:15:46] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  hm
[14:15:57] <ShawnRisk>  duch_kazatel: oh right to the left, sorry
[14:16:06] <Guest99210> find() is for children replacement            what is for parents() / parent() ?
[14:16:49] <duch_kazatel> .parent() is one level up, parents() many levels up.
[14:17:30] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  so parents() goes deep
[14:17:37] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  last thing. Is there a way to do the said functionality for all boxes on page load? I dont want the requirment for it to resize on mouseovers only
[14:17:40] <duch_kazatel> I wouldn't say "deep"
[14:17:42] <duch_kazatel> but sure.
[14:17:51] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  deep up.
[14:17:56] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel ok so i have this http://jsfiddle.net/v9W9Q/4/ i am trying to make the divs slide down or up when the arrow is clicked…. i have jquery easing
[14:18:05] <duch_kazatel> lol those terms are at odds with one another.
[14:18:20] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 I asked you about your pageload thing earlier.  if you want to do that, it's a different beast.
[14:18:42] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  I was thinking to do it. how can it be done?
[14:18:48] <duch_kazatel> link the fiddle again.
[14:18:52] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  do i need a foreach loop for each box?
[14:19:02] <duch_kazatel> that will be part of it, yes.
[14:19:09] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  http://jsfiddle.net/px4ke/12
[14:19:42] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: you see that?
[14:19:56] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk I'm helpign Guest99210 at the moment - one sec :)
[14:20:05] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: okay thanks
[14:21:04] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 here's the simple version: http://jsfiddle.net/px4ke/21/
[14:21:18] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk could you fiddle your specific question out instead?
[14:22:06] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  http://jsfiddle.net/px4ke/22/
[14:22:08] <groundup> With jQuery UI Autocomplete widget, can you nest categories?
[14:22:34] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 did you want document ready or not?
[14:22:56] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: why?  This is easy to see, the list that starts with Clockwork, if I click any of these, I want an image to show up for them where Clockwork Ft. Phlo is now.
[14:22:57] <duch_kazatel> wtf is this?
[14:23:00] <lukey> jquery mobile questions ok here?
[14:23:07] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  yes. doc ready
[14:23:19] <duch_kazatel> Guest99210 then go to the jquery docs.
[14:23:22] <duch_kazatel> you keep changing what you want.
[14:23:28] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk link again then?
[14:23:36] <duch_kazatel> because apparently this is SO SIMPLE ;)
[14:24:19] <Es0teric> uhhh
[14:24:22] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  I wonder why 21 didnt worked. and why http://jsfiddle.net/px4ke/23/  also workes
[14:24:26] <Es0teric> i think mine is easier to deal with than the guest dude
[14:24:47] <duch_kazatel> yeah i'm giving up on Guest99210 he wants me to write everything fo rhim at this point.
[14:24:48] <duch_kazatel> giving up on that.
[14:24:55] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric what was your question again?
[14:24:58] <duch_kazatel> sorry.
[14:24:58] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: it is not simple for me, what I mean is the concept is simple.  http://www.wadevs.com/Music
[14:25:00] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel ok so i have this http://jsfiddle.net/v9W9Q/4/ i am trying to make the divs slide down or up when the arrow is clicked…. i have jquery easing
[14:25:18] <Guest99210> duch_kazatel,  no no. thanks for the support. I was just clearing up concepts. GREATE HELP
[14:25:20] <Guest99210>  thanks!1
[14:25:26] <lukey> Sorry folks, this is a bit of a n00bish question. I'm developing a jqm site through Dreamweaver but having to duplicate large amounts of code across jquery pages
[14:25:26] <Es0teric> i know that mine can be solved with indexes
[14:25:29] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric did you open your console?
[14:26:04] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel well i dont have that on my project yet..i built it on jsfiddle first to get the concept
[14:26:12] <lukey> I know DW has snippets to save copy pasting but I need something dynamic, kind of like the old C++ #include's
[14:26:25] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric the console in your browser...
[14:26:42] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel yes i opened the console and its saying "top" is undefined
[14:26:49] <Es0teric> yet i have jquery easing referenced
[14:26:53] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric yes $($anchor.attr('href')).offset() isn't correct.
[14:26:53] <decx> in short $anchor.attr('hre) doesnt have an offset
[14:27:01] <duch_kazatel> thank you decx
[14:27:10] <duch_kazatel> you're trying to get the offset of a string.
[14:27:14] <duch_kazatel> not an element
[14:27:39] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel ah ok so how can that be resolved?
[14:28:08] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to get the offset of?  the anchor?
[14:28:42] <dpolivy> luckey: I'm not familiar with DreamWeaver, but sounds like you need to look at a template library (for HTML) or a combined JS file (for shared script)
[14:28:54] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel i guess im trying to get the offset of the element… because that is what will make it scroll
[14:29:03] <dpolivy> lukey: sorry, misspelled your handle above.
[14:29:05] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric right but what element?
[14:29:12] <duch_kazatel> of $anchor?
[14:29:17] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel yes
[14:29:30] <lukey> dpolivy: thank you, I will look into this
[14:29:32] <duch_kazatel> $anchor.offset() ...
[14:29:47] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk could you resend that link?
[14:30:00] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: I sent this twice.  One more time?
[14:30:13] <duch_kazatel> christ this room is moving fast.  miund PMing me?
[14:30:14] <decx> only 3? i need 5 !
[14:30:25] <lukey> dpolivy: because at the moment I have <div data-role="page" id="page2"> and <div data-role="page" id="page2"> with practically identical content!
[14:30:26] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel no no i mean the element of the id on section
[14:30:45] <lukey> dpolivy: sorry the 2nd one should have said #page3
[14:31:00] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel so whenever the arrow is clicked, it should go up one section or down one section
[14:31:48] <dpolivy> lukey: you can use server side or client side, depending on your server technology and what kind of site you're building.
[14:31:52] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric one sec.
[14:32:01] <Es0teric> alright duch_kazatel
[14:32:22] <dpolivy> lukey: I use handlebarsjs.com but there are a ton of options depending on what you want to do and your environment
[14:32:27] <lukey> dpolivy: making a jquery-mobile site destined for an app, on a MSSQL/ASP Server
[14:32:28] <decx> Es0teric that won't happen with scrolltop animation if your .sections are floated with 4000px width
[14:32:38] <decx> you need a different approach
[14:32:49] <Es0teric> decx hmm i see...
[14:32:59] <Es0teric> and i just want to target the wrapper, not the entire html, body
[14:33:06] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric it'll be something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/v9W9Q/5/
[14:33:38] <dpolivy> lukey: classic asp or asp.net? I don't know of any server side templating options for classic asp, sorry.
[14:34:14] <lukey> dpolivy: I think .NET how would I tell?
[14:34:35] <lukey> dpolivy: I am editing someone elses site and had to learn it as I went along
[14:35:01] <dpolivy> lukey: what language is it in? VBScript? C#?
[14:35:13] <dpolivy> lukey: and do the pages end with .asp or .aspx?
[14:35:25] <lukey> dpolivy: .asp not .aspx
[14:36:42] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel i will check it in a minute
[14:37:19] <dpolivy> lukey: sounds like classic asp. if you want server-side generated HTML, then best bet is to use the <!--#INCLUDE --> directives, and build a common asp file which has functions to render out your html. then, you can call those functions from each page as necessary.
[14:38:26] <lukey> dpolivy: Thank you kindly. That will generate the HTML directly - rather than interpret any ASP code therein I guess?
[14:38:26] <dpolivy> lukey: it's not as elegant as a true template language, but it will get the job done and allow you to only write your html once.
[14:38:52] <lukey> I have much duplicated ASP code within the jqm pages
[14:39:28] <dpolivy> lukey: you can do either. it's just another ASP page, so if your included file has <% %> tags, that bit will be interpreted as asp. If it's just html, it will be emitted as-is
[14:40:05] <lukey> dpolivy: That sounds like just what I need. In fact the only real difference in my pages is the name of the database table
[14:40:10] <dpolivy> lukey: if you need to customize things at all, e.g. to add unique IDs, best bet is to use asp to create a sub/function that uses response.write to emit the HTML, substituting in any variables as necessary
[14:40:56] <lukey> dpolivy: Thank you let me try this in next 20 minutes
[14:41:19] <dpolivy> lukey: sure, good luck
[14:44:39] <thebope> I'm trying to set the source of an image with jquery but I'm getting nothing.  updateImage(elementId, src) { document.getElementById(elementId).attr("src", src).show(); doesn't seem to work
[14:44:55] <duch_kazatel> thebope fiddle?
[14:45:01] <thebope>     <img id="pictureUrl" alt="Your picture!" src="" />
[14:45:13] <thebope> yea sure one sec, although I haven't used it much, so two or three secs
[14:49:10] <thebope> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/xSJKT/
[14:49:37] <thebope> The outputs a little funky there but that's the gist of it. I've tried with and without the .show(), with and without the src=""
[14:50:45] <thebope> I placed an alert in the updateImage function to display the src passed in and that works
[14:50:48] <duch_kazatel> let me look
[14:50:55] <thebope> sure, thanks man
[14:51:53] <duch_kazatel> woah.
[14:51:54] <thebope> duch_kazatel, in the fiddle, I forgot to set the id of the img element but it's set
[14:55:09] <duch_kazatel> set it and resend then?
[14:55:47] <thebope> okay
[14:56:07] <duch_kazatel> btw this code won't do any of the stuff you want it do.
[14:56:16] <duch_kazatel> document.getElementById(elementId).attr("src", src).show(); will never work.
[14:56:24] <thebope> http://jsfiddle.net/uLBkg/1/
[14:56:37] <thebope> okay, yea I tried without .show as well
[14:56:40] <duch_kazatel> change it to $(elementId).attr("src", src);
[14:56:43] <thebope> that was an afterthought
[14:56:48] <thebope> ahhh
[14:56:49] <duch_kazatel> you can't call jquery methods on non-jquery objects.
[14:56:51] <thebope> that makes sense
[14:57:22] <thebope> ahh document.getElementById is basic JS
[14:57:30] <thebope> and .attr is jQuery
[14:57:33] <duch_kazatel> it's apart of the DOM API, yeah.
[14:57:37] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[14:57:39] <duch_kazatel> you're getting i.t
[14:57:43] <duch_kazatel> *it
[14:57:43] <thebope> haha :-)
[14:57:47] <thebope> Thanks duch_kazatel
[14:57:52] <duch_kazatel> np
[14:57:58] <duch_kazatel> now for me to do actual work!
[14:58:08] <lukey> dpolivy: I think I got it... http://jsfiddle.net/8Nx6d/
[14:58:43] <xp_prg> how do I name my plnkr, it just says untitled :(
[15:00:15] <dpolivy> lukey: yup, that's the basic approach.
[15:00:27] <lukey> dpolivy: the only thing is I must reinitialise the database before each include
[15:00:43] <dpolivy> lukey: sure, that's up to your design
[15:01:48] <lukey> dpolivy: half the trouble in maintaining someone elses code... I need to reset all the variables that I DIMMED
[15:03:26] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel ok so i saw the code you put… its not triggering the divs to move
[15:03:42] <duch_kazatel> no, it's not.  it's a sample.
[15:03:50] <duch_kazatel> it should give you the basic idea.
[15:03:56] <duch_kazatel> mind linking it back?
[15:04:09] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel yeah sec
[15:04:15] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel -> v
[15:04:16] <Es0teric> http://jsfiddle.net/v9W9Q/5/
[15:06:31] <duch_kazatel> oh the way you included the easings isn't working there for some reason.
[15:06:58] <Es0teric> i dont get why it isnt… it should
[15:07:10] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/v9W9Q/8/
[15:07:14] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel also i just want to target the #wrapper not the entire html, body
[15:07:15] <duch_kazatel> swapped it to jqueryUI instead.
[15:07:34] <duch_kazatel> then target it?
[15:09:38] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel hmmm i just noticed there are several problems… decx pointed out the 4000px issue… and
[15:09:52] <duch_kazatel> yeah you're trying to scroll vertically instead of horizontally...
[15:10:04] <Es0teric> i am not trying to do a horizontal scroll, i am trying to do a vertical one, duch_kazatel
[15:10:21] <duch_kazatel> your content is currently horizontal.
[15:10:22] <duch_kazatel> not vertical.
[15:10:27] <duch_kazatel> so i'd fix that first probably.
[15:23:14] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel
[15:28:24] <lukey> dpolivy: half the trouble in maintaining someone elses code... I need to reset all the variables that I DIMMED
[15:28:34] <lukey> dpolivy: sorry
[15:28:39] <lukey> dpolivy: what I meant to say is
[15:28:43] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric what?
[15:28:49] <lukey> dpolivy: your suggestion worked fantastic
[15:29:11] <lukey> dpolivy: The code is so much more cleaner now and it just works with only one page to edit!
[15:29:13] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel well i still dont get how this vertical scroll would work… i can hide the divs… their height is set to 100%
[15:29:28] <dpolivy> lukey: great!
[15:29:35] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric as of right now, you can't vertically scroll...
[15:29:36] <lukey> dpolivy: That was really bugging me
[15:29:44] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel -> http://jsfiddle.net/v9W9Q/12/show/
[15:29:55] <lukey> Sooner I get this new LAMP server the better!
[15:30:19] <duch_kazatel> dude Es0teric you see why the easing stuff doesn't work, right?
[15:30:31] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel no i do not… i am trying to figure that out lol
[15:30:45] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/uCq06lF.png
[15:30:52] <duch_kazatel> you aren't seeing that error?
[15:31:54] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel i did not see that o.O
[15:35:04] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel alright i linked the CDN of it… http://jsfiddle.net/v9W9Q/13/
[15:36:14] <duch_kazatel> restyle the arrow and it works.
[15:36:35] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/v9W9Q/14/
[15:36:39] <duch_kazatel> put the arrow at the top and it works.
[15:39:44] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel i never knew that putting the arrow at the top made that much of a difference
[15:40:17] <duch_kazatel> how else can you click it to see the effect?
[15:41:38] <Es0teric> well duch_kazatel i thought i could just put it at the bottom and hide everything else… i want to see one div at a time, not all of them at once
[15:55:18] <lethjakman> stupid question...is there a way to match an alert box with jquery?
[15:55:23] <lethjakman> $('alert-box') or something
[16:01:21] <duch_kazatel> i don't know that youy cabn.
[16:01:23] <duch_kazatel> *you can
[16:03:00] <SimbaLion`> could someone help me translate the jquery in this tutorial? http://www.rvamedia.com/wordpress/collapsible-responsive-menu-for-genesis I'm trying to apply this technique to a theme built off the http://html5blank.com template for wordpress
[16:04:02] <lethjakm1> sorry, did anyone answer that?
[16:04:06] <lethjakm1> my internet shut down.
[16:04:23] <lethjakm1> trying to figure out if there's a way to match against alert boxes
[16:08:51] <duch_kazatel> i don't think you can, lethjakm1
[16:09:09] <SimbaLion`> http://jsfiddle.net/UtLq7/ Could someone help me edit the jquery here to match the html example? The jquery is based on some commercial wordpress theme, the html is from a free html5 boilerplate theme.
[16:17:25] <duch_kazatel> SimbaLion` we can't because we don't know what your nah code looks like.
[16:17:29] <duch_kazatel> *nav code
[16:17:41] <SimbaLion`> http://jsfiddle.net/UtLq7/1/ sorry, updated for that
[16:18:08] <Mike11123> good evening jQuery!
[16:18:13] <duch_kazatel> so what do you need?
[16:20:09] <Mike11123> lol, can't just say hi?
[16:20:20] <duch_kazatel> sorry, meant that for someone else.
[16:20:27] <duch_kazatel> SimbaLion` - what do you need help with?
[16:20:35] <SimbaLion`> the jquery does two things, it adds the <div> for the mobile menu to the navigation section, and it causes the menu to collapse or expand when clicked
[16:20:49] <duch_kazatel> it's not adding the div where you think it is.
[16:20:55] <SimbaLion`> but the code is based on some commercial template that I know nothing about, I want to apply it to the rather generic template I'm using as a boilerplate
[16:21:12] <duch_kazatel> first of all - http://jsfiddle.net/UtLq7/4/
[16:21:20] <duch_kazatel> see the minor changes so far?
[16:21:49] <SimbaLion`> Yeah
[16:22:40] <duch_kazatel> now, $("#nav_menu-2").slideToggle(); doesn't do anything because $("#nav_menu-2") doesn't match anything in your code.
[16:23:11] <SimbaLion`> Can I use classes instead of IDs?
[16:23:28] <duch_kazatel> nothing in there has nav_menu-2 anywhere.
[16:23:55] <SimbaLion`> http://jsfiddle.net/UtLq7/6/
[16:24:11] <SimbaLion`> Ah, I think that did it...
[16:24:32] <duch_kazatel> yeah, just need contend in .mobile
[16:25:35] <duch_kazatel> *content
[16:26:06] <SimbaLion`> well it should have a bg image, but it isn't displaying
[16:26:56] <duch_kazatel> mmk.
[16:27:53] <SimbaLion`> looking at the css in chrome tho I dont even see background set so there must be something else going on
[16:29:19] <decx> well the css box is empty so yeah
[16:29:46] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:29:48] <SimbaLion`> oh duh, I know what I did wrong, I put the class as .mobile so the real class was ..mobile heh
[16:29:48] <duch_kazatel> i was abpout to say.
[16:29:53] <decx> the navigation is probably hidden in a media query for lower resolutions
[16:30:15] <SimbaLion`> I think I got it now, it's showing up in devtools, just gotta play with it to get it how I want
[16:30:20] <SimbaLion`> thanks for your help <3
[16:31:46] <Es0teric> ugh i still dont get this
[16:31:47] <Es0teric> =_=
[16:32:00] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric what's your latest?
[16:32:14] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel well i am trying to figure out to get the arrow to move the content up and down
[16:32:28] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric link to a fiddle?
[16:33:06] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel -> http://jsfiddle.net/v9W9Q/17/show/ thats what i have now.. the arrow moves with the first content which is strange
[16:33:35] <duch_kazatel> right, because your css doesn't keep it in place.
[16:33:37] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel even if i put it in position: absolute; still
[16:34:06] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/v9W9Q/18/
[16:34:12] <duch_kazatel> you want position: fixed;
[16:35:19] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel wait why does fixed; work and absolute; doesnt?
[16:35:39] <duch_kazatel> because fixed gives it fixed positioning.
[16:35:51] <tandroid> Hey guys, would it be possible to have floated divs that hold there position with position:absolute; on hover?
[16:35:51] <duch_kazatel> fixed to the window.
[16:36:43] <duch_kazatel> you want position: fixed; tandroid
[16:37:31] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position - read this
[16:38:03] <tandroid> duch_kazatel: no… it's not that
[16:38:17] <tandroid> Sorry it's hard to explain.
[16:38:30] <duch_kazatel> tandroid a fiddle is worth 1000 wods
[16:38:32] <duch_kazatel> *words
[16:38:36] <tandroid> I'm working on it
[16:39:21] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel ahhh ok i see now
[16:41:17] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel -> http://jsfiddle.net/v9W9Q/20/ now would it matter if i just target the #arrow_container as a whole or should i just target each individual arrow?
[16:41:50] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric there are two ways to do this.  which version do you want?
[16:44:05] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/v9W9Q/21/
[16:44:06] <duch_kazatel> check that out
[16:45:28] <Mike11123> evening all... hopefully a quick question, and not too dumb...  preloader gif not displaying.  jsFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/8WdSq/
[16:47:13] <duch_kazatel> Mike11123 lines 20-24 . you see the issue there yeah?
[16:47:21] <tandroid> I'm trying to make the div's stay in the same spot on hover but with position: absolute; so I can add a z-index. http://jsbin.com/AcELeYO/2/edit
[16:47:39] <Es0teric_> duch_kazatel my bad… internet d/c'd
[16:49:02] <Mike11123> duch_kazatel: which lines 20-24? html or js?
[16:49:04] <duch_kazatel> tandroid you can use z-indexing on fixed position elements.
[16:49:08] <duch_kazatel> Mike11123 the JS
[16:49:16] <duch_kazatel> tandroid http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5218927/z-index-not-working-with-fixed-positioning
[16:49:46] <duch_kazatel> Mike11123 you're not binding the way you think you are. go read up about the beforesend and complete ajax callbacks.
[16:50:18] <Es0teric_> duch_kazatel did you get my previous question though?
[16:50:36] <duch_kazatel> which one, Es0teric_ ?
[16:50:44] <Es0teric_> duch_kazatel -> http://jsfiddle.net/v9W9Q/20/ now would it matter if i just target the #arrow_container as a whole or should i just target each individual arrow?
[16:50:48] <Mike11123> will do...
[16:50:53] <duch_kazatel> i don't know what that means.
[16:51:04] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric_ did you look at my code and see what it does?
[16:51:14] <Es0teric_> duch_kazatel which iteration?
[16:51:19] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/v9W9Q/21/,
[16:51:45] <Es0teric_> duch_kazatel ah i see yeah yeah i didnt get that one till now
[16:51:46] <Es0teric_> lol
[16:52:18] <duch_kazatel> actually try this instead: http://jsfiddle.net/v9W9Q/22/
[16:52:35] <duch_kazatel> gets rid of an error when you try to click "up" when on the first slide
[16:53:36] <Es0teric_> duch_kazatel ah i see ok
[16:53:53] <duch_kazatel> and actually you should do another check to see if you're on the last slide but meh
[16:54:11] <Es0teric_> ok duch_kazatel  also i noticed that you have .bind('click', 'div', function(event) {});
[16:54:21] <Es0teric_> why is div a second parameter after click?
[16:54:27] <duch_kazatel> no, .on()
[16:54:29] <duch_kazatel> not bind.
[16:55:12] <duch_kazatel> that's using a technique called event delegation.  $('#arrow_container').on('click', 'div' ,function(event){}); binds an event listener on #arrow_container, listening for events that came from child div elements
[16:55:26] <duch_kazatel> most evens in javascript "bubble" up through the document.
[16:55:31] <Es0teric_> right right
[16:55:45] <duch_kazatel> addding that second selector uses the event delegation setup.
[17:20:26] <jeffshaver> Working on some code if anyone wants to give comments/improvements/etc... https://github.com/jeffshaver/brief.js
[17:20:46] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:21:12] <jeffshaver> ?
[17:21:33] <duch_kazatel> ah, it includes event binding.
[17:21:40] <duch_kazatel> was trying to figure out what made this different from sizzle.
[17:23:57] <jeffshaver> at the moment it does DOM Selection and Event Binding (with support for event delegation). Most of it is in the docs. Just need more sets of eyes for ideas/improvements. I don't want it to be slow. I want it be a small file and I want it to be fast
[17:46:03] <nullbytes> I am trying to create a very large accordion. However, the page lags for a long time when making an accordion with more than a couple hundred sections.
[17:46:34] <duch_kazatel> wait "couple hundred sections" as in a couple hundred accordions?
[17:48:19] <nullbytes> duch_kazatel: no, a couple hundred panels in the accordion
[17:49:19] <_SuperNoob_> hi guys, I would like to know how to do something like this but for all events and functions on a specific element : $('body').off('mousedown', '#elementId', function1)
[17:50:03] <beachandbytes> are you using jquery ui accordian?
[17:51:56] <nullbytes> beachandbytes: yes
[17:55:55] <jimfriendo> Hey pals. Are there any libraries available that ease 'Ajaxifying' a website? Something that may be used as follows: <a href="user/login" data-load-into="#content">Login</a> ?
[17:56:08] <beachandbytes> nullbytes, http://jsfiddle.net/WvtEw/294/
[17:56:10] <beachandbytes> try something like that
[17:57:14] <nullbytes> beachandbytes: thank you!
[17:57:31] <duch_kazatel> jimfriendo check out PJAX
[17:57:48] <duch_kazatel> jimfriendo you'll have to modify your server to get it to work, but that might help.
[18:00:07] <jimfriendo> duch_kazatel: Thanks, that looks good, but isn't quite what I'm looking for. Unfortunately, I need to do this with modal dialogs, with each dialog having a different ID (the container to load into changes... annoying!).
[18:01:12] <beachandbytes> jimfriendo,
[18:01:16] <beachandbytes> could just do something like this http://jsfiddle.net/bBPDJ/
[18:01:16] <duch_kazatel> jimfriendo dunno anything off the top of my head.  you could write your own.
[18:02:53] <jimfriendo> Thanks guys, might write my own along the lines of beachandbytes' example!
[18:14:37] <_SuperNoob_> think it s  : $(document).add('#elementId').off();
[18:14:59] <duch_kazatel> _SuperNoob_ what are you trying to do?  remove an event listener?
[18:15:17] <_SuperNoob_> all on #elementId
[18:15:24] <_SuperNoob_> all events on it
[18:15:27] <duch_kazatel> on that one elementId, you mean?
[18:15:31] <_SuperNoob_> yeah
[18:16:15] <duch_kazatel> call unbind().
[18:16:24] <duch_kazatel> $('#elementId').unbind();
[18:16:52] <duch_kazatel> actually, try $('#elementId').off();
[18:16:56] <duch_kazatel> that should do the same.
[18:17:31] <_SuperNoob_> but I need $(document) before
[18:17:36] <duch_kazatel> why?
[18:18:13] <duch_kazatel> you're all ready looking inside of the document.
[18:18:27] <_SuperNoob_> because I do this before : $(document).on('mousedown', '#elementId', function1)
[18:18:48] <duch_kazatel> you want to remove that event?
[18:18:53] <duch_kazatel> or all events on document?
[18:19:30] <duch_kazatel> because you can do $(document).off('mousedown', '#elementId');
[18:19:31] <_SuperNoob_> all events on #elementId
[18:19:42] <duch_kazatel> all events on document for elementId you mean?
[18:19:43] <beachandbytes> $(document).off("click", "#elementId")
[18:20:02] <_SuperNoob_> nice
[18:20:05] <beachandbytes> removes the click listner on document lisnting for #elementID
[18:20:07] <duch_kazatel> beachandbytes he used mousedown so that's the event you need tp fix.
[18:20:20] <beachandbytes> ya, just showing example
[18:20:24] <duch_kazatel> so use $(document).off('mousedown', '#elementId'); if you bound to mousedown.
[18:20:34] <duch_kazatel> i posted almopost exactly that like 30 seconds before :)
[18:21:40] <cfoch> Hello... How can I write in code this idea? If draggable_object(dragend inside foo_div) { ... } ?
[18:22:07] <_SuperNoob_> so for all events, it s what I say before : $(document).add('#elementId').off();
[18:22:12] <duch_kazatel> no.
[18:23:12] <_SuperNoob_> ( I m on Zepto, but it should be the same)
[18:23:21] <duch_kazatel> you still want .off
[18:23:28] <_SuperNoob_> yeah
[18:23:38] <duch_kazatel> but no .add
[18:24:11] <duch_kazatel> $(document).off();  if you're matching for a given child selector, i'm pretty sure you have to feed the specific events in as well.
[18:24:13] <_SuperNoob_> it s what i see here, at the bottom : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3569393/how-to-unbind-all-event-using-jquery
[18:24:46] <duch_kazatel> do you understand the difference between what that says and what you're asking?
[18:25:12] <_SuperNoob_> it s a bit the same
[18:25:16] <duch_kazatel> it isn't.
[18:25:21] <duch_kazatel> one removes all event hanlders from a page
[18:25:37] <_SuperNoob_> with add(*)
[18:25:44] <duch_kazatel> you want to remove a delegated event handler on document.
[18:25:47] <duch_kazatel> very different
[18:26:44] <duch_kazatel> and with that, i go home.  enjoy.
[18:26:57] <_SuperNoob_> good night
[18:35:11] <_SuperNoob_> with  $('body').off();   it works thx
[19:00:03] <jimfriendo> Is there a closest parent selector in Jquery? e.g. $("child < parent") as opposed to $("parent > child")?
[19:02:13] <shoky> jimfriendo: not a selector but a method. $("child").closest('parent')
[19:02:14] <jimfriendo> ... basically what I'm trying to do is get the closest parent class of an object. So, $(object).parent('modal-dialog'), but using a selector and not the .parent
[19:02:33] <shoky> `api closest
[19:02:34] <b-ot> shoky: .closest(): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[19:03:02] <jimfriendo> shoky: ah damn... no way to get it via a text selector?
[19:03:32] <shoky> no, but you just said you don't need it, as you already have some $(object)
[19:03:41] <shoky> so..  $(object).closest('.modal-dialog')
[19:04:15] <jimfriendo> shoky: sorry, I didn't actually have it like that, was just demonstrating what I was after, but wanted the selector equivalent (if one existed).
[19:04:46] <jimfriendo> shoky: Thanks anyway though, appreciate your help!
[19:06:00] <shoky> why dya need a selector
[19:08:25] <jimfriendo> shoky: I'm building an Ajaxifying Library thing. It's usage is like this: <a href="auth/login" data-container=".modal-dialog">Login</a>. Basically, wanted the flexibility of being able to specify in data-container that I wanted it to go into the parent modal-dialog as opposed to all of that kind. I know I might be able to hack this into the function itself by doing "closest", just thought it might be neater and more
[19:08:27] <jimfriendo> flexible doing it with a selector.
[19:08:47] <cfoch> Why I get event.dataTransfer as undefined?
[19:10:08] <shoky> jimfriendo gotcha. but you'll get all the flexibility you need by just treating it as "the selector that's supplied to .closest"
[19:10:56] <Vivekananda> Hello everyone. I have a jquery bind function ( will paste in a bit). I have a few questions 1. Can I associate a bind to a class of elements not just the element itself.  Just wanting to confirm though it works.  2. My jquery shows a dropdown with search ahead. I want that search ahead to work as links ( currently just simple text) and also on clicking , select part of the data as selected so basically I want to learn more of d
[19:10:56] <Vivekananda> esigning read ahead search boxes. any tutorials for it ?
[19:10:58] <shoky> well, not ALL the flexibility you might want.. but still, not bad
[19:11:01] <jimfriendo> shoky: You mean as in: $(this).closest(container).html(data)?
[19:11:57] <shoky> jimfriendo yea, tho i suppose you might want a different data-xx attribute for the 'closest' case
[19:12:08] <shoky> adunno
[19:13:32] <jimfriendo> shoky: hhhhmmm... for the scope of what I'm doing, I think the $(this).closest(container).html(data) might work okay. Might add a data-container'S' for those where it's hitting not just the closest. Thanks for your help man!
[19:23:06] <Mapper99> Anyone know if there is a jquery function to convert a PHP json variable to a JavaScript variable?
[19:28:18] <Vivekananda> any clues for me
[20:01:14] <Gmac_> hello. I'm using replaceWith but i want to grab the contents before that and put them back in
[20:01:20] <Gmac_> so i used contents()
[20:01:30] <Gmac_> when i try to append it back in there is nothing
[20:17:54] <Vivekananda> In case anyone is here I am receiving an array filled in by two sql queries as response to a jquery .get request. now I want to display these results in different colors and also some functionality. Where can I find tutorials for this ?
[20:33:46] <jphase> Vivekananda: I would recommend json encoding your response from the server and using something like .done(function(data){ var data = $.parseJSON(data); // put your .each here });
[20:34:38] <jphase> json_encode() in php for example will prepare the response from sql in json, then you can pull the data and parse it as json within your ajax response and loop through the results with .each
[20:48:28] <Vivekananda> jphase: the php code is getting the info fine and is creating a array. the array is then sent as a response to the jquery and it then displays it. I want to make some changes to the array eg color and stuff so that before displaying it changes. where do I make these changes ? I amguessing I have to do it in the response function. the code is here ---  https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/8702800  in line 7
[20:51:32] <morfin> hmm
[20:52:16] <jphase> Vivekananda: you can build jquery elements based on your response, i.e. $('<div>').css({color: 'pink'}).text(data.somevalue).appendTo(someelement);
[20:54:03] <jphase> and yes, within the response function is where you'd do that
[20:55:36] <MapsRus> Anyone used the AutoComplete jquery function?
[20:56:08] <jphase> MapsRus: jquery ui autocomplete you mean? yes.
[20:56:49] <MapsRus> sorry..yes...
[20:57:08] <MapsRus> I can't get it to work using my JSON...
[21:01:34] <MapsRus> Here is the JSON I am using  http://pastebin.com/MGKUTXZQ
[21:02:19] <MapsRus> Is there a problem with the formats?  In Fiddler, I show this request failing :  "NetworkError: 400 Bad Request - http://localhost/autocomplete/%5B%7B%22name%22:%22Adm...
[21:03:30] <jphase> MapsRus: it's less about the json data and more about how you're handling it in the source: function
[21:06:32] <MapsRus> I'm using it like this:  $( "#autocomplete" ).autocomplete({   source: books }); where books = json string
[21:09:27] <jphase> MapsRus: you'll need something more extensive than that. If you already have the json data at place where you call the .autocomplete function then you'll need to do something like source: function(){ $.each(data, function(index, value){ return {label: jsondata.name, value: jsondata.value} }); }
[21:10:07] <jphase> look at this: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp  and if you already have the json data available then just focus on lines 36-39
[21:10:45] <jphase> otherwise you can do the ajax request similar to how they're doing that (minus using jsonp unless that's your flavor) and use lines 24-55ish
[21:12:45] <jphase> another alternative would be to change the response from the server to have label: 'something', value: 'somevalue'
[21:12:47] <Vivekananda> jphase: if I want to make an entry so that it is clickable then how to do this and such stuff in the response function. What user tutorial/guide do I read for this ?
[21:13:31] <jphase> Vivekananda: so in your response when you build the object, like $('<div>').on('click', function(){ // do something }).appendTo(yaddayadda);
[21:13:51] <MapsRus> So, I can't just "bind" the control to a JSON variable.  I need to loop through and pull the values out?
[21:13:55] <jphase> (binding events on the fly is fun and good :)
[21:15:22] <jphase> MapsRus: you can actually, but the json response will need to be prepared for autocomplete
[21:16:12] <jphase> MapsRus: a better example is actually this:  http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote   open up your network tab, and click on "Response" and you'll see how the json data needs to be formed to pass just the data object
[21:17:30] <Vivekananda> jphase: I got it isnt there a place I can read more details about this
[21:21:09] <jphase> Vivekananda: there might be a tutorial to do exactly what you need but it'd take longer to find it than to tell you
[21:21:18] <jphase> want me to just show you?
[21:21:41] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=cex447FANk
[21:23:13] <jphase> Vivekananda: click that link ^
[21:26:37] <jphase> k, nvm
[21:28:37] <MapsRus> >>jphase - here is the code I am trying to get to work:  http://jsfiddle.net/p5AFc/1/
[21:36:02] <MapsRus> >jphase Update code:  http://jsfiddle.net/p5AFc/6/
[21:36:26] <jphase> MapsRus: it looks like your json response only has a name key in there, can you just turn this into an array instead?
[21:37:05] <jphase> also, your array of objects doesn't need "" around it
[21:37:20] <MapsRus> jphase:  yes, I could.  It is coming from PHP right now.
[21:37:49] <jphase> yeah, just make it an array
[21:37:52] <jphase> then it'll be easy
[21:38:46] <jphase> i.e. http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/p5AFc/7/
[21:49:39] <MapsRus> Thanks jphase...that code looks great!  I just need to clean up my array from php - here are the contents:   { [0]=> array(1) { ["name"]=> string(13) "Administrator" } [1]=> array(1) { ["name"]=> string(8) "Bob Test" }
[22:02:32] <jphase> MapsRus: sure thing
