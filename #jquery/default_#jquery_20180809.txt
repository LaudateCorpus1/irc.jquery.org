[01:36:24] <Ownage> Hello, having a hard time trying to deal with waiting for the background image to load completely and display, before showing the rest of the page. I'm currently trying to use this plugin jquery.waitforimages.min.js
[01:37:31] <Ownage> a snippit is http://jsfiddle.net/z2Lxpfsk/
[01:38:01] <Ownage> Basically my issue now is, this function does run when things are loaded, but I can't remove the 'js-loading' class from <body>
[01:38:29] <Ownage> when I try to alert various ways I've seen to get the classes of an item, nothing seems to be working
[02:42:10] <Lenswipee> hi, having trouble googling answer to using console.log() to log the current HTML position in the DOM tree. Help thanks
[02:52:27] <Woet> Lenswipee: what is the problem?
[02:53:12] <Lenswipee> Woet: hi, having trouble googling answer to using console.log() to log the current HTML position in the DOM tree. Help thanks
[02:53:19] <Woet> Lenswipee: that is not a problem.
[02:53:31] <Woet> Lenswipee: please share your test case on www.jsfiddle.net, explain the expected result and the actual result.
[02:53:45] <Lenswipee> Woet: why is it not a problem?
[02:54:15] <Woet> Lenswipee: you're just saying you're having trouble.
[02:54:44] <Lenswipee> Woet: Then you must have a reading problem.
[02:54:49] <Woet> Lenswipee: ok, good luck.
[02:55:33] <Lenswipee> Woet: smh
[03:15:09] <Lenswipee> how to alert the correct textarea text as it currents does all? https://jsfiddle.net/n5z9L3tw/8/
[03:20:18] <Woet> Lenswipee: $('textarea') refers to every textarea. inside your click event, use "this" to refer to the actual one that has been clicked.
[03:20:35] <wtfjtzm> change it to   alert( $(this).text() );
[03:23:06] <Lenswipee> how to do it without using $(this) in case it was in a different event?
[03:26:55] <wtfjtzm> you can pass event argument to the function and call it like this https://jsfiddle.net/86ajuxpd/
[03:37:26] <sharax> hi friends

[03:43:32] <sharax> indexOf problem
[03:43:35] <sharax> please check
[04:07:53] <Lenswipee> wtfjtzm: yes but what if it's a different event? like a keypress event that triggers a click event for the textarea problem?
[04:15:06] <Lenswipee> see https://jsfiddle.net/86ajuxpd/10/
[04:22:57] <AdamPDotty> that fiddle does not do a lot as to be expected

[08:08:52] <madprops> morning
[08:09:43] <madprops> im wondering, how would you insert the "onclick" into that bit programatically instead of as an inline string, since I'm trying to not have inline onclick declarations .. https://paste.ee/p/cR2LO
[08:09:57] <madprops> that's basically a function that replaces urls in text with the appropiate <a> element
[08:10:29] <madprops> im not sure how to turn those into a jquery object, add the .click event, and insert them correctly
[08:33:14] <madprops> nvm found a way: https://paste.ee/p/QB293
[09:31:10] <dziadekludojadek> hi guys I've got some silly issue "Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined" but file loads properly
[09:32:02] <dziadekludojadek> I'm trying jquery-3.2.1.min.js
[09:33:25] <Duikb00t> You load maybe $ jquery AFTER your application where you use it.
[09:35:18] <dziadekludojadek> Duikb00t: I figured it exactly seconds before : ]
[09:35:41] <dziadekludojadek> thank you :)
[10:20:22] <RandomSerb> mind someone please check http://www.ansonika.com/findoctor/detail-page-3.html , scroll down to SELECT VISIT - TREATMENT , and tell me how do those checkboxes work  if I change ID attribute on checkbox, it doesn't work
[10:21:25] <EugenA> how can I get an input:visible field by name ?
[10:41:28] <AdamPDotty> document.getElementsByName()
[10:43:20] <AdamPDotty> RandomSerb: did you check the id in the label, too?
[10:43:51] <RandomSerb> oh, I didn't, good idea
[10:43:52] <RandomSerb> let me check
[10:45:09] <RandomSerb> yeah, that was the problem. thanks!
[12:00:39] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/579922/  why i am unable to remove check value?
[12:01:11] <taplar> invalid selector
[12:01:57] <taplar> should be #answer for the id
[12:02:46] <Rockwood> taplar, still the same
[12:02:47] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/579927/
[12:03:02] <taplar> syntax error now
[12:03:08] <taplar> open your console
[12:04:24] <Rockwood> http://dpaste.com/3ZHFD5B  no error showing here
[12:05:14] <taplar> if you open your console and click the element to make that action happen you will see the error.  I mean, just look at what you are doing
[12:05:45] <taplar> console$('#answer').removeAttr('checked');
[12:06:25] <taplar> you fixed the id selector, but you introduced other stuff
[12:06:34] <Rockwood> but my code looks like now console.log($('#answer').removeAttr('checked'));
[12:06:49] <taplar> k, that's valid.
[12:07:12] <Rockwood> but still the error
[12:07:31] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/9Lqefc73/
[12:07:44] <Rockwood> not un selecting it
[12:08:34] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/9Lqefc73/1/
[12:09:07] <taplar> the issue is that you are trying to remove the attribute, which isn't there.  Once the html is parsed into the dom, the properties change, not the attributes (typically).
[12:09:19] <taplar> So if you want to uncheck the radio, you need to change it's checked property.
[12:09:39] <Rockwood> okay
[12:10:10] <Rockwood> wow thanks
[12:10:42] <taplar> you can think if the html and dom like a template and a result of the template.  When you have both, changing the template doesn't directly change the result you already created from it.  you have to change the result at that point, :)
[12:10:52] <taplar> "think if" => "think of"
[12:11:17] <Rockwood> actually i am using php
[12:11:34] <taplar> you are generating markup with php, but your browser only works with the html and js
[12:11:36] <Rockwood> and i am making a quiz web appliation
[12:11:37] <taplar> it doesn't know anythinga bout php
[12:11:53] <taplar> php is a server side language
[12:12:08] <Rockwood> i want saved event by jquery ajax
[12:12:41] <taplar> i'm not sure i understand that last statement
[12:13:45] <taplar> brb
[12:14:02] <Rockwood> taplar, suppose if a candidate saved wrong answer in between the quiz and after few mints remove wrong answer then
[12:19:45] <taplar_lunch> "in between the quiz" ?
[12:21:00] <Rockwood> quiz web app
[12:21:16] <Rockwood> a session of quiz
[12:21:51] <taplar_lunch> so a person starts a quiz.  saves a wrong answer.  .....something....   user removes wrong answer
[12:22:06] <taplar_lunch> i'm not understanding what question you are asking
[12:26:28] <Rockwood> taplar_lunch, you answered (solved my issue) already so please eat your lunch with relax :)

[12:37:51] <robertBusy> wat
[12:38:04] <Rockwood> i dont know why he like to ask wrong question
[12:38:17] <Rockwood> questions always every where
[12:39:03] <taplar_lunch> not everyone knows the right question to ask
[12:39:11] <taplar_lunch> in general
[12:39:15] <robertBusy> also please don't talk smack like that in here.
[12:39:19] <AdamPDotty> Do not feed the trolls!
[12:39:42] <AdamPDotty> the right question is usually the solution
[12:39:48] <Rockwood> by mistake i feed him
[12:40:07] <AdamPDotty> And that sir is the right question.
[12:40:46] <AdamPDotty> anyways, I'd better get home now
[12:41:20] <Rockwood> AdamPDotty, office allow to IRC?
[12:41:26] <AdamPDotty> yep
[12:41:36] <Rockwood> really?
[12:41:39] <Rockwood> very nice
[12:41:54] * AdamPDotty books under miscellaneous :-)
[12:42:04] <AdamPDotty> nearly got it I feel
[12:42:08] <robertBusy> that's pretty common Rockwood
[12:42:17] <Rockwood> ah okay
[12:42:21] <AdamPDotty> It usually goes both ways.
[12:42:30] <AdamPDotty> You help and get help, when needed.
[12:42:35] <robertBusy> ^
[12:42:40] <Rockwood> are you only in PHP?
[12:42:42] <taplar_lunch> my place actually blocks the irc port, but doesn't block irc web apps
[12:42:58] <robertBusy> hah
[12:42:58] <AdamPDotty> I miss mIRC :-)
[12:43:16] <Rockwood> mIRC is dead now?
[12:43:27] <robertBusy> i'm using mIRC right now.
[12:43:29] <robertBusy> (shrug)
[12:43:36] <Rockwood> nice
[12:43:43] <AdamPDotty> I would not know how to get in running on a mac.
[12:43:58] <Rockwood> i think you have to buy
[12:44:04] <AdamPDotty> tried that
[12:44:05] <robertBusy> it's windows only.
[12:44:15] <Rockwood> AdamPDotty, are you only PHP programmer
[12:44:18] <taplar_lunch> doesn't mac have a windows emulator?  bootcamp, or something.... i forget
[12:44:25] <robertBusy> https://www.mirc.com/mac.html
[12:44:39] <robertBusy> bootcamp lets you load windows on a mac.
[12:45:05] <taplar_lunch> ah, so it's not a small thing like wine
[12:45:24] <AdamPDotty> In my last job I used it with wine on linux.
[12:45:25] <robertBusy> yeah - it's full windows.  like, you boot into OSX or Windows.
[12:45:31] <Rockwood> please dont say word wine
[12:45:39] <taplar_lunch> ?
[12:45:44] <robertBusy> wut
[12:45:44] <Rockwood> otherwise i will be mad
[12:45:52] <Rockwood> i like whisky lol
[12:45:57] <robertBusy> uh
[12:45:59] <robertBusy> 'k
[12:46:07] * AdamPDotty looks at wine.
[12:46:15] <AdamPDotty> Hmm, was Tuesday a good year?
[12:46:24] <robertBusy> huh?
[12:46:27] <Rockwood> right now i just finished my one
[12:46:41] <AdamPDotty> hehe, so you do not get _all_ references.
[12:46:45] * AdamPDotty is old.
[12:47:02] <robertBusy> ???
[12:47:18] * AdamPDotty born to consufe.
[12:47:26] * Rockwood is looking for another bottle  
[12:48:10] <Rockwood> AdamPDotty, do you like whisky or beers?
[12:48:32] <AdamPDotty> Tullamore Dew cause strangers are friends we do not know yet.
[12:49:08] <Rockwood> glasses never strangers :)
[12:49:47] <Rockwood> cheers friend
[12:50:15] <Rockwood> its night here and i just back to home and relaxing
[12:51:48] <Rockwood> taplar, very quick in finish lunch
[12:52:26] <taplar> yeah, today has been "interesting", so i feel like i need to get back to the grind sooner than later
[12:53:13] <Rockwood> taplar, are you online front end developer?
[12:53:21] <Rockwood> only === online
[12:54:07] <taplar> i'm a quasi-full stack developer
[12:54:17] <taplar> i have to deal with all the parts
[12:54:23] <Rockwood> like?
[12:54:26] <Rockwood> node?
[12:54:32] <Rockwood> nodejs?
[12:54:50] <taplar> mainly java languages backend, and html/css/js/jQuery/angular frontend
[12:55:05] <Rockwood> ah okay java
[12:55:24] <oojacoboo> java has more than one lang?
[12:55:34] <taplar> yeah, groovy is a java based language
[12:55:38] <taplar> runs on the jvm
[12:55:45] <Rockwood> oojacoboo, welcome in talk
[12:55:48] <oojacoboo> You mean languages that use the JVM
[12:56:04] <Rockwood> JVM stands for?
[12:56:09] <robertBusy> java virtual machine
[12:56:15] <taplar> sure.  "java language" was just the first thing that came to mind
[12:56:24] <robertBusy> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine Rockwood
[12:56:38] <robertBusy> big part of how java is cross-platform.
[12:56:58] <Rockwood> Java is hard comparatively PHP?
[12:57:08] <taplar> "hard"?
[12:57:09] <robertBusy> different.
[12:57:15] <Rockwood> i know PHP is scripted
[12:57:18] <robertBusy> lol
[12:57:25] <robertBusy> you mean "a scripting language"?
[12:57:29] <Rockwood> yes
[12:57:41] <Rockwood> by mistake forget last word just
[12:57:50] <Rockwood> to type
[12:57:54] <taplar> you can write scripts with java, but it forces more of an object pattern
[12:58:08] <robertBusy> modern php is much more OO than the past.
[12:58:32] <taplar> i relate java more to C++
[12:58:33] <Rockwood> robertBusy, do you aware with PHP?
[12:58:55] <Rockwood> Java is faster or PHP?
[12:59:02] <robertBusy> not much, no, but I know a lot of people who use it.
[12:59:09] <robertBusy> and that's a loaded question ;)
[12:59:17] <taplar> yeah, they're both interpreted
[12:59:46] <robertBusy> depends on the use case, as well.
[12:59:47] <taplar> though java is compiled to it's byte codes
[12:59:58] <Rockwood> why JavaScript have java at start?
[13:00:08] <robertBusy> just the name.
[13:00:12] <taplar> cause the guy who made it wanted it to be popular
[13:00:15] <robertBusy> javascript and java have nothing to do with each other.
[13:00:17] <Rockwood> with no reason
[13:00:18] <taplar> and java was popular at the time
[13:00:20] <robertBusy> php can be (and often is) compiled fwiw.
[13:00:29] <taplar> (or so i've read)
[13:01:10] <Rockwood> taplar, have you tried anything in PHP?
[13:01:18] <Rockwood> anytime?
[13:01:20] <taplar> sure, i've coded php recreationally
[13:01:33] <Rockwood> really
[13:01:38] <taplar> sure
[13:01:51] <Rockwood> still its alive?
[13:01:58] <taplar> the language?
[13:02:38] <Rockwood> coded work
[13:02:44] <robertBusy> wut
[13:03:05] <Rockwood> taplar> sure, i've coded php recreationally
[13:03:20] <taplar> are you asking if anything i've written is still being used?
[13:03:28] <Rockwood> yes
[13:03:43] <taplar> i believe so, though i've re-written most of it
[13:04:28] <taplar> http://hiddenworld.taplar.com/prod/  uses php for the endpoints
[13:05:11] <taplar> https://github.com/taplar/site-editor was a site editor i used to use a lot that was written in php
[13:05:42] <taplar> just random stuff
[13:07:45] <Rockwood> ah nice
[13:07:55] <Rockwood> you are nice person
[13:08:07] <taplar> lies!
[13:08:29] <Rockwood> thanks for nice communication
[13:08:39] <taplar> np man
[13:09:07] <Rockwood> you have helped me and nicely talking with stranger :)
[13:09:31] <taplar> that's what we're here for, ^_^
[13:09:39] <Rockwood> :)
[13:12:32] <Rockwood> taplar, what could be best way for learn java?
[13:13:25] <Rockwood> any book or by any tutorial
[13:13:28] <taplar> Just trying it out, I would say.  I'm assuming there are some tutorials around
[13:14:06] <Rockwood> any good which is do you like to ref
[13:14:56] <taplar> I don't really reference tutorials currently.  I more often have specific questions about something that I want to do and just google for that particular thing
[13:16:26] <Rockwood> taplar, thanks
[13:17:00] <taplar> If you have access to any O'Reily books, they are usually good ones
[13:17:13] <taplar> imho
[13:18:56] <pavonia> Best way really is learning by doing. Start with a simple hello-world-program and extend it until you have a fully-fledged GUI/console/server/whatever application
[13:19:19] <taplar> But other than that, find a tutorial that covers the basics, get familiar with them.  Then if you have specific questions on stuff you want to do, google for it, or look on Stack Overflow, or hit up the java room on freenode.  @Rockwood
[13:20:01] <Rockwood> sure taplar
[13:20:29] <pavonia> Also looking at other code helps me a lot learning a new language
[13:20:57] <taplar> yeah, examples can be super helpful
[13:33:28] <Rockwood> i think more better approach for un check
[13:33:31] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/Lwkqg5hr/1/
[13:34:38] <taplar> Take off the checked attribute from the markup and see if it still works
[13:35:19] <MassDebates> Hi.
[13:35:23] <MassDebates> A radio button shouldn't be unchecked.
[13:35:40] <MassDebates> The only reason you should be doing this is for specialized displays that select 1 of multiple pieces of content.
[13:36:05] <taplar> There can be user cases where you want to allow a user to remove their selection
[13:36:35] <taplar> Rather than providing a third 'no comment' option
[13:37:01] <MassDebates> Then a radio button is inappropriate.
[13:37:14] <taplar> That's a matter of opinion
[13:37:19] <MassDebates> No, it's a matter of specified usage.
[13:37:22] <MassDebates> In the spec.
[13:37:27] <taplar> nope
[13:37:32] <MassDebates> A set of radio buttons shouldn't start unselected. the indeterminate value is invalid.
[13:38:01] <taplar> If you want a user to be able to say yes/no, or not answer, you cannot do that with a checkbox
[13:38:09] <MassDebates> A checkbox is also invalid.
[13:38:10] <taplar> allowing them to not select one, allows for that use case
[13:38:37] <MassDebates> <select> is more appropriate if you want users to be able to select only one of many, or none at all by leaving it at the indeterminate selection.
[13:38:50] <MassDebates> That is why <select> exists.
[13:39:02] <taplar> that's just another way of providing the third option as a selection.
[13:39:08] <taplar> same as offering a third radio button
[13:39:16] <MassDebates> Radio buttons are meant for non-negotiable, aka required choices.
[13:39:22] <MassDebates> Where one choice must be made.
[13:39:28] <taplar> Again, it's a matter of opinion and UI/UX design choices
[13:39:52] <Rockwood> taplar, not working my case now  https://jsfiddle.net/sbop8qth/
[13:41:02] <MassDebates> "Indeed, in general, authors are encouraged to avoid having radio button groups that do not have any initially checked controls in the first place, as this is a state that the user cannot return to, and is therefore generally considered a poor user interface."
[13:41:10] <MassDebates> https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html
[13:41:24] <taplar> "in general"
[13:41:34] <taplar> it's not an absolute
[13:42:10] <MassDebates> Yes, 'in general' refers to generalized usage. Something that would be considered non-generalized usage would be something like an accordion display.
[13:42:23] <Rockwood> taplar, have seen where is the issue no?
[13:42:25] <MassDebates> Forms and choices, however, are well within the domain of generalized usage.
[13:42:26] <Rockwood> now
[13:42:28] <taplar> @Rockwood for some reason your fiddle is taking a while to load for me
[13:42:29] <MassDebates> <select> is appropriate.
[13:42:45] <taplar> MassDebates: if you are looking to change my mind here, then you are having a pointless discussion
[13:43:13] <MassDebates> If your mind was the only one that mattered in this discussion, I'd have proposed PM.
[13:43:30] <MassDebates> But there are other eyes in this channel. I wanted to correct the misinformation. I rarely see it in here.
[13:43:48] <taplar> Again, not misinformation. As the docs you linked stated.
[13:44:40] <Rockwood> taplar, its loaded?
[13:45:13] <taplar> this is weird. let me bounce my vpn
[13:45:29] <Rockwood> means?
[13:46:23] <MassDebates> Rockwood, he'll be able to review your fiddle in a few moments
[13:46:39] <MassDebates> Give him time. He's really good at jquery
[13:46:56] <taplar2> there we go
[13:47:13] <MassDebates> taplar2, in case if you don't have the url anymore https://jsfiddle.net/sbop8qth/
[13:47:32] <taplar> yeah i had to refresh it. i dunno why my network does that some times
[13:47:46] <MassDebates> I like mullvad
[13:48:07] <taplar> Rockwood: so you see that it's not working now.  remember what I said when you first asked about this, and I changed it to use prop() rather than using the removeAttr
[13:48:46] <taplar> MassDebates: i'm stuck with cisco with work.  haven't had much experience with vpn outside of word
[13:48:49] <taplar> *work
[13:49:32] <MassDebates> Rockwood,  http://api.jquery.com/prop/ i think this may help
[13:52:29] <Rockwood> taplar, something wrong goes with my checked issue
[13:52:48] <taplar> well you have a couple things going on with that fiddle
[13:53:21] <MassDebates> I think I'll give this one a shot.
[13:53:22] <taplar> first off, you have multiple elements that match that class, so trying to do $(selector).attr('checked') for multiple elements doesn't make sense
[13:53:35] <MassDebates> I'm going to try to use prop
[13:53:55] <taplar> yeah, you have to use prop, but you also need to do a loop here
[13:53:59] <Rockwood> taplar, its my requirement
[13:54:06] <taplar> what is your requirement?
[13:54:24] <Rockwood> MassDebates, even prop also not effecting there
[13:55:00] <Rockwood> i have 5 radio inputs okay
[13:56:00] <taplar> sure
[13:56:06] <Rockwood> just user click on reset it should be removes if any chked
[13:56:11] <taplar> sure
[13:56:17] <taplar> "if any"
[13:56:23] <taplar> that's not what your if is currently doing
[13:56:43] <MassDebates> https://jsfiddle.net/kp3qrx4c/
[13:56:47] <MassDebates> This is my failed attempt! lol
[13:56:53] <MassDebates> I followed what Rockwood said
[13:57:00] <MassDebates> but I think this needs to check each individual radio button
[13:57:06] <MassDebates> taplar is right on the loop
[13:57:25] <MassDebates> I'm not sure why the last one gets checked from this code. taplar do you know why?
[13:57:45] <taplar> the if will always be true as prop() as a setter returns a jQuery object
[13:57:58] <MassDebates> uhhhhh
[13:58:04] <taplar> but, yeah that's weird
[13:58:10] <MassDebates> idk what that means tbh
[13:58:15] <taplar> oh!
[13:58:31] <MassDebates> What's setter?
[13:58:31] <taplar> because of the $(this)
[13:58:39] <taplar> prop(key, value) is the setter version of prop
[13:58:47] <taplar> it returns a jQuery object, which is always truthy
[13:58:48] <MassDebates> this goes to the subject in question on the if() ?
[13:58:54] <taplar> while prop(key) returns the value of the property
[13:59:01] <MassDebates> Wait
[13:59:01] <taplar> yeah
[13:59:12] <MassDebates> I can't test to see if it's one or the other specifically?
[13:59:19] <MassDebates> not like this I mean
[13:59:21] <MassDebates> right?
[13:59:44] <taplar> we can test in a filter and find the ones that are checked.  or we could do an each and the 'this' in the each would be each radio
[13:59:52] <taplar> but really, we don't need any of that
[14:00:00] <MassDebates> Becuase we know we want to clear all of them
[14:00:02] <taplar> we can just do $(selector).prop('checked', false)
[14:00:02] <MassDebates> So why the if?
[14:00:19] <taplar> it's not like unchecking things that are unchecked already is going to hurt
[14:00:24] <MassDebates> Right
[14:00:28] <MassDebates> Cause theres only ever one at most
[14:00:45] <MassDebates> (Though I disagree with unchecking radio buttons when they're used for form purposes)
[14:00:46] <taplar> heh, so yeah, actually you could use the :checked selector
[14:01:41] <taplar> Going back to that, I agree that radios should have a default selection in general.  I was just taking reproach to the idea that it should "always" be like that.  That was my primary argument.
[14:01:51] <Rockwood> MassDebates, are you on any conclusion?
[14:02:06] <MassDebates> I've no idea what your conclusion is
[14:02:15] <MassDebates> I was just interested in this fiddle here for my own curiosity.
[14:02:20] <MassDebates> I like to learn
[14:02:25] <taplar> Rockwood: did you see what mass and I were talking about?
[14:02:30] <MassDebates> lol
[14:02:50] <Rockwood> <taplar> we can just do $(selector).prop('checked', false)
[14:03:49] <Rockwood> taplar, still confusion for me
[14:03:58] <taplar> which part?
[14:04:23] <jak2000> hi friends
[14:04:51] <jak2000> how to check if a input text id xCant have only numbers (not decimal, only integer numbers)....
[14:05:10] <Rockwood> taplar, why its going on last input as a chaked
[14:05:33] <taplar> because it's setting the checked on each element
[14:05:43] <taplar> but only a single radio can be checked
[14:06:05] <taplar> the internal command, since it is using 'this', is trying to remove the checked from the element that was clicked, not any radio
[14:06:32] <Rockwood> k ty
[14:06:50] <Rockwood> i sleeping time tmro i will correct it
[14:07:00] <taplar> we can do that really quick.
[14:07:06] <taplar> we already said how to do it, heh
[14:07:06] <Rockwood> thank taplar and MassDebates
[14:07:23] <Rockwood> loop?
[14:07:37] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/kp3qrx4c/4/  that's all you need
[14:07:49] <MassDebates> For the record
[14:07:59] <MassDebates> He chose MY fiddle to fork from, Rockwood
[14:08:04] <MassDebates> Don't forget that.
[14:08:15] <taplar> lol, wut?
[14:08:27] <Rockwood> thanks both are you
[14:08:32] * MassDebates didn't do anything 
[14:08:57] <Rockwood> taplar, ty very much good night
[14:09:06] <taplar> take care
[14:09:12] * Rockwood is sleeping 
[14:09:15] <MassDebates> taplar, I was just bragging that you updated from my fiddle, not his.
[14:09:18] <MassDebates> :P
[14:09:22] <Rockwood> taplar, ty have a nice one
[14:09:33] <Rockwood> MassDebates, thanks a lot
[14:09:37] <taplar> :D if anything i'm a lazy programmer
[14:09:40] <MassDebates> Rockwood, No problem
[14:09:52] <MassDebates> Rockwood, I really don't deserve thanks. i didn't figure anything out.
[14:11:33] <taplar> now back to making my webpage talk to me
