[00:02:09] <donCams> burn!
[00:02:13] <donCams> Eviltwin ftw!
[00:03:10] <donCams> Eviltwin, you're always kinda stingy but I appreciate your help so I don't mind :) you earned your right to be stingy. heh
[00:03:31] <Eviltwin> I try to encourage good long-term practices
[00:03:45] <Eviltwin> One of the most important of which is the ability to help yourself given a good manual
[00:03:50] <Eviltwin> And jQuery has a damn good manual
[00:03:52] <donCams> and I get that... don't be too harsh on the newcomers though. :)
[00:04:20] <donCams> one reason why i love jQuery
[00:20:12] <paul_irish> Eviltwin: i like your style.
[00:28:34] <Whirl3d> so, I have an ugly RegExp validation pattern that I want to be able to store in the markup using the data- attribute prefix, what is the best way to ensure that the special characters are escaped correctly? Anbody have a good link, or should I just wing it on Google?
[00:29:49] <paul_irish> you know in html5 forms
[00:29:54] <paul_irish> the pattern attribute is for this
[00:30:11] <paul_irish> but
[00:30:55] <paul_irish> http://mothereff.in/unquoted-attributes will provide some ideas
[00:31:01] <Whirl3d> Just exploring html5 forms. do you know if modernizr will fix pre-html5 forms?
[00:31:05] <Whirl3d> thanks for the reply, btw
[00:31:10] <paul_irish> ", ', `, =, <, or >.   are your troublemaker characters
[00:31:25] <paul_irish> no modernizr only detects what the browser has
[00:31:33] <paul_irish> but you can use h5f or webshims to do it
[00:31:37] <paul_irish> html5please.us tells you more
[00:32:36] <Whirl3d> great! That's just what I have been looking for. Thanks again.

[00:40:43] <synchrone> hi everyone
[00:40:52] <Whirl3d> hi synchrone
[00:41:38] <synchrone> is there a way i can make a jquery plugin which would act like a static class. I don't need it to operate on some elements, but instead, have some uniform way to execute the code
[00:41:41] <synchrone> ?
[00:42:25] <synchrone> jquery boilerplate seem to imply i'm gonna use $('#element_id').plugin() style
[00:44:47] <Eviltwin> paul_irish: Thanks, man
[00:44:54] <Eviltwin> paul_irish: I like my style too :D

[01:18:45] <mdupont> hi
[01:35:26] <Whirl3d> hi  mdupont
[01:35:48] <mdupont> just learning jquery for some months
[01:38:00] <DofLeFou> any easy to validate .. if user input text of type js is valid
[01:38:11] <DofLeFou> meaning check to syntax
[01:38:58] <mdupont> so, i have a html text loaded
[01:39:11] <mdupont> the jquery determined that it was text html
[01:39:16] <Whirl3d> DotLeFou, are you asking if there is any way to check if the value of an input text element is valid javascript notation?
[01:39:30] <mdupont> but then on line 7372 of latest.js
[01:39:50] <mdupont> it tries to treat the text as ajax
[01:40:11] <Whirl3d> how so?
[01:41:01] <mdupont> it tries this code : ajaxConvert( s, response );
[01:41:09] <mdupont> but we just determined that it is text
[01:41:13] <mdupont> i dont understand this code
[01:41:33] <mdupont> in this function function done( status, nativeStatusText, responses, headers ) {
[01:42:44] <Whirl3d> do you have a link? The problem I foresee is that it is kind of unreasonable to ask someone to look through 7372+ lines of your code to help you find a problem. If you could duplicate the issue in a smaller test case, that would help us both.
[01:42:44] <FrameFever> does anybody know How I can retrieve the color of a hover style?
[01:42:48] <FrameFever> http://jsfiddle.net/xkEGB/
[01:43:00] <FrameFever> the stile is a clss
[01:43:01] <FrameFever> class
[01:43:21] <Whirl3d> $(".main_item:hover").attr('color');
[01:43:28] <mdupont> ok Whirl3d
[01:43:38] <Whirl3d> or $(".main_item:hover").css("color");
[01:43:41] <mdupont> i will debug something first
[01:43:42] <mdupont> thanks
[01:43:49] <Whirl3d> np
[01:45:36] <FrameFever> Whirl3d: did you test it?

[01:48:14] <Whirl3d> maybe?
[01:51:13] <FrameFever> it would be an hack anyway
[01:54:19] <mdupont>  Whirl3d just use get and not ajax then it works

[02:36:15] <ribot> hi
[02:36:57] <ribot> i'm trying to use .each() and in there get the string id of the iterated element, how to do that?
[02:37:17] <no_one_at_all> $( this ).attr( "id" ) or so?
[02:37:34] <no_one_at_all> or are you looking for the parent?
[02:38:32] <no_one_at_all> I've got a question of my own....how do you get the position of an element relative to the *screen*? prototype.js uses something like viewport() or something-another
[02:39:09] <ribot> no_one_at_all: what you wrote is undefined
[02:39:43] <no_one_at_all> ribot: then...perhaps your element doesn't have an id set?
[02:40:49] <no_one_at_all> ribot: at any rate, "this" within the scope of the .each() function always refers directly to the element, I believe, so you could check *that*. this.id
[02:40:53] <no_one_at_all> lol
[02:40:53] <no_one_at_all> simpler
[02:42:40] <ribot> thanks no_one_at_all :)
[02:43:03] <no_one_at_all> ribot sure
[02:44:22] <ribot> i don't get it, what is the difference between this and $(this), what is only "this"?
[02:45:57] <no_one_at_all> ribot: "this" is the DOM element.
[02:46:08] <no_one_at_all> ribot: $( this ) is a jquery wrapper around the DOM element
[02:47:32] <ribot> ok
[02:51:06] <no_one_at_all> can anybody point me in the direction of a jquery equivalent to prototype's viewportOffset()?
[02:51:19] <no_one_at_all> I want to get the position of an element *relative to the screen*
[02:54:17] <ribot> later
[03:02:06] <ura> Hi, I'm using jQuery Address plugin and I want to use Tabs from jQuery Tools. But it seems there is conflict between plugins. jQuery Address does use "#/path?params" in location.hash and jQuery TOOLS check fro tab name in a way as root.find("[href=" +location.hash+ "]") which leads to exception
[03:02:27] <ura> What is a better way to work around this issue?
[03:02:41] <mehrdad> anyone here worked with timepicker?
[03:03:18] <mehrdad> there is a block of code in its source that i don't know how it works
[03:05:21] <mehrdad> isn't attr() used to retrieve an html attribute?
[03:05:24] <mehrdad> $input.attr('time:' + attrName);
[03:05:45] <Whirl3d> ura, I'm not familiar with jquery Address, but you might want to look at jquery .bbq
[03:05:45] <mehrdad> ^^ it doesn't look like that
[03:05:54] <Whirl3d> ?.bbq @ura
[03:06:10] <Whirl3d> doh! Bot-T is sleeping...
[03:06:16] <ura> Whirl3d, I found it :) Thanks!

[03:06:31] <mehrdad> i know u guys have grudge against me because of the past 'spamming'
[03:06:35] <mehrdad> but let it go plz
[03:07:50] <Whirl3d> mehrdad, it's not a grudge, first of all. It's just that you would rather rely on the folks in this channel to solve your problems than to try to figure it out yourself.
[03:08:04] <mehrdad> believe me, i have tried
[03:08:05] <Whirl3d> You should know what .attr() does
[03:08:13] <ura> Whirl3d, Would BBQ work work fine with jQuery TOOLS tabs? Have you tried already?
[03:08:15] <mehrdad> i know sometimes i am like that

[03:08:56] <pilch> Morning Whirl3d
[03:09:03] <no_one_at_all> ...all your advice....
[03:09:30] <Whirl3d> ura, I'm not sure how jquery tools tabs work...
[03:09:33] <mehrdad> Whirl3d, i usually try to solve stuff on my own, believe me but...
[03:09:52] <pilch> Can anyone recommend a free app for IRC, I don't like to connect via the web for IRC.  Going one better, if there's something that can do AIM, GChat, Skype AND IRC even better. :) Thanks in advance
[03:09:55] <Whirl3d> then how on earth are you confused about .attr()?
[03:10:21] <no_one_at_all> pilch: pidgin or miranda
[03:10:28] <mehrdad> when a job task is forced upon you and u know pretty much jack shit about it, what would u do

[03:10:39] <pilch> hehe, funny names or what! thank you no_one_at_all
[03:10:43] <mehrdad> and consider there is an ultimatum
[03:10:43] <no_one_at_all> pilch: both are good for IRC and IM
[03:10:48] <no_one_at_all> pilch: you're welcome
[03:10:49] <Whirl3d> pidgin, I think
[03:10:53] <ura> jQuery TOOLS should not use hash string, since I'm using it already for state
[03:11:09] <no_one_at_all> pilch: orite, miranda is only on windows. :S
[03:11:35] <pilch> I'm XP so no probs there no_one_at_all
[03:12:03] <fof> have some irccloud invites if you want to give web-based another chance
[03:12:15] <no_one_at_all> pilch: yeah, I just checked your OS version. lol
[03:12:20] <pilch> Seems Miranda's unavailable. http://status.miranda-im.org/
[03:12:25] <ura> jQuery tools uses hash string as part of selector, but hash string contains arbitrary characters which fails to pass jQuery selector validation.
[03:12:55] <no_one_at_all> ura: you ain't kiddin'.
[03:13:14] <no_one_at_all> ura: had an apostrophe catastrophically break a 40 kb script I'm working on.
[03:13:16] <Whirl3d> modify jquery tools to only use hash string for selector
[03:14:25] <ura> I think it should do some basic validation before using hash string in selector, but I'm not the jQuery Tools author, the only thing I can is to find a work around for my case...
[03:14:53] <Whirl3d> what is the tab naming convention then?
[03:15:49] <ura> My (actually jQuery Address) naming convention is like #/some/path?par1=val1&par2=val2
[03:16:14] <standoo> which webapp is developed with jquery ui?
[03:17:13] <ura> And jQuery Tools is yielding to root.find("[href=#/some/path?par1=val1&par2=val2]") with such hash.
[03:17:29] <ura> But jQuery has internal validation which throws an exception on such selector.
[03:17:33] <Whirl3d> see, I hate using hash like that personally. I just use var tabID=hash.split("-")[0] and then the topic on that tab is hash.split("-")[1];
[03:18:43] <Whirl3d> it needs to be root.find("[href='#/some....']");
[03:19:04] <Whirl3d> for some reason, they are missing the quotes around the href value
[03:20:24] <ura> Thanks, I'll try to fill a bug report. Actually it's better to quote \' character in location.hash as well.
[03:20:43] <Whirl3d> try setting a variable to "#/some/path?par=whatever";
[03:21:28] <Whirl3d> then you could do $("[href='"+thatvariable+"']");
[03:22:51] <ura> Here is original code: https://github.com/jquerytools/jquerytools/blob/master/src/tabs/tabs.js#L279
[03:23:29] <Whirl3d> all that line that you linked is doing is checking to make sure that your current url is has a hash value (meaning you should be in a tab) and that you are creating tabs by "a" anchor elements and that an anchor element exists that points to the current hash value.
[03:23:34] <ura> than it should be something like root.find("[href='" +escape_quote_and_bracket(location.hash)+ "']")
[03:24:58] <ura> But root.find is throwing an exception because the hash is not a tab name, it contains a state of my application.
[03:27:05] <ura> But it's really a problem of missing quote. Thanks for pointing this!
[03:28:25] <Whirl3d> when you are creating your tabs with $(selector).tabs(); it sets selector as your root element and then looks at the selector's children for anchor elements to be used for tabs. When it finds them, it uses their href attribute to name them.
[03:30:15] <Whirl3d> then, subsequent anchor elements can address your tabs by referring either to A) their href attribute value or B) their index number
[03:30:41] <ura> I was about to fill a bug request, but it seems it was already reported two months ago: https://github.com/jquerytools/jquerytools/pull/596
[03:30:41] <socialhapy> â Pull request on jquerytools by bbodien (2m, 3d ago): Tabs bug fix (attrib selector quotes)
[03:31:27] <Whirl3d> but you have access to the source, so fix it yrself...
[03:32:13] <ura> Of course, but just as temporary measure, I want to use script from CDN.
[03:32:21] <ura> (from public CDN)
[03:32:46] <Whirl3d> and I'd be willing to bet that you wouldn't have this problem if you weren't storing your application state in your hash. Use .data to store your application state and then you can use simple hashes like #home and #contact
[03:33:11] <Whirl3d> in which case the selectors would work the way they are now
[03:33:24] <ura> I really need to store a state, I want my links to be bookmarkable.
[03:33:26] <jarr0dsz> hi
[03:35:05] <ura> Many parameters (like query string, page number, date, etc.) is needed to be present in hash string, to allow user to bookmark results or send a links to friends.
[03:35:47] <Whirl3d> then you need to parse your hash before you pass it to your tab managers
[03:36:15] <ura> I think jQuery Tools better should not touch hash string at all. If I want to open specific tab I can open it with "open" call of tabs API.
[03:37:33] <ura> But lookup of hash string is hard coded in jQuery Tools. The only way I can avoid it is to set conf.tabs to something not equal to "a"
[03:37:49] <Whirl3d> but they want to make it so you can setup links in your markup that automatically open the tabs without the need to use the api explicitly. In other words, once I'm initialized, I know that my acnchor elements with a certain format hash string will open a tab...no need to script anything there.
[03:37:59] <ura> (condition would be short circuited)
[03:38:43] <Whirl3d> what if you set conf.tabs to a class name like ".tabClass"
[03:38:55] <ura> But it greatly reduce flexibility, it monopolize use of hash string...
[03:40:25] <ura> Whirl3d, Great idea! I was considered to set it to 'span', but really it not just an element but a selector with it's full power. I has a hesitation that I can't use href in span, but with class selector I can still use 'a' elements :)
[03:40:56] <Whirl3d> exactly
[03:41:13] <Whirl3d> and if you can't use a elements, it falls back to index
[03:41:20] <Whirl3d> so you are safe either way
[03:41:50] <mehrdad> what does this.each() do where this is an element, it iterates over attribs, subelements or ...?
[03:42:08] <Whirl3d> then you could pass a hash to your own custom hash parse function that looked like #tab=3 and your own parse function would call open(tab3) using the api
[03:42:53] <ura> Whirl3d, Thank you very much! With selecting by class, root.find is not called, and everything works great without patching jQuery Tools :)
[03:42:57] <Whirl3d> mehrdad, it sounds like you are reading the beginning of a plugin where "this" refers to the actual jquery object itself
[03:43:10] <Whirl3d> ;)
[03:44:12] <Whirl3d> it's complicated, but you can find out more if you read up on writing plugins. Specifically using "closures", I believe
[03:44:42] <mehrdad> Whirl3d, no http://www.pastebin.com/cPthpdZ6
[03:44:46] <mehrdad> the return part
[03:44:51] <mehrdad> thx for answering tho
[03:45:02] <mehrdad> small chunk of code really
[03:46:15] <mehrdad> this is an element , i am sure of that
[03:46:22] <Whirl3d> where's the beginning of it...it likely will state $(function () {   and end in })(jQuery);
[03:46:24] <angelazou> hello, I have this php variable whose value I want to pass to jquery
[03:46:44] <angelazou> should I do something like var name = '$name' ?
[03:46:58] <angelazou> or var name = ' . $name . ';?
[03:46:58] <mehrdad> it is in the context of a function that is called by apply() method and passing this which is an element
[03:48:03] <mehrdad> edited it to include the function definition
[03:48:34] <Whirl3d> mehrdad, see, this is what I am talking about: You want to provide a tiny window into a huge problem and then tell the people that are trying to help you that they are wrong. But historically, they have been right once you expose the full problem.
[03:48:53] <mehrdad> that seems completely vague to me, coming from a c# background sorry
[03:49:44] <mehrdad> the full problem, is huge and it will consume more of ur times
[03:49:49] <Whirl3d> the problem is that in order to use the .each method of a jquery object, you have to have a jquery object. You can't call .each on a regular object
[03:50:21] <Whirl3d> var something=this; something.jqueryfucntionname() will ONLY work if something is a jquery object.
[03:50:52] <Whirl3d> which means that somehwere, someone passed the jquery object to this function you have part of.
[03:51:03] <Whirl3d> Which is the common way to write a plugin
[03:51:19] <Whirl3d> otherwise you would use $(this).each()
[03:51:30] <Whirl3d> or $(this).somejquerymethod
[03:51:52] <Whirl3d> now you could use $.each(array, function ()), but that's not what your code says
[03:52:58] <Whirl3d> by passing jquery the jquery object into a plugin function, it enables you to use the syntax $(selector).myCustomFunction()
[03:53:24] <angelazou> anyone?
[03:53:49] <angelazou> I've also created this simple demo, but it doesn't seem to work http://jsfiddle.net/55jmn/
[03:53:51] <Whirl3d> angelazou, where are you getting the data from php
[03:54:01] <mehrdad> yes it is the latter i am guessing
[03:54:05] <mehrdad> a selector
[03:54:21] <mehrdad> edited it again to include the caller code
[03:54:22] <angelazou> um, it's from something called shortcode (in wordpress)
[03:54:58] <mehrdad> i'm gonna look up what select.each means then
[03:55:08] * mehrdad opens up jquery docs
[03:55:28] <Whirl3d> angelazou, it's .val(value). not .val=
[03:55:46] <angelazou> in the example, the PHP variable is going to fill up the value of price variable
[03:56:36] <angelazou> do you mean like this? http://jsfiddle.net/55jmn/1/
[03:56:39] <angelazou> it still doesn't work...
[03:56:51] <nail_> quote your selectors
[03:56:53] <mehrdad> ok so it iterates over the selected elements in my case
[03:57:16] <mehrdad> tho it clearly selects one element if i am not mistaken
[03:57:28] <mehrdad> maybe that is why i was confused
[03:57:54] <angelazou> I quoted my selectors, still doing nothing... http://jsfiddle.net/55jmn/3/
[03:57:59] <Whirl3d> $(#total_price).val($(#field_9n6ljw).val() * price);
[03:58:26] <angelazou> oh
[03:58:26] <Whirl3d> $("#total_price").val($("#field_pnnngkd").val()*price);
[03:58:43] <Whirl3d> cache your selectors
[03:58:53] <Whirl3d> var tp=$("#total_price");
[03:59:44] <Whirl3d> var totalPrice=tp.val();
[04:00:08] <Whirl3d> but you may need to use var totalPrice=Math.parseFloat(tp.val());
[04:00:23] <Whirl3d> to convert your total price into a decimal
[04:01:10] <Whirl3d> mehrdad, $(this).each() will iterate over the elements (even if its just one) in the jquery collection of $(this);
[04:01:23] <Whirl3d> but this.each() is not the same as $(this).each()
[04:01:46] <angelazou> I don't know why...I copied the line like you mentioned, still... http://jsfiddle.net/55jmn/4/
[04:02:29] <mehrdad> sooo /this/ is referring to some other this than the passed in this?
[04:02:31] <bnb_dev> on using $.post , it also posting the entire web page?
[04:02:33] <mehrdad> jeez
[04:02:44] <mehrdad> and that is a parent object this right?
[04:03:41] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/55jmn/5/
[04:03:49] <Whirl3d> angelazou, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/55jmn/5/
[04:04:01] <Whirl3d> your "price" variable was a string value
[04:04:06] <mehrdad> let me scrunize the code more
[04:04:32] <mehrdad> scrutinize *
[04:04:51] <mehrdad> 8-|
[04:05:32] <angelazou> Whirl3d: it makes sense to write it this way, but why doesn't the end result change its value? http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/55jmn/5/
[04:06:11] <pilch> I went with Trillian in the end :) - Miranda was shite
[04:06:51] <Whirl3d> trillian used to rock...
[04:07:30] <mehrdad> pilch, may i suggest u mibbit ?
[04:07:43] <mehrdad> very good alternative to desktop clients
[04:08:07] <pilch> mibbit.. Sure, gladly accepting any recommendations
[04:08:08] <Whirl3d> angelazou, the change event isn't firing. Try using .click
[04:08:33] <mehrdad> http://www.mibbit.com/
[04:08:39] <fof> i think freenode hosts qwebirc too
[04:08:41] <angelazou> Whirl3d: umm...no luck
[04:08:50] <angelazou> is there something special about the numbers field?
[04:09:03] <mehrdad> ahh right mibbit has no support for freenode
[04:09:04] <Whirl3d> you can't use .val() on a span element
[04:09:05] <mehrdad> :/
[04:09:11] <Whirl3d> you need to use .text();
[04:09:17] <fof> http://webchat.freenode.net/
[04:09:26] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/55jmn/11/
[04:10:07] <mehrdad> it sucks mibbit has no freenode support
[04:10:14] <mehrdad> it is very good otherwise
[04:10:56] <fof> probably more that freenode doesnt want mibbit connections :)
[04:11:06] <mehrdad> yes i think so
[04:12:07] <Whirl3d> angelzou, is that what you wanted?
[04:13:02] <pilch> Trillian for IRC and AIM seems good for me for the time being :) but thanks for all the recommends
[04:13:50] <mehrdad> pilch, i use mirc when on windows
[04:13:54] <mehrdad> it says it is a trialware
[04:14:03] <mehrdad> and i was going to use it only for so long
[04:14:09] <angelazou> Whirl3d: thanks. I wanted to round the value so it doesn't look like 0.3000000004, I used         tp.toFixed(2);  but why didn't it take effect?
[04:14:32] <mehrdad> but then it appeared that i can use it beyond the trial period which is weird O_o
[04:31:14] <Whirl3d> you have to convert tp to a number to get toFixed() to work
[04:31:24] <Whirl3d> tp=parseFloat(tp);
[04:31:39] <Whirl3d> tp=tp.toFixed(2); should work

[05:20:09] <knubbze_> hi; I have a $('td[contenteditable]').click() function that replaces the contents with an <input>
[05:20:20] <knubbze_> how can I prevent that event from triggering when I click that <input>?
[05:21:14] <dabear> ?stoppropagation @ knubbze_
[05:21:14] <bot-t> knubbze_, event.stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[05:21:34] <dabear> has to be done on the input it self, or any parent underneath the td
[05:21:50] <knubbze_> dabear: thanks. so I basically do $('td[contenteditable] input').click(function (ev) { ev.stopPropagation(); }); ?
[05:22:34] <dabear> yep, or you can not do that, and filter on ev.target in your t $('td[contenteditable]').click..-handler
[05:22:58] <knubbze_> alright thanks a lot

[05:48:58] <bot-t> aqeel, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[05:50:57] <pilch> I've only recently 'found' the JSBin and JSFiddle - cool IDE's
[05:51:48] <pilch> I think they're great tools and I take my hat off to the people who make those types of web tools available to the masses

[06:23:14] <angelazou> is it from this web server, or from a central location?

[06:24:02] <cloaked> I am trying to create a dropdown menu using Superfish library...
[06:24:15] <cloaked> But its not working at all
[06:25:27] <xec> angelazou: you can feed the Date object a time to use, but if you don't it's going to be local (client) time
[06:25:31] <fof> it's the client's date
[06:25:55] <angelazou> I know this, but I'm using this countdown plugin that seems to have the wrong time and date
[06:26:21] <angelazou> there are 2 issues involved, first I'd have to know what's the source providing the time for Date()
[06:26:39] <cloaked> http://www.pastebin.com/twXha6z7
[06:26:41] <angelazou> and I also need to know if there is a timezone lag in between
[06:27:00] <cloaked> the html file source code..
[06:28:08] <angelazou> but I'm not even sure where did it obtain the current time...
[06:28:24] <xec> angelazou: good luck with that
[06:29:40] <angelazou> btw, what does this line mean? timestamp	: 0
[06:31:27] <cloaked> help anyone??
[06:31:48] <fof> taking you back into the past maybe
[06:32:51] <xec> cloaked: any error messages?
[06:33:11] <xec> fof: 'tis the beginning of time!!
[06:35:59] <angelazou> xec: when you said local time, do you mean the time on the server or client?

[06:37:14] <xec> cloaked: did you include superfish after the jq lib?
[06:37:47] <xec> angelazou: i'm going to guess client, seeing as i wrote the word "client"
[06:37:54] <fris> aqeel what are you trying to do in that equation
[06:38:04] <aqeel> ge4t the margin
[06:38:04] <cloaked> xec: ya, I have included the superfish.js file
[06:38:20] <xec> cloaked: and jquery.min.js *after*
[06:38:20] <aqeel> based on css %....
[06:38:59] <cloaked> xec: Oh, does the order also matter? Which order should it be?
[06:39:13] <aqeel> li.width returns li width about 15px .....width removes all info.....padding,border, block or inline
[06:39:19] <xec> cloaked: dependencies first
[06:39:30] <xec> cloaked: a jq plugin depends on jq
[06:40:10] <aqeel> i would like this li.width to take 30 %
[06:40:16] <xec> cloaked: but, it seems you got it included twice?
[06:40:20] <aqeel> and it is not taking
[06:41:52] <zatan_> hi, how can I remove class when another ('li a') pressed?
[06:42:01] <cloaked> xec: actually I had a doubt that one was not working.. so later added a local one
[06:42:26] <cloaked> does that matter?
[06:42:39] <zatan_> http://jsfiddle.net/Sv2uq/
[06:44:19] <xec> zatan_: something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/Sv2uq/1/
[06:44:27] <fris> aqeel ever tried parseInt of the css value?
[06:44:49] <fris> like var padding = parseInt($("#test").css("padding-top"));
[06:45:20] <aqeel> ??
[06:45:51] <fris> would get the value of padding-top
[06:45:59] <xec> cloaked: yes, it matters :)
[06:46:21] <aqeel> well i would like to get width of li and not padding top
[06:46:53] <fris> then use parseInt for that value
[06:46:57] <aqeel> li{width :80%} is in css
[06:47:02] <fof> zatan_: less elegant version of xec's: http://jsfiddle.net/6t8pc/
[06:47:54] <xec> fof: no need to loop, .removeClass() will apply to the entire collection
[06:48:14] <fof> true, ty
[06:48:35] <aqeel> fris.....any idea why li.width() not taking 30% into account?
[06:48:59] <fof> http://jsfiddle.net/6t8pc/1/ :)
[06:49:28] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/FESfG/1/
[06:50:41] <zatan_> thanks xec and fof
[06:51:42] <fof> zatan_: xec cached the selector with 'var a =', it's good practice
[06:51:54] <fof> mine selected twice for the same thing
[06:54:14] <aqeel> http://api.jquery.com/width/.....................how to make this select the given width?
[06:54:30] <aqeel> it selects the element width
[06:54:30] <xec> you mean return?
[06:54:39] <Alianora> Hi all
[06:54:41] <aqeel> yup...
[06:55:27] <xec> aqeel: i fail to see the distinction, whats the difference between given width and element width
[06:56:04] <Alianora> I have a problem with binding  to function inside the class: http://jsfiddle.net/cfzw3/1/  How to solve this?
[06:57:14] <aqeel> given width ...we specifiy..........element with the width by default.......li has bullet with it......so li.width()...returns the width that is from bullet point to starting the first string.......alpha or number
[06:57:33] <xec> Alianora: what is this code supposed to do? what is bindElement ?
[06:58:07] <Alianora> xec: this is function witch will bind class functions to actions in form
[06:58:46] <Alianora> there shoul be something like this.testSelect.bind('change', this.testSelectChanged());
[07:01:16] <fris> aqeel http://jsfiddle.net/jLm6J/
[07:03:55] <aqeel> wow fris thanks.....this will be of some help...but how u mention to ge tthe li width......paresFloat
[07:05:06] <aqeel> so it is true li.width()..............indded will not take into account the width speciifed...
[07:05:39] <fris> the first one i did, got the value in px, then that will get the % value, var width = ($('li').css('width')); would returen the value in px, the onei showed you converts it to a %
[07:07:29] <aqeel> thanks.....
[07:07:33] <xec> Alianora: something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/cfzw3/2/
[07:08:01] <Alianora> xec: big thanks!
[07:09:43] <Alianora> xec: If I will have 2 classes with function bindElement there can be self in both or it should be unique variable?
[07:10:59] <xec> you don't need the self part, i was just testing
[07:11:06] <xec> Alianora: http://jsfiddle.net/cfzw3/3/
[07:11:40] <Alianora> xec: thanks againe :D
[07:11:49] <Alianora> again*

[07:14:56] <xec> see console when you change the first dropdown, myClass is now the latest iteration
[07:15:20] <xec> i.e. test2
[07:16:38] <xec> Alianora: if you're looking for a better way to structure your code, i recommend http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/3/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-In-Depth
[07:17:06] <Alianora> xec: values are correct: http://jsfiddle.net/cfzw3/5/
[07:17:47] <xec> Alianora: you're now reselecting based on the event
[07:18:43] <xec> it's an awful lot of ceremonial code for no gain
[07:19:06] <Alianora> Ok... I'll read link You just send me
[07:19:22] <stndoostds> xec: thanks for the pattern link
[07:20:34] <xec> :)
[07:22:32] <Alianora> xec: but without event I cannot read select value... am I wrong?
[07:22:54] <Alianora> 'this' will not work inside class function
[07:23:27] <xec> Alianora: you can pass this from the event handler
[07:24:11] <xec> hold on
[07:24:31] <xec> Alianora: this is better http://jsfiddle.net/cfzw3/6/

[08:24:18] <aqeel> what is going wrong

[08:27:46] <aqeel> xec can help

[08:30:11] <aqeel> and how can i subtract 3 li widths from the div parent container
[08:30:27] <aqeel> parent 80%

[08:40:08] <aqeel> well yes...for this segment
[08:41:07] <aqeel> or any alternative method u may suggest
[08:44:11] <aqeel> if fixed width then would have been simple but using percentage.....and calculating like fixed value...
[08:47:16] <aqeel> or how to calculate......90% to 80% of its continer and divide by 2 thus this is the value i need
[08:48:44] <saxicek> hi, i am trying to serialize form that has 2 submit buttons (input tag with name attribute) but it seems that call to serialize() ignores it... any hint please?
[08:56:07] <dabear> saxicek: create two extra inputs, both with type="hidden"
[08:56:34] <dabear> and copy the submit buttons data there
[08:57:31] <Looney> what should be data type of a document element shown in (FireBug) inside < > (angled braces) ? ?
[08:58:35] <saxicek> dabear: ok, and how do I find out the value from the clicked button?
[08:59:56] <saxicek> dabear: or you mean copy the data from button to hidden once the form is submited?
[09:00:13] <dabear> no, before
[09:00:36] <dabear> populate the hidden input field/fields on click of the button
[09:00:58] <dabear> a form submit happens afterwards
[09:01:40] <dabear> having two submit buttons with different behavior is bad usability though
[09:02:18] <dabear> e.g. you should instead have one submit button, with a checkbox or similar to enable differentiation
[09:03:02] <saxicek> dabear: well it is a poll so I have Yes/No buttons with some other fields and want to submit the form immediately when one of the buttons is clicked
[09:03:32] <dabear> have two checkboxes, yes and no
[09:03:37] <dabear> and one submit button
[09:03:42] <Looney> I have a simple question
[09:04:03] <saxicek> but it means one unnecessary click ;-)
[09:04:07] <Looney> I have used $.ajax for retrieving an xml file
[09:04:21] <dabear> saxicek: no, users expect that
[09:04:23] <dabear> in general
[09:04:31] <Looney> I can view it as a document
[09:04:37] <dabear> Looney: yep, and?
[09:05:08] <Looney> but I can only getElementsByTagName
[09:05:24] <Looney> so dabear what should I do ?
[09:05:46] <dabear> Looney: you haven't stated your problem yet
[09:06:37] <dabear> $(foo).find("your_mommy")
[09:06:43] <Looney> I want to display/search the data with respect to the attributes of the tags
[09:06:54] <Looney> where foo is the document ?
[09:07:30] <Looney> dabear: wish me luck as I am going to find "your_mommy"
[09:08:00] <dabear> $.post('url.xml', function(data) {
[09:08:00] <dabear>   var $child = $(data).find('child');
[09:08:00] <dabear> })
[09:08:12] <dabear> taken from the docs, here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[09:08:45] <Looney> thanks dabear
[09:21:31] <ortix> i'm trying to pass an ajax request but the page keeps reloading and the data is not passed to my php file...
[09:21:33] <ortix> here is my code
[09:21:34] <ortix> http://pastebin.com/nZcaK0pp
[09:22:10] <ortix> in the source everything is loaded fine. The form is loaded with, the ajax code is loaded, jquery itself is loaded
[09:22:27] <phil-adept> try return false at the end
[09:22:55] <saxicek> dabear: thank for your help
[09:22:55] <saxicek> bye all
[09:23:06] <phil-adept> ortix: have you tried that?
[09:23:13] <ortix> return false at the end? it is already there..
[09:23:23] <ortix> btw, i am quite new to jquery
[09:23:30] <phil-adept> my bad! lol
[09:23:34] <ortix> :D
[09:24:15] <phil-adept> ortix: what are you returning from /plugins/k2/test.php
[09:24:15] <ortix> the php file echoes the $_GET of the itemid and also 'test' for testing purposes
[09:24:30] <phil-adept> ok, and in firebug what happens?
[09:24:50] <nFFF> http://www.safeguardarmour.co.uk/bullet-proof-vests/tactical-armour/commander/ -> can someone have a look at this markup and tell me why the selector $('.zoomPad img') isn't selecting?
[09:24:52] <ortix> not sure what you mean by what happens..
[09:25:37] <phil-adept> is the page being reloaded? Redirected? Is it going to the form submission page? Are there any errors in the console?
[09:25:52] <ortix> ooh like that
[09:25:57] <phil-adept> firebug will let you find the answers to them and will help your debugging :D
[09:25:58] <ortix> the page is reloading
[09:26:08] <ortix> let me see if it pops up errors
[09:26:11] <phil-adept> right, so it's not posting the ajax call
[09:26:26] <phil-adept> or it's trying to and there may be a JS error stopping it
[09:26:34] <ortix> $(document).ready is not a function
[09:26:37] <phil-adept> resulting in it then continuing to submit the form
[09:26:38] <ortix> well there we go.. ;P
[09:26:47] <ortix> so what does that mean? :S
[09:27:38] <phil-adept> well are you using any other JS framework /. library?
[09:27:46] <nFFF> The makr
[09:27:56] <nFFF> The markup here: http://jsfiddle.net/MgfsK/ the selector works fine
[09:28:07] <nFFF> Its a copy and apste from here http://www.safeguardarmour.co.uk/bullet-proof-vests/tactical-armour/commander/ where it doesn't work
[09:28:09] <nFFF> Any ideax?
[09:28:17] <ortix> i'm using mootools as well :')
[09:29:25] <phil-adept> ortix: You may have libraries clashing over $(). I'm not too sure without knowing the project so take a look here http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[09:30:05] <phil-adept> ortix: another link for you here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2810399/jquery-and-mootools-conflict
[09:30:17] <ortix> great! i'll take a look at those
[09:30:18] <ortix> also
[09:30:23] <ortix> i've neve rhad this issue
[09:30:29] <katnegermis> whois
[09:30:41] <ortix> i've been using jquery a long time without any issues (doesn't mean that i understand how it works lol)
[09:30:47] <phil-adept> It may not be your problem but it's wort investigating. What I suggest is remove all other JS apart from the core jQuery JS files and the one for your ajax call. If it works then you know htats your issue
[09:30:48] <ortix> i'll try troobleshooting!
[09:31:01] <phil-adept> worth*
[09:31:10] <phil-adept> that's*
[09:31:12] * phil-adept shoots his typist
[09:34:06] <nFFF> Anyone :<
[09:34:12] <nFFF> The markup here: http://jsfiddle.net/MgfsK/ the selector works fine, Its a copy and paste from here http://www.safeguardarmour.co.uk/bullet-proof-vests/tactical-armour/commander/ where it doesn't work, any ideas why this is?

[10:37:21] <nFFF> Guys Ive got some plugin thats adding HTML to the DOM
[10:37:30] <nFFF> I need to edit this html with javascript
[10:37:35] <nFFF> How to do this
[10:39:55] <lulzplzk1hx> Is asking for help on jQuery UI okay here?
[10:40:48] <lulzplzk1hx> Im trying to use a script a friend of mine wrote on this website, for embeddin Flickr on a webpage. It uses jQuery UI to do some buttons in the top left. You can see an example ere (as a Google gadget): http://ghs.skylinerobotics.org/sandbox
[10:40:52] <kalia> http://jsfiddle.net/ASp2g/
[10:41:02] <lulzplzk1hx> f you over over the image you will notice some buttons on the top left.
[10:41:20] <kalia> i am not gettinf the output on the page
[10:41:37] <lulzplzk1hx> Now, we tried to implement it on this page (but couldnt do it as a Google gadget, and so its slightly different): http://www.skylinerobotics.org/media/events/2011-kettering-photos/
[10:42:25] <lulzplzk1hx> We get an error in Firebug saying that jQuery("<button id='something'>sometext</button>").button(a) is not a valid function
[10:42:32] <lulzplzk1hx> Sorry, remove that a, typo.
[10:42:47] <lulzplzk1hx> Anyway, its weird because jQuery UI is loaded off of Googles server which contains the Button module.
[10:42:50] <lulzplzk1hx> ANyone hahve an idea wats up?
[10:43:01] <lulzplzk1hx> (Sorry, my ekeyboard is being kind of crazy right now.)
[10:43:27] <nFFF> lulzplzk1hx ok so the plugin isnt being recognised
[10:43:33] <dnsdds> Is there an (easy) way to animate an element from an absolute position to its natural static position?
[10:43:37] <nFFF> or your jquery is firing before the plugin is loaded
[10:44:59] <lulzplzk1hx> nFFF: Probably te second. old on.
[10:49:36] <LukeNukem> how to grab element by rel?
[10:53:09] <lulzplzk1hx> Well, $(document).ready() made it suck on"Loading..." nFFF
[10:53:11] <lulzplzk1hx> Any idea why?
[11:00:14] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/mtkK3/ -> this doesn't work when the html is added dynamically, any ideas?
[11:00:19] <nFFF> lulzplzk1hx no idea
[11:00:33] <nFFF> try
[11:00:34] <nFFF> $(window).load(function() {
[11:11:39] <lulzplzk1hx> nFFF: Not workin.
[11:11:42] <lulzplzk1hx> Neiter window.load or document.ready
[11:11:47] <lulzplzk1hx> ALways sayin .button is not a function
[11:12:28] <nFFF> IS your plugin loaded in the header or footer?
[11:12:54] <nFFF> Make sure the plugin is loaded first
[11:13:28] <lulzplzk1hx> Hea[BHeader
[11:13:40] <lulzplzk1hx> wWWait
[11:13:58] <lulzplzk1hx> we load jQuery => jQuery UI -> Flickr slidesow
[11:14:03] <lulzplzk1hx> Tat order.
[11:17:08] <mats__> i'm using .not(':containsâ¦.) on a table and remove tbodys depending on what i select with a drop down menu, problem is that when i remove something the first time, it's gone. i can't just select something else in the drop down and show thatâ¦ how can i fix this?
[11:17:53] <lulzplzk1hx> Okay, for some reason jQuery UI Button isnt loadin properly on tis pae
[11:18:09] <lulzplzk1hx> http://www.skylinerobotics.org/media/events/2011-kettering-photos/
[11:18:11] <lulzplzk1hx> Anyone know why?
[11:18:28] <lulzplzk1hx> You can see I call jQuery UI rom Google servers which should pull in the Button module
[11:19:05] <XOXO1> hello. I got a fixed size div and I'm adding new paragraphs into it. how can I scroll to bottom every time I add new <p> ?
[11:20:31] <msch> how can i make $.ajax().error() parse the json response my server sends like $.ajax().success() does?
[11:21:58] <Alianora> msch: error is called whem there is no response from server... so there is no json to parse...
[11:22:26] <msch> Alianora: nope, my server returns Content-Type: application/json and actual content, but HTTP code 412. I'm coding against an API
[11:22:37] <ortix> hi guys i'm back with le question
[11:22:56] <ortix> it seems that my ajax request works but succes is not being run
[11:23:10] <ortix> my data is being fed to the DB and i can see that the script works
[11:23:20] <ortix> but apaprently it did not 'succeed' even though it did
[11:23:27] <ortix> and the functions under succeed don't run :(
[11:24:11] <ortix> http://pastebin.com/2UbkY1MA is the script
[11:26:11] <ortix> oh wait
[11:26:18] <ortix> maybe i found the culprit
[11:26:47] <ortix> yep
[11:26:53] <ortix> forgot the / in front of the index.php
[11:26:58] <ortix> god bless firebug :')
[11:30:37] <adac> How to encode the URL here: https://gist.github.com/1860724 ?
[11:33:03] <mathi> hey
[11:33:12] <mathi> how can I use jQuery in a web worker?
[11:33:21] <mathi> I have the following error when i'm using a selector: Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[11:37:08] <knubbze_> I have a table with a LOT of columns; I would like to hide every thing that does not fit on the screen and have some sort {>> <<} button that you can click to display the rest
[11:37:14] <knubbze_> does jquery{,ui} have something for that
[11:37:17] <knubbze_> or do I write it myself?
[11:38:22] <lulzplzk1hx> 1
[11:38:27] <knubbze_> 2
[11:41:39] <Nuno147> anyone aware of a bug in django webserver ? the issue I am facing is that it direct images from a css while using "img/a.png" for example while adding the css file ?
[11:42:15] <Nuno147> for example : http://127.0.0.1:8000/media_site/js/fancybox/jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.css/fancybox.png/
[11:42:34] <Nuno147> while it should be : http://127.0.0.1:8000/media_site/js/fancybox/fancybox.png
[11:43:25] * K3|Chris just tried to click 127.0.0.1 links, is ashamed
[11:47:44] <trisox> lol
[11:50:54] <K3|Chris> in my defense, i tend to click links before reading them, well in "safe" channels anyway...
[11:51:57] <mats_> can you get back elements you removed with .remove? or do i need to use hide for that?
[11:52:56] <K3|Chris> mats_: not sure, but sounds like hide is better suited for what you need
[11:56:28] <xec> mats_: it is possible if you cache/save it in a var, but it won't belong anywhere so you would have to reattach it to the DOM
[11:57:06] <xec> mats_: like K3|Chris said you prob want hide instead
[11:57:26] <K3|Chris> when I do similar stuff I hide and show anyway
[12:09:18] <yamahaalex37> is it ok to leave vital functions to jquery without a fallback?
[12:09:34] <yamahaalex37> example: login/register slider
[12:09:43] <yamahaalex37> if for some reason it fails, a user can never register
[12:11:29] <K3|Chris> yamahaalex37: most modern sites break irreparably without JS
[12:11:46] <yamahaalex37> ok, i suppose
[12:12:13] <K3|Chris> and I can't see jQ fouling up unless you do something really wrong
[12:12:28] <K3|Chris> like a syntax error etc, but then it's your own fault, not jQ being ropy
[12:12:30] <yamahaalex37> yeah true
[12:12:36] <yamahaalex37> except on fricken joomla
[12:12:47] <yamahaalex37> which is mootools dependent, it can conflict
[12:12:50] <Manehattan> can someone give me a hint on how to create methods with ".on()" that replace ".live()", so the handlers will also be added to the elements injected later?
[12:12:53] <K3|Chris> :\
[12:13:16] <K3|Chris> I'm not a fan of joomla, or PHP for that matter
[12:13:38] <yamahaalex37> im a fan of php, and joomla
[12:13:43] <yamahaalex37> how can you not be a fan of php?
[12:13:48] <yamahaalex37> or at least know its importance
[12:14:39] <Manehattan> javascript all the way: Node.js + jQuery + MongoDB
[12:14:54] <yamahaalex37> i suppose, i just need to catch up
[12:15:08] <yamahaalex37> damn, makes me rethink what im doing
[12:15:13] <Manehattan> so, no hint on that ".on()" business?
[12:15:29] <yamahaalex37> was that a play .on words?
[12:16:50] <Manehattan> no, jQuery 1.7 deprecrates the ".live()" method, according to the docs it will be replaced by ".on()", but on the docs for the ".on()" method it says I can't be used to bind to injected elements automatically
[12:17:39] <K3|Chris> yamahaalex37: php is an undocumented unmaintained buggy mess
[12:17:47] <yamahaalex37> :(
[12:17:55] <yamahaalex37> its actually very documented at php.net
[12:18:05] <mats_> hide it is, thanks guys
[12:18:12] <yamahaalex37> more than any code ive used, including its mysql functions
[12:18:19] <K3|Chris> but yes it's still widely popular, for no good reason as far as I can tell
[12:18:25] <Manehattan> I often curse about undefined or badly defined behaviour on PHP
[12:18:46] <Manehattan> I can't believe such a messy soup can be so popular
[12:18:57] <yamahaalex37> is there a powerful MVC framework yet for js
[12:19:19] <techrush> lol K3|Chris for no good reason ?
[12:19:40] <K3|Chris> techrush: well one reason: idiots can write it and it still kinda works
[12:20:05] <yamahaalex37> hmm, i dono, i find js far easier than php
[12:20:08] <yamahaalex37> php is... awkward
[12:20:09] <K3|Chris> instead of something object oriented which requires much neater code
[12:20:14] <yamahaalex37> doesnt mean its easy to write though
[12:20:26] <techrush> one of those guys....lemme geuss you are a student or unemployed ?
[12:20:33] <techrush> or both ?
[12:20:34] <yamahaalex37> who
[12:20:49] <Manehattan> yamahaalex37: http://locomotivejs.org/ very powerful, it gives you mvc and still gives you access to the node.js power underneath
[12:22:07] <yamahaalex37> nice thanks
[12:23:10] <yamahaalex37> when will we see a js framework like WP Joomla etc
[12:23:54] <K3|Chris> well JS isn't really meant for server-side applications
[12:24:02] <riyonuk> I'm really stumped on this one. My item count wont show for firefox/safari, shows fine for chrome - http://yellowleafhammocks.com/
[12:24:43] <K3|Chris> riyonuk: what item count?
[12:24:58] <riyonuk> Add an item to your cart. It doesn't update it, though I can see the html sometimes updates.
[12:25:08] <riyonuk> the little basket icon in the top right.
[12:25:56] <riyonuk> This is the jQuery for that -> http://pastie.org/3409936
[12:26:21] <Manehattan> yamahaalex37: See, node is a great framework for a specific kind of application: One with many dynamic requests. If you do old boring Request->Response with MVC, you should consider Django or Rails. Node is brilliant if you do loads of AJAX or even server pushed events with socket.io
[12:26:58] <riyonuk> And in Safari, if I refresh, I see the total, but then it goes back to zero, which makes me rage.
[12:27:03] <yamahaalex37> Manehattan, right now, yes i need big boring websites
[12:27:18] <yamahaalex37> but im into game dev, so that stuff really interests me
[12:27:57] <yamahaalex37> why do all the jquery doc samples have semicolons ;
[12:27:59] <Manehattan> yamahaalex37: Then consider Rails or Django... I've even once made a mini-mmorpg with node, socket.io and mongodb, only with HTML5 canvas
[12:28:23] <Manehattan> yamahaalex37: because ; is good practice in JS?
[12:28:29] <yamahaalex37> i would definitely go with html5/js before the rest. i see a big future there
[12:29:12] <WesleyL> riyonuk: you're putting the complete html in the span
[12:29:33] <WesleyL> so you're adding another <span class="pricedisplay"> in the one already there
[12:29:54] <Manehattan> yamahaalex37: It's awesome. Too bad the world is not that fast catching on. For example, I dropped IE support on my sites because even 9.0 doesn't support half the awesome stuff
[12:30:15] <yamahaalex37> yeah ie9 sucks
[12:30:59] <DrMabuse> no
[12:31:00] <yamahaalex37> when I saw team fortress 2 in a browser with webGL... it was a monumental realization
[12:31:17] <DrMabuse> its correct
[12:32:15] <WesleyL> also riyonuk, that load call doesn't make any sense
[12:34:38] <Manehattan> yamahaalex37: You may also consider CouchDB and couchapps, it's a great concept for modern MVC
[12:34:54] <yamahaalex37> cool thanks a lot i will look at that
[12:35:38] <Manehattan> yamahaalex37: What I am saying is: Don't stick with PHP, because PHP is stuck in the 90's
[12:35:58] <yamahaalex37> :/
[12:36:10] <yamahaalex37> ill still probably need to let it mature a bit, i dont have time to start from scratch
[12:36:54] <yamahaalex37> unless there is a nice MVC that took care of auth and some basics
[12:38:06] <Manehattan> yamahaalex37: passport is easy auth for node.js... with loads of plugins for openid and oauth
[12:39:00] <yamahaalex37> nicehmm
[12:39:13] <yamahaalex37> lol who is this guy he makes everything? © 2011 Jared Hanson
[12:40:01] <Manehattan> yamahaalex37: Yeah... I also program Haskell, and every second project in Web programming bears the name Snoyberg there
[12:40:13] <yamahaalex37> lol
[12:46:51] <riyonuk> WesleyL: I didn't write it, which is why I'm having trouble understanding some of it :)
[13:00:28] <yamahaalex37> in jquery is call back any amounto f code?
[13:00:39] <yamahaalex37> any amount of code*
[13:02:55] <Nuno147> anyone aware of a bug in django webserver ? the issue I am facing is that it direct images from a css while using "img/a.png" for example while adding the css file ?
[13:04:45] <aaronmcadam> what Nuno147??
[13:11:29] <AfroTurf> can i get the class attributes of an object?
[13:11:42] <aaronmcadam> what?
[13:12:22] <AfroTurf> .class { position:"relative" } $(".class").position...
[13:12:36] <aaronmcadam> ?css @ AfroTurf
[13:12:37] <bot-t> AfroTurf, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[13:12:42] <AfroTurf> ah ya duh
[13:12:45] <AfroTurf> thx
[13:12:47] <aaronmcadam> np
[13:12:54] <aaronmcadam> not sure if u can return a property list tho
[13:12:56] <aaronmcadam> that would be handy
[13:13:06] <AfroTurf> ya that would be :)
[13:13:29] <mathi> I get the following error: "window is not defined"
[13:13:38] <mathi> importScripts('/public/scripts/jquery/jquery-1.7.1.min.js');
[13:13:40] <aaronmcadam> well done :D
[13:13:47] <mathi> trying to import jquery library in a web worker
[13:14:05] <mathi> can anyone help?
[13:14:48] <aaronmcadam> maybe workers don't have access
[13:14:56] <aaronmcadam> and anyway, why are u trying to do that?
[13:15:18] <mathi> because I want to use the power of jquery for the code in my web worker
[13:15:21] <aaronmcadam> I thought web workers were only for pushing messages
[13:15:44] <mathi> they do processing in parallel
[13:15:48] <mathi> could be anything
[13:16:31] <aaronmcadam> I mean I thought they were sandboxed
[13:16:35] <aaronmcadam> for security
[13:16:44] <aaronmcadam> maybe that's why window isn't available
[13:17:34] <mathi> so jquery uses the window object just by importing the library?
[13:17:53] <aaronmcadam> uhm you can't add a variable without it
[13:17:54] <aaronmcadam> a global
[13:18:04] <aaronmcadam> jQuery = window.jQuery
[13:18:11] <aaronmcadam> and also they add a unique object too
[13:19:05] <mathi> :-(
[13:19:15] <aaronmcadam> if(typeof importScripts == "function") {
[13:19:15] <aaronmcadam> / web worker scope
[13:19:15] <aaronmcadam> }
[13:19:15] <aaronmcadam> else {
[13:19:15] <aaronmcadam> / not web worker scope, assume window scope
[13:19:15] <aaronmcadam> }
[13:19:23] <aaronmcadam> if(typeof window != "undefined") {
[13:19:23] <aaronmcadam> / window scope
[13:19:23] <aaronmcadam> }
[13:19:23] <aaronmcadam> else {
[13:19:25] <aaronmcadam> / not window scope, assume web worker scope
[13:19:27] <aaronmcadam> }
[13:19:29] <aaronmcadam> see
[13:19:33] <aaronmcadam> http://erikvold.com/blog/index.cfm/2010/4/27/using-web-workers-today
[13:19:50] <aaronmcadam> so workers don't have access to window
[13:19:54] <aaronmcadam> and with good reason
[13:20:25] <mathi> yea I know...
[13:20:31] <mathi> my UI blocks from time to time
[13:20:44] <mathi> and I was hoping to delegate some work to web workers
[13:20:52] <mathi> now the hope has gone(
[13:21:02] <aaronmcadam> why don't u pass the processing with jq to it
[13:21:34] <mathi> you mean, to give a jquery object to the worker?
[13:22:09] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[13:22:14] <aaronmcadam> look at this post on require.js
[13:22:19] <aaronmcadam> http://groups.google.com/group/requirejs/browse_thread/thread/618bbb0deacf34e0
[13:23:19] <aaronmcadam> could try zepto or something else
[13:23:31] <aaronmcadam> or just use *shock* native js
[13:24:58] <mathi> all I want to delegate for now is this: var elements = $(data).children('.cacheData');
[13:25:16] <mathi> so the idea was to return a jquery object, so I want to do jquery not native
[13:25:24] <aaronmcadam> why don't you extract that function then
[13:25:36] <aaronmcadam> did u look at that post
[13:25:51] <mathi> he last post? yes, but I don't understand the solution for me
[13:25:53] <aaronmcadam> i don't think workers are for what you're trying to do
[13:26:04] <aaronmcadam> could use require to pull in jq maybe
[13:26:16] <mathi> aa, I got you now
[13:26:17] <mathi> maybe
[13:26:32] <aaronmcadam> but I don't think workers are for ur use case
[13:28:46] <aaronmcadam> but could look at https://github.com/h5bp/mothereffinganimatedgif
[13:28:58] <aaronmcadam> they're talking about using workers there
[13:29:20] <synchrone> wait, GIF is copyrighted
[13:29:23] <synchrone> isn't it ?
[13:29:46] <aaronmcadam> wtf??
[13:30:07] <aaronmcadam> how is that relevant?
[13:30:41] <kristofer91> Hey, which effect would you use if i want to have a div, half visible, and when hovered it shows fully ?
[13:31:04] <aaronmcadam> ?slideDown @ kristofer91
[13:31:05] <bot-t> kristofer91, .slideDown([duration], [callback]): Display the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
[13:31:08] <nervdude6> fade?
[13:31:35] <kristofer91> i want it to slide up :P
[13:31:43] <mathi> aaron strange, can't find the worker.js file  https://github.com/h5bp/mothereffinganimatedgif/tree/master/assets/js
[13:31:51] <aaronmcadam> haha yeah
[13:31:59] <aaronmcadam> can't find it myself
[13:33:04] <kristofer91> i'm not supposed to post here maybe but anyways just gonna ask a little question,
[13:33:20] <kristofer91> i have a flash website's that was done a while ago, but i dont work with flash.
[13:33:26] <nervdude6> guys, i'm loading a list of forms in a div via ajax and need to submit each of those via ajax, problem is with document ready....
[13:33:38] <kristofer91> Wondering how i can edit it or with what, so that i can use all the elements that was used in it
[13:33:52] <aaronmcadam> you're fucked
[13:33:55] <kristofer91> -.-
[13:33:55] <nervdude6> me?
[13:33:57] <nervdude6> :))))
[13:34:07] <aaronmcadam> kristofer91: you're fucked
[13:34:12] <nervdude6> phew
[13:34:14] <kristofer91> haha
[13:34:16] <nervdude6> :P
[13:34:22] <aaronmcadam> nervdude6: you're probably wrong
[13:34:25] <kristofer91> once a flash website is compiled no turning back :P ?
[13:34:29] <aaronmcadam> uhuh
[13:34:35] <aaronmcadam> unless u have the source files
[13:34:39] <aaronmcadam> and know actionscript
[13:34:46] <kristofer91> ok so im fucked
[13:34:48] <aaronmcadam> and have Flash
[13:34:55] <aaronmcadam> yep
[13:34:55] <kristofer91> i have the files from the ftp
[13:35:03] <aaronmcadam> are they .swf?
[13:35:08] <kristofer91> yeah
[13:35:11] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[13:35:15] <aaronmcadam> that's compiled
[13:35:20] <aaronmcadam> you'll need .fla bullshit
[13:35:20] <kristofer91> how about .dat :P
[13:35:24] <kristofer91> let me check
[13:35:38] <nervdude6> aaronmcadam: can you poin me in the right dirrection please (i used $(document).bind("ready", function() { and the trigger the "ready", but strange things are happening)
[13:35:52] <aaronmcadam> wtf?
[13:36:04] <aaronmcadam> binding and triggering?
[13:36:11] <aaronmcadam> ?g You're doing it wrong
[13:36:12] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, DOING IT WRONG - http://www.doingitwrong.com/
[13:36:15] <nervdude6> kristofer91: search for some flash decompiler (swf decompiler)
[13:36:32] <aaronmcadam> those things have gotta be shit
[13:36:42] <nervdude6> kristofer91: some things are still editable, but don't expect too much (scaling up the app i mean)
[13:36:48] <kristofer91> no no
[13:36:51] <kristofer91> i only need the images
[13:36:53] <kristofer91> etc
[13:36:57] <kristofer91> im converting the site to wordpress
[13:37:31] <nervdude6> a swf decompiler will do the trick for that ;)
[13:37:40] <aaronmcadam> why not screen grab them then
[13:37:47] <nervdude6> eww
[13:37:49] <kristofer91> for quality's sake i guess
[13:37:49] <aaronmcadam> lol
[13:37:52] <aaronmcadam> ye
[13:38:05] <kristofer91> also the content
[13:38:08] <kristofer91> alot of text there
[13:38:09] <kristofer91> that can't be copied
[13:38:11] <kristofer91> need that too
[13:38:22] <nervdude6> decompile it
[13:38:36] <nervdude6> www.lmgtfy.com/?q=swf+decompiler
[13:38:43] <kristofer91> thanks
[13:38:46] <nervdude6> yw
[13:38:47] <kristofer91> haha
[13:39:27] <nervdude6> doing it wrong website is a killer, thanks :)
[13:39:56] <aaronmcadam> sure is
[13:40:06] <nervdude6> aaronmcadam: how can i send the loaded forms wia ajax again?
[13:41:06] <nervdude6> i googled it and found the bind/trigger sollution from 2008 that would do the trick
[13:41:28] <aaronmcadam> i don't get why you're doing it
[13:41:32] <nervdude6> thing is... it kinda does, but the ready thing executes the code over and over again...
[13:41:42] <aaronmcadam> obviously
[13:41:52] <aaronmcadam> what exactly are u trying to do
[13:42:21] <kristofer91> niice, downloaded a free swf decompiler, editor
[13:42:25] <kristofer91> exactly what i needed :D
[13:42:32] <nervdude6> i have a search form, i send via ajax the q and get the results in a div, each result has a form, i need to submit each of those forms via ajax too...
[13:43:03] <nervdude6> gg kristofer91 :)
[13:43:06] <aaronmcadam> ok
[13:43:18] <aaronmcadam> use delegate on the submit events
[13:43:23] <aaronmcadam> classify the forms in the results
[13:43:25] <nervdude6> come again?
[13:43:33] <aaronmcadam> ?jqfundamentals @ nervdude6
[13:43:34] <bot-t> nervdude6, jQuery Fundamentals - http://jqfundamentals.com/
[13:43:36] <nervdude6> shoulda said i'm a newb in jq
[13:43:38] <ghankstef> nervdude6: .ajax?
[13:43:48] <aaronmcadam> read that nervdude6
[13:43:52] <nervdude6> k
[13:43:59] <ghankstef> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:44:23] <aaronmcadam> he's got that i think
[13:44:30] <aaronmcadam> it's the event delegation he'll need to grok
[13:44:46] <nervdude6> ?
[13:45:02] <aaronmcadam> read jqfundamentals first and come back
[13:45:27] <nervdude6> kinda in a hurry but wth
[13:45:39] <aaronmcadam> u won't get anywhere hurrying
[13:46:58] <nervdude6> i need to not get f*kd now, but yes, you're right about that
[13:47:50] <nervdude6> i have jq.min.js do i need more for this?
[13:47:51] <ghankstef> so her eis something that is making  me stratch my head  -  I am building  a sort of ajax inline commenting system   - a basic version  of what  facebook does.  To allow posting I have a add comment link which retrieves thnot sure how to trobuleshoot this e proper  html form  via  json .  If I append the form to the body of the page -  its fine  but if I put it where I need it to go in the DOM,   the key textarea field is missing -
[13:48:02] <ghankstef> not sure how to troubleshoot this
[13:48:48] <espressive> curious question :: is there something like npm for jQuery and even JavaScript?
[13:49:10] <aaronmcadam> espressive: well there is bpm
[13:49:18] <aaronmcadam> but we're trying to get some movement on that
[13:49:22] <aaronmcadam> else try ender
[13:50:40] <aaronmcadam> espressive: https://github.com/paulirish/lazyweb-requests/issues/49
[13:52:21] <aaronmcadam> https://github.com/bpm/getbpm.org
[13:52:30] <aaronmcadam> http://getbpm.org/
[13:54:24] <espressive> aaronmcadam: thanks this seems to be the current implementation : https://github.com/bpm/bpm
[13:54:40] <aaronmcadam> Ender has more weight behind it
[13:54:45] <aaronmcadam> bpm is a dead project
[13:54:57] <aaronmcadam> but we're trying to get it going again with  the lazyweb stuff
[13:55:29] <aaronmcadam> http://ender.no.de/
[13:58:23] <espressive> aaronmcadam: things is we need to work for one that does one thing awesome. Seems like these want to also solve a css issues
[13:58:52] <espressive> and others
[13:59:03] <aaronmcadam> wtf?
[13:59:21] <aaronmcadam> it's just a package manager
[13:59:47] <nervdude6> TYVM aaronmcadam !
[13:59:58] <aaronmcadam> uhm ok?
[14:00:09] <espressive> aaronmcadam: true but still
[14:00:18] <aaronmcadam> huh what still
[14:00:27] <nervdude6> it was killing me for 2 days, that did the trick :)
[14:00:29] <aaronmcadam> it's not uncommon for js helper libs for css
[14:00:36] <aaronmcadam> altho I don't like to mix
[14:00:45] <nervdude6> I'm having id's for each form instead of class...
[14:00:55] <aaronmcadam> use a class
[14:01:11] <nervdude6> why?
[14:01:14] <aaronmcadam> with the event delegation flavour of see ?on @ nervdude6
[14:01:14] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[14:01:33] <aaronmcadam> because that's the way to do it
[14:01:43] <aaronmcadam> if you've got a *class* of elements, which u do
[14:01:46] <nervdude6> ok, thanx
[14:01:55] <aaronmcadam> don't select them with ids, you use a class
[14:02:13] <aaronmcadam> do u do any other programming?
[14:02:29] <nervdude6> thing is, forms will be different, each one load extra data...
[14:02:36] <espressive> aaronmcadam: focusing on one thing generaly results in a overall better solution. One can still support the others but the focus should be JS
[14:02:58] <aaronmcadam> what are u talking about
[14:03:04] <nervdude6> php is my flavour, i kinda hated js till i found i can't do anything without it ...
[14:03:28] <aaronmcadam> haha php right
[14:03:47] <espressive> aaronmcadam:so what is npm? a node package manager right?
[14:03:54] <aaronmcadam> right
[14:04:08] <aaronmcadam> a package is a package
[14:04:17] <nervdude6> aaronmcadam: ? u no like php :) ?
[14:04:21] <aaronmcadam> haha who does
[14:04:24] <espressive> do they also support general
[14:04:26] <aaronmcadam> it's object model is bullshit
[14:04:31] <espressive> js
[14:04:39] <aaronmcadam> espressive: I think you're confused
[14:04:50] <espressive> I might be
[14:04:54] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[14:04:55] <nervdude6> who cares, i can code fast in it and it's the most expanded web tech
[14:04:57] <espressive> please correct me
[14:05:00] <aaronmcadam> who cares?
[14:05:01] <aaronmcadam> lol
[14:05:17] <aaronmcadam> OO is one of the most important things to learn about programming
[14:05:26] <aaronmcadam> espressive: a package can be anything
[14:05:28] <nervdude6> besides that..
[14:05:39] <aaronmcadam> besides the fundamental principles?
[14:05:40] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[14:05:40] <espressive> of course
[14:05:41] <nervdude6> you cand argue it's the most used
[14:05:43] <nervdude6> :))))))))))
[14:05:50] <aaronmcadam> it's definately losing share
[14:05:57] <aaronmcadam> s/a/i
[14:06:07] <nervdude6> so is Internet Exploder
[14:06:08] <aaronmcadam> it's cuz it's the hobbyist's language
[14:06:10] <nervdude6> err.. exp[lorer
[14:06:46] <aaronmcadam> espressive: some libs are also available on node, because they're not dom-specific
[14:06:55] <aaronmcadam> backbone, underscore
[14:06:59] <aaronmcadam> for example
[14:08:03] <espressive> aaronmcadam: I get that, so what do you think would be a good npm for client side js?
[14:08:20] <aaronmcadam> ender looks alright
[14:08:25] <aaronmcadam> I've already said bpn
[14:08:28] <aaronmcadam> bpm*
[14:08:32] <aaronmcadam> I'm not using either tho
[14:09:07] <espressive> ok point made
[14:09:10] <espressive> thx
[14:09:12] <aaronmcadam> also you'll have to us AMD too
[14:09:17] <aaronmcadam> require.js
[14:09:25] <espressive> sure
[14:09:29] <aaronmcadam> because you'd need CommonJS packages
[14:09:36] <aaronmcadam> which is good
[14:09:37] <espressive> yep
[14:09:49] <aaronmcadam> it'll hopefully force some people into code organisation
[14:10:30] <espressive> teach is probablt better than force ;)
[14:10:38] <espressive> probably
[14:11:10] <aaronmcadam> no, we need to force :P

[15:14:28] <imsky> you found out jqui sucks too, huh
[15:14:30] <abjorn> Well, the real problem is my boss has us using jQuery UI dialog boxes for something it's very clearly not meant for

[16:20:39] <guy> I have an element containing a lot of <p> children

[16:21:10] <Eviltwin> $("#parent p:gt(9)").remove()
[16:21:45] <Eviltwin> Or maybe $("#parent > p:gt(9)").remove() to be safe
[16:23:01] <nervdude6> hi guys, how do i append text to some input? (w/o this.val()+'new text')
[16:23:19] <dabear> nervdude6: why not .val?
[16:23:40] <nervdude6> i want to append text
[16:24:00] <nervdude6> asking if there's an option to do that other than: oldval+newtext
[16:24:18] <dabear> what different behavior do you want?
[16:24:32] <dabear> this.value += "newtext"
[16:24:42] <nervdude6> somethink like
[16:24:43] <dabear> assuming "this" is a dom element
[16:24:44] <nervdude6> :)
[16:24:51] <nervdude6> input element
[16:26:31] <nervdude6> i have: $(this).parent().find(":input[name=question]").val('?');
[16:27:04] <nervdude6> don't want to carry all that in the val() just to add the questionmark
[16:27:23] <Eviltwin> $(this).parent().find(":input[name=question]").each(function(){this.value+="?"});
[16:27:43] <nervdude6> hmm
[16:27:45] <nervdude6> nicer
[16:28:22] <nervdude6> possible without each? i only have one input element name=question
[16:28:48] <Eviltwin> You know that each still works even if you have only one, right?
[16:28:50] <Eviltwin> Or even if you have zero
[16:28:55] <Eviltwin> It's a safety check
[16:29:09] <Eviltwin> Makes sure that all of the matches (even if it's just one or even zero)
[16:29:11] <Eviltwin> Get updated
[16:29:15] <nervdude6> yes, but when scaling up.. i'll gonna be a lot of load
[16:29:23] <Eviltwin> What?
[16:30:10] <nervdude6> to use the each function and a function inside that, just for something (that should be simpler?)
[16:30:40] <Eviltwin> I'm unable to parse meaning from that sentence
[16:31:28] <Eviltwin> If your question is about performance
[16:31:32] <nervdude6> yes
[16:31:35] <nervdude6> performance
[16:31:37] <Eviltwin> And this line is actually a performance issue for you
[16:31:41] <Eviltwin> You've done something horribly wrong
[16:32:00] <nervdude6> ok, so i was saying that there are too many instructions in your sollution
[16:32:10] <Eviltwin> There are too many instructions?
[16:32:18] <Eviltwin> Are you running this on a microcontroller or something?
[16:32:32] <nervdude6> this is why i came here in the first place
[16:32:34] <Eviltwin> Only a kew KB for a text segment
[16:32:47] <nervdude6> i have loads of data
[16:33:14] <nervdude6> that statement is in a loop
[16:34:14] <Eviltwin> The difference between doing it without the each and doing it with the each is effectively the difference between (function() { value += "?" })() and value += "?"
[16:34:21] <Eviltwin> Is that one frame is actually causing a performance issue for you
[16:34:38] <Eviltwin> You need to seriously reevaluate your code
[16:35:14] <nervdude6> ok, thanks
[16:36:16] <guy> Eviltwin: Thanks.
[16:45:39] <standoo1> anyone know of a dropdown menu for jquery ui?
[16:49:25] <ndss56> standoo: no, but i made a custom one.
[16:54:02] <standoo> can i have a look?
[16:54:18] <ndss56> standoo: yes
[16:54:30] <ndss56> standoo: but be aware it doesn't work properly

[17:29:13] <nervdude6> anyway to sleep() ?
[17:35:32] <xec-> nervdude6: what are you trying to do? (no there is no sleep)
[17:36:40] <nervdude6> prototyping, needed to sleep for testing, nvm, solved
[17:36:47] <Eviltwin> nervdude6: Look into setTimeout
[17:36:57] <nervdude6> also need to sleep, cofee isn't cutting it anymore
[18:03:20] <sss> HELP ME PLZ == XXXOOO : ?
[18:06:17] <nervdude6> sss: ask THE question
[18:07:14] <nervdude6> @anyone: is there an event that triggers when the element is rendered by the browser?
[18:08:58] <who_am_i> hello
[18:09:06] <nervdude6> hi
[18:09:30] <who_am_i> I'm using .resizable on an object, and I'd like to specify div as a handle...if that makes any sense ;)
[18:09:49] <who_am_i> hm, let me jsfiddle that to be clear
[18:15:59] <who_am_i> http://jsfiddle.net/ZLgbN/1/
[18:16:12] <who_am_i> I'd like to be able to start resizing anywhere in the "handle" div
[18:18:59] <nervdude6> maybe somebody else might help you with mootools...
[18:21:11] <LekeFly> Anyone that could help me get this updated on a ajax reload? $("form.jqtransform").jqTransform();
[18:21:52] <who_am_i> okay, that was easy :) .ui-resizable-s { height: 200px;Â }
[18:27:21] <black_warlock> who can explain the function of permalinks ?
[18:28:00] <Eviltwin> Uh...what?
[18:29:39] <Eviltwin> Like what a permalink is? why they exist? or what?
[18:32:24] <who_am_i> â/join #css
[18:32:27] <who_am_i> oops :)
[18:33:02] <nervdude6> black_warlock: permalinks as in Permanent Links?
[18:33:12] <Eviltwin> nervdude6: That's where the term comes from, yes
[18:34:11] <nervdude6> yup, pointing it out
[18:34:40] <movvy> hello
[18:34:52] <movvy> so I used jquery to make a popup form that uses body.append
[18:35:04] <movvy> it works that popup has a form in it and a submit button
[18:35:15] <movvy> I need to interupt that... which i would normally do as .ready
[18:35:22] <movvy> but i can't do that because its not on the page originally
[18:35:28] <movvy> thoughts? solutions?
[18:36:27] <Eviltwin> movvy: For the same code that does the append, right after, add the listeners
[18:36:46] <nervdude6> Eviltwin: you know of an event that triggers when the element is rendered by the browser?
[18:37:06] <Eviltwin> $("body").append("<div id='foo'>...</div>"); $("#foo").bind("submit", function() { ... })
[18:37:19] <Eviltwin> nervdude6: I know there isn't one that's standard and that it's considered a very bad idea
[18:37:42] <nervdude6> ok... what should i use? mouseenter?
[18:38:06] <Eviltwin> If that's the event you're interested in
[18:38:54] <Eviltwin> Everything that happens in the browser is either caused by a user action, caused by something in the browser's engine, or caused by the JavaScript code you have
[18:39:05] <Eviltwin> User actions and most of the browser engine things have events
[18:39:13] <Eviltwin> Because you wouldn't have any other way to get that information
[18:39:22] <Eviltwin> But things like an event for adding an element to the DOM
[18:39:31] <Eviltwin> Why should there be an event for that if it's going to be done by JavaScript?
[18:39:49] <Eviltwin> The code that adds it should be responsible for communicating that
[18:39:58] <movvy> is #foo the form or the button itself
[18:40:42] <Eviltwin> For the submit it event it would have to be the form
[18:40:48] <Eviltwin> For a click event, it would probably be the button
[18:41:19] <movvy> excellent thats what I thought, giving it a try now! :)
[18:44:18] <nervdude6> how do i undelegate this: $('#biglist').delegate('tr', 'mouseenter', function() {
[18:44:20] <nervdude6> ?
[18:44:53] <Eviltwin> nervdude6: see ?undelegate
[18:44:53] <bot-t> nervdude6, .undelegate(): Remove a handler from the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/undelegate/
[18:45:34] <nervdude6> i saw it... can't figure it out how to undelegate it...
[18:46:05] <Eviltwin> What part aren't you understanding?
[18:46:10] <nervdude6> undelegate('tr', 'mouseenter'); doesn't work
[18:47:15] <movvy> Eviltwin that worked, now i need to understand why a callback function within that bind is not getting called
[18:49:08] <Eviltwin> nervdude6: http://jsfiddle.net/rXpZt/
[18:49:10] <movvy> alright its gettingv called but not displaying the errors

[19:24:21] <Vali> hi, quick question: I have: <input id='test' value='food' />  and after I call: $('#test').focus(); I cannot type in that textbox, any ideas why?
[19:24:43] <markmarkoh> Vali:  set a type="text" ?
[19:25:06] <Vali> yes
[19:25:35] <Vali> is there some bug about it that I don't know off?
[19:26:20] <Vali> even if i click it (while it has the focus) i cannot type, but if i focus something else and then back I can type
[19:32:36] <looopy> is anyone here familiar with masonry?
[19:32:58] <markmarkoh> Vali:  can you reproduce in another browser?
[19:34:06] <Vali> works in chrome, does not in firefox

[20:24:34] <kborchers> There is a file upload example
[20:24:39] <cliffordmeece> I have a query ui draggable and I ant to drop it on a div.  The droppable needs to be able to accept only certain draggable divs, but the criterion for accepting the div is not on the actual div element that is being dragged, but on a class on one of the child div's of the draggable element.  How would I write the selector on the 'accept' option of the droppable for this case?

[20:28:39] <LukeNukem> ooh
[20:28:40] <LukeNukem> i see it
[20:29:16] <cliffordmeece> :has works perfectly, thanks.
[20:34:39] <LukeNukem> kborchers, i need a bit more help, my processing php script has javascript popup output on success

[20:34:45] <LukeNukem> how can i do this
[21:04:53] <LukeNukem> does anyone know how i can grab an element based on its rel attribute
[21:05:02] <LukeNukem> like <a href='' rel='myrel'
[21:06:41] <atula> LukeNukem: $('[rel="myrel"]') usually does it for me... take look at the docs it has a lot more info on things like attribute begins with... endswith etc.
[21:08:03] <Chani> hmmmm.
[21:08:47] <Chani> scrollTop will scroll to x pixels - but I have my pisition as a fraction. what'll give me the height of the whole page in pixels, then?
[21:09:36] <Chani> oh, looks like .height exists...
[21:11:47] <Chani> hrm. I want $(document).height but hten according to the internet, the most reliable way of scrolling the whole page is $(window).scrollTop...
[21:13:23] <Chani> crap, I forgotr how to do debug output again
[21:15:17] <Chani> crap., it's not scrolling :(

[21:30:33] <LukeNukem> can someone help me with jquery form
[21:30:53] <Chani> ahh. 2017. :/
[21:31:01] <Chani> 5 more years of audio silliness
[21:31:08] <LukeNukem> Chani, can you ?
[21:31:18] <Chani> LukeNukem: don't ask to ask, just ask :)
[21:31:26] <LukeNukem> :)
[21:32:05] <LukeNukem> so im using jquery form to upload files ajax style, it works clean and simple but one problem i have is, php outputs some text or javascript popups if any error occurs or maybe a success message(upload finished / unknown image format )
[21:32:09] <LukeNukem> these are not being shown
[21:32:15] <LukeNukem> how can i make these be shown?
[21:32:32] <Jarred> What might not cause this to not work as intended?   $('.project').bind 'mouseover', ->
[21:32:33] <Jarred>     $("#current_project").addClass('hover') (It's CoffeeScript)
[21:33:17] <Eviltwin> LukeNukem: I'd have to see more about how you've implemented the upload
[21:33:24] <LukeNukem> view source?
[21:33:28] <LukeNukem> shall i pasetbin that
[21:33:32] <Eviltwin> I suppose
[21:33:38] <Eviltwin> No promises on actually reading it if it's long though
[21:34:08] <Eviltwin> Jarred: I don't like reading CoffeeScript, it hides what's really running
[21:34:16] <Eviltwin> Jarred: Please convert it to JavaScript if you want me to help you
[21:35:16] <LukeNukem> http://pastebin.com/28wia0DB
[21:35:39] <LukeNukem> line 84 to
[21:35:48] <Eviltwin> And what's toastmessage?
[21:35:59] <LukeNukem> its a js plugin.
[21:36:20] <LukeNukem> line 84 to 106
[21:36:27] <Eviltwin> Okay
[21:36:38] <Eviltwin> So you say JavaScript is coming back in that data
[21:36:42] <LukeNukem> yes
[21:36:42] <Eviltwin> And you want that JavaScript to execute?
[21:36:59] <Jarred> Eviltwin: https://gist.github.com/f43782790e0890818ff7
[21:37:00] <LukeNukem> yes
[21:37:02] <LukeNukem> see line 128
[21:37:08] <LukeNukem> thats the ajax form code
[21:37:29] <Jarred> Eviltwin: The lines that don't appear to do anything are lines 5 and 8
[21:37:39] <Jarred> Eviltwin: Both #current_project and .project exist
[21:38:20] <Eviltwin> You appear to be binding these inside another click handler
[21:38:26] <Eviltwin> I'm guessing that's not what you want
[21:38:36] <Jarred> ohhh
[21:38:52] <Eviltwin> See why reading the JavaScript can be helpful? :P
[21:39:09] <Eviltwin> CoffeeScript makes it easy to accidentally put something where it doesn't belong
[21:39:18] <Eviltwin> Or accidentally return something you didn't mean to
[21:40:10] <Eviltwin> LukeNukem: I don't use ajaxForm but my guess would be your form submit handler and theirs are fighting
[21:40:51] <GoSox> i'm trying to set up a system where several different items are checked to see if they are visible, and if they are, they are hidden via slideUp() animation, one at a time, and then once that's all done, new content is loaded and displayed via slideDown() animation
[21:41:18] <GoSox> the PROBLEM is that there are so many nested if {} else {}
[21:41:23] <Eviltwin> GoSox: You may want to look at Deferreds
[21:41:43] <jrockjiggz> GoSox, or use a recursive function
[21:53:08] <Eviltwin> GoSox: http://jsfiddle.net/77EUH/
[21:55:51] <LukeNukem> Eviltwin, i dont understand
[21:56:10] <LukeNukem> what do you mean by my submit handler
[21:56:45] <LukeNukem> $('form[name=update_stuff]').on("submit", function(e){ ?
[22:09:25] <LukeNukem> Eviltwin, you there
[22:09:48] <Eviltwin> LukeNukem: Busy at the moment, sorry
[22:10:14] <LukeNukem> well i found how to do it, but i just can understand it.
[22:10:19] <LukeNukem> you could maybe tell me, it seems fairly easy.
[22:10:25] <LukeNukem> http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#options-object
[22:10:31] <LukeNukem> the success call ba
[22:10:33] <LukeNukem> back*
[22:12:13] <cm3> hello
[22:15:29] <GoSox> so the speed setting on slideUp and slideDown is based on the time. Which means that a tall item will 'move' much faster than a short item, so that both animations take the same slideDown(time)
[22:15:40] <GoSox> is there a way to specify a set speed
[22:16:04] <GoSox> speed as in how fast an object actually moves
[22:17:19] <Eviltwin> GoSox: Set the time as a constant times the .height()
[22:17:48] <GoSox> isn't there some issue with .height() where it won't give you the height of certain kinds of objects?
[22:17:55] <GoSox> i think i had an issue like that a few weeks back
[22:18:01] <LukeNukem> Eviltwin, WOOOHOOO IT WORKED :::::::::::::::::::::D
[22:18:06] <Eviltwin> It won't give you the height of hidden objects
[22:18:09] <Eviltwin> LukeNukem: Congrats
[22:18:10] <GoSox> LukeNukem just drew an ascii penis
[22:18:26] <LukeNukem> GoSox, its not a penis without a B
[22:18:38] <LukeNukem> ascii penis would be B===================D
[22:18:39] <Eviltwin> Maybe a heavily studded penis
[22:18:42] <GoSox> its part of a penis, hopefully the rest is off screen and not removed
[22:18:49] <LukeNukem> ^
[22:19:05] <Eviltwin> A ribbed penis
[22:19:20] <GoSox> ribbed, for her mouth's pleasure
[22:19:22] <GoSox> :O
[22:19:47] <GoSox> anyway, Eviltwin, i ended up just changing how my animation works slightly so my ifs aren't nested
[22:19:50] <LukeNukem> why are we talking about penis :|
[22:19:54] <GoSox> its probably less code this way
[22:20:07] <Eviltwin> Up to you
[22:21:30] <GoSox> how does this code look, aesthetically? http://pastebin.com/fZi8mBSR
[22:21:32] <LukeNukem> Eviltwin, if you are back, i need a tiny bit of help
[22:21:34] <GoSox> i know, that's an odd question
[22:21:45] <LukeNukem> i mean, if you are not busy
[22:22:12] <Eviltwin> LukeNukem: I'm constantly in and out and the amount of concentration I'm able to devote is always fluctuating
[22:22:29] <Eviltwin> Just ask the question and if I can't help, maybe someone else can
[22:22:36] <LukeNukem> okay :)
[22:22:45] <LukeNukem> on success callback, i want the page to reload using ajax.
[22:22:54] <LukeNukem> but if i do this, then the server output is not shown
[22:23:18] <LukeNukem> so do i do the ajax reload within the server script?
[22:23:19] <Eviltwin> GoSox: Looks like there's a decent bit of redundant code there
[22:23:34] <Eviltwin> LukeNukem: AJAX reload within the server script?
[22:23:40] <Eviltwin> I'm not quite sure I follow what you mean by that
[22:23:53] <LukeNukem> after i call the javascript function to show the success message
[22:24:01] <LukeNukem> after its closed, i could do an ajax page reload
[22:24:06] <Eviltwin> GoSox: Not redundant but repeated
[22:24:45] <GoSox> there is repetition between the two .on("click")'s, but there's only going to be two, so it doesn't seem prudent to put each of those snippets into it's own little function
[22:24:49] <ckknight> GoSox: ick, I'm not fond of that indentation style
[22:25:01] <GoSox> ckknight: thats the only indentation style my brain can read
[22:25:13] <GoSox> i find traditional style way too confusing
[22:25:14] <Eviltwin> ckknight: I've seen a lot worse
[22:25:21] <ckknight> Eviltwin: I'm sure.
[22:25:57] <GoSox> this code is functioning great! I'm just annoyed that i can't working on the actual coloring of these items, because the monitor i'm using as impressively bad color accuracy
[22:26:07] <Eviltwin> GoSox: If the actual elements aren't being replaced
[22:26:14] <Eviltwin> I'd suggest caching all of these elements up at the top
[22:26:28] <GoSox> all elements are dynamically loaded via php
[22:26:32] <Eviltwin> Like var filter = $("#filter_col"), rest = $("#rest_col"), city = $("#city_col");
[22:26:42] <Eviltwin> So once this code runs
[22:26:47] <Eviltwin> Those three elements get replaced?
[22:27:02] <GoSox> oh wait....
[22:27:18] <GoSox> oh i see what you mean
[22:27:42] <GoSox> is there a performance benefit to that? because the way i do it is going to make it easier for me to make changes years from now
[22:27:43] <Eviltwin> It would be more efficient and probably look better to reduce unnecessarily repeated selectors
[22:27:44] <GoSox> (i hope)
[22:28:08] <Eviltwin> Well let's say that you decide to call it #filter_col2 instead or something
[22:28:17] <Eviltwin> Wouldn't you rather only have to update that one place?
[22:28:41] <GoSox> realistically, it's insignificant to use search & replace in those situations
[22:28:52] <GoSox> i mean i see what you're saying
[22:29:02] <GoSox> but for now i'd rather leave that part verbose
[22:29:25] <Eviltwin> w/e
[22:29:33] <Eviltwin> Not a page I'm ever going to :P
[22:29:38] <GoSox> whatEVAAAAA imma do what i waaaaaaant
[22:29:52] <GoSox> you don't even know what page it is!
[22:29:53] <GoSox> do you?
[22:30:08] <Eviltwin> Or DO I?
[22:30:52] <GoSox> i don't think i've ever used jQuery on this site before, soooo i'm thinking you may not
[22:31:10] <GoSox> unless we've talked in another channel
[22:31:28] <Eviltwin> Were you the same GoSox who used to be in #macnn on Hashmark?
[22:31:58] <GoSox> i the same l008com on macnn, i don't know if i ever used GoSox in there
[22:32:04] <GoSox> but i've never seen another GoSox so I must be
[22:32:21] <GoSox> are you an admin on the macnn forums?
[22:32:31] <Eviltwin> Naw, just their IRC
[22:32:34] <GoSox> oh
[22:33:05] <GoSox> i was on the 10.8 thread yesterday and i got this crazy slow animated floating ad that slid across my screen then parked right in the middle of the page
[22:33:15] <GoSox> i was like "WTF IS THIS!"
[22:33:21] <GoSox> i hate forums that go ad-whore crazy
[22:34:18] <meghdad> anyone know how can i attach jquery plugins to elements?
[22:34:21] <GoSox> Eviltwin: you in/near Yonkers?
[22:34:31] <GoSox> if so, you could use MenuLizard, if you sent me some local menus :D
[22:35:04] <Eviltwin> Is that what you're working on?
[22:35:07] <meghdad> i see datetimepicker is using this line  $t.datepicker($.timepicker._newInst($t, o)._defaults);
[22:35:14] <GoSox> yeah, what did you think i was working on?
[22:35:15] <meghdad> $t is an element
[22:35:40] <Eviltwin> I hope you're not the one behind the 2-star App Store app :P
[22:35:45] <GoSox> i am
[22:35:47] <meghdad> but i can't see anything before this line that attaches the datepicker to that element
[22:35:54] <GoSox> but there's a reason the app has two stars
[22:36:01] <meghdad> is that automated in the core code somehow?
[22:36:10] <Eviltwin> Most apps have lower ratings than they should IMO
[22:36:11] <GoSox> people who are not users of the website find the app through the app store, and give it 1 star because there are no menus near them
[22:36:26] <Eviltwin> Partially because there was a while where Apple was prompting for number of stars when deleting an app
[22:36:34] <GoSox> the app itself kicks ass, but if i don't have local menus for you in my database, you aren't going to like it
[22:36:39] <Eviltwin> So when you were sick enough of an app to delete it, then they wanted your input
[22:37:10] <GoSox> the app for whatsmyip.org has better rankings
[22:37:36] <GoSox> it was a 5 star app for a while, but it crashes on OS 5 on iPads and that has taken down it's ratings. And I no longer have an iOS dev so that's probably not going to change any time soon
[22:37:38] <Eviltwin> meghdad: They use the widget factory which works via $element.widgetName({...})
[22:37:49] <Eviltwin> To create a new instance that is then bound to the element
[22:41:51] <mehrdad> ok so it is bound in place
[22:42:28] <Eviltwin> mehrdad: see ?g ajpiano widget factory
[22:42:30] <bot-t> mehrdad, jQuery UI Widget Factory - http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/
[22:42:31] <Eviltwin> If you want to know how it works
[22:45:26] <LukeNukem> dont help mehrdad
[22:45:26] <LukeNukem> :D
[22:46:19] <Eviltwin> LukeNukem: His doesn't require me learning a plugin I don't already know
[22:47:47] <LukeNukem> i was just kidding, geez.
[22:48:14] <LukeNukem> T_T
[22:48:36] <mehrdad> LukeNukem, u little punk :p
[22:48:41] <LukeNukem> Eviltwin, would you know how i can grab an element based on its rel attribute?
[22:49:04] <GoSox> Eviltwin: so i'm curious, what website did you think i was working on?
[22:49:10] <Eviltwin> LukeNukem: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[22:49:27] <Eviltwin> GoSox: Something I'd never heard of, which you were :P
[22:49:50] <GoSox> oh
[22:49:55] <GoSox> i thought you thought it was something specific
[22:50:21] <LukeNukem> which one do i use for rel attribute?
[22:50:41] <Eviltwin> There's no selector that's specific to the rel attribute
[22:50:52] <Eviltwin> It would be insane to make selectors specific to every attribute
[22:51:18] <LukeNukem> hmm,i wonder how lightbox works then
[22:51:25] <LukeNukem> because it grabs elements with the rel attribute
[22:51:55] <Eviltwin> *facepalm*
[22:52:03] <mehrdad> lol
[22:52:18] <Eviltwin> Open the link I sent, look at the third thing on the list
[22:52:37] <Eviltwin> Through the ninth
[22:53:22] <Eviltwin> Click on them if you're still not getting it
[22:53:48] <LukeNukem> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-prefix-selector/
[22:53:51] <LukeNukem> right?
[22:54:01] <Eviltwin> Sure, that's one of them
[22:54:04] <GoSox> how can i reference a parent? for example i want to addClass() to $(this)'s parent item
[22:54:24] <Eviltwin> GoSox: api.jquery.com
[22:54:41] <Eviltwin> Try searching "parent" on there
[22:55:59] <GoSox> Eviltwin: do you use TextWrangler (or BBEdit)?
[22:56:07] <Eviltwin> Nope
[22:56:20] <Eviltwin> Why?
[22:56:36] <GoSox> just wondering
[22:57:20] <GoSox> i had used BBEdit for years, pirated. then i found TextWrangler, which is the free version of BBEdit, but I never used any of the 'extra' features that BBEdit has, so I'm all about TextWrangler now
[22:58:24] <tw2113> sublime text yo
[23:01:39] <GoSox> so this is what i came up with for styling what "currently clicked on" list elements in a listâ¦. its working perfectly but it looks a littleâ¦ crazy
[23:01:40] <GoSox> http://pastebin.com/4b6frZZV
[23:01:54] <GoSox> it is called when an A tag inside the list item is clicked
[23:01:57] <Eviltwin> Could you do this in jsFiddle instead?
[23:02:08] <GoSox> well it is functioning
[23:02:10] <Eviltwin> It lets us actually see and tangibly debug it
[23:02:12] <GoSox> i'm not trying to 'fiddle' persay
[23:02:23] <Eviltwin> Use .parent().siblings().removeClass instead
[23:02:40] <GoSox> whats the diff between siblings() and children()?
[23:02:56] <Eviltwin> Well the terms are like a family tree
[23:03:15] <Eviltwin> There's a difference between your siblings and your children
[23:03:25] <Eviltwin> Hopefully...
[23:03:31] <GoSox> OH duh i get it
[23:03:37] <Eviltwin> I heard some weird things happen in the south
[23:03:45] <GoSox> i may be IN florida right now but i'm not FROM florida
[23:04:07] <Eviltwin> .siblings() also excludes the element itself
[23:04:14] <Eviltwin> Which means then the two statements could happen in either order
[23:04:31] <Eviltwin> API page explains it further
[23:05:11] <GoSox> hah i hate coding javascript, but it's so friggin cool when it works
[23:05:22] <Eviltwin> jQuery takes away a lot of the pain
[23:05:32] <Eviltwin> Helps you get to what you actually wanted to do faster
[23:06:16] <GoSox> this house has central air. every time the ac comes on, it slams my door closed
[23:07:30] <yamama> hello. i'ts not directly related to jquery, but maybe you can help me / have already seen that
[23:07:51] <yamama> i'm having trouble removing line breaks from a string in php
[23:08:02] <Eviltwin> yamama: I suggest you visit ##php
[23:08:16] <GoSox> use the line break to <br> function, then the strip tags function
[23:08:21] <yamama> nothing works, str_replace('"\n" , "\r" etc
[23:09:13] <yamama> GoSox i need my tags, i'm wondering if there are other characters than \n \r that can produce a line break ?
[23:09:32] <Eviltwin> yamama: Not in ASCII
[23:09:47] <yamama> in utf8 ?
[23:09:50] <Eviltwin> But again, ##php
[23:09:56] <yamama> yep right
[23:09:56] <Eviltwin> That's where you should go for this
[23:09:57] <yamama> thx
[23:10:11] <yamama> will do, thx
[23:10:38] <GoSox> Eviltwin: you a ML seeder?
[23:11:02] <Eviltwin> No, I'm planning to just wait for the release
[23:11:06] <yamama> Eviltwin: php is invite only ?
[23:11:09] <GoSox> oh
[23:11:09] <Eviltwin> Hate working with pre-release OSes
[23:11:17] <Eviltwin> yamama: There's a difference between #php and ##php
[23:11:43] <GoSox> it's much better than lion
[23:11:47] <yamama> "you need to identify with network services"
[23:11:52] <GoSox> i put it on a firewire drive
[23:12:06] <Eviltwin> GoSox: I've actually only been on Lion a few months now because I was waiting until I had time to do a wipe & install
[23:12:13] <Eviltwin> yamama: /msg NickServ help register
[23:12:18] <GoSox> i hated lion so much, i had to revert my desktop to snow leopard
[23:12:19] <yamama> thx
[23:12:22] <hobs> meh, snow leopard is the last release I was at all interesteed in, lion sucks
[23:12:34] <GoSox> so i'm trying to be more active in the seed program, maybe i can actually influence things a bit
[23:12:38] <Eviltwin> There are things I like about Lion and things I really don't
[23:12:38] <hobs> I dont like ios so its all going downhill
[23:12:44] <hobs> to me
[23:13:06] <Eviltwin> At least 50% of what I do is done through the Terminal
[23:13:07] <GoSox> yeah, the biggest lion problems to me, that remain in ML, are the lack of expose & spaces, and the lack of scroll bar arrows
[23:13:11] <Eviltwin> And that hasn't been changing too much
[23:13:21] <hobs> yeah or at all
[23:13:23] <GoSox> i rarely used the terminal these days
[23:13:31] <hobs> im talking to you via said terminal
[23:13:38] <Eviltwin> There's no expose or spaces in Lion?
[23:13:44] <Eviltwin> That doesn't sound right
[23:13:46] <GoSox> it has mission control instead
[23:13:47] <hobs> its all "mission control"
[23:13:52] <GoSox> but mission control is NO expose
[23:13:56] <Eviltwin> Meh
[23:14:00] <GoSox> and its a much less powerful version of spaces
[23:14:02] <hobs> I dislike the removal of spaces having vertical spaces too
[23:14:02] <Eviltwin> It has all the Expose features I ever used
[23:14:07] <Eviltwin> And I never used Spaces much
[23:14:10] <Eviltwin> Just found it annoying
[23:14:18] <Eviltwin> It doesn't really make up for not having multiple displays
[23:14:22] <GoSox> i heavily use expose and spaces (on my desktop)
[23:14:27] <Eviltwin> And once you have multiple displays, Spaces is just annoying
[23:14:32] <GoSox> Eviltwin: i have multiple displays and spaces :D
[23:15:06] <hobs> same
[23:15:23] <GoSox> mission control's "expose" piles up your windows into groups, so you can't actually see individual windows, which defeats the whole purpose of expose!
[23:16:09] <hobs> yeah well the I feel like apple is just moving back towards super focusing on entry level users and not worrying so much about their power users
[23:16:09] <GoSox> its a great newb tool, but its very crippled compared to the real things
[23:16:15] <Eviltwin> I thought they had serveral different modes for it
[23:16:17] <Eviltwin> But w/e
[23:16:23] <Eviltwin> I never used it much anyway
[23:16:33] <Eviltwin> I only accidentally trigger it
[23:16:48] <Eviltwin> Let's see, swipe up is show all apps (with stacked windows)
[23:16:55] <Eviltwin> Swipe down is show all windows in the current app
[23:16:56] <GoSox> in mission control, you can pinch on each pile to open it up. But guess what, my mac pro isn't an iPad. It has a MOUSE and a KEYBOARD. Mission control does NOT work for me at all
[23:17:12] <Eviltwin> Get yourself a Magic Trackpagd
[23:17:15] <Eviltwin> Trackpad*
[23:17:19] <GoSox> i really have no interest
[23:17:27] <GoSox> well i have some interest, but not for mission control
[23:17:34] <hobs> lets buy two input devices and switch between them
[23:17:39] <GoSox> spaces and exposed worked perfectly without taking your hand off the mouse
[23:17:39] <hobs> id prefer to not even use the mouse tbqh
[23:17:43] <Eviltwin> For most things, I've actually grown to prefer the Apple trackpads over mice
[23:18:03] <Eviltwin> Most trackpads suck ass
[23:18:05] <GoSox> not me, i'm a mouse man
[23:18:06] <Eviltwin> But Apple's don't
[23:18:14] <GoSox> i mean on my macbook pro, i use the trackpad
[23:18:20] <GoSox> but i always work much better on a mouse
[23:18:32] <GoSox> the gestures are cool but not cool enough
[23:18:52] <Eviltwin> I prefer two-finger scrolling to scroll wheels
[23:18:58] <GoSox> me too
[23:19:01] <Eviltwin> Especially with momentum
[23:19:02] <disusered> ya inertial scrolling is great
[23:19:06] <Eviltwin> And I like the rubberband scrolling
[23:19:41] <GoSox> but there are plenty of situations where clicking on the arrow in a scroll bar is the preferred way to move a big window a little bit
[23:19:44] <hobs> Eviltwin: is that where it keeps going a bit and then snaps back
[23:19:52] <hobs> because you hit the bottom
[23:19:58] <disusered> ya
[23:20:01] <hobs> I dislike that
[23:20:08] <hobs> why am I going farther than the bottom
[23:20:32] <Eviltwin> hobs: I felt the same way at first
[23:20:42] <hobs> its like some of the compiz stuff where windows have momentum and their edges snap around
[23:20:45] <Eviltwin> But to me it feels less disruptive than hitting the bottom hard
[23:20:48] <hobs> just seems like useless eyecandy
[23:20:50] <Eviltwin> Now that I'm used to it
[23:21:02] <GoSox> mountain lion has fixed lion's horrible ical and address book
[23:21:06] <GoSox> which was a huge relief to me
[23:21:11] <GoSox> and it seems noticeably faster
[23:21:22] <disusered> yea it's a usability feedback thing, hitting a hard stop is awkward
[23:22:11] <hobs> it stops, then you are at the bottom, its not like someone smacks you in the face
[23:23:17] <disusered> it stops and then you lose the finger/object connection. it stops responding to input
[23:23:40] <disusered> it's more of a phone thing tbh i'm ambivalent about it on osx
[23:23:56] <hobs> I guess I can see the brain plasticity part of it
[23:24:26] <hobs> input is always responded to even if it is purposeless
[23:24:31] <disusered> yes
[23:24:39] <GoSox> hobs you should send some feedback to apple about bringing back expose and spaces of 10.6, at least as an advanced option
[23:25:12] <hobs> I did
[23:25:16] <GoSox> great
[23:25:20] <hobs> back when I did work for them lol
[23:25:25] <GoSox> oh
[23:25:26] <GoSox> i mean now
[23:25:29] <GoSox> :D
[23:25:29] <GoSox> again
[23:25:31] <GoSox> and again
[23:25:33] <hobs> forever
[23:25:34] <GoSox> until they do it
[23:26:00] <GoSox> i would love to put my desktop back on the current OS. although 10.8 might not even support my 1st ten mac pro
[23:26:02] <GoSox> gen*
[23:26:15] <disusered> mountain lion's mission control is different from lion's?
[23:26:15] <GoSox> 8x2.66GHz isn't fast enough to run mountain lion :P
[23:26:19] <GoSox> no
[23:26:25] <GoSox> it's the same, that's the proble
[23:26:26] <GoSox> m
[23:26:50] <hobs> are they really saying sys reqs are higher than octo core
[23:26:50] <hobs> lol
[23:26:59] <disusered> i thought i would hate mission control, being a spaces fan. i've grown to like it as long as i disable automatic arrangement
[23:27:01] <GoSox> one thing i read said "late 2008 and newer"
[23:27:08] <GoSox> mine's a heavily upgraded 2006
[23:27:13] <disusered> i feel that 'feature' just disrupts the mental map of my workspaces
[23:27:31] <hobs> well they dont generally prevent based on sn
[23:27:39] <hobs> just mhz rams and hd space
[23:27:39] <disusered> also keybindings for switching vdesktop don't switch into full-screen apps
[23:27:42] <GoSox> disusered: i love 10.6's spaces, but it's really expose that is the deal breaker. I can't function without expose
[23:27:45] <disusered> hard stop
[23:28:18] <hobs> whats your graphics card
[23:28:35] <GoSox> 5770
[23:28:37] <disusered> mm with app expo and mc i don't really feel i'm missing much from leopard
[23:29:05] <GoSox> disusered: too much code in that sentence, what?
[23:29:16] <hobs> yeah you will probably run it fine, I think the requirement is based on some of gpu stuff and a core 2 duo or better
[23:29:26] <disusered> application-window expose and mission control
[23:29:31] <GoSox> ill find out when i get home
[23:30:15] <GoSox> Mountain Lion has this new quirky behavior
[23:31:07] <GoSox> in all previous versions of OS X, you could drag a file into an "Open" dialog (sheet) and it would auto navigate to and select that item. In Mountain Lion, doing this actually MOVES the file you are dragging, as if you dropped it into a regular Finder window instead of a file open dialog/sheet
[23:31:25] <disusered> omg
[23:31:32] <disusered> that's one of my favorite osx things
[23:31:39] <disusered> vs windows
[23:31:51] <GoSox> yeah i've already filed a bug report
[23:31:58] <disusered> thanks :)
[23:32:13] <GoSox> its crazy, you end up accidentally moving your files into whatever 'default' locations the open dialogs open up to
[23:32:24] <hobs> lol
[23:34:13] <Eviltwin> Clearly the best feature of Lion is all this Duplicate and Save instead of Save As stuff
[23:34:42] <GoSox> the best feature of lion (sans sarcasm), is lion's Mail
[23:35:09] <Eviltwin> Depends on what you're doing with it
[23:35:20] <Eviltwin> For example the search is massively fucked up
[23:35:26] <Eviltwin> In the demos it all worked flawlessly
[23:35:27] <GoSox> it is?
[23:35:39] <GoSox> i haven't noticed any problems, since maybe 10.7.1
[23:35:43] <Eviltwin> But in terms of it actually finding your messages, it sucks
[23:36:02] <Eviltwin> I was trying to search for an email I received two weeks ago
[23:36:17] <Eviltwin> Starting typing the address in the serach
[23:36:18] <GoSox> are your mailboxes IMAP or local?
[23:36:21] <Eviltwin> search*
[23:36:26] <Eviltwin> It completed with the address
[23:36:27] <Eviltwin> I clicked it
[23:36:28] <Eviltwin> No results
[23:36:32] <Eviltwin> Not in Inbox, not in All
[23:36:32] <hobs> lol @ duplicate and save
[23:36:45] <Eviltwin> I eventually just started scrolling through the list
[23:36:48] <Eviltwin> And found it
[23:36:53] <Eviltwin> They're IMAP
[23:37:00] <Eviltwin> But Mail keeps a local copy of all the mail messages
[23:37:07] <GoSox> maybe you should delete your local mail and let it re-sync
[23:37:21] <GoSox> i've never had that problem on lion, and i have several large imap accounts
[23:37:42] <Eviltwin> I have 7 large IMAP accounts
[23:38:05] <mehrdad> passing arguments between function calls is implied by the arguments keyword right?
[23:38:18] <Eviltwin> What?
[23:38:42] <GoSox> i've got about 80,000 total message and it works like a charm. except its slow because Lion is on my laptop, which has a slow 2.5" drive, where my desktop has a SSD + HDD config, and i keep my mail folder on the SSD
[23:38:58] <Eviltwin> I have a SSD + HDD rig for my laptop
[23:39:06] <Eviltwin> It's a 15" MacBookPro5,1
[23:39:10] <Eviltwin> So it has an ExpressCard slot
[23:39:15] <mehrdad> the arguments keyword receives all the arguments passed to a function albeit not an explicit parameter in the parameters list
[23:39:16] <Eviltwin> And I got a 48G ExpressCard SSD
[23:39:19] <GoSox> i replace my laptop usually every year, so i don't spend money on custom configs
[23:39:22] <mehrdad> is that how it works?
[23:39:23] <Eviltwin> mehrdad: Yes
[23:39:26] <mehrdad> ok
[23:39:45] <mehrdad> thx
[23:39:47] <GoSox> i have thought about replacing my macbook's HDD and Optical with a pair of smaller SSD's in a fast raid
[23:39:48] <Eviltwin> This thing is like 6 years old and still holding up pretty well
[23:40:15] <Eviltwin> Actually, wait, I think this is only 3-4
[23:40:24] <Eviltwin> My previous one would have been 6
[23:40:40] <GoSox> Eviltwin: when  making websites, do you make them work in IE, or do you block older versions of IE, or do you just let IE fend for itself?
[23:41:03] <Eviltwin> I design them to work in Safari or Chrome
[23:41:08] <Eviltwin> Make tweaks as needed for Firefox
[23:41:14] <Eviltwin> And then at least look at it in IE
[23:41:23] <Eviltwin> And if there's something that should be a quick fix, I fix it
[23:41:25] <hobs> then the crying jags begin
[23:41:26] <Eviltwin> But otherwise I just leave it
[23:41:53] <Eviltwin> I'm all for Microsoft trying to innovate
[23:41:57] <Eviltwin> But not at the cost of standards compliance
[23:41:58] <GoSox> i actively block IE 6 and IE 7 on whatsmyip.org. But I'm using lots of nth-child() on MenuLizard which IE8 also doesn't support
[23:42:19] <GoSox> so i'm thinking about blocking IE6-8
[23:42:24] <Eviltwin> You're using them in CSS or in jQuery selectors?
[23:42:30] <GoSox> CSS
[23:43:02] <disusered> you could use selectivizr as a polyfill but you get a bit of fout. then again some fout beats nothing. then again depends on your target audience. too complicated to have a consistent browser support matrix
[23:43:59] <GoSox> i'm also dying to start using all the new HTML tags like <header>, <footer>, <article> etc, which can't be styled properly in IE8 and below (i think)
[23:44:28] <disusered> you can just use html5shiv
[23:44:31] <disusered> modernizr has it baked in
[23:44:39] <tw2113> ^
[23:44:46] <tw2113> a touch of js tells IE that it can style those
[23:45:45] <disusered> it's fun to use them but it's easy to spend more time than necessary on selecting semantic elements
[23:46:01] <mehrdad> Eviltwin, i am not going to speak in defense of ms again and be slammed because of spams, but i am curious how do u expect that to work out? i mean being standards compliant and innovate at the same time. what if an innovation depends on a feature that is specific to windows, then they can't take advantage of that? think dx filters
[23:46:02] <tw2113> don't touch <section> then
[23:47:40] <hobs> mehrdad: you could say the same thing about webkit specific stuff, I dont think that it is wrong argument
[23:47:42] <GoSox> i hate i.e. specific work arounds
[23:47:46] <GoSox> they make me so angry
[23:48:04] <tw2113> i don't know if i'd call it a work around
[23:48:12] <tw2113> more like a lightbulb
[23:48:30] <tw2113> and it doesn't break validation
[23:48:48] <mehrdad> because u know opinions differ and not everyone agrees
[23:49:19] <mehrdad> but whatever..back to job
[23:50:01] <hobs> well dont be afraid to speak because of internet rage is all
[23:50:11] <GoSox> here's my IE work around for WhatsMyIP.org : http://www.whatsmyip.org/browser-upgrade/
[23:50:23] <GoSox> (only 6 & 7)
[23:50:54] <GoSox> which together only add up to 5% of my traffic when I implemented this, and of that 5%, i betcha half is from indian SEO spammers and other non legit users
[23:53:33] <GoSox> hey did that website work or not work for anyone?
[23:54:35] <GoSox> i think i just accidentally triggered my server to firewall me
[23:56:43] <GoSox> Do jQuery's http requests use the browser's own user agent?
