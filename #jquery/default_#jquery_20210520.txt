[02:55:29] <Cork> Robdgreat: they have been extreamly hard to get in contact with for years so i don't think that is going to happen
[02:56:40] <robertmaxrees> i heard from one member of the foundation earlier - they were completely unaware of what was going on.  that plus the low traffic to the channel makes it hard to know what comes next.
[03:04:38] <undefined_bob> maybe you guys can just call them?
[03:04:48] <undefined_bob> like via land line?
[03:05:26] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahhaa.
[03:05:56] <undefined_bob> that was no joke oO
[03:07:08] <undefined_bob> for me its always easier to just call people when I cant reach them online
[03:08:34] <robertmaxrees> oh totally - i do have one person's phone number but otherwise, nada.  the channel's just sorta... slowly dying.  not surprising given jquery's place.
[03:16:08] <undefined_bob> but I like this channel and I like jquery
[03:16:12] <Cork> ya, i find it more likely that the irc channel dies completely then it moving to libera.chat
[03:16:52] <undefined_bob> and I like you two guys too
[03:23:53] <pavonia> We could always start an unofficial jQuery channel in case the official one dies
[03:28:18] <Cork> there is already one
[03:29:04] <Cork> a total of 6 users 4 users :)
[03:29:08] <Cork> opps
[03:29:11] <Cork> * 4 users
[03:30:50] <undefined_bob> I cant connect to the new libera.chat anyway at the moment. I have to wait until they support tor
[03:31:16] <Cork> why do you require tor to connect to an irc server??
[03:34:05] <undefined_bob> because my companys firewall block IRC traffic. But if I use a local tor proxy for IRC I can bypass the firewall
[03:34:23] <Cork> interesting...
[03:34:57] <Cork> you could just run znc on a machine at home at set it on a none blocked port :)
[03:35:22] <undefined_bob> its annoying because it makes everything complicated
[03:35:37] <Cork> doesn't have to be
[03:35:54] <undefined_bob> yes, that would be an other solution, I guess. But I'm not very firm with znc at all
[03:36:56] <undefined_bob> I meant, it was complicated to configure my irc client for being able to use tor and to connect to freenode
[03:37:17] <Cork> znc should be simpler
[03:37:37] <Cork> and the best part is that you get a perma scollback
[03:37:54] <Cork> well unless your home loses connection but *shrugs
[03:37:55] <Cork> *
[03:38:07] <undefined_bob> because my windows here is pretty old and I had to find an IRC client with supports SASL external but still runs on windows server 2003
[03:38:36] <undefined_bob> yes, I think I should learn more about all this znc
[03:38:51] <Cork> znc basically becomes your own irc server
[03:39:02] <Cork> so you don't need to care about sasl or nickservers
[03:39:14] <Cork> the client need to be able to connect to your bouncer, the reset is handled by znc
[03:41:22] <undefined_bob> and that znc is like a programm I install on, lets say, my Windows deskop PC at home?
[03:42:10] <Cork> well it is a unix program
[03:42:23] <Cork> so if your on windows only you will need cygwin or wsl
[03:43:28] <undefined_bob> oh I'm using cygwin right now :)
[03:43:56] <undefined_bob> because weechat was the only client which supported SASL external AND runs on windows 2003
[03:44:03] <Cork> https://wiki.znc.in/Installation#Cygwin
[03:44:39] <undefined_bob> I think I can figure it out
[03:50:04] <Uhkis> good old ssh+screen+irssi ftw!
[07:33:13] <undefined_bob> all my friends moved their channels from freenode to oftc today
[07:47:10] <Cork> uff not the best choice
[07:47:21] <Cork> oftc doesn't even have decent services
[07:47:33] <undefined_bob> I have no idea. I did not know that irc network before
[07:48:02] <undefined_bob> I prefered Rizon but my friends said its for 'Weeebs' whatever that means
[07:48:11] <Cork> its the irc network for qemu, powerdns, ceph, bcache and a few other quite big ones
[07:48:41] <undefined_bob> my friend works with ceph, maybe thats why he choose it
[07:54:03] <undefined_bob> but where will you go, Cork? Or are you going to stay here?
[08:10:23] <Cork> undefined_bob: i'll stay in the channel with the active users
[08:10:54] <undefined_bob> mhm okay
[08:11:03] <Cork> i've created an account on libera.chat, have one on oftc sence a long time a go
[08:11:07] <Cork> so, me
[08:11:11] <Cork> *meh
[08:12:08] <undefined_bob> you could be everywhere :)
[08:16:10] <Cork> i pretty much are :)
[08:16:49] <undefined_bob> that's cute :)
[08:17:16] <Cork> i'm on 8 networks and ...
[08:17:27] <Cork> 68 channels in total >_>
[08:17:28] <undefined_bob> I still remember how patiently you helped me years ago. I still love you for that
[08:17:51] <undefined_bob> puh thats a lot of channels and networks
[08:18:07] <Cork> ya, ones joining it is hard to leave, so it adds up
[08:18:41] <undefined_bob> hehe true, I know that feel
[08:18:45] <Cork> was quite active in irchighway and ricon and irctoo scanslations when i was young
[08:19:24] <undefined_bob> hm I dont know those
[15:55:42] <Destramic> with autocomplere styling, how do you make the each item in the list height bigger please.....i just cant find the css for it
[15:56:35] <robertmaxrees> which autocomplete.
[15:56:36] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:59:57] <robertmaxrees> Destramic
[16:00:00] <Destramic> jquery built in autocomplete, i can make a fiddle if you like..
[16:00:05] <robertmaxrees> sure...?
[16:00:10] <robertmaxrees> you mean jquery ui?
[16:00:38] <Destramic> yes :)
[16:01:17] <Destramic> the items height is small, and i cant for the life make them bigger
[16:01:30] <Destramic> last thing on my life to finish this page :p
[16:01:48] <robertmaxrees> would need a fiddle then.
[16:02:12] <Destramic> can i pm you the address please?
[16:02:18] <robertmaxrees> why a pm?
[16:03:18] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle...
[16:04:15] <robertmaxrees> i'm just gonna start posting the links that people DM me soon lol
[16:04:27] <robertmaxrees> could you make a fiddle Destramic?
[16:06:27] <robertmaxrees> either way, if memory serves, you need to target .ui-menu .ui-menu-item.  might be a specificity issue.
[16:07:39] <Destramic> robertmaxrees sorry
[16:07:54] <Destramic> robertmaxrees i will try what youve suggested, if not i can mkae a fiddle, thank you
