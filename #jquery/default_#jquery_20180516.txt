[02:11:54] <Stummi> good morning. Say theres a website which uses jquery to $.ajax to load content into a div after some specific events. This can happen multiple times during the websites lifetime. I want to add a userscript which processes this data whenever this happens (I can modify the original source and its mostly done through anonymous functions I cannot override). What is the best practice to approach this? Using some Dom Change Listener?
[02:12:17] <Stummi> I *cannot* modify the original source I mean
[02:17:07] <Cork> Stummi: add a .done() chain call
[02:17:47] <Cork> ex. org code is $.ajax().done(org-function), then just do $.ajax().done(org-function).done(extra-function)
[02:18:16] <Stummi> Cork, as said its in a method I cannot modify,  so I think I have no way to reach the ajax object
[02:19:09] <Cork> Stummi: you could use $(document).ajaxSuccess(extra-function)
[02:19:20] <Cork> https://api.jquery.com/ajaxSuccess/
[02:21:17] <Stummi> I think this will do. Thanks!
[06:18:59] <argarath> yo, I want to append product price to a div using jquery when event is triggered so obviously I've used .append
[06:19:05] <argarath> but what if I want to replace currently appended text?
[06:19:31] <argarath> I mean update
[06:19:33] <argarath> instead of append
[06:20:44] <shoky_> argarath: use .text() or .html()
[06:21:15] <argarath> thank you!
[06:21:27] <argarath> lol I thought .text() is working a little bit different
[06:42:40] <devish> guys, images inside jquery are giving me 404
[06:42:45] <devish> like jquery-trap-input/lib/jquery/themes/base/images/ui-bg_glass_75_e6e6e6_1x400.png
[06:43:24] <devish> the url where it was not found is https://devish:8443/css/images/ui-bg_glass_75_e6e6e6_1x400.png
[06:43:37] <devish> do I need to download this image and push it ?
[06:47:18] <Dro> anyone have an idea about "magnific popup" ? trying to disable a button that lead to a popup
[06:47:22] <Dro> but can't find how :(
[07:07:28] <baine101> i seem to bve having a problem with ajax changing the url to the page im currently on and putting url encoded spaces (%20) in the url
[07:38:36] <Cork> baine101: space isn't valid in urls
[07:38:42] <Cork> and %20 == space
[07:39:39] <Cork> devish: same domain?
[07:39:51] <devish> yes
[07:40:18] <devish> cork ^^
[07:40:23] <Cork> devish: what is the given url to what ever tries to load it?
[07:41:03] <Cork> i quite strongly recommend to NOT use relative urls, always use absolute ones
[07:41:28] <Cork> cause what is the base when resolving relative urls is a mess
[07:42:04] <devish> Cork: I was using cdn and it was working fine for everything
[07:42:42] <Cork> ah, bah missed that it is a standard image...
[07:42:45] <devish> but after downloading the jquery into my native issue started. When I search these images in google I find it in jquery library
[07:43:02] <Cork> can you reproduce in a publicly accessable site?
[07:43:07] <Cork> (ex. jsfiddle.net)
[07:43:44] <devish> however I get 404 w.rt to image and the url given is wrong because /images/ I mapped for extra images
[07:43:59] <devish> Cork: fiddle will be difficult
[07:44:15] <Cork> devish: what matters is the css file you're loading
[07:44:29] <Cork> and that the path there matches to where you intend to load the image from
[07:45:15] <devish>  registry.addResourceHandler("/css/**").addResourceLocations("/css/");
[07:45:32] <Cork> no, that isn't what i need even remotely
[07:45:46] <devish> css has jquery-ui.css if that is what you meant
[07:46:25] <Cork> you need to look at the generated css and make sure the background-image url() url matches with where the image is located on the server
[07:46:34] <devish> I can put these images in /css/images/ folder but that is like hardcoding
[07:47:03] <Cork> if you want to change the url you need to look into what ever you use to manage the css
[07:47:26] <Cork> (if anything)
[07:47:57] <devish> Cork: where are the generated urls ?
[07:48:15] <Cork> in the html resource?
[07:48:21] <Cork> the <link> tag
[07:48:31] <Cork> the search in the css file
[07:48:43] <devish> haha, got it
[07:49:14] <Cork> but look in the browser NOT in the source tree, as the content there might differ
[07:50:03] <baine101> Cork: i know im not wanting ajax to do that , im giving it a completely different url from the one thats in the XHR request
[07:50:26] <Cork> baine101: it isn't ajax doing it
[07:50:34] <Cork> it is the browser, and it is required to do it by the rfc
[07:50:47] <Cork> cause a http client _is not allowed_ to send space in the url
[07:51:12] <baine101> Cork: im pretty sure thats not the case
[07:51:30] <Cork> baine101: you want me to point you to the rfc dictating it?...
[07:51:33] <Cork> yes it is required
[07:51:42] <baine101> i have an ajax function where the url it make the request is set progmatically
[07:51:50] <Cork> browsers hide this in some cases by replacing %20 with space when rendering it
[07:52:41] <baine101> their are two urls and using the first url to POST data works  , the second which PUTS data seems to get lost and the current pages url is used but with added spaces
[07:52:58] <Cork> if you want to revert it you can use decodeURICompoent https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURIComponent
[07:53:10] <Cork> but it is not what will be sent over the wire either case
[07:53:24] <baine101> Cork: I really dont think you grasp whats happening
[07:54:01] <Cork> baine101: %20 in the url is cause you have a space there
[07:54:15] <baine101> Cork: but i dont
[07:54:18] <Cork> you do
[07:54:18] <baine101> 1 second
[07:54:42] <devish> jquery css is here https://devish:8443/css/jquery-ui.css which includes link of image background: #cccccc url("images/ui-bg_highlight-soft_75_cccccc_1x100.png") 50% 50% repeat-x;
[07:55:02] <baine101> Cork: https://paste.ofcode.org/P3w9fvgfFhKseujjvRTTWX
[07:55:15] <baine101> their is the ajax call and the function to set the url
[07:55:32] <Cork> devish: so the image is expected to be in /css/images/ui-bg_highlight-soft_75_cccccc_1x100.png
[07:55:41] <devish> so final link i get is https://devish:8443/css/images/ui-bg_highlight-soft_75_cccccc_1x100.png
[07:55:45] <devish> Cork: yes
[07:55:50] <baine101> the url ajax ends up actully making the request too on the PUT is this  : /provider%20/%20location%20/%20edit%20/%201781
[07:56:31] <devish> Cork: how the image would come there. Means how they will be extracted from where ever they.
[07:56:46] <Cork> baine101: can you reproduce this in a jsfiddle? i need live code to have any use of it
[07:56:53] <devish> Or do i manually put it there and get it work, seems easy for now
[07:56:57] <Cork> devish: you have to put it there
[07:57:10] <Cork> devish: it is included in the jquery-ui theme package
[07:57:34] <baine101> Cork: ill attempt too
[07:58:40] <devish> got it thanks Cork
[08:00:52] <baine101> Cork: i cant replicate the error due to permissions on the urls
[08:01:28] <Cork> baine101: the only thing i can think of is the source isn't encoded in utf-8
[08:02:49] <Cork> but ya, it is just guessing without seeing a working example
[08:33:52] <dimi1979> is it possible that when a form is to be serialized I can manipulate the string before it reaches the server?
[08:34:08] <Cork> depends
[08:34:22] <dimi1979> Cork:on what?
[08:34:29] <Cork> you can modify it before it is given to $.ajax
[08:34:42] <Cork> or you can wrap/replace $.ajax
[08:34:49] <Cork> but other then that, no
[08:35:15] <dimi1979> how I could modify it before it is given to $.ajax
[08:35:40] <dimi1979> ??
[08:35:56] <dimi1979> or perhaps it is better to describe the problem I am facing?
[09:00:47] <ircplace> Hi, I trying to figure out how to give first p with same text a class name --> https://jsfiddle.net/wwdt2fsf/
[09:06:22] <AdamPDotty> hmm, https://jsfiddle.net/wwdt2fsf/1/ ?
[09:08:23] <ircplace> AdamPDotty: the first "text" and first "text2" in each p tag should be red
[09:08:44] <AdamPDotty> ah
[09:09:30] <AdamPDotty> Did not get that.
[09:09:35] <ircplace> like this --> http://i.imgur.com/2W5e3Ws.png
[09:10:39] <ircplace> so if same text would show up again, it will always give a class only at the first one
[09:11:03] <AdamPDotty> You can add ".eq(0)" before addClass(). It works, but is probably not the best solution.
[09:11:28] <ircplace> ok, can u show me how?
[09:11:47] <AdamPDotty> https://jsfiddle.net/wwdt2fsf/2/
[09:12:00] <AdamPDotty> There has to be something better, but I have no idea right now. :-)
[09:12:39] <ircplace> oh, thats better, but it should do it on each p tag
[09:13:32] <AdamPDotty> hehe
[09:20:51] <AdamPDotty> looks complicated
[09:33:21] <dimi1979> https://hastebin.com/osegikuzac.js can see this code and tell me what the 1 in the means?
[09:33:34] <dimi1979> in the end
[09:34:06] <Cork> grab the second match from the regex array
[09:34:53] <Cork> the first in the array will be the full match string so the second is the \[(\d)\]
[09:37:17] <dimi1979> so the number is related to the regex
[09:37:21] <dimi1979> ??
[09:37:32] <Cork> the number is regexed from the name ya
[09:38:06] <Cork> namenumber that is
[09:39:00] <dimi1979> and what do you mean exactly by saying grab "the second match from the regex array"?
[09:39:18] <Cork> have you tried removing [1] and see what it gives you?
[09:39:37] <dimi1979> no.....give me a minute to test...nice idea
[09:39:44] <Cork> heh...
[09:40:08] <Cork> also https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match
[09:40:31] <AdamPDotty> ircplace: https://jsfiddle.net/wwdt2fsf/4/
[09:42:00] <Cork> what are you trying to do?
[09:42:11] * Cork looks lightly horrified at the code...
[09:42:19] <Cork> s/slightly/
[09:42:30] <AdamPDotty> yes, I know
[09:42:56] <ircplace> AdamPDotty: oh nice :D thx
[09:42:58] <AdamPDotty> he wanted to add a class to the span the first occurence of a text inside each p
[09:43:03] <ircplace> have never used THAT
[09:43:10] <ircplace> need to learn :P
[09:43:15] <Cork> ircplace: just a variable name...
[09:43:26] <Cork> it could just as well be t2
[09:43:41] <ircplace> oh I see :)
[09:44:06] <ircplace> thougt it was something simliar to THIS ;)
[09:44:12] <Cork> so you want to find each span, that is the first element in a p and mark all other spans with the same text and is the first in there p?
[09:44:16] <ircplace> big thx :)
[09:44:26] <Cork> or just first occurrence?
[09:44:29] <AdamPDotty> not quite
[09:44:40] <AdamPDotty> first occurence per text per p
[09:45:38] <AdamPDotty> like p span:first-of-contains
[09:46:44] <ircplace> first-of-contains might work to?
[09:46:59] <ircplace> too*
[09:52:24] <AdamPDotty> does not exist, but identifies problem
[09:52:54] <AdamPDotty> Would probably be hart to implement.
[09:53:01] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/wwdt2fsf/5/ is an option
[09:53:07] <Cork> not that is much nicer...
[09:54:12] <AdamPDotty> ah, totally forgot they are siblings
[09:55:06] <AdamPDotty> I do not think you need nextAll for that
[09:55:19] <AdamPDotty> if you drop it, it becomes nice-ish
[09:55:34] <Cork> without nextAll you won't know if it is repeated
[09:56:26] <AdamPDotty> Ok, was not stated as condition, but given the classname makes sense.
[09:57:36] <AdamPDotty> p span:first-of-contains:not(:last-of-contains)
[09:57:38] <Cork> though with :contains() you can't do that reliably anyway
[09:58:06] <Cork> as :contains(text) will happily match "text2"
[09:58:56] <Cork> and that is one of the reasons i _really_ don't like :contains
[10:00:42] <AdamPDotty> so it would go wrong if text2 came before text
[10:00:53] <Cork> no that would be correct
[10:01:14] <Cork> but <span>text</span><span>text2</span> would mark text as duplicated
[10:02:24] <AdamPDotty> <span>text2</span><span>text</span><span>text</span><span>text</span>
[10:02:32] <AdamPDotty> would any get marked?
[10:02:44] <Cork> ya, the first text span
[10:02:52] <Cork> but you're reverting the problem
[10:03:19] <AdamPDotty> prevAll() would hit text2
[10:03:44] <Cork> ah, ya that too
[10:04:02] <Cork> but the problem i talked about was true for all versions
[10:04:54] <AdamPDotty> I would probably set the text as class for each element or something, but there is also no :first-of-class
[10:05:51] <AdamPDotty> I did something alike in a project to order and filter table rows
[10:11:55] <argarath> yo guys, I have this jQ code here https://pastebin.com/c8JV7DdL
[10:12:06] <argarath> any ideas why can I use e.detail.height in crop: function
[10:12:15] <argarath> but in cropend it says undefined?
[10:12:31] <Cork> AdamPDotty, ircplace: this is the only way i can think of to do this reliably: https://jsfiddle.net/wwdt2fsf/6/
[10:12:39] <argarath> and what exactly are these crop: and cropend: ?
[10:13:15] <argarath> btw, Im using cropper.js library
[10:13:16] <argarath> https://pastebin.com/uurEgJhB
[10:13:27] <Cork> still utterly horrible though
[10:13:50] <ircplace> Cork: thx for more options =)
[10:14:08] <Cork> ircplace: the big difference with this one is it will actually only mark duplicates
[10:14:25] <Cork> while :contains will mark it if any other element contains part of it
[10:15:37] <ircplace> Cork: thats true, this is more a safe way to go. =)
[10:19:49] <argarath> bump ._.
[10:21:37] <Cork> argarath: it is made up events, most likely things the lib generates
[10:22:18] <argarath> ah, so crop and cropend are events
[10:22:20] <argarath> now I get it
[10:22:37] <argarath> im back to lurking documentation
[10:22:40] <argarath> thx
[10:56:33] <charolastra> when doing an ajax() request, how is success defined? by HTTP status 200?
[10:57:08] <charolastra> or do redirects like 302 also work?
[10:57:19] <Cork> charolastra: .done() is called when the server returns a 2xx message and the parsing of the response doesn't crash
[10:57:46] <Cork> charolastra: 3xx is transparent to javascript and is resolved by the browser before javascript is even invoked
[10:58:03] <charolastra> interesting, thanks
[10:58:22] <Cork> meaning javascript will never see 3xx responses
[11:24:20] <m00sehead> How do I use event delegation for form submits?
[11:25:05] <m00sehead> can I just do $('body').on('submit', 'form.formClass', function(e) {... ?
[11:25:36] <m00sehead> I understand how it would work with a click event and it bubbling up, but I dont know if thats valid for a submit event on the body
[11:26:12] <m00sehead> for example, the form might not exist yet when I'm adding the events
[13:18:51] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[14:35:25] <dimi1947> take a look at this code...https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/gr6cobrf/
[14:35:49] <dimi1947> is the attr('name') part really necessary?
[14:36:12] <dimi1947> since the first selector target anyway the name attribute
[14:53:01] <dimi1947> noone??
[15:51:53] <gambl0re> hello?
[15:57:37] <robertmaxrees> over 300 folks in here lurkin' ;)
[15:57:49] <pdub> lurrrrkk
[15:58:05] <pdub> i mostly lurk node.js but here for the front endz
[15:58:18] <pdub>  /lurk
[15:58:34] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[15:58:41] <robertmaxrees> been quiet today
[16:03:38] <gambl0re> hi robertbo[m]
[16:04:08] <gambl0re> hi robert
[16:22:57] <gambl0re> robertmaxrees, hey
[16:24:04] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:29:44] <gambl0re> why do you always have to respond with such arrogance? all i said was hello
[16:29:53] <gambl0re> maybe you can say 'hey' back?
[16:29:59] <gambl0re> instead of just ??
[16:30:13] <robertmaxrees> woah
[16:30:23] <gambl0re> seriously, it pisses me off
[16:30:25] <robertmaxrees> it was a question mark.  calm down.
[16:30:31] <robertmaxrees> nothing meant behind it duder
[16:30:52] <gambl0re> when someone says hi, usually the other person responds back with 'hi' not some question mark
[16:31:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:31:13] <gambl0re> i know you think you're better than me but thats fucking rude
[16:31:22] <robertmaxrees> i really don't.
[16:31:23] <gambl0re> i didnt even pm you also..
[16:31:29] <gambl0re> so i dont know what your problem is
[16:31:46] <robertmaxrees> i don't have a problem.
[16:31:57] <gambl0re> whatever
[16:32:37] <robertmaxrees> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[16:34:03] <gambl0re> lick my ass...
[16:36:36] <pavonia> That escalated quickly
[16:36:44] <robertmaxrees> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[16:36:56] <robertmaxrees> it's a long story lol
[16:54:58] <cthulchu> it was funny
[17:00:26] <robertmaxrees> weeee
[19:44:49] <Ninjacoder> yep, ppl the fastest way to export the entiere of this APi in jQuery ? http://api.bitcoincharts.com/v1/weighted_prices.json
[19:46:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:46:40] <Ninjacoder> the btc prices from that file i wanna to export (document.write). you know
[19:46:41] <robertmaxrees> Ninjacoder are you asking how to parse that data or....?
[19:46:47] <Ninjacoder> yep
[19:46:51] <robertmaxrees> ajax?
[19:47:01] <Ninjacoder> js,ajax,jquery
[19:47:11] <robertmaxrees> assuming that they allow cors
[19:47:29] <Ninjacoder> allow cors?
[19:47:36] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/o95v9tw6/
[19:47:46] <robertmaxrees> open your console and reload that fiddle.
[19:47:49] <robertmaxrees> they don't allow ajax.
[19:48:17] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to setup your own server-side proxy.
[19:49:00] <robertmaxrees> and with that, I gotta jet.  enjoy folks.
[19:49:04] <Ninjacoder> did you say i cant see the error msg ?
[19:51:07] <Ninjacoder> works fine if the api doesnt has json or could i parse it btw ?
[19:51:16] <Ninjacoder> (:
[19:53:26] <cannap> what is the response?
[19:53:39] <cannap> you can parse some plain js to JSON.parse()
[19:54:16] <cannap> i mean json to js
[20:05:20] <Ninjacoder> []cannap yep the response, could be in document.write
[23:58:56] <ranum> hello - how can elements that are dragged/dropped using jQuery UI retain their responsiveness to browser resizing?
