[00:07:01] <aiena> I have a table which is returned as a result of an AJAX call in jquery. Now I want to auto scroll this table to the bottom the div has an overflow property. Is .scrollHeight() safe to use to determine height is there a better way ?
[00:08:36] <aiena> using jquery
[00:31:59] <Cork> aiena: there isn't a scrollHeight() but you can use .prop('scrollHeight') as long as it isn't the browser window (then you need to use scrollMaxY)
[00:32:52] <aiena> ok it isn't the browser main window the table is is inside a bootstrap panel
[00:33:15] * aiena looks up how to use scrollMaxY
[00:34:21] <aiena> Cork,  so I need to use  .prop('scrollHeight') if it is not the widow but a div for example inside it ?
[00:34:43] <Cork> yes
[00:35:27] <aiena> ok thank you I will try that
[00:35:35] <Cork> np
[00:36:13] <aiena> does that work with jquery 2.2.4 ?
[00:36:26] <Cork> it isn't dependent on jquery
[00:36:40] <aiena> ok its pure JS
[00:36:46] <Cork> you need to have .prop() and it was introduced in 1.5 (before it was called .attr)
[00:37:23] <aiena> ok
[02:00:28] <snufft> hi guys
[02:02:12] <snufft> i'm really bad at explaining this stuff
[02:03:47] <snufft> i've got a $(this).on('click', '*', function(){ in my code. I can see it binding in Chrome (if i place a listener on that line in my JS file, i see it run 5 times, one for each returned result), but when I click on any of the returned results children, nothing happens. No errors, the listeners don't fire and the console.log's in the code don't fire either. Does anyone have any suggestions? The children are dynamically generated, which is
[02:03:48] <snufft> why I'm using on('click' on the parent.
[02:04:52] <Cork> snufft: * isn't a good selector to use for delegation
[02:05:08] <Cork> it means every child will have a listener and you will get a lot of duplicated events
[02:05:39] <snufft> Cork, thanks for the response :) i understand that. at the moment it's just so that I can get any kind of output, haha
[02:06:06] <Cork> snufft: try reproduce the problem in a jsfiddle.net
[02:06:18] <snufft> Cork, no worries, i'll give it a shot :)
[02:10:46] <chx> hi. jQuery('article.js-comment a.action-unflag:contains("Best Answer")') selects the <a>. I would like to select the <article> instead.
[02:14:31] <kevireilly> chx: add “ article” at the end
[02:14:58] <chx> i mean, i would like to select the article which contains such a link
[02:16:11] <kevireilly> .parent(‘article’) after the selector
[02:17:12] <kevireilly> or .closest(‘article’)
[02:17:59] <kevireilly> also, from the way back machine, thanks for all your contributions over the years chx :)
[02:18:20] <Cork> chx: .closest('article')
[02:18:31] <chx> kevireilly: :)
[02:18:31] <Cork> ah typ :)
[02:18:36] <chx> Cork: jQuery('a.action-unflag:contains("Best Answer")').closest('article') this does work
[02:18:37] <Cork> *yup
[02:18:39] <chx> and very pretty
[02:18:51] <chx> kevireilly: thanks you as well
[02:18:55] <Cork> chx: ya, that is what was hinted
[02:19:40] <Cork> for reference, css can't do backwards selection, that is why it needs to be separate commands
[02:19:53] <Cork> chx: btw, if possible avoid using :contains()
[02:20:00] <Cork> add a class if possible
[02:23:31] <snufft> Cork, it works in jsFiddle with the exact same code. Is there a way that I can see if events are being removed from an element?
[02:24:11] <Cork> snufft: $._data(elm, 'events') if i remember correctly
[02:24:22] <Cork> elm is the dom element, not a jquery wrapped element
[02:25:56] <kevireilly> you can also check which events are bound to an element at the moment using the Event Listeners tab while the element is selected
[02:26:18] <Cork> kevireilly: that is browser dependent though, not all browsers provide that
[02:26:30] <Cork> (and is why i used $._data())
[02:26:31] <kevireilly> true, I meant with Chrome you can do that hehe
[02:28:49] <chx> i guess i could work on getting the flag id in there.
[02:29:24] <Cork> chx: a good start to check is to make sure the $() selector infront of .on actually finds the parent
[02:29:24] <chx> my next question would be... $link.closest('section').children('article').first().before($link.closest('article').clone().addClass('best-answer')) this is what i came up with to duplicate the best answer at the top. It's not the most beautiful code I've ever written though.
[02:29:37] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[02:29:45] <Cork> snufft: a good start to check is to make sure the $() selector infront of .on actually finds the parent
[02:30:08] <chx> but then again, me writing JavaScript, that's not normal :)
[02:30:31] * Captain_Ramius scratches his head.
[02:30:57] <Captain_Ramius> Why would my blueimp jquery file upload work on desktop but not mobile?
[02:31:06] <Cork> chx: is the article a sibling to the link?
[02:31:37] * Captain_Ramius laughs at himself.
[02:31:46] <snufft> Cork, thanks for that :) There's definitely something weird going on here though. I've found that for the initial click, nothing happens, but for the next click it does what it's meant to. I'm starting to wonder if it's either not bound at the time of the first click, or if there's something else going on :(
[02:31:47] <Captain_Ramius> Disregard.
[02:32:03] <chx> Cork: no, the article is a parent of the link.
[02:32:09] <chx> Cork: ancestor.
[02:32:21] <chx> Cork: and the section is an ancestor of the article.
[02:32:25] <Cork> chx: then you could do .closest('article').siblings(
[02:32:32] <Cork> chx: then you could do .closest('article').siblings('article').first()
[02:32:34] <chx> oooooo
[02:32:40] <Cork> reduces it a little at least
[02:32:43] <chx> neat
[02:33:05] <Cork> if i had the full structure it could prob be simplified a bit more but...
[02:36:20] <chx> Cork: hrm... this is fine. https://paste.kde.org/pirgu8oxe
[02:36:57] <Cork> ya, can't be much cleaner then that i think
[02:37:06] <chx> .first() is not needed.
[02:37:27] <chx> and with that, $article.siblings('article').before($article.clone().addClass('best-answer')); this is not even particularly ugly.
[02:37:53] <Cork> that is risky through
[02:37:58] <chx> why
[02:38:02] <Cork> cause it will run .before on each article
[02:38:23] <Cork> and the element will jump to the last article (as dom's doesn't clone when attached)
[02:38:41] <Cork> so i would keep the .first()
[02:38:58] <chx> OK
[02:41:01] <Captain_Ramius> Hey guys. I'm slugging through the blueimp jquery file upload. Is there a simple way to rename the files incrementally?
[02:41:15] <Captain_Ramius> *using PHP server-side
[02:42:37] <acidjazz> yo, simple js question, var bob = 'test'; suzy.on('thing', function() { // how do i access bob in here });
[02:42:51] <Cork> acidjazz: bob
[02:42:54] <Cork> :)
[02:43:45] <Cork> javascript has scope inheritance, so you can access variables from parent scopes as if they where local
[02:44:25] <Captain_Ramius> Hmmm, TIL ^^
[02:45:02] <Captain_Ramius> Hey Cork. Know anything about blueimp jquery file upload?
[02:45:44] <Cork> nope
[02:46:26] <Captain_Ramius> Thanks anyway. I hate being so close to finishing this part but still so far away.
[02:46:40] <acidjazz> i need to .forEach is my thing
[02:52:28] <snufft> this might be a better question, is there a way to detect a change to a text field, that doesn't come from typing?
[02:58:07] <chx> thanks all.
[02:59:52] <kevireilly> snufft: what sort of change?
[03:00:35] <snufft> kevireilly, when you click another part of the site, the input field text is pre-populated, but you can also type in that same field. I was wondering if there's a way to watch the field to see when it's changed by something that's not typign :)
[03:10:54] <kevireilly> snufft: changed by js, paste, or a different use case?
[03:11:38] <snufft> kevireilly, changed by js :)
[03:12:22] <kevireilly> are you able to control the changing by JS?
[03:12:28] <kevireilly> I mean, are you doing it
[03:13:17] <kevireilly> slash could modify the routine, because AFAIK there isn’t something for when JS changes the value
[03:15:20] <kevireilly> but you can .trigger(‘change’) and listen to that event, though presumably there would be other options at that point as well
[03:18:19] <kevireilly> snufft: another subpar option would be periocically querying the input value and evaluating against the previous state to determine if it has changed
[03:25:49] <Cork> though the timed query solution is, something you should avoid
[03:25:56] <Cork> cause that is horrible >_<'
[03:26:32] <Cork> if there is a function you know does the change you could wrap it and notify you're self about the change when it happens
[03:26:39] <Cork> it is a ton better then using timers for this >_<
[03:31:41] <kevireilly> yup, if you can control that part
[03:32:03] <kevireilly> oh monkey patch it, good idea indeed
[03:32:19] <Cork> well not monkey patch, it is more live patch
[03:32:34] <Cork> monkey patch involves modifying the original source file
[03:32:39] <Cork> something you don't need to do
[03:34:01] <kevireilly> that is a monkey patch yah. Modifying at runtime.
[03:52:12] <printFor_> Question... Is it better to use onclick() or to catch the event with jQuery?
[03:52:28] <printFor_> Clicking on an <button> or <a> or anything.
[03:53:10] <printFor_> I believe its better to have it in jQuery as .on('click') instead of writing it inline
[03:57:43] <Cork> printFor_: it is by far better to separate the js from the html, so jquery
[03:57:57] <Cork> (or addEventListener that is the native function jquery uses)
[04:03:25] <printFor_> right
[04:33:37] <Duikb00t> o/
[04:54:30] <Duikb00t> Hi Cork, I've made a correction to the example of yester. What I would like to accomplish is that I have unique field for importing them in my database.

[05:20:04] <YokoBR> hi folks
[05:21:08] <YokoBR> is there a way to change shadow opacity with jquery .css() without splitting the box-shadow string and modifying the RGB value?
[05:21:13] <Duikb00t> g0t it
[05:33:54] <YokoBR> I guess not
[06:44:33] <rockwood> i am totally confuse in use ajax in datalist tags

[07:14:54] <YokoBR> I'm almost getting it
[07:14:55] <YokoBR> https://jsfiddle.net/hhby9m3c/2/
[07:16:09] <Cork> YokoBR: why not just have a separate css class with the other value and control it that way?
[07:16:25] <Cork> (that way you don't have to stick css into your js)
[07:16:53] <TheWild> hello
[07:17:02] <TheWild> https://datatables.net/reference/option/$.fn.dataTable.ext.errMode: it supports only alert, throw and none. However I want to display error message just like "No data available is displayed".
[07:17:12] <TheWild> Is there a simple way to accomplish it without me clearing the table, creating a <tr> block, creating a <td> block and removing "Processing" block.
[07:17:17] <TheWild> ^ ?
[07:23:28] <YokoBR> Cork: It's a visual editor for webpages... so the code must be injected, not added to classes :|
[08:04:55] <randohinn> o/
[08:05:25] <dglambert> morning
[08:06:11] <randohinn> Is there a way I can use $.unload to detect wheter the user is moving to a completely different domain? Eg. detect leaving my site
[08:06:12] <randohinn> ?
[08:09:59] <slax0r> so you can popup a "PLZ STAY HERE WE LOVE U AND HAVE COOKIES" spam?
[08:10:40] <randohinn> naah, building an analytics tool after Ga doesn't cut it anymore :P
[08:10:54] <randohinn> want to detect what pages the site is left on
[08:13:09] <slax0r> randohinn: was pulling your leg
[08:13:13] <slax0r> but no, you can't do that
[08:13:43] <randohinn> dangit
[08:14:35] <slax0r> that'd be a disaster if browsers reported that to every open page you are on
[08:14:45] <slax0r> privacy disaster*
[09:02:07] <tomc9> hey guys not sure if this will come under css or javascript but I have a box which when clicked executeds .box:hover {} which displays a div absolutely positioned underneath, this works fine but on mobile devices when you click the hover appears and I want to set it so if you click the original box with the :hover state it removes the popup div, any ideas?

[10:03:21] <interop_madness> is there a way to register an event handler for all custom(!) events of an element? i.e. $(selector).on("event1, event2, ...") is not a solution and default handlers like click etc. are not needed either
[10:03:40] <interop_madness> (minus the comma between the events)
[10:19:08] <snufft> ok
[10:20:01] <snufft> so i have a few spans that seem to disappear on click, except when watching the click handler in chriome dev tools, click does not fire :D where else should I look? Is there a similar event to click that's not quite click?
[10:21:53] <tsukasadt> Could someone tell me why $('a:contains(\'Next >>\'):first').attr('href') works and $('a:contains(\'Next >>\'):first').click() doesn't? https://jsfiddle.net/rdefeaeo/
[10:30:06] <Lebbe> try $('a:contains(\'Next >>\'):first')[0].click()
[10:31:37] <tsukasadt> Lebbe, bingo! ty
[10:33:00] <Lebbe> please read https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/click before thinking about using something like that in "prod"
[10:33:05] <SlimmyJimmy> jQuery mobile doesn't like me using labels in a controlgroup?
[10:33:35] <SlimmyJimmy> It sets the width x height to 1px
[10:33:49] <tsukasadt> Lebbe, it's for a userscript. ^^'
[10:35:19] <Lebbe> :) I use it in test cases with a controlled browser. lack of support in android etc makes me vary of using it on an actual webpage/app
[10:36:57] <m9l> Hey! I have an html input tag with a name, and in my .js file I do alert(e.target.name) when the input element is clicked. But when the name in the input tag has a space in it, I only receive the first word! Does anyone know why that is?
[10:38:55] <tsukasadt> I would never use .click() on anything live for other people. I'd instead use eventListeners to trigger functionality. The userscript I'm writing is just for retrieving data from a static page (it's VERY old) to be converted into a database. It has no use beyond that and will only be executed via userscript by me, so I'm not concerned about compatibility. It only has to work once. ^^'
[10:40:10] <Lebbe> sounds like a perfect use case if you ask me :)
[10:53:12] <SlimmyJimmy> data-role="content" is being deprecated? What about data-role="header"?
[11:09:59] <csplugins> $("#FirstId, #Second").change(function () {  ....         is this syntax correct?
[11:10:25] <csplugins> Or is it supposed to be       $("#StartDate", "#EndDate").change(function () {
[11:12:34] <Lebbe> first is correct
[11:13:10] <Lebbe> unless you specifically want to find a #StartDate that is located within #EndDate
[11:13:23] <Lebbe> but that seems irrelevant for IDs
[13:00:24] <daynaskully> Q: I want to use the following jquery $('.class.hidden:first').nextAll().andSelf().slice(0,5).removeClass('hidden'); to get some hidden elements and make them visible (works great) but i also want to know when there are no more hidden class elements after execution so i can remove the on-click button (how do i issue a callback on the removeclass())
[13:01:11] <taplar> why not do a count afterwards?
[13:01:47] <taplar> and why are you doing :first if your are going to then do andSelf() ?
[13:02:31] <daynaskully> taplar, i was thinking precicely that (counting if elements exist after executed) -- and :first with .nextall doesn't include the first element
[13:03:43] <daynaskully> but when i try to do a .removeClass('hidden', function(){ alert('hi'); }) -- it doesnt work
[13:03:47] <taplar> my brain is still frozen from an icee.  yea id' just do a count
[13:04:55] <taplar> var $temp = $('.class.hidden:first').nextAll().andSelf();  $temp.slice(0,5).removeClass('hidden');  if (!$temp.filter('.hidden').length) { /* blah */ }
[13:06:14] <daynaskully> ahh nice, yea simple. I was stuck on the train tracks of single path thought
[13:07:24] * taplar plays some lynard skynard simple man
[13:07:52] <taplar> think i typoed that, :O ;(

[13:55:15] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:21:36] <Yepp> what state does 'click event' checks? I have a checkbox and when click, I count all checkboxes that has .checked class. The problem is, on the 'click' callback it says 0
[14:21:37] <Yepp> https://paste.ee/p/6OEmf
[14:22:06] <Yepp> I expect it to be 1 or number of checkboxes that has .checked class
[14:22:50] <Yepp> it works the opposite way tho. If I clicked it again to uncheck it, it says it has 1 or number of checkboxes
[14:23:23] <taplar> where are you adding this 'checked' class on click?
[14:23:34] <taplar> cause really you should be filtering by the checked property, not the class
[14:23:47] <taplar> 'the class' being whatever class
[14:24:16] <robertmaxrees> also: these are checkboxes, right?
[14:24:28] <robertmaxrees> should use the change event.
[14:24:43] <robertmaxrees> also, look at the checked property instead of a class.
[14:25:00] <robertmaxrees> like taplar said.
[14:25:32] <Yepp> taplar: actually it looks like this: https://paste.ee/p/8laOQ
[14:25:53] <robertmaxrees> fwiw that opening label is incomplete.
[14:25:59] <robertmaxrees> but you don't need to rely on classes there.
[14:26:03] <Yepp> whoops
[14:26:23] <taplar> i don't see in that markup the '.js-table-checkbox' that you are targeting
[14:26:38] <Yepp> fixed it: https://paste.ee/p/G6ENJ
[14:27:07] <Yepp> taplar: didn't include it. but it's getting targeted for sure
[14:27:11] <Yepp> only it works in opposite
[14:27:23] <taplar> in any case.  $('.js-table-checkbox').filter(function(){ return this.checked; }).length
[14:27:27] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:29:41] <Yepp> i'll fiddle with for a while again.
[14:39:47] <Yepp> fixed. only changed on click to on change. tried tracing the plugin that comes with the project
[14:40:52] <backnforth> Hi, does jQuerys .$post post forms for data?
[14:41:16] <taplar> 'data'?
[14:41:36] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:41:40] <robertmaxrees> it'
[14:41:41] <slax0r> no, it does not
[14:41:51] <robertmaxrees> *it's just a convenience method for $.ajax
[14:42:21] <slax0r> you can $(form selector).serializeArray() however
[14:42:33] <slax0r> and get the required data object for your $.post()
[14:43:58] <taplar> what 'data'?
[14:44:02] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:44:57] <slax0r> taplar: I'm guessing form data, user input
[14:45:23] <taplar> he might also be meaning data-* stuff.  it's very unclear, which is why i'm asking for clarity, ;)
[14:45:32] <robertmaxrees> i'd be interested in getting clarification from backnforth heh
[14:45:39] <robertmaxrees> good learning experience.
[14:46:15] <backnforth> I'm looking to have something in struct format
[14:46:25] <slax0r> ..
[14:46:54] <taplar> so just some random javascript object?
[14:46:58] <backnforth> Yes
[14:47:10] <taplar> sure, you can post those.  just have to serialize them
[14:47:15] <taplar> or it will do it for you, iirc
[14:47:22] <slax0r> you don't need to serialize
[14:47:37] <slax0r> passing {foo: 'bar'} to $.post or any other similar method is perfectly viable
[14:48:31] <robertmaxrees> sure, just gotta build up the object.
[14:53:53] <backnforth> Ok sounds easy enough
[14:59:43] <Motoservo> I have a table with some hidden cols that appear when a button in a col header is clicked. These cols are to the left, so it pushes my clicked col to the right (to make room). Anybody know a way to keep my clicked col under the pointer and have the cols to the left, slide left, to make room for the newly revealed cols?
[15:14:56] <GeekMonkey> I can't seem to get my html5 video to autoplay on android
[15:14:59] <GeekMonkey> any suggestions?
[15:15:51] <robertmaxrees> didn't google explicitly try to disable that?
[15:17:59] <GeekMonkey> they did??? robertmaxrees?
[15:18:18] <robertmaxrees> iirc yeah
[15:18:34] <robertmaxrees> because autoplaying videos are annoying and can kill battery.  could have that wrong though.
[15:20:40] <bbear> hello
[15:21:15] <taplar> aloha
[15:21:54] <GeekMonkey> robertmaxrees anythought on how to override if that is the case
[15:22:29] <robertmaxrees> why do you need autoplaying videos?
[15:26:28] <GeekMonkey> robertmaxrees it is for a video bg... I got it working on ios
[15:26:37] <GeekMonkey> and other browsers but not android
[15:27:43] <GeekMonkey> According to what I am reading it says it should work from chrome 53 and up.... I have android chrome 55
[15:30:29] <systemdarena> i googled this with only 1 decent question, but am still wondering... whats the reasons to use jquery's $(this).val() vs just this.value ?
[15:30:39] <systemdarena> err.. 1 decent answer*
[15:31:02] <GeekMonkey> Seems android is blocking the autoplay
[15:31:02] <taplar> consistency
[15:31:36] <ekkis> I'm running a service on port 9000 that provides me with a form.  I want to post that form from jQuery so what I did was to create a form with all the same fields and an action set to the right url, but when I click the submit button, I just get the original form... what could I be doing wrong?
[15:31:51] <taplar> systemdarena: also iirc older browser's do not load the innerHTML of a textarea into the value property, so if 'this' can be a mixture of inputs or textareas then $(this).val() would normalize that
[15:32:54] <taplar> ekkis: without seeing what you are trying to do we'd just be guessing.
[15:33:27] <ekkis> taplar: I'm not sure I could show you because it's running locally but let me find you the system...
[15:33:50] <taplar> it doesn't necessarily have to function.  just seeing the logic can help
[15:35:08] <ekkis> taplar: https://avatar.playat.ch:1000
[15:35:29] <ekkis> this is a sample.  that service is running on the public web but it's the same underlying form
[15:35:53] <taplar> i am unable to access it.  some https issue
[15:36:01] <ekkis> so what I'm wondering is: is it possible for me to define a form of my own with all the same fields, submit it to that url and have it work?
[15:36:05] <ekkis> really?
[15:36:17] <robertmaxrees> "is it possible for me to define a form of my own
[15:36:17] <ekkis> ok, go here: https://thelounge.github.io
[15:36:17] <robertmaxrees> with all the same fields, submit it to that url and have it work?
[15:36:23] <ekkis> and click on Try Demo
[15:36:27] <robertmaxrees> so you want to know if you can post cross-domain
[15:36:43] <ekkis> well... yes
[15:36:46] <taplar> same https issue
[15:37:01] <ekkis> eventually, the domain will be the same because it will be running locally for me
[15:37:06] <robertmaxrees> ekkis up to your CORS policy.
[15:37:53] <ekkis> although, I think as far as CORS is concerned, it'll be a different domain because it will be on a different port
[15:38:00] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:38:07] <robertmaxrees> port, protocol, and domain must match.
[15:38:12] <robertmaxrees> you're on a different port.
[15:38:39] <ekkis> so would I need to enable cors on the chat service?
[15:38:54] <robertmaxrees> are you getting errors related to cors?
[15:38:55] <ekkis> it's not something I need to do at the client end right?
[15:39:22] <ekkis> not yet, what happens right now is that when I hit the submit button for the form I put together I get another form
[15:39:26] <robertmaxrees> reading back, i'm not seeing that you're even using any jquery - you just have a normal form,.
[15:39:31] <ekkis> the form that the url normally proposes
[15:39:36] <GeekMonkey> robertmaxrees it seems chrome has a flag that you can disable
[15:39:41] <BeachedStork> I keep getting the same ID on my "addToCart" url, I know I'm doing it wrong, how do I do it for each addToCart? https://jsfiddle.net/r0bdawfh/
[15:39:47] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey for autoplay?
[15:39:50] <GeekMonkey> http://techdows.com/2015/12/chrome-47-lets-you-disable-defer-media-playback-in-background-tabs.html
[15:39:51] <GeekMonkey> Ya
[15:39:58] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey sounds about right.
[15:40:16] <GeekMonkey> but it requires the user to actually turn it off.... I wonder if there is a way to override that
[15:40:22] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[15:40:39] <robertmaxrees> just like you can't really override whewther or not you open a new window or tab on desktop.
[15:40:40] <GeekMonkey> there's gotta be a way
[15:40:47] <robertmaxrees> heh that's pretty user hostile tbh.
[15:41:02] <robertmaxrees> "this user doesn't want autoplaying videos - who cares about them though?"
[15:41:15] <taplar> BeachedStork: line 8 is a global lookup
[15:41:50] <robertmaxrees> ekkis so then you need to point your form to the same action endpoint.
[15:41:56] <robertmaxrees> not to the page the other form is on.
[15:42:02] <taplar> BeachedStork: change it to be a contextual lookup within '..details'
[15:42:09] <ekkis> robertmaxrees: yes, for right now it's just a form.  eventually I'll need to submit the form with jquery so I thought I'd ask here first
[15:42:11] <taplar> * '.details'
[15:42:45] <robertmaxrees>  ekkis this is a different set of problems than what you'd get with an ajax post fwiw :)
[15:42:49] <ekkis> robertmaxrees: something odd: the original form has an empty action, so I'm presuming the action is the same as the url that called it
[15:43:05] <robertmaxrees> newp.  that means the original form is submitted via ajax.
[15:43:25] <robertmaxrees> at least that's my guess.
[15:43:31] <BeachedStork> taplar: I figured which is why it has only one, am I suppose to create a new each() statement or do I use a $(this).parent().find('.details > .actions > .addToCart')
[15:43:40] <GeekMonkey> robertmaxrees it is funny I can override in ios but not in android
[15:44:03] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey because ios is comfortable with devs being hostile in that regard :)
[15:45:04] <taplar> BeachedStork: $(this).closest('.details').find(...)
[15:45:31] <BeachedStork> fak close enough
[15:45:34] <BeachedStork> thanks!
[15:45:37] <taplar> sure
[15:55:44] <bbear> $(".delete_user").click(function(){
[15:55:45] <bbear>         alert("You tried to delete user");
[15:55:51] <bbear> <-- I have something like that
[15:56:11] <bbear> many of those buttons on my page
[15:56:19] <bbear> how would you do to fix this ?
[15:56:26] <taplar> what's the issue?
[15:56:30] <bbear> btw the alert doesn't pop
[15:56:34] <bbear> I wonder why
[15:56:42] <taplar> you should use console.log instead, fwiw
[15:56:50] <systemdarena> cool, thanks taplar
[15:57:18] <bbear> yeah
[15:57:22] <bbear> but that's not working
[15:57:31] <bbear> maybe it is because of the class definition
[15:57:32] <taplar> got a fiddle with your code?
[15:57:37] <bbear> nop
[15:58:10] <taplar> can you make one?  otherwise make sure there are no console errors and you can try logging the length of the selector to make sure it is finding elements to bind on
[15:58:11] <bbear> url ?
[15:58:17] <taplar> jsfiddle.net
[15:58:55] <bbear> $('.delete_user').length is 14
[15:59:00] <bbear> so there are some elements
[15:59:22] <taplar> where did you stick that?
[16:03:44] <bbear> https://jsfiddle.net/5ohyz2Lk/
[16:03:47] <bbear> that's a sample
[16:04:00] <bbear> that's weird because it works here
[16:04:10] <bbear> click on delete and you'll have the alert popping
[16:04:15] <taplar> yep
[16:04:28] <bbear> you know that my list of users is generated by JS
[16:04:40] <bbear> maybe that's why it can't be found in the DOM unless I refresh something.
[16:04:43] <robertmaxrees> need a delegated lkistener.
[16:04:45] <taplar> which is why i asked where you stuck $('.delete_user').length to get your number
[16:04:46] <bbear> what da you think ?
[16:04:46] <robertmaxrees> *listener
[16:04:51] <bbear> in my console
[16:05:03] <bbear> taplar: I really put this in the JS console
[16:05:10] <taplar> you need to put it immediately before the binding for it to be accurate
[16:05:25] <bbear> immediately 'before' the binding
[16:05:29] <bbear> you mean ?
[16:05:36] <taplar> yep, to reflect how many exist at the time you are trying to bind
[16:07:13] <bbear> I don't really understand
[16:07:27] <taplar> $('selector).click
[16:07:37] <taplar> that is trying to bind a click handler to element that it finds
[16:07:46] <taplar> to find them they must exist in the DOM at that point in time
[16:07:56] <taplar> future element created will not be affected
[16:08:11] <taplar> so, to know how many it will bind against, you console log the length at that point
[16:08:14] <bbear> yes, so I have te redefine it after creation ?
[16:08:20] <bbear> taplar: yes
[16:08:22] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener instead.
[16:08:28] <robertmaxrees> bbear
[16:08:34] <bbear> yes yes
[16:08:37] <taplar> (i'm trying to get him to do some debugging)
[16:08:46] * robertmaxrees disappears
[16:08:50] <bbear> really i'm in a hurry this project must be finished in 2 days I'll have it working
[16:08:58] <bbear> and then anything listeners/promise whatever
[16:09:18] <bbear> sorry that's sad reality deadline are not cool for patient learners :|
[16:09:39] <taplar> then yes short answer use a delegate listener instead and bookmark http://fixingthesejquery.com/ for later reading
[16:48:35] <TubbyTommy> It seems jQuery.mobile ignores iconpos="right" when it's the only button? :X
[16:49:41] <robertmaxrees> you put the attribute on the nav or the icons themselves?
[16:50:03] <TubbyTommy> on the <a> elements
[16:50:26] <robertmaxrees> supposed to go on the navbar itself iirc.
[17:17:31] <taplar> weird day.  i went from super busy to .....uh, what do i do now?  mode
[17:19:22] <robertmaxrees> those are the weirdest.
[20:01:30] <Motoservo> having trouble understanding which jquery to run. if I have element #xyz that is off to the right, out of view, and I want to scroll to it. What is the jquery I’d run?
