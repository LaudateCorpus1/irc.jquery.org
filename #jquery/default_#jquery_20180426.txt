[00:46:05] <tfitts> I'm trying to simulate a click on the trash icon in gmail.  I've been able to target the element but if I call .click() on it nothing happens.  Anyone know another way I can do this?
[01:23:37] <pavonia> tfitts: Does .get(0).click() work?
[01:25:13] <tfitts> nope
[01:28:02] <tfitts> there's not a way to send a key either right?  With the keyboard shortcuts sending # will delete the selected messages but I don't think that will work.  I guess I can run record a macro and play it all night.  I was just hoping I could run a script that would run in a loop and delete my old messages.  I'm out of the 15gb of storage in my gmail account and it's from years of emails from amazon all without an attachment.
[01:28:17] <tfitts> takes forever to delete them.  none of the tricks for mass deleting emails work on them for some reason
[02:31:43] <Cork> tfitts: the script most likely check the events trust value, and you can't fake the event if it is
[02:32:17] <Cork> tfitts: the best option might be to find the function triggered and see if you can call it directly
[04:07:31] <itsgokul> help ajax response showing in browser inspect but also shows 500 internal server error
[04:52:12] <Cork> uh, what do you expect do be able to do in jquery about a 500 error...
[07:44:26] <a_ok> is there a performance benefit in using "var jqDocument = $(document);" And than using "jqDocument.size()" instead of "$(document).size()" ?
[07:44:53] <Woet> a_ok: benchmark it
[08:02:28] <a_ok> Woet: Little to no difference. as soon as I put a string as a selector (like 'body'). The performance degradation is severe
[08:13:05] <ryan_ford> it should be more performant with a cached $ object as the otherway it's going to rerun the query every time
[08:21:20] <Cork> $() just wraps the dom element in a jquery object so the cost is only in gc
[08:21:34] <Cork> so the difference is minimal
[09:04:06] <MajestyMaiden> hey guys! does anyone use summernote?
[09:22:22] <pashkinmv> Is there any way to disable Keyboard interaction in jquery ui autocomplete?
[09:24:39] <ryan_ford> preventDefault? https://devdocs.io/jquery/event.preventdefault
[09:25:35] <ryan_ford> *should you* is a strong question though. have you thought about how that would effect accessibility?
[09:28:19] <pashkinmv> I apply autocomplete to textarea and business demands disable up/down keys interaction on autocomplete
[09:30:04] <ryan_ford> so they just want it on blur or on enter instead of every key up/down?
[09:30:06] <ryan_ford> makes sense
[09:31:00] <ryan_ford> another option would be to use a small delay to keep it from re-running while user is typing
[09:32:54] <pashkinmv> I guess not to open menu on up/down keys while it's closed
[09:35:10] <pashkinmv> I can't control textarea's cursor using keyboard at all
[09:35:53] <pashkinmv> on up/down it opens menu instead of following lines up and down
[09:36:45] <ryan_ford> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6043506/jquery-ui-autocomplete-disable-select-close-events
[09:38:14] <ryan_ford> sorry i misunderstood the question before ðŸ™ˆ
[09:49:15] <Cork> pashkinmv: you would have to extend autocomplete to do that
[09:49:32] <Cork> it isn't super hard but it can't be done with just fiddling with events
[10:39:59] <pashkinmv> Thank everyone, I've solved this by patching source adding "if (this.isMultiLine) return;" after "case keyCode.PAGE_UP:" in "keydown: function( event ) {" block
[10:47:39] <Cork> ugg, i said extend, not monkey patch...
[10:52:10] <taplar> lol
[13:55:19] <edocpord> Can someone help me troubleshoot a problem I'm having? the code is here: www.epiclutesolo.com/gen/gen.js  and you can see it running here: www.epiclutesolo.com/gen
[13:55:57] <edocpord> what should be happening is, when you click on one of the generated names in the four boxes, it should change the name in the box, and the details in the hover panel
[13:56:16] <edocpord> this happens intermittently, but a lot of the time it updates the name but doesn't change the details in the hover panel.
[14:05:04] <taplar> when you click?
[14:14:09] <edocpord> taplar: yeah, when I click on a name it will chang ethe name, but it doesn't update the floating panel.
[14:14:40] <taplar> i don't really see any click logic on that page.  i see the panel when i hover.
[14:15:21] <edocpord> http://www.epiclutesolo.com/gen/gen.js
[14:15:32] <edocpord> in the main $(document).ready() there's some click events
[14:15:53] <taplar> my organization is blocking that page.  but I can get ot the /gen page.  that's where i'm seeing the hover logic
[14:15:53] <edocpord> the one that handles the names is calling gen_char()
[14:16:21] <edocpord> can you view source on it?
[14:16:41] <edocpord> oh, it won't let you just view the source. Here I'll pastebin it
[14:17:11] <taplar> weird, now it's blocking the /gen page.  my place is crazy, :s
[14:17:20] <edocpord> https://pastebin.com/9HeHHZ6h
[14:18:33] <edocpord> :X
[14:19:50] <taplar> and it's the click logic that you say some times does not update?
[14:21:13] <taplar> $(patron+"_desc") is interesting.  do you have a different hover for each patron?
[14:23:31] <edocpord> yeah. Each patron has their own details. Their name is loaded into a div called "patron1", "patron2", etc and the details in the hover box are loaded into divs called "patron1_desc" etc
[14:23:59] <edocpord> if you look at the gen_char() function it updates both the patron div, and the patron _desc div
[14:24:22] <edocpord> the patron div updates everytime its clicked but the patron _desc div isn't for some reason
[14:24:25] <edocpord> only about half the time
[14:26:58] <taplar> so what I would do is stick a debugger; statement in there.  verify that the element that it should be updating is being found, and that the data that you are trying to append to it, is being returned correctly
[14:46:34] <edocpord> taplar: It's really weird. I checked to see if the patron_desc elements even exist. They exist during the ready() event, but they no longer exist when I click them later.
[14:49:31] <edocpord> http://www.epiclutesolo.com/gen/ if you can load that watch the console. when ready() fires it calls gen_char 16 times, and every time it logs "exists" to the console. But later when you click them, it calls gen_char (you can tell because it changes the name you're clicking on... but it doesn't log "exists" to the console any more because its not seeing those divs.
[14:49:35] <edocpord> I'm super confused.
[16:05:05] <morenoh149> is there a widget that implements a select dropdown but will remove an item if already picked in another form?
[16:05:29] <morenoh149> is there a widget that implements a select dropdown but will not show an item if already picked in another form?
[16:10:55] <z1haze_> I have a simple but confusing question ( at least for me) If i have an ajax call that returns some html wrapped in a <nav> element, i want to put the sppend not contents of the nav to the dom somewhere, not the nav itself
[16:11:16] <z1haze_> it is just as simple as $(response).find('nav').html() ?
[16:11:49] <taplar> the response is <nav>stuff</nav>?
[16:25:10] <z1haze_> yea
[16:25:39] <z1haze_> its a multi purpose api call, 90% of the time i want the nav, but in one scenario i dont
[16:26:13] <z1haze_> in this scenario i already have a nav, where its doing <nav><nav><a href="#"...</a</nav><nav> i mean it works i just want to not have it
[16:27:08] <taplar> then you do either $(response).prop('innerHTML') or $(response).children() or $(response).contents()
[16:27:44] <taplar> the first will get the inside as html, the second will get the children, but not any top level lose text elements, and the last should get it all
[16:27:51] <z1haze_> so my solution will still include the <nav> ?
[16:28:14] <taplar> $(response).find('nav') would not find anything, as the top level element is the nav
[16:28:54] <taplar> if response is <nav>stuff</nav> that is
[16:29:39] <z1haze_> it is
[16:29:53] <z1haze_> so can i do $myObj.append($(response).children()) then
[16:30:08] <taplar> provided there are no loose top level text elements, yes
[16:30:16] <z1haze_> cool thank you
[16:30:33] <z1haze_> and i dont need .html() then?
[16:30:42] <taplar> nah, you can append Elements
[16:31:14] <z1haze_> sweet, thanks as always
