[04:40:49] <magician03> Hi, would like to help out any bugs and contribute to some projects, (Novice)
[05:03:48] <maxpeb> hi
[05:03:55] <magician03> Hi there, would like to help out any bugs and contribute to some projects, (Novice)
[05:04:18] <maxpeb> ok
[05:04:29] <maxpeb> i need some help
[05:04:46] <magician03> Yeah, I will try my best :)
[05:04:56] <maxpeb> well
[05:04:58] <maxpeb> https://cointrust.xyz/wp-content/plugins/cointrust/custom/js/profilefront.js?ver=1.0.93
[05:05:25] <maxpeb> check from line // replace <trust> with li, remove , and replace with .
[05:05:33] <maxpeb> the whole code works
[05:05:38] <maxpeb> perfectly on page and not on another
[05:06:59] <magician03> Ohh, wait a sec, I am going through that :)
[05:07:52] <maxpeb> see https://cointrust.xyz/profile/hprivakos/ here it won't show up the trustbox but here it does: https://cointrust.xyz/profiles/
[05:08:34] <maxpeb> while for that certain user no trust reasons were ticked on in the backend
[05:11:44] <magician03> What do you mean by trust box .? , that green coloured trust reason box ..?
[05:11:58] <maxpeb> exactly
[05:12:26] <maxpeb> in the backend the options you can tick are wrapped with <trust> tags
[05:12:34] <maxpeb> then in the frontend converted to li tags
[05:15:32] <magician03> Okay, but look at the dev console, class with name "trustworthy_reasons" is not being rendered in 1st link where are it is being rendered well in the 2nd link right after the suspicion class
[05:17:30] <maxpeb> magician03 that is the point
[05:17:42] <maxpeb> if no trust reasons are selected the box should be hidden
[05:18:04] <maxpeb> and it is hidden on the first link but it shows all trust reasons on the second link while not were selected for that user
[05:18:29] <maxpeb> there are no console errors
[05:18:39] <maxpeb> so I'm clueless as to what is causing this
[05:19:22] <magician03> okay, then the class trustworthy_reasons shoudnt be appearing the 2nd link, am I right, just because no options were selected !
[05:23:38] <magician03_> Okay, figured out something, look the /profiles/ route, everyone over there has all the trust options ticked, but on looking at the individual profile /profile/hprivakos/
[05:24:47] <magician03_> looks like ,the trust values are sent to the profile/user/ route but not to the profiles/ route in general, so it couldnt read anything and simply rendering everything
[05:25:09] <maxpeb> yea how do we fix that?
[05:25:17] <maxpeb> cause I removed the js code
[05:25:20] <maxpeb> and then it worked fine
[05:25:33] <maxpeb> as in not all trust reasons shown up for all users
[05:25:41] <maxpeb> on /profile/
[05:26:24] <magician03_> hello
[05:26:28] <maxpeb> Hey
[05:26:38] <maxpeb> [11:25] <maxpeb> yea how do we fix that? [11:25] <maxpeb> cause I removed the js code [11:25] <maxpeb> and then it worked fine [11:25] <maxpeb> as in not all trust reasons shown up for all users [11:25] <maxpeb> on /profile/
[05:26:41] <magician03_> Yeah, just checking the connection
[05:27:51] <maxpeb> ok
[05:27:55] <maxpeb> hopefully there is a fix
[05:28:35] <magician03_> the trust values of users in /profiles/ where all users all users might be null instead of yes or no, so its going on and displaying all the trust values for all the users, with trust score of 90/11
[05:29:06] <maxpeb> hmm
[05:29:11] <maxpeb> what you suggest we change?
[05:29:22] <magician03_> are you reading from the database in the /profiles/ route the trust values of all users..?
[05:29:50] <maxpeb> its fetched from the sql db for Wordpress yea
[05:30:01] <maxpeb> and displays fine without the js code I coded
[05:30:11] <maxpeb> as in empty boxes for users with no reasons ticked
[05:30:15] <maxpeb> and filled up boxes
[05:30:19] <maxpeb> for users with reasons ticked
[05:30:40] <magician03_> Ohh, both in profile/username and profiles/ route ..?
[05:31:00] <maxpeb> gonna double check
[05:31:12] <magician03_> Yeah sure :)
[05:31:52] <maxpeb> check
[05:31:54] <maxpeb> you can see
[05:32:13] <maxpeb> I'll add the code back once you've seen it
[05:32:41] <magician03_> yeah ok, what are you using for the backend ..?
[05:33:12] <maxpeb> Wordpress > pods plugin
[05:33:25] <magician03_> How do I see it, is it on github ?
[05:33:42] <magician03_> I have no idea about wordpress sorry :(

[09:19:27] <chipyy> hey
[09:21:28] <chipyy> Could somebody help me to convert username input to lowercases? http://pastebin.com/DqfdmYdz
[09:25:38] <chipyy> is somebody here? :)
[09:26:11] <JohannesB> The problem is that you are trying to convert something of datatype array to lowercase, which only works for strings
[09:26:23] <JohannesB> so you would have to convert every word to lower case separately
[09:26:41] <JohannesB> so in your $.each loop
[09:26:47] <JohannesB> convert your word to lower case there
[09:26:50] <chipyy> ah ok
[09:26:57] <JohannesB> and remove this line:         var usernamewords=usernamewords1.toLowerCase();
[09:27:13] <chipyy> i think i was already trying that but i failed, i will try again, ofcourse i will remove that line yes
[09:28:03] <JohannesB> make sure to also alter your array to loop through then, as you will remove the array it was looping through
[09:29:11] <chipyy> when i split input into variable, then variable become array right?
[09:29:32] <JohannesB> Yes, a split always creates an array
[09:30:16] <chipyy> ok so now i must create another loop which will go through array and set each word to lower case and then use this array in another loop which will check for banned words
[09:31:05] <JohannesB> You can do that in the same loop
[09:31:20] <JohannesB> word = word.toLowerCase(); will do the trick
[09:32:13] <chipyy> i will have to read some more about jquery loop
[09:32:19] <chipyy> because i dont yet understand it :)
[09:34:36] <chipyy> one more question, i want prevent sql injection and i am thinking to ban this words drop,delete,update and also this sign; " ; =
[09:35:25] <chipyy> and i am also thinking to ban space ' '  in usernames and in passwords
[09:36:14] <chipyy> i think that this i could also use in registration form
[09:36:29] <chipyy> and thank you for help  it works perfect ;)
[09:37:07] <JohannesB> Don't save your passwords plaintext, encrypt them and the spaces won't become a problem
[09:37:43] <JohannesB> also, you should decide on what you want to ban, but make sure you do server-side checking aswell
[09:38:17] <JohannesB> what server-side technology are you using?
[09:38:39] <chipyy> u mean with md5 for passwords? i will use ajax and php
[09:39:02] <JohannesB> If you use php, you should use mysqli instead of mysql and you normally should not have sql-injection problems
[09:39:13] <JohannesB> md5 is deprecated, use a stronger encryption
[09:39:52] <chipyy> what is more stronger decription? i was doing with md5 4 years ago for highschool project :)
[09:40:32] <JohannesB> SHA-256 would be a step-up
[09:40:58] <JohannesB> or even better bcrypt
[09:42:52] <chipyy> ok, i will google about sha-256 and bcrypt, its free i guess?
[09:42:57] <JohannesB> You should use bcrypt actually
[09:43:06] <JohannesB> it's included in php normally
[09:43:50] <chipyy> ok then its great
[09:46:42] <chipyy> now i am reading on w3schools about mysqli and i see that i must have extension for php will be able to communicate with mysqli
[09:47:20] <chipyy> eh i am kind a stupid thats for home use :D
[09:47:33] <chipyy> i guess my servers has already support , i will have to check it
[09:49:53] <chipyy> i would also like to know why u think that i should check also on server side if i already banned all that words and signs? is there still away to enter any of this words? :D
[09:52:49] <JohannesB> If someone turns of his javascript
[09:52:55] <JohannesB> he can simply use those words
[09:53:10] <JohannesB> or if a user mimics ajax calls
[09:54:08] <chipyy> about javascript i already know and if somebody wouldnt have javascript turned on i wont show them my page
[09:55:13] <chipyy> and to prevent mimicing ajax calls then should i check in PHP for this "bannedwords" and this will solve it ?
[09:58:07] <JohannesB> Yes
[09:59:07] <chipyy> ok, tnx again for your advices ;)
[10:10:46] <chipyy> is there any chance to get more separators to split() function=
[10:11:25] <JohannesB> use a replace first, then a split
[10:16:42] <chipyy> hehe, great idea :)
[11:47:44] <zzookk> Hello, guys. I have such code on some web page: <button id="stop" onclick="searcher.subscribe(this, 1, 'HORSE', 3, '4')">text</button>. I need to get second value("HORSE" in this case). How can i do it?
[11:48:24] <zzookk> if i want to create new function searcher.subscribe (a,b,c..) { console.log(b) } i got error
[11:49:04] <zzookk> SyntaxError: missing ( before formal parameters
[11:49:43] <zzookk> how can i fix it?
[12:18:22] <JohannesB> zzookk, try remove the space between subscribe (a,b,c)
[12:18:46] <JohannesB> so it is like function searcher.subscribe(a,b,c..) { console.log(b); }
[12:20:08] <JohannesB> Also, it is not possible to create a function with a dot in the name
[12:20:29] <JohannesB> so you would have to create an object called searcher, that contains the function subscribe
[12:21:39] <JohannesB> like so: var searcher = { subscribe: function(a,b,c..) { console.log(b); } }
[13:15:15] <chipyy> could somebody explain me how to write something like that or paste me link because i dont know how its called query.replace>>>(/ +(?= )/g,'-');<<<< this
[13:18:55] <chipyy> because i would like to replace all ; and = with spaces ' ' , but dont know how to write this
[13:26:05] <TimCoal> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6177200/javascript-jquery-replace-part-of-string
[13:27:31] <chipyy> This is simple yes, but i want to replace all ";" with " "
[13:27:50] <chipyy> replace(/\;/g, ' ') this doesnt work
[13:30:14] <TimCoal> no need to escape
[13:30:34] <chipyy> ? dont understand what u need?
[13:30:55] <TimCoal> var str = originalStr.replace(';',' ')
[13:30:59] <b-ot> works you're am doing it wrongs
[13:31:09] <chipyy> yes but this replace only first ;
[13:31:18] <chipyy> but i want to replace all of this not only first
[13:34:19] <chipyy> replace(/\;/g, ' ') this works
[13:38:51] <TimCoal> what did you change to make it work, its the same as the first one
[13:40:21] <chipyy> i had replaceALL in my code thats why it didnt work
[13:40:32] <chipyy> so it was my mistake
[13:40:52] <TimCoal> we both learnt something :)
[13:41:16] <chipyy> if id would like to change all "h" i would write like this replace(/\h/g,' ') ?
[13:41:36] <TimCoal> yes just red the docs
[13:42:02] <TimCoal> i didn't know you could use regex in replace
[13:42:04] <chipyy> and i just tried and it works
[13:42:17] <chipyy> thats could regex? :)
[13:42:18] <TimCoal> what you building?
[13:42:26] <chipyy> my website
[13:43:10] <chipyy> otherwise i will need that for checking form for sql injection
[13:44:09] <chipyy> @TimCoal i will need that for checking form to prevent sql injections

[14:45:07] <mchelen2> i'm attaching a click handler, and on some page loads it works, other times it doesn't fire. how should i debug this? https://gist.github.com/mchelen/c1a58baeca7b636cd5d094bf66c7498b
[14:54:04] <mchelen2> i mean, i can see the event listener is not being created, but i don't know why
[14:54:55] <D-rex> mchelen2: try it as $(document).on("click",".pledge_submit",function() {});
[14:57:16] <mchelen2> D-rex: it looks like that worked, thanks!
[14:57:39] <mchelen2> so the event handler is being attached to the document instead of the element?
[14:57:52] <D-rex> Yes because the other way you were creating the event handler before the modals were loaded into Dom
[14:59:38] <mchelen2> huh ok, i thought they would all by loaded by the time $(document).ready() fires
[15:01:12] <mchelen2> D-rex: tyvm for the help!
[15:02:40] <D-rex> mchelen2: .pledge_submit is more than likely a button on your modal right?
[15:02:53] <mchelen2> D-rex: yup that's right
[15:03:03] <D-rex> if the modal isnt triggered open when the page los its not loaded into the dom
[15:03:11] <D-rex> loads*
[15:04:34] <mchelen2> hmm, i thought we were loading the html and just making it non-visible via css
[15:04:37] <mchelen2> but i could be wrong
[15:06:20] <D-rex> no perhaps you want visibility:hidden on your css instead of display:none
[15:06:40] <D-rex> that may allow you to do it the way you had it first
[15:07:45] <mchelen2> oh ok, i didn't know display:none would exclude it from event handlers attaching
[15:09:46] <D-rex> I could be wrong about it not loading into DOM but this answer may clear things up http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3475119/css-properties-display-vs-visibility
[15:09:58] <D-rex> that explains it pretty well
[15:10:10] <mchelen2> i'll test rolling back my fix and changing the css instead
[15:14:26] <mchelen2> D-rex: we are using hide/show so it has to be "display" http://api.jquery.com/show/
[15:23:35] <D-rex> mchelen2: ok I would stick to .on() for your click handlers then
[15:27:36] <JZA> hi anyone here know if there is a way that I can get some effect on a jquery ui datepicker
[15:27:52] <JZA> I want to have persistant style change once clicked on a day
[15:28:36] <JZA> so beside selecting the date and having 'getDate' also have a change style in background and also verify that no other day is selected otherwise restore the style.
[15:54:44] <JZA> so beside selecting the date and having 'getDate' also have a change style in background and also verify that no other day is selected otherwise restore the style.
[15:55:01] <JZA> anyone around?
[15:59:04] <rodorgas> I'm trying to add custom validation for forms in materializecss.com . This lib do its validation calling `window.validate_field($obj)`. I think the best way is to call something like `$obj.custom_validate()` inside `window.validate_field, but it seems that I can't assign function to object instances. Any ideas?
[16:01:00] <rodorgas> I can extend JQuery adding a custom validation function, but I can't change it on object instances. It needs to be different for each form input object
[16:01:31] <JZA> hi rodorgasdo you know how to do what I need?
[16:01:46] <JZA> I want to have persistant style change once clicked on a day on the jquery ui datepicker
[16:05:28] <rodorgas> JZA: lookin at https://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/ it doesn't seems too easy, because we don't have any events
[16:06:05] <JZA> I post the question on stackoverflow, the most similar quesiton is this one; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24449323/how-to-change-the-background-color-of-current-day-in-jquery-datepicker-onclick?rq=1
[16:06:23] <JZA> the only issue is that he is asking for 'current-day' which I am not sure is the same as selected-day.
[16:07:16] <rodorgas> current-day is today
[16:07:26] <JZA> althought aparently it works.
[16:07:42] <JZA> actually for the datepicker current-day is whatever you have selected.
[16:07:49] <JZA> .ui-datepicker-current-day
[16:07:53] <JZA> which is what I needed
[16:08:10] <rodorgas> got it
[16:08:24] <rodorgas> does it solve your problem?
[16:09:44] <rodorgas> i'm not sure if you want to change the style of the <input> or the style of something inside that component
[16:10:51] <JZA> https://jsfiddle.net/vum5816p/10/
[16:10:56] <JZA> yeah it does.
[16:11:02] <JZA> there is no input
[16:11:14] <JZA> I am building a touch UI, so is uselsess to have an input,
[16:11:22] <JZA> the widgets just build the json object.

[18:57:16] <wh0ami> hi guys
[18:57:52] <wh0ami> anyone got idea why im getting 'TypeError: $(...).fullCalendar is not a function'? i included jquery before the fullCalendar js
[19:21:13] <wh0ami> anyone got idea why im getting 'TypeError: $(...).fullCalendar is not a function'? i included jquery before the fullCalendar js
[19:22:10] <arc_> impossible to say without knowing what code generated the error
[19:23:31] <arc_> perhaps your selector is not valid
[19:31:12] <shoky> common cause is including jquery multiple times
[19:33:00] <arc_> shoky do you know if a method is expecting to be piped a single div, would it say it's not a function if you select something else, or multiple elements
[19:33:26] <arc_> i don't use any of those plugins so i haven't had experience with that
[19:43:41] <shoky> arc_ i'm having trouble understanding your question.. come again? ;p
[19:44:23] <shoky> especially "would it say it's not a function"  but can't say i really understand the rest either ;p
[19:45:19] <shoky> oh like in that error message
[19:46:19] <shoky> you only get that array when some code is trying to call something as a function when it's not.. usually because it's undefined - for any number of reasons...
[19:46:37] <shoky> s/array/error
[19:46:37] <b-ot> Correction, <shoky> you only get that error when some code is trying to call something as a function when it's not.. usually because it's undefined - for any number of reasons...
[19:53:26] <wh0ami> shoky: jquery its just included 1 time
[20:52:15] <residentmale> quick question, if I'm trying to catch a click event on a table row how can I tell if it's on an anchor element or not
[20:52:59] <residentmale> if I run $(this).prop('nodeName') in the click event it just gives me table cell even if I'm clicking on an anchor
[20:59:07] <shoky> residentmale: you can check event.target (where event is the argument passed to the event handler)
[20:59:20] <snover> (1) using jQuery to do that instead of just literally writing `this.nodeName` is ridiculous, and (2) that thing that shoky just said.
[21:00:20] <residentmale> oh that works thanks
[21:00:42] <residentmale> I get the anchor
[21:00:43] <snover> this/event.currentTarget represents the element the event handler is attached to, and event.target represents the bottom-most element in the DOM tree
[21:01:02] <residentmale> thank you snover/shoky
[21:01:59] <shoky> residentmale: you can also do event delegation, catch only clicks coming from anchors or elements with some class, e.g.  $('table').on('click', '.someclass', function(e)..)
[21:02:13] <shoky> `this` will be the .someclass element
[21:02:53] <residentmale> that's very useful
[21:03:40] <shoky> docs for .on() have more info on that
[21:03:57] <residentmale> I will look at them
[21:25:45] <JZA> hi how can I insert an svg on a <div id="mysvg"></div>
[21:26:49] <arc_> shoky sorry, i asked that because when you try to call a jquery method on something that is not a jquery object, it says "x is not a function"
[21:27:15] <arc_> so i was wondering if it could happen in a situation where it is a jquery object, but that you aren't passing what the plugin is expecting
[21:29:24] <TimCoal> i'm thinking i'd do much better in jquery if i knew what a/the jQuery object actually is
[21:30:29] <TimCoal> and hopefully get a better understanding of what is and isn't one and when and where
[21:30:46] <shoky> arc_: totally depends what the method is doing. if it calls something but its not a function, that error will happen.. so if whatever you pass it causes it to do that... you'll get the error
[21:31:26] <arc_> lol, okay ;)
[21:31:53] <arc_> TimCoal jquery is a "dom abstraction library"
[21:32:17] <arc_> it helps you deal with dom elements by giving you methods that are easier to understand
[21:32:35] <shoky> arc_ re-read what they said ;p
[21:32:42] <TimCoal> quick question, if i'm looking at this.element[0] am i looking at the actual DOM object or some sort of JS wrapper?
[21:32:44] <arc_> a jquery object is simply a set of things that you have selected via jquery
[21:33:05] <arc_> shoky i was getting to that part of the explanation :p
[21:33:47] <shoky> TimCoal: depends what `this` is.. and what this.element is :P   if `this.element` is a jquery object wrapping a DOM element, then yes [0] will get the DOM element
[21:33:57] <shoky> donno what you mean with "some sort of JS wrapper"
[21:34:28] <arc_> i think he's asking how it works at a lower level, that we don't really need to concern ourselves with
[21:34:33] <TimCoal> shoky, i'm proficcent enough in bad-english to get what was intended more-or-less
[21:34:55] <shoky> hm?
[21:35:16] <shoky> anyways, the common case is yea that a jquery object wraps a DOM element
[21:35:19] <TimCoal> arc_ yes, but useful to have an understanding of
[21:35:41] <shoky> it's an array-like object
[21:35:56] <TimCoal> like playing Jazz, learn the rules and forget them
[21:36:04] <TimCoal> ahh cool
[21:36:14] <TimCoal> i need to get down there
[21:36:15] <shoky> each jquery object is really a collection
[21:36:28] <shoky> of 0 or more elements (or sometimes not elements but usually)
[21:37:31] <TimCoal> yea i struggle with the fluidity of JS, but really do appreciate the power of its fluidity
[21:37:45] <shoky> and jquery objects inherit from jQuery.prototype (which is aliased as $.fn) , that's how they get all the jquery methods
[21:37:48] <TimCoal> its a lot like how i naturally work
[21:39:01] <TimCoal> and at the end of the day JQ is just clever JS, which makes me think its still only the beginning
[21:40:40] <TimCoal> when does a JQ object come into being?
[21:41:00] <arc_> it depends, but usually when you $('select') something
[21:41:19] <TimCoal> uh hu
[21:42:01] <TimCoal> its the simplicity of it that trips me up sometimes
[21:43:03] <shoky> $ is a function that returns a new jquery object
[21:43:55] <TimCoal> arc_ that simple and almost obvious answer has removed a lot of question marks
[21:44:18] <TimCoal> right its just a function, simpler again
[21:45:19] <TimCoal> i am very much a less is more man, so i shouldn't be supprised and am in fact quite excited
[21:46:54] <TimCoal> ok right and it goes away once its no longer referenced or specifcally distroyed
[21:48:36] <TimCoal> tagging on to a DOM element, to preserve an instance? [which actually sounds like a bad idea, all you need is state, unless its a complicated object]
[21:49:56] <TimCoal> ahh $.fn is jQuery.prototype, that makes a lot of sense
[21:50:23] <TimCoal> right thats clicked something
[21:56:04] <TimCoal> yea my question about the this.element[0] being the actual DOM object or a JS object[assuming the DOM is outside of JS].  my specific question mark is ...
[21:56:41] <JZA> hi how can I insert an svg on a <div id="mysvg"></div>
[21:56:52] <TimCoal> when you tag somthing on to an elememt, is that being attached to the actual object in the dom
[21:57:27] <TimCoal> have you googled it JZA?
[21:57:49] <JZA> yeah but I dont get it, they offer way too many options, as inline, embeded and such.
[21:58:01] <JZA> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18846253/how-do-i-create-html-table-using-jquery-dynamically
[21:58:06] <JZA> oops wrong link
[21:58:13] <JZA> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35783441/include-svg-files-with-html-and-still-be-able-to-apply-styles-to-them
[21:58:22] <JZA> I end up more confused. :)
[21:58:45] <JZA> also they wrote the SVG, I already have an external SVG that I want JS to load.
[21:58:45] <TimCoal> confusion is the path to understanding
[21:59:21] <TimCoal> been down it many times
[21:59:30] <JZA> TimCoal: right, and a chat might help me get there faster.
[21:59:41] <JZA> at least thats what I hope
[22:00:15] <JZA> so first question on that example, they use this line: var e, threeElmts = document.querySelectorAll(elmtType);
[22:00:28] <JZA> but not really sure where is it selecting since the HTML doesnt really have an id/class
[22:01:29] <JZA> so first question is how do I load the SVG to JS.
[22:01:38] <JZA> none of that code actually invoke it.
[22:01:50] <JZA> it just manipulate the img tag
[22:02:34] <JZA> also has a click event which seems a bit irrelevant, if the only thing I need is to load the SVG (the original question doestn event need a click)
[22:02:43] <JZA> it seems this was copy-pasted from some tutorial doing something else.
[22:02:54] <JZA> so in conclusion, this is pretty useless and missleading.
[22:03:31] <TimCoal> how would you put it on the page manually?
[22:03:32] <JZA> so again, how do I insert an svg to a div/class="mysvg"
[22:04:13] <JZA> copy-pasting the whole svg xml output.
[22:04:19] <TimCoal> yes, to be fair there are a ton of results on that search
[22:04:40] <TimCoal> so can you append that to a div?
[22:06:25] <JZA> how do I do that?
[22:06:40] <TimCoal> there might be more elegant ways, but something that works over nothing is a good place to start
[22:07:30] <JZA> I would expect, creating an SVG object, loading it with the svg file, and once I have that declared, then proceed to append it to the DIV tag.
[22:08:15] <JZA> similar to how XMLs are worked on
[22:08:18] <TimCoal> $("#content").append($("<whatever html you need to put on the page goes here[must start with a '<' to be recognised as HTML]>")
[22:08:29] <TimCoal> )
[22:08:36] <TimCoal> ;
[22:09:22] <JZA> can I append the file?
[22:10:00] <TimCoal> i don't know too much about SVG
[22:10:10] <TimCoal> you can try and see
[22:10:31] <TimCoal> simple test cases help
[22:10:36] <JZA> the SVG is very lengty like 54 lines
[22:10:52] <JZA> svg is an xml in a txt file.
[22:11:25] <JZA> also outputing <whatever html you need....> might cause issues like broken tags
[22:11:44] <JZA> thats why I thought an object would be more useful.
[22:13:06] <TimCoal> http://keith-wood.name/svg.html  not sure if thats overkill
[22:13:06] <JZA> thats why I would think it should be handled like an XML more than a raw string.
[22:23:31] <JZA> this is kind of what I want but programtically: https://jsfiddle.net/76on2bmk/
[22:23:36] <JZA> here is all HTML
[22:24:16] <JZA> so I need some Javascript to turn a JSON into a table + how to operate the dom to insert the svg file + a tutorial on how to dynamically insert custom styles to particular SVG
[22:25:39] <JZA> also this is a URL which is great, but not for me since I cant really replace the color of the SVG if its occupied.
[22:39:13] <TimCoal> ok
[22:39:20] <TimCoal> can you do loops?
[22:39:31] <arc_> yes
[22:40:10] <arc_> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while
[22:45:52] <TimCoal> https://jsfiddle.net/qns8gcpm/
[22:50:17] <JZA> cool can we have it in a loop..
[22:50:48] <JZA> something like this: $("seat").append('<div class="row">').ForEach(4) {
[22:51:09] <TimCoal> of course :)
[22:51:28] <arc_> TimCoal that isn't working how you think it is
[22:51:34] <TimCoal> that gives you the tool to build whatever you need
[22:51:47] <arc_> if you look at the html, you can see that all of those images are in the same div
[22:51:50] <TimCoal> how do you think i think it is?
[22:52:31] <arc_> normally if you select '.row' whatever method you use would apply to all elements sharing that class
[22:52:44] <arc_> but append is special in that it only creates one element each time you call it
[22:52:53] <TimCoal> arc_ as per the example https://jsfiddle.net/76on2bmk/
[22:53:41] <TimCoal> it seems to apply it to each selected element
[22:53:50] <JZA> this is my stupid protype..
[22:53:56] <JZA> https://jsfiddle.net/qns8gcpm/1/
[22:54:15] <JZA> oops.. https://jsfiddle.net/qns8gcpm/2/
[22:54:40] <arc_> TimCoal i don't understand what you're showing me with this second fiddle
[22:54:41] <JZA> I know I am making pleny of mistakes.
[22:55:40] <arc_> oh, i see. nevermind then
[22:57:30] <TimCoal> arc_ its what JZA is trying to achieve in code
[22:57:32] <TimCoal> JZA is the for statement correct?
[22:57:49] <TimCoal> thanks for looking arc_ :)
[22:58:02] <JZA> TimCoal: no thatas what I am trying to fix.
[22:58:46] <JZA> I thought doing a for ($i = 0; $i < my_variable; i++) {  $('class').append(HTML) would be enough.
[22:59:40] <TimCoal> https://api.jquery.com/each/
[23:00:08] <TimCoal> yes but you have mixed it with jquery
[23:00:39] <TimCoal> you can do it with a straight JS for loop or a jquery .each function
[23:02:39] <JZA> ok got this but still not working: https://jsfiddle.net/qns8gcpm/5/
[23:02:51] <D-rex> jza is that what you were trying to accompish? https://jsfiddle.net/qns8gcpm/4/
[23:04:00] <JZA> sort of.. except it was originally 4x4
[23:04:17] <JZA> but yeah, almost there.
[23:05:38] <TimCoal> https://jsfiddle.net/ug2zv092/ now you just need a simple for loop for seats per row
[23:06:20] <TimCoal> all though thats not right either
[23:06:29] <arc_> https://jsfiddle.net/qns8gcpm/6/
[23:08:13] <JZA> excellent.
[23:10:51] <arc_> apparently if you append to a jquery object that has multiple elements, it will work as expected, but if you try to append in a for loop, it will simply move one element over and over again. so you will end up with one element in the last place that you wanted to append to
[23:11:01] <arc_> that's why you need clone()
[23:12:00] <TimCoal> https://jsfiddle.net/1akg3vy2/
[23:12:15] <TimCoal> it needed seperating out
[23:12:53] <arc_> i don't understand why that is working for you
[23:13:18] <TimCoal> i ask nicely
[23:13:21] <arc_> i guess because you are typing it out as text instead of building an element that will be referenced as a jquery object
[23:13:33] <arc_> as a string*
[23:14:25] <arc_> i prefer to build it with jquery methods instead of typing it as a long html string. it's easier to read and modify
[23:14:29] <JZA> one more question, how can I add additonal attributes
[23:14:38] <arc_> what do you mean, exactly
[23:14:40] <JZA> I dont want to the CSS to point to the img tag, but insert a class.
[23:14:56] <TimCoal> yes i was going to go on to suggest that but kept it simple for the moment
[23:14:58] <arc_> sorry, can you rephrase that
[23:14:59] <JZA> var seat = $('<img>').attr('src', 'http://alexandro.biz/assets/img/seat.svg'); + attr('class', 'seat');
[23:15:15] <arc_> you can just do .attr again
[23:15:22] <JZA> arc_: ah ok thanks
[23:15:24] <arc_> but you don't use attr to add a class. you use addClass()
[23:15:54] <TimCoal> exactly
[23:15:54] <TimCoal> arc_ he's ahead of us
[23:16:06] <arc_> did you miss this [23:06:32] <arc_> https://jsfiddle.net/qns8gcpm/6/
[23:16:16] <arc_> he's building on my example :p
[23:16:26] <JZA> arc_: if I do it again it rewrite the variable..
[23:16:32] <JZA> is there a way to concatenate
[23:16:40] <JZA> or pipe it
[23:16:48] <arc_> JZA like i said, you use .addClass() to add a class anyway
[23:16:56] <JZA> ah ok
[23:18:49] <arc_> https://jsfiddle.net/g5jpL4jw/
[23:18:54] <arc_> this seems to work fine for adding multiple attributes
[23:19:01] <arc_> you're not going to need to do that very often, but it works
[23:19:36] <arc_> btw, do not set css like that, it was just an example :p
[23:19:48] <arc_> i couldn't think of other attributes that apply to div
[23:22:16] <TimCoal> $("<a></a>").addClass("myclass").prop("href", "http://jsfiddle.net").prop("id", "myid").mouseover(function(event){ ... });
[23:22:51] <JZA> damn
[23:22:52] <arc_> don't use .mouseover() just use .on('mouseover'
[23:23:01] <JZA> tried this: $(seat).addClass('.seat')
[23:23:03] <JZA> but didnt work
[23:23:06] <JZA> but I will do that.
[23:23:13] <arc_> JZA you don't type the .
[23:23:23] <arc_> that's not part of the class name, that's how you denote that you want to select a class
[23:23:40] <TimCoal> or the " "
[23:23:40] <arc_> you want to add the class 'seat' which is selected by typing $('.seat')
[23:24:07] <arc_> also you don't need to do $(seat) because seat is a variable. you can just do seat.addClass('seat');
[23:24:29] <TimCoal> what are you truing to select? if its not already a seat class
[23:24:40] <arc_> well, it depends i guess. but i was assuming you were looking at the fiddle i pasted
[23:24:54] <JZA> TimCoal: what you mean? the CSS seat class is the seat
[23:27:11] <TimCoal> i'm reading that you are selecting on seat and applying the class seat, if it doesn't already have a seat class, then it wont find it and if it does doesn't need the class again
[23:28:01] <arc_> you're misreading his selector
[23:28:11] <TimCoal> possibly
[23:28:13] <arc_> $('.seat') would select the class
[23:28:30] <TimCoal> ahh its a variable, but hasn't been decalred
[23:28:37] <arc_> i believe he's working on the fiddle i pasted, where i have a variable called that
[23:28:47] <TimCoal> ahh let me look
[23:31:37] <TimCoal> i'm with you
[23:40:54] <arc_> https://jsfiddle.net/qns8gcpm/7/ :p
[23:40:56] <arc_> i must be really bored
[23:41:24] <JZA> ok now I have another issue
[23:41:45] <arc_> what is it
[23:42:09] <JZA> seems that having an SVG linekd is useless to modify styles, if I need to have it change colors for exmaple, on mouse over. I would need to make it so the SVG is appened inline of the <div class="seat"> tag.
[23:42:24] <JZA> I found this SO about it using XHR http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14068031/embedding-external-svg-in-html-for-javascript-manipulation
[23:43:03] <JZA> basically it does what I was looking for xhr.open("GET", "path/to/file.svg", false);... xhr.overrideMimeType("image/svg+xml");
[23:43:15] <arc_> umm.. it's gonna be a lot easier to just make another svg that's red
[23:45:06] <JZA> according to this is only 4 lines.
[23:45:33] <JZA> but sure, I guess doing a conditional and load dynamically the blue vs red svg might do the trick
[23:45:56] <JZA> or i can add the functionality in the SVG
[23:46:41] <arc_> you're on your own if you want to change what an svg looks like via css ;)
[23:46:43] <arc_> i have no idea
[23:46:57] <arc_> also i honestly had no idea i was even working on a question you had, i thought this was just theoretical
[23:47:09] <arc_> i never saw your initial question :p
[23:47:51] <JZA> lol, well is a select of seats, it will be feed by a json (or database) and will show the available seats in the room.
[23:48:10] <JZA> is like a cinema point of sales.
[23:48:19] <JZA> where you select your seat and you can see which one is available.
[23:48:47] <JZA> in HTML it would just be a stupid checkbox form with the name of the seats.
[23:49:06] <JZA> but since it would be a touch interface, I need to make it graphical and scalable.
[23:51:19] <TimCoal> is this real world or a project?
[23:51:35] <JZA> real world, but this is just a 'demo'
[23:51:54] <JZA> like a prototype of the app
[23:52:20] <TimCoal> you doing the backend?
[23:52:47] <JZA> yep
[23:53:02] <JZA> as you can see, I have no idea bout frontend/js/jquery
[23:53:19] <JZA> but I thought I could at least do a rough gui 3 part form.
[23:54:16] <JZA> those blue seats are not going to blow away anyone
