[00:01:13] <TeddyMurray> robertmaxrees, can i message you unrelated to jquery?
[00:01:26] <robertmaxrees> sure
[02:14:18] <hellyeah> hey
[02:14:29] <hellyeah> can you help me to figure out why it isnt working?
[02:15:09] <hellyeah> ah
[02:15:19] <hellyeah> it is about jquery version
[02:15:20] <Woet> yea line 38 is missing a comma
[02:15:21] <Woet> good luck
[02:15:27] <hellyeah> what a shame
[02:15:39] <hellyeah> ÅŸ am using jquery 2.2.4 and it works now
[02:15:54] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/vnde3pzo/4/
[05:30:01] <jlkd3> How do I make the checkbox work while allowing the text to also check the box without changing the html? https://jsfiddle.net/Lq45waax/
[05:46:08] <Archelaus> Anyone have any clue why an animation on body,html on the scrollTop property is slow *only on ios*
[05:46:16] <Archelaus> It's insanely jerky
[05:47:09] <Archelaus> It's purely a call to $('html, body').animate({scrollTop:target_scroll}, 1000, 'linear'); - I've tried other settings such as 'swing' and 'slow'
[05:56:12] <Cork> jlkd3: why not just make the span a label...
[05:56:19] <Cork> using js for that is kinda icky...
[05:57:02] <Cork> Archelaus: cause it needs to sync the two threads used (js and rendering) in order for it to work
[05:57:17] <Archelaus> Cork I'm not really sure how that answer helps me
[05:57:28] <jlkd3> Cork: haters gon hate
[05:57:38] <jlkd3> it's actually generated by a third party script
[05:57:45] <Cork> Archelaus: it is the same for all browsers that use async scrolling to make things smooth when scrolling
[05:57:56] <Cork> Archelaus: what you see is the actual speed of the device
[05:58:11] <jlkd3> the chef has managed to cook up a solution
[05:58:19] <Cork> jlkd3: so just replace the span with a label or warp it all in it
[05:58:55] <Cork> $('span').wrap('label') *kinda*
[05:59:05] <jlkd3> Cork: yes that's what I did
[05:59:21] <jlkd3> well, not exactly that but used jquery to manipulate the form, thank you for holding my hand
[05:59:27] <Cork> Archelaus: there are work in the csswg to add support for animating scroll positions
[05:59:33] <Cork> and those are async
[06:00:41] <Cork> Archelaus: ex. the behavior in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView
[06:01:04] <Cork> but ya, currently i don't know of a way to get that to run well on low power devices
[06:01:14] <Cork> (as the api features doesn't exist)
[06:02:58] <momomo> Hi there. I've a got job application test. It's pretty simple. I am supposes to make this in nice html and css: https://i.imgur.com/Zfc3nLD.png
[06:02:58] <momomo> Using only css3 and html
[06:02:58] <momomo> how should I structure the elements 
[06:02:58] <momomo> this is what I have .. but i am not sure if I should be using flex or not ... and how to group the elements  for the best result
[06:02:59] <momomo> https://hastebin.com/xikotoxaro.xml
[06:03:19] <momomo> i know maybe not jquery related but everyone is asleep on irc as of know on web
[06:03:35] <momomo> 1. am I overusing section?
[06:03:55] <momomo> 2. should I create two structures ... one for the top and one for the bottom and place sub sections in them ?
[06:05:13] <undefined_bob> how does your search.js work?
[06:05:41] <undefined_bob> sorry not related to your questions, I'm just curious
[06:06:02] <momomo> undefined_bob: it's just a simple search and select a thing .. then add it to the bottom list
[06:06:04] <momomo> basically
[06:06:28] <undefined_bob> in addition with something like a mysql db?
[06:06:39] <momomo> i am just not sure what the "BEST" way of structuring the document is and if the best way to place things is using flex ... it should be responsive as well
[06:06:46] <momomo> or just using padding-top
[06:06:56] <momomo> undefined_bob: well .. the api is not that important
[06:06:59] <undefined_bob> I would use flex
[06:07:06] <momomo> ok .. and the element structure ?
[06:07:16] <undefined_bob> you can also ask in #css
[06:07:19] <momomo> as  I have defined or <section top> ... <sectioN bottom
[06:07:22] <momomo> no answers
[06:07:31] <momomo> or three sections as I have now
[06:07:51] <momomo> and is main element correctly used now ?
[06:11:09] <momomo> is it possible to use background to url(...svg) .. and set the fill color ? i can't seem to be able to change the paths fill color
[06:11:14] <momomo> i need to target a nested g ... but the svg is not in the html document
[06:11:23] <momomo> only refered to as a url in the css
[06:12:21] <undefined_bob> <main> should really wrap around the real main content
[06:13:07] <momomo> undefined_bob: which is in this case?
[06:13:15] <momomo> not the results ?
[06:13:29] <undefined_bob> I am torn apart if logo and search belong to that
[06:13:55] <undefined_bob> but I havent used that tag by now
[06:14:42] <momomo> undefined_bob: ok, thanks for helping through the analysis though
[06:14:45] <momomo> i am getting closer
[06:16:22] <undefined_bob> I would wrap the main only about the results
[06:16:31] <undefined_bob> not around search and logo
[06:17:31] <undefined_bob> do you really need to use a svg for background or can you do it with css too?
[06:18:00] <undefined_bob> can you specify your struggle with the sections a bit more?
[06:21:23] <momomo> as of now, the main struggle is how to get the correct padding between the elements (vertically), should I be using padding:2vh, or should I flex?
[06:33:21] <undefined_bob> I'm always for flex, momomo
[06:36:00] <momomo> here is an update with the css as well: http://jsbin.com/xoyixadago/2/edit?html,css,output

[12:44:00] <pippuccio76> HI at all , Is there a way to call an ajax request  ( the same ) by change one of two fields ? see https://fiddle.jshell.net/3g7jwppm/ i want on $("#id_class_quantita1").keyup or  on id_prodotto1.change
[12:46:31] <taplar> just extract the ajax into a named method and use that method in both of your event handlers.
[12:50:26] <pippuccio76> taplar : is it ok : https://fiddle.jshell.net/3g7jwppm/1/ ?
[12:51:29] <taplar> https://fiddle.jshell.net/3g7jwppm/2/  small change, but yeah
[12:51:55] <taplar> also you may want to change 'keyup' to 'input'
[12:52:11] <taplar> keyup would fire for all keys, like arrow keys.  where as input fires just for things that change the value
[12:57:59] <pippuccio76> tank taplar
[12:58:10] <taplar> i tank every day
[12:58:44] <pippuccio76> :) tank you
[12:59:19] <pippuccio76> sorry thank
[12:59:27] <taplar> i gotcha.  i was just messing around
[13:32:21] <pippuccio76> taplar , sorry but why regalo is always 0 ? https://fiddle.jshell.net/3g7jwppm/3/
[13:32:48] <taplar> jQuery objects do not directly expose dom properties
[13:32:56] <taplar> you'll want to use .prop('checked')
[13:36:08] <pippuccio76> ;-)
[17:09:21] <skinux> I've asked this before, but didn't ever have a clear understanding. I'm working on an application resembling a near-spreadsheet appearance. It is a job application logger/tracker. Variable amount of rows to display/edit common details related to job information, including status of job application. Probably a couple months ago it was suggested to use ReactJS, however, that is really seeming to be over-kill and complicated (especially since it's meant
[17:09:23] <skinux> for large applications). So, I'm wondering if it really could be developed rather simply with jQuery?
[17:10:15] <taplar> spreadsheet like, so tabular data?
[17:18:32] <irssi> how to select current row inside jsrender for

[19:47:18] <Darmani> Hi everyone!

[20:01:47] <Darmani> nvm I got it
[20:02:41] <Guest53972> umm

[21:53:14] <jak2000> hi all
[21:53:23] <jak2000> anoyone used the plugin datatable?
[22:18:33] <jak2000> wich is the best method for edit data in an html table?
[22:36:24] <TeddyMurray> https://workfar.com/dashboard#profile when you open the dialog box more than once it adds a new form to the end of it, or sometimes theres an extra empty dialog box. any ideas?
[22:36:28] <TeddyMurray> need to login to see
[22:36:51] <TeddyMurray> does dialog("close") destroy the DOM object?
[23:18:38] <evanesoteric> Can anyone recommend a good slideout system? Modern and maintained.
[23:22:00] <Woet> you need a "system" for that?
