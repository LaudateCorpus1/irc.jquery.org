[00:17:52] <foo> Can someone review these 7 lines? https://paste.ofcode.org/yiVp57FqDm3HL2k4d98Lv7 - intention is to show an error message. I'm wondering if there's a better alternative to if (!$field.parent().find('.error-message').length) {
[04:22:07] <baako> hi guys, I have a alot of checkboxes on my view. and when you click on select all, it will select everything. However, I want to make the last select option, unselectable regardless if you click on it. How can I do this please? https://kopy.io/khg0W
[04:23:29] <Cork> "unselectable"??
[04:23:44] <baako> uncheckable*
[04:24:24] <Cork> so you basically want an uncheck button?
[04:24:34] <Cork> (hint hing)
[04:24:37] <Cork> *t
[04:25:16] <baako> Cork: on my view, the checkbox appears regardless for each rows
[04:25:46] <baako> maybe the best way is to prevent the checkbox from showing for the last row
[04:26:17] <Cork> sounds like you expect us to know something specific to your page without showing it
[04:26:48] <baako> Cork: sorry let me explain. so am generated a table using a php foreach loop
[04:27:08] <baako> each table row has checkbox
[04:27:19] <Cork> if you want help with rendering problem show the rendering (ex jsfiddle.net) don't describe it
[04:27:47] <baako> then on top of the table itself the is a master checkbox and when you click on it, it checks all the other checkboxes
[08:12:46] <robertparkerx> is keyCode x32 the number 2
[08:17:39] <Cork> depends on the keyboard
[08:18:12] <Cork> keyCode explicitly means keyboard key with the code
[08:18:30] <Cork> for example 2 on the num key and 2 on the normal key is different
[08:18:57] <robertparkerx> I see
[10:11:34] <Paradisee> hello
[10:11:44] <Paradisee> anybody can help me with web components?
[10:21:51] <Cork> Paradisee: ask your question not for someone, else you most likely won't get any answars at all
[10:22:09] <Paradisee> since it is #jquery
[10:22:18] <Paradisee> won't ask a question that won't be answered :D
[10:22:25] <Paradisee> anyway
[10:22:31] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/3RJQA0H
[10:22:45] <Paradisee> i'm trying to make a parallax, but the image it's kinda freezy
[10:22:46] <Cork> well if you know it isn't ontopic for the channel then ya, don't ask it
[10:24:22] <Cork> ya, scroll events are delayed
[10:24:36] <Cork> it isn't on main thread live triggered by the browser
[10:24:40] <Cork> so they will lag
[10:24:52] <Paradisee> but why then other plugins are not delayed?
[10:25:07] <Cork> most don't use scroll now days
[10:25:08] <Paradisee> i've used simple-parallax-js too
[10:25:40] <Paradisee> what can i do then
[10:27:11] <Cork> well you can use @keyframe and css3 to get quite a bit
[10:27:28] <Cork> there is also a new animationworker or something don't remember
[10:27:47] <Cork> that get a small amount of execution time to do on scroll calculations if i remember correctly
[10:28:09] <Cork> also the precision of scroll events depends on how the page is constructed
[10:28:27] <Cork> though i haven't needed to care enough to remember exactly what the rules was
[10:29:02] <Paradisee> so without using an on scroll listener?
[10:29:53] <Cork> you would have to dig closer into it, i don't remember
[10:30:14] <Cork> but the problem is that scroll events is executed by a different process then the one doing the scrolling
[10:30:35] <Cork> so you will always have quite significant desyncs
[10:31:07] <Paradisee> apart the desync the image freeze aswell
[10:31:31] <Cork> donno the cause for that, might be js execution takes a long time
[10:31:39] <Cork> as ui updates halt while js runs
[10:31:46] <taplar> you should also cache those selectors in the scroll handler.
[10:31:54] <taplar> repeated lookups for a scroll event === bad
[10:32:13] <Cork> thoguht it is a hashtable lookup as it is just a class selector
[10:32:15] <Cork> but ya
[10:32:30] <taplar> still making a new jquery object every time
[10:32:59] <Cork> that is mostely just a little gc though
[10:33:14] <Paradisee> don't know how to solve
[10:33:21] <Cork> it is the same amount of gc as obj.find() or obj.children() does
[10:34:34] <taplar> possibly small, but given that it's scroll and the logic doesn't appear to be debouncing or throttling, making that happen less i'd say is always a good idea
[10:34:34] <Paradisee> the delay is "almost ok"....
[10:34:43] <Paradisee> but the image keep freezing when moved
[10:34:51] <Paradisee> it is so ugly
[10:35:31] <Paradisee> if you scroll just one tick, it moves from 0 to 100 for example
[10:35:38] <Cork> ya, you will have to look at js execution times and find where your cost comes from
[10:35:38] <Paradisee> another tick from 200 to 300
[10:35:55] <Cork> and get them out of the hotpath of the animatio
[10:35:57] <Cork> +n
[10:36:04] <Paradisee> instead i would like to send an animation to 100 and 200
[10:36:19] <Paradisee> it will make it smooth
[10:36:35] <Paradisee> from 100 to 200*
[10:37:12] <Paradisee> and in case if another scroll event is fired, stop the previous and run the next from where it was to 300
[10:37:17] <Cork> Paradisee: the delay isn't cause the browser wants to make your animation look bad
[10:37:19] <Paradisee> well, that's the idea
[10:37:24] <Cork> it is cause your doing to much in the hot path
[10:37:49] <Paradisee> but i'm not doing much
[10:37:54] <Paradisee> you saw the code
[10:38:10] <Cork> ya, but i can't benchmarke a paste
[10:40:47] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/1DH9TVH
[10:40:57] <Paradisee> that's the time it takes the function to execute
[10:42:30] <Paradisee> for me the execution time doesn't look a problem
[10:42:48] <Paradisee> it is more related on how the animation is fired
[10:43:11] <Paradisee> depending on the scroll it snap on the position based on the top
[10:43:28] <Paradisee> but i don't get how i could make it smooth
[10:45:00] <Cork> hmm wait a minute... i think scrollTop fires a reflow of the page doesn't it?
[10:45:20] <Cork> if you do that on each scroll step you would cause a lot of extra work for the browser
[10:46:55] <Paradisee> well, i don't really know
[10:47:24] <Paradisee> https://www.raicultura.it/
[10:47:43] <Paradisee> the code i'm using is almost similar to this one
[10:48:46] <Paradisee> but it does not use web components
[11:19:20] <Paradisee> ideas?
[12:23:12] <agile_prg> gods of jquery very confused about this, I have hashAlarms = {}; var objCard = $(key).closest('.card');  hashAlarms[objCard] = hashAlarm; when I try for (var objCard2 in hashAlarms) { console.log("_dbg2 card class attr: " + objCard2.attr('class')); I get Uncaught type error: objCard.attr is not a function
[12:23:30] <agile_prg> it will will prior to assigning to hashAlarm as a key however
[12:23:38] <agile_prg> will work
[12:26:59] <Cork> agile_prg: you can't use jquery objects as keys
[12:27:09] <agile_prg> oh oops, why?
[12:27:16] <Cork> cause every time you call jquery the object will be different
[12:27:23] <Cork> you can use the raw dom element though
[12:27:26] <agile_prg> ok, I heart you
[12:27:30] <Cork> so objCard[0]
[12:28:39] <Cork> also if you need more help, create some online store of the code, cause reading in irc is horrible when it is more then very short
[12:28:49] <Cork> (ex jsfiddle.net)
[12:32:22] <dimi1947> is there an easy and fast way to check the existence of an element in the DOM with jquery?
[12:35:12] <taplar> $(selector).length > 0
[15:18:50] <jak2000> returned
[15:19:03] <jak2000> taplar, the trick of my selectpicker is set: selectOnTab to true right?
[15:27:52] <taplar> is this related to the preventing enter from closing the modal?
[15:45:57] <jak2000> not...is for 'detect' enter key in a selectpicker
[15:46:04] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/uwr81Ltz/2/
[15:49:47] <taplar> ok, well i'm not sure if the selectOnTab will do it or not.  it may.  i only linked the api reference yesterday as a starting point for experimentations
