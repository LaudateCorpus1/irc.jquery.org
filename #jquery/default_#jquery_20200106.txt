[07:27:24] <primitivMedia> having issues with this code not working
[07:29:00] <primitivMedia> it gets stuck inside my if statement
[07:29:02] <primitivMedia> and wont fire it twice
[08:17:04] <codecutter> why is $.ajax error block called if the server returns a null value?
[08:21:11] <codecutter> nvm
[12:16:41] <ckb> hey guys, how do I execute something after images are loaded?
[12:17:01] <robertmaxrees> ckb depends - could you elaborate a bit more about what you're doing? :)
[12:19:35] <makr8100> $('#containerDiv').on('load', 'img', function() { $(this).addClass('loaded'); } );
[12:19:48] <robertmaxrees> :/ that doesn't really answer my question/.
[12:20:06] <makr8100> $('#containerDiv').on('load', 'img', function() { doSomething(this); } );
[12:20:18] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to implement lazy loading and want some kind of loading placeholder until the image is loaded?
[12:20:32] <makr8100> I was just answering the question as generically as it was asked P:
[12:21:14] <robertmaxrees> makr8100 sadly, that solution won't work :/
[12:22:42] <makr8100> I obviously didn't test or debug it lol...  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3877027/jquery-callback-on-image-load-even-when-the-image-is-cached
[12:23:02] <robertmaxrees> the load event doesn't properly bubble.
[12:23:26] <robertmaxrees> depending on the "why" behind this request, it may be best to just use a lazy loading image lib.
[12:23:55] <makr8100> heh, I've never had to try that so idk.  also true, the "why" does usually get better/more relevant answers
[12:24:07] <robertmaxrees> yep :)
[12:29:29] <ckb> hey robertmaxrees, thanks for the response.... now I'm using HandlebarsJS as well.... how can I guarentee it executes this after the LAST img? or do you think that really matters?
[12:29:45] <robertmaxrees> you still haven't really answered my question :/
[12:29:51] <robertmaxrees> why do you think you need that?
[12:36:39] <robertmaxrees> ckb...
[12:40:09] <ckb> robertmaxrees, sorry a bit busy... the problem is I'm creating a messages app (VoIP company) and I want the standard scroll to bottom when the page loads (or the template gets inserted, etc)
[12:40:48] <ckb> naturally the conversation would flow downwards (but the images [when loaded] will change the scrollTop)
[12:41:06] <ckb> err scrollHeight, I apologize
[12:41:52] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.  if they're apart of the initial payload for the page, then you want to bind to the window's load event.
[12:42:17] <ckb> robertmaxrees, that's what I was asking about... what if the image comes in after window.log?
[12:42:19] <ckb> load**
[12:43:06] <ckb> the initial payload is fine, but dynamically between conversations still has the same problem. just trying to find a solution for both
[12:43:09] <robertmaxrees> then you're in a bit of a pickle  - you'd need to create the image tag, bind the handler to it, then set the source and append to the document.
[12:43:32] <ckb> I'm thinking I might just want to preload the images using JS
[12:43:44] <robertmaxrees> there's a smarter way fwiw.
[12:43:52] <ckb> I'm listening
[12:44:27] <robertmaxrees> could set a static height for inline image previews, set that height on the tag itself, and not worry about the images loading or not.
[12:44:41] <ckb> I hear you here...
[12:44:49] <ckb> and just crop horizontally?
[12:45:02] <robertmaxrees> scale down in general.
[12:45:04] <ckb> what if an image has a height < (lets just say 100px)
[12:45:07] <robertmaxrees> just make the height fit.
[12:45:28] <robertmaxrees> if you try to "overshoot" the scoll, it'll just go to the bottom.
[12:46:18] <ckb> so just make the img tag a static 100px high and if they upload a 100x1000 picture it'll just be 1px high in the 100px img container?
[12:46:33] <ckb> errr I hope you understood what I meant there
[12:46:35] <robertmaxrees> oir use max-height
[12:46:38] <robertmaxrees> *or
[12:46:42] <robertmaxrees> max-height: 100px;
[12:46:58] <robertmaxrees> something like htat.
[12:47:05] <robertmaxrees> i'd experiment around w/ it.
[12:47:14] <ckb> AH... then just use math to calculate the # of images and add that to scrollTop?
[12:47:20] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[12:47:34] <ckb> nice.... thanks for the input. you've always been super helpful
[13:36:08] <ckb> hey robertmaxrees any idea what the issue is with iOS and taking a photo vs uploading the photo?
[13:36:19] <robertmaxrees> i don't use iod.
[13:36:21] <robertmaxrees> *ios
[13:36:24] <ckb> :(
[13:36:29] <robertmaxrees> so no.  mind providing some more context?
[13:37:36] <ckb> well, I can select a photo (for MMS with VoIP here) and it will upload and send via Bandwidth properly, but if I try to take a picture and send it, it will only show the preview from ReadFile() but not upload the file
[13:38:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah dunno.  sounds like a non-jquery issue.
[13:38:24] <ckb> yeah, figured I'd ask... any which way you can point me?
[13:38:33] <robertmaxrees> google :)
[13:39:27] <ckb> ah... I think it's just a "capture" attribute
[13:51:03] <ckb> update: was just max file upload size
[14:25:25] <csplugins> Hello, I have a polling ajax request that will animate a pulse affect after receiving a response. It works but the issue is the animation pauses if I switch to another tab and then come back to the original one. The animation then continues with all the queued up responses. How would I ensure the .animate() function does not pause when I leave a
[14:25:25] <csplugins> tab and return at a later point?

[14:34:08] <littlebit> hi people, i have a $("#table tr") selecteion where I get all the rows of a table. is there a way how to select only the first column of a table?
[14:34:45] <robertmaxrees> littlebit sure - use .filter()
[14:35:33] <robertmaxrees> littlebitq even better though - make your server render those TDs with a descriptive class.
[14:37:17] <littlebit> robertmaxrees: can I chain the filters?
[14:37:27] <robertmaxrees> sure, though you shouldn't need to?
[14:37:36] <littlebit> robertmaxrees: y?
[14:37:48] <robertmaxrees> erm, why would you need to?
[14:39:14] <robertmaxrees> like: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tL3jno7e/
[14:39:16] <robertmaxrees> 1 step :)
[14:41:09] <littlebit> robertmaxrees: great thx
[19:04:20] <SaraDR> Hi humanoids. Noob question, how do I select, on an element already coming from jquery? eg. $( this ).parent() .. and from this, select all children.
[19:04:48] <robertmaxrees> .parent() returns a jquery object, so all jquery methods will work.
[19:04:55] <robertmaxrees> eg .parent().find('*')
[19:05:20] <robertmaxrees> SaraDR
[19:06:28] <SaraDR> Awesome. Thanks a ton robertmaxrees. Works perfect.
[19:08:29] <SaraDR> robertmaxrees, does this look fine, or am I missing something obvious, in the jquery approach? $(this).parent().find('.two').css('backgroundColor', '#ffffff');
[19:09:07] <robertmaxrees> not sure i follow the question.
[19:09:15] <robertmaxrees> is it not nothing something you're expecting?
[19:10:32] <robertmaxrees> also: it's background-color, not backgroundColor
[19:10:50] <robertmaxrees> also also: avoid .parent() - use .closest() and pass a selector for the element you can about instead.
[19:11:47] <SaraDR> Thanks. I'll read about that :)
