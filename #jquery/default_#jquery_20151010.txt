[00:38:52] <muranjan> How to know details of $(this) inside a button click function in Jqery??
[00:39:19] <muranjan> it alerts only [object Objet]
[01:36:11] <arc_> what's your code
[01:36:16] <arc_> nevermind it's been an hour
[02:16:25] <pokergod> which advanced javascript book would you guys recommend
[04:22:58] <OnceMe> hello
[05:47:45] <rindolf> Hi all.
[05:59:00] <lalalaaa> Hi! I have this dropdown menu here which uses JS to wrap items in column divs based on height of the screen: http://jsfiddle.net/cwwpgfy3/
[05:59:03] <lalalaaa> Nowadays, could such a setup be simplified with flexbox or what have you?

[07:05:58] <absklb> I am trying to use this vimeo api js https://f.vimeocdn.com/js/froogaloop2.min.js and i get error that d[f] is not definedd? is it an error from their js or something wrong in my side?

[10:35:40] <fas3r> hello
[10:35:53] <fas3r> can I put an id on a link and script ?
[10:36:06] <fas3r> *section/element
[10:46:39] <rindolf> fas3r: hi.
[10:46:49] <fas3r> rindolf: hello
[10:47:19] <rindolf> fas3r: see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/347798/changing-an-elements-id-with-jquery
[10:47:37] <rindolf> fas3r: .attr("id", "NewId")
[10:48:16] <fas3r> rindolf: sorry I did not be clear i think. is it possible to set a class or an id on <link> and <script> ?
[10:48:35] <rindolf> fas3r: I think so.
[10:48:40] <fas3r> I was not clear* .. :)
[10:48:45] <rindolf> fas3r: in the HTML?
[10:48:50] <fas3r> yep.
[10:49:11] <rindolf> fas3r: it sounds like a strange thing to do though.
[10:50:54] <rindolf> fas3r: see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link - <link /> supports the global attrs.
[10:54:19] <fas3r> rindolf: well ... my website is using mostly ajax to load pages ... I don't want to load all my css/ js script with the index page as I load it only once... I was thinking about loading the files depends on the pages/section dynamically
[11:01:50] <rindolf> fas3r: ah, I see.
[11:32:52] <kegster> how can i bind something to a scroll? like having a logo move and decrease in size as the user scrolls, etc
[11:37:12] <kegster> so like 10pixels of scroll is 10% of animation or something
[11:39:15] <Kartagis> kegster: you don't have to bind an event. just act on window.PageYOffset
[11:39:55] <kegster> hmm interesting
[11:41:22] <kegster> so use .scroll() ?
[12:01:09] <bambanx> guys how i can persist my jquery app ? the easy way is using json?
[12:14:35] <kegster> Kartagis, can you be a little more specific maybe? i'm having a hard time looking into your suggestion. i did find superscrollorama, but i feel that is not necessary to do what i want
[12:19:10] <lalalaaa> kegster: why dont you start with a test case and we'll take it from there?
[12:19:24] <lalalaaa> kegster: https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[12:24:43] <kegster> well, i mean--- let's just say i wanted the CSS of something to go from top:150px; to top:0; -- but attached to the scrolling? i just don't even know what to put together as a test case haha
[12:34:09] <One3yed> how do i get the zoom value to calculate the width of screen no matter what zoom level i am
[12:34:36] <lalalaaa> kegster: whenever i want a new feature for my app i always start with a test case.. both for my own sake and for the sake of those i'll be asking for help later on :)
[12:36:49] <madprops> hi
[12:37:02] <madprops> is there a way to select all <a> that are not inside certain divs
[12:37:14] <madprops> like 'get all links except the ones inside this div and that div
[12:38:16] <rindolf> madprops: you can select the <a> and then look throguht their parents.
[12:38:32] <rindolf> madprops: using .filter (sp?) or whatever
[12:39:11] <rindolf> madprops: it still sounds like bad design on  your part.
[12:39:28] <madprops> oh i see
[13:57:35] <madprops> is it normal for jquery to scroll to the top of the prepended html?
[13:57:46] <madprops> like i prepend something and i want the scrolling position to stay the same
[13:57:53] <madprops> but it goes to the top for some reason
[13:58:03] <madprops> i dont think this happened before
[14:23:45] <Whiskey> I try to select <table class="Info"><tr><td><div><span class="infoViewLineLeft">Date:</span> whit $("table.Info > tr:eq(0)").find(".infoViewLineLeft").html("2009-11-29");
[14:23:47] <Whiskey> whats wrong?
[14:34:33] <derekZero_> Anybody live?
[14:38:27] <Whiskey> yeh
[14:42:31] <derekZero_> Is there an ideal alternative to animating besides jQuery?
[14:43:08] <derekZero_> Something that loads faster than using a library.
[14:55:52] <rindolf> derekZero_: hi.
[14:56:04] <derekZero_> hi
[14:56:12] <rindolf> derekZero_: you can write the code yourself in low-level JS.
[14:56:30] <rindolf> derekZero_: but then you may face some portability problems.
[14:56:40] <derekZero_> The dreaded browser issues...
[14:56:53] <rindolf> derekZero_: right.
[14:57:54] <rindolf> derekZero_: I recall being referred to code that didn't work on Firefox, because it didn't use jQ and was written sloppily. And it was documented in the quirksmode site.
[14:57:55] <derekZero_> Well I've been having issues with a few lines of jquery. Would you mind helping me fix an animation problem I'm having? I'm trying to get the HTML body to fall from above but it falls from center to below.
[14:58:11] <derekZero_> yikes
[14:58:47] <derekZero_> $(document).ready(function() {
[14:58:47] <derekZero_> 	$("html, body")
[14:58:47] <derekZero_> 		.css('visibility', 'visible')
[14:58:47] <derekZero_> 		.animate({opacity: 1.0, top: 500}, 1000, function() {
[14:58:47] <derekZero_> 		});
[14:58:48] <derekZero_> });
[15:00:05] <rindolf> derekZero_: please don't flood.
[15:00:18] <rindolf> derekZero_: use a paste site.
[15:00:26] <derekZero_> Would you prefer a link to JSfiddle?
[15:00:33] <rindolf> derekZero_: I guess.
[15:04:07] <derekZero_> I would greatly appreciate your help: https://jsfiddle.net/pz4ymv4a/
[15:10:14] <rindolf> derekZero_: let me see.
[15:11:28] <rindolf> derekZero_: are you calling .animate on the .css or on $("html, body")?
[15:12:11] <derekZero_> on the html, body
[15:12:16] <derekZero_> brb
[15:14:12] <rindolf> derekZero_: OK.
[15:22:59] <derekZero_>  back
[15:24:55] <derekZero_> rindolf: I was trying to get a fade in/slide down effect to happen concurrently. It almost works, but I want it to slide from above the page down to center. Also, I'm not sure how to slow down the effect with this syntax. Would I write duration: x in the .animate brackets?
[15:31:43] <rindolf> derekZero_: can't you use something else instead of "1000" - this is the duration in milliseconds.
[15:32:35] <derekZero_> Let's see...
[15:33:27] <derekZero_> rindolf: One less problem to worry about. The resource I learned this on didn't mention the unit of measurement.
[15:33:53] <rindolf> derekZero_: :-)
[15:34:41] <rindolf> derekZero_: http://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/text/Test-jquery-animation.html - this is what I made of your page - the jsfiddle semantics confuzzled me.
[15:34:43] <derekZero_> rindolf: I feel like the secret to my other problem is in the top:. I've tried using negative numbers, but that just makes it go in the other direction xD
[15:35:34] <derekZero_> Oh, interesting.
[15:37:22] <derekZero_> rindolf: To make it drop from above, do I need to write the CSS so it starts higher on the page?
[15:38:02] <rindolf> derekZero_: I think so.
[15:38:22] <rindolf> derekZero_: it changes the CSS from the start to the parameters you give it.
[16:17:39] <z1haze> can someone give me a quick hand with dropzone.js? I have included all the dropzone.js file, and the css files, and instantiated a new dropzone with $("#dropzone-example").dropzone({ url: "/file/post" }); and created a <div id="dropzone-example"></div> but .. nothing is showing up at all
[16:24:44] <jak2000> not know why when i do this: $('#ftarcarga').submit();  automatically execute 2 times the submit, why?
[16:40:54] <rindolf> z1haze: do you have the code online?
[16:41:06] <z1haze> no, unfortunately not, but i think ill figure it out
[17:03:27] <kimjacobsen_> evening :) (Danish Time)
[17:05:01] <jak2000> not know why when i do this: $('#ftarcarga').submit();  automatically execute 2 times the submit, why?
[17:05:12] <kimjacobsen_> im having an issue with Jquery Mobile. i get duplicate sliders when i go back to the page (back or through links) is this a known issue ?
[17:05:16] <jak2000> my button: <button class='btnConsultar' id='btnConsultar' >Consultar</button>
[17:06:12] <kimjacobsen_> i have searched google for about 1 hour and i have a working fix.. but its not ideal..
[17:06:44] <kimjacobsen_> i destroy all duplicate sider and then reinitialise the sliders...
[17:07:36] <kimjacobsen_> also i want to mention its not a single page application website..
[17:08:35] <derstrom> jak2000: can you paste your full javascript code on a pastebin service (e.g. jsbin.com, jsfiddle.net) as that is the only way we can find out why this is occurring
[17:09:25] <jak2000> derekZero_ ok
[17:09:37] <derekZero_> ??
[17:09:44] <derstrom> I think he meant me ;-)
[17:09:49] <derekZero_> xD
[17:10:46] <jak2000> derstrom ok
[17:11:52] <jak2000> derstrom: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/gj0tzpve/
[17:12:01] <jak2000> for me this do 2 submit why?
[17:12:26] <derstrom> You need to paste the full JavaScript code. I can't really tell what the problem is just seeing your HTML.
[17:12:52] <derstrom> Paste the code and click Update, then provide the new URL :-)
[17:13:13] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/gj0tzpve/2/
[17:14:47] <derstrom> jak2000: It's because clicking on the btnCargaMasiva container fires a click event too.
[17:15:05] <derstrom> That's why it is being trigged twice, I assume.
[17:15:29] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/gj0tzpve/3/
[17:15:44] <jak2000> i am click on btnConsultar
[17:15:48] <derstrom> Sorry, forgive me, I didn't see the HTML code properly. That ID is for the button.
[17:16:09] <jak2000> yes
[17:16:50] <jak2000> then why?
[17:18:42] <derstrom> https://jsfiddle.net/gj0tzpve/5/ try this - I've added code to the top that prevents the browser from submitting the form automatically.
[17:19:51] <OnceMe> hello
[17:23:17] <rindolf> derstrom: thanks for helpin jak2000
[17:23:20] <rindolf> OnceMe: hi.
[17:23:41] <OnceMe> I have a issue, well maybe not an issue but question
[17:24:07] <OnceMe> how can I replace X element on page, which is picture, in video tag, but on hover, so picture remain while video loads?
[17:24:12] <OnceMe> Something like Vine does
[17:27:37] <OnceMe> rindolf:?
[17:28:17] <rindolf> OnceMe: no idea.
[17:28:47] <rindolf> OnceMe: maybe look at how vine is doing it.
[17:29:06] <OnceMe> their js is all minified
[17:29:14] <rindolf> OnceMe: ah.
[17:35:58] <kimjacobsen_> any have a solution for the slider duplication that occurs  when you return to tha page ?
[17:36:56] <kimjacobsen_> hi joepie ;) I love pie..
[17:39:52] <kimjacobsen_> i think is an error with Jquery mobile or is it not made for normal webpages ???
[17:46:49] <kimjacobsen_> is JQuery mobile deprecated ??
[17:49:49] <z1haze> can someone please explain how I would go about removeing a div after its been deleted from an ajax request, and then slide the rest of the content over
[17:50:57] <z1haze> i have a little area that shows uploaded images, and when you click on the thumbnail it asks if you want to delete, and i want to submit an ajax request to delete it from the database. I just do not know how to remove it from the page and slide the rest of the content over
[17:52:59] <kimjacobsen_> z1haze, what service ar you using ?
[17:53:40] <kimjacobsen_> you can do it on success as a call back function
[17:53:59] <kimjacobsen_> but you need the divs to have an id..
[17:54:07] <kimjacobsen_> or other identifier..
[17:54:34] <kimjacobsen_> Then just remove it... with $('#id').destroy()
[17:54:45] <z1haze> what do you mean?
[17:55:05] <z1haze> ok, but the transition to readjust the div, does jquery just do that on its own?
[17:55:36] <kimjacobsen_> use css and float left or right ...
[17:56:03] <kimjacobsen_> you can even animate it using css or if your not good with css use Transit. or velocity ..
[17:56:45] <kimjacobsen_> if the images are floated left or right the removal will rearrange the pictures for free
[17:57:03] <z1haze> so basically, just make the ajax call, use .destroy in the callback and float the items and use transitions to make it adjust?
[17:57:24] <kimjacobsen_> no css float will do it for free...
[17:57:43] <derstrom> destroy() doesn't exist in the jQuery library. use remove() to permanently remove an element from the DOM. if you want to keep the element in memory so you can re-add it to the DOM later on, use detach() instead of remove()
[17:57:48] <z1haze> ok let me try and see what happens
[17:57:49] <kimjacobsen_> but if you want it to look nice you can use transit first then destroy once the removed image is 0% wide...
[17:58:04] <z1haze> so not $('#id').destroy() ?
[17:58:16] <kimjacobsen_> 2 sek..
[17:58:23] <derstrom> https://api.jquery.com/remove
[17:58:31] <derstrom> use this to destroy the element once it's hidden
[17:58:31] <OnceMe> if I use something lilke this function hoverVideo(index, e) {
[17:58:32] <OnceMe>     vid[index].play();
[17:58:32] <OnceMe> }
[17:58:35] <kimjacobsen_> its remove() sorry
[17:58:38] <OnceMe> how can I current timeupdate in jQuery?
[17:58:55] <OnceMe> I mean I access vid[index], but doing vid[index].on() gives me error, that vid[index] is not a function
[17:59:40] <OnceMe> any ideas?
[17:59:54] <z1haze> can i use something like $(this).parents('form')
[17:59:59] <z1haze> for the identifier
[17:59:59] <derstrom> z1haze: perhaps a method like slideUp() may suffice to create a transition effect as the image is "deleted", but make sure you remove() after slideUp() has finished
[18:01:10] <derstrom> e.g. $('elem').slideUp( 600, function() { $('elem').remove() } );
[18:01:38] <OnceMe> derstrom:any help for me, maybe? :D
[18:02:41] <kimjacobsen_> as derstrom  said when the element is removed the css float property will slide it for you ... actually snap it;)
[18:03:12] <derstrom> for the horizontal equivalent of slideUp(), you'll need to do some magic with animate()
[18:03:20] <kimjacobsen_> OnceMe,  whats the issue?
[18:03:53] <kimjacobsen_> derstrom, if he wants to get rid of the snap ;)
[18:04:06] <OnceMe> function hoverVideo(index, e) {   vid[index].play();   }
[18:04:11] <OnceMe> thats how I start each video on hover
[18:04:23] <z1haze> is there a slide left?
[18:04:28] <OnceMe> so I need timeupdate for each video, I mean I access vid[index], but doing vid[index].on() gives me error, that vid[index] is not a function
[18:04:46] <z1haze> like animate width from right to left?
[18:04:55] <kimjacobsen_> z1haze,  you could use Transit or velocity JS..
[18:05:08] <z1haze> not gonna get a whole library just for this
[18:05:17] <kimjacobsen_> okay ;P
[18:05:35] <kimjacobsen_> its client side so who cares right hihi ;P
[18:06:28] <kimjacobsen_> z1haze,  her you go.. http://jsfiddle.net/G6bTD/
[18:06:41] <kimjacobsen_> query
[18:07:21] <kimjacobsen_> if do element has a float right property the rest will follow..
[18:08:09] <z1haze> yea i got it working on my end
[18:08:14] <z1haze> but it just snaps
[18:08:48] <z1haze> id like to just fadeout the image and then have the rest of the stuff animate 'slide' to its new place
[18:12:14] <derstrom> OnceMe: Try converting the element into an object using $(vid[i]).bind (not bind())
[18:13:13] <z1haze> Guys, i got it working like 90% just using fadeout on the item that i remove() but after it disappears, there is a sudden snap where the rest of the content moves to the new positon: what is needed to smooth that
[18:13:24] <derstrom> OnceMe: sorry, should be $(vid[index]).bind
[18:13:43] <kimjacobsen_> http://jsfiddle.net/G6bTD/16/
[18:13:53] <kimjacobsen_> to z1haze
[18:13:58] <derstrom> z1haze: It will do that with fadeOut(), because the element is being removed suddenly.
[18:14:24] <z1haze> yea i understand..
[18:14:37] <z1haze> but isnt there anything that can say hey, when you adjust your positon, do it over this much time
[18:14:46] <derstrom> Do you want to horizontally slide an element out of view as well as fade out at the same time?
[18:14:46] <OnceMe> ok
[18:14:48] <z1haze> i tried using transition:1s on the element in css but it does nothing
[18:14:53] <OnceMe> I need to use .on not .bind though :D
[18:15:03] <derstrom> I'm not referring to the bind() method in jQuery
[18:15:08] <z1haze> i dont really care how i get rid of it, i just like fade, slide left and fade sounds perfect
[18:15:30] <z1haze> derstrom, that sounds perfect
[18:15:38] <kimjacobsen_> z1haze,  you can face and change the with at the same time :)
[18:15:53] <kimjacobsen_> width*
[18:16:12] <derstrom> perhaps try animate() the width to 0 px and opacity to 0 at the same time?
[18:16:14] <z1haze> in your example you showed me, there is still a snap
[18:16:19] <derstrom> don't know if it'll work though :-)
[18:16:34] <kimjacobsen_> its because of the margin... use padding instead..
[18:16:41] <z1haze> i want to fade out the image, then after its faded out, slide the rest over, easing like
[18:16:45] <z1haze> i dont care if its all at the same time
[18:17:01] <z1haze> i just dont know the concept of making the rest of the stuff move into place gracefully
[18:17:44] <cannap> flexbox
[18:18:06] <z1haze> http://jsfiddle.net/davidThomas/Ccswn/7/ something like this, kinda i think
[18:19:26] <z1haze> sorry if im asking what seems to be the same question over and over..
[18:19:47] <kimjacobsen_> http://jsfiddle.net/G6bTD/17/
[18:19:57] <kimjacobsen_> is that it ??
[18:20:15] <kimjacobsen_> remember to destroy the element after thou ;)
[18:20:16] <z1haze> I have a div that has a bunch of forms, which an image and link which i click, get a confirm box, click yes and it fades out the image.. all that is great.. the problem is the sudden jerk AFTER the image fades out where the rest of the content jumps to its new place. I want to slooooowwwly slide the new content to its new place
[18:20:26] <z1haze> ok lemm see
[18:20:42] <z1haze> thats a lot nicer
[18:20:57] <z1haze> would it do the same thing with fadeOut()?
[18:20:57] <kimjacobsen_> have no fade tho...
[18:21:02] <kimjacobsen_> yes
[18:21:31] <z1haze> i changed to fadeout and it just jerks again
[18:22:23] <kimjacobsen_> ahhh its because the div is remove with the fade if you nest a element inside it will not happen :)
[18:23:09] <derstrom> OnceMe: Can you try $(vid[index]).on()
[18:24:12] <OnceMe> yes
[18:24:13] <OnceMe> works fine
[18:24:20] <OnceMe> let me check timeupdate now
[18:24:29] <z1haze> i got it working how i want now i just dont now how to add the closure
[18:25:04] <derstrom> OnceMe: So the error message showed that vid[index] was not a jQuery object, which explains why on() did not exist.
[18:25:32] <OnceMe> yap works fine
[18:25:35] <OnceMe> tahnks derstrom! :)
[18:25:41] <derstrom> You're welcome. Glad it is sorted for you.
[18:27:00] <z1haze> kimjacobsen_, http://dpaste.com/24B9AVK how do you add a callback/closure on this?
[18:28:17] <derstrom> .animate({ ... }, 800, function(complete) { });
[18:28:47] <derstrom> the third parameter is the function to execute when the animation is complete
[18:28:53] <kimjacobsen_> im to slow was working on  fiddle xD
[18:29:57] <z1haze> oh i have to pass in complete?
[18:30:02] <derstrom> you can remove the variable inside the function though, I don't think anything is returned in the function (unless it's the original object that the animation was performed on?)
[18:30:29] <derstrom> but either way, 'complete' is optional
[18:30:44] <z1haze> i think i had it right then
[18:31:06] <derstrom> so .animate( { ... }, 800, function() { } ) is fine too
[18:31:19] <z1haze> is this right? http://dpaste.com/2H716CW
[18:31:43] <z1haze> oh i have that ) in the wrong place
[18:32:04] <derstrom> yes, needs to be at the end
[18:32:08] <z1haze> i see now, thank you
[18:33:17] <kimjacobsen_> derstrom,  i have a issue im hoping to find a proper solution for..
[18:33:53] <kimjacobsen_> The Jquery Mobile slider. is being duplicated on page navigation and returns to the page with the slider on it...
[18:34:20] <kimjacobsen_> i have looked and looked and i can't get the damn thing to go away..
[18:34:26] <kimjacobsen_> http://gopare.dk/gopare
[18:34:32] <kimjacobsen_> its on the front page ...
[18:35:04] <derstrom> I see JavaScript errors repeated twice in my dev tools console.
[18:35:10] <derstrom> Are you sure the library isn't being included twice?
[18:35:22] <kimjacobsen_> 2 sek.. ill look..
[18:36:12] <kimjacobsen_> derstrom, i think your right...
[18:37:29] <kimjacobsen_> derstrom,  Duplicated is gone error still persists..
[18:37:51] <kimjacobsen_> Please ignore the glyphs... i still haven't included them,..
[18:38:42] <kimjacobsen_> my fast solution is on document ready to remove the extra sliders and the reinitialising but its a Crap solution...
[18:39:38] <derstrom> yes, ideally need to find the root cause
[18:39:58] <derstrom> Can you paste the code that creates the sliders please? jsfiddle.net
[18:40:10] <derstrom> I mean, creates an instance of them - your code
[18:40:44] <kimjacobsen_> yep on it..
[18:41:10] <derstrom> The only thing that springs to mind is whether you are asking the library to add the sliders to a specific class that is not unique to the page (i.e. repeated twice)
[18:41:18] <kimjacobsen_> btw you can't navigate back and fourth on fiddle :/
[18:41:43] <derstrom> That's fine, I don't need to see the result of the JavaScript code at the moment.
[18:42:05] <derstrom> It may help to try and instantiate the slider against an HTML element that has a unique ID.
[18:42:12] <derstrom> see if that is the cause
[18:43:00] <kimjacobsen_> okay ... fiddle it is ;)
[18:49:02] <kimjacobsen_> https://jsfiddle.net/ju29hybp/
[18:51:39] <derstrom> On your page, you do have two parent div's (<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">...</div>) that holds each slider. Are you sure you haven't repeated this HTML twice in your source code?
[18:52:06] <kimjacobsen_> ahhh your right ...
[18:52:08] <kimjacobsen_> 2 sek...
[18:53:07] <derstrom> I thought you were initialising these sliders dynamically... I'm not familiar with the library you're using, but the only logical explanation from what I can see is the HTML code must be repeated twice in source.
[18:57:04] <kimjacobsen_> derstrom, i removed the slider out of the forloop. in the macro its only 1 command that creates the slider now..
[18:57:15] <kimjacobsen_> <form class="col-xs-12">
[18:57:15] <kimjacobsen_> 	<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
[18:57:15] <kimjacobsen_> 	<label for="slider-1">Slider (default is "false"):</label>
[18:57:15] <kimjacobsen_> 	<input type="range" name="content-1" id="content-1" data-highlight="true" min="0" max="100" value="50">
[18:57:15] <kimjacobsen_> </div>
[18:58:19] <kimjacobsen_> maby its Umbraco that keeps adding it...
[18:58:26] <kimjacobsen_> But its  a bit odd.
[18:58:55] <derstrom> Well that suggests the for loop is being iterated twice.
[18:59:05] <derstrom> ...if you have the slider HTML inside the for loop,
[18:59:42] <kimjacobsen_> not any more.. i move it out.. on the http://gopare.dk/gopare
[18:59:44] <kimjacobsen_> page
[19:00:19] <kimjacobsen_> but the error persists..
[19:03:44] <kimjacobsen_> derstrom, Thanks any ways.. ill take a look at it later i need to sleep if i can ;) its 1am her and i have a meeting tomorrow...
[19:42:38] <OnceMe> derstrom:are you still here?
[19:42:45] <derstrom> OnceMe: yes
[19:42:59] <OnceMe> just one question, that my function works fine, as long as I dont append new stuff via ajax
[19:43:06] <OnceMe> do I need some load event binder or something?
[19:43:34] <derstrom> Can you show me the code again? All I can remember is $(vid[index]).on() :-)
[19:43:55] <OnceMe> pastebin or jsfiddle?
[19:44:02] <OnceMe> I mean I cant make it work on jsfiddle atm
[19:44:05] <OnceMe> so pastebin I guess
[19:44:14] <derstrom> whatever works for you
[19:44:44] <OnceMe> here derstrom http://pastebin.com/wa3WcNp0
[19:44:56] <OnceMe> just dont resubmit or whatever, I dont want that code to end up on pastebin forever :D
[19:45:19] <OnceMe> that, you can see I added .on() for $("#updates") but now with that add, it doesnt work for main load
[19:45:32] <OnceMe> and without that, it works for first main load, and doesnt work for appended via ajax videos, on hover.
[19:45:42] <OnceMe> I append to #updates selector
[19:46:15] <OnceMe> and oh my bad, replace delegate with .on
[19:46:29] <derstrom> I was just about to suggest that.
[19:47:13] <lalalaaa> Hi! I have this dropdown menu here which uses JS to wrap items in column divs based on height of the screen: http://jsfiddle.net/cwwpgfy3/2/
[19:47:16] <lalalaaa> Nowadays, could such a setup be simplified using flexbox?
[19:47:59] <derstrom> lalalaaa: As long as you don't care about IE 9 or below lol
[19:48:34] <OnceMe> derstrom:got any ideas how to solve this?
[19:48:50] <OnceMe> Usually I solved it with delegate and click event on it for #updates, but this is a different thing
[19:49:02] <OnceMe> I could maybe append some hover selector on .on()
[19:49:09] <bluesnow> Hi, I'm getting an odd bug where $(element).position() returns the correct value in Chrome, but not in Firefox
[19:49:19] <bluesnow> Is this a known bug with Firefox by any chance?
[19:49:37] <derstrom> bluesnow: Have you got any custom fonts being loaded on the page?
[19:49:49] <derstrom> Sounds very similar to an issue I recently had.
[19:49:55] <derstrom> OnceMe: Let me have a look.
[19:50:07] <OnceMe> ok
[19:50:08] <OnceMe> Use event delegation. This will ensure the event is fired for elements that did not exist at DOM load. Bind to a static parent element (in this case the body)
[19:50:13] <bluesnow> derstrom: Hmm, yes I might have some custom fonts being loaded. I'm not sure..
[19:50:14] <lalalaaa> derstrom: I do not, no. But for real, I can achieve the same thing with flexbox?
[19:51:12] <derstrom> bluesnow: If you have, try and move the $(element).position() into window.onload = function() { ... code here ... } to see if the fonts are still loading when the .ready() event is fired
[19:51:34] <OnceMe> lol I fixed it derstrom
[19:51:42] <lalalaaa> derstrom: Because now I have JS measuring the height of the screen and then calculates how many items can fit into each column
[19:51:43] <derstrom> OnceMe: How did you fix it? :)
[19:51:44] <OnceMe> Im not sure if this is efficient though
[19:51:57] <OnceMe> first line replaced with this one $updates.on("mouseover", '.videoView', function (e) {
[19:51:58] <derstrom> I wasn't really sure what your problem was, so I was about to ask you to clarify :p
[19:52:21] <OnceMe> but yeah on is useful when you want to make delegation for dom which does not exists, yet.
[19:52:33] <OnceMe> I dont know why I used delegate() before
[19:52:43] <bluesnow> derstrom: Hmm the $(element).position() should be happening well after any fonts are loaded. It happens in response to a click on a page element
[19:52:46] <OnceMe> derstrom: for how long are you programming in JS/jQuery?
[19:52:57] <bluesnow> though, some adjusting of the page also happens before and after I call $(element).position()
[19:54:42] <OnceMe> eh I found a bug, when I hover on videoView for the first time, on ajax-loaded videoView it wont play, and if I hover on ajax non-loaded videoView, it will work and then when I go back to ajax loaded videoView it will play it :O
[19:54:46] <OnceMe> what could cause this?
[19:55:12] <derstrom> bluesnow: I'd still recommend try putting the position() in window.onload = function() { ... }
[19:56:41] <derstrom> OnceMe: Can you paste your updated code again, since you've changed it after your last pastebin.
[19:56:54] <OnceMe> just a sec, im going to try something
[19:58:51] <lalalaaa> derstrom: Were you for real when you said "yes" to my question whether it could be simplified?
[19:58:56] <lalalaaa> Or were you just talking in general lol
[19:59:45] <OnceMe> no luck, here is updated code derstrom http://pastebin.com/CenEgB7H
[19:59:59] <derstrom> I was talking in general if you decided to go flexbox route. I wasn't referring to your particular situation. I've personally looked at using flexbox before and I've had to abandon the idea because I needed to support IE 9 :-(
[20:00:05] <OnceMe> I tried instead of mouseover, mouseenter, but that doesnt change anything.
[20:00:28] <derstrom> IE always the pain, right?
[20:00:39] <lalalaaa> ah i see, no probs
[20:00:47] <bluesnow> derstrom: Okay, I'll try that.
[20:01:01] <lalalaaa> nope not for me, I ban all old IE clients from even entering my website so..
[20:01:16] <lalalaaa> anyway have a good one!
[20:02:59] <derstrom> OK I understand the problem OnceMe, it took a while to figure out what you meant above!
[20:03:23] <OnceMe> ok, got any ideas how to solve it/ :D
[20:04:21] <derstrom> Just wondering, var figure = $(".videoView"); - does this refer to the current video that fired the on() hover event?
[20:05:05] <derstrom> if it does, replace this generic stuff with $(this)
[20:05:21] <derstrom> and then use $(this).find('video') or something along those lines
[20:05:42] <derstrom> perhaps this is the source of the problem?
[20:06:28] <OnceMe> sec
[20:09:03] <OnceMe> hmm I did that
[20:09:37] <OnceMe> but actually something else is problem derstrom
[20:09:45] <OnceMe> I did further tests and when I hover on ajax loaded video
[20:09:55] <OnceMe> for the first time and hoverout from videoView scope
[20:10:07] <OnceMe> and hoverin again, in the same ajax loaded videoView, it loads
[20:10:19] <OnceMe> not sure what is causing this, but without .on and mouseover, it works fine for the first hover
[20:10:59] <OnceMe> so mouseover event might be a problem
[20:11:10] <derstrom> I would change mouseover to hover
[20:12:03] <OnceMe> now doesnt work at all :P
[20:12:41] <OnceMe> problem must be somewhere that im adding hover inside the mouseover closure.
[20:12:59] <OnceMe> I assume
[20:13:08] <bluesnow> derstrom: You still around?
[20:13:29] <derstrom> I am curious as to why you can't do the hover event on the video itself? If you need to get something from the .videoView element, you can always use $(this).parent()
[20:14:01] <bluesnow> derstrom: I tried putting the function a window.load, but it's still not working
[20:14:02] <OnceMe> ?
[20:14:22] <bluesnow> I tried debugging the $(element).position() with alert, and it tells me that all the elements are at the same position, which they're not..
[20:14:30] <derstrom> Whenever I use .on() to hook an event to a dynamically added element, I always use $('body').on('hover', '.element', function() { ... })
[20:14:44] <derstrom> bluesnow: in Firefox too?
[20:14:50] <OnceMe> look at line 6
[20:14:55] <OnceMe> I think thats the issue
[20:15:07] <bluesnow> derstrom: It's only telling me that all the elements are in the same position in Firefox. It works correctly in Chrome.
[20:15:13] <OnceMe> but I cant remove whole [].forEach thing as it will broke all videoView's
[20:15:16] <derstrom> OnceMe: Does the video stop playing when you hover out?
[20:15:22] <OnceMe> yes
[20:15:30] <bluesnow> derstrom: When I say "all the elements", I mean a set of elements in my SVG that I'm trying to get the positions of
[20:15:30] <OnceMe> that is fine, its not playing when I hoverin for the first time
[20:16:15] <derstrom> OnceMe: Perhaps the mouseout event is being fired straight away after mouseover?
[20:16:26] <OnceMe> I doubt
[20:16:34] <OnceMe> because I have console.log for timeupdate
[20:16:43] <OnceMe> and its not showing, not even 0.01 for the first play
[20:16:51] <OnceMe> line 15
[20:17:00] <derstrom> Yes, I see.
[20:17:15] <derstrom> Have you got a page where I can see this problem live?
[20:17:57] <OnceMe> not really
[20:17:59] <OnceMe> its all localhost
[20:18:10] <derstrom> bluesnow: I really am not sure what the possible problem is here.
[20:18:52] <derstrom> It's very odd, but I have had similar issues before and for me, it had to do with fonts.
[20:19:10] <bluesnow> derstrom: Maybe something to do with how Firefox handles SVG elements?
[20:19:22] <bluesnow> I'm trying to get the positions of SVG elements
[20:20:08] <derstrom> bluesnow: Perhaps. Your guess is as good as mine really.
[20:20:26] <OnceMe> what else should I try?
[20:20:59] <OnceMe> derstrom:I found this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9418115/mouse-over-function-not-working-for-first-time-after-page-load
[20:21:14] <OnceMe> but how to tailor it to my problem
[20:21:52] <derstrom> OnceMe: Can you add console.log() to the on event just to make sure that, even though the video is not playing when you first hover over a dynamically gen. element, that the event handler is being fired
[20:22:21] <derstrom> It has to work!
[20:22:58] <OnceMe> for 'hover'
[20:23:02] <OnceMe> or 'mouseover' event?
[20:23:20] <derstrom> for $("#updates").on("mouseover", [...]
[20:23:27] <OnceMe> for hover it doesnt work
[20:23:30] <OnceMe> for mouseover it works
[20:25:07] <OnceMe> if I could somehow changed addEventListener mouseover
[20:25:10] <OnceMe> to load or something
[20:25:18] <OnceMe> because thats the issue 100%
[20:25:32] <OnceMe> im already hovered inside first viewView and that first instance of addEventListener never occurs
[20:25:35] <OnceMe> for the first time
[20:26:23] <OnceMe> yap confirmed, I changed it to addEventListener('click' and on first hover and first click, it plays video
[20:26:30] <OnceMe> so I need a way around for mpuseover :D
[20:29:25] <OnceMe> derstrom:?
[20:30:07] <derstrom> Hmm, I think the reason this is happening is because the first mouseover event is fired fine (line 1), and then you're adding the two separate event handlers for the video inside the mouseover event handler you've created at line 1
[20:31:00] <OnceMe> well thats what I said :P
[20:31:07] <OnceMe> but sec, I think Im on the right path atm
[20:32:21] <derstrom> I actually think you only need two event handlers for the <video> tag itself. You can then get rid of the unhelpful videoView mouseover event
[20:33:42] <OnceMe> all solved!!
[20:33:45] <OnceMe> yess
[20:33:50] <derstrom> even if <video> is dynamically added to the DOM, you can still use .on('mouseover', 'video', function(){...})
[20:34:01] <OnceMe> I removed addeventlistener
[20:34:30] <OnceMe> and just used .on('mouseover'....).on('mouseleave).... { vid.pause() } :)
[20:35:23] <derstrom> Good work.
[20:37:16] <OnceMe> now I need to add progressbar
[20:37:19] <OnceMe> the hard part ;(
[20:39:04] <OnceMe> ok cya derstrom
[20:39:09] <OnceMe> and thanks for help :)
[20:40:11] <derstrom> No problem.
[20:42:51] <z1haze> Can anyone give me a hand with dropzone.js? I am just trying to tie into an event and issue a callback function, but following their documentation i can use this.on("addedfile", function(file) { alert("Added file."); });
[20:43:25] <z1haze> but i get no alert with this test, and my dropzone full functions, stores in filesystem, etc.. i just have to reload the page for the images to show.. id rather just use an append method to add them to the dom as they are uploaded
[22:45:47] <z1haze> how can i use a template and input response variables from an ajax call?
[22:59:30] <derekZero_> Anybody home?
[23:03:38] <nodist> yeah
[23:12:01] <derekZero_> nodist: I'm trying to jQuery .animate a flexbox to fade in and slide down. Could you take a look at the code? https://jsfiddle.net/zLmvyjc3/
[23:26:56] <acidjazz> if i have a string with like "&lt;p&gt;" in JS how can i parse that to html so i can append it to an element?
[23:32:51] <duch_kazatel> nothing more elegant i can think of other than $('<textarea />').html("&lt;p&gt;").text()
