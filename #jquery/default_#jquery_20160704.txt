[01:13:56] <TheHackOps> Does anyone know why when i use the dateFormat option in the datepicker from jQueryUI it displays as dd-mm-yy instead of dd/mm/yy when by default it uses the / formatting convention?
[01:53:40] <adamsilver> Why this is not working in jQuery 3: $.event.props.push('state') ... it's giving: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'push' of undefined
[01:53:49] <adamsilver> It works fine with jQuery 2
[02:11:30] <morphyeys> morning
[02:18:19] <Cork> adamsilver: jquery 3 is a large rewrite and $.event.props doesn't exist anymore
[02:19:11] <adamsilver> Cork: oh, i see. thanks for the clarification
[02:19:14] <morphyeys> guys could you recommend me a good jQuery image upload component?
[02:21:48] <Cork> morphyeys: if you just want to upload the file you don't really need a plugin
[02:22:16] <Cork> or you're actually asking for an image scale/crop/rotate tool, then ya... donno
[02:22:22] <Cork> or==are

[03:27:26] <DreamStiffler> Hi, i want to do this https://jqueryui.com/slider/#rangemax but using a selectbox instead. possible?
[03:44:54] <Cork> DreamStiffler: sure, no problem
[03:46:12] <Cork> DreamStiffler: just make sure that each slider step exists as option in the field, and the exact same code should work
[04:29:08] <DreamStiffler> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/ygar3fk3/1/ what am i doing wrong here?
[04:44:01] <Cork> DreamStiffler: $("#likelihood").val( ui.value ); => $("#txt_likelihood").val( ui.value );
[05:28:17] <mauzilla> Hi all! Looking for a plugin for a product selector. User should click on an container and have that item selected via a form element. Any good suggestions?
[05:32:35] <WizJin> Hi people
[05:33:27] <WizJin> I want to load an external webpage, inside a div, something like .html
[05:33:33] <WizJin> .html()
[05:33:51] <WizJin> but i want to load a dynamic url, passing arguments
[05:38:36] <slax0r> why don't you?
[05:38:43] <WizJin> ?
[05:39:02] <WizJin> but official documentation says .html doesn't accept any arguments
[05:39:11] <WizJin> so is there any alternative ?
[05:39:31] <slax0r> what do you mean, "passing arguments" arguments to where?
[05:39:34] <slax0r> the external webpage?
[05:39:41] <slax0r> then it has nothing to do with .html()
[05:39:45] <Cork> slax0r: .html() takes a string that gets put into the page
[05:39:52] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[05:39:56] <Cork> WizJin: ^
[05:40:01] <slax0r> .html() sets or gets the HTML markup of an element
[05:40:18] <Cork> WizJin: you need to use ajax to fetch that page, note that this won't work cross domain
[05:40:38] <Cork> WizJin: if you don't control the target domain you have to use iframe
[05:40:38] <WizJin> i want to do it inter-domain only
[05:40:42] <slax0r> you need to load the external page markup with .ajax, or .get, or .post, and in the success handler attach the result to the element with .html
[05:40:52] <WizJin> hmm
[05:41:03] <Cork> WizJin: also note you won't get the css from that page
[05:41:16] <slax0r> unless if its inline
[05:41:21] <Cork> ya
[05:41:31] <WizJin> ehh
[05:41:41] <WizJin> i also want CSS
[05:41:41] <slax0r> it _might_ be easier to use an iframe
[05:41:46] <Cork> ya
[05:42:01] <Cork> if you want the page to be stand alone you basically need to use iframe
[05:42:17] <Cork> ajax merges the source into the current page
[05:42:22] <WizJin> can i use iframe without having to render in a modal, but as part of the page
[05:42:34] <Cork> ya
[05:42:40] <WizJin> awesome
[05:42:53] <Cork> <iframe style="border: 0" href="somehwere"></iframe>
[05:43:09] <Cork> though you will get a heap of other problems to deal with
[05:43:19] <Cork> but from what it sounds like it is what you need
[05:44:49] <WizJin> can i pass a dynamic value in href. like baseurl + 'questions?id=' + jobId + '&user=' + userId
[05:45:06] <Cork> its an attribute, just like any other elements
[05:45:31] <Cork> i recommend using $.param() though
[05:45:44] <Cork> (instead of concating a values like that
[05:46:05] <Cork> url + $.param({ id: jobId, user: userId });
[05:46:29] <WizJin> so it can be done
[06:23:57] <DreamStiffler> thank Cork...my savior
[06:23:59] <DreamStiffler> smooches
[06:24:02] <DreamStiffler> ok later guts
[06:24:05] <DreamStiffler> *guys
[06:24:11] <DreamStiffler> happy iftaring
[07:39:14] <stemid> I generate table rows with unique id's like parent-row-444 and child-row-444 but is there a trick in jquery that will let me use .on() and toggle() to have parent row 444 expand child row 444 and so forth?
[07:39:38] <stemid> I guess if I get the attribute of $(this) maybe
[07:39:44] <stemid> then I can extract the ID from there
[07:39:54] <stemid> and put .on() on parent-row-*
[07:40:10] <stemid> am I in the ballpark?
[08:30:45] <Cork> stemid: yes, there is, you just need to use classes instead of ids
[08:48:54] <ycon_> Hi all, I keep getting this Uncaught TypeError when I use $function(). http://dpaste.com/137PABW
[08:49:19] <ycon_> If I use "$(".element") then it functions- but not properly (ie can't append content to html
[08:49:40] <Cork> ycon_: it just means .typed isn't a function
[08:49:50] <Cork> aka. the plugin for loading $.fn.typed isn't loaded
[08:50:02] <ycon_> So it's not loading in order right?
[08:50:27] <Cork> can't tell as i don't have the context
[08:50:42] <stemid> Cork: yeah I figured I could use parent class and child class, and then set $('.parent').on() and get the next child class of each parent. well you get the idea I think. but the problem is that my parent class is added dynamically so I'm going to try to use event delegation.
[08:51:10] <Cork> stemid: ya, i didn't mean to use $('.parent').on
[08:51:15] <Cork> that is a bad idea anyway
[08:51:23] <stemid> https://jsfiddle.net/T8t2r/915/ like that?
[08:51:30] <Cork> just do $('table').on('<event>', '.parent', func)
[08:51:45] <stemid> oh ok
[08:52:09] <Cork> also no you don't have to use getChildren
[08:52:23] <Cork> jsut do $(this).nextAll('.child').first()
[08:52:31] <stemid> I see, thanks!
[08:55:00] <ycon_> Cork: Sure- this is the site where I'm getting that error- lifeworthliving.com
[08:55:11] <ycon_> wait, www.thislifeworthliving.com
[08:56:08] <Cork> ycon_: you load jquery twice
[08:56:16] <Cork> so you reset the typed plugin you load
[08:56:36] <ycon_> Ah! Such a rookie!
[08:56:45] <ycon_> thanks
[09:23:02] <FastSnail> Hello, how can you trigger a change function to run on page load as well?
[09:31:21] <FastSnail> at the moment I'm just triggering the change on load, $( document ).ready(function() { $('.class').trigger('change'); });, but wanted to know if there's a better way to say, if on page load or if changed, do this.
[09:47:28] <Cork> FastSnail: that is normally the cleanest way
[09:47:42] <Cork> alternatively you can define the function separately and run it after
[09:48:07] <Cork> function change(event) {} $('.class').on('change', change); change();
[09:57:44] <FastSnail> Thanks Cork, really new to all this :) This is what I have so far, probably going around the houses.....http://hastebin.com/kozojugeye.xml
[09:59:20] <Cork> FastSnail: why not just generalize the code
[09:59:28] <Cork> then you don't need that part at all
[09:59:38] <FastSnail> What do you mean?
[09:59:42] <Cork> one min
[10:00:24] <Cork> btw it's 2016, time to drop the xhtml :)
[10:02:29] <FastSnail> :)
[10:03:21] <Cork> btw is the checkbox suppose to update the placeholder for all the fields?
[10:03:49] <Cork> (meaning how are the checkbox and the fields suppose to connect)
[10:04:14] <FastSnail> No, just the one with the class name1
[10:05:05] <philm88> I've got a $('.myclass').on('click', doSomething) which seems to be working fine. If I add a new link to the DOM with JS with the 'myclass' class - the JS doesn't get triggered when that new link is clicked. Previously I'd used jquery's .live method to make that work - but that's deprecated. Is there an alternative?
[10:05:58] <moldy> hi
[10:06:06] <FastSnail> Hey :)
[10:07:54] <Cork> FastSnail: https://jsfiddle.net/yxgavhf8/
[10:07:58] <Cork> something like that
[10:08:09] <Cork> then you can control the stats of placeholder from php
[10:08:16] <Cork> and you won't need the trigger code at all
[10:09:04] <FastSnail> @cork Thanks for taking the time to do that for me, just picking up the kids, bb in 15-20
[10:09:23] <Cork> FastSnail: ya, will post a new link, i've missed a few parts
[10:10:23] <Cork> FastSnail: https://jsfiddle.net/yxgavhf8/1/
[10:10:43] <Cork> philm88: you need to use delegation
[10:10:55] <philm88> Cork: thanks, I was just reading that on the docs now
[10:11:16] <Cork> philm88: $('').on('event', func) searches for the element matching the selector and adds the event listener directly to those elements
[10:11:24] <Cork> elements not in the dom won't be fond
[10:11:27] <Cork> *found
[10:11:27] <philm88> it seems I need to do $('parent').on('click', 'child', function(){})
[10:11:31] <Cork> and only those will work
[10:11:37] <Cork> ya
[10:11:56] <Cork> with delegation you search for a static parent, and listens for events bubbling up from children instead
[10:12:13] <Cork> that means new elements will work even if added later (as they have the same parent)
[10:12:44] <philm88> It wasn't working for me before because I got hte parent/child the wrong way round. I was expecting to still bind on the specific element I wanted (like you used to with .live) but that doesnt seem to be the case with delegation. Seems to be working fine now (:
[10:13:16] <Cork> philm88: .live was a horrible api, and ya it was really broken
[10:13:20] <Cork> (and why it got removed)
[10:13:48] <Cork> $('target').live('event') => $(document).on('event', 'target')
[10:14:11] <Cork> what $('target').live('event') did was search for all elements in the page matching 'target'
[10:15:05] <philm88> wouldn't that behaviour be the same as $('target').on('click')? Only difference being on won't search for elements added to the DOM after the being called?
[10:15:10] <Cork> then ignore that set and used the search string and did $(document).bind('event', function(event) { if($(event.target).closet(searchString).length > 0) { callback(); } })
[10:15:14] <Cork> no
[10:15:49] <Cork> this is similar to what $(document).on('event', 'target', func) does
[10:16:02] <Cork> but with a much cleaner api, and you can target another parent then document
[10:16:25] <philm88> makes sense
[10:16:33] <Cork> closet==closest
[10:45:55] <FastSnail> Hey Cork, just got back and had a look at your example. However it still show's the second input on load, if the box is ticked :S
[10:46:21] <Cork> FastSnail: ya, the point like i stated in the channel is do that management in php
[10:46:25] <Cork> then you don't need to trigger js
[10:46:42] <Cork> as i moved all the related data into the html you don't need js for initial load
[10:47:07] <Cork> (just set the value in the placeholder and data-* attributes)
[10:48:32] <FastSnail> sorry I don't understand, I can see wha
[10:50:31] <FastSnail> *what you've done, but if the box is ticked on the page load, I wanted the second input to be hidden. would I need to add a $( document ).ready(function() {
[10:50:31] <FastSnail> $('.checkbox').trigger('change');
[10:50:31] <FastSnail> });
[10:50:31] <FastSnail> ?
[11:10:03] <vancrash> If there is no instance of "$" or "jQuery" in a JS file, is it safe to say that that file does not use jquery?
[11:17:14] <shoky> not really
[11:17:40] <vancrash> shoky, is there a simple way to test?
[11:18:37] <shoky> for 100% of the cases? don't think so
[11:18:58] <vancrash> what about 95% of the cases?
[11:19:10] <vancrash> what sorts of other things would indicate the use of jquery?
[11:19:27] <shoky> a js file could have just a function that is passed in an instance of a jquery object
[11:19:32] <shoky> an it uses jquery methods on that jquery objects
[11:20:03] <shoky> e.g.    function foo(element) { element.text('blah'); }
[11:20:13] <shoky> you can't test  if that uses jquery or not
[11:20:21] <shoky> .text() could be from jquery or from any other library
[11:20:23] <vancrash> ah, what if the script is a lone script that does not interact with any other scripts?
[11:20:49] <shoky> then probably 99% of cases it's enough to look for $, jQuery, jquery  :P
[11:21:11] <vancrash> perfect. thanks
[11:47:54] <RoabT> Hi, was wondering if someone could answer this quick query... I have a few functions that find elements and then run functions, returning the result. I have one function that's supposed to return a number but it's returning undefined (or something that can't be converted in to a number) http://pastebin.com/5GCVfGfS
[11:48:08] <RoabT> Seems like its the way I'm attempting to do a functional-esque style
[11:48:17] <RoabT> was wondering why the last line is coming out as NaN, basically
[11:49:45] <RoabT> There's a mismatch between the 2 calls to console.log(), where as far as I can tell, there shouldn't be
[11:50:18] <shoky> RoabT: you're missing a return from `numActuals` function
[11:50:59] <RoabT> Oh god
[11:51:00] <RoabT> thanks :)
[12:19:52] <FastSnail> Hey Cork, how can I generalise this? http://hastebin.com/kiteribago.coffee
[12:40:07] <bitcycle> Hey all.  Can someone point me to a good example of a browse file form input?  Here's what I've got so far, but I believe I need the code to handle the POST under the covers.  I'd like to show a modal with progress while the upload occurrs.  http://pastebin.com/azYs58WD
[12:44:19] <manus> Hey, folks. Anyone know why the jQuery UI datepicker seems to not open when I do a single `.focus()` on the input? For some reason, I have to do it twice to trigger the calendar showing...
[12:45:09] <manus> For example, on https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/ , in the devtools console, I have to do `$('#datepicker').focus().focus()` to trigger the datepicker.
[12:45:36] <manus> (Please note, I'm not trying to programmatically access the picker widget directly.)
[13:22:33] <Vladimirski> I used jquery/javascript to loop through many json objects and then created an html list out of all the object. My question is how do I change this list now, because it's only inside the html code (innerHTML)?
[13:23:34] <NoiseEee> Vladimirski: ?
[13:25:04] <Vladimirski> NoiseEee: It's hard to explain so here's the code: http://codepen.io/RedCone/pen/vKgYjW?editors=1010
[13:25:55] <NoiseEee> Vladimirski: for this kind of thing, a mustache template would go a LONG way.
[13:26:01] <NoiseEee> don't compose HTML w/ JS
[13:26:13] <decx> go vue
[13:26:19] <Vladimirski> You see, the list is created by adding the li elements into the html code, but I struggle to figure out how to change that list in the future. For instance the "OFFLINE" button in the top should redo the list to only show offline elements
[13:26:34] <Vladimirski> NoiseEee: Mustache ?
[13:26:51] <NoiseEee> Vladimirski: a template
[13:27:07] <NoiseEee> Vladimirski: and as far as changing the list in the future, you can query the DOM adjust as needed?
[13:27:18] <Vladimirski> query the dom?
[13:27:22] <Vladimirski> what do you mean
[13:27:30] <NoiseEee> are you familiar with javascript?
[13:27:33] <Vladimirski> yes
[13:27:42] <decx> do a react crash course
[13:27:45] <decx> or vue
[13:28:20] <decx> you'll be better off than hopping on the dom manip train 10 years too late
[13:28:36] <NoiseEee> that's good advice too
[13:28:43] <Vladimirski> okey
[13:28:50] <Vladimirski> so which one is better?
[13:28:53] <Vladimirski> react or vue?
[13:29:08] <decx> react for resume, vue is super accessible
[13:29:48] <Vladimirski> and mustache?
[13:30:10] <NoiseEee> mustache is more old school, if you weren't going to use a UI type framework
[13:30:20] <decx> then you'll have to take care of what you rerender manually
[13:33:09] <Vladimirski> Okey, well thing is I am learning core javascript at the moment, so I'd rather not use any framwork except jquery
[13:33:34] <Vladimirski> So I just want to see if it's possible to do what I explained with only javascript and jquery
[13:38:15] <NoiseEee> well yes its possible of course, but cumbersome Vladimirski
[13:39:36] <Vladimirski> Alrighty, well Challenge accepted;)
[13:39:50] <NoiseEee> Vladimirski:  a few tips off your top, only one ID can be in a document, so ln 37 should be <div class='off'>
[13:40:00] <NoiseEee> and then you can hide/show things according to class, sure.
[13:40:49] <Vladimirski> cool, that's a great solution
[13:41:43] <NoiseEee> Vladimirski: but don't write HTML in your callback, at the very least put it in a function that you can refine and then re-use
[13:41:47] <NoiseEee> good luck
[13:42:21] <Vladimirski> but what do you mean by one ID in a document? NoiseEee
[13:43:22] <decx> you dont assign the same social security number twice do you
[13:43:47] <NoiseEee> Vladimirski: all IDs must be unique
[13:44:17] <Vladimirski> Oh I see
[13:45:25] <Vladimirski> And when using hide with the online/offline button, isn't it a good idea to set id's to each element so I know which ones to hide?
[13:45:27] <Vladimirski> NoiseEee:
[13:45:50] <NoiseEee> Vladimirski: not IDs, classes
[13:46:00] <NoiseEee> and use classes liberally
[13:46:04] <Vladimirski> liberally?
[13:46:10] <Vladimirski> as much as possible+
[13:46:10] <Vladimirski> ?
[13:46:16] <NoiseEee> class anything you might ever want to adjust
[13:46:27] <Vladimirski> okey, cool. Thanks for the tips
[13:46:49] <decx> really tho, if you are just starrting out there's no reason to not go datacentric from the getgo
[13:46:51] <Vladimirski> sorry for all the questions, this helps me alot. Learning all the conventions...
[13:47:04] <Vladimirski> datacentric?
[13:47:21] <decx> like what these new view libs do
[13:58:28] <Vladimirski> decx: okej:)
[14:07:15] <Vladimirski> NoiseEee: decx something like this: http://codepen.io/RedCone/pen/vKgYjW
[15:07:22] <cooltpt> anyone home?
[15:08:11] <cooltpt> I have a weird issue where $("#mydiv") is returning "[object Object]" as a string.. any ideas?
[15:08:43] <cooltpt> it's not returning the DOM element.. it is returning a string
[15:09:11] <arc_> need more code
[15:09:45] <arc_> sounds like you are trying to use a non-jquery method on a jquery object
[15:14:09] <cooltpt> just tred .. document.getElementById("mydiv") and it is returning "[object HTMLDivElement]" as a string
[15:14:26] <cooltpt> weird
[15:16:59] <shoky> cooltpt: it's not returning it as a string, you're just turning it into a string. that would happen if you alert() it or append it to some element..
[15:17:27] <shoky> er scratch the append part i said, heh
[15:17:32] <cooltpt> I am just console.log(document.getElementById("mydiv"));
[15:17:46] <shoky> what browser?
[15:17:52] <cooltpt> chrome
[15:18:09] <shoky> then you're doing something else...
[15:18:33] <arc_> that works for me
[15:18:35] <shoky> anyways that's what the string representation of objects looks like
[15:18:50] <shoky> maybe you're concatenating it to another string or something
[15:18:58] <cooltpt> if I .. for(k in obj) { console.log(k + ":" + obj[k]; }  it logs each char individually
[15:19:15] <shoky> string + something   turns something into a string
[15:19:38] <shoky> so, don't turn objects into strings like that, and you'll be fine.  you can use commas in console.log instead of +
[15:19:53] <shoky> e.g.  console.log('str', obj, 'str..')
[15:20:11] <arc_> yes, you're basically trying to get it to output a string and also its default output for an object on the same line
[15:20:16] <arc_> that won't work
[15:21:07] <cooltpt> shoky, thanks.. i'll look around.. i'm not appending a string or anything.. but the HTML is being injected into a page with $("#mainDiv").load("mydiv.html", function() {});
[15:21:40] <arc_> what is the purpose of the function parameter
[15:22:11] <cooltpt> just a callback after it's loaded.. I am not doing anything there.  I was just alerting that the page loaded
[15:22:19] <arc_> that should definitely work either way, assuming you have jquery loaded
[15:23:18] <cooltpt> the div is being used with jQueryUI.. think that is a problem?
[15:23:35] <shoky> no, you turning it into a string somewhere is the problem
[15:24:00] <shoky> anyways reproduce in a jsfiddle if you can't find it
[15:24:12] <arc_> so the html is actually properly being injected?
[15:24:16] <arc_> what is in your alert?
[15:27:10] <cooltpt> it's commented out.. there is no alert.. I just send it to console.log
[15:27:34] <cooltpt> let me see if I can minimize the code with the error; so I can post it
[15:29:16] <cooltpt> console.log("N:" + JSON.stringify(div));  returns the same thing
[15:29:37] <cooltpt> it thinks it's a string
[15:30:03] <arc_> can you just use commas like he said : /
[15:47:15] <shoky> cooltpt: you're using + like we said.. that turns objects into strings
[15:54:41] <cooltpt> shoky: thanks.. I figured it out.. I was trying to debug another problem b/c I wasn't seeing the interface that I expected and like you mentioned I was turning an object into a string while debugging the object trying to see aht the interaface available was.. anyway, thans a bazillion!
[16:54:16] <stemid> how do I use $('<table>').on('click', '.parent-row', function () { when rows are dynamically being added to the table? I can't seem to figure it out.
[16:55:06] <stemid> I'm trying to do var child = $(this).nextAll('.child-row').first(); child.toggle(); and child-row class is display:none;
[16:55:09] <shoky> that should work fine, assuming you mean $('table')  and that that the table already exists when you're calling that
[16:55:27] <stemid> yes the table exists, oh I am not supposed to use the <>
[16:55:37] <shoky> $('<table>')  creates a new <table> element
[16:55:42] <stemid> thanks
[16:56:13] <stemid> now it works
[19:33:48] <iDentity1337> I have an element which should slide down (it's hidden at first) on an event. slideDown() works but I need that display: flex on my element.
[19:33:51] <iDentity1337> Is there an alternative?
