[02:26:24] <mrush> why does the dude in funfunfunction tutorials never use semicolons in js
[02:26:27] <mrush> how can it be
[02:26:44] <Cork> mrush: its optional
[02:26:56] <Cork> though you can't minify a script if you do
[02:27:15] <mrush> how did i miss that its optional
[02:27:16] <mrush> lol
[02:27:33] <mrush> good caveat to note about minimization though. thanks Cork
[02:27:57] <Cork> mrush: the parser will put a ; when it sees a \n unless it is preceded by a }
[02:29:08] <Cork> mrush: a slight correction; you can minify, but the script that minifies needs to be a full js parser unless you use ;
[02:29:24] <Cork> you can't just do sed 's/\n//' *.js
[02:31:59] <mrush> kk i see what you mean
[02:36:34] <mrush> i think i'll just keep using them
[02:49:02] <grek> Hi i have problem with requirejs and boostrap - here is detailed example https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48464348/daterangepicker-close-parent-boostrap-dropdown
[05:40:31] <lissitzki> hi folks
[05:41:22] <lissitzki> This one https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/uyqb1vwx/ on my site is not working well
[05:41:50] <lissitzki> sometimes it do, sometimes not at all
[05:42:25] <lissitzki> here someone told me it maybe caused by the dinamyc generated contetn
[05:43:04] <lissitzki> and point at this: http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[05:43:05] <Cork> ya, line 2-4 will collect the elements that exist at that time and no other elements will be affected
[05:43:45] <lissitzki> Cork, can i then use an event delegation?
[05:44:00] <Cork> lissitzki: find a static parent and use delegation for the selector to that element ya
[05:44:21] <lissitzki> ok
[06:04:58] <RonaldsMazitis> https://jsfiddle.net/tkbd1uwx/
[06:05:48] <RonaldsMazitis> element #message is generated all the time, I need some way to check for it
[06:07:00] <Cork> RonaldsMazitis: bind it to a parent and delegate the change event
[06:07:08] <Cork> (a static parent)
[06:07:15] <Cork> RonaldsMazitis: http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[06:37:18] <undefined_bob> Cork: do you remeber my issues from yesterday with the .css stuff? I solved it with .addClass and some changes in my css. thanks for your suggestions yesterday
[06:54:49] <Cork> undefined_bob: np
[07:21:12] <tilerendering> are you ppl using web workers for e.g. periodically background-polling an api for new messages for the logged in user?
[07:21:38] <Cork> tilerendering: there is no point in using a worker for that
[07:21:52] <Cork> you need workers when you are going to do things that take a lot of time
[07:22:11] <Cork> not for sending a request and queuing a response handler :)
[08:10:59] <Sandlayth> hello guys
[08:11:06] <Sandlayth> hello world*
[08:11:25] <Sandlayth> do you know if there is a way to have a pointer to an object?
[08:14:16] <thykka> for what, exactly?
[08:14:20] <Cork> Sandlayth: just keep an object with a property pointing to it
[08:14:43] <thykka> JS doesn't have pointers
[08:14:45] <Cork> actually same for variable names
[08:14:50] <Cork> it does for objects
[08:14:59] <Cork> objects aren't copied by value
[08:15:09] <Cork> they are referenced
[08:15:19] <Sandlayth> actually, i've an object containing an array containing a single object containing an array containing a single object etc.
[08:15:21] <thykka> a reference is not a pointer
[08:15:37] <Sandlayth> i would like to access the -nth sub object
[08:16:11] <Cork> var a = { c: { v: [1,2,3]}}; b = a.c b.v.push(4) a.c.v == [1,2,3,4]
[08:16:12] <Sandlayth> and thought doing it through a loop, and reassigning to the variable itself the child object
[08:16:24] <Sandlayth> nope, it's more a kind of
[08:17:32] <Sandlayth> var a = { foo: { [ bar: [ { foo2: [ bar3: "string" ] } ] } ] } } }
[08:17:43] <Sandlayth> nope
[08:17:45] <Sandlayth> looks like
[08:17:53] <Sandlayth> var a = { foo: { [ bar: [ { bar2: [ bar3: "string" ] } ] } ] } } }
[08:18:06] <Cork> Sandlayth: could you create a jsfiddle showing what you're trying to do?
[08:18:08] <Sandlayth> given that i don't know how many bar
[08:18:23] <Sandlayth> i would like too
[08:18:25] <Sandlayth> to
[08:18:36] <Sandlayth> but it's pretty drafty
[08:18:46] <Cork> Sandlayth: so make a short example
[08:18:52] <Sandlayth> ok
[08:18:56] <Cork> similarly to what i just created
[08:19:10] <Cork> but showing what you have problem with
[08:28:23] <Sandlayth> https://jsfiddle.net/Lc61569c/
[08:28:31] <Sandlayth> hope it's clear
[08:31:57] <tilerendering> cork: concerning my poll question earlier (got disconnected): you said there s no point in using a worker for periodically polling … what would your preferred approach be?
[08:32:30] <Cork> tilerendering: well if you specifically want a poll, just use an $.ajax call
[08:32:46] <Cork> tilerendering: xhr requests aren't blocking so it won't bog down the page
[08:33:11] <Cork> tilerendering: if you don't want to use polling i would recommend having a look at websocket; then you can pusha data without having to have a poll interval
[08:33:31] <Cork> s/pusha/push/
[08:33:31] <b-ot> Correction, <Cork> tilerendering: if you don't want to use polling i would recommend having a look at websocket; then you can push data without having to have a poll interval
[08:33:46] <tilerendering> hm!
[08:33:52] <tilerendering> not sure my app server can handle websockets
[08:34:16] <Cork> ya, if the server is written in php you're out of luck
[08:34:24] <Cork> else you might have luck
[08:34:55] <Sandlayth> Actually, I retrieve categories from a database. The category scheme is (id_parent, description). Thus, each category can have children, which can have children too, etc. At the beginning, i retrieve all categories inside an object with a JSON. I wait the user to enter something in the input to filter this object and only keep the tree which correspond to the input. Then, I genereate another input and fill
[08:34:56] <Sandlayth> its datalist with children corresponding to the given input. All that and I don'tknow yet how many children of children they could be (and consequently how many input will be generated)
[08:35:00] <tilerendering> it s in java, but I doubt I d want to move everything to websockets now. old java app server. anyhow...
[08:35:24] <tilerendering> are there any frameworks abstracting this kind of task away from the developer nicely, and specifically for this task? I currently just use jquery
[08:35:42] <Cork> tilerendering: you don't move everything to websocket
[08:36:02] <Cork> you use normal http for most communication, and websocket to push status changes
[08:36:20] <tilerendering> Cork: well, the message polling itself might make sense. then it would also make sense to have a node backend just for the messaging, however…
[08:36:31] <tilerendering> that implies a lot of other changes and considerations
[08:36:53] <Cork> tilerendering: there is also server-sent events
[08:36:56] <tilerendering> I m looking for some nice way of hiding away some of the complexity of periodical msg polling from the client side developing.
[08:37:00] <Cork> those are long poll based events https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events
[08:37:19] <tilerendering> Cork: still, anything you know for the client side?
[08:37:34] <TotallyNotKim> hey, some suggestions for zoomable graphs, that can handle live updates?
[08:37:37] <Cork> tilerendering: server-sent events are client side
[08:37:51] <Cork> it is just long get requests server side
[08:37:51] <tilerendering> great: ie no support, edge no support.
[08:38:12] <tilerendering> cork: believe me, I know why I m asking about client side support for periodical… as mentioned above.
[08:38:29] <Cork> ya, i miss read what you said
[08:38:50] <Cork> well there are ton of ways to do comet or long poll polling
[08:38:57] <tilerendering> I just need client side support for traditional periodical ajax polling, made as simpüle and abstracted away as good as possible
[08:39:01] <tilerendering> and as specific as possible
[08:39:05] <Cork> it isn't very hard, but it has a built in latency as it does polling
[08:39:13] <tilerendering> meaning: no need to use the framework for anything else than just that
[08:39:17] <Cork> ya
[08:39:24] <Cork> that is what i was talking about
[08:39:32] <tilerendering> ideally with something like growl support
[08:39:43] <Cork> basically just do an ajax call and in the callback when it ends set a timer to make a new one
[08:39:48] <Cork> it is as simple as that
[08:39:54] <tilerendering> I can google it, but I prefer asking ppl who are as reluctant to use unnecessary frameworks as me
[08:40:10] <tilerendering> cork: set the timer, + update the UI etc.
[08:40:15] <tilerendering> right
[08:40:22] <Cork> well the update ui is outside of what i talked about
[08:40:27] <Cork> just making the poll
[08:40:42] <tilerendering> yeah
[08:40:49] <tilerendering> but it would have to be done anyways
[08:40:57] <tilerendering> based on what kind of msgs
[08:41:07] <Cork> (function poll() { $.ajax(url).done(process).always(function() { setTimeout(poll, 1000); }) })();
[08:41:13] <Cork> ^ that is all you need
[08:41:34] <tilerendering> sure
[08:41:38] <tilerendering> thanks
[08:41:47] <Cork> "process" is a function that handles when you get data
[08:41:58] <Cork> the rest is just to keep the polling going
[08:42:46] <tilerendering> I can extend it I guess?
[08:43:02] <Cork> sure
[08:43:17] <Cork> that is the bare minimal to have a working poller
[08:43:27] <Cork> if you want more just change it
[08:43:55] <tilerendering> merci
[08:50:21] <tilerendering> Cork: that in combination with the observer pattern will enable me to quite cheaply do what I want
[08:51:33] <Cork> tilerendering: if you want to save cpu both client and server side you can extend it with a rAF to avoid executing the call unless the tab is active
[08:52:06] <Cork> its just a simple .always(function() { requestAnimationFrame(function() { setTimeout(poll, 1000); }); });
[08:52:12] <tilerendering> Cork: I guess facebook doesnt do that ...
[08:52:34] <tilerendering> (for instance)
[08:58:04] <TotallyNotKim> Cork: that's genius
[08:58:15] <TotallyNotKim> gonna throw that at my poller right away
[09:26:46] <TitaniumLeg> I'm running into the documented issue of Select2s not allowing search input in a Bootstrap modal in Firefox. Here is what I have tried: https://stackoverflow.com/q/48755763/7668467
[09:27:15] <TitaniumLeg> Do you all have any thoughts about why the documented fixes don't seem to work properly?
[09:27:42] <TitaniumLeg> My modal requires scrolling also, because it is a large modal
[09:37:25] <RonaldsMazitis> https://jsfiddle.net/tkbd1uwx/ " bind it to a parent and delegate the change event" how? parent is fileUploadForm ?
[09:39:25] <Cork> RonaldsMazitis: is the form a stable element; meaning it isn't replaced over and over?
[09:39:57] <RonaldsMazitis> no form changes in timeout
[09:40:07] <RonaldsMazitis> interval
[09:40:09] <Cork> so that rules it out
[09:40:12] <Cork> you need a stable parent
[09:40:31] <Cork> it doesn't have to be a direct parent though
[09:40:37] <RonaldsMazitis> <div class="outputchatuser" id="outputchatuser"></div>
[09:40:38] <Cork> so a grandparent is just fine
[09:40:49] <Cork> (modify the fiddle)
[09:41:01] <RonaldsMazitis> this is where it is loaded
[09:42:57] <RonaldsMazitis> should I make another div that this div with class="outputchatuser" is stored
[09:44:32] <RonaldsMazitis> https://jsfiddle.net/tkbd1uwx/1/
[09:48:42] <RonaldsMazitis> I am lost
[09:56:09] <tilerendering> Cork: concerning: “if you want to save cpu both client and server side you can extend it with a rAF to avoid executing the call unless the tab is active” (got carried away by work) - how would that work? just include a rAF in the callback?
[10:12:09] <RonaldsMazitis> $("#outputchatuser").delegate('file', "change", function() {
[10:14:38] <RonaldsMazitis> https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/event_on.asp
[10:26:08] <RonaldsMazitis> https://jsfiddle.net/deubva62/
[10:26:36] <RonaldsMazitis> I can't get value of the dom element after it is loaded
[10:27:01] <taplar> $.get is asynchronous
[10:27:28] <taplar> the request will not have finished by the time it gets to the line that is trying to get the value
[10:27:40] <RonaldsMazitis> why can't it be syncronous
[10:27:52] <RonaldsMazitis> it would make more sense
[10:27:54] <taplar> because synchronous web requests lock the browser
[10:27:58] <taplar> no, they don't
[10:28:13] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[10:28:34] <RonaldsMazitis> I can't learn from that, it's really gibberish
[10:29:08] <taplar> What is gibberish?  It explains in detail the topic
[10:29:37] <taplar> case in point
[10:29:39] <taplar> "Ajax requests are triggered by JavaScript code; your code sends a request to a URL, and when it receives a response, a callback function can be triggered to handle the response. Because the request is asynchronous, the rest of your code continues to execute while the request is being processed, so it's imperative that a callback be used to handle
[10:29:39] <taplar> the response."
[10:29:44] <taplar> very readable
[10:30:03] <RonaldsMazitis> that does not answer how can I do this

[10:56:48] <taplar> you don't

[11:24:26] <grapheti> console.log(reject)
[11:24:30] <taplar> if it's alerting the html, it sounds like you got your logic working

[13:30:56] <dang133> Hi, I'm getting an error in IE11.
[13:31:23] <robertmaxrees> what's the error?
[13:31:33] <dang133> My dev team recently upgraded to the latest version of JQUERY, and we get "permission denied" when we try to do just about anything using jquery.
[13:31:37] <dang133> Here are some examples
[13:31:55] <dang133> SCRIPT70: Permission denied
[13:32:03] <robertmaxrees> can you show us the code?
[13:32:06] <dang133> Thats when we try and open an iframe.
[13:32:24] <dang133> We also get permission denied with MOST, but not all, selectors
[13:32:35] <dang133> This fails: $('body')
[13:32:49] <dang133> $('body') fails
[13:32:54] <dang133> thats a good starting point.
[13:33:13] <dang133> We're using hte latest JQUERY UI, BLOCKUI, and JQUERY 3.2.1.
[13:33:13] <taplar> it's not really.  there shouldn't be any security concern with that
[13:33:19] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/78rrkcqg/
[13:33:19] <dang133> I tried 3.3, it didn't help.
[13:33:21] <robertmaxrees> seems fine.
[13:33:38] <robertmaxrees> in ie11
[13:33:58] <dang133> CHrome, FF, and Safari work fine for our code.
[13:34:04] <dang133> Only IE11 fails.
[13:34:19] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see more to understand what the problem might be.  that fiddle doesn't seem to have any issues.
[13:34:23] <dang133> And, legacy build of JQUERY work with IE tooo.
[13:34:39] <dang133> Should I be contacting Microsoft?
[13:34:44] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:34:48] <dang133> ?
[13:34:52] <robertmaxrees> microsoft doesn't maintain IE11 any more.
[13:35:03] <dang133> My understanding is that they do.
[13:35:13] <dang133> Edge isn't avail for Win7/8.
[13:35:15] <robertmaxrees> https://www.onmsft.com/news/microsoft-support-internet-explorer-11-starting-january-2016
[13:35:26] <robertmaxrees> win7/8 aren't supported any more, either.
[13:35:31] <robertmaxrees> *by microsoft.
[13:36:28] <robertmaxrees> it's hard to know what to suggest since i don't have your code in front of me.  i can tell you we aren't having those issues here.
[13:36:32] <robertmaxrees> so it sounds like something else is up.
[13:36:56] <dang133> hmm
[13:37:12] <dang133> In order to keep your personal info and files, safe and secure, stay up-to-date with Internet Explorer 11.
[13:37:20] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:37:25] <robertmaxrees> that's just marketing speak.
[13:37:29] <dang133>  thats from the article you sent me.  It states that IE 11 will get support.
[13:37:50] <dang133> "After January 12, 2016, Microsoft will no longer provide security updates or technical support for older Internet Explorer versions."
[13:37:50] <robertmaxrees> out of date.  one sec.
[13:37:56] <dang133> hodling.
[13:38:00] <dang133> holding...
[13:38:39] <robertmaxrees> ah that's right.  i misremembered.
[13:38:49] <robertmaxrees> either way, there's no reason to submit a bug to MS.
[13:39:18] <dang133> ok
[13:39:35] <robertmaxrees> can you provide a test case that shows the problem?
[13:39:45] <dang133> I cant' really give out the full source to our company's code.
[13:39:52] <dang133> Might you have some suggestions?
[13:39:54] <robertmaxrees> i'm not asking for full source though.
[13:40:12] <robertmaxrees> a test case is just the bare minimum required to trigger the bug.
[13:54:04] <dang133> @rob let me get back to you
[13:54:05] <dang133> Thanks.
[13:55:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:08:18] <cthulchu> folks, take a quick glance at my function please: function(){$("#promo_code_input").val() ? return $("#promo_code_input").val() : return "Null";}
[18:08:24] <cthulchu> what's wrong?
[18:09:12] <taplar> what issue are you seeing?  it's slightly odd that you have the return as part of the ternary
[18:09:18] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:09:53] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[18:09:59] <robertmaxrees> you can't do returns like that.
[18:10:25] <cthulchu> ok, I rewrote it like so: $("#promo_code_input").val()
[18:10:33] <cthulchu> return that
[18:10:41] <cthulchu> but why can't I do returns in a ternary?
[18:10:47] <cthulchu> that's a bit unexpected
[18:10:52] <taplar> ternary already returns as part of it's operation
[18:10:57] <cthulchu> aaaaaah
[18:11:06] <robertmaxrees> because conditionals expect expressions, not statements.
[18:11:07] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/37rq6mby/1/
[18:11:12] <cthulchu> right
[18:11:15] <taplar> also there may be a parse error with "return thing :"
[18:11:15] <cthulchu> thanks a lot
[18:11:21] <robertmaxrees> though the body could just be return $("#promo_code_input").val() || "Null";
[18:11:33] <cthulchu> that's what I do
[18:11:33] <robertmaxrees> though "Null" is kind of a weird thing to return.
[18:11:34] <cthulchu> thanks
[18:11:45] <cthulchu> right
[18:11:57] <cthulchu> I could return a bool
[18:12:00] <VeryBewitching> I've encountered something in jQuery I've never seen before, kind of looking for some advice.  I have an object with functions that return jQuery objects and I'm trying to call toggleClass; spitting out the object to the console after calling toggleClass shows the class I added, but inspecting the element in the DOM doesn't show it.
[18:12:33] <cthulchu> wow
[18:12:55] <cthulchu> maybe you're inspecting a wrong element
[18:12:57] <VeryBewitching> So one of these functions would be {field: function() { return $('#field_id'); }}; doing obj.field().toggleClass('alert', true);
[18:13:11] <VeryBewitching> I've confirmed it's the correct element
[18:13:33] <VeryBewitching> I wrapped the jQuery objects in a function to ensure it's being evaluated when I need it, too
[18:13:47] <robertmaxrees> does the DOM reflect it?
[18:14:21] <VeryBewitching> No, but if I console.log(obj); the console shows selector as input#id.input-small.alert
[18:14:31] <VeryBewitching> But the element when inspected only shows input-small
[18:14:55] <robertmaxrees> right
[18:14:56] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/M4xSEwi.png
[18:14:57] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[18:15:09] <robertmaxrees> oooh you're saying the class ISN'T displaying on the element.
[18:15:15] <robertmaxrees> gotta test case?>f
[18:15:23] <VeryBewitching> Yes.  A test case, no.
[18:15:26] <taplar> you are inspecting and not viewing source, right?
[18:15:31] <VeryBewitching> Inspecting, yes.
[18:15:41] <robertmaxrees> gotta screenshot at least?
[18:15:48] <VeryBewitching> Yes, that I can do, hold pls
[18:16:14] <taplar> also console.log($('[id="field_id"]').length);
[18:18:54] <VeryBewitching> So this is using console.log() https://pasteboard.co/H7w37bG.png
[18:19:15] <VeryBewitching> And this is when inspecting it https://pasteboard.co/H7w3iek.png
[18:19:38] <robertmaxrees> did you see taplar's suggestion?>
[18:19:41] <taplar> console.log($('[id="song_release_date"]').length);
[18:19:49] <VeryBewitching> Ah, kk, one sec
[18:21:32] <VeryBewitching> $("[id='song_release_date']").length; in a console produces 1
[18:21:44] <VeryBewitching> Which is what I'd expect.
[18:21:59] <robertmaxrees> something here isn'
[18:22:02] <robertmaxrees> *isn't adding up.
[18:22:11] <VeryBewitching> That's what I've been saying for the last hour
[18:22:29] <VeryBewitching> I use this function *a lot* and have never seen anything like this.
[18:22:41] <robertmaxrees> what if you use just addClass()?
[18:22:47] <VeryBewitching> Tried that too
[18:22:51] <robertmaxrees> same thing?
[18:23:20] <robertmaxrees> is anything removing that class?
[18:23:21] <VeryBewitching> Yup, the object $('#song_release_date') always has the class, but it's not in the DOM
[18:23:32] <VeryBewitching> Nope, I have one function responsible for this
[18:23:46] <robertmaxrees> you set a breakpoint for it and everything?
[18:24:19] <VeryBewitching> Yup; there's only way means of putting the class on the input
[18:24:43] <robertmaxrees> heh, sometimes things creep in, which is why a DOM breakpoint might reveal something funky.
[18:25:34] <VeryBewitching> Forgive how insane this looks, I haven't refactored anything yet:  https://gist.github.com/bewitchingme/5074afe87a77aba13f52c296cbc2723a
[18:26:02] <VeryBewitching> This method in my class is the only way this occurs.
[18:26:10] <robertmaxrees> that you're aware of :)
[18:26:24] <robertmaxrees> try doing something like inputs[input_name].field().toggleClass('foo', true)
[18:26:33] <robertmaxrees> see if that suddenly works./
[18:27:19] <VeryBewitching> Well sob
[18:27:54] <VeryBewitching> So foo shows up; hrm.
[18:39:43] <robertmaxrees> VeryBewitching so what does that tell you? :)
[18:41:04] <VeryBewitching> Not sure yet, but it's something I can grab a hold of at least.
[18:43:24] <VeryBewitching> And I think I found the issue.
[18:43:36] <robertmaxrees> mmyessss?
[18:48:55] <VeryBewitching> I have one modal and multiple records and I was trying to rush through this.
[18:49:14] <VeryBewitching> So it was being unset by the same routine, because subsequent records were valid.
[18:49:19] * VeryBewitching sighs.
[18:49:23] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:49:58] <VeryBewitching> Last thing I have to do for the day, and I have a fleet CTA in Eve at 9pm
[18:50:03] <VeryBewitching> So I was in a rush :)
[18:50:18] <robertmaxrees> hahah'
[21:57:01] <justinfeaner> I'm trying to display my preloader and remove it once the site loads but it doesn't seem to function properly the url is; alfie.lol
[22:18:35] <justinfeaner> ???
