[16:01:12] <yoshie902a> HI, I am applying a mask to an input. The mask works fine when keys are typed, but I need to mask applied on page load or refresh.  $('.input-mask').on('input', function(event) {}. What  “on” event do I need to use? I tried ‘load’ but that did not work
[16:01:52] <robertmaxrees> what plugin are you using?
[16:02:02] <robertmaxrees> can you make a jsfiddle? :)
[16:03:38] <yoshie902a> no plugin, just using an on(‘input’) event
[16:04:08] <yoshie902a> making js fiddle
[16:08:55] <yoshie902a> https://jsfiddle.net/j0v8u1gr/
[16:09:50] <robertmaxrees> ah - you need to abstract that function out and call it directly.
[16:10:13] <robertmaxrees> basically, invert the way you're using it now :)
[16:10:38] <yoshie902a> what do you mean?  I am a bit novice with JS
[16:11:17] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to make some adjustments, but basically: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p4gsked1/1/
[16:13:39] <robertmaxrees> so something like this (for a freebie: ly
[16:13:44] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p4gsked1/4/
[16:15:42] <yoshie902a> Got it, thank you, I would have never figured that out without spending 1 week on it. I’ve done that before.
[16:15:49] <yoshie902a> Really apprecaite it
[16:15:54] <robertmaxrees> totally. get the idea?
[16:16:08] <yoshie902a> yes, I neededto pass the object and event
[16:16:16] <robertmaxrees> not just that.
[16:16:28] <yoshie902a> and need to test that the event is there
[16:16:35] <yoshie902a> and then you can invert
[16:16:41] <robertmaxrees> but also: you needed to make the function more generic.
[16:16:44] <robertmaxrees> yeah exactly.
[16:16:50] <jnewt> i'm trying to write my own plugin for code reuse.   i'm following learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/  i am really struggling with the usage of $.functionName and $.fn.functionName and var functionName = function() differences.   I see them being used in different places, but don't understand why and am having several function not found issues that are probably related to the scope of these different methods.
[16:17:22] <yoshie902a> making my code more generic is something I need to work on
[16:17:32] <robertmaxrees> jnewt $.fn.functionName means you can do $('.foo').functionName();
[16:17:54] <robertmaxrees> $.functionName means it's a util you're attaching to $ - you'd access it by doing $.functionName();
[16:19:05] <robertmaxrees> jnewt where are you seeing var functionName = function?  or are you just confused about what that does?
[16:19:55] <robertmaxrees> yoshie902a a great place to start is to stop using inline anonymous functions :)
[16:20:44] <yoshie902a> yes, and it makes it more testable.
[16:20:49] <robertmaxrees> bingo.
[16:21:16] <robertmaxrees> and break logic out into small chunks - name functions for what they do.
[16:21:53] <robertmaxrees> like both of those functions contain identical logic to prevent the keypress based on some criteria.  lots of ways to abstract that out :)
[16:22:04] <jnewt> robertmaxrees: accepted answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1042072/how-to-call-functions-that-are-nested-inside-a-jquery-plugin they write a function that way and the have a return{ fxName : fxName}; which makes zero sense to me at this point.
[16:23:15] <robertmaxrees> jnewt because that's a contrived example explaining what var foo vs $.fn.foo means
[16:23:54] <robertmaxrees> and also how to make a plugin that returns chainable methods for just that plugin.
[16:24:11] <robertmaxrees> a "namespace" of source (though that's not the technically correct name)
[16:24:14] <robertmaxrees> *sorts
[16:27:56] <robertmaxrees> jnewt make sense?
[16:28:37] <yoshie902a> Weird result now, all my fields are displaying the same value now
[16:28:50] <robertmaxrees> yoshie902a ?
[16:29:12] <yoshie902a> on page load, I will try to put in js fiddle
[16:29:25] <robertmaxrees> yoshie902a do you have multiple .mask-integer-comma elements?
[16:29:44] <yoshie902a> yes, I have a lot
[16:29:49] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[16:29:52] <robertmaxrees> this assumes you have one.
[16:29:53] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[16:30:10] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p4gsked1/7/
[16:34:36] <yoshie902a> got it,so basically call a .each loop and call each individually
[16:34:38] <yoshie902a> thank you
[16:34:55] <robertmaxrees> yoshie902a yep.  otherwise you wind up calling it on all of them at once :)
[16:45:18] <yoshie902a> :-) thank you again!
[19:07:17] <sydbarret> google map and places api has a cost innit?
[19:07:31] <robertmaxrees> that is not a jquery question :)
[19:07:43] <sydbarret> but you have worked with it in jquery
[19:07:46] <sydbarret> im testing
[19:07:50] <robertmaxrees> i have no.
[19:07:52] <robertmaxrees> *not
[19:08:02] <sydbarret> you mean there is a free way of doing it?
[19:08:12] <sydbarret> you told me you had worked with autocomplete yesterday
[19:08:32] <robertmaxrees> i said i've used a few tools.  i never said anything about cost.
[19:08:48] <robertmaxrees> go check their documentation for pricing information.
[19:08:49] <sydbarret> but do you know a library for autocomplete places for free?
[19:08:56] <sydbarret> yes it has pricing
[19:09:34] <robertmaxrees> search google.  you'll see that there may be options based on, say, volume./
[19:12:14] <sydbarret> the sample im based on enabled 2 apis, one for maps and the other for places
[19:12:34] <sydbarret> but here https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places-autocomplete
[19:12:39] <robertmaxrees> cool
[19:12:40] <sydbarret> says autocomplete is free
[19:13:04] <robertmaxrees> https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/usage-and-billing
[19:13:04] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[19:13:18] <robertmaxrees> either way - offtopic for this channel.  good luck
[20:04:21] <Starship8010> Hi, I'd like to add a data-attribute to HTML that I get passed as a string, for example: <p>my string</p> -> <p data-rest="result">my string</p>
[20:04:39] <Starship8010> and then return the whole html
[20:05:14] <robertmaxrees> Starship8010 okay - where are you getting stuck?
[20:05:30] <Starship8010> var content = $(text).first().data('advice', advice)[0].outerHTML;
[20:05:34] <Starship8010> thats my attempt
[20:05:42] <Starship8010> where text is the html and advice the data element
[20:05:43] <robertmaxrees> mind making a fiddle?
[20:05:49] <Starship8010> sure, which platform?
[20:05:58] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle :)
[20:06:07] <Starship8010> ok, let me see how that works
[20:08:42] <Starship8010> ok got it
[20:08:52] <robertmaxrees> link?
[20:08:58] <Starship8010> https://jsfiddle.net/nd53hjuL/
[20:09:23] <Starship8010> result would be: <p data-advice="test">Hi</p>
[20:10:24] <robertmaxrees> so .data() doesn't add attributes.  it interfaces with a data object.  you want .attr() - literally one of a handful of times you should ever use .attr(), in face.
[20:10:26] <robertmaxrees> *fact
[20:10:34] <robertmaxrees> what's with that .first() in there?
[20:10:46] <Starship8010> ahhh ok i use attr
[20:11:13] <Starship8010> the html provided can have multiple elements. for example. <p>Hi</p><p>there</p>
[20:11:19] <robertmaxrees> that's not technically valid :)
[20:11:22] <Starship8010> i want to add the data attribute only to the first one
[20:11:33] <robertmaxrees> jquery needs a single root node.
[20:12:00] <Starship8010> so should wrap that in a div?
[20:12:05] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[20:12:08] <Starship8010> k
[20:12:13] <robertmaxrees> also: what browsers do you need to support?
[20:12:23] <Starship8010> all modern ones
[20:12:31] <robertmaxrees> IE11?
[20:12:35] <Starship8010> no
[20:12:53] <robertmaxrees> so why not use template strings instead?
[20:13:05] <Starship8010> what is that?^^
[20:13:22] <robertmaxrees> :) before i go there - how complex are these templates going to be?
[20:14:05] <Starship8010> not so complex
[20:14:21] <Starship8010> just some html, nested nodes too
[20:14:28] <robertmaxrees> because you may want to use an actual templating engine for this instead of rely on jquery - using jquery for stuff like this quickly gets out of hand.
[20:15:06] <Starship8010> got my example working now, yay
[20:15:14] <Starship8010> thanks :) what engine do you recommend to look into
[20:15:26] <Starship8010> (for now, i am happy with that but i might want to look into it later)
[20:16:10] <robertmaxrees> moustache and handlebars both come to mind.
[20:16:50] <Starship8010> ok, i will look into them
[20:30:04] <audiobirb> any datatables experts here?
[20:30:24] <robertmaxrees> you can try to ask but you'll likely have more luck on their forums :)
[20:39:14] <Starship8010> audiobirb just ask :)
[20:48:29] <audiobirb> wait are you even a cat
[20:48:54] <robertmaxrees> ?
[20:48:56] <audiobirb> jk, i need to know why me reinitialization of datatables is not working
[20:49:38] <audiobirb> when a user searches, i dynamically create html and destroy then initialize datatables on the generated table
[20:50:03] <audiobirb> currently im getting "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined"
[20:50:10] <robertmaxrees> doesn't datatables have a way to do that?
[20:50:14] <audiobirb> I searched on google and this is a problem with the structure of the data
[20:50:27] <audiobirb> but the data should come from the table itself
[20:50:42] <audiobirb> how do i make it so that the data source is the table and not some defined array
[20:50:51] <robertmaxrees> see my question :)
[20:50:56] <robertmaxrees> https://datatables.net/reference/api/search()
[20:51:16] <audiobirb> robertmaxrees: perhaps, but my use for datatables is specific. datatables' search function is limited. im creating a custom search function.
[20:51:31] <audiobirb> i need stacked searches, searches on specific columns, etc.
[20:51:44] <robertmaxrees> https://datatables.net/reference/api/column().search() :)
[20:51:51] <robertmaxrees> whatcha mean "stacked" searches?
[20:56:50] <robertmaxrees> lol
[21:52:19] <Starship809> Hi
[21:52:52] <robertmaxrees> ?
[22:10:55] <Starship809> i wanted to ask a question but cant get tinymce working in jsfiddle :|
[22:11:05] <robertmaxrees> what's the question?
[22:14:59] <robertmaxrees> Starship8010
[22:15:07] <Starship809> got it running now
[22:15:17] <Starship809> will post the fiddle in a sec
[22:15:18] <Starship809> and ask
[22:16:11] <robertmaxrees> lol ok?
[22:17:43] <Starship809> http://jsfiddle.net/2yp8jnda/
[22:18:03] <Starship809> what i am trying to do is find the exact position of every paragraph
[22:18:28] <robertmaxrees> Using tinymce?
[22:18:32] <Starship809> yes
[22:18:40] <robertmaxrees> :/ not really the right place for that.
[22:18:54] <Starship809> Oh yea Lol
[22:18:58] <robertmaxrees> heh
[22:19:14] <Starship809> I am the only one in #tinymce Lol
[22:19:26] <Starship809> crap, why dont they have a community that chats
[22:20:16] <robertmaxrees> lots don't.  they may have moved to another platform.
[22:36:22] <sydbarret> i have a table that will look like this https://pasteboard.co/JoeY6Uq.png
[22:37:06] <sydbarret> i need to make a survey with one question at a time and conditinal appearing of those based on previous answers. Questions need be pulled from table
[22:37:23] <sydbarret>  Basically i need to render all questions and then perhaps with jquery made them appear one by one?
[22:37:41] <sydbarret> or i could use ajax
[22:37:43] <robertmaxrees> cool.  so what's the question?
[22:38:09] <sydbarret> to post to a route
[22:38:12] <sydbarret> or view
[22:38:25] <sydbarret> and depending answer will retrieve ?
[22:38:26] <robertmaxrees> that's not a question lol.
[22:38:38] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to flesh out your server side first.
[22:38:45] <sydbarret> question is if you have a similar project so i can take a look
[22:38:47] <sydbarret> haha
[22:38:58] <sydbarret>  what do you mean flesh out
[22:39:01] <robertmaxrees> "hey can i have some of your previous work for free?"
[22:39:02] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[22:39:23] <sydbarret>   i will pay you 20 bucks
[22:39:26] <robertmaxrees> lmfao
[22:39:26] <sydbarret> i told you
[22:39:36] <robertmaxrees> something like that is worth much more than 20 dollars.
[22:39:42] <robertmaxrees> and this is the wrong place for that.
[22:39:53] <sydbarret> i could do it im just planning how
[22:40:00] <robertmaxrees> if you want help with jquery, great.  outside of that, wrong place.
[22:40:26] <robertmaxrees> break the problem down.  develop the server-side part first and figure out your endpoint(s), get those working, and then build out your frontend.
[22:40:28] <sydbarret> what language do you use for server ?
[22:40:35] <robertmaxrees> wrong question ;)
[22:40:55] <robertmaxrees> depends on the job, scalability, the developers, the available infrastructure, etc.
[22:41:36] <sydbarret> i think ajax would be more efficient innit
[22:41:44] <sydbarret> than rendering all the questions
[22:41:54] <sydbarret> and make them appear one by one?
[22:41:55] <robertmaxrees> what.
[22:42:04] <robertmaxrees> i'm talking server-side first.
[22:42:13] <sydbarret> server side is flask
[22:42:17] <sydbarret> i only know flask
[22:42:19] <robertmaxrees> can't do anything client-side, including ajax, until the server-side works.
[22:42:25] <sydbarret> i dont like php
[22:42:34] <robertmaxrees> nobody said anything about php??
[22:43:00] <sydbarret>  i was thinking something like https://github.com/frankV/flask_survey/blob/master/app/forms.py
[22:43:15] <robertmaxrees> that's a great question for a channel about flask/python.
[22:43:42] <sydbarret> yeah let me design that first
[22:43:49] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[22:44:00] <sydbarret> but with ajax will be hard
[22:44:03] <sydbarret> to have a progress bar
[22:44:04] <robertmaxrees> ajax is easy.
[22:44:05] <sydbarret> i guess
[22:44:20] <robertmaxrees> once you get your server-side set up, the client-side is very simple.
[22:44:38] <sydbarret> yeah let me solve that first
[22:44:47] <robertmaxrees> sadly, can't build the client-side until you have some semblance of API endpoints setup.
[22:45:34] <sydbarret> whats the logic in jquery to have a progress bar?
[22:45:48] <robertmaxrees> wut
[22:45:59] <sydbarret> i would need the total number of questions perhaps
[22:46:01] <robertmaxrees> that's a vague question.  what kind of progress bar?  like, for steps in a form?
[22:46:06] <sydbarret> but how you draw a progress var
[22:46:15] <sydbarret> so that user can see how much  is left
[22:46:19] <sydbarret> to finish survey
[22:46:32] <robertmaxrees> a containing element with child elements that you add/remove classes to that fill in with a color.
[22:47:01] <sydbarret> oh i see
