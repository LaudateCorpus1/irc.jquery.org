[00:39:10] <md_5> Best way to make text of some description (div for example) become a text box / control when clicked
[00:41:41] <Rotor> Hello !
[00:41:46] <gloomer> hi
[00:41:52] <gloomer> md_5 i dont really understand the question
[00:42:33] <md_5> gloomer like github for example, I can have a message for example and when I click the pencil next to it the message turns editable
[00:44:25] <Rotor> function createId(Id, buttonName)
[00:44:26] <Rotor> {
[00:44:26] <Rotor> 	return '#' + Id + '-' + buttonName;
[00:44:26] <Rotor> }
[00:44:26] <Rotor> this line show nothing :
[00:44:26] <Rotor> alert($(createId(Id,"Quantity")).html());
[00:44:28] <Rotor> but html page has :
[00:44:30] <Rotor> <p>QtÈ : <input type="text" id="4-Quantity" value="1" /><p>
[00:44:32] <Rotor> Can you help me please ? :)
[00:45:11] <gloomer> md_5 look for "jquery in place editing"
[00:45:14] <gloomer> plenty of plugins
[00:45:59] <md_5> thanks gloomer , mind suggesting one?
[00:46:19] <coldhead> Rotor: what does alert('input').html()); show?
[00:47:10] <gloomer> md_5 jeditable
[00:48:02] <joancreus> some dom elements are added dynamically somewhere else in the code. is there a way i can, from another part of the code, watch the selector (.live()-style) and have a callback when it's added?
[00:48:04] <joancreus> thanks
[00:48:05] <Rotor> coldhead : nothing ! (alert($('input').html())
[00:48:34] <Rotor> #4-Quantity is it a valid selector ?
[00:49:04] <coldhead> $('input') is a valid selector
[00:49:10] <coldhead> you should see something for that
[00:49:24] <coldhead> so its probably not a problem with the selector
[00:49:36] <coldhead> are you using .ready() ?
[00:49:59] <gloomer> http://jsfiddle.net/RNMtM/
[00:50:00] <gloomer> Rotor
[00:50:55] <joancreus> maybe it is an event? with plain javascript i could watch DOMSubtreeModified, maybe jquery offers something simpler
[00:50:56] <Rotor> .ready is used but with an id that i removed :D
[00:50:56] <b-ot> Rotor, memorised ‚Äúready‚Äù.
[00:52:09] <Rotor> hop favorite ! thx for jsfiddle.net :)
[00:54:42] <gloomer> joancreus http://jsfiddle.net/vJ3bX/
[00:55:35] <joancreus> gloomer: ok, this was the plain javascript approach i knew; i wondered if i could do $("input").live("add") or something like this
[00:55:59] <gloomer> live is deprecated
[00:56:45] <gloomer> but no jquery is just wrapping javascript so, just nicer syntax :)
[00:58:02] <Rotor> $(document).ready(function(){ don't solve my problem
[00:58:05] <Rotor> i create a sample
[00:58:56] <gloomer> Rotor did u look at mine http://jsfiddle.net/RNMtM/
[01:00:39] <Rotor> yes
[01:00:46] <Rotor> i adapt it !
[01:01:37] <md_5> gloomer is there a way I can make jeditable not require a postback url?
[01:03:16] <gloomer> not going to save changes?
[01:04:19] <Rotor> hop, it should be good : http://jsfiddle.net/RNMtM/1/
[01:04:42] <md_5> gloomer no, I want all changes to be saved at once via form submit
[01:08:18] <gloomer> md_5, look on stackoverflow the author is pretty prevelant there
[01:08:23] <gloomer> but it will definitly require some hacking
[01:32:46] <jita> how to get window.location.pathname with the query string ?
[02:34:46] <Ankabout> anyone have an example of a simple image rotator? I have a number of images in a folder, and it should just shuffle through them one by one. not sure what to google for...
[02:36:42] <gloomer> mhttp://download.cnet.com/Batch-JPEG-Rotator/3000-12511_4-10577894.html
[02:39:16] <Ankabout> oh sorry gloomer, I meant swapping between images, like a slideshow (no effects)
[02:42:06] <coldhead> Ankabout:  http://t.co/SlFvC16C ?
[02:44:15] <Ankabout> coldhead, that's pretty cool
[02:44:35] <Ankabout> not what I need, but very psychadeliv
[02:44:40] <Ankabout> psychadelic
[02:44:46] <Ankabout> or however you spell that
[02:46:11] <coldhead> psychedelic
[02:47:11] <Ankabout> ah yeah that's it :)
[02:47:36] <Ankabout> it seems so simple what I need though. folder of images, show each one 2 seconds, and cycle through them
[02:49:02] <coldhead> http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/ ?
[02:49:58] <Ankabout> yeah that's getting there. it's the part where it simply looks for images in a folder rather than having the images coded into the html that I'm struggling with
[02:50:09] <Ankabout> sorry, late night, i'm not too clear today :P
[02:51:10] <coldhead> javascript can't (generally) acceess the file system
[02:51:18] <coldhead> so it can't find the files in a folder
[02:51:25] <coldhead> it has to be told somehow
[02:51:34] <coldhead> unless you do it some fancy html5 way
[02:52:29] <Ankabout> ah ok. well we can deal with that then
[02:54:57] <Ankabout> thanks
[03:22:49] <jita> Anybody help me with me http://stage.45sec.com/business/feedbacks/ ?? If i click on next pagination button the window seem to dance. The event that is triggering it is soundmanager.reboot(). Any ideas ?

[03:32:40] <IvanKuzev> sorry
[03:33:01] <An_Ony_Moose> does $("#someelement").text("new value"); not work in chrome?
[03:33:27] <An_Ony_Moose> I'm using it but it seem to raise exceptions in chromium and chrome, while working perfectly fine in firefox
[03:35:57] <IvanKuzev> shoud work.
[03:36:20] <IvanKuzev> unless something else is wrong
[03:36:23] <An_Ony_Moose> IvanKuzev: it doesn't. Neither in chromium, nor chrome, and I just tried it in safari as well
[03:36:35] <An_Ony_Moose> it's only working in firefox
[03:41:21] <postoy> if( $wolf ) { $(this).get( $petkernel)  }
[03:41:38] <An_Ony_Moose> huh... it works in JSFiddle
[03:42:44] <postoy> else {  $runlikehell }
[03:46:30] <An_Ony_Moose> oh I fixed it... I had to add the element to the document before I could use it (except in Fx)
[03:48:29] <IvanKuzev> did you really expect it to do something?
[03:48:57] <postoy> Ivan: you actually have a wolf?
[03:49:17] <postoy> IvanKuzev: you actually have a wolf?
[03:49:37] <IvanKuzev> no..i wanted to write "woof"
[03:49:55] <postoy> what's a woof?
[03:50:57] <IvanKuzev> its a program that makes you a very tiny linux from packages ..see http://puppylinux.com/
[03:57:54] <postoy> IvanKuzev: You sounded much more mysterious being Russian and owning a wolf. ;)
[03:59:56] <IvanKuzev> not russian too:)
[04:02:49] <astropirate> i owned a wolf...
[04:02:54] <astropirate> when I used to live in afghanistan
[04:03:05] <astropirate> << certified badass :D
[04:26:07] <SmokingSlim> divWidth = divs[0].width, im wondering why this is not working?
[04:26:11] <SmokingSlim> any suggestions?
[04:26:45] <SmokingSlim> the DOM resturns a "NaN"
[04:28:18] <astropirate> SmokingSlim, try $(divs[0]).width()
[04:28:47] <SmokingSlim> astropirate
[04:28:54] <SmokingSlim> ops, client error... divs = containerUL.find('div'),
[04:28:54] <astropirate> SmokingSlim
[04:28:54] <SmokingSlim>         divWidth = divs[0].width,
[04:29:04] <SmokingSlim> shouldn't that be correct?
[04:29:22] <astropirate> what is containerUL?
[04:29:29] <astropirate> is that a jquery object?
[04:29:46] <SmokingSlim> var containerUL = $('div.container').children('ul'),
[04:29:46] <SmokingSlim>         divs = containerUL.find('div'),
[04:29:49] <SmokingSlim> its a variable
[04:29:57] <astropirate> ohh and now it shouldnt
[04:30:12] <astropirate> sec lemme try something
[04:30:25] <SmokingSlim> ill post a jsfiddle, hang on
[04:33:27] <SmokingSlim> http://jsfiddle.net/VdrdY/ astropirate, it kinnda works if you remove the [0] and use the width() but the back button doesn't reset when hitting back
[04:36:37] <astropirate> SmokingSlim,
[04:36:38] <astropirate> lol
[04:36:49] <astropirate> divslen  what are you trying to get here?
[04:36:50] <SmokingSlim> ?
[04:36:53] <astropirate> the length of the array?
[04:37:17] <astropirate> i'm confused
[04:37:30] <astropirate> and use $(divs[0]).width()
[04:38:16] <SmokingSlim> the total amout of divs within the ul child is divsLen, the divsLen * divWith is the total amout of pixelwith
[04:38:41] <SmokingSlim> atm there are two divs in the ul child (2 * 300px)
[04:45:26] <SmokingSlim> yeah well... chuck testa code
[05:00:00] <techouse> question: what's the official release of jquery now?!

[05:00:32] <techouse> topic says 1.8.0, http://jquery.com/download/ says 1.8.0, http://jquery.com/ says 1.8.1
[05:01:01] <techouse> 1.8.0 is hosted on google an microsofts's cloud servers, 1.8.1 isn't
[05:01:12] <techouse> not even on jquery's own cloud
[05:10:10] <SmokingSlim> got it to work with clientWidht method
[05:10:15] <funnyboy243> Try asking the Milk Mystic.

[06:17:18] <anoob> I want to check with PHP if a request was made with jquery's ajax ... x-requested-with is not set anymore ... how could i check it? thanks
[06:21:36] <johnkpaul> anoob: why is x requested with not set anymore? is this a cross domain request?
[06:22:05] <anoob> johnkpaul, it isnt ... thank you
[06:22:09] <astropirate> if its a cross domain request, the browser shoudlnt even make the request
[06:22:32] <johnkpaul> astropirate: why not? depends on if server side is setup to use CORS
[06:22:40] <johnkpaul> anoob: hm, I don't know why x requested with would _not_ be set
[06:22:44] <johnkpaul> ?demo @ anoob
[06:22:45] <bot-t> anoob, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[07:05:05] <knowj> How do I get the value from the entry.thumbnail object from this json parse: http://pastebin.com/4wCHkaq9?
[07:05:21] <knowj> Still can't get my head around javascript object structures :S
[07:06:31] <Lucky--> knowj: the this function in js changes scope, change them to named vars
[07:06:35] <Lucky--> thats the first step ind ebugging
[07:07:21] <knowj> sorry my javascript/jquery is pretty poor at this level I'm a PHP developer by trade
[07:07:56] <knowj> change them to named vars?
[07:08:27] <Lucky--> yea
[07:08:50] <knowj> sorry I'm being stupid I don't get what you mean/how to do it
[07:08:58] <Lucky--> var myvar1 = this
[07:08:59] <knowj> I'm sure it will be a facepalm moment
[07:09:30] <Lucky--> $(data).each(function(){ code; });
[07:09:44] <Lucky--> $(data).each(function(item){ item.DoSomething(); });
[07:11:37] <knowj> Do you mean Im basically going to have to assign entry.thumbnail then loop on it?
[07:12:51] <knowj> in php i would just need to do something like $entry->thumbnail->sqDefault
[07:13:27] <Lucky--> knowj: basically in jquery you can do $(selector).functiontoperform(arguments);
[07:13:34] <Lucky--> where selector is a variable, or a
[07:13:44] <Lucky--> item, dom element, etc ,etc
[07:15:27] <knowj> Either I'm being really slow and not grasping what your saying or I haven't explained the issue very well. I'm getting results from var title= entry.title; if I console.log(title)
[07:16:28] <ajpiano> Lucky--: $( elems ).each( fn ) is for ... elements
[07:16:35] <Lucky--> yes
[07:16:36] <ajpiano> if he has an object or array, $.each( foo, fn) is correct
[07:16:44] <knowj> however var thumbnail = entry.thumbnail is an object containing sqDefault and hqDefault. I just want to assign sqDefault to var thumbnail
[07:16:44] <Lucky--> works either way
[07:17:01] <ajpiano> Lucky--: that's immaterial
[07:17:06] <knowj> so basically trying to do var thumbnail = entry.thumbnail.sqDefault
[07:17:09] <ajpiano> it's incorrect to use $(obj).each
[07:17:35] <ajpiano> anyhow
[07:19:24] <knowj> but that doesn't work for whatever reason ^^
[07:20:21] <ajpiano> it's a lot better to use the  argument than the 'this' inside of an $.each( foo, function( bar, baz ) { }); thing
[07:20:39] <ajpiano> you should prefer "baz" to 'this' because IIRC you get the "boxed" value otherwise
[07:20:57] <ajpiano> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide29
[07:25:25] <knowj> I've removed the this references but still left with getting the var thumbnail = entry.thumbnail.sqDefault value from http://pastebin.com/0hxemw4j
[07:26:29] <knowj> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'sqDefault' of undefined
[07:26:38] <ajpiano> it's weird that it i think you are making a bad assumption about the data
[07:26:41] <ajpiano> i mean,
[07:26:47] <ajpiano> i think you are making a bad a ssumpion about the data
[07:26:50] <ajpiano> look at the output
[07:27:00] <ajpiano> https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/NottinghamLionsTV/uploads?v=2&alt=jsonc&format=5
[07:27:03] <ajpiano> there are two top level keys
[07:27:07] <ajpiano> apiVersion and data
[07:28:26] <Woet> is there a recommend jquery plugin/method for creating offline mode?
[07:28:35] <Woet> I found https://github.com/wycats/jquery-offline but it seems out of date
[07:29:21] <knowj> ajpiano: Parsing with javascript/jquery is new to me, it seems to be completely different from outputting from PHP
[07:34:44] <Woet> i found https://github.com/jeremydurham/persist-js too, not sure which would be better
[07:36:45] <ajpiano> knowj: this should help http://jsbin.com/ovoceg/1/
[07:36:56] <ajpiano> knowj:  you have to actually look at the structure of the object you're trying to "parse"
[07:37:07] <ajpiano> you can't just blindly start doing nested loops until you think you're inside the thing you want to be inside of
[07:37:53] <ajpiano> also wow, english national ice hockey league
[07:37:58] <ajpiano> there's a thing i didn't know existed
[07:39:26] <ajpiano> now we have both learned something
[07:39:27] <knowj> ajpiano: Thanks that makes alot more sense. We have 4 main levels of Ice hockey league Elite, EPL, ENL1, ENL2
[07:39:28] <calistor> Hi. How to access a var inside a jquery-function? I i'd like to access v1,v2 or v3. http://jsfiddle.net/5h3ev/
[07:39:56] <ajpiano> knowj: works the same as football i presume, what with promtions and relegations and all that
[07:40:49] <ajpiano> calistor: the "myfunc" function isn't ever getting executed
[07:41:06] <ajpiano> you're just defining it inside of a closure, that doesn't mean it's firing
[07:42:16] <knowj> ajpiano: Unfortunately football is the dominant sport here. Would love to have NHL level over here.
[07:42:46] <ajpiano> yea unfortunately you're up against the NHL and the entirety of eastern europe as well
[07:42:52] * ajpiano says as he turns on FIFA
[07:42:52] <ajpiano> :D
[07:44:05] <knowj> ajpiano: At least they don't cry on FIFA
[07:44:17] <williamson37015> I've made plugin, I'm trying to make it so, with each interval, I'm trying to add class to the next and remove class of the previous, and when it reaches the last item restart again http://jsfiddle.net/williamson37015/KtwsA/
[07:44:17] <knowj> needs the realism adding in
[07:44:50] <ajpiano> calistor: http://jsfiddle.net/5h3ev/2/
[07:45:15] <ajpiano> knowj: yeah, leaves all the tears for me and my complete inability to weight my passes ... and shots
[07:45:16] <ajpiano> :(
[07:45:34] <calistor> ajpiano, that helped me alot.
[07:45:41] <calistor> ajpiano, thank
[07:46:07] <ajpiano> :)
[07:57:01] <calistor> ajpiano, why won't the following one work: http://jsfiddle.net/5h3ev/3/
[07:57:51] <calistor> ajpiano, when the function is called from outside the (function ($) ...
[08:00:37] <knowj> ajpiano: In firefox I'm getting reaponse.data is undefined :S?
[08:00:51] <knowj> ajpiano: would that be a permissions issue accessing an external domain?
[08:01:44] <ajpiano> calistor: because functions aren't automatigically jquery plugins
[08:01:54] <calistor> :)
[08:01:56] <ajpiano> defining a function foo() { } doesn't define $.fn.foo
[08:02:16] <ajpiano> knowj: yeah, i was kind of surprised that it was working in jsbin, lol
[08:02:22] <ajpiano> theoretically you'd have to use JSONP
[08:02:34] <knowj> JSONP?
[08:02:59] <ajpiano> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP
[08:03:10] <ajpiano> it's a hack around the cross domain thing that works well enough
[08:03:50] <knowj> ah that's the standard javascript method listed on the youtube api docs
[08:04:31] <knowj> can you get jsonp to play nicely with jquery with the jQuery(document).ready(function() {
[08:04:44] <ajpiano> yes
[08:04:49] <ajpiano> jquery supports jsonp relatively transparently
[08:06:07] <ajpiano> for some weird reason though YouTube's api sends back JSONP with a leading comment
[08:09:11] <williamson37015> Can Anyone Help?
[08:09:28] <ajpiano> knowj: all you have to do is add dataType:"jsonp" to the ajax rquest and it seems to be fine
[08:09:37] <ajpiano> http://jsbin.com/ovoceg/2/edit appears to work fine in ff
[08:11:52] <knowj> ajpiano: Brilliant thanks. I don't get to what benefit creating cross site requests adds if you can bypass it so easily
[08:12:06] <ajpiano> knowj: sites have to expose a JSONP api
[08:12:33] <ajpiano> knowj: you can't just force any site to give you data cross domain by making a jsonp request
[08:13:13] <knowj> ajpiano: fair point. But then you could just serverside the request and call the data locally
[08:13:30] <ajpiano> knowj: yep, you can do that
[08:14:02] <ajpiano> but that's not the same as making a remote request directly from the clientside
[08:15:32] <aibo> hi
[08:15:48] <aJacom> hi. I'm looking to make a table show up by animating it so that it shows up one row at a time, vertically, and with a fadein effect on each one. any tips on how to make it ?
[08:16:18] <aibo> aJacom: with animate() and html()?
[08:16:24] <williamson37015> I've made plugin, I'm trying to make it so, with each interval, I'm trying to add class to the next and remove class of the previous, and when it reaches the last item restart again http://jsfiddle.net/williamson37015/KtwsA/ . Someone Please Help Me
[08:16:52] <aJacom> aibo, seems like slidetoggle is pretty close..
[08:17:41] <SmokingSlim> any1 wanna try and fix the "previous" button error? http://jsfiddle.net/VdrdY/2/
[08:19:03] <aibo> aJacom: then use slidetoggle and use a queue to animate each row
[08:20:51] <aibo> aJacom: or maybe look at this: http://stackoverflow.com/a/3410943
[08:23:44] <aibo> I'm trying to write my own undo/redo-manager, and i planned using a queue. is it possible to dequeue an entry of the queue and simulataneously write it to another queue? (queue function in undo-queue, then dequeue it and write it to the redo-queue)
[08:23:47] <aJacom> thanks for the help aibo, that works pretty good. although for some strange reason, a simple $("#tableid").slideToggle("slow"); doesn't animate, it just toggles visibility instantly
[08:24:56] <aibo> aJacom: yea, the first answer says u can't use slidetoggle on tablerows itself, needs a div to work
[08:26:13] <ajpiano> aibo: basic array methods are your friends here
[08:26:31] <aJacom> ah. thanks
[08:27:05] <ajpiano> aibo: undoQueue.unshift( redoQueue.shift() );
[08:29:22] <aibo> ajpiano: thank you! i couldn't find docs about the basic operations for the queue!

[08:31:56] <aibo> here's my general problem i'm trying to solve, maybe the array/queue isn't the best option.
[08:32:21] <williamson37015> It will not remove the class of  uiCurr from the first item and add to the next and so on and so forth
[08:32:51] <aibo> i'm writing a kind of wysiwyg editor ( i know there are plenty arround) and i'm combining the execcommands with jquery operations
[08:33:08] <ajpiano> williamson37015: if you had a removeClass in here somewhere, that would be a lot more surprising
[08:33:59] <aibo> the problem here is, execcommand('undo', false) works like a charm but if i'm using a jquery function to manipulate the content i can't use execcommand(undo) to undo my jquery manipulation
[08:34:02] <ajpiano> williamson37015: it's also not clear to me how aliasing object references to *even longer* variable names somehow helps with cutting down repetition
[08:34:36] <ajpiano> williamson37015: the important question is, how are you debugging this
[08:34:48] <ajpiano> are you just writing some code, expecting it to work one way, and now wondering why it doesn't?
[08:34:58] <williamson37015> ajpiano : any suggestion and I've tried it, it removes the class then adds it to the next one, HOWEVER, it adds it to the next one and the next one, without removing it from the previous one
[08:35:00] <aibo> so i'm trying to write my own undo/redo history, a combination of execcommand(undo) and a function to undo a jquery action... my idea was to use a queue or array to do so... maybe there's a better alternative?
[08:35:31] <ajpiano> instead of step-debugging the program to see which of your conditions is being hit, what you're actually selecting, etc
[08:35:44] <ajpiano> aibo: sounds complicated
[08:36:08] <aibo> ajpiano: yeah it kinda is :D
[08:36:14] <ajpiano> figuring out how to "undo" a DOM manipulation doesn't sound like a trivial task
[08:36:46] <williamson37015> and I don't know what program to use to debug ://
[08:36:55] <ajpiano> williamson37015: you use chrome developer tools or firebug
[08:36:57] <ajpiano> ?ftj @ williamson37015
[08:36:58] <bot-t> williamson37015, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[08:37:06] <williamson37015> chrome dev
[08:37:27] <ajpiano> williamson37015: just so you have a bit of context, tehre's a lot to unwind here and someone who wants to help you fix this would probably need to spend about an hour explaining a lot of different things
[08:37:31] <aibo> ajpiano: i thought i just push a function to the undo list which just does the opposite of the used jquery manipulation...
[08:37:48] <williamson37015> :(
[08:37:50] <ajpiano> and unfortauntely that is not an hour i have right now :(
[08:38:03] <ajpiano> aibo: what is the "opposite" of .append()
[08:38:06] <ajpiano> .prepend()
[08:38:09] <ajpiano> or remove()?
[08:38:10] <ajpiano> etc
[08:38:17] <riku> http://jsfiddle.net/9xCbJ/ - Is there a way to modify the this.getPosition() method so that the values cannot be changed outside the object?
[08:38:38] <aibo> just what fits my needs in the context
[08:38:44] <aibo> so i would use remove
[08:39:12] <ajpiano> riku: is this what you mean http://jsfiddle.net/9xCbJ/1/
[08:39:24] <williamson37015> By the way, what does Missing 'use strict' statement.
[08:39:26] <williamson37015> mean?
[08:39:38] <riku> ajpiano: yeah
[08:40:30] <ajpiano> williamson37015: the newest version of ECMAscript (the language javascript is a subset of), ES5, has a "strict mode" that defines certian behaviour
[08:40:40] <ajpiano> but like, that really should not be having any effect on your apps or code given where you are
[08:41:08] <riku> ajpiano: ty btw :)
[08:41:13] <aibo> ajpiano: my plan is every undoable jquery function adds a matching undo-method to the undo-queue... but i feel a little stupid about the approch, there has to be another way :(
[08:41:40] <williamson37015> ajpiano do you have any ideas on how to make my plugin more effecient?
[08:42:03] <ajpiano> i mean, you should not have "options" be a global variable
[08:42:12] <ajpiano> you shouldn't use .children(":first") you should use .children().first()
[08:42:29] <ajpiano> aliasing all those things to more verbose variables with a repetetive string is an odd choie from a stylistic perspective
[08:42:46] <ajpiano> you don't need to concatenate empty strings onto the end of strings
[08:42:52] <ajpiano> $("."+foo) is sufficient
[08:43:18] <ajpiano> and yes, if at some point you are hoping to have a class get removed, having removeClass somewhere in the code would be helpful
[08:44:08] <ajpiano> williamson37015: i realise that's a lot of things and there's even more that could be improved
[08:44:28] <williamson37015> like?
[08:44:43] <ajpiano> but at the moment i can only help with a few tips and tricks, not a full fledged tutoring session :)
[08:45:22] <ajpiano> like caching your references etc
[08:45:40] <ajpiano> once you initialise the plugin, you shouldn't be having to go back to a dom query to re-find the entire items list
[08:45:56] <ajpiano> williamson37015: what might help would be to look at the code of a similar tool
[08:46:03] <ajpiano> a different open source scroller/cycler or whatever
[08:46:08] <ajpiano> so you can see how it keeps track of state
[08:46:12] <ajpiano> and element references
[08:46:25] <williamson37015> ok
[08:46:39] <ajpiano> i think that's the best recommendation i can make short of spending a few hours walking you throughthis
[08:46:50] <ajpiano> which would be great but also i can't :(
[08:48:07] <BinaryKitten> not for the amount you get paid to be in this channel aJacom
[08:48:14] <BinaryKitten> * ajpiano
[08:49:27] <ajpiano> :)
[08:49:44] <BinaryKitten> ajpiano when are you getting that raise
[08:50:00] <BinaryKitten> from nothing to nothing with occaisional praise and thanks
[08:50:08] <ajpiano> hehee
[08:50:28] <BinaryKitten> ajpiano is yayquery ever coming back?
[08:50:43] <ajpiano> skeptical
[08:51:08] * BinaryKitten misses it
[09:10:37] <halim> hello, i have a div where i present ajax information to the user, when an ajax request is made, it contains the string: "Loading" and on ajaxComplete it's set back to contain an empty string. the problem is that, ajaxComplete overwrites ajaxError
[09:10:54] <halim> is there a way to check whether there was an error in the ajaxComplete event?
[09:12:26] <halim> oh, i'm going to use ajaxSuccess instead of ajaxComplete
[09:12:30] <halim> this should solve my problem
[09:30:08] <williamson37015> ajpiano do you have anyy other resources for plugin dev
[09:33:06] <BinaryKitten> ajpiano do you think that we could raise money to pay for a new yayQuery podcast episode?
[09:41:39] <F1skr> So I have a bunch of ajax-requests and I use the "when" method to know when they are all done, that works fine but what I really want to know is when the ajax-request is done, AND the reponse has been "processed" by the ajaxSuccess callback. Is this possible?
[09:47:55] <arielserafini> F1skr: you can use trigger() to fire a custom event
[09:53:18] <F1skr> arielserafini: I don't see how that could be used?
[09:54:16] <arielserafini> I'm no expert and i'm not sure I understood your problem
[09:54:45] <arielserafini> but you can fire a custom event on your ajaxSuccess function
[09:55:13] <arielserafini> or if you need to know then they are ALL done, I guess you'll have to implement a counter or something like that
[09:55:21] <arielserafini> maybe push to an array and check
[10:03:42] <sunbeam> how to make all input fields with a certain class readonly='readonly'
[10:03:43] <sunbeam> ?
[10:05:30] <F1skr> sunbeam: $('input').attr('readonly', 'readonly');
[10:05:54] <F1skr> I guess you mean attribute rather than class (as in css class)?
[10:06:45] <sunbeam> ok
[10:06:49] <sunbeam> yes sorry
[10:07:34] <Oxymandias> question about event binding with JQuery.  I have a generic animation function doCoolStuff(elt), where elt is a JQuery object.  I want to bind it to the mouseover functions of a number of different elements.
[10:07:43] <Oxymandias> the n00b answer would be something like: for (elt in myelements) { elt.mouseover( function() { doCoolStuff(elt) } ) }
[10:07:50] <Oxymandias> my suspicion is that this won't work because the value of elt will have been reassigned by the time the handler actually gets called.  is that correct?  if so, how do I pull this off?  thx
[10:12:36] <Oxymandias> anyone?
[10:33:45] <Oxymandias> never mind, worked it out.  I redefine doCoolStuff(curr_elt) { return function() { //insert cool stuff relating to curr_elt here} } and then set the handler to doCoolStuff(elt)
[10:34:03] <Oxymandias> hooray for functional programming
[10:34:19] <F1skr> Oxymandias: word
[10:38:06] <digs> So, I need some help with optimization.
[10:38:50] <gloomer> digs whats on what
[10:38:52] <digs> I have a page that will have up to 100 addresses loaded. The first time the user reaches this page, their addresses are not verified with FedEx. So, I begin making calls to the FedEx API Server to verify each address.
[10:39:19] <digs> So, the page is essentially locked up until this completes. These are AJAX calls made via jquery.
[10:39:29] <gloomer> whats your backend?
[10:39:31] <digs> On success, it updates a div with the FedEx address.
[10:39:38] <digs> PHP, MySQL.
[10:40:14] <CookAnEgg> Bonsoir.
[10:40:15] <F1skr> digs, ajax is async so the page shouldn't be locked up?
[10:40:49] <digs> Well, the page doesn't "grow". I can give you a login to a test account to see what I mean.
[10:41:08] <gloomer> sure
[10:41:10] <digs> And... chrome wants to kill the page after a few, (sometimes)
[10:41:24] <digs> okay one second.
[10:44:41] <gloomer> altho without even looking my first reaction is to use an ajax engine like comet or ape, signalR
[10:45:09] <gloomer> load the page and update as data is returned from fedex
[10:45:41] <digs> I gave you the creds via pm.
[10:45:45] <F1skr> should be very easy with just jquery
[10:46:24] <digs> Yeah, I don't know what the issue is.
[10:46:38] <ajpiano> are you making 100 requests all at once?
[10:46:43] <digs> I don't know enough to track down my problem.
[10:46:45] <calistor> Hey ajpiano, you where right about the jquery-plugin, but how can i access variables inside a cusotm jq-plugin method? $.fn.myfunc = function(opts) {
[10:46:45] <calistor>         alert('executed');
[10:46:45] <calistor>         var v1 = 'V1';
[10:46:45] <calistor>         this.v2 = 'V2';
[10:46:45] <calistor>         v3 = 'V3';
[10:46:45] <calistor>         // do stuff
[10:46:45] <calistor>         window.v4 = "V4";
[10:46:46] <calistor> }
[10:46:46] <calistor> $('div.test').myfunc();
[10:46:47] <calistor> alert( typeof v1 );
[10:46:48] <ajpiano> OMGOMGOM
[10:46:48] <ajpiano> omg
[10:46:48] <calistor> alert(v2);
[10:46:49] <calistor> alert(v3);
[10:46:50] <calistor> alert(v4);
[10:46:51] <digs> No, they are being fired off one by one.
[10:46:56] <calistor> oops Sorry guys"
[10:47:11] <calistor> wrong clipboard
[10:47:11] <ajpiano> digs: are you doing async: false ?
[10:47:27] <calistor> ajpiano, http://jsfiddle.net/5h3ev/4/
[10:47:35] <ajpiano> calistor: you need to learn more about js :p
[10:47:45] <calistor> ajpiano, i know :(
[10:48:02] <ajpiano> there's no reason for you to need to "access" those things globally
[10:48:21] <ajpiano> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[10:48:30] <digs> ajpiano - no.
[10:48:36] <calistor> well i have plugin "cloud-zoom" id like to grab a property and check some "state"
[10:49:47] <shoky> calistor i once updated that plugin to be a little nicer to work with. and just rewrote parts of it to be better
[10:49:49] <shoky> want?
[10:49:59] <calistor> want! :)
[10:50:00] <ajpiano> digs: i can take a quick look
[10:50:02] <shoky> k sec

[10:57:15] <jquser> Hello. I have written jq script that does not work after refresh. It does not work again when I close firefox and load page again. It start's working after deleting cache. It is not intended by requested functionality to store any data in cache by  this script.. Is it a common problem?
[10:57:44] <jquser> Ah, I try to refresh when script crash
[10:57:59] <ravenzz> ?demo @ jqlog
[10:58:00] <bot-t> jqlog, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[10:59:30] <LoneStar99> anyone know how to make a suggestive search work with arrow keys up and down like yelp.com ?
[10:59:40] <shoky> calistor: you can find the .js and .css in 'manage resources' on the left
[10:59:47] <calistor> shoky, thanks a lot!
[11:01:19] <shoky> calistor: ahh wait there's a newer version
[11:01:33] <shoky> calistor: i mean i linked to the older one there. sec.
[11:01:39] <calistor> shoky, ok
[11:02:33] <jquser> ravenzz: in fiddle issue is not present
[11:02:48] <shoky> calistor: ok if you reload it i think the new .js and .css should be loaded.
[11:03:00] <shoky> calistor: see if the "Zoom It" button works
[11:03:21] <calistor> shoky, works. Thanks man!
[11:03:26] <shoky> ;]

[11:04:13] <calistor> shoky, "Zoom it": titties first, then face lol :)
[11:04:22] <jquser> hmm
[11:04:26] <shoky> ;D finally someone appreciates my work

[11:06:28] <rgr> Is there a utility/jquery shortcut to convert a form containing divs, sub divs etc, but ultimately input and textares
[11:06:49] <rgr> Is there a utility/jquery shortcut to convert a form containing divs, sub divs etc, but ultimately input and textareas into a datarecord (inputs can include text and checkboxes)
[11:07:22] <jquser> Great thing about hardware is it can be fixed using hammer. Soft cannot
[11:07:25] <arielserafini> what's a datarecord?
[11:08:23] <gloomer> $('#form').serialize()?
[11:08:27] <arielserafini> rgr: isn't serialize() what you want?
[11:08:30] <arielserafini> what he said :)
[11:08:38] <ravenzz> jquser software can be fixed debugging ;)
[11:09:05] <rgr> whats a datarecord? ok... I thoutgh clear in the context. And no serialize isnt what I want since that includes everything and not just inputs
[11:09:27] <rgr> googling I see there are some libraries. Thanks.
[11:09:27] <jquser> ravenzz: but it is much less  pleasure in debugging than smashing it with a hammer
[11:09:48] <ravenzz> I agree :]
[11:10:51] <gloomer> rgr
[11:11:14] <gloomer> $('input textarea').serialzie();
[11:11:50] <tolborg> how would I determine the position of a particular <li> in an <ul> ?
[11:11:59] <tolborg> position in relation to siblings
[11:12:40] <ravenzz> sibling top position - current elem's one?
[11:13:06] <gloomer> rgr $('input:checkbox').serialize()
[11:13:07] <gloomer> something like that
[11:19:03] <arielserafini> gloomer: wouldn't the selector be $("input, textarea") ?
[11:19:06] <systemfault> tolborg: Take a look at .index()
[11:21:38] <LoneStar99> how would i remove text from a input box?
[11:22:21] <Clorith> Look into .val()
[11:23:23] <LoneStar99> yeah  i thinking this should work... $('#location').val('');
[11:27:20] <gloomer> arielserafini $('input[type=textarea], input[type=checkbox]')
[11:27:25] <tolborg> systemfault: thanks!
[11:27:47] <gloomer> now that i played with it
[11:30:25] <arielserafini> gloomer: the guy left anyway

[11:56:50] <silver4e> without remove old state
[11:57:18] <shoky> wat?
[11:57:18] <b-ot> It means that you can devote a your page, to those who do have JS turned on. I.e. only those with JS turned-on to call the function.
[11:57:42] <silver4e> sek

[12:02:00] <shoky> silver4e: in the fiddle, paste the _output_ of your php, not the php itself
[12:02:24] <shoky> (this isn't #php)
[12:03:43] <silver4e> no no i generate html via php but my source is same like you
[12:03:56] <shoky> silver4e if it was same like me then it would work same like me, no?
[12:03:56] <silver4e> the problem is UI somewhere

[12:34:54] <SmokingSlim> good english there smoking
[12:35:07] <versatiletech> works in Chrome 21
[12:35:54] <SmokingSlim> versatiletech yeah but the "previous" button don't loop it back to the last Div, as pressing the "next" does
[12:36:28] <versatiletech> oh ok
[12:36:45] <versatiletech> you said "non-functioning Previous button"
[12:37:07] <SmokingSlim> let me refrase that "Error functioning previous button"
[12:38:36] <SmokingSlim> I've been trying to get help on this fiddle for about 12 hours straight in this channel and no one seems to have a single clue on how to solve this
[12:38:53] <SmokingSlim> where can I find an advance Jquery channel?
[12:39:30] <versatiletech> lol this is the place or hire an expert
[12:40:04] <SmokingSlim> yeah but this is like a basic ultra lightweight beginners function and no one knows how to solve it
[12:40:16] <SmokingSlim> makes me doubt what an "expert" can make out of it
[12:42:55] <arielserafini> SmokingSlim: how many people in here have attempted to solve your problem?
[12:43:21] <arielserafini> i don't get how you can infer that people don't know how to solve it
[12:43:27] <versatiletech> you're expecting too much from IRC, you need to bring your expectations down. It's basically FREE support so you should keep that in mind. You may or may not run into the right person, just keep trying, figure it out yourself, or pay for a pro. Having said that let me have a look.
[12:43:34] <SmokingSlim> arielserafini 'bout 3ppl, the rest of the channel is kindda idle
[12:44:34] <arielserafini> how dare they idle, instead of helping you, on this IRC channel that you pay real money to have access to, right?
[12:45:40] <SmokingSlim> yea you know, im a noob questing for experience and if this is the kind of community you get to i think ill just logg off and hit the books. Thought ppl would be more friendly or at least point in the right direction
[12:46:18] <SmokingSlim> ill hit the documentation. thanks anyways guys
[12:47:23] <arielserafini> SmokingSlim: who is being unfriendly?
[12:47:37] <arielserafini> I'm sorry if i have offended you, I'm not trying to be a jerk
[12:48:14] <arielserafini> but you have to realize that people will help you if they are able to, when they are able to
[12:48:35] <SmokingSlim> im not saying people are hostile but it's not very newbie-friendly enviroment
[12:49:42] <ngharo> SmokingSlim: direction === 'next'; ???
[12:49:49] <ngharo> do you mean direction = 'next';
[12:50:09] <ngharo> http://jsfiddle.net/VdrdY/3/
[12:54:21] <SmokingSlim> ngharo well do you know! You, good sir, have saved my wall from further headbashing and deservse to get a planet named after you! Thank you so much!
[12:56:16] <versatiletech> SmokingSlim: now you see what we mean
[12:59:03] <versatiletech> you can get support many times from very knowledgeable people on IRC, but since it's voluntary and free it's on their schedule. It's a lesson we've all learned and have been able to receive and give help to others. :)
[13:05:59] <xnm> Hey. HOw do I use jQuery's slide effect to hide an element that contains fixed elements within it? The fixed elements refuse to hide.
[13:06:09] <xnm> slide*
[13:08:01] <tolborg_> how do I add two number‚Ä¶ like this 8 + 4 = 84
[13:08:10] <tolborg_> not 8 + 4 = 12
[13:09:42] <ngharo> ?js 8 + '' + 4
[13:09:47] <bot-t> ngharo: "84"
[13:14:09] <radify> tolborg: if you need it back as an int use parseInt();
[13:32:57] <sunbeam> I want to enable datepicker when a certain input field is clicked
[13:32:58] <sunbeam> any idea how i can do this?
[13:35:03] <ThrushAAX> sunbeam: UI datepicker needs to be bound to an input field anyway
[13:35:18] <ThrushAAX> and it automatically shown when that input is clicked
[13:35:28] <ThrushAAX> beyond that you can use .datepicker("show")
[13:36:03] <sunbeam> jQuery(".calendar-form input").datepicker();
[13:36:06] <sunbeam> is this enough?
[13:36:23] <sunbeam> it doesnt work
[13:36:39] <sunbeam> ehh sorry it does
[13:36:41] <sunbeam> but the thing is
[13:36:44] <sunbeam> i got 6 fields
[13:36:48] <sunbeam> for start and end date
[13:36:52] <sunbeam> MM DD YY 2 times
[13:37:12] <sunbeam> i want when i click on the field the date to be put in the MM DD YYYY format in those 3 input fields
[13:37:16] <shoky> change it to 2?
[13:37:41] <shoky> you can do that i think, but it'll be more work..
[13:37:47] <shoky> and for what
[13:38:23] <sunbeam> change it to 2?
[13:38:25] <sunbeam> how u mean
[13:38:29] <shoky> 2 instead of 6..
[13:38:41] <shoky> 2 datepicker fields
[13:38:44] <sunbeam> yea thats a lot easier
[13:38:55] <sunbeam> but thats not how i designed this site i dont feel like changing it for client :(
[13:39:39] <shoky> and you do feel like dealing with getting the date into 3 fields and back?
[13:39:49] <izepstan> hi, hello there, what is an easy way to send one input field in a form instead of all to a url with PHP understanding the $_POST?
[13:40:16] <shoky> sunbeam: anyway.. take a look at the datepicker events/methods. they should be sufficient for what you want
[13:41:26] <shoky> izepstan: $.post('url', $('#myInput').serialize())
[13:43:00] <sunbeam> shoky: and back yes :(
[13:43:14] <sunbeam> well that wont be the hardest hehe
[13:43:17] <izepstan> simple i like it. thx.
[13:43:18] <sunbeam> which method?
[13:43:35] <shoky> sunbeam: i'm not gonna do that ugly work for you sry ;)
[13:43:46] <sunbeam> beforeClick on the calendar or something?
[13:43:55] <shoky> no idea, i dont remember the events/methods by heart
[13:44:11] <sunbeam> can't be anything else :p
[13:44:15] <sunbeam> anyway i search
[13:44:19] <shoky> gl
[13:51:41] <raj> how can I 'easily' keep a socket open and ready to accept json, that is backwards compatible with older browsers up to IE7?
[13:53:24] <raj> shoky my niinja
[13:53:33] <jacta> How do I get top to run in -x instead of just x? http://jsfiddle.net/Jacta/RPFMh/4/
[13:54:23] <jacta> like: top: -10px .... top: -20px
[14:00:18] <sunbeam> shoky: onSelect: function(dateText, inst) { }
[14:00:29] <sunbeam> only return false doesn't work
[14:00:35] <sunbeam> whats better to use in a case like this again?
[14:00:42] <sunbeam> preventdefault or something?
[14:01:11] <shoky> raj bro
[14:03:26] <jacta> Anyone?
[14:04:19] <shoky> sunbeam: there is nothing to prevent there
[14:04:31] <sunbeam> well when i click the date
[14:04:40] <shoky> sunbeam: it's called after the date's already been selected and the input value changed
[14:04:46] <sunbeam> it shoul not put it directly in the input
[14:04:54] <sunbeam> ohh hmm
[14:05:27] <shoky> sunbeam also check out the altField option
[14:05:32] <shoky> might come in handy
[14:06:02] <sunbeam> well whats better to just clear the field it puts data in
[14:06:06] <sunbeam> that would do the same right
[14:06:33] <shoky> yeah but, if you use the altField on some hidden input
[14:06:57] <shoky> then you can use that later instead of building a new date string from the 3 individual fields
[14:07:20] <shoky> i'm just guessing tho
[14:07:30] <sunbeam> ehmm yea maybe that would be better
[14:08:06] <sunbeam> but what i dont get
[14:08:11] <jrockjiggz> jacta: css('top', x+'px')
[14:08:15] <sunbeam> eh sec
[14:08:49] <sunbeam> shoky: but how do I decide in whcih field i put it
[14:09:29] <shoky> sunbeam: the altField ?
[14:13:29] <shoky> sunbeam: you could do smth like: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/ztYAG/3/
[14:13:31] <shoky> no altField
[14:14:00] <jacta> jrockjiggz, can you tell me how to get this to go to zero when x = totalheight? http://jsfiddle.net/Jacta/RPFMh/5/
[14:14:12] <F1skr> anyway to get "this" to refer to the object rather than "Window" in this code? http://jsfiddle.net/fm9kf/4/  $.when.apply( is messing it up as it is now.
[14:16:02] <ajpiano> F1skr: $.when.apply( self, urls ); and also your .helper function needs to reterun $.ajax(){});
[14:16:40] <ajpiano> you need var urls = $.map(self.urls, $.proxy(self.helper, self));
[14:18:05] <tw2113> oh the jquerys
[14:18:16] <F1skr> ajpiano: thank you very much
[14:18:20] <ajpiano> the scope of the when doesn't actually matter, ti's the scope of the hekler and the return
[14:18:24] <ajpiano> F1skr: i think this should work
[14:18:24] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/fm9kf/6/
[14:18:24] <sunbeam> shoky: thanks
[14:18:25] <sunbeam> sec
[14:18:29] <ajpiano> i'm out the door though so go from there
[14:18:39] <F1skr> It did work thanks
[14:18:47] <ajpiano> great!
[14:28:39] <venus_> hello, i am using jquery to add some html before an element, here is the code http://pastebin.com/hzSvF9cW but it is not working i guess
[14:29:40] <tw2113> do you have some dom element with a class of "amount" ?
[14:30:00] <venus_> dom element ?
[14:30:15] <tw2113> a div or something like that :P
[14:30:15] <venus_> yes there is an element with <span class="amount"> in the html
[14:30:20] <venus_> yes there is a div
[14:32:02] <tw2113> hmm
[14:34:32] <tw2113> not sure, it worked for my quick test
[14:34:59] <havvg> hi there, anyone knows how I can restore lost context of a dom node to jquery?
[14:37:50] <venus_> tw can you show a jsfiddle please?
[14:39:07] <tw2113> it worked with my firefox scratchpad at least :D
[14:39:40] <wiherek> hi
[14:39:42] <tw2113> not working for me in jsfiddle without some event trigger
[14:40:00] <tw2113> oops
[14:40:04] <tw2113> forgot to include jquery
[14:40:13] <tw2113> http://jsfiddle.net/qHXpZ/
[14:40:58] <wiherek> I compare a variable to a string and it returns true. How can I compare a variable to any string (element) in an array?
[14:41:56] <wiherek> like... if ($(this) = jQuery.inArray($(this), arr)) { //do something }
[14:42:17] <tw2113> ?each @ wiherek
[14:42:23] <tw2113> bah
[14:42:26] <tw2113> i can't master the bot in here
[14:42:41] <tw2113> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[14:46:36] <venus_> wierd doesnt work :s
[14:46:42] <venus_> http://321.outsourcejobstome.com/ is the page
[14:48:57] <raj> how can I 'easily' keep a socket open and ready to accept json, that is backwards compatible with older browsers up to IE7?
[14:49:20] <tw2113> suddenly seeing $ is not a function venus_
[14:50:15] <mikefrey> have you looked at using socket.io?
[14:50:27] <tw2113> try using jQuery('.amount') venus_
[14:51:27] <venus_> jquery ?
[14:51:37] <tw2113> the word jQuery instead of $
[14:53:35] <tw2113> may need to do it on all 3 venus_
[14:54:00] <tw2113> $(window).load(function(){
[14:54:00] <tw2113> $(document).ready(function(){ <----redundant
[14:56:04] <sunbeam> shoky: Error: TypeError: inst is undefined
[14:56:06] <sunbeam> wth any idea?
[14:56:14] <sunbeam> its in the jquery ui core code
[14:56:15] <sunbeam> the error
[14:57:30] <venus_> tq: wierd it didnt change :s
[14:57:39] <tolborg_> I have a set of elements. How do I find the one(s) with a specific data() value?
[14:58:08] <wiherek> right so now I am using this to compare them, but
[14:58:50] <tw2113> venus_, http://pastebin.com/UAgER88E
[14:58:52] <wiherek> when I do $.each(arr, function() { console.log($(this)) }    the console prints
[14:59:39] <wiherek> String -> 0: "h" 1: "e" 2: "l" ... etc
[14:59:49] <wiherek> the array element is hello
[15:00:24] <venus_> tw: thanks that worked whats the use of jquery instead of $ ?
[15:00:43] <tw2113> jQuery is aliased to $
[15:00:58] <tw2113> and wordpress works in noConflict mode
[15:01:35] <venus_> hmm ok thanks a lot tw
[15:01:38] <tw2113> if you HAD to use the $, you could do jQuery(document).ready(function($){ to pass it in
[15:01:46] <tw2113> then inside that block of code you could use $
[15:02:21] <tw2113> yay! i can say i helped in here
[15:11:19] <wiherek> why doesnt this work
[15:11:20] <wiherek> http://jsfiddle.net/s5WdP/5/
[15:11:21] <wiherek> ?
[15:13:19] <Krambiorix> hi i have a span in a table cell. How can i get the table row 's index?
[15:13:42] <wiherek> this doesnt work either - why? http://jsfiddle.net/s5WdP/6/

[15:19:12] <tw2113> ah i know
[15:19:30] <wiherek> ?
[15:20:10] <tw2113> maybe
[15:21:00] <tw2113> i may be wrong actually :D
[15:24:34] <wilornel> Hey guys, do you know why when I click a 'bringMe' class once, the panning works perfect, but when I click a second time on the same or any other 'bringMe' class, it says : "panTo: latLng must be of type LatLng" in the console?     https://gist.github.com/3589461
[15:26:02] <wilornel> This is what my console looks like: https://gist.github.com/3589550
[15:26:55] <tw2113> wiherek, i got $.each(arr, function(i,val) {
[15:26:55] <tw2113>   $("p").append(val);
[15:26:55] <tw2113> }); to work
[15:27:07] <wiherek> yea :(
[15:27:21] <tw2113> what's wrong with that?
[15:27:39] <kkuno> hi
[15:27:46] <kkuno> I don't know if it is the right channel
[15:27:47] <wiherek> well, I was on that too
[15:28:03] <kkuno> mmh, well it isn't
[15:28:04] <wiherek> it seems that it outputs array elements not as strings but as arrays
[15:28:16] <wiherek> when not pointing to the val
[15:29:00] <wiherek> its not wrong its just overly complex. i wouldnt expect js to act like that
[15:29:26] <wiherek> i defined those array items as strings, right, so why turn them into something else
[15:29:58] <wiherek> and console.log does show that those elements are strings, but it outputs them as arrays anyway. that sucks kind of
[15:30:55] <tw2113> but with 3 more characters, you can have it work the way you want
[15:31:15] <sunbeam> Somehow I cannot get datepicker to display on a type="hidden" field
[15:31:30] <wiherek> tw2113: yea, I know
[15:31:37] <sunbeam> not even when i use .datepicker("show");
[15:31:38] <sunbeam> any ideas?
[15:32:25] <wiherek> tw2113, what I mean is - I don't really feel like defining variable types here. I didnt specify js to output my strings as arrays - so why does it do that?
[15:32:32] <jrockjiggz> sunbeam: check out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1262113/how-to-call-bind-a-jquery-datepicker-to-a-label-or-div-instead-of-an-input-field
[15:32:44] <wilornel> Hey guys, do you know why when I click a 'bringMe' class once, the panning works perfect, but when I click a second time on the same or any other 'bringMe' class, it says : "panTo: latLng must be of type LatLng" in the console?     https://gist.github.com/3589461
[15:32:46] <tw2113> i think it'd be best to check out the docs on $.each()
[15:32:59] <wilornel> this is what my console looks like: https://gist.github.com/3589550
[15:33:10] <wiherek> yea
[15:33:10] <sunbeam> jrockjiggz: thats exactly how i did it
[15:33:28] <sunbeam> but i think there is maybe some prob with the last jquery ui js
[15:33:49] <tw2113> sunbeam, i'm not completely sure why you're trying to attach it to a hidden field
[15:34:16] <sunbeam> because i want to put the selected date in that hidden field
[15:34:41] <tw2113> hmm
[15:34:50] <sunbeam> you maybe know another way ?
[15:34:57] <tw2113> not without research
[15:35:00] <shoky> sunbeam didn't my fiddle do that?
[15:35:05] <sunbeam> shoky: yes it did
[15:35:12] <sunbeam> but there is some error in the jquery ui source code
[15:35:16] <sunbeam> sec i paste bin it
[15:35:21] <shoky> no, fiddle it
[15:35:40] <tw2113> always fiddle with js/jquery
[15:36:11] <sunbeam> ok
[15:36:39] <tw2113> leave pastebins to the php people :P
[15:36:53] <shoky> sunbeam: in my fiddle, inst was an argument to onSelect ..
[15:37:04] <shoky> maybe you forgot to write the argument names?
[15:38:19] <sunbeam> ah i forgot
[15:38:21] <sunbeam> let me retest
[15:38:48] <sunbeam> "position is null "
[15:38:50] <sunbeam> thats what i get now
[15:39:14] <sunbeam> referring to jquery-ui-1.8.23.custom.js
[15:39:17] <sunbeam> line 1706
[15:39:26] <sunbeam> i cannot reproduce this in fiddle
[15:42:35] <raj> how can I 'easily' keep a socket open and ready to accept json, that is backwards compatible with older browsers up to IE7?
[15:43:37] <sunbeam> shoky or tw2113  any ideas
[15:43:49] <tw2113> never used ui before
[15:48:05] <shoky> sunbeam we need a fiddle or a live site or _something_
[15:49:35] <tw2113> honestly not directed at anyone in here, but shoky, are you ever surprised by how many people don't use some sort of js console for debugging or doing anything with js dev these days?
[15:52:53] <sunbeam> shoky: the thing is that when i use input type="text" it works on the object
[15:53:08] <sunbeam> but when i use type="hidden" i get the position error
[15:53:08] <shoky> tw2113: it's both surprising and not ;)
[15:53:17] <sunbeam> maybe because there is already another datepicker inline instance
[15:53:43] <shoky> sunbeam: im not gonna even think about an answer without a fiddle or live demo. i have no idea what you're doing
[15:55:08] <shoky> raj: socket.io no good?
[15:59:16] <tash> I'm having a terrible time with all these quotes :P $('td:eq(0)', nRow).html( "<td class=\"checkbox\"><input type=\"checkbox\" rel=\"test\" /></td>" );  I have a var that I want to use for the rel ... can someone please show me how?
[15:59:48] <tash> var rel = aData[1];  I want to use that "rel" var for my rel in the HTML.
[16:00:02] <theBrettman> i forgot how to use each I guess? $('.entry-content a').attr('href').each(function(i,v){copy(v);}); not working
[16:00:20] <tash> I tried rel=\" " + rel + \" " and other combinations, but I keep getting it wrong.
[16:00:28] <tolborg_> how do I find an element based on a value set by data() ?
[16:00:38] <sunbeam> shoky: i have this only locla
[16:00:41] <sunbeam> ill try to fix it
[16:00:48] <tw2113> .html( '<td class="checkbox"><input type="checkbox" rel=" '+aData[1]+ ' " /></td>' );
[16:00:53] <sunbeam> but what i dont understand, why does using something like
[16:00:56] <sunbeam> altField: "#check_in_date"
[16:00:59] <shoky> tash: .html('<td class="checkbox"><input type="checkbox" rel="' + rel + '"/></td>' )
[16:01:00] <sunbeam> doesnt work
[16:01:20] <theBrettman> ohai, tw2113
[16:01:26] <shoky> sunbeam: stop it with the meaningless questions
[16:01:30] <sunbeam> i mean why does it also put the content in the other input field
[16:02:15] <tw2113> yo
[16:02:36] <tash> thanks guys
[16:02:46] <tash> much easier leading off with the single quote :D
[16:03:05] <shoky> pretty easy without it too ;P
[16:03:20] <tash> can you show me that? I'd like to learn what I was doing wrong.
[16:03:44] <shoky> .html( "<td class=\"checkbox\"><input type=\"checkbox\" rel=\"" + rel + "\" /></td>" )
[16:03:54] <theBrettman> how do I get a collection of links in a container?
[16:04:00] <tash> I swear I tried that
[16:04:02] <tash> trying now.
[16:05:01] <tash> guess now ;)
[16:05:03] <tash> not
[16:05:24] <shoky> theBrettman: $('.entry-content a').each(function() { copy( $(this).attr('href') ) })
[16:05:25] <tash> thanks guys
[16:05:41] <shoky> theBrettman: you can't .attr('href').each(...    because .attr('href') returns a string
[16:06:00] <shoky> namely the first a's href
[16:06:07] <theBrettman> ah, no wonder
[16:06:21] <theBrettman> thx
[16:10:22] <nardev> hello, i want to be able to add "confirm" id to a link, so that i can choose certain links to have "alert/dialog" confirm if they are clicked.. and depending on action, to procede on certain url or to be stopped. here is what i have, the problem is if i have different actions, how can i tell to this "universal" selector to distinguish calls? http://pastebin.com/vvX0eTXq
[16:10:48] <theBrettman> is there anything in jquery to get a url parameter?
[16:11:03] <shoky> nardev: use a class, not an id for those links
[16:11:06] <nardev> theBrettman, i'll add that
[16:11:26] <jrockjiggz> theBrettman, : http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_decodeURIComponent.asp
[16:11:38] <nardev> ok shoky, i thought there is no problem if i use id instead
[16:11:47] <shoky> nardev: ids need to be unique
[16:12:07] <nardev> shoky, ou, ok.. thnx big mistake than
[16:12:09] <jrockjiggz> theBrettman, : sorry thats not what you asked
[16:12:41] <shoky> nardev: and you can get info about the actual link thats clicked just like you did with $(this).attr('title')
[16:12:45] <theBrettman> nope, I just want to get a url parameter from a string
[16:13:12] <theBrettman> not doing anything with click
[16:13:24] <theBrettman> this is a batch script I'm injecting into a page
[16:13:38] <nardev> shoky, would that make javascript be able to distinguish calls when i call >  $(this).someMethod
[16:13:55] <shoky> nardev: yeah, inside the click handler, 'this' is the element that was clicked
[16:13:56] <theBrettman> for some reason, the copy() function isn't doing what it's supposed to either, lol
[16:13:57] <nardev> shoky, i know that but first obstacle was to distinguish calls
[16:14:12] <nardev> shoky, yes, that is what i wanted
[16:14:23] <nardev> shoky, thank you
[16:14:27] <nardev> let me try
[16:15:15] <theBrettman> but that's a problem with jdownloader. it's supposed to pick up ever copy to the clipboard. it totally ignores it when I use that script
[16:16:12] <tash> http://pastie.org/4648144 <----- if finished isn't null I want to add checked="checked" and disabled="disabled" in that .html().  I must be doing my check wrong.  How do you check if something is null?
[16:16:39] <shoky> tash: == null
[16:16:46] <tash> that easy huh?
[16:16:50] <tash> I tried length
[16:17:00] <shoky> or, === null  if you want to distinguish it from 0,false,undefined etc
[16:18:19] <shoky> tash: btw you're inserting a <td> into a <td>
[16:18:40] <nardev> shoky, :( nah, using .class instead of #id didn't distinguish the calls, if i click selected element, and when it creates a dialogue, and when i click with another selected element, id doesn't recreate it with different title :(
[16:18:40] <tash> good point
[16:18:48] <tash> http://pastie.org/4648158 shoky?
[16:19:04] <shoky> uhh no good ;)
[16:19:22] <shoky> wait
[16:19:23] <shoky> echo?
[16:19:29] <tash> wait
[16:19:31] <tash> bad paste
[16:19:52] <tash> n/m, thought I sent something else
[16:20:07] <tash> carried php into this, oops
[16:20:08] <tash> hmm,
[16:20:27] <tash> I don't want to echo it, obviously
[16:20:34] <ogk1000> for fillStyle how can I use an image on this simple snippiet ? http://pastebin.com/JTLuSWhV
[16:20:40] <tash> I want to put it in the .html with the rest of the stuff
[16:21:14] <shoky> nardev: you're creating a new <div> on each click that has id='confirm-dialog'
[16:21:34] <nardev> shoky, i added     $( "#confirm-dialog:ui-dialog" ).dialog( "destroy" );
[16:22:17] <shoky> nardev: you're still creating a new div on each click that has id='confirm-dialog'
[16:22:22] <nardev> shoky, but it didn't help much :) .. i think that if i add action to destroy dialog on escape/close that it will be ok
[16:22:29] <nardev> shoky, yes
[16:22:33] <nardev> i need it :(
[16:22:37] <shoky> no you don't
[16:22:41] <shoky> you only need one
[16:22:50] <shoky> and you can change its title instead of creating a new one
[16:22:58] <nardev> shoky, how can i pass title and value to dialog :( can't find that example
[16:22:59] <shoky> and just call .dialog('show')
[16:23:10] <shoky> (after you've initialized it once with .dialog(options) )
[16:23:46] <nardev> shoky, hm, so you are suggesting me to always have created div on every page, which would be used when i need it?
[16:23:47] <shoky> nardev: you can .attr('title', 'new title')  i think..
[16:24:23] <shoky> nardev: yeah that's a good simple way to do it. you could of course only create/initialize it lazily when you first need it
[16:24:31] <nardev> shoky, dynamically creating it is not so good solution?
[16:24:39] <shoky> nardev: it's fine. but not on EACH click
[16:24:45] <shoky> just once..
[16:24:50] <nardev> shoky, oki
[16:24:52] <shoky> or if you really want to re-create it
[16:24:56] <shoky> then .remove() the old one first
[16:25:04] <shoky> (and also 'destroy' it)
[16:25:05] <nardev> shoky, ok thnx
[16:25:37] <nardev> i think that i'll go with that one, check if it exists and remove it... since this is big JS file and BIG page
[16:25:48] <nardev> so.... i think that would be easier...
[16:25:56] <shoky> as u wish
[16:25:58] <nardev> to track what is going on
[16:26:04] <nardev> shoky, thank you anyway
[16:26:08] <shoky> np
[16:31:51] <shoky> nardev: ah to change the title you can .dialog('option', 'title', 'new titleee')
[16:32:13] <nardev> shoky, thnak you
[16:32:30] <nardev> :)
[16:34:29] <theBrettman> is jsfiddle gone?
[16:34:43] <theBrettman> I had a lot of code on there I didn't wanna lose
[16:37:36] <tw2113> are you sure you're going to jsfidde.net ?
[16:38:51] <theBrettman> ohhhh
[16:38:58] <theBrettman> whew! that was a relief!
[16:39:05] <tw2113> were you .com'ing?
[16:39:22] <theBrettman> yep, all over the place, what a mess, lol
[16:40:01] <theBrettman> ahhh, my precious fiddles!
[16:44:04] <defaultro> hey folks, I need your help. I'm unable to pull the value from name="dir". Code is http://jsfiddle.net/3aFpv
[16:44:29] <defaultro> my teammate wrote it
[16:46:03] <defaultro> other textboxes are fine though but I didn't include it anymore. The only one I am having problems with is this formdata.dir
[16:47:22] <defaultro> do we use val() for select?
[16:48:12] <defaultro> the other day, I learned that we should use .text() when retrieving from text not on textboxes
[16:48:55] <sparuvu1> defaultro: text is used to retrieve the  innerText of the element
[16:49:07] <sparuvu1> while val is used to retrieve the value of the element
[16:49:21] <defaultro> what about for the select?
[16:49:31] <sparuvu1> for textArea and input type text ‚Ä¶ whatever you see is actually the value
[16:49:39] <sparuvu1> but not the innerText
[16:50:11] <versatiletech> defaultro: I think it's $('select option:selected').val()
[16:50:32] <defaultro> which is not in the current code right?
[16:50:48] <defaultro> oh, it's at the bottom'
[16:51:43] <defaultro> so looking at it, it;s returning an array using the names as the index
[16:51:59] <versatiletech> defaultro: http://jsfiddle.net/3aFpv/1/
[16:52:03] <defaultro> k
[16:52:35] <defaultro> sweet, i'll try now
[16:52:37] <defaultro> ;)
[16:52:38] <versatiletech> actually http://jsfiddle.net/3aFpv/2/
[16:52:40] <sparuvu1> defaultro: http://jsfiddle.net/ubgCf/1/
[16:52:43] <defaultro> oh
[16:52:45] <versatiletech> I'm assuming
[16:53:32] <defaultro> that's a very good example sparuvu1
[16:54:02] <defaultro> the text will be useless then for me. It's val that's i need
[16:54:09] <sparuvu1> I m glad that it helped you ‚Ä¶.
[16:54:53] <defaultro> yes, very good example!
[16:55:00] <defaultro> simple and it rocks
[16:55:09] <defaultro> thanks too versatiletech, I'll use your changes now
[16:57:38] <theBrettman> ok, I guess window.location.search.substring(1); can get the url parameters from the location bar but how would I do it from a string?
[17:02:52] <sunbeam> any way how i can check if $(this) has a certain class?
[17:02:54] <sunbeam> if($this). has class xxxx
[17:02:56] <sunbeam> then ..
[17:02:58] <sunbeam> else ..
[17:03:09] <tw2113> .hasClass('foo') ?
[17:03:13] <versatiletech> .is('.class')
[17:04:07] <versatiletech> theBrettman: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_split.asp
[17:04:57] <sunbeam> tw2113: if(($this).hasClass('foo'))
[17:05:00] <sunbeam> is that good?
[17:05:06] <tw2113> try it and see
[17:05:09] <martisj> morning
[17:05:33] <tw2113> i think you have your brackets mixed a bit
[17:05:43] <tw2113> if($(this).hasClass('foo'));
[17:06:45] <sunbeam> ok
[17:09:01] <raj> shoky, it's mad confusing
[17:11:05] <jamesaa> data_id is a variable how do I do this is what I have $('a[data-id="data_id"]')
[17:14:37] <tw2113> $('a[data-id="'+data_id+'"]')
[17:14:49] <jamesaa> tw2113, oh thanks
[17:19:18] <jamesaa> tw2113, can I replace a with div which surrounds the a will it still work?
[17:19:56] <tw2113> as long as the data-id attribute is still on it, i don't see why it wouldn't
[17:20:06] <tw2113> $('div[data-id="'+data_id+'"]')
[17:27:28] <sunbeam> say i have 2 vars, one with 09/01/2012 the other with 09/10/2012
[17:28:22] <sunbeam> and i want to get all dates in between (includingt those 2 dates) in a string
[17:32:07] <Raydiation> could it be that val() only reads out the first value of an input field?
[17:32:20] <Raydiation> if i change it with js it returns the first value
[17:32:27] <Raydiation> despite having a different one
[17:35:00] <Raydiation> got it
[17:35:08] <Raydiation> two fields with the same id -.-
[17:53:04] <defaultro> versatiletech, just got back. A visitor came. It's still not working
[17:54:34] <versatiletech> defaultro: could you show a working version of the code along with HTML. It's more difficult to deduce things from just partial javascript.
[17:54:57] <defaultro> it's an intranet application
[17:55:08] <defaultro> I'm not sure how to show a link
[17:55:21] <defaultro> i'll firebug that code right now. One sec
[17:58:07] <versatiletech> theBrettman: something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/cq2gd/
[18:18:56] <raj> shoky, you there?
[18:19:50] <defaultro> versatiletech, $this right now in Firebug contains the one I selected
[18:20:15] <defaultro> inside $this when I expand it, I see value="T"
[18:20:20] <defaultro> that's what I need
[18:20:36] <versatiletech> you mean this or $(this)?
[18:20:49] <defaultro> currently, we wrote $(this).find('option:selected').val()
[18:21:23] <versatiletech> is this pointing to the select?
[18:21:31] <versatiletech> "this"
[18:21:43] <defaultro> yes
[18:21:45] <defaultro> one sec
[18:22:52] <defaultro> ok, it pulled the right value
[18:23:09] <defaultro> doing the next loop hoping it would not overwrite it
[18:23:19] <versatiletech> shouldn't
[18:24:27] <defaultro> yup, it is still looking good
[18:24:38] <defaultro> i'm troubleshooting now why it is not saving the new value
[18:24:47] <defaultro> once I exit out that function, we will find out
[18:24:49] <defaultro> one sec
[18:25:03] <defaultro> omg, the value changed!
[18:25:27] <defaultro> it found another name="dir"
[18:25:30] <defaultro> that is so weird
[18:26:32] <defaultro> now i have to figure out why it's finding another name="dir"
[18:28:16] <defaultro> i'm now displaying the generated html source
[18:28:38] <defaultro> wow, there are different name="dir" :(
[18:29:01] <defaultro> that is the culprit :(
[18:29:16] <versatiletech> ha!
[18:29:41] <defaultro> or maybe, we can be more detailed in referencing to the class
[18:31:04] <defaultro> i'm going to open our api to see if attributes.dir is specific for direction
[18:41:46] <wilornel> Hey guys, do you know why when I click a 'bringMe' class once, the panning works perfect, but when I click a second time on the same or any other 'bringMe' class, it says : "panTo: latLng must be of type LatLng" in the console?     https://gist.github.com/3589461
[18:42:02] <wilornel> This is what my console looks like: https://gist.github.com/3589550
[18:44:09] <defaultro> versatiletech, our data mapping tells name="dir" that we only require the one for "travel of direction"
[18:44:46] <versatiletech> defaultro: I need more context. I don't know what you're talking about.
[18:45:31] <defaultro> there are some values that gets added to the form eventhough they're not displayed
[18:45:41] <defaultro> i'm going to post the fieldsets
[18:50:23] <defaultro> versatiletech, http://jsfiddle.net/3aFpv/4/
[18:51:03] <defaultro> that's the html generated source
[18:52:17] <defaultro> i don't even see the Jersay on the form from any select dropdown
[18:56:18] <versatiletech> defaultro: what's the problem again?
[18:56:49] <defaultro> it's finding the dir which is good but
[18:57:07] <defaultro> since it's find other dir, it overrides the dir I really need
[18:57:35] <defaultro> i was thinking of coding it this way
[18:57:46] <versatiletech> oh I see
[18:57:56] <versatiletech> can you change the HTML?
[18:58:08] <defaultro> no
[18:58:18] <versatiletech> can you change the javascript?
[18:58:27] <defaultro> it's coming from the main source which will affect the other team's work
[18:58:30] <defaultro> yes
[18:58:51] <defaultro> i just need to ignore the other dir
[18:59:04] <defaultro> other selects from the same form still need to continue
[18:59:08] <defaultro> still need to work
[18:59:33] <versatiletech> yes, you'll need to differentiate the element with name="dir"
[18:59:48] <defaultro> how do we pull the value of class? for example, class="wdtd50 hidden editfields"
[19:00:02] <versatiletech> $().attr('class')
[19:00:10] <defaultro> got it
[19:00:35] <defaultro> if $(this).attr('class') === wdtd50 hidden editfields { grab the dir}
[19:00:43] <defaultro> that's what I was thinking
[19:01:03] <defaultro> if ($(this).attr('class') === "wdtd50 hidden editfields") { grab the dir}
[19:01:20] <defaultro> will that work?
[19:02:42] <versatiletech> you could do if( $(this).is('.wdtd50') ) {}
[19:02:51] <defaultro> k
[19:03:35] <versatiletech> or this $(this).hasClass('wdtd50'), but .is() is more flexible if you need to look for a different selector
[19:03:46] <defaultro> cool
[19:04:50] <defaultro> I'm writing it now, I'll post to jsfiddle once it's complete
[19:06:14] <defaultro> and is && right?
[19:06:21] <defaultro> if (cond1 && cond2)
[19:06:49] <defaultro> yup, it is :)
[19:10:12] <defaultro> what do you think about this, http://jsfiddle.net/u3Qvz
[19:11:32] <defaultro> the second data[] should be on the outside if
[19:12:57] <versatiletech> you're going to get the same results because you're not doing anything different in the if...else
[19:13:10] <defaultro> i did some changes now, let me double check first
[19:14:10] <versatiletech> do you care about the value of the first select with name="dir"?
[19:14:17] <defaultro> no
[19:14:21] <defaultro> i made changes now
[19:14:27] <defaultro> http://jsfiddle.net/u3Qvz/1
[19:14:58] <versatiletech> then use "continue" instead of data[$(this).attr("name")] = $(this).find('option:selected').val();
[19:15:00] <defaultro> oh wait, it's going to fail other fields because I am using option:selected
[19:15:30] <defaultro> i guess i should return the second data[] to $(this).val();
[19:15:50] <defaultro> what do you think? you can modify my code
[19:15:59] <defaultro> http://jsfiddle.net/u3Qvz/2/
[19:16:03] <defaultro> check that out
[19:16:31] <versatiletech> actually your new code looks about right
[19:16:36] <defaultro> cool
[19:16:37] <versatiletech> have you tested it?
[19:16:40] <defaultro> not yet
[19:16:48] <defaultro> i will add the new code now
[19:16:52] <defaultro> hopefully it works :)
[19:16:54] <defaultro> one sec
[19:19:07] <defaultro> sweet!!!! It worked!!!!
[19:19:22] <defaultro> yehey!!!!
[19:19:33] <defaultro> that .is('.wdt50') is the magic
[19:19:35] <defaultro> :D
[19:19:43] <versatiletech> :)
[19:19:49] <defaultro> looks like I am really learning javascript now
[19:20:09] <defaultro> thanks a lot!
[19:20:18] <versatiletech> hehe
[19:20:22] <defaultro> curious though about your other suggestion which is continue. How does it work?
[19:21:21] <versatiletech> let me check if that'll work. Normally in a loop if you want to discard to "skip" and go to the next element you use "continue;"
[19:21:30] <defaultro> got it
[19:23:18] <versatiletech> ok in .each() it's return true and perhaps even return
[19:23:23] <defaultro> k
[19:23:37] <versatiletech> in a native javascript loop it's continue;
[19:23:51] <versatiletech> each() is a function so it behave's a little different
[19:23:54] <defaultro> ah
[19:24:58] <versatiletech> in each(), return false; stops the looping immediately just as break; would in a loop
[19:26:08] <defaultro> ok
[19:32:29] <xp_prg> can someone help me to understand jsonp?
[19:32:33] <xp_prg> I am quite confused about it
[19:33:08] <xp_prg> I know it can be used for cross domain invocation right?
[19:33:15] <xp_prg> does it require going to the server first to do this?
[19:33:20] <xp_prg> or does it occur all in the browser?
[19:41:11] <shoky> xp_prg: it requires the server to support JSONP
[19:41:28] <j_ayen_green> Having a problem getting .blur to work. Using 1.4.3.  Small function pasted http://pastebin.com/UssYzBF6
[19:41:34] <xp_prg> which server, the one that is being called or the page that loaded the jquery js that calls the jsonp or both?
[19:42:02] <j_ayen_green> The first console.log fires, but not the blur console.log
[19:42:35] <shoky> xp_prg: the one that is being called
[19:43:02] <xp_prg> so what your telling me is that the server that loads the js is never even involved once the js is loaded into the browser right?
[19:43:15] <versatiletech> j_ayen_green: first thing test if the latest version of jquery changes the behavior
[19:43:50] <j_ayen_green> versatiletech: can't really do that. I'm doing this in Drupal, and you can't just load a newer version into it :(
[19:43:57] <shoky> xp_prg: correct
[19:44:10] <tash> shoky: regarding this from earlier, http://pastie.org/4648158, I just sat back down ... I don't know what to do honestly.  probably straight forward.
[19:44:17] * xp_prg hugs shoky very tightly and stares into his eyes
[19:44:24] <versatiletech> j_ayen_green: is the issue in the admin or on the front-end?
[19:45:07] <j_ayen_green> versatiletech: the issue of the blur not firing? console in both chrome and firebug
[19:45:32] <tash> xp_prg: that scares me
[19:45:35] <versatiletech> but are working on something that's in the admin or in the front-end?
[19:45:36] <tash> :P
[19:45:48] <versatiletech> drupal admin
[19:45:59] <j_ayen_green> versatiletech: this is the front end... a form element
[19:46:02] <versatiletech> or front-end (public-facing site)
[19:46:03] <versatiletech> ok
[19:46:21] <versatiletech> you can replace the core version of jquery
[19:46:25] <versatiletech> http://drupal.org/node/217387
[19:46:57] <versatiletech> drupal 6 or 7?
[19:47:27] <shoky> tash: first of all, that  if (finished === null) ...
[19:48:10] <shoky> tash: you put that inside a string... no good. 2nd, you have 'echo' there which makes me think its php..
[19:50:30] <j_ayen_green> versatiletech: it's 7 .. that was for 6, but I found something similar for 7 which 'claims' that even 1.8 can be used. I'll give it a try. Historically it's resulted in problems with Drupal core 'hardwiring' jquery versions, but supposedly 7 fixes that

[19:50:41] <shoky> that's one way..
[19:51:55] <versatiletech> j_ayen_green: you could check if the user is NOT in the admin. This should work fine if you aren't using other modules that are depending on some old parts of jquery 1.4.3.
[19:52:32] <j_ayen_green> versatiletech: one never knows ;)
[19:52:54] <versatiletech> unless you test ;)
[19:55:02] <j_ayen_green> versatiletech: oh, plenty of that!  thanks for the help

[20:21:18] <rgr> whats the standard idiom to convert a form into an object? serializeArray returns an array of the form {{f1:v1}{f2:v2} etc. What I want is an object wher obj.f1=v1 etc. I realise I can loop and make it myself but is there some form of auto convert?

[20:23:46] <wilornel> Hey guys, do you know why when I click a 'bringMe' class once, the panning works perfect, but when I click a second time on the same or any other 'bringMe' class, it says : "panTo: latLng must be of type LatLng" in the console?     https://gist.github.com/3589461
[20:24:01] <wilornel> This is what my console looks like: https://gist.github.com/3589550
[21:02:58] <wilornel> Is anyone here??
[21:09:32] <defaultro> hey guys, i need to check the value if it  matches string access. For example, accessRoad, accessBus. They are coming from <input id="accessBus" ......>
[21:13:59] <defaultro> i
[21:14:06] <defaultro> i'll use .match()
[22:07:51] <top> I have a div - the element itself, and not it's id/class. I want to call jquery find on this div. What would the syntax be?
[22:10:41] <wilornel> top: the div does not have an id or class?
[22:10:46] <wilornel> does he have a name?
[22:11:26] <top> wilornel: i'll have to get it's class/name. is that necessary to run the find method on it?
[22:11:56] <wilornel> well.. you can find him using its class/name/id, but you can also use children() or parent()
[22:12:31] <wilornel> Do you have an example?
[22:12:42] <top> wilornel: I already have the div stored in a js variable. Now, I want to do something like varname.find("a")
[22:13:44] <wilornel> var a = $('#div');
[22:13:53] <wilornel> someClass = a.attr('class');
[22:13:58] <wilornel> there you go, you have the class
