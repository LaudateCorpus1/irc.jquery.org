[00:22:57] <Rockwood> lol
[00:23:10] <Rockwood> finally got few
[00:23:15] <Rockwood> bbl
[01:25:12] <Jasein> can someone explain how I can keep an element as rendered but remove all of it's css styling without removing the classes? Is this possible?
[01:27:04] <robertmaxrees> "keep an element as rendered" -> "remove all of it's css styling"
[01:27:26] <robertmaxrees> Jasein mind explaining what you're actually trying to do?
[01:27:45] <Jasein> basically, I want to resize an element based on an arbitrary reference point that I define in the element. so if I want it 200% size, and aligned bottom right, it will expand ffrom the bottom right.
[01:28:26] <robertmaxrees> why does that require that you remove all of it's styling??
[01:28:40] <Jasein> but if I have a css rule that defines that the object is set bottom:100px, and I resize the element, it keeps that rule.
[01:29:19] <robertmaxrees> then you need to modify that css property, too.
[01:31:12] <Jasein> so .css method will override the class methods? gret!
[01:31:24] <robertmaxrees> erm, wrong terminology but proper idea :)
[01:32:01] <robertmaxrees> the .css() method will generally override any css.
[01:32:39] <robertmaxrees> *any css applied via stylesheets/anything in style tags.
[01:32:58] <Jasein> When I do this by applying bottom:undefined and right:undefined in .animate, it still keeps the bottom:100px reference I assigned earlier...
[01:33:08] <Jasein> https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/LYVQXWY?editors=1111
[01:33:21] <robertmaxrees> "undefined" isn't a thing in css.
[01:33:39] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/bottom
[01:33:39] <Jasein> oh. how do I undefine it then, lol?
[01:33:48] <robertmaxrees> check out "syntax" in that link
[01:35:46] <Jasein> I tried "unset" but didn't work. I'll try all of the others.
[01:36:20] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to animate the square from the middile?
[01:36:37] <robertmaxrees> so it expands up, right, down, and left?
[01:37:31] <Jasein> Eventually , I will be able to animate the size of the square from any reference point. So middle would be one reference point, for example
[01:38:27] <robertmaxrees> then you need to animate the bottom property, as well.
[01:39:06] <Jasein> Okay, but why is that? If I change the width on an element, why would I also need to change the bottom property?
[01:39:25] <robertmaxrees> for exactly the problem you're having now :)
[01:39:38] <robertmaxrees> notice how it's expanding up and right?
[01:42:39] <Jasein> Yes. I had forgotten to calculate the top and left position like I had planned. It gets tricky to figure out the new top and left when expanding from an arbitraty point. thanks for the help and the link.
[01:42:50] <robertmaxrees> def.
[03:56:11] <Rockwood> hi
[03:56:23] <Rockwood> Robdgreat, are you there too?
[03:56:33] <Rockwood> robertparkerx, there?
[04:01:13] <Rockwood> lol
[04:01:19] <Rockwood> i am bit late
[04:01:30] <Rockwood> Cork, hi
[04:41:02] <Rockwood> any active?
[04:41:27] <Cork> Rockwood: if you want help ask your questions not for someone, as it tends to mean you get no help
[04:42:39] <Cork> as if you ask for someone, that said someone has to: 1. ask for your question, 2. wait for the response, 3. then look at if they can actually help you, 4. then construct a followup question or an answer
[04:43:11] <Cork> while if you just ask they can from a glance see if they can answer or if it will be to long for them and give the response
[04:46:35] <Rockwood> Cork, actually i am using ajax and i wanna change input box styling
[04:47:04] <Cork> ok? what does ajax have to do with input styling?
[04:47:06] <Rockwood> one success it will is.valid class
[04:47:29] <Rockwood> and on fail it will do is.invalid class
[04:47:37] <Rockwood> now the issue is
[04:47:58] <Rockwood> once a placed a class on input
[04:48:09] <Rockwood> its not changing
[04:48:31] <Cork> how do you set the classes?
[04:48:49] <Rockwood> $this.addClass('is-valid');  by this
[04:49:31] <Rockwood> its should be change a per response type on every event
[04:50:11] <Cork> and ok so you run .addClass() on an input and it only works the first time?
[04:50:13] <Rockwood> success case this.addClass('is-valid'); and fail case  $this.addClass('is-invalid');
[04:50:32] <Rockwood> Cork, yes your guess is right
[04:50:53] <Cork> have you checked what exactly is in the class="" attribute the second time you've called it?
[04:51:08] <Rockwood> sure
[04:51:13] <Rockwood> chking
[04:52:02] <Cork> i suspect what your problem is, is that your adding both classes
[04:52:14] <Cork> and one takes priority over the other
[04:53:01] <Rockwood> <input type="email" name="email" class="form-control border-0 email is-valid is-invalid" data-url="http://criminalimpulse.com/checkemail" placeholder="Email" aria-label="email" aria-describedby="basic-addon1"
[04:53:10] <Cork> exactly
[04:53:50] <Rockwood> so now
[04:55:54] <Rockwood> means i ve to remove first one before adding new one
[04:57:18] <Cork> Rockwood: simplest is prob to just list all dynamic classes in a .removeClass()
[04:57:32] <Cork> and then just .addClass() the relevant for the current state
[04:58:05] <Rockwood> Cork, i am confuse how is it doable
[04:58:21] <Cork> Rockwood: cause you most likely run the validation twice
[04:58:27] <Cork> once it is invalid and once it is valid
[04:58:35] <Cork> the element is the same so it keeps the classes
[04:58:35] <Rockwood> ternary is the good way to do that?
[04:58:51] <Cork> .removeClass('is-valid is-invalid')
[04:59:04] <Cork> then just add the current class
[04:59:20] <Rockwood> suppose if no class there then
[04:59:41] <Cork> or even better: .addClass('validated').toggleClass('invalid', true/false)
[04:59:50] <Cork> then you don't have to shuffle classes
[05:00:05] <Cork> if it is validated but not invalid it is valid
[05:00:09] <Rockwood> i ve only two classes in this case
[05:00:14] <Cork> but if it is validated AND invalid it is well invalid
[05:00:28] <Cork> ya, but you could make it so they coexist instead of replaces eachother
[05:00:59] <Rockwood> and if you dont mind can you create a example in jsfiddle
[05:01:08] <Cork> .validated {} /* the field is validated and valid */ .validated.invalid {} /* validated but errors found so it is invalid */
[05:01:32] <Cork> don't really see the point of creating a jsfiddle it is just two css classes
[05:01:41] <Rockwood> Cork, i am using bootstrap
[05:01:58] <Rockwood> so the classes coming from BS
[05:02:02] <Cork> well if you are limited to how they create there classes you have to go the more combersome route
[05:02:42] <Cork> as you can't do that with is-valid is-invalid
[05:02:59] <Rockwood> k
[05:03:21] <Cork> (as it is contradictory classes instead of co-existing classes)
[05:06:05] <Rockwood> Cork, thanks works
[05:06:44] <Rockwood>  $this.removeClass('is-valid is-invalid').addClass('is-valid');     $this.removeClass('is-valid is-invalid').addClass('is-invalid');
[05:07:15] <Cork> would prob put the .removeClass in one shared place and then run addClass where it is needed
[05:07:42] <Cork> else it becomes easy to add a new class to one place and miss to remove it in one of the duplicated places
[05:08:54] <Rockwood> k
[17:04:18] <sad431ddd> Hello All, I am have to div next to each other, one of them is large other one small, I want to set top position of the left div, until end of the ride div and stop, and when moves up I want to do the same thing. I am using jquery
[17:04:33] <sad431ddd>    $(document).ready(function() {       $(document).scroll(function() {           if($('#social-float').offset().top + $('#social-float').height() <= $('#help-other-section').offset().top - 10) {               $('#social-float').css('position','relative');               console.log($('#suggestion-list-box').offset().top,
[17:04:34] <sad431ddd> $('#social-float').offset().top + $('#social-float').height(),  $('#help-other-section').offset().top, $('#social-float').offset().top + $('#social-float').height() <= $('#help-other-section').offset().top - 10);                              $('#social-float').css('top', $('#suggestion-list-box').offset().top + 20);            }         });   });
[17:06:52] <robertmaxrees> sad431ddd :(
[17:07:01] <robertmaxrees> don't paste code in the channel - use jsfiddle.
[17:07:22] <sad431ddd> trying too slow :(
[17:07:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:07:33] <sad431ddd> suggestion-list-box
[17:07:44] <sad431ddd> fiddle.jshell.net took too long to respond.
[17:07:56] <sad431ddd> keep crashing on me
[17:08:06] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:08:11] <robertmaxrees> because you wnat https://jsfiddle.net/ :)
[17:08:33] <sad431ddd> this is url from when when try to :)  click save
[17:08:51] <robertmaxrees> it stays on jsfiddle.net for me.
[17:09:05] <robertmaxrees> either way, try another paste service.
[17:09:06] <sad431ddd> https://jsfiddle.net/x85cep74/
[17:09:19] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[17:10:04] <robertmaxrees> so... what's the problem??
[17:11:02] <sad431ddd> actually this one -> https://jsfiddle.net/gow0ejq3/
[17:11:20] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:11:32] <robertmaxrees> so you want the left widget to follow the window as your scroll?
[17:11:33] <robertmaxrees> *you
[17:11:39] <sad431ddd> so I want to box on left follow box on the right until end of the right one
[17:11:44] <sad431ddd> until next row and stop
[17:11:56] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:12:27] <sad431ddd> right now with this code, it will jump onto the end of the page and be stuck there
[17:12:44] <robertmaxrees> it's not working for me at all in the fiddle :/
[17:12:56] <robertmaxrees> though it does jump down a little pbit.
[17:13:27] <robertmaxrees> so your first issue: see how you're doing $('#social-float').css('top', $('#suggestion-list-box').offset().top + 20); ?
[17:14:08] <robertmaxrees> do you see what's wrong with that?
[17:14:21] <sad431ddd> to be honest , not sure
[17:15:02] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vna58uo4/3/
[17:15:26] <robertmaxrees> the offset for #suggestion-list-box never changes.
[17:15:53] <sad431ddd> how will I know where is on the page I am now for that div
[17:15:58] <robertmaxrees> erm/
[17:16:10] <robertmaxrees> you're using that reference point for the wrong thing.
[17:16:10] <sad431ddd> like I am x off from the top
[17:16:25] <robertmaxrees> $('#social-float').css('top', $('#suggestion-list-box').offset().top + 20); is wrong - you want to position compared to the window :)
[17:17:11] <sad431ddd> thanks let me try
[17:17:34] <robertmaxrees> or, even better, just set it to position: fixed; when the user hits a particular point.
[17:17:41] <robertmaxrees> that way you aren't doing all these calculations.
[17:18:08] <sad431ddd> if I do fix, the right column will come on top of the right one
[17:18:19] <sad431ddd> left one
[17:18:26] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to do more refactoring for that to work.
[17:18:36] <robertmaxrees> i literally JUST did this for a project :)
[17:19:34] <sad431ddd> nice, what did you do to make fix work for two column in responsive page
[17:21:16] <robertmaxrees> something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vna58uo4/
[17:21:29] <robertmaxrees> not familiar with your UI library so you'd want to mess around, but that's the basic idea.
[17:21:43] <sad431ddd> thanks let me check
[17:21:49] <robertmaxrees> there's some doing around with adding/removing position relative and fixed and whatnot.
[17:21:56] <robertmaxrees> *screwing around
