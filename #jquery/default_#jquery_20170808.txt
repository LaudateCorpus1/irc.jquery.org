[06:37:29] <galgamach> Hi all. I have a small question:  I have an input type="hidden" inside my form. And I want to check it's value is null or not. If it's not null I want the form not to validate. So I'm using the following code: https://pastebin.com/LdzyCgqh  Is this the correct approach ?

[08:54:28] <DreamStiffler> hi guys
[08:54:34] <DreamStiffler> im back with new question
[08:55:23] <DreamStiffler> two question at : https://jsfiddle.net/3515mgp7/1/
[08:55:58] <DreamStiffler> first question : why am i getting error when i want to select tr:nth-child(2) here
[08:56:19] <DreamStiffler> check function #chk2
[08:58:04] <DreamStiffler> Cork: -Fu
[08:58:17] <DreamStiffler> i meant something like Si Fu
[09:01:15] <DreamStiffler> second question would be like : is there a shorter way to do functions for each check box
[09:08:43] <DreamStiffler> solved q1
[09:08:47] <DreamStiffler> now i need q2
[09:08:53] <DreamStiffler> how do i simplify this code
[09:08:56] <DreamStiffler> script
[09:19:11] <AdamPDotty> just minor things, I would say
[09:21:28] <AdamPDotty> .change(f(){}) -> .on('change', f(){})
[09:21:53] <AdamPDotty> You could even atatch the event to a surrounding fieldset, then you need less event handlers.
[09:22:25] <AdamPDotty> In most cases I would avoid .css()
[09:22:34] <AdamPDotty> better to add and remove classes
[09:23:45] <AdamPDotty> $('tr th') -> $('tr').find('th') or just $('th')
[09:24:47] <AdamPDotty> Your selector looks easy enough, but I would put the result in a variable anway.
[09:24:48] <AdamPDotty> y
[09:27:20] <DreamStiffler> u toking to me AdamPDotty , right
[09:27:34] <ksm101> not perfect and clean, but something like this can do the trick too : https://jsfiddle.net/3515mgp7/6/
[09:28:10] <AdamPDotty> $('#table tr:nth-child(2)') should become $('#table').find('tr').eq(1)
[09:28:21] <AdamPDotty> not a lot difference but cleaner to me
[09:28:58] <DreamStiffler> ksm101: will look and try understand.
[09:29:09] <DreamStiffler> AdamPDotty: thanks too
[09:29:11] * AdamPDotty looks at improved version
[09:31:30] <DreamStiffler> ksm101: err why checking and unchecking does nothing on my side?
[09:32:12] <ksm101> Uh.. well, it works here :/
[09:32:28] <AdamPDotty> cheetah :-)
[09:33:07] <DreamStiffler> wth now it works
[09:33:14] <DreamStiffler> must be my connection or something
[09:33:29] <ksm101> it should work as its very basic jquery stuff ^^
[09:34:23] <DreamStiffler> ok yeah it does
[09:34:30] <DreamStiffler> i was clicking checkbox 4
[09:34:33] <DreamStiffler> lol
[09:34:35] <ksm101> :D
[09:34:40] <DreamStiffler> thanks bud
[09:35:15] <DreamStiffler> this was mine before that ...https://jsfiddle.net/3515mgp7/3/ ...thanks for the fix
[09:36:02] <ksm101> U're welcome, I guess you could get cleaner solutions, but this one is at least easy to set up and to understand
[09:36:08] <AdamPDotty> https://jsfiddle.net/3515mgp7/9/
[09:36:50] <ksm101> Yeah, a bit better again :)
[09:37:58] <AdamPDotty> The long way ahead leads to paradise step by step.
[09:43:24] <DreamStiffler> thanks for /9/ too
[09:49:49] <DreamStiffler> trying at my local gets this :  Syntax error, unrecognized expression: :nth-child     at Function.Sizzle.error
[09:49:54] <DreamStiffler> jquery 1.7
[09:49:56] <DreamStiffler> tf
[09:50:48] <Uhkis> sounds like bad quoting
[09:51:38] <ksm101> If you're using Adam's solution, there's no "nth-child" use at all
[09:55:46] <Flerex> does anyone know why this chaining is not working? https://pastebin.com/1QERSSN5
[09:56:06] <Flerex> the console log prints the complete website returned by the ajax call, not the array
[10:05:59] <DreamStiffler> Uhkis: yea quoting...
[10:06:32] <DreamStiffler> ksm101: im sticking to yours first, even so AdamPDottys ways is simpler, but i had to mod a little and im unsure to do with his
[10:06:45] <DreamStiffler> will look at it back when i have more time
[10:08:00] <ksm101> I still recommand using a class toggle instead of .css() though, like Adam did
[10:08:12] <DreamStiffler> ksm101: any reasons
[10:09:08] <ksm101> No deep thinking here, I just find it cleaner... maybe some expert could tell which is best but I'm not -)
[10:09:48] <ksm101> + toggling class is just one action
[10:10:01] <ksm101> less code :)
[10:16:18] <DreamStiffler> yea less code tempting, will try to apply to mine.
[10:16:22] <DreamStiffler> thanks again everyone
[10:16:27] <DreamStiffler> will be back with resuly

[10:39:58] <traptrip> I'm not talking about an adjacent sibling, these are different tags, but they are on the same level in the DOM

[10:51:58] <Christian_> hi
[11:29:18] <PCatinean> hey guys how do I turn 3.290555555555555 into a timesmap?
[12:21:10] <zanric> Question if anyone has a moment, Do you know of a good plugin to handle large amounts of check boxes with subsections with checkall features?
[12:22:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:22:25] <robertmaxrees> what's "large amounts"?
[12:23:25] <zanric> I guess medium amount would do honestly I don't know how many I'll have to deal with when the production data is entered in. But 100 or more I guess
[12:23:45] <robertmaxrees> the number doesn't really matter tbh.
[12:23:48] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy thing to build out.
[12:24:48] <zanric> I haven't spent a lot of time with javascript honestly so I figured I'd ask before I started constructing something myself.
[12:25:01] <robertmaxrees> nah.  i'll even get you started.
[12:25:08] <robertmaxrees> feelin' charitable.
[12:25:16] <zanric> mostly javascript is just a tool to do ajax for me.
[12:28:25] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dwnjLefj/
[12:28:27] <robertmaxrees> that's the basic idea.
[12:29:15] <zanric> Thanks I appreciate the example!
[13:47:57] <G66K> hello everyone
[13:48:04] <taplar> aloha
[13:48:06] <G66K> is there a better way to complish this => https://pastebin.com/ZgD47U6Q
[13:48:32] <randymarsh9> do jquery animations not work on mobile iphone safari?
[13:49:14] <taplar> G66K: how can you click on something that has a class of hide?
[13:49:40] <taplar> oh wait, your using a class binding and an id lookup
[13:50:13] <G66K> note: the code is working im just wondering if there a better way then the one i used
[13:50:20] <taplar> looks fine to me
[13:50:42] <taplar> just reading it i believe i understand your intentions
[13:51:19] <G66K> addclass removeclass doesnt has a toggle ?
[13:51:41] <taplar> you are changing different elements
[13:51:50] <taplar> and this is more explicit
[13:53:17] <taplar> what's the problem with the code?
[13:56:38] <G66K> taplar: code is working fine im just trying to make it shorter and effective
[13:56:45] <G66K> this is final result i came with https://pastebin.com/Qh4CgyLS
[13:56:50] <taplar> shorter doesn't always === better
[13:57:15] <G66K> taplar: there is shorter and better and shoter and screwed
[13:57:27] <G66K> shorter*
[13:57:28] <taplar> are you able to double click '.login'?
[13:58:19] <taplar> cause if you can, clicking login will cause register to show again
[13:58:21] <G66K> taplar: screwed
[13:58:25] <taplar> yep
[13:58:31] <taplar> i'm telling you man
[13:58:32] <G66K> i just pay attention once you said so
[13:58:45] <taplar> being explicit saves your ass most time
[13:59:08] <G66K> taplar: im just playing with jquery :)
[15:37:35] <rizonz> hi guys!
[15:37:54] <rizonz> when I use .remove() I think my element is still stored in cache so can be brought back
[15:38:10] <rizonz> but can I also load elements into cache by default and do a .show() on them ?
[15:41:15] <taplar> remove() removes the element from the DOM and destroys any data that jquery stores about the object
[15:46:13] <rizonz> taplar: that is weird because I can bring it back with .show
[15:46:30] <rizonz>  show()
[15:47:13] <taplar> show me?
[15:48:18] <rizonz> taplar: can't as it's a deb system but it does, I have some template I generate using Zend Framework where I do that on a form select
[15:48:27] <rizonz> it's really gone from my page source and back on .show()
[15:48:49] <taplar> it doesn't have to be the whole thing.  you should be able to replicate that on a fiddle
[15:49:31] <darcyclarke> taplar + rizonz just tried this in a fiddle... pretty sure that's a big nope: https://jsfiddle.net/pqLd77px/1/
[15:49:53] <rizonz> darcyclarke: I see it happening here...
[15:50:02] <rizonz> cal me a lyar but I'm not
[15:50:15] <darcyclarke> Can you reproduce in a fiddle?
[15:50:18] <taplar> not calling you a lier
[15:50:20] <darcyclarke> Not calling you a lier
[15:50:25] <darcyclarke> liar*
[15:50:27] <taplar> i'm suggesting you are doing something you are not explaining to us
[15:50:34] <darcyclarke> Just want to try and figure out how that is happening
[15:50:34] <taplar> which is causing the result you are seeing
[15:50:47] <taplar> because the operation of remove() is pretty clear
[15:51:02] <darcyclarke> maybe its an order of operations thing or maybe you've cloned it and are referencing a different element somehow.
[15:51:13] <rizonz> darcyclarke: nag too much code involved
[15:51:32] <rizonz> yeah but then it should be somewhere
[15:51:36] <taplar> https://j11y.io/jquery/#v=2.1.3&fn=jQuery.fn.remove
[15:51:42] <darcyclarke> is it online? maybe I could check out your usecase/problem
[15:51:42] <rizonz> I think it's really in the browsercache
[15:51:52] <randymarsh9> nevermind turns out i had another piece of code freezing up the animation
[15:51:58] <rizonz> darcyclarke: no not yet, need to push 300 servers for it :)
[15:52:44] <taplar> how are you doing the remove?
[15:52:55] <taplar> off of a selector or an object?
[15:53:12] <rizonz> div where it's in
[15:53:18] <taplar> selector or objec?
[15:53:22] <rizonz> but I use a cacheIdentyfier
[15:53:34] <rizonz> taplar: erm, I need to check that all again... has been a while
[15:55:26] <rizonz> it's really weird, I see it vanishing from my source (console) and comes back when I select the box when it should show up again
[15:55:37] <rizonz> using show()
[15:55:46] <taplar> you haven't answered my question yet
[15:56:54] <rizonz> taplar: selector
[15:57:03] <taplar> id or class?
[15:57:11] <rizonz> class
[15:57:19] <taplar> and are you doing the same thing for the show?
[15:57:23] <rizonz> yes
[15:57:32] <darcyclarke> rizonz: someone may have overriden your .remove() fn... check out this fiddle for reference: https://jsfiddle.net/pqLd77px/3/
[15:57:37] <taplar> then i would suggest that something else is putting it back on the page before hand
[15:57:54] <rizonz> mhh
[15:58:13] <taplar> $(selector) doesn't necessarily return the same object.  It finds the element in the DOM at that point in time
[15:58:51] <taplar> if you were doing something like $myVar = $(selector);  $myVar.remove();  $myVar.show();  then you would not see that behavior
[15:58:56] <rizonz> mhh I wonder
[15:59:08] <rizonz> taplar: I do that indeed
[15:59:24] <taplar> exactly, without another lookup in between?  only one assignment to $myVar?
[15:59:34] <rizonz> yap
[15:59:41] <taplar> now i think you're lying
[15:59:48] <rizonz> oh!
[15:59:59] <rizonz> taplar: lookup like ?>
[16:00:05] <taplar> $(selector)
[16:00:30] <rizonz> I can paste the functino itself, is that helpfull ?
[16:00:33] <taplar> just like darcyclarke linked
[16:01:06] <darcyclarke> http://jsfiddle.net
[16:01:23] <taplar> oh wait, was that someone else?
[16:01:31] <rizonz> yeah but I cannot place all formfields in there
[16:01:37] <taplar> no i was right,  https://jsfiddle.net/pqLd77px/1/
[16:01:51] <taplar> ^ that shows the logic
[16:02:16] <taplar> without another selector to find new elements, the elements in the first variable will no longer exist
[16:02:21] <taplar> *on the page
[16:03:00] <rizonz> sec
[16:04:47] <rizonz> taplar: darcyclarke this is what my code does https://jsfiddle.net/Yamakasi/8tL636tr/1/
[16:05:49] <taplar> does initPreSignupForm get called each time?
[16:06:11] <rizonz> nope
[16:06:19] <rizonz> I can do a log, sec
[16:06:32] <taplar> which variable is the one being removed and shown?
[16:07:31] <rizonz> domainselect
[16:08:01] <rizonz> actually domainName
[16:08:23] <rizonz> it's only loaded on pageload that init
[16:09:14] <taplar> i don't see where you are removing domainName
[16:09:55] <rizonz> oh no sorry domainSelect
[16:11:01] <taplar> $(".domainselect").show();
[16:11:06] <taplar> you're doing a lookup on the page
[16:11:15] <taplar> it will find any that exist on the page at that point in time
[16:11:30] <taplar> domainSelect.remove();  <-- not the one referenced there
[16:11:55] <taplar> something is adding it back to the page before the show
[16:12:16] <rizonz> mhh I need to see what because there is no refresh or what
[16:14:31] <rizonz> taplar: nothing in console about it
[16:14:42] <taplar> why would there be?
[16:15:16] <taplar> the browser doesn't write to the console every time a node is created
[16:15:19] <rizonz> because you say anything should place it back upfront, it's loaded data from a database so I should see some get
[16:15:39] <taplar> doesn't have to be a get
[16:15:49] <taplar> logic can make nodes without ajax
[16:16:21] <taplar> if you want, put a console log after the remove and before the show doing a length off of the selector and see what you get
[16:17:09] <rizonz> taplar: like how ? console.log(...?)
[16:17:15] <taplar> console.log($(".domainselect").length);
[16:17:27] <taplar> after the remove, and before the show
[16:17:58] <taplar> console.log("Remove", $(".domainselect").length); <-- maybe give it a lead in string for easy identification
[16:19:13] <rizonz> the .dname remove ?
[16:19:39] <taplar> we've been talking about the removal of the select
[16:21:10] <rizonz> I get back 0
[16:21:14] <rizonz> Remove
[16:21:16] <rizonz> oops
[16:21:19] <rizonz> Remove 0
[16:21:27] <taplar> and what about before the show
[16:22:14] <rizonz> also
[16:24:39] <taplar> ?
[16:30:41] <rizonz> taplar: also Remove: 0
[16:31:14] <taplar> you put that right before line 54?
[16:31:20] <taplar> er, 55
[16:31:31] <taplar> in relation to this fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/Yamakasi/8tL636tr/1/
[16:31:34] <rizonz> yes
[16:31:37] <rizonz> yes
[16:31:55] <rizonz> and after line 58
[16:32:18] <taplar> what about immediately after 55?
[16:33:01] <rizonz> also Remove 0
[16:33:20] <taplar> ok, so, the remove removed it, and it doesn't exist at the time you try to show it, so that isn't doing anything
[16:33:25] <rizonz> would it relly not be in cache ?
[16:33:31] <taplar> no
[16:33:41] <taplar> i already explained what remove() does earlier
[16:33:46] <rizonz> yes you did
[16:33:53] <taplar> and show() doesn't attach things to the page
[16:34:04] <rizonz> nope
[16:34:08] <taplar> and since the selector is returning 0, it's not on the page
[16:34:14] <taplar> at that time
[16:34:21] <rizonz> indeed, is this magic ?
[16:34:38] <taplar> no, you just got some logic some where that you are not aware of
[16:35:31] <taplar> i wonder
[16:35:38] <taplar> comment out this line: domainName.html(domainSelect);
[16:35:44] <rizonz> I created that part last year with your great help :)
[16:35:49] <rizonz> nah the end of 2015
[16:36:00] <taplar> really?
[16:36:04] <rizonz> yap
[16:36:15] <taplar> damn, lol.  literally no memory
[16:36:25] <rizonz> no, I was new to this
[16:36:33] <rizonz> sec, I can check if there is something done
[16:36:52] <taplar> i'm wondering if that html() is taking the object and putting it back on the page
[16:36:57] <rizonz> yuou were pretty busy back those days
[16:37:11] <rizonz> can I log that ?
[16:37:25] <taplar> just comment it out.  if it doesn't re-appear, boom
[16:37:55] <rizonz> yap
[16:37:59] <rizonz> doesn't come back
[16:38:04] <taplar> yeah so that's what it was
[16:38:06] <rizonz> something remembers me
[16:38:12] <taplar> https://j11y.io/jquery/#v=2.1.3&fn=jQuery.fn.html
[16:38:19] <rizonz> I place backt he whole html ?
[16:38:22] <rizonz> *back
[16:38:24] <rizonz> yes!
[16:38:24] <taplar> it checks to see if it is a dom element, and if so it returns the innerHTML
[16:38:39] <rizonz> the "old" html ?
[16:38:40] <taplar> so your variable is your 'cache'
[16:38:44] <rizonz> yes
[16:38:52] <rizonz> aha!
[16:39:06] <rizonz> so I get it back from a variable cache ?
[16:39:17] <taplar> pretty much
[16:39:29] <taplar> all of it's jquery data will be wiped though
[16:39:56] <rizonz> ok, but that is done in a different file
[16:40:40] <rizonz> the reason why I ask, I need to add some extra dropdowns, but I first need to load them into my page and just hide them I think
[16:40:55] <rizonz> this select is the first shown, so that is why it can come back form the var
[16:41:47] <taplar> you might want to change that to be .empty().append(theObject)
[16:42:30] <rizonz> the object then is $(".domainselect") ?
[16:42:38] <taplar> no, one sec
[16:42:41] <rizonz> ok
[16:42:52] <taplar> domainName.empty.append(domainSelect);
[16:42:55] <taplar> err
[16:42:59] <taplar> domainName.empty().append(domainSelect);
[16:43:25] <rizonz> yap, could be done as well, looks better
[16:43:28] <taplar> since it looked like html() was doing an innerHTML off the object, you might have been losing a layer of code
[16:43:31] <rizonz> why place back the whole HTML ?
[16:43:45] <taplar> did you not want the whole object?
[16:44:00] <taplar> since that's what got removed
[16:44:00] <rizonz> html() contains my full source ?
[16:44:21] <rizonz> or only what I removed() ?
[16:44:32] <taplar> html() get the innerHTML off of the elements if it is a dom element
[16:44:44] <taplar> which will be the child nodes of it
[16:44:47] <taplar> not itself
[16:44:49] <rizonz> so then I cache it upfront
[16:45:01] <taplar> outerHTML contains an elements self as well as the child nodes
[16:45:19] <rizonz> ok, so is there cache used then ?
[16:45:30] <taplar> nope.  just your variable
[16:45:53] <rizonz> ok and the dome exactly knows what to place back as innerHTML ?
[16:45:56] <rizonz> *DOM
[16:46:08] <taplar> the variable contains what you removed
[16:46:17] <taplar> javascript is just putting back what you have in the variable
[16:46:26] <taplar> DOM is ignorant
[16:46:34] <taplar> it's just being given data to insert
[16:46:34] <rizonz> aha!
[16:46:49] <rizonz> then this way is pretty ackward
[16:47:27] <robertmaxrees> and synful
[16:47:32] * robertmaxrees rimshots
[16:47:41] <taplar> lol
[16:47:55] <taplar> for a second i was like, what does geometry have to do with this?
[16:47:57] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: oh you are also still here :D
[16:48:29] <taplar> my sister's brothers daughter is my cosine
[16:48:29] <rizonz> taplar: if I do a remove after it, the var html() get's overridden I think ?
[16:48:42] <rizonz> lol
[16:49:08] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[16:49:20] <taplar> *brother's .... dang it
[16:49:24] <taplar> mothers!!!
[16:49:27] * taplar gives up
[16:50:16] <rizonz> haha
[16:50:42] <taplar> my sister's brother is a dumbass
[16:51:05] <rizonz> I only care if she is HOT
[16:51:25] <rizonz> hehe
[16:51:35] <rizonz> otherwise I feel sorry for you
[16:51:42] <rizonz> for the bother of your sister
[16:51:45] <rizonz> *brother
[16:52:42] <rizonz> taplar: it doesn't tell me if it "overrides"  hello when I remove goodbye after it and place back html()
[16:55:38] <taplar> "Use .remove() when you want to remove the element itself, as well as everything inside it. In addition to the elements themselves, all bound events and jQuery data associated with the elements are removed."
[16:56:16] <taplar> Nothing else
[16:56:27] <rizonz> taplar: true but will be the data in my selectbox still there then ?
[16:56:35] <rizonz> as it's a dynamic one
[16:56:47] <taplar> it's an element in the dom with children
[16:56:57] <taplar> the element is removed from the page
[16:57:05] <taplar> + that other stuff
[16:57:08] <rizonz> and that is "cached" ?
[16:57:08] <taplar> that's all
[16:57:14] <taplar> no dude
[16:57:23] <taplar> you're really eager for this cache thing
[16:57:32] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[16:57:32] <rizonz> he, relax or I will your sisters brother :P
[16:57:48] <taplar> the variable will remain what it referenced until you change it
[16:57:51] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: I better can tell you directly :P
[16:57:58] <rizonz> ok
[16:58:27] <rizonz> but it's stored somewhere
[16:58:36] <taplar> in the variable so long as it is in scope
[16:58:41] <rizonz> ok
[16:58:56] <taplar> if the variable leaves scope, it will be lost and available for garbage collection
[16:59:29] <taplar> provided you are doing something with a variable
[16:59:40] <taplar> if you just do $(selector).remove() then that bad boy is gone gone
[17:00:00] <robertmaxrees> forever
[17:00:03] <rizonz> ok, and empty doesn't do that
[17:00:11] <taplar> empty() removes children
[17:00:13] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:00:23] <robertmaxrees> the node itself remains.  but its children don't.
[17:00:43] <rizonz> so how do I get it back ?
[17:00:51] <rizonz> as it was
[17:00:51] <taplar> you recreate them
[17:01:02] <taplar> you have to generate them again
[17:01:05] <rizonz> yes and that was the issue I remember, I can';t
[17:01:10] <rizonz> that is why html() is used
[17:01:23] <taplar> you're not doing an empty
[17:01:28] <taplar> you're doing a remove()
[17:02:04] <taplar> You're doing A.remove() and then later B.empty().append(A)
[17:02:25] <taplar> A !== B
[17:03:47] <rizonz> yes
[17:04:06] <rizonz> but remove removed it as gone gone ?
[17:04:27] <taplar> you're not doing $(selector).remove()
[17:04:42] <rizonz> ah! indeed
[17:05:01] <taplar> even if you did, you already have a variable referencing it, so that still exists
[17:05:28] <rizonz> yeah html ?
[17:05:35] <taplar> huh?
[17:06:42] <rizonz> oh no!
[17:06:47] <rizonz> it's in domainSelect
[17:06:58] <rizonz> true ?
[17:07:02] <taplar> yup
[17:07:04] <rizonz> :D
[17:07:07] <rizonz> I need to kiss you
[17:07:11] <taplar> nupe
[17:07:18] <rizonz> I did that in 2015 as well, you like it
[17:07:20] <rizonz> *liked it
[17:07:27] <rizonz> robertmaxrees: even for jalous ;)
[17:07:31] <rizonz> *got
[17:07:35] <taplar> i'm feeling more and more like you were helped by another person
[17:07:43] <rizonz> no, it was you!
[17:07:51] <taplar> maybe Cork
[17:07:54] <rizonz> you were working on some massive mobile app
[17:07:56] <rizonz> also
[17:08:00] <taplar> yep, someone else
[17:08:05] <rizonz> no also you
[17:08:17] <taplar> lol, i've never worked on a mobile app
[17:08:17] <rizonz> Cork: wanted the real stuff, no kisses no foreplay... I got scared
[17:08:49] <rizonz> remember what you did in december 2015
[17:08:58] <taplar> work related, sure
[17:09:02] <rizonz> except eating yourself fat during Christmas
[17:09:12] <taplar> ~.~
[17:09:16] <rizonz> :)
[17:09:33] <rizonz> Cork was a girl ?
[17:09:41] <rizonz> or still is I hope in that case
[17:09:42] <taplar> was?
[17:10:13] <taplar> yeah, now he's known as Co...... nvm
[17:10:22] <rizonz> lolz
[17:10:39] <bjsnider> is it wrong to constnatly use console.log to debug things?
[17:10:44] <rizonz> no but there was a female opp here or in ##javascript I remember
[17:10:44] <taplar> nope
[17:10:50] <taplar> console.log away
[17:10:51] <rizonz> bjsnider: no!
[17:10:51] <bjsnider> i just think it's the most useful thing in javascript
[17:11:00] <taplar> you could also use the debugger
[17:11:04] <bjsnider> i'd be totally lost wihtout it
[17:11:06] <taplar> or use the debugger; statement
[17:11:25] <rizonz> bjsnider: I was loggin I ... love ... taplar how much further I came in my code
[17:11:41] <rizonz> it made me happy
[17:12:00] <taplar> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide4
[17:12:23] <taplar> left and right arrows if you're not familiar with the site
[17:12:58] <rizonz> taplar: what shall I do for other dropdowns, selects... place them and hide them ?
[17:13:19] <rizonz> or store them as a var and remove them on init ?
[17:13:38] <bjsnider> of course i've always got the console open to check for errors, but i mean, if i'm trying to capture something, or i expect a var to contain something, without console.log how the hell would i know if these things were happening?
[17:13:45] <taplar> i can't really say.  i'm not familiar with your app to have a good idea of what would be best.
[17:13:55] <taplar> with the debugger bjsnider
[17:14:01] <taplar> seriously, read that site, lol
[17:14:12] <rizonz> I need to remove them otherwise they will be posted even hidden
[17:14:23] <taplar> rizonz: disabled inputs are not submitted
[17:14:34] <taplar> you could hide and disable them
[17:14:53] <bjsnider> rizonz: that php app also has a lot of javascript i guess?
[17:14:57] <taplar> $(selector).prop('disabled', true).hide()
[17:15:01] <rizonz> bjsnider: lots
[17:15:09] <rizonz> bjsnider: why ?
[17:15:24] <rizonz> taplar: yap could be handy as wel
[17:15:26] <rizonz> well
[17:15:31] <bjsnider> wondered if you were working on that same app
[17:16:39] <rizonz> bjsnider: which app ?
[17:17:04] <bjsnider> the one you keep working on in ##php
[17:17:21] <rizonz> bjsnider: oh yeah! you are there as well :)
[17:17:37] <bjsnider> your "product" as you put it
[17:18:14] <rizonz> bjsnider: yes, so ?
[17:18:52] <bjsnider> just asking
[17:20:04] <rizonz> bjsnider: what are you building ?
[17:20:27] <bjsnider> oh, a couple of things for a client
[17:20:32] <bjsnider> nothing special
[17:20:42] <bjsnider> php/html/js
[17:20:46] <rizonz> it's always special :)
[17:20:47] <bjsnider> the usual suspects
[17:21:12] <bjsnider> certainly not the massive size of your project
[17:21:47] <rizonz> bjsnider: yeah and I'm fixing shit :)
[17:23:28] <bjsnider> there were bound to be issues with that much code
[17:23:52] <rizonz> how do you mean ?
[17:27:52] <bjsnider> just the size of it, IIRC it's something like 6 times bigger than wordpress, the odds are greater that there will be issues
[17:28:09] <bjsnider> vs. one simple litle script, not a lot can go wrong with it
[17:28:38] <rizonz> nah not like that
[17:29:13] <rizonz> the former dev changed things on the fly and didn't thinnk about the future in design and didn't document as well
[17:31:58] <robertmaxrees> you already said you had a dev working on it.
[17:32:02] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:33:14] <rizonz> hehe
[18:31:43] <gambl0re> hello?
[18:33:03] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[18:45:48] * robertmaxrees yawns
[18:45:55] <robertmaxrees> today is starting to drag.
[19:00:37] <taplar> i super happy
[19:00:55] <robertmaxrees> oh?
[19:00:56] <rizonz> me as well but I'm still thingabout what to do.. disable or remove
[19:01:41] <taplar> i started looking at our QAs environment, since they're having issues with it, and I think i'm figuring out a way we can remove some sunset'ed software in it
[19:01:52] <robertmaxrees> niiiice
[19:01:53] <robertmaxrees> well done.
[19:04:18] <taplar> i got it to open chrome and I let out an audible "hell yesssss!!!!"  good thing it's 18:00
[19:46:48] <bjsnider> console's spitting out a 500 error in response to an ajax post
[19:46:58] <bjsnider> but it must be working, i checked the vars, and they have the data
[19:47:56] <robertmaxrees> that's a server-side error
[19:49:21] <cannap> no its not
[19:49:24] <cannap> ^^
[19:49:56] <cannap> what for vars you checked
[19:50:03] <cannap> you should check the response
[19:50:08] <cannap> xD
[19:50:15] <robertmaxrees> wat
[19:50:26] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500
[19:50:33] <cannap> -.-
[19:50:46] <robertmaxrees> that's a server error.
[19:50:51] <bjsnider> ah yes, i told the php callback to throw an exception, but it didn't pass along the message i gave it, so i didn't realize that was the exception
[19:50:52] <cannap> i know...
[19:51:07] <bjsnider> now i know the callback is running
[19:51:10] <robertmaxrees> cannap then why did you say isn't not a server-side error?
[19:51:13] <robertmaxrees> *it isn't
[19:51:18] <cannap> beer :D
[19:51:24] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider rad.
[19:52:26] <robertmaxrees> wat
[19:53:04] <cannap> nvm sry @bjsnider just ignore what i say :D
[19:53:49] <bjsnider> ignore what who says?
[19:55:01] <cannap> just listen to robertmaxrees
[19:55:50] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:56:17] <bjsnider> i can't respond officially, since i am supposed to ignore you, so unofficially, i copy that
[19:57:08] <cannap> woaaaa :D
[19:59:40] <cannap> sry i just have tried to make a joke about your 500 server internal because you ask in jquery .. sorry again
[19:59:57] <bjsnider> in ajax posts, everything in the data object is posted as key => value, right?
[20:00:18] <bjsnider> you just invent whatever keys you want and assign values to them?
[20:00:46] <cannap> you want $,each
[20:00:51] <cannap> $.each
[20:00:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:00:58] <cannap> over an array with objects
[20:00:59] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider show us your code.
[20:02:39] <cannap> and an example response
[20:02:55] <robertmaxrees> cannap the response isn't going to help anmswer this question >.>
[20:02:56] <cannap> befor you try to loop over an string
[20:03:09] <robertmaxrees> he's asking about the data getting sent to the server.
[20:03:17] <cannap> oh
[20:03:26] <bjsnider> https://jsfiddle.net/2wtgf31u/
[20:03:40] <cannap> -.-
[20:03:53] <cannap> did you try wordpress restapi?
[20:04:07] <bjsnider> so $_POST['action'] = "callback, right?"
[20:04:21] <cannap> wordpress?
[20:04:50] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider should be formatted like a normal form post, yeah
[20:04:51] <robertmaxrees> iirc.
[20:05:00] <bjsnider> excellent
[20:12:38] <bjsnider> did that look particularly wordpressish?
[20:13:02] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[20:13:08] <robertmaxrees> your fiddle?
[20:17:04] <bjsnider> yeah
[20:17:06] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider also - async: false -_-
[20:17:08] <robertmaxrees> whyyyy
[20:17:22] <robertmaxrees> why do you want to lock the page?>
[20:20:18] <cannap> it looks like wodpressish for me because "action"
[20:20:28] <cannap> this is why i say
[20:20:32] <cannap> but nvm not a big deal
[20:40:58] <rizonz> solved :D
[20:41:09] <rizonz> I load all, remove 2 and then place them back when I need
[20:42:13] <rizonz> I'm sexyu!
[20:42:16] <rizonz> -u
[22:56:48] <Mrgoose2> sup everyone
[23:02:24] <jphase> 👋
[23:03:01] <Mrgoose2> playing around with some object literal stuff
[23:04:45] <Mrgoose2> trying to figure out the advantage of other design patterns
[23:05:40] <Mrgoose2> and keeping things organized
[23:05:47] <Mrgoose2> which design pattern do you use
[23:13:38] <jphase> I use object literal
[23:14:17] <jphase> honestly don't even remember why anymore it's just my habit I suppose 🤔
[23:14:45] <jphase> it also depends on if I'm stepping into someone else's code - I tend to chameleon to their conventions
