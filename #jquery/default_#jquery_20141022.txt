[00:00:10] <Mark___> oh well.
[00:00:31] <Mark___> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/board_lPQY33
[00:00:39] <Mark___> this one crashes with other jquery plugins
[00:00:45] <rkrara> doug64k: do you mean I should also set the href property to #
[00:00:47] <Mark___> so im looking for alternative…
[00:00:59] <doug64k> Mark___: http://demosthenes.info/blog/777/Create-Fullscreen-HTML5-Page-Background-Video
[00:01:21] <doug64k> rkrara: if it works without setting it I wouldn't worry. it's probably already '#'
[00:01:26] <Mark___> i followed the site above. and it didn’t work.
[00:01:29] <Mark___> but thanks.
[00:01:50] <doug64k> Mark___: define "didn't work"
[00:01:56] <rkrara> doug64k: its a link to a dialog
[00:02:02] <doug64k> didn't work as you need or didn't work at all?
[00:02:11] <Mark___> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/board_lPQY33 see how jquery plugin background is aligned nicely with the body
[00:02:38] <Mark___> and the page above only ‘puts’ video.
[00:02:43] <Mark___> lol
[00:03:00] <rkrara> doug64k: thanks for your help, can you tell me one more thing what is jquery mobile equivalent of $(document).ready(function)
[00:03:25] <rkrara> doug64k: in jquery
[00:03:39] <doug64k> rkrara: http://api.jquerymobile.com/pageinit/
[00:04:06] <doug64k> rkrara: http://api.jquerymobile.com/pagecreate/ in newer versions
[00:04:07] <rkrara> doug64k: there are so many pageinit pagecreate
[00:04:33] <doug64k> pageinit is old, pagecreate is new
[00:04:44] <doug64k> pageinit is deprecated
[00:05:50] <doug64k> Mark___: aligning problems would be css. any programmatic problem?
[00:06:12] <grodt> can someone help with a fadeout/fadein with jquery
[00:06:18] <doug64k> grodt: yes
[00:06:44] <Mark___> no. but i think it’s impossible to actually place video on the back of the page without using jquery.
[00:07:17] <grodt> http://sodacrunch.com/dev/valens/services.html is the page http://hastebin.com/atumogoqon.coffee is the code I use, I only have the effect for the top 3 buttons on the side
[00:07:19] <doug64k> Mark___: well, first thought here: position: fixed; top: 0px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px;
[00:07:41] <grodt> its supposed to fadeout then fadein, its kinda doing it...but all janky
[00:07:50] <doug64k> and add html,body { position: relative; height: 100%; }
[00:07:58] <doug64k> Mark___: ^
[00:08:29] <doug64k> oops
[00:08:32] <Mark___> i think i already tried it lol
[00:08:39] <doug64k> and add html,body { position: relative; min-height: 100%; }
[00:08:44] <grodt> I used a callback, not sure why its not being smooth
[00:09:12] <rkrara> doug64k: Error: cannot call methods on navbar prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'option'
[00:09:50] <rkrara> doug64k: I have jqm v1.3 and I use pageinit at the moment but unfortunately keep getting that error
[00:10:18] <doug64k> rkrara: what selector are you binding the event handler to
[00:10:42] <rkrara> doug64k: a page on the navbar
[00:11:26] <doug64k> rkrara: on the navbar??
[00:11:56] <rkrara> doug64k: sorry actually it the div after the body tag
[00:12:06] <doug64k> rkrara: bind it to the data-role="page" element
[00:12:29] <rkrara> doug64k: ok, thanks
[00:13:38] <rkrara> doug64k: currently its on a div (that is right after body tag) with data-role page
[00:14:10] <rkrara> doug64k: and then the navbar is inside that div of which property i want to change but get error
[00:18:18] <rkrara> does some one know how can i test my application(simulator , emulator tools) to make sure it works equally well on android, windows mobile and desktop browser. Currently It works well on desktop and with lags on android and unusable on windows mobile (i have nokia lumia 800)
[00:19:24] <grodt> doug64k, any lukc?
[00:20:30] <rkrara> jquery mobile documentation says a grade support for all of these but unfortunately its seems not correct for me
[00:22:25] <doug64k> grodt: does this work for you http://www.jstraight.com/1117/1
[00:22:33] <doug64k> or does it stutter too
[00:23:18] <grodt> doug64k, its fading in and out, loops
[00:23:29] <doug64k> I know. smoooth?
[00:23:33] <grodt> yup
[00:23:50] <doug64k> and my code is same as yours except mine loops, right?
[00:24:02] <grodt>  ya what the hell
[00:24:12] <doug64k> what are you fading
[00:24:34] <grodt> the content on the right
[00:24:42] <grodt> that title and text below it, its in a div container
[00:24:50] <grodt> i fade them out and fade in the right one
[00:25:20] <doug64k> grodt: sorry, forgot you linked real site
[00:26:14] <doug64k> grodt: home about services etc things?
[00:26:23] <doug64k> fade is perfect for me
[00:26:30] <doug64k> is debugger console open? that kills performance
[00:26:46] <doug64k> it won't build native code in ff
[00:27:03] <grodt> hmmm
[00:27:28] <doug64k> the mouseover fade right?
[00:27:33] <doug64k> to white
[00:27:34] <doug64k> ?
[00:27:44] <grodt> like if I click services on the left menu
[00:28:02] <grodt> it will show the div to fade in, first on the bottom, then top div fades and bottom div moves up
[00:28:12] <grodt> its not in order, like fadeout, then fadein new div
[00:28:18] <doug64k> grodt: it's a bug...
[00:28:29] <grodt> my code?
[00:28:31] <doug64k> in your click handler, do you stopPropagation?
[00:28:43] <doug64k> I bet you are firing that handler multiple times
[00:28:57] <grodt> I have to add a .stop(). right?
[00:29:02] <doug64k> no
[00:29:26] <grodt> I load the page, and I click Training for example, just that one click doesnt show the effect right
[00:29:54] <grodt> as soon as I click training, it shows the traning div at bottom of screen before top div has faded out
[00:29:59] <doug64k> grodt: try changing $(".s-menu-item").click(function() {    to    $(".s-menu-item").click(function(event) { event.stopPropagation(); ...
[00:31:01] <grodt> no luck
[00:31:09] <grodt> its still showing the div before the other fades out
[00:31:31] <doug64k> grodt: yeah... weird. still looking at debugger
[00:31:55] <grodt> for you it appears fine? smooth?
[00:32:25] <doug64k> no
[00:32:32] <doug64k> it is smooth but it fades wrong
[00:32:51] <doug64k> pulsates an extra time when it shouldn't
[00:32:54] <doug64k> thats your issue?
[00:32:56] <grodt> its driving me nuts, because ive done this 100 times before, but this time its all janky...
[00:33:04] <grodt> yea the pulsate is another issue id idnt even mention
[00:33:17] <doug64k> that bug is probably causing bad performance too
[00:33:18] <grodt> im wondering if I should try a differ jquery version
[00:33:34] <doug64k> grodt: unlikely
[00:33:39] <grodt> hmmmm
[00:33:47] <grodt> this is such a simple thing, duno why its all jacked up
[00:33:53] <doug64k> you are almost certainly commanding jquery to do that weird fade
[00:35:36] <doug64k> grodt: the fadeOut is fading them all
[00:35:45] <grodt> yup
[00:35:50] <doug64k> then you get spammed with all the completions right?
[00:35:56] <doug64k> lol 1 sec
[00:36:11] <grodt> I did that so I dont have to specify what div is on the screen
[00:36:35] <doug64k> grodt: but n fades will be more laggy than 1 fade
[00:36:52] <doug64k> hold on, try this:
[00:37:26] <doug64k> $(".content-container").fadeOut("slow").promise().done(function() { $("." + dname).fadeIn('slow'); })
[00:37:49] <doug64k> that will only run the .done once when all fades are done
[00:38:26] <doug64k> grodt: ^
[00:38:31] <grodt> trying now
[00:39:20] <grodt> dude
[00:39:22] <grodt> you did it!
[00:39:27] <doug64k> :D
[00:39:35] <grodt> so me fading them all out
[00:39:38] <grodt> that was messing it up?
[00:39:41] <grodt> thanks!!!
[00:39:47] <doug64k> if you fade 10 elements you get 10 callbacks
[00:39:52] <grodt> ohhhhh
[00:39:54] <grodt> ok now that makes sense
[00:40:17] <grodt> thanks agian man, I would have been stumped for so long
[00:40:35] <doug64k> promise() makes a deferred promise that will only be done when all animations are done, then you can get 1 callback
[00:40:48] <grodt> perfect
[00:41:27] <doug64k> grodt: np
[00:41:48] <doug64k> rkrara1: do you get any errors in the console?
[00:42:55] <doug64k> I know some versions of jqm will throw exceptions at startup and misbehave
[00:48:33] <rkrara1> @doug64k at the moment I am working on desktop everything seems fine. thanks for your help
[00:48:50] <doug64k> np
[00:49:27] <rkrara1> do you know of any tools emulator i can use to emulate at least android browser
[00:50:49] <rkrara1> other than android sdk
[00:55:52] <doug64k> Mark___: is this ok? http://www.jstraight.com/1118/1
[00:56:58] <doug64k> it works in chrome, might need a bit of massaging of the css for vendor prefixes
[00:59:30] <Mark___> im not seeing any video.
[00:59:35] <Mark___> doug64:
[00:59:57] <Mark___> dough64k: whoot
[01:00:06] <Mark___> oops
[01:00:12] <Mark___> doug64k: hehe
[01:00:17] <doug64k> Mark___: THIS is more bulletproof http://www.jstraight.com/1118/2
[01:00:42] <Mark___> doug64k: im not seeing any video.
[01:00:48] <doug64k> Mark___: did you click run?
[01:00:57] <Mark___> yes.
[01:01:06] <doug64k> Mark___: which browser
[01:01:14] <Mark___> chrome for mac
[01:01:18] <Mark___> o nevermind
[01:01:20] <Mark___> safari
[01:02:10] <doug64k> maybe it can't decode webm
[01:02:28] <doug64k> try changing the src to a video you want to use in the video tag and clic run
[01:02:46] <Mark___> i tried it still don’t work.
[01:02:54] <Mark___> did you code this by yourself?
[01:02:58] <doug64k> Mark___: yes
[01:03:08] <doug64k> I made the site too
[01:03:09] <Mark___> hehe, thanks for the effort
[01:03:13] <Mark___> for sure?
[01:03:19] <doug64k> yes
[01:03:27] <Mark___> lol
[01:03:31] <Mark___> i find that hard to believe
[01:03:36] <doug64k> believe it
[01:03:41] <Mark___> why would you wanna make a site about webm files?
[01:03:46] <doug64k> what?
[01:03:51] <doug64k> I made http://www.jstraight.com/1118/2 site
[01:04:11] <Mark___> ah…
[01:04:14] <doug64k> what were you asking
[01:04:46] <Mark___> hmm?
[01:04:46] <doug64k> Mark___: tell me this: do video tags work at all for you?
[01:04:54] <Mark___> no..
[01:04:59] <Mark___> it’s not working.
[01:05:07] <doug64k> I mean at all, ever
[01:05:13] <Mark___> but i’d take the effort.
[01:05:21] <Mark___> how do you mean?
[01:05:29] <doug64k> try it on a real browser :)
[01:05:42] <Mark___> okay..
[01:05:59] <doug64k> that should be perfectly what you wanted
[01:07:50] <doug64k> Mark___: also try http://www.jstraight.com/1118/2/show
[01:08:11] <Mark___> sweet
[01:08:13] <Mark___> thanks man
[01:08:23] <Mark___> it works.
[01:08:26] <doug64k> cool
[01:08:43] <Mark___> i was having my hopes down, you saved it!
[01:08:56] <Mark___> um there’s one problem,
[01:08:56] <doug64k> :D
[01:09:02] <Mark___> how do you make it repeat itself?
[01:09:13] <doug64k> I think add repeat attibute
[01:09:16] <doug64k> in the video tag
[01:09:32] <TuomasL> just need mp4 alternate src for IE and Safari there
[01:10:06] <TuomasL> add "loop" in the video tag
[01:10:43] <doug64k> Mark___: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video
[01:11:21] <Mark___> thanks.
[01:12:29] <Mark___> loops gets me an error
[01:12:29] <Noor_egy> hello
[01:12:36] <Mark___> hi
[01:12:38] <doug64k> Mark___: loop
[01:12:47] <Mark___> *loop
[01:12:48] <Mark___> sorry.
[01:13:04] <Mark___> <video autoplay src="http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/layouts/layout_blur/video/ocean.mp4" loop="loop">
[01:13:50] <doug64k> Mark___: works for me http://www.jstraight.com/1118/3
[01:14:03] <Noor_egy> i have question i have an click on button  event which have inside it the ajax request  i want when the success change the value of the button i use $(".button").val("new value");  but seems its not work cause its not in the scope  ???
[01:14:41] <doug64k> Noor_egy: hard to believe
[01:14:46] <Noor_egy> \?
[01:14:49] <uskerine> is it possible to have two $(document).ready(function()   definitions?
[01:14:55] <doug64k> uskerine: yes
[01:15:02] <doug64k> infinite
[01:15:13] <TuomasL> just loop, not loop="loop"
[01:16:11] <doug64k> uskerine: you can constantly register more ready callbacks. if it;s already ready it just calls it immediaely
[01:17:39] <doug64k> if not it saves them up and calls them all when ready
[01:18:32] <Noor_egy> doug64k: what do you mean ?
[01:18:52] <doug64k> Noor_egy: your assesment of what's happening doesn't sound right. I'd have to see the code though
[01:19:08] <doug64k> Noor_egy: normally closure will make the scope ok
[01:20:08] <doug64k> Noor_egy: but if your variables are at too high of a scope, it can cause it to seem that way
[01:21:22] <Noor_egy> http://jsfiddle.net/uoLg31ry/ doug64k:
[01:22:03] <doug64k> Noor_egy: bug is $(this)
[01:22:04] <Noor_egy> $(this).val(data.label); dont whork $(this)= the button
[01:22:07] <Noor_egy> yes
[01:22:25] <doug64k> http://jsfiddle.net/uoLg31ry/1/
[01:22:42] <doug64k> 'this' is the 'this' of the success callback, not the one you think it is
[01:22:51] <doug64k> I captured this as self in closure. that will work
[01:23:18] <doug64k> oops
[01:23:32] <doug64k> Noor_egy: http://jsfiddle.net/uoLg31ry/2/
[01:24:16] <Noor_egy> so this is for the ajax request
[01:24:28] <doug64k> that 'this' is the success callback
[01:24:39] <doug64k> so I captured the 'this' you want
[01:24:49] <Noor_egy> but self is for the main method that i use
[01:24:59] <doug64k> Noor_egy: did you try it
[01:25:14] <Noor_egy> i try it now but i want understand
[01:25:23] <Noor_egy> this for the response of ajax
[01:25:36] <doug64k> the 'this' it calls you with there is NOT the button
[01:25:53] <doug64k> the success callback doesn't magically know what this you want
[01:26:06] <doug64k> it can't know
[01:26:16] <doug64k> so I save it in closure...
[01:26:17] <Noor_egy> ah ok
[01:26:30] <doug64k> then later when that success callback is called, it will use 'self' which is the 'this' you wanted
[01:26:32] <doug64k> make sense?
[01:26:56] <doug64k> Noor_egy: do you understand closures at all? it seems like that can't work right?
[01:27:02] <doug64k> javascript is not C
[01:27:06] <Noor_egy> umm the self not worked
[01:27:27] <doug64k> not C: variables dont just go away because the function returned
[01:29:47] <Noor_egy> doug64k: self not worked
[01:34:33] <doug64k> Noor_egy: you need .text http://jsfiddle.net/uoLg31ry/3/
[01:34:55] <doug64k> Noor_egy: I hacked it up to make ajax work on jsfiddle
[01:36:43] <Noor_egy> safeFrag = document.createDocumentFragment();
[01:37:57] <Noor_egy> what does this mean safeFrag = document.createDocumentFragment();
[01:38:55] <Cork> Noor_egy: it creates a document fragment
[01:39:09] <Noor_egy> well thats the error i see in the consol
[01:39:12] <Cork> its a way to create a group of dom elements that you later can insert into the page
[01:39:25] <Cork> Noor_egy: what error?
[01:39:34] <Noor_egy>  safeFrag = document.createDocumentFragment();
[01:39:41] <Cork> that isn't an error
[01:39:47] <Cork> its a statement
[01:40:26] <Noor_egy> well it shows in errors
[01:40:45] <Cork> might be, but what you copied is the line that raised an error
[01:40:47] <Cork> not the error
[01:41:13] <Noor_egy> TypeError: document is undefined
[01:41:13] <Noor_egy> http://dems.interchangeworks.com/js/jquery/jquery.min.js
[01:41:13] <Noor_egy> Line 5823
[01:41:22] <Cork> o_O
[01:41:40] <Cork> ok, so you ran this in a situation where document doesn't exist
[01:42:01] <Cork> not sure what situation that would be though
[01:42:23] <doug64k> var document; ???
[01:42:34] <Cork> doubt that
[01:43:14] <doug64k> you never know lol
[01:43:16] <Noor_egy> the page is brough by ajax
[01:43:30] <Cork> Noor_egy: that doesn't matter
[01:43:42] <Cork> Noor_egy: you know what document is right?
[01:43:54] <doug64k> oh! the crash is in jquery. wow
[01:44:05] <Noor_egy> umm
[01:44:05] <Cork> ya, cause the environment is broken
[01:44:35] <Cork> Noor_egy: check so you don't have an extension or something like that in the browser overwriting window.document
[01:45:13] <Noor_egy> if i understand you right i didnt use window.document
[01:45:25] <Noor_egy> in any of my code
[01:45:53] <Cork> Noor_egy: yes you do
[01:46:09] <Cork> jquery heavily depends on it
[01:46:49] <Noor_egy> i dont have window.document in my code
[01:47:07] <Cork> ...
[01:47:22] <Noor_egy> umm
[01:47:22] <Cork> window.document is an object the browser provides
[01:47:30] <Cork> jquery uses it to access the dom
[01:47:40] <Cork> so if you use jqeury to modify the page at all
[01:47:41] <Noor_egy> its in firefox
[01:47:42] <Cork> yes you do
[01:47:56] <Cork> and something is killing document
[01:48:09] <Cork> jquery can't work in a page without document
[01:48:26] <doug64k> chrome wont allow it to get clobbered http://www.jstraight.com/1119/2
[01:50:08] <doug64k> no effect in my ff either
[01:50:48] <Noor_egy> yes i know
[01:51:09] <Noor_egy> ur code worked fine on ff and chrome
[01:51:20] <Noor_egy> umm mine didnt in both
[01:51:21] <Noor_egy> :/
[01:51:31] <doug64k> Noor_egy: no I mean - I can't see how it is possible to hurt window.document
[01:51:54] <Noor_egy> well all the form and button is called by ajax
[01:52:18] <Noor_egy> then when he click the button ajax request fired and backed with the title of the button
[01:53:23] <Noor_egy> the $(self).val(data.label); dont give the error but also not change the value of the button
[01:53:28] <Noor_egy> also the prop code
[01:53:37] <Cork> doug64k: content scripts can't
[01:53:42] <Cork> but extensions can
[01:53:46] <Cork> well at least in firefox
[01:53:50] <doug64k> ah!
[01:54:02] <Cork> that's why i meantioned extensions before
[01:54:20] <doug64k> sorry I auto-corrupted that to "plugin" :D
[01:55:18] <Noor_egy> ummm
[01:56:18] <SDr> hi guys, while doing URL processing, what's the simplest way to take a string (eg "/contacts/123"), and a pattern like "/contacts/:1", and get the match, and  "123" out of it?
[01:56:54] <Jattenalle> parts = url.split('/');
[01:57:00] <Jattenalle> parts[1] is 123
[01:57:04] <Jattenalle> that's the simplest way
[01:58:10] <Cork> regex could do it too
[01:58:53] <Jattenalle> aye, i'm just not very good at regex, and i think split is a simpler solution
[01:59:28] <SDr> 'kay
[02:09:16] <Noor_egy> http://jsfiddle.net/ocam05fx/  doug64k: but the label variable in ajax didnt change
[02:09:27] <Cork> Jattenalle: regex isn't hard for that example
[02:09:45] <Jattenalle> i know Cork, i just rarely use it, and always have to look it up
[02:09:46] <Noor_egy> i try to go arround the code
[02:09:51] <Jattenalle> just one of those things that never stuck
[02:21:32] <hollusion> $('tr td:eq(0)').css('background-color', 'red');
[02:21:43] <hollusion> this only selects the first td in the first tr
[02:21:53] <hollusion> how can i select the first td in all trs
[02:22:01] <hollusion> in each tr
[02:22:06] <Cork> don't use the jquery extended selector
[02:22:10] <Cork> use the css standard one
[02:22:13] <Cork> :first-child
[02:22:21] <Cork> or nth-child
[02:23:18] <hollusion> Cork: $('tr td:nth-child(1)').css('background-color', 'red'); does nothing
[02:23:38] <hollusion> or is it tr:nth-child
[02:23:55] <Cork> no its :first-child or :nth-child(1)
[02:23:58] <Cork> (same thing)
[02:24:14] <Cork> hollusion: that should work, can you make a jsfiddle?
[02:24:32] <Cork> hollusion: also you should thing over using a css class instead
[02:24:47] <Cork> styling should be kept out of js as much as possible
[02:24:52] <hollusion> i want to remove a row from a table
[02:25:07] <hollusion> a complete row
[02:25:27] <Cork> what does remove a row have to do with td?
[02:25:37] <hollusion> sorry
[02:25:40] <hollusion> i meant column
[02:25:45] <Cork> ok
[02:25:51] <Cork> can you make a small demo of the problem?
[02:25:59] <Cork> cause that should work
[02:27:52] <doug64k> hollusion: http://jsfiddle.net/r8g18vr5/
[02:29:18] <hollusion> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/tunhaeee/3/ yeah it works here
[02:29:23] <hollusion> need to check my code
[02:29:28] <hollusion> doug64k: thanks for the fiddle
[02:30:30] <hollusion> Cork: the problem is that i use rowspan http://jsfiddle.net/tunhaeee/4/
[02:30:40] <Cork> oooh :)
[02:30:45] <Cork> ya, that is fun
[02:30:50] <doug64k> lol
[02:30:57] <Cork> been there
[02:32:00] <hollusion> but the cols i want to delete wont have rowspan ... so it should be easy.
[02:33:09] <Cork> hollusion: well if you have colspans on the left of your target you will have to take it into consideration
[02:33:16] <Cork> and that isn't fun -_-'
[02:33:35] <hollusion> i will only have rowspans
[02:33:38] <hollusion> thank god! :)
[02:34:03] <Cork> well as long as the row span starts at the row you target
[02:34:06] <Cork> else it will affect
[02:34:25] <hollusion> ah yes...
[02:34:39] <hollusion> now i get it again. this is foobar
[02:35:50] <hollusion> it is indeed not fun at all. now i have to check if there is rowspan and how long it is and what cols it affects. omg
[02:35:54] <hollusion> there must be a better way
[02:38:09] <hollusion> Cork: yoiu were right, it works good if i use css classes
[02:39:21] <doug64k> hollusion: good interview question
[02:39:56] <hollusion> doug64k: what do you mean?
[02:40:35] <doug64k> hollusion: ask recruits how to delete a table column. then add in colspan and rowspan to see if they collapse - or can implement it
[02:40:35] <Cork> hollusion: for hiring developers :)
[02:41:16] <doug64k> something "easy" that you can make nightmarish is a great interview question :D
[02:41:24] <hollusion> doug64k: you are evil!
[02:41:24] <Cork> lol
[02:41:50] <Cork> doug64k: make the question color this column :)
[02:41:57] <Cork> and "you can only use css" ^^
[02:42:13] <Cork> though that question would be close to impossible to solve
[02:42:42] <doug64k> ya
[02:46:14] <Cork> doug64k: http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/adventuretimewithfinnandjake/images/4/4e/No-no-no-HELL-NO!.gif#hell%20no%20%20gif
[02:46:28] <Cork> i'll bet that becomes the answer
[03:34:44] <mooncup> does anyone have any recommendations of a script for creating bar charts?
[03:39:55] <litropy> mooncup, it's simple enough. Assign a ratio, multiply your values, set the height of your divs according to the results.
[03:40:16] <litropy> The rest is just positioning.
[03:45:05] <hollusion> is there a standard margin for printing html pages?
[03:45:27] <hollusion> im talking about the white space border on the actual printed page
[03:45:46] <hollusion> im trying to make the table as big as possible
[03:48:40] <lcmatt> hollusion: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3503615/what-are-the-minimum-margins-most-printers-can-handle
[03:56:36] <mooncup> litropy: yeah but then I have to make it look good
[03:56:45] <mooncup> I've gone for morris.js, it seems to be pretty nice
[04:04:57] <larsemil> i am using woocommerse+wordpress on a site. I want to run a jquery when a select is changed. It does not work. I think it could be so that woocommerce trigger its function when select is changing. Is there any way to also run my function?
[04:11:52] <sacho> it doesn't work is not a program error
[04:12:12] <Paradisee> why does line 107 return 'undefined'. http://dpaste.com/2Q5QYFG
[04:13:24] <Jattenalle> Paradisee, that's not how JSON works
[04:13:26] <Jattenalle> :/
[04:13:30] <Paradisee> wut
[04:14:07] <Jattenalle> well line 107 is the return value of check_id
[04:14:08] <Paradisee> what's wrong
[04:14:12] <Jattenalle> the return value is null
[04:14:44] <Paradisee> it isn't i checked
[04:16:12] <Jattenalle> sorry, someone else will have to explain it more in-depth, i have to run :/
[04:16:21] <Jattenalle> genuinely sorry, hate to leave you hanging like that..
[04:16:37] <Jattenalle> uhm, Cork, you awake?
[04:17:39] <Jattenalle> oh well, have to run
[04:27:49] <Velveeta> if you're still around, i can explain Paradisee
[04:27:56] <Velveeta> for a couple minutes anyway, then i have ot go also
[04:27:59] <Velveeta> to*
[04:28:15] <Paradisee> y
[04:28:49] <Velveeta> you're not actually returning anything from your check_id function... you're making an ajax request, but not returning anything
[04:29:03] <Velveeta> that's why you're getting undefined in your assignment on 107
[04:30:01] <Paradisee> return RPI_B_plus[counter];
[04:30:11] <Paradisee> that's what im returning
[04:30:27] <Velveeta> right, but that's being returned within the ajax callback, not from the check_id function itself
[04:30:40] <Velveeta> so here's how asynchronous code works, which can take a little bit to wrap your head around sometimes
[04:30:41] <Paradisee> so? what should i do
[04:31:20] <Velveeta> when you make an asynchronous function call, it gets executed in the background, essentially, and checked back on later for completion... in the meantime, the rest of your code continues to execute without the results of that async operation until it's done
[04:31:50] <Paradisee> i know how async works
[04:31:58] <Velveeta> to make this work as you intend, you'll need to do one of 2 different things, and both are gonna require refactoring your code some
[04:32:12] <Cork> Paradisee: the best option is to return what $.ajax gives you and use that in the result from check_id
[04:32:14] <Velveeta> well, apparently you don't know exactly how async works, or else you wouldn't be asking this question
[04:32:29] <Cork> that way you can get close to the behavior you have now without too much change
[04:32:32] <Velveeta> i can write you up an example of 2 different methods for this before i take off
[04:32:32] <Paradisee> Velveeta: i just don't know js
[04:32:49] <Cork> Paradisee: check_id(counter).done(function(json) {})
[04:32:51] <Velveeta> ok, well i'll show you a sample js implementation then, just using a snippet of your code from here
[04:33:25] <Velveeta> yeah, what cork says is one method, which will involve you having to move some of the guts of your check_id function into your droppable config object
[04:33:31] <Velveeta> so you parse the json there instead
[04:33:55] <Cork> well you can return a new $.Callback if you want to preprocess
[04:34:17] <Velveeta> yeah, i would return a new promise of some kind and resolve it with the id
[04:34:44] <Cork> promise is most likely more then needed
[04:35:23] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/0GAHTGZ
[04:35:26] <Paradisee> something like this?
[04:35:58] <Cork> Paradisee: http://jsfiddle.net/4q76gbwp/
[04:36:38] <Cork> might as well write the rest
[04:37:08] <Cork> Paradisee: http://jsfiddle.net/4q76gbwp/1/
[04:37:54] <Paradisee> Cork: i think there's something more easly than this
[04:38:22] <hollusion> jQuery( ":contains(text)" ) is there a variant for :contains-exactly(text) ?
[04:38:23] <Velveeta> this was my example: http://pastebin.com/vXYZCrNz
[04:38:39] <Velveeta> you'll note they're pretty similar, because that's how async processing has to work in this case
[04:39:35] <Velveeta> when you call an async operation, you need to wrap all code that's dependent on that operation within your callback, you can't treat as if it's going to be a synchronous response and just keep writing code to immediately execute after it
[04:40:12] <Omar-> interesting
[04:40:52] <Omar-> anyone has interest in explaining the right usage of "var dfd = $.Deferred();" as in this  http://pastebin.com/vXYZCrNz
[04:41:18] <Omar-> ?api $.Deffered
[04:41:19] <b-ot> Omar-: No matches.
[04:41:21] <Omar-> ?api $.Deffered()
[04:41:23] <Velveeta> i'm creating a new deferred object to return a promise from, and resolving it later
[04:41:23] <b-ot> Omar-: No matches.
[04:41:32] <Velveeta> you're misspelling deferred
[04:41:40] <Omar-> sorry, my bad
[04:41:46] <Omar-> ?api $.Deferred()
[04:41:46] <b-ot> Omar-: No matches.
[04:41:46] <krambiorix> hi, why is the change event not fired? http://jsfiddle.net/8fLbs6r1/1/
[04:42:03] <Velveeta> here you go omar-: http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[04:42:23] <Velveeta> ok, afk for a little bit, i gotta get ready for work
[04:42:29] <Omar-> thanks Velveeta
[04:42:32] <Velveeta> no problemo
[04:43:51] <Omar-> krambiorix change is fired when you click on results
[04:48:20] <krambiorix> Omar, normally, can i select also with arrows and then hitting TAB?
[04:49:13] <Omar-> krambiorix I guess you need to listen to keypress event
[04:52:12] <krambiorix> i thought in jquery 10 it's basic behaviour?
[04:53:58] <Velveeta> i believe for select dropdowns, change only fires on blur when you use the keyboard to change the value
[04:54:05] <Velveeta> that's not a jquery thing, that's a browser thing
[04:54:22] <krambiorix> Velveeta, we're talking about jquery autocomplete
[04:54:34] <krambiorix> i guess i need to add autoFocus: true,
[04:54:54] <Velveeta> ahhh gotcha, that'll teach me to come in halfway through the conversation :D
[04:55:03] <vol4ko_n> Hello Guys
[04:55:49] <vol4ko_n> Instead of making $("someButton").click(function(){}) can i make $("someButton").click(myFunction()) ?
[04:56:07] <Omar-> vol4ko_n $("someButton").click(myFunction)
[04:56:11] <Omar-> without ()
[04:56:26] <vol4ko_n> so myFunction will be defined outside
[04:56:31] <vol4ko_n> ah thanks
[04:56:55] <Omar-> vol4ko_n yes
[04:56:57] <Omar-> welcome
[04:57:42] <vol4ko_n> Omar- and whatif i want to pass values to $("someButton").click(myFunction(someval))
[04:57:44] <vol4ko_n> like that?
[04:57:53] * nodedfree there is an issue with jquery that i cant make an $.each function for array include custom indexes? {"6481":{"name":"foo","family":"bar"}}
[04:57:54] * nodedfree when i do foreah -  value.foo return null
[04:59:36] <Velveeta> value.foo isn't a valid reference... value.name is, and equals 'foo', but value.foo isn't a valid javascript expression given that object
[05:00:27] <Velveeta> vol4ko_n: if you want to pass a value to your callback, you need to use function.bind, or $.proxy or something like that to set up a curried version of that callback
[05:00:56] <Omar-> vol4ko_n I guess in this case you'll need to function () { }); not sure
[05:01:25] <Velveeta> yep, that would work too
[05:02:49] <prohobo> hey, does anyone know of a JS script for providing a user with a list control and allowing them to re-order the contents?
[05:02:56] <prohobo> i dont even know what to call something like that
[05:03:01] <prohobo> re-orderable list?
[05:03:12] <Velveeta> sortable
[05:03:19] <Velveeta> jquery ui comes with one
[05:03:22] <prohobo> ah
[05:03:24] <prohobo> cool ty
[05:03:26] <Velveeta> adios people, time to commute
[05:03:28] <Velveeta> no problemo :)
[05:03:44] <Omar-> or you can make your own using .sort()
[05:06:18] <jarco> Hello, as in understand it .show() is supposed to set display to block right?
[05:06:55] <Omar-> yes jarco
[05:07:06] <Omar-> it adds display: block; to element
[05:07:09] <jarco> I have an element that remains to be display none after i showed it
[05:07:19] <jarco> it just makes opacity 1
[05:07:55] <Omar-> I usually create a custom class with display: none;
[05:08:11] <jarco> But now I am sure it sopposed to fix that so I will look for other redbrick reasons
[05:08:12] <Omar-> and then I use .addClass() / .removeClass() or toggleClass()
[05:08:31] <jarco> Omar-, I will likely to somthing like that
[05:09:40] <Omar-> jarco it's better
[05:09:52] <Omar-> because if you have an element with display: inline in CSS
[05:10:03] <Omar-> and then you add an inline style display: block
[05:10:19] <Omar-> displau: block will override display: inline
[05:10:58] <Omar-> inline styles have priority over CSS
[05:12:32] <jarco> yeah
[05:12:58] <jarco> the problem was that somehow velocity adds opacity 0 and fadein is not making it opacity 1
[05:38:44] <prohobo> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[05:39:21] <Paradisee> how can i iterate over a list in js?
[05:40:06] <Cork> Paradisee: what do you mean by list?
[05:40:12] <Paradisee> lol
[05:40:14] <Paradisee> an array
[05:40:25] <Paradisee> in python its called list
[05:40:30] <Cork> for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {}
[05:40:41] <Cork> or just $.each(arr, function(value) {})
[05:41:00] <Paradisee> ty
[05:48:17] <Paradisee> whats the correct syntax for:
[05:48:20] <prohobo> no
[05:48:22] <Paradisee> var id = $.each(RPI_B_plus, function(value) {
[05:48:40] <Paradisee> if i put a return here, will it be assigned to id?
[06:02:55] <prohobo> Paradisee: i think if you return the value will be overwritten by each subsequent call
[06:03:05] <prohobo> so the last array element will return the value
[06:03:13] <prohobo> IF that even works
[06:03:59] <Aristona> Hi guys, I have a small issue with my .ajax() method
[06:04:06] <Aristona> You can see the snippet here: http://laravel.io/bin/Nry2G
[06:04:42] <Aristona> The issue is, I do "hrow new \Exception("Token expired.") in my backend
[06:04:51] <Aristona> which shows the HTTP Code 400
[06:05:03] <Aristona> however, the script doesn't run .always() method
[06:05:25] <Cork> Aristona: http 400 should trigger .always
[06:05:36] <Cork> does it trigger .fail?
[06:05:44] <Aristona> Let me check
[06:06:21] <Aristona> Maybe I forget to respond jsonp callback?
[06:06:24] <Aristona> Can it be the issue?
[06:06:36] <Cork> ah
[06:06:42] <Cork> jsonp is not ajax
[06:06:47] <Cork> it might not trigger those
[06:06:50] <Cork> not sure there
[06:07:20] <Cork> Aristona: jsonp is <script src="path-to-jsonp-script"></script>
[06:07:34] <Cork> and not sure if that has error handling
[06:09:12] <Aristona> I'm trying the following now
[06:09:22] <Aristona> return $klein->response()->json(['message' => $e->getMessage()], $klein->request()->param('callback'));
[06:09:36] <Aristona> and added console.logs on both methods
[06:11:13] <beasty> aww it's armageddon inhere
[06:13:38] <Aristona> Nope, fail and always doesn't run at all
[06:14:46] <sacho> that's not a jsonp response
[06:15:28] <Aristona> hmm
[06:15:33] <Aristona> I'll dig it then
[06:16:59] <sacho> it has to be some javascript, usually a function call passing an object literal as a parameter
[06:22:09] <Aristona> The thing is, when I browse http://limkrelated.dev/api/v1/article/click manually and let it throw an exception
[06:22:20] <Aristona> I get response type application/json
[06:22:34] <Aristona> When someone clicks on the widget, response is text/javascript
[06:24:51] <Cork> Aristona: json != jsonp
[06:24:59] <Cork> its a very big difference between the two
[06:26:31] <Aristona> Yes, I respond the jsonp callback
[06:26:35] <Aristona> in my backend
[06:26:52] <Aristona> $klein->response()->json(['message' => $e->getMessage()], $klein->request()->param('callback'));
[06:27:07] <Aristona> It wraps the json response in jsonp callback
[06:27:14] <Aristona> but for some reason it returns text/javascript
[06:27:41] <Cork> Aristona: it isn't for some reason
[06:27:47] <Cork> it is cause jsonp IS javascript
[06:27:55] <Cork> its just javascript with data in it
[06:28:37] <Cork> jsonp is a hack around cross domain calls
[06:28:59] <Cork> it uses the fact that javascript isn't blocked by the same cross domain calls that ajax call is
[06:29:04] <Cork> *calls are
[06:29:22] <Cork> so it uses the <script> tag to pull a javascript and execute it
[06:29:30] <Cork> this calls a function defined in the page
[06:29:33] <Cork> and you have your data
[06:29:46] <Cork> its is VERY different from how ajax json works
[06:30:32] <Aristona> Mate, right now I do the following
[06:30:41] <Aristona> Do you know about backend? Mostly PHP?
[06:30:55] <Aristona> I'm probably overlooking something
[06:31:08] <Cork> i know pleny of backend languages
[06:31:21] <Cork> but that doens't really matter
[06:31:32] <Cork> jsonp by definition is javascript
[06:31:46] <Cork> so normal ajax rules don't apply
[06:31:53] <Cork> that is what i'm trying to tell you
[06:32:03] <Zetita> Hi All! I'm getting a VERY strange bug with a textarea, anyone with time to discuss?
[06:32:14] <Cork> ?ask @ Zetita
[06:32:14] <b-ot> Zetita: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:32:25] <Zetita> Thanks guys
[06:32:28] <Aristona> Cork: http://laravel.io/bin/EdJPE
[06:32:51] <Aristona> Basically, I attempt to remove a Token in my Redis database (which has 1 min EXPIRE)
[06:33:07] <Cork> ...
[06:33:13] <Cork> are you using jsonp or not?
[06:33:21] <Zetita> The font size and style is changing in my textboxes when data is retrieved from DB. If not, the font are ok
[06:33:35] <Zetita> textarea, sorry
[06:33:53] <Cork> Zetita: font on the textarea shouldn't change cause of setting value on the field
[06:34:04] <Zetita> i know, it's crazy
[06:34:14] <Aristona> Mate, I'm looking at the Klein's documentation
[06:34:14] <Cork> Zetita: can you reproduce it in a testcase?
[06:34:16] <Aristona> json($object, $jsonp_prefix = null)             // Send an object as JSON or JSONP by providing padding prefix
[06:34:37] <Aristona> and the second parameter, which is $req->param('callback'), is the jsonp
[06:34:47] <Cork> ok, so you send jsonp
[06:34:51] <Cork> and you get javascript
[06:34:53] <Cork> as expected
[06:35:04] <Aristona> And, it doesn't run the .fail or .always methods
[06:35:10] <Cork> yes cause it isn't ajax
[06:35:18] <Cork> like i've said endles number of times now
[06:35:24] <Cork> jsonp is not json or ajax
[06:35:36] <Cork> it is a javascript resource loaded in a <script> tag
[06:35:42] <Zetita> the javascript it's different font when I have data, than when the textarea is empty
[06:35:55] <Cork> ?paste
[06:35:56] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:36:00] <Aristona> The reason I use jsonp is to make cross domain calls
[06:36:02] <Cork> Zetita: try make a demo in there ^
[06:36:09] <Zetita> indeed, if the textarea is empty and I write something, the font is ok
[06:36:11] <Aristona> What should I do instead?
[06:36:23] <Cork> Aristona: you would have to stop depending on .fail
[06:36:35] <Cork> cause <script> doesn't reliably provide that
[06:37:01] <Aristona> Could you give me a small example?
[06:37:26] <Cork> sending a status error in the jsonp response instead of throwing?
[06:37:28] <Aristona> This thing works properly when I'm on the same domain (e.g my local computer)
[06:37:40] <Cork> yes cause then you have ajax not jsonp
[06:38:18] <Aristona> I throw the exception, catch it, prepare response headers and respond in json format with second parameter being the jsonp callback
[06:38:31] <Aristona> but since .fail doesn't run as you said
[06:38:35] <Cork> and jsonp can only handle 200 responses
[06:38:40] <Aristona> how can I refactor that snippet?
[06:38:43] <Cork> so you have to always return 200
[06:38:46] <Aristona> if header !== 200
[06:38:51] <Aristona> it is a failed call
[06:38:53] <Cork> the script won't load
[06:38:54] <Aristona> and execute something
[06:39:00] <Cork> and jsonp can't handle that
[06:39:35] <Cork> Aristona: you seam unwilling to understand that jsonp is a hack
[06:39:47] <Cork> and not as fullfeatured as ajax is
[06:40:08] <Aristona> But ajax isn't crossdomain so we rely on jsonp?
[06:40:11] <Aristona> or am I mistaken?
[06:40:13] <Cork> ajax can be
[06:40:21] <Cork> but only in browsers that support cors
[06:40:29] <Cork> ?mdn cors
[06:40:30] <b-ot> Cork: CORs - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[06:40:37] <Aristona> Basically, what I'm trying to achieve is, once an article is clicked, it calls our API server
[06:40:46] <Aristona> API server checks the token, and responds accordingly
[06:40:59] <Cork> Aristona: i've told this as many times as i'm going to; this is the last time
[06:41:09] <Cork> always return 200 if you want jsonp, you don't have an option
[06:41:14] <Cork> or you have to use something else
[06:41:17] <Cork> like cors
[06:41:24] <Aristona> Oh wait
[06:41:24] <Cork> but then you can't support older ie browsers
[06:41:35] <Aristona> so I return 200, and provide a header message or something?
[06:41:49] <Cork> you have to put the error in the json object
[06:42:10] <Cork> { error: { message: msg, code: 400 } }
[06:42:15] <Aristona> So basically, if(response.hasError === true) ?
[06:42:25] <Cork> for example ya
[06:42:30] <Aristona> oh
[06:43:21] <Cork> Aristona: but basically cors isn't an option if you need to support ie < 10
[06:43:31] <Cork> your choice
[06:43:46] <Aristona> What do you use for ie<10?
[06:43:57] <Cork> ie older then 10
[06:44:06] <Cork> or rather lower then 10
[06:44:22] <Aristona> So they cannot make crossdomain requests?
[06:44:42] <Cork> you need to fiddle with XDomainRequest
[06:44:47] <Cork> and it is a hole in the head
[06:44:51] <Cork> you don't want to do that
[06:45:04] <Cork> cause it is a GIGANTIC pain
[06:45:12] <Cork> way worse then jsonp
[06:45:15] <Aristona> jQuery doesn't provide any helper methods on top for that?
[06:45:27] <Cork> the problem isn't client side
[06:45:33] <Cork> there are plugins for that end
[06:45:43] <Cork> but the server needs to have special code to handle XDomainRequest
[06:46:01] <Cork> cause normal request parsing is intentionally broken is XDomainRequest
[06:46:38] <Aristona> i'll note that
[06:48:14] <Aristona> thanks alot for the help mate

[07:41:45] <garethdaine> Guys, I have this http://laravel.io/bin/9b5k1
[07:42:03] <garethdaine> Now it works great the first time but then if I click again it reloads the page
[07:42:16] <abailarri> Hello. Anyone can help me with this question? http://jsfiddle.net/h87qr7t7/
[07:45:17] <decx> use prepend abailarri
[07:53:59] <dmsuperman> garethdaine: I don't see anything here that would reload the page, I don't think that's your issue
[07:54:32] <dmsuperman> garethdaine: my guess is that the link you are attaching this to is losing its event handler
[07:54:52] <garethdaine> Hmmm, didn’t think so. It’s not a link, just a button element
[07:55:03] <dmsuperman> link/button
[07:55:14] <dmsuperman> if you click a button with no form or event handler, I believe it reloads the page
[07:55:18] <dmsuperman> or submits an empty form to the current URL
[07:55:27] <dmsuperman> use the network tab, is it a post on the page load?
[07:55:31] <dmsuperman> after clicking the button
[07:55:35] <vol4ko_n> Thank you decx
[07:56:46] <garethdaine> It’s a post initially (that works) it’s then a post again but reloads
[07:56:52] <garethdaine> This is teh HTML http://laravel.io/bin/48waN
[07:58:17] <garethdaine> First post goes to /admin/quizzes/1/switch second goes to /admin/quizzes/1
[07:58:34] <garethdaine> So, the click event is being lost after initial click
[07:58:50] <Velveeta> just to throw this out there, there's no default 'type' on button elements.. you should specify to the browser what type that is, as some may default it to 'submit' and others to 'button', etc
[07:58:55] <dmsuperman> are you replacing the make-answer button in your ajax request garethdaine?
[07:58:58] <rockyrock> is .append() asynchronous guys?
[07:59:04] <Velveeta> append is synchronous
[07:59:17] <dmsuperman> doesn't matter if he's capturing the event for JS purposes Velveeta
[07:59:30] <dmsuperman> and preventing default
[07:59:30] <Velveeta> i know that, i was just throwing it out there as a best practice
[07:59:43] <garethdaine> Changed it to $(document).on(‘click’ and it works now http://laravel.io/bin/Jdq6W
[07:59:50] <Velveeta> if his js fails for whatever reason, it could make the difference between a form post submit and just a button click that does nothing
[07:59:59] <dmsuperman> garethdaine: so I'm guessing you were replacing the button yeah?
[08:00:08] <dmsuperman> that's exactly right if so
[08:00:44] <dmsuperman> Velveeta: I suppose, if he took the time to make the page work without JS, it would matter
[08:00:52] <dmsuperman> if the page breaks without JS though I don't see how it matters
[08:00:55] <garethdaine> No, the button should stay the same, it’s using a partial view, so the initial screen loads the partial, then when you click a button it gets the partial again via ajax (after the backend code changes the db etc)
[08:01:20] <dmsuperman> garethdaine: which is the partial though?
[08:01:31] <dmsuperman> if you aren't replacing the button I don't see any code that should be killing the event handler
[08:01:33] <garethdaine> http://laravel.io/bin/48waN
[08:01:42] <dmsuperman> I see the button right there
[08:01:43] <dmsuperman> :P
[08:01:47] <Velveeta> if it breaks without js, it doesn't matter.. like i said, i was throwing it out there as a best practice, because some people may assume a <button> tag with no type attribute will always default to a 'submit' or a 'button' type, but there that's up to the browser to interpret for itself, so you may get inconsistent behavior if you don't specify it yourself
[08:02:06] <dmsuperman> Well... thanks for that I guess Velveeta :P I just don't think it really applies
[08:02:15] <dmsuperman> since this seems to rely on JS working
[08:02:31] <Velveeta> you seem to be missing the point, since i wasn't throwing that out there as anything to solve his problem
[08:02:48] <garethdaine> So there’s multiple buttons, once you change the answer it replaces the button with a check and the other answers still have buttons
[08:02:57] <Velveeta> it would be like someone saying "you should use semicolons for clarity" even if code executes fine without them due to ASI
[08:03:10] <Velveeta> even if it's not the problem it's a best practice that should be followed
[08:03:35] <dmsuperman> I disagree
[08:03:42] <Velveeta> if it's replacing the button, unless you're using event delegation, that would be why you're losing your handler
[08:03:48] <dmsuperman> specifying the type when you intend to use the button as a button, that's best practice
[08:03:51] <dmsuperman> you shouldn't leave it up to defaults
[08:03:53] <dmsuperman> I agree there
[08:04:02] <dmsuperman> but if you aren't using it as a button, it doesn't matter. there's no best practice
[08:04:08] <dmsuperman> because you aren't using the browser behavior regardless
[08:04:39] <dmsuperman> garethdaine: so it only replaces the one question you submit, not all of them?
[08:04:47] <Velveeta> well, you can feel free to disagree, but that doesn't change the practice... best practices are so because they apply generally.. you don't usually say "best practice is *this* unless you're doing *that*"
[08:04:59] <dmsuperman> best practices have context
[08:05:08] <dmsuperman> you can say it's best practice but that doesn't make it universally so
[08:05:16] <dmsuperman> you can turn this into a petulant argument as well if you want
[08:05:18] <dmsuperman> I'm going for coffee
[08:05:48] <garethdaine> dmsuperman: Yeah, it’s actually on the answers to the question, but yeah, it only replaces the one button on the answer with a tick
[08:06:23] <dmsuperman> garethdaine: I'd suggest there's something else afoot then. if you aren't replacing or regenerating the button in any way, there's no reason the event handler should fall off
[08:06:30] <dmsuperman> I'd investigate the network tab and be sure you're only getting the one answer back
[08:07:38] <garethdaine> The codes being run inside a $(document).ready function, perhaps that’s why it’s only working once/ I’m not experienced enough to know
[08:07:48] <Velveeta> you said "So there’s multiple buttons, once you change the answer it replaces the button with a check and the other answers still have buttons" right?
[08:07:51] <garethdaine> If I use $(document).on it works
[08:08:07] <dmsuperman> the document.ready shouldn't matter
[08:08:09] <Velveeta> so if you're binding these at document ready time, and then replacing with a checkbox, that would be where you're losing your event listener
[08:08:23] <dmsuperman> the fact that using event delegation binding fixes your issue suggests to me that the buttons are getting replaced
[08:08:26] <uskerine> if console.log(this) is     <input id="check2" type="checkbox" value="check2" name="check2">    and  console.log(this.checked)     is  true,   why console.log($('#check2').checked)    is undefined?
[08:08:46] <dmsuperman> uskerine: .prop('checked')?
[08:09:14] <dmsuperman> or this isn't $('#check2')
[08:09:25] <dmsuperman> (ie maybe you illegaly have 2 elements with the same name?)
[08:09:33] <uskerine> ok, byt why?
[08:09:38] <dmsuperman> what does $('*[id=check2]').length say
[08:09:58] <uskerine> doing what you say, it works, but why you can use checked with this and not with $('#check2')
[08:09:59] <uskerine> ?
[08:11:17] <garethdaine> Velveeta: PHP outputs a table of questions and their corresponding answers, each question has a correct answer. The incorrect answers have a ‘Make Answer’ button, when you click it AJAX runs the URL /admin/quizzes/{id}/switch and sends questionId and answerId as query parameters via data in the request. Then a PHP function changes the correct answer in the database and returns a view partial (the one pasted above), in the PHP fo
[08:11:18] <garethdaine> the partial there’s an if statement checking which answers are correct, if it’s correct it outputs a tick icon and if it isn’t it outputs a ‘Make Answer’ button with the class .make-answer and the data attributes required to then make that answer the correct one when pressing the button.
[08:11:20] <dmsuperman> what does that expression I gave say uskerine
[08:11:36] <dmsuperman> just run it in your console
[08:12:15] <uskerine> there is only one check2 item, it returns 1 dmsuperman
[08:12:38] <dmsuperman> I'm not sure, would need more context
[08:12:48] <dmsuperman> $(aCheckbox).checked works fine on my end
[08:12:54] <uskerine> weird
[08:12:55] <Velveeta> garethdaine: if you're injecting button content you're getting back from an ajax request, and you're binding up those event listeners on document ready, you're not binding to the new buttons
[08:13:10] <uskerine> in my case it does not work, but it works with .prop('checked') as you suggested
[08:13:12] <Velveeta> that's why, like dm said, delegation works.. but not your direct binding
[08:13:17] <garethdaine> Velveeta: That’s what I thought
[08:13:26] <dmsuperman> garethdaine: ah, you're replacing all of the questions at once based on the new state
[08:13:32] <garethdaine> Yes
[08:13:33] <dmsuperman> I thought the partial was only a single answer
[08:13:40] <garethdaine> No, the whole HTML
[08:13:46] <dmsuperman> alrighty. then you have the right solution
[08:13:48] <dmsuperman> sorry for the goose chase
[08:14:00] <garethdaine> It’s OK, it’s good to fully understand what’s going on
[08:14:05] <garethdaine> Thanks for the pointers

[08:24:44] <garethdaine> I’ve done bits and bobs but generally always fall back. Need to get in to the habit

[08:42:27] <OnkelTem> Hi
[08:42:49] <OnkelTem> Please, can you help, that is wrong with this: jQuery('input[name="price_arr[]"]').each(function(i, el) { console.log($(el).val()); })?
[08:42:58] <OnkelTem>  Uncaught
[08:43:00] <OnkelTem> TypeError: undefined is not a function
[08:43:04] <OnkelTem> This is what Chrome prints
[08:44:22] <OnkelTem> what*
[08:45:17] <OnkelTem> I just don't get. When I print elements - they all printed ok. But when I add this .val() - it doens't work
[08:46:27] <BillCriswell> OnkelTem: Are you running onConflict? Seems weird to use jQuery and $.
[08:46:36] <OnkelTem> omg
[08:46:38] <OnkelTem> I stupid
[08:46:59] <OnkelTem> BillCriswell: thanks! This is from old joomla administration pages, and $ is bound to something else
[08:47:07] <BillCriswell> OnkelTem: Sweeeeeet
[08:47:13] <OnkelTem> so I used jQuery, but automatically typed $ for the second expr
[08:47:33] <BillCriswell> Should wrap that up in an IIFE or something.
[08:47:52] <BillCriswell> (function($){ /* Use $ in here all you want */ }(jQuery));
[08:47:58] <robertmaxrees> beat me to it ;)
[08:48:42] <Omar-> what's IIFE? anonymous function?
[08:48:56] <robertmaxrees> Immediately Invoked Function Expression
[08:49:09] <Omar-> right right, I read about once hahah
[08:49:12] <Omar-> thanks robertmaxrees
[08:49:26] <robertmaxrees> some people call those self executing anonymous functions, but that term isn't really accurate. ben alman wrote a fantastic article about it a while ago.
[08:50:09] <Omar-> I read that article before, but I couldn't understand 75% of it since i'm not into JS
[08:50:19] <Omar-> but it's defintely helpful
[08:50:32] <robertmaxrees> all you need to know is it gives you a one-time use execution context.
[08:50:43] <Omar-> bit by bit i'm diving in JS ocean
[08:51:16] <Omar-> robertmaxrees yea, I use $(function () {}); to execute enhancement method in jQM
[08:51:23] <robertmaxrees> that's not the same thing.
[08:51:27] <Omar-> yea?
[08:51:35] <robertmaxrees> that's the same as $(document).ready(function(){});
[08:52:12] <Omar-> and (function ($) {}(jQuery)); is different? IIFE?
[08:52:24] <robertmaxrees> yeah - that doesn't wait for document ready.
[08:52:27] <robertmaxrees> that just runs the code.
[08:52:30] <Omar-> ahhhh
[08:52:58] <Omar-> wonderful!
[08:53:09] <Omar-> I've learn something new
[08:53:13] <Omar-> thanks robertmaxrees
[08:53:14] <robertmaxrees> that also lets you use $ instead of jQuery if you're in noconflict mode.
[08:53:38] <Omar-> but I can jQ inside IIFE because jQ is loaded but before ready is triggered
[08:53:39] <Omar-> right?
[08:53:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[08:54:10] <Velveeta_> right
[08:54:16] <Omar-> ok, i'll rephrase myself
[08:54:19] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah.
[08:54:23] <Velveeta_> i think he's asking if he can use jquery inside his iife, before document ready
[08:54:33] <robertmaxrees> you can use jquery in an iife as long as you incluide jquery before your code
[08:54:33] <Omar-> inside (function($) { jquery code }(jQuery)); is possible?
[08:54:51] <Omar-> of course when jQ is loaded
[08:54:53] <Velveeta_> yepyep, as long as it's loaded
[08:55:13] <Omar-> Velveeta_ gracias
[08:55:17] <Velveeta_> de nada
[08:55:24] <Omar-> de donde eres?
[08:55:30] <Velveeta_> austin tejas
[08:55:40] <Omar-> robertmaxrees thanks mate :)
[08:55:45] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[08:56:09] <Omar-> Velveeta_ muy bien
[08:56:26] <Omar-> yo de Palestina pero vivo en Espana
[08:57:00] <Velveeta> god i hate this meeting room, the wifi is so flaky in this section of the building..
[08:57:46] <robertmaxrees> we just upgraded our entire wifi infrastructure and still have issues in some rooms.  you'll have full signal but you keep getting handed off between two APs.  really frustrating.
[08:57:58] <Velveeta> yeah i hate that
[08:58:19] <robertmaxrees> i sit near IT though, and the wifi over here is great when i'm on it hahaha
[08:58:35] <Velveeta> heheheheh
[09:08:51] <PhanLord> is there an event in jquerygrid that would be invokved in grid needs to grab more data for virtual/infinit scroll ?
[09:09:30] <PhanLord> i have my own function that creates URL and grabs data so cant use URL attribute of jqgrid
[09:14:17] <bradfordli123> How would you make a li selectable to be pushed onto an array? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26512124/selecting-li-to-be-added-to-an-array
[09:15:12] <robertmaxrees> by using checkboxes instead.
[09:15:21] <robertmaxrees> or using checkboxes inside your <li>s
[09:17:09] <robertmaxrees> bradfordli123 have you considered running through a tutorial of some kind?
[09:17:28] <bradfordli123> robertmaxrees: i considered checkboxes but theyre too small
[09:17:33] <dmsuperman> use CSS
[09:17:37] <dmsuperman> to make them look however you like
[09:17:52] <robertmaxrees> bradfordli123 you can highlight your selections much easier and maintain state much easier with them.
[09:17:59] <dmsuperman> http://cssdeck.com/labs/css-checkbox-styles
[09:18:14] <bradfordli123> dmsuperman: edit check boxes with CSS! good idea!
[09:37:05] <skypce> hello again
[09:38:10] <skypce> i have made a jfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/vpzwLo5c/1/  i need that href of a link change to category-carpets only and not category-carpets-children? i have many divs i can do it with attr but a universal solution will be great :) thanks
[09:39:35] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:39:47] <robertmaxrees> mind clarifying your question?  what are you trying to edit?
[09:40:54] <skypce> sure robertmaxrees
[09:41:10] <sweet2k4> I have a plugin that uses the href in a <a> tag as identifier, like this <a href="#popupModal"></a>. would be considerd bad to put a href inside a div element like this <div href="#popupModal">. in jquery these are linked to onclick events
[09:41:56] <skypce> i want pass the href of parent href link
[09:41:59] <skypce> let me show a example
[09:42:09] <robertmaxrees> skypce you can't nest links...
[09:42:19] <skypce> i have this website
[09:42:20] <skypce> https://maryam-montague-nkft.squarespace.com/home-decor/
[09:42:21] <robertmaxrees> sweet2k4 hrefs can only go on <a> tags.
[09:42:58] <sweet2k4> robertmaxrees: yes, but if i put href in the div, the popupmodal does work
[09:43:07] <skypce> give me a minute robertmaxrees
[09:43:09] <sweet2k4> robertmaxrees: but would it validate?
[09:43:26] <robertmaxrees> sweet2k4 iirc, no.  you cann use hrefs on divs.
[09:43:34] <robertmaxrees> *cannot
[09:43:42] <robertmaxrees> you can only use the href attribute on <a>
[09:44:07] <sweet2k4> robertmaxrees: hmm ok,
[09:44:40] <skypce> robertmaxrees, https://maryam-montague-nkft.squarespace.com/carpets-index-new/vintage-moroccan-beni-ourain-rug-1
[09:44:45] <skypce> i need that back link
[09:44:48] <skypce> point only to
[09:45:10] <skypce> http://www.mmontague.com/carpets
[09:45:18] <skypce> it is working fine
[09:45:25] <skypce> but are many categories
[09:46:21] <yaro_> Hi guys, I am a little bit confused with ajax and jquery, should I use success or done methods?
[09:46:29] <robertmaxrees> done
[09:46:40] <yaro_> I have used success: so far but it seems that it is deprecated
[09:47:22] <neruda_> having a little jquery bootstrap trouble: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26510222/jquery-dynamic-bootstrap-tabs-with-simple-form-haml
[09:47:24] <neruda_> any help appreciated
[09:47:57] <robertmaxrees> skypce could you make a test case?
[09:48:02] <Omar-> yano use .done() or .then()
[09:48:16] <yano> hm?
[09:48:47] <Omar-> sorry yano
[09:48:51] <yano> no worries :)
[09:48:54] <Omar-> yaro_ use .done() or .then()
[09:49:01] <Omar-> =D
[09:49:26] <yaro_> what is the difference between .done and success method
[09:49:27] <yaro_> ?
[09:51:23] <Korvin> I'm trying to find out what event binding is preventing me from focusing an input
[09:51:51] <Korvin> running $(document).unbind() makes it so that I can focus the input, so I assume that means the event stopping it is on document
[09:52:08] <Korvin> is there any way I can see what IS bound and unbind one at a time to find the event?
[09:52:59] <skypce> thank you robertmaxrees i will do it in old way
[09:54:54] <robertmaxrees> skypce errr, okay.
[10:00:26] <csd_> My site is returning JSON of {"actionid": 30} , and I have an ifstatement of if (data && data.actionid) , where which is returning false. I'm inexperienced working ajax/json, so I'm not sure what small mistake i'm making
[10:00:54] <robertmaxrees> do a console.log(data) and make sure that works, first.
[10:01:36] <csd_> yes that works
[10:02:13] <robertmaxrees> then do a console.log(data.actionid) - that works?
[10:02:30] <robertmaxrees> if so, mind showing your code?
[10:02:55] <csd_> no that's undefined
[10:03:31] <csd_> the quotes need to be around the name right?
[10:03:51] <robertmaxrees> then your data isn't what you think it is.  could you share it in a fixee or something?  also, showing your Ajax code would be helpful too.
[10:04:26] <csd_> ill put it in a pastebin
[10:04:27] <csd_> one sec
[10:07:06] <csd_> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/DZgL8Qtu
[10:08:35] <robertmaxrees> do  console.log(JSON.stringify(data)); and share the data.
[10:09:24] <csd_> "{\"actionid\": 34}"
[10:10:48] <robertmaxrees> those backslashes look suspicious to me.  try console.log(typeof data); - what do you get?
[10:11:32] <csd_> i know what they're from. i was escaping the quotes in clojure. i'm surprised to see them
[10:12:11] <csd_> says data type is string
[10:12:15] <robertmaxrees> that's the problem.
[10:12:46] <csd_> hrm
[10:12:56] <csd_> i dont suppose you write in clojure do you
[10:13:00] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:13:24] <robertmaxrees> return it from your backend without any quotes outside of the entire object.
[10:13:31] <robertmaxrees> quotes arouind the name are fine.
[10:13:47] <csd_> clojure complains about quotes inside strings, so i had to escape them
[10:13:59] <csd_> hence the problem here.. i need to find a new way to write the string
[10:14:06] <robertmaxrees> *JSON
[10:14:07] <robertmaxrees> not a string.
[10:14:13] <robertmaxrees> find a lib that'll output JSON for you.
[10:14:35] <csd_> yeah i just did that manually since it isnt that much data
[10:15:05] <robertmaxrees> then look up how to properly output JSON
[10:15:43] <Omar-> bbl
[10:16:14] <csd_> ok thanks for helping me with this
[10:16:27] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[10:22:45] <sweet2k4> im trying to open a popup with when i click a div. not a <a> tag. but i cant figure out how to do it. here is the docs http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/documentation.html#inline_type
[10:25:05] <sweet2k4> it should be fairly simple... but..
[10:25:35] <dev_12> hello there
[10:26:26] <robertmaxrees> sweet2k4 you have to manually bind your own listener on that element and then run $.magnificPopup.open({}) - dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/documentation.html#public_methods
[10:27:17] <sweet2k4> robertmaxrees: alright, thanks il look it up
[10:33:14] <sweet2k4> robertmaxrees: something like this?, http://www.codeshare.io/6o5FL but there is some error: missing ) after formal parameters
[10:35:06] <robertmaxrees> $('open').on('click', function ($.magnificPopup.open({ should be $('open').on('click', function () {$.magnificPopup.open({
[10:36:03] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/56vwcy6/
[10:36:16] <robertmaxrees> also needed to change that last line to });
[10:37:14] <sweet2k4> robertmaxrees: okey, i see, thanks for helping il try the code you posted
[10:37:56] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: you're a machine
[10:38:08] <robertmaxrees> i'm doing work on top of all this, too ;)
[10:38:55] <sweet2k4> indeed a machine! :-)
[10:39:59] <dev_12> need a little help here
[10:41:17] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ dev_12
[10:41:17] <b-ot> dev_12: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:52:59] <Paradisee> how can i check if an element is inside an array?
[10:53:09] <robertmaxrees> a jquery object or an array?
[10:53:13] <Paradisee> array
[10:53:29] <Paradisee> a = [1,2,3,4]
[10:54:21] <dev_12> i've accordion on right hand side here http://www.imagefix.co.uk/hypo_demo/schools-and-public-buildings/ it currently overlay the div below, i don't want it, how do i solve it? applying margin to bottom div on click ?
[10:55:05] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee if you only need ie9 and above, myArray.some(function(element) { return element === 3 });
[10:55:49] <Paradisee> i dont care about ie, for me can die
[10:55:59] <rpag> IE r0x!
[10:56:02] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee then you're ignoring a huge segment of the internet ;) but fair enough.
[10:56:06] <robertmaxrees> dev_12 what do you want it to do instead?
[10:56:33] <Paradisee> other suggestion?
[10:56:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:57:08] <Paradisee> will it work with the other browsers?
[10:57:22] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some
[10:57:28] <robertmaxrees> check out the compatibility table.
[10:59:09] <dev_12> robertmaxress i want the accordion to not overlay the div below instead create enough space? may be?
[10:59:13] <robertmaxrees> dev_12 check in #css - they should be able to help you over there.
[10:59:53] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/0V1XPW2
[10:59:55] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: ^
[11:01:00] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[11:01:08] <robertmaxrees> why are you using a for loop?
[11:01:21] <Paradisee> cus i need it for my application
[11:01:24] <robertmaxrees> wat
[11:01:30] <robertmaxrees> you asked how to test if something is in an array
[11:01:59] <Paradisee> yes but i this is what should i do with it
[11:02:16] <robertmaxrees> huh?  something isn't making sense here, but OK...
[11:02:52] <Paradisee> where will be stored the returned value?
[11:03:09] <robertmaxrees> this is not a good solution for that
[11:03:39] <Paradisee> i can explain you what i need to do
[11:04:03] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/386BPS9
[11:04:09] <Paradisee> this is the whole code btw
[11:05:25] <Paradisee> the problem is, that when i add an element in the json, and i refresh the page, and add again another element, it will be overrided by the last item inserted
[11:05:32] <sweet2k4> robertmaxrees: i dont want to overflow you with questions, but i still dot get it to work. the code you posted does not bring up the  popup, but i got it to work at codepen: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/jkqnD
[11:05:43] <Paradisee> so i have to find a way to avoid this problem
[11:05:50] <sweet2k4> robertmaxrees: but if i put that code inside my site it does not work...
[11:06:20] <robertmaxrees> sweet2k4 no clue mano.
[11:06:51] <lintguy> I'm using Isotope to filter elements on a page, but the classes to filter on are on the child div and not on the parent li. I can't figure out how to solve it, i thought of moving all classes to the parent div but it was incredibly slow. The system don't allow me to change the parent li's.
[11:06:54] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee still lost about what you're doing.
[11:07:14] <sweet2k4> robertmaxrees: ok, would it be wrong to post this directly into a javascript file: $('#open').magnificPopup({   items: {       src: '#test-popup',       type: 'inline'   } });
[11:07:19] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: do you have team viewer? it makes the things easier
[11:07:33] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee i don't like using things like teamviewer.
[11:07:40] <robertmaxrees> we ask for reduced test cases for a reason ;)
[11:07:50] <robertmaxrees> sweet2k4 that assumes that those selectors match your content.
[11:08:03] <Paradisee> is it right?
[11:08:03] <Paradisee>                     var id = RPI_B_plus.some(function(pin) {
[11:08:04] <Paradisee>                         return pin === i
[11:08:04] <Paradisee>                     });
[11:08:12] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee please do not past multiple lines into the channel.
[11:08:43] <Paradisee> do i have to make a no-paste with that code again now?
[11:08:53] <robertmaxrees> and no - declaring vars inside of a loop isn't a very good idea.
[11:09:17] <sweet2k4> robertmaxrees: yes, it does.. hm strange stuff
[11:12:30] <sweet2k4> robertmaxrees:okey! nice got it to work, i accedently put a # in the div id. workes now, thnaks a lot for helping me sorting it out! your the man! ;)
[11:12:49] <robertmaxrees> there you go.  it's always simpler than you think.
[11:13:24] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: http://dpaste.com/1WDFSC3  if the value is inside the array, then i have to store it in a var a break the lopp, how can i do that?
[11:13:55] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple google search will show you how ;)
[11:14:19] <Paradisee> i hate js, so ugly
[11:14:26] <robertmaxrees> it's actually not that bad.
[11:14:31] <Paradisee> it is
[11:14:48] <robertmaxrees> it's a lot easier if you use a more functional paradigm and clean data structures.
[11:15:15] <Paradisee> im a python programmer, other languages are so implicit
[11:15:33] <robertmaxrees> i started in python.
[11:15:40] <Paradisee> btw, RPI_B_plus.some(function(pin)
[11:15:41] <BillCriswell> Paradisee: I think you just need indexOf().
[11:15:43] <robertmaxrees> you can't treat JS like Python at all.  totally different languages.
[11:15:47] <Paradisee> returns true/false
[11:16:00] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee i'm well aware of it does
[11:16:04] <robertmaxrees> *what it does
[11:16:07] <robertmaxrees> indexOf() could work, too.
[11:16:11] <Paradisee> gotta store the var now
[11:16:18] <robertmaxrees> but your whole exercize seems really bizarre.
[11:16:24] <Paradisee> exercize?
[11:16:33] <BillCriswell> This code is nuts.
[11:16:36] <robertmaxrees> what you're tyring to do sounds really strange.
[11:16:38] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[11:16:46] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: it doesnt
[11:16:57] <robertmaxrees> rather, the way you're trying to do it.
[11:16:59] <robertmaxrees> but meh.
[11:17:08] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: do you have a better suggestion about?
[11:17:37] <Paradisee> ill explain you very easly what i need to do:
[11:18:11] <Paradisee> when i drag and drop an element inside a div, it will be stored inside a json file, with an id that is inside an array
[11:18:28] <Paradisee> so if keep adding items, they will be stored in the json without problem
[11:18:37] <robertmaxrees> there's your problem.  why are you storing that info in an array?
[11:18:41] <robertmaxrees> it should go into your JSON.
[11:18:58] <Paradisee> but if i refresh the page, and add another item, the last item i dropped will overwrite the first one
[11:19:23] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: no sense to store a simple array in the json and make an ajax call
[11:19:26] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're running logic on pageload that you shouldn't be, as well.
[11:19:57] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee you should store those IDs inside your json - why are you storing info about an object across two different structures?
[11:19:59] <Paradisee> i have to make all the element i drop with a unique id
[11:20:12] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: its all stored in the json
[11:20:21] <robertmaxrees> ditch the array imo.
[11:20:22] <robertmaxrees> but meh.
[11:20:35] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/3GPCQWR
[11:20:39] <Paradisee> just a little example
[11:20:55] <Paradisee> under "items" theres a '3'
[11:21:05] <Paradisee> it is taken from the array
[11:21:20] <robertmaxrees> i'd perosnally avoid that, but you're going to disagree with me anyway.
[11:21:29] <robertmaxrees> *personally
[11:21:38] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: i can do whatever is better than this
[11:21:48] <Paradisee> im not gonna disagree on something
[11:21:56] <Paradisee> i just say my opinion before doing something
[11:22:00] <robertmaxrees> i suggested things to you a while ago to improve on this JSON and you kind of ignored me soooo....
[11:22:12] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: the json is pretty improved
[11:22:44] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/3NE2A90
[11:22:52] <Paradisee> this is the json, the one i pasted before is wrong
[11:23:04] <robertmaxrees> still doesn't really make sense to me.
[11:23:10] <Paradisee> what?
[11:23:13] <robertmaxrees> the structure.
[11:23:30] <Paradisee> explain why
[11:23:46] <robertmaxrees> could the base object have properties other than "lights"?
[11:23:54] <Paradisee> yes
[11:24:04] <robertmaxrees> then you're already munging your data.
[11:24:10] <Paradisee> mungung?
[11:24:44] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: what do you suggest then
[11:24:49] <robertmaxrees> let me show you.
[11:25:06] <Paradisee> ive been thinking on the best way to make this json, and it seems so
[11:26:28] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/mdacsr8/ something like this.
[11:26:52] <Paradisee> nope robertmaxrees
[11:26:58] <Paradisee> images could be different
[11:27:00] <thinkxl> robertmaxrees: http://cl.ly/image/1E0p2E080Y14
[11:27:07] <thinkxl> i'm trying to get a token using basic auth
[11:27:40] <thinkxl> my code is like this robertmaxrees http://cl.ly/image/1a3v1I1D2h3D
[11:27:43] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee for what?
[11:27:51] <thinkxl> sorry but is a pain in the ass to copy/paste from tmux/vim
[11:27:51] <Paradisee> for what what?
[11:28:09] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee "images could be different" - i fail to see how that's relevant.
[11:28:21] <robertmaxrees> thinkxl you want .done(), not done:
[11:28:24] <robertmaxrees> it's a chained callback.
[11:28:28] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax().done()
[11:28:32] <Paradisee> it is based on the element you drop
[11:28:34] <robertmaxrees> and don't use success.
[11:28:34] <thinkxl> ooooooh
[11:28:35] <thinkxl> ok
[11:28:40] <thinkxl> why?
[11:28:44] <Paradisee> that can be a light, or a tv, or what ever you want
[11:28:49] <Paradisee> so the images are different
[11:29:05] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee then extend this structure to support that imo.
[11:29:06] <robertmaxrees> but whatever.
[11:29:18] <robertmaxrees> thinkxl because that's how the deferreds system works.
[11:29:23] <robertmaxrees> and success is deprecated.
[11:29:34] <thinkxl> damn
[11:29:40] <thinkxl> so .done() and .fail()
[11:29:42] <thinkxl> instead, right
[11:29:43] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:29:46] <Paradisee> "type": "light"
[11:29:59] <Paradisee> if i want to turn off each light, gotta iterate on the whole json
[11:30:15] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee define objects and give them properties instead of your categorical topology from before.
[11:30:19] <Paradisee> in the way i did, i dont need to iterate over it, but just on the category
[11:30:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?  you shouldn't enumerate in that case.
[11:31:08] <robertmaxrees> you should have something on the element to tie it back to that part of the JSON.
[11:31:42] <Paradisee> i still don't get your point of view
[11:31:47] <robertmaxrees> data-objectid="object_3", then you look up that corresponding part in your JSON - data.objects.['object_3']
[11:32:07] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to use an array to give you some kind of key, instead of letting the object do that for you.
[11:33:00] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: i undestund that but not how to make it
[11:33:54] <robertmaxrees> then learn how to?  you've been in here quite a bit asking the same kinds of basic questions over and over.  it sounds like you'd be served well doing a simple tutorial or three.
[11:34:21] <Paradisee> rq
[11:34:29] <Albius> Hi everyone.
[11:34:32] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: your wrong, doesnt matter
[11:34:39] <robertmaxrees> LOL
[11:35:00] <Paradisee> my questions are all about syntax
[11:35:55] <phelix> say I have <div class="description">Here is my descritpion</div> and I wanted to get the div and the text inside it? How would I go about doing that
[11:36:00] <phelix> I basically want that piece of HTML
[11:36:10] <robertmaxrees> and data structures, event bindings, etc - that's why i made that suggestion.
[11:36:31] <robertmaxrees> $('.description');, phelix
[11:36:35] <csd_>  tried two different json libs and still not working.. the output looks just like what i wrote. does the server perhaps need to return a certain HTTP code / MIME type etc for the response to parse correctly?
[11:36:47] <csd_> hrm, meant to direct that at you robertmaxrees
[11:37:20] <paulvd> i have a fiddle here, which shows the submit button only when all fields are filled up http://jsfiddle.net/m3p25nLk/

[11:49:28] <fredy_> Hi, good afternoon, good evening, good morning, I am new with jquery. I am using jquery-file-uploader and i would like some help! I need to upload the file i selected when i click on a button
[11:50:06] <decx> there's an example of just that in the docs fredy_
[11:50:38] <fredy_> hi decx, I am trying without success
[11:50:50] <fredy_>    <script>                         $(function(){             $('#fileupload').fileupload({                 replaceFileInput: false,                 dataType: 'json',                 url: '<%= ResolveUrl("AjaxFileHandler.ashx")%>',                 done: function (e, data) {                     $.each(data.result, function (index, file) {                         $('</p>').text(file).appendTo('body');                     });            
[11:51:02] <fredy_> I have that and a couple of buttons
[11:51:32] <fredy_> the idea is call that function when I click on: btnUpload
[11:52:31] <decx> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Basic-plugin#user-content-how-to-start-uploads-with-a-button-click
[11:53:01] <decx> i dont see any add in your paste
[11:53:18] <fredy_> Thank you decx!!!
[11:53:24] <decx> thank the docs
[11:53:31] <fredy_> let's rock!
[11:53:38] <fredy_> god bless you
[11:53:40] <decx> you're just lucky that i used that last week ^^
[11:53:50] <fredy_> ty!
[11:54:09] <fredy_> i have to go back to work, thank you so much!
[11:54:21] <fredy_> have a great day decx!
[11:55:03] <decx> if you figure out how to access the thumbnail url in the handle_form_data php function let me know ^^
[11:55:38] <decx> building it myself from $file->name is tedious
[12:07:00] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/17MHRGM
[12:07:39] <Paradisee> what happen if i make a ajax request to check if the id already exists in the json there?
[12:08:10] <Paradisee> should i stop the script and wait for the ajax async request?
[12:12:18] <SuperrMann> whats the best way of calling a nested json element using $(this) element?
[12:16:42] <doug64k> Paradisee: you want that?
[12:18:05] <doug64k> Paradisee: there's no reason to make anything synchronous in js
[12:18:49] <doug64k> unless freezing up the users browser is what you want
[12:20:48] <Paradisee> doug64k: i mean what happen if i make an ajax call there
[12:20:59] <Paradisee> will it mess up all the whole script?
[12:21:05] <doug64k> where
[12:21:08] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/17MHRGM
[12:21:13] <Paradisee> 17
[12:24:38] <doug64k> Paradisee: in the json that it hasn't loaded yet right?
[12:24:53] <Paradisee> it is
[12:26:29] <doug64k> Paradisee: hmm, can you update that paste to show what you would do - assuming it were synchronous (so I am sure I follow what you want)
[12:26:31] <doug64k> brb
[12:26:40] <Paradisee> sure
[12:30:31] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/0PPPBT8
[12:35:13] <Paradisee> doug64k: http://dpaste.com/2PWQ6NN
[12:37:24] <paulvd> sala
[12:39:48] <doug64k> if you return what $.ajax returns, the caller write code that can deal with it being asynchronous. those return values return to the browser, not the check_id caller
[12:39:58] <doug64k> the caller can*
[12:40:23] <doug64k> if you need to process the ajax then return something, that can be solved with promises...
[12:40:34] <doug64k> I'll show check_id to illustrate
[12:43:17] <Paradisee> that's what i mean doug64k
[12:53:57] <doug64k> Paradisee: http://dpaste.com/3YV9273   look at check_id()
[12:54:33] <doug64k> and line 133
[12:54:54] <Paradisee> ty, ill take a look
[12:57:01] <Paradisee> false Object {top: 105, left: 165.265625}
[12:57:03] <Paradisee> still return false
[12:58:45] <doug64k> Paradisee: what I'm illustrating is how you would go do multiple ajax requests then wait for them all to be done and process their results. does check_id make sense to you>
[13:02:25] <doug64k> Paradisee: $.when.apply($, array).done(function() { ... the arguments array has one result per request in array ... })
[13:02:48] <brandonjjon_> Wondering if someone could help me figure out why a third level drop down is not expanding. If you look at Bikes -> Race, "Shop by Brand" is not expanding as it should http://162.252.104.146/
[13:03:23] <brandonjjon_> I think it's superfish
[13:03:59] <robertmaxrees> brandonjjon_ you might get more help if you setup a test case btrw.
[13:04:02] <robertmaxrees> *btw
[13:04:39] <doug64k> brandonjjon_: nothing expands on mouseover for me
[13:04:47] <robertmaxrees> you have to click it.
[13:04:48] <doug64k> the sidebar on the left?
[13:04:56] <brandonjjon_> robertmaxrees: I'm not sure how I would do that. I don't really have a good understanding of javascript in general. Just enough to be dangerous. Hoping someone can just point me in the right direction.
[13:05:10] <doug64k> oh, have to click the down arrow thing
[13:05:40] <brandonjjon_> Not mouseover, click the little arrow
[13:06:02] <brandonjjon_> doug64k: Yes the sidebar
[13:06:29] <brandonjjon_> doug64k: You can expand Bike > Race > but 'Shop by Brand' does not expand as it should
[13:07:19] <doug64k> brandonjjon_: http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2F162.252.104.146%2Fbmx-bikes-complete.html&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0
[13:07:41] <doug64k> you might want to fix the major html errors first
[13:07:50] <doug64k> problem might disappear
[13:08:32] <doug64k> unclosed tag is very likely to cause hierarchy issues
[13:09:18] <brandonjjon_> doug64k: You may be right. This is magento so I have no idea what file that might be in. Yikes.
[13:09:30] <doug64k> the validator gave up :)
[13:09:34] <doug64k> not a good sign
[13:09:41] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i'd hire a dev at this point.
[13:10:05] <brandonjjon_> Validator gave up?
[13:10:19] <robertmaxrees> he linked to the W3 validator result for your site.
[13:10:25] <brandonjjon_> robertmaxrees: Yes I have it open
[13:10:28] <robertmaxrees> your html isn't properly written, which can cause strange bugs.
[13:10:48] <robertmaxrees> see the line that says " Element a not allowed as child of element ul in this context. (Suppressing further errors from this subtree.)"?
[13:11:23] <doug64k> Error Line 752, Column 91: Cannot recover after last error. Any further errors will be ignored.
[13:11:29] <robertmaxrees> and that.
[13:12:25] <brandonjjon_> Feeling a bit overwhelmed now. I was tasked with fixing that drop down and who know's what file the unclosed tags could be in.
[13:12:27] <doug64k> brandonjjon_: which js file is the code custom made for this page
[13:14:15] <doug64k> scripts.js line 5 is the menu??
[13:16:15] <thinkxl> how to enable basic auth with cross domain using $.ajax ? I have enabled CORS in the server
[13:17:33] <doug64k> thinkxl: crossDomain: true   in the options.
[13:18:07] <robertmaxrees> you might need to set xhrFields: { withCredentials: true } as well.
[13:20:28] <doug64k> beforeSend: function(xhr) { xhr.setRequestHeader("Authorization", "Basic " + base64encode(username + ":" + password)); }
[13:22:09] <brandonjjon_> doug64k: I think it's superfish
[13:22:26] <brandonjjon_> doug64k: I can actually remove all content from scripts.js and the menu still works
[13:22:44] <robertmaxrees> brandonjjon_ it's really hard for us to help you without a paired down example.  we're telling you places to start (like the bad markup) because that's what we'd do in your case.
[13:24:05] <doug64k> yeah it's not. that code is a see of style manipulation so it took a few moments to figure out what was going on
[13:24:13] <doug64k> sea*
[13:24:38] <doug64k> no scripts.js*
[13:24:42] <doug64k> not*
[13:24:48] <doug64k> damn laptop keyboard lol
[13:25:39] <doug64k> perhaps 20ms is not long enough of a delay before hitting enter :D
[13:25:57] <torbjorn> is there a way to tell if an element is likely to have information in a value attribute or in its content?
[13:26:15] <robertmaxrees> torbjorn what do you mean by "likely"?
[13:26:20] <doug64k> torbjorn: likely?
[13:26:33] <torbjorn> an input of some kind would have a value attibute, a textarea or most other elements would have .text()
[13:26:50] <torbjorn> a field that has contenteditable for example
[13:26:55] <torbjorn> hm perhaps only input has value
[13:27:04] <torbjorn> guess that could work
[13:27:08] <robertmaxrees> check the value with .val() - depending on what that returns, fall back to .text()
[13:27:10] <BillCriswell> textarea and select as well.
[13:27:12] <robertmaxrees> that's another way.
[13:27:28] <torbjorn> robertmaxrees: empty input could be valid too
[13:27:43] <torbjorn> i mean, an empty string could be valid data
[13:27:55] <doug64k> value in $(this)[0] ?
[13:29:01] <torbjorn> if thats undefined, i should go for .text?
[13:29:24] <torbjorn> perhaps the cleanest way yes
[13:31:07] <robertmaxrees> that was weird
[13:31:21] <torbjorn> i could test if given selector and that selector:input .is the same element.. there is some trickery involved in identifying undefined i think i remember
[13:31:42] <doug64k> torbjorn: why not $(':input')
[13:32:14] <torbjorn> the element is given, i need to figure out if i should fetch its .val() or .text()
[13:33:14] <doug64k> torbjorn: perhaps $(this).contents().addSelf().length > 1
[13:33:22] <Paradisee> doug64k: do you have team viewer?
[13:33:25] <doug64k> if there are children, probably .text(), else probably .val()
[13:33:28] <doug64k> Paradisee: yes
[13:33:29] <Paradisee> doug64k: i can show you
[13:34:25] <torbjorn> it wont have children
[13:39:50] <gnarf> torbjorn: you might want .html()
[13:41:19] <gnarf> torbjorn: but yeah, :input will give you all the normal "form inputs" - you can also .is("[contenteditable]") or similar
[13:41:22] <torbjorn> $(el).is(":input") // should that work?
[13:41:43] <torbjorn> i actually disable contenteditable before i move on to get the value
[13:44:21] <Left_Turn> are both of these ajax requests? jQuery.getJSON  jQuery.ajax()
[13:44:34] <gnarf> Left_Turn yes
[13:44:43] <Left_Turn> ah thanks gnarf
[13:45:22] <robertmaxrees> Left_Turn if you check out the docs, they clarify for you :) getJSON includes a snippet that says "This is a shorthand Ajax function" and shows you what it's shorthand for.
[13:45:24] <robertmaxrees> really helpful.
[13:45:53] <Left_Turn> yep i saw it but just wanted a human clarification.. sry:)
[13:45:54] <gnarf> torbjorn: input,textarea,select,button <-- ":input"
[13:46:01] <robertmaxrees> Left_Turn it's all good.
[13:48:02] <torbjorn> gnarf: yeah, .is(":input") i think solves it elegantly for me
[13:49:07] <robertmaxrees> awww but i liked my solution :(
[13:51:29] <banister> how do i scope a jquery lookup to a given element, e.g i want my_element.lookup("input") where it only looks up an 'input' element that's a child of my_element
[13:51:36] <robertmaxrees> .find()
[13:51:44] <robertmaxrees> my_element.find('input');
[13:51:47] <gnarf> `api find
[13:51:47] <b-ot> gnarf: .find(): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[13:52:03] * gnarf gives b-ot a cookie
[13:52:40] <robertmaxrees> hoooray b-ot!
[13:59:52] <totesjakey> speak of the devil, I need a iterator that will return after the first time it's callback returns successful
[14:00:25] <totesjakey> I know .filter() works because my set is unique, but I don't want it to keep running after it finds what it needs. Is there a way to do this?
[14:01:54] <gnarf> totesjakey: what you want is .find
[14:02:01] <gnarf> well array.prototype.find
[14:02:29] <totesjakey> I figured, I was just looking at .toArray() then find :P
[14:02:38] <gnarf> totesjakey: thats ES6 tho
[14:02:42] <gnarf> so
[14:03:07] <totesjakey> screw it ill stick with filter for now, thanks though
[14:04:41] <gnarf> jQuery.fn.filterFirst = function( fn ) { var result = []; this.each(function() { if ($(this).is(fn)) { result.push(this); return false; } }); return this.pushStack(result); }; might do it totesjakey
[14:06:05] <totesjakey> yeah I figure I could shim it but at <100 elements I'm not concerned
[14:06:08] <totesjakey> appreciated though
[14:07:24] <gnarf> totesjakey: nod - i love aircoded plugins tho ;)
[14:09:37] <totesjakey> also is there a cleaner way to reset somthing as a jquery object other than $($('..').filter(..).eq(0))
[14:18:58] <gnarf> totesjakey? reset?
[14:20:05] <totesjakey> like its just an HTMLElement after the filter/get, so I need it back wrapped in jQuery's soft, hairy arms
[14:25:57] <Tomashe> hey guys i need some suggestion, anyone did a chat app?
[14:26:12] <Tomashe> im not sure whats teh best way to submit the data between users
[14:29:08] <gnarf> totesjakey: .eq() instead of .get()
[14:29:18] <gnarf> .get() gives an htmlelement, .eq() gives a jQuery
[15:03:21] <tds5016> hi all. Is there a way to run bind on a deferred?
[15:11:51] <__joshua__> what do you mean exactly, example?
[15:12:11] <__joshua__> you want a resolve/reject/notify callback to be bound?
[18:29:09] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know why this isn't working specifically in IE8, but all other browsers? https://pastee.org/ztvvy
[18:29:27] <DeltaHeavy> If I put an 'alert()' in the code blocks they don't fire.
[18:30:24] <Robdgreat> DeltaHeavy: since no one's answering, I'm going to just say becaise IE8, like all other versions of IE, blows.
[18:31:35] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Any error/
[18:32:53] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: None
[18:36:39] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Hmm... is there any other JS? What if you just put an alert above it?
[18:39:18] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: If I put an alert above the event it fires. There's quite a lot of JS in this site, too much to reasonably sort through but I've already done searches for classes relating to this and can't find anything that looks like it would effect this.
[18:40:05] <ceterizine|work> Ive run into scenarios where alert will break in ie8
[18:40:22] <BillCriswell> What if you try: $('.panel-group').trigger('show.bs.collapse') from the command line?
[18:48:23] <verumequals> so I have a json that jquery loads through getJSON and one of the attributes of a json object is a html string. using $(".selector").html("<div></div>);" I can insert html, but when using $(".selector").html("<div>" + data.somepropertywithhtml + "</div>"); the part between the divs is literal text and not html
[18:48:31] <verumequals> what am I doing wrong?
[18:49:12] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: SOrry didn't seeyour message. Trying now
[18:49:50] <BillCriswell> verumequals: Are you sure it's actual < and not &lt; ?
[18:50:08] <verumequals> 100%
[18:50:15] <DeltaHeavy> Doesn't do anything in Chrome even.
[18:50:53] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: No idea then.
[18:51:01] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: SHOULD it be doing something?
[18:51:08] <verumequals> http://pastebin.com/VBExwaXB
[18:51:10] <verumequals> this is my json
[18:52:58] <BillCriswell> verumequals: http://jsbin.com/lejidewezi/edit?html,js,output
[18:53:02] <BillCriswell> Works fine here.
[18:53:19] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: What's the expected result of $('.panel-group').trigger('show.bs.collapse')?
[18:54:23] <verumequals> brb crying
[18:54:26] <verumequals> been giving me an headache
[18:54:34] <verumequals> it would be a encoding problem I guess
[18:54:39] <verumequals> thanks I'll look further into it
[18:55:08] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: http://pastie.org/pastes/9669363/text is what I was thinking. Just to see if IE8 will trigger those events.
[18:56:23] <BillCriswell> verumequals: There is <\/p> in there a lot, which doesn't seem right but doesn't seem to breka anything either.
[18:56:45] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: It's not =/
[18:57:32] <BillCriswell> How about in a page all its own?
[19:00:15] <verumequals> BillCriswell, yeah I read that when using jsons forward slashes should be escaped with \
[19:00:25] <verumequals> which actually seems to be so
[19:00:29] <verumequals> when validating that json
[19:01:12] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: Can't just up and make a page like this in this environment.
[19:01:18] <DeltaHeavy> NONE of the JS is working
[19:01:25] <DeltaHeavy> I swear it was moments ago x.x
[19:01:32] <DeltaHeavy> But there are NO errors
[19:02:11] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: You just need an empty html page with <div class="panel-group">
[19:02:59] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: I can't in this environment though. Super complex C#.NET MVC site
[19:04:04] <BillCriswell> verumequals: json lint doesn't complain about: {"description":"<p>Test</p>"}
[19:04:57] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: It doesn't need to be in the environment though, it can really be just an html page on your computer.
[19:05:15] <BillCriswell> I'd say use jsbin or jsfiddle but not sure they play nicely with IE.
[19:07:07] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: Works here
[19:07:17] <BillCriswell> Blah.
[19:07:55] <BillCriswell> No errors is the worst. I'd rather a totally useless error than no error.
[19:08:10] <verumequals> ah BillCriswell, apparantly it is not mandatory
[19:08:10] <verumequals> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1580647/json-why-are-forward-slashes-escaped
[19:08:18] <DeltaHeavy> For some reason my module borks as soon as I comment what's commented here and add the alert
[19:08:19] <DeltaHeavy> sec
[19:08:54] <BillCriswell> verumequals: Ahhhhh. Nice.
[19:09:09] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: https://pastee.org/td5yx
[19:09:29] <DeltaHeavy> As soon as I do this and try to access 'BELL' from the console it can't be called.
[19:11:02] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: I remove the commented code and it works =/
[19:11:11] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: What in the hell IE8
[19:11:29] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Hmm...
[19:12:40] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: ANY clue what would cause that?
[19:12:44] <DeltaHeavy> Cause this is like...wow
[19:13:10] <DeltaHeavy> Probably THE MOST unexplainable bug I've encounted assuming I don't find some sort of reasoning behind it.
[19:13:17] <BillCriswell> What if you just put an empty comment in there?
[19:14:39] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: It's not working again at all
[19:15:00] <DeltaHeavy> It's 10:15PM here and I'm going friggen crazy right now. Screw all this I'm going home. Thanks so much for your help once again BillCriswell.
[19:15:53] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[19:26:59] <verumequals> Yeah thanks from my side as well
[19:30:41] <jeffreylevesque> can two jquery (ajax) scripts send data to the same script?
[19:31:14] <BillCriswell> verumequals: No problem!
[19:31:30] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: Can you ask that differently? Not following.
[19:32:32] <verumequals> doing a Zend Framework, jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap project here, all by my side for the first time (been developing before with more expertised people)
[19:32:34] <jeffreylevesque> BillCriswell: I have two javascript.  Each has the $.ajax.  Each ajax  points to the same 'url', or php script.  But, for me, only the second instance is executed
[19:33:16] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: How do you know they're executed?
[19:43:10] <__joshua__> loving the engrish
[19:43:44] <hwamokp66> the font that the template specified isn't loading for some reason on my site: http://biogreenenvironmental.com/    This is what it shoudl look like : http://themeforest.net/item/doors-onepage-corporate-multipurpose-template/full_screen_preview/8638508
[19:53:03] <doug64k> dmsuperman: optimized enough yet? http://www.pasteall.org/pic/show.php?id=78819  :)
[19:56:09] <doug64k> that's holding pagedown for 20 seconds
[19:58:08] <__joshua__> doug64k: the horse is dead, doug, stop beating it
[19:58:16] <doug64k> :D
[19:58:58] <verumequals> BillCriswell: I stumbled upon a string that doesn't want to get encoded to JSON
[19:59:05] <verumequals> yet for the love of god I can't figure out which character I am overlooking
[19:59:14] <__joshua__> paste it
[20:00:11] <verumequals> http://pastebin.com/tagp0B1d
[20:00:57] <verumequals> lint did not help me here sadly enough
[20:03:19] <__joshua__> easier to see here http://jsfiddle.net/01omfn3c/
[20:05:01] <verumequals> I don't actually see anything?
[20:06:07] <__joshua__> you get an error, Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token o
[20:06:35] <doug64k> no way, you can go faster and faster http://www.pasteall.org/pic/show.php?id=78820  -> http://www.jstraight.com/1116/24  now never removes
[20:06:53] <__joshua__> verumequals:  whoops, that makes no sense
[20:07:16] <__joshua__> what are you trying to encode?  the js object?
[20:07:26] <verumequals> it does not to me haha
[20:07:40] <verumequals> well it's part of an object, it is a description attribute
[20:07:57] <verumequals> I'm fetching with getJSON and then outputting it on the website
[20:08:03] <BillCriswell> verumequals: The issue is the <\p> before "Boris".
[20:09:07] * Velveeta hands BillCriswell a microphone to drop.
[20:09:56] <BillCriswell> *dropped microphone sound*
[20:10:01] <verumequals> ! wow
[20:10:02] <verumequals> sharp
[20:10:05] <verumequals> thanks a lot
[20:10:13] <verumequals> a shame the error does not really help you anyway
[20:10:33] <verumequals> but this is way I had to escape the forward slash haha
[20:10:37] <BillCriswell> verumequals: Agreed. It would have been nice.
[20:10:54] <BillCriswell> verumequals: Why are you manually escaping these?
[20:11:00] <BillCriswell> or escaping them at all?
[20:11:52] <verumequals> actually I am a little following some page. Since I am injecting it into my site I thought escaping where possible is at least a safer way to go.
[20:11:53] <BillCriswell> verumequals: Also no problem!
[20:14:19] <BillCriswell> verumequals: Where is this HTML coming from?
[20:15:29] <verumequals> for now it's coming from the same server inside a public directory. But it is supposed to be coming from a few booking agencies that want to add their own artists to the list
[20:16:10] <verumequals> this won't happen externally though
[20:17:41] <STR> so this is part of a loop that build a table with some data   tr += "<td>" + object.Pris + "</td>";   how can i remove a symbol or letter from the data
[20:28:18] <grodt> am I able to have a jquery hotswap a font on a page ? I want to be able to press 1-5, and each number, has the font change on the entire page
[20:30:44] <grodt> I think i got it!
[20:31:07] <BillCriswell> You can wait for keypress on body and just alter a body class or something.
[20:33:16] <BillCriswell> grodt: http://jsbin.com/siduzafego/edit?html,js,output
[20:33:21] <BillCriswell> K bed time night.
[20:33:42] <grodt> nice!
[22:16:34] <norc_> Hi. http://pastie.org/private/wgx25fsraftl3y3gvsdw   assuming that code, should $(this) in lines 8 and 10 give me the respective td.foo jqueries?
[22:20:00] <norc_> The triggerEvent uses deferred.reject and deferred.resolve respective.
[22:21:14] <norc_> I am unsure how to get the elements inside the callbacks.
[22:22:05] <norc_> Or would I have to patch the triggerEvent function to use resolveWith=
[22:26:57] <shoky> norc_: http://pastie.org/9669567   you also had a bunch of missing/wrong brackets
[22:28:18] <norc_> shoky: Oh thanks Ill take a look at it. Yeah the computer with the source code is different
[22:36:17] <norc_> shoky: Not working. elem is not defined
[22:37:36] <shoky> norc_: did you add the arguments to the .each callback
[22:38:47] <shoky> anyway as i commented, you can also use $(this) instead, in that line
[22:39:55] <norc_> shoky: Ah. It was just a typo on my end. Working like a charm - but why=
[22:41:05] <shoky> "this" changes inside a function call, best not to rely on it
[22:42:59] <norc_> shoky: Ahh.
[22:43:04] <norc_> shoky: Well thank zou
[22:43:35] <shoky> np
[22:52:31] <Zak> [blocked] The page at 'https://blah.com/foo' was loaded over HTTPS, but ran insecure content from 'http://blah.com/foo': this content should also be loaded over HTTPS.
[22:52:48] <Zak> When I get this error in chrome, my ajax() is never hitting always, fail, done.. or anything.
[22:52:56] <Zak> bug in jQuery? (I swear it used to pick this up as an edge case)
[23:07:04] <shoky> doesn't seem possible with a plain xhr either, in which case, no, no bug
[23:21:54] <doug64k> can someone tell me what the heck is going on here: http://www.jstraight.com/1116/37   why does offset top change after a delay
[23:22:06] <doug64k> run it and see the console
[23:31:28] <shoky> doug64k: same thing that's going on here :P http://www.jstraight.com/1116/38
[23:32:27] <doug64k> shoky: what's going on??
[23:32:54] <doug64k> lol
[23:34:33] <doug64k> shoky: it should not be 0 before a timeout, right?
[23:34:36] <shoky> doug64k: not happening here http://www.jstraight.com/1116/38/show   smth to do with the iframe or being inside that site
[23:35:04] <doug64k> ah, subtle bug in browser I guess
[23:35:39] <doug64k> shoky: thanks! I was getting tunnel vision
[23:36:29] <shoky> heh np
[23:39:13] <doug64k> was making sure my positioning code was right. it was buggy as hell! fixed it up a lot and was removing hacks that offset the scroll when followig links. all fixed up now afaik
