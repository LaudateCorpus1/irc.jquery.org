[03:13:36] <basant> Hi
[03:14:30] <basant> I wanted to learn JavaScript ,Can you please let me know what is the best book & author I go for it.
[03:15:13] <Cork> basant: there is good documentation and howtos on the net if you don't absolute want a paper book
[03:16:04] <Cork> <_<'
[03:16:17] <Cork> sorry for not answering within 60 seconds...
[04:06:49] <Darmani> Cork: 60 seconds is the cutoff bruh.
[04:41:22] <Xatenev> Morning
[04:42:00] <Xatenev> I got a string like: <p><i><strong>Acrylic Acid&lt;i&gt;Sa</strong></i></p>
[04:42:18] <Xatenev> using .text() on this makes it Acrylic Acid <i>Sa
[04:42:25] <Xatenev> How would I get "Acrylic Acid Sa"
[04:53:22] <Xatenev> Got it
[05:28:45] <Duikb00t> hmm Pretty easy and working, https://jsfiddle.net/Lb4zbjL1/  but what if a class is being added at runtime?
[05:29:01] <Duikb00t> Should I wrap it then in a on click event or something?
[05:29:04] <Duikb00t> Or on change?
[05:31:10] <Yepp> do I still need to do return inside a promise to stop the function? Or resolve() is enough?
[05:34:10] <Yepp> found an answer on SO. yes i need to return.
[05:38:55] <stennowork> good day, i am extracting a table from a <template>, and then try to insert a row in it before appending it somewhere in the document, but the row doesn't get inserted. what am i doing wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/t14qn04j/1/
[05:40:52] <stennowork> never mind, i found it out already
[05:41:13] <stennowork> i cannot append to a non-jquery object (.html() just returns a string of course)
[05:48:24] <Cork> stennowork: you can, but you need to store the dom result
[05:49:47] <stennowork> Cork, so, simply: var result = $("tbody", myhtmltablestring).append(myhtmlrowstring); ?
[05:57:57] <Duikb00t> Omg, somewhere I have an issue in my logic, I want to detect if my accordion item (panel) is open or closed thttps://www.pastery.net/jgkgzm/
[05:57:59] <Duikb00t> https://www.pastery.net/jgkgzm/ *
[05:58:12] <Cork> stennowork: no that will store the tbody content
[05:58:40] <Duikb00t> Isuse: I get both of the cosnole.logs on click >< probably because it got changed
[05:58:53] <Cork> Duikb00t: $(this).attr("aria-expanded","true") <-- this sets the value
[05:58:56] <Cork> so is always true
[05:59:02] <Duikb00t> ohmg
[05:59:07] <Cork> (or rather truthy)
[05:59:13] <Cork> as it returns the jquery object
[06:00:02] <Duikb00t> still not the right behaviour when I check on: if( $(this).attr("aria-expanded") == true ) {
[06:00:34] <Cork> Duikb00t: attr is strings not bools
[06:00:41] <Duikb00t> friday
[06:00:45] <Duikb00t> why oh why
[06:01:54] <JosefDe> Hi guys
[06:02:11] <Duikb00t> thx Cork
[06:02:56] <JosefDe> I've a simple question: When I create a checkbox dynamically via Javascript and bind an event to it and the checkbox disappears what happens to the event?
[06:03:17] <Cork> JosefDe: it gets gc:ed
[06:04:04] <Cork> well at least as long as you don't keep a reference to it that is
[06:04:09] <JosefDe> Cork: What? :)
[06:04:22] <Cork> gc== Garbage Collect
[06:04:27] <JosefDe> Aha. Perfect!
[06:04:31] <JosefDe> Cork: Thanks buddy
[06:04:34] <Cork> np
[06:07:37] <Duikb00t> How can I do this ( where in $(this) ) is a class but I want to add css to this:before
[06:07:54] <Cork> you can't
[06:08:05] <Duikb00t> oh
[06:08:40] <Duikb00t> There no workaround for that?
[06:09:00] <Cork> write it in the css files
[06:09:51] <Cork> Duikb00t: the reason is that jquery works with style attributes
[06:09:51] <Duikb00t> merde then I can rmeove my jquery code ><
[06:10:00] <Cork> Duikb00t: and it can only do "current" state
[06:10:03] <Duikb00t> ok
[06:10:12] <Cork> if you need selector handling you can't do it there
[06:10:32] <Cork> Duikb00t: no >_< needed, that is a good thing :)
[06:10:54] <Duikb00t> meh
[06:10:58] <Duikb00t> actually it is yes
[06:11:49] <Duikb00t> I need to check if the class 'in' is on a <div> when a <a> thag is being clicked if so I have to change the background-position property
[06:12:29] <Cork> Duikb00t: is the a a child?
[06:13:43] <Duikb00t> This is how the dom looks like http://i.imgur.com/0MBisE1.png
[06:14:12] <Duikb00t> When clicked on the h4 a > the 'in' class got aded in panel-collapse
[06:14:34] <Duikb00t> What I wan to do is change my title before css property when it has that 'in' class.
[06:16:08] <Cork> Duikb00t: ok so there are two options, either set a class on .panel
[06:16:25] <Cork> Duikb00t: or through js set a class on the a tag when the state changes
[06:16:35] <Duikb00t> I has to go trough js
[06:18:03] <Duikb00t> this was my first aproach: https://www.pastery.net/bbdumh/
[06:22:45] <Cork> Duikb00t: no you don't have to go through js in that form
[06:23:28] <Cork> just do $('.panel-title').on('click', 'a', function() { $(this).toggleClass('state2');  });
[06:24:14] <Cork> btw $('panel-collapse') most likey need to be $(this).closest('.panel.title').find('.panel-collapse')
[06:24:21] * Cork afk
[06:25:14] <Duikb00t> thxxx lets try
[07:08:13] <Jonuz> I have url in string, what is best way to manilulate it's querystring?
[07:08:56] <Cork> Jonuz: $('<a>', { href: s }).prop('search')
[07:09:11] <Cork> if i remember correctly :P
[07:48:32] <mento> Hey i'm trying to replace a partical text string within a TD with a SPAN but want to keep the other text untouched - see: https://jsfiddle.net/x12jc4ko/
[07:48:45] <mento> how can i make sure the text "Not supported" will stay visible?
[07:48:56] <mento> instead of replacing the entire HTML within the TD
[07:56:03] <decx> just remove brackets?
[07:57:23] <mento> decx: i let the people use brackets so the [V] and [X] gets replaced by a nice little icon
[08:01:18] <shoky> you can loop the elements and use .replace on the html, for example
[08:03:00] <decx> right, something like this https://jsfiddle.net/x12jc4ko/3/
[08:03:23] <shoky> heh i went for this.. https://jsfiddle.net/x12jc4ko/2/
[08:04:03] <decx> i'm allergic to filter style selectors ^^
[08:06:36] <shoky> but not to replacing html of ALL <td>'s ?  :P
[08:06:56] <decx> well i'd use a class of course
[08:06:59] <decx> because i have class
[08:07:04] <shoky> well nobody said he can
[08:07:21] <shoky> looks like he's running it on some site, i'd guess
[08:07:49] <shoky> oh actually the last thing he said contradicts that, so nevermind
[08:08:08] <shoky> (by some site i meant not his site)
[08:12:18] <decx> to be fair i just wanted to use the replace function because i think it's pretty cool ^^
[08:12:46] <decx> the fn as second argument that is
[08:14:35] <shoky> aye but i always forget how to use it and can't be arsed to look it up yet again ;|
[08:17:12] <mento> thanks decx and shoky  this is very useful :) i was stuck on this part
[09:07:08] <egonsen> hi! where do i start if i'd like to fix bugs other people found in jquery?
[09:07:20] <catbadger_> hey
[09:07:32] <catbadger_> anyone an expert in jqgrid.
[09:07:35] <catbadger_> ?
[09:28:22] <ilhami> hello world.
[09:28:40] <taplar> aloha
[09:28:56] <ilhami> var serializedData = $form.serialize;
[09:29:05] <taplar> serialize is a method
[09:29:14] <ilhami> aaaaah
[09:29:15] <ilhami> :S
[09:29:24] <ilhami> that may be my problem. I forgot to put ()
[09:29:55] <ilhami> thanks. that solved my problem loooooooooooooooooooooooool
[09:30:00] <taplar> :)
[09:30:10] <ilhami> I was just missing that. Everything else worked fine
[09:43:59] <jomofcw> Hello !
[09:44:15] <jomofcw> Is there a diference using $element[0] and $element.get(0) ?
[09:48:03] <taplar> they're effectively the same
[09:48:49] <taplar> http://www.james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.fn.get
[09:56:31] <jomofcw> taplar hello ^^ ! Thanks !
[10:01:23] <decx> convenient site isnt it
[10:04:22] <jomofcw> Is there a way to apply a class to all element added dynamicaly to another element ?
[10:19:55] <taplar> do it when you add them?
[10:20:44] <taplar> or if you want to decouple a little, throw a custom event on something
[11:23:32] <Trof> Hey guys. Is there a way to insert a value into a HTML table cell if I know the specific indexes with jQuery?
[11:23:59] <Uhkis> yes
[11:24:53] <Trof> Uhkis: What keywords should I be looking for ?
[11:25:15] <Uhkis> Trof: probably all you need is nth-child selector
[11:25:31] <Uhkis> and html() or text() depending on what you're inserting
[11:27:38] <Uhkis> Trof: give me a sec to make an example
[11:28:05] <z1haze_work> Im kinda stumped on something, i have a delegated event listener, that binds to the body, but for whatever reason, it isnt being triggered with i click on the target
[11:28:28] <z1haze_work> $('body').on('click', '#product-set-list .product-variations .swatchanchor', function (e) { and #product-set-list is opened via an ajax request in a dialog/modal .. why wouldnt this trigger ?
[11:29:27] <Uhkis> Trof: https://jsfiddle.net/gbjn042b/
[11:30:21] <Trof> Uhkis: Thanks, I'll try it out right now
[11:30:52] <z1haze_work> am i missing something?
[11:33:26] <shoky> a jsfiddle
[11:34:41] <z1haze_work> i dont have .. i just have a single line to share.. if i bind to the body like i am, and listen to what i am listening to, even if the #product-set-list opens in a dialog (not present on page load) it should listen to that event, right?
[11:34:59] <z1haze_work> im not asking you to debug, just clarifications
[11:35:44] <Uhkis> z1haze_work: your selector is probably wrong
[11:36:00] <z1haze_work> agh ffs, i figured it out
[11:36:17] <z1haze_work> its wrapped in a big if statement checking for if an element exists :\
[11:37:20] <Trof> Uhkis: Thanks, got it working now. Appreciate the help!
[12:22:25] <taplar> momma told us we were good kids...
[12:23:27] <robertmaxrees> momma always said life was like a box of chocolates.
[12:23:39] <taplar> heh
[12:24:00] <taplar> i liked to change that one up to be, people are like a box of chocolates
[12:24:07] <taplar> you never know which ones are full of s...
[12:24:12] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[12:24:18] <robertmaxrees> never know which ones taste like toothpaste?
[12:24:19] <taplar> nasty pink center ones
[12:30:47] <heedly> I can't get textcomplete to work.
[12:30:53] <heedly> Here's my code: http://pastebin.com/VrGEMnBs
[12:30:59] <heedly> What am I doing wrong?
[12:31:09] <heedly> I use test as a sample
[12:31:26] <heedly> and I type @test, but I get nothing back.
[12:31:41] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[12:31:52] <taplar> your not in a doc ready
[12:32:04] <taplar> either put it in a doc ready or move your code after your markup
[12:32:07] <robertmaxrees> hah, boom.
[12:33:23] <heedly> taplar: what do you mean a doc ready?
[12:33:35] <robertmaxrees> $(function() { /* your code here */ });
[12:33:46] <robertmaxrees> or $(document).ready(function() { /* your code here */ });
[12:33:57] <robertmaxrees> the issue is that the html doesn't exist yet in the DOM when your js runs.
[12:34:02] <taplar> a document ready delays the logic from executing until the entire document is parsed into the dom
[12:34:11] <taplar> your issue is your trying to find elements that do not exist yet
[12:34:17] <robertmaxrees> so the JS can't find any of the elements you're looking for.
[12:35:38] <heedly> ok, I just added $(function() {code}, and I still get no lookup.
[12:35:57] <taplar> fiddle?
[12:39:09] <shoky> `cache` isn't defined anywhere
[12:39:58] <robertmaxrees> also missing a var in front of dictDef
[12:41:39] <shoky> tho their docs also use cache like that, donno what they want
[12:42:13] <taplar> maybe their plugin throws the cache on the window?
[12:42:57] <Uhkis> yeah, throw that cache out the window!
[12:43:02] <taplar> lol
[12:43:37] <taplar> traffic mayhem ensues
[12:44:55] <shoky> nope they don't
[12:45:08] <shoky> heedly: use a better plugin
[12:45:14] <shoky> with normal docs
[13:00:42] * taplar loves puns
[13:01:39] <taplar> I saw a marathon runner once that had an att emblem on his jersey.  I thought it was weird.
[13:01:45] <taplar> I mean, sprint all the way.
[13:05:27] <glowdemon1> Hi. I'm trying to use the jQuery slider, but it constantly gives me a $('').slider() is not a function error. http://hastebin.com/ogufedaqiy.xml here's my code
[13:05:35] <glowdemon1> I tried different versions, none of them worked
[13:06:12] <robertmaxrees> open your console
[13:06:15] <robertmaxrees> $.fn.jquery
[13:06:18] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[13:06:41] <glowdemon1> "1.10.2"
[13:06:57] <robertmaxrees> open your network tab - any 404s?
[13:07:14] <glowdemon1> None
[13:07:32] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:07:42] <glowdemon1> Yeah :/
[13:07:55] <robertmaxrees> mind making a fiddle?
[13:08:04] <glowdemon1> one sec
[13:08:31] <taplar> are you accessing the page on http or https?
[13:08:40] <taplar> cause that one file is being pulled in with //
[13:09:03] <robertmaxrees> oooh or are you loading directly as a file?
[13:09:11] <taplar> or i guess you can pull in https on http, but not vise versa
[13:09:53] <glowdemon1> http
[13:10:05] <glowdemon1> let me check
[13:10:09] <glowdemon1> https://jsfiddle.net/xse0y1hv/ anyways
[13:14:00] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xse0y1hv/1/
[13:14:05] <robertmaxrees> looks like a 3.1.0 issue maybe?
[13:20:13] <glowdemon1> 1.9.1 jquery and 1.9.2 ui seem to have the same problem
[13:20:46] <decx> this isnt this
[13:22:37] <robertmaxrees> glowdemon1 my fiddle is using that combo and that error doesn't happen any more.
[13:23:47] <glowdemon1> One moment, I'll check a different browser
[13:46:14] <mikatone> Hi is it possible to proceed with sumit after preventDefault()  ?
[13:47:45] <robertmaxrees> you can use $.fn.trigger and pass extra data that you check in .on() to see if you should prevent or not.
[13:48:50] <mikatone> robertmaxrees can you give me an example please I'm not familiar with it
[13:49:20] <robertmaxrees> i don't really have time to.
[13:49:29] <mikatone> ok np
[13:49:42] <mikatone> thank you
[13:50:02] <robertmaxrees> why do you want to proceed with it after preventing it.
[13:50:53] <kang00> Is anyone here using Web ide that allows me to run javascript script and access Web Api's free?
[13:51:48] <mikatone> I sugest you to try postman chrome
[13:52:03] <mikatone> if I understand... what you're asking for
[13:52:26] <kang00> I have Firefox mikatone
[13:52:41] <ilhami> You can get HttpRequester for Firefox
[13:52:45] <ilhami> works the same way
[13:54:32] <kang00> My goal is to see any Web Api in action in my browser.  ilhami
[13:55:00] <kang00> I think programmable web.com lists many Api
[13:55:11] <ilhami> also check mashable
[13:55:15] <robertmaxrees> you can use jsfiddle
[13:55:20] <robertmaxrees> or just build actual pages.
[13:55:20] <kang00> Any one of them or similar!!
[13:55:24] <ilhami> oh wait not mashable
[13:55:24] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[13:55:25] <ilhami> lol
[13:55:30] <ilhami> let me find the name
[13:55:41] <ilhami> mashape
[13:55:49] <ilhami> they have a lot of APIs
[13:55:51] <kang00> Mashable seems also same I guess so
[13:56:00] <kang00> Oh I also forgot same error
[13:56:00] <ilhami> it's mashape, not mashable
[13:56:04] <kang00> It's mashape
[13:56:20] <kang00> As I browse tech news
[13:57:59] <kang00> robertmaxrees can you share our Help me to find any small code which run on that site and uses web api?
[13:58:06] <robertmaxrees> on what site?
[13:58:27] <kang00> Jsfiddle
[13:58:32] <kang00> robertmaxrees
[13:58:54] <kang00> Read as or instead of our
[13:59:03] <robertmaxrees> wait what?
[13:59:14] <robertmaxrees> so you want to know how to use jsfiddle to make api calls?
[14:00:51] <kang00> I want to paste a demo or any small sample code or script in jsfidlle and then run it.  Yes that script should use Web Api. robertmaxrees
[14:01:07] <robertmaxrees> "Web Api"
[14:01:09] <robertmaxrees> meaning...?
[14:01:40] <kang00> Programmableweb.com
[14:01:53] <kang00> Can you find Api directory?
[14:02:04] <kang00> I call them as Web api
[14:02:12] <kang00> I want to use any one of them
[14:02:16] <kang00> Or similar
[14:02:33] <kang00> Is my definition Correct?
[14:02:42] <robertmaxrees> can just call it an API.
[14:03:00] <kang00> Ok
[14:03:19] <kang00> I thought there are different kind of apis
[14:03:35] <robertmaxrees> there are, but we can safely assume you mean ones available on the web...
[14:05:10] <robertmaxrees> sooo... are you just trying to learn ajax?
[14:05:13] <robertmaxrees> how to use APIs?
[14:05:22] <robertmaxrees> kind of confused about your goal here.
[14:06:17] <kang00> Just want to see Api in action robertmaxrees
[14:06:29] <robertmaxrees> then use curl?
[14:06:34] <robertmaxrees> like, some of these you can't hit using ajax.
[14:06:37] <kang00> And then will try to learn little bit about ajax
[14:06:44] <kang00> Ok
[14:06:52] <kang00> I don't have machine
[14:06:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:07:00] <robertmaxrees> how are you on IRC right now?
[14:07:09] <kang00> Phone
[14:07:16] <robertmaxrees> so you don't have a computer to use?
[14:09:01] <kang00> I have but it's of my boss.  robertmaxrees
[14:09:27] <robertmaxrees> that's going to be a very limiting factor here.
[14:09:38] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to find apis that allow CORS.
[14:12:51] <kang00> What's cors? robertmaxrees
[14:12:57] <robertmaxrees> cross origin resource sharing.
[14:13:07] <robertmaxrees> basically, if the API doesn't allow it, you can't hit it from a web site.
[14:15:07] <kang00> Can you show Me any demo? robertmaxrees
[14:15:15] <kang00> I can't understand technical terms
[14:15:15] <robertmaxrees> a demo of something that doesn't work?
[14:15:16] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[14:15:28] <robertmaxrees> i mean that you won't be able to use a web ide to use the API.
[14:16:54] <robertmaxrees> fwiw jsfiddle has a setup for you to basically mock your own ajax calls and play with them.

[14:39:27] <glowdemon1> Mh
[14:39:32] <glowdemon1> After hours of searching I found the issue
[14:39:39] <glowdemon1> Well, I didn't find it yet, but it works now
[14:40:05] <glowdemon1> if I put the code in a .js file and include it, the code doesn't work. It does work if I put it in script tags on the same html file, oddly
[14:40:09] <robertmaxrees> bad version combo?
[14:40:18] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[14:40:45] <glowdemon1> And somehow it also works now when I put it in the external file
[14:40:55] <glowdemon1> I really have no clue whats going on, but it works haha
[14:41:22] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you had some caching going on.
[14:41:24] <kang00> robertmaxrees bar is output
[14:41:29] <robertmaxrees> kang00 correct.
[14:41:35] <kang00> I didn't get
[14:41:36] <robertmaxrees> kang00 see the javascript pane?
[14:41:41] <kang00> Hmm
[14:41:47] <kang00> Can you explain please?
[14:41:52] <robertmaxrees> explain what?
[14:41:59] <kang00> That script
[14:42:05] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[14:43:01] <kang00> I don't know what you are trying to explain me by that script
[14:43:27] <robertmaxrees> that's one way to learn how to hit external APIs
[14:43:38] <kang00> Oh I see
[14:43:44] <robertmaxrees> you just mock it out yourself.
[14:43:49] <kang00> Which is api in that script?
[14:43:55] <robertmaxrees> none.
[14:43:57] <robertmaxrees> your own.
[14:44:39] <kang00> I am sorry to say but I think I need spoon feeding
[15:13:55] <johnny_|_> hi, how can i use hasClass method on an array of elements to get per element boolean. i.e. $('.all-elements').hasClass('specific-class') and the expected results should be [true, true, false, true]
[15:14:08] <taplar> use map()
[15:14:16] <johnny_|_> taplar: ok, thanks
[15:17:04] <johnny_|_> uhmm but how to supply map with hasClass method? Do I have to write my own function?
[15:18:04] <taplar> yep, map takes a function as a callback to know what to do
[15:18:43] <taplar> https://api.jquery.com/map/
[15:19:19] <johnny_|_> taplar: ok, got it

[16:29:08] <HowardwLo> robertmaxrees: i want to create a page with several tiles of images, each with a click to copy image button
[16:29:35] <robertmaxrees> so you can paste it on yoiur computer somewhere?

[16:57:03] <regedit> hi
[16:57:40] <regedit> i'm trying to use jquery for (toasting bread, and also) help escape strings for HTML attributes, kind of like PHP htmlspecialchars()
[16:58:28] <regedit> why are people saying to do this $(some element).text(input).html()
[16:58:32] <regedit> it does not seem to work
[16:59:40] <z1haze> any vuejs users here? i have a question about why done is happening when i try to fetch something with vue-resource
[16:59:53] <z1haze> very simple example i'm trying to make: http://dpaste.com/2WJK265
[17:04:48] <HowardwLo> how do i select an image so i can use document.execCommand(‘copy’) ?
[17:05:09] <HowardwLo> I’m trying to mimic the “right click an image and copy image” function
[17:11:52] <regedit> http://stackoverflow.com/a/25207 why does this not escape single/double quotes?
[17:13:01] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:13:55] <regedit> the answer is about using jquery tricks to escape html special characters
[17:14:08] <robertmaxrees> try rephrasing your question
[17:14:24] <regedit> it does escape & < and >
[17:14:32] <regedit> but why isn't it escaping ' and "
[17:15:49] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) could look at the source.
[17:16:32] <regedit> arrgh nevermind... who cares... if it doesnt do that then it doesnt....ughgghh
[17:16:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:16:50] <robertmaxrees> guess i'm confused about the problem you're trying to solve.
[17:16:53] <robertmaxrees> but alright.
[17:17:09] <regedit> i'm concatenating a string of html, including attributes and such
[17:19:09] <regedit> $('.something').append('<div data-lol="'+unsafe_characters+'">'+foo+bar+'</div>')
[17:21:27] <regedit> robertmaxrees: ^ does that explain it
[17:22:25] <robertmaxrees> so what's the problem?
[17:22:47] <regedit> how to escape those unsafe_characters (including single & double quotes)
[17:23:16] <regedit> there seems to have been a jquery trick to do that with .text(...).html()
[17:23:30] <regedit> but apparently that does not escape the quotes :(
[17:24:12] <robertmaxrees> so why do you need to escape quotes?
[17:24:49] <regedit> if unsafe_characters contains " it will break the above data-lol attribute
[17:25:21] <robertmaxrees> so then manually escape escape them.
[17:25:25] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[17:26:45] <regedit> bah nvm
[19:07:01] <catbadger> any leaefletjs ninjas in here?
[19:07:41] <catbadger> what do I do with old occurences of splicelatlngs?
[20:27:54] <midori-rus> is there bootstrap channel?
[20:52:58] <MaesterAemon> Trying to $('body').scrollTo() a certain element. It works but I'm not sure how to make it scroll at a certain speed.
[20:55:44] <MaesterAemon> ah nevermind, for some reason you need to use scrollTop in animate
[21:28:34] <madprops> is .html() async?
[21:28:42] <taplar> no
[21:28:46] <madprops> good
[21:32:33] <madprops> hmm what's a good way to have continuos animations like a fadeout/fadein/fadeout/fadein etc every 300ms ?
[21:32:49] <madprops> nvm it's easy
[21:50:03] <madprops> how would you make this work/pulsate indefinitely? glow/fade/glow/fade etc? http://gsick.com/paste/131/
[21:56:13] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/qas59kv0/
[21:56:21] <taplar> try experimenting with css instead

[22:12:11] <alturic> Hey guys, if I'm pulling something via data['skyconditions6'], is there anyway to remove / and spaces, if they are in the value?
[22:12:44] <taplar> got an example value?
[22:14:30] <alturic> Sunny   Isolated Thunderstorms   Scattered Snow Showers   Clear   N/A   so I wouldn't want to touch Sunny or Clear, but remove the / from N/A or the spaces from Iso Thund and Scat Snow Showers
[22:15:25] <alturic> So I don't know if you can "chain" substrings or something, but that's what I'm essentially looking to do, just remove any spaces and/or slashes (if they exist of course) from the arrays value.
[22:15:47] <alturic> Err substring isn't what I'm looking to do I don't think, .replace I think. :P
[22:18:04] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/4wu4pd5c/
[22:21:39] <alturic> Thanks, I figured it'd have to be regex, if it was just a / it could be done via a single .replace('var'/'');  correct?
[22:22:06] <taplar> replace(/\//g, '') possibly
[22:22:16] <alturic> Oh still regex? Blah
[22:22:26] <alturic> But no, that snippet works perfect.
[22:22:30] <alturic> Thank you, again. :)
[22:22:36] <taplar> you can try it as a string, but the /g makes it global
[22:22:48] <taplar> 'replace all' if you will
[23:18:44] <TWG_> Can anyone help me with looping through an Object?  I've tried $.each and it doesn't work.
[23:50:15] <ngharo> for(var prop in obj) { console.log(obj[prop]); }
[23:57:46] <TWG_> ngharo I've tried that as well and get nothing.
[23:58:30] <ngharo> then it sounds like your object is empty
[23:58:39] <ngharo> console.log it
[23:58:49] <TWG_> I have and it's got 4 items in it
[23:59:49] <ngharo> make a fiddle
