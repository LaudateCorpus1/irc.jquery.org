[00:00:07] <cuci> hi guys! I'm trying to make a modal form with bootstrap but on POST I can't get any of the submited attributes. and console.log($("#form").serialize()) shows only ""
[00:00:16] <cuci> any ideas what I'm doing wrong?
[00:00:23] <cuci> should I paste the code?
[00:02:46] <cuci> this is how I'm trying to submit : http://dpaste.com/0N27B89
[00:05:27] <gtristan> odd, how come when I use console.time ('pony') and console.timeEnd ('pony') in an interval function, I only get the result after the interval is removed ?
[00:09:46] <gtristan> bah, nevermind, that bit is my fault ;-)
[00:15:33] <gtristan> well, looks like I have the choice between removing chunks when a search filter applies, at least removing the first ones first, or living with a 400ms choke point when many rows are removed at once
[00:16:07] <gtristan> the 400ms choke point has a better feel, except that it can be annoying if it happens when you're typing in the search entry
[00:16:49] <gtristan> adding rows on the other hand can be done lazy and the feel is not bad
[00:32:31] <urh> ow, after upgrade from 1.2.x to 1.4.5 // i have a problem with random crashing (got blank - white screen) while clicking during the menues // i think problem is in router.js - changePage function 719 line - code: http://pastebin.com/KD5zDyFG // any hints?
[00:54:48] <xinming> How do I test wether a node is first child of the siblings please?
[01:07:09] <bsah_7> I have a long text from DB. It I try to set it into an input-field, i got some errors (maybe cause of " or other special chars in text).
[01:07:15] <bsah_7> whats the best way to escape those
[01:09:38] <Cork> bsah_7: that most likely depends on the server code generating the html
[01:10:00] <Cork> bsah_7: if you do this client side you should create dom elements and set value there instead of concating html strings
[01:12:26] <bsah_7> Cork: Don't understand fully what you mean. This is my situation: I got a Text from DB (a description of a glossar-word). My JS pull this text "by onlclick on a button" into a form
[01:13:00] <Cork> bsah_7: then you don't need to do anything
[01:13:04] <Cork> just set it on the field
[01:13:21] <bsah_7> than i got "uncaught Type error"
[01:13:25] <Cork> $('#field').val(database.value);
[01:13:42] <jackjackw> bsah_7: you need to sanitise the output, whats your backend written in?
[01:13:45] <bsah_7> but only for the long text, which may contain " or other special chars
[01:13:54] <Cork> jackjackw: no you don't
[01:13:57] <Cork> not if it is done client side
[01:14:10] <bsah_7> for example:
[01:14:15] <Cork> bsah_7: please pb the code
[01:14:16] <Cork> ?paste
[01:14:17] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:14:35] <Cork> (please don't use jsbin)
[01:14:39] <bsah_7> $('#field').val(" This ist the lovely text... but Ohhh no, horrible there are also " qoutes " im my text ... :)");
[01:14:56] <Cork> bsah_7: and you send this js with the content in the js?
[01:15:05] <Cork> not as a response to an ajax call?
[01:15:29] <Cork> so again, please pb the code
[01:15:31] <bsah_7> It's a silly structure with smarty, DB-Data and CMS
[01:15:39] <Cork> please pb the code
[01:15:45] <bsah_7> I generate with smarty and DB-Output those js-command
[01:15:53] <Cork> or we will site here guess for the rest of the day
[01:16:14] <Cork> *here and guess
[01:16:27] <bsah_7> http://jsfiddle.net/sedw1y9u/
[01:17:07] <Cork> ok so you dynamically generate js
[01:17:18] <Cork> then ya, you have to string escape the content
[01:17:21] <jackjackw> bsah_7: just json encode the string before it reaches javascript, problem solved
[01:17:28] <Cork> (as this doesn't happen client side)
[01:17:42] <bsah_7> Cork: yes
[01:18:20] <Cork> bsah_7: so what you need to do depends on the server script/template engine you use
[01:18:41] <Cork> and is better asked in a channel about that server language
[01:18:56] <Cork> as it has little to do with js or jquery
[01:19:49] <Cork> and the solution differs quite a bit for different server language
[01:21:25] <bsah_7> ok, found an easy solution
[01:22:05] <bsah_7> I put the DB-Output to an hidden input field, than i do   onclick... $('target').val( $('hidden').val() )
[01:22:48] <Cork> bsah_7: that is a hack, you should be able to do this cleanly
[01:23:56] <jackjackw> bsah_7: what language is the backend? php?
[01:25:35] <jackjackw> that is a terrible solution
[01:26:36] <bsah_7> jackjackw: yes, php
[01:29:28] <jackjackw> bsah_7: json_encode it then
[01:30:12] <jackjackw> only if its UTF8 coming from the database though
[01:31:45] <jackjackw> bsah_7: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/168214/pass-a-php-string-to-a-javascript-variable-and-escape-newlines/169035#169035 as an example
[01:31:58] <bsah_7> should be UTF8
[01:32:15] <bsah_7> BTW: How can i set value vor textaea?
[01:33:02] <jackjackw> include text inside the textarea element
[01:33:23] <jackjackw> look at textarea docs on mdn
[02:04:48] <Juslintek> Hi anyone worked with Owl Carusel?
[02:06:31] <Juslintek> Which carusel can do unbreakable circle?
[02:06:48] <Juslintek> Like puting first element when its gone the end of the query.
[02:07:57] <Juslintek> left| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |right                 1 |left| 2 | 3 | 4 |right              left| 2 | 3 | 4 |right 1 |
[02:09:02] <Juslintek> ah owl can do it :-)
[02:10:06] <zidoh> is there a way to get $.ajax() to send a GET request where the data is set like a POST request, not in the URL?
[02:15:01] <Juslintek> You mean ajax get to php listening for post?
[02:15:11] <Juslintek> Ofcourse you can send, but it wont do anything.
[02:16:06] <cuci> hi guys! I'm trying to make a modal form with bootstrap but on submit I can't get any data. This is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/ugu609ug/
[02:16:13] <cuci> hi guys! I'm trying to make a modal form with bootstrap but on submit I can't get any data. This is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/ugu609ug/
[02:16:19] <cuci> sorry
[02:16:29] <cuci> Could you please give me a hand with it?
[02:16:37] <zidoh> no, i mean sending the supplied data in the payload instead of the URL as GET params
[02:16:43] <cuci> serialize() only returns ""
[02:18:10] <cuci> I'm new to js and usually my errors are typing errors, but this one I can't get the handle of it
[02:21:44] <Juslintek> zidoh, you can use xml. :-)
[02:23:33] <Juslintek> cuci, pass via context: modal and in success use it.
[02:23:48] <Juslintek> modal.modal
[02:23:57] <zidoh> Juslintek: I really really don't want to use XML, but i do want to use JSON :-)
[02:24:42] <Juslintek> zidoh, then use json, but pass it as a link to it and then parse the get json file.
[02:25:10] <cuci> Juslintek: sorry I'm new to this. I've tried modal.modal.serialize() but I get "is not a function error"
[02:26:22] <Juslintek> cuci, try renaming modal var to modal1
[02:27:23] <cuci> modal1.modal gets me "Reference error: modal is not defined"
[02:27:55] <Juslintek> as well you need to serialize form
[02:29:42] <cuci> yeah weeeel the was another atempt but I console.log(form.serialize()) returns ""
[02:30:27] <cuci> you can try at specialistu.no-ip.org:10111
[02:35:18] <Justus> hi
[02:35:37] <Justus> is this channel also the right place for ui questions?
[02:37:32] <Juslintek> cuci, here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/ugu609ug/6/
[02:37:39] <Juslintek> now it should work.
[02:37:51] <jonkristian> When dragging and dropping into an iframe and posting through ajax in firefox i see a get request to file / and domain 42 o_O, anyone ever experienced something similar?
[02:38:21] <jonkristian> It should be get front and a fqdn
[02:38:25] <Juslintek> Justus, yes.
[02:38:32] <Justus> Juslintek: thank you
[02:39:14] <jonkristian> I don't see this behaviour in chrome for instance, it's weird because I dont know what 42 comes from.
[02:39:47] <Juslintek> jonkristian, where iframe links to?
[02:40:16] <jonkristian> local template
[02:40:22] <jonkristian> so no cors
[02:40:41] <Justus> Alright, I have a sortable inside a sortable, and the sortstop event is triggered twice, once for the target and then again for the source sortable. If I just us a dragable not containing a sortable the sortstop event is triggered only once.
[02:40:41] <jonkristian> It's a template i am using to generate pdf's
[02:41:03] <Justus> how do I get that down to only triggering once and only for the target sortable?
[02:42:55] <Juslintek> jonkristian, why not url = iframe.attr('src'); and get the html of template and html it into some div?
[02:43:23] <jonkristian> Juslintek, I need to preserve the css
[02:43:50] <Juslintek> why not make scoped css
[02:44:03] <jonkristian> Hmm
[02:45:38] <Juslintek> Or on success you can $('iframe').on('load', function() { /* do some stuff */ });
[02:46:35] <jonkristian> Juslintek, everything works in both chrome, opera, firefox on windows and linux. On osx you get forwarded to http://42/
[02:47:06] <jonkristian> Juslintek, the actualy form is not inside the iframe, i just use the content in the iframe to return a position for where the photo is dragged.
[02:48:19] <jonkristian> On FF in windows and linux I don't get the redirect but it does show a get request to / on domain 42
[02:48:50] <Juslintek> maybe some url rewrite rules, because of amp config
[02:49:00] <Juslintek> returns you that
[02:49:04] <jonkristian> hmm
[02:49:34] <jonkristian> it is strange to say the least
[02:50:01] <Juslintek> It its working on other machines, that its problem with machine configs
[02:50:04] <jonkristian> oh and the get request for domain 42, I get that only in firefox
[02:50:05] <Juslintek> or setup.
[02:50:26] <Juslintek> reinstall firefox :-D
[02:50:27] <jonkristian> Juslintek, same thing happens locally and in production two different servers.
[02:50:58] <Juslintek> then need to look into firefox specific cases.
[02:51:00] <jonkristian> it also happens for other people and it's not specific to the post that i am doing the dnd in
[02:51:20] <jonkristian> I've already ruled that out.
[02:51:58] <Juslintek> Well I don't know then. It something not common. :-)
[02:52:07] <Juslintek> Its*
[02:52:21] <jonkristian> Yeah, been googling:D Kinda funny it returns _42_
[02:52:46] <BarnaSzalai> anyone using PhpDoc for Sublime?
[02:57:41] <Juslintek> jonkristian, well I would use dev tools networking and console as well some breakpoints to figure out the source of that.
[02:59:05] <jonkristian> Juslintek, yeah :)
[02:59:22] <jonkristian> thanks Juslintek
[02:59:51] <Juslintek> Well I suspect it will end up at php level, where request is returned from php and something if fucked up with $_SERVER params :-D
[03:00:41] <jonkristian> Juslintek, it happens on two entirely different servers though. Maybe it has something to do with the framework im using laravel.
[03:01:38] <Juslintek> jonkristian, ofcourse.
[03:02:05] <Juslintek> THen this is the real source of your problem.
[03:04:15] <jonkristian> Juslintek, best to start looking and the server side then?
[03:04:47] <Juslintek> well that url is returned from server side. Because it happens on post success or failure.
[03:04:55] <jonkristian> yes
[03:05:03] <jonkristian> thanks, i will look at my functions
[03:05:03] <Juslintek> and post goes to php
[03:15:58] <urh> ow, after upgrade from 1.2.x to 1.4.5 // i have a problem with random crashing (got blank - white screen) while clicking during the menues // i think problem is in router.js - changePage function 719 line - code: http://pastebin.com/KD5zDyFG // any hints?
[03:25:59] <jackjackw> can you chain reduce onto a .parents()? I can't seem to get it working
[03:26:38] <jonkristian> Juslintek, found it
[03:26:43] <jonkristian> https://github.com/rkusa/zepto-dnd/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=42
[03:26:50] <shoky> .get().reduce() ?
[03:26:54] <jonkristian> wth
[03:27:05] <Cork> jackjackw: you most of the time want to use .closest() not .parents()
[03:27:36] <jackjackw> nah i want parents, i need the whole tree up to root dom el
[03:27:54] <jonkristian> Juslintek, could you think of any reason he would apply that "fix" ?
[03:27:57] <Cork> jackjackw: ok, what do you mean by reduce?
[03:28:04] <Juslintek> jonkristian, nice so it was js afterall :-)
[03:28:17] <jackjackw> Cork: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce
[03:28:23] <jonkristian> Juslintek, so glad i found it, was going crazy over this.
[03:28:40] <Cork> jackjackw: ya i know the function, but i mean what is it you're trying  to accomplice
[03:28:51] <Cork> might be better ways to get the job done
[03:29:05] <jackjackw> Cork: http://pastebin.com/F9YVtwvi
[03:29:24] <jackjackw> something like that would be nice
[03:29:41] <Juslintek> jonkristian, probably some quick walkaraund some obstacle for time being and forgot to take it down. :-D
[03:29:58] <shoky> .get().reduce() ?
[03:30:01] <jonkristian> Juslintek, yeah
[03:30:13] <jackjackw> shoky: let me try, thanks
[03:30:36] <jackjackw> shoky: that does it
[03:30:47] <jackjackw> why is it I need the call to .get()?
[03:31:01] <Cork> to make the jquery object into an array
[03:31:22] <Cork> though from the code you pasted i don't see why you need .reduce
[03:34:18] <jackjackw> Cork, i need to know whether there are specific selectors inside this array, there can be any number of selectors
[03:34:21] <jackjackw> how would you do it?
[03:34:51] <Cork> selectors?
[03:34:59] <Cork> you mean elements matching a selector?
[03:35:12] <jackjackw> yeah nodes
[03:35:22] <Cork> .filter should do that just fine
[03:35:26] <jackjackw> so i have something like this validAncestors: ['article', 'section'],
[03:35:59] <jonkristian> Juslintek, looks like firefox need this for drag events to work.
[03:36:31] <Cork> jackjackw: $(parent).parents(validAncestors.join(','))
[03:37:11] <jackjackw> and do a ternary on the length to get a true or false Cork?
[03:37:17] <Cork> ya
[03:37:22] <jackjackw> cool, thank you
[03:37:23] <shoky> or:  $(parent).parents().is(validAncestors.join(','))
[03:37:31] <Cork> works too
[03:39:25] <Cork> though .is() is a bit expensive so i tend to stay away from it
[03:40:08] <Cork> jackjackw: actually if you only want to know if it exist you really do want .closest() :)
[03:40:27] <shoky> is() would be more expensive than parents(selector)  here?
[03:40:51] <Cork> shoky: .is makes a selection and then checks if there is a match between the two element arrays
[03:41:06] <Cork> at least it used to do that
[03:41:15] <Cork> haven't checked again in ages
[03:41:47] <shoky> hm i thought it just checks each element in your collection to see if it matches
[03:43:01] <Cork> yup still does it winnow
[03:43:15] <Cork> it makes a query and then loops it with $.grep
[03:43:32] <jackjackw> thanks for the help guys
[03:44:27] <Cork> shoky: return jQuery.grep( elements, function( elem ) {	return ( jQuery.inArray( elem, qualifier ) >= 0 ) !== not; });
[03:48:56] <Cork> shoky: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=winnow
[03:49:03] <Cork> man i had to hunt for that link...
[03:52:50] <shoky> Cork: yeah but i think for the case of .is(simpleSelector)  it would just do a regular filter on the collection
[03:53:03] <shoky> not the $.grep branch
[03:54:00] <Cork> shoky: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=jQuery.filter
[03:54:01] <Cork> :)
[03:54:11] <Cork> but ya they have added matches support if the browser has it
[03:54:30] <Cork> but filter does the same grep loop too
[03:55:45] <Cork> so ie9+ and most other browsers should do fine
[03:55:59] <shoky> yea but in this case it runs on the original jquery collection,  in the other case it first does a query and runs the grep on that
[03:59:21] <shoky> oh but maybe jQuery.find.matches does a query? adunno
[04:00:16] <shoky> anyways yea i'll be more wary of .is ;)
[04:00:55] <Cork> this is kinda a gray area
[04:01:05] <Cork> as you need to do some form of filter how every you do it
[04:01:16] <Cork> where i really grunt is when i see .is(':checked')
[04:01:27] <Cork> instead of .prop('checked')
[04:01:46] <Cork> or even $(this).is(':checked') instead of this.checked
[04:05:02] <shoky> heh
[04:15:19] <jackjackw> anyone available to help me with structuring a plugin correctly? I'm having scoping issues. First time plugin author :)
[04:25:00] <wa5ted> jackjackw: you read the jquery guide to plugins
[04:47:15] <mooncup> anyone know of a decent way for me to select all elements with a specified class that arent' a parent of $(this) ?
[04:47:41] <Cork> $('.the-class').not($(this).parents())
[04:48:31] <Cork> or if you just want the direct parent $('.the-class').not(this.parentNode)
[04:49:16] <Juslintek> can someone tell me why I get this error from owl.carousel? http://it-panevezys.lt/lt/
[04:49:29] <Juslintek>  Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token < on Doctype
[04:49:53] <Juslintek> Resource interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type text/html: "http://it-panevezys.lt/lt/inc/owl.carousel.min.js".
[04:51:32] <sahbeewah> is that not an obvious enough error message for you
[04:51:49] <Cork> Juslintek: you mean except that you're trying to load an html page as js?
[04:52:37] <Juslintek> But I'm not, if I disable owl.carousel everything is working fine.
[04:52:49] <Juslintek> Maybe carousel is doing something wrong
[04:53:15] <Juslintek> It is only owl.carousel causing this problem.
[04:53:52] <Cork> Juslintek: put http://it-panevezys.lt/lt/inc/owl.carousel.min.js in the browser an loop
[04:53:58] <Cork> you get an html page
[04:54:05] <mooncup> lovely Cork
[04:54:06] <mooncup> cheers
[04:54:07] <Cork> loop==look
[04:54:22] <Juslintek> Cork, found the problem :-D
[04:54:25] <Juslintek> Wrong src
[04:54:44] <Juslintek> Its looping back to main page, because target is not found.
[04:58:08] <glambert> Hi, how would I go about scrolling the page so that the bottom of the selected element is at the bottom of the viewport?
[05:01:48] <Cork> glambert: move the scrollTop value to the element top  + viewport height - element height
[05:13:48] <jost> When putting this string into jQuery: '<message type="chat"><body>foobar</body></message>', the body seems to be thrown away... why, and how to fix that? Its an XMPP XML message
[05:20:54] <shoky> jost: the browser strips some tags when parsing an html snippet. you can use $.parseXML
[05:30:20] <jost> shoky: Thanks
[05:32:41] <znow> Heya, I have an array of fields (input and select fields, 4 to be exact). I want to filter through those fields, and return true if ANY field has a value. Would I use the .filter() method or another?
[05:34:36] <pdcmoreira> guys, in select2, how can i use a font-awesome icon instead of select2.png
[05:34:38] <shoky> yep .filter() works
[05:35:58] <znow_> shoky: fields.filter(function (index, element) { return !$(element).val() ? validationMessage = errorMessage : validationMessage;   }); would this be correct?
[05:36:44] <Cork> znow_: just .filter(function() { return !$(this).val() }) should do
[05:37:24] <znow_> Cork: ah yeah, okay thanks.
[05:41:17] <znow_> Cork: would I assign it to a var I could check on for t/f or?
[05:41:44] <Cork> znow_: the filter will return a set of elements that isn't empty
[05:41:56] <znow_> Cork: super, thanks
[05:42:08] <Cork> sorry
[05:42:13] <znow_> is mepty
[05:42:14] <znow_> empty*
[05:42:15] <Cork> return a set of elements that IS empty -_-'
[05:42:16] <znow_> ? :D
[05:42:20] <znow_> yeah
[05:42:24] <znow_> thought so, thanks
[06:26:36] <cuci> Justus: sorry for the delay. Thank you! Your solution worked
[06:44:17] <ravenzz> lazyweb is there a shorthand for var foo = $('.foo'); if (foo.length && foo.is(':visibile')) {} ?
[06:44:29] <ravenzz> I mean avoid var foo =
[06:46:24] <ravenzz> mh maybe $('.foo').is(':visible').length ?
[06:48:07] <ravenzz> oh no
[06:48:20] <ravenzz> $('.foo').is(':visible') is enough :)

[06:57:06] <Cryp71c> jquery mobile 1.4.5: anytime a popup is open that is larger than the page content, any click (specifically, a mousedown) causes the page to auto-scroll to the top. I can't find out how to stop this behavior.
[07:08:56] <stangeland> is it somehow possible to make $.each blocking ?
[07:11:35] <Cork> stangeland: each is sync
[07:11:54] <Cork> stangeland: if you call async code and need to do this in a loop you can't use loops
[07:12:19] <stangeland> Cork, i need to run a statement after the each loop which depends on the each loop being done
[07:12:41] <Cork> stangeland: and each "loop" is doing something async?
[07:12:44] <stangeland> so if there is some sort of each done callback that could also do the trick
[07:12:56] <stangeland> Cork, no its just appending elements
[07:13:19] <stangeland> http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/9490274/
[07:13:22] <Cork> stangeland: js is single threaded, you don't have the problem you're talking about
[07:45:28] <manus> hey folks, any way I can get some eyes and opinions on http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10686 ? (asked this already a few hours ago in #jqueryui-dev, but folks were asleep at the time)
[07:48:29] <BillCriswell> manus: Is there a close event you can use to focus elsewhere when it closes?
[07:53:47] <manus> BillCriswell: yes, but the issue is about default behavior
[07:54:18] <BillCriswell> manus: Understood. I thought you were just trying to get around the issue.
[07:55:20] <manus> BillCriswell: ah, nope, there are a couple workarounds in the ticket comments. just think this case shouldn't need a workaround.
[07:55:47] <BillCriswell> Agreed.
[07:55:49] <manus> the gist is: closing a dialog should not trigger scrolling by default
[07:57:23] <manus> Was just wondering if getting more eyes/comments on it would get the ticket moving somewhere. I'd like to make a pull request if the team agrees to it.
[07:58:44] <BillCriswell> Yeah I dunno manus.
[07:59:26] <manus> Well, one can always hope. :] If you agree, feel free to vote for the issue anyway.
[08:11:16] <callumacrae> This doesn't work in internet explorer on my website, but it works out of context
[08:11:19] <callumacrae> im really confused :(
[08:11:20] <callumacrae> https://gist.github.com/callumacrae/713b753d9ceffc1d4463
[08:11:27] <callumacrae> eg it works in jsfiddle
[08:11:37] <callumacrae> anyone know what the issue could be?
[08:11:52] <cjohnson> looks like IE should support hashchange: http://caniuse.com/#feat=hashchange
[08:12:03] <cjohnson> which part doesn't work in IE?
[08:12:18] <callumacrae> On the website, only "changing" is logged
[08:12:33] <callumacrae> On JSFiddle and any other browser on the website, both "changing" and "changed" are logged
[08:13:17] <cjohnson> and you don't get any errors?
[08:13:22] <cjohnson> this code works in IE on jsfiddle?
[08:13:23] <callumacrae> nope, nothing at all
[08:13:27] <callumacrae> yep
[08:14:11] <callumacrae> Literally the only difference I can see is that the website is adding a click event listener and firing off an analytics event, but it isn't modifying the event at all so I don't see how that could affect it
[08:14:22] <callumacrae> And the hash does change
[08:14:38] <callumacrae> Also, manually listening to $(window).on('hashchange') in the console works fine
[08:14:54] <cjohnson> IE has a console?
[08:15:14] <callumacrae> yep
[08:15:30] <cjohnson> hard to say. I'd guess it's a logic error
[08:15:38] <cjohnson> code path isn't being fired in some certain circumstance
[08:15:50] <cjohnson> especially if the hashchange fires in jsfiddle on IE
[08:16:08] <cjohnson> does IE have a debugger to step through code?
[08:16:25] <callumacrae> egh its going to be one of those fixes which takes like an entire day and then the fix is just a line
[08:16:38] <callumacrae> Yeah, but I don't know where to put the debugger;
[08:16:57] <callumacrae> because the hash is changing
[08:18:16] <cjohnson> have you tried using addEventListener instead of jquery
[08:18:35] <cjohnson> put a debugger in the snippet that should trigger teh event. or anywhere really
[08:18:41] <cjohnson> somewhere before the confusing bit
[08:18:48] <cjohnson> and just follow the code until you get to a part you recognize
[08:21:24] <OnceMe> Hello
[08:21:25] <OnceMe> small issue
[08:21:47] <callumacrae> cjohnson: but events arent traced by the debugger
[08:21:48] <OnceMe> I have inside mainblock div, comment like buttons, now when I click on mainblock I show comments which is fine
[08:22:06] <OnceMe> however since like button is inside mainblock div, when I click like, show comments is called as well
[08:22:09] <OnceMe> how can I avoid this_
[08:22:19] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ OnceMe
[08:22:19] <b-ot> OnceMe: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:22:24] <OnceMe> so when I click in empty inside mainblock div, just to call
[08:22:29] <OnceMe> load comments
[08:22:36] <OnceMe> robertmaxrees:I cant, its complicated code and in OOP
[08:22:37] <callumacrae> OnceMe: Call e.stopPropogation() on the stuff don't want to load comments on
[08:23:03] <OnceMe> so on like button, when I click like button to call e.stopPropogation?
[08:23:28] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe i'm asking for a small example.
[08:23:33] <robertmaxrees> self contained.
[08:23:41] <OnceMe> ok sec
[08:23:47] <callumacrae> OnceMe: yep
[08:25:22] <callumacrae> OnceMe: this? http://jsfiddle.net/Lbmmr244/
[08:25:23] <callumacrae> robertmaxrees: ^
[08:25:43] <OnceMe> http://jsfiddle.net/8dk43spz/
[08:26:03] <OnceMe> callumacrae:yes that
[08:26:10] <OnceMe> so when clicked on like button
[08:26:13] <OnceMe> I dont want to open comments
[08:26:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[08:26:17] <OnceMe> thats what is bothering me :D
[08:26:24] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what your js looks like.
[08:26:28] <callumacrae> why not just attach the event to more specific stuff?
[08:26:34] <OnceMe> I did
[08:26:37] <OnceMe> to a comment icon
[08:26:37] <callumacrae> robertmaxrees: look at mine then
[08:26:41] <OnceMe> but now I want what twitter did :D
[08:26:51] <robertmaxrees> callumacrae i want to see him put in the effor ;)
[08:26:52] <OnceMe> twitter loads comments when you surround whole block
[08:27:18] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe there should be no reason that clicking on reply also opens comments.
[08:27:29] <robertmaxrees> that is, unless, you've bound a listener to .mainblock
[08:27:36] <OnceMe> I did
[08:27:41] <OnceMe> listener is bounded to mainblock
[08:27:52] <OnceMe> so when I click somewhere inside mainblock, it opens comments (fine)
[08:28:05] <OnceMe> however if I click like, which is inside mainblock, it will like but it will also open comments
[08:28:07] <OnceMe> which I dont want to :(
[08:28:13] <robertmaxrees> then you want a to run the stopPropagation() method on the hanlder for .comments.
[08:28:33] <Cryp71c> jquery mobile 1.4.5: anytime a popup is open that is larger than the page content, any click (specifically, a mousedown) causes the page to auto-scroll to the top. I can't find out how to stop this behavior.
[08:28:38] <OnceMe> so is there a method to recognize if I clicked a DOM element, and if I clicked a empty mainblock only?
[08:28:47] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe huh?
[08:28:53] <robertmaxrees> you need two event listeners.
[08:29:56] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8dk43spz/1/
[08:29:57] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[08:30:34] <OnceMe> ok sec
[08:34:32] <robertmaxrees> 5 minutes later I'm going to assume that worked ;)
[08:35:07] <callumacrae> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[08:36:19] <BillCriswell> Still the best smiley ever.
[08:36:28] <OnceMe> it doesnt work
[08:36:32] <OnceMe> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/H8fFk0Uu
[08:36:37] <robertmaxrees> fiddle it please ;)
[08:36:54] <OnceMe> its not functual code
[08:37:02] <BillCriswell> OnceMe: Well there's the issue.
[08:37:07] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[08:37:08] <OnceMe> but do I need to stop propagation on each function
[08:37:17] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe you're asking me to troubleshoot something I can't see...
[08:37:23] <OnceMe> for like, new reply and each element inside mainblock? :(
[08:37:51] <robertmaxrees> you're changing what's bound and stuff, too.
[08:38:18] <OnceMe> ok I made a progress :D
[08:38:25] <robertmaxrees> that's not helpful.
[08:38:25] <OnceMe> I added stopPropagation to like function
[08:38:29] <OnceMe> and now it works
[08:38:31] <robertmaxrees> ...
[08:38:46] <OnceMe> however, when I'm in the middle of page and I click like, its liked but I went on the top of the page
[08:38:47] <robertmaxrees> "to like function"?  okay....
[08:38:55] <OnceMe> and thats because I dont have preventDefault()
[08:39:02] <OnceMe> how to fix that now? :O
[08:39:02] <robertmaxrees> use stopImmediatePropagation() instead.
[08:39:31] <OnceMe> same
[08:39:39] <robertmaxrees> no clue then until you show me.
[08:39:58] <robertmaxrees> you're asking people to fix something they cannot see.
[08:40:13] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Yet people still keep trying to help.
[08:40:21] <BillCriswell> It's the damndest thing.
[08:40:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah i think i'm just going to give up at this point.
[08:40:27] <robertmaxrees> glutton for punishment.
[08:40:49] <robertmaxrees> ┬─┬﻿ ︵ /(.□. ）
[08:41:03] <OnceMe> ok I solved it simply :D
[08:41:08] <callumacrae> ಠ_ಠ
[08:41:13] <OnceMe> I just put after all code for likebtn, return false;
[08:41:18] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[08:41:19] <callumacrae> e
[08:41:20] <OnceMe> so that stops all other code from executing
[08:41:21] <callumacrae> eh*
[08:41:23] <OnceMe> why not?
[08:41:24] <OnceMe> it works
[08:41:29] <OnceMe> I am aware of further issues
[08:41:30] <robertmaxrees> you should be explicit in what you want to do.
[08:41:31] <callumacrae> because it stops all other code from executing
[08:41:51] <robertmaxrees> that's an implicit way to e.stopImmediatePropagation().
[08:41:54] <OnceMe> ok I see
[08:42:05] <callumacrae> and e.preventDefault()
[08:42:29] <robertmaxrees> callumacrae stopImmediatePropagation() combines preventDefault() and stopPropagation()
[08:42:30] <OnceMe> so can I wrap this toggle delegate inside function
[08:42:34] <OnceMe> and stop that function only?
[08:42:42] <robertmaxrees> OnceMe show your code.
[08:42:43] <callumacrae> ah right
[08:42:50] <robertmaxrees> we have no idea what you're working with at this poitn.
[08:43:11] <OnceMe> http://pastebin.com/H8fFk0Uu
[08:43:21] <robertmaxrees> that's not helpful.
[08:43:48] <robertmaxrees> and btw - .delegate() has been superceded by .on() - might want to consider changing over if you're using a reasonably recent version of jquery
[08:44:30] <OnceMe> http://pastebin.com/7vqx1B2r
[08:44:31] <OnceMe> there
[08:44:32] <callumacrae> Wasn't .delegate already superceded by .live and then .on or something?
[08:44:33] <OnceMe> pseudo-code
[08:44:35] <callumacrae> I can't remember that far back
[08:44:42] <robertmaxrees> uuuh.
[08:44:45] <callumacrae> lol what
[08:44:58] <robertmaxrees> one last time, make a functioning fiddle.
[08:45:05] <robertmaxrees> becuase your "psuedo-code" doesn't make sense.
[08:45:06] <OnceMe> I can't
[08:45:13] <OnceMe> its too complicated
[08:45:14] <robertmaxrees> *won't
[08:45:24] <callumacrae> OnceMe: http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[08:45:37] <OnceMe> ok my question is
[08:45:38] <robertmaxrees> also: http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[08:45:43] <OnceMe> how to stop explicitly one function in jQuery?
[08:45:44] <robertmaxrees> and http://sscce.org/
[08:45:54] <robertmaxrees> *javascript, and it depends.
[08:45:59] <robertmaxrees> set a boolean or run a check.
[08:46:05] <robertmaxrees> within the handler, that it.
[08:46:06] <robertmaxrees> *is
[08:46:13] <OnceMe> ok how to wrap my $updates code inside a function?
[08:46:23] <robertmaxrees> dunno - i'd have to see it.
[08:46:37] <OnceMe> http://pastebin.com/H8fFk0Uu
[08:46:40] <OnceMe> how to wrap that
[08:47:06] <cjohnson> for what purpose, OnceMe
[08:47:11] <cjohnson> it's already wrapped in afunction
[08:47:48] <OnceMe> ok how to use that function cjohnson
[08:48:04] <cjohnson> click .mainblock
[08:48:14] <OnceMe> no
[08:48:17] <OnceMe> inside jquery
[08:48:26] <cjohnson> $('.mainblock').trigger('click')
[08:48:33] <OnceMe> if(.mainblock).clicked()) { //ok }
[08:48:37] <OnceMe> something like that
[08:48:53] <cjohnson> something like what I just wrote will fire the function in your paste
[08:49:09] <OnceMe> I need bool output
[08:49:12] <OnceMe> not a trigger
[08:49:44] <cjohnson> that makes no sense
[08:50:10] <robertmaxrees> *this whole thing makes no sense ;) let's move on.
[08:53:30] <OnceMe> ok
[08:53:31] <OnceMe> I fixed it
[08:53:33] <OnceMe> :::DDDDD
[08:53:41] <OnceMe> Im twenty years in and I still win
[08:53:42] <OnceMe> :OOOO
[08:54:01] <callumacrae> \o/
[08:56:35] <OnceMe> yeah smoke ten grams
[08:56:36] <OnceMe> bye
[09:02:42] <cjohnson> phew
[09:03:19] <the_tricky> hello there, guys
[09:03:27] <the_tricky> here is the deal
[09:03:42] <the_tricky> i have a page with a photo grid
[09:03:58] <the_tricky> every pic is clickable (to zoom in a popup window)
[09:04:19] <the_tricky> is there a plugin to make those popup windows act like a gallery?
[09:04:30] <cjohnson> there are lots of gallery plugins
[09:04:44] <cjohnson> https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=lightbox%20gallery
[09:05:27] <the_tricky> cjohnson: thanks a lot
[09:05:39] <the_tricky> cjohnson: haven't noticed that one
[09:52:39] <ApplesInArrays> The JSON object is shown at the bottom. How can I get the <br> to become a break instead of literally "<br>"? http://imgur.com/QUeNHod
[09:53:27] <NoiseEee> ApplesInArrays: use .html() instead of .text() when you put it in the DOM
[09:55:03] <ApplesInArrays> NoiseEee: You're the best.
[09:55:14] <ApplesInArrays> Is that jquery or JS?
[09:56:14] <ApplesInArrays> JQuery. .text() parses as text. .html() parses as html.
[10:01:50] <cjohnson> you can use .textContent I believe for vanilla JS
[10:01:59] <cjohnson> though I think its implementation differs slightly from browser to browser
[10:06:00] <BillCriswell> I think you need to do like innerText || textContent or some shit.
[10:08:44] <cjohnson> well possibly that too. but I recall somebody using textContent and having differing behaviors for how it treated whitespace and newlines
[10:08:59] <ApplesInArrays> I really appreciate the help.
[10:09:00] <BillCriswell> cjohnson: Ah, that's always fun.
[10:09:01] <cjohnson> one browser did what they wanted, the other didn't
[10:09:46] <BillCriswell> cjohnson: The definition of web development.
[10:09:56] <cjohnson> heh
[10:44:33] <rhinojs> hello, i'm having some trouble with json load, i'm using the funcion $.getJSON and generating a table of data, but when i try to select one of the items generated dynamically, it's doesn't select. why?
[10:50:58] <BillCriswell> rhinojs: Would need to see some code.. are you sure you're json result is just an array and not like... { results: [] }
[10:54:41] <BillCriswell> $.getJSON('/products.json', function (result) { console.log(result); }); would be most helpful.
[10:57:48] <rhinojs> BillCriswell: i will try.
[10:58:23] <rhinojs> BillCriswell: i'm doing: $.getJSON( file, function( data ) {
[10:58:30] <Prometheian> I have two libraries that I load dynamically, and I don't always need to load both (weird set of conditions but assume it's necessary), is there an easy way for me to call a function off of an if statement whether it's true or false without replicating the call? I might just be overthinking crap, but like an if/else/always type thing?
[10:59:05] <BillCriswell> rhinojs: YEah, but the struture of data is the important part.
[10:59:30] <cjohnson> Prometheian: call it, store the result in a variable
[10:59:34] <cjohnson> use the variable for the if check
[10:59:38] <cjohnson> and whatever else you need the result for
[10:59:58] <cjohnson> or just put the code after the if/else if you intend for it to always run
[11:00:34] <rhinojs> BillCriswell: the object is okay, want to see the json file?
[11:00:42] <Prometheian> Within the if I do a load and I don't want to call the extra method until after it's loaded. Looks like I'm going to be doing some nested stuff.
[11:01:13] <cjohnson> callback yeah
[11:01:27] <naeluh_facebook> yo
[11:01:42] <cjohnson> yo
[11:02:51] <BillCriswell> rhinojs: Just the first few characters would be enough.
[11:03:07] <BillCriswell> [{... vs {....
[11:03:33] <rhinojs> i'm using { instead of {[
[11:03:48] <rhinojs> can't believe is this detail
[11:04:51] <rhinojs> BillCriswell: the error changed: syntax error 1:1
[11:04:55] * CssNoob good morning and good night y'all
[11:05:01] <cjohnson> paste new code
[11:05:04] <rhinojs> BillCriswell: should i put the object in a variable?
[11:06:16] <rhinojs> BillCriswell: http://pastebin.com/gJXBQ0L8
[11:06:25] <BillCriswell> rhinojs: I'd just try reproducing on jsbin.com.. {[ wouldn't be right in any case.
[11:07:03] <BillCriswell> rhinojs: Ok, so you'd want function (result) {} and you'd loop through result.body
[11:16:54] <BillCriswell> rhinojs: All good?
[11:17:57] <rhinojs> BillCriswell: yes, in the console is returning a perfect object, but still appearing "not-well formed" warning.
[11:19:28] <BillCriswell> rhinojs: I'd hve to see the rest of it. That JSON looks good to me.
[11:19:47] <BillCriswell> JSON lint says so as well.
[11:20:21] <rhinojs> maybe it's the browser, i'm using mozilla developer, it's full of bugs, don't work even addons.
[11:20:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:20:30] <robertmaxrees> use FF developer.
[11:20:36] <robertmaxrees> also: i'm late to the party, but rhinojs you're not trying to parse that JSON are you?
[11:20:44] <robertmaxrees> or is it a string and you should parse it?
[11:20:53] <rhinojs> robertmaxrees: yes man, i'm parsing it
[11:20:59] <robertmaxrees> try not parsing it.
[11:21:05] <rhinojs> ?
[11:21:09] <robertmaxrees> if it's not surrounded in quotes, you don't want to parse it.
[11:21:15] <rhinojs> no, i'm parsing like a object
[11:21:16] <robertmaxrees> JSON.parse(); - try not doing this.
[11:21:19] <rhinojs> data.attribute
[11:21:32] <robertmaxrees> are you using JSON.parse();?
[11:21:50] <rhinojs> robertmaxrees: no
[11:22:02] <rhinojs> i'm getting the result as a normal object
[11:22:21] <robertmaxrees> so you tried to JSON.parse() it?
[11:22:25] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[11:23:03] <rhinojs> robertmaxrees: i'm using jquery
[11:23:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:23:11] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change anything.
[11:23:34] <robertmaxrees> $.getJson(function(data) { console.log(JSON.parse(data)) });
[11:23:44] <robertmaxrees> err, $.getJSON()
[11:24:11] <rhinojs> robertmaxrees: parse is worse than before, the json even don't loads...
[11:24:15] <robertmaxrees> with the URL in there of your data source.
[11:24:48] <robertmaxrees> $.getJson(file, function(data) { console.log(JSON.parse(data)) });
[11:24:54] <robertmaxrees> err, lol my casing is off today
[11:25:09] <BillCriswell> roBErt stop
[11:25:14] <robertmaxrees> yeah i'm giving up
[11:25:34] <BillCriswell> capItaliziNG no fUn
[11:25:43] <BillCriswell> I'm ready for the weekend.
[11:26:50] <rhinojs> I think there's no solution
[11:27:01] <rhinojs> it's just a browser issue.
[11:27:11] <robertmaxrees> did you try in chrome or the FF dev edition?
[11:27:40] <robertmaxrees> because parsing JSON is a simple task and just about every browser does it right.
[11:27:48] <robertmaxrees> i haven't found one that doesn't, in fact.
[11:28:03] <rhinojs> the chromium has another weird error
[11:28:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:28:13] <robertmaxrees> what's that error?
[11:28:44] <BillCriswell> Damn Obama.
[11:29:01] <rhinojs> robertmaxrees: XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///$my_dir. Received an invalid response. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access. test.html:1
[11:29:25] <robertmaxrees> rhinojs are you trying to use $.getJSON() to load a file on your hard drive?
[11:29:36] <rhinojs> robertmaxrees: yes
[11:29:40] <robertmaxrees> you can't do that.
[11:29:44] <robertmaxrees> needs to be through a server.
[11:29:57] <rhinojs> jesus, really?
[11:30:03] <robertmaxrees> errr, yeah..
[11:30:16] <robertmaxrees> imagine if any website loaded whatever file they wanted off your hard drive.
[11:30:16] <rhinojs> i'm tired of this stuff.
[11:30:17] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[11:30:23] <cjohnson> you're tired of security?
[11:30:44] <rhinojs> no, i'm the entire day trying to solve some issues about json loading.
[11:30:56] <rhinojs> this is really boring
[11:30:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:31:01] <cjohnson> give up!
[11:31:09] <robertmaxrees> hey now - don't discourage the dude.
[11:31:42] <robertmaxrees> rhinojs how long have you been working with javascript?
[11:31:56] <rhinojs> robertmaxrees: of course you can load through a local file, the jquery API shows a local example.
[11:32:03] <robertmaxrees> wat
[11:32:03] <rhinojs> 6 months.
[11:32:08] <robertmaxrees> where?
[11:32:15] <robertmaxrees> where are you seeing that example, I mean.
[11:32:37] <robertmaxrees> because using AJAX to load something via a file:// is something your browser tries very hard to prevent.
[11:32:48] <rhinojs> robertmaxrees: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[11:33:16] <robertmaxrees> where?
[11:33:28] <BillCriswell> A relative path is not a local example.
[11:33:33] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:33:51] <rhinojs> can't believe in this
[11:34:01] <robertmaxrees> just setup a simple local dev server.
[11:34:04] <robertmaxrees> easy-peasy
[11:34:26] <rhinojs> i have the problem is not the json load, it's the sync of load json and select data of json
[11:34:42] <robertmaxrees> rhinojs the issue is that you're trying to use ajax to load a file on your hard drive.
[11:34:48] <robertmaxrees> you need to request it to a server.
[11:34:55] <rhinojs> $.getJSON uses ajax?
[11:35:09] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/ - "This is a shorthand Ajax function, which is equivalent to:"
[11:35:13] <BillCriswell> Indeedie it does.
[11:35:24] <rhinojs> robertmaxrees: the problem is file, i did load the json using a local server
[11:35:27] <rhinojs> fine*
[11:35:35] <rhinojs> the problem now is
[11:35:51] <rhinojs> whats the event of document after execute ready, i forgot the name.
[11:36:12] <robertmaxrees> rhinojs the error is that you're loading file://
[11:36:15] <robertmaxrees> that's what that error meant.
[11:36:19] <robertmaxrees> not sure how else to phrase that.
[11:36:43] <rhinojs> robertmaxrees: i did load the json data, i show if you want, trust me
[11:36:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:36:52] <cjohnson> not from file://
[11:36:53] <robertmaxrees> i don't believe you, but OK
[11:37:07] <rhinojs> tell me how i can send you the .rar?
[11:37:14] <rhinojs> i send to yo
[11:37:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:37:48] <robertmaxrees> what server are you using?
[11:37:53] <cjohnson> hahaha
[11:38:47] <devJunk> hhehehe
[11:39:01] <robertmaxrees> rhinojs because the error you showed me says that the issue is that you're trying to load something off your hard drive.
[11:39:04] <rhinojs> robertmaxrees: i'm executing the html file, i tell is it.
[11:39:33] <cjohnson> rhinojs: the answer here, we all assure you, is to just set up a local http server
[11:39:35] <cjohnson> and don't use fil://
[11:39:38] <cjohnson> it only leads to problems
[11:39:44] <cjohnson> as you can see
[11:39:45] <rhinojs> the problem is done
[11:39:50] <rhinojs> please
[11:39:52] <robertmaxrees> wat
[11:39:52] <rhinojs> i have another
[11:39:57] <cjohnson> hahaha
[11:40:09] <rhinojs> what's the event which executes after ready of document?
[11:40:47] <cjohnson> well there's onload?
[11:40:54] <cjohnson> but your question is vague
[11:41:07] <robertmaxrees> rhinojs that's not going to fix your problem.
[11:41:12] <robertmaxrees> you need a webserver
[11:43:07] <rhinojs> cjohnson: $(document).load(function(){});?
[11:45:55] <BillCriswell> later duddudududes
[12:03:47] <pdcmoreira> guys, how do i select all children except the first?
[12:04:04] <pdcmoreira> i want to do element.empty() except the first children
[12:04:20] <cjohnson> you could use like :not(:first-child) maybe?
[12:04:30] <cjohnson> or Array.slice if you already have the collection
[12:05:06] <pdcmoreira> so element.find(':not(:first-child)')
[12:05:09] <pdcmoreira> does this work?
[12:05:16] <pdcmoreira> i have the container div
[12:05:21] <pdcmoreira> as a jquery object
[12:08:39] <pdcmoreira> wow
[12:09:26] <pdcmoreira> so i have a div and 2 divs inside
[12:09:44] <pdcmoreira> no
[12:10:05] <pdcmoreira> i have a div and another div inside it and two divs inside this one
[12:10:18] <pdcmoreira> so 1div -> 1div -> 2 divs
[12:10:22] <pdcmoreira> (nested)
[12:10:45] <pdcmoreira> and i do divContactosSemEmail.find(':not(:first-child)')
[12:10:53] <pdcmoreira> and it gets the first of those 2divs
[12:10:55] <pdcmoreira> :s
[12:11:22] <cjohnson> jsfiddle your structure please
[12:11:29] <cjohnson> not sure exactly what you want
[12:11:50] <pdcmoreira> yeah ok, maybe in an hour or so
[12:11:57] <pdcmoreira> need to go do a thing now
[12:12:02] <pdcmoreira> brb
[12:12:22] <Prometheian> Can I pass my $(function({})) scope into a $.getScript?
[12:13:41] <cjohnson> you can't pass the whole scope but if you called $.getScript from within that scope
[12:13:46] <cjohnson> it has access to the variables declared there
[12:15:56] <Prometheian> It doesn't seem to be working that way :/
[12:17:25] <cjohnson> paste your code...
[12:17:29] <Prometheian> kk
[12:17:49] <cjohnson> wait, I'm sorry I misinterpreted
[12:17:58] <cjohnson> you want the JS that .getScript loads to have access to that scope?
[12:18:11] <cjohnson> that won't happen. you'll have to give it access explicitly somehow
[12:18:25] <cjohnson> it gets loaded as any other <script> tag gets loaded, in the global scope only
[12:19:35] <Prometheian> Ah, is there an easy way to give it scope access, or will it require some fudging?
[12:20:41] <cjohnson> nope that's not how scope works, you'll need to explicitly grant access to whatever you're trying to expose
[12:21:17] <cjohnson> if your code were more module-like you could use requirejs and include it within that scope block
[12:21:28] <cjohnson> but then again I suspect the lack of modularity is the problem in the first place
[12:53:14] <bencc> is there a plugin to localized duration?
[12:53:18] <bencc> (date1 - date2) will give something like "3 hours and 23 mintues" but in different languages
[12:55:04] <_rgn> check moment.js
[12:55:28] <bencc> _rgn: doesn't localize time difference
[12:55:42] <_rgn> ok, nevermind then
[13:19:55] <Guest96392> hi, can anyone suggest a plugin to read .ics (icalendar) files?
[13:23:19] <shodan45> how can I get partial content of a long-running ajax request?
[13:23:44] <robertmaxrees> something like http://oboejs.com/
[13:25:24] <shodan45> robertmaxrees: (assuming that was meant for me...) that looks much more complicated than what I want
[13:25:54] <shodan45> I just want what browsers already do - partial rendering of documents as they come in
[13:26:21] <shodan45> except inside a jquery ui dialog
[13:32:42] <shodan45> nm, this seems way too complicated... I'll just hack it with an iframe
[13:36:12] <robertmaxrees> shodan45 sorry was handling some stuff at work.
[14:43:09] <bencc> is the browser clock reliable?
[14:43:15] <bencc> or should I load the time from the server?
[14:43:22] <robertmaxrees> depends on what exactly you need.
[14:45:18] <robertmaxrees> and how you define "reliable"
[14:49:43] <madprops> is bind still used or is deprecated?
[14:50:20] <robertmaxrees> .on() is preferred
[14:51:41] <robertmaxrees> madprops
[14:51:58] <madprops> ok thanks
[14:53:02] <bencc> robertmaxrees: I want to allow the user to enter another page only when the time is XXX
[14:53:19] <robertmaxrees> bencc you can change your local clock to work around that.
[14:53:27] <robertmaxrees> could use both.
[14:54:02] <bencc> robertmaxrees: the server will protect against that. I guess the client clock is not reliable
[14:54:12] <bencc> I don't won't the client being blocked because of the clock
[14:54:18] <bencc> I'll send the time from the server
[14:54:31] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[15:02:43] <alexclark> is there a way to force my browser to focus on an element?
[15:03:06] <Snerf> click on it :)
[15:03:28] <alexclark> Snerf: its a hidden search form
[15:03:31] <robertmaxrees> .focus()
[15:03:45] <alexclark> click on the icon and then it focuses on the now shown field
[15:03:47] <Snerf> ya, not sure if .focus works on a hidden item
[15:03:58] <robertmaxrees> "Attempting to set focus to a hidden element causes an error in Internet Explorer. Take care to only use .focus() on elements that are visible. To run an element's focus event handlers without setting focus to the element, use .triggerHandler( "focus" ) instead of .focus()."
[15:05:14] <alexclark> Snerf: robertmaxrees: I am not a smart man.  I was trying on the button, not the field
[15:05:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:05:26] <robertmaxrees> oooh hahaha
[15:05:34] <Snerf> a hidden button ?
[15:05:46] <alexclark> thanks for being a sanity checker/aligner
[15:05:50] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[15:05:56] <alexclark> the button hides and shows a form
[15:06:23] <alexclark> so i want to click the button and be focused on the form that has appeared
[15:06:35] <robertmaxrees> eeeh, don't do that.
[15:06:42] <alexclark> why not?
[15:06:51] <Snerf> why would you do that?
[15:07:05] <robertmaxrees> create a function you can explicitly call instead.
[15:07:22] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're routing behavior through events.
[15:10:17] <alexclark> its for a client that requested it and its just a marketing site
[15:10:45] <robertmaxrees> you'll also have issues with IE>
[15:10:47] <robertmaxrees> is there already an event listener on the form
[15:10:48] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:11:53] <alexclark> robertmaxrees: yeah one on focus hahaha
[15:12:11] <robertmaxrees> alexclark easy then - abstract that code out and explicitly call it instead.
[15:12:12] <alexclark> if I end up doing this ill just remove that one
[15:12:35] <alexclark> but that just replaces the placeholder
[15:12:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:12:50] <alexclark> which is stupid, ughhh
[15:12:52] <robertmaxrees> the idea is to not .trigger() events in the browser whenever possible.
[15:13:13] <alexclark> from a maintainability standpoint?
[15:13:23] <robertmaxrees> and a sanity standpoint.
[15:13:45] <robertmaxrees> as well as a cross-browser standpoint :)
[15:14:00] <alexclark> does trigger not work at all in old IE?
[15:14:49] <robertmaxrees> focus on hidden elements is a problem for IE
[15:15:05] <robertmaxrees> and using events as a router for calling stuff really isn't generally a good idea.
[15:15:19] <robertmaxrees> it's fragile and painful to work with.  abstract out your code and explicitly call it instead.
[15:15:27] <robertmaxrees> much faster and far fewer headachjes
[15:16:36] <alexclark> ok, well working with it im not too concerned with because its just a marketing site ill probably never touch again
[15:16:54] <robertmaxrees> do it for the next dev at least.
[15:16:57] <madprops> if I do a player.bind(something, function(){ // can i reference player like $(this) ? })
[15:17:07] <alexclark> and i think the ie thing is fine, because im showing the field before i call focus
[15:17:08] <robertmaxrees> madprops use .on()
[15:17:12] <madprops> i did
[15:17:14] <madprops> and it didn't work
[15:17:17] <madprops> it only worked with bind
[15:17:19] <robertmaxrees> madprops then you have another problem.
[15:17:26] <robertmaxrees> madprops is something an event?
[15:17:31] <madprops> yes
[15:17:41] <madprops> SC.Widget.Events.PLAY
[15:17:42] <robertmaxrees> what version of JQ are you on?
[15:18:01] <madprops> 2.1.1
[15:18:07] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make any sense then.
[15:18:14] <robertmaxrees> can you share your code?
[15:19:12] <madprops> http://pastebin.com/eduU1Q77
[15:19:57] <madprops> back back to my original question
[15:20:01] <madprops> would $(this) work
[15:20:10] <robertmaxrees> err.
[15:20:36] <madprops> or
[15:20:37] <robertmaxrees> you need to pass a string, not an object.
[15:20:39] <madprops> how do i pass it
[15:20:44] <robertmaxrees> but yes, $(this) is the element
[15:21:04] <madprops> how would i pass that as a string
[15:21:10] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[15:21:25] <madprops> so bind is ok then
[15:21:33] <robertmaxrees> bind expects one, as well.
[15:21:57] <robertmaxrees> something seems really unusual here
[15:22:20] <robertmaxrees> pull your event binding out of that .each() and do it separately.
[17:08:20] <OnceMe> Why to use AngularJS? I can just use jQuery...??
[17:09:30] <snover> if you have to ask…
[17:09:40] <OnceMe> well Yes
[17:09:56] <OnceMe> will AngularJS automatically update a DOM on page, if that element is changed in database?
[17:10:07] <OnceMe> I mean is it like a constant connection between db and DOM or not?
[17:10:14] <OnceMe> Like I do it with ajax in jQuery..?
[17:10:50] <cjohnson> ajax isn't constant
[17:11:02] <cjohnson> it generally is used for that type of thing though yes
[17:11:09] <cjohnson> (angular)
[17:11:12] <OnceMe> Yes ajax is not constant
[17:11:18] <OnceMe> my question is, is angular constant
[17:11:22] <OnceMe> aside from MVC approach
[17:13:01] <cjohnson> I don't see what those two have to do with each other
[17:13:50] <OnceMe> whats angular used for?
[17:13:54] <OnceMe> I only knew for jQuery
[17:13:59] <OnceMe> and thought jQuery is the best
[17:14:18] <cjohnson> read about it https://angularjs.org/
[17:14:29] <cjohnson> http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/197599/why-would-i-use-angular
[17:34:24] <starsinmypockets> Is it possible to detect a change in the length of a list, and trigger an event...
[17:34:52] <starsinmypockets> $('ul#mine').on('itsLonger', function (e) { ... });
[17:37:39] <stephen> e.type == "dream"
[17:49:41] <cjohnson> lol
[17:49:55] <cjohnson> starsinmypockets: make the code that changes the list trigger an event on the list
[17:50:05] <cjohnson> $('ul#mine').trigger('changed');
[17:50:09] <cjohnson> and then listen for the event
[17:50:40] <starsinmypockets> cjohnson - well, It's a response to the select2 which loads a selection via ajax... just can't figure out the event fired there..
[17:50:56] <starsinmypockets> So trying to cheat :P
[17:54:14] <cjohnson> the "select2-loaded" event isn't useful?
[17:54:25] <cjohnson> Fired when query function is done loading the data and the results list has been updated
[17:55:08] <cjohnson> very bottom of the page: http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/#documentation
[18:42:08] <starsinmypockets> cjohnson - I'm look for the selected event, when a tag is added to the input from the returned ajax list..
[18:50:14] <cjohnson> that's listed on the documentation as well, starsinmypockets
[18:50:40] <starsinmypockets> yeah looks like 'change'
[19:11:58] <RabSimpson> hi folks, i'm trying to add .sticky to nav.page-top div.primary on http://dominoletting.gocircles.co.uk/?bypass=1 (using sticky.js) but it's not working. i got the js from http://css-tricks.com/forums/topic/fixed-menu-bar/. adding the class directly achieves the desired effect, but i need it to kick in once the page is scrolled to the top of the element. any ideas?
[19:16:02] <RabSimpson> i just noticed that the quotes are wrong
[19:33:50] <bowenac> does index() retain its value?
[19:34:49] <bowenac> I seem to be having an issue on a lightbox type popup gallery I am working on where after the first time you open the gallery and then close it. The next time you click through it skips an image, then the next time its skips two, and then three etc
[19:45:02] <wa5ted> somehwere you are using index+1
[19:45:08] <wa5ted> i  suggest you use .next
[19:45:12] <wa5ted> bowenac: ^
[19:45:14] <wa5ted> somehow
[19:45:28] <bowenac> var i = jQuery(this).parent('.thumbnail').index() + 1;
[19:45:31] <bowenac> I am
[19:45:33] <bowenac> lol
[19:45:56] <wa5ted> there you go
[19:46:07] <wa5ted> use .next().index()
[19:46:09] <bowenac> which works the first time you open it, but then each time you open the popup again it is incremented by the count of each time its been open
[19:48:58] <bowenac> does same thing but breaks my counter once it hits the end causes it to be -1 instead of say 10 items once its on the 10th
[20:19:02] <bowenac> ended up being my click event
[20:19:11] <bowenac> not sure why but delegate was causing it
[20:19:24] <bowenac> .on( "click", worked
[23:12:13] <Noor_egy> hello i have question  , if i used iframe that have webpage can i access it and all its elements and do what i want like add menu and other things ??from the parent page ??

[23:39:49] <kiki67100> I have a simple question, when i load a script in HTML page and the script who load have HTTP redirect browser will load it ?
