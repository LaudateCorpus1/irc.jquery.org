[01:15:12] <Northwoodss> Is there a good tooltip where i can show information from ajax call
[01:15:41] <robertmaxrees> should be pretty straightforward to setup most tooltip libraries to do that.
[01:17:31] <Northwoodss> robertmaxrees, some with good design , can you suggest ?
[01:17:48] <robertmaxrees> simple google search should show you plenty of options :)
[01:17:56] <robertmaxrees> are you using bootstrap?
[01:18:03] <robertmaxrees> if so, i think there's one they offer.
[01:18:09] <robertmaxrees> if not, plenty of choices.
[01:18:40] <Northwoodss> robertmaxrees, problem is , the tooltip is actually small in size
[01:18:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[01:18:52] <Northwoodss> i need kind of more data to display , like one row
[01:19:00] <Northwoodss> email , name , phone number
[01:19:04] <Northwoodss> upon clicking an element
[01:19:17] <robertmaxrees> what does that change about what I suggested? :)
[01:19:50] <Northwoodss> :)\
[01:19:53] <Northwoodss> nothing
[01:19:54] <Northwoodss> lol
