[05:13:56] <dw1> wrong channel :P
[06:16:09] <bestdesign10> https://jsfiddle.net/bp5crndj/1/ <<-- how to check if last field is filled and then only display alert?
[06:17:14] <dw1> put an id attribute on it to make it easier
[06:17:53] <bestdesign10> for input an id? but there is no way to select with last?
[06:18:04] <bestdesign10> .last() ?
[06:18:10] <dw1> yea you can
[06:18:15] <dw1> it's val() though not value()
[06:18:44] <dw1> looks right otherwise
[06:18:58] <dw1> other than
[06:19:02] <dw1> it should be if(!
[06:19:10] <bestdesign10> dw1: https://jsfiddle.net/bp5crndj/2/
[06:19:22] <dw1> oh you want it filled
[06:19:22] <dw1> nm
[06:19:50] <dw1> you dont need the !== ''
[06:19:54] <dw1> any value is 'truthy'
[06:20:11] <dw1> and yeah, works
[06:26:32] <bestdesign10> dw1: i want to not be filled then alert thats why use !== i think btw what advantage ose if(! or on !== is not matter?
[06:27:41] <bestdesign10> is do about same not?
[06:33:22] <dw1> its the same yea
[06:33:42] <dw1> works the same, anyway
[07:35:58] <bestdesign10> dw1: thank you so much
[07:39:35] <dw1> sure np
[10:10:17] <haroldjfks> hello, I have more youtube embeds in iframes on a page...when I click on play for one video, I would like others to stop, how would you do it, please?
[10:11:08] <haroldjfks> I added enablejsapi=1 for iframes but I'm not able to stop the other videos on the page...
[10:11:26] <haroldjfks> so, just one at a time needs to play...
[10:12:35] <dw1> see https://stackoverflow.com/a/15165166 & comments maybe
[10:12:36] <dw1> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[13:19:56] <codecutter> i have a link with a 'mouseenter' event attached , which displays the tooltip container by setting css prop to 'display: block',  'mouseleave' on the same link causes the tooltip to close. I want to prevent that tooltip from  closing if the cursor is on top of the tooltip (i move the cursor from a link to tooltip container with setTimeout). How do I check to ensure the tooltip is closes if an only if both conditions are
[13:19:56] <codecutter>  true i.e. cursor is no longer on the link and tooltip.
[13:20:57] <codecutter> to close the tooltip i simply set the css prop 'display: none'
[13:21:49] <dw1> have you tried showing the tooltip with the proper function
[13:22:24] <dw1> with popper
[13:23:46] <dw1> prob a lot easier
[13:24:11] <dw1> otherwise youd have to record when youre on the tooltip and cancel the mouseleave event
[13:24:17] <dw1> and add a mouseleave event to the tooltip
[13:24:27] <dw1> or something
[13:25:06] <codecutter> i'm using popperjs , yes
[13:25:21] <dw1> i imagine it has that feature built in
[13:25:30] <codecutter> really?
[13:25:40] <dw1> if you initialize the tooltip the usual way, not with modifying properties
[13:26:06] <codecutter> how would popper know when to display a tooltip?
[13:26:13] <codecutter> and when to close tooltip?
[13:26:16] <dw1> are you using bootstrap too
[13:26:37] <dw1> https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/tooltips/
[13:26:40] <codecutter> no,
[13:26:41] <codecutter> https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/tutorial/
[13:26:41] <dw1> oh
[13:26:45] <codecutter> scrolldown
[13:27:01] <codecutter> it's using mouseenter and mouseleave
[13:29:15] <dw1> https://github.com/popperjs/popper-core/issues/669
[13:34:37] <codecutter> I'm using the approach shown in the tutorial above i.e. crearePopper()
[13:35:44] <dw1> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/xJvLOY?editors=0110
[13:35:54] <dw1> the example from that issue seems a good way to do it
[13:36:00] <dw1> put the code in template
[13:36:10] <dw1> i guess that makes it not close on tooltip hover
[13:36:38] <dw1> otherwise you have to code it manually
[13:36:53] <dw1> to cancel the closure if hovering the tip
[13:37:37] <dw1> and then bind leaving the tip and cancel closing it if back on the link
[13:37:38] <codecutter> https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/
[13:38:10] <codecutter> i need tippjs :)
[13:38:16] <codecutter> tippyjs
[13:39:02] <dw1> looks nice
[13:39:14] <dw1> interactive mode eh
[13:39:35] <codecutter> :)
[16:05:44] <codecutter> dw1: u there?
[16:06:44] <codecutter> https://jsfiddle.net/pc9qkraj/
[16:07:46] <codecutter> i need the tooltip to only close if the cursor is not hovering of the button or the toooltip itself, if either one of them is true then remain visible
[16:08:49] <codecutter> tippy's nteractive mode requires that tooltip to be a child of target (i need it to be in body)
[16:14:47] <Jase> why does it need to be in body?
[16:17:53] <codecutter> have my reasons
[16:19:29] <Jase> No problem you are gonna have a hard time managing "tooltip" like  events like that. Your choice.
[16:21:36] <codecutter> any suggestions?
[16:26:28] <codecutter> i will have a lot of tooltips on the page - every buttons/link has its own tooltip (identified unique id).
[16:28:53] <codecutter> I am creating tooltips dynamically and appending it to the dom when a lik is hovered.  if i can I would prefer mess would element themselve and places all tooltips in the body/
[16:28:58] <codecutter> make sense?
[16:29:16] <codecutter> link*
[16:29:25] <codecutter> not mess*
[16:30:21] <codecutter> i pretty much have all working, this is the last hurdle
[16:30:29] <codecutter> it*
[16:32:26] <Jase> Maybe you should just have one tooltip.
[16:32:43] <Jase> That you populate with data from each link.
[16:32:58] <Jase> This ensures that you don't ever have more than one open at atime.
[16:33:45] <Jase> You could store the tooltip info in a data-attribute or the title attribute and then just show it when you need it.
[16:34:55] <Jase> Then you don't have to manage IDs for everything. Anything you wan tto have a tooltip, just include the data in the element and give it a class. That allows you to search for the class and handle tooltip events for that class.
[16:36:27] <codecutter> that will require the tooltip to be in the body element, it can't be inside the target element becuase its agnostic, right?
[16:37:11] <codecutter> when the tooltip is initially displayed, it has shows a loader - ajax is made in the background to retrieve and populate
[16:37:16] <Jase> YOu would append it to the element where you needed it
[16:37:34] <Jase> that way, if they mouse over to the tooltip, you don't get a mouseout event
[16:37:53] <Jase> allowing them to move the tooltip manually or close it, for example.
[16:37:54] <codecutter> that would work but i have already wrote teh code
[16:38:15] <codecutter> above is the last hurdle
[16:40:14] <Jase> That's the problem. If you have the tooltip in the body element, then the user can't interact with it
[16:40:51] <Jase> where is your code?
[16:41:26] <codecutter> alot of it is custom framework pecific
[16:41:31] <codecutter> specific*
[16:42:48] <codecutter> would it be possible to animate the tooltip? is slidedown?
[16:43:24] <codecutter> or fadein
[16:43:27] <Jase> THe only thing I can think of, which is ugly beyond compare, is if you had a separate mouse event listener for the tooltip element and delay after you moused out of the trigger element
[16:43:34] <Jase> all of that is super easy with css
[16:43:45] <codecutter> can i see it
[16:43:57] <Jase> one second
[17:06:30] <Jase> sorry, had a call come in. Here'a an ugly example: https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/MWaVZgy
[17:10:41] <codecutter> is this using the popperjs lib like in my example?
[17:11:08] <codecutter> its not...
[17:12:58] <codecutter> its not possible to animate the example in the fiddle a pasted, right?
[17:24:02] <Jase> https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/05myq1x4/1/
[17:39:56] <Jase> that's your example that you pasted
[21:19:43] <Jase> anybody know for sure when you have multiple selectors in your jquery object, do the returned elements go in order they appear in the dom, or do they first go my matched selector then by order?
