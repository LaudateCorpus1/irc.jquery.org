[00:30:52] <SpecialTech> linurandy you gotta ask the question about datatable, im sure there's tons of people, like myself who have worked with it.
[01:02:11] <linurandy> hello i need anybody that know about a datable plugin
[01:02:15] <linurandy> there is the code
[01:02:42] <linurandy> recordsTotal 1

[01:29:21] <Robdgreat> it can sometimes disincline people from wanting to help you
[03:01:21] <deepy> linurandy: use jsfiddle.net och jsbin.com to show what you mean
[06:11:18] <linurandy> hello
[06:11:44] <linurandy> everyone i need you take a look to this https://jsbin.com/simepiy/edit?html,js,console,output
[06:12:32] <linurandy> but when i do it in my page don't show it
[06:15:44] <jak2000> hi all
[06:16:34] <jak2000> i have this event:  $(document).on("change", "#selTipoProducto", function () {      when i execute: $('#selTipoProducto').trigger("change");   not fire the event? thanks
[06:18:53] <localh0st> jak2000: fiddle
[07:54:30] <Nece228> hey, how can i draw two lines with google charts?
[07:54:31] <Nece228> https://jsfiddle.net/e3n7w4jk/3/
[07:55:14] <Nece228> sorry, this one: https://jsfiddle.net/e3n7w4jk/2/
[07:57:07] <Nece228> it works fine with using two elements (graph-col-live-customers and .graph-col-go-live-date), but now i want to add graph-col-country which is supposed to be displaying the country in a different line (dk, se, no, fi should have their own lines)
[08:13:49] <Cork> Nece228: you mean have multiple areas in the same graph?
[08:14:01] <Nece228> Cork: yeah
[08:15:19] <Cork> Nece228: https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/areachart
[08:15:24] <Nece228> rather than showing all of the customers, i want to divide them for each country
[08:16:13] <Nece228> Cork: thanks i checked that out, but im not sure how to sort my arrays to do that
[08:16:38] <Cork> Nece228: the cart expects an array with arrays
[08:16:46] <Cork> just add a second value in the inner array
[08:21:03] <Nece228> Cork: thats what is done, i have value2
[08:22:31] <Cork> Nece228: $.map can't give you three values
[08:22:59] <Cork> Nece228: so the array structure doesn't look correct
[08:23:20] <Nece228> Cork: yes, and that is my problem, how can i restructure it
[08:23:56] <Cork> it should be [[ 'datapoint', 'area1', 'area2' ], [ 'datapoint2', 'area1', 'area2' ]]
[09:14:09] <adithya> i'm using jquery 3.1.1 and the plugin jquery datatables and im getting an error "Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'length'"
[09:14:20] <adithya> anybody face this issue?
[09:14:42] <adithya> please help!
[09:15:56] <adithya> anybody there?
[09:15:59] <adithya> clear
[09:27:43] <Nece228> Cork: how can i do that?
[09:28:00] <Cork> so what?
[09:34:31] <Nece228> Cork: hmm, i cant figure a way to do the array in your specified way
[09:39:16] <Cork> Nece228: you can't make it as two separate loops as you're doing
[09:39:31] <Cork> as they will always generate separate arrays
[09:39:58] <Cork> you can loop the first and grab the same position from the second and then create the merged array
[09:40:06] <Cork> or just don't use stuff and build the array directly
[09:50:58] <Nece228> Cork: how to grab the same position from the second one?
[09:51:15] <Cork> depends on how you build it
[09:51:30] <Cork> you could loop the first array, and then grab the index offset from the second array
[09:53:19] <localh0st> Cork: I'm impressed by your patience ;)
[09:53:53] <Cork> localh0st: practice :)
[09:55:25] <localh0st> Cork: practice in being patient?
[09:55:41] <Nece228> lol true, thanks a lot for help!
[09:55:51] <Cork> in just giving a hand in learning and solving problems
[09:56:03] <Nece228> its just really hard for me to imagine how to do that
[10:31:03] <poboy> so I'm too stupid to figure this out.  https://kopy.io/NoGNS  I want #bkDebtors_ to display the name but pass in a variable DebtorID.
[10:31:47] <poboy> I think it's this line I need to tweak?  $("#bkDebtors_"+id).append($('<option></option>').attr('value', value).text(debtor));
[10:32:17] <Cork> poboy: that should generate the correct option
[10:32:54] <Cork> though you have made it over complicated. just do append($('<option>', { value: value, text: debtor }))
[10:39:02] <linurandy> i need something take a look to my error on this page and tell me what is the error: https://datatables.net/forums/discussion/comment/119096#Comment_119096
[11:18:24] <kernel_panic_ar> hi
[11:18:31] <kernel_panic_ar> somebody have used select2?
[11:47:05] <kbni> watup
[12:31:03] <guideX> is there a way to count the number of elements with a value in jqueryy without loop?
[12:31:21] <guideX> $(".myclass").hasvalue().length or something
[12:32:26] <taplar_> $('.myclass').filter(function(){ returh this.value !== ''; }).length
[12:32:35] <taplar_> *return
[12:33:47] <guideX> oh wow cool, thanks
[12:33:55] <guideX> never heard of filter before
[12:34:15] <taplar_> filter is like find, however find looks for children
[12:34:23] <taplar_> filter operates upon what you've already found
[12:35:32] <taplar_> var $people = $('.men, .women, .children');  $people.filter('.men').addClass('red');  $people.filter('.women').addClass('blue');
[12:35:38] <taplar_> dummy example of another use case
[13:08:52] <randymarsh9> hey guys
[13:09:03] <robertmaxrees> good morning.
[13:09:13] <randymarsh9> is there a way to prevent the green box from moving up when i rapidly click on the red box?
[13:09:18] <randymarsh9> https://jsfiddle.net/gxoofjxe/
[13:10:07] <randymarsh9> i know it moves because it's doing a display:none with the fadeIn but i'm wondering how i can workaround this
[13:10:18] <taplar_> do you ever want the green box to move up?
[13:10:22] <randymarsh9> no
[13:10:33] <taplar_> so put a wrapper around the red box with a min-height
[13:10:34] <robertmaxrees> alternatively: why use jquery and not css aniamtions on opacity?
[13:10:48] <randymarsh9> jquery is easier for me lol
[13:11:00] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:11:01] <randymarsh9> but actually you're right, if i do css
[13:11:08] <randymarsh9> then it never does a display:none..
[13:11:12] <randymarsh9> hm
[13:11:18] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to hide the element.
[13:11:26] <robertmaxrees> you want to fade it out and then immediately back in.
[13:11:47] <randymarsh9> i don't want to fade it out though
[13:11:51] <randymarsh9> i want it to 'blink'
[13:12:03] <randymarsh9> fadeout takes too long so i hide it
[13:12:09] <robertmaxrees> not a slow fade.
[13:12:10] <robertmaxrees> sorry.
[13:12:26] <robertmaxrees> you immediately want it to be entirely transparent and then fade itr.
[13:12:27] <randymarsh9> oh
[13:12:27] <robertmaxrees> *in
[13:12:31] <randymarsh9> yes
[13:12:59] <randymarsh9> so.. change opacity then slowly transition using css?
[13:13:26] <robertmaxrees> that'd be my suggestion.,
[13:15:06] <taplar_> https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/ has a built in fadeIn that sounds like what you want
[13:21:51] <randymarsh9> +1
[13:21:55] <randymarsh9> i'll learn css instead lol
[13:21:58] <randymarsh9> thanks guys
[13:24:06] <taplar_> https://github.com/daneden/animate.css/blob/master/source/fading_entrances/fadeIn.css
[13:30:12] <sztelke> hello
[13:30:29] <randymarsh9> taplar_: i'm terrible with css, how do i call that
[13:30:33] <randymarsh9> .addclass() ?
[13:31:24] <taplar_> .addClass
[13:31:25] <taplar_> yeah
[13:34:03] <randymarsh9> cool let me try
[13:35:19] <sztelke> in $.ajax can I fire an error if request is blocked by cross-origin policy or in this case jQuery/js doesnt get any error from the browser?
[13:36:14] <robertmaxrees> does .catch() not do anything?
[13:39:15] <randymarsh9> it does
[13:39:22] <randymarsh9> robert helped me with same problem
[13:39:34] <randymarsh9> do .then() for success followed by .catch() for your error
[13:39:48] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:39:52] <sztelke> oh
[13:40:03] <robertmaxrees> sztelke tho i'd fix the cross-origin issue.
[13:40:09] <sztelke> such a newb
[13:40:16] <robertmaxrees> nah - just didn't know :)
[13:40:18] <sztelke> yeah, thanks
[13:43:38] <randymarsh9> taplar_: doesn't seem to be doing anything, is my syntax okay?
[13:43:42] <randymarsh9> https://jsfiddle.net/gxoofjxe/1/
[13:44:58] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 you need to set to completely transparent first.
[13:45:02] <robertmaxrees> then fade it in.
[13:46:12] <randymarsh9> ok 1 sec
[13:47:03] <kernel_panic_ar> hi
[13:47:10] <kernel_panic_ar> someone used select2?
[13:47:29] <robertmaxrees> kernel_panic_ar if you have a questiuon, just ask.  if somebody can help, they will :)
[13:48:12] <kernel_panic_ar> ahh perfect
[13:48:47] <kernel_panic_ar> I want to change the text, from the select2-result
[13:49:15] <kernel_panic_ar> i want to capitalize only the first word of the text
[13:50:44] <robertmaxrees> can you show us what you've got in a fiddle?
[13:51:02] <kernel_panic_ar> is the default behavior of select2
[13:51:50] <kernel_panic_ar> i mean the select box values are always like:
[13:51:52] <kernel_panic_ar> Value One
[13:51:55] <kernel_panic_ar> Value Two
[13:51:57] <kernel_panic_ar> i want:
[13:51:59] <kernel_panic_ar> Value one
[13:52:03] <kernel_panic_ar> Value two
[13:55:49] <randymarsh9> okay this is what i have so far
[13:55:53] <randymarsh9> https://jsfiddle.net/gxoofjxe/2/
[13:56:40] <randymarsh9> should i be using a class to set the opacity to 0 instead of .css() ?
[13:57:25] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[13:57:35] <randymarsh9> ok let me try
[13:58:55] <randymarsh9> does the same thing
[13:58:58] <randymarsh9> https://jsfiddle.net/gxoofjxe/3/
[14:01:05] <randymarsh9> anyone else having issues with jsfiddle today?
[14:01:16] <randymarsh9> getting weird gateway errors..
[14:02:42] <randymarsh9> taplar_: shouldn't my fiddle work?
[14:03:43] <taplar_> looking
[14:04:26] <randymarsh9> maybe
[14:04:30] <randymarsh9> missing the transition property?
[14:05:05] <randymarsh9> err nvm that's probably what the @keyframes is for
[14:05:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gxoofjxe/4/
[14:05:36] <robertmaxrees> something like this.
[14:06:03] <robertmaxrees> my bad.
[14:06:50] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/gxoofjxe/5/
[14:06:58] <taplar_> needed the animation-duratoin
[14:07:19] <taplar_> probably should go down in the other part though
[14:07:40] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/gxoofjxe/6/
[14:08:01] <randymarsh9> ah so it was working but probably happening instantly right?
[14:08:14] <taplar_> yep
[14:08:23] <randymarsh9> cool
[14:09:08] <grapheti> shorthand! - animation: fadeIn 1s;
[14:09:16] <taplar_> ya
[14:09:19] <robertmaxrees> like my fiddle shows >.>
[14:09:24] <grapheti> :D
[14:13:06] <randymarsh9> yea that's already closer to what i'm trying to do but still behaves funny if i click too fast
[14:13:13] <randymarsh9> this gives me something to go off now though
[14:13:15] <randymarsh9> thanks guys
[14:18:19] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gxoofjxe/7/
[14:19:58] <taplar_> what's with the trailing .promise() ?
[14:20:22] <taplar_> or were you planning on doing a then() ?
[14:20:40] <robertmaxrees> ^ i was playing around.  m'bad.
[14:22:22] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: cool that works great!
[14:22:40] <randymarsh9> does jquery "stack" classes?
[14:22:51] <robertmaxrees> "stack"?
[14:22:52] <randymarsh9> like if i try to add the same class too many times or does it check first
[14:22:57] <robertmaxrees> it checks first.
[14:23:03] <randymarsh9> ok just wondering
[15:32:27] * taplar_ learned something today
[15:33:09] <taplar_> never used the xhr.withCredentials before
[15:59:48] <randymarsh9> your guys fadeIn code works better than the one posted here
[15:59:53] <randymarsh9> https://github.com/daneden/animate.css/blob/master/source/fading_entrances/fadeIn.css
[16:00:26] <randymarsh9> they are missing the "animation: fadeIn 2s;" from the fadeIn class
[16:00:37] <randymarsh9> is there a way to add it to their page?
[16:00:48] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[16:01:08] <randymarsh9> i'm new to github so i'm not sure how it works
[16:01:09] <robertmaxrees> did you confirm theirs doesn't work at all?
[16:01:19] <randymarsh9> but if you have an imporvement is it possible to add it to the page?
[16:01:44] <randymarsh9> didn't work when i tried it
[16:02:10] <robertmaxrees> first off.
[16:02:15] <robertmaxrees> did you pull down their repo and test in context?
[16:02:22] <randymarsh9> oh, no lol
[16:02:25] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:02:29] <robertmaxrees> so that's the first thing you'd do.
[16:02:39] <robertmaxrees> if not, you submit a pull request for them to merge in.
[16:03:05] <randymarsh9> how do i pull their repo
[16:03:17] <robertmaxrees> you clone it.
[16:03:32] <randymarsh9> ah ok
[16:03:58] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/daneden/animate.css#installation
[16:04:00] <robertmaxrees> or do this.
[16:04:04] <robertmaxrees> and see if the bug is still present.
[16:04:10] <randymarsh9> probably works with whatever they have going on there then, thought it was just 1 file lol
[16:09:16] <robertmaxrees> if you look at https://github.com/daneden/animate.css#basic-usage, you'll see one line mentions "Add the class animated to the element you want to animate"
[16:09:22] <robertmaxrees> and then "Finally you need to add one of the following classes:"
[16:09:43] <robertmaxrees> looking at the compiled source, you'll see this: https://github.com/daneden/animate.css/blob/master/animate.css#L11-L14
[16:10:24] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 ^
[16:16:27] <robertmaxrees> welp
[16:17:23] <randymarsh9> there it is
[16:18:22] * robertmaxrees sings "woomp there it is"
[16:19:02] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWPbFZywfbs
[16:28:40] <randymarsh9> hey robert
[16:28:53] <randymarsh9> i found another way to fix the clicking thing
[16:29:06] <randymarsh9> what do you think of this
[16:29:08] <randymarsh9> https://jsfiddle.net/gxoofjxe/9/
[16:29:53] <robertmaxrees> i prefer to not juggle event handlers.
[16:30:06] <randymarsh9> so it's overkill huh
[16:30:09] <randymarsh9> i think you're right lol
[16:30:22] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't call it overkill.
[16:30:33] <robertmaxrees> just kind of strange imo.
[16:30:52] <robertmaxrees> leave the handler alone - don't incur that overhead if you don't need to.
[16:31:09] <robertmaxrees> also: there a reason you're not calling $('#box') once and storing the result?
[16:31:24] <taplar_> they have a duration set in the _base.css i believe
[16:31:36] <taplar_> woah.... ha ha, i was scrolled up
[16:31:42] <robertmaxrees> heh ;)
[16:31:59] <taplar_> herp derp derp
[16:35:12] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/gxoofjxe/10/
[16:36:20] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: the reason i'm doing it like this is because pointer-events property makes the hand disappear
[16:36:25] <randymarsh9> https://jsfiddle.net/gxoofjxe/11/
[16:36:35] <randymarsh9> when i click the red box
[16:36:45] <robertmaxrees> but it's not interactive
[16:37:10] <randymarsh9> what do you mean
[16:37:22] <robertmaxrees> having the hand there hints to the user that it is currently interactive.
[16:39:01] <randymarsh9> ah gotcha
[16:39:18] <randymarsh9> this is the effect i'm after though: https://jsfiddle.net/gxoofjxe/13/
[16:39:39] <robertmaxrees> why do you want the finger there if it's interactive after the user clicks?
[16:40:15] <robertmaxrees> *if it isn't
[16:40:42] <randymarsh9> because i want the finger to be visible over that item all the time, so they know that that item is clickable
[16:40:53] <randymarsh9> but if they click really fast it just ignores the extra clicks
[16:40:56] <robertmaxrees> except it's not clickable while it's animating.
[16:41:01] <randymarsh9> that's true
[16:41:12] <randymarsh9> i dunno i just prefer it
[16:41:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:42:01] <randymarsh9> trust me it's better lol
[16:42:07] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[16:42:38] <randymarsh9> if it became unclickable for like 10 seconds i could understand why changing the cursor to something else might make sense
[16:42:47] <randymarsh9> but it's just for 200ms
[16:42:48] <MassDebates> randymarsh9 <- Name checks out.
[16:43:07] <robertmaxrees> then set a boolean var to hold that state.
[16:43:09] <MassDebates> randymarsh9:  Experienced web users can react and process ui changes as little as 50ms
[16:43:15] <randymarsh9> MassDebates: i'm sorry i thought this was america
[16:43:29] <MassDebates> Uh
[16:43:29] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gxoofjxe/14/
[16:43:33] <robertmaxrees> but i'd really avoid doing that.
[16:43:47] <randymarsh9> it's a south park quote lol
[16:43:48] <robertmaxrees> it's a Bad Idea™
[16:44:10] <randymarsh9> MassDebates: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDoGqZUHVEI
[16:45:32] <MassDebates> I know it's a south park quote
[16:45:42] <MassDebates> i just had trouble retorting with an equally-well-placed quote
[16:45:55] <MassDebates> Give me a break I've literally just gotten back from a shitposting vacation
[16:46:17] <MassDebates> In all seriousness, though, you really should use ui feedback cues to your advantage, not work against them
[16:46:24] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^^
[16:46:26] <robertmaxrees> like.
[16:46:34] <robertmaxrees> breaking conventions is a really bad idea.
[16:46:53] <robertmaxrees> and 9/10 when you think your use case is ~*special*~, it isn't.
[16:46:58] <MassDebates> Well
[16:47:02] <MassDebates> My cases are special and I'm always right
[16:47:08] <MassDebates> but you're probably wrong on this one, randymarsh9
[16:47:10] <robertmaxrees> usually a sign of other ui/ux problems imo.
[16:47:20] <MassDebates> And soon it becomes a woman eats the fly thing
[16:47:23] <MassDebates> or is it a spider
[16:47:42] <MassDebates> Whatever, the point is that often times people break best practices to sort-of cover up or compensate for something else that's being done incorrectly
[16:49:02] <robertmaxrees> my entire point >.>
[16:51:38] <MassDebates> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Pretty sure it's mine now
[16:52:31] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:53:38] <randymarsh9> hm best practices or freedom
[16:53:44] <robertmaxrees> both
[16:53:47] <randymarsh9> lol
[16:53:49] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:54:06] <randymarsh9> i dunno this seems worse to me
[16:54:08] <randymarsh9> https://jsfiddle.net/gxoofjxe/15/
[16:54:21] <robertmaxrees> but why?
[16:54:32] <robertmaxrees> can you reason about why?
[16:54:34] <randymarsh9> because now i got a flicking cursor
[16:54:46] <randymarsh9> not a fan
[16:54:47] <robertmaxrees> because the cursor itself isn't interaction.
[16:54:54] <randymarsh9> yea i get that
[16:55:03] <robertmaxrees> "i don't like something" != a good reason :)
[16:55:23] <robertmaxrees> if the user clicks during that animation, are you going to be responding in a particular way?
[16:55:27] <robertmaxrees> or just ignoring the click?
[16:55:41] <randymarsh9> i mean i get why it's like that but it's more distracting that 'conveying useful info' here
[16:55:46] <randymarsh9> than*
[16:56:01] <randymarsh9> no
[16:56:04] <robertmaxrees> you sure it's distracting?
[16:56:17] <robertmaxrees> maybe there's a reason it's so obvious.
[16:56:58] <randymarsh9> compared to this?
[16:57:01] <randymarsh9> https://jsfiddle.net/gxoofjxe/16/
[16:57:40] <robertmaxrees> when i see the filder, I assume I can interact with something.  if the finger goes away, that hints that it's currently not interactive.
[16:57:41] <randymarsh9> just seems unnecessary
[16:57:49] <robertmaxrees> *finger
[16:57:59] <randymarsh9> you're also a web developer
[16:58:18] <randymarsh9> 99% of people visiting this site are going to ask themselves whta's up with the flickering cursor lol
[16:58:19] <robertmaxrees> who works for a site that has a LOT of traffic.
[16:58:27] <robertmaxrees> but what would I know about any of this, right?
[16:58:29] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:59:22] <randymarsh9> i know best practices win
[16:59:33] <randymarsh9> *quietly pushes https://jsfiddle.net/gxoofjxe/16/ to live site*
[16:59:42] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[16:59:46] <robertmaxrees> your choice to ignore advice.
[16:59:50] <randymarsh9> jk
[16:59:58] <randymarsh9> lol
[17:00:08] <taplar_> no, that's the truth.  everything in here is just advise
[17:00:25] <robertmaxrees> so.
[17:00:35] <robertmaxrees> lemme ask this: what happens when the user clicks that button?
[17:00:43] <robertmaxrees> what does the animation signify?
[17:00:51] <randymarsh9> that they clicked on it
[17:01:01] <robertmaxrees> but wha3t does the button do?
[17:01:03] <robertmaxrees> *what
[17:01:09] <randymarsh9> toggles the text
[17:01:21] <robertmaxrees> i give up
[17:01:25] <randymarsh9> lol
[17:01:37] <robertmaxrees> dunno why it's so funny but alright.
[17:02:23] <randymarsh9> cause you all think i'm crazy for wanting to keep the cursor static
[17:02:39] <robertmaxrees> i don't think you're crazy.
[17:03:13] <robertmaxrees> just find it odd when you have a bunch of people saying "hey that sounds odd, here's some free advice" to respond with "yeah but it looks weird to me"
[17:03:14] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[17:03:36] <robertmaxrees> either way.  my keyboard at home broke and i've been using an old membrane one and cripes is it messing up my wrists.
[17:04:10] <randymarsh9> fair enough
[17:44:41] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: so earlier you asked if there's a reason i'm not calling $('#box') once and storing the result
[17:44:47] <randymarsh9> is this what you meant?
[17:44:49] <randymarsh9> https://jsfiddle.net/gxoofjxe/17/
[17:45:58] <taplar_> that's one way
[17:46:30] <randymarsh9> is there overhead by calling it by the selector every time? or is it more for readability?
[17:46:58] <taplar_> every time you do $() it creates a new jQuery object and has overhead
[17:47:19] <randymarsh9> a new one?
[17:47:26] <taplar_> yes
[17:48:31] <randymarsh9> so in the example i posted here: https://jsfiddle.net/gxoofjxe/9/
[17:48:40] <randymarsh9> it's creating 4 different jquery objects?
[17:48:45] <taplar_> yes
[17:48:51] <randymarsh9> crap
[17:48:57] <randymarsh9> what a mess lol
[17:48:59] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:49:23] <robertmaxrees> it's not the end of the world, but a good thing to know.
[17:49:26] <randymarsh9> it's funny cause the other day i noticed my tab started crashing
[17:49:33] <randymarsh9> guess now i know why lol
[17:50:05] <robertmaxrees> that wouldn't necessarily cauise it to crash.
[17:50:06] <taplar_> it's just something that can lead to performance issues if you have a lot of them, plus if you throw in really involved lookups
[17:50:22] <taplar_> and it's kinda non-DRY
[17:50:30] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:51:34] <randymarsh9> what's non-DRY mean
[17:51:41] <randymarsh9> non standard?
[17:52:05] <taplar_> Don't Repeat Yourself
[17:52:08] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[17:52:16] <randymarsh9> ah gotcha
[17:52:19] <robertmaxrees> don't repeat work you don't need to do :)
[17:52:21] <randymarsh9> yes very non-DRY lol
[17:52:34] <randymarsh9> i didn't know i could do it the other way but makes sense
[17:52:46] <robertmaxrees> well.
[17:52:49] <robertmaxrees> think about it :)
[17:52:51] <robertmaxrees> what is $() ?
[17:52:56] <robertmaxrees> in the most basic terms.
[17:53:10] <randymarsh9> jQuery call?
[17:53:14] <robertmaxrees> which is a...
[17:53:30] <randymarsh9> function?
[17:53:33] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:53:33] <randymarsh9> lol
[17:53:35] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:53:36] <randymarsh9> oh cool
[17:53:49] <robertmaxrees> $() is just a function.  it returns a jquery object.  but it's still just a function.
[17:55:12] <randymarsh9> yeah one thing i'm still trying to wrap my head around is how you can store functions inside variables
[17:55:30] <randymarsh9> i just learned you can do that recently but it's still confusing to me
[17:55:33] <robertmaxrees> well.
[17:55:37] <robertmaxrees> so check this out.
[17:55:42] <robertmaxrees> in JS, everything is an object.
[17:55:52] <robertmaxrees> strings, arrays, numbers, etc.
[17:56:26] <grapheti> tuplar used me as an object
[17:56:31] <grapheti> taplar*
[17:56:35] <robertmaxrees> functions are objects, too.
[17:56:44] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4xa58jnq/
[17:56:48] <randymarsh9> that explains why i gott a lot of '[Object[object]' in my alerts when i first started out lol
[17:56:52] <robertmaxrees> there are three ways to declare functions.,
[17:57:32] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4xa58jnq/3/
[17:58:46] <robertmaxrees> https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/07/06/function-declarations-vs-function-expressions/ covers the details.
[17:59:31] <randymarsh9> robertmaxrees: i only knew about the third way
[17:59:47] <randymarsh9> functionThree() is how i always do it
[18:00:03] <robertmaxrees> there are some subtle differences between the three.
[18:00:10] <randymarsh9> first two don't really make sense to me
[18:00:19] <randymarsh9> except that they are going into a variable
[18:00:46] <robertmaxrees> function declarations go into an object, too.
[18:01:01] <randymarsh9> yea that part makes sense now
[18:01:05] <randymarsh9> since everything is object
[18:01:10] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:01:42] <randymarsh9> one and two look almost the same to me
[18:01:53] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[18:01:59] <robertmaxrees> and two and three look as similar ;)
[18:02:09] <randymarsh9> mm yea
[18:02:26] <randymarsh9> so function two is like an intermediary? lol
[18:02:26] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:02:30] <robertmaxrees> nah
[18:02:36] <robertmaxrees> that article I linked explains the distinctions.
[18:02:40] <randymarsh9> cool
[18:02:43] <randymarsh9> i will read that!!
[18:02:47] <randymarsh9> ty
[18:03:54] <robertmaxrees> what'll really bake your noodle is the fact that arrays and objects are more similar than you'd think.
[18:04:37] <randymarsh9> yea i'll follow up with you on that in like maybe 3 months
[18:04:41] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:05:09] <robertmaxrees> arrays are basically objects with some special methods, a special length property, and handles numbners for keynames.
[18:05:35] <grapheti> dam special objects
[18:06:24] <taplar_> my girl asked why i objectify women.  i told her i'm a java developer.  i objectify everything
[18:07:07] <grapheti> LOL
[18:09:56] <grapheti> then you'll get to closures
[18:10:35] <grapheti> n' prototypes
[18:11:54] <taplar_> i never close transactions.  i'm not big on committing
[18:12:11] <grapheti> and the ol' 'this' within objects
[18:12:23] <grapheti> just use let lol
[18:12:42] <grapheti> haha
[18:12:42] <taplar_> function(b) { let it = b; }
[18:12:49] <grapheti> :D
[18:12:54] <robertmaxrees> and const
[18:13:06] <grapheti> yeah, you'll use const more prolly
[18:17:55] <robertmaxrees> should be, at least.
[18:18:01] <grapheti> then you'll go insane and try to recreate jquery - https://jsfiddle.net/graphettion/x5kr41jv/
[18:18:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:18:34] <grapheti> lol
[18:18:36] <robertmaxrees> you just loooooove linking that.
[18:18:46] <grapheti> then you'll be ded
[18:18:52] <grapheti> that's how I learned the scripts
[18:19:31] <grapheti> https://codepen.io/collection/Ayagxj/
[18:25:31] <grapheti> And my little UI thing - https://codepen.io/Graphettion/pen/brpwVP
[18:25:35] <grapheti> But there's so many of those
[18:25:57] <grapheti> prolly just use https://vuetifyjs.com/
[18:27:39] <taplar_> you haven't lived until you've broken json stringify with a recursive json structure
[18:28:00] <grapheti> haha dam
[18:28:17] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[18:28:22] <robertmaxrees> we've dealt with that one.
[18:28:22] <grapheti> that's some O(n) shit right thur
[18:29:41] <taplar_> fixed now, but i was wondering why my element wasn't being preserved
[18:32:25] <taplar_> heh, that vuetify kinda makes me chuckle
[18:32:48] <grapheti> :P
[18:33:27] <taplar_> like, i understand the usefulness of reusable stuff rather than remaking the wheel
[18:33:46] <taplar_> but some times i wonder when it comes at the expense of people not understanding what they are doing
[18:34:18] <robertmaxrees> really depends on the case imo.
[18:35:48] <taplar_> true, though one of the selling points of vue was it was less bloat.  pretty small library.  but then you throw in a framework like that.  hello bloat
[18:36:25] <taplar_> then again it can be precompiled so maybe not
[18:36:26] <grapheti> mhm
[18:36:54] <robertmaxrees> it'
[18:36:55] <grapheti> ded code galore
[18:36:59] <robertmaxrees> *it's also the tradeoffs.
[18:37:13] <robertmaxrees> where are you incurring that bloat?
[18:37:26] <grapheti> I'll create the most bloated app if I was in this situation - http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view3/4746482/swordfish-hacker-o.gif
[18:37:26] <robertmaxrees> does that bloat actually meaningfully impact page performance?
[18:37:50] <robertmaxrees> it's like when people spend a bunch of time optimizing scripts and then use a custom font on their site.
[18:37:58] <taplar_> lol
[18:38:12] <grapheti> https://davidwalsh.name/font-loading
[18:38:21] <grapheti> neat lil trick
[18:38:46] <taplar_> ya i knew about #4
[18:38:53] <grapheti> But, good point, use time wisely where it counts.
[18:39:04] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:39:14] <robertmaxrees> the best solution for custom fonts is to not use them.
[18:39:16] <grapheti> I used #2
[18:39:20] <robertmaxrees> basically per the googs.
[18:39:30] <grapheti> I can't agree more with that.
[18:39:46] <grapheti> unless you just want your grandma on your page
[18:39:55] <grapheti> or whoever will wait that long
[18:39:56] <robertmaxrees> even then.
[18:44:02] <grapheti> I'm just happy I get to use CSS grids
[18:47:11] <grapheti> https://github.com/FremyCompany/css-grid-polyfill
[18:49:21] <grapheti> https://codepen.io/iamminn/pen/rGwqxe
[18:49:25] <grapheti> that's pretty damn cool
[18:50:06] <grapheti> aiight, I'm out
[18:50:11] <grapheti> lata homies
[18:50:33] <taplar_> think i'm about to do the same.  i need to crash early.  stayed up to late yesterday
[18:50:43] <grapheti> it happens
[18:50:49] <grapheti> cya
[18:50:53] <taplar_> l8r
[20:16:46] <randymarsh9> hey guys
[20:16:55] <randymarsh9> can someone tell me why this alert fires as soon as the page loads?
[20:16:59] <randymarsh9> https://jsfiddle.net/gxoofjxe/18/
[20:17:14] <robertmaxrees> because that's now how that works :)
[20:17:20] <randymarsh9> now?
[20:17:24] <robertmaxrees> *not
[20:17:27] <randymarsh9> oh
[20:17:36] <randymarsh9> i thought it works only when you 'click'
[20:17:43] <randymarsh9> but apparently that's not right lol
[20:17:53] <robertmaxrees> so - think of it this way - what happens if you do var foo = alert('hi');?
[20:18:28] <robertmaxrees> what is foo equal to in that case?>
[20:18:29] <randymarsh9> i'm not sure
[20:18:32] <randymarsh9> oh
[20:18:35] <randymarsh9> the alert
[20:18:38] <robertmaxrees> no.
[20:18:41] <robertmaxrees> the return of the alert.
[20:18:45] <robertmaxrees> alert() is a functionm.
[20:18:45] <randymarsh9> crap
[20:18:47] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:18:51] <randymarsh9> riiight
[20:18:55] <randymarsh9> the return
[20:19:02] <robertmaxrees> you're passing the return of that function call as an argument.
[20:19:05] <randymarsh9> ok i was completetly missing that
[20:19:07] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:19:17] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to get clickHandler to work?
[20:19:33] <randymarsh9> i thought i was assignging *the function* to the variable
[20:19:37] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[20:19:38] <randymarsh9> but it's just the return right?
[20:19:42] <robertmaxrees> because you're calling it./
[20:19:50] <randymarsh9> yes.
[20:19:51] <robertmaxrees> if you remove the (), then you're passing the function.
[20:20:19] <randymarsh9> oh
[20:20:30] <randymarsh9> if it didn't have the parenthesis, then it would be setting it equal to the function
[20:20:39] <robertmaxrees> *the return of the function.
[20:20:45] <robertmaxrees> err, yeah, sorry.
[20:20:47] <robertmaxrees> misread that.
[20:20:51] <randymarsh9> ok right
[20:20:55] <randymarsh9> man
[20:20:58] <randymarsh9> so many small details
[20:21:01] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[20:21:08] <robertmaxrees> just js 101 :)_
[20:21:11] <randymarsh9> lol
[20:21:17] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gxoofjxe/19/
[20:21:24] <robertmaxrees> if you wanted to pass clickHandler, you'd do this.
[20:23:13] <randymarsh9> i was trying to understand why the alert fires automatically on the fiddle i did, and how come you have to click on the #box on yours
[20:23:37] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[20:24:17] <randymarsh9> i would have guessed i need to click on the #box for that alert to fire
[20:24:21] <randymarsh9> but it happens on page load
[20:24:25] <robertmaxrees> right.
[20:24:38] <robertmaxrees> because it has to evaluate the function to get the return to pass as the arge.
[20:24:40] <robertmaxrees> *arg
[20:25:11] <randymarsh9> oh and during eval it shows the message
[20:25:29] <randymarsh9> and after that the return of alert() gets triggered on click but there is nothing in the return!
[20:25:32] <randymarsh9> right?
[20:25:38] <robertmaxrees> right.
[20:25:41] <randymarsh9> yes
[20:25:45] <randymarsh9> time for js102
[20:25:47] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[20:25:54] <randymarsh9> cool ty
[20:25:57] <robertmaxrees> def.
