[02:29:18] <arup_r> I am trying enable the button when all field has values, otherwise I want the button to be disabled. It is working, but not with checkbox. How can I handle the checkbox. Right now evenif the checkbox is not checked button is enabled. Any help on this? Here is my code: https://jsfiddle.net/bhtckbb8/
[02:29:49] <Cork> arup_r: prop('checked')
[02:30:11] <arup_r> Cork: where to add it?
[02:30:24] <arup_r> in this test if ($(this).val() === '') { ?
[02:31:00] <arup_r> if ($(this).val() === '' || $(this).prop('checked')) { <~~ like this ?
[02:32:52] <Cork> arup_r: https://jsfiddle.net/bhtckbb8/1/
[02:33:09] <Cork> created a new simpler check functiobn
[02:33:13] * Cork gtg
[02:34:21] <arup_r> ok checking it
[02:35:16] <arup_r> Cork: same issue :)
[04:10:41] <neo_> hi guys
[04:10:58] <neo_> who know why owl carousel shifted ? http://rostvinil.ru/salon/shumoizolyaciya/
[04:11:21] <neo_> in mobile it look like this http://prntscr.com/gcteeu
[04:11:35] <neo_> if refresh viewport
[04:11:42] <neo_> without update all good work
[04:11:56] <neo_> http://prntscr.com/gcteof
[06:19:51] <EugenA> i'm in click event function, how can I access html tag by classname in current context?
[06:20:42] <localh0st> EugenA: .find()
[06:22:12] <EugenA> thanks
[07:57:11] <MikeD_> identify mynick
[09:26:07] <poboy> do jsfiddles "expire" after a certain amount of time?
[09:29:10] <MikeD_> i think you can safely assume they'll live a long time... but there is no guarantee
[09:30:22] <poboy> so a week or two should be good then.  thanks
[09:33:31] <Cork> poboy: i haven't seen any fiddles expire at all as of yet
[09:33:43] <Cork> so that is at least like 5 years
[09:37:02] <poboy> nice
[09:38:54] <ksm101> btw.. why do you guys use fiddles mostly and not codepens, because it's older (so that's a habit) ? or more readable ?
[09:39:08] <Cork> ksm101: reliable
[09:39:26] <Cork> codepend and jsbin works fine if only one user edits them
[09:39:51] <Cork> but they lose changes right left and center when two ppl start working on the same code snippet
[09:40:10] <ksm101> ok, I get it. Thanks Cork.
[09:40:10] <Cork> so the point where i never modify content in a link to codepen
[09:40:19] <Cork> to the point*
[09:52:52] <cannap> @Cork and this is why jsffiddle has not support for ctrl + s? to save
[09:52:53] <cannap> sucks
[09:53:04] <cannap> i press it anyway and then browser want to save the site xD
[09:53:14] <Cork> cannap: it supports ctrl+s
[09:53:20] <cannap> where
[09:53:21] <Cork> not all browser does though
[09:53:24] <cannap> i use chrome
[09:54:05] <cannap> https://gyazo.com/e30eeeced76894c984cc7d2e015e4355
[09:55:11] <Cork> cannap: exactly as press ctrl + s the page starts saving
[09:55:25] <Cork> and the default action pops up in the browser
[09:55:34] <Cork> just close the save dialog and wait for the page to save
[09:55:49] <Cork> that was the browser support i talked about
[09:55:49] <cannap> https://stackblitz.com/edit/es6-audoyk
[09:55:53] <cannap> here they prevent
[09:56:02] <ksm101> Doesn't work either on latest mac chrome
[09:56:13] <cannap> they just dont support ctrl +s
[09:56:17] <Cork> there might be some browser specific ways to prevent the default actions
[09:56:23] <Cork> but there isn't a web standard way to do it
[09:56:28] <Cork> and many browsers doesn't provide it at all
[09:56:38] <cannap> it work in all other online
[09:56:43] <cannap> but not on jsfiddle..
[09:56:52] <cannap> in all other editors*
[09:57:30] <Cork> not sure how then cause last i checked (about 6 monethds) webpages can't "win" over built in key combos
[09:57:37] <Cork> *months
[09:59:33] <cannap> i think they wont add this in jsfiddle
[09:59:41] <cannap> because every save makes an update and version control
[09:59:50] <cannap> this is why on other editor like codepen url never change
[09:59:54] <cannap> and you work in the same thing
[12:12:48] <JonTheWong> hey everyone; i'm looking for an existing project that would allow me to display local website demos like https://material.io/resizer/ ideally i want to setup a domain.tld/demo/site1 .. /site2  This way people can preview a working version of the site in multiple viewports.
[12:47:38] <hellyeah> hey
[12:47:50] <hellyeah> why it  prints out ,,
[12:47:53] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/rvgatgns/54/
[12:48:24] <taplar> ?
[12:48:42] <hellyeah> did you see alert?
[12:49:00] <taplar> what line does that alert?
[12:49:07] <taplar> and we've asked before to not use alerts for debugging
[12:49:46] <hellyeah> i wont next time
[12:49:51] <hellyeah> line 61
[12:50:40] <taplar> you're not always returning a value from your map
[12:51:01] <taplar> you have two conditionals that would cause it to not return in some cases
[12:51:20] <hellyeah> hmm
[12:51:38] <hellyeah> my condition is wrong
[12:51:40] <hellyeah> ?
[12:52:02] <taplar> idk, but that is the nature of map
[12:52:17] <hellyeah> damn
[12:52:19] <taplar> it's expecting a return.  if you don't return anything, it will have an empty object in some of the indexes
[12:52:44] <taplar> empty/null/undefined
[12:52:59] <hellyeah> it returns correct
[12:53:24] <hellyeah> i changed the age  50 to 52  line 9
[12:53:30] <hellyeah> and return 52 hmm https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/rvgatgns/55/
[12:53:44] <hellyeah> what shoul i do
[12:53:47] <hellyeah> split again
[12:54:44] <taplar> either filter first and then map, or after the map, find all the ones that are set
[12:55:57] <hellyeah> hmm
[12:56:02] <hellyeah> filter return object
[12:58:35] <hellyeah> good
[12:58:39] <hellyeah> filter returns
[12:59:32] <hellyeah> bdamn
[13:01:14] <hellyeah> ah
[13:01:15] <hellyeah> got it
[13:01:20] <hellyeah> what you said taplar
[13:01:29] <hellyeah> yeah this is 52, undefined, undefined
[13:01:37] <hellyeah> if i do filter(map
[13:01:46] <hellyeah> i can remove those undefine things
[13:03:44] <hellyeah> wut
[13:03:51] <hellyeah> come on
[13:03:54] <hellyeah> come on
[13:06:00] <hellyeah> taplar:  am in correct way https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/rvgatgns/56/
[13:06:39] <taplar> you tell me
[13:06:53] <hellyeah> true, false, false
[13:07:35] <hellyeah> well i missed something
[13:07:38] <taplar> i mean, you are doing map twice
[13:07:46] <taplar> not a filter any where in site
[13:07:56] <hellyeah> damn
[13:08:01] <hellyeah> sorry
[13:08:22] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah are you trying to pull another late night?
[13:08:47] <hellyeah> i saw something wrong
[13:08:53] <hellyeah> thats different
[13:11:44] <taplar> array.map( get what you want ).filter( return just the !undefined ones )
[13:12:38] <taplar> or   array.filter( return the ones you want ).map( get only what you want )
[13:13:22] <taplar> or results = [];  array.each( add to results if it is what you want, only what you want )
[13:13:28] <taplar> *forEach
[13:14:19] <taplar> though i'm loosing my edge since i just realized this is a vanilla problem
[13:20:44] <hellyeah> that must be a joke
[13:21:09] <hellyeah> DANG
[13:25:22] <hellyeah> okey
[13:25:26] <hellyeah> i hmm
[13:25:34] <hellyeah> i dont know why i am writing here
[13:30:58] <hellyeah> i did something wrong
[13:31:33] <hellyeah> it seems something is getting better https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/awc97yjb/
[13:32:10] <hellyeah> right
[13:32:24] <taplar> how do you get filter(map()) from filter().map() ?
[13:32:44] <taplar> it's not a nested operation
[13:32:47] <taplar> it's a chained operation
[13:32:58] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:33:04] <taplar> you take your array, and you either map it or filter it to get one set of new results
[13:33:12] <taplar> then you take that result and do the second operatoin
[13:34:00] <hellyeah> i didnt know it is chained
[13:34:23] <taplar> array.map( get what you want ).filter( return just the !undefined ones )  <-- what part of that didn't say chained to you?
[13:35:16] <taplar> or if something isn't clear to you, ask dude
[13:36:26] <hellyeah> okay
[13:36:29] <hellyeah> i did it
[13:36:36] <hellyeah> i did that
[13:37:33] <hellyeah> it prints same thing three times https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/awc97yjb/1/
[13:38:43] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/awc97yjb/2/
[13:39:29] <hellyeah> i know the problem man
[13:39:47] <taplar> ?
[13:40:07] <hellyeah> sorry
[13:40:16] <hellyeah> problem is in map
[13:40:27] <taplar> yep
[13:40:59] <taplar> how does javascript scope work?
[13:42:16] <hellyeah> i fixed that
[13:42:48] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/awc97yjb/3/
[13:42:57] <hellyeah> do you mean block scope?
[13:43:42] <taplar> you had a variable without it having a var any where, which made it global.  which was why you were getting what you were getting before.
[13:43:48] <taplar> but you fixed that
[13:47:03] <hellyeah> taplar:  actually if i return input outside of if
[13:47:09] <hellyeah> it returns three object
[13:47:21] <taplar> yep
[13:47:21] <hellyeah> i returned input inside if and it return one object
[13:47:29] <hellyeah> i dont understand this clearly
[13:47:35] <hellyeah> ah
[13:47:43] <hellyeah> i understand actually
[13:47:48] <hellyeah> obj has three index
[13:47:53] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:47:56] <hellyeah> ah
[13:48:04] <hellyeah> okay i got it i guess
[13:48:11] <hellyeah> never initialize the object
[13:48:23] <hellyeah> so it just adds object one by one three times
[13:48:29] <hellyeah> same object in scope and never dies
[13:48:33] <hellyeah> right?
[13:48:39] <taplar> pretty much
[13:48:44] <hellyeah> okey
[13:48:55] <hellyeah> there is two classic answers in it world
[13:49:03] <hellyeah> it depends and pretty much
[13:49:04] <hellyeah> :D
[13:49:19] <hellyeah> i understand what you mean by scope right now
[13:52:44] <hellyeah> okay
[13:57:18] <hellyeah> ywhy did you say "pretty much" taplar ?
[13:59:02] <taplar> you said something about never initialize and things dieing
[13:59:13] <taplar> not entirely clear what you were referring to
[14:05:32] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:05:45] <hellyeah> dieing, not destroying
[14:05:59] <hellyeah> initialize again you know just recreate
[14:06:33] <taplar> i'm not clear on what variable you're talking about
[14:06:40] <taplar> but in any case, you got it working
[14:07:43] <hellyeah> nevermind
[14:23:09] <hellyeah> good
[14:57:37] <blndidiot> hey all, I'm not terribly familiar with jquery but trying to fix a broken wordpress plugin.  there is a blob of jquery that runs a js script that renders to a canvas and inserts html on the page. on mobile, when the device is rotated, it does not signal that jquery to re-run, so the javascript doesn't regenerate the canvas.  any thoughts how to fix this?
[15:02:15] <blndidiot> I essentially just need to rerun this bit of jquery when the orientationchange event listener fires.  https://pastebin.com/yBGG0Kj9
[15:02:32] <blndidiot> But I don't know how, or if it's possible to do that.
[15:50:49] <SideFX> Can anyone think of a reason why $( document ).ready(function() would work on a page but a $('#idthink').click(function () {
[15:50:52] <SideFX> wouldn't work
[15:51:35] <SideFX> If I copy the functions into a jsfiddle they all work, so there is something on this script not letting me either access the id or something
[15:53:23] <pavonia> Check if the element actually exists right before you register the handler
[15:56:31] <SideFX> The object is there, if I inspect object It shows me everything
[16:06:07] <pavonia> SideFX: Could you show some code?
[16:32:04] <SideFX> This site is loading like 50 different scrips and I'm assuming something is blocking the code I have from working but I don't even know where to begin to find what is causing the problem
[17:19:14] * taplar is curious how logging if the selector is found equates to 'i inspected the object'
[22:27:47] <audiofile> Hi, I'm using a star rating plugin http://plugins.krajee.com/star-rating#events
[22:27:50] <audiofile> Or rather, trying to
[22:28:10] <audiofile> I've created an event handler for 'rating.change' as mentioned in the link
[22:28:31] <audiofile> But the event doesn't fire at all
[22:28:44] <audiofile> Hang on, I'll paste the element and the event handler
[22:31:04] <audiofile> http://jsbin.com/necuyekeco/edit?html,output
[22:31:30] <audiofile> Oh, and I've added all the prerequisites viz jquery, bootstrap and the minified js and css files that the library provides
[22:31:33] <audiofile> So no issues there :)
[22:31:40] <audiofile> But only thing that doesn't work is the event
