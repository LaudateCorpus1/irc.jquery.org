[04:28:53] <linuxson> Hey guys...anyone here have some experience with Charts.js?
[05:59:40] <hellyeah> do you think svg with jquery is good idea or bad idea?
[07:05:13] <Cork> hellyeah: svg isn't html so you get some cross document caveats you need to be careful of
[07:05:24] <Cork> hellyeah: with or without jquery matters less
[07:12:50] <hellyeah> i see
[07:13:19] <hellyeah> i read add or remove class could be problematic
[07:13:36] <hellyeah> i just need click event, animation, add remove class and ajax
[07:14:48] <hellyeah> any problem you see here Cork?
[07:17:14] <Cork> hellyeah: all of them are
[07:17:27] <hellyeah> all of them
[07:17:27] <Cork> as like i said, svg isn't html, so you get cross document problems
[07:17:29] <hellyeah> damn ?
[07:17:47] <hellyeah> what about using plainjs?
[07:17:52] <Cork> meaning $('#selector') won't find it cause it isn't in the current document
[07:18:03] <Cork> it doesn't matter what js you run
[07:18:19] <Cork> it isn't that you can't do it, it is that normal code doesn't work
[07:18:25] <hellyeah> seems that work https://jsfiddle.net/2fz9366x/6/
[07:18:44] <hellyeah> Cork what about this?
[07:18:49] <Cork> ex $('#elm') has to be $('svg').contents().find('#elm').on('click') and so on
[07:19:00] <hellyeah> ah
[07:19:15] <hellyeah> i guess i understand
[07:19:48] <Cork> hellyeah: also make sure to test in the different browsers, cause i'm not sure it works the same cross browsers
[07:20:00] <hellyeah> so svg is html tag but it is not really html
[07:20:00] <Cork> i've just learned to be very careful with dynamic svg
[07:20:10] <Cork> no svg is svg that is xml
[07:20:18] <Cork> it doesn't even share parent standard
[07:21:22] <hellyeah> well any framework or something to work with svg?
[07:22:19] <hellyeah> why is it so different_?
[08:07:27] <Pythonero> Hi all
[08:07:54] <Pythonero> any one can help me with a little problem with click events?
[08:08:42] <Pythonero> I have a little script where anyone can click over a html element and makes an action, but latter must click again over the same element but it seems doesn't work, is any way to make it?
[08:09:04] <Pythonero> I was searching during days, please i need help
[08:14:58] <AdamPDotty> "click over"
[08:15:34] <AdamPDotty> "doesn't work"
[08:38:17] <Cork> i guess he means click on
[08:47:53] <dan_j> Hi. I've got a few div's defined like this: <div class="button_rounded_orange_cancel centrediv register_cancel">Cancel</div>
[08:48:07] <dan_j> But when I do this, it doesnt trigger: $('.register_cancel').click(function(){
[08:48:21] <dan_j> Any idea why click doesnt run?
[08:50:48] <dan_j> Never mind. It hadnt uploaded for some reason.
[08:50:50] <dan_j> Working now
[08:50:54] <AdamPDotty> usual mistake would be to call it before the button existed
[08:51:03] <AdamPDotty> or that
[08:51:13] <AdamPDotty> still awful class names
[08:58:25] <prillian5> what does a ajax-success need as return value to be fired?
[09:09:06] <projectui> good mornin's peeples :)
[09:46:50] <Guest75488> hi, how can I update live a jquery slider over different browser tabs?
[09:47:37] <Guest75488> ui slider
[09:47:42] <nix_bpi> that's an interesting question. I would love to know the answer
[09:48:52] <Guest75488> socket.io? crossbar?
[09:49:22] <prillian5> Guest75488: You can't access to the different containers via DOM ?
[09:49:59] <hellyeah> why is there a delay in ajax call https://jsfiddle.net/2fz9366x/17/ ?
[09:50:48] <systemfault> Because your connection sucks.
[09:50:56] <systemfault> What kind of question is that? :/
[09:54:30] <hellyeah> systemfault:  actually it waits like 5-10 secs then i saw the alert
[09:54:42] <hellyeah> it may be because of my connection i dont know
[10:01:16] <FilipNortic> hellyeah: why are you using alerts insted of console.log() still there are alot of upsides to doing the completion check there instead the main one in this case being that it forces you to open the console where you can see all the timings
[10:21:05] <snfgf> HELLO
[10:22:41] <snfgf> window.my_var = $('#myDiv'); typeof my_var == 'string' // true
[10:22:43] <snfgf> wth
[10:22:49] <snfgf> i thought it would be an object
[10:24:02] <taplar> ===
[10:30:39] <snfgf> taplar, ...
[10:30:55] <snfgf> typeof window.my_var // string
[10:31:35] <taplar> you're saying if you console log it it says string?
[10:32:00] <snfgf> yes
[10:33:22] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/at4c26tt/  dunno what your doing then
[10:42:23] <dan_j> I want to do something if nothing has been clicked for more than 5 minutes. Is there any way to add a click event to everything on the page like this $('SELECT_EVERYTHING').click(function(){RESET_TIMEOUT_TO_ZERO});
[10:42:59] <taplar> you could put it on the body.  click events bubble
[10:43:17] <sillyme> $(document).click or $(window).click... was my first idea
[10:44:50] <dan_j> Ok. Thanks. I'll give it a go
[10:46:21] <dan_j> Partially works. I think where I return false, it then doesnt pass the click to the document
[10:51:58] <linuxson> Need some help with my Charts.js line chart. When I set the x axis labelOffset property, it moves the labels on the x axis, not the y as stated in the Charts.js documentation
[12:27:50] <design77stud> hi
[12:27:57] <robertmaxrees> good morning
[12:38:04] <ExeciN> I have a click event bound on #topics:not(.disabled) but the event is triggered even when the elements have a disabled class. what am I doing wrong? https://codepen.io/anon/pen/JbavzQ?editors=1010#0
[12:38:50] <robertmaxrees> the selector doesn't update as time goes on.
[12:39:08] <robertmaxrees> $("#subjects:not(.active)") matches when it binds, so it attaches.
[12:39:20] <robertmaxrees> bind to a parent and add that part to the second arg.
[12:40:52] <ExeciN> like this? $("#topics").on("click", "button:not(.disabled)", function() {}
[12:40:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:41:12] <robertmaxrees> this looks really confusing
[12:41:24] <robertmaxrees> does #subjects ever get the .active class?
[12:41:34] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't look like it.
[12:41:39] <ExeciN> no, only the buttons
[12:41:50] <robertmaxrees> then #subjects:not(.active) is useless.
[12:42:02] <robertmaxrees> because it'll never get that class.
[12:42:08] <ExeciN> ah I see
[12:44:11] <ExeciN> thanks
[12:47:19] <robertmaxrees> deffo
[12:48:04] <taplar> someone on SO tried to argue with me that there wasn't anything wrong with $()
[12:48:06] <taplar> crap
[12:48:10] <robertmaxrees> wut?
[12:48:15] <taplar> $('[class=blah]');
[12:48:26] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[12:48:32] <nix_bpi> taplar: ok... why is $() a bad idea? I'm actually using it now
[12:48:37] <taplar> lol
[12:48:41] <taplar> i hit enter by accident
[12:49:10] <nix_bpi> oh. so it's ok to use it for creating a blank jquery object set?
[12:49:19] <taplar> terrible!
[12:49:23] * taplar flips a table
[12:49:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:49:39] <nix_bpi> ok. so how would you do it?
[12:49:46] <robertmaxrees> he didn't mean $() itself.
[12:50:00] <robertmaxrees> he was talking about using attribute selector syntax for classes.
[12:50:12] <nix_bpi> oh ok
[12:50:20] <nix_bpi> so i'm good?
[12:50:29] * nix_bpi cowers in a corner waiting for praise.
[12:50:30] <taplar> you didn't see the table?
[12:50:37] <robertmaxrees> O.o i'm lost haha
[12:50:41] <taplar> *shrug*
[12:50:52] <nix_bpi> ok. re-asking question:
[12:51:11] <nix_bpi> Best practice for creating a blank jquery object list to add elements to?
[12:51:28] <taplar> is there a way other than $() ?
[12:51:29] <nix_bpi> I have: var $objectList = $();
[12:51:30] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:51:39] <robertmaxrees> the "best practice" there is to not do that in the first place.
[12:51:44] <taplar> ^^^
[12:53:07] <nix_bpi> ok. so what should I do then to pass on a separate list to a method?
[12:53:22] <robertmaxrees> "pass on a separate list to a method"?
[12:53:23] <taplar> that's very generic
[12:53:25] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:53:31] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to grab a subset of elements?
[12:55:17] <nix_bpi> yes. I'm grabbing anywhere between 3 and 15 divs with a selector depending on parent container. out of those, I only want ones that are specially marked with a class of "clickMeOnly" or something. the problem is, there is a clone of that div being made so that we have a div at the top and the bottom of the content area to make a weird expanding drawer effect
[12:55:26] <robertmaxrees> use .filter() for that.
[12:55:49] <robertmaxrees> and/or a delegated handler.
[12:58:51] <taplar> what is an expanding drawer effect?
[12:59:01] <robertmaxrees> probably an accordion
[13:01:57] <nix_bpi> accordion of sorts
[13:02:07] <nix_bpi> but with a certain visual effect.
[13:02:22] <robertmaxrees> but it's basically and accordion, yeah?
[13:02:44] <robertmaxrees> f*an
[13:03:03] <nix_bpi> sort of. I'm not actually using accordion.
[13:03:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:03:11] <robertmaxrees> so then what is it?
[13:03:17] <robertmaxrees> do you have a fiddle or something?
[13:03:28] <nix_bpi> I can't do that with this code.
[13:03:40] <nix_bpi> err.. i can't share it.
[13:03:45] <taplar> things can be an accordion without using jquery ui
[13:03:51] <robertmaxrees> it's super hard to help because you're being relatively generic, hence the questions.
[13:04:28] <nix_bpi> I understand that. and I truly appreciate the help you guys have given. I think I ended up overcomplicating things by adding in that second empty list
[13:04:36] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:04:46] <robertmaxrees> you don't need empty jquery objects fwiw.
[13:06:28] <taplar> i guess my question is the statement included 'the problem is'.  why is it a problem?
[13:07:35] <taplar> like, the problem is two girls like me.  why is that a problem?  they're sisters.  oooooh
[13:12:31] <taplar> which is a lie.  don't let it intimidate you guys to not talking
[13:12:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:12:44] <robertmaxrees> this guy
[13:12:48] <taplar> :)
[13:12:57] <nix_bpi> hell.. i'll talk regardless....
[13:13:04] <taplar> i had a couple bad ones this morning
[13:13:14] <taplar> *ahem*
[13:13:18] <nix_bpi> I really need to find a mopar irc channel... I'll talk some s**t up then.... <3 my charger lol
[13:13:26] <taplar> why do native africans hate doctors?
[13:14:02] <taplar> because all the doctors ask is if they hurt an ab, or ridge, or a knee
[13:14:26] <robertmaxrees> wouldn't that be native australians?
[13:14:48] <taplar> who do i look like?  *tries to remember that australian guy*
[13:14:58] <robertmaxrees> hahaa
[13:15:05] <robertmaxrees> aaaand /thatguy
[13:15:08] <nix_bpi> Crocodile Dundee?
[13:15:12] <taplar> lol
[13:15:13] <taplar> sure
[13:15:22] <nix_bpi> Paul Hogan
[13:15:58] <robertmaxrees> Saxton Hale?
[13:15:59] <taplar> the other one was more stupid, but you have to like pokemon for it (probably).  It was I wish the evolution chain in pokemon went kakuna -> mataitai
[13:16:14] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[13:16:21] <robertmaxrees> this guy
[13:17:14] <nix_bpi> I thought it was hakuna matata
[13:17:43] <robertmaxrees> kakuna is a pokemon iirc
[13:18:03] <nix_bpi> oh. my bad.
[13:18:20] <nix_bpi> I don't know pokemon... magic the gathering was my CCG drug of choice
[13:18:38] <robertmaxrees> i remember playing magic years ago.
[13:19:25] <nix_bpi> yeah. I did too... that's why I failed out of college back in 1996. ended up going back to the same school 10 years later and finally graduating in 2009 with my BSBA
[13:19:49] <robertmaxrees> hah.
[13:19:58] <nix_bpi> I was clean of those infernal cards until 2002, and i started buying again... got rid of them.. started buying again 2 months ago lol
[13:21:42] <Duikb00t-home> I am looking for a plugin that can give ma gallery like this: http://demo.stylishthemes.co/diva/#
[13:22:29] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:22:37] <robertmaxrees> you'll be building that yourself.
[13:22:54] <Duikb00t-home> So far I have the js part done :)
[13:23:00] <Duikb00t-home> CSS*
[13:23:01] <Duikb00t-home> lol
[13:23:10] <robertmaxrees> then build the js and html?
[13:23:14] <Duikb00t-home> Im wondering how to make them 'scroll' based on eachother
[13:23:26] <robertmaxrees> "based on eachother" or "based on the mouse"
[13:25:15] <robertmaxrees> woops
[13:25:49] <Duikb00t-home> hmm
[13:26:43] <taplar> Steve Irwin
[13:27:06] <systemfault> Now Steve Irdead
[13:27:21] <taplar> woah, harsh
[13:27:54] <MassDebates> Steve Irwin
[13:27:56] <nix_bpi> that's cruel...
[13:28:06] <nix_bpi> it's like a spike through the chest
[13:28:16] <MassDebates> Yeah didnt he die from a croc or something
[13:28:21] <systemfault> If you play with fire, you'll eventually get burned.
[13:28:32] <systemfault> A spike in through the chest...
[13:28:44] <nix_bpi> he got stabbed through the chest by a manta ray he was "playing" with
[13:28:51] <nix_bpi> horrible way to die though
[13:29:31] <MassDebates> is it painful?
[13:29:37] <robertmaxrees> it would've been.
[13:29:48] <MassDebates> I mean
[13:29:49] <MassDebates> like
[13:29:57] <MassDebates> Does anyone have any experience fucking with manta rays?
[13:30:06] <MassDebates> and wth i thought they were harmles
[13:30:10] <MassDebates> harmless*
[13:30:11] <taplar> *grins* well, now that you asked
[13:30:13] <nix_bpi> I have a cousin who swam with them.
[13:30:17] <MassDebates> Like Daddy-Long-Legs
[13:30:22] <MassDebates> LOL taplar
[13:30:26] <nix_bpi> you see photos where they look like they are smiling while laying on the person's back
[13:30:39] <robertmaxrees> and it was a stingray
[13:31:07] <nix_bpi> http://i.imgur.com/3DYHsAT.jpg
[13:31:24] <systemfault> Love that stingray smile
[13:31:37] <nix_bpi> you're right. it was a stingray
[13:31:52] <robertmaxrees> dude got stabbed a whole bunch by the thing.
[13:31:53] <Duikb00t-home> robertmaxrees:  So a mouse-event ;)
[13:31:54] <robertmaxrees> pretty savage
[13:32:02] <MassDebates> Wth
[13:32:16] <MassDebates> I cant find any videos of one of these things, manta, stingray, or otherwise, actually -stinging- shit
[13:32:27] <MassDebates> Hell, I can find illegal porn more easily than this
[13:32:35] <robertmaxrees> irwin's death was the only one ever caught on tape doing it.
[13:32:44] <MassDebates> I CANT FIND THE DUDE DYING EITHER LMAO
[13:32:47] <robertmaxrees> and the family asked for all copies to get destroyed.
[13:32:49] <robertmaxrees> thats why.
[13:32:49] <taplar> no, you can't
[13:32:51] <robertmaxrees> it's on purpose.
[13:32:53] <MassDebates> oh dman
[13:32:58] <MassDebates> Now I'm calling conspiracy
[13:33:00] <robertmaxrees> they didn't want to make a spectacle out of it.
[13:33:08] <MassDebates> ... the dude is steve irwin
[13:33:13] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter.
[13:33:17] <MassDebates> He made a life's living out of being a spectacle
[13:33:26] <robertmaxrees> his family still has a right to ask that his death not be made into a circus.
[13:33:29] <taplar> personally i don't really want to see video of anyone dieing, :|
[13:33:32] <MassDebates> Fair enough
[13:33:53] <taplar> we already have ol' yellar
[13:34:44] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:34:58] <taplar> and where the red fern grows!
[13:35:06] <taplar> why so many dog dieing movies?!
[13:35:20] <robertmaxrees> aaaaanyway
[13:35:24] <taplar> lmao
[13:36:08] <taplar> sorry, distracted from Duikb00t-home 's q
[13:36:17] <Duikb00t-home> eeeeeeeeh :D
[13:36:22] <Duikb00t-home> o/ taplar
[13:36:22] <taplar> no?
[13:36:47] <Duikb00t-home> Fixing some CSS atm : https://jsfiddle.net/noLn3827/
[13:37:30] <taplar> ooooh,reactive!
[13:37:47] <Duikb00t-home> :D
[13:38:03] <Duikb00t-home> This is what it should become: demo.stylishthemes.co/diva/#
[13:38:08] <Duikb00t-home> http://demo.stylishthemes.co/diva/# ;P
[13:38:13] <Duikb00t-home> but im unsure about the scrolling currently.
[13:38:17] <robertmaxrees> why not just pay for the theme then?
[13:38:29] <Duikb00t-home> Because I made my own api implementation etc ect  I don't need wordprss
[13:38:35] <Duikb00t-home> I only need that gallery effect.
[13:38:42] <Duikb00t-home> Else I had already bought it.
[13:38:44] <robertmaxrees> you could still buy it an adapt it.
[13:38:50] <robertmaxrees> but alright.
[13:38:51] <Duikb00t-home> meh
[13:38:51] <taplar> mmmmm, "Nice Girl"
[13:38:55] <Duikb00t-home> :D
[13:39:40] <taplar> that's kinda a weird ui, but kinda cool
[13:39:55] <taplar> weird in that adjacent things scroll too
[13:40:11] <robertmaxrees> scrolling content based on mouse potision shouldn't be too hard.
[13:41:05] <Duikb00t-home> No but. . .  I think in my example I first have to get that CSS issue fixed with overflow: scroll on *each column.
[13:41:41] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[13:41:51] <taplar> woah!
[13:42:10] <taplar> do this.  right click on the header part and inspect element.  the whole page goes crazy while it opens
[13:42:18] <taplar> at least in ff
[13:42:41] <Duikb00t-home> That Diva theme?
[13:42:46] <taplar> ya
[13:42:49] <Duikb00t-home> yes indeed
[13:42:50] <Duikb00t-home> saw it too
[13:43:41] <Duikb00t-home> transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.1, 0.57, 0.1, 1); transition-duration: 0ms; transform: translate(0px, -2679.17px) translateZ(0px);
[13:43:44] <Duikb00t-home> hmm
[13:45:24] <Duikb00t-home> It's hard to get 1 column csrolling just with css > <
[13:47:20] <robertmaxrees> #css probably has some ideas
[13:49:46] <Duikb00t-home> Allright! On a roll1!!! https://jsfiddle.net/noLn3827/4/
[13:59:33] <MassDebates> um
[13:59:42] <MassDebates> Excuse me, did someone say #css ?
[13:59:47] * MassDebates coughs violently
[13:59:49] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:00:01] <MassDebates> Duikb00t-home:  still need halp?
[14:00:06] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[14:00:11] <Duikb00t-home> The cSS part is making progress :D
[14:00:15] <Duikb00t-home> it's just that scrolling thing
[14:00:17] <taplar> the @media loves css
[14:00:18] <robertmaxrees> no but really, if you need css help, check out the entire channel dedicated to the subject ;)
[14:00:22] <MassDebates> I may not be as much of a wizard as Robdgreat or taplar but I can kick ass with CSS
[14:00:30] <MassDebates> Feel free to PM
[14:00:36] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:00:53] <MassDebates> (with jquery)
[14:00:58] <Robdgreat> ah, I'm ok, but I wouldn't consider myself a wizard
[14:01:07] <robertmaxrees> why not allow other people to learn from their case?
[14:01:14] <MassDebates> I don't mind helping him here.
[14:01:18] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: because what's the fun in everyone benefiting?
[14:01:20] <taplar> <-- magi.  wizards are social butterflies
[14:01:24] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused
[14:01:56] <robertmaxrees> i keep suggesting a channel dedicated to the subject but there seems to be a push against that,.
[14:02:11] <MassDebates> I don't mind him going to #css - they're very capable too.
[14:02:20] <MassDebates> I'm just swankier.
[14:02:28] <nix_bpi> ok. have code presentation. need to turn this off. talk to you guys and gals in a bit
[14:02:35] <MassDebates> Besides, too much #jquery and they typically send them over here anyways.
[14:02:42] <robertmaxrees> heh, right.
[14:02:44] <taplar> oooh, a code review
[14:02:46] <robertmaxrees> all about being topical :)
[14:02:47] <MassDebates> console.log('test'); can be seen as "too much jquery"
[14:02:53] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[14:03:05] <robertmaxrees> that's their discretion.  we tend to prefer keeping it OT here, too.
[14:03:05] <taplar> huh?
[14:03:21] <MassDebates> Fair 'nuff. At any rate, I'm just here.
[14:03:34] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[14:03:57] <taplar> guess it's my turn to be lost.  what's a console.log got to do with jquery?
[14:04:15] <robertmaxrees> he's saying that #css tends to quickly push people to the correct channel.
[14:04:19] <MassDebates> My bad! $(function(){ is what I meant to grab. Triple click was fast.
[14:04:21] <taplar> aaaah
[14:04:37] <MassDebates> I've seen people get turned away if theres -anything- in the javascript window.
[14:04:43] <robertmaxrees> which we should generally to, too.
[14:04:46] <MassDebates> IN whihc #jquery or ##javascript is the destination for redirection.
[14:05:32] <taplar> i think we all redirect, unless it's super slow, and even then we may
[14:05:34] <MassDebates> At any rate, the only reason why I said something is because I've helped Duikb00t-home several times before on other channels with several #CSS problems, including on #wordpress, and here
[14:05:56] <Duikb00t-home> Have I missed something?
[14:05:57] <MassDebates> I don't mind him going to #css - I welcome it, but I figured there must be a reason why he asked the question here
[14:06:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:06:14] <robertmaxrees> the reason's kind of irrelevant, but alright.
[14:06:27] <Duikb00t-home> Sorry, I was trying solving my issue.
[14:06:33] <taplar> for shame
[14:06:51] <Duikb00t-home> "
[14:06:51] <Duikb00t-home> console.log('test'); can be seen as "too much jquery" "  lol :D
[14:07:58] <MassDebates> I want to input but I don't want to be too off-topic from the channel
[14:08:07] <robertmaxrees> i'm so confused lol
[14:08:23] <Duikb00t-home> Now building the overlay functionality. :-)
[14:08:40] <MassDebates> Fuck it, I'll just say it.
[14:08:51] <MassDebates> You can clip out those bars easily with some positioning and some margins
[14:08:51] <taplar> cheese is gouda?
[14:08:59] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[14:09:03] <MassDebates> There I said it
[14:09:06] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[14:09:21] <robertmaxrees> not really sure what the big buildup was for, but alright.
[14:10:13] <MassDebates> Was just being cautious after you mentioned he go to the channel and get support there. Didn't want to undermine the request!
[14:10:29] <robertmaxrees> it's fine to give small bits of guidance here and there.
[14:10:46] <robertmaxrees> just a better idea to guide pepole to the topically relevant place when it gets into much more than that.
[14:10:47] <robertmaxrees> that's all.
[14:11:04] <MassDebates> Come to think of it, why are you using any scripting at all Duikb00t-home ?
[14:11:21] <MassDebates> This is a passive effect. Why not use css where it shines the most?
[14:11:29] <taplar> "when it gets into much more"
[14:11:40] <robertmaxrees> because the original thing he's building will likely make use of JS.
[14:11:41] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[14:12:00] <Duikb00t-home> MassDebates:  Absolutely right!
[14:12:12] <Duikb00t-home> But I have no idea how I could repeat that gallery over and over again with css ;)
[14:12:15] <taplar> yeah, i can see how css would trigger scroll, i just don't know how you would preserve the scroll after the scroll stops without js
[14:12:22] <taplar> would/could
[14:12:26] <Duikb00t-home> THAT :)
[14:12:34] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[14:12:56] <MassDebates> Are you pulling things live?
[14:13:04] <MassDebates> anything ajaxxy?
[14:13:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:13:20] <robertmaxrees> this guy
[14:13:32] <MassDebates> Sorry, right
[14:14:00] <robertmaxrees> lol it's all good.
[14:14:23] <Duikb00t-home> Me?
[14:14:26] <robertmaxrees> ah
[14:14:29] <robertmaxrees> *nah
[14:14:32] <Duikb00t-home> ok
[14:14:32] <MassDebates> No, I'm in trouble for being off-topic
[14:14:36] <robertmaxrees> hh?
[14:14:38] <robertmaxrees> you're not.
[14:14:40] <MassDebates> They'll be beating me with sugar canes later.
[14:14:43] <robertmaxrees> uh
[14:14:51] <MassDebates> (I'll like it too)
[14:14:54] <robertmaxrees> you're not in trouble, but ok.
[14:15:19] <taplar> dude if i can derail the room with steve irwin for a good while, you talking css for a few minutes is no biggie
[14:15:36] <MassDebates> I still really want to find that video
[14:15:43] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't exist.
[14:15:45] <MassDebates> Not that steve died from it, I just wana see a mantaray sting a person!
[14:15:51] <robertmaxrees> *stingray
[14:15:52] <MassDebates> Sounds exhillerating!
[14:16:02] <MassDebates> Whatever! I WANNA SEE A FRISBEE FISH FUCK SHIT UP
[14:16:04] <robertmaxrees> and that's macabre as hell.
[14:16:07] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[14:16:07] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:16:09] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[14:16:46] <snover> what is going on in here.
[14:16:57] <robertmaxrees> i'm not entirely sure at this point.
[14:18:18] <MassDebates> wait, so it's just like a sharp knife on a tail with some poison?
[14:18:27] <MassDebates> That sounds incredibly boring.
[14:18:34] <MassDebates> I thought it was like an electric eel or something
[14:19:15] <Duikb00t-home> mgmt
[14:19:21] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[14:19:24] <Duikb00t-home> shock me like an electric eel
[14:19:28] * Duikb00t-home baby girl
[14:19:30] <Duikb00t-home> oeh aahh
[14:19:40] <MassDebates> lol
[14:20:39] <Duikb00t-home> https://youtu.be/MmZexg8sxyk?t=59s > Electric Eel
[14:20:41] <Duikb00t-home> oeh ah
[14:20:53] <MassDebates> lol
[14:21:16] <Duikb00t-home> What an awesome song.
[14:21:35] <robertmaxrees> aka houdini from foster the people
[14:21:46] <Duikb00t-home> pumped up kicks!
[14:22:39] <taplar> here, this should tide over your stingray video desire https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5FEj9U-CJM&list=PLOHbM4GGWADc5bZgvbivvttAuWGow6h05&index=7
[14:22:57] <Duikb00t-home> hahaha
[14:22:58] <robertmaxrees> hah, ze frank.
[14:23:01] <taplar> (btw, all the true facts videos are awesome)
[14:23:12] <robertmaxrees> *all of ze frank's videos are awesome
[14:24:07] <MassDebates> lmao
[14:24:12] <MassDebates> The color wavelengths
[14:24:22] <MassDebates> However, the mantis shrimp can detect 5,000
[14:24:39] <MassDebates> (just kidding, only 12)
[14:25:57] <MassDebates> holy shit, .22 caliber bullet punching hands on this thing!?
[14:25:57] <donjohnny> hello all, i'm invoking a $.post() of jQuery, works fine on my desktop, but the function() does not work on mobile for some reason. http://pastebin.com/z05eG3L7 am I doing something wrong? Does jQuery require certain headers from my nodejs server?
[14:26:21] <robertmaxrees> are you saying you're not reaching the success callback?
[14:26:39] <robertmaxrees> also: is the server also your desktop?
[14:27:35] <donjohnny> robertmaxrees: exactly, it's not reaching the callback :( yes, both the webserver and nodejs are on the same desktop
[14:28:40] <robertmaxrees> fwiw pbar(func);
[14:28:46] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing func defined.
[14:29:10] <robertmaxrees> either way, i'd slap on a .catch() and check out what the error is.
[14:57:08] <dglambert> yo
[15:00:34] <robertmaxrees> soup
[15:09:33] <RM982> Yo! If I make a get() request and the server returns a PHP array, is there a way to make that output redable by js?
[15:10:26] <RM982> I guess I'm not returning any output to the browser
[15:11:30] <robertmaxrees> RM982 js and php are separate languages :)
[15:11:36] <robertmaxrees> convert it to JSON
[15:12:43] <RM982> so the php srcipt should return json_encode($my_array()) ?
[15:12:57] <RM982> and I would get a plain string
[15:13:04] <RM982> is that right?
[15:13:06] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[15:13:19] <RM982> alright thank you
[15:34:10] <donjohnny> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/TyXNNEGQ this is the error I got
[15:34:55] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[15:35:13] <robertmaxrees> oh, hitting that thing via mobile?
[15:35:29] <donjohnny> yes exactly
[15:35:36] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:35:40] <robertmaxrees> something here seems off.
[15:35:49] <robertmaxrees> how'd you get this?
[15:36:35] <donjohnny> I added a catch: .catch(function(err) {
[15:36:36] <donjohnny>         $("#blockchain_receive").html("Error" + arrayPrint(err));
[15:37:14] <donjohnny> arrayPrint just iterates through the object and shows it in a nice table
[15:37:28] <robertmaxrees> you know there's a console.table(), right?
[15:37:52] <robertmaxrees> and have you tried to emulate mobile?  if so, are you getting the same error?
[15:38:29] <donjohnny> how do I go about that ?
[15:38:37] <robertmaxrees> chromne.
[15:38:41] <robertmaxrees> it has a mobile emulation mode.
[15:38:51] <robertmaxrees> https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/
[15:41:51] <donjohnny> robertmaxrees, tried that, but no error
[15:41:57] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[15:43:07] <robertmaxrees> wait what url are you hitting?
[15:43:13] <robertmaxrees> and that's the url of the API?
[15:44:17] <donjohnny> the url is local: http://192.168.1.6:1234/
[15:44:40] <robertmaxrees> and the API you're hitting?
[15:47:43] <donjohnny> its a nodejs, returning json or an error
[15:48:01] <robertmaxrees> right, but what's the url for that "nodejs"?
[15:48:11] <robertmaxrees> trying to figure out if you're hitting CORS somehow.
[15:48:25] <shoky_> he has it in the first paste, seems same origin
[15:48:27] <robertmaxrees> or if you've got a bad config or osmething.
[15:48:37] <robertmaxrees> shoky_ right but then why would it work on his local machine>?
[15:49:01] <shoky_> mm did he say it does?
[15:49:04] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[15:49:19] <shoky_> oh right
[15:49:26] <robertmaxrees> oh wait some browsers bypass some settings based on the IP.
[15:51:45] <shoky_> that's a regular lan ip though
[15:52:24] <robertmaxrees> just tossin' out the idea.
[15:52:56] <taplar> is the mobile device hitting that page directly and doing the api call, or is it calling the api from other url?
[15:53:03] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[15:53:10] <robertmaxrees> things i keep trying to figure out.
[15:53:57] <donjohnny> the page makes the API call directly to the LAN ip on port 1234 (which is a nodejs)
[15:54:04] <robertmaxrees> lol.
[15:54:08] <donjohnny> the page itself was served by an apache server on :80
[15:54:12] <robertmaxrees> that's it.
[15:54:14] <robertmaxrees> CORS
[15:54:19] <shoky_> donjohnny: you're were logging the xhr object, not the error
[15:54:20] <robertmaxrees> port, protocol, and domain gotta match.
[15:54:39] <robertmaxrees> you can set CORS headers on the node api instance if you want.
[15:54:56] <shoky_> donjohnny:  the error is the 3rd argument to the fail handler
[15:58:06] <donjohnny> robertmaxrees: but then why would it work on my chrome? I had to set res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://localhost'); to make it work
[15:58:30] <robertmaxrees> because you're pointing to localhost.
[16:02:22] <donjohnny> *facepalm*
[16:02:44] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:02:56] <taplar> orcan man!
[16:05:08] <donjohnny> I totally missed that! Thanks for helping me solve this issue
[16:05:30] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:05:34] <robertmaxrees> all good :)
[16:09:52] <plentybinary> is there a way to make jquery draggable elements scroll up when you drag them past the top of a scrollable element? kind of hard to explain what i mean, but with an a tag if you drag it to the top of the page the pag scrolls up. Once you make an element dragable this functionality is lost
[16:33:00] <plamb_> can you pass a jquery selector into .not
[16:33:07] <plamb_> or does it have to be a javascript selector
[16:33:07] <robertmaxrees> "jquery selector"?
[16:33:10] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:33:17] <taplar> .not('.myclass')
[16:33:30] <robertmaxrees> what is a "javascript selector"?
[16:34:01] <plamb_> $(...) vs document.getElementByClass(...)
[16:34:05] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:34:15] <plamb_> taplar solved what iw as looking for though
[16:34:22] <plamb_> you can just pass '.myClass'
[16:34:25] <robertmaxrees> you know js has querySelectorAll, right?
[16:34:41] <robertmaxrees> and all jquery selectors are css (shrug)
[16:37:59] <plamb_> can i pass just a class selector to .filter
[16:38:06] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[16:38:07] <plamb_> .filter('.myClass')
[16:38:12] <robertmaxrees> you can pass any selector to filter.
[16:38:27] <plamb_> was thinking it'd need something like
[16:38:53] <plamb_> filter(function(){return $(this).hasClass('.myClass')})
[16:39:00] <robertmaxrees> you can do that, too.
[16:39:06] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[16:39:52] <taplar> as albert einstein once said.  "she's my mama"
[16:40:45] <taplar> wait, did einstein speak english?
[16:41:37] <robertmaxrees> he could yeah
[16:42:34] <taplar> awesome, though apparently according to this site he started learning after age 54.  so my statement was probably wrong.  :(
[16:43:54] <robertmaxrees> haha
[16:49:50] <taplar> things that make you go hmm
[16:50:29] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:57:37] <robertmaxrees> how is it only 2?!
[16:57:59] <taplar> idk, but i'm hungry for a burger or something
[16:58:39] <taplar> that grilled salmon, while delicious, didn't fill the bill
[17:02:36] <realnot> hi guys, given an input element like here: http://dpaste.com/3YB2WNT how I can select the i.fa element inside the input-group-addon element?
[17:03:00] <robertmaxrees> .input-group-addon .fa
[17:03:07] <robertmaxrees> same way you would with css
[17:05:25] <realnot> uhm.. I used next().children('fa')
[17:06:31] <taplar> so what is your starting point?
[17:06:44] <taplar> in what context are you doing this lookup?
[17:06:49] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:06:53] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:07:04] <taplar> and also i'd recommend putting another class on that bad boy rather than selecting by fa
[17:07:43] <plamb_> why does this fiddle return an error: post request msg on click
[17:07:46] <plamb_> oh wait
[17:08:04] <realnot> uhmmm
[17:08:04] <plamb_> didnt include jquery LoL
[17:08:06] <realnot> it sucks
[17:08:29] <taplar> while descriptive, not very informative, ;)
[17:08:32] <robertmaxrees> realnot i generally .closest() for a shared parent and then .find() the element i want from there.
[17:08:49] <gambl0re> hello?
[17:08:59] <plamb_> robertmaxrees: how would a "restore" functionality to the .fileFormat <a>'s once the download button has been clicked?
[17:09:01] <plamb_> https://jsfiddle.net/nm6kzqq9/2/
[17:09:12] <realnot> robertmaxrees: http://dpaste.com/1NY6AVS
[17:09:14] <robertmaxrees> plamb huh?
[17:09:28] <plamb_> because i've done e.preventDefault() on click
[17:09:29] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean "how"?
[17:09:37] <plamb_> so when someone clicks again to actually get the file
[17:09:43] <plamb_> it would still preventDefault no?
[17:09:47] <taplar> realnot: what is 'element'?
[17:09:54] <robertmaxrees> plamb don't bind to .download.
[17:09:55] <robertmaxrees> easy.
[17:10:03] <robertmaxrees> bind to the specific elements.
[17:10:05] <realnot> I want create a swapper icon on form validation: when the form is valid, show fa-check, otherwise, show fa-exclamation-circle
[17:10:07] <plamb_> so bind to the a that doesnt have a class?
[17:10:23] <realnot> taplar: element is the input element of the form (the one is valid/wrong)
[17:10:41] <robertmaxrees> plamb or give that anchor a good class, either/or.
[17:10:55] <taplar> ok, so do what robertmaxrees suggested.  $(element).closest('sharedparentselector').find('otherelementselector')
[17:11:01] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:11:41] <realnot> taplar, robertmaxrees: the problem is similar to this one: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19541662/jquery-validate-plugin-only-success-show-tick-image-otherwise-on-error-show
[17:11:58] <robertmaxrees> realnot so then where are you lost?
[17:12:19] <realnot> robertmaxrees: I need to use find() after closest?
[17:12:35] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[17:12:59] <robertmaxrees> you're getting that parent and then finding the descendent
[17:13:59] <gambl0re> hi robert....
[17:14:06] <realnot> robertmaxrees: it doesn't works
[17:14:08] <robertmaxrees> you told me not to talk to you the other day.
[17:14:11] <robertmaxrees> realnot show me :)
[17:14:16] <plamb_> yeah i was here for that
[17:14:21] <robertmaxrees> realnot are you using closest and find correctly?
[17:14:25] <realnot> the class is attached on parent not inside the fa element
[17:14:31] <robertmaxrees> realnot huh?
[17:14:51] <robertmaxrees> realnot are you familiar with how closest works?
[17:15:04] <realnot> robertmaxrees: no
[17:15:06] <realnot> robertmaxrees: http://dpaste.com/32ARWAD
[17:15:36] <robertmaxrees> right so .closest('form-group') is looking for <form-group>, not an element with that class.
[17:15:40] <robertmaxrees> slap a period in front of that.
[17:15:43] <robertmaxrees> samne with the .find()
[17:17:51] <realnot> robertmaxrees, it works!
[17:17:57] <robertmaxrees> realnot awesome!
[17:18:21] <realnot> thanks to you :D
[17:18:25] <robertmaxrees> and taplar :)
[17:18:36] <taplar> no no, i'm ok
[17:18:40] <robertmaxrees> haha
[17:19:02] <realnot> gh
[17:19:13] <realnot> robertmaxrees: http://dpaste.com/0V1SQ9F
[17:19:27] <robertmaxrees> sup?
[17:22:21] <taplar> should the highlight classes be swapped?
[17:22:39] <taplar> valid <-> error ?
[17:23:24] <realnot> taplar: yes
[17:23:44] <realnot> robertmaxrees: awesome :)
[17:24:08] <realnot> taplar: are two callback: http://stackoverflow.com/a/19547326/2653437
[17:24:55] <realnot> taplar: it could be written better?
[17:25:20] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[17:25:51] <taplar> what i was saying earlier about finding on another class other than fa was more for readability
[17:26:36] <taplar> and you might decide in the future to use something other than font awesome which you'd have to change.  granted you'd have to change this anyway to change out the class toggles, but... *shrug*
[17:26:50] <robertmaxrees> imo don't eeven swap classes.
[17:26:56] <robertmaxrees> make elements that you hide/show.
[17:27:15] <taplar> oh, true.  then it would be really decoupled
[17:27:47] <taplar> and changing the parent class would be all you'd need
[17:30:03] <realnot> taplar: you're right
[17:30:34] <realnot> instead of `fa` I can use just a <span>>
[17:30:35] <realnot> ?
[17:30:58] <taplar> if you go the show hide route you don't need to target the child
[17:31:04] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:31:04] <realnot> robertmaxrees: what?
[17:31:08] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[17:31:09] <taplar> you build your css rules to show/hide them depending on the class on the parent
[17:31:22] <realnot> yes
[17:31:32] <realnot> form-group
[17:32:18] <taplar> .form-group.valid valid-icon { display: inherit; } .form-group.valid error-icon { display: none; }
[17:32:23] <taplar> or something, and flipped for error
[17:32:35] <taplar> crap, missed the '.' on the icon class, but you get it
[17:36:14] <realnot> taplar: ok thanks!
[17:38:51] <fakey> so... code.jquery.com too many redirects... being looked at?
[17:39:06] <taplar> :/ this is happening frequently now
[17:39:09] <robertmaxrees> should be fine now.
[17:39:14] <robertmaxrees> it was busted last week.
[17:39:22] <fakey> some work but not https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js
[17:39:42] <robertmaxrees> that works here.
[17:39:53] <robertmaxrees> clear your local dns cche
[17:42:42] <fakey2> flushed dns, released and renewed. I restarted earlier too. Other users in my location had no problem until refreshing a few times, then it failed
[17:43:08] <robertmaxrees> browser?
[17:43:14] <robertmaxrees> and are you behind a proxy?
[17:45:20] <fakey2> No proxy. And hey, looks like it's back now. Might have taken time to propagate to my ISP's dns
[17:45:33] <robertmaxrees> there were issues last week.
[17:45:43] <robertmaxrees> wonder if it was residual from that.
[17:47:19] <fakey2> Could be, though it didn't happen until today. There was also a random tweet today about the issue with version 1.11.3
[17:47:21] <fakey2> https://twitter.com/BrandonGiesing/status/808425960521535488
[17:47:53] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[17:48:03] <robertmaxrees> the infra channel seems quiet (shrug)
[17:48:21] <robertmaxrees> wonder if it's problems at stackpath
[17:53:30] <UnevenCamb> Hey, could somebody look at this single line of code and see why it's not loading?
[17:53:31] <UnevenCamb> <script scr="owl-carousel/owl.carousel.js"></script>
[17:53:43] <robertmaxrees> src
[17:53:47] <robertmaxrees> not scr
[17:54:20] <UnevenCamb> THANKS! :D
[17:54:29] <robertmaxrees> short for "source"
[17:55:28] <UnevenCamb> Awesome! Thanks man. :)
[18:23:37] <taplar> mmm, awkwardCough made an interesting little holiday stocking thing that looks like a cast out of tape and....stuff, not sure what
[18:24:19] <taplar> i asked him, with a canadian accent, what's that aboot ?
[18:25:27] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:27:50] * taplar strums his guitar
[18:28:18] <taplar> 3:30 in the morning..... and not a soul on the site...   irc is looking like a ghost town... on a moonless sunday(?) night
[18:28:44] <robertmaxrees> heh whaa song is that supposed to be?
[18:28:49] <realnot> lol
[18:28:52] <taplar> garth brooks, thunder rolls
[18:28:56] <robertmaxrees> goddamn.
[18:32:45] <UnevenCamb> am I right in thinking that the customizing bit is jquery nonsense, right? http://owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/index.html#customizing
[18:33:00] <robertmaxrees> "jquery nontense"?
[18:33:02] <robertmaxrees> *nonsense
[18:33:51] <UnevenCamb> like, today is my first outing with it, so I'm not up to scratch with the lingo
[18:33:51] <robertmaxrees> UnevenCamb clarify?
[18:34:12] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean by "nonsense" though?
[18:34:21] <UnevenCamb> but if I want to change the opens it says I can customize, it's refering to editing the jquery, and not putting it in the HTML, right?
[18:34:34] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:34:39] <robertmaxrees> you wouldn't edit jquery.
[18:34:44] <robertmaxrees> you'd add those to the init options.
[18:35:04] <robertmaxrees> in other words, you'd edit your JS.
[18:35:18] <UnevenCamb> Oh, that makes life a bit easier
[18:35:27] <robertmaxrees> since jquery is javascript.
[18:37:17] <UnevenCamb> so if I've got <script src="owl-carousel/main.js"></script> in the HTML, does it go into the main.js or inbetween the > and <?
[18:37:23] <robertmaxrees> neither.
[18:37:25] <robertmaxrees> you link a new file.
[18:37:38] <UnevenCamb> is this a new js file?
[18:37:41] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[18:37:56] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you could just do it in the script tags if you really wanted, but new files are generally best.
[18:38:16] <taplar> not in that script tag though
[18:38:21] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:39:51] <UnevenCamb> ok, so if I've got jquery-1.9.1.min.js and owl.carousel.js which I've just downloaded from the owlgraphic.com people and main.js which I pasted the code the website told me to paste into it, I need to make a fourth .js, right? Do I literally just put autoPlay: true or do I need to do anything fancy?
[18:40:53] <taplar> edit your main.js file then
[18:41:31] <taplar> and you see on that page all those defaults it lists?
[18:41:57] <taplar> under 3. Defaults
[18:43:23] <UnevenCamb> OH WAIT
[18:43:25] <UnevenCamb> I GET IT
[18:43:30] <UnevenCamb> everything needs a comma after it
[18:43:36] <taplar> if there are multiple
[18:43:46] <taplar> those are defaults though, you don't have to give all those
[18:43:55] <taplar> you only have to give the ones you want to change
[18:47:13] <robertmaxrees> objects.
[19:00:29] <taplar> Is it "What men treat women as?"
[19:00:29] <taplar> I want the daily double!
[19:00:51] * taplar is going crazyer
[22:19:10] <hilltop> Has anyone had problems with links inside JQ sortable li's not firing?
[22:19:49] <hilltop> I have an event listener that, if killed, will allow them to fire. Haven't ever had this issue before; not sure how to debug
[22:45:19] <sdwrage> Hey all. I am using a twitter bootstrap modal window to manage some data. I have a button inside the modal that simulates the same click that was used to open the modal up. Only problem is that it closes my modal window.
[22:45:31] <sdwrage> is there a good way to prevent that?
