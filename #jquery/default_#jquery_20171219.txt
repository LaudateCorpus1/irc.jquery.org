[05:56:18] <bbrala> Hi everyone, i´m experimenting rewriting my jQuery plugin to es6 using webpack and bable to build and transpile the code. I´m looking for the correct way to enable $.fn and $.[plugin] in the jquery scope when the plugin in integrated in other applications. I can´t really find any good resources on this. Does anyone know how, or know of plugins that i could check out as an example?
[05:56:40] <bbrala> The branch is located at; https://github.com/swisnl/jQuery-contextMenu/tree/es6-experiment
[05:58:01] <bbrala> An application where i see a problem is with the following lines
[05:58:31] <bbrala> import iconRenderer from './iconRenderer'
[05:58:31] <bbrala> ;import $ from 'jquery';
[05:58:31] <bbrala> import 'jquery-contextmenu';
[05:58:49] <bbrala> which doesn´t expose $.contextMenu appearantly
[07:54:26] <WhirledPress> can you still create custom selectors in jquery using $.expr ?
[07:56:04] <Cork> WhirledPress: $.expr[] is deprecated
[07:56:12] <Cork> but there is $.expr.psudos
[07:57:32] <WhirledPress> wondering if I can use the isInViewport git to establish the :inview selector?
[07:57:33] <WhirledPress> https://github.com/zeusdeux/isInViewport/blob/master/src/index.js
[07:59:51] <Cork> it will still work, though it will break in jquery 4 as [':'] is scheduled to be removed then
[08:01:12] <WhirledPress> thanks. I guess I'll just manually check
[08:06:27] <cocoloco> hi
[08:06:57] <cocoloco> I'm trying to set an image src dynamically with jQuery(el).attr('src', URL)
[08:07:26] <cocoloco> the problem is that the URL contains some params and the & gets encoded to &amp;
[08:07:29] <cocoloco> how can I avoid that?
[08:17:11] <karstenk> Hi! How can I trigger password.addEventListener('input', function () {})  when document ready?
[09:10:05] <AdamPDotty> karstenk: Got an answer yet?
[11:24:17] <Elirips> hello. There is 'on('load', ...)' to trigger when an image has been loaded, but is there also some 'on('error', ..)' or such to trigger when an image failed loading?
[11:25:29] <taplar> no that i'm aware of
[11:26:23] <taplar> you could do a quick head request to the url to see if you get back a good response though.  might be one way to check it
[12:24:04] <vish93> Hi guys I am using PhotoSwipe to create a gallery, but the arrows aren’t showing: https://codepen.io/vishpatel93/pen/JMXpOP wondering if anyone could kindly help me see why
[13:30:16] <Levin^> hi there
[13:30:32] <robertmaxrees> hello
[13:30:43] <Levin^> I need help with a script I have
[13:30:46] <Levin^> http://34.234.87.242/
[13:31:16] <Levin^> if you scroll down to the footer, in the menu, there's an item called "Sites Globais"
[13:31:37] <Levin^> if you click it, it'll open a dropdown
[13:31:53] <Levin^> if you click at any of the items, they don't work properly
[13:32:09] <Levin^> they should open another website at another tab
[13:32:21] <robertmaxrees> where's the related JS?
[13:32:41] <Levin^> here: http://34.234.87.242/wp-content/themes/salient-child/js/scripts.js?ver=4.8.4
[13:32:51] <Levin^> it's the last function.... oh no..
[13:32:56] <Levin^> I forgot it's plain js
[13:33:07] <robertmaxrees> i can still poke.
[13:33:08] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[13:33:10] <Levin^> ok
[13:35:24] <robertmaxrees> erm
[13:35:32] <robertmaxrees> Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.menu-dropdown a')).forEach(function (el) {
[13:35:54] <robertmaxrees> and then you bind clickMenuDropDown to each of those.
[13:36:12] <robertmaxrees> and you're running preventDefault() on those.
[13:36:47] <taplar> took me 2.3 min to load the page...
[13:36:54] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:37:01] <robertmaxrees> gonna have all kinds of perf issues.
[13:37:06] <Levin^> taplar: it's still in development heh
[13:37:14] <robertmaxrees> but yeah.
[13:37:18] <robertmaxrees> see what i'm talking about Levin^?
[13:37:25] <Levin^> trying to
[13:37:55] <taplar> you should at least be gzip'ing in development
[13:38:33] <robertmaxrees> basically, you're saying "for all elements that match '.menu-dropdown a', run this handler which toggles some things and also runs preventDefault
[13:38:47] <robertmaxrees> "
[13:39:11] <Levin^> taplar: I'll config that later
[13:40:00] <Levin^> preventDefault is a mistake here?
[13:40:39] <robertmaxrees> Levin^ for these specific links it is.
[13:40:57] <Levin^> oh..
[13:41:34] <Levin^> it's because if I click it, it runs the parent link
[13:41:40] <Levin^> which is a #
[13:41:48] <robertmaxrees> "the parent link"?
[13:41:50] <taplar> stopPropagation
[13:41:53] <Levin^> heh
[13:41:53] <taplar> not preventDefault
[13:42:17] <Levin^> I mean the item "Sites Globais"
[13:42:27] <Levin^> taplar: didn't know that one, let me try it
[13:46:27] <Levin^> taplar: well, stopPropagation runs the link of the item "Sites Globais", which is a #, so it goes to top
[13:46:37] <Levin^> still makes it run*
[13:47:32] <taplar> that's really weird cause according to the source, the links are not children of the sites global link
[13:48:36] <Levin^> I mean, they are a list inside another list
[13:48:58] <Levin^> but I had an idea, I'll try to limit the preventDefault to the "first click"
[13:49:00] <taplar> right, but not a child of that other link
[13:49:29] <taplar> <a><ul class="IWouldBeAChild"></ul></a>
[13:49:38] <Levin^> oh
[13:56:13] <taplar> yeah, i think just take that prevent default out
[13:58:09] <Levin^> but what I use instead to nulify the href="#"?
[13:58:28] <taplar> which one?
[13:59:12] <Levin^> when you click "Sites Globais"
[13:59:21] <taplar> ah
[13:59:22] <Levin^> it goes to the top of the page right now
[13:59:42] <taplar> ok, potentially dirty fix.  put an if around the prevent default
[13:59:42] <Levin^> I'm writing an if
[13:59:48] <Levin^> lol yea
[13:59:51] <taplar> only do it if the href === '#'
[14:00:31] <taplar> or you could check the target to see if it is set
[14:01:26] <Levin^> I'll check if it contains a certain class
[14:01:36] <taplar> even better
[14:02:41] <taplar> was this method written by different people?
[14:03:08] <Levin^> yes
[14:03:23] <Levin^> I'm adapting to my environment
[14:03:53] <taplar> i'm just noting the usage of querySelectorAll and forEach in one part, and getElementsByClassName and a for each in another part
[14:04:47] <taplar> and above it there is a ton of jquery, lol
[14:04:53] <Levin^> lol
[14:05:42] <taplar> 693 has a document ready inside a document ready
[14:06:09] <Levin^> 693?
[14:06:17] <taplar> line 693
[14:06:28] <Levin^> my file goes to line 148 lol
[14:06:32] <taplar> code associated with the Menu Sticky
[14:06:38] <taplar> at least that's the comment above it
[14:07:06] <Levin^> oh
[14:12:25] <grapheti> 693?
[14:12:32] <grapheti> 867-5309?
[14:14:30] <Levin^> grapheti: is that your personal number?
[14:14:51] <grapheti> It's Jenny's.
[14:16:33] <Levin^> taplar: if (dropdowns.classList.contains('show')) {
[14:16:44] <Levin^> how do I say "not contains"?
[14:16:51] <taplar> put a ! in front of that
[14:17:04] <grapheti> https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6WTdTwcmxyo/maxresdefault.jpg
[14:17:36] <Levin^> grapheti: lol what
[14:17:45] <taplar> it's a song
[14:17:49] <grapheti> ^
[14:19:35] <Levin^> taplar: err
[14:19:43] <Levin^> where do I put the negation mark
[14:19:56] <taplar> if (boolean expression) {}
[14:19:58] <taplar> right?
[14:20:02] <Levin^> yes
[14:20:14] <taplar> dropdowns.classList.contains('show')  resolves to true/false, right?
[14:20:21] <Levin^> yes
[14:20:27] <taplar> !true === false
[14:20:30] <taplar> !false === true
[14:20:56] <Levin^> ohh, I see what I wrote wrong
[14:31:22] <Levin^> taplar: like this? if (!dropdowns[i].classList.contains('show')) {
[14:31:26] <Levin^> it's not working..
[14:31:46] <taplar> [i]?
[14:32:07] <Levin^> http://34.234.87.242/wp-content/themes/salient-child/js/scripts.js?ver=4.8.4
[14:32:17] <taplar> you need to look at the link that was clicked
[14:33:07] <taplar> no dude, you don't do this in a loop
[14:33:15] <taplar> e.target will be the link that was clicked
[14:33:37] <Neo1> estimate my code https://hastebin.com/sicubosiqi.js
[14:33:59] <Neo1> have I done it in OOP style?
[14:34:03] <Levin^> taplar_meeting: I tried it outside and didn't work as well
[14:34:25] <taplar> if (!e.target.classList.contains('show')) { ... }
[14:34:39] <Levin^> oh
[14:35:07] <Neo1> It's second class I've made
[14:35:47] <Neo1> I've named this style jQuery OOP
[14:36:04] <Neo1> :)
[14:38:28] <robertmaxrees> uh
[14:39:54] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 what makes this "jquery oop"?
[14:40:02] <Neo1> class
[14:40:09] <robertmaxrees> you're just using jquery.
[14:40:09] <Neo1> there exists class
[14:40:48] <Neo1> before I use it like list functions and now in class
[14:40:58] <Neo1> better look
[14:41:04] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make it "jquery oop"
[14:41:07] <robertmaxrees> you're just using jquery.
[14:41:10] <Neo1> easy reuse code
[14:41:30] <robertmaxrees> you're also doing some really inefficient things in here.
[14:41:31] <Neo1> yes, and see I can easier apply this code to other calculators
[14:41:45] <Neo1> what for example?
[14:41:54] <robertmaxrees> $(this.sWeight)
[14:42:02] <robertmaxrees> should store that reference instead of selecting it every time.
[14:42:28] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: you mean selectors?
[14:42:37] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:42:45] <Neo1> see this calculator is created by my class http://prntscr.com/hpqdq5
[14:42:49] <robertmaxrees> i mean store the result of $(this.sWeight) instead of selecting it every time.
[14:44:00] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: how store? I've understood you mean this $('selector') ? explicitly  write it
[14:44:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:44:23] <robertmaxrees> every time you call $(this.sWeight), you're rerunning that selector.
[14:44:30] <robertmaxrees> you should store the result in a propery once.
[14:45:10] <Neo1> you mean this $(this.sWeight).on('change keyup paste', function(event) { ?
[14:45:16] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:45:17] <robertmaxrees> i mean $(this.sWeight)
[14:45:28] <robertmaxrees> this.$weight = $(this.sWeight);
[14:45:29] <robertmaxrees> or whatever
[14:45:35] <robertmaxrees> not sure how that isn't clear.
[14:45:52] <Levin^> uh.. it's still not working
[14:46:20] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 also: you keep using .each() when what you really want is .filter() and then a .map() and .reduce.
[14:46:21] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: that function only calls once
[14:46:37] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 you call $(this.sWeight) multiple times.
[14:46:47] <Neo1> how?
[14:46:53] <robertmaxrees> setTotalGram() {
[14:46:57] <robertmaxrees> and in setTotalPrice.
[14:47:50] <Neo1> yes, and is it wrong?
[14:47:58] <taplar> lots of $(this) in changeWeight too
[14:48:16] <Neo1> I didn't know this
[14:48:32] <robertmaxrees> also: var thisClass=this; //it's reference
[14:48:47] <robertmaxrees> don't do this.
[14:49:15] <robertmaxrees> if you really want to use a class, use a class.  your event handlers should call methods, which in turn call getters and setters on those properties.
[14:49:18] <Neo1> var this Class = this? And how I can access class variables?
[14:49:26] <robertmaxrees> bind your functions.
[14:49:37] <robertmaxrees> or use call
[14:49:47] <Neo1> I don't know what that all means
[14:49:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:49:55] <Neo1> )))
[14:50:02] <robertmaxrees> so OOP is always superior but you don't know how to use it?
[14:50:03] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:50:09] <Neo1> but that class works, I tested it
[14:50:21] <robertmaxrees> i'm not saying it doesn't work.
[14:50:31] <taplar> we're pointing out inefficiencies
[14:50:31] <robertmaxrees> it's just not really very OOP
[14:50:38] <robertmaxrees> ^ and inconsistencies
[14:50:51] <Neo1> How I can remove that $(this) multiple times? It's probably impossible?
[14:50:54] <robertmaxrees> you're basically saying "it's classical OO - i used the class keyword"
[14:50:59] <taplar> var $this = $(this)
[14:51:00] <taplar> done
[14:51:10] <robertmaxrees> *within each method that uses them.
[14:51:18] <robertmaxrees> but you don't really want .each() on those.
[14:51:43] <Neo1> I always use each for choose some elements
[14:52:03] <robertmaxrees> generally it's not really what you want.
[14:52:24] <robertmaxrees> here you're doing a combination of a filter and a reduce.
[14:52:43] <robertmaxrees> and you do that logic a few times.
[14:52:53] <Neo1> I don't know this syntax, I've used it seems once
[14:53:08] <taplar> chance to learn
[14:53:09] <Neo1> yes I all do on each()
[14:53:11] <robertmaxrees> bot setTotalGram and setTotalPrice do almost the exact same thing.
[14:53:21] <robertmaxrees> so abstract that logic out into methods.
[14:53:50] <Neo1> one method?
[14:53:58] <robertmaxrees> multiples imo.
[14:54:02] <Neo1> probably, it's not much important
[14:54:05] <vish93> hey guys I have a gallery and each figure(thumbnail) is wrapped in a div for layout, thus rightly el.childNodes wont suffice, is it possible to get all anchors in a div with say class myGallery?
[14:54:08] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[14:54:15] <Neo1> do you think this will takes much weight? $(this.sWeight)
[14:54:20] <Neo1> in memory?
[14:54:29] <taplar> D.R.Y
[14:54:32] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:54:41] <Neo1> memory can release?
[14:54:42] <robertmaxrees> vidplace7 you want .find()
[14:54:49] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 you're prematurely optimizing.,
[14:54:49] <taplar> why repeat the same logic multiple times?
[14:54:53] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[14:55:02] <robertmaxrees> if you want to do classical OO, then do it.
[14:55:20] <Neo1> and I do classic?
[14:55:23] <robertmaxrees> not yet.
[14:55:45] <robertmaxrees> this is pretty imperative.  you basically stamped what you'd normally do in an IIFE into a class.
[14:55:48] <robertmaxrees> very imperative.
[14:55:49] <Neo1> see if I do that call a few times it won't reload memory as you said?
[14:56:01] <robertmaxrees> why are you so worried about performance right now?
[14:56:05] <Neo1> it will after call free?
[14:56:08] <robertmaxrees> I thought you were concerned with coding style.
[14:56:19] <Neo1> no I don't care about it
[14:56:29] <robertmaxrees> you don't care about coding style?
[14:56:32] <Neo1> yes I want to do in OOP and in right style
[14:56:39] <robertmaxrees> okay
[14:56:42] <Neo1> no, I'm care about it
[14:56:45] <robertmaxrees> then don't worry about perf issues yet.
[14:56:49] <robertmaxrees> this won't hit any.
[14:57:14] <robertmaxrees> Levin^ duder
[14:57:23] <robertmaxrees> your handler is calling preventDefault on all those links.
[14:57:36] <robertmaxrees> you need to check to see if the link is inside that dropdown
[14:57:46] <Levin^> robertmaxrees: I know, I just didn't find a way yet to make it work properly
[14:57:52] <Neo1> I think javascript is not that language where you should care about memory free, there developers have already thought instead you.
[14:57:59] <taplar> no
[14:58:01] <taplar> hell no
[14:58:11] <taplar> you definitely need to be concerned with memory
[14:58:23] <Neo1> I've recalled C++ where always lost memory
[14:58:30] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 this isn't c++
[14:58:32] <taplar> there is a reason we make scopes and namespaces
[14:58:35] <Neo1> taplar: javascript also feed memory?
[14:58:45] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 js manages that for you.
[14:58:52] <taplar> javascript has a GC just like java, which means it will be cleaned up when all references are gone
[14:58:54] <robertmaxrees> keep things straightfoward and you generally won't have an issue.
[14:59:09] <taplar> which means it is to your benefit to destroy references when you don't need things anymore
[14:59:10] <Levin^> robertmaxrees: I'll try again
[14:59:23] <robertmaxrees> i'd be much more worried about dom lookups and handlers.
[14:59:37] <Levin^> I tried to write and if that checks if an element doesn't contain a class
[14:59:41] <robertmaxrees> but premature optimization is a disease.
[14:59:49] <robertmaxrees> Levin^ show me the code in a fiddle?
[14:59:52] <taplar> Levin^: the e.target check didn't work?
[14:59:59] <Levin^> taplar: no
[15:00:42] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I don't understand about this function http://prntscr.com/hpqn48
[15:01:10] <taplar> you wrote that didn't you?
[15:01:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:01:36] <Neo1> why it's wrong? When I call this function I'll get something new that won't free after calling?
[15:01:38] <Neo1> ?
[15:01:47] <Neo1> taplar: I did it
[15:01:51] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 memory is only part of the equation.
[15:02:20] <robertmaxrees> there's also the cost of the DOM lookup.
[15:02:28] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: see when function worked after call all their variables are removed automatically?
[15:02:31] <taplar> and the jQuery object creation
[15:02:36] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 not necessarily.
[15:02:45] <robertmaxrees> the GC doesn't magically run like that.
[15:02:49] <Neo1> no necessary
[15:03:02] <Neo1> it's local variables and they should be removed
[15:03:14] <Neo1> inside function(){ here all local }
[15:03:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:03:23] <robertmaxrees> then why do you want to use a class?
[15:03:42] <robertmaxrees> half of the point is that you have properties on it that persist and describe a thing.
[15:03:54] <Neo1> for better structure of code and reuse it
[15:04:05] <robertmaxrees> this is terrible use of a class.
[15:04:09] <taplar> functions are by nature, reusable
[15:04:13] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:04:50] <robertmaxrees> you're using a class as a storage container for some functions.
[15:05:06] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: no, see I need to create 5 table calculators, this is one for gold, and for silver and other metals I'll do new instance of this class and everything will work, I won't create code again
[15:05:18] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:05:24] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't require a class.
[15:05:35] <robertmaxrees> your class here really is just a container for functions.
[15:06:04] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: see this is selectors http://prntscr.com/hpqq3l
[15:06:13] <Levin^> robertmaxrees: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/mpPjVq?editors=0010
[15:06:28] <robertmaxrees> i understand what those are.
[15:06:34] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I put "#gold span.total-price" and etc
[15:06:40] <robertmaxrees> you're not taking advantage of the class at all.
[15:06:45] <Neo1> for silver #silver
[15:07:10] <Neo1> no, I'll take, I'll repeat use this code multiple times
[15:07:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:07:26] <Neo1> when I did it in function I should recopy all this and it won't useful
[15:07:35] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: How I would do it without class?
[15:07:37] <robertmaxrees> levin uh
[15:07:49] <Neo1> How shall I do it wihtout class? *
[15:07:57] <robertmaxrees> levin that class isn't on any of those links.
[15:08:02] <Neo1> it will more codes than now
[15:08:08] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 not really.
[15:08:13] <Levin^> robertmaxrees: e?
[15:08:14] <Neo1> taplar: do you agree?
[15:08:18] <robertmaxrees> and less code != better.
[15:08:30] <Levin^> or "target?"
[15:08:38] <taplar> i'm not paying much attention right now.  looking at work stuff
[15:08:38] <robertmaxrees> Levin^ e.target.classList.contains('show') - e.target is the link.
[15:08:52] <Levin^> I tried e.dropdowns and didn't work
[15:08:54] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: but 100 row for 5 calculator or more, and 100 * 5  for each calculator?
[15:09:11] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 you can write reusable functions.
[15:09:22] <robertmaxrees> which is really what you've done here.
[15:09:41] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: yes, but classes look more attractive...
[15:09:51] <robertmaxrees> Levin^ you should check if any parents of e.target are .menu-item
[15:09:56] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 not really imo.
[15:10:10] <Neo1> When use functions it seems like you are not much modern. I want to be up to date...
[15:10:32] <taplar> modern isn't important
[15:10:38] <taplar> makes sense is
[15:10:41] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:11:03] <taplar> i don't care if someone comes out with a fancy new socket wrench
[15:11:07] <taplar> i'm going to use a hammer for a nail
[15:11:13] <taplar> it makes sense
[15:11:23] <robertmaxrees> ^&^^
[15:11:32] <Neo1> taplar: but you are always want to be similar new generation, take examples from youth people )))
[15:11:41] <taplar> nope
[15:11:47] <taplar> i want the best solution for the problem
[15:11:54] <taplar> if that solution is 20 years old, so what
[15:11:56] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 you realize the irony in that statement, right?
[15:13:27] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I mean clever youth, not who is stupid, Technology very fast changes and what is now modern and popular tomorrow won't. Of course take example from stupid without experience youth people not worth.
[15:13:36] <robertmaxrees> er
[15:13:42] <robertmaxrees> you realize how old classes are, right?
[15:14:03] <Neo1> yes, very old
[15:14:09] <robertmaxrees> sooo
[15:14:21] <robertmaxrees> also you're basically saying "you should try this new feature because young people are using it" without actually understanding the thing itself.
[15:14:45] <robertmaxrees> you can't evaluate it fully without actually understanding it.
[15:15:45] <Neo1> I just neglect it and think the reason of my slow developing and fails is exactly functional programing. I want change approach. Use something new and to watch how my life is changing...
[15:16:18] <robertmaxrees> how long have you been a developer?
[15:17:08] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: yes, I remember node.js was not popular and now one from up to date technology. Things very fast change in programming
[15:17:15] <robertmaxrees> how long have you been a developer?
[15:17:23] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: 3 years on freelance
[15:17:32] <robertmaxrees> you're still pretty new.
[15:17:48] <robertmaxrees> you have lots to learn.  and since you're freelancing you're not getting much feedback from peers about coding style.
[15:18:15] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I've been working on freelance 2 - 3 years actively, before only read books about programming and did code for myself only
[15:18:38] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[15:18:46] <robertmaxrees> you just have lots to learn. we all do.
[15:19:31] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: no one said me about this one guy who is former C# programming said me write plugin code in classes, and little explained how to do it
[15:19:51] <Levin^> I quit, I'll just remove the href -.-
[15:19:57] <robertmaxrees> Levin^ erm
[15:19:58] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:20:17] <taplar> Levin^: if you console.log(e.target.outerHTML); what does it print?
[15:20:29] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: why? I've very experienced developer, I've been working on freelance more than 2 years and have made many wp plugins have 28 positive reivew on fl.ru and 2 on freelancer.com.
[15:20:45] <taplar> do you work with other developers?
[15:21:05] <Neo1> its want I explicitly did and many orders I did without reviews
[15:21:27] <taplar> do you collaborate on any of your work?
[15:21:28] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 i'm not questioning the quality of your work thus far.
[15:21:38] <Levin^> taplar: <a>Sites Globais</a>
[15:21:45] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 i'm just saying you're still really new to the job.
[15:21:52] <Levin^> (I removed the href already)
[15:21:55] <taplar> that would be for the first click Levin^  what about for the inner one
[15:22:06] <Levin^> I don't know
[15:22:14] <Neo1> taplar: no, only with clients or intermediaries, my projects it's shitty projects, I haven't done something serious yet. :(
[15:22:17] <Neo1> will do
[15:22:30] <taplar> Neo1: how involved are you with developer communities?
[15:22:35] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:22:37] <Levin^> event.target?
[15:22:56] <taplar> Levin^: no, that same console log should trigger if you click the global link or a menu link
[15:23:09] <taplar> you were binding that handler to all of them
[15:23:18] <Levin^> it gave <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/sv/pressmeddelanden/">Suécia</a>
[15:23:31] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: yes, I've realized  it, and I also very slow, Want change today something for changing future tomorrow )
[15:23:33] <taplar> so that guy doesn't have a class
[15:23:38] <taplar> and neither did the global one
[15:23:38] <Levin^> but I don't know how to select only one
[15:23:52] <taplar> which would make your classList.contains logic not make sense
[15:23:58] <Neo1> taplar: in wp, in ubuntu, I've recent learn VPS
[15:24:09] <taplar> Neo1: javascript communities
[15:24:11] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 classes aren't the solution to that problem imo.
[15:24:13] <Neo1> taplar: low involve
[15:24:38] <Neo1> taplar: no I more in wordpress, javascript never learned, only jQuery and using google
[15:24:45] <taplar> So I would propose to you that perhaps your exposure to diverse solutions in javascript is limited, no?
[15:24:56] <robertmaxrees> taplar+++
[15:25:49] <Levin^> taplar: yes
[15:26:00] <Levin^> that's why I asked for help
[15:26:02] <Levin^> :(
[15:26:05] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: don't know, I remember when I was learning C++ I was sitting on this forum http://cyberforum.ru and there was so clever guys, I was impressed how from one guy how nice he know all, and he also very fast develop programs on C++
[15:26:20] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 that comes with experience.
[15:26:28] <Neo1> probably he use classes and OOP I now think about it
[15:26:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:26:47] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 classes aren't the end-all be-all
[15:26:49] <Levin^> taplar: another person just gave me an idea of changing this line to
[15:26:50] <Levin^> Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.menu-dropdown > a')).forEach(function(el) {
[15:26:55] <Levin^> with a >
[15:26:59] <Levin^> it worked :)
[15:27:01] <robertmaxrees> a big part of your struggle seems to be that you aren't very receptive to feedback
[15:27:09] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: no, I think he was so fast because he uses OOP and I not. I think it's my problem that do me slow and not competitive
[15:27:23] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 OOP is just a technique.
[15:27:38] <robertmaxrees> i develop just as quickly with fewer errors in non-oop styles.
[15:28:33] <Levin^> taplar: just now that you said me I understand that the css selector was the responsible to make the script work properly
[15:29:29] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: yes, I tried to do it in javascript and I had recalled instantly how I did apps on C++, classes, education game when I was studied it. It was so easy and in javascript it's do apps in classes more easier than in functions IMHO
[15:29:48] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 "functions" isn't a style of programming.
[15:29:54] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I remember how I did console game on C++ for one night 'reversy in console'
[15:30:06] <robertmaxrees> you're basically saying "doing it with some kind of structure is better than none at all"
[15:30:16] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: imagine for one night all game logic
[15:30:29] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 you're not building a game ;)
[15:30:30] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: easier and better
[15:30:41] <robertmaxrees> and i already said classes have a time and a place./
[15:31:16] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: I'm doing easier thing and slower than game
[15:31:33] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[15:31:39] <taplar> we're back on the friday argument
[15:31:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[15:32:06] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 i really encourage you to hit up ##javascript for more info
[15:32:21] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: have you ever tried to do something in classes? I frankly suggest to try it. and compare feeling with function programming. It's really seem much easier
[15:32:51] <taplar> i've been doing OOP for 10+ years
[15:32:52] <Neo1> robertmaxrees: ok
[15:33:02] <taplar> and i'm telling you, it's not a solution for everything
[15:33:38] <Neo1> taplar: I didn't do it, and will do, say soon you, how my speed faster or not
[15:33:55] <robertmaxrees> Neo1 you're making a lot of assumptions about everybody around you.
[15:35:04] <robertmaxrees> at this point, you'd be much better served by ##javascript.  they can definitely help you.
[15:35:06] <Neo1> taplar: remember we've been speaking about streamline in programming? I'm doing it behalf this. Hope it significantly increase development speed. It's advise I've read on internet there also guy was complain that he is very slow as I am ))
[15:35:47] <taplar> doesn't change anything i've said
[15:36:20] <Neo1> taplar: will see, I'll report you, need time in 3 - 5 months
[15:36:40] <taplar> you don't have to report to me man, heh.  i'm not'cha boss
[15:36:45] <taplar> i'm just conveying my experience
[15:37:23] <Neo1> taplar: I'll just share personal experience with you )
[15:37:55] <Neo1> taplar: ok
[16:55:58] <PGNd> Hi. I'm migrating an 'accordion' to flexbox + some minimal jquery; Here's my current pen: https://codepen.io/pgnd/pen/RxaYqX
[16:55:58] <PGNd> The accordion opens to pane#1 = active.  When you click/toggle to any other pane, the text content transitions in, as defined in my CSS.
[16:55:58] <PGNd> But, currently, on page load, the initial, active pane's text is instantly visible. With lots of text, images & woffs in my production accordion, that pane content is rendered FIRST, and THEN the rest of the accordion draws in around it.
[16:55:59] <PGNd> What I want is the reverse. I.e., to transition IN the initial/active pane's text only AFTER the rest of the accordion construct is loaded.
[16:56:02] <PGNd> I think the answer's in the jQuery document.ready -- but, so far, no luck ... What's the right method on the right selector here?
[17:00:23] <robertmaxrees> wait
[17:00:49] <robertmaxrees> you're complaining about the order it's rendering in?
[17:01:42] <PGNd> robertmaxrees: I'm asking how to delay the rendering of the _content_ of the initial pane
[17:01:49] <robertmaxrees> but why?
[17:02:10] <robertmaxrees> as devs we do everything we can to let things render as fast as possible.
[17:02:24] <robertmaxrees> so it seems unusual that you'd want to delay any part of that.
[17:02:31] <PGNd> As I said abouve "With lots of text, images & woffs in my production accordion, that pane content is rendered FIRST, and THEN the rest of the accordion draws in around it."
[17:02:39] <PGNd>  That is not what I want.
[17:03:27] <robertmaxrees> how slow is the accordion getting drawn in?
[17:03:32] <robertmaxrees> because that codepen seems pretty snappy.
[17:05:12] <PGNd> That codepen is not my production site, obviously.  It's 'light' for discussion.  Whether or not it's snappy (it's not in production) is really not relevant to my question of _how_ to manage the delay.
[17:07:05] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see the production version and watch the network and performace graphs to see what's causing it to load in that order.
[17:07:12] <robertmaxrees> though this is honestly a first for me.
[17:09:41] <PGNd> robertmaxrees: I don't need an analysis.  I'm asking how to delay -- some combination of hide/show perhaps -- that conten.
[17:10:35] <robertmaxrees> that's a really strange thing to want (shrug).  you could render it out with a hidden class or whatever on that content and then remove that on the window load event.
[17:10:56] <robertmaxrees> but be aware that kind of stuff makes your site seem slower than it is and can actually dock you points on google.
[17:12:06] <PGNd> I don't care one whit about google.  As for the "you could ...", right -- that's what I'm asking about.  Specifically, in that pen -- how.
[17:12:21] <robertmaxrees> i just explained the concept.  what part of that wasn't clear?
[17:12:47] <PGNd> The specific application to that pen -- which is why I provided it.  You know, Thanks for your input.  I'll hang out instead for someone that's interested/able in addressing my specific question.
[17:13:04] <robertmaxrees> oh, you want me to edit the fiddle?
[17:13:23] <robertmaxrees> or the codepen, rather
[17:13:56] <taplar> Rudeness doesn't garner desire to help
[17:14:26] <robertmaxrees> ^ also, this channel doesn't really work that way.  we'd rather teach you to fish :) i'd like to help you out if you take a swing at it.
[17:14:38] <robertmaxrees> since the idea is that you learn in the process.
[17:17:15] * robertmaxrees shrugs
[17:17:57] <PGNd> taplar: Rudeness?  Taking into consideration robertmaxrees time & interest, recognizing he's working at something else, and saying "Thanks" is rude?
[17:18:26] <taplar> that is not the entirety of your conversation
[17:18:40] <robertmaxrees> your dismissive attitude and unwillingness to consider some very valid viewpoints is also an issue.
[17:20:23] <PGNd> dismissive attivude?  lmao.  put your big-boy pants on.  not THAT'S dismissive
[17:21:13] <robertmaxrees> he can take a break for a bit :)
[17:21:17] <taplar> yup
