[10:28:22] <nobody1> hi
[10:28:42] <nobody1> sorry for the offtopic but could someone remind me how to register on some channels?
[10:30:10] <nobody1> thanks
[11:24:48] <RingZer0> Is this the channel for jquery mobile as well?
[11:28:08] <RingZer0> Background:  I have a change-quantity.html that I want to be a reusable dialog template _partial.  My issue, when I link to it via <a href="template/_partial/change-quantity.html" ... jquery mobile treats it like a separate page.  The ajax works great, but I need the other page and dialog in the same (nested) scope.  Any thoughts?  (note, I am drawing the <a> tags via a chosen.on(change) event).
[12:02:39] <RingZer0> Let me articulate better.  Page A: I am adding to a jQM list via jquery append.  when I click on the item in the list, it should open a dialog: Page B.  When canceled or closed, my DOM isn't as I left it.
[12:02:44] <RingZer0> meaning, my list is gone.

[14:22:51] <nikio_> how to remove an element using a jquery reference to it?
[14:23:49] <nikio_> so instead of $el.remove(¨#id¨), $el.remove($foo);
[14:31:50] <shoky> $el.remove()
[14:32:06] <shoky> or.. $foo.remove() if that's what you meant
[14:36:47] <nikio_> shoky, yeh i guess thats the way, thanks

[22:28:15] <Byan> hey guys
[22:28:25] <Byan> I am trying to figure out how to use after()
[22:28:27] <Byan> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/bba3999c607f87d9aafe453e0bde8f84
[22:28:52] <Byan> with that it just interests [Object object] or sometrhing
[22:29:12] <Byan> without the $ it inserts the html as raw text (escaped)
[22:29:17] <Byan> I obviously dont understand something :P
