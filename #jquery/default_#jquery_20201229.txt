[12:11:45] <Dalejohn> Hey everyone, first time on here, student at Upenn in Philly everyone has off, including my tutor and im trying to catch up on homework, having a problem cloning an element, now im using forEach and it still creates the element infinitely instead of the index of specified array, can i post my code here and someone let me know what they think?
[15:22:38] <robertmaxrees> Dalejohn don't ask to ask - just share the code snippet in a jsfiddle :)
[15:26:29] <robertmaxrees> Dalejohn also your problem statement is... confusing.
[16:44:14] <Dalejohn> Hi all, so i successfully cloned input blocks from bootstrap, but now when i try to put the time of day on each block from an array it keeps putting 5pm at the first entry and I'm not sure exactly why, any help appreciated.  Thanks  https://jsfiddle.net/dalejohn33/tbmcndLz/1/
[16:45:35] <robertmaxrees> Dalejohn because $('#basic-addon2').text(`${usTime[i]}`); is picking the same element every time.
[16:46:53] <robertmaxrees> the one on the page.
[16:48:03] <robertmaxrees> Dalejohn you have 2 issues to contend with here.  first: when you clone and then append that section, you're creating multiple elements with that same ID, which is invalid.  so you'll need to make that a class instead.
[16:57:46] <robertmaxrees> welp
[16:57:53] <Dalejohn> ok got it, that helps thank you Robert, i changed to classes but now they aren't cloning, i'll keep working
[16:58:10] <robertmaxrees> share your code :)
[16:58:19] <robertmaxrees> i can help you do this lol
[16:58:53] <Dalejohn> var inputgrpclone = $(".input-group input-group-lg");    for (var i = 0; i < usTime.length; i++) {        inputgrpclone.clone().appendTo(".container");        $(".input-group-text").text(`${usTime[i]}`);
[16:58:58] <robertmaxrees> nah in the fiddle.
[16:59:00] <robertmaxrees> update it :)
[16:59:02] <Dalejohn> ok one sec
[16:59:31] <Dalejohn> ok its saved!
[16:59:41] <robertmaxrees> share out the new link :)
[17:00:02] <Dalejohn> https://jsfiddle.net/dalejohn33/tbmcndLz/3/
[17:00:22] <robertmaxrees> so var inputgrpclone = $(".input-group input-group-lg"); isn't selecting what you think it is.
[17:00:45] <robertmaxrees> that's trying to select a <input-group-lg> tag within an element that has the class .input-group.
[17:01:09] <robertmaxrees> can you modify the html?  if so, just add a descriptive class to that section :)
[17:01:16] <robertmaxrees> then select that instead.
[17:02:30] <Dalejohn> awesome one sec thanks so much
[17:03:13] <robertmaxrees> also: your html still has an ID on it.  need to remove if from that span.
[17:08:27] <robertmaxrees> the second issue is around how you're trying to select the newly created element's text.
[17:09:08] <robertmaxrees> errr, *trying to select the newly created element, reather.
[17:14:37] <Dalejohn> I"m having trouble getting rid of that  input group class, im using bootstrap
[17:14:50] <robertmaxrees> nono.
[17:14:54] <robertmaxrees> don't get rid of any classes.
[17:15:01] <robertmaxrees> just add one.
[17:15:12] <Dalejohn> ok
[17:15:25] <robertmaxrees> can do <section class="input-group input-group-lg schedule"> just fine.
[17:17:52] <robertmaxrees> Dalejohn if you get stuck it's fine to say so :)
[17:18:46] <Dalejohn> yeah haha not sure what to do with the new class, just by adding schedule
[17:19:22] <robertmaxrees> you select on that class instead of  $(".input-group input-group-lg");
[17:21:04] <robertmaxrees> so you'll want to start with something like https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yfqrau2o/1/
[17:21:39] <robertmaxrees> (that will still have your original bug but gets rid of the duplicate IDs)
[17:22:55] <robertmaxrees> next, you'll need to change what the for loop is doing.
[17:25:09] <Dalejohn> wow that works, helps a lot thank u, didn't know i could do that
[17:25:18] <robertmaxrees> yep :)
[17:25:53] <robertmaxrees> next up: we're gonna swap out that for loop to make this a bit easier.
[17:26:06] <Dalejohn> so right now its just replacing with '5pm'  i need to change the for loop for that change ok...
[17:26:34] <robertmaxrees> for a variety of reasons, i wouldn't use a for loop, instead instead the forEach method.
[17:26:53] <Dalejohn> ah i did try that and it did the same thing!
[17:26:58] <robertmaxrees> show me :)
[17:30:30] <robertmaxrees> one of the side benefits to a forEach here is that it gets us a new scope, which is helpful.
[17:31:16] <robertmaxrees> (again if you get stuck just lemme know)
[17:31:29] <Dalejohn> ah i don't really have the code handy it was yesterday, but something like
[17:31:30] <Dalejohn> https://jsfiddle.net/dalejohn33/tbmcndLz/5/
[17:32:36] <robertmaxrees> yeah so your issue is $(".schedule-time").text(`${usTime[i]}`);
[17:32:54] <robertmaxrees> that's selecting all schedule-time elements on the page and then .text() is setting the text of the first one.
[17:33:15] <robertmaxrees> you need to use .find() on the cloned one to select the correct one.
[17:34:41] <robertmaxrees> something like https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wvgbon50/3/
[17:41:09] <Dalejohn> wow thats amazing, got it to work, think i understand i'll pore over it
[17:41:19] <robertmaxrees> if you any any questions lmk
[17:41:24] <robertmaxrees> *you have any
[17:42:09] <Dalejohn> appreciate it so much, been bugging me all day!
[17:42:43] <robertmaxrees> get the basic issue tho?  that you needed to .find() it instead of selecting from the whole page?
[17:43:12] <Dalejohn> yeah  this line  newDay.find('.schedule-time').text(time);      is confusing me a bit
[17:43:23] <robertmaxrees> what's confusing about it?
[17:43:28] <Dalejohn> ur adding text from the 'time' function
[17:43:45] <robertmaxrees> time isn't a function there.
[17:43:59] <robertmaxrees> usTime.forEach(function(time) {
[17:44:19] <robertmaxrees> just what we're naming that parameter
[17:46:30] <Dalejohn> oh ok i think i see
[17:47:09] <robertmaxrees> so 'time' refers to whatever array index we're on at that moment.  make sense?
[17:47:50] <Dalejohn> yeah we just happened to call it time
[17:47:54] <robertmaxrees> bingo.
[17:48:06] <robertmaxrees> could call it "foo" or "someOtherName".
[17:48:29] <Dalejohn> thanks so much I have plenty more to do and my class is on break so i have all week ha
[17:48:34] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:48:40] <robertmaxrees> also: that console.log is misleading.
[17:48:44] <Dalejohn> appreciate it!
[17:49:05] <Dalejohn> haha why because it is at the beginning?
[17:49:14] <robertmaxrees> that's when the doc is ready, not jquery.
[17:49:23] <Dalejohn> got it, i will change
[17:50:32] <Dalejohn> I'm taking a break thanks again
[17:50:38] <robertmaxrees> any time :)
[23:16:11] <robertmaxrees> good evening dbz :)
[23:17:25] <dbz> Hi Robert. I'm actually lurking... was getting ready to ask about a shopify modification but I am on the track of sorting it out. I can't believe how SLOW I've becoem
[23:17:44] <robertmaxrees> hah, shopify has a tendency to cause headaches :)
[23:22:45] <dbz> I'm getting one. All my daughter's fault. I got the shippinfd date snippet gping and changed the date formnat to DDD dd MM YYYY. Tht might be ebnough for today!
