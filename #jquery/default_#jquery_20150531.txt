[05:26:39] <hasan> hi. is it a good practice to let users just sign up with their email address. and I send them a password.
[05:26:54] <hasan> so no fiddling around with usernames and setting up a password.
[05:27:23] <hasan> and if they want to change/set something they can do it afterwards any way.
[05:40:13] <Uhkis> i think email as username is very bad for security, people will use their email pass
[05:46:01] <Dev0n> hey, what's the second param in the selector called?
[05:46:18] <Dev0n> $('foo', 'bar')  the 'bar' param
[05:47:20] <Dev0n> foudn it
[05:47:21] <Dev0n> https://api.jquery.com/jquery/
[05:47:23] <Dev0n> context :)
[05:55:02] <KnightsOfNi> Hey, if I want to set a class to all items in this result: $('.icon'); do I need to loop over them or can I add the class to the collection?
[05:57:31] <compact> $('input[type="date"]').onChange() { <-- any idea why nothing will happen?
[06:01:06] <KnightsOfNi> because that is not the syntax compact
[06:01:35] <KnightsOfNi> $('input[type="date"]').on('change', function() {});
[06:26:25] <glowdemon1> Hi
[06:26:47] <glowdemon1> I have a php function isLoggedIn() and I need to check the value in jquery, whats the easiest way to do this?
[06:52:51] <earational> hey
[06:58:39] <Bogdaniel> guys is it posible in jquery to do something like this: 2 lists. select only 1 item from each list and only after that make a link clickable ?
[07:00:57] <decx> elaborate
[07:01:50] <Bogdaniel> decx, i have two lists, and i need to select an element from each list then store it in a php session and then move to another page
[07:02:15] <Bogdaniel> but the last part with storing and moving to another page only after i selected an element from the first list and an element from the second list
[07:02:52] <decx> oh so, select on list1, select on list2 -> interaction done
[07:04:51] <Bogdaniel> yeah
[07:07:07] <decx> so does the user have to confirm this or is it always on the second click
[07:07:16] <Bogdaniel> has to confirm
[07:07:17] <Bogdaniel> :-?
[07:07:41] <decx> do you post that?
[07:08:16] <decx> your php should have a serverside way of saying: "not like this" when it gets incomplete parameters
[07:08:28] <decx> clientside is just for looks in the end
[07:09:12] <OliPicard> Hello! I'm trying to figure out a way of creating a Kendo UI Grid that reads nested Json data.
[07:09:26] <OliPicard> this is my first attempt at trying to bind data in JQ.
[07:12:08] <Bogdaniel> decx, erm passing it to a method in symfony and  store it in a session until i get more data because on a next page i will make another choice and then on the final page i will have a form from where i will have all the data i need
[07:17:23] <Bogdaniel> decx, sorry my internet was down for a second or two .. did u say anything ? :D
[07:17:53] <decx> yes a lot
[07:18:03] <decx> jk is was gone for a moment too
[07:18:08] <decx> i*
[07:18:48] <Bogdaniel> my last message was decx, erm passing it to a method in symfony and  store it in a session until i get more data because on a next page i will make another choice and then on the final page i will have a form from where i will have all the data i need
[07:18:49] <Bogdaniel> :D
[07:19:34] <decx> do you already use some validation for the rest of the form?
[07:20:03] <Bogdaniel> for the rest of the form yes
[07:20:06] <Bogdaniel> i have validation in place
[07:20:16] <decx> why not use that?
[07:20:55] <Bogdaniel> well because if i build the form in symfony and place a radio button set for choices.. it wouldn't work since i need to have a picture show up next to that radio button
[07:20:55] <Bogdaniel> :D
[07:21:12] <Bogdaniel> and all i could think of was to use jquery and do these selects before anything else.
[07:21:13] <Bogdaniel> :D
[07:21:55] <decx> so what do you use jquery-validate?
[07:22:13] <Bogdaniel> for this two lists ?
[07:22:15] <Bogdaniel> yeah i think so
[07:22:40] <decx> you could make a new rule for these
[07:22:47] <decx> so that they require the other one to be set
[07:23:24] <Bogdaniel> yes that's what i have in my mind
[07:23:24] <Bogdaniel> :D
[07:30:48] <decx> oh well
[07:31:03] <decx> just have the first option in your select empty and use the required rule
[07:31:17] <Bogdaniel> already putting something togther :D
[07:31:21] <Bogdaniel> to see how it goes
[07:31:22] <Bogdaniel> :D
[07:31:39] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/uk5s0h7y/
[07:31:40] <andrew_> Is it possible to load a stylesheet dynamically after button press?  something like http://jsfiddle.net/jqjvg93o/4/  Is what I was do, but instead of using the CSS selector, I want to populate an entire style sheet
[07:32:37] <decx> what's giving you trouble about that?
[07:34:35] <andrew_> If you load a new style sheet, don't you have to reload the form, which will cause the entire page to return to default?  Is there away to do this with out causing a form refresh but where all the elements will get rethemed
[07:35:40] <decx> no
[07:35:53] <decx> you can link a stylesheet or a new <style> anytime anywhere
[07:36:40] <andrew_> But If I do that, will the page elements get updated aka if I load a new link sheet when I click button dark, will the box still update?  If so I haven't seen how to do that, I tried $('head').append(<link>...) but that didn't work
[07:37:40] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/jqjvg93o/5/
[07:39:00] <andrew_> Okay cool, still wondering why my attempt didn't work, but that is exactly what i'm looking to do :-)
[08:09:21] <OliPicard> Hello, I've got a question about Kendo Grid UI, I'm attempting to try and get to listed objects inside my remote JSON datastructure. I'm following the Kendo UI tutorials on remote data binding. http://jsfiddle.net/65kWY/678/ Not sure where to go from here, any suggestions are welcome! :)
[08:12:02] <Bogdaniel> how do i remove an element from this array var options = [wood_id, window_id];
[08:36:45] <GeekDude> I'm needing a way to run a service handler on the click of an input button. I've been using `.attr("onClick", "window.location = 'ahk:" + $(e).next().find("a").attr("href") + "'")`, but want to know if it'd be better for me to move to `.click(function(){ window.location = "ahk:" + $(this).next().find("a").attr("href"); })`
[08:37:23] <GeekDude> I'd imagine that there would be some kind of performance hit to creating so many anon functions, so I might want to make it a real function
[08:40:32] <monk3y> GeekDude: others may critique but I'll help until then; I believe the current philosopy is to do $("#inputButtonId").on("click", function() { .. });.  Don't use the onClick attr, and .click was deprecated, I thought.
[08:41:03] <arc_> i am curious as to why that change was made
[08:41:20] <GeekDude> I thought .click was preferred over .on?
[08:41:33] <arc_> from what i have seen in here, no, it's the other way around
[08:41:44] <monk3y> As for anonymous functions .. I don't think the JS engine or heap-memory will die, they seem to be used wildly.  It's better than naming functions and using them for one-offs.
[08:44:22] <monk3y> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9122078/difference-between-onclick-vs-click
[08:45:02] <monk3y> Now that's just an SO opinion, but it's pretty well laid out.  And then there's jQuery's latest; http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:46:55] <GeekDude> oh my
[08:46:58] <GeekDude> "many matching elements would create many identical handlers and thus increase memory footprint"
[08:47:07] <GeekDude> .on does look much better in that regard
[08:47:35] <arc_> i see
[08:48:33] <OliPicard> Hi all, I'm trying to bind remote json data to a kendo grid. I'm seeing lots of examples for simple json structures but i'm unable to find any nested json remote data binding examples. can anyone point me in the right direction towards trying to get Kendo Grid to populate the right nested data. I'm just trying to figure out the right way.
[08:54:25] <GeekDude> This is what my code looks like now, https://gist.github.com/a4df42a353930683f8e9
[08:55:06] <GeekDude> Any further critique would be very appreciated. This is part of a greasemonkey extension I'm writing, so I can't really do it proper. Therefore, jquery bandaid
[08:58:24] <GeekDude> OliPicard: What is a Kendo Grid?
[09:01:06] <OliPicard> GeekDude: http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/web/grid/data-binding It's this :)
[09:02:01] <OliPicard> I'm mainly struggling with nested objects when binding a remote url.
[09:02:51] <GeekDude> I'm not much of a javascript/web dev, though I can get by. However, I'm not quite sure what you mean
[09:03:39] <OliPicard> for example if I want to get the city in this nested json string: https://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select * from weather.forecast where woeid in (select woeid from geo.places(1) where text="London") and u='c'&format=json I'm not able to use the city name which is nested under multiple enumerable objects.
[09:04:33] <OliPicard> the site I was using has also died xD
[09:04:39] <GeekDude> https://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20weather.forecast%20where%20woeid%20in%20(select%20woeid%20from%20geo.places(1)%20where%20text=%22London%22)%20and%20u=%27c%27&format=json
[09:05:47] <GeekDude> query.results.channel.location.city?
[09:05:55] <OliPicard> Yup that's correct
[09:06:03] <GeekDude> I think you'd just need to write a new json filling in the structure with your own data
[09:07:05] <OliPicard> Ah Ok, I might have to make a Python tool to do it on the server side then
[09:07:39] <GeekDude> honestly though, I have no idea what's going on
[09:07:55] <GeekDude> kendoGrid is a jquery plugin?
[09:08:04] <GeekDude> You might ask the Kendo support team
[09:10:41] <OliPicard> ok
[09:46:31] <Poppabear> can someone explain to me why this code doesn't work, the responses are valid via Network Console, but its not changing the DOM? http://pastebin.com/58qA2Qj7
[09:47:14] <Cork> Poppabear: ajax are async
[09:47:28] <Cork> response is set after the return on line 35
[09:47:59] <Whirled> if $(".tb_menu')!=null....   a jquery object shouldn't ever be null, should it?
[09:48:24] <Cork> getTemplate is called | $.get is called | return response is called | line 12-22 execute | line 30 execute
[09:48:55] <Cork> Whirled: as long as $ is jquery
[09:49:14] <Cork> that statement is needed for ex prototype
[09:49:24] <Whirled> got it. brilliant
[09:49:59] <Cork> Whirled: also if $()!=null isn't valid js
[09:50:44] <Whirled> that was in poppabear's post, btw. line 13...that 's why I asked.
[09:51:12] <Cork> Whirled: no you ripped out the wrapping ()
[09:51:17] <Poppabear> :P
[09:51:31] <Cork> but ya those if cases isn't needed
[09:51:52] <Cork> Poppabear: what you need to do is return the xhr object $.get returns
[09:52:07] <Cork> Poppabear: and then use getTemplate().done(function(response) {}); instead
[09:52:21] <Cork> and response is accessable inside the callback
[09:52:26] <Cork> you can't "leak" it
[09:52:59] <Whirled> Perhaps you have a suggestion how to proces this horrible html document into a usable array of objects: http://whirledorder.com/temp/inventory.htm
[09:53:07] <Poppabear> Cork: yea, i was trying to keep the code cleaner :P
[09:53:24] <Cork> Poppabear: also note that if you're doing cors you can't fetch html unless the server sets cors headers
[09:53:47] <Cork> Poppabear: the solution i gave you would still do that
[09:54:34] <Cork> Poppabear: another problem is that you don't know if header or footer will come first
[09:54:49] <Cork> (that depends on network latency)
[09:55:16] <Poppabear> yea i know, i am currently working on with a 3rd party to fix there cross domain issues, my case is very different then most others, the files are local, but are access thru a different domain. i do not have access to the 3rd parties source that i am creating the plugin for ... 3rd party is "Enjin.com" btw
[09:55:50] <Cork> Poppabear: the best option is to use $.when
[09:56:02] <Cork> as you need to wait for all the responses
[09:56:14] <Poppabear> hmm
[09:56:22] <Poppabear> ok
[09:56:49] <Poppabear> i'll have to lookup the docs for that, still fairly new to jquery
[09:57:27] <Cork> Poppabear: you need to read up on async ajax calls too
[09:58:06] <Cork> Poppabear: also $('.tb_menu') != null needs to be changed to $('.tb_menu').length > 0
[09:58:14] <Cork> (same with the other != null)
[09:58:20] <Poppabear> yea i need to a lot of reading really, but i learn best by creating errors, researching, then learning why :P
[09:58:22] <Poppabear> oh ok
[09:58:23] <Poppabear> thanks
[09:58:27] <Poppabear> taking notes ... ha
[09:58:47] <Cork> Poppabear: jquery ALWAYS returns a value to null/undefined won't ever be true
[10:00:06] <Poppabear> ok
[10:01:51] <Whirled> Cork, any brilliant ideas on how to parse the data out of the form I linked?
[10:01:58] <glowdemon1> Hi, I have a php function isLoggedIn(), how do I check the returning value of it in jquery?
[10:02:18] <OliPicard> Ok i'm trying to get a kendo grid to bind some remote json data. I have put the objects into the correct schema but i'm struggle to get a result back apart from a blank grid. Any ideas how I can sort the nested json out? - http://jsfiddle.net/65kWY/10/light/
[10:02:44] <Cork> Poppabear: try something like this https://jsfiddle.net/4naznrzu/
[10:03:44] <Cork> Whirled: yay.. from a pdf
[10:04:21] <Cork> Whirled: the only solution i know of is to render the content and grab the text from that
[10:04:25] <Whirled> Not sure...it was printed to an html doc...the only way to export any data out of this ancient program
[10:04:41] <Cork> Whirled: no, that wasn't a question :)
[10:04:47] <Cork> i recognice the patter ^^'
[10:05:20] <OliPicard> Cork: It's weird this schema, it's something i've used many times in Python without issues.
[10:06:08] <Cork> glowdemon1: php runs server side, you can't access its code at all
[10:06:32] <Cork> glowdemon1: you have to expose the result at a resource you can call from ajax
[10:06:44] <Cork> glowdemon1: or store it before hand in the page as it gets rendered
[10:17:27] <ashgotti> Hello everyone. I need a bit of help with a bit of custom validation. http://jsfiddle.net/6qwkyapr/ This field needs 9 digits. It works if the user only enters digits. The common structure though is with dashes like 999-888-777 so I'd like it to work for both cases. I'm stripping out the dashes but it doesn't seem to work.
[10:18:10] <Poppabear> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/mddcz9v6/ , menu and frmCreateTeam isn't loading anything, and i get a couple "success" output to the DOM ?
[10:20:05] <Cork> Poppabear: the variables in the function is an array of the values $.ajax would have given to .done
[10:20:23] <Cork> Poppabear: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/#example-0
[10:21:28] <glowdemon1> http://paste.ofcode.org/LfPXyPEbSupfdyTiQBCE7S Can someone explain me how I can achieve this?
[10:23:03] <Cork> groenroos: you have to echo the value of isLoggedIn($dbcon) into the page
[10:23:17] <Cork> glowdemon1: either into a js variable or into a dom attribute
[10:23:48] <Cork> glowdemon1: js can't access the php state (as the network is inbetween
[10:24:00] <glowdemon1> alright, thanks
[10:27:46] <OliPicard> i'm starting to think nested json grids are impossible :(
[10:28:01] <OliPicard> I've even tried updating the schema
[10:30:04] <OliPicard> Here's what i've tried doing: https://jsfiddle.net/65kWY/10/
[10:34:41] <Poppabear> Cork: why would frmCreateTeam and menu return null ? thats my issue atm ....
[10:35:06] <Cork> Poppabear: cause it is null if the element doesn't exist
[10:35:15] <Cork> (check in the .when call)
[10:35:33] <Cork> (.....length > 0 ? : )
[10:37:43] <Poppabear> right i understand that, but this is the thing, menu and content element is in the header.htmlso i have to wait for header and footer, then load menu and frmCreateTeam .... so 2 $.when() 's ?
[10:40:04] <Cork> Poppabear: wait, so the checker is meant to check in the responses?
[10:41:03] <Cork> cause ya, that would mean there would have to be an extra layer (the header would have to get back before you know if you need the rest or not)
[10:41:25] <Poppabear> right ...
[10:41:34] <Poppabear> is that an ok way of doing it ?
[10:41:38] <Cork> if all this is local, it might be cleaner to just always fetch it all
[10:41:52] <Cork> and have the selector handle if the element doesn't exist
[10:42:15] <Cork> Poppabear: the entire structure is quite iffy
[10:42:24] <Poppabear> but i can't fetch it do to cross domain errors, this is something i am working with the 3rd party to fix
[10:42:36] <Cork> Poppabear: a much better structure is to have the server send the data in one request instead
[10:43:06] <Cork> either have it merge the partials into on big request
[10:43:13] <Cork> or have the partials sent as ex. a json response
[10:43:22] <Cork> where each section is in there
[10:43:30] <Poppabear> hmm
[10:43:50] <Poppabear> json may be a solution
[10:44:25] <Cork> Poppabear: if you need to handle cors jsonp might be a simple solution
[10:44:32] <Cork> two birds and all that :)
[10:45:07] <Poppabear> can't use jsonp, i do not have access to the other side to handle the callback
[10:46:12] <Cork> Poppabear: but they provide json?
[10:47:41] <Poppabear> its so hard to explain and will only make your head hurt, a lot of the issues is with the way the 3rd party is structured and how i am trying to implement a plugin system with out there support for a plugin system :P
[10:51:31] <Poppabear> they have a place to upload files, and you can access those files using a subdomain of theirs (which is different then the requesting domain), only images, js, and html files are allowed (no PHP) ... and they are hosting the site, the site is a modular site, you can add premade modules to your site, one of the modules is an html module. this is where i am linking the main .js file for my plugin.
[10:52:26] <Poppabear> then i can control the content of the html module and be able to implement applications with the use of PHP and MySQL ....
[10:52:34] <Poppabear> its so hard to explain ...
[10:52:36] <Poppabear> lol
[11:24:23] <dan_s> IDK if it is the CSS or jQuery but I have a wierd problem: if I scroll the page very fast, sometimes I can go outside of the page (chrome):  http://i.imgur.com/Lfs9vJV.png The elements are in the correct position but the rendering is wrong (the navbar is fixed to the top also when scrolling the page)
[11:24:59] <dan_s> I´m going crazy... It makes no sense
[11:34:46] <ashgotti> I need a bit of help with a bit of custom validation. http://jsfiddle.net/6qwkyapr/ This field needs 9 digits. It works if the user only enters digits. The common structure though is with dashes like 999-888-777 so I'd like it to work for both cases. I'm stripping out the dashes but it doesn't seem to work. I console log and it does show that it's counting 9 digits though.
[11:41:26] <shoky> ashgotti: you probably want >= instead of == in line 21
[11:41:49] <ashgotti> shoky: The value should only be 9 digits though
[11:41:54] <ashgotti> min 9 and max 9
[11:42:28] <shoky> ashgotti: 999-888-777 is 11 characters
[11:42:54] <ashgotti> shoky: Understood but I'm stripping out the dashes. I console.log the 'sin' var with the dashes and it equals 9 with dashes.
[11:43:07] <shoky> ashgotti; you're stripping them from the "sin" var, not from the input's value
[11:44:13] <ashgotti> shoky: oh! that's where the issue is.

[14:09:47] <ilhami> hey
[14:10:00] <ilhami> anyone who knows of a nice drag and drop widget plugin?
[14:10:43] <Talow_> jquery ui has drag and drop. As well as sortable.
[14:11:15] <ilhami> no better plugins than jQuery UI?
[14:11:36] <Talow_> oh I'm new to this stuff, I just happened to use it recently.
[14:12:11] <ilhami> oh.
[14:12:40] <Talow_> The sortable wasn't too hard to use. Link it with the stop and you can run whatever when the user stops sorting.
[15:03:32] <tasaif-guest> is robert going to be showing up today some time?
[15:14:05] <ilhami> tasaif, dunno.
[16:39:17] <printForever> can jQuery break loading of a CSS?
[16:39:38] <printForever> like, stop browser from parsing out the content
[16:40:35] <printForever> maybe if the part of the page is generated by JavaScript and then you apply jQuery to that part of the page
[16:40:37] <printForever> ...
[16:51:24] <ilhami> why do you ask?
[16:51:32] <printForever> having some issues
[16:51:39] <printForever> but I just found out it was a caching thing

[17:53:31] <Talow> background:transparent;
[17:53:55] <Talow> but altering the image no
[17:54:18] <Talow> would be easier to redo the sprite in .gif or .png with it already transparent.

Hopefully my explanation makes sense.  Can someone help me figure out the javascript to write?
[20:14:51] <tash> but only on keyup or on change or something. By default, qty is 0.  when the page loads I don't want all of the reference cells to be red just b/c the qty is 0.
[20:18:02] <arc_> if you haven't written any of the jquery yourself, you'll have to give more information than that
[20:18:05] <arc_> how are the quantities being set
[20:18:39] <arc_> what is supposed to be in the field labeled reference
[20:19:09] <arc_> what is the actual use of this, i guess is the question
[20:19:25] <tash> yeah, let me explain, sorry. that was the world's worst freakin' question
[20:19:52] <Talow> no, you asked it so it can't be.
[20:20:01] <Talow> ;)
[20:21:13] <tash> The quantities are being populated from a mysql query.  Initially they are all 0 b/c it uses a template.  The user can change quantities and save the template.  They can type something in the reference field like "foo" and save it as well.  The thing is, if someone types something in the reference field and there is no quantity, we want the reference field to be highlighted just for that row.  This might help...
[20:21:27] <tash> if referenceXX is not empty, but qtyXX is, then highlight referenceXX red.
[20:21:33] <tash> if reference XX is not empty, and qtyXX is 0, then highlight reference XX red.
[20:21:46] <tash> where XX is the same number for qty and reference in the same row
[20:22:19] <Talow> do you want that to happen on submit?
[20:22:36] <tash> no, not on submit, on keyup I think
[20:22:52] <tash> don't want them to submit the form with a 0 qty that has a reference
[20:23:27] <Talow> Oh so just color the field if invalid...
[20:23:32] <tash> keyup or change, not sure which to be honest, been a long long time since I did any of this and I was never really that great at it
[20:23:36] <tash> right Talow
[20:27:04] <tash> Talow: I wrote something earlier, wasn't jquery, that did the right thing but only seemed to work for the first row in the table.  I'd prefer to go with jquery if possible
[20:31:12] <tash> guess my fiddle is actually written wrong
[20:31:24] <Talow> Yeah You'll want to start by fixing your html
[20:31:44] <Talow> I'd also suggest removing the onkeyup stuff for now and put that directly into the JS
[20:33:15] <tash> I think I've at least got the html in a better state in the fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/1nrasxup/2/
[20:34:50] <tash> basically the fiddle is a 2X2 table.  If row 1's Reference has anything it in, but row 1's Qty is 0 or empty, highlight row 1's Reference.
[20:35:29] <arc_> tash https://jsfiddle.net/1nrasxup/3/
[20:35:49] <arc_> i trust you can figure out the rest of it, but if you can't, i'll help
[20:36:21] <tash> I imagine I can, one sec, looking at it.
[20:36:33] <Talow> Forgetting the closing td </td>
[20:36:45] <arc_> i didn't fix the html :p
[20:36:52] <Talow> wasn't meaning you arc ;)
[20:37:11] <Talow> also that's almost the same thing i was typing.
[20:37:18] <Talow> I've learned alot from rob :D
[20:37:53] <tash> just digesting this, this is very helpful. I think I'll learn a lot from this exercise and hopefully be able to take it with me on other tasks without the need of asking for help
[20:38:14] <arc_> me too. i came here just to get help with one thing but figured i may as well stick around and help other people with basic stuff and learn from other people's more complex problems
[20:38:39] <Talow> why I'm still here too arc :D
[20:40:20] <tash> glad to hear that guys, makes perfect sense, instead of stickin' it to the newbs like me. Much appreciated
[20:44:36] <tash> well, I took it one step further, closer to my goal https://jsfiddle.net/1nrasxup/4/
[20:45:05] <tash> so, if qty is empty or 0, and there is text in the reference cell ... do stuff
[20:45:21] <arc_> i was going to add another if statement instead of using || but i guess that works too
[20:45:24] <arc_> just a bit harder to read
[20:45:31] <tash> yeah, I didn't know what was best
[20:45:40] <tash> I guess I could easily convert it.
[20:45:46] <arc_> honestly i don't know either
[20:45:48] <arc_> ;)
[20:46:13] <Talow> Personally when I start my if they go in seperat things...
[20:46:21] <Talow> so I can define what's going where
[20:46:24] <arc_> so now you just need to remove the red class when the input becomes valid
[20:46:27] <Talow> the I group as needed.
[20:46:43] <tash> Now I just need to figure out: If qty was 0 or empty and we typed in the reference cell ( which turned it red ) ... remove red when I change qty from 0/empty to a real value like 1,2,3 whatever
[20:46:45] <Talow> else is an awesome keyword
[20:46:55] <tash> gotta tuck the kids in first, brb
[20:47:23] <arc_> i'm not sure what happens if you try to remove a class that doesn't exist. i guess it probably just doesn't do anything
[20:47:46] <Talow> I wouldn't expect it to.
[20:48:25] <arc_> yeah just adding an else statement works fine
[20:49:44] <Talow> else removeClass
[20:50:40] <Talow> but yeah this will get hard to read...
[20:50:50] <Talow> once it don't need to be read by people on line ifs are okay
[20:51:29] <Talow> in C# i know they are better preformance, no idea with JS since it's browser's instead of processor :S
[21:20:02] <arc_> tash i actually kind of steered you wrong a bit on this
[21:20:05] <Talow> so arc, one issue with your example was that the function never found the correct input, because the parent was the td, not the tr.
[21:20:09] <Talow> https://jsfiddle.net/1nrasxup/5/
[21:20:19] <arc_> https://jsfiddle.net/1nrasxup/6/
[21:20:37] <arc_> lol...
[21:20:41] <Talow> lmao
[21:20:55] <Talow> very nice
[21:21:07] <tash> back
[21:21:22] <tash> so should I look at 5 or 6 lol
[21:21:31] <Talow> 5 has an extra check
[21:21:36] <arc_> either one
[21:21:44] <Talow> but they both fix the issue you where about to run into
[21:22:03] <arc_> funny how similar our code ended up being
[21:22:38] <tash> very nice!
[21:23:01] <tash> now I'm going to actually digest the code to make sure I understand it instead of just move along
[21:23:02] <Talow> yeah it was very much the same
[21:23:51] <tash> makes perfect sense
[21:23:54] <Talow> First thing was instead of parent, which return the td instead of the tr, we changed to closest, and looked for the tr.
[21:24:08] <Talow> after that we get the correct input
[21:24:15] <tash> pretty sure I never would have figured that out on my own
[21:24:21] <tash> not enough experience
[21:24:31] <Talow> oh then plz...
[21:24:37] <Talow> what browser you useing?
[21:24:49] <tash> FF at the moment
[21:24:57] <tash> I have firebug
[21:25:02] <Talow> console.log
[21:25:12] <Talow> but I don't know how to open the console in FF
[21:25:21] <arc_> probably basically the same
[21:25:28] <Talow> in opera and chrome I know you can get it from ctrl + shift + i
[21:25:46] <tash> Firebug, nice add on for FF
[21:25:49] <arc_> when you open the inspector, whatever it's called in firefox, there's a tab called console
[21:25:49] <tash> there is a console tab
[21:25:55] <tash> yeah, that
[21:26:18] <Talow> you can then use console.log($(this));
[21:26:25] <arc_> outputting to console.log helps you understand what is happening when you select things
[21:26:26] <Talow> or whatever it is you want to know.
[21:26:38] <tash> perfect
[21:27:17] <tash> now, rather than give the input a border, how to actually make the input itself red? like a background color to make it even more noticeable
[21:27:29] <Talow> #5 however checks the quantity to be sure it's numberic and also have to be > 1 or it's red.
[21:27:40] <tash> Talow, yeah noticed that, perfect
[21:27:49] <Talow> background:#red
[21:27:53] <Talow> err
[21:27:55] <Talow> red*
[21:28:12] <Talow> that's just css styling
[21:28:21] <tash> ah, yeah
[21:28:22] <tash> cool
[21:28:23] <tash> thanks
[21:28:53] <tash> now to go test this in the app and not fiddle, will be around...thanks guys
[21:28:56] <Talow> >1 should be > than 0 or it's red hehe
[21:30:17] <Talow> just so you know this gets triggered off of any element the user changes with the class of textfield (that's what the .textfield near the start is for :D)
[21:33:04] <tash> yeah, guess I better make sure that doesn't cascade into anything it shouldn't lol
[21:34:23] <tash> and I just put that js inside <script type="text/javascript"> </script> right?
[21:35:03] <Talow> or into a js file and include it
[21:36:01] <Talow> personally I'd do the js file, makes edits easier.
[21:38:46] <tash> oh, hmm.  So I can literally name a js file, with that js in there, and then just put a <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/file.js"></scipt> in <head> ?
[21:40:05] <Talow> <script type="text/javascript" src="myFile.js" />
[21:40:17] <Talow> no need to do that </script> there just end it
[21:40:37] <arc_> is the $(document).ready part necessary, or do i just always put that because i have always done
[21:40:58] <Talow> I think that works.. but a while since I typed it myself
[21:41:08] <arc_> hm
[21:41:23] <tash> but inside <head> yes?
[21:41:46] <arc_> not necessarily. a lot of sites put js at the footer, for reasons i can't currently remember
[21:42:46] <Talow> Oh right... now I remember you can use the self closing tags with xhtml or xml doc types... if it's just an html doc type then you'll need to close it like you did before.
[21:45:12] <Talow> The js typically is in the header, there are some places this changes but for me, I typically have it in the head, it's the best place for the type of thing it's doing.
[21:47:57] <tash> how do I know if jquery is getting loaded properly?  I plugged this code into the app I'm testing via FF and the stuff that was working in fiddle isn't working here
[21:49:21] <arc_> can you link it
[21:49:35] <tash> even the console isn't showing anything
[21:49:54] <tash> I put these in <head>
[21:49:55] <tash> <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
[21:49:55] <tash> <script type="text/javascript" src="../custom_jquery.js"></script>
[21:50:33] <tash> they show up in page source
[21:51:08] <arc_> without being able to actually see it i really can't say what might be happening
[21:52:49] <Talow> did you put the class = textfield on the text fields?
[21:53:02] <Talow> without that there's nothing to trigger the JS
[21:55:08] <tash> yeah, I did
[21:55:31] <Talow> lets see
[21:57:38] <tash> how can I show you?  I'm looking at the first <td> on the page ( which is qty ). I'm inspecting element.  <input class="textfield qty" type="text" value="0" name="_qty45"></input>
[21:58:23] <Talow> we would need to see the code to know what's going on so a working version if you have a way to show us would be easiest.
[21:59:10] <tash> hmm, bummer. Have to login to this site to see.  Too bad I can't screen share
[21:59:36] <ravenzz> try to reproduce your issue on a pastebin then
[22:01:27] <Talow> I guess insureing that the custom_jquery.js is a valid path wouldn't hurt either.
[22:09:30] <boodllebat> i'm making a cross domain POST (ajax) request and every time i get "blank response"
[22:10:58] <zmaakc> I'm looking for some insight on why qUnit thinks I've miscounted assertions, unless assert.expect() counts as an assertion?
[22:11:09] <zmaakc> Example of test failing due to expecting one assert but receiving two: http://jsbin.com/dazusodumu/1/edit?js
[22:11:33] <ravenzz> ?cors @ boodllebat
[22:11:46] <ravenzz> no bawt?
[22:11:49] <boodllebat> ravenzz: what is cors ?
[22:12:27] <ravenzz> boodllebat: cross-origin resources sharing
[22:12:43] <arc_> ravenzz i know it's unlikely but did you used to play wow on shadowsong
[22:13:18] <ravenzz> arc_: oh no I am not into games :D
[22:13:23] <arc_> okay lol
[22:13:31] <arc_> there was somebody in my guild named ravenzz
[22:13:45] <Talow> A friend of mine named her daughter raven.
[22:13:54] <Talow> however I dought that it has anything to do with this
[22:14:02] <ravenzz> but I guess I've been on IRC for ages and hung out with a lot of nerds
[22:14:08] <ravenzz> oh ok
[22:14:40] <ravenzz> weird people always make the ravensburger joke
[22:15:39] <arc_> i'm not familiar
[22:53:51] <boodllebat> ravenzz: i' did CORS header on my PHP side now i'm getting response i can see it in my HTTP inspector but i'm unable to process it inside jquery success i did alert(data); but nothing happens
[23:38:23] <boodllebat> i want something like this  ----> event trigges when users scrolls and reach upto a certain DIV
[23:55:30] <arup_r> getting error from https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/577d7cedb0f8e97b4b2f Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token !
[23:55:38] <arup_r> how to do not logic
