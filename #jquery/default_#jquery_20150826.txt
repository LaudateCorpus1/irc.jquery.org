[00:29:06] <serengeor> Can I update values I get from server request for this plugin somehow? https://select2.github.io/examples.html
[00:46:32] <Cork> serengeor: check the "Loading remote data" section
[00:48:19] <serengeor> Cork, Yeah. I've seen it. But that's not the way I need to load data. I get the data back once user is done editing some other fields. After that the data doesn't change.
[00:48:55] <Cork> serengeor: are you converting a normal <select> element, is that what you mean?
[00:51:13] <serengeor> Cork, yes. But I might need to update it after user changes other fields in future.
[00:52:01] <serengeor> for example user changes date in datepicker and options need to be reloaded from server.
[00:52:36] <serengeor> I'd gladly use normal select, but I need that "pretty" formating :/
[00:54:45] <serengeor> Cork, any ideas if that's possible?
[00:55:03] <Uhkis> you'd bind change on the datepicker and do the remote data fetching there
[00:56:09] <serengeor> Uhkis, data fetching is not the problem. I already have the data fetching part done.
[00:56:32] <serengeor> The problem is updating this select2 with values
[00:59:19] <serengeor> I've seen issues created for this specific problem
[01:02:13] <keglevich> I have a jquery vertical dropdown (accordion) menu at my wordpress site which would need a small modification... if here's someone who would be willing to check it out, I'd highly appreciate it!
[01:03:47] <Uhkis> serengeor: sec, ill check how i did it
[01:05:34] <Uhkis> serengeor: .trigger("chosen:updated");
[01:06:13] <serengeor> Uhkis, and how do you load in the new options?
[01:06:49] <Uhkis> serengeor: just update the select options normally
[01:25:12] <Katharsis> did you know / can recommend me alternative for http://james.padolsey.com/demos/grayscale/?
[01:25:50] <Katharsis> i mean, the lib / script which return me hole greyscale page (colors + images) but will be newer and faster?
[01:36:37] <kirua> when i do an append, is it same as writing the html ? becuase when i look at the source code with firefox , i dont see the html
[01:36:49] <Cork> Katharsis: why not just use css filter?
[01:37:17] <Cork> kirua: if you right click the page and selecting view source code you only see the original page
[01:37:32] <Cork> use the inspector or ctrl+a => view selected source code
[01:38:40] <kirua> aha ok
[01:38:42] <kirua> thanks!
[01:43:16] <anotheryou_> I got 2-3 problems and need general advice on how to even begin tackling them: 1. I got some ajax that dumps html (some divs), I somehow need to store these because I do not want to display all of them. 2. I need to detect how many divs I can fit in my parent div and put those in. Havent found a reliable off-screen detection, probably need to build my own. 3. need to remove the displayed divs on demand to show the ajax divs that
[01:43:17] <anotheryou_> did not fit.
[01:44:09] <anotheryou_> I might be able to detect the out of bounds thing myself (2), but I'm unsure on how to store the incoming html
[01:44:38] <Uhkis> just dump it to some global var
[01:44:58] <anotheryou_> in some array i suppose?
[01:45:46] <Uhkis> i'd use $(data) but it's up to you
[01:46:38] <anotheryou_> I need to keep track of everything. that's easier with an array I guess (track which divs are currently displayed, which are preloaded on page 2 and which have been discarded)
[01:47:48] <anotheryou_> thanks
[02:24:01] <Lenry> Hey guys, quick question. using jquery ajax when are done/fail/always fired ? done when transaction is success, fail when error but when is always fired ? Because in my code it seems like always fires before the transaction is made. Maybe i have another problem in my code. But im curious
[02:31:01] <Cork> Lenry: as the name states it is always fired
[02:31:14] <Cork> as soon as an ajax call is ended one way or another
[02:31:57] <Cork> so basically .done(always).fail(always) == .always(always)
[02:32:06] <Cork> except the arguments differ
[02:32:38] <Lenry> Cork, okay like i thought. I guess there is antoher problem in my code then. Thanks :)
[03:00:42] <mikecmpbll> i'm having a problem trying to figure out how to get this little tooltip tour behaving as I'd like http://jsfiddle.net/mikecmpbll/amdu8zLa/ - the problem, as you can see is that i collapse the panel in the teardown of one step, which shifts the position of the target of the next step such that the tooltip is in completely the wrong place
[03:01:47] <anotheryou_> is there an easy wad to make divs "overflow" into a second container?
[03:01:49] <anotheryou_> way
[03:13:07] <shibly> How can i parse this and get value? Object { 0: "5", 1: "shibly2", id: "5", non_friend: "shibly2" }
[03:13:53] <shibly> I tried this: https://bpaste.net/show/b517a0be6fca
[03:14:12] <shibly> output: Object { 0: "5", 1:  "shibly2", id: "5", non_friend: "shibly2" }
[04:02:24] <km4> $.ajax( $.getJSON() ) its correct ? or if use $ajax then dont use $.getJSON inside
[04:04:19] <shoky_> km4: it's not correct, don't use both.  $.getJSON is just a shortcut for  $.ajax({type: 'json'...})
[04:08:01] <km4> shoky_: ok
[04:10:55] <rindolf> Hi all. Sup?
[04:15:00] <xenaxon> hi. how can I compare 2 strings and wrap characters that don't match with a span?
[04:17:01] <xenaxon> can someone help me?
[04:19:56] <xenaxon> hi. how can I compare 2 strings and wrap characters that don't match with a span?
[04:42:01] <Cork> xenaxon: there isn't anything ready made for that
[04:42:06] <Cork> at least not that i know of
[04:42:51] <Cork> depending on how intelegent you want the finder to be it can be quite tricky to write it (how much should it depetct partial differences)
[04:43:45] <isthisreallife> hi
[04:44:11] <isthisreallife> http://pastie.org/10376778  whats wrong with this code, it doesnt change height
[04:45:12] <Cork> isthisreallife: please use jsfiddle or jsbin instead
[04:45:27] <Cork> (or any of the live code sites)
[04:55:58] <EvilRick> hey guys.. I'm kind anew to jquery and am using the easyui framework for some dev. I am having trouble programatically calling the combobox onChange event handler from javascript. I have no idea how I should deb calling it. The event fires fine and does the work when I use the mouse to change the combobox. but I want to use javascript to fire that event directly when I need to.
[04:56:02] <EvilRick> any suggestions?
[04:56:45] <EvilRick> sorry,, thats onSelect not onChange
[04:57:38] <Cork> EvilRick: onSelect isn't a standard event
[04:57:50] <Cork> actually doesn't sound like an event at all
[04:58:00] <Cork> so you might not be able to programatically call it
[04:58:07] <Cork> depends on the plugin
[04:58:07] <EvilRick> yes.. its extended by easyui
[04:59:56] <anotheryou__> how would I undo an .append()? I want to check if it fits on screen and if it overflows it should be removed. or should I just check for the overflow and than hide the last child?
[05:00:11] <taplar> find the child and remove() it
[05:00:15] <EvilRick> so no its not a jQuery event.
[05:00:29] <anotheryou__> taplar, ah, right. last-child still works
[05:00:53] <taplar> or if you still have the reference to the element you appended you don't even have to find it
[05:08:15] <anotheryou__> taplar, will have, for now I don't :) I'm not in charge for the server side...
[05:09:20] <taplar> huh?  no i was meaning like
[05:09:49] <taplar> var $newelement = blah;  $parent.append($newelement); if (itsTooBig) { $newelment.remove(); }
[05:14:40] <Cork> anotheryou__: just append the elements and then in a loop check that scrollHeight == 0
[05:15:01] <Cork> hmm sorry
[05:15:08] <Cork> scrollHeight == height()
[05:19:44] <anotheryou__> than i need to remove "overflow: hidden" i the css?
[05:19:49] <anotheryou__> Cork?
[05:20:03] <Cork> no
[05:20:10] <anotheryou__> hm ok
[05:20:20] <Cork> scrollHeight is the height of the parent element _including_ the scroll area
[05:20:35] <Cork> that is why you want to compare it to the element height to see if it overflows
[05:20:58] <Cork> hmm height of the element, not parent element :x
[05:41:11] <smgs> https://jsfiddle.net/rq79cbf3/ in this javascript code there is always supposed to be a .click() event/line followed by the actual line in which i put values into input box. i cannot work on the last scriptlet that is pressing the submit button ( as it is also supposed to be followed by .click() event ) and also counting the characters in the captcha input box. ( as it again is supposed to be followed by .click() , as all the previous lines are. THANKS
[05:53:54] <codytr> Hi everyone
[05:53:56] <codytr> How does this should look like $(function(){   $('#Container').mixItUp({     load: {       filter: '.category-1'     },     controls: {       toggleFilterButtons: true     }   }); });
[05:54:14] <codytr> if I want it to load all insted of only category-1

[06:03:58] <RabSimpson> hi folks. i'm working with bxslider and trying to emulate the effect found on http://gleneagles.com/. i'm trying to get the first slide to appear in the centre of the viewport, but not having much luck. my url is slightly nsfw, just so you're aware. any ideas?: http://www.14lsq.co.uk/static/
[06:06:38] <anotheryou__> if i append html stuff, how long do I have to wait before measuring stuff? I fill a div and need to know the new hight after the append() and it seems to be delayed
[06:07:53] <anotheryou__> or how to wait just long enough for the dom to have updated?
[06:11:30] <DarsVaeda> can I fetch the context of a script tag? http://jsfiddle.net/vjyay06x/
[06:13:17] <taplar> DarsVaeda: I don't believe so
[06:15:27] <taplar> it's not really nested, in the sense your thinking of
[06:16:03] <anotheryou__> uh my. how would i delay my for loop to wait for the append() each run? ...
[06:16:28] <anotheryou__> i suddenly feel the urge to program some basic
[06:16:35] <taplar> hmm? append is a blocking function, unless you do something special
[06:16:45] <DarsVaeda> taplar, yes I know it would still be great to be able to do this
[06:16:49] <Cork> anotheryou__: you don't need to wait for append
[06:17:06] <Cork> append is syncronus, unless you add html with external references
[06:17:14] <Cork> (like script, iframe or so on)
[06:17:23] <taplar> DarsVaeda: your creating multiple script blocks in the nested elements.  since your doing that, you code should know which elements it needs to lookup
[06:18:26] <DarsVaeda> no that's the point I don't know
[06:18:30] <MarkyC> $('#name') is faster than $('form#name'), correct?
[06:18:33] <DarsVaeda> they are generated but now by me
[06:18:46] <anotheryou__> Cork, oh ok. than maybe I got i bug in my code. I append, check some heights (scroll and inner) and than append again. Somehow the last append is not in the height measurements...
[06:18:46] <Cork> MarkyC: yes
[06:19:31] <Cork> anotheryou__: the browser forces a reflow of the content when you checks for the size so ya, it should be correct
[06:19:31] <taplar> DarsVaeda: is the logic done to each context unique?  or is it all the same logic?
[06:19:46] <MarkyC> Cork: Thanks. That was not immediately intuitive to me, but $('#name') likely gets translated into a getElementById, versus a sizzle search
[06:20:14] <DarsVaeda> taplar, same
[06:20:18] <Cork> MarkyC: yes, an even if you pass it through querySelector the first finds the element tag and then filters by id
[06:20:40] <Cork> and id is a hash table in the browser, so you're wasting time
[06:21:02] <taplar> DarsVaeda: then adding it multiple times is duplicating code.  you should extract it and reuse it.
[06:22:15] <MarkyC> Cork: is there ever a time specifying the tag is better than just using the class/id?
[06:22:32] <Cork> MarkyC: you might need it for classes, but never ids
[06:22:37] <MarkyC> div.foo > .sthg versus .foo > .sthg ?
[06:22:56] <taplar> you could do it for ids too
[06:22:59] <Cork> button.highligh vs a.highligh vs section.highligh
[06:23:06] <taplar> such as if the id is a different structure on different pages
[06:23:22] <Cork> MarkyC: so yes, if you want to limit the class that you use on more then one type of element
[06:23:39] <Cork> but an id can ever only exist on one element, so no point in having the tag in the selector
[06:24:08] <taplar> but if your js exists on multiple pages, :P
[06:24:31] <taplar> i just saying -never- is a bit strong
[06:34:05] <isthisreallife> https://dpaste.de/T4Qb  so i have this piece of code that resizes image keeping the aspect ratio. it does not change image height when i rotate mobile device though
[06:34:08] <isthisreallife> how to fix it?
[06:34:14] <isthisreallife> is it even possible?
[06:35:50] <taplar> which google, there appears to be an 'orientationchange' event
[06:35:55] <taplar> which = quick
[06:36:23] <taplar> or this might be something for media queries, though i'm not really familiar with then
[06:43:19] <anotheryou__> my returned height is always smaller than the real thing. But more thins are confusing. after I remove some content it kinda stays the same height (if it's true that th loop waits for append() and remove() to happen)
[06:44:05] <anotheryou__> I'll have to make a fiddle i guess..
[06:44:12] <Cork> yup :)
[06:59:00] <anotheryou__> Cork, this is how it should work, but line 9 should not be needed... https://jsfiddle.net/xeLysL0a/1/
[07:00:14] <Cork> anotheryou__: you grab the size of the element before you append to it
[07:00:23] <Cork> so the spaceLeft will be old and wrong
[07:00:57] <Cork> anotheryou__: https://jsfiddle.net/xeLysL0a/2/
[07:01:22] <anotheryou__> Cork, whops, my mistake in the fiddle hehe. but I didn't make it in the real code... ok got to search further
[07:04:45] <anotheryou__> in my code it shows height 0 after the append... maybe some css mistake where the .stuff has no height but still positions correctly
[07:05:10] <Cork> anotheryou__: is the parent in the document when you're modifying it?
[07:05:18] <Cork> height isn't calculated on fragments
[07:12:15] <anotheryou__> Cork, fond the strange 0 value. I managed to make the first position in my array empty. but trimming that made no difference so far
[07:12:27] <anotheryou__> investigating further...
[07:15:06] <anotheryou__> Cork, what is a fragment? I now found out, the height grows too little in my script....
[07:15:30] <Cork> anotheryou__: a fragment is an element that isn't connected to the document
[07:15:54] <Cork> so if you detatch() an element or create it with ex. var fragment = $('<div>');
[07:16:13] <Cork> until you append it to the document you have a fragment
[07:16:25] <anotheryou__> Cork, firebug shows me another height than outerHeight(true)...
[07:16:32] <anotheryou__> it's both in the doc
[07:16:57] <Cork> i don't think you want outerHeight(true) as that includes the margin of the element
[07:17:13] <Cork> you most likely just want to use height()
[07:17:30] <Cork> cause else you will get wrong numbers when you compare it with scrollHeight
[07:17:30] <anotheryou__> I want to avoid scrollbars and cut stuff. it's good to include the margin for me
[07:17:44] <Cork> it is the margin of the parent with the overflow though
[07:17:47] <Cork> so...
[07:18:03] <anotheryou__> ah
[07:18:44] <anotheryou__> height is too small too. hmm
[07:18:54] <anotheryou__> I'd love to have that number firebug shows
[07:19:36] <anotheryou__> it's maybe the height if the childrens paddings get ignored
[07:20:16] <anotheryou__> nope, also not exactly
[07:44:25] <RabSimpson> hi folks. anyone work with bxslider? for some reason it always loads on the clone before the first slide and when it reaches the last slide there's a delay before the next one is generated. any ideas? http://www.14lsq.co.uk/static/
[07:48:50] <anotheryou__> hm. jquery just returns a wrong height if I don't set a fixed one. I have some font-size, webfonts and rem values than influence height, but I don't know why that should lead to a wrong height...
[08:08:54] <anotheryou__> Cork, with a timeout of 1ms i get a different height after the append...
[08:11:58] <anotheryou__> ohhh i got it  i think
[08:15:36] <anotheryou__> sorry for bothering. of course it was a stuupid mistake XD
[08:16:01] <anotheryou__> i did some post-processing of a date which made my divs higher after all calculations
[08:22:36] <scrubfest> If I want to manipulate SVG elements with jquery, will I have to use a specific embed-method to make that possible?
[08:23:20] <scrubfest> If I embed with <img> will e.g $('svg') still yield results?
[08:25:55] <NoiseEee> pretty sure you can't 'manipulate' an SVG in an <img> tag at all
[08:26:10] <NoiseEee> if you want to interact w/ the SVG, it needs to be in the document properly
[08:26:44] <scrubfest> kk
[08:32:48] <ertl> hello, I have this code $(document).on('click', "#lragsocc", function (e) { // working code }); that works fine, but if I change 'click' to 'dblclick' it does not; that #lragsocc is a SELECT tag, so I think that this could be the problem... any hint? Thanks
[08:43:22] <NoiseEee> ertl: jsfiddle please
[08:44:58] <decx> can confirm, dblclick does not work on select
[08:51:16] <mentoc> How would you prepend data to a table so that a new row appears as the very first row?
[08:51:38] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[08:52:06] <mentoc> robertmaxrees: I tried that. It makes the row appear on top of the <th> row
[08:52:15] <robertmaxrees> you need to target the <tbody>
[08:52:25] <mentoc> omg you're right
[09:00:01] <smgs> robertmaxrees hi!
[09:00:07] <smgs> i was waiting for you.
[09:07:44] <anotheryou__> more noobish questions. I got an array of string stuff (some html) and now want to log additional values like in ID or something with each snippet. how would i do this? I'm a little insecure with arrays. Maybe some sort of properties would make sense? So i can say htmlStuff[n].id or something
[09:09:55] <jphase> anotheryou__: that is a little hard to make sense out of. can you make a jsfiddle for us to look at?
[09:11:38] <anotheryou__> hmmm. I'm not sure how to make a fiddle without knowing what i want :). I got an array of say "posts" and each post shall have "content" (html string), id (int) and status (true false). I don't know how to declare such a thing
[09:13:52] <jphase> objects inside of your array
[09:14:03] <anotheryou__> maybe this is what I need. but I'm still unsure on how to make the new into the array https://forum.jquery.com/topic/creating-a-class-object-with-jquery#14737000000964808
[09:14:58] <anotheryou__> line 16. has somehow go together with the decleration of the array I guess :) or at least with the filling later...
[09:15:09] <jphase> anotheryou__: http://hastebin.com/somafefoqi.xml
[09:15:25] <jphase> that's an array of objects with id and content properties set
[09:15:44] <ServerSage> Hey folks, so I'm using fullcalendar 2.3.1.  I have a source that sometimes returns nothing at all - because there are no events.  I'm getting "Cannot read property "hasTime" of undefined".  I can't figure exactly what the source should return when there are no events.
[09:15:52] <jphase> anotheryou__: not sure what your example has to do with what you need
[09:16:30] <anotheryou__> jphase, ah, thank you. still not sure what I need :). all a bit difficult.
[09:17:19] <jphase> anotheryou__: I don't understand this part: "and now want to log additional values like in ID or something with each snippet."
[09:17:20] <anotheryou__> i have a long html string of posts, which i than split into an array. Now I want to assign things like ID to each element in the new array
[09:17:52] <jphase> okay, well I'd suggest an array of objects like I showed you
[09:18:04] <anotheryou__> jphase, your example fits, I just don't want to fill the array by hand and start off with an array which is missing the "id" field
[09:18:46] <anotheryou__> js is not very type sensitive, but I still don't know where to introduce the second field (I have "content" i need the slot for "id")
[09:19:41] <jphase> anotheryou__: please try re-explaining what you need... my example shows an array of "post" objects that have both id and content set for them.
[09:19:52] <jphase> I don't know what you're needing different
[09:22:39] <anotheryou__> sorry :) jphase http://hastebin.com/zobuyadewa.xml
[09:23:08] <jphase> yes, that's right
[09:23:13] <jphase> ohhhh wait... I see
[09:23:21] <jphase> one sec - let's do a collaboration on jsfiddle
[10:14:53] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[10:15:59] <taplar> another fun day i take it
[10:16:08] <robertmaxrees> actually, yeah.
[10:16:10] <robertmaxrees> surprisingly.
[10:20:45] <jani____> hello. I have this question http://pastebin.com/V6RFD7VZ  . I mentioned my question in this pastebin in the comment.
[10:20:54] <jani____> actually I want to add a new <h2> element which will be the copy of existing one to the existing <div> using javascript/jquery
[10:21:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:21:21] <robertmaxrees> what's the question then?
[10:21:34] <robertmaxrees> you want to insert an H2, a link, both...?
[10:21:40] <Horacsio> hi again: I’m trying to build a menu that hides after x secs and then an option to show it appears after, to be called again on click, and then the timeout counts again… for now I have this: http://jsfiddle.net/baannng/g197u282/4/ but the div menu doesnt’ come out :S why?
[10:22:29] <jani____> es
[10:22:35] <jani____> yes. robertmaxrees
[10:23:25] <taplar> Horacsio: so the menu is supossed to show after the thing is hidden?
[10:23:26] <Horacsio> I also have some kind of script end issue in line 16
[10:23:53] <robertmaxrees> jani____ there's an insertAfter() method.
[10:24:00] <robertmaxrees> there's also an append().
[10:24:03] <Horacsio> yes. that div menu should appear after the div dropdown slidesleft
[10:24:20] <taplar> Horacsio: you'll want to do your showing of the menu in a done() callback after the hide finishes
[10:24:59] <taplar> as is it's not going into that else block since on load it goes into the if true part
[10:25:25] <robertmaxrees> Horacsio you should check out learn.jquery.com - you've been asking a lot of questions lately that this might cover.
[10:25:34] <jani____> robertmaxrees: how can I do this? can you guide me ?
[10:25:50] <robertmaxrees> jani____ make a fiddle.
[10:25:53] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle.net
[10:26:04] <jani____> what is jsfiddle ?
[10:26:05] <Horacsio> robertmaxrees: I’ve been doing that :) and this coding result of that :)
[10:26:19] <robertmaxrees> jani____ it's a place for you to put code so we can edit it and help you.
[10:26:23] <robertmaxrees> we can run it on the site, too.
[10:26:33] <jani____> okay.
[10:27:22] <taplar> Horacsio: also instead of checking the display css property to know if an element is displayed, you can do $(element).is(':visible') for a boolean
[10:27:52] <jani____> robertmaxrees: jsfiddle gives me this result http://jsfiddle.net/mqbfshae/
[10:28:25] <robertmaxrees> jani____ what have you actually tried?
[10:28:46] <jani____> I copy the pastebin code into the jsfiddle..
[10:28:56] <robertmaxrees> now try to do the javascript.
[10:29:09] <jani____> I dont' know javascript
[10:29:19] <robertmaxrees> now's a great time to learn!
[10:29:28] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com is a fantastic resource.
[10:29:36] <jani____> okay.
[10:29:45] <jani____> but at this time I need to solve this issue.
[10:29:57] <jani____> can you guide me /
[10:30:06] <robertmaxrees> this room can, yeah.
[10:30:40] <jani____> okay thanks
[10:30:46] <robertmaxrees> i'd use insertAfter() to do it.
[10:31:01] <jani____> how ?
[10:31:10] <robertmaxrees> you're missing a closing div tag.
[10:31:25] <robertmaxrees> does that div id="63" wrap everything here?
[10:31:27] <jani____> can you edit the jsfiddle code that
[10:31:45] <robertmaxrees> why don't you try? :) then you'll learn how to do it.
[10:32:04] <taplar> teaching room, not answers room
[10:32:08] <jani____> yes
[10:32:09] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:32:22] <robertmaxrees> so fix up the html and add the extra closing div tag.
[10:33:23] <jani____> I think I set all the closing tags.
[10:33:36] <jani____> how do you get this ?
[10:33:39] <robertmaxrees> great - update the fiddle and share the link.
[10:34:20] <jani____> it is that same link
[10:34:32] <robertmaxrees> you need to hit "update" and share the new link.
[10:34:46] <jani____> I mean that when I paste my code I set all the closing tags. if you think that I missed some then I want to know that how you get this ?
[10:34:56] <jani____> http://jsfiddle.net/mqbfshae/2/
[10:37:08] <robertmaxrees> i know because i have matching tags highlighting - didn't see one for the first opening div.
[10:37:18] <robertmaxrees> so yeah, you want to use .append() for this.
[10:37:26] <robertmaxrees> so start by selecting that containing div.
[10:37:41] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mqbfshae/3/ - this one has jquery included btw
[10:39:56] <jani____> ok
[10:40:14] <robertmaxrees> then use .append() to append the html to it.
[10:40:22] <robertmaxrees> try doing something basic do begin with, like just an element
[10:40:29] <robertmaxrees> get a feel for it, etc.
[10:41:08] <isthisreallife> var new_width = $( window ).width();
[10:41:15] <isthisreallife> why it doesnt work well on mobile devices?
[10:41:32] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[10:42:23] <jani____> robertmaxrees: how to use javascript in this ?
[10:43:03] <isthisreallife> when i set width: new_width value its much bigger than mobile device screen
[10:43:55] <nafur> Hi all!
[10:43:58] <isthisreallife> is it because i added this <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> ??
[10:44:04] <taplar> aloha
[10:44:24] <jani____> robertmaxrees: there ?
[10:44:37] <isthisreallife> hm
[10:44:42] <nafur> I'm trying to use jQuery draggable on an old iPad (iOS 5.1.1). According to the compatibility list, this should work (if I read it correctly), but it doesn't...
[10:44:46] <nafur> Demo: http://cipher-code.de/conceptmap/tests/draggable.html
[10:45:06] <nafur> This works for a reasonably current chrome, but doesn't on the iPad in question...
[10:45:26] <nafur> Any ideas about this? As far as I can tell, Safari does not give any js errors or alike...
[10:45:51] <robertmaxrees> jani____ there's a javascript pane...
[10:48:27] <jani____> but how to write jquery there ?
[10:48:34] <robertmaxrees> ? by writing it?
[10:48:39] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sure what you're asking.
[10:50:22] <km4> hi
[10:50:41] <taplar> hello km version 4
[10:50:54] <taplar> sorry to hear about version 3.  so much promise...
[10:51:51] <Uhkis> again with the weird jokes :-)
[10:52:01] <taplar> ^_^
[10:52:33] <taplar> i had some good ones, though really easy ones, the other day when people were talking about the subway guy in my office
[10:53:47] <taplar> interested?
[10:53:53] <robertmaxrees> eeeeh....
[10:53:56] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid that one.
[10:54:05] <taplar> heh, but they're 'tasteful'
[10:54:13] <taplar> that's a new one
[10:54:14] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* that's pretty bad.
[10:54:14] <Uhkis> subway guy?
[10:54:24] <taplar> yeah, he's got some legal problems.  google it
[10:54:24] <robertmaxrees> god busted for child porn.
[10:54:26] <robertmaxrees> *got
[10:54:28] <taplar> or that
[10:54:34] <RabSimpson> hi folks. anybody work with bxslider? i'm having trouble with the infinite loop illusion: http://www.14lsq.co.uk/static/ any ideas?
[10:59:27] <jani__> robertmaxrees: there ?
[10:59:31] <jani__> sorry I was offline
[10:59:39] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:59:46] <robertmaxrees> what are you confused about?
[11:06:39] <nafur> Any idea about the draggable-iOS5.1.1-problem?
[11:09:15] <robertmaxrees> nafur what's the issue again?
[11:09:32] <robertmaxrees> and what version of what browser?
[11:09:50] <nafur> I use jQuery draggable. while this works on a recent chrome, i does not work on an iPad 1 (iOS 5.1.1)
[11:10:04] <nafur> As far as I can tell, there are no js-errors or alike
[11:10:17] <robertmaxrees> current version of chrome on that device?
[11:10:27] <nafur> no, on my laptop
[11:10:42] <robertmaxrees> right, so what version of chrome on that device?
[11:11:02] <nafur> chrome 43
[11:11:16] <robertmaxrees> interesting.  wonder what might be causing that.
[11:11:24] <jani__> robertmaxrees: there ?
[11:11:28] <jani__> sorry I was offline
[11:11:31] <robertmaxrees> jani__ i have answered you a few times.
[11:11:49] <nafur> robertmaxrees: I have a demo: http://cipher-code.de/conceptmap/tests/draggable.html
[11:11:58] <jani__> actually I was offline for some time due to internet issue
[11:12:06] <robertmaxrees> nafur i saw that - i don't have that device so i can't tell you.
[11:12:16] <robertmaxrees> nafur you might want to drop in a bug report to the jquery ui team.
[11:12:29] <robertmaxrees> jani__ so what's the question?
[11:12:54] <nafur> hm, okay...
[11:12:58] <jani__> i want to add that h2 tag with link in the div using javascript/jquery
[11:13:03] <jani__> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mqbfshae/3/
[11:13:07] <robertmaxrees> jani__ right - so we started that.  where are you hung up?
[11:13:46] <jani__> I just want to know that how to write the javascript/jquery code to do this?
[11:14:13] <robertmaxrees> great.
[11:14:15] <jani__> what function/code of javascript/jquery we use for this ?
[11:14:20] <robertmaxrees> .append()
[11:14:41] <jani__> can you show me that how to use this?
[11:14:46] <robertmaxrees> i can guide you.
[11:14:53] <robertmaxrees> start by selecting the selement in question.
[11:14:58] <jani__> actually I don't know javascript/jquery thats why I am feeling difficulties to do this
[11:15:06] <robertmaxrees> that's why i'm teaching you :)
[11:15:19] <robertmaxrees> we'll guide you, but we don't write it for you.
[11:15:20] <jani__> okay thank
[11:15:26] <jani__> thanks
[11:15:34] <jani__> I need guideness
[11:15:42] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[11:16:38] <robertmaxrees> the basic gist is you select elements with $() using css selectors and then chain methods against that to do a desired operation.
[11:16:54] <robertmaxrees> if you wanted to remove all h1s on a page, for instance, you'd do $('h1').remove();
[11:19:53] <nafur> robertmaxrees: I try to file a ticket at bugs.jqueryui.com, however it tells me that it is spam because to many tickets have been created from "my ip" (which it determines to be 127.0.0.1)
[11:20:07] <jani__> robertmaxrees: i do like this http://jsfiddle.net/mqbfshae/8/
[11:20:09] <nafur> I'm pretty sure that I'm not surfing on the web as 127.0.0.1 ;-)
[11:20:21] <robertmaxrees> try github maybe?
[11:20:53] <robertmaxrees> jani__ multiline strings aren't valid like that.
[11:21:04] <MikeD_> request for comment:  http://jsfiddle.net/0k0nzg36/
[11:21:13] <nafur> issues on github are deactivated...
[11:21:28] <robertmaxrees> jani__ something like http://jsfiddle.net/mqbfshae/10/
[11:21:34] <robertmaxrees> nafur weird.  hrmmm.
[11:21:40] <robertmaxrees> maybe head to #jquery-dev and ask them what's up?
[11:22:11] <RabSimpson> ping me if you see this message
[11:22:19] <robertmaxrees> RabSimpson i see it.
[11:22:35] <MikeD_> "ping" @RabSimpson
[11:22:47] <RabSimpson> thanks folks :)
[11:23:01] <taplar> my momma said to keep my ping to myself
[11:23:14] <robertmaxrees> mikecmpbll what do you mean?
[11:23:17] <robertmaxrees> err, MikeD_
[11:23:20] <mikecmpbll> ;)
[11:24:13] <nafur> robertmaxrees: is bugs.jqueryui.com hosted by the guys at #jquery-dev or #jqueryui-dev?
[11:24:14] <MikeD_> i mean, do you have any immediate criticism of how that code is written
[11:25:11] <robertmaxrees> nafur not sure.  i
[11:25:15] <robertmaxrees> *i'd ask around.
[11:25:23] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ it's kind of strange.
[11:25:27] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to accomplish?
[11:25:55] <taplar> MikeD_: personally, i like to keep my html markup in views or whatnot and pull them in via ajax, instead of having that in the js directly
[11:26:00] <taplar> just me though
[11:26:07] <MikeD_> me?  I'm fishing for someone else to say the "WTF?" i'm thinking but maybe i just don't get it
[11:26:21] <robertmaxrees> also, use devent delegation instead of the direct binding.
[11:26:31] <taplar> also not sure why your joining on a single array element
[11:26:35] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ we're being nice.  this really isn't very good.
[11:27:35] <MikeD_> k, thanks.  My default is super critical, so i wanted to see if that was warranted here.
[11:27:38] <taplar> if .prop('disabled','disabled') works, it could also be .prop('disabled', true).  string string may just be for attr though
[11:33:05] <LindsayMac> @bansearch
[11:33:07] <LindsayMac> oops
[11:33:10] <LindsayMac> wrong room
[11:39:21] <jani__> robertmaxrees: there ? did you answer my question ?
[11:39:38] <xenaxon> hi
[11:39:49] <xenaxon> how can I scroll to a span withing a div?
[11:40:09] <taplar> xenaxon: checkout the scrollTo() function
[11:40:11] <xenaxon> I want to scroll a div's contents to a specific span
[11:40:22] <xenaxon> I know, but how do I do it smoothly?
[11:40:28] <xenaxon> I mean, with a smooth efect/transition
[11:41:15] <taplar> it takes a duration that you can give it to tell how long the animation runs
[11:41:27] <taplar> so i would assume less jumpy, more time
[11:51:27] <pokergod> I have an Object {} on console.log.  Is there a way I can access this variable
[11:51:47] <taplar> what do you mean?  your accessing it to log it
[11:51:59] <pokergod> no, i just did console.log(data)
[11:52:06] <pokergod> i want to run commands on that
[11:52:32] <taplar> just so i'm clear, are you meaning you want to do this in the console?
[11:53:04] <xenaxon> taplar: I've done it, but I'm having a BIG problem
[11:53:30] <xenaxon> taplar: I'm doing this for each word(span) in a paragraph
[11:53:46] <xenaxon> taplar: and the scrolling keeps going up down, at each word
[11:53:54] <xenaxon> taplar: how can I stop that?
[11:54:07] <taplar> xenaxon: i'd need to see a fiddle to know what your doing
[11:54:47] <pokergod> from my *.js on my site, i did console.log(data);    I see the Object in the console.log
[11:54:51] <pokergod> how can i query that ?
[11:55:09] <taplar> pokergod: what do you mean query it?
[11:55:11] <pokergod> like,  var o = ObjectFromAboveInsideConsole();
[11:55:22] <taplar> just access your data variable
[11:56:04] <taplar> data.whateverProperty
[11:56:46] <pokergod> data is not defined
[11:56:54] <pokergod> this is in a success from an .ajax call
[11:57:05] <taplar> so you would have to access it in the success callback
[11:57:46] <pokergod> I would have thought that chrome would let you access the last console.log when variable is there.. like .. $lastvar or .. $0 kind of idea
[11:58:05] <taplar> no, console sorta outside of javascripts domain
[11:58:14] <taplar> you can write to it, that's it
[11:59:52] <taplar> you'll want to process the data either in the success function or a done function, at which point the data would be available.  as ajax is async, you can't guarentee that it will exist until that point
[12:11:35] <claytonzaugg> I'm getting a specific error when clicking an image in FireFox, but not Chrome or Safari.  The error I'm getting is "TypeError: event is undefined" and the expected image swap doesn't occur.  Here's my code that sets up the event and the function that is supposed to do the swapping. https://gist.github.com/claytonzaugg/bde4daa9163531fc681f
[12:13:07] <taplar> what line gives you the error?
[12:13:29] <adavia> how can i add an active class in my <li> tag based on the link url using "popstate" https://jsfiddle.net/upcr6eoa/
[12:13:51] <taplar> claytonzaugg: if it's the pillSlider then you named your event 'eventObject', not event
[12:13:58] <claytonzaugg> taplar, line 42
[12:14:26] <claytonzaugg> event should already be defined from line 31
[12:14:45] <taplar> some browsers will protect you and make the event a more global element than it should be.  to make it work for everything, you should pass the event into the handler and use that, otherwise it is browser dependent
[12:15:53] <claytonzaugg> taplar, even if I change it from eventObject to event, same error
[12:16:28] <taplar> claytonzaugg: i don't see your binding for that event in that code sniplet
[12:16:53] <claytonzaugg> taplar, line 31, event = document.createEvent("MouseEvents");
[12:17:25] <claytonzaugg> everything else is working, just clicking the slider image in FireFox
[12:19:53] <taplar> line 31 creates an event.  i'm still not seeing where you doing an addEventListener that uses the switchPillSlider callback.
[12:24:12] <claytonzaugg> taplar, this is code I was given, so I'm trying to parse it, but line 29 is where it happens I thought
[12:24:47] <claytonzaugg> taplar, somehow it's working for the other two browsers
[12:25:30] <claytonzaugg> I'm trying to find out why it's not with FireFox, unless the other Chrome and Safari are "helping" me and FireFox is telling me to fix it.  The person who coded this built it for Chrome, now I'm trying to cross platform it
[12:25:50] <taplar> for shiggles, in the switchPillSlider console.log( eventObject ); and see what you get
[12:26:01] <claytonzaugg> okay one sec
[12:28:12] <claytonzaugg> undefined
[12:28:48] <taplar> alright, so some where something is calling that function directly, instead of it being an event handler, and is not providing it with the needed event object
[12:29:21] <ksib> Anyone familiar with Form to JSON serialization? https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/serialize-form-to-json/
[12:30:10] <taplar> ksib: jquery has that ability sure.  what's the question?
[12:31:43] <ksib> Ultimately, I have a form that I am serializing, however, I am dynamically adding more form elements with the same names. My solution is to find the first child within the form and serialize each part inside
[12:32:12] <ksib> Otherwise the result you get is Foo: bar, bar etc
[12:33:09] <ksib> I have parse through some of the content, using formData.data.push({ to access those people individually
[12:33:26] <gtek1k> if I wanted to hrie a dev for help with google matrix, any channel suggestions other than #css-lance ?
[12:33:26] <ksib> but Im having an issue when traversing inside on the form and trying to serialize
[12:33:28] <claytonzaugg> taplar, something has to bind them, I may not be showing the correct portion of code, thought I was
[12:33:51] <claytonzaugg> How else would Chrome and Safari trigger the function if it wasn't binding?
[12:33:59] <taplar> you can call a function directly
[12:34:21] <taplar> just because the parameter is named event something, does not mean it is only invoked through an event
[12:34:46] <claytonzaugg> but nothing is calling... wait, the html has a crap ton of onClick events in the html tags
[12:35:22] <taplar> claytonzaugg: one thing you could try is to see if you can get a stack trace.  try doing
[12:35:30] <taplar> var error = new Error(); console.log(error);
[12:35:43] <taplar> it should print the error to the console and it should have a stack of how you got to that function
[12:35:43] <claytonzaugg> taplar, there's a ton of these all over the place onclick="app.switchPillSlider()
[12:36:49] <jani__> hello. I have this jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/bsjw6abs/21/ . I want to copy the html element and paste it at before the closing tag of main div as in this jsfiddle. can anyone help me in this ?
[12:37:15] <claytonzaugg> taplar, here's the full context in the html <div><img src="img/slider-on.png" onclick="app.switchPillSlider()"></div>
[12:37:48] <claytonzaugg> but I'll try the error as you suggested
[12:38:05] <scrandaddy> Hey there. Can I target either of a child class in a selector? $('#form .button, #form .swatch') - is there a way I can do something like $('#form (.button or .swatch)') instead?
[12:38:06] <jani__> I am new to jquery/javascript, so if I do some mistake then please mentioned me that
[12:38:57] <taplar> scrandaddy: you could layer it.  $('#form').find('.button, .swatch')
[12:39:22] <scrandaddy> taplar: cool, no more concise way?
[12:39:33] <taplar> not that i can think of
[12:39:41] <jani__> anyone there to help me in my issue. thanks.  latest jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/bsjw6abs/34/
[12:39:54] <jani__> I want to copy the html element and paste it at before the closing tag of main div as in this jsfiddle. can anyone help me in this ?
[12:40:44] <ksib> taplar: Here is an example. Im looking to have one campaign "print" right after the other http://codepen.io/ksib/pen/MagYME
[12:40:58] <taplar> jani__: line 2 html(....) is not valid, you just need your selector and clone
[12:42:09] <claytonzaugg> Oh boy...
[12:42:17] <jani__> taplar: like this  http://jsfiddle.net/bsjw6abs/39/ but it is also not working
[12:42:48] <taplar> jani__: no a selector is $()
[12:43:09] <taplar> so you $(selector) to get the element and the .clone() that like you were.  just take off the html()
[12:43:31] <jani__> taplar: now http://jsfiddle.net/bsjw6abs/42/
[12:43:45] <claytonzaugg> taplar, I think I may have found the problem
[12:43:55] <taplar> jani__: got an extra ) at the end of your clone but yes
[12:44:10] <taplar> jani__: and then you append like your trying to, but your missing your $ on the front
[12:44:36] <taplar> $ is the jquery operator, so if your trying to do a jquery operation, it needs to start with $
[12:44:49] <taplar> or the spelled out jQuery
[12:45:07] <taplar> claytonzaugg: cool
[12:45:41] <claytonzaugg> Error: Stack trace: app.switchPillSlider@http://local.sitename.com/en/a/1/test/28728597829752/foot.js:1586:21  and  onClick@http://local.sitename.com/test:1:1
[12:46:02] <claytonzaugg> is that the reason taplar, they aren't matching locations?!
[12:46:02] <ksib> Taplar: It looks like I can't use serializeObject outside of a form tag http://codepen.io/ksib/pen/MagYME
[12:46:58] <ksib> Is there a way to select just a $('.campaign') and serialize it?
[12:48:04] <taplar> claytonzaugg: no you can call a function from different places.  check out where it says it's being called from and see how they're creating the element that is passed in.
[12:48:28] <taplar> my assumption is some where it's doing just switchPillSlider() without parameters since it was undefined
[12:48:44] <taplar> but it could be passing in a variable that is not instantiated
[12:49:16] <taplar> ksib: so your wanting to turn a single element into a json object?
[12:49:43] <ksib> Single element being a div containing <inputs>
[12:49:46] <claytonzaugg> taplar, can you explain a little more, "check out where it says it's being called from and see how they're createing theelement that is passed in"
[12:49:48] <progme> I think I am missing something fundamental... I am trying to pass a 'token' header along my ajax requests and it keeps getting stripped from the request. Any idea why? I am not getting any CORS errors. Just 401 and no token in the request header
[12:50:17] <taplar> claytonzaugg: that stack trace.  notice it's saying foot.js1586:21 ?  that's file:line:character
[12:50:34] <claytonzaugg> Oh, well that just goes directly to where I created the error
[12:50:45] <claytonzaugg> inside the switchPillSlider
[12:50:46] <taplar> so start back tracking through the stack trace
[12:50:59] <claytonzaugg> we're using twig, so everything, all the JS files are being aggregated
[12:51:11] <claytonzaugg> the stack trace was literally what I gave you
[12:52:42] <taplar> checkout the onClick
[12:52:44] <claytonzaugg> console.log(error); is where it points me to, the foot.js:1586
[12:52:57] <claytonzaugg> for that one, there IS no file listed
[12:53:24] <claytonzaugg> just the directory name .com/test:1
[12:53:35] <taplar> if you click that link does it pull up any code in your console?
[12:53:46] <claytonzaugg> Negative
[12:53:50] <taplar> :/
[12:54:13] <claytonzaugg> let me try chrome
[12:54:28] <claytonzaugg> chrome gave me something different! One sec
[12:54:53] <jani__> taplar: I am trying the same code as in jsfiddle to my working site but there it is not working.
[12:55:23] <taplar> jani__: 'not working' how?  are you getting any errors in your console?
[12:55:38] <jani__> no
[12:55:45] <claytonzaugg> taplar, the onClick takes me to the line of code in the HTML file that has the onClick that was clicked
[12:55:55] <taplar> alright, what does that look like
[12:56:03] <jani__> but it is not cloning that h3 tag and pasting
[12:56:12] <jani__> mean ?
[12:56:33] <taplar> jani__: try console logging the elements your selecting and make sure it's finding them
[12:57:00] <claytonzaugg> taplar, <img src="img/slider-off.png" onclick="app.switchPillSlider();">
[12:57:00] <jani__> don't get your point
[12:57:07] <taplar> claytonzaugg: there's your problem
[12:57:41] <taplar> jani__: try doing console.log( $('.subDiv > h3') ); and see what you get
[12:57:58] <taplar> this lets you know your finding the elements you think you should be finding
[12:58:07] <ksib> Taplar: Pretty much my end goal is instead of having the output be ["1", "1"], im looking to have it split into two sep JSON strings http://codepen.io/ksib/pen/MagYME
[12:58:08] <taplar> if you don't, then you know you have an issue there, otherwise, it's else where
[12:58:27] <claytonzaugg> but the switchPillSlider has an if else statement, if it's the on image, then swapt it out to the off image, if it's the off image, swap it to the on image
[12:59:20] <taplar> claytonzaugg: your if else is relying on an event element not passed into the function
[12:59:23] <taplar> == bad
[13:00:03] <claytonzaugg> taplar, then how is it doing it in Chrome and Safari?!
[13:00:45] <taplar> as i said earlier, some browsers will 'protect' you by making the event object more global, so when you try to access it it finds it.  not all browsers do this
[13:00:58] <taplar> to work in all browsers, you have to use the event passed in
[13:01:01] <jani__> taplar: can you check this http://pastebin.com/WgzUGbAV
[13:01:02] <claytonzaugg> Freak...
[13:01:10] <jani__> I have this code for my working site
[13:01:34] <taplar> i would but it's quittin time for me, :)  i'm sure others can/will pipe in
[13:01:41] <claytonzaugg> okay taplar, obviously I need to pass something with the onClick, how would I accomplish that? Is that a simple google search on passing parameters onClick
[13:02:14] <taplar> claytonzaugg: easiest way would be to bind to the element in your javascript.  i'm not sure if you can do onClick="function(event)" in html or not
[13:02:28] <taplar> but it's better anyway to bind in your javascript to seperate your markup from your business logic
[13:02:43] <claytonzaugg> okay, it sounds like you gotta split, but I really am grateful for your help scoping down to the problem
[13:02:57] <taplar> np
[13:03:28] <taplar> i'm outie, later all
[13:08:29] <jani__> can anyone please check this http://pastebin.com/WgzUGbAV  that whats the issue in this ?
[13:10:51] <claytonzaugg> sorry jani__ not sure, hopefully someone else will see this and offer to help
[13:11:11] <rindolf> jani__: looks fine at first glance.
[13:14:58] <jani__> but then why it is not working
[13:15:30] <jani__> having this issue http://prntscr.com/898ik3
[13:16:27] <rindolf> jani__: ah, it should be }) instead of )}
[13:17:04] <rindolf> jani__: and you should have a ; after that.
[13:17:30] <jani__> okay. let me check
[13:18:13] <jani__> and what is this error now ? http://prntscr.com/898jv5
[13:19:18] <jani__> rindolf: can you check it ?
[13:19:31] <rindolf> jani__: $ is not defined.
[13:19:51] <rindolf> jani__: you may need to use jQuery() insetad of $()
[13:19:55] <jani__> is it needs definition ? where and how ?
[13:20:02] <jani__> ok
[13:21:16] <rindolf> jani__: it is defined by default i think.
[13:21:20] <jani__> and this is what ? http://prntscr.com/898lg3
[13:22:04] <jani__> I have this dummy jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/bsjw6abs/49/ and I am applying this idea in my working site. but it is not working there
[13:22:10] <rindolf> jani__: can you provide more context?
[13:23:49] <jani__> I am working on my localhost. so what kind of context do you want me to provide ?
[13:25:57] <jani__> it is the browser inspect code http://pastebin.com/mywuyDS1
[13:26:03] <Bloomberg> Hello
[13:26:06] <jani__> is it helpful ?
[13:26:10] <robertmaxrees> jani__ you need to put that whole script tag right before the closing body tag.  also - make sure you're loading jquery.
[13:27:05] <jani__> its already in that way. mean before the </body> tag
[13:27:16] <robertmaxrees> that's what i just said.
[13:27:25] <robertmaxrees> your screenshot shows it after
[13:27:32] <robertmaxrees> and you don'y have jquery loaded.
[13:27:37] <jani__> okay now I do that
[13:28:11] <robertmaxrees> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script> <- put this anywhere before your script.
[13:29:18] <jani__> http://prntscr.com/898p5f this is loaded before that code
[13:29:35] <robertmaxrees> it's obviously not working or you have noconflict running.
[13:29:50] <robertmaxrees> open your network tab and make sure it's not returning a 404.
[13:31:19] <jani__> network tab snapshot http://prntscr.com/898q4n
[13:31:27] <robertmaxrees> that's really unhelpful.
[13:31:33] <robertmaxrees> you need to learn this yourself.
[13:31:46] <robertmaxrees> check to see if jquery successfully loaded.
[13:31:59] <jani__> how to check this ?
[13:32:08] <robertmaxrees> search for it and see what the "Status" field says
[13:32:10] <jani__> is there anyway to check this ?
[13:33:22] <jani__> Status field has no 404 error
[13:33:32] <robertmaxrees> what does it say for jquery?
[13:34:52] <jani__> robertmaxrees: http://prntscr.com/898ry4
[13:35:07] <robertmaxrees> please stop sharing screenshots.
[13:35:10] <robertmaxrees> it's really not helpful.
[13:35:35] <robertmaxrees> and it sounds like you have jquery in noconflict mode.  open your console and type $.fn.jquery - what do you get?
[13:35:55] <jani__> okay
[13:36:44] <jani__> it gives 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'fn' of undefined' and some other line of message too
[13:36:48] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:36:54] <robertmaxrees> now try jQuery.fn.jquery
[13:36:57] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[13:37:22] <jani__> "1.11.2"  this is the result
[13:37:30] <jani__> so what does these means ?
[13:37:37] <robertmaxrees> that means you're running in noconflict mode.
[13:37:46] <robertmaxrees> you need to use the word jQuery instead of $ in your code.
[13:37:51] <robertmaxrees> or wrap it in an iife
[13:37:52] <jani__> so what should I do ?
[13:38:37] <jani__> but I am using jQuery not $ in the code like Ihere 'var getTitle = jQuery('#blog-posts > .fusion-post-large > .fusion-post-slideshow > ul > li > .fusion-rollover-title').clone();'
[13:38:40] <tasaif> What did HTML5 introduce besides semantic markup and form validations?
[13:40:16] <robertmaxrees> jani__ huh?
[13:40:38] <jani__> and it is still not working
[13:40:45] <robertmaxrees> jani__ open your console then.
[13:40:49] <robertmaxrees> what does it say on the page?
[13:40:51] <jani__> I am very confused with this
[13:41:05] <robertmaxrees> jani__ so are we - we're not able to see the page in action so it's very hard for us to help.
[13:41:38] <jani__> it doesn't copy/clone that html element and paste/
[13:41:54] <jani__> like it is working in the jsfiddle that I shared before
[13:41:59] <robertmaxrees> any errors in your js console?
[13:42:43] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/bsjw6abs/49/ you said this is what you're using, right?
[13:43:33] <jani__> i just get this in the console http://prntscr.com/898vxk sorry that I am sharing the snapshot again. but I have no other mean to show you this :(
[13:43:52] <robertmaxrees> so you don't have any errors?
[13:44:02] <robertmaxrees> without seeing it live, i have no idea then.
[13:44:13] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 is a good guide.
[13:44:14] <jani__> yes I am using that jsfiddle idea
[13:44:18] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com is a good place, too.
[13:45:10] <jani__> you need to put it online ?
[13:45:30] <robertmaxrees> i don't need to do anything ;)
[13:46:03] <jani__> okay let me do this.
[13:46:12] <robertmaxrees> seriously though, check out those guides.
[13:46:14] <robertmaxrees> they will help you.
[13:49:40] <jani__> robertmaxrees: it is the online url http://zericdejuan.com/blog/
[13:50:12] <robertmaxrees> your jquery object isn't matching anything.
[13:50:16] <robertmaxrees> *selector
[13:50:57] <jani__> mean the class names are wrong ?
[13:51:10] <robertmaxrees> i mean  jQuery('#blog-posts > .fusion-post-large > .fusion-post-slideshow > ul > li > .fusion-rollover-title') doesn't match anything.
[13:51:29] <robertmaxrees> try just jQuery('#blog-posts .fusion-rollover-title');
[13:51:44] <jani__> okay
[13:51:47] <robertmaxrees> though this code won't do what you want it to do.
[13:52:35] <jani__> you mean to try this jQuery('#blog-posts .fusion-rollover-title').clone(); ?
[13:52:40] <robertmaxrees> yes
[13:52:58] <robertmaxrees> but again, that won't do what you want it to do.
[13:53:09] <robertmaxrees> why aren't you doing this server-side?
[13:53:39] <jani__> server-side mean ?
[13:53:46] <robertmaxrees> in wordpress.
[13:53:58] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to update that template instead/.
[13:55:10] <jani__> now it is getting that title. but getting all the titles for each item
[13:55:18] <jani__> can you please have a look at this ?
[13:55:23] <robertmaxrees> right, because this code doens't do what you want.
[13:55:33] <robertmaxrees> you should be doinmg this via wordpress, not javascript.
[13:55:34] <jani__> then what should I do ?
[13:55:46] <robertmaxrees> do this in wordpress
[13:55:48] <robertmaxrees> fix the template.
[13:56:00] <jani__> I want it to do with wordpress.
[13:56:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:56:08] <jani__> mean *javascript
[13:56:10] <robertmaxrees> why?
[13:56:16] <robertmaxrees> javascript is a bad way to do this.
[13:56:27] <jani__> is it possible in javascript ?
[13:56:39] <robertmaxrees> it's possible, but not ideal.
[13:56:43] <jani__> if yes then I prefer that way instead of wordpress
[13:56:54] <robertmaxrees> then you need to learn how to use it.
[13:56:55] <jani__> if possible then how ?
[13:57:02] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com :)
[13:57:18] <jani__> okay
[13:57:33] <robertmaxrees> you need to learn jquery, otherwise we're going to spoonfeed you everything.
[13:57:36] <jani__> but that will take some time from me. while I need to fix this issue now :(
[13:57:48] <robertmaxrees> why now?
[13:57:57] <robertmaxrees> why are you writing code for a site if you don't know how to code?
[13:58:12] <MXBrandon> is there a way to an item that was clicked without setting an event?  For example:    <a href="javascript: $(this).hide();">Hide me</a>
[13:58:14] <jani__> because the project is already live and it needs little bit bug fixings
[13:58:24] <robertmaxrees> jani__ then fix the bugs server-side.
[13:58:28] <delboy1978uk> hi guys
[13:58:39] <robertmaxrees> MXBrandon why can't you set an event handler?
[13:59:13] <MXBrandon> robert:  Its just a one-time link. Trying to avoid excessive ID tags and code in the <script> tags
[13:59:14] <delboy1978uk> why would $('#choose-team').change(function(){ not trigger from html loaded in through .load()? the document ready works because i sent an alert();
[13:59:17] <robertmaxrees> jani__ if you're really stuck on using JS to do this (though i really don't understand why), you need to use .each() here.
[13:59:26] <robertmaxrees> MXBrandon inline event handlers are a bad idea.
[13:59:32] <robertmaxrees> you should give the link a class and use an event handler.
[13:59:40] <robertmaxrees> it's not excessive at that point, just organized :)
[14:00:03] <robertmaxrees> delboy1978uk  $('#choose-team') is loaded via the load function?
[14:00:20] <robertmaxrees> because if so, that's why - the for for .on() is running before it that element exists.
[14:00:22] <delboy1978uk> yes its a dynamically populated <select>
[14:00:36] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation instead.
[14:00:42] <MXBrandon> robertmaxrees: What is the reason that inline event handlers are bad?  Just asking so I know the reason WHY I should avoid it, instead of just saying "ok" :)
[14:01:00] <delboy1978uk> so .on(‘change’,function(){//blah}) then?
[14:01:04] <robertmaxrees> MXBrandon separations of concern are a good thing.  populating html with javascript is really unorganized.
[14:01:08] <robertmaxrees> delboy1978uk that's not delegated.
[14:01:16] <delboy1978uk> because i was trying that too and it didnt work either
[14:01:18] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('change', '#choose-team', function() {});l
[14:01:37] <delboy1978uk> ah!
[14:01:39] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:01:45] <delboy1978uk> ok let me try that
[14:01:52] * delboy1978uk clicks some keys
[14:02:14] <robertmaxrees> MXBrandon think about it - if you were to come back and maintain that page in a few years, where are you going to look for your js?  in a js file?
[14:02:31] <robertmaxrees> or hunting through your html?
[14:04:01] <delboy1978uk> robertmaxrees: thanks a lot amigo, its all working as it did before!
[14:04:03] <MXBrandon> robert: Yeah, I agree with you on that.  I have organized code on that stuff.  For this particular thing, I was just whipping up a temporary script to migrate some data.  Once it was clicked, it would disappear.  There is no JS file.  It just got me thinking HOW to assign it inline
[14:04:04] <delboy1978uk> :-D
[14:04:07] <robertmaxrees> delboy1978uk awesome.
[14:04:26] <robertmaxrees> MXBrandon yeah, put everything in external files basically always.
[14:07:19] <MXBrandon> I agree, however this is one of those cases where this page will be deleted in 60 minutes so I was being lazy ;)
[14:12:05] <Latopao> hello
[14:13:21] <tasaif> jani__, pay someone to fix it
[14:14:15] <jani__> okay. thanks
[14:15:09] <Latopao> <input type="checkbox" checked onclick="removeprogchild(event)"/>
[14:15:14] <robertmaxrees> D:
[14:15:20] <robertmaxrees> don't use onclick=
[14:15:45] <Latopao> would have some way to check if is checked with event properties?
[14:15:54] <robertmaxrees> .on('change', function() {});
[14:15:57] <robertmaxrees> not onclick
[14:16:18] <robertmaxrees> though really you want to abstract out the function and call that as necessary instead.
[14:20:20] <tasaif> Latopao, http://jsfiddle.net/jrmhw92n/
[14:21:14] <delboy1978uk> hi again guys, having a similar problem within another ajax loading page, i changed to use the on(‘click’ for this one which is fine but club = $('#stubclub').val(); doesnt work either, how would i access that one?
[14:21:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:21:26] <robertmaxrees> show us more code.
[14:21:31] <bango2> Latopao to use that though you need to include jquery js library FYI
[14:21:36] <delboy1978uk> another ajax page
[14:21:42] <delboy1978uk> an on click triggers ok
[14:21:49] <bango2> hello delboy1978uk
[14:21:51] <robertmaxrees> delboy1978uk you mean .on('click', 'child', function() {}); ?
[14:21:57] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, no way for us to know what's going on.
[14:21:58] <delboy1978uk> but the value aint being grabbed in that function for #stubclub element
[14:22:09] <delboy1978uk> yeah thats right
[14:22:23] <delboy1978uk> hi bango2
[14:23:07] <delboy1978uk> its literally just a textbox im trying to get the value for within that onclick
[14:23:20] <robertmaxrees> if that's the id, that's how you'd do iut.
[14:23:33] <robertmaxrees> there's only one element with that ID, right?
[14:23:51] <delboy1978uk> yeah, but again its on that ajax loaded page so it isnt picking up
[14:24:04] <robertmaxrees> is the click event binding firing?
[14:24:16] <robertmaxrees> is it bound to a parent element that exists on pageload?
[14:24:27] <delboy1978uk> yes, i altered it to the new way you shown me and i can alert within that
[14:24:45] <robertmaxrees> try $('[id="stubclub"]').length
[14:24:47] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[14:24:52] <delboy1978uk> 2 secs
[14:24:54] * delboy1978uk tries
[14:25:46] <delboy1978uk> 2?
[14:25:54] <robertmaxrees> there's your problem.
[14:25:58] <bango2> i remember where I had to use element.textContent or  element.innerText because val() wasn't returning the right thing
[14:26:04] <robertmaxrees> you're duplicating IDs - jquery is only getting the first one.
[14:26:24] <delboy1978uk> really, there are two elements with that name?
[14:26:26] <robertmaxrees> bango2 .val() is for inputs.  you needed .text() that case.
[14:26:28] <delboy1978uk> grr, let me go look
[14:26:30] <robertmaxrees> delboy1978uk that's what that means.
[14:26:30] <delboy1978uk> thanks again
[14:26:37] <bango2> ah, i stand corrected
[14:30:27] <isthisreallife> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/BoBNMd  why something like this does not work on mobile device?
[14:30:47] <isthisreallife> input is way too big on mobile device
[14:31:28] <isthisreallife> is it because of  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">   ???
[14:31:36] <isthisreallife> cant figure it out
[14:31:59] <tasaif> what are you trying to do?
[14:32:41] <delboy1978uk> i changed it from stubclub to customstubclub but now it says 0? here’s the snippet oh code that ajax loads: http://pastebin.com/eBz80gPr
[14:33:06] <robertmaxrees> ypi
[14:33:14] <robertmaxrees> *you're not loading the JS via ajax, right?
[14:33:48] <delboy1978uk> yes
[14:33:58] <robertmaxrees> "yes" meaning....?
[14:34:02] <tasaif> isthisreallife, http://codepen.io/anon/pen/WQevWz
[14:34:17] <delboy1978uk> that snippet gets called into a div with load();
[14:34:22] <robertmaxrees> uh
[14:34:27] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[14:34:27] <delboy1978uk> ah ok.
[14:34:35] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation instead.
[14:34:52] <robertmaxrees> and the .done() method.
[14:35:02] <isthisreallife> tasaif  what kind of magic is this o_O
[14:35:05] <delboy1978uk> so ive used the event delegation for the onclick, can i just move that onto the parent pages script now?
[14:35:07] <isthisreallife> thanks :)
[14:35:20] <tasaif>  np
[14:35:25] <robertmaxrees> delboy1978uk sure.  yopu need to fix your variable declarations though.
[14:35:32] <tasaif> make sure whenever you use calc that you have a space on each side of your operator
[14:35:34] <delboy1978uk> in which way?
[14:35:46] <robertmaxrees> your league and club vars are never declared.
[14:35:53] <robertmaxrees> you need to slap 'var' in from of them.
[14:35:59] <delboy1978uk> lol you are right
[14:36:00] <robertmaxrees> same with 'b'
[14:36:02] <delboy1978uk> :P
[14:36:35] <robertmaxrees> also, i'd get out of the habit of using alert() to debug
[14:37:11] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/9a19daa202cb this is a touch cleaner.
[14:38:03] <tasaif> $('[id="customstubclub"]').length
[14:38:06] <tasaif> what's going on here?
[14:38:14] <robertmaxrees> i had him put that in.
[14:38:31] <robertmaxrees> $('[id="customstubclub"]').length and $('#customstubclub').length are distinct.
[14:38:36] <robertmaxrees> the latter will always return 0 or 1.
[14:38:51] <robertmaxrees> the former will return however many are actually on the page with that ID.
[14:39:54] <tasaif> that makes sense
[14:40:11] <tasaif> but why would there be multiple objects with the same id on the same page?
[14:40:21] <robertmaxrees> he's figuring that out now ;)
[14:40:28] <robertmaxrees> people make mistakes.
[14:40:49] <tasaif> ah never mind me
[14:41:07] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:41:57] <delboy1978uk> hmm i moved it into the parent file and put var in front of the two vars but still undefined :(
[14:42:03] <robertmaxrees> what's undefined?
[14:42:37] <delboy1978uk> var club = $('#customstubclub').val();
[14:43:14] <robertmaxrees> is that an input or something else?
[14:43:19] <robertmaxrees> like, is it spelled right?
[14:44:02] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to select it after it loads?  or before?
[14:44:02] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[14:45:36] <delboy1978uk> ah. now its on the page with .load(‘/wherever’), should it go in an after function there?
[14:46:13] <robertmaxrees> do it in the .done() of the callback.
[15:46:34] <smgs> robertmaxrees hi
[15:47:04] <robertmaxrees> yo
[15:47:38] <smgs> robertmaxrees :) got to ask another 5 character length thing. :) going to create a fiddle. :)
[15:47:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:47:56] <robertmaxrees> there are over 650 people in here - toss it out to the channel :)
[15:48:19] <smgs> already tossed in the channel. no response. creating fiddle now
[15:48:45] <robertmaxrees> not sure when, but okay.
[15:53:00] <smgs> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/46k1vy6c/ // the click() line or function os required after every line. i dont know how to put that in the last blcok of code.
[15:53:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:53:50] <robertmaxrees> this isn't a complete example.
[15:53:57] <smgs> HTML too ?
[15:54:03] <robertmaxrees> a functioning example.
[15:54:20] <smgs> i should post the HTML too ?
[15:54:28] <robertmaxrees> you should create a fully functioning example/.
[15:54:30] <smgs> it is very very large..
[15:54:39] <robertmaxrees> i don't need the entire page.
[15:54:46] <robertmaxrees> what you've given me has no context.
[15:54:51] <robertmaxrees> so i can't really help.
[15:55:01] <robertmaxrees> make a paried down example that illustrates the problem.
[15:55:09] <smgs> paried ?
[15:55:29] <robertmaxrees> *paired
[15:55:33] <robertmaxrees> simplified
[15:55:50] <smgs> robertmaxrees, i want to press the submit button when the 5th character is pressed. the exact same thing from last time..
[15:56:05] <robertmaxrees> i don't remember anything about what you had ;)
[15:56:33] <smgs> you only helped me with it. you might remember.
[15:56:38] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:56:41] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[15:56:43] <smgs> :(
[15:56:58] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/xjth59r5/
[15:57:06] <smgs> first two lines run separately works. also the pressing of submit button too works..
[15:57:09] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy to get the length of the input.
[15:58:17] <smgs> document.getElementsByName("E_Value")[0].focus(); document.getElementsByName("E_Value")[0].click();
[15:58:29] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what that code has to do with anything.
[15:58:30] <smgs> these two works ok. also the pressing of submit button too works.
[15:58:46] <smgs> but does not work when i add the if length >=5 part..
[15:58:52] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle and show me.
[15:58:56] <robertmaxrees> pretty basic stuff here.
[15:58:59] <smgs> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/46k1vy6c/ // the click() line or function os required after every line. i dont know how to put that in the last blcok of code.
[15:59:14] <robertmaxrees> copy/pasting your question won't change anything..
[15:59:33] <smgs> that is the fiddle. you asked for it again.
[15:59:39] <robertmaxrees> i asked for a functioning fiddle.
[15:59:46] <robertmaxrees> also - document.getElementsByName("Ecom_Captcha_Value").keyup(function(event) { won't work.
[15:59:59] <smgs> ohhh. why ?
[15:59:59] <robertmaxrees> open your console - you'll see why there.
[16:00:06] <smgs> console ?
[16:00:17] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[16:00:20] <robertmaxrees> check this guide out :)
[16:00:31] <smgs> reading.
[16:15:31] <smgs> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/46k1vy6c/1/, i tried my level best to show this time.
[16:15:46] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:15:48] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[16:15:50] <robertmaxrees> this is really easy.
[16:15:53] <adavia> how can i add an active class in my <li> tag based on the link url using "popstate" https://jsfiddle.net/upcr6eoa/
[16:16:12] <robertmaxrees> smgs you need to use a jquery selector for .keyup to work.
[16:16:30] <smgs> hmm,, ? robertmaxrees
[16:16:43] <robertmaxrees> $(), not what you've got now.
[16:17:05] <smgs> just that... trying. robertmaxrees
[16:18:30] <robertmaxrees> $('.paymentinputtd input').keyup
[16:18:33] <robertmaxrees> try that instead.
[16:20:07] <smgs> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/46k1vy6c/3/ ?
[16:20:28] <smgs> wait
[16:21:08] <smgs> $('Ecom_Captcha_Value').keyup(fu .... :(
[16:21:11] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:21:15] <smgs> wait. again..
[16:21:17] <robertmaxrees> i already gave you the answer.
[16:22:00] <smgs> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/46k1vy6c/4/ ?
[16:22:11] <robertmaxrees> you tell me.
[16:22:13] <robertmaxrees> did you try it?
[16:22:19] <smgs> yes.. on that fiddle page.
[16:22:22] <adavia> maybe something like this is close? https://jsfiddle.net/upcr6eoa/2/
[16:22:28] <robertmaxrees> smgs try on your other page.
[16:22:39] <smgs> robertmaxrees. ok. wait. :)
[16:25:19] <smgs> robertmaxrees, http://pastebin.com/AnS93wdr, :(
[16:25:33] <smgs> tried it on the other page, the one required
[16:28:12] <smgs> robertmaxrees, tried it with $(.value) and $(value)
[16:28:49] <hydraidm801> I am so confused why doesn't this work? https://jsfiddle.net/wjjjtpnh/
[16:30:04] <tasaif> because it's got no motivation
[16:31:25] <hydraidm801> the date objects are exactly the same
[16:31:30] <tasaif> oh
[16:31:48] <tasaif> in javascript when you compare two objects, you're actually comparing pointers
[16:31:58] <tasaif> you're not comparing the contents of the objects
[16:32:15] <tasaif> try comparing their epoch times instead
[16:34:27] <tasaif> Number(start_time) might work I think?
[16:34:57] <tasaif> hydraidm801, https://jsfiddle.net/wjjjtpnh/1/
[16:37:44] <hydraidm801> tasaif: so basically JS can't compare Date objects unless they are transformed to Numbers first?
[16:38:10] <tasaif> kind of
[16:38:32] <tasaif> when you do date1 == date2, you're checking to see if both of the dates are pointing to the same object
[16:38:39] <hydraidm801> weird
[16:38:52] <tasaif> yea
[16:38:59] <hydraidm801> Number(start_time) and Number(val) both equal 1440082800000
[16:38:59] <tasaif> you'll see the same behaviour with arrays
[16:39:16] <hydraidm801> so weird
[16:39:39] <hydraidm801> guess I'm just used to all the niceties with python's date and time objects
[16:40:09] <smgs> robertmaxrees, really i tried all the permutations. :(
[16:40:23] <tasaif> do you understand what Number(start_time) does?
[16:41:13] <tasaif> if you need clarification, it turns it into this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time#Encoding_time_as_a_number
[16:41:40] <robertmaxrees> smgs dude i'm at work ;)
[16:41:47] <robertmaxrees> i can't be your personal guide.
[16:41:52] <robertmaxrees> put your questions out to the channel :)
[16:41:54] <smgs> ok. peace. robertmaxrees. thanks. :)
[16:42:03] <tasaif> lol
[16:42:18] <robertmaxrees> i can answer questions sometimes, but i'm not always around.
[16:42:35] <tasaif> irc etiquette guys
[16:42:51] <hydraidm801> tasaif: I'm assuming it converts Date object to a number of just it's milliseconds from 1970. Am I close?
[16:43:26] <tasaif> Yea, you got the idea. I don't know the specifics either.
[16:43:58] <tasaif> looks like it's january 1, 1970
[16:44:06] <hydraidm801> the Unix epoch
[16:44:20] <hydraidm801> the day Mr.Ritchie started up Unix
[16:44:25] <hydraidm801> and Mr.Kernigan
[16:44:45] <robertmaxrees> yep
[16:45:15] <tasaif> all hail Kernigan and Ritchie
[16:45:36] <hydraidm801> for real
[16:45:36] <tasaif> deliver us from the woes of the proprietary
[16:46:26] <robertmaxrees> "woes" lol
[16:56:44] <smgs> robertmaxree_s, you were my last hope..
[16:56:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:57:06] <smgs> yup.
[16:57:17] <smgs> dont want to disturb you. you are at work.
[16:57:25] <robertmaxrees> ask the room then dude.
[16:57:32] <robertmaxrees> i'm not the only person available to help.
[16:57:42] <smgs> i really did try all the combinations. also i guess it is in the room only
[16:57:45] <robertmaxrees> and i can help right now - i was just pointing that out because you kept trying to ping me.
[16:57:56] <smgs> ok.
[16:58:04] <tasaif> smgs, what are you doing?
[16:58:12] <robertmaxrees> trying to learn the basics of event binding.
[16:58:26] <tasaif> without delegation?
[16:58:32] <smgs> tasaif, https://jsfiddle.net/46k1vy6c/5/
[16:58:36] <robertmaxrees> they won't read learn.jquery.com
[16:58:46] <smgs> want to press the submit button on 5th character being pressed
[16:59:24] <tasaif> your indentation is terrible and it makes it hard to understand what's going on
[16:59:24] <robertmaxrees> what you have there should work fine duder.
[16:59:32] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/46k1vy6c/7/
[16:59:36] <robertmaxrees> works find in the fiddle.
[16:59:47] <robertmaxrees> though there's a button callin some function that isn't on the page.
[17:00:20] <smgs> f*** it works on that fiddle page. trying again on the main page.
[17:01:23] <tasaif> robertmaxrees, you were my last hope
[17:01:27] <tasaif> I'm doomed
[17:01:28] <robertmaxrees> lol wtf
[17:01:35] <robertmaxrees> sup princess leia
[17:01:59] <tasaif> that's pretty good
[17:02:12] <tasaif> I have no witty response to that
[17:03:18] <smgs> tasaif, i am witty. Don't you worry. Not that techno-savvy, but can handle you.
[17:04:55] <WitlessTheHandle> handled*
[17:09:23] <WitlessTheHandle> smgs, is your #SubmitBtn in a form?
[17:09:49] <smgs> it is a button. Witless. i dont know what you mean by form
[17:10:00] <smgs> it looks the same in the original page as it looks in the fiddle
[17:11:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:11:42] <smgs> nope. :( it does not work the page required. but it works on the fiddle..
[17:15:05] <robertmaxrees> any console errors on the page?
[17:17:17] <smgs> i think it is form. tasaif. robertmaxree_s not sure.
[17:17:32] <robertmaxrees> why do you keep putting an underscore in my username?
[17:17:41] <robertmaxrees> and open your console to find out....
[17:17:51] <tasaif> smgs, https://jsfiddle.net/46k1vy6c/12/
[17:17:57] <smgs> checking
[17:18:11] <smgs> robertmaxrees, because i dont want to ping you
[17:18:11] <robertmaxrees> no need for var $ecom = $('[name="Ecom_Captcha_Value"]').focus();
[17:18:15] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[17:18:31] <tasaif> oh yea, forgot that there
[17:18:31] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:19:02] <tasaif> still an improvement
[17:19:19] <smgs> robertmaxrees, because you said you are working/at work
[17:19:34] <tasaif> leaving work
[17:19:35] <tasaif> cya guys
[17:19:45] <smgs> just a min. checking
[17:19:46] <tasaif> smgs, try khan academy
[17:19:48] <smgs> tasaif ^
[17:20:02] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean you can't ping me, smgs
[17:20:56] <robertmaxrees> smgs i was trying to tell you that repeatedly trying to get my attention like you were earlier was a little extreme.  that's all :)
[17:21:13] <smgs> $('.paymentinputtd input').on('keyup', function(event){    var $this = $(this); if ($this.val().length >= 5) {        $('#SubmitBtn').submit();   }});
[17:21:16] <smgs> did not work
[17:21:27] <robertmaxrees> please don't paste code in the channel like that ;)
[17:21:37] <smgs> just 2 line. sorry
[17:21:44] <robertmaxrees> yeah, please don't ;)
[17:21:50] <smgs> ok. peace
[17:21:52] <robertmaxrees> is  $('#SubmitBtn') a form element or the button element.
[17:22:22] <smgs> how can i find it? can i paste the whole html code in private message to you. it might have something private.
[17:22:27] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:22:33] <robertmaxrees> use your developer tools and select it.
[17:22:57] <smgs> wo.. what.. trying. on IE
[17:23:07] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.  IE has developer tools.
[17:24:42] <smgs> it would take time. in case you could just handle this single paste in pm. ?
[17:24:47] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:24:52] <smgs> ok
[17:24:56] <robertmaxrees> you need to learn how to do this yourself :)
[17:25:13] <robertmaxrees> right click - inspect element.
[17:25:16] <robertmaxrees> this is very easy.
[17:28:14] <smgs> https://gyazo.com/8f1a35d4e3dbbc7c6d80e860f56e0f2e on IE. how to know if it is FORM or not ?
[17:28:32] <smgs> on chrome Inspect Element i cannot yet utilise correclt.
[17:28:58] <robertmaxrees> that's an old version of IE.
[17:29:04] <robertmaxrees> why not use chrome?
[17:29:30] <smgs> i was on chrome only. ok. after inspect element, what next ?
[17:30:01] <robertmaxrees> go to the console
[17:30:10] <smgs> robertmaxrees, wait i cannot open inspect element of that submit button on chrome. it does not appear, it is hidden or something
[17:30:21] <robertmaxrees> hit f12 on your keyboard.
[17:30:25] <robertmaxrees> in chrome
[17:30:32] <robertmaxrees> then click the "console" tab.
[17:30:42] <smgs> done! all in RED
[17:30:51] <robertmaxrees> enter this:
[17:30:51] <robertmaxrees> $('#SubmitBtn')
[17:30:54] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[17:30:59] <smgs> https://gyazo.com/670c1192386f2201247991810830d2d1
[17:31:03] <smgs> trying
[17:31:26] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:31:30] <smgs> <input class="button" type="button" name="paymentChoice" id="SubmitBtn" value="Submit" onclick="validate();">
[17:31:34] <robertmaxrees> it's a button
[17:31:37] <smgs> wow! that is INTERESTING!!!!
[17:31:41] <robertmaxrees> you need to use .click() not submit.
[17:31:41] <smgs> THANKS. :)
[17:31:52] <smgs> rightaway! trying
[17:33:18] <smgs> http://pastebin.com/0PVnm3k9 still not working
[17:33:34] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[17:33:50] <smgs> how to know that ?
[17:33:56] <robertmaxrees> look at the console.
[17:34:54] <smgs> https://gyazo.com/de5b77d9250f41b9481531010782e6b2
[17:35:12] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:35:24] <robertmaxrees> have you verified if jquery is even available on this page?
[17:35:54] <smgs> document.getElementsByName
[17:36:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:36:01] <smgs> this method works on that page ^.
[17:36:07] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't answer my question.
[17:37:21] <smgs> wait. i say again that this method that is document.getElementsByName works on that page. and pressing of the submit button is the last part of the code.
[17:37:27] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:37:31] <robertmaxrees> that is not answering my question.
[17:37:37] <robertmaxrees> is jquery available on the page you're working on?
[17:37:49] <smgs> how to know. goolging..
[17:38:03] <robertmaxrees> before your code, enter console.log($.fn.jquery);
[17:38:43] <robertmaxrees> what does your console say?
[17:39:10] <smgs> ...some code.... console.log($.fn.jquery);$('.paymentinputtd input......... like this ?
[17:39:18] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[17:39:20] <smgs> ok.
[17:39:26] <robertmaxrees> what do you get in your console?
[17:39:39] <smgs> a second. doing
[17:40:20] <smgs> done. but i gess the same one line error as that of last time
[17:40:35] <robertmaxrees> that means jquery isn't defined dude.
[17:40:41] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[17:40:58] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you replace every instance of $ in your code with jQuery ?
[17:41:06] <smgs> :( but that getElementsBy name method works..
[17:41:12] <robertmaxrees> that isn't jquery.
[17:41:19] <smgs> :(
[17:41:33] <robertmaxrees> you can do this without jquery.
[17:42:11] <smgs> there is no $ in my original code. $ only comes into play when trying to pressing the submit button as suggested by you. :)
[17:42:19] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:42:25] <robertmaxrees> you're in the jquery support channel.
[17:42:30] <robertmaxrees> the assumption is that you're using jquery.
[17:42:54] <smgs> f**** so that means jQuery and javascript are different .. :(
[17:43:02] <robertmaxrees> jquery is a javascript library.
[17:43:18] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/02e89cce1317 something like this might work.
[17:43:25] <smgs> so many things.... trying now. :)
[17:46:28] <smgs> http://pastebin.com/m11Pdcb4
[17:46:40] <robertmaxrees> why do you keep making them one line?
[17:47:06] <smgs> because i have made bookmarks of them. and to run them i just press the bookmark-let
[17:47:13] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[17:47:21] <robertmaxrees> that's the exact code i gave you soooo...
[17:47:53] <smgs> for every thing else i need two lines. the last one is always the .click() one.
[17:48:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:48:12] <smgs> so i am putting a line with .focus() just above it in the if block. checking
[17:49:52] <smgs> http://pastebin.com/G7zpCWyq
[17:50:08] <robertmaxrees> document.querySelector('#SubmitBtn').focus(); you don'
[17:50:09] <robertmaxrees> t need this
[17:50:21] <smgs> i dont know why but we always need the second line with .click()
[17:50:32] <robertmaxrees> the click is the part you need/.
[17:50:38] <smgs> so i think it has to be added in that the keyup event
[17:50:41] <robertmaxrees> the focus is irrelevant.
[17:50:43] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:50:54] <smgs> it is really. .click() part
[17:50:56] <robertmaxrees> the focus isn't doing anything for us there.
[17:51:25] <smgs> okies. if it aint we need the .click() part for that keyup event/line of code
[17:51:32] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:51:41] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to click that button, right?
[17:51:49] <smgs> yes
[17:51:52] <robertmaxrees> if so, document.querySelector('#SubmitBtn').click(); will do that.
[17:51:54] <robertmaxrees> nothing else needed.
[17:52:50] <smgs> robertmaxrees, http://pastebin.com/FUyc8uAz
[17:52:57] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:53:06] <robertmaxrees> please preformat code before sharing itout like this.
[17:53:14] <smgs> ok. doing it again.
[17:53:19] <robertmaxrees> you don't need focus there.
[17:53:22] <robertmaxrees> remove that line.
[17:53:25] <robertmaxrees> it's not necessary.
[17:53:31] <smgs> ok.removing..
[17:54:01] <robertmaxrees> i don't know how else i can help you at this point.  are you saying this does not work?
[17:54:26] <smgs> yes. exactly.
[17:54:32] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[17:54:34] <smgs> trying one more again. time
[17:54:45] <robertmaxrees> you're not giving us anything to work with and are basically just copy/pasting things.
[17:54:59] <robertmaxrees> you really need to spend some time learning javascript and getting a handle on how it works.
[17:55:04] <robertmaxrees> that's really what you need here.
[17:55:10] <smgs> in PM, could paste the whole HTML...
[17:55:19] <robertmaxrees> that's not a reasonable option.
[17:55:28] <smgs> one time. last time
[17:55:31] <robertmaxrees> you're copy/pasting code.
[17:55:40] <robertmaxrees> you're not learning anything.
[17:56:40] <smgs> might i??
[17:56:46] <robertmaxrees> do what?
[17:56:49] <smgs> i am learning... really. but slowly
[17:56:59] <smgs> paste the whole HTML of the webpage
[17:57:02] <robertmaxrees> please don't.
[17:57:23] <snover> robertmaxrees: come on, throw caution to the wind!!
[17:57:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:57:40] <robertmaxrees> it's completely counter to the point of the channel.
[17:57:41] <snover> “today, i learned not to throw caution to the wind.”
[17:57:56] <robertmaxrees> and it's not going to help anything.
[17:58:50] <smgs> the code you suggested does not seem to work on jsfiddle https://jsfiddle.net/46k1vy6c/13/
[17:59:11] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[17:59:12] <robertmaxrees> i see why ;)
[17:59:26] <smgs> opened.
[17:59:48] <smgs> https://gyazo.com/f84b4c4b834c2be1072e985fbfeb9f9e
[17:59:50] <robertmaxrees> see the problem?
[18:00:00] <robertmaxrees> try figuring it out yourself duder.
[18:00:05] <smgs> we need getelemts by name?
[18:00:12] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:00:31] <robertmaxrees> small typo on my behalf.
[18:00:32] <smgs> document.getElementsByName this method we need.
[18:00:36] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:01:01] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/46k1vy6c/14/
[18:01:04] <smgs> now
[18:01:44] <smgs> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/46k1vy6c/14/ nope
[18:01:51] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:02:13] <smgs> when i press the 5th character it does not press the submit button...
[18:02:21] <robertmaxrees> yes it does.
[18:02:38] <smgs> wait.
[18:03:46] <smgs> made a gif.
[18:03:54] <robertmaxrees> a gif is not a fiddle.
[18:04:04] <smgs> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/46k1vy6c/14/
[18:04:04] <robertmaxrees> if your page isn't working, open your console and debug the problem.
[18:04:09] <snover> if is if you have no hands
[18:04:18] <smgs> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/46k1vy6c/14/
[18:04:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:04:25] <arc_> may i just add that the functionality you're trying to implement is a bad idea to begin with
[18:04:31] <robertmaxrees> smgs why are you spamming that link?
[18:04:32] <arc_> you don't want autosubmit when someone makes a typo
[18:04:40] <robertmaxrees> he's making a userscript.
[18:04:46] <smgs> f*** copy pasting error. sorry
[18:04:47] <robertmaxrees> for himself.
[18:04:52] <arc_> i see..
[18:04:52] <smgs> https://gyazo.com/71ef77a819aac8aa056891555c1806d5
[18:05:01] <smgs> i meant to post that ^. profuse aplogies
[18:05:05] <robertmaxrees> error
[18:05:16] <robertmaxrees> try debugging it yourself.
[18:05:50] <smgs> :(
[18:05:58] <robertmaxrees> also: this is no longer really a jquery thing - you really want to be in ##javascript at this point.
[18:06:23] <smgs> but you said it works...
[18:06:27] <robertmaxrees> it does.
[18:06:45] <smgs> i made a gif to prove it does not.
[18:06:45] <robertmaxrees> in the fiddle, it does exactly what you want it to do.
[18:06:52] <robertmaxrees> that page is showing an error.
[18:06:56] <robertmaxrees> try to debug the problem on the page.
[18:07:07] <robertmaxrees> since I don't have access to it, i can't tell you anything other than "learn to code"
[18:07:08] <smgs> but on fiddler does it work ?
[18:07:24] <smgs> i dont see the pressing of the submit button.
[18:07:32] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[18:07:37] <robertmaxrees> i feel like a broken record.
[18:07:46] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle shows it's trying to call the validate function, which breaks.
[18:07:56] <arc_> it's doing what you told it to do, but clicking the button doesn't do anything. the console will show you the error
[18:08:16] <robertmaxrees> the fiddle doesn't containe the validate function, so you don't see anything related to that.
[18:08:27] <robertmaxrees> but the console will show you that the function gets called - the button is getting clicked.
[18:09:30] <robertmaxrees> until you can make a fiddle that replicates the full problem, there's really nothing we can do to help you here.  you can try asking in ##javascript, but they might not be of much help either.
[18:10:10] <arc_> i'm guessing he didn't test it on the actual page yet because he thought it wasn't working in jsfiddle
[18:10:17] <arc_> i don't see why that wouldn't work on the actual page
[18:10:27] <robertmaxrees> because the actual page is doing some strange things
[18:10:32] <smgs> console is empty no red lines this time. but the button does not get pressed.
[18:10:50] <robertmaxrees> smgs sounds like you need to learn to debug code then.
[18:11:04] <robertmaxrees> fixingthesejquery.com is a good resource for this.
[18:11:18] <robertmaxrees> the ##javascript chat room is where you want to be now since this has nothing to do with jquery any more :)
[18:11:34] <smgs> NO RED lines at least. :)
[18:12:53] <smgs> robertmaxrees, document.querySelector('.paymentinputtd input').addEventListener('keyup', function() ........... for this line to work, we surely need another line with the same things + a .click() in the end. i pasted that. you said it is wrongly indented/formatted. please do look.
[18:13:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:13:15] <smgs> .click() is required for everyline to work. yes.
[18:13:27] <robertmaxrees> please take it to ##javascript.
[18:13:39] <smgs> ok. peace. thanks. :) :)
[18:14:10] <arc_> smh
[18:14:20] <robertmaxrees> circular discussions.
[18:15:13] <arc_> drives me crazy when people who clearly need a lot of help assume they know better than the person they're asking
[18:15:39] <robertmaxrees> or are generally argumentative?
[18:15:45] <arc_> certainly doesn't help
[18:15:59] <robertmaxrees> i really get bothered when people are here not to learn, but to copy/paste.
[18:16:02] <smgs> arc_ come on! i came in here after ##javascript code worked and i asked for the auto clicking.
[18:16:25] <robertmaxrees> smgs you didn't check to make sure you even had jquery available on the page for how many hours?
[18:17:07] <smgs> robertmaxrees.. wo! is there a page limit too? damm.. trying again.
[18:17:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:17:25] <smgs> i will go berserk soon it seems
[18:17:50] <arc_> you're basically asking other people to do everything for you instead of trying to figure it out yourself with some advice, which says to me that you don't really know enough, yet at the same time you're trying to tell the person you're asking for advice how it should be done
[18:17:54] <arc_> doesn't make sense
[18:18:01] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:18:14] <robertmaxrees> then completely ignoring us when we try to give you better resources.
[18:18:52] <arc_> believe me, if robertmaxrees says it should be done a certain way, it probably should be done that way
[18:19:00] <robertmaxrees> d'awwww thanks.
[18:19:06] <arc_> :p
[18:19:24] <robertmaxrees> but seriously, i speak from a lot of experience and have a lot of resources you can use to learn to do these kinds of things.
[18:19:30] <smgs> OK. please forgive me. robertmaxrees, you told me things like jsfiddle and console. i could never learn it on my own. THANKS. and that 5th character code too. i am hell grateful
[18:28:48] <smgs> anwyas this the formatted code, there is always a .click() line https://bpaste.net/show/9e226b700b13
[18:43:58] <acidjazz> my life is a .click() line
[19:07:35] <printForever> can I combine slice and each?
[19:08:07] <printForever> I'm trying to fade in LI items, selected by .slice() and fadeIn() each() of them
[19:08:56] <shoky_> yes
[19:09:04] <shoky_> you can also just .slice().fadeIn()
[19:10:26] <printForever> but I want to each of them, separately
[19:10:33] <printForever> I'm creating a test case
[19:11:05] <shoky_> anyway, slice returns a jquery object, and you can run .each() on jquery object
[19:11:06] <shoky_> s
[19:12:01] <printForever> http://pastebin.com/9UxFxU2c
[19:12:55] <printForever> shoky_: does this plausible?
[19:13:00] <shoky_> that's fine, except the removeClass will happen immediately, doesn't seem you'd want that
[19:13:04] <printForever> problem is... they all show up
[19:13:15] <printForever> I want to remove the class and select another 8
[19:13:16] <shoky_> you probably want to put the removeClsas in a callback of the .fadeOut
[19:13:23] <printForever> if I leave the class it would go over the same thing
[19:13:34] <shoky_> oh, fadeIn, i was thinking fade out
[19:13:39] <printForever> right
[19:13:52] <printForever> problem is... all 8 are loaded right away
[19:14:02] <printForever> and no effect goes of
[19:15:04] <printForever> it's like each() is not doing anything
[19:15:27] <shoky_> the hidden class hides them?
[19:15:36] <printForever> via css, yes
[19:15:44] <printForever> display: none
[19:15:48] <shoky_> so , the removeClass is happening immediately
[19:15:54] <shoky_> which causes them to appear immediately
[19:16:02] <printForever> ok...
[19:16:06] <printForever> ok
[19:16:11] <printForever> let me try that
[19:16:39] <shoky_> put the removeClass in the fadeIn's callback
[19:17:49] <printForever> OMG
[19:17:52] <printForever> you where right
[19:18:13] <acidjazz> you should use css to fade btw
[19:18:22] <acidjazz> better for gpu
[19:20:08] <printForever> hm...
[19:20:24] <printForever> I still have to read a lot about keeping jQuery low on resources
[19:21:52] <adavia> how can i add an active class in my <li> tag based on the link url using "popstate" https://jsfiddle.net/upcr6eoa/2/
[19:27:41] <printForever> shoky_: can I get one more advice
[19:28:14] <printForever> I'm looking to remove the a#showmore anchor and replace it with a different button
[19:28:35] <printForever> once all LI elements are shown (that means that all .hidden classes are removed)
[19:30:10] <printForever> my idea was to use if(li.hidden) exists and if does not remove() it and show different element inside callback
[19:30:20] <printForever> is that a good idea?
[19:33:53] <printForever> acidjazz: can you help me with the logic of this?
[20:49:55] <shibly> Which one is correct json format? {"page": "1"} or {page: "1"}
[20:51:59] <jphase> shibly: {"page":1} would be the way json_encode functions would spit out an object with that property/value pair
[20:56:04] <shibly> How to get the value of page? variable['page'] or variable.page?
[20:56:08] <shibly> jphase: ^
[20:56:36] <jphase> variable.page
[20:56:53] <jphase> to be perfectly fair, there's really no such thing as an array in javascript though
[21:04:34] <printForever> I can't run function() as a callback in removeClass()
[21:04:41] <printForever> what would replace this?
[21:08:23] <jphase> printForever: what are you trying to do?
[21:08:47] <printForever> um... I want to run .show() after .removeCss()
[21:09:03] <printForever> but .removeCss() does not accept callbacks
[21:09:06] <printForever> so...
[21:09:25] <printForever> .removeClass()   - .not removeCss() sorry
[21:09:36] <printForever> jphase
[21:10:02] <jphase> printForever: yeah that callback in .removeClass() is just for returning a list of classnames to remove
[21:10:06] <jphase> you can use a promise for that
[21:10:26] <printForever> promise?
[21:10:53] <printForever> never heard of .promise()
[21:11:07] <nodist> !promise
[21:11:44] <printForever> I do... but what?
[21:12:28] <nodist> lol, I thought there was a bot here
[21:12:49] <printForever> :)
[21:12:54] <printForever> I'm looking at API jquery
[21:13:10] <printForever> and I'm looking at the examples, but the last example does not contain .promise()
[21:13:53] <printForever> anyway, how do I use it? nodist, jphase? .removeClass('.class').promise( function() {})?
[21:14:20] <nodist> give me a sec I am making an example
[21:15:28] <nodist> printForever are you trying to do something live this? http://jsfiddle.net/87dt2nyg/
[21:15:33] <printForever> oh... I'm looking at the API and there seems to be a .done()
[21:15:37] <printForever> that accepts callbacks
[21:16:56] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/87dt2nyg/3/
[21:17:16] <printForever> after .removeClass('hidden') I want to run a callback
[21:18:49] <printForever> nodist, this http://jsfiddle.net/87dt2nyg/4/
[21:19:36] <jphase> printForever: sorry - afk a bit right now. so wait... you have no asynchronous elements and you just want to do like... $('.something').removeClass('something').show(); ?
[21:19:44] <jphase> and show is happening before removeClass somehow?
[21:19:47] <printForever> jphase http://jsfiddle.net/87dt2nyg/4/
[21:20:12] <jphase> oh
[21:20:25] <jphase> that's not the way that works in there in removeClass params
[21:20:26] <printForever> after there are no more .hidden, I want to remove anchor
[21:20:32] <printForever> I know
[21:20:37] <jphase> oh okay
[21:20:40] <printForever> .removeClass does not accept function
[21:20:46] <printForever> I dont know what else to use
[21:20:55] <printForever> I'm looking for something that would do the job
[21:21:00] <jphase> you don't use a callback mang ;)
[21:21:06] <jphase> jQuery is the land of chained methods
[21:21:24] <jphase> $(this).removeClass('hidden').show();
[21:21:31] <printForever> ooooook... and...
[21:21:35] <printForever> but I need to check the IF
[21:21:36] <jphase> or if you need the conditional like that then just put the show call in there or put the whole call in there
[21:21:40] <jphase> ^
[21:21:55] <printForever> I dont follow, sorry jphase
[21:22:12] <jphase> if ( your length condition ) { $(this).removeClass('hidden').show(); } else { $(this).addClass('hide').hide(); }
[21:22:22] <jphase> granted, not sure why you're using both a class toggle AND the show/hide methods
[21:23:07] <jphase> hmmm
[21:23:07] <jphase> also
[21:23:17] <jphase> your fadeins don't need to be looped through
[21:23:20] <printForever> jphase, I tried that... does not work :/
[21:23:28] <printForever> look
[21:23:29] <jphase> you can apply the .fadeIn() to the whole selector full of object
[21:23:32] <jphase> objects*
[21:23:32] <printForever> I already have something that works
[21:23:36] <printForever> and a reason why its working
[21:23:45] <printForever> I'm looking for a very specific solution
[21:23:48] <printForever> for a very specific problem
[21:24:01] <printForever> the edited example, shows what I need http://jsfiddle.net/87dt2nyg/4/
[21:24:16] <printForever> I need to remove the anchor after all classes are removed from LI elements
[21:24:19] <printForever> thats all
[21:24:57] <jphase> okay, well if you want to be a little entitled brat and not give me the full synopsis and use case of a problem and expect me to help you troubleshoot your poor syntax for free, then I have better things to do my friend
[21:25:01] <printForever> but, as you can see, it cant be dazy chained because there are, at least 2 clicks
[21:25:04] <jphase> not enough info for such attitude
[21:25:25] <jphase> and I have my own stuff I'm coding - tell me what you're trying to do overall and I'll help you restructure your code so it makes sense
[21:25:38] <jphase> but please don't get pissy with me when I'm volunteering my time (that I am using to code my own stuff)
[21:25:40] <printForever> I want to add callback to removeClass?
[21:25:51] <printForever> thats not possible
[21:25:55] <printForever> what is the replacement?
[21:26:11] <printForever> thats all I'm asking
[21:26:25] <printForever> you are getting upset because you dont understand the problem
[21:26:53] <jphase> .removeClass() is not an asynchronous event - it literally would be just putting a ; at the end of it, hitting the enter key, and doing the next operations that your "callback" would perform
[21:26:59] <printForever> after I described it, shown the code and presented a working version... what else should have I done?
[21:27:17] <jphase> first, you shouldn't give attitude to people offering their time to help you
[21:27:20] <jphase> that's where you started to fail here
[21:27:36] <printForever> I truly am not, and I'm sorry if you feel like that
[21:27:52] <jphase> secondly, it literally makes zero sense to "add a callback to .removeClass()" because it doesn't take time to perform lol
[21:28:18] <printForever> "because it doesn't take time to perform" - what do you mean by this?
[21:28:20] <jphase> there will never be a case where the second operation happens first here:    $('div').removeClass('blah');  $('div').show();
[21:28:41] <jphase> well a callback event/function is for things that take time to perform
[21:28:51] <jphase> i.e. run ______ code after ______ happens
[21:29:17] <jphase> but .removeClass(); simply removes classes from a jQuery DOM object - so if you need to perform another operation afterwards, then just do that on the next line or chain a method to the end of that
[21:29:19] <jphase> no callback needed
[21:29:28] <jphase> if you want to make your own method, then you can do that by extending the jQuery object
[21:29:32] <printForever> before coming here I did that
[21:29:35] <printForever> and nothing happened
[21:29:51] <printForever> I checked selectors, I checked the code, I checked the code on outside example, the code works
[21:29:57] <jphase> okay, let's start with that then
[21:29:59] <printForever> but it simply isn't working after
[21:30:01] <jphase> that's the problem we need to troubleshoot
[21:30:15] <printForever> its the same exact code I posted to fiddle
[21:30:32] <printForever> if I put IF after .removeClass() in the new line
[21:30:36] <printForever> it just does not execute
[21:31:35] <jphase> printForever: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/87dt2nyg/5/
[21:31:38] <jphase> literally just like that
[21:31:39] <jphase> no callback
[21:32:07] <printForever> I did it :)
[21:32:15] <printForever> and it does. not. work.
[21:32:18] <printForever> :/
[21:32:28] <jphase> LOL jesus christ dude
[21:32:32] <jphase> wtf are you wanting it to do
[21:32:39] <printForever> ok, I'll update the fiddle
[21:32:42] <jphase> can you just stop making me try to guess wtf this is supposed to do? lol
[21:32:47] <nodist> what do you mean by does not work?
[21:32:50] <nodist> that^
[21:32:52] <printForever> sec
[21:33:05] * jphase reaches for bong to calm down 
[21:34:02] <printForever> this > http://jsfiddle.net/87dt2nyg/6/

[21:34:48] <printForever> wow... it works?!
[21:34:52] <printForever> but...
[21:34:55] <printForever> how
[21:35:02] * jphase shoots himself in the face
[21:36:00] <printForever> OMG
[21:36:07] <printForever> jphase
[21:36:11] <printForever> I forgot the remove selector
[21:36:19] <printForever> it was an ID and I haven't put #
[21:36:22] <printForever> sorry man
[21:36:27] <printForever> really sorry
[21:36:34] <printForever> nodist thank you
[21:36:38] <printForever> I'm such an asshole
[21:36:45] <jphase> this is why it's important to tell me what you're trying to accomplish so I can assess the entire situtation
[21:36:46] <printForever> complete retard
[21:36:49] <jphase> it's called debugging and rubber ducking
[21:36:55] <printForever> I. am. really sorry
[21:37:03] <jphase> all good, now you know for next time ;)
[21:37:04] <printForever> I forgot the bloody selector
[21:37:08] <jphase> happens
[21:37:14] <jphase> facepalms are usually the issue
[21:37:15] <printForever> I will check 50 times before I ask again
[21:37:29] <jphase> no no, just say "weird... I want this to do ______ but it's doing ______ instead"
[21:37:31] <jphase> and link to code
[21:37:33] <jphase> code
[21:37:37] <jphase> done*
