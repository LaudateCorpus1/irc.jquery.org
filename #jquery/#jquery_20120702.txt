[00:00:07] <gnarf> its like the basic concept of why we write apps
[00:00:35] <gnarf> but "temporary" is a horrible word to describe creating a DOMElement and storing it in a variable
[00:00:54] <tintin> Then what word should i use to define this condition
[00:01:05] <gnarf> "in memory" ?
[00:01:25] <tintin> as all DOMElement created by jquery/javascript doesn't reside in memory
[00:01:44] <gnarf> um, yes they do?
[00:02:00] <Hereisanotherlie> I think it just might be the work of a troll
[00:02:02] <gnarf> all objects created by javascript and even the browser reside in memory
[00:02:14] <systemfault> Hereisanotherlie: He's just mentally challenged..
[00:02:30] <systemfault> Hereisanotherlie: Whirl3d spend like 6 hours helping him… for nothing.
[00:02:35] <systemfault> (Yesterday)
[00:02:38] <tintin> gnarf: But if you reload won't it be gone?
[00:02:40] <Hereisanotherlie> poor guy
[00:02:53] <systemfault> Seriously...
[00:02:55] <tintin> gnarf: How many times does it store in memory?
[00:02:55] <systemfault> Whirl3d++
[00:03:06] <gnarf> tintin: every time you create one?
[00:03:28] <gnarf> tintin: if my bot were here, he would be telling you to go learn javascript
[00:03:39] <Hereisanotherlie> soooo…. gnarl tell me more about this library you're creating
[00:03:43] <Hereisanotherlie> gnarf*
[00:03:44] <gnarf> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript/
[00:04:01] <gnarf> tintin: ^^^^^
[00:04:04] <systemfault> gnarf: Tell us about your library..
[00:04:38] <tintin> gnarf: Yes, when you create a new DOMElement how many times does it live in memory?
[00:04:44] <gnarf> sadly - its not worth talking about, I am maintaining/reducing someone elses - and its for a private company so
[00:04:49] <systemfault> 34.6 seconds.
[00:04:58] <gnarf> tintin: learn javascript please
[00:05:01] <systemfault> gnarf: Ah :(
[00:05:09] <blackspotwiggins> learn how a computer works i think
[00:05:22] <blackspotwiggins> next he'll start to argue about quantum states inside RAM
[00:05:22] <systemfault> gnarf: Your company also suffers from the NIH syndrome? :P
[00:05:24] <Hereisanotherlie> offing javascript, how does it work
[00:05:27] <Hereisanotherlie> effing*
[00:05:36] <gnarf> systemfault: NIH?
[00:05:37] <tintin> lolol
[00:06:10] <tintin> I know javascript
[00:06:13] <Es0teric> what is the $.fn in jquery do?
[00:06:14] <systemfault> gnarf: Not Invented Here… some company won't ever use a piece of software that was not created by them.. so they're reinventing the wheel all the time.
[00:06:17] <Es0teric> *what does
[00:06:26] <Hereisanotherlie> tintin: well that is apparently not the case
[00:06:36] <systemfault> gnarf: The company where I work is like that for the backend
[00:06:41] <tintin> Why don't you just answer the question?
[00:06:46] <tintin> gnarf: ^
[00:06:52] <tintin> ARe you paid to support here?
[00:06:52] <gnarf> systemfault: more like the wheel didn't really exist when the application began, nor did any of the employees know where to look for them
[00:07:00] <gnarf> systemfault: there is legacy code to support
[00:07:03] <systemfault> Es0teric: If you know javascript, $.fn is the same as $.prototype
[00:07:12] <Es0teric> OHHH ok
[00:07:15] <systemfault> gnarf: Ah ok :D
[00:07:29] <Es0teric> systemfault thanks
[00:07:30] <gnarf> Es0teric: jQuery.fn = jQuery.prototype;
[00:07:33] <gnarf> Es0teric: literaly
[00:07:38] <Es0teric> i see i see
[00:07:38] <blackspotwiggins> Es0teric, basically it means methods available on jquery collections
[00:08:02] <gnarf> tintin: no
[00:08:24] <blackspotwiggins> tintin, if you are interested, read the source on webkit and/or firefox
[00:08:26] <systemfault> People helping here are just giving back to the community.
[00:10:18] <coldhead> i'm not giving back shit, i'm just here to meet hot guys
[00:10:28] <coldhead> and run my fingers through their beards
[00:10:34] <systemfault> Oh yeah
[00:10:36] <gnarf> coldhead: too bad danheberden is AFK
[00:10:41] <gnarf> he's sexy
[00:10:42] <coldhead> too bad indeed
[00:10:48] <coldhead> he is painfully handsome
[00:11:00] <gnarf> and wears shirts with hippos
[00:11:05] <gnarf> <3
[00:11:08] <blackspotwiggins> hmm
[00:11:16] <blackspotwiggins> i wonder what the beard:person ratio is in #jquery
[00:11:25] <gnarf> paul_irish is also not around
[00:11:32] <gnarf> he's pretty hawt in plaid
[00:11:36] <blackspotwiggins> now paul with beard i'd like to see :D
[00:11:50] <systemfault> With beard and a beer in his hand
[00:12:14] <Hereisanotherlie> I grew my first beard after watching life aquatic, going in the ocean with a beard seemed so rewarding
[00:12:17] <tintin> blackspotwiggins: So i'm right, all created DOMElement bye jquery/javascript are temporary issue
[00:12:23] <systemfault> He could act like gandalft for added awesomeness
[00:12:26] <systemfault> -t
[00:12:31] <amitprakash> Hi, if a certain script I wrote causes jquery to crash at some point, how can I figure out what line in my script is invoking the jquery function which crashes?
[00:12:42] <gnarf> tintin: temporary is a horrible word
[00:12:56] <tintin> gnarf: So what is the correct word to use?
[00:13:02] <tintin> gnarf: temporary = ?
[00:13:15] <blackspotwiggins> tintin, all everything ever created by js is temporary
[00:13:19] <gnarf> tintin: i dunno- its just a bad word
[00:13:20] <blackspotwiggins> or any program
[00:13:23] <gnarf> it means nothing
[00:13:27] <systemfault> and life
[00:13:28] <blackspotwiggins> as soon as you close it, it's gone
[00:13:31] <gnarf> because its all "temporary" until you write it down
[00:13:35] <gnarf> just like the thoughts in your head
[00:13:44] <gnarf> you'll remember them until you die
[00:13:48] <gnarf> but if you write them down
[00:13:51] <gnarf> someone else can read them
[00:13:58] <gnarf> or your next life can
[00:13:59] <coldhead> who is this mysterious someone
[00:14:00] <tintin> gnarf: "all everything ever created by js is temporary" does this make sense? blackspotwiggins said this
[00:14:06] <coldhead> why are they going through my papers when i die
[00:14:10] <gnarf> of course it makes sense
[00:14:15] <Hereisanotherlie> tintin: if you really want to get down to the nitty gritty all data is temporary. All of our hardware is going to disintegrate and become dust. All of this is eventually for nothing
[00:14:19] <gnarf> learn how RAM and programs work in general
[00:14:30] <gnarf> you need to read like every book on that mdn link
[00:14:33] <blackspotwiggins> exactly wat i said..
[00:14:35] <tintin> I know about ram
[00:14:50] <tintin> gnarf: I said exactly the same as blackspotwiggins said
[00:15:04] <gnarf> and in the meantime stop asking people who have been doing this for 15 years to teach you how to poop in a toilet
[00:15:08] <tintin> gnarf: I also used the word "temporary" as blackspotwiggins used
[00:15:10] <gnarf> please
[00:15:28] <Hereisanotherlie> gnarf: how to poop in toilet please
[00:15:30] <blackspotwiggins> tintin, im using the definition you gave
[00:15:30] <gnarf> tintin: beacuse EVERYTHING is "temporary" variables are just variables
[00:15:51] <blackspotwiggins> tintin, maybe you are temporary program running inside a quantum computer
[00:16:01] <gnarf> they are resident in memory until they are either collected by the garbage collector because they have no further references
[00:16:05] <gnarf> or the page unloads
[00:16:15] <tintin> blackspotwiggins: lol
[00:16:22] <gnarf> tintin: now please, go read MDN's learn page
[00:16:25] <gnarf> and click on those books
[00:16:27] <gnarf> and read them
[00:16:30] <gnarf> all of them
[00:16:33] <Whirl3d> with more than 300 posts, most of them duplicates over the past three days, I think it's safe to say that tintin is trollin' and y'all are just playing along
[00:16:36] <gnarf> each one taught me something
[00:16:46] <tintin> This? http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript
[00:16:53] <gnarf> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript/
[00:16:56] <gnarf> pick one and go
[00:16:58] <gnarf> shoo
[00:17:22] <systemfault> Whirl3d: Hi my love
[00:17:31] <gnarf> tintin: if you have a question about something you read in there
[00:17:32] <gnarf> please ask
[00:17:39] <coldhead> nice delousing, Whirl3d
[00:17:41] <gnarf> especially if it relates to jQuery
[00:17:57] <tintin> gnarf: Ok, you can say that it js stores in memory for sometims, but if you reloads the page, isn't it gone?
[00:18:26] <gnarf> please read some of those books, then ask questions tomorrow
[00:18:38] <gnarf> you've used up your three questions
[00:18:39] * systemfault whistles the Final Fantasy VII fanfare
[00:18:52] <systemfault> gnarf gets 25XP
[00:18:58] <systemfault> And a buster sword
[00:19:03] <coldhead> you took the 3 questions clause out of the topic, gnarf!
[00:19:11] <coldhead> no one knows about the limit anymore!
[00:20:12] <Whirl3d> even fewer know about common courtesy...
[00:21:20] <gnarf> http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/
[00:21:43] <blackspotwiggins> ehh
[00:21:56] <blackspotwiggins> i think the mistake is looking for a philosophical discussion on #jquery
[00:22:12] <systemfault> gnarf: Nice :P
[00:23:08] <coldhead> but what really IS a philsophical discussion
[00:23:14] <coldhead> when you get down to it
[00:24:16] <systemfault> Something boring?
[00:25:09] <systemfault> lol
[00:25:12] <Whirl3d> that article is terrific, gnarf. I expected it to be kinda cheesy, but it's well thought out...
[00:25:25] <systemfault> He's done trolling here.. so ##Javascript is the next  target :D
[00:25:47] <Es0teric> all of these sliders are garbage...
[00:25:48] <Es0teric> -_-
[00:26:10] <Es0teric> nivo, bootstrap-carousel, the one that comes in foundation 3
[00:26:51] <gnarf> Es0teric: what is your target browsers?
[00:27:01] <gnarf> because you can do a pretty decent slider with pure css animation
[00:27:04] <g2musicgroup> How do I convert this var makeOption = document.createElement('option'); to jquery?
[00:27:06] <Whirl3d> gallery scripts are terrible for the most part as well.
[00:27:08] <gnarf> look at any speaker deck
[00:27:13] <gnarf> reveal.js
[00:27:20] <gnarf> deck.js
[00:27:21] <gnarf> etc
[00:27:26] <systemfault> g2musicgroup: $('<option></option>')
[00:27:32] <Es0teric> gnarf any browser...
[00:27:45] <g2musicgroup> thank you systemfault
[00:27:49] <gnarf> Es0teric: then you can still do a pretty decent one with pure css
[00:27:51] <gnarf> :)
[00:27:57] <Es0teric> i just want it to slide through my WP content on the homepage.. but i keep getting a url problem
[00:27:58] <gnarf> Es0teric: it just wont be super animated
[00:28:25] <gnarf> Es0teric: define your url problem?
[00:28:50] <g2musicgroup> systemfault: would I have better optimization if I said $(<option>')
[00:28:50] <Es0teric> gnarf when i activate nivo slider, jquery console keeps showing me undefined appended to the url
[00:28:52] <Es0teric> for some reason
[00:28:58] <gnarf> Es0teric: you can use add/remove class on lis
[00:29:14] <gnarf> Es0teric: have you tried asking nivoSlider's author?
[00:29:23] <systemfault> g2musicgroup: I guess, not sure I would call it an optimization though :P
[00:29:38] <Es0teric> gnarf well the nivoslider's author would probably tell me to get the nivoslider built specifically for wordpress but i have no desire to spend the money for it
[00:29:53] <g2musicgroup> systemfault: K
[00:30:00] <Es0teric> in fact, im actually thinking of rebuilding my site's backend entirely on cakephp or CI
[00:30:15] <gnarf> Es0teric: just to let you know - jQuery is moving to wordpress to host all of our sites
[00:30:22] <gnarf> its a pretty powerful platform
[00:30:32] <gnarf> we are pushing content into it via a node.js process
[00:30:33] <Es0teric> gnarf yes i know... i have wordpress as a CMS righ tnow
[00:30:40] <codeAssassin> gnarf: what's wrong with Drupal?
[00:30:44] <Es0teric> drupal sucks
[00:30:47] <Es0teric> joomla sucks
[00:30:49] <gnarf> we author our content using github repos now
[00:30:59] <gnarf> and use grunt to deploy it to the server
[00:31:04] <Hereisanotherlie> I wouldn't say drupal or joomla suck really
[00:31:08] <codeAssassin> i don't really find drupal that sucky though, compared to most systems out there
[00:31:27] <gnarf> codeAssassin: i never said anything was wrong with drupal
[00:31:30] <Es0teric> wordpress at its core is better than drupal and joomla combined...
[00:31:42] <Es0teric> and its more secure, the problem lies in the plugins that bring in the vulns
[00:31:49] <Hereisanotherlie> Es0teric: that definitely depends on what you're trying to do
[00:31:57] <blackspotwiggins> aww
[00:31:59] <blackspotwiggins> he left
[00:32:48] <codeAssassin> gnarf: i'm sure that there is a valid reason for it, i just wondered why ;)
[00:32:50] <gnarf> codeAssassin: I'm not in the habit of bashing any product without offering the use cases it fails for
[00:33:06] <gnarf> and since I've never actually used the project
[00:33:07] <dgx> blackspotwiggins:  He didn't left, he is #javascript channel now ;)
[00:33:35] <gnarf> you should post the vampires link at him over there too
[00:34:00] <blackspotwiggins> dgx, yea enjoying the show
[00:34:02] <blackspotwiggins> there
[00:34:31] <Es0teric> gnarf, well come to think about it, i just want to slide two images anyways...
[00:34:40] <Es0teric> its not like i have 5+ images
[00:34:51] <gnarf> Es0teric: classes + css should solve the case no matter what
[00:34:56] <gnarf> and you can make sexy animations in css3
[00:35:08] <gnarf> that just result in a "quick turn" in non-supported browsers
[00:36:16] <Es0teric> gnarf do you have a site that shows it?
[00:36:30] <gnarf> Es0teric: lemme hunt
[00:39:38] <gnarf> Es0teric: it appears the site i wrote this for isn't online
[00:40:46] <jarco> how can i prevent a click function i cal on an ul>li to also fire when a ul li ul li is clicked?
[00:41:05] <jarco> a second nested ul that is
[00:41:29] <blackspotwiggins> jarco, e.stopPropagation();
[00:42:36] <gnarf> Es0teric: https://gist.github.com/3031719
[00:42:43] <gnarf> Es0teric: sorry no demo
[00:42:48] <gnarf> Es0teric: but hopefully code helps
[00:42:59] <gnarf> i dunno why i had .css() in there
[00:43:04] <Es0teric> thanks, gnarf
[00:43:05] <gnarf> but it was prolly to solve some bug
[00:43:08] <jarco> blackspotwiggins: when i read the explanation on the jquery page it seems to go in the other direction
[00:43:34] <jarco> to avoid hitting the parents. I need to avoid hitting the childs. (or did i read that wrong?)
[00:43:49] <gnarf> maybe it was cuz i was using fadeout
[00:43:58] <gnarf> but you could actually remove the animation bits
[00:44:03] <gnarf> and just have it add/remove classes
[00:44:04] <blackspotwiggins> jarco, events bubble up
[00:44:05] <systemfault> jarco: Why do you beat your child? :(
[00:44:06] <blackspotwiggins> not down
[00:44:09] <gnarf> and let css3 do the work
[00:44:22] <gnarf> blackspotwiggins: ++
[00:44:23] <blackspotwiggins> so if you stop it from bubbling at first li, it will never reach any of the parent nodes
[00:44:37] <jarco> yes i see
[00:44:58] <xec> jarco: what does your selector look like?
[00:45:07] <jarco> but I have the other effect. When you do css to ul li, it will also apply to ul li ul li. I need to prevent that.
[00:45:22] <Es0teric> gnarf so thats a functional slider?
[00:45:31] <gnarf> jarco: cache your selectors
[00:45:39] <jarco> ?
[00:45:50] <gnarf> Es0teric: yeah - with the css that went with it, lemme dig it out
[00:45:53] <jarco> what do you mean by that?
[00:45:58] <gnarf> jarco: show some code - I'll show you what i mean
[00:45:59] <blackspotwiggins> jarco, set a class on the first ul, then go use .classname > li
[00:46:01] <gnarf> jsfiddle.com
[00:46:09] <blackspotwiggins> .net surely?
[00:46:15] <gnarf> thanks
[00:46:17] <gnarf> no bot-t
[00:46:24] <jarco> i ll make a fiddle
[00:46:35] <xec> jarco: i'm thinking maybe your selector is the problem, if you do $('li').click(...) it's going to fire on all li's. do something like blackspotwiggins suggested to prevent that
[00:48:51] <jarco> http://jsfiddle.net/y5z3P/
[00:48:53] <Es0teric> gnarf i thought you was going to get a css only slideshow..
[00:49:25] <jarco> i only need to apply a click event to randomtext but not on randomtext 2
[00:49:40] <xec> jarco: what is this markup inside of?
[00:50:02] <xec> jarco: in your example there you could do $('body > ul > li') for instance...
[00:50:08] <gnarf> Es0teric: updated
[00:50:11] <xec> jarco: os put a class on the toplevel UL
[00:50:15] <xec> jarco: or*
[00:51:07] <systemfault> jarco: If you don't give any semantic to your markup… it becomes difficult to style and to use JS on it.
[00:51:22] <jarco> yes i see. (i am working from cms output here)
[00:51:47] <jarco> the html isnt even valid so i am also fixing that :p
[00:51:50] <systemfault> CMS output are usually very bad in that aspect :P
[00:52:11] <jarco> indeed.
[00:52:39] <jarco> but when i use the selector xec game me (body>ul>li) the selector still applys to all li
[00:52:40] <Es0teric> gnarf whats the difference?
[00:53:16] <xec> jarco: you still need to prevent bubbling from its descendants, maybe something like this (slightly crude): http://jsfiddle.net/y5z3P/4/
[00:54:20] <jarco> so it does work both ways to stop thge propagation?
[00:54:21] <gnarf> Es0teric: removed the jquery animations
[00:54:29] <jarco> if i understand this correctly
[00:54:33] <gnarf> at this point
[00:54:37] <Es0teric> gnarf the animations didnt work from the start
[00:54:37] <Es0teric> lol
[00:54:38] <gnarf> you need to make the css
[00:54:48] <gnarf> tie in the html
[00:54:49] <gnarf> etc
[00:55:14] <xec> jarco: propagation goes up the dom tree
[00:55:18] <gnarf> the css just to start with could be as simple as display: none; by default and block when .shown
[00:55:19] <jarco> ah now i see. u did call the children
[00:55:43] <xec> jarco: yes, children() in this case is anything underneath the <li>'s you wanted
[00:56:55] <jarco> ok ill try to see if i understand this (i am new to jquery/js)
[00:57:14] <Es0teric> gnarf eh.. thats alot of work just for a two image slider man..
[00:57:16] <xec> jarco: so if you have something like <li>lol <b>bold text</b></li> you won't be able to click on the "bold text" part, for instance, so you need to tailor this to suit your needs
[00:57:46] <gnarf> well - it was a 10 image slider
[00:57:54] <gnarf> Es0teric: i didn't say i was gonna write it for you
[00:57:56] <gnarf> Es0teric: :)
[00:58:01] <jarco> what you do is you give the children another click event,so the one that was there from your alert doesnt work on it. That event you then limiy to not go up the dom tree.
[00:58:16] <xec> jarco: correct
[00:58:31] <Es0teric> gnarf yeah i know lol... but i am saying, for me to continue it just for two images is rediculous... i am going to have to opt out for something alot simply
[00:58:33] <jarco> awesome. I actually understood what you said :p
[00:58:34] <Es0teric> *simpler
[00:58:47] <gnarf> Es0teric: toggle?
[00:58:52] <gnarf> if one starts out shown
[00:58:54] * xec high fives jarco
[00:58:55] <gnarf> and the other hidden
[00:59:00] <gnarf> .fadeToggle() on both of them
[00:59:03] <gnarf> will swap em
[00:59:27] <gnarf> so would .toggleClass( "shown" );
[00:59:36] <jarco> Thanks for the help people. I ll try to work with this now :)
[00:59:43] <gnarf> absolute position them in your ul container
[00:59:47] <Es0teric> gnarf yeah i could do that wrapped in a setInterval() right?
[01:00:01] <gnarf> Es0teric: setInterval is not the best way
[01:00:07] <gnarf> but it would work
[01:00:30] <xec> jarco: you can limit the .children("ul") so you only get nested lists, might be an improvement, depending on what you want
[01:01:20] <gnarf> Es0teric: noticed i just used a setTimeout loop
[01:01:29] <gnarf> Es0teric: rather than a setInterval
[01:01:41] <gnarf> that way if something for some reason errors, it doesn't keep trying to error
[01:01:55] <jarco> xec: that will help me for sure.
[01:01:57] <Es0teric> ah i see
[01:01:59] <gnarf> but setInterval is fine too
[01:02:08] <gnarf> i just prefer setTimout looped
[01:02:41] <gnarf> brb
[01:13:03] <jianmeng> mmmm
[01:13:04] <jianmeng> :Q
[01:23:55] <jarco> is it possible to animate everything that happens in a function of do you need to do that for every change separate? I am changing colors and background colors
[01:32:16] <seutje> ?step @ jarco
[01:33:00] <seutje> jarco: http://api.jquery.com/animate/ read the bit on "Step function"
[01:36:28] <xec> jarco: could you rephrase? explain what exactly what you're trying to do?
[01:37:17] <jarco> I see what i tried to do is impossible.
[01:37:52] <jarco> I have a funtion that changes colors and background colors of several elements. I xwanted to do one animate on them all that would apply to all. But it doesn't seem to work
[01:38:22] <xec> you can animate multiple properties at the same time, if that's what you're asking?
[01:38:31] <systemfault> jarco: animate is async.. calling them one after the one will work.
[01:38:35] <jarco> no, i knew that :)
[01:38:49] <jarco> systemfault: thanks
[01:41:26] <jarco> Is there a mistake in here? It seems perfectly ok to me bt it will not do what i ask. 			$(this).stop().animate({'background-color':'#000','color':'#fff'},500);
[01:42:59] <IfSixWasNine> hello kind folks, little question about sortable() and "toArray" by default it returns me the IDs from the list-elements, can i change that behavior so i get the attribute "data-xyz" returned?
[01:50:38] <Rovanion> I have the wierdest bug where I can animate top: '+=1.5em' and 2em, but not 1.8em. If I enter 1.8em it goes in the negative direction.
[01:52:33] <xec> Rovanion: could you make a small testcase?
[01:53:31] <Rovanion> xec: I'm trying to duplicate it outside of my application. But I'm having issues. Must be some obscure bug I've hit.
[01:54:19] <g2musicgroup> for some reason my options aren't populating in my drop down menu. // Create select field element and populate with options.
[01:54:19] <g2musicgroup>     var gpaRanges = ["--Choose Your GPA--", "A: 4.0 - 3.5", "B: 3.4 - 2.5", "C: 2.4 - 1.5", "D: 1.4 - 1.0", "F: 0.9 - 0.0"];
[01:54:21] <g2musicgroup>     function groups (id, gpaRanges){
[01:54:22] <g2musicgroup>         $('#gpa').append('<select id="'+id+'"></select>');
[01:54:24] <g2musicgroup>         for(var i = 0, j = gpaRanges.length; i < j;i++)
[01:54:25] <g2musicgroup>         {
[01:54:26] <g2musicgroup>             $('#gpa'+id).append('<option value="'+gpaRanges[i]+'">'+gpaRanges[i]+'</option');
[01:54:27] <g2musicgroup>         }
[01:54:28] <g2musicgroup>     } //any ideas?
[01:54:50] <Rovanion> g2musicgroup: PASTEBIN!
[01:55:37] <g2musicgroup> Rovanion: what does paste bin mean?
[01:55:57] <systemfault> g2musicgroup: Missing a space between #gpa and the id
[01:56:14] <Rovanion> g2musicgroup: It means: Don't paste your code right into the channel. Do it in a pastebin and then link it in the chat.
[01:56:36] <Rovanion> g2musicgroup: pastebin.com jsfiddle.net
[01:56:39] <blackspotwiggins> g2musicgroup, a better practice would be to create the select into a variable, append all options to that and only do one append to dom
[01:56:54] <blackspotwiggins> instead of reselecting it from dom
[01:56:59] <g2musicgroup> Rovanion: sorry new user
[01:57:01] <blackspotwiggins> and doing n+1 dom inserts
[01:57:52] <systemfault> Indeed..
[01:58:30] <g2musicgroup> thanks systemfault  and blackspotwiggins
[02:03:10] <Rovanion> xec: I got it here: http://jsfiddle.net/e6QD2/
[02:03:42] <Rovanion> xec: If you change the value to 1.5em and then press the save button the top div will slide down
[02:04:43] <xec> Rovanion: same thing happens with 1.8em? only it goes slightly further?
[02:05:23] <Rovanion> xec: For me nothing happens at 1.8em, will test in another browser
[02:05:31] <xec> using firefox here
[02:05:54] <xec> but yes, in chrome it doesn't appear. that's odd
[02:06:06] <Rovanion> And if you change it to 1.5em it does?
[02:06:17] <xec> indeed
[02:06:47] <rabbi1> I am trying to make a certain tab selected on particular condition on load. How to achieve this ?
[02:06:59] <xec> but it's -100em in the css so i don't see why it would appear at all really
[02:07:34] <Rovanion> xec: It's 100em high and is in a fixed position -100em from the top.
[02:08:02] <Rovanion> xec: So the bottom of the div just touches the top of the page.
[02:08:11] <xec> ah i see
[02:09:09] <xec> Rovanion: looks like it's adding to the negative value, as in going upwards, for some reason
[02:09:31] <Rovanion> xec: Exactly, it does subtraction instead of addition for some reason
[02:13:24] <rabbi1> or can i get the ui.index of value outside of $('.tabs').tabs({}); ?
[02:13:34] <xec> Rovanion: works fine in firefox, or if you don't start with a negative top value, or if you use pixels in the animation instead, very strange indeed.
[02:14:02] <Rovanion> xec: I'm writing a bug report about this, some odd chrome/jquery bug
[02:15:51] <xec> Rovanion: it also works with latest dev version
[02:15:59] <Rovanion> xec: If you look at this version you can see how strangely it jumps: http://jsfiddle.net/dg5xW/
[02:16:34] <Rovanion> xec: Yes it does, bug must have been fixed already then.
[02:18:18] <xec> Rovanion: aha, hold on
[02:19:41] <xec> Rovanion: nevermind, thought i was onto something but turned out to be nothing ;)
[02:19:55] <Rovanion> xec: Ahw
[02:23:34] <rabbi1> i am trying to rename the text (name) of a UI tab, say "Add Data" to "Edit Data" how could i do this for all the tabs having "Add" ?
[02:28:50] <g2musicgroup> How does this convert in query? http://pastebin.com/DSkk2nNk
[02:29:09] <ntry1> Is there a way to make a screenshot of a section in a webpage with js?
[02:29:22] <systemfault> g2musicgroup: Do you know CSS?
[02:29:29] <g2musicgroup> I do
[02:30:03] <systemfault> Then.. to select nodes, it's always var nodes = $("use a css selector here");
[02:30:21] <systemfault> g2musicgroup: var forms = $('form');
[02:31:33] <rabbi1> systemfault: any light on this ? i am trying to rename the text (name) of a UI tab, say "Add Data" to "Edit Data" how could i do this for all the tabs having "Add" ?
[02:32:15] <g2musicgroup> systemfault: oh ok for some reason I was finding to use .get(); to grab the tag name
[02:32:40] <systemfault> g2musicgroup: .get() returns the DOM nodes.
[02:33:17] <g2musicgroup> systemfault: gotcha
[02:45:58] <rabbi1> http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/3RpC8/98/ in this all "Add" should be replaced with "Edit" .. how can i get all the elements <a> together and find the first word "Add" ?
[03:05:33] <chilversc_> I'm confused, I thought deferred was supposed to follow the promise spec?
[03:09:14] <wwwicked> Good morning all. I've a question about .text(); http://api.jquery.com/text/ says "The result of the .text() method is a string containing the combined text of all matched elements.", but it appears to preserve elements/markup as well, is that correct?
[03:10:19] <wwwicked> e.g. $noScriptTag.replaceWith($noScriptTag.text()); removes <noscript></noscript>, but leaves the "<img /><h2>...</h2><p>...</p>" that was inside it
[03:11:08] <wwwicked> That's actually the behaviour we want, but seems inconsistent with the API doc
[03:11:18] <tocka> Hey guys, Im using jQuery validate plugin, I want to get the values of checkboxes that were checked,
[03:11:36] <tocka> what im doing now is $('input[name=module]:checked', '#pricingForm').val();
[03:11:43] <tocka> but it doesnt seem to work
[03:13:07] <michelem> hello folks
[03:14:01] <michelem> http://dpaste.de/5fN1L/ <— I'm looking to understand why the block in line #9 does not expand the selected element. Any help?
[03:14:35] <chilversc_> wwwicked: I get that behaviour with a div, but I see the same behaviour when using a noscript element
[03:15:10] <wwwicked> With a <div> you just get the text, but with <noscript> you get the HTML retained?
[03:15:18] <chilversc_> wwwicked: right
[03:15:41] <chilversc_> wwwicked: it would seem noscript is being treated as an unparsed content
[03:15:48] <chilversc_> ie, cdata rather than pcdata
[03:15:49] <wwwicked> Interesting. I guess we shouldn't rely on this behaviour then, as the latter might be updated to be consistent with the API doc
[03:15:55] <michelem> the selector in line 10 correctly picks the (single) desired element. However, hideshow() does not expand it. hideshow() is also triggered on a later element's click. There it works again alright.
[03:16:07] <chilversc_> wwwicked: well that isn't to do with the api, that's to do with the DOM/DTD
[03:16:26] <chilversc_> wwwicked: if an element is declared as CDATA, then the content is plain text
[03:16:50] <wwwicked> Ah, OK. So it's probably reliable. At least in Firefox. For now.
[03:17:38] <chilversc_> wwwicked: well its odd, since it seems in the html spec <noscript> is PCDATA
[03:18:25] <wwwicked> I'm sure it's implemented as that as well, since the markup within the tag is rendered as expected
[03:18:44] <wwwicked> Odd though that the tags get treated as text in this case
[03:20:08] <chilversc_> wwwicked: I think its because of the browser's handling of <noscript> it would appear that when scripts are supported none of the inner content is parsed
[03:20:40] <chilversc_> wwwicked: as demonstraited by having <noscript><div id="foo">testing</div></noscript> then try alert($("#foo").text())
[03:21:01] <chilversc_> wwwicked: not sure if that is browser specific though, or if that follows the spec (not that the 2 are related)
[03:21:05] <computer2000> id like to replace all my form elements with nice looking, fancy and mobile friendly widgets. any plugin for this?
[03:21:21] <wwwicked> That makes some sense, and would explain the behaviour. I do feel icky about depending on it though /o\
[03:21:31] <wwwicked> Thanks for the help, chilversc_
[03:22:06] <chilversc_> wwwicked: why do you care about the content anyway?
[03:23:39] <wwwicked> It's because our "you need Flasha nd Javascript" message is dual role in this particular bit of code, so when the user has JS but not Flash, we're stripping out the <noscript> outer part so that the Flash error still gets shown
[03:24:41] <wwwicked> I do think it would be better done differently, but this quirk was something that just popped out of a code review, so I wanted to try and understand it anyway
[03:25:36] <lenswipe> hey guys
[03:25:38] <lenswipe> anyone around?
[03:26:53] <seutje> ?ask
[03:27:01] <seutje> bot-t? :(
[03:28:33] <michelem> lenswipe: only 789 people
[03:28:41] <lenswipe> kl kl
[03:28:55] <lenswipe> got a problem with my site
[03:29:03] <lenswipe> http://95.146.74.215/portfolio
[03:29:12] <lenswipe> the sidebar on it isnt always as long as it should be
[03:29:13] <seutje> don't we all?
[03:29:25] <lenswipe> im using jquery to assess the length of 2 divs and then set both to the height of the longest one
[03:29:34] <lenswipe> it works on page load (sometimes) but not on refresh
[03:30:11] <lenswipe> anyone know why thats happening?
[03:30:47] <lenswipe> also my blog post pages are massively too long after refresh
[03:31:27] <seutje> lenswipe: what script is trying to do that?
[03:31:44] <lenswipe> seutje, its in an external JS file inside a document.ready - want a pastebin?
[03:32:12] <seutje> ah, functions.js
[03:32:20] <lenswipe> http://pastebin.com/n1cZuR9F
[03:32:41] <seutje> lenswipe: it's prolly coz of the image
[03:32:56] <nmee> Hi guys, I am trying to bind to a click event in a jQuery object not yet inserted into the DOM. The object is inserted in the DOM shortly thereafter, but the click event doesn't seem to fire. Am I doing it wrong?
[03:32:57] <seutje> the height is determined befor the image takes up any space
[03:33:00] <lenswipe> seutje, the image?
[03:33:02] <lenswipe> ah i see
[03:33:11] <seutje> so ideally, you should wait untill images are loaded
[03:33:19] <lenswipe> seutje, is there a way to fix that? also the document.ready would take care of that
[03:33:24] <seutje> normally, u'd use a window.load or something, but .load fucks with cached images
[03:33:29] <seutje> hang on
[03:33:49] <lenswipe> im using document.ready
[03:33:56] <lenswipe> surely that should do it? O_O
[03:33:57] <seutje> lenswipe: http://desandro.github.com/imagesloaded/
[03:34:00] <seutje> ofc not
[03:34:22] <seutje> doc rdy doesn't wait for anything to be loaded, just waits for the DOM to be ready
[03:34:31] <lenswipe> ah right
[03:34:48] <lenswipe> how do i use that?
[03:34:56] <lenswipe> just link to it in <head> ?
[03:35:43] <seutje> lenswipe: I suggest you download it
[03:36:07] <lenswipe> i am doing
[03:36:11] <lenswipe> but i still have to link to it
[03:36:19] <seutje> oh sure
[03:36:28] <seutje> like any other javascript, preferably at the bottom
[03:37:17] <seutje> then you can pretty much copy over the example, omit all the width junk and just do ur height calculations in the handler
[03:37:21] <seutje> or callback even
[03:38:07] <havocologe> if i use something like: test = $.post(url). How can be sure to not access test, until it is finally loaded/the request finished ?
[03:38:07] <seutje> note that this will probably result in a visible "jerk" when the images are all loaded
[03:38:19] <lenswipe> seutje, its not working ;_;
[03:38:20] <lenswipe> $.imagesLoaded(function( $images, $proper, $broken ){
[03:38:20] <lenswipe>         setMaxHeight('.splitblock');
[03:38:20] <lenswipe>     });
[03:38:39] <seutje> erm
[03:38:47] <seutje> that's not at all what the example shows
[03:39:12] <seutje> it shows the method being called on an object, most likely a jQuery element collection
[03:39:25] <computer2000> can anyone recommend me some plugin to make my forms fancier and more touch friendly? pls no jquery-mobile, thats wy to much for what i need
[03:39:57] <lenswipe> i fixed it :)
[03:40:05] <lenswipe> $('body').imagesLoaded() :)
[03:40:11] <seutje> :)
[03:40:25] <tocka> Could someone tell me what am I doing wrong?
[03:40:25] <tocka> window.location.replace("confirm.php?name="+name+"&email="+email+);
[03:40:40] <seutje> computer2000: I've had some fruitful experiences with uniform
[03:40:50] <computer2000> seutje: thx ill check it out
[03:41:10] <seutje> tocka: String.replace takes 2 arguments
[03:41:13] <lenswipe> thank you for your help seutje
[03:41:18] <sanova> hi
[03:41:22] <tocka> thank you
[03:42:30] <seutje> tocka: also, it doesn't mutate the value, it just returns the mutated result, so u'll have to set it yourself, iirc: window.location = window.location.replace('foo', 'bar'); or something
[03:43:47] <computer2000> seutje: uniform looks nice but sadly i need something more touch friendly
[03:43:48] <xec> seutje: window.location isn't a string, is it?
[03:44:14] <xec> seutje: maybe window.location.href.replace(...) ?
[03:45:10] <sanova> why when i drag a div outside panel to drop it in different panel, the other divs into first panel slides on the left ? is this normal drag/drop behavior?
[03:46:02] <seutje>  xec: hm, it isn't, but using replace on it doesn't throw an error
[03:48:02] <xec> seutje: calling replace() directly on location also seems to trigger a refresh, appending the arg to the url
[03:48:38] <seutje> xec: yea, weird, giving it 2 argument just triggers a refresh
[03:48:41] <xec> seutje: a bit odd i reckon
[03:48:55] <seutje> for javascript, this isn't odd at all
[03:49:40] <xec> onyl a bit ^^
[03:49:43] <xec> only*
[03:51:20] <xec> seutje: true: "string lol".replace === window.location.href.replace
[03:51:28] <xec> seutje: false: "string lol".replace === window.location.replace
[03:53:20] <xec> seutje: looks like location has its own replace method, see methods https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.location#Location_object
[03:53:32] <xec> replace(url) 	Replace the current document with the one at the provided URL
[03:53:50] <computer2000> pls help: how can i decouple jquery-mobile's radiobutton widget? i only need this, not the whole suite
[03:56:27] <chilversc_> hm, so jQuery.when doesn't accept an array
[03:56:55] <systemfault> Any javascript function accept an array...
[03:57:01] <systemfault> Think about it...
[03:57:47] <seutje> xec: heh, talk about making shit confusing
[03:57:57] <seutje> let's use the same name, but have it to something wildly different
[03:58:25] <systemfault> chilversc: $.when.apply(null, myDeferredArray) ?
[03:58:33] <xec> seutje: shit is not all that confusing. it is produced by your body and comes from the food you eat
[03:58:41] <xec> seutje: javascript on the other hand, different story
[03:59:37] <Rovanion> xec: heh.
[04:00:01] <chilversc_> systemfault: yeah, I just thought it odd that $.when didn't accept an array
[04:00:14] <chilversc_> systemfault: the doc's don't really make it clear, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[04:00:18] <systemfault> chilversc_: It doesn't.
[04:00:54] <chilversc_> to me that signature looks like a single argument
[04:00:55] <systemfault> chilversc_: But every function in javascript derive from Function… and Function has a apply method so you can pass it an array of arguments
[04:01:01] <NodeX> you can pass it a json object
[04:01:09] <GreekFreak> Hi all.
[04:01:44] <write> When i use $.ajax to reload a division, will it load with css there too inside the division? Which should i use to replace a <div> with html data? $('div').html(); or $('div').load();
[04:01:46] <NodeX> or comma separate your calls
[04:01:56] <systemfault> ?js function add(x, y) { return x + y; } add.apply(null, [2,3]);
[04:02:07] <systemfault> Stupid bot...
[04:02:24] <GreekFreak> I have a modal window, and in that window a fieldset. The fieldset is populated dynamically, and I have a div inside it with overflow: true. The overflow works fine in creating scroll bars, but when I resize the modal window, the fieldset remains at the fized size that I set it. How do I fix that?
[04:02:25] <NodeX> load() does the ajax call for you and has the added benefit of a callback once complete
[04:02:48] <write> Does $.ajax get/loads the css too inside a division?
[04:03:09] <NodeX> your CSS is loaded at page load or w/e so it inherits
[04:03:40] <NodeX> if it's new CSS then include a style block with your content
[04:04:05] <write> You are not reloading the page, you are only changin/load the content of a div,  it's not new css it's the global css for that page
[04:04:20] <chilversc_> systemfault: right, but in this case I'm not sure the documentation is that clear
[04:04:26] <write> Will it inherit? Are you sure/confident?
[04:04:37] <systemfault> chilversc_: That's not jQuery, apply is pure javascript.
[04:04:56] <chilversc_> systemfault: I mean this; jQuery.when( deferreds ) -- deferredsOne or more Deferred objects, or plain JavaScript objects.
[04:05:07] <NodeX> write lol of course i am sure
[04:05:23] <gnagno> hello all
[04:06:42] <gnagno> I have this line of code which is working perfectly on chrome and firefox, but is not working on ie8, can someone please explain me why and how to solve it? $("#select_month").html( $("#months_hidden").html() );
[04:06:50] <xec> write: any css styles applied at page load will also apply to any elements added later via js (unless overridden explicitly)
[04:07:02] <NodeX> gnagno : what is the error ?
[04:07:25] <gnagno> NodeX, the destination div element is empty
[04:07:27] <NodeX> IE7/8 freaks out sometimes when there is no html to add
[04:07:28] <write> xec: NodeX Thank you then.
[04:07:52] <gnagno> but I am sure there's html to add, I am printing it in an alert box
[04:08:03] <systemfault> chilversc_: That function doesn't take an array, it works like this: $.when(deferred1, deferred2, deferredN)
[04:08:11] <write> xec: But that is not just new element, rather loading with ajax, that was the concern
[04:08:30] <NodeX> gnagno : is it wrapped in a document ready ?
[04:08:31] <gnagno> NodeX, the destination div contains something before this line and after the line is being executed it is empty
[04:08:37] <gnagno> NodeX, yes
[04:08:42] <chilversc_> systemfault: right, but I'm not sure those docs makes it particularly clear that an array wouldn't be accepted
[04:08:51] <systemfault> chilversc_: Ahhh indeed
[04:08:58] <NodeX> can you pastebin / jsfiddle the code ?
[04:09:17] <NodeX> chilversc : systemfault is an idiot, don't waste your time with him
[04:09:20] <chilversc_> the docs sounds like an array should work, and thus I was then supprised when it didn't
[04:09:50] <amitprakash> given a form containing a submit button with class .submit_button, what selector should I use to achieve $(form).submit(function() {}) event binding?
[04:09:54] <gnagno> NodeX, here is my code: http://pastebin.com/V5xP7EUm
[04:10:07] <systemfault> chilversc_: as long as JS has a workaround, it's not that bad
[04:10:46] <xec> write: $.ajax() does not create new elements in the DOM by default, surely you're doing something with the content you receive?

[04:12:08] <gnagno> NodeX, I will try now
[04:12:27] <NodeX> also what is "#select_month" ?

[04:13:31] <write> Is this forum active? http://forum.jquery.com/using-jquery , do peoply answer there? can i ask there?
[04:13:36] <NodeX> gnagno : what is the element #select_month
[04:13:41] <gnagno> NodeX, #select_month is a div with id select_month
[04:13:56] <gnagno> sorry, actually select_month is a select element
[04:14:03] <NodeX> what about #months_hidden
[04:14:08] <seutje> write: "last reply by ... 11 minutes ago" I'd say so...
[04:15:25] <gnagno> NodeX, #months_hidden is a div containing my list of option elements
[04:15:38] <NodeX> are they valid html ?
[04:15:50] <NodeX> for example all closed properly etc
[04:17:17] <amitprakash> is there a better way to do this? http://pastebin.com/GGzKqhUP
[04:17:25] <seutje> gnagno: seems to work fine for me http://jsfiddle.net/SzdbE/
[04:17:35] <gnagno> seutje, are you using ie?
[04:17:53] <seutje> gnagno: oh, this only fails on IE?
[04:18:02] <systemfault> amitprakash: Beside adding a class/id to the form itself, no
[04:18:08] <gnagno> seutje, yes... it's working perfeclty on other browsers
[04:18:16] <seutje> makes sense, IE never likes it when you fiddle with form elements during runtime
[04:18:37] <amitprakash> systemfault, hmm so no selector to traverse parents like one traverses children? [ i.e. form>button.auto_submit ]
[04:18:43] <NodeX> plus sometimes IE7/8 moans about html() on hidden elemenrs
[04:18:46] <NodeX> elements*
[04:19:13] <seutje> yea
[04:19:19] <systemfault> amitprakash: Nope
[04:19:32] <seutje> you could try making it visible before trying to access the html value of it
[04:19:50] <seutje> or you could try swapping the wrapper instead of the children
[04:20:06] <seutje> but I suppose that could have unwanted reprecussions
[04:23:48] <Kolorbon> Hello
[04:25:06] <Kolorbon> Does anyone know a good slideshow? (auto-slide, next/prev-buttons, thumbnails) I searched already in google, but found nowhere a good one, which size could be changed.
[04:26:05] <GreekFreak> I would like all the inside elements to grow as the window is resized, and if too small the scroll bars to appear. I've been battling it for a few hours but I'm lost.... http://jsfiddle.net/tscholiadis/puAUF/1/
[04:26:57] <Kolorbon> No one?
[04:29:49] <Drager> I have a littele problem, this wont work: http://jsfiddle.net/JSZND/
[04:29:54] <Drager> little*
[04:33:34] <Cork> Drager: you don't have any element with the class append
[04:35:29] <Kolorbon> Does anyone know a good slideshow? (auto-slide, next/prev-buttons, thumbnails) I searched already in google, but found nowhere a good one, which size could be changed.
[04:36:15] <seutje> cycle automagically resizes, doesn't it?
[04:37:22] <seutje> you could also use the event handlers to do your own magic before and after each transition
[04:38:31] <Drager> Cork: ty
[04:38:46] <Drager> Bad mistake, rly
[04:39:01] <Kolorbon> So, does anyone know a good slideshow?^^
[04:40:02] <seutje> is this text coming out the other end or am I suffering weird, selective packet loss?
[04:42:32] <seutje> Kolorbon: try jquery cycle
[04:43:14] <Kolorbon> I did already, but that's not the one i want.
[04:43:29] <burzum> hi
[04:43:32] <seutje> okay
[04:44:20] <burzum> is there an easy way to slide or crunch an element to 5px height? I dont want it to change to display: none but just modify the size and animate the scale effect.
[04:46:25] <Kolorbon> Coda blah... a.getElementbyId("").style.width ... the same with height.
[04:47:44] <Kolorbon> seutje: The slideshow should look like this http://www.abload.de/image.php?img=img_sliderj5xzx.png
[04:48:40] <amitprakash> given this =  form f, how can I find out second <input> element in this?
[04:52:33] <seutje> Kolorbon: I'd prolly do that with cycle

[05:15:37] <mher> hi, i am trying to implement dropdown button with twitter bootstrap and jquery. can you point me an sample jquery script which shows how to handle button actions?
[05:19:06] <jeffsmykil> Any canvas guys around?  HTML5 seems to be aslepp still
[05:19:24] <jeffsmykil> or ladies, ladies are welcome too
[05:24:00] <tocka> Lets say if I have an input field <input name="asd" id="asd" extension=".jpg" />
[05:24:05] <tocka> how could I get .jpg?
[05:29:38] <seutje> tocka: $('#asd').attr('extension');
[05:29:58] <seutje> or document.getElementById('asd').getAttribute('extension'), I think
[05:30:25] <seutje> or document.querySelector('#asd').getAttribute('extension')
[05:33:38] <tocka> seutje thanks:)
[05:37:04] <pachet> tocka: i recommend using a data- attribute for that, since extension by itself is non-standard
[05:37:10] <pachet> that way you can just fetch it using .data
[05:37:21] <pachet> $('#asd').data('extension')
[05:39:29] <tocka> pachet thank you :)

[05:51:17] <jeffsmykil> there are no layers in canvas right, you either clear the whole canvas or nothing?
[05:52:31] <jeffreylevesque> can someone help me with: http://jsfiddle.net/nwPgJ/11/.  I'm trying to say, if a radio button is selected, show it's immediate siblings; if no radio buttons are selected (among it's siblings), hide all of them
[05:53:05] <pachet> jeffsmykil: well, you can specify the dimensions that you want to clear with clearRect
[05:53:16] <mher> shoky: thanks, it looks like it works for simple buttons not for dropdown
[05:53:31] <jeffsmykil> pachet yeah, just seems very inefficient
[05:53:48] <pachet> relative to?
[05:54:17] <jeffsmykil> good question
[05:54:28] <jeffsmykil> being able to do separate layers i guess
[05:54:33] <jeffsmykil> and only changing what you need changed
[05:54:47] <jeffsmykil> pachet im oporting our real time maps to canvas from flash
[05:54:47] <pachet> even with something like flash, the concept of layers is just an abstraction over a draw context
[05:55:39] <pachet> eg flash tracks the things you've added to the stage for you, and knows how to update those elements individually in a way that creates the illusion of multiple layers / sprites / etc
[05:55:45] <jeffsmykil> pachet whats the advantage of using canvas oevr absolutely positioned elements ontop of a map?
[05:55:58] <pachet> ease of maintenance
[05:56:18] <jeffsmykil> ive done that before
[05:56:21] <jeffsmykil> canvas is all new to me
[05:56:34] <jeffsmykil> i feel like a complete noob
[05:56:38] <jeffsmykil> even more so then usual
[05:56:41] <jeffsmykil> *than
[05:56:51] <pachet> if you're struggling to make the transition from flash -> canvas, there are good reads out there to help bridge the gap
[05:57:02] <pachet> in particular i'd recommend reading up on flash blitting
[05:57:15] <jeffsmykil> nope not a flash guy either lol
[05:57:16] <pachet> since that gets to the heart of updating a context, and it works the same way in canvas
[05:57:19] <pachet> oh i see
[05:57:24] <pachet> well
[05:57:39] <jeffsmykil> ive done this as a proof of concept in standard js
[05:57:48] <jeffsmykil> absolute positioning and the like
[05:57:56] <jeffsmykil> just thought it would be a better thing to do it in canvas
[05:58:17] <jeffsmykil> of course I have to support IE 7 and IE 8 so using any of the super useful canvas libraries is out of the question
[05:58:31] <pachet> sounds poopy
[05:58:58] <jeffsmykil> yeah there are some great libraries that help you do things such as layers
[05:59:22] <jeffsmykil> like http://www.kineticjs.com/
[05:59:28] <jeffsmykil> but that doesnt work with excanvas
[06:03:12] <jeffreylevesque> can someone help me with radio buttons?
[06:03:56] <shoky> jeffreylevesque: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/nwPgJ/13/
[06:04:30] <jeffreylevesque> thanks shoky :)
[06:04:46] <jeffreylevesque> I'm going to google the syntax, but what does 'el' represent?
[06:05:11] <shoky> it's just the name i gave to the parameter for the 'each' callback. short for 'element' :P
[06:05:26] <shoky> could have used 'this' instead of 'el', btw
[06:05:34] <monk13> Do you guys use a plugin to style radio/checkboxes for mobile? I have a relatively simple site so don't want to use something like jquery mobile. I styled them myself based on this article: http://css3wizardry.com/tag/mobile-radio-button/ ... Wasn't sure if some plugin could automatically do it better.
[06:06:00] <shoky> jeffreylevesque so read about .each()
[06:06:09] <chilversc_> how annoying, the mdn pages for local storage don't have the usual method/property list that other object pages have
[06:06:20] <jeffreylevesque> will do, and the variable 'i'?
[06:06:36] <shoky> it's the index, which .each also provides to the callback
[06:06:47] <shoky> but i'm not using it
[06:07:02] <shoky> because using indices is sloppy and bound to fail unless you're super careful :P
[06:10:16] <jarco> Does anyone have a good suggestion for a plugin or a way to sort li items in an ul?
[06:10:41] <jarco> They should be sorten on alphabeth with by the text inside of them
[06:11:56] <xec> jarco: i don't know one, but you can probably make one yourself relatively easily, have a look at https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[06:12:27] <pachet> jeffreylevesque: shoky's fiddle is clearer, but just for fun: http://jsfiddle.net/seCZ2/
[06:13:22] <xec> jarco: also, google found me this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/304396/what-is-the-easiest-way-to-order-a-ul-ol-in-jquery
[06:14:17] <jarco> xec: thanks. Btw your suggestions from before, Awesome! I learned a lot today.

[06:16:46] <skcin7> What's the best way to load content into a div when a user clicks on something?
[06:16:52] <xec> jarco: yw :)
[06:16:56] <seutje> best or easiest?
[06:17:09] <skcin7> both :)
[06:17:15] <xec> pick one! :D
[06:17:20] <skcin7> best
[06:17:39] <xec> take it away, seutje
[06:17:43] * xec hides
[06:17:43] <seutje> easiest: $('.trigger').click(function() { $('.target-div').load('external/content'); });
[06:18:13] <seutje> oh wait
[06:18:19] <Falcon`> he wanted best :|
[06:18:30] <seutje> easiest: $('.trigger').click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $('.target-div').load('external/content'); });
[06:18:47] <xec> lol
[06:19:19] <xec> just in case .trigger is an anchor? :D
[06:19:28] <skcin7> lol, pretty much the same thing as you had before. seems pretty straight forward and easy, so why isn't that the "best" way to do it?
[06:19:45] <pachet> because there's no error callback
[06:20:35] <skcin7> Wouldn't the error callback just be some extra javascript that you add into the .load() part?
[06:20:40] <jeffsmykil> is there a function to tell how rotated an image is in canvas?
[06:20:48] <skcin7> You would still use .load() however, correct?
[06:20:54] <xec> skcin7: the best way is to read the docs on stuff like $.ajax() and .append() to really understand what's going on
[06:21:24] <xec> no, .load() does too much for its own good in my opinion
[06:21:41] <pachet> $.ajax
[06:21:43] <pachet> tried and true!
[06:21:57] <skcin7> $.ajax is what I use now for everything
[06:22:49] <xec> good, then you should be comfortable with receiving the content already, it's just the insert-into-dom you're missing?
[06:23:04] <skcin7> I was mostly asking about the theory.
[06:23:35] <seutje> better: $(document).delegate('.trigger', 'click', handlerName); var handlerName = function(e) { $.ajax('some/url', {success: successHandler, error: errorHandler}) }, successHandler = function(data, status, jqXHR) {doShizzle(); }, errorHandler = function(jqXHR, status, error) { dErrorHandling(); };
[06:24:16] <xec> oneliner. simple. xD
[06:24:21] <r3v3rb> hi, can someone shed some light on this? http://jsfiddle.net/6UbSr/1/
[06:24:28] * skcin7 bows to seutje
[06:24:46] <xec> just need a horizontal scrollwheel on your mouse
[06:24:50] <seutje> replace doShizzle() with the inserting of the data, limiting it to whatever subset you need, and dErrorHandler() with whatever error handling you think is necessary
[06:24:55] <r3v3rb> if you close up the result view to 3 columns in my 'real' page the 5th item doesn't show its grey bar by default
[06:25:22] <r3v3rb> after the hoverIntent its fine
[06:25:32] <seutje> shit, forgot the e.prevenDefault() again
[06:25:38] <seutje> every. motherfucking. time.
[06:25:46] <r3v3rb> unfortunately in the jsfiddle its seems to work perfectly...
[06:25:50] <r3v3rb> lol
[06:25:54] <xec> seutje: i still don't know what you want that for tbh
[06:26:13] <seutje> xec: the preventDefault?
[06:26:16] <xec> yes
[06:26:26] <seutje> usually ppl use a <a href="#">foo</a> for the trigger
[06:26:35] <seutje> prevent the page from jumping to the top
[06:26:43] <seutje> (when it follows the # link)
[06:26:54] <xec> in that case, right. i usually don't ;)
[06:27:16] <seutje> I usually use normal links that provide the same functionality, but with a pageload
[06:27:17] * pachet uses spans for non-redirecting buttons - accessibility be damned
[06:27:23] <seutje> so then I definitely want to preventDefault
[06:27:43] <seutje> but googlebot executes JS now, so I guess I'm just being old
[06:30:12] <seutje> r3v3rb: it prolly won't change anything, but your "height" variable is leaking in the global scope
[06:30:34] <r3v3rb> seutje: okay lemme check :D
[06:30:50] <r3v3rb> maybe its causing the value to not get set correctly...
[06:31:20] <r3v3rb> btw, 'leaking' ?
[06:31:35] <r3v3rb> i thought I had wrapped both usages into their own scope
[06:31:48] <shoky> r3v3rb: the hoverIntent ver you're using is for jquery 1.5.1+ btw
[06:32:01] <r3v3rb> oh shoot!
[06:32:28] <shoky> and by leaking he means you didn't put 'var' in front of it
[06:32:32] <r3v3rb> ok
[06:32:35] <shoky> so it sets window.height probably
[06:32:40] * hlveheart slaps shoky around a bit with a large trout
[06:32:44] * hlveheart hides
[06:32:47] * shoky sits on hlveheart
[06:33:11] <seutje> r3v3rb: it's seemingly defined in a local scope, but is available in the global scope without being defined as window.varname
[06:33:59] <seutje> it's advised to use as little global variables as possible, only expose those that are meaningfull to expose, and try to namespace them to avoid conflicts
[06:34:36] <r3v3rb> seutje: so just var height will still be global?
[06:34:48] <seutje> when defining variables in the global scope from within a local scope, it's usually advised to write it as window.foo = 'bar'; instead of foo = 'bar';, to avoid confusion for the reader
[06:35:13] <seutje> r3v3rb: no, things that are declared with the var statement will only be available in the current function scope
[06:35:17] <r3v3rb> ok, well I need them only locally to each function so just var height
[06:35:37] <seutje> so in this case, they'll only be available in your anonymous function (the one in the each)
[06:35:50] <r3v3rb> yep, thats what i was intending
[06:35:53] <seutje> r3v3rb: yes
[06:36:15] <r3v3rb> however even scoped locally the 5th item in the list gets its height set the same as the 2nd...
[06:36:20] <seutje> as I said, this is prolly unrelated to your problem, just thought it might be interesting to know
[06:36:40] <r3v3rb> it is indeed interesting to know, I want my code to be as clean as poss
[06:38:13] <r3v3rb> 1,2,3,4,6 all drop to the correct position, 5 is positioned to high and doesn't appear in the div - on this page locally
[06:38:22] <r3v3rb> switched to jq1.7.2
[06:38:25] <seutje> r3v3rb: did you try changing to a later jQuery version?
[06:38:27] <seutje> ah
[06:38:28] <r3v3rb> no difference
[06:38:32] <r3v3rb> :)
[06:38:40] <seutje> pretty weird that it workd on the fiddle
[06:38:51] <seutje> must be something else screwing with it
[06:38:52] <r3v3rb> i know, sending me crazy
[06:39:05] * r3v3rb adds more console.logs
[06:39:20] * xec sends out some crazy to r3v3rb
[06:39:23] <seutje> try comparing the computed style of the 5th element and one of the others
[06:39:33] <shoky> i was just typying: put some console.logs
[06:39:34] <shoky> ;]
[06:39:35] <seutje> preferably before jQuery touches it
[06:39:58] <r3v3rb> well, in firebug the height is being set to the same as item 2 in the list in console.log
[06:40:06] <r3v3rb> very weird
[06:40:37] <r3v3rb> and because item 2 has more content this in effect moves the item in 5 to far up before the animate
[06:40:39] <boulet101010> hi everybody
[06:42:19] <r3v3rb> if i fb the element its height is 75px - the each returns 95px in the loop...
[06:44:47] <shoky> fb?
[06:45:10] <seutje> r3v3rb: also, your anonymous function in your each() call is exactly the same as ob_Hide, so might as well $('li.ob_product').each(ob_Hide);
[06:45:15] <seutje> shoky: firebug
[06:46:08] <boulet101010> http://pastebin.com/9gLphRS8
[06:46:27] <shoky> here it looks like indeed the 2nd and 5th are higher than the others
[06:46:27] <boulet101010> how to do line 2 only when loadPage has succeeded?
[06:46:45] <shoky> their height is 100, the others are 80
[06:47:04] <shoky> both in console.log and in dom view
[06:47:15] <shoky> (and if just looking at the elements...)
[06:47:25] <shoky> i.e. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/6UbSr/2/
[06:47:40] <pachet> boulet: look at $.ajax, and the success callback
[06:47:44] <pachet> ?.ajax
[06:47:57] <pachet> mhrm...
[06:48:58] <shoky> boulet101010: loadPage(href).done(function() { $('#editeur').html(Page.contenu) } );
[06:49:07] <boulet101010> that's what i thought
[06:49:17] <boulet101010> but loadPage returns undefined, is it normal?
[06:49:27] <shoky> uhm no
[06:50:01] <boulet101010> it should return a deffered object that's it?
[06:50:06] <seutje> post should return jqXHR, no?
[06:50:09] <shoky> yep
[06:50:28] <boulet101010> but i think maybe it's not possible because there is already a callback on data
[06:50:41] <pachet> :[
[06:51:03] <shoky> no that shouldn't matter
[06:51:12] <shoky> you can add as many done callbacks as you want
[06:51:18] <seutje> boulet101010: the example on the api site shows exactly that
[06:52:09] <seutje> var jqxhr = $.post("example.php", function() { alert('success'); }).success(function() { alert('second success'); });
[06:52:13] <r3v3rb> shoky: fb = firebug :)
[06:52:32] <shoky> r3v3rb yepz
[06:53:42] <crazyzf> hi, can anyone help me? i have a little css-problem, i want that the overflowed content not be visible http://jsfiddle.net/NkRcF/
[06:55:53] <r3v3rb> cleaned and tidied - no difference :(
[06:56:47] <pachet> crazyzf: http://jsfiddle.net/TGJTZ/
[06:57:19] <crazyzf> ahh vertical-align :) thank u very much
[06:57:32] <hlveheart> fyi, vertical align and IE don't get along
[06:57:33] <hlveheart> ;p
[06:57:39] <pachet> actually it's line-height that does the trick
[06:57:47] <pachet> setting it to the inner width of that container
[06:57:49] <shoky> r3v3rb why wouldn't the 5th height be the same as 2nd?
[06:58:01] <r3v3rb> shoky: it shouldnt be!
[06:58:01] <pachet> er.... inner height rather
[06:58:04] * pachet needs coffee
[06:58:04] <crazyzf> yes but than the title change the position
[06:58:19] <shoky> r3v3rb: why not? it looks the same here..
[06:58:47] <r3v3rb> yes, thats my bad - the jsfiddle works perfectly - only locally do i see the problem ;P
[06:58:51] <r3v3rb> lmao
[06:59:04] <r3v3rb> which I know makes it impossible to fix !
[06:59:09] <shoky> ;]
[06:59:19] <r3v3rb> i have a feeling its the CMS causing an issue
[06:59:50] <r3v3rb> if I remove the 5th element ( good film ) then the code works with the 'new' fifth element ( which was 6 )
[07:00:16] <fuchstronaut> they are making a remake of 5th element?
[07:00:24] <r3v3rb> something amiss with the product in the database causing an issue
[07:00:29] <zyltoid> i'm having an issue where I am calling remove on an element via an object, and it's not removing the element from the DOM. i get no errors, either.
[07:00:40] <shoky> they're remaking the remake
[07:00:50] <r3v3rb> talking good films watched John Carter yesterday - its awesome
[07:00:51] <fuchstronaut> zyltoid: did you tried logging if you are really calling remove() on an element?
[07:01:08] <zyltoid> fuchstronaut: yeah, i have confirmed that it does hit the functino
[07:01:12] <shoky> john carter started out nice. then it got lame very quickly
[07:01:25] <shoky> for 12 year olds
[07:01:27] <zyltoid> i tried setting up a similar example in jsfiddle, but the example has no issue :(
[07:01:33] <fuchstronaut> zyltoid: can you give some code sample on jsfiddle?
[07:01:37] <fuchstronaut> ah ok
[07:01:39] <fuchstronaut> lol :)
[07:02:22] <pachet> on what basis are you determining that its still in the dom
[07:02:25] <pachet> still visible on the page?
[07:02:25] <zyltoid> fuchstronaut: here it is, in case it helps. i'm not removing it via a timeout, so i might update the example. http://jsfiddle.net/LGyT7/
[07:03:28] <gabejacobs> Is there anyway to load a page in jquery mobile and then automatically load a dialog (popup), when the page loads?
[07:06:41] <zyltoid> so the example is more like this http://jsfiddle.net/LGyT7/1/
[07:08:14] <zyltoid> even calling remove in console with the element doesn't have an effect
[07:10:07] <pachet> zyltoid: works for me :[
[07:10:28] <zyltoid> pachet: yeah the example works, but not my implementation :p
[07:11:02] <Falcon`> are objects in js passed by value or reference?
[07:11:04] <zyltoid> hmm
[07:11:09] <shoky> Falcon`: reference
[07:11:15] <zyltoid> if i change an attribute (html for ex) on the element, the element doesn't change
[07:11:17] <Falcon`> k..
[07:11:23] <pachet> Falcon`: value-by-reference
[07:11:26] <zyltoid> what does that mean exactly?
[07:11:31] <zyltoid> how would the element reference change?
[07:11:53] <shoky> zyltoid you are targeting the wrong element probably..
[07:12:22] <shoky> maybe one that wasn't in the DOM to begin with ;p
[07:12:22] <zyltoid> shoky: i can call attr('id') on it and i get the right value
[07:12:28] <pachet> Falcon`: lets say you have var foo = { bar : 'zzz' }; if you then pass that object into a function via its pointer ( foo ), you're passing the pointer by reference
[07:12:33] <pachet> i'm sorry
[07:12:33] <shoky> zyltoid that doesn't mean anything
[07:12:34] <pachet> pointer by value
[07:12:59] <pachet> Falcon`: everything is pass by value in javascript. but you just have to remember that you're passing a pointer, not the actual object as it exists on the heap
[07:13:01] <zyltoid> shoky: what do you mean?
[07:13:42] <shoky> zyltoid:  $('<div id="bla"></div>').attr('id')    will get you the "right value". so what?
[07:14:14] <zyltoid> shoky: you should be able to manipulate that element if you hold the reference to it.
[07:14:31] <zyltoid> shoky: and i know i have the elemen treference because the id is correct
[07:14:34] <shoky> zyltoid: and you are able to. but it's probably not in the DOM so you don't see any of the manipulations
[07:14:59] <zyltoid> i see the element in the DOM, though
[07:15:03] <shoky> zyltoid: if you change its attributes and the element doesnt change
[07:15:13] <shoky> then you are changing the wrong element's attributes, obviously
[07:15:28] <shoky> or you have something else fishy going on, donno
[07:15:41] <zyltoid> it's something fishy, and i can't figure it out :*(
[07:19:43] <r3v3rb> shoky: seutje this is what I get if I set the offset to show more than it should: http://imgur.com/nxFQd.png
[07:20:58] <shoky> yeap ;p
[07:21:05] <r3v3rb> the height of the three inset panels are all equal on the bottom row :P
[07:21:29] <r3v3rb> so why does the height-11 create a different value for the middle panel !?!??!
[07:22:23] <r3v3rb> does the height return the height including any padding - afaik it does...
[07:22:40] <r3v3rb> doesn't*
[07:23:17] <r3v3rb> so i shouldn't need to take into account any pads i use to create the pull down tab...
[07:23:44] <seutje> r3v3rb: iono, maybe parseInt the return of the height?
[07:24:08] <r3v3rb> seutje: maybe because its a poxy float at the moment
[07:24:21] <shoky> .height() ?
[07:24:25] <shoky> returns an int
[07:24:46] <seutje> yeah, afaik, but I'm running out of ideas here
[07:25:12] <gellis11> i have a problem with .html not adding the html
[07:25:30] <skh_> Can someone give me a point here: I have a script that calls a function on a particulr DOM element (specifically the datatables plugin).  From another file, I want to utilize some of the available methods on this existing "datatable" (specifically custom filtering function "fnFilter").  How can I do this when it's initialized in another file?
[07:26:21] <skh_> I've tried jsut selecting the same DOM element and applying the method, but it comes back as undefined
[07:26:31] <seutje> skh_: either test to see if it's available, or load it asynchronously and do your things in the callback
[07:26:37] <pachet> gellis11: can you make a test case
[07:27:15] <r3v3rb> ahha
[07:27:38] <r3v3rb> removing the +13 for the offset and they all work correctly - albeit slightly out of position...
[07:27:44] <skh_> doh, I guess I misunderstood it's usage.  When I selected the element in the other file and 'initialized' it again, my thoght was it would try to set it up again.  Seems like it just grabs the existing one.
[07:27:49] <skh_> thanks though, seutje
[07:28:18] <gellis11> pachet: yes here is one http://jsfiddle.net/nJNjG/
[07:28:53] <gellis11> when i click on 'hourly rate not known' checkbox it correctly fills in the hourly rate field, but when i click to flat rate and then back to hourly rate, it doesnt fill it in anymore
[07:30:42] <saedelaere> hi
[07:31:00] <LobsterMan_> hi
[07:31:20] <LobsterMan_> anyone here that can help me with a quick question?
[07:31:28] <saedelaere> is it wise to use the template plugin, it is still beta and development is discontinued
[07:31:29] <saedelaere> http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/
[07:32:50] <LobsterMan_> jQuery.isEmptyObject() is returning false on a returned jquery object (match of selectors that doesn't exist) that is empty. is this normal?
[07:32:51] <mehrdad> can someone plz tell me what's wrong with this code? http://jsfiddle.net/jsqPZ/
[07:33:31] <mehrdad> the images kinda flickr, one image is not shown at all
[07:33:53] <r3v3rb> seutje: i think i may be on to something - it might be because 'typekit' hasn't fully loaded the site font therefore the 'height' isn't correct at the time to the jQuery call...
[07:34:30] <seutje> r3v3rb: oh yeah, that is a definite reason for shit to return the wrong dimensions
[07:34:57] <tocka> Does jquery have sessions like php?
[07:34:59] <mehrdad> that image is shown for like 0.1 sec
[07:34:59] <seutje> r3v3rb: google FOUT and u'll find some techniques to do work after fonts are done loading
[07:35:09] <mehrdad> all others are animated correctly
[07:35:16] <r3v3rb> guess I am going to have to deal with that then… maybe use a default font for the panels...
[07:35:18] <pachet> gellis11: http://jsfiddle.net/hMp4V/
[07:35:19] <tocka> and lets say if I would use them could I retrieve the results with php after?
[07:35:31] <pachet> gellis11: it 'works' now, but i would rethink your approach
[07:35:40] <shoky> LobsterMan_: it refers to empty javascript objects. not empty jquery collections
[07:35:55] <pachet> why are you setting the innerHTML for those containers all over again each time you need to show them?
[07:36:09] <shoky> LobsterMan_: if you want to check if a jqcollection is empty, just check its .length
[07:36:16] <pachet> simply showing/hiding them would work
[07:36:25] <mehrdad> should i show more code?
[07:36:25] <pachet> and then you wouldn't have to worry about rebinding each time
[07:36:39] <gellis11> pachet: i am using client side validation and it requires a class set eg class="require number", so when i was hiding it, it still wanted a number entered so the form wouldnt submit
[07:36:50] <gellis11> so i decided to just set the innerHTML
[07:36:50] <shoky> mehrdad: you should show a working fiddle that demonstrates your issue
[07:37:03] <mehrdad> ok
[07:37:04] <pachet> gellis11: why not just remove the class
[07:37:16] <pachet> gellis11: and then add it back if the parent container is visible
[07:37:38] <gellis11> is there a jquery function for that?
[07:37:53] <pachet> ?.toggleClass()
[07:38:03] <pachet> jeez :[
[07:38:10] <LobsterMan_> shoky: thanks, but $(myObjVar).length always returns true
[07:38:19] <pachet> http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[07:38:20] <gellis11> pachet: thanks, i'll do that :)
[07:38:21] <shoky> LobsterMan_: it retuns a number, not a boolean
[07:38:45] <shoky> also what is myObjVar
[07:39:16] <sonnie> hey, i have a set of divs created by program, with class 'mydiv'. i want to bind each of these div with a mouseover & mouseout event, hoping when mouse is moved over/out each of them, the corresponding div will display some specfic common text. i tried $(".mydiv") but found that i always choose all the divs.
[07:40:52] <shoky> sonnie: $(".mydiv") will select all elements with class 'mydiv'. not all divs
[07:41:21] <GreekFreak> I have a function, and inside that function I call a $.ajax, with a success, that either returns true or false. I am assuming that whatever I return in the success of the ajax function will be returned by the function containing that ajax call. It looks like I'm wrong and I don't know how to correct it
[07:41:35] <r3v3rb> ugh! I feel like such a cluts for that one shoky
[07:41:37] <shoky> sonnie: and inside the event callbacks you can use $(this) to get a jquery object of the current element
[07:41:38] <LobsterMan_> shaky thanks! $(myObjVar).length > 0 works!
[07:41:57] <sonnie> OK shoky
[07:41:58] <wpsmith> Anyone know why accordion ui does a height that is generally too high (ex., http://mthorebumc.net/missions/home/international/)?
[07:42:15] <wpsmith> http://mthorebumc.net/missions/home/international/
[07:42:21] <r3v3rb> it was typekit being slow to load and screwing the font-size / line-heights on objects
[07:42:32] <LobsterMan_> but shouldn't 0 be that same as true for an if statement? the example here http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_test_whether_an_element_exists.3F uses my pref code
[07:42:44] <shoky> r3v3rb that's not too bad, most mistakes you see here are .. clutsier :P
[07:42:51] <r3v3rb> :P
[07:43:03] <r3v3rb> dont worry I'll be back !
[07:43:09] <shoky> ;DZ
[07:43:16] <wpsmith> nevermind I see why
[07:43:52] <shoky> LobsterMan_: yeah  if ( $(someSelector).length )  {  }   should work the same as if you add > 0
[07:44:36] <r3v3rb> btw, if you get a chance try these http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/asteroid-2012/id443832467 or this https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mspacemedia.asteroid2012 depending on your phone/tablet preference :D
[07:44:59] <GreekFreak> What does $.ajax return?
[07:45:04] <shoky> my preference is an old cellphone, or a desktop pc :)
[07:45:25] <shoky> fuck smartphones
[07:45:45] <shoky> GreekFreak: a jqXHR object
[07:46:10] <NodeX> an object
[07:46:20] <NodeX> all jquery functions return the jquery object
[07:46:20] <GreekFreak> shoky, Is there a way to return whatever I return from it's success part?
[07:46:37] <NodeX> the "a" in ajax stands for asynchronous
[07:46:39] <shoky> ^^
[07:46:44] <NodeX> meaning it will fire and forget
[07:46:48] <shoky> GreekFreak: no, you are thinking about it wrong
[07:46:50] <GreekFreak> NodeX, tbh I assumed that it returned "true" once it completed
[07:46:57] <GreekFreak> shoky, oh?
[07:46:59] <shoky> GreekFreak: dont return things from the callback. DO things in the callback.
[07:47:14] <jarco> is there a way in jquery to do this effect? I only need the effect to continue to the next column  if a certain height is exceeded. http://makearchitects.com/#/projects/sector/ (i know the link is flash but its the only example i could find of this effect)
[07:47:28] <shoky> GreekFreak:  $.ajax returns immediately
[07:47:31] <NodeX> GreekFreak : no
[07:47:45] <NodeX> it has handlers (success, error etc etc)
[07:47:49] <shoky> GreekFreak: much earlier than the actual request is handled
[07:48:14] <iLogic> Help guys! I'm trying to animate each <li> in a <ul> in a queue, so that it waits for the animation of each to end so it begins the next.. I'm using the self-executing callback function described here: http://paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/ it works.. but i'm trying to declare it as an independent function, so I can go like functionName('ul li'); but I'm getting "Object ul#menu li a has no method 'eq' "
[07:48:18] <kborchers> GreekFreak: start reading these slides here http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide33
[07:48:59] <GreekFreak> shoky, NodeX , ok. I have a submit function, and I have some validations. I have 3 functions that return true or false (i.e. valid). One checks regex and one checks if the element already exists. so when they both retrun false, I preventDefault. How I am I supposed to think of that?
[07:49:33] <GreekFreak> kborchers, thanks
[07:49:37] <mehrdad> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/jsqPZ/
[07:49:53] <NodeX> you preventDefault() first, do your checks then continue
[07:50:02] <shoky> mehrdad: that's the same link you posted earlier
[07:50:04] <mehrdad> couldn't get it to show correctly there :
[07:50:11] <shoky> mehrdad: click Update
[07:50:21] <mehrdad> ah sorry here :http://jsfiddle.net/jsqPZ/1/
[07:50:50] <shoky> mehrdad:  setInterval("slideSwitch()", 3000);
[07:50:55] <LobsterMan_> shaky if(!$(someSelector).length) didn't work though
[07:50:56] <GreekFreak> NodeX, how do I continue? when I did what you just suggested, I "resubmitted" and naturally I landed in an infinite loop
[07:51:00] <mehrdad> the images are shown stacked on my system
[07:51:08] <mehrdad> not sure why is it looking like that there
[07:51:12] <NodeX> you have to submit an ajax request
[07:51:22] <shoky> mehrdad: first of all change that to setInterval( slideSwitch, 3000 )
[07:51:25] <NodeX> or perhaps populate a hidden form and submit that
[07:51:39] <mehrdad> ok
[07:52:26] <tocka> Is it possible to pass an array in a url as variable?
[07:52:57] <mehrdad> ah damn, got the goof in the src shoky
[07:53:28] <GreekFreak> NodeX, cannot "unprevent" the prevent I performed?
[07:53:34] <NodeX> nope
[07:53:43] <zyltoid> so it turns out that it's the difference between new function() and Object {}
[07:53:46] <zyltoid> wtf
[07:53:58] <NodeX> I suppose you could set a vaiable as true and check it on re-submit
[07:53:58] <shoky> ?
[07:55:08] <GreekFreak> NodeX, my problem lies in that I have a modal window. When I click the window's "OK" button, everything works fine. But if the user hits the enter key after filling in the form, then it submits the form without the validations.
[07:55:23] <GreekFreak> NodeX, maybe you could suggest a better way to work around that?
[07:55:40] <mehrdad> shoky: here, updated again http://jsfiddle.net/jsqPZ/3/
[07:55:57] <gellis11> can you use toggleClass without any parameters?
[07:56:04] <NodeX> GreekFreak : please pastebin your code
[07:56:34] <shoky> mehrdad: i said slideSwitch, not "slideSwitch"
[07:56:47] <shoky> mehrdad: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/jsqPZ/5/
[07:56:51] <mehrdad> no quotations at all?
[07:56:54] <shoky> none
[07:57:08] <shoky> you want to pass a function reference, not a string
[07:57:16] <shoky> (always)
[07:57:37] <mehrdad> but it worked in my browser
[07:57:48] <shoky> and it didnt work in the fiddle
[07:57:53] <shoky> now you see why not to use strings, yes?
[07:58:01] <mehrdad> ok, changed :)
[07:58:04] <shoky> yey
[07:58:05] <GreekFreak> NodeX, here you go https://gist.github.com/3033652
[07:59:14] <mehrdad> shoky: thx. it seems better now but one image does not animate
[08:02:23] <NodeX> which function is it GreekFreak ?
[08:02:46] <mehrdad> shoky: hey
[08:03:05] <mehrdad> shoky: i don't know why it works differently in my browser than jsfiddle
[08:03:09] <mehrdad> the codes are identical
[08:03:27] <GreekFreak> NodeX, checkNameExists = function(o) {
[08:03:42] <gellis11> what's the best way to dynamically add a value to an input type? would .attr() do this?
[08:03:53] <GreekFreak> NodeX, It should return true or false based on the success of the ajax call
[08:03:55] <mehrdad> except that i have removed the <a> tags
[08:04:03] <mehrdad> which should make no big differenfe
[08:04:05] <NodeX> GreekFreak : as I said the other day, submit MUST be bound
[08:04:07] <mehrdad> difference*
[08:04:20] <NodeX> the way you're treating it is like a returnable function which it is not
[08:04:27] <mehrdad> anyone plz http://jsfiddle.net/jsqPZ/6/
[08:05:42] <NodeX> what you need to do in your case is fire the ajax response and watch the "success" for your output, then check the output or what it needs to be and work from there
[08:05:43] <mehrdad> one of the images' animation is jumpy
[08:06:05] <AB_> How to highlight a set of words in a div(for example) using jqeury?can we use effects for this?
[08:06:23] <GreekFreak> NodeX, In other words make the ajax function call the submit?
[08:06:56] <NodeX> if it passes your sanity checks
[08:07:06] <novochar> https://gist.github.com/eb3a82b3767142beb4f4 line 48 is prepended bFetchingDiv and i try to remove the text in line 112 and replace it with the text in line 120 but what happens is that the text in bFetching is still displayed along with the text in line 120
[08:07:13] <GreekFreak> NodeX, perfect. I never thuought of it like that. Thank you
[08:07:32] <novochar> why isn't the text being removed and replaced?
[08:07:41] <NodeX> sucess : function(data) { if(data.bar=='yes') { continue with your script } else { alert('no Bueno'); }
[08:07:47] <NodeX> success *
[08:08:04] <mehrdad> for gods sake
[08:08:09] <GreekFreak> pun not excused ;)
[08:08:26] <NodeX> you can make your $.ajax synchronous but many people would moan and have you drawn and quatered for that in here
[08:09:09] <novochar> what else can you do if not synchronous?
[08:09:22] <novochar> i was aiming for synchronous js by using queue and dequeue
[08:09:38] <NodeX> I wasn't talking to you novochar
[08:10:52] <GreekFreak> NodeX, lol. Let me make it work for now and I'll fix it later. I'm obviously thinking too much like a OOP developer :P
[08:11:16] <NodeX> it's a little weird because jquery always returns a chain
[08:11:24] <NodeX> except ajax is fire and forget
[08:11:35] <NodeX> it goes against jquery's general way of working
[08:11:49] <NodeX> that's why you got confused I would say
[08:11:54] <GreekFreak> NodeX, it took me a while to realise that somehting wonky was going on there
[08:11:56] <sacho> and then comes deferred.
[08:12:19] <GreekFreak> NodeX, if I noticed it earlier I might have thought of making the success of hte ajax fire the submit earlier :P
[08:12:29] <tocka> What am i missing here?:((
[08:12:30] <tocka> http://jsfiddle.net/bCgMs/
[08:12:32] <tesmar> how do I give a function that is in an object access to a local variable defined earlier?
[08:12:46] <NodeX> I went through a similar thing a few years ago GreekFreak : I ended up writing my own form handler
[08:12:50] <GreekFreak> NodeX, or change a more "general variable" (not global)
[08:13:21] <GreekFreak> NodeX, lol. Looks like I;m heading there myself :P
[08:13:56] <tesmar> n/m
[08:14:00] <NodeX> you're welcome to look at mine if it will help. I dont do the regex or anything client side because i do it serverside anyway so I save some size / headaches there
[08:15:15] <shoky> mehrdad: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/jsqPZ/7/
[08:15:21] <tocka> Guys now im kind of confused, so can I use sessions in jquery like in php or not?O_o
[08:15:25] <GreekFreak> NodeX, true. But if I refresh my app too many times, my guys will complain that they spend more time waiting lol. I'm trying to convince them to move to a web app from an installed competing software. Not an envyous position lol
[08:15:26] <NodeX> no
[08:16:45] <NodeX> GreekFreak : Mine just binds to all forms with a certain classname, then checks for every formfield with a "required" class, if empty halt, else serialize the form and ajax request it to the action of the form, make a response div (if not exists) and load the content into it
[08:16:56] <NodeX> simple as hell, 30 lines or so
[08:17:31] <shoky> mehrdad btw it's safer to use setTimout than setInterval : http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/jsqPZ/11/
[08:18:02] <mehrdad> thank you, so the removeclass was in the wrong place
[08:18:36] <mehrdad> and the addcless
[08:18:36] <shoky> mehrdad i dont know, i fiddled with the css and code a bit till it made sense to me ;p
[08:20:53] <shoky> mehrdad i think the main issue was that you kept the 'last-active' class on all images except the 'active' one
[08:21:08] <shoky> instead of.. just on the last active one
[08:21:33] <mehrdad> yeah, let me see
[08:22:00] <GreekFreak> NodeX, pretty clever. simple and efficient. That way your server deals with all the validations. Do you do any i18n?
[08:23:03] <NodeX> nope
[08:23:34] <NodeX> it doesnt display messages, it highlights required fields
[08:24:09] <NodeX> http://www.nodex.co.uk/ <--- goto the bottom o the page on the right and click "Send enquiry"
[08:24:15] <NodeX> it powers that for an example
[08:24:57] <mehrdad> shoky: i really don't claim to know my way around jquey, but in my code, in the animate callback , the $active.removeClass('active');              and        $active.addClass('last-active'); make sense to me
[08:25:07] <GreekFreak> NodeX, ah. I was trying to see how the i18n-js gem works. gets tricky so I sent it for later. On the other hand, I could send the messages through via ajax :P
[08:25:19] <mehrdad> i mean, on the next item animation, the active item is set to last active
[08:25:33] <GreekFreak> NodeX, ya, nice and simple
[08:25:46] <mehrdad> what is it not clicking with me?
[08:26:00] <NodeX> means you're a little stuck when file uploads but I do different things there anyway
[08:26:49] <shoky> mehrdad: why do you want to add the 'last-active' class to an element, AFTER the animation is already complete?
[08:27:08] <mehrdad> ah...
[08:27:28] <shoky> the last-active class is only important during animation
[08:27:29] <mehrdad> i thought it fires just on animate event
[08:27:37] <shoky> hmm what?
[08:27:45] <shoky> the callback?
[08:27:51] <mehrdad> i mean just when the animate is taking place
[08:27:54] <shoky> it's a 'complete' callback, as the docs say
[08:27:56] <shoky> when animation is complete.
[08:28:13] <shoky> complete: A function to call once the animation is complete.
[08:28:17] <shoky> ;p
[08:28:43] <mehrdad> ok, i'm coming from asp.net and its event system and all , it kind of confused me
[08:28:52] <shoky> oks, just read the docs ;P
[08:29:10] <shoky> i'm sure that works the same in asp.net :P
[08:29:32] <shoky> (reading the docs, that is)
[08:30:23] <mehrdad> yeah, actually i was going pretty deeep in jq months back but there was a gap and it all went out of my head :p
[08:31:15] <mehrdad> yeah in asp.net there are usually two event handlers, one that happens during the event and one that is called after the event
[08:31:41] <mehrdad> thx anyway :)
[08:53:40] <mehrdad> shoky: could be done this way too : http://jsfiddle.net/jsqPZ/21/
[08:53:57] <mehrdad> yeah. i'm still fiddling :p
[08:57:02] <bakers> I want to move an element around in the DOM tree. If I select it, and then do insertBefore it looks like it clones the element and then inserts it?
[09:00:05] <bakers> What's the best way to move an element from point a to point b
[09:01:16] <bakers> Something really simple like this http://pastebin.com/r6HmQbua
[09:07:46] <WebDragon> bakers: .detach()
[09:15:53] <bakers> WebDragon: Detach before I do the insertBefore?
[09:16:51] <WebDragon> http://jqapi.com/#p=detach
[09:17:08] <tocka> Why cant I post an array? http://pastebin.com/457rDXwT arrays are nonModuleArray and moduleArray
[09:18:30] <lancealtar> tocka: have you tried changing "non_modules" to "non_modules[]"? Also, be sure to encapsulate that in quotes.
[09:19:13] <tocka> thanks
[09:19:19] <tocka> lets try :)
[09:20:28] <tocka> lancealtar when I add [] to the end of the array I cant do anything at all then
[09:20:33] <tocka> It craches or something
[09:20:39] <tocka> an I get no error
[09:20:41] <tocka> as for quotes
[09:20:42] <lancealtar> tocka: post what you changed
[09:21:03] <tocka> basicaly I just added [] and the end of the name of the array
[09:21:04] <tocka> so
[09:21:08] <tocka> => modules: moduleArray[]
[09:21:17] <lancealtar> tocka: on line 15 of your last pastebin, you should have changed non_modules: nonModuleArray, to "non_modules[]": nonModuleArray,
[09:21:40] <sacho> tocka, what are you posting to?
[09:21:48] <sacho> oh, php.
[09:22:00] <lancealtar> tocka: line 16 should be changed from modules: moduleArray to "modules[]": moduleArray
[09:22:20] <sacho> If it's json, this isn't needed.
[09:22:25] <tocka> woops
[09:22:25] <tocka> :D
[09:22:38] <sacho> "modules[]" doesn't really make sense there.
[09:22:55] <lancealtar> sacho: I beg to differ.
[09:22:56] <sacho> php should be decoding the json then getting whatever moduleArray is as a result.
[09:23:15] <sacho> he's not posting form data, he's posting json.
[09:23:53] <tocka> Im so confused why this is not working
[09:24:29] <sacho> oh ok, so actually dataType = json posts form data. :|
[09:24:39] <lancealtar> :-)
[09:24:43] <sacho> that's stupid.
[09:24:50] <sacho> Is there even a dataType = json for post?
[09:24:55] <tocka> no
[09:24:56] <tocka> shit
[09:24:56] <sacho> isn't that for the return data?
[09:25:00] <tocka> didint see that even
[09:25:50] <sacho> yeah, dataType is what type you expect returned
[09:26:07] <lancealtar> What response are you getting from the server, tocka?
[09:26:17] <tocka> thats it
[09:26:18] <tocka> it works
[09:26:22] <tocka> just needed to delete that json
[09:26:25] <tocka> thanks guys <3
[09:39:24] <pirt> hello, I think, I misunderstood the selector in my example because it does not work. can anyone help me out please? :)
[09:39:25] <pirt> http://jsfiddle.net/pS9U3/
[09:40:42] <lancealtar> pirt: http://jsfiddle.net/pS9U3/1/
[09:41:52] <pirt> lancealtar: i know that ;)
[09:42:03] <pirt> lancealtar: but i need it for a rel attrib ;)
[09:43:20] <rabbi1> hi, is this coding correct or can help me to compact it if i am wrong ? http://paste.ubuntu.com/1071584/
[09:46:02] <lancealtar> pirt: your last fiddle is looking for an element with id like "div1 div2 div3", and your code has those separate. With your code, what are you attempting to accomplish? Hiding all three divs that have IDs starting with the word "div"?
[09:46:18] <pirt> lancealtar: you're right. i misunderstood the selector :(
[09:46:47] <pirt> lancealtar: i need to find elements with 1 out of 3 possible rel-values
[09:47:00] <lancealtar> ah
[09:47:09] <mehrdad> how do you get an item in a jquery collection? [ ] ?
[09:47:45] <mehrdad> i searched and nothing relevant came up to my surprise
[09:47:55] <pirt> mehrdad: please specify
[09:48:20] <mehrdad> i want to get an item in the collection returned by next()
[09:48:30] <pirt> .get()
[09:48:33] <Phoenixz> How would I get the text right before the text caret in a HTML textarea using jQuery?
[09:48:38] <pirt> return a javascript element
[09:48:55] <mehrdad> yeah, tried that but...well let me see what i did wrong
[09:49:16] <hlveheart> shoky is a hero among men
[09:49:30] <hlveheart> ...that is all
[09:49:34] <lancealtar> Phoenixz: Can you provide some code to examine?
[09:49:42] <rabbi1> shoky is truely amazin, he helped me a lot
[09:50:07] <hlveheart> he helps everyone, he should be given all the medals
[09:50:17] <mehrdad> count me in as being grateful of him
[09:50:53] <Phoenixz> lancealtar: errr... Not really, I just have a <textarea> with text, and I would like to have the text from the caret position, back to the first space.... so "hello this- is me" where - would be the caret, I would like to have "this"
[09:51:11] <rabbi1> hlveheart: he is missing
[09:52:27] <gwinh_dev> use regular experssion for that Phoenixz
[09:53:24] <shoky> MIA
[09:54:02] <skisulli> there is a post on stack overflow about how to get the cursor position, and from there you should be able to use a regex to get the word. problem is that getting the position is to trivial due to IE having a different api for it than the other browsers
[09:54:06] <skisulli> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2897155/get-caret-position-within-an-text-input-field
[09:54:11] <quiznilo> this is kind of an odd question about attaching the jquery.iframe-post-form after document load... I drew a picture http://ompldr.org/vZWxqbg
[09:54:34] <rabbi1> shoky: cheers !!
[09:54:56] <quiznilo> the sample code attaches the the iframe fine, but how on earth did they add the 'target' attribute to the form?
[09:55:00] <shoky> halu
[09:55:24] <bencahill> I've got li's with img's aligned with inline-block...but selectable doesn't seem to like that with arrow keys. Any ideas why not?
[09:56:00] <rabbi1> shoky: i have done something, can u just suggest on the code ?
[09:56:27] <rabbi1> shoky: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1071584/
[09:57:48] <rabbi1> I think i have done lots only in JS ;)
[09:59:25] <lancealtar> Phoenixz: did you get an answer for your question?
[09:59:28] <shoky> rabbi1 just glancing at it, it looks fine.. except for those booleans.. you're setting them inside callback functions (e.g. validateTab)
[09:59:41] <shoky> rabbi1 but you're checking them even before those callbacks are called
[10:01:05] <rabbi1> shoky: inside validateTab() it checks for field validation, so again error is generated so i want not select the first tab ....
[10:01:05] <shoky> (also if you want it to be more compact you could chain jquery calls.. e.g. $('.error_message').html(inValidMsg).removeClass('errorInactive').addClass('errorActive')
[10:01:30] <shoky> rabbi1: yes but you e.g. isErrPage = true;  inside of validateTab
[10:01:38] <rabbi1> shoky: ooo, this seems great !! will chain it rightaway
[10:01:54] <shoky> but you're checking that isErrPage boolean right after defining the validateTab (but not after its actually called)
[10:02:14] <rabbi1> shoky: i need isErrPage to be true if validation doesn't succeed
[10:02:24] <shoky> for other code that is not shown here?
[10:02:41] <rabbi1> other code ? html ?
[10:02:44] <shoky> because in this code the only time you're checking those booleans is at line 119
[10:02:46] <shoky> no, JS
[10:02:59] <mehrdad> awe fookin some
[10:03:03] <shoky> and line 119 runs before any call to validateTab
[10:03:10] <mehrdad> figured it after 30~ mins !
[10:03:15] <shoky> well actually in this code you're not even calling validateTab :\
[10:03:53] <shoky> so if you want compactness, remove functions that you're not calling :P
[10:04:45] <rabbi1> shoky: validateTab is called under select:  of #tabs
[10:04:52] <shoky> rabbi1: in a comment, yes ;)
[10:05:23] <shoky> but anyway , even if you uncomment that, validateTab will be called much later than line 119 is executed...
[10:05:39] <shoky> so those booleans aren't doing their job
[10:05:39] <rabbi1> shoky: no that will be called. on tab select, i have not using as tha validate.js has some issues validating the form
[10:07:24] <shoky> rabbi1: also on the bottom you have:   width: 'px'
[10:07:26] <shoky> ;p
[10:08:03] <shoky> (it needs to be a number, not a string, anyway..)
[10:09:25] <rabbi1> shoky: o, that's a hack. that's equivalent  to width: auto
[10:09:30] <rabbi1> read somewhere
[10:09:53] <shoky> k
[10:10:24] <shoky> rabbi1: what do you expect the line 'isErrPage = true;'  to do , in validateTab ? what is it good for?
[10:11:07] <shoky> rabbi1: also lines 25-49 could be much more compact..
[10:11:11] <rabbi1> shoky: there are two places where i need to set isErrTab to TRUE, once the validation returns false and second the server returns any error
[10:11:25] <shoky> rabbi1: that's not what i asked
[10:14:18] <rabbi1> shoky: if invalidmsg then the isErrPage should be true there, if not there where can i put it ?
[10:14:34] <shoky> rabbi1: i asked WHY are you setting it to true.
[10:14:50] <shoky> is anybody ever going to read that boolean?
[10:15:21] <shoky> 'it should be true' is not an answer ;>
[10:17:44] <asido> i have a table with input in every td. i want to reorder so doing $("input"+nr).parent("tr").appendTo($("input"+nr).parent("table"));
[10:18:00] <asido> but it's not working unless i do: var p = $("input[name=housing_image"+inputNr+"]").parent().parent().parent();
[10:18:08] <asido>  $("input[name=housing_image"+inputNr+"]").parent().parent().detach().appendTo(p);
[10:18:28] <shoky> $("input"+nr) ??
[10:18:39] <shoky> what do you expect that to do
[10:18:46] <asido> ignore input selector
[10:18:53] <shoky> ignore?
[10:18:56] <asido> the problem is within parent()
[10:19:12] <shoky> probably the parent is the td, not the tr, ne?
[10:19:30] <shoky> and also not the <table> :)
[10:19:41] <shoky> use .closest instead of .parent perhaps.
[10:19:50] <shoky> .parent gets the direct parent
[10:20:19] <asido> ok, closest is working tooo
[10:20:22] <asido> thanks
[10:20:50] <rabbi1> shoky: sorry,if  isErrPage is true then the second tab is selected....so if there are errors in the validateTab then ErrPage is true and then that inturn selects the second tab
[10:21:33] <shoky> rabbi1: remember, line 119 is executed way way way before validateTab is called
[10:21:45] <shoky> rabbi1: and it wont get executed ever again
[10:22:14] <shoky> rabbi1: so setting isErrPage=true inside validateTab is not doing anything
[10:22:46] <shoky> rabbi1: and you are not checking the value of isErrPage anywhere else
[10:22:57] <rabbi1> shoky: hmmm, ok. then how can i get the second tab selected if .error_message has "errorActive" class ?
[10:23:23] <shoky> rabbi1: look at the tabs docs under 'Methods' i assume
[10:23:27] <shoky> probably 'select' method..
[10:24:15] <rabbi1> on select method only validateTab is called ...
[10:24:28] <shoky> ah
[10:24:44] <shoky> then you dont need isErrPage = true in validateTab..
[10:24:47] <shoky> it doesnt do anything
[10:25:18] <shoky> (nor isListPage = false)
[10:25:41] <SkiOne> I am using the query ui plugin to create a modal form and I want to disable the buttons after a click to prevent double clicking how is the best way to do this?
[10:26:29] <rabbi1> shoky: once a validateTab is called, it will display ListTab(first tab) if there are no errors, if there are errors then it will display Add Tab (second tab)...
[10:26:55] <hlveheart> shoky is a hero among men~!
[10:27:19] <shoky> rabbi1: ok... that doesnt mean much to me, and i dont see any of that in your code
[10:29:16] <rabbi1> shoky: ok, will check that out, my major problem is - i have datepickers inside dialog box, the user selects the date (from) & (to) searches for few data (here the server call is made) once that data is displayed inside the dialog, the user is unable to get the datepicker calendar. why is this?
[10:29:50] <shoky> how would i know ;P
[10:31:27] <rabbi1> shoky: :) anyway, thank you, will figure that out....
[10:31:41] <shoky> np
[10:31:59] <shoky> if you want more help i guess you'll need to jsfidle ;p
[10:32:03] <knite> I've replaced a select input box with a select2 hidden input (select2 creates its own select box when using a remote data source and populates your hidden input). this change breaks my form submission. when submitting a form, what does the value of a multiple select box look like? my hidden input's value looks like "9,7", which is a list of correct values.
[10:33:59] <rabbi1> shoky: yeah, i have all this different codes there, but combined to gether not possible, as there are lot server calls made, u can see that with the window.location.href thing ..... :) will surely do it ...... again it's a server call. data comes from database, may not be able to recreate that in jsfiddle...
[10:35:11] <shoky> rabbi1: var myDatabase = {obj1: {prop:'lol'}, obj2: {prop:'lawl'}};   :P
[10:37:00] <rabbi1> shoky: yeah, but that should come on when duration selected. more over. never know this environments... may work differently... actually good to ask help initially. once we start implementing to many things in a project. it becomes tough. so mean time learn as much as we could is better :)
[10:37:53] <asido> show() supposed to be equivalent to css("display","block") right? it does to me css("display","inline-block"). did the rules change?
[10:37:57] <rabbi1> and guess what, the project is in .NET . For my knowledge that's alien...
[10:38:37] <shoky> asido: it's not equivalent to css("display","block")
[10:38:44] <skylamer`> Everything changes , asido
[10:39:18] <asido> i got it
[10:39:50] <shoky> and i am guessing that it never was equivalent to that
[10:39:57] <shoky> because that would be mostly useless
[10:45:30] <thomedy> if anyone is working here i would love to show the progress made on my site
[10:45:44] <thomedy> its still a work in progress but its made some solid movement
[10:50:00] <rabbi1> shoky: bye, take care, have a nice evening/ night :)
[10:52:50] <thin> is this valid json syntax? {'success':'true'}
[10:53:07] <rue> Yes, you need to have an object or an array
[10:53:22] <thin> when given to this line of code it fails: jQuery.parseJSON(data)
[10:53:32] <thin> {'success':'true'} is the content of the data var
[10:53:38] <thin> and I get the error:
[10:53:43] <thin> SyntaxError: JSON.parse: expected property name or '}'
[10:53:43] <skylamer`> u do JSON.stringify
[10:54:03] <thin> no I'm doing jQuery.parseJSON
[10:54:27] <skylamer`> no u first do the sintrigyf
[10:54:30] <thin> oh the {'success':'true'} is being echoed by a php script
[10:54:36] <thin> just hand written {'success':'true'}
[10:54:40] <thin> in an echo
[10:54:55] <thin> jquery does a $.post and the {'success':'true'} is in the response
[10:55:14] <rabbi1> thin: i guess is the json is much longer, some syntax error somewhere.....
[10:55:26] <thin> nope I've hand writtten the json. it's just {'success':'true'}
[10:55:40] <thin> <?php echo "{'success':'true'}"; exit; ?>
[10:55:50] <rue> `Oh, wait, does it need to be "success" ?
[10:56:04] <thin> no, i'm just testing at the moment. could be anything
[10:56:08] <thin> is success a reserved word?
[10:56:20] <rue> I mean double quotes, I forget
[10:56:31] <rue> {"success": "true"}, not 'success'
[10:57:16] <thin> ahhh, you're right
[10:57:20] <rabbi1> rue: should work with single i guess
[10:57:53] <skisulli> are single quotes not part of the json spec? seems odd that they break it
[10:57:56] <rabbi1> rue: does it or doesn't depend on the outer quotes used ? :)
[10:57:57] <thin> web console and firebug were properly interpreting it as json and I could see the json object in the JSON tab of their ajax request readout
[10:58:07] <thin> but when given to that line of jquery it was giving an error
[10:58:20] <rue> I have to say I don’t really know…I usually use double quotes, so I may not just have noticed it
[10:58:42] <rabbi1> thin: what is your outer quote ? single or double ?
[10:58:45] <skisulli> yeah I just ran it in a fiddle and got the same error, then I switched to doubles and it worked
[10:58:54] <thin> Or web console and firebug were _improperly_ interpreting it depending on what the spec says
[10:59:34] <thin> using php's heredoc syntax actually: echo <<<jzznn
[10:59:35] <thin> {"success":"true"}
[10:59:35] <thin> jzznn;
[10:59:44] <thin> so there's no outer quote to worry about
[10:59:47] <rabbi1> I usually use " for html/ php and ' for JS. always .....
[10:59:57] <skisulli> yeah looks like ' is not part of the spec
[11:00:10] <rabbi1> interesting
[11:00:28] <thin> so firebug and webkit console should not have successfully shown me the json
[11:00:32] <redfox> rabbi1: you should always use ' in php
[11:00:36] <skisulli> or at least its not shown as a valid value on the string section of: http://www.json.org/
[11:00:58] <thin> redfox: not opening that can of worms with you today
[11:01:00] <rabbi1> redfox: yeah, should change my habit.... .
[11:01:32] <thin> php's heredoc is great for avoiding all ' and " issues
[11:01:38] <redfox> its just a matter of performance. " gets always parsed for variables.
[11:02:22] <thin> ther's been at least 10 articles over the last 5 years I've read that show there's no significant performance difference between ' and " anymore. There used to be a huge difference. but not anymore
[11:02:34] <rabbi1> can anybody guess who uses ' quote for commenting ?
[11:05:39] <thin> damn sucky web tutorial sites. looked through my history, the first and 3rd site i visited about json syntax had examples mixing single and double quotes
[11:07:13] <redfox> i guess consistency is the most important point in this whole discussion
[11:19:01] <poppiez> hi guys, when I hide a fullscreen iframe on my page and hit cmd+r to refresh the page, it seems the iframe still has focus forcing me to click my page before being able to do cmd+r. any way to avoid this programatically? I tried $(window).focus();
[11:34:27] <KorvinSzanto> there was a github project that just implemented the essential jquery methods
[11:34:31] <KorvinSzanto> I lost the link
[11:34:38] <KorvinSzanto> does anyone know where I can find it?
[11:35:41] <johnkpaul> KorvinSzanto: maybe this? https://github.com/addyosmani/jquery.parts
[11:36:00] <KorvinSzanto> no that wasn't it :(
[11:36:23] <KorvinSzanto> it really implemented only a few things like addClass, css, animate and the selectors IIRC
[11:36:31] <johnkpaul> zepto?
[11:36:38] <johnkpaul> ?g zepto @KorvinSzanto
[11:37:24] <KorvinSzanto> no, much much smaller
[11:37:26] <KorvinSzanto> less than 100 lines
[11:37:30] <KorvinSzanto> single file
[11:37:35] <KorvinSzanto> I'll let you know if I find it again
[11:40:13] <KorvinSzanto> it might have been this https://github.com/cistov/Barebones-jQuery/blob/master/barebones.jquery.js
[11:41:43] <brian_> if I .addClass() a class with a css rule for rotation, can I expect to call .offset() and get the rotated offset right away?
[11:46:41] <zsoc> So if I have two jquery libs loaded, one seems to break the other one. Is they because they alias the global object differently?
[11:49:19] <zsoc> ah, ok, i was reloading another version of jquery after the one lib, sry
[11:55:35] <thin> Is there anyway to have an element fadeOut, change its content, then fade back in without having to string everything though callbacks?
[11:55:56] <thin> does JS have an equivalent to php's sleep()
[11:56:07] <sacho> use deferred
[11:57:50] <fostah> Hey everyone, Is there a way to apply CSS update to a class before the element is added to the DOM? My full question http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11299120/apply-styles-regardless-if-the-element-has-been-added-to-the-dom-with-jquery#comment14866103_11299120
[11:58:34] <fostah> example $(".price").hide();$('body').append('<div class="price">19.00</div>'); // this should be hidden.
[11:59:30] <Hopsy> hey how can I make a thread in jquery?
[11:59:49] <danzik17> fostah: not like that, no.  either create the DOM element and set it's style before appending it, or use normal CSS
[12:00:01] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, you know how you did your prefixed callbacks? Could you implement something similar that allowed you to dynamically redefine the results of any jquery method?  Instead of beforeEvent you could use altMethod() where you pass "define" to define the altnernate result
[12:00:43] <fostah> danzik17: ah ok, the problem is this app is using tmpl() and its loading a new template and loosing the style..im going to try creating a style element with the css and append to head to see if that works
[12:00:44] <danzik17> Hopsy: a thread like process thread?  if so, you don't.  javascript is single threaded ( web workers being an exception ).
[12:00:56] <Hopsy> one of my functions takes 5 sec to finish. While time I want to fetch all key pressures
[12:00:57] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: yes, you could do that
[12:01:05] <johnkpaul> potentially even worse than my idea though ;)
[12:01:42] <Hopsy> the point is, it stopes reacting when it's bussy with that function
[12:01:54] <Whirl3d> sort of like altFind("define", function (sel) {var itm=$(sel); if (itm.length) return undefined; return itm);
[12:02:29] <danzik17> Hopsy: look into performing your expensive operations in chunks using chained setTimeouts
[12:02:34] <Whirl3d> then var items=$altFind(".missing")   would be undefined?
[12:03:00] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, how so?
[12:03:27] <Whirl3d> If there is one thing I am good at it's taking a bad Idea and making it worse. I'll tel you..
[12:03:43] <ElGoorf> hi, im using jqueryUI's datepicker with an alternative field. if there a way to initialise the datepicker field based on the alternate's value?
[12:06:19] <johnkpaul> haha, Whirl3d, it breaks whatever programming law says something about least surprise
[12:06:33] <johnkpaul> my original code didn't change any jquery behavior
[12:06:44] <johnkpaul> it just allowed you to hook into events when jquery behaves normally
[12:08:59] <Whirl3d> right, but mine wouldn't change any jquery code, it would extend be all new methods, just a shortcut to define them
[12:09:28] <Whirl3d> technically, you could use the shortcut to define a result handler in general....
[12:09:30] <johnkpaul> oh, you don't mean that you would change the behavior of existing methods?
[12:09:37] <johnkpaul> then why not juse use jQuery.fn? that's what it's there for
[12:09:56] <johnkpaul> oh, you could definitely write a wrapper for adding to jQuery.fn, that's pretty much what the widget factory is IIRC
[12:11:06] <Whirl3d> See, I want a way to distinguish between methods that return values and methods that are chainable through other jquery methods and new methods that are chainable through deferred chains
[12:12:00] <Whirl3d> I am often writing methods that return deferreds or promises lately and now I have 3 kinds of results I can get from a jquery method...
[12:12:21] <Whirl3d> making it less intuitive for chaining...
[12:12:54] <Whirl3d> a (dare I say hungarian) nomenclature that helped determine the kind of chain-ability would be more intuitive
[12:13:57] <Whirl3d> so, I have altAnimate which returns a promise resolved in the callback of an animate function and I got to thinking.....altMethod could be used to distiguish deferred chanable methods...
[12:14:17] <Whirl3d> *complete callback.
[12:15:03] <Whirl3d> how bad is that in terms of programming ettiquette?
[12:15:23] <raj> is there any way I can retrieve a string from the server and not allow a user to get ahold of that string?
[12:16:22] <catcher> raj, the retrieval is client-side, so if you can get it, so can they.
[12:16:25] <shoky> raj: nope
[12:16:31] <shoky> ;p
[12:16:42] <raj> so then how practical is it to $.post after each keypress?
[12:16:53] <danzik17> not at all.
[12:16:53] <raj> in a textbox
[12:17:18] <raj> ok
[12:17:19] <shoky> post after each keypress, for what?
[12:17:33] <raj> to see if their entered text matches a key
[12:18:05] <Whirl3d> seriously?
[12:18:12] <shoky> well you shouldn't post after EVERY keypress, it should be delayed until the user stops typing
[12:18:19] <shoky> (at least)
[12:18:32] <shoky> im sure there are plugins to help with that.. forgot what its called
[12:18:58] <danzik17> shoky: debounce - ben_alman wrote one, or it's stock in underscore/lodash
[12:19:27] <raj> or I can have a submit button
[12:19:30] <raj> but that's so less cool
[12:19:52] <Whirl3d> what are you trying to accomplish?
[12:19:54] <shoky> ah yeah throttling is the word i was looking for
[12:20:28] <novochar> i'm wanting to call iForms to inject this html onto a page, is this how you do it? https://gist.github.com/613615cacac49836691f
[12:20:44] <raj> have the user enter text that matches a key stored in the db
[12:21:17] <Whirl3d> and presumably if they typed the wrong key, indicate it? Cause that's not a good plan
[12:21:31] <Whirl3d> cause then you can easily hack it
[12:21:37] <shoky> many sign-up forms do it...
[12:21:44] <shoky> the validation is serverside, of course
[12:21:51] <shoky> no hacky
[12:21:54] <Whirl3d> but not per keystroke
[12:22:00] <shoky> almost.
[12:22:12] <Whirl3d> cause then you would just enter a key, if it's an error, try again.
[12:22:18] <shoky> per throttled keystroke, or however you'd call it
[12:22:41] <shoky> well you can always brute-force passwords :P
[12:22:46] <Whirl3d> it would shorten the number of attempts to hack it by several orders of magnitude
[12:23:07] <johnkpaul> sorry Whirl3d, have some stuff to finish at work
[12:23:17] <Whirl3d> no problems,
[12:23:17] <johnkpaul> but I do want to finish thinking through what you're asking
[12:23:18] <raj> ok, so I guess I'll need to have a submit button to care about efficiency?
[12:23:24] <shoky> i suppose. but it's still a widespread feature
[12:23:25] <johnkpaul> and I have had the same issue
[12:23:31] <raj> that's what I thought
[12:23:37] <Whirl3d> right on we'll talk later.
[12:23:38] <johnkpaul> knowing what reutrns a deferred, what is chainable and what returns a primitive is hard to keep all in your head
[12:23:42] <johnkpaul> ok, ttyl
[12:24:14] <shoky> bye jkp
[12:25:04] <Whirl3d> shoky, can you think of an example right off hand? I'd just like to see it action. I see it all the time with the duplicate entry thing
[12:25:17] <shoky> well
[12:25:22] <shoky> now that i think of it,
[12:25:29] <shoky> it's not used for password inputs
[12:25:31] <microhaxo> Guys, i am disabling the submit button on $('form').submit() so that people dont mash the button, but the problem i have is, if there is validation errors on the page, they cant submit again!! How can i check if the submission was a success first?  here is my code: http://paste2.org/p/2064516
[12:25:35] <shoky> just simpler validations
[12:25:42] <shoky> such as 'is the username not taken'
[12:25:51] <shoky> etc.
[12:25:51] <Whirl3d> right...then it's not an issue
[12:26:05] <shoky> so raj, if its a password or smth like that dont do it ;D
[12:26:13] <raj> it's not a password
[12:26:17] <raj> :)
[12:26:24] <shoky> but you dont want the user to know it ;P
[12:26:27] <raj> exactly, like a username
[12:26:33] <novochar> i'm wanting to inject an external html file onto a page, is this how you do it? https://gist.github.com/613615cacac49836691f
[12:27:21] <Whirl3d> you could use a simple encryption method that wouldn't be hack proof but would obscure the general user from knowing/
[12:27:43] <jebaird> novochar try this http://api.jquery.com/load/
[12:28:18] <raj> Whirl3d, are you the general user or the hacker?
[12:28:36] <Whirl3d> depends on what you got to hide.
[12:29:07] <raj> :)
[12:29:21] * shoky reveals raj's privates
[12:29:22] <Whirl3d> microhaxo, you don't have to completely disable the submit button. YOu could handle the submit method on the form without disabling the button
[12:29:38] <microhaxo> so hijack it with ajax call?
[12:29:48] <Whirl3d> before the ajax call.
[12:30:05] <Whirl3d> then validate the form and THEN enable the submit button if valid
[12:30:13] <Whirl3d> or then just submit it
[12:30:14] <raj> >_< now everyone knows
[12:30:34] <Whirl3d> they're so....hairy....
[12:30:41] <Whirl3d> kitteh's
[12:30:47] <shoky> pube.js
[12:31:03] <raj> haha
[12:31:05] <Whirl3d> that's wha tyou named your new kitteh? wow.
[12:31:09] <shoky> ;D
[12:32:21] <shoky> she is still feeding off her mom's pubes
[12:32:31] <shoky> should have her in a week or two
[12:33:18] <Whirl3d> her mom's pube.js's
[12:33:28] <Whirl3d> virtual kittehs ftw
[12:33:56] <shoky> im in ur pubez, coughing a furball
[12:34:15] <shoky> that came out.. somehow.
[12:34:28] <shoky> wat
[12:36:12] <Whirl3d> were you at bronycon in New Jersey the other day. I could've sworn I saw a picture of you...
[12:37:37] <raj> Whirl3d, you're from jersey?
[12:37:45] <shoky> who wat
[12:38:16] <Whirl3d> no, I just got an AP Mobile new update about bronycon and though it went nicely with shoky's new kitten
[12:38:30] <raj> bronycon?
[12:38:38] <raj> !g bronycon
[12:38:44] <raj> ?g bronycon

[12:40:23] <shoky> no idea what you'se talkin about. ill go score some drugs. bbl
[12:40:56] <Whirl3d> <--waiting for my source to show up any minute. LOL
[12:46:18] <bencahill> I doubt that anyone actually answers questions here, but I'll ask anyway...
[12:46:35] <bencahill> Can I .filter() the children of a jQuery object's elements?
[12:47:37] <Whirl3d> bencahill, yes
[12:47:40] <Whirl3d> happy?
[12:47:46] <bencahill> Whirl3d: How?
[12:48:04] <bencahill> Whirl3d: It appears that if I do .filter(), it only reaches the first level
[12:48:24] <Whirl3d> you have to filter the children
[12:48:28] <bencahill> How?
[12:48:32] <Whirl3d> $(elem).children().filter()
[12:48:48] <bencahill> Whirl3d: But then the parent isn't in the object!
[12:48:56] <bencahill> Or am I missing something?
[12:48:59] <Whirl3d> any your point is?
[12:49:03] <Whirl3d> What are you tyring to do?
[12:49:36] <bencahill> Whirl3d: I want to run selectable on only some of the li's in a ul, but it takes the list object (I think)
[12:50:24] <Whirl3d> I'll check selectable but if it sticks to convention, whatever you select to apply the selectable to will be selectable.
[12:50:26] <bencahill> Yeah, it doesn't work on just the li's.
[12:51:17] <bencahill> Whirl3d: $('#imagelist').children().filter(':parent').selectable(); doesn't work, but $('#imagelist').selectable(); does
[12:51:26] <Whirl3d> so if you want the third li to be selectable, $("li").eq(2).selectable();
[12:51:42] <bencahill> WTF?
[12:52:02] <Whirl3d> $("#imagelist") selects an element with id=imagelist
[12:52:04] <KorvinSzanto> is $("li").eq(2) any different than $($("li")[2])?
[12:52:11] <Whirl3d> then children() selects alll the children
[12:52:17] <bencahill> Whirl3d: You obviously have no idea what selectable does, or else I'm crazy (probably both)
[12:52:25] <Whirl3d> then .filter(":parent") says, that are parents.
[12:52:29] <bencahill> Whirl3d: Yes, I understand. It just doesn't work.
[12:52:53] <bencahill> Whirl3d: ':parent' is a selector for elements that aren't empty.
[12:53:06] <Whirl3d> what?
[12:53:13] <bencahill> Whirl3d: ':parent' is a selector for elements that aren't empty.
[12:53:32] <bencahill> http://api.jquery.com/parent-selector/
[12:53:39] <bencahill> Description: Select all elements that are the parent of another element, including text nodes.
[12:53:43] <bencahill> This is the inverse of :empty.
[12:54:20] <Whirl3d> try this: $("#imageList").children().filter(function () {return $(this).children().length>0))});
[12:54:34] <Whirl3d> u-g-l-y
[12:54:37] <bencahill> WTF?
[12:54:45] <bencahill> All I need is :parent
[12:54:53] <bencahill> I just need the ul around those li's
[12:55:13] <Whirl3d> you aren't making any sense. You wan tthe ul or the children
[12:55:24] <bencahill> The ul with some of the children inside it.
[12:55:39] <Whirl3d> did you try the code I gave you?
[12:56:02] <Whirl3d> It selects the children of the ul that have children
[12:56:09] <Whirl3d> so the non-empty children
[12:56:12] <bencahill> Which code? The one that tries to replace :parent and doesn't do what I need?
[12:56:16] <kitikonti> is there a responsive slider plugin, with support of custum thumbnails?
[12:56:21] <Whirl3d> fuck you
[12:56:31] <bencahill> Whirl3d: Yes, that's what :parent is for, correct?
[12:56:49] * bencahill prefers not to re-invent the wheel if completely unnecessary.
[13:00:37] <Whirl3d> I don't see anywhere in the docs that indicate that it is good use of the :parent pseudo selector for selecting non-empty elements
[13:00:52] <Whirl3d> I see it says the inverse of empty,
[13:01:35] <Whirl3d> in fact, .filter(":parent") gives the parent
[13:01:42] <Whirl3d> not those elements that are parents
[13:02:08] <hlveheart> Whirl3d, the answer is: god
[13:02:41] * Whirl3d prefers not to use a damned stick when he needs a wheel
[13:02:59] <hlveheart> lol
[13:10:42] <bencahill> Whirl3d: Um, no, you're wrong. I just tried it. $('li').filter(':parent') returns li's.

[13:11:31] <EyePulp> yo - if I have a hidden element (foo)  and do foo.clone().show();  before foo.appendTo($bar);    it appears the .show() works under FF but is ignored under IE & Chrome.  (all on OSX if it matters).  is this a known inconsistency?
[13:11:31] <Whirl3d> retard
[13:12:15] <EyePulp> e.g. a cloned element needs to be appended to the dom before the .show() works properly under IE & Chrome
[13:12:38] <bencahill> Whirl3d: Um, yes? And?

[13:15:38] <saedelaere> I have a list generated with a table and table rows/columns. I use jquery templates to switch the templates whenever a row is clicked. works, but I don't like tables for layout things. Is it worth to generate a "table" with divs or does jquery provide an even better solution? I thought os using accordion, but I don't think it is made for something like this

[13:30:10] <rodd> MeXTuX: $( '#mySelect option' ).not( ':first' ).remove();
[13:30:18] <MeXTuX> ok
[13:30:19] <Eviltwin> ?.slice @ skisulli
[13:30:28] <MeXTuX> i will try it :)
[13:30:31] <Eviltwin> skisulli: api.jquery.com/slice
[13:30:38] <rodd> guess you could short that to $( '#mySelect option:not(:first)' ).remove()
[13:30:57] <Eviltwin> rodd: Don't use jQuery pseudo selectors when you don't need them
[13:31:12] <Eviltwin> It's much faster to use .slice
[13:31:37] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: what's the deal, last time i checked you weren't such a bombthrower
[13:31:40] <skisulli> oh, sorry read that wrong, when I looked at slice, thought it was grabbing only 1 element if no second option given
[13:31:55] <skisulli> Eviltwin is right slice is faster
[13:32:07] <Eviltwin> skisulli: That's .eq
[13:32:21] <skisulli> yeah, like I said read the doc wrong
[13:33:42] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: Yeah, that does seem out of character
[13:33:49] <iLogic> has anyone ever ventured to change the viewport content tag dynamically using javascript?
[13:34:54] <Eviltwin> iLogic: Looks like a few people have: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3588628/can-i-change-the-viewport-meta-tag-in-mobile-safari-on-the-fly
[13:35:54] <iLogic> Eviltwin: i'm able to change it, but it's not working properly on the ipad though
[13:37:47] <danzik17> Anyone know if jqConf 2012 vids are/will be posted anywhere?
[13:41:16] <skisulli> was it confeaks recording them, or someone else?
[13:41:33] <johnkpaul> confreaks was recording them
[13:49:45] <someprimetime> is jfiddle down?

[13:50:02] <neurochrome> Man, found this SO thread to try and shift the autocomplete widget (jqueryui) and just cannot get it to work.  I can shift the autocomplete AND the input using the jquery css selector, but I just want to move the results themselves.  Anyone had any luck with this?
[13:50:02] <lancealtar> I can access it
[13:50:14] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Not from here
[13:50:22] <someprimetime> hmm weird gonna restart chrome
[13:55:28] <devslash> Has anyone here used jQuery in a greasemonkey script?  What I want to know is if @require will properly load my locally stored jQuery v1.7.2 js file
[13:56:24] <Eviltwin> If it's a CommonJS loader, this might be relevant: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7102
[13:57:04] <devslash> Not sure
[13:58:02] <pawn> how do I not only remove an element from the DOM, but remove all references to it?
[13:58:07] <knite> anyone here using select2?
[13:59:37] <pawn> I have a higher scope variable, $slides. When I do $slides.filter('.active').remove(); it is removed from the DOM, but not from $slides. In other words, $slides.length is the same value before and after the removal.
[14:02:20] <skisulli> you probably have to redo the selection that populates $slides
[14:02:41] <pawn> skisulli: that's an awkward solution though.
[14:02:55] <pawn> Isn't there a removeAndRemoveFromSet() function?
[14:02:58] <nFFF> basically $slides is an array
[14:03:02] <nFFF> you need to splice it
[14:03:15] <nFFF> ?mdn splice
[14:03:44] <nFFF> wait
[14:03:48] <nFFF> no you can just filter it
[14:03:53] <pawn> js> var $container = $("<div><div class='slide'></div><div class='slide'></div><div class='slide'></div></div>"); $slides = $container.find('.slides'); var before = $slides.length; $slides.eq(1).remove(); [before, $slides.length];
[14:03:59] <nFFF> $slides = $splides.filter(...)
[14:04:20] <pawn> Hmm..
[14:04:21] <nFFF> filter should return a new set
[14:04:42] <skisulli> true, so remove then filter
[14:04:51] <pawn> Maybe instead of a higher scoped local, I should just make $slides local for every method call. That way it's always up to date.
[14:05:57] <skisulli> depends on how complex the base selector is for $slides, if its complex then its probably best to re select only when you remove an element
[14:06:44] <shoky> score
[14:07:01] <pawn> I'll reselect when needed I suppose.
[14:07:11] <ajustrun> hey guys, my .ajax success callback is not being fired, rather my error callback is
[14:07:17] <ajustrun> even though my server is returing 200 OK
[14:07:28] <ajustrun> anyone know why that might be?
[14:07:59] <ElGoorf> http://pastebin.com/iSUqRs6f   date(2012,07-1,01) appears in the field as 07/01/2012 when i expect 01/07/2012. after using the datepicker it shows the date i just selected in the right format
[14:08:06] <pawn> It would be nice if .remove() removed from the set too.
[14:08:07] <ElGoorf> so why is the date int he wrong format initially?
[14:08:26] <pawn> or, another function like .delete() which would remove from DOM and delete from set
[14:09:06] <skisulli> pawn: yeah that would be nice
[14:09:28] <pawn> skisulli: feature request! :D
[14:11:13] <shoky> ajustrun: what's the error?
[14:11:15] <neurochrome> is there a way to shift an autocomplete result widget away from the input it is attached to?
[14:11:29] <shoky> ajustrun: what's the dataType? pastebin your code
[14:11:32] <ajustrun> kk
[14:11:37] <ajustrun> gist ok?
[14:11:40] <shoky> sure
[14:11:46] <shoky> what's the error tho ?
[14:11:58] <ajustrun> no error i can see
[14:12:02] <shoky> uhm
[14:12:03] <ajustrun> just the error callback
[14:12:06] <ajustrun> is being fired
[14:12:09] <shoky> if you console.log the parameters of the error callback
[14:12:12] <ajustrun> instead of the success callback
[14:12:13] <shoky> it shows you the error
[14:12:18] <ajustrun> oh, how do i do that?
[14:12:29] <shoky> error: function(a,b,c) { console.log(a,b,c) }
[14:12:30] <shoky> for example
[14:12:36] <ajustrun> oh duh
[14:14:00] <ajustrun> shoky: im super confused, this is what it spit out into the console
[14:14:17] <ajustrun> http://cl.ly/3s1n3g060A283r2l3H2H
[14:14:40] <shoky> did you only console.log one param?
[14:14:44] <shoky> the 3rd is the important one
[14:15:00] <ajustrun> oh yeah sorry
[14:15:35] <shoky> (and dont be confused, that object is just the jqXHR object that is sent as 1st param to the callback, as per the docs)
[14:16:06] <ajustrun> oh i see that makes sense
[14:16:16] <shoky> error(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown)
[14:16:20] <ajustrun> the error im getting is "parsererror" => SyntaxError
[14:16:26] <shoky> yep thought so
[14:16:31] <shoky> your dataType is xml? json?
[14:16:55] <ajustrun> that im returning?
[14:17:05] <ajustrun> it should be just text
[14:17:06] <shoky> gist the code :P
[14:17:21] <ajustrun> im using rails and its render :text => "ok"
[14:17:23] <ajustrun> k will do
[14:18:01] <kold> hello all
[14:18:40] <ajustrun> shoky: heres the gist
[14:18:40] <ajustrun> https://gist.github.com/3035749
[14:19:00] <kold> I'm running into a very basic text replace issue, but I'm drawing a blank on how to solve it.  Here's the code: http://jsfiddle.net/KwgRu/
[14:19:07] <ajustrun> the js calls the action which returns render :text => "OK"
[14:19:09] <ajustrun> oh crap
[14:19:13] <ajustrun> it returns an alert
[14:19:13] <kold> I know it's something obvious just can't see it
[14:19:17] <shoky> waT?
[14:19:26] <shoky> i was gonna say try  dataType: 'text'
[14:19:34] <shoky> in the $.ajax options
[14:19:55] <ajustrun> no i fixed it
[14:20:00] <ajustrun> in that gist
[14:20:07] <ajustrun> on line 32
[14:20:12] <ajustrun> im returning js
[14:20:19] <ajustrun> which is giving the error
[14:20:22] <ajustrun> i should be returning text
[14:20:29] <shoky> oh ;>
[14:20:32] <ajustrun> i guess it cant handle js in the callback?
[14:20:37] <ajustrun> or i need to parse it somehow?
[14:20:39] <lancealtar> kold: "To set or get the text value of input or textarea elements, use the .val() method." http://api.jquery.com/text/
[14:20:45] <imsky> what a cold world
[14:20:47] <shoky> ajustrun hmm what if you put dataType: 'text' ?
[14:20:51] <ajustrun> also what is the dataType thing you mentioned
[14:20:56] <ajustrun> just as a parameter?
[14:20:56] <kold> lancealtar: this isn't a input or textara
[14:21:00] <kold> textarea
[14:21:01] <lancealtar> kold: you're right..
[14:21:05] <shoky> ajustrun: yeah as an option to the $.ajax
[14:21:28] <shoky> e.g..   url: '/stripe', dataType: 'text', data: .....
[14:21:29] <whateverb> Hi, is it possible to slide elements with jquery so that parent elements slide with different speed as their children elements?
[14:21:34] <kold> lancealtar: I'm not sure why it isn't working....this has really stumped me today
[14:21:54] <shoky> ajustrun: it tells jquery that the returned data from the server should be parsed as text, i.e. not parsed :P
[14:22:01] <ajustrun> ahh i see
[14:22:08] <ajustrun> yeah ill try that, itll prob work also
[14:22:13] <shoky> ajustrun: and if you don't specify it, jquery guesses
[14:22:13] <ajustrun> h/o ill let you know
[14:22:16] <shoky> afaik
[14:22:41] <shoky> would also depend on the mimetype your server is returning in the headers
[14:23:17] <ajustrun> shoky:  yup that worked also!
[14:23:22] <shoky> ;]
[14:23:24] <lancealtar> kold: Your selector doesn't seem to be selecting the element.
[14:23:33] <lancealtar> kold: http://jsfiddle.net/KwgRu/4/
[14:23:54] <ajustrun> shoky: thanks so much! really appreciate the help and i learned a bit too!
[14:23:59] <jarr0dsz> hi guys if i have a #results.append how would I totally wipe that contents of results?
[14:24:03] <jarr0dsz> remove doesent seem to work
[14:24:05] <shoky> np ajustrun
[14:24:19] <jarr0dsz> like $('#results').append('<%= j render(@groups) %>');
[14:24:25] <kold> lancealtar: ah, yes....like I said, I knew it was something obvious
[14:24:25] <kold> just needed someone to look over my shoulder
[14:24:26] <jarr0dsz> is there a way to make #results all empty?
[14:24:30] <kold> lancealtar: thx
[14:24:34] <shoky> jarr0dsz:  $('#results').empty()
[14:24:42] <jarr0dsz> ah almost ;p thx
[14:24:44] <jarr0dsz> i try thx
[14:26:23] <ElGoorf>  http://pastebin.com/iSUqRs6f   date(2012,07-1,01) appears in the field as 07/01/2012 when i expect 01/07/2012. after using the datepicker it shows the date i just selected in the right format,  so why is the date in the wrong format initially?
[14:27:10] <kold> lancealtar: not sure why it's not picking up that element as I'm using the attribute selector correctly
[14:32:29] <lancealtar> kold: Me neither, but I'm looking into it.
[14:33:43] <kold> lancealtar: it must be jsfiddle as those selectors work fine in Chrome, Safari, FF console
[14:35:10] <lancealtar> kold: yeah, I think it was because the markup wasn't complete. I just completed the table element and it works, now. http://jsfiddle.net/KwgRu/9/
[14:36:03] <kold> lancealtar: lol, thanks...I've used jsfiddle several times with snippets and hadn't run into anything like this...
[14:36:24] <phishbot> #jqconf was so fun
[14:36:28] <lancealtar> Strange indeed
[14:37:28] <skisulli> phishbot: yeah it was a good conference
[14:37:53] <imsky> MY THUMB HURTS
[14:38:16] <dshap> hey all - does jQuery provide a way to download a file (i.e. get a save-file dialog from your browser) via ajax?  i can't just set window.location=file_src because i'm using a JS framework that monitors the location and it breaks if i do this
[14:38:26] <imsky> NO
[14:40:33] <phishbot> anyone get a playbook at jqconf?
[14:41:03] <phishbot> i downloaded the emulator mid-lecture and was gonna try and throw together a jquery mobile app really quick
[14:41:16] <phishbot> i wasn't sure how much of an app they wanted to see though
[14:54:50] <ZGirl> Hello. If I want to handle an event but want to set "this" to a different context, is there a way I can get the "this" value taht would've been available from the event object? Would that just be event.currentTarget?
[14:55:51] <Whirl3d> ZGirl, do you mean $.proxy?
[14:55:59] <phishbot> ZGirl:  you can use $.proxy, or just use call and apply
[14:56:26] <ZGirl> Yes, I'm using $.proxy, but I still want to access the DOM element that the handler was attached to
[14:56:29] <Whirl3d> I haven't figured out the advantaget to $.proxy...considering I don't think you can pass data with proxy
[15:01:24] <shoky> Whirl3d as opposed to what?
[15:01:58] <shoky> bind isn't available in IE<9
[15:02:41] <shoky> i dont understand smth in $.proxy though:  return fn.apply( context, args.concat( slice.call( arguments ) ) );
[15:02:55] <shoky> args.concat( slice.call( arguments ) )
[15:02:56] <shoky> huh.
[15:03:11] <shoky> when args is just:  args = slice.call( arguments, 2 )
[15:03:27] <LambdaDusk> hi, what is a reliable way to set a dom's element position relative to its parent? trying "offset" or css positions give me very strange results (like <div>s with the same value for 'left' being randomly spread over the x-axis)
[15:05:59] <shoky> ZGirl: yeah most likely event.currentTarget should be fine
[15:06:18] <johnkpaul> shoky: $.proxy does more than Function.prototype.bind
[15:06:25] <johnkpaul> it's overloaded to do extra stuff internal to jquery
[15:07:19] <phishbot> @johnkpaul inspired by your talk to write more unit tests in my daily life :)
[15:07:36] <johnkpaul> phishbot: :D that's great!
[15:07:54] <shoky> johnkpaul: yeah but i dont think that's what whirl was talking about
[15:08:41] <johnkpaul> phishbot: definitely let me know how it goes, I'd love to hear how the process works for you
[15:08:50] <johnkpaul> shoky: oh, I didn't realize there was an original question
[15:09:20] <shoky> johnkpaul: and do you understand the line i pasted from $.proxy ?  why args.concat :\
[15:09:44] <shoky> var args = slice.call( arguments, 2 ),  proxy = function() {  return fn.apply( context, args.concat( slice.call( arguments ) ) ); };
[15:10:32] <shoky> (i'd expect just args)
[15:10:46] <shoky> fn.apply( context, args )
[15:14:00] <johnkpaul> shoky: it's just applying the extra parameters
[15:14:14] <shoky> mm
[15:14:15] <johnkpaul> it's applying the parameters to proxy _and_ the parameters to the proxied function
[15:14:20] <johnkpaul> it's letting you partially apply
[15:14:35] <johnkpaul> you could write $.proxy(func, context, arg1, arg2)(arg3)
[15:14:41] <shoky> Ohhhh it's the arguments of the inner proxy function
[15:14:44] <shoky> got it
[15:14:44] <johnkpaul> yes
[15:14:45] <imsky> i'll apply you
[15:14:48] <shoky> thanx :)
[15:14:48] <imsky> to my foot
[15:14:55] <johnkpaul> shoky: :) no problem
[15:14:58] <systemfault> :P
[15:15:15] <shoky> ;P
[15:15:58] <phishbot> made the switch from TextMate to SublimeText2 today because of all the presenters @ jQueryConf
[15:16:15] <systemfault> textmate is oooolllddd
[15:16:20] <skisulli> I love SublimeText 2
[15:16:50] <systemfault> And the dev have been working for a whole century on version 2… and it's still not out yest
[15:16:54] <skisulli> the vintage mode (vim) is great
[15:16:54] <systemfault> *yet
[15:17:15] <systemfault> skisulli: Yeah, it's good :)
[15:17:47] <phishbot> Yeah TM2 beta is out but it's buggy
[15:17:52] <phishbot> maybe it's an alpha
[15:21:31] <skisulli> the editor the adobe was showing at the conference was pretty cool too. but not really worth using until it supports server side languages like ruby or php. https://github.com/adobe/brackets
[15:22:12] <qom2> noob question a-hoy, if I want to subtract additional 10px from the result, how do I do that? "positionTop = offsetTop - descOffsetTop"
[15:22:28] <shoky> -10
[15:22:30] <shoky> ?
[15:23:13] <qom2> great! I added -10px, and that didn't work
[15:23:14] <qom2> thanks
[15:23:14] <qom2> :)
[15:23:22] <shoky> lol
[15:23:35] <shoky> -10px ain't valid javascript, sir
[15:24:09] <qom2> obviously not, hehe
[15:24:13] <qom2> thanks for the help
[15:24:21] <skisulli> does .css('top', '-10px') work
[15:24:35] <qom2> that should work, yes
[15:24:41] <shoky> not the way you'd expect it to, i think
[15:24:46] <qom2> no, precisely
[15:24:55] <qom2> since I'm doing a equation
[15:24:58] <qom2> an equation
[15:32:45] <dsklfsjdlkj> hi
[15:33:27] <dsklfsjdlkj> is there a way to have all elements attached to the DOM trigger an event
[15:33:36] <imsky> of corase
[15:33:39] <jexmex> so you can do a .find() for something, can you count those as well?
[15:33:40] <imsky> $("*").trigger("event")
[15:33:56] <dsklfsjdlkj> say, any time an img is added in the future
[15:34:10] <dsklfsjdlkj> automatically trigger a function that removes its 'src'
[15:34:13] <dsklfsjdlkj> for preloading
[15:34:30] <imsky> lol
[15:34:33] <imsky> document mutation
[15:34:34] <imsky> a pipe dream
[15:34:37] <phishbot> heh
[15:34:54] <dsklfsjdlkj> in other words, not doable?
[15:35:07] <dsklfsjdlkj> or a bad idea?
[15:35:23] <phishbot> i don't think that's possible
[15:36:05] <dsklfsjdlkj> so ill have to manually do it every time new content is appended?
[15:36:52] <phishbot> how is the content added to the document?
[15:37:03] <dsklfsjdlkj> ajax requests html fragments
[15:37:14] <dsklfsjdlkj> then appended to a container
[15:37:25] <phishbot> you should probably do that somewhere in the callback then
[15:37:52] <dsklfsjdlkj> ye thats not too bad, i was just wondering if i could set up some kind of 'live' event to do it automagically
[15:38:08] <phishbot> yeah, unfortunately not right now
[15:38:12] <phishbot> but
[15:38:22] <phishbot> there is hope with DOM4: http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/domcore/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#mutation-observers
[15:38:27] <phishbot> check out those mutation events
[15:39:07] <dsklfsjdlkj> ok cool, checking it out now, tho i have a feeling it will just rub salt into the wound cause i cant use it yet :P
[15:39:11] <phishbot> lol
[15:39:13] <phishbot> yeah no worries
[15:39:20] <phishbot> gl though
[15:39:21] <scriptor> hi everyone
[15:39:38] <phishbot> hello
[15:39:40] <scriptor> is there a way to pass in several callbacks to be called when a deferred is done(), like through an array?
[15:39:56] <dsklfsjdlkj> thanks for the info phish/imsky
[15:40:03] <imsky> you got it
[15:40:04] <phishbot> np
[15:40:14] <skisulli> in theory you could do it with a global .ajaxComplete and analyze the response, but probably not a great solution
[15:40:15] <skisulli> http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/
[15:40:19] <phishbot> scriptor: .done takes in array of callbacks as well
[15:40:32] <scriptor> argh, can't believe I didn't look for that first
[15:40:40] <phishbot> :)
[15:40:50] <scriptor> thanks!
[15:41:05] <phishbot> np!
[15:42:24] <dsklfsjdlkj> ye cool skisulli, thanks for the tip, i think i might stick to re-checking in the normal callback
[15:44:22] <skisulli> yeah probably the best solution
[15:45:44] <dsklfsjdlkj> nonetheless cheers all for the helpful advice
[15:49:05] <avent> Hi there. I have a webpage with a hidden set of inputs. I use jquery to clone these inputs and change the name of them, to match parts of an array. For example the hidden input with the name title, when cloned the first time would be "title[0]". When I submit the form to php only the initially hidden form is submitted and none of the cloned ones.

[16:02:47] <skisulli> avent: looking at it now
[16:03:09] <systemfault> quantegy: Yes
[16:03:20] <avent> skisulli: Thanks a bunch
[16:03:28] <systemfault> quantegy: You can serialize ajax requests easily with .pipe
[16:03:46] <quantegy> cool thx
[16:04:21] <quantegy> so i can doRequest1().pipe(doRequest2()).done(); ???
[16:05:57] <systemfault> quantegy: I don't think so, I think .pipe only takes a function
[16:06:30] <systemfault> doRequest1().pipe(function(){ return doRequest2() }).done();
[16:06:45] <quantegy> ok sysfault, thx for your help, I'll play around with it some
[16:07:20] <quantegy> ah i see
[16:07:48] <quantegy> a more direct function
[16:08:44] <skisulli> avent: its strange, if i break on form submit and do a $('form').serialize() I get the proper values
[16:10:11] <avent> hm
[16:12:54] <scotdb> Am using DataTables for the first time : I have the table populating from my DB but pagination does not work.   I see the "buttons" have classes of "paginate_disabled_next" and "paginate_disabled_previous".   Any clues ?
[16:18:02] <dekna> hi there, it would be nice, if someone can help me with jquery-ui auto complete. i wanna have a form, which sends 1. a autocomplete request at any input. 2. sends all Form data via post(not just the value of the selected input). -> anyone know a good tutorial for sth. like this?
[16:22:04] <ajustrun> hey guys i think im misunderstanding something fundamental about JQuery
[16:22:10] <ajustrun> if i define a function in the script tags
[16:22:16] <ajustrun> why cant i call that function from the console?
[16:23:41] <ajustrun> shoky: you still around?
[16:23:54] <shoky> ajustrun: just showed up, ye ;p
[16:24:01] <ajustrun> hah cool
[16:24:13] <ajustrun> so yeah im wondering about that
[16:24:19] <ajustrun> i feel like it should be available
[16:24:20] <shoky> in the console you can access the global scope
[16:24:27] <ajustrun> but maybe im misunderstanding somehting about scoping
[16:24:47] <ajustrun> so if i def a function after doc ready
[16:24:53] <ajustrun> thats not in the global scope?
[16:24:57] <shoky> if your script has variables/functions inside of a function, then those variables/functions are local to that function
[16:25:07] <shoky> doc ready is a function
[16:25:10] <ajustrun> ah ha
[16:25:15] <shoky> so anything inside it is local to it
[16:25:19] <ajustrun> balls
[16:25:23] <ajustrun> what is the point of doc ready?
[16:25:25] <shoky> :P
[16:25:26] <ajustrun> well
[16:25:29] <ajustrun> i understand the point
[16:25:34] <ajustrun> im wondering when i dont need it
[16:25:34] <shoky> to make sure its ready :P
[16:25:41] <shoky> when you're nto referencing anything in the DOM
[16:25:43] <ajustrun> i guess when its independent of html element maybe
[16:25:45] <ajustrun> yeah
[16:26:08] <shoky> but if you want (just for debugging purposes)
[16:26:12] <shoky> to have access to smth
[16:26:25] <shoky> you can do :  window.myvar = someLocalvar;
[16:26:45] <shoky> assuming someLocalvar is some object
[16:27:08] <shoky> (if its just a primitive value then you'll just get a copy of the value)
[16:27:21] <shoky> and then you can access myvar in the console
[16:27:31] <shoky> (cause window is the global scope)
[16:28:43] <systemfault> If you add a breakpoint in a function, you can access all its variables from the console
[16:28:51] <shoky> yea and that
[16:29:38] <ajustrun> huh wait im a bit confused
[16:29:41] <shoky> systemfault, doRequest1().pipe(function(){ return doRequest2() }).done();    why not doRequest1().pipe( doRequest2 ).done(...) ?
[16:30:00] <ajustrun> so how would i get access to a local function?
[16:30:08] <ajustrun> lets say it was defined right inside of doc rady
[16:30:15] <systemfault> shoky: Didn't know it worked… I thought .pipe only wanted a function
[16:30:25] <shoky> systemfault: doRequest2 is a function :P
[16:30:34] <Eviltwin> ajustrun: You need to put it in a var that's accessable from outside
[16:30:49] <systemfault> shoky: Ah, you're right :P
[16:30:53] * systemfault hides 
[16:30:58] * shoky joins
[16:31:01] <shoky> hi sup.
[16:31:07] <ajustrun> Eviltwin: could you give me an example?
[16:31:09] <systemfault> :D
[16:32:15] <shoky> ajustrun like i told you before, you could do:  $(document).ready(function() {  function innerfn() { ... };    window.myfunction = innerfn;  });
[16:32:26] <ajustrun> ahh i see
[16:32:59] <Eviltwin> ajustrun: http://jsfiddle.net/3ZFEf/
[16:33:03] <systemfault> ajustrun: Can't you just move the function out of the ready?
[16:33:06] <ajustrun> its telling me innerfn is not defined
[16:33:11] <ajustrun> i could but i dont want to lol
[16:33:11] <shoky> not if it's a closure
[16:33:29] <Eviltwin> There are usecases for not moving it outside
[16:33:37] <Eviltwin> I was under the assumption he had a good reason
[16:33:42] <rns> anyone know why these jqueryui tabs only run slow in Chrome?  Everything is perfect in FF.  http://furious-frost-3365.herokuapp.com/index/
[16:33:45] <Eviltwin> I shouldn't assume such things
[16:33:55] <phishbot> probably to protect the namespace
[16:33:56] <shoky> sure you should ;p
[16:34:06] <ajustrun> yeah im a noob lol dont assume that
[16:34:22] <ajustrun> thanks for the example Eviltwin this is super helpful
[16:36:21] <shoky> rns: that whole page is super slow
[16:36:27] <shoky> (on chrome)
[16:36:46] <rns> shoky, yes and I can't seem to figure out why
[16:36:57] <rns> shoky, is it fast in FF for you?
[16:37:10] <shoky> faster, yeah
[16:37:33] <rns> shoky, could it have something to do with the size of the dropdown menus?
[16:37:34] <shoky> and on IE9 as well
[16:37:53] <shoky> maybe, donno
[16:38:02] <shoky> sec.
[16:38:18] <saedelaere> my this reference is pointing on a td element, with $(this).parent() I want to get the overlaying tr element and then change the css for it if the table row is an odd one
[16:38:24] <saedelaere> anyone an idea how to do this?
[16:38:49] <shoky> rns: im also getting errors in the console
[16:39:34] <Eviltwin> shoky: The "overlaying tr element"
[16:39:37] <Eviltwin> Err
[16:39:45] <Eviltwin> saedelaere: The "overlaying tr element"
[16:39:47] <Eviltwin> What does that mean?
[16:40:43] <systemfault> saedelaere: var $this = $(this), tr = $this.closest('tr'); if (tr.index() % 2 == 0) { tr.css(…..);}  perhaps..
[16:40:52] <systemfault> hmm
[16:40:56] <saedelaere> the table row that holds my table cell <tr><td>my table cell</td></tr>
[16:41:29] <Eviltwin> saedelaere: We refer to that as the "parent" element
[16:41:57] <Eviltwin> What systemfault suggested is probably your best option
[16:42:31] <saedelaere> ok will try that, thanks!
[16:43:51] <shoky> rns: yeah it seems like it doesnt have to do with the tabs
[16:44:24] <write> When we type something on textbox a new div appears at bottom and suggest me to select one of them, that is called autocomplete, how can i do i with jquery ajax?
[16:44:43] <write> What's the line of code to make a new div appear at botom ?
[16:45:06] <write> (#texboxid).append(newdiv); is it?
[16:45:31] <write> But after select one from new div if you hit Enter   ,it's gone
[16:45:41] <write> Like stackoverflow.com or jquery form ask question
[16:47:08] <Eviltwin> Facebook calls them typeaheads
[16:47:30] <phishbot> heh
[16:48:41] <Eviltwin> This maybe? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2518442/autocomplete-functionality-on-a-textarea
[16:52:50] <write> Is it? http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Autocomplete
[16:53:09] <Eviltwin> Maybe
[16:53:24] <rns> shoky, any ideas on how to fix it?
[16:57:47] <shoky> rns: no idea, really weird
[17:00:18] <neumino> Is there any way to listen to the scrollHeight property changes?
[17:00:40] <neumino> Updating the value of an textarea doesn't immediately change the scrollHeight
[17:02:48] <shoky> rns: when i remove most of those options it becomes normal
[17:03:05] <shoky> rns: i wonder why chrome is being stupid
[17:11:28] <shoky> rns: heh, with chrome canary it's fine :P
[17:11:52] <shoky> (i was checking with chrome beta before, btw)
[17:12:16] <shoky> so whatever caused this lameness, they must've fixed it
[17:17:47] <rns> shoky, yea I noticed that when I remove the county dropdown everything runs smoothly
[17:17:55] <rns> shoky, good to know about canary
[17:18:05] <rns> thanks for all your input
[17:18:09] <rns> I really appreciate it
[17:18:24] <shoky> np. nice ~bug :P
[17:19:14] <Germanaz0> hello everybody, I'm trying to open the popup of an hidden input file with the $(element).click()
[17:19:20] <Germanaz0> but is not working in IE or Safari
[17:22:03] <shoky> Germanaz0: and it shouldn't. (even if it's not hidden)
[17:23:14] <shoky> Germanaz0: but it does work for me in IE ..
[17:23:24] <shoky> not in chrome though
[17:24:15] <shoky> nor on firefox (though i get a notification about it)
[17:25:29] <Germanaz0> shoky, and how did you solved ?
[17:25:44] <shoky> i didn't solve anything
[17:26:25] <shoky> javascript shouldn't be able to open the open-file dialog without the user clicking on the input himself
[17:26:32] <shoky> and neither should your site
[17:26:43] <shoky> there, solved.
[17:31:03] <Germanaz0> thats weird
[17:31:05] <Germanaz0> it could be done :S
[17:37:41] <zamn> hey is there any way to get the last div of a collection of divs?
[17:38:03] <zamn> like lets say i have <div id="results"><div id="1"></div> <div id="2"></div></div>
[17:38:10] <zamn> how can i get the 2 without knowing the id is 2
[17:39:05] <zamn> wow .last..
[17:39:06] <zamn> lol
[17:46:03] <Bankzilla> answered your own question within 2mins haha
[18:31:57] <zamn> hey im trying to just get the jsonf rom a json call
[18:32:00] <zamn> i dont want to use $.getJSON
[18:34:51] <shoky> "a json call" ?
[18:34:55] <shoky> zamn use $.ajax
[18:37:25] <zamn> yeah was doing that as i asked that hah
[18:39:01] <zamn> i think im breaking jquery :p
[19:06:41] <ansdev1> hi, say you're working through a server side bootstrap, what's a good practice for only loading components of javascript you need without dealing with multiple files?
[19:07:51] <coldhead> something like require.js, ansdev1 ?
[19:08:06] <ansdev1> ooooh?! this somehow sounds interesting!
[19:08:40] <ansdev1> coldhead:  can you do something like map elements to javascript components and have require load those depending on your page source?
[19:08:43] <datarecall> is there a way to search in jquery if a href val has a string
[19:09:12] <coldhead> not in the way you want, ansdev1
[19:09:21] <ansdev1> hmm?
[19:09:24] <coldhead> it's more for letting you define dependencies between .js files
[19:09:35] <coldhead> without reference to the dom
[19:09:40] <ansdev1> ah i see
[19:09:48] <coldhead> i will bow out, there may be better ways i'm unaware of
[19:09:57] <ansdev1> so you load the specific js file and it will load other dependancies you've mapped
[19:09:58] <Blaster> datarecall:  $('a [href="http://www.example.com"]')
[19:10:12] <ansdev1> thanks coldhead, interesting link anyway :)
[19:10:25] <datarecall> Blaster can you wildcard it ?
[19:11:03] <Blaster> not sure
[19:12:15] <Blaster> $('a').filter(function() { return this.href.match(/example\.com/) }).text('matched')  perhaps
[19:12:48] <datarecall> trying to stay away from regex
[19:12:58] <datarecall> we have 1k urls we wana match up
[19:13:23] <Blaster> anything with wildcard is going to use regex on some level, no?
[19:13:32] <datarecall> yeah i would assume so
[19:13:36] <datarecall> was hoping for a better option
[19:13:57] <wavez> I have a function which I want to terminate early if my animation (fadeOut('slow')) hasn't finished. How do I do that?
[19:14:45] <Blaster> wavez:  show some code
[19:15:02] <datarecall> Blaster if i wanted to match against 10 urls in that function how would you set it up
[19:15:21] <Blaster> datarecall: not quite sure what you mean
[19:15:38] <Blaster> that code will match all URLs with example.com in the href attribute
[19:15:43] <datarecall> like in that function you gave me you had example.com what if i wanted to see if it had 10 diff urls
[19:15:59] <datarecall> so if example.com google.com yahoo.com .text('matched')
[19:16:51] <Blaster> $('a').filter(function() { return this.href.match(/example\.com|google\.com|yahoo\.com/) }.text('matched')  I thin
[19:18:00] <Blaster> datarecall: http://jsfiddle.net/gTrZJ/
[19:20:19] <supernaught> Hey all
[19:20:49] <supernaught> I'm new to web programming and was wondering if anyone could tell me how hard multiple image uploading is?
[19:21:01] <datarecall> Blaster would that method also be the same  for div id or class names but i dont need wildcards
[19:21:05] <wavez> Blaster, http://jsfiddle.net/wavez/DV2CB/5/
[19:21:15] <supernaught> everything I found via Google mentioned using flash
[19:21:39] <wavez> Blaster, I want the FlipCard function to not execute if the current fade hasn't finished
[19:21:41] <Blaster> datarecall:  If you just want to select by class or id attribute then you can do $('div[id="myId"]')
[19:22:04] <datarecall> Blaster hmm but again were going to have a list of say 1k different classes and id's
[19:22:10] <shoky> $('#myId') is faster
[19:22:26] <datarecall> so #myid,#id2,#anotherid
[19:22:26] <Blaster> touche
[19:22:51] <shoky> $('#myid,#id2,#anotherid')
[19:23:20] <datarecall> would it be best to test if the id exists or not ?
[19:23:25] <Blaster> wavez:  http://api.jquery.com/animated-selector/
[19:23:33] <Blaster> datarecall:  no
[19:23:48] <shoky> datarecall: what is best depends on what you are doing, anyways
[19:25:10] <Blaster> wavez:  In your case you'll probably want to use .not(':animated')
[19:25:15] <shoky> anyway it's always best to avoid querying the DOM a lot
[19:26:23] <wavez> Blaster, so I want to do something like if($animated_objects == none){   ?
[19:27:30] <shoky> supernaught: if you don't care about pseudo-browsers (i.e. IE) then you don't need flash
[19:27:59] <shoky> i think.
[19:28:10] <supernaught> what should I use instead?  ( <--- complete web programming newb)
[19:28:22] <Blaster> wavez:  You want to run the FlipCard if $a or $b is not currently in animation ?
[19:28:27] <shoky> do you care about old IE ?
[19:28:33] <wavez> Blaster, right
[19:29:22] <Blaster> actually by $a and $b we mean $front and $back right?
[19:29:22] <pawn> Using UI sortables. How do I get an event triggered when an element is sorted, and how do I get which position it was in, and which position it is in now?
[19:29:41] <shoky> supernaught two popular plugins are uploadify and blueimp's jQuery file upload
[19:29:49] <Blaster> if($a.not(':animated')) { FlipCard($front, $back) }   Something like that?
[19:29:51] <pawn> If I have 0,1,2,3 and I move 2 to position 0, then how do I get an event that gives me this information?
[19:30:25] <supernaught> shoky: thanks for the tip. I'll check 'em out.
[19:36:11] <wavez> Blaster, I gave that a try. No luck. http://jsfiddle.net/wavez/DV2CB/6/
[19:38:10] <shoky> pawn: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/gEB89/
[19:38:41] <shoky> pawn: if you care only about when the position has changed then you only need the 'update' event. otherwise you need start & stop
[19:40:03] <pawn> shoky: there's update and change events
[19:40:17] <pawn> change happens during sorting
[19:41:23] <shoky> pawn: so?
[19:41:32] <shoky> pawn: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/gEB89/1/
[19:41:40] <pawn> shoky: I want the item's index on the change event.
[19:43:08] <shoky> well why didn't you say so :\
[19:43:43] <pawn> shoky: idk. I'm kinda trying to figure out all various things. I will need the code you examplified though, thanks. :)
[19:43:58] <pawn> But, I'll also need the new index for every change event.
[19:44:06] <pawn> new and old index for every change event*
[19:44:27] <pawn> What I'm doing is animating another series of images based on the sorting of these other elements
[19:45:03] <shoky> while the user is dragging the element?
[19:45:56] <pawn> So, as the user sorts these "index elements", as I call them internally, a series of image elements animate and reflect that sorting.
[19:47:54] <shoky> pawn: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/gEB89/2/
[19:48:03] <shoky> a bit hackish though
[19:48:36] <shoky> (of course, you dont have to update the 'frompos' on each change like i did)
[19:49:03] <pawn> shoky: was going to say that. ;P
[19:49:11] <shoky> ;p
[19:49:16] <pawn> I like this solution.
[19:49:24] <shoky> goodie
[19:49:32] <pawn> Thank you shoky! :)
[19:49:36] <shoky> np ;]
[19:51:37] <shoky> it could be made less hackish, sec
[19:56:37] <teewuane> hrmm, 1.8b1 is out?
[19:57:22] <shoky> yeah
[19:57:37] <shoky> b2 next week i think
[19:58:50] <teewuane> shoky: just from the git repo or where can i get it?
[19:59:43] <shoky> teewuane: http://blog.jquery.com/2012/06/22/jquery-1-8-beta-1-see-whats-coming-and-going/
[20:01:57] <pawn> shoky: are you going to still do the less hacky version, or should I just go with the shown solution? :)
[20:02:06] <pawn> What were you thinking was so hacky about it?
[20:02:20] <ragnok> shoky, have you got any good jquery code, commented, for learning purposes?
[20:03:50] <shoky> pawn i started but got borked. just didnt like getting the .index() for the placeholder and having to subtract 1 from it
[20:04:45] <shoky> ragnok: nothing that comes to mind right now. have you seen paul irish's "10 things i learned from jquery source code" videos?
[20:05:32] <ragnok> yup, i wtched that one
[20:08:24] <shoky> pawn: this is what i meant to do http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/gEB89/3/
[20:08:37] <pawn> shoky: what's placeholder?
[20:08:40] <shoky> dont have to decrease 1 that way ;D
[20:09:28] <shoky> pawn: it's the empty space that moves when you drag the sortable
[20:09:30] <pawn> But you have to do a bunch of other traversal.
[20:09:48] <shoky> true, but it might be more.. robust, i donno ;P
[20:10:19] <shoky> actually fuck it, just use the -1 :)
[20:10:29] <pawn> haha
[20:10:33] <pawn> Hmm
[20:12:14] <shoky> ragnok: i'd just pick some jq plugin i like that doesn't seem trivial to me, and figure out how it works
[20:13:00] <shoky> i find it more stimulating when its undocumented tho ;P
[20:13:02] <pawn> Hey, how do I change the position of an element using an index?
[20:13:26] <shoky> in the sortable?
[20:13:42] <pawn> Say, I took $set.eq(3) and wanted to move it to where $set.eq(1) was. Not in sortable, in jquery generally.
[20:14:10] <pawn> Do I do $set.eq(0).after($set.eq(3)); ?
[20:15:02] <shoky> what do you mean, where $set.eq(1) _was_ ?
[20:15:05] <shoky> where is it now?
[20:15:27] <shoky> and who says .eq(1) is right after .eq(0) ?
[20:16:01] <zamNN> hey im trying to use $.ajax() as follows here: https://github.com/zamN/ytMusic/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/search.js#L17 and for some reason I'm getting an error (here: https://gist.github.com/20362b4bef8f0844dedc)
[20:16:06] <zamNN> what am i doing wrong? :p
[20:16:34] <shoky> zamNN: that's not an error, that's a stack trace
[20:16:41] <pawn> shoky: isn't eq(1) always after eq(0)?
[20:16:46] <shoky> you didnt paste the actual error description
[20:17:06] <shoky> pawn:  eq(1) is the 2nd selected element, eq(0) is the first.
[20:17:07] <zamNN> shoky: sorry, there is no error. chrome just says "Pause at XML HTTP Request"
[20:17:30] <shoky> pawn:  $('div').eq(0) could be some div somewhere and .eq(1) could be some div in a totally different part of the page
[20:17:48] <shoky> pause, huh
[20:18:07] <zamNN> yes
[20:18:11] <zamNN> let me give you the exact error
[20:18:12] <coldhead> zamNN: maybe you have a breakpoint enabled for AJAX requests?
[20:18:17] <shoky> zamNN are you sure that's the exact text chrome is saying..? not finding any google results for that
[20:18:17] <zamNN> i was thinking that..
[20:18:32] <zamNN> it says "Paused on a XMLHttpRequest."
[20:18:34] <pawn> shoky: Good point.
[20:18:41] <coldhead> also i would be a little more specifc in my ajax(), by specifying the type and dataType
[20:18:46] <coldhead> also i am so cold
[20:19:17] <pawn> In other words. How do I take an element at position x and move it to element2 at position y?
[20:19:44] <shoky> pawn: that's not specific enough
[20:19:49] <pawn> I know.. hang tight
[20:20:27] <shoky> pawn: generally, you'd .detach() the element and then add it somewhere else, e.g. with .append or .after
[20:20:44] <pawn> shoky: I see.
[20:20:52] <pawn> I think I'll just have to figure it out from there.
[20:21:35] <pawn> And to re-order the jquery set, I'll have to re-query?
[20:23:37] <shoky> if there is a reason for the order to change, then yeah, i guess
[20:25:04] <shoky> goodnight
[20:27:55] <coldhead> ircjsbot: tell tintin i will never forget you
[20:27:56] <ircjsbot> coldhead, OK, I will tell tintin if I see them.
[20:28:00] <coldhead> thanks ircjsbot
[20:31:15] <pawn> How do I make the sortable prevent the click event?
[20:31:31] <pawn> ..the click event from triggering on my items
[20:35:38] <coldhead> i wish i thought it would end
[20:35:43] <coldhead> i just wish i thought it would end

[20:57:14] <coldhead> good talking to you, pawn
[20:58:40] <wavez> I have a <div> that I am asigning a function to run on .click() event. I have links in the div. Those links don't work now because of the .click() function. How do I fix this?
[21:01:17] <cannjeff> You want the link and the click event to both work?
[21:01:41] <wavez> cannjeff, yes
[21:02:03] <cannjeff> Where does the link take you?
[21:03:00] <wavez> cannjeff, there's 4 links, all to other pages.
[21:03:49] <cannjeff> waves, just trying to figure out why you'd want the link to bring you to another page but also call the click event
[21:03:52] <cannjeff> could you explain?
[21:04:30] <wavez> cannjeff, I want the div to do something else when it is clicked on. So the div itself is a different click area than the links it contains.
[21:04:58] <cannjeff> alright one mine
[21:05:00] <cannjeff> *minute
[21:08:11] <cannjeff> wavez: http://jsfiddle.net/YPRXD/
[21:09:29] <cannjeff> Do you want the div click to not call the anchor link click?
[21:10:27] <wavez> I want the anchor link to not call the div click event
[21:11:06] <wavez> I think I will just add an anchor in the background with a span to fill the entire div, and place the click event on that anchor instead of the div.
[21:11:23] <cannjeff> Oh alright now i get it h/o
[21:15:51] <HaremNoJutsu> How do I use jQuery to get my scrollbar of a textbox to scroll all the way to bottom? eg. <textarea class="foo">Some text</textarea>
[21:18:10] <cannjeff> wavez: sorry i need to leave, but check out event bubbling and event capturing
[21:18:20] <cannjeff> that will solve you issue but I have to go
[21:18:26] <wavez> ok, super. Thank you cannjeff.
[21:18:28] <cannjeff> my appoligizes
[21:18:35] <wavez> no worries. Thanks for your help.

[21:20:55] <felipevieira> I'm trying to do an ajax request, my server is returning 200 OK but I still get the error callback instead the sucess callback. The thrownError variable is empty. Does anyone know what can it be?
[21:21:09] <rudyl313> anybody know of a great solution for a date and time picker?
[21:31:47] <Cork> felipevieira: thats usually cause the code crashes
[21:32:00] <Cork> felipevieira: ex. cause the json is invalid
[21:33:49] <felipevieira> Cork, I've tried not using json, but text as dataType, but the error persists
[21:34:03] <HaremNoJutsu> Cork: what does [0] mean in -> $('#scroll')[0];
[21:34:27] <Cork> HaremNoJutsu: its the same as .get see ?.get
[21:34:33] <Cork> <_<
[21:34:40] * Cork poks bot-t
[21:35:01] <Cork> HaremNoJutsu: http://api.jquery.com/get/
[21:35:13] <HaremNoJutsu> Cork: var height = $('#scroll')[0].scrollHeight;   $('#scroll').scrollTop(height);
[21:35:37] <HaremNoJutsu> Cork: using this to make div scroll to bottom, but don't get [0] part.
[21:35:59] <Cork> HaremNoJutsu: scrollHeight is ran on the dom object
[21:36:32] <HaremNoJutsu> Cork: Yes, and...
[21:36:57] <Cork> HaremNoJutsu: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.scrollHeight
[21:38:42] <Cork> felipevieira: you have a link?
[21:38:48] <HaremNoJutsu> Cork: I tried something like var $myDiv = $('div.scroll');  var $height = $myDiv[0].scrollHeight;   $myDiv.scrollTop($height);
[21:38:58] <HaremNoJutsu> Cork: but failed.
[21:39:10] <Cork> HaremNoJutsu: "failed"?
[21:39:24] <HaremNoJutsu> Cork: Yeah, nothing happened.
[21:39:28] <Cork> ok
[21:39:32] <felipevieira> Cork, My application is running localhost, by now. Some code would be useful?
[21:39:36] <Cork> have a link?
[21:40:58] <Cork> felipevieira: its better then nothing, but live code is prob needed
[21:44:06] <HaremNoJutsu> Cork: var height = $('#scroll')[0].scrollHeight; <--- no mention in link what [0] does?
[21:44:24] <Cork> HaremNoJutsu: its in the first link
[21:44:46] <HaremNoJutsu> Cork: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.scrollHeight?
[21:44:54] <systemfault> HaremNoJutsu: It unwraps the jquery object, giving you a normal DOM node.
[21:44:55] <Cork> thats the last link
[21:45:07] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/get/
[21:45:14] <felipevieira> Cork, the code is very simple. My Javascript is this http://pastebin.com/bc9zLksf
[21:45:29] * Cork nods
[21:45:37] <Cork> felipevieira: so live code is needed
[21:51:14] <HaremNoJutsu> Cork: any idea why this doesn't scroll to bottom?  var $myDiv = $('div.scroll');  var $height = $myDiv[0].scrollHeight;   $myDiv.scrollTop($height);
[21:51:54] <Cork> HaremNoJutsu: i would need to see the working code
[21:52:53] <youareno6> I am trying to use grep to create a separate list from a nested JSON object. http://jsfiddle.net/jHEaD/2/
[21:53:54] <youareno6> I must be missing something, but looks right.
[21:57:21] <Cork> youareno6: http://jsfiddle.net/jHEaD/3/
[21:57:29] <Cork> you want .map not .grep
[21:58:38] <youareno6> Humm, still undefined
[21:59:02] <LoneStar99> howdy trying to remove class from div but not working -->http://jsfiddle.net/hwdy/Emk78/
[21:59:45] <Cork> youareno6: http://jsfiddle.net/jHEaD/4/
[22:00:30] <Cork> LoneStar99: cause the class isn't on that element
[22:01:05] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/Emk78/1/
[22:01:22] <Cork> LoneStar99: why are you using getElementById btw?
[22:01:54] <youareno6> Cork: Thanks.
[22:02:07] <youareno6> LoneStar99: Thinking the same thing.
[22:02:41] <LoneStar99> cork the code is being cleaned up, has regular js in it
[22:05:04] <LoneStar99> Cork: in your code the "hello world" not showing up in grey rts-usr div...
[22:07:07] <LoneStar99> cork sorry i see what is going on thanks
[22:07:10] <LoneStar99> works
[22:07:17] <Cork> LoneStar99: nether did your
[22:07:18] <Cork> :9
[22:08:09] <LoneStar99> ok what if i want it to appear in grey box?
[22:08:12] <Cork> LoneStar99: but why don't you just use jquery there?
[22:08:41] <LoneStar99> i will change to jquery.
[22:10:20] <HaremNoJutsu> Cork: i can get jsfiddle test case to work but my working code will not. I get height 0
[22:11:38] <Cork> LoneStar99: http://jsfiddle.net/Emk78/2/
[22:11:45] <LoneStar99> yeah got it
[22:12:06] <LoneStar99> it was regular js screwing things up
[22:12:26] <Cork> LoneStar99: or for the old code http://jsfiddle.net/Emk78/3/
[22:13:07] <LoneStar99> i did the following --> http://jsfiddle.net/hwdy/Emk78/4/
[22:13:55] <LoneStar99> thanks, cork
[22:13:58] <Cork> np
[22:24:06] <HaremNoJutsu> Cork: is scrollHeight in px?
[22:24:25] <Cork> yes
[22:35:30] <LoneStar99> cork what about removing content from class "foo" --> <div class="foo">boohoo</div>
[22:36:09] <Cork> LoneStar99: run .empty() on the element
[22:36:18] <Cork> or .remove if you want to remove the element too
[22:36:37] <LoneStar99> oh ok  thanks

[23:16:07] <speyburn> hi guys, im having bit of a problem.. i have an array with the following structure: http://pastebin.com/Nk0ZAcHG im having a really hard time to get the each() function working, how could i get the values out, lets say if i want to get each of the 'bssid5':s out?
[23:17:40] <coldhead> speyburn: i can't see what form your array actually has there
[23:17:53] <coldhead> if you can paste the actual JS array we can help you process it
[23:22:40] <speyburn> coldhead: its a self built javascript array with arrays in it, how could i get the actual array out?
[23:23:44] <coldhead> speyburn: how do you get it into the page?
[23:23:53] <coldhead> is there a script file or is it an ajax response?
[23:24:03] <speyburn> oh
[23:24:09] <speyburn> coldhead: just a sec
[23:25:10] <coldhead> copy that, speyburn, roger
[23:26:35] <speyburn> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/FyL87/ so basically the var d the string of data is just a dummy data that resembles the data that i receive in my application, i the code just parses it and makes it an array.
[23:26:59] <speyburn> coldhead: i dont know if i should convert it to json or something?
[23:27:42] <coldhead> this looks okay
[23:27:55] <coldhead> so this bit is working, you're building an array you're happy with, right?
[23:28:04] <coldhead> it's iterating over the end result that is the struggle?
[23:28:51] <speyburn> pretty much yes, im not sure if that array structure etc is the best but thats the best solution that i came up with
[23:29:15] <speyburn> and now when i need to start working with the array im running to problems
[23:31:25] <coldhead> masterArray should be an object, not an array
[23:31:34] <coldhead> because you're using non-numeric indexes
[23:31:54] <coldhead> and singledata needs a 'var' before it
[23:32:33] <speyburn> damn, i had it as an object earlier
[23:32:37] <coldhead> speyburn: this seems to do what you meant http://jsfiddle.net/FyL87/2/
[23:32:49] <coldhead> it logs masterArray to your console at the end
[23:32:49] <speyburn> but then i had some problems with the pushing of new values
[23:33:13] <coldhead> oh but wait then it seems to be setting an empty array as the value
[23:33:18] <coldhead> which isn't what you want >: |
[23:34:05] <coldhead> i think lines you have like this: var bssid5arr = new Array(bssid5);
[23:34:12] <coldhead> should actually be = [bssid5]
[23:34:21] <coldhead> because new Array(n) creates an array with n entries
[23:34:27] <coldhead> not an entry which is n
[23:35:16] <speyburn> hmm.. okay
[23:41:22] <speyburn> coldhead: you mean that var bssid5arr = new Array(bssid5);
[23:41:37] <speyburn> should be like bssid5arr = new Array[bssid5]; ?
[23:49:35] <coldhead> speyburn: no, no need for new Array()
[23:49:43] <coldhead> you can just create an array literal with []
[23:50:04] <coldhead> x = [5] === x = new Array(); x[0] = 5;
[23:52:09] <coldhead> eval [4,5,6]
[23:52:10] <caniuse> coldhead: [ 4, 5, 6 ]
[23:52:10] <speyburn> coldhead: mm.. okay :P
[23:52:39] <coldhead> eval x = new Array(); x[0] = 5; x[1] = 5; x[2] = 6; x
[23:52:40] <caniuse> coldhead: [ 5, 5, 6 ]
[23:52:46] <coldhead> oops but you see my point
[23:52:54] <coldhead> array literals are succinct
[23:53:49] <speyburn> yeah i fixed it :) well now when i have the whole thing as an object how can i get the values out? :D
[23:54:12] <coldhead> can you save a working demo to jsfiddle?
[23:54:16] <coldhead> then i can mess with it
[23:54:21] <speyburn> coldhead: k, just a sec
[23:56:59] <speyburn> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/FyL87/3/ well theres the code atm
[23:57:26] <speyburn> coldhead: dont know what should be the best way of testing the each but?
