[00:59:33] <anton2299> anybody knows a  chrome extension that replaces certain words while loading any page?
[00:59:55] <robertmaxrees> anton2299 2 questions: 1- whatfor? 2- that's... not a jquery question lol
[01:00:02] <robertmaxrees> oh it's sydbarrett.
[01:00:23] <anton2299> you traidor stop banning
[01:00:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[01:00:49] <robertmaxrees> anyway - quick google search should be good enough for that.
[01:00:57] <anton2299> yes thanks i got it
[01:01:07] <robertmaxrees> lol "traidor"
[01:02:23] <robertmaxrees> what's funny is that ban expired almost 3 weeks ago :shrug:
[01:44:59] <Cork> what is funny is that some ppl seam to think "go to a channel and ask your hards desire, what ever it is"
[01:45:24] <Cork> hards==hearts
[01:45:30] <robertmaxrees> seriously.  what's funny is he asked over in ##javascript first, then came here when his question wasn't immediately answered.
[01:45:54] <Cork> well many extensions use jquery, isn't that reason enough? >_>
[01:46:03] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[01:46:04] <Cork> eeeh?
[01:46:34] <Cork> kinda annoying that chrome doesn't have a user support channel
[01:46:50] <Cork> for firefox you can at least point them to #firefox (where it is actaully on topic)
[01:47:04] <robertmaxrees> there's #chromium :shrug:
[01:47:11] <robertmaxrees> or, y'know... the internet.
[01:47:16] <Cork> ya
[01:48:41] <robertmaxrees> i think some folks just can't hang.
[12:47:24] <Alexandro71> hello, i need help with cors
[12:47:56] <Cork> Alexandro71: if you want help ask the question not for someone
[12:50:00] <Alexandro71> my code is `$.ajax('http://localhost:8000');` mas recebo o erro : Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8000/' from origin 'http://localhost' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
[12:51:14] <Alexandro71> no log do servidor tem a mensagem `[01/Oct/2020 16:38:51] "OPTIONS /users HTTP/1.1" 200 7`
[12:51:36] <Alexandro71> error: `Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8000/' from origin 'http://localhost' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.`
[12:53:08] <Alexandro71> sorry, i'm a native speaker of portuguese and mixed without realizing it when writing with english.
[12:53:50] <Alexandro71> server log : `[01/Oct/2020 16:38:51] "OPTIONS /users HTTP/1.1" 200 7`
[12:55:57] <Alexandro71> when i use google chrome browser extensions like ReqBin and PostMan the request is performed even though there is no host allowed in the api settings
[12:59:52] <Alexandro71> How can I make this request correctly?
[13:12:49] <robertmaxrees> Alexandro71 you need to configure your server to allow it.
[13:13:02] <robertmaxrees> it's a browser/server issue, not a javascript one.
[13:36:27] <AlexandroGonSan> Thank you very much for the answer, I am looking for a solution.
[13:37:26] <robertmaxrees> you need to either match the port, protocol, and domain between the page you're serving and the endpoint you're hitting, or allow CORS either for that specific PPD or just for everything (avoid the latter)
[13:50:08] <AlexandroGonSan> I set ALLOWED_HOSTS on the server to ['localhost', 'http://localhost', 'localhost/', 'http://localhost/', 'http://localhost:80/', 'http://localhost:80'], I solved the first error of using `$.ajax('localhost:8000')` instead of `$.ajax('localhost:8000')` when I did not enter the protocol, I also tested on `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']` but the same error
[13:50:09] <AlexandroGonSan> continues, what is PPD?
[13:50:40] <robertmaxrees> port, protocol, and domain.
[13:51:09] <AlexandroGonSan> errate: I solved the first error of using `$.ajax('localhost:8000')` instead of `$.ajax('http://localhost:8000')`
[13:52:01] <robertmaxrees> "errate"?
[13:53:54] <robertmaxrees> AlexandroGonSan so what's the specific issue you're facing now?
[13:53:59] <AlexandroGonSan> I wrote a wrong information
[13:59:11] <AlexandroGonSan> is the same problem as when I came to ask for help, I was just reporting the problems that I managed to solve before
[13:59:23] <robertmaxrees> can you re-state the problem you're having then?
[13:59:32] <robertmaxrees> so we're all on the same page :)
[14:12:54] <AlexandroGonSan> When performing an ajax request with `$.ajax('http://localhost:8000/users/')` I receive the following error message: `Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8000/users' from origin 'http://localhost' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is
[14:12:54] <AlexandroGonSan> present on the requested resource.`
[14:14:07] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so the page is on http://localhost, but the resource is hosted on http://localhost:8000 ?
[14:15:58] <robertmaxrees> AlexandroGonSan ^
[14:16:34] <AlexandroGonSan> Yes
[14:16:34] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to guess that you changed cors settings at the endpoint level and not the server level, yeah?
[14:17:10] <robertmaxrees> AlexandroGonSan yes to which? :)
[14:19:12] <robertmaxrees> lol welp
[14:23:39] <shoky> AlexandroGonSan ALLOWED_HOSTS is not relevant to CORS. assuming you're using django.. you can use something like this  https://pypi.org/project/django-cors-headers/
[14:26:07] <AlexandroGonSan> yes, the resource is hosted on http://localhost:8000
[14:26:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:26:28] <AlexandroGonSan> yes, the resource is a django app
[14:27:53] <AlexandroGonSan> Insert 'localhost' in the ALLOWED_HOSTS configuration - although that doesn't seem to matter. But I didn't understand, change the color settings at the endpoint level and not at the server level? The django application in this case is the server, correct? but wouldn't the endpoint settings be the server settings themselves?
[14:28:13] <robertmaxrees> did you see what shoky said?
[14:31:15] <AlexandroGonSan> yes, i saw it, but i'm researching a little more how it is done, i will test
[14:41:38] <AlexandroGonSan> robertmaxrees i saw it, but i'm researching a little more how it is done, i will test
[14:41:57] <AlexandroGonSan> it worked, thank you very much
[14:43:04] <AlexandroGonSan> thank you very much, robertmaxrees and shoky
[15:09:54] <factor> Can I use js to detect if a strikethrough character is in the class?
[15:17:26] <factor> Actually still looking for how it makes the strike through. Not in the js or the dynamic view of the js.
[15:17:55] <robertmaxrees> just joined - factor what was the question?
[15:18:41] <factor> Was looking for soe code to detect a strikethrough character.
[15:18:48] <factor> some^
[15:18:51] <robertmaxrees> "a strikethrough character"?
[15:19:04] <factor> its not in the page by default.
[15:19:11] <robertmaxrees> can you show an example?
[15:26:21] <factor> robertmaxrees: here is the issue. https://imgur.com/EzpHfiw
[15:26:34] <factor> I need to detect when the strike through is present.
[15:27:02] <factor> class is Woo-PriceLarge rs-layer
[15:27:45] <factor> bdi is the special tag
[15:27:49] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to either .hasClass() or .css('property-name-here') and check those.
[15:27:56] <factor> for the strikethrough to takeplace
[15:28:01] <robertmaxrees> not clear on how they're getting the strikethrough there.
[15:28:08] <factor> Nor I
[15:28:31] <robertmaxrees> is there a text-decoration somewhere in their css?
[15:28:59] <factor> Nope , that thatI can see, in the wrap class or the specific bdi tag
[15:29:20] <robertmaxrees> are you filtering int he "styles" pane to the right?
[15:29:51] <factor> I can see the ==$0 usually means some dynamic stuff is going on.
[15:30:07] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with my question :)
[15:30:09] <factor> yes I have the style active.
[15:30:19] <robertmaxrees> so there's a text-decoration in there?
[15:30:22] <factor> I even right clicked copy style and nothing.
[15:30:58] <robertmaxrees> without seeing it it's hard to help :/
[15:31:09] <robertmaxrees> something is applying that style.  just gotta figure out what it is.
[15:31:14] <robertmaxrees> *what the style is, rather.
[15:31:39] <factor> okay thanks
[15:32:17] <robertmaxrees> sorry i can't do more to help.
[15:32:27] <robertmaxrees> (can you link to the page in question?)
[15:32:41] <factor> and text-decoration is none. So i imagine some dynamic activity is going on to do it.
[15:32:49] <factor> its internal.
[15:33:05] <robertmaxrees> right so the styles tab will show dynamically set styles.
[15:33:12] <factor> Dont have an example external.
[15:33:19] <robertmaxrees> so that detail is completely irrelevant :)
[15:37:46] <factor> i can even put text-decoration:none !important; and it still does not go away.
[15:38:07] <robertmaxrees> then it's on the wrong element or it's using some other style to make the strikethrough happen.
[15:39:04] <factor> Right
[15:39:19] <factor> Going through all the upper elements
[15:39:59] <factor> found it two elements up tag called del
[15:40:19] <factor> forced none on the element
[15:40:30] <robertmaxrees> and it worked?
[15:41:11] <factor> will see will refresh to check again
[15:41:38] <robertmaxrees> also: if it's getting applied client-side there may be an issue detecting it.
[15:42:55] <robertmaxrees> w/r/t race conditions, that is.
[15:44:07] <factor> robertmaxrees: Thanks for the help yes found it in the custom del tag.
[15:44:23] <robertmaxrees> cool
[15:45:15] <Cork> fyi: del isn't custom, it is a standard tag
[15:46:01] <robertmaxrees> anything is custom if you say it is üòè
[15:46:07] <factor> heh , well I have to search for del not div. Its custom for me :P
[15:46:18] <Cork> heh
[15:46:40] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:46:43] <factor> That was the stumbling block(element)
[15:47:33] <Cork> ya, just wanted to clear out it isn't a made up element like many bigger sites like to use
[15:47:46] <Cork> (blogger i'm looking at you)
[15:53:38] <factor> Looks like I may only need to detect a del tag as www3 school says a browser will add a strikethroughfor this tag in use
[15:54:35] <factor> had not known this. But this is the case and is a stndard tag for doing this.
[15:54:38] <Cork> del is meant to mark deleted text ya (btw avoid w3schools)
[15:54:42] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^
[15:54:46] <factor> heh
[15:55:14] <Cork> it has nothing do do with w3 and has lots of information problems and bad history
[15:55:19] <robertmaxrees> when searching for info on anything web, go to google and prepend the subject with "mdn"
[15:55:38] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/del much better information overall.
[15:55:53] <Cork> ya, and even though it is called "mozilla developer network" lots of sources colaborate in it
[15:56:00] <factor> okay
[15:56:01] <Cork> including google and microsoft
[15:56:12] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:56:18] <robertmaxrees> and they're not trying to sell you anything :)
