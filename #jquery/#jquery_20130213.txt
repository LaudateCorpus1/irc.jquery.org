[00:28:15] <Nancy2012> i have a calendar which is written in php so far.. and bit js code especially for the look.. and on my view, it places under a div… is it possible to load this calendar through jquery…. which means.. i want to pass the details in ajax and show up on the view
[00:29:34] <Nancy2012> i just want to load details which comes from database over this calendar by jquery ajax
[00:29:38] <Nancy2012> is it possible?
[00:43:59] <Mohsen_Hassani> How can I detect if a string entered is in Persian language? I want to stop the user from entering his/her name in English.
[00:44:54] <Cork> Mohsen_Hassani: i don't think you can
[00:44:56] <ffwacom> apparantly you can't add methods to Object if you use jquery because it breaks the 'for (foo in bar)' construct, could you patch jquery to use hasOwnProperty? or does it need to use methods up the prototype chain?
[00:55:28] <ffwacom> is the patch possible? if not why?
[01:02:59] <krz> does it matter where i put $(document).ready(function() { ?
[01:03:10] <krz> or should i always place this on the bottom of my markup?
[01:04:03] <Cork> kry: you shouldn't use ready at the bottom of the body
[01:04:13] <Cork> that will sometimes break in ie
[01:06:12] <Pal-JQ> Hi to every one......Can any one please give you idea about......i have one div in that i wanna calculate the x,y axis and line width when the user clicked and hold and marking  as a line in div part....
[01:07:02] <Pal-JQ> like drag
[01:07:49] <Pal-JQ> @Cork.......i hope you have some idea about my problem......
[01:08:34] <Cork> Pal-JQ: you can use mousemove and click to grab the cursor position
[01:08:59] <Cork> if you actually want to draw a line between the two, you would have to use svg or canvas
[01:12:01] <Pal-JQ> @Cork.......ya i am using mousemove but not able to find the exact position. that line with and height from top,left,right,bottom of the div
[01:12:44] <Cork> Pal-JQ: check the event variable
[01:13:30] <Pal-JQ> Ok i will check
[01:24:02] <fabioportieri> hi, i have done a simple animation on hover on a menu.. thing i ve noticed is the excessive delay before the animation is triggered, right after the user hover on the element.. how is it solvable?
[01:24:35] <Cork> ?p @ fabioportieri
[01:24:35] <bot-t> fabioportieri, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:26:45] <fabioportieri> yep one moment
[01:29:03] <fabioportieri> mm dunno how to put images into jsfiddle
[01:29:24] <Cork> fabioportieri: you can't, you have to link to other sites
[01:29:36] <fabioportieri> oh, ok then
[01:34:46] <fabioportieri> http://jsfiddle.net/W9qPu/ for some reason the js isn't working there, though
[01:35:26] <fabioportieri> maybe i got wrong code ops
[01:37:32] <fabioportieri> dunno, in jsfiddle won't works
[01:37:53] <Cork> fabioportieri: you need the easing lib
[01:37:59] <Cork> (Add Resources
[01:38:02] <Cork> *)
[01:38:18] <fabioportieri> oh right, thanks
[01:38:22] <fabioportieri> i forgot
[01:39:08] <fabioportieri> http://jsfiddle.net/W9qPu/1/
[01:40:21] <fabioportieri> another issue i have with that is the first animation got clumsy as is it was invoked more then once, i tried setting a guard flag to force the setInterval to be called only one but no effect
[01:40:30] <Cork> the easing reasource is still missing...
[01:41:08] <fabioportieri> i imported jquery ui that has it built in
[01:42:03] <fabioportieri> doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/W9qPu/4/
[01:42:17] <Cork> it does
[01:43:44] <fabioportieri> so i wondered how to minimize the delay before each animation starts
[01:43:59] <Cork> i think its the easing causing the apperance of the delay
[01:44:11] <fabioportieri> because i did it based on a preexisting flash animation that did it faster
[01:45:23] <fabioportieri> Cork: even with linear easing it's same result
[01:45:42] <Cork> fabioportieri: also your using setInterval for the animation
[01:45:54] <Cork> ya, was still reading through the code
[01:46:04] <Cork> setInterval waits the time, then triggers the function
[01:46:18] <Cork> so that code means you get 500ms before the animation starts
[01:46:28] <fabioportieri> ah i get it
[01:47:00] <Cork> a better option is to give a function to the animation callback that does the next animation
[01:47:13] <Cork> and then call stop() on the element when you want the animation to stop
[01:47:33] <fabioportieri> but how can i avoid setinterval?
[01:47:43] <Cork> animation is async
[01:47:46] <Cork> so you don't need it
[01:48:33] <Cork> just let animProgressHandler.animate call the next itteration in the animation
[01:48:40] <Cork> have it to an eternal loop
[01:48:50] <Cork> (recursive call a function that does the animation)
[01:49:00] <fabioportieri> ah i see
[01:49:18] <fabioportieri> yes that sound as a better idea
[01:49:23] <Cork> also you might want to have a look at css3 keyframe
[01:49:35] <Cork> that might be a way to do this with gpu acceleration
[01:49:55] <Cork> it has less of a backwards support for ie though
[01:50:10] <fabioportieri> figures
[01:50:48] <Nancy2012> Just to need to know how to pass json data that i got it after ajax response to php ??? i m tying to fetch the data from database and shows up on the calendar that is mainly written in php here is code.. http://jsfiddle.net/DQk7U/
[01:50:51] <Cork> and its declarative animations becomes quite much less code :)
[01:51:45] <Cork> Nancy2012: not really sure what the question is
[01:51:57] <Cork> is result not the json?
[01:51:59] <Cork> or what?
[01:52:24] <fabioportieri> Cork: yeah i'm looking at it cool stuff
[01:52:26] <Nancy2012> i have result in json that i want to load on php based calendar
[01:52:26] <Nancy2012>  
[01:52:53] <Cork> Nancy2012: well to start with you should set header application/json so that the json is flagged as json
[01:52:56] <Nancy2012> as you can see.. i have fetching data by ajax call
[01:53:21] <Cork> ?g php header application/json
[01:53:21] <b-ot> Cork: php - correct HTTP header for json file - Stack Overflow → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/267546/correct-http-header-for-json-file
[01:53:22] <Nancy2012> Cork: on ajax call??
[01:53:32] <Cork> Nancy2012: in the php code
[01:53:39] <Nancy2012> ok let me check
[01:53:41] <Nancy2012> thanks
[01:54:13] <Cork> if you don't the data will be sent as text/html by default; and that means jquery will read the response as text not json
[01:56:28] <Nancy2012> to be honest.. i dont have any idea how can i show up this json data on the calenday by passing it into php
[01:56:47] <Nancy2012> i got all the data by ajax calling
[01:57:25] <Nancy2012> my problem is just to know how can i convert this fetched json data into php so i can pass it to my php code..
[01:58:23] <anew> nancy you have to convert it with php
[01:58:44] <anew> json_decode
[02:00:13] <Nancy2012> but is it possible that i will sent this fected json data to an id so i can use this json data to php by json_decode función  success      : function(result) { $('#cuposcalendar').show();}
[02:00:39] <gebbione> Hi I am getting an error when loading jquery either from the jquery site using he lastest src or from google cdn ... http://pastebin.com/h00fUyPn
[02:00:45] <Cork> Nancy2012: you can't pass ajax to php
[02:01:00] <Cork> Nancy2012: php is run server side, and ajax/javascript is client side
[02:01:32] <Nancy2012> so what would be the solution
[02:01:32] <anew> what
[02:01:39] <anew> cork that's going to confuse the hell out of him lol
[02:01:51] <anew> nancy with your ajax you send a call to server
[02:01:56] <anew> then you use json_decode
[02:02:00] <anew> to get what ajax is saying
[02:02:03] <anew> then you process
[02:02:05] <anew> and send back
[02:02:31] <anew> what cork said is confusing
[02:02:37] <anew> ajax and php can interact
[02:02:55] <Cork> anew: no, php can send ajax responses
[02:03:09] <Cork> but ajax can't EVER pass data to php on the page
[02:03:15] <anew> they can communicate .. .that's what he wants to know
[02:03:29] <anew> how can he get data from his db with ajax
[02:03:48] <anew> who's talking about on page ?
[02:03:52] <anew> he is sending data to his server
[02:04:08] <Cork> anew: " fetched json data into php so i can pass it to my php code"
[02:04:11] <anew> or is he talking about something else
[02:04:50] <anew> nancy what do you want to do
[02:05:08] <anew> because now i'm confused also lol
[02:23:18] <obert> how to add ajax to my site?
[02:26:35] <Cork> obert: can you elaborate on that question?
[02:28:22] <obert> Cork: i dont remember how to add ajax to a site in order to load only the content when the layout is similar to other pages
[02:36:03] <DarsVaeda> hi, when dragging a draggable onto a sortable on update the id of the draggable is not saved but deleted, is there a new behavior? in previous versions it worked
[02:36:23] <DarsVaeda> this has been a bug several times too :/
[02:39:01] <Cork> obert: that would be .load('url #id')
[02:39:03] <Cork> ?.load
[02:39:04] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[02:39:07] <Cork> ?.load 2
[02:39:08] <bot-t> Cork, Release:jQuery 1.2/Ajax - jQuery Wiki - http://docs.jquery.com/Release:jQuery_1.2/Ajax
[02:39:24] <Cork> bah i never remember how you got the second hit...
[02:39:39] <obert> ..
[02:39:44] <Cork> obert: anyway, that will still transfer the entire thing over the net though
[02:39:56] <Cork> so a better option is to actually create a partial server side
[02:40:14] <Cork> obert: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[02:40:23] <Cork> ex. $('#result').load('ajax/test.html #container');
[02:40:45] <agrach> .
[02:41:05] <obert> Cork: dunno, atm without js the site is good: you click on a menu item and you go there
[02:41:16] <obert> i would just to make it better :)
[02:41:22] <boytoy> At http://bit.ly/VR7Lt7 -- slideToggle's animation will crash my Android browser. Is this how I'd check if the user is on mobile so I can replace slideToggle() with show()? http://jsfiddle.net/2ScSQ/
[02:43:14] <Cork> boytoy: ua sniffing...
[02:43:17] <Cork> only way i know of
[02:43:56] <Cork> you COULD base it on the screen width, but... thats even worse
[02:44:55] <boytoy> hehe
[02:45:31] <boytoy> cool so http://jsfiddle.net/2ScSQ/ is an okay case for ua sniffing or u mean something hardcore like http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/ ?
[02:46:18] <obert> Cork: all that is made only via load?
[02:47:17] <Cork> obert: if you want to load a full page, and only load a section of it; yes
[02:48:02] <Cork> boytoy: ua sniffing isn't really every a good option, but sometimes there isn't really a good alternative
[02:48:21] <Cork> boytoy: a better option might be to only do it in mobile browsers you know crashes
[02:48:39] <Cork> and that filter won't catch all mobile browsers
[02:50:02] <boytoy> hmmm
[02:50:08] <boytoy> good point there Cork
[02:51:10] <obert> Cork: i will retry then
[02:51:46] <obert> the url should change normally, correct?
[02:52:29] <Cork> no
[02:52:41] <Cork> not if you override it with .load()
[02:52:57] <StephenS> I bought O'reilly jquery book! :)
[02:52:59] <StephenS> 30$ for it though :(
[02:54:24] <DarsVaeda> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.min.js
[02:54:37] <juha_> StephenS: which book?
[02:54:49] <StephenS> juha_ jquery
[02:54:59] <juha_> StephenS: yes, but which book
[02:55:07] <StephenS> cookbook http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596159788.do
[02:55:08] <juha_> StephenS: there's more than one book about jquery :P
[02:55:27] <juha_> isn't there any newer? that book is from 2009
[02:55:46] <StephenS> Nope
[02:55:57] <StephenS> well if I learn those basics I can easily upgrade to the new libs etc..
[02:56:03] <juha_> well, it's a good book but it's old
[02:56:49] <juha_> some things have changed since the book came out, but not too much so you should be fine with it
[02:56:56] <juha_> i enjoyed that
[03:02:38] <maxmoore14> need some help with jqm PLEASE - how do I pass a parameter between pages?
[03:16:49] <keirlav87> how do you reference an object from within itself if that makes sense?
[03:16:57] <DarsVaeda> can someone report a bug in jquery-ui for me? I don't have an account
[03:17:38] <keirlav87> like a = { prop: 'lol' , prop2 : this.prop }
[03:17:46] <pachet> keirlav87: you can't
[03:18:16] <pachet> var a = { }; a.prop = 2; a.prop2 = a.prop * 2;
[03:18:35] <pachet> var num = 2, a = { prop : num, prop2 : num * 2 };
[03:21:36] <keirlav87> thats a shame :/
[03:22:45] <gebbione> hi do you have any ideas why i cant get this jquery script to work? http://pastebin.com/h00fUyPn
[03:25:54] <gebbione> never seen a problem like this when trying to use jquery, also the property might be deprecated but it is the actual jquery causing errors even before getting used anywhere
[03:27:19] <keirlav87> try wrapping it in a doc ready tag
[03:27:49] <pachet> gebbione: $.browser is removed in 1.9
[03:31:50] <gebbione> pachet: do you think it is safe enough to use a browser plugin like this ? http://jquery.thewikies.com/browser/
[03:32:00] <gebbione> i just need to get the user agent ...
[03:32:17] <gebbione> it is not for feature detection else i would use supports
[03:33:47] <pachet> safe enough is a pretty broad designation
[03:33:49] <pachet> safe enough for what?
[03:35:56] <quicksilver> that plugin is written by someone who thinks that 536.26 is an integer.
[03:36:04] <quicksilver> that at least would give me pause....
[03:38:11] <keirlav87> ^ lol
[03:43:14] <monk3y> G'day everyone.  Need some experience/advice on the (now old?) IE/$(document).ready() timing issue.  Anyone here experienced it?
[03:43:40] <monk3y> Failing that, I'll settled for anyone that's simply awake and a good listener.  Heh.
[03:46:40] <dokma> can I always fetch the value of an attribute as was set by HTML even after it has been changed by js ?
[03:47:14] <gebbione> lol
[03:48:07] <monk3y> dokma: you should be able to, yes.  If you're fetching it with JS, then you should be able to retrieve changes made by JS.  It's all manipulating the live DOM.
[03:49:16] <dokma> monk3y: I'm trying to fetch the original value of the value attribute as was set by HTML after it was manipulated by jQ
[03:49:37] <dokma> monk3y: to reset it to the original
[03:49:42] <monk3y> Ah.  You omission of the word 'original' was completely critical to your question.
[03:49:58] <dokma> my bad
[03:50:15] <monk3y> And my omission of the letter 'r' after 'You' is completely critical to something my grade 10 english teacher said.
[03:50:26] <pachet> var foo = $('#foo'); foo.val(foo.attr('value'))
[03:50:29] <monk3y> But I forget what it was he was a douche.
[03:50:54] <pachet> dokma^
[03:51:23] <dokma> pachet: that will get the current manipulated value
[03:51:32] <monk3y> Yeah as pachet says; store the original attribute in an object before you change it.
[03:51:38] <monk3y> "before"
[03:51:40] <dokma> pachet: I'd like the original value as set by HTML before any jQ changes
[03:52:39] <quicksilver> you can't. It's gone now.
[03:52:48] <quicksilver> you'd have to save it before you changed it.
[03:52:59] <dokma> I see
[03:53:08] <dokma> perhaps .data ?
[03:53:20] <monk3y> Another way to do it is set the original value as an added attribute on the element, like a data-  . . .. uh.
[03:53:24] <monk3y> You beat me.
[03:53:29] <pachet> yall are tripping.
[03:53:41] <pachet> http://jsfiddle.net/MPZk9/
[03:53:46] * monk3y puts down his next acid-tab and raises his eyebrow at pachet
[03:54:19] <quicksilver> oh, you can then :)
[03:54:21] <pachet> read up on dom properties vs dom attributes ;{
[03:55:13] <monk3y> pachet: oooOOOOOoooooh.
[03:55:31] <pachet> dokma, again^
[03:55:45] <dokma> I've tried with attr but had problems
[03:55:49] <dokma> let me undo my code
[03:55:54] <monk3y> But dokma was saying he was going to change the attribute, didn't he?
[03:56:05] <monk3y> he/she
[03:56:22] <dokma> I was changing .val('something new')
[03:56:28] <dokma> and looking for a way to undo it
[03:56:31] <pachet> that's modifying the dom *property*
[03:56:57] <pachet> it's analogous to foo.prop('value', 'bar')
[03:58:00] <pachet> when the dom is built, those dom properties take their cues from the values of the corresponding attributes, if they exist
[03:58:06] <pachet> but the two do not stay in sync
[03:58:58] <dokma> pachet: do the attributes stay fixed?
[03:59:20] <monk3y> Yeah I know the difference between attributes and properties, but by the way dokma originally stated it, I thought the change was going to be foo.attr("value", newValue);
[04:00:24] <dokma> am I correct in thinking that DOM props are the dynamic stuff and attributes are what came from HTML?
[04:02:04] <pachet> dokma: in the case of inputs, they do
[04:02:05] <monk3y> Yes.
[04:02:23] <pachet> so document.getElementById('input_foo').getAttribute('value')
[04:02:36] <pachet> will always return the value of the attribute as it existed in the dom at creation
[04:02:52] <dokma> so attributes should be unchanged? when I do $('#id').attr('whatever') should always return the same?
[04:02:56] <pachet> it's synonymous with the .defaultValue property on that element
[04:03:23] <dokma> .getAttribute == .attr ??
[04:04:34] <pachet> dokma: no, not all attributes will remain unchanged
[04:04:39] <pachet> (unfortunately, i wish they did)
[04:04:45] <pachet> but we're talking about an input, right?
[04:04:59] <pachet> specifically input value=""?
[04:05:26] <monk3y> dokma: that's why I said before, it depends on how you're changing the attributes and/or properties.
[04:05:31] <dokma> alert(jQuery('#quoteRequestForm #name').defaultValue); gives undefined
[04:05:38] <dokma> it's an input type="text"
[04:05:59] <pachet> why do you have multiple id's in your selector
[04:06:05] <monk3y> dokma: not that it immediately solves your issue, but you only need the one ID.
[04:06:07] <monk3y> (#name)
[04:06:15] <dokma> I see
[04:06:17] <dokma> my bad
[04:06:17] <monk3y> Sorry, great minds.
[04:06:47] <pachet> dokma: also, jquery doesn't expose defaultValue as a property on the resultant $ object
[04:06:50] <pachet> you'd have to do
[04:06:55] <pachet> $('#name') [0].defaultValue
[04:08:36] <monk3y> Heh yeah, so you're dealing with HTML attributes, vs Javascript properties, vs jQuery properties/functions.
[04:10:19] <dokma> thanks
[04:10:26] <dokma> let me digest that and try a few things
[04:12:27] <monk3y> Without knowing more about how you could possibly change the HTML attributes or jQuery properties, I still feel the best design would be to persist the original attribute's value in an additional (data-?) attribute, just so it's there for clear reference.
[04:13:18] <monk3y> Because if you have many inputs that you're going to do this for, I wouldn't want to work with code that's keeping parallel objects for each and every input's original attribute/value.
[04:17:05] <anli> When I select in image in ckeditor, I want a menu item that is a checkbox, when I check the box, a class will be added to the <img>, how do I do that?
[04:48:55] <mazzachre> What is the best way to display html documents inside a framework? I have some divs displaying a menu and some tree navigation utility, currently the system specifies an iframe and just set the src on that element, but is that really the way forward?!
[04:55:30] <Cork> mazzachre: well you can actually embed it in the page
[04:55:35] <Cork> and use .load to include it
[04:55:41] <Cork> you might have to modify it a bit though
[04:56:11] <mazzachre> Hmmm... The pages are basically self-contained, so they can be loaded by themselves...
[04:56:38] <mazzachre> SO they contain stuff like included javascript and styles and headers etc...
[04:58:26] <Cork> ya, and that was the part i meant might need to be modified a bit
[04:58:35] <mazzachre> And modifying the documents are not an option :( There are too many to make it viable... Currently it uses old fashioned frames...
[04:58:46] <Cork> using ajax merge it into the normal page works a lot better if its possible
[04:59:05] <sirspazzolot> I'm looking at the docs for jQuery.event but I don't see one I would use for 'when a page creates a pop-up dialog'. can anyone point me in the right direction?
[04:59:07] <Cork> well then you don't really have an option :)
[04:59:33] <mazzachre> damned
[04:59:34] <Cork> sirspazzolot: there isn't an event for that
[04:59:56] <NeedSomeHelp> Hello, with this simple ajax call, how do I add an additional argument to the server? http://pastie.org/6150851
[05:00:04] <Cork> sirecote: jquery uses the native dom events, except for a few ones it fakes based on the native dom elements
[05:00:19] <Cork> like ready, mouseenter, mouseleave, hover
[05:00:36] <sirspazzolot> yeah, I figured. thanks Cork
[05:01:18] <Cork> NeedSomeHelp: http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#method-toArray
[05:01:29] <Cork> then just add your value to the array, and then pass it all to $.ajax
[05:03:52] <hxm> hello i have this $("#div").html("this is new"); and it works so nice, but instead "this is new" i want to change it for a <table> and some images
[05:04:00] <hxm> can i just put the code between "" safely?
[05:04:45] <NeedSomeHelp> Cork: dunno if that is an ideal solution, because the serial is a list of items to be sorted, while the extra argument I want to pass, is the id for the owner of the list. It doesnt really belong in that array.
[05:05:34] <Cork> NeedSomeHelp: i'm not sure what toArray returns, but i hope its similar to serializeArray()
[05:05:45] <Cork> NeedSomeHelp: and if it is its a list of key: values
[05:06:00] <Cork> so it should already be safe to use it for that
[05:06:19] <NeedSomeHelp> okay, thanks
[05:08:29] <boytoy> Cork did u say anything earlier without getting a reply from me? got disconnected
[05:09:11] <boytoy> if not please disregard my enquiry
[05:09:47] <Cork> boytoy: not that i know no
[05:10:27] <Cork> had to actually look :)
[05:11:56] <anli> Is there an event for ckeditors being initialized?
[05:12:00] <monk3y> Folks; I'm having reoccurring issues with jQuery1.8.3/document.ready()/IE8&9 firing it too soon to attach .on('click') to not-yet-rendered page elements.  So general Google'd advice suggests to wait for $(window).load.  Or use .on with delegation.  Anyone else experienced this?
[05:17:21] <superdo> hi, can I make a click event to a data attr?
[05:17:53] <monk3y> superdo: I think you're missing some words there.  When you click - what do you want to happen?  You want to change the data attr?
[05:18:27] <superdo> no, read its content, but also use it for listening click event
[05:18:38] <superdo> just curious
[05:19:21] <monk3y> Sure, change/read whatever.  But I'm not sure what you mean by 'listening for click event'.  You .. you want the attribute to listen for a click event?
[05:20:11] <monk3y> I think what you want is for the attribute's element (the element containing the attribute) to have an .on('click'..) bound to it.
[05:20:26] <superdo> normally u use $('.button').click( ..  so you need a class for that
[05:20:36] <monk3y> Or element-name.  Or #id.
[05:20:41] <superdo> oc
[05:20:57] <anli> Is it possible to add something to the ckeditor toolbar that is not a button?
[05:21:13] <quicksilver> perhaps you meant $('[data-foo=bar]').on('click',....)
[05:21:27] <quicksilver> bind a handler to all elements who have a certain data value
[05:21:34] <superdo> yes
[05:21:50] <monk3y> So; $("[data-attr]").on-  guh.
[05:21:55] <superdo> :)
[05:21:58] <monk3y> quicksilver beat me to it.
[05:22:08] <superdo> thanks both :)
[05:22:18] <quicksilver> that only works for data attributes set up in the actual HTML source, not things you might set yourself with .data(), of course.
[05:22:48] <monk3y> (but would work with object.attr("data-foo", value), etc)
[05:22:48] <superdo> yes php generates it
[05:24:47] <mazzachre> So, the newest update to jsfiddle finally made it completely incompatible with IE8 ?
[05:26:43] <jeturcotte> So, has anyone ever encountered jQuery misbehaviors in the same scope as a regex match success?
[05:47:19] <ow1n> Is it possible for a jQueryUI tooltip to load content from another element besides the title attribute?
[05:48:23] <StephenS> owin yes
[05:48:51] <ow1n> StephenS: Do you know of a good example I can look at?
[05:49:23] <ow1n> I'm afraid the documentation is just confusing me
[05:49:45] <StephenS> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-ui-tooltips-require-a-title-tag
[05:51:46] <anli> I want to add custom html to the ckeditor toolbar, is that possible?
[05:51:56] <anli> I also want it to interact with the document
[05:53:35] <ow1n> StephenS (or anyone else), what does it mean in this section, http://api.jqueryui.com/tooltip/#option-items, "When changing this option, you likely need to also change the content option."
[05:54:12] <StephenS> Don't ask me, I just bought a book :)
[05:54:18] <anli> :)
[05:55:43] <ow1n> It says the reverse in the description of the content option, but still doesn't include an example where both are used together :(
[06:01:36] <ow1n> Thanks for the example StephenS, that helped. I think the items option was a red herring in my case.
[06:01:38] <jeturcotte> what would be a good way to test 'this' to see if it has changed during the course of a given scope… I ask because at the beginning of the scope it is obviously a jQuery object with a paragraph tag context… but after a regex returns some matches, all jquery functions on 'this' just go away… but when i alert(this['context']) it still says it's a paragraph tag
[06:01:56] <ow1n> anli: Isn't your question more of a ckeditor one than a jquery one?
[06:02:43] <jeturcotte> i ask because it still appears to be a jquery object, and yet (despite there being no errors) it stops functioning as one
[06:02:56] <jeturcotte> (well, error WARNINGs that is)
[06:04:03] <jeturcotte> so i was wondering people people have some customary way of testing to see if it has changed in any significant way while still appearing to be what it was before the incident
[06:04:39] <jeturcotte> i suppose i could check to see if .html still exists? since that's what is failing
[06:04:41] <ajpiano> jeturcotte: the scope of a function can't change inside the body of a funciton
[06:04:50] <ajpiano> unless you are inside of another function scope
[06:04:53] <ajpiano> inside of the first function
[06:05:40] <ajpiano> jeturcotte: you would be well served to paste some code
[06:05:46] <ajpiano> ?demo
[06:05:47] <b-ot> ajpiano: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:05:47] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:05:53] <jeturcotte> ajpiano , something is happening… we enter the function and this inherits the jquery object… I check a few things… run a regex… go on to use this to manipulate the contents of said paragraph tag… but in any instance of this where the regex actually returns a match, the jquery object ceased to be useful
[06:06:01] <jeturcotte> done
[06:06:02] <jeturcotte> http://jsfiddle.net/kXTCJ/8/
[06:06:17] <ajpiano> jeturcotte: rest assured that the description "something is happening" can be used to describe any problem, ever
[06:06:19] <ajpiano> :)
[06:06:40] <jeturcotte> steps to replicate… click on the typing box, type in something like :em: and continue typing… you'll see the regex returns but the .html() based on it does nothing
[06:07:45] <jeturcotte> when i've tested this after the regex or in the if(nt){}, it still SAYS it is one and yet calling any jquery function it results in nothing at all
[06:08:08] <ajpiano> jeturcotte: what are you using to debug this aside from alert statements
[06:08:42] <jeturcotte> outside of jsfiddle, I watch the inspector in safari, but not really any more than that
[06:08:51] <jeturcotte> it does all this without raising any warnings
[06:08:56] <anli> ow1n: Have you been into the #ckeditor channel lately?
[06:09:22] <ajpiano> jeturcotte: are you familiar with using the `console` methods for debugging instead of alert?
[06:09:31] <jeturcotte> yip
[06:09:37] <ajpiano> jeturcotte: what am i supposed to type into this box to trigger the regex
[06:09:58] <jeturcotte> any thing between :and: will trigger it after the next keystroke
[06:10:02] <jeturcotte> it looks for :something: at the end
[06:11:14] <jeturcotte> in theory it would then rewrite the content without the :something: (and save 'something' for later use)
[06:11:26] <jeturcotte> but whenever a match is found, jquery goes to lunch
[06:11:55] <jeturcotte> or appears to anyways… no doubt its just me doing somethign wrong… but i don't have a feel just quite for what
[06:12:28] <anli> Seems like I have to write a hack to get something else than buttons in the ckeditor toolbar
[06:12:33] <ajpiano> why are you using a <p> as an <input>
[06:12:46] <jeturcotte> because i feel like it =3
[06:13:03] <ajpiano> do you have a better reason than that?
[06:13:13] <jeturcotte> don't need a better reason
[06:13:17] <jeturcotte> this is play
[06:13:28] <jeturcotte> experimentation, learning, et cetera
[06:13:48] <ajpiano> jeturcotte: why aren't you using contenteditable in that case
[06:13:56] <jeturcotte> i'd have to have heard of it
[06:14:07] <ajpiano> perhaps you should take a gander before reinventing the wheel
[06:14:24] <jeturcotte> reinventing wheels is a good way to fully appreciate how they function
[06:14:29] <jeturcotte> but yeah, i'll take a look
[06:15:24] <jeturcotte> a library?
[06:15:46] <ajpiano> jeturcotte: http://html5doctor.com/the-contenteditable-attribute/
[06:16:21] <jeturcotte> ah, not the first result that came up; ended up at a github project chock full of js and php
[06:17:11] <jeturcotte> that is a nice feature; so it's core html5 then
[06:17:36] <ajpiano> yes
[06:17:47] <jeturcotte> *bow* a definite improvement
[06:18:05] <jeturcotte> stashed in my reading stack, thanks
[06:18:20] <jeturcotte> though i'd still like to know precisely whats happening that, post-regex, jquery takes a hike
[06:18:39] <jeturcotte> well, in circumstances where there are no matches, it operates as usual
[06:18:52] <jeturcotte> so its not the operation itself that does (or appears to do) anything
[06:19:12] <the_dark1knight> Hi, I want to validate date() in jquery like mysql's date(). I want to check if ('2013-02-14' > today's date (i.e. '2013-02-14')) as the jquery's date() gives the whole date like 13 th Feb 2013 and then time, I am not able to do it. please help.
[06:20:23] <otherj> what have you tried?
[06:22:27] <lejocelyn> is there a way to do a step by step debugging a javascript ?
[06:22:38] <ajpiano> ?ftj @ lejocelyn
[06:22:38] <bot-t> lejocelyn, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[06:22:51] <ajpiano> lejocelyn: yes it is built into your browser's dev tools
[06:22:55] <lejocelyn> I'd like to know why a function works in some cases, and not on other :D
[06:23:52] <jeturcotte> data/argument flaws can frequently cause that kind of thing
[06:24:21] <jeturcotte> kinda like asking why a person can eat a tomato and not nightshade
[06:24:50] <quicksilver> are you suggesting eating nightshade as a way to debug javascript?
[06:25:06] <ajpiano> jeturcotte: it's not that .html() "isn't working"
[06:25:28] <ajpiano> it's that the code on line 43 *still* executes
[06:25:36] <ajpiano> *after* you've removed the :foo: part
[06:25:38] <ajpiano> so it puts it back in
[06:26:00] <monk3y> Back in the days of DHTML I used a night-shade to debug.  Gave me full stack-tracing and object-watching.
[06:26:05] <jeturcotte> you're right
[06:26:11] <jeturcotte> content itself hasn't been modified
[06:26:17] <jeturcotte> *bo*
[06:26:32] <jeturcotte> it would be something obtuse like that
[06:26:33] <ajpiano> jeturcotte: you gotta step debug and pause your code as it executes :)
[06:26:49] <jeturcotte> i did a bit, but i was focusing entirely around the regex
[06:27:41] <jeturcotte> heee
[06:27:43] <jeturcotte> thanks
[06:28:10] <jeturcotte> and yeah, to the other person, I'm just giving a metaphor as to how feeding a function (human) with one thing versus another can have different results
[06:29:13] <jeturcotte> on that note, tomatoes are in the nightshade family … and everything except the fruit itself is considered toxic to eat
[06:29:17] <ajpiano> jeturcotte: i reckon lejocelyn knows that, and just wanted to know if it's possible to step debug the code in order to diagnose that problem
[06:29:18] <jeturcotte> so it may be a bad example
[06:30:14] <lejocelyn> ajpiano: you're right, I was wondering about the actually tools people use to debug their works with JS
[06:30:22] <ajpiano> right
[06:30:22] <lejocelyn> coming from Python
[06:30:29] <ajpiano> lejocelyn: take a look at the presentation i linked you to
[06:30:43] <dokma> how do I fetch the object from inside the focus handler? $('#id').focus(someFunc);
[06:30:51] <dokma> I need to fetch the #id from someFunc
[06:30:53] <jeturcotte> heh, yeah… our python daemons suffer from this kind of thing all the time (needs unit testing)
[06:31:24] <ajpiano> dokma: someFunc(e) { e.target.id } or this.id
[06:31:24] <lejocelyn> like, is it possible to get, step by step, what an function is doing, when clicking on the object that activates it ?
[06:31:29] <lejocelyn> I look at the presentationb
[06:31:56] <ajpiano> lejocelyn: not without having first set a breakpoint
[06:32:06] <dokma> ajpiano: thank you! let me try
[06:37:38] <banisterfiend> hi what's the best way to use the HTML5 history API?
[06:38:38] <melter> there's a spelling error on jqueryui.com: "progresbar" should be "progressbar" in the "What's New in jQuery UI 1.10?" section
[06:39:29] <Gho5t> better file a bug report
[06:40:24] <ajpiano> melter: thx
[06:41:59] <adavia> can anybody help me with this fiddle.. im trying to remove each input field after is being added to the list.. also need to make it remove when the employee input is empty http://jsfiddle.net/uY5Gh/3/
[06:42:56] <ajpiano> melter: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/commit/54986330f0d7e1b7f1aa730f6e0a78f08aad6360
[06:42:56] <b-ot> ajpiano: adam j. sontag (26s): Fix typo in 'progressbar' on home page
[06:42:58] <ajpiano> just fixed it
[06:43:04] <ajpiano> will go live in next site push
[06:43:13] <ajpiano> thx for the report, you don't need to bother filing anything else :)
[06:43:15] <jeturcotte> ajpiano++
[06:44:39] <Kingsy> something like this --> http://jsfiddle.net/aGCzZ/ <-- I assume the alert() is being executed right after the delay because the fade is executing async, and because the delay() is being executed on the same object that is async too..
[06:45:13] <Kingsy> I want to add a delay BEFORE the alert but after the fade... is this possible?
[06:45:56] <Kingsy> I am basically trying to get some control over execution order.
[06:47:51] <Kingsy> nm I guess I will just go back to setTimeout
[06:48:17] <Gho5t> you need to specify a callback
[06:48:20] <Gho5t> in the fadeout
[06:48:43] <Gho5t> you're right it is async
[06:50:00] <Gho5t> Kingsy: http://jsfiddle.net/aGCzZ/2/
[06:53:27] <seutje> what the
[06:54:12] <melter> ajpiano: thanks :)
[07:00:25] <teadict> So... I'm getting this in a contact form body:jQuery161025000936072319746_1360412299990. Can't track where it's getting added
[07:00:33] <teadict> Anyone recognize that string?
[07:01:11] <melfy> crazy looks like timestamp
[07:01:21] <seutje> looks like the internal ID
[07:01:36] <seutje> think u can also see those when inspecting in IE
[07:03:07] <teadict> mmm, I still don't know where it's comming from
[07:03:18] <teadict> what could be happening in the contact form?
[07:03:26] <teadict> some plugin adding crap?
[07:03:41] <seutje> ?expando
[07:03:47] <bot-t> seutje, #9923 (Warning: reference to undefined property a[f.expando ... - Opened 19 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9923
[07:07:48] <dokma> monk3y, pachet, ajpiano: thanks for your help... all works fine now. you can take a look and let me know if I made some other stupid mistakes: http://www.prijevodi-online.net/typo3conf/ext/evtranslate/res/evtranslate.js
[07:10:16] <monk3y> That's good news, dokma.  However I'd like to warn that I just had a lot of issues with using $(document).ready() for my site, when rendered in IE.
[07:11:14] <dokma> monk3y: how did you fix it?
[07:11:47] <monk3y> dokma: It seemed a specific group of users; using the public site but from their corporate network, would hit my page, but a lot of the times the .on('click')'s and $("input").infieldlabel() stuff I was trying to fire - wouldn't 'take'.
[07:12:10] <monk3y> It turns out that IE 8 & 9 "seemed" to be firing document.ready before any of the HTML elements were 'down', so they wouldn't attach.
[07:12:47] <monk3y> The fix was to replace document.ready with window.load; so the binds would only happen once the whole page (HTML, images, scripts) were all down.
[07:12:48] <dokma> the legacy of IE6 survives
[07:13:18] <dokma> I'll just do that right away...
[07:13:32] <monk3y> So just advising you might want to be careful with your document.ready and expecting certain elements to be there.  Read up jQuery's docs on .on and delegation, to attach to 'document' and hopefully catch bubbling.
[07:14:10] <monk3y> Yeah; either use window.load (unsure of cross-browser fitness at this time), or use .on with delegation, so that binds attach to existing *and* future elements as and when they're rendered.
[07:14:50] <StephenS> What is the best Timeout for jquery, I mean to not crash server etc..
[07:14:51] <dokma> thanks once more
[07:16:16] <webguest> Help! i want to make a toggle action on a click, but 1 function should not be called: http://paste2.org/p/2859274
[07:16:40] <webguest> it's bouncing after a click, it will show/hide 3 times in 1 click....
[07:17:17] <lejocelyn> ajpiano: wahoo, firebug is awesome :) thanks for the link
[07:17:25] <lejocelyn> a bit heavy though
[07:17:43] <Gho5t> not really
[07:19:26] <webguest> Help! i want to make a toggle action on a click, but 1 function should not be called: http://paste2.org/p/2859274
[07:21:27] <webguest> got it, had to remove Click...
[07:22:46] <Kingsy> take the following code --> http://pastie.org/6152383 <-- it works just great, but the timeout doesnt seem to reset, if you execute it once every couple of seconds its great, if you execute it 20 times in a second the timeout doesnt seem to be resetting and it therefore doesnt execute as expected.. can someone see a problem with the code?
[07:24:08] <CannabisToke> anyone have an idea on how to find local programmers
[07:24:22] <Kingsy> its basically just suppsed to fadeout, then back in after the timer.. if you execute the statement alot of times fast, it basically just flashes from 0 - 1 opacity in an instant, the fade doesnt get executed.
[07:24:53] <ajpiano> lejocelyn: yeah, most people use chrome dev tools in my experience
[07:24:57] <ajpiano> nowadays at least
[07:25:29] <Surkow|laptop> most people?
[07:25:30] <Surkow|laptop> :P
[07:25:49] <Surkow|laptop> all people I worked with still use firebug
[07:26:10] <anli> I am adding a toolbar item in ckeditor using http://pastebin.com/UfQNSUU0 but, how can I get access to the dom thats added with output.push(html)?
[07:26:44] <Surkow|laptop> hmm
[07:27:05] <Surkow|laptop> just wrote a nice slideshow crossfade effect
[07:27:25] <Surkow|laptop> but all functions that are in a .js file can't read from the window variables
[07:27:29] <Surkow|laptop> any way to overcome this?
[07:28:03] <Surkow|laptop> I now simply pass an image array by value
[07:31:50] <Kingsy> ok this is a better example --> http://jsfiddle.net/jBWgL/ <-- clicking the box turns it white (opaque) it then waits for the timeout, and fades to black.. if you click it multiple times it stays black, I would want it to stay white, it so be setting opacity to 0 and waiting for the timeout each time its executed.
[07:31:58] <Kingsy> can someone offer some guidence on that?
[07:33:18] <Surkow|laptop> interesting bug
[07:33:47] * Kingsy nods
[07:34:22] <Surkow|laptop> eventually you can click it again
[07:34:40] <Kingsy> yeah the timeout seems to catch up.. but that doesnt help.. someone could abuse it and break the functionality
[07:35:04] <Surkow|laptop> hmm
[07:39:20] <Gho5t> Kingsy: you are aware that you can chain animations right
[07:39:38] <Gho5t> are you just trying to fade the box out and then fade it back in/
[07:39:51] <Kingsy> Gho5t: I wasnt no.. :P but if this is the case, how do I prevent that?
[07:40:00] <Gho5t> first rewrite this
[07:40:06] <Kingsy> Gho5t: yes, but it has to use either visibility or opacity
[07:40:10] <guidobouman> Ladies & Gents, I;m working on a plugin, but are having some issues with custom events.
[07:40:23] <Kingsy> it cant use display types because of what it plugs into
[07:40:49] <guidobouman> $.event.handle got removed in jQuery 1.9.1 what alternative should I use?
[07:41:20] <Kingsy> Gho5t: and yeah, it just needs to fade in and out, when its plugged into the rest of the code the contents of that box changes. the fade is for effect.
[07:41:39] <davemo> Kingsy: you could use a throttle to solve that problem
[07:41:40] <davemo> http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#throttle
[07:41:52] <Gho5t> Kingsy: 1 sec
[07:42:04] <Gho5t> jsfiddle sucks
[07:42:09] <Gho5t> .$("#zoom1").bind('click', $("#zoom1"), function (event) {
[07:42:11] <Gho5t>     $("#zoom1").fadeOut('slow').fadeTo(800, 1);
[07:42:13] <Gho5t> });
[07:42:22] <Gho5t> http://jsfiddle.net/jBWgL/1/
[07:42:25] <superdo> anyone met Ckeditor typeerror: b is undefined ?
[07:43:21] <Kingsy> Gho5t: um, that doesnt nothing...
[07:43:47] <Gho5t> probably because you're not even using document.ready
[07:43:48] <Kingsy> Gho5t: oh, and the fade out and fade in have to be seperate statement
[07:43:59] <Gho5t> why
[07:44:15] <Kingsy> Gho5t: because in the final code it needs to do things inbetween
[07:44:31] <Gho5t> like after the first animation ends?
[07:44:38] <Kingsy> yeah
[07:44:43] <Gho5t> again
[07:44:46] <Gho5t> you can use a callback
[07:45:08] <Kingsy> I couldnt get it working with a callback, so I just used a delay
[07:45:08] <Gho5t>  $("#zoom1").fadeOut('slow', function(){ alert("I'm done"); });
[07:45:13] <Gho5t> read the docs
[07:46:34] <Kingsy> Gho5t: that doesnt help, its not the fade that I am trying to control.. Its a delay on the FadeIn animation.. it needs to wait before it executes it
[07:46:56] <Kingsy> I don't need to know when the fade as executed, I need to tell it to execute after a period of time.
[07:47:16] <Gho5t> ok
[07:47:23] <Gho5t> you said after the first animation ends
[07:47:28] <Gho5t> you didn't say at a fixed time
[07:47:48] <keirlav87> use .delay to delay execution
[07:47:52] <Kingsy> Gho5t: ah I am sorry.. I am pretty crap at explaining myself.
[07:47:54] <Gho5t> right
[07:48:00] <keirlav87> .delay(ms)
[07:48:03] <Gho5t> I still don't see why you need a timeout in this
[07:48:32] <Kingsy> its to delay the effect of the fade in to allow of a library to init that doesnt support a callback
[07:48:43] <Kingsy> s/of//
[07:48:57] <Kingsy> its a hack until I get a better library
[07:49:12] <Kingsy> well I say library, I mean "extension"
[07:52:14] <Kingsy> Gho5t: I got it
[07:52:40] <monteith> does anybody have any recommendations for lightweight touch/swipe library? just need an ios like motion for left/right slides.
[07:52:55] <Kingsy> The guys in javascript helped as I thought it was a setTimeout problem.
[07:53:07] <Kingsy> turns out I needed to stop the animation too :D
[07:54:01] <Gho5t> ok bud
[07:54:04] <Gho5t> you're still doing it wrong
[07:54:06] <Gho5t> but enjoy
[07:55:06] <adavia> can anybody help me with this fiddle.. im trying to remove each input field after is being added to the list.. also need to make it remove when the employee input is empty http://jsfiddle.net/uY5Gh/3/
[07:56:17] <Kingsy> Gho5t: yeah I know, this isnt ideal at all, I just couldnt get a callback working with the exension... at all.. I will take another look later on, its just better to get a hack working than it being broken :D
[07:56:44] <Gho5t> okie dokie
[08:00:25] <Tixz> adavia: Can you explain further? I'm looking at your code now and have reindented it
[08:01:45] <guidobouman> $.event.handle got removed in jQuery 1.9.1 what alternative should I use?
[08:01:47] <Tixz> adavia: I'd probably also use more schematic elements than all divs
[08:03:15] <adavia> Tixz:  actually for some reason im not able to add the corresponded input the first time i add an employee
[08:04:11] <Tixz> adavia: Arr you're trying to do an autocomplete that then reveals further inputs?
[08:04:13] <adavia> Tixz:  yes i know im looking forward to improve that code
[08:05:07] <adavia> Tixz:  id_employee would be a hidden field.. but im using text to test the code
[08:05:13] <Tixz> alright
[08:05:20] <Tixz> And then what isn't working?
[08:06:10] <adavia> Tixz:  you can check in the example that starts working the second time you add an employee
[08:06:26] <Tixz> Arr
[08:06:32] <Tixz> Yeah, let me have another look
[08:07:57] <boytoy> At http://jsfiddle.net/VmG4Q/ -- using slideToggle() to show different sections of a site -- how to show only one section at a time?
[08:08:00] <boytoy> Say if you've already clicked "Test 1" and then click "Test 2", then first slide "Test 1" back up etc.
[08:09:05] <Tixz> adavia: Well, you have multiple elements with the same id, that's bad
[08:09:07] <Tixz> really bad
[08:09:27] <Tixz> And probably why your code isn't working
[08:11:16] <adavia> Tixz:  just id="id_employee" name="id_employee[]
[08:11:34] <adavia> Tixz:  but that is not affecting the code
[08:11:53] <Tixz> Yep, but you clone that element several times :)
[08:12:14] <Tixz> then you should just stick with a class if you want to reuse that id
[08:12:17] <adavia> Tixz:  thats the idea
[08:12:41] <Tixz> your nab attr is correct if you want it interpreted as an array
[08:13:00] <adavia> Tixz:  thats what i need
[08:14:05] <adavia> the problem is that is not adding the field the first time i select an employee
[08:14:53] <Tixz> You clone it right away though
[08:14:54] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone advise on how this is done, it appears to be all JS? Is it a package or completely custom coded? http://bit.ly/12yJhCc
[08:16:50] <kaylee> so I have a page with a multiselect form, on change I make an ajax call which ends up adding additional multi select fields, which are also using .on('change'.. to make additional ajax calls
[08:17:28] <kaylee> what I don't understand, is when the page first loads, when I make a selection it does one ajax call, like it should
[08:17:43] <kaylee> but the more I click around the more requests it makes on each click… which it shouldn't
[08:18:28] <kaylee> any suggestions on where to start looking to track that down?
[08:18:36] <shoky> kaylee: sounds like you're adding event handlers for elements that you already added event handlers to
[08:19:08] <pachet> dawg
[08:19:20] <shoky> ;p
[08:19:33] <kaylee> hum… will check on that
[08:19:33] <kaylee> thanks
[08:19:46] <pachet> kaylee: find wherever it is that you're binding that event handler
[08:19:54] <Tixz> adavia: http://jsfiddle.net/uY5Gh/9/
[08:20:00] <pachet> and call .off('change.mynamespace').on('change.mynamespace', function(){})
[08:20:14] <pachet> or just set it up so you dont bind multiple times in the first place
[08:20:17] <pachet> eg with delegation
[08:20:33] <boytoy> Can you guys help me out with something real basic? At http://jsfiddle.net/VmG4Q/ -- using slideToggle() to show different sections of a site -- how to show only one section at a time? So say you've already clicked "Test 1" and then click "Test 2", how to slide "Test 1" back up etc.?
[08:22:28] <adavia> Tixz:  still not working the first time you add an employee..
[08:23:10] <kaylee> ooooh
[08:23:10] <Tixz> adavia: It is here... http://jsfiddle.net/uY5Gh/10/
[08:23:16] <kaylee> I think I just figured out my problem
[08:23:33] <Tixz> But I think your code is pretty bad in the first place :p Maybe you should just start over and get a fresh perspective on it...
[08:23:59] <Tixz> It's not that much code anyway, and this isn't the direction I'd choose if you're doing that I think you are
[08:25:17] <adavia> Tixz:  yes i check in your fiddle but not.. when you add an employee for the first time and you type something is not being moved to the list
[08:25:48] <Tixz> adavia: I think you should take a look at Select2
[08:25:53] <adavia> Tixz:  what can i do.. thats the only solution it came out
[08:25:56] <Tixz> That seems to what you're doing
[08:30:12] <liox_> someone knows the plugin smoothdivscroll?
[08:30:12] <AdamPDotty> okay, who let the cow loose?
[08:32:18] <shoky> boytoy:  first of all you're missing a </div> to close #two
[08:32:31] <shoky> boytoy: 2nd, http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/VmG4Q/1/
[08:33:29] <liox_> someone could help me with a problem I'm using the plugin?
[08:34:46] <liox_> the first time it is loaded it fails to calculate the area of the images only from the second run.
[08:35:41] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone advise on how this is done, it appears to be all JS? Is it a package or completely custom coded? http://bit.ly/12yJhCc
[08:35:48] <Brodingo> liox_ likely because the images are cached
[08:36:27] <Brodingo> liox_ not sure what you're doing but it may need to be in the $(window).load() function instead of document ready
[08:37:00] <guidobouman> $this.trigger(event); did just fine in case anyone wondered
[08:37:02] <liox_> Brodingo: to view look at the problem http://oggiambientes.com/novo/ click the Environments menu and click on an image, reload the page and then click again n same image
[08:37:08] <liox_> menu Ambientes
[08:40:08] <boytoy> shoky: kewl
[08:40:13] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: it appears to be custom coded..
[08:40:41] <fRAiLtY-> shoky:  It's clever, it's jquery?
[08:41:17] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: yep. which part impresses you, maybe im looking at the wrong part ;p
[08:41:45] <boytoy> shoky: that was _beautiful_ man
[08:41:49] <fRAiLtY-> The "design tool" part
[08:41:59] <shoky> seems pretty simple..
[08:42:01] <fRAiLtY-> How you can effectively create a mini Adobe Indesign with html 5
[08:42:12] <liox_> Brodingo: could view?
[08:42:15] <shoky> i've done similar things
[08:42:29] <Brodingo> liox_ not really sure what the problem is
[08:42:53] <fRAiLtY-> shoky:  So that implementation is HTML5 canvas and JS right?
[08:43:04] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: no it's just divs and imgs
[08:43:11] <shoky> and JS, of course
[08:43:23] <shoky> no <canvas> there
[08:43:25] <fRAiLtY-> And the "dragging" part?
[08:43:30] <shoky> jquery-ui ?
[08:43:37] <fRAiLtY-> How you can drag elements and snap to an imaginary grid?
[08:43:50] <shoky> and anyway...  implementing dragging yourself is pretty simple
[08:44:02] <shoky> it's not imaginary in code..
[08:44:22] <fRAiLtY-> No, it's just the first time I've seen anything like that non-flash
[08:44:26] <shoky> really?
[08:44:32] <fRAiLtY-> Personally, yeah
[08:44:37] <fRAiLtY-> You have any other examples?
[08:44:50] <shoky> mmm
[08:44:50] <fRAiLtY-> I only stumbled across it because they're a competitor :D
[08:46:14] <shoky> well first of all.. http://jqueryui.com/draggable/#snap-to
[08:46:24] <systemfault> Everyone's happy with Opera switching to webkit? :P
[08:47:49] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: i donno.. google docs has similar stuff. im not good with examples, im sure there are much more impressive shit
[08:51:08] <Tsd_> hi @all
[08:51:16] <Tsd_> just a little question
[08:51:20] <pachet> fRAiLtY-: it's just math
[08:51:36] <pachet> on your mousemove handler, you round the position of the dragged element to the nearest (grid size)
[08:51:43] <Tsd_> i inject a page dynamically into my jqm
[08:51:47] <Tsd_> it works
[08:52:08] <Tsd_> but my buttons at the header bar are not rendered
[08:52:43] <Tsd_> i just want to ask if there is another possibility than rerender them manually with $(id).button();
[08:52:56] <Tsd_> i do page.page() after inject my content
[08:53:14] <Tsd_> but it doesn't works at the buttons
[08:54:10] <liox_> can anyone help me please?
[08:54:49] <liox_> I would like to show the problem so you can help me
[08:56:14] <BillCriswell> liox_: Wait till the document is fully loaded before running the script. It's probably only working on the second reload due to caching.
[08:58:11] <fRAiLtY-> shoky:  How does it achieve the image adding and text editing capabilities?
[08:58:57] <Tsd_> do anybody has an idea??
[08:59:02] <Tsd_> of my problem
[09:00:18] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: for uploading the image it's using http://www.plupload.com/
[09:01:51] <shoky> fRAiLtY-:  and the edited elements are being rendered dynamically on the server-side, i think
[09:03:37] <shoky> each element individually, that is
[09:03:44] <fRAiLtY-> cool
[09:22:29] <lejocelyn> how to select all the <input /> that match a regular expression ?
[09:22:57] <lejocelyn> how to select all the input with an id that match a regular expression ?
[09:22:58] <lejocelyn> :D
[09:23:02] <systemfault> Is it possible to select it without? ;)
[09:23:32] <pallet> Hi there, whats the javascript version of $_GET['oauth_token']
[09:23:54] <systemfault> pallet: None, you have to parse the querystring yourself.
[09:24:32] <systemfault> You can access it with location.search.slice(1) IIRC
[09:24:51] <pallet> ah ok
[09:24:52] <pallet> thanks
[09:25:28] <gnarf> lejocelyn: i would suggest against doing it
[09:25:42] <gnarf> lejocelyn: attribute starts with selector
[09:25:47] <gnarf> is prolly the closest you get
[09:25:54] <gnarf> lejocelyn: whats the regexp you want to match?
[09:26:36] <lejocelyn> gnarf: systemfault: I've got an add button for a form that clone an input but change the id attribute (add +1 to it). I'd like to create a button to remove the last input form the user add, so I thought I should match all the input with the attribut I want, except the +1, and remove the one with the highest number
[09:27:18] <BillCriswell> lejocelyn: You can use $('.item:last').remove()
[09:27:33] <gnarf> lejocelyn: i would make each item in a container with a class then do what BillCriswell suggests
[09:28:09] <systemfault> I guess you could do something like input[id^="theid-"]:last  :X
[09:28:35] <lejocelyn> sounds like not the best thin to do
[09:28:38] <lejocelyn> thing
[09:28:45] <gnarf> yeah, use classes
[09:28:48] <gnarf> it makes it easier
[09:28:49] <gnarf> :)
[09:29:07] <lejocelyn> gnarf: can't use classes for individual input
[09:29:28] <lejocelyn> ah
[09:29:29] <lejocelyn> got it
[09:29:38] <lejocelyn> sorry, I began javascript not long ago
[09:32:51] <lejocelyn> BillCriswell: by the way, what's this the ":" ? .item:last
[09:33:15] <adavia> can anybody give me an idea on how can i send the data being added in the list.. http://jsfiddle.net/uY5Gh/11/
[09:33:17] <BillCriswell> lejocelyn: It's a special jQuery thinger that grabs the last element.
[09:33:35] <lejocelyn> last element of what ?
[09:33:56] <lejocelyn> I mean, the user can add an input anywhere in the form
[09:35:15] <lejocelyn> last in term of, the last one in the DOM ?
[09:36:03] <systemfault> lejocelyn: The last one of the matched elements?
[09:36:26] <lil-murph> If i use $.getScript to load a script and it fails to load, can I get the full exception w/ the line number?
[09:38:29] <computer2000> ot but please anyone can help me: ive embedded a html5 video (with webm, ogv, mp4 in this order) into a page and it works on all browsers except firefox keeps saying it needs an extra plugin installed to show video properly, although it runs fine...
[09:46:30] <BillCriswell> lejocelyn: http://jsbin.com/oyuzek/1/edit quick example I came up with for you.
[09:46:36] <BillCriswell> Ah, they left.
[09:46:51] <Surkow|laptop> nobody is patient enough
[09:46:51] <Surkow|laptop> ;)
[09:46:56] <Surkow|laptop> hmm
[09:47:02] <Surkow|laptop> anybody experience with crossfading?
[09:47:12] <Surkow|laptop> http://surkow.dyndns.org/wcg/
[09:47:20] <Surkow|laptop> I built a testcase
[09:47:35] <Surkow|laptop> images are getting precached
[09:48:03] <Surkow|laptop> I'm using two images and I'm replacing the src and then crossfading between the two images
[09:48:29] <Surkow|laptop> in firefox there is a noticeable jump from the first picture to the second
[09:48:43] <Surkow|laptop> anyone seeing the same?
[09:51:19] <travalas> hi, i've noticed that my textfields don't submit, is there something i have to do with javascript to enable that?
[09:51:45] <NoiseEee> travalas: don't submit in a normal form post? do they have name attributes?
[09:51:48] <jrockjiggz> Surkow|laptop: i experienced the same jump in chrome as in firefox
[09:51:54] <Surkow|laptop> hmm
[09:52:06] <BillCriswell> travalas: It has to be inside the form and have a name.
[09:52:15] <travalas> ahh maybe i didn't give it a name
[09:52:20] <travalas> just an id
[09:53:56] <travalas> that was it! i know it was something simple!
[09:57:59] <jackjackw> guys i have http://jackw411.co.uk/syrup/index.html - twitter feed at the bottom, how do i implement jScrollpane so that it works with this twitter plug-in?
[09:58:21] <jackjackw> because just applying it to the div in question does nothing, and makes the scroller disappear completely :s
[10:02:50] <gordian> guys i'm having an issue with getting my nivo slider to work in IE8
[10:02:52] <gordian> site is at http://goo.gl/pXmiO
[10:03:14] <gordian> error is "Object doesn't support this property or method" Line 79 Char 2
[10:03:26] <gordian> googled for a while and nothing turned up
[10:03:34] <gordian> any guidance would be much appreciated
[10:05:43] <eedfwchris> Hey guys… is it generally frowned upon to put scripts inline even if they are specific to a certain set of html (and work well in the "snipped" of html)
[10:06:06] <BillCriswell> gordian: Which file?
[10:06:18] <jude2>  /msg Nickserv INFO ThillaiArasu
[10:06:26] <gordian> BillCriswell: jquery.nivo.slider.js
[10:06:29] <BillCriswell> jude2: Oops.
[10:06:32] <eedfwchris> I normally don't care, but the real issue I am having is that my .click() events end up firing twice, I assume because the $.ready() function is created twice
[10:06:33] <systemfault> FAIL
[10:06:37] <jude2> sorry wrong window
[10:06:42] <systemfault> jude2: Time to change your password..
[10:07:00] <systemfault> Ahh oops
[10:07:07] <systemfault> Thought it was identifying
[10:09:04] <adavia> can anybody give me an idea on how can i send the data being added in the list.. http://jsfiddle.net/uY5Gh/11/
[10:10:00] <BillCriswell> gordian: Does the demo for the slider work with IE8?
[10:12:18] <BillCriswell> gordian: Did you modify this?
[10:13:16] <BillCriswell> It's calling .trim() on a string... which would be OK if that function existed.. but I'm not sure it does.
[10:13:22] <gordian> yeah actually i did
[10:13:35] <gordian> when i replaced it with the original it works now
[10:13:38] <gordian> good call
[10:13:49] <BillCriswell> gordian: Haha good stuff.
[10:13:51] <gordian> but
[10:13:59] <gordian> this may not be jquery related
[10:14:12] <gordian> there's an image that won't load in IE8
[10:14:19] <gordian> if you click "Our Properties"
[10:14:29] <eedfwchris> anyone?
[10:14:33] <eedfwchris> inline jquery?
[10:14:34] <eedfwchris> thoughts?
[10:14:36] <gordian> the next to last property thumbnail doesn't load at all
[10:14:52] <gordian> works on other (modern) browsers
[10:16:21] <ajpiano> eedfwchris: it's fine to put them inline for any number of reasons
[10:16:25] <ajpiano> but you should still validate your assumptions
[10:16:45] <eedfwchris> ajpiano: what do you mean validate your assumptions?
[10:16:48] <ajpiano> because i'm not sure what you mean by "the $.ready function is craeted twice"
[10:16:54] <eedfwchris> Oh.
[10:17:04] <BillCriswell> gordian: Make sure the image isn't some weird shit like CMYK.
[10:17:24] <eedfwchris> ajpiano: I can still throw it in $(function () {}); as normal (even if there are multiple calls of $()?)
[10:17:42] <ajpiano> that *is* a document ready function
[10:18:06] <eedfwchris> ajpiano: http://yuji.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/jquery-click-event-fires-twice/ << this guy seems to have the same problem, mixing $.ready() in <
[10:18:14] <eedfwchris> <body> and <head>
[10:18:41] <eedfwchris> (though that post is old)
[10:18:49] <ajpiano> and cryptic in its explanation
[10:19:14] <eedfwchris> so you don't see any reason I couldn't have $.ready() in <head> and in <body>
[10:19:25] <ajpiano> if you have two ready functions, they will both be called
[10:19:39] <ajpiano> if they bind the same handlers, those handlers will be bound twice
[10:19:54] <eedfwchris> odd.
[10:20:04] <eedfwchris> (what I am experiencing)
[10:20:19] <eedfwchris> Let me play with this a bit more.
[10:20:55] <smallfoot-> I found a bug on Firefox/jQuery, press Ctrl+Shift+K and run http://pastebin.com/6EXfWERz it will say "no element found"

[10:47:39] <BillCriswell> webguest: Would the :visible selector help?

[10:51:43] <bot-t> webguest, http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[10:51:53] <webguest> ill make a demo, moment
[10:54:44] * djQuery dnag I miss my 2nd monitor
[10:56:11] <webguest> http://ok.robvaneckdesign.nl/#over
[10:56:14] <webguest> the demo link
[10:57:16] <djQuery> webguest, so what you want to close all the other ones when 1 is opened?
[10:57:40] <webguest> yes
[10:57:54] <webguest> so only 1 is open at a time
[10:58:53] <webguest> it's probably very easy, but i couldnt get it working.. was trying each '...opened' ... hide
[10:59:09] <webguest> but then erverything that opens would also close
[10:59:19] <webguest> or the toggle click count was messed up
[10:59:31] <webguest> i dont want to click twice before it closes
[11:00:01] * djQuery cant find edit button in paste2
[11:03:54] <djQuery> webguest, http://paste2.org/p/2860989
[11:05:03] <adavia> can anybody guide me how can i send the data added in the list to the server when i submit.. http://jsfiddle.net/uY5Gh/12/
[11:05:37] <webguest> djQuery, ty, but the the toggle click count is wrong
[11:05:43] <webguest> sometimes you have to click twice
[11:05:48] <webguest> refresh the url
[11:06:49] <webguest> afk for 5minutes
[11:06:52] <djQuery> webguest, yes I see that,
[11:07:13] <djQuery> webguest, anytime 1 was hidden by clicking on something else you have to click on it twice
[11:08:06] <djQuery> webguest, I wonder if toggle is storing some data on the clicked item so that it know which function to run
[11:08:26] <djQuery> webguest, add a console.log to each of the functin stating which function is running
[11:12:02] <MarcGuay> Anyone use the infinite scroll plugin inside an iframe?
[11:13:42] <djQuery> webguest, I got it, trigger the click event on any that are shown
[11:15:22] <djQuery> webguest, http://paste2.org/p/2861098
[11:16:44] <CannabisToke> I need to create a template that creates the number of divs inside of a div based of a variable... can't figure it out. any know of a good dynamic templating tutorial? Can't find one that fits my needs
[11:17:17] <djQuery> CannabisToke, have you tried knockout.js
[11:17:23] <djQuery> great tuts there
[11:17:34] <CannabisToke> nope, never heard of it. thanks, I'll go read =)
[11:17:50] <djQuery> CannabisToke, interactive tutorials
[11:17:59] <CannabisToke> those are the best
[11:24:41] <CannabisToke> if you were to append soemthing like $('<div>').append('<div><img></div>') what would be the best way to get inside and edit the img src? been using .find with a class and it seems wasteful
[11:25:30] <Gho5t> $('<div />').append('div>').append('<img src="foo.jpg');
[11:26:54] <djQuery> var string = '<div><image src="' + somevar +'"></div>';  $('.selector').append(string);
[11:27:08] <webguest> djQuery, now it doesnt hide the already opened li's
[11:27:23] <djQuery> webguest, putting together demo
[11:27:24] <CannabisToke> yes thanks! that's what I was wondering
[11:27:34] <CannabisToke> cus I've been using it in that way with a var
[11:31:09] <webguest> djQuery, isnt there an easy fix to fix the toggle click count? with a simple click() in a closeAll function?
[11:36:04] <zoned> the last line in a for loop is to execute a function, this function requires a callback to know when it has been completed. how can i implement a callback to know when ALL have been complete? (since i call this n times)

[11:40:26] <djQuery> maxmoore14, havent had issues with jsbin.com
[11:40:27] <AdamPDotty> okay, who let the cow loose?
[11:41:34] <maxmoore14> can someone help me me with a widget issue? http://jsfiddle.net/AaDfz/
[11:42:08] <maxmoore14> the console will catch an error when you focus on the description box
[11:42:39] <maxmoore14> looks like an issue with _delay maybe
[11:44:05] <CannabisToke> hey djQuery, mind looking at this and tell me what I'm doing terribly wrong =) http://cssdeck.com/labs/collab/uxa75crd/0
[11:44:24] <maxmoore14> gnarf: I thought I followed your instructions correctly with the new widget factory, but I guess not...
[11:46:21] <zoned> djQuery. thanks, but kind of confuse.. $images.each(function() { var $img = $(this); myFunction($img, callback); });       how to rewrite this using  promise() so when 'callback' would have been fired $images.length amount of times i can call a finished() function?
[11:46:21] <gnarf> not sure
[11:46:30] <gnarf> don't have time to look into it right now either
[11:46:42] <maxmoore14> ok
[11:47:21] <maxmoore14> ajpiano: you got a sec? having trouble with the _delay method of the new widget factory
[11:47:42] <m0nk_gr3g0r> What's the best way to troubleshoot a function with multiple calculations on input fields returning NaN, when all fields are type="number"?
[11:48:27] <zoned> m0nk_gr3g0r: console.log after each calculation? or step through with debugging tool?
[11:48:33] <NoiseEee> m0nk_gr3g0r: first off by realizing that not all browsers are going to respect that attribute
[11:48:44] <NoiseEee> m0nk_gr3g0r: iirc firefox and IE don't care about it
[11:48:54] <webguest> djQuery, it work! thx, where do i need to paste the scroll to code? http://paste2.org/p/2861350
[11:49:20] <m0nk_gr3g0r> thanks zoned & NoiseEee
[11:49:47] <narkeeso> can someone explain the benefits of using a library like this rather than just using css and toggling classes? - http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/
[11:50:20] <m0nk_gr3g0r> NoiseEee: do you know where I should look to find a cross-browser way to make sure fields are set to number types?

[11:50:48] <zoned> m0nk_gr3g0r:
[11:50:52] <QueueQueue> Does anyone know offhand how to set the selected option of a radio button group
[11:50:54] <NoiseEee> m0nk_gr3g0r: i think the only way is by writing a script really
[11:52:01] <Jon47> QueueQueue: $radioOption.prop('selected', true)
[11:52:12] <m0nk_gr3g0r> zoned: & NoiseEee: thanks
[11:53:23] <QueueQueue> @Jon47  I was hoping for a solution that wouldn`t require explicit reference to the individual radio button itself and by setting a value to the group (by name) it would select that appropriate radio button
[11:54:04] <QueueQueue> Something like $("input:radio[name='radioButtonGroup'"']:checked").val(1);
[11:54:06] <zoned> $images.each(function() { var $img = $(this); myFunction($img, callback); });      how to rewrite this using  promise() so i can know when every 'callback' is completed? struggling to understand this :-/
[11:54:21] <Jon47> QueueQueue: $radioGroup.find('[name="whatever"]').prop('selected', true)
[11:55:04] <Jon47> setting the "selected" property is the right way to do it
[11:55:17] <Gho5t> except there is none
[11:55:38] <Brodingo> m0nk_gr3g0r i use this to restrict input http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/DaAuQ/1/
[11:56:01] <adavia> is it possible to send the data in the list to the server? http://jsfiddle.net/uY5Gh/12/
[11:56:41] <m0nk_gr3g0r> thanks Brodingo: these are for valid input values though.
[11:56:44] <QueueQueue> @Jon47 So there is no way to set a radio button group by value then ?
[11:57:19] <m0nk_gr3g0r> Brodingo: like 150.00 and 70.0
[11:57:30] <Jon47> QueueQueue: how you get at the option you want to change the "selected" property on is up to you, but yeah there's totally a way to get at it by value
[11:58:08] <Jon47> maybe… $(':radio').find('[value="' + theValueYouWant + '"]').prop('selected', true)
[11:58:17] <Jon47> i think attribute selectors are the only option you've got
[11:58:18] <m0nk_gr3g0r> Brodingo: it's also concatenating instead of adding, and I don't know how to fix it :/
[11:58:58] <Jon47> you'll need to whittle down the list to just the group you're interested in, or else you might inadvertantly match radio inputs from other groups with the same value
[11:59:38] <Gho5t> QueueQueue: and use .prop('checked', true);
[11:59:47] <djQuery> webguest, I dont know
[12:02:22] <adavia> =/
[12:08:51] <veQue> quick help in firebug... i'm clicking stye-> and checking hover  but when i try to see the hover rules it disapears again
[12:09:03] <veQue> any idea why?
[12:09:19] <veQue> i'm sure i'm not the only one with that problem
[12:10:31] <djQuery> zoned, don't know havent ever needed it yet
[12:10:57] <CannabisToke> thanks djQuery, I think I got it for now
[12:11:00] <djQuery> CannabisToke, thats the problem writing a loop like that in an envirment that does auto updates
[12:11:03] <djQuery> lol
[12:11:43] <CannabisToke> I thought that it would somehow notice if it wasn't going to work and then stop
[12:11:54] <djQuery> CannabisToke, nope
[12:11:58] <djQuery> oops
[12:12:05] <CannabisToke> damn, gonna have to save often then
[12:12:42] <djQuery>  need to rememeber to write them as statement that rertuns fasle do the insides of the loop
[12:12:52] <djQuery> then fix the statement to return true
[12:13:08] <CannabisToke> thanks, I can remember that
[12:13:27] <jj-q> question.. should i need to prependTo the hidden field  in the example to send the data out..?  http://jsfiddle.net/uY5Gh/13/
[12:16:02] <jj-q> ¿?
[12:16:47] <veQue> -_-
[12:16:51] <veQue> omg
[12:17:06] <veQue> i think this hover style is done through javascript?
[12:17:55] <veQue> i want to kill who ever developed this website
[12:18:08] <veQue> screw it
[12:18:16] <Gho5t> is it an anchor
[12:19:08] <veQue> yes
[12:19:33] <Gho5t> hrmph
[12:19:44] <Gho5t> trying to think why someone would do that
[12:20:03] <Gho5t> if it's just to style it
[12:20:23] <veQue> i was supposed to remodel this site and do some database work.. turns out database work trumps site redesign so instead  iwas gonna just make some basic color adjustments because whoever did it must becolorb lind
[12:20:31] <veQue> but turns out the hover is javascript
[12:20:42] <veQue> yeh i'll do it that way
[12:21:04] <bil`> anyone familiar with the jQuery validation plugin. I have a couple general questions.
[12:21:11] <veQue> it's using .addClass i presume
[12:21:26] <veQue> .addClass for simple hoverstat
[12:21:28] <djQuery> bil`, see ?ass
[12:21:38] <djQuery> lol see ?ask
[12:21:48] <djQuery> lazy bot
[12:21:54] <bil`> yea yeah ill ask away
[12:23:12] <bil`> So everything I see about using the validation plugin suggests it validates on form submission. Is there anyway just to have it validate individual fields without submission? Like on other events?
[12:23:25] <bil`> and does it been to be bound to an actual form or will any container work?
[12:23:32] <bil`> been=need*
[12:24:14] <veQue> ok fixed
[12:24:26] <veQue> took longer than i care to admit
[12:26:01] <djQuery> bil`, you can manualy call the validate method on say blur of the field
[12:26:45] <djQuery> bil`, http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Validator/element#element
[12:29:17] <djQuery> bil`, lol thier demos don't seem to be working anymore
[12:30:08] <bil`> is this what most people still use or is there something better these days
[12:31:30] <djQuery> bil`, yeah, I saw they just had a new release the other day that fixed some of the html5 issues they were having
[12:36:35] <kripster> anyone any experience with jquery mobile?
[12:39:59] <kripster> is there any limitation to the amount of pages you can use on a single html page?
[12:41:18] <djQuery> kripster, how many do you have so far?
[12:41:34] <djQuery> I am only upto 4 in mine
[12:42:00] <kripster> i only have 7 but i am thinking of going as far as a 100, not sure if that will casue issues?
[12:42:02] <djQuery> gues it winds up to a limitation of what you can show in some kinda navigation
[12:42:16] <djQuery> kripster, slowness in loading?
[12:42:46] <kripster> but surely you are not loading, you are only displaying the relevant div?
[12:43:30] <iman> Hi, there are many elements in a div, I want to get all elements who have display: none; style, how can i do that in jquery ?
[12:45:11] <tlkr> iman, you could do $('div').children(':not(:visible)')
[12:45:25] <iman> tlkr: thank you
[12:45:42] <tlkr> :-)
[12:47:07] <kripster> djquery: have you much experience with jquerymobile
[12:50:25] <iman> when I use load() to load a page in another page, It caches older page, how can I disable cache for all project or specially for a load() function ?
[13:08:14] <Caelum> can I see the POST parameters in safari's inspect element for a page?
[13:09:24] <Caelum> blah, it only shows query params
[13:16:33] <BillCriswell> If you dudes have a search box and you want to do like a "live search" would you rely on keyup or use a timeout to see if the query has been updated in the last like second?
[13:16:50] <BillCriswell> dudes and ladies*
[13:18:39] <jedimind> would probably use an existing plugin and not try to reinvent the wheel
[13:18:53] <jedimind> but from a functional point of view, you should do a couple of events
[13:19:22] <jedimind> firstly, keyup, but minimum of 3 characters, and also do a timeout loop of like 600ms-1000ms to wait for typing to stop so you're not flooding your service(s) with requests
[13:19:35] <humanoide> BillCriswell: maybe look at jquery ui autocomplete
[13:19:58] <jedimind> only if you're going to use other UI bits as well, dont include jquery-ui and/or jquery if all you need is autcomplete
[13:19:59] <BillCriswell> So like a debounce.
[13:20:04] <xenaxon> hi, whats the best charts/diagram libary for js/jquery ?
[13:21:19] <davemo> xenaxon: i've had great success with highcharts
[13:21:59] <xenaxon> thanks davemo
[13:22:11] <xenaxon> davemo: what do you say about fusioncharts ?
[13:22:35] <davemo> xenaxon: i used it a long time ago, but highcharts seems to have better backwards compatibility if IE6 or IE7 are in your browser support matrix
[13:22:46] <xenaxon> oh
[13:22:49] <xenaxon> ok, right
[13:22:54] <davemo> fusioncharts may have improved, last time i used it was like ~6 years ago
[13:23:04] <xenaxon> does it suport dinamic widths?
[13:23:08] <xenaxon> flexible layout?
[13:23:09] <BillCriswell> jedimind: Can you name an existing one?
[13:23:27] <xenaxon> yes it does, i checked
[13:23:28] <davemo> xenaxon: there are event hooks you can bind to, but IIRC it redraws on page resize
[13:23:49] <jedimind> jquery-ui autocomplete is the best most rounded one and the one i have any experience with out of the box
[13:23:55] <jedimind> but ive written my fair share of them from scratch
[13:24:21] <jedimind> keep in mind that the autocomplete is just a small part of it, you have to do key events as well for tab / arrow keys, focus states need to be retained
[13:24:31] <jedimind> events pushed to form submission when they down arrow + enter for example
[13:24:46] <jedimind> so the trivial bit about making the call and getting a list is about 30% of the work :)
[13:24:54] <BillCriswell> jedimind: Haha I'm aware.
[13:25:04] <xenaxon> yeah, it seems flexible
[13:27:56] <BillCriswell> I wonder if bootstraps typeahead can do the trick. Might as well try for fun. No rush on thisl
[13:29:22] <kripster> real simple one guys, how do i get the dropdown to be inline with the make label,  http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/10/, thanks
[13:30:18] <BillCriswell> If it's the simple you should be able to google it quick.
[13:30:23] <BillCriswell> it's that*
[13:31:55] <BillCriswell> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/forms/selects/
[13:32:28] <kripster> sorry Bill, should have said it would be simple for someone who isn't a newbie
[13:34:44] <lejocelyn> hey
[13:34:57] <lejocelyn> is there something stupidly wrong within this fonction ? : http://pastebin.fr/26441
[13:36:07] <lejocelyn> it's for input forms that can be multiplied
[13:40:32] <BillCriswell> lejocelyn: I wrote this up for you earlier but you left, should be able to help: http://jsbin.com/esokuj/1/edit
[13:42:59] <kripster> ok this doesn't seem as easy as I thought as I have tried what Bill suggested and the label still doesn't line up with dropdown, any suggestions for a newbie??? http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/14/
[13:44:49] <relipse>  i need to append some text to a textarea based on the select box value, if the user changes the select box item, twice, it will have 2 appended text amounts, how do i stop this?
[13:45:13] <BillCriswell> kripster: You want the label in side of the <div>
[13:45:28] <BillCriswell> Also, in jsfiddle the window might be too narrow for you to see it on the side.
[13:45:52] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/15/
[13:46:20] <kripster> cheers Bill, got it
[13:47:30] <lejocelyn> BillCriswell: thanks
[13:47:40] <BillCriswell> lejocelyn: No problem!
[13:48:25] <kripster> BillCriswell: thanks
[13:51:01] <lejocelyn> BillCriswell: is it important to write the (jQuery) at the end ?
[13:51:29] <Gho5t> if you want to keep it real
[13:52:01] <lejocelyn> :)
[13:52:47] <BillCriswell> lejocelyn: I do that just incase you ever use noConflict()
[13:53:28] <lejocelyn> as I don't know yet what it is
[13:53:34] <lejocelyn> I guess I won't use it soon :)
[14:03:30] <kripster> can someone help me with being able to select just one component, how can i only apply the styling to the top dropdown?http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/19/
[14:07:33] <lethjakman_lapto> hey, I'm trying to tamperscript prepend in some code, but the page uses ajax to change the content that I want to insert into
[14:07:42] <amh345> have you guys seen those arrows people use on a horizontal nav bar. the ones that follow whichever nav link you rollover??  do those have a name?  im trying to find how people do those.
[14:07:43] <lethjakman_lapto> is there a way to execute code whenever the page changes or something?
[14:07:52] <blahwoop> question. when i check a box a div shows. but when I come back to update it. the box is checked but the div doesn't show. what am i doing wrong on the js side?
[14:09:46] <lethjakman_lapto> blahwoop: by the sounds of it the event isn't executing to show the div, you'd need to store it in a cookie if you want it to be persistant
[14:09:54] <Gho5t> expound on "when I come back"
[14:09:57] <lethjakman_lapto> and of course execute based off of what's in the cookie
[14:10:40] <amh345> i guess this sorta does what im looking for http://css-tricks.com/jquery-magicline-navigation/
[14:11:54] <lethjakman_lapto> amh345: what do you mean arrows? This seems more like something you would want to do with CSS's hover
[14:12:36] <amh345> css hover would do it.  but the arrow (img/whatever) needs to follow the mouse and center under each nav item
[14:12:54] <amh345> so theres def some jquery animate jazz in there somehwere.
[14:13:29] <amh345> this link here does it. but instead of an arrow they highlight the li element http://css-tricks.com/jquery-magicline-navigation/
[14:14:38] <coder7> iPad presents an issue with numerics.  The char codes reported for 1 - 9 fall between 49 - 57. iPad sends the correct codes for these numbers. However on the numeric keypad there are other non numeric characters for which iPad sends the same values. For example the "(" character sends the same value as the number 9.
[14:14:41] <lethjakman_lapto> amh345: #example-one li a:hover { color: white; }
[14:15:07] <lethjakman_lapto> amh345: that's what's changing the color, it's called hover
[14:15:31] <lethjakman_lapto> you could use jqueries .hover() if you wanted to hide or show elements within that div though
[14:15:38] <amh345> yes. but you can see in that demo that there is a red line under the nav that follows
[14:15:40] <lethjakman_lapto> just include the arrow you want with the attribute hidden
[14:16:22] <socialcloud> Hey guys I heard great things about the stunning work you do here.  And was referred to u guys by Michael from sicdigital.  I transferred my site to a colleague  of of mine., and the slider is having issues. The site in question is: peoplenotary.com error is with the fadein command, I tried playing around with it, and got partial success, but i am no great coder, this seems like a quick fix
[14:20:55] <lethjakman_lapto> amh345: that's #magic-line
[14:21:00] <amh345> lethjakman_lapto: i dont think we're talking about the same functionality
[14:21:16] <amh345> yes. magicline
[14:21:19] <lethjakman_lapto> amh345: are you talking about the red line that shows up at the bottom when it shows up?
[14:21:36] <kripster> sorry, this doesn't seem to work when i apply to my form, can someone tell me why the make label is not inline with dropdown, very confusing???http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/23/
[14:21:52] <amh345> yes. the redline, lethjakman_lapto

[14:21:57] <amh345> it follows the mouse
[14:22:24] <raj> any jqui peepz?
[14:22:34] <amh345> i dont think hover on it's own is what i want.
[14:22:50] <lethjakman_lapto> amh345: oh! I understand what you mean
[14:23:12] <beasty> hi guys
[14:23:14] <beasty> i'm pondering
[14:23:22] <lethjakman_lapto> the animate changes the distance from the left the div it's contained in
[14:23:33] <beasty> it here is a way to highlight certain words in a <div>
[14:23:41] <beasty> or make them clickable
[14:23:45] <amh345> lethjakman_lapto: yes, i tihnk that's what's happening.
[14:23:58] <amh345> im trying to find a realy scaled down demo of it.  i only need the 'redline' portion.
[14:24:16] <amh345> i've not done anytihng like this before. so i was just checking to see if anyone knew of a simple, clean lib or something.
[14:24:17] <kripster> any ideas, this has been driving me nuts all night
[14:24:28] <socialcloud> Its my first time using IRC wordpress support, forgive me if I am not asking in the right manner or IRC etiquette. Thanks
[14:25:22] <kripster> does it have anything to do with the buttons above it?
[14:25:32] <kripster> http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/24/?
[14:27:38] <lethjakman_lapto> beasty: you could wrap them in a span using a regular expression? that's about it though.
[14:27:41] <kripster> billcriswell: any idea why when buttons are above the make lable is no longer inline ? http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/24/
[14:28:12] <amh345> kripster: did you try in #css?
[14:28:35] <lethjakman_lapto> amh345: easiest thing to do woudl be to play with jquery, once you know the library this is pretty strait forward
[14:28:46] <amh345> hah ok.
[14:29:17] <aghouseh> has anyone heard of a type manipulation plugin that does kerning ONLY? something akin to slabText.js but without the font scaling
[14:29:22] <BillCriswell> socialcloud: You're all right haha.
[14:29:53] <kripster> amh345: this works fine, http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/17/ but when I apply this to my form it doesn't line
[14:30:13] <socialcloud> BillCriswell: thanks
[14:30:26] <BillCriswell> I'm taking a look, hoping I can help.
[14:30:31] <amh345> kripster: maybe some sort of wrapper?
[14:31:08] <socialcloud> BillCriswell: to save u time: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4948979
[14:32:17] <kripster> as billcriswell pointed out to me if i wrap it in a div with data-role="fieldcontain" it wraps it, but somehow it doesn't work on my form  http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/24/
[14:33:10] <kripster> billcriswell: are my buttons causing issues?
[14:36:02] <jordanlev> hello. I have a question -- do I just ask, or is there some procedure?
[14:36:47] <kripster> any ideas why the div data-role="fieldcontain" isn't working for my make label ?http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/24/
[14:36:49] <BillCriswell> Just ask. If someone can help they will.
[14:36:54] <jordanlev> Does anyone know where I can find the documentation for jquery-tmpl?
[14:37:14] <jordanlev> It appears to be gone since the recent website design overhaul
[14:37:22] <oakdog8> asdf
[14:39:16] <kripster> got it, thanks was an issue with padding, cheers guys
[14:45:12] <BillCriswell> socialcloud: This is a weird one. What happens if you put console.log(settings); inside that it interval?
[14:46:56] <BillCriswell> socialcloud: Also, in custom.js put var before settings = jQuery.extend(..); in $.fn.pSlider
[14:47:33] <BillCriswell> socialcloud: I'm thinking you're just overwriting settings somewhere.
[14:48:55] <raj> shoky?
[14:49:06] <BillCriswell> He's probably poopin!
[14:49:23] <webguest_> i am vertically centering an image, but my jquery is not giving the correct height of the image and wrapper.. http://paste2.org/p/2862497\
[14:50:52] <socialcloud> BillCriswell: well so the issue i think is with the fadein() i played with it and had some partial success. this is the line in question, unless its something deeper.  slideWrapper.children('div').eq(slideTarget).fadeIn(settings.fadeSpeed);
[14:51:41] <socialcloud> BillCriswell: as for console.log(settings); u want that in place of settings.fadeSpeed?
[14:52:05] <BillCriswell> socialcloud: YEah, the error is saying you can't read settings.fadeSpeed, the issue isn't fadeIn()
[14:52:49] <BillCriswell> socialcloud: I would just put it inside that setInterval() after the "settings" are set.
[14:53:09] <raj> BillCriswell, how are you with jqui?
[14:53:49] <BillCriswell> webguest_: Try wrapping it in $(window).load(function(){ ... });
[14:53:56] <BillCriswell> raj: Not familiar with it to be honest.
[14:54:04] <BillCriswell> Just know jQuery slightly lol
[14:54:07] <webguest_> BillCriswell, also did that, but the result is the same :(
[14:54:17] <webguest_> it seems like load is never reached/ignored :s
[15:06:26] <socialcloud> BillCriswell: Also, in custom.js put var before settings = jQuery.extend(..); in $.fn.pSlider. Im sorry to be a drag but I might need baby steps on this one, I tried google for some help to no avail.
[15:09:41] <socialcloud> BillCriswell: like so: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4949250
[15:13:57] <socialcloud> BillCriswell: just to give you a background that might help, this is not my code but by Peerapong, he is one of the elites as far as themeforest. But this wonderful theme is no longer supported :( and he is too busy to help out or it will take a while to get a hold of him, so I have to bootstrap and learn my self.  Everything worked great until I moved the files to new server instance :(
[15:27:43] <shoky> ey raj
[15:38:44] <eyoosuf> $("div").data('role');
[15:46:26] <socialcloud> hey guys, i guess bill is gone anyone want to fill in helping a brotha out, he was helping me for a bit
[15:56:47] <SeanJM> anyone here have experience with touch events on an iPhone?
[15:58:58] <SeanJM> as soon as I have: var touch = event.touches[]; in my script, the iPhone doesn't run anything
[15:59:34] <shoky> what's that [] for
[15:59:51] <SeanJM> var touch = event.touches[0];
[16:00:24] <SeanJM> [0] selects the one finger
[16:01:24] <danheberden> coldhead: come back
[16:01:25] <shoky> try event.originalEvent.touches[0] maybe ?
[16:01:42] <ryanneufeld> coldhead don't be like that
[16:03:15] <SeanJM> That did it
[16:03:21] <SeanJM> thank you shoky
[16:20:33] <Poopookaka> sup skanks
[16:20:38] <Poopookaka> :D
[16:20:49] <coldhead> how rude
[16:21:04] <Poopookaka> lool
[16:21:09] <ryanneufeld> yeah, coldhead is the resident jerk, don't take that away from him
[16:21:22] <ryanneufeld> in all reality though Poopookaka, not cool
[16:21:23] <coldhead> again, how rude
[16:21:31] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: <3
[16:22:13] <Poopookaka> ok i sory
[16:22:13] <jj_qq> hello =)
[16:22:46] <coldhead> no need to be sorry, just be better <3
[16:22:54] <jj_qq> question.. should i need to prependTo the hidden field  in this example to send the data out..?  http://jsfiddle.net/uY5Gh/13/
[16:24:06] * Poopookaka wipes poo on the wall
[16:24:42] <ryanneufeld> Poopookaka: stop
[16:24:50] <Poopookaka> fine fine
[16:24:53] <ryanneufeld> or you'll be asked to leave
[16:25:31] <coldhead> there are no walls
[16:25:35] <jj_qq> i didnt realize this room had moderators
[16:25:45] <ryanneufeld> jj_qq: yeah, quite a few
[16:25:50] <ryanneufeld> you never know who's gonna be one
[16:25:54] <coldhead> i've never seen them
[16:26:13] <jj_qq> hehe
[16:26:18] <ryanneufeld> jj_qq: your question made no sense
[16:26:43] <jj_qq> ryanneufeld: why?
[16:27:23] <jj_qq> well im kinda new with this tecnology so might be
[16:27:25] <ryanneufeld> I mean, I don't understand what you're asking.
[16:27:40] <ryanneufeld> the example you gave doesn't seem to do anything
[16:28:35] <jj_qq> ryanneufeld:  i need to send the id_employee value once i submit that form.. so im wondering how to do that
[16:28:54] <ryanneufeld> okay
[16:28:57] <ryanneufeld> that I can help with
[16:29:11] <jj_qq> ryanneufeld:  the autocomplete works.. you can add employees to the list
[16:29:19] <ryanneufeld> I see you have <input type="hidden" id="id_employee" name="id_employee[]">
[16:29:27] <jj_qq> ryanneufeld:  yes
[16:29:30] <ryanneufeld> I would start with none of those existing
[16:29:55] <ryanneufeld> also if you're using the [] in a name, you need an index
[16:30:04] <ryanneufeld> depending on what your back end does with it
[16:30:06] <ryanneufeld> I use PHP
[16:30:20] <jj_qq> yes.. i also use php
[16:30:24] <ryanneufeld> I'm pretty sure you need the index
[16:30:35] <ryanneufeld> though it's been a while and I'm rusty on that one
[16:31:22] <ryanneufeld> jj_qq: you also have no form element
[16:32:24] <jj_qq> ryanneufeld:  that part is inside a form
[16:32:32] <ryanneufeld> oh
[16:32:33] <ryanneufeld> okay
[16:32:40] <ryanneufeld> I didn't see it in the fiddle
[16:32:43] <ryanneufeld> so I assumed
[16:33:11] <jj_qq> ryanneufeld:  i was wondering maybe i can add a hidden input everytime i select an employee
[16:33:29] <ryanneufeld> that's what I was getting to
[16:33:30] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[16:33:57] <jj_qq> mm let me see
[16:35:20] <ryanneufeld> jj_qq: http://jsfiddle.net/uY5Gh/14/
[16:35:23] <ryanneufeld> something like that
[16:35:26] <ryanneufeld> dunno if that will work
[16:37:14] <jj_qq> ryanneufeld:  i have checked changing the input to text to see if it works but nope =/
[16:41:40] <ryanneufeld> jj_qq:
[16:41:44] <ryanneufeld> jj_qq: I got it
[16:41:59] <ryanneufeld> jj_qq: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/uY5Gh/16/
[16:42:22] <ryanneufeld> might not be the prettiest solution,but it works
[16:42:52] <ryanneufeld> jj_qq: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/uY5Gh/17/
[16:43:07] <jj_qq> ryanneufeld:  excelentttt
[16:43:47] <ryanneufeld> notice I changed your buttons
[16:43:57] <ryanneufeld> to using inputs of submit and reset
[16:44:01] <jj_qq> ryanneufeld:  what have u changed in this last one?
[16:44:06] <ryanneufeld> formatting
[16:44:14] <jj_qq> ryanneufeld:  ohh yes
[16:44:46] <ryanneufeld> buttons are nice, but there are semantically correct buttons for submitting forms
[16:45:05] <timwis> Hey guys, is there a way to make $.ajax() use CORS if it's available and JSONP if not?
[16:45:11] <jj_qq> ryanneufeld:  my question is.. what would be a good solution for this?
[16:45:14] <ryanneufeld> to process the form, you can do $('#assignmentForm').submit(function(){//code here});
[16:45:27] <ryanneufeld> jj_qq: I'd use what I gave you
[16:45:29] <ryanneufeld> but I wrote it
[16:45:52] <ryanneufeld> timwis: yes there is see ?ajax
[16:46:03] <ryanneufeld> ?api jquery.ajax() @ timwis
[16:46:03] <b-ot> timwis: No matches.
[16:46:06] <ryanneufeld> fml
[16:46:09] <jj_qq> ryanneufeld:  but u told me is not a good solution right?
[16:46:20] <timwis> ryanneufeld: I'm looking at the docs on .ajax() now, I've used it plenty
[16:46:21] <ryanneufeld> I said it's not pretty
[16:46:32] <timwis> But it doesn't fall back on jsonp does it?
[16:46:45] <jj_qq> ryanneufeld:  ok got it.. owe you a beer buddy.. thanks so much
[16:47:31] <ryanneufeld> timwis: "multiple, space-separated values: As of jQuery 1.5, jQuery can convert a dataType from what it received in the Content-Type header to what you require. For example, if you want a text response to be treated as XML, use "text xml" for the dataType. You can also make a JSONP request, have it received as text, and interpreted by jQuery as XML: "jsonp text xml." Similarly, a shorthand string such as "
[16:47:31] <ryanneufeld> jsonp xml" will first attempt to convert from jsonp to xml, and, failing that, convert from jsonp to text, and then from text to xml."
[16:47:42] <ryanneufeld> timwis: it's in the docs mate
[16:48:01] <ryanneufeld> 'cors json' would probably be what you want your DataType to be
[16:48:10] <ryanneufeld> jj_qq: nah, we're good
[16:48:31] <timwis> ryanneufeld: I don't believe cors is a datatype
[16:48:35] <timwis> hm, perhaps json jsonp
[16:48:44] <ryanneufeld> what is cors?
[16:49:12] <ryanneufeld> timwis: there is also the ability to write your own converters
[16:49:32] <timwis> oh you're not familiar with cors
[16:49:34] <timwis> it's not a language
[16:49:39] <timwis> it's cross origin resource sharing
[16:49:44] <timwis> basically just json, without the p
[16:49:50] <ryanneufeld> ah
[16:49:50] <ryanneufeld> I see
[16:49:54] <ryanneufeld> googled it
[16:49:58] <ryanneufeld> any how
[16:50:05] <ryanneufeld> datatype would be the way to go
[16:50:12] <ryanneufeld> that or use the fail handler to try the next one
[16:50:29] <ryanneufeld> or you could just do jsonp and be done with it :P
[16:51:39] <ryanneufeld> O
[16:51:42] <ryanneufeld> I am off
[17:03:18] <nerk> what's a better way to DOM ready, $(function() { }); or $(document).ready(function() { });
[17:03:20] <nerk> ?
[17:03:57] <nerk> I've seen the former being used more frequently these days
[17:04:22] <nerk> I guess it's synonymous and it's really about what jquery versions you want to support?
[17:09:45] <shoky> nerk: ya, synonymous
[17:10:37] <coldhead> nerk: the latter way is far more readable
[17:10:51] <coldhead> and should be preferred if anyone is ever going to read your code
[17:11:46] <nerk> I guess in terms of semantics, I get you
[17:11:59] <nerk> not all users will get the first as having anything related to a ready state
[17:12:12] <nerk> thanks for input
[17:12:30] <ryanneufeld> I only do the first one
[17:12:49] <ryanneufeld> cause I don't like verbosity
[17:15:09] <coldhead> everytime you use the shortcut, some poor noob has to try to work out what it means
[17:15:15] <coldhead> and there's literally nothing to google
[17:15:26] <coldhead> so then maybe a few plucky souls make it to irc to
[17:15:35] <coldhead> ask what it does
[17:15:47] <coldhead> and every time someone asks i get like a 1000 days older
[17:15:56] <coldhead> AND I'M PRETTY OLD TO BEGIN WITH
[17:16:10] <coldhead> I BLAME YOU FOR THIS RYRY
[17:16:15] <coldhead> A LOT
[17:16:21] <nerk> lol
[17:16:34] <nerk> too dunny
[17:16:38] <nerk> funny
[17:16:52] <coldhead> dunny is also acceptable
[17:17:05] <ryanneufeld> 'too dunny' yeah, this conversation was the shits anyway :p
[17:17:36] <ryanneufeld> nerk: if you didn't know, dunny means toilet in downunderland where clod is from
[17:17:49] <nerk> LOL, well that is just an epic typo then
[17:19:33] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: I call BS
[17:19:35] <ryanneufeld> `g $(function() jquery
[17:19:35] <b-ot> ryanneufeld: What a heck is a (function ($){ ... }) - jQuery Howto → http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2008/12/what-heck-is-function-jquery.html
[17:20:20] <coldhead> the fact that that article exists PROVES MY POINT
[17:20:23] <nerk> but it starts with what the heck is..  that suggests unreadable to me :P
[17:20:28] <nerk> lol, exactly
[17:20:52] <coldhead> "oh this has something to do with the document being ready" vs "this has something to do with... turning a fucntion...  into dollars? fuck this, i'm going back to medical school"
[17:21:11] <coldhead> AND THEN THOSE PEOPLE WILL BE OPERATING ON YOU IN 10 YEARS
[17:21:23] <HarryPitfall> How i can override the renderItem on latest autocomplete?
[17:21:24] <coldhead> CAN YOU AFFORD TO TAKE THAT RISK
[17:21:28] <nerk> to make things more confusing
[17:21:33] <nerk> wrap a closure around that
[17:21:36] <coldhead> you probably can because you are turning your functions into $$s
[17:21:38] <HarryPitfall> data('autocomplete')._renderItem isn't effective anymore
[17:23:09] <ryanneufeld> nerk: use what you feel is right.
[17:24:02] <ryanneufeld> or let coldhead tell you what to do. he's not dumb :)
[17:24:13] <nerk> for my own stuff, I'd probably prefer the shortcut, for plugins of client work, I think I will stick with doc.ready
[17:24:26] <nerk> plugins OR client work I mean.
[17:24:27] <ryanneufeld> there you go
[17:24:37] <ryanneufeld> a compromise
[17:25:36] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's take a short break
[17:25:40] <nerk> On a side topic, I just pulled a super long grayish hair from my beard hair.  I think the previous topic does age folks
[17:26:47] <nerk> Next thing it will be my eye brows.
[17:27:45] <abjorn> I'm 21. I didn't used to have gray hairs, then I started using CSS.

[17:30:31] <MeMReS> .clearfix -_-

[17:32:16] <Gho5t> overflow: hidden;

[18:49:16] <djQuery> anyone tell me why  the close button on this jquery mobile dialog is off?
[18:49:18] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/oduyut/2/edit
[18:55:35] <sinusss> is this legal? var params = new Object(); params.guid = 'foo'; I seem to be having problems setting a value for guid
[18:56:36] <ngharo> yea but crummy. instead: var params = {guid: 'food'};
[18:57:17] <djQuery> sinusss,  or even var params = {};   params.guid = 'foo';
[18:57:51] <joelbirch> djQuery: Wrap "Add Expense" in a heading tag (h2 or something) creates more space in the header. The make the close button use ui-btn-right instead of ui-btn-left.
[18:58:22] <djQuery> joelbirch, thanks
[18:58:36] <sinusss> why use {} instead of new Object() ?
[18:58:49] <djQuery> sinusss, less typing
[18:58:57] <djQuery> lol
[18:59:50] <djQuery> joelbirch, how do I make the button on the right?
[19:00:22] <poopaged12> hey what wrong with this http://jsfiddle.net/GbHhX/
[19:00:42] <poopaged12> whats^
[19:00:55] <joelbirch> djQuery: I think you just add a data attribute. Check the jQuery Mobile docs for which one.
[19:01:45] <djQuery> joelbirch, yeah the docs on dialog is a little lax
[19:02:36] <djQuery> joelbirch, it looks good enough now that I got the h2 in there
[19:02:44] <djQuery> I'm not picky
[19:03:30] <poopaged12> http://jsfiddle.net/GbHhX/2/
[19:03:56] <joelbirch> djQuery: looks the same to me. Is there a new url?
[19:04:24] <djQuery> joelbirch, didn't make changes to that one
[19:04:25] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/tipper/21/edit
[19:04:37] <djQuery> that one was just a basic
[19:04:51] <djQuery> trying to get this complete and then wrap it in a phonegap app
[19:04:59] <joelbirch> djQuery: looks good to me
[19:05:15] <ngharo> poopaged12: server side problem, it's not wrapping the results in a callback function
[19:06:31] <poopaged12> hrm so what have i got to do to the server end then ?
[19:07:00] <ngharo> take the GET var "callback" value and wrap the json inside it
[19:08:59] <ngharo> also don't use alert() for great justice
[19:09:03] <ngharo> makes baby jesus cry
[19:09:32] <poopaged12> heh i know i know ;).. but i dont get what you mean ..
[19:09:55] <poopaged12> in the php do ... thejsoncallback=$_GET["callback"]; .. thejsoncallback["blbla"]="blablal"; ... and json encode that variable
[19:09:56] <poopaged12> ?
[19:10:42] <ngharo> no, take your json_encoded $output and return "$thejsoncallback($output)"
[19:10:57] <poopaged12> ah
[19:11:10] <ngharo> where $thejsoncallback is $_GET['callback']

[20:00:54] <djQuery> joelbirch, any tips for styling the buttons on the dialog?
[20:01:01] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/tipper/21/edit
[20:01:46] <poopaged12> whats wrong with line 22?
[20:03:08] <joelbirch> djQuery: you could highlight the "Ok" button in blue (or whatever) by adding the relevant data attribute to it
[20:03:40] <joelbirch> djQuery: I think there is a way to set the default button
[20:04:19] <joelbirch> djQuery: also, is "Delete" necessary in an "Add Expense" dialog?
[20:04:43] <djQuery> joelbirch, it will be hidden depending on how its launched
[20:04:50] <joelbirch> ah
[20:04:59] <djQuery> joelbirch, it is also the edit expense dialog
[20:05:45] <djQuery> joelbirch, whish there was just a list of what data attributes that jqm looked for
[20:06:44] <joelbirch> Last time I looked I thought the docs were good. Will have a look...
[20:07:54] <joelbirch> djQuery: I assume you have seen this http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/buttons/buttons-themes.html
[20:10:48] <jj_qq> how can i style this div..  $( "<div>" ).text( message ).prependTo( "#log" );
[20:10:52] <greg5green> poopaged12, you should be using typeof to test if it's an object
[20:11:07] <greg5green> poopaged12, if (typeof this === 'object')
[20:11:27] <poopaged12> oh ok
[20:11:30] <greg5green> something about that still doesnt seem quite right, but its right before bedtime
[20:11:40] <greg5green> and just remember
[20:12:02] <greg5green> '$(this)' (which is different from 'this') always comes back as an object
[20:12:14] <greg5green> just 'this' is situational
[20:12:40] <greg5green> if you are just iterating over json data, i'd write a proper js for loop though
[20:12:46] <greg5green> .each() is slow
[20:12:59] <joelbirch> jj_qq: chain .addClass('myclass') after creating the div
[20:13:14] <poopaged12> ok thanks for the advice much appreciated
[20:14:25] <jj_qq> joelbirch:  .css() is also valid?
[20:15:06] <joelbirch> jj_qq: sure, if you don't mind mixing styling with your JS
[20:18:56] <jj_qq> joelbirch: "<div>" ).text( message ).prependTo( "#log" ).css("margin-left:10px");
[20:19:30] <joelbirch> that should do it
[20:19:37] <joelbirch> actually no
[20:19:52] <ngharo> poopaged12: more like http://jsfiddle.net/GbHhX/20/
[20:19:52] <joelbirch> .css('margin-left','10px')
[20:20:03] <ngharo> reduce, reuse, recycle
[20:21:29] <jj_qq> joelbirch:  there you go.. what about if i want to include an image next to the div ?
[20:21:31] <joelbirch> jj_qq: or .css({'margin-left':'10px'}) as you can then add more rules to the same object
[20:22:20] <joelbirch> .after('<img src="/image.jpg" alt>')
[20:22:58] <jj_qq> let me try that out
[20:25:23] <joelbirch> jj_qq: you know, you could just inject all of this as a string of html wrapped in jQuery
[20:25:44] <jj_qq> joelbirch:  how would i do that
[20:25:55] <jj_qq> sorry im kinda new
[20:28:12] <joelbirch> jj_qq: http://pastebin.com/fQ4LeWyn
[20:28:15] <coldhead> no need to apologise for that jj_qq
[20:28:58] <joelbirch> jj_qq: you might find this method simpler, depending on what you are doing
[20:29:19] <jj_qq> joelbirch:  let me try it out
[20:32:22] <jj_qq> joelbirch:  i was doing this http://pastebin.com/tuN18kUR
[20:33:25] <joelbirch> jj_qq: is it working?
[20:33:45] <jj_qq> joelbirch:  nop hehe
[20:34:22] <joelbirch> jj_qq: you may need to post a link to a test page
[20:34:37] <jj_qq> joelbirch:  actually i need to put an image before and after the message
[20:34:51] <joelbirch> jj_qq: .before()
[20:34:51] <jj_qq> jsfiddle?
[20:34:56] <joelbirch> sure
[20:38:42] <Foxhoundz> poopaged12: there are better ways to see if it's an object
[20:40:33] <jj_qq> joelbirch:  is this correct? .after('<i style="float: right;" class="icon-remove-sign>');
[20:41:06] <relipse> how do i initialize a ckeditor dynamically?
[20:41:12] <joelbirch> jj_qq: looks like you are missing a double quote after "sign"
[20:42:58] <jj_qq> joelbirch:  well is not adding it every time the message is being prepenTo.. it just included the image in the hole div
[20:43:24] <coder7of9> how to select all inpts in a div
[20:43:45] <coder7of9> i want to set there tabindex 1,2,3
[20:43:45] <joelbirch> jj_qq: I can't debug it without seeing it, do you have that fiddle ready?
[20:49:30] <jj_qq> joelbirch:  http://jsfiddle.net/DHZNv/381/
[20:49:50] <jj_qq> joelbirch:  fixed it but is not doing it right
[21:03:20] <amh345> can someone have a peek at this?  it's so messed up testing it feels like it's about to give me a seizure. http://jsfiddle.net/Qa5D3/  all thats suppose to happen is when a li is rolled over all the other lis are to animate left. then the hidden <p> is suppose to display.
[21:03:27] <amh345> but it's acting insane.
[21:06:08] <relipse> how do i enable the 'Save' button in ckeditor to save?
[21:13:34] <joelbirch> jj_qq: what calls the log() function?
[21:13:58] <joelbirch> jj_qq: ah I see it
[21:18:03] <joelbirch> jj_qq: all works for me. If it's "not doing it right" then you need to explain how you want it to behave
[21:29:15] <relipse>  i have a ckeditor 4, but when i click on the style drop down, it appears real quick then disappears, how do i fix this?
[21:29:35] <jj_qq> joelbirch: sorry.. was out. now i made some changes and is good
[21:29:49] <joelbirch> jj_qq: great :)
[21:29:58] <jj_qq> joelbirch:  also in the example where i should include .before()
[21:30:31] <joelbirch> jj_qq: just use it instead of after()
[21:31:03] <jj_qq> joelbirch:  but if i need to include an image before and after?
[21:31:24] <joelbirch> ok, just chain it after, um, after()
[21:32:49] <jj_qq> umm
[21:33:27] <joelbirch> jj_qq: .after('stuff here').before('more stuff here')
[21:33:44] <jj_qq> joelbirch:  got it.. let me try
[21:38:00] <jj_qq> joelbirch:  thanks buddy.. appreciate it
[21:38:22] <joelbirch> jj_qq: you're welcome
[21:39:48] <jj_qq> joelbirch:  also do you like The Amity Affliction ?
[21:40:03] <joelbirch> jj_qq: haha, I know I know
[21:40:15] <jj_qq> lol
[21:40:23] <jj_qq> had to ask that
[21:40:24] <joelbirch> jj_qq: pretty sure I had the name first :)
[21:58:01] <NivenHuH> question about drop events.. i have no clue why the debugger never fires on this:  http://jsbin.com/arages/2/
[22:38:12] <poopaged12> which would be the best way make a number grow bigger then back to normal every time it updates
[22:38:40] <djQuery> var x = 0;   x++ x--
[22:38:43] <djQuery> lol
[22:38:53] <djQuery> poopaged12, gonna need more than that
[22:39:00] <poopaged12> visually
[22:39:36] <djQuery> oh like a visual timer? that resets to 0 when an update occurs?
[22:40:17] <poopaged12> not a timer .. but just when the number changes its emphasized by its growing bigger
[22:40:22] <djQuery> 'http://sophilabs.github.com/jquery-counter/
[22:40:44] <djQuery> oh it increase in size as well as changing the number lol
[22:47:03] <sacrilicious> good morning
[22:47:22] <sacrilicious> is this a valid synatx  $(this).(".lick").remove(); ?
[22:47:30] <Cork> no
[22:47:36] <Cork> $(this).find()
[22:47:54] <sacrilicious> documentation for find() ?
[22:48:01] <Cork> ?.find
[22:48:01] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[22:48:23] <poopaged12> djQuery: the method i know of is .. use a css3 class that uses css3 -animation keyframe with -transform:  scale(1) then the other keyframe is scaled higher .. and use jquery to change the class then 200ms later turn off the class
[22:49:59] <poopaged12> it is not really to in elegant but just wondered if there is other ways to achieve the same effect
[22:54:39] <sacrilicious> Cork: my tree is like this, how do i delete the previous two .licks classes ? http://pastebin.com/QtnxdJ14
[22:55:20] <Cork> sacrilicious: previus?
[22:55:23] <Cork> you mean remove all of it?
[22:55:30] <sacrilicious> ya
[22:55:42] <Cork> if you remove the outer mowt lick all thats in that pb will be removed
[22:55:52] <sacrilicious> but only within $(this)
[22:55:59] <Cork> withinhttp://mirror.linux.org.au/linux.conf.au/2013/mp4/The_real_story_behind_Wayland_and_X.mp4
[22:56:00] <Cork> opps
[22:56:06] <Cork> within?
[22:56:16] <Cork> sacrilicious: what element is this?
[22:56:28] <sacrilicious> on click, i am trigering the the class add/ remove
[22:56:38] <Cork> on what element?
[22:56:51] <sacrilicious> however since there are already two .lick classes, i cannot add more
[22:56:58] <Cork> on what element?
[22:57:24] <sacrilicious> on the current element that has the .lick class
[22:57:31] <sacrilicious> there are many divs with .lick on them
[22:57:34] <Cork> uh
[22:57:53] <Cork> so when you click an element that has .lick you want to remove all element that has it?
[22:58:02] <sacrilicious> http://www.rightlick.com/ here is the website, on click  triggers that you LIKE this pi
[22:58:06] <sacrilicious> pic*
[22:58:29] <sacrilicious> notice that all have the class LICK on them
[23:00:28] <sacrilicious> Cork: you are still here ?
[23:00:41] <Cork> you still haven't explained what you want to do
[23:01:38] <sacrilicious> the issue still remains that when i click on any pic, the class .lick is added to them, if i click on them again, i need to remove the previous .lick and replace it with a new .lick class
[23:01:50] <sacrilicious> its darn confusing.... i know
[23:02:22] <Cork> uh, why do you need to remove the class, if you intend to add it again?!?
[23:02:48] <sacrilicious> because the new .lick class has a new image overlay with them
[23:03:24] <Cork> i don't follow... sorry
[23:03:33] <sacrilicious> nevermind, let it be
[23:03:38] <sacrilicious> i am moving to other bugs
[23:20:22] <someprimetime> "lick the things you like"?
[23:20:51] <danheberden> it's always worked for me
[23:20:58] <someprimetime> how well has that been translating to other languages?
[23:21:29] <danheberden> lets just say my trip to Korea ended up AMAZING because of it
