[00:04:15] <new2net> Eviltwin, I just wrote it as inline CSS and used the ID.  It's all the turkey I ate, making me sleepy hehe
[00:06:43] <pablo89pl> eh :) us thanksgiving day i forgot
[00:18:54] <barraponto> i have a variable a = '129'
[00:19:09] <barraponto> how can i get array[a] ?
[00:19:28] <barraponto> (also, what is the name of this?)
[00:19:34] <Eviltwin> array[parseInt(a)]
[00:19:55] <barraponto> Eviltwin: hm.. so the trouble was the type...
[00:20:10] <Eviltwin> Sort of
[00:20:17] <Eviltwin> "129" and 129 actually mean very different things
[00:20:33] <Eviltwin> And are stored in very different ways
[00:21:13] <beasty_> morning
[00:21:14] <beasty_> question
[00:21:21] <beasty_> i have a html block
[00:21:37] <beasty_> is there a easy way to insert that into a page ?
[00:21:41] <beasty_> i mean repeatingly ?
[00:22:07] <wookiehangover> beasty_: huh?
[00:22:16] <wookiehangover> do you need to iterate over something?
[00:22:19] <Eviltwin> beasty_: Can you give us an example of what you have and what you want?
[00:22:26] <wookiehangover> ?pask
[00:22:26] <bot-t> Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net. If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:22:43] <Eviltwin> He did ask his question
[00:23:02] <Eviltwin> More than we can say for a lot of people
[00:24:29] <barraponto> how do i check if a key exists?
[00:24:40] <barraponto> exists(array[a])?
[00:24:53] <Eviltwin> a in array
[00:25:02] <barraponto> if (a in array)
[00:25:04] <barraponto> :)
[00:25:16] <Eviltwin> Or array.hasOwnProperty(a)
[00:25:42] <barraponto> i'd expect (a in array) to look for values
[00:25:46] <barraponto> not for keys.
[00:25:53] <barraponto> (coming from python)
[00:26:17] <MatsT> When I use the selector $('#elementId') I only get the first element with that id, but when I use $('#componentId\\:elementId') I get a list with all elements. Is this intended?
[00:27:00] <Whirl3d> you should never have two elements with the same id
[00:27:18] <MatsT> I know, but primefaces apparently doesn't
[00:27:23] <beasty_> sure you would
[00:27:36] <beasty_> why the hell did they else invent classes
[00:27:50] <beasty_> so classes van be unique and id not
[00:28:07] <MatsT> the opposite actually, ids are supposed to be unique but not classes
[00:30:08] <beasty_> ever heard about sarcasm ? :p
[00:30:17] <Eviltwin> I don't think classes were invented to be a non-unique identifier...
[00:30:20] <Eviltwin> That's just how people abuse them
[00:31:35] <beasty_> Eviltwin: 'The class attribute provides a way of classifying similar elements.'
[00:31:36] <beasty_> fyi
[00:31:46] <MatsT> Either way, it still seems weird that you get a different result just because there is a colon in the id.
[00:31:59] <beasty_> just use classes
[00:33:04] <Whirl3d> MatsT, I've never seen a selector like #someid\\:elementId
[00:37:21] <MatsT> When you use jsf it prepends the parent container's ids to element ids, so it's quite common there
[00:46:16] <rethus> i have this page: http://jsfiddle.net/m2KRU/3/ and got an error for validation.js like this "Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'validate'"
[00:46:33] <rethus> but the script is loaded... anyone can tell me whats wrong here?
[00:49:01] <Xotix> How can i determine which element i've clicked if it can be in any nested structure and doesn't have a id/class. Using index() doesn't work since i need to know where exactly in the dom it is and not which index it has in its wrapping element. I just can think of adding a class like $(this).addClass('clicked'); and check it like that but maybe there is a better solution?
[00:51:33] <Xotix> rethus validate() is a plugin right? You should probably include it
[00:52:14] <rethus> Xotix: it is. but i've found the mistake. I have included jquery twice... once before and one after validate.js plugin
[00:52:26] <rethus> i removed the include after validate, and now i got no error.
[00:53:04] <Xotix> yeah, good. Anyone got a nice solution to my question?
[00:53:26] <rethus> but even if i have onsubmit="return Validate()" on my Form, it doesn't validate the form, but only submit it.
[00:53:58] <mcahornsirup1> Hi. Is there a nice way to grab an URL parameter of the current browser bar?
[00:54:08] <Xotix> rethus: i don't know validate.js.
[00:56:47] <Xotix> mcahornsirup1: window.location.href; and regex
[00:58:11] <mcahornsirup1> ok. I see. no jquery one liner this time ;)
[00:58:16] <Eviltwin> rethus: http://jsfiddle.net/m2KRU/5/
[00:58:22] <Eviltwin> rethus: You were including an old jQuery too
[00:58:39] <mcahornsirup1> thanks xotix.
[00:58:48] <rethus> i found it some time ago
[00:58:51] <Eviltwin> Xotix: Can you ask your question again?
[01:01:25] <Eviltwin> Xotix: I think I can help but I didn't entirely understand
[01:01:37] <Xotix> Eviltwin: I have content which is dynamically created. SO the structure can change to something i don't know. I know need to get the element i clicked. I've always used index() and eq() but that just gives me the index of the element within its parent. So im looking for something like a recursive index(); or any other kind of "pointer".
[01:02:26] <Eviltwin> You know "this" inside the handler is the element itself, right?
[01:03:14] <amirite> i know class selectors are faster than child selectors for browser rendering, but what about for jquery?
[01:03:29] <yan_> not sure if it's strictly jquery-related, but can someone guess why li.offsetTop (in a div > ol > li) returns offset to the top of the document, not to its 'ol' parent?
[01:03:45] <amirite> is elem.find('> .foo > .bar > .baz') faster than elem.find('.baz') ?
[01:04:09] <Eviltwin> amirite: Every successive operation in the selector slows it down
[01:04:45] <Eviltwin> amirite: For example $("table td") is faster than $("table tr td")
[01:04:52] <Xotix> Eviltwin:  yes, of course. I asked the wrong question. But you helped me by making me this clear again.
[01:05:28] <Eviltwin> Xotix: I don't understand why you're trying to get some sort of index-based pointer to the element rather than the element itself
[01:15:12] <Xotix> Eviltwin, you were right. Because i had wrnog thought, but i got an different questions. Im used to not using any kind of public style variables. So i have a plugin which enables me the ajax pic upload on double click. PLease check this pastie: http://pastebin.com/1LE1mRaY is there a better way?
[01:15:21] <Xotix> *wrong thoughts
[01:16:22] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/m2KRU/9/
[01:16:31] <rethus> the form is always valid? why?
[01:17:11] <rethus> this is an error that i don't understand
[01:18:38] <Eviltwin> Xotix: Have you looked at: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring ?
[01:18:49] <jaseemabid> rethus : wish the whole thing was in English ;p It would have been nice if you stripped the content to only whats required. I mean just the form. Less load on people who may want to help
[01:19:08] <Eviltwin> Xotix: I have a feeling the Data section is relevant to you
[01:19:10] <rethus> k, one moment
[01:20:21] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/m2KRU/10/
[01:20:26] <Xotix> Eviltwin: yes, partially. But i thought, just lets start. If it works, i'll read the stuff again, understand it better, update everything. Thanks, i'll
[01:21:04] <yan_> is there anything special that i need to know when using offsetTop (and offsets in general) and blocks that have float 'left' or 'right'? my offsets aren't exactly lining up
[01:23:17] <Eviltwin> yan_: They don't include the margins by default
[01:27:47] <suy> Does anyone know how to make this simple example work? http://pastebin.com/baS6S9ay
[01:28:38] <Eviltwin> suy: AuxiliaryFunction is defined in a closed scope
[01:28:46] <Eviltwin> It's not defined in the global scope
[01:28:53] <Eviltwin> So you can't reference it from that scope below
[01:30:06] <suy> Eviltwin: but there has to be a way for the plugin to call it in the proper scope, no?
[01:30:53] <Eviltwin> Code inside the "$.fn.ThePlugin = function(options) { ... }" can reference AuxiliaryFunction
[01:31:08] <Eviltwin> Nothing else can
[01:31:09] <bjensen> when I scroll up and down om my page..in Firefox, it feels like there are some glitchesâ€¦ any idea on how to debug this properly?
[01:31:28] <Eviltwin> bjensen: What kind of glitches?
[01:31:57] <bjensen> Eviltwin: like when I scroll down, it sometimes isn't as smooth, it kinda stops for a few milisecs and then continues to scroll down
[01:32:14] <Eviltwin> Probably means you have a laggy script firing
[01:33:46] <suy> Eviltwin: thank you very much; any idea how to redesign the plugin, then? Make the functions somehow public explicitly with $.fn.ThePlugin.Foobar = ... ?
[01:33:46] <Eviltwin> If you link the page, I can take a look
[01:33:50] <Eviltwin> See if anything stands out
[01:34:16] <bjensen> Eviltwin: sorry its on an intranet :-/
[01:34:35] <bjensen> Eviltwin: you are probably right..any tips as to how I can get to the bottom of it?
[01:34:45] <Eviltwin> suy: Have you read this? http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[01:35:32] <suy> Eviltwin: yes, it's just that the plugin has lots of internal functions, and I was trying to avoid doing it explicitly
[01:35:54] <Eviltwin> Describe your goal a bit more
[01:35:55] <suy> i was trying to find a quick way to "import" function invocations from outside
[01:37:10] <Whirl3d> if you did: $("#something").css("opacity",0).animate({opacity:0},2000);  since it is already 0 opacity, will it just  skip the animation or will it pause for 2 seconds?
[01:37:24] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: I believe it pauses for 2 seconds
[01:37:26] <Eviltwin> But
[01:37:29] <Eviltwin> ?tias
[01:37:30] <bot-t> Try It And See
[01:37:49] <suy> the plugin has functions that do calculations about a map, and I wanted to make possible that users of the plugin redefine internal functions, but those functions have to use other internal functions unfortunately
[01:38:14] <Eviltwin> Is there a reason you're trying to hook it into jQuery in that way?
[01:39:49] <risky> hi
[01:39:57] <risky> having problems with jquery validation
[01:40:19] <suy> well, the plugin creates all the boilerplate HTML and JS to make an interactive map; now the goal is making it possible to add something on top of the map, like drawing a line and saving the clicks on top of the map
[01:40:21] <risky> does jquery validation work when a html page is being echoed in PHP??
[01:41:05] <suy> risky: there should be no difference: the browser doesn't know if the page is static or dinamic
[01:41:22] <risky> hte problem I am having is that the the fields are not validating
[01:41:46] <risky> it just keeps alerting the success message, even though the fields are empty
[01:42:04] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, tias? I'm sure that would take less time than just asking someone in here...oh wait, I already got my answer...looks like the ole tias method loses again. Thanks for your reply.
[01:43:01] <Eviltwin> suy: I would try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/u2BBX/
[01:43:59] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: I gave you that answer and I said "I believe" not "it definitely does"
[01:44:03] <suy> Eviltwin: thank you very much, I will give it a try
[01:44:16] <Eviltwin> It would be a weird edge case
[01:44:19] <Eviltwin> But it's possible
[01:44:44] <Eviltwin> So I suggest you try and see before expecting it to have that behavior
[01:51:26] <Xotix> Eviltwin: Should i really data just for 1 var?
[01:52:16] <Eviltwin> If you want to do the plugin right, then yes

[02:07:02] <RyanV> it's a ruby on rails app Eviltwin.  is that supported? or should i open the localhost and just copy paste the compiled code

[02:34:29] <aaarrrggh> I'm trying to call a method on a plugin on an element that has been added after the dom has loaded. I'm aware of the live() method, but I can't seem to get this to trigger as I don't really have an 'event' as such to attach to live()... can anyone help
[02:35:01] <aaarrrggh> I'm trying to turn a multiselect into one of these: http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/ using the $(select).chosen() syntax
[02:44:28] <WasserDragoon> hi everyone, how to get the body content from my var containing html code: http://jsfiddle.net/rZa3E/
[02:44:42] <WasserDragoon> i'm always getting null
[02:47:14] <WasserDragoon> sorry this is a more minimal example http://jsfiddle.net/ejVcq/
[02:53:38] <aaarrrggh> anyone know how to call a plugin on an element added to the page after the dom is loaded?
[03:01:15] <jomofcw> Aaaarg bin the process that add this element ?
[03:01:15] <suy> aaarrrggh: don't you have any means to call the plugin after the code that adds that element?
[03:01:58] <aaarrrggh> suy:  when I try to call $('#related-products').chosen(); after the element is added to the page, nothing happens
[03:02:10] <aaarrrggh> jomofcw: ok, two secs
[03:02:42] <jomofcw> debug : console.log($('#related-products').length);
[03:04:04] <aaarrrggh> jomofcw: http://jsfiddle.net/6CmmW/
[03:04:15] <aaarrrggh> that's the ajax call that creates the html on the page
[03:04:59] <aaarrrggh> jomofcw: output of that debug statment is: 0
[03:05:31] <jomofcw> Aaaarg so here we go. You can't add anything to an element that doesn't exist. Just pastebin your code
[03:05:42] <jomofcw> OK haven't see it xD
[03:06:06] <aaarrrggh> Just pasted the code... I can paste the html output if you need that too?
[03:06:39] <aaarrrggh> I know I can attach the live() method, but I have to bind it to an event such as click, and I want it to update as soon as the element loads, not after a click event or something like that
[03:06:51] <rethus> how can i set a red border with the validate-plugin, if the insert data is wrong?
[03:06:54] <jomofcw> Aaaarg where is the call to #related-products ?
[03:08:17] <aaarrrggh> jomofcw: I'd removed that call by that point... I was just doing $('#related-products').chosen(); before the dialog.width() command
[03:09:30] <jomofcw> OK so it's normal that doesn't work
[03:09:47] <aaarrrggh> yes, but do you know how I can get around this?
[03:10:03] <jomofcw> use .ajax instead of .load
[03:10:38] <aaarrrggh> why would that work?
[03:10:39] <jomofcw> or anyway add the code in the complete function
[03:11:01] <jomofcw> Because when you call dialog.width, the content isn't loaded already in the DOM
[03:11:24] <jomofcw> add it just after the call of .dialog
[03:11:30] <jomofcw> or before anyway
[03:11:35] <jomofcw> same for the dialog.width
[03:13:13] <aaarrrggh> but dialog.load() is the call that loads the element I'm trying to work with
[03:13:33] <jomofcw> not a prob aaarrrggh :)
[03:13:35] <choichoi> hi
[03:13:58] <jomofcw> aaarrrggh the content is loaded when this function is call
[03:14:38] <aaarrrggh> jomofcw: I don't understand how to fix it, sorry
[03:14:43] <aaarrrggh> I'm not sure what you're asking me to do
[03:15:05] <jomofcw> pastebin your code withe the #related-products please
[03:15:09] <jomofcw> and all the stuff you need
[03:15:13] <jomofcw> and I show you
[03:15:39] <aaarrrggh> jomofcw:  it works now, thanks :)
[03:16:21] <aaarrrggh> I was just getting a bit confused... but I stuck the $('#related-products').chosen(); call in before the dialog.dialog() call, and it works now :)
[03:16:50] <jomofcw> Yea work too
[03:16:58] <jomofcw> But not the best way to do it
[03:17:01] <jomofcw> nvm, it works.
[03:18:05] <aaarrrggh> out of interest, why is this not the best way to do it?
[03:18:42] <jomofcw> Because you should understand how AJAX work
[03:18:58] <jomofcw> and why asynchroneous isn't linear
[03:19:41] <jomofcw> And for example, you change width to 75%, but you do it when the dialog element is empty (and the dialog plugin isn't apply already).
[03:20:10] <aaarrrggh> jomofcw: I think my own code formatting was partly to blame... I actually thought I was calling $('#related-products').chosen(); on the success callback method of the .load() method... my own formatting is to blame for that
[03:23:35] <aaarrrggh> anyway, thank you for your kind help :)
[03:35:28] <minna> Hi, anyone with ajaxpro or ajax datatype experience?
[03:36:40] <minna> I think i'm getting a response that is an array, but script. So the second array is XML but all new lines, spaces, etc are escaped. I don't know how to format this to proper xml?
[03:38:17] <minna> The response looks like this: [0, "all of the html"];/*
[03:41:20] <Cork> minna: array, but script?
[03:41:24] <Cork> what do you mean?
[03:43:21] <minna> Cork: I don't know what to call it, the server returns text in the header. I tried setting dataType to html, but i still get text back. Maybe it's javascript object's im getting back?
[03:43:37] <minna> Hm, no, maybe not. Geesh, this is difficult.
[03:44:26] <minna> The response looks like this: [0, "all of the html here, JS escaped"];/*
[03:46:49] <Cork> minna: so its an array with two values
[03:46:56] <Cork> followed by a start comment
[03:47:30] <jorisw> Anyone know anything about the tablesorter plugin? I can't get it to do anything, though it does initialize and doesn't throw or cause any errors.
[03:47:42] <Cork> minna: but what is it your trying to do?
[03:47:45] <jorisw> It won't do debug either
[03:48:42] <minna> Cork: I wan't to search the response html for a div, then insert the div into the page. But the response is not html or xml, so i can't access it. I need to convert it or use it differently, but i don't know how.
[03:49:24] <Cork> minna: $(response[1]).find('element your looking for') ?
[03:49:52] <minna> Cork: I tried that, then it returns one character only. It's like every character in the response is an array :-S
[03:49:54] <Cork> minna: html isn't converted to dom automatically
[03:50:26] <Cork> minna: create a pasebin with example data
[03:50:35] <Cork> as its getting to the script
[03:52:19] <ank> hy, I want to track the textfeild value change event in both cases, when changed by user interface and by javascript
[03:52:28] <ank> How to do that?
[03:53:06] <ank> hy, I want to track the textfeild value change event in both cases, when changed by user interface and by javascript ?
[03:53:17] <jorisw> ank: interesting question. I feel like you'll need to trigger the event every time you change it from JS
[03:53:39] <Cork> ank: by script isn't really posible that doesn't create dom events
[03:55:29] <minna> Cork: Here is the response. http://pastebin.com/GkR2WMGZ
[03:55:43] <Cork> ank: best option would prob be to use a wrapper function for updating the value, and then use that to track its script changes
[03:56:08] <Cork> minna: what type is you loading this as?
[03:56:16] <Cork> it should be loaded as json
[03:56:33] <minna> Ok, i changed to json
[03:56:52] <Cork> then its an array where [1] is the html
[03:56:58] <minna> Hm.
[03:57:00] <Cork> that needs to be put into $()
[03:57:08] <Cork> and you should be game
[03:57:46] <Cork> but the comment at the end scares me
[03:58:05] <Cork> cause thats not valid in json, so if its really there, it will fail to parse
[03:59:57] <minna> Cork: I think it does fail: var $content = $(response[1]).find('#content'); console.log($content); returns nothing.
[04:00:18] <Cork> minna: do an console.log(resonse[1]
[04:00:21] <Cork> )
[04:01:17] <minna> Cork: I get undefined
[04:01:49] <Cork> how do the callback look like, for the ajax call?
[04:02:30] <Cork> how... bah whats with my english to day...
[04:02:33] <minna> Cork: You wan't the headers or the jquery?
[04:02:38] <Cork> *what does the callback look like
[04:02:49] <Cork> minna: no your callback where you get the data
[04:03:03] <Cork> the function(<variable name>)
[04:03:23] <minna> success: function(response) {	console.log(response[1]); }
[04:03:33] <Cork> interesting
[04:03:53] <Cork> ok, remove [1] and copy whats put in the console
[04:04:09] <Cork> just the first say 5 characters is ok
[04:04:15] <Cork> but don't skip anything
[04:05:14] <Cork> minna: it looks like your getting the data in a format that isn't json
[04:05:23] <Cork> but i'm not sure what
[04:05:57] <minna> Hm, i get an object i think
[04:06:09] <Cork> object?
[04:06:18] <Cork> the console doesn't say what the object is??
[04:06:53] <minna> Cork: Yeah, nothing was printed into console. I get a tree windows > Object it says in navigation in firebug when i click it
[04:07:29] <minna> responseText, and if i click that in the tree, it has the response.
[04:07:56] <Cork> minna: ya, the inspect should be in the tree structure
[04:08:20] <Cork> but its displayed as [0, ""] still or ?
[04:08:45] <minna> Yes, the responseText is still the same response. With the ugly comment at the end
[04:08:53] <Cork> no not responseText
[04:09:06] <Cork> that console.log puts in the console
[04:09:13] <Cork> thats what matter
[04:09:15] <Cork> +s
[04:09:34] <Cork> ok lets to it his way instead
[04:09:44] <Cork> console.log(typeof(response));
[04:10:04] <Cork> and console.log(response.length);
[04:10:21] <minna> typeof prints object
[04:10:48] <minna> .length prints undefined
[04:11:13] <Cork> and the first one?
[04:11:27] <minna> console.log(typeof(response)); prints object
[04:11:34] <minna> nothing else but object
[04:13:28] <ank> @jorisw and @cork thanks for your kind help
[04:15:05] <kai> hi folks
[04:15:09] <aaronmcadam> could try instanceof
[04:15:19] <aaronmcadam> or just noty typeof at all, it's gonna be useless
[04:17:26] <minna> Cork: Should i give up?
[04:19:21] <larsemil> $('#contactwrapper .personscroller ul li:first').after($('#contactwrapper .personscroller ul li:last'));
[04:19:30] <larsemil> seems like this one does not work.. :/
[04:19:48] <larsemil> or works bad.
[04:19:55] <larsemil> http://newteknikdalen.destinator.se/814.php
[04:20:05] <minna> Cork: Maybe i can use slice to fix it?
[04:20:07] <risky> hi
[04:20:15] <larsemil> try picking a name down in the list, and see that got to much offset
[04:20:25] <risky> how do I set the value of a variable from jQuery to a html <p>?
[04:20:36] <risky> e.g. var t = 6
[04:26:49] <Cork> minna: looks like you have an object outside your array
[04:27:27] <Cork> minna: but its almost imposible for me to tell without getting the raw response from the server, parsed and filtered i can only guess
[04:28:01] <minna> Cork: That is the raw response, unfortunately.
[04:28:31] <Cork> oh wait... gah i'm stupid...
[04:28:42] <Cork> array is displayed as objects, forgot that >_<
[04:29:06] <minna> So, the entire block becomes an array.
[04:29:19] <Cork> minna: do console.log(response.constructor.name)
[04:29:51] <Cork> minna: what you showed before should be an array if it parses successfully
[04:30:14] <minna> Cork: It returns Object
[04:32:11] <Cork> minna: then do console.log(Object.keys(response));
[04:32:57] <minna> Cork: Oh my... ["readyState", "setRequestHeader", "getAllResponseHeaders", "getResponseHeader", "overrideMimeType", "abort", "done", "fail", "progress", "state", "isResolved", "isRejected", "then", "always", "pipe", "promise", "success", "error", "complete", "statusCode", "responseText", "status", "statusText"]
[04:33:15] <Cork> uh... thats not the response thats the xhr objet
[04:33:57] <minna> Cork: xhr object?
[04:34:31] <Cork> XmlHttpResponse
[04:34:43] <Cork> its the ajax connection object, not the result from the call
[04:35:04] <Cork> what command did you say you used?
[04:35:18] <Cork> the first argument for success should be data not xhr
[04:36:22] <minna> command?
[04:36:39] <Cork> your calling $.ajax or what?
[04:36:54] <minna> Yes. But it's a .net server, so i had to set headers.
[04:37:30] <minna> Cork: beforeSend: function(xhr) {  xhr.setRequestHeader("X-AjaxPro-Method", method);	  xhr.setRequestHeader("X-Requested-With", "XMLHttpRequest"); },
[04:37:31] <Cork> and your using jquery's ajax function and not something else?
[04:37:38] <minna> Yeah.
[04:37:45] <Cork> wierd
[04:38:12] <minna> Maybe it's the requestheader that's wrong?
[04:38:36] <Cork> that shouldn't change the argument order for success...
[04:38:38] <minna> But i'm using the same response and request header as the original JS that was making this call.
[04:39:39] <Cork> well you can work around it, just feels like a waist to do all the extra work
[04:39:43] <minna> Cork: I don't know if it helps, but the original script uses prototype and ajaxpro.
[04:40:04] <Cork> minna: is any of those loaded?
[04:40:16] <minna> Cork: Yeah, they are.
[04:40:38] <Cork> do you get the same effect if you call jQuery.ajax instead of $.ajax?
[04:40:46] <minna> Can try
[04:41:21] <minna> Yeah, the exact same.
[04:41:33] <minna> When i use the original script's i get the same response too.
[04:41:43] <minna> But there, it actually works and replaces the whole page.
[04:41:46] <Cork> ya, it looks like the same functions are called
[04:42:08] <Cork> cause the response you get isn't what a jquery success call should look like...
[04:42:20] <Cork> its weird
[04:42:40] <minna> Hm, is there any way to override or  remove the original script's?
[04:43:06] <Cork> remove the script tags so they arn't loaded?
[04:43:25] <minna> Cork: Can't do that, they are loaded serverside.
[04:43:33] <Cork> ya?
[04:43:40] <kai> I seem to be unable to successfully write jQuery code using jsonp to get data. http://jsfiddle.net/yVbYQ/2072/ <-- anything obviously wrong there?
[04:43:46] <minna> Yeah, so i don't have access to those files.
[04:43:53] <Cork> ouch
[04:43:56] <minna> :-(
[04:43:56] <johnp_> hi
[04:44:10] <johnp_> i am trying to generate to random numbers for a captcha
[04:44:18] <johnp_> and am using the plugin
[04:44:32] <Cork> minna: jquery shouldn't normally get these problems, its quite well capsulated, but... not sure what goes wrong
[04:45:05] <minna> Cork: I could run this call, then return the page again using jquery, and use jquery to replace the elements. It would be two calls made, but atleast it won't replace the whole page.
[04:45:42] <minna> Like 25kb wasted
[04:46:13] <minna> Cork: The point was to post the json, so the change get's activated serverside.
[04:46:22] <minna> Cork: Then process the response.
[04:50:17] <minna> Cork: Thanks for helping out, really appriciate it.
[04:50:18] <Cork> kai: http://jsfiddle.net/yVbYQ/2073/
[04:51:20] <Cork> minna: you could reparse the response and get around it that way
[04:51:41] <Cork> $(JSON.parse(xhr.responceText)[1])
[04:52:59] <minna> Cork: I checked the element that triggers the ajax call, and there's no bound event listeners, because i removed them. So only jquery should be making the call
[04:53:39] <Cork> minna: what i meant is it looks like theres a function colition somewhere
[04:54:16] <minna> Cork: I get xhr is not defined?
[04:54:32] <Cork> minna: its the variable you called response but isn't
[04:55:12] <minna> Cork: I changed that to responseText
[04:55:14] <Cork> minna: this is why i say this is something wrong "success(data, textStatus, jqXHR)" => http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[04:55:25] <Cork> minna: ah sorry type
[04:55:31] <Cork> *typo
[04:55:32] <fff> hi
[04:59:38] <minna> Cork: Type?
[05:03:54] <minna> Cork: Doesn't look like json to me?
[05:04:14] <kai> Cork: Ok, so I seem to be doing this completely wrong. the real dataset I have looks like: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/512778/
[05:05:04] <kai> and I want to grab those two lists and use them in another function call
[05:18:46] <negev> hi, is it possible using jquery or just javascript to send a pdf document directly to the printer via the browser, or would you have to load it in the browser first and have the user manually select Print?
[05:23:05] <_thumper_> Hey. I am looking for a way to display a simple message at the top of the screen that the user can close
[05:23:23] <_thumper_> Is there some similar Jquery function?
[05:25:23] <call5> hello

[05:44:43] <doktorj> hi.  if i can find the proper selector for the first input in this html fragment: https://gist.github.com/1393557 and it's in $$(this) - how can i figure out the value of the next input with the class "hasDatePicker" ?
[05:45:17] <doktorj> ignore the double $$
[05:45:46] <doktorj> i need something like this:   psaDate = $(this).find('.hasDatePicker').val()   but that's not working

[05:51:05] <MariusKarthaus> Hi, I'm having some issues with draggable/droppable. I have an UL with LI in it. Lhe LI contain several spans. On of the spans is a text that I want to drag and drop on another span. The problem is with the allinment of the cursor. I've prepared a trimmed down example here if anyone would care to take a look:  https://phpide.net/test.php  The problem is that the center of the draggable must hover the droppable, but this is not
[05:51:05] <MariusKarthaus> intuitive because the cursor is somewhere else. Also when there is a big difference in width for the drag and the drop items, dropping becomes impossible. Does anyone know what I can do about this ?
[05:53:16] <MariusKarthaus> in the example the problem becomes really obvious when you try to drag "A_long_file_name_just_for_testing.css" on top of "d1"
[05:53:37] <marekweb> MariusKarthaus: You might be looking for the "tolerance" option in droppable
[05:55:50] <MariusKarthaus> marekweb: thank you!!. Where were you the last two hours of my life :P
[05:56:36] <marekweb> MariusKarthaus: no problem
[05:59:35] <doktorj> anyone know how to find the next text input boxed based on $(this).  ?
[06:00:03] <hrwath> doktorj, $(this).next('input[type=text]);
[06:00:14] <Trisox> find :first next ect
[06:00:14] <hrwath> oops forgot the closing '
[06:00:27] <Trisox> :input :P
[06:00:27] <doktorj> oooh
[06:00:39] <Trisox> ?nextAll
[06:00:43] <Trisox> ?next
[06:00:52] <Guest82370> hi!
[06:01:03] <Guest82370> what the ... with the guest thing
[06:01:04] <hrwath> bot's off duty ;-)
[06:01:27] <Bartmax> ? next
[06:04:06] <doktorj> hrwath: hmm that just gives me undefined when i go: psaDate = $(this).next('input[type=input]').val()
[06:04:12] <doktorj> (using coffeescript btw)
[06:04:41] <doktorj> the hml looks like this: https://gist.github.com/1393557
[06:05:24] <doktorj> and i have selected the first text input, and have it in $(this), but i need to then get the text value of the next text input
[06:05:41] <hrwath> doktorj, and what's this in your case?
[06:05:44] <doktorj> i don't understand why it's not super easy to do that
[06:05:55] <doktorj> this is .psaInputs
[06:06:11] <doktorj> #psaInput-1
[06:06:13] <doktorj> same thing
[06:06:34] <risky> im trying to due a multiply captcha with two numbers for jquery validaiton
[06:06:50] <risky> however even with the correct value it still shows incorrect message
[06:07:15] <risky> ive done if(total != q) { return false; }
[06:07:26] <risky> total being the value of the input field
[06:07:40] <risky> and q being the total of the two numbers
[06:20:49] <Foxandxss> Is there a jquery plugin that validates a string like a date? So if I pass it something like "dd/mm/yyyy" it says correct, or "dd.mm.yyyy" if its a german date.
[06:20:50] <phrearch> hello
[06:21:00] <phrearch> i wonder how to loop over a regular javascript object's key values
[06:21:10] <phrearch> $.each doesnt seem to work on a {}
[06:24:02] <MariusKarthaus> phrearch: try $.each(a,function(k,v){
[06:24:49] <MariusKarthaus> where a is your object. That will work. I find this very counter intuitve too because $(a).each(function(){}) will *not* work and you'd expect the two to be the same
[06:26:18] <phrearch> MariiusKarthaus: somehow it only works if i define a prototype.size for Object
[06:26:50] <phrearch> http://pastebin.ca/2095856
[06:28:08] <MariusKarthaus> phrearch: and the each that is giving you problems is on line 24 ?
[06:28:29] <phrearch> yea, somehow my venues object doesnt have length/size
[06:28:31] <minna> I'm trying to check agains an ajax response, but all i get is response.match not a function? var falseResponse = response.match(/\[false/);
[06:28:37] <phrearch> so each doesnt work
[06:29:04] <MariusKarthaus> phrearch: in your case what I said is the reverse :P try $('table tr td:first-child').each(function());
[06:29:36] <Bartmax> can I bind to an option when it's selected?
[06:29:44] <Bartmax> or should i bind to the select change ?
[06:30:18] <MariusKarthaus> in jqeury there are two types of  each(). one for jqeury selection objects $(selector).each() and one for objects and arrays "$.each (object_or_array, function(){})"
[06:30:23] <MariusKarthaus> they do not mix
[06:30:45] <hrwath> Bartmax, well the element is being changed is select so it should be bound to select
[06:31:04] <hrwath> s/is//
[06:31:12] <Bartmax> hrwath: ok.
[06:31:22] <Bartmax> the option change to from unselected to :selected
[06:31:34] <Bartmax> to = too
[06:31:42] <hrwath> so $('select').change(...)
[06:32:16] <hrwath> Bartmax, option's attribute is being changed
[06:32:29] <hrwath> what means -> select's value is being changed
[06:32:44] <Bartmax> ok
[06:32:47] <Bartmax> thxs
[06:33:37] <hrwath> Bartmax, <option>s are list of possible choices - you do not act on them
[06:34:02] <hrwath> no probs
[06:35:44] <minna> Nvm, was doing the right thing.
[06:35:52] <minna> Just the wrong content type
[06:37:24] <minna> Cork: The response is gzip encoded, can that have anything to do with it?
[06:41:14] <Bartmax> damn, i have something not working. pasted into jsfiddler and works
[06:41:17] <Bartmax> wtf? :D
[06:41:33] <minna> Hm, no, gzip is handled automatically
[06:45:38] <TheCerbere> Hi, i would like to developp some applications with jquery mobile. Does any one know a good IDE with emulator of a phone. I m sorry my english is not very good
[06:48:29] <doktorj> anyone know why  $(this).next('input[type=text]').val() won't select the next text input val
[06:48:31] <doktorj> ?
[06:49:08] <doktorj> $(this) is a selected  object of a text input a few div's before it
[06:58:02] <ajpiano> ?next2 @ doktorj
[06:58:02] <bot-t> doktorj, .next("selector") is not "magically find the next element anywhere in the DOM that matches the selector". .next() looks at an element's next immediate sibling and then filters it by the selector. You might want to try .nextAll("selector").first(). (Note: .prev and .prevAll work the same way)
[06:59:27] <phrearch> sight
[06:59:30] <phrearch> im lost on this one
[06:59:30] <phrearch> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/512821/
[06:59:30] <doktorj> yea i think if just figured it out
[06:59:33] <doktorj> thanx tho bot-t
[06:59:46] <phrearch> if i loop over the venues var, i only get foo and bar
[07:00:00] <phrearch> not the list of items thats generated in the xhr calls
[07:00:21] <doktorj> i used this instead: (coffeescript) psaDate = $('.grid_5.omega.date').find('.hasDatePicker').first().val()
[07:02:17] <Mkop> is it dangerous to do $(this).data('original',$(this).clone());? will it cause memory leaks or the like?
[07:11:33] <__pao__> $([$('foo'), $('bar')])   <- how do I do that? (pls note that $('foo') and bar are placeholders for jquery objects I get as parameters)
[07:15:49] <MagmaRules> Guys im using jquery 1.7 and outerHeight() is not including the element padding. Is this a bug? Not working on FF 8 or Chrome 16
[07:25:24] <Olorin-> Hello people, I've made a nice plugin but don't know where to share, nor whether a similar plugin exists. Mind taking a look? http://www.swook.net/p/jquerydynload-linkjs.html
[07:26:46] <howjquery> Hi to all i new jquery ,For label i want to add span with some class   for below html.
[07:26:48] <howjquery> <label id="htone" for="radioa"  role="button" ><span class="some-class">Australia</span></label>
[07:26:50] <howjquery> i tried doing this
[07:26:51] <howjquery>                       var htone = $("#htone").text();
[07:26:53] <howjquery> 			if(htone){
[07:26:54] <howjquery> 			   $("#htone").text().add("<span>").addClass("ui-button-text");			
[07:26:56] <howjquery> 			}
[07:28:48] <Segaja> hi, i have a bunch of forms on my page and a $('form').submit(...) handler call on document ready. later on a few more forms are added an they should also have this handler. is there some way to make jquery attach it to the new elements when they are added to the page?
[07:30:29] <Mkop> ?on @ Segaja
[07:30:29] <bot-t> Segaja, The new jQuery 1.7+ way of handling events: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:30:37] <Segaja> hm, it works with live() but not with on
[07:31:19] <Mkop> I'm not really familiar with the differences between live/on, but if you figured out to use live(), you're on the right track
[07:31:22] <choichoi> hi
[07:31:52] <Segaja> Mkop: according to the doc .on() is the new way and .live() the old
[07:32:14] <choichoi> is it possible to add a trigger on javascript global var ? like $(window.title).change(....) ?
[07:32:50] <Segaja> ok, i found it
[07:34:13] <Segaja> $('form').live('submit', function() {...}); is bound to all forms found at any time in the document. $('form').on('submit', function() { ... }); is bind to only the forms at execution time and all there children. so if under a form, another form gets added it works
[07:34:38] <datlap> i have 2 divs a,b. div a has ajax pagination which loads new data when user clicks on next and div b has a map of that data using load(). what is the best way to call load() whenever user clicks next?
[07:34:41] <ajpiano> Segaja: the way to emulate live using on is $(document).on("submit", "form", fn);
[07:34:47] <Segaja> so the solution is $('body').on('submit', 'form', function () { .. });
[07:35:02] <Segaja> ajpiano: i found that out with 'body'
[07:35:07] <Segaja> but the effect is the same
[07:35:34] <ajpiano> ok
[07:37:08] <krogant> qq: wanting to fade in a css bg color from nothing to yellow and back out - is .animate with a complete function the only solution?
[07:39:14] <rethus> i use this plugin: http://jquerycustomselectbox.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/WebRoot/password_strength/password_strength_plugin.js  how can i use the first var's (shortPass, badPass and so on...) out of my sourcecode?
[07:45:43] <Foxandxss> I have a form inside a jquery ui dialog and I want to submit it when I click on the dialog accept button
[07:45:43] <Foxandxss> how?
[07:52:15] <NoiseEee> $('#yourFormID').submit();
[08:11:16] <datlap> in my <body> i have a div <div id="lat" data-lat="{{ lat}}"></div> which is in a for loop. how can i retrieve this value one by one in my javascript?
[08:14:24] <asdf`> datlap, the documentation provides an example - http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/elements.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-*-attributes
[08:14:31] <asdf`> (ctrl+f "spaceship")
[08:14:57] <asdf`> datlap, also, note that in this way you'd be setting the same id to multiple elements, which is, afair, incorrect
[08:16:42] <Mkop> is there a way to trigger a function to fire _after_ jquery-ui tabs finishes switching?
[08:17:00] <Mkop> apparently when the tabselect handler fires, the old tab is still selected
[08:17:42] <asdf`> Mkop, what about the tabsshow handler?
[08:18:15] <jobin> can anyone explain to me a problem I simply dont understand with jquery if I explain the issue??
[08:18:19] <Mkop> asdf`: is that in the documentation?
[08:18:54] <asdf`> Mkop, http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tabs under "Events"
[08:19:47] <Mkop> what is the difference between the documentation on api.jquery.com/UI vs. jqueryui.com?
[08:20:33] <ajpiano> the docs on jqueryui.com are actually pulled from docs.jquery.com/UI
[08:20:40] <ajpiano> so they're basically the same
[08:20:50] <ajpiano> just presented differently
[08:20:52] <ajpiano> IIRC
[08:21:32] <Mkop> and apparently, in this case, missing stuff
[08:21:46] <ajpiano> which one
[08:21:48] <Mkop> the tabshow handler is not mentioned on http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/
[08:21:54] <asdf`> Mkop, http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#event-show
[08:22:10] <Mkop> gosh. am I retarded?
[08:33:00] <datlap> asdf':  i use $('#ajax_table_result').html(table); which loads the table w/ new data. then i tried document.getElementById('lat') to get the new lat but it doesn't work. any idea?
[08:34:35] <Mkop> why document.getElementById('lat') rather than $("#lat")?
[08:38:48] <Prot> anyone know why the include many plugin was removed from jquery plugins?
[08:38:58] <Prot> its the only dynamic js include script I can find
[08:39:30] <Hornet> http://www.dressedondeck.com/test.php
[08:40:00] <Hornet> having an odd issue with the three boxes in the footer - move your mouse over them rapidly, the popdown tip 'jams' sometimes
[08:40:18] <Prot> Hornet: gotta watch your animations
[08:40:23] <Hornet> I'd guess it's due to the .stop() making it take that as the new reference point to scroll it to?
[08:40:27] <datlap> MKop: i tried console.log($("#lat").data("lat")); but it prints out the 1st elem of the old table instead of the 1st elem of the new table (which i load via ajax)
[08:40:32] <Hornet> yus I know, but not sure of the right pattern to use
[08:40:39] <Hornet> without the .stop() it'll queue them
[08:40:58] <Mkop> datlap: do you have to $("#lat")s?
[08:41:00] <Mkop> two*
[08:41:19] <Hornet> maybe check the event target to force one event of each type per hover, prot?
[08:41:24] <Hornet> not sure, any advice?
[08:41:29] <Prot> go simpler
[08:41:34] <Hornet> such as?
[08:41:35] <Prot> looks like you're allowing all 3 to activate at once
[08:41:41] <Prot> how about a single script that controls which is showing
[08:41:44] <Mkop> datlap: first of all, you shouldn't have duplicate ids
[08:41:56] <Mkop> datlap: second of all, you can do $('#ajax_table_result').find("#lat")
[08:42:34] <Hornet> prot, that's the desired appearance
[08:43:29] <Hornet> I know this is possible to do, but not sure how exactly
[08:46:45] <minna> I have an array filled with escaped html, how do i unescape the html?
[08:47:08] <Hornet> http://www.dressedondeck.com/test.php <-- updated now, any further ideas?
[08:47:18] <charged> good afternoon
[08:47:19] <Prot> minna $(html)
[08:47:29] <Hornet> it's not due to bubbling firing the in/out events twice
[08:48:16] <Prot> actually if its still encoded in your string http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1912501/unescape-html-entities-in-javascript
[08:48:25] <ravenzz> unescape()
[08:48:54] <Prot> ravenzz: thats something else
[08:49:10] <charged> any good way to create a zoomIn zoomOut effect on jquery?
[08:49:20] <ravenzz> she got an escape() D string i guess
[08:49:22] <charged> animate width for instance?
[08:50:32] <ajpiano> Hornet: i have an idea
[08:50:51] <ajpiano> Hornet: in 1.7 we much improved the way toggle animations work with regard to state tracking
[08:51:17] <ajpiano> i might try dropping in 1.7.1, and then consolidating the hover handler into one function and using some flavour of slideToggle
[08:53:36] <ravenzz> isn't better to use mouseenter/mouseout ?
[08:53:50] <ajpiano> mouseleave?
[08:53:54] <ravenzz> yep sorry
[08:53:55] <datlap> MKop:  i don't want to have dup id. i just don't know what is a good way to retrieve the value of div ="lat" when user clicks on next and retrieves the new table
[08:54:15] <Prot> better to use just mouseenter
[08:54:18] <ajpiano> $("foo").hover(fn) is literally the exact same thing as $("foo").bind("mouseenter mouseleave", fn), ravenzz
[08:54:21] <ravenzz> i just waked up
[08:54:22] <Prot> and disable the non active animations
[08:54:27] <Mkop> replace the old table with the new table. don't keep the old table hanging around in the DOM
[08:55:16] <ravenzz> ajpiano doesn't that 'trigger' the mousemove as well?
[08:55:26] <Hornet> ajpiano: does slidetoggle behave with multiple firings, eg as we'd see here?
[08:55:27] <ajpiano> wat
[08:55:33] <ajpiano> Hornet: yes, that's the idea
[08:55:40] <Hornet> ah, capital
[08:55:42] <Hornet> cheers :)
[08:55:58] <ajpiano> ravenzz: did you just ask me if binding a handler to mouseenter and mouseleave triggers a mousemove event
[08:56:21] <ravenzz> I am not sure about what I am saying..but I can remember that I got issues with hover() while I was moving the mouse over elements
[08:56:52] <ajpiano> it's people like you who caused the war in iraq
[08:57:00] <ravenzz> lmao
[08:57:32] <ravenzz> infact any sentence was a question..
[08:57:41] <ravenzz> so we are still in peace
[08:59:20] <Mkop> huh? what just happened here?
[09:00:57] <datlap> Mkop: i have a <td> {{lat}}</td> and there are n rows in a for loop. how can i retrieve each lat in my .js function?
[09:01:06] <Mkop> anyone know of a good alternative to dynatree? it is cool but too powerful and is pissing me off
[09:01:19] <Mkop> datlap: use class="lat" instead of id="lat"
[09:02:22] <ajpiano> Mkop: you should try the jqwidgets one ;p

[09:09:12] <datlap> Mkop: what is the jquery that retrieves the value of a <div class="lat">value</div>
[09:09:25] <howjquery> i am trying get the autocomplete value from one input to radio input,which i am able got it, but it removes the span of radio button to how to add span to input label text with some class?
[09:10:02] <ajpiano> datlap: see ?text
[09:10:02] <bot-t> datlap, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[09:10:05] <Mkop> datlap: I dare you to find the answer yourself on api.jquery.com. You'll do better having a basic knowledge of selectors that isn't spoon-fed to you.
[09:10:12] <Mkop> if you have trouble finding it, let me know
[09:10:34] <ajpiano> sorry Mkop :x
[09:10:39] <Mkop> oh, that's what you mean....
[09:10:50] <Mkop> I thought he was asking for the $(".lat") selector
[09:11:27] <Mkop> ajpiano: is there a text selector? other than :contains()?
[09:11:32] <Mkop> I couldn't find one
[09:11:34] <ajpiano> nope
[09:11:51] <Mkop> I end up going with [value='...'] which worked in context
[09:12:23] <ajpiano> i don't find that one often has to select elements by their value attribute
[09:15:00] <Mkop> ajpiano: http://pastebin.com/nPDyktgT
[09:15:20] <Mkop> the selector in question is on line 34
[09:18:52] <ajpiano> what exactly is this trying to accomplish
[09:19:01] <ajpiano> btw, don't use size, use .length
[09:20:48] <Whirl3d> If I preload a bunch of images, can I store them an element's data object without adding them to the dom?
[09:22:35] <NoiseEee> like base-64 encoded?
[09:23:31] <Whirl3d> NoiseEee, were you asking me?
[09:23:37] <NoiseEee> yes Whirl3d
[09:23:38] <Mkop> ajpiano: it's hard to explain the full context. basically, users can run reports. we are giving them the ability to do a join and now, to do aggregate statistics on that join. think SELECT tbl1.col, count(*) from tbl1 JOIN tbl2 GROUP by tbl1.col. The point of "Left "+text or "Right "+text is to let them choose whether it'll run on tbl1.col or tbl2.col
[09:23:58] <Mkop> thanks for the tip about .length
[09:24:21] <ajpiano> Mkop: i'd probably approach that with a radio button than trying to modify and create the new options on the fly
[09:24:23] <NoiseEee> Whirl3d: anyways, by 'data object' you mean an elements data- attribute?
[09:24:26] <ajpiano> maybe?
[09:25:01] <Whirl3d> NoiseEee, thx for the reply. I mean like: var image=new Image(), $img=$(image); $(sel).data("image",$img);
[09:25:25] <Mkop> ajpiano: that's how I did it initially, but this actually ends up working better to help with the mental model we want to enforce
[09:25:42] <geekbuntu> gnarf, you around?
[09:25:51] <NoiseEee> Whirl3d: did you try?
[09:26:15] <Mkop> when they run the join report in the first place, it comes out with columns such as ["Common MRN", "Left Item", "Left Value", "Right Item", "Right Value"] so having those same names in the dropdown is good
[09:26:20] <Whirl3d> Yes, mixed results....so I am not sure if it's my files or if it's just not a good idea.
[09:26:39] <NoiseEee> Whirl3d: im not sure what its going to get you if it did work, ie: the point :)
[09:27:58] <NoiseEee> Whirl3d: anyways, the docs say "allows us to attach data of any type to DOM elements " but the examples are all strings, and tbh i haven't really played with it at all
[09:28:12] <Whirl3d> I have a series of anchor elements that when moused over, an image is supposed to appear (floating above the page). I thought I would preload the images, store them in the anchor's data attribute and then append them only when moused over.
[09:28:36] <NoiseEee> Whirl3d: why not just keep them in a JS object with your element ID as a key or something?
[09:28:39] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: you can do that, and it should work
[09:28:44] <NoiseEee> or that ^^
[09:28:45] <ajpiano> NoiseEee: you can use any type of data with .data
[09:29:00] <NoiseEee> word thanks
[09:29:02] <ajpiano> fn string obj array etc
[09:29:21] <Mkop> ajpiano: is "if (left.length>0)" the best way to test if a selector found anything?
[09:29:32] <ajpiano> no just if (foo.length)
[09:29:37] <Whirl3d> thanks, NoiseEee, ajpiano
[09:29:38] <ajpiano> 0 coerces to bool false everything else true
[09:29:50] <gnarf> geekbuntu, sup
[09:30:30] <Mkop> if (!foo.length) console.log("foo not found!"); if (foo.length) console.log('foo found!party!');
[09:30:56] <ajpiano> yep
[09:31:09] <ravenzz> if / else
[09:31:13] <geekbuntu> hey gnarf - thought i had missed you - pm'd
[09:31:16] <glauco29> hi
[09:31:28] <ravenzz> if (foo.length) { bingo(); }
[09:31:38] <ravenzz> else { fail(); }
[09:32:27] <Mkop> ajpiano: so those were the only WTFs in my code? not too bad then....
[09:32:39] <ajpiano> Mkop: in general i find it a little... loops
[09:32:40] <ajpiano> loopy
[09:32:50] <Mkop> meaning...
[09:33:14] <ajpiano> i just would probably approach the problem differently if i was starting it from scratch
[09:33:48] <glauco29> I was using $(selector).live('click', function()...., now jQuery 1.7.1 says to use .on(), but, how Can I use live with click event, I have already seen .on('live') and .on('click'), but I wanna use live together click
[09:34:07] <ajpiano> wtf is .on("live")
[09:34:25] <ajpiano> glauco29: it's $(document).on("click", "selector", fn);
[09:34:31] <ajpiano> for a "live" click
[09:35:02] <Jayflux> ajpiano i can see the logic of .on() replacing .delegate and .live() but why does it need to replace .bind() ?
[09:35:07] <datlap> Mkop:  i have   $('#ajax_table_result').html(table);val=$('div.latvis').text() ; but val still shows value of the old table. any idea?
[09:35:17] <ajpiano> because if you omit the selector it does what bind does
[09:35:36] <Jayflux> ajpiano fair enough but you can still carry on using bind?
[09:35:41] <ajpiano> yes
[09:35:45] <Jayflux> or the .click shortcuts
[09:35:46] <ajpiano> if you love bind so much why don't you marry it
[09:35:51] <ajpiano> yep
[09:35:54] <Whirl3d> here's another weird one. If I store an image in an element's data attribute, then append the image to the dom and later remove it using .remove(), is it gone from the element's data attribute or only the dom?
[09:36:02] <Jayflux> well i don't actually use bind ajpiano i use the shortcuts
[09:36:03] <Jayflux> ol
[09:36:05] <Jayflux> lol
[09:36:10] <Jayflux> but they do the same thing
[09:36:15] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: only the dom
[09:36:20] <Mkop> datlap: val=$("#ajax_table_result").find('div.latvis').text();
[09:36:25] <Whirl3d> that rocks. Thanks ajpiano
[09:36:44] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: but remove might clobber its events anyway, you should use .detach() instead of remove
[09:37:03] <ajpiano> not that there necessarily are events or data on the image at that point, but whatevs
[09:37:07] <Whirl3d> will do, thanks for the advice.
[09:37:47] <fuso> salute
[09:38:03] <fuso> !lista
[09:38:47] <fuso> *list
[09:43:59] <dogarrhea2> so. i created http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7913 .  Any ideas on how to work around the draggable/scrolling/containment bug?
[09:45:19] <datlap> Mkop: i found that if i include  val=$('div.latvis').text(); inside  $.get(url, function(results){} then it works. otherwise it displays the old value.
[09:46:38] <krogant> is the jquery color plugin included with ui?
[09:47:07] <skamikaze> krogant: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137750/ColorPicker
[09:47:31] <krogant> samstefan: i want to animate bg color
[09:47:52] <skamikaze> (was a quick google hit though)
[09:48:16] <zulax> this line is killing my code :( 		      ui.draggable("disable");
[09:48:39] <ajpiano> krogant: yes it is
[09:49:04] <krogant> ajpiano: thanks. so now i know it should be working ;)
[09:51:03] <samstefan> krogant: what do you mean?
[09:54:34] <BMCouto> Hi, I need to set to keydown events to a page, one to a slider that i've done, and another to a slider inside a modal with jquery uiâ€¦ problem isâ€¦ when im inside the modal using the keydown event, i can see behing the slider moving tooâ€¦ so how can i "separate" those events?
[09:59:49] <krogant> samstefan: imagine animating a css background color from color a to color b. that's what the color plugin does
[09:59:59] <krogant> animate usu. only animates numerical properties
[10:00:59] <dogarrhea2> ok screw jquery draggable i'm writing my own
[10:05:57] <datlap> i have a <div class="lat">value</div> sitting in a for loop. when i do console.log($('div.lat').text()) it prints out a bunch of value. how do i get the index of each value?
[10:15:27] <Foxandxss> I have an anchor that does an ajax and replace a div to another one, some objects inside the replace div doesn't respond to clicks (javascript) but other elements works
[10:15:32] <Foxandxss> both have .live events
[10:16:21] <z1000> Foxandxss, URL ?
[10:16:35] <Foxandxss> oh, sec
[10:16:59] <dogarrhea2> any way to translate offsets to local coordinates? (of the parent)
[10:17:49] <Foxandxss> (another bug on the way....)

[10:27:26] <Foxandxss> z1000, I think I know. And you wont see anything lookint at the web code
[10:28:19] <Foxandxss> I render a template (django) to a string and pass it back via json and replace it, the template doesn't contain the wrapper, its inherited
[10:28:22] <Foxandxss> maybe the problem is there
[10:28:53] <Foxandxss> i moved the wrapper to the concrete page and worked
[10:29:04] <Foxandxss> but I Can't do that
[10:30:25] <Foxandxss> or not, the string I return is the complete page, weird
[10:31:41] <z1000> one moment on phone
[10:32:04] <Foxandxss> sure
[10:39:15] <z1000> ok back Foxandxss
[10:39:32] <Foxandxss> $("#wrapper").replaceWith($(response.html).filter("div#wrapper"));
[10:39:33] <z1000> I wanna help you because I have had similar issue so trying to understand the specific issue
[10:40:02] <Foxandxss> with that i replace the entire wrapper
[10:40:06] <Foxandxss> but is curious
[10:40:15] <Foxandxss> $('#header').replaceWith($(response.html).filter("div#header"));
[10:40:17] <Foxandxss> this doesn't work
[10:40:26] <Foxandxss> it just replace the #header with nothing
[10:41:13] <z1000> hmm
[10:41:31] <Chopps> hey guys, so i have a value in a cookie (a number), what can i do add another number to that number saved on the cookie?
[10:41:52] <Foxandxss> I thought I can replace just specific parts (what changes) instead of the entire wrapper
[10:44:16] <datlap> i have lat=$('div.latvis').text(); lon=$('div.lonvis').text(); is there a way to loop through both at the same time? i need to pair lat and lon together
[10:44:48] <Chopps> nvm just found out about parseInt()
[10:54:20] <wookiehangover> Chopps: make sure you pass the second argument to that
[10:54:24] <wookiehangover> ?mdc parseInt
[10:54:25] <bot-t> wookiehangover, parseInt - MDN - Parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix or base. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt
[10:54:47] <wookiehangover> ?eval parseInt("9001", 2)
[10:54:48] <bot-t> wookiehangover: NaN
[10:55:51] <wookiehangover> ?eval parseInt("9001", 12)
[10:55:51] <bot-t> wookiehangover: 15553
[10:56:19] <Chopps> im not using the 2nd argument and it is returning decimal, so i guess its the default base
[10:56:44] <wookiehangover> ya, but its best practice to always pass 10 as the second arg
[10:57:03] <Chopps> ah kk, noted and corrected :P
[10:57:08] <wookiehangover> just for your own edification :)
[10:57:22] <rethus> passwort strength-checker and check for same string on password repeat: http://jsfiddle.net/KK237/8/

[11:20:01] <Foxandxss> how to make a filter to an inner object? I have a collection and with filter I can filter to an inmediate child
[11:20:12] <Foxandxss> how to filter to a child of a child?
[11:22:55] <Foxandxss> ok, im debugging
[11:23:43] <glauco29> hi
[11:23:49] <glauco29> I have a div
[11:23:55] <glauco29> I clone it using .clone()
[11:24:06] <glauco29> but jQuery clone the content of div
[11:24:16] <glauco29> but the div same not
[11:27:15] <WebDragon> ok here's a tricky one for you
[11:28:08] <WebDragon> due to the whacky way in which the top navbar of this site gets built' there's no automated way to mark the current link in the nav as the active one (plus there's two levels top and subnav that need individual active marks on the li's)
[11:28:21] <WebDragon> so the top part I find with var navbartop = $(".header-container .nav > li a");
[11:28:53] <WebDragon> now (there's four top-level nav items) for one of them I search for a particular body tag $(".cms-company")
[11:29:24] <WebDragon> and then from there I need to find the href of navbar that matches a particular criterion so I can mark the parent-li as current
[11:30:04] <WebDragon> it's ass-backwards from how you'd normally have to do it and far less elegant, since I need to match individually on one of .cms-home .cms-shop .cms-company and .contacts-index-index to mark one of the four top-level nav items as active
[11:30:09] <Guest27286> the most elegant way of remove id from a clone() input ?
[11:30:15] <WebDragon> (those classes are on the body tag btw)
[11:30:18] <bartmax> the most elegant way of remove id from a clone() input ?
[11:31:07] <WebDragon> how do I do this matching on the individual hrefs of the found items a:link so that I can set the parent li as current?
[11:36:17] <bartmax> anyone here ?
[11:36:24] <imsky> i'm so here
[11:36:40] <barfoo365> I have a jquery animation that loops, when it returns to start the loop again i reset the CSS with removeattr.  It works fine in Firefox, but not in chrome, safari or ie.  Anyone give me any pointers?
[11:36:44] <bartmax> imsky: elegant way to remove name & id from an input ?
[11:36:48] <bartmax> cloned one that is
[11:37:06] <imsky> remove name & id?
[11:37:14] <bartmax> yes
[11:37:34] <imsky> if i'm asking, it's not because i didn't hear you. it's because you need to explain
[11:38:04] <bartmax> lol! hahahha you made me laugh heh sorry...
[11:38:05] <bartmax> var $realinput = $input.clone();
[11:38:05] <bartmax>         $input.after($realinput);
[11:38:05] <bartmax>         $input.removeAttr('name').removeAttr('id');
[11:38:23] <imsky> that's about as elegant as you'll get
[11:38:29] <bartmax> :(
[11:38:29] <imsky> less typing is .removeAttr('name id')
[11:38:48] <bartmax> didn't work
[11:38:58] <imsky> are you on 1.7
[11:39:01] <bartmax> nope
[11:39:06] <imsky> that's why
[11:39:07] <bartmax> 1.6.2
[11:39:32] <bartmax> maybe i upgrade :D
[11:40:18] <jab416171|Cloud> why doesn't this work? https://gist.github.com/1394207 the code in the click doesn't execute
[11:41:12] <bartmax> imsky: change type to hidden ?
[11:41:30] <bartmax> attr('type', 'hidden') doesn't seem to work
[11:42:51] <imsky> why would you need to do that
[11:43:22] <nail_> jab416171|Cloud: you can't chain methods with .live
[11:43:56] <jab416171|Cloud> nail_: I don't know what you mean
[11:44:20] <nail_> like $(foo).eq(bar).live()
[11:44:40] <imsky> $("foo:eq("+bar+")").live() works though
[11:44:40] <jab416171|Cloud> what about $($(foo).eq(bar)).live()
[11:45:02] <imsky> although now with .on, the consequences will never be the same
[11:45:44] <jab416171|Cloud> I don't have to use live, I just need an onclick
[11:45:57] <jab416171|Cloud> if something is better or preferred, please say so
[11:46:07] <Jon47> jabetc..
[11:46:11] <Jon47> .on is the preferred method moving forward
[11:46:48] <Jon47> .live is powerful but it doesn't encourage best practices, so they created a new API that encompasses the old uses for .bind, .delegate, and .live in a single method
[11:47:11] <jab416171|Cloud> so, just replace live with on?
[11:47:13] <Jon47> it'll make your delegations more purposeful and help you to understand what's actually happening on the DOM
[11:47:33] <Jon47> read this http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:47:49] <jab416171|Cloud> I am
[11:48:18] <bartmax> 	imsky, ok this is the deal.
[11:48:28] <bartmax> I have an input that do calculation based on user input
[11:48:29] <jabarkas> anyone here able to help me with some plugin chaining?
[11:48:50] <bartmax> when the page load, it clones the input because that isn't what i want to submit after the user do some changes.
[11:49:04] <bartmax> but the value is ok if no js is available
[11:49:18] <bartmax> so im printing the page as if no js with the input and it's name/value
[11:49:33] <jab416171|Cloud> what version of jQuery was on added?
[11:49:35] <bartmax> but if js is enabled, user can do some 'crazy things' and I need another 'hidden' input to use instead
[11:49:40] <jab416171|Cloud> 1.7?
[11:49:50] <bartmax> simple example:
[11:49:53] <bartmax> product price = 100
[11:49:53] <Jon47> yeah, 1.7
[11:50:03] <jab416171|Cloud> I'm using 1.6, I should update
[11:50:06] <bartmax> input type="text" name="price" value="100"
[11:50:10] <bartmax> after ready
[11:50:22] <Jon47> yeah definitely, 1.7 adds new APIs and cuts event handling time in half
[11:50:23] <bartmax> there's acheckbox that sais price include vat?
[11:50:36] <bartmax> if user set to true, the input box remains the same (usability) and it still says 100
[11:50:43] <imsky> bartmax: that shouldn't be done on clientside
[11:50:45] <bartmax> but the real value i want to submit is the price without the vat.
[11:51:06] <bartmax> imsky: what should be done in clientside?
[11:51:14] <NoiseEee> bartmax: you don't want to be taking anything about "price" from clientside.
[11:51:31] <NoiseEee> bartmax: all you care abotu is the checkbox "includes VAT" and you then apply that to the price coming out of your DATABASE
[11:51:33] <imsky> bartmax: nothing. just submit the form and move this logic to the backend
[11:51:41] <bartmax> it's a ecommerce ADM
[11:51:51] <bartmax> how is that user cannot set the product price? sheess
[11:52:50] <bartmax> actually, it's a lot more complex, because it take costs and stock and stuff on the panel. It's a product manager...
[11:52:54] <bartmax> of course i need user to manage price.
[11:52:59] <bartmax> that's all about it
[11:53:18] <jab416171|Cloud> what's the preferred href of an a tag that purely executes javascript
[11:53:34] <NoiseEee> jab416171|Cloud: something other than an <a> element ;)
[11:53:39] <soc42> hi #jquery
[11:53:47] <bartmax> jab416171|Cloud: dont use <a>
[11:53:47] <NoiseEee> jab416171|Cloud: or, if you must, # and stop the event.
[11:54:08] <soc42> anyone using qunit for jquery development?
[11:54:16] <bartmax> jab416171|Cloud: or set a url that works like the javascript if no js involved. and preventDefault event
[11:55:28] <bartmax> Ok ... how can I change a cloned input from text to hidden. ?
[11:55:45] <imsky> you can't with jquery
[11:55:54] <imsky> they disable it because of IE
[11:55:58] <NoiseEee> bartmax: by changing the "type" attribute???
[11:56:03] <bartmax> NoiseEee: doesn't work
[11:56:24] <bartmax> mmm...
[11:57:06] <bartmax> .hide() then
[11:57:16] <NoiseEee> bartmax: i'm worried you're taking your price information and making it 'hidden' thinking that nobody will mess with it?
[11:57:36] <bartmax> NoiseEee: they can mess with it!
[11:57:41] <Taar779> Does event.preventDefault() work with .submit()? I can't seem to get the submit button not to submit the form ...
[11:57:51] <bartmax> NoiseEee: i just making their life easier. The whole point is them to mess with the price.
[11:57:59] <NoiseEee> bartmax: okay
[11:58:01] <jab416171|Cloud> why is the jquery source on 3 lines, and not just one?
[11:58:02] <Jon47> Taar779 you might want to try "return false;" in that case
[11:58:13] <bartmax> NoiseEee: imagine doing a EditProductPrice admin page.
[11:58:31] <Jon47> i think it's to make the comments more readable
[11:58:46] <bartmax> NoiseEee: if they can reach there, they can set the price they want. After all it's their product.
[11:59:06] <NoiseEee> bartmax: gotcha
[11:59:46] <Jon47> actually that doesn't make much sense.., i'm not sure why it's on three lines
[12:00:33] <glauco29> hi
[12:01:04] <glauco29> I want apply a mask plugin for all inputs that has .date class on document ready
[12:01:24] <glauco29> I am trying: $(document).delegate('.date', 'load', function(){
[12:01:58] <glauco29> which event type must I use to fire it?
[12:02:35] <Jon47> glauco29, i am not sure that each element fires the "load" event..
[12:02:47] <jabarkas> having trouble with a chainable plugin. It's very simple code. Anybody able to take a look? http://jsfiddle.net/jXjT7/22/
[12:03:46] <glauco29> They dont fire
[12:04:00] <glauco29> I dont know which event type I must use
[12:04:07] <Jon47> glauco29 what are you trying to do?
[12:04:16] <glauco29> I have a date field
[12:04:17] <Jon47> just run a plugin on some elements the document loads?
[12:04:31] <glauco29> I can add others date field clicking in plus button
[12:04:47] <glauco29> I need fire all fields with date plugin
[12:05:14] <jabarkas> $(document).ready(function() {   myFunction($('.date'));   }
[12:05:14] <Jon47> what's wrong with this: $(document).ready(function(){ $('.date').something() });
[12:05:16] <r1ppa> jQuery not happy about this line, why? description = document.referrer + " :: " + description;
[12:05:44] <r1ppa> claiming var description as undefined
[12:05:49] <glauco29> this dont work
[12:05:58] <glauco29> because I add others date field later
[12:06:09] <glauco29> I dont want to fire each once again
[12:06:40] <Jon47> glauco29: everytime you add new content, just run the date plugin on the content you added, not on the whole document
[12:06:41] <jabarkas> add them with 2 classes,   'date' and 'newDate'
[12:06:45] <jabarkas> yea
[12:06:49] <glauco29> Must exist a way to fire all (inclusive that were created after page load)
[12:07:14] <glauco29> I dont want to do it Jon47
[12:07:20] <jab416171|Cloud> is there an alternative to this? $($('.next').eq(index))
[12:07:26] <glauco29> It seems a bad way
[12:07:36] <Jon47> glauco, "load" is not an event for elements, it only works for external resources, such as images or js/css files
[12:07:56] <Jon47> you can't fire something on "load" for elements matching your selector, it may seem bad to you but that's just not how it works
[12:07:57] <glauco29> I know that load dont work to do it
[12:08:38] <jabarkas> can somebody take a look at my plugin? http://jsfiddle.net/jXjT7/22/   i am trying to make it chainable, after a number of .load() events have completed
[12:08:43] <glauco29> it is friday
[12:09:09] <glauco29> Monday I return
[12:09:14] <glauco29> hugs
[12:09:16] <glauco29> thank u
[12:10:06] <jabarkas> http://jsfiddle.net/jXjT7/24/  updated that fiddle
[12:11:45] <WebDragon> gads even THINKING about this is horribly inefficient
[12:16:58] <WebDragon> ok how do I define var $navbartop = $(".header-container .nav > li"); and then use it within a jquery expression correctly -- for example what I WANT to do is $(".cms-company" $navbartop).find("a[href=/foo]") more or less
[12:17:44] <WebDragon> what's the right way to define a class superseding a jquery object for the purpose of selecting that object only if the wrapping class is present
[12:18:31] <WebDragon> there has to be a way to do this right
[12:21:59] <WebDragon> anyone?
[12:24:05] <garann> WebDragon: can you just add the parent class to your first selector?
[12:24:57] <Taar779> Does .live() work with submit?
[12:25:24] <garann> live() is deprecated, Taar779
[12:26:00] <WebDragon> garann: no unfortunately. the thing that's generating this navbar is A> very messy, B> not easily individually classed, and C> there's no definite rhyme-and-reason behind the body classes that I have to use to find them with
[12:26:08] <WebDragon> live() was deprecated?
[12:26:17] <WebDragon> did it get replaced with anything?
[12:26:33] <Taar779> garann, if live() is deprecated what do we use in its place?
[12:26:39] <garann> WebDragon: ah.. you could get the parent and use hasClass()?
[12:26:55] <garann> yeah, live() is deprecated in the latest release - you can use on() instead
[12:27:07] <garann> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:29:40] <NoiseEee> i'm just picking up jquery... why do I sometimes see  "var $dog"  versus "var dog"
[12:29:57] <WebDragon> garann: the body has the following possible classes in the top-level nav: .cms-shop .cms-portfolio .cms-company .contacts-index-index. when in the site's sections that contain shop or portfolio those classes will not be present. then you're stuck with .catalog-product-view and then for the subnav under shop I need to ALSO make the subnav category show active based on the body.category-<catname>
[12:30:36] <WebDragon> if I could easily add individual classes to each nav item that's autogenerated as well as those specified in the cms-static-blocks that its built from ,I'd be in heaven
[12:30:36] <kanzie> how can I animate the opacity of my background-image?
[12:30:47] <WebDragon> unfortunately it's amazingly problematic
[12:31:23] <WebDragon> the insides of this thing is a stultifyingly complex MVC implementation that builds stuff from all over the place
[12:32:07] <Haraldson> kanzie: You have to put the background-image in an element of its own, and animate that
[12:32:18] <kanzie> Haraldson: hmmm
[12:32:25] <kanzie> Haraldson: ok, thanks
[12:32:53] <garann> WebDragon: you lost me - not 100% sure what you're attempting
[12:32:54] <Haraldson> kanzie: no problem. just position it behind your other stuff
[12:33:30] <WebDragon> garann: you think YOUR head hurts .. you should see mine, after studying this damn thing trying to find a workaround
[12:33:56] <kanzie> Haraldson: but do I have to use absolute positioning on it then? if I lower the opacity of the element all its children would turn invisible too, right?
[12:34:37] <Haraldson> kanzie: yes, opacity is for the element itself, so all properties and contents would fade out
[12:34:56] <kanzie> hmm, yeah I dont know if I can use absolute on all elements
[12:35:34] <Haraldson> if you control the HTML yourself, it's no biggie setting position: relative; on the parent, and position:absolute; top: 0; left: 0; on the background element
[12:35:57] <Haraldson> then just make sure you wrap your content in an element with relative position, so that it stacks on top
[12:37:27] <Haraldson> WebDragon: Sounds like you need to sit down and write down a list of conditions for each different menu to show or not
[12:37:31] <Haraldson> to get on top of things
[12:38:32] <WebDragon> Haraldson: there's one other possibility
[12:38:57] <WebDragon> I go in and manually find each instance that builds a section of the nav and hand-add classes somehow so that I can uniquely indentify them and then select like so
[12:39:08] <WebDragon> $jQ(".cms-shop .header-container li.shop-nav-index, .catalog-category-view .header-container li.shop-nav-index, .catalog-product-view .header-container li.shop-nav-index").addClass("current_section");
[12:39:20] <WebDragon> or $jQ(".contacts-index-index .header-container li.contacts-nav-index").addClass("current_section");
[12:39:29] <WebDragon> and then just make a string of those
[12:39:51] <WebDragon> I can't think of an easier way to manipulate the double-helix matrix of the nav sections
[12:39:58] <Haraldson> I bet you could write it like $('parentselector').find('child1, child2, child3')
[12:40:09] <WebDragon> if the site wasn't under a maintenance.flag so I'd have to whitelist your IP I could show you
[12:40:43] <WebDragon> Haraldson: no because there's 8 different possibilities for parent selector that need to individually match one and possibly two nav menu items to make it (or them both) active
[12:40:54] <WebDragon> non-trivial problem
[12:40:57] <Haraldson> question is, if you have access to change those classes, why do you need to do this rather complex thing in JS and not in your backend?
[12:41:14] <Haraldson> I know, the selector was just so painfully long
[12:41:18] <WebDragon> hacking the backend was something I'd been trying to avoid because it's monstrously head-pain-inducing
[12:41:33] <Haraldson> seems hacking it with JS is no different :D
[12:41:41] <WebDragon> the above two lines WERE the result of hacking one of the cms-static-blocks
[12:41:48] <WebDragon> =)
[12:41:56] <WebDragon> which DID make the top-nav part easier
[12:42:08] <WebDragon> it's the subnav for portfolio and shop that are really going to kill me
[12:42:34] <Haraldson> doesn't sound like fun...
[12:42:42] <WebDragon> since shop's subnav is generated by magento, and portolio's nav (while not) the parent classes are generated by wordpress not magento
[12:42:50] <Haraldson> althoughâ€¦ you probably have some unique elements in your DOM on those pages / sections?
[12:43:06] <Haraldson> like shop products, showcases or whatnot that you can check if exists or not?
[12:43:26] <WebDragon> yeah that's the problem. there's TOO MANY unique classes for body with no "####-thing" or "thing-####" that's easily matched on
[12:43:35] <Haraldson> I was thinking of content
[12:43:38] <Haraldson> hooks in templates
[12:43:56] <WebDragon> oh believe me, this thing's innards make wordpress templating look like a chewing gum wrapper
[12:44:02] <WebDragon> ever worked with magento ?
[12:44:04] <Haraldson> like if there's a cart somewhere in the framework in the shop section, check if that exists
[12:44:32] <WebDragon> this job would be so much easier with out a client to make unreasonable demands on how things should work in their never even remotely humble opinion
[12:44:32] <Haraldson> nope
[12:44:41] <Haraldson> I realize I'm lucky that I don't have to
[12:44:41] <WebDragon> ;D
[12:44:50] <WebDragon> yeah you just don't know HOW lucky
[12:45:12] <WebDragon> anyway, I've determined that the shortest path will have to be hacking the files that build parts of this, so off I go
[12:45:24] <Haraldson> good luck to you
[12:45:35] * WebDragon waves 
[12:47:24] <hdon_> hi all :) i'm going to write this myself unless someone tells me it's already out there for the using :)
[12:48:10] <Haraldson> hdon_: what?
[12:49:03] <hdon_> i have a vertically scrolling div that is adding new items in at the top. when i do this, obviously, it pushes the rest of the content downward. unless the scrollbar position is at the topmost position, i want the div to scroll to accommodate the extra vertical height of its content. the effect being that, the content that is visible does not change (whereas right now, it gets pushed down)
[12:49:22] <hdon_> i'm sure it's not very hard to do, but if it already exists i'd like to use it :)
[12:49:47] <Haraldson> haven't heard of a specific plugin handling this
[12:49:52] <Haraldson> but it should be easy enough to write
[12:50:43] <Haraldson> you just need to know the height of the content you add, the current scrollposition in the div, and add those together and set a new scroll position
[12:53:55] <WebDragon> can jquery take an array of selectors as a selector ? for example $( array ).attr("href", null); or whatever ?
[12:53:56] <NoiseEee> i'm just picking up jquery... why do I sometimes see  "var $dog"  versus "var dog"
[12:54:32] <ajpiano> NoiseEee:  see ?$prefix
[12:54:32] <bot-t> NoiseEee, It is a common convention to prefix variables that refer to jQuery objects with a $ (Ex. var $this = $(this). The $ has NO SPECIAL MEANING and is simply customary among some developers. Others object to it on the grounds that it is "Hungarian Notation." Feel free to use it or not!
[12:54:55] <NoiseEee> thanks ajpiano
[12:56:32] <datlap> i need to pass a table's cell val to my jquery script. i don't need to display it.                                 <td> <div class="latvis" style="display: none">value</div></td> kinda works since it doesn't display the value, however it still takes up some space in the table. what to do?
[12:57:05] <ajpiano> you need to stop referring to the text content of an element as its value, first of all
[12:57:11] <ajpiano> because it's really ambiguous
[12:57:29] <ajpiano> and you shouldn't be storing it as text inside of the element if it's not meant for display
[12:57:40] <ajpiano> you should be storing it as a data attribute on the tr or something along those lines
[13:01:55] <WebDragon> instead of doing $(".thing1, .thing2, ad infinitum").foo(); is it possible to pass it an array such as $( array ).foo();
[13:02:15] <ajpiano> an array of what?
[13:02:22] <jrockjiggz> array.each()
[13:02:22] <WebDragon> I have a series of very long selectors of necessity because the nav-builder happens three times separately on some pages and is used differently each time
[13:02:38] <black_warlock> hi
[13:02:39] <MoTiOnXml> is $('element').length == 0; the best approach for checking if the selector found anything?
[13:02:53] <jrockjiggz> MoTiOnXml: yep
[13:02:53] <ajpiano> WebDragon: $( array.join() )
[13:02:58] <MoTiOnXml> jrockjiggz: thanks
[13:03:01] <WebDragon> ajpiano: http://fpaste.org/GgOh/
[13:03:04] <WebDragon> something like this
[13:03:09] <black_warlock> who knows how to get videos youtube infos via json ?
[13:03:10] <WebDragon> array.join() would work? ok
[13:03:21] <WebDragon> thanks (making notes)
[13:03:43] <ajpiano> yes
[13:05:23] <WebDragon> beautiful
[13:05:43] <WebDragon> now this long-list of matches (that's going to be longer, ultimately) can be humanly readable
[13:08:12] <poincare101> My first jquery plugin: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Delectable What do you think?
[13:09:43] <ajpiano> poincare101: what is the point of this
[13:10:08] <ajpiano> it also doesn't return a jquery collection so it isn't chainable
[13:10:45] <ajpiano> poincare101: typically you want to like, have a demo and describe what the point of a plugin is
[13:12:27] <okj579> Also, doesn't work for me. I get a TypeError because select doesn't exist on all elementns
[13:12:29] <dabear> heh, that's a lot of code :p
[13:12:40] <dabear> or not
[13:13:28] <dabear> poincare101: you should not do this inside a plugin: $(this).click
[13:13:49] <datlap> ajpiano:your advice makes sense however the space is still there  <td> <div class="latvis"  data-lat="{{ lat }}"></div></td>
[13:13:57] <dabear> poincare101: "this" inside a plugin is always a jquery object. so you can do this.click instead
[13:14:45] <ajpiano> datlap: wtf
[13:14:58] <ajpiano> i said store it in a data attr on the TR
[13:15:01] <ajpiano> not the td itself
[13:15:08] <ajpiano> there shouldn't BE a TD if there is nothing to display
[13:16:37] <datlap> I'm confused. i have 3 tis lat,lon and url. how can i store all 3 on the tr?
[13:17:22] <ajpiano> a data attribute for each one?
[13:17:24] <k1ng> someone please help me with jquery ui
[13:17:26] <k1ng> dialog
[13:17:32] <k1ng> http://jsfiddle.net/JABg7/
[13:17:49] <k1ng> buttons functions doesnt work
[13:17:50] <dw> hiding bits of data in the dom is evil
[13:17:54] <NoiseEee> datlap: <tr data-url='www.whatever.com' data-lat='109' data-long='1440' id='item_1442'>
[13:18:29] <ajpiano> dw: according to who?
[13:19:23] <dw> according to experience since the dawn of the industry, mashing presentation and data model together is just wrong
[13:19:31] <Eviltwin> k1ng: You need to include jQuery UI
[13:19:36] <datlap> how do u loop through different rows then. before i had  for(var i = 0; i < $("div.lonvis").length; i++) {lat=parseFloat($("div.latvis").eq(i).data("lat"));
[13:19:36] <NoiseEee> dw: html5 specifically has data- attributes.
[13:19:36] <dw> convenient, and wrong
[13:19:50] <k1ng> Eviltwin, jsfiddle doesnt have jqueryui
[13:20:05] <Eviltwin> k1ng: Right, you need to add it under "Add Resources"
[13:20:39] <ajpiano> dw: html5 is wrong, or what?
[13:21:01] <k1ng> Eviltwin, i didnt know :D
[13:21:16] <k1ng> well $(this).dialog("close"); doesnt work
[13:21:21] <ajpiano> dw: how do you bootstrap arbitraray data into the dom that needs to be used by javascript "models?"
[13:21:48] <dw> ajpiano: html5 provides a standardized approach to commiting wrong, does not somehow make it right. it was designed to unify reliance on implementation details, which promotes compatibility. that is far from a blanket blessing
[13:21:53] <snover> ajpiano: I think the point is that you donâ€™t, because the DOM isnâ€™t a data store, and you should only store references to DOM elements from JS, not the other way around
[13:22:01] <okj579> ajpiano,dw: It depends on what relationship the data has with the DOM element
[13:22:10] <dw> prior to data-, some browsers honoured unknown attributes, others discarde
[13:22:23] <okj579> If it's directly related to the element, data is perfect, if not it is indeed evil
[13:22:30] <Eviltwin> I don't see what's wrong with using data- attributes to communicate state
[13:22:31] <snover> dw: no browsers discard unknown attributes
[13:22:35] <dw> dom is a presentation model. try having your web designer re lay out some elements that have data stashed in them
[13:22:35] <ajpiano> which browsers discarded ..
[13:22:48] <okj579> dw: Not since at least IE5
[13:23:05] <snover> dw: there are still entirely presentational uses for data- attributes
[13:23:14] <okj579> They don't use undefined attributes, but they still exist
[13:23:18] <snover> for example, dojo uses them to indicate which elements should be used as attach points for bound data, etc.
[13:23:44] <dw> snover: that seems sane
[13:24:06] <ajpiano> so in an ideal world, how do you guys solve datlap's problem
[13:24:41] <dw> perhaps with a JS level object that holds a reference to the relevant view object(s), and whatever data he's storing
[13:24:42] <ajpiano> he needs to know the lat/long for each tr, without presenting it at all
[13:24:54] <dw> ideally with just the data in an object by itself, and a separate object for managing that binding to a view
[13:25:13] <ajpiano> that presumes so much about the malleability and structure of his existing application
[13:25:26] <Eviltwin> dw: Storing that data in JS means you're assuming JS is going to be interacting with it
[13:25:38] <Eviltwin> Storing it in data- tags means something might want it
[13:25:42] <dw> data- is also strings-only, and jquery has magic to try to convert it. .data() is therefore a broken interfacel ikely to introduce bugs solely based on random user input
[13:25:43] <Eviltwin> Or it could just be ignored entirely
[13:25:51] <snover> Eviltwin: hm?
[13:25:58] <ajpiano> dw: so grab it via attr
[13:26:01] <minna> Do jquery animate fallback on CSS3 animation??
[13:26:07] <ajpiano> minna: no
[13:26:11] <Eviltwin> minna: No
[13:26:16] <minna> :-(
[13:26:16] <snover> dw: trust me, I beat that dead horse a long time ago
[13:26:27] <minna> Why not?!
[13:26:40] <Eviltwin> minna: Because that would be a whole new nightmare
[13:26:44] <ajpiano> because sad faces don't make hard features magically exist, minna
[13:26:51] <dw> sorry. i just find it frustrating watchingthe propagation of poorly structured crap that happens in this channels with regularity
[13:27:10] <minna> ajpiano: But this plugin does it? http://playground.benbarnett.net/jquery-animate-enhanced/
[13:27:17] <Eviltwin> dw: Then don't be in this channel?
[13:27:25] <dw> Eviltwin: i still use jQuery
[13:27:30] <ajpiano> step up to the plate if you have qualms
[13:27:33] <Eviltwin> dw: So do a lot of people who aren't here
[13:27:41] <Eviltwin> minna: If the plugin works for you, use it
[13:27:55] <dw> Eviltwin: your suggestion seems to be "if you have problems with bad advice in here, then leave"
[13:28:01] <minna> Ok.
[13:28:25] <minna> Bad advice is to be expected in a chat man.
[13:28:28] <minna> Just accept it
[13:28:40] <snover> minna: Such high standards!
[13:28:49] <minna> :-D
[13:28:51] <khmer> $('.people').chill();
[13:28:56] <minna> Don't take it the wrong way.
[13:29:06] <ajpiano> dw, data attrs is a completely reasonable halfway point to avoiding burying stuff in the dom when it needs to be accessed in the DOM
[13:29:08] <minna> I just mean, he's not paying anyone for a job.
[13:29:43] <khmer> i often go into the grocery store and rail at a floor manager for the bruises on the peppers
[13:29:46] <ajpiano> if you are inclined to walk the gentleman through everything necessary for him to understand how he'd go about building an application that has the data in objects and then bound to views, please, by my guest
[13:29:53] <khmer> but somehow the lumpenproletariat is making their gumbo anyway
[13:30:02] <k1ng> Eviltwin, i just found out return false; doesnt work on dialog's buttons
[13:30:55] <minna> It doesn't? Good to know.
[13:32:29] <khmer> k1ng: what are you expecting return false to do?
[13:33:19] <k1ng> um i am going to use if(dialog == true) { do something }
[13:33:52] <khmer> k1ng: why not just do something in the handler itself?
[13:34:19] <Eviltwin> Don't the button listeners have to tell the dialog to close?
[13:34:28] <k1ng> its does now
[13:34:46] <Eviltwin> I didn't realize there was any other way
[13:37:37] <k1ng> http://jsfiddle.net/9B4tD/
[13:39:04] <lostinplace> is this the right place to ask jqueryui questions?
[13:39:14] <khmer> lostinplace: sure
[13:39:40] <khmer> k1ng: you're returning from the dialog handler, now from the outer function
[13:39:41] <lostinplace> I'm trying to apply a css3 transition + boxshadow to a jqueryui dialog
[13:39:51] <lostinplace> but chrome just refuses to implement it
[13:39:55] <lostinplace> kind of wondering why
[13:40:29] <k1ng> khmer, yea
[13:40:48] <khmer> k1ng: that's why it's not working
[13:40:57] <k1ng> how do i make it work?
[13:41:06] <khmer> k1ng: do you understand what returning from a function does
[13:41:25] <k1ng> yes
[13:41:57] <khmer> when you said "returning false doesn't work in dialog", what are you expecting to happen
[13:42:20] <NoiseEee> also, what is "dialog"?
[13:42:29] <khmer> it's a jquery ui plugin
[13:43:22] <lostinplace> yup
[13:46:45] <khmer> k1ng: so you're not answering?
[13:46:58] <k1ng> well i thought it would
[13:47:54] <datlap> so what am i supposed to do now. all i want is to loop through the rows and grab a few lat and lon and display them in a map..
[13:48:49] <ajpiano> try doing that.
[13:49:19] <AlainJacomet> I'm having a problem with a ComboBox.. Strangely, I'm getting http://www.site.com/?combobox1=value1&combobox1=value2&combobox1=value3, whereas the string should be ?combobox1=value1+value2+value3. Can I fix this with jQuery Â¿?
[13:49:24] <Whirl3d> If I a attach an image to the body element of the dom and I want to know if it is touching another image, is there any fancy way to do that or do I just have to parse dimensions and compare?
[13:49:35] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: the latter :/
[13:50:18] <saschagehlich> hey, can i do something like $(jqueryobject1, jqueryobject2) like i'd do with $('#obj1, #obj2') ?
[13:50:23] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, thanks. drats! Maybe I'll just have one image visible at a time...then I don't have to worry about overlap.
[13:50:35] <khmer> k1ng: the function finishes executing when the dialog appears. it's not like a confirm box.
[13:50:52] <k1ng> hm
[13:50:54] <khmer> k1ng: so you can't return the user's response--you need to treat the user's response like an event, instead of writing it procedurally
[14:01:10] <Eviltwin> saschagehlich: jqueryobject1.add(jqueryobject2)
[14:01:24] <Eviltwin> saschagehlich: That adds all of the elements of the second to the first
[14:01:43] <saschagehlich> Eviltwin: what I meant is listening to events of two jquery objects at the same time
[14:02:10] <Eviltwin> What do you do is create a collection containing the contents of both of the objects and listen on that
[14:02:21] <saschagehlich> oh okay
[14:02:29] <saschagehlich> thank you
[14:02:44] <Eviltwin> I forget if it's considered bad form but you can do $().add(obj1).add(obj2)
[14:02:51] <Eviltwin> If you don't want to alter the original objects
[14:03:26] <khmer> an even better answer is to delegate to their first common parent
[14:03:32] <khmer> and listen for bubbling events who match either one
[14:03:51] <Eviltwin> I figured he didn't necessarily know the parents or selectors of either of them
[14:03:56] <Eviltwin> But maybe he does
[14:07:19] <black_warlock> guys who can help me with a jq function to extract vids title ?
[14:07:41] <lostinplace> does jquery ui block css3 transitions?
[14:11:03] <Guest70665> ciao
[14:12:08] <Jon47> lostinplace i seriously doubt that it does
[14:14:21] <aglemann> question.. i need to put data into the HTML for JS to use... i was originally doing it with HTML5 data-* attributes, but i can't seem to find a reason why serializing JSON into attributes of HTML tags is better than just using <script> tags to put the JSON in some namespace in the global scope - thoughts?
[14:14:29] <lostinplace> I'm trying to add a linear transition box shadow to a jquery uii dialog and the entire page is refusing to accept the transition property
[14:15:39] <amirite> give up
[14:17:00] <NoiseEee> aglemann: it's really up to you.  if the data you're after really is related to a specific element, maybe data- attributes are the way to go. if you want to have the data available to all elements/functions/etc, then you might as well throw an object in <script></script>
[14:19:20] <Jon47> NoiseEee +1, aglemann, if the information is associated to the DOM element, i think it makes sense to have it in the data-attribs, but there's no rule about how to do it, just go with what seems best to you
[14:20:14] <richardr> I'm putting together a jQuery plugin that uses prototypical inheritance Javascript design pattern. One of these methods, does a getJSON call but is cross-domain so requires jsonp and the callback param. By default, it passes through a name/key of '_' which is not accepted by the API I'm calling. How do I refer to a function within my prototype here?
[14:22:06] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: you skooled me in that last game man
[14:28:21] <[mgw]> skoooooooooool
[14:31:31] <richardr> Anyone?
[14:31:57] <datlap> NoiseEee: i can't find document anywhere on how to retrieve the data.  i have firstrow=$("table:first").find("tr:first"); and need to get the lat value from data-lat
[14:34:05] <NoiseEee> datlap: hint... it's an attribute
[14:34:06] <NoiseEee> later folks.
[14:37:36] <richardr> I think it's a scope issue. I can try 'callback=this.render', callback=that.render, doesn't seem to run
[14:37:49] <richardr> I've also tried creating a function render in the global scope, passing in callback=render no luck
[14:39:20] <richardr> http://pastie.org/private/kufoainip3efw9zdpzzi6a
[14:40:11] <ajpiano> richardr: what does it look like when you use "the inline function"
[14:40:41] <ajpiano> you can't pass what's meant to be an object reference as the 'callback' parameter to $.getJSON and have it work
[14:41:35] <ajpiano> richardr: $.getJSON( this.options.url, {form: this.options.format}, $.proxy( this.render, this) );
[14:41:37] <ajpiano> does that work?
[14:43:25] <richardr> ajpiano: the apis don't accept the '_' key, i get exceptions back
[14:43:44] <richardr> ajpiano: let me try 1 sec
[14:44:06] <ajpiano> the _ is part of how JSONP works, not anything to do with how you're trying to pass the callback
[14:44:37] <richardr> ajpiano: if I pass aa function name to it, e.g. callback=render, I don't get the _
[14:44:48] <richardr> ajpiano: yes the proxy works, but doesn't use jsonp
[14:44:52] <ajpiano> richardr: if you change the cache parameter to true, you also won't get it
[14:45:20] <richardr> ajpiano: awesome, thanks :) i'll give that a go
[14:45:29] <ajpiano> $.ajax({ cache: true, dataType: "jsonp" )
[14:45:31] <ajpiano> etc
[14:46:58] <richardr> ajpiano: how does the cache param work on this field, the API gets new content quite often (Hourly ?)
[14:47:22] <ajpiano> it "busts the cache" by adding the timestamp parameter
[14:47:26] <ajpiano> known as _
[14:47:30] <ajpiano> which gives it a unique url
[14:48:02] * Conti busts caches for fun
[14:48:08] <ajpiano> if you also want a unique timetsamp on the request for that purpose you can just send foo: +new Date
[14:48:21] <ajpiano> or some other key that the API you're hitting on won't barf on
[14:49:39] <richardr> ajpiano: well with cache it works, so thanks for the help I appreciate it ;)
[14:49:54] <wookiehangover> turns out ie9 needs it in polling situations
[14:50:01] <wookiehangover> from my experience
[14:55:51] <richardr> ajpiano: unfortuantely it seems like i can pass it nothing unique. how long does cache last?
[14:56:02] <ajpiano> what
[14:56:19] <ajpiano> cache is not a real cache thing, it's a cheap trick that generates a new url for every request you make
[14:56:49] <ajpiano> if the API doesn't let you pass a param to cache bust, AND you determine that you are getting old data when you don't want it, then you should take it up with them
[15:00:15] * crab ponders using twitter bootstrap and jquery
[15:02:15] <k1ng> why $('.add_price').next() returns []?
[15:03:39] <imsky> that's a philosophical question
[15:03:59] <k1ng> http://api.jquery.com/next/
[15:04:06] <k1ng> example doesnt even work
[15:04:18] <ajpiano> ?next2 @ k1ng
[15:04:18] <bot-t> k1ng, .next("selector") is not "magically find the next element anywhere in the DOM that matches the selector". .next() looks at an element's next immediate sibling and then filters it by the selector. You might want to try .nextAll("selector").first(). (Note: .prev and .prevAll work the same way)
[15:05:05] <k1ng> $('.add_price').nextAll(":input").first()
[15:05:10] <k1ng> doesnt work :(
[15:05:35] <k1ng> $('.add_price').nextAll("input").first().val('asdasdasd');
[15:05:39] <k1ng> does nothing
[15:05:56] <crab> does $('.add_price') actually find anything?
[15:06:17] <imsky> ze goggles
[15:06:41] <k1ng> yes
[15:06:58] <ajpiano> does it have any siblings
[15:07:06] <k1ng> $('.add_price').length returns 1
[15:07:18] <k1ng> what you mean by siblings?
[15:07:30] <ajpiano> i swear to god
[15:07:41] <ajpiano> do you ever try learning anything ever
[15:07:49] <imsky> ajpiano is getting pissed
[15:07:51] <ajpiano> or do you just plan to leech on this channel until the end of time
[15:07:56] * imsky grabs popcorn
[15:08:08] <k1ng> you think i am wasting your time?
[15:08:14] <ajpiano> k1ng: how do you not know what a "sibling" in the DOM is yet?
[15:09:04] * ryanneufeld motions to imsky to pass the popcorn
[15:09:11] * imsky tosses some corn
[15:09:19] * ryanneufeld is grateful
[15:09:29] <ajpiano> k1ng: siblings are elements that are on the same level as a given element, with the same parent
[15:09:37] <ajpiano> next and previous work on siblings
[15:09:38] <Eviltwin> Are there good diagrams for explaining that?
[15:10:03] <k1ng> ah
[15:10:06] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: are you srs?
[15:10:26] <Eviltwin> I mean in terms of HTML -> Tree -> Relation
[15:10:26] <imsky> diagrams of love
[15:10:27] <k1ng> i am using table
[15:10:35] <Eviltwin> No one talks about "cousin" elements
[15:10:40] <ajpiano> k1ng: at some point during the months you were banned from this channel i thought you might have considered like
[15:10:45] <ajpiano> reading about this subject on your own
[15:10:59] <Eviltwin> And an element has only one parent so the ancestry is a little different
[15:11:08] <Eviltwin> Linear instead of branching
[15:11:09] <felipe_Brz> [JQUERYUI]why does this code not suffice to make my button change style as I hover onto it? http://pastie.org/2921688
[15:11:22] <k1ng> ajpiano, i am sorry but i had a bad day
[15:11:28] <ajpiano> you've had a bad year
[15:11:35] <imsky> a bad life, let's be honest
[15:11:36] <Eviltwin> felipe_Brz: Do you have a :hover style for it?
[15:11:53] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: that doesn't work x-browser ;)
[15:12:05] <ajpiano> felipe_Brz: applying the ui theming classes to your markup will not cause them to behave like the actual widgets
[15:12:17] <felipe_Brz> Eviltwin: I have a standard theme from theme-roller attached
[15:12:35] <Eviltwin> felipe_Brz: This sounds like a theme-roller problem, not a jQuery problem
[15:12:40] <ajpiano> it isn't
[15:12:43] <ajpiano> it's a thinking problem
[15:13:14] <ajpiano> felipe_Brz: jquery ui applies the hover classes using javascript, if you apply the classes statically to markup, the elements will not behave as though .button() was called on them, even thoug they might look liked it
[15:14:17] <felipe_Brz> ajpiano: so I have to code the behaviour for hover myself?
[15:14:31] <ajpiano> that or actually use the button widget
[15:15:08] <felipe_Brz> ajpiano: I'm not sure what this button widget is.. do you mean wijmo?

[15:17:29] <captainhook> Hello!
[15:17:31] <captainhook> http://biscotti.unleadeddevelopment.com/buy/biscotti-tv-phone.html/?1 I can't seem to figure out why the image zoom is broken in Internet Explorer
[15:17:38] <captainhook> Any Ideas?
[15:21:31] * ryanneufeld tosses ajpiano a beer
[15:22:45] <ajpiano> captainhook: any reason you're using 1.3.2 instead of a more recent version of jquery?
[15:23:21] <captainhook> no, just wat was on the site.
[15:23:32] <captainhook> ajpiano: do you think I should upgrade?
[15:24:15] <ajpiano> captainhook: it's worth a hsot
[15:24:34] <ajpiano> the code is breaking like, somewhere down the line after a jqzoom call
[15:25:01] <ajpiano> captainhook: it also helps to debug with the unminifed JS so you can see where the code is breaking
[15:25:41] <captainhook> ajpiano: unminifed js?
[15:25:46] <ajpiano> captainhook: ...
[15:25:49] <Eviltwin> Not -min
[15:25:52] <Eviltwin> Of jQuery
[15:25:56] <Eviltwin> Or whatever
[15:26:01] <captainhook> ahhh
[15:26:03] <felipe_Brz> ajpiano: so even if I have attached the jquery AND jquery UI js AND the theme css AND included the classes like in the example I still don't get the behaviour for mouse over and stuff?
[15:26:03] <ajpiano> captainhook: are you looking at this code and debugging it
[15:26:13] <ajpiano> felipe_Brz: no
[15:26:18] <ajpiano> you have to do $("#foo").button()
[15:26:21] <ajpiano> and then you get all that stuff
[15:26:27] <ajpiano> without having to do it manually
[15:26:28] <felipe_Brz> ajpiano: ok. thanks
[15:26:28] <captainhook> ajpiano: yes...
[15:26:50] <ajpiano> so you see it's like, brekaing inside of prototype, throwing all sorts of errors ther as well too?

[15:33:45] <Eviltwin> Okay
[15:33:52] <Eviltwin> Does it take arguments or something?
[15:34:01] <thebignoise> no
[15:34:15] <Eviltwin> Well what you've done will make a new one for each quoteBox
[15:34:17] <thebignoise> wait which part?
[15:34:26] <thebignoise> right thats what i want to do
[15:34:41] <Eviltwin> So is there a problem or no?
[15:34:53] <thebignoise> yes. the problem is that code doesn't work for some reason
[15:35:14] <thebignoise> $(".quoteBox").each(function(i, val){
[15:35:14] <thebignoise> 		var clip+i = new ZeroClipboard.Client();
[15:35:14] <thebignoise> 	});
[15:35:23] <thebignoise> that's what i want to do but it bitches about the var clip+i
[15:35:35] <Eviltwin> Oh, var clip+i won't work
[15:35:43] <Eviltwin> Not really sure what you're trying to do there
[15:35:56] <thebignoise> im trying to create a new clip for each quote box
[15:36:25] <thebignoise> if i just do var clip = new etc.
[15:36:30] <thebignoise> clip will be overwritten each time
[15:37:57] <thebignoise> and yes, Oh, var clip+i won't work, does not work
[15:38:54] <Eviltwin> thebignoise: Actually they won't overwrite
[15:39:03] <Eviltwin> If you're using var inside that .each function
[15:39:31] <thebignoise> how will it know which var clip to reference if they are all the same
[15:39:32] <thebignoise> ?
[15:40:33] <Eviltwin> I think you want something like this:
[15:40:34] <Eviltwin> var clips = [];
[15:40:35] <Eviltwin> $(".quoteBox").each(function(i, val) { clips.push(new ZeroClipboard.Client());
[15:40:35] <Eviltwin> });
[15:40:49] <Eviltwin> The first one is clips[0]
[15:40:53] <Eviltwin> The second one clips[1]
[15:41:06] <thebignoise> Eviltwin: ah yes that is a great idea
[15:41:37] <thebignoise> thank you
[15:42:59] <felipe_Brz> what exactly does the button() function do? http://pastie.org/2921799
[15:43:12] <ajpiano> http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/
[15:44:47] <felipe_Brz> hmmm is it the way to tell the browser that the selected items are to be treated as Jquery UI buttons?
[15:44:55] <ajpiano> yes
[15:45:43] <jbdemonte> here is my latest plugin for jQuery, an autocomplete feature : https://github.com/jbdemonte/autocomplete
[15:45:50] <felipe_Brz> ajpiano: ok thanks
[15:48:36] <kkuno> hi
[15:52:04] <k1ng> jbdemonte, no live demo?
[16:15:46] <thebignoise> is it possible to grab all flash elements on a page?
[16:29:40] <black_warlock> who can help mim
[16:29:47] <joikus> hi you guys
[16:29:58] <joikus> I have this list http://pastebin.com/yVa70FjP
[16:30:35] <joikus> each <li> has a data-countryid, I would like to set a css class to the <li> that matches my var preselectCountries = "1,4";
[16:48:53] <black_warlock> easy going
[16:49:03] <black_warlock> you can change the css using jquery
[16:49:30] <black_warlock> using .attr
[16:57:03] <gugahoi> hey fellas
[16:57:12] <PhaxeNor> hello
[16:57:37] <gugahoi> does anyone know how I could find out which timeout are currently operating in a page?
[16:58:04] <gugahoi> those timeout were set with a $(document).ready(function()
[17:00:53] <joikus> black_warlock I know but how do I find the proper li
[17:03:38] <gugahoi> anyone?
[17:09:12] <Hopsy> gugahoi: what is your question
[17:09:33] <gugahoi> I have a page that loads some timeouts on load
[17:09:48] <gugahoi> but I am unsure what timeouts are running as they vary
[17:09:49] <Hopsy> yes?
[17:09:58] <gugahoi> is there a way to check which ones are runnig?
[17:10:04] <gugahoi> like in the console or something?
[17:10:23] <Hopsy> yes
[17:10:32] <Hopsy> use firebug
[17:10:49] <Hopsy> ?firebug
[17:10:49] <bot-t> Firebug - Web Development Evolved: http://www.getfirebug.com/ , FireQuery (firebug enhancements for jQuery): http://firequery.binaryage.com/
[17:11:28] <gugahoi> I am using google chrome's developer functions
[17:11:43] <gugahoi> is firebug much better?
[17:12:12] <Hopsy> well, you can see witch load's fails in firebug
[17:12:25] <Hopsy> maybe also in google chrome dev?
[17:13:30] <gugahoi> oh well, I'll give it a try
[17:13:38] <gugahoi> but I can't seem to find them in the code
[17:13:40] <gugahoi> explicitly
[17:13:55] <Hopsy> okay
[17:14:02] <Hopsy> good luck
[17:17:11] <alex87> does anyone know of a way to set a random scroll delay for each of my jcarousels on a page?
[17:19:37] <skamikaze> alex87: pass a lambda function and use Math.random
[17:20:07] <alex87> skamikaze: so i need a lambda function... i'll look into it, thanks!
[17:28:27] <alex87> skamikaze: i'm trying to work out how to do this, you don't have any links do you?
[17:30:00] <skamikaze> i don't know jcarousel in detail, search for .animate, instead of a fixed delay use an anonymous fn
[17:30:22] <skamikaze> (it maybe uses show/ slideIn or whatever)
[17:30:57] <alex87> skamikaze: cheers
[17:31:46] <skamikaze> yvw
[17:32:18] <skamikaze> you can maybe overwrite it's animate fn if it's exposed
[17:33:46] <alex87> skamikaze: i can set a random delay under it's "auto" parametre, but i'd like each carousel instance to have a different value (currently all the same random one)
[17:35:06] <skamikaze> post the plugin dude ;)
[17:35:28] <skamikaze> (there are a lot carousels out there)
[17:49:06] <berndj> when the user clicks on some item, i'm adding #foo to window.location, and ajax-loading some stuff into a div.  But using the browser's back button leaves the page stuck with the "details" div. How do i get the overview div back?
[17:49:55] <skamikaze> ?bbq @ berndj
[17:49:56] <bot-t> berndj, BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event.

[17:51:27] <berndj> html5. hmm. but thanks for the tip
[18:05:32] <jrockjiggz> How can i check if data is set or not?
[18:06:01] <jrockjiggz> $(this).data('tab').length is throwing error because data is not set
[18:07:35] <webBuilder> hello friends, I'm using jQuery star-rating, but I want to resize it how can I do that? thank you in advance
[18:08:05] <coldhead> var thing = $(this).data('tab'); if (thing !== undefined) {...
[18:08:47] <box> hi
[18:09:16] <jrockjiggz> coldhead: thanks, it worked
[18:09:48] <box> I have a form which jquery submits using POST. Which function should I use to refresh the page or load the URL?
[18:11:39] <jrockjiggz> box: when you submit, the browser will by default go to the form action url.  if you want to stop that, you can in the submit function, setup an ajax call, and use the returned data.
[18:12:11] <box> he quit because he's a fool lol
[18:14:48] <Superstar> box: don't use jquery use location.reload();
[18:14:50] <rgoytacaz> Hello there, I have this form that has some js attached to it, when its submitted, it submits through AJAX and verifies the response, and updates or closes this form.
[18:15:04] <rgoytacaz> I want to be able to attach something after that code is done.
[18:15:13] <box> Superstar: aw thanks bro works like a charm
[18:15:20] <Superstar> box: np
[18:15:40] <jrockjiggz> rgoytacaz: add to your ajax({})   data: data  //var data = array.serialize();
[18:17:13] <jrockjiggz> rgoytacaz: $.ajax({ data: {key: 'val'}});
[18:19:47] <rgoytacaz> jrockjiggz: what If I don't have access to that ajax call.
[18:19:56] <rgoytacaz> ie: I can't change that JS code
[18:19:58] <rgoytacaz> to add anything
[18:20:21] <jrockjiggz> rgoytacaz: what is your data, an array or a string?
[18:20:34] <rgoytacaz> it would have to be done unobtrusively
[18:21:13] <jrockjiggz> u can pass like    url: url+dataStr
[18:21:27] <jrockjiggz> OR u can pass like    url: url+dataArr.serialize()
[18:22:34] <rgoytacaz> Oh, I think you misunderstood my point :)
[18:22:40] <rgoytacaz> Let me try again.
[18:22:57] <rgoytacaz> I'm trying to create a modal, that shows up a form, so users can subscribe.
[18:23:48] <rgoytacaz> just like those from grupon
[18:23:48] <rgoytacaz> or any other of those sites.
[18:23:52] <rgoytacaz> but this form is handled by a JS function.
[18:24:22] <rgoytacaz> which goes like, var form = new FormHandler('id_of_form);
[18:24:33] <rgoytacaz> this function attaches some events to the form
[18:25:02] <rgoytacaz> so when its submitted this function does its thing, like validation, and closes or shows the error to the user.
[18:25:36] <rgoytacaz> I would also like to add events to the form.
[18:26:02] <rgoytacaz> but Im wondering that if I bind to click, and assume it works, and it returns an error, my function will never know.
[18:28:01] <jrockjiggz> the function or the ajax?
[18:29:14] <rgoytacaz> my outside function
[18:29:25] <rgoytacaz> the ajax call resides in a js file I cant edit.
[18:29:36] <rgoytacaz> is there a way to attach events in the end of the chain?
[18:33:20] <jrockjiggz> rgoytacaz: .click(event, function(){});
[18:34:06] <rgoytacaz> I mean, if there are two or 3 events to the click of that element.
[18:34:17] <rgoytacaz> My function depends on the sucess of another one :(
[18:34:32] <rgoytacaz> I think its just easier to find a way to change that code ;(
[18:35:09] <jrockjiggz> do you think addEventListener will help?
[18:36:12] <jrockjiggz> rgoytacaz: look @ http://docs.jquery.com/Types/Event#event.result
[18:42:42] <rgoytacaz> jrockjiggz: OH!
[18:42:47] <rgoytacaz> thats great! :)
[18:42:51] <rgoytacaz> event.result is awesome
[18:43:04] <rgoytacaz> so I can see whats the previous event that was executed.
[18:43:12] <rgoytacaz> awesome awesome, will work with that.
[19:31:47] <macmartine> What's the best jQuery book for more dadvanced stuff?
[19:31:52] <macmartine> *advanced
[19:34:42] <adamzap> any idea why this line: $('input[name="email"]')[0].checkValidity() works on http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/validator/index.htm in chrome but not in IE8 ?
[19:35:02] <adamzap> jquery tools' validator adds checkValidity() to input elements
[19:36:30] <banfidel> i have IE 9.. can't help ya ;[
[19:36:42] <banfidel> but i can say it works fine there
[19:36:51] <adamzap> banfidel: thanks for checking
[19:37:33] <banfidel> Let me see if i can't figure out another way
[19:37:53] <adamzap> banfidel: my code should work in IE8 (because that demo does), i think it's just the way I'm accessing the array elem
[19:40:14] <banfidel> wait, i was checking flowplayer.org, what's your site so i can see your code
[19:41:35] <adamzap> banfidel: it's not public. I'm sorry. i am having the same problem because that checkValidity call errors out on IE8 on my site and the flow player demo
[19:48:35] <garann> adamzap: are you trying to call the dom element, or the jquery object?
[19:49:18] <adamzap> garann: It seems that the function is only on the DOM element, not the query object, so I have to index my selector's return to 0
[19:49:26] <adamzap> so i can get the right reference
[19:49:45] <garann> yeah, checkValidity() is native
[19:50:21] <adamzap> native like html5 native?
[19:50:25] <garann> yeah
[19:50:41] <adamzap> oh i didn't' know that, thanks
[19:51:56] <adamzap> garann: so there must be a better way to manually invoke jquery tools' validator on a field
[19:52:25] <adamzap> https://github.com/jquerytools/jquerytools/blob/master/src/validator/validator.js#L387
[19:54:17] <garann> adamzap: that wants a jquery object, doesn't it?
[19:54:27] <garann> if you get rid of the array index does it work?
[19:55:55] <adamzap> garann: no, it stops working in chrome as well if i do that
[19:56:08] <garann> oh, i see
[19:58:34] <adamzap> garann banfidel: wow, turns out I was double validating. I just had to remove the call. Thanks for the help
[19:59:20] <garann> haha, shouldn't that make it MORE valid?
[19:59:24] <garann> glad you got it working ;)
[19:59:41] <banfidel> success!! glad it's working.
[20:03:16] <adamzap> ;)
[20:06:53] <mquasar> is there a plugin to sort lists?

[20:51:14] <ch3mi0n> Evening
[21:19:59] <macrocosm> I am having some minor trouble using a var to inject an href into my tracker definition, simple example here http://jsfiddle.net/e3Gyc/27/  I know the var is working using the alert to test, but when used in my page I can see the href var still says href & did not translate, do I need special brackets around the var in this scenario?
[21:22:50] <devaholic> take off ''
[21:23:23] <devaholic> what page tracker is that
[21:23:39] <macrocosm> its from here http://manos.malihu.gr/sideways-jquery-fullscreen-image-gallery
[21:24:04] <macrocosm> I need to add the href since Drupal 7 views doesnt allow inline onClick in views setup
[21:25:42] <macrocosm> in their example he has <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/some/url');" href="/some/url" class="thumb_link">
[21:25:58] <bonhoffer> https://gist.github.com/1395084 <-- anyone see why the function isn't running?
[21:28:33] <macrocosm> I just need the url as is printed out in the alert I have in that jsfiddle the '' didnt seem to make a difference
[21:28:54] <black_warlock> guys
[21:29:01] <black_warlock> how can i solve this line
[21:29:04] <black_warlock> doubleQuotedString			: /"([^\\"\n]|\\.)*"/g,
[21:29:21] <^zoggy^> update topic. 1.7.1 is out
[21:29:28] <black_warlock> i found this is bugging everything after the line
[21:29:40] <c_t_montgomery> bonhoffer: is fit_wit_workout_id defined?
[21:30:26] <bonhoffer> c_t_montgomery, yes, i can see that from the alert
[21:31:02] <c_t_montgomery> bonhoffer: ah - i thought for some reason it wasn't getting to the alert
[21:34:44] <macrocosm> devaholic ... seems like im missing something simple here?  The error I get in firebug is in the fiddle, removing the ' ' from around the var didnt help & threw the same error.
[21:36:53] <devaholic> i dont see how pagetracker would otherwise be defined in that fiddle
[21:38:48] <macrocosm> devaholic ... yeah this is confusing me, mostly because I barely know how to work with jquery lol this seems like it should be so simple.  I can see the var is getting the url I need.
[21:39:35] <macrocosm> maybe its timing ... the tracker needs that url in place before doing somethign else
[21:42:24] <devaholic> pagetracker isnt defined in the fiddle
[21:42:41] <devaholic> dunno wth you are doing to be honest
[21:43:00] <devaholic> are you accidentally copying the guy's analytics click events that arent even part of the plugin?
[21:45:25] <luite> if I do  row = $ "<div><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></div>"  , followed by console.log row.html()   an empty line is logged, am I doing something wrong?
[21:45:57] <macrocosm> I dont think so, I used his code examples but everything mostly works... problem is I cant add inline onClicks to those links and thus the pager doesnt work since the tracker is not being used
[21:46:12] <macrocosm> but the rest of the gallery works as expected
[21:50:57] <luite> oh found it, it doesn't accept a tr in a div...
[21:53:33] <sasori> hello..if on PHP one can determine the url of the  source via $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'] ..is there a counter part of that in javascript/jquery ?
[22:06:33] <bonhoffer> i'm putting $.get("foo/"+ id) into the console and getting the same response as $.get("foo/"+ id, function(a) { alert(a);})
[22:06:48] <bonhoffer> no idea why the alert isn't running
[22:08:55] <someprimetime> if i'm posting to a controller with jquery's $.post() do I always have to send the data in a form?
[22:10:18] <doktorj> if have have 11 text boxes with the class 'findDatePicker' how do i select the 5 one in sequence?
[22:10:37] <doktorj> 5th
[22:11:10] <doktorj> someprimetime: no, you get use get also
[22:11:23] <doktorj> or put or delete ibelieve
[22:11:35] <someprimetime> doktorj: you have no idea what you are even saying
[22:11:41] <someprimetime> hell neither do i
[22:11:46] <doktorj> quite possibly
[22:11:49] <doktorj> maybei'mthinking rails
[22:11:58] <macrocosm> oh lol me too! :P
[22:12:02] <doktorj> you get use $.get with jquery i know that tho
[22:12:12] <someprimetime> uh, yes. i am aware
[22:12:22] <someprimetime> however, that isn't what i'm talking about
[22:12:37] <doktorj> oh i misread your question
[22:12:55] <doktorj> no you can send the data in json format for example
[22:12:59] <doktorj> or xml
[22:13:03] <doktorj> or text
[22:13:57] <someprimetime> so it does or does not need to be encased in a <form> to send the data to a controller (like in cake)?
[22:14:11] <c_t_montgomery> someprimetime: correct
[22:14:24] <doktorj> i havn't used cake much
[22:14:28] <someprimetime> c_t_montgomery: which one is it?
[22:14:33] <doktorj> but i would assume not
[22:14:47] <doktorj> json is pretty practical for doing that
[22:14:54] <c_t_montgomery> someprimetime: ah my bad. it does NOT need to be in a <form> tag. you can just send arbitrary data
[22:14:56] <doktorj> i use it allthe time nw
[22:14:58] <doktorj> now
[22:15:07] <someprimetime> c_t_montgomery: ok cool thanks
[22:15:34] <doktorj> json is neatly packaged and accessable as an object tho which is really nice
[22:16:27] <c_t_montgomery> doktorj: and you can use dot notation (i.e. names.first). and it mimics a js object. it's just super clean...
[22:18:29] <macrocosm> devaholic ... I think your right about the analytics stuff :/ lol dohh! too much turkey!
[22:37:57] <doktorj> arg i missed what you guys said before
[22:48:07] <jrockjiggz> <c_t_montgomery> doktorj: and you can use dot notation (i.e. names.first). and it mimics a js object. it's just super clean...
[22:48:07] <jrockjiggz> <macrocosm> devaholic ... I think your right about the analytics stuff :/ lol dohh! too much turkey!
[22:49:51] <dmc68> Schizart is in sore need of a developer. We need someone who knows CSS/HTML?PHP and can hack/mod some wordpress/buddypress templates. please contact me if you are interested, you will get full credit on the site. for more info hit up http://www.schizart.com thank you for your time.
[23:24:09] <doktorj> if ihave: psaDate = $('.grid_5.omega.date').find('.hasDatePicker').first().val()   and it works, how do i find the second and third and fourth ones in the sequence
[23:24:11] <doktorj> ?
[23:24:36] <doktorj> i wish there were second() or third() selectors but i guess there are not
[23:24:50] <doktorj> how would you guys do it?
[23:25:57] <c_t_montgomery> can you just do .next()?
[23:26:04] <c_t_montgomery> or
[23:26:17] <c_t_montgomery> you could do .index(N), where N is the index
[23:30:12] <Eviltwin> .nextAll().get(n)
[23:32:17] <luite> I think something like this would work: vals = $(.grid_5.omega.date .hasDatePicker').map -> $(this).val()
[23:32:29] <luite> oh missed a '
[23:37:27] <Eviltwin> doktorj: You want var dateCells = $('.grid_5.omega.date').find('.hasDatePicker');
[23:37:38] <Eviltwin> dateCells.get(0).val(), dateCells.get(1).val()
[23:38:05] <luite> meh that looks like something to map :p
[23:38:06] <Eviltwin> If you're trying to reference specific indicies
[23:38:18] <Eviltwin> Otherwise look at luite's suggestion
[23:39:00] <luite> oh I see mine uses coffeescript syntax, sorry for that, I hardly write plain javascript these days :)
[23:40:18] <Eviltwin> $('.grid_5.omega.date .hasDatePicker').map(function(){return $(this).val();})
[23:41:41] <Eviltwin> I've yet to see enough value in CoffeeScript
[23:41:59] <Eviltwin> A lot of the examples they showed, their translations could be shortened
[23:42:47] <luite> it's exactly these situations, small functions, where it helps for me
[23:42:58] <luite> but it's not a huge difference of course
[23:43:28] <Eviltwin> I think it makes it needlessly confusing for people trying to learn
[23:43:40] <Eviltwin> Especially when they're trying to work with an existing JavaSCript framework
[23:43:58] <Eviltwin> They end up having three different languages effectively
[23:44:29] <luite> the main thing I don't like is that you cannot explicitly scope local variables... if you have a few functiosn that use, say, x, and then you make a global x somewhere, then all used-to-be local x are now the global one
[23:44:34] <luite> and you can't do anything about it
[23:44:51] <Eviltwin> In CoffeeScript or JavaScript?
[23:44:56] <luite> coffeescript
[23:45:01] <luite> in javascript you have var
[23:45:03] <Eviltwin> Right
[23:45:41] <luite> in coffeescript I guess you could shadow it with a function
[23:46:07] <luite> (x) -> would give you another x
[23:48:08] <luite> but I'm used to writing haskell, so I like the reduced clutter for defining functions :)
[23:49:41] <luite> I'd rather write haskell instead of js, but the javascript backend for ghc is not very useful yet, and it would be a lot of work to make things like jquery usable with it
[23:50:01] <doktorj> eviltwin: nice one with the array style
[23:50:08] <doktorj> thanx
[23:50:23] <doktorj> coffee but that's fine
[23:56:21] <luckyruby> is there a way to go to a specific tab using jquery-ui tabs() from the url anchor?
[23:58:43] <doktorj> hmm, well when i tryto translateto coffeescript i get: psaDates = $('.grid_5.omega.date').find('.hasDatePicker').map -> return $(this).val()
[23:59:09] <doktorj> which gets stuff returned but is: psaDates: [object Object]
[23:59:15] <Eviltwin> luckyruby: The anchor should be the #id of the tab
[23:59:27] <doktorj> it won't let me do a date0 = psaDates.get(0).val()
[23:59:41] <Eviltwin> doktorj: Try psaDates[0]
