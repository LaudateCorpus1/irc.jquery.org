[10:41:27] <SaberArthur> hi there, I create a simple image slide in jquery, can anyone troubleshoot the problem?
[10:42:40] <Woet> SaberArthur: You don't have to ask to ask, look for experts, or state: "I have a question", Don't ask: "Is anyone around?", "Can anyone help?" or "Anyone use [...]?". Just Ask The Question. Also, please read: http://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc

[10:49:09] <SaberArthur> I try to create a simple image slider, but I can't make it loop, after image 7, it instantly change into image 1.. How to make image 7 slide to image 1?
[10:50:26] <MikeD_> are you sure you want to create an image slider?  there are already so many to choose from.
[10:50:51] <SaberArthur> this is just for learning purpose
[10:51:06] <SaberArthur> Well, the thing is, I followed exactly liek the tutorial but the result is different
[10:57:38] <SaberArthur> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkzVFB3Ba_o&list=PL6HFwAbEX7Eo_JLaIM6xsquhtND-NTYa8&index=6 it is 11:50 - 12 10. he show case that his code loop works, but mine not.. Is the problem lies on my vw/% ?
[10:58:36] <SaberArthur> nvm, just found the problem, thanks :)
[11:20:39] <twg_> Okay.  I have no clue where to start on this so I'm hoping someone can give me some advice.  I have 8 questions that have 4 radio options.  Each option is assigned a value of 0 to 3.  I'm trying to runny a tally and show it live on the page when a user is selecting their answers.  I also need it to update if a user changes their answer.

[11:35:05] <Neo_122> hi!
[11:35:23] <Neo_122> what is better learn jQuery or javascript ?
[11:35:39] <Neo_122> I started read book about javascript , but think maybe better read about jQuery
[11:35:58] <Neo_122> just I always use jQuery and not javascript , what you can advise me ?
[11:39:53] <taplar_> jQuery is javascript
[11:40:06] <taplar_> you should know javascript regardless of if you know jQuery or not
[11:40:14] <taplar_> at least to some degree
[11:41:21] <Neo_122> taplar_ , I long ago learn C++ and javascript like C++ the same syntax
[11:41:43] <Neo_122> taplar_, just think which choose for reading and improving English )
[11:41:51] <Neo_122> and skill too
[11:42:24] <taplar_> they have similar syntax but there are differences in their implementation, especially when it come to coming from a strongly typed language like C++ to a loosely typed language like js
[11:42:41] <Neo_122> taphar_ , when I something do , I always use jQuery and not pure javascript , it means better maybe read about jQuery ?
[11:43:04] <taplar_> up to you.  however everything that you learn about javascript will also apply to your knowledge of jQuery
[11:43:14] <Neo_122> taplar_, it was long ago, I've forgot C++ yet
[11:43:31] <Neo_122> and my English )
[11:43:53] <Neo_122> and apply to my English , want improve
[11:44:02] <taplar_> javascript is the language.  jQuery is a library for the language.  if ever you have trouble with the language, if your skills with the language are limited then it will hamper your ability to work through your issue(s)
[11:44:36] <Neo_122> taplar_ ok, agree
[11:45:00] <Neo_122> taplar_ will read about javascript at first , there 900 pages book
[11:45:24] <Neo_122> taplar_ and in English , my English maybe will not bad if I ended that )
[11:48:09] <taplar_> http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[11:48:15] <taplar_> https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/
[11:48:19] <taplar_> couple books there
[11:54:35] <twg_> How's it going taplar_?
[11:54:49] <taplar_> swamped, :(
[11:54:56] <twg_> I know the feeling
[11:55:12] <twg_> Sucks being a one man shop for a college
[11:55:45] <twg_> Brushing up on my javascript with my current project.
[11:57:26] <twg_> hi robertmaxrees
[12:07:32] <twg_> taplar_: can I ask you a question about best practice?
[12:07:56] <taplar_> i'd better direct you to the rest of the room
[12:08:02] <twg_> Aight.
[12:08:50] <taplar_> unless you're ok with potentially waiting a while, ^_^
[12:09:15] <twg_> I have 8 questions on my form.  Each question has 4 radio inputs with values ranging from 0 to 3.  When a user selects a radio box I need to add it to my total.  Pretty easy to do.  My biggest trouble is if the user goes back to change their value after they have already selected one.
[12:09:32] <robertmaxrees> that's easy.
[12:11:16] <twg_> robertmaxrees: what am i missing that makes it easy?
[12:11:25] <robertmaxrees> without seeing your code, I'm not sure.
[12:11:41] <robertmaxrees> but it's pretty easy to grab the values of all the selected radios and add them together,.
[12:11:43] <jak2000> hi all
[12:11:53] <twg_> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/5gwy86pk/
[12:12:05] <robertmaxrees> where's your JS?
[12:12:43] <twg_> Sorry, forgot to hit update.  https://jsfiddle.net/5gwy86pk/1/
[12:12:53] <robertmaxrees> so first off
[12:12:56] <robertmaxrees> wrong each
[12:13:13] <robertmaxrees> second off: wrong way to bind a handler.
[12:13:40] <robertmaxrees> you want the change handler instead.
[12:13:47] <twg_> okay
[12:14:03] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5gwy86pk/2/
[12:14:15] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/h4JXs/5602/    2 things in my fiddle,  why for add 1 option, the first element added is a blank line?
[12:14:34] <robertmaxrees> twg_ so now how do you think you'd add them all up?
[12:14:55] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 woah - over 5500 updates to that fiddle?!
[12:15:27] <twg_> robertmaxrees: would I just create a variable and add the values to it when they are selected?
[12:15:34] <robertmaxrees> twg_ i wouldn't.
[12:15:41] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 and the first one is blank because you're doing  $("#xcalibres").val($("#xcalibres").val() + "\n" + wcalibre); - if the value is empty, that'll just add a newline.
[12:15:58] <robertmaxrees> twg_ just get all the selected ones and add them together.
[12:16:05] <twg_> Okay.
[12:16:23] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 also, you can just do $("#btnSave").click(AlertSave);
[12:16:30] <robertmaxrees> instead of passing an anonymous function
[12:59:53] <jak2017> robertmaxrees thanks, http://jsfiddle.net/h4JXs/5603/
[13:00:02] <jak2017> how to prevent duplicate values?
[13:00:10] <robertmaxrees> yo duder
[13:00:38] <jak2017> sample: add 72
[13:00:40] <robertmaxrees> "prevent duplicate values" as in...?
[13:00:40] <jak2017> and again add 72
[13:00:44] <jak2017> not like me
[13:01:03] <robertmaxrees> so if the thing you're adding is already in there, don't allow them to add it again?
[13:02:14] <jak2017> yes
[13:02:23] <jak2017> dont allow to add it again
[13:02:35] <robertmaxrees> you can use .indexOf() so see if the dropdown value is in the value of the input
[13:02:40] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple check.
[13:03:01] <robertmaxrees> also: var wcalibre = $("#xcombcatcal option:selected").html();
[13:03:01] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:03:22] <robertmaxrees> just do var wcalibre = $("#xcombcatcal").val();
[13:03:42] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3smeq2uk/
[13:04:05] <jak2017> but val is different to text
[13:04:16] <robertmaxrees> where?
[13:04:21] <robertmaxrees> all of these are identcal.
[13:04:37] <robertmaxrees> *identical
[13:05:51] <jak2017> ok
[13:06:05] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[13:07:33] <jak2017> wich is wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/3smeq2uk/2/
[13:07:37] <jak2017> add and add same value
[13:07:59] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:08:06] <robertmaxrees> did you check the docs for indexof?
[13:09:30] <jak2017> checking
[13:09:33] <jak2017> woud be work
[13:09:48] <robertmaxrees> also, you really should get used to use === and !==
[13:14:01] <jak2017> not work :( http://jsfiddle.net/3smeq2uk/6/
[13:14:18] <robertmaxrees> open your console ;)
[13:14:29] <robertmaxrees> also: no reason to add a separate if statement here.
[13:14:49] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3smeq2uk/7/
[13:14:52] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple
[13:16:32] <jak2017> yes
[13:17:01] <twg_> robertmaxrees: I'm still a little lost on how I would actively show the total and it update based on their selections even if they change their answer.
[13:17:09] <robertmaxrees> show me what you tried.
[13:17:14] <twg_> I would have posted back to you sooner but I had someone walk into my office.
[13:17:33] <twg_> I haven't tried anything.  I'm still just trying to figure it out in my head.
[13:17:55] <robertmaxrees> so you're lost on the technique?
[13:18:00] <twg_> Yes
[13:18:07] <robertmaxrees> which part?>
[13:18:14] <robertmaxrees> (and please don't say "all of it")
[13:18:24] <robertmaxrees> like, do you know how to get all selected radios?
[13:18:26] <twg_> "ALL OF IT" . :D
[13:18:29] <twg_> Couldn't help it
[13:19:05] <twg_> I would just do a :selected correct?
[13:19:17] <robertmaxrees> yep, that's one way.
[13:19:23] <robertmaxrees> and then do you know how to add them together?
[13:20:08] <twg_> I would just do a $total += $toal + this.value ?
[13:20:22] <robertmaxrees> this.value would be a string there.
[13:20:25] <twg_> $total += this.value
[13:20:30] <robertmaxrees> so you'll need to parseInt() it.
[13:20:32] <twg_> so $(this).val()
[13:20:39] <robertmaxrees> that;'s also a string.
[13:20:43] <twg_> okay
[13:20:57] <jak2017> tkx
[13:20:59] <twg_> so $total += parseInt(this.value);
[13:21:00] <robertmaxrees> the other way is you could use a .map().get().reduce combo
[13:21:20] <twg_> Wow.  I haven't seen that before
[13:21:27] <robertmaxrees> lemme show you.
[13:21:50] <twg_> Okay
[13:25:06] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5gwy86pk/3/
[13:26:02] <robertmaxrees> twg_ ^ get the idea?
[13:27:54] <twg_> Wow.  That's awesome.  You made it look so easy
[13:28:07] <robertmaxrees> all about breaking the problem down.
[13:28:47] <twg_> I was trying to do too much all at once.
[13:28:50] <robertmaxrees> you have three things you want to do: get all the checked options, get an array of their values as numbers, then reduce it to one value.
[13:30:02] <twg_> I've never used the map or reduce function before.
[13:30:45] <robertmaxrees> pay attention to that .get() on map - jquery's .map() returns a jquery object, so we use the .get() to convert that to a normal array.
[13:31:20] <twg_> Okay
[15:28:08] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeee
[15:32:40] <hlve> weeeeeeeeeeeeee
[15:32:53] <hlve> I think my dog gave me mites.
[15:32:55] <hlve> :(
[15:33:09] <robertmaxrees> ew
[15:33:23] <hlve> I know.
[15:33:29] <hlve> I don't think it's scabies. but fuck it's itchy.
[15:43:55] <Hoder> Is there a substitute for $(this)? but instead of grabbing a single element, grabbing all of the elements of that type?
[15:44:09] <robertmaxrees> define "type".
[15:44:30] <robertmaxrees> and maybe show us what you're trying to do?
[15:44:48] <Hoder> I have a JSON schema of questions, when I first build this, when you clicked a question it populate the data into the modal
[15:45:10] <Hoder> Now I am just trying to populate all of the 'questions' into one div without a click
[15:45:33] <robertmaxrees> why not build out the markup for each one and then hide/show divs as needed?
[15:46:44] <Hoder> Here is the ajax that I was using in the Orig: https://bpaste.net/show/46fc527e1897
[15:47:06] <Hoder> I have all the questions stored and want them to show as a list in a modal
[15:47:11] <robertmaxrees> so you mean you want all $('.unanswered') within the handler?
[15:47:12] <robertmaxrees> or...?
[15:48:35] <Hoder> Unanswered was the div you click, so I'd be looking at their parents? I think. This is the line I am trying to focus on "        $('#question').empty().text(map[category].values[value].questions[tempvar].question);"
[15:48:54] <robertmaxrees> i'm way lost about what you're asking for then.
[15:49:08] <robertmaxrees> and that's a massive paste heh
[15:49:51] <Hoder> I know, I'm sorry! I'm gonna pull one of the schemas to show you real quick
[15:50:12] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle would eb killer
[15:51:15] <Hoder> This is my basic JSON file, I want to print every instance of "question" in a div
[15:51:22] <Hoder> I'll try to make one work, one momemnt
[15:55:41] <Hoder> how can I do an ajax call on jsfiddle?
[15:55:50] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to.
[15:56:03] <robertmaxrees> do you really need the ajax?>
[15:56:17] <Hoder> That pulls the question in, otherwise it's just a blank screen
[15:56:29] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:56:37] <robertmaxrees> why not just stick the base markup into the page?
[15:56:43] <robertmaxrees> instead of needing loadboard.
[15:56:50] <robertmaxrees> since your question is related to the click handler.
[15:57:04] <Hoder> yeah, I can do that. 1 sec
[15:57:23] <Al_nz1> Morning peoples
[15:57:48] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon!
[15:58:04] <Al_nz1> morning!! ;-)
[15:58:09] <hlve> AFTERNOON
[15:58:16] <robertmaxrees> FST, yo.
[15:58:20] <Al_nz1> blimin west coasters
[15:58:29] <Al_nz1> east i mean
[15:58:30] <Al_nz1> lol
[15:58:36] <robertmaxrees> *west
[15:58:42] <MagnusVortex> North coast, FTW
[15:58:56] <MagnusVortex> Nobody's ever mad at the north coasters
[15:59:22] <robertmaxrees> i am.  last time i was in eureka i just saw a ton of meth heads.
[15:59:26] <Al_nz1> I actually have a question - which could be jquery related!
[16:00:49] <Al_nz1> I want to have a very simple setup kinda of like a comments area. Two textareas, textarea1 is readonly and scrollable, textarea2 you can type a comment into, and when you click a submit button the comment is sent into textarea1 with a date & time stamp prepended
[16:01:07] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[16:01:28] <sdaf> Hi, it's me again, can somebody help me with this problem where I have a slide module and the icons changes to x when the module is open..
[16:01:36] <sdaf> https://jsfiddle.net/d0s3wg5b/1/
[16:01:45] <robertmaxrees> sdaf sure - what's your specific question?
[16:01:49] <sdaf> If you click one and click x to close it's fine.. but when the module is open and you click the other icon they both become x
[16:01:49] <sdaf> I want them to be alternative and correspond to apporpriate content
[16:02:56] <Hoder> robermaxrees  having trouble getting it to work perfectly, but this should give you an idea: https://jsfiddle.net/jsLLnhmg/
[16:04:19] <robertmaxrees> Hoder erm
[16:04:24] <robertmaxrees> that's a lotta js.
[16:04:27] <robertmaxrees> so where should i be looking?
[16:04:28] <Hoder> that's what i'm sayin' lol
[16:04:37] <Hoder> I can chop it down
[16:04:38] <Hoder> 1 sec
[16:04:44] <robertmaxrees> also you've got jquery in there twise.
[16:04:46] <robertmaxrees> *twice
[16:05:07] <MagnusVortex> double checked
[16:05:35] <Hoder> https://jsfiddle.net/jsLLnhmg/1/
[16:05:48] <Hoder> try that, around line 14 is where I load the question in using a $(this)
[16:06:10] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jsLLnhmg/2/ with the second version of jquery killed.
[16:06:30] <robertmaxrees> i still don't understand your question.
[16:07:17] <robertmaxrees> also there's a console error and you're missing data.
[16:09:46] <Hoder> That's what I mean, the ajax is pulling in all of thje question info from the schema, but I can't figure out how to just print every 'question' variable from the schema
[16:09:47] <Al_nz1> something like this was what I was after, but I seem to have to select the text before it copies : http://jsfiddle.net/QenBV/1/
[16:09:51] <Al_nz1> I dunno why?
[16:10:14] <robertmaxrees> getSelectedText
[16:10:26] <sdaf> if somebody could help
[16:11:10] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 so you want to take the text from the input, put it in the other input with a timestamp, and then what>?
[16:11:18] <robertmaxrees> did you want to cler that input out?
[16:11:38] <robertmaxrees> also: this has nothing to do with jquery fwiw.
[16:12:03] <uskerine> hi, any recommendation for cookie EU banner?
[16:12:11] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yeah so I modified that fiddle so it copies everything.....but if text is already in the target box it should be append.
[16:12:12] <robertmaxrees> "cookie EU banner"?
[16:12:26] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 huh?
[16:12:42] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 errr - so then don't use getSelectedText() ?
[16:13:10] <uskerine> robertmaxrees, I mean those banners that overlaps the website (usually they remain at the lower side of the screen) until user press "I accept"
[16:13:19] <uskerine> they are mandatory in the EU
[16:13:22] <robertmaxrees> then make one?
[16:13:32] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't be too hard.
[16:13:52] <uskerine> I am sure there is a ready to use lightweight library or code
[16:14:05] <robertmaxrees> then do what the rest of us would do
[16:14:41] <uskerine> robertmaxrees it is a valid question
[16:14:47] <robertmaxrees> google :)
[16:14:58] <uskerine> getting feedback from people with more experience than you
[16:15:04] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahahahaha
[16:15:13] <robertmaxrees> yikes
[16:15:17] <robertmaxrees> sorry you're having a bad day.
[16:15:39] <robertmaxrees> either way, that's super easy to build yourself.  no need to import an entire other dependency for it.
[16:19:09] <uskerine> robertmaxrees everything is easy when you master something
[16:19:16] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[16:19:49] <robertmaxrees> so you insult my intelligence, ask in another channel, get the same answers, then come back here and contradict your insult?
[16:20:07] <robertmaxrees> good luck duder :)
[16:24:50] <IamTrying> http://paste.ubuntu.com/24362962/ - How to remove the <li> ? (its not removing onClick)
[16:27:06] <robertmaxrees> what is
[16:27:06] <robertmaxrees> $.tpt.prototype.clickRead = function(msg) {
[16:28:31] <robertmaxrees> also: use js for your binding handlers instead
[16:28:45] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: what am I missing? Shouldnt the date be prepended for each click of submit? http://jsfiddle.net/QenBV/363/
[16:28:52] <IamTrying> robertmaxrees: its loaded onBoot as: var tpt = new $.tpt({});  and then used in other onClick events to trigger member functions as like `tpt.RobertMaxRees();`
[16:29:10] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 still a js question :)
[16:29:28] <robertmaxrees> IamTrying 'kay.  either way, use jq to bind your handlers instead.
[16:31:40] <robertmaxrees> your problem is that 'this' isn't what you think it is there.
[16:32:06] <IamTrying> robertmaxrees: not clear. you mean replace line 6 and line 13 onClick to general JS methods?
[16:32:23] <robertmaxrees> remove onclick there and use js/jquery to bind instead, yeah.
[16:34:06] <IamTrying> robertmaxrees: but inside the UL > all the LI is coming from AJAX where JS/JQuery fail if i dont use onClick embedded like i did.
[16:34:20] <robertmaxrees> then use a delegated listener instead.
[16:34:28] <IamTrying> should i not pass onClick=tpt.RobertMaxRees(this, 1); like that?
[16:34:31] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:34:35] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea.
[16:34:44] <robertmaxrees> are you appending to that UL in the ajax call?
[16:35:00] <robertmaxrees> put differently, does the UL exist on pageload?
[16:35:22] <IamTrying> robertmaxrees: Apeending to the UL (in pre ajax call and onClick to X i need to erase the unread messages)
[16:35:30] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[16:35:32] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[16:35:37] <IamTrying> robertmaxrees: YES UL exist on Page Load
[16:35:38] <robertmaxrees> read these and they'll tell you what you need.
[16:35:45] <IamTrying> OK
[16:36:07] <robertmaxrees> this will also fix the problem you're currently having btw.
[16:38:17] <IamTrying> Thank you robertmaxrees

[16:54:57] <pascal_> Can you tell me, if a gallery like this http://annalomax.com/  we can do with jquery even the responsive side?
[17:00:40] <hlve> responsiveness should NOT be done via JS.
