[00:18:07] <Jonno_FTW> corbyhaas: yes
[00:33:21] <_August_> anyone know of a jquery plugin with this same type of image zoom? http://codepen.io/xporter/pen/vEeqxw
[00:33:50] <_August_> except it doesnt stop when the zoom finishes, it reverses
[00:40:49] <_August_> anyone?
[00:42:21] <Jonno_FTW> _August_: use a jquery event to setup a reverse animation when it finishes?
[00:43:57] <Jonno_FTW> actually just uset setTimeout for 8 seconds, set the reverse animation
[00:44:20] <_August_> kinda didnt want to use css 3 for it
[01:14:25] <Jonno_FTW> well css is probably going to make the best use of hardware acceleration
[02:18:23] <hellyeah> so
[02:18:30] <hellyeah> load and get is for same task
[02:18:46] <hellyeah> but get method is for xml, json whereas load is only for html
[02:19:42] <Cork> not really
[02:19:51] <Cork> load is for loading the response into an element
[02:20:02] <Cork> $.get is for loading the response into a variable
[02:22:31] <hellyeah> ic
[02:23:37] <hellyeah> with get can you get json into variable that is returned in the backend?
[03:39:31] <hellyeah> hey there
[03:39:45] <hellyeah> i just want to learn personal preferences
[03:40:10] <hellyeah> in ajax call what do you have? "success","error" is enough to have or do i have something else?
[03:49:06] <xec> hellyeah: I use .done(), .fail() and .always()
[03:53:50] <hellyeah> guess it is success, error and complete right
[03:54:09] <hellyeah> okey i noted
[05:35:25] <hwdyki> how do i obtain the Nth column given a table $(row)?
[05:36:27] <Cork> $(row).find('td:nth-child(N)')
[05:36:35] <Cork> or $(row).children('td:nth-child(N)')
[05:36:46] <Cork> or $(row).children(':nth-child(N)')
[05:37:01] <Cork> or $(row).children().eq(N)
[05:37:02] <Cork> :)
[05:37:47] <Cork> hwdyki: though note that WON'T adjust for colspans
[05:37:53] <Cork> or rowspans
[05:41:59] <hwdyki> works like a charm. thanks.
[05:55:16] <hwdyki> can i ask a datatables qn?
[06:05:06] <hellyeah> hey
[06:05:18] <hellyeah> okey now i am using done, fail and always
[06:05:59] <hellyeah> i am calling function in done function thats okey i guess in fail i will return some alert that includes the infos that is given by fail parameters thats fine
[06:06:05] <hellyeah> these are understandable
[06:06:19] <hellyeah> but i am nor 100% clear why i use always function
[06:06:31] <hellyeah> in jquery page that alert "complete"
[06:06:53] <hellyeah> but afaik using alert is not suggested because it freeze the page
[06:07:16] <hellyeah> what do you you think? what do you suggestion? using always is mandatory or necessary or totally optional?
[06:15:32] <xec> hellyeah: only use .always() if you need it for something, its completely optional (as is .fail really, if you don't care if it fails)
[06:15:56] <xec> hellyeah: i usually use it for things like a loading indicator
[06:16:20] <xec> (i want it to stop loading when the ajax is comlete, whether it failed or not)
[06:17:49] <hellyeah> got it
[06:18:13] <hellyeah> done and fail is kinda important
[06:18:18] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:18:39] <hellyeah> always if you need tro load something everytime
[06:18:43] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:19:08] <xec> you can think of .always() like a "done or fail"
[06:19:11] <hellyeah> when you said indicator can it be smt like brief explanation of how system works?
[06:19:23] <xec> i mean like a spinner
[06:19:31] <xec> or a text that says "Loading..."
[06:19:38] <hellyeah> ic
[06:19:39] <glowdemon1> Could someone look at this simple piece of code (http://www.hastebin.com/ijazawodaq.xml) and tell me whats wrong? I can't seem to create the divContent var
[06:19:52] <hellyeah> thats a good idea
[06:20:00] <hellyeah> load thing seems nice
[06:20:25] <hellyeah> what about when page load, done will be carried out.
[06:20:27] <hellyeah> like
[06:20:47] <hellyeah> you have loading text on screen and there is a circle moving around
[06:20:56] <Xatenev> glowdemon1: what is the error?
[06:21:06] <hellyeah> and when page loads the buttons menu etc will be visible
[06:21:09] <hellyeah> does it make sense
[06:21:12] <glowdemon1> Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[06:21:13] <xec> hellyeah: i don't quite follow
[06:21:18] <xec> hellyeah: on page load?
[06:21:19] <hellyeah> hmm okey
[06:21:27] <hellyeah> my english kinda bad let me try again
[06:21:40] <glowdemon1> hold on
[06:21:44] <hellyeah> when page loads you will see loading on the screen right
[06:22:03] <glowdemon1> Nvm yeah, I can't seem to assign the div to divContent
[06:22:04] <hellyeah> when page load finishes success or fail function is carried out
[06:22:08] <hellyeah> is that true?
[06:22:30] <Xatenev> glowdemon1: missing semicolon?
[06:22:33] <hellyeah> like button is coming here https://jsfiddle.net/Lf2q8wu0/55/
[06:22:38] <xec> hellyeah: not page load, but the ajax call, yes
[06:22:39] <Xatenev> glowdemon1: in line 11 maybe?
[06:22:54] <hellyeah> xec: sorry for my wrong usage
[06:23:17] <hellyeah> before buttons come up i can show loading with a circle surrond the loading right
[06:23:23] <glowdemon1> Yeah, fixed that. Stil lteh sae
[06:23:26] <Xatenev> glowdemon1: k
[06:23:26] <glowdemon1> still the same*
[06:23:35] <hellyeah> and when button shows up loading is just gone away
[06:23:39] <hellyeah> does it make sense
[06:23:43] <hellyeah> could you follow now?
[06:24:01] <xec> hellyeah: yes
[06:24:11] <hellyeah> i am glad
[06:24:16] <hellyeah> does it make sense?
[06:24:22] <xec> hellyeah: in your case the buttons are constructed after an ajax call is completed, right?
[06:24:40] <hellyeah> yes
[06:24:46] <hellyeah> in done function
[06:24:56] <xec> yes, then you can show a loading spinner or something while it's working
[06:25:09] <Xatenev> glowdemon1:
[06:25:13] <xec> just show the spinner before the ajax call, and hide it again in the always callback
[06:25:21] <Xatenev> glowdemon1: http://hastebin.com/apubeyovof.xml
[06:25:24] <hellyeah> xec: beforeSend seems more logical or not?
[06:25:27] <Xatenev> try to replace ur var divContent line
[06:25:28] <Xatenev> with mine
[06:25:46] <xec> hellyeah: no need, just do it on the line before the ajax code
[06:25:48] <Xatenev> glowdemon1: and tell me if it works ;)
[06:26:02] <hellyeah> xec: okey let me try it thats good idea
[06:26:08] <hellyeah> just a circle and letter
[06:26:15] <hellyeah> may be animation on the circle
[06:26:35] <glowdemon1> Still nope :(
[06:26:37] <hellyeah> like circle is spinning let me try that now
[06:26:40] <xec> hellyeah: i often use font awesome myself; http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/#animated
[06:26:40] <Xatenev> glowdemon1: sure?
[06:26:43] <hellyeah> than you xec
[06:26:44] <Xatenev> glowdemon1: cause it just worked for me
[06:27:01] <hellyeah> aha
[06:27:05] <hellyeah> thats really nice
[06:27:20] <glowdemon1> sec
[06:27:35] <hellyeah> xec: which one you like most?
[06:27:44] <hellyeah> this arrow one looks fancy to me
[06:27:45] <xec> i use the fa-refresh
[06:27:47] <glowdemon1> I copied it incorrectly
[06:27:49] <Xatenev> glowdemon1: it works great dude
[06:27:49] <xec> :D
[06:27:56] <glowdemon1> Doesn't give me the error anymore, thanks
[06:27:59] <glowdemon1> What was wrong with it?
[06:28:06] <Xatenev> glowdemon1: u copied that code from somewhere right?
[06:28:16] <Xatenev> maybe jsfiddle?
[06:28:27] <hellyeah> eheh
[06:28:34] <glowdemon1> What code?
[06:28:36] <hellyeah> we have same taste here xec
[06:28:36] <Xatenev> ur code
[06:28:39] <Xatenev> this div content stuff
[06:28:42] <glowdemon1> Oh no, from my old HTML doc
[06:28:53] <Xatenev> well yea, u copied illegal characters with it
[06:29:00] <Xatenev> which are "invisible"
[06:29:05] <Xatenev> maybe U+200B http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/200b/index.htm
[06:29:09] <glowdemon1> Ah
[06:29:10] <Xatenev> something into that direction :)
[06:29:19] <glowdemon1> Well, thanks alot
[06:29:28] <Xatenev> np
[06:30:45] <hellyeah> can i do less in jsfiddle
[06:30:48] <hellyeah> i am not sure
[06:32:31] <dudeJi> hi guys , i am trying to create a nested javascript index array and then JSON.stringify(jsArray); to generate json response.
[06:32:54] <dudeJi> can i create a 2 dimensional index javascript array
[06:33:59] <hellyeah> xec: i didnt see but iss there any js file there
[06:34:08] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/f87zusv3/1/ this doesnt have fa-refresh
[06:34:18] <hellyeah> btw jsfiddle doesnt support sass
[06:35:47] <dudeJi> jsonResponse['field_options']['description']=hintText;
[06:35:55] <dudeJi> error is field_options is not defined
[06:36:17] <xec> hellyeah: font awesome is a font file and a css file
[06:36:55] <xec> hellyeah: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/get-started/
[06:37:10] <hellyeah> okey thank you
[06:37:54] <xec> (actually several font files, but you get the idea)
[06:38:13] <hellyeah> ahah
[06:38:18] <hellyeah> :D:D:D
[06:38:27] <hellyeah> i got it xD
[06:38:37] <hellyeah> i am working on big company and writing frontend
[06:38:50] <hellyeah> this little trick they will like fo sho xD
[06:39:36] <hellyeah> so i will call that first
[06:39:45] <hellyeah> and at the beginning of other method
[06:39:52] <hellyeah> i will make that div invisible
[06:39:55] <hellyeah> thats nice
[06:40:08] <hellyeah> may be i can remove the div completely
[06:40:12] <hellyeah> what do you think?
[06:40:36] <xec> .hide() and .show() os probably good enough
[06:40:50] <hellyeah> ic
[06:40:51] <xec> is*
[06:41:13] <hellyeah> hmm it is not working in i.e. 9
[06:41:23] <hellyeah> good enough to have i.e. 10 and 11
[06:51:21] <hellyeah> seems easy css example doesnt need font
[06:51:33] <hellyeah> i am not sure i can use ruby gem with asp.net
[06:57:27] <hellyeah> xec: thisd file is not working https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.4.0/css/font-awesome.min.css
[06:57:31] <hellyeah> not accessible
[07:46:54] <hellyeah> xec: nice https://jsfiddle.net/w5yomb0k/
[07:47:10] <hellyeah> i can prefer to make this bigger
[07:47:54] <hellyeah> hmm actually i dont know how to make this bigger
[07:47:56] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:00:30] <taplar> hellyeah: you can treat those icons as fonts: https://jsfiddle.net/w5yomb0k/14/
[08:01:38] <hellyeah> taplar: btw do you think this extra movement seems nice or not  https://jsfiddle.net/fLsnr1k8/2/
[08:01:57] <taplar> uh, no
[08:02:02] <hellyeah> i got it
[08:02:12] <taplar> looks like your just playing around
[08:03:10] <hellyeah> taplar: okey then https://jsfiddle.net/fLsnr1k8/3/
[08:03:43] <taplar> i take it this is a busy spinner?
[08:04:02] <hellyeah> well i want to use that spinner
[08:04:07] <hellyeah> like loading
[08:04:15] <hellyeah> when buttons comes up spinner goes away
[08:04:42] <taplar> yeah a busy spinner, shows while an ajax request is running and goes away when it's done
[08:05:42] <hellyeah> is it called busy spinner
[08:05:47] <hellyeah> hmm didnt know that
[08:06:00] <hellyeah> damn english is really flexible and metaphoric
[08:06:02] <xec> hellyeah: https://jsfiddle.net/w5yomb0k/16/
[08:06:07] <hellyeah> metaphor is hard to grasp
[08:06:15] <xec> sorry you got an answer already didnt you
[08:06:54] <hellyeah> xec: more than one answer is good
[08:07:02] <hellyeah> deciding
[08:07:06] <hellyeah> :d
[08:07:08] <hellyeah> just a sec
[08:12:40] <hellyeah> hey how can i do an animatrion in "..."
[08:12:53] <hellyeah> like . .. ..., . .. ..., . .. ...
[08:13:05] <hellyeah> in one sec there will bnbe one more point
[08:13:11] <hellyeah> humm
[08:17:11] <taplar> hellyeah: https://jsfiddle.net/w5yomb0k/17/
[08:17:32] <taplar> not what you were asking about, but has an overlay
[08:17:48] <taplar> to help prevent users from clicking other things while the ajax is running
[08:18:31] <taplar> heh, and just noticed i mixed camel case and '-' class names, :s
[08:20:54] <hellyeah> ic
[08:21:08] <hellyeah> it can takes more then 5000 right
[08:21:24] <taplar> if it's tied to an ajax call you wouldn't do it like that
[08:21:31] <hellyeah> i guess in css - is ok to use
[08:21:43] <taplar> you could show it in beforeSend and hide it in complete or always
[08:22:24] <hellyeah> can i call function in done function?
[08:22:34] <hellyeah> before the function that create the button?
[08:22:57] <taplar> done take a callback function.  you can do whatever you normally can do in a function in that function
[08:23:01] <hellyeah> i guess if i do that it will spin forever
[08:23:37] <hellyeah> can i mix done and beforeSend
[08:23:41] <hellyeah> ops sorry
[08:23:51] <taplar> they are two different callbacks
[08:24:20] <hellyeah> what are those?
[08:24:32] <hellyeah> hmm callback is really important concept
[08:24:54] <taplar> you'd use beforeSend and complete: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[08:25:11] <hellyeah> okey .show this in beforesend
[08:25:15] <hellyeah> hide n complete
[08:25:19] <hellyeah> in*
[08:25:19] <taplar> yep
[08:25:47] <hellyeah> this is what i try to do btw https://jsfiddle.net/fLsnr1k8/34/
[08:25:59] <hellyeah> i just need an animation here to make this look fancy.
[08:26:29] <hellyeah> guess i can add . to the div "animated" in every one sec
[08:26:36] <hellyeah> i mean
[08:26:41] <taplar> or change the width with an overflow of hidden
[08:26:46] <hellyeah> like string += . in every one sec
[08:26:59] <hellyeah> overflow in hidden
[08:27:02] <hellyeah> ?
[08:27:06] <hellyeah> i dont know that part
[08:27:18] <hellyeah> can you be clear
[08:27:29] <taplar> overflow: hidden; makes things that don't appear in the visible space now be scrollable to
[08:27:39] <hellyeah> yeah
[08:27:42] <hellyeah> sorry
[08:28:03] <taplar> so you could put all three dots there with the width set to be wide enough to show all of them
[08:28:05] <hellyeah> but i didnt exceed the border of screen
[08:28:11] <taplar> then on animate, change the width to only show one
[08:28:15] <taplar> then on animate, change the width to only show two
[08:28:18] <taplar> then on animate, change the width to only show three
[08:28:21] <taplar> repeat
[08:28:40] <taplar> 'visible space'
[08:28:43] <taplar> not the window
[08:28:58] <taplar> an element with a fixed width has that much visible space
[08:31:07] <hellyeah> i am not so clear about the way you describe still try to understand
[08:31:16] <hellyeah> sorry i am just fool sometimes :X
[08:32:26] <hellyeah> but it seems okey too
[08:32:27] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/fLsnr1k8/39/
[08:43:10] <hellyeah> taplar: i am trying this https://jsfiddle.net/fLsnr1k8/46/
[08:43:25] <hellyeah> but there is only one dot
[08:49:00] <canine> Can someone help me? Im trying to filter results based on its text. So if you type a name in the input, it will only show results based on what was typed in.
[08:49:05] <canine> I created a fiddle, any kind sould wants to help?
[08:49:07] <canine> http://jsfiddle.net/ytYQd/1185/
[08:49:11] <canine> soul*
[08:49:51] <canine> So if you type "Aline" in the input, it would show only the first div ".item"
[08:56:26] <taplar> hellyeah: https://jsfiddle.net/fLsnr1k8/57/
[08:57:14] <hellyeah> does it look good "two animations"
[09:08:17] <taplar> canine: maybe something like this http://jsfiddle.net/ytYQd/1186/
[09:12:51] <canine> that is brilliant!
[09:17:57] <canine> it works great inside the fiddle, but after minifying it i get an error Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'eq' of undefined
[09:19:11] <taplar> that would indicate that items were not found
[09:19:42] <taplar> so your putting this in an external .js file?
[09:20:50] <canine> yes i renamed the variable without "$"
[09:20:52] <canine> and it worked
[09:21:00] <canine> not sure why, but it did :)
[09:21:09] <taplar> huh?
[09:21:37] <canine> i think its the uglyfing that did not like variables with $
[09:21:42] <canine> 				var items = $('.item');
[09:21:44] <canine> worked
[09:21:59] <taplar> weird. shouldn't have an issue with that, :s
[09:22:19] <taplar> but whatevs, :)
[09:22:29] <taplar> i was thinking there might be a small improvement to that though
[09:23:33] <canine> Well it did work :)
[09:23:35] <canine> Thanks alot
[09:23:38] <canine> taplar++
[09:24:04] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/ytYQd/1187/
[09:24:16] <taplar> that one has a little less lookups
[09:27:11] <canine> works great aswell
[09:27:12] <canine> thanks
[09:42:13] <hellyeah> yo
[09:42:21] <hellyeah> fail function has three parameter jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown
[09:42:34] <hellyeah> which one is more preferred
[09:42:41] <hellyeah> do i need to have all of this?
[09:42:48] <hellyeah> what do you prefer at this point?
[09:44:57] <hellyeah> jqXHR is an object do i need foreach or smt?
[09:44:58] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/Lf2q8wu0/57/
[09:54:17] <taplar> include what you need
[09:54:29] <taplar> otherwise you don't have to take any of them
[09:54:50] <hellyeah> actually i am not clear what i need but i just try to dig in
[09:55:22] <hellyeah> it was good if i would get statuscode
[09:55:23] <taplar> then don't include any of them.  then later when you find you need to do something, look at the docs to see if one of those three parameters will help you achieve what you want
[09:56:05] <hellyeah> textStatus seems help full to me
[09:56:12] <hellyeah> helpful
[09:56:15] <taplar> you should be able to get the status code from the jqXHR i believe.  however, simply by being in success or fail, you know you got a certain type of code
[09:56:45] <hellyeah> actually ajax has something for statuscode
[09:56:55] <hellyeah> ajax page has an example for 404
[09:56:56] <taplar> yep
[09:57:04] <taplar> if you want to go that route you can
[09:57:14] <hellyeah> what i wonder is , is there any particulat status code i need to focus on
[09:57:30] <hellyeah> but there is a lot of html code
[09:57:48] <hellyeah> hmm i cannot write something for every possible status code
[09:58:02] <hellyeah> if i dont remember wrong there is 20 status code "error code"
[09:58:14] <hellyeah> i guess redirect code is also counted as error code
[09:58:26] <hellyeah> so i need to repor 300,400,500 probably
[09:58:31] <taplar> you can have 0-999 status codes
[09:59:03] <hellyeah> wikipedia does have between 200 and 500
[09:59:06] <taplar> you don't 'have' to account for all the status codes.  just the ones the endpoint can return that concern you
[09:59:06] <hellyeah> is there more?
[09:59:21] <hellyeah> well i am not clear on that
[09:59:33] <taplar> status code allows for a range of 000-999.  there are set standard ones, but you can make your own
[09:59:34] <taplar> brb
[09:59:39] <hellyeah> because i saw bad gateway error, bandwidth error, page not found error
[09:59:51] <hellyeah> taplar: okey thanks see you tmorrow
[10:00:02] <hellyeah> thank for teaching me
[10:10:55] <taplar> bak
[10:13:41] <Xatenev> is .click() != mobile tap?
[10:15:30] <taplar> i believe i saw someone mention that mobile will fire a click in some cases
[10:15:50] <Xatenev> in some cases?._.
[10:16:28] <taplar> click might be fired at the time of a double tap, but not a single tap
[10:16:32] <taplar> not sure though
[10:16:52] <taplar> not really a mobile person myself
[10:18:10] <fifthshift> hey I have a JSON object which I would like to turn into a javascript object or array or something that I can easily grab data/perform operations with
[10:18:19] <fifthshift> it's in the following format: http://pastebin.com/bKhhWVbs
[10:18:36] <taplar> fifthshift: you can do JSON.parse(string)
[10:18:48] <fifthshift> right on taplar
[10:18:50] <taplar> or $.parseJson(string) for older browsers
[10:18:59] <fifthshift> what will that return?
[10:19:07] <taplar> a javascript object
[10:19:39] <taplar> or an array i believe, but that depends on your json
[10:19:47] <Xatenev> taplar: solved
[10:19:54] <Xatenev> on('touchstart click') solves
[10:19:55] <Xatenev> :p
[10:19:59] <taplar> :)
[10:20:00] <fifthshift> okay, thank you taplar
[11:46:59] <mooru> Hello guys. i have an input filed that takes a phone number but i will like to delete the first 4 digits as people enter the fields. how can i ahieve this
[11:47:13] <robertmaxrees> show us what you have so far.
[11:47:17] <robertmaxrees> and what you've tried :)
[11:48:39] <hexdj> if you delete digits as they type people will get annoyed and start over
[11:48:49] <robertmaxrees> i don't think that's what they mean.
[11:49:22] <mooru> http://pastie.org/10527076
[11:49:24] <robertmaxrees> which is why an example would be nice
[11:49:50] <robertmaxrees> mooncup so you want to replace the first 4 only if they contain certain numbers?
[11:50:00] <robertmaxrees> eeerr, mooru
[11:50:15] <mooncup> no I do not >:(
[11:50:26] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[11:50:53] <mooru> no i want to delete them as people type
[11:51:07] <robertmaxrees> so if they type a 2, 3, 4, or 0, delete those?  why?
[11:51:16] <robertmaxrees> you realize people will think something is broken, right?
[11:51:25] <taplar> just ignore them on the back end
[11:51:44] <mooru> no. thats the way it should be for certain reasons
[11:51:47] <taplar> need validation there anyway
[11:51:56] <robertmaxrees> taplar but if you're going to show them to the end user later, they'll then think something broke.
[11:52:02] <robertmaxrees> mooru i'd do it on blur
[11:52:03] <taplar> true
[11:52:26] <fartface> I'm getting back data in a different character set when I use IE than when I use Chrome doing AJAX requests.  Is there any way to force a character set for a response?
[11:52:28] <mooru> ok
[11:52:47] <taplar> does blur fire if the user hits enter?
[11:52:53] <taplar> didn't think it did
[11:53:10] <robertmaxrees> taplar i'd have to see more of this form - keyup is definitely the wrong way to do this either way.
[11:54:13] <robertmaxrees> so mooru should it be only of the input starts with '2340'?
[11:55:24] <mooru> Yes
[11:56:02] <NoiseEee> fartface: the server should be taking care of that
[11:57:06] <robertmaxrees> 'cause i mean http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3hgjpdx1/ is what you'd want.
[11:57:56] <fartface> NoiseEee: That's what I figured, but there's also the W3C spec saying XMLHttpRequests have to be returned in UTF-8, which is screwing things up because the data should be returned in windows-1252 (don't ask, it's a gross legacy system lol)
[11:58:31] <fartface> I've got the right character set coming back with Chrome, but IE is ... apparently adhering to the standards, which is kind of shocking lol
[11:58:44] <NoiseEee> fartface: well its fine not to conform to spec as long as consumers of the request know about it, but just make sure your backend is sending windows-1252 explicitly?
[11:59:18] <fartface> But for an HTML output document, isn't that as simple as using <meta charset="windows-1252">?
[11:59:38] <fartface> Cause I've got that immediately after the doctype/head tag
[12:00:57] <robertmaxrees> fartface as an aside, IE is actually far more standards compliant than most people think - chrome actually tends to be less compliant.
[12:01:14] <robertmaxrees> it's a source of confusion for a lot of folks because they actually expect the broken behavior.
[12:02:20] <fartface> robertmaxrees: Learning web development having to support the old, old, IE versions has put it pretty firmly in my head it's broken, but I've been noticing that lately.  Too bad their developer tools are such crap in comparison to Googles, and that they don't support extensions.
[12:02:36] <robertmaxrees> i actually don't like chrome's tools.
[12:02:47] <robertmaxrees> IE11s are nice imo.
[12:03:33] <fartface> They look decent, but the behaviour of them doesn't seem to be consistent for me--I'll set a breakpoint and it won't fire, even when I absolutely know that it should, and it does in every other browser.
[12:03:49] <robertmaxrees> sounds like maybe a misunderstanding then.
[12:03:52] <robertmaxrees> they've always worked fine for me.
[12:04:14] <NoiseEee> fartface: your XHR shouldn't be returning a full document really
[12:04:21] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:04:24] <NoiseEee> fartface: and the server can send headers, not <meta> tags
[12:05:13] <mooru> robertmaxrees: thanks. Just what i needed
[12:05:48] <fartface> NoiseEee: Ah, I get what you're saying with headers now, I was thinking in terms of a full document.  Only problem with that... like I said, old ass legacy system...  I have to use workarounds just to get the damn thing to output a DOCTYPE and not just <HTML></HTML>...  It's brutal.
[12:06:25] <fartface> That said, that's exactly the information I needed, because it makes my job easier to be able to push back and say that it needs to be in the system.
[12:06:46] <fartface> Thanks!
[12:10:32] <NoiseEee> you're welcome
[12:18:31] <fartface> Actually, maybe not...  When I look at the Response Body in the network tab (IE), the characters show up correctly.  What the hell lol
[13:13:31] <fartface> So if I've got an AJAX response, and that displays correctly in the browser, but if I console.log that response, there are character issues, where would I even begin to debug?
[13:13:55] <rindolf> Hi all. Sup?
[13:14:58] <robertmaxrees> fartface what are the "character issues"?
[13:16:20] <fartface> One sec I'll upload some screenshots
[13:17:29] <fartface> robertmaxrees:  So this is my response body in IE for the request http://i.imgur.com/rPnHp9U.png
[13:18:02] <NoiseEee> why
[13:18:10] <NoiseEee> why is there a full document coming back in an XHR request?
[13:18:14] <robertmaxrees> that's a terrible response body for an ajax call btw.
[13:18:30] <NoiseEee> XHR is for loading certain data only, and/or some markup
[13:19:03] <fartface> Like $.load()?
[13:19:18] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:19:23] <fartface> console.log comes back with http://i.imgur.com/MsonnIi.png
[13:19:31] <robertmaxrees> unless you're, for some reason, only grabbing part of that entire page.
[13:19:42] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:19:47] <robertmaxrees> so where's the issue here?
[13:19:56] <NoiseEee> fartface: it an inappropriate response, end of story
[13:20:18] <fartface> NoiseEee:  I'm not disagreeing, I'm trying to get more information so that I can learn from my mistakes.
[13:20:19] <robertmaxrees> fartface it's a bad response to give, and what's the difference between those two screenshots?
[13:20:35] <NoiseEee> fartface: the more information is "return an appropriate response"!
[13:20:39] <NoiseEee> i dunno what else to say
[13:20:59] <robertmaxrees> fartface is it literally that one has colors and stuff and the other one doesn't?
[13:21:13] <fartface> robertmaxrees: See the part with the XML element <record>, there's an element in there, DESC_FRENCH, which is supposed to say Frere, but in the console.log, it has Fr[]
[13:21:23] <fartface> No, no, nothing like that.
[13:22:18] <NoiseEee> fartface: well for one, i'm assuming you're still relying on a META tag  for the encoding; your browser gets it, but bare data does not
[13:22:24] <NoiseEee> fartface: two issues, actually three
[13:22:41] <NoiseEee> fartface: 1) set headers on the server   2)  don't return a full document   3) until you do those things, you are wasting your time and our time
[13:22:42] <NoiseEee> good luck!
[13:22:53] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:23:59] <fartface> NoiseEee:  I appreciate that, but wouldn't the headers be returned in the response as well?  I can show you my response headers--nothing in them gives *me* any clue as to what to do with the information which is why I'm asking.
[13:24:12] <robertmaxrees> fartface meta tags are not headers.
[13:24:18] <fartface> I'm not talking about the meta tags
[13:24:47] <fartface> http://i.imgur.com/4fxQaXl.png
[13:24:48] <robertmaxrees> then i'm not sure what you're confused about.  just that you're not sure how to set encoding for a response?
[13:25:26] <robertmaxrees> rather, the charset for the response?
[13:25:28] <fartface> There's no clue as to the encoding that's being returned with the response in IE's dev tools as best as I can see, given that I never use them.
[13:25:45] <robertmaxrees> right - so the browser is trying to guess.
[13:25:52] <fartface> OHHHH
[13:25:58] <fartface> So there's never a default.
[13:26:02] <robertmaxrees> well, sort of.
[13:26:09] <robertmaxrees> the browser tries to figure it out if you make a boo-boo.
[13:26:12] <robertmaxrees> you want to set the charset encoding.
[13:26:20] <robertmaxrees> err, charset, not encoding.  i am off today.
[13:26:35] <fartface> Right, right, that makes sense, and that would be set by that "legacy application" I was talking about, yeah?
[13:26:51] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what that's referring, but that's set by your server.
[13:27:00] <robertmaxrees> fix the response body and the charset and call it a day.
[13:27:16] <fartface> When you say server though, are you referring to IIS, or the application that's sending the data to IIS to serve?
[13:27:24] <NoiseEee> IIS
[13:27:30] <NoiseEee> the actual thing spitting out the XHR response
[13:27:43] <NoiseEee> should also set appropriate headers
[13:27:45] <robertmaxrees> ^ you probably want it to be the same for the entire application.
[13:28:09] <fartface> Ah, thanks, I'm really sorry for the stupid questions, but the more I learn, the less I feel like I know if that makes sense.
[13:28:40] <fartface> And given that, I appreciate being able to ask questions, stupid as they may sound to people who know the answers--that's how I learn, so thank you.
[13:38:30] <taplar> doesn't really make sense for the people who know the answers to ask the questions
[13:38:32] <taplar> :P
[13:38:47] <robertmaxrees> i don't think the issue was ever that questions were being asked.
[13:55:01] <krambiorix> hi, i have a string with in it a whole html document . How can i parse this to an object?
[13:55:07] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[13:55:11] <robertmaxrees> why would you have that?
[13:55:21] <krambiorix> i get that back from the server :)
[13:55:27] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty bad.
[13:55:33] <robertmaxrees> should only get back the bits you actually need.
[14:02:37] <adavia> any idea why i get this unexpected token: error http://jsfiddle.net/N7avm/133/
[14:03:32] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, because i return a whole view ...
[14:03:40] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix you shouldn't do that.
[14:03:48] <robertmaxrees> you should only return the part of the markup you need.
[14:05:19] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, but everything in the view is generated ..
[14:05:43] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix literally nothing you can say will change the fact that returning an entire document in an ajax call is a bad idea.
[14:05:47] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:05:52] <robertmaxrees> you can work around that, but it's gross.
[14:06:04] <robertmaxrees> either way, a quick google search should be able to help you sort that out.
[14:06:09] <robertmaxrees> you can also use .load9)
[14:06:13] <robertmaxrees> *.load()
[14:06:40] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, ok i'll do it the clean way
[14:16:15] <zeldaF> I'm looking to build something like this: https://wordpress.org/plugins/visual-form-builder/screenshots/
[14:16:33] <zeldaF> does anyone know of a jquery library that does something like that?
[14:17:06] <zeldaF> Basically i want a drag and drop interface with different forms
[14:17:20] <zeldaF> and then when the user hits save it converts those forms to JSON
[14:19:21] <fifthshift> okay so I have an AJAX post going on which returns a JSON
[14:19:40] <fifthshift> and I'm trying to get that JSON into an object to parse for a particular field
[14:20:15] <fifthshift> or, if there's no data (ie, due to the page on the other end of the post failing to grab the right data, and returning an error)
[14:20:49] <fifthshift> to do a different thing; in this case display a message saying "stuff went wrong"
[14:21:11] <robertmaxrees> fifthshift this is taking a long time.  you want to know if there was a response and, if so, do something with it.
[14:21:17] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, show a failure message?
[14:21:20] <fifthshift> yeah sorry
[14:21:21] <fifthshift> basically
[14:21:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:21:28] <fifthshift> I have that working, except
[14:21:42] <robertmaxrees> hey - it's ok to type full sentences and hit enter when you're done ;)
[14:21:42] <fifthshift> let me show some code real quick that'll make this easier
[14:22:42] <fifthshift> http://pastebin.com/w1VApd5J
[14:23:00] <fifthshift> whoops, should have included the post function
[14:23:20] <fifthshift> http://pastebin.com/7m7i0Utr
[14:23:22] <fifthshift> that's better
[14:23:39] <robertmaxrees> so first of all, you see the syntax error in here, right?
[14:23:50] <fifthshift> negative
[14:23:56] <robertmaxrees> $('#formMessageArea').html("Error submitting ticket.);
[14:23:58] <robertmaxrees> missing a quote.
[14:24:22] <fifthshift> ah! okay. let me fix that
[14:24:24] <robertmaxrees> also, you're confused about how ajax works :)
[14:24:37] <robertmaxrees> var respObj = post("otherpage.asp", formData); won't ever work.
[14:25:07] <robertmaxrees> ajax is asynchronous
[14:25:53] <robertmaxrees> also: the return inside of xhr.onload = function() { returns to the post, not the entire post itself.
[14:26:02] <robertmaxrees> so you have a few levels here you're confused by
[14:26:07] <fifthshift> ah okay
[14:26:26] <robertmaxrees> you should check out using $.ajax() instead - it makes all of this a lot simpler.
[14:27:06] <robertmaxrees> then all of that logic that relies on the call finishing goes in .done() or .fail()
[14:27:13] <robertmaxrees> and don't use try/catch blocks in cases like this.
[14:28:42] <fifthshift> okay
[14:29:25] <fifthshift> that's what I sort of figured the problem was partially due to, the asychronous nature of the ajax post
[14:29:44] <fifthshift> I'll look into $.ajax
[14:30:11] <fifthshift> ty robertmaxrees
[14:30:34] <adavia> any idea why i get this error unexpected token :  http://jsfiddle.net/N7avm/133/
[14:31:23] <robertmaxrees> adavia might be trying to handle that like a jsonp request instead?
[14:32:15] <adavia> robertmaxrees: i guess so but i needed to be jsonp as its a cross domain request
[14:32:30] <robertmaxrees> adavia then you need to properly support jsonp
[14:32:40] <adavia> how
[14:32:48] <robertmaxrees> need to wrap the response in a function call.
[14:34:13] <adavia> um
[14:34:21] <robertmaxrees> read up on jsonp.
[14:34:23] <robertmaxrees> that's how it works :)
[14:36:31] <robertmaxrees> the request to your server has a callback arg - you need to wrap the response from the server with that name as a functioncall.  so like &callback=someFunctionName - you server returns someFunctioName({someResponseData: 'foo'});
[14:38:22] <adavia> robertmaxrees: and what about using YQL
[14:38:30] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:38:35] <robertmaxrees> just fix the endpoint and call it a day.
[14:38:41] <robertmaxrees> do you not control the other server?
[14:38:45] <adavia> no
[14:40:12] <robertmaxrees> proxy through your own box then.
[14:41:14] <adavia> havent done that before. Will dig in
[14:41:27] <robertmaxrees> node+restify. easy combo
[14:41:38] <adavia> just checked https://learn.jquery.com/ajax/working-with-jsonp/
[14:41:44] <adavia> thats why asked
[14:41:48] <robertmaxrees> except you're not using jsonp in this case.
[14:42:29] <robertmaxrees> and that's just giving you and example - YQL won't like magically hit some other page afaik
[14:43:35] <adavia> seems like managing cors is quiet a job
[14:43:45] <robertmaxrees> you have nothing to "manage" in this case.
[14:44:08] <robertmaxrees> without running your own server-side setup, you can't work around it.
[14:44:59] <adavia> true.. but sometimes you want to use some external api
[14:45:19] <robertmaxrees> but that external api doesn't want to expose their end users to unnecessary risk.
[14:46:01] <robertmaxrees> think of it this way: imagine if CORS didn't exist - i could very easily make a page that could scrape your entire inbox from gmail.
[14:46:05] <robertmaxrees> or whatever email service you use
[14:48:48] <adavia> yeah make a whole sense
[14:50:49] <adavia> but then again some sites grant you access to their apis..
[14:51:19] <adavia> so i have to still check how to access in this case
[14:55:16] <cuppy> Hi, all - does the $.each() function decide how many indexes to iterate before it begins iterating? I'm using $.each() to iterate and delete array entries if they match a certain value, and it *seems* like $.each() is trying to iterate using the initial length of the array.
[14:56:04] <taplar> cuppy you probably want to use filter instead
[15:02:35] <cuppy> taplar, .filter() only works on DOM objects?
[15:03:07] <cuppy> oh wait - it looks like it supports more than that
[15:03:49] <taplar> another option would be http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/
[16:17:25] <fifthshift> so I took a step away from the ajax thing
[16:17:39] <fifthshift> and now coming back to it, I'm stuck on an "unexpected token" problem with the response
[16:17:59] <fifthshift> pastebin containing the relevant info: http://pastebin.com/6BpkhEq1
[16:18:45] <robertmaxrees> skip the $.parseJSON step.
[16:18:47] <robertmaxrees> see if that worlks.
[16:18:48] <robertmaxrees> *workls
[16:18:56] <robertmaxrees> i cannot type today haha
[16:18:56] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:19:06] <fifthshift> I tried that earlier; changed it to var newTaskID = data.record;
[16:19:27] <fifthshift> actually I might have been doing it the other way; like newTaskID = data['record']
[16:19:28] <robertmaxrees> do console.log(typeof data);
[16:19:35] <fifthshift> will do, to both
[16:19:40] <robertmaxrees> oh, and also;
[16:19:50] <robertmaxrees> you're sending back an array of 1 item.
[16:20:08] <robertmaxrees> so data.record/data['record'] (which are identical) will never work
[16:20:18] <robertmaxrees> need to grab the 0 index of that array.
[16:20:26] <fifthshift> says it's a string
[16:20:29] <fifthshift> typeof data = string
[16:20:35] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, you need the parsing step.
[16:20:42] <fifthshift> okay
[16:20:49] <fifthshift> ideally this will only ever be a 1 item array
[16:20:56] <robertmaxrees> then don't make it an array.
[16:20:58] <fifthshift> but it is possible that multiple records will return if something screwed up
[16:21:07] <robertmaxrees> err.
[16:21:13] <robertmaxrees> then var respObj = $.parseJSON(data); var newTaskID = respObj[0].record; i guess?  that sounds sloppy though.
[16:21:28] <fifthshift> that's not much different than what I already had
[16:21:38] <fifthshift> let me see if adding the element index helps
[16:21:41] <robertmaxrees> accessing the 0th index always is lazy though.
[16:21:48] <robertmaxrees> you should really filter that down server-side.
[16:22:26] <fifthshift> holy crap it worked
[16:22:29] <fifthshift> thank you robertmaxrees
[16:22:34] <fifthshift> yeah I'd like to
[16:22:47] <fifthshift> but I'm not positive yet that duplicate entries won't happen
[16:23:10] <fifthshift> I'm gonna put a TODO on this page reminding me to look at that later
[16:24:07] <fifthshift> I'm still in the beginnings of playing with jquery
[16:24:27] <fifthshift> and you've helped tremendously for this part of this project today robertmaxrees
[16:24:29] <fifthshift> ty again
[16:25:53] <robertmaxrees> back.
[16:26:02] <robertmaxrees> fifthshift you should really resolve that array thing.
[16:26:11] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise you need to actually handle multiple entries.
[16:30:47] <fifthshift> robertmaxrees it's a matter of the classic asp library I'm using to generate the JSON on the server side
[16:31:06] <robertmaxrees> should be able to filter out to just the first result, but okay.
[16:32:26] <fifthshift> yeah, but the library always creates an object
[16:33:04] <robertmaxrees> the contract would be that there's always an object.
[16:33:18] <robertmaxrees> but an array implies you expect (and will handle) more than 1 object.
[16:33:35] <fifthshift> I'll have to to a string replace on the outer brackets
[16:33:45] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:33:52] <fifthshift> or something along those lines, when I know that there is only one object and not an array
[16:34:01] <robertmaxrees> is it a db call or something getting the data?
[16:34:13] <fifthshift> yes, and then the ArraytoJSON library which assembles it
[16:34:14] <robertmaxrees> something here is code smell.
[16:34:24] <robertmaxrees> oh, it's in the name :(
[16:34:27] <fifthshift> yup
[16:34:44] <robertmaxrees> gross.
[16:34:55] <fifthshift> par for the course for classic asp in general
[16:35:08] <fifthshift> I can work with it, but it'll have to be something like the workaround I mentioned
[16:35:18] <robertmaxrees> i'd find a library that's less foul personally.
[16:35:24] <robertmaxrees> don't edit it as text.
[16:35:31] <robertmaxrees> but whatevs
[16:35:42] <fifthshift> -nod-
[16:35:56] <fifthshift> I'll be looking into it tomorrow
[16:36:00] <fifthshift> I'm out for tonight though
[17:20:17] <libracious> hey
[17:21:29] <robertmaxrees> hello
[17:38:50] <acidjazz> hello robertmaxrees
[17:38:53] <acidjazz> hi thre
[17:39:56] <robertmaxrees> ohai
[18:05:17] <jak2000> hi all
[18:05:32] <jak2000> exist a $("#fpallsumerg").reload ?
[18:05:44] <robertmaxrees> what do you expect that to do?
[18:07:02] <jak2000> same as reset
[18:07:04] <jak2000> the form
[18:07:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:07:14] <jak2000> a relad (Smilar when user press F5)
[18:07:26] <robertmaxrees> resetting a form and reloading the page are very different things.
[18:07:56] <jenelizabeth> Hi all, are there any recommended Jquery tutorials pls?
[18:08:03] <robertmaxrees> jenelizabeth learn.jquery.com
[18:08:06] <jak2000> mmm similar to F5
[18:08:16] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 so you want to reload the page?
[18:08:30] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you can't "reload part of a page" without some gross hacks.
[18:15:12] <jenelizabeth> Thank you :)
[18:21:54] <jak2000> iwant reload all page
[18:22:43] <robertmaxrees> quick google search :)
[18:29:58] <adavia> robertmaxrees: is this what you meant by using a proxy? https://jsfiddle.net/3q6oto6v/
[18:30:16] <robertmaxrees> nope
[18:32:34] <adavia> uf
[18:38:14] <robertmaxrees> adavia what I said was "<robertmaxrees> proxy through your own box then."
[18:38:38] <adavia> what does own box means?
[18:38:54] <robertmaxrees> your own server.
[18:38:58] <adavia> ok
[19:47:22] <jeffreylevesque> what's the purpose of avoiding multiline strings?
[19:47:23] <jeffreylevesque> why is it not good practice?
[19:47:50] <robertmaxrees> hard to read.
[19:47:53] <robertmaxrees> like, really hard to read.
[19:48:09] <robertmaxrees> 9/10 multiline strings are really templates.
[19:49:29] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque why do you ask?
[19:59:58] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: my jscs lint recommends against it - https://travis-ci.org/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/builds/89128520#L1297
[20:03:41] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque yeah, you really want a template of some kind.
[20:04:03] <jeffreylevesque> ah
[20:04:12] <jeffreylevesque> i've slated to replace my implementation with angular
[20:04:21] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, build up using native DOM methods or whatever element creation syntax you want.
[20:04:23] <jeffreylevesque> but, that might be sometime
[20:04:39] <robertmaxrees> why angular?
[20:05:03] <jeffreylevesque> my js is ugly
[20:05:17] <jeffreylevesque> making an excuse to try angular, since it's a big thing
[20:05:20] <robertmaxrees> eeeeh
[20:05:21] <jeffreylevesque> i donno
[20:05:23] <robertmaxrees> i'd use react
[20:05:35] <robertmaxrees> or even vue or backbone
[20:05:41] <robertmaxrees> or pretty much anything but angular haha
[20:06:31] <jeffreylevesque> hm, guess i'll have to revisit this
[20:06:43] <jeffreylevesque> i've been spending too much time trying to implement linting :(
[20:07:04] <robertmaxrees> good thing to implement.
[20:07:06] <jeffreylevesque> cleaning linting, which introduces my clumsy human error, so i have to clean up logic error after fixing linting
[20:07:18] <robertmaxrees> though you could have done that in your editor at first ;)
[20:07:20] <robertmaxrees> anyway, enjoy.
[20:07:30] <jeffreylevesque> yeah :(
[20:07:39] <jeffreylevesque> i wasn't into best practices to begin with it seems
[20:22:16] <broman> i have a $#div.load function that gets one <a href="" onclick="jsfunction()">... how can i eval this?
[21:01:05] <acidjazz> eval()
[22:44:25] <stilton2000> i'm trying to access key1 in each object but get undefined, why? http://jsfiddle.net/qvfkn04r/
[23:25:33] <danle> hey all
[23:26:29] <danle> anyone know why a function might work when called from one link and not when called from another? Even though I can verify that its using the same variables in both instances?
[23:29:33] <danle> I have7 links calling a function ... 2 of them work, 1 on them works with the values from all 6 other links... and works...
[23:59:46] <JosefDe> Hi Hey guys. How can I put my tooltip into this orange div?: http://jsfiddle.net/g74Ep/436/
