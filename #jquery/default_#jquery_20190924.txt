[03:57:08] <smart_ptr> hey guy
[03:57:11] <smart_ptr> Any idea what's wrong here? :O
[03:57:18] <smart_ptr> $("#secondary li").each(function() { $(this).on("click", function() { $(this).find("a").click(); } ) })
[03:57:30] <smart_ptr> I have a lot of <li> containing <a>
[03:57:43] <smart_ptr> I want: if you click the <li>, the <a> within should be clicked
[03:58:05] <smart_ptr> Though, I'm getting: Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[06:42:01] <Stoot> When I have a list of <li> items and I want to pick out the one without a href, would that be possible ?
[07:06:30] <Stoot> I'm not sure if I need a loop there
[07:21:04] <Cork> Stoot97: $('li;not([href])')
[07:21:27] <Stoot97> Cork thanks! Going to test that out
[07:33:09] <Stoot97> Should a selector always work if the element order is right and it exists anywhere in your HTML ?
[07:33:43] <Cork> Stoot97: as long as you don't limit it in range, or the element doesn't exist yet
[07:33:54] <Cork> (if it is added later it won't find it)
[07:34:30] <Stoot97> Cork ok, so plain stuff like this should the span ? var span = $("tfoot > tr > td > ul > li > span");
[07:34:59] <Cork> do you really need all that direct child limitation?
[07:35:07] <Cork> it makes the selector much heavier
[07:35:33] <Stoot97> for testing now yes, I mostly clean it up later on
[07:35:40] <Cork> (avoid > unless you absolutely need it)
[07:35:51] <Cork> cause it makes things slower, not faster
[07:36:00] <Stoot97> ok!
[07:36:19] <Cork> for example do you reall have nested trs in your tfoot?
[07:36:48] <Cork> anyway ya, the selector should work as long as you really don't have any extra nesting in there
[07:39:12] <Stoot97> meh I cannot get the text() out of the span
[07:39:35] <Cork> create a jsfiddle
[07:43:05] <Stoot97> when I select all spans and console.log them don't receive the value of <span>1</span>
[07:43:22] <Stoot97> that that be because of load order ?
[07:43:56] <Cork> do you run your javascript in the body of the page?
[07:44:09] <Cork> (if so, not at the absolute end?)
[07:44:27] <Stoot97> yes but this should be catched on load
[07:44:44] <Cork> on load? you mean the load event?
[07:45:10] <Stoot97> no page load
[07:45:33] <Cork> well where your js is executing matters
[07:45:46] <Stoot97> yes I think that is going wrong
[07:45:52] <Stoot97> not sure yet
[07:46:17] <Cork> can't really help you unless you give me something to look at...
[07:53:35] <Stoot97> yes I'm figuring out first what happens on load order
[07:54:54] <Stoot97> yeah it's order
[08:01:56] <Stoot97> what, or is it, possible to set an variable in your code on line 100 which you it's value on line 500 on loading the code ?
[08:02:07] <Healyhatman> Greetings peeps, I'm having a problem with typeahead if someone can steer me in the direction of where exactly I am wrong
[08:11:35] <Healyhatman> No peeps :(
[09:25:29] <Cork> Stoot: js runs in syncronysly normally, but each block is executed as the html parser finds script tags
[09:25:39] <Cork> so when js runs the full dom page might not be there yet
[14:45:47] <Stoot> Cork yes that was happening
[14:46:11] <Stoot> but wasn't sure how flexible dom was
[15:38:35] <GreenJelly> https://jsfiddle.net/z2req9dj/2/#&togetherjs=yc5k2FdFri
[15:38:40] <GreenJelly> Need help on this one
[15:38:56] <GreenJelly> The adding of the class select doesn't work
[15:39:07] <robertmaxrees> within if (targetId = 'profile_data_sex_female') { ?
[15:39:25] <robertmaxrees> GreenJelly
[15:39:35] <GreenJelly> excuse me?
[15:39:50] <robertmaxrees> which part specifically doesn't work?
[15:40:11] <GreenJelly> Any attempts to get the select on the parent class of the input is incomplete
[15:40:20] <GreenJelly> I can get it to work on the label
[15:40:24] <GreenJelly> and the parent container
[15:40:34] <robertmaxrees> can you point to a specific line?
[15:40:41] <GreenJelly> but then can't get it if you click the checkbox itself
[15:41:05] <GreenJelly> Ive tried a number of methods.
[15:41:26] <robertmaxrees> sorry, i'm really unclear about what specifcally you're having an issue with :/
[15:42:13] <GreenJelly> when you click on the items label, checkbox, or parent container.   It should set the parent class to select.
[15:42:23] <GreenJelly> when you click on the items label, checkbox, or parent container.   It should set the parent class with the checkbox to select.
[15:42:39] <GreenJelly> It doesn't do this.... I
[15:42:51] <robertmaxrees> well, for starters, your if statements are brokn.
[15:42:53] <robertmaxrees> *broken
[15:43:06] <robertmaxrees> if (targetId = 'profile_data_sex_female') { is assigning targetId to that string, not comparing.
[15:43:15] <robertmaxrees> which is always going to come back as truthy.
[15:43:29] <robertmaxrees> you want if (targetId === 'profile_data_sex_female') {
[15:44:15] <GreenJelly> Yes, still wont work with that.
[15:44:19] <GreenJelly> 							let parent1 = $('div.profile_data_sex_male');
[15:44:29] <robertmaxrees> second, do you have much flexibility with how the markup is structured?
[15:44:30] <GreenJelly> Adding this will help in some places... but not all
[15:44:46] <robertmaxrees> you have to do that in all heh
[15:44:54] <GreenJelly> As long as the checkbox is displayed and names are the same.
[15:45:29] <robertmaxrees> i might look into doing this with a pure css solution.  otherwise, this is actually pretty simple in JS.
[15:45:41] <GreenJelly> It should be.
[15:45:46] <robertmaxrees> :) one sec.
[15:45:52] <GreenJelly> But there are bubbling going on
[15:46:19] <robertmaxrees> the "right" way to do this is to bing to the change event of the inputs, then use .closest() and go from there.
[15:46:21] <GreenJelly> And for some reason, when you click on the checkbox (input) it behaves differently then the label
[15:46:28] <robertmaxrees> *closest to find the parent div
[15:46:59] <GreenJelly> The change event is not triggered if you click on the actual checkbox for some reason.  Probably the bubbling
[15:47:30] <GreenJelly> I"ve spent about 5 hours today on this....
[15:47:37] <GreenJelly> Ive tried about 20 methods
[15:47:39] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kbco3xy1/ seems to work find here.
[15:48:02] <GreenJelly> sorry, its not
[15:48:06] <robertmaxrees> *fine
[15:48:10] <robertmaxrees> it's logging for me in the fiddle.
[15:48:11] <GreenJelly> the select class is not beign assigned to the parent
[15:48:13] <robertmaxrees> is it not for you?
[15:48:23] <robertmaxrees> correct, because i removed a lot of code to prove a point.
[15:48:30] <robertmaxrees> sorry for trying to help.
[15:49:00] <GreenJelly> I need the select class to be added to the selected input child... I can get what you're doing already with my code
[15:49:12] <GreenJelly> That is when things get hairry
[15:49:17] <robertmaxrees> trying to help you find the solution.
[15:49:25] <robertmaxrees> but fine.
[15:49:25] <GreenJelly> Yep, and thank yo
[15:49:28] <robertmaxrees> let me do this for you.
[15:49:44] <GreenJelly> I'm not hostile, or toxic.  Just informing
[15:49:51] <GreenJelly> I'm thankful
[15:49:58] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: you're coming across as angry.
[15:50:17] <GreenJelly> I'm frustrated at it not working... not angry at you.  Very greatful
[15:50:21] <GreenJelly> I can't seem to see it
[15:50:38] <GreenJelly> I'm frustrated at how much stupid time this has taking
[15:50:42] <GreenJelly> I'm frustrated at how much stupid time this has taked
[15:50:50] <GreenJelly> (before you)
[15:51:01] <GreenJelly> I'm very greatful someone is looking at it
[15:51:33] <robertmaxrees> so this is the start: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kbco3xy1/1/
[15:52:23] <GreenJelly> That does not allow the containing class to be clicked to activate the input
[15:52:40] <GreenJelly> That's why I got all the other code
[15:52:46] <GreenJelly> It causes a bubble to form
[15:52:53] <robertmaxrees> your third issue is that you need to modify your markup so the label is what has the box.
[15:52:54] <GreenJelly> Which is why all the other code was there
[15:52:57] <robertmaxrees> instead of a containing div.
[15:53:08] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise you're monkeypatching built-in behavior.
[15:53:30] <GreenJelly> That would be fine... but I need the checkbox styling
[15:53:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:53:35] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:53:48] <robertmaxrees> so change the markup so use a wrapping label and ditch the div that's there.
[15:54:03] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to refactor CSS, but then you don't have to reimplement browser behavior
[15:54:08] <GreenJelly> I had that, and could not find a way to apply the styling this way
[15:54:27] <robertmaxrees> should be pretty easy.  if you get stuck there,  I'd ask in #css.
[15:54:32] <robertmaxrees> it looks like you have it mostly there.
[15:54:46] <GreenJelly> :(
[15:54:51] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:55:13] <GreenJelly> I went to the new styling because it was the only way I knew how to do this.
[15:55:31] <robertmaxrees> which is fine - there's an entire channel that can show you the right way :)
[15:56:10] <GreenJelly> Ahh, so GUT everything I did... all because I can't get the SELECT class to show up when the checkbox is clicked on the checkbox?
[15:56:20] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[15:56:23] <robertmaxrees> not 'gut'.
[15:56:26] <robertmaxrees> but fix, yeah.
[15:56:33] <GreenJelly> Yea, tear EVERYTHING apart and redo
[15:56:37] <GreenJelly> Is what your saying
[15:56:42] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:56:48] <robertmaxrees> why are you being so negative?
[15:57:02] <GreenJelly> Because I'm so close and am beign told to throw it away
[15:57:18] <robertmaxrees> it's a good learning experience :)
[15:57:53] <robertmaxrees> but fine: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kbco3xy1/2/
[15:57:59] <robertmaxrees> when this breaks, lemme know :)
[15:58:03] <Stoot> Oh man I love the jQuery syntax like it's my dog and I love her more then a lot!
[15:58:50] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:59:45] <GreenJelly> Javascript, and Jquery is about as ass backwords as possible
[15:59:50] <GreenJelly> that looks like its working
[15:59:58] <GreenJelly> lets see if it will work on mine
[16:00:07] <robertmaxrees> GreenJelly please pull back on the attitude.
[16:00:13] <Stoot> yep, goes way along! 11pm she comes to me and directs me to bed, so there is a lot of hugging there under the blanket, then think back to jQuery :)
[16:00:40] <robertmaxrees> ... k...
[16:01:19] <Stoot> yap, can't help she detected my diabetics last year and wanted to guidance me :)  pretty awesome tho
[16:02:17] <Stoot> and during winters it's freaking cold here, even with a bedwarmer so better stay together then
[16:02:39] <Stoot> I can create small clouds while breathing out
[16:06:41] <GreenJelly> robert, looks like it looses sink on the live one when I click the label at times.  It fails to set the selected.
[16:07:11] <GreenJelly> robert, not sure why you think I got an attitude.
[16:07:31] <Gh0st_Preacher> it's all good duder.  just coming across terse, that's all :)
[16:07:35] <GreenJelly> But what do I need to say/jump through to show my greatful
[16:07:43] <GreenJelly> I say I'm greatful
[16:07:58] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[16:08:09] <robertmaxrees> but seriously, i would refactor that to not need the JS.
[16:08:09] <GreenJelly> Welcome back
[16:08:29] <robertmaxrees> you can do all of this with CSS.
[16:08:59] <robertmaxrees> GreenJelly keep it in the channel.
[16:09:13] <GreenJelly> I can't share the URL with the public
[16:09:22] <robertmaxrees> what's to say my logs aren't public? :)
[16:09:33] <robertmaxrees> if you can't share it to the channel, i don't want to see it.  sorry.
[16:09:48] <robertmaxrees> completely defeats the purpose of the channel.
[16:09:49] <GreenJelly> It's a private project thats not released...
[16:10:01] <GreenJelly> Then sorry, but your solution doesn't seem to work in live.
[16:10:15] <robertmaxrees> bummer. if you can replicate on the fiddle, i'll be happy to look! :)
[16:10:21] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, do the css version :)
[16:10:25] <robertmaxrees> #css is a great resource for that.
[16:19:07] <Stoot> I like those refactors over refactors that prove someone wasn't a pro at all :)
[16:19:17] <GreenJelly> Unfortunately, there seems to be issues with the code you provide as well Robert.  You've done a lot to simplify the problem I face.  Just can't really isolate it.
[16:19:30] <robertmaxrees> GreenJelly bummer.  i'd move on to the CSS driven solution then.
[16:20:08] <GreenJelly> guess it's not such an easy problem to solve. :(
[16:20:16] <robertmaxrees> it is if you do it correctly.
[16:20:19] <robertmaxrees> like with CSS.
[16:24:34] <GreenJelly> Robert, correctly?  You mean to tell me Jquery can't do this?  That If I use JQuery, I'm... Incorrectly using it?  Sounds like an issue with Jquery then.
[16:24:54] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:24:59] <robertmaxrees> you CAN do it with jquery
[16:25:00] <GreenJelly> Yep
[16:25:04] <robertmaxrees> but it's the wrong fit :)
[16:25:24] <robertmaxrees> jquery because you can use jquery to do something doesn't mean it's the right tool for the job.
[16:25:37] <robertmaxrees> *just because you can use, rather
[16:26:12] <GreenJelly> Unless the requirements was to use the HTML as given...
[16:26:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:26:21] <GreenJelly> Then
[16:26:28] <GreenJelly> Its the only job
[16:26:30] <GreenJelly> Goodluck!
[16:26:33] <robertmaxrees> why are you so resistant to doing this with CSS?
[16:26:52] <GreenJelly> I'm actually not, It just offers other problems
[16:27:01] <robertmaxrees> like?
[16:27:01] <GreenJelly> And I thought this was "easy"
[16:27:07] <robertmaxrees> i mean.
[16:27:17] <robertmaxrees> i was able to fix the original issue by writing less code.  so it likely is.
[16:27:27] <robertmaxrees> but without seeing this new problem, it's hard to know what the solution is.
[16:27:34] <GreenJelly> Except, it never fixed the issue
[16:27:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:28:01] <robertmaxrees> it fixed your original problem statemenet.  moving the goalposts and claiming "it's still broken" is kinda weird, but okie :)
[16:28:03] <robertmaxrees> good luck! :D
[16:28:29] <GreenJelly> if you fixed it, I'd agree.  But you showed me what I was already seeing.  Just "simplier" and more like my original solution (that also didn't work)
[16:28:42] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: dunno what to tell you then.
[16:28:45] <robertmaxrees> bummer!
[16:28:47] <GreenJelly> I wanted to figure out why this wasn't working
[16:28:54] <GreenJelly> Figure its a JQuery difference
[16:29:10] <robertmaxrees> *jQuery, and what do you mean "difference"?
[17:11:05] <GreenJelly> Just an FYI robert, it appears that this is NOT possible by putting the input within the label... http://form.guide/snippets/html-radio-button-label.html
[17:11:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:13:01] <robertmaxrees> where in that page does it say it's not possible?
[17:15:26] <GreenJelly>   <label>Choose one option: </label>
[17:15:36] <GreenJelly> That is not within. :(
[17:15:49] <robertmaxrees> did you even read the page?
[17:17:28] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[17:17:32] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9xho710e/
[17:17:37] <robertmaxrees> just for the record.
