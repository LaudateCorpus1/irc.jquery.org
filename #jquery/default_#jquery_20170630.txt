[03:05:50] <Cork> latemus: if you want to SEND json you need to use $.ajax(url, { contentType: 'application/json', data: JSON.stringify(form.serializeArray()) })
[04:21:28] <Neo_papa> hi guys
[04:21:33] <Neo_papa> :)
[04:22:10] <Neo_papa> I need sent ajax request form where is input[type=file]. How can I do this right ?
[04:22:44] <Neo_papa> and what means async : false ?
[04:23:40] <Neo_papa> it means I will send only one request and wait while handling till end previews ? ? ?
[04:23:48] <Neo_papa> what do you think ?
[04:24:05] <Neo_papa> I need right send 3 files to server using ajax request ....
[04:24:48] <Cork> Neo_papa: you need to use a FormData object
[04:25:51] <Cork> $.ajax(url, { processData: false, contentType: false, data: new FormData(formElement) })
[04:27:22] <Cork> Neo_papa: async false means it tries to use the old legacy syncronous xhr call menthod, (where the code in the browser stops executing until the network response comes back)
[04:27:29] <Cork> you should NOT use that
[04:27:51] <Cork> also worth mentioning, it is deperecated and removed in 3.x series of jquery
[04:28:04] <Cork> (async: false that is)
[04:43:36] <Neo_papa> Cork, I found it in google , yes I will use it, just interesting is any other way pass data to handler beside using FormData object ?
[04:44:15] <Cork> Neo_papa: data sure, file references, no
[04:44:32] <Neo_papa> Cork, ok, clearly
[04:45:17] <Neo_papa> before was badly , I did not know about this 'async: false' and inventing other way prevent multiple requests , Now will use it :)
[04:45:38] <Neo_papa> Cork, maybe using this 'async' can easy do chat ?
[04:46:03] <Cork> Neo_papa: you can do the same thing without sync calls
[04:46:08] <Neo_papa> what do you think about creating chat using jQuery ?
[04:46:34] <Cork> the only situation where you need sync ajax calls is when you have designed the code wrong and need to be able to return the result from an ajax call
[04:46:53] <Cork> Neo_papa: sure, it would combine it with webrtc or websocket through
[04:47:18] <Neo_papa> Cork, with synk user can send a few request and make copies in database, better use async to prevent it
[04:47:22] <Cork> (webrtc if you don't want a central server, or websocket if you want everything to go a central hub)
[04:47:44] <Cork> Neo_papa: you can't prevent things like that through sync
[04:48:01] <Cork> it is still possible to get multiple things happening at the same time
[04:48:07] <Neo_papa> Cork, I don't understand what it means, I mean chat using jQuery and php, without socets , just use ajax requests
[04:48:37] <Cork> Neo_papa: that is another option, and using the old long poll or rocket solution; sure
[04:48:55] <Cork> it is much more resource intensive and less responsive though
[04:49:13] <Neo_papa> Cork, in front and will timer which will send request to server in 2- 5 seconds and check there new message, return back and insert new massage to DOM
[04:49:37] <Cork> ya, that is rocket, a slow version of it but ya
[04:50:19] <Cork> why websocket is a better option for chat is cause you can push messages to clients then
[04:50:31] <Cork> (same with webrtc)
[04:50:41] <Neo_papa> Cork, resource intensive ? Little request will consuming much resources ? I don't think so , and can use for hosting host on SSD disks
[04:50:58] <Neo_papa> Cork, I don't know what it means 'websocket' ...
[04:51:15] <Cork> no but you will do (new message? no!, new messages?, no!, new messages?, no!=
[04:51:15] <Cork> *)
[04:51:22] <Cork> instead of (here is a new message!)
[04:51:55] <Cork> Neo_papa: it is a different protocol
[04:52:07] <Cork> it gives you a permanent mutexed socked in hs
[04:52:07] <Cork> *js
[04:52:11] <Neo_papa> repeat ? I watched it in one chat ,there always massages repeat a few times :)
[04:52:12] <Cork> so server can push messages out to the client
[04:52:34] <Cork> Neo_papa: i'm not talking about what you see in the interface
[04:52:47] <Cork> about how the information is given from the server to the client
[04:53:04] <Cork> with ajax you have to constantly pull for updates
[04:53:13] <Cork> while with websocket you can just sit there and the server PUSHES updates
[04:53:24] <Neo_papa> Cork, websocket is it librery for js ?
[04:53:27] <Cork> meaning no network traffic or load on either server or client until there is an update
[04:53:33] <Neo_papa> Cork, how I can use it ?
[04:53:34] <Cork> like i said it is a protocol
[04:53:47] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API
[04:54:04] <Cork> there are libs to make it easier to use
[04:54:28] <Cork> donno if there is any for php (don't think so as php doesn't have a constrantly running process)
[04:54:53] <Neo_papa> Cork, but this can not support all main browsers or it support all ?
[04:55:28] <Cork> Neo_papa: it supports ie10+ and all other supported browsers on the market
[04:55:54] <Cork> so if you need ie9 you will need to include a flash (think there might be a silverlight version) for it
[04:55:59] <Neo_papa> Cork, ok, will little read about this, like will have time .
[04:56:40] <Cork> Neo_papa: might want to read this too https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API
[04:56:46] <Neo_papa> Cork, no, don't need IE in common, I need only Firefox and chrome , don't care about others, they don't use much
[04:56:54] <Cork> it is similar to websocket, but peer to peer
[04:57:30] <Neo_papa> Cork, better I read articles how create chat, I have read one and there use only ajax , without websocket
[04:57:33] <Neo_papa> ....
[04:58:46] <Neo_papa> will do my form
[04:59:10] <Neo_papa> need send in form 3 files using ajax , before I did not do this
[04:59:19] <Neo_papa> very difficult :(
[05:00:06] <Neo_papa> and that input file show only in English and look ugly , I read it can't change , can only hide ?
[05:00:49] <Neo_papa> make input[type=file] transparent and put under other element...
[06:37:16] <Ice_Strike> Hi
[06:37:41] <Ice_Strike> This is working version http://jsfiddle.net/xBB5x/14135/ - I am be able to drag heart to white container.
[06:38:06] <Ice_Strike> Why does this does not work http://jsfiddle.net/xBB5x/14134/ - heart does not appear on white container when using using bootstrap framework
[06:40:19] <Woet> Ice_Strike: how is that a jquery question?
[06:40:47] <Ice_Strike> because draggable is part of jquery
[06:42:38] <Woet> Ice_Strike: what does your problem have to do with draggable?
[06:42:46] <Ice_Strike> k...
[06:42:56] <Woet> neither works for me on chrome, just so you know
[06:43:03] <Ice_Strike> work for me
[06:43:14] <Ice_Strike> It is not drag and drop
[06:43:17] <Ice_Strike> just drag.
[06:44:35] <Woet> oh, okay
[06:44:36] <Woet> dunno then
[08:57:35] <coderhut> Hi, I am stuck with ajax causing double insertion into database using PHP and this is happening only on iphone chrome and safari etc but not on desktop OS. Has anyone experienced this before?
[09:00:01] <coderhut> when I alert the return data it only alerts once. but there are two entries in database always from ios.
[09:00:16] <Cork> coderhut: don't use alert for debugging
[09:00:19] <Cork> it isn't reliable
[09:00:32] <Cork> use console.log()
[09:00:41] <coderhut> I am not sure how to see returned data in iphone
[09:00:45] <Cork> alert doesn't happen in execution order
[09:01:07] <Cork> it is very magical in how browser has to fiddle with it to make legacy code work
[09:01:33] <Cork> i'm not very good with iphone development so can't help you much there
[09:02:39] <coderhut> its working fine everywhere and only iphone browser is causing issue.
[09:04:21] <Cork> i suspect its is cause of there input overlay or something like that
[09:04:32] <Cork> cause those cause events to fire twice in some cases
[09:04:48] <Cork> i doubt it is the network stack or anything low like that
[09:05:10] <Cork> so start by debugging the ui events and make sure it isn't comming from there
[09:07:07] <Proteus`> if you dont want to debug it but only want to fix it, just put your click event function in a timeout of 10 ms or something small and a clearTimeOut
[09:18:58] <mikesrike> 	Hi. I added csrf meta tag in my base layout file line 6 https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ecdf718327341be8260396696f2f1a52 and in ajax config here https://gist.github.com/anonymous/62b7b3d17d9bc0a7cca5297e1746a155 but ajax post requests cause token mismatch. Get works just fine
[09:21:45] <Cork> mikesrike: https://jsfiddle.net/benLvw65/ this should be all you need
[09:22:08] <Cork> (it's a straight copy of what i use)
[09:23:09] <mikesrike> Cork unfortunately it's not working
[09:23:24] <Cork> mikesrike: notice it isn't what you're using
[09:23:38] <Cork> at lest not in the gist
[09:24:01] <mikesrike> Yeah I replaced it with your version, not working
[09:24:25] <Cork> are you updating the tocken when you have contacted the server?
[09:24:49] <Cork> 	if(data.csrf) {
[09:24:49] <Cork> 		$('meta[name="csrf-token"]').attr('content', data.csrf);
[09:24:50] <Cork> 	}
[09:25:04] <Cork> as the csrf changes for each time you contact the server
[09:26:13] <mikesrike> I now included the token directly in my ajax login request, still mismatch
[09:26:27] <Cork> no, no...
[09:26:46] <Cork> when you have contacted the server on the response you need to send the new csrf-tocken
[09:26:54] <Cork> if you don't it will work once but not again
[09:26:57] <Cork> as it changes
[09:27:19] <mikesrike> I completely refresh the site every each try
[09:27:37] <Cork> and you have no ajax calls what so ever before the post?
[09:27:51] <mikesrike> Exactly
[09:28:00] <Cork> donno then
[09:28:13] <mikesrike> I'll show you my entire app.js file
[09:29:14] <mikesrike> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ea3d7805e9c213f31d23b91cfb5d8693
[09:30:17] <Cork> that's without the modifications to ajaxSetup though
[09:30:28] <Cork> (and the $.ajaxPrefilter isn't needed at all)
[09:30:56] <Cork> and the headers section in line 79 shouldn't be there either
[09:31:19] <mikesrike> I know
[09:31:30] <mikesrike> I tried all you just said
[09:32:11] <Cork> tried the correct case of the header?
[09:32:57] <Cork> it's "X-CSRF-Token"
[09:34:38] <mikesrike> It's not according to laravel docs https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/csrf#csrf-x-csrf-token
[09:37:34] <Cork> guess you would have to ask a laravel support forum then, cause that should work
[09:48:10] <mikesrike> They are banging their dicks
[09:53:42] <Proteus`> i'm not sure how that would help development at all.
[09:53:47] <Proteus`> lol
[11:21:46] <cannap> test
[11:39:30] <rickymiller> test
[11:39:50] <AwkwardCough> one two one two
[11:55:34] <poboy> check one two onna microphone...
[11:57:12] <Proteus`> THREE *CRUNCH*
[12:32:01] <rubidious> What might a function call like $.9() mean? I've got a piece of packed javascript which uses this function and it doesn't seem to be defined anywhere?
[12:33:26] <robertmaxrees> looks like something aggressively uglified.  i'd have to see it in context.
[12:34:46] <rubidious> it's in one of those eval(function(p,a,c,k,e,d){})
[12:34:52] <rubidious> so it's definitely been uglified heh
[12:35:02] <robertmaxrees> why do you ask?
[12:35:13] <rubidious> I'm trying to understand how the packing works
[12:35:24] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[12:35:26] <rubidious> or at least how to evaluate the code by myself
[12:35:34] <rubidious> without the aid of some beautifier/minifier
[12:35:39] <rubidious> for learning purposes
[12:35:44] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:35:47] <robertmaxrees> heh.  okay.
[12:35:53] <robertmaxrees> that's a really strange skill to wnat.
[12:35:56] <robertmaxrees> *want
[12:36:41] <rubidious> here's the context: https://pastebin.com/6twF8VSb
[12:36:50] <rubidious> simple to decode using an unpacker
[12:36:58] <robertmaxrees> just use sourcemaps and call it a day.
[12:37:11] <rubidious> sourcemaps?
[12:37:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  are you minifying this code yourself?
[12:37:33] <rubidious> nope
[12:38:07] <robertmaxrees> sometimes people ship the code with source maps enabled.  they let you see the original source instead of the minified version.
[12:38:44] <robertmaxrees> also: http://matthewfl.com/unPacker.html
[12:38:58] <robertmaxrees> that $.9 call was $.ajax
[12:39:26] <rubidious> yes I can see that
[12:39:34] <rubidious> but how could you tell that without using the unpacker?
[12:39:42] <robertmaxrees> why would you want to?
[12:39:57] <rubidious> because I want to understand how the unpacker decided $.9 was $.ajax
[12:41:02] <rubidious> as far as I can tell it's not defined anywhere in the source there, so I thought maybe it was a jquery alias or something similar?
[12:41:05] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/21423538/923919
[12:42:24] <rubidious> maybe I don't understand what you're trying to say, but I don't see anything there that explains why $.9 is interpreted as $.ajax
[12:43:20] <robertmaxrees> basically, basically, function(p, a, c, k, e, d) {}  interprets the string that gets passed and decodes it.
[12:43:48] <robertmaxrees> "Packer does more then just rename vars and arguments, it actually maps the source code using Base62 which then must be rebuilt on the client side via eval() in order to be usable."
[12:44:00] <robertmaxrees> which was in that SO link I gave.
[12:44:21] <taplar> sounds nasty
[12:44:29] <robertmaxrees> it is.
[12:44:33] <robertmaxrees> it's a little overly aggressive.
[12:44:53] <robertmaxrees> rubidious fwiw that output isn't intended to be human-readable.
[12:44:59] <taplar> is packer trying to obscure the logic?
[12:45:22] * taplar came in late to the convo
[12:45:25] <robertmaxrees> it's trying to compress it as much as possible.
[12:45:34] <rubidious> I know it's not intended to be human readable
[12:45:48] <Uhkis> seems rather pointless if it makes the code slower
[12:45:48] <rubidious> my intention is just to be able to decode it without the packer
[12:45:55] <rubidious> unpacker*
[12:46:08] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:46:09] <rubidious> somehow I missed the bas62 comment
[12:46:13] <rubidious> base62*
[12:46:15] <robertmaxrees> heh :)
[12:46:19] <rubidious> thanks for pointing it out :)
[12:47:35] <rubidious> at least now I understand how $.9 can appear undefined
[12:47:45] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:47:47] <rubidious> makes much more sense now that I look at it that way
[12:48:41] <robertmaxrees> this is a great example of "great mental exercize, kind of pointless for practical applications"
[12:49:58] <rubidious> exactly, yes hah
[12:54:34] <rubidious> thanks for your help robertmaxrees, I think I've got a handle on it now :)
[12:54:35] <rubidious> adios
[14:02:04] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeee
[14:02:26] <taplar> heh
[15:49:52] <tables> how can i refresh a div with a page every 5 seconds?
[15:50:39] <taplar> a combination of an ajax call with a setTimeout in the success method
[15:51:39] <taplar> or the div could contain an iframe that refreshes itself
[15:52:12] <tables> i can't use iframe
[15:52:33] <taplar> ok, so then the first option
[15:52:38] <tables> can you show me an example syntax with ajax?
[15:53:47] <robertmaxrees> tables what about that description was confusing?
[15:53:49] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:54:16] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/oqcvzyp9/
[16:01:57] <tables> https://jsfiddle.net/oqcvzyp9/1/  <-- how do i get it to work?
[16:01:59] <tables> taplar, ^
[16:02:18] <taplar> what is confusing you?
[16:02:51] <tables> is my div correct?
[16:02:58] <tables> div id="reloadMyDiv"
[16:03:08] <taplar> sure?
[16:03:19] <taplar> it's valid html markup
[16:03:36] <tables> how come yahoo.com isn't refreshing?
[16:03:49] <robertmaxrees> tables you'll have to figure out the rest yourself.
[16:03:55] <robertmaxrees> also: yahoo probably doesn't allow cors.
[16:04:07] <taplar> i'd suggest going through the learn.jquery.com site for more information
[16:04:12] <robertmaxrees> all that code does is make an ajax call - it doesn't do anything else with it.
[16:17:07] <robertmaxrees> so glad today is friday
[16:17:32] <taplar> yeah.  i really felt like yesterday should have been friday
[16:17:53] <robertmaxrees> word.  i played a show last night and i am just dragging.
[16:17:58] <tables_> https://jsfiddle.net/oqcvzyp9/2/  <-- not working still
[16:18:04] <tables_> er oopos
[16:18:11] <tables_> https://jsfiddle.net/oqcvzyp9/3/
[16:18:14] <tables_> i meant that
[16:18:22] <robertmaxrees> tables_ so
[16:18:24] <tables_> anyone know a site that doesn't have COS?
[16:18:41] <robertmaxrees> you're not doing anything with the ajax call.
[16:18:50] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[16:18:54] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:19:23] <taplar> the code i gave you is incomplete.  it's just a base line.  you need to understand how it works to make it work for you
[16:19:29] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:20:16] <robertmaxrees> tables_ you realize that code doesn't actually update the div on its own, right?
[16:22:06] <tables_> no
[16:22:16] <tables_> how do you update the div?
[16:22:30] <taplar> you need to go through the learn.jquery.com site
[16:22:41] <taplar> you are asking some pretty basic questions that it explains in great detail
[16:27:40] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:32:20] <fiord> hey all
[16:32:32] <robertmaxrees> hello
[16:40:37] <taplar> bonjour
[17:31:58] <Paulpoco> Hi.  Does Chrome 59 affect jQuery?
[17:32:46] <Paulpoco> I not sure why but my rss
[17:33:06] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:33:16] <robertmaxrees> "affect jQuery" how?
[17:33:58] <Paulpoco> Raspberry pi project is using jquery-1.10.2.min.js
[17:35:11] <Paulpoco> Not sure why it is using such an old version
[17:35:22] <robertmaxrees> 1.10 isn't terribly old.
[17:35:26] <robertmaxrees> but what's the issue you're having?
[17:40:33] <Paulpoco> I have a raspberry pi that serves a video and some data and button.  Chrome 58 it works fine, Chrome 59 the button is missing and the data too
[17:40:53] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[17:41:33] <Paulpoco> It might not be jquery
[17:41:51] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) i haven't heard of any issues but that doesn't mean they don't exist.
[17:42:00] <Paulpoco> None that can see
[17:42:07] <robertmaxrees> can you share the code?
[17:44:47] <Paulpoco_> https://github.com/paulpoco/Raspi2GarageOpenerVideo/tree/master/var/www
[17:45:00] <Paulpoco_> My tab got closed
[17:45:16] <robertmaxrees> heh i just needed https://github.com/paulpoco/Raspi2GarageOpenerVideo/blob/master/var/www/js/script.js
[17:45:45] <Paulpoco_> It was chrome 58 works and chrome 59 doesn't.
[17:45:50] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:46:39] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you view source on the page in your browser?
[17:47:03] <robertmaxrees> can you copy/paste that into a bpaste or gist or something?
[17:48:00] <Paulpoco_> Ok, I would have to upgrade to chrome 59 on Android again
[17:48:12] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:48:17] <robertmaxrees> yopu can use a desktop browser to do it.
[17:48:19] <Paulpoco_> Wait
[17:48:28] <taplar> your main page markup is funky, btw
[17:48:52] <robertmaxrees> ^ that's what I was going to get at.
[17:49:03] <taplar> you got a div block and script block outside, and before, your head and body tags
[17:49:06] <robertmaxrees> you've got data outside of <head> and <body>
[17:49:16] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:49:21] <robertmaxrees> also missing a doctype
[17:50:24] <taplar> also i would highly suggest separating the php logic from your markup
[17:50:29] <Paulpoco__> There is no source viewing on chrome android
[17:50:39] <robertmaxrees> Paulpoco you can do it on your desktop.
[17:50:43] <robertmaxrees> no need for the mobile browser.
[17:50:44] <taplar> your $.get will be returning the markup that you are never using, according to your script file
[17:51:01] <robertmaxrees> taplar my guess is he's just trying to hit an endpoint.
[17:51:12] <taplar> yeah, but he's hitting himself
[17:51:13] <robertmaxrees> since that touch probably kicks off stuff on the pi
[17:51:31] <taplar> . /?trigger=1
[17:51:39] <robertmaxrees> he said it was working pre chrome 59
[17:51:52] <taplar> i'm not saying it wouldn't work.  but it's doing more work than it needs to
[17:51:56] <robertmaxrees> oh sure.
[17:52:11] <Paulpoco__> It works on desktop chrome 59 just not on Android
[17:52:32] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[17:52:45] <robertmaxrees> Paulpoco_ sure.  still would like to see the rendered markup.
[17:53:04] <Paulpoco__> And I could install a source viewer but that might not behave the same as chrome 59 android
[17:53:06] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't look like you're doing device detection server-side so it's the same markup to both devices.
[17:53:29] <robertmaxrees> just right click and hit "view page source"
[17:53:34] <robertmaxrees> literally all you need to do :)
[17:53:45] <robertmaxrees> then pop that into a gist or bpaste or something./
[17:56:05] <taplar> you know, i wonder about the security of things like this
[17:56:14] <taplar> are people putting them behind a firewall of some sort?
[17:56:40] <taplar> or are they just relying on the endpoints being obscure
[17:56:47] <robertmaxrees> security through obscurity./
[17:56:52] <taplar> :(
[17:56:58] <robertmaxrees> gotta know the IP and what you're looking for.
[17:57:23] <robertmaxrees> cases like this it's probably not a huge deal.  router admin interfaces that don't disable CORS, on the other hand...
[17:58:14] <robertmaxrees> Paulpoco__ were you able to get the page source?
[17:58:16] <taplar> i'm just thinking about the massive amounts of fishing pings that get sent out searching ips for open ports and such.  i wouldn't think it'd take very long for someone in china to find this
[17:58:57] <taplar> another fun thing to think about on a friday, :D
[17:59:00] <robertmaxrees> sure - but why would they care?
[17:59:09] <taplar> they could open my garage?
[17:59:15] <taplar> lol
[17:59:30] <robertmaxrees> heh i can open pretty much any garage without a garage door opener.
[17:59:34] <robertmaxrees> it's not hard to do.
[18:01:07] * taplar dances
[18:01:12] <Paulpoco__> https://gist.github.com/paulpoco/10a33cabe323c52587042a05fa6f69e6
[18:01:38] <robertmaxrees> PaulCapestany yeah, so the first thing to fix is to get that serverData div and script tag into a valid spot on the page./
[18:02:30] <robertmaxrees> also: you can do remote debugging on android devices pretty easily with chrome.  though installing drivers can bne kind of a pain
[18:03:28] <Paulpoco__> Or just roll back to chrome 58 Android until I have time to make the site work
[18:03:38] <robertmaxrees> you don't have time now?
[18:03:53] <Paulpoco__> No
[18:04:00] <taplar> it's pretty much a cut/paste job for fixing the div and script parts
[18:04:21] <robertmaxrees> also: jquery isn't the issue if the page simply isn't showing anything.
[18:04:30] <robertmaxrees> more than likely, at least.
[18:05:09] <Paulpoco__> The page is showing my video from the raspi cam and a line if text and the case
[18:05:31] <Paulpoco__> CSS style and the trigger button are missing
[18:05:36] <robertmaxrees> "Chrome 58 it works
[18:05:36] <robertmaxrees> fine, Chrome 59 the button is missing and the data too
[18:05:55] <robertmaxrees> i'd check the network tab then and see if you're getting 404s on those.
[18:05:59] <Paulpoco__> Chrome 58 on Android it works
[18:06:18] <robertmaxrees> we've established that ;)
[18:06:20] <robertmaxrees> *:)
[18:07:51] <Paulpoco__> Gotta go to dentist, try later, thanks
[18:08:05] <robertmaxrees> aight.
[18:08:57] <taplar> i wonder how that event source works
[18:09:33] <taplar> https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/chrome-59-deprecations    looks like some beacons are now CORS restricted
[18:10:11] <robertmaxrees> woudl that explain why the css isn't working?
[18:10:29] <robertmaxrees> 'cause it sounds like that's the issue.
[18:10:29] <taplar> wouldn't see how it could
[18:12:49] <taplar> any plans for the weekend?
[18:13:21] <robertmaxrees> might go to a shindig a friend is throwing for their daughter's 1st birthday.  otherwise, just gotta do a little yard work and relax.
[18:13:23] <robertmaxrees> yourself?
[18:13:56] <taplar> just laze around the house.  nothing big
[18:16:13] <taplar> should probably go window shop an IPS if I get a wild hair
[18:16:28] <robertmaxrees> ooh
[18:16:43] <robertmaxrees> i'm itching to buy 2 more of the 24" ultrasharps I've got.
[18:16:55] <taplar> err, sorry, not IPS, UPS
[18:17:21] <taplar> heh, i'm good with my 32" for a long long time, ^_^
[18:17:45] <robertmaxrees> oooh hahaha
[18:18:13] <taplar> how many do you have now?  going for the 4 screen setup?
[18:18:53] <robertmaxrees> i've just got a single 24, then an older 22" lg tn and a 22" lg ips.
[18:19:03] <robertmaxrees> but the tn is a 16:10 and the ips is a 16:9
[18:19:37] <taplar> the ips is the one that's supossed to have better color variations, right?
[18:20:07] <taplar> color contrast
[18:20:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah, slower response times, better color.
[18:20:42] <taplar> i have to say, mine is an ips and maybe i'm not playing the colorful games or what not, but I really don't notice a difference from my old tn
[18:20:54] <taplar> i should probably put them up side by side to compare
[18:21:14] <robertmaxrees> there's a difference, but you're just not gonna notice it in some cases
[18:22:20] <taplar> i will say though, in regards to the large screens.  mine at least seems to get confused if you are not using all of it's resolution
[18:22:47] <taplar> like i mainly stay in the 2k range, but if I have like a game or video like windowed in it, it's not uncommon that the colors will go to crap
[18:22:50] <robertmaxrees> you mean not giving it a native resolution source?
[18:22:54] <taplar> full view is fine though
[18:23:06] <robertmaxrees> that's likely an issue with your video card settings.
[18:23:13] <taplar> hmm
[18:23:20] <robertmaxrees> got an nvidia card?
[18:23:36] <taplar> ya, doing the whole gsync thing
[18:24:04] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/XdagKLo.png double check these
[18:24:23] <robertmaxrees> and check that whatever is play video is setup right.
[18:24:53] <taplar> k, sweet, i'll check that when i get home
[18:45:00] <tables_> https://jsfiddle.net/oqcvzyp9/4/  <-- can someone fix my syntax for me?  i'm trying to refresh the div every 5 seconds
[18:45:12] <tables_> this code is not working
[18:45:24] <taplar> gone through the learn.jquery.com site yet?
[18:46:53] <tables_> where should i look?
[18:46:59] <tables_> i dunno if i wanna just learn jquery
[18:47:02] <tables_> i need something fast
[18:47:08] <taplar> that's not the point of this room
[18:47:11] <taplar> this is a teaching room
[18:47:27] <taplar> if you are looking for someone to make something for you, this isn't the place
[18:47:31] <tables_> you can't fix the syntax for me?
[18:47:36] <taplar> oh sure
[18:47:46] <taplar> but again, my last three statements
[18:47:47] <tables_> or make it work
[18:48:11] <tables_> ok first of all
[18:48:25] <tables_> is function reloadMyDiv() going to start right away?
[18:48:29] <tables_> and work on any div?
[18:48:42] <taplar> no.  it's a function.  functions are not executed by default
[18:48:47] <tables_> what makes it work on any div?
[18:48:58] <taplar> nothing
[18:49:00] <tables_> ok so do i have to execute it by default?
[18:49:06] <taplar> you have to write it so it works on what you want it to
[18:49:16] <taplar> yes, you have to execute the method
[18:50:59] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/  <-- great place to start
[18:51:02] <tables_> how do i do that?
[18:51:55] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions
[18:52:09] <robertmaxrees> tables_ you're not sure how to run a function
[18:55:08] <robertmaxrees> tables_ ^^^
[18:57:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:57:43] <tables_> function ()
[18:57:44] <tables_> {
[18:57:44] <tables_> $('#load').load('refreshtest.html').fadeIn("slow");
[18:57:44] <tables_> }, 10000); // refresh every 10000 milliseconds
[18:57:47] <robertmaxrees> yo.
[18:57:56] <robertmaxrees> don't paste in the channel.
[18:57:56] <tables_> how do i make the page start with the div load on refreshtest.html?
[18:58:02] <tables_> i got it
[18:58:07] <tables_> that script is working, the one i just pasted
[18:58:12] <robertmaxrees> use a service.
[18:58:16] <robertmaxrees> not in the channel, yo.
[18:58:39] <tables_> ok 1 sec
[18:59:42] <tables_> https://paste2.org/4p8WtOyD   <-- how do i make this load start with refreshtest.html?
[19:00:02] <robertmaxrees> really?showed
[19:00:05] <tables_> the div has to load refreshtest.html for starters
[19:00:12] <tables_> it shows blank then 10 seconds later it refreshes
[19:00:17] <robertmaxrees> l;ol
[19:00:24] <robertmaxrees> 1st: don't use setinterval.
[19:01:01] <robertmaxrees> 2nd: just pull the load out into its own function that you call on pageload.
[19:04:44] <robertmaxrees> taplar gave you a solution to this. not sure why you're suddenly ignoring that advice.
[19:12:34] <tables_> https://paste2.org/cEKjkEMs  <-- i tried this load and it's not working
[19:12:54] <robertmaxrees> because that code doesn't make any sense.
[19:13:12] <robertmaxrees> setting the source for a div doesn't pull in anything.
[19:13:12] <tables_> what's wrong with it?
[19:13:40] <robertmaxrees> <div src="somepage.html"></div>
[19:13:44] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't work.
[19:13:56] <robertmaxrees> why are you ignoring the advice we gave you?
[19:18:26] <latemus> what the hell
[19:18:35] <robertmaxrees>  ?
[19:18:51] <latemus> oops wrong window
[19:18:57] <latemus> thanks robertmaxrees
[19:19:07] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[19:58:03] <tables_> https://paste2.org/cEKjkEMs <-- how do i load refreshtest.html in my div at start?
[19:58:18] <tables_> it loads only 10 seconds later after start
[20:11:49] <neilpdx> tables, don't put it into the load event then
[20:12:13] <neilpdx> put it into ready()
[20:31:19] <neilpdx> a nice way to send you off for the weekend right here https://vid.me/ZcpW
