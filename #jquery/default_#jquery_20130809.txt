[00:00:08] <doug65536> my latest one?
[00:00:13] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/gaEzu/4/
[00:00:50] <nesoi> ah, that's good
[00:01:00] <nesoi> the idea is that if you just have item one it is at the bottom
[00:01:16] <nesoi> so that the first entry is always directly above the textarea, which is itself just above the fixed footer
[00:01:22] <doug65536> nesoi: and you take care of the rest, ok
[00:01:39] <doug65536> so you do something like calculating how many can fit then show that many?
[00:01:56] <nesoi> jquery.scrollz does that
[00:02:22] <doug65536> nesoi: so that's what you needed?
[00:02:24] <nesoi> I tell it how big an area it should scroll, it makes that area, then I load more when the user scrolls down  (or up)
[00:02:36] <nesoi> that's what I needed if it would actually work with jqm listviews
[00:02:39] <doug65536> (automated height)
[00:02:43] <doug65536> ok...
[00:02:51] <nesoi> but when I apply the style to the listview, it does nothing
[00:02:56] <kinder> how can I call a click event when an option in <select> is clicked?
[00:03:39] <lenswipee> kinder: i think you do $('select').click(function(){});
[00:03:40] <doug65536> kinder: you probably want .on('change'
[00:04:07] <doug65536> kinder: is it multiselect and you want interactive updates?
[00:04:20] <EvilNo0B> Hey guys , im not sure what i should call it and search for it but what i want is basically slide down content on click , BUT it should not change the url , and for example if after that code i have links like that again ( basically copy&paste , well the php script will generate same script with different data ) . Any ideas what i am looking for so i could google it ?
[00:04:25] <nesoi> doug65536 : so, any idea how to get this to work with a jquery mobile listview?
[00:04:26] <kinder> yes doug
[00:04:28] <kinder> something like it
[00:04:43] <doug65536> kinder: then what lenswipee said is probably what you want
[00:05:01] <doug65536> nesoi: let me try it
[00:05:29] <nesoi> thanks doug65536!
[00:05:47] <kinder> doug65536: except for the fact that I need change and not click.
[00:05:51] <kinder> click does not work :p
[00:06:35] <doug65536> kinder: try 'change'
[00:07:07] <kinder> I am using change
[00:07:39] <doug65536> $( "select option:selected" ).each(function() {  $(this).text() (or val or attr id etc) }) to iterate over selected items
[00:07:40] <kinder> focusout or blur?
[00:08:03] <doug65536> kinder: are you sure there isn't an error happening that is causing the real problem?
[00:08:13] <kinder> what problem? :o
[00:08:16] <kinder> it works splendid
[00:08:32] <doug65536> lol ok then
[00:09:55] <Whirl3d> I would like to know how to get the reference elment used for .position();    In other words, if I have <div><p><a></a></p></div>    and I get $("div p a').position(); will it be relative to the paragraph or to the div and how can I find that out programmatically
[00:10:26] <doug65536> Whirl3d: my guess: .parent().css("position")
[00:11:28] <doug65536> Whirl3d: get parent().position and calculate offset from there? not sure why you need that
[00:12:42] <Whirl3d> $.fn.positionSource=function () {return this.parents().filter(function () {if ($(this).css("position')=="absolute") return true; return false});});
[00:22:31] <kinder> How can I remove the selected option? I tried this with no luck $('select', this).remove();
[00:23:35] <doug65536> nesoi: http://jsfiddle.net/gaEzu/12/ is that what you need?
[00:23:38] <doug65536> or is that wrong
[00:24:39] <Whirl3d> http://jsbin.com/ugusah/1/edit
[00:25:00] <nesoi> doug65536 : that one doesn't work for me... the items appear below the box!
[00:25:17] <doug65536> nesoi: works in chrome. which browser are you using
[00:25:27] <doug65536> nesoi: what box?
[00:25:36] <doug65536> pink?
[00:28:37] <nesoi> yes
[00:28:51] <nesoi> in chrome I see the pink box above all the items
[00:29:02] <doug65536> nesoi: ok, so don't make it a pink background
[00:29:14] <doug65536> nesoi: not sure I see what the problem is
[00:29:38] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/gaEzu/24/
[00:29:53] <nesoi> doug65536 : the pink background appears above all the items. the items are below it
[00:30:03] <nesoi> the pink represents the scrolling area, so the items are off the screen, no?
[00:30:18] <doug65536> nesoi: they're on my screen
[00:30:22] <nesoi> ah ok
[00:30:28] <nesoi> they filled up the area
[00:30:39] <doug65536> theyre at the bottom as intented
[00:30:41] <nesoi> yes, that would be good. if it worked in a jqm listview
[00:30:45] <doug65536> intended*
[00:30:51] <doug65536> it is a listview
[00:30:53] <doug65536> look
[00:31:31] <nesoi> it's a jquery listview... will that work in a jqm listview?
[00:31:42] <doug65536> jqm is loaded, look closer
[00:32:45] <doug65536> do I not load jq normal and jqm?
[00:33:07] <nesoi> I don't see jqm loaded.
[00:33:16] <doug65536> click external resources
[00:33:31] <nesoi> ah right
[00:33:33] <nesoi> I see it
[00:33:34] <nesoi> cool
[00:33:54] <nesoi> it has to format the listview though, not the page
[00:33:59] <nesoi> because there's going to be something below it
[00:34:42] <nesoi> and if I apply it to the listview, it doesn't work.
[00:35:08] <doug65536> apply what
[00:35:11] <nesoi> the style
[00:35:23] <doug65536> what style
[00:35:38] <nesoi> http://jsfiddle.net/gaEzu/31/
[00:35:48] <nesoi> oh wait
[00:35:50] <nesoi> I missed it
[00:36:02] <nesoi> right
[00:36:03] <nesoi> thanks
[00:36:06] <nesoi> let's try it
[00:36:11] <doug65536> :)
[00:38:16] <kinder> ok guys... so how do I do this? Send all option values in a select to a php script.
[00:38:32] <kinder> my idea is to store them as an array and then send that array to php
[00:38:36] <doug65536> kinder: make the name end with [] I think
[00:38:57] <kinder> make the name end with [] doesn't say much
[00:39:01] <kinder> :p
[00:39:06] <doug65536> it says a lot
[00:39:16] <doug65536> <select name="dude[]" ...
[00:39:30] <kinder> why?
[00:40:27] <doug65536> kinder: so it works?
[00:40:43] <kinder> I dont even know what it is
[00:40:47] <kinder> or why
[00:41:08] <doug65536> kinder: you don't need to do it manually
[00:41:19] <kinder> do what manually? :p
[00:41:33] <doug65536> you forgot already?
[00:41:37] <doug65536> <kinder> ok guys... so how do I do this? Send all option values in a select to a php script.
[00:42:04] <kinder> I dont see how adding [] to the name would send it to PHP :p thats why am asking what it is.
[00:42:32] <doug65536> you're asking a stupid question that I already answered.
[00:42:38] <doug65536> you add that SO IT WORKS
[00:42:43] <nesoi> doug65536 : when I try it on android it's not working :(
[00:42:58] <kinder> what does []do?
[00:43:32] <doug65536> <kinder> ok guys... so how do I do this? Send all option values in a select to a php script.
[00:44:01] <kinder> so adding [] to the name it will send all option values to php
[00:44:06] <doug65536> yes
[00:44:23] <kinder> you sure?
[00:44:27] <nesoi> I defined it rather than ul, which I need to work normally in other places as .reverse, then I added class="reverse" to the listview and it doesn't display on the bottom in android. Instead, the listview is partly off the screen on top and the messages are still not at the bottom
[00:44:51] <doug65536> kinder: no
[00:44:56] <kinder> doug65536: var dump returns null on $_POST['selectMail']
[00:45:09] <doug65536> var dump $_POST
[00:45:41] <kinder> want me to dump $_POST? That will also be null because no POST has been specified
[00:46:00] <doug65536> kinder: you're joking right?
[00:46:30] <doug65536> if it's not a post form, why would $_POST['selectMail'] work?
[00:47:25] <kinder> it is a post form
[00:48:34] <doug65536> kinder: I'm not going to keep repeating myself. good luck
[00:50:23] <kinder> Am just saying that select will always be a post. If you disagree you'll have to take it up with the php community.
[00:50:53] <doug65536> kinder: forms existed years before php even existed
[00:51:11] <kinder> am using php to process it aint I?
[00:51:16] <kinder> all else is irrelevant
[00:51:32] <doug65536> idiot
[00:55:00] <gonnarule> hi peeps
[00:55:58] <doug65536> hi
[01:04:43] <nesoi> doug65536 : so I'm inspecting the elements of the android app as they are actually displayed, and it looks like <div data-role='content'><div class="scrollz-container reverse"><div class="scrolls-content-wrapper"><div [the actual container with height and width]><ul>
[01:05:05] <nesoi> so the 'reverse' style which we defined is being applied to that div just below content
[01:05:10] <nesoi> and somehow is not affecting the actual ul
[01:05:18] <nesoi> when I put it on the ul, it doesn't do anything
[01:05:49] <doug65536> my fiddle used direct id styling (#), you updated those to . and class names appropriately right?
[01:06:41] <nesoi> yes, and I tried telling the jquery.scrollz to add that style to the container, which it sort of did. I can see it there. That doesn't work. I also tried putting the style directly on the container and directly on the ul, and that didn't work either
[01:07:03] <doug65536> maybe !important is needed on something?
[01:07:28] <nesoi> I tried it before with !important on everything and it didn't change anything
[01:27:20] <nesoi> doug65536 : thanks for your help!
[01:27:26] <doug65536> nesoi: np
[01:29:56] <Ulrar> Hi, is there a way to disable a submit button but keep the push thing and onClick event ? I'd like to put a button in a form that would just call a function
[01:33:16] <doug65536> Ulrar: yes, call ev.preventDefault() in your submit handler
[01:33:26] <doug65536> where ev is the parameter in the callback function
[01:33:55] <Ulrar> doug65536: You mean in the function called by the onClick() ?
[01:34:16] <doug65536> no, make it a submit button...
[01:34:39] <doug65536> and attach the event to the form .on('submit', function(ev) { ev.preventDefault(); ...etc... });
[01:35:17] <Ulrar> Ho, okay
[01:35:19] <Ulrar> Thanks
[01:35:20] <doug65536> Ulrar: I assume you are going to ajax post the serialized values or something?
[01:35:31] <Ulrar> doug65536: yes
[01:40:23] <b0nn> hi all, I have some faux xml in a string that looks like "<A1>1</A1><A2>3</A2><A3>2</A2>..." and I want to know how do I fish out the value between (say) <A1> and </A1>?
[01:40:37] <b0nn> the string is returned from my server
[01:46:02] <Ulrar> doug65536: I am supposed to do that on the form itself ?
[01:47:10] <doug65536> yes, attach to 'submit' event on the form
[01:47:22] <Cork> b0nn: is the string parsed to a dom?
[01:47:30] <doug65536> Ulrar: the purpose of that technique is to make it possible for the form to work if javascript is disabled
[01:48:19] <Ulrar> doug65536: is there a way to do that on only one submit button ?
[01:48:37] <Ulrar> I'd like the other submit to work
[01:49:00] <doug65536> Ulrar: yes, put an id on the form and do $('#some_form_id').on('submit' ...
[01:49:43] <Ulrar> doug65536: yeah but that will call it for all submit
[01:49:58] <Ulrar> I want to call my function only on a specific button
[01:50:11] <doug65536> oh not a submit button?
[01:50:18] <doug65536> I thought you said submit button
[01:50:36] <Ulrar> There is button of others type ?
[01:50:43] <Ulrar> Not realy used to do html my self, sorry
[01:51:04] <doug65536> Ulrar: yes, a submit button submits the form, a button is just a button
[01:51:10] <doug65536> Ulrar: making fiddle for you...
[01:56:43] <uuno> is this working?
[01:57:12] <uuno> wow, is this like last channel which doesn't require registration
[01:58:09] <uuno> what is this registration nazism boom anyway
[01:58:13] <Ulrar> uuno: We can see what you say, if that's the question
[01:58:51] <uuno> yes, and thats good, damn to all these registrations
[01:59:19] <uuno> well my q is javascript but that channel has turned into reg only
[02:00:03] <uuno> i wonder if it is quicker to compare strings than dates?
[02:00:32] <Ulrar> doug65536: Never knew there was a <button> balise, thanks a lot
[02:00:45] <doug65536> Ulrar: http://jsfiddle.net/k6tr4/8/
[02:01:47] <doug65536> Ulrar: it's setup to get a json response, assuming you return one, else remove parameter on line 11
[02:03:01] <Ulrar> doug65536: got it working, thanks a lot !
[02:03:07] <doug65536> Ulrar: np
[02:03:07] <Ulrar> Good to know
[02:10:28] <gonnarule> Could someone say me why my change() isn't triggered ? Thanks : http://pastebin.com/ev2KV7Bk
[02:11:16] <phiz> http://jsfiddle.net/
[02:20:33] <gonnarule> http://jsfiddle.net/CgPR7/
[02:20:40] <gonnarule> jquery change() problem : http://jsfiddle.net/CgPR7/
[02:21:07] <gonnarule> when you enter text in the textarea, it should write something... but nothing happens
[02:23:10] <MelkorNemesis> what language the fuck is that?
[02:23:21] <MelkorNemesis> looks like Spanish
[02:24:35] <seutje> it's french
[02:24:51] <MelkorNemesis> ah, you're right
[02:24:59] <gonnarule> btw you don't care the language involved... it's javascript and html.
[02:25:00] <xec> gonnarule: change only fires after it loses focus
[02:25:06] <seutje> you just royally messed up 2 of the world's main languages
[02:25:20] <seutje> gonnarule: put the shit within the document ready, it's not catching the elements for me
[02:25:32] <gonnarule> xec : still, you can see it's not working even with loosing focus
[02:25:56] <MelkorNemesis> seutje: I find French, Finnish and Czech three most fucked up language in the Europe - Czech is mine B-)
[02:26:05] <MelkorNemesis> languages
[02:26:08] <seutje> gonnarule: http://jsfiddle.net/CgPR7/1/ seems to work
[02:26:23] <seutje> although it's counting up and telling me those are the remaining characters ;P
[02:26:41] <gonnarule> seutje : I thought the events could be set outside the ready shit ?
[02:27:05] <seutje> MelkorNemesis: french is really close to latin, czech has some recognizable parts, but finnish is like hungarian, doesn't look like anything to me
[02:27:23] <gonnarule> seutje : thanks, so all event listeners inside the ready ?
[02:27:25] <seutje> gonnarule: if the selector doesn't match anything, it won't be bound to anything
[02:27:51] <seutje> it's weird though, cause I thought jsfiddle put all the javamascripts in a window.load function
[02:28:09] <MelkorNemesis> but I am proud to live in a country, where the word Robot was invented B-)
[02:28:18] <xec> gonnarule: you need to select inside doc ready (or end of body)
[02:28:24] <seutje> also, you should probably use .on() and not repeat the same selector 17 times
[02:28:36] <gonnarule> seutje : damn, it's wierd because all my events are always outside the document.ready...
[02:28:52] <seutje> if it's at the bottom of the page, it shouldn't matter
[02:29:02] <gonnarule> xec : don't know the .on(), looking at it
[02:29:05] <seutje> when in doubt, console.log($('selector').length)
[02:29:29] <xec> gonnarule: 0
[02:29:32] <xec> oops
[02:29:33] <seutje> if it's 0, it didn't find any elements matching that selector at that point in time
[02:29:41] <xec> gonnarule: http://jsfiddle.net/CgPR7/2/
[02:29:47] <xec> what seutje said
[02:30:41] <gonnarule> well thanks all, gonna put some .on() and put them inside the ready
[02:40:18] <soee> hi, $('#list').html($(data).find('#list')); this - after ajax call - will put into <select id="list"> again <select id="list"> but i would like to put there only list options, how can i do this ?
[02:51:33] <gonnarule> soee : yes, because you're putting #list in #list
[02:52:22] <soee> gonnarule, already fixed it by using: $('#list').html($(data).find('#list').first().html())
[03:11:43] <ernesto_> hi! easy one.. but still hard to me: any ideas how can i hide the white logo during the jquery transition here..? http://aieef.org/drupal722
[03:33:47] <zennit> hi
[03:33:59] <xec> ernesto_: can you be more specific? what logo, what transition?
[03:34:34] <zennit> anyone got any good examples of qunit and mousemove?
[03:36:32] <ernesto_> xec: sorry, i was moving the white logo i mentioned iand probably you could not see what i meant: now it is back there: there is a white logo with sort of arrows and then a transition with images in the header
[03:37:24] <ernesto_> xec: when there is a transition from one image to the next the white logo hidden part appears
[03:37:34] <xec> and you want to hide the top part of the logo to always be hidden?
[03:37:45] <ernesto_> thats it
[03:39:23] <xec> ernesto_: i'd just give the top box (containing the slider) a blue background
[03:39:46] <xec> so that when the images fade out, they fade to blue instead of transparent
[03:40:59] <xec> where does the blue color on the top part come from btw?
[03:43:30] <ernesto_> done! that was just it
[03:58:16] <Christer> Hi all, Im running in to a issue that for me is strange - http://pastebin.com/UwLgE7N0
[03:58:38] <Christer> When resizing, it changes the "top" position to +41 of what it was when starting to resize
[03:58:40] <Christer> so it jumps
[04:04:56] <xec> Christer: could you make a live demo that shows the issue?
[04:05:32] <sammich> do you need the !important when it's inline?
[04:07:24] <guspollos> !important is for overriding previous css
[04:07:24] <b-ot> guspollos: memorised “important”.
[04:07:33] <xec> lol
[04:07:42] <guspollos> it has nothing to do with inline or block
[04:08:13] <sammich> inline is pretty much the highest law of the CSS-land
[04:09:32] <xec> you can have inline !important too
[04:09:46] <xec> which makes sure it's not overriden by external !important
[04:10:10] <xec> it's also a good sign of "doing it wrong"
[04:10:27] <sammich> pretty much my sentiment
[04:10:47] <sammich> was just wondering, if all !important declarations have the same level
[04:11:02] <sammich> or if they are still based on their original rule 'ranking'
[04:11:18] <xec> no, two rules with important have the same rules as if neither did
[04:11:36] <xec> (while overriding anything without important)
[04:11:56] <sammich> sorry, can you rephrase that?
[04:11:58] <xec> two *conflicting* rules, i should say
[04:12:25] <sammich> ah yeah
[04:12:39] <sammich> so if I'm getting you, all !important rules are equivalent
[04:13:00] <Christer> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/akCWY/1/
[04:13:11] <xec> no, they are evaluated using the same rules as any other css
[04:13:26] <sammich> yeah, so pretty much what I guessed
[04:13:38] <sammich> but yours is clearer
[04:14:04] <xec> the top of the hierarchy is inline with important, nothing can override that
[04:14:05] <Christer> The reason why im using !important is because jQuery puts position: absolute, on the element when resizing. so need to override that.
[04:14:39] <Tomashe> will that work : $("input[name='checkbox[]']:checked").each(function(e){	alert(e.attr("url"));		});
[04:14:51] <xec> Christer: no, you can only have one inline value for a given property
[04:15:25] <xec> Christer: setting position to "relative" will at the same time remove whatever inline value it had, if any
[04:16:11] <xec> Christer: meaning, if there is no !important in the external css, there is no need for it in the inline style
[04:16:16] <tango> beside the 'important' discussion..!important in the 'stop:' part will fix your issue for now :)
[04:16:17] <sammich> Tomashe: it'll be an expensive query
[04:16:52] <sammich> also, it's e.target to get the element
[04:17:27] <Christer> oh wait, it might be because draggable is enabled as well, so when dragging in the corner it first pulls off the draggable event.
[04:17:50] <Christer> or, not first, but it doesnt prevent it.
[04:18:04] <Tomashe> what are suggesting then?
[04:18:33] <Tomashe> and why u called it "expensive?
[04:19:26] <Christer> tango, Thank you :)
[04:19:54] <xec> Christer: i think it's the margin on body causing it
[04:20:39] <xec> Christer: http://jsfiddle.net/akCWY/3/ or better, http://jsfiddle.net/akCWY/2/
[04:20:55] <xec> (the /2/ is just including normalize)
[04:23:25] <Christer> xec, when doing it like that it doesnt keep the relative position.
[04:23:46] <xec> sure it does
[04:23:56] <xec> i put the !important in the css, where it belongs ;)
[04:24:02] <Christer> its when adding the start/stop functions that its acting funny
[04:24:04] <Christer> ah
[04:24:18] <sammich> Tomashe: okay, never mind, that'll work. Just fix that e.attr -> e.target.attr
[04:24:20] <sammich> http://jsperf.com/inputchecked-ischecked
[04:24:25] <xec> so, what's the goal of the start/stop functions?
[04:24:30] <sammich> it's the other way around
[04:25:18] <Tomashe> why target?
[04:25:50] <Christer> xec, when resizing the div, jquery puts "position: absolute" on the element.
[04:26:27] <Christer> So the goal was to set the position to relative when user starts to drag the item, so it cant be dragged out of the parent div, and the stop, is to keep the relative position when stopping
[04:26:39] <sammich> Tomashe: Object #<Object> has no method 'attr'
[04:26:49] <Christer> but that doesnt work in your example either =/
[04:27:12] <xec> Christer: can you explain exactly how you want that demo to behave?
[04:27:38] <Tomashe> $("input[name='checkbox[]']:checked") < this find nothing although there are checked :/
[04:27:39] <Tomashe> any ideas?
[04:27:55] <Lightsaber> hi, ı use selectboxIt plugin. My selectbox should seem so: http://gregfranko.com/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/index.html#jQueryUIThemingSupport
[04:27:56] <xec> Tomashe: e is the event object, not an element
[04:27:58] <Lightsaber> But it seems so: http://jsfiddle.net/eVyUc/ How can i fix this problem?
[04:28:31] <xec> Tomashe: we can't tell you why a selector won't work without seeing the html it's supposed to match
[04:28:46] <Tomashe> ncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'attr' of undefined
[04:28:52] <Tomashe> sory it ws wrokign but i get that error
[04:29:01] <Tomashe> although i put target
[04:29:44] <xec> Lightsaber: they look the same to me?
[04:30:55] <Lightsaber> they look different to me because options have strange borders in fiddle
[04:31:37] <sammich> Tomashe: e.target.attr is what you want...
[04:31:51] <sammich> if you want our help, you kinda have to read it
[04:32:25] <xec> Lightsaber: that's the entire issue? the rounded corners in the options?
[04:32:31] <Christer> xec: I was the black box to be movable and resizable inside this #parentDiv -
[04:32:41] <Christer> For some reason i cant get it to work in the fiddle
[04:32:42] <Christer> http://jsfiddle.net/akCWY/4/
[04:33:37] <Tomashe> e.target.attr isnt working but when i put $(this).attr its working perfecty
[04:33:52] <Christer> removed the resizable as thats the one causing problems for me for now, but i can see that in the fiddle, the little div doesnt position relative to the parent. so im not sure whats happening in the fiddle.
[04:34:00] <Christer> as its working on my local
[04:34:14] <Lightsaber> xec: yes
[04:34:18] <sammich> Tomashe: sorry, yeah, I'm mixing my jQuery and JS
[04:34:58] <Christer> xec: like this: http://jsfiddle.net/akCWY/5/
[04:35:22] <Christer> And i want the resize to work as well with this functionality.
[04:35:52] <Christer> But when addign the resizable - It changes position to absolute, which makes it able to get it outside.
[04:36:31] <Whirl3d> Christer, are you trying to restrain the black box to it's parent?
[04:36:36] <Christer> jup
[04:36:38] <Whirl3d> *constrain
[04:37:31] <ernesto_> got this 2 columns (one is called "social", the other "formación" set like width:50% float:left but still the second is not showing aligned.. ( see http://aieef.org/drupal722 )
[04:37:53] <xec> Christer: http://jsfiddle.net/akCWY/7/
[04:38:21] <Christer> xec: WOW
[04:38:29] <Christer> Thanks! Didnt know about that
[04:39:14] <sammich> if in doubt, read the documentation
[04:39:56] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/akCWY/8/
[04:40:10] <Whirl3d> beat me to it. LOL.
[04:40:24] * xec high fives Whirl3d
[04:40:41] * Whirl3d down low
[04:40:56] * xec up top
[04:41:30] <Lightsaber> xec can you help me?
[04:41:52] <ernesto_> sorry guess i used the wrong IRC tab
[04:42:04] <xec> Lightsaber: i'm not sure what's causing the difference, but personally i'd just slap some border radius on it and be done with it
[04:43:15] <tirengarfio> any way to get all the values in a array without using each?
[04:43:36] <xec> tirengarfio: yes, just do alert(myArray.join())
[04:43:49] <xec> alert ALL THE VALUES
[04:44:22] <xec> tirengarfio: what are you *really* trying to do, though? :)
[04:44:27] <Christer> xec: Whirl3d - It still changes position to absolute tho after resizing =/
[04:44:36] <xec> Christer: does it matter?
[04:44:56] <sammich> Array.map, yum
[04:45:26] <Christer> Yes, because the undelaying content could be 2000px x 2000px  - so its a scrollable parent.
[04:46:12] <tirengarfio> I wan to show in a webpage the values in a array, I have used html(array.foo) to get the just one of the values, but  I want to retrieve all
[04:47:01] <xec> Christer: you could do the !important in the css like earlier, but honestly, you usually want draggable/resizable items absolute
[04:47:03] <sammich> tirengarfio: what are the values inside the array? just simple string or number?
[04:47:07] <Whirl3d> I have an anchor element that when clicked, I want to attach an image centered on the link but just above it.  So I want to attach the image with absolute positioning to the ielement by which the link's .position() is measured. How do I figure out that element?
[04:47:24] <tirengarfio> sammich, strings
[04:47:41] <sammich> see what xec wrote above
[04:47:43] <xec> tirengarfio: ".foo" looks like an object key, not an array index...
[04:48:50] <tirengarfio> well, what I recieve from the server is a json string, then I convert it using       var array = $.parseJSON(response); and then I get the values using array.foo
[04:49:16] <xec> Whirl3d: any chance you can make a small demo to play with?
[04:50:11] <xec> tirengarfio: maybe you get a json object instead of a json array then. can you pastebin what "response" contains?
[04:50:47] <xec> just because you named the var "array" doesn't make it an array ;)
[04:51:37] <tirengarfio> http://pastebin.com/9PQLyuyS
[04:51:37] <sammich> Array array = (Array)Object obj
[04:51:47] <Whirl3d> xec, this is a total mess, but here is draft 5849 where I have thrown the book at it. LOL http://jsbin.com/aqubat/1/edit
[04:51:57] <xec> lol
[04:52:58] <sammich> I'd just rewrite something from scratch if I feel a particular implementation is difficult
[04:53:12] <sammich> without referencing the original
[04:54:31] <xec> tirengarfio: yes, that's an object, with two arrays. what are you trying to do with it, specifically?
[04:55:47] <tirengarfio> get the strings (errors from a from) and put them in a div
[04:56:12] <tirengarfio> I know I can use each, but I m wondering if there is any way without using each
[04:57:01] <xec> tirengarfio: http://jsfiddle.net/kkMjd/
[04:57:44] <xec> tirengarfio: if you want to look at all the properties (email and telefono), your best bet is a loop. why do you want to avoid $.each()?
[04:58:23] <tirengarfio> I have any problem with each, I'm just wondering if there was a function in jquery that retrieve all the values
[04:58:39] <tirengarfio> dont have*
[05:00:58] <sammich> well, you do have all the values, it's in 'response' ;)
[05:01:34] <xec> tirengarfio: if you want to loop it, i'd stick with a loop
[05:01:41] <xec> i don't know quite what else to say
[05:08:36] <tirengarfio> So I can not use each because it is not an array?
[05:08:50] <tirengarfio> it is actually an object?
[05:09:05] <xec> you can loop through object properties with $.each(), but you can't call .join() on it
[05:10:16] <tirengarfio> ok
[05:10:20] <tirengarfio> thanks
[05:10:59] <xec> tirengarfio: there are examples for both at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[05:25:32] <RRR2> Is there any possible way to get an event to not bubble or more specifically make an element be not draggable (when it is) when the user clicks a specific child element within?
[05:26:28] <mobile8>  i have a result, eg 1000000 and i would like to add comas into the results for both 4 and 7 digit figures? (ie. 1,000 pesos. 1,000,000 pesos) and only full figures nothing after .
[05:27:34] <sammich> RRR2: http://jqueryui.com/draggable/#handle
[05:31:49] <RRR2> mobile8: I just had this brilliant idea
[05:33:09] <sammich> mobile8: use a number formatter http://josscrowcroft.github.io/accounting.js/
[05:33:16] <sammich> or you could roll your own
[05:36:37] <RRR2> I already did this mess
[05:36:51] <RRR2> aww lets post it anyway "100000".match(/./g).reverse().join('').replace(/.{3}/g,function(a){return a+','}).match(/./g).reverse().join('').replace(/^,/,'')
[05:37:47] <RRR2> Yeah, use a number formatter..
[05:40:11] <xec> you get solid points for trying, not to mention creativity ;)
[05:42:58] <RRR2> What's the best way to convert a string in a array. I don't think String.match(/./g) is right
[05:43:13] <RRR2> It's probably a for loop?
[05:43:17] <sammich> http://jsperf.com/string-reverse-function-test-of-all/3
[05:43:31] <sammich> it's nearly the slowest ;)
[05:43:42] <RRR2> Thank you
[05:43:52] <sammich> actually, it's the slowest, but only just
[05:44:19] <Maoko_> Pew pew everyone. Can someone give me an insight with datatables pretty please?
[05:44:33] <Maoko_> 'm at the very newbie level, but managed to do this http://pastebin.com/kXBb6h3Q . I have a multiselect with values I want to pass to the datatables. And.. I need someone to give me some light.
[05:44:45] <sammich> maybe #rdbms
[05:44:57] <sammich> oops, fail
[05:45:13] <sammich> my reading comprehension is at an all time low
[05:48:35] <RRR2> sammich:
[05:48:38] <RRR2> Take those words back
[05:48:39] <RRR2> http://jsperf.com/string-reverse-function-test-of-all/4
[05:48:42] <RRR2> LOL
[05:49:23] <RRR2> Bijay's code is slower
[05:49:34] <mobile8> thanks guys
[05:51:15] <pachet> function commas(num){num+='';var index=num.length-3;while(index>0){num=num.slice(0,index)+','+num.slice(index);index-=3;}return num;}
[05:52:07] <sammich> RRR2: on chrome here Bijay's is about 20% faster than yours ;)
[05:52:23] <sammich> pachet, does that work since the string is actually a moving target
[05:52:52] <sammich> 1000000 becomes 1000,000, then 10,00,000
[05:53:00] <sammich> since you're hitting every 3rd index
[05:53:09] <edoop> How  do you  estabilish  cost of your  project  ? By hour ?
[05:53:18] <edoop> Then  Time  to   develop ?
[05:53:32] <pachet> sammich it works in reverse
[05:53:41] <pachet> and never places a comma at the tail
[05:53:58] <sammich> that's a comma for grammar, not for the actual string ;)
[05:54:41] <pachet> oh ;
[05:55:15] <pachet> but no, i get 1,000,000 back
[05:55:35] <Cork> if you care about performance you don't want to go over an array
[05:59:30] <pachet> also, since i'm apparently in the mood for code golf this morning:
[05:59:30] <pachet> http://jsperf.com/string-reverse-function-test-of-all/6
[05:59:39] <mobile8> e.type == 'change'
[05:59:47] <mobile8> this should basically work on all input text field changes right?
[05:59:57] <mobile8> to indicate the text field changed
[06:00:47] <sammich> pachet: you win
[06:01:51] <sammich> that bit of code would've saved me so much time
[06:02:04] <sammich> not the reverse, the number formatter
[06:02:19] <Cork> hmm some of the calls use console.log and some don't
[06:02:24] <Cork> that WILL screw the results
[06:02:26] <sammich> don't know why I didn't think of doing it forward
[06:02:40] <sammich> yeah, it spams by log
[06:03:03] <pachet> oh z, didnt even notice that
[06:03:09] <Cork> http://jsperf.com/string-reverse-function-test-of-all/7
[06:03:43] <Cork> heh
[06:04:08] <Cork> console.log moved bbb from 11,682 => 1,181782 :D
[06:04:09] <sammich> did you even notice something peculiar about pachet's sample code?
[06:04:22] <pachet> also, yeah, i dont even invoke the fn
[06:04:23] <pachet> gg
[06:04:23] <sammich> it doesn't even run his damn code :p
[06:04:36] <sammich> no wonder it gets 700mill runs/s
[06:04:48] <Cork> ah, we cross edited...
[06:05:28] <Cork> also mixing strict and none strict isn't fair either
[06:05:55] <mobile8> allowedKeyCodes = [48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 190]; if((e.type == 'keyup' && allowedKeyCodes.indexOf(e.keyCode) != -1) || e.type == 'change' || e == 'start') {}
[06:06:10] <mobile8> Any idea how come this doesn't work for all changes to an input field?
[06:06:23] <mobile8> This gets triggered when I change from 1 to 2
[06:06:28] <mobile8> but not from 1 to 10 (add a 0)
[06:06:33] <sammich> e == 'start'?
[06:06:43] <mobile8> hmm
[06:07:01] <mobile8> not sure what this means
[06:07:04] <Cork> also why don't you just bind input?
[06:07:05] <mobile8> shouldb it be e.type?
[06:07:17] <mobile8> I do
[06:07:23] <mobile8> $from.change(amount_change);
[06:07:31] <Cork> thats change, not input
[06:07:39] <Cork> ?g mdn event input
[06:07:40] <b-ot> Cork: input - Web technology reference | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/input
[06:07:41] <mobile8> how should i do this then
[06:07:49] <Cork> on('input'
[06:08:57] <mobile8> $from.on("change", handler)
[06:09:00] <mobile8> like this Cork
[06:09:04] <mobile8> on input i mean
[06:09:05] <Cork> no input not change
[06:09:09] <mobile8> yea
[06:09:10] <Cork> but ya
[06:09:22] <Cork> it will only triger for visible inputs
[06:09:49] <mobile8> and for select?
[06:09:56] <gonnarule> Does anyone know if there is a french / accentuated version of additional-methods from jquery.validate ?
[06:10:04] <mobile8> Cork: for select dropdowns i mean
[06:10:18] <Cork> uh key on a select element?
[06:10:38] <Cork> mobile8: click/keydown
[06:10:44] <pachet> sanitized: http://jsperf.com/string-reverse-function-test-of-all/9
[06:10:49] <mobile8> Cork: yea
[06:10:54] <pachet> i'd be interested to know why bijay's runs so well on firefox :[
[06:10:59] <mobile8> Cork: why not on change there
[06:11:01] <mobile8> if i may ask
[06:11:02] <Cork> mobile8: input doesn't work for select elements
[06:11:13] <Cork> mobile8: cause it triggers late
[06:11:28] <Cork> mobile8: but if you're ok with that; sure
[06:12:29] <mobile8> Cork: but doesn't click also trigger when you dropdown
[06:12:31] <mobile8> the <select>
[06:12:47] <Cork> mobile8: yes, but not when you move around in the select with the keyboard
[06:12:49] <vinex08> help.. here's my question along with the code... http://pastebin.com/R2NVi5sN
[06:13:00] <mobile8> Cork: ok
[06:15:30] <Cork> sammich: stumbled on this one http://jsperf.com/string-reverse-function-performance
[06:15:57] <sammich> runnink
[06:16:33] <Cork> it statistically points at for o += s[i] as the fastest one (test1)
[06:16:38] <vinex08> here's the jfiffle of it .. http://jsfiddle.net/wKaAe/
[06:22:26] <pachet> why would they use substring in that while loop case :{
[06:23:38] <Cork> just another way to grab the char
[06:24:13] <Cork> pachet: notice that ie is fastes with just that one :)
[06:25:02] <pachet> lol
[06:26:32] <Cork> optimizing js is risky as different engines differ so much
[06:28:23] <Cork> would be fun if it was possible to test with the new struct types :)
[06:28:32] <Cork> i suspect it would have been interesting
[06:29:10] <pachet> or piping char codes in/out of an asm block
[06:29:38] <Cork> that is kinda what the new struct types let you do
[06:30:08] <Cork> you can basically bitblt the values around
[06:30:20] <Cork> and actually...
[06:30:34] <Cork> you could prob set it to be small endian, and then just read the reverse :D
[06:30:41] <pachet> oho
[06:30:43] <Cork> no shifting at all XD
[06:41:41] <mobile8> pachet: here?
[06:41:48] <pachet> hi
[06:42:50] <mobile8> function commas(num){num+='';var index=num.length-3;while(index>0){num=num.slice(0,index)+','+num.slice(index);index-=3;}return num;}
[06:42:55] <mobile8> This returns 1 for 1000000
[06:43:01] <mobile8> instead of 1,000,000
[06:43:24] <RRR2> mobile8: you're not using what I told ya
[06:43:51] <mobile8> Sorry which line ?
[06:43:54] <mobile8> I only saw pachets
[06:44:04] <RRR2> "100000".split("").reverse().join(”).replace(/.{3}/g,function(a){return a+','}).split("").reverse().join(”).replace(/^,/,”)
[06:44:27] <mobile8> $value.split("").reverse().join() ?
[06:44:58] <RRR2> Also known as reversing string
[06:46:15] <mobile8> this doesn't do anything
[06:46:22] <mobile8> ?eval
[06:46:30] <mobile8> !eval
[06:46:31] <mobile8> !help
[06:46:31] <b-ot> mobile8: NO U!
[06:47:30] <RRR2> it doesn't do anything?
[06:47:35] <RRR2> Is there a jsbot in here?
[06:47:46] <pachet> mobile8: er, are you sure about that? i just copy+pasted directly to my repl
[06:47:49] <emx> i see that i can have a draggable and a sortable connected: http://jqueryui.com/draggable/#sortable
[06:47:50] <pachet> '1,000,000'
[06:48:10] <sammich> a sortable is a draggable, isn't it?
[06:48:16] <mobile8> ehm 187000000 or something becomes 1 pachet
[06:48:34] <emx> how can i remove items again? (preferably by dragging)
[06:48:36] <pachet> mobile8 again, not in my repl
[06:48:40] <RRR2> mobile8: also is join("")
[06:48:57] <mobile8> pachet: oh hmm
[06:50:40] <RRR2> Pachet's fucntion actually works too
[06:50:49] <RRR2> mobile8:  do you even console
[06:51:00] <pachet> mobile8: http://jsfiddle.net/vKdWw/
[06:51:05] <mobile8> sec
[06:52:23] <sammich> I did post this before, and it's nothing particularly special, just COLOURS http://pastebin.com/a22Q7APt
[06:53:05] <RRR2> sammich: why not use Hex Colours
[06:53:17] <RRR2> like the old good way
[06:53:32] <sammich> easy to randomise full set of colours?
[06:53:57] <RRR2> Yes, you just need a HSV to RGB function
[06:53:59] <RRR2> LOL
[06:54:11] <RRR2> :p
[06:54:37] <lemonsparrow> i have 4 tabs in a page and 4 of the tab data is being loaded via 4 different document.ready and the tab is set to the one on focus... but during the initial page load, I want the focus to be on the 1st tab but since the data for all the 4 tabs are loading asynchronously it is focusing randomly on different tabs.. is there a way I can fix this ?
[06:54:41] <RRR2> Or you can simply randomize easily 0xFFFFFF or 0xFFF
[06:55:22] <RRR2> Like force the user focus on a tab?
[06:55:35] <sammich> lemonsparrow: the other tabs should just be loaded into the hidden divs, right?
[06:55:42] <sammich> why would they become active?
[06:55:44] <mobile8> 187617.26 * 10 becomes 1.88
[06:55:46] <mobile8> any idea how come?
[06:55:48] <lemonsparrow> sammich: yes
[06:56:13] <lemonsparrow> sammich: but the other tabs document.ready does have showtab(their own tab id) being called
[06:56:13] <RRR2> Fricken floating point numbers
[06:56:27] <sammich> mobile8: your calculator is broken
[06:56:29] <lemonsparrow> sammich: I am using sorter inside the tabs for table data so
[06:56:46] <pachet> mobile8 what in the world are you using for a console
[06:57:02] <RRR2> IE?
[06:57:04] <pachet> because i'm imagining Peewee's magic screen at this point
[06:57:27] <RRR2> I remember IE gave me 0.2+0.1==0.3
[06:57:27] <mobile8> I'm using firebug
[06:57:38] <RRR2> and that's impossible
[06:57:41] <sammich> maybe he's got it in scientific notation, except the E display is broken
[06:57:47] <grafi> RRR2 is a robot
[06:58:01] <pachet> RRR2D2
[06:58:09] <RRR2> NOO
[06:58:26] <sammich> beep beep grrrrrnd brrp
[06:58:30] <mobile8> Sorry I'm getting results from Google calculator
[06:58:36] <RRR2> LOL
[06:58:43] <grafi> http://img7.joyreactor.com/pics/post/comics-SMBC-robot-internet-728197.png
[06:59:02] <RRR2> use firebug for math
[06:59:02] <RRR2> OR firefox web tools
[06:59:25] <sammich> ah, good 'ol binary math
[06:59:26] <mobile8> I use firebug
[06:59:39] <RRR2> mobile8: wot
[06:59:40] <grafi> bugfire
[07:00:12] <sammich> can you switch between frame contexts in firebug?
[07:00:20] <mobile8> Ok I will explain
[07:00:25] <RRR2> Looks liek some1 doesn't even basic JS
[07:00:29] <RRR2> I'm jk
[07:00:51] <RRR2> sammich: I'll attempt it
[07:01:00] <mobile8> I understand basic JS
[07:01:09] <sammich> in Chrome, you just hit the thing at the bottom of inspector
[07:01:25] <RRR2> sammich: Yes, seems you can.
[07:01:44] <sammich> plz xpln
[07:01:46] <mobile8> "1 876.17261 Colombian pesos" - This string I receive from fetching a page with CURL and doing some regexp on it. I remove the alphabetical chars from it applying this regexp on it
[07:01:51] <mobile8> new RegExp('[^0-9.]', 'g');
[07:02:03] <RRR2> Do you speak spanish
[07:02:27] <mobile8> Not so much
[07:02:32] <Cork> sammich: yes you use cd(element-to-switch-to)
[07:02:34] <mobile8> What about you
[07:02:42] <RRR2> I do.
[07:02:46] <RRR2> Just wondering.
[07:02:52] <mobile8> Oh wait you are colombian ?
[07:03:05] <sammich> Cork: not sure if serious, or playing unix dir game with me
[07:03:08] <Cork> sammich: or if you mean in the html viewer it should just be inline in the view
[07:03:11] <sammich> scratch dir
[07:03:16] <sammich> scratch unix*
[07:03:26] <Cork> ?g firebug cd command
[07:03:27] <b-ot> Cork: Command Line API - FirebugWiki → http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Command_Line_API
[07:03:48] <sammich> ah, that's what I needed
[07:04:00] <RRR2> mobile8: why are you targeting colombia, if I may ask?
[07:04:03] <bleen> is there a difference in efficiency between  $('#id .class')  and    $('#id').find('.class')
[07:04:04] <sammich> still, wish it was a dropdown like in Chrome, so I don't need to hunt down the name of the frae
[07:04:15] <mobile8> Not specifically RRR2
[07:04:16] <sammich> sounds like a job for jsperf
[07:04:29] <sammich> but I think it's the .find()
[07:04:34] <sammich> that's faster
[07:04:36] <Cork> sam452: you can tab autocomplete
[07:04:43] <Cork> *sammich:
[07:04:48] <RRR2> bleen: jQuery.fn.init uses find anyway so they do the same
[07:04:59] <mobile8> anyway,
[07:05:18] <sammich> Cork: ah, okay thaks
[07:05:20] <mobile8> The problem is that 187617.261 * 10 = 1.87617261
[07:05:26] <bleen> RRR2: thx
[07:05:27] <mobile8> Is this normal to add this . ?
[07:05:33] <sammich> where are you running that to get that number?
[07:05:53] <mobile8> sammich: sec
[07:05:58] <RRR2> WOT
[07:06:09] <RRR2> How you need a sec to answer that, lulz
[07:06:13] <mobile8> curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, 'http://www.google.com/ig/calculator?q=' . $amount . $from . '=?' . $to);
[07:06:17] <RRR2> oh
[07:06:19] <RRR2> nvm
[07:06:19] <mobile8> To find the line of code :)
[07:06:21] <sammich> I think that '10' is masquerading as a 0.000001
[07:06:25] <RRR2> Wait
[07:06:35] <RRR2> WOT
[07:06:46] <RRR2> ARE you serious
[07:06:52] <mobile8> You asked where this was coming from
[07:06:57] <sammich> yeah, that sounds like the right way to use a calculator
[07:07:14] <RRR2> Why don't you use a console, why you send a request!?
[07:07:21] <sammich> wow
[07:07:29] <mobile8> to calc currency
[07:07:35] <RRR2> Ah
[07:07:39] <RRR2> That's more reasonable
[07:07:43] <RRR2> but still
[07:07:48] <sammich> why don't you just get the rate, store it, then use that
[07:08:07] <mobile8> That would be an idea, I'm kind of fixing a non working script hehe
[07:08:38] <RRR2> is there a website that sends all the currency rates
[07:08:42] <RRR2> cause that would help
[07:08:49] <sammich> there's gotta be heaps
[07:08:57] <grafi> google
[07:08:59] <grafi> ^^
[07:09:11] <mobile8> google yea
[07:09:13] <mobile8> lets see
[07:09:28] <RRR2> No, but you have to send each request for each currency
[07:09:28] <RRR2> Something like a list
[07:09:31] <sammich> http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/#h=select%20%2a%20from%20json%20where%20url%3D%22http%3A//finance.yahoo.com/webservice/v1/symbols/allcurrencies/quote%3Fformat%3Djson%22
[07:09:41] <mobile8> RRR2: how do you mean?
[07:09:42] <sammich> all of them
[07:10:07] <sammich> apparently that's every combo too..
[07:10:15] <sammich> nope, just USD
[07:10:19] <mobile8> hmm
[07:10:24] <mobile8> anyway, say i stick with this code
[07:10:31] <mobile8> Which isn't the most efficient but basically works
[07:10:38] <sammich> I'd be much more comfortable with JSON
[07:10:40] <RRR2> Are you SQL hacking yahoo
[07:10:40] <RRR2> wait
[07:10:41] <sammich> or XML
[07:10:42] <RRR2> Yahoo lets you SQL hack it directly
[07:10:48] <RRR2> lolz
[07:10:57] <sammich> delete * from *
[07:11:18] <mobile8> Anyway how come !?!
[07:11:25] <mobile8>  187617.261 * 10 = 1.87617261
[07:11:30] <utroda> Any know how you would go about, changing the background color of a lists li elements to be fade from a color to white. Something like this - http://c.wearedifrnt.com/2bzI
[07:12:04] <sammich> utroda: use opacity with rgba
[07:12:08] <mobile8> Or better, what should I do to the int 187617.261 ? to make it 10 times more and not returning 1.87617261
[07:12:18] <mobile8> to the float i mean
[07:12:43] <sammich> or use HSV values, I think?
[07:12:54] <mobile8> sammich or RRR2 any idea?
[07:12:56] <sammich> I'm not familiar with those colour thingies
[07:13:18] <RRR2> sammich: I am not either
[07:13:26] <utroda> sammich: me either.. tried google, but no luck really or I'm just searching the wrong thing lol
[07:13:29] <RRR2> sammich: Should have reverse engineered Photoshop algorithms
[07:14:03] <visua> utroda just iterate the color value
[07:14:09] <RRR2> mobile8: since this is #jQuery, I'll use the JavaScript way number *10;
[07:14:12] <grafi> hsl is probably awesome for that
[07:14:15] <visua> less / sass have this built in
[07:14:34] <visua> http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/Sass/Script/Functions.html
[07:14:56] <visua> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory
[07:16:06] <utroda> visua: i'm using less, any thoughts on the mixin?
[07:16:23] <Voziv> Is it better to attach a document event listener or attach 50/100/1000 event listeners in a loop
[07:17:43] <sammich> err
[07:17:51] <sammich> delegate, baby
[07:17:59] <mobile8> RRR2: ahh i found it
[07:18:01] <mobile8> pffff
[07:18:16] <mobile8> the google calculator returns an amount in trillions, millions etc
[07:18:39] <mobile8>  187617.261 * 10 = 1.87617261 (1.87 million)
[07:18:55] <mobile8> Bah, don't feel like fixing this :(
[07:19:18] <adamgoose> Is there any way to set a browser to trigger Ћ change event when it autofills a login field?
[07:19:40] <mobile8> sammich: ^^
[07:20:01] <mobile8> This quite sucks
[07:20:32] <Tomashe> hey guys , im trying to control my html5 video using js , but looks like it isnt working : $(".p-services-vid video").play;
[07:20:44] <adamgoose> Tomashe try .play()??
[07:20:45] <RRR2> my wireless sucks
[07:20:48] <Voziv> .play()?
[07:20:57] <Voziv> I was too slow :(
[07:21:48] <Tomashe> isnt working aswell :/
[07:21:48] <RRR2> or you can simply set a GETTer so it behaves like play() when you do play;
[07:21:49] <RRR2> Wait, that's not simple..
[07:22:08] <Tomashe> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'play'
[07:23:05] <Tomashe> i just want that on HOVER the video will play.. so i made hover jquery function and inside it i put the .play() on the object
[07:23:21] <Tomashe> but as u can see the error
[07:26:36] <Tomashe> that solve it : $(this)[0].play();
[07:29:04] <RRR2> I h8 this internet
[07:29:04] <RRR2> HTMLVideoElement -> HTMLMediaElement -> HTMLElement -> Element -> Node -> Object.
[07:29:22] <SoulRaven> hello, plase help me to find a good splitter plugin
[07:29:54] <RRR2> splitter?
[07:29:56] <SoulRaven> i have found some plugins, but not either is not working with 1.10.1
[07:30:28] <SoulRaven> RRR2: http://methvin.com/splitter/3psplitter.html or http://www.jqwidgets.com/jquery-widgets-demo/demos/jqxsplitter/index.htm?(web)#demos/jqxsplitter/defaultfunctionality.htm
[07:30:52] <SoulRaven> https://www.google.ro/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&ved=0CFkQFjAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fe1ven%2FjQuery-Splitter&ei=fusEUujqIcXMtAa5zoDYCw&usg=AFQjCNGJMLzAH28a7f9FSWSDR-yfnomJkw&sig2=domwX32S2qzhyhvdNrmOQQ
[07:30:59] <SoulRaven> https://github.com/e1ven/jQuery-Splitter
[07:32:43] <RRR2> Tomashe: In the case jQuery doesn't want to inherit the DOM property try getting the DOM element instead of the jQuery object
[07:33:28] <adavia> Any idea why i got this problem when i drag the dialog to the left.. im not able to drag it down http://jsfiddle.net/MrqDv/3/
[07:33:31] <RRR2> Tomashe: why would you use ever use "$(this)[0]" instead of "this"
[07:34:13] <RRR2> Tomashe: Can't you write a line of code without having a $ or something?
[07:35:48] <sammich> I was gonna say, can you write a whole script with a $ in every line
[07:36:02] <sammich> then I realised, you can write whole scripts in one line
[07:36:20] <CiE|Work> Hey guys i have a simple question i use a framework and i can pass parameters between functions in a controller, How would i be able to pass those parameters to the functions when i make an ajax call?
[07:36:31] <RRR2> sammich: Use statement, then.
[07:37:47] <emx> how do i get the element that was dragged from a draggable into a sortable? the event "receive" is triggered but ui.item is the item from draggable. so i assume that a copy is made from that draggable-item, so how do i get a reference to the copy?
[07:38:04] <sammich> that is the copy
[07:38:16] <RRR2> jQuery(jQuery(this)[0])[0]  am i cool yet
[07:38:29] <sammich> not enough jQceptions
[07:39:38] <emx> sammich, it's not. when i add a class then it is not added to the copy but to the original element dragged from the draggable-element.
[07:40:07] <sammich> draggables don't remove the original
[07:40:17] <sammich> sortables 'move'
[07:40:25] <ruby_on_tails> is there something like http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/ for substrings ?
[07:40:34] <sammich> so you'll need to detach and readd
[07:41:05] <RRR2> jQuery().constructor().constructor(jQuery(this)[0]).constructor(this)[0]
[07:41:08] <emx> sammich, the only problem i got is: i don't know how to get a reference to the newly created draggable in the sortable.
[07:42:34] <sammich> you'll have to make one
[07:42:35] <adavia> Any idea why i got this problem when i drag the dialog to the left.. im not able to drag it down http://jsfiddle.net/MrqDv/3/
[07:42:41] <sammich> use an id
[07:44:05] <emx> sammich, so the workaround looks like this? 1) attach to create event of the helper 2) give it an id 3) access the helper by that id? but then i ask myself why there is a ui.helper (which is NULL)...
[07:44:46] <SoulRaven> anyone?use any split plugin that works with 1.10.1
[07:44:47] <SoulRaven> ?
[07:45:25] <RRR2> SoulRaven: I'm trying to access your links you gave me
[07:45:40] <RRR2> SoulRaven: why don't you explain what is a 'splitter'?
[07:46:07] <SoulRaven> a plugin, that permits to redimension or colapse a div element
[07:46:55] <RRR2> redimension?
[07:47:10] <RRR2> I understand
[07:47:28] <SoulRaven> i say "splitter" because most of the plugins that make resize and collapse of a div, are named "splliter"
[07:47:38] <RRR2> I think I can't help you with that.
[07:47:50] <RRR2> I'd use div.style.width, height
[07:48:39] <RRR2> theres the css property method on the jQuery object I think it accesses the style of the element
[07:49:28] <RRR2> What exactly do you mean collapsing a div?
[07:49:34] <RRR2> Adjusting div to contents?
[07:49:44] <sammich> emx: sorry, had to afk
[07:49:59] <emx> sammich, no problem
[07:50:05] <SoulRaven> nu, when you click on the part of the div, that div to reduce size
[07:50:15] <sammich> I've done a few, but not this combo. If you have a draggable into a sortable, by default, it will make a copy of that draggable into the sortable list?
[07:51:09] <sammich> emx ^
[07:52:12] <emx> sammich, during the dragging it is the original. when you drop the original on a sortable then a copy is created from the original. ui.item references the original and the copy has no reference (which should be ui.helper, in my opinion)
[07:52:48] <emx> the original is reverted to the draggable container and the copy is added to the sortable.
[07:53:04] <RRR2> SoulRaven: Try using events, or another version of jQuery, or making your own plugin
[07:53:33] <sammich> what I usually do is get the id: ui.item.id (or something like that), select the original with that id (you might have to make sure it's not the other one)
[07:53:46] <sammich> then remove
[07:54:06] <sammich> if the new copy in the sortable has the same id, then you now have a unique copy
[07:54:19] <sammich> and you can reference it via the id
[07:54:37] <sammich> I would typically give each row an id, make so many things easier
[07:55:23] <grafi> utroda http://jsfiddle.net/kg3JP/
[07:55:32] <emx> that would be an easy workaround.
[07:55:33] <emx> i have to evaluate. thanks.
[07:56:07] <Anticom> hi all, i've patched the datepicker widget using css .ui-datepicker-calendar{display:none} to convert it into a monthpicker. now i've got the requirement, that i need a month picker aswell as a date ( / day) picker on the same page
[07:56:22] <sammich> emx: no worries. I have to go now though, good luck!
[07:56:29] <Anticom> is there any way to add an additional class to the .ui-datepicker-calendar class in the datepicker constructor?
[07:56:38] <emx> sammich, thanks
[07:58:18] <adavia> any help with this? http://jsfiddle.net/MrqDv/3/
[08:02:27] <BillCriswell> adavia: You should explain what exactly you need help with. I clicked the link and didn't see an error or anything and nothing appears to "need help" so you're kind of just wasting people's time by not giving more details.
[08:02:46] <adavia> BillCriswell:  try to drag the dialog to the left
[08:03:01] <adavia> BillCriswell: youll not gonna be able to drag it down
[08:08:39] <adavia> BillCriswell:  i thought maybe theres something wrong with the ui widget
[08:09:35] <rcr> can i remove the 'disabled' attribute of a specific checkbox based on its name?   I tried something like  $("input[name='thebox']).removeAttr('disabled');
[08:09:37] <rcr> didnt work
[08:09:53] <BillCriswell> adavia: I don't have a lot of experience with jQuery UI but I think I get what's going on.
[08:11:06] <rcr> nevermind... i was calling it from the wrong place. derp.
[08:11:38] <adavia> BillCriswell:  if you drag the dialog to the left and you stop dragging it then it must maximize half window
[08:13:20] <BillCriswell> adavia: Why do you have the height set to winH when that happens?
[08:13:35] <BillCriswell> winH / 2 would get it to fill half the space
[08:15:29] <adavia> BillCriswell:  umm let me check that
[08:16:02] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/MrqDv/4/ should do it, but the reason you couldn't drag it down is because it was taking 100 of the width ( it seemed to be doing that until you tried dragging again.
[08:16:12] <BillCriswell> 100% of the height*
[08:16:58] <dingz> hey people, can i "stack" collapisble items in jquery-mobile?
[08:17:02] <BillCriswell> It's kind of weird, even when the height is adjusted it still thinks the block is 100%  of the height
[08:17:21] <dingz> i.e. some <h3> followed by lists and then the next <h3>?
[08:17:48] <dingz> cans then collapse and "de-collapse" all of a section?
[08:18:42] <adavia> BillCriswell:  umm but is not maximizing in that fiddle
[08:18:53] <adavia> when you drag it left
[08:19:15] <adavia> yeah that was happenning
[08:19:16] <BillCriswell> You said "maximize half window.
[08:19:56] <adavia> BillCriswell:  in your fiddle when i drag it to left is not maximizing half window
[08:20:17] <adavia> BillCriswell:  however is letting me drag it down
[08:20:32] <BillCriswell> How do you maximize half window?
[08:21:46] <Machei> hi all, here can talk about problem with jquery?
[08:22:07] <Machei> first time on IRC
[08:23:05] <adavia> BillCriswell:  have you seen in my fiddle the dialog increase its height when i drag it left.. woww this damn weird
[08:23:06] <dingz> Machei: i think you'll just have to spit it out (your question)
[08:24:05] <BillCriswell> adavia: It doesn't seem like it's updating the dialogs height
[08:24:14] <adavia> BillCriswell:  right
[08:24:20] <adavia> BillCriswell:  i dont know why
[08:25:26] <Machei> I am using method extend() with made contructor of two functions, if i call second function from 1st function. example : $.extend({func1:function()this.func2();},funct2:function(){}},options); ?
[08:27:31] <Machei> Then i got error Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token this
[08:27:48] <adavia> BillCriswell:  dont you think jquery ui bug?
[08:28:04] <BillCriswell> I rarely jump to the bug conclusion lol
[08:28:31] <adavia> yeah me too but this is driving me nutz
[08:28:44] <duch_kazatel> more often than no the bug is yours, not jquery/jquery ui's.
[08:29:41] <Machei> I am not using jquery UI, normally i was trying to make new plugin
[08:30:18] <soahccc> Is there any reason to do this in two steps? printStackTrace.implementation = function() {}; printStackTrace.implementation.prototype = { ...... }
[08:31:34] <Machei> soahcc you need to implemantation new class
[08:31:55] <Machei> or use extend
[08:32:05] <duch_kazatel> javascript doesn't have classes fyi.  prototypes only.
[08:32:23] <Machei> ah
[08:32:24] <soahccc> Machei: I was just curious why can't you just put the methods directly into the first step?
[08:32:43] <duch_kazatel> soahccc - you can.  why are you defining them via a prototype like that?
[08:33:08] <Machei> prinkStackTrace is static class initialized from browser?
[08:33:12] <DarsVaeda> if I select several objects an bind a click event to all of them, when one is clicked is there a way to know which one (number of all) it was
[08:33:13] <Machei> then i dont know
[08:33:28] <DarsVaeda> aka get the key of all selected object
[08:33:30] <DarsVaeda> +s
[08:33:49] <duch_kazatel> if you want to use prototypes, create your parent object, then inherit from that.
[08:34:45] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/prototype <- good info about prototypes in JS
[08:34:58] <soahccc> duch_kazatel: It's not my script but I want to fix some issues and stumbled over this... https://github.com/errbit/errbit/blob/master/public/javascripts/notifier.js#L67
[08:35:28] <duch_kazatel> interesting.  i wonder why they're doing it that way.
[08:35:41] <spobat> hi
[08:36:08] <spobat> <p><button ...></p> If i have an onclicklistener for that p, is is possible to detect whether the button was clicked?
[08:36:23] <soahccc> duch_kazatel: I also don't get why there is a undefined in line 2 in the function header so maybe this is just some weird stuff
[08:36:32] <spobat> I need the button object then, because the p has > 100 buttons :D
[08:37:02] <duch_kazatel> spobat - yes: $('p').on('click', 'button', function(e){...});
[08:37:10] <spobat> will it work dynamically?
[08:37:14] <duch_kazatel> the $(this) object will now be the button you clicked.
[08:37:16] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[08:37:20] <spobat> will it still work if new buttons are added?
[08:37:26] <duch_kazatel> as long as that parent <p> exists when you bind the event.
[08:37:27] <duch_kazatel> yes
[08:37:30] <spobat> okay :)
[08:37:34] <spobat> thank you
[08:37:39] <duch_kazatel> that uses event delegation to handle button clicks.
[08:37:40] <duch_kazatel> np
[08:37:51] <NoiseEee> spobat: .on('p',function(e) { var actualElementClicked = $(e.target) })
[08:38:02] <NoiseEee> duch_kazatel: iirc $(this) in that situation will always be the p
[08:38:18] <duch_kazatel> the p that was clicked, NoiseEee.
[08:38:28] <duch_kazatel> err, not the p, the button.
[08:38:31] <NoiseEee> he's asking about figuring out which button within that p
[08:38:33] <soahccc> What does $(this) represent? ev.target or ev.delegateTarget?
[08:38:40] <RRR2> You can use "this" not "this"
[08:38:49] <RRR2> lolz
[08:38:56] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: jQuery UI doesn't seem to be updating the dialog's height, it's really weird.
[08:39:15] <RRR2> this would represent the.. jQuery object where the on element is attached to I think?
[08:39:21] <BillCriswell> Like I see it happening visually, but it's kept bounded by the height it used to be, so weird.
[08:39:49] <BillCriswell> adavia: http://jsfiddle.net/MrqDv/5/ I've been debugging with this but no luck... I thin I have to work on my real work now though. :'(
[08:39:50] <RRR2> $(element).on(randomfunction(){  this is $(element) })
[08:39:51] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/crRsF/ @ duch_kazatel
[08:40:09] <RRR2> I think
[08:40:13] <NoiseEee> yes RRR2
[08:40:27] <duch_kazatel> NoiseEee - you're missing the #myButton in the on event...
[08:40:34] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/BVsk6/
[08:40:41] <adavia> BillCriswell:  no problem buddy.. thanks for the help btw
[08:41:22] <RRR2> However is there truly a need for $(this) ? isn't "this" a jQuery object?
[08:41:37] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/BVsk6/1/
[08:42:02] <RRR2> or "this" is the DOM element?
[08:42:10] <duch_kazatel> "this" is the dom element.
[08:42:18] <duch_kazatel> $(this) is the jquery-fied dom element.
[08:42:34] <duch_kazatel> so it inherits all the jquery methods, etc.
[08:42:40] <RRR2> I understand
[08:42:54] <NoiseEee> duch_kazatel: yes the difference between yours and mine is you're specifically listening on buttons via the 2nd arg, i'm listening on the div entirely
[08:43:11] <RRR2> I still rage when I see $(this)[0]
[08:43:13] <duch_kazatel> NoiseEee - no, I'm listen to the div and matching all buttons that get clicked within it.
[08:43:18] <duch_kazatel> *listening
[08:43:24] <duch_kazatel> I'm using event delegation in my model.
[08:43:42] <NoiseEee> duch_kazatel: correct, and as a result, your $(this) is a different element within the handler
[08:43:56] <duch_kazatel> NoiseEee - did you see the example I posted?
[08:44:00] <NoiseEee> duch_kazatel: imo, one should aways use e.target to be clear / no misunderstandings
[08:44:01] <duch_kazatel> $(this) is the clicked button.
[08:44:03] <NoiseEee> duch_kazatel: yes
[08:44:13] <duch_kazatel> I've always used $(this) in that context with no issue.
[08:44:16] <NoiseEee> duch_kazatel: and in mine, without delegation, $(this) is the div surrounding the button
[08:45:00] <duch_kazatel> i guess to me it's a case of "why not leverage the framework?"
[08:45:11] <duch_kazatel> different approach i guess..
[08:46:55] <spobat> duch_kazatel: thanks again, this solution saved my ass. I was just about to add some js-string aka "onclick='...'" to about each child
[08:47:34] <duch_kazatel> np - just remember to do something like $myElement = $(this); early in that function to make it clear wtf your context is.
[08:48:03] <duch_kazatel> (don't call it $myElement, obviously)
[08:49:02] <spobat> .__.
[08:52:48] <adavia> Anyone familiar with jquery ui?
[08:53:57] <RRR2> No.
[08:54:43] <kborchers> adavia: what's up?
[08:56:07] <adavia> kborchers:  in my fiddle im trying to drag the dialog to the left and make increases its height half window however it is not allowing me to drag it down when that happens http://jsfiddle.net/MrqDv/3/
[09:01:03] <spobat> $id.on('hover', 'img', function(e){}) does not work, #id.on('mouseenter mouseleave', 'img', function(e){}) does.
[09:01:08] <spobat> Is this intended?
[09:01:58] <duch_kazatel> $id and #id are different - is that the real code?
[09:03:03] <duch_kazatel> and 'hover' isn't an event you can use in .on like that.
[09:03:14] <Bloomberg> Hello Guys!!
[09:03:41] <spobat> duch_kazatel: they are the same, yep
[09:03:49] <spobat> I just read, hover has been removed in 1.9
[09:03:50] <spobat> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:03:59] <spobat> in "Additional Notes"
[09:04:05] <spobat> first paragraph
[09:04:13] <spobat> second *
[09:05:24] <duch_kazatel> spobat - why not just use .hover()?
[09:06:38] <NoiseEee> well hover always was a shortcut to those
[09:07:54] <spobat> duch_kazatel: will it work dynamically?
[09:08:12] <duch_kazatel> not sure.  i'd try :)
[09:10:27] <spobat> As what i know, it does not :}
[09:10:40] <spobat> I am fine with #id.on('mouseenter mouseleave', 'img', function(e){})  :D
[09:12:26] <nhulea> yo!
[09:13:07] <baordog> is there a particular way that php functions should be formatted to send data back to $.post requests?
[09:14:15] <adavia> que kgda
[09:15:26] <Lucent> is there a simple replacement for bodyOffset now that it's gone?
[09:15:34] <nub> how do i check if user is zooming in or out using jquery?
[09:15:34] <nub> how do i check if user is zooming in or out using jquery?
[09:19:16] <RRR2> use google
[09:19:34] <nubb> dont u think i did?
[09:20:34] <NoiseEee> baordog: in general, one sends back JSON from PHP to JS
[09:21:11] <baordog> OK, I think I could figure that out, but does the return keyword do it?
[09:22:56] <NoiseEee> no, you echo json_encode($someStuffToSendBack);  ##php
[09:23:08] <NoiseEee> and send appropriate json headers
[09:25:00] <baordog> bingo! it worked
[09:25:00] <blib> anyone using handlebars here?

[09:27:02] <shoky> adavia: here's a hacky workaround.. http://jsfiddle.net/MrqDv/10/
[09:28:48] <adavia> damn shoky  you rock
[09:29:22] <adavia> shoky:  any idea what was the problem
[09:30:23] <myeagleflies> hi
[09:31:09] <shoky> adavia: it's an issue with the draggable's containment, it needs to be re-calculated after changing the element size. simplified here: http://jsfiddle.net/MrqDv/11/
[09:31:20] <myeagleflies> I'm looking for a way to encode binary image using base64. I'm trying window.btoa but it shows some exception which seems to be caused by binary data
[09:31:42] <adavia> shoky:  ohhh now i get it
[09:33:02] <adavia> shoky:  thankkss buddy !!
[09:33:25] <shoky> adavia: np
[09:34:35] <AwesomePossum> How can I append a DOM element in multiple locations?
[09:34:54] <NoiseEee> you'd need to clone it each time before appending
[09:34:55] <shoky> `api clone
[09:34:56] <b-ot> shoky: .clone(): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[09:35:21] <AwesomePossum> NoiseEee, shoky, Thanks.
[09:39:18] <nhulea> I have this var date1 = new Date($('input#visit1_date').val()); which get a val() from a datepicker from jquery ui it spits out dates like this Sun Aug 2013 00:00:00 GMT -0700 (Pacific Daylight Time) when I alert date1 I was trying to reformat it so I can do a date range if this date falls within this range show other wise hide is ther a good way to format that output ? thanks
[09:43:00] <adavia> shoky:  one question where did u get cacheHelperProportions ?
[09:44:46] <shoky> adavia: it's an internal jquery-ui function for draggables
[09:45:14] <shoky> adavia: it's not documented. same with _setContainment
[09:45:57] <adavia> shoky:  yeah that's what i was trying to find out
[09:49:15] <NoiseEee> nhulea: dates in JS are super annoying, i use moment.js for everything date related
[09:51:07] <nhulea> ok cool I will take a look at that
[09:52:02] <RRR2> What's wrong with the date constructor
[09:53:11] <jquery> http://pastebin.com/uasKLsny  <-- How do i make it that every sees the same time instead of changed by timezone?
[09:54:07] <NoiseEee> RRR2: nothings wrong with the constructor, its awesome. but for date calculations, gimme a libary
[09:54:34] <PsychoCarrot> No one?
[09:55:40] <NoiseEee> theres a great example of when to use moment.js, PsychoCarrot
[09:57:33] <PsychoCarrot> Well i'm rather only starting using jquery. How do i use moment.js?
[10:01:06] <roflmaus> I would like users to be able to uncheck radio buttons. How do i do that?
[10:02:00] <duch_kazatel> why not use checkboxes instead?
[10:02:17] <roflmaus> duch_kazatel, because a user should be allowed only one option out of a set of options.
[10:02:46] <roflmaus> duch_kazatel, but leaving no radios selected is is a valid choice.
[10:03:07] <duch_kazatel> hrm.  maybe make another radio that says "none"?  dunno that users will know to "click again to unselect"
[10:03:29] <NoiseEee> roflmaus: there's no real 'good way', you can make a left-click thingy that does it, which is sometimes used
[10:03:51] <roflmaus> NoiseEee, i failed to find a solution that is less than 20 lines of code long.
[10:04:37] <NoiseEee> roflmaus: what about just checking if its presently checked? or does that always fire true?
[10:04:49] <roflmaus> NoiseEee, it does. :(
[10:05:02] <nhulea> NoiseEee: looking good I think it s workin
[10:12:17] <roflmaus> NoiseEee, i made radio buttons uncheckable by setting/unsetting a `selected` class. Ugly, but it's simple and it works without hassle.
[10:12:38] <NoiseEee> interesting roflmaus
[10:13:27] <duch_kazatel> roflmaus users may not know you can "unselect" things like that, so you might add some flavortext that notes they can do that.
[10:13:32] <Al1> hello
[10:14:54] <arkore> yes, Web Usability is important
[10:15:35] <roflmaus> duch_kazatel, arkore, i've been given a psd template that i should make a reality of. It has checkboxes and radios styled identically. And i'm not allowed to discus the design solutions.
[10:15:54] <Al1> im not so good with dates and times, and need help with figuring out how to mod this plug in - http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/ - i got the time range to work, but if i pick time in a first input, it'll prefill second input, but i need to add extra hour to the second input, i.e. so that it's one hour ahead of the previously selected time
[10:16:14] <duch_kazatel> roflmaus - then your design team is... interesting.
[10:16:43] <arkore> roflmaus, part of your job is web usability and maybe your design team lacks experience in that field, and therefore it's your role ot educate them?
[10:16:47] <roflmaus> duch_kazatel, it's rather client than my team to blame.
[10:17:02] <arkore> its company's job to educate the client
[10:17:06] <duch_kazatel> ^^^
[10:17:08] <duch_kazatel> what arkore said.
[10:17:29] <roflmaus> In ideal world, i'd do as you say.
[10:17:42] <duch_kazatel> whenever possible, push back when somebody is trying to "rock the boat" for basics like that.  otherwise you get a solution that is inconsistent with the rest of the web which confues end users and eventually pushes them away.
[10:19:14] <blindMoe> possibly not the right channel for this but here it goes, anyone ever created a page where someone can get google maps directions and have it open them in their phones navigation app?
[10:19:37] <duch_kazatel> "open them in their phones navigation app"?
[10:19:40] <duch_kazatel> like, automatically?
[10:19:46] <blindMoe> yeap
[10:19:59] <roflmaus> duch_kazatel, arkore, I'm meeting my teamlead in a coffee shop this weekend. I'll tell him your considerations (with which i fully agree). I bet a jar of beer that in response he'll smile and say "i know, fella, i know", and nothing gonna happen.
[10:20:19] <duch_kazatel> roflmaus - as long as he knows :3
[10:20:39] <roflmaus> duch_kazatel, he does. *sigh*
[10:20:56] <NoiseEee> roflmaus: UX > UI too bad
[10:22:18] <duch_kazatel> and blindMoe that sounds like a really... weird idea.
[10:22:24] <duch_kazatel> i don't think it's possible, either.
[10:22:33] <blindMoe> duch_kazatel: Google maps does it now and I ahve seen other sites do it
[10:23:07] <blindMoe> people look up my clients stores on the phone already and get directions
[10:23:11] <duch_kazatel> you'd probably have to create your own app and site, then - how do I make a map magically autoopen on my phone?
[10:23:32] <roflmaus> NoiseEee, duch_kazatel, arkore, here's the template BTW: http://d.pr/i/Jb8q+ The UNSET price sliver is supposed to be set to a certain value, and the state set/unset is displayed with a color and not with sliders. Imagine how i feel hacking jQuery UI Slider to be counter-intuitive...
[10:23:33] <blindMoe> duch_kazatel: if you are interested, when I figure it out I will let you know
[10:23:49] <nhulea> hey in dates is 0 counted as a number and its lets 0-11 for month not 1-12?
[10:23:59] <duch_kazatel> blindMoe - I mean show me where in google maps I can have maps auto-open on my phone.
[10:24:09] <NoiseEee> roflmaus: it will make a good tale to tell at your next job interview ;)
[10:24:13] <duch_kazatel> i know i can send directions that way.
[10:24:21] <blindMoe> duch_kazatel: go to google maps on your phone and get directions to something
[10:24:28] <blindMoe> on the bottom it will say "Open in Google Maps App"
[10:24:40] <blindMoe> duch_kazatel: you seem skeptical about something you obviously haven't looked for :)
[10:24:41] <duch_kazatel> so you mean on a mobile website, then.
[10:24:52] <blindMoe> yes.. the mobile web site
[10:25:10] <duch_kazatel> no, i thought you meant go to google maps on a desktop and have it auto-open maps on your mobile device.
[10:25:12] <gordian> looking for a responsive slider that will accomodate variable width slides WITHOUT any gaps between the slides
[10:25:17] <blindMoe> I can see how you were confused now... desktop -> mobile app wouldn't happen
[10:25:21] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[10:25:22] <duch_kazatel> lol
[10:25:24] <roflmaus> NoiseEee, the tale is that it's my NEW job actually...
[10:25:32] <gordian> any recommendations?
[10:25:33] <NoiseEee> roflmaus: eep!
[10:25:53] <duch_kazatel> and afaik I think google maps auto-opens when you supply the in-phone browser with the right URL.
[10:26:00] <gordian> i really like flexslider but it's not flexible enough for this… at least i don't think
[10:26:00] <PsychoCarrot> NoiseEee:  Could you explain it?
[10:26:13] <duch_kazatel> just like the twitter app is registered to open links to twitter's site.
[10:26:29] <duch_kazatel> so you might not have to do much of anything but supply the correctly formatted link.
[10:26:30] <duch_kazatel> brb
[10:27:07] <NoiseEee> PsychoCarrot: all i can say is that moment.js makes it trivial to parse, use and calculate dates, as well as provide date display in a specific time zone (instead of local), as you asked... http://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string-format/
[10:29:10] <duch_kazatel> back
[10:30:45] <phrearch> hi
[10:31:25] <horsik> guys
[10:32:06] <duch_kazatel> dudes
[10:33:01] <horsik> is it common to use smartphones in vertical position browsing the web?
[10:33:19] <duch_kazatel> very
[10:33:27] <duch_kazatel> imagine how most people use smartphones.
[10:33:51] <horsik> it's hard for me because I don't own one
[10:33:52] <duch_kazatel> pull it out of their pocket one-handed, open it one-handed, look at it one-handed.
[10:34:24] <duch_kazatel> tilting it sideways while holding it one handed and interacting with it is awkward.
[10:35:02] <nhulea> is it possible to do stuff like if (var1 < var2 < var3) {}
[10:35:27] <horsik> I tought they use it vertically only when doing simple tasks
[10:35:41] <horsik> like reading texts or calling someone
[10:35:56] <duch_kazatel> horsik - I use it vertically for almost everything but watching videos.
[10:36:01] <duch_kazatel> are you making a mobile site?
[10:36:42] <horsik> just site
[10:37:32] <saimon69> hello, have what i think is a race condition problem betweet two doc.ready groups; i wish the second one was executed after the first one, that i cannot modify
[10:37:37] <horsik> it's not directed specifically for mobile
[10:37:43] <saimon69> instead the new one got executed first
[10:38:14] <Al1> hi, http://jsfiddle.net/albertpak/nMcm5/7/ - i got the times pre-filled in a second input, but can someone help me out how to make it 1 hour ahead? I've been searching through stackoverflow and can't find something relevant
[10:40:01] <horsik> duch_kazatel: the thing is I've got a svg interactive graph made using raphael
[10:40:19] <horsik> and it's somewhat complex
[10:41:41] <horsik> but it's completely unreadable in vertical layout
[10:42:05] <duch_kazatel> if you're making a site mobile compatible, you have a lot of concerns to worry about ;)
[10:44:51] <horsik> duch_kazatel: I'm not familiar with responsive design
[10:45:18] <horsik> but I'm checking out zurb foudation in this project
[10:45:44] <duch_kazatel> horsik - if you want to have a decent mobile site, you'll need to start.  sounds like the webapp you're building might not be good for mobile in the first place.
[10:50:34] <horsik> duch_kazatel: I think it could be but I have to solve these minor problems
[10:50:40] <nhulea> is it possible to do an inequality like this a > b > c
[10:54:09] <gordian> looking for a responsive slider that will accomodate variable width slides WITHOUT any gaps between the slides
[10:54:49] <gordian> something like here but more stable: http://unikaa.net/
[10:55:08] <gordian> i'm actually trying to modify flexslider to do that but running into some issues
[10:55:13] <gordian> anyone familiar with flexslider?
[10:56:28] <roflmaus> gordian, it might be a pure CSS issue
[10:56:48] <gordian> roflmaus: i thought it might be too
[10:56:58] <gordian> but it's not all CSS
[10:57:22] <gordian> on init, all slide widths get set to the viewport width
[10:57:56] <gordian> if i set it to auto then it kind works, but the transitions don't work because they use the viewport width to calculate the translate distance
[10:58:18] <gordian> if i could use the width of the previous slide then it should work
[10:58:20] <gordian> maybe
[10:58:35] <gordian> but i'm having difficulty figuring out how to do that
[11:10:02] <gordian> http://jsfiddle.net/kjJkR/
[11:10:10] <gordian> that's basically what i want
[11:10:18] <gordian> except the slide doesn't start at the right place
[11:10:36] <gordian> and it doesn't slide TO the right place
[11:10:42] <Bloomberg> .
[11:10:44] <gordian> and it resets after sliding
[11:22:04] <PsychoCarrot> http://pastebin.com/nJbBxi0k  <-- How do i go to another window when it counted down?
[11:24:04] <Al1> how do i add an extra hour to the second input: http://jsfiddle.net/albertpak/nMcm5/7/

[11:30:29] <PsychoCarrot> arkore How do i open a window when the countdown stops? http://pastebin.com/nJbBxi0k
[11:31:42] <arkore> PsychoCarrot, i dont know what countdown script you're using.  I imagine the script comes with API documentation that may offer/explain a feature for executing a function when timer ends, or at least executing a function for every interval of the timer
[11:56:49] <koulchilebaiz_> Hello, do you know why when the page loads, it starts with 'onMouseOver' and not with 'onMouseOut' ? http://pastebin.com/fb6CEtv3

[12:52:22] <rfk> Both the script inclusion and the inline initialization occur in <body> though. Is that a problem?
[12:53:15] <Voziv> rfk: as long as the script tag that does the initializaiton occurs after the script to include it
[12:53:34] <Voziv> Just in case, you cannot have <script src="blah.js">// code can't go in here</script>
[12:53:38] <rfk> Yeah, i've got that. Weird that it's saying undefined
[12:53:53] <rfk> yeah
[12:54:02] <Voziv> Any other errors? Could it be that you've tried to call it before inclusion?
[12:54:28] <rfk> Oh, my initialization script is of the form $(function () { tinymce.init({ ... }); }); // Do I need to use $.tinymce, or something of that sort?
[12:54:41] <rfk> I had just copied it from the main example page, not realizing that was the general case
[12:54:56] <rfk> No dice
[12:54:57] <Voziv> it might be that you need tinyMCE
[12:55:03] <Voziv> instead of tinymce
[12:55:07] <Voziv> http://www.tinymce.com/tryit/3_x/jquery_version.php
[12:55:22] <Voziv> other than that, I have no idea. and I'm off! good luck
[12:55:26] <rfk> Yeah, i'm using 4
[12:55:27] <rfk> http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/Installation
[12:55:57] <baordog> I pretty sure I have valid json, but when I call data.id it gives me "undefined"
[12:56:56] <grafi> show some code baordog
[12:56:57] <rfk> baordog: Does it come up in console.log?
[12:57:08] <baordog> that's what it says, that it's undefined
[12:57:19] <rfk> One time I had a JSON _string_ that showed up in console.log identically to an object
[12:57:48] <rfk> Is it the result of an AJAX request? is type: 'json' set, or whatever it is?
[12:58:15] <baordog> I notice my json is of the flavor where there is a key that nests everything
[12:58:49] <baordog> like... http://pastie.org/8222658 - perhaps data.id cannot overcome the first level of recursion?
[12:59:35] <baordog> of course data.data seems to fail as well
[13:00:55] <grafi> what does console.log(data) do?
[13:01:56] <baordog> it gives me the json that I just pastied
[13:02:18] <baordog> I also notice that if I add the argument to specify json as a data type I get nothing as well
[13:02:27] <rfk> baordog: And typeof data is object ?
[13:02:38] <baordog> what do you mean?
[13:03:03] <grafi> good idea rfk
[13:04:40] <rfk> baordog: Some time ago I was having the same trouble as you, and it turned out I was dealing with a JSON string rather than an actual object, as i mentioned above
[13:04:54] <baordog> ok, how do I deal with that?
[13:04:58] <rfk> No idea if this is the case with you, but it's worth a check (console.log(typeof data))
[13:05:42] <baordog> it's a string.
[13:05:44] <shoky> baordog: pastebin your ajax code
[13:05:57] <shoky> and try dataType: 'json'
[13:06:23] <baordog> where do I put that?
[13:06:32] <shoky> in the call to $.ajax
[13:06:49] <rfk> Where you have method, data, etc
[13:08:05] <baordog> rfk:  http://pastebin.com/K0DEPCbL
[13:08:28] <Cyclohexane> does anyone have any ideas how i could implement something like this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18154726/populate-the-list-without-uploading-anything
[13:08:31] <shoky> baordog: add   , 'json'  at the end
[13:09:05] <shoky> baordog:  $.post(url, {...}, function(data) { ... }, 'json')
[13:09:21] <baordog> I'll try again, but that always seems to crash it
[13:09:36] <shoky> baordog: if your server would return an "application/json" mime-type that'd be good too
[13:10:21] <baordog> http 500 :*
[13:10:23] <baordog> :(
[13:11:18] <Intii> Hi all. I'm having some trouble with some jQuery code...I have an anchor tag with an href of #BeWell but when I do this in code $('.case-study).attr('href') I only get "#" returned...what am I doing wrong?
[13:11:45] <shoky> baordog: wat
[13:12:13] <baordog> http 500, internal server error. It says that whenever it doesn't get the data it's expecting
[13:12:40] <shoky> what did you change
[13:12:56] <baordog> I added 'json' to the end
[13:13:01] <shoky> and what data is it getting..
[13:13:07] <NoiseEee> baordog: then check the backend/server side for errors
[13:13:22] <shoky> adding that 'json' shouldn't have any effect on what's sent to the server
[13:13:53] <baordog> Right, the server is getting the data fine (I can verify that), jquery just isn't getting a response
[13:14:01] <nhulea> Hi why would something like this not work ? http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/fHfxj/ it only seems to recognize the first value thnaks
[13:14:06] <baordog> Or, it doesn't consider my response valid
[13:14:06] <shoky> you said your server is spitting out a 500
[13:14:12] <shoky> that's your server, not jquery
[13:14:35] <baordog> No, that's just the error firebug gives me.
[13:14:44] <shoky> which is coming from your server
[13:15:05] <shoky> "internal server error" ..
[13:15:16] <nhulea> I am trying to get  it to loop thru thos possible values and then return the correct jquery
[13:15:20] <baordog> Well it does that anytime jquery doesn't give a response
[13:15:23] <nhulea> show or hide
[13:15:36] <shoky> jquery is not supposed to give any response
[13:15:38] <baordog> like it's saying "there must have been an error since the server didn't get back to us"
[13:15:41] <NoiseEee> baordog: jquery sends to server, server sends back to jquery as a response
[13:15:41] <baordog> *get not give
[13:15:43] <shoky> huh?
[13:15:45] <shoky> a 500 is a 500
[13:15:51] <NoiseEee> baordog: right there is a SERVER ERROR please to investigate
[13:16:38] <baordog> I did. The function is doing everything it's supposed. I'm watching my server, and it isn't throwing any errors. I've confirmed in the past that firefox behaves this way.
[13:16:47] <Intii> Can anyone please help?
[13:17:20] <shoky> baordog: that 500 cannot be coming from anything other than a server. unless your firefox has a bug..
[13:17:24] <baordog> I'm using a framework, so whenever my controller throws an error I get that instead of the json response. My window gets flooded with it.
[13:18:14] <grafi> Intii looks good, make a fiddle or give a link to live site so we can see some code
[13:18:29] <NoiseEee> baordog: guarantee you have a server error.
[13:18:44] <NoiseEee> baordog: fire up backend debugger etc, step through the code
[13:18:49] <baordog> Then why does it work fine when I don't specify 'json'?
[13:18:50] <nhulea> I just dont understand how to loop thru mulitple input values
[13:19:01] <nhulea> it seems like tis hould work
[13:19:20] <baordog> the error seems to be (as we established) that I have a json string and not an object.
[13:19:49] <grafi> baordog what about leaving 'json' off an making the response into a object yourself? $.parseJSON(data) ?
[13:19:58] <shoky> JSON.parse  parses a json string into an object. though i'd work on getting the server problem fixed
[13:20:16] <baordog> shoky:  What sort of server problem would behave that way?
[13:20:50] <nhulea>  if ($('select#select_grade_set_' + (this + 1)).val() == 'Pk-1' || 'K' || '1st') does something like this work or does it only pick up the 1st value
[13:20:51] <shoky> baordog: i don't know, you might have other code (or your framework does) that interferes with this, who knows
[13:22:06] <Intii> grafi: My code doesn't run in jsFiddle for some reason...
[13:22:21] <grafi> show the fiddle anyways
[13:22:45] <NoiseEee> nhulea: yeah, thats not valid JS right there
[13:23:16] <NoiseEee> nhulea: if(something!=somethingElse && something!=anotherThing && something!=yetAnotherThing) { //thats the way
[13:23:28] <Intii> grafi: Ahh I forgot to select jQuery it works now here is the link: http://jsfiddle.net/4U75D/
[13:23:29] <NoiseEee> s/&&/|| in your case
[13:23:54] <Intii> What its supposed to do is add the current-menu-item class to the li when I click next
[13:24:01] <baordog> I use cakephp I'm sure it's fine. Would it act this way if headers were left out?
[13:24:05] <nhulea> NoiseEee: thanks I will try that out
[13:24:45] <shoky> baordog: can you paste the ajax code that's causing a 500 error
[13:25:27] <shoky> and.. screenshot of your firebug network tab or somethin ;\  live link would be best
[13:25:43] <baordog> http://pastebin.com/v1XuQBs4
[13:30:38] <Intii> grafi: Do you have any idea why it's not working correctly?
[13:30:44] <grafi> Intii http://jsfiddle.net/4U75D/2/
[13:31:30] <Intii> What was i doing wrong?
[13:33:00] <initself> any idea why this empty of form data?
[13:33:00] <initself> $('#premiums').submit(function() { $(this).serialize() ); });
[13:33:02] <grafi> the if basically looks at the first menu link thingie and checks if it matches ... but you never check the others.
[13:33:17] <grafi> what i did now is selecting the right one, giving it the class
[13:33:23] <grafi> so the other way around
[13:33:44] <grafi> as you already know which one has to be the active one
[13:34:11] <Intii> ahhh! Thank you so much for your help sir!
[13:34:25] <grafi> no problem
[13:37:50] <baordog> shoky:  Thanks so much for your help, I figured it out.
[13:38:06] <delinquentme>             this.measurementList.settings = $.extend({},this.measurementList.defaults, options || {});
[13:38:39] <delinquentme> so this looks like its a statement copying the  "measurementList.defaults" to the settings of this table insance ... as well as including the curly brackets forrrrr ?
[13:39:22] <duch_kazatel> curly brackets are an empty object it looks like.
[13:41:07] <nhulea> NoiseEee: is this right ? http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/fHfxj/1/ thanks !
[13:42:00] <initself> two ids with the same name
[13:42:03] <initself> initself--
[13:42:59] <nhulea> I am getting an error that saying Uncaught ReferenceError: Invalid left-hand side in assignment
[13:43:13] <NoiseEee> initself: i'm not sure what it is you're trying to do
[13:45:02] <NoiseEee> but know that you shouldn't use "this" the way you are; if you're want the value of your array there, you want someting like http://jsfiddle.net/fHfxj/2/ to get you running
[13:46:29] <NoiseEee> nhulea: also there is a ton of optimization to be found within your code there.
[13:46:54] <nhulea> NoiseEee: cool yeah like what should I do ? thanks aagin
[13:47:11] <NoiseEee> well look at what i wrote, use the value of the array, not "this".
[13:47:22] <NoiseEee> nhulea: you should also probably familiarize yourself a bit more with javascript and jquery in general
[13:47:51] <NoiseEee> i'm not going to optimize for you, but instead of typing something like "$('select#select_grade_set_' + (this + 1)).val()" out four different times, assign that to a variable and write the variable 4 times.
[13:48:07] <NoiseEee> var x = $('select#select_grade_set_' + (this + 1)).val();  if(x!=='something' && x!='somethingElse') { //etc
[13:49:21] <nhulea> NoiseEee: thanks ok I get I will thanks
[14:12:44] <initself> NoiseEee: I'm good to go, yo!
[14:12:56] <NoiseEee> initself: nice

[14:14:47] <NoiseEee> initself: iirc thats sent as a 'cache buster'
[14:14:48] <duch_kazatel> 1: chill, 2. what's your problem?
[14:14:57] <initself> right, i remember that.
[14:15:11] <initself> why don't the docs for serialize talk about that, or am i missing it?
[14:15:30] <NoiseEee> isnt that coming via your xhr call and not serialize?
[14:15:40] <initself> oh, maybe that's right....
[14:15:43] <initself> NoiseEee++
[14:22:25] <Whirl3d> if I have a function that pops and object off an array, loads an image based on the object's info, then calls the same function again, will the function remember the object or will it forget it?
[14:22:47] <Whirl3d> ok, wow, sorry that sounds sketchy. Lemme make a jsbin.
[14:23:25] <pixelpimp> forget
[14:23:33] <pixelpimp> as you enter a new closure and thus a new scope
[14:32:48] <Whirl3d> I have a bunch of anchor elements that have graphic content that appears to lift up off the page when clicked.
[14:33:07] <Whirl3d> In order to accomplish this, I need to preload the images and remoe the link if the loader fails
[14:34:27] <Whirl3d> each link has two images, a source image and a shadow image. If either fails, I need to remove the original link. I have a sequential loader that I have built (and works great for the source image) but now I want to re-use it for the shadow
[14:35:58] <Whirl3d> Is there a preferred way to handle something like this?
[14:36:49] <sunbeam> does anyone know how I can get the old bootstrap template .zip that was there until recently?
[14:36:52] <sunbeam> That includes the /img/ files also
[14:37:51] <duch_kazatel> athat was "there"?
[14:40:32] <Whirl3d> try the way way back machine?
[14:41:11] <duch_kazatel> Wayback doesn't store zip files i don't think.
[14:41:15] <duch_kazatel> and rarely images.
[14:41:59] <grafi> the old bootstrap?
[14:43:40] <sunbeam> just like it was for years
[14:43:47] <sunbeam> until a month ago or something
[14:43:56] <sunbeam> when it included 4 .css files, an /img/ folder etc
[14:44:36] <duch_kazatel> bootstrap has updated many times over the years.
[14:45:55] <sunbeam> yes
[14:46:04] <sunbeam> but for example
[14:46:04] <grafi> http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/ ?!
[14:46:09] <pixelpimp> surely it's used some versioning software and you can just check out an old build?
[14:46:14] <sunbeam> their bare example, contains a file respond.js in the code
[14:46:17] <sunbeam> which isn't even included
[14:46:23] <sunbeam> yes
[14:46:48] <sunbeam> grafi: thats the version i mean yes
[14:46:51] <sunbeam> thanks
[14:47:04] <grafi> np
[14:50:18] <sunbeam> grafi: you code using bootstrap
[14:50:19] <sunbeam> ?
[14:50:35] <grafi> not excessively
[14:52:51] <duch_kazatel> bootstrap is great until you want to make a site.
[14:52:55] <duch_kazatel> *heyooo*
[14:53:01] <grafi> ^^
[14:53:30] <duch_kazatel> the last place i was at insisted on using bootstrap.  they're a failing company.
[14:54:09] <grafi> hm
[14:54:28] <grafi> "just slap bootstrap on it" kind of deal?
[14:54:51] <grafi> i mean there are some cool sites with bootstrap that dont look like bootstrap
[14:54:58] <duch_kazatel> nah build from the ground up.
[14:56:03] <utroda> Any familiar with backbone in here?
[14:56:18] <grafi> not me
[14:58:58] <sunbeam> grafi: ok
[14:59:54] <delinquentme> anyone in here sick mcnasty w datatables?
[15:00:12] <delinquentme> I'm wondering if a normal instantiation should include two tables ... one for the header elements ... and one for the actual table body
[15:00:16] <delinquentme> is this non-standard?
[15:06:04] <adsfasd> is append expensive?
[15:06:36] <snover> jquery is open source.
[15:06:45] <adsfasd> I added  		inner.append( c.name+" "+does[weapon.type]+" "+v.name+" for "+dmg+" damage" );  to my attack function and now my delay went from 200 ms to 1000
[15:07:48] <Al1> right now date2.toTimeString() outputs 09:15:00 GMT-0500 (CDT) - how can i display it as AM/PM format?
[15:10:32] <sunbeam> Bootstrap removed like most of their pages, customizing, examples, everything! :(
[15:10:35] <sunbeam> so annoying
[15:10:50] <Al1> how can i get rid of seconds and timezone display
[15:11:18] <Al1> @sunbeam getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/
[15:11:43] <duch_kazatel> adsfasd - append is cheap, but dom manipulation is expensive.
[15:11:51] <sunbeam> no more responsive css etc
[15:12:05] <sunbeam> Al1: sorry see it now
[15:12:06] <sunbeam> but
[15:12:13] <sunbeam> how come, any idea?
[15:12:37] <Al1> @sunbeam how come what?
[15:14:21] <sunbeam> Al1: they removed files, like responsive css
[15:14:51] <Al1> that im not sure
[15:21:02] <anew> is $(document).ready() necessary if u put all ur jq after the body tag?
[15:21:08] <anew> all the html is loaded so why would u need it ?
[15:22:17] <Enekoos> hello, how I can select all element from a <form>?
[15:26:04] <delinquentme> Enekoos, $('form#id').find('input')
[15:31:40] <Enekoos> thanks delinquentme i go to try, but need checkbox and textarea
[15:32:02] <Enekoos> can find('input textarea checkbox)?
[15:33:58] <Enekoos> or find('*') ?
[15:36:40] <dabear> Enekoos: find('input,textarea,checkbox, select') or find(":input")
[15:36:57] <Enekoos> thanks I go to try
[15:36:59] <duch_kazatel> Enekoos - why are you doing that, though?
[15:37:26] <dabear> oh, and button is an input too
[15:37:53] <Enekoos> duch_kazatel: I have form some validations, when incorrect put class and when new compare need remove al warning class
[15:38:51] <duch_kazatel> you should probably set unique ID's or target by name instead finding everything, in that case.
[15:38:52] <Enekoos> work fine dabear thanks
[15:39:27] <Enekoos> sure duch_kazatel can put 1 to 1 all element but try selects all in one linea more eficiencie
[15:58:42] <Toerkeium> hello guys
[15:59:39] <Toerkeium> I have a <div> with lots of <li>. How can I make so when I put the mouse over every <li> it gets highlighted with the ui-state-highlight jquery-ui css class?
[16:00:17] <Toerkeium> I added to that <div> $('#suggestionsList').addClass("ui-autocomplete ui-menu ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all");
[16:00:56] <Toerkeium> I've tried $('.ui-autocomplete li:hover').css("ui-state-highlight"); but it doesn't work
[16:01:54] <duch_kazatel> Toerkeium - check out the .hover() method.
[16:02:07] <Toerkeium> thanks duch_kazatel
[16:02:08] <Whirl3d> or duplicate a line of CSS
[16:02:49] <duch_kazatel> or do Whirl3d's solution.
[16:02:55] <Toerkeium> how would that be?
[16:03:08] <duch_kazatel> oh you're trying to add the class to the element.
[16:03:21] <Toerkeium> I just want to highlight it with the jquery class
[16:03:23] <duch_kazatel> i'm betting ui-state-highlight is a predetermined class from jquery ui.
[16:03:29] <Toerkeium> so if the theme is changed it keeps the theme style
[16:03:36] <Toerkeium> yes duch_kazatel
[16:03:43] <duch_kazatel> yup, then the hover method.
[16:03:56] <Toerkeium> thank you, reading
[16:05:23] <Whirl3d> do you add multiple classes using a space delimeter?  I figured you'd pass an array, but it makes sense....
[16:06:10] <duch_kazatel> hrm?  where, via the css method?
[16:06:36] <Whirl3d> $("#mydiv").addClass("two classes here";
[16:06:55] <Whirl3d> or three as it were...
[16:07:13] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[16:07:18] <duch_kazatel> space seperated list.
[16:07:28] <Toerkeium> yes I do it that way
[16:07:35] <Toerkeium> seems to be the correct way
[16:10:34] <Whirl3d> given a list of anchor elements, would I be best to use .map to grab a list of unique href attributes from them?
[16:15:30] <Toerkeium> $('li[id^="argv"]').mouseenter() is not triggering anything
[16:17:10] <Whirl3d> Toerkeium, try logging the length of your query to console and make sure you are selecting the right elements.
[16:17:14] <Toerkeium> it worked
[16:17:20] <Toerkeium> I was placing it in the wrong place
[16:17:27] <Toerkeium> I always do that!!
[16:19:22] <rakl> JSON.stringify(object) doesn't escape strings?
[16:20:20] <Toerkeium> thanks guys, have a good night
[16:26:09] <Whirl3d> you too. gnite
[16:28:23] <guzzlefry> Can anyone confirm that $.hover() doesn't work on <area> tags?
[16:29:41] <guzzlefry> oh wait, might help if I got the class names right.
[16:37:25] <henn1nk> https://gist.github.com/henn1nk/6198207 why isn't the class active added again to my object? line 6
[16:38:46] <duch_kazatel> pretty sure "childrens" isn't a method...
[16:38:59] <henn1nk> oh
[16:39:59] <henn1nk> duch_kazatel: but i would like to deactivate all other objects :/
[16:40:04] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:40:11] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle it pls :)
[16:40:23] <henn1nk> ok wait
[16:42:18] <nhulea> hey is there any reason this $.each() doesn't loop in this function it just stops after running one time  ? http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/pVyT8/
[16:46:02] <duch_kazatel> nhulea - use http://api.jquery.com/each/ instead.
[16:46:23] <duch_kazatel> $(someObject).each(function(index, Element){...})
[16:46:43] <nhulea> duch_kazatel: you think that will work?
[16:46:46] <nhulea> I will try it
[16:46:57] <duch_kazatel> that's just my cursory look at ti.
[16:46:59] <duch_kazatel> *it
[16:47:28] <nhulea> yeah its weird it was looping properly then it stopped
[16:47:53] <henn1nk> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/42tKB/
[16:48:05] <duch_kazatel> nhulea the version you were using is the lower-level method.  don't use those when you can avoid it :)
[16:48:14] <nhulea> oh ok
[16:48:42] <duch_kazatel> no henn1nk - what are you trying to accomplish with this?
[16:48:52] <henn1nk> http://jsfiddle.net/42tKB/
[16:48:58] <duch_kazatel> ... i see that.
[16:49:01] <duch_kazatel> what do you want to have happen?
[16:49:19] <henn1nk> duch_kazatel: clickin on the radio, i would like to show only the clicked radio and deactivate the section
[16:49:26] <duch_kazatel> Un... why?
[16:49:28] <henn1nk> this works
[16:49:39] <henn1nk> duch_kazatel: for a configurator
[16:49:51] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't make any sense, but okay.
[16:49:58] <duch_kazatel> so you want to pick one and hide all others.
[16:49:59] <duch_kazatel> that it?
[16:50:11] <henn1nk> right
[16:51:01] <duch_kazatel> and if I click a second time should it show?
[16:51:17] <henn1nk> duch_kazatel: only one element still, that is the problem :/
[16:51:30] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:51:38] <henn1nk> duch_kazatel: first click on one "BodyRadio"
[16:51:50] <henn1nk> than on "Title" and than again on another "BodyRadio"
[16:52:16] <henn1nk> the old one still is "activated" :/
[16:52:17] <duch_kazatel> oh, your first problem is everything hides?  that's partially because your html isn't valid.
[16:52:42] <henn1nk> not valid?
[16:52:49] <duch_kazatel>             <div class="object">
[16:52:49] <duch_kazatel>                 <input type="radio" />BodyRadio</div>
[16:52:52] <henn1nk> ops
[16:52:54] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't do what you want it to.
[16:53:29] <henn1nk> duch_kazatel: see my updated ver
[16:53:34] <henn1nk> http://jsfiddle.net/42tKB/1/
[16:54:30] <duch_kazatel> one sec, that's still not what you want
[16:54:37] <duch_kazatel> are you familiar with forms at all?
[16:54:46] <henn1nk> yes
[16:55:23] <henn1nk> duch_kazatel: this is just a short written test
[16:55:29] <henn1nk> for you
[16:55:31] <doug65536> why does stretching the right pane (making it wider) cause it to become too big vertically? http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/CtR4m/4/
[16:56:32] <duch_kazatel> henn1nk - your stuff still isn't set up to do what you intend.  one sec.
[16:56:47] <henn1nk> doug65536: two #ids?
[16:57:01] <henn1nk> doug65536: id="one" for 2 times.
[16:57:03] <doug65536> henn1nk: yes I know, see fiddle title :)
[16:57:11] <henn1nk> ah
[16:57:25] <doug65536> I was proving that $("#id") only finds first one, but css affects them all...
[16:57:39] <doug65536> then I got carried away with css and found that I can't make a split screen :)
[16:58:01] <nhulea> duch_kazatel: now I am getting an error Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Array] has no method 'apply'
[16:59:33] <duch_kazatel> okay so henn1nk - http://jsfiddle.net/gTx8F/
[16:59:51] <duch_kazatel> that first one is now formatted correctly. i was  getting different results depending on if I clicked the name vs. the radio.
[17:00:01] <duch_kazatel> that gets your markup looking a bit better for that first one.
[17:00:02] <duch_kazatel> make sense?
[17:00:33] <duch_kazatel> nhulea - fiddle link again?
[17:01:44] <henn1nk> doug65536: ok
[17:02:09] <henn1nk> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/gTx8F/1/
[17:02:19] <henn1nk> but the problem is still there :(
[17:02:25] <nhulea> http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/mtKM5/ duch_kazatel
[17:02:40] <duch_kazatel> henn1nk - lol i was trying to get you to update all the other buttons in a similar manner ;)
[17:02:56] <henn1nk> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/gTx8F/2/
[17:03:14] <henn1nk> this should be the "correct" version, but still the "error"
[17:04:05] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to say that you only want one radio "selectable" at a time?
[17:04:06] <henn1nk> duch_kazatel: you have to click at the radio itself at the moment, that is ok for this test
[17:04:16] <duch_kazatel> because if so, you need to set those up within a single form.
[17:04:35] <duch_kazatel> otherwise they're just sorta checkboxes you can't uncheck.
[17:04:40] <henn1nk> duch_kazatel: yes but all other not sellected radios shouldnt be displayed
[17:04:50] <henn1nk> duch_kazatel: see http://jsfiddle.net/gTx8F/2/ ..
[17:06:13] <nhulea> yeah I am not sure what the hell is going on or why it wont loop
[17:07:01] <duch_kazatel> henn1nk - yeah, you'll have to manually add the class on the click, then when you select the parent search of all children that have that class and remove it.
[17:07:16] <duch_kazatel> i can't do it for you atm but that should at least hopefully point you in the right directly.
[17:07:20] <henn1nk> duch_kazatel: don't i do this?
[17:07:50] <nhulea> ahh!
[17:08:12] <duch_kazatel> henn1nk - your code is formatted very strange for that
[17:09:25] <henn1nk> duch_kazatel: clicking on a radio i would like to hide all other radios and change the class of the title. clicking again on the title i would like to see all radios, clicking again on another radio the old clicked radio doesn"t get the active class removed! :(
[17:09:57] <nhulea> later gotta take off
[17:10:03] <nhulea> thanks duch_kazatel
[17:10:09] <nhulea> ttyl
[17:11:10] <duch_kazatel> henn1nk - ffs one sec then.
[17:11:24] <henn1nk> ffs?
[17:11:40] <snover> for fuck’s sake
[17:12:28] <duch_kazatel> can i add unique IDs to the other radios?
[17:12:44] <henn1nk> duch_kazatel: no
[17:13:09] <duch_kazatel> is there anything that makes each of these unique, then?
[17:13:26] <henn1nk> is there a need for this
[17:13:27] <henn1nk> ?
[17:13:32] <duch_kazatel> it makes it a hell of a lot easier.
[17:13:43] <henn1nk> but not so dynamic :P
[17:13:49] <duch_kazatel> wat
[17:14:01] <duch_kazatel> who cares?
[17:14:02] <henn1nk> but u can add an unique id to them
[17:14:15] <duch_kazatel> without knowing your scope, it's hard to really help.
[17:14:23] <duch_kazatel> i'll try without IDs I guess.
[17:14:40] <henn1nk> duch_kazatel: http://store.apple.com/us/configure/MD760LL/A?#presoftware something like this
[17:14:58] <henn1nk> duch_kazatel: (clicking on hardware vor example)
[17:15:11] <henn1nk> but with the change that the clicked radio is still displayed
[17:15:25] <duch_kazatel> clicking on hardware makes a specific area expand/contract.
[17:15:46] <henn1nk> duch_kazatel: this is "Title" in my example
[17:16:20] <duch_kazatel> bwuh i don't see how what you're doing is anything like that.
[17:16:51] <duch_kazatel> either way, one sec.
[17:23:03] <henn1nk> duch_kazatel: you can stop, i change this behaviour
[17:23:10] <henn1nk> that sucks :)
[17:27:30] <duch_kazatel> henn1nk - seriously your constraints don't make any sense and are sort of countr-intuitive.  i almost have it working./
[17:29:32] <duch_kazatel> not perfect, but does what you want: http://jsfiddle.net/KF3Qf/
[17:29:47] <duch_kazatel> very hacky - I reccomend using unique IDs in the backend to work against.
[17:30:10] <duch_kazatel> that way you can find, for instance, all inputs without that ID and hide.
[17:30:13] <duch_kazatel> etc.
[17:30:48] <duch_kazatel> if you're intending this for any sort of primetime, though, some other solution is smarter.
[17:32:32] <duch_kazatel> and with that, i go home.
[17:56:48] <initself> what gets me "change on type", so that when a user is typing into a box, it changes a value elsewhere?
[17:59:35] <initself> $('#someInput').bind('input', function() {
[17:59:44] <initself> StackOverflow++ # http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6458840/on-input-change-event
[18:00:21] <LoneSoldier728> hey I have a POST inception problem
[18:01:37] <LoneSoldier728> anyone know why when I call a post on a button inside a form
[18:01:45] <LoneSoldier728> it causes both the button and the form to post as well
[18:04:10] <shoky> LoneSoldier728: "call a post on a button" ?
[18:06:39] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[18:06:45] <LoneSoldier728> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18157626/post-inception-nodejs-mongo
[18:06:56] <LoneSoldier728> basically I have a remove field POST
[18:07:08] <LoneSoldier728> on a button that appears near each form item
[18:07:17] <LoneSoldier728> and I want to be able to remove the field (which does happen)
[18:07:45] <LoneSoldier728> however, it also causes the form to be posted(meaning the submit button on the form) gets posted
[18:07:45] <shoky> LoneSoldier728: probably the button is also submitting your form?
[18:07:59] <LoneSoldier728> I figured that, but how do I stop that from happening
[18:08:06] <shoky> LoneSoldier728: if that's the case you should handle the form 'submit' event, not the button click event. and preventDefault() the event
[18:08:36] <shoky> e.g. $('#myform').submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault();  $.post(...); })
[18:08:58] <LoneSoldier728> ah kk
[18:09:57] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[18:10:03] <LoneSoldier728> preventDefault() just broke it
[18:10:55] <LoneSoldier728> oh wait I am using it on the remove button
[18:10:57] <LoneSoldier728> not the form
[18:11:00] <LoneSoldier728> does it matter?
[18:11:29] <shoky> LoneSoldier728: or if that button is not supposed to submit the form at all,
[18:11:39] <shoky> LoneSoldier728:  put  type="button"  on the <button>
[18:12:13] <shoky> LoneSoldier728: and yes that would matter. but i guess you don't want a form submit here at all
[18:12:45] <shoky> so try leaving it the way you had it,  just add type="button"
[18:13:10] <LoneSoldier728> I just tried type button
[18:13:15] <LoneSoldier728> it doesnt work
[18:13:25] <LoneSoldier728> it doesnt let the click event occur
[18:13:37] <LoneSoldier728> or should i do button=type
[18:13:40] <LoneSoldier728> and also have
[18:13:45] <LoneSoldier728> preventDefault too
[18:13:50] <shoky> doesnt let the click occur?
[18:13:59] <shoky> leave it how you had it before, no preventDefault
[18:14:41] <LoneSoldier728> ya I tried that andthe button is clickable but no action takes place
[18:15:12] <shoky> the $.post doesnt happen..?  i'd need to see this live to know whats going on
[18:16:18] <LoneSoldier728> ok it does post
[18:16:21] <LoneSoldier728> just nothing happens?
[18:16:40] <LoneSoldier728> oh it removes is just that
[18:16:53] <LoneSoldier728> the jade form still has it as an input
[18:16:56] <LoneSoldier728> until you leave the page
[18:17:08] <LoneSoldier728> and also, it does not allow you to add multiple emails after that
[18:17:17] <shoky> whatever
[18:17:23] <LoneSoldier728> let me try
[18:17:25] <LoneSoldier728> one more thing
[18:17:57] <LoneSoldier728> ya it removes it is just not
[18:18:15] <LoneSoldier728> reloading the page correctly
[18:18:20] <LoneSoldier728> oh hold up
[18:18:22] <LoneSoldier728> thank u
[18:19:10] <LoneSoldier728> ah dam no it is not working : /
[18:47:12] <LoneSoldier728> hey
[18:47:17] <LoneSoldier728> shoky
[18:47:23] <LoneSoldier728> so your answer was helpful
[18:47:40] <LoneSoldier728> but the problem I am having is it is not redirecting even tho it calls a get and responds with a 304
[18:50:11] <shoky> 304 isn't a redirect, i think
[18:51:34] <LoneSoldier728> 304 i think is cache
[18:58:44] <doug65536> 304 means "didn't bother downloading it, cache is up to date"
[18:59:16] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: ^
[18:59:40] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[18:59:44] <LoneSoldier728> so what is the problem
[19:00:17] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: I just got here. it's a form submission?
[19:00:34] <LoneSoldier728> basically everything is working
[19:00:49] <LoneSoldier728> except for the fact that after the removal happens I want to refresh the page or show that it occured
[19:01:00] <LoneSoldier728> I guess I can call for it to be removed through jquery actually
[19:01:54] <doug65536> GET forms (the default without method="POST") can be cached
[19:02:25] <doug65536> meaning it won't actually go through with the "submit" - it will use cached response from last time
[19:03:25] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: I can't find a fiddle or code sample. did you post one to IRC?
[19:04:59] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: that means that you almost *always* have to use POST for forms
[19:05:14] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: I haven't ever seen a sceanrio where you don't have to use POST
[19:05:19] <LoneSoldier728> here
[19:05:36] <LoneSoldier728> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18157626/get-not-redirecting-the-page-nodejs-mongo/18157772?noredirect=1#comment26598505_18157772
[19:05:52] <LoneSoldier728> basically
[19:06:01] <LoneSoldier728> I am doing a post
[19:06:06] <LoneSoldier728> but the get is not occuring
[19:06:30] <doug65536> what is the html for the <form> tag?
[19:06:39] <LoneSoldier728> it is a button
[19:06:41] <LoneSoldier728> that is posting
[19:06:42] <doug65536> just the opening <form ...this stuff...>
[19:06:43] <LoneSoldier728> not the form
[19:07:13] <doug65536> none of that code does ajax or posts or has anything to do with your problem
[19:07:21] <gordian> guys i've setup a very basic jQuery slideshow here: http://jsfiddle.net/8Hgpv/
[19:07:27] <LoneSoldier728> the script
[19:07:41] <gordian> while it autoslides i'd like to be able to click one of the buttons and have it go to that slide and then stop auto sliding
[19:07:52] <LoneSoldier728> hold on i am trying something
[19:08:00] <gordian> not sure i'm cycling through slides the best way for that
[19:08:09] <gordian> any help/guidance would be greatly appreciated
[19:10:13] <doug65536> gordian: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8Hgpv/1/
[19:10:56] <doug65536> gordian: better: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8Hgpv/2/
[19:12:00] <doug65536> gordian: better: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8Hgpv/4/
[19:13:09] <doug65536> gordian: the disabling of the buttons is not nice imho
[19:19:25] <alexwaters> I am trying to use toolbar.js - https://github.com/paulkinzett/toolbar but when I change any of the option hrefs from # to an actual link nothing happens when the link is clicked. I am in chrome on OSX. Even when I do it in the reference implementation... if you change line 399 here: http://paulkinzett.github.io/toolbar/ you can see it live
[19:19:41] <alexwaters> anyone know how I can have links work? I'm assuming there's a JS tweak that needs to happen
[19:20:31] <doug65536> alexwaters: I think this is your problem: https://github.com/paulkinzett/toolbar/blob/master/jquery.toolbar.js#L56
[19:21:13] <doug65536> alexwaters: try commenting it out and testing just your real link...
[19:21:20] <doug65536> if that works then I can suggest a real fix
[19:22:17] <LoneSoldier728> hm ya not working the way I thought
[19:22:41] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/pcdFZxeX
[19:22:43] <LoneSoldier728> is that correct
[19:22:47] <LoneSoldier728> for removing the field
[19:22:54] <LoneSoldier728> it removes the button but the field is still there
[19:23:00] <alexwaters> doug65536: that did not fix it :(
[19:23:30] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: 'this' refers to the button
[19:23:34] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: what is .userE
[19:23:43] <LoneSoldier728> it is a class
[19:23:46] <LoneSoldier728> i added to the input field
[19:23:56] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: some reason you won't show more? people can view source you know
[19:24:10] <LoneSoldier728> oh wait
[19:24:13] <LoneSoldier728> it wont work
[19:24:18] <LoneSoldier728> because it is being replaced
[19:24:26] <LoneSoldier728> hm how do i remove a field actually
[19:24:39] <LoneSoldier728> that has the button next to it
[19:24:47] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: can't tell you. you won't show the html
[19:24:52] <LoneSoldier728> oh sorry here
[19:24:53] <LoneSoldier728> it is jade
[19:25:08] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/cz56VhvH
[19:25:16] <LoneSoldier728> tell me if u dont understand something
[19:25:58] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: remove the div?
[19:26:15] <LoneSoldier728> which
[19:26:21] <LoneSoldier728> and it doesnt affect anything anyways
[19:26:22] <doug65536> how far "up" do you want to remove?
[19:26:34] <doug65536> the form, the div, the whole row, etc
[19:27:06] <LoneSoldier728> i want to just remove
[19:27:08] <LoneSoldier728> input
[19:27:16] <LoneSoldier728> under the for userE in uemailList
[19:27:34] <alexwaters> i will give .2 bitcoins to anyone who can help me solve that toolbar.js problem :P
[19:27:54] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: ok, then $(this).closest('form').find('.userE').remove();
[19:28:14] <LoneSoldier728> ah ok
[19:29:46] <gordian> doug65536: thanks but the slider stops after it gets to the last slide
[19:29:51] <doug65536> alexwaters: is there a website up where I can go debug it?
[19:29:55] <gordian> in the last link
[19:30:01] <gordian> didn't look at the others yet
[19:30:08] <LoneSoldier728> wait
[19:30:17] <LoneSoldier728> i am trying to remove
[19:30:19] <alexwaters> doug65536: yes the problem can be seen here: http://localhost/NoNonsenseForum/toolbar/documentation/index.html
[19:30:20] <LoneSoldier728> the closest input
[19:30:22] <alexwaters> oops
[19:30:31] <LoneSoldier728> to the this*
[19:30:35] <LoneSoldier728> so is it just this
[19:30:40] <gordian> doug65536: looks like it stops after the last slide in all of those fiddles
[19:30:40] <alexwaters> i mean http://paulkinzett.github.io/toolbar/
[19:30:40] <LoneSoldier728> $(this).closest('input').remove();
[19:30:41] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: closest searches up the element tree
[19:30:48] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: no
[19:30:55] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: ok, then $(this).closest('form').find('input').remove();
[19:31:12] <doug65536> gordian: and yours doesn't?
[19:31:18] <LoneSoldier728> but would it find the first input
[19:31:22] <LoneSoldier728> in the form
[19:31:30] <LoneSoldier728> because it is a couple inputs down
[19:32:00] <LoneSoldier728> nope
[19:32:03] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: is there a class on that "couple of inputs down" or some way to identify it? you are still keeping secrets
[19:32:03] <LoneSoldier728> that removes the whole form
[19:32:12] <alexwaters> doug65536: if you go to that link and click on the first modal menu and click on any of the items you can see that the page does not load http://paulkinzett.github.io/toolbar/# like it should - it just sits on the current URI
[19:32:26] <LoneSoldier728> ha there isnt except for it's position in the array
[19:32:53] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: well add a class for that
[19:33:18] <doug65536> <input class="removeMeOnPost ...other existing classes..." ...
[19:33:21] <LoneSoldier728> well the thing is
[19:33:32] <doug65536> then find('.removeMeOnPost').remove()
[19:33:32] <LoneSoldier728> it is the closest input
[19:33:35] <LoneSoldier728> to this
[19:33:54] <doug65536> it isn't the closest input. 'closest' means search up the parents
[19:33:59] <LoneSoldier728> right
[19:34:01] <LoneSoldier728> what is next
[19:34:22] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: add a class to the input field you want to remove. why screw around?
[19:34:47] <LoneSoldier728> because I cannot focus a class
[19:34:53] <LoneSoldier728> since it is being created thru a loop
[19:34:57] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: what is the name= on it?
[19:34:58] <LoneSoldier728> idk how to identify it
[19:35:15] <LoneSoldier728> it is being rendered sserver side
[19:35:18] <LoneSoldier728> then looped thru
[19:35:29] <LoneSoldier728> and prints out an input field for each item in the array
[19:36:56] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: newEmail?
[19:37:01] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: which field?
[19:37:37] <LoneSoldier728> it will remove all the newEmail tho
[19:37:40] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: tell me which field or get someone else to help you. I can't be bothered
[19:38:15] <doug65536> alexwaters: that's not your site with a toolbar link that goes to another page
[19:38:17] <LoneSoldier728> ok
[19:39:48] <LoneSoldier728> If someone hits the delete button aka called X in my example it removes it from the db, I want to remove it from jquery at the same time as well.... However, I do not know how to classify it by a separate class since they all have the same identifiers exacept for the value
[19:39:52] <LoneSoldier728> except
[19:40:52] <alexwaters> doug65536: http://paulkinzett.github.io/toolbar/ is not my site - but you can see the same issue I am experiencing there
[19:40:53] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: I'll be vague like you. call: $(this).nearest('div'). < call something here >
[19:41:02] <LoneSoldier728> nearest works?
[19:41:11] <LoneSoldier728> i just need to remove the nearest input
[19:41:33] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: I'll ask one more time, what is the name= on that field?
[19:41:45] <LoneSoldier728> oh ok sorry newEmail
[19:41:50] <alexwaters> doug65536: if you click on one of the buttons that appears from the example menus, you will see that they do not append a # to the address bar as they should
[19:42:02] <LoneSoldier728> $(this).closest('input').remove();
[19:42:04] <LoneSoldier728> oops
[19:42:05] <gordian> doug65536: no, my original does not stop
[19:42:07] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/cz56VhvH
[19:42:09] <gordian> it keeps cycling
[19:42:13] <gordian> http://jsfiddle.net/8Hgpv/
[19:42:14] <Whirl3d> Hey all. If I use var el=$("<div class='inageHolder'><img src='validurl'/><img src='validurl'/></div>").appendTo(other); will it go ahead and load the images?
[19:42:15] <LoneSoldier728> line 15
[19:42:20] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: $(this).closest('div').find('input[name="newEmail"]').remove()
[19:43:10] <LoneSoldier728> ah it removes all 3 of the inputs
[19:43:12] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: assuming there is one input field in the innermost div
[19:43:23] <doug65536> is each one in a separate field?
[19:43:31] <LoneSoldier728> yeah it makes duplicates
[19:43:37] <doug65536> I mean, separate form
[19:43:40] <LoneSoldier728> of the input with the value just changing
[19:44:02] <LoneSoldier728> so all of them will be newEmail
[19:44:13] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: $(this).parent().find('input[name="newEmail"]').remove()
[19:45:18] <LoneSoldier728> yeah still removes all the inputs
[19:45:22] <doug65536> alexwaters: what I wanted to do was break into the code with a debugger and see where it goes to find why clicks don't work
[19:45:29] <LoneSoldier728> the newEmail is going to be the name
[19:45:35] <LoneSoldier728> for all the additional emails
[19:45:40] <LoneSoldier728> so if someone has 2 or more
[19:45:46] <LoneSoldier728> that will remove them both +
[19:46:21] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: so you have a single form with a bunch of inputs with the same name and they are all at the same point in the hierarchy? bad page
[19:46:32] <alexwaters> doug65536: hmm - sorry I haven't really messed with it other than downloading and fiddling with the reference implementation
[19:46:33] <LoneSoldier728> correct
[19:46:43] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: then don't do that
[19:46:59] <LoneSoldier728> another solution is to reload the page but that was not working
[19:47:10] <LoneSoldier728> and I figured it would be more seamless to just remove it from the page
[19:47:24] <LoneSoldier728> because it does get removed from the db
[19:47:26] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: no, the solution is to change the html so it's not stupid
[19:47:35] <LoneSoldier728> ok how would I change it then
[19:48:12] <doug65536> can you view source on an actual page and copy a big chunk of html to a pastebin?
[19:48:21] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[19:48:25] <doug65536> I'm sure I can figure out a way to uniquely identify the input
[19:48:30] <LoneSoldier728> thanks btw
[19:50:22] <doug65536> alexwaters: well, somewhere it is calling event.preventDefault(). at that point, you should wrap an if around it that does if($(this).attr('href')!=='#') { event.preventDefault(); }
[19:50:28] <doug65536> alexwaters: that's my best guess
[19:50:54] <alexwaters> doug65536: ok awesome, thank you so much
[19:51:29] <doug65536> alexwaters: or just attach your own click handler to just that item and do location.href = $(this).attr('href');
[19:51:33] <LoneSoldier728> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6198817
[19:51:40] <LoneSoldier728> here I tried to copy the whole form
[19:51:55] <alexwaters> doug65536: cool I will try that, thank you
[19:51:58] <LoneSoldier728> the form should be wrapping it
[19:52:37] <LoneSoldier728> everything
[19:52:38] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: $(this).prev().remove()
[19:53:13] <doug65536> perhaps .prev('input')
[19:53:45] <LoneSoldier728> ok great
[19:53:48] <LoneSoldier728> that worked
[19:53:52] <LoneSoldier728> what is .prev?
[19:54:09] <LoneSoldier728> oh ok previous
[19:54:10] <doug65536> means, look at this same level of the tree for elements matching the selector
[19:54:12] <LoneSoldier728> great that worked
[19:54:17] <doug65536> won't walk into parents, etc
[19:54:22] <LoneSoldier728> ight
[19:54:38] <alexwaters> doug65536: that location.href worked!
[19:54:44] <alexwaters> doug65536: alright to PM?
[19:54:47] <doug65536> alexwaters: sure
[19:56:29] <LoneSoldier728> thanks
[19:57:38] <doug65536> LoneSoldier728: np
[20:00:43] <doug65536> gordian: having another look...
[20:00:51] <gordian> cool
[20:03:16] <Whirl3d> $("img.myClass").on({load:loadHander, error:errorHandler}), what gets passed to loadHandler ? the Image element or the query object? and to what does $(this) refer inside the loadHandler function?
[20:03:33] <doug65536> gordian: I see the problem...
[20:09:37] <doug65536> gordian: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8Hgpv/8/
[20:10:49] <gordian> doug65536: that's definitely closer
[20:11:03] <doug65536> gordian: what isn't right?
[20:11:05] <gordian> but basically the buttons need to act live nav bullets on other popular sliders
[20:11:11] <gordian> when you click one it goes to that slide
[20:11:27] <gordian> the difference is that when you click one the auto interval stops completely
[20:11:36] <gordian> no cycles after clicking a button
[20:11:56] <gordian> does that make more sense?
[20:12:41] <gordian> it might be tough to break the interval on click because the interval is actually clicking each time to cycle the slider
[20:13:00] <gordian> that's why i said i might not be cycling the best way possible
[20:13:24] <gordian> but not sure how else to do it without writing a good bit more code
[20:17:04] <javalover> anyone in here?
[20:17:45] <joker_89> hi i use ajax response and i get truncated at line 10.000
[20:17:59] <javalover> yeah only so much memory allowed joker
[20:18:15] <javalover> are you sure you're doing a proper call? and not looping to inifinity?
[20:18:33] <joker_89> no
[20:18:38] <joker_89> only fails in one server
[20:18:45] <joker_89> and it truncat at line 10.000 exactly
[20:20:00] <javalover> could be the number that the memory fills at
[20:20:29] <javalover> or perhaps I don't know what truncated means....
[20:21:11] <joker_89> it returns only text, and if i copy the text in notepad++ says 10000 lines
[20:21:15] <joker_89> always the same
[20:48:54] <jdeisenberg> I believe I've found a problem with select menus in a dialog box, using Chrome on Windows.
[20:49:18] <grafi> whats the problem oô
[20:49:59] <jdeisenberg> I have pre-selected an item about 3/4 down the list, and no matter how you scroll, that selected item always is at the bottom of the drop-down list;
[20:50:07] <jdeisenberg> you can't scroll all the way to the top. Arrow keys don't work either.
[20:50:24] <jdeisenberg> I have a test case.
[20:50:36] <jdeisenberg> Can I put it in jsbin even if it includes <script> elements?
[20:55:57] <grafi> probably
[20:57:52] <gordian> doug65536: cleaned it up a bit: http://jsfiddle.net/8Hgpv/9/
[20:58:14] <gordian> it doesn't trigger('click') for the auto cycle now
[20:58:42] <gordian> so now when there actually is a click on a button i'd like it to go to that image and STOP auto cycling completely
[20:58:53] <doug65536> gordian: not sure putting a function in global scope is cleaner, but yes it is more readable
[20:59:11] <gordian> not sure how to kill the interval dead in it's tracks without it finishing the current iteration
[20:59:33] <gordian> doug65536: where should i put that function then?
[20:59:40] <doug65536> gordian: that statement doesn't make sense - it isn't multithreaded. if you are running code, the interval isn't running code
[20:59:56] <doug65536> like I did, var name = function() { ... };
[20:59:59] <doug65536> inside $()
[21:00:02] <doug65536> is ideal
[21:00:10] <gordian> wait, huh?
[21:00:19] <gordian> that's where i should put the Slide() function?
[21:00:33] <doug65536> that would protect it from some other code clobbering it yes
[21:00:40] <doug65536> and it would not pollute global scope
[21:00:41] <LoneSoldier728> can I call this
[21:00:46] <LoneSoldier728> $addToSet: {socialAccounts: {req.body.socialAccount :  req.body.socialAccountNew}}
[21:00:46] <LoneSoldier728> 		
[21:01:00] <LoneSoldier728> or is two req.body not allowed
[21:01:13] <gordian> doug65536: but i need to call Slide() when the button gets clicked
[21:01:26] <doug65536> gordian: the reason is, if some other library or code does Slide = 2;   your function is toast
[21:01:27] <gordian> …when any button is clicked
[21:02:26] <gordian> ohh i see what you did
[21:02:28] <gordian> makes sense
[21:02:51] <doug65536> it's weird but worth doing, and standard procedure for good js code
[21:04:23] <LoneSoldier728> ok let me ask a better question... So I want users to be able to choose a social network for example facebook or twitter and based on it the value is eitehr fb or twit, then I want to also store the value for the input of what they enter
[21:04:49] <jdeisenberg> OK; thanks!
[21:04:52] <LoneSoldier728> currently I am doing it by using select and options and based on the optionsI am showing them and input field to add
[21:05:59] <grafi> how does that relate to your first question?
[21:07:17] <LoneSoldier728> what the $addToSet one?
[21:08:25] <gordian> doug65536: http://jsfiddle.net/8Hgpv/10/
[21:08:26] <gordian> better?
[21:08:32] <gordian> also, check out line 20
[21:09:09] <doug65536> gordian: yes, it's better
[21:13:01] <doug65536> gordian: so is that ok or is there still a problem?
[21:13:40] <doug65536> gordian: you want to cancel the animation or something?
[21:14:51] <gordian> precisely
[21:15:56] <doug65536> save the return value from the animate call, and where you want to kill the current animation, call .abort() on it
[21:16:46] <gordian> hmm, not clear on what you mean by "save the return value from the animate call"
[21:18:29] <T13|sleeps> Hi.
[21:18:52] <doug65536> gordian: .animate returns something. store it
[21:19:45] <T13|sleeps> Pretty full room.
[21:19:55] <gordian> doug65536: how?
[21:20:33] <gordian> and also there are two animation calls–one in and one out
[21:20:50] <gordian> apologies for being such a noob
[21:20:56] <gordian> trying my best to learn this stuff
[21:25:21] <EvilNo0B> Hello, can someone tell me what tutorial should i look for ? For example i have 3 categories , each category has 5 buttons inside , they are the same but diff category . The categories are working with "Accordion" . Once they pick one they just see this category info and have like 5 edit buttons for different things .
[21:25:21] <EvilNo0B> Now what i want is to slide it down inside that accordion on click on one of the buttons , basically load div on click .  any ideas what i am looking for ? :S
[21:26:01] <gordian> EvilNo0B: if you want help with that i recommend you post an example on http://jsfiddle.net
[21:26:32] <EvilNo0B> gordian: gimme a minute
[21:28:37] * gordian hands EvilNo0B a minute
[21:29:16] * T13|sleeps steals it, but falls asleep.
[21:29:24] * gordian steals it back
[21:29:29] <Whirl3d> What is the easiest way to get a list of unique anchor href attributes?
[21:29:58] <gordian> Whirl3d: $.each()
[21:30:19] <gordian> if that doesn't help then you may need to explain what you want to do in more detail
[21:30:23] <gordian> or post an example
[21:33:00] <Whirl3d> .eval ("#someting'.substr(1));
[21:33:07] <Whirl3d> dang. wrong window...sry
[21:36:51] <EvilNo0B> gordian : http://jsfiddle.net/54gdC/ what i want is to slide it down inside that accordion on click on one of the buttons
[21:38:27] <gordian> EvilNo0B: looks like that's what happens
[21:38:31] <gordian> what am i missing?
[21:38:44] <EvilNo0B> well now u see the links inside each accordion?
[21:39:11] <EvilNo0B> i need it to slide down another content inside the accordion in case somebody clicks for example on edit url
[21:39:48] <gordian> but there's nothing there to slide down
[21:40:01] <EvilNo0B> ok lemme edit it i'll show ya what i mean
[21:44:38] <EvilNo0B> gordian: http://jsfiddle.net/54gdC/1/ here , now u see that hidden divs? i need to load them somehow on click on the buttons inside the accordion ,
[21:45:58] <EvilNo0B> but the thing is that every accordion content will have buttons like that inside too :S maybe a diff number at the end to avoid mixup
[21:47:06] <EvilNo0B> or maybe it should somehow depend on the div , so it would load one of the nearst divs dunno :S
[21:49:41] <LoneSoldier728> ok is there a way to send a req.body.whatever as a variale back?
[21:49:43] <LoneSoldier728> in a POST
[21:51:05] <LoneSoldier728> nvm got it
[23:50:35] <zeropx> How would I bind a click event when I need to call a method using this.mymethodname() but from inside another method. Kind of an example http://jsbin.com/eqacog/3/edit
