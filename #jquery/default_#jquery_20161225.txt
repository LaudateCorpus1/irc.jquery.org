[22:27:13] <EGreg> hey all
[22:27:19] <EGreg> why use .prop('foo') instead of [0].foo ?
[22:27:22] <EGreg> is it ever different?!?
[22:44:19] <systemfault> The first way is using jQuery, the second unwraps the jQuery object into a DOM node and access the property
[22:46:24] <arc_> there are frequently multiple ways of doing something in programming
[22:46:41] <arc_> using .prop there just makes the code more readable
