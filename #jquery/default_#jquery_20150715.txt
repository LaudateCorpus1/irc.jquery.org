[00:04:17] <hellyeah> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/rodtd7wz/1/ event is not fired in the page load can i use https://api.jquery.com/load-event/ instead of document.on pls take a look at line 188-203
[00:17:05] <SimbaLion`> http://jsfiddle.net/SimbaLion/xvchqphd/30/ When you hit 'enter' while focused on one of the price fields, it adds a new line after that row, which is great. However, the 'remove' button seems to be oddly placed, and if you click the remove button it deletes all the rows. I think this is because I'm using a non-unique class. But shouldn't $(this) only apply to the anchor clicked, and not other
[00:17:05] <SimbaLion`> anchors that happen to have the same class?
[00:25:27] <Cork> SimbaLion`: $(this).closest('p').after();
[00:25:46] <Cork> instead of insertAfter(this)
[00:26:14] <Cork> remove breaks cause you add all new rows as children of the current row
[00:32:14] <op> how to get access_token to secret groups of facebook, please?
[00:32:26] <SimbaLion`> Cork, Thanks!!
[00:33:03] <SimbaLion`> I thought insertAfter was adding them as siblings, not children
[00:33:07] <SimbaLion`> confusing..
[00:37:49] <d3m0n> WHy's there like a weird jump at the end of the slideDown animation to the animated element? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/QbxBjX
[00:37:57] <d3m0n> Pushed up
[00:44:07] <prohobo> d3m0n: the first <p> has an offset during the anim
[00:44:25] <prohobo> have no idea how to fix it though
[00:44:28] <d3m0n> prohobo: Why's that? It's just default styling
[00:45:01] <prohobo> no clue
[00:45:24] <d3m0n> Oh
[00:45:30] <d3m0n> It looks like it was the margin collpasing
[00:46:01] <ssMd> hi can i use bootstrap .validator or .bootstrapValidator with a class, rather than a input name?
[00:48:38] <Cork> d3m0n: also js can't modify :before
[00:48:50] <Cork> so your :before selector has no effect
[00:48:57] <d3m0n> ... yep ...
[00:48:58] <d3m0n> hahaha
[00:49:03] <d3m0n> Was trying to figure out why
[00:49:50] <d3m0n> Seems like that would or should totally work
[00:50:24] <op> how to get access_token to secret groups of facebook, please?
[00:52:24] <Cork> d3m0n: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/doKjNd
[00:52:28] <Cork> is one option
[00:52:34] <Cork> another option is to use a class on the element
[00:52:41] <Cork> i would recommend using a class
[00:52:51] <d3m0n> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/QbxBjX
[00:52:52] <d3m0n> :)
[00:53:01] <Cork> cause then you can just do .toggleClass('collapsed')
[00:53:04] <d3m0n> That's an interesting way though you did
[01:56:05] <krambiorix> hi, i want to select all emailaddresses but not the ones in a mailto="" attribute ...https://jsfiddle.net/gm5vonb3/
[02:00:01] <ssMd> krambiorix you want to select all the email addresses from where?
[02:00:16] <krambiorix> ssMd in the .row div
[02:00:54] <ssMd> https://jsfiddle.net/gm5vonb3/1/
[02:03:01] <ssMd> it should work
[02:04:53] <krambiorix> ssMd, thanks but it doesn't work on my computer... The row has multiple children other than emailaddressess
[02:05:29] <ssMd> then add a class to the anchor tag
[02:05:36] <ssMd> and add that class as a filter
[02:09:38] <krambiorix> ssMd, the content of the row div is coming from a cms... I can't change that
[02:10:17] <jak2000> krambiorix hi friend, you used ajax for retreive data from a url?
[02:10:27] <jak2000> from a page that query to a db?
[02:11:06] <krambiorix> jak2000, nope, the html exists already
[02:12:10] <jak2000> mmm i know this: http://www.tizag.com/ajaxTutorial/ajaxxmlhttprequest.php
[02:12:12] <jak2000> check please
[02:12:43] <jak2000> if(ajaxRequest.readyState == 4){ document.myForm.time.value = ajaxRequest.responseText; } and the php code is:
[02:12:51] <jak2000> http://www.tizag.com/ajaxTutorial/ajaxphp.php
[02:13:16] <jak2000> if you see only do a echo, right? at this time i am ok, and  understand, but what happend if i need modify 3 input texts?
[02:13:17] <krambiorix> jak2000, thank but i just want to replace the emailaddesses which aren't in an attribute
[02:13:24] <jak2000> ok
[02:18:09] <mark-use> I make a ajax POST call, get a JSON response, process it, generate html and use $('#result_box').empty().append(myhtml);
[02:18:09] <mark-use> mostly the first time you click the button, the content wont be loaded into div, BUT a alert(myhtml); just one line above shows that myhtml var got the content loaded...what could cause that?
[02:19:19] <Cork> mark-use: just a side note
[02:19:25] <Cork> just use .html(myhtml)
[02:19:32] <Cork> no need for .empty() + append
[02:19:42] <mark-use> Cork: well that I had before...
[02:20:20] <mark-use> Cork: and well, I rather use .empty().append(), as it prety sure is a bit faster...
[02:20:36] <Cork> mark-use: no it isn't
[02:20:40] <Cork> cause you run the same code
[02:21:03] <mark-use> Cork: the .html() wont do anything else, but has a few checks before( as you could also read data with .html()
[02:21:03] <mark-use> ...or am I wrong?
[02:21:27] <Cork> no, .html doesn't read data
[02:21:41] <Cork> the same check .html does is done by .append
[02:21:55] <mark-use> anyway, what can cause that the content does not get loaded into <div>
[02:21:55] <Cork> as both can take jquery objects, dom elements and html
[02:22:15] <Cork> well to start with never debug with alert
[02:22:20] <mark-use> Cork: sure it does, just forget it.... myhtml = $('#mydiv').html();
[02:22:27] <Cork> it makes the engine to crazy stuff
[02:22:40] <Cork> so check with console.log instead
[02:22:44] <mark-use> Cork: please, chill down, you are not helping
[02:22:57] <Cork> mark-use: that is just an if check for if arguments.length > 0
[02:23:00] <mark-use> done that, variable got propper content
[02:23:03] <Cork> and a elm.innerHTML
[02:24:02] <Cork> mark-use: i'm perfectly "chill"
[02:24:11] <Cork> i'm just commenting on things
[02:24:32] <Cork> what does console.log($('#result_box').length) give you?
[02:27:09] <mark-use> console.log($('#result_box').length)  --> 1
[02:35:21] <d3m0n> How can I run text() function on a variable? Is it possible?
[02:35:35] <d3m0n> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/BNVPvB
[02:36:29] <d3m0n> Trying to strip the tags
[02:38:04] <Cork> d3m0n: $('<div>').html(var).text()
[02:39:34] <d3m0n> Cork: I am afriad I dont follow
[02:39:55] <Cork> uh... what aren't you following?
[02:40:17] <d3m0n> What var is var in your example and why did you put a selector that includes less than and greater than tag?
[02:40:38] <Cork> your "variable"
[02:40:51] <Cork> and it isn't a select
[02:41:12] <Cork> $('<div>') is a short for $(document.createElement('div'))
[02:41:33] <d3m0n> Ohhh I see, so youre creating a div, putting the html and grabbing the text
[02:43:07] <d3m0n> Cork: log still shows html tags http://codepen.io/anon/pen/BNVPvB
[02:43:28] <Cork> ya, cause you're moving the text element
[02:43:31] <Cork> not the content
[02:43:53] <Cork> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/BNVPvB
[02:44:19] <Cork> (also please use a site that doesn't do that auto save thing)
[02:44:30] <Cork> i'm so tired of all these smart sites losing changes left and right
[02:44:52] <d3m0n> I like codepen >.< fast production
[02:46:51] <Cork> well i would be fine with it as long as it had a save button one could use to make sure the changes are saved
[02:47:03] <Cork> but sadly most of them don't
[02:47:16] <Cork> and the result is that the changes is lost half the time
[02:47:40] <Cork> (works fine as long as you are the only one ever opening it, but breaks easy if more then one person opens it)
[02:53:08] <d3m0n> Cork: you gotta fork not save?
[02:53:29] <Cork> d3m0n: sometimes
[02:53:32] <Cork> sometimes it just saves
[02:53:47] <d3m0n> Ah I see what youre sayin
[02:53:49] <Cork> but it is those times where you modify and reuse the link and it doesn't work so the change is lost
[02:53:53] <Cork> that are really annoying
[04:12:35] <kokut> Hello, anyone knows a pretty jquery ajax dropdown with bootstrap images or something i can use in one of my websites?
[04:14:16] <Cork> kokut: you could use the selectmenu from jquery ui
[04:14:31] <Cork> https://jqueryui.com/selectmenu/#custom_render
[04:15:51] <slax0r> can I somehow wait before all XHR calls of a page are done, before proceeding with some part of code?
[04:16:05] <Cork> slax0r: $.when
[04:16:25] <Cork> you have to give them all the jqxhr object though
[04:16:32] <Cork> *give it all the
[04:17:54] <slax0r> hm, or raise an even when last one is done executing and catch it?
[04:18:02] <slax0r> this could work too, right?
[04:18:08] <slax0r> s/even/event/
[04:18:29] <Cork> slax0r: sure, but not sure why you would want to involve events in this
[04:18:45] <taplar> how would the request know it was the 'last' one?
[04:20:18] <Cork> the only way to do that would be to have a counter
[04:20:38] <slax0r> I have a serious of requests that need to be done sequentially
[04:20:53] <slax0r> errr
[04:20:54] <slax0r> wtf
[04:20:57] <slax0r> s/serious/series/
[04:21:15] <Cork> so each request depends on the former one?
[04:21:17] <slax0r> so I execute one, and when it's done, execute the other
[04:21:22] <Cork> $.when won't help you there
[04:21:28] <slax0r> well, yes and no
[04:21:29] <taplar> if they're sequential then you wouldn't have multiple ajax going at once
[04:21:36] <Cork> ya
[04:21:36] <slax0r> they are dependant only on the server side...
[04:21:56] <slax0r> there aren't multiples...I'll try to explain
[04:22:25] <Cork> slax0r: what you need is to have a recursive function
[04:22:36] <Cork> that from the callback of the last one calls a new one
[04:22:44] <Cork> and it processes urls from an array
[04:22:55] <Cork> when the array is empty you can fire the "complete" callback
[04:23:01] <taplar> nice
[04:23:18] <slax0r> I'm loading random widgets on a page, which all need data from the server(PHP), the server retrieves that data from a REST, and all those calls need to be done sequentially, if not, some sessionid mumbojumbo from the REST API gets messed up, and all hell breaks loose, so normally, I am calling all of them, one after another, and that's fine, works, done deal, nothing more to do here
[04:23:28] <chipyy> hey
[04:24:04] <slax0r> but, now I have a widget which has the datatables plugin, and I'd like to use it's own ajax data retrieval voodoo
[04:24:23] <chipyy> i have a form which is like legend for google map, in form i have search bar and some buttons
[04:24:23] <taplar> slax0r: so you currently have that working, so your already making those calls synchronously?
[04:24:25] <slax0r> so I'd have to wait until all other is done, and then initiate that plugin, and have it load data
[04:24:46] <slax0r> to make sure that datatables doesn't send a request inbetween my sequential ajax calling
[04:25:12] <chipyy> so should i use ajax to send this data to php file which will check if is any data in database and then send it back ?
[04:25:18] <chipyy> or how should i do this?
[04:25:24] <taplar> slax0r: so initialize the widgit in the last call's done()
[04:26:12] <slax0r> taplar: yeah, but all of that is completely dynamic, so I'm thinking to fire an event when last one is done, and have the widget listen for that event
[04:26:31] <slax0r> unless there is something speaking heavily against using events
[04:27:27] <taplar> it just seems odd.  you already have your 'event'.  the last requests completion.  you could just call whatever you needed
[04:27:40] <taplar> it's a smell
[04:27:44] <taplar> imho
[04:28:18] <chipyy> any advice for me? :)
[04:28:47] <slax0r> yeah, but if i do in last ones done() thingy, like "initializeDatatablesWidget()", and datatables widget is not present on that current page, it will produce an error, which I do not want
[04:29:14] <taplar> if ( $(widgitSelector).length > 0 ) { .... }
[04:29:25] <slax0r> but I could add in a "onFinished" callback into this "ajax call queue", so then any widget can define its own onFinished callback, no events needed
[04:29:42] <slax0r> I mean, onQueueFinished
[04:30:33] <taplar> chipyy: you can sent data to the back with ajax, yes.
[04:30:54] <taplar> chipyy: your asking 'should', so what is your concern?
[04:31:54] <chipyy> taplar:because right now when u connect to my site it reads all data from database and writes it on google map. and i am using xml to store this values from db ..
[04:32:14] <chipyy> and dont know how i will run over it...
[04:33:38] <taplar> ok, so the user goes to your site.  the page returns the information to the page and displayed it on the google map, yes?
[04:34:03] <slax0r> this is my call queue: http://jsfiddle.net/wrhof26n/
[04:35:11] <chipyy> taplar: https://developers.google.com/maps/articles/phpsqlajax_v3#outputxml  like this is our code for map and markers
[04:36:11] <taplar> so, the user goes to the page and currently they are seeing the raw xml returned?
[04:37:19] <chipyy> taplar: and lets says that users want to find some specific markers.. so they use legend  (check options, enter in search bar) <- i use ajax to send it to php file which check if there is some data for this search and then it shows on map
[04:37:42] <chipyy> taplar: u see map with markers :)
[04:38:36] <taplar> chipyy: yeah i got that part. i'm just trying to make sure i understand your working base.  so you have a page and your map is displaying.  and now you want to do something with a form
[04:39:16] <chipyy> taplar: exactly
[04:40:01] <taplar> ok so if you were to say what you want to happen, when the user X's I want Y to happen.  what are you wanting?
[04:41:04] <chipyy> taplar: i dont know how to return data from php file and delete previous markers and show actual markers on map
[04:42:25] <taplar> ok, let me peruse this page more.  is it an actual php file, or is the xml stored in a database?
[04:43:27] <taplar> or is the data stored in a database and converted to xml, like under the "Using PHP's DOM functions to Output XML" section?
[04:44:13] <chipyy> taplar: its php file, which gets data from DB and then its stores into XML
[04:44:41] <chipyy> tapalr: Using PHP's echo to Output XML
[04:44:44] <taplar> ok then to return the file all you have to do is echo it's contents and it will be returned on a request
[04:45:49] <chipyy> aaa. so then i should create another xml file after the form is executed, return it and execute if everything is fine..
[04:47:16] <taplar> assuming your request is an update request.   send the request with the information for the new marker.  read the file contents into a variable and parse it.  add/remove/manipulate elements as desired.  (re)save the file.  return whatever you need back as a result
[04:49:02] <chipyy> its seems easy :) but we will if i will suceed :D tnx for now bye bye
[04:49:29] <taplar> chipyy: hope it helped
[04:51:44] <taplar> slax0r: i see your fiddle.  did you have a question about it?
[04:52:06] <slax0r> nah, related to the previous convo
[04:53:21] <taplar> k
[04:59:27] <hellyeah> hey
[04:59:34] <hellyeah> anyone work with jquery modal windopw
[05:00:01] <prohobo> never
[05:00:07] <hellyeah> why not?
[05:00:30] <prohobo> im just kidding, yes i have
[05:01:09] <hellyeah> hehe
[05:01:18] <hellyeah> do you use resizable: true or false
[05:01:20] <hellyeah> ?
[05:01:46] <prohobo> i've always set them to false
[05:02:20] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:02:28] <hellyeah> you prefer avoid that future
[05:02:38] <hellyeah> is there any particulart reason you do that
[05:02:39] <hellyeah> ?
[05:02:54] <chipyy> taplar: are u still here? :)
[05:02:58] <taplar> i am
[05:04:33] <chipyy> i looking some codes ... and i am seeing some return ( onclick="return f(this.form ,this.form.fname ,this.form.lname) ")
[05:04:47] <chipyy> i dont need ant return function right? :)
[05:05:39] <taplar> what is that on?
[05:06:13] <chipyy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21662836/send-form-data-using-ajax
[05:06:30] <hellyeah> hit not active button and then click "click me" button when i tryu to pop up boxes it is escaping why is that? http://jsfiddle.net/rodtd7wz/8/
[05:07:38] <taplar> chippy: if your doing a basic ajax request, no, you wouldn't need that.  as you've described your intended results, your ajax callback would be updating your map and possibly your form.
[05:08:35] <flobin> hi everyone
[05:08:54] <flobin> I’m wondering why the following doesn’t work:  menu.find("a[href*='#'" + this.id ).addClass('active');
[05:08:56] <chipyy> whats better, that i call onsubmit or create function with button which will call this ajax function?
[05:08:58] <taplar> hellyeah: i don't see a 'not active' button
[05:09:30] <flobin> oh and: var menu = jQuery.noConflict()(‘.menu')
[05:09:37] <taplar> chipyy: i'd say on submit
[05:09:56] <taplar> chipyy: but don't put that on the form directly.  bind it with js
[05:10:05] <chipyy> its any difference between them? or its just what u more like? XD
[05:10:25] <chipyy> how u mean taplar?
[05:10:30] <taplar> if you put it on a button separate from the form, if the user hits enter on a text area, causing the form to submit, you have a potential hole
[05:11:06] <taplar> <form onsubmit="...." id="myform">  <-- direct binding, avoid that
[05:11:24] <taplar> $('#myform').on('submit', function(){}); <-- indirect binding, do that
[05:11:59] <chipyy> aaa, tnx for that advice ;)
[05:12:40] <taplar> the purpose being to separate your markup from your business logic
[05:14:47] <Kartagis> why can't I use a String.prototype for an ajax response?
[05:15:07] <taplar> watcha talkin about willis?
[05:15:17] <hellyeah> taplar: yo didnt see animated button when you open jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/rodtd7wz/9/
[05:15:45] <taplar> hellyeah: oh, your talking about the glow button
[05:15:48] <Cork> Kartagis: uh, what?
[05:15:59] <Cork> why would you use the prototype for an ajax response??
[05:16:48] <hellyeah> you will see pop up boxes and when you click "click me" you will see another pop up boxes try to resize it. It is escaping to another position
[05:17:03] <Kartagis> Cork: I've got this function for Title Case, and I need it because the returning string is almost all uppercase
[05:17:18] <Cork> ok?
[05:17:32] <flobin> hm I need to rephrase my question
[05:17:34] <taplar> hellyeah: ah, interesting
[05:17:58] <flobin> so I have an ul.menu that has a bunch of lis and in those are a.menu-link
[05:18:08] <Kartagis> Cork: http://termbin.com/ua6o
[05:18:31] <flobin> the href of those links is “http://url.com/#Id” or “http://url.com/en/#Id”
[05:18:35] <hellyeah> taplar: sorry for my messy code i am new on that bussiness
[05:18:47] <Kartagis> Cork: it works for static text, but not for ajax response
[05:19:16] <flobin> so if I have this.id which corresponds to that Id, how do I select that link?
[05:19:39] <flobin> I was trying to do this: menu.find(":contains('#" + this.id"')" ).addClass('active');
[05:21:41] <taplar> hellyeah: some reason when it resizes it sets the top back to zero
[05:22:06] <taplar> i think i've seen this issue before.  not sure that by default draggable and resizeable play nicely together
[05:25:03] <hellyeah> taplar i see
[05:25:11] <hellyeah> let me try dragable false
[05:25:32] <Kartagis> I'm sure he'll let you
[05:26:26] <hellyeah> i did draggable false and true respectively no result
[05:26:40] <hellyeah> i think resizable is problematic
[05:26:41] <hellyeah> but
[05:26:52] <hellyeah> in the first p0opup you can do resizable
[05:27:06] <hellyeah> i think there is a problem in collision part
[05:27:14] <hellyeah> may be i need to change fit to something else
[05:29:23] <taplar> in my side project i ran into this with, i ended up making my modal draggable and let the size be based off of an internal textarea which are already resizable, :)
[05:36:24] <hellyeah> Kartagis: do you have any idea?
[05:37:54] <Kartagis> no
[05:38:03] <hellyeah> okey thanks :XD
[05:39:12] <taplar_afk> you might try playing around with the idea of encapsulating it in another container.  make the outer container draggable and the inner resizable, so they're setting the style elements on different objects
[05:41:20] <hellyeah> well you set drag and resize future from css?
[05:42:24] <taplar_afk> hmm?
[05:44:28] <froginvasion> Hi, I submit a form using jQuery when a button is clicked. How can I avoid that this submit is interupted by say, a second click on that button?
[05:45:14] <taplar> simple solution, disable the button
[05:45:46] <hellyeah> taplar: i am new i am sorry if i typed non-sense things
[05:46:56] <taplar> don't be sorry, just elaborate, :)
[05:47:31] <hellyeah> than ks
[05:56:58] <hellyeah> taplar: are you around?
[05:57:16] <taplar> why, you saying i'm fat?
[05:57:28] <taplar> sup?
[05:57:55] <hellyeah> :D
[05:58:10] <hellyeah> <noscript> tag does not work in xhtml
[05:58:21] <hellyeah> so is there a way to check js is enabled or disabled
[05:58:54] <taplar> hmm
[05:59:12] <froginvasion> taplar it's a link, not a button
[05:59:18] <Cork> hellyeah: i doubt very very much you're actually using xhtml
[05:59:27] <hellyeah> Cork: just a sec
[05:59:34] <onla> can I pick the src of the wrapped element and use it in the wrap? Like  $("img").wrap("<a href='path/to/imgsrc.jpg' data-lightbox='image-1' data-title='My caption'></a>");
[05:59:59] <Cork> hellyeah: you need to show the content-type header to prove that you are
[06:00:19] <hellyeah> Cork: this is what i have http://dpaste.com/0MMPS07
[06:00:30] <Cork> ...
[06:00:35] <hellyeah> it is automatically generated by asp.net
[06:00:42] <taplar> froginvasion: then you might try while the form is submitting, set a data element on the like of like 'active' or something.  then when you go into that function, before you do anything(including set that element), check to see if it is set.  if so, don't continue
[06:00:45] <Cork> that's just html with an invalid xmlns attribute
[06:00:54] <Mement> How can I target a this' h3 tag? http://pastie.org/private/sncgyjke1aquazygnmlfng
[06:00:55] <hellyeah> hahaha
[06:01:03] <hellyeah> Cork: asp.net thing it is
[06:01:04] <hellyeah> :D
[06:01:07] <taplar> "on the like" -> "on the link"
[06:01:21] <Cork> hellyeah: so ya, <noscript> should work just fine
[06:01:38] <froginvasion> taplar, tried that. While clicking the link after that does nothing, the submit is also cancelled
[06:01:46] <onla>  $("img").wrap("<a href='this.src' data-lightbox='image-1' data-title='My caption'></a>");
[06:01:47] <froginvasion> Or rather, I'm not being redirected anymore
[06:01:50] <onla> doesnt work
[06:02:00] <hellyeah> i wrote on body ta
[06:02:02] <hellyeah> g
[06:02:03] <taplar> froginvasion: create a fiddle?
[06:02:04] <hellyeah> it doesnt work
[06:02:05] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:02:10] <froginvasion> taplar, ok just a sec
[06:02:50] <taplar> Mement: 'this' is an object, string concatenation doesn't really work
[06:02:56] <Cork> onla: works just fine here http://jsfiddle.net/27xLzbo7/
[06:03:19] <Mement> taplar: Ye, I found out by the thrown exception. How would I target the h3 in that object?
[06:03:19] <taplar> Mement: are you trying to find nested h3's of the 'this' object?
[06:03:25] <Cork> hellyeah: on body tag??
[06:03:38] <Mement> taplar: Yes indeed. There is 1 h3 tag inside the ".item".
[06:03:47] <taplar> Mement: $(this).find('h3')
[06:04:29] <hellyeah> hmm i see they sugest putting noscript inside body
[06:04:39] <Mement> taplar: Thank you :)
[06:04:44] <taplar> np
[06:06:25] <Duikb00t> HeyI have a question Im running a slideup for a div with controls in it
[06:06:30] <froginvasion> taplar: I have similar code in the application http://jsfiddle.net/qdrnmzry/1/ (forgive this borked JS code, I'm dealing with legacy unfortunately)
[06:06:34] <Duikb00t> Is it possible to have a slideUp for onyl 80% of the div
[06:06:49] <froginvasion> taplar: in the fiddle it does seem to behave as expected though
[06:07:31] <taplar> your not setting the submitted to true any where
[06:07:34] <taplar> one sec
[06:07:41] <froginvasion> yeah, I saw. I set it
[06:07:55] <onla> Cork: ah tks it was some my bad
[06:09:46] <Duikb00t> Or is that not possible to slide for a specific % or height
[06:10:29] <taplar> froginvasion: something like this maybe http://jsfiddle.net/qdrnmzry/3/
[06:30:17] <notchris> How to get all form input values as array?
[06:32:35] <piXonix> notchris: you could try something like this
[06:33:06] <piXonix> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/aea2d79eeaebd0b6dd54
[06:33:15] <decx> there's serializeArray() in jquery bra
[06:33:19] <piXonix> I think this gets it as well: document.forms[0]
[06:33:36] <piXonix> that should contain all of the form elememnts for a selected form
[06:34:26] <BillCriswell> .serializeArray() is dreamy.
[06:38:58] <notchris> piXonix: TY!
[06:44:47] <piXonix> notCHris: you can also try something like this http://jsfiddle.net/smtierney/7yLyq3js/
[06:44:57] <piXonix> that might be cleaner using JQUery
[06:45:24] <Cork> uh....
[06:45:31] <Cork> there is a built in solution
[06:45:35] <Cork> just use serializeArray
[06:45:43] <Cork> ?api serializeArray
[06:45:43] <b-ot> Cork: .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[06:47:33] <piXonix> ha, i never knew that one existed...I hear serialize and think prep for JSON, etc
[06:47:35] <piXonix> as a string
[06:47:41] <piXonix> +1 to Cork
[06:47:47] <piXonix> for showing me that
[06:48:53] <taplar_afk> you've been incremented cork
[06:49:13] <Cork> so i'm a bottle cap now?
[06:49:18] <piXonix> that would be Cork++
[06:49:31] <piXonix> lol
[06:51:47] <Kartagis> so
[06:52:04] <Kartagis> Cork: any solutions for me?
[06:52:35] <Koopz> why is it so hard to work with all these jquery plugins? >_> trying to combine select2 with Bloodhound.js
[06:52:51] <Cork> ah, right the stringy thing
[06:53:14] <Cork> Kartagis: so, are you running it on a string?
[06:53:25] <Kartagis> Cork: aye
[06:53:26] <Cork> where are you trying to use it when it fails?
[06:53:52] <Kartagis> I don't understand
[06:54:10] <Duikb00t> Kartagis yo
[06:54:19] <Kartagis> hi Duikb00t
[06:54:25] <Cork> Kartagis: you said you tried to use it but you couldn't
[06:54:32] <Cork> i need to see the code where this happens
[06:56:28] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/y2xfc2gg/18/
[06:56:31] <Kartagis> Cork: ^
[06:57:08] <Cork> Kartagis: console.log(typeof(value.node.title))
[06:57:29] <Cork> run that right before the toTitleCase call
[06:58:55] <Kartagis> string
[06:59:15] <Duikb00t> Can someone help me with this slideup thingy Im trying to get it to worK ; http://tinyurl.com/oubf6nk
[06:59:22] <Cork> so you get string in the console and right after a crash cause toTitleCase is undefined?
[06:59:31] <Duikb00t> when you click multiple times it works but it's not doing really what it should.
[06:59:49] <Kartagis> no crash, I'm just no getting the title case
[06:59:50] <Cork> Kartagis: it is an each loop so it might be that one of the element isn't a string
[06:59:51] <Kartagis> not*
[06:59:54] <Cork> ah
[07:00:09] <Cork> well then toTitleCase most likely isn't doing the right thing
[07:00:28] <Kartagis> it's working with a static text
[07:00:39] <hellyeah> is it possible to get type with $?
[07:01:02] <taplar> type?
[07:01:15] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/afxtd6jm/
[07:01:20] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/y2xfc2gg/19/
[07:01:22] <hellyeah> type = checkbox?
[07:01:23] <Kartagis> see?
[07:01:27] <Cork> Kartagis: do you have a link where this is reproducible?
[07:01:35] <Cork> hellyeah: .prop('type')
[07:02:09] <Cork> or do you mean in a selector?
[07:02:25] <hellyeah> Cork: i have to do like that i saw that usge $('checkbox3').prop('type');
[07:02:31] <hellyeah> i have four checkboxes
[07:02:43] <hellyeah> i need all checkboxes in NodeList
[07:03:01] <hellyeah> not picking the type ofone of them
[07:03:11] <Cork> Kartagis: ... sorry i should have just ran the code :x
[07:03:31] <Kartagis> heh
[07:03:39] <hellyeah> i haver three checkboxes i need to select all of them
[07:03:41] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:03:49] <Kartagis> I've to run, I'll be at home in an hour
[07:03:59] <hellyeah> may be i can do $('checkbox checkbox3 checkbox4);
[07:04:19] <hellyeah> but i want to select all of them by using type of it
[07:04:26] <hellyeah> type is common "checkbox"
[07:04:30] <hellyeah> hope you got me
[07:04:54] <Cork> Kartagis: so ya http://jsfiddle.net/y2xfc2gg/20/
[07:05:03] <Cork> the plugin can't handle downcasing everything
[07:05:49] <hellyeah> i need to write my functions with ajax for sure
[07:05:50] <Cork> Kartagis: i can recommend inflection.js
[07:06:01] <hellyeah> for SPA do i need ajax?
[07:06:12] <hellyeah> single page application
[07:07:28] <hellyeah> that can work https://api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/
[07:07:42] <hellyeah> but i can have amount of N checkboxes
[07:07:49] <hellyeah> do i need to type manually?
[07:09:10] <Cork> Kartagis: https://code.google.com/p/inflection-js/ and string.titilize() is what i'm using
[07:09:25] <Cork> *titleize
[07:11:08] <hellyeah> my question doesnt make any sense
[07:11:09] <hellyeah> ?
[07:11:52] <taplar> you want to select checkboxes
[07:12:18] <taplar> $('formselector [type=checkbox]')
[07:12:29] <taplar> $('formselector [type="checkbox"]')
[07:12:47] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:13:02] <taplar> formselector being whatever class or id you have on the form
[07:13:09] <hellyeah> yes formselector is special keyword?
[07:13:15] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:13:17] <taplar> no, placeholder
[07:13:40] <Cork> or you could just use :checkbox
[07:13:51] <Cork> ?api :checkbox
[07:13:51] <b-ot> Cork: :checkbox Selector: Selects all elements of type checkbox. http://api.jquery.com/checkbox-selector/
[07:13:52] <taplar> interesting
[07:14:17] <taplar> so 'formselector :checkbox' ?
[07:14:21] <Cork> ya
[07:14:26] <taplar> cool
[07:15:23] <hellyeah> let me check
[07:16:12] <rkrara> hi how do I make a google maps canvas fill the content section in jqeury mobile
[07:18:04] <Duikb00t> Can someone help me why I have to click twice http://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/s0d57191/
[07:18:10] <Duikb00t> when I click the green text?
[07:18:49] <Cork> Duikb00t: .toggle is removed in later jquery versions you should not add more code depending on it
[07:19:00] <Duikb00t> Oh what's the new toggle?
[07:19:10] <Cork> there isn't one
[07:19:29] <Cork> the "new" toggle only toggles show/hide
[07:19:39] <hellyeah> do we have to use preventDefault?
[07:19:41] <Cork> there isn't one that toggles functions anymore
[07:19:41] <Duikb00t> hmmm so I have to keep a varaible?
[07:19:53] <Duikb00t> when I just use a  click for up and down :D
[07:19:53] <Cork> you have to implement it your self ya
[07:20:01] <Cork> but .data('state') makes that easy
[07:20:18] <Duikb00t> that's new to me
[07:20:50] <taplar> dynamic way of adding a data-* variable to an object
[07:21:49] <Duikb00t> hmm
[07:21:54] <Cork> Duikb00t: http://jsfiddle.net/s0d57191/1/
[07:22:24] <Cork> .toggle with functions where always buggy so ya, not something you want to depend on anyway
[07:22:39] <Duikb00t> Wow, thanks let me clear this up
[07:22:55] <Duikb00t>     $(this).data('state', !$(this).data('state'));
[07:23:08] <Duikb00t> this is the clicked object
[07:23:12] <Cork> ya
[07:23:20] <Cork> that line toggles the current state
[07:23:21] <Duikb00t> And when you click the firs time you add that state.
[07:23:29] <Cork> not really
[07:23:33] <Cork> !undefined == true
[07:23:37] <Duikb00t> ooh ok
[07:23:42] <Cork> so first time !undefined adds as true
[07:23:48] <Cork> and then it just toggles true/false
[07:23:50] <Duikb00t> sweet
[07:24:00] <Duikb00t> always cool that logic thinking in JS
[07:28:16] <Duikb00t> Cork I tried your approach in my real example
[07:28:25] <Duikb00t> But for some reason ... it's only working after serveral clicks on that button :s
[07:39:43] <Duikb00t> The action is flipping too hard
[07:41:53] <Koopz> i hate it when stackoverflow answers are either wrong or outdated and you just don't know why their snippets won't work

[07:46:21] <Koopz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24292669/jquery-select2-with-bloodhound-js-suggestion-engine
[07:47:04] <Koopz> after 2 hours of experimenting i found out you had to use engine.search() and not engine.get()
[07:47:44] <Koopz> 'cause engine.get expects IDs and not the query term
[07:49:41] <Koopz> too bad i can't create a comment since i don't have a reputation of 50...
[07:52:37] <Xatenev> Koopz: tell me what u wanna write :P
[07:52:41] <Xatenev> I can comment it if u want :p
[07:53:48] <Xatenev> Koopz: added a comment to the answer :)
[08:00:51] <Koopz> Xatenev, "In case anyone stumbles upon this snippet: According to the Bloodhound docs on github (9. Feb. 2015) you can't pass strings to engine.get. Use engine.search() instead" or something like that^^
[08:01:50] <Xatenev> Koopz: done
[08:02:24] <Koopz> thanks, m8 :D
[08:10:13] <Koopz> there's only one mystery to solve... how do i get my Select2 to display results before searching?^^
[08:11:40] <Koopz> it surely worked before i moved the ton of available options from the select to the Bloodhound engine...

[08:48:22] <sailendra> hello there
[08:48:28] <robertmaxrees> good morning.
[08:49:00] <sailendra> is there any plugin available to calculate time different between two given times
[08:50:27] <robertmaxrees> moment.js should be able to do that.
[08:51:24] <sailendra> robertmaxrees: have quick look at it but bit skeptical about it
[08:51:33] <robertmaxrees> uh, why?
[08:56:27] <decx> date1-date2 gives you the millisecond difference already
[08:56:38] <robertmaxrees> does it?
[08:56:44] <robertmaxrees> i always end up reaching for moment for stuff.
[08:56:58] <robertmaxrees> i guess you could use the MS difference to figure out the rest.
[08:57:00] <decx> as cumbersome as datestuff without moment is, this isnt
[08:58:05] <callumacrae> Is $.ajax(url, {
[08:58:05] <callumacrae>       data: $form.serialize(),
[08:58:07] <callumacrae>       type: 'post'
[08:58:12] <callumacrae>    oh shit sorry!
[08:58:15] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[08:58:18] <callumacrae> ignore that. ill try again. too used to slack
[08:58:51] <callumacrae> Is `$.ajax(url, { data: data, type: 'post' })` the same as `$.post(url, data)`?
[08:58:56] <callumacrae> Well, the equivilant of
[08:59:19] <decx> yes
[08:59:39] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/ <- "This is a shorthand Ajax function, which is equivalent to:"
[08:59:45] <callumacrae> thought it was. was confused about why someone changed it back
[09:04:31] <abishek> how to check if a particular element has resizable enabled or not?
[09:05:15] <callumacrae> Is there a shortcut for $.post($form.attr('action'), $form.serialize())? It seems like it would be a common pattern
[09:08:33] <shoky> nope
[10:18:02] <gnarf> `g jQuery ajaxSubmit @abishek
[10:18:02] <b-ot> abishek: jQuery.ajax() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[10:18:05] <gnarf> :(
[10:18:29] <gnarf> abishek: http://malsup.com/jquery/form/#api
[10:18:34] <gnarf> callumacrae: http://malsup.com/jquery/form/#api
[10:18:45] <gnarf> also sorry abishek - mixed up the two names
[10:19:05] <gnarf> abishek: .is(':ui-resizable') I think works?
[10:20:45] <gnarf> callumacrae: https://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/ scroll down to "Instance" if you are talking about resizable
[10:20:46] <gnarf> from ui
[10:36:24] <abishek> gnarf, thanx. I actually used if($(el).resizable('instance'))
[10:37:18] <notchris> How can I move a inline script with jquery?
[10:37:27] <notchris> I need to remove the element that is containing the script
[10:37:38] <notchris> So I would like to move it elsewhere
[11:31:39] <boobsbr> howdy
[11:38:58] <noobneedshelp> can someone tell me how i can find out why jquery is not loading properly on my site.  I am trying to submit a button but it is not submitting because i am getting this
[11:38:59] <noobneedshelp> Cannot read property 'submit' of undefined
[11:39:15] <noobneedshelp> i have been told that my jquery is not loaded in time
[11:39:26] <noobneedshelp> i have it as first script loaded on page
[11:39:56] <boobsbr> noobneedshelp: open the browser console by pressing F12
[11:40:45] <boobsbr> go to the console tab
[11:40:49] <boobsbr> then try to type 'jQuery' without quotes in the console
[11:41:10] <boobsbr> if jQuery is loaded, the browser will try to autocomplete
[11:41:29] <noobneedshelp> ok i did that
[11:41:31] <boobsbr> can also try typing jQuery.fn.jquery
[11:42:03] <boobsbr> noobneedshelp:so, what happened?
[11:42:22] <noobneedshelp> jQuery.fn.jquery produced the response 2.1.4
[11:42:54] <noobneedshelp> jQuery produced the response   y n(b, a)
[11:42:59] <boobsbr> then jQuery is loaded on your page, and its version is 2.1.4
[11:43:01] <noobneedshelp> function n(b,a)
[11:43:25] <noobneedshelp> ok then i think i am going to throw my laptop out the window then jump after it :)
[11:43:31] <boobsbr> now, what are you trying to do with the button?
[11:43:33] <noobneedshelp> i cant figure out why this damn form isnt submitting
[11:43:59] <noobneedshelp> submit a token and some other inputted fields
[11:45:35] <boobsbr> can you paste your code on pastebin, or jsfiddle?
[11:48:53] <noobneedshelp> http://pastebin.com/Kt01zYYE
[11:49:43] <noobneedshelp> there is a </script> tag that I didnt paste
[11:49:50] <noobneedshelp> between the script and the button
[11:52:51] <boobsbr> ok, I'm taking a look
[11:54:31] <Uhkis> noobneedshelp: you don't have a submit button there
[11:55:10] <Uhkis> oh nvm
[11:56:02] <Uhkis> might still be the problem tho
[11:58:44] <boobsbr> noobneedshelp: i'm not sure I understand what's going on there
[13:24:18] <gambl0re> anybody have experience using google maps api?
[13:26:29] <piXonix> we use it on a pretty regular basis
[13:26:34] <piXonix> what are you trying to do?
[13:28:37] <gambl0re> i just got an api key
[13:28:55] <gambl0re> and im trying to use the sample code from https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial
[13:29:28] <gambl0re> i pasted the api key in the code and added my url to the list of referrers

[13:30:09] <gambl0re> not sure why im getting that error message.
[13:30:33] <robertmaxrees> triple-check to make sure you have the right API key and referrer defined.
[13:31:25] <gambl0re> i copied pasted api key into code...
[13:31:36] <gambl0re> and copied pasted url into referrers
[13:31:43] <robertmaxrees> dunno then!
[13:32:09] <robertmaxrees> https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/maps/mSVyDazRMQo
[13:32:09] <gambl0re> do you even use google maps api?
[13:32:38] <robertmaxrees> it's been a long time - ^ check that link.  looks like you need to enable maps from your account.
[13:33:21] <robertmaxrees> *from your account, for a given site it looks like.
[13:34:27] <gambl0re> i did enable it
[13:34:48] <robertmaxrees> i'd read that thread then and check to see what else they suggest :)
[13:38:06] <gambl0re> shit
[13:40:50] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:46:43] <gambl0re> i created a new key now im getting a new error. This page was unable to display a Google Maps element.
[13:46:49] <gambl0re> somebody help me.
[13:47:21] <robertmaxrees> https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/business/articles/troubleshooting_auth - "This page was unable to display a Google Maps element. This URL is not authorized to use the provided Google Maps Client ID. Error Code: UnauthorizedURLForClientIdMapError "
[13:47:50] <gambl0re> it loads for like a second then the error pops up
[13:48:22] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:48:29] <robertmaxrees> looks like the error you're getting.
[13:50:40] <gambl0re> i read that already...doesnt help
[13:51:47] <robertmaxrees> something tells me you've got something misconfigured, but since we can't see your admin or anything else it's hard to help.  i'd hit up their product forums if you need more assistance.
[13:52:45] <gambl0re> what info do you need?
[13:52:51] <gambl0re> ill give it you..
[13:53:04] <robertmaxrees> (that was a hint that you need to go hit up their forums since this is #jquery :) )
[13:59:15] <gambl0re> google sucks
[14:02:40] <gambl0re> yea finally this piece of sh*t working...
[14:02:47] <robertmaxrees> what did you change?
[14:04:01] <gambl0re> changed referrers. i basically used * wildcard to accept everything.
[14:04:13] <robertmaxrees> cool, so it sounds like it was a configuration problem.
[14:05:00] <gambl0re> no it's a google problem. the other way i did it shouldve worked also.
[14:05:13] <robertmaxrees> maybe you misunderstood the documentation?
[14:05:42] <gambl0re> lots of people having this problem...
[14:05:49] <gambl0re> i dont care its working
[14:05:54] <robertmaxrees> sounds like lots of people misunderstanding their documentation :)
[14:06:47] <gambl0re> perhaps...that means google needs to write better documentation
[14:07:05] <robertmaxrees> i've always found their docs to be plenty clear, but meh.
[14:08:45] <vorscore> if you love google documentation, you've never had to look up noscript gpt for dfp
[14:08:59] <robertmaxrees> i never said i loved it - just that it's clear :)
[14:09:25] <vorscore> :D
[14:54:51] <LeBlaaanc> anyone know of an easy way to scale the height of a svg group similar to how  slideUp() works?
[14:55:07] <LeBlaaanc> I'm trying snap.svg but it's not clear how to scale an item
[14:58:23] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[14:58:26] <robertmaxrees> woops wrong window.

[17:55:04] <yashinbasement> http://jsfiddle.net/ynarwal/m6wq0srs/
[17:56:56] <yashinbasement> can any one suggest css rule for that
[18:08:17] <CoolApps> I'm currently having an issue where I would get some focus ring when focusing on a DIV element named ".footer"
[18:10:02] <CoolApps> I've tried making the ring transparent via CSS file and in JavaScript but that didn't help. Used inspect element and it didn't show any CSS that would display such thing.
[18:24:37] <yashinbasement> I don't know I have been waiting like 15 mins, please find the http://jsfiddle.net/ynarwal/m6wq0srs/, panel left shifting problem
[20:36:50] <feathersanddown> any ckeditor channel?
[21:49:15] <sailender> hello there
[21:49:59] <sailender> i am trying to get time difference between two time and using moment.js it is calculating hours but not minutes
[21:50:02] <sailender> how do i achieve that
[22:21:53] <LeBlaaanc> is there a decent library to do hashbang links? I know the logic isn't that complicated just didnt want to reinvent the wheel
[22:22:05] <LeBlaaanc> scrolling + offset are my only requirements
[22:27:21] <jak2000> LeBlaaanc hi friend
[22:27:31] <LeBlaaanc> hey buddy
[22:29:01] <jak2000> accept a pm?
[22:41:22] <theskillwithin> hey any quick no nonsense books / videos to prep me to get back in the game with jquery  front-end design
[22:41:34] <theskillwithin> starting a new job next week
[22:48:39] <fattest> when i append a <li> to a <ul> how do i see the new source code of the document?
[22:51:39] <rcyr> You can take a look at the current state of your DOM tree in your dev tools
[22:52:15] <theskillwithin> should I get this book? http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118531647/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER
[22:53:21] <fattest> ok thanks
[23:01:31] <LeBlaaanc> theskillwithin: ... all you need to know is that you are just manipulating css/html with jquery programatically... everything else you learn is just css, html, and programming
[23:02:18] <theskillwithin> I knows all that
[23:02:50] <theskillwithin> but if I wanted to do like a quick ajax thing, or something, probably would take me a bit of time research before I got it going the first time
[23:03:58] <LeBlaaanc> well if you have a solid understanding of http stack ajax is just another request that is getting done "inline"
[23:04:59] <LeBlaaanc> I'm just saying, I doubt a book would tell you something you couldn't have figured out by just looking it up in jquery docs
[23:05:34] <theskillwithin> knowing jquery it could be as easy as something like this $('#button).ajax.load($path_to_html, $('load into this div'))
[23:07:31] <theskillwithin> $( "#result" ).load( "ajax/test.html" );
[23:25:46] <Guest30_> yo
[23:27:47] <help> hey guys
[23:27:50] <help> i would like to ask
[23:27:59] <help> if document.onclick function would work on mobile ?
[23:28:14] <Cork> don't use event attributes
[23:28:23] <Cork> use event listeners
[23:29:10] <Duikb00t> A bit off topic, has someone ever made responsive e-mail to target mutiple devices ipad / mobile / . . .
[23:29:48] <Cork> Duikb00t: depending on the client you might have little options there
[23:29:56] <Cork> especially if you want outlook support
[23:30:43] <Duikb00t> Cork I heard too that developing e-mails for outlook isn't the coolest thing to do because it just don't renders all those things.
[23:31:01] <sailender> anyone using moment.js
[23:31:04] <Cork> Duikb00t: it renders html with word
[23:31:06] <Duikb00t> Is there a flow I could handle so I can target as much devices as I can.
[23:31:16] <sailender> in order to calculate time difference
[23:31:35] <Cork> Duikb00t: read msdns documentation on what html tags and css attributes word support
[23:31:39] <Cork> and only use those
[23:31:48] <Cork> note that excludes css background...
[23:31:58] <Duikb00t> *** sailender  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18623783/get-the-time-difference-between-two-datetimes
[23:32:42] <Guest67947> <Cork> you mean event listeners will work on both browser and mobile?
[23:33:03] <Cork> Guest67947: i recommend to use jquery on
[23:33:12] <Guest67947> my current one is like that
[23:33:18] <Guest67947> could u tell me if it will work on both browser and mobile
[23:33:21] <Guest67947> gimmi a min
[23:33:22] <Cork> but ya mobile and most desktop browsers support addEventListener
[23:33:32] <Guest67947>  $('#menu-toggle').on('click', function() {         //e.preventDefault();         $("#wrapper").toggleClass("active");     });
[23:33:40] <Guest67947> will this code work on both ?
[23:33:42] <Cork> uh...
[23:33:54] <Cork> what does that have to do with document.onclick??
[23:34:00] <Guest67947> because previously i used .onclick
[23:34:12] <Guest67947> then i went to google and they recommended "on" as well
[23:34:13] <sailender> Duikb00t: i tried but when i try to reduce time such as 12.00 -1.10  then i get -11 hour
[23:34:16] <Cork> well ya, those should work find
[23:34:17] <Guest67947> but i am not sure if it will work on both
[23:34:26] <sailender> it should be 1.10
[23:34:32] <Cork> Guest67947: as long as the elements exist when you bind the event
[23:34:38] <Guest67947> another question is, now i am using chrome emulator to test the device
[23:34:41] <Duikb00t> sailender :: Please make a fiddle or smoething.
[23:34:44] <Duikb00t> something**
[23:34:45] <Cork> also please fix your nick
[23:34:58] <sailender> Duikb00t: ok
[23:35:07] <Guest67947> the jquery seems to be working on the chrome emulator, but i am not sure if it will work on the real device
[23:35:15] <Guest67947> since emulator, i am "clicking" and not "tapping"
[23:35:16] <Duikb00t> https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa338201(v=office.12).aspx   ** sailender
[23:35:31] <Guest67947> changed.
[23:35:46] <Cork> Guest67947: yes, mobile trigger click events when you tap the screen
[23:35:58] <Cork> else it wouldn't work with none mobile web pages
[23:36:11] <Guest67947> hmm
[23:36:16] <Guest67947> so could i safely say
[23:36:27] <Cork> sailender: just take the newest date object minus the oldest
[23:36:33] <Guest67947> if what i tested on the chrome emulator works for jquery, it will work for a real device too ?
[23:36:38] <sailender> Duikb00t: html and css
[23:36:40] <Cork> the date object should handle it by it self
[23:36:53] <Duikb00t> Eeeh?
[23:36:59] <Cork> Guest67947: maybe
[23:37:21] <Cork> Guest67947: the click event will, but there are other aspects you basically have to test directly on the device to tell
[23:37:26] <Duikb00t> http://www.email-standards.org/   Cork
[23:37:32] <Cork> or in xcodes i* emulators
[23:37:36] <Guest67947> how do i test my localhost on a mobile device ? :/
[23:37:42] <Duikb00t> Didn't know gMail was poor as well.
[23:38:03] <Cork> Guest67947: by exposing it on your external ip
[23:38:13] <Cork> and no, that is offtopic for this channel
[23:45:08] <Cork> Cork: YLij3N4mVsJJ7KM7QUa2XmLI9w9ta3qxhEih8R
[23:45:20] <Cork> opps
