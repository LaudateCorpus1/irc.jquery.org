[00:01:44] <mechanist> hello
[00:02:00] <mechanist> is this syntax correct? http://pastebin.com/LmPY8bZf just 1 line
[00:02:26] <mechanist> it returns an empty variable
[00:29:58] <mechanist> hello
[00:30:06] <mechanist> why this doesn't return any input? https://jsfiddle.net/gusnv5v0/
[00:39:11] <somad> hi
[00:41:32] <somad> Can someone look at my code and tell me whats wrong: http://pastebin.com/QJTsGc61
[00:43:46] <somad> anyoneee?
[00:45:16] <somad> Can anyone help me and tell me whats wrong with http://pastebin.com/QJTsGc61
[00:45:26] <somad> It shows "1" but it doesn't show what I exactly want in the console.
[00:48:14] <somad> ;/
[00:49:27] <Robdgreat> somad: you're trying to match an id="listenStatus" with .listenStatus, for starters
[00:49:34] <Robdgreat> you want #listenStatus
[00:50:24] <somad> Robdgreat: I changed it to if($('#listenStatus').is(":contains('1')")){
[00:50:31] <somad> But it still shows the other one.
[00:51:57] <somad> not the one that says 1
[02:13:10] <Cork> somad: i would recommend adding a class to the element when you set the value, instead of using :contains
[02:13:27] <Cork> somad: :contains is a BIG hack and often not reliable
[02:14:17] <Cork> alternatively you can do if($('.listenStatus').text() == "1") {} if that is what you expect to be there
[02:14:35] <Cork> (but don't forget you need to count for spaces if there are any indentations)
[03:22:37] <Jerrry> Hi, can anyone point me to where I can learn to load a whole comment thread with jquery and ajax?
[03:35:53] <Cork> Jerrry: $('#target').load(url) ?
[03:36:11] <Cork> Jerrry: or what are you asking for?
[03:36:53] <Jerrry> Cork: My friend and I are building a website with Laravel, and we want to be able to open a modal that loads a comment thread with a reply box.
[03:37:13] <Jerrry> Without reloading. Sort of like on Facebook when you click on a photo.
[03:37:41] <Cork> Jerrry: so you want to either pull an html partial with the dialog and everything in it
[03:37:55] <Cork> or you want to open a dialog and pull in comments and show that in it
[03:38:13] <Cork> either way you firstly need to figure out how you want to handle the commends
[03:38:50] <Jerrry> So far we have a basic working comment system with comments stored in sql and commenting and replies working.
[03:39:11] <Cork> you won't be able to make calls to sql from js
[03:39:17] <Cork> you need to have server code inbetween
[03:39:39] <Jerrry> I see
[05:02:45] <MXBrandon> Could someone take a look at this and try to help me figure out why my server is getting a blank value for the content type header?             http://pastebin.com/nLwQE7MS
[05:03:27] <Cork> MXBrandon: the content type header shouldn't ever be blank
[05:03:38] <Cork> at worst it would be the default www-form-encoded
[05:03:56] <Cork> so check the server code
[05:04:04] <MXBrandon> when I spit out the $_SERVER values in PHP, its an empty string
[05:04:12] <Cork> MXBrandon: also you need to encode data
[05:04:16] <Cork> you can't give it an object
[05:04:25] <Cork> cause that will param encode it
[05:04:40] <Cork> JSON.stringify(object) should be enough
[05:04:52] <MXBrandon> data: JSON.stringify({ var1: "value1"}),     ?
[05:04:57] <Cork> ya
[05:05:04] <MXBrandon> I've tried that too
[05:05:28] <Cork> well that won't affect the Content-type header
[05:05:34] <Cork> but if you want to send json you have to do that
[05:06:35] <MXBrandon> ok
[05:06:51] <MXBrandon> I am still not getting a header though which is more concerning
[05:32:55] <Cork> MXBrandon: also don't write the full rul in the url field
[05:33:06] <Cork> MXBrandon: you don't want to make cross domain calls by mistake
[05:43:22] <dementorr> Hi! Can someone help me? I dont understand javascript scoping... Why isn't this working? http://pastebin.com/pXxb422Y
[05:48:53] <dementorr> Why is users in the alert always empty?? I can verify that the code executes the inner function... https://jsfiddle.net/omcchztw/
[05:53:20] <PCatinean> Hey guys, I have two questions
[05:53:26] <Cork> dementorr: it isn't about scoping
[05:53:33] <Cork> dementorr: getJSON is async
[05:53:52] <PCatinean> How does one trigger a event only when a blur is done on a input field only when the original value is changed?
[05:53:56] <Cork> dementorr: so the execution order is 1,2,8 <later> 3,4,5,6
[05:54:04] <Cork> dementorr: so when the alert runs users is empty
[05:54:15] <PCatinean> I mean if I have nothing and type xx then blur it's triggered, then if I enter and type yy, then remove the yy and blur it does not trigger
[05:54:56] <Cork> PCatinean: you don't you check the value in the event handler
[05:55:53] <PCatinean> I think you're supposed to store the value somewhere when the event is triggered and then compare maybe?
[05:56:46] <Cork> PCatinean: ya
[05:57:20] <PCatinean> at least I have a good thought process :))
[05:57:26] <PCatinean> though maybe there was some in-built thingy
[05:57:28] <Cork> on('change', function() { if(this.value != $(this).data('old-value')) { /* the code */ $(this).data('old-value', this.value) } })
[05:57:46] <PCatinean> Cork, and how do I trigger that for all input tags except the type="file" ?
[05:58:01] <Cork> PCatinean: i would just give them a class and use that
[05:58:09] <Cork> normally the cleanest
[05:58:10] <PCatinean> that's also a fair point
[05:58:27] <Cork> alternatviely you can do $(':input:not([type="file"]')
[05:58:36] <PCatinean> or better when I serialize the fields to send them to the server I send the filename or size
[05:58:51] <Cork> or rather $('form').on('change', ':input:not([type="file"]', func)
[05:58:52] <PCatinean> Though it could be multi-selection
[05:59:20] <Cork> PCatinean: hmm, wouldn't make it server side
[05:59:21] <PCatinean> any problems with older browsers using that selector Cork?
[05:59:27] <PCatinean> no?
[05:59:34] <Cork> you would have to go very old
[05:59:41] <Cork> :not() has been around for a long time
[06:00:03] <Cork> http://caniuse.com/#search=%3Anot
[06:00:22] <dementorr> Cork: And how can i make getJSON run sync?
[06:00:27] <PCatinean> I swear jquery should have a built-in useragent check and if it sees like ie 5 or 6 to just replace the dom with "Really nigga?"
[06:00:35] <Cork> dementorr: no you should't make sync ajax calls
[06:00:46] <Cork> dementorr: that will freeze the webpage until the server answers
[06:00:59] <Cork> dementorr: learn to make async code, you will need it anyway
[06:01:06] <PCatinean> gmm IE 11 does not support it
[06:01:06] <PCatinean> :))
[06:01:18] <Cork> PCatinean: it used to have a $.browser property
[06:01:28] <dementorr> Cork: Oh.. so all my logic has to go in the async callback method then... Thanks for infos :)
[06:01:28] <Cork> PCatinean: it isn't really needed anymore though
[06:01:43] <PCatinean> what is not?
[06:01:45] <Cork> dementorr: ya, also check at deferred
[06:01:59] <Cork> PCatinean: checking for ie < 7
[06:02:12] <Cork> ie5 is extinct so why check for it
[06:02:18] <Cork> and ie6 is just about dead
[06:03:44] <PCatinean> it was about time
[06:04:19] <PCatinean> but since the feature is not supported by ie 11
[06:04:24] <PCatinean> that's, pretty bad I guess
[06:05:59] <Cork> :not is supported by ie7+
[06:06:08] <Cork> that link is for css4 not list...
[06:06:22] <Cork> not sure why caniuse only shows that...
[06:06:37] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/:not#Browser_compatibility
[06:06:45] <Cork> ie9+
[06:06:54] <Cork> so not ie7 and 8
[06:07:05] <PCatinean> hmm strange
[06:08:04] <PCatinean> Cork, what if I just check for type attribute when the even is fired and break?
[06:08:22] <PCatinean> PLus, how many inputs can there be in the dom
[06:08:42] <Cork> PCatinean: that is about the same cost
[06:08:58] <PCatinean> yeah, and much safer
[06:08:59] <Cork> PCatinean: ya it is farily fine, i just loath attribute selectors
[06:09:05] <PCatinean> hahah :))
[06:09:06] <Cork> (i have no problem with :not() selectors)
[06:09:17] <PCatinean> yeah I don't feel fully comfortable with them either for some reason
[06:09:50] <Cork> so i usually do things like 'input:not(.file-picker)'
[06:10:10] <PCatinean> if (cfg_input.attr('type') == 'file') {return;}
[06:10:28] <Cork> ya, no point in that
[06:11:34] <PCatinean> in what?
[06:12:22] <Cork> doing it in js code
[06:12:51] <Cork> the selector will be faster for this case what ever option you pick
[06:13:01] <PCatinean> I mean since this application is extensible people and place their own input file fields and if they do not append the class
[06:13:05] <PCatinean> it's bad
[06:13:12] <PCatinean> this way it just ignores it when it gets there
[06:13:18] <PCatinean> That's why I wanted to do it n js
[06:13:33] <Cork> then use the selector
[06:13:51] <Cork> you should delegate the handler to the form either way
[06:14:16] <PCatinean> config_form.on('blur', '.custom_val', onchange);
[06:14:18] <Cork> $(form).on('change', ':input:not([type="file"])')
[06:14:22] <Cork> ya
[06:14:23] <PCatinean> this is how it's triggered firstly
[06:21:16] <PCatinean> Cork, btw isn't there a tool that checks your entire js code and gives you a overall percentage on which browsers your code will fully work?
[06:26:48] <MXBrandon> Cork: It is a cross domain call actually. Thats why I am using jsonp
[07:11:50] <Cork> PCatinean: that would be very VERY hard
[07:12:03] <Cork> PCatinean: it would also be out of date in about a month
[07:14:42] <decx> babel?
[07:20:37] <PCatinean> Cork, what about just grepping the source, making a list of the functions used and running them by caniuse?
[07:21:02] <Cork> PCatinean: can i use mapps for css mostly
[07:21:24] <Cork> also caniuse isn't exactly always accurate
[07:49:15] <CaptainMoronic> Can anyone help me figure out what causes the massive freeze when you scroll on this page in chrome? http://www.gustav.be/supablow
[07:49:55] <Cork> CaptainMoronic: you have any scroll events?
[07:50:24] <CaptainMoronic> No not that I'm aware of
[07:53:04] <Cork> velocity does
[07:53:10] <Cork> it might be the cause
[07:53:26] <Cork> but it is WAY to much js for me to dig into the cause
[07:53:29] <CaptainMoronic> I'll disable it and report back with the result :)
[07:53:32] <CaptainMoronic> Fair enough
[07:53:46] <Cork> rip out libs and see where it stops freezing
[07:54:51] <CaptainMoronic> My issue lies that I don't know why it only triggers when I scroll past a certain point as well as to what is causing it of course :p But I'll do that ^-^
[07:55:10] <Cork> cause something triggers a js loop most likely
[07:55:36] <Cork> (function triggers by an event that modifies something that triggers and event that triggers the original function again and so on)
[07:55:48] <CaptainMoronic> Hmm and it only overflows when a certain amount of scrolling takes place hmm good theory
[08:37:23] <CaptainMoronic> Cork: Figured it out. One of the designers had given me an 140mb png that somehow cause massive scroll delays when it came into frame
[08:38:26] <Cork> O_o
[08:38:30] <Cork> i can guess why
[08:38:47] <Cork> now days i tend to not use images at all :)
[08:39:25] <slax0r> 140mb png? was it an image of his mom or something?
[08:42:03] <CaptainMoronic> Worst part is the guy is my project leader so not like I can yell at him :c
[08:42:12] <Cork> lol
[08:42:28] <Cork> a designer as the project leader?!?
[08:42:35] <CaptainMoronic> I know
[08:42:40] <Cork> that sounds horrible
[08:42:43] <CaptainMoronic> It is
[08:42:52] <MassDebates> hey guys
[08:42:52] <slax0r> best advice, run...
[08:42:55] <slax0r> run and never look back
[08:42:59] <CaptainMoronic> I am in september :D
[08:43:10] <MassDebates> looking to debug missing ) in argument list
[08:43:15] <CaptainMoronic> Going back to uni to finish my masters
[08:43:46] <Cork> MassDebates: why do you need to debug that?
[08:43:57] <Cork> just add the missing parenthesis
[08:44:16] <slax0r> think he wants to find out where exactly its missing
[08:44:59] <Cork> make a jsfiddle (or what ever) with the line (including a few lines before and after)
[08:45:02] <CaptainMoronic> We've all been there. Missing parathesis but it's right fucking there code gah god
[08:45:33] <MassDebates> Sorry, I wasn't finished
[08:45:40] <MassDebates> Had to answer a question for someone
[08:46:05] <MassDebates> Anyways, so I took it and popped it into notepad to check if any brackets and anything had no partner (closing for opening, or vice versa)
[08:46:24] <MassDebates> They all checked out with a twin, so then I took my code and dumped it into codepen, because I remember it had a JS analyze tool
[08:47:17] <MassDebates> When I did that, it flew up about 4 errors; After some rounds of "try random fix that sounds like what it wants" I got the secret combination. It was an extra ;
[08:47:32] <MassDebates> So I took 'er out, but now when I try to run the script in my wordpress installation, there's still no dice.
[08:47:40] <MassDebates> No errors now, but no action, either.
[08:47:45] <MassDebates> How do I figure this out?
[08:47:54] <Cork> MassDebates: show us the code
[08:47:58] <Cork> else we can't help you much
[08:48:17] <Cork> MassDebates: the only generic answer i can give you is look at related lines
[08:49:03] <MassDebates> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/PzJgVj
[08:49:21] <MassDebates> line 29 (last line) i had a ; in between the ) and the }
[08:51:16] <Cork> MassDebates: first of (this is just a recommendation though)
[08:51:24] <Cork> don't use if statements without {}
[08:51:40] <Cork> they tend to be leaky and you can get nasty bugs over time in the code
[08:51:55] <MikeD_> is there a known caveat using ui elements with event listeners inside a jquery .dialog() ?
[08:52:23] <Cork> MikeD_: nope
[08:53:17] <urosh_> hello guys , is there anyone interested in helping one beginer noob developer with hashchange method ? I'm pretty sure it won't take much time. Thanks
[08:53:20] <MassDebates> Sorry hold on
[08:53:24] <MassDebates> That's not the right version
[08:53:34] <MassDebates> that was what someone just suggested to me about 10 minutes ago
[08:53:49] <Cork> MassDebates: thx, cause that one looks valid >_<
[08:54:17] <Cork> urosh_: don't ask for someone, if you have a question ask it
[08:54:37] <Cork> but be prepared that you are expected to know the very basics of js before asking
[08:55:35] <Cork> (basically we expect you to be stuck on something not asking for a teacher)
[08:56:08] <MassDebates> here's the working code in codepen
[08:56:08] <MassDebates> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/QEqPPx
[08:56:55] <MassDebates> Was trying to adapt this: https://codepen.io/din_wolf/pen/qDmfL
[08:57:23] <Cork> MassDebates: and that one (the prev one) throws errors?
[08:59:16] <MassDebates> None of them throw errors now
[08:59:41] <MassDebates> But when I put them in wordpress there's nothing that happens
[08:59:46] <MassDebates> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/PzJgVj
[09:01:01] <MassDebates> First I started off with what I was adapting from. That's this here: https://codepen.io/din_wolf/pen/qDmfL .  It wasn't working in wordpress, so I figured I'd put it in a jQuery(document).ready(function($){....} here: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/PzJgVj . While these work in codepen, they don't work in wp.
[09:02:06] <MassDebates> Sorry about the confusion.
[09:02:10] <Cork> MassDebates: (function() {})() != $(document).ready(function() {})
[09:02:17] <Cork> the first is just a scoping
[09:02:19] <MassDebates> ?
[09:02:36] <Cork> MassDebates: you changed what the outer function do quite a bit
[09:02:45] <MassDebates> oh
[09:02:57] <MassDebates> I thought I was just making it wait until everything else on the page has been loaded
[09:03:26] <Cork> and ready doesn't wait until everything else is loaded
[09:03:37] <Cork> it waits until the original document has been created
[09:04:26] <Cork> though that said, that should still work
[09:04:37] <Cork> MassDebates: is the list loaded through ajax?
[09:04:40] <MassDebates> No
[09:04:50] <MassDebates> PHP generated
[09:04:59] <MassDebates> pulls from a query and places on page
[09:05:01] <Cork> use console.log in the code and see so the selectors find anything
[09:05:07] <Cork> that is most likely where things break
[09:05:12] <MassDebates> at the end of it?
[09:05:18] <Cork> like $('.dficont').length == 0 for example
[09:05:26] <Cork> no at each time you make a dom find
[09:06:50] <MassDebates> Hm
[09:06:56] <MassDebates> I'm going to figure this out.
[09:07:59] <MassDebates> brb, I shall return with this issue resolved!
[09:08:09] <Cork> good hunting! :)
[09:14:06] <notchris> If I'm using ajax post
[09:14:13] <notchris> $.post('save.php', postData)
[09:14:57] <notchris> and postData is an array
[09:15:03] <notchris> How do I access the array items
[09:15:18] <notchris> tried to do $metadata = $_POST['metadata'];
[09:18:01] <Cork> notchris: it has to be an array of objects if it is an array
[09:18:08] <Cork> you can't post a pure array of values
[09:18:30] <notchris> ahhh
[09:18:32] <notchris> TY
[09:18:42] <Cork> for "metadata" to work you have to do { metadata: [] }
[09:18:47] <notchris> I see .post has ".always"
[09:18:52] <notchris> does ajax have that?
[09:18:58] <Cork> yes
[09:19:18] <Cork> $.post is just a wrapper around $.ajax(, { type: "POST" })
[09:19:51] <Cork> $.post == function(url, data) { return $.ajax(url, { type: 'post', data: data }); }
[09:20:08] <Cork> so $.post is kinda pointless in my view
[09:20:52] <notchris> ahh
[09:20:54] <Cork> notchris: and for a code reference http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=jQuery.post
[09:21:08] <Cork> so it is a LITTLE more complex then what i showed
[09:21:19] <notchris> ahh
[09:21:22] <notchris> So i set up ajax
[09:21:26] <notchris> but the .post im converting
[09:21:27] <Cork> ya
[09:21:29] <notchris> has .always
[09:21:38] <Cork> well...
[09:21:46] <Cork> $.post(url, {})
[09:21:51] <Cork> or lets backup
[09:21:56] <notchris> here one sec
[09:22:01] <Cork> $.post(url, {}).always(function() {})
[09:22:05] <Cork> is exactly the same thing as
[09:22:12] <gevs> hello people! :) i would like to extend my $(window).resize call in order to detect and handle resizing of one of the container (it happens because i have a menu trigger button)
[09:22:23] <Cork> $.ajax(url, { type: 'post', data: {} }).always(function() {})
[09:22:31] <gevs> unfortunately $(document).resize() and $("#theExactContainer").resize() dont seem to work :/
[09:23:03] <Cork> gevs: resize only happen when the window is resized
[09:23:23] <Cork> gevs: $("#theExactContainer").resize() would only work if the jsscript resizing that element is firing an event
[09:23:32] <gevs> ok, a plugin resizes the <section>
[09:23:33] <Cork> by default there is no event for that
[09:23:38] <gevs> ok understood
[09:23:49] <Cork> you have to check if the plugin fires an event
[09:23:52] <Cork> or if it has a callback
[09:23:54] <gevs> yup
[09:24:05] <Cork> if it has neither you have to modify it
[09:24:43] <gevs> haha damn, it only changes a class xD
[09:24:57] <Cork> there you go
[09:25:24] <Cork> gevs: you could add a line that fires a custom event
[09:25:40] <Cork> like $(this).trigger('state-class-changed')
[09:25:49] <Cork> where this is the target of the plugin
[09:25:59] <Cork> (psudo code so it needs to be modified)
[09:26:07] <Cork> then you can catch that event with .on
[09:26:32] <gevs> yeah already looking into that thanks :)
[09:46:19] <jose3_> Any of yall know how to make a dynamic amount of background colors in chart.js
[10:23:25] <bonerx2k> when creating a global, is it better to always use window.variable = true; instead of just variable = true; ?
[10:24:58] <Cork> bonerx2k: if you ever want to use strict mode you have to
[10:25:07] <Cork> the later is a parser error in strict mode
[10:26:04] <Cork> bonerx2k: https://jsfiddle.net/g94dvc9j/
[10:26:31] <Cork> so yes, you should always use window.<global variable name>
[10:40:40] <Mattx> Hey people! I'm processing some <selects> with .map, and I'm getting the result I want, but also a lot of junk info and functions added by jQuery. How do I get a clean copy of the json object?
[10:41:15] <Mattx> I'm getting a length attribute, prevObject, etc
[10:41:21] <Cork> Mattx: use $.map not $().map
[10:41:40] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[10:42:13] <Cork> $().map is for dom elements, $.map is for any js object/array
[10:45:58] <Mattx> Cork, worked, thanks!
[11:25:18] <madprops> there's a set of div with class 'comment' and each 'comment' has other children 'comment'  ... how can I get the visible 'comment' elements that are not the children 'comment' ... like the topost or something
[11:25:19] <madprops> ?
[11:41:07] <momomo> is it normal for 100vh to depeend on wether you have a bookmark toolbar adn a web-developer toolbar in ff ?
[11:57:08] <NoiseEee> 100vh?
[13:00:49] <catuca> I have got an elemente like this <div class="partners partner-1"></div>. "
[13:01:13] <catuca> I have got an elemente like this <div class="partners partner-1"></div>. "partner-1" changes to "partner-2" and so on. I would like to get just that part: partner-2
[13:01:40] <robertmaxrees> is there any way you can change your markup so you can use a data attribute for that part instead?
[13:01:44] <robertmaxrees> it would make your life easier.
[13:01:53] <catuca> robertmaxrees: How did I not think of that?
[13:01:57] <catuca> robertmaxrees: You are right
[13:02:05] <catuca> robertmaxrees: alright. back to work. ttyl and thanks
[13:02:55] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:07:41] <catuca> robertmaxrees: Ok so with data-partner=1...after I clone this guy, I want to change data-partner to 2. How can I do that?
[13:07:55] <robertmaxrees> .data('partner', 2);
[13:08:00] <catuca> robertmaxrees: k
[13:09:36] <catuca> robertmaxrees: This is throwing an error: $('#account_details_container .partners:last').after($('#account_details_container .partners:last').clone().data('partner', 2));
[13:09:47] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle duder.
[13:10:06] <catuca> robertmaxrees: I hear you
[13:28:53] <catuca> robertmaxrees: I resolved the issue. It ended up being a typo.
[13:28:57] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[13:30:21] <catuca> robertmaxrees: Now the issue is that it won't update data-partner. Something like this finds the last div but it doesn't update the partner-data: jQuery('#account_details_container .partners:last').data('partner', "2");
[13:30:32] <robertmaxrees> how are you checking?
[13:30:41] <catuca> robertmaxrees: Checking for what?
[13:30:42] <robertmaxrees> if you're looking at your dev tools, that's the wrong place to check.
[13:30:50] <robertmaxrees> the data-partner value.
[13:30:50] <catuca> robertmaxrees: firebug
[13:30:54] <robertmaxrees> yeah, wrong place.
[13:30:57] <robertmaxrees> need to console.log() it.
[13:30:57] <notchris> in an ajax return
[13:31:00] <notchris> I'm doing var x = $(data).find($('div.content'));
[13:31:14] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:31:23] <catuca> robertmaxrees: I will look at the source
[13:31:24] <notchris> I'm doing an ajax request to a php page that echos a div
[13:31:30] <notchris> with the class 'content'
[13:31:31] <robertmaxrees> catuca errr.
[13:31:37] <catuca> robertmaxrees: ok where?
[13:31:39] <robertmaxrees> you need to console.log() the data attribute value.
[13:31:42] <robertmaxrees> in the console.
[13:31:47] <catuca> robertmaxrees: understood
[13:33:02] <catuca> robertmaxrees: You are right. Why doesn't it change the DOM?
[13:33:09] <robertmaxrees> *the markup.
[13:33:15] <robertmaxrees> the DOM is updating, the page is not.
[13:33:22] <catuca> robertmaxrees: ohh..k
[13:33:49] <catuca> robertmaxrees: why is the page not updating? isn't it suppose to?
[13:33:50] <robertmaxrees> :) .data() interacts with a cached version of the attribute, which is MUCH faster (as safer) than accessing the markup.
[13:33:57] <catuca> robertmaxrees: ah k
[13:34:00] <catuca> robertmaxrees: gotcha
[13:34:08] <catuca> robertmaxrees: cool. thanks again. I am back to work.
[14:02:04] <notchris> hey robertmaxrees, I'm doing an ajax request and I want to return json
[14:02:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:02:13] <notchris> So I set my datatype, and i echoed the json in the php file im calling
[14:02:29] <notchris> echo $item['metadata'];
[14:02:38] <notchris> And then I got my json back from the ajax request
[14:02:50] <notchris> My question is, what if I have two json strings im returning
[14:03:10] <notchris> If I echo two strings in the php file, my ajax request fails
[14:03:32] <robertmaxrees> because that's not valid json.
[14:03:37] <robertmaxrees> you can only return one object.
[14:03:45] <notchris> Damn
[14:03:48] <robertmaxrees> if you have multiples to return, do an array or use properties.
[14:03:49] <notchris> I need to return two
[14:04:07] <robertmaxrees> how do they differ?
[14:04:31] <notchris> so instead of echo $item['a'] . $item['b']
[14:04:35] <notchris> I could do like
[14:04:39] <robertmaxrees> i don't know any php.
[14:04:47] <notchris> ah OK
[14:04:49] <robertmaxrees> so all i can tell you is that you need to ship back ONE object.
[14:05:08] <robertmaxrees> that object could be an array.  or you could make those each a prop on an object.
[14:12:52] <NoiseEee> an array notchris
[14:13:01] <notchris> Right
[14:13:06] <notchris> but since the data is returned from php
[14:13:12] <notchris> I need to do some reasearch on php
[14:13:18] <notchris> on how to echo the objects in one array
[14:13:21] <NoiseEee> $goodJSON = json_encode('someProperty' => 'someValue', 'anotherProperty' => 'anotherValue')
[14:13:51] <robertmaxrees> an array might not be the best idea depending on what that data is imo.
[14:42:26] <joaocastanho> hi. I need a live support script that only have a text area box
[14:42:30] <joaocastanho> Is there any?
[14:42:48] <robertmaxrees> that requires a fair amount more than just a small bit of JS.
[14:43:12] <robertmaxrees> there's a backend component that you need to build out, too.
[14:43:58] <joaocastanho> okay. and there's any script pre-made?
[14:44:18] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:44:34] <robertmaxrees> have you searched google?  what you can use changes depending on your backend.
[14:47:33] <joaocastanho> okay
[14:47:34] <joaocastanho> thanks
[15:32:21] <hastur> so i'm trying to make a GET request in order to access JSON data from my Rails DB... but on page load (yes i wait for document.ready), the GET requests are not retrieving any data. the requests work from the console, so the routing must be hooked up fine... is it a problem of timing? do i have to manually wait for the GET request to finish? (the req in question is $.get("/model/id.json") which returns an empty request.)
[15:32:26] <robertmaxrees> yes, you have to wait.
[15:32:35] <hastur> hello... again...
[15:32:39] <hastur> ;p
[15:32:44] <robertmaxrees> $.get().then(function(returnData) { console.log(returnData) });
[15:33:04] <hastur> awesome. thank you.
[15:33:06] <hastur> :(
[15:33:08] <hastur> (: ***
[15:33:13] <robertmaxrees> haha
[15:34:00] <robertmaxrees> so yeah, $.ajax() and its ilk are all asynchronous functions.
[15:36:25] <hastur> which means, specifically, that they don't return a value at invocation, but after they complete execution?
[15:36:32] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[15:36:39] <robertmaxrees> well, they DO return a value at invocation.
[15:36:47] <robertmaxrees> but it's not the return of the call.
[15:37:02] <robertmaxrees> they all return a promise object that resolves or rejects.
[15:37:32] <hastur> ahh
[15:37:32] <hastur> ok
[15:37:46] <robertmaxrees> so $.ajax() returns a promise.  that's why you can run .then() off it.
[15:38:32] <hastur> and .then will run after it resolves?
[15:38:45] <robertmaxrees> the callback registered using it will be run, yes.
[15:48:11] <hastur> hmm.. it looks like the rest of the code is still running before the requests have resolved. what's the Best Practices way to wait until the requests finish to run the rest of the code?
[15:48:17] <catuca> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/duonfobs/ On this piece of code, why won't the yellow background apply to all others except the one that it was clicked on?
[15:48:24] <hastur> as janky as it is there might not even be a best practices way haha
[15:48:45] <robertmaxrees> hastur literally everything that relies on it finish needs to be in that callback.
[15:48:48] <robertmaxrees> or called from that callback.
[15:49:03] <hastur> gotcha.
[15:49:38] <robertmaxrees> hastur because you're only affecting the one that was clicked on .
[15:49:42] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is the clicked element.
[15:49:53] <robertmaxrees> so $(this).each(function() { is trying to .each() over one element.
[15:50:12] <catuca> robertmaxrees: ohhh
[15:50:15] <catuca> robertmaxrees: that's right
[15:50:40] <robertmaxrees> and $(this).filter(function(){ doesn't make any sense because $(this) would be the current element being enumerated, of which there's only one.
[15:50:54] <catuca> robertmaxrees: k
[15:50:55] <robertmaxrees> there's an easier way to do this.
[15:51:01] <catuca> robertmaxrees: please tell me
[15:51:30] <catuca> robertmaxrees: The end goal is not to apply the yellow background but if I can get that far, I think I can do the other stuff.
[15:51:33] <robertmaxrees> set the all back to yellow and then set the current one to whatever color you need.
[15:51:43] <hastur> oh my sweet christ it worked
[15:51:46] <hastur> jesus
[15:52:08] <hastur> what angel sent you from heaven
[15:52:17] <robertmaxrees> $('.#account_details_container .partners').css('background-color', 'yellow'); $(this).css('background-color', 'black') or w/e.
[15:52:23] <robertmaxrees> hastur hahaha
[15:54:01] <catuca> robertmaxrees: Is this syntax correct: current = jQuery(this, '.partners').data('.partner'); ?
[15:54:15] <robertmaxrees> catuca no.
[15:54:24] <catuca> robertmaxrees: k
[15:54:53] <catuca> robertmaxrees: k. maybe .children('.partners')?
[15:55:03] <robertmaxrees> catuca what are you trying toa ccomplish now?
[15:55:11] <robertmaxrees> that's not the same as what you were just doing.
[15:55:15] <catuca> robertmaxrees: Ok. So I will try to explain the whole thing.
[15:55:19] <robertmaxrees> maybe you can flesh out the fiddle instead?
[15:55:27] <catuca> robertmaxrees: sure. That's fine.
[15:55:29] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:55:41] <catuca> robertmaxrees: please give me a few minutes to put that together.
[15:55:45] <robertmaxrees> absolutely.
[16:04:37] <catuca> robertmaxrees: The goal is to add disabled="disabled" to all the other input fields except the current partner div. https://jsfiddle.net/duonfobs/1/
[16:05:18] <catuca> robertmaxrees: So if I am on .partner-1, all the other parner-X div's must have its fields disabled=disabled
[16:05:22] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:05:40] <robertmaxrees> is this fiddle complete?
[16:05:51] <catuca> robertmaxrees: It has everything we need. So yes.
[16:05:57] <robertmaxrees> it's not working for me.
[16:06:06] <robertmaxrees> ah the hiding/showing is what you're fixing.
[16:06:09] <robertmaxrees> got it.  long day :)
[16:06:18] <catuca> robertmaxrees: sorry.
[16:06:45] <robertmaxrees> so how are you matching each value in that dropdown with a group on inputs?
[16:06:51] <catuca> robertmaxrees: So the goal is to disabled all the other input fields within a partner class except the current one.
[16:07:28] <catuca> robertmaxrees: So if I am in .partner-1, all my fields can be submitted on POST. But all other .partner-1, .parner-2 should be disabled.
[16:07:29] <robertmaxrees> trying to figure out how you envisioned that dropdown to work.
[16:07:57] <robertmaxrees> oh so this doesn't contain the code for the dropdown to work?
[16:08:04] <robertmaxrees> sorry, way lost now :)
[16:08:18] <catuca> robertmaxrees: its ok
[16:08:22] <catuca> robertmaxrees: the drop down does work
[16:08:23] <robertmaxrees> it would make sense to me to enable/disable when that changes.
[16:08:28] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't work for me.
[16:08:32] <catuca> k
[16:08:39] <robertmaxrees> not on https://jsfiddle.net/duonfobs/1/ at least.
[16:09:27] <catuca> robertmaxrees: I hate to do this but I need to commit some code. It won't take me long. Be back in a few minutes ,ok?
[16:09:33] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:09:37] <catuca> robertmaxrees: thanks
[16:09:46] <robertmaxrees> fix up the fiddle when you have a few :)
[16:09:50] <catuca> k
[16:14:10] <catuca> robertmaxrees: Sorry about that. I am done with committing code. So what did you want me to do again?
[16:14:18] <robertmaxrees> make the fiddle work?
[16:14:22] <catuca> that's ok
[16:14:26] <catuca> that's right
[16:15:17] <robertmaxrees> partially because hooking into that would probably make the mnost sense, though I'd wonder why you're not treating each section as a separate form instead.
[16:17:30] <catuca> robertmaxrees: Ok. this fiddle should work
[16:18:40] <robertmaxrees> did you see my question about using multiple forms btw?
[16:18:50] <catuca> robertmaxrees: each one of those inputs have a onChange="save_field()" that saves the data onto the database. So the issue now is that when I have multiple partners, the data is updated on all partners. So the intention is the disable the fields that are not meant to change
[16:18:55] <catuca> robertmaxrees: yes, i did
[16:20:07] <catuca> robertmaxrees: So if I understand you right, I would wrap each partner in a <form> tag with a different name. correct?
[16:20:27] <robertmaxrees> errr, no need to give them names.
[16:20:51] <robertmaxrees> i get the feeling your change handler (which shouldn't be assigned via your markup btw) is saving the entire form on that page, right?
[16:21:29] <robertmaxrees> because you could change that to just save the form that changed.
[16:21:32] <robertmaxrees> very trivially.
[16:22:00] <catuca> right, it is updating everything
[16:22:15] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so you change that you only submit the current form via ajax.
[16:22:29] <robertmaxrees> very easy to change.
[16:23:11] <catuca> alright. I am going to try to sink that idea in. Thanks Robert(if that's your name)
[16:23:19] <robertmaxrees> heh, it's pretty easy.
[16:23:27] <robertmaxrees> $(this).closest('form') will get you the form.
[16:23:44] <robertmaxrees> you could bind a submit listener to both and then just trigger the submit event on the form.
[16:23:45] <catuca> humm
[16:24:02] <catuca> k. Well, let me go think this through.
[16:24:10] <robertmaxrees> that's going to be a safter bet because you really have two separate forms on this page anyway,
[16:24:12] <catuca> I will come back here with more questions...I am sure I wil
[16:24:26] <catuca> k
[16:24:38] <catuca> Alright, I gotta take a mental break anyways.
[16:24:42] <catuca> I appreciate your help.
[16:25:03] <robertmaxrees> definitely.  i might check out learn.jquery.com btw.
[16:25:25] <catuca> robertmaxrees: yep. I definitely need to do that.
[18:05:32] <hmmhesays> say I have some div id's stored in an array. Can I use those values to update text between div tags?  $("#"+myArr['update']).text("Hello world!");
[18:06:25] <robertmaxrees> coupla things - myArr['update'] that's not an array :).  and getting the text between sibling elements is a pita.
[18:09:13] <robertmaxrees> hmmhesays ^
[18:11:42] <hmmhesays> I'll rephrase. Given should the following update the text of elements with id "someid. myVar = "someid"; $("#"+myVar).text("Hello world!");
[18:12:05] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:12:18] <robertmaxrees> assuming that element exists at the time that the code runs
[18:12:57] <hmmhesays> That element definitely exists. Something still isn't right though. As long as that should work I'm on the right path
[18:13:15] <robertmaxrees> i'd check to make sure you're not reusing IDs.
[18:14:10] <hmmhesays> yeah definitely not that either. It works when I'm using a constant string. Must have something else goofy
[18:14:23] <robertmaxrees> triplecheck the value of myVar.
[18:14:42] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're not accidentally doing like ##someValue
[18:22:06] <robertmaxrees> devices/browsers
[18:23:16] <robertmaxrees> woops wrong window for that.
[18:24:29] <hmmhesays> heh it was variable context
[18:24:40] <robertmaxrees> hmmhesays ah - opened your console?
[18:24:53] <hmmhesays> yeah
[18:24:56] <specialtech> hey robertmaxrees - is this logical?
[18:24:57] <specialtech> https://jsfiddle.net/9L1jk12v/
[18:25:13] <robertmaxrees> specialtech no reason to ask just me ;)
[18:25:32] <specialtech> xD
[18:25:35] <robertmaxrees> looks like these are the same except for the URL?
[18:25:38] <specialtech> Yea but I saw your name first haha
[18:25:50] <robertmaxrees> just ask the channel in the future :) plenty of other people can help.
[18:26:03] <robertmaxrees> plus getting pinged outside of convos can be weird.
[18:26:15] <specialtech> yea will do, sorry about that
[18:26:19] <robertmaxrees> either way!  it makes sense, but I'd build the markup fragment ahead of time instead.
[18:26:43] <specialtech> yea, so I want to return a user to the category only if they visited the category section before, if not send to homepage.
[18:26:43] <robertmaxrees> also: never use == - always use ===
[18:26:47] <specialtech> kk
[18:26:56] <robertmaxrees> also: try to do this via your backend instead.
[18:27:00] <specialtech> maybe thats why, cause it kept returning me to the homepage instead
[18:27:21] <specialtech> well I'm a frontend dev, and I'm just trying to get a working prototype for the backend
[18:27:21] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:27:34] <robertmaxrees> you're confused about how regex works.
[18:27:45] <robertmaxrees> you're literally comparing that string to the referrer.
[18:28:29] <robertmaxrees> like, you're saying if ("http://google.com" == "^(.*?(\bcategories\b)[^$]*)$") {}
[18:28:31] <robertmaxrees> see the issue.
[18:28:37] <robertmaxrees> you're not testing if the url matches the regex.
[18:28:44] <specialtech> ah
[18:29:19] <robertmaxrees> you could use a simple indexOf() with a simple string here instead.
[18:29:41] <robertmaxrees> or you could use something like https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test
[18:30:15] <specialtech> yea I just found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3809401/what-is-a-good-regular-expression-to-match-a-url
[18:30:26] <specialtech> I think I have a good idea of what to do now, thanks a lot!
[18:33:45] <robertmaxrees> D:
[18:33:46] <robertmaxrees> nonono
[18:33:57] <robertmaxrees> so uh
[18:34:33] <robertmaxrees> depending on your application, you should just be able to do something like document.referer.indexOf('/categories/') > -1
[18:41:24] <Bizkit> hey can someone tell me how to capture the submit event of a dynamically created form
[18:41:35] <robertmaxrees> using event delegation on the document or body.
[18:41:50] <Bizkit> you again :D
[18:41:54] <robertmaxrees> yep ;)
[18:42:02] <Bizkit> i am doing that
[18:42:12] <Bizkit> my problem is still capturing the form
[18:42:16] <robertmaxrees> your selector might be the problem.
[18:46:21] <Bizkit> robertmaxrees so what's the correct syntax to select the form by name?:D
[18:46:29] <robertmaxrees> give it a class instead.
[18:46:58] <robertmaxrees> selecting via name is gross :(
[18:47:16] <Bizkit> robertmaxrees does that still bubble down?
[18:47:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:47:49] <robertmaxrees> you mean the event?
[18:47:54] <Bizkit> yes
[18:48:12] <robertmaxrees> they "bubble up", and the selectors have nothing to do with whether or not they bubble.
[18:50:20] <robertmaxrees> Bizkit that make sense?
[18:55:01] <Bizkit> robertmaxrees yes, alright selecting via id works
[18:55:44] <robertmaxrees> awesome.  selecting via attributes is doable, but it's kind of gross and hard.
[18:57:07] <Bizkit> robertmaxrees thanks for the help, now i'll go try to find out how to make the browser back button work when i do   window.history.pushState()
[18:57:18] <robertmaxrees> err.
[18:57:22] <robertmaxrees> it already works :)
[18:57:31] <robertmaxrees> you want to hook into the popstate :)
[18:57:45] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API
[18:57:50] <robertmaxrees> and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/popstate
[19:11:02] <Bizkit> robertmaxrees can someone explain this to me like i am 5? :D
[19:11:13] <robertmaxrees> what are you lost about?
[19:13:32] <Bizkit> robertmaxrees ok so my website is a onepager that just loads stuff via ajax and then rebuilds the view now what i want to be able to do is click the back and forward buttons in the browser and get to the previews states so i am guessing i have to save the steps to get there somewhere right?
[19:14:20] <robertmaxrees> yep.  you have to store that state and then do something with it.
[19:16:26] <Bizkit> robertmaxrees can i store it in the actual history or do i need to log everything in my javascript?
[19:16:45] <robertmaxrees> fwiw all of this is supported in older browsers.
[19:16:54] <robertmaxrees> before you get too far in i figure that may be salient.
[19:18:02] <robertmaxrees> and if you read that article i linked earlier, they explaind how to store a state object.
[19:18:24] <Odesu42> Is it possible to use both attributes in this example http://pastebin.com/0xdLyqpQ in one selector, e.g. $('input[type=checkbox]...' OR 'input[type=radio]...').change(function() { ... });?
[19:18:46] <robertmaxrees> Odesu42 same way you'd do it in CSS.
[19:18:47] <robertmaxrees> a comma
[19:22:33] <Bizkit> robertmaxrees is there an easy way to log all the events i that happen on the website into the state object until pushState is called?
[19:22:46] <robertmaxrees> you have to do it manually.
[19:25:33] <Bizkit> robertmaxrees so save the function name with parameters into a variable put that into the state object and then eval them on popstate?
[19:25:43] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:25:51] <robertmaxrees> why are oyu saving function names?
[19:26:19] <Bizkit> because i want to execute that function on popstate
[19:26:38] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you do that.
[19:26:50] <robertmaxrees> you need to basically use a router.
[19:26:59] <robertmaxrees> i'd search around for a suitable framework.
[19:29:52] <Odesu42> robertmaxrees, thanks
[19:30:52] <specialtech> robertmaxrees: I tried doing it your way, with the indexOf and I'm receiving a "undefined"
[19:30:58] <robertmaxrees> specialtech show me.
[19:34:30] <specialtech> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/9L1jk12v/2/
[19:35:56] <robertmaxrees> so where are you getting "undefined"?
[19:37:06] <specialtech> when I throw that into console lol
[19:37:13] <specialtech> for the site
[19:37:43] <robertmaxrees> well, yeah.
[19:37:45] <robertmaxrees> that's expected.
[19:49:46] <specialtech> Sorry, got dc
[19:49:58] <specialtech> sorry got dc T_T
[19:49:59] <robertmaxrees> alright
[19:50:00] <specialtech> robertmaxrees
[19:50:06] <robertmaxrees> saw it the first time :)
[19:50:08] <specialtech> so them should I just implement to test?
[19:50:18] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[19:50:20] <robertmaxrees> should just work.
[19:53:02] <Bizkit> robertmaxrees i tried saving the function + parameter in the pushState and then just eval ing it on pop state and it works, i don't see where the problem is?
[19:53:15] <robertmaxrees> storing references to function is a pretty gross idea.
[19:53:27] <robertmaxrees> store data, not logic.
[19:53:31] <robertmaxrees> but whatever works (shrug)
[19:54:33] <Bizkit> robertmaxrees is there any other problem with it other then it being frowned upon due to it being unethical? :D
[19:55:09] <robertmaxrees> it's terrible practice and doing things The Right Way™ pays off.  but something tells me you're not going to listen to my advice and experience anyway sooo....
[19:55:25] <robertmaxrees> also makes for much more readable code when your router is just handling data.
[19:57:07] <Bizkit> robertmaxrees i'll listen if you give me an easy alternative that doesn't involve a framework and is pretty easy and fast to implement, my project is due on wednesday
[19:57:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:57:25] <robertmaxrees> enjoy, mano.
[20:48:39] <jeromelanteri> from an ajax event catch, i have xhr datas (who is a html code page), then from there i would like to take some part of this xhr html code for put in place in the current show view (for example, take an "input" element and put on #target id container element). I know how to put them with .html (content), but how to catch elements from xhr data ?
[20:51:06] <jeromelanteri> $(document).on('ajax:success', "#trigger", function(ev, xhr, settings) { var my_element = xhr.????? ; $("#target").html(my_element); });
[20:52:30] <ChrisBinge_> I want to create a multidimensional array where the key is named after the input from a form element. however, I need to do this on the fly and not on form submit since I will dynamically create variable form elements
[20:59:41] <jeromelanteri> ChrisBinge, what is "on the fly" ?
[21:00:58] <jeromelanteri> ChrisBinge, do you mean: dynamically at input time of data writing in input elements ?
[21:01:04] <ChrisBinge> jeromelanteri, immediately. this is because I want to use the input to create the key for the array
[21:01:12] <ChrisBinge> yeah
[21:01:55] <jeromelanteri> i think you need to use event trigger (then remote: true on elements) with jquery code
[21:02:04] <jeromelanteri> (or javascript, it is same)
[21:02:45] <ChrisBinge> not sure what you mean
[21:03:17] <jeromelanteri> the idea is that, you need a listner event on your asset/javascriptmy_object.js.erb code to handle event occur (writing in input element) to do job you need.
[21:04:01] <jeromelanteri> but for that, you need to have an event occur at time you are writing in the input (or do select a choice).
[21:04:21] <jeromelanteri> ChrisBinge, make more sens ?
[21:05:26] <ChrisBinge> jeromelanteri, conceptually I just don't know how to edit the array once the event is triggered
[21:05:41] <jeromelanteri> you are ok that rails only use his mecanism if something happen like: submit something, GET/POST request on action though a route, etc...
[21:06:10] <jeromelanteri> so need to use jquery/javascript code for do this kind of job.
[21:06:29] <jeromelanteri> the array should be (for easy use) a json data
[21:07:06] <ChrisBinge> i'm using php. I could look into converting to json though
[21:08:30] <jeromelanteri> after catch the event "i'm writing into this input", then you can do catch data input and call an ajax get through a routed url... then rails will use this action at routed url to handle a member function... then give back a result (hope a json...)
[21:09:01] <jeromelanteri> here is not php channel, i think if you use php code, the best way should be to go on php channel for ask php help.
[21:10:08] <ChrisBinge> I'm more curious about the jquery part, I just mentioned it since you brought up rails
[21:10:45] <jeromelanteri> ChrisBinge, yes, but there should have (or ot) inter-action between the framework and the jquery call...
[21:11:30] <jeromelanteri> so, for example, me... i definitly don't want to use php code. So i can not help you for inter-action between php and jquery.
[21:12:19] <jeromelanteri> ChrisBinge, also, same i'm doing now, you can ask on the jquery channel to...
[21:12:52] <ChrisBinge> i thought this was the jquery channel?
[21:12:57] <jeromelanteri> (ho my god... we are on jquery channel... i lost myself...)
[21:13:01] <jeromelanteri> lol
[21:13:05] <jeromelanteri> yes
[21:13:29] <jeromelanteri> ChrisBinge, sorry, i'm tired this morning
[21:13:52] <ChrisBinge> haha no worries
[21:14:04] <ChrisBinge> I'm working on a fiddle to make my question more clear
[21:14:20] <jeromelanteri> ChrisBinge, your question is clear
[21:14:25] <jeromelanteri> (for me)
[21:15:50] <jeromelanteri> ChrisBinge, so... you can chosse to manipulate json data inside jquery code, or use ajax mecanism for speak with your php framework, then the framewok would use a function you create on the ajax route with GET call to do the job and give back what ever you need
[21:16:32] <jeromelanteri> (i think more simple is to use ajax mecansim and your php code for manipulate the array...) look at json data container, and lookj at ajax mecanism
[21:17:01] <ChrisBinge> jeromelanteri, i think so too, working on that now
[21:17:03] <ChrisBinge> i'll update
[21:17:11] <jeromelanteri> ok
[21:18:09] <jeromelanteri> ChrisBinge, http://api.jquery.com/change/
[21:18:53] <ChrisBinge> nice, that is definitely the handler to use
[21:18:59] <ChrisBinge> jeromelanteri, thanks
[21:19:11] <jeromelanteri> happy to able to help you
[21:24:07] <jeromelanteri> ChrisBinge, and look at this (ajax example from jquery.com) for understand how to speak with your framework and send it the datas... http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR
[21:27:25] <notchris> im trying to access an array in an object
[21:27:43] <notchris> data[‘items’].front_default
[21:27:45] <notchris> did not work
[21:32:22] <bobdobbs> I'm having trouble with jQuery's css() function.  I'm working with this site: http://dradev.com/our-partners/ and the element that is selectable thus: jQuery(".page-id-201 #page-image-header")
[21:32:38] <bobdobbs> I'm trying to get and alter the background image.
[21:32:49] <bobdobbs> I've got no problem getting it. But I can't set it.
[21:33:41] <bobdobbs> To get it I do jQuery(".page-id-201 #page-image-header").css('background-image'). Or I can get all the 'background' settings with jQuery(...).css('background')
[21:33:55] <bobdobbs> But I can't set it.
[21:34:23] <bobdobbs> My test is doing things like this: jQuery(...).css('background-image', 'initial')
[21:34:48] <bobdobbs> or, even adding '!important' after 'initial.
[22:18:42] <jeromelanteri> from a text contain html code, i done parseHTMl(the_text). But then from there, how to get an element (i would like to find an element from his id, for do include it an other place)
[22:19:09] <jeromelanteri> i not find DOM node functions query
[23:48:28] <defaultyo> Hi, I need help with my page shalomlab.ph/test - below in 'Latest News' - twitter widget iframe refreshes when on focus again - how do I stop it from refreshing to blank?
