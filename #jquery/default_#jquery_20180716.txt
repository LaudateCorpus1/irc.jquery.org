[02:21:33] <Cork> so it's been there a long time :)
[03:15:01] <supernovah> hey I have this selector which returns a collection of anchors: jq('a[name]'), the offset method applied to this gives me some property 'top' but which element does it refer to and why can't I get the distance from the top of each element?
[03:16:35] <Cork> supernovah: inline elements don't have a top reference (not possible as they have possible multiple tops (if they are broken on multiple lines)
[03:17:04] <Cork> the top is referenced to the closest overflow parent
[03:17:29] <Cork> (if you use .position())
[03:17:37] <Cork> .offset() is relative to the viewport
[03:18:57] <supernovah> so how can I get the distance from the top of an anchor in the document?
[03:19:25] <supernovah> or rather I want a collection of all the anchors distances from the top, to determine if I've scrolled past them to style the menu at the top
[03:19:27] <Cork> an alternative is to convert the anchor to display: inline-block;
[03:19:51] <Cork> but note that it can cause the text in it to jump around, as inline-block don't wrap the same way inline elements does
[03:20:59] <supernovah> it has no text, it's just an anchor
[03:21:12] <supernovah> for the purposes of mapping distances from the top
[03:21:28] <supernovah> odd that the first one works, but the second gives me no top property
[03:21:35] <Cork> but you don't do that with anchors...
[03:21:41] <supernovah> how is it done then
[03:21:44] <supernovah> I'm not a web designer
[03:21:53] <Cork> by setting an id on any element
[03:22:16] <supernovah> but when you don't have JS and you have a named anchor, a #anchorName link scrolls to it without generating an XHR
[03:22:21] <Cork> anchors for link position hasn't been the correct way since early 2000
[03:22:22] <supernovah> or GET or whatever
[03:23:11] <supernovah> is that some stylistic status-quo or is it in an RFC
[03:23:30] <Cork> supernovah: https://jsfiddle.net/7taxn3Lv/
[03:24:20] <Cork> not rfc, but it is part of the html standard
[03:26:20] <supernovah> oh interesting
[11:01:06] <skinux> There must be a mistake somehow, console is telling me that jquery has an error in it.
[11:01:17] <skinux> Oh, whoops...wrong lib
[11:07:09] <rjCousineau> Hello.  I'm submitting a form and catching .on('submit', function(e){ e.preventDefault() }); but I dont understand why the form is submitting and refreshing the page. I don't understand why e.preventDefault(); is failing
[11:08:02] <rjCousineau> nevermind..
[11:11:29] <ryan_ford> you need to prevent default on click, not submit
[11:26:37] <Cork> ryan_ford: no that's wrong
[11:26:47] <Cork> most likely the event listener isn't bound to the form
[11:26:55] <Cork> (like didn't exist when the selector ran)
[11:27:27] <Cork> ryan_ford: you should avoid binding click actions for form buttons, as it breaks part of the functions for forms
[11:28:59] <ryan_ford> oops
[13:50:52] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[17:58:59] <gambl0re> hello?
