[00:25:42] <fabioportieri> your english is good enough so far
[00:27:27] <not_mike> no it isn't
[00:27:41] <not_mike> just kidding, i am a mean person
[00:29:54] <tw2113> did someone say mean people?
[00:31:21] <lenswipee> yes
[00:31:39] <lenswipee> that someone was referring to you, tw2113
[00:32:11] <lenswipee> just kidding :D
[00:45:41] <jay_> HELLO I WANT TO SEND MULTIPLE DATA i.e FORM DATA and an ID VALUE too through AJAX PHP
[00:45:43] <jay_> data: {"enqno="+ ID, $("#date_frm").serialize()}
[00:45:51] <jay_> IS THIS RIGHT?
[00:56:11] <fn> could anyone explain me what [0] in $(ë#myFormIdí)[0].reset(); stands for?
[00:58:22] <dylan9o4> hey guys, anybody on?
[01:00:43] <dylan9o4> I'm trying to figure out why this simple function doesn't affect both elements as it should, it only affects the 2nd one...
[01:03:04] <Gazpacho> I like raisins
[01:03:30] <dylan9o4> http://jsbin.com/efihob/1
[01:07:10] <systemfault> dylan9o4: Why do you think it "should" do that?
[01:07:25] <systemfault> $.extend is not for that.
[01:07:44] <systemfault> you want var all = red.add(blue);
[01:08:04] <dylan9o4> well i mean $() IS an object, but ok, I guess I;; just us add()
[01:08:11] <systemfault> Or even var all = $('#red, #blue');
[01:08:32] <dylan9o4> nope, first option is only applicable here
[01:08:36] <dylan9o4> thanks
[01:18:26] <daanavitch> why doesn't this work: http://jsfiddle.net/QXy9K/
[01:19:43] <systemfault> Define "doesn't work"
[01:19:56] <systemfault> Because your code does nothing at the moment.
[01:20:46] <systemfault> It creates a FileReader, binds the "load" event‚Ä¶ but you're not actually doing something with it
[01:22:56] <daanavitch> systemfault: so how do I make it execute the code on load?
[01:23:36] <systemfault> Usually, you want to trigger code on "domready" because "load" happens late
[01:23:52] <systemfault> With jQuery, you'd do: $(function() {    your jquery code herer });
[01:23:56] <systemfault> *here
[01:25:03] <dylan9o4> systemfault: do you know how to get the recursive children of $(this)?
[01:25:17] <systemfault> dylan9o4: .find("*") ?
[01:25:47] <dylan9o4> ah I forgot about that one
[01:27:32] <rosieres> var xSI_NET = [ "bar" ]; currentID = $(this).attr('id'); xSIvar = "x"+currentID; console.log(xSIvar[0]);
[01:27:32] <rosieres> xSIvar seems to be wrong. What do I have to change so that the array data is accessible?
[01:29:02] <xec_> rosieres: wrong in what sense? what are you trying to do?
[01:29:05] <Clex_> rosieres: xSIvar is not an array. console.log(xSIvar);
[01:29:31] <xec_> Clex_: myString[0] will return the first character of the string
[01:29:45] <xec_> which will always be "x" i suppose
[01:29:59] <rosieres> I want to have xSIvar as an array which is defined in xSI_NET
[01:30:16] <Clex_> xec_: I assume he wants an array or something.
[01:30:21] <xec_> rosieres: why? you already have it in xSI_NET?
[01:31:13] <Krambiorix> hi, i have some checkboxes all with class name "selectmessage" . I want to check how much checkboxes with that class name are checked.... Someone?
[01:31:25] <rosieres> xSI_NET is static this currentID is dynamic @ hover so I thought I need a middleware to access that array . . .
[01:31:44] <xec_> rosieres: what are you trying to do?
[01:32:03] <rosieres> xec_ i¬¥ll fiddle it
[01:35:09] <dylan9o4> systemfault: what about the best way to associate two elements, so where if one is clicked, the other will be hidden?
[01:36:00] <dylan9o4> I'm trying to do this association with 3 sets of the 2 elements all within one .click function systemfault
[01:36:30] <systemfault> Depends on the HTML
[01:36:43] <rosieres> xec_ http://jsfiddle.net/KtyQR/
[01:36:55] <lenswipee> hi, is it possible to hide HTML inside a jQuery dialog?
[01:37:29] <xec_> rosieres: what is that code supposed to do?
[01:38:07] <rosieres> xec_ show some static data on hovering a specific element
[01:38:22] <rosieres> where the specific element a SVG path is
[01:40:03] <fabioportieri> rosieres: xSIvar = []; xSIvar.push(["x" + currentId]);
[01:40:08] <niac> anyone can tell me a game framework of js
[01:40:48] <xec_> rosieres: oh i think i know what you're trying. you can't access var name of an arbitrary sting, but you can do it with object properties: http://jsfiddle.net/KtyQR/1/
[01:40:54] <dylan9o4> systemfault: they're not going to be right next to each other or anything
[01:41:44] <dylan9o4> lenswipee: .hide()?
[01:41:45] <systemfault> dylan9o4: Perhaps you could use attributes
[01:42:21] <lenswipee> dylan9o4: that hides all the dialog. Just want to hide part HTML in it.
[01:42:59] <dylan9o4> lenswipee: then you use the $(selector(.hide() to specify exactly what
[01:43:06] <systemfault> <a href="#target">LOL</a>   <div id="target">HELLO</div> $('a').on('click', function(event){ event.preventDefault(); $(this.href).hide(); });
[01:43:17] <systemfault> dylan9o4: Something more or less like that
[01:43:20] <dylan9o4> $(selector).hide()
[01:43:36] <rosieres> xec_ thank you . . .
[01:44:00] <dylan9o4> systemfault: thanks I'll look into it
[01:44:28] <ueb> hi everybody
[01:45:00] <ueb> I'm trying to open a link from a fancybox, without success...
[01:45:14] <ueb> anybody could help me please?
[01:45:28] <xec_> ?demo @ ueb
[01:45:28] <b-ot> ueb: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:45:45] <ueb> b-ot, ok thanks
[01:46:00] <xec_> ?bot @ ueb
[01:46:07] <xec_> sigh
[01:46:50] <xec_> ueb: b-ot is not a person ;)
[01:47:21] <ueb> xec_: ok, but it answered good :)
[01:47:41] <sCoRpi> ueb: but it has no feelings ;)
[01:48:11] <ueb> :)
[01:48:12] <xec_> unlike clams. clams have feelings
[01:48:50] <sCoRpi> haha xec_ - that was a weird comparison
[01:51:28] <Myrth> hi, i think i'm going crazy, please help me
[01:51:58] <Myrth> i have lib jquery.cookie.js, and i'm making sure that it initializes $.cookie, but then it just lost
[01:52:06] <Myrth> there's only one jquery.js loaded
[01:52:21] <sCoRpi> "lost" ?
[01:52:49] <xec_> ?demo @ Myrth
[01:52:49] <b-ot> Myrth: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:52:59] <Myrth> ok
[01:58:48] <Myrth> omg found it.. jquery.tools overrides jQuery object!
[02:21:47] <mikecmpbll> how can I bind an event to a select box whenever an option is selected?
[02:21:54] <mikecmpbll> even if it's the same as it was already.
[02:26:38] <Krambiorix> mikecmpbll, share some code
[02:27:03] <mikecmpbll> Krambiorix: wah? I don't have any code to share.
[02:27:33] <mikecmpbll> except <select><option val="1">One</option><option val="2">Two</option></select>
[02:27:42] <blacksheep> hi
[02:27:43] <mikecmpbll> hehh.
[02:27:52] <blacksheep> i am using jQuery ui and sortable elements
[02:28:15] <mikecmpbll> $("select").change(function() {‚Ä¶}); only seems to fire when I change the option, which makes sense.
[02:28:24] <blacksheep> i have a problem with calling ajax after dropping the traggable object
[02:28:35] <mikecmpbll> I want it to fire whenever i select an option from the select drop down, regardless of whether i'm changing the value.
[02:29:10] <blacksheep> meaby try ("select#action").bind('click change',function(){
[02:29:15] <blacksheep> it worked for me
[02:29:26] <mikecmpbll> ta blacksheep, i'll have a go.
[02:29:32] <Krambiorix> mikecmpbll, $('#mySelect').bind('click', function(){ ...
[02:29:49] <mikecmpbll> Krambiorix: i just assumed that would fire when i opened up the select
[02:29:52] <mikecmpbll> didn't actually tryit.
[02:30:12] <Krambiorix> mikecmpbll, $('#mySelect option').bind('click', function(){ ...
[02:30:41] <mikecmpbll> oh snap, that'll do it won't it. thanks ;)
[02:31:00] <danfromuk> Hi, I like the way a competitor has animated their website and trying to find something similar but different. Has anyone seen any nice examples of DIV hover animation like this one? http://www.gradwell.com/
[02:31:03] <Krambiorix> mikecmpbll, :D
[02:31:36] <Krambiorix> danfromuk, on hover add box-shadow
[02:32:08] <blacksheep> guys and which event i should use to fire ajax after releasing dragging object
[02:32:18] <Krambiorix> danfromuk, you're talking about the boxes , not about the menu, right?
[02:32:48] <Krambiorix> blacksheep, onMouseUp?
[02:33:14] <danfromuk> Krambiorix: Right, the boxes. I was thinking maybe, instead of adding a shadown, I can grow the boxes on hover. So its not identical to gradwell.
[02:33:25] <blacksheep> Krambiorix: nope
[02:33:43] <blacksheep> if fires every time i move my cursor up .... and elements are not draggable any more
[02:35:01] <Krambiorix> danfromuk, something like : $("#mydiv").hover(function(){$(this).css('width',$(this).css('width')+5);}); ?
[02:35:22] <Krambiorix> i'm not an advanced jquery user though
[02:36:24] <Krambiorix> blacksheep, check http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5758090/dragging-a-div-in-jquery-fine-when-mouse-is-slow-but-fails-on-fast-mouse-move
[02:36:44] <Krambiorix> actually i just came to ask a question myself here... But solved it :)
[02:37:51] <blacksheep> Krambiorix: thanks i've solved it (my stupid mistake) ... .mouseup
[02:38:00] <Krambiorix> blacksheep, aha!
[02:38:10] <blacksheep> :)
[02:39:14] <blacksheep> :) but if u have a button in dragging object it will also fire an ajax :) but .... its cosmetics ;)
[02:39:53] <Krambiorix> blacksheep, then on that button preventDefault ?
[02:40:33] <mikecmpbll> Krambiorix: aint no worky :( http://jsfiddle.net/mikecmpbll/FNhMn/
[02:41:38] <Krambiorix> mikecmpbll, http://jsfiddle.net/FNhMn/1/
[02:42:01] <mikecmpbll> Krambiorix: doesn't work for me?
[02:43:12] <Krambiorix> mikecmpbll, it should :D http://jsfiddle.net/FNhMn/1/
[02:43:32] <mikecmpbll> does it work for you?
[02:43:34] <Krambiorix> mikecmpbll, the jsfiddle doesn't work?  define doesn't work
[02:43:36] <Krambiorix> yes
[02:43:41] <mikecmpbll> doesn't produce any alert for me
[02:43:43] <mikecmpbll> what browser you in?
[02:43:57] <Krambiorix> mikecmpbll, FF
[02:44:01] <mikecmpbll> ok lemme try ff
[02:44:33] <mikecmpbll> yeah, works in FF, doesn't work in chrome :@
[02:45:12] <Krambiorix> mikecmpbll,  http://jsfiddle.net/FNhMn/3/    ??
[02:45:25] <mikecmpbll> nope.
[02:49:32] <Krambiorix> mikecmpbll, sry i don't know then
[02:49:55] <mikecmpbll> wah :'(. haha, no probs. probably not possible.
[02:51:01] <Krambiorix> mikecmpbll, should be possible
[02:52:16] <eugenmayer> is there anything special with hasData? using jq 1.9 and getting not a valid method ( http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.hasData/ )
[02:52:54] <eugenmayer> arg oO i complelty got it wrong..
[02:53:05] <eugenmayer> i though $(el).hasData(name)..
[02:53:19] <eugenmayer> odd signature..seriusly‚Ä¶ anyway sorry
[02:53:51] <mikecmpbll> Krambiorix: seems like chrome won't even register a click event for a select input.
[02:54:31] <Krambiorix> mikecmpbll, does change work in Chrome?
[02:54:39] <mikecmpbll> Krambiorix: yup.
[02:54:58] <Krambiorix> mikecmpbll,  maybe use click change then
[02:55:31] <mikecmpbll> Krambiorix: I need it to fire when options are selected, even if they're reselected though, so change won't suffice.
[02:56:04] <Krambiorix> mikecmpbll, i know but maybe that's enough for the chrome users :D
[02:56:29] <mikecmpbll> lmfao.
[02:57:18] <Krambiorix> mikecmpbll, never worked with chrome, sry
[02:57:33] * mikecmpbll gives up, thinks of different ways to design his UI.
[02:59:01] <Krambiorix> mikecmpbll, or wait till someone more experienced answers your question :)
[02:59:16] <mikecmpbll> i'm pretty sure it's impossible using a select, i've googled the hell out of it.
[03:00:20] <Krambiorix> mikecmpbll, even in the dark corners of the internet?
[03:00:55] <mikecmpbll> Krambiorix: nah i didn't think 4chan would have much to offer on the subject.
[03:01:02] <mikecmpbll> hehh.
[03:01:52] <Krambiorix> :p
[03:07:22] <ueb> I'm trying to open a link from a fancybox, without success...
[03:07:41] <ueb> here is my jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/cDPJ3/
[03:07:48] <ueb> as suggested by the bot :)
[03:09:21] <Krambiorix> ueb, http://jsfiddle.net/cDPJ3/1/
[03:10:09] <Krambiorix> ueb, you're italian take a ducatti :p
[03:10:17] <ueb> Krambiorix: it was the " character?!?!?!
[03:10:29] <ueb> :)
[03:10:34] <Krambiorix> ueb, yup
[03:10:40] <ueb> wow
[03:10:46] <Krambiorix> ueb , install firebug :)
[03:11:01] <ueb> thanks Krambiorix ;)
[03:11:08] <Krambiorix> ;)
[03:11:38] <ueb> what a stupid mistake...
[03:12:06] <ueb> there were too many " characters on that string...
[03:12:34] <ueb> I thought it was surely something else :))
[03:13:00] <Krambiorix> ueb, i just changed the " in window open to '
[03:13:23] <ueb> yes I saw..
[03:13:35] <ueb> however the fancybox it's not closing..
[03:14:18] <ueb> I need to make it autoclose after clicking
[03:14:35] <ueb> and the image should be opened on the same page.. not new one
[03:15:37] <ueb> Krambiorix: any idea?
[03:17:25] <ueb> fancybox does not close even if I use $.fancybox.close();
[03:20:17] <Krambiorix> ueb, checking it
[03:21:14] <ueb> Krambiorix: what?
[03:21:22] <Krambiorix> ueb, i'm checking it
[03:21:29] <ueb> ok
[03:25:13] <ueb> it opens on same page now http://jsfiddle.net/cDPJ3/2/
[03:25:30] <ueb> just added '_self'
[03:26:09] <ueb> and closes fancybox too..
[03:29:14] <Krambiorix> ueb, ow ok, i see that it closes after a timeout
[03:29:19] <Krambiorix> ueb why is that?
[03:31:07] <ueb> because this message should autoclose after some seconds
[03:33:55] <ueb> now I'll try to add an image map
[03:40:38] <ueb> here is http://jsfiddle.net/NELaM/1/
[03:41:08] <Krambiorix> ueb, i have no experience with image maps
[03:41:29] <ueb> clicking on the image does not open anything
[03:41:47] <ueb> if I try it outside the fancybox it works
[03:42:14] <ueb> so, how could I make work an image map inside fancybox ?
[03:43:55] <hxm> hello I have this,  <button id="user">Reg&iacute;strate</button> <button id="select">H</button> which is a select button, and I want change the text of #user after the user logins, but the html result creates a <span class="ui-button-text">text</span>
[03:44:08] <ueb> here is a fidlle of someone who tried to use an image map "before" opening the fancybox http://jsfiddle.net/ffZ7B/
[03:44:18] <hxm> so I use $("#user.ui-button-text").html('test') for change the content and nothing happens
[03:44:21] <hxm> how can I change it?
[03:44:49] <hxm> ah, an space
[03:44:51] <hxm> lol sorry
[03:45:03] <Krambiorix> ueb, without the fancybox , i can't see your image map
[03:45:57] <Krambiorix> ueb, sry no idea
[03:46:20] <Krambiorix> hxm :D
[03:46:21] <ueb> I sent you the image map without fancybox
[03:46:40] <ueb> as you can see it works
[03:46:50] <Krambiorix> ueb, the image map is on the whole image i think
[03:47:27] <ueb> try clicking the yellow button "clicca qui"
[03:48:07] <ueb> perhaps I should use an onclick event on each "area" tag
[03:48:36] <ueb> calling "javascript:window.open(url,'_self');"
[03:51:20] <Krambiorix> ueb, no idea, sry
[03:53:40] <ueb> ok it works :) http://jsfiddle.net/NELaM/2/
[03:56:56] <Krambiorix> ueb, great

[04:11:45] <jlebrech> why do i get this error? https://gist.github.com/jlebrech/34f920d9bcca956da47f
[04:12:41] <Krambiorix> jlebrech, because assigned_ids is an object and not an array?
[04:14:25] <jlebrech> looks like an array
[04:14:30] <jlebrech> [42,43]
[04:25:36] <jlebrech> you have to do .get() after map

[04:42:29] <uemak> Is it possible to load an external xml file with jQuery? This http://pastebin.com/fFwZAzxs returns Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :  on line 4
[04:43:19] <uemak> oh lol
[04:43:22] <uemak> I competely missed the ajax
[04:47:22] <xec_> jlebrech: you could use $.map(...) instead of $(...).map()
[04:47:43] <jlebrech> i see
[04:49:51] <uemak> Can you do cross domain ajax calls without involving PHP?
[04:50:20] <xec_> what does php have to do with it?
[04:50:46] <uemak> am searching the nets
[04:51:54] <uemak> JSONP
[04:52:59] <xec_> jsonp doesn't really have anything to do with php, other than the fact that jsonp *can* be implemented using php... if that's what you're asking :)
[04:54:01] <uemak> xec_: there is no way to get a xml file from another domain without using php aint there?
[04:55:03] <xec_> what
[04:56:05] <uemak> xec_: what dont you understand? I need to get data fields from an xml file on another domain.
[04:57:05] <xec_> if by "php" you mean "server-side tech on my server" then that surely is one way to do it that will work. but then it is not a "cross domain ajax call"
[04:59:22] <sekyms> Im trying to create a qUnit test that tests that a dialog has gone away on button press.  The first test spawns the dialog and that is an asyncTest, the problem is the fade away happens over time so I need to set another timeout to check if it is there in a given amount of time, but apparently you can't put a second assertion inside of a set timeout
[04:59:27] <xec_> s/my server/my domain
[05:05:23] <sekyms> wish there was a wait command in qunit

[05:20:29] <gswain> hey guys how would i go about making a dependent drop down?
[05:20:55] <gswain> where i have one drop down , that depends on the value of another, I've been trying to google this but just don't know what to look for evidenty
[05:22:18] <verism> boytoy: that plugin has an after callback you could easily use to test for a data attribute
[05:22:49] <verism> no need to simulate
[05:25:43] <_pash> hello, i have a fixed div with overflow scroll, but when that scroller scrolls to the end of div, it starts automatically scrolling the whole page, can i disable that?
[05:36:04] <fn> does anyone had experience with submit()? maybe the difference between submit form by clicking the button and/or enter on keyboard?
[05:36:04] <boytoy> verism: hey!
[05:36:22] <boytoy> verism: awesome man thats a great idea!
[05:37:06] <verism> no prob - they're handy things
[05:37:22] <boytoy> verism: is there an equally awesome solution for pausing the slider too you think?
[05:37:48] <boytoy> yup, wasnt sure why all these plugins had after callbacks like that until now so.. pretty cool..
[05:39:39] <verism> looking at the options, it oesn't look there's anything built-in
[05:39:42] <verism> *d
[05:40:59] <boytoy> oh.. hmm.. so maybe i'd have to simulate a hover then to make it pause?
[05:41:58] <verism> perhaps... although looking at the plugin source, there should be a more succinct way
[05:42:07] <verism> just not sure how
[05:42:30] <boytoy> it seems to have a pause button, perhaps i could click that instead of simulating a hover?
[05:42:41] <computer2000> is this possible without javascript: i want to apply different rules to elements depending on their number, so if a container has three images, apply these rules, if it has two images, apply other rules, how can i do that?
[05:49:06] <fabioportieri> with javascript
[05:52:13] <sekyms> Does the UI Dialog trigger close as soon as it starts to close or once the animation is finished?
[05:57:34] <crak> hi all
[05:58:49] <crak> is it possible to get the current selected <option> in an multiple select, when $('body').on('change'... ?
[05:59:26] <fn> why should it not?
[05:59:30] <crak> i don't want to get all values
[05:59:40] <crak> just the latest added
[05:59:52] <crak> fn: can you tell me how?
[06:00:26] <crak> fn: using event.data.value does not work for me
[06:02:32] <Thoams> can't for the life of me get this hover event to .stopPropagation
[06:02:48] <Thoams> even checking if this == ev.target is failcity
[06:03:03] <Thoams> child element must not fire parent hover
[06:03:08] <Thoams> else bad times
[06:03:17] <fn> crak: put all selection in an array
[06:03:40] <crak> fn: and?
[06:10:57] <dan2k3k4> how can I replace all newlines/spaces/tabs etc. from a string ?
[06:11:51] <dan2k3k4> str.split(/[ ,]+/).join(','); doesn't seem to work
[06:12:12] <dan2k3k4> the regex matches for spaces and commas? but not tabs or newlines?
[06:13:02] <lhunath> is it possible to get the position of an element relative to a given parent, rather than just the offset parent?
[06:13:25] <lhunath> or, translate a position in the coordinate system of element x into that of element y?
[06:13:56] <dan2k3k4> str.split(/(\r\n|\n|\r)|[ ,]+/gm).join(',');
[06:13:59] <dan2k3k4> ?
[06:14:18] <Koopz> so... does anyone know a jquery plugin for form generating? I'm not looking for a website or a program... just a plugin which i can implement into my project
[06:17:20] <lhunath> try html?
[06:19:53] <Koopz> ... i want a jquery plugin for a simple reason...
[06:19:54] <Thoams> ^ note to self: helps if you do it properly
[06:20:17] <Koopz> i want my users to create and edit forms themselves...
[06:20:49] <christo_m> Hello,  i have a click handler bound to a tr, but i would like to ignore all links that are inside said tr, how would i go about doing this
[06:21:15] <christo_m> basically whats happening is im clicking a link and its doing whats its doing but its also doing the tr click handle
[06:21:18] <christo_m> sorry, td*
[06:21:28] <tobiasgreen> hmm
[06:21:34] <tobiasgreen> you can check what kind of element is it
[06:21:39] <tobiasgreen> and then ignore the action?
[06:21:51] <christo_m> tobiasgreen: check what element it is? how
[06:21:55] <christo_m> typeof?
[06:21:56] <tobiasgreen> $("#elementId").is("input")
[06:21:59] <tobiasgreen> ie
[06:21:59] <christo_m> oh
[06:22:12] <tobiasgreen> if ( $(this).is("a") )
[06:22:37] <tobiasgreen> or you could even simple is to put an event.stopPropogation into the a click
[06:22:42] <xec_> if (this.tagName == "a") ?
[06:22:45] <tobiasgreen> so it doesn't bubble up
[06:22:57] <tobiasgreen> (I think)
[06:23:21] <tobiasgreen> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/608410/finding-the-type-of-an-element-using-jquery
[06:24:41] <christo_m> ya the clicks only returning the td
[06:24:44] <christo_m> because its bound to the td
[06:25:06] <_pash> hello, i have a fixed div with overflow scroll, but when that scroller scrolls to the end of div, it starts automatically scrolling the whole page, can i disable that?
[06:25:48] <christo_m> tobiasgreen: how do i check what im clicking
[06:26:56] <Koopz> so... noone knows a goog jquery wysiwyg form building plugin which i can integrate into my website?

[07:15:37] <FloLeBlanc> hi all
[07:17:18] <Krambiorix> FloLeBlanc, hi Flo
[07:17:43] <FloLeBlanc> I'm trying to change a link inside a div and while myelement.after(newlink); works well - myelement.innerHTML = newlink does not change the link in the element - any hint on why that could be that way?
[07:18:48] <FloLeBlanc> ah if I use .html() it works - but what's the difference between html() and innerHTML
[07:36:24] <Bloomberg> Morning guys!!
[07:36:30] <slick-> hi friends
[07:36:42] <Bloomberg> I have  a problem with JQuery fancybox plugin!!
[07:36:52] <Krambiorix> another one...
[07:37:16] <Bloomberg> All works ok, but the second time that I open a window show me  ::  .fancybox is not afunction
[07:37:20] <Bloomberg> a function*
[07:38:22] <Krambiorix> Bloomberg, code...
[07:40:00] <Bloomberg> For example there are a list of items (3), you want that each one element open a different window, so you're going to open the first element. Ok, but when you close your window without reload it and you try to open another window, you get this error
[07:40:34] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/oxiyev/1/edit
[07:43:28] <slick-> folks
[07:43:34] <slick-> i need something like a query spreadsheet app
[07:43:36] <_pash> hello, i have a fixed div with overflow scroll, but when that scroller scrolls to the end of div, it starts automatically scrolling the whole page, can i disable that?
[07:43:37] <slick-> with drop down menus
[07:43:42] <slick-> and ability to add new ros
[07:43:44] <slick-> rows
[07:43:57] <Krambiorix> Bloomberg, i checked it, but with my limited experience i should say: i have no idea
[07:44:31] <Krambiorix> _pash, what do you mean: it starts automatically scrolling the whole page?
[07:45:26] <_pash> Krambiorix: once the user reaches the end of the div, and continues scrolling with the mousewheel, the whole html page starts scrolling
[07:46:04] <Krambiorix> _pash, that's normal, no?
[07:46:14] <_pash> Krambiorix: yes, i want to prevent this
[07:46:46] <_pash> Krambiorix: could you help me please, also this div is a fixed div
[07:46:47] <jlebrech> if i have mouse down on a element can i initialise a grag event?
[07:46:52] <jlebrech> drag*
[07:47:42] <_pash> Krambiorix: something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/XNwbt/1/ but this doesnt seem to work on a fixed div
[07:49:34] <Krambiorix> _pash, that div in your jsfiddle doesn't even scroll
[07:50:05] <_pash> it does for me.. Krambiorix thats what i need help with =)
[07:50:20] <verism> it scrolls - just the wrong way
[07:50:54] <verism> apart from that, it seems to working as you want it
[07:51:36] <_pash> verism: that is not my example. it is from here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7600454/how-to-prevent-page-scrolling-when-scrolling-a-div-element I cant get it to work on my page
[07:52:15] <innociv> How do I match only the foo without "s" at the end? IE "I foos all the foo" with regex?  I only want to match foos that aren't plural. But fooed is fine, and so is foobar, or whatever else.  I'd expect something like /^(foo!s)+$/ but that's not
[07:53:27] <verism> can you paste your own fiddle?
[07:54:04] <_pash> verism: one sec
[08:00:55] <_pash> verism: here: http://jsfiddle.net/zxp8G/1/
[08:01:12] <cocotton> o/
[08:03:01] <cocotton> Hey guys I'm having a little issue with the ".off" even handler. I have a button that when clicked, is set to "off". But then, if I reclick on it, there seem to be a problem and I get redirected on the main page of my website. Has anyone in here ever had a similar problem? (I can paste my code if needed be)
[08:04:55] <sekyms> you should probably set the click to do an preventDefault
[08:05:17] <cocotton> I'll go read on that right now and come back to tell my results :)
[08:05:26] <verism> _pash: looks as though this may nly be solved with a plugin - check out https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel
[08:06:02] <verism> there are a load of browser inconsistencies when dealing with scroll bubbling
[08:07:02] <verism> here's an example http://jsbin.com/ixura3/3
[08:07:57] <Bloomberg> How can I to do a counter with jquery?
[08:08:08] <Bloomberg> for example later of 10 seg do this!!
[08:08:10] <slick-> $i = $i + 1
[08:08:56] <ibc> hi, is it possible to add a event to a dom element that prevents previous events of being called?
[08:10:16] <_pash> verism: thanks, ill take a look. that last example you sent me, it doesnt seem to work, it scrolls the page
[08:11:02] <ibc> this is:
[08:11:02] <ibc> $('#foo').click( functionA)
[08:11:02] <ibc> now I need to temporaly disable functionA (without using unbind) so, can I add a new evet whose body avoids   functionA being called? this is:
[08:11:02] <ibc> $('#foo').click( function(){
[08:11:02] <ibc>   # here something that makes jQuery to not call functionAfor this element/event
[08:11:03] <ibc> })
[08:11:05] <verism> works here on chrome
[08:11:21] <verism> but yeah - not a straightforward solution afaik
[08:12:32] <_pash> verism: i am on chrome too
[08:12:52] <_pash> verism: works in safari though
[08:13:08] <verism> http://jsfiddle.net/zxp8G/2/
[08:13:13] <verism> does this work for you?
[08:18:11] <verism> _pash: ^
[08:19:31] <_pash> verism: one sec
[08:19:38] <_pash> verism: nope
[08:38:41] <DoctorMonocular_> hey everyone
[08:39:55] <DoctorMonocular_> I have a form submit handler that I want to do some stuff, delay a little, then let the form submission go through. I submit the form with a line like $form.delay(100).submit(); The problem is that that call to submit is firing the event again, so it's an infinite loop. How can I stop that?
[08:52:27] <zzizz> Hey guys, rookie here, I have this simple hover code that works http://jsfiddle.net/hd9ys/ but I also want to add a css class to those items that are being hovered, can I do this within this code or will it break it ?
[08:54:03] <Zzaichik> zzizz: shouldn't break it, use .addClass() / .removeClass() -  and you can test it out in jsfiddle to make sure.
[08:54:09] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/ugipab/1/edit
[08:54:49] <zzizz> Zzaichik -> tried and broke it http://jsfiddle.net/hd9ys/1/
[08:55:01] <zzizz> oh didn't do remove class but ya
[08:55:04] <Bloomberg> I just want that later of 5 seg my page go down 87 px for hide the header, but the problem is that continue go downing and never stop
[08:55:22] <Zzaichik> zzizz: inside the function yo
[08:55:27] <Zzaichik> functionS
[08:55:39] <Joel> I've selected an element by class, how can I get a child element of the first element by class?
[08:56:16] <zzizz> zzaichik makes sense hold on
[08:58:07] <Joel> ahh got it, .children('.the_class')
[08:58:20] <wild_oscar> with the datepicker, is it possible to restrict the format that can be written with the keyboard?
[08:58:36] <NoiseEee> Joel: that'll give you one-level deep only, so keep that in mind
[08:58:44] <Joel> NoiseEee: yeah, that's fine for me.
[08:58:56] <wild_oscar> in http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#default you can't write text in the field, but nothing prevents you from writing 99/99/99
[08:59:02] <Zzaichik> .children().children().children().children().children()     Just kidding, dont' do that.
[08:59:27] <wild_oscar> how could you prevent writing anything but a date in the yyyy-MM--dd format?
[09:00:40] <gnarf> DoctorMonocular_: a: that delay does nothing
[09:00:50] <gnarf> DoctorMonocular_: setTimeout(function() { $form.submit() }, 100)
[09:01:25] <gnarf> DoctorMonocular_: b: it will indeed trigger the event you bound, you can either: .off() the event handler, or set some var that you keep in scope and return early from the event handler if it is set
[09:23:49] <Emn1ty|Work>  anyone know why this is skipping slides? http://jsfiddle.net/GAnhB/5/
[09:23:50] <banister`shop> anyone here speak chinese?
[09:25:34] <Emn1ty|Work> well, I figured out a way around it...
[09:49:30] <Emn1ty|Work> now I'm wondering why the same code on my fiddle doesn't work localy :\
[09:50:12] <Bloomberg> how can I use this in JQuery fancybox plugin  ::   $.fancybox.close
[09:51:36] <Maffelu> If I have a bunch of divs with a whole lot of different classes, is there a function for getting all those classes in an array or do I have to loop through them all myself?
[09:54:05] <thaifood> Can't get css property to work on jQuery tabs.  Line 17 is not resizing  http://fpaste.org/17250/24006137/   Any ideas gents ?
[09:54:59] <thaifood> is it because the document ready is added from a script?  <script src="resize.php" type="text/javascript"></script>
[09:55:47] <thaifood> nope, just tested that
[09:56:01] <thaifood> doh i had the id wrong !
[09:56:40] <Krambiorix> thaifood, S in id
[09:56:45] <thaifood> i so stupid
[09:56:49] <thaifood> thanks Krambiorix
[09:56:53] <thaifood> snow blind
[09:57:03] <Krambiorix> thaifood, you're thai?
[09:57:10] <thaifood> no i'm food :-)
[09:57:16] <Krambiorix> :p
[09:57:28] <thaifood> though i just ate mexican
[09:57:31] <Emn1ty|Work> blindMoe, http://jsfiddle.net/GAnhB/6/ - getting closer but now it's got a weird shifting going on. Unfortunately this thing resizes to the smallest image height :\
[09:57:54] <blindMoe> oh wow.. still going on it eh? :)
[09:58:11] <Emn1ty|Work> yeah
[09:58:20] <Emn1ty|Work> its... been interesting
[09:59:11] <Krambiorix> thaifood, you like thai food then ey?
[09:59:17] <Emn1ty|Work> blindMoe, but I can get the opacity stuff working - http://jsfiddle.net/GAnhB/7/
[09:59:19] <thaifood> love it :-)
[09:59:31] <Krambiorix> i almost eat it everyday, bit bored with it
[09:59:34] <Krambiorix> :D
[09:59:41] <thaifood> just had a ton of cilantro on my mexican to help me get through
[09:59:43] <thaifood> hahaha
[09:59:47] <thaifood> are you thai ?
[10:00:00] <blindMoe> Emn1ty|Work: didn't you want more than one visible at a time?
[10:00:04] <Krambiorix> no, my wife is
[10:00:13] <Emn1ty|Work> blindMoe, yes
[10:00:13] <thaifood> even better
[10:00:20] <thaifood> get a new wife !
[10:00:21] <Krambiorix> a mexican
[10:00:22] <Krambiorix> :p
[10:00:28] <thaifood> haha
[10:00:28] <Emn1ty|Work> but the moment I center the active slide with their API it gets this weird padding and I can't seem to show more than one
[10:00:46] <Emn1ty|Work> if I remove the padding the active slide is no longer the center slide
[10:01:17] <Emn1ty|Work> which is odd, since their website clearly shows they are doing it fine...
[10:01:27] <Emn1ty|Work> and I literally copied the code from their site
[10:03:07] <Emn1ty|Work> the weird thing is, nothing is telling their sliders to be centered :\
[10:05:59] <machty> I'm getting this in 1.9.1: unrecognized expression: script[src*=jquery.refinery.wymeditor]
[10:06:09] <machty> does that seem like a bad/deprecated expression?
[10:06:16] <machty> it's not a direct query, but internal to some wymeditor code
[10:06:34] <Emn1ty|Work> blindMoe, what's bugging me is that all their sliders are centered... yet there's no documentation or code that explains it
[10:06:42] <ajmrsn> what is the main difference between 1.8.3 and 1.9.1 that breaks many websites?
[10:07:13] <ajmrsn> I can't give much of an example other than when I tried updating jquery the only newest version that I could upgrade to was 1.8.3
[10:07:25] <ajmrsn> would that be due to additional plugins the site might be using?
[10:07:40] <Emn1ty|Work> blindMoe, there is this page - http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/demo/center.php, but none of their slides actually have those data attributes...
[10:11:04] <Emn1ty|Work> blindMoe, and even better. I can't even get the slider to work locally...
[10:11:11] <blindMoe> really?
[10:11:13] <blindMoe> that is odd
[10:11:18] <Emn1ty|Work> it doesn't even error and all the JS works
[10:11:19] <blindMoe> no errors in your error console?
[10:11:21] <Emn1ty|Work> but no slides
[10:11:35] <blindMoe> probably a css issue
[10:11:49] <blindMoe> have you tried inspecting the elements to see how tall the container is?
[10:12:07] <Emn1ty|Work> 200px
[10:12:56] <Emn1ty|Work> hm... the width is 0
[10:13:35] <Emn1ty|Work> ok, local is working now but I have to set the width on this one...
[10:13:49] <Emn1ty|Work> which... makes little sense
[10:14:35] <Emn1ty|Work> why does this have to be so damned difficult?
[10:14:46] <blindMoe> hehe
[10:14:58] <Emn1ty|Work> it's such a simple effect
[10:15:03] <blindMoe> what is that site that has the example you wanted?
[10:16:09] <Emn1ty|Work> http://www.jcoverflip.com/demo
[10:16:54] <Emn1ty|Work> the only reason I don't use that one is because it requires jquery UI for that draggable slider thing, which is poorly done
[10:18:10] <jedimind> why
[10:18:28] <Emn1ty|Work> ?
[10:18:54] <jedimind> why would you want to do that effect
[10:19:09] <jedimind> ive literally never seen a coverflow that was useful
[10:19:32] <jedimind> sorry i'm apparently more opinionated on fridays
[10:19:50] <Emn1ty|Work> Basically, I have a login screen for each of our web tools. I want to put the logos for each at the top, and they can click left/right to choose the one they log into.
[10:20:13] <Emn1ty|Work> that's why I want actual left/right arrows
[10:20:25] <Emn1ty|Work> so the visual effect is all I want
[10:20:26] <jedimind> yeah dont use cover flow
[10:20:37] <jedimind> if this is a web tool, dont interfere
[10:20:39] <jedimind> simple is better
[10:20:47] <Emn1ty|Work> ...
[10:20:53] <jedimind> list them all at once, make it a single click
[10:21:00] <Emn1ty|Work> there's a difference between what I should do and what I've been asked to do
[10:21:15] <jedimind> do you have absolutely no opportunity to say "i think this is a bad idea?"
[10:21:20] <jedimind> or do you just do monkey work?
[10:21:22] <jedimind> sorry
[10:21:23] <jedimind> fuck
[10:21:30] <jedimind> im being a dick
[10:21:39] <Emn1ty|Work> jedimind, my boss is easily polarized
[10:22:00] <Emn1ty|Work> I've gotten to a point where I just make it the way he wants it or else we go around in circles...
[10:22:21] <Emn1ty|Work> because "dealers like shiny"
[10:23:36] <Emn1ty|Work> we want, functionally, a similar thing to Google's apps where you can easily log into any of them at any time. But we don't have it set up yet for global logins
[10:23:55] <Emn1ty|Work> so we want a way for them to choose which one they log into, but have it focus the correct one based on domain.
[10:24:03] <Emn1ty|Work> since they are all hosted on seperate domains
[10:24:18] <jedimind> i understand, i just dont agree that coverflow is the way to go, i mean take google example that you just pointed out
[10:24:23] <jedimind> clear, straight forward list of things
[10:24:30] <jedimind> no clicking on arrows to get to what you want to do
[10:24:30] <Emn1ty|Work> I know
[10:24:35] <Emn1ty|Work> and I agree with that approach
[10:24:35] <jedimind> anyway, im beating a dead horse
[10:24:55] <Emn1ty|Work> but every time I do that, he tells me "it's not enough"
[10:25:04] <jedimind> you need a better job :)
[10:25:05] <Eviltwin> http://addyosmani.com/resources/coverflow/demo/demo.html ?
[10:25:12] <Emn1ty|Work> the job is fine, the person is the hard part
[10:25:22] <jedimind> yeah but thats a big part of the job
[10:25:35] <Emn1ty|Work> yeah... trust me I've been thinking about that stuff
[10:25:51] <Emn1ty|Work> Eviltwin, not quite
[10:26:07] <jedimind> what is that coverflow lacking that you need ?
[10:26:11] <jedimind> are you trying to find one without a slider?
[10:26:13] <jedimind> just < > arrows
[10:26:28] <jedimind> (missed the beginning of this inquest)
[10:26:28] <Emn1ty|Work> anyways, I think i'll just give up and do this: http://bxslider.com/examples/carousel-demystified#example4
[10:26:37] <thang> shit Emn1ty|Work youre still on this?
[10:26:42] <Emn1ty|Work> lol
[10:27:00] <Emn1ty|Work> it is apparently a difficult thing to accomplish
[10:27:10] <Eviltwin> I still don't know what the thing is
[10:27:13] <Eviltwin> I just heard coverflow
[10:27:30] <Emn1ty|Work> http://www.jcoverflip.com/demo
[10:27:42] <sopben> Hey all. I want to count the number of list items, divide the total by 3, and then add wrap items into the proper number of groups/columns. Almost what this is doing http://www.madeincima.it/download/samples/jquery/easyListSplitter/ - but I don't know how many columns I will need
[10:28:07] <sopben> Anyone come across an existing plugin for that type of thang?
[10:28:18] <thang> Emn1ty|Work: the one posted by Eviltwin seems like it could accomplish the same thing though
[10:28:49] <Emn1ty|Work> thang I want the navigation arrows as was said
[10:28:57] <Emn1ty|Work> a general slider with that visual effect
[10:29:02] <sopben> lol, didn't mean to ping ya thang. oops ;)
[10:29:52] <Emn1ty|Work> but I'm gonna just give up on it if others think it's a bad idea to even try this...
[10:32:02] <Croves> Hi guys! I need to pass a variable to other event. Is that possible? Here in my code I need to send that var id to on('show') method http://pastebin.com/AibMrPJv
[10:33:33] <Emn1ty|Work> thang, jedimind and blindMoe thanks for the help and suggestions btw
[10:33:59] <thang> just keep swimming
[10:34:35] <blindMoe> Emn1ty|Work: I think you can pull this off... I would probably just write my own at this point though
[10:34:52] <Emn1ty|Work> yeah, and I can't take the time to do that after spending this much already
[10:34:58] <Emn1ty|Work> so gonna cut my losses and move on
[10:35:07] <thang> sopben: do you mean the # of columns is going to be the total/3 ?
[10:35:16] <Eviltwin> Croves: Does a click on that always trigger a show?
[10:35:24] <Eviltwin> Croves: Is that click the only thing that can trigger a show?
[10:35:37] <jedimind> Emn1ty|Work <3
[10:35:41] <sopben> thang, The columns is the unknown. I know that I want three list items per column
[10:35:52] <Croves> Eviltwin: yes...
[10:35:58] <Croves> I'm using twitter bootstrap
[10:36:39] <sopben> so, the script would find the total numbers of list items, divide it by three to determine the number of columns, then go back and make those columns
[10:36:48] <Eviltwin> Croves: So why doesn't the click simply do the Ajax?
[10:36:58] <sopben> I am going to see if I can learn from the plugin I linked above...
[10:37:09] <sopben> It's nearly the same idea
[10:37:17] <sopben> Just solving for a different value
[10:37:29] <thang> sopben: wouldnt the number of columns be ceil(total/3) ?
[10:37:55] <sopben> Yes‚Ä¶what function should I use to get total?
[10:37:59] <thang> oh
[10:38:07] <thang> one moment
[10:38:09] <sopben> I did each and incremented
[10:38:25] <sopben> but, then I was trying to figure out how to pass that value on
[10:38:33] <sopben> I can look into this more
[10:39:10] <Croves> Eviltwin: Well, I need to call the ajax, get the response and show it in the modal
[10:39:35] <thang> sopben: if you use a specific selector (eg ul > li.foo) you can just apply length, like $('ul > li.foo').length
[10:39:55] <Eviltwin> Croves: And that con't be done from the .on('click') handler?
[10:39:57] <sopben> Length...right!
[10:39:59] <sopben> duh!
[10:40:07] <sopben> dang
[10:40:13] <sopben> Thanks thang. I will give this a go
[10:40:25] <Croves> Eviltwin: Oh Jesus... I am so dumb
[10:40:30] <thang> („Å•ÔΩ°‚óï‚Äø‚Äø‚óïÔΩ°)„Å•
[10:40:33] <Croves> Damn some brain cells just wake up...
[10:40:41] <Croves> Sorry for that, I was thinking in the wrong way :P
[10:59:35] <amph1bius> https://gist.github.com/ahokg/22f4a3057e17e69249ba
[10:59:44] <amph1bius> whats the proper way to escape these nested single double quotes
[11:05:51] <BillCriswell> amph1bius: \"
[11:07:38] <BillCriswell> amph1bius: I find this a bit easier to read, but it seems weird to have to do this. var f = '<a href="#" ng-click="loadPage(\'http://localhost/foobar\', $event)">foobar</a>";
[11:07:46] <Croves> Hey, I'm doing $(this).parents()[1].attr('data-search'); but Firebug says TypeError: $(...).parents(...)[1].attr is not a function
[11:08:06] <BillCriswell> Croves: Do you just want the first parent?
[11:08:42] <Croves> BillCriswell: Actualy, $(this) is a tbody line, and I need to get the 'data-search' in table declaration
[11:09:11] <Croves> $('.clickable tbody tr').on('click', function() { $(this).parents()[1].attr('data-search'); }
[11:09:12] <BillCriswell> Croves: I'd do $(this).closest('table').data('search')
[11:10:20] <Croves> BillCriswell: Yeah! When using closest(), it works
[11:10:25] <BillCriswell> Croves: Sweet.
[11:10:41] <BillCriswell> The parents()[1] would return something you definitely don't want.
[11:11:06] <Croves> Well, thank you, BillCriswell =)
[11:11:10] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[11:14:15] <boytoy> Anybody know how to manually pause ResponsiveSlider? I need to pause it if this slide has data-kitten="pause": http://jsfiddle.net/7n3GC/
[11:14:18] <boytoy> Not sure what to do. Perhaps faking a hover over it?
[11:18:20] <ecky--ptang-zoob> how come this doesn't work? http://pastebin.com/int9bNWJ - I want the text to toggle between "more stats" and "less stats"
[11:18:30] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but the text disappears after I click it
[11:20:34] <BillCriswell> boytoy: Eh, it probably wouldn't be pretty
[11:20:42] <relipse>  but is there a way to do this: http://jsbin.com/udigof/1 in jquery?
[11:22:48] <boytoy> BillCriswell: I think you're right
[11:23:21] <blindMoe> relipse: You mean a drop down menu?
[11:23:29] <relipse> sure
[11:23:35] <blindMoe> of course you could
[11:24:15] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know why this jQ animation isn't working correctly? Line 157,158. When I put them in the console by myself, it appears to work fine. Anybody know why? - http://www.decorgroupinc.com/store/builders/door-new/
[11:28:21] <BillCriswell> boytoy: http://jsfiddle.net/7n3GC/1/ should get you pretty close if not working.
[11:30:06] <BillCriswell> boytoy: The docs say you pause it on hover if pause: 1, so what I did was grab the active slide, take a look at the data-kitten and trigger mouseover on it if it has "pause"
[11:33:35] <DeltaHeavy> The line I'm talking about is menu.js
[11:36:06] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Are you trying to run it before the element is created?
[11:36:18] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: Nope
[11:36:27] <DeltaHeavy> The element is created on load.
[11:37:27] <DeltaHeavy> I console.log()'d strings of the 2 commands being run with the variables parsed into them RIGHT before they're run. It seems to run fun - $('#menu_0 .menu-section').animate({ 'height': 0 });$('#menu_2 .menu-section').animate({ 'height': 450 });
[11:37:45] <DeltaHeavy> #menu_0, just goes to 0 instantly
[11:37:52] <scar> if i want to use datepicker on a mobile, what is the best way?
[11:38:34] <BillCriswell> scar: I like <input type="date"> to be honest haha
[11:39:13] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: How can I trigger when the animation is supposed to happen?
[11:39:43] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: Click on a door type, then click on one of the buttons (no images on them yet but hover around), then click 'next'
[11:39:48] <scar> BillCriswell, how can i define how it displays the date?
[11:40:33] <BillCriswell> scar: http://html5doctor.com/html5-forms-input-types/ has a nice list.
[11:45:31] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Having a hard time following what's going on.
[11:45:45] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: What's confusing you right now? Everything more or less?
[11:45:53] <BillCriswell> Haha, yes.
[11:46:42] <DeltaHeavy> Ok, so menu.js is responsible for all menu type stuff. Lines 164 and 165 are responsible for the animation in question.
[11:47:06] <DeltaHeavy> When these are ran, they're parsed like this - $('#menu_0 .menu-section').animate({ 'height': 0 });        $('#menu_2 .menu-section').animate({ 'height': 450 });
[11:47:31] <DeltaHeavy> However, #menu_0 seems to just instantly go to a height of '0', where #menu_2, animates as expected
[11:47:56] <DeltaHeavy> Whenever I copy paste the following line into my console, it works as expected - $('#menu_0 .menu-section').animate({ 'height': 0 });$('#menu_2 .menu-section').animate({ 'height': 450 });
[11:48:27] <DeltaHeavy> So I'm confused as to why when I click the .next button, the height of #menu_0 is instantly '0'
[11:50:10] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: Does that make sense now?
[11:57:21] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Sorry had soemone come in asking me about a project.
[11:57:23] <BillCriswell> Damn work.
[11:57:35] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: No problem :p Same boat
[11:58:02] <BillCriswell> so it's just that height: 0 that's not animating?
[11:58:39] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: Yep
[11:59:32] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: What if you try specifying "slow" or change the height to 1?
[12:00:09] <gates_> Is it possible to check if $ is assigned it jQuery
[12:00:58] <cayley> Hi everyone, I need some help with an ajax issue:
[12:01:35] <cayley> I make a PUT request, the server fails or the request times out, I try to make a second request to retry and as far as I can tell a new ajax object is created but no network request is ever made.
[12:01:35] <cayley> Same behaviour in FF & Chrome.
[12:01:39] <cayley> any ideas? anyone seen anything like this?
[12:02:31] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: Just did that
[12:02:33] <DeltaHeavy> It's on the live version now
[12:03:25] <DeltaHeavy> Not working still =/
[12:07:04] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Hmmm
[12:11:00] <dogarrhea> how do you debug timing issues in js?  if i have two timeout functions and they are supposed to execute at some time in the future, say 200 ms and these timeouts are executing sequentially, how would I debug the randomness of this?
[12:11:14] <dogarrhea> ie, how would i find the two timeout functions being called simultaneously
[12:11:23] <dogarrhea> maybe they're in different js files across 200 different js files
[12:11:44] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: http://pastie.org/pastes/8020433/text how about this?
[12:11:59] <BillCriswell> Just kind of trying random shit since I'm not sure haha
[12:12:21] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Looking at the console both are animating. It's just not looking like it.
[12:13:35] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: Same results with it not animating =/
[12:14:11] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: It is animating though, look at the element in the console as you click next.
[12:14:41] <relipse> any jquery-ui gurus here?
[12:15:19] <relipse> how do i get the icon to show on the right side of the button: .button({icons: {
[12:15:19] <relipse>                   primary: "ui-icon-triangle-1-s"
[12:15:19] <relipse>                 }})
[12:15:24] <relipse> sorry meant to one-line it
[12:15:31] <jedimind> tsk tsk
[12:16:01] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: I pushed it live, you can check it out
[12:16:13] <DeltaHeavy> I'm going to actually remove the animation of #menu_2
[12:16:13] <BillCriswell> jedimind: The NERVE
[12:16:36] <Aristata> how do i join an array of strings with a delimiter?
[12:16:56] <jedimind> that sounds like a job interview question
[12:16:56] <BillCriswell> dogarrhea: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5817526/javascript-is-it-possible-to-view-all-currently-scheduled-timeouts first answer here might help?
[12:17:04] <BillCriswell> dogarrhea: Never to to, to be honest.
[12:17:25] <BillCriswell> Aristata: The answer is in your question.
[12:17:43] <Aristata> .join(" ") fails in ie8
[12:17:43] <c4ptnh00k> afternoon gents
[12:17:52] <BillCriswell> question.split(' ')[3]
[12:18:21] <BillCriswell> Aristata: I doubt that.
[12:18:40] <DeltaHeavy> Aristata: var str; for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; ++i) str += arr[i] + ',';
[12:18:59] <DeltaHeavy> var str = '';    **
[12:19:58] <DeltaHeavy> My gosh this bug in my code is making me go off the wall
[12:20:13] <BillCriswell> ['this','is','a','string'].join(' '); should have no issue in IE8
[12:21:16] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: It's Friday!
[12:21:43] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: Still ;_;
[12:23:34] <dogarrhea> BillCriswell: never to to ?
[12:23:35] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: Afternoon.
[12:23:43] <BillCriswell> never had to*
[12:23:49] <BillCriswell> I meant to fix that lol.
[12:24:23] <boytoy> yo BillCriswell !
[12:24:35] <BillCriswell> yo.
[12:24:49] <c4ptnh00k> Trying hard to actually get work done today...
[12:24:52] <DeltaHeavy> I GUESS JQUERY IS BROKEN UNLESS SOME FINE PERSON(S) CAN DEMONSTRATE THE ERROR OF MY WAYS
[12:24:57] <DeltaHeavy> *hides*
[12:25:14] <c4ptnh00k> DeltaHeavy: Do you have it mocked up in jsfiddle?
[12:25:24] <boytoy> BillCriswell: man that was a nice solution!
[12:25:34] <DeltaHeavy> c4ptnh00k: No but here it is    decorgroupinc.com/store/builders/door-new/
[12:25:35] <boytoy> kudos and a million billion thanks man.. wow..
[12:25:35] <BillCriswell> boytoy: It worked? Sweet.
[12:25:43] <boytoy> :D
[12:25:43] <BillCriswell> I knew it kind of worked, but wasn't 100% on it haha
[12:25:45] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[12:25:53] <DeltaHeavy> c4ptnh00k: Issue is this line in menu.js - $('#menu_' + current + ' .menu-section').animate({ 'height': 0 })
[12:26:11] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: It's just jumping to the bottom now.
[12:26:44] <DeltaHeavy> Instead of animating, it juts goes to zero height immediately. When I run the line (subbing out current for '2'), it works fine and dandy.
[12:27:22] <c4ptnh00k> ...but what am I looking at? a door?
[12:28:49] <boytoy> BillCriswell: well almost works, but the concept is there nonetheless
[12:28:59] <DeltaHeavy> c4ptnh00k: Sorry, to trigger this event select a door style, then click on one of the buttons (no images yet, hover your mouse around to see) then on the .next button.
[12:29:37] <boytoy> BillCriswell: like here i think it oughta stop at "Toodles!" http://jsfiddle.net/7n3GC/3/ but im gonna fiddle around with this tonight and have some fun!
[12:29:52] <BillCriswell> boytoy: Enjoy!
[12:30:12] <DeltaHeavy> c4ptnh00k: Anything unclear?
[12:30:14] <boytoy> :)
[12:30:24] <boytoy> will keep u posted if ur still here
[12:30:28] <boytoy> BILL CRISWELL EVERYBODY!!
[12:30:37] <c4ptnh00k> DeltaHeavy: so I take the end result you want is that after I click next the menu should collapse slowly
[12:30:39] * boytoy drops the mic and leaves.
[12:30:44] <cwatson> He'll be here all night.
[12:31:08] <sopben> Ok, I'm back‚Ä¶got a bit further...
[12:31:13] <c4ptnh00k> Bill you have a boytoy fanboy...
[12:31:22] <cwatson> Ut, oh!
[12:31:24] <DeltaHeavy> Actually, I just fixed this! It was one of the two lines above that .animate() line
[12:31:29] <sopben> I am trying to take a large list, and chunk it up into smaller lists of 3
[12:31:38] <sopben> so, if I have 9 items in my list, I want to make 3 lists of 3
[12:31:44] <c4ptnh00k> DeltaHeavy: glad I could help
[12:32:04] <DeltaHeavy> c4ptnh00k, BillCriswell: Thanks for all your help!
[12:32:26] <c4ptnh00k> I think I got the easy part there
[12:33:04] <sopben> I have a function that counts all the elements, and divides it by the number of items that I would want in my sublists
[12:33:14] <c4ptnh00k> Just going to through this out there. 9/10 times I have a problem, If I just tell my problem to a wall it will give me the answer...
[12:33:22] <c4ptnh00k> thow**
[12:33:23] <sopben> but, what would the function look like that counts through the items and puts them in groups?
[12:33:29] <c4ptnh00k> throw*** AGH
[12:33:50] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: No problem! Wish I could have helped more.
[12:34:04] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: Rubber duck debugging.
[12:34:17] <DeltaHeavy> I'm still really confused as to what caused it. Changed those two lines up there cause those weren't right either and it worked~
[12:34:18] <BillCriswell> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging
[12:34:36] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: Yesir
[12:34:50] <DeltaHeavy> Yus, I know the term. I honestly still don't know what caused this bug so perhaps it isn't quite that but close :p
[12:35:01] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: haha
[12:35:35] <c4ptnh00k> a Ruber Duckie is a little more interesting than my wall
[12:35:47] <c4ptnh00k> rubber* God I can't type today
[12:36:08] <cwatson> BillCriswell: Bill Criswell sounds like a preacher name for some reason.
[12:36:37] <c4ptnh00k> cwatson: That's just racist
[12:36:52] <cwatson> c4ptnh00k: haha!
[12:36:54] <c4ptnh00k> ..:P
[12:37:12] <BillCriswell> cwatson: Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster
[12:37:57] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: Dont let Jedimind hear you saying that. THe force would be displeased
[12:38:09] <cwatson> BillCriswell: Good one. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignosticism FTW
[12:38:42] <BillCriswell> Too much ism.
[12:38:50] <c4ptnh00k> .. i prefer ego-nosticism
[12:38:55] <cwatson> Like atheism.
[12:38:57] <cwatson> lol
[12:39:14] <rbs> How do I HOLD until a $.get is complete? I mean... If I do a $.get request, it takes some time to load data, but the Script does not hold it and continue to execute, I need that it hold until I have all data than I load it...
[12:39:45] <BillCriswell> rbs: You can do async: false, but that's typically an absolutely terrible idea.
[12:39:55] <cwatson> I prefer, I don't know shit and neither do you so we can't prove anything. Everyone is agnostic with atheist leanrings.
[12:39:58] <cwatson> leanings*
[12:40:01] <BillCriswell> might even be deprecated.
[12:40:19] <BillCriswell> I just prefer non-religious.
[12:40:28] <c4ptnh00k> async, false is still good, but I see it as mostly a hack
[12:40:45] <DeltaHeavy> Fun link on this topic - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_nihilism
[12:41:28] <c4ptnh00k> ok so for once I will say it "Bring it back to topic guys"
[12:41:34] <rbs> BillCriswell thanks. I didnt see any mention for async at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/ so I`m not sure how to add it to see how it goes
[12:41:54] <BillCriswell> rbs: Might have to use $.ajax() with method: 'get'
[12:42:03] <rbs> oh!
[12:42:12] <rbs> there we go
[12:42:25] <rbs> thanks BillCriswell
[12:42:29] <BillCriswell> rbs: No problem!
[12:42:35] <c4ptnh00k> ist $.ajax() deprecated?
[12:42:48] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: No. The async: false part of it
[12:42:48] <DeltaHeavy> c4ptnh00k: Nope
[12:42:50] <c4ptnh00k> isn't
[12:43:26] <BillCriswell> It's deprecated with deferred.
[12:43:44] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Solipsism is always a fun topic to bring up  as well. Not in here obviously, btu still fun.
[12:43:58] <Lexi> how do i make jquery select an html5 element like aside?
[12:44:04] <Lexi> $('aside') is not working
[12:44:20] <c4ptnh00k> $(aside)
[12:44:27] <Lexi> oh, i fail
[12:44:28] <Lexi> thank you
[12:44:30] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: Agree'd. Thought about that before but never knew what it was called.
[12:44:30] <BillCriswell> Lexi: That should work.
[12:44:54] <BillCriswell> Lexi: What he said isn't right.
[12:44:59] <Lexi> yeah..that didnt work either
[12:45:04] <c4ptnh00k> im not right
[12:45:13] <c4ptnh00k> i just checked
[12:45:25] <c4ptnh00k> $('aside')
[12:45:34] <BillCriswell> Lexi: http://jsbin.com/aganud/1/edit
[12:45:54] <Lexi> oh.. my function is never even called for some reason, that explains a lot. sorry for wasting your time -_-
[12:46:11] <c4ptnh00k> im just going to stop because this friday I just dont have my mind in the game
[12:47:55] <Lexi> I did settimeout(500, function) instead of settimeout(function 500), lol.
[12:48:37] <BillCriswell> Lexi: Careful with the casing as well.
[12:50:55] <Lexi> I know BillCriswell  I just wrote that in a hurry on irc its not my actual code
[12:51:04] <BillCriswell> Sweet.
[13:00:49] <kavi_> hiii...i have a jquery script that loads a textbox but it is not working..
[13:00:56] <kavi_> am using jquery 1.8.3
[13:01:08] <kavi_>  http://pastebin.com/1BwPU5yK
[13:01:20] <kavi_> this is my jquery..plss help...
[13:04:38] <LaMakina> kavi_: can you be descriptive? what are you expecting vs what's happening
[13:07:46] <ryorky1> is this not a valid call for an $.ajax response?  $('.new_folder').bind('ajax:success',function(event, data, status, xhr){alert(data)});   ?
[13:09:25] <kavi_> <LaMakina>  : As you can see from the pastebin am getting the input from a textbox and retrieve the name using a method and returning the name and populating the name textbox with that value
[13:09:31] <kavi_> am using grails 2.2
[13:09:36] <kavi_> and jquery 1.8.3
[13:09:56] <LaMakina> at what point is it breaking ?
[13:12:02] <aliensky> I have a question
[13:12:11] <aliensky> is it hard to do online calculator with jquery?
[13:12:17] <aliensky> of should I used php?
[13:17:07] <s5fs> aliensky: i'd use javascript over php for an online calculator. there are numerous examples out there as well.
[13:17:32] <aliensky> i need to make numerology calculator
[13:17:44] <aliensky> how hard  is it to do
[13:18:14] <s5fs> i have no idea what numerology is so i cannot estimate effort
[13:18:33] <kavi_> <LaMakina> : in .done portion
[13:18:51] <kavi_> if i put a alert statement also it is not working
[13:18:55] <kavi_> wat am i missing
[13:18:57] <LaMakina> aliensky: it looks like numerology isn't really a calculation problem.
[13:19:55] <aliensky> http://blog.theonlytutorials.com/how-to-create-a-numerology-calculator-in-php/
[13:20:00] <aliensky> here I found one
[13:20:17] <aliensky> I would also need to not only display number but to pull the description of that number
[13:20:34] <aliensky> lets say reno is 19 name so it need to pull uo the description of that name
[13:20:43] <LaMakina> kavi_: are you seeing the request on the server side ?
[13:21:15] <aliensky> how to embed this code on my site?
[13:21:18] <aliensky> it is pho
[13:21:21] <aliensky> i have html site
[13:21:23] <aliensky> page
[13:21:28] <kavi_> yes in my controller it is printing the correct value..for some reason it is not entering the .done portion
[13:21:34] <LaMakina> ok
[13:21:35] <kavi_> is my syntax wrong..
[13:23:20] <s5fs> aliensky: if you have the logic to calculate the output then implementing in javascript should be straightforward. I've done a couple of simple searches on numerology and have found a few paths forward, but without knowing what your more specific goal is, i am kinda stuck
[13:23:50] <s5fs> aliensky: if you are comfortable implementing in php, go for it. you can always port to javascript once you get the calculation working as desired.
[13:24:22] <aliensky> http://www.paulsadowski.com/Numbers.asp this guy has this popular script
[13:24:35] <aliensky> it calculates the name vibration by summin each letter vibration
[13:24:41] <aliensky> then pulling the description from database
[13:25:38] <LaMakina> kavi_: that's not the syntax i personally use but it looks correct to me.
[13:25:47] <LaMakina> are you getting any kind of activity in your network tab \
[13:29:04] <aliensky> s5fs  can I embed that code on html page?
[13:29:12] <aliensky> how to use php code on my page?
[13:30:07] <kavi_> Is success, complete deprecated as of jquery 1.8
[13:30:09] <kavi_> ?
[13:30:49] <s5fs> aliensky: no, the link you provided requires the asp code to handle the form submission.
[13:31:04] <aliensky> so I need database for that s5fs
[13:31:10] <DeltaHeavy> kavi_: I don't know when, but it is deprechated, and I'm pretty sure it was 1.8 or before. The docs will have your answer
[13:31:14] <aliensky> or just use the php extension
[13:31:20] <s5fs> aliensky: you could do the whole thing in javascript, assuming you know what you want to do.
[13:31:37] <aliensky> i dont have a clue nor about pho not about java
[13:32:01] <kavi_> <DeltaHeavy> : am not getting .done to work in jquery 1.8.3
[13:32:05] <s5fs> aliensky: seems to me you can either use numerology and "eat" a birthday, or "eat" a name (as in the last example you provided). but before you can begin, you have to determine what you are trying to accomplish in fairly specific terms.
[13:32:33] <DeltaHeavy> kavi_: Post your code
[13:33:18] <kavi_>  http://pastebin.com/1BwPU5yK
[13:33:41] <aliensky> s5fs  I want people to insert name in the box and press calculate button
[13:33:59] <aliensky> then they would get the description of their name, lets say the vibration is 15, they will get vibration 15....
[13:34:21] <s5fs> aliensky: when they press calculate, the form will process their name, calculate their vibration number, and then fetch the description. correct?
[13:34:26] <aliensky> also will somebody be able to steal the code from my site?
[13:34:30] <LaMakina> kavi_: just tested .done() on 1.8.2 with your syntax and it works  fine here.
[13:34:35] <aliensky> yes s5fs
[13:34:48] <s5fs> aliensky: yeah, they will be able to see your code if you write it in javascript.
[13:35:07] <aliensky> what about pho?
[13:35:11] <aliensky> php?
[13:35:21] <DeltaHeavy> aliensky: If it's written in PHP they can't see your code
[13:35:30] <LaMakina> DeltaHeavy: regarding the deprecation of .done() i think you've got it backwards:
[13:35:42] <aliensky> again s5fs  do I need database to use pho code?
[13:35:49] <aliensky> or just a separate php file?
[13:35:56] <DeltaHeavy> But I suggest you use JS to make an AJAX request, and use PHP to return a result so you don't have to load the page again
[13:36:07] <DeltaHeavy> LaMakina: Naw, pretty sure 'complete:' is deprichated now.
[13:36:08] <s5fs> aliensky: no, you could just have a separate page for each description if you wanted
[13:36:20] <LaMakina> From the jquery doc-> Deprecation Notice: The jqXHR.success(), jqXHR.error(), and jqXHR.complete() callbacks are deprecated as of jQuery 1.8. To prepare your code for their eventual removal, use jqXHR.done(), jqXHR.fail(), and jqXHR.always() instead.
[13:36:40] <aliensky> what you mean separate page?
[13:36:53] <kavi_> <LaMakina> - its not working here
[13:36:56] <kavi_> :(
[13:36:57] <iber> hi there, i've been sitting for like 2 hours now trying to figure out why this doesn't work http://pastebin.com/GDY3TDMV
[13:37:02] <LaMakina> what does your console say kavi_ ?
[13:37:03] <DeltaHeavy> LaMakina: Doesn't that support what I'm saying?
[13:37:11] <JimmyAtCMU> Hi guys, noob here. I'm trying to use a check_box to disable both a textbox and a dropdown input. But somehow it only works for the textbox *not* the dropdown menu. Could someone tell me why?
[13:37:14] <JimmyAtCMU> http://jsfiddle.net/5wzu4/
[13:37:16] <JimmyAtCMU> Thanks!!!!!!
[13:37:37] <DeltaHeavy> kavi_: What's the server responding with? In your dev tools go to the network tab or w/e and find out.
[13:37:40] <iber> position is set to absolute
[13:37:51] <LaMakina> DeltaHeavy:  it says that .done()   SHOULD be used from now on. Whereas you're saying that it's deprecated.  But maybe i misunderstood you
[13:38:15] <iber> the console.log reports correct values
[13:38:17] <DeltaHeavy> LaMakina: I'm saying .complete() and w/e is .
[13:38:20] <iber> but the elements don't move
[13:38:21] <DeltaHeavy> deprichated*
[13:38:27] <kavi_> <DeltaHeavy> -  out put that will be returned is [data:Robert]
[13:38:43] <LaMakina> DeltaHeavy: my bad then.
[13:38:54] <kavi_> <LaMakina> - i ran this through firebug and am not seeting any error
[13:38:58] <kavi_> in the console
[13:39:07] <DeltaHeavy> kavi_: So the server is returning JSON?
[13:39:14] <kavi_> yes
[13:39:33] <DeltaHeavy> kavi_: Run your response through JSON.parse(response); then console.log(response);
[13:39:47] <LaMakina> in your network tab you should be able to see the request being made and the response when it comes back
[13:40:12] <DeltaHeavy> LaMakina: kavi_ did, the server is responding with JSON.
[13:40:52] <kavi_> <DeltaHeavy> - sorry for my ignorance but where should i give json.parse(response) in my .done portion or before ?
[13:41:28] <DeltaHeavy> kavi_: .done() should contain the following code right now
[13:41:45] <DeltaHeavy> data = JSON.parse(data); console.log(data);
[13:42:02] <DeltaHeavy> or $('#firstName').val(data); after or before the console.log() if you want.
[13:42:16] <DeltaHeavy> Take the console.log() out though when you're doing, it's just to check what 'data' is.
[13:44:32] <kavi_> <DeltaHeavy> - it says 404 not found
[13:44:47] <DeltaHeavy> kavi_: Your URL is wrong :p
[13:45:05] <DeltaHeavy> kavi_: url : "getFirstName",
[13:45:12] <DeltaHeavy> Are you sure it's not something like getFirstName.php ?
[13:45:34] <kavi_> am not writing in php..am using grails
[13:46:05] <DeltaHeavy> kavi_: Yeah, I'm just using it as an example. That file you're pointing to doesn't exist though.
[13:46:23] <DeltaHeavy> And what's grails? Do you mean Rails?
[13:46:51] <DeltaHeavy> Ah, Java
[13:46:57] <kavi_> <DeltaHeavy>  - grails is based on groovy..no it is the correct url
[13:47:16] <DeltaHeavy> kavi_: I can assure you it's not the correct URL. The computer isn't lying :p
[13:47:27] <DeltaHeavy> Even if you think it is, it's not.
[13:47:27] <kavi_> because it is going to tat method and i am see it is returning the correct data
[13:47:51] <DeltaHeavy> You JUST said it said 'it says 404 not found'
[13:48:08] <kavi_> yes..
[13:48:39] <DeltaHeavy> Where are you seeing this?
[13:48:59] <kavi_> in my firebug console
[13:49:02] <DeltaHeavy> Cause unless this is the correct data, you must be talking about 2 differnt things.
[13:49:19] <DeltaHeavy> kavi_: What does it return when you put the console.log() at the beginning of the .done() ?
[13:49:57] <kavi_>  <DeltaHeavy>  - console.log() in $.ajax
[13:49:59] <kavi_> ?
[13:50:05] <DeltaHeavy> Yes
[13:52:39] <kavi_> deltaheavy am not able to give  console.log() in ajax
[13:52:42] <kavi_> portion
[13:54:23] <DeltaHeavy> kavi_: You just had it working with something else didn't you?
[13:54:56] <kavi_> i can put tat inside .done
[13:55:08] <kavi_> not in ajax
[13:57:04] <DeltaHeavy> kavi_: That's what I said. I said put it in the beginning of .done()
[13:57:25] <gswain> can i have a directory in the config directory called schools and have individual school config files in that dir?
[13:58:21] <clov3r> hmm, how does http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js handle v2 vs 1.9 ?
[13:59:45] <gswain> I don't see any options for that
[14:00:36] <dcherman> clov3r: it's probably always the 1.x branch.  you shouldn't link to that anyway - link to a specific version
[14:00:53] <gswain> like if i did Config::get('schools.bsu'); its going to look for a schools config file with a var called bsu
[14:01:24] <clov3r> dcherman: i just had this sparkle of hope for a second that the jquery server would determine which version to use automatically
[14:01:27] <gswain> and not a dir schools in the config dir and give me the whole array for bsu.php in the schools dir
[14:01:35] <clov3r> which would save me... like... 3? lines of code
[14:01:50] <clov3r> lazy programmer 'R' me.
[14:01:54] <clov3r> :P
[14:02:01] <dcherman> clov3r: and also potentially break your application every single time a new version is released
[14:02:09] <gswain> zomg I'm in the wrong room
[14:02:17] <gswain> its been a long day
[14:03:25] <niftymonkey> does anyone know where I might find a good working example of using the cometd via jquery?
[14:08:40] <funhouse> what is better to use, $('.class', '#container) or $('#container .class')
[14:09:15] <kavi_> <DeltaHeavy> - am trying a diff approach..will get back soon..
[14:09:51] <DeltaHeavy> kavi_: lol ok. If you can't do something really really basic going about it a different way is just wasting your time.
[14:09:52] <clov3r> funhouse: depends what your goal is
[14:10:18] <kavi_> <DeltaHeavy> - no i found my problem..
[14:10:18] <funhouse> clov3r: speed and performance, class could have up to 250 elements
[14:10:25] <DeltaHeavy> Ok
[14:10:26] <clov3r> the first will select all  '.class' and '#container'
[14:10:46] <clov3r> the second, only the descendants of #container with .class
[14:10:50] <funhouse> clov3r: oh ok, so its not the same thing
[14:10:53] <kavi_> it was actually going to jsp page by default so trying to put tat correctly
[14:11:23] <funhouse> clov3r: I was going by 5. from this article --> http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/10-ways-to-instantly-increase-your-jquery-performance/
[14:12:47] <clov3r> oh
[14:12:55] <clov3r> i have been wrong before
[14:13:17] <clov3r> let me check that api
[14:13:36] <adamsilver> How do I hide all items with class names starting with "AAA-"?
[14:14:12] <DeltaHeavy> adamsilver: What type of element are they?
[14:14:14] <DeltaHeavy> <div>?
[14:14:36] <clov3r> my mistake
[14:14:50] <adamsilver> DeltaHeavy: td
[14:14:55] <clov3r> oh
[14:15:25] <DeltaHeavy> adamsilver: $('td[class^="AAA-"]').hide();
[14:15:59] <adamsilver> DeltaHeavy: thanks
[14:16:09] <DeltaHeavy> np
[14:17:41] <clov3r> actually funhouse: i'm not sure
[14:19:55] <clov3r> .context was deprecated in 1.10
[14:23:44] <kavi_>  <DeltaHeavy> - am using .always and now it is throwing a diff error SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character
[14:23:53] <kavi_> my json data :  data:[Robert]
[14:24:07] <DeltaHeavy> kavi_: That JSON doesn't look right
[14:24:36] <DeltaHeavy> 'data':['Robert'] would be correct if you wanted an array called 'data' that stored the single value of 'Robert' making data[0] = 'Robert'
[14:26:49] <kavi_> <DeltaHeavy> - if the method returns only a text string can i just give datatype :"text" will tat work
[14:27:05] <funhouse> clov3r: ok I will do other way
[14:27:10] <funhouse> clov3r: thank you
[14:27:24] <kavi_> coz i need only one value
[14:27:35] <DeltaHeavy> kavi_: Just return a regular string then
[14:28:20] <Synthead> if I have an array, ['a', 'b', 'c'], is there something in jQuery/JS where I can return ['letter_a', 'letter_b', 'letter_c'] ?
[14:29:17] <clov3r> ooh
[14:29:22] <clov3r> new jquery mobile site
[14:29:28] <clov3r> very nice :)
[14:30:12] <jedimind> what?
[14:30:23] <jedimind> oh i guess it's new-ish
[14:30:26] <jedimind> like 6 months ago now ?
[14:31:45] <clov3r> really?
[14:31:58] <clov3r> maybe i needed a cache refresh or something
[14:32:04] <clov3r> its not been that long
[14:37:32] <Pavlov> is there a good cdn to use that has jquery mobile 1.3.1 that also supports ssl?
[14:39:07] <kavi_> <DeltaHeavy> -  [{"data":"Robert","lastName":"Molera"}] is the json
[14:39:46] <kavi_> still getting SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character
[14:44:04] <shoky> kavi_: if you're doing JSONP then you shouldn't call JSON.parse
[14:44:15] <kavi_> am using json
[14:44:24] <shoky> kavi_: i see dataType:'jsonp' in your paste
[14:44:33] <kavi_> i changed it
[14:44:55] <shoky> kavi_: show your updated code and explain the problem again
[14:45:07] <kavi_> $.parseJSON is valid?
[14:45:19] <shoky> if the JSON is valid, sure.
[14:45:48] <shoky> kavi_: also check your devtools network tab to see the actual response from the server
[14:45:54] <kavi_> <shoky> - <shoky>
[14:46:12] <kavi_> <shoky> http://pastebin.com/NzXbBzR9
[14:46:24] <kavi_> o/p from server : [{"data":"Robert","lastName":"Molera"}]
[14:46:37] <kavi_> am trying to parse out this json..
[14:46:50] <kavi_> and get the [0], [1] value separately
[14:46:53] <kavi_> how to do tat
[14:47:07] <shoky> kavi_:  .always  doesnt get the data as argument
[14:47:09] <shoky> kavi_: use .done
[14:47:52] <shoky> kavi_:  that's what you see in the response in your browser's devtools?
[14:47:59] <kavi_> yes
[14:48:30] <shoky> kavi_:  console.log(typeof data, data)
[14:48:47] <shoky> kavi_: and do that with .done()  not .always()
[14:50:54] <kavi_> <shoky> - for me .done is not working ..it is giving 404 not found error
[14:51:20] <kavi_> i know y..
[14:51:23] <shoky> kavi_:  then its a 404..
[14:51:25] <kavi_> i dont *
[14:51:46] <kavi_> but i can see the output from the controller in the eclipse tat am running
[14:51:53] <shoky> kavi_: what does the network tab say about the request? 404?  using .done or .always should have no effect on the response status...
[14:52:03] <kavi_> so tats not possible..
[14:52:17] <shoky> kavi_: it only matters what the browser sees. and thats in the network tab in firebug
[14:52:40] <kavi_> i am damn sure..it is going to the action and returning the value
[14:52:55] <shoky> kavi_: where are you seeing that
[14:52:58] <kavi_> i dont know why that is saying 404 not found
[14:53:30] <shoky> kavi_: give some screenshots of the request/response in the network tab so i know we're talking about the same thing ...
[14:53:56] <shoky> and show your updated code with .done
[14:57:14] <kavi_>  <shoky> - pastebin cannot paste screenshots
[14:57:31] <shoky> kavi_: http://imgur.com
[14:57:32] <kavi_> can i paste the error am getting in firebug in pastebin
[14:57:47] <shoky> yes, but also screenshots, and the updated code
[14:59:31] <kavi_> http://imgur.com/gallery/uPm0ckR/new
[15:00:26] <shoky> kavi_: looks like a server-side issue..
[15:00:41] <shoky> that's not JSON :P
[15:00:58] <shoky> is that URL correct..
[15:01:12] <kavi_> <shoky> - do u know grails
[15:01:16] <shoky> kavi_: no
[15:01:25] <kavi_> its an action in a controller..
[15:01:36] <kavi_> i have given under url..
[15:01:54] <shoky> kavi_: if you browse to that URL what do you see
[15:02:22] <kavi_> tat url doesnt exist..it should not go there..it is a action method
[15:02:25] <kavi_> in controller
[15:02:29] <shoky> what..
[15:02:37] <shoky> you can't ajax to a url that doesnt exist..?
[15:03:29] <kavi_> shoky - i have done tat in jquery 1.6 in one of other project..it should go a action method (url in jquery) and retrun a json and populate an element in gsp
[15:03:53] <shoky> kavi_: i dont care what you did before. you can't ajax to a url that doesn't exist
[15:03:55] <kavi_> basically, the url specified is a method name in the controller tat do exists
[15:03:56] <shoky> as you can see.
[15:04:23] <shoky> fix the URL to a URL that does exist :\
[15:04:29] <kavi_> url is going to a method..in the controller tat exists
[15:05:09] <shoky> fix the URL.
[15:11:57] <jonkristian> Any idea how the logic with background image and current movie is solved here? http://movies.io/
[15:12:29] <jonkristian> I am doing something similar with a bandsearch thing. Also any suggestions on approaches would be welcome.
[15:13:20] <shoky> jonkristian: what logic? what's the problem?
[15:14:07] <jonkristian> shoky, you see the background reflects whichever movie is chosen
[15:14:38] <jonkristian> just wondering what would be the best approach, like using body classes or something
[15:15:05] <shoky> wat
[15:15:16] <shoky> best approach for what problem..
[15:16:01] <jonkristian> shoky, dynamic backgrounds.
[15:16:13] <shoky> what's dynamic about it?
[15:16:32] <jonkristian> shoky, press the refresher at the bottom or go to a different page
[15:17:01] <shoky> a new page opens up that has a different background image..
[15:17:24] <jonkristian> yeah that's one way to do it i guess
[15:17:26] <shoky> the approach is... to have multiple images. and.. use the one you want to
[15:17:33] <jonkristian> that's not the case with movies.io thought.
[15:17:43] <shoky> you can do it without loading a new page too.. just change the background-image css
[15:19:07] <jonkristian> shoky, yeah I know. Was just thinking what the best approach would be. To use a body class with an id that reflects the movie, or if there are any plugin solutions that would do the job better.
[15:19:22] <shoky> body class with an id?
[15:19:24] <shoky> heh.
[15:19:49] <jonkristian> sorry, had a few beers, body class with the id of the cover
[15:19:53] <jonkristian> cover being the background...
[15:20:38] <shoky> this is what they have:  <style>body{background-image:url('http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/n6i283o1BGgAyzG7BAJttB6uX7p.jpg');}</style>
[15:21:13] <shoky> that's the "dynamic" part of the css, anyway
[15:21:31] <jonkristian> yeah, then they have the movie details in the footer
[15:21:49] <jonkristian> that's server-side
[15:22:12] <shoky> the background image url is probably generated server-side too
[15:22:17] <jonkristian> right
[15:22:29] <shoky> that's the approach ;]
[15:22:32] <shoky> ?cc

[15:41:08] <kavi> shoky - i fixed that error..and getting [{"data":"Robert","lastName":"Molera"}] under response in console
[15:41:58] <kavi> could you pls help me to parse this data..i tried var obj = jQuery.parseJSON(data); alert(obj.data);
[15:42:11] <kavi> but returning null
[15:45:47] <shoky> kavi:  show your updated code
[15:46:41] <kavi> <shoky>  - i had to change in the controller from return to render
[15:46:49] <kavi> jquery was fine
[15:47:27] <shoky> kavi:  put dataType: 'json'   and remove the parseJSON call. then console.log(typeof data, data)  in the .done callback
[15:49:07] <kavi> shoky : object [Object { data="Robert", lastName="Molera"}]
[15:49:19] <kavi> with response as earlier, json tab
[15:49:34] <kavi> has the json data
[15:51:09] <shoky> kavi: that's good.  now data is your array.  you can do console.log(data[0].data, data[0].lastName)  for example
[15:54:29] <kavi> <shoky> - thnk u..
[15:54:37] <kavi> u made my day successful :)
[15:54:41] <kavi> have a good weekend
[15:54:43] <shoky> np ;]
[15:57:03] <joker_89> hi, i add dinamically a <button class="myclass" and this button dont works when i press and execute the myclass onclick
[15:57:11] <joker_89> how can i solve this?
[15:57:58] <shoky> joker_89: event delegation. read about it here: see ?on
[15:57:59] <bot-t1> joker_89, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[15:58:37] <shoky> joker_89:  something like:  $('#container').on('click', '.myclass', function() { ... })
[16:00:09] <joker_89> ok
[16:02:30] <joker_89> i dont undesrtand why i need the on()
[16:02:35] <joker_89> and why now didnt work
[16:03:06] <shoky> because doing  $('.myclass').click(...)  will only set it on elements that exist at that time
[16:03:30] <shoky> same for $('.myclass').on('click', function(){..})
[16:07:38] <goldstar> once I have serialized a form $(form).serialize() -- if I want to get the value for a given var in that string, how can I do this ?
[16:08:24] <shoky> goldstar: you can use .serializeArray() instead to get an array
[16:08:58] <goldstar> shoky: oh yes, serializeArray! thanks!
[16:09:01] <shoky> or.. just $(form).find('[name=myinput]').val()
[16:09:15] <goldstar> thanks shoky
[16:09:19] <shoky> input[name=myinput]  that is
[16:28:04] <joker_89> so on() is the same?
[16:32:29] <shoky> joker_89: there is more than one way to use .on() and they are not the same
[16:36:11] <grid_> hey
[16:36:39] <joker_89> shama
[16:36:49] <joker_89> shoky i am trying and didnt work
[16:36:54] <joker_89> who i need to use it?
[16:37:20] <shoky> `demo @ joker_89
[16:37:20] <b-ot> joker_89: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:45:32] <joker_89> i add dinamically some like this: $(".unfoldown2").on("click", function(event){ }); and then add a <button class="unfoldown" ..
[16:45:38] <joker_89> and didnt get
[16:47:15] <shoky> joker_89: told ya, you need to use event delegation:  $('#container').on('click', '.myclass', function() { ... })
[16:47:32] <joker_89> so its not the same!
[16:47:42] <shoky> that's what i said..
[16:47:42] <shoky> <shoky> joker_89: there is more than one way to use .on() and they are not the same
[16:47:47] <shoky> NOT the same.
[16:47:52] <joker_89> i dont use any container
[16:48:05] <shoky> $('body') or $(document)  works too
[16:48:31] <joker_89> ok
[16:49:49] <joker_89> $('document').on("click", '.unfoldown2', function(){ ... and <button class="unfoldown" and alose didnt go
[16:49:54] <shoky> not $('document')
[16:50:07] <shoky> there's no <document> element
[16:50:08] <joker_89> ok
[16:50:55] <shoky> also..  .unfoldown2 won't work for class="unfoldown"
[16:51:20] <joker_89> now works but
[16:51:50] <joker_89> i have a lot code with $(document).ready(funcition() $(".myclass").click(function()....
[16:52:00] <joker_89> i dont want to repeat all the code
[16:53:11] <shoky> nobody said you need to repeat anything
[16:53:43] <joker_89> so i need to use always on?
[16:53:58] <shoky> you can
[17:12:17] <afahim_> mobile web performance wise, is jquery mobile faster than jquery?
[17:22:41] <LordThumper> Hi, any way to select the element?
[17:22:42] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/8K9ha/
[17:22:59] <LordThumper> I have tried encoding the slash, but the jquery selector is not accepting html entities
[17:24:31] <LordThumper> I think / is allowed in html attributes, however I cannot seem to be able to select the element :/
[17:26:51] <tw2113> i'd wager it invalidates the class attribute
[17:27:48] <thesisb> DOM Exception 12
[17:30:22] <LordThumper> http://jsfiddle.net/8K9ha/1/
[17:30:26] <LordThumper> That doesn't worth either
[17:30:32] <LordThumper> I have no idea how to store the / char
[17:30:37] <LordThumper> and select using it
[17:31:13] <shoky> LordThumper: $(".item-n\\/a");
[17:31:56] <LordThumper> Perfect, thanks alot :-)
[17:32:03] <tw2113> hmm, learned something new
[17:32:11] <tw2113> class attributes can have /'s
[17:32:27] <LordThumper> Yeah just read some documentation that said its allowed, that's why I was confused
[17:32:36] <shoky> LordThumper: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[17:32:45] <shoky> read 2nd sentence
[17:32:49] <LordThumper> Ah right
[17:35:14] <tw2113> wait what...you people can read??? I'm jealous
[17:36:02] <shoky> i can't. i just listen with my eyes
[17:36:36] <LordThumper> That sounds hard, I can barely smell with my ears
[17:36:48] <shoky> got a migraine in my groin
[17:37:21] <LordThumper> a nosebleed in my feet
[17:40:52] <prometh> hi
[17:41:12] <LordThumper> eus
[17:41:23] <prometh> if i do $(element).append("<div id='something'></div>"); how can i get that appended div without knowing its id?
[17:42:10] <shoky> var div = $("<div id='something'></div>");  $(element).append(div);
[17:42:16] <LordThumper> or
[17:42:39] <LordThumper> $("<div id='blah' />").appendTo($(element))
[17:42:58] <LordThumper> And it returns the div DOM object
[17:43:00] <prometh> the probelm is that i'm not really dealing with an html string.. it's actually a fragment
[17:43:35] <shoky> then why ask about an html string :\
[17:43:49] <prometh> to simplify.. sorry
[17:44:10] <prometh> $(container).append(fragment);
[17:44:26] <prometh> how can i get that appended fragment within $(container) ?
[17:45:09] <LordThumper> What's a fragment?
[17:45:46] <prometh> DocumentFragment
[17:46:00] <prometh> its like a dom element, only it's not added to the dom
[17:46:03] <prometh> or rather, not yet part of the dom
[17:46:26] <prometh> jquery uses them internally and so does CanJS... the framework i'm using
[17:46:32] <LordThumper> oh so $(container) is not part of the DOM yet?
[17:46:39] <prometh> container is
[17:46:40] <prometh> fragment is not
[17:46:53] <prometh> once it's appended, it is
[17:47:16] <prometh> i've tried doing something=$(container).append(fragment); // but it gives me the container
[17:47:20] <shoky> the fragment wasn't appended, its contents were
[17:47:27] <prometh> right
[17:47:43] <prometh> so, hm..
[17:47:52] <shoky> var contents = $(fragment).contents();   do that before you append it
[17:47:56] <LordThumper> Did you try appendTo ?
[17:47:56] <shoky> i think that should work
[17:48:42] <LordThumper> $("<div />").appendTo("body") returns the fragment (?) <div></div>
[17:49:05] <prometh> if you didn't add it to the body, it'd be a fragment
[17:49:24] <LordThumper> Oh so $("<div />") is the fragment. ok
[17:49:26] <shoky> not really
[17:49:34] <shoky> that's just a DOMElement
[17:51:13] <prometh> yeah, i'm not entirely sure where jquery uses fragments
[17:51:21] <prometh> i'm new to them... within the passed few days
[17:51:32] <shoky> it uses them for more complex html strings i think
[17:51:35] <shoky> not for single elements
[17:52:05] <lampe2> hey i have a problem with jquery ui tabs: http://imagebin.org/260619 and i dont know why safari is doing this :/
[17:52:32] <lampe2> the elements are tab elements
[17:53:28] <prometh> $(fragment) works, but i get text elements within it
[17:53:52] <shoky> prometh: because the fragment contains them. use .children() instead of .contents() if you dont want them
[17:54:19] <prometh> fucking awesome
[17:54:21] <prometh> thanks man
[17:54:27] <prometh> shoky++
[17:54:28] <shoky> yw
[17:55:30] <shoky> lampe2:  can you make the photo blurrier please?
[17:55:36] <shoky> too sharp :\
[17:56:58] <prometh> hmm.. once i append the $(fragment), i can't access the chidlren anymore
[17:57:32] <lampe2> shoky: you can clearly see what the error is. the middle element breaks out of the div on the ipad ;/ but on the desktop it works on everybrowser
[17:57:47] <prometh> jfrag=$(fragment);   $(container).append(jfrag);   console.log( jfrag.children() );
[17:58:11] <shoky> prometh: tola ya, do it BEFORE appending
[17:58:15] <shoky> told*
[17:58:23] <prometh> hmm
[17:58:24] <prometh> ok
[17:59:08] <prometh> coooool
[17:59:10] <prometh> :)
[17:59:15] <shoky> lampe2: i can clearly see nothing there
[17:59:37] <lampe2> i take a nother picture...
[18:00:05] <shoky> dont know shit about safari/ios anyways
[18:00:21] <LordThumper> apple master race
[18:00:32] <shoky> heh
[18:01:07] <prometh> shoky: how do i get the first element from a list?
[18:01:14] <prometh> get(0) ?
[18:01:26] <prometh> or [0]
[18:01:33] <prometh> or does that give the domelement
[18:01:40] <shoky> yeah
[18:01:45] <shoky> eq(0) for the jq object
[18:01:51] <prometh> cool, thanks again
[18:01:52] <shoky> or .first()
[18:01:56] <LordThumper> :first ftw
[18:02:09] <prometh> i tried first() .. didn't seem to do antyhing
[18:02:21] <shoky> weird..
[18:02:52] <prometh> or maybe i'm not just not used to chrome
[18:02:58] <prometh> its console is different from mac safari
[18:03:03] <shoky> what did it return
[18:03:30] <prometh> an array-looking object
[18:03:33] <prometh> context:fragment etc
[18:03:43] <prometh> length: 1
[18:03:50] <prometh> ah, jquery object
[18:03:53] <shoky> a jquery object is an array-looking object ;p
[18:03:55] <prometh> i think i'm tired :)
[18:03:57] <prometh> yeah , hehe
[19:04:24] <hugo_moss> is there a way to detect connection speed?

[21:14:20] <shoky> hmpf
[21:23:24] <neilk_> I'm working with a codebase written by someone else. Does $( function() { ...random stuff... } ) do anything useful?
[21:23:48] <tw2113> depends on what's in the random stuff section
[21:24:25] <neilk_> tw2113: he sets up some .keyup events
[21:24:30] <neilk_> I can paste if you like
[21:24:41] <tw2113> it'd help everyone help you
[21:24:43] <tw2113> so go for it
[21:24:47] <tw2113> pastebin.com
[21:26:10] <neilk_> http://pastebin.mozilla.org/2497421
[21:26:29] <neilk_> I think he might have thought it did something with scoping
[21:28:12] <neilk_> it doesn't seem that it would do anything different from, say, an IIFE
[21:29:19] <neilk_> it's not some short way of doing a $.ready?
[21:29:22] <shoky> neilk_: it is
[21:29:30] <neilk_> ah, nm then
[21:29:33] <tw2113> i see nothing fishy
[21:29:36] <neilk_> shoky: thanks
[21:29:42] <tw2113> other than not knowing where get_videos is defined
[21:32:48] <shoky> $(body) is a bit fishy too
[21:36:49] <tw2113> no selling peoples' bodies for objects
[21:37:23] <tw2113> it's rude!
[21:39:03] <shoky> i concur
[22:08:38] <b1lly> watsup
[22:11:45] * tw2113 gives b1lly alcohol
[22:17:29] <funhouse> ok so what is faster, $('.class') or $('.class', '#container')
[22:18:25] <tw2113> i'm guessing the latter because you're specifying a context with an ID
[22:24:57] <funhouse> tw2113: ok
[22:36:20] <b1lly> funhouse, $('#container .class') is fastest
[23:07:55] <funhouse> ah b11ly left, thanks man
