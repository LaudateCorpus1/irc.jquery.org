[11:30:26] <bassfly> Hello!
[11:31:06] <bassfly> I'm a bit desperate trying to write a simples code. Anyone happy to help?
[11:35:19] <bassfly> =$
[11:37:56] <Robdgreat> insufficient information
[11:42:00] <bassfly> https://jsfiddle.net/e9hucqrf/
[11:42:15] <bassfly> that's the piece of code i need help with
[11:43:33] <bassfly> I'd wrap all tittles (Desription, Directions, Safety Information, Indications, Ingredients...) in h3 tags
[11:43:53] <bassfly> I only get to make it work with the first title
[11:43:57] <bassfly> please help
[11:54:12] <Robdgreat> it only works with the first because that's the only one that matches Description:
[11:55:38] <bassfly> I tried duplicating that code and changing the word to Directions, and the only Directions would work and not Description
[11:56:11] <Robdgreat> you say that as if you expected something else
[11:56:53] <bassfly> could you help me Robdgreat ?
[11:59:24] <Robdgreat> bassfly: this is not a jquery problem
[11:59:59] <Robdgreat> your issue lies entirely within the text.replace call, which is plain old javascript
[12:00:47] <bassfly> should I ask in a different channel then?
[12:01:38] <Robdgreat> ##javascript seems the best choice
[12:02:05] <bassfly> thank you Robdgreat
[12:02:11] <Robdgreat> good luck
