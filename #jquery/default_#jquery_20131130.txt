[00:50:19] <javalover> and after 50 groosom hours of banging my head against a wall, the calender works!!
[00:50:41] <joroci> what kind of calendar?
[00:50:46] <javalover> just the normal one
[00:50:49] <javalover> i was exaggerating but
[00:50:56] <javalover> man that was annoying, constant errors
[00:51:24] <joroci> i'm working on an appointment schedule system
[00:51:26] <javalover> it's very nice though
[00:51:35] <javalover> oh yeah?
[00:51:38] <joroci> yea
[00:51:49] <joroci> using angular and node js
[00:51:50] <javalover> are you running into similar issues?
[00:52:08] <joroci> i'm running into tons of issues since i'm not familiar with both them ):)
[00:52:15] <javalover> ic
[00:52:18] <javalover> how can I help?
[00:52:31] <joroci> how are you with mysql?
[00:52:39] <javalover> well i'm good
[00:52:46] <javalover> i'm not like an expert, but i use it...
[00:52:54] <joroci> yea me too
[00:53:00] <joroci> <joroci> http://www.sqlfiddle.com/#!2/4fe0f/1
[00:53:00] <joroci> <joroci> i'm not sure if the table layout is the proper way to do it
[00:53:00] <joroci> <joroci> i want a list of all technicians with their appointments but instead of client_id job_type_id status_id i want the values
[00:53:00] <joroci> <joroci> based on the startdate i provide as variable
[00:53:22] <joroci> i want to do it with one query if possible
[00:53:27] <javalover> that's aweomse I should use sql fiddle more often
[00:53:37] <joroci> yea i found out about it yesterday
[00:53:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> joroci: whats cracking
[00:53:52] <joroci> kinda annoying you can't import data
[00:54:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> got a question for you
[00:54:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> i have a radio button
[00:54:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> there is a label element right beside it
[00:54:36] <javalover> wait hold on
[00:54:58] <joroci> who?
[00:55:02] <javalover> you
[00:55:07] <joroci> holding
[00:55:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> how can i target the radio button and then use the .next() equivilent in css
[00:55:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> to target the label
[00:55:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> im trying to create custom radio buttons
[00:55:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> joroci: ^
[00:55:36] <javalover> what values?
[00:56:08] <joroci> you mean status job_type?
[00:56:12] <joroci> and rohan
[00:56:27] <javalover> i guess I have to look at ur table but
[00:56:29] <joroci> what browsers?
[00:56:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> needs to work for all
[00:56:41] <javalover> so instead of the id what do you want?
[00:56:45] <javalover> oh you want job type
[00:56:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> i have donea solution that works for all browsers and ie11
[00:56:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> but i need something more cross brwoser
[00:56:53] <javalover> well yeah just ask for it in the query then
[00:56:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> joroci: ^
[00:57:06] <joroci> yea you need jquery or javascript
[00:57:19] <joroci> jquery if you want more crossbrowser support
[00:57:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/css3-checkbox-radio/
[00:57:31] <javalover> Rohan it's likeI always say
[00:57:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> joroci: ^
[00:57:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> its done here
[00:57:41] <joroci> yea
[00:57:41] <javalover> some people don't even have phones yet
[00:57:45] <joroci> but ie6 7 8
[00:57:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> but i want to beable to target label via radio button
[00:57:50] <javalover> doesn't mean making an iphone app won't get you rich
[00:58:19] <joroci> rohan you can't use css for all versions of ie6
[00:58:20] <joroci> ie*
[00:58:30] <javalover> yeah...and why even bother with ie6
[00:58:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> so is there a way by which bro
[00:58:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> im not targeting that far back
[00:58:47] <joroci> jquery
[00:58:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> anything ie9+ is fine
[00:58:57] <javalover> why not just type "ur on ie6, cmon man go get chrome/firefox, ur work won't let you sorry to hear that i'm still rich DOLLA DOLLA BILLS YOOOOOOOOOOOO"
[00:59:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> javalover: lol
[00:59:21] <javalover> i'm serious though
[00:59:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> but ya
[00:59:30] <javalover> when it comes to cross platform, like there's only so much you can do
[00:59:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/css3-checkbox-radio/
[00:59:36] <javalover> freaking ie6 are you seriuos, no just skip it
[00:59:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> in that he targets lables directly
[00:59:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> which is fine
[00:59:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> but if i use labels for soemthing else
[01:00:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> so in css is there something equivilent of .next() like there is in jquery
[01:00:22] <javalover> that's like making a record in 2014 & going "I hope the people from the 60's like this"
[01:00:24] <joroci> i would skip all ie.. :)
[01:00:34] <joroci> ok ok 10+
[01:00:41] <javalover> in fact
[01:00:47] <javalover> you're helping by not making it compatible with ie6
[01:00:55] <javalover> so all the ie6 users can go "i can't use your product damnit"
[01:00:58] <javalover> and eventually upgrade
[01:01:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> actually joroci read this http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465739.aspx
[01:01:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> ie 11 has some nifty stuff
[01:01:35] <javalover> ie is the worst browser
[01:01:40] <javalover> aside from netscape
[01:01:44] <joroci> so java you have an idea what can i do?
[01:01:49] <javalover> yes I do
[01:01:52] <javalover> it sounds very simple
[01:02:09] <joroci> talk to me :)
[01:02:10] <javalover> ur asking for a different collumn right?
[01:02:19] <javalover> see it's simple if you made ur database correct
[01:02:28] <javalover> i have yet to look over ur actual code, first I want to know the problem
[01:02:31] <joroci> yea i'm not sure if it is correct
[01:02:39] <joroci> you can see the tables
[01:02:44] <javalover> yeah lemme run it
[01:02:59] <joroci> Rohan_Bhangui
[01:03:05] <joroci> you can use the sibling selector
[01:03:11] <joroci> it's ie8 +
[01:03:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> i could aslo use
[01:03:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> ~
[01:03:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> tilde
[01:03:26] <joroci> that's what i'm saying :)
[01:03:42] <joroci> it's ie8+
[01:03:43] <javalover> idk this sqlfiddle i can't see the tables but
[01:03:47] <javalover> if you just explain it i'm sure I have an answer
[01:04:00] <joroci> ok so
[01:04:12] <joroci> i have the technicians, appointments, clients tables
[01:04:26] <joroci> i have another table that's linking between the technicians and appointments
[01:04:36] <javalover> indexed?
[01:04:38] <joroci> yea
[01:04:41] <javalover> k
[01:04:44] <javalover> makes sense so far
[01:04:55] <joroci> everything is primary key and foreign key
[01:05:01] <javalover> as it should be
[01:05:03] <joroci> so appointment.job_type_id
[01:05:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> joroci: what is differnce between '~' and '+'
[01:05:31] <javalover> well if you have a bunch of +++ then you can make pacman, but ~~~ is used for making snake :-)
[01:06:06] <joroci> + means that the style applies only to element directly following another element.
[01:06:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay i guess then i need +
[01:07:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> ~ is more any element after it?
[01:07:08] <javalover> right so joroci continue what you were saying
[01:07:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> this stuff is css3 spec? or existing
[01:07:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> existing = css2/css1
[01:07:59] <joroci> ~ is ie8+
[01:08:05] <joroci> ~ will apply to all siblings
[01:08:22] <javalover> imma get some food, joroci please finish what you were saying so I can scroll up & solve ur issue
[01:08:22] <joroci> so anyway java
[01:08:57] <joroci> i want a a list of technicians and their appointments with values of the other tables not the ids
[01:09:09] <joroci> basically all the data, so i can return it as json
[01:12:09] <javalover> yeah so join them
[01:12:31] <joroci> i did
[01:12:38] <javalover> and?
[01:12:40] <javalover> what was result?
[01:13:11] <joroci> you can see what i did, but it's not working in the fiddle
[01:13:26] <javalover> well theres only 1 issue with joinning
[01:13:35] <javalover> and that's you have to put like select mything as mything1
[01:13:41] <javalover> you have to make each one unique
[01:14:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> joroci: working like a charm thanks, you too javalover
[01:14:25] <javalover> otherwise collumns can overlap
[01:14:32] <joroci> what is working
[01:14:32] <joroci> ?
[01:14:48] <joroci> it is unique no?
[01:15:01] <javalover> well atleast now I can check 1 sec
[01:15:15] <javalover> and ur welcome Rohan, but I was just comedy relief lol
[01:15:42] <javalover> SELECT a.*
[01:15:47] <javalover> yeah that's not exactly how I would do it
[01:16:27] <javalover> not saying it can't be done that way but
[01:16:52] <javalover> here i have one for you
[01:18:30] <javalover> 'SELECT * FROM `appointments` a, `employees` e WHERE e.id = 123 AND a.accountid = e.accountid LIMIT 0, 30 '
[01:18:36] <javalover> i only changed this slightly
[01:18:45] <javalover> but that's an example of a join
[01:18:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> joroci: the radio buttons are working
[01:18:51] <javalover> this one works
[01:19:03] <javalover> i think ur select might be wrong
[01:19:13] <javalover> try this
[01:19:37] <javalover> Select name, otherstuff FROM table1 as A,table 2 as B
[01:19:48] <joroci> wait
[01:19:50] <joroci> i got an idea
[01:19:57] <javalover> i think when you try to select like a.table  that's the issue
[01:21:39] <joroci> java it works but i want it for all technicians
[01:46:48] <aro> is there a way to detect if a form is submitted using a specific button?
[01:47:15] <joroci> yea
[01:47:19] <aro> how?
[01:47:26] <joroci> catch the event for submit
[01:47:42] <joroci> and check for the target id
[01:47:44] <aro> we have a submit handler on a form, and we want to intercept the behavior of that if this cancel button is clicked
[01:48:05] <joroci> cancel isn't submiting
[01:48:11] <aro> yes it is
[01:48:35] <joroci> what cancel is doing?
[01:49:49] <aro> it submits the form, but the receiving code checks for the post value of the cancel button
[01:50:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> joroci: any way to turn font weight only on for chrome
[01:51:28] <joroci> add a class to the html or body tag if it's chrome
[01:51:38] <joroci> and do .chrome element { font-weight:
[01:52:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> i got it
[01:52:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> -webkit-text-stroke
[01:52:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> joroci: http://css-tricks.com/beefing-up-dull-text-in-webkit/
[01:52:38] <joroci> i think it will work for safari too
[01:53:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> good
[02:06:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> time to add my own glyphs to font awesome

[03:50:32] <sharpy35> hi
[03:52:10] <sharpy35> i have a quesitoin i am using this code http://paste.schredder.pw/1870/ to perform 2 ajax requests. using jquery and the jquery form plugin. the thing is, that the 2nd request gets called in the success callback of the first requestr but i am getting a redirect to the main site of my module (using zend framework 2) can u help me figure this out?
[03:53:12] <sharpy35> the first request works fine! and i am getting a JSON as a respond
[05:11:05] <kpl> Testing https://github.com/wizzud/uithemeswitch, using 2.0.3/1.10.3, and get the following Error: no such method 'activate' for accordion widget instance. The possibly deprecated method is used to close the accordion: .accordion('activate', false); What could I replace that method with?
[05:59:29] <intellilogic> I'm getting a syntax error:  $('a:regex(class,expression_1), :regex(class,expression_1) a');  (I stipped known working expressions for simplication).  Seperate they work fine, when I add them to a single selector they fail.  I'm using this regex selector:  http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/regex-selector-for-jquery/
[05:59:59] <SuperTyp> hello guys isn't it possible to set the duration of the slide effect of jqueryUI.toggle("slide");  ? :(
[06:01:16] <intellilogic> http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/
[06:06:35] <SuperTyp> intellilogic: is complete optional?
[06:17:08] <intellilogic> I want to match red, redgreen, but not redblue.  So I turn to regex  ('a:regex(class,red(?:(?!blue))+)); works great.  Then I want to apply multiple and it fails $('a:regex(class,red(?:(?!blue))+), :regex(class,red(?:(?!blue))+) a');  I imagine this is because the expression contains ':', how to resolve this?  Some sort of escaping?
[06:20:38] <thanksthroat> how do I fade in an image on load?
[06:20:47] <thanksthroat> but I don't want all the divs below it to move
[06:28:23] <SuperTyp> yellowfish: you could add another hidden div at the place of the image
[06:28:38] <yellowfish> isn't that bad practice?
[06:28:44] <SuperTyp> dunno
[06:30:12] <usc911> Hey guys, just wondering if someone could help? I have 3 selectable divs, 2 wrong one right, if I then click submit im just trying to alert if it was right or wrong. but it just always returns right. https://gist.github.com/bmweeden/b1b44bbb2202f9cf9d9a anyone have an idea? Many thanks
[06:34:20] <bgy> Hi
[06:35:18] <Ittabraga> yellowfish: what about an image-wrapper div
[06:37:11] <SuperTyp> usc911: jsfiddle would be awesome
[06:38:06] <usc911> ok ok sorry
[06:38:08] <usc911> 2 secs
[06:38:43] <SuperTyp> usc911: you use the id selector "wrong" twice, I dunno right but isnt that illegal?
[06:43:13] <usc911> hmm
[06:43:14] <usc911> http://jsfiddle.net/HjZTe/
[06:43:21] <usc911> so this is what I have currently
[06:47:33] <sacho_> usc911, what does the function $() return? When is $('#right') falsy?
[06:47:37] <cannap> <span class="q_right">Correct</div>
[06:48:42] <SuperTyp> the if makes no sense to me
[06:51:12] <SuperTyp> you check if($('#right')) but there is no #right set
[06:51:27] <usc911> hi sorry http://jsfiddle.net/HjZTe/2/ that was the correct version
[06:51:58] <SuperTyp> okay
[06:52:35] <usc911> sorry, just confusing myself a bit
[06:52:59] <SuperTyp> (dont u forget to add the jquery ;) in jsfiddle on the right navigation bar)
[06:53:21] <cannap> woa i like theseus :D
[06:55:36] <usc911> SuperTyp: http://jsfiddle.net/HjZTe/3/
[06:55:42] <usc911> apologies
[06:56:08] <SuperTyp> theseus?
[06:57:02] <usc911> ?
[06:57:26] <SuperTyp> that was meant to cannap
[06:57:46] <usc911> np
[06:58:19] <cannap> SuperTyp http://d.pr/i/pffP
[06:58:29] <SuperTyp> usc911: it seems to me your if is not right
[06:58:33] <SuperTyp> the condition is wrong
[06:58:59] <SuperTyp> cannap: I dont get it^^
[07:00:25] <SuperTyp> usc911: you could make it like this: if you click on one of the 3 divs, you add a class "clicked"
[07:00:58] <cannap> or use checkboxes
[07:01:14] <cannap> but i dont know what you want XD
[07:01:28] <usc911> SuperTyp: ah, good plan
[07:01:33] <usc911> cannap: cheers
[07:01:35] <SuperTyp> usc911: then you make this if like this: if("clicked"class.hasClass("clicked") && clickedClass.hasClass("right")){ alert true;} else{alert false};
[07:01:44] <SuperTyp> (its pseudocode)
[07:02:16] <SuperTyp> usc911: for this you have to add ids to identify proper which div has been clicked on
[07:03:18] <usc911> cool, I dodnt really think this would be too much hassle to be honest, I just have three buttons, ig you selct one and click submit I just wanted it to return right or wrong based on the class
[07:03:49] <sacho_> usc911, it's not a hassle.
[07:04:05] <sacho_> your condition is still wrong, because you still don't know what $() returns
[07:04:36] <SuperTyp> usc911: I think its necessary (correct me if I am wrong)
[07:04:59] <usc911> hmm ok, guess I will have a play with it
[07:05:10] <SuperTyp> usc911: but you can use event.target()
[07:05:20] <SuperTyp> to identify which div has been clicked
[07:05:29] <SuperTyp> (correct me if I am wrong :D)
[07:07:32] <cannap> check what is clicked then set var status = true or false
[07:08:03] <cannap> and then check if(status) {true} else {false}
[07:08:31] <SuperTyp> event.target.id or event.target.className
[07:08:50] <sacho_> usc911, there are no buttons in your code sample, though
[07:08:57] <SuperTyp> usc911: http://api.jquery.com/event.target/
[07:09:07] <SuperTyp> usc911: if you need any help just tell us
[07:09:18] <SuperTyp> do not think this is too complicated, because its not
[07:09:44] <SuperTyp> going to play some football, but someone else will surely help you :)
[07:09:48] <usc911> SuperTyp: thanks, I know its not complicated, im just brain fried!
[07:09:53] <usc911> cheers :)
[07:10:01] <SuperTyp> cya later
[07:10:04] <SuperTyp> good luck

[07:19:12] <jParkton> I am using .hide() on a picture but if I put an a element it jumps the page to the top again how do I do .hide() and .show() on a div and not have the page jump? Just remove the a link?
[07:19:55] <cannap> show
[07:20:07] <cannap> but u can simply set display:none
[07:20:23] <cannap> ah omg xD hide makes the same .P
[07:21:58] <jParkton> lol
[07:22:18] <cannap>  the page will jump when u set .hide to this u can make <div><hiden emlement></hiden elemend></div> and then the div will stay
[07:22:23] <cannap> when u give a height
[07:22:28] <usc911> cannap: fixed it, https://gist.github.com/bmweeden/19de53b17fc8c3102b3a cheers :)
[07:22:33] <jParkton> oh
[07:25:52] <j0llyr0tten> i'm building this rails app. i install an ajax handler using link_to but it doesn't fire
[07:25:55] <jParkton> nah didnt work
[07:26:25] <j0llyr0tten> i think it's because the link resides in a nested list structure, each layer of which responds to a click event
[07:27:12] <j0llyr0tten> but i then issue an event.stopPropogation and that seems to stop the ajax handler from being called
[07:27:37] <j0llyr0tten> i've been wracking my brains but i can't figure out how to implement this :/
[07:28:05] <cannap> jParkton make a example
[07:29:35] <joroci> jParkton
[07:29:41] <jParkton> ?
[07:29:44] <joroci> instead of hide()
[07:29:56] <joroci> go .css('visibility','hiddne')
[07:29:59] <joroci> hidden
[07:30:05] <jParkton> hmm
[07:30:08] <joroci> or
[07:30:11] <jParkton> ok lemme try
[07:31:32] <cannap> hidden u mean none?
[07:31:35] <cannap> and block
[07:31:56] <cannap> ah
[07:32:22] <cannap> <-- fail day :P
[07:33:10] <cannap> ah yeah http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_visibility.asp :D
[07:35:41] <needsomehelp> Hello, Im a jquery n00b. I need to add a style to body if a div#toolbar has class stuck. Am I close with this? $(document).load(function({if(#toolbar).hasClass("stuck") {$(body).css("margin-top","30px");}}));
[07:38:19] <ae-r> id use padding top
[07:39:12] <ae-r> otherwise your toolbar is going to get pushed down
[07:39:51] <needsomehelp> no it wont, it has position:fixed
[07:40:14] <needsomehelp> but Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token {
[07:41:26] <ae-r> $('body')
[07:41:35] <ae-r> you need quotes
[07:41:46] <ae-r> body is an element

[07:54:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> ruby_on_tails: hey
[07:54:42] <ruby_on_tails> Rohan_Bhangui: hi
[07:55:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> still up?
[07:55:28] <joroci> aloha
[07:56:04] <needsomehelp> joroci: no error, but css is not added
[07:56:24] <ruby_on_tails> Rohan_Bhangui: almost leaving
[07:56:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol you should hangout here more...that is when your awake
[07:57:54] <joroci> it does in js fiddle
[07:58:49] <needsomehelp> joroci, ae-r: I think the problem is that it only checks once - when the page loads. But the class stuck actually gets added or removed dendending on where you scroll. When you see the page at the top, then it's not there. Scroll some lines down, then it gets added.
[07:59:27] <joroci> yea
[07:59:31] <joroci> it will only check one time
[07:59:40] <joroci> when the page finish loading
[08:00:21] <joroci> how do you add that class?
[08:01:41] <ae-r> probably some sticky plugin? see if they have a callback function u can use
[08:02:06] <ae-r> if not then do it on scroll
[08:02:26] <ae-r> id also throttle the on scroll
[08:03:08] <needsomehelp> ae-r: thats right. http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/shortcuts/sticky-elements/
[08:04:44] <ae-r> have a look at sticky kit
[08:07:59] <needsomehelp> sticky kit?
[08:12:28] <needsomehelp> whats wrong with this syntax? http://pastie.org/8519085
[08:12:35] <needsomehelp> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token {
[08:13:21] <intellilogic> I want to match red, redgreen, but not redblue.  So I turn to regex  ('a:regex(class,red(?:(?!blue))+)); works great.  Then I want to apply multiple and it fails $('a:regex(class,red(?:(?!blue))+), :regex(class,red(?:(?!blue))+) a');  I imagine this is because the expression contains ':', how to resolve this?
[08:26:04] <RonWhoCares> Is it possible to capture the value of "id" if I have several <a>'s , such as:  <a class="reason" id="general_question">General Question</a>
[08:26:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> RonWhoCares: you can using .attr
[08:27:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: you therE?
[08:28:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> intellilogic: are those selectors in css?
[08:29:31] <joroci> RonWhoCares
[08:29:51] <joroci> ofcourse you can
[08:30:23] <RonWhoCares> Rohan_Bhangui: Do I have to have an "href"
[08:30:25] <RonWhoCares> ?\
[08:31:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> RonWhoCares: why would you require href?
[08:31:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> its ideal to have one since its a linkl
[08:31:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> *link
[08:31:57] <RonWhoCares> Rohan_Bhangui: I don't want it, but I am wondering if jQuery will be mad at me
[08:32:28] <RonWhoCares> is this why people do      <a href="#" class="" id="">
[08:33:31] <Fernandos> hi
[08:34:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> RonWhoCares: # refers to the url, in the case of #, to the same page
[08:35:07] <RonWhoCares> ok
[08:35:10] <Fernandos> This adds the same indixes to the tabs as the slider. $(".tabs a").eq(tabsSwiper.activeIndex).addClass('active') But I'd like to addClass on indices that are one lower than the target. -1 causes undefined on the first index..
[08:35:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> if you want to target a specific block in html
[08:35:23] <Fernandos> Any suggestions?
[08:35:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> then you use # in the url to target
[08:38:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> RonWhoCares: did that help?
[08:38:22] <joroci> what should happen if activeIndex is 0/
[08:38:23] <joroci> ?
[08:38:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> joroci: stole question right from my mouth :P
[08:39:21] <joroci> breath taking
[08:39:28] <jedimind> *groan*
[08:42:52] <Fernandos> joroci: The slider (tabsSwiper.activeIndex) jumps in increments of 2. The tabs should increment by one, thus 0 should match 0, but 2 should match 1
[08:46:17] <joroci> ok so
[08:46:35] <joroci> tabsSwiper.activeIndex < 2 ? 0 : tabsSwiper.activeIndex-1
[08:47:02] <joroci> tabsSwiper.activeIndex < 3 ? 0 : tabsSwiper.activeIndex-1
[08:47:08] <joroci> or
[08:47:21] <joroci> tabsSwiper.activeIndex == 0 ? 0 : tabsSwiper.activeIndex-1
[08:47:22] <joroci> :)
[08:47:26] <joroci> you got the point
[08:47:31] <Fernandos> joroci: I tried this: if(tabsSwiper.activeIndex != 0) {idx =tabsSwiper.activeIndex-1; }
[08:48:07] <joroci> should work too
[08:48:13] <joroci> i mean
[08:48:13] <Fernandos> makes it still jump by two, but doesn't return to 0^
[08:48:41] <joroci> $(".tabs a").eq(tabsSwiper.activeIndex == 0 ? 0 : tabsSwiper.activeIndex-1).addClass('active')
[08:49:02] <Fernandos> meh.. forgot to add the idx :)
[08:51:29] <Fernandos> hmm both do the job, but I seem to have a logic error there.. I have a side-navigation, with four icons and each is linked to a set of two slides. What happens is that only two button get active...
[08:51:59] <Fernandos> because two sets 2 set
[08:52:31] <joroci> got a link?
[08:52:33] <Fernandos> eh.. two sets of 2xslides equal the four icons
[08:52:43] <Fernandos> I'll jsbin it
[08:54:12] <RonWhoCares> Thank you for helping me guys

[09:01:57] <Omar-jQM> ajpiano hi, are you free?
[09:02:38] <Omar-jQM> any jQM-related questions?
[09:03:44] <Omar-jQM> anyone experienced in Widget Factory?
[09:04:10] <Justice> I have a <nav><ul><li>in my html5 file. I added a id to the nav and a id to each li. Is there a way to use $(this).attr(id) to get the li ID, because it only gets the root ID for me.
[09:05:21] <Omar-jQM> Justice $( "li" , this).attr( "id" );
[09:05:38] <Omar-jQM> Justice or $(this).find( "li" ).attr( "id" );
[09:05:46] <Fernandos> joroci: I plan to replace the tabs with icon fonts later and replace the first and second slide with another nested vertical slider. So that I have a slide-out navigation with two columns of vertically sliding items
[09:06:50] <Fernandos> well, I have done that already, but have had problems with adding the second column of the nested slider.. so I gave up and started from scratch with that
[09:11:46] <coRz> any questions?
[09:12:31] <Omar-jQM> hey coRz you once asked me about iScroll, I have never used it before. Sorry
[09:13:01] <coRz> Omar, its ok i wont use anyway
[09:13:43] <Omar-jQM> coRz ok, if you need help in jQM, i'll be glad to assist you :)
[09:14:12] <coRz> Thanks ;)
[09:18:58] <Siecje> I'm using jqueryui sortable to move an element and I can move it beside another element but how can I change the element when I move it
[09:19:42] <Siecje> So if I drag an element under another element it will be a sublist
[09:19:44] <coRz> Siecje, you are using dragable?
[09:20:10] <coRz> and sortable?
[09:20:17] <Siecje> right now I can re-arrange the elements
[09:20:23] <Siecje> but they are on the same level
[09:20:59] <coRz> Siecje, do the logic in the drop event of the dropable
[09:21:23] <coRz> and append the item to where ever you want
[09:23:32] <Omar-jQM> coRz are you into widget factory?
[09:24:22] <coRz> Omar, nah dont use it
[09:24:56] <Omar-jQM> ok coRz is there an alternative in your opinion?
[09:26:25] <coRz> Omar, didnt do research on it just not using it, no need for my projects
[09:26:46] <Omar-jQM> ok thanks :)
[09:27:14] <Omar-jQM> jQM questions  *last call*
[09:27:37] <coRz> Omar, np cya :)
[09:27:41] <Siecje> coRz: how do I access the drop event?
[09:28:10] <Omar-jQM> bye coRz enjoy!
[09:28:15] <coRz> Siecje, check in the api i think its ({ onDrop: function(){}})
[09:39:53] <Siecje> in the drop function how do I access the element that was dropped?
[09:43:07] <cubud> Hi al
[09:44:46] <coRz> hi
[09:45:02] <cubud> I have an <input type="file"> on a page that has JQueryMobile in it.  When I click "Select file" and select an image from my gallery focus returns to the browser but the page re-loads so the selected filename disappears.  Does anyone have any idea why this might be?
[09:45:34] <cubud> http://tester.trentinney.co.uk/Product/176181029/Images/Add
[09:45:39] <coRz> Siecje, check the arguments that get passed i think it (dropData, uiElelemt -> you need that)
[09:46:52] <coRz> cubud, strange.. not happening to me
[09:47:07] <coRz> cubud, what mobile phone you trying it on?
[09:47:49] <cubud> Galaxy S3
[09:47:58] <cubud> Tried in the standard browser and Google Chrome
[09:49:07] <coRz> cubud, you are using onchange event on the input?
[09:49:21] <coRz> cubud, maybe something there cousing it to refresh
[09:50:46] <cubud> No, not using any events on it at all
[09:50:52] <cubud> Unless JQueryMobile does
[09:51:51] <coRz> cubud, it looks like you ae talking about a possible postback happening after you add an image
[09:52:35] <coRz> cubud, maybe the form it getting POST and thats why it does post back just do onsubmit="return false;"
[09:52:43] <coRz> on the form
[09:53:41] <cubud> As far as I can see, no
[09:53:52] <cubud> I haven't put any events code in at all
[09:54:37] <coRz> cubud, i need to see the code to figure out what happens
[09:55:22] <cubud> This is the actual page -> http://tester.trentinney.co.uk/Product/176181029/Images/Add
[09:55:59] <cubud> I am just going to disable the jquerymobile for a minute
[09:56:14] <coRz> cubud, you are using c# mvc and the bundles you got are all minified i cant understand that code
[09:56:49] <cubud> Oh I see
[10:00:00] <cubud> Yeah, with jQueryMobile disabled it doesn't refresh
[10:01:42] <coRz> cubud, fyi c# minifier sometimes messes with js code
[10:02:24] <cubud> I just uploaded the site in DEBUG rather than Release and now it works
[10:02:33] <cubud> I wonder if that was also the problem with my page transitions
[10:02:35] <cubud> (checking)
[10:03:58] <coRz> cubud, dont use c# minifier with the bindles i had the same problem
[10:04:13] <coRz> minify with closure comp from google
[10:04:58] <cubud> How do I change that?
[10:05:37] <coRz> remove the bundles and creat a include partial view that will render in the layout
[10:06:08] <cubud> Cheers :)
[10:06:20] <coRz> cubud, np ;)
[10:10:43] <Siecje> I would like to be able to drag Category 2 under Category 1 and have it indented http://jsfiddle.net/8ELRt/1/
[10:12:24] <Siecje> can a <ul> be a .parent()?
[10:15:35] <coRz> $( this ).get( 0 ).tagName;
[10:15:40] <coRz> not the parent
[10:16:14] <coRz> you want category 2 with all of its chidren be able to go above category 1?
[10:18:27] <Siecje> yeah
[10:21:18] <Siecje> so all <ul> should be a div ? or wrapped in a div?
[10:21:49] <Velveeta> siecje: are you asking for a specific use case, or are you asking "in general"?
[10:22:57] <coRz> Siecje, im writing a solution for you
[10:23:19] <Siecje> I need to check if the element being dropped is a category in a category or an idea in a category. But the parent element is not the <ul>
[10:23:44] <Velveeta> i'll just let corz handle that one, since he seems to have all the context :)
[10:29:28] <needsomehelp> Does anyone see where the syntax error is? $(document).ready(function() {$('#toolbar').waypoint('sticky' {offset:30})});
[10:30:11] <Velveeta> after 'sticky'
[10:30:13] <Velveeta> you need a comma
[10:33:40] <needsomehelp> Velveeta: thank you
[10:33:46] <Velveeta> no problemo
[10:36:23] <needsomehelp> I use this jquery plugin: http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/shortcuts/sticky-elements. When you scroll down on that page, you see the bar gets fixed and it gets a new class called "stuck". But how can I add a css to body when that div#toolbar has class stuck?
[10:37:51] <needsomehelp> I have tried the following code, but the problem is that it only check if div#toolbar has clas stuck once - at page load. $(document).ready(function(){ if($('#toolbar').hasClass('stuck')){$('body').css('margin-top','30px');}});
[10:38:22] <pixelpimp> you don't, but you can add it in the callback from waypoint
[10:38:41] <pixelpimp> at run time, $('#toolbar') will not hasClass('stuck'), so that fails
[10:38:47] <pixelpimp> also I sounded like a lolcat saying that...
[10:39:49] <pixelpimp> .waypoint('sticky', { handler: function(direction) { /* set something on the body here */ } })
[10:41:01] <coRz> Siecje, ok first of all you need to nest your ul li correctly: ul li ul li
[10:41:34] <coRz> and add items to the constructor:  $( "#sortable" ).sortable({
[10:41:34] <coRz>         items: 'li'
[10:41:34] <coRz>     });
[10:45:20] <needsomehelp> pixelpimp: should that go inside $(document).ready ?
[10:45:33] <pixelpimp> when you set your waypoint.
[10:45:38] <pixelpimp> wherever that is.  probably, yes.
[10:47:11] <needsomehelp> pixelpimp: http://pastie.org/8519324, nothing is added to body
[10:47:33] <pixelpimp> do it in a fiddle so I can see
[10:48:00] <pixelpimp> pastebins are text.  jsfiddle, codepen, and other similar sites are real code
[10:51:04] <needsomehelp> pixelpimp: http://screammagazine.com/scream2014/board/viewtopic.php?p=2712406#p2712406
[10:51:37] <pixelpimp> I don't know at what I am looking
[10:51:59] <pixelpimp> A poorly photoshopped picture of who I guess is Megadeth's David Ellefson
[10:53:02] <needsomehelp> you see the waypoint toolbar, when you scroll down and #toolbar get stuck, then margin-top:30px is not added to body, as it should
[10:55:53] <pixelpimp> make me a fiddle
[10:56:23] <pixelpimp> debugging on a live site is a lot to sift through
[10:57:30] <needsomehelp> then how do I include both jquery and waypoints?
[10:57:52] <Velveeta> there are options in the left column to include external libraries
[11:04:52] <needsomehelp> it doesnt work in jsfiddle
[11:06:40] <pixelpimp> that would be why you share the link, so we can find out why.......
[11:07:05] <needsomehelp> http://jsfiddle.net/kqw9R/2/
[11:09:37] <Siecje> coRz: what does that do?
[11:12:04] <pixelpimp> needsomehelp: it's firing your code just fine... it's just not being applied for some reason
[11:13:53] <pixelpimp> oh, it doesn't like the !important
[11:20:11] <Velveeta> oh please don't ever use !important unless you absolutely have to
[11:20:53] <Velveeta> most cases that people use !important could easily be handled by just using more css specificity
[11:20:56] <needsomehelp> pixelpimp: I see, but problem now is that the margin leaves a empty space above the banner. I've tried to add an if hasClass in handler function, but then the waypoint bar isn't sticky at all http://jsfiddle.net/kqw9R/4/
[11:21:16] <needsomehelp> Velveeta: yes, by using long css paths. Is that better ?
[11:21:20] <pixelpimp> Velveeta: agreed
[11:22:03] <Velveeta> they don't necessarily have to be long css paths, you can either use a class name to target something, or you can change something like "mySelector" to "body mySelector", just marginally increasing the specificity
[11:23:13] <pixelpimp> needsomehelp: several problems there.  1) you refer to #toolbar but it's not a jquery item, just a string--it does not have .hasClass()
[11:23:39] <pixelpimp> 2) it probably won't have the .stuck class yet at that point
[11:23:46] <pixelpimp> 3) just rely on direction
[11:24:29] <pixelpimp> it'll be 'up' or 'down'
[11:27:34] <needsomehelp> 1) I changed the if to if($('#toolbar').hasClass('stuck'))
[11:27:43] <needsomehelp> but same result
[11:30:57] <needsomehelp> it gets stuck not before you scroll down.
[11:31:03] <needsomehelp> what should I change?
[11:33:40] <Alina-malina> i have this in code : $('.button').unbind('click');   but i dont have a button class, what else this could meen rather then selecting .button class which i dont have anywhere in code
[11:34:57] <Velveeta> alina-malina: did you write that code? because if not, i would say someone else was just putting it in from some time when there used to be button-classed elements in the document
[11:35:28] <Alina-malina> i am not writing it, but there is no class in that code definitely
[11:35:59] <Alina-malina> can this $('.button')  mean other thing?
[11:36:07] <Velveeta> well it just sounds like either inherited code from a time when that was a valid statement, or else 3rd party code as part of a plugin that potentially constructs a button-classed element
[11:36:24] <Velveeta> no, that selector only has one meaning, "all elements with the class 'button' "
[11:37:13] <Velveeta> but that doesn't mean that you don't have other code somewhere that's *creating* those kinds of elements dynamically as part of some 3rd party offering
[11:37:36] <Velveeta> just because you can't find button-classed elements when you search the document, doesn't mean they're not created at some other time when some action is triggered
[11:37:42] <Alina-malina> no it is not, i already remember all the code, there is no anything like that
[11:38:15] <Velveeta> then……. just remove it
[11:39:05] <Velveeta> but i can say that if this is one line of code you're unfamiliar with, it stands to reason there are others out there that you might be unfamiliar with, so "i already remember all the code" isn't a valid statement, or else you would remember this line in question also
[11:40:16] <Alina-malina> let me try it and let you know also there is an ID startgame, but i cant find that id as well, i get crazy, it is mentioned a couple of times in the code, but it is not there as well
[11:40:54] <Velveeta> so then there's one other example of code you're not familiar with.. so i'm not sure how you can make the claim that you remember all the code...
[11:41:16] <Velveeta> it sounds like, at a minimum, there's some 3rd party code in there that you're not familiar w/
[11:41:59] <LekeFly> jQuery(".btn-checkout").addClass("btn-primary btn-large"); how do i make jquery search for multiple classes? i want "btn-checkout" and "another-class" to have btn-primary and btn-large
[11:42:28] <jedimind> add it to the selector?
[11:42:38] <jedimind> ".btn-checkout, .another-class"
[11:42:42] <Velveeta> lekefly: you can just concatenate your class selectors if you want them both (or all) to be present, like this: $('class1.class2.class3')
[11:42:42] <Alina-malina> Velveeta, no there is not, i am exploring this code many days so i know what is where, so ther eis no anything like that
[11:42:53] <Velveeta> and what jedimind said if you're just wanting to search for any of a list of classes
[11:43:00] <Alina-malina> Velveeta, is it possible to check if it exist with console?
[11:43:38] <Alina-malina> [23:43:37.671] $('.button').empty();  something like this
[11:43:40] <Velveeta> alina-malina: how about we get to the heart of what you're asking… are you asking if you can safely remove this code that you can't find a use for?
[11:43:59] <Alina-malina> Velveeta, i am trying to understand if it is necessary or not
[11:44:33] <Velveeta> well you already said that you've read through all of the code, and can't find any instances of a valid .button or #startgame reference, so i would say it's not necessary
[11:44:34] <pixelpimp> Velveeta: I think he menas .class1, .class2
[11:45:03] <Velveeta> pixelpimp: gotcha, then yeah, what jedimind said
[11:53:07] <Siecje> I'm trying to get the parent of a idea element https://dpaste.de/2O26 but there isn't one
[11:53:33] <pixelpimp> !paste
[11:53:33] <b-ot> pixelpimp: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:53:57] <pixelpimp> Siecje: if it's not <html> you have malformed markup or you have a parent
[11:54:23] <pixelpimp> in your case, it's a <ul>
[11:54:55] <coRz> Siecje, put the ul inside the li...
[11:55:12] <pixelpimp> That would be backwards
[11:55:18] <pixelpimp> Unless you mean nesting
[11:55:20] <coRz> i know what he wants
[11:55:20] <Alina-malina> Velveeta, no i cant find that there is definitely no #startgame and .button, i really dont know what else to say, but in prototype(the main function of that game it exist, but redering anyhow)
[11:55:25] <coRz> he dont know how to nest
[11:55:31] <coRz> i tried to explain to him
[11:56:08] <Siecje> so I get a list of the ideas like this idea_list = $('[name="idea"]');
[11:56:21] <Siecje> but how do I access the parent idea_list[0].parent().get(0).tagName;
[11:56:24] <Velveeta> alina-malina: i already suggested that there may be other code creating those elements, even if you're unaware of it, and your response was that you've been all through the code and knew it all and there was nothing like that anywhere… now you're saying you're not sure if there's anything like that somewhere, which is what my original statement was...
[11:56:27] <pixelpimp> pro-tip: name your jQuery'd variables with a $
[11:56:49] <pixelpimp> var $ideaList = $('[name=idea]');
[11:56:54] <Velveeta> alina-malina: if you're wondering if it's truly useless code, just comment it out and use the page as normal and see if it starts throwing errors or behaving unexpectedly
[11:56:54] <Alina-malina> Velveeta, the fact is that code somewhere i cant find it, what is the matter with you?
[11:57:22] <Alina-malina> Velveeta, how to make it run from my computer correctly? it is on webserver
[11:57:35] <pixelpimp> ctrl+shift+f to search sources
[11:57:57] <Alina-malina> pixelpimp, it is in separate file the whoe javascript in one large file namef od script.js
[11:58:15] <pixelpimp> ctrl+shift+f to search *all* sources
[11:58:17] <Velveeta> i'm not even sure what you're asking now… how to edit the files locally that are served up by the webserver?
[11:58:31] <Alina-malina> Velveeta, loool yes
[11:58:44] <pixelpimp> do it in the inspector?
[11:59:50] <Velveeta> and why are you trying to just modify these things locally? those changes are just gonna revert the first time you refresh the page...
[11:59:56] <Velveeta> i'm missing something here
[11:59:58] <SuperTyp> hello all
[12:00:25] <Alina-malina> Velveeta, yes i am trying to modify the script that comes from remote webserver
[12:00:37] <Velveeta> are you trying to modify it permanently?
[12:00:40] <Alina-malina> i only can view the code in inspecotr
[12:00:42] <Velveeta> or just for this one page load?
[12:00:57] <Alina-malina> like you said i want to remove that line, but i don know how, this code comes from webservr
[12:01:23] <Velveeta> and you're trying to remove it from that file permanently?
[12:01:55] <Alina-malina> lol
[12:02:03] <Velveeta> i don't see what's so funny
[12:02:18] <Alina-malina> how to remove permatently if it is on remote webserver
[12:02:28] <Velveeta> you have to modify it on the webserver
[12:02:32] <Alina-malina> no it is not mine
[12:02:38] <Velveeta> then there's nothing you can do
[12:02:48] <Alina-malina> ok
[12:02:52] <Velveeta> that was simple
[12:04:24] <Alina-malina> stupid thing
[12:04:47] <wonderingwork> what would be the easiest way to post data cross domain using jquery?
[12:05:02] <wonderingwork> i don't need to see the response, i just need to post the data
[12:05:05] <pixelpimp> !api ajax
[12:05:05] <b-ot> pixelpimp: No matches.
[12:05:09] <grafi> ha^^
[12:05:11] <pixelpimp> !api jquery.ajax
[12:05:11] <b-ot> pixelpimp: jQuery.ajax(): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:05:40] <wonderingwork> how does that help with cross domain though?
[12:06:10] <wonderingwork> i see the crossDomain function, but that seems too good to be true
[12:07:04] <grafi> look into CORS
[12:08:12] <grafi> or maybe use get requests .. that should work out of the box i think
[12:08:17] <pixelpimp> JSONP
[12:08:26] <pixelpimp> yes, get should work cross-domain anyway
[12:08:47] <wonderingwork> the thing is, i need to post some data to a server that i know nothing about. im trying to automate a form, because the form itself is really redundant and time consuming
[12:09:23] <grafi> well if you know nothing about the server
[12:09:33] <grafi> its going to be hard to post anything xD
[12:09:47] <Siecje> coRz: thanks you were right about wrapping the <li> around the whole section.
[12:09:48] <Siecje> So now I can move ideas and categories but I can't put ideas in a category that is in a category http://jsfiddle.net/8ELRt/5/
[12:09:49] <Velveeta> alina-malina: if you could permanently modify files from your client, on the webserver that you don't own, imagine what people could do to other peoples' websites like google or microsoft.com
[12:09:57] <Velveeta> that's not a stupid thing, it's a security thing
[12:10:24] <Alina-malina> Velveeta, ok ok
[12:10:38] <wonderingwork> all i know is it's apache server, and i know the response/request headers
[12:11:01] <grafi> so you dont actually control the server then?
[12:11:28] <grafi> then its not going to work ;)
[12:11:39] <Alina-malina> loool if i could control all servers:)
[12:11:57] <wonderingwork> damn
[12:12:35] <wonderingwork> i though there was a way to just send post data, don't need anything back, cross domain. that's a bummer
[12:13:02] <grafi> cross domain is always tricky
[12:15:43] <wonderingwork> yeah, i'm just surprised it's so difficult to just send data rather than receive it
[12:17:40] <wonderingwork> can you convert post into get and send it?
[12:17:59] <grafi> the problem is more with the server not accepting stuff from another domain
[12:18:11] <grafi> try posting to say google
[12:18:25] <grafi> and google will say 405 not allowed
[12:19:03] <grafi> and if you send get, if the website is properly programmed it wont know to use that instead of post
[12:19:16] <grafi> or just dont accept it either
[12:19:24] <grafi> depends on the server of course
[12:20:27] <rbs--> I'm trying to invoke events/methods from a jquery-plugin, but it does not work. So I was wondering if someone with some more/better knowledge could gimme a hand to understand how to call an event/method from https://github.com/brianreavis/selectize.js/blob/master/docs/api.md
[12:44:57] <Alina-malina> $('.button').button().click(   what does this function want to say?
[12:45:20] <Alina-malina> is it a jquery built in function?
[12:45:47] <Siecje> http://jsfiddle.net/8ELRt/5/ When I first load the page I can put Category 2 in Category 1 and then I can put Idea 1 in Category 2, but if I take them out then I can't put an idea in a category in a category
[12:46:14] <pixelpimp> .button() is probably jQuery UI
[12:46:19] <pixelpimp> .click() is jQuery
[12:46:28] <pixelpimp> the function you pass to it is your own
[13:21:24] <mathi> hi
[13:22:17] <mathi> I was wondering if I need to url_encode the parameters in my URL. It seems browsers are doing fine without the encoding, and it's more "readable" without encoding
[13:23:58] <mathi> shoky, hey:) maybe you can enlighten me)
[13:26:53] <needsomehelp> Hi, I am adding a margin-top to body with jquery. The value is added, but it is not interpreted. Any idea? http://screammagazine.com/scream2014/board/viewtopic.php?p=2712406#p2712406
[13:43:21] <wonderingwork> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11275378/cross-domain-post-with-greasemonkey
[13:43:39] <wonderingwork> could i use cross domain like that if im not posting from the server i want to post to?
[13:54:54] <shoky> wonderingwork: hmm? are you using greasemonkey?
[13:57:56] <shoky> mathi: not sure what you're asking
[13:59:06] <mathi> shoky, in PHP there is a function urlencode() that encodes certain characters to a % with value, e.g. slash will be %2F. But it seems that browsers don't need this encoding today.
[13:59:24] <mathi> (i'm talking about URLs)
[14:00:18] <duckgoose> mathi http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_encodeuri.asp
[14:01:19] <shoky> mathi: i donno what you're doing with the urls exactly.. anyways if it's not broken..
[14:02:27] <duckgoose> mathi you should always encode url parameters
[14:02:38] <mathi> duckgoose, why ?
[14:03:24] <duckgoose> because when your parameter has & in it you'll find out why
[14:03:34] <duckgoose> or #
[14:03:36] <jax> hm, what's the problem when $('div.question').hide().fadeIn( 4000 ); just displays instead of fades?
[14:05:03] <shoky> jax: hard to say without a demo
[14:05:36] <duckgoose> doing /blah.php?whatever=I+to+to+#+with+&+sometimes will not work without being url encoded
[14:08:41] <obert> jax: you dont need the selector in that syntax
[14:09:08] <jax> ah found it
[14:09:10] <shoky> wat
[14:09:21] <jax> why not obert?
[14:09:34] <obert> jax: .foo is enough
[14:09:43] <shoky> 'div.question' is a selector btw
[14:09:46] <jax> should be faster though?
[14:09:57] <obert> i meant div
[14:09:58] <obert> then:p
[14:09:59] <jax> if it can just check divs for certain classes
[14:10:04] <jax> instead of all elements
[14:10:22] <mathi> duckgoose, thanks you convinced me:)
[14:10:57] <obert> jax: yep ok, it depends on your structure
[14:14:58] <jax> $('div.question').hide().delay(10000).fadeIn( 1000 );
[14:15:03] <jax> any idea why the delay isn't working?

[15:11:08] <jax> hm
[15:11:17] <jax> is there a way to detect if an image is dark and set the color of text to light?
[15:58:52] <mathi> hey
[16:00:03] <mathi> how can I blur an element without calling the jquery blur() handlers attached to it ? (only the default handler that actually unfocus e.g. the textarea)
[16:01:04] <mathi> if I do $('#myTextarea').blur();  it will call the possible jquery blur() event handlers attached to #myTextarea
[16:01:24] <mathi> I only want the default handler to be called
[16:04:49] <mathi> shoky, :$
[16:08:54] <sunbeam> i have a selected="selected" <option> but it doesn't show on top
[16:08:59] <sunbeam> how can i make this display like that?
[16:09:52] <shoky> mathi: $('#myTextarea')[0].blur()
[16:11:56] <mathi> woops
[16:12:00] <mathi> got disconnected
[16:12:17] <mathi> if anyone answered i couldn't see)
[16:15:24] <javalover> hey when using calender api
[16:15:29] <javalover> say I don't have stuff for certain dates
[16:15:34] <javalover> like I know "this date & on nothing is there"
[16:15:37] <javalover> can I disable those dates?
[16:16:10] <javalover> hey mathi
[16:16:12] <javalover> shoky did respond to you
[16:16:19] <javalover> ] <shoky> mathi: $('#myTextarea')[0].blur()
[16:18:03] <mathi> shoky, $(this)[0].blur(); on a textarea will still call my jquery blur() handler on that textarea
[16:24:52] <shoky> mathi: it shouldn't, no.  and that's the same as this.blur()
[16:25:34] <shoky> javalover if you're talking about the datepicker, yes there's a way to disable dates
[16:26:59] <mathi> shoky, well this.blur() does trigger my jquery blur() handler on that element
[16:27:10] <shoky> javalover: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-beforeShowDay
[16:27:18] <mathi> shoky, nevermind, i'll add some dirty code with params
[16:27:28] <shoky> math: i donno what "this" is
[16:27:39] <shoky> mathi*
[16:31:07] <mathi> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/2EVqh/1/     unfocus, and press escape key    =>    when pressing escape, alert shouldn't display, when unfocus, alert can display
[16:31:59] <mathi> shoky, hope I am clear, 1.30 AM here :-p   when user unfocus from textarea, I want to execute code, excepts if he preses ESCAPE, then I must unfocus the textarea and code shouldn't be executed
[16:34:30] <shoky> mathi: k you're right
[16:35:43] <mathi> shoky, my idea is to call trigger with parameters, didn't try yet. do you know any better way ?
[16:36:25] <mathi> oops
[16:36:27] <mathi> back
[16:36:38] <mathi> do you know any better way ?
[16:38:51] <shoky> mathi: i have a feeling that won't work
[16:39:30] <shoky> mathi: http://jsfiddle.net/2EVqh/2/ ;p
[16:40:57] <mathi> shoky, wow, and your code will work safely ??
[16:41:30] <shoky> er depends what you mean by that
[16:41:43] <pixelpimp> may tear a small hole in the space-time continuum
[16:41:49] <shoky> ;]
[16:41:50] <pixelpimp> but just a small one
[16:52:46] <mathi> :)
[16:52:57] <mathi> shoky, I tried with the parameter but it doesn't work. however, it should
[16:52:58] <mathi> http://jsfiddle.net/2EVqh/4/
[16:55:46] <shoky> mathi: yeah, i think it's for the same reason that it still triggers the handler even if you call the native .blur()
[17:01:22] <shoky> mathi: looks like an open issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1367
[17:02:18] <mathi> shoky, its status is closed
[17:02:50] <shoky> mathi: that doesn't mean it's a resolved issue
[17:03:03] <shoky> if you read the last comment "Closed until ...."
[17:03:20] <shoky> and if you check the bugs mentioned, for example  http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13428
[17:03:37] <shoky> it's still open. (it's same issue just with focus() instead of blur())
[17:13:04] <s34n_> I have a plugin that is getting an array for `this`. The array contains one element: a nodeList with the selected collection.

[20:36:10] <Blue__Hat> Hi I have this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/kamron/MrPfE/
[20:36:49] <Blue__Hat> I want to use a second mouseclick to get the box back to the default size set via the css, how do I achieve that?
[20:37:38] <BillCriswell> You can add a class to it and check for the existence of it when it's clicked.
[20:40:27] <Blue__Hat> ok
[20:40:34] <Blue__Hat> let me see
[20:43:52] <BillCriswell> Blue__Hat: If you don't want to manually set the width and height in the JS you might need to use something like jQuery UI's toggleClass
[20:44:34] <Blue__Hat> I am just starting out with JQuery, have no idea how to do that
[20:44:46] <Blue__Hat> just figured I'd fiddle about it today
[20:44:57] <Blue__Hat> will get there eventually thoughanyway
[20:45:18] <BillCriswell> Blue__Hat: Ah. Well, here's a quick demo I did: http://jsfiddle.net/MrPfE/2/
[20:45:57] <BillCriswell> Depending on your requirements you may be able to just use CSS transitions.
[20:46:06] <Blue__Hat> sweet!
[20:46:09] <Blue__Hat> thanks!
[20:46:25] <Blue__Hat> I know about the CSS transitions
[20:46:28] <Blue__Hat> I can do those
[20:46:40] <Blue__Hat> just want to start learning JQuery
[20:47:43] <BillCriswell> ah ok.
[20:48:15] <Blue__Hat> so, look back at my old fiddle
[20:48:21] <Blue__Hat> don't correct it...
[20:49:01] <BillCriswell> Here is a little demo using CSS transitions and jQuery's toggleClass()
[20:49:09] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/orAvUtE/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[20:49:14] <Blue__Hat> I want to get that div blue when it is expanded and back to the original color - red when its back to its original size, would that incorate your fix with a while loop?
[20:51:04] <BillCriswell> Blue__Hat: Not sure what you mean.
[20:51:07] <Blue__Hat> that one looks a lot better with less stress and all the styling is left to css
[20:51:15] <Blue__Hat> ok, let me try to explain
[20:51:52] <Blue__Hat> I want the div, while expanded to be blue
[20:52:17] <Blue__Hat> and once back to the original size, it should go back to the original color
[20:52:44] <Blue__Hat> should I use your suggestion with a "while" loop?
[20:53:05] <BillCriswell> I'm not sure why you need a while loop?
[20:55:10] <Blue__Hat> it can be done otherwise then?
[20:55:46] <Blue__Hat> man, this jquery stuff is wicked cool!
[21:03:04] <BillCriswell> Blue__Hat: You would need an extra plugin for the color transitions.
[21:03:27] <Blue__Hat> oh - thought so...
[21:03:28] <BillCriswell> Blue__Hat: http://jsfiddle.net/MrPfE/4/ and it's using this little plugin: http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/color-animation/jquery.animate-colors-min.js
[21:03:37] <Blue__Hat> how did you learn Jquery?
[21:04:13] <Blue__Hat> I want to get real good at it, so if people ask me questions I can answer as quickly as you did
[21:06:46] <BillCriswell> Blue__Hat: I sit around in here and help a lot. Other than that just using it at work.
[21:07:28] <Blue__Hat> oh - I try to help a lot in the CSS and HTML channels
[21:07:46] <Blue__Hat> I think I can live with the html and CSS I do
[21:08:06] <Blue__Hat> but I need to improve my javascript and jquery
[21:09:02] <BillCriswell_> Tried some Cloud IRC thingie... freaked out on me. =(
[21:10:33] <BillCriswell_> Blue__Hat: Get my last message about just sitting in here and using it at work?
[21:11:18] <Blue__Hat> yeah, got it and i replied: oh - I try to help a lot in the CSS and HTML channels
[21:11:42] <Blue__Hat> I think I can live with the html and CSS I do but I need to improve my javascript and jquery
[21:11:58] <Blue__Hat> and PHP
[21:12:33] <Blue__Hat> after that I doubt I would need to know any more web technologies
[21:12:54] <Velveeta> there's *always* something to be learned
[21:13:08] <BillCriswell_> Blue__Hat: Yeah... love and hate that about web development.
[21:13:17] <BillCriswell_> Never get bored but I never get satisfied.
[21:13:27] <Blue__Hat> yeah...
[21:13:39] <Blue__Hat> there is always somnething more to do
[21:15:48] <Blue__Hat> I want to do more sites, even if its for free
[21:16:00] <Blue__Hat> that way I can get better at what I want to do
[21:18:11] <BillCriswell> Blue__Hat: Yeah I know what you mean. It's been a while since I did anything for free though. All the ones in the past I've done for free just ended badly.
[21:18:48] <Blue__Hat> they usually do
[21:20:01] <Velveeta> yeah, one thing that tends to happen is that if you don't value your time, they don't value your time either
[21:20:15] <Velveeta> and 1 quick job for free steamrolls out of control with scope creep
[21:20:25] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Absolutely.
[21:21:26] <Velveeta> same thing happens in companies when management will bend over backwards for 1 big client or something, they get a crap-ton of feature requests that cause a crap-ton of refactoring for very little gain, none of which is usually transferrable to benefit other customers
[21:21:56] <BillCriswell> The more I charge the more the client listens in my experience, if I charge too little they don't value my opinion nearly as much.
[21:22:16] <Velveeta> but if you try telling them "ok, we can do that, but it'll take 10 of our developers roughtly 2 months of manhours to complete, so we're going to charge you $80000 for that feature", you'll see how quickly a "must have" turns into a "nice to have"
[21:22:17] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Yeah, it's a tough loop to get out of haha
[21:22:39] <Blue__Hat> well, now that you mention it, I always think they put a bit more interest depending on the price
[21:22:43] <Blue__Hat> to a point
[21:24:18] <BillCriswell> Blue__Hat: Agreed.
[21:24:22] <Blue__Hat> but when I do I usually volunteer my time to non-profits
[21:24:46] <Blue__Hat> or churches or people who are for a worthy cause
[21:27:47] <BillCriswell> Blue__Hat: That's good then. It's always great when it feels worth it.
[21:28:59] <BillCriswell> I've been spending a lot of my time trying to understand Drupal.
[21:29:42] <Blue__Hat> well, I see the need to get to know it, Joomla and Wordpress
[21:29:59] <Blue__Hat> weird thing is I haven't had the time to get into any of those
[21:30:29] <Blue__Hat> going to try to figure wordpress out by the end of this coming week - should it take that long?
[21:31:07] <sacho_> a day?
[21:31:18] <sacho_> ah, coming week.
[21:31:31] <BillCriswell> Blue__Hat: I'm not familiar with Wordpress really. I know enough about it to fake it. I do mostly ecommerce stuff.
[21:31:47] <Blue__Hat> sacho_: one week should be sufficient?
[21:31:54] <Blue__Hat> lol
[21:32:09] <BillCriswell> At my new job it's all drupal though... so my brain is melting. I'll get it, though.
[21:32:31] <Blue__Hat> I get people wanting to update their sites by themselves, that's one are where web developers price themselves out of usefulness
[21:32:52] <Blue__Hat> area*
[21:33:14] <Blue__Hat> BillCriswell: one question, JQuery has anything to fix scrollbars?
[21:33:50] <Blue__Hat> I want to style the overflow on a div to a nice scrollbar - that can be done with jquery?
[21:34:12] <BillCriswell> Blue__Hat: That's a CSS thing as far as I know.
[21:35:00] <Blue__Hat> well, I think css scrollbar tweeks only worked on IE - I'm not sure may need to look into it a bit more
[21:35:12] <Blue__Hat> http://cmit.com.jm/templates/template2/
[21:35:30] <Blue__Hat> that's the site I need to get the scrollbar looking good on
[21:37:03] <BillCriswell> Blue__Hat: What website do you think has scrollbars that look good?
[21:37:38] <Blue__Hat> just did this google search and got this: http://manos.malihu.gr/tuts/custom-scrollbar-plugin/complete_examples.html
[21:42:01] <BillCriswell> Blue__Hat: Well, there you go then haha. I never used custom scrollbars. I always felt like scrollbars should be left up to the browser.
[21:42:49] <Blue__Hat> me too, just that my wife suggested on that simple html template I sort of "prettied" it up a bit
[21:52:25] <BillCriswell> Blue__Hat: Got it.
[21:52:49] <Blue__Hat> so, I'm gonna try to implement it now
[21:52:59] <Blue__Hat> will let you know how it goes...
[21:53:57] <BillCriswell> Sounds good!
[22:02:27] <Blue__Hat> BillCriswell: There you have it: http://www.cmit.com.jm/templates/templates2
[22:03:10] <BillCriswell> 404ed
[22:03:13] <Blue__Hat> http://www.cmit.com.jm/templates/template2 sorry bout that
[22:03:49] <BillCriswell> Sweet.
[22:05:52] <Blue__Hat> now, that is nice - apparently you can change the scrollbar styles
[22:10:54] <raj> In terms of execution order, is there any preference for direct eventhandlers vs. delegated events? Or for a more specific selector perhaps (where bubbling may factor in). Or is it simply in terms of what was set first?
[22:15:28] <Blue__Hat> BillCriswell: Well, I'm off to bed - we'll chat again some other time - ok?
[22:15:38] <BillCriswell> Sounds good!
[22:15:41] <BillCriswell> have a good night.
[22:17:53] <Blue__Hat> thanks man - learned a lot
[22:18:07] <Blue__Hat> I'm gonna add this room to my favorites
[22:18:18] <Blue__Hat> you are here a lot - right?
[22:18:24] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[22:18:33] <Blue__Hat> oh - thanks -same to you
[22:18:40] <Blue__Hat> great - we'll meet again
[22:18:54] <BillCriswell> Definitely. Welcome!
[22:22:09] <raj> ahh, seems delegated is after
[22:22:17] <raj> crud
[23:24:40] <dtb> hey just wondering why: $('<a href="http://google.com" class="success_text">Test</a>').attr('href');  doesn't return "http://google.com" - it returns the entire <a> object.
[23:26:12] <dtb> hmm - in google chrome it returns the object, firefox gives me the "Http://google.com" result
[23:30:12] <dtb> hmm - only happens with tinymce loaded on the page. oh well too hard * removes *
[23:39:27] <Frank____> hello
