[00:00:02] <pkafei_> I'm using jquery validator, I'm able to get basic validation working, but custom messages do not appear http://pastebin.com/3EvjajiR
[00:00:11] <pkafei_> Hey Meir`
[00:00:29] <Meir`> you better make a fiddle
[00:04:15] <pkafei_> Meir` ok
[00:04:29] <airdem> can you help me with this vertical text? i cant make it align into the card http://jsfiddle.net/c2L8z52y/2/
[00:05:44] <pkafei_> https://jsfiddle.net/0xc38zsk/
[00:06:02] <Cork> airdem: remove the width value on .text
[00:06:50] <airdem> Cork, but i want the text beeing able to use the whole space of the card
[00:07:53] <Cork> airdem: well currently you're setting the content to be wider then the parent
[00:08:03] <Cork> and that is why it isn't aligning
[00:09:31] <Cork> airdem: also note that when you rotate an element, the layout doesn't take that into account
[00:09:43] <Cork> so you are better of rotating the entire card, instead of just the text
[00:11:51] <airdem> Cork, in my project the text is on the back side of the card and in the end the card get rotated and flipped.
[00:11:57] <airdem> *gets
[00:12:09] <toomus> Cork: What you think about it https://jsfiddle.net/dLkybx2u/5/
[00:12:23] <Cork> airdem: the dom doesn't see the rotated element
[00:12:33] <airdem> but the text has to be rotated before that so that in the end everything looks correct. was that clear enough?
[00:12:37] <Cork> airdem: so the content can't adjust to it
[00:12:47] <Cork> airdem: the elements content is rotated at drawing time
[00:13:03] <Cork> so everything in the dom has no knowledge about it
[00:13:39] <airdem> i thought about rotating the card first, adding text and then flipping it
[00:14:06] <Cork> toomus: ya, that works
[00:14:44] <Cork> airdem: when you use transform, think of it as drawing the content of the element to an image, then use that image as a background in the element
[00:14:48] <Cork> and then rotating the image
[00:14:59] <Cork> the rest stays the same (seen from the dom)
[00:16:19] <airdem> Cork, ill try to put the whole project into a fiddle, maybe you got an idea how to fix it
[00:32:07] <airdem> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/c2L8z52y/9/ this is what i am trying to acheive
[00:32:30] <airdem> maybe you got a better idea how to generate/add the text
[00:33:05] <DragonPunch> Cork: <3
[00:34:07] <airdem> would be nice if the text was centered vertical and horizontal
[00:34:29] <airdem> but after rotating it none of the css props will work
[00:34:32] <Cork> airdem: you can do that
[00:35:22] <Cork> airdem: but you have to adjust the width of the element to do that
[00:35:39] <Cork> airdem: you can absolute position the element to the middle of the card
[00:35:56] <Cork> and then with transform move it so the position is in the middle of the card
[00:36:27] <Cork> the rest is just a matter of adjusting the width and height to it encloses the text without extra space
[00:36:43] <airdem> okay but the text will not be the same every time
[00:36:52] <airdem> no problem, right?
[00:36:58] <Cork> it is
[00:37:14] <Cork> as you what the element to adjust evenly
[00:37:21] <Cork> and there isn't a css way to do that
[00:37:46] <airdem> hmmm can i convert a rotated element to a dom element?
[00:37:47] <Cork> *as you want
[00:37:58] <Cork> not realy
[00:38:03] <Cork> *really
[00:41:52] <airdem> Cork> airdem: you can absolute position the element to the middle of the card
[00:42:21] <airdem> should i use the top/left props or transform-origin?
[00:44:28] <Cork> airdem: http://jsfiddle.net/0sy151Lw/
[00:46:07] <airdem> i cant give the parent (.front in my case) position:relative
[00:46:34] <Cork> i relative isn't a must
[00:46:37] <Cork> it just can't be static
[00:46:57] <Cork> (cause then absolute will be relative to the page)
[00:50:53] <DragonPunch> Cork are u for hire
[00:51:01] <Cork> heh no
[00:51:17] <Mariaa> i am trying to add a custom class to jquery dialog buttons   $('.ui-dialog-buttonpane').closest(".ui-dialog-buttonset")             .find(".ui-button:first") // the first button             .addClass("custom");
[00:51:17] <DragonPunch> Cork are u for cookies
[00:51:20] <Mariaa> but cant
[00:52:24] <Mariaa> http://pastie.org/10119767
[00:53:28] <Cork> Mariaa: $().dialog().dialog('widget').children('.ui-dialog-buttonpane).find('.ui-dialog-buttonset .ui-button').first().addClass('custom')
[00:53:41] <Cork> minus the typos :x
[00:57:57] <ampzamp> anyone know how to fill a box clicked on with a seperate html file - sibngle page site with each box calling html file when clicked/enlarged http://codepen.io/desandro/pen/emJBMR
[00:58:08] <ampzamp> *single
[00:59:00] <Cork> ampzamp: use $().load, but the content you pull should only be the html you want inside the "box"
[00:59:06] <Cork> meaning no <html> <body> and so on
[00:59:51] <Mariaa> nope cork doesn;t work
[01:00:15] <Cork> Mariaa: you're sure the button hve the ui-button class?
[01:00:18] <Mariaa> i have to run a cofirm dialog inside a dialoge
[01:00:24] <Mariaa> yep sure
[01:00:44] <ampzamp> thank you! looking all over for info on doing it with version 2 of isotope
[01:00:50] <Mariaa> http://pastie.org/10119767 Cork
[01:01:21] <Mariaa> i want to add a class to first accept button
[01:02:13] <ampzamp> Cork: yes, it's a single page with isotope boxes and when the box is clicked it enlarges and the html should all show - each box gets a seperate html file.
[01:03:12] <Cork> Mariaa: works fine here https://jsfiddle.net/29fa4a69/
[01:03:35] <Mariaa> http://pastie.org/10119777 is the function for buttons included
[01:03:58] <Cork> Mariaa: pastie is pointless, it requires ppl to render the effect in the head
[01:04:01] <Cork> it isn't useful
[01:04:05] <ampzamp> Cork: oh, i understand the finer point now- that's helpful - will look into that "no <html> <body> and so on"
[01:04:08] <Cork> if you check the fiddle i gave you it works just fine
[01:10:55] <airdem> Cork, seems to work, any critique? http://jsfiddle.net/c2L8z52y/9/
[01:11:22] <airdem> oh wait the update failed
[01:11:41] <airdem> http://jsfiddle.net/c2L8z52y/10/
[01:12:28] <Cork> ya, looks fine to me
[01:12:55] <Cork> so no critique
[01:15:12] <airdem> Cork, thank you for your support!
[01:15:27] <Cork> np
[01:31:01] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/eu83gqkb/35/ <--- how can I pass "buy" outside so that I won't get buy is not defined?
[01:32:17] <Cork> Kartagis: will the .success button ever get clicked before the ajax call has succeeded?
[01:32:43] <Kartagis> no
[01:34:23] <Cork> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/eu83gqkb/36/
[01:34:57] <Cork> Kartagis: that said, just storing the same info as a dataset value in btn is prob a cleaner solution
[01:36:41] <Kartagis> Cork: oh, the (function() { ... })() means when the dom is ready?
[01:36:53] <Cork> no
[01:37:11] <Cork> that is a self executing function, also normally called a scope
[01:37:17] <Cork> it just creates a namespace
[02:27:51] <airdem> http://spruchkarten.hol.es/ works fine in firefox but is messed up in chrome, any ideas?
[02:28:08] <Cork> define "messed up"
[02:29:19] <airdem> Cork, i guess you dont have firefox?
[02:29:39] <Cork> you need to define what breaks so ppl know what to look for
[02:29:44] <airdem> Cork, there should be a 3x3 of card decks
[02:29:56] <airdem> but the positions are not correct in chrome, at least for me
[02:30:12] <airdem> they are all pretty much located in the top left corner
[02:31:07] <Cork> you're calculation of the offset is breaking
[02:31:32] <elitepete> I'm trying to replace a input element with a select element of the same name - I'd appreciate it if someone could take a look to see what I am doing wrong: http://jsfiddle.net/mrgdsbxr/
[02:31:39] <Cork> can't even find where you calcualte it
[02:31:42] <Cork> *calculate
[02:32:11] <airdem> Cork, shall i pasteb or tell you in which file it is?
[02:32:51] <Cork> elitepete: newInput.attr('name', 'name="replaceme[1]"'); == <select name="name=&#x22;replaceme[1]&#x22;">
[02:32:56] <airdem> http://spruchkarten.hol.es/js/main.js look for: // create a 3x3 grid of decks containing 9 cards each
[02:33:17] <elitepete> thanks Cork - I'll take a look
[02:33:38] <Cork> airdem: check what card.width() gives you
[02:34:21] <airdem> Cork, 0 :)
[02:34:27] <Cork> there you go
[02:34:52] <airdem> so firefox applies the css width without the need to append card to DOM?
[02:35:07] <Cork> ya
[02:35:41] <Cork> or it might be cause of some other rule that chrome delay cause of optimizations
[02:35:57] <elitepete> Cork: I've updated the fiddle but it still isn't working - oldInput.remove() does not even seem to be firing: http://jsfiddle.net/mrgdsbxr/1/
[02:37:03] <Uhkis> elitepete: your oldInput is just a string, not a jquery object
[02:37:21] <elitepete> oh yeah Uhkis , cheers
[02:37:28] <Cork> elitepete: anyway why not just have both the input fields in the dom
[02:37:33] <Cork> and just hide show them as needed?
[02:37:42] <Cork> it would simplify this quite a bit
[02:38:28] <elitepete> perfect, it's working now http://jsfiddle.net/mrgdsbxr/2/ - thanks Uhkis and Cork
[03:23:37] <lessless> hey folks, how to trigger an 'input' event with jquery?
[03:23:48] <lessless> the code I use now for Chrome is document.getElementById('ck-editor').dispatchEvent(new Event('input'));
[03:32:16] <Cork> lessless: $('#ck-editor').trigger('input')
[03:33:44] <jedrek> is there a best-of-class lightbox for displaying youtube videos?
[03:33:53] <lessless> Cork, nope, the result is not the same

[05:01:22] <VanReyes> Is it possible to add text and codes to html file using input box?
[05:02:54] <samssh> VanReyes, You mean edit the files on the server by a text input/textarea?
[05:03:08] <VanReyes> Yes samssh
[05:03:16] <samssh> Not with JQuery.
[05:03:27] <VanReyes> How to do that?
[05:03:34] <samssh> You would need something server-side to make the changes.
[05:03:59] <VanReyes> Ohh I see
[05:05:09] <VanReyes> Actually, I want to send a image on a email. And one way to send image with text on a email is to code it on html file. That why I want whatever I type on the text, will be saved to html file.
[05:05:27] <VanReyes> I'm not sure if my logic is correct. Just figuring out things
[05:05:33] <VanReyes> Any idea mr samss?
[05:05:43] <samssh> VanReyes, You don't need to save an HTML file to send an HTML email.
[05:06:17] <VanReyes> I've tried to send a image on the email but on email, it only receive the code.
[05:06:18] <samssh> VanReyes, Have you done any server-side coding? PHP, Node, Ruby, etc?
[05:06:25] <VanReyes> Yes PHP
[05:06:56] <samssh> Are you using any frameworks? Or just vanilla PHP?
[05:07:07] <VanReyes> fuelphp framework
[05:07:33] <VanReyes> in fuelphp, one way to send inline image is using html.
[05:07:42] <VanReyes> I'm pretty new to all this thigns
[05:07:45] <VanReyes> including jquery
[05:07:48] <samssh> VanReyes, Ok, I'm not familiar with fuel. You should see if there is an IRC chat for fuel.
[05:08:14] <VanReyes> Already there.
[05:08:31] <samssh> Are you getting any answers responses from them?
[05:08:38] <samssh> *answers, responses
[05:11:27] <VanReyes> Yeah, but not direct to the point. Still figuring out it myself.
[05:11:32] <samssh> VanReyes, The basic idea for an html email is often to render a template, basically the same way you create a view, only instead of echoing out, you built a string.
[05:12:19] <samssh> Your text input gets put into the view. However, you have to be very careful if you are allowing users to input html.
[05:13:31] <VanReyes> Yes. It's okay. This is only for the admin.
[05:14:01] <VanReyes> I just wonder why if it's possible to upload and send the uploaded image on email.
[05:16:17] <Repox> I get this error: "Uncaught TypeError: $ is not a function" - the line occurs on line 1 on http://pastie.org/10120214 - what am I doing wrong?
[05:16:18] <samssh> VanReyes, Even allowing admins to input html is potentially dangerous. Regardless, you need to do some research on inline email messages.
[05:16:51] <samssh> Repox, Did you include JQuery in your page before that?
[05:21:57] <VanReyes> @repox: remove the ;
[05:28:24] <samssh> VanReyes, Sorry, I said "inline email messages", when I meant inline image email messages.
[05:28:55] <flexpaint> http://podliberty.com/drup/ why does this autocomplete search work in the body but not in the side menu
[05:41:54] <kk_drop> I have this situation on one of client sites (don't have full control on code).  I'm using bootstrap and tooltip functionality. and for example on login form I when I hover for a first time tooltip works well, but after second hover it shows and dissapears immediately
[05:42:17] <VanReyes> Is is possible to read html tags from a input box such as textarea?
[05:54:05] <Kartagis> VanReyes: an example? you want to read attributes?
[05:56:06] <VanReyes> Exam is an email, I want to type in img tag and send.
[05:56:11] <VanReyes> example*
[05:56:27] <VanReyes> So that the time email will receive image not code.
[05:57:16] <Cork> VanReyes: its still just tags
[05:57:30] <Cork> VanReyes: the rendering happens cause the email tells the client its embeded html
[05:57:38] <Cork> not sure it isn't html as text
[05:57:47] <Cork> so it has nothing to do with the textarea
[05:58:24] <VanReyes> Okay thanks cork.
[05:58:35] <VanReyes> So how can I send a image to email?
[05:58:47] <Cork> VanReyes: depends on what you mean by send
[05:59:11] <Cork> if you mean you send this info to a server, and the server sends an email, it all depends on the server
[05:59:24] <VanReyes> for example I will send you on gmail and I want to have an image and put again a text after image.
[05:59:26] <Cork> if you mean something else, it depends on what you're usign
[05:59:42] <Cork> VanReyes: what does this have to do with the textarea?
[06:01:02] <VanReyes> Because currently, I using wyswig to upload image url. Image is already being viewed on my textarea. But it when the time it receive on email. only the code is receive, not the email. I don't need to have server because image is being uploaded using image url.
[06:01:21] <VanReyes> wyswyg*
[06:01:43] <VanReyes> not the image*
[06:05:20] <VanReyes> Is is possible cork?
[06:06:12] <Cork> VanReyes: email clients normally don't pull images from external resources
[06:06:35] <Cork> VanReyes: so if you want the email to include the image you need to mime encode the image into the email
[06:06:52] <Cork> VanReyes: just sending the html you got from the wyswig won't make it an html email
[06:07:43] <VanReyes> Hmnn. Yes, I actually know how to send inline image using html file. But I want to upload it not coding it directly on the html file.
[06:08:10] <Cork> VanReyes: well then you have to make files upload
[06:08:21] <Cork> and this has nothing to do with the textarea
[06:08:30] <Cork> it's all down to the server code
[06:15:20] <VanReyes> Hmnn okay. Thanks cork
[06:48:00] <xqo> hi, my setter function is giving me maximum call stack exceeded: http://jsfiddle.net/pu5oo01v/1/
[06:57:46] <Cork> xqo: ya, cause you set lol from lol (line 3)
[06:58:19] <xqo> Cork what should it look like?
[06:58:37] <Cork> xqo: http://jsfiddle.net/pu5oo01v/2/
[06:58:54] <Cork> xqo: also note __define*_ is deprecated
[06:59:08] <xqo> Cork what is the new way?
[06:59:20] <xqo> i want to be able to define the getter and setter in the constructor of my object
[06:59:25] <Cork> ?api defineProperty
[06:59:25] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[06:59:30] <Cork> ?mdn defineProperty
[06:59:31] <b-ot> Cork: Object.defineProperty() - JavaScript - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty
[07:00:07] <xqo> oh you can defineProperty on "this", that's nice.
[07:02:26] <xqo> thank you, Cork
[07:02:29] <Cork> np
[07:02:40] <Cork> xqo: defineProperty can define the setter and getter at the same time
[07:02:45] <Cork> so it's cleaner
[07:02:54] <Cork> i can also set if the value are listable and so on
[07:02:58] <xqo> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/pu5oo01v/4/, yes?
[07:03:09] <Cork> yup
[07:03:16] <xqo> thank you
[07:05:28] <Cork> heh *it can also :)
[07:09:04] <xqo> Cork must the value exist already, before the getters? am i missing any "var" or anything here? http://jsfiddle.net/pu5oo01v/5/
[07:10:06] <Cork> xqo: yes, your creating a global name here
[07:10:18] <Cork> name = <value> === window.name = <value>
[07:18:57] <limdauto> hi everyone, I'm trying to upgrade from jQuery 1.x to 2.x and ran into a problem with running it in a node environment. Please see the question here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29945046/stubbing-jquery-ajax-in-node-environment-jquery-2-x
[07:19:26] <Cork> limdauto: you might want to stick to the 1.9+ branch
[07:19:35] <Cork> 2.0 drops support for older browsers
[07:19:52] <limdauto> Aye I don't have to support IE8 so I'm good with 2.x. Thanks though.
[07:27:43] <BarnaSzalai> hi
[07:28:48] <BarnaSzalai> if i have a string how to make it a class from it? so var x = 'something'; $('.' + x).find(...) doesnt work
[07:30:05] <limdauto> that should have worked. Does the element you are trying to find exist?
[07:30:29] <BarnaSzalai> hm
[07:30:38] <BarnaSzalai> i have to check
[07:32:03] <BarnaSzalai> my bad. its an id not a class
[07:32:04] <BarnaSzalai> ehh

[07:32:32] <Koopz> DataTables question... does ajax pagination only work with serverside processing?
[07:33:26] <kayyy> Hey Guys - I want to protect my magento shop with a "pre opening". So a user can enter a code and has then access to the site. Is there any jquery plugin avaiable or something like that ?
[07:34:28] <BarnaSzalai> whats wrong with the magento login system?
[07:34:51] <Cork> kayyy: you never want to do that kind of restriction in client code
[07:34:58] <Cork> kayyy: it should always be done server side
[07:35:10] <kayyy> so - php ? :)
[07:35:18] <Cork> ya
[07:37:14] <decx> you dont need to write anything, any old server will be able to restrict directories with user/pass
[07:38:40] <kayyy> yep - but we have a shop based on shopware. And we want to do a "pre opening". So any user with a code can access the site.
[07:57:17] <Koopz> .htaccess would still work, though it wouldn't look that good
[07:59:11] <airdem> data.replace('/\r?\n/g', ''); shouldn't this remove \r\n and \n?
[08:07:21] <nbt> airdem: try removing the quotes from the first argument
[08:07:31] <nbt> data.replace(/\r?\n/g, '');
[08:12:16] <coderman1> would anyone happen to know how to capture the state of a hidden row in a datatable? im filtering rows with teh search bar and then have a button that saves what the user selects (checkbox) however the rows that are checked that are hidden due to the filter are not getting saved
[08:16:09] <xqo> when defining objects, should you stringify the keys or not? {1:{size:4}} vs {1:{"size":4}}
[08:19:08] <nbt> xqo: you can omit the quotes if it's a valid identifier or number
[08:19:31] <xqo> yes but is there some convention? if i can choose, what is preferable?
[08:20:34] <nbt> you can do either, but if for example your key is "a-b", you need the quotes
[08:21:50] <nbt> but if your key is a valid identifier, I would just use it unquoted
[08:58:30] <AlphaAtom> does anyone know of a jquery library that supports smooth scrolling and callbacks when the scroll is complete?
[09:00:00] <robertmaxrees> you should be able to do that yourself.
[09:00:12] <robertmaxrees> assuming by "smooth scroll" you mean animated window scrolling.
[09:01:42] <Velveeta> i was thinking the inertial scrolling that happens on handheld devices
[09:02:09] <robertmaxrees> hah.  this is why clarity is a good thing.
[09:02:17] <Velveeta> rightio
[09:02:24] <Velveeta> how are things going in your world
[09:02:39] <robertmaxrees> eh.  could be better.
[09:02:40] <robertmaxrees> yours?
[09:03:23] <Velveeta> busybusybusy.. this react project has constant demos and deadlines, and at the same time, we're waging a multi-faceted offense against our architecture committee to get nodejs approved for use as a middle tier option across the company
[09:04:11] <Velveeta> so i have the onus of greenfielding a project, combined with vetting and proving this out as a concept
[09:04:27] <robertmaxrees> neat
[09:04:28] <Velveeta> and i have to start playing with webdriver in the next week or 2
[09:04:46] <robertmaxrees> ooooh.
[09:04:49] <robertmaxrees> good luck with that one.
[09:05:00] <Velveeta> it was recommended by our angular team that i look into protractor, but that's really just a specialized wrapper around webdriver for use with angular lookup conventions
[09:05:15] <robertmaxrees> webdriver can do a lot of great things.
[09:05:19] <Velveeta> i was considering writing a new locator file for it to be used with react conventions, at least in part
[09:05:27] <robertmaxrees> just a bit of a learning curve.
[09:05:38] <Velveeta> yeah, the goal is to make automated ui testing that's less fragile than your standard selenium tests
[09:05:39] <robertmaxrees> if jquery is available on the page, you can use that.
[09:05:50] <robertmaxrees> yeah we use selenium with webdriver.
[09:05:58] <AlphaAtom> yeah i do just mean animated window scrolling
[09:06:04] <Velveeta> so i don't want to tie to things like classnames and id's
[09:06:22] <Velveeta> i'd rather be able to do lookups on embedded components using the react test utils
[09:06:37] <Velveeta> but the webdriver by.js function seems like it should allow for that sort of thing
[09:10:43] <robertmaxrees> AlphaAtom one sec.  that's pretty easy.
[09:11:44] <snover> Velveeta: intern (https://theintern.github.io) is an agnostic testing system that provides more features and uses the standard webdriver api. it’s what pep uses and what jquery mobile is moving toward. it includes guidance on how to abstract pages or components, https://theintern.github.io/intern/#page-objects
[09:12:04] <Velveeta> nice, thanks, i'll take a look at that :)
[09:13:36] <Velveeta> that matrix is definitely promising

[09:27:43] <pkafei_> Greetings party people!
[09:29:18] <robertmaxrees> good morning pkafei_ :)
[09:32:09] <printForever> TypeError: $(...) is nullLine 2
[09:32:21] <robertmaxrees> is jquery loaded?
[09:32:24] <printForever> when I try running a simple line in Firebug Console
[09:32:26] <printForever> yes
[09:32:33] <robertmaxrees> try doing $.fn.jquery
[09:32:36] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[09:32:43] <printForever> TypeError: $.fn is undefined

[09:33:02] <printForever> jQuery.fn.jquery

[09:33:07] <robertmaxrees> you're in noconflict mode.
[09:33:14] <robertmaxrees> you need to use jQuery instead of $
[09:33:21] <printForever> oh for... cry...
[09:33:23] <printForever> yeah...
[09:33:26] <printForever> thanks
[09:33:30] <printForever> geez
[09:34:53] <printForever> its working...
[09:38:49] <AlphaAtom> thanks robertmaxrees, i'll have to take a further look at animate to do what i wanna do tho
[09:39:10] <robertmaxrees> AlphaAtom there's a callback in there that runs when it's complete.
[09:39:12] <robertmaxrees> pretty basic stuff.
[09:40:43] <AlphaAtom> yeah but i wanna scroll the window not a div
[09:40:56] <AlphaAtom> is it the same sorta thing
[09:40:57] <robertmaxrees> AlphaAtom then do $(window) instead of the div :)
[09:56:33] <Guest60374> Hi, everyone. Would anyone be able to tell me why the Helper of UI-Sortable gets offset when the parent has paddings, margins / weird positions, w/e ?
[10:03:13] <pkafei_> Trying to validate a form using jquery validatation plugin. Basic validation works, but custom messages do not appear https://jsfiddle.net/hzxjfonf/
[10:05:56] <rocky> i don't suppose anyone has experience with jquery.usmap.js ?  i'm having a hard time showing the state abbr's on the map... even with option showLabels: true
[10:06:14] <robertmaxrees> pkafei_ are you sure it's not a styling issue?
[10:07:48] <pkafei_> robertmaxrees I'm sorry, not sure what do you mean by styling issue.
[10:08:25] <robertmaxrees> pkafei_ when you say the custom messages "do not appear", is it because you have styling that may have hidden them?  open your inspector and see if the document is getting updated.
[10:10:17] <pkafei_> robertmaxrees the document is getting updated
[10:10:26] <robertmaxrees> so you see the error messages there?
[10:10:32] <robertmaxrees> sounds like maybe a css problem then.
[10:12:57] <damarusama> I am trying to do something really simple, instead of having a document.ready function whitin my html page, I want the script to be external
[10:13:06] <damarusama> I am installing http://fullcalendar.io/docs/usage/
[10:13:32] <damarusama> but i get a TypeError: $(...).fullCalendar is not a function
[10:13:39] <robertmaxrees> you can put document ready in external js files.
[10:13:48] <robertmaxrees> and that means that you're trying to use fullCalendar before it's loaded.
[10:13:48] <damarusama> really ?
[10:13:57] <_Ronald> Only, after you loaded the jQuery library, though
[10:14:03] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:14:10] <damarusama> yeah jquery is loaded
[10:14:14] <damarusama> ok
[10:14:17] <robertmaxrees> as long as the external script is after jquery, you're fine.
[10:14:31] <damarusama> I though the the document ready was only for the document the script was in
[10:14:32] <robertmaxrees> file order should be jquery, any plugins, your code.
[10:14:32] <damarusama> my bad
[10:14:50] <robertmaxrees> damarusama script tags include the js in the current document :)
[10:14:53] <pkafei_> hey robertmaxrees. There are no errors. It might be a css issue
[10:15:24] <pkafei_> robermaxrees thanks for your help
[10:15:27] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[10:16:02] <Azrael_-> hi
[10:16:52] <Azrael_-> is there a channel which is the best place to ask some questions about datatables-plugin for jquery? (datatables.net)
[10:17:13] <robertmaxrees> Azrael_- i've asked them to make a channel and they've said "no".
[10:17:27] <Azrael_-> mind if i ask here?
[10:17:30] <robertmaxrees> they have forums available that can be hit and miss.  you could also ask here, but don't expect any answers.
[10:18:19] <_Ronald> Would anyone know what causes Positional offset on the UI Sortable helper?
[10:18:37] <robertmaxrees> _Ronald you might get more help if you can make a test case in a fiddle or bin.
[10:19:10] <_Ronald> i could try, but its kind of a whole system, not just the sorting. lo
[10:19:23] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[10:19:26] <robertmaxrees> that's not a test case.
[10:19:42] <_Ronald> I know; =p
[10:19:43] <robertmaxrees> https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[10:19:47] <Azrael_-> just found the answer :)
[10:19:52] <robertmaxrees> Azrael_- great!
[10:19:53] <_Ronald> which is why i will try creating a fiddle, on the problem itself
[10:20:11] <robertmaxrees> _Ronald otherwise, fixingthesejquery.com/ might be a good resource for you.
[10:20:35] <_Ronald> Maybe, a maybe everywhere=p
[10:27:54] <_Ronald> wrats, im trying to create the fiddle, and i selected jquery 1.9.1, and checked jQuery UI 1.9.2, but it says sortable doesn't exists, any ideas? Do i need to customly add UI ?
[10:28:58] <xqo> can you change what an object should return when it is referenced? Thing = {name: "Jack"}; I want it so that when i do Thing+" Daniels", I get "Jack Daniels"
[10:29:33] <_Ronald> Thing.name += " Danials";
[10:30:11] <_Ronald> " Daniels"; * ^^
[10:31:35] <igyiguygyu> a
[10:42:07] <_Ronald> Would anyone know how i can remove the offset on the jquery ui helper? jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/LbL580ov/3/
[10:42:15] <_Ronald> jquery ui sortable helper *
[10:55:19] <_Ronald> Would anyone know how i can remove the offset on the jquery ui sortable helper? jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/LbL580ov/3/
[11:00:17] <tasaif> _Ronald: css
[11:00:36] <_Ronald> A little broad? Could you narrow that down? what do you mean.
[11:00:54] <tasaif> one sec
[11:00:56] <cj> is there an easy way to get the first value of an object?  I know javascript uses positioned hashes unlike perl...
[11:03:24] <cj> for (var first in obj) break;
[11:03:31] <cj> one step away from that
[11:04:05] <tasaif> _Ronald: https://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/LbL580ov/4/
[11:04:39] <NitroLiq> Can someone help me out with how I can get .wrap() working on some clones? http://jsbin.com/xoxoqiteme/1/
[11:04:50] <NitroLiq> I thought in the return function I could say something like nodes[3].wrap(nodes[4])
[11:05:42] <NitroLiq> to wrap the a href around the img
[11:06:09] <_Ronald> tasaif; you changed the widths from the items, to the container of the items.
[11:06:30] <tasaif> what/
[11:06:31] <tasaif> ?
[11:06:48] <tasaif> cj have you tried .first()
[11:06:48] <tasaif> ?
[11:06:50] <_Ronald> That is not a valid solution to my problem; Let me explain. I am building a sitebuilder, which allows the client to manipulate elements to the core; paddings margins, floats custom styles, whatever, name it. Some of the styles cause offsets, the margins for instance.
[11:10:37] <tasaif> I don't understand, hopefully someone with more insight will come to your rescue
[11:11:51] <_Ronald> I know that the margin auto is the reason for the offset. or in any case, absolute / relative positioning, all would offset the helper. I would care for a jquery ui sortable solution, that would take the correct positional values of the container it is dragging.
[11:12:47] <tdignan> I would like to perform a search using jquery on all script tags, to match against the text contained between them... i.e. the actual JS code. I tried $("script") and it pulled all the script tags. Next I tried $("script").first().text() to get the text, but it returned "". Any way to get the code?
[11:13:18] <_Ronald> a script tag, does not return text, it returns html
[11:13:26] <_Ronald> use html() instead of .text(),
[11:15:36] <tdignan> _Ronald: awesome, works as desired. Thank you.
[11:15:55] <tdignan> any idea how I could get the scripts with src= attributes, or would I have to actually write code to pull them from the network?
[11:16:42] <_Ronald> @tdignan; what do you mean, with src= attributes?
[11:17:37] <_Ronald> if you have the script elements, like $('script').first().attr('src') // That would return the value on the src attribute.
[11:17:59] <tdignan> makes sense, thank you. I just had a facepalm when I saw the search code box in chrome.
[11:18:06] <tdignan> I was trying to do it in the console with code.
[11:18:15] <tdignan> nevertheless I think this has all been educational.
[11:18:23] <tdignan> thank you very much for your assistance
[11:19:18] <_Ronald> No problem, happy it worked out for you.
[11:25:02] <mbrzuzy> I still get confused with prop vs attr. Would ID on an element be a property or an attribute
[11:25:47] <tasaif> isn't it both?
[11:26:51] <tasaif> here's a thing that looks popular enough to be real http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5874652/prop-vs-attr
[11:35:51] <_Ronald> tasaif; I fixed the problem by creating a temporary stylesheet, and aiming reset styles at the sorted element (Which is display: none when being sorted) That fixes the offset, and on stop: i remove the stylesheet.
[11:39:15] <tasaif> _Ronald: I'm happy you found a solution :)
[11:40:00] <AlphaAtom> `paste
[11:40:00] <b-ot> AlphaAtom: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:40:11] <Synthead> is there a jQuery (or even JS) equivalent to Python's all()?  I want to see if an array contains only empty arrays.
[11:41:43] <mbrzuzy> .filter possibly
[11:41:58] <AlphaAtom> when i run this code, http://fixee.org/paste/kwuoois/ it says something about $window being undefined
[11:43:15] <AlphaAtom> even when i replace $window with $(window) it still says cannot use in to search for scrollTop in undefined
[11:45:40] <_Ronald> thank you for the help, to everyone involved; Till next time!
[11:48:54] <AlphaAtom> never mind fixed it myself, used $('body') instead of $(window)
[12:22:50] <v0lksman> is there any way to snoop on javascript/jquery triggers?  something is hiding an element on my page but I can't figure out what.
[12:23:16] <thealphanerd> v0lksman: have you used the develop tools to set break points in your code?
[12:23:51] <v0lksman> I never have no
[12:24:16] <v0lksman> got any good docs on that?
[12:26:30] <thealphanerd> one sec :D
[12:26:51] <thealphanerd> http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/
[12:30:14] <v0lksman> wow...awesome...will have to check that out in detail
[12:30:50] <v0lksman> before I do though, I console.logged a bunch of intermediate steps and see something weird
[12:31:59] <v0lksman> I'm building an unordered list, the element that is acting weird is an img tag in the li
[12:32:07] <v0lksman> https://dpaste.de/DoX6
[12:33:08] <v0lksman> there is the code...for some reason the img tag ends up with width and height set to 0, and inline style that is basically hiding the image.
[12:33:26] <v0lksman> is it doing that because the ul/li is hidden until the end of my for loop?
[12:35:04] <AlphaAtom> sometimes when I animate scrollTop I see a flash of the top of my page first then it animates the scroll
[12:39:03] <AlphaAtom> fixed it again, i should probably just use google more often
[13:18:10] <cjohnson> If I want to find nodes which have http URLs referenced, how can I make the "starts with" selector be case insensitive? ie $('[src^=http:],[href^=http:]')
[13:18:18] <cjohnson> but I want to match Http: or HTTP: or whatever else
[13:18:58] <cjohnson> is there a way to do this without breaking it out into a filter function?
[13:32:48] <v0lksman> after all that it was adblock...geeeeeeeez
[13:42:49] <Ownix> is there a way to break the references to a jqeury object?
[13:43:16] <Ownix> var myNewObj = $('#myID'); and then doing mynewObj.hide() will have no effect?
[13:43:43] <Ownix> I need to grab an element and then delete stuff from it and then apply it elsewhere but I dont want to be manipulating the DOM when I do that
[13:51:39] <cjohnson> myNewObj will still refer to the same collection of nodes
[13:51:55] <cjohnson> the only thing that will change the collection, I believe, is .remove (or similar)
[13:53:13] <cjohnson> hrm nope, looks like not even that will alter the original collection
[13:53:27] <cjohnson> it's removed from the DOM but the node still exists
[13:54:09] <cjohnson> what do you mean by "delete stuff from it and then apply it elsewhere"? deleting stuff from an element will be manipulating the DOM
[13:55:18] <bepolite> hey arschmitz  got a sec?
[13:58:56] <Ownix> cjohnson: I want to use this https://gist.github.com/insin/1031969
[13:59:12] <Ownix> You can see the function that is returned takes a table right?
[13:59:22] <Ownix> I want to pass it $('table')[0]
[13:59:42] <Ownix> But before that I have to dig into that and .remove() a whole bunch of crap that wouldnt make sense to have in an excel document like menus
[14:00:11] <Ownix> So right now I am doing var tableClone = $('table').clone()[0]; then tableClone.remove('.menu')
[14:38:01] <acidjazz> you are doing[0] Ownix
[14:38:07] <acidjazz> which removes the jqueryness from the clone
[14:38:11] <acidjazz> which makes .remove fail
[14:38:21] <acidjazz> remove teh [0] and use that only when you want to return the html of your clone
[14:58:46] <arschmitz> bepolite: still here?
[14:59:31] <ashopin> Evening. My brain is mush and I can't figure out why this won't work. http://pastebin.com/qRaTaH13 I want to loop over a repeating field I have and add up the values and hten assign the value to a "total" field.
[15:00:16] <_shaggy> hey ne body help !!
[15:00:18] <_shaggy> i have a server hosted on some ip and i am now trying to build a javascript layer to access those api and inorder to manage session i need to manage cookies
[15:00:19] <bepolite> yep arschmitz
[15:00:41] <arschmitz> bepolite: how can i help you?
[15:00:42] <_shaggy> how can i access all the cookies of an ajax response
[15:00:53] <bepolite> can I pm arschmitz ?
[15:00:58] <arschmitz> sure
[15:01:09] <_shaggy> i can view those cookies in web console but success:function(res, status, xhr) {   			 	alert(xhr.getAllResponseHeaders()); 			},  gives output null
[15:01:46] <_shaggy> arshmitz if possible help me out !
[15:02:14] <bepolite> _shaggy: I will sugest you ask at _shaggy
[15:02:15] <_shaggy> arschmitz :P sorry wrng nick !
[15:02:37] <_shaggy> common please help me out  :/
[15:03:27] <_shaggy> bepolite help me bro dont js laugh me off FFS
[15:03:28] <_shaggy>  :P
[15:03:53] <arschmitz> _shaggy: your trying to get all the cookies for the current page?
[15:04:11] <bepolite> _shaggy: sorry that was a mistake
[15:04:49] <arschmitz> _shaggy: document.cookie contains a string with key value pairs for all the cookies available to the current page
[15:05:06] <_shaggy> means i am trying to acess all cookies of a specific ajax request's response
[15:05:22] <arschmitz> you can only access cookies for the current page
[15:05:46] <_shaggy> but you can see the cookies through web console !!
[15:06:06] <arschmitz> _shaggy: what do you mean?
[15:06:27] <_shaggy> means from page at http://a i am sending an ajax request to  http://b and want to access the cookies of the response from http://b
[15:06:44] <arschmitz> you cant cookies are not part of the ajax response
[15:07:04] <arschmitz> cookies are store on the users machine
[15:07:10] <arschmitz> and accessed by the browser
[15:07:28] <_shaggy> but u can atleast access response cookies
[15:07:42] <arschmitz> security only allows you to access cookies on the current domain
[15:07:54] <arschmitz> so you can never access cookies from http://b on http://a
[15:08:11] <_shaggy> not possible by any means !!
[15:08:13] <_shaggy> ?
[15:08:56] <arschmitz> _shaggy: i mean i guess you could have your server access the cookies serialize them and add them to your ajax call
[15:09:07] <arschmitz> but you cant do it with javascript that would be the server
[15:09:28] <_shaggy> means no other way >?
[15:09:31] <arschmitz> no
[15:09:36] <arschmitz> this is basic browser security
[15:09:46] <_shaggy> Hmmm !!
[15:09:47] <arschmitz> you should not be able to do this
[15:10:03] <arschmitz> it would be a major security loophole if you could
[15:10:35] <_shaggy> i have my backend server(api) at http:/a and want to use those api to build a web app at http://b how would i manage my session ?
[15:10:55] <_shaggy> server allows CROS  !!
[15:11:32] <_shaggy> arschmitz still session management is impossible that means ?
[15:17:51] <cjohnson> Ownix: if you clone it, then you don't have to worry about the DOM because you're modifying the clone
[15:17:54] <cjohnson> which only exists in memory
[15:17:57] <cjohnson> not visually on the page
[15:18:23] <cjohnson> so you're fine to .remove stuff from your clone
[15:18:25] <Ownix> cjohnson: perfect
[15:18:32] <Ownix> That's what I wanted to know
[15:19:19] <bepolite> _shaggy: session or cookies? Those man different things
[15:32:19] <_shaggy> basically what i want is I wonna access the Set-Cookie header of an ajax response for an ajax request from http://a to http://b
[15:32:41] <_shaggy> bepolite  basically what i want is I wonna access the Set-Cookie header of an ajax response for an ajax request from http://a to http://b
[15:32:44] <_shaggy> is it possible
[15:32:46] <_shaggy> ?
[15:33:00] <_shaggy> means i can see that in web console
[15:33:40] <_shaggy> network  shows me but xhr.success:function(res, status, xhr) {   			 	alert(xhr.getResponseHeader("Set-Cookie")) } returns null
[15:33:49] <bepolite> yes
[15:33:55] <_shaggy> how ?>
[15:34:09] <bepolite> It is not possible
[15:34:10] <bepolite> <arschmitz> so you can never access cookies from http://b on http://a
[15:35:14] <_shaggy> there would be some way as many people do build web apps on apis !!
[15:36:15] <_shaggy> like web app http://www.housing.com is build using http://api.housing.com how would they handle most of cookie related stuff ?
[15:36:42] <arschmitz> _shaggy: well for one those are not completely different domains
[15:36:47] <arschmitz> thats very very different
[15:37:09] <arschmitz> for another you can build an app on an api with out having sharred cookies in the way you describe
[15:37:22] <_shaggy> how ?
[15:38:14] <arschmitz> _shaggy: which one?
[15:38:37] <_shaggy> basically how to share cookies across domains ?
[15:38:41] <_shaggy> not sub domains
[15:38:45] <arschmitz> you cant
[15:38:54] <arschmitz> thats what i keep telling you
[15:39:13] <arschmitz> this would be a major security issues for browsers this is never going to be possible
[15:39:43] <_shaggy> grrr u can do it atleast some way between servers !!
[15:39:55] <_shaggy> that too can help me  if possible
[15:40:02] <arschmitz> _shaggy: cookies are just information
[15:40:05] <_shaggy> http://www.codeguru.com/csharp/csharp/cs_internet/article.php/c19417/Sharing-Cookies-Across-Domains.htm
[15:40:07] <arschmitz> you can always pass information
[15:40:42] <arschmitz> _shaggy: using a server is very very different
[15:40:47] <_shaggy> means aint there some kind of framework or some configuration that can be doen between servers to share cookie !!
[15:41:08] <_shaggy> means i have an apache server and a gunicorn server can i share cookies between them !!
[15:41:32] <_shaggy> both are hosted on diffrent domains !
[15:41:45] <arschmitz> _shaggy: you will have to pass information between the servers basicly
[15:43:16] <arschmitz> you could follow the basic idea in the article you linked
[15:43:24] <arschmitz> just adapting for you language
[15:45:23] <arschmitz> _shaggy: also dont follow that if you need the info to not be passed raw in the url
[15:46:31] <_shaggy> grrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[15:49:52] <tomashe> Hey guys , i want to make an effect that for example i got a list of items (blocks) all invisible but as i scroll down they just fadein and the ones that not in the prespective is fading out ...

[15:50:48] <nikio___> hey
[15:50:55] <nikio___> how can i enable or disable a button?
[15:51:06] <nikio___> i mean
[15:51:13] <nikio___> the link its colour
[15:51:14] <arschmitz> $( "button" ).prop( "disabled" , true );
[15:51:17] <tomashe> let m esee
[15:51:31] <arschmitz> replace button with something more specific
[15:51:57] <nikio___> arschmitz, its a <a> element
[15:52:14] <nikio___> that links to something, i want it to be disabled or enabled depending on i there is a file present
[15:52:28] <tomashe> arschmitz: thanks
[15:52:28] <nikio___> if i click it and the file is there it should download
[15:52:39] <arschmitz> you cant really disable those you can use css to make something roughly the same
[15:52:55] <arschmitz> by changing colors and disabling pointer events
[15:52:56] <nikio___> if the file is not there, it should be grayed out and not link to anything
[15:53:20] <nikio___> arschmitz, ok how ? :)
[15:53:33] <kingfisher64> could some kind soul instruct me on how to get http://restaurant.drupalego.com/3d-restaurant-menu working like http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/3DRestaurantMenu/. I'm a jquery novice (although will be learned jquery properly after this).
[15:53:35] <kingfisher64> Checked load order and jquery library loads first then menu.js finally custom-script.js. I'm not sure what to do next? Many thanks
[15:54:11] <arschmitz> nikio___: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2091168/disable-a-link-using-css
[15:55:52] <nikio___> arschmitz, i cant do this in a portable way.. how can i achieve something that is portable
[15:55:58] <nikio___> maybe i should use something else
[15:59:11] <kingfisher64> clicking view the menu is effectively not doing anything.

[17:30:14] <lambdumb> you know how there's the various getHours/getMinutes etc. methods for retreiving time components from a unix timestamp, right?
[17:30:36] <lambdumb> is it possible to use them on a timestamp stored in a variable that isn't from jquery? like, a timestamp from an AJAX call
[17:34:20] <srikat> Hello all. Trying to replace an element 5 seconds after page load using jQuery. http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=6WP8v7g3 isn’t working as expected. Any ideas?
[17:35:39] <lambdumb> srikat, document onload
[17:35:50] <lambdumb> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[17:37:08] <srikat> thanks lamb. But “jQuery(function( $ ){“ is a shortform for “$( document ).ready()” in WordPress.
[17:37:18] <srikat> Please correct me if I am wrong.
[17:37:24] <lambdumb> oh, you're right
[17:38:42] <srikat> What is currently happening is that, page load is getting delayed by 5 seconds and the page appears with replaced content. http://polusdigital.com/macrocure/
[17:39:00] <srikat> The original content is “The Clinical Landscape Is Changing”.
[17:40:57] <shoky_> srikat: it's not, actually ;p
[17:41:52] <srikat> oh, I have other code wrapped inside “jQuery(function( $ ){“ and “});” and those are getting executed fine on page load.
[17:42:11] <srikat> http://polusdigital.com/macrocure/wp-content/themes/Macrocure/js/home.js?ver=1.0.0
[17:42:38] <shoky_> srikat: the original content is the same  <span class="to-be-replaced">Redefining Advanced Wound Care</span>
[17:43:35] <srikat> oops, silly me.
[17:45:06] <srikat> thanks lamb and shoky.
[17:48:11] <lambdumb> yw
[17:59:45] <srikat> wondering why fade out and fade in are not working.. http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Ypsby34U
[18:19:30] <Guddu_> If i want to change the dropdown based on selection of another dropdown then which event is the one to use? onChange?
[18:48:14] <adv_> how can i remove the first style class and replace it with foo?
[18:53:25] <adv_> 		$("#current-color:first").replaceWith(".btn-red2");
[18:53:25] <adv_>  ?
[18:53:46] <lambdumb> why does everyone use foo as placeholder in programming speak
[18:54:02] <tw2113> because bar makes us sound like alcoholics
[18:55:25] <rcyr> foo bar baz quux
[18:56:24] <adv_> hm
[18:56:58] <adv_> 		$("#current-color:first").removeClass($("#current-color:first")).addClass('.btn-red2');	
[18:57:05] <adv_> something more elegant?
[19:03:09] <adv_> doesn't work
[19:04:21] <adv_> i don't know what the class is called
[19:05:50] <adv_> i know it's the first one though
[19:16:32] <DragonPunch> $(document).on("drop", ".group-chatbox[data-groupboxid="+groupid+"]", FileDragHoverGroupChatBox);
[19:16:36] <DragonPunch> Does that look right??
[19:31:05] <DragonPunch> Anyone here?
[19:35:21] <fervent> how do I easily look up what the jquery methods look like in plan javascript?
[19:35:24] <fervent> plain
[19:36:13] <BillCriswell> fervent: The source is on github.
[19:37:17] <fervent> BillCriswell: Like the jquery file?
[19:37:42] <BillCriswell> fervent: https://github.com/jquery/jquery
[19:38:58] <fervent> BillCriswell: Nice, so how do I look up individual methods?
[19:40:14] <lambdumb> hm
[19:40:28] <BillCriswell> You can use the search at that url and look for like.. $.fn.someMethod
[19:40:30] <BillCriswell> I think.
[19:40:53] <lambdumb> is it possible to declare a function to run for multiple inputs? i'm making a function to pad 0s to 1 digit numbers and i wonder if there's a neat way to do it
[19:41:09] <lambdumb> like, pad 3 (or however many) variables and return them
[19:43:43] <BillCriswell> lambdumb: You can use like ('000000' + 4).slice(3) for "004"
[19:43:59] <BillCriswell> the amount of zeros can be dynamically set obviously
[19:44:28] <lambdumb> what does slice do?
[19:44:40] <lambdumb> truncate a variable?
[19:44:52] <BillCriswell> .js (new Array(3).join(0) + 5).slice(-3)
[19:45:07] <BillCriswell> it grabs a portion of a string
[19:45:10] <BillCriswell> .js > (new Array(3).join(0) + 5).slice(-3)
[19:45:24] <BillCriswell> js> (new Array(3).join(0) + 5).slice(-3)
[19:45:26] <b-ot> BillCriswell: No output.
[19:45:39] <BillCriswell> js> console.log((new Array(3).join(0) + 5).slice(-3))
[19:45:42] <b-ot> BillCriswell: No output.
[19:45:49] <BillCriswell> Well.. works in my console.
[19:46:10] <BillCriswell> js> print (new Array(3).join(0) + 5).slice(-3)
[19:46:13] <b-ot> BillCriswell: 005
[19:46:17] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[19:47:34] <lambdumb> so you're saying; put however many variables I want sliced into an array and run the slice function on the array and return them afterwards?
[19:48:49] <BillCriswell> sounds right.
[19:48:55] <BillCriswell> Sorry was drinking abit.
[19:48:58] <BillCriswell> >js var padded = function (r, n, f) { return (new Array(r).join(f || '0') + n).slice(-r); } padded(3, 23);
[19:49:34] <BillCriswell> This thing hates me
[19:52:28] <lambdumb> can you explain this function to me
[19:54:39] <BillCriswell> I repeat the padding r times and add n, I pad it with f, i get the last r characters of the string
[19:55:13] <lambdumb> so f might be "0" if we wanted to pad 0s
[19:55:24] <lambdumb> and r is an array of things to pad?
[19:56:13] <BillCriswell> r is just a character to repeat essentially
[19:56:41] <BillCriswell> or characters
[20:11:21] <adv_> https://jsfiddle.net/4qrLogbt/  if i click on a color from the palette, it changes the button color but if i click outside or on the button itself, it goes black . i want it to keep the last color applied

[22:40:20] <DragonPunch> im doing it uhkis
[22:40:24] <DragonPunch> can i show u a live example?
[22:41:38] <Uhkis> DragonPunch: of course
[22:41:51] <DragonPunch> scribear.com/test
[22:41:55] <DragonPunch> then go to scribear.com
[22:42:10] <DragonPunch> lmk when u are there
[22:43:37] <Uhkis> i'm there
[22:43:41] <Uhkis> now what
[22:43:46] <DragonPunch> okay
[22:43:46] <DragonPunch> so
[22:43:56] <DragonPunch> on the left click on teh 'cloud' so it shows you storage items
[22:43:56] <DragonPunch> okay
[22:44:05] <DragonPunch> so on the right under channels click on the first channel
[22:44:25] <DragonPunch> drag and drop a image make sure its an image from file storage into the group chat that pops open
[22:44:27] <DragonPunch> then hit X
[22:44:29] <DragonPunch> to close it
[22:44:35] <DragonPunch> open it back again and drag and drop it again
[22:44:40] <DragonPunch> now there is 2
[22:44:41] <DragonPunch> wth
[22:44:47] <DragonPunch> why is there 2
[22:46:31] <DragonPunch> see what i mean uhkis
[22:47:34] <Uhkis> you don't clear the contents of the chat on close
[22:48:18] <DragonPunch> what command would that be?
[22:49:15] <Uhkis> $(yourchatbox).html(''); for example
[22:50:00] <DragonPunch> not working
[22:50:17] <DragonPunch> http://hastebin.com/erojafeviy.coffee Uhkis
[22:51:25] <Uhkis> oh, your getfile gets called twice

[22:53:47] <cyberbrai> http://jsfiddle.net/2fr4y02h/2/     my function is not working on tbody
[22:56:18] <DragonPunch> Uhkis: if it helps you can refresh the page. open close the group window 4x then on the 5th time  drag drop the image. it will spawn 5 times.
[22:56:44] <DragonPunch> Uhkis: what I'm thinking is that after I call the remove(); on the element it's not completely removing it from the DOM?
[22:58:37] <Uhkis> FileSelectHandlerGroupChatBox gets called too many times
[22:59:37] <Uhkis> yeah, you rebind those drag/drop events on every click
[23:00:20] <DragonPunch> Uhkis? so on close you want me to kill those bindings?

[23:05:23] <Uhkis> 5-7 $(document).off("dragover", ".group-chatbox[data-groupboxid="+groupid+"]"); should be enough
[23:06:46] <DragonPunch> worked.
[23:06:48] <DragonPunch> !!

[23:21:43] <Cork> (except to help someone else getting to work)
[23:21:49] <Cork> unnu: just dandy
[23:23:15] <unnu> yo Cork, data attributes can i select them from a $('.classname') using $(this).attr('data-blah') ??
[23:23:56] <Cork> unnu: if it is data attributes (and not set through .data) you can select them with $('.classname[data-blah=""]')
[23:24:07] <Cork> (="" is optional if you don't care about the value)
[23:24:39] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/nokgc9gy/4/   the No Class at this Time button is giving me greif
[23:25:08] <unnu> i could either A, print them out with a bunch of php, or B, do it all in one line with jquery . . .  if i could only figure it out
[23:25:08] <unnu> lol
[23:25:17] <unnu> this working smart has me working hard
[23:25:30] <Uhkis> Cork: i bet my first site back in -96 had some <blinked> gif :D

[23:26:16] <unnu> <3
[23:26:20] <Cork> gah...
[23:26:25] <Cork> unnu: should be data()
[23:26:40] <DragonPunch> Uhkis: \o
[23:26:52] <DragonPunch> anyone got a nice file icon pack
[23:26:53] <Cork> Uhkis: min had animated night sky as the menu and header background :)
[23:26:58] <Cork> made it SUPER slow XD
[23:27:21] <unnu> Cork, still undefined :(
[23:27:44] <Cork> unnu: well the $(this) in line1 won't work
[23:27:55] <Uhkis> Cork: i tried some snowfall thing, my 200MHz pentium could not handle it :D
[23:27:58] <Cork> for one this is window os data-timev won't exist
[23:28:05] <Cork> *window so
[23:28:16] <Cork> Uhkis: ya, those where... special
[23:28:38] <Cork> but animated gifs could suck the life out of a computer too
[23:28:43] <Cork> (and still can actually)
[23:28:49] <unnotused> yeah
[23:28:52] <unnotused> take that unnu
[23:28:53] <unnotused> jerk
[23:29:13] <unnu> GAH i forgot my nickserv password
[23:29:19] <unnu> and it is programmed into my client
[23:29:24] <unnu> well poop
[23:30:12] <Uhkis> Cork: just scale a big picture and start css-animating it, no need for gifs ;-)
[23:30:20] <unnu> hey Cork, do you see what I am trying to do there on line 1?
[23:30:26] <Cork> Uhkis: ya, but that's even worse
[23:30:36] <Cork> unnu: no
[23:31:24] <unnu> :( i am trying to add a button to the end of each .btn-group div with a data attribute of the data attribute of the .btn-group i am appending
[23:32:06] <Cork> unnu: .append doesn't work like that
[23:32:19] <Cork> you're sending it a script, it isn't a function that is called fro each element
[23:32:43] <unnu> how do i wanna go about doing that for each element?
[23:32:52] <unnu> (that matches the selector)
[23:33:17] * unnu is trying to learn how to jquery :P
[23:34:25] <unnu> is there a foreach (selector) function or something like that?
[23:36:28] <Cork> so $(this) doesn't work
[23:36:28] <Cork> you could though :)
[23:36:29] <Cork> unnu: http://jsfiddle.net/nokgc9gy/6/
[23:36:51] <Cork> cleaned up a big http://jsfiddle.net/nokgc9gy/7/
[23:36:54] <Cork> *bit
[23:37:12] <unnu> Cork, You're a wizard
[23:37:23] <unnu> there is nothing that can convince me otherwise
[23:38:05] <unnu> is that the right way to  build html objects?   that is something i have been wanting to learn how to do correctly
[23:38:38] <Cork> i get a queazy feeling every time i see 'html' + random_variable + 'html'
[23:39:02] <Cork> reminds me too much about sql injections i guess
[23:39:29] <unnu> I just wanna learn how to do it the "recommended" way . . . how else will i get them leet skillz?
[23:39:52] <unnu> not a lot in the api about how to do it . . . mostly function reference
[23:39:56] <Cork> unnu: correct
[23:40:12] <Cork> unnu: and the api is about what the functions can do
[23:40:24] <Cork> and its quite well documented actually
[23:40:29] <unnu> absolutely
[23:40:52] <unnu> i just wanna tut or something showing "this is the prefered way to build html with JQ"
[23:40:53] <Cork> but ya, knowing where to look is a problem at the beginning
[23:41:11] <Cork> unnu: it isn't so much the jq way
[23:41:21] <unnu> real?
[23:41:23] <Cork> its just some things is bad from stability and security
[23:41:54] <unnu> well this code is saved in my "from Cork" folder now
[23:41:58] <unnu> so i will always have it <3
[23:42:24] <unnu> i feel bad because it's no where near the first thing ive put in it
[23:42:25] <Cork> for example .append('<div>' + $(this).val() + '</div>'); doesn't prevent the input from having <script>my evil javascript section</script>
[23:43:24] <Cork> unnu: well that is largely why I'm here if i can help ppl avoid pitfalls, its good :)
[23:43:33] <unnu> <3 u man
[23:43:36] <unnu> u rock
[23:44:04] <unnu> hopefully i can finish this web app before the client wants it tomorrow
[23:44:05] <unnu> :P
[23:44:18] <Cork> the other big part is that i get exposure to things i wouldn't otherwise so i get to try to solve problems i might experience in the future
[23:44:21] <unnu> ive been using more jquery and JS in my applications, trying to push myself to learn
[23:44:55] <Cork> unnu: using js is fine, but it should be the last step
[23:45:12] <Cork> meaning if possible things should be solved in html + css first
[23:45:25] <Cork> and then possibly added with some js for "better experience"
[23:45:32] <unnu> ive been trying mvc lately, with js doing all the interactions and ajax
[23:45:58] <Cork> well as long as it works without js too, its fine
[23:46:16] <unnu> most of what i write is web applications, which means html + css views for the most part, but like this example with the red buttons, its soooo much easier with js/jq
[23:46:23] <Cork> (and by work i mean the main parts of it, everything doesn't have to work)
[23:46:43] <Cork> ya
[23:48:38] <unnu> cloud9 is so slow tonight :(
[23:48:47] <Uhkis> unnu: you're in a really bad position
[23:50:26] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/nokgc9gy/7/ has the infamous label typo on line 2 btw
[23:51:26] <unnu> lol caught that Uhkis
[23:51:28] <unnu> ;)
