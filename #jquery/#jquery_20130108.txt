[00:06:00] <Whiskey> ($("#"+divid).substring(0,5) == "block") it tells me that substric not a function
[00:11:18] <Whiskey> jQuery refuese to use substring :/
[00:11:39] <sherlock-holmes> has anyone solved the issue with "tab" buutton within a textarea ?
[00:11:49] <sherlock-holmes> I have a solution for "tab"-only press
[00:11:53] <sherlock-holmes> but I need something for
[00:11:59] <sherlock-holmes> "shift+tab", means - backtab
[00:12:08] <sherlock-holmes> and I have this by now
[00:12:26] <sherlock-holmes> http://pastebin.com/ay2vyJee
[00:13:05] <_sCoRpi> Whiskey: substring is a method of a string, not of a jquery collection
[00:13:31] <Dervisevic> Hey everyone. I'm using JQM 1.2 and i have a listview, every listview item expands with a slidtoggle and contains some form elements. I'm experienceing heavy lag on iPhone(5, only tested on this) when expanding this. Is there anything i can do to improve this, or can't the hardware keep up?
[00:13:45] <Whiskey> _sCoRpi: but how do i do it then?
[00:13:59] <Whiskey> this is what i try to change "if (divid.substring(0,5) == "block") {"
[00:14:00] <_sCoRpi> Whiskey: i have no idea what you even wanted to do with that command
[00:14:24] <_sCoRpi> so what the hell does that have to do with jquery?
[00:14:44] <Whiskey> o just think it was nicer :(
[00:14:51] <Whiskey> and a way to lurn a bit maybe
[00:14:53] <_sCoRpi> O_o
[00:15:29] <sherlock-holmes> dervisevic's bosnian
[00:15:29] <sherlock-holmes> :D
[00:16:22] <Dervisevic> Hah, yeah, was born there, moved to sweden when i was 4, 24 now!
[00:16:26] <Whiskey> anyways how do i get jQuery to do it as it refuse everything i try
[00:17:21] <sherlock-holmes> you're like Zlatan Ibrahimovic
[00:17:50] <Dervisevic> Yeah, he's totally my homeboy :)
[00:18:56] <sherlock-holmes> yea
[00:19:01] <sherlock-holmes> we use same names as well
[00:19:01] <sherlock-holmes> :D
[00:19:09] <sherlock-holmes> me and ibrahimovic :P
[00:19:24] <Dervisevic> hehe
[00:23:44] <xec> Whiskey: what are you trying to do? check the first letters of the text content of an element? tried .text()?
[00:26:49] <Whiskey> naaa xec :)
[00:27:00] <Whiskey> Im don´t but its not working 100%
[00:27:18] <xec> what? you are do not?
[00:27:40] * xec is confuzzled
[00:27:52] <Dervisevic> Looks like the solution to laggy animations is to use CSS3 animations instead
[00:28:01] <xec> css <3
[00:28:33] <xec> <3 is the emoticon for 'balls' right? as in css is balls?
[00:28:34] <Whiskey> http://pastebin.nukenet.se/1008/ <-- that was what i try to do xec
[00:29:23] <Dervisevic> It's the balls
[00:29:43] <xec> :D
[00:30:35] <xec> Whiskey: line 8 is just checking to see if the divid string starts with "block". i suggest you keep it as-is, no need for jquery
[00:30:39] <seutje> Whiskey: if ($("#"+divid.substring(0,5)) == "block") <- think u forgot a .css('display') there
[00:31:04] <xec> seutje: i don't think so, see the original at line 8
[00:31:15] <seutje> cause as-is, that comparison will never be true
[00:31:31] <seutje> comparing a jQuery collection to a string
[00:31:44] <seutje> original compares a string to a string
[00:31:57] <Whiskey> No that line has noting to do whit css seutje
[00:32:11] <xec> seutje: it checks the input string, not the display type
[00:32:16] <Whiskey> But the 2 lines under that change the html Save: and "Link" not working
[00:32:35] <seutje> but it just grabs a element with that ID and compares it to a string
[00:32:42] <seutje> how would that ever work?
[00:32:53] <Cork> it won't
[00:32:59] <xec> it wouldn't
[00:33:09] * xec highfives Cork
[00:33:20] <Cork> "[HTML Element]" == "block" is what it will check
[00:33:25] <seutje> but yeah, if ur code is the same size when using jquery, you probably shouldn't be using it
[00:33:38] <morteza> hi
[00:33:43] <xec> hi morteza!!
[00:33:44] <Whiskey> yeh i now
[00:34:04] <morteza> how fetch checkboxes:checked list without for/loop
[00:34:21] <morteza> without somethings like each or map
[00:34:33] <xec> ?xy @ morteza
[00:34:34] <bot-t> morteza, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[00:35:11] <Cork> Whiskey: and that jquery'fied code could be shortend quite a bit
[00:35:14] <morteza> xec: I wanna list of checkboxes:checked id without using each or map
[00:35:29] <xec> morteza: sry for making the bot spam you so early, i just meant to say that it would be nice to know what you're trying to do. what do you mean by list? a jquery collection?
[00:35:36] <seutje> why?
[00:36:04] <Dervisevic> xec: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1iaczvycj1rqfhi2o1_500.gif
[00:36:29] <morteza> xec: means json
[00:36:31] <seutje> morteza: how about a vanilla for loop? :D
[00:36:35] <Christer> How can i return the last object of an array ? data.reports.length-1 just gives me undefined.
[00:36:43] <xec> Dervisevic: http://condycommunications.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/95-Internet-High-Five.jpg
[00:37:35] <Cork> data.reports[data.reports.length-1] should work IF its really an array
[00:38:02] <seutje> smells a lot like json
[00:38:03] <Cork> Christer: if its really an object you can't return last cause there is no order for them
[00:38:25] <seutje> sorta like PHP arrays :P
[00:38:27] <Christer> crap
[00:38:42] <xec> morteza: i don't know any way you could do that without some sort of loop
[00:38:55] <morteza> xec: ok . thanks
[00:38:56] <Cork> Christer: so you need to provide what the array/object looks like
[00:40:38] <Christer> Cork: http://i47.tinypic.com/2ibjcht.png
[00:40:59] <Cork> ok, then ya thats an object of objects not an array
[00:41:08] <Cork> array can't have numbers out of order
[00:41:28] <Cork> (0,1,2 not 1,3,8)
[00:43:28] <Christer> ok so just creating a foreach loop would work i guess.
[00:44:00] <Cork> don't forget to check hasOwnProperty
[00:44:16] <Cork> ?mdc hasOwnProperty
[00:44:19] <bot-t> Cork, hasOwnProperty - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty
[00:44:30] <Cork> Christer: else you might loop generic object functions
[00:45:10] <tw2113> i'm horrible, Cork
[00:45:11] <Cork> Christer: alternatively you can use jquery $.each
[00:45:26] <Cork> ?jquery.each
[00:45:27] <bot-t> jQuery.each(collection, callback): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[00:45:32] <Christer> basicly the same thing im doing
[00:45:39] <Christer> (index in data.reports)
[00:45:55] <Cork> Christer: no that will loop generic members
[00:46:46] <Christer> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/gb9ch/
[00:47:28] <dirkpennings> somebody knows a swiping star rating plugin for mobile?
[00:47:31] <Christer> that will loop trough it and whenever the loop finishes then the latest object will be stored in latestReport.
[00:47:36] <Cork> ?eval Object.property[10] = 1; var test = {1:'a', 2:'b'}; var keys = '' for(index in test) { keys += index; }; print keys;
[00:47:40] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[00:47:43] <tw2113> Cork, i spent probably 45 minutes creating some plot arrays for a graphing lib, based on my student loans
[00:48:04] <Cork> Christer: for will loop things on prototype too
[00:48:14] <Cork> Christer: so you need to check hasOwnProperty
[00:48:14] <Christer> aha
[00:48:41] <Cork> ?eval Object.prototype[10] = 1; var test = {1:'a', 2:'b'}; var keys = '' for(index in test) { keys += ' ' + index; }; print keys;
[00:48:42] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[00:48:45] <Cork> bah
[00:48:46] <dirkpennings> like the itunes rating system
[00:49:06] <Cork> Christer: or use $.each (it does it already)
[00:49:15] <Christer> ok thanks :)
[00:49:43] <Cork> tw2113: ok?
[00:49:49] <tw2113> i got bored :D
[00:49:53] <Cork> heh
[00:49:55] <tw2113> and wanted some visuals for my progress
[00:50:15] <tw2113> line graph it is!
[00:50:41] <Cork> ?eval Object.prototype[10] = 1; var test = {1:'a', 2:'b'}; var keys = ''; for(index in test) { keys += ' ' + index; }; print keys;
[00:50:42] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[00:50:47] * Cork kicks bot-t 
[00:52:32] <Cork> hmm
[00:52:35] <Cork> ?eval Object.prototype[10] = 1; var test = {1:'a', 2:'b'}; var keys = ''; for(index in test) { keys += ' ' + index; }; keys;
[00:52:36] <bot-t> Cork: " 1 2 10"
[00:52:42] <tw2113> bed time
[00:52:54] <Cork> ah its the #javascript channels bot that supports print :/
[00:57:35] <xec> Cork: i think it's a function, so print(keys);
[00:57:50] <Cork> ?eval Object.prototype[10] = 1; var test = {1:'a', 2:'b'}; var keys = ''; for(index in test) { keys += ' ' + index; }; print(keys);
[00:57:51] <bot-t> Cork: " 1 2 10"
[00:57:55] <Cork> so it is :)
[00:57:59] <xec> yay :D
[01:01:58] <goddard> will serialize() with a form only select checked input check boxes?
[01:02:06] <Cork> yes
[01:02:14] <mansoor-s> \o
[01:02:23] <mansoor-s> o/
[01:02:27] <xec> \o/

[01:18:26] <bed777> any hints? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14211642/no-details-error-on-ajax-request-crossdomain
[01:20:13] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/e8u8s/38/ whats wrong in that jQuery i try to inclue the firstscript in "<div class="infoViewBox">" only
[01:24:03] <Clex> Whiskey: you're not using jQuery everywhere.
[01:24:33] <bed777> any idee?
[01:24:36] <mazzachre> Anyone else have had a problem where IE8 returns the value 3.999 as result from 480/120 ? (All are read values, so it is probably a rounding error somewhere...)
[01:24:39] <bed777> I don't know why the request is not starting.
[01:24:40] <bed777> any hints? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14211642/no-details-error-on-ajax-request-crossdomain
[01:25:43] <Whiskey> Clex: what do you mean?
[01:27:35] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/e8u8s/39/ <-- Cex: that works but then it apply to all tables
[01:29:13] * ul71m0 says hi
[01:30:55] <ul71m0> im using this plugin http://www.zurb.com/playground/jquery_image_slider_plugin for rotating testimonials on my site, and as on demo when all slides pass it stops, i see in plugin parameters there is afterSlideChange: function(){} 	 // empty function but dunno what rly to put there so my sliding will be continious
[01:42:19] <Whiskey> i really don´t understand jQuery
[01:42:20] <codecowboy> Any jQuery gurus got any thoughts on this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14209761/do-mobile-webkit-browsers-have-a-rounding-issue-in-js
[01:49:46] <mansoor-s> codecowboy, but we have no thoughts

[01:57:49] <marcules> hi there
[01:58:13] <mansoor-s> marcules, hi. did you pay the entrance fee?
[01:58:43] <marcules> I did no such thing, why do you ask?
[02:00:04] <mansoor-s> marcules, freeloader <_<
[02:01:10] <marcules> ^^
[02:03:58] <bahamas> hello. is there any reason to use a selector constantly instead of using it once and saving it to a variable? I mean using $('#button') all the time, instead of var button = $('#button');
[02:04:47] <Cork> bahamas: you shouldn't use a selector over and over again
[02:04:56] <Cork> only if you expect the element to be replaced
[02:05:34] <Cork> that said, id selectors isn't to bad cause it more or less a pure dom function call
[02:05:41] <Cork> *too bad
[02:06:05] <Cork> (and that function call is a pure has lookup)
[02:06:40] <bahamas> Cork: yeah, that's what I thought (the first part, I mean)
[02:06:59] <bahamas> thanks
[02:07:03] <Cork> np
[02:10:35] <rudraram> how to add auto rotating to tabbed content?
[02:10:58] <Cork> auto rotating?
[02:11:27] <rudraram> cork: yes thats right
[02:11:44] <Cork> rudraram: you need to elaborate on what you mean
[02:15:19] <NodeX> 42
[02:24:45] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/e8u8s/40/ if you open that box you see show, you see the last row on the table 12: gets multiline :) i need to expand the table to full width insted of break the line
[02:27:29] <rudraram> cork: did you see that?
[02:28:41] <rudraram> http://djs-music.com/
[02:29:42] <rudraram> Cork: http://djs-music.com/
[02:33:31] <Cork> rudraram: what about it?
[02:34:47] <rudraram> cork: you see the dynamic tabbed content in the middle of the page?
[02:35:15] <Cork> so by rotate you mean the shifting of tabs?
[02:35:32] <Cork> or what?
[02:35:53] <rudraram> cork: exactly. sorry for the confusion
[02:36:47] <Cork> rudraram: what extension are you using for that?
[02:37:00] <Cork> sorry plugin
[02:37:52] <rudraram> cork: I'm pretty confused what to you for that?
[02:38:25] <Cork> rudraram: tabs('rotate') isn't a standard feature of jquery ui as far as i know
[02:39:13] <rudraram> cork: ok what can I do to get it work?
[02:39:31] <Cork> rudraram: get it working?
[02:39:39] <Cork> if it is what i though it was it is working
[02:39:50] <Cork> else you need to explain what it is that isn't working
[02:40:21] <rudraram> cork: sorry again cork but that was the example which I gave you
[02:40:33] <Cork> no thats a page
[02:40:44] <Cork> its not an examination of what to look for
[02:40:55] <Cork> and what you want
[02:45:15] <mansoor-s> ಠ_ಠ
[03:03:04] <rudraram> cork:  i want thesame functionality on http://etailbrand.co.uk
[03:08:10] <Cork> ah
[03:12:35] <Cork> rudraram: they're using some form of plugin for jquery ui, not sure what though
[03:13:27] <Cork> rudraram: you could try http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1268732/jquery-ui-rotating-tabs-events
[03:15:53] <Whiskey> take that as a no then

[03:31:12] <Kasimir> codecowboy have you tried it on a actual mobile phone
[03:31:21] <codecowboy> Kasimir, YES
[03:32:25] <codecowboy> Kasimir, the entire issue is mobile specific
[03:33:30] <Kasimir> hmm, works the same way on my iphone :S
[03:36:12] <t432> looking for the function that listens for input in textfiled and submits once upon "enter" key
[03:36:56] <codecowboy> Kasimir, what do you mean 'the same way'? can you be more specific?
[03:38:05] <t432> anyone?
[03:41:06] <Cork> t432: submit and a form around the field
[03:41:36] <Kasimir> codecowboy: not sure whats wrong with it
[03:41:53] <Kasimir> codecowboy: might not just get what you mean
[03:42:35] <t432> Cork: how about the change()?
[03:42:48] <Cork> t432: it triggers on blur
[03:43:01] <Cork> (if i remember correctly)
[03:43:39] <t432> I need something when I type into the textfield I press return, ajax post callback is triggered
[03:44:08] <Cork> t432: what you should do is <form><input></form>
[03:44:33] <t432> and?
[03:44:51] <Cork> $('form').submit(function() { /* ajax call */ });
[03:45:08] <t432> so ... return key will be treated as "submit"?
[03:45:23] <Cork> yes
[03:45:26] <t432> i see
[03:45:31] <Cork> IF its inside a form
[03:45:39] <t432> ofcourse
[03:46:00] <Cork> what i meant is submit on the input field doesn't work
[03:46:49] <t432> Cork: what if I have 2 fields that depend on each other .e.g "password" and "password confirm", which should only submit if both fields have value and match?
[03:47:04] <NodeX> Unless it's hit inside a <textarea> of course ;)
[03:47:06] <Cork> validate them in the submit event
[03:47:13] <Cork> NodeX: true
[03:55:09] <sherlock-holmes> anyone has expirence with textarea tab issues?
[03:56:26] <sherlock-holmes> ??
[04:02:58] <motka> urloment.com -- is an ad-free no-captcha "pastebin-like" service
[04:10:42] <t432> Cork: is there anyway way to distinguish which element triggered the submit()?
[04:10:55] <Cork> no
[04:11:47] <t432> the i'd need submission on element not form but that is the possible, right?
[04:11:51] <t432> then*
[04:12:30] <Cork> it is possible but it will be a bit buggy depending on what the browser normally does
[04:12:46] <Cork> you can use keypress and check the keycode == 13
[04:13:09] <t432> i need something stable not "buggy"
[04:13:30] <Cork> it is stable, but you will get missing and none normal behaviors
[04:13:47] <Cork> cause what happens in submit is browser specific
[04:14:43] <t432> not sure if "missing and none normal behaviour" can be termed as stable.
[04:15:30] <Cork> well its the same kind of stable behavior you get if you style form elements
[04:16:04] <Cork> that said why do you know what field triggered it?
[04:16:19] <Cork> why can't you just send both?
[04:17:50] <t432> because I need to validate
[04:18:15] <t432> i guess I can check if the field is null ...if not then validate
[04:18:28] <Cork> you mean you need to server validate?
[04:18:51] <t432> not server side, that would occure on submission
[04:18:54] <t432> client side
[04:19:03] <Cork> just validate all of them
[04:19:24] <t432> some field can be null and other not
[04:19:26] <Cork> i would expect to get validation error if a needed field isn't filled if i submit a form
[04:19:30] <Cork> so?
[04:20:07] <t432> i see
[04:20:12] <DrDank> Is the learning curve bad.. compared to regular javascript? (the jquery scripting.)
[04:20:13] <Cork> going over all fields and validate all of them depending on the other fields (of needed) isn't heavy
[04:20:19] <Cork> so just do it every time
[04:20:26] <t432> yeah
[04:20:38] <Cork> DrDank: no jquery is easier
[04:21:05] <Cork> though i think a basic understanding of how the pure dom works and of javascripts is needed before you start with jquery
[04:21:26] <Cork> else you will paint you're self into a corner very fast
[04:21:45] <Cork> DrDank: jquery is just a framework, not a different language
[04:22:00] <Cork> DrDank: think of it as a set of helpers to make normal js easier to write

The thing is that I get some strange behavior! behing data the object of the ajax answer if I put ($(data).filter("#main")).html() it works fine but then is I use ($(data).filter("#js")).html() #js returns only part of the answer. the div js only contains js imports. but if I do a console log of data is h
[04:41:56] <marcomartins> as all the content!
[04:46:00] <wolfehr> is there a functional difference between $('document').foo() and $(document).foo() ?
[04:46:13] <marcomartins> other thing is that if I do on the console html; (I have on my code html = data) it prints all the page including the js, but if I do $(html) it prints only the html

[04:53:51] <wolfehr> greengriminal: You haven't initialised the dialog at the point where you are exectuing that code
[04:54:44] <wolfehr> greengriminal: ensure you've got a $('foo').dialog() in a $(function(){} block
[04:55:46] <resurge> Hey, Is it possible that event handlers can't be added in this way?
[04:55:46] <resurge> $('.className', e.target).on('click', clickCallback);
[04:55:46] <resurge> Namely the part where I use 'e.target' to search within that element. (without using e.target the event is attached)
[04:57:13] <greengriminal> wolfehr: I've done that: https://gist.github.com/4483535
[04:57:37] <greengriminal> wolfehr: Would the above not be correct?
[04:58:01] <Cork> resurge: user $(this)
[04:58:36] <Cork> resurge: and yes e.target isn't inherited if you don't define the function inline
[04:59:07] <resurge> Cork: instead of e.target then?
[04:59:24] <Cork> well this would be the .className element
[04:59:42] <Cork> you can't get e.target in a function defined elsewhere
[05:00:03] <marcomartins> question: I have an ajax answer called data. I have html = data. if I print html I get all the content inside the divs, but if I print $(html) the div that I want the content (#js) don't have anything inside that is only js and imports of js
[05:00:21] <wolfehr> greengriminal, you have an error somewhere else then
[05:00:44] <Cork> marcomartins: you mean you have script tags in the html and you want to grab them?
[05:01:00] <wolfehr> greengriminal, pastebin the table and also the exact javascript, your error should become apparent then
[05:01:01] <resurge> Cork: Ah, this is only a part of the code, it's wrapped in a function where I do have access to the 'e' variable. And also e.target.
[05:01:08] <marcomartins> yes, tags and also some imports from js files
[05:01:23] <Cork> resurge: the it should work just fine
[05:01:43] <Cork> resurge: please provide a working example
[05:02:01] <Cork> marcomartins: when you parse html with jquery it will extract and remove script elements
[05:02:07] <Cork> and add them to the document header
[05:02:39] <marcomartins> Cork: What I don't understand is that some js's are in the object
[05:02:59] <Cork> marcomartins: if there is then its not working scripts
[05:03:09] <Cork> *if its there, then its not
[05:03:52] <marcomartins> Cork: for eg the import of bootstrap appears
[05:04:24] <marcomartins> Cork: so, how can I do that? I need that js to the specific page
[05:04:42] <Cork> marcomartins: all i can say is that jquery has explicit code that search for <script> tags and removes them from the string before parsing it
[05:05:16] <marcomartins> so, there is no way to extract the js to append on an html element?
[05:05:18] <Cork> marcomartins: the js would be executed in head, so unless its written obstructively, it should just work
[05:05:42] <Cork> marcomartins: you should never append js to the body, cause if you move that element it will be executed again
[05:06:24] <marcomartins> so, here do you recommend to put it?
[05:06:31] <Cork> in head
[05:06:41] <greengriminal> wolfehr: Basically i've identified that i need to some how find a the correct dialog that corresponds to the <td> that wass clicked, data attributes is one option.
[05:06:42] <resurge> Cork: example (working + what i expected to work but doesn't): http://jsfiddle.net/m6rK3/
[05:06:47] <Cork> $(document.head).html('<script></script>')
[05:07:46] <greengriminal> wolfehr: my experience with js isn't very good, but have come up with something like the following: https://gist.github.com/4483683
[05:08:25] <wolfehr> greengriminal: or they could share a class, or you could append the id of it like dialog_123 and add opendialog_123, then split the number out if the id to get a reference
[05:08:34] <marcomartins> Cork: the $(document.head).html('<script></script>') is for me?
[05:08:48] <Cork> resurge: does $(e.target).find('.t-grid-delete') give the same effect?
[05:08:55] <Cork> marcomartins: yes
[05:08:58] <Cork> opps no
[05:09:05] <Cork> its wrong, but it was for you :)
[05:09:14] <resurge> Cork: Yes, doesn't attach anything either
[05:09:21] <Cork> $(document.head).append('<script></script>') is the correct one ^^'
[05:09:28] <marcomartins> Cork: so always put js on the head :)
[05:09:34] <Cork> yes
[05:10:00] <Cork> resurge: hmm and e.target is the parent of t-grid-delete?
[05:10:00] <marcomartins> Cork: I thought that the best was on the footer to load only when the page ends loading
[05:10:22] <Cork> marcomartins: we're not talking about statically added script tags
[05:10:33] <Cork> but yes at the end of body is fine too if you add them statically
[05:10:45] <Cork> dynamically should always be in head
[05:10:45] <greengriminal> wolfehr: you mentioned that I should pastebin my table. My table is a .html.erb file which is a ruby on rails scripting file - https://gist.github.com/4483549
[05:11:31] <greengriminal> wolfehr: taking on board your suggetion would doing data-attributes be better than some substring hacking?
[05:11:32] <resurge> Cork: Yes, but there might not be an element with that classname yet when the events are being attached (which shouldn't be a problem since i'm using .on(), right?)
[05:11:36] <wolfehr> I always wonder about thes templating engines…… separation of logic and display code never seems to be maintained
[05:11:47] <Cork> resurge: wrong
[05:11:54] <marcomartins> the thing is that the js I want to append is in a full html page, so the extraction don't work I need to add it manually
[05:12:04] <Cork> resurge: you want $(e.target).on('click', '.t-grid-delete', function)
[05:12:04] <marcomartins> right?
[05:13:04] <Cork> marcomartins: if you append the html to the page it should just work, unless the js depends on old dom1 methods (ex. document.write)
[05:13:25] <marcomartins> no it don't :)
[05:13:36] <Cork> then just append the html
[05:13:48] <Cork> jquery will execute you're js when it finds it
[05:14:06] <Cork> resurge: $() always have to exist when you run .on
[05:14:30] <Cork> resurge: its the selector that you can give as the second argument to on that doesn't have to exist
[05:16:13] <resurge> Cork: that does work, but this event should be on the element with that class specifically since it needs to overwrite the click event. (this method places the event on the grid itself, and that event gets triggered after the original event)
[05:16:13] <resurge> So what happens is that both the original event gets called and the new one afterwards.
[05:16:13] <resurge> Also the reason why I'm calling "x.preventDefault();", which is the default event on that thing. (this is a telerik grid)
[05:16:50] <Cork> resurge: the event is delegated to the grid yes
[05:16:59] <Cork> but it will act on the element that the class matches
[05:17:03] <Cork> this will be the class element
[05:17:16] <Cork> and event.preventDefault will work for that class element
[05:17:49] <Cork> resurge: but thats the only way you can do it, else you have to wait for the element to be in dom if you have to add the event listener directly on the element
[05:18:06] <Cork> cause you can't add an event listener to a dom element that doesn't exist
[05:19:37] <seutje> but what about off-DOM DOM elements? :P
[05:20:05] <Cork> there isn't actually any off dom
[05:20:10] <resurge> Cork: Well it doesn't prevent the default though :/ Thanks for the help, but I'll have to look for an alternative method I guess.
[05:20:23] <Cork> all elements are on a dom, just not the dom connected to the rendering
[05:20:45] <Cork> resurge: it should prevent the default
[05:26:17] <coderhut_> hello. its a newbie question. please have a look at this coffee script code using jquery and suggest me any other or better option to access meta value. http://pastie.org/5647950
[05:27:19] <Cork> coderhut_: whats pageHtml?
[05:27:42] <Cork> the response from an ajax request?
[05:29:48] <coderhut_> Cork: yes you are right. it contaings whole page html
[05:29:53] <coderhut_> contains
[05:30:24] <Cork> codelahoma: that will be tricky
[05:30:44] <Cork> you're sure the find finds anything?
[05:31:02] <Cork> whats pageHtml.find('meta[itemprop=ratingValue]').length ?
[05:31:31] <coderhut_> when i run this code in firebug using just jquery then it returns the value
[05:31:42] <coderhut_> let me find the length if it returns
[05:32:58] <coderhut_> Cork: well it returns 0 in coffeescript
[05:33:38] <Cork> coderhut_: and you're sure the pageHtml has been filled?
[05:33:56] <Cork> if yes, then you can't use dom to find the meta tag
[05:34:04] <Cork> you have to use regex
[05:34:08] <coderhut_> yes as i am able to fetch other elements like div and spans etc but this meta is causig problem
[05:34:18] <coderhut_> hmmm
[05:34:20] <Cork> ya, the difference is that its in body
[05:34:27] <Cork> header isn't valid in fragments
[05:34:33] <Cork> so its dropped when its parsed
[05:34:46] <Cork> (only the content of body and down is valid)
[05:34:46] <coderhut_> i see
[05:35:46] <coderhut_> Cork: well it is the part of body's html rather in head of page's html.
[05:35:53] <coderhut_> should i try regex option then?
[05:36:01] <Cork> beta isn't valid in body
[05:36:05] <Cork> *meta
[05:36:22] <Cork> so ya regex is you're best bet
[05:36:40] <coderhut_> Cork: ahaan....ok got it then...thanks a lot for this
[05:36:52] <Cork> coderhut_: are you the one adding the data?
[05:37:02] <coderhut_> no scraping
[05:37:08] <Cork> if yes, you could prob solve it in a better way
[05:37:23] <Cork> as the generated html is invalid :/
[05:37:27] <Cork> ok
[05:37:27] <coderhut_> i am scrapping it from anothe website
[05:37:40] <Cork> ah
[05:37:51] <Cork> then it is you :)
[05:38:09] <Cork> if you could parse and modify it server side it would make it much better
[05:38:32] <coderhut_> :D thanks a lot for help. now i will find the regex option to solve
[05:38:35] <Cork> something like <span data-meta-content=""> or something
[05:38:48] <coderhut_> hmmm i think thats not possible
[05:39:36] <Cork> something like string.match(/<meta [^>]+>/) should get you going
[05:40:43] <Cork> or string.match(/<meta content="([^"]+)" itemprop="([^"]+)">/) if you want to be more specific
[05:40:50] <Cork> opps
[05:41:00] <Cork> * string.match(/<meta [^>]+>/g)
[05:41:08] <Cork> * string.match(/<meta content="([^"]+)" itemprop="([^"]+)">/g)
[05:42:13] <coderhut_> Cork: Thanks a lot once again.. i will follow these lines to resolve
[05:42:28] <shesek> a mere glimpse of the world of reg​ex parsers for HTML will ins​tantly transport a programmer's consciousness into a world of ceaseless screaming, he comes, the pestilent slithy regex-infection wil​l devour your HT​ML parser, application and existence for all time like Visual Basic only worse he comes he comes
[05:42:54] <Cork> shesek: ya
[05:43:17] <Cork> shesek: but there is little options when you want access to invalid html elements
[05:43:35] <shesek> there are plenty of HTML parsers that manage to get a tree out of invalid HTML browsers
[05:43:45] <shesek> blah, s/browsers/syntax
[05:44:08] <Cork> shesek: get a tree sure, preserving elements that shouldn't be there to start with, is another matter
[05:44:41] <shesek> well, coderhut_, where are you getting that HTML from?
[05:45:25] <shesek> if the browser itself can't even parse it properly... where is it used
[05:45:25] <shesek> ?
[05:45:55] <Cork> shesek: its a string from an ajax call
[05:46:00] <marcules> hmmm wouldn't this be "neat" for code obfuscation? ^^
[05:46:20] <shesek> $('<meta content="4.5016095" itemprop="ratingValue">').filter('meta[itemprop=ratingValue]').attr('content')
[05:46:20] <shesek> "4.5016095"
[05:46:23] <shesek> works for me...
[05:46:45] <coderhut_> shesek: here is an example url http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/rowi/304c9bfd-9b65-e011-81d2-78e7d1fa76f8
[05:47:16] <shesek> coderhut_, please find another way. dear lord help us how can anyone survive this scourge using regex to parse HTML has doomed humanity to an eternity of dread torture and security holes using regex as a tool to process HTML establishes a breach between this world and the dread realm of c͒ͪo͛ͫrrupt entities.
[05:47:29] * Cork cries
[05:47:35] <shesek> do you want to doom humanity to an eternity of dread torture?
[05:47:47] <cuddle`> hello, I have a weird problem, I have this piece of code: http://jsbin.com/acasut/1/edit . which works fine on jsbin. But it won't work in jquerymobile :S
[05:47:57] <cuddle`> it worked once, but it stopped working somehow
[05:48:23] <shesek> dafuq does it have a <meta> tag in the middle of the document? oO
[05:48:28] <coderhut_> shesek: i would like to first use regex for simple words to understand your philisphical language :D appologies
[05:48:49] <coderhut_> shesek: yes
[05:48:54] <shesek> coderhut_, it still works for me, tho
[05:49:12] <shesek> $('meta[itemprop=ratingValue]')
[05:49:12] <shesek> [
[05:49:12] <shesek> <meta itemprop=​"ratingValue" content=​"4.5016095">​
[05:49:12] <shesek> ]
[05:49:27] <shesek> (from Chrome developer tools console, in the URL you provided)
[05:49:30] <cuddle`> doesn't give any bugs at all
[05:49:33] <cuddle`> everything else works fine
[05:49:41] <Cork> shesek: the parser that runs when the browser loads is more forgiving then the one you can use from js
[05:49:44] <cuddle`> it's just that these .on event handlers won't respond
[05:49:51] <Cork> it will actually move things around to make it work
[05:50:45] <shesek> $('<html><body><div><i><b></i><p><sdfsdf><meta content="4.5016095" itemprop="ratingValue"></body>').find('meta[itemprop=ratingValue]').attr('content')
[05:50:45] <shesek> "4.5016095"
[05:51:15] <Cork> interesting
[05:51:24] <shesek> You can use the same parser that the browser uses to render the page from JS
[05:51:35] <shesek> that's what stuffing stuff into innerHTML uses
[05:51:41] <Cork> shesek: ya, but you don't get the pre processor
[05:51:44] <shesek> (which is what $() does when given an HTML string)
[05:52:40] <Cork> there are a few compatibility hacks that browsers run to be compatible with old ie browsers
[05:52:47] <Cork> that only run on page load
[05:53:07] <shesek> well, that might be true, but it doesn't seem like the case here
[05:53:14] <Cork> ya
[05:53:54] <Cork> (that doesn't mean thats a horrible idea anyway)
[06:03:52] <murr4y> hi! is a selector, when done twice on the *same* DOM, always guaranteed to return the objects in the same order?
[06:05:47] <Cork> murr4y: yes
[06:05:57] <Cork> unless you move them that is
[06:07:32] <murr4y> ok - move them how, do you mean?
[06:07:41] <murr4y> in the DOM?
[06:07:47] <Cork> yes
[06:07:51] <murr4y> okay
[06:07:53] <murr4y> thank you
[06:08:54] <[jmc]> hello
[06:11:33] <[jmc]> is there any guide on how to extend jquery ui to create some custom widget?
[06:18:47] <shimas> hi
[06:19:05] <shimas> is there a way to animate non-css properties?
[06:20:26] <tlkr> such as what shimas ?
[06:21:19] <shimas> <circle r="69"...
[06:21:29] <shimas> i want to animate the r-attribute
[06:22:51] <tlkr> I'm not entirely sure but I imagine you would have to use apply logic to the r attribute based on its current value rather than using jQuery's .animate() function
[06:23:57] <shimas> :/
[06:27:14] <mazzachre> Is it possible to set opacity on an object runtime in IE8? (It lags the opacity css option)
[06:27:29] <kerozene> shimas: you could try greensock
[06:27:47] <[jmc]> mazzachre: see the non-standard "filter" property
[06:28:22] <[jmc]> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms530752(VS.85).aspx
[06:28:44] <[jmc]> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533035(v=vs.85).aspx
[06:29:09] <[jmc]> well, actually, mazzachre: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms532967(v=vs.85).aspx
[06:30:58] <kerozene> shimas: actually there's some documentation of that with greensock and raphaeljs
[06:31:57] <mazzachre> [jmc]: Can I set that via jQuery? as in $('...').css('-ms-filter', 'progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha(opacity=60)');
[06:32:26] <[jmc]> mazzachre: I actually have never tried that from jQuery
[06:32:48] <[jmc]> but I bet it's possible, or maybe directly from element.style["filter"] = "something";l
[06:33:08] <NodeX> you can use prop aswell and set it inline
[06:33:20] <NodeX> prop('style','.....'
[06:33:28] <daedeloth> jquery ui. what is it good for?
[06:33:42] <kerozene> daedeloth: its datepicker
[06:33:57] <[jmc]> kerozene: lol
[06:33:59] <NodeX> bloating out your code!
[06:34:17] <daedeloth> yes. But without the basic widgets, what is it's point? it's far from complete to build an application with
[06:34:17] <NodeX> and bad kids that are to lazy to write the code themselves
[06:34:38] <[jmc]> daedeloth: extend it!
[06:34:46] <[jmc]> tat's what I'm trying to do, actually
[06:34:50] <[jmc]> * that
[06:35:10] <kerozene> [jmc]: seriously. compare it to yui
[06:35:11] <[jmc]> and I think I've found a way to do so, while I was waiting from someone to answer to my question :P
[06:35:25] <daedeloth> yui any better?
[06:35:39] <ajpiano> kerozene: if jquery ui doesn't have as many widgets as you want, that doesn't mean it "doesnt' have a point"
[06:35:51] <ajpiano> i mean daedeloth
[06:35:58] <[jmc]> kerozene: I know
[06:36:09] <daedeloth> well, I don't know, the way they do it also seems a bit counter inuitive
[06:36:13] <daedeloth> (I don't know how to write that word.)
[06:36:22] <ajpiano> what is "do it"
[06:36:43] <kerozene> counter inuitive is spelled 'patagonian'
[06:36:46] <NodeX> "write it" probably
[06:37:00] <NodeX> do it -> write it *
[06:37:02] <[jmc]> I've read good things about Sencha ExtJS too, but never actually tried it
[06:37:15] <daedeloth> well, the whole start with html, turn into widgets I mean
[06:37:19] <daedeloth> well, I don't know, might be me
[06:37:46] <mazzachre> [jmc]: Hmm.. apparently you can :)
[06:37:47] <NodeX> thats kinda the norm for development - allows for graceful fallback
[06:37:49] <ajpiano> daedeloth: versus what, a more declarative approach?
[06:38:01] <[jmc]> mazzachre: yes, seems reasonable
[06:38:26] <daedeloth> well, let's say the dialog widget, if I want a dialog I want to be able to do alert ('Hi there');
[06:38:27] <daedeloth> or similar
[06:39:00] <NodeX> writing the code for that is about 30 lines to write your own fully functioning dialogue
[06:39:22] <ajpiano> you don't have to start with html already in the dom, daedeloth
[06:39:49] <ajpiano> $("<div>Hi There</div>").dialog()
[06:40:09] <daedeloth> hm, ok well that's better yes
[06:40:11] <daedeloth> true
[06:40:50] <kerozene> sounds like you're interested in frontend templating
[06:41:09] <daedeloth> but they don't even have a way to layout forms nicely...
[06:41:31] <daedeloth> yes, I thought that was the point of jquery ui, front end templating
[06:41:42] <daedeloth> you just send the data to yoru application and the application shows it nicely
[06:42:54] <ajpiano> jQuery UI is not a full-fledged CSS framework for laying out arbitrary elements in the same way as twitter bootstrap/zurb foundation etc
[06:43:04] <[jmc]> well, what you want to show depends on your application, so it can't be automagic
[06:43:09] <ajpiano> ^^
[06:44:30] <daedeloth> well, yes and no
[06:44:55] <daedeloth> well what I want is just to present a structure like html, but with widgets :)
[06:45:05] <daedeloth> so html5 basically
[06:45:41] <[jmc]> html5 isn't actually about widgets
[06:45:57] <[jmc]> you want to create a RIA? (Rich Internet Application)
[06:46:09] <daedeloth> yea
[06:46:54] <daedeloth> ok, well, what I want right now is a very simple range input.
[06:47:16] <[jmc]> oh, that is html5
[06:47:22] <daedeloth> and I would think there was a library that implemented that for me right now :)
[06:47:23] <[jmc]> no need for jQuery or other tools for that
[06:47:37] <daedeloth> well, I also want my range input to work on different browsres ;-)
[06:48:18] <daedeloth> well and I also wnat my range input styleable
[06:49:12] <[jmc]> a slider maybe? http://jqueryui.com/slider/#range
[06:50:01] <NodeX> I would recommend you put your own together from plugins
[06:50:51] <mazzachre> Can you remove as css option? I am dynamically setting an "-ms-filter" but would like to "unset" it... The same with opacity, where I don't really know if setting opacity to 1.0 is the same as removing it?
[06:50:53] <daedeloth> ok jquery ui beat me there :)
[06:52:08] <chadoh> @mazzachre Yes you can. You can find all info on http://api.jquery.com/css/. Search the page for 'remove'.
[06:57:10] <chadoh> Any jquery UI devs on here: I like tooltip, but I want it to work on touch devices with no cursors. So I guess I need it to work with the 'click' event. Do you think it's in the scope of `tooltip` to handle this? Should I fork the repo & start test driving it?
[06:57:27] <ajpiano> chadoh: #jqueryui-dev
[06:57:39] <chadoh> thanks, @ajpiano
[07:04:07] <MartinCleaver> Is there something better for IE that IE Developer Tools?
[07:04:18] <MartinCleaver> s/that/than/
[07:04:56] <MartinCleaver> I inspect the Locals and all I see are jquery functions - I need to see values
[07:05:28] <MartinCleaver> I do appreciate that everything is a function, but something has to be able to show things clearer than this
[07:05:53] <[jmc]> I think there's anything else around
[07:06:17] <[jmc]> I know of DebugBar, but I know it only due to IETester - never tried the debug bar itself
[07:07:18] <jvanveen> hm, chrome-frame :p
[07:07:29] <MartinCleaver> :P
[07:07:31] <MartinCleaver> :)
[07:08:46] <[jmc]> hmm
[07:08:52] <FernandoBasso> t
[07:09:12] <[jmc]> is there any way to make so that the menu widget automatically resizes it to the minimum required width?
[07:09:24] <[jmc]> or do I need to hardcode that value?
[07:12:07] * MartinCleaver looks up attester & debugbar
[07:13:02] <[jmc]> really, no way to do it? :(
[07:13:19] * MartinCleaver has no idea, sorry [jmc] 
[07:15:49] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone advise if this is correct: http://pastie.org/5648541
[07:15:58] <fRAiLtY-> In how I'm declaring the img path
[07:17:24] <[jmc]> I think if you set the attribute you need to wrap it in url(...)
[07:17:29] * MartinCleaver installs IETester, only for it to hang on first run… before I even get to try DebugBar
[07:17:50] <[jmc]> that's what you would do in plain JavaScript at least
[07:18:02] * MartinCleaver reboots
[07:37:00] <xckpd7> question: of course if I have 2 elements, I can do a jquery "method" (whatever it's called) on those elements, e.g. $('.blah, #foo').addClass
[07:37:21] <xckpd7> but how would I assign those elements to variables and then create that the same way?
[07:38:51] <nFFF> $("<div>Hi There</div>")
[07:39:12] <BillCriswell> xckpd7: var $elements = $('.blah, #foo'); $elements.addClass('moo');
[07:41:17] <BillCriswell> fRAiLtY-: That looks fine.
[07:41:32] <xckpd7> BillCriswell: anyway to separate them, and concatenate them later?
[07:41:57] <xckpd7> like assume I want to cache the elements separately to use them separately as well
[07:42:19] <xckpd7> it would be nice if I could do $(foo,bar).addClass
[07:44:51] <BillCriswell> xckpd7: You can use .add()
[07:45:23] <BillCriswell> var $elements = $('.blah'); $elements.add('#foo').addClass('moo')
[07:45:33] <Hooloovoo> xkr47: or do $([el, el2])
[07:45:37] <Hooloovoo> i think that works too
[07:45:37] <BillCriswell> If I'm understanding right.
[07:47:51] <BillCriswell> Hooloovoo: That didn't work. Tried it out of curiosity.
[07:47:55] <xkr47> xkr47?
[07:47:59] <xkr47> Hooloovoo, ?
[07:48:06] <BillCriswell> .add() seems to be the closest thing to concat for jQuery objects?
[07:48:21] <xkr47> ah, xckpd7 I guess you meant
[07:48:40] <BillCriswell> xkr47: Yeah I think so.
[07:58:08] <chadoh> Heyo. I want to include the default theme in my site from jquery's cdn. This URL works: http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.9.2/themes/base/jquery-ui.css BUT I need it to work on https, too. Any pointers?
[07:59:54] <Morthez> chadoh: do you need it to be from Jquery's CDN?
[08:00:57] <Morthez> Google got it over SSL
[08:01:27] <Morthez> and microsoft
[08:02:30] <chadoh> Morthez: it's just easier that way. I'm being lazy.
[08:03:15] <chadoh> I downloaded the stylesheet & added it to my own cdn, but then it couldn't find all the images. So now I need to download all of those, too. Which makes me say "ugh" & want to go back to jquery's cdn.
[08:03:18] <Morthez> easier? :-p in that case, use your own web-server to provide the content :-p
[08:03:42] <Morthez> aah
[08:03:54] <Morthez> aint that a sprite-image?
[08:04:19] <chadoh> Don't think so. It can't find many images.
[08:05:29] <chadoh> ui-bg_glass_95, ui-bg_glass_65, ui-bg_glass_55 to name a few.
[08:06:11] <Morthez> https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide#jquery-ui
[08:06:14] <Morthez> don't work?
[08:07:20] <chadoh> Morthez: I can use it from Google's CDN. Thanks.
[08:07:36] <PKKid4> Whats the best way to check two chunks of HTML are the same (taking into account HTML entities may or may not be encoded)?
[08:12:17] <Sebah> Hey guys. I'm trying to replicate ( to steal might be the right wording for this ) the slider found on this page https://squareup.com/careers. As you may notice there's a slider with two rows of images: one in front one in the back, moving a different speeds, but having one control. The example is a mixture of jquery+css3, but I was wondering if any of you wizards know something similar, but
[08:12:18] <Sebah> built only using jquery. Any help?
[08:12:53] <andrewSC> hi all
[08:21:46] <adamh> /reload style
[08:23:32] <andrewSC> what exactly does e.preventDefault() do?
[08:23:46] <andrewSC> the api doc seems to imply something about not refreshing the page?
[08:23:55] <BillCriswell> It stops the browser from doing what it naturally would.
[08:24:05] <BillCriswell> At least, that's how I think about it.
[08:24:07] <andrewSC> which is what on a keypress for a form?
[08:24:10] <andrewSC> submitting the form?
[08:24:17] <andrewSC> well
[08:24:28] <andrewSC> this keypress being enter on an input element
[08:24:46] <andrewSC> a*
[08:24:54] <BillCriswell> Yeah, event.preventDefault() would keep the form from being submitted in that case.
[08:25:06] <andrewSC> got it, thanks BillCriswell
[08:25:17] <BillCriswell> Sebah: This is pretty damn smooth.
[08:25:27] <andrewSC> I literally have been brewing over this bug at work for a day and just now I got it :(
[08:26:37] <BillCriswell> andrewSC: Happens!
[08:27:09] <xckpd7> Hooloovoo: that works the best for me, thanks
[08:27:26] <xckpd7> Hooloovoo: at least it looks like it, have to figure out the syntax of that
[08:28:18] <andrewSC> BillCriswell: atleast I learned a lot about our backend process and how we auth ;))
[08:28:24] <andrewSC> hahah

[09:13:21] <manda22> hi
[09:13:27] <manda22> i have problem with setting up webform
[09:13:32] <manda22> on html site
[09:25:00] <jeffsmykil> I'm attempting to use Zepto instead of full on jquery for a site im working on, but I keep getting an error in bootstrap.js saying undefined is not a function on line 29
[09:26:00] <jeffsmykil> anyone run into a similar problem?
[09:26:49] <superdmp> so, TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating 'InlineOrdering.jQuery("div.inline-group").sortable') means that it was looking for a function called jQuery on the InlineOrdering object, but jQuery turns out to be undefined - is that correct?
[09:27:52] <cujojp> Undefined method, since bootstrap requires jQuery. So Zepto is missing that method.
[09:27:53] <NicePerson> o/
[09:29:05] <cujojp> Probably not going to get away with using Zepto unless you modify the source and add all the missing methods using the correct name space as well. Not to familiar with zepto.js
[09:29:48] <cujojp> "Please note that all JavaScript plugins require jQuery to be included"
[09:32:47] <jeffsmykil> cujojp: yeah, there are some tickets in the git hub repository for zepto about bootstrap
[09:33:00] <jeffsmykil> cujojp: its just unfortunate since zepto is so compact
[09:33:38] <feverglands> hey I am having some problems with auto complete, I have a pasty of the table creation, and script, NO results are being found
[09:33:40] <feverglands> http://pastebin.com/0506NDY8
[09:35:23] <cujojp> jeffsmykil: Zepto is nice but your talking only a 24k difference in size.
[09:35:41] <jeffsmykil> talking 75k in size
[09:36:01] <jeffsmykil> 94k compressed for jquery 24k for zepto
[09:36:07] <jeffsmykil> not a big deal
[09:36:12] <jeffsmykil> ill use jquery compressed
[09:36:46] <cujojp> -+
[09:36:58] <cujojp> oopps +1
[09:39:21] <jeffsmykil> thanks cujojp
[09:48:09] <superdmp> TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating 'InlineOrdering.jQuery("div.inline-group").sortable') means that it was looking for a function called jQuery on the InlineOrdering object, but jQuery turns out to be undefined - is that correct?
[09:49:47] <Whiskey> Can someone look at this http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/e8u8s/41/
[09:51:38] <andrewSC> hi all
[09:51:44] <andrewSC> (again)
[09:51:46] <andrewSC> haha
[09:52:04] <andrewSC> Is there a way to combine/create a function that fires on a keypress AND a click event?
[09:52:16] <andrewSC> rather than listening for those events individually
[09:52:26] <Brodingo> yes
[09:52:27] <andrewSC> tl;dr trying to remove duplicate code
[09:52:33] <Brodingo> you can map multiple events to the same function
[09:52:38] <andrewSC> hmmmm
[09:52:44] <Brodingo> ?on
[09:52:44] <b-ot> Brodingo, from 1.7
[09:52:44] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:52:49] <b-ot> bot-t, memorised “on()”.
[09:52:51] <bot-t> b-ot, Couldn't find "memorised “on()”." in jQuery Docs.
[09:52:56] <Brodingo> rmill
[09:53:07] <andrewSC> thanks Brodingo
[09:53:56] <Whiskey> I have probelm whit the table inside that hide/show box
[10:03:21] <BillCriswell> O
[10:04:56] <Whiskey> its a bitch
[10:10:06] <Dieterbe> hey, i'm having a weid issue with $.extend; my statement as well as console.log output of the 2 objects getting merged, and the result are here: http://pastie.org/5649546
[10:10:38] <Dieterbe> specifically, i want options['grid']['markings'] (which is undefined in the original array) to become the array that it is in my options array getting merged in
[10:10:53] <Whiskey> its a bitch
[10:12:10] <Dieterbe> sorry my output doesn't contain the correct indentation, but trust me that the 'markings' entry following grid really is inside the grid entry
[10:14:20] <melter> has something on jqueryui.com changed?
[10:15:24] <tw2113> theme
[10:17:03] <Dieterbe> Whiskey: wtf. i remove my console.log statements and then it works (without seeing what happens though)
[10:17:59] <akkufomk> is there a jQuery deal that I can .ensureVisible() on an element and it will scroll a div and make it visible
[10:18:24] <Whiskey> well its the it make a new line in the table Dieterbe: the goal is to show everything on same line, well width the box then to correct size
[10:21:48] <Whiskey> function resizeImage() {var infoViewWidth = $('.infoViewBox').prop('offsetWidth'); $('img').css({'max-width': infoViewWidth - 10});} <--- <div onclick="resizeImage()">
[10:22:11] <Whiskey> its no way to apply that when the box is open? its need to be readed bfore right, document ready or whatever
[10:22:31] <Whiskey> cuz tha works, but not if i don´t set it before, or if i open the div, then close it and open it again, then its applyed
[10:22:54] <Whiskey> actully i culd do that on hoover maybe
[10:24:24] <LokiCod> Hello.
[10:24:41] <LokiCod> I was wondering if there was anyone who could help me with a piece of code.
[10:24:48] <melter> is anyone else having problems with the "view source" link on the jqueryui.com demos?
[10:25:37] <Whiskey> diegok?
[10:25:41] <Whiskey> Dieterbe?
[10:29:37] <mowol> is there some kind of automatic jquery validator for forms? Im imagining something similar to fancybox where its activiated when the input fields has a certain class. And then maybe the rel attribute or a data attribute can tell the validator what it should be validated as. And also required fields or not.
[10:30:29] <Drasqo> Good evening everyone! My apologies if this is the wrong place to ask, but our community is looking for some "simple" website features. Given enough time we would manage ourselves but we are considering the option to outsource it. Possible payments included.
[10:31:55] <NicePerson> ooo payments included
[10:32:20] <NicePerson> goodnes gracious
[10:35:02] <Drasqo> The tasks shouldn't prove too difficult, for example we are looking for a simple registration form wich displays the users signed up, and functions as a mailinglist aswell. Other small tasks like forum installation and configuration, integrated IRC chat on website, and so forth.
[10:36:16] <NicePerson> i like when people describe the dificulty of the task
[10:36:23] <NicePerson> to the person who will be doing it lol
[10:41:39] <MistuhKurtz> lol NicePerson, right?
[10:41:49] <NicePerson> dood i love it
[10:42:05] <NicePerson> my sr programmer used to pull that shit on me
[10:42:38] <NicePerson> then i said in front of management that im doing everything for him and he does nothing
[10:42:45] <Drasqo> Thank you for your time, goodbye
[10:42:49] <NicePerson> since then he got fired
[10:42:55] <NicePerson> now im sr programer
[10:43:04] <NicePerson> gj
[10:43:13] <mouses> i'm looking to update my site and i'm searching for the latest design trends. seems like the new standard is vertical scrolling on a single page
[10:43:17] <mouses> what do you guys think of that?
[10:43:27] <NicePerson> umm
[10:43:31] <NicePerson> it can get a bit annoying
[10:43:42] <tw2113> oh infinite scroll
[10:43:48] <NicePerson> design is about doing it right
[10:44:02] <NicePerson> not neceseraly a particular theme
[10:44:10] <Saaether> i also like it when management tells you how hard a job will be, even more fun =D
[10:44:32] <NicePerson> yeah they are such aholes
[10:44:44] <NicePerson> i say we all start our own companies
[10:44:59] <NicePerson> and band together and sell our own stuff
[10:45:13] <NicePerson> get rid of the cruddy middle man
[10:45:13] <tw2113> thus becoming management with helpers
[10:45:24] <NicePerson> no we manage and code
[10:45:58] <NicePerson> that way we never get brownnosed
[10:46:38] <mouses> vertical scroll definitely tends to be the latest trend
[10:46:45] <mouses> i'm thinking hard about crossing over
[10:47:16] <NicePerson> mouses: what about mobile or tablet
[10:47:31] <mouses> they dont work w/ v scroll?
[10:47:41] <NicePerson> yeah but screen is small
[10:49:12] <NicePerson> ahh ok
[10:49:27] <NicePerson> if you do vert scroll put the stuff on the sides
[10:49:52] <NicePerson> i hate when they have the top nav bar always blocking shit
[10:50:41] <mouses> hmm
[10:51:50] <mouses> design is hard man
[10:51:57] <NicePerson> lol
[10:52:03] <mouses> i like the simple, sleek, elegant, large font looking sites
[10:52:07] <NicePerson> i started w design
[10:52:12] <mouses> its hard to get it right
[10:52:16] <NicePerson> no wait
[10:52:17] <mouses> without overdoing it
[10:52:20] <NicePerson> i started w coding
[10:52:32] <NicePerson> yes overdoing it is the key
[10:52:37] <NicePerson> its like that with music too
[10:54:26] <NicePerson> all this comes from judging yourself
[10:54:33] <mouses> designing and coding are so diff
[10:54:36] <mouses> i started coding
[10:55:11] <NicePerson> ive thrown away so many good things
[10:55:29] <hugo_moss> how can i re-add the width attribute using jquery?
[10:55:34] <hugo_moss> of an img element
[10:55:45] <hugo_moss> ive deleted the width attribute, and i want to re-add it
[10:55:50] <hugo_moss> but it wont work
[10:56:12] <mouses> jsfiddle that joint, bro
[10:56:13] <NicePerson> el.width(123)
[10:56:45] <NicePerson> el.attr('width', 123_;
[10:57:13] <hugo_moss> i do: $('#id').removeAttr('width');
[10:57:14] <hugo_moss> then
[10:57:41] <hugo_moss> $('#id').attr('width', $('#id').offsetWidth );
[10:57:50] <NicePerson> yes
[10:58:04] <hugo_moss> it doesnt readd the width
[10:58:15] <hugo_moss> theres no width tag there after that code is executed
[10:58:23] <hugo_moss> in the dom
[10:58:54] <NicePerson> just use .width(123_
[10:58:57] <NicePerson> just use .width(123);
[10:59:15] <hugo_moss> ok
[10:59:19] <hugo_moss> brb
[10:59:59] <NicePerson> width is a default atribute
[11:00:09] <NicePerson> so maybe browser is messing w it
[11:01:04] <hugo_moss> hmm didnt work
[11:02:34] <NicePerson> jsfiddle it
[11:02:39] <NicePerson> i want to test too
[11:03:00] <mowol> any ideas on how to get rid of the shell error when submitting? http://jsfiddle.net/8XVna/
[11:03:01] <NicePerson> ur probly approaching the problem wrong
[11:03:47] <mouses> is recaptcha still the standard for preventing spam on your contact forms?
[11:04:16] <NicePerson> yes
[11:04:48] <NicePerson> mowol: remove required attribute?
[11:05:01] <mouses> how about mailto: links?
[11:05:27] <mouses> how are you fighting spam with those nowadays? i've been away from hardcore dev for 5 years. i recently came back and learned jquery
[11:05:33] <mouses> my standards are all old
[11:05:58] <mouses> whats the recommended way to display a mailto:  link without getting spammed?
[11:06:21] <NicePerson> huh
[11:06:37] <NicePerson> have a form instead?
[11:06:50] <mouses> yeah i want both
[11:07:11] <[jmc]> mygreataddressNOSPAM@something.tld
[11:07:20] <NicePerson> i never had any problems posting mailto links
[11:07:20] <mouses> it doesnt have to be a mailto: link, but i just want to be able to display me@domain.com
[11:07:38] <[jmc]> mouses: server-generated image with the email address in it?
[11:07:52] <mouses> i used images 5 years ago, i thought something new was better
[11:07:56] <[jmc]> as a last resort, if you desperately don't want clear text addresses
[11:07:58] <mowol> NicePerson that doesnt do anything
[11:07:58] <NicePerson> yu mean like craigslist
[11:08:22] <mouses> i want the user to at least be able to copy and paste my email address, so images wont work
[11:08:46] <NicePerson> mowol: ya it does
[11:08:50] <[jmc]> then it has to be clear text
[11:08:55] <NicePerson> run your code
[11:09:26] <NicePerson> are you talking about masking email address
[11:09:34] <mowol> NicePerson now the fields arent required to be filled out anymore (which they should!) but the error is still there
[11:09:49] <NicePerson> wtf
[11:10:05] <36DACP4K9> can someone tell me a plugin for this kind of slider , its in flash but i want it to be in jquery or javascript https://www.pratham.biz/ongoing_projects.html
[11:10:12] <NicePerson> then build your own plugin
[11:10:45] <nabr0_> mouses: maybe something in here can help - http://www.sitepoint.com/spamproof-site/
[11:12:50] <hugo_moss> yea i think it has something to do with removing the attribute
[11:12:53] <[jmc]> document.write is really not cool
[11:12:54] <mouses> that basically recommends spitting out the link in js... will bots nowadays be fooled by that?
[11:13:02] <[jmc]> and it pollutes the global object
[11:13:09] <kristopolous> any recommendations on a sophisticated js diagramming library?
[11:13:13] <[jmc]> bad js examples, honestly
[11:14:49] <nabr0_> feel free to offer a better solution
[11:14:52] <hugo_moss> ok i got it
[11:14:59] <hugo_moss> offsetwidth was returning undefined
[11:15:13] <NicePerson> lol
[11:16:00] <nabr0_> [not saying i disagree with you]
[11:16:32] <hugo_moss> why is offsetWidth returning undefined
[11:18:40] <ruz1> hey guys any idea for some fancy plugin, for friends invites?
[11:18:58] <ruz1> somenthing like invite a friend by email, from fb, g+, twitter etc etc ..

[11:24:46] <ruz1> wtf …
[11:24:59] <ruz1> oh you so Nice Person
[11:25:25] <hugo_moss> Brodingo: i have an img element with an id of #top_logo
[11:25:27] <bil`> Anyone know something like Jquery UI's Sortable widget but also allows for merging items into a group when they're dropped on to each other?
[11:25:41] <hugo_moss> i'm using $('img#top_logo').offsetWidth
[11:25:49] <hugo_moss> yet its undefined maybe w is not capital?
[11:25:57] <Brodingo> offsetWidth is a DOM element property, not a jquery method
[11:26:21] <Brodingo> $('img#top_logo')[0].offsetWidth
[11:26:26] <hugo_moss> oh
[11:26:26] <hugo_moss> ok
[11:26:27] <NicePerson> we are getting a wave of NONcoders
[11:26:27] <hugo_moss> thanks
[11:27:11] <Brodingo> yw
[11:28:41] <NicePerson> jquery has that effect
[11:28:43] <NicePerson> :D
[11:28:49] <ruz1> what a NicePerson
[11:28:53] <NicePerson> my mom codes
[11:29:09] <hugo_moss> hmm still not workin
[11:29:20] <superdmp> I have managed to create a little widget that will show an input field when a certain value is selected from an options list - http://jsfiddle.net/j2xYs - however, it's very inflexible, because the element ids are hard coded in it
[11:29:20] <ruz1> my father is my PM
[11:29:20] <NicePerson> hugo_moss: jsfiddle
[11:29:48] <superdmp> i.e. for each pair of elements - whereas I would like to make it work for an arbitrary number of pairs
[11:29:59] <superdmp> what should I be looking at to achieve that?
[11:30:16] <ruz1> come on guys any help ? :(
[11:30:52] <NicePerson> ruz1: what ur asking i dont know of plugin
[11:31:12] <NicePerson> i can only build it for 2000 dolar
[11:31:15] <ruz1> TAAAAA-DA http://code.google.com/p/opensocial-jquery/
[11:31:24] <superdmp> so for example, if I had a <select id ="show-hide-n"> it would act on my <input id="shown-hidden-n">, whatever the value of n
[11:31:27] <ruz1> oh yesss oh yes ohhhhhh yes
[11:32:01] <NicePerson> superdmp: can you use the for= attr
[11:32:47] <superdmp> NicePerson:  I can generate whatever HTML is required
[11:33:12] <superdmp> but I am not sure how the for attr of the elements is more helpful to me than the id
[11:33:35] <hugo_moss> what does dom element have to do with accessing a jquery object using an id tag
[11:33:52] <hugo_moss> the jquery object returns an array, but this is a single jquery object with a single id
[11:34:32] <Maverick|MSG> it is possible to use .one to trigger an event when anything *but* a certain item is clicked?
[11:35:33] <Maverick|MSG> like .one( "click", !"#myElement" function() {} );
[11:36:28] <NoiseEee> i think you'd have to:  .one('click','#myElement',function(ev) { //find element, see if it is() a certain item;  if so, return false/no more processing}
[11:36:55] <Maverick|MSG> gotcha, thanks
[11:37:08] <gnarf> Maverick|MSG: i assume you are looking for a click outside of a dialog?
[11:37:18] <gnarf> Maverick|MSG: or a similar use case
[11:37:23] <Maverick|MSG> I've got a bunch of checkboxes in a dropdown
[11:37:38] <Maverick|MSG> but clicking in the dropdown shouldn't close the dropdown
[11:37:39] <gnarf> Maverick|MSG: it would be kinda mean to the event api
[11:38:08] <awc737> how can I append .each, without my results ending up backward?
[11:38:19] <gnarf> Maverick|MSG: what you should do is just bind a named click handler to a parent
[11:38:27] <gnarf> Maverick|MSG: or even namespace it
[11:38:35] <Maverick|MSG> hm, ok, I can check that out
[11:40:23] <gnarf> Maverick|MSG: function closeDialog( event ) { if ( $( event.target ).closest( "#myElement" ).length ) { return ; } ...; $("#container").off("click.closeDialog"); }; $("#container").on("click.closeDialog", closeDialog);
[11:40:45] <gnarf> as an example
[11:40:52] <gnarf> you can just on/off the click handler
[11:41:01] <gnarf> rather than deal with the strange semantics of .one()
[11:43:44] <Maverick|MSG> cool, thanks again
[11:44:16] <gnarf> Maverick|MSG: trying to massage .one() to work with that scenario is probably harder than just doing on/off :)
[11:44:33] <Maverick|MSG> yeah, I was trying to use one since that is what the button ui was using
[11:45:37] <pentarex> hey guys can anyone help me... so i have homework... I have to write whats the pros and cons (usability, performance, scalability, reliability, security, integrability and other kinds of abilities) of the synchronous and asynchronous web technologies..

[11:54:47] <Tomashe> hmm
[11:54:57] <Tomashe> so how do i checed for checked input and see its value
[11:55:01] <ajpiano> i think you want .filter(":checked").val()

[12:18:02] <36DACP4K9> this is a demo fiddle of dock menu type... http://jsfiddle.net/larrybolt/RKdNW/1/, i want to add pages to each link , whenever someone clicks on the icon it will show the page in the given grey area, if one switches from one icon to another it will show that one without any page reload
[12:18:25] <melter> is anyone else having problems with the "view source" link on the jqueryui.com demo pages?
[12:20:58] <tw2113> i see a really huge left indent
[12:23:10] <36DACP4K9> tw2113: where ?
[12:23:39] <tw2113> that was towards melter's question, 36DACP4K9
[12:23:53] <melter> interesting, the behavior varies significantly between browsers
[12:23:56] <36DACP4K9> ohh ok
[12:24:05] <melter> opera vs. firefox vs. chrome: they're all different
[12:26:49] <melter> the jqueryui.com pages vary not just from browser to browser, but also from one demo to another
[12:40:50] <rindolf> Hi all.
[12:42:04] <alexwaters> i have a very nice slideToggle('slow') on a div, but it shows the annimation and then shows a scrollbar on the div. the scrollbar pops in at the end and kind of ruins the flow of the annimation. I have overflow:auto in the css because the content is larger than the div
[12:42:23] <alexwaters> is there a way that I can have the scrollbar slide in with the div?
[12:42:40] <alexwaters> or not pop to the div (and shift the content btw)
[12:45:37] <mlang> http://jsfiddle.net/RRhSZ/
[12:45:50] <mlang> I am trying this, but It seems the click handler doesn't attach to the ID?
[12:46:14] <TylerE> How can I do a crossdomain $.get without wanting to inflict self-harm?
[12:46:25] <TylerE> I'm just trying to do a simple get to another server under my control
[12:46:38] <TylerE> but the chrome same-origin crap is making my life miserable right now
[12:48:21] <NicePerson> TylerE: you need to use pjax
[12:48:48] <TylerE> Nico: Why? What I'm doing is very simple… a simple ad call
[12:48:55] <TylerE> this has been done in JS since the stone ages
[12:49:07] <NicePerson> but ur doing crossdomain?
[12:49:14] <TylerE> yes
[12:49:18] <NicePerson> then you need to use jsonp
[12:49:31] <NicePerson> google jquery jsonp
[12:49:36] <liox_> pliss help me
[12:49:38] <liox_> I'm using the method ajax () to create a website navigation but the content has loaded jquery features are lost and they have to solve this problem?
[12:49:55] <Brodingo> mlang did you forget some code?
[12:50:10] <TylerE> NicePerson: I'm not using json. THe remote script returns an html fragment
[12:50:33] <mlang> Brodingo: Yes, I havent put the entire HTML there. But in general, I'm calling the alert() to see if it attaches - and nothing happens.
[12:50:42] <melter> woot! jqueryui.com demos are working again :)
[12:50:54] <mlang> Because. yeah, okay I see what you are saying.
[12:51:18] <rindolf> melter: excellent.
[12:51:27] <Brodingo> mlang also what is with all the return statements?
[12:51:41] <mlang> Brodingo: CoffeeScript output.
[12:52:03] <Brodingo> weird
[12:55:56] <mlang> Brodingo: Anyhow, the general thing is - the alert doesn't trigger. So it seems like the click event isn't attached
[12:56:56] <Brodingo> so youre clicking something to attach some other clicks depending on a data-*
[12:58:04] <mlang> Well, what happens - I click on a proceed link, lightbox popup for login - that works quite well
[12:58:48] <mlang> But there is also the 'already have an account?' thing - which should trigger a fadeOut/fadeIn of the login-form, instead of the signup-form
[12:59:22] <Brodingo> so why are these other delegated events dependent the first click event?
[12:59:44] <mlang> Because.. I don't know. I tought it would be fitting inside there?
[13:00:27] <mlang> Doesn't make sense?
[13:01:03] <Brodingo> i dunno, cant really see the rest of the stuff
[13:01:12] <Brodingo> but it just seems like you could do it all up front
[13:01:30] <mlang> Even if I take it out there, It doesn't change anything
[13:01:43] <mlang> Its more or less, like it can't find the dom element.
[13:01:51] <mlang> But if I try it in the JS Console, it works fine.
[13:03:40] <chrisbolton> I've got a list of comments for a picture where I'm limiting it to 5. At the end I have the option to add a new comment. When the new comment form is submitted it removes the first comment. Works great. Unfortunately on a photo that has no comments it removes the first comment. Any suggestions on how I should approach this?
[13:06:40] <rindolf> chrisbolton: get a list of comments and access the [-1]
[13:06:54] <rindolf> chrisbolton: but this should be done server-side.
[13:07:37] <BillCriswell> chrisbolton: I think you explained something weirdly.
[13:08:17] <chrisbolton> rindolf: After consulting the API I'm thinking about calling a .length or .size on the ul and only execute the remove 'li' if the size is greater than x.
[13:08:27] <chrisbolton> BillCriswell: probably.
[13:08:50] <rindolf> chrisbolton: on the ul or on the result set?
[13:09:06] <rindolf> chrisbolton: I find you hard to understand.
[13:10:32] <BillCriswell> chrisbolton: Do you just want to add the freshly added comment to the top or bottom of a list?
[13:10:49] <chrisbolton> rindolf: If I call it on #photo_comments li it should count the number of li's in #photo_comments correct? Apologies for being unclear.
[13:11:20] <rindolf> chronos: yes.
[13:11:25] <rindolf> chrisbolton: yes, it should.
[13:11:40] <chrisbolton> BillCriswell: I've done that. I realize my problem is a little more complicated than I explained. Apologize for the confusion.
[13:11:48] <rindolf> chrisbolton: you can do var foo = $("#photocomments > li"); and then foo[-1]
[13:12:12] <rindolf> Unless -1 does not give the last element in JS.
[13:12:29] <BillCriswell> It doesn't the way you're using it.
[13:12:32] <rindolf> chrisbolton: "#photocomments li" is less robust because it finds all descendants.
[13:13:10] <BillCriswell> rindolf: Would need array.slice(-1) to get the last one.
[13:13:11] <chrisbolton> rindolf: Alternative?
[13:13:43] <rindolf> chrisbolton: use >
[13:13:44] <manda22> hi
[13:13:45] <BillCriswell> $('#photocomments > li').eq(-1); would return the last item.
[13:13:54] <BillCriswell> As would #photocomments > li:last
[13:13:54] <manda22> how hard is it to make an iphone app,
[13:13:56] <rindolf> BillCriswell: ah.
[13:14:03] <rindolf> manda22: in ObjC?
[13:14:10] <rindolf> manda22: or as a jQuery web app?
[13:14:13] <manda22> it should be just a calculator
[13:14:13] <manda22> whereever rindolf
[13:14:25] <manda22> or a calculator I can use on my site
[13:14:40] <rindolf> manda22: well, the iPhone (or any other decent smartphone) should handle a web app pretty well.
[13:14:42] <manda22> like each letter would have a value from 1-9
[13:14:46] <rindolf> manda22: but you should test.
[13:14:47] <chrisbolton> rindolf & BillCriswell : Thanks for the help I think I've got my direction.
[13:14:55] <manda22> how to start it?
[13:14:56] <BillCriswell> chrisbolton: Awesome 8-)
[13:15:03] <rindolf> manda22: do you know JS?
[13:15:06] <manda22> no
[13:15:14] <rindolf> manda22: then you should learn it.
[13:15:20] <manda22> what about the excel?
[13:15:25] <rindolf> manda22: Excel?
[13:15:28] <manda22> yes
[13:15:43] <rindolf> manda22: not sure if Excel can export its sheets to a web page.
[13:15:51] <manda22> type in your name and it should throw out the sum of all vibrations of individual letters
[13:16:04] <akkufomk> is there a quick way to change the button size of a button widget
[13:16:08] <rindolf> manda22: variations?
[13:16:21] <manda22> i need something for my users
[13:16:26] <rindolf> manda22: OK.
[13:16:31] <manda22> what is variations rindolf
[13:16:31] <BillCriswell> assume permutations
[13:16:42] <rindolf> manda22: you said vibrations.
[13:16:51] <manda22> i need a numerology program
[13:16:53] * NoiseEee offers popcorn to others
[13:16:56] <rindolf> manda22: ah.
[13:17:03] <rindolf> manda22: OK.
[13:17:07] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Nom nom.
[13:17:07] <manda22> each letter has different vibration
[13:17:15] * NicePerson throws popcorn at NoiseEee 
[13:17:20] <manda22> i would love to do it for iphone
[13:17:24] <manda22> but dunno how
[13:17:29] <rindolf> manda22: don't know what vibration mean in numereology.
[13:17:33] <NoiseEee> manda22: are you familiar with javascript or any programming?
[13:17:38] <rindolf> manda22: just write a web app.
[13:17:38] <manda22> no
[13:17:45] <manda22> how to write webapp?
[13:17:48] <NoiseEee> manda22: well you're goign to have to learn how to program to uh, program
[13:17:51] <manda22> is there an easy program
[13:17:53] <needinghelp> SO I have autocomplete working, but I am completely new to mysql, and php (for that matter), I have a page where the user can create a row in a mysql table, I have another page where a user can use autocomplete to find said data, the problem is this, I want a page on my website to sell "24 carat gold rolexes" I want users to be able to post ads to said page, so lets say a user searches (using autocomplete) for "24 carat" now lets
[13:18:37] <NoiseEee> manda22: no, there is nothing that can automatically make a web app for someone unfamiliar with programming
[13:18:41] <needinghelp> "24 carat gold rolexes", once selects it, and hits submit I want them to be taken to the page where all "24carat gold rolex" ads are placed
[13:19:01] <manda22> what program to use to make an app
[13:19:10] <rindolf> manda22: a text editor or an IDE.
[13:19:21] <manda22> but you need to know php right
[13:19:23] <manda22> or java
[13:19:25] <rindolf> manda22: http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/How_to_start_contributing_to_or_using_Open_Source_Software - see this.
[13:19:44] <rindolf> manda22: well, if it's a simple web page, you just need to know HTML.
[13:20:13] <rindolf> manda22: and there are other server-side technologies.
[13:20:31] <rindolf> manda22: there's also server-side JavaScript.
[13:20:32] <needinghelp> problem is this, I want the user to be able to create a page, kind of like  a new thread in a forum, if the page doesnt exist
[13:21:46] <rindolf> needinghelp: shouldn't it be done server-side?
[13:22:28] <needinghelp> rindolf but I want the user to be abl;e to make a new page, if the topic doesnt exist, IE "24 carat silver rolexes"
[13:22:47] <rindolf> needinghelp: OK. Then you can use AJAX.
[13:22:54] <needinghelp> I understand how this is done, using if doesnt exist
[13:22:58] <BillCriswell> needinghelp: Don't think about it in terms of pages. Think about it as search queries.
[13:23:26] <NoiseEee> or as a forum, since you're in that mindset already
[13:23:37] <needinghelp> but this is my problem guys, I dont understand , do I attach hyperlinks to mysql rows?
[13:23:44] <needinghelp> how does it work
[13:24:41] <needinghelp> can I attach a hyperlink to a mysql id,   so when a user uses autocomplete, if he does find the topic hes looking for it takes him to a page
[13:25:24] <needinghelp> you guys get what im saying?
[13:28:08] <BillCriswell> you should not need urls in your database.
[13:28:18] <needinghelp> so how does it work
[13:28:46] <needinghelp> hol don billcriswell let me try and make what I am saying clearer
[13:29:02] <monk3y> needinghelp: I think I get your intended functionality, but you need to understand a lot more about the basics of web-apps, and its going to take a lot of reading and 'doing', instead of us answering it in a few lines in an IRC channel.
[13:29:31] <needinghelp> Yeh I know monk3y, just want a push in the right direction buddy
[13:29:40] <needinghelp> Im ready to do the reading and learning
[13:30:01] <catcher> needinghelp, are you using a framework, or just php/mysql?
[13:30:12] <needinghelp> just php/mysl
[13:30:23] <needinghelp> mysql*
[13:31:10] <djQuery> grrr always mess up on
[13:32:00] <needinghelp> I guess it is done with php right, ie, if data doesnt exist in mysql database, then add it, and create page
[13:32:07] <djQuery> $tips.on('blur', 'input' function(){console.log('blured');});
[13:32:12] <catcher> needinghelp, you can store lots of things in the DB, including a partial/full url.
[13:32:22] <needinghelp> but how do I link the created page to the mysql entry
[13:32:32] <BillCriswell> needinghelp: You would need URL's like this... site.com/item.php?id=5 then you would search your items database id column for the number 5 and generate the page based on what the SQL returns.
[13:32:59] <monk3y> http://www.siteground.com/tutorials/php-mysql/display_table_data.htm ?
[13:33:07] <djQuery> or learn some MVC framework
[13:33:26] <BillCriswell> needinghelp: You can get the id=5 through $_GET['id']
[13:33:33] <djQuery> so the url would be example.com/item/5
[13:33:38] <BillCriswell> This is not a jQuery question at all, though.
[13:33:49] <djQuery> not realy
[13:33:49] <BillCriswell> djQuery: Keeping it simple for now!
[13:34:39] <needinghelp> BillCriswell understands what I am saying, so I use the table row ID in mysql, (which is auto incrementing ) to link to a page?
[13:35:24] <needinghelp> so is the page created using php, when the user adds the mysql data
[13:35:38] <needinghelp> and then the page is linked to said row id
[13:35:45] <BillCriswell> You don't need to do anything with htaccess or httpd.conf to do items.php?id=5 where as you would with /items/5
[13:36:41] <tcstar> who uses query string anymore though...
[13:37:05] * monk3y quickly goes and refactors out all his uses of the GET query-string
[13:38:28] <BillCriswell>  needinghelp: Yes.
[13:39:22] <needinghelp> so when the user inputs some data, to mysql, lets say this row ends up with an id of "1", at the same time, the user creates a page, but how is this page linked, to that mysql row id "1"
[13:40:10] <catcher> needinghelp, a new page isn't created, the data on it is generated dynamically.
[13:40:32] <BillCriswell> needinghelp: It would be liked through whateveryouwant.php?id=1
[13:41:09] <BillCriswell> Then the contents of whateveryouwant.php would have to know how to query with the id variable.
[13:41:41] <needinghelp> Hmm I am not sure I am making myself very clear
[13:42:23] <BillCriswell> needinghelp: The "page" should be nothing more than a template that might hold some data based on the validity of the id it's being passed.
[13:42:47] <needinghelp> right, so variables of some sort fill in said data on the template
[13:42:57] <BillCriswell> needinghelp: Yes.
[13:44:04] <Zitter> I have a <li> inside a table cell with .resizable() function attached. How is it possible to know when resized element (permitted only on Est) come across to the adiacent cell?
[13:44:10] <needinghelp> okay great that taught me the answer I had a question to later on, is this how profiles on social networks are created IE, when you upload a background for your`e profile, it could be "$10000000000000"
[13:44:56] <needinghelp> but it is not what I am asking
[13:45:11] <needinghelp> sorry if you havent got time for this
[13:45:59] <BillCriswell> Yeah, all you are is a line in a database with the ID of 902343782923 or something.
[13:47:31] <ilian> I have the following problem, in a list the last item is "show more" clicking it, I load more items via ajax and use li.prepend(new_items) to put the above it
[13:48:06] <ilian> but when I click on it 2nd time it prepends the new items not before the last li, but where it has been initiall
[13:48:14] <ilian> any ideas how to fix it?
[13:49:32] <BillCriswell> ilian: It sounds like you may be prepending improperly?
[13:50:53] <ilian> BillCriswell, the ajax return json containing html so I use el.parent().prepend(result.videos)
[13:51:07] <ilian> the parent is because I have a-tag inside the li
[13:53:22] <BillCriswell> ilian: You're prepending to the <li> so you're putting the new items inside the <li>.
[13:53:27] <BillCriswell> Is that what you planned on?
[13:53:59] <ilian> no, the new items are li-s so I want to put them in the ul
[13:54:35] <ilian> omg, it puts them inside the list
[13:54:40] <BillCriswell> Ok, so doing $('li').prepend('<li>Hi</li>') outputs <li><li>Hi</li></li>. I think you want .before().
[13:54:42] <ilian> *insude the li
[13:54:50] <ilian> BillCriswell, thanks
[13:54:55] <BillCriswell> ilian: No problem!
[13:55:59] <bt9> in jqueryui tabs, how would i set a callback to fire once a tab transition completes?
[13:56:41] <gx> I'm using datatables to display some information that's being grabbed via ajax. I want to add an extra field to the table that contains some dynamic html. Anyone have experience with that?
[13:57:37] <awc777> is it ok to use an object in a value in an object?
[13:57:47] <awc777> http://paste.laravel.com/f9i
[13:57:48] <BillCriswell> bt9: Think you want this: http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#event-activate
[13:58:17] <bt9> BillCriswell nice one
[13:59:16] <BillCriswell> awc777: Don't see why not.
[14:11:00] <meekohi> Is there a way I can call a function every time a new <img/> is created in the DOM?
[14:11:35] <meekohi> I'm trying to use .on() on the parent element, but events like onload or oncomplete don't bubble up?
[14:13:31] <coachz> anyone know a simple and free audio player for html5 for playing mp3's in browsers including firefox ?
[14:13:49] <BillCriswell> meekohi: $('img').each(function(){ someFunction(); });
[14:14:08] <BillCriswell> Oh, every time a new one is created.
[14:14:10] <meekohi> BillCriswell: that won't effect new img elements as they are created. ;)
[14:14:36] <BillCriswell> meekohi: I only read half of everything till after I answer it. It's a stupid habit.
[14:14:46] <BillCriswell> Till I _think_ I answer it.
[14:14:53] <meekohi> BillCriswell: I will forgive you, IF you answer the real question correctly ;D
[14:15:23] <Leentje> meekohi: try .on()
[14:16:32] <meekohi> Leentje: as in, $(document).on("onload","img", … ) ?
[14:16:49] <BillCriswell> Don't need "onload", just "load".
[14:17:01] <BillCriswell> You can try that I supposed... only way I can think of at least.
[14:17:18] <catcher> meekohi, you'll have a better go if you can attach the logic to the thing(s) creating the images.
[14:17:36] <aclockworkpeter> hello everyone
[14:17:40] <meekohi> catcher: Unfortunately I can't, there are other scripts on the page I don't have control over creating the images.
[14:18:19] <aclockworkpeter> I am trying to trigger a "change" event on a hidden field and it is not working in internet explorer
[14:18:50] <aclockworkpeter> any idea why this might be? my listener is not firing... this set up works for me in chrome and firefox
[14:19:13] <shoky> meekohi: you can't do that in a nice cross-browser way
[14:21:17] <catcher> meekohi, with any luck, the other scripts will provide callbacks
[14:24:49] <superdmp> does anyone have a suggestion for http://jsfiddle.net/j2xYs/9/ ? It explains the (simple I think) issue
[14:25:34] <NicePerson> have you guys messed w accumulator buffers
[14:25:44] <NicePerson> they make awesome effects
[14:26:45] <BillCriswell> superdmp: You would want to look into .next() I think.
[14:29:27] <BillCriswell> superdmp: Real basic demo here: http://jsfiddle.net/GudQP/
[14:29:55] <superdmp> thanks BillCriswell, I will look more closely into that, though I think it will only work on immediate following siblings - whereas my real case (unlike the demo) will have more elements in it
[14:30:04] <superdmp> ace, tahnks
[14:30:44] <BillCriswell> superdmp: If they're in a common container you can do like .closest('div').find('input[type=text]').css('display', val );
[14:31:02] <superdmp> ok BillCriswell  that's brilliant, many thanks for the demo
[14:31:12] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[14:32:26] <superdmp> BillCriswell:  really appreciated - I've made a note of all that, I feel I can finally go to bed now and pick it up again at work in the morning
[14:32:47] <BillCriswell> superdmp: Usually a good approach. When you're tired nothing seems to work
[14:35:48] <motox> I am using the jquery mousewheel plugin to allow a div to be scrollable that does not have scrollbars.  Is there a way to disable the scrollwheel on the rest of the body when the mouse is over that div?  Right now, it scrolls both the div and the body at the same time
[14:37:10] <[jmc]> motox: preventDefault?
[14:37:21] <[jmc]> a wild guess
[14:37:55] <[jmc]> in your case I would always make the handler end like this : function (evt) { ...; evt.preventDefault(); return false; };
[14:38:17] <motox> jmc> ok, thanks.  I am looking into that
[14:41:23] <greg5green> superdmp: I would think you would be better off using .index() -- in my mind at least, it's a simpler solution
[14:41:42] <greg5green> errr, nm, he signed off.
[14:48:39] <motox> [jmc] that did the trick, thanks!
[14:48:45] <[jmc]> yw
[14:56:59] <foo> I am having a problem with swipe.js - the width is set wrong on the images when you swipe through them. I cannot seem to figure this out. http://screencast.com/t/tV0xkqVg - eg. this is swipeable on an iPad. See how the image isn't lined up properly?
[15:02:49] <innociv_> Is there something more recent than jquery bbq for hash events?  It's such an old plugin and all. Or should I just use that?
[15:03:21] <NicePerson> use that
[15:03:24] <NicePerson> its good
[15:03:40] <needinghelp> BillCriswell
[15:03:49] <rmill> It may be old, but it's probably one of the best libs out there for the task.
[15:04:04] <rmill> er, plugins
[15:04:29] <NicePerson> before that it was rsh
[15:14:47] <needinghelp> can someone point me in the right direction on how to get this working, without having user profiles or sessions http://s9.postimage.org/oh8ms2y9b/webss.png
[15:16:50] <needinghelp> how do I fill in a template with user details, then link the created page to a mysql iad
[15:17:05] <needinghelp> id*
[15:17:56] <needinghelp> so that when someone chooses an autofill result, they are sent to said page
[15:43:36] <pauldunn_> hi all
[15:43:45] <FLeiXiuS> With the latest firefox ugprades, on 1.6.X builds I am receiving 'too much recursion' errors on all $.ajax requests.
[15:43:50] <pauldunn_> is it possible to set the timezone for a datepicker?
[15:44:19] <needinghelp> I have a question, how does one link a page to a mysql id, without having user profiles, Im "trying" to develope a site where users can create pages, some information regarding that specific page are sent to mysql, how do I link this page to the mysql entry? so that when users use, jquerie autocomplete, to search the mysql database, and find what they are looking for it then takes them to the page that was created when the mysql 
[15:44:45] <pauldunn_> I need my site visitors to see the server time when using a datepicker
[15:44:51] <pauldunn_> not their local time
[15:48:00] <pauldunn_> anyone?
[15:49:05] <myrman> accio server time!
[15:50:36] <pauldunn_> ?
[15:50:47] <pauldunn_> myrman: what is that?
[15:51:10] <myrman> It's a spell from harry potter
[15:51:12] <myrman> Not very helpful
[16:05:16] <initself> what do you call a thing that you can key in a value, the matching values pop up and then you can select from them and it will populate a list of items?
[16:15:06] <theBrettman> if I want to get a collection and split it into other collections with 4 in each, how could I do that?
[16:16:18] <theBrettman> so then I can run equalHeights() on the first 4 and they will set all boxes to the height of the tallest and that will fit on one row and the next row will fit 4 more that will be set to the tallest of that row, etc...
[16:16:45] <theBrettman> since I can't use tables...
[16:17:43] <developer> is there a html5 upload script that works right of thebox ?
[16:18:29] <theBrettman> upload scripts have to work with a backend language
[16:18:38] <theBrettman> like php or something
[16:19:09] <developer> ok lets say just php and JQ is there that  works right of the box?
[16:19:21] <theBrettman> yeah, it's called wordpress, lol.
[16:19:25] <developer> i tried uploadify, when i upload no file in folder
[16:19:25] <theBrettman> other than that, idk
[16:19:55] <theBrettman> I'm sure there's lots but I don't use them.
[16:20:37] <developer> :( can somebody give me a html5 upload with progress bar
[16:20:51] <theBrettman> google it silly
[16:21:05] <developer> i am lol
[16:22:03] <theBrettman> http://www.plupload.com/
[16:22:26] <developer> yes i tried that yesterday i dont get it :(
[16:22:49] <developer> how can i set it up for php or html5
[16:23:05] <developer> Brettman can you give me a working example :(
[16:23:15] <theBrettman> well then do a tutorial: http://www.script-tutorials.com/pure-html5-file-upload/
[16:24:26] <developer> ok look at this example
[16:24:28] <developer> http://www.plupload.com/example_jquery_ui.php
[16:24:34] <developer> where the hell do the upload files GO?
[16:24:45] <developer> every upload script is the same no idea where the files go :(
[16:26:10] <theBrettman> it says in the php file
[16:26:43] <developer> hmmm sorry but can you please tell me where that is :(
[16:27:00] <theBrettman> in the tutorial, they don't upload the file
[16:27:08] <theBrettman> so look at another one that is just a php uploader
[16:27:50] <theBrettman> I wouldn't use the tutorial tho. I would use the plupload
[16:28:10] <theBrettman> just go to their forum and see if anyone else is having the same problem as you
[16:28:39] <developer> im doing it now
[16:29:39] <theBrettman> http://www.plupload.com/example_custom.php
[16:29:44] <theBrettman> use that example
[16:43:36] <DylanJ> should $.ajax( { url: 'foo', data: bar } ) send cookies in the request?
[16:47:52] <foo> I am using swipe.js ( http://swipejs.com/ ) - but the width seems off. eg. swipe too many times to the right, and you can see the images keep getting more and more cut off. Weird.
[16:47:56] <foo> Any two cents?
[16:48:54] <Eviltwin> I'd contact @bradbirdsall
[16:49:09] <headmold> i used to buy weed off that guy
[16:50:25] <sayd> hi can someone tell me why this .each call wouldnt iterate over my array? http://jsfiddle.net/88LNR/
[16:51:05] <sayd> basically my array is initialized as empty ([]); and I add object keys (arr['foo'] = {})
[16:51:31] <sayd> is there some "rule" or glitch that would prevent me from iterating that?
[16:51:45] <ryanneufeld> sayd: that would be because you're doing it wrong http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[16:52:19] <headmold> sayd: http://jsfiddle.net/88LNR/1/
[16:52:26] <headmold> start with {}, not []
[16:52:30] <Eviltwin> sayd: Use [] for arrays with numerical keys
[16:52:39] <Eviltwin> Where you have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...
[16:52:45] <ryanneufeld> sayd: you must be a PHP dev?
[16:52:51] <Eviltwin> Use {} for string keys
[16:52:51] <sayd> hehe yea
[16:52:53] <sayd> well
[16:52:53] <Eviltwin> Like you have
[16:52:57] <headmold> i'm having a wonderful time guys
[16:53:10] <ryanneufeld> sayd: yeah, PHP kinda bastardized arrays
[16:53:20] <ryanneufeld> sayd: all arrays in php are actually hashes
[16:53:25] <ryanneufeld> it's kinda effed up
[16:53:36] <Eviltwin> Although JavaScript is not better, allowing you to make an associative array
[16:53:43] <Eviltwin> And an object
[16:54:20] <sayd> Eviltwin: what do you mean use {} for string keys
[16:55:06] <ryanneufeld> Eviltwin: there is no accosiative arrays in JS, aren't they just plain objects?
[16:55:16] <headmold> associative*
[16:55:25] <ryanneufeld> sayd: what he's saying is, use an object, not an array for string keys
[16:55:26] <sayd> i think i get it, just don't use objects besides numbers for arrays
[16:55:30] <Eviltwin> ryanneufeld: I mean doing what he's doing: http://blog.xkoder.com/2008/07/10/javascript-associative-arrays-demystified/
[16:55:34] <sayd> s/arrays/array keys
[16:55:36] <Eviltwin> It doesn't do what you expect
[16:55:40] <ryanneufeld> javascript does not have assoc arrays
[16:55:59] <ryanneufeld> you can access the properties of an object in a similar way though
[16:57:10] <sayd> it shows up when you for( prop in stream)
[16:57:23] <sayd> but maybe thats hacky
[16:58:31] <sayd> stream being an array with obj keys
[16:59:39] <sayd> i basically want to make a hash
[16:59:56] <sayd> an array or object with unique keys
[17:00:02] <Eviltwin> Do you know what JSON is?
[17:00:12] <sayd> Eviltwin: sure
[17:00:22] <Eviltwin> So do you understand how [] and {} work there?
[17:00:37] <sayd> i mean prob not inside and out but usually [] contain other objects
[17:01:00] <Eviltwin> But why are there two different ones?
[17:01:01] <sayd> and {} is what i would think of as a hash
[17:01:03] <Eviltwin> They both contain things
[17:01:17] <Eviltwin> What different purposes do they serve?
[17:01:56] <sayd> Eviltwin: they are both objects, but i think the array has a size/length associated with it
[17:02:20] <Eviltwin> The array has order and the object does not
[17:02:31] <Eviltwin> That's the idea at least
[17:03:11] <sayd> interestante
[17:03:26] <Eviltwin> For an array, you should be performing the push/pop/shift/unshift-style operations
[17:03:36] <sayd> thats where sort comes in?
[17:03:47] <Eviltwin> Adding/removing to/from the beginning and end
[17:04:26] <sayd> i have a json object with an items array, with each item having an { origin: { ..some props.. }}
[17:04:35] <Eviltwin> Objects are a key-value mapping
[17:04:59] <sayd> i was thinking i needed to rebuild a new obj/array and take care of the sorting there and group by origin
[17:05:56] <sayd> so id=feeds[i].origin.id; stream[id] = feeds[i]
[17:20:35] <exxy-> Love the new documentation design!
[17:21:55] <bricker> how would I send POST a form with ajax to a URL besides what's hardcoded as the action? I *could* manually build the POST data by going through each input in the form, but isn't there a better way? $("form").submit("/preview/") or something
[17:25:15] <headmold> $('form').attr('action', 'someotherurl').submit() ?
[17:25:20] <Eviltwin> bricker: http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[17:25:37] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[17:25:39] <headmold> ooh that's better
[17:26:00] <bricker> Eviltwin: that will probably work, thank you!
[18:06:50] <bricker> Is there a "correct" way to take a big long string of query parameters and add another key/value to it? Besides just appending "&id=0"
[18:06:56] <bricker> that doesn't seem right
[18:07:55] <sdwrage> is there a Jquery plugin that allows you to zoom in to an x, y in a canvas? Essentially translating and scaling all graphics in the canvas window
[18:08:46] <sdwrage> something along the lines of $("canvas").zoom(x, y, zoom strength); I know I am reaching here but thought id look to you all as I have tried to search for something on this
[18:47:41] <heath> https://gist.github.com/d566e4aca51e6f39cca5
[18:47:43] <heath> any ideas why the ajax post request isn't making it to the server?
[18:47:45] <heath> curl and web browser requests are making it there
[19:12:13] <v3n0w> Hi guys. I'm a desktop programmer, so I'm not very familiar with web programming. But what I want is very simple, there's a jquery function that sends a POST to a php page. I want to know how to replicate this post using only a browser resquest, like... www.h.com/page.php?id=1&post=like...
[19:12:32] <v3n0w> Here's the function: http://pastebin.com/mRVpcdaY
[19:12:32] <v3n0w>  And here's what I tried but it didnt work out: http://blocooba.com.br/mansao/wp-content/plugins/wti-like-post/wti_like.php?post_id=101&task=like&num=1234235
[19:19:19] <coldhead> v3n0w: the AJAX version you have there is making a POST request
[19:19:30] <coldhead> and it seems like you want to change that to a GET request
[19:19:52] <coldhead> what you tried should work IF the php code on the server is happy to accept GET as well as POST requests
[19:19:57] <coldhead> which it probably isn't
[19:20:20] <coldhead> it may be as simple as modifying the PHP and changing every occurence of $_POST to $_GET
[19:21:21] <v3n0w> coldhead, I see, so a "browser resquest" is the same as a "GET". I have no acess to the code, the site is not mine. What is other way of doing a POST like that...
[19:21:58] <coldhead> there is no other way
[19:22:20] <coldhead> POST and GET send data in different ways
[19:22:36] <coldhead> if the server is expecting POST you can't expect it to read GET data
[19:22:41] <coldhead> if it's not programmed to
[19:23:19] <coldhead> you could use CURL or something to send POST data
[19:23:28] <coldhead> why do you need to do this, anyway?
[19:23:45] <innociv_> guys like
[19:23:47] <innociv_> What the fuck
[19:23:52] <innociv_> can I go back to the old jsfiddle?
[19:25:00] <v3n0w> coldhead, is to create a voting bot... I need to change proxy and POST. I think python is a good way to go?
[19:25:43] <danheberden> innociv_: but it has the cool tab complete thing
[19:25:52] <danheberden> type div.something and then press TAB
[19:25:57] <innociv_> But it's completely broken
[19:26:17] <innociv_> select all often clears the whole code.  Often can't copy paste. Doesn't even work at all in chrome.
[19:26:20] <danheberden> BUT THE TAB COMPLETE
[19:26:21] <danheberden> haha
[19:26:25] <v3n0w> coldhead, do you think there's any protection besides IP ?
[19:26:48] <munderwo-work> Hi all. Im doing some Backbone stuff so fairly heavy on DOM manipulations etc. I've got a function that cleans up on page transition, and In there I have a loading dialog popup, but it seems on chrome that the rendering thread doesn't get control to render that dialog at the right time. is there a way to make the dialog render before doing eveything else?
[19:27:09] <danheberden> innociv_: you could go into #jsfiddle and give zalun a piece of your mind
[19:27:26] <innociv_> I'm sure lots of others are complaining
[19:27:44] <coldhead> v3n0w: i have no idea, you'll have to try it and see
[19:27:45] <innociv_> I don't get why this isn't beta.jsfiddle.net or something
[19:27:51] <munderwo-work> v3n0w: If your doing http requests in python I highly recoomend (read dont do it any other way) using the requests library. Its a third party library that kicks the pants of the standard library when it comes to http requests
[19:27:52] <coldhead> yes you could do it in python
[19:28:09] <coldhead> i hope we're not helping you to cheat
[19:29:34] <v3n0w> coldhead, Well it is no big deal...
[19:29:45] <coldhead> MAYBE NOT TO YOU, CHEATER
[19:30:21] <coldhead> i'm kidding, sometimes flooding voting booths is the only way i can feel alive anymore
[19:30:52] <v3n0w> munderwo-work, thank you, I just need to post and change proxy... POST must be easy, but change proxy I have no idea...
[19:31:39] <v3n0w> coldhead, no problem, it is about a full paid carnival, drinks and house for four days...
[19:31:50] <munderwo-work> v3n0w: why do you need to change the proxy? cross domain restrictions only apply to javascript. If your doing it from python you can do whatever you want..
[19:32:35] <v3n0w> munderwo-work, well, the php checks my IP so I can't vote again, right?
[19:33:13] <v3n0w> munderwo-work, so the bot changes is IP, from a proxy list, and POST...
[19:33:19] <munderwo-work> v3n0w: ahhh, well in that case.. not sure how you do that then..
[19:34:55] <v3n0w> Ok, thank you very much guys, I appreciate the help...
[19:40:53] <coldhead> lol Jennifer
[19:50:18] <36DACP4K9> i want to show the thumbnail different but the images will come as given in the list http://sulopa.net/kalps/completed-projects/
[19:52:31] <coldhead> eh?
[20:07:07] <Antera> hello dears, it's been 2 hours i'm looking for a Jquery Calendar for booking : can show 6 months, can select a range (from>to), and can set availabilities date
[20:09:38] <tw2113> RIP MSN Messenger
[20:32:05] <Antera> Do you know where can I find the same as this in Jquery please ? http://stephencelis.github.com/timeframe/
[20:37:18] <hyperair> hi. is there a way i can refresh the position of a jqueryui tooltip?
[20:37:59] <hyperair> i'm trying to add a tooltip that follows the jqueryui slider's handle, but when the handle moves about, it leaves the tooltip behind.
[20:44:19] <matt-chars> I'm having a conflict with jQuery's $.post() and Google's ReCaptcha. On internet explorer only, my form gets reset on submit and won't successfully send. When I remove the captcha, things seem to work properly. Has anyone dealt with this before?
[20:44:40] <aqeel> hi everyone..
[20:44:53] <aqeel> https://github.com/aeurielesn/jQuery.fn/blob/master/%24.fn.mousehold/%24.fn.mousehold.js......just found it..
[20:45:15] <aqeel> how reliable is this?
[20:45:45] <mansoor-s> Antera, have you looked at jquery UI?
[21:02:32] <Cork> aqeel: tips for the future... space around urls >_>
[21:02:55] <aqeel> sorry and thanks..
[21:03:12] <aqeel> so how good is that plugin
[21:04:44] <Cork> well its quite simple
[21:05:04] <Cork> i'm struggling at understanding why it triggers the mousedown twice though
[21:05:38] <Cork> ah no not twice
[21:05:59] <Cork> it repeatedly triggers mousedown as long as the button is pressed
[21:06:00] <aqeel> based on original from here... http://remysharp.com/2006/12/15/jquery-mousehold-event/
[21:06:44] <Cork> not sure why one would want to have that
[21:07:05] <aqeel> but the difference is delegation.. which one should i use..
[21:07:19] <Cork> mousemove + listing for mousedown would do it less hacky
[21:07:54] <Cork> unless you need it to repeatedly trigger even if nothing changes
[21:08:50] <aqeel> well the thing is i want to make a fast forward and fast rewind buttons, so if you keep press it will do ff || rw and stops when mouse is up or out of the button area
[21:09:34] * Cork nods
[21:10:07] <Cork> the the last one is a lot better at least
[21:10:31] <Cork> the first one generates a lot of dom events that needs to bubble (with the wrong information too)
[21:10:47] <Cork> the other just calls a callback
[21:10:53] <aqeel> well https://gist.github.com/1396394 , improved version
[21:11:23] <aqeel> this one too, http://www.spodesabode.com/discussion/300/jquery-mousehold-plugin-improved/
[21:11:32] <aqeel> so i am confused as hell too
[21:12:44] <Cork> only improvment with the second last version is that it includes the event object in the callback call
[21:13:30] <Cork> the first one would be ok if it just used a separate event
[21:13:51] <Cork> so ex. it triggered a mousehold event instead of falsify the mousedown event
[21:14:45] <Cork> or musepressed to keep inline with the naming norm
[21:14:50] <Cork> *mousepressed
[21:15:21] <aqeel> what about the last one..
[21:16:07] <aqeel> read the last comment and see its code change
[21:16:17] <Cork> the last one just talks about the second last one as far as i can see
[21:16:30] <Cork> ah no
[21:18:14] <Cork> the last one looks like the worst of them all
[21:19:11] <Cork> ah, no scratch that its just the initial event listener
[21:19:30] <Cork> the last two depends on setInterval though, witch is a bad idea
[21:20:31] <aqeel> so that is why i am kinda googling on this...
[21:20:49] <aqeel> so which one should i go for..
[21:20:50] <Cork> so my answer is prob, i wouldn't use any of them
[21:21:02] <coldhead> i would use them all
[21:21:20] <Cork> aqeel: the first one has potential though
[21:21:31] <Cork> it should just be cleaned up a bit
[21:21:56] <aqeel> like..
[21:23:27] <Cork> aqeel: something like http://jsfiddle.net/YjhXd/
[21:24:44] <Cork> opps should be http://jsfiddle.net/YjhXd/1/
[21:27:37] <cssboss> Hello, does anyone know what the jquery event for detecting when a <select> field has been changed is? i'm trying to alert with $(input).live('click',function(){ alert('hi'); });  but click only works on the radio buttons. Thanks.
[21:28:15] <shoky> change
[21:30:15] <cssboss> That doesn't seem to be alerting either,
[21:32:44] <coldhead> $(input).live('click change blur'
[21:34:55] <cssboss> I just got it to work with change, I applied a class to the <select tag and used that as the selector.
[21:35:13] <cssboss> thanks coldhead, i forgot about blur.
[21:35:26] <aqeel> cssboss: http://jsfiddle.net/4LfBX/
[21:35:47] <shoky> except he was asking about a <select>
[21:36:03] <pdyz> hi all
[21:36:11] <cssboss> Thank you all for the help. :)
[21:38:18] <cssboss> Really cool, change works for the radio buttons as well so I don't need to include click :D
[21:40:28] <pdyz> for JQM, does anyone know why I $.mobile.changePage to another page (# in same html) the css is not styling ?
[21:46:50] <Antera> how can I get the result of this please, is there a "onChange" or something ? I dont get it : http://multidatespickr.sourceforge.net
[21:47:45] <coldhead> pdyz: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/page-not-styling-when-using-changepage
[21:48:05] <tw2113> sup n00bsauce coldhead
[21:48:17] <coldhead> general ignorance
[21:48:21] <coldhead> today: of facebook
[21:48:32] <tw2113> fuck em
[21:48:52] <coldhead> i am a thought leader in fisting
[21:50:09] <coldhead> studied bees two librans
[21:51:57] <pdyz> coldhead: but I'm loading another div data-role="page" within same html, I don't think the ? is applicable here ... and also the changePage syntax seems outdated
[21:52:08] <coldhead> yeah man i don't know
[21:52:11] <coldhead> i just googled
[21:52:18] <coldhead> it's my first day using jquery mobile
[21:52:29] <coldhead> so far it's been pretty bad :(
[21:52:48] <tw2113> did you actually manage to make a website with it?
[21:53:36] <coldhead> depends who you ask
[21:53:56] <coldhead> the tester and the developers and the project manager would say no, the CEO who hasn't tested it would say yes
[21:54:15] <coldhead> if a website is just something that takes up space on a web server then hell yes, emphatically
[21:55:04] <tw2113> :D
[21:57:31] <Cork> lol
[21:57:37] <Cork> coldhead++
[21:59:48] <pdyz> seriously, coding JQM gave me cancer... I mean, you encountered tons of problems but none of the solution on google works for you
[22:01:00] <tw2113> i've never been tasked with it, so my hands are clean
[22:03:16] <Cork> i just checked it and then went with plain jquery
[22:04:49] <coldhead> the way it keeps pages you've previously navigated to still in the DOM is uh fun
[22:05:08] <coldhead> i had some code like this to populate a textarea for a post to twitter
[22:05:18] <coldhead> var val = $('.tweetcopy').text();
[22:05:41] <coldhead> after a bit of browsing that was concatenating about 6 tweetcopy <spans>
[22:05:44] <coldhead> so now my code is
[22:05:58] <coldhead> var val = $('.tweetcopy:visible:last').text();
[22:06:06] <coldhead> thank god we don't have code reviews
[22:06:11] <coldhead> or users
[22:06:13] <Cork> heh
[22:10:31] <coldhead> argh my spine
[22:33:52] <andrewhl> Can someone help me? I'm trying to serialize form data and interpolate it into a SQL insertion. I think I'm going about it the wrong way though... https://gist.github.com/4491119
[22:40:51] <raj> shoky, ping
[22:45:19] <Cork> andrewhl: nodejs?
[22:46:01] <andrewhl> Cork: No. It's for PhoneGap. Apache Cordova. Using web SQL
[22:46:05] <Cork> ah
[22:46:46] <Cork> try '" + fields.join("','") + "'
[22:46:46] <andrewhl> I'm at an impasse.
[22:47:50] <andrewhl> Cork: so simple. Thanks.
[23:12:32] <schrejily> Smackin it up to the bunnified bee!
[23:12:41] <schrejily> Shaqqin it up to the bunnified bee!
[23:13:03] <gry> schrejily: hi. do you have a jquery related enquiry perhaps?
[23:13:06] <schrejily> I mean in ancient times the Egyptians used hard muscle-demanding labor to create large pyramids... and stone age people, the neanderthals, needed to burn 5000-6000 calories a day to survive
[23:13:07] <schrejily> But now people at Amazon use fork lifts, or skyscraper builders use heavy machinery
[23:13:07] <schrejily> heavy machinery by companies like Hitachi or Kabuto or C.A.T. or whatever requires some object movement by people to make but not that of bodybuilders
[23:13:08] <schrejily> But now all weight lifting is good for is police, military, or football/sports players
[23:13:09] <schrejily> Police don't really "contribute" and product to society, but it's always good pay and it's sort of needed
[23:13:09] <schrejily> Military is a waste of time and money
[23:13:10] <schrejily> And football players are like playing video games only in real life
[23:13:10] <schrejily> Throwing a ball around doesn't help other people no matter how much someone is paid
[23:13:10] <schrejily> Police are mostly worthless
[23:13:10] <schrejily> Football is like a virus to the world
[23:13:10] <schrejily> What if I throw your balls around?
[23:13:10] <schrejily> Police don't deter crime
[23:13:12] <schrejily> They just mop up and catch the crooks
[23:13:13] <schrejily> Sometimes
[23:13:13] <schrejily> I look at the future and think: Computers will be obsolete because brain implants will replace them
[23:13:15] <schrejily> Being in shape and having the brain of a computer would mean sitting down would be wasting time.
[23:13:15] <schrejily> But for now, in humanity's evolution, sitting down at a computer or making automated machinery is more productive than bodybuilding
[23:13:17] <schrejily> Do you think in the future body building will be more profitable than sitting at a computer or at a desk?

[23:22:44] <tfittsy> I'm wondering if there is a plugin or a simple way to detect if a keyphrase is typed in on a webpage.  not in a field or anything, just like a listener that if "some phrase" is typed out consecutively and in a certain amount of time it would trigger an event.
[23:28:07] <kurol> tfittsy: like http://paulirish.com/2009/cornify-easter-egg-with-jquery/ ?
[23:31:17] <tfittsy> thanks
[23:33:25] <Nancy2012> how can i add an validation if the name of the select would be an array … ??
[23:33:39] <Nancy2012> for example <select id="languages" multiple="multiple" name="languages[]" class="required" title="- Please select -"></select>
[23:34:40] <Nancy2012> it works when i renamed the name of the select to normal field
[23:35:01] <Nancy2012> for example ---- <select id="languages" multiple="multiple" name="languages" class="required" title="- Please select -"></select>
[23:35:13] <Nancy2012> i am using query validation
[23:35:25] <Nancy2012> how can i validate this array named field ..
[23:35:29] <Nancy2012> many thanks in advance
[23:38:37] <dirkpennings> guys, does someone know a jquery plugin to accomplish a swiping star rating system like the native iPhone music app: http://youtu.be/Z3FzkfLBpe0
[23:42:36] <greg5green> dirkpennings: I don't know of anything already written that will do that, but it shouldnt be that difficult
[23:42:47] <greg5green> are you trying to do it on touch or mouseover? or?
[23:54:56] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/EvXyj/ <-> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/EvXyj/1/ <-- how come this two have diffrent width? look at the Audio-Channels just when i change the text on it it get correct width its the last one thats correct
