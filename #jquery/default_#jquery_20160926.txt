[00:21:43] <nights> hi
[00:21:59] <nights> when using ajax, how do i pass a variable data attribute name?
[00:22:25] <nights> since the data field is not defined using a string , im a bit confused how i can use a variable
[00:22:56] <nights> data{ attribute_name: value }
[00:23:06] <nights> how can i change attribute_name to be a passed string here?
[00:25:54] <nights> ok nm was easy enough
[00:56:51] <hellyeah> yo
[02:53:45] <chealey> How can i set the value of one datepicker to be the same as another?
[02:54:15] <chealey> "after the user manually selects the date of the other"
[02:59:06] <TimCoal> chealey  discover the event on the datepicker for select and how to set the value of a date picker and set it in the event handler
[02:59:30] <chealey> I'm sure I follow you @TimCoal
[02:59:44] <chealey> I'm not* sure
[03:00:02] <TimCoal> have you used events?
[03:00:12] <TimCoal> on click?
[03:00:14] <chealey> no i don't really know what im doing but im trying trial by far
[03:00:19] <XaroRSA_____> var battery = function (canvas, parameters) { this.setValue = function (newValue) {} }
[03:00:20] <chealey> fire*
[03:00:43] <XaroRSA_____> is it possible to test if the battery function has the setValue method?
[03:01:05] <robhol> the question doesn't even make sense
[03:01:21] <XaroRSA_____> mmm let me try again
[03:01:25] <robhol> the function doesn't have a method
[03:01:49] <XaroRSA_____> uhm ok, another function then?
[03:01:51] <robhol> you can check things like "this.setValue" being undefined
[03:06:07] <Cork> XaroRSA_____: is the battery a constructor?
[03:06:14] <Cork> if so, then sure
[03:06:34] <XaroRSA_____> its actually like this
[03:06:59] <Cork> if((new battery).setValue != undefined)
[03:07:14] <chealey> @TimCoal just thought i'd let you know i got it sorted. :)
[03:07:16] <XaroRSA_____> var steelseries = (function () { var battery = function (canvas, parameters) { this.setValue = function (newValue) {} }  }
[03:07:46] <XaroRSA_____> o let me try that cock
[03:07:52] <XaroRSA_____> cork!
[03:07:55] <XaroRSA_____> shit!
[03:07:56] <Cork> XaroRSA_____: that still don't answer what this refers to in that code
[03:07:57] <XaroRSA_____> sorry!
[03:08:14] <Cork> as you don't have anything defining an object
[03:08:18] <chealey> actually apparently i did not :'( it set some other date at random... wtf
[03:08:32] <XaroRSA_____> i initialize it like this
[03:08:37] <Cork> XaroRSA_____: try making a running jsfiddle.net
[03:08:49] <XaroRSA_____> cock ok ill do that
[03:08:57] <Cork> it will be much more efficient then posting fragments here
[03:09:03] <XaroRSA_____> indeed yes
[03:09:05] <Cork> also... learn to use tab completion...
[03:11:05] <skizm> lol wow
[03:32:54] <chealey> How can i set a field to = the SAME as another field (plus 1 hour) ?
[03:33:01] <chealey> (it's a time field obviously)
[03:36:07] <Cork> chealey: is this what you're trying to do? http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#date-range
[03:37:03] <chealey> sorta i just did that for a date field, but now i want to do it for a time field except add 1 hour. So if 5pm is selected for instance, the other field is automatically 6pm
[03:37:22] <Cork> ah, you mean a plain form field
[03:37:36] <Cork> i think you have to parse the input string into a date object
[03:37:50] <Cork> then you can just do date.setHour(date.getHours + 1)
[03:37:53] <Cork> opps
[03:37:55] <chealey> http://jsfiddle.net/queryj/WCuY4/4/   that looks like it should do it right?
[03:41:51] <Cork> chealey: http://jsfiddle.net/WCuY4/75/
[03:42:08] <chealey> Right, thanks. :)
[03:42:18] <Cork> chealey: alternatively i would recommend looking at moment.js
[03:42:25] <Cork> it makes these things much cleaner
[03:42:37] <chealey> im basically basterdizing an existing setup to the fewer plugins i bring into the better.
[03:42:40] <chealey> so*
[03:44:25] <Cork> then you can just do moment($('.mytime').text(), 'HH:mm').add(1,'h')
[03:44:40] <Cork> opps
[03:45:00] <Cork> then you can just do $('.mytime').text(moment($('.mytime').text(), 'HH:mm').add(1, 'h').format('HH:mm'));
[03:45:16] <Cork> (and it would handle the zero padding too)
[03:45:32] <chealey> hmm okay
[03:45:47] <Cork> if one needs to work with time and dates moment is very nice to have
[03:45:59] <chealey> alright i'll check it out
[03:45:59] <Cork> mostly cause the built in date object is fairly shit
[05:04:06] <XaroRSA_____> https://jsfiddle.net/t5pkcawm/
[05:04:14] <XaroRSA_____> following up on earlier
[05:04:43] <XaroRSA_____> just a example, not full code, since library is very big
[05:05:41] <XaroRSA_____> what I want to do is check if 'battery', or 'level' has certain functions
[05:05:42] <Cork> XaroRSA_____: the code doesn't run
[05:06:10] <XaroRSA_____> its not hosted anywhere, no demo site.
[05:06:14] <XaroRSA_____> only on github
[05:06:24] <Cork> XaroRSA_____: jsfiddle can run the code as long as it parses
[05:06:29] <Cork> this doesn't
[05:06:43] <Cork> and it still isn't clear how this reference to anything
[05:07:10] <XaroRSA_____> ok 1 min
[05:08:27] <XaroRSA_____> updating...
[05:08:28] <arnas> hey
[05:08:39] <Cork> XaroRSA_____: send the new url when you're done
[05:08:44] <arnas> http://jsfiddle.net/wQe8c/1178/ how can I prevent user from entering greater date than today?
[05:08:49] <arnas> for example right now I can enter any date I want
[05:08:53] <XaroRSA_____> https://jsfiddle.net/t5pkcawm/1/
[05:09:23] <XaroRSA_____> so there at the bottom of the js, i initialize the gauge with var gauge = steelseries.Linear('canvasLinear1')
[05:09:23] <Cork> arnas: add a validation state when the form is submitted
[05:09:46] <arnas> Cork, it's impossible to do that with the datepicker itself? o.O
[05:09:59] <XaroRSA_____> the 'Linear' becomes dynamic, so that can change to 'battery' or 'level etc
[05:10:05] <Cork> arnas: if you mean prevent the user from typing things in the input field
[05:10:32] <Cork> arnas: yes, cause it isn't a good way to do it (it is always annoying as you can't know what the user intends to do with the text content before submitting)
[05:10:54] <arnas> Cork, I see, thanks
[05:10:59] <XaroRSA_____> each one of those 'linear', 'battery', 'level' have functions that can update values and looks, but they are not the same for each type
[05:11:01] <Cork> for example copying a text string that is two days in the future
[05:11:08] <Cork> and then change the month or something
[05:11:24] <XaroRSA_____> so 'battery' will only have some functions like 'setValue'
[05:11:37] <XaroRSA_____> and 'linear will have others like 'changeFrame'
[05:12:18] <XaroRSA_____> so how can i when dynamicly creating the gauges, test if those functions are available within those 'sub functions' like 'linear', 'battery' , 'level' etc
[05:13:11] <MACscr> well unfortunately i couldnt figure out how to make a full fsfiddle for this test, but im simply trying to match the current url so i can add an active class to its list item. Its for the most part, except when two menu items share the same base. seem for som reason that /index.htm and /index.htm?bar=true is being marked as active when at /index.htm, but when im just on /index.htm?bar=true, its correctly only marks that one as
[05:13:11] <MACscr> [04:12:47]  MACscr:	 active https://jsfiddle.net/upwm3vdf/3/
[05:13:22] <Cork> XaroRSA_____: what is important in that fiddle is line 15780+
[05:13:34] <Cork> XaroRSA_____: it creates an object with the function names
[05:13:41] <Cork> the rest is fairly pointless
[05:17:42] <Cork> XaroRSA_____: the lib is quite convoluted, and there isn't sub objects
[05:17:57] <Cork> it is just one big object and the sub functions modifies the state of the big object
[05:19:26] <Cork> XaroRSA_____: so to check if serValue exist you just have to do if(this.setValue != undefined)
[05:23:59] <XaroRSA_____> mmm i dunno whenever i console out the object
[05:24:05] <XaroRSA_____> i always get the same
[05:30:50] <MACscr> nvm, solved
[06:43:01] <arnas> is it possible to call prevent default on a selection?
[06:49:29] <Cork> arnas: no, but you can set user-select: none in css
[07:09:29] <arnas> I am using jquery ui datepicker. When I select any date from a calendar, it appears in the input field. Is there any event that gets triggered when input field's value changes?
[07:09:46] <arnas> on input doesn't seem to be working here :/
[07:10:48] <Cork> arnas: i think it uses the change event
[07:12:11] <arnas> Cork, true. But then if I type anything into input field, it doesn't trigger that event
[07:13:18] <arnas> Cork, ah, using input and change events worked
[07:13:19] <arnas> thanks!
[07:35:46] <codecutter>       why is this not working?      $('.foo').on('hover',function(){ console.log('foo');});
[07:37:59] <Cork> codecutter: make sure the .foo element exists when you bind the handler
[07:38:34] <Cork> if it doesn't then you need to delegate it to a static parent (or you might have forgotten the ready wrapper: $(function() {})
[07:39:21] <codecutter> wmouseover works but hover fails
[07:39:32] <Cork> make a jsfiddle
[07:39:36] <codecutter> mouseover*
[07:39:55] <codecutter> whats the point, i might as well use that instead
[07:40:15] <Cork> mouseover isn't the same as hover
[07:40:23] <codecutter> whats the diference?
[07:40:31] <Cork> hover takes two event callbacks
[07:40:50] <codecutter> i'm just trying to set a property of css on hover
[07:41:02] <Cork> codecutter: why not just use css?
[07:41:11] <Cork> :hover
[07:41:15] <codecutter> becuase there is a if condition
[07:41:31] <Cork> so control the if case with a class
[07:41:45] <codecutter> "i'd like to set the property element with class .foo to 'display:block' (default is display:none) only if another element with class .boo has the background property. How do i do this using sass?" <-- from eariler
[07:41:49] <Cork> .case-active .... elm:hover {}
[07:44:53] <codecutter> display only only when element with class .bow has a background property set.http://pastebin.com/
[07:46:44] <codecutter> i see
[07:46:45] <Cork> codecutter: i follow, to explain what i meant with the answer is you set the background state with a class
[07:46:54] <Cork> and then you just have to check for that class with css
[07:47:12] <codecutter> yeah, i see what you mean.
[07:47:14] <Cork> basically you want to control as much of the design as possible from css
[07:47:52] <Cork> it is always the best choice as it lets you do web design how the spec designers envisioned it
[07:48:02] <Cork> and it really makes doing things later on MUCH easier
[07:48:14] <Cork> (instead of what many do is move basically all the css into js)
[07:48:40] <Cork> it also results in nice performance as you don't have to loop and parse as much
[07:51:20] <codecutter> Cork: think if i should use data attribite instead
[07:51:33] <codecutter> e.g. data-has-image'"true"
[07:51:47] <codecutter> then i'd need jquery
[07:51:50] <Cork> true/false state isn't a good match for data
[07:51:50] <codecutter> nvm
[07:52:19] <Cork> as firstly it means your selectors will be much slower as you won't hit any of the browsers fast paths
[07:52:44] <Cork> and as you only will store a true/false state that matches exactly what a class is for
[08:32:47] <MrFeedback> when I added a plugin to an element. how can I remove it? added like this $('foobar').fsvs({params: 'param'});
[08:41:32] <z16> Hello kind people
[08:42:27] <z16> In my quest to disable a button given a certain condition I stumbled upon this SO post, which seemed to recommend .prop("disabled", true) over .attr("disabled", "disabled"): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1594952/jquery-disable-enable-submit-button
[08:42:47] <z16> However, I cannot get the .prop method to work in Firefox or Safari (curiously, it does work in IE)
[08:43:15] <z16> The .attr method works everywhere
[08:43:29] <z16> Is that known or am I doing something colossaly wrong?
[08:47:55] <Cork> MrFeedback: there isn't a generic answer
[08:48:15] <hk3380> Anyone knows what's a free library that I can use to display a responsive gallery of images (both landscape and portraits) that may be clicked on to enlarge? Ideally a layout like this: https://i.imgur.com/JciXIGT.jpg
[08:48:23] <Cork> MrFeedback: if the plugin doesn't provide a way to clean up after it, and you can't clean up from externally, you can't do it without reloading
[08:48:46] <Cork> z16: never ever use .attr for setting state
[08:49:15] <z16> Cork: That's the gist I got from reading about it so far (although I've yet to hear a reason for it)
[08:49:23] <Cork> z16: .attr controled dom state up until jquery 1.5, in 1.5+ it won't do what you expect it to do as it only sets the attribute (what the browser sees as a string in the html
[08:49:38] <z16> I'm sorely lacking alternatives at this point
[08:49:58] <z16> Thanks, that gives some context
[08:50:02] <Cork> z16: could you make a small jsfiddle with what breaks?
[08:50:18] <z16> I'll try, sorry if I'm being slow, I'm not a JS dev by any standard
[08:50:28] <Cork> what should happen is jquery 1.5+ should break in ie if you use .attr('disabled', 'disabled')
[08:50:34] <Cork> cause it doesn't liten for attribute changes
[08:50:58] <Cork> while .prop('disabled', true) should work everywhere
[08:55:18] <z16> Hrm, it seems to work in Firefox with JSFiddle... I guess it's about my setup somehow x.x
[08:55:43] <Cork> z16: make sure you use a modern version of jquery (and only one version)
[08:56:03] <Cork> it should be 1.10 or 2.x or 3.x
[08:56:12] <Cork> (sorry i meant 1.10+)
[08:56:34] <z16> We use 2.1.4, apparently
[08:56:53] <Cork> and no duplicate?
[08:57:26] <z16> We use something called jQuery Easing
[08:57:31] <z16> No idea what that is
[08:57:37] <Cork> its for animation
[08:57:42] <Cork> bounching and things like that
[08:57:47] <z16> I see
[08:58:04] <z16> Hrm, I'll keep digging into it
[08:58:08] <z16> Thanks for the ideas
[08:58:12] <Cork> np

[09:02:11] <tryhard> hi
[09:02:23] <tryhard> i have a small doubt regarding conflict resolution
[09:02:27] <tryhard> can anyone help?
[09:02:56] <Cork> tryhard: ask the question not for someone
[09:03:04] <tryhard> ok
[09:03:05] <tryhard> sorry
[09:03:28] <tryhard> so i did var JQ = jQuery.noConflict();
[09:03:39] <tryhard> i can now use JQ instead of $
[09:03:48] <tryhard> but what if i want to revert it back
[09:03:52] <tryhard> after some lines of code
[09:03:56] <tryhard> i need $
[09:04:01] <Cork> window.$ = JQ
[09:04:04] <tryhard> i can do $= JQ right?
[09:04:11] <tryhard> thanks Cork
[09:04:18] <tryhard> i am not an expert
[09:04:22] <tryhard> thanks Cork a lot
[09:04:28] <Cork> tryhard: $ = JQ depends on the scope of where the code runs
[09:04:36] <Cork> window.$ = JQ will always work
[09:04:41] <decx> when would that be the appropriate thing to do
[09:04:52] <tryhard> see
[09:04:57] <Cork> donno
[09:05:03] <tryhard> COrk it should work fine
[09:05:09] <decx> why would you need noconflict for a few lines
[09:05:10] <tryhard> decx
[09:05:13] <Yepp> how do you handle multiple submission? Disabling submit button is not enough
[09:05:28] <Yepp> pressing enter button still submits the form
[09:05:29] <Cork> Yepp: why isn't disabling the button enough?
[09:05:32] <Yepp> tried making inputs readonly
[09:05:38] <Cork> no not if the event is bound correctly
[09:05:39] <Yepp> but they can still click on it and press enter
[09:05:49] <Yepp> Cork? huh? how?
[09:06:00] <Yepp> tried it
[09:06:20] <tryhard> decx, the reason is, I use jQuery and jQuery UI, on my site. I need to integrate a 3rd party script which also uses jquery UI, this causes conflict, but after the 3rd party script, I need my verson back
[09:06:33] <tryhard> Jquery UI does not provice conflict handling
[09:06:35] <tryhard> as i read
[09:06:37] <tryhard> that is why
[09:07:19] <Yepp> Cork? what do you mean if the event is bound correctly?
[09:07:26] <decx> wrap in iife, dont bother with noconflict
[09:07:29] <Cork> Yepp: https://jsfiddle.net/eukhkj71/
[09:07:41] <Cork> i had to write an example so it took a few mins :)
[09:07:48] <Yepp> ohh, sorry
[09:08:10] <Cork> Yepp: as you see the enter key only works the first submit event
[09:08:29] <tryhard> decx, I will do that
[09:08:32] <tryhard> thanks
[09:08:51] <Cork> Yepp: this is why you should never use click events on the button (if that is what you're doing)
[09:09:00] <Yepp> no, i use submit event
[09:09:02] <Cork> well it is one of the reasons
[09:09:04] <Yepp> im updating the fiddle
[09:09:12] <Yepp> i'll try my case here
[09:09:30] <Yepp> ha! reproduced it
[09:09:36] <Cork> Yepp: you will want to do the disabling as soon as possible
[09:09:44] <Cork> to prevent key repeat for example
[09:09:45] <Yepp> Cork: I reproduced my issue
[09:09:50] <Yepp> https://jsfiddle.net/eukhkj71/1/
[09:10:10] <Yepp> how can I prevent with that context?
[09:10:18] <jose3__> Hello, does anyone know if I can get the the amount of days from momentjs as something like "1.7" days?
[09:10:22] <jose3__> vs 2 days
[09:10:31] <Cork> Yepp: https://jsfiddle.net/eukhkj71/2/
[09:10:46] <Cork> Yepp: the selector didn't find the button as it isn't inside the form
[09:11:00] <Yepp> wth
[09:11:24] <Yepp> i don't understand, i'll go back and see my code again and just disable the actual db saving
[09:11:29] <Yepp> hmm
[09:19:05] <decx> jose3__: .fromNow()
[09:25:49] <z16> Cork: Just in case you were wondering, I think I found the reason, although I haven't fully understood it yet
[09:25:58] <z16> We don't actually use buttons, but <a> wrapped in divs
[09:26:21] <z16> And then we use some JS/CSS magic to visually disable it and remove the link
[10:03:09] <Cork> z16: well there is your problem then
[10:03:25] <Cork> z16: there are no disable on a link, so you can't disable the form through it
[10:03:50] <Cork> z16: my recommendation (and i would push quite hard on this) is to use <button> elements and style it to look like your current design
[10:04:06] <Cork> z16: <input type="submit"> is a pain to style, but <button> is fairly easy
[11:34:10] <user_cor_> I have the following set of tables that I am working on making dynamic: https://jsfiddle.net/ru2nn5wd/2/ it consists on 4 divs one on top of the other (time / tense / voice / SVO). The first thing that I would like to do is only show "tense" once any of the radio buttons in "time" are clicked, then only show "voice" once any of the radio buttons in "tense" are clicked, then only show "SVO" once any of the radio button
[11:34:10] <user_cor_> s in "voice" are clicked... generally speaking, how might I go about accomplishing that?
[11:39:53] <Gsham> is there a hover even i can use that will trigger as a click on mobile devices that dont support hover?
[12:19:11] <z16> Cork: I agree very strongly, but judging from experience I'm not sure if my insistance would produce results
[12:19:24] <z16> I'm normally a backend dev and do only server side stuff
[12:19:36] <z16> They only pulled me in because I got nothing to do at the moment :)
[12:19:42] <z16> Thanks for your input
[12:45:47] <igcewieling> I'm trying to turn a collection of jQuery objects into an array to use with sort().   https://jsfiddle.net/rb5v2vyf/      errors will be on the js debugging window.  Does anyone have suggestions?
[12:46:09] <robertmaxrees> why not skip jquery entirely at that point?
[12:48:21] <decx> do you want to sort the table or your data?
[12:48:25] <igcewieling> robertmaxrees: because I'm terrible with Javascript.   If you think it is a better way, I could do that.
[12:48:40] <robertmaxrees> decx has a pretty valid question
[12:48:58] <igcewieling> decx: I want to sort the rows in the table based on the contact field.    if I can get it into an array I should be able to figure out the rest.
[12:49:40] <decx> use jquery .sort and the index of the th you click to target the right element for a and b in your sort
[12:50:02] <decx> then just reattach itself and you sorted your list
[12:50:11] <decx> reappend
[12:50:39] <igcewieling> thanks.  I'd not know about jQuery.sort
[12:51:10] <igcewieling> most of my google results refer to .sortable() which I'm actually using elsewhere,.
[12:51:51] <igcewieling> do you have a link to the docs for the .sort?
[12:52:54] <decx> it's just sort
[12:53:26] <igcewieling> decx: I thought I was using sort.    var new_contacts = contacts.Sort(function (a, b) {
[12:53:26] <igcewieling>         console.log('a');
[12:53:35] <decx> you used Sort
[12:53:56] <igcewieling> now I'm confused.
[12:54:12] <igcewieling> can you give me an example?
[12:55:06] <decx> well have you used sort before?
[12:55:30] <robertmaxrees> fwiw where's no jquery sort function
[12:55:33] <igcewieling> no,.  never needed to.
[12:55:50] <igcewieling> normally all the data is sorted by the time it gets to the browser.
[12:56:38] <igcewieling> this time I tried being clever and uses XSL to generate everything.
[12:56:59] <igcewieling> anyway, thanks for pointing out my case error on Sort .vs. sort
[12:57:34] <decx> also i have this old thing here for you to look at http://jsfiddle.net/decx/cb5fpLzp/
[12:59:42] <igcewieling> thanks.
[13:28:34] <XaroRSA_____> cork u in?
[13:59:41] <jak2000> how to exit from a function?
[13:59:48] <robertmaxrees> you return.
[14:01:07] <bolovanos_> hithere
[14:01:44] <robertmaxrees> good morning
[14:02:27] <bolovanos_> D:\Downloads\smazat\bootstrap\scrollSpyTest\example\scrollspy.html
[14:02:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:02:42] <bolovanos_> brb :)
[14:02:52] <bolovanos_> http://bolovanos.atspace.cc/bootstrapTest/example/scrollspy.html
[14:03:03] <bolovanos_> better
[14:03:04] <bolovanos_> anyway
[14:03:34] <bolovanos_> is there a way to say why "$('.navbar .nav li > a').on('activate.bs.scrollspy', function(e) {" is not being triggered on page scroll
[14:03:59] <bolovanos_> unlike "ScrollSpy.prototype.activate = function (target) {" -> see console for log output
[14:04:07] <bolovanos_> ?
[14:04:23] <bolovanos_> here is the affected js http://bolovanos.atspace.cc/bootstrapTest/example/scrollspy.js
[14:06:07] <robertmaxrees> let's reframe this:
[14:06:14] <robertmaxrees> what's the bug you're trying to fix?
[14:07:01] <bolovanos_> robertmaxrees, http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy-events
[14:07:26] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't answer my question :)
[14:07:28] <bolovanos_> this event should be working, but it is working only if '#myScrollspy' is set to "document"
[14:07:44] <bolovanos_> I know - just preparing materials to clarify problem
[14:07:58] <robertmaxrees> and you're not creating elements dynamically, right?
[14:08:27] <robertmaxrees> ah, i see the issue.
[14:08:32] <robertmaxrees> you're not waiting for document ready.
[14:08:42] <robertmaxrees> the elements don't exist when your code runs.
[14:09:31] <bolovanos_> robertmaxrees, how can you tell - it is experience - or some diagnostic you have made based on something I do not know
[14:09:34] <bolovanos_> ?
[14:09:45] <bolovanos_> btw - thank you - will try it
[14:09:50] <robertmaxrees> your script tag is above the body.,
[14:09:59] <robertmaxrees> and none of your code is inside a document ready.
[14:10:08] <robertmaxrees> the JS runs before the html "exists" in the dom.
[14:10:47] <vitez> hello
[14:11:03] <robertmaxrees> good morning vitez
[14:11:03] <vitez> first time here xD
[14:11:16] <vitez> good night here :D
[14:12:36] <Uhkis> if you're having that much fun from a simple good morning, wait until taplar comes in with his puns!
[14:12:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:20:44] <bolovanos_> robertmaxrees, thank you! - may I have few more question - to this bootstrap jqeury topic, please?
[14:20:52] <robertmaxrees> bolovanos_ feel free to ask.
[14:21:02] <robertmaxrees> bolovanos_ if somebody can answer, they will.
[14:21:07] <bolovanos_> ok
[14:24:43] <bolovanos_> why am I not able to attach event handler to chained descendat elements ".navbar .nav li > a" but ".navbar" || "li" way only?
[14:25:17] <robertmaxrees> huh?>
[14:25:39] <bolovanos_> trying to refer to this http://api.jquery.com/on/
[14:25:56] <robertmaxrees> what section?
[14:26:09] <bolovanos_> $( "#dataTable tbody tr" ).on( "click", function() {
[14:26:19] <robertmaxrees> you're reading that out of context.
[14:26:25] <robertmaxrees> you CAN do that, but it's very inefficient to.
[14:26:44] <robertmaxrees> if you read that entire section, it explains what's going on pretty clearly/.
[14:42:33] <bolovanos_> robertmaxrees, you mean "Delegated events" part?
[14:42:37] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:44:23] <bolovanos_> ok - it is ineffective because it attaches as many handlers as there is descendant elements
[14:44:40] <robertmaxrees> you still didn't read all of it :)
[14:45:08] <robertmaxrees> .on() binds to however many elements you target with $()
[14:45:16] <bolovanos_> An event-delegation approach...?
[14:45:18] <robertmaxrees> delegated listeners, leverage the fact that events bubble.
[14:45:26] <robertmaxrees> no, a non-delegated approach has that problemn.
[14:48:56] <robertmaxrees> i think you're confused :)
[14:49:25] <robertmaxrees> would a simpler example help bolovanos_ ?
[14:49:50] <bolovanos_> yes - maybe :)
[14:51:22] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/72p16asz/1/
[14:53:06] <robertmaxrees> bolovanos_ that make a little more sense?
[14:53:58] <bolovanos_> robertmaxrees, absolutely - thank you :)
[14:55:20] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[15:45:19] <whoisace> Hey guys, need some help here - http://jsfiddle.net/5nuhzm13/ - I'm trying to do a forEach() I'm assuming with URL encoding.
[15:45:56] <robertmaxrees> are you getting that value back as a number or as a string?
[15:46:16] <robertmaxrees> because that's not a valid number
[15:48:06] <whoisace> string
[15:48:25] <robertmaxrees> so http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5nuhzm13/1/ instead?
[15:48:48] <robertmaxrees> still lost about what you''re asking.
[15:49:53] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to get the numbers out of 109.65%7C109.65 ?
[15:50:13] <whoisace> so I'm being returend 109.65|109.65
[15:50:20] <whoisace> but it gets turned into url encoding
[15:50:29] <whoisace> and I'm really just trying to strip the decimal
[15:50:39] <whoisace> so it turns into 10965|10965
[15:50:47] <robertmaxrees> decodeURIComponent
[15:50:50] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5nuhzm13/2/
[15:54:17] <whoisace> robertmaxrees so at the point where it does the replace() it doesn't replace pass |
[15:54:22] <whoisace> only the first digits it reads
[15:55:01] <robertmaxrees> do you want so split that into 2 numbers in an array?
[15:55:04] <robertmaxrees> oor...?
[15:56:31] <robertmaxrees> whoisace because otherwise you'll wind up with a number that has multiple decimals which is weird.
[15:57:36] <whoisace> it seems like I probably will, but to take time into consideration, the end result really just needs to be 10965%7C10965
[15:57:41] <whoisace> literally just removing the decimals lol
[15:57:59] <robertmaxrees> oh, that's easy.
[15:58:28] <whoisace> maybe I put too much thought into it while I was trying to solve it
[15:58:42] <robertmaxrees> you gotta use a global regex match for the first arg to repalce.
[15:58:44] <robertmaxrees> *replace
[15:58:54] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5nuhzm13/3/
[15:59:28] <whoisace> safari is so trash idk why i have it set up as my main browser.
[15:59:45] <whoisace> I'm so bad.
[15:59:49] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:59:55] <whoisace> Thanks, I definitely did put too much thought into it
[16:00:06] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:56:46] <robertmaxrees> well this is an exciting day.
[18:33:21] <NTrash> When performing ajax validation and printing the user's input errors, how do you style the way the error messages appear on the screen?
[18:33:30] <robertmaxrees> CSS
[18:34:07] <NTrash> yes, but how do i get the error message element?
[18:34:48] <robertmaxrees> depends on how you're validating.  If you're shipping the entire form at once, you need something to tie each error message back to a particular element
[19:32:57] <NTrash> After completing ajax validation how do I send the validated data to php via POST method?
[19:33:13] <robertmaxrees> via ajax or...?
[19:34:05] <NTrash> yes?
[19:34:28] <NTrash> via jquery
[19:34:51] <robertmaxrees> you can only do it "via jquery" if you send it via ajax.
[19:34:54] <robertmaxrees> you set the "method" option to POST
[19:35:25] <NTrash> how can i do it via ajax?
[19:35:37] <robertmaxrees> you set the method option to POST.
[19:35:49] <NTrash> on the html form?
[19:35:53] <robertmaxrees> in the ajax call.
[19:36:08] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax() takes an object for everything.
[19:36:12] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[19:36:17] <robertmaxrees> all the options and more info can be found here.
[19:36:32] <NTrash> well im not using the ajax function
[19:36:44] <NTrash> but i am doing validation
[19:36:50] <robertmaxrees> then you can't use jquery to post.
[19:36:58] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to manually submit a form.
[19:37:09] <robertmaxrees> well, rather, jquery can trigger a submit on the form.
[19:37:41] <NTrash> is it with $("#form").submit(); ?
[19:37:46] <robertmaxrees> that's one way, yeah.
[19:37:48] <NTrash> because that doesn't work
[19:38:00] <robertmaxrees> probably because you're preventing default in the validation handler?
[19:39:08] <NTrash> Could you give me some tips please? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e9b21a906931637a4dcd307359e743fe
[19:39:24] <robertmaxrees> are you using jquery validate?
[19:39:28] <NTrash> yes
[19:40:13] <robertmaxrees> should be able to just form.submit() there
[19:40:26] <robertmaxrees> if that doesn't work, make sure you don't have any errors in your console.
[19:40:33] <robertmaxrees> if that's clean, make a fiddle real quick.
[19:43:09] <NTrash> Here's the fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/2bLp44d3/
[19:43:26] <robertmaxrees> that's... not helpful heh
[19:43:47] <robertmaxrees> let me fix that real quick.
[19:44:15] <NTrash> eh sorry
[19:44:25] <robertmaxrees> oh i need the actual html.
[19:44:27] <robertmaxrees> not the php.
[19:44:42] <NTrash> it's all in that page
[19:44:52] <robertmaxrees> there's some PHP in there.
[19:44:55] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2bLp44d3/2/
[19:45:10] <robertmaxrees> reduce down the html section until it's just the relevant bits.
[19:46:49] <NTrash> https://jsfiddle.net/2bLp44d3/3/
[19:47:04] <robertmaxrees> lol let me fix the action.
[19:48:11] <robertmaxrees> does your live site not have a submit button?
[19:48:31] <robertmaxrees> because adding one works: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2bLp44d3/5/
[19:48:38] <NTrash> yh it does
[19:48:47] <robertmaxrees> is that button inside of the form tags?
[19:48:47] <NTrash> must've cut it off by accident
[19:50:15] <NTrash> did you change anything other than the action?
[19:50:32] <robertmaxrees> i added a button tag in the fiddle.
[19:51:15] <NTrash> yh i have a button in my original code
[19:51:25] <robertmaxrees> wasn't there in the version I saw (shrug)
[19:52:06] <NTrash> if the problem is action="<?php echo htmlspecialchars($_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]);?>"
[19:52:18] <NTrash> then i have a big problem
[19:52:23] <robertmaxrees> the js wouldn't see that.
[19:52:30] <robertmaxrees> the JS would see whatever gets rendered out.
[19:53:36] <NTrash> it still doesn't work
[19:53:50] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[19:53:59] <robertmaxrees> dunno what else to tell you at this point.
[19:54:21] <NTrash> getPreventDefault() is deprecated. Use defaultPrevented instead.
[19:54:28] <robertmaxrees> that's a warning.
[19:54:32] <robertmaxrees> you can safely ignore that.
[19:54:36] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you using?
[19:54:38] <NTrash> no errors then
[19:55:26] <robertmaxrees> nothing i can do if i can't see it break.
[19:59:27] <NTrash> Here's an updated jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/2bLp44d3/8/
[19:59:50] <robertmaxrees> can you fix the action to actually be whatever the action is?
[20:00:17] <robertmaxrees> because https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2bLp44d3/9/
[20:00:26] <robertmaxrees> works fien.
[20:07:38] <NTrash> thanks for your help anyway, still working on it
[20:08:09] <robertmaxrees> check to make sure you actually have a url of some kind on the form markup.
[20:09:01] <NTrash> yeah i'm using <form id="form" name="form" action="#" method="POST">
[20:09:29] <NTrash> # because it's on the same page
[20:09:44] <robertmaxrees> try / instead
[20:10:16] <robertmaxrees> actually that won't work lol
