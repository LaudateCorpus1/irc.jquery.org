[00:28:00] <Navetz> hey guys i have a problem with some jquery. I'm trying to have a animation slider effect going on but I can't do it properly maybe one of you could help me. Here is some sample code please help me figure out what i'm doing wrong  http://jsfiddle.net/zrdjG/1/
[00:38:00] <MXBrandon> koosha> If the json file is an external file, you can load it using .ajax()
[00:39:53] <Navetz> anyone have any tips on how to solve my hover animation problem?
[00:39:59] <Navetz> http://jsfiddle.net/zrdjG/1/
[00:43:54] <MXBrandon> navetz> Its essentially flipping back and forth because the mouseenter and mouseleave are happening at the same time as the div moves
[00:44:27] <MXBrandon> You will need to do something like wait to execute the next mouseenter until the mouseleave animation is complete
[00:44:47] <Navetz> MXBrandon, ah so mayble a global variable ?
[00:46:03] <MXBrandon> not really
[00:46:51] <MXBrandon> Well, that would work I guess
[00:47:05] <MXBrandon> You need to test in the mouseenter if the mouseleave is completed yet
[00:47:22] <MXBrandon> But when the mouseleave is complete, the mouse will be in a different div
[00:47:49] <Navetz> so when mouseleave is complete i need to call mouseenter?
[00:50:40] <bjovgyxft> Hi, I have got a div as an 500x600 px area. In this are user can place by mouse click <p> elements. Now my question is, can jq draw svg lines between positions of <P>s? I mean inside div area.
[00:51:33] <MXBrandon> navetz>  http://jsfiddle.net/zrdjG/2/
[00:51:38] <MXBrandon> That should get you started
[00:51:50] <MXBrandon> Basically, you just animate for mouseenter
[00:52:16] <MXBrandon> You should make a container div that goes around ALL of those divs, and put your mouseleave around that
[00:52:28] <Navetz> MXBrandon, Thanks man
[00:52:36] <MXBrandon> Then when the mouse goes from DIV to DIV, it animates it as you wish
[00:52:47] <MXBrandon> And when its not on any of the divs, it deanimates them
[00:52:50] <MXBrandon> make sense?
[00:53:35] <Navetz> MXBrandon, yup, i really appreciate the help :)
[00:54:12] <bjovgyxft> anyone into svg and jq, js?
[00:58:40] <Navetz> MXBrandon, do you know how I could get this kinda effect going? http://nicolahibbert.com/demo/liteAccordion/demo-suite.html#one (just change setting to mouse over). I want it to automatically hop to the one my mouse is hovering over and cancle the rest
[01:00:26] <MXBrandon> Navetz> This should get you started. It needs tweaking, but you will get the idea
[01:00:27] <MXBrandon> http://jsfiddle.net/zrdjG/11/
[01:03:23] <Navetz> thanks ill give it a shot
[01:03:45] <MXBrandon> http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/#mouseover   You could probably use this and tweak the CSS to go vertical instead of horizontal
[01:03:52] <MXBrandon> I gotta run for a bit, bbl
[01:03:55] <MXBrandon> good luck
[02:34:06] <DoubleRainbow> hello world

[03:52:25] <arietis> morning
[03:52:28] <arietis> is it hard to learn jquery in few days? :)
[03:56:13] <beachandbytes> depends to what level of ability you want to learn jquery
[03:56:27] <beachandbytes> if you program you can learn the syntax and concepts pretty quickly
[03:58:42] <arietis> beachandbytes: i do program and i need to write simple code for promo site but i never used javascript, only java/C++/ruby :)
[04:02:07] <arietis> how do i save .js file in safari? :S

[04:31:43] <rgr> any of you fellas tried manipulating the infuriating FB like widget with jq and/or solved the horrendous issue with 157px iframe covering the next element in the dom?
[04:46:46] <mwmnj> Hey all
[04:47:06] <mwmnj> I've recreate my scenario here: http://jsfiddle.net/FgmTS/1/
[04:47:32] <mwmnj> The first click function doesn't work on the dynamically added div
[04:49:51] <beachandbytes> ill look
[04:52:06] <beachandbytes> I'm not seeing a dynamically added div
[04:53:22] <mwmnj> beachandbytes: sorry!
[04:53:25] <mwmnj> Here ya go
[04:53:32] <mwmnj> http://jsfiddle.net/FgmTS/2/
[04:56:20] <mwmnj> beachandbytes: understanding the situation now?
[04:59:34] <bonhoeffer> what is a blur event?
[04:59:52] <beachandbytes> let me see mwmnj one sec
[05:00:27] <mwmnj> beachandbytes: here is my problem al in question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9484295/jquery-click-not-working-for-dynamically-created-items
[05:00:38] <mwmnj> I am going to try this, I think I may have a problem still though
[05:00:51] <mwmnj> because I am using this in the onclick
[05:00:58] <mwmnj> *.click
[05:01:27] <beachandbytes> http://jsfiddle.net/FgmTS/3/
[05:01:29] <beachandbytes> try that
[05:01:33] <geekbuntu> \me /msg NickServ identify imskylikestowiggle
[05:01:37] <geekbuntu> o.0
[05:03:08] <beachandbytes> gotta hate that
[05:03:56] <geekbuntu> good thing all jquery ppl are honest
[05:04:01] * geekbuntu lol
[05:05:33] <mwmnj> beachandbytes: thanks, that works splendidly :)
[05:06:21] <beachandbytes> no problem
[05:06:53] <beachandbytes> for dynamically added objects add the event handler to a parent element that stays static
[05:18:49] <bonhoeffer> how would blur be different than mouseout?
[05:19:24] <beachandbytes> can happen with tabs
[05:19:52] <beachandbytes> blur is oposite of focus
[05:20:00] <beachandbytes> you can mouse over something without giving it focus
[05:21:33] <bonhoeffer> so with a keyboard then?
[05:22:15] <bonhoeffer> if you are only using a mouse, there is only mouseover and not mouseover
[05:22:25] <bonhoeffer> and i guess entering and exiting .. .
[05:22:57] <beachandbytes> no, if you click on an input you give it focus
[05:26:20] <beachandbytes> http://jsfiddle.net/FgmTS/4/
[05:26:22] <beachandbytes> try it
[05:38:40] <vkrishn> in jqueryMobile, is there a way of dynamically creating a collapsible by adding data-role="collapsible" to a div container.
[05:38:41] <vkrishn> maybe by using .data() or $.fn.jqmData() to add data-role=* and then calling create collapsible related functions?
[05:41:46] <starsinmypockets> What tools do folks use for browser compatibility testing?
[05:41:50] <bonhoeffer> beachandbytes, thanks!
[05:42:08] <starsinmypockets> I just built this maverickjetpants.com/slideshow and am trying to vet it...
[05:42:23] <bonhoeffer> wow -- totally makes sense!
[05:42:27] <starsinmypockets> http://maverickjetpants.com/slideshow
[05:58:09] <garann> starsinmypockets: https://browserling.com/ ?
[06:00:39] <starsinmypockets> I linted my js and that helped a bunch - can anyone suggest other low hanging fruit for maximizing browser compatibility
[06:00:46] <starsinmypockets> garann: that's great thankyou
[06:03:32] <garann> sure thing :)
[07:16:29] <christo_m> Hi, i have an autocomplete that populates a div with results.. and I'd like to bind a click event to those li's however they dont exist in the dom in the beginning, so i need some "live" or something equivalent
[07:16:39] <christo_m> However im not sure how it would work in Jquery mobile which is what im using.
[07:16:55] <christo_m> Anyone have an idea how i can do this?
[07:18:47] <christo_m> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/ is the site broken or?
[07:18:51] <christo_m> never used to render like that.
[07:22:43] <beachandbytes> chrome 22?
[07:26:33] <nation> how do i use $.get method to get xml data from asmx page
[08:06:47] <xenaxon> hi
[08:07:08] <xenaxon> I can't get this to work: 		$.delay(1000, function(){
[08:07:34] <xenaxon> is there any reason why it wouldn't execute a function inside it's callback?
[08:14:10] <dhofstet> xenaxon: delay doesn't accept a callback, you probably want to use the setTimeout() function
[08:17:19] <xenaxon> yeah, I figured out in the mean time
[08:17:23] <xenaxon> thanks anyway
[08:17:47] <xenaxon> does anyone know how to change the size of vimeo/youtube videos without the videos flickering
[08:17:59] <xenaxon> I mean, change the size dinamically with jquery
[08:18:37] <xenaxon> I've tried setting .css(width, sizehere), but the videos turn white, and they reload
[08:18:50] <xenaxon> I just want the videos to resize, not reload
[08:25:09] <xenaxon> does anybody have any idea?
[08:31:13] <bonhoeffer> anyone know if you can 'freeze' chrome to copy the css on a hover effect?
[08:31:38] <bonhoeffer> i love the explorer, but i want to copy an effect and when i move the cursor down to copy, I lose it!
[08:32:17] <beachandbytes> bonhoeffer one of the options is change state

[08:49:34] <rgr> hi folks, I was wondering if someone here had experience with the fb plugins in a jq managed environment. I dont think its jq causing my issue but if anyone here would be willing to take a look at a fb plugin issue I have with a hiddne iframe covering later dom elements after a jq append()
[08:49:39] <rgr> maybe you could pm me.
[09:17:40] <blaman> hello guys! I want some code to run after the images on my pages have loaded, and I can't use $(window).load() because I'm pulling them via AJAX. Is there any other way?
[09:20:08] <beachandbytes> blaman document.ready?
[09:20:12] <NodeX> why can't you add somehting to your ajax handler
[09:20:32] <NodeX> if you're pulling them in with ajax then you know when they're ready
[09:21:05] <blaman> beachandbytes: nope, that fires when the DOM is ready, but that does not mean the images have been loaded yet
[09:21:31] <NodeX> https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded .. perhaps that will help
[09:21:47] <blaman> Yeah, I tried that, but it breaks on the android browser for some reason
[09:22:00] <blaman> in chrome is fine though
[09:23:01] <Heather_> how do I collect data from an input to assign to a js var e.g var var1 = $(.cssolector).??;
[09:23:26] <Heather_> selector*
[09:23:48] <NodeX> collect data?
[09:24:08] <Heather_> the user input
[09:24:12] <NodeX> the value?
[09:24:23] <Heather_> yes
[09:24:27] <NodeX> .val()
[09:24:31] <Heather_> thank you
[09:24:39] <NodeX> var foo =  $("selector").val();
[09:25:09] <NodeX> but  be warned that a .class will return an array not a single object
[09:25:33] <Heather_> alright
[09:26:17] <blaman> thanks anyway NodeX and beachandbytes
[09:26:40] <Heather_> so a multidimensional array with one element containing the whole value?
[09:27:47] <Heather_> how about #id selector?
[09:27:54] <Heather_> same story?
[09:29:11] <xenaxon> guys, does anyone know why google maps won't fit to bounds on resize ?
[09:30:07] <xenaxon> if you resize the window too fast, the google maps viewport doesn't resize, and the rest of the google maps frame is white
[09:45:10] <rhizmoe> xenaxon: give it a minute
[10:05:39] <Pymous> Hi ! I'd like to switch from one class to another, but the start class can be different and unpredictable, so switchClass doesn't work here, any other method available ? :)
[10:08:11] <ryanneufeld> Pymous: see ?hasClass
[10:08:12] <bot-t> Pymous, .hasClass(className): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[10:08:46] <ryanneufeld> and see ?removeClass
[10:08:47] <bot-t> .removeClass([className]): Remove a single class, multiple classes, or all classes from each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/
[10:08:54] <ryanneufeld> and see ?addClass
[10:08:55] <bot-t> .addClass(className): Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[10:19:51] <Heather_> whats the best arbitrary html tag for jquery functionality?
[10:19:57] <Heather_> span?
[10:20:03] <manouch> hi...
[10:20:14] <manouch> the jquery animate function breaks my css during the animation
[10:20:20] <manouch> and then fixes it on completion
[10:20:26] <manouch> how can i avoid that?
[10:22:11] <philthetechie> i have an issue with the jquery animation too.
[10:22:40] <philthetechie> the script runs fine once loaded, but FF has to time the script out first, click stop script, then runs perfectly
[10:22:58] <philthetechie> when debugging- is jQuery .offset code
[10:23:22] <philthetechie> Is there any way to avoid an infinite loop crashing out using this?
[10:24:23] <philthetechie> http://jsfiddle.net/rj6ZX/1/
[10:49:41] <arietis> any idea why such code is wrong? https://gist.github.com/7163d5622d8e3b0d3a59
[10:52:56] <jrockjiggz2> arietis: code looks fine..
[10:53:25] <arietis> jrockjiggz2: looks like i'm checking if specific key is pressed wrong
[10:53:49] <jrockjiggz2> 83 = left control
[10:55:10] <rmurphey> arietis: what are you trying to do?
[10:55:29] <arietis> rmurphey: doing some exercise where i should check if s button is pressed
[10:55:50] <arietis> rmurphey: it says i missed check
[10:55:58] <xec> i haven't seen keydown being bound to a LI before, how would that work?
[10:56:12] <rmurphey> xec: that is my question as well :) it works if there's an input inside the li
[10:56:20] <rmurphey> but otherwise ... keydown isn't going to get triggered on an li itself
[10:56:27] <jrockjiggz> wouldn't the LI need to have have focus first?
[10:56:35] <jrockjiggz> which. its kind of impossible
[10:57:03] <rmurphey> arietis: are you trying to determine whether the control key was held when the li was .. clicked?
[10:58:05] <samholmes> On jQuery Mobile: How come my logo in a header role looks fine on iOS, but on android it cuts off on the right edge? How can I make it scale naturally to fit a mobile device of any size?
[10:58:51] <arietis> rmurphey: i'm trying to determine if key is pressed at all
[10:59:52] <xec> arietis: maybe you want to bind to window then ;)
[11:07:25] <rafaa> I noticed that when grunt builds jQuery-UI, it wraps the code in iffe like (function($, undefined){})(jQuery);
[11:07:51] <rafaa> is there a way to customize the build process to use let's say jQuery_1_8_13 instead?
[11:08:06] <rafaa> ie a handler to jQuery.noConflict() ?
[11:08:25] <jrockjiggz> the last big (jQuery), replace that with your noConflict variable
[11:08:41] <jrockjiggz> I use $$$ as jQuery 1.6, so your last bit would be ($$$)
[11:08:55] <jrockjiggz> var $$$ = jQuery.noConflict(true); for exapmle
[11:11:32] <rafaa> jrockjiggz, ok but is there a way to automate the build process?
[11:12:56] <rafaa> I manually changed the occurrences in the files, however it makes more sense to automate this thing in a build process. It makes the whole thing more reliable
[11:13:18] <rafaa> But it seems it's not possible, because every plugin source file manually use jQuery
[11:14:31] <jrockjiggz> jQuery = $$$
[11:14:58] <tw2113> jquery earns people moneys?
[11:16:14] <rafaa> jrockjiggz, what do you mean? Have you understood my question?
[11:17:03] <jrockjiggz> rafaa: possibly not.. i do not know what build process is
[11:17:31] <rafaa> jquery-ui uses grunt, a node-based build tool, to make the final artifact from source files
[11:17:49] <fels-z> can anyone hear me
[11:17:54] <rafaa> manually replacing is error-prone, and must be done again for new versions
[11:17:54] <jrockjiggz> fels-z: ?
[11:18:00] <tw2113> speak up fels-z
[11:18:03] <tw2113> i can't hear you
[11:19:34] <fels-z> CAN ANY ONE .. :) just wanted to know if anyone had experience in JQM + Phonegap
[11:19:42] <jrockjiggz> rafaa: I fail to understand why what grunt builds has todo with what version of jquery you load into the page
[11:22:05] <rafaa> jrockjiggz, I must use a modified jquery-ui file, right? I manually replace /jQuery/$$$/gm , right? I want to know if it's feasible to automate this in the build script, so I can add the thing to the toolchain and better integrate with other developers and SCM, since dependencies (jquery-ui IS a dependency) should not be in source control
[11:22:46] <jrockjiggz2> rafaa: are you attempting to use a custom version of jQuery for ui?
[11:23:37] <rafaa> No, my framework includes, let's say, jQuery 1.4, ok? My modifications need 1.8 and UI, so I'll have 2 jquery loaded
[11:24:06] <rafaa> obviously -UI depends on jQuery, so it has to pick the right one, which in the js namespace is jq_1_8 for example
[11:24:33] <rafaa> so I must modify the -UI sources (or final artifacts) to use jq_1_8 instead of jQuery
[11:24:41] <rafaa> It's the same thing you did with $$$
[11:24:42] <tw2113> see i you can disable 1.4 as old jquery is old
[11:24:56] <jrockjiggz2> are you trying to presenve jQuery as 1.4 ?
[11:25:01] <jrockjiggz2> *preserve
[11:25:32] <rafaa> tw2113, I'm not trying anything.. I'm simply not allowed to change that part. I don't know if it's backword compatible and if it breaks scripts...
[11:26:03] <tw2113> i swear right around the 1.4 timeframe, everything started including their own copy of jquery
[11:26:05] <rafaa> The project is badly designed, there are not test cases, I don't even know how it works :P so non invasive updates are welcome...
[11:26:13] <tw2113> it's like this lingering ghost
[11:26:35] <rafaa> yep..
[11:26:44] <tw2113> i want to say spend the time to upgrade the jquery version and fix what bugs show up
[11:30:26] <jrockjiggz2> rafaa: i was thinking something like this..  http://jsfiddle.net/tB7XH/
[11:32:13] <rafaa> jrockjiggz, yeah! I didn't think of it :)
[11:58:19] <hotch> using $.when any idea why my jqXHR responseText is undefined but i can see it in my results object? http://pastebin.com/UTMyfApE
[11:59:30] <DeltaHeavy> How come with I run a text field's value through console.log I get it's value, followed by 'undefined' underneath it?
[11:59:38] <DeltaHeavy> console.log($('#something').val());
[12:00:44] <DeltaHeavy> It's printing out as undefined too when I try to use those values as a part of a string.
[12:03:50] <hotch> anyone? where queue is an array of two ajax calls. $.when(queue).done(function(results) { … results[0] looks like it gives me back an xhr response? so logging results[0] i see that, but even when i inspect the log and see responseText, i get undefined for results[0].responseText;
[12:18:43] <rmurphey> hotch: i'm not sure that when works with an array ... you may need to use $.when.apply if you have an array
[12:19:25] <hotch> k
[12:26:29] <eizdealer> hey guys, i'm using jquery ui for the first time, trying out the autocomplete but receiving the following error: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'zIndex' — jquery.ui.autocomplete.js:204
[12:26:42] <eizdealer> can anyone hint me at what might be wrong here?
[12:27:15] <ravenzz> expand the error message, and see what the error stack is
[12:27:30] <eizdealer> i have all the dependencies scripts and they should be in the correct order: jquery, ui core, position, widget, autocomplete
[12:27:31] <ravenzz> you should see where in your code is the error
[12:27:39] <eizdealer> ok just a sec
[12:28:08] <eizdealer> http://nopaste.info/f3b5f63884.html
[12:28:27] <eizdealer> sounds like jibberish to me ^^
[12:29:18] <ravenzz> (anonymous function) lifts:54 ?
[12:29:50] <ravenzz> paste your code as well
[12:31:15] <eizdealer> http://nopaste.info/f9b7270b71.html
[12:31:20] <eizdealer> this is just the relevant part
[12:31:43] <eizdealer> lifts:54 is line 28 in this file
[12:34:16] <eizdealer> it's weird that it gets this far before producing the error
[12:36:11] <hotch> rmurphey: that doesn't work. i get an empty response.
[12:36:14] <hotch> []
[12:40:06] <eizdealer> ravenzz: lol it gets even weirder, i tried the code on another machine in IE instead of chrome, it produces a different error at a different location
[12:40:25] <ravenzz> eizdealer try with this markup http://pastie.org/4867189
[12:41:29] <ravenzz> or give me a link to the page on which you are experiencing the issue, or reproduce it on jsfiddle.net
[12:42:53] <ravenzz> hotch more code less words :o
[12:44:21] <blaman> ugh I'm still stuck... so, apart from the waitForImages plugin, there's no other way to run code when all images have loaded? (can't use window.load() as I'm pulling pages with ajax)
[12:47:03] <hotch> ravenzz: I posted the code. I'm more of a backend promises guy. Sorry that I don't keep up to date on breaking changes with jquery
[12:47:06] <hotch> (dick!)
[12:52:04] <ravenzz> hotch sorry I missed it
[12:52:59] <hotch> np. so now answer my question ! :)
[12:54:26] <noregret> is there such thing as referrer url in ajax ?
[12:54:28] <ravenzz> have you tried looping the array?
[12:55:31] <hotch> yes.
[12:55:37] <ravenzz> queue.each(function () { $.when($(this)).done(); })
[12:55:37] <ravenzz> ?
[12:55:50] <ravenzz> this sorry
[12:56:13] <hotch> new to jquery promises
[12:56:19] <hotch> so as far as results?
[12:56:23] <rmurphey> hotch: http://jsfiddle.net/rmurphey/V6Ldp/
[12:56:25] <hotch> isn't .done the end point of my promise?
[12:56:29] <ravenzz> or apply might work
[12:56:36] <ravenzz> as rmurphey said
[12:56:44] <rmurphey> apply works
[12:56:57] <rmurphey> you can see that the function passed to then gets an array back
[12:57:01] <rmurphey> and the array contains two more arrays
[12:57:06] <ravenzz> it is quite silly
[12:57:10] <ravenzz> imho
[12:57:24] <ravenzz> because you don't actually need to change the context
[12:57:32] <ravenzz> so a loop would be fine
[12:57:43] <rmurphey> hotch: http://jsfiddle.net/rmurphey/V6Ldp/1/ is better
[12:57:58] <rmurphey> a loop is not fine if you want to wait for both to be done before handling the responses
[12:58:18] <rmurphey> and, correction, the function does not get an array back
[12:58:24] <rmurphey> it gets two arguments back, each of which is an array
[12:58:59] <rmurphey> in the example at http://jsfiddle.net/rmurphey/V6Ldp/1/, you can get the result1 response text with result1[1]
[13:03:30] <hotch> great thanks rmurphey
[13:04:06] <hotch> it would seem obvious to have the ability to pass in an array of ajax calls :)
[13:08:09] <noregret> if i made an ajax call, will the browser save the called URL as a referer ?

[14:45:03] <manouch> hi... jquery's animate function breaks the css during the animation (just extending the width of an element)
[14:45:15] <manouch> what i can i do?
[14:49:20] <xec> manouch: breaks? how
[14:50:08] <manouch> xec: it appears to adjust the floating
[14:50:21] <manouch> don't know how to debug this so that i can tell you more
[14:50:24] <manouch> i'll try sth
[14:50:32] <xec> manouch: can you reproduce the behaviour in a fiddle?
[14:51:48] <manouch> xec: okay, gimme 10 minutes
[15:02:15] <manouch> xec... looks like the problem is that jquery animate set "overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden; " to the element
[15:03:54] <manouch> found this solution: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/2648
[15:05:07] <manouch> works like a charm with "overflow: visible !important;" now
[15:08:14] <jenia_> hello everyone
[15:08:28] <jenia_> how can i unhighlight the current day in the jquery datepicker
[15:08:48] <jenia_> the 29 of september will be highlighted for me even though i pick another day
[15:09:12] <jenia_> tomorrow the same thing will happen with the 30 of september
[15:09:19] <jenia_> how can i change that?
[15:11:04] <sonotos> jenia_: well it's the actual date which is preselected
[15:11:50] <jenia_> yea
[15:11:56] <jenia_> how can i unselect it
[15:12:33] <kiyoura> Say i have HTML in a document p: <p>Text Here</p>. Is there a jQuery plugin that allows me to access encapsulate each character inside p to a jQuery object (for example turning each char into <span>t</span>)
[15:13:01] <kiyoura> wops, allows me to encapsulate*
[15:14:31] <xec> kiyoura: iirc supplying a string to $.each() lets you loop each character
[15:15:49] <kiyoura> xec: but that doesn't return each character as an individual jquery object such that i may apply additional animations/properties to it
[15:16:15] <sonotos> jenia_: hm well i don't see any method, but you could remove the class "ui-state-default" after opening the datepicker overlay
[15:16:27] <xec> kiyoura: you get each char available, you can do what you want with it...
[15:16:32] <jenia_> oh okay nice idea thanks
[15:17:32] <kiyoura> xec, i dont want the characters as a string. hence why i said plugin; i know of linear operations. i want to additionally say per 1 character, do char[0].css({})... etc
[15:17:57] <kiyoura> essentially, i want to access each character via the DOM, if that's possible
[15:18:28] <xec> for what purpuse?
[15:18:54] <kiyoura> that doesn't really matter, im creating an animation lib
[15:20:11] <xec> ok, well, no. you can't animate each char individually, but you can easily wrap them first as you asked about
[15:20:30] <kiyoura> i thought so, how would i do that?
[15:20:40] <kiyoura> i know of wrap()
[15:20:44] <xec> use $.each() ?
[15:20:54] <kiyoura> $.each() + wrap() ?
[15:21:24] <kiyoura> what im seeing is the problem, xec, if i use each and it only returns the letters as a string..how would it know of its DOM position?
[15:21:53] <xec> sure, wrap works. string manipulation is probably more efficient though
[15:22:25] <xec> kiyoura: if you tell me what you're trying to do maybe you can get more specific answers ;)
[15:22:52] <xec> if you wrap each letter in an element you got them available as DOM elements...
[15:23:09] <kiyoura> xec, in software design an implementation is independent of its abstract interface
[15:23:22] <kiyoura> as ive said it doesn't matter, and i'll be creating the lib as such
[15:23:51] <xec> ok. i just really don't see what you're struggling with here
[15:24:04] <kiyoura> 1 sec
[15:24:56] <kiyoura> xec http://pastie.org/4867782 doesn't work as expected
[15:25:58] <xec> ok, well "first" is a character here, right? what do you expect $("a") would do, for instance
[15:26:13] <kiyoura> ya, i know
[15:26:19] <kiyoura> so what /should/ be done, then?
[15:26:27] <kiyoura> to do as ive described
[15:26:35] <kiyoura> $.each does the trick?
[15:26:52] <xec> how about $('<span>'+letter+'</span>')
[15:27:20] <kiyoura> xec, but that's not in-place, is it?
[15:28:17] <xec> correct. each letter is not available through the dom (except as read-only through array notation on strings)
[15:28:29] <xec> so you'd need to replace the content
[15:28:45] <kiyoura> xec, so i may have to actually /rewrite/ the DOM so that each char IS accessible
[15:29:03] <kiyoura> i.e. <p>text</p> = <p> <span>t</span> .... </p>
[15:29:06] <xec> depending on what you are trying to do
[15:29:58] * kiyoura isn't disclosing what he's doing cause the outcome may possible be awesomesauce
[15:30:07] <kiyoura> possibly*
[15:30:28] <kiyoura> ty xec that answers my question :)

[15:34:13] <fels-z> how to make JQM Page landscape
[15:34:19] <macmartine> At the bottom of this http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.1.js I see window.jQuery being set. Where is it in here http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.2.min.js ? I'm trying to change the variable name so I can reference it by something other than 'jQuery'.
[15:35:22] <xec> macmartine: i recommend you don't change the jquery lib itself (makes for nightmares when you want to upgrade)
[15:35:35] <xec> macmartine: have you looked at the noconflict method?
[15:35:47] <macmartine> xec: He's the explanation http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12654593/loading-a-second-version-of-jquery-and-other-libraries-along-with-it
[15:35:51] <macmartine> *Here's
[15:36:34] <M4d3L> what is the jquery function to update live when we add stuff in a field?
[15:37:28] <xec> macmartine: tl;dr - was that a "yes" or a "no"?
[15:37:32] <xec> :)
[15:38:12] <macmartine> xec: what, noconflict? Yes, I've looked at it. My question I linked to explains why it doesn't work
[15:39:35] <macmartine> xec: never mind, I figured it out
[15:50:42] <jenia_> i cant do it.
[15:51:11] <jenia_> can someone please refer me to a tutorial on how to unselect the today's date in the datepicker
[15:51:15] <jenia_> when the user has pressed another date
[15:53:56] <ccorker> Is that question for jQuery UI?  If so, it looks like that problem might be a bug they haven't fixed yet.
[15:53:56] <ccorker> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8159
[15:54:08] <xboi209> how can i append some text to the value attribute of an input element?
[15:55:09] <ccorker> jenia_ there's also a workaround where they just remove the active class based on certain parameters.
[15:55:09] <ccorker> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3840151/jquery-datepicker-how-to-disable-auto-day-selection-while-browsing-calendar
[15:55:25] <jrockjiggz2> $('input').val( $('input').val() + 'some Text' );
[15:56:10] <xboi209> oh wow
[15:56:12] <xboi209> thanks dude
[15:56:26] <xboi209> i was using the .append method but it didn't add to the value attribute
[15:56:32] <xboi209> >.>
[15:56:48] <bubu> read the doc for append ;)
[15:57:31] <xboi209> well
[15:57:38] <xboi209> i did try it on a textarea b4
[15:57:39] <xboi209> and it worked
[15:57:44] <xec> xboi209: if you're working with the native dom element you can just do .value += "whatever"
[15:57:46] <xboi209> so i just thought it would do the same for input
[15:59:34] <bubu> textarea has a closing tag, input does not
[16:00:33] <xboi209> in xhtml strict, it does i think
[16:01:09] <bubu> so you cant append (which adds a child element) to an empty element
[16:01:38] <xboi209> yeah that's where i got it wrong
[16:07:23] <bubu> if im making an AJAX call to delete something, is it common to do so as a GET or POST?
[16:07:39] <bubu> or does it not matter?
[16:08:07] <fels-z> how do I reload a JQM Mobile page
[16:08:09] <xec> how about DELETE
[16:12:33] <bubu> i guess you shouldnt be using GET to make any changes to the server
[16:14:05] <w00tner> i  use POST
[16:15:16] <w00tner> parse the fields in the ajax post name:$("#name").val(), and then i get it with php $name = stripslashes(strip_tags($_POST['name']));
[16:15:31] <bubu> "DELETE" perhaps makes it more RESTful
[16:15:39] <Heather_> tryin to figure out how to use jsfiddle. How do i apply multiple js files in the javascript box? Add them after each other?
[16:19:46] <rmurphey> Heather_: you can either link to them using <script> tags in the html section, or just paste them sequentially in the js section
[16:20:45] <rmurphey> generally, though, you want to use jsfiddle to make a reduced test case, so the fewer js files involved, the better
[16:22:00] <xec> you can add javascript files under "add resources"
[16:22:28] <rmurphey> also that

[17:13:24] <pensive612> Can someone help give me some insight to the way jQuery iterates through .each() in a plugin?
[17:14:20] <rmurphey> pensive612: how do you mean?
[17:14:24] <pensive612> I've created a plugin for duplicating elements for rapid prototyping.  But am having issues if the cloned elements are nested.
[17:14:30] <pensive612> *thx :rmurphey
[17:14:40] <diverdude> how can i check if an object is a jquery object?
[17:14:45] <pensive612> http://jsfiddle.net/adamin/u46Ps/3/
[17:15:03] <pensive612> I basically iterate through any element that has a data-attribute of 'data-clone'
[17:15:33] <pensive612> which works great on any element.  but if it has 2 that are nested, it only will clone the top level element.
[17:16:18] <pensive612> :diverdude, you should be able to use instanceof
[17:16:31] <dogmatic69> diverdude: how about google? 'check if object is jquery'
[17:16:43] <dogmatic69> first result is SO with 100 votes on the answer.
[17:17:33] <MrJones> hi
[17:17:52] <pensive612> as far as the each(), i feel if iterated from the bottom up. it would work fine.  but i'm guessing that's not how it behaves.
[17:18:42] <MrJones> alert($(".myclass").html()); yields the expected result (so the selector appears to be working), but $(".myclass").css("position:relative"); does: NOTHING (firefox DOM inspector and both visual inspection confirm that css was not applied), no JS exception, no error, no nothing
[17:19:08] <MrJones> is there a) an obvious point of failure here or b) a way to make this assert/throw an exception when applying the css failed so I can see what happens?
[17:20:16] <pensive612> check your syntax :MrJones for CSS.
[17:20:23] <pensive612> it should have a comma separating.
[17:20:38] <MrJones> position;relative?
[17:20:52] <MrJones> that doesn't look right to me...
[17:21:02] <MrJones> or do you mean a terminating ; ?
[17:21:21] <pensive612> .css('position','relative')
[17:22:04] <MrJones> oh wait what?
[17:22:15] <MrJones> oh sorry :) I completely misused the css() syntax then
[17:22:33] <MrJones> I have css('z-index:999'); somewhere else in the code, so I assumed that was the correct way to use it - but that's probably faulty aswell then
[17:22:36] <MrJones> thanks :)
[17:22:51] <pensive612> no problem...
[17:23:09] <pensive612> anyone have an idea for my issue?
[17:24:17] <jrockjiggz2> pensive612: your clone() will include all nested elements
[17:25:37] <pensive612> thanks for checking it out jrockjiggz2, but if you click run, you'll see it will clone the inside correctly.  and the outside container.  but none of the other clone containers, have the newly created elements from the first.
[17:25:55] <bonhoeffer> does setting aria-hidden, set display to none or block?
[17:26:14] <bonhoeffer> currentDropPanel.setAttribute('aria-hidden', 'false'); <-- this code seems to be doing that
[17:26:14] <pensive612> *i know that sounds really confusing.  but in the fiddle.  the 2 cloned tables, should also contain the 4 cloned elements.

[18:44:16] <shoky> [03:34:34] <shoky> diverdude: an easy fix would be to change that to allImg = allImg.add(...)  same for the allImg_thumbs one
[18:44:16] <shoky> [03:34:37] <shoky> diverdude: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/zAx3r/7/
[18:45:02] <shoky> (i was referring to your first fiddle)
[18:45:09] <shoky> didnt lok at the 2nd
[18:45:38] <shoky> diverdude oh you were caught on the bad side of the split, gotcha :P
[18:47:04] <diverdude> shoky: yeah...i got detached :/ mmm its not really working i think: http://jsfiddle.net/pV8bz/5/
[18:47:23] <shoky> diverdude:  allImg = allImg.add( ...
[18:47:49] <diverdude> ah
[18:48:02] <diverdude> yeah ok...sry
[18:48:06] <diverdude> that works
[18:48:17] <shoky> your plugin code is a mess
[18:48:27] <diverdude> shoky: what is wrong with it?
[18:48:27] <shoky> you should follow Eviltwin's suggestion, not mine
[18:48:57] <diverdude> mm ok...i did not see his suggestion :/
[18:49:35] <shoky> i pasted it for you
[18:49:54] <diverdude> oh...read authoring
[18:50:01] <diverdude> heh
[18:50:38] <diverdude> shoky: is there any way to specify the index to which the element inserted when using add(...) ?
[18:50:54] <shoky> diverdude: it's best not to mess with indexes at all :\
[18:51:18] <shoky> anyway if you have an array you can .splice it
[18:52:02] <diverdude> shoky: i know...its because i need to be able to do like showimage(number)..so i need to know the position of the image
[18:52:02] <shoky> you coulda done allImg = whatever.detach().get();
[18:52:12] <shoky> which would just get you a real array instead of a jq obj
[18:52:23] <shoky> then you could do all the awkward error-prone indexing stuff you want
[18:53:02] <diverdude> shoky: yes ok... but is there another better way if i need to show a certain index?
[18:53:18] <shoky> diverdude:  .get()  gets you a real array out of a jq obj
[18:53:28] <shoky> you can do any indexing shit you want with it like in your original fiddle
[18:54:09] <shoky> diverdude: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/pV8bz/7/
[18:54:15] <shoky> just added .get()
[18:54:39] <diverdude> shoky: thanks :) i appreciate it a lot
[19:08:43] <pensive612> Hey shoky!  Thanks so much, that's a great way to look at it, and iterate from the bottom up!
[19:24:37] <pensive612> Hey shoky, as i'm looking further at the code.  Doesn't changing this.each() into $.each() make the plugin no longer chainable?
[19:34:28] <jessetaylor> just recoded my site to use pushState, load stuff dynamically, animate things, and have the back/forward button remember the animations while keeping seo tight. http://www.jessetaylor.ca what do you think?
[19:43:20] <shoky> pensive612: yes sorry, overlooked that. so just 'return this' at the end
[19:46:18] <shoky> pensive612: you could also actually keep it with $().each and no need for the .get() - http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/u46Ps/13/
[19:50:47] <jessetaylor> just recoded my site to use pushState, load stuff dynamically, animate things, and have the back/forward button remember the animations while keeping seo tight. http://www.jessetaylor.ca what do you think?
[19:54:54] <Pochacco> the navigation is kind of confusing
[19:55:16] <Pochacco> from a design stand point it seems kind of cluttered
[19:57:13] <Pochacco> if I go to about then click projects nothing comes up
[19:58:52] <Pochacco> Bad seo
[20:05:22] <diverdude> shouldn
[20:05:57] <CodesStuff> god I wish JS had multithreading capabilities
[20:06:07] <diverdude> shouldn't this $(self).find('#myelm).empty().append(allImg_thumbs), first remove all nodes inside #myelm and then add allImg_thumbs ?
[20:06:16] <CodesStuff> I'm really surprised it isn't a standard yet what with all the js-heavy webapps/html5 games =
[20:06:17] <CodesStuff> =\
[20:09:51] <snover> CodesStuff: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Using_web_workers
[20:11:08] <jessetaylor> Pochacco: fixed the about link, forgot about the nav one
[20:11:24] <jessetaylor> whats bad about seo
[20:26:39] <chare> how does this site get an icon in the browser tab http://stockfishchess.org/
[20:27:59] <Eviltwin> ?g favicon @ chare
[20:28:00] <bot-t> chare, Favicon - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon
[20:28:18] <Eviltwin> They are by far not the only ones
[20:28:21] <chare> I'm looking at the source html and i can't figure out where
[20:28:38] <Eviltwin> Read that wiki page
[20:29:23] <chare> the html has nothing like that in their webpage
[20:29:53] <jessetaylor> search for favicon.ico
[20:30:16] <chare> look at the source for http://stockfishchess.org/
[20:30:19] <chare> i'm telling you its not there
[20:30:21] <chare> its magical
[20:31:19] <Eviltwin> I know exactly how it works
[20:31:32] <Eviltwin> And that article should explain it
[20:33:00] <chare> there is no link rel="icon" or rel="shortcut icon"
[20:33:39] <chare> OH SHIT THE FAVICON.ICO ROOT
[20:33:39] <jrockjiggz> you dont need code. just plop the .ico in root dir, the browser tends to figure it out
[20:34:53] <jessetaylor> depends on how cool the browser is
[21:04:04] <pensive612> :shoky, i love that.  thanks again so much for your time.  very clean and i totally learned something new from it.
[21:05:06] <jessetaylor> http://www.jessetaylor.ca what do you think of my use of pushState
[21:09:07] <jrockjiggz> jessetaylor: smooooth
[21:10:22] <jessetaylor> jrockjiggz: thanks ive been working on it all day. dynamically loads it all, but hardcoding everything on each refresh so seo picks it up, but only the current post is in the code, rest is grabbing the template dynamically
[21:11:01] <jessetaylor> i got the animations hooked up to the onpopstate so the back and forward buttons remember
[21:11:27] <jessetaylor> its the future of front end development, html5 history api is crazy stuff
[22:42:32] <appel> i hate favicon
[22:47:26] <kurol> do you really hate favicon, or are you just saying it because you saw it?
[22:49:35] <appel> I'm writing apps for Opera on set-top-boxes
[22:49:48] <appel> and Opera automagically requests a favicon.ico file from the server
[22:49:56] <appel> without any code requesting it
[22:50:05] <kurol> i know firefox does that too
[22:50:22] <appel> and you know what happens on some set-top-boxes if the server doesn't answer with a favicon.ico file?
[22:50:27] <kurol> because i can see it in my python -m SimplyHTTPServer logs every minute wheeee
[22:50:34] <appel> opera displays a big error page
[22:50:50] <kurol> haha
[22:51:26] <appel> but you have no way of adding a favicon.ico file to the servers root, just because of how things are arranged
[22:51:31] <kurol> what happens if you do a link[rel=shortcut icon] thingy to someone else's favicon?
[22:51:32] <appel> retarded
[22:52:04] <appel> well, the stb's run inside a walled garden
[22:52:07] <appel> so no access to internet
[22:52:22] <kurol> i wonder if you can give it a data uri
[22:52:23] <appel> but yes, you'd need to add a favicon definition into all the html files
[22:52:42] <appel> to override the default favicon get on the servers root path
[22:53:03] <appel> so yes, i hate favicon
[22:53:37] <appel> not because they aren't cool, because browsers request them by default
[22:54:08] <appel> and browsers that request data that you didn't want it to request should be shot on sight
