[06:32:43] <kelvinnn> hi guys, if i am running a $.post inside a for loop (basically i'm looping from page 1 to 10), but based on the post response (for example, if page shows result of "STOP"), i want to break out of the looping. how would i do it? the for loop is synchronous and keeps running, but the $.post is async...
[06:32:59] <Woet> kelvinnn: you can't.
[06:33:12] <Woet> kelvinnn: unless you invent time travel.
[06:33:36] <kelvinnn> @Woet lol! i tried to use promises to resolve this but i can't seem to wrap my head around it
[06:34:10] <kelvinnn> what would be a better way to structure it then? instead of a for loop
[06:34:33] <Woet> kelvinnn: tell us what you're trying to do
[06:35:33] <kelvinnn> basically, im crawling pages using POST, starting from page 1, until page X (keep incrementing). if it receives a result of "STOP", it stops crawling the next page.
[06:38:39] <kelvinnn> wait. would this work with recursion?
[06:39:10] <kelvinnn> start(0,max).. and within start, increment counter till max?
[06:39:22] <AdamPDotty> to understand recursion you first have to understand recursion
[06:45:36] <Woet> kelvinnn: so start the next crawl once you get the result from the first
[06:45:51] <Woet> $.post -> success: function() -> $.post -> success: function()
[06:45:52] <Woet> etc
[06:59:08] <AyCWinner> Trying to check if current tab is opened. if ($(window).is(":focus")) doesn't seem to work. Suggestions?
[07:31:47] * AdamPDotty tries to imagine work in a tab that is not opened. â€¦
[08:28:37] <Dro> Hello, I'm trying to do $('#divId').hide() in $('iframe').on('load') action, but it does not work, $('iframe #divName') is always empty
[08:28:51] <Dro> even with $('iframe').contents().find('#divName')
[08:28:53] <Dro> any idea?
[08:39:53] <Uhkis> Dro: show the code
[08:41:48] <Uhkis> something like $('iframe').on('load', function() { $(this).contents().find('#divName'); }); should work
[08:48:38] <Dro> Uhkis: here is the function i'm trying https://jsfiddle.net/8jxvry4c/
[08:49:25] <Dro> and in my html I have an <iframe src="http://intern-url-here" ... ></iframe>
[08:50:00] <Dro> Uhkis: the first console.log show my iframe, the second one is length 0
[08:51:38] <Dro> in my navigator the iframe contains div.. but maybe the function is running before iframe completly load?
[09:06:21] <Uhkis> Dro: there's that html box for a reason
[09:07:56] <Dro> Uhkis: in fact my iframe url is internal, it won't appear
[09:10:20] <Uhkis> Dro: https://jsfiddle.net/8jxvry4c/6/
[09:18:17] <Dro> Uhkis: same issue in that example if u noticed, the second logged object is empty (Length 0)
[09:18:54] <SlimmyJimmy> Are there still only 2 easings with the base jQuery API?
[09:22:55] <Uhkis> Dro: if your irame on the same domain?
[09:23:13] <Uhkis> Dro: that same exact thing works fine on local server
[09:23:34] <Dro> Uhkis: it worked with u in wikipedia example ?
[09:24:05] <Dro> Uhkis: in my console I have a first object (iframe) and second object empty
[09:24:17] <Uhkis> Dro: when trying locally with local iframe
[09:24:46] <Uhkis> same code, but iframe content on same domain
[09:25:04] <Dro> Uhkis: what in case its not a same domain? this case for example ?
[09:27:23] <Uhkis> Dro: i don't follow. but i meant <iframe src="file.html"></iframe>
[09:27:37] <Dro> Uhkis: I understand u
[09:27:56] <Dro> I'm looking for a solution in case if the iframe is src="http://www.wikipedia.org"
[09:28:50] <Uhkis> that needs some headers from the server
[09:30:01] <Uhkis> actually even more, it's a real pita
[09:34:44] <Dro> Uhkis: so we can't manipulate a div loaded with iframe ?
[09:38:18] <Uhkis> Dro: not cross-domain without some shenanigans, you need control over the framed page
[09:38:28] <Uhkis> Dro: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9393532/cross-domain-iframe-issue
[10:56:01] <AdamPDotty> I was innocent, said the door, I was framed.
[11:01:24] <timetrex> hi
[11:02:43] <timetrex> I'm using 3.2.3. I'm setting html to an element and referecing that element by it's selector from the DOM. leaflet says it doesn't exist. html() is synchronous, isn't it? can anyone offer some insight please?
[11:09:53] <anill> hi
[11:10:35] <anill> i wanted to open video in pop up window using java script, how can i do that
[11:12:03] <anill> i have a webpage that displays some video files, when i click on one of the video file, it opens in same page, i want it to open up in new tab
[11:12:16] <anill> i have a webpage that displays some video files, when i click on one of the video file, it opens in same page, i want it to open up in new pop up window
[11:15:17] <timetrex> this can be achieved with just html.
[11:15:22] <timetrex> ...
[11:16:03] <pavonia> timetrex: What do you mean by "I'm setting html to an element"?
[11:26:56] <artie> hey guys - I am using bootstrap and need to use resizable for images. The images should be able to resize freely and without spacial limitations. Will this break the responsiveness of the web page? How can I make the resized images scale alongside the rest of the web page?
[11:29:29] <timetrex> \q
[13:32:55] <lilalinux> Is it possible to navigate to some url with jquery and add headers to the request?
[13:33:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:33:11] <robertmaxrees> nope on both fronts.
[13:33:44] <robertmaxrees> lilalinux why are you trying to tamper with requestsd?
[13:33:46] <robertmaxrees> *requests
[13:34:00] <lilalinux> I want to add an Authorization: Bearer header
[13:34:06] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:34:14] <robertmaxrees> why?
[13:34:26] <lilalinux> because the resource requires it
[13:37:01] <robertmaxrees> are you using oauth?
[13:37:20] <lilalinux> You can do that with $.ajax (eg. with beforeSend : auth)
[13:37:22] <lilalinux> yes
[13:38:06] <robertmaxrees> right
[13:38:08] <robertmaxrees> that's ajax though.
[13:38:12] <robertmaxrees> bot standard page requestys.
[13:38:20] <lilalinux> It would be great, if the basic auth mechanism could be used for that
[13:38:34] <lilalinux> browsers already support that anyway and send the Authorization header automatically
[13:38:35] <robertmaxrees> *not standard
[13:39:21] <lilalinux> too bad
[13:40:02] <robertmaxrees> errr
[13:41:32] <lilalinux> I'd do it with ajax, but that leaves the url to 'login'
[13:42:00] <robertmaxrees> it seems like you're conflating api requests with page requests.
[13:48:34] <lilalinux> I want to abandon form login in favor of oauth, so I have only one mechanism for mobile apps and web apps.
[13:48:44] <lilalinux> spring form login that is
[13:48:48] <robertmaxrees> ok?
[14:51:28] <robertmaxrees> if wonder if xarg will ever figure out their username issues.
[14:51:37] <overflowPaul> Taplar
[14:51:38] <taplar> it's anyones guest
[14:51:41] <taplar> hey!
[14:51:44] <overflowPaul> hi!
[14:52:10] <taplar> so what's going on?
[14:52:40] <overflowPaul> im having the same issue as before but with a different clone
[14:52:55] <taplar> reference for robertmaxrees : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50992393/my-add-and-remove-button-disappears
[14:52:58] <overflowPaul> i tried to alter your js but it didnt seem to work
[14:53:12] <taplar> so the buttons are still disappearing?
[14:53:37] <overflowPaul> the first clone form is fine now.
[14:53:51] <overflowPaul> but its not working on my second clone form
[14:54:05] <taplar> how does your second form differe from your first?
[14:54:47] <overflowPaul> sent you a message
[14:55:25] <taplar> the room encourages users to share in public so many people can help.
[14:55:36] <overflowPaul> Perfect!
[14:55:55] <overflowPaul> https://thepasteb.in/p/pghQJW4ZE0YCR
[14:56:24] <taplar> so that looks like your original logic
[14:57:11] <overflowPaul> its a little different from the first one
[14:57:22] <taplar> i mean the methods
[14:57:31] <taplar> none of the class logic is in there
[14:58:17] <overflowPaul> ok so the answer you gave me earlier wouldnt work?
[14:58:36] <taplar> no it should.  you just have to modify those methods to do the class logic like I showed in the question
[14:58:42] <taplar> when you clone, give them a class
[14:58:48] <taplar> and when you delete, only delete things with that class
[15:00:47] <overflowPaul> are you creating a new class?
[15:01:16] <taplar> if you look at the answer I have, i added the line to addClass to the clone
[15:01:21] <taplar> that's putting the class on it
[15:01:46] <taplar> you can give it whatever class you want.  there isn't any restriction, other than being a valid string pattern for a class name
[15:03:21] <overflowPaul> https://thepasteb.in/p/j2hlwXo80OvfP
[15:03:33] <overflowPaul> this is what i have and now my buttons will not work
[15:04:12] <robertmaxrees> erm
[15:04:20] <robertmaxrees> you can't re-use the same function name fwiw
[15:04:36] <taplar> ah, true
[15:05:06] <taplar> yeah, so your first one had a single function.  now you have two ?
[15:05:14] <overflowPaul> yes
[15:05:22] <overflowPaul> thats the difference
[15:05:30] <taplar> you don't really have to do that.  all you need to do is modify what you had
[15:05:58] <overflowPaul> in which way?
[15:06:29] <taplar> after you clone, add the class.  and when you remove use that modified selector to only get the last element of that class
[15:07:07] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/xr6wemku/1/
[15:08:05] <taplar> $('#dvMaterialsClone').clone().removeAttr('id').addClass('materialsRow').show()  says find the element, clone it, remove the id from the clone, add the class to the clone, and show it
[15:08:29] <taplar> $("#dvMaterials .materialsRow").last().remove();  says find all materialRows that are a child of dvMaterials, get the last one, remove it
[15:08:48] <taplar> if there are no materialsRow left, the last and remove will operate on nothing and be effectively ignored
[15:09:01] <overflowPaul> wow you guys are amazing thank you! i will work on this and keep you updated.
[15:09:07] <taplar> np
[15:11:43] <overflowPaul> that worked perfectly
[15:11:49] <taplar> good deal
[15:11:53] <robertmaxrees> kille.
[15:11:56] <robertmaxrees> *kille
[15:12:00] <taplar> you understand what it's doing, and why?
[15:12:02] <robertmaxrees> wtf hahahaha
[15:12:29] <taplar> mmm, you should have followed up your typo with
[15:12:30] <taplar> errr
[15:13:08] <overflowPaul> yes, i have your write up stored for future reference
[15:13:19] <taplar> cool
[15:13:38] <taplar> how long have you been using jQuery?
[15:14:24] <overflowPaul> not long at all, im actually in a new career path, ive been doing backend
[15:14:40] <taplar> ahh, then i want to ask if you are familiar with learn.jquery.com ?
[15:14:50] <overflowPaul> i am not
[15:15:01] <overflowPaul> pretty good learning site im assuming
[15:15:07] <taplar> i would recommend giving it a browse.  it's a pretty good resource for intro stuff
[15:15:09] <robertmaxrees> it IS from the source :)
[15:15:41] <taplar> there is also try.jquery.com that has some live workable problems you can play with
[15:15:52] <taplar> for a more hands on approach
[15:16:25] <robertmaxrees> try is gone
[15:16:31] <taplar> waaa?
[15:16:37] <taplar> :'(
[15:16:42] <robertmaxrees> the company that hosted it killed it.
[15:16:51] <taplar> well that sux
[15:18:17] <taplar> it's not even in github, :(
[15:19:25] <robertmaxrees> yeah, wasn't run by the foundation
[15:19:34] <robertmaxrees> it was from another company.
[15:20:42] <taplar> now to go deny this random person who tried to add me on linkedin
[15:20:49] * taplar eyes overflowPaul
[15:20:59] <taplar> :D
[15:20:59] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaa
[15:23:45] <Miles8of9> robertmaxrees, what event is triggered after an ajax has loaded some data into a webpage?
[15:24:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:24:33] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/
[15:24:46] <Miles8of9> $('#something').on('load' ...... this has been removed!
[15:25:01] <robertmaxrees> that's not what load is for.
[15:25:08] <taplar> load events are really only for window, iframes, and images
[15:25:09] <robertmaxrees> load is for specific elements, like iframes and imgs.
[15:25:14] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:25:15] <Miles8of9> ah
[15:25:26] <robertmaxrees> dom manipulation doesn't have it's own event
[15:25:31] <robertmaxrees> nor should it, tbh.
[15:25:46] <robertmaxrees> you should be explicitly calling any logic you need after you're done./
[15:26:59] <Miles8of9> ready?
[15:27:15] <robertmaxrees> ready is for documents.
[15:27:34] <robertmaxrees> and only when the initial ready has been fired.,
[15:27:48] <robertmaxrees> this feels like an xy problem to me
[15:27:55] <robertmaxrees> what are you doing?
[15:28:38] <Miles8of9> i'm loading a form using $.ajax and i put it in a div inside a page
[15:29:10] <taplar> using the load() method?
[15:29:12] <robertmaxrees> okay.  then put your logic in in your .then() after you do the append.
[15:29:14] <robertmaxrees> bam done
[15:29:48] <Miles8of9> if that form has checkbox that is checked then something should happen
[15:29:55] <Miles8of9> mm ok
[15:30:13] <robertmaxrees> that second half is where a delegated handler comes in handy
[15:30:17] <taplar> are you manipulating the form that is returned from the endpoint in anyway, or are you simply sticking it in the div?
[15:35:44] <Miles8of9> sticking.. but i need to do something
[15:35:58] <taplar> then you might consider http://api.jquery.com/load/
[15:36:08] <taplar> it's a bit of a wrapper around what you are doing, and it accepts a callback
[15:36:09] <Miles8of9> if a checkbox is checked, when the form is loaded...
[15:36:25] <robertmaxrees> Miles8of9 wat
[15:36:38] <robertmaxrees> what determines if the checkbox is checked?
[15:36:54] <robertmaxrees> feels like you're trying to fetch UI as well as sta3te
[15:36:56] <robertmaxrees> *State
[15:37:23] <taplar> i think he's saying he wants to check if the checkbox is checked on the form returned, and if so, do something.
[15:37:31] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:37:40] <Miles8of9> yes.... it's a partial view i get via ajax
[15:37:45] <robertmaxrees> he wants to load a form, and then check that form for a particular state
[15:38:27] <Miles8of9> if there is some validation error, the form is shown again with validation errors
[15:38:49] <taplar> hold on a sec
[15:38:54] <robertmaxrees> ^ :)
[15:38:57] <robertmaxrees> code smell
[15:39:07] <taplar> are you submitting the form, and the ajax is returning the whole form, along with validation errors?
[15:39:16] <Miles8of9> yes
[15:39:20] <taplar> nooooo dude
[15:39:26] <taplar> lol
[15:39:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:39:34] <Miles8of9> submit the form using ajax
[15:39:35] <robertmaxrees> called it
[15:39:55] <taplar> your endpoint should return just the data needed to display the errors
[15:39:56] <robertmaxrees> please tell me you're submitting JSON and not HTML.
[15:41:56] <Miles8of9> it's an http post but chrome says "xhr"
[15:42:07] <robertmaxrees> because you're using ajax.
[15:42:08] <taplar> how are you giving the ajax the data?
[15:42:11] <robertmaxrees> ajax is xhr
[15:42:33] <taplar> $(form).serialize() or something else?
[15:43:27] <Miles8of9> i'm using a library... M$ unobtrusive ajax
[15:43:44] <robertmaxrees> M$?
[15:43:50] <robertmaxrees> you mean microsoft?
[15:44:06] <Miles8of9> yes... i'm doing this in aspnet
[15:44:13] <taplar> so you're doing something like $(formSelector).initializeUnobtrusiveThing() and it just magically does ajax?
[15:45:13] <Miles8of9> no no it's a razor syntax that collects form data and submits to the controller which converts it to a view object using a modelbinder
[15:45:22] <robertmaxrees> so
[15:45:31] <robertmaxrees> in the client, what does your code look like?  your js?
[15:45:32] <taplar> none of that sounds like jQuery.....
[15:45:41] <robertmaxrees> or does this ms setup just automatically handle it?
[15:46:30] <Miles8of9> it's jquery mixed with c# view code for the engine...
[15:46:58] <robertmaxrees> Miles8of9 the client doesn't run c#
[15:47:04] <taplar> ^^^^
[15:47:09] <robertmaxrees> we're trying to understand what your client side code looks like.
[15:47:11] <robertmaxrees> the html/css/js.
[15:48:03] <Miles8of9>         @using (Ajax.BeginForm("SomeAction", "SomeController", null, new AjaxOptions { HttpMethod = "POST", OnSuccess = "javascriptOnSuccess", OnFailure = "javascriptOnFailure" }, new { @class = "form", role = "form", id = "myForm" }))
[15:48:11] <Miles8of9> this is razor syntax
[15:48:17] <robertmaxrees> again
[15:48:29] <robertmaxrees> only html, css, and js are run client-side.
[15:48:42] <robertmaxrees> we don't want anything but the html and js.
[15:48:48] <Miles8of9> this code is rendered as normal html and sent to the browser
[15:48:52] <robertmaxrees> pop it into a fiddle or something', if you don't mind.
[15:49:04] <robertmaxrees> except there's an ajax component here, right?
[15:49:06] <taplar> and please don't be minimized
[15:50:01] <Miles8of9> we sign an nda... i can't give code away -_-
[15:50:08] <robertmaxrees> except...
[15:50:16] <robertmaxrees> you just pasted code into the channel
[15:50:17] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:50:34] <robertmaxrees> Miles8of9 backing up - do you understand why we're asking to see the js?
[15:50:39] <Miles8of9> i renamed action names and controllers -_-
[15:50:57] <taplar> you can still do that in the generated html
[15:50:59] <taplar> and js
[15:51:02] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:51:07] <taplar> but that's what we need to see
[15:51:47] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you gotta tell us how the form is being submitted.
[15:52:29] <Miles8of9> https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/unobtrusive-ajax-and-jquery-for-partial-updates-in-asp-net-mvc/
[15:53:03] <robertmaxrees> D:
[15:53:51] <Miles8of9> i know i should collect data from each field, assemble it into an ajax request, get some json response with field names, manipulate the dom on the client side to add errors etc....
[15:54:14] <taplar> i really feel like this is one of those "helper" libraries that lets the user write forms and it converts them into serialized ajax requests
[15:54:33] <Miles8of9> something like that
[15:55:56] <Miles8of9> in case of validation errors, the partialview returns the form with errors rendered inside the html code
[15:56:12] <Miles8of9> i grab that code and put it inside the placeholder div
[15:56:33] <taplar> the point we're trying to make there though, is that that is very heavy
[15:56:46] <robertmaxrees> for something incredibly basiuc.
[15:57:01] <taplar> it's like you want to paint your house red.  so you tear it down, build a new one, and it's red
[15:57:40] <taplar> buy maybe your restricted by your setup.  idk
[15:57:45] <taplar> *but
[15:57:58] <Miles8of9> i'm a former php programmer, i understand, tell M$... :P
[15:58:19] <taplar> so the endpoint that you are calling with the submit, do you control it?
[15:58:43] <robertmaxrees> you realize that microsoft doesn't really deserve the "M$" joke these days, right?
[15:58:51] <Miles8of9> of course i wrote the controller that handles form submission
[15:59:11] <taplar> and is that endpoint able to return json?
[15:59:32] <Miles8of9> sure
[15:59:51] <taplar> ok.  and you control the function on the front end that gets called for a successful ajax call?
[16:00:59] <Miles8of9> i would need to write tons and tons of c# and jquery code to grab the errors, send them to the client via json and render them into the form
[16:01:09] <robertmaxrees> "tons and ton"?
[16:01:12] <robertmaxrees> *tons
[16:01:18] <taplar> why?  you are already getting the errors that you send to whatever builds the view
[16:02:11] <taplar> if this has any correlation to other languages, from what you said earlier.  you're calling a controller method, doing something, and then using a view builder script to make the html, right?
[16:04:24] <Miles8of9> yes, the controller method returns the form with errors inside the html code
[16:04:36] <taplar> but that's a multipart operation
[16:04:53] <robertmaxrees> the issue is you're returning HTML.
[16:05:13] <taplar> the logic has to build the model to give to the view builder, that contains the data for the view to build from.  that model will contain your errors
[16:05:29] <taplar> your logic is already doing that
[16:06:46] <artie> hey guys - can jquery ui resize images and then keep the images responsive after an img resize then a browser resize occurs?
[16:08:58] <Miles8of9> inside the controller code you write... if (ModelState.IsValid) { code to save data to db etc etc } else { return PartialView(modelClass); }
[16:09:05] <robertmaxrees> artie why not use CSS for that?
[16:09:18] <taplar> so modelClass contains all the information to build the html
[16:09:30] <artie> robertmaxrees: how so?
[16:09:54] <robertmaxrees> artie by using relative sizing
[16:09:59] <robertmaxrees> percentages etrc.

[16:10:56] <artie> after resizing the img then the browser, the img gets cut off
[16:10:59] <Miles8of9> to build the form.. and contains form data... this modelclass is passed to the view rendered that assembles it into the view code and returns everything
[16:11:05] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:11:12] <robertmaxrees> oh that.
[16:11:18] <robertmaxrees> i mean.
[16:11:40] <taplar> so that model also contains the errors that are going to be generated in the view.  so it's not extra logic to get those errors.  you have them already
[16:11:40] <Miles8of9> the model class does not contain errors..... they are assembled by the view rendered
[16:12:14] <Miles8of9> i can get the errors manipulating the ModelState
[16:12:35] <robertmaxrees> artie so you mean move handle -> resize window -> can no longer reach handle?
[16:12:44] <taplar> which you could return to the frontend in a json pattern, potentially
[16:13:10] <taplar> which the frontend could then interrogate and manipulate the existing form to show the errors.

[16:13:43] <artie> yes robertmaxrees, it should be responsive (become smaller)
[16:14:14] <Miles8of9> that is possible... but i would need to write TONS of jquery code
[16:14:22] <taplar> iirc, resizable sets an inline style properties on the element itself
[16:14:35] <artie> yes
[16:14:47] <taplar> at which point those would override any css rules you have
[16:15:06] <robertmaxrees> artie that's not what "responsive" mean fwiw.
[16:15:12] <taplar> Miles8of9: how so.  what are you imagining?
[16:16:31] <taplar> or better yet, how are errors displayed actually?
[16:16:56] <taplar> hovers?  banner up top?  new elements next to the form fields?
[16:16:57] <Miles8of9> i would need to parse that json response, cycle all error messages and put the error text near the form element
[16:17:05] <taplar> sure
[16:17:16] <taplar> that's not a ton of javascript, if you format your json appropriately
[16:17:47] <taplar> your form element had to have a name, otherwise it would not have submitted
[16:17:59] <taplar> errors in the json response can be associated with that name
[16:18:13] <taplar> easy way to find the element you need to apply an error to
[16:18:25] <artie> robertmaxrees / taplar: any idea how to make that work?
[16:18:39] <Miles8of9> i know very little of js and jquery... your idea is correct but looks like fkin hard to me -_-
[16:18:51] <robertmaxrees> then let us help yopu
[16:19:07] <robertmaxrees> artie you'll nbeed to bind a listener to the window resize event and check the bounds.
[16:19:20] <robertmaxrees> though as a major caveat: you shouldn't need to do that.
[16:19:34] <robertmaxrees> i doubt most of your users will resize their browser window.
[16:20:19] <artie> robertmaxrees: you're right, but many have different screen sizes
[16:20:46] <taplar> and?
[16:21:27] <taplar> ^ @artie
[16:21:30] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:22:17] <artie> if I resize the img to take up the full width of my screen (then save it), how would that look on a mobile phone?
[16:22:33] <robertmaxrees> "then save it"???
[16:22:37] <taplar> heh
[16:22:40] <robertmaxrees> i'm so confused about what you're building lol
[16:23:20] <artie> yes, the changes made can be saved
[16:24:09] <artie> that's why I'm wondering how to make the changes that jquery ui resize makes responsive
[16:24:18] <taplar> so... you're wanting to make it so that an image on a desktop can be resized, saved, and then a mobile device can pull up that image and it display fine?
[16:24:33] <artie> yes
[16:24:45] <taplar> jquery ui only affects whatever device it is running on
[16:24:59] <taplar> any save you do that takes that state out of the client, is outside the realm of jquery
[16:25:27] <taplar> so let me pose this question
[16:25:38] <taplar> how are images created?
[16:26:14] <artie> the img is uploaded
[16:26:29] <taplar> ok, so lets say a user uploads an image that is 400x400
[16:26:34] <taplar> doesn't resize it
[16:26:46] <taplar> that's beyond the bounds of an iPhone 5
[16:27:05] <taplar> how would you make that appear "correctly" on the iPhone?
[16:27:15] <artie> css
[16:27:19] <taplar> how?
[16:27:41] <artie> media queries
[16:28:13] <taplar> so you are going to have a css rule that sets the max width to 100vw or max height as 100vh or something?
[16:34:06] <artie> so any idea how to get it working?
[16:34:17] <taplar> i'm still asking you questions, :)
[16:34:49] <robertmaxrees> he's trying to find the right solution :)
[16:35:28] <artie> taplar: using bootstrap works with the absence of resizable also
[16:35:37] <taplar> so you have that working?
[16:36:26] <artie> I don't really have anything for that other than what's in the fiddle
[16:36:41] <taplar> Then as far as I can tell you have two problems
[16:37:09] <taplar> The first one being making an image that exceeds the viewport, or whatever area you want an image to take up, shrink down depending upon device.
[16:37:37] <taplar> The second issue being the resizable issue, which until you get the first one done, I really don't think is an issue.
[16:37:50] <taplar> Because if you are saving the image in it's resized state, you are changing the image
[16:37:57] <taplar> after that point, it falls into the first issue
[16:38:12] <taplar> it either is, or is not, exceeding the space you want it to take up
[16:38:31] <artie> I'm not really saving the image, I'm saving the html
[16:38:34] <artie> and css
[16:38:46] <taplar> wut?
[16:38:52] <artie> the image is there, but it's not being modified
[16:39:18] <taplar> so you're wanting to save the image, and the css that modifies it?
[16:39:27] <robertmaxrees> img tag, i'm guessing.
[16:39:29] <artie> just displayed differently, according to what resizable does
[16:39:55] <taplar> then i really don't know how you are going to do that
[16:40:06] <taplar> inline styles take precedence over rules
[16:41:25] <artie> so without resizable, the img is responsive. after resizable, it's not
[16:41:33] <taplar> because ^^^
[16:41:41] <artie> because of inline styling?
[16:41:44] <taplar> yes
[16:41:45] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[16:41:55] <artie> ok, is there any way around that?
[16:42:02] <robertmaxrees> adding resizable means you don't want it to be responsive.
[16:42:03] <artie> or, any way to make it work?
[16:42:43] <taplar> if there is a way, i feel like this is turning out to be potentially a #css question
[16:43:18] <artie> so do you guys suggest not using jquery ui?
[16:43:26] <taplar> the element is getting the inline style due to jQuery, but the issue is you are trying to get your inline styles to not conflict with your rules, which is a css question
[16:44:12] <taplar> i can't say for sure, myself.  i'm not entirely clear on what your end users are wanting this thing to do
[16:45:18] <artie> they just want to be able to view the img proportionally to the last resize event on all devices
[16:45:26] <robertmaxrees> wait wait
[16:45:32] <robertmaxrees> back way up.
[16:46:10] <robertmaxrees> so the issue here is you're saving explicit dimensions, but then want the frontend to figure out magically what should happen if the user goes from desktop to mobile, right?
[16:46:42] <taplar> i feel like maybe we're also ignoring that mobile devices will scale the content if it gets to large.
[16:47:02] <taplar> which is, effectively, staying in proportion
[16:47:04] <robertmaxrees> ^ there's 2 flaws with the concept
[16:47:13] <artie> essentially, yes. explicit dimensions come from resizable
[16:47:27] <robertmaxrees> 1: how is the frontend supposed to know how to resize things?
[16:47:34] <robertmaxrees> 2: what happens the other way around
[16:47:35] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:47:51] <artie> what happens when scaling up?
[16:47:59] <robertmaxrees> mobile to desktop, yeah?
[16:48:05] <robertmaxrees> *.
[16:48:31] <robertmaxrees> you're basically getting into the game of "figure out what the user might want", which is... funky.
[16:50:20] <artie> it's along the lines of the way bootstrap scales images, except resizable should allow the user the ability to make the image larger or smaller, while changing the responsive scaling appropriately
[16:50:39] <taplar> but those are two different concepts
[16:50:45] <artie> yes
[16:51:38] <taplar> the only way i can think of possibly doing it would be along with saving the css of the resizable, you'd have to save the screen dimensions
[16:52:11] <taplar> and then when displaying on the page, you'd have to adjust the dimensions based on the difference of the current screen dimensions with the one that made the resize
[16:52:38] <artie> yeah, proportionally
[16:52:53] <taplar> which would be a logical operation in javascript.  you wouldn't do that computing in css
[16:54:35] <artie> any idea how it would be done with jquery?
[16:54:59] <taplar> i mean i kinda just said the idea of how it would be done, :)
[16:56:37] <taplar> track the width and height on the image and the width and height of the window making the resize.  then when displaying it on another client, you have to get their window width and height and get a percentage difference for each and apply that against the image width and height
[16:57:12] <taplar> unless there is a css way to scale an element
[17:00:54] <taplar> which it looks like that there is a transform: scale() option possibly
[17:04:34] <artie> hmm.. yeah I see that
[17:05:19] <artie> now it'd just be a matter of getting the right number
[17:05:21] <taplar> so at that point you could potentially scale a parent element of the image, and change it accordingly
[17:05:47] <taplar> which would still require you to keep track of the window size of the person who resized it
[17:06:05] <artie> and calling it in window resize and window load
[17:06:14] <taplar> sure
[17:41:55] <taplar> bow chicka wow wow...
