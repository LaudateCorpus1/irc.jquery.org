[03:08:35] <lemonsparrow> hi all i am using javascript working with array i have a set of data to do add array values object here i attached my code help how to solve this  data  var data=[{one:1,two:2},{one:1,two:2},{one:1,two:2},{one:1,two:2}] expected output  var sumdata=[{one:4,two:8}] NOTE:one two column name is not static
[03:10:00] <Cork> lemonsparrow: so you want to sum the two objects?
[03:10:35] <lemonsparrow> Cork:
[03:10:36] <lemonsparrow> yeah
[03:10:56] <lemonsparrow> Cork: one and two are dynamic
[03:10:56] <Cork> what are your browser compatibility requirements?
[03:11:08] <Cork> ya, i meant sum the objects in the array
[03:11:30] <lemonsparrow> Cork: right
[03:12:16] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I came up with this.. any way to make this short and clear ? https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/095056dd3a2ff9588255a8ea79e2d5f9
[03:12:21] <lemonsparrow> please suggest Cork
[03:13:13] <Cork> what are your browser compatibility requirements? <--
[03:13:44] <Cork> ah, your using reduce already
[03:14:12] <Cork> and ya, that's what i was thinking about too
[03:14:48] <Cork> not fully sure if setting it to r is valid though
[03:15:08] <Cork> you're technically modifying the original data objects
[03:17:52] <lemonsparrow> Cork: right.. can u suggest some improvement without modifying the same !
[03:18:24] <Cork> var result = {}; and using that instead of r
[03:18:56] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I see there could be some ways to make the code concise further functionally ? you think so ?
[03:19:44] <Cork> lemonsparrow: intresting i've missed the initialValue argument in reduce
[03:19:51] <Cork> so no you don't need to do that change
[03:20:18] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[03:20:26] <Cork> i would prob replace Object.create(null) with {}, but that's just me
[03:21:51] <lemonsparrow> Cork: thanks
[03:22:21] <Cork> but ya, there isn't much you can compress that one, you could move to other functions, like $.each, but it does the same thing so not really an improvement
[03:55:23] <teta> can you please look at this? https://pastebin.com/jwVMjKJW    for some reason that call is not working
[03:56:21] <Cork> teta: what call and define "not working"
[03:56:44] <teta> Cork: the line     field.click(testNow());
[03:57:14] <Cork> field.click(testNow()) is the same thing as var v = testNow(); field.click(v)
[03:57:26] <Cork> you want field.click(testNow)
[04:23:30] <teta> Cork: ok so after fixing the declaration
[04:23:51] <teta> the problem is the method actually gets called before I click the text
[04:24:16] <teta> and when I click the text (link) nothing happens
[04:24:31] <Cork> have you removed the () in the declaration?
[04:24:53] <Cork> cause what you state sounds like you are still doing the old solution
[04:25:51] <teta> this is now
[04:25:52] <teta>             testNow: function (event) {                 alert('xxx');             },
[04:26:01] <Cork> use jsfiddle.net
[04:26:17] <teta> field.click(this.testNow());field.click(this.testNow());
[04:26:22] <Cork> ...
[04:26:32] <Cork> so you're still doing what you originally did
[04:26:42] <Cork> read my comment on what it means and what you want
[04:27:34] <Cork> field.click(testNow()) means you're trying to bind return value from testNow as a function in .click()
[04:58:47] <teta> Cork: so changing that should also prevent it from being executed when I load the page?
[05:19:22] <Cork> teta: var variable = testNow; means assign the reference to testNow to variable
[05:19:34] <Cork> later calling variable() would execute testNow
[05:19:46] <Cork> it is how callbacks work
[05:21:04] <teta> Cork: so if I only leave this                 field.click(testNow)            then it will only be executed when I click the thing right?
[05:21:14] <Cork> yes
[05:21:35] <Cork> teta: note though this.testNow will lose the connection to this
[05:23:02] <teta> so         field.click(testNow)        only when clicked,              field.click(testNow())         also when the page is loaded
[05:23:17] <Cork> no
[05:23:35] <Cork> field.click(testNow()) can be writted as testNow() it won't do anything on click
[05:23:58] <Cork> cause the return value from testNow will be given to .click() not a function it can call
[05:47:41] <d3m0n> I made a "search-as-you-type" script that uses AJAX and I added an abort() to the AJAX if a new request comes in as suggested here on second answer https://goo.gl/yzmTq4. The problem I am having is while it looks to be aborting the AJAX call, the last call that does go through lags as if it's still making all the previous calls when typing in the search.
[06:00:56] <FilipNortic_> d3m0n: maby abort() doesn't do what you think. It can't magicly tell backend to stop proccessing the request. It just treats it as aready done and stop waiting for the callback
[06:02:43] <FilipNortic_> so if you have a happy-trigger ajax-request it may still overload your backend even though you aborted the callback
[06:04:11] <d3m0n> FilipNortic_: ahhh that would explain it then, I was under the assumption abort() stopped everything
[06:05:21] <FilipNortic_> d3m0n: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/abort
[06:10:17] <blinky_> Morning all, Trying to get a timeout working within a timeout but failing badly, could someone have a quick look and point me in the right direction? - https://jsfiddle.net/8djbwecm/
[06:16:27] <FilipNortic_> blinky_: feel like that is working both timeouts goes through callbacks if you want multible you have to have some kind of loop
[06:17:40] <FilipNortic_> or a function with a timeout that calls itslef on each completetion
[06:21:59] <teta> Cork: I'm getting this         Uncaught ReferenceError: testNow is not defined
[06:24:59] <FilipNortic_> teta: If you can make a fiddle of your code more other people might be willing to take a look
[06:25:40] <teta> FilipNortic_: https://jsfiddle.net/zhm1dff7/
[06:25:48] <teta> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/zhm1dff7/
[06:26:52] <Cork> teta: ya, cause like i said before this.testNow is not the same thing as testNow
[06:27:53] <teta> Cork: where do I need to put the function to make it work without the this.
[06:28:09] <Cork> teta: it needs to be a locally defined function
[06:28:22] <Cork> so var testNow = function() {} or function testNow() {}
[06:28:43] <teta> so the way it is now I need to call this.testNow            correct?
[06:29:06] <Cork> yes
[06:31:37] <teta> so the real file actually looks something like this     https://jsfiddle.net/zhm1dff7/1/
[06:32:09] <teta> so the first line is          (function() {           actually
[06:32:20] <Cork> ya, this references to gegDetailsPanel
[06:32:32] <Cork> so to access gegDetailsPanel.testNow you need this.testNow
[06:32:50] <teta> so what is gegDetailsPanel, just an object?
[06:32:56] <Cork> ja
[06:33:12] <teta> which is inside another object called       egr.panelManager
[06:33:20] <teta> which is inside a function?
[06:33:26] <Cork> well to be specific it is a property of panelManager and the content is an object
[06:34:02] <teta> so what's the point in putting   function(){     in the first line?
[06:34:14] <Cork> what you have is most likely (function() { })();
[06:34:38] <teta> well yeah the first line is         (function() {
[06:34:43] <teta> and the last line closes that function
[06:34:46] <Cork> this is a name scope it just there so variables you define inside it doesn't pollute the global scope
[06:34:49] <teta> what's the point of having that?
[06:35:08] <teta> ah ok
[06:35:18] <Cork> (function() { var me = true; })() me == undefined
[06:38:16] <teta> So really the function I am trying to call is the one in the last line here https://jsfiddle.net/y3wz6so7/
[06:38:23] <teta> which is in another .js file
[06:38:38] <teta> is there a way I can do that from the place in the first jsfiddle?
[06:44:12] <Cork> teta: not unless they assign that function to a property that is globally accessable
[06:44:31] <Cork> that function is local to createQuickSearchForm, so it doesn't exist outside it
[06:48:37] <teta> Cork: can I call createQuickSearchForm() directly?
[06:49:54] <teta> it is still inside a    (         function () {         block
[06:51:55] <blinky_> ok guys getting closer but bugger something up - https://jsfiddle.net/8djbwecm/1/
[07:10:06] <Cork> wow that fiddle has problem on so many levels...
[08:04:01] <FilipNortic_> can't you nest timeouts i though you could?
[08:08:09] <Cork> sure you can
[08:08:24] <Cork> but he calls a name he uses as a function name AND a variable name
[08:09:12] <Cork> additionally he creates an additional variable with the same name that he sets to 0 for every time the timer would be called
[08:13:25] <FilipNortic_> oh right, that's not at all what I suggested
[08:15:21] <Uhkis> not to mention the function itself sets it to 0
[08:23:23] <Cork> Uhkis: that was the "additionally" ya :)
[08:23:55] <Cork> but ya, i didn't even think about it happening in the outer timer too
[08:26:00] <Uhkis> i wonder what's the actual goal in that
[08:27:30] <Cork> i think this is what he was trying to do https://jsfiddle.net/8djbwecm/3/
[08:30:40] <Uhkis> not enough seconds! :D
[08:31:03] <willbeeler> hi everyone.. I was using this script in a project, and it works great.. http://jsfiddle.net/Fx6dD/
[08:31:17] <willbeeler> however, how do I add some wait time in between the ajax events?
[08:31:25] <willbeeler> let's say 10 seconds
[08:31:27] <willbeeler> or whatever
[08:31:58] <willbeeler> i've seen .delay.. but I may be using a version that's earlier
[08:32:19] <willbeeler> there's also .setTimeout.. but how would I implement that in that code?
[08:32:39] <willbeeler> jquery isn't my forte, but I'm dangerous enough to get into things
[08:32:50] <Cork> Uhkis: fine https://jsfiddle.net/8djbwecm/4/
[08:33:19] <Uhkis> Cork: lol
[08:33:30] <Cork> willbeeler: that doesn't create a queue it calls them all at once
[08:33:36] <Uhkis> Cork: now the question is: what's that mysterious html
[08:33:44] <Cork> you would have to make the call in the success callback to do what you want
[08:34:20] <Cork> Uhkis: i suspect it is a toggler to rotate a graph
[08:34:34] <willbeeler> Cork: ok.. is there an example of the concept that you're talking about, like a link that I can read?
[08:34:36] <Cork> so a form of self made slideshow
[08:35:15] <Uhkis> Cork: i meant that var!
[08:35:25] <Cork> ah
[08:35:26] <Cork> ya
[08:35:27] <Uhkis> it's just there, chilling
[08:35:41] <FilipNortic_> willbeeler: this is something unrelated it think
[08:35:48] <FilipNortic_> I think*
[08:36:04] <willbeeler> FilipNortic_ not sure i understand
[08:36:38] <Cork> willbeeler: is the point that you want to fetch an update every x seconds?
[08:36:45] <Cork> (of the code you have right now)
[08:36:57] <willbeeler> Yeah.. i believe so
[08:37:06] <Cork> k one min
[08:37:17] <willbeeler> Basically, i want it to run, then cool, success.. now wait a time, then continue
[08:39:38] <Cork> willbeeler: http://jsfiddle.net/Fx6dD/135/
[08:40:00] <willbeeler> haha.. awesome man.. you rock
[08:40:26] <willbeeler> btw, is that milliseconds?
[08:40:29] <Cork> yes
[08:40:30] <willbeeler> i cant remember
[08:40:32] <willbeeler> ok thx
[08:40:36] <Uhkis> it's not a coincidence that Cork ~= rock
[08:40:39] <willbeeler> DUDE, u really rock, thx
[08:40:42] <Cork> willbeeler: do you want a delay for the first request too?
[08:40:52] <willbeeler> nah.. it's good the way it is
[08:41:33] <FilipNortic_> Cork: shouldn't next be called in an always()?
[08:41:59] <FilipNortic_> no the cycle breaks on one fail right?
[08:42:02] <FilipNortic_> now*
[08:42:23] <Cork> FilipNortic_: true, it should setTimeout should be in always
[08:42:36] <Cork> uh setTimeout should be in always
[08:42:56] <Cork> willbeeler: http://jsfiddle.net/Fx6dD/136/
[08:43:07] <Cork> implementing FilipNortic_'s suggestion
[08:43:29] <willbeeler> oh ok.. i like it, you guys are amazing
[08:46:51] <willbeeler> ttyl
[11:12:44] <Srgjames> So I made a jsfiddle https://jsfiddle.net/g53q8uwj/ And everything seems to work insept the part where it tells me the Id of the check box selected it always says the id is 41 which is the first checkbox id. How can I get it to give me the value of the correct id selected.
[11:13:41] <taplar> you are not selecting the checkbox that is checked.
[11:13:46] <taplar> you are selecting them all
[11:14:51] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/g53q8uwj/2/
[13:00:19] <Srgjames> taplar ty i tried that way earlier i thought but i guess not
[14:58:30] <tsukasadt> I wrote a little snippet to turn entire TR elements into links (yeah, said and done, I know). I then added logic to the eventListener to "simulate" Shift+Click, Ctrl+Click, Cmd+Click, and Middle Click as much as JavaScript can (using window.open(x ,'_blank") instead of window.location). I even disabled action if right-clicking to allow the menu to
[14:58:31] <tsukasadt> load and the page not be changed. Everything was great, until I needed to add secondary anchors to the TR. While this work, clicking them also triggers the eventListener. Is it possible to have it detect if the eventListener is triggered while clicking one of these specific child anchors? https://thepasteb.in/p/0ghDcWMBlY5kycz
[15:04:51] <taplar> so if it is one of your child anchors you don't want it to do your custom logic, i take it?
[15:05:19] <Es0teric> i have this code: <sub class="count" data-bp-reaction-count='2'></sub> but when i do this: console.log( $('.count').data('bp-reaction-count') ); it doesnt output it on the console.log
[15:05:52] <taplar> try using camel case instead
[15:06:12] <Es0teric> taplar what do you mean?
[15:06:21] <taplar> data('bpReactionCount')
[15:12:53] <Es0teric> taplar still not working
[15:13:16] <taplar> console.log( $('.count').length );
[15:32:22] <tsukasadt> Sorry, taplar, I was distracted with another issue. Yes, that's basically the situation. The entire TR is to act as an anchor to the main target while not affecting these focused anchors. They're in their own cell, but I don't want to put the eventListener on each TD except that one if I could avoid it.
[15:33:22] <taplar> you could put a listener on each of those anchors and stopPropagation() on them, so they wouldn't bubble up to the outer listener
[15:33:57] <tsukasadt> Wouldn't that stop those anchors from functioning, too?
[15:35:41] <taplar> no, stopPropagation only stops bubbling
[15:35:52] <taplar> where as preventDefault() would stop their normal execution
[15:36:53] <tsukasadt> Alright, I'll give it a shot.
[15:42:55] <tsukasadt> If I applied the stopPropagation to a wrapper element, would it work for the links, or would do I need to apply it individually?
[15:44:47] <taplar> what ever element you apply it to, the events will not bubble up out of it
[15:47:54] <tsukasadt> So, yes. It worked applying to a wrapper element. tyvm, taplar. :)
[15:48:11] <taplar> np, glad you got a solution
[15:48:42] <tsukasadt> One of these days I'll actually learn the language the last 3 years of my life have been dedicated to writing. xD
[20:45:51] <zg> Can someone take a look at this fairly trivial example usage of jQuery.on and tell me why I can't click "service 1", "service 2", etc. to get an alert? https://jsfiddle.net/7afd349L/2/
[20:51:32] <zg> AHA!
[20:51:48] <zg> I needed $(document).on(event, selector, handler)
