[00:03:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> Lann: ask it anyways....the jquery police wont care
[00:05:03] <Lann> I'm a bit confused about how the code should be organized. I understand that it's expecting models and such but that isn't really practical yet coming from non OO code. Where would I put the code that previously executed on document.ready? I mean basicaly my existing code is composed of JS functions, event handlers, and code that should run on document.ready
[00:05:30] <Lann> (converting a codebase to backbone.js)
[00:07:52] <sacho> there's a channel for backbone
[00:08:00] <Lann> which?
[00:08:26] <sacho> #documentcloud
[00:08:34] <Lann> already there, everyon idle heh
[00:09:10] <sacho> well, backbone must have some initializer methodology.
[00:09:43] <Lann> i'm running the require.js boilerplate structure
[00:10:20] <Lann> so i already have it where it can execute a view ….but i'm still a bit fuzzy on what a view would be for me
[00:10:39] <ravenzz> maybe you don't need it at all?
[00:10:44] <ravenzz> are you rendering server side?
[00:10:54] <Lann> yes, it's a standard lamp app
[00:10:58] <Lann> multi-page
[00:11:15] <Lann> they want to load dependencies only when needed, and organize our like 20k line .js file haha
[00:11:23] <ravenzz> any specific reason why you decided to go for backbone?
[00:11:39] <Lann> we thought it could be used for code organization
[00:12:06] <ravenzz> how far are you in the migration to backbone process?
[00:12:26] <Lann> only slightly but it's also the only framework for JS that anyone on the team knows
[00:12:42] <Lann> and even at that none of us really knows it
[00:13:02] <Lann> but we all want to learn it heh
[00:13:40] <Lann> my understanding is that backbone.js is often used for single page apps
[00:13:52] <Lann> but it also has an MVC structure that we might be able to take advantage of for code organization
[00:14:16] <Lann> and require.js i'm a bit fuzzy on but it seems to be like…js dependency injection at compile time
[00:14:59] <ravenzz> I would like to suggest you to try Flight the js framework from twitter http://twitter.github.io/flight/ I recorded a screencast on how to get started with it (please don't mind my crappy english) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DftC518igCY also watch this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WRmFp8jZjc
[00:15:25] <ravenzz> probably you don't need an MVC framework
[00:15:32] <Lann> thanks but probably not because we want to go with the most popular one
[00:15:39] <Lann> we probably dont i know
[00:15:45] <Lann> i suppose i could just split the JS into files
[00:15:54] <Lann> but we sorta want to try something that could be more organized
[00:16:07] <ravenzz> flight is perfect for your purpose
[00:16:18] <Lann> (for us this is also a resume thing)
[00:16:30] <Lann> bootstrap.js and require.js being a commonly desired thing
[00:16:31] <ravenzz> you organize your app in indipendent components
[00:16:48] <Lann> sorry
[00:16:50] <Lann> i meant bakbone.js
[00:16:51] <ravenzz> np
[00:17:15] <ravenzz> yeah I hear you but man I decided to don't care about the resume
[00:17:27] <Lann> we're freelancers heh
[00:17:32] <Lann> matters alot
[00:18:04] <ravenzz> I don't need backbone, and I don't like front-end MVC framerowks .. if you don't want to hire me because of that maybe we are not good for each other
[00:18:12] <Lann> typical job is something like skype: "hey you know bootstrap.js" yes/no = job or not
[00:18:21] <Lann> *backbone hahaha
[00:18:23] <Lann> i keep doing that
[00:18:59] <ravenzz> yea
[00:19:09] <Lann> it's quite tough to grind out about $5k/mo on a purely telecommute basis
[00:19:12] <Lann> for me anyways
[00:19:49] <Lann> sometimes it's not so bad with ongoing contracts but when finding new ones is extremely competitive
[00:20:07] <ravenzz> ok fair enough, I thought you had a company
[00:20:47] <Lann> no if that was the case i'd lean more towards a simple fix like splitting up into more organized files
[00:21:02] <Lann> but honestly this app is complex enough it could possibly benefit from mvc
[00:21:05] <Lann> the JS is spaghetti
[00:22:16] <Lann> anyhow i still am not sure where such a thing as initializing an array that should be initialized on document.ready would live
[00:24:29] <Lann> even more complex and/or anoyingly i dont see a reason to have a controller
[00:24:40] <Lann> my bundle's main.js can do anything a controller would have done
[00:33:20] <Lann> heh helpful: http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/12/23/backbone-js-is-not-an-mvc-framework/
[00:40:46] <Lann> ravenzz: so according to that article and what i'm reading…the view would represent most of a page and i'd only use models when i need an object in the OO sense for oganization purposes
[00:40:49] <ButtDog> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16540723/django-ajax-file-upload on awnser #2 what's the best way to call that function?
[00:41:05] <Lann> and controllers more or less are a lie
[00:42:03] <ravenzz> well when you render server side you don't need views and controllers I guess
[00:44:00] <ravenzz> http://www.moshebergman.com/2013/02/backbone-like-speed-with-server-side-rendering/
[00:45:14] <kuter> hello all
[00:45:19] <kuter> i have problem with variables
[00:45:34] <kuter> i'd like to declare global variable and then change it whitin function
[00:45:39] <kuter> but i can't
[00:45:45] <ravenzz> why would you do that?
[00:47:14] <kuter> i need
[00:48:34] <kuter> http://pastebin.com/ERZgAwnL
[00:49:43] <ravenzz> ajax requests are asynchronous
[00:49:46] <kuter> i can't assign data.day_nums to varible num_days
[00:50:10] <ravenzz> if you alert inside the success callback in the ajax req
[00:50:21] <ravenzz> it will work
[00:50:27] <kuter> but alert works proper
[00:50:43] <kuter> within function
[00:50:52] <dan2k3k4> I have a small problem with href="#selectorID" being used to 'scroll to' <div id="selectorID"></div> - however the id is inside a list of items, which is in a wrapper, that's inside a jQuery Tab, which is a pop-up on a map o_0
[00:51:07] <dan2k3k4> and it causes the page and the map along with the pop-up to scroll to the top
[00:51:10] <ravenzz> kuter you wrote a comment at line 9 alert(num_days); // its 0
[00:51:29] <dan2k3k4> instead of scrolling the list part to the top (the list has overflow: auto and fixed height)
[00:52:03] <kuter> ravenzz: because i expect data.days_num instead 0
[00:52:04] <dan2k3k4> so basically I'm looking for a solution to scroll a list (think of it as an Address book with ABCDEF on the side)
[00:52:23] <ravenzz> kuter and I told you why it is not data.days_num
[00:52:31] <ravenzz> [09:49] <ravenzz> ajax requests are asynchronous
[00:52:38] <kuter> i see
[00:53:06] <ravenzz> try to alert inside the $.get callback
[00:53:34] <kuter> ok i'll try
[00:53:34] <kuter> w8
[01:00:42] <kuter> ravenzz: i mean .done method ?

[02:10:28] <spygame> hey guys, i have a requirement where i'm supposed to use datetimepicker and for each date select i'm supposed to see predefined time slots, i'm using jquery datetimepicker for that. i'm stuck at how to show the time slots using a preloaded json file. is there a way to store that json response in the current session.  the feature is somewhat similar to google helpouts calendar
[03:20:08] <ButtDog> Any idea why I can't get all the form value and the file and ajax post them? https://dpaste.de/WM15
[03:22:23] <Cork> ButtDog: you can't concat the formdata with a string
[03:22:54] <shwaiil> Hi
[03:23:45] <Cork> ButtDog: i would recommend using serializeArray, and then append the fields to the formdata element
[03:23:49] <ButtDog> Cork, what data type is formdata? Also, when just use values it doesn't work properly
[03:23:53] <shwaiil> Q: How to check if an iframe is in readyState ? After reading some examples, I'm testing: $.each($('#foo iframe'), function(k, v){ console.log($(v)[0].readyState); }); but even though the iframe is fully loaded, returns me false. So, not sure if I should rely on this or believe this is written correctly. Any advice ? Thank you!
[03:23:56] <ButtDog> NICE
[03:24:01] <Cork> ButtDog: its FormData
[03:24:14] <Cork> ?mdn formdata
[03:24:15] <b-ot> Cork: FormData - Web API interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[03:25:20] <ButtDog> Cork: Change values to serializeArray, then formdata.append(values)
[03:25:22] <ButtDog> ?
[03:25:28] <Cork> no
[03:26:12] <Cork> $.each(form.serializeArray(), function(elm) { formdata.append(elm.name, elm.value); });
[03:26:17] <shwaiil> * I know about .load() but at the moment, for some browsers I'd like to check at any point if the iframe is in ready state. Thanks!
[03:26:48] <Cork> shwaiil: you can only check for ready if the iframe is from the same domain
[03:27:17] <Cork> and then you have to listen for domready in the iframe and push it to the parent pate
[03:27:20] <Cork> *page
[03:28:02] <shwaiil> Cork: thanks for looking! I see. That's interesting because I've got this "Tweets" that are inserted in a SinglePageApp and I need to know when they are ready so I can make sure I trigger some actions.
[03:28:16] <shwaiil> In that case, I guess the only way to tell is, checking if the iframe height changes
[03:28:35] <shwaiil> on a interval
[03:28:39] <Cork> shwaiil: then you need to listen for the load event
[03:29:01] <shwaiil> Cork: I'm relying on "load", but it fails on Safari
[03:29:22] <Cork> shwaiil: there is a huge list of limitations to height, scrollbars and A LOT of other values from iframes
[03:29:24] <shwaiil> $("iframe").load(doSomething()) it's not reliable on safari
[03:29:32] <Cork> cause it can be used to leak data from other elements
[03:29:39] <Cork> .load(doSomething) not .load(doSomething())
[03:29:58] <shwaiil> Cork: yeah, sorry was just trying to be clear
[03:30:31] <shwaiil> So. the only solution is sticking with .load() ?
[03:30:49] <shwaiil> Not sure what to do with Safari
[03:31:01] <Cork> it is the only one you can count on yes
[03:31:57] <ButtDog> Cork: It's not parsing the Array properly I believe: https://dpaste.de/1UQp
[03:33:49] <Cork> ButtDog: opps
[03:33:55] <Cork> sorry the first argument is the index >_<
[03:34:17] <Cork> ButtDog: function() { formdata.append(this.name, this.value); });
[03:34:28] <shwaiil> Cork: Thanks for your advice.
[03:35:31] <viktorminator> hi all. can anyone enlight me how to make next feature. I want to make FAQ page which consists of div id="faq1" ... So every time someone visit mysite.com/faq#faq1 he see this div highlighted or everything except this block is shadowed.
[03:35:34] <viktorminator> How to make this highlight-by-link feature (I don't know what event or how to this can be applied) and what is the name of such plugin for highlighting (I've seen that type of plugins, but don't know how they are named)? Pls link me somewhere :) or at least give words to google for. I have just idea but don't know proper words for googleing. Thanks
[03:36:12] <shwaiil> Cork: the reason why I can't use readyState is because of Same Origin Policy ?
[03:36:16] <ButtDog> Cork: the fields are being passed properly via the post, but the file isn't. Btw, thanks for all your help. I've been trying to do an ajax post with Django for 7 days now :/
[03:37:46] <Cork> shwaiil: cause readyState is on the document, and in cross domain you can't access the document from the page
[03:37:57] <Cork> shwaiil: readyState on the iframe isn't cross browser
[03:38:12] <ButtDog> Here's the current code: https://dpaste.de/x7Cs Not sure why it's unable to post the file
[03:40:29] <Cork> hmm
[03:40:49] <ButtDog> Cork: Sorry my mistake, JS is fine, it's error in my backend logic. Thanks for all your help !
[03:41:02] <ButtDog> Cork: Wow, I've finnally got it. I can't thank you enough.
[03:41:30] <shwaiil> Cork: thanks for your knowledge I've got a infinite interval running then in my app :(
[03:41:34] <Cork> ButtDog: np
[03:41:46] <Cork> shwaiil: yuck...
[03:42:08] <Cork> ButtDog: btw have you tried something as simple as var formdata = new FormData($("#form_upload")[0]); ?
[03:42:37] <Cork> if the file field is in the form that is
[03:43:21] <shwaiil> Cork: yeah it's true and is still running console.log(i++); For Safari though and because this specific issue is related with iframe height change, I'll have to rely on the initial state of the iframe height being 0 and when the iframe height changes, trigger my actions. The Tweets widget usually have a common height size, so for safari I think this is what I'll now test. I've got .load() for all browsers but i
[03:43:21] <shwaiil> s not reliable on Safari.
[03:43:23] <ButtDog> Cork, to be honest I don't know any JQuery. Just Javascript. But I'm going to try to refactor using that now.
[03:43:48] <Cork> ButtDog: $("#form_upload")[0] just grabs the form element
[03:44:12] <Cork> ButtDog: and i think FormData() accepts that as an argument and would grab all the fields from it by default
[03:44:43] <ButtDog> Cork, That sounds quite nice actually
[03:45:11] <Cork> ButtDog: it should be a quite easy thing to test
[03:46:12] <fuchstronaut> what is the best way to add a jqObject to another one? a = a.add(b) ?
[03:46:22] <Cork> fuchstronaut: yes
[03:47:12] <fuchstronaut> repeating this in a loop, do i have to be concerned about performance issues?
[03:48:53] <Cork> fuchstronaut: what are you doing
[03:48:58] <Cork> creating elements?
[03:49:00] <fuchstronaut> no
[03:49:27] <Cork> cause it sounds like you should be using .filter or similar instead
[03:49:32] <fuchstronaut> I have an array containing jq elements, im looping it, "pushing" them into a new one and then hide em
[03:49:57] <Cork> way you have an array of arrays with elements?
[03:50:04] <Cork> *wait
[03:50:07] <fuchstronaut> no
[03:50:12] <fuchstronaut> haha Ill pastebin
[03:50:18] <Cork> then what do you mean by jq elements?
[03:50:45] <Cork> jquery wrapped elements is elements wrapped in an array like object
[03:53:58] <shwaiil> Q: Is this valid if there's a listener as $('iframe#foo').ready() ? $('iframe#foo').trigger('ready'); ? Thanks!
[03:54:05] <fuchstronaut> Cork: http://pastebin.com/5Z6nH1tP <- basicly im filtering
[03:54:37] <Cork> shwaiil: don't put element names infront of id's
[03:54:42] <fuchstronaut> now i see im an idiot
[03:55:00] <Cork> shwaiil: it is a waist to first search the dom for elements with the name iframe
[03:55:03] <fuchstronaut> i can just have non-jq-objects in my rowList array and wrap it ot become an jq element
[03:55:06] <shwaiil> Cork: Ok!
[03:55:15] <Cork> and then check the quick hash table if the iframe's id is in there
[03:55:49] <Cork> fuchstronaut: don't use arrays that way
[03:55:52] <Cork> it will be buggy
[03:55:55] <Cork> you want an object
[03:56:03] <Cork> rowList = {};
[03:56:09] <fuchstronaut> ok
[03:56:23] <Cork> fuchstronaut: arrays should always be sequential
[03:56:33] <fuchstronaut> makes sense
[03:56:35] <Cork> if you have random indexes use objects
[03:56:55] <Cork> fuchstronaut: also just store this in the array
[03:57:03] <Cork> no need to wrap it in jquery
[03:57:17] <fuchstronaut> can i throw arrays at not() method?
[03:57:29] <fuchstronaut> *arrays containing DOM elements
[03:58:20] <fuchstronaut> looks like i can, works like a charm
[03:58:29] <fuchstronaut> thanks Cork!
[03:58:44] <Cork> fuchstronaut: $($.map(rowList, function(i, row) { return row; }))
[03:59:21] <Cork> fuchstronaut: but what i would do instead is
[04:00:33] <Cork> var excludeMe = [1,2,3,4]; $('div.listview > table > tbody > tr').filter(function() { return $.inArray($(this).data('index'), excludeMe) !== -1; }).hide()
[04:00:58] <Cork> uh...
[04:01:04] <Cork> var excludeMe = [1,2,3,4]; $('div.listview > table > tbody > tr').filter(function() { return $.inArray($(this).data('index'), excludeMe) === -1; }).hide()
[04:01:05] <Cork> :D
[04:01:13] <Cork> anyway i'm off
[04:01:54] <fuchstronaut> thanks man!
[04:19:50] <wodim> is it possible to .submit() a form using ajax? or do i have to write the .ajax() call with serialize and all of that by hand?
[04:21:56] <fuchstronaut> is it smart to use nested functions in javascript?
[04:22:42] <aaairc> can i add schema.org properties after using jquery, that search engines could detect?
[04:23:08] <aaairc> or do the schema.org properties / html have to all be added on initial page load... not with jquery?
[04:41:00] <seutje> aaairc: not all search engine crawlers parse JS
[04:41:19] <seutje> Google's bot does, but it seems risky to rely on it
[04:41:24] <seutje> fine, just leave!
[04:45:01] <tobago> how to access the associated DOM element having set a function to its data within its function?
[04:45:38] <sacho> tobago, try explaining again, that's not very clear
[04:45:59] <tobago> sacho, say I defined a function to the DOM elements data object.
[04:46:09] <sacho> ah, ok.
[04:46:21] <tobago> like $("input").data("foo", function(){})
[04:46:30] <sacho> you cannot, unless when you were defining the function, there was a reference to the dom element in the scope you were defining it.
[04:46:41] <tobago> how to access the DOM element inside the function? this is just the window.
[04:47:20] <tobago> sache can you explain the unless part of your answer a bit more?
[04:47:55] <okdamn> hey guys
[04:48:04] <sacho> var elem = $('input'). elem.data('foo', function () { // use elem })
[04:48:15] <okdamn> How to block body scroll and enable scroll only on element i'm on over?
[04:48:35] <okdamn> i want to avoid body overflow:hidden;
[04:48:48] <tobago> sacho, elem was declared globally?
[04:48:53] <okdamn> or the page will jump cause scrollbars are hidden and showed each time
[04:49:03] <okdamn> any clue? :(
[04:49:52] <sacho> tobago, not necessarily.
[04:50:07] <tobago> sacho, but outside the function.
[04:50:16] <sacho> yes. In the same scope that the function is defined in.
[04:50:27] <sacho> Or a parent scope.
[04:50:51] <tobago> sacho, in the scope of Document ready, it would be quite globally.
[04:51:07] <sacho> that's incorrect.
[04:51:21] <sacho> you're quickly approaching x-y territory here.
[04:51:27] <okdamn> hey :)
[04:51:32] <sacho> why do you need to solve this problem at all?
[04:52:11] <okdamn> how do i make body to not scroll without using css ?
[04:52:12] <okdamn> overflow:hidden
[04:52:52] <okdamn> no one knows? :(
[04:53:32] <tobago> sacho, I want some input elements to push their data to a hidden field. and because they share logic therefore I want it to put into a function, bound to the inputs.
[04:53:42] <seutje> okdamn: does that exclude inline CSS?
[04:53:57] <sacho> tobago, I don't see why you need to bind the function to the elements
[04:53:58] <seutje> cause it's gonna be hard to apply styles without using styles
[04:54:10] <okdamn> seutje: no just don't wanna use position:fixed or overflow:hidden
[04:54:11] <okdamn> :P
[04:54:27] <okdamn> or page will jump in window
[04:54:40] <sacho> tobago, but no matter what you do, you basically need a reference to the element within the scope of the function. You can have it in any scope that the function inherits.
[04:55:01] <seutje> okdamn: well, u'll need to, cause even if you lock the dimensions, the overflow is just gonna stick out and cause a scrollback
[04:55:03] <seutje> scrollbar
[04:55:31] <okdamn> seutje:  doesn't matter if scrollbar is visible ;)
[04:55:42] <okdamn> somenthing like on scroll -> scrolltop recursively
[04:55:44] <okdamn> is this possible?
[04:55:55] <okdamn> leaving element i'm on over to scroll free
[04:56:26] <grafi> ._.
[04:57:09] <seutje> okdamn: sure, but that's pretty nasty
[04:57:14] <okdamn> or disabling mousewheel
[04:57:31] <okdamn> …. :P
[04:57:42] <okdamn> disabling mousewheel only for body not element i'm on over
[04:57:44] <okdamn> :P
[04:57:51] <okdamn> possible? :P
[04:58:10] <Croves> Hi guys, has anyone used this plugin? http://amsul.ca/pickadate.js

[05:11:34] <__rgn> i bet you did not
[05:11:44] <wodim> out the closet
[05:12:36] <alex___> I did, And only found answered about parents
[05:13:23] <__rgn> why do i find a relevant search result with "jquery closest"
[05:15:44] <alex___> I can only find the fact that that's deprecated, no if there is anything to replace it
[05:16:52] <__rgn> not deprecated in the documentation i'm reading
[05:17:13] <alex___> I got 'This signature (only!) is deprecated as of jQuery 1.7 and removed in jQuery 1.8. It was primarily meant to be used internally or by plugin authors.'
[05:18:19] <__rgn> yes, that's the other and deprecated way to use .closest()
[05:18:27] <__rgn> no idea why you missed the first one on the page
[05:19:34] <alex___> __rgn: ops :( Didn't get it like that, I though the whole thing was deprecated
[05:19:37] <alex___> my bad
[05:20:20] <fuchstronaut> can you recommend a lightweight tooltip plugin for jqurey`?
[05:20:29] <__rgn> np
[05:36:20] <dwarder> can i use $.when without then?
[05:36:43] <dwarder> if i do this inside a for loop
[05:37:19] <dwarder> i.e. don't start next iteration untill $.when is done
[05:38:03] <Cork> dwarder: you can't make a for loop wait
[05:45:08] <dwarder> Cork: how can i work around this?
[05:45:22] <Cork> sure
[05:48:21] <seutje> dwarder: make a loop that calls itself once done
[05:49:01] <dwarder> seutje: can you jsfiddle it?
[05:49:07] <seutje> like var loop = function(){ doStuff(); if (thingsLeftToDo) { loop() } }
[05:49:30] <seutje> might wanna timeout it so it doesn't lock everything though
[05:51:56] <dwarder> seutje: i see, thank you
[05:52:14] <dwarder> locking is ok
[05:56:29] <seutje> dwarder: prolly not very optimized or anything, but should give u an idea http://jsfiddle.net/dX4Be/
[05:57:07] <seutje> the process function is a dummy to fake a blocking operation
[05:57:54] <seutje> like if u up the time difference it'll properly lock the browser: http://jsfiddle.net/dX4Be/1/
[05:59:00] <dwarder> seutje: thank, ill take a look
[05:59:02] <dwarder> thanks
[06:12:58] <mgreenberg> I have a page that has query 1.7 and 1.8 on it (not my doing don't ask)…I want to remove those and just drop in 1.10…any suggestions on a good way to go about this without causing too much grief ? I thought about writing test cases in jTestDriver but just trying not to make this too tedious if at all possible
[06:13:58] <Cork> mgreenberg: if you already have 1.8 loaded it should be quite easy to update to 1.10
[06:14:09] <dewp> hey guys. maybe any of you has a minute to help me out, i think i messed something basic up. my homepage works well on all desktop-pcs, but images where i implemented the parallax-plugin are not showed at all
[06:14:26] <Cork> mgreenberg: you might want to load the jquery-migrate library though
[06:14:37] <dewp> http://jdahl.de/sandbox/update/
[06:14:42] <Cork> mgreenberg: as the browser ua sniffer is removed
[06:14:48] <mgreenberg> Cork: have you used that before ?
[06:15:11] <dewp> that's the page. on iOS 6,7 Android 2,4 and Windows Phone 8 its not displayed correctly
[06:15:14] <Cork> mgreenberg: well temporally, but not in production
[06:15:15] <saucey> join #stripe
[06:15:45] <dewp> saucey, wow, is this a classical spam invite?  havent seen this for...12 years!
[06:15:47] <mgreenberg> I have no intention of using it in production. I want to just fix the errors
[06:16:07] <saucey> dewp: what do you mean
[06:16:13] <Cork> then migration is definitely a good middle step
[06:16:20] <dewp> you just wrote "join #stripe"
[06:16:26] <Cork> ?g jquery-migrate
[06:16:26] <b-ot> Cork: jquery/jquery-migrate · GitHub → https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/
[06:16:47] <mgreenberg> cool..thanks Cork..I'll give that a whirl
[06:17:05] <Cork> mgreenberg: check you console when the lib is loaded
[06:17:05] <dewp> captain cork :-)
[06:17:20] <Cork> it outputs deprecation warning there
[06:17:58] <mgreenberg> cork: that seems simple enough….can I hook that up a unit test ?
[06:18:13] <Cork> mgreenberg: think so
[06:18:58] <mgreenberg> cool…that would make it easier and less time consuming I think Cork
[06:19:36] <Cork> mgreenberg: jquery-migrate extends jquery with the functions that has been removed
[06:19:54] <Cork> so the way it is used should not change from normal jquery
[06:21:02] <mgreenberg> ok gotcha…so there shouldn't be any limitations on what I want to do then
[06:21:47] <Cork> mgreenberg: no jquery-migrate should make the needed changes quite easy to find
[06:22:01] <Cork> if you had been on 1.5 or older it would have been more of a hurdle
[06:22:07] <Cork> but 1.8+ is quite easy
[06:22:26] <mgreenberg> Cork: thats really all Im looking for…having 2 jquerys in the page scares me
[06:22:39] <Cork> mgreenberg: you can't really have two versions
[06:22:48] <Cork> unless you go to extraordinary length to do so
[06:22:54] <mgreenberg> I know that..this is something I inherited
[06:22:56] <Cork> cause the second one will overwrite the first one
[06:23:57] <mgreenberg> when I remove the 1st one the page breaks in some bad ways
[06:24:07] <Cork> mgreenberg: there is a coding standard change for jquery 1.9+, but the only one you must do is the removal of .live
[06:24:25] <Cork> mgreenberg: is it using noConflict() ?
[06:24:41] <Cork> cause if it is it would mean much more work
[06:32:19] <Quest> http://jsfiddle.net/SvdGr/3/  try moving from b2 to b1 .   it alerts         t1,b1,b1,   any solution?
[06:33:21] <joroci> it's t1 b1 b2 for me
[06:33:29] <joroci> oh the other way
[06:34:21] <Quest> it should be showing t1,b2,b1  if the element is moved from bottom to top box
[06:34:49] <joroci> yea
[06:34:58] <joroci> the problem is the element is still in b1
[06:36:11] <nafta> I have some ranks on my site, 12 of them, you can get to that rank once you achieve some points. Any idea you guys could give me in order to show an alert once the user gets to a new rank?
[06:36:13] <nafta> thanks
[06:36:18] <Quest> joroci,  but the previous move said it moved to b2
[06:36:59] <Quest> Velveeta,  ?^
[06:37:07] <joroci> yea but look at the dom it's still in b1
[06:37:14] <Quest> dhm
[06:37:21] <Quest> why it was not droped
[06:37:24] <Velveeta> ahoy mateys
[06:37:47] <Quest> joroci,  i think it was not dropped as it was not detached
[06:37:59] <kuter> bye all
[06:38:05] <Velveeta> bye kuter
[06:38:30] <joroci> you need to actually move the item
[06:40:39] <nafta> for example rank 1 goes from 10-199 and rank 2 goes from 200 to 499 problem is...how can I show an alert or a modal to welcome the user to the new rank....? because if I set it to show up when the user reaches 200...he could not reach 200...he could reach 210 or 220 depending on the points they get....and since I want to display the rank only when it changes...I could also read the rank...and if the text of that div equals "Rank 2" then show the alert...the
[06:40:39] <nafta> problem is...isn't it going to infinite loop until I change to the other rank? thanks
[06:41:17] <Quest> joroci,  solved it. http://jsfiddle.net/SvdGr/4/
[06:42:48] <Velveeta> nafta: presumably they're not making points ona  constant basis, but something triggers those points… just check, in the function that credits them with points, what their current rank # is, and what their current rank points are, and if the rank of their rank points != their rank number, message them and update their rank #
[06:43:38] <joroci> yea, told you, you need to actually replace the element position :)
[06:43:57] <Quest> thx
[06:44:33] <nafta> Velveeta: I could make a function to check rank and alert and insert it in the other functions that credit points..
[06:44:39] <nafta> :D
[06:44:44] <nafta> thanks a lot Velveeta as usual
[06:46:29] <Quest> joroci,  line 18, I only want to make the current .task element be revert: invalid     as I may have many more elements with class .task on the same page. I dont want to disable those too.    what are the ways by which i can handle it.   do it on id instead or use $this key word. I just want to revert it for the current request. the task may be moved to some other box later in future
[06:47:06] <nafta> I have come to the conclusion that programming or working on a laptop is just a matter of getting used to
[06:47:16] <nafta> of course a two monitor desktop setup is way better..
[06:47:28] <nafta> but I'm getting used at working on a laptop
[06:48:44] <converge> can someone tell me why this simple thing isnt working ? http://paste2.org/Gh4PdAtV
[06:49:35] <nafta> isn't it supposed to be on("click" ?
[06:49:55] <nafta> I'm not an expert but I've been trying to learn
[06:50:14] <joroci> nafta how do you know which element you are working on?
[06:50:23] <converge> nafta: i dont think so
[06:50:24] <nafta>    $("#acessar").on("click", function() { });
[06:50:36] <joroci> .click(function(){}); is ok
[06:50:41] <nafta> ah ok
[06:50:42] <nafta> sorry
[06:50:47] <joroci> it's just a short way
[06:50:53] <joroci> to add single click
[06:51:35] <joroci> converge what isn't working?
[06:51:44] <nafta> oh I understand
[06:52:00] <joroci> the click event
[06:52:01] <joroci> ?
[06:52:04] <converge> joroci: when I click in the "acessar" button, nothing happens
[06:52:18] <joroci> did you add the jquery script file?
[06:52:33] <converge> joroci: yes, had tested jquery befero too
[06:53:36] <joroci> your code should work
[06:53:39] <joroci> http://jsfiddle.net/aH2cg/
[06:53:54] <shoky> Quest: did you see the solution i gave you yesterday?
[06:54:12] <Velveeta> i know what the problem is, your id attribute isn't an english word, javascript breaks on non-english
[06:54:16] <nafta> problem is the selector
[06:54:19] <Velveeta> j/k :)
[06:54:24] <nafta> I think
[06:54:28] <joroci> :)
[06:54:53] <converge> Velveeta: acessar ? but there isnt acents or things like that.. its a normal word
[06:55:00] <joroci> the problem is computer can be **** sometimes :P
[06:55:04] <joroci> computers
[06:55:05] <shoky> Quest: the "revert" option can take a function. you have full control over when there is a revert and when there isn't
[06:55:09] <Velveeta> converge: it was a joke :D
[06:55:46] <converge> Velveeta: funy, I was thinking 'omg, how can he think that jquery understand english and not portuguese lol
[06:56:00] <Velveeta> heheheh
[06:56:06] <Quest> shoky,  i did
[06:56:31] <Velveeta> btw, converge, if you code still isn't working properly, it's written just fine, but it's out of order in that paste
[06:56:54] <Velveeta> if that's the actual order it is in your document, the dom node you're binding the event to doesn't exist yet at the time you're trying to bind it
[06:57:08] <Velveeta> move that script to below your html content, or else wrap it in a document.ready function
[06:57:29] <Velveeta> or you could attach the event listener to the document itself if that's dynamic content
[06:58:20] <converge> Velveeta: that's it, document ready fixed that. thanks a lot !!
[06:58:25] <Quest> shoky,  can you give the link again. i lost the logs.
[06:58:26] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[06:58:51] <shoky> Quest:  http://jsfiddle.net/4bmT9/54/
[07:00:28] <Quest> shoky,  line 12 makes the decision?  i want a boolean to make a decision . if true. drag. else no
[07:04:08] <Quest> brb
[07:04:33] <shoky> Quest: line 3 makes the final decision
[07:04:47] <Quest> hm
[07:04:52] <shoky> well, the decision whether to revert or not.
[07:05:29] <shoky> line 12~ is about whether to attach to a new parent
[07:05:32] <shoky> on drop
[07:06:00] <Velveeta> oh the joys of communicating between multiple disparate events
[07:06:12] <shoky> heh
[07:06:53] <shoky> Quest: to clarify, the drop event is fired before the revert event
[07:11:34] <BillCriswell> How do you guys feel about icon fonts?
[07:13:15] <xec_> better than images!
[07:13:31] <Quest> shoky,  hm
[07:15:35] <shwaiil> Q: I'm using iScroll (a javascript lib that creates a scroll). When the content have iframes, the touch to scroll stops working unless you slide on a non-iframe content. I wonder how to prevent that from happening ? Make the iframe inside the iscroll container not clickable. I tried e.preventDefault, etc! Thanks!
[07:15:52] <shwaiil> e.stopPropagation() nothing.
[07:16:00] <shwaiil> Any tips or advice would be nice :)
[07:17:42] <snover> shwaiil: stop using iframes
[07:18:30] <BillCriswell> xec_: Using them for a recent project. I think it's just the aliasing in Chrome that's making me not dig them.
[07:18:40] <shwaiil> snover: thanks for looking! I don't use it myself, as this is something generated from very populkar widges, such as, Tweets embed codes, or youtube videos, etc.
[07:19:00] <xec_> BillCriswell: let me guess. on windows? :(
[07:19:01] <shwaiil> In this project, it happens that there's such type of content.
[07:20:16] <BillCriswell> xec_: You bet.
[07:20:26] <BillCriswell> Definitely the hardest part to get used to at this new gig.
[07:22:06] <BillCriswell> I miss my OS X. =(
[07:36:38] <Velveeta> so as of a couple months ago, we started naming our releases after cheesy 90's bands, and putting an easter egg in each one that would display the release info and play a song from the band of that release name… this month's release is "color me badd" with "all 4 love" being the easter egg song :D
[07:40:32] <NoiseEee> fun Velveeta!
[07:40:39] <Velveeta> :D
[07:40:51] <Velveeta> and our easter egg is activated via the old konami code :D
[07:43:04] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Haha nice.
[07:44:28] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Snow - "Informer" is pretty terrible, could fit right in.
[07:44:34] <Velveeta> definitely
[07:44:56] <Velveeta> this month's main contenders were color me bad and chumbawumba… it was almost a 50/50 split on votes
[07:45:12] <chilversc_> anyone know if its possible to pause the dom in chrome? ie so that all events stop processing, even things like css :hover, etc so I can inspect the DOM at a specific state?
[07:46:10] <BillCriswell> I wonder where chumbawumba is today.
[07:46:13] <Velveeta> chilversc_: chrome supports a few dom mutation breakpoints you can set, but if you need to simulate various css pseudo-states, you can do so explicitly by applying the :hover state or whatever to an element, but i don't think there's a breakpoint that can be set to catch that event naturally
[07:46:41] <BillCriswell> Huh, broke up last year by the looks of things.
[07:46:54] <chilversc_> Velveeta: I was wanting to play around with css animations, etc
[07:47:30] <chilversc_> Velveeta: and dom breakpoints have the disadvantage that they fire immediatly on change, but I want it at the end of an animation
[07:47:35] <Velveeta> chilversc_: yeah i'm pretty sure there's not a way to catch that kind of stuff and make the debugger on those sorts of events, because they're not actually behavioral, they're presentational
[07:48:21] <Velveeta> yeah the dom breakpoints are mainly useful for when you have some dom transformation going on that you don't know the source of, so you can just go back through the call stack when it breaks on them
[07:48:47] <Velveeta> but for css transitional animations, those are handled outside of the js debugger, so there's no actual javascript to break on
[07:52:41] <weekendHopeful> Morning/afternoon. I'm looking into a grid plugin that will work with just javascript objects. I already have a separate call to get all of the database data: I just need something to parse and paginate. The API I'm working with doesn't allow for MySQL limit offset calls: all or nothing. Any recommended plugins?
[07:53:41] <DarsVaeda> if I .unwrap will the element be deleted or just put somewhere in the root?
[07:54:00] <shoky> `api unwrap
[07:54:00] <b-ot> shoky: .unwrap(): Remove the parents of the set of matched elements from the DOM, leaving the matched elements in their place. http://api.jquery.com/unwrap/
[07:54:13] <shoky> Remove.. from the DOM
[07:54:29] <DarsVaeda> yes I read that but it is not quite what happens for me
[07:54:49] <shoky> if you need help with it, jsfiddle it
[07:55:01] <DarsVaeda> sometimes in firebug I can see all those elements at the top of the page
[08:04:32] <cam> bob
[08:07:37] <Guest54531> shoky,  keeping this in mind of yours. i only want this to move if a certain boolean var is true.  + I also want to get the ids of  t1,b1,b2    that is moved element, initial parent and destination parent.  cant solve it
[08:07:42] <Guest54531> http://jsfiddle.net/4bmT9/58/ ^
[08:08:34] <Guest54531> shoky,  i dont want to mess with other parents or elements having same .class
[08:17:31] <joroci> Guest54531
[08:18:50] <joroci> you could select a box before you can actually move it
[08:21:12] <shoky> Guest54531 Quest.. http://jsfiddle.net/4bmT9/59/
[08:26:40] <petey> can anyone tell me why this darn class is not being added? http://jsbin.com/ODADoDU/2/
[08:26:41] <Guest54531> shoky, k
[08:26:53] <petey> When you mouse in on client tools, you should get a pop up menu
[08:29:46] <shoky> petey: the class is added, but it still has the other class with display:none too
[08:30:09] <gho5tjr> I'm trying to determine if we can drop jquery-ui from our project. Any idea of a good way to check for usages?
[08:30:21] <petey> ah okay
[08:30:23] <petey> That makes sense
[08:30:24] <petey> thanks
[08:30:29] <Guest54531> shoky,  hm... nice.   I have a question: how to solve line 18 in http://jsfiddle.net/SvdGr/6/         the $this thing.  you know what i want to do though..
[08:31:02] <shoky> petey: uhm also i think you have the mouseout/mousover switched
[08:31:11] <petey> haha yes I did
[08:31:16] <petey> sorry it's still early
[08:31:23] <sjk> Hi!
[08:33:17] <sjk> I have an anchor tag with class .boxinfo and the following jquery: $('.boxinfo).click(function(event){ alert('Hi'); });
[08:33:25] <shoky> Guest54531: no, i don't know what you want to do
[08:33:28] <sjk> This works fine, I get the alert dialog when clicking the link
[08:34:31] <Guest54531> shoky,  in line 18, I only want to make the  draggable element as    revert:invalid     (only the one that was being dragged)
[08:35:13] <sjk> But, if I replace that anchor tag with another one (also having class .boxinfo) using ajax .get, that click event doesn't work anymore
[08:35:29] <sjk> Should I expect weirdness like that when AJAX updating the page?
[08:35:44] <sjk> (Am I making sense?)
[08:35:51] <Guest54531> shoky,  I hope I made my self clear?
[08:35:52] <Velveeta> sjk: only if you directly bind an event listener to the element like you've done… it's only good for that specific element
[08:35:53] <shoky> Guest54531: you're going in circles. don't ask about a specific way of doing things that you think solves your problem. just ask about the actual problem you want to solve. what do you want happening when you drag, etc? don't talk about code or revert:invalid
[08:35:59] <shoky> Guest54531: you couldn't be more unclear
[08:36:21] <Velveeta> sjk: an element of the same class isn't the same element, so you lose that listener… however, you can bind your listener higher in the document and tell it to listen for clicks on that type of element, and it'll work when you swap out the element itself
[08:36:32] <Guest54531> shoky,  iam appreciating the solutions but iam trying to learn about outcomes too. and possibilities.
[08:36:45] <Velveeta> sjk: you can do something like this: $(document).on('click', '.boxinfo', function(){})
[08:36:52] <gho5tjr> sjk: you need to use .on
[08:36:58] <sjk> Ahh
[08:37:38] <BillCriswell> I hate when <tab> doesn't go to the next FIELD on a website if I'm leaving a tab.
[08:37:43] <BillCriswell> leaving an input*
[08:37:46] <Guest54531> is there a way for http://jsfiddle.net/SvdGr/7/  in line 18     to make the  draggable element as    revert:invalid     (only the one that was being dragged)
[08:37:56] <shoky> :\
[08:38:07] <sjk> Velveeta, gho5tjr that did it! Thank you :)
[08:38:14] <Guest54531> shoky,  am.. just curious
[08:38:20] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[08:38:33] <shoky> Guest54531: no idea what you're asking... what does it mean for an element that is NOT being dragged to be reverted?
[08:38:48] <shoky> Guest54531: only the dragged element can be reverted, or not reverted...
[08:40:52] <shoky> Guest54531: if you want to do something only to the dragged element, you can access it with ui.draggable and do whatever you want with it, and only it
[08:41:49] <cjm_> Hi Folks, how do I find a DOM node within a previously selected subset?
[08:41:53] <Guest54531> shoky,  ok. lets say it by this way.   http://jsfiddle.net/SvdGr/8/         line 18.      now what ever line 18 is doing to all the elements that have .task class.     it should only be done to the current element dragged. not to all .task classed elements
[08:42:44] <Guest54531> shoky,  yes.   ui.draggable({ revert: "invalid"  });         does not work
[08:42:44] <shoky> cjm_: .filter and/or .find would be a good place to start
[08:42:59] <shoky> Guest54531: ui.draggable is a jquery element, not a function
[08:43:03] <cjm_> shoky, Thanks very much.
[08:43:32] <Guest54531> shoky,  then what to do
[08:44:32] <shoky> Guest54531: to set options on a draggable you can call  .draggable('option', 'revert', 'invalid') on it, for example
[08:44:42] <shoky> ui.draggable is a draggable
[08:45:23] <Guest54531>   $('#'+movedElementId).draggable({ revert: "invalid"  });     ?
[08:45:32] <shoky> ui.draggable is a draggable
[08:45:55] <shoky> Guest54531: to set options on a draggable you can call  .draggable('option', 'revert', 'invalid') on it, for example

[08:53:16] <cjm_> Hi Folks, what is returned in the event of no match?  eg: var $x = $("#non-existent-element");   Is $x null, undefined or something else?
[08:54:22] <BillCriswell> cjm_: an empty array.
[08:54:41] <Soltis> cjm_: It will be a selector which didn't match anything, which functions as an empty array.
[08:55:43] <cjm_> BillCriswell, Soltis . So $x.length == 0?
[08:55:56] <BillCriswell> Yurp.
[08:56:11] <cjm_> BillCriswell, Thrnks.
[08:56:20] <cjm_> BillCriswell, (-:
[08:56:31] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:57:04] <Soltis> cjm_: Mind you that if you are having to do tests like that it *usually* (but not always) means you're misusing jQuery.
[08:58:42] <Guest54531> shoky,  is this correct $(ui.draggable).attr('id').draggable({ revert: "valid"  });            or         this         ui.draggable.draggable({ revert: "valid"  });
[09:00:50] <jonny41> dvd
[09:03:36] <cjm_> Soltis, In this case, I am debugging.  I need to see that my selectors are doing what I think they are doing, so I am throwing an exception in the event .length == 0.  This code will be removed after debugging.
[09:04:03] <Soltis> cjm_: Better: console.log(mysel)
[09:04:26] <Soltis> I.e. var mysel = $(...); console.log(mysel);
[09:04:55] <cjm_> Soltis, Yes.  In most cases.  It requires that you look at the console.  Since I'm moving stuff around I want to be aware that I changed something.
[09:05:28] <Soltis> cjm_: Gotcha. I usually trace things by crazy over-application of print statements, but that's probably because I grew up on C and perl
[09:06:01] <Soltis> cjm_: (And Linus's kernel debugger rant really made a big influence on me)
[09:06:30] <cjm_> Soltis, Which one was that?  (-:
[09:06:35] <BillCriswell> Nerd alert!
[09:06:55] <cjm_> alert("Nerd!");
[09:07:20] <Soltis> cjm_: http://www.linuxtoday.com/infrastructure/2000090700221OSCYKN
[09:08:32] <Soltis> Especially this line: "Oh. And sure, when things crash and you fsck and you didn't even get a clue about what went wrong, you get frustrated. Tough. There are two kinds of reactions to that: you start being careful, or you start whining about a kernel debugger."
[09:21:21] <petey> so when I run a .text it removes the link element
[09:21:30] <Dlabz> hi, guys. When I set $.cookie("name", "token") on a site running on a port 8020, $.getCookie("name") doesn't work, as cookie is set with name "name8020". Any simple way to make my code port-independent?
[09:21:33] <petey> is there anyway I can target just the first child link element without overcomplicating things?
[09:21:33] <petey> http://jsbin.com/ODADoDU/4/edit
[09:21:55] <petey> it replaces the text like I'm asking it to, but not entirely
[09:22:11] <petey> I tried .find('a') but it targets the items in the list inside of it too
[09:23:52] <petey> $(this).children(':first-child').text() seems to do the trick but is that too much?
[09:46:33] <Guest54531>  iam doing   if(boolean return from some ajax method) {do something}       but it seems that the if () always gets false.. even if the ajax method returns true. I think that the true is returned inside the success:  of  ajax call. and it takes time. while the if() gets no true boolean. ?
[09:49:23] <Guest54531> http://pastie.org/8466016#50        line 52 is the call. method at top
[09:54:34] <nafta> Rohan_Bhangui: lol
[09:54:38] <nafta> it won't let me message you
[09:54:42] <nafta> it says you are offline
[09:54:45] <nafta> are you Neo?
[09:54:46] <shoky> Guest54531: ajax is asynchronous, you can't return things from the callbacks. you must use callbacks to do stuff after the ajax is finished, you can return the $.ajax itself and call .done and .fail on it: http://pastie.org/8466029
[09:55:01] <shoky> ?ajax101
[09:55:02] <b-ot> shoky: Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://oi41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.jpg and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41

[09:55:15] <shoky> er Guest54531
[09:55:16] <Guest54531> shoky,  thanks
[09:55:23] <nafta> Rohan_Bhangui: YES I am...but I can't write you back
[09:55:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[09:55:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> swtich to google hangout nafta
[09:55:35] <nafta> hold on let me close it
[09:56:47] <shoky> Guest54531: and about your earlier question... what was not clear about what i said?  ui.draggable.draggable('option', 'revert', 'invalid')
[09:57:39] <Guest54531> shoky,  just got too tired and disturbed. trying all and learning what you said
[10:32:37] <anEffingChamp> omen make no sense to me.
[10:36:27] <BillCriswell> What is omen?
[10:54:08] <grafi> nomen est omen
[11:13:44] <Ansikt> What's wrong with this function?  http://pastie.org/8466180
[11:13:54] <Ansikt> There are no errors, and it runs fine once.
[11:14:13] <Ansikt> But the second time I run it, only the transition of right will work, not the left transition.
[11:15:13] <Ansikt> Sorry, I had that backwards.  Only .animate({left:"0px"}) will run, not .animate({right:"100%"})
[11:19:33] <Ansikt> Fixed it.  Don't know why it didn't work before, but I changed 'right':'100%' to 'left' :'-100%' and now it's a-okay
[11:20:00] <audioteks> Hey guys, having problem with the load method
[11:20:18] <audioteks> I'm trying to insert the mainwrapper of a website but it's not showing up
[11:24:12] <Ansikt> audioteks: I don't know what you mean by 'mainwrapper'.  Are you using some sort of prefab framework?
[11:24:27] <Ansikt> and/or can you provide an example in a jsfiddle or whatever?
[11:27:45] <BillCriswell> Ansikt: right: null; might be kind of weird?
[11:27:59] <BillCriswell> I think default for right would be auto?
[11:28:51] <Ansikt> BillCriswell: I don't want auto though, I want to unset the variable.
[11:29:41] <BillCriswell> Ansikt: It's CSS though.
[11:30:10] <BillCriswell> Setting it to auto is the same as unsetting it
[11:31:00] <Ansikt> This says I should just use an empty string.  Also, auto in some cases can be different than the default (such as with block element widths).  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4036857/jquery-remove-style-added-with-css-function
[11:33:35] <Ansikt> Also, 'auto' can break inherit and cascade.
[11:35:38] <BillCriswell> Hm, never ran into issues with it.
[11:37:23] <TheEternalAbyss> hello, i was wondering... I have an index.php where I include my js and jquery through a </php include 'include/js.php'; ?> and then through ajax calls I load my content from various other .php files. one. Why would one of these other .php files say a function (that is in jquery) is not a function when the file was included?
[11:37:41] <TheEternalAbyss> sorry I mean <?php etc etc
[11:37:48] <BillCriswell> audioteks: You using .wrapAll() ?
[11:38:50] <TheEternalAbyss> specifically it's a jquery ui function that won't work
[11:38:53] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: Hard to say, could be something as simple as a type.
[11:39:00] <BillCriswell> typo*
[11:39:12] <BillCriswell> I typo that word so often.
[11:39:25] <TheEternalAbyss> well I'm just wondering about scoping of includes
[11:39:44] <TheEternalAbyss> once it's included it should be accessible by all pages loaded within that session right?
[11:43:39] <kennen> Hi, i am using jquery mobile and got some trouble with the UI Loader. Every time i call the loader from my own function function show(){$.mobile.loading( 'show');} i got: this.loaderWidget is undefined
[11:45:28] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: I'm not sure I'm following.
[11:46:57] <TheEternalAbyss> this is the main issue: I am trying to clean up code from another dev and he include jquery and jquery ui one like 20 pages. I thought you could include it once and be done but it seems to break the pages
[11:49:02] <TheEternalAbyss> on like*
[11:49:20] <TheEternalAbyss> it seems to break the pages if I remove those includes
[11:51:01] <TheEternalAbyss> loading the libraries over and over again seems horrible to me and impacts performance
[11:53:27] <TheEternalAbyss> any ideas how to include the jquery only once for all pages to access?
[11:55:02] <TheEternalAbyss> brb
[11:57:03] <audioteknika> Hey guys, I need help with the load method : http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=lIPysSevsv
[11:57:12] <audioteknika> if someone wants to give me a hand
[12:00:18] <nafta> Velveeta: you around? I have a div with images..inside....<img src=/images/game-1/image-1.jpg /> I share those images on click...to twitter...no problems there....what I want to do is find a way to feed that div with images I add to that directory
[12:00:26] <nafta> do I have to use ajax..etc.. ?
[12:00:43] <nafta> I feel this is such a dumb question...since the answer is going to be yes
[12:01:55] <BillCriswell> audioteknika: What's the issue?
[12:02:09] <audioteknika> I can't load a particular address
[12:02:13] <audioteknika> nothing shows up
[12:02:16] <audioteknika> in my div..
[12:02:40] <BillCriswell> audioteknika: You can't load content from a domain that isn't yours with just Javascript sadly.
[12:03:07] <audioteknika> Oh
[12:03:08] <BillCriswell> You can't load content from a different domain than the one the script is running on.*
[12:03:16] <s5fs> audioteknika: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18149200/changing-the-access-control-allow-origin-to-allow-jquery-load-to-work
[12:03:16] <audioteknika> Ok, well that explains it
[12:03:18] <BillCriswell> If you know php you can get around it pretty easily.
[12:03:30] <audioteknika> cant use php
[12:03:56] <s5fs> audioteknika: any server-side processing will work. you need to proxy the request through your own server, if that makes sense.
[12:04:42] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I just default to php because it's popular.
[12:05:29] <audioteknika> Thanks everyone
[12:10:28] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[12:13:08] <Bloomberg> Hello Guys!!
[12:14:13] <Bloomberg> I need to get an array from php for to fill the data with autocomplete jquery ui!
[12:14:24] <Bloomberg> Someone has made some like this and can help me?
[12:15:20] <jedimind> sigh
[12:17:19] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Check out json_encode() in PHP.
[12:18:31] <TheEternalAbyss> back
[12:18:37] <TheEternalAbyss> so really no suggestions?
[12:23:08] <duch_kazatel> TheEternalAbyss on what?
[12:23:40] <TheEternalAbyss> i want to include jquery and jquery ui only once in my index and load content through ajax calls to ohter php files
[12:23:56] <TheEternalAbyss> it's saying jquery ui is not loaded
[12:23:59] <duch_kazatel> jqueryui has to init on load i think.
[12:24:07] <kennen> Im trying to make my website multilaguage, in some javascript i need language output to, php creats for ma a json string what i want to parse with jquery
[12:24:52] <kennen> at the moment im using "parseJSON(json).KEY" but is ther a way to make this more flexible, so i can write a function maybe function foo(bar){return parseJSON( json ).bar}?
[12:24:58] <duch_kazatel> TheEternalAbyss why do you want to do that anyway? shouldn't be an idea.
[12:25:19] <TheEternalAbyss> i get an error saying .tabs() is not a funciton, .tabs() is in jquery-ui, I loaded it in my index, but now i have to inslude it in the .php file i loading in my ajax call
[12:25:47] <TheEternalAbyss> because I have a lot of code, multiple php files and i can't have 4 second loads per click because it reload jquery ui eveyr time
[12:25:57] <TheEternalAbyss> every*
[12:26:02] <duch_kazatel> holy cripes.
[12:26:29] <duch_kazatel> sounds like there's something else going on.  are you removing the JS via your setup somehow?
[12:26:41] <TheEternalAbyss> no
[12:26:53] <duch_kazatel> are you overwriting the tabs then?
[12:26:55] <TheEternalAbyss> just include, ajax call, and post data
[12:27:23] <TheEternalAbyss> but it won't load the tabs now cause I only have my jquery included in my index.php
[12:27:55] <duch_kazatel> right, because jqui has to init.
[12:28:17] <TheEternalAbyss> excuse my ignorance, but why does it need ot init again if I already did that on load of index.php?
[12:28:24] <TheEternalAbyss> to*
[12:28:34] <duch_kazatel> because you're probably replacing the DOM content.
[12:28:43] <duch_kazatel> it's likely you'll have to change most of your logic to update things instead of replace them,.
[12:28:54] <duch_kazatel> but without seeing your setup it's hard to know exactly what's going on.
[12:29:21] <TheEternalAbyss> sorry what do you mean in regards to update vs replace
[12:29:29] <TheEternalAbyss> i want to make sure I understand
[12:29:57] <duch_kazatel> is your ajax call replacing everything in <body>?
[12:30:16] <TheEternalAbyss> not everything no, a specific div container
[12:30:40] <duch_kazatel> and things inside that container are then breaking as a result?
[12:31:05] <TheEternalAbyss> yes
[12:31:15] <TheEternalAbyss> not fully loading cause it appears to have missing libraries
[12:31:38] <duch_kazatel> the libs are likely still there, but you're losing the relationships that happen when jqui inits
[12:31:49] <duch_kazatel> but i'm not terribly familiar with jqui so i could be off.
[12:32:07] <TheEternalAbyss> hmm how odd... i'm not rewriting the whole page though..
[12:32:50] <duch_kazatel> doesn't matter.  depending on how jqui binds its events, you're losing the bindings with the dom nodes.
[12:33:08] <TheEternalAbyss> well crap..
[12:33:12] <TheEternalAbyss> :\
[12:33:29] <duch_kazatel> so you're getting 4 second pageloads?
[12:33:46] <duch_kazatel> if you remove all your javascript, does it reduce the pageload time a huge amount?
[12:33:47] <thrushaa> jqui doesn't bind to anything on jquery init. but calling $(selector).tabs(); will then init and bind tabs events to that selector
[12:33:49] <TheEternalAbyss> yea actually longer, but it's due to other things as well
[12:33:55] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[12:34:01] <duch_kazatel> thrushaa - thank you.
[12:34:11] <TheEternalAbyss> thrushaa: it's not binding though
[12:34:37] <thrushaa> I missed the start, are you loading js too?
[12:35:06] <TheEternalAbyss> I'm loading jquery, jquery ui, jquery datatables and my own js file for my ajax calls
[12:35:25] <duch_kazatel> are those getting loaded into the <head> of the page?
[12:35:27] <duch_kazatel> or somewhere else?
[12:35:31] <TheEternalAbyss> in index
[12:35:36] <thrushaa> ok, and does the ajax load more js which is run?
[12:35:38] <duch_kazatel> where in index?
[12:35:59] <TheEternalAbyss> what do you mean where is index
[12:36:05] <duch_kazatel> *in
[12:36:16] <duch_kazatel> the <head>?  in <body>?
[12:36:17] <TheEternalAbyss> oh.. sorry
[12:36:20] <TheEternalAbyss> head yea
[12:36:24] <duch_kazatel> okay
[12:36:33] <TheEternalAbyss> thrushaa: just my ajax functions
[12:36:57] <TheEternalAbyss> so they are initialized and I can invoke them in my pages
[12:37:47] <thrushaa> just to be clear. you are definitely not adding in another copy of jQuery?
[12:38:05] <TheEternalAbyss> well, not in my index.php file
[12:38:27] <thrushaa> yeah, but maybe when you inject to new stuff via ajax?
[12:38:34] <TheEternalAbyss> because if this issue the other devs have added to other php files includes for jquery, which i'm trying to get rid of
[12:38:54] <TheEternalAbyss> yea some injections have includes in them
[12:39:14] <TheEternalAbyss> but they are workign with the includes. I remove them it breaks
[12:39:29] <thrushaa> if you request and inject html which includes only jquery.js it will wipe out all other includes like jqui
[12:39:53] <duch_kazatel> but that means he'll have jquery on the same page twice.
[12:39:55] <TheEternalAbyss> so from what I gather I should just remove all includes except for my first include
[12:40:13] <duch_kazatel> you should only load libs once.
[12:40:17] <duch_kazatel> and leave them there.
[12:40:23] <duch_kazatel> like, don't have your ajax remove them.
[12:40:25] <thrushaa> yeah, absolutely
[12:40:30] <TheEternalAbyss> yea, i have no idea why my coworker did that
[12:40:49] <TheEternalAbyss> there's like 30 includes here, 1 in 30 files
[12:40:53] <TheEternalAbyss> -_-
[12:41:01] <thrushaa> by default there can only be one window.$ live on a page… unless you do stuff with noConflict
[12:41:34] <TheEternalAbyss> let me comment out the includes in the injected pages and see if it all works lol
[12:41:44] <TheEternalAbyss> thanks very much for all the clarification
[12:44:48] <b0nn> sacho: I found the problem, it was what you were saying. The java backend was expecting several different strings to be passed to it, but I was only passing two. I had a ssumed that it would ignore the fact that it got different input than expected.
[12:48:57] <stongo> anyone had much experience with the fullcalendar plugin?
[12:49:36] <stongo> it's creating unresponsive warnings in FF in sometimes taking a really long time in IE
[12:50:17] <Patrycjusz> hi, i want create someting like science glass bootle with flying bubbles. I need this little animation to be a link.
[12:50:28] <Patrycjusz> What i should use ? jquery ?
[12:50:46] <Patrycjusz> i dont want flash
[12:51:08] <TheEternalAbyss> why not just html with css3 animations
[12:51:56] <Patrycjusz> TheEternalAbyss: i want this bubbles flying from the bootle constantly
[12:52:17] <Patrycjusz> i saw once example of flying bees
[12:52:18] <TheEternalAbyss> yea.. all you need is a little js for a loop
[12:52:47] <TheEternalAbyss> you don't really need a whole library for a loop or so
[12:53:01] <Patrycjusz> do you have any links where i can find tutorias, examples like this ?
[12:53:04] <TheEternalAbyss> but you could use jquery to control a few things
[12:53:26] <TheEternalAbyss> hmm one moment
[12:53:32] <Patrycjusz> im not good programmer but i can do things from tutorials
[12:54:51] <TheEternalAbyss> http://www.kirupa.com/html5/looping_a_css_transition.htm
[12:55:00] <TheEternalAbyss> search engines are your friend
[12:55:15] <TheEternalAbyss> you may have to tweak that to animate on load
[12:55:25] <TheEternalAbyss> but overall that's the principle of it
[12:56:12] <Patrycjusz> TheEternalAbyss: im much closer now :-) thanks. Keep searching
[12:56:20] <TheEternalAbyss> no problem
[12:56:30] <TheEternalAbyss> basically you just do your animation once
[12:56:42] <TheEternalAbyss> then use js or jquery to make it loop
[12:56:56] <TheEternalAbyss> not too crazy really
[12:57:50] <Patrycjusz> it would be hard to do for example three bubbles coming out from a bootle and animate different sizes and directions ?
[12:57:59] <TheEternalAbyss> nope
[12:58:03] <TheEternalAbyss> just more css
[12:58:15] <TheEternalAbyss> and whatever htm containers you need to hold the objects
[12:58:18] <TheEternalAbyss> html*
[12:58:22] <Patrycjusz> nope mean yes ? :-)
[12:58:31] <TheEternalAbyss> it's not harder
[12:58:36] <TheEternalAbyss> just more to type
[12:58:41] <Patrycjusz> ok
[12:58:50] <Patrycjusz> thanks so much
[12:58:57] <TheEternalAbyss> you're welcome
[12:59:01] <Patrycjusz> i will have a fun night
[12:59:05] <TheEternalAbyss> hehe
[12:59:31] <Patrycjusz> it is better than play diablo #
[12:59:40] <Patrycjusz> diablo 3
[12:59:54] <TheEternalAbyss> well I heard diablo 3 is pretty darned good though..
[13:00:36] <Patrycjusz> i played D1 for 2 years D2 for 6 years and D3 for one\no more
[13:02:49] <TheEternalAbyss> wow
[13:04:57] <BillCriswell> The amount of effort I put into thinking about my HTML can't possibly be worth it.
[13:05:26] <TheEternalAbyss> BillCriswell: you get paid for your work on html?
[13:05:32] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[13:05:39] <TheEternalAbyss> then it's worth it
[13:05:50] <TheEternalAbyss> :3
[13:05:55] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: It drives me nuts though.
[13:06:35] <TheEternalAbyss> yea it can
[13:06:56] <BillCriswell> I have a 3 events here. My gut tells me 3 events should be an "ordered list" but I have this weird thing where I don't like putting header elements into list items.
[13:07:12] <TheEternalAbyss> ah
[13:08:02] <BillCriswell> An event could warrant it's own section as well... but it seems weird nesting <section> elements that closely? I dunno.
[13:08:24] <TheEternalAbyss> hmm yea dunno
[13:08:32] <TheEternalAbyss> really depends on what you are trying to do really
[13:09:49] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: That's the thing, I think the structure of the HTML shouldn't need to be adjusted based on something visual either.
[13:09:59] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: I probably just think about it way too fucking hard.
[13:10:21] <TheEternalAbyss> well... yea visually html should be only basic layout and a skeleton for the styles
[13:11:42] * TheEternalAbyss blinks
[13:11:56] <TheEternalAbyss> how did my server all of a sudden start going ass ripping fast?
[13:12:19] <TheEternalAbyss> i was getting 5s load time and not I got 500ms tops
[13:12:22] <BillCriswell> "ass ripping fast" is an interesting analogy
[13:12:25] <TheEternalAbyss> and now*
[13:12:29] <duch_kazatel> lmao i was about to say that.
[13:12:36] <duch_kazatel> "ass ripping fast".
[13:12:38] <duch_kazatel> eatin' beans
[13:12:41] <TheEternalAbyss> ^^
[13:12:44] <TheEternalAbyss> that's fast
[13:12:48] <TheEternalAbyss> 0=)
[13:14:57] <TheEternalAbyss> er well maybe I spoke to soon.. slowed down again..
[13:14:59] <TheEternalAbyss> :\
[13:18:54] <TheEternalAbyss> k, i'm off. thanks again for the help. bye
[13:23:37] <BillCriswell> Later.
[13:23:56] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell: man I have a  problem
[13:24:11] <Bloomberg> I already can to do the query to php with autocomplete
[13:24:58] <Bloomberg> But the problem is that when I type something in the input always bring me the same 10 initiall records of DB
[13:25:32] <Bloomberg> The php function is for query a DB and get the records, (There are like 150 aprox)
[13:25:52] <Bloomberg> And according I type in input text never change it
[13:25:54] <Bloomberg> You know why?
[13:27:03] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: I'm not super familiar with autocomplete. =(
[13:27:46] <Bloomberg> But you have idea what will be the problem?
[13:29:12] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote How close is your code to the code the page shows if you click the "View Source" link?
[13:35:32] <EGreg> hey guys
[13:35:39] <EGreg> how do I get like .outerHTML
[13:35:42] <EGreg> basically including the container
[13:36:04] <EGreg> how is .html() different from [0].innerHTML
[13:36:36] <thrushaa> you can do .parent().html()
[13:40:41] <BillCriswell> EGreg: $('.foo')[0].outerHTML could work, what thrushaa said might be a little safer.
[13:40:54] <BillCriswell> Not sure on browser support for outerHTML to be honest.
[13:41:39] <thrushaa> heh, I just use jQuery, why would we ever want to use native properties ;)
[13:42:27] <dcherman2> BillCriswell: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.outerHTML - pretty well supported.
[13:42:48] <BillCriswell> thrushaa: To make someone way to obsessed with tiny performance enhancements happy.
[13:43:07] <BillCriswell> dcherman2: Haha, shit. I'd say so.
[13:43:15] <BillCriswell> Chrome: 0.2
[13:43:15] <dcherman2> thrushaa: because in your example, if you have any sibling elements then .parent().html() is not the correct way of getting .outerHTML
[13:43:44] <thrushaa> true true
[13:43:49] <dcherman2> and if you really want jquery, then just do elem.prop( "outerHTML" ).  there you go.
[13:43:51] <BillCriswell> dcherman2: Are the siblings adopted?
[13:43:53] <dcherman2> its the same thing
[13:44:12] <BillCriswell> chilversc_: I get it now.
[13:44:16] <BillCriswell> dcherman2: *
[13:44:22] <BillCriswell> sorry chilversc_.
[13:52:09] <nafta> I know this is a plugin question but...this is function mSwiper.clickedSlide.html() returns this -> <img src="images/image-1.jpg" />
[13:52:18] <nafta> how could I trim that in order to get only the filename?
[13:54:16] <BillCriswell> nafta: src.slice( src.lastIndexOf('/'), src.length );
[13:54:32] <BillCriswell> nafta: Err... src.slice( src.lastIndexOf('/') + 1, src.length );
[13:54:58] <BillCriswell> Maybe even src.split('/').slice(-1)[0]
[13:55:29] <Velveeta> yeah that's more of a regex/string parsing question vs a plugin question :)
[13:57:52] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: https://github.com/rtimothy/console.bro
[13:58:32] <Velveeta> i bet that project is totally ripped and tanned out
[13:59:07] <BillCriswell> totally
[13:59:34] <ryanissamson1> Hey there, would be grateful if someone could point out what I'm doing wrong here. :) http://pastebin.com/AvsGwr3x
[13:59:56] <ryanissamson1> I think the issue is with the slider var syntax.
[14:00:12] <kennen> How the can i load dynamic pages with jquery mobile with style and every think else? im goolge around since a few hours but cant find a solution :(
[14:01:19] <BillCriswell> ryanissamson1: And errors?
[14:01:40] <ryanissamson1> BillCriswell:Uncaught ReferenceError: slider is not defined
[14:01:51] <ryanissamson1> Wait, maybe I'm doing the same thing over that I shouldn't be...
[14:02:07] <BillCriswell> ryanissamson1: I think you want var slider line down a line.
[14:02:14] <ryanissamson1> Is rightImageSelect returning a height?
[14:02:17] <ryanissamson1> ah
[14:02:27] <BillCriswell> Actually, up 3 lines.
[14:02:44] <BillCriswell> Actually.. down 2
[14:02:46] <BillCriswell> sorry, Friday.
[14:02:49] <ryanissamson1> :-/ heh
[14:03:06] <BillCriswell> Basically, var slider should nto be in the callback of filter
[14:03:19] <ryanissamson1> I'm trying to filter images within a div by ones greater than 10px height and then set another div to that height.
[14:03:23] <ryanissamson1> okay
[14:03:33] <ryanissamson1> Oh yea!
[14:03:35] <ryanissamson1> I see that now
[14:04:14] <ryanissamson1> BillCriswell:it works!
[14:04:17] <ryanissamson1> BillCriswell++
[14:04:32] <BillCriswell> Awesome.
[14:04:47] <ryanissamson1> BillCriswell:otherwise, does my syntax look pretty good? I'm a jQuery newbie. :)
[14:05:53] <ryanissamson1> BillCriswell: should the $(document).ready(sliderfix); and $(window).resize(sliderfix); be at the bottom like that? I'm wanting the code to fire on both events and that's what I found on stack exchange
[14:06:20] <nafta> BillCriswell: how could I apply the trim?
[14:06:25] <kennen> can please someone help me with my dynamic pages problem in jquery mobile?
[14:07:49] <BillCriswell> nafta: $.trim( ... )
[14:08:55] <nafta> BillCriswell: this is my var var imageDiv = tSwiper.clickedSlide.html();
[14:09:13] <BillCriswell> ryanissamson1: That seems ok to me.
[14:09:14] <nafta> so then...$.trim(imageDiv)
[14:09:24] <BillCriswell> nafta: Yes.
[14:09:29] <ryanissamson1> BillCriswell++
[14:09:41] <nafta> BillCriswell: but what about all the other things?
[14:10:04] <nafta> the  src.slice( src.lastIndexOf('/') + 1, src.length );
[14:10:53] <BillCriswell> nafta: Are these things related?
[14:11:28] <nafta> oh yes..lol sorry...this var imageDiv = tSwiper.clickedSlide.html(); returns this -> <img src="images/image-1.jpg" />
[14:11:36] <nafta> which is what I want to trim or slice
[14:11:43] <nafta> to get only the file name image-1.jpg
[14:11:56] <nafta> note that image-1.jpg is dynamic
[14:12:04] <nafta> it could be image-2
[14:12:16] <nafta> or porn-1.jpg
[14:13:07] <BillCriswell> nafta: You could do like... var src = tSwiper.clickedSlide.find('img').attr('src');
[14:13:16] <BillCriswell> Then use my code.
[14:13:27] <BillCriswell> Not sure you'd need to trim?
[14:14:05] <nafta> if that returns only the image file
[14:14:09] <nafta> I wouldn't have to trim anything
[14:14:35] <BillCriswell> nafta: Yes.
[14:17:35] <nafta> BillCriswell: hrmm this ain't working         var imageDiv = tSwiper.clickedSlide.find('img').attr('src');
[14:17:52] <BillCriswell> Why is this variable named imageDiv?
[14:18:16] <BillCriswell> nafta: How about just this? var src = tSwiper.clickedSlide.find('img').attr('src').split('/').slice(-1)[0]; that'll return just image-1.jpg
[14:20:35] <nafta> lemme check
[14:22:43] <lostkauze__> not really a jquery question per se, but how would you go around adding a highscore database to an online game made in jQuery?
[14:23:04] <nafta> BillCriswell: almost! I'm getting image-2.jpg">
[14:23:30] <nafta> with this -> var imageDiv = (tSwiper.clickedSlide.html()).split('/').slice(-1)[0];
[14:25:15] <BillCriswell> nafta: That's not the code I gave you.
[14:27:40] <BillCriswell> nafta: var src = tSwiper.clickedSlide.find('img').attr('src').split('/').slice(-1)[0];
[14:28:33] <`teh1> is there a way to do, for example, $(foo).on('click',':not(.bar)',function(){}); ?
[14:28:45] <`teh1> so when you click on foo and it does not have the bar class
[14:29:06] <`teh1> or do i have to make that check within the function
[14:29:42] <BillCriswell> `teh1: This is one of those things you should just try... but yes, that'll work.
[14:29:59] <`teh1> BillCriswell:  well im asking because that specifically isnt working
[14:31:05] <BillCriswell> `teh1: What's foo?
[14:31:11] <petey> can anyone tell me what's going on here? A) I'm getting a script error (line 0) and B) I'm trying to write a function once an input box hits over 2 keys.
[14:31:14] <petey> http://jsbin.com/aWazOHu/1/edit
[14:31:17] <`teh1> '#foo'
[14:31:38] <petey> It worked fine, but now that I have two input boxes instead of 1, I decided to write a function that checks to see if there is more than 2 letters and it stopped working :(
[14:31:39] <BillCriswell> Oh so you want that to happen when foo isn't .bar, I thought foo was like the document or something
[14:31:54] <petey> I think I'm having trouble with $(this)
[14:32:01] <Patrycjusz> TheEternalAbyss: are you still here ?
[14:32:29] <`teh1> BillCriswell:  sorry i wasnt clear enough. foo/bar/baz usually refers to specific hypothetical "things" :p
[14:33:06] <Patrycjusz> anyone can help me with jquery animate ?
[14:33:09] <BillCriswell> `teh1: You could do like... $(document).on('click', '#foo:not(.bar)', function(){ });
[14:34:13] <BillCriswell> `teh1: The 2nd argument for on I think is only good on the child elements.
[14:34:21] <`teh1> actually yeah IDK why i didn't do that, as foo is a selector and not a selected element xD
[14:34:30] <`teh1> thanks. was derpy of me.
[14:34:58] <nafta> BillCriswell: this won't alert anything ->         var imageDiv = tSwiper.clickedSlide.find('img').attr('src').split('/').slice(-1)[0];
[14:35:14] <nafta> that's why I was trying to tweak it
[14:35:19] <`teh1> thankie. pce.
[14:35:47] <nafta> now this ->         var imageDiv = (tSwiper.clickedSlide.html()).split('/').slice(-1)[0]; returns something
[14:36:04] <nafta> this-> image-2.jpg">

I can't seem to remove this characters...wtf...this function -> tSwiper.clickedSlide.html() returns this ->  <img src="images/image-1.jpg" />, I'm doing this (tSwiper.clickedSlide.html()).split('/').slice(-1 , 2); and now I'm getting this -> image-1.jpg" > but I can't seem to remove " and >
[14:53:31] <nafta> Patrycjusz: wait patiently, the guys here are amazing..
[14:55:04] <Patrycjusz> nafta: thanks i will :-)
[15:00:47] <petey> I figured it out. I wasn't passing in $(this) yay
[15:05:03] <grafi> `ask @ Patrycjusz
[15:05:04] <b-ot> Patrycjusz: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:05:48] <grafi> nafta do you have that as a fiddle?
[15:05:55] <nafta> man this is just retarded
[15:06:00] <Patrycjusz>  i need help with animation on the path. Need to make bubbles flying from bootle. I found this: http://jqbezier.ericlesch.com/  http://jsbin.com/onavaq/1360/edit . This is great but i need change some scc in this loop. I need the dot starting width: 2px height: 2px and finish 30x30px and opacity: 0
[15:06:06] <nafta> grafi not a working fiddle
[15:06:12] <nafta> but hold on
[15:06:15] <grafi> nafta well obviously :p
[15:06:16] <nafta> let me upload it
[15:06:21] <nafta> lol
[15:10:08] <nafta> grafi: http://jsfiddle.net/UgKmG/
[15:10:57] <Velveeta> nafta: wrap that img tag text in a jquery function first, then just grab its .attr('src') and then parse out the file name
[15:11:39] <grafi> Patrycjusz http://jsbin.com/onavaq/1361/ this looks like it does something
[15:13:06] <Velveeta> tSwiper.clickedSlide.children(':first').attr('src').split('/').slice(-1)
[15:13:14] <grafi> also include jquery xD
[15:13:16] <Velveeta> ^^ nafta
[15:13:28] <grafi> and swiper
[15:13:29] <grafi> ^^
[15:13:42] <Patrycjusz> grafi: tomorrow ill buy best book to learn jquery :-)
[15:13:43] <Patrycjusz> thanks
[15:13:45] <Velveeta> swiper no swiping
[15:14:02] <grafi> Patrycjusz np
[15:15:35] <nafta> Velveeta: it alerts nadda
[15:15:49] <nafta> this is so weird
[15:16:02] <Velveeta> so clip function calls from the end and console.log them in turn to see where it's going wrong
[15:18:43] <nafta> Velveeta: always the console giving advices -> Uncaught TypeError: Property 'children' of object #<HTMLDivElement> is not a function
[15:19:36] <Velveeta> i assumed clickedSlide was a jquery object since you were showing it calling .html(), but apparently not, so do this: $(tSwiper.clickedSlide).children(':first').attr('src').split('/').slice(-1)
[15:21:27] <nafta> damn it man
[15:21:32] <nafta> how do you know all this stuff?
[15:21:37] <nafta> worked like a charm
[15:21:41] <nafta> thanks Velveeta
[15:21:45] <grafi> basics!
[15:21:46] <grafi> :D
[15:22:03] <nafta> yeah I spose
[15:22:16] <Velveeta> a lot of reading and a lot of doing and a lot of experimentation
[15:22:26] <Velveeta> i'm a firm proponent of mastering your craft ;)
[15:22:41] <grafi> lol
[15:22:42] <grafi> ^^
[15:24:00] <Velveeta> ok i'm out!
[15:24:05] <grafi> bye
[15:24:06] <nafta> thanks!
[15:24:09] <nafta> bye bye
[15:24:10] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[15:30:56] <nafta> grafi: does minifying a javascript files helps a lot on performance?
[15:31:17] <nafta> it is already 600 lines long
[15:31:19] <nafta> :'(
[15:34:37] <dlam> anyone know what the slider at http://www.bustle.com/ uses??
[15:41:43] <shoky> dlam: looks like it's a custom one
[15:42:50] <dlam> ooo what makes ya say that?   yeah when i google stuff in source i cant find anything relaly
[15:42:57] <dlam> seems like ember.js site or something
[15:43:35] <shoky> dlam: yes they're using ember.js. and i see in the code stuff like:  Bustle.CarouselItemCollectionView = Ember.CollectionView.extend(...
[15:43:41] <shoky> they're creating their own components
[15:44:07] <dlam> ah
[15:44:20] <dlam> thx thx
[15:44:28] <shoky> npnp
[16:16:58] <diphtherial> i'm creating a little widget for displaying 'calendar heatmaps', basically just monthly calendars where each date is colored according to how many entries are present in an array for that date
[16:16:59] <luigi69> Hello. I have a question - are there any disadvantages between doing .click() instead of .prop(checked, true) on an unchecked checkbox?
[16:17:35] <diphtherial> i'm wondering if it's infeasible to expect to store 17000 entries in a structure like this: {"1378405377": 1, "1378843734": 1, etc...}
[16:17:37] <luigi69> *.prop("checked", ...)
[16:17:38] <shoky> luigi69: yes.. .click() triggers a click event
[16:17:49] <diphtherial> (the key is the timestamp; the number is the number of elements that fall on that timestamp, usually 1)
[16:18:04] <luigi69> shoky - so if I want the click event, there is nothing wrong with choosing that method?
[16:18:24] <shoky> luigi69: if you want the click event, there is nothing wrong with triggering a click event
[16:18:25] <diphtherial> 17000 is just a ballpark figure, based on how many emails a colleague has in her inbox (that'll be plotted on this heatmap calendar thing)
[16:18:50] <luigi69> Thank you, shoky. I wanted to reasure that. Somehow had some doubts.
[16:20:33] <shoky> diphtherial: sounds fine to me
[16:27:34] <malibu> Hi there.  Has anyone ever seen a page behave differently when served by runserver as opposed to apache with wsgi_mod?  I'm talking about messed up positioning of divs.
[16:28:11] <malibu> I just took my source generated through runsever and pasted into a 'static' page through apache and it is messed up
[16:28:17] <malibu> But it looks fine through runserver
[16:28:32] <malibu> Even as I am typing this it sounds bizarre
[16:29:08] <malibu> Oops I should probably be on django
[16:38:03] <diphtherial> shoky: thanks for the vote of confidence :)
[16:38:26] <diphtherial> we'll see how it goes when i get down to it...i'm thinking of perhaps paging intervals of time in and out, but that's going to be annoying...
[16:53:28] <luigi69> Hm.. I want to trigger an click event on a element with jQuery, so that all event listeners would react besides one particular, that I defined. Any ideas? All I can think off is deregister the event listener before the trigger, then set it again - or pass custom data and check for it in the listener. Is there a cleaner way?
[16:54:06] <Pnoexz> hey.. how can i move all children of element #foo inside element #bar?
[16:54:29] <justin2> luigi69
[16:54:43] <luigi69> Pnoexz: http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[16:54:50] <justin2> luigi69 event namespaces?
[16:55:57] <Pnoexz> luigi69: thanks
[16:58:06] <luigi69> justin2 - interesting, that might be nice. I'll try this out right now.
[17:13:26] <krambiorix> hi, i want a html page with text, input boxes and select boxes to be converted to normal text... How can i do that?
[17:14:37] <luigi69> krambiorix - you want to take whole page contents or just a part of it?
[17:16:04] <luigi69> also is the page under your domain? Because there are security problems with corss-origin requests.
[17:16:32] <luigi69> justin2, anyone - http://jsfiddle.net/Em238/ - why is this happening?
[17:17:06] <shoky> luigi69: you didn't bind it with the namespace
[17:17:15] <shoky> using .on or .bind
[17:17:38] <luigi69> shoky - can I do something opposite - I would like to bind it to all events, besides one particualar
[17:17:41] <shoky> luigi69: also hmm
[17:18:00] <shoky> luigi69: i don't thhink you can trigger namespaced events
[17:18:15] <luigi69> I don't have to use a namespace.
[17:18:45] <krambiorix> luigi69, it's a div on a page i host
[17:18:53] <shoky> er sorry of course you can trigger namespaced events.
[17:18:59] <shoky> unless im totally confused
[17:19:32] <luigi69> It's just I'm triggering click event on a checkbox, and I have a change listener attached to that checkbox too. And I want that click event to propagate everywhere, besides this particular change listener, shoky.
[17:20:23] <shoky> luigi69: http://jsfiddle.net/Em238/1/
[17:21:41] <luigi69> krambiorix - you can grab contents of that page into a varibale with $.get(). Then use a selector on that contents to get to that div, then another one to .remove() all the inputs / selects.
[17:22:24] <krambiorix> luigi69, hmm, the jquery code is in that page
[17:25:22] <luigi69> Oh, sorry, krambiorix. You can use just .text() if you want just the contents. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[17:25:57] <luigi69> Or use the .html() and then filter it firing .remove() on subselections, if you want to get rid only of specific tags.
[17:26:20] <luigi69> also here is a way of stripping text of tags with a whitelist: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5601903/jquery-almost-equivalent-of-phps-strip-tags
[17:26:55] <luigi69> shoky - thank you
[17:27:14] <luigi69> but that doesn't solve my issue
[17:27:32] <luigi69> I want the handler to respond to click events the user makes
[17:27:40] <luigi69> just not the one triggered by me
[17:27:49] <luigi69> (by the js)
[17:28:53] <luigi69> I'm thinking of sending some data along in the event, and then checking for it and not reacting in the handler if the data is found. But this feels somehow dirty. I was wondering is there a better solution.
[17:29:34] <shoky> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/7K37h/
[17:30:07] <shoky> luigi69: that doesn't sound dirty to me.. sounds like a good solution
[17:30:53] <luigi69> shoky - i'm sending aditional data, just because I can't precisely define to which events the handler should respond and to which not.
[17:31:01] <shoky> luigi69: you can also bind all the other ones using a namespace, except this specific handler
[17:31:06] <shoky> and trigger the click with the namespace
[17:31:42] <luigi69> nah, I'm making a replacement of checkbox with a custom button
[17:32:09] <luigi69> I don't want the client code to know  is it dealing with origin input or the custom version.
[17:32:43] <luigi69> So I make two event handlers - one for the checkbox and one for replaement, to make sure they stay in sync.
[17:32:48] <shoky> you can make a custom event, also..
[17:33:20] <luigi69> My problem is that triggering click event, triggers my change listener and both things fire in that situation.
[17:33:39] <shoky> the dirty thing is that you're triggering a click event
[17:33:43] <luigi69> And stopping propagation would prevent client code to work.
[17:33:43] <shoky> that's dirty by definition
[17:33:47] <shoky> because there was no click.
[17:33:58] <luigi69> User clicked.
[17:34:01] <luigi69> Just not that one element.
[17:34:04] <shoky> if you want some function to execute, the right solution is to call it
[17:34:10] <luigi69> But it should behave like that one was clicked.
[17:34:20] <shoky> or to trigger a custom event that is listened for
[17:34:24] <luigi69> But I want to have a separation.
[17:34:35] <shoky> a custom event will give you separation
[17:34:38] <luigi69> Like I say the client code should not know that there was a substiute clicked.
[17:35:02] <shoky> not sure what you mean by client code
[17:35:13] <luigi69> Let's say you have forms on site with checkboxes.
[17:35:22] <luigi69> These forms have click listeners.
[17:35:28] <luigi69> For calculating things - for example.
[17:35:47] <luigi69> Now at some point you decide you wanna pretify the form, so you use the plugin I'm writing.
[17:36:00] <luigi69> It will create substitute buttons for these checkboxes.
[17:36:17] <luigi69> All those click listeners for calculating stuff shouldn't be changes.
[17:36:20] <luigi69> *changed
[17:36:29] <luigi69> They should respond normaly.
[17:37:04] <shoky> and which one shouldn't be triggered?
[17:37:12] <krambiorix> shoky, luigi69 thanks!
[17:37:19] <luigi69> My onechange event listner of this plugin
[17:37:31] <shoky> your own event listener, ok
[17:38:01] <luigi69> yes
[17:38:06] <shoky> i don't see how sending the data with the event matters. it's not like the client is going to be checking for your plugin's data
[17:39:14] <luigi69> Well I think I'll go for it, I don't wanna spend 5 hours fiddling around it. But it is somehow cirplled, that I'm sending aditional data object just because I cant be specific enought about what events my event listener should answer to.
[17:40:04] <shoky> lemme think of another way..
[17:40:41] <luigi69> I just wanted to say `hey, listen to all clicks, but not this one I trigger there up there`
[17:41:44] <luigi69> ups, redundant `there`... I've breaked the DRY rule even writing on IRC :(
[17:42:20] <luigi69> *broke (I think)
[17:42:22] <shoky> luigi69: if it works for you, you can also check for event.originalEvent === undefined in your handler
[17:42:38] <shoky> oh but you're on a change event, hm
[17:43:02] <luigi69> Besides that would also stop client code from triggering it, right.
[17:43:06] <shoky> not sure you could even send data..
[17:43:18] <shoky> (that could be seen in a change handler)
[17:43:32] <luigi69> Oh - I haven't thought about that!
[17:45:29] <luigi69> You know what, I'll take a different approach, shoky.
[17:45:44] <luigi69> All the change listeners does is it just toggles `checked` class.
[17:45:56] <luigi69> I'll check by myself should the class be added or removed.
[17:46:15] <luigi69> So if the event fires twice there is no harm.
[17:46:26] <luigi69> The class will be twice `added` or `removed` - same result.
[17:47:06] <luigi69> I don't thing that the listener will do anything more in the future. And if it will I'll worry then.
[17:52:36] <shoky> luigi69: oks. indeed you can't send data like that.. you could set data on the element though, with .data(...)
[17:53:05] <Velveeta> i missed the question, what's going on? who are you people?
[17:53:08] <shoky> luigi69: you can also just bind your change event with a namespace, and unbind it temporarily while you trigger the click
[17:53:10] <Velveeta> where am i?
[17:53:36] <shoky> space, yo
[17:53:54] <Velveeta> dear god… it's full of stars!
[17:54:08] <shoky> just don't put them all in a tube.
[17:54:17] <luigi69> shoky - yeah, I've mentioned this before - unbinding for the time of the trigger would work too.
[17:54:26] <luigi69> I guess.
[17:54:28] <Velveeta> well yeah, if you clog the tubes, the e-letters won't be able to get through
[17:55:07] <shoky> who clogged my intarwebz
[17:55:42] <shoky> luigi69: or, of course, a boolean flag. maybe you mentioned that too, i think
[17:59:44] <luigi69> shoky - I didn't think of the flag.
[18:00:17] <luigi69> I'll go with unbinding tho.
[18:36:20] <nafta> hrmm
[18:36:26] <nafta> this is fux0red up
[18:38:23] <nafta> I'm loosing functionality on a ajax generated button
[22:00:19] <raj> could someone show me the coding style in which this is done in a jquery plugin? `$('#selector').myPlugin({'some':'options for initialization'})`, and later I can do `$('#selector').myPlugin('doSomething')` to run some function in myPlugin. Collecting the object during initialization is no problem, but I'm wondering how the function should be executed according to the string passed
[22:01:23] <raj> are you shitting me? how is this place so vacant again
[22:01:30] <raj> no one has sent a message in hours!
[22:02:13] <LoneSoldier728> hey how do I add confirm in a jquery function
[22:02:16] <LoneSoldier728> submit function
[22:02:51] <raj> huh?
[22:02:59] <LoneSoldier728> aka $('.eleClass').submit(function(event) { var c = confirm('yes'); } )
[22:03:11] <LoneSoldier728> like that does not pop-up a confirm
[22:03:38] <LoneSoldier728> does that make sense raj?
[22:04:04] <angier1> you want like a div to pop with a confirm box?
[22:04:16] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/ET4wr/ <-- is it someway to find end of line in any match and add two spaces to it?
[22:04:41] <LoneSoldier728> yeah and basically if i hit cancel
[22:04:46] <LoneSoldier728> then for the submit button to not work
[22:04:55] <angier1> are you using jquery ui?
[22:05:20] <angier1> i think you need that for dialog windows
[22:05:25] <angier1> that or something like bootstrap
[22:05:35] <LoneSoldier728> ah i cant use it right in jquery?
[22:06:11] <angier1> i could be wrong but jquery by itself doesn't have poppable dialog windows
[22:06:38] <LoneSoldier728> ah ok
[22:06:40] <angier1> i could be misunderstanding you but
[22:06:45] <LoneSoldier728> maybe window.confirm might work?
[22:06:46] <angier1> if you want something liek this: http://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[22:07:21] <brucey> i have a webpage with autofocus on the search form field. I want to remove the focus when the user presses up or down arrow button. How do i do that?
[22:07:30] <LoneSoldier728> ya basically, so there is no way to do it in jquery otherwise
[22:07:45] <LoneSoldier728> only javascript has the confirm api call
[22:07:50] <LoneSoldier728> ?
[22:08:50] <angier1> oh i see you just want
[22:08:56] <angier1> the plain javascript confirm
[22:08:59] <LoneSoldier728> yeah
[22:09:21] <angier1> what's happening
[22:09:27] <angier1> can you console.log or alert
[22:09:33] <angier1> instead of confirm
[22:09:36] <angier1> is that working
[22:09:48] <oste> anyone have experience with create.js or jquery UI widgets in general?
[22:09:57] <oste> I am trying to modify these options https://github.com/bergie/create/blob/master/dist/create.js#L2245-L2251
[22:10:01] <LoneSoldier728> alert works
[22:10:27] <LoneSoldier728> confirm() does not show a pop up
[22:10:38] <oste> trouble is, that plugin gets instantiated here https://github.com/bergie/create/blob/master/dist/create.js#L401-L403
[22:10:55] <oste> so I just do jQuery('body').midgardCreate({});
[22:10:58] <angier1> can you open up your browser
[22:11:04] <angier1> and call confirm from the javascript console
[22:11:07] <oste> but how do I edit those toolbar options???
[22:11:31] <brucey> i have a webpage with autofocus on the search form field. I want to remove the focus when the user presses up or down arrow button. How do i do that?..Please help out
[22:12:41] <LoneSoldier728> yeah
[22:12:45] <LoneSoldier728> let me see might be calling it wrong
[22:13:02] <angier1> yeah i mean if alert works there
[22:13:09] <angier1> confirm should work there
[22:13:18] <angier1> maybe there's a browser setting that's not showing confirms or something
[22:13:30] <oste> brucey http://api.jquery.com/keypress/
[22:13:56] <LoneSoldier728> no because it works if i go to w3 schools
[22:14:01] <LoneSoldier728> let me see if i can get a fiddle up
[22:14:24] <oste> in the event you can use if ( event.which == 13 ) {
[22:14:25] <Whiskey> no one?
[22:14:40] <oste> just need to map your keys
[22:15:25] <oste> http://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/javascript-keycodes/
[22:16:06] <brucey> oste: thanks! i'll try that
[22:17:15] <LoneSoldier728> http://jsfiddle.net/6x6fS/
[22:17:23] <LoneSoldier728> wierd it is working here damn
[22:17:48] <angier1> yeah
[22:18:17] <LoneSoldier728> is it different for a .submit
[22:18:21] <LoneSoldier728> instead of a .click
[22:18:23] <LoneSoldier728> let me see
[22:18:39] <angier1> once it pops up once you can tell the browser not to pop up anymore, maybe you told it not to pop up anymore in that window
[22:19:41] <LoneSoldier728> but
[22:19:52] <LoneSoldier728> I am getting alert pop ups
[22:20:04] <LoneSoldier728> ah you are right
[22:20:09] <LoneSoldier728> how do i re-enable it
[22:20:17] <LoneSoldier728> ill just open a new tab
[22:20:47] <LoneSoldier728> nope how do i re-enable it... : /
[22:22:04] <LoneSoldier728> any clue? I am not sure how I did that
[22:22:27] <angier1> it's not working in a new tab?
[22:22:31] <LoneSoldier728> nope
[22:22:51] <angier1> if you open a new tab can you alert/confirm from the console?
[22:23:04] <angier1> try closing all windows or opening a new browser session
[22:23:09] <angier1> \i dont think it's a permanent option
[22:23:12] <LoneSoldier728> Can't alert or confirm on my localhost
[22:23:20] <LoneSoldier728> but it works
[22:23:23] <LoneSoldier728> on regular web pages
[22:23:34] <LoneSoldier728> so it is specific to my app running...
[22:23:38] <angier1> yeah
[22:23:45] <LoneSoldier728> and it was working like 5 min ago
[22:23:46] <angier1> if a page opens alerts
[22:23:51] <angier1> you get a chance to stop alerts for that page
[22:24:02] <LoneSoldier728> ah the prevent button right
[22:26:08] <angier1> what is the best time to be in this channel for active discussions?
[22:26:21] <angier1> first time here
[22:26:26] <LoneSoldier728> what kind of discussions are you looking for
[22:26:38] <LoneSoldier728> it just depends on you asking questions
[22:26:44] <angier1> more on the newbie side
[22:27:11] <angier1> i can't find a good answer on stackoverflow or anywhere else
[22:27:38] <angier1> about a few simple things
[22:27:48] <LoneSoldier728> ask
[22:28:10] <LoneSoldier728> people will answer, it always depends, IRC channels aren't that busy during the weekends
[22:28:21] <LoneSoldier728> weekdays, usually it ispacked during work hours
[22:28:25] <LoneSoldier728> or right after work hours
[22:28:29] <angier1> cool
[22:28:37] <angier1> well mainly tonight i'm trying to do tabs
[22:28:46] <angier1> on my main page
[22:28:57] <angier1> and i want to separate the tabs into separate html files
[22:29:10] <LoneSoldier728> so a nav bar
[22:29:18] <LoneSoldier728> with each one pointing to a diff page
[22:29:23] <angier1> yeah
[22:29:26] <LoneSoldier728> just wrap each one in separate a tags
[22:29:31] <angier1> but i don't understand what the default behavior should be
[22:29:33] <LoneSoldier728> no js needed
[22:29:39] <LoneSoldier728> just html tags
[22:29:57] <angier1> the html files themselves are going to be templates
[22:30:12] <angier1> eventually i'll be using backbone but for now i'm just using require
[22:30:15] <angier1> to load templates
[22:30:20] <LoneSoldier728> yeah I use backbone
[22:30:22] <angier1> and doing some minimal jquery stuff to them
[22:30:27] <LoneSoldier728> so you change the views
[22:30:46] <angier1> let me give a more concrete example
[22:30:47] <LoneSoldier728> and backbone uses a router to change the pages
[22:30:56] <angier1> you have your ul bar
[22:31:02] <angier1> and then you have divs under it
[22:31:11] <angier1> the one that is 'active' is the one that is shown
[22:31:13] <angier1> with bootstrap
[22:31:32] <angier1> but on the initial load i dont know how to get those divs in there
[22:31:38] <angier1> without just coping the tempaltes inside
[22:31:46] <angier1> i can have blank divs
[22:31:51] <angier1> and add the stuff later
[22:32:01] <LoneSoldier728> um
[22:32:12] <LoneSoldier728> I am confused, I am actually using bootstrap myself too
[22:32:19] <angier1> i can cut paste
[22:32:23] <angier1> i suck at explaing
[22:32:23] <LoneSoldier728> can you show me a jsfiddle with it
[22:32:33] <LoneSoldier728> do you know how to use jsfiddle?
[22:32:43] <angier1> sort of
[22:33:00] <angier1> let me give it a shot
[22:36:23] <angier1> ok this is a partial one
[22:36:25] <angier1> http://jsfiddle.net/XLU8r/1/
[22:36:33] <angier1> i didnt setup underscore
[22:36:41] <angier1> or try to have the external files themselves but
[22:36:47] <angier1> basically my question is
[22:37:00] <angier1> the html before the jquery on ready event
[22:37:13] <angier1> has hardcoded <divs> with ids etc.
[22:37:21] <LoneSoldier728> ok
[22:37:23] <angier1> when onready fires it renders the templates
[22:37:24] <LoneSoldier728> let me look
[22:38:32] <LoneSoldier728> it seems so complicated
[22:38:39] <LoneSoldier728> for just a nav bar
[22:39:02] <LoneSoldier728> if it is going to be the same on every page there is no point in even using backbone for it
[22:39:18] <LoneSoldier728> if you are trying to make it a single page application
[22:39:29] <LoneSoldier728> then I can understand and at that point you just go to the router
[22:39:47] <angier1> there will be other parts to it
[22:40:01] <Juank> Hello need some expert help please
[22:40:04] <angier1> i'm not using backbone now but i want to later just to give it better architecture
[22:40:04] <Juank> please
[22:40:20] <Juank> some curve animation
[22:40:30] <angier1> but basically yeah i mean in the fiddle my question is
[22:40:30] <Juank> can´t get it to work properly
[22:40:50] <angier1> I'm hardcoding <div> elements in the html
[22:40:55] <angier1> and then changing them later by html()
[22:41:06] <Juank> :)
[22:41:10] <LoneSoldier728> based on what the page route is then have a new view with the template rendered
[22:41:23] <Juank> please check http://www.nexos.org.pe
[22:41:24] <LoneSoldier728> and if they click one of the tabs have a tags that take it to the route
[22:41:33] <Juank> sorry it has sound, client wants it
[22:42:55] <angier1> sort of a related question but probably easier
[22:43:09] <angier1> how would you approach pre-populating a <select> box
[22:43:25] <angier1> you have to do it in the ready() function right
[22:43:34] <angier1> what's the html look like before the ready
[22:43:40] <angier1> just a <select> stub?
[22:43:46] <angier1> or do you add the whole element
[22:44:09] <Juank> PLease some help with a curve animation
[22:44:39] <LoneSoldier728> if you want to add options to a select box
[22:44:39] <Juank> actually it´s a bezier animation
[22:44:48] <LoneSoldier728> you either append it or you pre-add each option
[22:45:10] <Juank> Pre populate with server side
[22:45:30] <Juank> depends on your site of course
[22:45:39] <angier1> yeah I don't have a server side atm :)
[22:45:42] <Juank> you can use xml
[22:46:26] <LoneSoldier728> oh are you trying to populate it with data or something?
[22:46:34] <angier1> yeah
[22:46:39] <angier1> it's a music theory website
[22:46:44] <Juank> that was my thought
[22:46:50] <angier1> i want to prepopulate certain chords in select boxes
[22:46:53] <Juank> fake the select
[22:47:04] <LoneSoldier728> I thought he was being as basic as figuring out how to add options
[22:47:06] <angier1> right now i have the data in javascript / json
[22:47:14] <LoneSoldier728> so pull it out of json
[22:47:23] <LoneSoldier728> with a loop or forEach or each if using jquery
[22:47:29] <angier1> right that's how i'm doing it
[22:47:31] <Juank> yep
[22:47:32] <LoneSoldier728> and then for each one add the value to the option
[22:47:35] <angier1> but what shoudl the html look like
[22:47:50] <angier1> should I have the <select> element in the html at first
[22:47:53] <LoneSoldier728> <select> <option>
[22:48:01] <angier1> or add the element through javascript
[22:48:05] <LoneSoldier728> what is it a part of
[22:48:15] <LoneSoldier728> well if you are going to go through each element
[22:48:20] <LoneSoldier728> on jquery side or js
[22:48:35] <LoneSoldier728> then you have to create the options on that side and append it
[22:48:40] <LoneSoldier728> and the select is up to you
[22:48:47] <angier1> yeah
[22:48:48] <LoneSoldier728> you can just append them all to the select
[22:48:52] <LoneSoldier728> in the html
[22:48:58] <angier1> like i'm trying to think what the behavior would be
[22:49:03] <angier1> if user had javascript disabled
[22:49:04] <LoneSoldier728> which is prob your best bet
[22:49:10] <angier1> if they would have black select boxes
[22:49:18] <angier1> etc
[22:49:21] <Juank> or everything to a div
[22:49:51] <LoneSoldier728> ya i was going to say div but it sounds like he wants to keep as many elements in the html
[22:50:17] <LoneSoldier728> Juank, do you know why I cannot see alerts/confirms on my localhost
[22:50:36] <angier1> have you tried restarting the browser?
[22:50:41] <angier1> or opening a new browser window
[22:50:47] <angier1> not just a new tab
[22:50:52] <Juank> mmmm
[22:50:58] <Juank> everywhere
[22:51:00] <Juank> ?
[22:51:00] <LoneSoldier728> not sure why it is disabled, it is possible I said prevent, but when I go to a different site it works
[22:51:10] <angier1> it prevents based on the page
[22:51:14] <LoneSoldier728> or to the localhost options (using chrome)
[22:51:16] <angier1> if you go to a different site it wont prevent
[22:51:18] <Juank> have tried in different browsers?
[22:51:24] <LoneSoldier728> yeah angier1 I did reset it
[22:51:26] <Juank> have you*
[22:51:45] <angier1> that's really weird
[22:51:53] <LoneSoldier728> ah ya
[22:51:59] <LoneSoldier728> it does not work in other browsers either
[22:52:05] <LoneSoldier728> so I must have broken it in my code then
[22:52:34] <Juank> have you tried different sites?
[22:52:41] <Juank> I mean use firebug
[22:52:50] <LoneSoldier728> yeah I have other sites work
[22:52:55] <Juank> to check your script
[22:52:57] <LoneSoldier728> console.log prints with no error
[22:53:33] <Juank> can you post your site
[22:53:38] <Juank> to replicate it here
[22:53:39] <angier1> does your code call all of those submits
[22:53:47] <angier1> it coudl disable it automatically
[22:53:52] <angier1> say if you call it a bunch of times
[22:54:14] <angier1> all=alot
[22:54:24] <Juank> yeah but you see it the ifrst time
[22:54:43] <Juank> maybe your alert
[22:54:49] <Juank> is inside bad code
[22:54:50] <LoneSoldier728> I tried making a jsfiddle
[22:54:52] <LoneSoldier728> but it works on that
[22:54:56] <Juank> haha
[22:55:11] <Juank> are on XAMPP
[22:55:24] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/78Jb4/ <-- How can i make that second replace just applay to the row it did the first replace on?
[22:55:45] <Whiskey> and not do it on all rows
[22:55:55] <LoneSoldier728> :first ?
[22:56:39] <LoneSoldier728> Here let me make a jsfiddle with my current code maybe I am not seeing something
[22:56:43] <Whiskey> well yeh. but im going to do this on many many rows, diffrent replaces as that won´t work
[22:56:52] <Whiskey> on some way it need to be connected
[22:57:39] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/CDEtKW8k
[22:57:44] <LoneSoldier728> you notice anything
[22:57:49] <Juank> use a class
[22:57:54] <Juank> on the span
[22:58:40] <Whiskey> yeh thats also one way, but can´t jQuery just check its on current line?
[22:58:53] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/78Jb4/2/ <-- like that
[22:59:31] <LoneSoldier728> Juank you notice anything
[22:59:54] <Juank> haven´t seen the link
[23:00:04] <Juank> please send it again
[23:00:13] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/CDEtKW8k
[23:00:13] <Juank> ok now I see it
[23:00:47] <Whiskey> every new regexp is for a new span line, must be away to do it one by one
[23:02:34] <angier1> yeah lonesoldier i don't see anything there.  Try removing everything and just alerting once and seeing if that works
[23:02:54] <angier1> i mean if you can console.log inside those conditions then you should be able to alert
[23:03:01] <Juank> yeah alert in first line
[23:03:19] <Juank> true
[23:08:20] <Juank> can you paste the html?
[23:09:22] <Juank> LoneSoldier728 can you paste the html?
[23:12:50] <LoneSoldier728> sorry
[23:12:53] <LoneSoldier728> um
[23:15:56] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/uUYvsh3t
[23:15:57] <LoneSoldier728> there
[23:16:01] <LoneSoldier728> had to change it from jade
[23:18:11] <angier1> can you alert or confirm on the first line of the ready event?
[23:18:47] <angier1> above your first console.log, if you alert there and comment out the rest of the logic
[23:26:36] <Juank> checking
[23:26:54] <LoneSoldier728> ah gj
[23:26:55] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[23:27:00] <LoneSoldier728> it works
[23:27:07] <LoneSoldier728> so something must be broke in the function
[23:30:39] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/78Jb4/3/ <-- there it can remove the second whit alternator, but can you replace the text somewhy?
[23:30:53] <Whiskey> "someway"
[23:31:45] <Juank> LoneSoldier728 I think it is your your jquery link which doesn´t work for me
[23:31:55] <Juank> I used a local coy instead
[23:32:01] <Juank> copy*
[23:32:08] <Juank> and then it worked
[23:32:32] <Juank> this //ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js
[23:32:44] <Juank> doesnt work for me in localhost
[23:33:21] <Juank> but using a src="jquery-1.8.1.min.js"
[23:33:31] <Juank> it did
[23:36:00] <LoneSoldier728> hm
[23:36:08] <Juank> Can anyone help with a bezier animation please!!!!
[23:37:57] <Juank> LoneSoldier728 hm?
[23:39:35] <angier1> i wish i could help
[23:39:50] <angier1> have never studied animation
[23:40:01] <Juank> thanks anyway
[23:40:17] <Juank> http://nexos.org.pe/
[23:40:21] <Juank> please check it
[23:40:33] <Juank> the car anim is awful
[23:41:20] <LoneSoldier728> ya i dont know anything
[23:41:22] <Juank> sorry about the sound
[23:41:23] <LoneSoldier728> about animation
[23:41:25] <angier1> it's not so bad
[23:41:36] <LoneSoldier728> I am trying to see how i can test the jquery lol
[23:41:54] <Juank> look at the curve horrible
[23:42:00] <angier1> do you want basically a function
[23:42:06] <angier1> that makes it drive
[23:42:08] <angier1> smoother
[23:42:34] <Juank> mmm yes and it is driven by the scrollTop function
[23:42:47] <angier1> how does it drive now
[23:42:49] <Juank> thats the issue
[23:42:58] <Juank> like that
[23:43:03] <Juank> but the curve is not smooth
[23:43:08] <angier1> i mean you go from one point to another linearly
[23:43:17] <Juank> I only need smoothness
[23:44:33] <Juank> yes and as you scrroll the car should go really well through an invisble line
[23:45:52] <Juank> well thanks I`m goint to sleep good luck to everyone in your own projects
[23:46:00] <angier1> gn
[23:46:07] <Juank> gn
[23:46:12] <LoneSoldier728> thanks gn
