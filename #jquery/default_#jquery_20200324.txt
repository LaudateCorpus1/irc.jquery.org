[03:00:24] <adasr3> Hello All, I have div which contains 5 input text, I want check if all of them are blank, if so return true or else return false. I know I can do var blank = true $('.class').each(function(){blank &= $(this).val()==""}); any other way?
[03:02:05] <Cork> $('selector for input fields').filter(function() { return $(this).val() == '' }).length > 0
[03:02:44] <adasr3> cool thanks
[03:06:59] <adasr3> Cork actually, do you mean != ''
[03:07:08] <Cork> no
[03:07:20] <Cork> that will collect the input fields that are empty
[03:07:32] <Cork> the check later checks if the are any
[03:07:45] <Cork> so var blank = $('selector for input fields').filter(function() { return $(this).val() == '' }).length > 0;
[03:07:55] <Cork> and blank would be the same as before
[03:07:57] <adasr3> yea so lets say you have 20 fields and 1 of them not empty it will return 19 >0
[03:08:06] <adasr3> will be true
[03:08:09] <Cork> ya
[03:08:13] <adasr3> but should be false
[03:08:38] <Cork> ah, you want to check if there is any that is filled in
[03:08:50] <Cork> that's not what your code did before though :)
[03:09:01] <Cork> well for that i would invert the check ya
[03:09:28] <Cork> (it isn't a common thing to check though, normally it is checked that everything is filled in)
[03:09:40] <adasr3> var blank = true; $('.class').each(function(){blank &= $(this).val()==""});
[03:10:05] <adasr3> moment the first false comes in blank becomes false
[03:10:17] <adasr3> and false & true is false
[03:10:33] <adasr3> :) thanks for filter code
[03:10:35] <Cork> ya i know, i missed that you sat blank to true before you started
[03:10:50] <adasr3> I like the filter idea
[03:10:57] <adasr3> never used it before thanks for the code
[03:10:58] <adasr3> :)
[03:11:20] <Cork> it makes it a lot easier to read what your checking for
[03:25:36] <errorous> hello. Anyone using datatables? I'm passing the data that has more columns than defined in datatables. Before I did some code changes, that used to, when I export to xlsx , put all the columns in the output excel file. Now, after code changes, it doesn't, it only puts those visible ones
[03:25:50] <errorous> does anyone know how could I have done this?
[03:25:59] <errorous> ie, what did I change
[03:26:34] <errorous> can't really recall, nor can do some simple testing, as I changed way to much code to remember
[03:27:02] <errorous> but I think it worked up to a point where I had dom property defined - but absolutely not sure about that
[03:28:51] <adasr3> what do you use to query
[03:35:38] <errorous> adasr3 sorry?
[03:36:13] <errorous> I get the data via ajax, and form the datatable in question in success of that ajax call
[03:55:29] <errorous> Hello, did anyone reply while I was gone?
[04:56:12] <adasr3> errorous still here
[04:56:24] <errorous> adasr3 yes
[04:57:01] <adasr3> jsfindler post your javascript code, and share here. And check the ajax return data too
[04:57:16] <adasr3> view source if you checking in browser
[04:57:42] <errorous> adasr3 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60827284/datatables-export-all-columns-in-data-regardless-of-whats-visible-in-the-tab
[05:17:00] <errorous> adasr3 do you know of a way, when I define columns, to make some invisible?
[05:18:28] <adasr3> where
[05:18:30] <adasr3> in sql?
[05:18:45] <adasr3> just don't select them
[05:18:53] <errorous> adasr3 hmm, no, when I define columns: parameter for datatables
[05:19:06] <adasr3> you can just don
[05:19:07] <adasr3> t
[05:19:12] <adasr3> return on ajax
[05:20:22] <errorous> adasr3 http://dpaste.com/2NVRDT9#line-10
[05:20:29] <errorous> so, that doesn't work
[05:20:48] <errorous> adasr3 but as I said, I need them to be in the table so that they would appear in css
[05:20:58] <errorous> sorry, in xslx
[05:28:34] <adasr3> no clue sorry
[05:28:40] <adasr3> maybe ask in programming
[05:44:55] <kirua__> hi
[05:44:56] <kirua__> can you help me with this : https://jsfiddle.net/0gfq1346/  i want, to display table on click (and hide it) i dont know how to iterate over variable with jquery
[05:55:58] <errorous> kirua a few issues here. first, if you're using document.ready, wrap the whole code within it, not just itteration
[05:56:14] <kirua> can i not use it in this case ?
[05:56:27] <kirua> i just added it because i thought i couldnt bind the eventlistener without it
[05:56:44] <errorous> also, what exactly you want to do?
[05:57:53] <errorous> kirua also, if you want only hide, that's ok. but if you want show/hide depending on visibility, use toggle()
[05:58:08] <kirua> i want to do something like this : http://jsfiddle.net/yashhy/NtVyj/1/ but in a cleaner way and using jquery
[05:59:12] <errorous> also, you can just use click()
[06:01:46] <errorous> also, in your fiddle, you set it to pure js. make it use jquery
[06:24:28] <jajaja> anybody know about the tablesorter this one? https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter
[06:25:11] <jajaja> specificly the problem is that it doesn't sort integer columns correctly
[07:12:55] <kirua> errorous, can you please check why the jquery is not working ? it seems like it's missing a bracket or something : https://jsfiddle.net/1af29su8/
[07:19:06] <kirua> he left :s
[07:26:25] <errorous> Hello. Can someone help with this? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60827284/datatables-export-all-columns-in-data-regardless-of-whats-visible-in-the-tab
[07:49:45] <kirua> why this doesnt work :
[07:49:45] <kirua>         for (var i = 1; i<3; i++) {
[07:49:45] <kirua>             $('#sp'+i).click(function()
[07:49:59] <kirua> while $('#sp1') works
[07:55:49] <Cork> kirua: it most likely does, except all those elements has to exist before you loop
[07:55:59] <Cork> kirua: also you normally never want to do it like that
[07:56:17] <Cork> bind the event handler to a static parent and delegate the event instead
[07:56:35] <Cork> then you can handle all those elements with just one handler
[08:14:51] <kirua> Cork, do you have an example so i can insipe myself from it ?
[08:15:11] <kirua> inspire*
[08:15:33] <Cork> kirua: https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[08:15:38] <kirua> thx
[08:58:29] <mescalinum> how do I query for an element in a different document? $(win.document).$('.selector')? (doesn't work)
[09:01:54] <Cork> $('selector', document-you-want-to-work-on)
[09:01:59] <Cork> or $(doc).find()
[09:02:18] <Cork> the first version is a wrapper for the second
[09:02:31] <mescalinum> great, thanks Cork
[09:19:03] <mescalinum> Cork: is it required to pass the document also to queries inside the handler? e.g.: $('a', win.document).on('...', function() { ... $('selector', win.document).css(...); }); or can I omit the document parameter in the inner query?
[09:19:37] <Cork> mescalinum: jquery binds to the pages document when you load it
[09:19:53] <Cork> so you don't have to give it when you do $('') selectors
[09:20:09] <Cork> but if the document your selecting in is not that document you will have to give it
[23:14:06] <adasr3> Hello All, Let's Say I have a form, and text field in it, the text field has own ajax button for search. When text field is active, and user clicks enter I want the search be activated instead of form submition
[23:14:42] <adasr3> what is less hackie way doing it
[23:14:45] <robertmaxrees> bind a listener for the form's submit event, run the preventDefault method on the event object, and do the ajax.
[23:15:06] <adasr3> is there any way to do the field level instead of the form
[23:15:11] <robertmaxrees> no.
[23:15:18] <robertmaxrees> do it at the form level.
[23:15:21] <robertmaxrees> all of it :)
[23:15:35] <adasr3> this what I am already doing it, I don't like if statements inside
[23:15:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[23:16:40] <robertmaxrees> you don't need "if statements inside" - you just need a submit handler.
[23:17:24] <adasr3> what do you mean?
[23:17:37] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean by "I don't like if statements inside"?
[23:18:28] <adasr3> <form><input type="text" name="cool_field"><a id="search">Search</a> â€¦other fields</form>
[23:18:35] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[23:18:44] <robertmaxrees> 'cause otherwise I'm playing guessing games :)
[23:18:55] <adasr3> when someone clicks on cool_field I add active flag
[23:18:57] <robertmaxrees> your original problem statement was that you have a form with a text field and a submit button.
[23:19:08] <robertmaxrees> now you're changing the problem statement :)
[23:19:09] <adasr3> and on form if active flag is there I do search, otherwise submit
[23:19:28] <robertmaxrees> then you have two forms :)
[23:19:29] <adasr3> "Hello All, Let's Say I have a form, and text field in it, the text field has own ajax button for search"
[23:19:37] <adasr3> I don't want to forms :)
[23:19:45] <robertmaxrees> then bummer :)
[23:19:53] <robertmaxrees> if statements it is!
[23:21:42] <adasr3> I guess will do keypress listener and move the code there
[23:21:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[23:21:58] <adasr3> but I don't like it either
[23:22:00] <robertmaxrees> "what is less hackie way doing it"
[23:22:08] <adasr3> form is hackie too
[23:22:11] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[23:22:16] <robertmaxrees> you have two discrete forms :)
[23:22:29] <robertmaxrees> but hey, why listen to the person you're asking advice from?
[23:22:34] <adasr3> if I have two forms, I need to make copy of the field
[23:22:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[23:22:48] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to "copy" anything.
[23:22:56] <adasr3> how can you have form inside of the form?
[23:23:03] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[23:23:07] <robertmaxrees> you have two discrete forms.
[23:23:16] <robertmaxrees> just like i a sec ago.
[23:23:29] <adasr3> cool thanks for your opinion
[23:23:29] <robertmaxrees> *i said a sec ago
[23:23:32] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[23:23:36] <robertmaxrees> i give up on this channel.
[23:23:56] <adasr3> :) check out the ##truth
[23:24:01] <robertmaxrees> people come in, ask for input and advice, argue, get dismissing and rude.,
[23:24:03] <robertmaxrees> over it.
[23:24:06] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[23:24:21] <adasr3> was I rude?
