[04:11:15] <gavan> hi.. i've got something really weird going on with jQuery.animate(props,speed,easing,callback) - specifically the callback and the argument passed from jQuery to the callback.. if i run jQuery out of the box, i get an 'undefined' as argument. but if i change the jQuery source (3.6.0, line 7737 of the development source file) to use opt.old(this) instead of opt.old.call(this), then it all works.
[04:11:24] <gavan> i was wondering if you're aware of this issue.
[04:14:26] <gavan> it does this in both chrome and firefox

[23:54:36] <hdalang> Hello guys. I wanna reduce my code in here. I'm not sure the best way: https://jsfiddle.net/hdalang/fuamvbes/
[23:54:40] <hdalang> Any hint?
[23:56:09] <robertmaxrees> give the anchors a data attribute for the tab they should "activate".
[23:56:31] <robertmaxrees> then read that instead.
[23:57:57] <robertmaxrees> also get that $(".content").css("display","block"); into the css file instead :)
