[07:11:38] <RedFox> hi, a question, how I can chage the status of a checkbox, if his name is id="test[1]" ?
[07:21:04] <Cork> RedFox: $('#test\[1\]').prop('checked', true/false);
[07:21:59] <Cork> or gah forgot the string escape
[07:22:08] <Cork> $('#test\\[1\\]').prop('checked', true/false)
[07:22:42] <Cork> RedFox: it is the same escape rules used for css
[07:23:11] <Cork> (tough i would recommend against using that in ids, it makes selectors a lot harder to read)
[07:29:32] <RedFox> Cork: I tried:
[07:29:33] <RedFox> https://jsfiddle.net/dxpny2q6/
[07:34:54] <Cork> RedFox: you forgot the script
[07:36:00] <RedFox> no there is:
[07:36:01] <RedFox> https://jsfiddle.net/9t78hL2k/2/
[07:36:18] <RedFox> I put only the part that change the checkboxes
[07:36:44] <Cork> RedFox: the problem isn't the id, you have no value
[07:37:54] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/hkz9fgty/1/
[07:38:46] <RedFox> Cork Thank you ... so stupid error ...
[07:39:02] <Cork> RedFox: the other mistake with the fiddle was that you didn't load jquery
[07:39:38] <Cork> also note that if you load that script on your page you might need to wrap it in $(function() {}) depending on where you load it
[07:40:36] <RedFox> I see ... in my page i was loading, in fiddle i didn't see it. thak you again
[07:42:03] <Cork> np
[08:23:47] <goddard> can i match a partial id using find or closest?
[08:47:51] <pavonia> goddard: You can use attribute seelctors, e.g. [id*="foo"]
[08:48:41] <goddard> pavonia the id is numbered so id="group-1"
[08:48:51] <goddard> but i know the parent tr
[08:49:05] <goddard> i want to find the closest "#group-"
[08:49:17] <goddard> but dont know if it is #group-1 or 2 etc..
[08:49:52] <pavonia> Then [id^=group]
[08:55:35] <goddard> pavonia awesome thanks
[15:15:11] <goddard> when you splice an array does it re-order the keys?
[15:22:37] <robertmaxrees> the array that gets returned has the index/indices removed, so any remaining objects will be moved.
[15:26:48] <robertmaxrees> goddard what behavor are you seeing specifically?
[15:27:20] <robertmaxrees> *behavior
