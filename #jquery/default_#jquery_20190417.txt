[01:52:08] <ir7466> if i want to remove a particular class from EVERY element, what jquery should I use?
[01:52:21] <ir7466> $('???').removeClass('highlighting');
[01:52:22] <robertmaxrees> erm
[01:52:25] <ir7466> what should the ??? be?
[01:52:32] <robertmaxrees> you want to select everything?
[01:52:36] <ir7466> yeah
[01:52:42] <ir7466> i tried $('body > *')
[01:52:45] <ir7466> but that didn't work
[01:52:46] <robertmaxrees> you sure you can't whittle it down at all?
[01:52:54] <ir7466> nah, it has to be everywhere
[01:53:00] <robertmaxrees> because $('*') will select everything
[01:53:04] <ir7466> ok
[01:53:18] <ir7466> thanks
[01:53:32] <Cork> if you want to remove a specific class from every element just do $('.highlighting').removeClass('highlighting');
[01:53:33] <robertmaxrees> $('body > *') will only select children of body
[01:53:41] <Cork> no reason to select everything if you just want one class
[01:53:43] <robertmaxrees> oooh even better.
[01:53:49] <robertmaxrees> Cork++++++
[01:53:51] <ir7466> ahh
[01:53:53] <robertmaxrees> totally spaced on that.
[01:53:53] <ir7466> clever
[01:53:56] <ir7466> thank you
[03:58:10] <DJDan> after doing a $.get ajax request... how do i find out what files comes back? and also the content of one of the files that comes up
[04:07:41] <pavonia> Files? The success handler gets a data object passed which contains the data send by the server
[04:14:45] <DJDan> pavonia: when i goto blah.htm it comes back with a few cgi files... i am trying to get those files
[04:17:29] <kevireilly_> Normally you request blah.com/blah.htm and just get the text/html content returned by the server. What you may be observing is JavaScript on the that page which is running and making additional requests against a server for data or some such.
[04:18:56] <pavonia> Aren't .cgi files server-side? You normally shouldn't see them from a client
[04:19:58] <pavonia> Or perhaps you talking about a directory listing in HTML format?
[04:20:06] <DJDan> pavonia: usually.. except u can see cgi?2&2 etc.... as it outputs response....
[04:20:12] <kevireilly_> The Network tab of developer tools can help you tell the difference (e.g. select the XHR filter for network requests originating from JS). You can even right mouse click an XHR request and “Copy as fetch” to get a JS snippet to make the same request (Chrome developer tools)
[04:21:41] <kevireilly_> Note this will inherently not include Cookies that were previously set by a server response and, generally speaking, making requests across origins (CORS) are not going to work on your page versus the source page since your domain essentially has to be allowed to request said resource.
[04:24:12] <DJDan> i was trying to do a post requet to a cgi script... after a wget to the page... but it came up with a error...i think i need to pass a tokenid
[04:24:15] <DJDan> (its a router)
[04:24:27] <DJDan> after a ajax get*
[04:25:30] <kevireilly_> yeah, probably a couple authentication based things are established well before the point you’re evaluating. Speaking broadly, but cookies are probably part of the paradigm and tokens tend to expire.
[04:26:21] <DJDan> yeah, how do i get the actual token from the dom
[04:26:51] <DJDan> i do a ajax get to a htm, it then should return TokenID
[04:27:20] <kevireilly_> mmm there is more to it than that. In the Network tab, click the request in question and have a look at the Request Headers
[04:27:51] <DJDan> basically i do a get page blah.htm?_=tokenid  .... but then try post cgi?2&2 ... and it wont work.. it says error
[04:28:02] <kevireilly_> perhaps most of it is passed as part of the POST body, dunno, lots of varying implementations
[04:28:29] <DJDan> kevireilly_:  request header.. does a get.... with a tokenID, Useragent, and a cookie JESESSIONID
[04:29:16] <kevireilly_> then I suppose you’d need to determine what request provides the tokenID and sets the JESESSIONID
[04:29:28] <kevireilly_> *request/response cycle
[04:30:56] <DJDan> well i get the page a.htm?_=tokennumber ... but the actual TokenID seem to be different... and same with the Cookie: JSESSIONID
[04:32:53] <kevireilly_> this is a difficult thing in general, but even more difficult to remotely speculate on. I’d start by clearing cookies/sessions, setting network requests to “Preserve log”, login, and evaluate all the transactions very carefully because you’d need to replicate it to make something that works more than for a short period (e.g. session or token expiration is commonly inevitable)
[04:34:01] <kevireilly_> even then, it may not be possible or trivial, and you might actually be better served by using a headless browser like phantomjs, cheeriojs, or otherwise
[04:36:26] <DJDan> if i send a http get request... how do i get the TokenID from that.. will it be in the ajax response?
[04:38:46] <kevireilly_> evaluate the normal get request and look at the Response Headers and Response
[04:39:25] <kevireilly_> but generally speaking, data is returned by either the response returned by the server or the headers of said response
[05:04:52] <DJDan> not sure where it gets the 'requestheader... cookie: JSESSIONID= from
[05:05:03] <DJDan> and the TokenID
[05:05:26] <DJDan> xmlhttp.getAllResponseHeaders();  doesnt return anything usefull
[05:06:26] <DJDan> would the TokenID be in the dom?
[05:07:14] <Cork> DJDan: i would recommend using the network tab in developer tools and check what you get from the server there
[05:07:31] <DJDan> Cork:  im checking that
[05:07:48] <Cork> and ify ou don't find TokenID in there at all then you prob haven't made a successfull login
[05:07:56] <DJDan> The 'Request Header' says Cookie: JSESSIONID= and also a TokenID
[05:08:09] <DJDan> but im not sure how to get these values
[05:08:33] <Cork> that would be the cookie header
[05:09:02] <Cork> the value in it is just a string so you would have to split it yourself
[05:11:14] <DJDan> and how would i get it from the cookie header
[05:12:18] <Cork> getResponseHeader('Cookie')
[05:12:23] <Cork> would give you the string
[05:13:33] <DJDan> xmlhttp.getResponseHeader("Cookie");   didnt seem to get anything
[05:13:37] <DJDan> hmm
[05:13:47] <kevireilly_> it was probably set previously as part of some other request/response cycle such as logging in
[05:14:13] <Cork> you have to check the correct request ya
[05:14:18] <kevireilly_> servers return a response header to set a cookie which is transparently passed with all requests in the future
[05:14:32] <Cork> you could also check document.cookie
[05:14:43] <Cork> if it is the page load it could hold the cookie
[05:15:46] <DJDan> nup no document.cookie damn
[05:17:44] <kevireilly_> if chrome, click the area to the left of the URL and select Cookies to see previously set cookies per domain. To revise my previous statement, previously set cookies are transparently passed with all future requests to the same domain
[05:18:21] <Cork> depending on the cookie settings of the browser
[05:18:30] <Cork> if thirdparty cookies are blocked that might not at all be true
[05:18:46] <kevireilly_> fair point
[05:19:35] <Cork> and also worth mentioning, most browsers block third party cookies unless that domain has gotten cookies from a first party visit
[05:21:02] <DJDan> i think i need to use xhRFields withCredentials: true
[05:25:02] <kevireilly_> mmm guessing you need to make the request that produces a response that sets the cookie appropriately. The server likely needs to know about who you are (e.g. session for a logged in user) and cookies are commonly used to persist that context
[05:28:44] <DJDan_> lol. opps i by mistake did reboot instead of logout.. since they boot the option next to eachother
[05:30:36] <DJDan_> surely theres a way in the dom, or when i get a page once logged in to get the TokenID
[05:31:00] <DJDan_> theres a dom called token but it seems to be different to the cookie things
[05:31:10] <DJDan_> and only used when u do ?_=token
[05:31:19] <DJDan_> as part of the page request
[06:39:36] <DJDan_> do i need to set Refer Policy: "no-referrer-when-downgrade"  or does it do that by default?
[06:41:48] <DJDan_> neither 'TokenID' or 'Cookie' are retrievable via xmlhttp.getResponseHeader
[07:04:45] <DJDan_> Cork: any ideas?
[07:18:57] <paule32_> hello
[07:20:19] <paule32_> i have problem with ui-widget-content: i have 3 div's as content <img src 3 pictures, all 3 pictures are shown, and the div class is ui-widget-content
[07:20:32] <paule32_> i make these 3 div's #draggable
[07:20:53] <paule32_> they can be moved around the screen
[07:22:14] <paule32_> but, when i mouse click, the 3 items, each underlaying items (div's) automatically change the its position
[07:22:22] <paule32_> can this be override?
[07:31:48] <Cork> DJDan_: might be the cookie is network only, donno
[07:32:34] <Cork> paule32_: the class doesn't matter, jquery don't use them for anything other then styling
[07:34:24] <DJDan_> my accessing the webpage via my external ip
[07:34:35] <Cork> paule32_: the problem is prob the configuration for the draggable call
[07:34:47] <DJDan_> im accesing*
[07:35:14] <DJDan_> Cork:  how do i get the XHR for the login before it redirects the login page
[07:35:28] <Cork> DJDan_: what you need to send to get it working depends on the server. i have no cluse what is needed there
[07:35:40] <Cork> DJDan_: you can't avoid redirects with xhr
[07:35:56] <Cork> the browser processes it before giving the result to the site
[07:36:07] <DJDan_> iwas trying to find out what script it uses for login
[07:36:10] <DJDan_> but it quickly disappears
[07:36:47] <Cork> DJDan_: the correct solution might be to do a full page login on the page and then go to ajax calls after that
[07:37:02] <Cork> also if the site isn't built to be used by third party, you most likely can't
[07:37:47] <DJDan_> thats what im trying to do now... login via browser, then issue ajax commands.. im just trying to pull the cookie
[07:38:09] <DJDan_> cause theres a TokenID and Cookie parameter
[07:38:25] <DJDan_> which is different to the tokenin in the dom that uses for http requests
[07:38:29] <DJDan_> tokenid
[07:38:32] <Cork> ya, but it might not be meant to be used directly in javascript
[07:38:47] <Cork> many apis are meant to be proxied on the users own server
[07:39:02] <Cork> (talking generically of cource)
[07:39:14] <DJDan_> weither i use a browser, or pretend to be a browser it really is the same thing
[07:39:28] <DJDan_> as long as your sending the same info
[07:39:30] <Cork> ya, but doing ajax calls in a webpage isn't
[07:39:42] <DJDan_> so i should be using wget/curl commands instead
[07:39:53] <Cork> or a server script, ya possibly
[07:40:05] <Cork> cause cors isn't a thing for none ajax calls
[07:40:19] <Cork> it is the browser protecting servers from webpages scripts
[07:40:26] <DJDan_> is using python scrapy the same flexibility as using wget/curl commands
[07:40:46] <Cork> donno haven't used scrapy, but possibly
[07:41:04] <DJDan_> im trying to workout how to autologin first to the website..
[07:41:18] <DJDan_> but when i click ok.. it quicklyshows then vanishes the request
[07:42:12] <Cork> most likely cause the server sends a Location header
[07:42:42] <DJDan_> yeah... and if i hit 'record' it doesnt seem to work properly
[07:42:59] <Cork> there is a checkbox for persistance in the network tab
[07:43:10] <Cork> click it and you won't lose the old requests
[07:43:19] <Cork> it is most likely what you are looking for
[07:43:27] <paule32_> Cork: http://dpaste.com/3WTS76T
[07:43:37] <paule32_> that is all, what i have
[07:43:54] <DJDan_> Cork: where in chrome is that... im in the 'network' tab...
[07:44:07] <DJDan_> i did tick 'perserve log' but it removed i think
[07:44:23] <Cork> paule32_: have a look here http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable
[07:44:29] <Cork> and i THINK what you're looking for is http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-handle
[07:44:31] <Cork> but ya...
[07:44:40] <paule32_> ok, thx
[07:45:36] <Cork> DJDan_: preserve logs is what you're looking for ya (apparently changed name since last i used it)
[07:45:53] <DJDan_> yeah but it vanished.. how do i find the previous entry
[07:46:11] <Cork> you can't unless you get them to stick around
[07:46:23] <DJDan_> oh there found it
[07:46:26] <Cork> by default old entries gets purged when you do full page navigation to a new page
[07:47:51] <DJDan_> damn. everytime i relog in.. it does login?Username  and a long string.. and its different each time
[07:53:00] <DJDan_> Cork:  if i do a wget directly to the login, how do i get 'token' from the dom? since im not using a browser
[07:53:24] <DJDan_> cause all commands need a dom token... eg.... help?_=1294819248
[07:53:32] <Cork> DJDan_: 1. wget doesn't do parsing so it has no dom
[07:53:58] <Cork> 2. it most likely is a Location header from the loging post
[07:54:34] <Cork> also ?_= is almost always a cache avoid value
[07:54:39] <Cork> it has no server side meaning at all
[07:55:14] <paule32_> Cork: all dragable elements under the moveing element change position to top
[07:55:35] <paule32_> except the actual move drag element
[07:55:47] <Cork> paule32_: most likely cause the click bubbles or something
[07:56:25] <paule32_> click bubbles?
[07:57:23] <paule32_> imageine (from top col, to down col) d1 -> d2 ->d3
[07:57:50] <paule32_> now, when d1 is clicked and move,   <- d2 <-d3
[07:58:48] <paule32_> the except result should be an empty region
[08:02:20] <Cork> paule32_: try reproducing the problem in a jsfiddle
[08:03:41] <kber> Hi there, what’s the best way to uriEncode every single value within a nested javascript object? Something like looping through the object, but I can’t figure out exactly how I can do this
[08:04:31] <Cork> kber: you want to convert it to a url parameneter or just make sure values are safe to use in urls?
[08:05:10] <PCatinean> If I do $('#form-id :input') how do I do the same with var x = $('form-id'); ?
[08:05:13] <DJDan_> Cork: oh its doing some sort of RSA Encryption on the text field via a encrypt .js everytime...weird sttuff
[08:05:25] <Cork> kber: cause if you "just" want to convert it to parameters there is $.param
[08:05:41] <Cork> else you need to use a recursive object traveling
[08:05:53] <Cork> PCatinean: .find()
[08:06:32] <DJDan_> Cork:  https://pastebin.com/aUR0Gqei everytime it does a post it encrypts the text and password field differently... so i cant automate the login
[08:07:06] <kber> Cork: I want to convert it to a base64 string after that, which can cause problems when the value contains a special character. I want to use an uriEncode (or equavalent) so the base64 string doesn’t end in an invalid string.
[08:08:03] <Cork> kber: you want encodeURIComponent or encodeURI (check on mdn to choose the one matching what you want)
[08:08:27] <Cork> kber: then you have to traverse each key in each object and depending on if the value is another object traverse into that object
[08:09:15] <Cork> and that is simplest done by a recursive function
[08:09:47] <Cork> DJDan_: that looks like one of the standard libs for rsa js implementation (and old one not using webCrypto)
[08:09:54] <Cork> so, not THAT strange
[08:10:01] <kber> Currently I’m using encodeURIComponent. $.param looks interesting, I’ll take a look further into that. Thanks a lot.
[08:10:37] <DJDan_> Cork:  well it is a tp-link router.. im just trying to workout how to create a login script, but it keeps changing the user and password string
[08:11:18] <Cork> DJDan_: with how much routers has been hacked by emdeded images and the like, it doesn't surprice me
[08:12:16] <PCatinean> Cork, and if I attach to that .change() inside the callback if I use the initial variable will I have the latest changes?
[08:12:17] <dhecar> Hello, how can I rerender one widget when I click a button but without scrolling to top¿?
[08:12:28] <DJDan_> other then the user/pass whats it basing the randomness on.. time?
[08:12:39] <Cork> PCatinean: not sure what you mean
[08:12:55] <Cork> PCatinean: queries reference dom element, it doesn't fork them
[08:13:24] <Cork> dhecar: are you using a <a> tag?
[08:13:38] <Cork> or what is "a button"
[08:13:57] <dhecar> Cork: button
[08:14:05] <Cork> dhecar: type?
[08:14:55] <dhecar> no type in button,
[08:15:03] <Cork> set type="button" then
[08:15:08] <Cork> it most likely will help
[08:15:16] <Cork> default is type="submit"
[08:16:13] <dhecar> i'll try
[08:16:38] <Cork> DJDan_: time and a seed
[08:16:43] <Cork> like most crypto
[08:17:14] <DJDan_> so how do i generate that
[08:17:32] <Cork> you most likely will need to be able to do rsa encryption
[08:17:40] <Cork> with there private key
[08:17:58] <Cork> (or there public key, depending on it is private or public key encryption)
[08:18:09] <PCatinean> Cork, so every time I do form_var.find smth it's a reference to the actual dom in the state it is when called
[08:18:44] <DJDan_> Cork: and the rsa encryption key is that in that js file
[08:18:50] <dhecar> Cork: Don't work, when I click the button it rerender the widget but do the scroll to top again...
[08:18:51] <Cork> PCatinean: var x = $('#id'); x will reference the actual dom element that has that id, not a separate state of it
[08:19:00] <Cork> PCatinean: same with anything else that queries the dom
[08:19:24] <Cork> dhecar: then you most likely have some script on the page that does the scrolling
[08:19:47] <Cork> DJDan_: that is just the rsa functions, not the secrets
[08:20:09] * Cork checks again to make sure
[08:20:28] <DJDan_> line 947
[08:21:07] <Cork> ah, no it generates a new key every time
[08:21:14] <Cork> and line 947 is just des
[08:21:30] <Cork> what you care about is line 1208
[08:22:31] <DJDan_> so what function do i pass the user and pass to for it to generate
[08:22:51] <DJDan_> it does /cgi/login?Username=longstring
[08:22:58] <DJDan_> &Action=1&LoginStatus=0
[08:23:10] <Cork> haven't actually disected what the code actually does
[08:23:26] <Cork> uh... wait
[08:23:51] <Cork> des3... so it is a 8 character key encryption?? freaking vnc encryption? :D
[08:24:26] <DJDan_> meaning what
[08:24:27] <Cork> DJDan_: check the last object in there it is most likely what you care about
[08:24:34] <Cork> DJDan_: $.DES3.encrypt
[08:25:03] <Cork> with the caviat that i haven't done more then skimming the file
[08:25:29] <DJDan_> is this just a standard encryption method
[08:25:35] <Cork> ya
[08:25:37] <Cork> its des3
[08:25:52] <Cork> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES
[08:25:55] <DJDan_> so i can just call des3 from python or some other language directly and it will give back the same thing
[08:26:08] <Cork> ya
[08:26:33] <Cork> openssl has built in methods for it
[08:27:08] <DJDan_> oh hmmm
[08:27:23] <Cork> the rsa section most likely is just for securerandom
[08:28:27] <DJDan_> so is $.DES3.encrypt   putting both the username and password together
[08:28:35] <Cork> donno
[08:28:38] <Cork> its just "input"
[08:28:45] <Cork> what that is, i donno
[08:31:36] <paule32_> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/paule32/qjsdbLc6/10/
[08:31:45] <paule32_> something is missing
[08:32:09] <DJDan_> Cork:  i assume its something like.. var user=document.getElementById("pc-login-user").value;var pass=document.getElementById("pc-login-password").value;$.DES3.encrypt(user+pass)
[08:32:42] <Cork> paule32_: the html section should only contain what is normally body and resources to the left and scripts at the bottom
[08:33:09] <Cork> DJDan_: when reverse enginering, don't assume, disect
[08:33:55] <DJDan_> Cork: im not sure how
[08:34:15] <Cork> DJDan_: find the scripts in the browser, if you can't find all of it, find the outer most point somewhere
[08:34:18] <Cork> and put a breakpoint
[08:35:10] <paule32_> https://jsfiddle.net/paule32/qjsdbLc6/14/
[08:36:01] <Cork> paule32_: "enable" isn't a valid value to draggable
[08:36:42] <Cork> you can call it when it has been initialized, but not as the first call
[08:37:14] <Cork> and i see on raise effect at all when i do that change
[08:38:05] <Cork> paule32_: https://jsfiddle.net/odr25ku9/
[08:39:08] <paule32_> thx
[08:41:31] <DJDan_> Cork:  https://pastebin.com/mCcEB1aZ  line 2054&2055
[08:41:38] <DJDan_>         xmlHttpObj.open("POST", window.location.protocol + "//" + window.location.host + "/cgi/getTokenc", true);
[08:41:39] <DJDan_>         xmlHttpObj.setRequestHeader("TokenID", $.tokenid || 0);
[08:42:03] <Cork> line what?
[08:42:06] <Cork> 2054&2055 :D
[08:43:03] <Cork> DJDan_: it builds an url from the current url + /cgi/getTokenc
[08:43:39] <Cork> DJDan_: what you want to find is $.tokenid
[08:43:55] <DJDan_> Theres a token in the dom which is used for ?_=token... which is different from the TokenID that is passed on every request
[08:44:22] <Cork> DJDan_: like i said before ?_= is normally just a cache avoid value
[08:44:34] <Cork> and can normally just be ignored
[08:45:35] <DJDan_> so do i just do a post request and get the tokenid
[08:46:01] <DJDan_> to http://ip/cgi/getTokenc
[08:46:18] <Cork> DJDan_: it already has the tocken there
[08:46:26] <Cork> line 2055
[08:46:39] <Cork> what want to find is $.tokenid
[08:47:57] <Cork> finding where getToken is called (you have it as a function) is prob a good starting point
[08:48:15] <DJDan_> $.tokenid changes everytime i login
[08:48:24] <Cork> ya, but what is setting it
[08:48:34] <Cork> THAT and how it does it is what you want to find
[08:51:15] <DJDan_> Cork:  https://pastebin.com/PQKf5kMu  proxy.js line 45
[08:51:49] <Cork> DJDan_: that is just the starting value
[08:52:05] <Cork> or if you prever the inilitialize value
[08:53:03] <DJDan_> isnt it just getting the value from ip/cgi/getTokenc
[08:53:38] <Cork> then you would have to find where the result sets it, cause all you've showed me this far is setting the request value, not reading the response
[08:54:24] <DJDan_> what that be before or after i login
[08:54:53] <Cork> DJDan_: i don't have the code to tell you that; you will have to reverse enginer the code yourself
[08:59:53] <DJDan_> Cork:  im not entirely sure where... is line 2014 getToken what your after? https://pastebin.com/afK29zjA
[09:00:25] <Cork> DJDan_: i'm not after anything, i'm giving you hints what you need to look for
[09:00:42] <Cork> DJDan_: you need to find how it gets the tokenid value from the router
[09:00:52] <Cork> and currently you've only found where it uses it
[09:07:26] <DJDan_> Cork:  the answer is lib.js 2041.. https://pastebin.com/hrKM5rLK
[09:10:11] <DJDan_> not 100% sure how it works tho
[09:11:04] <Cork> DJDan_: that is token though, not tokenid
[09:12:08] <DJDan_> proxy.js has tokenid: token
[09:12:32] <Cork> that would mean something has to set a local variable token before that line runs for it to mean anything
[09:13:25] <Cork> so, ya you're stil missing something important
[09:17:13] <DJDan_> hey... the main index file.... <script type="text/javascript">var token=     lol.. it has the token when the page loads
[09:17:25] <Cork> there you go
[09:18:25] <Cork> DJDan_: but ya, it looks like a normal csrf tocken
[09:19:15] <Cork> (the server sets a uniq tocken to a page, the page uses it to signal that the page was actually loaded from the server when it posts back
[09:19:17] <Cork> )=
[09:19:22] <Cork> *)
[09:19:48] <DJDan_> hmm, so how would i encrypt the user/pass before page load to send.
[09:19:59] <DJDan_> to login
[09:20:13] <Cork> you would have to do there des3 encryption
[09:20:29] <Cork> and again find how it uses it
[09:57:19] <glowdemon1> https://hastebin.com/vodajeqila.js anyone see anything wrong with this?
[09:57:26] <glowdemon1> it wont even output 'click'
[09:57:44] <DJDan_> Cork:  getting there... found the nameand auth strings
[09:57:57] <thykka> glowdemon1, yes, there's stuff wrong with it
[09:58:17] <Cork> glowdemon1: puts console.log($('input.wpcf7-not-valid').length); before the comment
[09:58:37] <thykka> glowdemon1, namely, you're making the input a delegate listener, whose target is #contact-form. You'll likely want it the other way round
[09:58:50] <glowdemon1> oooo
[09:59:46] <AdamPDotty> no structure "input.wpcf7-not-valid #contact-form.wpcf7-not-valid" ?
[10:00:33] <Cork> AdamPDotty: what do you mean?
[10:00:56] <AdamPDotty> trying to make sense of glowdemons code but fail
[10:01:10] <Cork> AdamPDotty: the selector is inverted
[10:01:18] <AdamPDotty> delegate with a target by id can not be sensible
[10:01:35] <Cork> AdamPDotty: ya, cause the delegate is the target and the other way around
[10:01:35] <AdamPDotty> yep
[10:02:26] <Cork> didn't notice the removeClass first, makes it kinda obvious what the goal is
[10:02:40] <glowdemon1> Ya thanks
[10:03:01] <glowdemon1> I'm not even sure if I need it to be delegated
[10:03:32] <Cork> if you want a dynamic class to affect id the event fires, then ya
[10:03:43] <Cork> if it isn't dynamic, then prob not
[10:04:09] <glowdemon1> The class gets added dynamicly
[10:04:23] <glowdemon1> I know that I need to do this when dynamicly adding elements, but does it count too for dynamically adding classes?
[10:04:39] <Cork> then if it wasn't delegated, you would bind events based on what classes where there when the selector ran, and nothing after that
[10:04:58] <Cork> cause .on doesn't parse the normal selector, it just gets a list of elements
[10:05:06] <Cork> $() does the query and finding
[10:05:20] <glowdemon1> O I see
[10:05:59] <glowdemon1> so when I load my page, jquery uses $() to get a list of items with .wpcf-invalid - but there are none until I submit and validate the form
[10:06:08] <glowdemon1> So I do have do use delegated events
[10:06:13] <Cork> yup
[10:06:19] <glowdemon1> Ahh, great thanks!
[10:06:35] <Cork> alternatively you could check for the class in an event without the class in the selector
[10:06:40] <Cork> but a delegate works just as well
[10:06:53] <glowdemon1> Yeah, I assume its cleaner
[10:06:57] <Cork> ya
[10:07:26] <Cork> if($(this).hasClass('wpcf-invalid') { /* everything is here */ }
[10:07:35] <Cork> if you don't need the if why use it :)
[10:07:54] <glowdemon1> Exactly
[10:18:08] <loco> sup
[10:20:28] <makr8100> k bye
[11:09:40] <paule32_> hello
[11:10:22] <paule32_> i have this peace of code:  (function ($) {  ... })(jQuery);
[11:10:37] <paule32_> firefox give me error: jQuery not defined
[11:24:55] <pavonia> paule32_: Are you sure jQuery is included before this code is run?
[11:27:21] <thykka> (hint: it's not)
[11:30:25] <pavonia> lol
[12:05:44] <robertparkerx> is it possible to make an achor click event do nothing on the first click but second click it will go to its link?
[12:05:51] <robertparkerx> anchor
[12:06:19] <Taplar> sure, you could attach an one() event listener that ignores the click
[12:08:45] <robertparkerx> Taplar, like this? https://hastebin.com/osohuhewac.js
[12:09:14] <robertmaxrees> i'd rethink that ui fwiw.
[12:09:28] <robertmaxrees> why not expan on hover?
[12:09:28] <Taplar> one sec, ironically haste bin is being slow for me
[12:09:33] <robertmaxrees> *expand
[12:10:02] <Taplar> yeah, that's what I was referring to
[12:11:19] <robertparkerx> robertmaxrees, what do you mean? I'm trying to stop the first click event on mobile. There is a submenu attached on :hover but I tried changing it to :hover, :active and it works but still goes to the child links
[12:11:51] <robertparkerx> I trhought making them double click instead would work
[12:12:09] <robertparkerx> first click would show the submenu
[12:12:10] <robertmaxrees> that's gonna make for a confusing UI.  also using .one() will only work the first time.
[12:12:19] <robertmaxrees> also: how would they close the menu? :)
[12:12:30] <robertparkerx> good point
[12:12:56] <robertmaxrees> if it's for some kind of category, just add a "view all {category}" link to the bottom of the submenu.
[12:13:50] <robertparkerx> yea its bad. it works for one loop but the third time they click it goes to the link
[12:13:56] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:14:13] <robertmaxrees> plus it's not intuitive.  users will tap it a second time thinking it'll close the menu item
[12:18:01] <thykka> how about a button beside the menu, that expands it, instead of following the link?
[12:18:12] <thykka> i.e. [  menu item name  | V ]
[12:18:14] <robertmaxrees> still not intuitive to most end users.
[12:18:22] <thykka> can't win with menus
[12:18:28] <robertmaxrees> sure you can :)
[12:18:36] <thykka> highly doubtful
[12:18:44] <thykka> they're like the pie charts of the internet
[12:19:01] <robertmaxrees> you're right what would i know we only get a massive amount of traffic on our sites and have worked on exactly that problem a few times before ;)
[12:19:07] <thykka> all the management/marketing types love them, despite evidence of poor performance
[12:19:24] <robertmaxrees> highly dependent on the category you're in.
[12:19:28] <thykka> sure
[13:12:51] <elit3x_> i am passing a json response object "data" to  $.each(data, function (index, value) -- the order of the data is not maintained while itterating the json object... Any tips?
[13:13:26] <Taplar> object keys do not have a guarenteed order
[13:14:47] <elit3x_> Taplar, ok -- are you aware of a native function to sort?
[13:15:18] <elit3x_> the data is sorted when being sent from the ajax API call
[13:15:42] <Taplar> You can Object.keys(data).sort() to sort keys, otherwise if order is important, consider if an array would make more sense.
[13:17:12] <elit3x_> Taplar, the key is an "id", but i would like to sort on the 'name' value  --  are you saying loop the json response and convert it to an array?
[13:17:30] <Taplar> can you show me an example of the data being returned?
[13:17:57] <elit3x_> Taplar, https://dpaste.de/2VZd
[13:18:26] <Taplar> ok, yeah, so you'll either need to sort, or turn that into a real array
[13:20:01] <Taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/g5yd68k0/
[13:21:45] <elit3x_> Taplar, my end goal is to sort by the name field. this .sort() is sorting based of the ID
[13:23:51] <Taplar> elit3x_ you can give the sort a custom method to do that: https://jsfiddle.net/g5yd68k0/1/
[13:27:42] <elit3x_> Taplar, Thats an elegant solution. Thank you... The localCompare is new to me, but it makes sense...
[13:27:59] <Taplar> :)
[13:28:02] <elit3x_> Taplar, As far as the a & b parameters - Are those provided by the sort function? And im assuming a is the last value in the list and b is the current value from the itteration?
[13:28:43] <Taplar> They are two elements of the array that the sort method is passing in expecting you to tell it which one is before/after the other.  You can name them whatever.
[13:31:50] <elit3x_> Hmm ok, I see. Reading that does not come natural to me, but I will continue to disect it =) Thanks
[13:32:28] <Taplar> which part is confusing?
[13:41:27] <elit3x_> Taplar, So sort will always make 2 elements available? I do understand you can name them whatever, but im trying to understand where they are 'created'
[14:20:30] <paule32_> hello, you are right
[14:20:30] <paule32_> next problem
[14:20:30] <paule32_> http://dpaste.com/1NGXTEA
[14:20:30] <paule32_> how can i call/display the "lastdialog"
[14:21:17] <Taplar> you realise you're never attaching the lastdialog to the page?
[14:22:05] <Taplar> Unless extendeddialog does it.  I'm not familiar with that plugin
[14:22:15] <robertmaxrees> ^ make a fiddle :)
[14:57:35] <Taplar> https://imgur.com/R8fzLel
[15:34:41] <cek> Hi. It looks like $el = $('#id') would keep the reference to old element , even if that element was replaced by another one (via ajax call)
[15:34:56] <Taplar> yes
[15:35:15] <cek> I thought jquery objects would just keep selector  and reevaluate each time something's called on them
[15:35:21] <Taplar> no
[15:35:29] <Taplar> it's procedural logic, like all other javascript
[15:35:34] <Taplar> (the majority of)
[15:35:46] <cek> ok, but who are you?
[15:35:57] <robertmaxrees> lolwut
[15:36:01] <Taplar> random dude with some knowledge
[15:36:16] <cek> that's fine.
[15:39:36] <robertmaxrees> :confused:
[15:47:31] <paule32_> http://dpaste.com/3XSM5VZ
[15:47:46] <paule32_> that is the sample.html, that i dont understand
[15:48:01] <robertmaxrees> paule32_ what's your specific question?
[15:48:01] <Taplar> can you put that in a working fiddle, please?
[15:48:05] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^^^
[15:48:06] <robertmaxrees> this too
[15:49:32] <Taplar> and craaaaap
[15:49:37] <Taplar> please don't do: $('#chkMin').is(':checked')
[15:49:41] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[15:49:45] <Taplar> ....
[15:50:15] <Taplar> You don't need to use the pseudoselector once you get an element.  Just use $('#chkMin').prop('checked')
[15:52:41] <paule32_> https://jsfiddle.net/paule32/f9mvsyc7/4/
[15:53:01] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you include plugins, paule32_
[15:53:22] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/hTn7Wh1.png
[15:53:50] <robertmaxrees> also YOUR JS is supposed to go in that js box.
[15:55:11] <paule32_> can i use a simple append?
[15:55:21] <robertmaxrees> for what?
[15:55:26] <paule32_> the dialog
[15:55:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:55:33] <paule32_> lastdialog.append
[15:55:40] <robertmaxrees> we have no idea what you're even trying to do.
[15:56:23] <paule32_> i would like to use the extendeddialog plugin from jquery-ui as basis
[15:56:44] <robertmaxrees> there's no method called extendeddialog from jquery ui
[15:56:47] <paule32_> and, i don't know, how the dialog is opened at the sample
[15:57:04] <robertmaxrees> where did you get that plugin from,?
[15:57:12] <paule32_> from internet
[15:57:16] <robertmaxrees> where?
[15:57:25] <paule32_> there is a "click" event
[15:57:27] <paule32_> moment
[15:57:29] <robertmaxrees> your fiddle is currently incomprehensible.  trying to help you out.
[15:57:37] <robertmaxrees> but without a functioning fiddle, it's hard to help.
[16:00:08] <Taplar> https://github.com/CrazyTuna/jquery-extendeddialog looks like it might be it, but it literally extends "dialog".  It doesn't add a new method afaict
[16:00:15] <paule32_> https://github.com/CrazyTuna/jquery-extendeddialog
[16:00:48] <robertmaxrees> paule32_ so now
[16:00:48] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rn4k8d7p/1/
[16:00:53] <robertmaxrees> put your code in the fiddle.
[16:01:35] <robertmaxrees> not the code from the plugin or anything like that - make a test case.
[16:15:49] <paule32_> so i think i have it now
[16:16:23] <paule32_> how can i append div at the top also a first child of a parent div?
[16:16:31] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried?
[16:16:38] <paule32_> append
[16:16:44] <robertmaxrees> show us the code you've tried lol
[16:16:59] <paule32_> to big
[16:17:02] <paule32_> :)
[16:17:06] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:17:10] <paule32_> no, i get it
[16:17:14] <robertmaxrees> i'm asking for a test case.
[16:17:37] <paule32_> i give you
[16:20:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:21:20] <Taplar> The last fiddle i saw was the one with the improper library includes, and then robert asked for you to put a test case into an empty one he fixed the libraries on.  I have yet to see a working fiddle with your logic.
[16:21:29] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:21:48] <Taplar> Let alone one that tries to use append
[16:21:50] <robertmaxrees> i'd review https://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions for more info
[16:22:10] <robertmaxrees> until we see an actual test case, we can't help.
[16:23:42] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise: http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/
[16:24:35] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:28:56] <robertmaxrees> back
[16:31:54] <robertmaxrees> welp
[16:32:25] <Taplar> it must've been love.  but it's over now
[16:33:31] <robertmaxrees> ;__;
[16:50:58] <paule32_> so next trouble
[16:51:00] <paule32_> http://dpaste.com/17G4XMQ
[16:51:06] <paule32_> is that code valid?
[16:51:26] <robertmaxrees> "valid"?
[16:51:37] <paule32_> i have the same div code in the same html
[16:51:55] <robertmaxrees> are you having an issue?
[16:52:02] <paule32_> it should me display a widget window
[16:53:00] <amalgameate> hi there, does anyone know if it's possible to trigger the change event on a select dropdown when the user selects the currently selected option
[16:53:23] <robertmaxrees> paule32_ so what's the problem?
[16:53:28] <amalgameate> the default behavior for .change() only triggers when the user selects a different option
[16:54:00] <NitroLiq> Because you're 'changing' options
[16:54:34] <amalgameate> ya, it makes sense.  but, i'm wondering if anyone knows of a way to fire an event when the user clicks on an option, regardless of whether it changes or not
[16:55:06] <Taplar> might try putting a click handler on the options
[16:56:50] <amalgameate> Taplar: i did some research on that and it seems like click events are not triggered on option elements in some recent versions of chrome
[16:57:41] <paule32_> robertmaxrees: it is not display after "click" event and append(htmlcode
[16:58:29] <robertmaxrees> paule32_ show the failing code then.
[16:58:31] <robertmaxrees> a test case.
[17:58:59] <NitroLiq> Quick question. I have a multi-select with an onchange handler that removes a hide class on another input when 'other' is selected. How do I refactor the condition so that this triggers as long as 'other' is ticked whether or not other options in the list are ticked as well?
[17:59:01] <NitroLiq> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/jRaGEd?editors=1010
[18:00:21] <Taplar> on change, find all the ones that are ticked
[18:00:30] <Taplar> and perform your logic based on if any of them are "other"
[18:00:40] <Taplar> right now you are only considering the one that is currently (un)ticked
[18:02:00] <Taplar> though actually in the case that multiple are selected, the value is an array which will or will not contain "other"
[18:02:07] <Taplar> so you could just check the array
[18:07:18] <Taplar> @NitroLiq https://codepen.io/anon/pen/EJQzYr?editors=1010
[18:09:25] <NitroLiq> includes....that's where I was having trouble. Everything I looked at dealt with using indexOf
[18:09:33] <NitroLiq> Thanks
[18:09:51] <Taplar> you can do the same thing with indexOf(value) > -1
[18:11:48] <NitroLiq> Yeah, that's what I was reading up on but go confused with how to implement it properly
[18:35:06] <paule32_> i have a div container
[18:35:08] <paule32_>     <div class="easyui-panel"
[18:35:31] <paule32_> all childs within this div are not able to draggable
[18:35:34] <paule32_> why?
[18:35:48] <robertmaxrees> literally no way we can answer that question
[18:45:34] <paule32_> magic things go on here on my side
[18:45:44] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[18:46:16] <paule32_> that make me clear, that i have to recode all my code that used 3third party code to be productive
[18:46:35] <robertmaxrees> wat
[18:47:40] <paule32_> i spent hours for making website, but not productive, because all packages cross over the other packages
[18:47:48] <paule32_> it works now
[18:47:56] <paule32_> but with my own code
[18:47:56] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you just need to slow down and read documentation :shrug:
[18:48:13] <paule32_> jquery is not the problem
[18:48:22] <robertmaxrees> i never said it is?
[18:48:27] <paule32_> the plugins
[18:48:51] <robertmaxrees> i don't think most people have that many issues using plugins but :shrug:
[18:49:53] <paule32_> i will not say that they f..., but "repect who is made self made men"
[18:50:12] <robertmaxrees> not even sure what you're talking about at this point lol
[18:50:31] <paule32_> 1:1 translating from germany
[18:50:42] <robertmaxrees> 'k
[18:50:48] <robertmaxrees> so did you need any help?
[18:51:14] <paule32_> not yet at this time, you can go to bed :-)
[18:51:24] <paule32_> thanks for your pation
[18:51:27] <robertmaxrees> uh, it's the afternoon here.
[18:51:29] <robertmaxrees> but okay
[19:19:19] <paule32_> http://dpaste.com/0P62T0N
[19:19:41] <paule32_> where the fu.. easy-ui-window?
[20:24:09] <ironbeard> A bit of a jQuery n00b, but: I'm using another script that turns a <select> box into two <selects>, one that has the available options and one that shows which ones have been selected. The script adds <option> values to an empty <select> box when certain events happen (and there's an add/remove all, filter, etc). I would like to fire a separate function each time the number of <options> in the "to"
[20:24:15] <ironbeard> <select> changes, is there a "straightforward" way of doing this? I've tried to hook into the original script, but I can't seem to access any of its events or add callbacks.
[20:24:42] <robertmaxrees> any docs?
[20:24:48] <robertmaxrees> a jsfiddle would be good, too.
[20:25:54] <ironbeard> robertmaxrees: I have a running site, would that work? The jquery scripts I'm using are actually part of a Django project, using some of it's scripts.
[20:26:09] <robertmaxrees> eh, not really - isolated test cases are preferred.
[20:26:35] <ironbeard> Understandable, let me see
[20:32:39] <ironbeard> Yeah, I hate to not be able to provide the relevant context, but since it relies on a collection of Django js scripts, I'm not sure if I'll be able to pull it off. If you don't want to mess with it, no worries. I guess another way to posit the question is: does jQuery have any methods for determining when the number of child elements to a specified parent element changes? or would it require storing the
[20:32:46] <ironbeard> number of children and checking the parent regularly?
[20:32:58] <robertmaxrees> what'
[20:33:02] <robertmaxrees> *what's the page, then?
[20:33:09] <robertmaxrees> and there are ways to do it but that's a really bad idea.
[20:33:55] <ironbeard> Thanks :) the css is a bit messed up right now, but it's at http://data.ironbeard.org:8888/accounts/subscribe
[20:34:05] <robertmaxrees> and where, exactly, do i see the issue?
[20:34:15] <robertmaxrees> and where's the js located?
[20:34:28] <ironbeard> When a region is selected and added to the bottom box, I want to catch that event so I can highlight the SVG map with the relevant regions
[20:34:41] <robertmaxrees> back up
[20:34:43] <ironbeard> I guess right now the js is in line -_-
[20:34:44] <robertmaxrees> that's not what you said earlier.
[20:34:47] <ironbeard> okay okay, sorry
[20:34:49] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:34:57] <robertmaxrees> so you just want to know when one is added?
[20:35:02] <ironbeard> or removed
[20:35:07] <robertmaxrees> let's start with added :)
[20:35:18] <ironbeard> I like it:)
[20:35:28] <robertmaxrees> any docs for this widget?"
[20:36:08] <ironbeard> unfortunately, I haven't been able to find them. Django considers this widget part of their "behind the scenes" stuff that they don't typically want users to use outside of the Django admin stuff.
[20:36:19] <ironbeard> But the sources are at..
[20:37:06] <robertmaxrees> ah so wait
[20:37:33] <robertmaxrees> back up even further - the entire point of django is to be modular.  why not build/use something that actually does what you want?
[20:37:49] <ironbeard> data.ironbeard.org:8888/static/js/SelectBox.js and data.ironbeard.org:8888/static/admin/js/SelectFilter2.js
[20:38:00] <ironbeard> hmm
[20:38:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah i already see the event binding ;)
[20:38:38] <ironbeard> Well, I figured I'd reuse their widget as much as possible?
[20:38:55] <robertmaxrees> the bigger issue is that you're going to fight against this as-is.  long term when you update django there's no guarantee that your tweaks will work.,
[20:39:11] <robertmaxrees> and django's completely modular.  the entire point is to replace things as needed.
[20:39:21] <robertmaxrees> well, not the entire point, but you get the gist.
[20:39:21] <ironbeard> but I don't think (based on my time in Chrome console) that I can directly link into their event, so I was hoping to just determine when the "to" <select> adds/removes children
[20:39:30] <ironbeard> for sure
[20:39:40] <robertmaxrees> so that's not a thing.
[20:39:41] <ironbeard> yeah..good point about updates
[20:40:14] <robertmaxrees> as-is, your best bet is to hook into clicks on those add/remove buttons, read the contents of the "chosen forecasts" and do whatever you need to the map.
[20:40:24] <ironbeard> yeah
[20:40:31] <robertmaxrees> but you'd have to make sure your code fires after the other stuff.
[20:40:41] <ironbeard> But I think on mobile the clicks for the add/remove buttons are necessary
[20:40:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:40:51] <ironbeard> but I guess I could add those clicks to the same function
[20:41:05] <robertmaxrees> not surte what you're talking about now.
[20:41:39] <ironbeard> I //think// that when using this select widget on mobile, you don't need to use the add/remove buttons, you just click on an option. But, that's getting ahead of the issue I think
[20:41:52] <robertmaxrees> one thing at a time :)
[20:41:56] <ironbeard> agreed :)
[20:41:57] <robertmaxrees> that's an easy fix, too, fwiw.
[20:42:09] <robertmaxrees> so yeah, build a component that actually does what you want.
[20:43:24] <ironbeard> I think that's fair. It'll also force me to dig into jquery in a deeper level, I've mainly just messed around with events
[20:44:10] <ironbeard> thanks for the patience and advice
[20:44:16] <robertmaxrees> :) really won't be that hard.  you could even find the source for this particular thing and fork it.
[20:44:37] <ironbeard> yeah, for sure
[20:47:48] <ironbeard> thanks again!
[20:47:54] <robertmaxrees> :) definitely
[21:26:16] <DJDan_> With Jquery how do i get a get my session cookie?
[21:26:23] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[21:26:24] <robertmaxrees> :)
[21:26:43] <DJDan_> why not
[21:26:46] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't do cookies
[21:26:58] <robertmaxrees> it's a DOM abstraction lib.
[21:27:18] <DJDan_> well then how do i do it through there.. document.cookie doesnt get it
[21:27:29] <DJDan_> apparently $.cookie used to work through jquery
[21:27:33] <robertmaxrees> is the session cookie http only?
[21:27:50] <DJDan_> i think so yes
[21:27:58] <DJDan_> it shows up as a http session cookie
[21:28:00] <robertmaxrees> then you can't read it via js at all
[21:28:42] <DJDan_> so id need to do a curl get post to login and read it from that?
[21:28:52] <DJDan_> curl post*
[21:29:00] <robertmaxrees> why do you need the session cookie at all?
[21:29:52] <DJDan_> cause i need both the sessionid and tokenid to control my router
[21:30:09] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[21:30:19] <robertmaxrees> those are going to be hidden from JS for security purposes.
[21:30:20] <robertmaxrees> heh
[21:31:15] <DJDan_> well the tokenid is stored in the token variable.. i was just after the sessionid which i can see under 'application -> cookies'
[21:31:16] <robertmaxrees> which makes it outside of the purview of this channel :)
[22:48:50] <DJDan_> Cork:  echo "user" | openssl enc -des-ede3   .. but it keeps asking for a decryption password for some reason
[22:54:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah, not the right channel my dude :)
[23:27:25] <DJDan_> robertmaxrees: its the one with him in it my dude :)
[23:31:06] <robertmaxrees> doesn't change the topic ;)
