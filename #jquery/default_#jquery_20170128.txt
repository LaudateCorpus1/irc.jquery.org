[00:03:06] <aiena> I am using bootstrap 3.3.6 and jquery 2.2.4

[03:15:49] <cerkauskas> hello. I do ajax call like this: https://gist.github.com/cerkauskas/56a1766476b272d741647dbfffebc6b4 however, when response code is 400, it is not handled as error, it throws error to console. what am I doing wrong?
[03:17:53] <cerkauskas> whoops, it is. I just fuked up somewhere else :) sorry for disturbing. have a great weekend!
[03:50:30] <harrypotter0> hi
[05:04:44] <itsgokul> will jquery table sorter work for existing table with pagination
[07:17:50] <alxy> Hello, are there any know circumstances when .focus() doesnt work? I put this code directly into the console: $('input[name="listToolbarSearch[term]"]').focus(); (it selects the correct input, I checked that by removing the .focus() ) however, the cursor is not placed in the field
[08:43:27] <bbear> Hello
[08:43:34] <bbear> I'm looking for a way to solve this : XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:8000/api-token-auth/. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource
[08:56:26] <Seminarian> Hey guys, I was wondering if it's possible to run some jquery code on an external webpage? How to go about it? Through console or are there other tricks?
[08:58:50] <Calinou> Seminarian: if you want to run JavaScript code on a web page that you didn't create, try an userscript (Tampermonkey)
[08:59:14] <Seminarian> Calinou, thanks I'll google it
[11:14:52] <bbear> hello
[11:15:03] <bbear> $.post is not returning any data AFAIK
[11:15:10] <bbear> what's the problem exactly ?
[11:18:24] <bbear> I would like to be able to execute some action in case of failure. Would it be possible.
[12:14:30] <Seminarian> On a website the value of a <td> gets changed from time to time. I've tried $("").change but that doesn't get triggered
[12:14:50] <Seminarian> how can I detect value change of the content of the td?
[12:18:13] <snover> Seminarian: you can use mutation observers, though you probably should fix your code so that whatever updates the dom content can be hooked instead.
[12:18:36] <Seminarian> snover, it's on an external website. I'm making a userscript
[12:18:45] <Seminarian> I'll google mutation observers
[12:19:40] <Seminarian> Is it 1 line of code or is it something like 20?
[12:19:45] <Seminarian> just to check if i'm on the right page
[12:24:25] <dglambert> yo
[13:15:03] <bbear> any advice as how to handle ajax requests ?
[13:38:54] <impliednude> http://pastebin.com/7yqMM5dc - getting undefined error at .cycle
[13:53:05] <Scoop7> I would need jquery ajax to return my get request not all when it's ready, but one by one let's say after every php loop i would like to get an jquery ajax request delivered to my page. Any good leads, tips ?
[13:54:07] <Scoop7> Also is this possible with jquery ajax or i will need to use js ajax ?
[13:58:09] <bbear> not clear question
[13:58:11] <bbear> my turn.
[13:58:41] <bbear> When I use .get, the data is encoded into the URL. I would like it to be passed as JSON in the HTTP body message. How would I do that ?
[14:23:12] <Scoop7> bbear: Your request has expired - my turn. So to simplify my question can I make jquery ajax request deliver my result not in one piece but in many smaller pieces(because there are many loops involved and it could take several minutes before the request is ready) ? Or this is only possible with using vanilla js ajax?
[14:24:28] <mann> You're trying to request info from the same web service?
[14:25:17] <Scoop7> mann: yes! the same website
[14:26:30] <mann> And the results from the service take too long?
[14:26:39] <mann> I suppose I don't fully understand what you're asking.
[14:26:48] <Scoop7> to be precise i'm requesting for a .php file which is doing some web scrapping (looping websites and delivering urls) .
[14:27:17] <Scoop7> Yes it's taking long because some of the websites are really big and have many pages....
[14:27:50] <Scoop7> So i would like to render my jquery ajax request in parts, so that the user would have a better experience
[14:28:10] <Scoop7> I can give an live example...
[14:28:14] <Scoop7> if that would help
[14:29:32] <Scoop7> just checked - my live example is down...
[14:31:59] <Scoop7> I mean haven't  you seen examples where data is being loaded in parts(one by one), but not when the whole html is finished rendering
[14:32:01] <bbear> Scoop7: that's not the client that may do that. Unless... well I see what you mean. You want to serve content without the request being ended.
[14:32:22] <bbear> That's very asynchronous of you but I don't see how you can do that.
[14:34:25] <Scoop7> So basically you mean that this is not possible with jquery? Will need to use js where I can adjust all the process/parameters in a lower level ?
[14:36:12] <bbear> Scoop7: I don't see how it would be possible with HTTP anyway
[14:36:33] <bbear> since the protocol is just Query/Answer based, what you would like seems really low level.
[14:36:57] <bbear> You have to do a client/server stuff to do what you want.
[14:36:58] <Scoop7> i don't know how overs are achieving this result, but the are creating this effect. Maybe they are using multiple ajax requests.
[14:37:06] <bbear> I think so
[14:37:11] <bbear> Or promises
[14:37:26] <bbear> Something involving lazy evaluation probably.
[14:37:43] <bbear> But in the end they are all different ajax requests executed asynchronously I believe.
[15:37:28] <raymondt_> Hi
[15:42:17] <Seminarian> I've made a userscript where when some data changes in a td a value is filled in and a button is clicked. That works and all goes well. An overlay popup shows up in the DOM of the page. I want to click it but the click doesn't work. If i put the exact same command in the console the click is registered
[15:42:48] <Seminarian> Any thoughts? I've been searchin for hours
[15:44:48] <mann> Seminarian, by overlay popup are you referring to a modal window?
[15:45:33] <Seminarian> mann, something like this: http://interactivevolcano.com/grayed-out-overlays-with-jquery-and-css
[15:46:08] <Seminarian> It's a div with id #faded that gets added first time.
[15:46:17] <Seminarian> the times after that display:none get removed from it
[15:47:29] <mann> And your clicks on this element aren't being registered?
[15:47:52] <Seminarian> Not in my userscript
[15:48:10] <Seminarian> when the overlay popup is active and I paste the selector.click(); it works
[15:51:17] <mann> Could I see a snippet of your code?
[15:51:32] <mann> https://hastebin.com/
[15:52:23] <Seminarian> Okay will put it there, beware it's crappy code i've been adding stuff just try and solve it!
[15:53:11] <Seminarian> and i'm a php programmer normally :-)
[15:53:51] <mann> No worries
[15:54:02] <Seminarian> mann, https://hastebin.com/eqifaruhow.js
[15:54:42] <Seminarian> line 58 to 68
[15:54:56] <Seminarian> the click() that is being spammed is the one not working
[15:55:43] <Seminarian> $(".btn-confirm-yes").click();
[15:56:21] <Seminarian> the first time the script runs this button is not yet existent in the dom. The second time it can exist
[15:56:43] <Seminarian> $(".btn-premium-exchange-buy").click(); after this one it gets created
[16:08:19] <Seminarian> mann, any thoughts?
[16:14:17] <mann> Er sorry, had to take the puppers out
[16:14:22] <mann> Taking a look
[16:18:26] <Seminarian> k np
[16:18:37] <Seminarian> i've removed the while loops and testing with a 100ms delay
[16:19:13] <mann> So $(".btn-confirm-yes").click(); works in all other instances except during the overlay?
[16:19:24] <Seminarian> nopz
[16:19:35] <Seminarian> when the overlay is there it works in the console
[16:19:38] <Seminarian> but never in the script
[16:23:23] <Seminarian> that fixed it!
[16:23:58] <Seminarian> i've replaced the while loops with setTimeout(function() { $(".btn-confirm-yes").click();}, 100);
[16:24:07] <Seminarian> thanks for your time mann
[16:28:45] <mann> lol, got pulled away again.. glad you got it working
[16:29:08] <Seminarian> hahaha np :-)
[16:29:26] <Seminarian> something crazy about a while and incrementing and counting the loops i guess
[16:31:35] <Scoop7> bbear: ", have a call that starts a server-side queue job, have that job update some status holder somewhere, have a ajax call polling that status holder. " - What about this approach ??
[16:40:05] <bbear> yes but it's not RESTful
[16:40:37] <bbear> What I would do is indeed to do a server-side iterator
[17:11:14] <Seminarian> an element contains this when i do $(selector).html() : "<img src="https://dsen.innogamescdn.com/8.70/32101/graphic/resources/stone_18x16.png" alt=""> 64"
[17:11:20] <Seminarian> how to extract the number?
[17:14:37] <shoky> .text() ?
[17:16:27] <Seminarian> alright sounds legit, bummer it adds some crap from other elements :
[17:16:57] <Seminarian> but will fix it, thanks shoky i'm noob obviously
[22:02:45] <jak2000> hi all
