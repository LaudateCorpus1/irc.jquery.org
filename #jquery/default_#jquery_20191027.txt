[08:45:24] <pipp8> Hi all, I really can't understand how $(this) should work, from doc $(this) selector refers or stands for the current selected object in a loop or event , so why this example don't work as expected? https://jsfiddle.net/5ch347wb/1/ ?
[09:01:32] <berndj> is there an easy way i can do what .replaceWith() does, except one level down the tree of each matched element?
[09:02:13] <berndj> and no, i don't want to futz around with slinging html as strings around
[09:04:44] <berndj> does .empty().append(some_stuff) sound like what i just asked for?
[09:55:49] <pipp8> ok, so writing ()=>{} or function(){} is very different. may you point me to some explanation of this?

[12:39:08] <Cork> pipp8: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions
[12:39:20] <Cork> arrow functions is ecmascript 7
[12:39:33] <Cork> *6
[12:40:27] <Cork> biggest difference to ecmascript 5 is that it doesn't have this or arguments as local variables
[12:40:39] <Cork> *ecmascript 5 functions*
