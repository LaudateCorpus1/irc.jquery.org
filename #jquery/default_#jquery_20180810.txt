[16:29:13] <how2hack> hi, why is it that i can't do a: $.each('article#id > figure > figcaption > input', function() {}) ??? i'm getting a TypeError: cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'lenght' in 'article#id ...'
[16:33:35] <pavonia> I don't think each() takes a selector as argument
[16:36:00] <how2hack> $('article#id > figure > figcaption > input').each(function() {}) this doesn't give me the error
[16:36:21] <taplar> i would assume the first one might try to each over the characters of the string
[16:36:31] <taplar> but the second one is going to each over the result stack
[16:38:06] <taplar> yeah so the first one is just an incorrect usage that jQuery doesn't have a sanity check for
[16:38:35] <how2hack> the second one makes more sense
[16:39:19] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/9a512rxb/1/
[16:40:06] <taplar> it's just a utility method.  $().each most likely also uses it under the hood
[16:40:53] <taplar> https://j11y.io/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.fn.each  yep
[16:45:42] <how2hack> interesting site, so the first one treats it as a simple string, right? the second is a jquery dom object
[16:46:05] <taplar> The first one expects either an array or an object
[16:46:18] <taplar> and doesn't know what to do with a string
[16:46:31] <taplar> the second expects a string, or dom element, or array of dom elements
[16:46:44] <taplar> it knows to expect a selector or html in a string
[16:49:02] <how2hack> hmm is there a way to add new items to an object, in the form of variables inside an each?
[16:49:47] <taplar> sure, an object has keys set to values, so you can just obj.newKey = <new value>  or  obj['newKey'] = <new value>
[16:50:07] <taplar> Objects are mutable like that
[16:50:19] <how2hack> inside the each, i need this.id to be a new item in the object, i don't think i've done this yet, i know how to access them or make them manually {} but not inside each
[16:50:46] <taplar> can you explain the first part more?  not sure i follow what you mean
[16:50:50] <how2hack> so obj.this.id?
[16:51:23] <taplar> I would advise you to stear clear of naming variables in an object "this".
[16:51:26] <how2hack> i have an empty object var obj = {}, now inside the .each() i want this.id as a new entry
[16:51:45] <taplar> It's a special word in javascript, and using it in other ways can easily lead to confusion
[16:52:18] <taplar> so I assume this.id should be the key in the object for the new entry?
[16:52:22] <how2hack> i don't want the object this, i want the id of the element to be the new entry
[16:52:25] <how2hack> yes
[16:52:32] <taplar> and what is the 'new entry'?
[16:52:54] <how2hack> obj = { "this.id": '...' }
[16:53:09] <taplar> obj[this.id] = <new entry>
[16:53:18] <taplar> you don't want the literal 'this.id' to be your key
[16:53:25] <taplar> you want the value of the id varialbe
[16:53:43] <how2hack> that's exactly what i've already tried
[16:53:57] <taplar> ok, so can you show us what you tried in a fiddle?
[16:53:58] <how2hack> but i'm getting a TypeError: info[this.id] is undefined
[16:54:13] <taplar> info has to exist before you can put something in it
[16:54:23] <how2hack> like it's trying to access it instead of creating it
[16:54:38] <taplar> ok, yeah, i need to see what you are doing to advise more
[16:54:38] <how2hack> yes, i've declared it outside the .each() so i can use it later
[16:54:45] <how2hack> sure
[16:55:22] <how2hack> https://jsfiddle.net/chazy/h9mz7csd/
[16:55:53] <taplar> info[this.id]['price'] <-- this is your problem.  you are trying to create a two dimensional object in a single step
[16:56:05] <taplar> you have to create the 1d first, before the 2d
[16:56:28] <taplar> or you actually can do it in a single step
[16:56:43] <taplar> info[this.id] = {price: self.data('price')}
[16:56:58] <taplar> then the second one for units would work as it is
[16:57:03] <how2hack> yes, that makes more sense
[16:57:04] <taplar> or you could combine them
[16:57:13] <taplar> info[this.id] = {price: self.data('price'), units: self.val()}
[16:57:40] <how2hack> i've actually done that many times in php, but different brackets confuse me...
[16:57:55] <how2hack> it's not exactly the same
[16:58:21] <taplar> in javascript, [] notation can be used for object or array access
[16:58:33] <taplar> for object access you give it the property as a string
[16:58:49] <taplar> {} in javascript creates a new Object
[16:59:00] <taplar> if not used as an expression block
[17:00:23] <how2hack> thanks
[17:04:07] <sine0> hey there anyone about. when using jQuery.ajax and you pass a variable like data: { action:'the_function',variable:'the variable data'} how does the function get access to the variable
[17:04:27] <taplar> which variable specifically?
[17:04:33] <sine0> variable
[17:04:49] <taplar> "variable" is a property of the data object
[17:05:00] <sine0> data.variable
[17:05:04] <taplar> yeah
[17:05:30] <sine0> so how does the php function get that function super_function( data.variable ) {}
[17:05:54] <taplar> If you do a basic ajax GET/POST request, jQuery will turn that object into a query string
[17:06:02] <taplar> which php will parse into the $_GET or $_POST variables
[17:06:51] <thecliguy> The following code produces a textarea, as text is entered it is parsed as markdown and generates html. The resultant html is displayed beneath the textarea. https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=FU4OMKUPPVE9
[17:06:53] <thecliguy> Please can someone show me how I can obtain the value of the html? I'd like to output it an alert for now.
[17:08:06] <taplar> thecliguy: in your browser, right click on the output and choose to "inspect"
[17:08:17] <taplar> tell me once you've done that.
[17:08:49] <thecliguy> Are you going to suggest obtaining the value of the control which holds the html preview?
[17:09:17] <taplar> the markup is encapsulated by a div with the "markdown-preview" class.  You can grab the contents by finding that element by the class.
[17:09:50] <thecliguy> I've inspected the element.
[17:10:08] <taplar> You see the markup I'm talking about?
[17:10:40] <thecliguy> <div class="markdown-preview">
[17:10:46] <taplar> yep
[17:12:10] <thecliguy> I wasn't aware that i could get the value using the class name. I thought it would have to be something unique, like name.
[17:12:28] <thecliguy> How would I go about doing it based on the class?
[17:12:35] <taplar> nope, if that's the only element on your page with that class, you can safely grab it by the class
[17:12:45] <taplar> $('.markdown-preview').html()
[17:13:02] <taplar> Similar to how CSS makes rules for elements, '.' denotes a class
[17:13:31] <taplar> Just like how your snippet is looking up the markdown-toolbar by class
[17:16:06] <thecliguy> Gosh - thank you. That's exactly what I needed, $('.markdown-preview').html()
[17:16:21] <taplar> awesome
[17:17:27] <thecliguy> Is there a "safer" way to obtain the value if there happened to be another control with the same class?
[17:17:47] <thecliguy> Just curious.
[17:18:25] <taplar> you could put a wrapper around your textarea.  I would assume the plugin is creating the preview after the element you initialize it on.
[17:18:27] <taplar> lets see...
[17:18:58] <thecliguy> I had wondered if there's a method I should be calling which would return the html.
[17:19:30] <taplar> https://www.w3schools.com/code/tryit.asp?filename=FU6B25IEMMBB
[17:19:35] <thecliguy> But my inexperience in the language left me baffled.
[17:19:55] <taplar> so i put a div around the html element with an id on it.  If you inspect the page again, you'll see the textarea and preview are inside it
[17:20:26] <taplar> So doing something like this would let you do $('#markdownToolbarOne .markdown-preview').html()  to limit which one you find
[17:25:54] <sine0> taplar: thanks for htat bro
[17:27:14] <thecliguy> taplar: Thank you, much appreciated.
[17:27:34] <taplar> np @ both
[17:54:16] <taplar> mofo weekend yo!  l8r
[18:16:02] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[23:39:41] <Jcc10> This might be a stupid question but... I want to use jQuery-UI with electron, I got normal jQuery setup "const jqueryInt = require('jquery');" How would I extend that with jQuery-UI?
[23:44:28] <Jcc10> jqueryInt is immediately moved into window.$ and window.jquery
