[01:12:32] <jak2000> wich plugin for draw charts recommend me?
[01:12:35] <jak2000> hi all
[06:37:09] <Woodpecker> Newish to Jquery. Trying to script youtube uploading bypassing the API, using only the website. I am stuck at the part where I click the <input type=file> element. I cant get it to click with jquery to issue the prompt.
[06:38:30] <Cork> Woodpecker: you mean you're trying to automate the website with a userscript?
[06:40:00] <Woodpecker> Cork: yeah, automate the website. I can log in, select account, and get to www.youtube.com/upload fine.
[06:40:28] <Cork> Woodpecker: you can try $('input[type="file"]')[0].click()
[06:40:51] <Woodpecker> Cork: sure. I was trying:
[06:40:56] <Woodpecker>   var button = document.querySelector('input[type="file"]');
[06:40:56] <Woodpecker>     if (button) { button.click(); }
[06:41:05] <Cork> but browsers are a bit reluctant to allow faked clicks events and in some cases you can't do it
[06:41:24] <Cork> also that isn't jquery so you prob want to take that in ##javascript
[06:41:35] <Woodpecker> Cork: thanks
[06:41:40] <Woet> Woodpecker: why do you want to bypass the API?
[06:41:56] <Woodpecker> Woet: 100 video per day limit.
[06:42:07] <Cork> ...
[06:42:12] <Woodpecker> Woet: you can upload additional through the website. Dont ask me why.
[06:42:44] <Woodpecker> Cork: its not what you are thinking. I upload audiobooks, and I just have... a ton of them
[06:44:10] <Woodpecker> yeah no dice.
[06:45:31] <Woet> Woodpecker: have you tried uploading a lot through the website? cause as far as I know, similar limits apply.
[06:45:59] <Woodpecker> Woet: I dont have an exact number. They say 300 simultaneous is not allowed.
[06:46:12] <Woet> Woodpecker: most resources online are pointing towards a 50/day upload limit through the site
[06:46:17] <Woet> https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/youtube/Xi5hGjsmiG8/b0heE5jMAgAJ
[06:46:38] <Woet> Woodpecker: also, as far as I can tell, the API has enough credits to upload 625 videos/day
[06:46:43] <Woodpecker> Woet: cool. That sounds about right now that I think about it.
[06:47:17] <Woet> Woodpecker: for audiobooks, you should probably go with something like soundcloud.
[06:47:21] <Woodpecker> Woet: it caps me out at 100. There is only one way around that, but I cant utilize that option yet.
[06:47:37] <Woodpecker> Woet: any money to be made by uploading there?
[06:47:57] <Woet> Woodpecker: unsure. do you actually own the rights on these audiobooks?
[06:47:58] <Woodpecker> also my audiobooks come with video
[06:48:19] <Woodpecker> Woet: its Creative Commons license that allowes for profitting.
[06:48:29] <Woet> sounds like a very shady way of making money
[06:49:31] <Woodpecker> I dont think so. Most of my comments are really happy about what I am doing. Helping educate the world
[06:49:59] <Woet> then why does it matter if you can make money on soundcloud? :)
[06:50:35] <Woet> anyways, yea, doing file uploads with userscripts/javascript is tricky (for obvious reasons)
[06:50:49] <Woet> they are specifically designed to require user interaction
[06:51:26] <Woodpecker> Woet: Because I need money to eat.
[06:51:34] <Woet> thats what jobs are for
[06:51:35] <Woet> but sure

[06:52:32] * AdamPDotty should work some day.
[06:53:06] <Woodpecker> Woet: anyway thanks for the feedback. Considering im pretty green with jquery... I am probably going to put this on the backburner
[07:06:03] <escherial> hey, say i have markup like this: <li><h4>some text</h4> some more text here</li>; how would i go about getting the extra text in the <li> without the <h4> tag?
[07:06:31] <escherial> i've tried $("h4").siblings().html(), but that only returns the text if it's within a tag
[07:07:03] <Cork> escherial: recommended is to add the extra text in a span
[07:07:24] <Cork> else you would have to clone the li, and then remove the h4 from the clone and then take .html() or .text() from that
[07:07:56] <escherial> Cork: i'm scraping some help docs that another member of my team is writing using markdown, so i unfortunately don't have control over the source
[07:08:13] <escherial> cloning it and removing the h4 makes sense
[07:08:25] <Cork> ok, then var clone = $('li').clone(); clone.find('h4).remove(); clone.html()
[07:08:30] <Woet> your team member is deaf and blind so you can't talk to them?
[07:08:32] <Woet> that sucks
[07:08:41] <Cork> ya...
[07:08:52] <escherial> Woet: help documentation in this project is extremely political and i'm not in a position with leverage to change anything
[07:08:57] <Cork> why i don't like to have hard separations between teams
[07:09:07] <Woet> sounds like you should leave it asap
[07:09:46] * escherial shrugs
[09:48:15] <toothfairy_> Hi, trying to generate a list from json data, but I only get the output [object Object] in my browser, any ideas? https://dpaste.de/7mCp
[10:34:30] <shoky> toothfairy_: that's the string representation of an object. if you want to output each one as json, use JSON.stringify(val) in your loop
[10:35:14] <shoky> or JSON.stringify(val,0,2) if you want pretty json.  though a browser wouldn't really render it pretty unless it's in a <pre> or something
[10:50:58] <jak2000> hi all

[11:46:22] <jomofcw> Hello !
[11:47:34] <jomofcw> Is there a way to detect that a fragment have been added to the URI, please ? e.g. when my user click an A element that lead to this fragment, I'll do some stuff (without binding the click event).
[11:53:24] <jomofcw> Found the hashchange event, so fixed ^^.
[12:13:13] <\Kalascus> How do I get a child element of "this" in a .each(function() { ... })
[12:15:41] <\Kalascus> $(".foo span") is only getting the element for the first run of the function
[12:18:33] <\Kalascus> Basically, how do I get $(".foo span") from $(this)
[12:19:35] <Paradisee> hello, i got this code: https://dpaste.de/5k5u
[12:19:59] <Paradisee> i can find items using django and so on, but i'm not able to show them properly in the page.

[16:39:29] <taplar> evening
[18:10:49] <jak2000> hi all
[18:10:51] <jak2000> anyone here worked with chartjs?  i have a dude:   backgroundColor: ['#504A4B','#848482','#566D7E','#1569C7','#3EA99F','#41A317','#FFEBCD','#954535','#82CAFF','#B87333','#659EC7'],    i defined 11 Color Bars, my BIG dude is what happend if the Graph have 20 bars? the 12,13,.... have last color i think, but.... how to define 20 colors? exist a way?
[18:12:08] <taplar> this doesn't look like a jQuery plugin
[18:13:35] <taplar> i'd suggest asking in ##javascript
[18:40:01] <jak2000> thanks
[18:40:11] <jak2000> taplar wuch chart plugin do you use?
[18:40:23] <taplar> none of my apps have charts
[18:40:34] <jak2000> any thta recomend me?
[18:40:59] <taplar> i haven't dealt with charts enough to be able to
[18:41:09] <jak2000> understood
[18:54:29] <ryan_ford> did you not like chartjs?
[18:54:59] <jak2000> ryan_ford mmm
[18:55:04] <jak2000> i am testing wich recommend me?
[18:55:06] <jak2000> you use
[18:55:59] <ryan_ford> I haven't had need for any, but I would probably use that or d3
[18:56:22] <ryan_ford> being proficient with d3 is a fairly marketable skill
[18:57:22] <jak2000> my problem is how to generate 2o different colors....
[18:57:40] <jak2000> of course if i have 4 bars only need 4 colors, but (extremely) if need 50 generate 50 ...
[19:01:53] <jak2000> ryan_ford is d3 or c3?
[19:01:58] <jak2000> https://c3js.org/gettingstarted.html
[20:16:39] <ryan_ford> d3
[20:18:18] <ryan_ford> c3 appears to be some sort of abstraction of d3, so it's still actually dependent on d3
[21:48:21] <treilss> https://masonry.desandro.com/ i'm trying to use this on unordered list, but i'm not seeing any effect
[21:48:31] <treilss> does this not work on list items?
