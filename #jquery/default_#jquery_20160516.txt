[02:11:34] <php916> >>  so i have a bit of a problem, form returns respons with length 0 and 231b http://pastie.org/private/x2e64bf9szqcmfq922bfsa
[02:19:24] <Cork> php916: you mean result contains that?
[02:23:42] <php916> Cork, yes
[02:23:53] <Cork> php916: then you have to check your server code
[02:24:10] <php916> it's alright and it executes perfectly
[02:24:35] <Cork> well the content you get here is what it returns
[02:24:40] <php916> form for some reason can't get an output from it
[02:24:56] <php916> and recieves no response
[02:26:41] <Cork> php916: the form has no relation to this
[02:27:00] <Cork> php916: you grab some fields from the form and then make an ajax call
[02:27:14] <Cork> the server response content then ends up in result
[02:27:31] <Cork> what the server puts in the response body is what you get in result
[02:27:37] <Cork> so again, check the server code
[02:40:29] <php916> alright, more specific question
[02:41:21] <php916> how exactly do i fade in & wait for 5sec & fadeout [$('#frm_result').fadeIn().html('<b>Подождите...</b>').fadeOut();]
[02:41:53] <systemfault> .delay IIRC
[02:42:01] <php916> i was using delay(5000) but behaviour stayed the same
[02:43:08] <Cork> php916: use the callback
[02:43:38] <Cork> .html is not animation aware
[02:43:47] <Cork> so you have to do that modification in a callback
[02:44:13] <dhs1111> hi
[02:46:00] <php916> sooo...like http://pastie.org/private/ffs6iajx8ryxdbjl2s5lwa
[02:46:35] <Cork> no
[02:46:45] <Cork> .html() is not valid js
[02:47:02] <Cork> you could use $(this) or you would have to select the element again
[02:48:14] <Cork> php916: https://jsfiddle.net/4s74snyc/
[02:48:16] <php916> $(this).html() then
[02:48:25] <Cork> there is more errors then that
[02:48:56] <php916> Cork like what?
[02:49:01] <Cork> hte jsfiddle
[02:49:16] <Cork> btw, do you have content in the element you want to show before you replace it?
[02:49:22] <Cork> or was that just chaining errors?
[02:50:11] <php916> my elemnt is empty from the start, so if error/message arrive, it fades in, delays and fades out
[02:50:12] <Cork> i just realized as you wrong .delay wrong you might have meant to do $('#frm_result').html('<b>Подождите...</b>').fadeIn().delay(5000).fadeOut()
[02:50:21] <Cork> ya, ok so you don't need the callback
[02:50:33] <Cork> *as you wrote
[02:51:02] <dhs1111> im having trouble with this: http://jsbin.com/niheqekecu/edit?html,css,js,output when i use the clear button the .hover stops being called, how do i fix it?
[02:51:27] <Cork> dhs1111: don't use jsbin it loses changes all the time
[02:51:35] <Cork> (currently it doesn't have your code so can't answer)
[02:51:41] <Cork> use jsfiddle.net
[02:52:04] <Cork> the jsbin only contains "var list= document.getElementsByTagName" right now
[02:52:22] <dhs1111> sry here https://jsfiddle.net/1d62oyr9/
[02:52:57] <Cork> dhs1111: on line 6 you bind the hover event directly to all existing .box elements
[02:53:10] <Cork> on line 15 you replace them, so all event handlers gets removed
[02:53:21] <Cork> (and on line 21)
[02:54:01] <Cork> solution: https://jsfiddle.net/1d62oyr9/1/
[02:54:21] <Cork> that one binds the event handler on the .container and catches bubbling events from .box
[02:54:41] <Cork> so it will catch hover events from all .box elements that exist inside it, no matter when they where added
[02:54:51] <dhs1111> yeah i read about that but that doesnt seem to work at all, when i hover over the div's nothing happens
[02:56:48] <Cork> one min let me tidy this up a bit
[02:58:01] <dhs1111> ok thanks, also when i added a console.log('something') inside the .on function it doesnt get logged in the console
[02:59:23] <Cork> gah, right...
[02:59:28] <Cork> forgot that hover doesn't bubble...
[02:59:37] <dhs1111> bubble?
[02:59:38] <dhs1111> lol
[02:59:46] <php916> Cork, another one: $('#frm_result').html(result).fadeIn().delay(5000)(function(){window.location.reload(true)});
[03:00:07] <php916> Crok, what i'm doing wrong here?
[03:00:10] <php916> cork*
[03:00:11] <Cork> dhs1111: https://jsfiddle.net/1d62oyr9/4/
[03:00:18] <dhs1111> thanks ill try it
[03:00:33] <Cork> php916: you need to learn javascript syntax
[03:00:37] <Cork> that doesn't parse
[03:01:34] <php916> Cork, well, then a can't "daisy-chain" reload
[03:01:43] <php916> i can't*
[03:02:22] <Cork> dhs1111: btw, yes bubble, when an event goes from the source element to the parent it is referred to as bubbling
[03:02:35] <dhs1111> thanks cork, so the reason was that .on doesnt work with .hover inside it? also in the code you gave me have you done $(something).on(something).on(something)? is that possible?
[03:02:54] <Cork> dhs1111: it was multiple problems
[03:03:13] <Cork> dhs1111: firstly you bound the events directly, so when the element got replaced so was the event handler
[03:03:40] <Cork> secondly (my mistake) was that the hover event, for legacy reasons doesn't bubble to the parent
[03:04:05] <Cork> so when i bound the event handler on .container and listend for bubbling events
[03:04:08] <Cork> none came
[03:04:13] <Cork> so nothing worked
[03:04:27] <dhs1111> ah, makes sense now, thanks
[03:04:38] <Cork> php916: you can, but .delay(5000)(function(){window.location.reload(true)}); doesn't parse
[03:05:08] <Cork> php916: .delay(5000).queue(function(){window.location.reload(true)}); does, and might be what you want
[03:06:22] <Cork> dhs1111: also two other comments
[03:06:27] <dhs1111> yea
[03:06:36] <Cork> dhs1111: i would recommend setting a class instead of using background-color in js
[03:06:44] <Cork> makes the code cleaner, and easier to change style later
[03:07:13] <Cork> secondly if the style is all you want to reset you could then do $('.container .highlighted').removeClass('highlighted')
[03:07:21] <Cork> without the need to replace the dom elements
[03:08:00] <dhs1111> yea seems much cleaner, ill try and change it to that now
[03:11:55] <Cork> dhs1111: https://jsfiddle.net/1d62oyr9/6/
[03:12:25] <Cork> dhs1111: i also removed the dom0 event attribute (don't use those), and replaced the append in a loop (really bad performance)
[03:12:38] <dhs1111> dom0?
[03:12:44] <Cork> onclick=""
[03:12:54] <Cork> it is pre web standards solution
[03:13:01] <Cork> and is horrible for a LONG list of reasons
[03:13:13] <dhs1111> so i should always bind a function to a button using jquery?
[03:13:23] <Cork> you can do it with pure js too
[03:13:24] <Cork> but yes
[03:13:58] <Cork> document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', function() {}) == $('button').on('click', function() {})
[03:14:15] <Cork> well actually
[03:14:18] <Cork> document.querySelectorAll('button').addEventListener('click', function() {}) == $('button').on('click', function() {})
[03:15:05] <Cork> dhs1111: keep the html in html and js in js, and css in the stylesheet :)
[03:15:09] <Cork> it makes life much easier
[03:15:13] <dhs1111> lol
[03:17:39] <Uhkis> -1 not enough jquery
[03:17:49] <Cork> lol
[03:21:02] <systemfault> jQuery is like violence, if it doesn't solve your problems, you're not using enough of it.
[03:22:11] <Cork> i seriously hope noone takes that seriously >_>
[03:22:36] <Cork> cause ppl are already too js happy...
[03:23:33] <php916> Cork node.js "happy"*
[03:23:47] <Cork> well that too
[03:23:58] <Uhkis> but nodejs makes me happy
[03:24:08] <Cork> but i meant more like basically writing the entire page in a .js file
[03:24:10] <php916> Ukhis, no it's a lie
[03:24:31] <Cork> all the css and basically all the html wrapped inside the js
[03:24:48] <Cork> and using .hover instead of css :hover and so on
[03:24:49] <php916> Cork, back in my day it was enough to push an .html page with .js script or two
[03:25:08] <Cork> "in my days" huh? :D
[03:25:18] <Cork> well i started before js was a thing ^^'
[03:25:18] <php916> Cork yeah
[03:25:36] <Cork> i remembered the "wow" over onsubmit and document.write :D
[03:26:13] <Cork> "you can actually validate and update the page without waiting for the server??"
[03:26:59] <Cork> hack i started when css only had a handfull of properties
[03:27:04] <php916> Cork then came ruby and ruined everything /not js-related tho/
[03:27:17] <Cork> uh ruby is like 10 years later...
[03:27:30] <Cork> also ruby wasn't the cause of that
[03:27:54] <php916> Cork, technically it was node and stuff like that
[03:27:54] <Uhkis> ruby is that old?
[03:28:11] <Cork> Uhkis: no
[03:28:17] <systemfault> Fairly old
[03:28:24] <php916> 1995
[03:28:25] <Cork> like i said 10 years later...
[03:28:27] <systemfault> Ruby is as old as Java... or JavaScript
[03:28:38] <php916> or maybe python
[03:28:56] <Cork> python is much much older then ruby
[03:28:58] <php916> wait...python is older
[03:29:05] <php916> by 4 years
[03:57:10] <php916> Cork any way to fix shift down while fading in/out? http://pastie.org/private/8xlrsresgjdr00km36ra http://i.imgur.com/5ghG1N6.gifv
[03:57:42] <Cork> php916: use animate and opacity instead of fade
[03:57:54] <Cork> the shifting is cause it sets display: none
[04:03:18] <php916> Cork not really solved the issue http://pastie.org/private/tykrp52fzq9rhdrbuqwxa (only one way(fade))
[04:03:40] <php916> oops, i'm a bit blind
[04:04:27] <php916> Cork second one is 'show'
[04:04:37] <php916> yet the same issue appeared again
[04:04:43] <Cork> its opacity: 0 and opacity: 1
[04:05:02] <Cork> show/hide i think has magic doing the same thing as fade
[04:05:26] <php916> Cork and nooow it works
[04:05:43] <hellyeah> .css("background-color", ""); will remove background color right
[04:07:53] <Cork> no it will remove local style settings from that element
[04:08:02] <Cork> resetting it to what ever the stylesheet sets it to
[04:18:51] <hellyeah> $('something').css(background-color", ""); this is what i do is this wrong?
[04:19:09] <Cork> leading quote
[04:28:40] <hellyeah> Cork:  i see the thing you meantion now
[04:28:41] <hellyeah> thanks
[04:36:25] * sbs hates javascript
[04:39:23] <sbs> does one need to put ; at the end of a JS line? or is it optional? or am I missing something?
[04:39:33] <Success> sbs, it is in most cases optional
[04:40:11] <Success> sbs, the times where you'll probably need it is if the proceeding character is a [ or ( or something like that
[04:40:37] <sbs> when you basically can determin if next line is a new statement or not
[04:41:09] <Cork> it is optional, though it is recommended to always add it
[04:41:20] <Cork> cause else the script will break if you ever run it through a minifyer
[04:41:43] <sbs> is there a proper ide for js programming when the code resides on a server?
[04:42:02] <Cork> you mean so you can edit the file over ftp?
[04:42:08] <sbs> yes
[04:42:14] <Cork> not that i know of
[04:42:25] <Cork> best solution is to edit a local copy
[04:42:32] <sbs> I am using notepad++ which is a great tool, but as an IDE this sucks big time
[04:42:35] <Cork> just run a simple nginx server locally
[04:42:57] <Success> sbs, I'd recommend git + atom
[04:43:11] <sbs> How do you have a local copy, if it mostly runs on a php env with sql
[04:43:15] <Success> sbs, also vim handles ftp editing pretty nicely.
[04:43:34] <Cork> sbs: well mysql can be accessed remotely
[04:43:38] <Success> sbs, slave a local sql install?
[04:43:40] <Cork> and php is easy enough to run locally
[04:44:02] <sbs> I have enough stuff on my laptop without adding more I can avoid actually
[04:44:29] <Cork> well then you can save an html copy of the live page and use that when you edit the js i guess
[04:44:56] <Cork> also btw, php can run as a webserver so you only need the php binary
[04:45:35] <sbs> I find pretty extravagant that no ide support having file on a remote server since it what internet dev is about actually
[04:45:59] <Cork> sbs: well there are, but the problem is it adds A LOT of complexity
[04:46:15] <Cork> as you have to edit it locally (ftp doesn't support remote edit) then upload the change
[04:46:27] <Success> sqlite & php lel
[04:46:27] <Cork> and then reload something on a different url to see the effect
[04:47:09] <Cork> while with a local copy you can just use inotify and auto refresh the browser when you save a file
[04:47:12] <Cork> and done
[04:47:58] <Success> also node.js is the future muahahaha
[04:48:02] <Success> bare metal MEAN staxxx
[04:48:08] <Cork> eh...
[04:48:21] <Cork> i don't agree with that commend at all...
[04:48:36] <Cork> node.js is a hype, not much more then that
[04:48:41] <sbs> var CurEpoch = new Date();
[04:48:41] <sbs> CurEpoch= CurEpoch.getUTCSeconds();
[04:48:41] <sbs>  
[04:48:53] <Cork> it has way to bad performance to take over as a common webserver
[04:48:56] <sbs> Is there a reason this does not work? e
[04:49:00] <sbs> except for being ugly
[04:49:20] <Cork> nope
[04:49:35] <sbs> well it does not :(
[04:49:36] <Cork> CurEpoch should be 16 when you're done
[04:49:45] <sbs> ?? huh
[04:49:51] <Cork> lol
[04:49:56] <Cork> just kidding :)
[04:50:09] <sbs> omfg
[04:50:18] <Cork> if that doesn't work it depends on something outside the lines you pasted
[04:50:23] <Success> sbs, what environment? I don't think internet explorer would like that code
[04:50:25] <sbs> getUTCSeconds is not the opposite of setUTCSeconds
[04:50:30] <Success> sbs, neither will rhino
[04:51:04] <sbs> nvm, I'll have to work the other way around
[04:51:04] <Cork> no ie supports it just fine
[04:51:06] <sbs> :(
[04:51:31] <Success> I don't think it would like the self referencing assignment
[04:51:44] <Cork> no that's fine
[04:51:52] <Success> ie6 even?
[04:51:54] <Cork> ya
[04:51:57] <Cork> ie 4 even
[04:52:00] <sbs> well I did Curpoch = new Date().getUTCSeconds();
[04:52:08] <sbs> but as it did not work I split to understand
[04:52:14] <Cork> Curpoch = (new Date()).getUTCSeconds();
[04:52:19] <Success> the stupid one that if you do a=[1,2,];console.log(a); it outputs [1,2,3]?
[04:52:24] <Cork> you need to wrap the new statement
[04:52:29] <sbs> sparing myself an extra variable declaration. JS allows for uglyniss, ket's enjoy
[04:52:29] <Success> Cork++
[04:53:18] <sbs> does not work, means for me does not return an epoch, it does not crash
[04:53:24] <Cork> Success: what?
[04:53:28] <Cork> in what engine?
[04:53:35] <Cork> jscript would crash
[04:53:38] <Cork> not add a 3
[04:53:57] <sbs> actually in what situation does the UTC seconds deffer from the localtime seconds? that's a pretty useless function
[04:54:10] <Cork> sbs: as far as i know never
[04:54:20] <sbs> thus my point
[04:54:24] <Cork> i suspect it is added for completeness and future security
[04:54:44] <Cork> the spec supports second offset though
[04:54:50] <Cork> (the time zone spec)
[04:54:59] <Cork> so it can technically happen
[04:55:09] <sbs> yeah mytimezone = UTC+42s
[04:55:29] <Cork> i hope noone will ever go there though...
[04:55:35] <Success> well technically
[04:55:43] <Cork> 30 min timezone is way enough for my taste...
[05:35:25] <Kartagis> does Date API convert timestamp to localised date?
[05:35:51] <Kartagis> I mean, Jun in English and Haz in Turkish
[05:44:33] <Cork> Kartagis: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleDateString
[06:53:06] <hellyeah> so it is  either .data('smt') or .prop('data-smt') right
[06:53:17] <hellyeah> ?
[07:17:58] <Cork> hellyeah: the former
[07:18:11] <Cork> .attr('data-smt') is an option if you want to work around the cache
[07:18:23] <Cork> (and the json parser)
[07:24:41] <hellyeah> what do you mean with "work around the cache"? can you explain?
[08:01:52] <konrados> hellyeah: .data function "caches" the result, so if it changes it doesn't know it and returns old information. attr doesn't have this issues.
[08:02:44] <konrados> Cork - is that right^ ? plus what do you mean by working around json parser?
[08:03:08] <Cork> ya, if you use .data you should update it with .data too
[08:03:21] <Cork> .data will detect if the element is replaced, but not if the attribute is updated
[08:03:48] <Cork> what i meant by work around the cache is that if you update with .data the attribute doesn't get updated
[08:04:09] <Cork> and some ppl want the dom attribute to reflect the data (doesn't work with structured data though)
[08:05:03] <konrados> ok, thanks Cork!
[08:42:45] <titi> Anyone have some idea, if the FB pixel code is possible to make as a lazzy download? Give it a a sense?
[08:49:37] <titi> or another better perform?
[09:27:32] <hellyeah> Cork: konrados thanks
[09:27:46] <hellyeah> i still dont get the json parser par tho
[09:41:04] <garethdaine> Hey
[09:42:03] <hellyeah> yo
[09:42:26] <garethdaine> How would I find this tag in a textarea ![Image Name]() where image name could be any string, and the brackets are empty, then find the caret position?
[09:42:45] <garethdaine> The caret position of the empty brackets
[09:43:27] <hellyeah> i dont know
[09:43:31] <hellyeah> fiddle may help
[09:58:27] <Cork> garethdaine: you would have to use regex
[09:58:42] <garethdaine> Yeah, got the RegEx sorted now
[09:59:05] <garethdaine> Doing… /!\[.*\]\(.*\)/g
[09:59:39] <garethdaine> So, I can replace the whole tag
[10:00:08] <garethdaine> I’ll store each tag in an array, and use the index for the replace in the textarea, does that soudn liek a good solution?
[10:00:20] <Cork> not really
[10:00:34] <Cork> i would recommend using regex groups to get the full match
[10:00:50] <Cork> then you can give .replace a function and process each match individually
[10:03:09] <Cork> something like .replace(/!\[(.*)(\]\((.*)\)/g, function(all, name, argument) { return [ '![', name, '](', argument, ')' ].join(''); })
[10:03:19] <Cork> it returns the new modified string
[10:03:44] <Cork> remember that the caret position gets reset if you modify the textarea from js
[10:03:49] <Cork> so store the old position first
[10:04:12] <Cork> (also that is my typing code from my head, so it might be wrong)
[10:04:17] <Cork> *is me
[11:13:06] <Nkwelle> Hello. I need some assistance with some code that has a small bit to do with jquery, but it has more to do with why an integer variable is getting random values.
[11:15:23] <taplar> can you share your code in a jsfiddle or pastie?
[11:17:00] <Nkwelle> http://pastebin.com/2vckk2ia
[11:17:33] <Nkwelle> My jqgrid data is loaded from some internal locations, so I'm not sure if I can get that up.
[11:18:06] <Nkwelle> The output in the else block inside the for loop is correct.
[11:21:08] <sharkman> gentleman easy question for you masters.  how do i jquery select a tag that is <div aria-control="nba-stuff">
[11:21:45] <taplar> $('div').filter('[aria-control="nba-stuff"]')
[11:21:51] <taplar> better to put a class on it though
[11:22:23] <sharkman> why is it better to put a class on it? it seems arbitrary what info about a tag jquery uses
[11:22:40] <taplar> attributes are not meant to be selected upon
[11:22:44] <taplar> id/classes/tags are
[11:22:54] <sharkman> oh i see okay thanks
[11:25:26] <taplar> Nkwelle: nothing it jumping out at me.  someone else might see something
[11:28:58] <taplar> personally though i'd look into changing that to use map() if possible
[11:31:16] <Nkwelle> Changing which?
[11:31:56] * sportman waves
[11:32:13] <sportman> has someone used the jquery serialize array with a form that has some repeatable fields and some non repeatable ?
[11:32:22] <Nkwelle> The big issue is that pos is getting set to some arbitrary value like 7 no matter what.
[11:32:27] <sportman> i feel like fields with the names location[] arent handled how i thought they would be
[11:36:12] <taplar> well pos is being set to whatever the last visible columns ".position" is
[11:38:46] <D-rex> Nkwelle: is there 7 columns in your grid?
[11:39:35] <D-rex> Nkwelle: fiddle that with the grid data
[11:41:43] <titi> Hey all, Is possible to make Facebook Pixel as a lazy loading? What do you think?... I have no sense
[11:41:56] <titi> TY
[11:49:50] <Nkwelle> taplar: pos should be set to the the object's position in the original array when the name in the copy equals the name in the original.
[11:51:30] <Nkwelle> D-rex: You're right. There are 7 columns. For some reason, the hidden column 0 is not being removed from columns.
[11:51:41] <Nkwelle> I'll try and see if I can chef up some data.
[11:57:24] <Nkwelle> D-rex: there are actually 8 columns.
[11:57:40] <Nkwelle> 7 if counting starts at 0.
[12:01:43] <D-rex> are there 7 visible columns?
[12:02:58] <D-rex> line 18 could be your problem
[12:06:23] <Nkwelle> 8 visible, 10 columns total. Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/yNw3C/13641/
[12:07:49] <Nkwelle> Line 20 outputs the correct value, and that is the only place and value that I thought gets assigned to pos.
[12:16:59] <tocka> Hi guys, any ideas/plugins on how I could make a sticky headline like this? :o
[12:17:00] <tocka> http://www.eginstill.com/project/enter-the-loft-amsterdam/
[12:17:13] <tocka> The top of the page it scroll down, and when another one appears they change
[12:17:15] <tocka> :|
[12:17:32] <robertmaxrees> you mean the navigation on the left?>
[12:18:33] <tocka> no no...
[12:18:35] <tocka> one sec
[12:18:48] <tocka> https://www.dropbox.com/s/liu66ddiavg7t0x/Screenshot%202016-05-16%2019.18.46.png?dl=0
[12:18:54] <tocka> The "Loft Val Thorens" bit
[12:19:01] <tocka> When you scroll down it also scrolls down with the page
[12:19:07] <robertmaxrees> position: fixed;
[12:19:13] <tocka> and when another headline appears (If you can call it that) they change
[12:19:33] <robertmaxrees> then you detect where the viewport is and swap out the text.
[12:19:35] <tocka> robertmaxrees yeah, I know how make it stick to the top, the problem is the interchange..
[12:19:44] <robertmaxrees> scroll event listener.
[12:20:01] <tocka> Hmm... But it dont think its based on viewport
[12:20:13] <robertmaxrees> why do you say that?
[12:21:04] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you can just inspect the page - that'll give you clues as to what's going on.
[12:21:43] <tocka> robertmaxrees i tried :)
[12:22:06] <tocka> But got a bit confused.. :| Thought of coming here, thought someone might have done such a thing :o
[12:22:15] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty trivial to do.
[12:22:34] <robertmaxrees> scroll event listener, swap out the contents of a fixed position container based on how far down the page the user has scrolled.
[12:23:29] <tocka> Yeah :D
[12:23:34] <tocka> Thats the way to do it!
[12:23:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:23:45] <tocka> Thank you :D
[12:23:48] <robertmaxrees> why wouldn't you agree with me before?
[12:23:52] <tocka> Dont know..
[12:24:06] <tocka> I didnt make sense
[12:24:10] <tocka> but now it does
[12:24:11] <tocka> :D
[12:24:15] <tocka> Thanks! :)
[12:58:31] <jak2000> hi all
[12:59:57] <robertmaxrees> Hello.
[13:05:01] <jak2000> mmm not add a row on my table: http://jsfiddle.net/h4JXs/4223/
[13:05:06] <jak2000> any advice why?
[13:05:25] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[13:05:52] <robertmaxrees> also: you generally don't need a document ready call in a fiddle.
[13:06:29] <robertmaxrees> and this code isn't doing what you think it is ;)
[13:06:43] <robertmaxrees> you want $('#myTable tbody').append()
[13:09:08] <robertmaxrees> also: it's thead, not theader :)
[13:12:31] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/h4JXs/4234/
[13:12:48] <robertmaxrees> open your console again.
[13:12:55] <robertmaxrees> you have a syntax error.
[13:13:08] <jak2000> opened
[13:13:13] <jak2000> but not undertand why:
[13:13:27] <robertmaxrees> you're missing a closing paren.
[13:13:33] <jak2000> Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
[13:13:57] <robertmaxrees> $('#myTable tbody').append('<tr><td>-100</td><td>' + xfecha + '</td><td>' + wnomprod + '</td><td ALIGN='CENTER'>' + wboton + '</td></tr>');
[13:14:02] <robertmaxrees> invalid code here.
[13:14:05] <robertmaxrees> that's causing it.
[13:14:22] <robertmaxrees> need to use double quotes around center
[13:15:27] <jak2000> ok
[13:16:56] <robertmaxrees> do you see why?
[13:17:43] <jak2000> yes
[13:17:46] <jak2000> now: http://jsfiddle.net/h4JXs/4240/
[13:17:54] <jak2000> i want erase the row (any row added
[13:18:03] <robertmaxrees> okay.  what have you tried?
[13:18:10] <jak2000> see please the fiddle
[13:18:20] <decx> you should know about delegation by now
[13:18:21] <robertmaxrees> do you see why that wouldn't work?
[13:18:31] <robertmaxrees> (decx trying to lead them down taht path :) )
[13:18:45] <decx> that would be appropriate fro a new name
[13:18:46] <jak2000> out document ready i try: $(".borrarRenglon").on("click", function () {
[13:18:52] <decx> but jak2000 should know by now
[13:19:05] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you've asked almost this exact question a few times before.
[13:19:20] <jak2000> yes....
[13:19:25] <robertmaxrees> so why are you lost?
[13:19:28] <decx> you cant assign an event to something that doesnt exist
[13:19:37] <robertmaxrees> read https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events and http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[13:19:41] <jak2000> understand
[13:19:41] <robertmaxrees> bookmark those.
[13:27:14] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: delegated events are out document ready right? and start: $( "#dataTable tbody tr" ).on
[13:27:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:27:29] <robertmaxrees> you probably want them in document ready.
[13:27:32] <robertmaxrees> and actually read the pages.
[13:27:36] <robertmaxrees> don't skip to the examples.
[13:27:40] <decx> you should try and do event listeners in native
[13:27:43] <decx> then you understand
[13:27:44] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise you'll have no idea what's going on.
[13:28:06] <jak2000> ok, continue reading... thanks
[14:10:41] <Freefood> Hi does anyone know how to use scrollTop with body and html being heigh : 100% (Don't think I have a choice I need that)
[14:22:48] <ToApolytoXaos> greetings everyone. is it possible to pass an array inside .when()?
[14:29:20] <jak2000> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/h4JXs/4250/
[14:29:22] <jak2000> its ok?
[14:29:25] <jak2000> need prevent?
[14:42:03] <decx> don't do that jak2000
[14:42:15] <decx> like no.... de-le-ga-tion do you speak it
[14:43:51] <decx> ToApolytoXaos: use apply
[14:43:53] <jak2000> i am doing bad the things?
[14:44:13] <decx> like $.when.apply($,array) iirc
[14:44:34] <ToApolytoXaos> ah OK
[14:44:40] <ToApolytoXaos> let me try that :) cheers decx
[14:44:46] <decx> there's also an operator for that in es6
[14:44:53] <decx> but it's not in any IE
[14:45:04] <decx> $.when(...array)
[14:45:14] <ToApolytoXaos> I will try the first example
[14:45:32] <ToApolytoXaos> also the last demo from this link https://api.jquery.com/contents/ does not work on my PC
[14:46:46] <decx> jak2000: yes you search the whole page for every single button and assign the event to all of them repeatedly, do the thing we tell you do do... delegation
[16:42:41] <robertmaxrees> WELP
[18:01:16] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> hey guys, is there a reason why $( ".droppable" ).not('.ui-selected').droppable would work only the first time when i put it inside the selectable stop function?
[18:01:50] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> it works, but it i re-highlight another set the .not is ignored
[18:02:01] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it break.
[18:03:16] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> ill make a fiddle
[18:25:07] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> i dont know why droppable isnt working in this example, but my code resembles this https://jsfiddle.net/UnfixedSNIPERJ/3gggh6bg/13/
[18:25:28] <robertmaxrees> 'cause you're including jquery twice probably :)
[18:26:02] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> I tried using $(this).droppable('destroy'); in the start function, which works but it disables selectable from firing again for some reason
[18:26:18] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/3gggh6bg/14/
[18:26:22] <robertmaxrees> so this is what you have?
[18:27:00] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> yes
[18:27:16] <robertmaxrees> so how do I replciate the exact bug you've got.
[18:27:53] <robertmaxrees> i select some things and can drag 'em.
[18:28:01] <robertmaxrees> then i select other things and can drag those.
[18:28:22] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> hmmm im trying to replicate it with this fiddle, when selecting a ".droppable" it should disable droppable for that item
[18:28:40] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> which it will do the first time, but if i reselect it will not disable droppable if it has .ui-selected
[18:29:17] <robertmaxrees> isn't that what you want?
[18:30:01] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> anytime .droppable also has .ui-selected it should not allow droppable to happen
[18:30:37] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> which will only work once for some reason, if I deselect and reselect, even if .droppable has .ui-selected it will allow it to be droppable
[18:31:07] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> .not(".ui-selected") seems to only work on the first selected instance
[18:31:56] <robertmaxrees> i guess i'm confused about what you're expecting to happen.  sorry!
[18:33:30] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> its ok, I am making this really difficult! I will tinker around and try to get a better example for you
[18:33:44] <robertmaxrees> why not explain what it is you're actually trying to accomplish?
[18:34:01] <robertmaxrees> you keep saying "it's doing x" but you're not really explaining what it should be doing.
[18:53:58] <Baako> hi guys if i want to add an onclick listner to the "back" button https://jsfiddle.net/jmfy88bc/
[18:54:16] <Baako> the button has no id
[18:54:20] <robertmaxrees> doesn't need one.
[18:54:23] <robertmaxrees> you can use a class.
[18:56:34] <Baako> robertmaxrees, but are classes
[18:56:41] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what that means.
[18:56:53] <robertmaxrees> you can select elements via class.
[18:57:51] <robertmaxrees> do you not know how to select elements via classname?
[18:57:57] <Baako> in the jsfiddle you might have notice it is class="order_btn hand pull_left"
[18:58:03] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:58:08] <robertmaxrees> you can select on those classes.
[18:58:12] <Baako> $('.classname')
[18:58:17] <robertmaxrees> so use that.
[18:58:47] <Baako> robertmaxrees, will it make sure that all those classes exist within the html class tag?
[18:58:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:59:01] <Baako> e.g. $('.order_btn hand pull_left')
[18:59:13] <robertmaxrees> so you have other pull_back elements you don't want to select?
[18:59:15] <Baako> so it makes that that it has class="order_btn hand pull_left"
[18:59:22] <robertmaxrees> why not target via the parent div?
[19:00:02] <Baako> robertmaxrees, what i am trying to do is look within the div id of paybox and looks for an element which has all this classes order_btn hand pull_left
[19:00:19] <robertmaxrees> so then use a multiple class selector.
[19:00:25] <robertmaxrees> .order_btn.pull_left
[19:03:05] <robertmaxrees> does that make sense?
[19:03:27] <Baako> $('.order_btn .hand .pull_left')
[19:03:52] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:03:57] <robertmaxrees> notice how my example didn't have a space?
[19:04:25] <Baako> $(document).on('click', '.order_btn.hand.pull_left', function() will that work like that
[19:04:42] <robertmaxrees> sure, though I'd scope that down further than document.
[19:04:58] <Baako> or will it best to do $('#paybox').on('click', '.order_btn.hand.pull_left', function()
[19:05:08] <robertmaxrees> the second.
[19:13:58] <Baako> robertmaxrees, the issue i am having with that is that because that listner is far ahead of the process that listener doesnt work
[19:14:15] <robertmaxrees> so you're dynamically adding that parent after the page laods?
[19:14:56] <Baako> its a one page app so things get added for each "page"(section) depending on what the user is doing
[19:15:04] <robertmaxrees> that changes things then.
[19:15:20] <Baako> so i need to do (document)
[19:15:26] <Baako> $(document)
[19:15:31] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:33:49] <ajf-> how do I determine if the clicked element is the element I bound the click handler to? if (e.target == ?) ?
[19:33:56] <ajf-> this ?
[19:34:15] <robertmaxrees> you can't use == for that kind of comparison.
[19:34:50] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/event.target/
[19:35:25] <ajf-> ah ok
[20:58:41] <Freefood> I want to make a one step scroll for the first 100% height of my screen after that it becomes normal scrolling. I have managed to kinda do it but If i keep scrolling it cancels my jquery animation any idea on how to fix such behaviour ?
[23:18:31] <jak2000> how to test if a string have a integer value ( a valid integer value) ?
[23:38:55] <Jakey> how would one like get the first input text form in a dom?
[23:42:23] <notchris-work> How do I literally do %2B
[23:42:24] <notchris-work> input.value.replace(/ /g, '%2B');
[23:42:35] <notchris-work> Without it turning to “+"
