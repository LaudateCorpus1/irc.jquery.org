[03:18:23] <teamcoltra> Hey all... I was wondering if I want to select a child div by class how would I do that? like I have $('.class-group').function({ content: $('.class-group-content') )} but I really want content to be something like $(this + '.class-group-content')
[03:23:59] <simulated> $('.class-group-content', this) which might be the same thing as $(this).find('.class-group-content')
[03:24:36] <simulated> or $(this).children('.class-group-content')
[03:33:52] <teamcoltra> simulated well that got me closer, for whatever reason didn't actually grab the content but isn't breaking anymore so I can start from there in the morning. It's probably something dumb due to needing sleep. Thanks for the help :)
[03:43:21] <simulated> no problem.  good luck
[03:44:21] <lenswipee> simulated, you are very talented man :-)
[03:46:45] <simulated> lol thanks
