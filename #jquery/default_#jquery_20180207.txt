[01:01:56] <devi8> anybody had any experience with "sticky headers"?
[01:03:43] <Woet> devi8: just ask your question.
[01:03:43] <Woet> unless you're doing a survey
[01:05:40] <devi8> How do you do them? See, that's why you ask an obtuse question...I"ve been trying it a bunch of different ways and if someone has some experience with it, it would help. When I get to the point that I can ask help with an explicit problem, I will. But right now, it's more of a survey of which way people have done it.
[01:06:23] <Woet> well, googling "jquery sticky headers" gave me several github results of jquery plugins that do it for you
[01:06:36] <Woet> so why don't they work for you?
[01:07:00] <devi8> I have tried a lot of them and can't get them to work...perhaps it's how I have my content laid out.
[01:07:16] <devi8> See a single sticky header is no problem
[01:07:39] <devi8> but in long scrolling content where you want the "current" section header displayed, I'm having difficulties
[01:07:59] <Woet> can you share one of your attempts on jsfiddle?
[01:08:01] <Woet> ah, section header
[01:08:08] <Woet> i know datatables does that but it might be overkill
[01:08:21] <Woet> unless you're not using it for tabular data
[01:08:28] <devi8> Here is the content and I'll show you what I have been trying so far.
[01:08:37] <devi8> https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/YeGKpN
[01:08:57] <devi8> You can see various attempts are commented out.
[01:10:05] <devi8> basically, when the bottom of a section is within the viewport, I want the header to scroll up with it and the next section header to scroll up with the top of the next section
[01:10:24] <devi8> then when it gets to the top, stay there until the bottom shows up and do it again.
[01:11:50] <devi8> and I have all those ridiculous variables called out to track what I am doing better. It'll be much less ridiculous when it works.
[01:38:19] <devi8> omg I did it...
[01:39:18] <devi8> https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/YeGKpN
[01:53:18] <devi8> So close. It works great so long as I don't scroll too fast
[03:31:49] <linurandy> hello to everyone, Does jqueryui menu let me do horizontal menu?
[03:34:43] <linurandy> hello to everyone, Does jqueryui menu let me do horizontal menu?
[03:38:27] <linurandy> This forum is empty?
[03:39:07] <devi8> no, just busy. Did you check the jquery UI menu pages?
[03:39:09] <undefined_bob> no, you just need some patient
[03:39:50] <localh0st> linurandy: let me help you: https://www.google.pl/search?q=jquery+ui+horizontal+menu&oq=jquery+ui+hori&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.4782j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
[03:39:51] <linurandy> sorry, i think that something in my profile was worong
[04:10:10] <bluesoup> hi
[04:10:52] <bluesoup> im trying to just get the text content in a for loop, however its not working.
[04:10:59] <bluesoup> var prodName = $('p.cartItemPrice'); 	for(var i = 0; i < prodName.length; i++) { 		console.log(prodName[i]); 	}
[04:11:48] <devi8> bluesoup, where do you assign what prodName is?
[04:11:53] <devi8> sry
[04:12:08] <devi8> I mean that's not how you get the values from prodName;
[04:12:23] <bluesoup> sorry i know i meant to add the code through jsfiddle
[04:12:24] <devi8> console.log(propName.eq(i).text();
[04:13:09] <devi8> prodName.eq(i) gives you the paragraph wrapped in jquery...
[04:13:13] <bluesoup> what does the eq mean?
[04:13:19] <devi8> equals
[04:13:25] <devi8> I guess
[04:13:27] <bluesoup> that worked perfectly!
[04:13:37] <bluesoup> thank you so much @devi8
[04:13:40] <devi8> np
[04:48:32] <fas3r> hello, is there a shorter way to do for this short function : https://pastebin.com/yrqp8Si2 .   thanks.
[04:50:53] <Cork> i would prob just do var settings = { targetName..., data: $.extend({}, (options.data || {}), { mandatory: '' }) };
[04:51:06] <Cork> if someone sends option.data = true
[04:51:14] <Cork> well... that's there problem
[04:51:32] <Cork> ah, sorry i missed you merge all of it
[04:51:53] <fas3r> Cork: thanks for looking at it.
[04:52:15] <Cork> so  var settings = $.extend(true, {}, options, { targetName..., data: { mandatory: '' } });
[04:52:24] <Cork> fas3r: ^
[04:52:34] <Cork> the true as the first argument means deep extend
[04:52:40] <Cork> so it handles data
[04:52:54] <fas3r> Cork: ok, I was about to ask you.
[04:53:06] <fas3r> thank you :)
[04:53:08] <Cork> np
[04:53:30] <fas3r> it's prettier than checking the type and the lenght :D
[04:53:35] <Cork> :)
[04:56:08] <fas3r> Cork: is it fine to call my function with $.fn.funcName() instead of funcName() ?
[04:56:18] <Cork> no
[04:56:27] <Cork> if you don't want it binded on an element add it on $
[04:56:34] <Cork> so $.funcName = function() {}
[04:57:05] <Cork> $.fn.funcName should always be used as $().funcName()
[04:57:38] <fas3r> oki, the .fn. means that it expect an object ?
[04:57:50] <Cork> it expects an element
[04:57:53] <fas3r> oki
[04:58:29] <Cork> $.fn.myFunc = function() { this.each(function() { /* loop the matched elements */ }) }
[04:58:34] <fas3r> can I do $.extend({ myFunc: function() {}     }) ?
[04:58:40] <Cork> sure
[04:58:45] <fas3r> oki
[04:58:54] <fas3r> Cork: thanks for the clarification
[04:59:11] <Cork> hmm actually...
[04:59:17] <Cork> not sure if $.extend extends $
[04:59:20] * Cork checks
[04:59:23] <Cork> i know $.fn.extend does
[04:59:56] <Cork> actaully it can't possibly do, it would be mad
[05:00:03] <fas3r> :D
[05:00:05] <Cork> fas3r: you have to use $.extend($, {})
[05:00:27] <fas3r> oki
[05:01:38] <fas3r> so something like :    (function($) {       $.extend($, {myFunc: function() {}    })   }( jQuery));
[05:01:50] <Cork> yup
[05:02:07] <fas3r> thanks :)
[05:02:08] <Cork> if you just have one function i would prob write it as $.myFunc though
[05:02:23] <Cork> also be careful with what functions you add to $
[05:02:34] <fas3r> the name ?
[05:02:38] <Cork> it can be messy if you add all functions you create to it
[05:02:56] <Cork> just add helper functions to it and (ex window.app = {} for nine helper functions)
[05:03:05] <Cork> nine==none
[05:03:20] <Cork> to keep the webpage features off the jquery object
[05:03:34] <fas3r> I'm not sure to understand
[05:03:34] <Cork> not a requirement, but a recommendation
[05:04:11] <Cork> something like $.displaySignupDialog() should be app.displaySignupDialog()
[05:04:24] <Cork> as it isn't a helper function but more a website feature
[05:04:42] <Cork> but that is more of a recommendation to make the site easier to manage
[05:05:22] <Cork> what one pushes onto $ should be more like $.formatCSV or something like that
[05:05:29] <Cork> meaning a generic helper
[05:06:38] <fas3r> ok, I got it
[05:12:01] <fas3r> Cork: I think it's fine then, most of the function that I do so far are related to basic functionality which I declare directly in the button in the onClick() attribute. As some are used on several page I tought it would be easier.
[05:12:22] <fas3r> that's why in this case I wanted to give 1 or 2 attributes as optional.
[05:12:22] <Cork> fas3r: don't use event attributes
[05:12:27] <Cork> use event listeners
[05:12:37] <fas3r> Cork: I meant in the HTML
[05:12:41] <Cork> ya
[05:13:06] <Cork> event attributes is a legacy feature browsers has to support for compatibility with 20+ years old webpages
[05:13:07] <fas3r> Cork: you mean .on('click', function() {}) ?
[05:13:12] <Cork> yes
[05:13:25] <Cork> it has bad interaction with event handling and makes a mess of things
[05:13:31] <Cork> (event attributes i mean)
[05:13:39] <fas3r> ok.
[05:13:48] <Cork> you can't have more then one per element for example
[05:13:59] <Cork> they don't fire in the same order as event handlers
[05:14:08] <Cork> is evaled when they run
[05:14:13] <Cork> don't have scope
[05:14:15] <Cork> and so on
[05:14:55] <fas3r> I was not planning to add others listener on it beside the one in onClick(). I will change then.
[05:25:07] <treepalm> hi all, I need some help with a simple Form I’m building, I’ve already created a form on Bootstrap in HTML, and I’ve already set up Express on app.js (server side) what I wanna achieve is that once the form is completed a POST request is sent to the server and I can display a JSON with all the information set inside the Form, how can I do that with jQuery???
[05:25:46] <treepalm> Because right now I’ve build a script that catches the info from the Form and creates a JSON, but I’ve problems implementing it with the server side….
[05:26:21] <Cork> treepalm: bind a submit event on the form and $(this).serialize() then post that (don't forget event.preventDefault())
[05:26:55] <treepalm> is there a good guide about that? Becuase I’ve quite new to jQuery..
[05:27:12] <Cork> i suspect it exists in learn.jquery.com
[05:27:32] <Cork> treepalm: http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/ajax-and-forms/
[05:28:05] <treepalm> Cork: thanks, I’ll start looking at that
[05:28:20] <Cork> can recommend going through the rest of that site too
[05:30:40] <treepalm> but that’s all about the client side.. what about the server side and the implementation with Express? That’s actually my main issue
[05:31:22] <Cork> treepalm: that you would have to ask in a channel related to the server software you have
[05:32:02] <Cork> the only thing special for json response is that you _should_ have the "Content-Type: application/json" header
[05:32:15] <treepalm> I mean the server side of the web.. using Node and Express
[05:32:25] <Cork> else you will have to hack around it client side
[05:32:37] <Cork> treepalm: ya, that is what i talked about
[05:32:52] <Cork> so ex. => #node.js
[05:32:53] <treepalm> okeoke
[07:16:11] <fas3r> Cork: following what you told me regarding " window.app = {  myfunc: function() { ... }  } " to declare my features, If I declare window.app more than once in different js files, does the contain of window.app will get overrided ?
[07:17:17] <Cork> sure
[07:17:27] <Cork> just use $.extend(window.app, {})
[07:17:46] <fas3r> ... ok I wanted to ask you if I can extend it :D
[07:17:48] <fas3r> thanks :D
[07:28:41] <fas3r> Cork: sorry you raise my curiosity, as I have to put (function(window, $) {   window.app = { } }(window, jQuery)); .      Can I also put my $(document).ready(function() { }) in this function too ?
[07:29:17] <Cork> inside what function?
[07:29:40] <Cork> you can, but it has to be executed on page load, or it won't do anything
[07:29:41] <fas3r> I mean inside (function(window, $) { }(window, jQuery));
[07:29:45] <Cork> sure
[07:29:53] <Cork> that is just a scope
[07:30:01] <Cork> (a self executing anonymous function)
[07:30:13] <fas3r> ho ok.
[07:30:39] <Cork> all it does it prevent all variables you define inside it to be globals
[07:31:28] <fas3r> oki
[07:35:04] <devi8> var anchs=$("a.current"); to get all of the parent ("li") elements of anchs, do I have to do anchs.each() or is there a better way?
[07:35:24] <Cork> anchs.closest('li')
[07:35:40] <devi8> will give all lthe lis or just the first anch's li
[07:36:10] <Cork> it will walk the parentNode tree for each element in the set
[07:36:27] <devi8> that rocks. thanks
[07:38:48] <fas3r> untilParent() also, no ?
[07:39:24] <Cork> it grabs all parents until it
[07:39:27] <Cork> so no, not the same thing
[07:39:58] <Cork> i also don't think it works on more then one element; as it returns multiple elements per element you run it on
[07:50:05] <darxmurf> hi all
[07:52:52] <darxmurf> I'm trying to understand the concept of .push and .when.done to wait the end of a .each launching POST
[07:53:07] <darxmurf> but I'm still getting the same result :-/
[07:53:28] <darxmurf> here is my simple piece of code: http://paste.debian.net/1009181/
[07:53:52] <darxmurf> many thanks if you have a bit of time to explain me this ?
[07:54:32] <Cork> darxmurf: $.when() waits for all the calls to be complete before it exits
[07:54:57] <darxmurf> it's what I need yep but it's not waiting
[07:54:59] <Cork> without it you would have to check that each ajax call has completed and then collect the results
[07:55:17] <Cork> what do you mean "not waiting"?
[07:55:43] <darxmurf> in my stuff I get the content of all the <div> from the page and create a PDF for each. This works well
[07:55:58] <darxmurf> then I want, when all the PDF are done, to launch another function
[07:56:32] <Cork> one min
[07:56:37] <darxmurf> but in my code, as soon as I click on my button, I see the console.log()
[07:56:49] <darxmurf> then I can see the PDF still arriving in my folder
[07:56:53] <Cork> ah, wait you use $.when(arr) that is the wrong syntax
[07:57:07] <Cork> its $.when(arg1, arg2, arg3)
[07:57:21] <Cork> or $.when.apply(null, arr)
[07:57:37] <darxmurf> well but I only have one arg
[07:57:43] <darxmurf> "tasklist"
[07:57:50] <Cork> ya, but $.when doesn't take an array
[07:57:55] <Cork> it takes deferred objects
[07:57:59] <darxmurf> ha !
[07:59:34] <darxmurf> damn
[07:59:38] <darxmurf> it works
[07:59:42] <darxmurf> thanks sir !
[07:59:44] <Cork> :)
[08:00:07] <darxmurf> fook it you can find 1000 codes on the web and nothing is clear :-/
[08:03:55] <Cork> darxmurf: api.jquery.com is a really good resource
[08:19:48] <fas3r> is it a problem to do a $.get on a js file to load it dynamically ?
[08:20:50] <Cork> fas3r: you would get it as a string, not as "code"
[08:21:18] <Cork> $.getScript will eval it automatically, but it won't work if you have eval prevention through csp
[08:22:13] <fas3r> Cork: ok so it's a bad idea :D
[08:27:32] <Cork> fas3r: depends on if you need to secure the page for xss
[08:27:39] <Cork> if you do then ya, it is a really bad idea
[08:29:49] <fas3r> Cork: how can I do if I want to load a page which require additional js without exposing it first ?    for example page 1 -> ajax  -> page 2 ( like dynamic )
[08:30:15] <Cork> fas3r: you can create a script tag and inject it in the page
[08:30:39] <Cork> then you can bind a load event on it to know when the script has loaded
[08:30:51] <Cork> that will let the browser parse the script without having to eval
[08:31:13] <Cork> (and the csp url filter works like normal so it is happy too)
[08:32:49] <fas3r> load() would not do it if I return pure HTML ?
[08:34:02] <Cork> it would
[08:34:22] <Cork> though jquery has had weird eval code in its html parser
[08:34:30] <Cork> let me make sure it isn't still doing that
[08:34:44] <fas3r> Cork: that's really kind from you.
[08:36:25] <Cork> damn ya it does
[08:37:32] <fas3r> where did you find the info if I may ask >
[08:37:33] <fas3r> ?
[08:38:07] <Cork> https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.js
[08:38:10] <Cork> reading the code
[08:38:12] <Cork> :)
[08:38:28] <Cork> trying to figure out what source file it is in so i can link it
[08:41:30] <Cork> ah, there it is
[08:41:45] <Cork> fas3r: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L191
[08:42:05] <Cork> so jquery will regex grab script tags in the html and eval the scripts if it finds them :/
[09:00:56] <TiffanyAmber> What would be a good way to check for a specific div#element visibility? (with performance in mind). I'm using if($("div#overlay").is(':hidden')) {  but I've read that might be an issue for some browsers (especially mobile)
[09:03:40] <Cork> TiffanyAmber: firstly don't use element tag type with id selectors
[09:04:06] <Cork> it is utterly pointless and makes the selector heavier to run (though browser cache the results so it is normally not visible)
[09:04:08] <TiffanyAmber> I screwed up with that one?
[09:04:20] <Cork> $("div#overlay") => $("#overlay")
[09:04:32] <Cork> you can't be more specific then an id, so no point in having div
[09:04:53] <TiffanyAmber> all right, done, just took them all out
[09:05:23] <Cork> for the rest i would prob add a class instead of fiddeling with display
[09:05:28] <TiffanyAmber> it isn't a large code, but I want to squeeze every ms
[09:05:31] <Cork> then you can just check if the class exists on the element
[09:05:51] <Cork> cause :hidden does NOT account for scroll position
[09:05:53] <TiffanyAmber> mmmm good idea
[09:06:17] <TiffanyAmber> its on a navbar at the top anyway, but I see what you mean
[09:06:38] <Cork> then you can do something like $('#overlay.visible').length > 0
[09:06:59] <Cork> or even if(document.querySelector('#overlay.visible'))
[09:07:41] <Cork> doesn't become much more direct then that :D
[09:08:46] <TiffanyAmber> XD thannnnks!
[09:09:05] <TiffanyAmber> I'm using .hide() .show() at the moment, to show and hide the div
[09:09:19] <TiffanyAmber> that is why I was checking against :hidden
[09:11:28] <Cork> toggleClass('visible', true/false)
[09:11:33] <Cork> recommended :)
[09:11:49] <Cork> i use that almost excludively instead of show/hide
[09:12:14] <Cork> (though i usually use a state instead of "visible")
[09:20:22] <fas3r> Cork: what about http://w3bits.com/async-javascript/ ? ( last method )
[09:21:42] <Cork> fas3r: that is the append script i was talking about
[09:22:04] <Cork> but ya, the point was you have to be careful with jquery as it mocks around with script elements
[09:23:35] <fas3r> Cork: what about pure JS ?
[09:23:45] <fas3r> without using the jquery lib.
[09:23:56] <Cork> well if you have the lib or not doesn't matter
[09:24:05] <Cork> just don't use the .html() method
[09:24:28] <Cork> well actually any of the jquery dom modification methods >_>
[09:24:48] <Cork> (.append(), .prepend(), .html(), .appendTo()...)
[09:25:12] <Cork> so $('head')[0].appendChild(script) should be safe
[09:25:55] <fas3r> ok, if not I would do a new XMLHttpRequest(); then request.open('GET',..... etc etc)
[09:31:05] <TiffanyAmber> thanks for your help
[09:32:09] <TiffanyAmber> :_D
[10:55:10] <armlesshobo> when does the function passed into jqXHR.fail() get called? I understand it's for when there is an error, but what constitutes an error?
[10:57:54] <shoky> armlesshobo: could be a http response code error (e.g. 400, 404, 500) or a client issue e.g. the browser is blocking a cross-domain request, or could be a response parse error, e.g. invalid json
[11:01:03] <armlesshobo> ok great. thank you
[11:02:04] <sharks> Hey all, I'm trying to iterate event functions on a newly created <script> tag jQuery("<script>").on("load", function() {console.log('test');})
[11:02:13] <sharks> I'd like to get the onload function object
[11:02:33] <sharks> I've tried using .data("events") but it's returning undefined
[11:05:36] <shoky> sharks: $._data(DOMElement, 'events')  will get it. DOMElement needs to be the raw dom element, not jquery obj. and this is not a documented/supported api
[11:08:49] <sharks> shoky: Perfect, thanks.
[11:09:01] <sharks> shoky: worked.
[15:24:59] <Tak_> Am I missing something here? Why can't I pass this value through? https://bpaste.net/show/c0178b81703d
[15:26:20] <taplar_> can you clarify your question?
[15:27:07] <Tak_> I'm trying to grab a value off a clicked input, then pass it through to my next function. Whenever I pass it through it changes the value to ƒ (a,b){return new e.fn.init(a,b,h)}
[15:27:36] <taplar_> you are not calling the second method
[15:27:48] <taplar_> that second method is being passed into $() and is being executed as a document ready
[15:28:03] <taplar_> the first parameter being jQuery
[15:29:12] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/gw5utqby/
[15:32:25] <Tak_> If I set my var then call weee.fn.jquery, I'm still getting the same return – see here: https://jsfiddle.net/gw5utqby/1/
[15:32:51] <taplar_> they are not the same thing
[15:33:13] <taplar_> just because you have a variable named 'x' doesn't mean it will be passed in on every method that has 'x' as a parameter name
[15:33:19] <taplar_> there is no connection between the two
[15:33:36] <Tak_> But its still not able to return the original value, in my first example, I'm trying to pass the value, which is a string
[15:33:41] <taplar_> if you want to pass in a variable to a method, you must call that method directly and pass it in
[15:34:31] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/gw5utqby/2/
[15:38:32] <Tak_> I can't seem to pass it in though either eventRender: function(event, eventElement, cb_click) { });
[15:38:54] <taplar_> this that fullcalendar thing?
[15:39:36] <Tak_> what's fullcalendar?
[15:39:40] <taplar_> because like i just said, just because you have a variable named the same thing as a function parameter, doesn't mean that's what is passed in
[15:39:51] <taplar_> the value will be what ever the caller passes in
[15:40:38] <taplar_> some guy was asking about fullcallendar yesterday and it had a eventRender or renderEvent or something on it, so I thought you might have been him
[15:41:10] <Tak_> Nope, just what I named the function :s
[16:26:10] <z1haze> how to select the first div in an element? $('.date-picker > div:first-child') no good
[16:26:35] <taplar_> is the div a direct child?
[16:26:47] <z1haze> its a direct child of .date-picker
[16:27:00] <taplar_> then that should do it i believe
[16:27:05] <z1haze> and its the first instance of a div
[16:27:40] <z1haze> its like <div class="date-picker"><h2>blah</h2><div><div>....more of <div></div> that i dont want to select
[16:27:54] <taplar_> that's not the first child then
[16:27:56] <taplar_> h2 is
[16:28:05] <z1haze> so i need first-of-type?
[16:28:11] <taplar_> you want nth-of-type(0) or (1), i forget if it's 0 offset or not
[18:17:20] <devi8> if I have two jquery objects and want to know if a third object exists inside of either of the first two, should i do var isInside=$obj3.is($(obj1).add(obj2));
[18:17:52] <devi8> or is there a better way?
[18:18:15] <taplar_> you can filter
[18:18:54] <taplar_> should be able to do obj1.add(obj2).filter(obj3).length
[18:19:24] <devi8> right on. thanks.
[18:58:51] <devi8> can you break out of a $.fn.each() loop?
[18:59:59] <devi8> return false? really? trying it.
[22:54:39] <Sal> hi
[22:55:26] <Sal> is there a way to select an element inside a previous query?
[22:56:35] <Sal> i mean, i need to work with single <li> and instead of making manu queries like $("ul li[data-id='13']")
[22:57:06] <Sal> i loaded all the <li> doing a $('ul')
[22:57:29] <Sal> and now how can i get from the returning array the <li> with data-id="13" ?
[22:57:45] <Sal> or do i only have to do it using find() ?
[22:57:50] <Sal> on the parent
[23:44:49] <devi8> thanks for all the help here. I'm finally making some progress: https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/zRoyYz
[23:45:13] <devi8> going to sleep now, thanks again.
