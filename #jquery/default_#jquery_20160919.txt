[02:51:37] <alaing> good morning
[02:53:23] <al_nz1> Could someone give me a bit of feedback on this code : http://pastebin.com/ayHJMGj3 ? It hides the Iwi input and label based on the selection in a previous box being "Maori" and this works, but as you can see from the code I have commented out it looks like the listener could be done with the single jquery line "$("#iwi.selectpicker").change(function() {" instead of what I have?
[02:56:07] <al_nz1> this seems simpler : http://pastebin.com/FvABrqsD
[02:56:44] <al_nz1>  but can the label and the picker be hidden in the one statement
[03:18:41] <chipyy> hey
[03:18:58] <chipyy> i would like to ask some stuff about google recaptcha
[03:20:14] <chipyy> could somebody explains me what does it mean callback function?
[03:21:19] <systemfault> It's a function that you pass as an argument to another one... that will eventually be called by the function you passed it in
[03:22:11] <chipyy> i dont understand :)
[03:23:13] <chipyy> so what could i pass with google recaptcha and why should i use or not?
[03:24:18] <systemfault> I have no idea... Do you know what function?
[03:24:39] <chipyy> i am reading documentation and i am trying to understand how does it work
[03:26:08] <chipyy> https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/display
[03:26:23] <systemfault> Ok, what part don't you get?
[03:27:13] <chipyy> topic: Explicitly render the reCAPTCHA widget
[03:27:24] <chipyy> and there is callback function
[03:27:57] <systemfault> chipyy: It means that you declare that function at the top level and recaptcha will call it once it's loaded
[03:28:40] <systemfault> That function can be named whatever you want as long as you pass the name to the script tag
[03:28:54] <chipyy> so recaptcha will load when the whole page is loaded?
[03:29:51] <systemfault> No, recaptcha start loading when your browser parse the recaptcha <script> tag... and ends its loaded by calling the callback function you declared
[03:30:20] <systemfault> Before that callback, you cannot use any of the recaptcha functions because they're not loaded (They don't exist at that point)
[03:30:29] <chipyy> aha
[03:30:52] <chipyy> ok, so should i use this for registration and contact forms?
[03:31:29] <chipyy> or where could i use this callback , for what opportunities?
[03:32:07] <systemfault> You only need it if you need to interact with the API explicitely.
[03:32:27] <systemfault> If you want to make the captcha appear under some conditions... or if you want to reset it...
[03:32:32] <systemfault> etc..
[03:32:43] <chipyy> aaaa, ok that i would like to knoe
[03:32:47] <chipyy> know*
[03:33:02] <chipyy> ok lets go to next question, here are options to modify
[03:33:27] <chipyy> could you help me and tell me where could i add this attributes?
[03:34:04] <chipyy> because now i have only div with this id and script tag for google recaptcha
[03:35:24] <chipyy> systemfault: its written that api.js configuration, but atm i have script connected to web i dont have my own js file, so how should i configurate?
[03:39:58] <chipyy> systemfault: i found answer to my question, i will try to fix it by myself
[03:40:14] <chipyy> i need to make callback function for modifications
[03:47:22] <chipyy> but it doesnt work :(
[03:52:52] <chipyy> could somebody help me with this: http://pastebin.com/PBLyFfeq it doesnt show recaptcha
[03:54:08] <chipyy> i changed the key now :D
[03:58:40] <chipyy> any help ?
[03:59:05] <chipyy> i am following this: https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/display#render_param
[04:07:27] <jerit> chipyy <div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="..."></div> should be all you need in your form
[04:07:43] <jerit> specifically note the div class
[04:08:00] <chipyy> i had this before yes.. but i would like to modigy google recaptcha
[04:08:06] <chipyy> to theme: dark light
[04:08:12] <chipyy> and mybe to try with pictures
[04:08:50] <chipyy> that what i paste to pastebin it doesn work...
[04:09:07] <chipyy> its simply doesnt show recaptcha window
[04:11:26] <jerit> chipyy so <div class="g-recaptcha" data-theme="dark" data.sitekey="..."></div>
[04:12:09] <chipyy> that also works?
[04:12:16] <chipyy> ok i will try right now :)
[04:16:44] <chipyy> ok it works, tnx. i am trying to add: data-type="audio image" but it doesnt work
[04:17:02] <chipyy> ups, forget :)
[04:18:15] <chipyy> data-type="audio" doesnt work.. :D
[04:22:39] <chipyy> jerit: google recaptcha is better to check on server side, rather then on client right?
[04:32:20] <jerit> chipyy yes, server side is better
[04:33:42] <jerit> on my form I set up the secret as a constant and posted it to the siteverify with the response from the form
[04:37:46] <chipyy> jerit: you do with ajax and php or how? and could you send me or paste some code how to check?
[04:53:15] <jerit> chipyy this posts it to my Controller (I use C#) http://pastebin.com/HnzrRY0F
[04:53:18] <dminuoso> Hi. If I trigger a .collapse('hide') during the transformation of another .collapse('show') (or the other way around), the second collapse does not seem to get queued at times.
[04:53:23] <dminuoso> Oh wait! Wrong channel. :-)
[04:53:54] <jerit> chipyy I don't think I can help you with the php though
[05:22:02] <chipyy>  jerit: tnx anyway for your help ;)
[05:37:02] <xenaxon> hi all !!
[05:37:18] <xenaxon> I am making an ajax POST form
[05:37:41] <xenaxon> and I'm triggering the request on click of the "send" send button
[05:37:50] <xenaxon> I tried to implement google recapcha
[05:37:59] <xenaxon> but how can I implement it in my case
[05:38:14] <xenaxon> how do I make my jquery function recognise the status of the recapcha
[05:45:17] <jerit> xenaxon just post to the siteverify with your recaptcha secret and response, then if that validates, post to your database
[05:45:18] <jerit> http://pastebin.com/zJsLtT7u
[05:47:02] <jerit> has to be said though, posting the recaptcha this way probably isn't the best idea

[09:17:43] <nindustries> Hi, suppose I have the following code that checks for a page update every minute with setInterval, does this need async in the AJAX request or not?
[09:18:26] <nindustries> I suppose I have to set async:false, so it never fires multiple times?
[09:46:10] <agnitio_> I’m trying to concatenate a string and send it as a param in a URL. However my ‘&’ is being converted to ‘%26’ and therefore sending a malformed URL. How do I stop this? https://jsfiddle.net/y1z3dr05/
[09:47:49] <jak2000> hi all
[09:52:44] <AdamPDotty> agnitio_: have a look at encodeURI() or escape()
[09:53:20] <agnitio_> AdamPDotty Thanks, I’ll give it a try.
[09:54:22] <shoky> agnitio_: make a fiddle that shows it happening. that would happen e.g. if you call encodeURIComponent on a string that has & in it. and then the solution would be to not call it on that string ;)
[10:20:21] <Duikb00t> someone a solution, data-src seems not to be working on Safari..
[10:20:27] <Duikb00t> so it's not loading my lazy images
[10:38:29] <Aljone> i wonder, there is a way to know if an element have specific font assigned to it or just the general one?
[10:39:58] <taplar> $(element).css('fontFamily'); ?
[10:41:36] <Aljone> but it seems if i go for all dom eleement on a loop and do element.css("font-size") it will giev me font-size even if that specific element dont have a specific class that show its size
[10:42:05] <taplar> it may be getting the computed value.  *shrug*
[10:42:19] <taplar> so your interested in only if it has an inline style?
[11:31:39] <anli_> How do I open the downloads page in chrome?
[11:32:26] <taplar> with js?
[11:33:35] <anli_> no, with the gui :)
[11:33:43] <anli_> I cant find it any longer
[11:34:07] <anli_> Ah, about:downloads
[11:36:44] <arc_> ctrl+j, menu > downloads

[12:10:16] <BulleTTime> hey there
[12:10:29] <BulleTTime> working on a project that uses ajax
[12:10:50] <BulleTTime> it was working a few days, suddenly i get:
[12:10:50] <BulleTTime> Refused to execute script from 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwmqG55tt2d2FcT_WQ3WjCSKmtyFpkOcdpr…ago.nl&callback=jQuery1124036349124577256253_1474301401056&_=1474301401057' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.
[12:11:34] <BulleTTime> anyone knows what this is? its comming from my live update while i not changed anything
[12:25:10] <zanzibar_> Hi, when I click a button, I want the text I pasted in a text box to automatically scroll down at a set speed. How would I go about doing this?
[12:26:19] <robertmaxrees> animate the scrolltop?
[12:27:00] <zanzibar_> robertmaxrees yes I found a fiddle that uses scrollTop. But it scrolls in a jerky fashion. Is there a way to make it more smooth? http://jsfiddle.net/mrobin/52jzM/1/
[12:27:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah, use jquery's animate.
[12:28:34] <zanzibar_> robertmaxrees you mean .animate instead of setInterval?
[12:28:43] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[12:28:50] <robertmaxrees> yopu'd rip out pretty much all of that code.
[12:32:40] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[12:35:16] <zanzibar_> robertmaxrees I think so. I updated the fiddle but for some reason nothing happens when I click on my div: http://jsfiddle.net/52jzM/2467/
[12:35:35] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[12:35:37] <robertmaxrees> what do you see?
[12:35:49] <robertmaxrees> and you don't want div.scrollTop(pos + 2);.
[12:35:49] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[12:36:12] <robertmaxrees> also, var div = $('div'); is going to grab all divs on the page.
[12:36:50] <zanzibar_> robertmaxrees oh weird, sorry didn't see that . looks like it's scrolling now
[12:37:04] <robertmaxrees> also: you're using the wrong animation properties for scrolling.
[12:38:02] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1ovkk20c/
[12:38:08] <robertmaxrees> you want something like this instead.
[12:38:34] <zanzibar_> robertmaxrees yes that's what I was going for. Thanks I hadn't used animate before.
[12:38:43] <robertmaxrees> the docs are pretty awesome.
[12:39:01] <zanzibar_> yeah

[13:13:59] <robertmaxrees> you can't repeat an ID on the page.
[13:14:06] <robertmaxrees> you can with classes.
[13:14:52] <robertmaxrees> second off: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/phb6jxev/1/ this is all you need for this fiddle.

[13:20:08] <d[10]> click on input origem
[13:20:11] <robertmaxrees> right now, you can't actually select it.
[13:20:13] <robertmaxrees> so fix that first.
[13:20:16] <robertmaxrees> you can't repeat IDs.
[13:20:31] <d[10]> i know it
[13:20:34] <robertmaxrees> then fix it.
[13:20:37] <d[10]> see

[13:21:16] <robertmaxrees> it's not hard.
[13:22:24] <fugue> Hi there, I'm a newbie to jquery and web stuff so I apologize in advance for silly questions. I'm currently trying to create alerts based on a radio button selection. I'm using document.getElementById to get the value of radio button. I have a danger and success alert. Is there anyway I can change these types based on the input?
[13:22:50] <fugue> If I create 2 div alerts, they end up stacking on each other
[13:22:59] <robertmaxrees> fugue sure.  have a jsfiddle?
[13:23:13] <fugue> Let me create one, one sec please.
[13:23:17] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:23:53] <fugue> https://jsfiddle.net/cgjqvbnm/
[13:24:44] <robertmaxrees> so my first question: why not use jquery for selecting by id?
[13:26:30] <fugue> robertmaxrees: would that be considered "DOM manipulation"
[13:26:39] <robertmaxrees> errr, what?
[13:26:54] <robertmaxrees> you're already using jquery to select the button by ID.
[13:27:00] <robertmaxrees> $('#btn') - why not use that same pattern elsewhere?
[13:27:27] <fugue> Can you show me an example?
[13:27:34] <robertmaxrees> ... you're already doing it?
[13:27:36] <robertmaxrees> really confused lol.
[13:27:44] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cgjqvbnm/3/
[13:27:45] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[13:27:46] <fugue> Yeah I am... hah
[13:27:54] <robertmaxrees> like, you're already using jquery to select via ID.
[13:28:14] <robertmaxrees> so just use jquery instead of sprinkling in a mixture of raw dom and jquery accessors.
[13:28:32] <Dan39> can i not register click for an element that is not yet in the dom? like $('#myDiv').click(...) but myDiv will not be introduced until an ajax request runs?
[13:28:38] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: probably because you can't access that checked property straight up like that ;)
[13:28:41] <GodGinrai> So, I am using getScript to call a script from a url which has a 301 redirect, and the getScript call is failing, even tho' the network tab shows the file being called.  Anyone know why?
[13:28:44] <robertmaxrees> Dan39 nope.  you cna use a delegated selector instead.
[13:28:53] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis that's the next bit ;)
[13:28:55] <Dan39> thanks
[13:29:08] <robertmaxrees> fugue you'd then use .prop('checked')
[13:29:27] <Dan39> may be a better way to do this i feel
[13:29:29] <Dan39> hmm
[13:29:32] <robertmaxrees> Dan39 do what?
[13:29:40] <Dan39> im thinking :p 1 second
[13:29:53] <robertmaxrees> Dan39 delegated event listeners are the "better way"
[13:30:06] <Dan39> ok
[13:30:24] <robertmaxrees> fugue https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cgjqvbnm/7/
[13:30:42] <robertmaxrees> GodGinrai valid response format?
[13:30:57] <Dan39> i have a table of users that i get username/email/id from ajax request, id like to make the tr's clickable to be able to then run a button click for the selected row
[13:31:14] <robertmaxrees> Dan39 yeah, delegated event listener.
[13:31:23] <robertmaxrees> you'd just bind your listener to the <tr>
[13:31:28] <Dan39> right
[13:31:44] <robertmaxrees> in fact, just bind all the logic to the tr - why worry about the button at that point?
[13:31:57] <Dan39> there will be different buttons
[13:32:06] <Dan39> like lock user, delete user
[13:32:18] <robertmaxrees> so then you bind different delegated listeners for each button.
[13:32:21] <GodGinrai> robertmaxrees: yes, the response format is valid
[13:32:27] <Dan39> sounds good
[13:32:29] <robertmaxrees> GodGinrai that's all i can think of.
[13:32:34] <GodGinrai> :\
[13:32:35] <robertmaxrees> GodGinrai without seeing it, no clue.
[13:32:41] <Dan39> and yes ive read up tons about using tables or not in the new html/css world :P
[13:32:51] <robertmaxrees> Dan39 tables are fine if you have tabular data.
[13:33:01] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you do ;) just don't expect them to be super flexible.
[13:33:08] <Dan39> it is tabular id say, but i may want to style it different than this
[13:33:12] <fugue> Hm, this is still not changing the alert type
[13:33:17] <Dan39> so maybe in future ill change it haha
[13:33:24] <robertmaxrees> fugue show me what you've got.
[13:33:33] <fugue> sec
[13:33:35] <robertmaxrees> and clarify "changing the alert type"
[13:34:45] <fugue> https://jsfiddle.net/cgjqvbnm/8/
[13:35:00] <robertmaxrees> don't include the script tags in fiddle btw.
[13:35:08] <fugue> Oh, sorry
[13:35:22] <robertmaxrees> also you weren't including jquery :) https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cgjqvbnm/9/
[13:35:31] <robertmaxrees> so what's supposed to happen here?
[13:36:16] <fugue> Alright, so if you have footbal selected, alert-success alert shows up. If you choose any of the other options, an alert-danger (should) show up, in the same exact location
[13:36:37] <robertmaxrees> it's exactly what you'd think it is.
[13:37:05] <fugue> But why are the answers stacking ontop of each other
[13:37:17] <fugue> Is there a way to make them "in place" of each other
[13:37:18] <robertmaxrees> because you're not hiding the invalid one.
[13:37:27] <robertmaxrees> you have to manually show/hide them.
[13:37:51] <fugue> So you would create two, ideally
[13:37:54] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:38:10] <Dan39> ah ha it works! very simple
[13:38:13] <fugue> Notice have I have alert_fail and alert_answer div
[13:38:21] <fugue> You are saying I should pull out alert_fail
[13:38:24] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:38:28] <robertmaxrees> you're overcomplicating it lol
[13:38:30] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[13:38:48] <Dan39> i have users div in static html at start which contains the table, so just did $("#users").on("click", "tr", function() {...});
[13:39:28] <mllie> Hello guys
[13:39:43] <Dan39> hello mllie
[13:40:20] <mllie> I'm using jquery validate and unobtrusive validation. When I try to do $('form').delegate('*', 'submit', function (event) { ... }); that is not called when pressing submit button
[13:40:23] <mllie> Any idea why+
[13:40:23] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cgjqvbnm/12/ fugue
[13:40:42] <robertmaxrees> mllie what version of jquery are you using?
[13:40:48] <mllie> robertmaxrees: 1.12
[13:40:52] <robertmaxrees> use .on()
[13:40:56] <robertmaxrees> not .delegate()
[13:41:00] <robertmaxrees> and actually.
[13:41:12] <robertmaxrees> no need to delegate at all unless the form is created after pageload.
[13:41:33] <mllie> robertmaxrees: it could be created after pageload, that's why I delegate
[13:41:50] <fugue> robertmaxrees: wow
[13:41:52] <Dan39> grrr these are the annoying parts... using <input type="submit"> vs <button> WHICH ONE!!!??
[13:41:52] <mllie> robertmaxrees: This script is used together with jquery 1.6 as well, sorry missed to tell you
[13:41:57] <fugue> So display block display none
[13:42:02] <mllie> robertmaxrees: that's why I'm using delegate
[13:42:03] <robertmaxrees> mllie then bind to a parent element - $('someParent').on('submit', 'form', function() {});
[13:42:08] <robertmaxrees> mllie errr, woah.
[13:42:25] <taplar> Dan39: huh?
[13:42:31] <robertmaxrees> mllie you're going to have a helluva time fixing that.
[13:42:35] <robertmaxrees> fugue yeah.
[13:42:39] <fugue> I think thats what I was missing
[13:42:40] <Dan39> taplar: dfiferent ways of making a button...
[13:42:45] <robertmaxrees> Dan39 use button.
[13:42:46] <taplar> sure
[13:42:48] <fugue> robertmaxrees: cheers
[13:42:55] <robertmaxrees> fugue def
[13:42:57] <taplar> cause <input> is generic
[13:43:03] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:43:06] <mllie> robertmaxrees: Well, I don't think the delegate is the problem actually, is it?
[13:43:46] <robertmaxrees> mllie something about the way you're using it looks wrong.
[13:43:49] <robertmaxrees> but maybe I'm wrong.
[13:43:56] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it fail.
[13:43:59] <taplar> millie delegates me be bound to a pre-existing parent
[13:44:06] <taplar> not the element itself
[13:44:11] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you don't want children of form, you want the form.
[13:44:52] <mllie> robertmaxrees: there is no error, it's just not executed
[13:44:56] <mllie> taplar: How do you mean?
[13:45:04] <taplar> that's what a delegate is
[13:45:09] <taplar> it listens for events from children
[13:45:09] <robertmaxrees> mllie then yeah, you're binging to the wrong element.
[13:45:24] <taplar> the binding is put on the parent element
[13:45:30] <taplar> if that element doesn't exist, no dice
[13:45:33] <Dan39> hmm
[13:45:47] <Dan39> now should i worry about making all of these buttons work without javascript... ugh
[13:46:13] <mllie> robertmaxrees, taplar: I see. But on is not working like that?
[13:46:17] <mllie> .on()
[13:46:21] <taplar> on works the same way
[13:46:26] <taplar> though the params are flipped iirc
[13:46:44] <taplar> on(event, filter, handler)
[13:46:49] <taplar> vs (filter, event, hander) for bind
[13:46:54] <taplar> err delegate
[13:48:11] <mllie> taplar: So then I would like to bind to body I guess?
[13:48:21] <d10magic> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/WGGyxW why no return text of div ?
[13:48:24] <taplar> whatever the closest parent is that pre-exists
[13:48:30] <taplar> you want to bind as low as possible
[13:48:37] <mllie> taplar: that's body
[13:48:44] <taplar> so, sure
[13:49:04] <mllie> taplar: I guess that's the normal conversion from live to on?
[13:49:24] <mllie> taplar: Selectors work inside the on-method as well?
[13:49:27] <taplar> i'm not familiar with live, personally
[13:49:30] <taplar> yes
[13:49:45] <zanzibar_> is it possible to scroll a textbox with scroll bottom instead of scroll top? I'm noticing that if I'm at the bottom of a textarea, it will spend the duration on scrolling back to the top. But if I'm at the top of the textarea, it will scroll down too slowly.
[13:50:22] <mllie> taplar: gonna try it out now
[13:50:33] <robertmaxrees> zanzibar_ huh?
[13:51:37] <taplar> d10magic: i don't see an element with id dddorigem
[13:52:09] <robertmaxrees> d10magic your html is still invalid.
[13:52:10] <robertmaxrees> fix it.
[13:52:22] <taplar> hah
[13:52:38] <zanzibar_> robertmaxrees in your fiddle, try entering very long text into your text box. When you're at the bottom of the text, notice how clicking the button causes it to scroll up through the entire text for as long as the duration is set?
[13:52:40] <zanzibar_> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1ovkk20c/
[13:52:49] <d10magic> robertmaxrees
[13:52:49] <d10magic> stop being annoying
[13:52:53] <d10magic> -.-
[13:53:00] <taplar> it's not annoying it's accurate
[13:53:08] <zanzibar_> here, I'll set it up for you
[13:53:09] <robertmaxrees> uh, we can't fix your stuff if your html is invalid.
[13:53:11] <taplar> your using ids like classes, and classes like ids
[13:53:15] <robertmaxrees> zanzibar_ there's no textarea in there.
[13:53:18] <taplar> but id's can't be duplicated
[13:53:26] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^ just like i said earlier.
[13:54:34] <zanzibar_> robertmaxrees ok I'll update it and show you
[13:55:28] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[14:02:21] <zanzibar_> robertmaxrees ok it's not showing the same behavior as before. What I want is to scroll through the entire text for as long as a duration. So, if the duration is set to 1000, then I want it to scroll to the bottom in one second: https://jsfiddle.net/1ovkk20c/4/
[14:03:21] <robertmaxrees> right...
[14:03:38] <mllie> robertmaxrees, taplar: Now it works like expected. Thanks alot for you superspeedy help :D
[14:03:55] <mllie> robertmaxrees, taplar: That's exactly how you like it when you ask something (y)
[14:04:02] <zanzibar_> robertmaxrees do you know how I can alter the scroll speed to fit the duration?
[14:04:45] <robertmaxrees> zanzibar_ it should scroll the whole height in the duration.
[14:04:51] <robertmaxrees> duration IS speed.
[14:05:03] <robertmaxrees> so you've got something unusual going on with your textarea.
[14:05:08] <zanzibar_> robertmaxrees the behavior I'm getting is that it's only scrolling for as long as the duration.
[14:05:17] <robertmaxrees> right, which is what it should do.
[14:05:21] <robertmaxrees> but it should scroll the whole height.
[14:05:33] <zanzibar_> I see
[14:07:59] <robertmaxrees> it's because you're grabbing the wrong height fwiw.
[14:08:16] <zanzibar_> robertmaxrees which is the correct height?
[14:08:24] <robertmaxrees> you want the scrollheight
[14:08:53] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1ovkk20c/11/
[14:09:24] <zanzibar_> robertmaxrees OK thanks
[14:11:08] <joaocastanho> hi
[14:11:38] <joaocastanho> how can you do a redirect location that will work for both localhost and domain ?
[14:12:05] <robertmaxrees> joaocastanho window.location = window.location.domain + '/somePathHere'
[14:12:28] <robertmaxrees> or even just window.location = '/somePathHere'
[14:12:46] <joaocastanho> but locally I have it in folder/folder
[14:12:50] <joaocastanho> localhost/folder/folder
[14:12:59] <robertmaxrees> you can grab window.location.pathname to get the current path.
[14:14:21] <joaocastanho> okay, close but the user is in localhost/folder/folder/somepage
[14:14:30] <joaocastanho> I want to redirect to localhost/folder/folder
[14:14:44] <robertmaxrees> then do window.location = /folder/folder
[14:14:46] <robertmaxrees> should work fine.
[14:14:59] <joaocastanho> but then in domain name wont work
[14:15:01] <joaocastanho> right?
[14:15:04] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:15:05] <joaocastanho> I wont have those folders
[14:15:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:15:16] <robertmaxrees> so it's totally different?
[14:15:20] <joaocastanho> yep
[14:15:31] <robertmaxrees> then you're sol and need to manually detect.
[14:15:47] <joaocastanho> how?
[14:16:13] <robertmaxrees> you can use .indexOf() - if (window.location.indexOf('localhost') > -1)
[14:16:23] <joaocastanho> ah
[14:18:30] <joaocastanho> thanks robertmaxrees ;)
[14:49:31] <papadong> Hi guys, i have a stupid question about CSS
[14:51:44] <merkazu> suppose I did this, $(document).trigger('promo-event'), would there be a way to see what function triggered this particular event?
[14:52:20] <taplar> merkazu: i don't think so
[14:52:21] <nitrospectide> If someone clicks div.itemA div.sub1, I want div.itemB div.sub1 to highlight. How do I do this? http://jsbin.com/buxefihili/edit?html,js,output
[14:52:31] <taplar> papadong: there is a ##css room
[14:53:02] <merkazu> the reason why i'm asking is that there may be multiple sources of this promo-event event but i don't want to throw an error in the console if the function that handles promo events isn't included for some reason (robustness)
[14:54:03] <taplar> you should get an error in your console if that happens, i would think, which should probably have a stack trace or something on it that you can click to go to the source
[15:03:31] <linux_daemon> hey guys, i am working with datatables, here is the pastebin. no matter where i put the script src, i get: jquery.dataTables.min.js:5 Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[15:03:39] <linux_daemon> jquery.dataTables.min.js:5 Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not definedhttp://pastebin.com/hL6LtFYc
[15:04:04] <papadong> http://jsfiddle.net/6ELSF/895/ Hi guys, how can i change the opacity of an image on the hover from 0.5 to 1. It's work from 1 to 0.5 but not from 0.5 to 1. How can i fix it ? i have to use jquery ans .css() function ?
[15:06:36] <taplar> papadong: your not setting the opacity of 1 on the img
[15:06:46] <taplar> css selectors are different
[15:07:02] <taplar> again, ##css
[15:11:35] <zanzibar_> When I enter input into a textarea, it shows me the text at the far bottom of the scroll. How can I automatically have it go back to the top?
[15:15:04] <zanzibar_> setting scrollTop(0) doesn't put scroll back at top for some reason.
[15:17:10] <zanzibar_> For example, if you cut and paste the text in this textarea, it stays at the bottom of the scroll: https://jsfiddle.net/1ovkk20c/14/
[15:25:13] <taplar> zanzibar_: check your console
[17:04:47] <egp> is there any way to get jquery ui to have the datepicker to append the div to another div and not just the body? it's screwing with some of my css coverrides...dialogue has a .appendTo(0
[17:08:36] <Dan39> iwth jquery-ui, does it have to use the included jquery from external? does that conflict with my regular jquery? i see it is a much older version of jquery... kind of confusing.
[17:09:12] <egp> n.datepicker._mainDivId).length === 0 && n("body").append(n.datepicker.dpDiv); - @#@$*()@# guess not
[17:13:40] <Dan39> beep boop
[17:14:01] <chipyy> hey, i have little problem with ajax response. in ajax i have few ifs which checks php file if he echo "success" , "wrongpassword" etc.
[17:14:13] <chipyy> problem is that works only "success"
[17:14:50] <Dan39> looks like i got my answer
[17:14:58] <Dan39> now how do i have both living together happily... haha
[17:15:21] <Dan39> jquery-ui does not work 100% with jquery 3.1.0
[17:15:29] <Dan39> " "
[17:15:32] <Dan39> is what i read
[17:15:44] <Dan39> wish i knew this earlier
[17:19:12] <chipyy> here is code: http://pastebin.com/t0g4RhWK
[17:19:29] <chipyy> if i enter wrong username or password always alerts me "crkni"
[17:19:49] <chipyy> but if i enter password and username correct then its ok
[17:20:07] <taplar> what is the response on the request?
[17:21:21] <chipyy> if the password and username is correct php echo success and it sends me to other site
[17:22:28] <chipyy> but if i enter username which doesnt exist it alerts me "crkni", but the code should alert "niuporabnika"  <-- echo "nouser";
[17:22:51] <chipyy> i realy dont get it why its not working
[17:23:00] <Dan39> anyone know off-hand if jquery-ui Dialog works fine with jquery 3.1.0?
[17:23:26] <taplar> chipyy: look at your network tab in your developer tools at the request.  verify what is being returned when you have the error
[17:23:45] <taplar> you can also console.log(data) to see exactly what it is
[17:24:20] <chipyy> i am not familiar with this tolls
[17:24:36] <taplar> you in chrome or ff?
[17:24:39] <chipyy> where can i add this console.log(data)
[17:24:41] <chipyy> chrome
[17:24:53] <taplar> hit F12 to open your developer tools
[17:24:58] <taplar> then find the "Network" tab
[17:25:39] <taplar> when you have that open, perform the action that will cause the ajax to run and you will see it in there
[17:25:51] <taplar> you can then click it to examine it for things, including the response
[17:26:20] <taplar> as far as where to add the console.log, you can add it any where.  you should use it instead of alert like you are
[17:27:36] <chipyy> ok i opened network tab and performed action
[17:27:47] <chipyy> it shows me only login.php
[17:28:10] <chipyy> and if i click on it shows me this: nouserTa uporabnik ne obstaja!
[17:28:16] <chipyy> so it should work right?
[17:28:29] <taplar> make sure you have either "All" or "XHR" selected in the filter bar area
[17:28:36] <taplar> you should see your ajax request
[17:28:42] <chipyy> i have all yes
[17:28:51] <taplar> and you see the request, or no?
[17:29:33] <chipyy> yes this is latest request: wrongpasswordNapačni podatki!
[17:29:47] <taplar> ok, look at the response of it
[17:30:06] <Dan39> ugh so sad
[17:30:11] <taplar> if you click it, on the right side you should see a few tabs, one of which is "Response"
[17:30:25] <chipyy> yes, this is response taplar: wrongpasswordNapačni podatki!
[17:30:33] <taplar> so there ya go
[17:30:56] <chipyy> yes but in chrome it alerts me "crkni" but it should alert "Napačni podatki!"
[17:30:59] <taplar> "something" !== "somethingaaaaaaaa"
[17:31:14] <taplar> they are not equal
[17:31:43] <chipyy> else if (data=="wrongpassword")
[17:31:45] <taplar> you have "Napačni podatki!" trailing it that makes it false
[17:31:51] <taplar> dude, equality is just that
[17:31:55] <taplar> they must match
[17:32:07] <chipyy> i dont get it
[17:32:16] <taplar> 3 == 4 false, ya?
[17:32:20] <chipyy> i call echo with php....
[17:32:34] <chipyy> and ajax get this echo in response
[17:32:36] <taplar> "a" == "b" is false, ya?
[17:32:41] <chipyy> yes :D
[17:32:45] <Dan39> waaaiiit
[17:32:46] <taplar> so why would "a" =="aNapačni podatki!" be true?
[17:32:48] <Dan39> wait a minute... :D
[17:33:00] <evilbug> do u even troll?
[17:33:12] <Dan39> september 15... jQuery UI 1.12 officially supports jQuery 1.7.0 – 3.1.0.
[17:33:17] <Dan39> thank you god
[17:33:35] <Dan39> guess i hit it lucky
[17:34:04] <Dan39> will see how it works i guess. why do they still include jquery 1.7 with it though...
[17:34:56] <chipyy> wait, so i should delete die(napačni podatki) and then should be ok right?
[17:35:15] <taplar> do you understand why it is false?
[17:35:41] <taplar> not what is causing it to be false, but why those two things are not equal
[17:35:41] <chipyy> yes
[17:35:44] <taplar> k
[17:35:50] <chipyy> because of DIE
[17:35:51] <taplar> so yeah, fix your response
[17:36:12] <chipyy> i didnt know that will die function screw up this
[17:53:58] <Dan39> no one must test themes on anything smaller than 1080p anymore... -_-
[19:06:48] <robertmaxrees> NOT EVERYBODY AT ONCE JEEEEZE.
[19:08:47] <pcfreak30> Can anyone explain why $('<div><label>Hide Delegated:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</label></div>', {class: 'hide_delegated'}) does not add the class attribute?
[19:09:37] <andrew9183> doesnt’ that select in the context of hide_delegated ?
[19:09:47] <andrew9183> thought i havent done jquery in 2 years
[19:10:51] <pcfreak30> huh? mno. its building a jq object from a fragment
[19:11:09] <robertmaxrees> which version of jquery?
[19:11:30] <pcfreak30> 3.1.0
[19:11:53] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[19:16:06] <robertmaxrees> iirc you can't set props like that.
[19:16:22] <pcfreak30> -_-
[19:16:47] <robertmaxrees> there were some limitations with it at least
[19:16:54] <pcfreak30> So $('<div><label>Hide Delegated:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</label></div>').addClass('hide_delegated')?
[19:17:08] <robertmaxrees> you can do
[19:17:09] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/hxz88v1d/1/
[19:17:19] <robertmaxrees> but at that point why not just use a templating engine?
[19:18:04] <pcfreak30> eh template engine is way overkill as this is the only one on the page like it
[19:18:15] <robertmaxrees> then just to simple string concat and call it a day.
[19:18:23] <robertmaxrees> the object syntax is way awkward anyway.
[19:18:37] <pcfreak30> i prefer to use object prepresentation over string building
[19:18:50] <pcfreak30> representation
[19:19:06] <robertmaxrees> sure, but cases like this show exactly where it falls short.
[19:19:07] <robertmaxrees> :)\
[19:19:24] <robertmaxrees> plus if you've already got underscore in your project, you've got a templating engine.
[19:19:41] <pcfreak30> yea i do
[19:19:47] <pcfreak30> but never use it before
[19:19:47] <robertmaxrees> then there you go.
[19:19:50] <robertmaxrees> _.template()
[19:19:53] <robertmaxrees> it's easy.
[19:43:09] <inex> why
[19:43:10] <inex> oh god
[19:43:17] <taplar> ?
[19:43:21] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[19:43:24] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[19:44:27] <robertmaxrees> i asked him why he joined and then quit.
[19:44:31] <robertmaxrees> he said "because 544 is 544 more jquery-lovers than i can handle"
[19:44:38] <taplar> :s
[19:44:42] <robertmaxrees> welp
[19:45:18] <taplar> lol, you mean room members?
[19:45:28] <arc_> ya that's what he meant
[19:45:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:46:10] <taplar> :(, makes me think of the dude who developed git talking about people wanting the ability to delete branches
[19:46:18] <taplar> or history, something
[19:46:25] <robertmaxrees> you mean linus?
[19:46:32] <taplar> probably him
[19:46:35] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[19:46:36] <robertmaxrees> that guy
[19:46:50] <taplar> i'm not a name dropper, :D
[19:46:58] <robertmaxrees> pffff
[19:47:27] <taplar> actually i don't think it was him.  it was like two guys at a conference
[19:47:42] <taplar> essentially talking about how developers have a fear of looking stupid
[19:48:07] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[19:48:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah.

[22:24:49] <fugue> Anyone know why document.getElementById("currentTeam").innerHTML = "Hello World"; keeps changing back to original value?
[22:24:58] <fugue> <p id="currentTeam">NY Giants</p>
[22:34:00] <systemfault> FLeiXiuS: No
[22:34:19] <systemfault> fugue: You probably have some JS running that is changing it back.
[22:36:07] <fugue> systemfault: do you know how I can get the text from this box: <input class="form-control" id="newTeamID" type="text">
[22:36:17] <fugue> and use it to set .innerHTML equal to
[22:36:31] <fugue> tried     var $newTeam = $('#newTeamID'); and     var $newTeam = $('#newTeamID').val();
[22:37:12] <systemfault> fugue: $('#newTeamID').val() should return the value.
[22:38:03] <fugue> systemfault: Aye. In which scenario would you wrap it around a form?
[22:38:15] <fugue> That piece was throwing it all off
[22:38:23] <systemfault> Wrap what?
[22:38:35] <fugue> For example my textbox + button. I had it inside <form>
[22:39:09] <systemfault> If it's a form... the use a <form>, I don't understand
[22:39:20] <fugue> Yeah but when is it a form?
[22:39:27] <fugue> Which scenario would you use it
[22:39:51] <RottenCore> ahoy
