[08:33:12] <Rockwood> anymore way to do something like this https://jsfiddle.net/bnwcz482/ ?
[08:39:57] <Cork> Rockwood: as you've done it, what is the real question?
[08:43:18] <Cork> if the question is how to do it in a more efficient way i would do it something like https://jsfiddle.net/bnwcz482/4/
[08:44:35] <Rockwood> anymore way to replace div bcz in this case i need to write same code twice Cork
[08:44:49] <Cork> check the /4/
[08:44:52] <Rockwood> i need div s
[08:45:06] <Cork> why?
[08:45:30] <Rockwood> its my requirement for project
[08:45:43] <Cork> requirement to use <div> instead of <span>??
[08:45:52] <Rockwood> yes
[08:46:26] <Rockwood> other things looks fine to just in div
[08:48:30] <Rockwood> is possible in div ?
[08:51:04] <Cork> span and divs are just dom elements without any meaning, so ya
[08:54:48] * AdamPDotty imagines a severely depressed div that just learned it has no meaning.
[08:56:05] <Cork> no meaning != no purpose
[08:57:20] <undefined_bob> my work has no meaning and no purpose and is very boring because I have nothing to do
[08:57:49] <Cork> ouch time to change job then
[08:58:18] <undefined_bob> ya even tho the payment is not too bad. but I feel so boreout
[08:59:00] <undefined_bob> I mean, I spend most of my time reading papers about topics I like but it still feels like wasted time
[11:58:06] <khobo> anyone awake?
[11:58:26] <preference> o/
[11:58:37] <preference> i have 2 mins and i'm bad at jquery though
[11:59:19] <khobo> lol
[11:59:33] <khobo> i gotta setup the JS fiddle
[12:01:05] <khobo> https://jsfiddle.net/vdyra30m/1/
[12:01:14] <khobo> how do i add the jquery library
[12:01:17] <khobo> into jsfiddle
[12:01:43] <khobo> i had this guy helping me but he kidna fucked up my code
[12:02:04] <preference> bottom left, click on where it says javascript with no library or w/e and then change the framework to jquery
[12:03:00] <khobo> all i see is resources
[12:03:08] <khobo> aysnc requests
[12:03:10] <preference> uhh, i mean where you put your javascript code
[12:03:13] <khobo> and other (links0
[12:03:18] <khobo> oooo
[12:03:40] <khobo> 3.3.1?
[12:03:46] <preference> that'll do
[12:03:54] <khobo> https://jsfiddle.net/vdyra30m/4/
[12:04:02] <khobo> so like i think im close..
[12:04:07] <khobo> the problem is this thing activates
[12:04:10] <khobo> at full width
[12:04:22] <khobo> i only want it to hide/show when it hits 700px width on response
[12:04:33] <khobo> it seems to hide my nav at all times
[12:04:58] <preference> familiar with media queries in css?
[12:05:03] <khobo> yeah
[12:05:09] <khobo> i know zero jquery
[12:05:13] <khobo> but decent with css/html
[12:05:31] <khobo> i did most of everything else on the site
[12:05:35] <khobo> except for this jquery
[12:05:39] <khobo> all i wantis a pushdown nav
[12:05:44] <khobo> for mobile
[12:05:50] <khobo> and not have to use two <navs>
[12:06:02] <khobo> just a restyle of the nav i have now
[12:06:23] <khobo> also it hides my header which is fucked
[12:06:31] <khobo> he fixed it by putting it outside the nav
[12:06:35] <khobo> but since the nav is fixed
[12:06:40] <khobo> it gets hidden and the flow gets fucked up
[12:06:57] <preference> i will query you some links that may help
[12:07:31] <khobo> he told me i was really close
[12:07:35] <khobo> but needed to use addclasses
[12:07:36] <khobo> and toggle class
[12:07:38] <khobo> functions
[12:07:41] <khobo> to get it 100%
[12:40:08] <robertmaxrees> weeee
[13:22:37] <SomeT> On lines 173, 184 and 194 I am trying to call the function of loadGenres() again so it loads the next movie but does not refresh the entire page, how can  I achieve this because when I use location.reload this refreshes the entire page causing variables to reload which is what I do NOT want.
[13:23:43] <SomeT> Except for the movie name and genre variables that is.
[13:23:53] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:24:01] <robertmaxrees> you want the page to reload, but you don't?
[13:24:04] <taplar> did you share your fiddle?
[13:24:11] <robertmaxrees> also ^
[13:24:28] <SomeT> do I need a fiddle ofr this...
[13:24:33] <SomeT> its pain to setup a fiddle
[13:24:36] <robertmaxrees> err
[13:24:39] <SomeT> but I will do it
[13:24:41] <taplar> well, you mentioned line numbers
[13:24:44] <robertmaxrees> you reference line numbers
[13:24:46] <taplar> lol
[13:24:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:24:58] <robertmaxrees> even just sharing the code would be helpful./
[13:25:20] <SomeT> opps
[13:25:22] <SomeT> I missed
[13:25:27] <SomeT> https://hastebin.com/ijavevader.html
[13:25:27] <WALL-E> SomeT: In order to help you better, please demonstrate your issue with a minimal amount of code here: http://jsfiddle.net/boilerplate/jquery - replace the HTML/CSS/JavaScript with your test case, click "Fork" at the left top and share the URL here.
[13:25:31] <SomeT> I will make a fiddle as well
[13:25:45] <robertmaxrees> is WALL-E a bot?
[13:25:50] <taplar> no clue
[13:25:52] <robertmaxrees> yikes
[13:26:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:26:45] <taplar> reminds me of some of the comments people on S.O. have saved off for fast replies to low quality questions though
[13:26:47] <robertmaxrees> SomeT the three lines you mention up above are empty in that paste.
[13:27:38] <SomeT> yes
[13:27:43] <SomeT> thats wehat I am trying to work out
[13:27:48] <SomeT> the code I need to put there
[13:27:51] <SomeT> still working on the fiddle
[13:28:00] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:28:11] <robertmaxrees> look at how you use that function now.
[13:28:26] <SomeT> I have
[13:28:34] <SomeT> I written the code a few weeks ago
[13:28:36] <robertmaxrees> var genres = await loadGenres()
[13:28:38] <SomeT> so probably missing something
[13:28:53] <robertmaxrees> wait wut
[13:29:14] <SomeT> I dunno
[13:29:29] <SomeT> I mean writing var genres = await loadGenres() can't trigger it again surely?
[13:29:49] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[13:29:56] <robertmaxrees> you're cal;ling the function again.
[13:30:19] <robertmaxrees> though I don't think you're actually using the return from that method.
[13:31:13] <taplar> ln 122
[13:31:20] <SomeT> ok here is the fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/bnxwrutv/3/
[13:31:46] <SomeT> I am so lost
[13:31:53] <SomeT> usually I just call the function
[13:32:02] <SomeT> but I think because there is a delay of sorts due to genre
[13:32:06] <SomeT> its not that simple in this case
[13:32:45] <robertmaxrees> this is some spaghetti code.
[13:33:49] <SomeT> :(
[13:34:03] <SomeT> I admit it is yes lol
[13:34:18] <robertmaxrees> looks like a lot of copy/paste to get it to work.
[13:34:52] <SomeT> yes kinda
[13:34:57] <SomeT> I worked on several versions of it
[13:35:02] <SomeT> until I had one that I was happy with
[13:35:03] <SomeT> lol
[13:35:05] <SomeT> how to call a function from async in javascript?
[13:35:12] <SomeT> I think thats the question I should be asking right?
[13:38:07] <taplar> you can call any method at any time
[13:38:28] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:39:16] <jenny23> hello
[13:39:33] <jenny23> i get an element with querySelector
[13:39:42] <jenny23> how can i get the next one?
[13:39:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:40:00] <jenny23> i tried to use querySelector multple times and i always get the same result
[13:40:05] <robertmaxrees> querySelecter only gets one element.
[13:40:13] <jenny23> is there something like querySelector.next?
[13:40:20] <robertmaxrees> if you have questions about native JS functions, I would go to ##javascript :)
[13:40:24] <SomeT> which method?
[13:40:25] <jenny23> oh ok :D
[13:40:26] <taplar> querySelectorAll(...)[1]
[13:40:32] <SomeT> could you please be more specific taplar?
[13:40:47] <jenny23> i cant use querySelectorAll because the order is important
[13:40:49] <taplar> querySelectorAll behaves just like querySelector, but it returns all elements that match
[13:40:50] <jenny23> but thanks
[13:40:57] <jenny23> @taplar
[13:41:08] <taplar> and the order they are returned will be the order they are in the dom
[13:41:31] <jenny23> i have to know if some string occures before or after another
[13:41:44] <jenny23> so if i use the "all" method i cant do this
[13:42:05] <taplar> element [1] is always after element [0]
[13:43:04] <jenny23> but the selctor is different
[13:43:25] <taplar> ?
[13:43:56] <jenny23> <user> <user> <user> <user> <middle> <user> <user> <user> <user>
[13:44:05] <SomeT> @taplar what did you mean in relation to my code, how and what method should and could I call to resolve my issue please?
[13:44:14] <jenny23> i have to check if a specific user occures after or before
[13:44:25] <jenny23> middle
[13:44:47] <taplar> jenny23: ok, i'd have to see an actual example of your issue then to advise more
[13:45:14] <jenny23> ok
[13:45:23] <taplar> SomeT: my comment was meant as it was said.  A function can be called at any time you can perform a javascript statement
[13:45:37] <taplar> (a)sync simply changes how you handle the responses
[13:46:38] <taplar> which if you are using the await keyword, those differences are reduces, iirc
[13:46:46] <taplar> r/reduces/reduced/
[13:47:28] <SomeT> but when I call my function on the click
[13:47:30] <SomeT> nothing happens
[13:47:33] <SomeT> no errors etc...
[13:47:46] <SomeT> so I thought it was the fact I used async above the clicks that were causing the issue?
[13:48:31] <taplar> the request doesn't happen again?
[13:48:46] <taplar> you don't see it in your network console?
[13:48:50] <SomeT> nope
[13:49:23] <taplar> can you update that hastebin to show what you changed?
[13:52:39] <SomeT> one sec
[14:00:39] <SomeT> https://hastebin.com/ajijisekoj.html
[14:01:48] <taplar> and if you open your network console, and then have one of those methods execute, you don't see the network request happen?
[14:02:34] <SomeT> one serc
[14:02:37] <SomeT> I will double check
[14:03:50] <SomeT> when I click nothing on the DOM / page changes
[14:03:57] <SomeT> I think I need to clear #feed first?
[14:04:00] <taplar> that's not what i'm asking, :)
[14:04:00] <SomeT> somehow
[14:04:03] <SomeT> so lost
[14:04:26] <taplar> your loadGenres() method -only- does an ajax request
[14:04:32] <taplar> it does not change anything on the page
[14:05:39] <SomeT> ah
[14:05:40] <SomeT> ...
[14:05:42] <SomeT> one sec
[14:06:10] <SomeT> but in that function
[14:06:16] <SomeT> should it not trigger: $('#feed').append(item); at some point?
[14:06:42] <taplar> what do you mean?
[14:06:59] <taplar> $('#feed').append(item); is on line 134
[14:07:16] <taplar> which is inside a different method
[14:07:52] <robertmaxrees> lol looks like SomeT is gonna start getting real confused.
[14:08:02] <robertmaxrees> since they're asking the same questions in two different channels.
[14:08:03] <SomeT> I am real confused
[14:08:07] <SomeT> yes I am
[14:08:11] <SomeT> but it was the delay
[14:08:15] <SomeT> I give up on that channel
[14:08:17] <SomeT> ignore it
[14:08:30] <SomeT> approx 4 min delay so it was not a discussion like this
[14:08:44] <taplar> so there seems to be a point of confusion about methods
[14:09:00] <taplar> when you call a function, the only things that happen are what is in that function
[14:09:04] <taplar> nothing else
[14:09:11] <SomeT> ok
[14:09:14] <SomeT> but what is a method?
[14:09:19] <SomeT> I thought it was the same as a function
[14:09:21] <taplar> function(){ ... }
[14:09:21] <SomeT> like in c#
[14:09:24] <SomeT> ah ok
[14:09:25] <taplar> is a function or method
[14:09:30] <taplar> different names for the same thing
[14:09:52] <SomeT> so the question is which method should I be calling?
[14:09:52] <taplar> typically i think people say method when referencing a function on an object
[14:10:05] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:10:24] <taplar> so the question is what you are trying to do
[14:10:47] <taplar> because right now you have an async function that is calling that function and building stuff on the page
[14:10:52] <SomeT> On lines 173, 184 and 194 of: https://hastebin.com/ijavevader.html I am trying to call the function of loadGenres() again so it loads the next movie but does not refresh the entire page, how can  I achieve this because when I use location.reload this refreshes the entire page causing variables to reload which is what I do NOT want. Except for the movie name and genre variables that is.
[14:11:00] <SomeT> that
[14:11:27] <taplar> so here is the question
[14:11:46] <taplar> how much of that async function should happen, when the other three methods happen?
[14:12:52] <SomeT> all of it ideally
[14:13:07] <taplar> ok, so next question.
[14:13:12] <taplar> why not call that method?
[14:13:21] <SomeT> I tried
[14:13:33] <SomeT> loadGenres()
[14:13:39] <taplar> that's not the method
[14:13:39] <SomeT> on that other hastebin I posted
[14:13:45] <SomeT> ok what is?
[14:13:51] <taplar> the anonymous function
[14:14:07] <taplar> ln 81-151
[14:14:12] <taplar> that's your work horse
[14:14:36] <SomeT> yes
[14:14:38] <taplar> which you said "all of it ideally" should run again, if one of the three functions below of it execute
[14:14:39] <SomeT> but calling: async function ()
[14:14:49] <SomeT> that does not work
[14:14:59] <taplar> so the issue is, you can't "call" an anonymous function
[14:15:03] <taplar> it's anonymous
[14:15:03] <SomeT> ok
[14:15:16] <SomeT> you mean asynchonouourous right?
[14:15:21] <SomeT> *asynchronous
[14:15:21] <taplar> nmp
[14:15:22] <taplar> no
[14:15:32] <SomeT> ok
[14:15:33] <taplar> it's both asynchronous and anonymous
[14:15:36] <SomeT> ok ok
[14:15:40] <taplar> but lets focus on the anonymous part
[14:15:53] <SomeT> ok
[14:16:00] <taplar> you can't repeated call an anonymous function, because you don't have a reference to it
[14:16:06] <taplar> so how do you fix that?
[14:16:13] <SomeT> reference  it
[14:16:16] <SomeT> but I can't see it
[14:16:17] <taplar> how so?
[14:16:21] <SomeT> becauses its anonymouse
[14:16:26] <SomeT> so its technically impossible
[14:16:30] <taplar> no....
[14:16:33] <taplar> heh
[14:16:33] <SomeT> ...
[14:16:44] <taplar> you are the master of your code.  you can change anything about it, :)
[14:16:51] <SomeT> true
[14:17:00] <taplar> how can you make something not anonymous?
[14:17:01] <SomeT> I give up on this for today I reckon...
[14:17:09] <robertmaxrees> you're so close though.
[14:17:41] <taplar> how is your code able to execute the "thumbsupFunction" function?
[14:17:55] <SomeT> by me clicking on something on the page
[14:18:02] <robertmaxrees> he means in the code itself.
[14:18:13] <taplar> but how does it know when you click, what to do?
[14:18:14] <SomeT> greenThumbCountE inner html
[14:18:15] <SomeT> etc...
[14:18:34] <taplar> how does it know what "thumbsupFunction" even is?
[14:18:35] <SomeT> because onclick
[14:18:39] <SomeT> on html dom
[14:18:41] <taplar> that's not a native javascript function
[14:18:46] <SomeT> it calls the function
[14:18:49] <taplar> how?
[14:19:00] <taplar> lol, i feel so obtuse right now
[14:19:01] <SomeT> by me clicking
[14:19:23] <taplar> "thumbsupFunction" is not an anonymous function, right?
[14:19:52] <SomeT> probably not no
[14:19:55] <SomeT> because I can see it
[14:19:56] <taplar> why not?
[14:19:59] <SomeT> because I can see it
[14:20:05] <taplar> what do you mean by that?
[14:20:17] <SomeT> in my code it is visible
[14:20:23] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/v01ngdzk/5/
[14:20:23] <taplar> elaborate
[14:20:39] <SomeT> that jsfiddle?
[14:20:40] <robertmaxrees> here's a simplification of what taplar is trying to explain.
[14:21:03] <SomeT> ok
[14:21:05] <robertmaxrees> SomeT what's the difference between those two functions?
[14:21:06] <taplar> if you are walking down the street and you see some guy walking up to you, he's anonymous, right?
[14:21:18] <SomeT> no
[14:21:23] <taplar> he's unknown
[14:21:24] <SomeT> not where I live
[14:21:28] <SomeT> I know everyone
[14:21:29] <robertmaxrees> lo
[14:21:32] <robertmaxrees> *lol
[14:21:39] <taplar> if you're not going to try, why should i?
[14:21:43] <SomeT> I dunno
[14:21:49] <SomeT> I have kinda given up for today tbh
[14:22:09] <taplar> it's anonymous because it doesn't have a name dude
[14:22:14] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^
[14:22:17] <robertmaxrees> so give it a name.
[14:22:22] <robertmaxrees> like in that fiddle.
[14:23:15] <SomeT> so I just have to wrap lines 81 to 151 inclusive in a function right?
[14:23:25] <taplar> it's already a function
[14:23:37] <SomeT> then you have lost me
[14:23:54] <taplar> you want to call the function again
[14:24:00] <taplar> but you cannot, because it is anonymous
[14:24:07] <taplar> so you change it to not be anonymous
[14:24:14] <taplar> then you can (maybe) call it
[14:24:24] <SomeT> how do I even do that
[14:24:32] <taplar> give it a name
[14:25:19] <SomeT> but on what line?
[14:25:38] <taplar> on the function itself
[14:25:49] <taplar> async function myNameWhatever () { ... }
[14:26:11] <robertmaxrees> start by naming it before you worry about moving anything.
[14:29:13] <SomeT> (index):173 Uncaught ReferenceError: newLoadGenres is not defined
[14:29:20] <SomeT> I get that when I try to call it
[14:29:27] <SomeT> which I believe means its out of scope?¬
[14:29:32] <taplar> yes
[14:29:48] <taplar> the reason it is out of scope is because it is currently being created inside $()
[14:29:49] <SomeT> I did: $(async function newLoadGenres() {
[14:29:59] <SomeT> ah makes sense
[14:30:06] <SomeT> how do I call it then if it is out of scope?
[14:30:15] <SomeT> this is one thing that I always get stumped on with javascript
[14:30:23] <taplar> so now to fix that, refactor it so the function is created outside of that $(), leaving the async in the $()

[14:32:13] <robertmaxrees> Woet could you please turn the bot off?
[14:32:22] <robertmaxrees> or make it not auto-respond?
[14:33:09] <taplar> SomeT: almost, but you have to refactor the whole function out
[14:33:17] <SomeT> can you just show me how?
[14:33:28] <taplar> function newLoadGenres(){ ... } $(await newLoadGenres)
[14:33:47] <taplar> though really, i'm not sure you need that await
[14:33:51] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:33:59] <taplar> dunno what it's buying ya
[14:34:02] <SomeT> yeah completely lost by that
[14:34:17] <SomeT> I don't think this is the right way to refactor it...
[14:34:25] <taplar> ?
[14:34:29] <robertmaxrees> why?
[14:35:01] <robertmaxrees> you need to pull that stuff out into a function so you can call it multiple times.  this first steps will be functionally identical to what you have now.
[14:35:33] <SomeT> I give up for todfay
[14:35:38] <SomeT> thanks for the help anyway
[14:35:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:36:11] <taplar> you are literally doing $(async thing)
[14:36:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:36:16] <robertmaxrees> he's gone.
[14:36:16] <taplar> we're just moving the thing and giving it a name
[14:36:18] <robertmaxrees> *test* pastebin
[14:36:23] <taplar> *sigh*
[14:36:34] <robertmaxrees> *testing https://pastebin.com/6ec6wKF6
[14:36:34] <WALL-E> robertmaxrees: In order to help you better, please demonstrate your issue with a minimal amount of code here: http://jsfiddle.net/boilerplate/jquery - replace the HTML/CSS/JavaScript with your test case, click "Fork" at the left top and share the URL here.
[14:36:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's annoying.
[14:36:56] <taplar> jsbin.com/weee
[14:37:28] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/?html,js,output
[14:37:32] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[14:37:51] <robertmaxrees> either way, that dude's just copy/pasting his code.
[14:45:06] <robertmaxrees> what a morning
[14:45:37] <taplar> dude, i was so happy over the weekend.  i got my stupid service worker working
[14:46:15] <robertmaxrees> niiiice!
[14:46:18] <taplar> originally i was initializing my service worker when it was registering, which apart of that i was making the indexeddb
[14:46:20] <robertmaxrees> what all is it doing now?
[14:46:45] <taplar> but then i broke up the registration and initialization, and once it is registered, i make an ajax call to do the initialization, of which i have control over when that request finishes
[14:47:19] <taplar> so it ended up being registration -> initialization of indexeddb -> initialize vue
[14:48:03] <taplar> i also ended up changing window.addEventListener('load') to window.onload = ...   because I saw that if I refreshed the page, it would perform the load multiple times
[14:48:51] <taplar> https://github.com/taplar/taplar-ddoplanner/blob/master/src/application.js
[14:50:35] <robertmaxrees> what's up with that timeout?
[14:51:05] <taplar> for some reason, without the timeout, the route gets a 404.  like the routeRegister isn't fully finished, or the browser hasn't updated something
[14:51:47] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[14:51:55] <taplar> ya
[14:52:15] <taplar> i may figure out something i missed later, but for now that works, heh
[14:52:24] <robertmaxrees> a
[14:52:27] <robertmaxrees> *also:  ActiveXObject( 'Microsoft.XMLHTTP' );
[14:52:28] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:52:39] <taplar> older IE support apparently
[14:52:50] <robertmaxrees> except
[14:52:54] <robertmaxrees> if ( 'serviceWorker' in navigator ) {
[14:52:55] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:52:56] <taplar> though given that vue only supports i think IE 8+, i may can rip that out
[14:53:15] <robertmaxrees> https://caniuse.com/#feat=serviceworkers
[14:53:22] <robertmaxrees> you'd never hit that anyway in IE.
[14:53:25] <robertmaxrees> only edge
[14:53:41] <taplar> well fk
[14:53:42] <taplar> lol
[14:53:45] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:53:51] <robertmaxrees> i've fallen in that trap a few times.
[14:54:04] <taplar> that'll change things then.
[14:54:20] <robertmaxrees> like explaining to our analytics guys that injecting noscript via js doesn't make sense.
[14:54:27] <taplar> lmao
[14:54:54] <robertmaxrees> we have a tag management platform that injects stuff via js.  they kept asking us to make sure we added noscript tags for fallback
[15:00:14] <taplar> so it injects stuff so it doesn't have to be on all the source files?
[15:00:36] <robertmaxrees> aye.  domain sharding and dynamic loading, etc to boot.
[15:06:16] <taplar> now i'm really ready for them to update my box to win 10
[15:06:30] <robertmaxrees> oh?
[15:06:39] <taplar> i don't have a box with edge on it to play with, ^_^
[15:06:43] <robertmaxrees> aaah
[15:06:52] <robertmaxrees> you could always get an IE VM
[15:07:34] <taplar> true, i keep forgetting about those
[15:10:57] <taplar> lol, that is still cracking me up with the IE thing.  i was looking at a few things over the weekend, making sure they had at least like IE 9 support.  >_<
[15:11:13] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[15:11:16] <taplar> pretty sure that's why i have that map shim in there
[15:27:25] <robertmaxrees> today is starting to drag
[15:27:55] <taplar> i'm in a weird limbo with this content security stuff
[15:28:03] <robertmaxrees> oh?
[15:28:46] <taplar> yeah, trying to do a content security policy report only header as a stepping stone for it, but it needs an endpoint for the reporting.  dunno yet where that's going to be
[15:29:18] <taplar> so i'm kinda like, uhhhhh, do i wait on this, or is it ok if i get back to my other work?
[15:29:37] <robertmaxrees> yikes.
[15:29:46] <robertmaxrees> i always just move on for the time being.
[15:29:53] <robertmaxrees> otherwise i'm just burning time.
[16:31:52] <Tierkeium> guys, for sure I'm doing soemthing wrong but I cannot find why it doesn't work: https://pastebin.com/wLSbWYkr
[16:32:29] <robertmaxrees> Tierkeium where's the event binding.
[16:32:59] <Tierkeium> robertmaxrees: it's a jquery $.each, I've just tried to simplify it
[16:33:04] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:33:07] <robertmaxrees> i need to see more code.
[16:33:20] <robertmaxrees> it depends on what $(this) is heh.
[16:33:39] <taplar> also you don't need the () around the second part
[16:33:40] <Tierkeium> $(this) is a serie of elements contaning many classes
[16:33:46] <Tierkeium> no?
[16:33:54] <Tierkeium> that's where the problem resides, I believe
[16:33:58] <robertmaxrees> err.
[16:34:01] <taplar> || all have the same priority
[16:34:09] <robertmaxrees> ^ unless yhou
[16:34:13] <robertmaxrees> *unless you'
[16:34:17] <taplar> it's not like + * and such with different order of operations
[16:34:22] <robertmaxrees> wtf - unless you're trying to group things.
[16:34:31] <robertmaxrees> i'd make a fiddle.
[16:34:43] <Tierkeium> ok, let me show you something more real
[16:35:17] <taplar> i feel like the last || should be an && from your comment
[16:36:09] <taplar> hideprice || (!showbreakfast && !showlunch)
[16:36:41] <Tierkeium> taplar: no, because it could be that one element has showbreakfast and not showlunch, but it could have both
[16:37:18] <taplar> then your comment doesn't reflect that
[16:37:22] <Tierkeium> I could parse the entire list of elements and if I find any of those classes (showbreakfast or showlunch) add one more class and add a class called "showmeal"
[16:37:36] <Tierkeium> but I'm trying to keep it as simple as possible
[16:37:50] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:38:12] <robertmaxrees> i feel like there's a discrepancy between the code and the description
[16:38:15] <taplar> ok, so when exactly should it hide?
[16:39:40] <Tierkeium> is shoud be hidden with hideprice is present, and there is no "showlunch" or "showbreakfast" class, if there is any of showlunch of showbreakfast present, it should not hide
[16:40:25] <taplar> no "showlunch" and no "showbreakfast"
[16:40:39] <Tierkeium> exactly
[16:40:51] <taplar> so the last || is an &&
[16:40:59] <Tierkeium> of showbreakfast is present, it should showup, if showlunch is present, it should show, also if both
[16:41:20] <robertmaxrees> if either showbreakfast or showlunch are on the element?
[16:41:26] <Tierkeium> exactly
[16:41:32] <Tierkeium> sorry my lack of englush
[16:41:40] <Tierkeium> *i*
[16:43:48] <Tierkeium> if ($(this).hasClass("hideprice") || (!$(this).hasClass("showbreakfast") && !$(this).hasClass("showlunch") )) { $(this).hide(); }
[16:43:52] <Tierkeium> like that?
[16:44:00] <Tierkeium> I'll test it, sounds logic :P
[16:44:01] <taplar> yep
[16:44:01] <Tierkeium> heh
[16:45:14] <tables> $("#btnSubmit1").on('click', function() {
[16:45:14] <tables>   $("#formAddUser").attr("action", "/maps");
[16:45:14] <tables> });
[16:45:19] <tables> what's the function to load this again?
[16:45:44] <tables> do i have to have a loader function for something like this
[16:45:46] <tables> ?
[16:46:05] <taplar> what do you mean?
[16:46:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:47:08] <tables> i ran that within <script></script>
[16:47:10] <tables> and it doesn't work
[16:47:21] <tables> never mind lemme make a fiddle and come back
[16:47:59] <robertmaxrees> "the function to load this" i'm so confused
[16:49:28] <Tierkeium> taplar && robertmaxrees many thanks!!
[16:50:04] <Tierkeium> if I could throw up my stupid brain I would!
[16:50:14] <Tierkeium> :)
[16:54:47] <tables> https://paste2.org/UxZpGPs7  <-- this code isn't working, the reload button isn't going to /reloadcontent1.php
[16:55:21] <taplar> it's not in a document ready and it is before the markup
[16:56:29] <tables> how do i do document ready?
[16:56:40] <tables> put the script after the <form> ?
[16:56:47] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/sSNeoFg.png
[16:56:50] <tables> what do you mean by before the markup
[16:56:52] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[17:16:37] <Tierkeium> have a good day, see you!
[17:16:55] <taplar> people telling me what to do
[17:16:57] <taplar> .....rude
[17:17:16] <taplar> tc man
[17:18:37] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha too slow.
[17:18:58] <taplar> :(
[18:50:30] <khobo> hey guys
[18:50:32] <khobo> anyone around?
[18:50:54] <taplar> sure
[18:51:14] <khobo> https://jsfiddle.net/4x7a58qs/25/
[18:51:22] <khobo> see the image gallery
[18:51:30] <khobo> when I click on it it brings the image up into a modal
[18:51:44] <khobo> i want to be able to cycle through the rest of the photos
[18:52:02] <khobo> each click is a new image in the gallery
[18:53:07] <taplar> you have your click event for the myModal bound too high
[18:53:18] <taplar> you need to modify that to only target the x
[18:53:58] <taplar> actually you don't even need line 38-40
[18:54:06] <taplar> the x has inline script on it that will hide the modal
[18:58:03] <taplar> then it's just a matter of keeping track of the image clicked, and when you click the modal picture, get the next image, and move the clicked image tracker to the next displayed image
[19:22:29] <khobo> hey sorry
[19:23:41] <khobo> taplar: then it's just a matter of keeping track of the image clicked, and when you click the modal picture, get the next image, and move the clicked image tracker to the next displayed image
[19:23:47] <khobo> yes i agree! but howwwww
[23:19:11] <Johne> how do I reference a parent $(this)?
[23:35:06] <pavonia> .parent()?
