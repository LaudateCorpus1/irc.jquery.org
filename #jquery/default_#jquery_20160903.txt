[00:00:27] <TWG_> I don't know how I'm going to do that when the data is created by an API on my local machine.
[00:02:11] <ngharo> you can JSON.toString(obj) to capture it as json
[00:02:35] <ngharo> sorry JSON.stringify(obj)
[00:03:21] <TWG_> Making one right now
[00:06:00] <TWG_> I just made a codepen and when I run it, it does it with no issue what so ever.  Hmmm
[00:06:11] <TWG_> http://s.codepen.io/ThatWebGuy/debug/PGoVwj
[00:08:22] <TWG_> Okay.  It appears its an issue what I think is an array of objects.  Turns out it's not.  When I run JSON.stringify(obj); I returns [] with no content;
[00:10:13] <ngharo> likely you're trying to read the data before some XHR returns
[00:11:12] <TWG_> That doesn't run until after my $.ajax returns.
[00:11:27] <ngharo> inside the callback?
[00:12:19] <TWG_> On my success it writes each item from the API to an array called Offices
[00:13:46] <TWG_> This is what Paul Irish helped me with the other day.  http://codepen.io/paulirish/professor/70655f8849df6a23865f8f90528cbfb8/?editors=0011
[00:14:46] <ngharo> show where the $.ajax() happens
[00:15:27] <TWG_> It's the first item that's ran when my javascript is called.
[00:17:03] <TWG_> Sorry, I'm pretty new to javascript
[00:17:22] <ngharo> you have to do all the work inside the callback
[00:17:37] <TWG_> Really?
[00:17:58] <ngharo> yep
[00:18:42] <TWG_> I don't know why he showed me how to return the data to an array then.  If I had known that then I could have written it.
[00:21:07] <TWG_> So there's no way to push that data to an array and then use that array in my different functions?
[00:22:38] <ngharo> many do something like: var processData = function(data) { // do stuff with xhr result here }; $.ajax('/api.php', success: processData);
[00:24:03] <TWG_> Dang.  I might just have to scrap this idea and find something else or a plugin for WP.  I'm on a short time frame and don't think I will be able to fully wrap my head around this with just 2 days left.
[00:24:31] <ngharo> don't give up. drink moar beer
[00:24:46] <TWG_> I'm a liquor person but that won't help me.
[00:30:03] <TWG_> I'm just going to write it in PHP
[00:30:26] <ngharo> my condolences
[00:31:39] <TWG_> It's 100% easier to me than jquery.
[00:32:06] <TWG_> I'm actually almost done with it now.
[00:32:51] <ngharo> async is a bit of a paradigm shift but once you get it, it'll all make sense
[00:33:23] <TWG_> Yeah.  It's given me a headache for the last 5 days.
[00:35:23] <TWG_> I'm out for the night.
[02:11:38] <JosefDe> Hi guys. How can I access a function stored in "this" out of a "self.function" ?
[02:19:23] <JosefDe> anyone an idea?
[02:28:01] <JosefDe> anyone online?
[06:04:28] <JosefDe> Hi guys. Is doing clone(true) bad? As events and data re copied?
[06:04:52] <JosefDe> Even if I don't use that "true"-option the event-handler works on the cloned content
[10:08:30] <Guest92733> Hi there simple question can I use easing on scrollTop?
[10:08:37] <Guest92733> I cannot seem to get it to work?
[10:54:34] <Cork> Guest36298: should work, haven't tried in a long time though
[12:14:42] <Yepp> I initialize event handler outside my class to avoid multiple event registration on every instance. But, inside the event listeners I need a method from inside class. What should I do? Make the method global?
[13:10:54] <firevulpes> Hi, anyone know how to see if a variable exists? The catch being that I'll be saying like - if(typeof(variable + varnumber) !== undefined) {}
[13:11:28] <firevulpes> I wanna see if variable1 exists, if variable2 exists etc
[13:12:45] <firevulpes> Thing is, I don't know how many variables there's gonna be, which is why I need it like this
[13:27:21] <firevulpes> Anyone?
[14:15:37] <z1haze> i am trying to load external json data into an nvd3 line chart, but i am getting no data available
[14:16:10] <z1haze> i return and convert the data exactly how the example shows, and even log it to console.. im wondering if its initializing before the data is actually present.. anyway to make the chart wait til the data it this?
[14:24:44] <z1haze> well that seems to be cause, made it work, but doesnt seem like the best solution
[14:29:51] <ia9371> what is i want to make a navbar button like fade out or something
[14:30:02] <ia9371> Would that be javascript or jquery?
[14:30:34] <ia9371> I would have to individually name each nav button but there wouldnt really work with the software that I am using
[15:01:15] <ThatWebGuy> Can I limit a function to only run on a specific page?
[15:06:00] <Yosi> yes
[15:33:29] <ia9371> that web guy
[15:33:31] <altab> hello, I have a problem; I can't affect the result of an Ajax request in a var : http://pastebin.com/Xv3mbgaw
[18:22:06] <TWG_> Can anyone help me with an asynchronous ajax issue?
[18:33:41] <shoky> maybe?
[19:28:17] <naftilos76> Hi everyone, is there a way to detect the difference inside the anonymous function of the 'el' being actually clicked by the mouse and el triggered programmatically with el.mouse() .  i.e el.on("mouseup", function(e){ ... });
[19:47:34] <shoky> naftilos76: you can check if e.originalEvent is defined or not
[19:51:09] <naftilos76> shoky, thanks a lot
[22:40:20] <ikarius> hullo.  Trying to troubleshoot a jquery ajax call made with “.then”;  the call is hitting the fail function, despite it being actually successful (as far as I see via debug tools network tab.
[22:41:34] <ikarius> … what I am not finding anywhere in the docs is what conditions dictate success vs. failure in $.ajax(request).then{success(), fail()}
[22:46:23] <ia9371> why wouldnt you just switch the else statement
[22:48:47] <ikarius> @ia8371: what else statement?
[22:49:01] <ia9371> you would have to make that condition yourself
[22:49:23] <ia9371> for example if item[1] = 0 fail
[22:49:51] <ikarius> as far as I see in the documentation, all the invocations of $.ajax()  provide a “success” function, a “fail” function, and an “always” function.
[22:50:11] <ikarius> I see no place to specify a conditional which determines success versus failue
[22:50:27] <ia9371> thats like debugging
[22:50:54] <ikarius> … I’m sorry, but I don’t understand.
[22:51:22] <ikarius> the decision of what a success versus a failure is is… internal to jquery, and undocumented?
[22:52:13] <ia9371> https://api.jquery.com/error/
[22:55:47] <ia9371> http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_errors.asp
[22:59:00] <ia9371> http://api.jquery.com/ajaxerror/
[23:00:49] <ia9371> catching exeptions
[23:02:40] <systemfault> If there's an exception, it's a fail... if it's a 4xx/5xx, it's a fail (IIRC)
[23:03:14] <ia9371> exception handling
[23:04:41] <ikarius> … except that as far as I can see, there are no exceptions.
[23:05:00] <ikarius> request completes and returns with 201 status
[23:05:38] <ikarius> expected data is there, expected return type is there,  jquery jumps to error function.
[23:05:53] <systemfault> ikarius: And what is the error message?
[23:06:04] <ikarius> empty
[23:06:42] <systemfault> In the fail handler, there are no arguments?
[23:09:49] <ikarius> … oh hell.
[23:10:05] <ikarius> I missed a parameter.
[23:10:23] <ikarius> “No conversion from text to application/json”.
[23:10:59] <systemfault> Yet your server sends a 201?
[23:11:10] <systemfault> Or the problem is client side?
[23:11:22] <systemfault> Anyway, glad you got some kind of error :)
[23:11:34] <ikarius> server is completely happy
[23:11:55] <ikarius> it’s jquery that’s unhappy.  apparently it doesn’t quite know that I want application/json type back
[23:12:09] <ikarius> … I think.
[23:13:14] <systemfault> Is the server sending json?
[23:13:18] <ikarius> yeah, response is coming back as “Content-Type:application/json; charset=utf-8”
[23:13:27] <systemfault> And the content is actually json?
[23:13:33] <ikarius> yup
[23:13:59] <systemfault> Are you sending JSON or form data?
[23:14:04] <ikarius> sending JSON.
[23:14:16] <ikarius> but apparently I haven’t sufficiently told jquery to expect json back.
[23:14:29] <systemfault> dataType: 'json' should be enough ($.ajax)
[23:14:54] <systemfault> The usual problem with jQuery is sending JSON, not receiving it.
[23:15:06] <systemfault> jQuery loves form data.
[23:15:26] <ikarius> … and that was it.  I had dataType: ‘application/json’
[23:15:47] <systemfault> Nice :D
[23:15:48] <ikarius> and it didn’t like that. soon as I changed it to simply ‘json’, it hit success function instead of fail
[23:15:57] <systemfault> It reverted to the default, 'text'
[23:16:07] <ikarius> yeah
[23:16:31] <ikarius> thank you very much
[23:16:49] <systemfault> Glad I was able to help
