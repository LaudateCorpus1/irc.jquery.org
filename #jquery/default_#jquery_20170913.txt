[02:14:09] <Cork> toowhy would you bind a click handler every minute??
[02:14:40] <Cork> opps
[02:14:43] <Cork> tona: ^
[02:15:17] <Cork> if you want to handle newly added elements, just use event delegation
[02:30:05] <undefined_bob> morning
[04:15:48] <sonu_nk> hi there.. https://jsfiddle.net/1vz0vp8o/1/ here i am using window scroll to add focus class.. i did it for scroll down...
[04:17:02] <sonu_nk> i am not getting wht to do for scroll up to add  focus class.
[04:17:11] <sonu_nk> https://jsfiddle.net/1vz0vp8o/2/ updated one
[04:20:08] <Cork> sonu_nk: scrollTop + height compared to offset().top + height
[04:20:54] <sonu_nk> Cork, where you indicating me to change it ?
[04:21:14] <Cork> sonu_nk: no just how you would handle scroll up checks
[04:22:13] <sonu_nk> scroll up is detecting .. but i am not getting how to find the div postition and compare and remove add focus class..
[04:23:47] <Cork> that is what i just told you
[04:28:36] <sonu_nk> Cork, honeslty i did not get you..
[04:28:48] <sonu_nk> can we do a fiddle update ?
[04:29:52] <Cork> don't have the time
[04:30:00] <sonu_nk> :)no issue hanx
[04:30:03] <sonu_nk> thankx
[04:30:12] <Cork> but the point is you have to compare the bottom of the window and element not the top of them for scroll up to work
[04:30:39] <sonu_nk> yes same i and also looking bottom
[04:30:42] <sonu_nk> but seems failed
[05:45:57] <mdc> hey
[06:19:26] <mdc> anyone home?
[06:33:21] <Kingsy> how can I add an extra form attribute to a form using jquery? basically within a function I want to add a custom key value to the form then submit it via submit()
[06:43:01] <sonu_nk> https://jsfiddle.net/btzw97wn/ my this animation is not working with keyboard scroll..
[06:47:55] <Cork> Kingsy: is it a normal http post or are you using ajax?
[07:07:29] <patchie> anyone who can se an error in my code? document.querySelectorAll('.ms-browser').forEach(function(el) { el.style.display='block';})
[07:12:13] <Kingsy> Ah I got it by using append() on the form
[07:12:16] <Kingsy> Cork: thanks :)
[07:12:38] <Cork> on the form??
[07:12:45] <Cork> you mean formData?
[07:13:15] <Cork> patchie: what is the error?
[07:13:16] <Kingsy> $j(form).append('<input type=hidden... kinda thing
[07:13:25] <patchie> cork, doesnt work in IE it seems
[07:13:33] <Cork> ah, ya, if you need it for a normal http post you have to append
[07:13:38] <patchie> Cork: my code: https://jsfiddle.net/2386z90p/6/
[07:13:43] <Cork> patchie: forEach is new
[07:13:43] <Kingsy> :) thanks for the reply tho
[07:13:56] <Cork> might not exist in the version if ie your running in
[07:14:14] <patchie> cork: what do you recommend for my code? it must work in IE :P
[07:14:19] <patchie> since the code is for IE users
[07:14:22] <Cork> do you have jquery?
[07:14:25] <patchie> yes
[07:14:35] <patchie> jquery-1.10.2.js
[07:14:48] <Cork> $('.ms-browser').css('display'. 'block
[07:14:51] <Cork> * $('.ms-browser').css('display'. 'block');
[07:15:06] <Cork> or possibly even just $('.ms-browser').show();
[07:25:32] <patchie> Cork: it works, perfect :D
[07:25:37] <patchie> you are the man!
[07:26:00] <Cork> nice that it worked
[08:10:25] <biomin>  https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=26zj5nn7sD Can somebody tell me why is this not working? (I want my startdate to be less than end date)
[08:17:46] <MikeD_> biomin: i don't see any code at all

[08:37:22] <biomin> localh0st: which msg?
[08:37:34] <localh0st> 14:34 < localh0st> Input plain JavaScript code, no HTML.
[08:39:53] <biomin> localh0st: yes I have changed it
[08:48:50] <Cork> also click save and post the url
[08:48:57] <Cork> *new url
[09:04:16] <biomin> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=26zj5nn7sD Can somebody tell me why is this not working? (I want my startdate to be less than end date)
[09:11:22] <undefined_bob> I see no code there. is it just me?
[09:19:25] <biomin> undefined_bob: https://jsfiddle.net/#run&togetherjs=26zj5nn7sD
[09:37:27] <Cork> undefined_bob: he isn't hitting save so ya, its the same for everyone
[09:37:42] <Cork> (and why he isn't getting any response from ppl)
[09:38:09] <undefined_bob> Cork: oh sad
[09:39:53] <`ULT> Hi I have a little code what is doing the following: when hovering over a.preview, get title and replace default value productUitvoering with new title
[09:40:25] <`ULT> When mouseleave, return to old default value
[09:40:30] <`ULT> You can check on: https://jsfiddle.net/njvtzstm/1/
[09:40:59] <`ULT> What I`m wondering is that I could make this more simple and could remove first line and second function
[09:50:13] <Cork> `ULT: https://jsfiddle.net/njvtzstm/2/
[09:51:42] <`ULT> thanks Cork
[09:51:51] <`ULT> witch version do you prefer and why?
[09:52:38] <localh0st> `ULT: the halloween one
[09:52:39] <Cork> `ULT: or simply just https://jsfiddle.net/njvtzstm/3/
[09:52:57] <Cork> `ULT: i prefer the last one, as it is by far the cleanest
[09:53:49] <Stummi> when loading a HTML document via $.ajax(), is there a way to retrieve some data from the loaded documents DOM via selector?
[09:54:03] <`ULT> yes I like that one also more. Thanks
[09:54:06] <Cork> Stummi: you can't load a document through ajax
[09:54:22] <Stummi> I do not want to display the loaded html, just run a selector on it to fetch some data
[09:54:31] <Cork> Stummi: ajax can only load a fragment and you just have to parse it before you append it if you want to select in it
[09:54:33] <Stummi> Cork, I can't? why not?
[09:54:52] <Cork> cause if you want to load a full page it isn't meant to be inserted into another page
[09:55:23] <Cork> you can through error correction convert the full page into a fragment, and jquery does this by default
[09:55:26] <Stummi> yeah, I don't want to insert it
[09:55:33] <Cork> so don't
[09:56:06] <Cork> $.ajax(url).done(function(data) { $($.parseHTML(data)).find('#target').text() == 'something'; })
[09:56:39] <Cork> though note that as it isn't a document but a fragment, you will have to differenciate between if it is the first element or a child
[09:56:55] <Cork> so sometimes you will have to use $(data).filter('') instead of $(data).find()
[09:57:55] <Cork> join spammers...
[09:58:01] <Stummi> Cork, well, thanks
[09:58:27] <Cork> ah, no it was from a split >_>
[09:58:33] * Cork goes back to work
[09:58:36] <Cork> Stummi: np
[10:12:01] <biomin> Cork: I dont think there is a need to hit save.. It is working i have checked it with my friends.. and I also have sent the link again..  :-) here is the link.. a fresh one.. http://jsfiddle.net/PPSh3/7/#&togetherjs=G0BAv2lK4c
[10:12:20] <biomin> undefined_bob: http://jsfiddle.net/PPSh3/7/#&togetherjs=G0BAv2lK4c
[10:24:30] <Cork> biomin: it works for the one creating the fiddle, but it often doesn't show anything for others
[10:25:20] <biomin> Cork: u sure that it s still not visible? this link: http://jsfiddle.net/PPSh3/7/#&togetherjs=G0BAv2lK4c ??
[10:25:41] <Cork> no, cause that one has a stored reference: http://jsfiddle.net/PPSh3/7 <--
[10:27:20] <Cork> biomin: you set minDate on the current element based on getDate from the current element
[10:27:39] <Cork> you prob want to replace $(this).datepicker('getDate') with dt2.datepicker('getDate')
[10:29:47] <biomin> Cork: sorry but that was not mine.. that was one of the fiddles i was going through! excuse
[10:31:47] <biomin> Cork: well, can you please go through this.. ?? https://dpaste.de/zYBn .. I wonder whats wrong with my fiddle.. sorry fr the inconvenience
[10:44:20] <taplar> biomin: what part isn't working?
[10:44:42] <grapheti> I'm trying to figure out how to make this pan when zoomed, but contain it within the element and not drag it. Any ideas? - https://codepen.io/Graphettion/pen/boGrMb
[10:46:45] <biomin> taplar: I donot get the expected outcome
[10:47:32] <taplar> ^ vague
[10:48:01] <taplar> specifically, what part is not working?
[10:48:17] <taplar> and what are you expecting that is not happening
[10:56:10] <poboy> so how would you tackle this?  When the fields are full the users want to hit "copy" then when opening a new file "paste" the contents.  https://pasteboard.co/GKbNrxM.png
[10:56:22] <poboy> I believe I'd need a global js variable to do this
[10:56:58] <taplar> what are you calling a 'new file' ?
[10:57:11] <poboy> another copy of the thing I linked
[10:57:28] <taplar> you could always throw it into sessionStorage
[11:00:03] <poboy> I will look into that, thanks
[11:12:42] <biomin> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/nihir90/2XABa/69/#&togetherjs=hepFkORanH this is what I exactly want.. but I donot know why it doesn't work here: https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=IcwvTCqUNo
[11:13:39] <taplar> you've yet to explain what "doesn't work" means
[11:14:26] <taplar> and that fiddle has neither jquery nor bootstrap included in it
[11:14:31] <biomin> taplar: the calender doesn't even appear in the latter case..
[11:15:14] <taplar> those fiddles use different libraries
[11:15:30] <taplar> the first uses jquery ui, the second used bootstrap, going off of the options provided to the initializier
[11:20:30] <taplar> you also have a missing "]." on the end if your first daysOfWeekDisabled
[11:20:35] <taplar> ],
[11:22:25] <biomin> taplar: thanks for the reply! so, how can I achieve the functionality that im intending to get, using the js in the latter one? what all changes are to be done
[11:22:57] <taplar> include jquery, bootstrap, and the bootstrap datepicker files in your fiddle
[11:26:18] <biomin> taplar: I have added.. are you able to see?
[11:26:44] <biomin> taplar: as im using them in my project
[11:34:30] <taplar> see what?  i can't see anything unless you make a fiddle to show what you got
[11:35:36] <taplar> but i included those 3 things in the fiddle you shared earlier and it worked
[11:37:16] <biomin> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=IcwvTCqUNo
[11:37:34] <taplar> i'm not joining a togetherjs man
[11:38:22] <taplar> jquery, bootstrap css, bootstrap js, bootstrap-datepicker css, bootstrap-datepicker js, add those
[11:39:09] <biomin> taplar: added
[11:39:24] <biomin> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/svca02r1/6/
[11:39:47] <taplar> no dude
[11:39:57] <taplar> use the External Resources on the LHS to add the files
[11:40:04] <voiter> i am issuing a jquery ajax call that is not shown in the network tab. In the error method of the call i get this: https://pastebin.com/ZAViYe3p
[11:40:08] <voiter> any explanation?
[11:40:39] <taplar> voiter: show us the ajax call you are trying to make?
[11:40:41] <voiter> and where can i find the source text/code that causes the syntax error?
[11:40:51] <voiter> taplar, hold on
[11:42:13] <voiter> taplar, https://pastebin.com/gPcepKHt
[11:43:10] <taplar> before line 14, console.log( data ) and see what you get
[11:44:08] <voiter> taplar, i must add that this code behaves as expected in firefox but not in chrome and opera.
[11:44:25] <taplar> o.O
[11:45:37] <voiter> taplar, since there is an error in the call itself (which is why error() is triggered), method success (line 13) is never called.
[11:45:50] <poboy> here's an example of what I'm working with.  https://jsfiddle.net/m4hq6ooo/  when they click "copy" I want to save all the inputs then the next time that form is open let them "paste" in the saved info
[11:45:58] <poboy> I'd appreciate any guidance
[11:46:08] <taplar> voiter: console.log( data) before the ajax call then
[11:47:01] <taplar> poboy: it looks like you understand using the storage.  so what's the question?
[11:47:36] <voiter> taplar, that's this object. i have to check if there is a stringify method or something.
[11:47:47] <poboy> so how do I tell jquery "populate each of those input areas with the values that were entered when "copy" was clicked"
[11:48:16] <taplar> voiter: the error is seeming to say it's having an issue turning data into json, which is why i'm asking you to console log the value of data that is being turned into json to see what it is
[11:48:21] <taplar> poboy: you don't
[11:48:31] <taplar> you lookup the fields that you want to put in storage, and you put them there
[11:48:51] <taplar> you can look them up with jquery, but you have to write all the logical steps
[11:49:14] <taplar> i'm assuming you are familiar with jquery lookups?
[11:49:53] <poboy> taplar, not very
[11:50:03] <taplar> are you familiar with css?
[11:50:06] <poboy> i'm on month 2 of using jquery.  :)
[11:50:08] <poboy> yes
[11:50:21] <taplar> so you know how to make selectors in css to target things?
[11:51:25] <poboy> like :target {     border: 2px solid #D4D4D4; }   ?
[11:51:29] <taplar> sure
[11:51:32] <poboy> ok
[11:51:38] <taplar> that ':target' would be the "selector"
[11:51:44] <taplar> so in jquery all you have to do is
[11:51:48] <taplar> $(selector)
[11:51:56] <taplar> most css selectors work in jquery
[11:52:03] <taplar> if not all
[11:52:18] <taplar> $('#anId')
[11:52:22] <taplar> $('.aClass')
[11:52:23] <taplar> etc
[11:52:55] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/
[11:53:02] <voiter> taplar, doesn't matter if i use FormData() or {..}, it's the same error.
[11:53:20] <taplar> can you show me what the data element is?
[11:53:25] <taplar> you wouldn't convert a FormData() to json, fwiw
[11:53:27] <voiter> same happens when data = {}
[11:53:39] <taplar> data is an empty object?
[11:53:50] <voiter> i tried with that for debugging reasons.
[11:53:54] <voiter> same snytax error
[11:54:36] <taplar> for shiggles, comment out the mimeType setting
[11:54:43] <taplar> i need to look that up in the api
[11:58:53] <taplar> doesn't seem like it would be the error
[11:59:32] <taplar> have you found the request in your network console by chance?
[12:03:09] <poboy> taplar (or whomever), how do I pass #date into the alert?  https://jsfiddle.net/m4hq6ooo/1/
[12:03:58] <poboy> I guess i need .val()  in there but still not working
[12:04:07] <taplar> you're missing your $ on the front of that, if you meant that to be a jquery lookup
[12:04:24] <taplar> and that's a global variable.  it will be available every where
[12:05:01] <poboy> sheeet
[12:14:37] <poboy> heh, it's a start.  https://jsfiddle.net/m4hq6ooo/2/    thanks for the feedback taplar
[12:19:42] <poboy> ok everyone.  how do I set an array of variables here?  This is only showing the last variable.  https://jsfiddle.net/m4hq6ooo/3/
[12:23:14] <tona> hello guys
[12:24:38] <tona> how could i read the value showed in this <p class="title">{{title}}</p>    $(".title").click(function() { title = $(this).text(); } not seem to wok :( i am wondering if someone could help me
[12:26:25] <rjCousineau> I'm having trouble selecting first level elements and not further elements...  Any help? https://jsfiddle.net/016wscLo/
[12:29:19] <taplar_lunch> :first-child isn't first level
[12:29:42] <taplar_lunch> children('tbody') or find('> tbody') would be first level
[12:30:03] <rjCousineau> > wasn't matching
[12:31:18] <rjCousineau> master <table> can have <table class="table">
[12:31:31] <rjCousineau> but still $('.table>tbody') still selects children tbody
[12:31:56] <taplar_lunch> cause .table is a global lookup on all levels
[12:32:26] <rjCousineau> but nested <table> doesn't have that class name, it shouldn't match... but it does?
[12:32:44] <taplar_lunch> updated fiddle?
[12:33:13] <rjCousineau> https://jsfiddle.net/016wscLo/1/
[12:34:12] <rjCousineau> doh.  find('>tr>td')
[12:34:14] <rjCousineau> that works
[12:35:57] <rjCousineau> fixed it.. thanks
[12:35:59] <taplar_lunch> https://jsfiddle.net/016wscLo/2/
[12:36:13] <rjCousineau> elegant.
[12:36:22] <rjCousineau> thanks
[12:46:05] <tona> how could i read the value showed in this <p class="title">{{title}}</p>    $(".title").click(function() { title = $(this).text(); } not seem to wok :( i am wondering if someone could help me
[12:46:37] <taplar_lunch> are you sure that's not working?
[12:48:29] <taplar_lunch> https://jsfiddle.net/tn1phqk9/  works fine
[13:08:00] <poboy> so taplar, in the project the 2nd form is on it's own page.  How do I paste the value of #date into the correct field on the second form?  https://jsfiddle.net/m4hq6ooo/4/
[13:09:36] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m4hq6ooo/5/
[13:10:00] <robertmaxrees> since jsfiddle is one page you'll having issues with duplicate IDs
[13:10:44] <poboy> yeah, I actually just figured that on my own!  small victories here...
[13:10:50] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[13:10:52] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[13:10:58] * taplar thumbs up
[13:11:11] <grapheti> poboy++
[13:12:01] <poboy> but now instead of just passing in #date I'm trying to figure how to pass in an array that will contain the values of all the necessary elements
[13:12:14] <taplar> use a json object
[13:12:18] <taplar> err, object
[13:12:38] <taplar> make an object, put what you want to preserve in it, then store that in the storage by stringifying it
[13:13:12] <taplar> then when you paste, grab that value, parse it, then you have all your stuff
[13:14:18] <poboy> I don't suppose you could show an example?
[13:14:47] <taplar> var blah = {};   blah.firstName = 'Mark';  sessionStorage.setItem('data', JSON.stringify(blah));
[13:14:58] <poboy> thanks
[13:15:48] <taplar> var newBlah = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('blah')); //do stuff with newBlah
[13:16:06] <taplar> course you'd want to make sure blah existed before you try to parse it
[13:16:32] <taplar> but as yoda say, mmmm, gist you get
[13:19:41] <grapheti> https://i.imgur.com/odXtNR4.png

[13:25:07] <grapheti> REJECTED!
[13:29:19] <grapheti> Tryin' to get that focal point zoom and pan, but it drags the whole image - https://codepen.io/Graphettion/pen/boGrMb
[13:29:45] <grapheti> tried containment for panzoom, but ain't working and I'm sad - http://timmywil.github.io/jquery.panzoom/demo/#contain
[13:30:05] <grapheti> like that storm trooper
[13:33:30] <grapheti> taplar, what you have for lunch?
[13:33:39] <grapheti> I had a Rueben :D
[13:33:54] <grapheti> Reuben*
[13:33:57] <taplar> chicken salad thing with some kind of chipotle dressing
[13:34:08] <grapheti> ohhh, that sounds good
[13:34:23] <taplar> it was ok.  i had him put egg on it which i kinda regretted
[13:34:51] <grapheti> lmao
[13:35:19] <taplar> not egg egg.  but boiled egg whites chopped up
[13:35:30] <grapheti> I would have got a chicken caesar salad, but the bagel place was out of chicken. So I just got a Reuben.
[13:35:38] <grapheti> ye, gotcha
[13:35:52] <taplar> i actually tried a salad thing at subway the other day.  i kinda dig em
[13:36:02] <grapheti> nice
[13:36:05] <grapheti> I'll have to try it.
[13:37:05] <taplar> i do like the oven roasted chicken breast, spinach, lettus, tomatoes, pickles, and chipotle, and then they chop it up and mix it
[13:37:18] <taplar> super good.  one i added the banana peppers on and it was good to
[13:37:24] <grapheti> nice
[13:37:39] <grapheti> that all sounds good
[13:37:52] <taplar> and then i got a sprite, cause ya know, fk eating healthy and what not, lol
[13:38:10] <grapheti> not a fan of tomato unless it's those round ones.
[13:38:29] <taplar> oh yeah, those are nice
[13:38:45] <grapheti> grape tomato is what they're called
[13:38:56] <taplar> i think i prefer chopped over those though
[13:39:03] <grapheti> ye
[13:39:20] <grapheti> lol @ sprite
[13:39:24] <taplar> :D
[13:39:31] <taplar> i think that every time i get a soda with a salad
[13:39:43] <grapheti> I got a pure leaf unsweet black tea and a red meat cancerous Reuben.
[13:39:50] <grapheti> So we were the opposite.
[13:40:07] <taplar> you ever tried the ..... pure peak?  something peak
[13:40:18] <grapheti> not sure
[13:40:24] <taplar> i need to google
[13:40:25] <grapheti> is that tea?
[13:40:27] <taplar> ya
[13:40:37] <taplar> gold peak
[13:40:40] <grapheti> I just know of Pure Leaf
[13:40:41] <grapheti> ohhh
[13:40:42] <grapheti> yes
[13:40:48] <grapheti> We have that too.
[13:40:52] <taplar> i think gold peak is the best store tea i've found
[13:41:04] <taplar> all the others, to me, have a bad after taste
[13:41:35] <taplar> GP has an after taste too, but the least i've found
[13:43:11] <taplar> heh, to speak volumes of how much i like it, i actually have packs of it at home we got from sams club
[13:44:31] <taplar> "red meat cancerous Reuben" lol
[13:45:05] <poboy> so this one's not pasting the info.  what error(s) in syntax do I have?  https://jsfiddle.net/m4hq6ooo/6/
[13:45:35] <taplar> line 13, extra ')'
[13:45:51] <taplar> as your console should be telling you
[13:47:01] <poboy> thanks
[13:55:04] <Es0teric> when changing a div's visibility from display:none;, .show() should be able to do that right:
[13:55:05] <Es0teric> ?
[13:55:22] <taplar> yep
[13:55:31] <Es0teric> i wonder why the div isnt showing then
[13:55:41] <taplar> inspect it and see what is making it hidden
[13:55:46] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pbgLn9tb/
[13:55:49] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[13:55:56] <grapheti> taplar, hehe
[13:56:10] <taplar> wut?
[13:59:29] <grapheti> > taplar  "red meat cancerous Reuben" lol
[13:59:34] <Es0teric> oh nvm... it turns out i had !important on the css
[13:59:35] <taplar> ah
[13:59:43] <taplar> that'll do it
[14:00:00] <poboy> it just passes in "newBlah.date".  When I remove the quotes there is no value.  Shouldn't there now be a newBlah.date?  https://jsfiddle.net/m4hq6ooo/7/
[14:00:22] <taplar> 'newBlah.date' <-- that's a string
[14:00:44] <taplar> :|
[14:00:47] <poboy> yeah, I tried without, also tried newBlah.val()
[14:01:10] <taplar> so lets talk about what you are doing
[14:01:31] <taplar> you're making a 'blah' object, which is empty
[14:01:42] <taplar> you are then setting the date on it to the value of the date element
[14:01:45] <taplar> what's that elements value?
[14:03:02] <poboy> it's the value of #date
[14:03:07] <taplar> which is?
[14:03:18] <poboy> whatever date that was selected
[14:03:23] <taplar> but it's blank
[14:03:35] <taplar> no?
[14:04:32] <poboy> blah.date is blank
[14:04:37] <taplar> yep
[14:05:04] <poboy> i don't understand why
[14:05:09] <taplar> it's blank in the markup
[14:05:15] <taplar> this script is running on page load
[14:05:35] <taplar> you have handlers below, but the setting of date is being done at the start before any of that
[14:06:24] <taplar> if you want it to be set 'when something happens', that 'something' refers usually to an event of some kind
[14:06:40] <poboy> the variables were before the on click, ok
[14:06:51] <taplar> :)
[14:07:35] <poboy> thank you, I fixed it
[14:07:43] <taplar> good deal
[14:08:01] <poboy> you and robertmaxrees are awesome, btw.  You guys are very patient with ignoramuses like me  :)
[14:08:46] <taplar> i'm going to do my best to push you towards being able to read your own code and understand it so that you can compare what you have with what you want so you, yourself, can decide where the errors are
[14:10:01] <grapheti> taplar++
[14:10:42] <grapheti> I'm trying to figure out how to make this pan when zoomed, but contain it within the element and not drag it. Any ideas? - https://codepen.io/Graphettion/pen/boGrMb
[14:11:55] <grapheti> I'm using jquery panzoom and it has contain events, but they're not working for doing a focal point zoom :(
[14:12:32] <taplar> i think it is?
[14:12:45] <taplar> err, well i'm dragging it
[14:13:06] <grapheti> yeah, I want it to function like this - https://codepen.io/Graphettion/pen/KXKgrM
[14:13:11] <grapheti> where you can't drag at max scale
[14:13:26] <grapheti> but also have the focal point work
[14:14:26] <taplar> is there a way to know that you are at max scale so you could disable the pan?
[14:14:33] <taplar> i don't know anything about this plugin
[14:14:44] <grapheti> you're fine, understood
[14:15:00] <grapheti> there is an option to disable the pan
[14:15:12] <grapheti> So perhaps I could write a condition.
[14:16:09] <grapheti> but it will probably still move the element when zoomed
[14:16:41] <grapheti> just wish I could fit it to the container or something
[14:22:03] <grapheti> curse you https://github.com/timmywil/jquery.panzoom
[14:23:35] <grapheti> https://i.imgur.com/WPhDHhT.gif
[14:38:18] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/cwvLr9dy/  me playing around.  no dragging
[14:40:18] <grapheti> nice
[14:40:36] <grapheti> I do want dragging, just where the zoomed image is
[14:41:07] <grapheti> not where it's dragging the image off the page or element area
[14:41:36] <grapheti> like that - https://codepen.io/Graphettion/pen/KXKgrM
[14:42:04] <grapheti> this looks awesome tho
[14:42:12] <grapheti> nice taplar
[14:42:20] <Al_nz1> morning all
[14:42:34] <grapheti> afternoon
[14:43:34] <poboy> ok, so this is working as intended - https://jsfiddle.net/m4hq6ooo/9/   but when trying to refactor to $('input').each I'm unsure what to put at the bottom of the fiddle.  https://jsfiddle.net/hfnc98cr/1/
[14:44:04] <Al_nz1> anyone here able to tell me how  to make a comment area in a fixed size scrollable box, where each comment is tagged with user/date time?
[14:44:11] <taplar> poboy: you don't push to an object
[14:44:18] <taplar> you set keys to values
[14:44:43] <taplar> your <input> should have a .name and a .value
[14:49:03] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/hfnc98cr/2/
[14:49:25] <Al_nz1> hey taplar
[14:49:33] <taplar> aloha
[14:49:40] <Al_nz1> haha - u in HI?
[14:49:49] <taplar> i wish
[14:54:50] <poboy> ah, ok Taplar. I see the info present in the console now. so how to set the .val() for each input on the bottom?
[14:55:29] <taplar> var someObject = {};  someObject[ "someKey" ] = "someValue";
[14:55:59] <taplar> to load your object to be stored in the storage
[15:01:00] <Al_nz1> any ideas about a comments style area taplar?
[15:01:24] <taplar> i don't have any context into your question
[15:02:07] <Al_nz1> a logged in user to a DB, can type in a comment, which goes into a fized size box will scroll bars
[15:02:26] <Al_nz1> comments are recorded with the users name and date time
[15:03:01] <Al_nz1> You see this sort of thing a lot on blogs
[15:03:07] <taplar> sure
[15:03:10] <Al_nz1> though this isnt a blog
[15:03:21] <taplar> a pseudo chat feature
[15:03:34] <taplar> or guestbook
[15:04:06] <Al_nz1> is it done with a plugin or?
[15:04:23] <Al_nz1> I tried googling, but my vaguness stopped me getting anything I really wanted
[15:04:38] <taplar> there may be plugins written for that.  i dunno.  but the backend is definitely something you'd most likely hvae to write
[15:04:55] <Al_nz1> I can handle the backend side of it
[15:05:10] <Al_nz1> what sorta terms would you google?
[15:05:16] <Al_nz1> is it likely to be a JS thing or
[15:05:24] <taplar> personally i'd just write something small myself to do it
[15:05:46] <taplar> they people are already logged in?
[15:05:53] <taplar> r/they/the
[15:06:59] <Al_nz1> yes
[15:07:05] <Al_nz1> so would you use a table or?
[15:07:09] <grapheti> http://i.imgur.com/lbCh3Fb.jpg
[15:07:36] <taplar> lol
[15:07:40] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 it's not tabular data heh
[15:07:40] <taplar> table for what?
[15:08:08] <robertmaxrees> basically, you want a chatbox kinda thing, right?
[15:08:25] <taplar> if you are going to make something yourself, first thing you gotta do is separate your UI concerns from your Logical concerns
[15:08:31] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:08:37] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yes
[15:08:40] <robertmaxrees> and also have a rough idea about what it is you want to build.
[15:09:07] <robertmaxrees> getting a rough draft design down would be a good idea here.
[15:09:14] <taplar> so if they are already logged in, the session identifies who they are
[15:09:17] <Al_nz1> the concept is simple.A box for inputing a comment.
[15:09:21] <taplar> probably throw in a CSRF for good measure
[15:09:35] <taplar> then at minimum you need an endpoint that accepts that CSRF with the message
[15:09:38] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 a box for inputting a comment?  <input type="text" name="comment">
[15:10:02] <Al_nz1> Hit enter and it goes to a rolling log in a fixed size area above, with each comment attributed to user and date / time
[15:10:10] <Al_nz1> seems very common on blog sites
[15:10:14] <taplar> that's UI concern
[15:10:14] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[15:10:23] <taplar> you don't even have the other logic yet, :)
[15:10:27] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:10:37] <taplar> make it work first, make it pretty later
[15:10:51] <robertmaxrees> fwiw there are drop-in solutions for commenting.
[15:11:06] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yes - my google fu failed me on that
[15:11:14] <Al_nz1> care to reccomend any?
[15:11:16] <robertmaxrees> this for a wordpress site or something?
[15:11:23] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: no
[15:11:27] <robertmaxrees> and do you need users to be tied back to your system?
[15:11:36] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: closed site, users are already logged in
[15:12:01] <Al_nz1> bootstrap themed
[15:12:09] <robertmaxrees> then a homebuilt setup would probably be your best bet.
[15:13:18] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: you forget you know how to do that. Im still lost as to how it might be done without using a textarea or table lol
[15:13:25] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:13:42] <taplar> you're most likely going to use a textarea for the input
[15:13:43] <robertmaxrees> it's inputs and some minimal html for the frontend.
[15:13:46] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:13:53] <robertmaxrees> it's a basic form.
[15:14:02] <taplar> but again, you're thinking about the pretty part, not the functioning part
[15:14:15] <grapheti> this looks pretty - https://codepen.io/peternguyen/pen/nDEFI
[15:14:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:14:48] <grapheti> :P
[15:14:59] <Al_nz1> sorry - kids crying....bbs
[15:15:00] <taplar> is that wysiwyg a plugin i assume?
[15:16:03] <taplar> or i guess it's hand rolled
[15:16:47] <taplar> i thought it might be summernote for a sec
[15:17:21] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 so the ui portion is pretty easy.  and the backend is a basic CRUD
[15:17:42] <robertmaxrees> though really you'd just need the CR part hahaha
[15:18:05] <taplar> yeah, and then we have to talk about if the expectation is live update
[15:18:30] <robertmaxrees> the repeated thing about it being like a blog comment tells me probably not.
[15:18:39] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't start with that, at least.
[15:18:44] <taplar> nah
[15:18:51] <robertmaxrees> especially if you're just learning.
[15:23:13] <robertmaxrees> welp
[15:24:02] <taplar> he had to step away because of kc and jojo
[15:26:19] <grapheti> http://i.imgur.com/PjB6JeX.jpg
[15:26:38] <taplar> man he's red
[15:26:43] <robertmaxrees> http://www.reasonsmysoniscrying.com/
[15:26:50] <grapheti> lol
[15:27:04] <grapheti> robertmaxrees, haha
[15:28:04] <poboy> heh, putting this in my project and my password is displayed in the console!  $('input, select').each(function() { console.log( this.name, '=>', this.value );
[15:28:23] <robertmaxrees> yarp
[15:28:23] <taplar> whut?
[15:28:34] <robertmaxrees> poboy sounds about right.
[15:28:54] <taplar> did you type your password into one of the fields?
[15:28:59] <poboy> i didn't realize it woudl do that
[15:29:16] <robertmaxrees> poboy it's a text field.
[15:29:21] <robertmaxrees> what else would it do?
[15:29:34] <poboy> i just assumed that would be hidden somehow
[15:29:41] * taplar hopes it's a text field and not a hidden field
[15:29:44] <robertmaxrees> newp
[15:29:58] <poboy> **** shows up on the screen.  so no mask or anything in the console
[15:30:06] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:30:14] <robertmaxrees> because you're getting the DOM value of the field.
[15:30:24] <robertmaxrees> the value and the display don't match for password fields.
[15:40:20] <poboy> possibly my last issue of the day - https://jsfiddle.net/m4hq6ooo/9/  when selecting "service" it copies and pastes fine, but the same logic in my project and the service dropdown doesn't populate with the dat
[15:40:23] <poboy> a
[15:43:22] <robertLunch> check to make sure your selector is good.
[15:47:32] <taplar> your service dropdown isn't dynamic is it?
[15:51:46] <poboy> it is
[15:51:59] <taplar> so that would be why it's not loading
[15:52:33] <poboy> so the value has an integer, and on the screen we echo the name
[15:52:39] <taplar> you'd have to trigger the change logic on the carrier dropdown after it is set to make the dynamic logic kick off, and after it is done, set the other one
[15:53:09] <taplar> assuming the carrier change causes the dynamic part to start
[15:54:21] <poboy> <option value="<?php echo $service['int_FileServiceID'];?>"><?php echo $service['serviceName'];?></option>
[15:54:56] <taplar> that's not what i mean by dynamic
[15:55:17] <poboy> oh, what did you mean?
[15:55:20] <taplar> does the options in the service dropdown change real time when a user select a carrier?
[15:56:17] <poboy> ah, no.
[15:56:39] <taplar> ok, so so long as the option exists with the value it should be able to be set
[15:57:13] <poboy> my console shows the correct value, but the screen does not update with what we are trying to echo based on that value
[15:58:16] <taplar> verify that an option exists with that value
[16:08:22] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yes real time - comments show up right away
[16:08:36] <Al_nz1> you keep saying youd hand roll it - care to elaborate?
[16:08:57] <robertmaxrees> ah, you don't want comments, then.  i'd look up how to build your own chat.,
[16:09:22] <robertmaxrees> and "hand roll" just means "build it myself"
[16:11:28] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: thanks - yes I know it means buildit yourself, but can you tell me a little more detail?
[16:11:34] <Al_nz1> like what container etc?
[16:11:39] <Al_nz1> or link to example
[16:11:40] <robertmaxrees> "what container"?
[16:11:47] <robertmaxrees> you mean, like... how to build it?
[16:11:47] <Al_nz1> what html
[16:12:00] <robertmaxrees> i'd focus on getting everything else working.
[16:12:04] <taplar> ^
[16:12:09] <Al_nz1> getting what working
[16:12:11] <robertmaxrees> the chat.
[16:12:20] <robertmaxrees> that's going to be the hard part.
[16:12:24] <Al_nz1> how to build the chat?
[16:12:29] <grapheti> lol
[16:12:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:12:37] <Al_nz1> its going to be some jquery that inserts the comment, into some html?
[16:12:43] <Al_nz1> the html will not be a table?
[16:12:45] <Al_nz1> not a text area?
[16:12:47] <Al_nz1> what then?
[16:12:54] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:12:55] <Al_nz1> whats the fixed area container made up up?
[16:12:58] <robertmaxrees> duder
[16:12:59] <robertmaxrees> slow down`./
[16:13:02] <robertmaxrees> https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-simple-web-based-chat-application--net-5931
[16:13:11] <robertmaxrees> you just want a chat.
[16:13:21] <robertmaxrees> lots of tutorials about how to build that.
[16:13:32] <Al_nz1> its like a invoice for a sale and you want to add a few comments to the sale
[16:13:42] <Al_nz1> its not really a back n forth type thing
[16:13:46] <Al_nz1> bbs
[16:13:50] <robertmaxrees> err...
[16:13:55] <robertmaxrees> you said you wanted realtime updates.
[16:14:06] <robertmaxrees> how is what you're describing NOT like a chat?
[16:14:27] <taplar> i think he's conflating one way updates with live updates from the server
[16:14:53] <robertmaxrees> "yes real time - comments show up right away"
[16:15:05] <robertmaxrees> i take that to mean "things show up on the page as they're entered
[16:15:17] <taplar> ya, but he means he enters a comment, it's gets sent, and then that comment is added to his existing listing
[16:15:18] <taplar> i'm assuming
[16:15:33] <grapheti> like a tweet?
[16:15:34] <taplar> but he won't see other peoples comments right away
[16:15:38] <robertmaxrees> ah
[16:16:03] <robertmaxrees> that kind of clarification would be nice.
[16:16:08] <taplar> or that's how my brain is rationalizing it
[16:16:24] <taplar> ^_^
[16:18:39] <grapheti> so we back to something like this? - https://codepen.io/peternguyen/pen/nDEFI
[16:18:40] <grapheti> :P
[16:19:00] <taplar> its
[16:19:10] <taplar> (i think so)
[16:19:13] <taplar> bad acronym
[16:19:28] <grapheti> haha, I like it!
[16:36:51] <jazzinimal> hi
[16:37:49] <taplar> bonjour
[16:45:35] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: when you said realtime, yes the comment shows up immediately - as in its not moderated
[16:45:46] <Al_nz1> but its not people typing back n forth like we are now
[16:45:56] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[16:46:02] <Al_nz1> its a comments thing - not a chat thing
[16:46:18] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, basic CRUD.  the frontend JS just appends the contents to the comments area.
[16:46:20] <robertmaxrees> bam, done.
[16:46:36] <Al_nz1> but what is the comments area?
[16:46:44] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:46:46] <Al_nz1> a textarea i think we said no
[16:46:47] <robertmaxrees> html.
[16:46:49] <Al_nz1> table no
[16:46:54] <taplar> whatever you want it to be
[16:46:56] <robertmaxrees> textareas are for inputs.
[16:47:00] <robertmaxrees> tables are for tabular data
[16:47:10] <robertmaxrees> hell you could use a UL
[16:47:17] <Al_nz1> so what would it be then (it needs to be in a fixed size container
[16:47:30] <Al_nz1> so as the comment list grows its scrollable
[16:47:35] <taplar> this is getting more into a UI discussion, rather than jQuery
[16:47:39] <robertmaxrees> that's done via CSS.
[16:48:18] <robertmaxrees> scrollable areas are easy to build.
[16:49:20] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: build using?
[16:49:28] <robertmaxrees> html and css.
[16:49:33] <robertmaxrees> try making a scrollable area.
[16:49:35] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:50:58] <cannap> set a height:1px and add overflow-y:2px
[16:51:03] <cannap> scroll*

[16:56:22] <cannap> :/ sry
[18:02:06] <Al_nz1> So I need to find way to select the last <br/> https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/37114/ ?
[18:02:50] <Al_nz1> so comments are appended to the bottom
[18:17:01] <taplar> append() puts the stuff at the end
[18:17:45] <taplar> 'textarea#comment' <-- don't do this.  just do '#comment'
[19:04:46] <Sebastian_91> hi
[19:05:03] <Sebastian_91> I ran into a problem and would like to ask for help
[19:05:32] <Sebastian_91> this code works for every select on a wordpress site, except some which are in a modal window:
[19:05:35] <Sebastian_91> jQuery(document).ready(function($) { $( "select" ).change(function() { alert( "something has been selected" ); }); });
[19:06:02] <Sebastian_91> the question is:  why does nothing happen when a <select> field in a modal window gets changed?
[19:12:23] <pavonia> Sebastian_91: The elements in the modal window don't yet exist at the time the handlers are registered
[19:24:37] <Al_nz1> my content from the text area needs to be insterted into the panel : https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/37130/
[19:24:56] <Al_nz1> it looks like its not find the panel when trying to append?
[19:26:22] <Al_nz1> ok - so I think it is getting inserted but in the wrong place
[19:44:17] <Al_nz1> I presume if I want to alernate row color here https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/37141/ jquery is the way to go?
[19:57:43] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeee
[20:11:19] <Al_nz1> hey robertmaxrees....Im getting there : https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/37150/
[20:11:23] <Al_nz1> roll your own dude
[20:12:38] <robertmaxrees> rad
[20:13:02] <robertmaxrees> btw $('.panel-body').find('br').append('<br/>hello' + comment); - don't do this heh
[20:13:30] <robertmaxrees> but nice.
[20:14:42] <Al_nz1> this approach better : https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/37152/
[20:15:10] <robertmaxrees> uh
[20:15:45] <robertmaxrees> "hey don't do this thing" "how's this version where i'm doing the exact thing you just mentioned?"
[20:15:56] <robertmaxrees> appending to <br> tags is weird.
[20:16:07] <Al_nz1> should find .row?
[20:16:34] <robertmaxrees> err, "append" means "insert as the last element".
[20:16:55] <Al_nz1> well its not inserting anything at the moment prepend or append
[20:17:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:17:10] <robertmaxrees> just telling oyu that the approach itself has a problem ;)
[20:17:16] <robertmaxrees> i'ma blow your mind.
[20:18:03] <Al_nz1> $('.panel-body').find('.row').preappend(rowfragment);
[20:18:11] <Al_nz1> but I still have a consoel error
[20:18:13] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/DTcHh/37155/
[20:18:21] <robertmaxrees> i changed 3 things there -
[20:18:43] <robertmaxrees> your "rowfragment" (which isn't technically a fragment) was missing a + after the comment var.
[20:18:53] <robertmaxrees> i added a class to the comments container element.
[20:18:57] <robertmaxrees> semantic classnames are rad.
[20:19:12] <Al_nz1> right,so the overall approach was correct but the selector was right off
[20:19:26] <robertmaxrees> also: $('textarea#comment') - don't prepend selectors with elements if you can help it.
[20:19:29] <robertmaxrees> especially IDs.
[20:19:42] <Al_nz1> ok
[20:19:49] <tripflex> hey guys, trying to understand `this` concept, but can anybody point me in the right direction as to figure out why this is happening: https://jsfiddle.net/c6r5pp6r/
[20:20:11] <tripflex> my guess is that it's because wpmails.templates.check the second time is being invoked by jquery and sicne i'm so used to PHP "this" works differently with JS than PHP so it's got me confused a bit , so when invoked by jquery "this" becomes document instead of the currently object (or at least parent object)
[20:21:32] <robertmaxrees> nope
[20:21:33] <Al_nz1> what should I call rowfragment - what is it?
[20:21:34] <robertmaxrees> A function call of the form `a.b()` calls the function with `this` set to the value of `a`; in a call of the form `f()`, `this` will be `undefined`, which is turned into the global object if the function wasn't defined in strict mode.  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this  http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/30/understanding-javascripts-this/
[20:21:54] <robertmaxrees> well Al_nz1, what is something surrounded by quotes?
[20:22:11] <Al_nz1> string
[20:22:26] <robertmaxrees> also: do you need to specify the type as apart of the name of the var?
[20:22:52] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: what do you mean type?
[20:23:11] <robertmaxrees> the programming concept?
[20:23:20] <Al_nz1> var String etc
[20:23:25] <robertmaxrees> not var.
[20:23:29] <robertmaxrees> like in js you have string, number, object
[20:23:43] <Al_nz1> right...type casting
[20:23:54] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[20:23:57] <robertmaxrees> not casting
[20:24:02] <robertmaxrees> that's a related concept.
[20:24:12] <tripflex> @robertmaxrees not sure how i missed the moz doc in google search ... derrppp thank you lemme read it some more
[20:24:25] <robertmaxrees> tripflex definitely :) you'll get your head around it pretty quick.
[20:24:33] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 in js we usually call that type conversion fwiw.
[20:25:09] <Al_nz1> so should the line var rowstring be called something else?
[20:25:30] <robertmaxrees> why not just var newRow ?
[20:25:46] <tripflex> yeah i just think php it was has confused me with it, so used to OOP in php :-\
[20:25:47] <Al_nz1> ok,and not var?
[20:25:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:26:05] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 whatnow?
[20:26:12] <Al_nz1> <robertmaxrees> also: do you need to specify the type as apart of the name of the var? <--- was the comment refering to the name?
[20:26:22] <Al_nz1> *naming
[20:26:23] <robertmaxrees> the name of the var....
[20:26:31] <robertmaxrees> "rowfragment" vs "rowstring" or w/e
[20:26:34] <robertmaxrees> not the var keyword.
[20:26:43] <Al_nz1> so your saying it should be newRowString
[20:26:52] <robertmaxrees> no.
[20:27:00] <robertmaxrees> i'm asking why the type needs to be apart of the variable name]
[20:27:26] <Al_nz1> it doesnt. I thought you were suggesting it should
[20:27:30] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[20:27:40] <robertmaxrees> i was purely asking if there was a reason for it.
[20:28:02] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xhoqvnma/
[20:28:02] <robertmaxrees> fwiw.
[20:28:05] <robertmaxrees> some more small changes.
[20:28:28] <robertmaxrees> also that preventDefault() isn't really necessary in that fiddle.
[20:29:56] <Al_nz1> nice.thanks
[20:53:11] <Sebastian_91> pavonia!  I am so sorry.  I fell asleep in front of my screen after I asked my question!
[20:53:55] <Sebastian_91> pavonia, Thank you for your answer!
[22:43:33] <futzhu> how to outputting my backend results https://pastebin.com/raw/U9hXjfh6 like loading instalation app with jquery?
[23:47:57] <energizer> I have a bunch of inputs in a form, but the form can add inputs dynamically, so i want to join them all into json like this https://dpaste.de/5SWy and submit that json instead
[23:48:13] <energizer> How do I submit the json instead?
