[00:11:15] <dan2k3k4> on ajax success, how can I perform multiple functions?
[00:11:55] <dan2k3k4> success: function(data) { } -> then other functions after?
[00:13:06] <romdi> success: function(data) { foo(); bar(); }
[00:13:43] <dan2k3k4> so I can't do other functions outside/after function(data)?
[00:14:11] <romdi> I don't really understand the question. just put the code inside the callback?

[00:25:44] <gavrochel> hello
[00:27:22] <gavrochel> iI want to get the text from a parent <li> whe a child <li> is clicked and I use this: $(this).parent().prev().parent().children("li").text() . Is there a smarter way to do this?
[00:27:37] <chenvirus> hi  everyone.  I need a little help ~. http://jsfiddle.net/mT7fr/    It is a bug or something ?
[00:30:05] <shoky> gavrochel: why .prev().parent()  and not just .parent()
[00:30:21] <shoky> gavrochel: the prev would have the same parent anyway.  and yes tehre's a better way, use .closest()
[00:32:08] <gavrochel> @shocky please fork this: http://jsfiddle.net/gavroche/zVv6j/7/
[00:35:38] <gavrochel> I can't get it to work with closest()
[00:37:39] <shoky> gavrochel: first of all, you're appending a <ul> to a <ul>
[00:37:54] <shoky> shouldn't do that
[00:38:35] <shoky> gavrochel: which element do you want to target ..
[00:38:47] <shoky> your example doesn't make sense
[00:41:18] <shoky> also you're adding click handlers on every click
[00:41:33] <okdamn> hey is possible to convert base64 image to binary string in js?
[00:45:40] <shoky> gavrochel: anyway.. .closest('.start')

[01:11:02] <jax> I got this input field (just a form with 1 input field) and a button behind it. I attached some button.click action to do some jquery.load. but when the user hits enter, it still goes to the URL. how can i tell the enter key to also do that jquery.load?
[01:15:50] <nisseni> if I get json data in return, can I somehow place chosen parts from it as field values?
[01:39:56] <fRAiLtY-> Is this line invalid? var cover = h('</div>').prependTo('body');
[01:40:02] <fRAiLtY-> Says unexpected token ILLEGAL
[01:43:07] <jax> can this be optimized somehow?
[01:43:07] <jax> https://dpaste.de/c2pGy/
[01:46:47] <yuka> jax anything can be optimized
[01:47:07] <yuka> jax - http://jsperf.com/add-jq-or-js-class
[01:47:08] <yuka> check this out
[01:47:39] <yuka> jquery removeClass and addclass are much slower functions
[01:47:43] <yuka> then javascript versions

[01:52:07] <snorti> i have problems with my third navigation button, the width is strange... http://tinyurl.com/lhtev8o and the sub menu show a border from the above menu
[01:53:51] <yuka> snorti: .rex-article-3 {     width: 116px;
[01:53:53] <jax> how can i control what the enter key does when hit in a form?
[01:53:55] <yuka> delete the width
[01:54:02] <yuka> and ask next time in #css
[01:54:06] <yuka> caus this is css problem
[01:54:48] <yuka> set the width to 145px or so
[01:55:38] <yuka> jax what you wanna do
[01:56:02] <snorti> yuka: no this wont be working for some future changes
[01:56:28] <yuka> what changes
[01:56:30] <yuka> the problem is css
[01:56:35] <yuka> not jquery :)
[01:56:37] <snorti> maybe the name changes
[01:56:37] <yuka> thats that

[02:33:50] <sonOfRa> I'm trying to achieve a sortable table where I can drag <td> elements around in the entire table. I've tried using sortable from UI, but with weird side effects that I can't explain to myself: http://jsfiddle.net/j8zjq/1/. The <td>s aren't restricted to the original table, but instead can extend it and make the <tr> elements grow in size, which is definitely not what I was trying to achieve. Any insight
[02:33:50] <sonOfRa> on this?
[02:37:57] <jax> yuka: i have a form with just one input and a button. i attached an action to the button. i would like to attach the same action to the enter key
[02:38:00] <sonOfRa> Or is the table approach maybe a wrong idea? I'm just kind of brainstorming at the moment, maybe there is a better thing to use than a table with swappable <td> elements for this? Basically what I'm doing is a schedule that has draggable events, and when dropping events, there is an ajax check in the background if the element can actually go there
[02:38:08] <jax> because currently, when the user hits enter, it tries to submit the form via the normal <form action
[02:38:59] <SergeyPenkin> Guys, what's wrong with this code: http://pastebin.com/FmfUGQym

[04:28:12] <fRAiLtY-> Anyone about?
[04:31:28] <titii> i would ask, the ON is not an alternative of Delegate?
[04:47:35] <olukyanov> ok, so i'm developing a web POS sistem and currently all actions are performed using ajax (product search by keyword, barcode and category). The sale person will never leave this window. I need to create a "shopping cart" for the added products but i'm no decided on where to store the data until sale is completed. I was thinking to store everything (product quantities) into a javascript object
[04:47:36] <olukyanov> until sale is completed, is this a good ideea ?

[05:07:38] <Zerhackos> hi! currently evaluation jquery mobile.

[05:26:48] <sonOfRa> I'm trying to grasp draggable and droppable, and I seem to have figured some of it out, but I'm wondering how to put the element I dragged "inside" of the html element that is the droppable: http://jsfiddle.net/yrLbE/5/
[05:27:15] <sonOfRa> The drop event is definitely firing, but I'm not sure how to force the draggable into the table again after dropping it
[05:29:32] <sonOfRa> another addition will be to make the draggable go back to where it came from if the position it was dropped on is unacceptable, but I'd like to do one thing at a time
[05:29:43] <okdamn> SargoDarya:  yep , but then i get blank image on php side
[05:29:51] <funkt> http://jsfiddle.net/wdWXj/ Hi there I have a menu system of tabs here at this link what I would like to do is for it to shift up or down depending on the content inside I have tried to specify heights for the id's but nothing seems to work would anyone maybe have any ideas?
[05:29:54] <okdamn> like it is not fully posted
[05:30:11] <SargoDarya> okdamn: That sounds like something is wrong in the PHP script
[05:30:21] <SargoDarya> exactly how long is the string supposed to be?

[05:36:25] <iliakan> hi
[05:36:45] <iliakan> does *anyone* knows why jQuery assigns elem to elemData for events?

[05:37:10] <iliakan>     eventHandle.elem = elem;

[06:38:51] <veQue> parseFloat($("[name='Money']").val().replace(/$/%/,/g, ''), 10) || 0 hi I found this code and it works, I need to know exactly how it  is working
[06:39:36] <veQue> it's supposed to make any none numer value be represented as 0
[06:41:37] <amcsi_work> veQue, in javascript, when you do (a || b), the result is "a" if "a" isn't falsy (meaning 0, undefined, null or false or a few others), and "b" otherwise
[06:42:04] <amcsi_work> NaN is another falsy value
[06:42:10] <veQue> ohhhh
[06:42:19] <veQue> that's what i needed to know.
[06:42:21] <veQue> thanks
[06:42:26] <amcsi_work> np
[06:43:09] <amcsi_work> it's a weird javascript thing, but it can be useful in having to write a bit less code than in other programming languages
[06:46:23] <amcsi_work> I don't see how the regex in replace works though as it's incorrect
[06:46:57] <amcsi_work> it should be /[\$%m]/g
[06:47:02] <amcsi_work> it should be /[\$%,]/g
[06:47:44] <veQue> well it works... don't know why either
[06:54:52] <sammich> quick q before I have to go (to sleep): with z-indexes, can I make a child element stack below it's parent?
[06:56:24] <drager> Can't you do this? $('.status_online', '.status_offline').tipsy({gravity: 'sw'});
[06:56:38] <drager> I want both to have that function
[06:56:45] <BillCriswell> drager: $('.status_online,.status_offline')
[06:57:22] <sammich> use valid CSS in the selector
[06:57:30] <sammich> plus some extensions jQuery provides
[06:57:46] <sammich> first argument is the query, the second is an optional context
[06:58:37] <BillCriswell> sammich: Don't think you can do it with a child element.
[06:58:53] <BillCriswell> Unless you have a grandparent to work with.
[06:58:58] <sammich> that's what I suspected
[06:59:17] <sammich> well, it's a child because that's the easiest way to position it right below the parent
[06:59:22] <sammich> with top:100%
[07:00:24] <drager> BillCriswell: Hm, duidnt work
[07:00:33] <sammich> wanted it to be a div that slides from underneath, so it looks like a sheet slightly shadowed by the 'parent'
[07:00:57] <sammich> BillCriswell: ah, I totally get what you're saying now
[07:01:08] <sammich> totally doing that now
[07:01:34] <drager> BillCriswell: Nevermind, thanks
[07:01:44] <BillCriswell> drager: :)
[07:08:14] <JAAulde> morning, jquerians
[07:10:12] <aspiration> hello
[07:10:38] <aspiration> somebody please help me troubleshoot my error
[07:10:43] <aspiration> alert($(id).attr('id')); doesn't work in Ie
[07:10:46] <aspiration> IE
[07:11:02] <BillCriswell> aspiration: What is id?
[07:11:21] <BillCriswell> Is your HTML valid? Are you running in quirks mode or something odd?
[07:12:37] <aspiration_> sorry got dc.
[07:13:16] <aspiration_> Question is :: alert($(id).attr('id')); gives error in IE.
[07:13:29] <aspiration_> works perfectly in chrome.
[07:13:46] <aspiration_> any alternate method for .attr()?
[07:13:53] <BillCriswell> aspiration: Is the HTML valid?
[07:13:59] <BillCriswell> Or close to it
[07:14:22] <aspiration_> yes.. it works perfectly in chrome.
[07:14:52] <BillCriswell> aspiration: http://jsbin.com/axizuj/1/edit If this works in IE, there's something else wrong with your code.
[07:15:38] <aspiration_> that worked.
[07:15:59] <culo> mobibot:weather ZBAA
[07:16:03] <BillCriswell> aspiration_: There you go.
[07:19:50] <BillCriswell> aspiration_: I'd validate the HTML. Look for something like... insanely wrong.
[07:20:00] <BillCriswell> Chrome may be able to recover from it and not IE.
[07:21:36] <aspiration> alert($(id).attr('id')); in this if I just alert ($(id) then it gives me proper [Object Object]
[07:22:49] <BillCriswell> aspiration: Any plugins that might be messing with $.fn.attr?
[07:23:32] <aspiration> i haven't installed any plugins.
[07:23:56] <BillCriswell> What is id?
[07:24:02] <BillCriswell> Just a string liek #foo ?
[07:25:00] <aspiration> id contains reference to <object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="male/Expressions/expression8.swf" width="60" height="60" id="div4" class="asset" style="visibility: visible;"><param name="wmode" value="opaque"><param name="flashvars" value="localConnectionId=1374589349338"></object>
[07:25:33] <aspiration> then this object also has an attribute named id.
[07:35:44] <ph88> i'm trying to wrap something in a jQuery of not wrapped already ... why does this not work ?   if (! target instanceof jQuery) target = $(target);
[07:36:22] <culo> #mobibot
[07:36:30] <culo> #mobibot:weather ZBAA
[07:36:35] <culo> #mobibot :weather ZBAA
[07:37:14] <culo> btw, how to comunicate with mobibot asking about today's weather ?
[07:38:55] <BillCriswell> I'm not sure that guy was in the right place.
[07:40:15] <ph88> BillCriswell: do you know about wrapping with jQuery ?
[07:42:37] <ph88> oh got it :|
[07:42:40] <BillCriswell> ph88: I'd just do $(target); if target is already a jquery object it just won't do anything to it.
[07:42:58] <ph88> solution:   if (! (target instanceof jQuery) ) target = $(target);

[08:30:38] <BillCriswell> _pash: I don't think anything noticable.

[08:30:53] <airdem> im trying to get the px width of a td that has 30% width in css
[08:31:02] <airdem> .width() returns 30
[08:31:09] <airdem> any way to get the actual px value?
[08:31:58] <jop008> I try window.orientation => udnefined
[08:32:03] <jop008> Chrome desktop
[08:34:14] <BillCriswell> airdem: That number should be in pixels.
[08:34:28] <BillCriswell> If you got 30 for 30% it's just a coincidence.
[08:36:04] <airdem> BillCriswell, it was because of asynchronous ajax
[08:36:22] <BillCriswell> airdem: I have no idea how, but ok.
[08:37:11] <airdem> the element was loaded via ajax and i forgot to select it in the callback of ajax
[08:37:27] <BillCriswell> airdem: Got it. Awesome.
[08:37:39] <airdem> thank you for helping
[08:37:44] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[08:38:11] <boulderdave> How come when I grab a child <tr> element from a table - I'm not able to perform simple functions such as .html() on it… I get "TypeError: Object #<HTMLTableRowElement> has no method 'html'"
[08:38:39] <boulderdave> I'm calling like this: $("#current_route_table").children('tr')[0].html()
[08:39:01] <RohanBhangui> why cant you use id for the tr that you are trying to grab
[08:39:12] <airdem> ("tr:eq(0)")
[08:39:15] <airdem> i believe
[08:39:23] <BillCriswell> boulderdave: You probably want .eq(0), not [0]
[08:39:36] <BillCriswell> [0] returns the dom element, which doesn't have a .html method.
[08:39:52] <boulderdave> airdem:  awesome thanks!  works perfectly!  THanks BillCriswell as well
[08:40:48] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[08:43:36] <HoRcRuX> is there a JQ plugin to generate QR codes?

[08:44:39] <RohanBhangui> :) your welcome
[08:44:43] <qkzoo> Hi - Why is it I can update the text in this <h3 id="notification"> as "#appSignUp h3" but not "#notification"? code: http://pastebin.com/MpKgqktA
[08:44:58] <HoRcRuX> yeh.. i kno.... wanted to initiate a talk... nothing else came hehe
[08:49:53] <qkzoo> Hi - Why is it I can update the text in this <h3 id="notification"> as "#appSignUp h3" but not "#notification"? code: http://pastebin.com/MpKgqktA
[08:50:13] <RohanBhangui> qkzoo: calm down we are thinking
[08:50:27] <qkzoo> sorry :)
[08:51:18] <RohanBhangui> where is #appSignUp
[08:51:21] <jop008> I convert my picture using imagic but orientation is changed in EXIF
[08:51:23] <RohanBhangui> oh sry found it
[08:52:02] <jop008> I had jpeg with wrong orientation saved it as png with OSx tool photo was okay
[08:52:05] <NoiseEee> https://www.google.ca/search?q=imagemagick+orientation+exif&oq=imagick+ori&aqs=chrome.3.69i57j0l3.4002j0&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 @ jop008 / ##php
[08:52:12] <jop008> using imagick it wasn't
[08:52:36] <RohanBhangui> qkzoo: this might not help but i want to confirm something: change the #notification to differnt id name temprorarily and see if problem is fixed
[08:52:44] <NoiseEee> jop008: why you're asking that in #jquery is a mystery
[08:53:09] <qkzoo> ok
[08:53:43] <RohanBhangui> NoiseEee: lol
[08:53:54] <RohanBhangui> qkzoo: still have problem
[08:56:08] <qkzoo> Yes, still not working
[08:56:21] <jop008> my site is jquery
[08:56:34] <jop008> but I go 2 php
[08:56:52] <RohanBhangui> qkzoo: give me sec looking
[08:57:02] <qkzoo> thx
[08:57:17] <RohanBhangui> try: h3#notification
[08:57:30] <qkzoo> ok
[08:58:33] <qkzoo> Hey, that worked!
[08:58:49] <RohanBhangui> im surprised #notification didnt work
[08:58:56] <RohanBhangui> but ya sometimes i do that
[08:59:06] <RohanBhangui> h3 is a tag based selector
[08:59:12] <RohanBhangui> then you specifiy the id
[08:59:19] <qkzoo> Oh thank God, I was about to give up!
[09:00:16] <RohanBhangui> lol #jquery: always on standby
[09:00:24] <qkzoo> Thats how I will do it from now on, thank you thank you thank you!
[09:00:25] <RohanBhangui> your last hope
[09:00:28] <RohanBhangui> :P
[09:00:33] <RohanBhangui> next to of course google
[09:01:17] <qkzoo> lol ya, I tried Google, ended up butchering my code in the process...
[09:02:33] <jop008> I have a picture when I open it with chrome with file open orientation is portrait
[09:02:33] <jop008> [6:02pm]
[09:02:49] <jop008> same picture in jqmobiel side is sideways
[09:02:56] <jop008> so it is a jquery question
[09:02:57] <civilordergone> hey guys, i'm doing an ajax request to my RESTful API and it throws this: {"readyState":0,"responseText":"","status":0,"statusText":"error"}, but when i access the url in the browser it returns the proper JSON object and it even worked before too.  i have no idea what's causing it to break.  Here's the snippet..:http://pastie.org/8167819
[09:03:32] <jop008> firefox handles the picture also with sideways
[09:03:32] <BillCriswell> What are the response headers?
[09:03:44] <BillCriswell> civilordergone: ^^
[09:03:47] <jop008> ? asking who?
[09:03:49] <qkzoo> ok, now wait...
[09:03:50] <qkzoo> after i run it once, the text stops updating if I hit the submit button again.
[09:04:04] <clh> hi folks .. my jqm app stopped being responsive .. anybody know where to look for the code that should be doing that?
[09:04:20] <civilordergone> BillCriswell, h/o
[09:05:17] <RohanBhangui> clh: try reimporting jquery mobile base code
[09:05:22] <RohanBhangui> *base css and stuff
[09:06:08] <civilordergone> this is weird.. BillCriswell it's not getting logged as a request  in chrome network inspector
[09:06:39] <civilordergone> well maybe that's a start haha
[09:06:42] <clh> RohanBhangui: will do, thanks.  its odd .. works using iPhoney which is a webkit-based browser, but not on my actual device
[09:06:49] <BillCriswell> The plot thickens.
[09:06:57] <civilordergone> ^^
[09:07:04] <RohanBhangui> lol
[09:07:25] <RohanBhangui> clh: you did custom styling for your jquery mobile site?
[09:07:53] <clh> yes, there is some .. I inherited the project recently
[09:07:57] <RohanBhangui> cause then importing the (what i like to call) skeletal css will be easier
[09:08:17] <qkzoo> RohanBhangui: The h3 text updates the first time the submit button is pressed, but not second+ How is this?
[09:08:20] <RohanBhangui> clh: http://jquerymobile.com/download/
[09:08:36] <RohanBhangui> qkzoo: really? hmmmmmm
[09:08:48] <qkzoo> Yes
[09:09:02] <rocky> is there a most common way of documenting the api (ie inline comments) for jquery plugins that you write yourself?
[09:09:15] <rocky> such as docstrings in python, javadocs for Java
[09:09:17] <rocky> etc
[09:09:44] <RohanBhangui> qkzoo: do you get error message?
[09:09:56] <qkzoo> no
[09:10:03] <RohanBhangui> like add to the ajax request a error callback
[09:10:14] <RohanBhangui> and see what you get when you print the error to the console
[09:10:38] <RohanBhangui> you should make sure code is working everywhere from the time that the submit button is pressed to the the time that you get data back
[09:10:44] <qkzoo> ok thx
[09:10:46] <Soopaman> rocky, i've always subscribed to the descriptive variables and function names
[09:10:57] <RohanBhangui> qkzoo: let me know what you get
[09:11:05] <RohanBhangui> clh: any luck?
[09:11:12] <Soopaman> 'cause no-one ever really reads the api/documentation/comments
[09:11:15] <rocky> Soopaman, that's a good start... but with a large api you really need docs... can you imagine if jquery proper didn't have api docs?
[09:11:18] <clh> RohanBhangui: working on it
[09:11:21] <RohanBhangui> kk
[09:11:33] <Soopaman> rocky, does jquery have proper docs? :P
[09:11:47] <Soopaman> i usually block comment when I do crazy shit
[09:12:01] <Soopaman> that may not be obvious, or when I tail call recurse
[09:12:04] <BillCriswell> http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/ This looks fun, rocky.
[09:12:18] <rocky> yeah block comments is what i'm referring to, but i'm talking about writing those comments in a style so that some sort of autodoc generator can pull it out and generate html documentatino
[09:12:19] <BillCriswell> I never really used any though. Project don't get that big here sadly.
[09:12:28] <Okt> I have a feeling $(this) is causing me some grief, if anyone has a quick second http://jsfiddle.net/jxy6Y/1/
[09:13:14] <Soopaman> ohhhh, yeah I can't remember what that's called, when you could @function @variable comment.. lemme google
[09:13:35] <RohanBhangui> Okt: looking
[09:13:39] <rocky> yeah it's hard to google since looking up "common jquery plugin comment api" keywords yields totally different results
[09:14:29] <RohanBhangui> Okt: what is the issue
[09:14:30] <Soopaman> it's I think it's the java syntax that most ide's use
[09:14:56] <rocky> Java uses something called javadocs
[09:15:07] <Soopaman> http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html
[09:15:21] <BillCriswell> Okt: I think you want .attr('id')
[09:15:25] <BillCriswell> or this.id
[09:15:30] <BillCriswell> but not $(this).id
[09:15:36] <RohanBhangui> why?
[09:15:46] <Soopaman> and that structure is followed by most ide's and there should be a js equiv
[09:16:04] <Okt> this.id seems to have had the correct effect.
[09:16:35] <BillCriswell> Okt: You can also save yourself some headache by using .serializeArray()
[09:16:50] <RohanBhangui> Okt: ^^ +1
[09:17:22] <Okt> BillCriswell: I'll look it up. I'm guessing it's a function to do what I'm trying to do the long way... probably written a lot beter
[09:17:26] <RohanBhangui> BillCriswell: for my understanding why did Okt use a variable to store his function
[09:17:31] <Okt> Thanks RohanBhangui and BillCriswell
[09:17:36] <RohanBhangui> np
[09:18:06] <BillCriswell> Okt: Haha, you bet. It doesn't output it in exactly the format you seem to want but it's easier to work with.
[09:18:19] <BillCriswell> Okt: Expecially when you start putting like... radio buttons and shit into the mix.
[09:18:31] <Okt> BillCriswell: There are LOTS of radio buttons...
[09:18:32] <RohanBhangui> agreed^^
[09:20:08] <RohanBhangui> Okt: here is a performance tip: TRY to avoid using .each when you can and use for loop instead
[09:20:17] <RohanBhangui> in this case its fine
[09:20:27] <RohanBhangui> but for the future
[09:20:33] <gho5t> cache the length too if you're gangsta
[09:20:55] <BillCriswell> Okt: http://jsbin.com/amomep/1/edit
[09:21:38] <RohanBhangui> gho5t: lol
[09:21:49] <naquad> how do i get current settings from DataTable?
[09:27:23] <RohanBhangui> qkzoo: any luck
[09:27:32] <gho5t> naquad: wrong chan?
[09:27:38] <RohanBhangui> lol
[09:28:06] <naquad> gho5t, looks like only one where i can ask about it :(
[09:28:28] <gho5t> what is a DataTable
[09:28:30] <gho5t> ado.net?
[09:29:07] <qkzoo> Yes, I changed the selector for the .submit from "#frmAppSignUp" to "form#frmAppSignUp" like we did with the h3, and bingo, that was it :)  !!
[09:29:49] <BillCriswell> qkzoo: That shouldn't fix anything.
[09:30:03] <qkzoo> hmm, it did.
[09:30:08] <gho5t> lol
[09:30:13] <RohanBhangui> lol
[09:30:27] <RohanBhangui> i once had some ajax cod ethat i just wrote it didnt work
[09:30:33] <jop008> If I let the user choose portrait or landscape how can I force portrait ?
[09:30:39] <RohanBhangui> rewrote enitre thing the exact same way and it worked
[09:30:48] <jop008> Some css hack?
[09:30:48] <NoiseEee> jop008: again, not a question for #jquery
[09:30:53] <RohanBhangui> lol
[09:30:58] <RohanBhangui> mre like #css
[09:30:58] <qkzoo> ....this is a jquery mobile project
[09:31:02] <jop008> come on it it a jquery site
[09:31:12] <jop008> and I need to know how
[09:31:14] <RohanBhangui> but its a css question
[09:31:14] <NoiseEee> jop008: you can probably specify an argument in your imagick/php stuff
[09:31:28] <jop008> no not possible
[09:31:32] <gho5t> RohanBhangui: http://twicsy.com/i/S3Aahd
[09:31:35] <jop008> I tried for 3 days now
[09:31:51] <jop008> so imagick not the tool to use
[09:31:53] <NoiseEee> jop008: and you think it'll be solved via jquery how exactly?
[09:31:58] <RohanBhangui> gho5t: nice
[09:32:02] <RohanBhangui> i loled
[09:32:09] <orentanay> I've found some good tutorials on polymorphic dispatchers, but I'm not finding a good tutorial / or even the name of something like this (sorry for the example, I don't know it's name): var _gaq = _gaq || []; I understand what it does, but I don't understand how _gaq becomes an object. Any leads? Thanks.
[09:32:14] <jop008> like some css or something
[09:32:15] <jop008> i
[09:32:23] <NoiseEee> jop008: i guess you can calculate if height is larger than width, and then flip ?
[09:32:29] <jop008> there must be a way to do some image formatting
[09:32:31] <RohanBhangui> true
[09:32:43] <jop008> but flip how flip?
[09:32:54] <NoiseEee> jop008: #css ask about rotating an image?
[09:32:58] <NoiseEee> or google?
[09:32:59] <qkzoo> Could the fact that this is jqm have contributed to this behavior?
[09:32:59] <jop008> changing width and height tag you mean
[09:33:32] <BillCriswell> orentanay: array in javascript would be an object.
[09:33:41] <BillCriswell> typeof [] === "object"
[09:33:56] <BillCriswell> I think with the _gaq you're just adding elements to an array
[09:34:19] <RohanBhangui> qkzoo: what behavior
[09:34:47] <jop008> not many people in #css
[09:34:58] <jop008> I googled on it
[09:35:26] <qkzoo> Having to add the type of element to the selector, like "form#frmMine" instead of just "#frmMine" ?
[09:35:33] <NoiseEee> jop008: man, too bad there aren't any google results for "rotate an image with css"
[09:35:38] <NoiseEee> jop008: back to the drawing board
[09:35:52] <jop008> hits but useful hits
[09:36:06] <NoiseEee> good luck.
[09:36:58] <jop008> like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5656164/adding-css-class-according-to-image-ratio-with-javascript-jquery not saying what claass portrait landscape is
[09:37:13] <gho5t> jop008: transform: rotate(@degrees);
[09:37:17] <gho5t> bam
[09:37:29] <NoiseEee> jop008: way to find an answer that has nothing to do with what you're talking about!
[09:38:34] <NoiseEee> jop008: add what gho5t wrote as a definition to those classes and you should be on your way.
[09:39:15] <NoiseEee> jop008: also you should improve your problem solving skills.
[09:39:29] <gho5t> or retire
[09:39:31] <gho5t> : )
[09:39:33] <gho5t> jk
[09:39:44] <RohanBhangui> jks gho5t
[09:39:50] <Bloomberg> Good morning guys!!
[09:39:56] <gho5t> omg hello!
[09:39:59] <Bloomberg> I hope everybody is fine!
[09:40:19] <RohanBhangui> qkzoo: i know im cnfused why it doesnt work but also the googd thing is that if you have a div and h3 anmed notifcations in the id tehy wont be styled the same
[09:41:07] <exalt> hey, ive got a select drop down, i can catch the value with jqeury but i wonder what is the best way to redirect the webpage with a post value ?
[09:41:30] <RohanBhangui> exalt: ist eh select data sensitive
[09:41:34] <RohanBhangui> *the
[09:41:46] <RohanBhangui> then use get
[09:42:13] <exalt> RohanBhangui: doesnt matter get is fine too :)
[09:42:26] <exalt> its an internal system not open for ww
[09:42:29] <RohanBhangui> ge tis faster than post anyways back to main issue
[09:42:33] <exalt> www*
[09:42:54] <RohanBhangui> why dont you use ajax request to avoid page refresh
[09:43:19] <RohanBhangui> neways im out
[09:47:15] <Bloomberg> In my page I'm managing a table with contacts, so In the left side of my page I have a possible filter for search so fast the contacts, so there is a list like friend, job, office, family .etc... and in the middle side of the page is the table with allthe contacts. I'm working with the jtable jquery plugin for show all contacts in the table. but I have a problem. when the page load automatically loads all the contacts,
[09:47:49] <Bloomberg> The problem is that when in my list of left side I click some option it must filter the table according the option selected
[09:47:56] <jop008> css portrait landscape many hits but no hands on example
[09:48:03] <Bloomberg> But doesn't works like I need it
[09:48:10] <Bloomberg> because load all contacts again
[09:49:19] <jop008> is this changing the browser orientation 	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">?
[09:49:19] <NoiseEee> jop008: the answer has been given. scroll the f up
[09:50:20] <jop008> scrolled back but can't find it
[09:50:49] <jop008> you mean this : jop008: transform: rotate(@degrees);
[09:51:49] <NoiseEee> yes.
[09:52:31] <jop008> But same pictrue on the ipad is okay
[09:52:45] <jop008> so I must use it dynamicly ugly code
[09:52:58] <gho5t> ...
[09:53:02] <gho5t> you know that's css right
[09:53:13] <gho5t> switch @degrees with 90 or whatever you want
[09:53:15] <civilordergone> BillCriswell, i ended up resolving the ajax issue by changing the ajax json request, instead of using getJSON, i used .ajax
[09:53:17] <jop008> ugly solutions you mean?
[09:53:21] <gho5t> you're an idiot
[09:53:53] <BillCriswell> civilordergone: Did you eventually get the response headers?
[09:54:10] <BillCriswell> $.getJSON() and $.ajax() are like the same shit, just different options.
[09:54:31] <civilordergone> it just kept returning 0 in the fail catch..
[09:54:45] <Bloomberg> http://pastebin.com/Vn336CTs
[09:54:48] <Bloomberg> that is my problem
[09:54:57] <BillCriswell> civilordergone: What dataType do you have set on the $.ajax call?
[09:55:00] <civilordergone> json
[09:55:29] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell: Can do you help me with my problem ?
[09:55:29] <BillCriswell> Hm.
[09:55:30] <Bloomberg> plz
[09:55:48] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Pretty busy today sadly.
[09:55:51] <civilordergone> yeah.. i have no idea.  i've been using .getJSON for all the other requests
[09:56:17] <Bloomberg> mm..
[09:56:24] <Bloomberg> thank you anyway..
[09:56:34] <BillCriswell> I can only imagine the header not sending the right content type, but if you set it to ajax that should be damn near identical to $.getJSON().
[09:56:35] <Bloomberg> Someone could help me with my problem?
[09:57:06] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: you'd have more luck with a fiddle.
[09:57:32] <pamere> hi everyone
[09:57:39] <pamere> any idea why this doesnt work in ie10
[09:57:40] <pamere> http://jsfiddle.net/magkia/fwZXx/18/
[09:57:48] <Bloomberg> NoiseEee: Is that I'm working with php
[09:57:50] <pamere> it works just fine with mozilla
[09:58:00] <BillCriswell> but if you set dataType to json that should be damn near identical to $.getJSON() *
[09:58:02] <jop008> So I can use degree stuf if h>w than portrait but on iPad device do nothing?
[09:58:14] <civilordergone> BillCriswell, yeah i hope it's not some sort of caching issue on my server because it did work originally with .getJSON until i loaded an extra jquery plugin
[09:58:23] <pamere> http://jsfiddle.net/magkia/fwZXx/22/
[09:58:32] <civilordergone> then it broke..
[09:58:52] <jop008> I don;t know which device is rendering the picture only to see by seeing the page in action
[10:07:42] <pamere> hi any idea why this doesnt work in ie10
[10:07:44] <pamere> http://jsfiddle.net/magkia/fwZXx/22/
[10:08:04] <BillCriswell> pamere: Are there any errors?
[10:08:17] <tpyo> is .append() async?
[10:08:19] <BillCriswell> Also, which part of it doesn't work?
[10:08:23] <BillCriswell> tpyo: No.
[10:08:45] <ajmrsn> .getJSON and .ajax…. which ones use .complete .success .done .fail .error?
[10:08:49] <ajmrsn> did I miss anything?
[10:09:06] <BillCriswell> ajmrsn: Both can.
[10:09:14] <ajmrsn> oh ok
[10:09:45] <ajmrsn> I'm having trouble making a function execute after a .getJSON or .ajax finishes loading its content
[10:10:30] <tpyo> ah, so its not async. okay, any idea why this doesn't appear to work: http://pastebin.com/LTkVpKDN
[10:10:38] <ajmrsn> I have $.getJSON(url, function() { /* stuff */ }).done( function () { run_me(); } );
[10:10:40] <tpyo> the event at the end is not received
[10:10:52] <ajmrsn> but run_me() does not seem to execute
[10:10:55] <pamere> BillCriswell not on the developer console , mo
[10:11:00] <tpyo> its worth noting the thing listening for it is a .js file referenced in the get
[10:11:05] <exalt> what is my error? https://dpaste.de/GKeoT/ alert(data) wont even work ?
[10:11:24] <tpyo> so I figured .append() was async as the event never gets through
[10:11:37] <BillCriswell> exalt: .attr('value'))
[10:12:56] <BillCriswell> ajmrsn: How abotu just $.getJSON(url).done(function(r){ console.log(r); }); ?
[10:13:28] <ajmrsn> BillCriswell: oh it's for ipod, do I alert instead?
[10:13:42] <ajmrsn> using phonegap
[10:13:48] <ajmrsn> so no console.log
[10:13:53] <BillCriswell> ajmrsn: You can do that.
[10:14:05] <ajmrsn> where does it store the log?
[10:14:28] <BillCriswell> ajmrsn: I can hook my phone up to my computer and debug it through safari when I need to.
[10:14:46] <ajmrsn> hm
[10:14:56] <ajmrsn> BillCriswell: what do you use?
[10:14:57] <BillCriswell> You can just try alerting it though.
[10:15:23] <BillCriswell> Safari has something built in.  https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/DebuggingSafarioniPhoneContent/DebuggingSafarioniPhoneContent.html
[10:15:37] <rocky> so let me try a rephrased question - is there a help doc someplace online on how to create inline function documentation for my api's that resembles javadocs.... preferably whatever jquery core uses
[10:16:03] <petey> can anyone help me with this tabbable jquery?
[10:16:05] <petey> http://jsfiddle.net/MgcDU/
[10:16:14] <petey> im pulling the time, if it's before 4, it should switch to another tab
[10:16:32] <petey> but i'm having trouble figuring out how to add <li class="active"> to one, and removing it from the others
[10:16:35] <BillCriswell> tpyo: Not sure why your code wouldn't work.
[10:17:13] <tpyo> well im being funky in the regard that im loading separate .js with the seperate .html I load in
[10:17:21] <tpyo> so I guess its to do with that?
[10:17:32] <tpyo> as opposed to just having all the .js in a big blob
[10:18:29] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/eZ5H5/ is essentially what I think you're doing?
[10:20:18] <tpyo> its a little more tricky
[10:20:27] <tpyo> events is an eventEmitter
[10:20:31] <tpyo> a broker of events
[10:20:45] <tpyo> that subs/sends events out
[10:21:06] <tpyo> so its not a js event per se
[10:21:23] <tpyo> it seems to work if I put a button elsewhere on the page that I press after its loaded
[10:21:32] <tpyo> so I think its a timing/ordering/race condition thing D:
[10:21:52] <tpyo> i.e. my js is not ready to receive the event when it is trigger
[10:21:53] <tpyo> ed
[10:22:28] <BillCriswell> Sounds reasonable. Thinking you'd know better than me.
[10:22:50] <qkzoo> So my ajax form is working okay.  when i press the submit button, the button turns blue (from yellow) and then stays blue, instead of turning back to yellow.  is this a css issue?
[10:23:03] <ajmrsn> BillCriswell: ok it does work
[10:23:31] <veQue> myNumber = 0 or myNumber = '0' ?
[10:23:49] <veQue> i'm trying for non strings
[10:24:07] <BillCriswell> veQue: I'd imagine you just want myNumber = 0
[10:24:31] <ajmrsn> but the function I have executed now loops through $('a').each() and changes .on('tap', function () { } ); for each link that matches $(this).attr('href').match(/^https?/)
[10:24:33] <veQue> ok great, that's the way i got it
[10:25:15] <BillCriswell> ajmrsn: IS that what you want it to do?
[10:25:16] <marcomartins> Hi guys, I've a dropdown from which I want to know it's value. I'm using $('#element').val() to make but it often returns the wrong selected value! from html I can see the correct value selected but an alert just returns the wrong one, any help?
[10:25:46] <ajmrsn> BillCriswell: oh yes, sorry and the problem I forgot to say is that it looks like the loops skips the last 'a' element
[10:26:10] <BillCriswell> marcomartins: Are you sure it's wrong? That should not be wrong... It might be returning the value on the option instead of the option text and it seems wrong?
[10:26:14] <tpyo> I wish, I've been developing for a while but completely new to jquery and javascript
[10:26:15] <ajmrsn> BillCriswell: because the very last link on pages does not open with InAppBrowser
[10:26:22] <tpyo> i have great trouble debugging some of my issues D:
[10:26:48] <jop008> what is a good client sniffer (which device the browser is in)?
[10:27:27] <marcomartins> BillCriswell: yes I am. I want the value of the option, and that is displayed wrong. I'm using javascript to change the selected element before, could that be the problem?
[10:28:14] <jop008> is it possible to ask the top left postion and the bottom right postion?
[10:28:36] <BillCriswell> marcomartins: Not sure I'm following that last thing.
[10:28:37] <jop008> If so you can check how the picture is rendered
[10:29:18] <marcomartins> I have an html select element, to set the selected: selected option on the choice, I'm using js to do it too and then I call the val() to get the value
[10:29:28] <qkzoo> So my ajax form is working okay.  when i press the submit button, the button turns blue (from yellow) and then stays blue, instead of turning back to yellow.  is this a css issue?
[10:30:08] <BillCriswell> marcomartins: Just call $('#someSelect').val('New Value');
[10:30:16] <boytoy_> I'm trying to replace my text truncator's deprecated live() with on(). But at http://jsbin.com/okahum/15/edit -- anybody know why the "read less" part won't work?
[10:30:19] <boytoy_> It worked with live(): http://jsbin.com/okahum/6/edit
[10:32:34] <marcomartins> BillCriswell: where?
[10:32:47] <BillCriswell> How are you trying to SET the value to the select?
[10:34:18] <jop008> $('#element').position()
[10:34:26] <GabrielFiel> hello i got this problem, Uncaught Error: Error calling method on NPObject. but i dont know where is the line to solve the problem
[10:36:05] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: You'd need to do like $parent.on('click', '#read-more', function(){ ... });
[10:36:58] <marcomartins> BillCriswell: I'm putting the selected="selected" on the desired field of the choice list with JS then I call the event "change" to let javascript know I changed, then I have a $("#id").change(function... that tries to read the value, and sometimes the returning value is wrong but between the possible values
[10:37:05] <boytoy_> BillCriswell: thank you so much :)
[10:37:10] <boytoy_> let me work my magic :)
[10:37:15] <boytoy_> or rather your magic :)
[10:38:32] <BillCriswell> marcomartins: Don't do that, instead, just do $('select').val('New Options Value'); I'm thinking you might be adding the selected attribute without removing the old one and jQuery is just picking up the first option with the selected attribute.
[10:38:40] <petey> so i think i have the tabs figured out with the date, but can anyone tell me why the actual content is not showing UP? http://jsfiddle.net/MgcDU/
[10:39:42] <Trudko> Hi guys I am using Jquery tablesorter plugin and I am using to add zebra effect. Because table on which i am using it is hidden i have to use little trick(trigger update more info here:  (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/247305/using-jquery-tablesorter-on-dynamically-modified-table) Problem is after I use it form tag inside of table is moved to different place and submiting of this form...
[10:39:43] <Trudko> ...stops to work. Example is herehttp://jsbin.com/ibanak/2/edit
[10:39:59] <marcomartins> BillCriswell: no, I'm removing the select from one and adding another to the new one
[10:40:27] <BillCriswell> marcomartins: Did you try with just $('select').val('New Value')
[10:40:28] <Trudko> You can see same table twice above without running update and second after running update just check html comment and you can see where and how form tag moved . Why second form isnt working?
[10:40:38] <marcomartins> BillCriswell: let me try
[10:42:21] <blib> any lightweight modals (css+js) for jquery?
[10:43:34] <BillCriswell> blib: http://leanmodal.finelysliced.com.au/ is prety slim
[10:44:11] <jop008> how to get x an y of top and bottom right coordinates?
[10:44:14] <jop008> I use $oel.offset ()
[10:44:29] <jop008> and tried $oel.postion()
[10:45:39] <boytoy_> BillCriswell: should I replace $parent with $('#read-more').parent() or something? am currently at http://jsbin.com/okahum/17/edit
[10:46:19] <marcomartins> BillCriswell: it worked! thanks a lot, I just don't get Why it couldn't read the proper value, any guess?
[10:46:40] <BillCriswell> marcomartins: Something just getting fucked up in the mean time I guess.
[10:47:37] <marcomartins> This is just why I find jquery so hard to deal, sometimes things just don't work and no one know a logic explanation =/
[10:48:26] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: #read-more is always changing, so you can't really apply an event listener to it that way. You'd ideally want to target the <p> tag that the plugin is run on.
[10:48:53] <jop008> So no way to find xy coordinates of an image?
[10:49:13] <BillCriswell> jop008: $img.offset().top and $img.offset().left I believe.
[10:49:27] <boytoy_> Oh I see, nice!
[10:49:47] <jop008> does it work $('#element').position()
[10:49:53] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: There's also an error in the trunk8.js file. So that could be busting things.
[10:50:18] <marcomartins> BillCriswell: again, many thanks!
[10:50:33] <boytoy_> Oh no, there's an error in trunk8??
[10:50:57] * boytoy_ grounds all his planes
[10:50:57] <BillCriswell> jop008: That's for relative to the parent.
[10:50:59] <boytoy_> FUCK
[10:51:35] <snover> i agree so much
[10:52:00] <jop008> $oel.offset() is undefined
[10:52:33] <jop008> I want to determine how the picture is renderd
[10:52:50] <jop008> so I need x bottom and x top
[10:52:59] <BillCriswell> .... what?
[10:53:02] <jop008> and y the same
[10:53:57] <BillCriswell> is $oel hidden?
[10:55:39] <boytoy_> BillCriswell: where did you see that trunk8 error? Perhaps I should report it?
[10:55:54] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: When I click the read-more
[10:56:03] <BillCriswell> At least with the code I Was looking at.
[10:56:12] <boytoy_> Oh right, darn
[10:56:39] <boytoy_> The code has changed slightly: http://jsbin.com/okahum/17/edit -- I set it to $('p').on('click', '#read-more', function() {, that's what you meant right?
[10:57:09] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: What do you expect this to be?
[10:57:35] <BillCriswell> The <p> or the #read-more ?
[10:58:43] <boytoy_> The #read-more I guess?
[10:58:55] <boytoy_> My head hurts
[10:59:08] <Trudko> Hi guys I am using Jquery tablesorter plugin and I am using to add zebra effect. Because table on which i am using it is hidden i have to use little trick(trigger update more info here:  (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/247305/using-jquery-tablesorter-on-dynamically-modified-table) Problem is after I use it form tag inside of table is moved to different place and submiting of this form...

[11:00:02] <boytoy_> BillCriswell: No trunk8 error in jQuery 1.8: http://jsbin.com/okahum/6 which is great news :)

[11:01:17] <jop008> var $oel = $("#checkportrait_1");   alert ($oel[0])
[11:01:27] <BillCriswell> jop008: You're so hard to follow.
[11:01:28] <jop008> $oel exists so $oel[0]
[11:01:56] <jop008> $oel[0] is the dom element or not?
[11:02:02] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[11:02:09] <jop008> it is undefined
[11:02:11] <BillCriswell> How is that related to anything we were just talking about?
[11:02:15] <jop008> but $oel is object
[11:02:44] <amph1bius|ghost> lol
[11:03:29] <jop008> talking about?
[11:03:42] <jop008> I narrowed it down to jquery only
[11:04:11] <jop008> so why is $oel an object and $oel[0] undefined
[11:04:38] <BillCriswell> No one is a psychic.
[11:04:56] <Jabberwock> Is $oel an array?
[11:05:22] <BillCriswell> Jabberwock: Good luck.
[11:05:33] <BillCriswell> jop008: http://jsbin.com/omuzob/1/edit hopefully this helps you understand it a little better
[11:07:03] <NoiseEee> jop008: i guess it has no 0 key / is not an array?
[11:07:28] <boytoy_> BillCriswell: so basically http://jsbin.com/okahum/15/edit from earlier *should* work, but it's probably that trunk8 bug?
[11:07:39] <initself_> argh, i can't wrap my mind around how to toggle 'this' class, not all classes.
[11:07:40] <boytoy_> *please say yes please say yes*
[11:07:56] <BillCriswell> initself_: .toggleClass('this')
[11:09:58] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: Don't think so. Since you're constantly appening #read-more there's no way to apply the event listener without listening through the parent.
[11:11:02] <Trudko> guys anybody ? i found that running table sorter  on table also screws ups form submitin(it doesnt react without error0
[11:15:19] <initself_> BillCriswell: my class is not called 'this'
[11:15:45] <initself_> i'm just talking about a button which toggles a class, but it matches only the class related to the button i just clicked
[11:16:58] <initself_> something like $(this).toggleClass('on');?
[11:17:10] <Neillithan> Hi, I need to know how to prepend multiple elements using jquery.  can somebody help me?
[11:17:14] <initself_> i just dont know that $(this) would be
[11:17:14] <BillCriswell> initself_: Yes.
[11:17:19] * initself_ tries.
[11:17:31] <BillCriswell> initself_: It would be the element that the event is attached to.
[11:17:58] <initself> in that case $(this) is a button?
[11:18:01] <Neillithan> http://pastebin.com/7t2a6b3B <-- this is the jquery script I'm attempting to work with
[11:18:33] <BillCriswell> initself: I don't know without seeing how the event is attached.
[11:19:01] <boytoy_> BillCriswell: I think I see what you mean
[11:19:20] <boytoy_> BillCriswell: So this thing requires a whole new design from the ground up?
[11:19:48] <boytoy_> This code is all from the author's page though at http://jrvis.com/trunk8/
[11:20:20] <BillCriswell> initself: http://jsbin.com/acoxig/1/edit
[11:20:50] <jop008> $oel is a $("#") element
[11:21:04] <jop008> just a plan element
[11:21:43] <BillCriswell> jop008: If that selects something, then $oel[0] will return the DOM element, if it doesn't, then of course it won't.
[11:22:52] <jop008> so $oel is an object but [0] is nothing
[11:23:23] <BillCriswell> I just told you it's the dom element.
[11:23:40] <jop008> yes but is undefined I just told you
[11:24:02] <BillCriswell> Then the selector didn't select anything dude.
[11:24:16] <jop008> why I do have an object
[11:24:21] <boytoy_> BillCriswell: I should have enough to go on. I really need a break though, thanks again!
[11:24:27] <NoiseEee> jop008: learn javascript. good fucking luck.
[11:24:28] <BillCriswell> Welcome. Good luck!
[11:24:35] <jop008> gth
[11:24:35] <NoiseEee> jop008: you're a serious vampire.
[11:25:28] <jop008> you are so professional!
[11:26:54] <BillCriswell> jop008: http://jsbin.com/epowoc/1/edit can't simplify it more than that. Good luck.
[11:32:22] <eN_Joy> a general question: i am using jQuery jPlayer on my site that plays remote mp3 urls, for a particular site, i am always getting `"NetworkError: 403 Forbidden - http://www.example.org/upload_music/7154816.mp3"`, although i have no problem with a browser, with wget, etc to get the file, i understand this has to be related to their site config, but still is there anything that i could do on *my* js file? thanks
[11:33:51] <Trudko> Guys tablesorter disables form in my table after triggering update even on the table , any idea how to handle that?
[11:33:58] <eN_Joy> for example, is there a work around that when jQuery simulates a browser request?
[11:39:26] <iliketurtles> how can I detect when a text-overflow:ellipsis is active on an element, and create a bootstrap tooltip only when this is the case?
[11:43:48] <spacebarbarian> is there a shortcut for matching ascii excluding space in javascript ?
[11:43:53] <spacebarbarian> *regex
[11:45:00] <BillCriswell> iliketurtles: $elements.filter(function(){ return $(this).css('text-overflow') === 'ellipsis' }); I think?
[11:46:44] <BillCriswell> iliketurtles: As for telling if it's actually like... ellipsisized? Not really sure.
[11:46:52] <initself> BillCriswell: i'm not sure if my code is tied to the button like in your example
[11:46:53] <iliketurtles> BillCriswell: that's my issue
[11:47:01] <iliketurtles> i need to know if it HAS been ellipsized
[11:47:07] <BillCriswell> iliketurtles: Ahh.
[11:47:08] <iliketurtles> and only add the tooltip then
[11:47:10] <initself> the button is just sitting inside <td> with the stuff i want to toggle
[11:47:20] <initself> maybe i need something like toggle_nearest_class?
[11:47:46] <BillCriswell> initself: $(this).closest('td').find('.elementToToggle').toggleClass('something') ?
[11:49:34] <pisio>  /msg NickServ identify <password>
[11:49:36] <pisio> ops
[11:49:45] <pisio> what ever ...
[11:49:48] <initself> is toggling a class the same thing as hidding stuff?
[11:49:57] <initself> dont answer that
[11:50:58] <petey> can anyone look over this code please and tell me why the content of the box isn't showing up? just the tabs?
[11:50:59] <petey> http://jsfiddle.net/MgcDU/
[11:51:02] <petey> its been driving me craazy
[11:51:34] <blindMoe> petey: I see the content
[11:51:44] <petey> "im in section one"
[11:51:46] <petey> when you run it though?
[11:51:50] <petey> it dissapears once its run
[11:51:57] <blindMoe> run what?
[11:52:02] <blindMoe> I think you pasted the wrong link
[11:52:06] <blindMoe> there is no JS in this
[11:52:06] <pisio> after i add href="#modal" in  anchor ,  my   click event at $("a[href='#myModal']")  dont  work , why ?
[11:52:24] <Saaether> think you posted the wrong link
[11:52:43] <petey> it didnt save, argh
[11:53:58] <petey> http://jsfiddle.net/MgcDU/6165/
[11:54:14] <blindMoe> wow 6165.. might be the highest I have seen
[11:54:20] <Saaether> 6165 wow thats alot of saves
[11:55:00] <blindMoe> petey:     $('.tab-content').hide();
[11:55:27] <petey> i just figured that should be there so once im changing tabs, the other tabs switch over and dont overlap content or something?
[11:55:48] <blindMoe> petey: http://jsfiddle.net/MgcDU/6166/
[11:55:58] <blindMoe> you are hiding the entire tab container and then trying to show a child in there
[11:56:04] <blindMoe> it won't show up because its' parent is hidden
[11:56:17] <blindMoe> I switched it to this and it works: $('.tab-content .tab-pane').hide();
[11:56:46] <petey> ah yay
[11:56:47] <petey> exciting
[11:56:55] <petey> thanks a lot
[11:57:25] <Saaether> you dont have to do those hides at all, just remove them
[11:57:31] <Saaether> jquery ui handles it for you
[11:57:41] <initself> BillCriswell++ # thank you so so much!
[11:58:00] <blindMoe> yeah not sure why you are manually hiding and unhiding... bootstrap tabs has functions to handle the switching for you
[11:58:04] <pisio> hey team .  why after i add with jquery attribute  at anchor , my code is not working ?
[11:58:10] <pisio> view-source:http://s1.anibox.in/anime/form_add

[11:58:21] <Saaether> err oops ya bootstrap tabs not jqui
[11:58:24] <petey> i only need it for this
[11:58:31] <petey> it doesnt do it for me, i just tried

[11:59:43] <JFranks> if I wanted to change a <span id="foo"></span> into a <p></p> or some other element.. Is there a method in jQuery?
[11:59:56] <petey> but lunch is in section 2, section 1 shows up
[12:00:44] <Saaether> each tab only has 1 section showing up for me, what browser are you using?
[12:01:10] <petey> chrome
[12:01:17] <Saaether> works fine in chrome for me
[12:01:22] <blindMoe> petey: I believe this is what you want: http://jsfiddle.net/MgcDU/6170/
[12:01:24] <petey> you're probably right
[12:01:53] <blindMoe> need to remember that bootstrap is just binding to the click event of that <a> so you can just call the appropriate one and bootstrap will take care of the rest
[12:02:20] <petey> ah cool
[12:02:23] <petey> do more with less, i like it
[12:02:32] <Saaether> oh, just understand what you were saying, ya it wasnt switching tabs
[12:02:42] <Saaether> understood*
[12:02:57] <petey> any decent resources to start expanding my knowledge of jquery?
[12:03:03] <petey> im still fairly new as you can imagine
[12:03:35] <JFranks> Ahh.. .replaceWith()
[12:07:14] <gregtom6> hy all
[12:07:17] <BillCriswell> iliketurtles: this.offsetWidth < this.scrollWidth
[12:07:29] <iliketurtles> BillCriswell: what about if using jQuery?
[12:07:33] <BillCriswell> iliketurtles: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7738117/html-text-overflow-ellipsis-detection bottom answer here.
[12:07:42] <gregtom6> I'm using fullCalendar. How should I hide the events from the calendar?
[12:08:02] <BillCriswell> iliketurtles: $('.whatever').filter(function(){ return this.offsetWidth < this.scrollWidth }).whatever()
[12:08:11] <gregtom6> and how should I color the "day cell" on the calendar what has events declared inside that?
[12:09:08] <BillCriswell> iliketurtles: http://jsbin.com/ogipaq/1/edit
[12:09:13] <iliketurtles> oooh nice
[12:09:16] <iliketurtles> beautiful solution
[12:09:30] <BillCriswell> Yeah. I doubt I could come up with that shit.
[12:09:33] <blib> any recommendations for a small mobile friendly modal that will work with jquery?
[12:10:15] <BillCriswell> iliketurtles: Never even heard of scrollWidth haha
[12:10:22] <iliketurtles> its pure JS no?
[12:10:48] <BillCriswell> That part of it. The .filter() is part of jQuery, as is $.
[12:11:49] <BillCriswell> this.offsetWith and this.scrollWidth is pure js

[12:24:47] <ignacio01> is thissupposed to work? blank.location.href ?
[12:26:29] <iliketurtles> BillCriswell: weird, this works GREAT in console, but in actual code inside document.ready, it misses a bunch of elements
[12:26:50] <iliketurtles> jQuery(".selector").filter(return this.offsetWidth < this.scrollWidth})
[12:27:03] <Dinho> anyone know how to add a different name for each new input created? example: to create new inputs the input name would look like this: 1 inputname inputname2 inputname3? is possible? http://jsfiddle.net/dinho/MPHam/3/
[12:27:08] <Jabberwock> pisio: Just a tip for the designj
[12:27:15] <Jabberwock> It's not fibonachi
[12:27:34] <Jabberwock> I figured since we had a language barrier I could at least offer some design guidance
[12:27:53] <pisio> Tnx.

[12:29:11] <iliketurtles> sorry it looks like this: jQuery(".cb-label.with-tooltips").filter(function(){ return this.offsetWidth < this.scrollWidth })
[12:29:21] <iliketurtles> BillCriswell: ^
[12:29:51] <BillCriswell> iliketurtles: What is in .cb-label ?

[12:31:35] <Trudko> i have to run update because table is hidden and after showing it zebra effect doesnt work
[12:32:01] <ignacio01> ??
[12:32:07] <iliketurtles> BillCriswell: console.log(jQuery(".cb-label.with-tooltips").filter(function(){ return this.offsetWidth < this.scrollWidth }).size()); returns 16 in the console, but 5 when run in my JS file in the app
[12:32:34] <gregtom6> can you advice me a calendar like fullcalendar?
[12:32:43] <gregtom6> fullcalendar is bad, I can't do one thing in that
[12:32:45] <BillCriswell> You might have to run it on document ready.
[12:32:50] <iliketurtles> BillCriswell: I am! hehe
[12:33:04] <clov3r> fullcalendar is awesome gregtom6
[12:33:06] <clov3r> imho
[12:33:08] <clov3r> :P
[12:33:12] <clov3r> but what are you trying to do?
[12:33:15] <gregtom6> clov3r: I can't color a day
[12:33:27] <clov3r> css selectors?
[12:33:48] <gregtom6> clov3r: I would like to color a day and hide all of the events
[12:34:01] <gregtom6> so I could see from the color that the day has events
[12:34:17] <gregtom6> I click on the certain day and see what events are inside that
[12:34:21] <gregtom6> I would like to do this
[12:34:34] <clov3r> heh
[12:34:40] <clov3r> i did almost exactly that
[12:34:51] <gregtom6> clov3r: can you help me in this?
[12:34:59] <BillCriswell> iliketurtles: Is the page live? Or can you duplicate it?
[12:35:26] <BillCriswell> duplicate the issue*
[12:37:13] <BillCriswell> iliketurtles: Are you adding the elements after the page is loaded? Etc.
[12:38:02] <iliketurtles> BillCriswell:  yeah, there's a fair amount of ajaxy stuff going on
[12:38:11] <BillCriswell> iliketurtles: That would be the issue then.
[12:38:26] <BillCriswell> You'd need to run that code after ajaxy shit happens.
[12:38:44] <BillCriswell> I've been watching too much Trailer Park Boys, saying "shit" way too much.

[12:39:36] <Dinho> How to increment values on .clone() in jquery ?   http://jsfiddle.net/dinho/MPHam/3/
[12:43:38] <NoiseEee> Dinho: the same way you would if it was just a regular element
[12:44:24] <aldodelgado> How can I select the data-attributes of a select option. I can get the select but not the option.
[12:45:11] <petey> who was asking about that modal earlier? have you heard of http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/
[12:46:45] <aldodelgado> Never mind :-) find(':selected').
[12:46:53] <Trudko> Guys after running jquery table sorert update event form inside of my  table doesnt work. i have to run update because table is hidden(display:none) and after showing it zebra effect doesnt work. Wtf
[12:46:59] <NoiseEee> aldodelgado: $('#selectElement option:selected').attr('data-whatever')
[12:47:41] <aldodelgado> NoiseEee: I came up with this, $(this).find(':selected').attr('data-phone')
[12:48:22] <Dinho> could help me.?
[12:48:33] <NoiseEee> aldodelgado: fair enough, i'd add "option" before :selected just so its not looking at every element
[12:48:48] <NoiseEee> Dinho: increment what?
[12:48:59] <aldodelgado> NoiseEee: Fair enough I'll make that change
[12:49:23] <NoiseEee> aldodelgado: then again, if this is the <select> element it shouldn't matter
[12:49:38] <aldodelgado> NoiseEee: it is
[12:50:49] <Dinho> could help me.? necessary that each new inpout has an id diferent for me save in the database eg the name field by clicking + it adds the id field name1 and name2 add a new
[12:51:12] <Dinho> http://jsfiddle.net/dinho/MPHam/5/
[12:51:24] <Dinho> new inputs , new ids
[12:52:43] <Dinho> I am not able to put a different id for each input set
[12:55:06] <Dinho> to create new field like that new fields have an id sequential type: cpf1 nome1   /    cpf2   nome2  / cpf3 nome3....
[12:55:45] <NoiseEee> Dinho: first of all, you might want to just have all the names "cpf[]" and "nome[]"
[12:56:17] <NoiseEee> Dinho: that way an array is created on your backend/processor (most likely, ie: php)
[12:56:46] <NoiseEee> Dinho: if you want to explicitly change anything, then do it like a normal element.    li.prop('id',newID)
[12:57:22] <NoiseEee> li.find.input.first().prop('name','someName'); etc
[12:57:24] <NoiseEee> good luck :)
[12:57:44] <Dinho> noise'm php programmer, could help me in this file http://jsfiddle.net/dinho/MPHam/5/?
[12:58:01] <NoiseEee> Dinho: dude I *just* helped you.
[12:59:04] <NoiseEee> and again, its wiser to use <input name="cpf[]"> than a bunch of: name="cpf1" name="cpf2", because that way you can iterate on the backend: foreach($_POST['cpf'] as $key=>$value) { //etc ##php }
[12:59:41] <NoiseEee> and you can clone those inputs without changing a thing (besides setting values to '' if you like)
[13:01:46] <Dinho> Thank you. I'll try here. not sure I understand. but I appreciate your help. thank you. NoiseEee
[13:02:56] <NoiseEee> Dinho: no problem.  it'll probably make more sense if you just make a simple form with a few <input name='someName[]'>, fill in some values, then examine what PHP gets in $_POST['someName']
[13:05:29] <Quest> hi
[13:05:35] <Dinho> I just need to be created with the imputs ids diferents
[13:05:47] <Quest> who are the most experts here in jquery and css?
[13:06:24] <NoiseEee> Dinho: but what i'm saying is, you really don't
[13:07:04] <NoiseEee> Dinho: *especially* if the numbers in your names (input1, input2) don't mean anything / only serve to distinguish the inputs
[13:07:58] <okdamn> hi, anyone familiar with jquery-ajax-progress ?
[13:08:15] <okdamn> ever used?
[13:08:16] <NoiseEee> Dinho: giving all the inputs a name like "someName[]"   (the []) creates an array of inputs in PHP / distinguishes each one
[13:08:46] <okdamn> can someone help me 1 moment on this https://github.com/englercj/jquery-ajax-progress/ ?
[13:09:15] <okdamn> i installed and it works great but i got a little problem

[13:53:10] <eN_Joy> a general question (updated): i am using jQuery jPlayer on my site that plays remote mp3 urls, for a particular site, i am always getting `"NetworkError: 403 Forbidden - http://www.example.org/upload_music/7154816.mp3"`, although i have no problem with a browser, with wget, etc to get the file, i understand this has to be related to their site config, but still is there anything that i could do on *my* js file? what i can see is that the jPlayer is sen
[13:53:25] <Pieter> So how do I get around it
[13:53:40] <eN_Joy> question also posted on SO: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17819128/jquery-jplayer-play-remote-url-networkerror-403-forbidden

[14:13:10] <oste> anyone know how to know if an element is scrolled all the way to the right
[14:13:29] <oste> if $(this).scrollLeft() == 0
[14:13:40] <oste> that will tell if the element is scrolled all the way left
[14:13:46] <oste> i need the opposite(right)
[14:26:46] <ASUchander> Whenever I try to do this : $('a.jobs-refresh').trigger('click'); I get a "TypeError: Illegal Invocation" error. - any ideas as to why this would be?
[14:27:31] <BillCriswell> Post your code to a fiddle or something.
[14:28:20] <ASUchander> BillCriswell: It's just $('a.jobs-refresh').trigger('click'); in the jquery console
[14:28:26] <ASUchander> Browser console that is
[14:28:42] <BillCriswell> Yeah, but what does the event look like?
[14:29:03] <BillCriswell> Or are you just trying to do a click on a regular link?
[14:29:31] <ASUchander> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/faaef534b83b5dbace90  <-- It's complicated, but it runs fine when the page loads
[14:29:50] <ASUchander> And the interval refresh of it works fine also.
[14:33:32] <Oramz> I'm new here.  Is this strictly IRC 40-56?
[14:34:15] <BillCriswell> Don't know what that means Oramz.
[14:34:17] <ASUchander> I'm not sure what "40-56" means?
[14:34:22] <ASUchander> This is IRC :-)
[14:34:45] <santos> hi
[14:34:57] <BillCriswell> ASUchander: is this. instead of jobs.fetch what you expect it to be?
[14:35:15] <BillCriswell> inside of*
[14:35:52] <santos> I have a problem I am not able to solve: I created a jquery dialog that pops up on a special event. But when the browser window is minimized I have no chance to see it. Is there a way to solve it? Maybe pop up the browser window?
[14:36:02] <Oramz> Maybe i'm in the wrong IRC... What does IRC stand for here?
[14:36:06] <ASUchander> BillCriswell: yep, the success function needs "that" (since it's a callback) but this is defined and in scope in the fetch() part
[14:37:20] <sparr> I want to assign a click() event to an element with some variable action based on the contents of a variable when the event is assigned.
[14:37:23] <BillCriswell> ASUchander: Do you mean to end jobs.fetch when you do?
[14:37:29] <sparr> How can I do that, instead of evaluating the variable when the event triggers?
[14:37:46] <ASUchander> BillCriswell: Yes.
[14:38:11] <BillCriswell> I was reading that wrong.
[14:38:12] <ASUchander> jobs is a Backbone collection - if that helps
[14:38:59] <ASUchander> BillCriswell: oddly enough, the only case where this doesn't work is the click event...it gets called by setTimeout and works fine, gets called via backbone and is fine, etc.  Just the click that gives me the illegal invocation
[14:39:53] <ASUchander> It does that both when I use the trigger() method, as well as if I click on a link - so I agree with you that it's the callback that is going wrong.  I'm just at a loss as to where
[14:40:23] <BillCriswell> ASUchander: Ah, duh.
[14:40:27] <BillCriswell> Think I see it.
[14:40:38] <BillCriswell> function(jobs){ } when it's already defined?
[14:40:56] <BillCriswell> For the success
[14:41:05] <ASUchander> Hmm..I'll try to change that and see what happens.
[14:41:34] <ASUchander> Nope, same error.
[14:43:00] <Logitec> Hello fellow jQuery users, I'm having an issue with my document.ready being called after the 'change' event has been fired on an 'input' field, any idea why this happens or how to prevent it?
[14:44:21] <ASUchander> Logitec: you mean that someone is modifying the field before the document completes loading?
[14:44:51] <ASUchander> If your change event depends on the entire document being loaded, you might not attach the event until the document is loaded?
[14:45:43] <BillCriswell> What is success returning? I'm assuming some json?
[14:46:10] <NaOH> in jquery mobile, can i stop the page hide event from occuring (closing a dialog) in the pagebeforehide event?
[14:46:58] <ASUchander> BillCriswell: It returns nothing
[14:46:59] <Logitec> ASUchander: It doesn't depend on the entire document, it's just registered in the document.ready function. It executes all the code in my document.ready after submit/change of the input field
[14:47:42] <BillCriswell> ASUchander: What is it there?
[14:48:08] <BillCriswell> I don't mean return. I mean why is it being passed "jobs" ?
[14:48:49] <ASUchander> jobs is a Backbone.js collection - it uses it to populate some underscore templates
[14:49:48] <BillCriswell> What if you do console.log( jobs ) in success, is that what you expect?
[14:50:50] <Logitec> I expect document.ready to load ONCE at the absolutely first time loading the page, never again afterwards, is there another way to achieve this without using document.ready?
[14:56:47] <rbs> I have a model (Case) that is opened by 1 Professional (model) and worked by another Professional, so my model Case, belongsTo 2 different Professionals, so I have created to fields on my Cases, scheduled and worked, I did belongsTo('Professionals', 'scheduled') and belongsTo('Professionals', 'worked')
[14:57:02] <rbs> but when i call it it just brings me the integer value, instead of the professional object
[14:57:06] <rbs> what would be wrong?
[14:57:34] <rbs> the inverse works... I set hasMany('Cases', 'scheduled') and 'worked' on professionals and I can bring the Cases list
[14:57:39] <BillCriswell> rbs: Mean to ask that in jQuery?
[14:57:45] <rbs> lol
[14:57:49] <rbs> wrong # sorry
[15:01:40] <Logitec> Seriously, why is it executing my whole Javascript again after submit/change of an INPUT field?
[15:20:14] <apneic> Hi I have a question about jquery and browser cache (maybe).  I have a button on my website, and I dynamically modify the post url of that button based on actions that a user takes on that page.  So if they select another item from a dropdown list, the id in the post url might change.  I've found that this works fine, and I can submit the form to the correct url.  But pressing the back button afterwards provides a cached version of the page before the jquery cha
[15:20:14] <apneic> were made.
[15:20:31] <apneic> So if they press Back and then submit immediately, they submit to a different url
[15:20:44] <apneic> Is there any way I can correct this?  Maybe by updating the cached version of the page for the user?

[16:13:15] <Lettro_> hi
[16:13:40] <jeremy-> I have a jquery autocomplete field that a user can select from. I also want to be able to programmatically fill that value by settings its value with .val(var)
[16:13:52] <jeremy-> How can i set the value of jquery ui autocomplete with .val(var) without triggering the autocomplete
[16:15:40] <jeremy-> I suppose one way to do it would be to disable then enable the autocomplete inbetween setter, surely theres a better way
[16:16:50] <Lettro_> i'm think about it...
[16:19:56] <jeremy-> errr, perhaps ignore that, its another issue. im not sure that setting .val() triggers my event.
[17:03:32] <RonWhoCares> I am trying to setup a jQuery RelatedSelects .  I have pasted the code @ http://jsfiddle.net/FmF34/    I am not sure how to include RelatedSelects

[17:17:40] <EdenK> u load the jquery library?
[17:17:53] <retran> "doesn't work"
[17:18:05] <tw2113> i would guess because ready() isn't chainable
[17:18:09] <retran> someone make the bot give the "doesn't work" speech
[17:18:23] <tw2113> plus it'd be ,ready().click even if it was
[17:18:37] <EdenK> jQuery(document).ready(function( $ ) {
[17:18:43] <tw2113> ^
[17:20:56] <adamsilver> then how some people are doing it? what i am trying to do is opening an external url on the first click on my page? i heard this is the only guaranteed way launch a popup these days...
[17:25:44] <RonWhoCares> Would someone be able to help me with the Related Selects problem?  What I am struggling with is why Related Selects isn't triggered when the "area of portal" is changed http://jsfiddle.net/FmF34/

[19:41:17] <ernston> how can i change : $(document).on("click", "#addurl", function(e, data) {
[19:41:18] <ernston> so that only click on the #addurl button triggers the function
[19:43:36] <DarkGhost`> ernston $("#addurl").click(function(e,data) { }); ?
[19:45:04] <ernston> no working :s

[19:46:32] <ernston> really?

[19:56:39] <ernston> if: <span class=​"shopid">​0​</span>​

[19:56:55] <ernston> instead of "0"
[19:58:06] <miketaylr> ernston: because .val is for form elements
[19:58:28] <ernston> oh bloody hell
[19:58:49] <miketaylr> you're probably looking for .text()
