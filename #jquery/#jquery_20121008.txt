[00:00:14] <jvm_> hi. i opened a ticket, reporting a bug i already fixed for myself, though not well, i guess. i am being asked to provide a test case. now i am fiddling around with jsfiddle, and can't even make it do anything. can someone help me getting my sliders with jquery-ui working? i would be very thankful for the lesson. http://jsfiddle.net/EgSA6/
[00:16:02] <dthree> Hi, one question, how can i get the selected item of a "select object"?
[00:16:33] <dthree> i make $('#selectid option:selected).val(), but now, i have the object, not the id.
[00:18:35] <Milos> $('#selectid option:selected').attr('id')
[00:18:42] <Milos> I think.
[00:18:46] <Milos> If I understood correctly.
[00:23:20] <jvm_> dthree, <select><option value="123">text</option></select> -- only the value should concern you. and you get it with .val(). use the value as the id that links to all other data you need.
[00:26:04] <jvm_> dthree, sorry. note that you use the .val() on the select object, to get the selected value. i.e. $("#selectid").val(). if you care about the text, not the value attribute, you could always get it with $("#selectid option[id='whatever']").html().
[00:26:54] <dthree> jvm_:  can i get the id of selected item easy form?
[00:27:04] <blackspotwiggins> jvm_, it seems you are not including jquery in the jsfiddle testcase
[00:27:07] <blackspotwiggins> jquery ui*
[00:28:08] <jvm_> blackspotwiggins, i added it as a resource?
[00:28:19] <blackspotwiggins> ah, didnt notice
[00:28:52] <jvm_> dthree, the value tag of the option is supposed to be the id you identify it with. the order of the option tags should not matter, and not affect your programming logic.
[00:30:09] <dthree> jvm_:  other question: i have object "button", why when i try to make obj.prev() say me: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLButtonElement> has no method 'prev'  ?
[00:30:37] <jvm_> dthree, try $(obj).prev()?
[00:30:49] <dthree> omg jvm_, i forget $( ) :(
[00:31:02] <jvm_> everyone does :p
[00:32:05] <dthree> im an idiot xD
[00:32:17] <dthree> RELOL
[00:32:30] <dthree> jvm_:  thanks for your help :D
[00:32:48] <jvm_> dthree, Milos gave you a solution to access other attributes of the selected option tag. just telling you that the value attribute of the option tag is what is transferred on a form submit request, and is supposed to be the id of that option.
[00:33:10] <jvm_> have a nice day.
[00:33:57] <dthree> jvm_:  thz :D
[00:34:03] <dthree> have a nice day u too
[00:34:06] <angelazou> Need a little help with a snippet
[00:34:13] <angelazou> here http://jsbin.com/ixihej/4/edit
[00:34:25] <angelazou> I need to replace the placeholder * with an object
[00:34:39] <angelazou> tried to use replace function, but then all I see is [object Object]
[00:34:46] <angelazou> rather than the content of the object
[00:35:24] <chord> tw2113: so you an apple fanboy of ihpone 4s
[00:35:55] <blackspotwiggins> jvm_, http://jsfiddle.net/EgSA6/1/
[00:35:58] <blackspotwiggins> css as well :)
[00:37:24] <jvm_> blackspotwiggins, thanks a lot!
[00:39:42] <Lucky--> in js what does !! mean?
[00:39:51] <Lucky--> lol noob question for soemone doing node code
[00:39:52] <angelazou> evaluating boolean value
[00:40:06] <Lucky--> ah
[00:40:09] <Lucky--> like a string to bool
[00:40:13] <angelazou> yes
[00:40:24] <Lucky--> cool. thx.
[00:40:26] <angelazou> tell you the boolean value of a variable/object
[00:40:29] <angelazou> np
[00:40:54] <Lucky--> so if i had 'true' or 1 or ran some func it would coalesce it to bool
[00:41:33] <angelazou> yes
[00:41:38] <angelazou> but it's not that useful
[00:41:53] <angelazou> because most of the time, when you have an expression, it'll evaluate that for you
[00:41:55] <Lucky--> yea im looking at a lib of how someone structured a SPA
[00:41:58] <Lucky--> and wondering why these did it
[00:42:02] <Lucky--> yea
[00:42:05] <Lucky--> *why they
[00:42:33] <angelazou> no idea, never had a use case on this operator myself
[00:42:48] <Lucky--> basically they set a route confic file up for sammy.js and its reading the routes in as an array and registering em and one of the closure's values is isDefault which is true
[00:43:41] <angelazou> sounds interesting
[00:44:02] <angelazou> but did you mention node.js?
[00:44:33] <blackspotwiggins> Lucky--, angelazou !!"true" and !!"false" are both true
[00:44:42] <go1010> Hello
[00:44:59] <angelazou> sure it does
[00:45:05] <angelazou> "false" is not an empty string
[00:45:33] <angelazou> so it evaluates to true
[00:45:48] <boulet101010_> hellno go1010
[00:46:10] <angelazou> blackspotwiggins: can you help me with my snippet?
[00:46:36] <blackspotwiggins> a sec
[00:47:38] <Milos> Does anyone know how I can select all elements of type x *after* element y?
[00:47:41] <Milos> i.e.
[00:47:58] <Milos> I want to select all elements that have a certain class, but they have to be systematically after element y.
[00:48:24] <blackspotwiggins> angelazou, that's because you replace with a jquery object
[00:48:55] <angelazou> blackspotwiggins: I know it's an object, but I need to replace the * placeholder with that object
[00:48:58] <angelazou> how do I do it?
[00:49:03] <fRAiLtY-> Morning guys, having a major issue with this script: http://jsfiddle.net/fRAiLtY/F4Nbf/ The idea is to skip weekends and dates in the array when checkDate() is called. It works for the first weekend, so for example it skips the upcoming weekend but after that it doesn't :x It also "changes" how it works later in the week, i.e. on a Friday it doesn't work at all, and I'm confused :x
[00:49:31] <blackspotwiggins> as in replace * with the html?
[00:49:36] <blackspotwiggins> .replace() does string replace
[00:50:06] <angelazou> Milos: y+x[class=CLASSNAME]
[00:50:08] <AdamPDotty> Milos: divA + divB
[00:50:16] <Milos> o-o
[00:50:32] <Milos> :O
[00:50:35] <Milos> you mean like
[00:50:37] <angelazou> blackspotwiggins:  yes
[00:50:43] <Milos> $('y+x[class=CLASSNAME]') ?
[00:50:52] <angelazou> Milos: yes
[00:50:57] <Milos> that's sexy
[00:51:02] <AdamPDotty> Ã¤hhm
[00:51:03] <angelazou> ...
[00:51:25] <AdamPDotty> [class=ClassName] === .ClassName
[00:51:27] <Milos> thanks a lot
[00:52:00] <blackspotwiggins> angelazou, i'd use different markup, wrap the * in a span or smth and use replace() on that
[00:52:01] <angelazou> blackspotwiggins: so how do I make the replacement happen?
[00:52:02] <blackspotwiggins> jquery not string
[00:52:28] <angelazou> the content in the object are actually dynamically created
[00:52:36] <go1010> Hello i just found some bug in jquery i think so the question is really difficult but basically i have a div that is closed then when clicking on reply button it opens, the problem is when using infinite scroll the more down i go the more times the div opens and closes o.0 this is what i have for that short part of code for that div http://jsfiddle.net/fpG3E/
[00:52:41] <angelazou> or is there a way to convert them to strings?
[00:52:48] <angelazou> maybe object.html()?
[00:52:53] <go1010> any help would be awesome
[00:54:27] <shoky> go1010: when you're doing:  $(this).nextAll('.message_area_reply')[0]
[00:54:39] <shoky> go1010: what do you think 'this' is?
[00:54:59] <blackspotwiggins> angelazou, that's a possibility
[00:55:08] <shoky> cause it'll be the same element as in the previous $(this) on that same line
[00:55:44] <go1010> but the thing is
[00:56:15] <go1010> that its not just one div with the reply button it depends how many comments so it can be x amount of it
[00:56:27] <go1010> then when somone click i just want to have that one open
[00:56:34] <go1010> but not all of them
[00:56:39] <go1010> and the this prevents that
[00:56:43] <shoky> 'but the thing is'?
[00:56:47] <dthree> how can i get deteminate type of objet, for example if i use nextall or prevall y want to get the unique select objet in the list of objet that return
[00:56:47] <shoky> i just asked a simple question
[00:58:02] <go1010> shoky not really sure how to fix this
[00:58:10] <shoky> go1010: you want the "closest" .message_area_reply  and that area's next .message_area_reply too, right
[00:58:33] <go1010> yes basically any random one the use is gonna choose
[00:58:55] <go1010> they have to be tottaly seperated so each one wokrs on its own
[00:59:10] <angelazou> blackspotwiggins: thanks, got it working
[00:59:27] <go1010> now it works but only when the infinite scroll isnt reacting
[00:59:38] <go1010> as soon as more contennt loads
[00:59:50] <go1010> the more times that div is cloing and openeing
[01:00:02] <go1010> so  it can do this like 20 times in a row
[01:00:06] <go1010> without stopping
[01:00:08] <shoky> go1010: i think you meant: http://jsfiddle.net/fpG3E/1/
[01:00:18] <go1010> ok give me one moment
[01:00:26] <shoky> either way, would have to see a proper working fiddle to help further
[01:00:30] <zsoc> is there a server side-type equivalent for != in jquery? .not() does not seem to work exactly the same. Or do I just have to write if/else conditionals backwards?
[01:00:57] <shoky> zsoc: what do you wanna check
[01:01:10] <zsoc> shoky, in this particular instance, the opposite of hasClass
[01:01:21] <shoky> use !
[01:01:23] <shoky> ?
[01:01:24] <zsoc> oh
[01:01:51] <zsoc> i guess i'm confused by the syntax then.. where exactly do I place the exception?
[01:02:08] <shoky> if ( !something.hasClass('clazz') ) { ... }
[01:02:23] <zsoc> oh, on the identifier
[01:02:36] <zsoc> or rather the alias.. so like !$
[01:02:44] <shoky> ye
[01:02:49] <zsoc> nifty, ty
[01:02:59] <xec_> zsoc: .not() is the same as .filter(), only opposite
[01:03:13] <zsoc> xec, oh, that explains a bit
[01:06:46] <zsoc> hmm.. so then if i'm looking for not this, I should literally be using something.not(this)
[01:09:02] <zsoc> ugh wait... so if I do if( $(".product_div").not(this) ) { } ... the "this" in the if statements BECOMES what was selected as .not(this)?, so everything BUT 'this' in the scope above the if conditional?
[01:09:28] <shoky> .not doesn't return a boolean
[01:09:34] <shoky> it's a filter
[01:09:41] <zsoc> oh
[01:09:44] <zsoc> so i can't if
[01:09:46] <zsoc> hmm
[01:10:11] <zsoc> shoky, so !$(".product_div", this)?
[01:10:29] <shoky> if ( ! $(this).hasClass('product_div') )
[01:10:42] <go1010> shoky the button reply is not working at all now, any more ideas?
[01:11:00] <shoky> go1010: can't help without a working fiddle demonstrating the prob
[01:11:06] <zsoc> shoky, ok.. isn't (".product_div", this) just shorthand for this.hasclass?
[01:11:30] <shoky> zsoc: no, it's shorthand for $(this).find(".product_div")
[01:11:42] <zsoc> shoky, ah.. i am learning a lot today ha. thank you again
[01:11:47] <go1010> i see hmm
[01:12:23] <shoky> zsoc: you could also do:  if ( !$(this).is('.product_div') )
[01:12:46] <zsoc> interesting.. any functional differentiation?
[01:13:12] <BinaryKitten> .is does more checks
[01:13:22] <shoky> that's performance difference, not functional
[01:13:27] <zsoc> gotcha
[01:13:27] <BinaryKitten> it allows for checks against anything
[01:14:10] <BinaryKitten> that is a functional difference. If there was no functional difference between .hasClass and .is  there would only be one or the other, not both
[01:14:31] <zsoc> Ok wait, this doesn't seem right.
[01:14:54] <zsoc> shoky, I am trying to find all elements with .product_div that ARE NOT (this)
[01:15:08] <zsoc> !$(this).hasClass('.product_div') seems like it would check that this does not have that class
[01:15:11] <shoky> of course there's functional difference between .hasClass and .is
[01:15:20] <shoky> but not between .hasClass('bla') and .is('.bla')
[01:15:41] <shoky> which is what i thought the question was about
[01:16:11] <shoky> zsoc:  $('.product_div').not(this)
[01:16:38] <zsoc> shoky, so we're back to .not() ... but it doesn't return a boolean i thought?
[01:16:50] <shoky> you just said you dont want a boolean
[01:16:59] <zsoc> if ($('.product_div').not(this)) {} works then?
[01:16:59] <shoky> but you want to find all elements with some criteria
[01:17:02] <shoky> no :\
[01:17:03] <xec_> zsoc: why would you want a boolean if you want to select elements
[01:17:06] <shoky> decide what you want
[01:17:14] * zsoc ponders carefully
[01:17:18] <shoky> a boolean? or to find all elements that X,Y,Z ?!
[01:17:21] <zsoc> I see.
[01:17:50] <zsoc> Selectors are a bit of a foreign concept to me. I get it now. Thanks :)
[01:19:50] <anli> Is there a way to prenumerate for dom inclusions of elements with a certain class?
[01:20:12] <shoky> is that a word?
[01:20:32] <anli> sorry, subscribe
[01:20:37] <anli> :)
[01:20:55] <shoky> no it's fine, i was just asking ;]
[01:21:36] <shoky> there's no good way to do that really, today, afaik
[01:22:15] <anli> Maybe asp.net sends an event when a "partial view" has been included

[01:24:36] <toxz> hi! can somebody help me getting my datepicker back to work after an body update? example: http://jsfiddle.net/Yhbuv/
[01:31:50] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: i don't understand your 'weeks' variable & calculation.. how is that supposed to skip weekends..?
[01:32:16] <fRAiLtY-> shoky:  I'll be honest, I didn't write that part so I don't know
[01:32:37] <fRAiLtY-> I wrote an incredibly long-winded version and it was modded by Cork to get it much shorter. It seemed to work at first now it don't
[01:32:46] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: it seems to be missing the whole part about skipping weekends..
[01:32:46] <fRAiLtY-> I'm a little bit stuck :x
[01:33:01] <fRAiLtY-> But it skips weekends this week, so for example checkdate(5) skips to Monday
[01:33:04] <fRAiLtY-> ignores the weekends
[01:33:09] <fRAiLtY-> But the following weekend doesn't :x
[01:33:19] <shoky> so?
[01:35:38] <zsoc> oh gracious my head hurts
[01:35:56] <fRAiLtY-> shoky:  ?
[01:36:15] <fRAiLtY-> It skips the first weekend, but not subsequent ones, so I'm guessing it's the Math line that's wrong ?
[01:39:55] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: i guess so too..
[01:40:14] <shoky> like i said, it's missing that whole part
[01:40:29] <fRAiLtY-> So at no point does it check for weekends?
[01:41:30] <shoky> that weeks line is doing something, i'm not sure what. but checking for weekends is not so simple as one small calculation
[01:42:23] <shoky> hm
[01:44:30] <shoky> sorry donno why i thought it cant be simple
[01:46:11] <fRAiLtY-> It is simple?
[01:50:08] <ciurkut> 2 questions. 1 how to include jquery from inside of script?
[01:50:10] <zsoc> is "this.id" ok or would i have to do something like $(this).attr("id") ? I'm looking to insert the current selected element's id into a .html("") function
[01:50:52] <ciurkut> 2 will i break jquery if i load 2 instances on one site?
[01:51:23] <zsoc> ciurkut, both of those things seem avoidable from a serverside language perspective
[01:51:50] <ciurkut> But i have to do that :<
[01:52:08] <zsoc> load jquery twice? i see no circumstance where that is necessary
[01:52:12] <ciurkut> Bookmarklet thingy
[01:52:45] <ciurkut> Or somehow check ifits already there
[01:53:13] <ciurkut> And than add
[01:53:44] <zsoc> jquery in bookmarlet doesn't seem like a great idea... what if jquery is aliased
[01:55:43] <ciurkut> So its better to write all in pure js?
[01:56:33] <zsoc> not my area of expertise
[01:58:30] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: http://jsfiddle.net/F4Nbf/2/
[01:59:20] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: tho it wouldn't work good if a bank holiday was on friday
[01:59:24] <shoky> i think
[01:59:30] <fRAiLtY-> That's what I thought :x
[01:59:33] <fRAiLtY-> Another issue
[01:59:41] <fRAiLtY-> And presumably if the bank holiday is a monday it won't work either?
[01:59:52] <fRAiLtY-> As it will skip the weekend and just return the monday?
[01:59:52] <shoky> mm that should work fine
[02:00:01] <shoky> no, it checks weekend before the holidays
[02:00:18] <fRAiLtY-> So what about the friday? it would return the Saturday you think?
[02:00:28] <shoky> yep
[02:00:50] <fRAiLtY-> Damn
[02:01:57] <shoky> you'll need another loop
[02:02:31] <shoky> that keeps checking if you reached a valid date, if not it advances it and reloops

[02:15:57] <Sandra> Im trying to append som images after i checked the size of another image (its a chat function). http://jsfiddle.net/CEAU4/29/ .. but it seems in some IE8/7 the image that it checks returns 0 .. Anyone know what could be wrong? Or how i could prevent this from happening?
[02:17:09] <shoky> Sandra: two tips, no idea if they'll help:  set the .onload before setting the .src
[02:17:22] <shoky> Sandra: and  try img.width instead of this.width
[02:18:17] <Sandra> shoky: Aah, ok.. will try that out :) Thanks
[02:20:51] <Sandra> shoky: It seems I cant set the .onload before setting the .src .. but ill try check if there was any difference with the img.width / this.width :)
[02:47:22] <Sandra> It seesm that the alrt returns the right number of the image-size .. but yet it goes for the } else { in the code.. it makes no sence :(
[02:48:27] <wfq> hi guys
[02:49:33] <wfq> what is the best way to loand an external page (no part of the corporative website but part of the system as a whole) on a floating windows darkening the background via using jquery? dialog?
[02:58:06] <wfq> just found jquery tools
[03:24:41] <Aamir> ?load @wfq
[03:24:43] <Guest3103> wfq, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[03:24:54] <Aamir> http://api.jquery.com/load/
[03:26:31] <Solet> i'm having a hard time making multiple elements (with the same class) that are generated -after- document is loaded be both draggable and resizable. they all stay draggable but only the most recently made is resizable
[04:10:24] <wfq> guys do I need to use an iframe to load an external page?
[04:12:49] <Xtrivity> Hey guys - i'm trying to work on a background preloader - here's what I have so far but this only preloads a image - not a backgrounce css image. http://pastebin.com/uuC1AKgc
[04:13:03] <Xtrivity> can someone help me understand what I could do to preload a background image
[04:14:39] <Xtrivity> I've tried adding a background class. which works essentially but does not preload anything
[04:16:13] <wfq> is there possible to load an external page (external url) within a div on your page?
[04:16:59] <Xtrivity> wfq: aka ajax? - essentially all the code in my pastebin is all I have so far haha.
[04:17:26] <Xtrivity> oh -- you weren't referring to helping answer my question.
[04:17:53] <Xtrivity> wfq - you can use ajax or htmlgetcontents or iframes to accomplish what you're talking about.
[04:18:20] <wfq> Xtrivity, I don't want an ajax page, I just want to load for exapmle bbc.co.uk when a button is clicked into adiv
[04:18:48] <wfq> regarding to your query, you need to create a java object with the url of the images and include such file to your html
[04:18:50] <Solet> you will run into css errors out the butt
[04:18:53] <wfq> the images will load first
[04:19:11] <wfq> Solet, why? I am loading the whole page at once
[04:19:26] <wfq> as if it was another browser page
[04:19:31] <Xtrivity> wfq load it in an iframe inside a div.
[04:19:36] <Solet> thats what iframe does
[04:19:57] <wfq> I have tried an iframe but it doesn't seem to work
[04:20:05] <Xtrivity> !google iframe
[04:20:24] <Solet> with a div you will pass on hierarchy, when you load the new css it will overwrite what you had before. also you'd need handlers to load all offsite css and js turning all src and href into full urls before you render.... nightmare
[04:20:57] <wfq> Xtrivity, have you tried to include in your html a file called my_preload_images.js where a java object is created so that myImages.image1 = "http:// ...."
[04:21:07] <Xtrivity> Solet any idea in regards to my question? How I could preload an background image as it's pretty apparent how to
[04:21:09] <wfq> the browser will load those images and will be preloaded
[04:21:27] <Xtrivity> wfq - that's not useful as I need it to be a background image. not a static img src
[04:21:46] <wfq> Solet, so you mean that a div won't do but an iframe yes?
[04:21:49] <wfq> or nonoe of them?
[04:22:01] <Solet> xtrivity: load all the backgrounds into hidden divs
[04:22:16] <Solet> then when your page "makes" the ocntent that'll use that background its there for you
[04:22:46] <Solet> i assume its for something like a form that appears when somethings clicked?
[04:22:55] <Xtrivity> Solet - I only have one image but it's pretty heavy. I'm using an ajax loader image by default but to throw a huge image on top I want to do based on load. It's a bit of a hack to do it that way.
[04:23:28] <Xtrivity> wfq iframe's can be placed inside of divs just fine. Simply make sure to z-index the div to avoid major issues.
[04:24:06] <Solet> Xtrivity: i'm not following
[04:27:20] <wfq> this should do:  $('<div><iframe src="http://www.google.com/" width="300" height="300" /></div>').dialog({ modal: true, width: 300, height: 300});
[04:27:39] <wfq> I can't get it working
[04:27:52] <Xtrivity> lol
[04:29:06] <Xtrivity> wfq that syntax is super incorrect. i suggest you read the jquery api documents.
[04:29:15] <Xtrivity> *jquery documents.
[04:30:54] <wfq> fuck sake
[04:32:02] <seutje> Xtrivity: how is that syntax incorrect?
[04:32:07] <xec_> Xtrivity: what does "super incorrect" mean? what, specifically, is wrong
[04:32:16] <seutje> nothing afaict
[04:33:13] <Xtrivity> the selector for what I beleive he's trying to do is incorrect. He's trying to get the iframe to show up in the div. Writing it would use of .html();
[04:33:35] <xec_> Xtrivity: there's nothing wrong with passing a html string to $()
[04:34:29] <Xtrivity> If he has a div <div id="test"> he's going to have to do $('#test').html("<iframe blah blah"); essentially would he not?
[04:34:34] <xec_> Xtrivity: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery2
[04:34:57] <Kambfhase> wenn man keine Ahnung hat, ...
[04:35:07] <seutje> he might need to inject it into the dom first, but the syntax is correct
[04:35:16] <xec_> Xtrivity: if he does not have a div with id "test", he might want to create one ;)
[04:35:16] <Xtrivity> hah - learn something new everyday. Didn't think jquery had that option.
[04:35:41] <Xtrivity> I assumed you had to create one by selecting an initial div or such.
[04:35:43] <seutje> wfq: odd, seems to work for me
[04:36:06] <Xtrivity> my appologies. I had no idea.
[04:36:10] <seutje> wfq: don't mind the lack of CSS: http://jsfiddle.net/uHMxr/
[04:36:51] <wfq> seutje, xec_. Thanks. I will check what is going on then but I am glad that I know it works
[04:36:53] <wfq> thanks a lot
[04:37:02] <ak> hi
[04:37:03] <Xtrivity> seutje: any idea how to preload a background image.
[04:37:13] <Xtrivity> wfq - sorry bout my useful information.
[04:37:18] <Xtrivity> *useless
[04:37:31] <wfq> Xtrivity, no worries mate :)
[04:37:40] <Solet> anyone know how to get all elements with class "someclass" to be both draggable and resizable?
[04:37:58] <Solet> note that these elements dont exist at time of load, they're added later
[04:38:29] <ak> is it possible to have a selector like this somehow: $("div.control-group.valid:contains(span.indicator:empty)")   ?
[04:40:07] <ak> or to select some div, that contains some span with no text content? :)
[04:40:50] <Xtrivity> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/uHMxr/ sets as an actual image. But i need it to be a background image - any idea how you'd go about that?
[04:42:28] <seutje> Xtrivity: did u copy/paste the wrong link?
[04:44:21] <seutje> Xtrivity: like this: http://jsfiddle.net/NNMd9/1/ ?
[04:45:42] <seutje> actually, this is prolly better: http://jsfiddle.net/NNMd9/2/
[04:46:13] <seutje> more better: http://jsfiddle.net/NNMd9/3/
[04:47:04] <Solet> seutje: do you know how ot make elements created have draggable(with handle) and resizable?
[04:47:18] <Solet> i can get them all to drag, but only most recently created resizes
[04:48:02] <seutje> Solet: using jQuery UI resizable?
[04:48:16] <Solet> yes
[04:48:26] <Solet> at the bottom of my function that makes the element i put: $(".window").draggable({ handle: ".title", containment: "#desktop" }).resizable({ handles: "se" });
[04:48:55] <Xtrivity> seutje: why do you <img/> as the element if you're not using it essentially in the html at all?
[04:49:07] <seutje> Xtrivity: to trigger the load
[04:49:27] <seutje> it's off-DOM, less performance impact that way
[04:49:58] <Xtrivity> alright. If i wanted to add a "spinner" and than have that effect fade in - is that a possiblity with a background image?
[04:50:51] <Solet> yes
[04:51:02] <Xtrivity> you can fade in a background image?
[04:51:19] <Xtrivity> guess i'd be fading in the div.
[04:51:19] <Solet> well sorta
[04:51:26] <Solet> you have 2 container divs
[04:51:43] <Solet> the start with the spinner then the one with the bg
[04:51:52] <Solet> then you play with transparency and fade them
[04:52:50] <Xtrivity> makes sense
[04:53:41] <Xtrivity> Solet -- div's would have to be floated and indexed then eh?
[04:53:50] <Xtrivity> *z-indexed
[04:53:53] <Solet> not floated
[04:54:00] <Solet> nor zindexed really
[04:54:14] <Xtrivity> ... what would you do?
[04:54:15] <Solet> is this the pages entire background we're talking about?
[04:54:19] <Xtrivity> yes indeed.
[04:54:44] <Solet> ok outside of your main wrapper put <div id="bg1"><div id="bg2">
[04:54:47] <Solet> close them off at the end
[04:54:52] <Solet> bg2 has your spinner
[04:55:18] <Solet> wait... hang on a sec
[04:55:31] <Solet> setting transparent there will propigate down i think
[04:56:40] <Solet> gimme a secf
[04:56:45] <Xtrivity> no worries.
[04:57:01] <Solet> i'm no closer to solving my problem so maybe dicking around with yours will help make something spring to mind on mine
[04:57:11] <seutje> Solet: works fine for me http://jsfiddle.net/uHMxr/1/
[04:58:07] <Solet> seutje: those dont move with a handle
[04:58:33] <jaffipaffi> Hey guys.. Do you know of a plugin/script that can convert an <ul> menu to <select>? For use in responsive designs?
[04:58:49] <jaffipaffi> It should be able to run recursively to get submenu-links too
[04:58:51] <seutje> Solet: oh right, forgot draggable
[04:59:30] <Xtrivity> seutje: Solet is trying to help but maybe you can throw your input in as well. How would you suggest doing a pre-loader spinner in the situation to fade in the div and such.
[04:59:54] <seutje> Solet: they collapse as soon as you resize them though: http://jsfiddle.net/uHMxr/2/
[05:00:09] <seutje> Xtrivity: use a pseudo-element?
[05:00:26] <seutje> or do u have to support IE<8
[05:00:29] <seutje> ?
[05:01:26] <Xtrivity> I would like to cator to every browser up to IE6
[05:01:29] <Xtrivity> *cater
[05:01:35] <xec_> up to? :)
[05:01:42] <seutje> oh wait, can't fade pseudo elements anyway
[05:01:43] <Xtrivity> * hehe downto.
[05:01:59] <Solet> xtrivity, yes z-index <div id="bg" style="z-index:0"><div id="tempbg" style="z-index:0;"></div><main stuffs here></div>
[05:02:01] <seutje> then u'll have to create a child element, I'm affraid
[05:02:06] <Solet> what you gotta do is -- oops
[05:02:21] <Solet> main container has zindex 2, and you set everything with position to be right on top of each other
[05:02:29] <Solet> then simply fade tempbg out
[05:03:15] <Xtrivity> Solet but that that element still exists and if id="bg" ends up being the container than that's a problem.
[05:04:08] <Solet> bg is your huge bg image background
[05:04:48] <Solet> you set it to be the whole size of window (or whatever you want), you tell temp to be the same, and same with wrapper
[05:05:04] <Solet> temp and wrapper sit next to each other, not in each other in the code, so fading out temp isnt an issue
[05:05:39] <Solet> if you wanna short cut it a little, use body for bg then just have 2 divs in body, one tempbg one wrapper
[05:08:04] <Solet> seutje: that has it working for multiple elements but they were made at the same time... mine arent made at the same time, they could be made seconds or hours apart
[05:10:28] <seutje> Xtrivity: http://jsfiddle.net/ZXGvC/1/
[05:11:14] <seutje> Xtrivity: better: http://jsfiddle.net/ZXGvC/2/
[05:12:49] <seutje> Xtrivity: forgot the fade :D http://jsfiddle.net/ZXGvC/5/
[05:13:09] <seutje> Solet: how bout you make me a fiddle so I can see what the actual problem is?
[05:13:38] <Xtrivity> seutje: i haven't looked at your fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/NNMd9/8/ here's whwat i did. is that super incorrect/
[05:15:39] <Solet> seutje: kinda impractical =/ its a crapload of code
[05:16:43] <Solet> also >.> i just fixed it
[05:16:45] <keirlav87> i'm using $.tmpl, but i'd like to keep my code more organised than having the templates on the same page, what would be the best option for loading the template?
[05:17:32] <crazydiamond> Hi. I need to write $('img[src='+src+']') selector. How do I properly escape src var before passing it there?
[05:17:40] <seutje> Solet: http://jsfiddle.net/uHMxr/3/ like that then?
[05:17:45] <Solet> instead of sticking the new element in with js then adding stuffs to it with jq i did this in the make new function (more or less) http://jsfiddle.net/C8YSU/6/
[05:17:48] <seutje> just rerun it, excluding the ones u already got
[05:18:39] <Solet> *nod* i think it was js and jq fighting with each other for some reason
[05:18:51] <seutje> Solet: if you would have told me these were created as the result of an event, I would just have said "use the callback"
[05:18:55] <Kambfhase> crazydiamond: why so difficult?
[05:19:06] <seutje> Solet: jq *IS* js -_-
[05:19:18] <seutje> ?jsisjs
[05:19:19] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[05:19:26] <Kambfhase> crazydiamond: $('img').filter(function(){ return this.src == src; })
[05:19:47] <crazydiamond> Kabfhase: I want to write script, that dynamically add images to be preloaded. Cool, thanks!
[05:19:52] <Solet> seutje: i realize that. but... idk when i stopped writing to innerHTML and used appendTo it suddenly worked
[05:19:54] <Kambfhase> :)
[05:20:28] <seutje> Solet: that's coz innerHTML doesn't return a reference to the element you injected, as you're not using proper DOM API methods to add them
[05:21:07] <Solet> i know. i was getting the element with jq later doing $(".theclass").blah
[05:21:13] <keirlav87> anyone use $.tmpl that can advise on a good way to load the template from elsewhere in teh project so my code can be abit more organised?
[05:21:40] <Solet> i've learned my lesson tho :P
[05:22:17] <Solet> $("stuffhere").appendTo("new parent) == good, innerHTML==evil
[05:22:45] <Solet> >.> obviously only good when i remember to close quotes
[05:23:14] <keirlav87> is there a way to get the numerical index of a key:value pair within an object?
[05:23:37] <Kambfhase> numerical index? an object is not sorted.
[05:25:34] <keirlav87> so theres no inherent way to get the numerical index of an properties position within an object?
[05:25:43] <xec_> it doesnt have one
[05:26:45] <keirlav87> well, it does in a sense because if you have an object { "one" : "one", "two" : "two" etcetc } up to 10 and iterate through and append to the dom, you will get 1 to 10 in order
[05:27:02] <blackspotwiggins> keirlav87, ordering is random
[05:27:26] <Kambfhase> yeah, that is pure luck.
[05:29:13] <keirlav87> maybe its php and the way the json_encode function works that is giving me my ordering then, because i'm predictably using .each on json returned from the server to create dom elements
[05:29:32] <ddssc> got a json like this "{"columns":["alert_id","machine_id","type","description","tags","timestamp"]}" . how do I iterate over it?
[05:30:06] <keirlav87> ddssc: $.each(data.columns,function(i,v){ })?
[05:30:24] <blackspotwiggins> keirlav87, is you need ordering, use arrays
[05:31:20] <ddssc> keirlav87, doesn't work. TypeError: a is undefined. think it's literlly trying to read it as a string...
[05:31:52] <phil-adept> Hi all. Does anyone have any experience using jQuery Masonry?
[05:31:55] <keirlav87> have you set the content type in your ajax call?
[05:32:16] <jaffipaffi> Hey guys.. I have an UL menu with multiple levels. When I click an <li>, I want to count how many <ul>'s down it is. See this example: http://jsfiddle.net/ZR74T/1/ . How can I do this?
[05:32:30] <jaffipaffi> I want to see how many <ul>'s there is between the clicked li and $('.menu')
[05:32:46] <Sandra> Any js/jQuery guru awake? That know about IE8? :P
[05:32:52] <ddssc> keirlav87, content type?
[05:33:09] <dns-away> * #jquery :http://jquery.com/
[05:33:52] <Kambfhase> ?ask @ Sandra
[05:33:53] <bot-t> Sandra, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:36:21] <Sandra> Kambfhase: Sorry, http://jsfiddle.net/CEAU4/34/ .. this code works fine for me in Chroem/IE/FF etc .. But for some reason it doesnt work for a person using IE8 .. it goes with the else.. and thinks the image is less then 1px .. And I cant for the love of god recreate the issue :(
[05:36:31] <jaffipaffi> Got it.. Could just use parentsUntil :)
[05:36:31] <Kambfhase> jaffipaffi: http://jsfiddle.net/ZR74T/2/
[05:36:50] <jaffipaffi> Or I couldn't do that
[05:37:03] <jaffipaffi> Thanks Kambfhase . That works flawlessly!
[05:37:19] <Kambfhase> :)
[05:37:27] <nFFF> or http://jsfiddle.net/ZR74T/3/
[05:38:03] <Kambfhase> haha, thats nasty
[05:38:40] <nFFF> lol why?
[05:39:03] <jaffipaffi> nFFF: Wouldn't work if there's multiple <ul>'s on page: http://jsfiddle.net/ZR74T/4/
[05:39:41] <nFFF> jaffipaffi, just use better selectors :>
[05:39:59] <jaffipaffi> nFFF: I just figured that out...
[05:40:00] <jaffipaffi> :P
[05:40:35] <Kambfhase> Sandra: img.width is a number, not a string
[05:40:53] <Sandra> Kambfhase: doesnt matter, it makes no difference.. i just tried it :P
[05:40:59] <Sandra> Kambfhase: gives the same result
[05:41:24] <Kambfhase> why arent you using jQ for that?
[05:41:29] <seutje> Sandra: Y U USE ONLOAD?!
[05:41:36] <Sandra> it is onload :D
[05:41:38] <seutje> Y U NO BIND EVENTS PROPERLY?
[05:41:49] <Kambfhase> Y U NO JQUERY?
[05:41:52] <Sandra> :(
[05:41:54] <Sandra> meanies!
[05:42:08] <seutje> I'm just wondering if there's a reason, rly
[05:42:25] <Sandra> seutje: Naa, im just enw to javascript.. blame it on that :)
[05:42:27] <Kambfhase> maybe she like the pain
[05:42:38] <Sandra> Pft
[05:42:54] <Sandra> How would you record that .onload with jquery instead? :o
[05:42:58] <seutje> Sandra: there can only be 1 onload
[05:43:05] <seutje> ?on @ Sandra
[05:43:06] <bot-t> Sandra, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[05:43:16] <Sandra> <3
[05:43:27] <dns-away> ?bot @ ZZ
[05:43:27] <bot-t> ZZ, ?bot-t
[05:43:58] <seutje> Sandra: or if you don't like jQuery and enjoy fucking around with attachEvent/addEventListener, you can do it manually
[05:43:59] <Sandra> dns-away: Telling a bot what to do, makes you feel more dominant, doesnt it? :)
[05:44:01] <ddssc> jQuery.each( obj, function( key, value ) {
[05:44:01] <ddssc>   console.log( "key", key, "value", value );
[05:44:01] <ddssc> });
[05:44:07] <ddssc> ....
[05:44:27] <seutje> moar dots
[05:44:29] <seutje> MOAR!!
[05:44:33] <ddssc> how do I iterate over this? "{"columns":{"0":"alert_id","1":"machine_id","2":"type","3":"description","4":"tags","5":"timestamp"}}
[05:44:42] <ddssc> stupid c+p
[05:44:45] <seutje> ddssc: you parse it forst?
[05:44:46] <seutje> first?
[05:45:01] <seutje> one does not simply iterate over a string
[05:45:19] <Kambfhase> bot-t, see bot-t
[05:45:20] <bot-t> Kambfhase, JQuery bot commands - jQuery Wiki - The bot in the #jquery channel on Freenode has a few commands that should help in collaborative debugging or explanations. http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_bot_commands
[05:45:22] <Sandra> seutje: I was just happy i got it working for some reason.. and still when i alert it it says "360" (the width).. and if (bleh = 360) { mupp } else {mupp2 } .. and it goes with the else :(
[05:45:23] <ddssc> huh, isn't that json object?
[05:45:30] <dns-away> ?Great bpot :-)
[05:45:31] <bot-t> dns-away, Couldn't find "Great bpot :-)" in jQuery Docs.
[05:45:49] <seutje> Sandra: did you parseInt?
[05:46:21] <seutje> ddssc: it looks like a JSON string, yea, but it needs to be parsed to an object first
[05:46:23] <ddssc> seutje, i guess js is treating as a string.... how do I set proper type (json or js array) in $.ajax ?
[05:46:43] <nFFF> ?parsejson
[05:46:44] <bot-t> jQuery.parseJSON(json): Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[05:46:51] <seutje> application/json, isn't it?
[05:47:04] <seutje> wait this is in an ajax callback?
[05:47:13] <seutje> aren't they suppose to be parsed automagically
[05:47:25] <ddssc> this is what my php returns in response to ajax get..
[05:47:49] <ddssc> I can do whwatever I want with it in php
[05:48:21] <Kambfhase> ?bot @ bot-t
[05:48:22] <bot-t> bot-t, ?bot-t
[05:48:48] <seutje> ddssc: yeah, I think ajax callbacls automagically parse it when the datatype is set properly
[05:48:59] <seutje> callbacks*
[05:49:27] <ddssc> seutje, if php returns this "columns":["a","b","c"] and I assign it to an array in callback.. will it be an actual array? coz that's what I ultimately need, a goddam array
[05:49:32] <nFFF> ddssc why not return an obejct that contains an array
[05:49:45] <nFFF> rather then an obejct that contains mini objects with numeric keys?
[05:49:48] <seutje> ddssc: if your mimetype is set properly and the ajax request datatype is set, sure
[05:49:50] <nFFF> better to jsut use an array
[05:50:20] <seutje> ddssc: wait a second, are you manually building this string, or having php do a json_encode on an array?
[05:50:58] <ddssc> seutje, I did it with json encode but I'll build it manually now, since this doesnt work.
[05:51:10] <seutje> oh god
[05:51:13] <ddssc> it's not difficult to do
[05:51:20] <seutje> don't ever manually build JSON
[05:51:23] <ddssc> and this crap is making me mad.
[05:51:48] <seutje> when all else fails, just manually parse it
[05:51:57] <nFFF> ddssc, it's not hard, i've told you what to do, first, return an object that cotnains an array
[05:52:07] <nFFF> and fi you ahve issues use parseJSON
[05:52:31] <seutje> looks like it is an object containing an object
[05:52:40] <seutje> that just happens to have numeric keys
[05:52:40] <ddssc> nFFF; ok so something like this? {"object":["a","b","c"]} ?
[05:52:41] <nFFF> use getJSON to actually retrieve it, and it should be parsed for you in the callback
[05:52:49] <nFFF> ddssc thats what i would do
[05:53:09] <ddssc> nFFF, cant use getJSON since I'm calling it synchronously
[05:53:24] <nFFF> What do you mean?
[05:53:34] <nFFF> getJSON is jsut a wrapper around $.ajax
[05:53:36] <seutje> oh boy, synchronous ajax? I understand why ur mad
[05:53:37] <ddssc> nFFF, $.ajax sync:false
[05:53:47] <seutje> asynx: false*
[05:53:49] <nFFF> why are you using sync false?
[05:53:52] <seutje> async: false*
[05:53:52] <ddssc> aye
[05:54:05] <ddssc> what he wrote
[05:54:18] <nFFF> ddssc, how come you need syncronous requests?
[05:54:26] <ddssc> yes, Im using a synchronouse asynchronouse javascript :)
[05:54:33] <seutje> but why?
[05:54:36] <ddssc> COZ I CAN
[05:54:42] <seutje> OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T
[05:54:45] <ddssc> :D
[05:54:58] <seutje> screw this, db import is done, back to project work
[05:55:07] <ddssc> im shit at js. how would I call the php script and wiat for it's response otherwise?
[05:55:22] <seutje> ddssc: that's what callbacks are for!
[05:55:36] <ddssc> seuje, moar code?
[05:55:59] <dns-away> ?ajax @ ddssc
[05:56:00] <bot-t> ddssc, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[05:56:16] <dns-away> yah :)
[05:56:56] <ddssc> meh, cba stuffing all my code in a callback. especially since I got event binds and whatnot in it. nah, I just need a stupid php script to return simple json, and I can get on with my life
[05:57:03] <seutje> ddssc: $.ajax('foo.php', { success: function() { /* I won't be called till the result returns! */ } })
[05:57:11] <ddssc> yea, no
[05:57:13] <ddssc> :F
[05:58:31] <seutje> so ur doing a synchronous request because you're too lazy(?) to abstract the stuff that depends on the result?
[05:59:35] <seutje> lord have mercy on the users facing those pages and the developers that'll have to maintain it after you
[05:59:59] <blackspotwiggins> amen
[06:00:00] <blackspotwiggins> :D
[06:00:10] <ddssc> seutje, whats the difference between waiting for result of this and stuffing it in a callback?
[06:00:19] <blackspotwiggins> sync blocks UI
[06:00:24] <seutje> halting execution?
[06:00:26] <DraeliYvesAstier> hi
[06:00:36] <blackspotwiggins> and if you cant handle ajax, stay the hell away from programming IMO
[06:00:48] <seutje> or at least from the intertubes
[06:00:56] <ddssc> blackspotwiggins, oooh helpfuk
[06:00:58] <blackspotwiggins> yes, please build deathlasers :)
[06:01:01] <ddssc> heh helpfuk
[06:01:10] <seutje> you can make iOS apps if u want, I never have to deal with those anyway
[06:01:20] <blackspotwiggins> i want this laser to fire with 400 million watts, whats the problem
[06:01:22] <xec_> blackspotwiggins: lol. let the problem solve itself :)
[06:01:43] <ddssc> btw, this is called BEFORE showing any UI so your point is invalid.
[06:01:58] <ddssc> this is needed for shwing ui, in my case datatables
[06:02:38] <ddssc> for initializing even, so callback or async makes no difference whatsoever
[06:03:15] <jaffipaffi> How can I search in <option> where value = 'query' in a selector?
[06:03:39] <seutje> $('option[value=query]') but these can be rather heavy on shitty browsers
[06:03:48] <Wolf_22> I have a directory which stores images I use for a jQuery slideshow. In the jQuery itself, these images are hard-coded into an array and what I would instead like to do is traverse the directory and loop through each image to programmatically store each image's URL into the array. Can something like this be done through a type of URL query string routine?
[06:03:59] <dns-away> jaffipaffi: / http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox /
[06:05:14] <nFFF> Wolf_22, just iterate over the directory and store $(this).prop('src') into an array
[06:05:58] <Wolf_22> nFFF: I'll do that. Thanks for the clarity! :)
[06:07:40] <bobsapp> I have this issue on my websie where the jQuery objects loads but does not load the $ object.  Does anyone have any good links / tips on how to debug or resolve this?
[06:07:46] <bobsapp> in kinda new to jquery
[06:09:53] <Wolf_22> nFFF: Do you know of any jQuery API routines or functions that traverse a directory?
[06:10:14] <nFFF> what type fo directory?
[06:10:20] <seutje> jQuery don't do I/O
[06:10:25] <blackspotwiggins> Wolf_22, you might want to do that on the server
[06:10:50] <jaffipaffi> seutje: I've tried var activeLink = $nav.find('.active').last().children('a').attr('href'); $('option[value="'+activeLink+'"]').attr('selected',true);, but that didn't work
[06:11:07] <jaffipaffi> activeLink is set correctly, so it's something in the option selector
[06:11:20] <seutje> jaffipaffi: set val() on the <select>
[06:11:25] <Wolf_22> nFFF: Just a general directory on a server (it's a Linux machine).
[06:11:33] <seutje> don't set selected on the option
[06:11:48] <elek> bobsapp: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[06:12:02] <bobsapp> elek: ive been using that around most of my code.
[06:12:09] <nFFF> Wolf_22, so you build the array on the server and pass it to the client
[06:12:21] <bobsapp> but i would still like to investigate why jquery isnt being initialised properly
[06:12:31] <seutje> Wolf_22: for obvious security reasons, browser JS has no access to the server's file system directory listings
[06:12:35] <bobsapp> i guess i might be going too deep into this problem
[06:12:50] <elek> are you using $.noConflict()?
[06:12:56] <Wolf_22> nFFF: Sounds like you're implying that I'm using a backend tech with this... I'm trying to achieve all this with jQuery alone, which is why I thought a traversal of a URL pattern could work.
[06:13:00] <bobsapp> elek: yep
[06:13:25] <elek> that's you're issue, it releases the $ alias from the jQuery object
[06:13:27] <nFFF> Wolf_22, then the direcroy is jsut a html page with a list of omages/urls ?
[06:13:28] <elek> your*
[06:13:41] <bobsapp> let me post some code
[06:14:38] <jaffipaffi> seutje: My fault.. Was trying to make it active before it was injected to dom lol
[06:14:46] <Wolf_22> nFFF: What I'm thinking is this: if there's a single directory with images, I could use a function that takes in a single URL location and traverses that for image files if each image name has a consistent file name (i.e. - "file1", "file2", etc.)
[06:15:31] <nFFF> Wolf_22, you want jquery to act as some sort of web socket? open urls and filter the content?
[06:15:41] <seutje> that's not rly traversing a folder, that's guessing urls till it fails
[06:16:03] <bobsapp> my noconflict code is at http://jsfiddle.net/kYtgf
[06:16:13] <Wolf_22> seutje: It's traversing a directory as far as jQuery is concerned...
[06:16:24] <bobsapp> so would that release the $ alias outside of that closure?
[06:16:43] <danheberden> that first line is messed up bobsapp
[06:16:48] <seutje> Wolf_22: as far as jQuery is concerned, traversing a directory is not supported
[06:16:54] <Wolf_22> nFFF: I just want to fill an array with URL locations of images it happens to find in a given location really.
[06:17:06] <danheberden> http://jsfiddle.net/kYtgf/1/
[06:17:09] <danheberden> bobsapp: ^
[06:17:14] <hirsty> hey all still unable to load my datepicker after an ajax call :(
[06:17:23] <seutje> Wolf_22: so just for loop, create images and stop once they fail to load
[06:17:25] <nFFF> if you know the aming convention fo the images, I guess it's possible
[06:17:37] <Wolf_22> seutje: That's what I'm beginning to realize, but if I can assume a given naming pattern with the images, it could be "synthesized" at least.
[06:17:56] <bobsapp> oh god
[06:18:03] <bobsapp> im so stupid thanks gus
[06:18:06] <bobsapp> *guys
[06:18:06] <elek> yeah, danheberden's example is spot on.
[06:18:13] <seutje> Wolf_22: but why wouldn't u want to do this on the backend and cache it?
[06:18:14] <dns-away> xD *
[06:18:31] <hirsty> why im working is it is im using my ajax to get an xmlhttprequest to fill an iframe, within those contents is a datepicker and need it for the person to select a date
[06:18:47] <Wolf_22> seutje: I don't want to hassle with the PL/SQL that's involved in that approach.
[06:19:50] <ddssc> Wolf_22: .find(img'[
[06:19:51] <blackspotwiggins> you use pl/sql to do 'ls' ?
[06:20:02] <seutje> I should use that line on projects once in a while
[06:20:03] <hirsty> its like the datepicker isnt even loading - the set buttons arent even showing
[06:20:34] <Wolf_22> ddssc: Thanks, I'll look into this.
[06:20:38] <ddssc> wolf22; find(img[name*=custom]).each( put into an array) . think that's what you need to do
[06:20:58] <seutje> wait, these are already in the page? o.O
[06:21:15] <Wolf_22> ddssc: You rock. I'll start toying with this then because I think you're right: I think that's what I'm looking for.
[06:21:21] <blackspotwiggins> as if you dont already have an array if you use $("img")
[06:21:26] <seutje> lol?
[06:21:35] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, sssh
[06:21:38] <blackspotwiggins> needs moar pl/sql
[06:21:41] <seutje> so u wanna traverse a directory to grab images that... are already in the page?
[06:21:50] * seutje 's head just asploded
[06:21:55] <ddssc> Wolf_22, np
[06:22:10] <hirsty> anyone? :D
[06:22:59] <seutje> reminds me of a project at my first job, it had to be in Flash cause ppl needed to be able to run it standalone, and it needed to be able to run standalone cause not everybody has the rights to install flash
[06:23:11] <blackspotwiggins> lols
[06:23:12] <bembelimen> hirsty i think you have to add all events to your loaded content manually (or use any refresh stuff)
[06:23:32] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, how did that turn out?
[06:23:39] <seutje> I resigned
[06:23:59] <blackspotwiggins> probably a good call
[06:24:01] <hirsty> so in my ajax response ive currently got my content loading into my iframe, should i set it to then refresh it?
[06:24:01] <seutje> true story, btw
[06:24:56] <code_ph0y> hey guys how do you destroy an element?
[06:24:56] <hirsty> bembelimen
[06:25:11] <Kambfhase> KILL IT WITH FIRE
[06:26:03] <bembelimen> hirsty when you "call" your datepicker code and after make a ajay request, you have to call the datepicker code again
[06:26:10] <barraponto> $(element).kill(9)
[06:26:11] <code_ph0y> whats the code for that then ..... $('#element').killItWithFire();
[06:26:12] <code_ph0y> ?
[06:26:14] <bembelimen> *ajay = ajax
[06:26:15] <code_ph0y> :P
[06:26:19] <code_ph0y> remove got it :D
[06:27:08] <blackspotwiggins> code_ph0y, it can be that as well.. $.fn.killItWithFire =  $.fn.remove
[06:27:24] <bembelimen> i have a "strange" problem...i'm not really sure, if I have a problem at all
[06:27:24] <code_ph0y> lmao!
[06:27:28] <code_ph0y> loving it
[06:27:32] <bembelimen> i'm playing with jquery 1.8
[06:27:34] <bembelimen> http://pastebin.com/pri9YjCC
[06:27:49] <bembelimen> this is the scripts.js: http://jsfiddle.net/bembelimen/2k8AE/1/
[06:27:57] <code_ph0y> hirsty: how i do it is have a function what gets called every time you fire your ajax event
[06:28:21] <bembelimen> in my script i always get an alert box with the content 0
[06:28:27] <Kambfhase> bembelimen: wait for document.ready!
[06:28:31] <bembelimen> if i call the script in firebug it works fine
[06:28:34] <blackspotwiggins> bembelimen, alerts 6 for me
[06:28:38] <bembelimen> yep
[06:28:42] <bembelimen> thats the strange thing
[06:28:59] <bembelimen> everywhere in all pastes or if i use another environment i get 6
[06:29:07] <Kambfhase> bembelimen: your code gets executed, before the imgs are in the dom. wait for document.ready
[06:29:24] <bembelimen> i thought (function($) is domready?
[06:29:35] <hirsty> lemme get my current ajax :)
[06:29:54] <Kambfhase> bembelimen: http://jsfiddle.net/CEAU4/34/ << way to go
[06:30:21] <bembelimen> ok, thank you
[06:31:03] <code_ph0y> blackspotwiggins: i kinda wanna do that now! :P
[06:31:10] <seutje> blackspotwiggins: damn, beat me to the killItWithFire alias :P
[06:33:03] <blackspotwiggins> feel free to add more extras
[06:33:11] <blackspotwiggins> console.log("ZOMG FIRE")
[06:33:54] <hirsty> heres my ajax that gets the content - the datepicker is in addholiday.php - http://pastebin.com/6JS7AM0B
[06:36:20] <seutje> hirsty: whoa, manual ajax, that's pretty balsy :P
[06:36:37] <hirsty> >.>
[06:36:59] * seutje lifts his hat
[06:37:18] <DEac-_> servus
[06:37:18] <hirsty> it works as is except my bloody datepicker -_-
[06:37:48] <hirsty> and im not going thru around 5k lines of code to change it around again :D
[06:38:43] <DEac-_> i've an div and i want to scroll to it. it's in an own area. $(area).scrollTop(mydiv) does not work. how i can i do it?
[06:39:05] <hirsty> DEac u can do it thru CSS
[06:39:34] <DEac-_> hirsty: really? which attribute?
[06:39:38] <seutje> DEac-_: scrolltop expects a number, doesn't it?
[06:39:43] <hirsty> height: (certain height)px; overflow:scroll
[06:40:04] <DEac-_> seutje: of course. but i thought 'try it'
[06:40:18] <seutje> you'll prolly have to do some math with the offset
[06:40:37] <DEac-_> hirsty: i don't understand. my area has this behaviour.
[06:40:45] <seutje> like $area.scrollTop($mydiv.offset().top - $area.offset.top); or something?
[06:40:55] <seutje> might wanna parseInt though
[06:40:57] <DEac-_> ah
[06:41:04] <hirsty> with setting height ur forcing content outside of the div, which is hidden and with overflow:scroll your allowing the content to be scrollable
[06:41:08] <DEac-_> the offset
[06:41:10] <seutje> assuming $area and $mydiv are jquery collections already
[06:41:23] <DEac-_> seutje: yes, of course
[06:42:01] <hirsty> give me a min and i will create a fiddle for you
[06:43:24] <DEac-_> seutje: but $area has an offset of 29px (position: fixed) and now i call it, it toggles from above to middle. i will try to reproduce it in jsfiddle...
[06:45:10] <hirsty> here you go http://jsfiddle.net/7su4F/
[06:45:25] <hirsty> @DEac-_
[06:45:25] <nFFF> Guys any idea why: console.log(scrollc.offset()); var offsetT = scrollc.offset().top; // where scrollc.offset() returns a valdi obejct with key .top ?
[06:45:43] <DEac-_> hirsty: and where's the function, which scrolles?
[06:45:43] <nFFF> its throwing error Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined
[06:45:57] <hirsty> dont need it its all CSS :)
[06:46:12] <superjacaman> someone uses jCaret plugin ?
[06:46:13] <DEac-_> hirsty: and how i define it in css to scroll?
[06:46:23] <hirsty> look at the fiddle
[06:46:50] <DEac-_> hirsty: which stands for: scrollTo: objectX?
[06:47:06] <hirsty> ......
[06:47:33] <hirsty> its just using the overflow css attribute no javascript/jquery rwequired
[06:47:34] <TheBrayn> what's the difference between $('foo > bar') and $('foo').find('bar')?
[06:48:04] <seutje> hirsty: he wants the shit to actually scroll, automagically
[06:48:05] <DEac-_> hirsty: no, it's impossible in css
[06:48:17] <hirsty> it does scroll
[06:48:28] <DEac-_> hirsty: but no to #obj
[06:48:38] <seutje> DEac-_: http://jsfiddle.net/JYXv8/1/
[06:48:43] <DEac-_> i can scroll, but not, press on a button and it scrolls to #obj
[06:48:46] <seutje> also, might be interesting:
[06:48:51] <seutje> ?scrollto
[06:48:53] <bot-t> seutje, ScrollTo - jQuery Plugins - With this plugin, you will easily scroll overflowed elements, and the screen itself. It gives you access to many different options to customize and various ways to specify where to scroll. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[06:49:04] <nFFF> TheBrayn first is bar is child of foo, second is bar is descandent of foo
[06:49:25] <hirsty> mustv misunderstood apologies
[06:49:26] <seutje> DEac-_: http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/
[06:49:35] <sendoushi> hey guys. anyone uses jScrollPane? having a problem with a margin on the arrows
[06:49:49] <barraponto> TheBrayn: foo > bar is equal to  $('foo').children('bar')
[06:50:10] <DEac-_> seutje: you are faster than i *g* but your code has the same behaviour like mine. if you press on 'click me' a twice, it scrolls up
[06:50:59] <hirsty> bembelimen: where should i reinitialize my datepicker in there?
[06:51:44] <seutje> DEac-_: well of course
[06:52:04] <seutje> DEac-_: at that point, the offset top calculation comes up with 0
[06:52:32] <nFFF> console.log(scrollc.offset().top); var offsetT = scrollc.offset().top; //console logs '191', but offsetT returns Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined
[06:52:37] <nFFF> Any ideas?
[06:53:36] <DEac-_> seutje: i think, i need - area.scroll().top
[06:54:27] <seutje> DEac-_: http://jsfiddle.net/JYXv8/2/
[06:54:33] <seutje> just check if it's already there :D
[06:54:51] <code_ph0y> how do you get the last in an array of elements
[06:55:02] <seutje> [-1] ?
[06:55:05] <DEac-_> code_ph0y: [-1]
[06:55:17] <code_ph0y> so if you done something like .... $('.example')
[06:55:26] <seutje> ?eval (['lol', 'poo', 'meh'])[-1]
[06:55:31] <bot-t> seutje: undefined
[06:55:38] <code_ph0y> ohhh
[06:55:41] <code_ph0y> ok? ..
[06:55:43] <DEac-_> seutje: click me -> scroll some lines -> click me -> oops
[06:55:51] <seutje> DEac-_: what oops?
[06:55:58] <code_ph0y> does that mean something like ... $('.example')[-1]; ?
[06:56:13] <DEac-_> seutje: it doesn't scroll to $mydiv
[06:56:33] <seutje> DEac-_: oh yeah, if u scroll past it, it won't be 0, but it'll be -20 or something
[06:56:47] <seutje> DEac-_: maybe you should just use the scrollTo plugin, it already handles all these things
[06:57:01] <seutje> then u can just $area.scrollTo($mydiv)
[06:57:06] <blackspotwiggins> code_ph0y, .last() if you are using jquery objects
[06:57:23] <TheBrayn> http://paste.debian.net/197712/ how should I change this to apply the border to every td in the hovered tr?
[06:57:26] <nFFF> Anyone have any ideas why my shit no be working
[06:57:50] <code_ph0y> ahhh that looks better! ... thanks blackspotwiggins!
[06:57:54] <DEac-_> seutje: i think so
[06:57:57] <seutje> code_ph0y: yeah, can't access last array element with -1 :(
[06:58:38] <seutje> TheBrayn: use a class, stick it on the tr and do the rest in CSS, where it belongs
[06:58:55] <seutje> or just go "fuck IE<8" and use tr:hover td {}
[06:59:27] <seutje> you know you want to :D
[06:59:52] <DEac-_> somebody tried bower? it's usefull?
[07:00:45] <Dron> hello
[07:01:03] <Dron> anyone familiar with socket.io for node.js?
[07:01:14] <Dron> im having some difficulties getting the basic example for it working
[07:01:33] <shesek> Dron, this doesn't have much to do with jQuery
[07:01:52] <shesek> Try ##javascript or #socket.io
[07:02:03] <Dron> sweet, thanks
[07:02:07] <julianalucena> Does .remove() have a synchronous behaviour?
[07:02:10] <shesek> or #node.js
[07:02:25] <shesek> julianalucena, AFAIK, yes
[07:02:28] <julianalucena> I saw this on a very old topic, but the documentations does not point it.
[07:02:34] <shesek> most DOM-related operations are synchronous
[07:03:28] <julianalucena> Hum. Don't you know where can I find this in the docs?
[07:03:52] <shesek> you're looking for that in jQuery's docs? I highly doubt its the right place for that
[07:04:17] <shesek> its up to the browser implementation, and can vary between different browsers and versions
[07:04:42] <shesek> jquery doesn't have any influence over the behavior of the browser
[07:05:04] <julianalucena> Oh, I see.
[07:05:52] <julianalucena> I have to guarantee that a function is called just after the .remove() execution.
[07:05:52] <code_ph0y> hey guys ok so I know you can do something like $('input:checked') but can you do $('.checkboxes:checked') ???
[07:06:20] <scar> code_ph0y: input[type="checkbox"] ?
[07:06:33] <bobsapp> ^
[07:06:42] <shesek> scar, no, :checked filters for checkboxes that are checked
[07:07:03] <code_ph0y> but will that not give me every checkbox on the page :S
[07:07:03] <scar> sorry, input[type="checkbox"]:checked ?
[07:07:27] <code_ph0y> i kinda only want the ones with the class of something
[07:07:40] <code_ph0y> or in this case ... checkboxes
[07:07:45] <scar> input[type="checkbox"].my-class
[07:07:46] <fRAiLtY-> shoky:
[07:08:08] <bobsapp> iirc checkboxes are checked if they have the checked attribute and
[07:08:09] <scar> i mean think about it if input[type="checkbox"] grabs all checkboxes...
[07:08:11] <hirsty> grrr ok this datepicker is annoying me :/
[07:08:11] <bobsapp> thats in the dom
[07:08:32] <code_ph0y> wow! ok i'll check that
[07:08:48] <julianalucena> Thanks, shesek.
[07:09:07] <shesek> julianalucena, you welcome
[07:09:58] <null__> Sorry for the basic question, but what's the jquery equivalent to CSS's :before { content: ""; }?
[07:11:26] <Gx4> hi
[07:11:53] <NodeX> null__ : prepend('Foo');
[07:12:03] <NodeX> or prepend('');
[07:14:43] <Gx4> why can't I do $(".class")[0].removeClass("checked") ? item is a div
[07:16:05] <NodeX> [0] makes it turn to a diff object
[07:16:11] <NodeX> try eq(0) instead
[07:16:29] <code_ph0y> wow! $('input[type="checkbox"]:checked.checkboxes').length this works!
[07:16:31] <code_ph0y> lol
[07:16:34] <danheberden> specifically, [0] accesses the raw dom node at index 0
[07:16:43] <code_ph0y> the power of selectors!
[07:18:28] <seutje> Gx4: use .eq(0) instead
[07:18:31] <seutje> or .first()
[07:18:47] <seutje> not sure which is more performant, should be a marginal difference though
[07:19:17] <Gx4> thanks
[07:25:30] <chowmain> quick question, how do I access an object within an object
[07:25:39] <seutje> object.object
[07:25:56] <chowmain> but I'm not sure what's the name of the object inside it
[07:26:10] <seutje> oh
[07:26:12] <chowmain> I have a screenshot of the console.log(object) here http://photo.weibo.com/2841802583/wbphotos/large/photo_id/3498983810978819?refer=weibofeed
[07:26:29] <seutje> lol says I need to login
[07:26:36] <seutje> at least, I think that's what it's saying
[07:26:45] <chowmain> sorry http://ww4.sinaimg.cn/large/a9627757gw1dxo5ujj0frj.jpg
[07:27:01] <bobsapp> I should really get a weibo account
[07:27:03] <seutje> my hanzi is rusty :P
[07:27:19] <Kambfhase> thats an array!
[07:27:30] <seutje> chowmain: are these jQuery collections?
[07:27:41] <chowmain> really? I tried accessing it using object[0], but get an error
[07:27:51] <chowmain> seutje: these are DOM object i think
[07:27:53] <seutje> cause they're also arrays, and they can be approached as such
[07:27:56] <chowmain> I created them with $()
[07:28:03] <seutje> chowmain: odd, that should work
[07:28:12] <null__> NodeX: thanks mate
[07:28:12] <seutje> and give you the reference to the DOM element
[07:28:28] <chowmain> here is my code, see line 28 http://jsbin.com/ixihej/10/edit
[07:29:08] <ravenzz> does someone know a nice flip clock plugin?
[07:29:22] <chowmain> what's a flip clock?
[07:29:41] <ravenzz> a retro clock
[07:29:59] <chowmain> oh, ic, ravenzz, I know a good countdown plugin using flip clock styling
[07:30:14] <ravenzz> what is its name?
[07:31:33] <Wolf_22> Anyone know what "exec" does in jQuery? From what I have found, it simply executes a RegEx but I can't find an official jQuery API page about it...
[07:32:35] <seutje> ?g mdn exec @ Wolf_22
[07:32:37] <bot-t> Wolf_22, exec | JavaScript | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/exec
[07:32:38] <boulet101010_> maybe because it isn't jquery.
[07:32:42] <seutje> it's not jqueries
[07:33:07] <Wolf_22> Ah, thanks guys.
[07:33:11] <chowmain> ravenzz: actually just found a great one here http://www.radoslavdimov.com/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-digiclock/
[07:34:02] <chowmain> seutje: so did you spot what was the problem?
[07:35:12] <chowmain> the countdown plugin was this one http://code.google.com/p/jquery-countdown/
[07:35:12] <ravenzz> chowmain nice, this one seems alright too http://cnanney.com/journal/demo/apple-counter-revisited/
[07:35:39] <chowmain> there are a bunch of nice ones here http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2012/09/jquery-countdown-scripts.html
[07:36:39] <chowmain> I think the interesting thing about para object is that
[07:36:51] <chowmain> when I first created it, i used the para[i] notation
[07:36:56] <chowmain> which is obviously an array
[07:37:16] <chowmain> however, when testing its length, I had to use object.key(para).length
[07:37:21] <chowmain> otherwise it will report an error
[07:37:36] <chowmain> so I'm not so sure about how to access it
[07:37:58] <seutje> wtf
[07:38:06] <chowmain> ah, sorry
[07:38:10] <chowmain> that wasn't the problem
[07:42:15] <Solet> what kind of resource strain results in having a dozen or so draggable/resizable elements up at once? is it better to only give such things to the "current" element then take them away and give them to the new one when you mousedown on it?
[07:42:43] <code_ph0y> is there a way to get the correct top and left of the element?
[07:43:31] <Solet> this.position();
[07:43:40] <danheberden> code_ph0y: you mean the css attributes or its position?
[07:43:40] <code_ph0y> my offsetTop: 20  i think the e ....................................
[07:43:53] <code_ph0y> nice Solet let me try
[07:44:10] <danheberden> Solet: you mean during a drag?
[07:44:17] <Solet> or ya know whateverelementhere.position();, obvously "this" works as it always has
[07:44:18] <danheberden> it's more about what is dragging
[07:44:40] <Solet> i mean while you're doing nothing at all, and its sitting there listening for a dozen events to fire
[07:44:58] <chowmain> code_ph0y: position() is about relative position to the parent
[07:45:07] <chowmain> if you want absolute position, use offset()
[07:45:11] <code_ph0y> damn!
[07:45:22] <chowmain> which actually means relative position to the document/body
[07:45:23] <code_ph0y> offset() ?
[07:45:34] <Solet> he's right >.>
[07:45:37] <chowmain> var offset = this.offset();
[07:45:39] <code_ph0y> nice amazing guys!
[07:45:43] <chowmain> offset.top
[07:45:47] <chowmain> offset.left
[07:46:09] <Solet> i just... have never had a use to get that didnt think of it
[07:46:50] <Solet> offsetWidth and the like sure, but an offset position? i've never run across needing it :P
[07:48:56] <Solet> how would i look at #thing and tell if .foo is one of its classes?
[07:49:27] <chowmain> how do I access the a element itself when my function look like this     $('a[id^=q]').on('click', function(event) {}
[07:49:58] <duc1199> chowmain: this or second param
[07:50:15] <chowmain> interestingly enough, my first line works, which is this        console.log('a '+this.id+' got clicked');
[07:50:25] <chowmain> but the second time I want to access it, it's not working
[07:50:29] <chowmain> thanks
[07:50:30] <duc1199> also, the event object also has your element
[07:50:39] <chowmain> ah
[07:50:43] <code_ph0y> excellent guys thanks chowmain, Solet!
[07:51:30] <duc1199> its a reference to DOMElement, not jQuery object, which you can get by wrapping $() around said DOMElement
[07:51:35] <Meffen> @chownmain this is nativ html node => $(this) to access jQuery methods
[07:52:00] <Meffen> duc1199 was faster :D
[07:52:48] <Solet> i'm dealing with elements with multiple classes so somevar = el.className isnt really helping >.<
[07:52:49] <duc1199> Meffen: because this: https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=ducati+1199
[07:53:17] <Meffen> :D :D :D
[07:53:29] <Solet> is there an easy way to do if (myelement has .foo) { this contains foo as a class } ??
[07:54:10] <Meffen> if ($('#myelement').hasClass('foo')) { alert('YES'); }
[07:54:29] <Solet> i had no idea hasClass was a thing :P
[07:54:40] <JonahSchulte1> Documentation is your friend ;-)
[07:57:21] <Wolf_22> Using $.ajax, I have figured out how to make a HEAD request for a single .jpg file to determine if it exists or not (script and images have to be on the same server, btw). Now I need to know if many *.jpg files exist in the "url" variable location... (see http://jsfiddle.net/KDK7c/ for code.) How could someone use a RegEx / FOR loop to do this?
[07:58:26] <chowmain> having a little problem with a selector
[07:58:36] <chowmain> the snippet http://jsbin.com/ixihej/11/edit on line 78
[07:58:59] <chowmain> I have a link element and I want to select it's parent ul's siblings
[07:59:20] <chowmain> I did var para = $(this).parent('ul').siblings();
[07:59:27] <chowmain> but get an empty result
[08:00:55] <chowmain> also, can animate be done on multiple elements at the same time?
[08:17:48] <chowmain> anyone?
[08:18:09] <JonahSchulte1> I'm going to go with "yes"
[08:18:25] <chowmain> ;)
[08:18:37] <chowmain> let me repeat my question
[08:18:47] <chowmain> on the snippet http://jsbin.com/ixihej/11/edit on line 78
[08:18:54] <chowmain> I have a link element and I want to select it's parent ul's siblings
[08:19:07] <chowmain> I did var para = $(this).parent('ul').siblings(); but the result is empty
[08:24:15] <quicksilver> chowmain: the links' parents are not <ul>
[08:24:38] <quicksilver> chowmain: perhaps you meant .closest('ul')
[08:27:40] <Guest69518> why did my name change
[08:28:10] <bobsapp> mine too?
[08:28:21] <Kambfhase> .
[08:32:00] <VeryNoob> can someone help me out with the Masonry plug in please? http://pastebin.com/vpuW3ki0
[08:33:23] <code_ph0y> how do you get the innerHTML ?
[08:33:53] <Kambfhase> .html()
[08:34:05] <code_ph0y> basically am trying to do if($('#example').html()=='') {alert('working');}
[08:34:09] <code_ph0y> but its not working
[08:34:38] <Kambfhase> why would you want to do that?
[08:34:40] <code_ph0y> when the element has nothing in the html()
[08:34:58] <Kambfhase> would it be easier to check, if the element has no children?
[08:35:00] <code_ph0y> if there isn't html in the element trigger even
[08:35:00] <code_ph0y> t
[08:35:52] <JonahSchulte1> what about:  if ($('#example').is(':empty')) {
[08:36:09] <code_ph0y> *acts all black and cool* .... show me!
[08:36:10] <JonahSchulte1> it could also be that you have whitespace
[08:36:37] <JonahSchulte1> if($.trim($("#example").text()) == '') {
[08:36:39] <JonahSchulte1> something like that
[08:37:07] <VeryNoob> hey guys, could you help me with this Masonry plug in please?
[08:37:44] <VeryNoob> http://pastebin.com/vpuW3ki0
[08:38:03] <code_ph0y> uuurggghhh!
[08:38:07] <code_ph0y> am a toool!
[08:38:17] <code_ph0y> using the wrong bloody element!
[08:38:24] <code_ph0y> thanks JonahSchulte1!
[08:38:32] <JonahSchulte1> haha, no prob
[08:38:56] <[S]olet> what's the short way of saying document.getElementById("foo").getElementsByClassName("bar")[0]
[08:39:24] <[S]olet> is it just $("#foo").(".bar")[0] ?
[08:39:37] <VeryNoob> i can get it to auto load .html from my seperate page.. but it wont form into the Masonry
[08:39:40] <VeryNoob> does anyone know why?
[08:39:42] <VeryNoob> http://pastebin.com/vpuW3ki0
[08:42:44] <VeryNoob> anyone please? :(
[08:43:57] <NodeX> whats the error?
[08:45:14] <VeryNoob> there no error, it loads the html, but when it does, its not populating into the Masonry
[08:45:15] <VeryNoob> http://pastebin.com/vpuW3ki0
[08:46:34] <[S]olet> verynoob: normally i'd look, but tbh i've been up for a day straight coding. i'm too tired to parse 4 languages at once and be of any use :P
[08:46:52] <VeryNoob> lol
[08:47:11] <VeryNoob> its basically getting the new images into the masonry div
[08:47:17] <VeryNoob> i just dont understand how to do it..
[08:47:24] <VeryNoob> php and everything else works fine
[08:47:34] <VeryNoob> it loads when you reach bottom of page
[08:47:50] <VeryNoob> no errors, its just getting it into this div that is confusing to me
[08:47:57] <[S]olet> if you wanna chop it out into just the html and js and throw it into that js sandbox >.>
[08:48:20] <[S]olet> then i -might- be of some help :P
[08:48:29] <VeryNoob> ok cool
[08:48:31] <VeryNoob> hold on
[08:48:34] <VeryNoob> js sandbox?
[08:48:52] <VeryNoob> jsfiddle?
[08:53:12] <fRAiLtY-> shoky:  :O
[08:53:26] <VeryNoob> Solet
[08:53:27] <VeryNoob> http://jsfiddle.net/KDFMK/1/
[08:54:55] <null__> How do I apply the $(this).css to only the existing text, and not the appended separator? http://jsfiddle.net/kqt9e/
[08:55:19] <VeryNoob> my issue is appending the new html to the masonry container
[08:55:34] <VeryNoob> http://jsfiddle.net/KDFMK/3/
[08:55:42] <VeryNoob> http://pastebin.com/vpuW3ki0
[08:56:39] <Solet> verynoob, so you basically want an unending scrollthrough of images grabbing the next set after set?
[08:56:48] <VeryNoob> ye
[08:56:49] <VeryNoob> yes
[08:59:49] <VeryNoob> Solet, it calls the other images from more.php correctly so thats not an issue. i believe this is soley JQuery
[09:02:50] <Solet> uhhh
[09:03:14] <Solet> page = 0 followed by page*20
[09:03:20] <Solet> isnt it always going to be 0?
[09:05:41] <Solet> wait nvm
[09:06:04] <Solet> k. i've never done ajax with jquery >.> soooo... have you tried to throw an alert to show the return data to make sure you're getting what you wanted to get?
[09:06:10] <ry4nn> anyone know how i can query for the presence of a selector? like i want all elements with a "data-foo" defined
[09:07:28] <ry4nn> nevermind
[09:08:34] <Solet> verynoob try html.appendTo(#yourdiv) instead of the other way around? also try alerting html, see if its just text or if it reads it as elements >.>
[09:09:11] <VeryNoob> sorry yes i have done an alert, it does return the html from more.php
[09:09:33] <VeryNoob> it returns the images, not text
[09:09:39] <VeryNoob> let me try html.appendTo
[09:10:55] <VeryNoob> Solet : that actually broke it
[09:11:13] <VeryNoob> it has to do with this Masonry plug in, and im new to JQuery in general so its confusing
[09:11:26] <VeryNoob> Solet: http://masonry.desandro.com/docs/methods.html#appended
[09:13:16] <Solet> oh
[09:13:18] <Solet> idk =/
[09:13:36] <Solet> does masonry just do lazyscrolling or are you using it for other stuff
[09:13:46] <Solet> cause if its just your lazyscroll, jscroll.com also has a good one
[09:14:05] <Solet> i havent gotten to the lazyscroll portion of the project i'm working on yet >.>
[09:15:39] <VeryNoob> im using an infinite scroll my friend made for me
[09:16:00] <VeryNoob> i just dont understand how Masonrys Append works
[09:16:11] <VeryNoob> im sure i need to use it, i just dont know how :( Solet
[09:17:02] <Solet> i dunno =/ sorry
[09:17:21] <Solet> i honestly dont have the time/focus to go read through a whole plugin to figure it out :(
[09:17:47] <Solet> i'm sitting here learning jquery as we speak, just started playing with it a few hours ago, before that i've always coded js longhand
[09:18:46] <VeryNoob> aw ok
[09:18:56] <VeryNoob> because this is the last thing i need to do :(
[09:19:09] <VeryNoob> cant figure it out for the life of me
[09:21:20] <webdev> hello all.
[09:30:42] <BillCriswell> Are you THE webdev?
[09:32:30] <andornaut> Hi. I have a backbonejs app where my jquery ajax error callback gets invoked if I try to make several requests in quick succession (such as refreshing very quickly). This only happens if I send a 2nd request before the first finished (all reqs complete in <200ms). If I just perform the same request in a browser (it's a simple GET) then it'll works fine. Any ideas?
[09:34:14] <VeryNoob> can anyone help me with Masonry + Infinite Scroll PLEASE
[09:39:08] <Solet> can some one tell me what is wrong with $("#foo" > ".bar").css("display","none"); if i'm trying to put display:none on the element with class bar inside the element id foo?
[09:39:40] <quicksilver> Solet: the closing quote after #foo and the opening quote befor .bar
[09:39:52] <quicksilver> $("#foo > .bar") is what you want
[09:41:30] <webdev> BillCriswell: Yes I am
[09:41:48] <BillCriswell> webdev: Nice.
[09:41:58] <BillCriswell> webdev: And hello, by the way.
[09:42:01] <Solet> quicksilver: thanks!!! out of curiousity, if i by chance had 3 .bar's, and i wanted just the 2nd one how would i select that?
[09:42:10] <webdev> hello
[09:42:39] <Solet> in long form it'd be document.getElementById('foo').getElementsByClassName('bar')[1]
[09:42:43] <Solet> what is that in jquery?
[09:43:02] <BillCriswell> Solet: $('.bar:eq(3)') or $('.bar').eq(2)... might be 3 as well, always forget which is zero based... if any.
[09:43:04] <Eviltwin> $("#foo .bar").eq(1)
[09:43:26] <BillCriswell> Oh he asked for second not third.
[09:43:46] <Solet> awesome. ty
[09:44:11] <sporkf> moin.
[09:44:37] <Solet> can i select several sets of parent>child? like $('a > b', 'c > d', 'e > f').stuff here to do?
[09:44:50] <BillCriswell> Solet: Don't need the quotes, but sure.
[09:44:54] <Eviltwin> You use commas inside the quotes
[09:45:00] <Eviltwin> $('a > b, c > d, e > f')
[09:45:16] <sporkf> when $.ajax() sets jqXHR.status to = 0, is it always the result of some networking error ? correct?  In otherwords, are there any other conditions than network connectivity that would return 0?
[09:45:18] <BillCriswell> $('a > b, c > d, e > f')
[09:45:19] <Solet> what about a set of children b c and d that belong to parent a?
[09:45:31] <Eviltwin> $('a').children('b, c, d')
[09:45:42] <Solet> cool
[09:46:06] <Eviltwin> sporkf: I believe it uses status 0 for file:// requests as well
[09:46:20] <Solet> .children wasnt on the jquery "selectors" page >.< is there an exhaustive list somewhere?
[09:46:40] <sporkf> Eviltwin: thanks.  Is there any documentation to assert this?
[09:46:49] <Eviltwin> It's not a selector
[09:46:49] <Eviltwin> It's a method
[09:46:50] <Eviltwin> api.jquery.com/children
[09:47:35] <Eviltwin> sporkf: I suggest looking here: http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/
[09:47:46] <Eviltwin> Or trying it
[09:49:05] <cusco> hi
[09:50:55] <sporkf> Eviltwin: is there a way to distinguish, if the underlining socket $.ajax wraps returns to it a networking error?
[09:53:08] <RobLoach> scott_gonzalez: I know people have likely approached you with this, but what are your thoughts on splitting out sub-trees of the jQuery UI components? https://github.com/RobLoach/jquery.ui.widget .... This allows dependencies to be declared via node.
[09:53:36] <scott_gonzalez> RobLoach: Maintainence nightmare.
[09:54:44] <scott_gonzalez> We'd have about 40 repos.
[09:54:50] <RobLoach> :-)
[10:02:36] <VeryNoob> can anyone help with Masonry + Infinite Scroll please?? http://pastebin.com/vpuW3ki0
[10:02:43] <andornaut> $.get() requests in quick succession (2nd fire before 1st completes) causes my error callback to be hit. Not much help in the jqHXR. No server errors, same test works fine via browser (or wget, etc). Any ideas?
[10:09:16] <Eviltwin> andornaut: Have you used the WebKit Inspector or Firebug to inspect the network traffic?
[10:10:17] <pHero> hello why doesnt .trigger('change') trigger the change event?
[10:10:46] <pHero> $('[name=project]').trigger('change'); and i have $('[name=project]').change(function(event) { ...... }
[10:16:02] <Eviltwin> pHero: http://jsfiddle.net/kcWM7/
[10:24:55] <RobLoach> scott_gonzalez: If the components were split into their own sub-directories, then it could be automated: http://ur1.ca/ai6up ... Symfony does it: http://github.com/symfony ... I agree it's not something that should happen right now though.
[10:31:36] <andornaut> Eviltwin: yep. Using Chrom dev tools, it shows an empty response
[10:31:44] <andornaut> *Chrome
[10:32:14] <zsoc> hm... I have a query function that's structured like $('.class').hover(function()).click(function())  - How would I trigger this without a hover/click filtering by id? I tried something like ll('.class').filter('#id').trigger('hover').trigger('click'); ...
[10:32:31] <VeryNoob> can anyone help me with Masonry + Infinite Scroll please???
[10:32:57] <andornaut> That's just the thing. I can send tons of requests over using a browser, script, etc, but as soon as I try the same using $.ajax() I get an empty response, IFF the requests overlap (2nd sent before 1st completes) - and it looks to be client-side :_/
[10:34:09] <VeryNoob> anyone please
[10:34:19] <VeryNoob> im new to javascript and this is the last thing i need to finish my page
[10:34:20] <VeryNoob> http://pastebin.com/gaxqWsc7
[10:36:00] <Kambfhase> zsoc: you can give your funtions a name and just call them on the element
[10:36:25] <zsoc> Kambfhase, oh. hm. i will see if i can wrap my brain around that.
[10:37:01] <Solet> found a page that said for easy counting of all elements returned by a selector make $.fn.count = function(selector) { return this.filter(selector).length; }
[10:37:45] <BillCriswell> Solet:
[10:37:46] <Solet> but then you have to go $(".stuff").count($(".stuff")), its annoying, is there a way to make it just do $(".stuff").count(); and get it?
[10:38:01] <BillCriswell> Solet: $('.foo').length
[10:38:47] <Solet> no need for filter?
[10:39:02] <BillCriswell> Solet: Not unless you don't need everything that's selected.
[10:39:11] <andornaut> Eviltwin: what's weirder is that Chrome Dev Tools doesn't classify the failing request as XHR, instead it's shown in the "Other" tab... The ones that succeed are listed in the XHR section... something isn't right :-/
[10:39:30] <Solet> what do you mean "dont need"?
[10:40:01] <BillCriswell> Solet: filter() is only there to filter out items.
[10:40:09] <Solet> oh
[10:40:42] <andornaut> Eviltwin: and even weirder, the problem goes away if I set async: false
[10:40:44] <BillCriswell> Solet: http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[10:41:05] <chowmain> how do i make the complete function of .animate to run only once
[10:41:06] <Solet> *nod* already there
[10:41:26] <chowmain> i have a logging mechanism for some counters
[10:41:46] <zsoc> Kambfhase, I think it's outside of scope.... my function is written like $('.class').hover.click(function needthisone()) but I can't call $('#id').needthisone()
[10:41:47] <chowmain> and it seems like every time the animate function is triggered
[10:41:52] <chowmain> it's ran twice
[10:42:28] <Kambfhase> zsoc: well, you have to do function name(){...} $('.class').click(name) ... then
[10:43:04] <zsoc> kambfhase gotcha, and that will work even if it's "deeper"? Ie not .click(name) but .hover().click(name)?
[10:43:30] <Kambfhase> yes, name is just a reference to that function.
[10:43:30] <danheberden> your function can also check the event type
[10:43:37] <Kambfhase> JS is a functional language!
[10:43:38] <zsoc> Kambfhase, ty very much
[10:43:45] <zsoc> Kambfhase, i'm not used to that! haha
[10:44:22] <Kambfhase> yeah, its quite useful
[10:45:39] <sporkf> Is there a value/function in jqXHR, that signifies if the underliying call to the socket's connect() failed?
[10:46:05] <zsoc> Kambfhase, hmm.. .click(function selectme() {...} and then im doing $('#id').click(selectme); and i'm getting "selectme is not defined"
[10:46:25] <Kambfhase> yeah, that doesnt work.
[10:46:38] <zsoc> Kambfhase, yes, it definately doesn't.
[10:47:01] <Kambfhase> you have to move the entire function declaration to the top of your code/scope/whatever
[10:47:26] <zsoc> ah ok
[10:48:23] <Kambfhase> Oh, http://webplatform.org/ launched today. I can't find an entry for jQuery, though.
[10:48:26] <Kambfhase> weird.
[10:49:08] <zsoc> Kambfhase, someone dun goofed
[10:49:09] <Solet> is there a faster way to say $(this).css('z-index', $(this).css('z-index')-1); ?
[10:50:03] <Kambfhase> Solet: $(this).css('z-index',function(i, value){ return value -1; })
[10:50:33] <BillCriswell> Kambfhase: Nice. Never knew that about that.
[10:51:16] <Kambfhase> passing in function was added in 1.4, I guess.
[10:51:31] <Kambfhase> (or it was very limited before)
[10:51:39] <Solet> sorry for all the weird "how do i say this better" questions, i'm learning jquery today cause i'm too tired to do other stuffs :P figure best way to learn is to keep refining it down and learning various ways of saying and doing things
[10:52:40] <BillCriswell> Kambfhase: Ah, makes sense.
[10:52:58] <BillCriswell> Kambfhase: webplatform.org definitely still needs some work.
[10:53:05] <zsoc> Kambfhase, oh, the .trigger() works, i just have to do it after its bound. I keep forgetting .click() is a shortcut for a bind :) thank you!
[10:55:39] <BillCriswell> Kambfhase: Just learned that #webplatform on freenode exists.
[11:03:39] <sporkf> what are all the values for jqXHR.statusText ? http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ doesn't list them.
[11:04:47] <johnkpaul> sporkf: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-ajax-textstatus-documented
[11:06:24] <sporkf> johnkpaul: thanks, but that doesn't provide descriptions.
[11:07:15] <johnkpaul> sporkf: which one do you have a question about?
[11:07:55] <sporkf> well succes is obvious, but I want to know when there's a fail for the underlying connect() and read() and write() on its socket.
[11:08:18] <johnkpaul> sporkf: that would be error
[11:08:35] <sporkf> what does timeout, notmodified, and parsererror mean?
[11:08:51] <johnkpaul> notmodified is the http status code
[11:09:12] <johnkpaul> timeout is when the response hasn't returned after the timeout
[11:09:17] <johnkpaul> parser error is the only jquery specific one
[11:09:21] <sporkf> so if there is a returned status code, say 400, it will be assigned notmodified?
[11:09:38] <johnkpaul> it's when there's an error in converting the data from the http response into the type requested in the dataType option
[11:09:51] <johnkpaul> no, sporkf, notmodified is 30something
[11:09:59] <johnkpaul> 304
[11:10:05] <sporkf> oh ok.
[11:12:42] <sporkf> johnkpaul: when you said, --> 14:09 < johnkpaul> it's when there's an error in converting the data from the  http response into the type requested in the dataType option
[11:12:51] <sporkf>  were you refering to notmodified ?
[11:12:53] <johnkpaul> no
[11:12:56] <johnkpaul> parseerror
[11:12:59] <sporkf> thanks
[11:13:01] <johnkpaul> np
[11:13:21] <johnkpaul> everything other that parseerror has nothing to do with jquery internals
[11:13:24] <johnkpaul> it's just pure http stuff
[11:13:46] <atxq> how can I move a selected option up/down?
[11:15:04] <sporkf> johnkpaul: I understand it's assigned "error" on socket call of connect(), but how do you know "error" is also called durring read() or write() on the socket?  I.e. if ajax request was "cut off"?
[11:15:35] <VeryNoob> i need help making my infinite scroll work please.... http://pastebin.com/gaxqWsc7
[11:16:05] <johnkpaul> sporkf: I don't think that XHR gives you that kind of detail
[11:16:30] <johnkpaul> ?g mdn xhr
[11:16:31] <bot-t> johnkpaul, XMLHttpRequest | Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest
[11:16:38] <johnkpaul> ^@ sporkf
[11:17:03] <johnkpaul> if you want to look through the lower level stuff, it's all there, there seems to be an "abort" that jQuery doesnt' surface, but I don't think that's as granular as you want either
[11:18:56] <VeryNoob> can someone take a look please? http://pastebin.com/gaxqWsc7
[11:21:33] <VeryNoob> http://pastebin.com/gaxqWsc7
[11:22:09] <bolle> I want to append some content loaded from a url to a div... is there something like $myDiv.load("/my/url/page.html") which will allow me to append content instead of replacing content?
[11:22:13] <sporkf> johnkpaul: I'll just test by cutting it off by hitting reload button on browser.
[11:24:35] <VeryNoob> .append() bolle
[11:25:33] <VeryNoob> $('#mydiv).append(html)
[11:26:50] <bolle> VeryNoob: but .append() will work for something like .append("<div>some content</div>") .... i want to append the content loaded from a url
[11:27:49] <bolle> VeryNoob: can you use .append() like .append("/some/url/which/contains/html/content.html") ?
[11:27:54] <bolle> VeryNoob: I didn't think so
[11:28:10] <Kambfhase> you might just have to do a proper Ajax call and append the result
[11:28:25] <VeryNoob> .ajax then append
[11:29:03] <bolle> Kambfhase: okay, i'll try that
[11:29:06] <bolle> VeryNoob: Thanks
[11:29:09] <vacho> $('tr[data-asset-status-id="'+asset_status_id+'"] td[data-type="'+type+'"]').css("background", "#7FFFD4");
[11:29:11] <vacho> how come that works..
[11:29:45] <vacho> but not this: $('tr[data-asset-status-id="'+asset_status_id+'"] td[data-type="'+type+'"]').effect("#7FFFD4", {}, 3000);
[11:30:35] <Woet> ?demo @ vacho
[11:30:35] <bot-t> vacho, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:31:05] <Woet> vacho: but most likely because "7FFFD4" is not an effect?
[11:31:08] <sporkf> is there a way to determine if an ajax call cant connect because a bad network connection, say server is down, vs end user hitting reload button on browser ?
[11:31:26] <Woet> vacho: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/effect
[11:31:36] <johnkpaul> sporkf: no, I don't believe there is

[11:34:25] <Woet> sporkf: "A function to be called if the request fails. [..] Possible values for the second argument (besides null) are "timeout", "error", "abort", and "parsererror"."

[11:36:06] <greedo> is there a way to listen for a http response when a link is clicked?
[11:36:19] <greedo> so I bind to click
[11:36:47] <greedo> but what else should I do?
[11:37:13] <johnkpaul> greedo: you mean you want to run some code when the user laves the page?
[11:37:18] <johnkpaul> ?g mdn onbeforeunload @ greedo
[11:37:19] <bot-t> greedo, window.onbeforeunload | Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.onbeforeunload
[11:38:00] <VeryNoob> johnkpaul, can you help me?
[11:38:12] <greedo> johnkpaul: kinda, basically the link triggers a csv download
[11:39:12] <greedo> johnkpaul: then I send a 204 if no data exists to generate the download
[11:39:37] <greedo> but I want some popup if there is no data
[11:40:12] <johnkpaul> greedo: hmm, you'll need two requests
[11:40:14] <johnkpaul> one to ask if there is data
[11:40:19] <johnkpaul> and one to get it if it is there
[11:40:47] <Krambiorix> Woet, you like demos huh?
[11:41:19] <andornaut> In my chrome extension, if I refresh quickly enough to cause overlapping ajax requests, one of them will fail. There are no errors on the server, looks to be purely on the client side. Chrome Dev Tools reports the failed request as "Other" instead of "XHR", with an empty response. Anyone have any ideas?
[11:42:19] <Solet> i want to go through #id1 #id2 #id27 #id17 #id8 (they are in that order in the document (or easily could be) and are named that. i want to find the lowest unclaimed number (we know its 3 by looking at example) and return it. any ideas?
[11:42:38] <andornaut> I noticed that the Status is "(cancelled)" and the type is "Pending" - is there any way to skip these "canceled" errors in my error callback?
[11:43:19] <vacho> Woet: they argument is askign for a css color code, not an effect.
[11:43:27] <Solet> so far i have: $("div").each(function() { var test=$(this).attr('id').substring(2); } //i got the number but since they're not in order i'm not sure how to check them
[11:43:36] <Woet> vacho: since when? http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/effect
[11:43:42] <Woet> vacho: The effect to be used. Possible values: 'blind', 'bounce', 'clip', 'drop', 'explode', 'fold', 'highlight', 'puff', 'pulsate', 'scale', 'shake', 'size', 'slide', 'transfer'.
[11:45:45] <bolle> VeryNoob: I have appended the ajax call like you suggested. However, I must be doing something wrong because its not working. the ajax call is successful, but it seems like I need to do somethign extra to append the repsonse. I'm currently calling it like so : $myDiv.append($j.ajax({ url : "someContent.html" }))
[11:46:33] <Krambiorix> Woet, here you are my dear : http://jsfiddle.net/LPMHy/1/
[11:47:00] <vacho> Woet: sorry mate, you are so right!
[11:47:17] <john_nash> hi i tried using jquri dialog to pop up a small modal dialog , that it does but it shows itself in html page as well .. do i have to hide it in document.load or something or is it something that i did wrong?
[11:47:34] <Kambfhase> Solet: $('div').filter('[id^="id"]').map(function(i,value){ return +(this.id.substr(2)); }).get()
[11:47:44] <bolle> VeryNoob: Seems like I need a success function in my ajax call in order to actually do something with the repsonse ?
[11:47:56] <Woet> Krambiorix: you picked mootools on the left, not jquery.
[11:48:15] <vacho> Woet: do u know how I can change default color yellow to something else?
[11:48:32] <andornaut> Im actually reasonably sure that this is a bug. the jqXHR statusText should probably be abort, not error. Workaround: http://ilikestuffblog.com/2009/11/30/how-to-distinguish-a-user-aborted-ajax-call-from-an-error/
[11:50:00] <sporkf> andornaut: Is that for me?!?!?!?!?! :)
[11:50:07] <Krambiorix> Woet, hmmm in the fiddle it works, but on my computer i tdoesn't
[11:50:18] <andornaut> sporkf: nope
[11:50:22] <bolle> VeryNoob: Nevermind! I figured it out
[11:50:28] <Woet> Krambiorix: which is I insist on using demos :) something else is breaking it.
[11:50:38] <andornaut> sporkf: err, potentially =)
[11:50:39] <sporkf> andornaut: well I'm at the right place at the right time.  This is exactly what I'm looking for.
[11:50:48] <andornaut> nice
[11:50:58] <Krambiorix> Woet, can you come to my house and check it?
[11:51:00] <Kambfhase> Solet: http://jsfiddle.net/sANWW/
[11:51:12] <Woet> vacho: for which effect?
[11:51:15] <john_nash> got it .. thanks anyway
[11:52:16] <vacho> 'highlight' ... would like it to go to green rather than yellow.
[11:55:43] <Krambiorix> WOet, what could be breaking this?
[11:58:49] <JFranks> I've asked before, and I never get a reply: "How can I get a 100% local copy of the theme switcher? When I put it on local (LAN) pages it takes a few seconds to fetch remote files and some days it's so bad I have to disable it."
[11:59:18] <Heather_> whats the best way to declare an array when your going to "array_push" values into it throught a specific page?
[11:59:33] <Heather_> through out*
[11:59:34] <Kambfhase> []
[11:59:56] <greedo> johnkpaul: two requests seem like too much overhead
[12:00:09] <Kambfhase> [ /* look at me i am an empty array! */ ]
[12:00:11] <Heather_> Kambfhase where in the script?
[12:00:32] <Heather_> oh nvm okay
[12:00:35] <Heather_> thanks
[12:00:38] <Kambfhase> :)
[12:00:47] <JFranks> Heather: I've never liked global vars.. when I do I just attach them to the window object so "var varname.window = 'foo';"
[12:03:04] <johnkpaul> greedo: I'd love to hear if you come up with another way, but I am pretty confident that you can't do it in one
[12:03:10] <Heather_> JFranks so that declares a variable for the specific page?
[12:03:13] <johnkpaul> well, that's not true, if you're in a browser that supports the download attribute
[12:03:18] <andornaut> anyway: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12675 hope it gets some love
[12:03:24] <johnkpaul> then I suppose you can fake it
[12:03:43] <dmcdaniel12> Hi folks. I need to use jquery to grab some info from a table that looks like this: http://pastebin.com/xGghFNYa. How would I do this? I've tried using $('.data-table'). But I am not sure exactly how to pull the information out of td if ONLY it meets the table head SKU.
[12:04:26] <tw2113> $('th.label').val ?
[12:04:40] <Kambfhase> dmcdaniel12: http://api.jquery.com/next-adjacent-Selector/
[12:04:46] <greedo> johnkpaul: ugh, I'm got to think of a way
[12:04:58] <larzen> folks... i have a little jquery app that fixed positions div blocks along the top (like a grid) .. but its quite slow in firefox... as in, you can see a clear delay when resizing the browser.
[12:05:04] <johnkpaul> greedo: why?
[12:05:07] <larzen> i can see the blocks "sliding" into place.
[12:05:37] <Kambfhase> Who resizes their browser?
[12:05:41] <dmcdaniel12> tw2113 - im assuming if I do that I would need to do an each.(function() and then do a if=sku then td.val?
[12:05:47] <mowol> hi. I wanna do something like $('#id1 #id2') or similar while 'this' is for the #id2. How do i do that? If i use find or children inside of just $('#id1') i think 'this' still refers to #id1
[12:05:49] <johnkpaul> greedo: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4485182/force-download-for-blob-created-with-filewriter-in-javascript
[12:05:53] <tw2113> potentially, not sure
[12:06:00] <larzen> has anyone experienced this?
[12:06:05] <dmcdaniel12> tw2113 - thanks. I will give that a try.
[12:06:17] <tw2113> may be .html instead of .val
[12:06:20] <tw2113> but worth tinkering with
[12:06:42] <tw2113> and hopefully a step in the right direction
[12:06:42] <Kambfhase> ?has @ mowol
[12:06:43] <bot-t> mowol, .has(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[12:07:00] <larzen> Kambfhase: resizing the window is a standard function... im not sure why this is happening.
[12:07:03] <greedo> johnkpaul: I wonder how well that works
[12:07:19] <johnkpaul> greedo: it doesn't, depending on what browsers you need to support
[12:07:27] <mowol> Kambfhase: thanks i'll try :)
[12:07:46] <dmcdaniel12> tw2113, that is a step in the right direction. Thanks
[12:08:10] <Kambfhase> no one ever resizes its browser window
[12:12:41] <someprimetime_> is there a reason why slideDown() and slideUp() all add overflow: hidden; after applying it to a dom object?
[12:12:50] <someprimetime_> s/dom object/dom element
[12:23:47] <andornaut> sporkf: that workaround doesn't actually work all that well. If the server is down, there won't be any Response Headers, and you won't be able to tell if it was an error or abort
[12:23:55] <jdolan> can jquery return a unique selector for a given element?
[12:24:07] <andornaut> sporkf: it's the workaround I'm using now, as it's better than nothing, but we'll just have to hope that it gets fixed in jquery sometime soon =)
[12:24:31] <DukeDrake> hi
[12:24:32] <jdolan> say i issue a selector and receive an array.. can i conveniently get just the selector for the nth element?
[12:24:32] <sporkf> andornaut: I just noticed that by putting my web server down. thanks but I also need to know if there are ligit network connectivity errors too.
[12:24:57] <DukeDrake> Does jQuery have the .input()  event?
[12:25:05] <andornaut> sporkf: i think we're both out of luck until it's fixed
[12:25:26] <andornaut> sporkf: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12675
[12:25:41] <sporkf> andornaut: I'm currently researching jqXHR.readyState
[12:25:57] <sporkf> andornaut: oh thanks for showing me the bug ticket, at least I have something to look forward to.
[12:26:01] <andornaut> sporkf: if you find something, let me know pls
[12:26:20] <sporkf> ditto
[12:27:22] <andornaut> sporkf: will do. My feeling is that this is a regression, b/c the docs mention 'timeout' and 'abort' statuses, but the only one that seems to get returned is "error" (at least in chrome 22)
[12:27:23] <Kambfhase> ?change @ DukeDrake
[12:27:23] <bot-t> DukeDrake, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[12:29:20] <DukeDrake> Kambfhase: ok
[12:29:25] <sporkf> andornaut: what's a regression?
[12:29:34] <DukeDrake> I want input though ^^
[12:29:37] <DukeDrake> never mind ^^
[12:30:19] <andornaut> sporkf: nvm, i just figured that it might have worked at some point (hence the documentation), but Im not so sure anymore
[12:31:14] <mowol> Kambfhase: sorry to say it, but it still doesnt work. Its this im trying to do: $('#modules-blocklampesearcher-filter').has('#product_list li').hide().filter(function() { something });
[12:32:22] <Kambfhase> mowol: an you give me more centext, may be even provide some code? see ?p
[12:32:23] <bot-t> mowol, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:34:22] <mowol> Kambfhase: something like this: http://pastebin.com/aqEN77n9
[12:34:58] <Kambfhase> mkay
[12:36:08] <Kambfhase> random question: why do you want to check if your #modules-foo contains a #productlist ?
[12:36:34] <mowol> because it should only work when im on a specific page (its prestashop). And prestashop puts the id of the page in the body tag.
[12:37:41] <Kambfhase> mkay
[12:38:09] <mowol> so it should work when <body id="mymodule"></body> is there, and not when <body id="othermodule"></body> is there
[12:39:15] <Kambfhase> and you want to hide the li, when its associated price is >10 or so?
[12:40:10] <mowol> the function works if i just use $('#product_list li')
[12:40:20] <mowol> but then it will work on all pages, which it shouldnt
[12:41:30] <Kambfhase> mowol: why not use an if statement? http://pastebin.com/gWVUhJn1
[12:43:45] <andornaut> sporkf: here's a workaround that may help you: http://jsfiddle.net/vLrYm/7/ (I can't use it since backbonejs is doing the ajax calls (via jquery) and it'd be too much of a pain to hack that workaround in there
[12:44:17] <andornaut> sporkf: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11666421/jquery-ajax-request-abort-in-chrome
[12:44:32] <mowol> Kambfhase: good idea, but now i found out why the other solution doesnt work. The length always returns 0, so its like jquery cant find the id
[12:44:45] <Kambfhase> correct
[12:45:08] <mowol> ofcrouse
[12:45:15] <mowol> that's what happens when you misspell the ID
[12:45:21] <Kambfhase> :D
[12:45:33] <mowol> thanks for your help Kambfhase

[12:58:37] <Solet> when doing $(".thing").each(function($(this).css('color')) { doing stuff } ); // is there a way inside function() to tell it to pass $(this).css('color') as a var, like... ourColor? so that inside the function i can reference ourColor?
[13:00:04] <Cork> Solet: no, you need to store that variable your self
[13:00:14] <Cork> just set it before you run the loop
[13:00:31] <Solet> but... it'll change with every pass through the loop
[13:01:11] <Cork> Solet: so store jquery object
[13:01:16] <Cork> var $self = $(this);
[13:04:48] <Solet> so i var $thingy=$(this).css('color'); $(".thing").each(function() { stuff where $thingy will give me current css color }); ??
[13:08:01] <larzen> So anyone using the css3 transition effect ... this will KILL the resize performance.
[13:09:56] <Cork> Solet: no
[13:10:13] <Cork> Solet: if you change the value of css color, you need to query the value each time
[13:10:24] <Cork> Solet: or store it in a cache (a variable)
[13:10:44] <Solet> i'm looping through a bunch of elements, lets say i'm looking for the one where css color is red
[13:11:12] <Solet> so i wanna have if(ourColor=='red') (i realize it doesnt return as the word red)
[13:11:29] <Cork> Solet: wait a min, i might have over-through what you mean
[13:11:31] <Kambfhase> you know, red is a valid color
[13:12:05] <Cork> Solet: is $(this) meant to be the value from the $('.thing') selector?
[13:12:12] <Solet> i doubt when you ask for .css('color') it will come back 'red' it'll prolly come back RGB('255', '0', '0')
[13:12:14] <Solet> or something silly
[13:12:31] <Cork> depends on the browser
[13:12:41] <Solet> $(this) is the current itterated item in the each loop
[13:12:46] <Solet> it always is
[13:12:51] <Solet> it does that on its own
[13:13:07] <Cork> oook, so why don't you just use $(this).css('color') then?
[13:13:30] <Cork> Solet: i'm trying to figure out what it is your trying to do
[13:13:44] <Cork> or rather what your really asking about
[13:14:01] <Solet> inside the each() loop, i wan to refer to a few of the current elements attributes with easy names
[13:14:53] <Cork> uh.. css doens't fetch attributes
[13:15:07] <Cork> its for the style tag (plus inherited values from the css file)
[13:15:15] <Kambfhase> Cork: do not take his words literally
[13:15:15] <Solet> would be truely awesome if it was like $(.class).each(function($(this).css('color'), $(this).css('font-size')) {  //inside here $1 is the color and $2 is the font size }); or something
[13:15:30] <Solet> i'm not always using css, i'm looking for several things
[13:15:37] <Cork> Solet: no you need to grab them from this
[13:15:41] <Solet> css('color') is the shortest one to type
[13:15:51] <Cork> Solet: function($() doesn't make sense
[13:15:55] <zsoc> i am enjoying this discussion
[13:16:01] <Solet> i'm simplifying my example to figure out if its possible
[13:16:08] <Cork> that would try to create $(this).css('color') variables
[13:16:17] <Cork> its not
[13:16:23] <Solet> kk
[13:16:31] <Cork> var color = $(this).css('color');
[13:16:39] <Kambfhase> $('.class').each(function(){ var thisColor = $(this).css('color'); /* use thisColor here */ })
[13:17:20] <Cork> Solet: at first i though you wanted to have access to a parent element (like this from an event loop)
[13:17:42] <Cork> uh... sorry parent scope, not element
[13:22:52] <brian_> Hey guys, i was looking some help, on 4chan if you hover over a link you get a popup of what that link points too. Was wondering how they do that, since the links are added by users, they cant be hardcoded to pop up a pre set div, so how do they generate it?
[13:23:20] <Kambfhase> theres a benalman plugin for that
[13:23:36] <zsoc> brian_, i have a general rule to avoid mimicking anything i see on 4chan

[13:24:09] <brian_> i know the idea of a pop up div thats hard coded
[13:24:19] <brian_> but when the contect is added by others, how could they do it.

[15:07:52] <Krinkle> I don't believe there is
[15:07:57] <Krinkle> There is #jquery-dev however.
[15:08:18] <Danielss89> ok, i'll try there :)
[15:08:31] <Krinkle> Since QUnit is mostly for more involved developers (not so much users of jQuery that write simple scripts from an abstract level), we don't have a channel for it yet.
[15:08:45] <Krinkle> jquery-dev are the developers of jQuery core and other projects (including QUnit)

[15:54:51] <fkm> Is there a way to flush changes to jQuery DOM object to the DOM? I'm trying to make a carousel/slider but somehow the changes won't read the DOM :-\
[15:54:52] <fkm> http://verena.snemelk.ch/arbeiten/szene/koenigin_der_farben
[15:56:26] <fkm> The changes to the carouselContainer are visible in the console.log but not in the "Elements" view of Chromium.
[15:59:44] <vacho> eddiemonge: thank u sir!
[16:00:53] <eddiemonge> fkm:  say what?
[16:01:34] <clondike> fkm: i'm not seeing where carouselContainer is actually added to the DOM
[16:01:51] <fkm> carouselList.wrap(carouselContainer);
[16:02:00] <fkm> Line 41
[16:03:03] <fkm> I need the DIV around the list to attach the preview image. But I don't want it in the initial HTML.
[16:03:48] <Solet> in the click event, is there a handle for the element that i clicked?
[16:03:58] <clondike> when i right click on the element that you send to the console log, and choose "show in elements panel" it doesn't appear in the page
[16:04:04] <clondike> it's like a detached node or something
[16:04:09] <clondike> floating in hyperspace
[16:04:21] <fkm> Yeah! Which is odd.
[16:04:37] <fkm> I was wondering, if the two-level jQuery.fn might have something to do with that.
[16:04:37] <tw2113> freaky
[16:05:53] <clondike> i've never used wrap with an element, only a string
[16:05:57] <clondike> it claims to be supported
[16:07:07] <mib_mib> how can i search text using a regular expression?

[16:13:15] <Foxhoundz> Hello jQuery
[16:13:43] <jude0> hello back
[16:17:31] <fkm> Seems the changes to the carouselContainer make it to the jQuery.fn.carousel. That's a start :-D
[16:20:04] <mDemocritus> No questions, just wanted to tell you guys that I love jQuery. just recently found it, i hope i never have to use normal javascript again
[16:20:35] <tw2113> what's wrong with normal javascript?
[16:21:07] <shoky> s/normal javascript/native DOM API/
[16:21:40] <tw2113> i'd wager jquery goes out of style before javascript/native DOM API
[16:22:18] <shoky> it won't be the same API tho
[16:22:34] <clondike> jQuery has already mutated the DOM API
[16:22:51] <clondike> querySelectorAll() ?
[16:22:53] <clondike> so jQuery
[16:24:14] <shoky> anyway, we all know what we're all talking about, so that's good

[16:32:15] <clondike> you are very welcome. good luck!
[16:33:05] <rend> how can I import/include a js library in a js file?
[16:33:23] <tw2113> <script src="PATH TO JQUERY.JS"></script>
[16:33:38] <tw2113> or whatever the name of the js file is
[16:33:38] <rend> I thought that works in html code
[16:33:44] <tw2113> it does
[16:33:54] <tw2113> in the <head> or right before the closing </body>
[16:33:57] <rend> tw2113: I'm talking about file.js that wants to use jquery.js
[16:34:02] <tw2113> or if you're daring, elsewhere in the <body>
[16:34:15] <clondike> ?getScript
[16:34:15] <bot-t> jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[16:34:15] <tw2113> file.js i assume relies on jquery.js
[16:34:30] <tw2113> didn't know about getScript
[16:34:38] <tw2113> but just load file.js AFTER the jquery loading
[16:34:39] <rend> that's what I'm talking about
[16:34:53] <rend> but how can I use jQuery in another js file?
[16:34:53] <clondike> getScript() has a success handler which is nice
[16:35:48] <clondike> rend: http://jsfiddle.net/8Yap9/
[16:35:59] <clondike> you can use that function without jQuery
[16:36:59] <rend> clondike: what does the second part do?
[16:37:12] <clondike> it attachs a success handler
[16:37:24] <clondike> so you can add some code to run only once the script is loaded
[16:37:36] <clondike> if you need your code to rely on something in the external file
[16:37:37] <shoky> fkm: i'm not sure but i think the relevant part from the .wrap() docs is:  A **copy** of this structure will be wrapped around each of the elements in the set of matched elements.
[16:37:56] <clondike> shoky++
[16:38:24] <fkm> That would explain thing! :-D
[16:38:53] <fkm> So, I guess I'll have to find a 'normal' way to insert my DIV :-)
[16:39:00] <fkm> Thank you very much shoky!
[16:39:01] <shoky> you can still wrap it
[16:39:13] <tw2113> wrap it before you tap it?
[16:39:14] <tw2113> *runs*
[16:39:15] <shoky> but you need to update your reference to the actual div that is wrapping
[16:39:17] <shoky> ;p
[16:39:30] <fkm> Ah!
[16:39:40] <fkm> I see, I'm still new to this -.-
[16:39:45] <rend> clondike: does local paths work too? '/script/whatever.js'
[16:40:19] <clondike> sure!
[16:40:28] <clondike> it just puts a script tag in the page for you
[16:40:39] <clondike> so whatever is valid as a script src
[16:41:40] <fkm> It's alive! :-D
[16:42:08] <fkm> Thank you again shoky, clondike and tw2113!
[16:42:23] <tw2113> doesn't shoky deserve any credit i somehow got attributed?
[16:42:40] <tw2113> all i did was a sly crude joke
[16:43:48] <shoky> it was much needed tho
[16:44:08] <clondike> esprit de corps
[16:44:30] <shoky> word
[16:50:00] <fkm> tw2113: shoky deserves all the credit for the answer. But clondike deserves credit for looking at the problem and you for reacting to my post. But yes, shory deserves most and I thanked him twice and you two just once ;-)
[16:50:22] * tw2113 gives his credit token to shoky 
[16:51:32] <clondike> well, that's the last time i ever try to help anyone

[16:53:09] <MistuhKurtz> you can have it

[16:54:02] <rend> clondike: but it doesn't load my js files, would you have a look at init.js please?
[16:54:17] <rend> am I doing something very wrong?
[16:54:21] <clondike> rend
[16:54:27] <clondike> you want to pass success as a function
[16:54:31] <clondike> not call it immediately
[16:54:37] <clondike> so replace success() with success)
[16:54:40] <clondike> er
[16:54:42] <rend> ah ok
[16:54:42] <clondike> success
[16:55:07] <clondike> also fix the comment: "form" should be "from"

[16:56:22] <clondike> weird
[16:56:35] <clondike> check in the console that those URLs are actually finding JS
[16:56:37] <clondike> and not HTML
[16:56:46] <rend> how do I check them?
[16:56:47] <clondike> in the net tab, likesay
[16:56:56] <clondike> you should see Success 200 OK
[16:57:03] <clondike> and you can click to see what is actually returned
[16:57:15] <rend> clondike: well it only sees init.js
[16:57:19] <rend> and it's 200 ok
[16:57:33] <rend> it doesn't see any other link I guess because init.js is loading them
[16:57:59] <rend> clondike: is what I'm doing the right way of dealing with js files?
[16:58:55] <rend> clondike: should I use document ready.. ?
[16:59:14] <clondike> well
[16:59:20] <clondike> if you're not using jQuery straight up
[16:59:24] <clondike> that will be tricky
[16:59:36] <clondike> you're better off just moving the <script> to the bottom of the page
[16:59:43] <clondike> the code works for me here http://jsfiddle.net/yYdfL/
[16:59:53] <clondike> that is loading one of jsfiddle's js files
[16:59:59] <clondike> and i had to remove the reference to url in success
[17:00:10] <clondike> because it's not in scope within that function
[17:02:09] <rend> I'm still getting that weird syntaxError
[17:02:21] <rend> I guess there is something wrong with jQuery lib
[17:02:26] <rend> but I downloaded it from google
[17:02:51] <black_warlock> guys any idea on how to read this json ?
[17:02:54] <black_warlock> http://www.gw2spidy.com/gem_chart
[17:03:19] <clondike> rend: from the net tab you should be able to see exactly what was loaded
[17:03:23] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/eq2Kf/2/
[17:03:30] <clondike> and you can see if it looks like sensible JS or bogus XML
[17:04:08] <black_warlock> shoky ?
[17:04:08] <rend> it doesn't show anything
[17:04:49] <clondike> that could be the problem
[17:05:00] <clondike> what happens if you try to access the file in the browser directly?
[17:05:08] <clondike> somedomain.com/lib/jQuery.js
[17:05:09] <tw2113> black_warlock, are you sure it's being sent with json headers?
[17:05:17] <JFranks> Ooh ooo! I found a bug with the new spinner code.. ;)
[17:05:24] <black_warlock> infact i dont know
[17:05:41] <black_warlock> usually there is a string that indicates version
[17:05:56] <black_warlock> but here there isnt
[17:06:04] <MistuhKurtz> there's such a thing as JSON headers?
[17:06:14] <tw2113> headers/content type
[17:06:19] <tw2113> one of those fancy words
[17:06:31] <MistuhKurtz> ah application/json
[17:07:36] <black_warlock> nope
[17:08:25] <black_warlock> but the format looks so
[17:09:25] <tw2113> it's completely possible to put a plain text file on a server that has contents that LOOKS like json
[17:09:34] <tw2113> and would be json if it were served properly like so
[17:09:57] <JFranks> http://jsfiddle.net/AjA4k/1/
[17:10:42] <gnarf> black_warlock: are you trying to load that url from another domain?
[17:10:49] <JFranks> (In my project the spinners are actually blocking some of the dates on the calendar making the date picker broken.. ;p
[17:10:56] <black_warlock> ye
[17:10:56] <gnarf> black_warlock: because that doesn't work -- you'll need a local proxy/copy of the data

[17:15:11] <black_warlock> and the split datas
[17:15:40] <rend> clondike: please have a look, now it doesn't give me any error, but it hasn't loaded https://github.com/pazooki/mindlogger/tree/master/statics/js
[17:17:19] <rend> clondike: that's not possible because it's in my statics folder http://127.0.0.1:8000/statics/js/lib/jquery.js
[17:17:27] <rend> and there is no route for that
[17:19:52] <clondike> wait so you can't load http://127.0.0.1:8000/statics/js/lib/jquery.js in your browser?
[17:20:09] <rend> no I can't
[17:20:23] <clondike> then... how can you getScript it?
[17:21:42] <clondike> if that URL were valid then i'd expect getScript('/static/js/lib/jquery.js') to work
[17:21:50] <clondike> and if it isn't, i wouldn't

[17:30:01] <tw2113> would it not prevent the click handler from firing?
[17:30:02] <guy12> that would block the link

[17:33:18] <gabrieluk> hello folks, i've been studying js and jquery for  while and now i need to build my portfolio in order to try to get a chance in the market. I'm after ideas of real world stuff i could produce to get a "junior" position somewhere. any pro with a tip?
[17:33:27] <guy12> click the link "Clikity", the drop down appears.  It shouldn't basically
[17:34:48] <clondike> guy12: http://jsfiddle.net/Ya7np/5/
[17:35:29] <tw2113> heh, good thinkg clondike is here, i didn't even realize there was a fiddle
[17:35:34] <guy12> clondike: what if I have over 5 elements in there?
[17:36:04] <guy12> It will be quite ugly :/
[17:36:05] <clondike> my code ignores all clicks on children of #top
[17:36:10] <clondike> and only catches #top clicks
[17:36:10] <guy12> oh
[17:36:14] <guy12> I see, my bad. ty
[17:36:23] <clondike> for any number of children and grandchildren
[17:36:46] <tw2113> *goes back to setting up string translations*
[17:49:42] <rend> clondike: now I fixed my paths, I can read those js files but when I load init.js, it doesn't run https://github.com/pazooki/mindlogger/tree/master/static/js
[17:53:51] <jenia_> hello everyon
[17:53:54] <jenia_> e*
[17:54:50] <jenia_> i'm doing the following, im sending a POST message to my server. if the user is not authenticated, then i redirect him
[17:55:06] <clondike> rend: so you don't see alert('init loaded') ?
[17:55:09] <jenia_> but i need to store the original POST variables somewhere
[17:55:15] <rend> clondike: nope
[17:55:29] <jenia_> you know, the varialbes that i send like this:
[17:55:41] <clondike> how are you including that file, rend ?
[17:55:51] <jenia_> $.POST(/'save_information', post_variables)
[17:55:53] <clondike> it should just be a simple <script>
[17:56:37] <jenia_> but when i did window.localStorage.setItem('post_variables':post_variables)
[17:57:08] <jenia_> the browser ended up storing the type: "object object"
[17:57:17] <jenia_> how can i solve this problem
[17:57:35] <jenia_> how can i transfer the post_variables from one page to the other?
[17:58:01] <clondike> jenia_: with cookies (to store them in the client) or the query/GET string to add them to the URL
[17:58:40] <jenia_> with cookies? so theres no way to store an object in window.localStorage ?
[17:59:51] <clondike> you can use localStorage!
[18:00:03] <clondike> i don't mind!
[18:00:09] <jenia_> haha
[18:00:42] <jenia_>  i cant do it because instead of storing the object, the browser stores a string representing the type. like this:
[18:00:50] <jenia_> "object: object"
[18:01:05] <clondike> use JSON, jenia_
[18:01:15] <jenia_> oh yea
[18:01:19] <jenia_> haha. thanks
[18:01:21] <clondike> var json_string = JSON.stringify(obj)
[18:02:12] <jenia_> thanks very much
[18:02:45] <clondike> very welcome
[18:08:03] <werdnativ> Is it usual practice to load escaped html from a data-attribute as a template? or is there a better way?
[18:08:54] <werdnativ> Im writing a handler to add fields to a form, I've put the fields into the data-template attribute of the button that will handle the action.
[18:09:29] <werdnativ> now I obviously need to unescape the html that's in thereâ¦ so I'm wondering if I'm going about this the right way.
[18:11:24] <elb0w> In bootstrap is there a way to make an input required?
[18:12:05] <clondike> werdnativ: i would prefer to store the templates in html, within a script tag
[18:12:11] <clondike> so you don't have to escape it
[18:12:48] <clondike> <script type="text/template"> <input ... > </script>
[18:13:04] <clondike> that lets you access the HTML but it won't be executed or rendered
[18:13:07] <werdnativ> yeah, I was wondering about thatâ¦ like in a global string var? so you have to reference it somehow from the button?
[18:13:10] <clondike> that's the way most JS template engines work
[18:13:22] <clondike> lemme demo it for you
[18:14:33] <werdnativ> so if I put the button and the template as neighbours I could do $(this).next() ?
[18:14:55] <werdnativ> appreciate your help clondike, thanks.
[18:15:19] <clondike> werdnativ: http://jsfiddle.net/x3PHC/
[18:15:30] <clondike> i prefer template as child
[18:15:35] <clondike> but next() would work if you prefer
[18:15:45] <werdnativ> you rock.
[18:16:58] <clondike> werdnativ: the main advantage is no escaping and easy html editing :)
[18:17:27] <werdnativ> yeah, that's what I was thinking too.
[18:18:14] <rend> clondike: problem fixed, thanks
[18:18:41] <clondike> good work, rend! why don't you get yourself a nice present as a reward
[18:18:46] <clondike> i would
[18:19:33] <rend> clondike: :) are you kidding or are you serious?
[18:20:05] <rend> clondike: it's actually the best well structured javascript code that I have ever written and partially stolen https://github.com/pazooki/mindlogger/tree/master/static/js
[18:20:25] <clondike> i am serious
[18:20:45] <clondike> its important to reward your good work!
[18:21:00] <clondike> i like how you handled the module names
[18:21:07] <clondike> for the console

[19:18:45] <dthree> var*
[20:01:04] <bla__> hi! I'd like to know, why can't I get the actual position of an element with .offset() after I apply a css 3 translate transformation to it?
[20:01:37] <rgenito> mannn i've been working on that haha
[20:02:02] <rgenito> i've been trying to set the offset relative to the document as well....doesn't seem to be working =|
[20:02:07] <rgenito> moxx *
[20:03:10] <clondike> jQuery isn't fully 3d compliant yet
[20:03:15] <clondike> i'm sorry
[20:05:15] <moxx> hm, perhaps is not jquery's fault after all? are css3 translate transformations supposed to change top & left props of an element after they are done?
[20:09:47] <shoky> no they are not
[20:10:20] <rgenito> heya shoky :D
[20:10:27] <shoky> heys ;]
[20:10:52] <rgenito> how's it goinnn? :)

[20:12:50] <shoky> choose jquery?
[20:12:54] <faraway> rgenito: wrong framework ;)
[20:13:06] <rgenito> whattt @_@
[20:13:10] <shoky> er and jquery ui
[20:13:15] <rgenito> well what do i change? as you can see, i need a lot of help here :D
[20:13:33] <rgenito> aww crap
[20:13:35] <rgenito> how'd that happen -_-
[20:15:03] <shoky> rgenito uhh
[20:15:15] <rgenito> yay, now i just need to figure out why my "loading mask" isn't working :)
[20:15:17] <rgenito> http://jsfiddle.net/C9VFK/9/ :D ?
[20:15:20] <shoky> you're referencing 'this' in your RtsLoading  thing
[20:15:36] <rgenito> shoky i knowz
[20:15:38] <shoky> but you haven't created a new object, 'this' is just the window object
[20:16:03] <shoky> there's a syntax error
[20:16:20] <rgenito> i used var me = this; earlier so i could access it in another function... such as (inside "start()") i'd do "me.div" blah blah. but i guess i dont need it anymore :D
[20:16:28] <shoky> var me = this;
[20:16:33] <shoky> but this == window
[20:16:36] <rgenito> ooooh
[20:16:36] <shoky> so me == window as well
[20:16:46] <rgenito> well wtf.
[20:17:01] <rgenito> i see now... i thought "this" referred to the function
[20:17:02] <shoky> er
[20:17:02] <shoky> this.init = function(coverDiv, autoShow = true) {
[20:17:06] <rgenito> (the "object")
[20:17:07] <shoky> that's the syntax error :P
[20:17:19] <shoky> there are no default values for arguments in javascript ;p
[20:17:25] <rgenito> oh :'( really?
[20:17:28] <shoky> ye
[20:17:41] <rgenito> whattt
[20:17:43] <rgenito> so what should i do?
[20:17:47] <rgenito> firefox didn't complain :D
[20:17:54] <rgenito> oh wait yes it did =|
[20:18:10] <faraway> rgenito: ;) you can get the argument count
[20:18:23] <rgenito> hallllppp
[20:18:25] <rgenito> what do i do?

[20:20:04] <rgenito> faraway, in your example, when i click the "Load" button...there's the same error that RtsLoading is not defined =
[20:20:06] <rgenito> =\ *
[20:20:12] <rgenito> how do i define it on jsfiddle? i thought i already did
[20:20:35] <rgenito> Solet there's also a #css chatroom on freenode :D
[20:20:36] <faraway> rgenito: well i did not correct the rest of your cod e;) just showed you how to achive default parameters in javascript ;)
[20:21:01] <rgenito> faraway, thanks :) i appreciate that. i have now learned about 'arguments' :D
[20:21:11] <clondike> no you haven't
[20:21:25] <rgenito> yes i have >[
[20:21:34] <clondike> and that's how you do arguments!
[20:21:35] <clondike> good work
[20:21:37] <Solet> uhhh rgenito: this isnt css.... this is jq...
[20:21:38] <rgenito> LOL

[20:21:52] <rgenito> Solet ah ok mah badddz.
[20:22:36] <rgenito> shoky, so this is how "objects" are simulated in javascript? doing "var me = {}" ?
[20:22:42] <shoky> simulated?
[20:22:50] <shoky> {}  is an object
[20:22:54] <rgenito> s/simulated/word-that-you-want/
[20:22:54] <shoky> a new empty object
[20:22:57] <Solet> rgenito: $(something that gets me #foo's grand child .bar).mouseover(function() { $(this).css('background', '#5555ff') });
[20:23:03] <shoky> {} == new Object()
[20:23:31] <Solet> what's the selector for getting a grand child given a specific grand parent, tag parent and class child
[20:23:52] <pneftali> hi guys - i am cloning a set of html forms, but for the radio buttons, i want it to be a separate group, so i need to change the name attr on the cloned elements. how do I go about this ?
[20:23:52] <rgenito> Solet i tell you about #css because i've learned that i can select anything using css selectors. i dont know if it originated from javascript or what... i just know i learned a lot about all that selection stuff by learning CSS :D
[20:24:34] <rgenito> shoky so "var me = this" wouldn't be good because you'd be attaching the functions to the current window?
[20:24:44] <shoky> jQuery came about by the idea of using CSS selectors for .. selecting
[20:24:48] <rgenito> (meaning that other objects (if using the same "var me = this") would end up over-writing things as well?)
[20:24:59] <Solet> rgenito: css would select it as $(#grand parent .child)
[20:25:01] <Solet> that doesnt work
[20:25:02] <rgenito> Solet, and from what shoky just said, that is why i tell you about #css :D
[20:25:13] <Solet> ok
[20:25:28] <Solet> cool... tried it. doesnt work. thats why i came here with the question
[20:26:01] <rgenito> (and i dont know how to select a grand child :D ... googling "css grandchild selector" or something around those lines should help)
[20:26:31] <rgenito> shoky, your example finally helps (along with faraway's input as well) ... thx a lot :)
[20:26:35] <clondike> also googling for "children smoking"
[20:26:41] <clondike> that is very soothing
[20:27:03] <rgenito> shoky btw, wouldn't it be ok to just do, "if (autoShow) {" since the undefined object is considered false anyways?
[20:28:59] <shoky> rgenito: but you wanted the default to be true
[20:29:11] <rgenito> ooooooh
[20:29:11] <shoky> rgenito: and if no argument is passed , it'll be === undefined
[20:29:18] <faraway> Solet: $("#parent > * > grandChild")   ? thought  $("#parent >  > grandChild") should also work but not sure right now if this was a but or is intended to work
[20:29:21] <rgenito> true
[20:29:34] <shoky> there's proll a nicer way to write it, i just wanted to get it working
[20:30:33] <faraway> shoky: but if i pass undefined :P ?
[20:30:47] <shoky> yep ;p
[20:33:18] <shoky> oh , just noticed that you showed that nicer way
[20:34:22] <Solet> ok... its $(parent grandchild).blahdostuffs
[20:34:32] <Solet> it also helps when you dont have quote mismatches
[20:38:51] <shoky> parent & grandchild?  that's a 3 generation leap :P
[20:39:46] <Foxhoundz> Does jQuery support the onHashChange event?
[20:40:00] <shoky> Foxhoundz: yez
[20:40:07] <Foxhoundz> ..really?
[20:40:15] <shoky> it supports any ol' event
[20:40:28] <Foxhoundz> i can't find it in the documentation

[20:40:49] <shoky> $(window).on('hashchange', function(e) { ... })

[20:41:06] <bbt> is it possible to hard link the tabs in http://jqueryui.com/tabs/ ? im using accordion too and its messing it up as the #tabs-1 ends up in the accordion submenu url?
[20:41:32] <rgenito> awww crap

[20:50:48] <rgenito> hmmm
[20:51:11] <rgenito> any reason why calling offset() on a selected div gives me {top: 1290, left: 0} ?
[20:51:19] <rgenito> ...the div is closer to the middle-right of the screen...
[20:53:10] <faraway> rgenito: i would guess you have the wrong div
[20:53:17] <rgenito> damn >[
[20:53:31] <rgenito> yaaa probably
[20:53:45] <rgenito> or maybe i need to just wait until the document is ready...
[20:56:52] <shoky> ya it's either wrong div or wrong time ;P
[20:58:29] <rgenito> welp, the document was ready
[21:00:29] <shoky> could also be that the offset is correct, but you just think its wrong cause not the whole width of the div is visible
[21:01:34] <rgenito> shoky oh great point
[21:05:23] <bbt> shoky http://jsfiddle.net/xbVKu/
[21:07:26] <rgenito> man, so close to givin uppz ;(
[21:09:04] <rgenito> ok i see why i'm having problems :)
[21:09:13] <rgenito> and it's all shoky's fault
[21:11:33] <iliketurtles> i am inserting an <li> element via a .bind("ajaxSuccess") call.  i also want to be able to DELETE this <li> element., and remove it via a .bind("ajaxSuccess") call, but the .bind() isn't being run on this <li> i've injected with jquery -- how to resolve?
[21:11:59] <iliketurtles> i figure it isn't being called because the .bind() is run in document.ready, BEFORE this new <li> is injected into the DOM
[21:12:12] <clondike> ?on @ iliketurtles
[21:12:13] <bot-t> iliketurtles, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[21:12:25] <iliketurtles> ah blast.  i should've known that
[21:12:25] <clondike> you're interested in the live binding part
[21:13:32] <iliketurtles> clondike: am i using .on() to bind to ajaxSuccess, or the click on the delete button for the <li>?
[21:14:33] <clondike> the click part, iliketurtles
[21:14:36] <iliketurtles> from the docs, seems I shouldn't use .bind() at all in 1.7
[21:14:42] <rgenito> oooh ok i see the problem... i think
[21:15:11] <rgenito> $('#myDiv').offset({top: 100, left: 100}); ... just to make sure i'm not crazy, that will set the position of the div, right?
[21:15:23] <rgenito> (div is position: absolute and z-index: 1)
[21:15:50] <faraway> rgenito: yes
[21:15:51] <clondike> iliketurtles: you shouldn't use it if you want your code to work with jQuery 2.0, whenever that happens
[21:15:57] <iliketurtles> rgr
[21:16:01] <clondike> but it's not the end of the world
[21:16:29] <clondike> the mayan apocalypse is the end of the world
[21:16:37] <shoky> bbt: huh?
[21:16:39] <clondike> bind() is not the mayan apocalypse
[21:16:39] <iliketurtles> seems like my only solution for what I want, otherwise i will have to re-bind() once I add the injected element
[21:16:47] <clondike> right
[21:16:50] <iliketurtles> blasted
[21:16:58] <iliketurtles> i will change to .on() and not make this mistake again =]
[21:17:01] <iliketurtles> thanks for your help
[21:17:12] <bbt> shoky re: is it possible to hard link the tabs in http://jqueryui.com/tabs/ ? im using accordion too and its messing it up as the #tabs-1 ends up in the accordion submenu url?
[21:17:13] <rgenito> faraway, if you have a second, could you look at the console log here?
[21:17:14] <rgenito> http://www.rtsvc.com/rns/rental/GC202/
[21:17:44] <rgenito> i basically spell out how i'm calculating the coords...but as you can see (from console message), i'm not getting the proper values =[
[21:19:12] <shoky> bbt: yes.. but that fiddle is very incomplete and not working at all, and wtf is dcAccordion, and we need to SEE the problem in order to help you. "its messing up" doesnt help much
[21:20:16] <shoky> and you also have some php in there or something, awesome
[21:22:47] <tw2113> <script src="jquery.shokymindreading.min.js"></script>
[21:22:52] <tw2113> forgot to include that shoky
[21:22:55] <faraway> rgenito: make the div you want to get the offset form visible
[21:23:19] <bbt> shoky updated, its the jquery tabs can i change the hastags to hard linked urls?
[21:23:20] <faraway> rgenito: while it has display: none, you won't get the correct offset
[21:23:31] <rgenito> oooooh
[21:24:22] <rgenito> ahh whoops... my "divToCover" is also the loadingMask...hehe
[21:26:21] <shoky> bbt: you have to link us to the updated fiddle.  what does hard linked urls mean?
[21:26:25] <mehwork> jquery 1.8.1 doesn't support ie8 does it?
[21:26:45] <shoky> mehwork: it does
[21:27:04] <shoky> mehwork: but.. as long as you/re in 1.8, use 1.8.2
[21:27:12] <mehwork> shoky: it's giving me all kinds of errors like 'object doesnt support property or methd 'concat'
[21:27:28] <shoky> mehwork: sounds fun
[21:27:48] <mehwork> very
[21:28:06] <shoky> if you want help you'll need to give more details
[21:28:15] <shoky> as in a jsfiddle
[21:28:26] <shoky> reproducing the prob. preferably with 1.8.2
[21:28:51] <mehwork> shoky the prob seems to be a lack of support for the .animate property all together
[21:28:59] <shoky> i doubt that
[21:29:06] <mehwork> this particular error is happening with jquery's createTweens() method
[21:29:09] <mehwork> internal method
[21:29:16] <rgenito> i see now... so in order to properly place this loading mask... i need to set the loadingMask.offset() after calling loadingMask.show()?
[21:29:43] <bbt> nm, gotta go
[21:30:49] <rgenito> any other ideas for this loading mask?
[21:31:30] <rgenito> on http://www.rtsvc.com/rns/rental/GC202/ ... you can call RtsLoading.start() on the console, and a black bar should go over the #reservationInput (which is the form to the right of the datepicker at the bottom)
[21:31:32] <faraway> rgenito: not sure if it needs to be visible for set. but why don't you just test it yourselfe
[21:31:35] <rgenito> any help would be super helpful :(
[21:31:53] <rgenito> faraway, turns out it doesn't need to be visible to be set. but it does need to be visible to retrieve the offset() values
[21:31:59] <iliketurtles> clondike: weird, switched over to using .on() and my delete button injected into the DOM still isn't triggering the .on("ajaxSucess") callback
[21:33:07] <iliketurtles> https://gist.github.com/3856616 -- anyone got any idea why my .on("ajaxSuccess") wouldn't be called in the delete comment section here?
[21:33:34] <rgenito> faraway, homie i need yew :D
[21:34:40] <faraway> rgenito: i wouldn't trust me :P
[21:34:49] <rgenito> ;(
[21:35:18] <faraway> rgenito: not at that time of the day :D
[21:37:03] <rgenito> ok now i will be very happy if someone can point me to a jquery function that will give me the width/height of the div ;)
[21:37:06] <rgenito> or the class whicheva
[21:37:30] <prishabh> I can point you to the jquery documentation
[21:37:50] <rgenito> YESSS
[21:37:53] <faraway> rgenito: well on start you show the loadingMask, but you should call the init with the div to cover right before
[21:38:12] <rgenito> "you should call the init with the div to cover right before", huh?
[21:38:27] <rgenito> i almost got ya...just need more nouns/adjectives
[21:38:30] <faraway> rgenito: RtsLoading.init where you define the offset
[21:40:33] <faraway> rgenito: if you do RtsLoading.init("reservationInput");  RtsLoading.start(); in the console  it is placed correctly ? (except that it has the wrong height)
[21:40:58] <rgenito> ah i see... it's actually ".inputs" that i need the position of.... not #reservationInput
[21:43:19] <rgenito> faraway, ty for checking this out with me
[21:43:29] <faraway> rgenito:  6:42 am here ... and i really need some coffee ... so i'm out now :P
[21:43:34] <rgenito> RtsLoading.start() wasn't placing correctly... then i realized it was cause of the class
[21:43:40] <rgenito> faraway i buy you coffee man :D
[21:43:43] <rgenito> but have a good night :)
[21:43:46] <rgenito> thanks again! :D
[21:43:52] <shoky> oo same time here
[21:44:01] <rgenito> where are you? UK?
[21:44:01] <faraway> shoky: ^^
[21:44:19] <shoky> < israel
[21:44:23] <faraway> shoky: so what the hell are you doing here :P
[21:44:28] <azbyin> hi all..
[21:44:46] <rgenito> oh cool :)
[21:44:46] <faraway> swiss
[21:44:48] <azbyin> i want to make a cross domain ajax request. and I have enabled CORS on my other server..
[21:44:48] <shoky> faraway: i have my own hours ;>
[21:45:00] <shoky> night person
[21:45:05] <azbyin> the problem now is that jquery doesn;t even send the query to my server!
[21:45:23] <shoky> that is, i havent slept yet
[21:45:55] <rgenito> awww man wtf
[21:45:59] <faraway> shoky: hehe ... well .. same here ... but in 3 hours the work day begins :/ damn projects ^^
[21:46:13] <prishabh> quit the work
[21:46:15] <azbyin> actually wait.. i'm getting a 401 unauthorised response
[21:46:17] <shoky> ;]
[21:46:28] <azbyin> how do i auth with an ajax request?
[21:47:12] <azbyin> because if i load the same url as the ajax request directly in the browser location bar, it pops up a username/password dialog and if i enter the right credentials, it shows the resulting response
[21:47:22] <jikatouch> hey i'm developing a library that currently operates as a jquery plugin. how important is it to eliminate the dependency on jquery in a library?
[21:47:52] <shoky> jikatouch: how important..? that's up to you no?
[21:47:56] <faraway> prishabh:  < ?
[21:48:13] <shoky> some people like jquery as a dependency and that may be important to them..
[21:48:23] <jikatouch> i love jquery and wouldn't ever use the vanilla dom if i had a choice, but i'm concerned users would be turned off by the dependency
[21:48:52] <prishabh> how will users know you are using jquery ?
[21:49:31] <shoky> jikatouch: like i said, up to you, depends how concerned you are about that, who your target users are, etc..
[21:51:01] <Milos> I need to select all div.choice-selected elements AFTER a div with ID x.
[21:51:27] <shoky> after meaning siblings that are after?
[21:51:28] <Milos> I'm looking at prev+next
[21:51:43] <Milos> They need to be systematically after.
[21:51:47] <Milos> In the code.
[21:51:54] <Milos> NOT necessarily children.
[21:52:01] <Milos> But after.
[21:52:08] <jikatouch> shoky: what about just minifying my library with jquery? is that forbidden?
[21:52:12] <Milos> And they are not directly beside.
[21:52:19] <shoky> jikatouch: wat?
[21:52:45] <tw2113> 1 file, 2 different script parts in it
[21:52:49] <tw2113> jquery at the top
[21:52:55] <tw2113> some plugin reliant on it at the bottom
[21:53:57] <shoky> me no like dat
[21:54:32] <rgenito> is there a way to grab css values with jquery?
[21:54:41] <shoky> if its dependent on jquery i want to know it and include jquery myself (or have my dependency manager include it)
[21:55:01] <shoky> rgenito: .css(...)
[21:55:10] <jikatouch> shoky: fair enough
[21:55:33] <bluesm> hi
[21:55:41] <rgenito> shoky no i mean... for example... is there a way i can set var coordX = padding-top of #reservationInput
[21:55:42] <rgenito> ?
[21:55:54] <rgenito> i guess i didn't try $('#reservationInput').css('padding-top') :)
[21:56:00] <shoky> ...
[21:56:05] <bluesm> What is the difference between "$('#area').append($('<div>').addClass('someClass'));âââââââ"
[21:56:14] <bluesm> and "$('#area').append($('<div/>').addClass('someClass'));"âââââââ
[21:56:18] <rgenito> WHOA @_@
[21:56:18] <shoky> rgenito: i hope the dots speak for themselves
[21:56:22] <bluesm> One slash.
[21:56:44] <rgenito> shoky yes, you didn't even need the dots, hence the statement i made before them ;)
[21:56:57] <rgenito> i love the philosophy of how jquery works with setters/getters
[21:57:18] <rgenito> always annoyed me how class "getters" had a programming design patter of naming a function, "getValue()" ... >[
[21:57:19] <shoky> bluesm: there's no difference
[21:57:41] <rgenito> shoky now the tough question is how to add that value to an integer :)
[21:57:45] <bluesm> shoky:  So why somebody use <div/>
[21:57:46] <bluesm> ?
[21:57:56] <shoky> rgenito:  parseInt
[21:58:00] <rgenito> WTF!
[21:58:09] <rgenito> awesome!!! i'm so happy parseInt ignores the text :D
[21:58:19] <rgenito> WAIT A MINUTE... that best work in IE7 also ;)
[21:58:33] <shoky> bluesm:  because that explicitly says the div is closed.. but it doesn't matter
[21:58:55] <shoky> bluesm: it might matter in real HTML if you're using a weird browser
[21:59:09] <shoky> or some weird mode or i dunno
[21:59:22] * rgenito loving javascript right about now
[22:00:28] <bubbles10101> How does one just return the *immediate* element which contains a piece of text? $('*:contains(Hello)') returns a whole array of elements even though the actual string 'Hello' is only contained in the last <p> element
[22:01:15] <bubbles10101> $('*:contains(Hello)') returns the body and a whole bunch of elements that only indirectly contain string being searched for
[22:01:26] <rgenito> ...i guess this would only really work if the padding/margin value was specified in "px" :)
[22:01:58] <bluesm>  shoky: Ok thanks :)
[22:04:16] <Milos> Is it possible to select all elements NOT consecutively after element X and NOT on the same HTML heirarchy level as element X but still systematically AFTER element X?
[22:04:28] <Milos> And by all elements I mean all elements with a certain class.
[22:04:33] <Milos> So not all elements.
[22:04:48] <clondike> Milos: i would use ?filter
[22:04:49] <bot-t> Milos, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[22:04:54] <Milos> Thank you.
[22:05:05] <clondike> for that kind of complexity it should be cleaner than a crazy selector
[22:05:10] <Milos> I think so too.
[22:06:28] <azbyin> can someone help me out with my ajax request with auth?
[22:06:57] <Milos> clondike, I have an idea though.
[22:07:02] <azbyin> i am setting up the right headers, and in the apache logs, i get a 200ok, but within the browser in the firebug console i get statusText="error"
[22:07:24] <Lee-Lee> hi guys, I've got this code to make an element scroll with the page: http://paste.roguecoders.com/p/051e47b83d5d27b9a085f6cc3e0ebedc.txt but it seems to be very jerky.. any ideas why?
[22:07:30] <Milos> clondike, I could select all elements with that class I was talking about, but ignore the first x results. To do this however I need to find out what that x number is. Do you know how I can find out what number an element is, out of all of their kind?
[22:07:37] <clondike> did you try googling for it, azbyin? i haven't worked with ajax auth before so i'd have to look it up
[22:07:51] <clondike> ?index @ Milos
[22:07:51] <bot-t> Milos, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[22:07:56] <azbyin> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5507234/how-to-use-basic-auth-and-jquery-and-ajax
[22:07:59] <bluesm> shoky: But this mean that it is "self closed"
[22:08:00] <clondike> ignore that description, it can do what you want
[22:08:06] <Milos> That could be what I want then.
[22:08:10] <azbyin> and the answer is the right one
[22:08:10] <Milos> Thank you clondike.
[22:08:15] <bluesm> shoky: Without content inside (only properties) yes ?
[22:08:34] <azbyin> but i'm simply seeing statusText "error" on my client side
[22:09:01] <clondike> azbyin: did you try the beforeSend() fix?
[22:09:12] <azbyin> that is what i am using!
[22:09:19] <clondike> ah
[22:10:24] <initself> does  $('prod_num.${num}').removeClass(); match id="prod_num.0"  ?
[22:10:45] <clondike> azbyin: what about that later answer that suggests you can provide username and password directly to ajax() ?
[22:10:50] <prishabh> ${num} is that some new way of string interpolation in jquery ?
[22:10:56] <bluesm> I mean $('<div/>')   -- mean self closed? Right ?
[22:10:59] <shoky> bubbles10101: just using .last() doesn't work for you?
[22:11:11] <bubbles10101> shoky: mmm let me try that
[22:11:28] <clondike> not that i know of, prishabh
[22:11:33] <azbyin> $.ajax({ url: myurl, dataType: "text", data: "blah=foo&dodo=bar", beforeSend: function(xhr) { xhr.setRequestHeader("Authorization", make_base_auth(uname, pwd)); }, success: function(response){console.log(response);} ));
[22:11:54] <mehwork> if an error in the browser's console only says something about happening inside of jquery 1.8.2, line 8595, but nothing about any source files i wrote, how the heck am i supposed to debug that exactly?
[22:12:14] <azbyin> clondike, i don;t know what version of jquery actually works with username: and password: direct options
[22:12:24] <clondike> azbyin: i would try the username: and password: arguments supported by 1.7
[22:12:30] <azbyin> i tried in 1.8.0 and it simply does not even make the ajax call!
[22:12:40] <clondike> that's not right >: |
[22:14:04] <azbyin> clondike, wait a minute..
[22:14:13] <azbyin> i see only an OPTIONS request on the server log!
[22:14:29] <bubbles10101> shoky: thanks yeah that worked! :)
[22:14:38] <clondike> interesting, azbyin
[22:14:42] <azbyin> i.e. the client asked if it was ok to make the cross domain request and that came back with 200 ok
[22:14:56] <azbyin> but the actual GET call to get the data never went!
[22:14:59] <azbyin> what the!
[22:14:59] <bubbles10101> ps does it not seem like odd behavior that $('*:contains(Hello)') returns elements that don't actually contain the string 'Hello'?
[22:15:17] <clondike> it's a brave new world
[22:15:49] <clondike> bubbles10101: you mean how it returns elements that contain elements that contain 'Hello'?
[22:15:58] <clondike> body and html and such?
[22:16:10] <bubbles10101> clondike: yeah exactly!
[22:16:29] <shoky> it's not really a selector that's meant to be used like that
[22:16:44] <bubbles10101> clondike: since i want to loop through all the returned elements and delete any element that has the word 'Hello' in it, purging the page of 'Hello's :)
[22:16:49] <clondike> it's more sensible for like a:contains(google)
[22:17:07] <shoky> it's meant more for filtering a list of specified elements. like 10 child divs of some common parent, filter out the ones that contain 'Shit'
[22:17:17] <azbyin> so this is completely weird..
[22:17:39] <bubbles10101> clondike: however, $('*:contains(Hello)').detach() will kill the whole document if Hello appears in any element :(
[22:17:53] <azbyin> i only get an options request.. and if i repeat the call without the auth after a small timeout *removing the auth stuff*, now i get 401
[22:18:02] <clondike> you should use jQuery's strengths rather than it's weaknesses :)
[22:18:14] <azbyin> so i can auth, but when i do that i cannot GET, or I can GET, but when I do that, I cannot auth
[22:18:15] <prishabh> what a protip
[22:18:15] <azbyin> lol
[22:18:47] <clondike> bubbles10101: a nice fix would be to add a :strict-contains() pseudoselector that does just what you want
[22:18:56] <clondike> it's an interesting exercise, you'd probably enjoy it
[22:19:25] <bubbles10101> clondike: haha um yeah.. ;)
[22:19:37] <clondike> azbyin: thank you for reminding me never to do auth AJAX :(
[22:20:08] <bubbles10101> so any idea how you guys would go about doing that maybe using another method? (basically delete all immediate elements that contain the string 'Hello')
[22:20:11] <azbyin> clondike, although remember that this is cross domain
[22:20:19] <azbyin> maybe thats why its getting messed up?
[22:20:35] <clondike> OMG
[22:20:40] <clondike> of course!
[22:20:41] <azbyin> i see a crossDomain property that can be passed to $.ajax(  i'll ry that
[22:20:58] <clondike> i don't think this will ever work, azbyin
[22:20:59] <azbyin> clondike, err.. i've already enabled CORS on my secondary server
[22:21:07] <clondike> yes but...
[22:21:12] <clondike> this is CORS on steroids
[22:21:23] <azbyin> why?
[22:21:28] <clondike> the thought of it is liquifying my bowels
[22:21:33] <azbyin> its just regular CORS with auth mixed in :)
[22:21:48] <clondike> regular cors is like regular cors, and the auth is like the steroids
[22:21:57] <clondike> ALL I AM SAYING is be prepared to give up
[22:22:18] <bubbles10101> maybe a combination of contains and filter?
[22:22:19] <azbyin> i'm almost there, heh
[22:22:33] <azbyin> as in the state you mention of
[22:22:53] <bubbles10101> or put another way.. is there someway to differentiate between elements that produce screen text output, vs those that don't?
[22:24:02] <rgenito> hmmm
[22:24:16] <rgenito> are there other ways to center an image in a div? rather than margin-left: auth, margin-right: auto, etc?
[22:24:33] <clondike> the deprecated <center> tag, rgenito
[22:24:43] <rgenito> clondike, lol
[22:24:55] <rgenito> i guess it works... but that wouldn't give me vertical alignment
[22:25:04] <rgenito> i guess i'm just gunna break down and use a f'n table

[22:25:37] <tw2113> some lols from twitter: "Columbus is the second-most hated explorer in the world, second only to Internet Explorer."
[22:25:58] <sriyani> rgenito is image inside <a> tag?
[22:26:27] <clondike> rgenito: vertical-align: middle ?
[22:26:28] <iliketurtles> can anyone points me in the direction of a good explanation of how to use jquery .on() method in conjunction with ajaxSuccess callback?  I am extremely stumped, and the docs don't give an example: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[22:26:44] <rgenito> no, image is only inside <div>
[22:27:12] <rgenito> sriyani, <div id="loadingMask"><img src="blah" /></div>
[22:27:53] <sriyani> rgenito, wait
[22:30:32] <clondike> iliketurtles: i'm a bit busy with actual work work but if you can do a live demo or link to your implementation that will make it easier for someone to help debug
[22:31:02] <iliketurtles> clondike: thanks mate, will try and put a jsfiddle together as a gist is only so helpful
[22:31:33] <clondike> good luck babe
[22:36:14] <shoky> bubbles10101 this is what i came up with heh. theres prolly a much simpler way to do it  $('*').filter( function() { return $(this).contents().filter(function() { return this.nodeType == 3 && (this.textContent || this.innerText).match(/Hello/) }).length } )
[22:36:16] <shoky> oops
[22:36:28] <shoky> i meant to paste a link, not code:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/pf3eN/
[22:37:02] <bubbles10101> shoky: oooh.. /looks
[22:38:15] <werdnativ> What's the jQuery way to check if a selector finds something: do you just check $('.something').length > 0 ?
[22:38:36] <shoky> werdnativ: yep
[22:38:59] <werdnativ> cool, thanks. it's been forever since I wrote any jQuery. ;)
[22:39:04] <bubbles10101> shoky: great stuff.. yeah that works perfectly! :) tnx... basically hasHello.detach() and boom no more pesky Hello's :p
[22:39:39] <sriyani> rgenito, http://pastebin.com/gwXW6qHk
[22:40:01] <shoky> bubbles10101: heh cool. use at your own risk ;P it's bound to fail horribly for some scenarios
[22:40:07] <bubbles10101> shoky: out of interest.. what does nodeType == 3 do?
[22:40:21] <shoky> bubbles10101:  3 means it's a text node
[22:40:26] <sriyani> rgenito, line height is div height+half of image height
[22:41:00] <sriyani> if img is inside <a> a{line-height:500px;}
[22:41:25] <rgenito> interesting
[22:41:38] <rgenito> my image isn't centering at all... so let me try these things
[22:41:53] <bubbles10101> shoky: cool.. btw would hasHello.detach() create multiple reflows? or just one?
[22:42:07] <sriyani> rgenito,  <!DOCTYPE HTML> is required
[22:42:47] <cocomo> hi, does jquery have a function to convert URLs in a string to links?
[22:42:56] <shoky> bubbles10101: multiple i believe. if you mean when hasHello is more than 1 element
[22:43:26] <rgenito> sriyani, oooooh
[22:43:29] <rgenito> let me try that
[22:44:02] <rgenito> <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
[22:44:05] <rgenito> sriyani, how about that? :D
[22:44:08] <bubbles10101> hmm yeah.. that's what i thought... i know multiple additions can be chained together to batch 1 reflow... i suspect the same does not apply to deletions though...?
[22:44:26] <rgenito> sriyani, is that acceptable? :D or too strict? hehe
[22:44:56] <sriyani> rgenito, its ok
[22:45:39] <buu> Hey, can anyone give me a hint as to why this jqplot code: http://nopaste.dk/p14592 is producing a line graph and not a barChart ?
[22:46:14] <shoky> bubbles10101: dont really know
[22:46:46] <rgenito> sriyani, ty for the info, i'll have to try this another time
[22:46:48] <rgenito> time for beddd :D
[22:46:54] <rgenito> gnighty everyone! and thanks all for the help
[22:47:02] <shoky> g'nite
[22:47:46] <rgenito> :D
[22:53:26] <mdedetrich> is it just me, or has has the hide function broken when using the slide effect?
[22:54:54] <initself> \quit
[22:55:26] <mdedetrich> doing something like $(this).hide("slide", { direction: "down" }, 1000); no longer works
[22:59:05] <funka> isn't the first param of hide() supposed to be speed, not effect?
[22:59:18] <funka> like, hide("slow, â¦)
[22:59:29] <funka> otheriwse you would use slideUp() or slideDown() ??
[22:59:53] <yoohahn> yes first param is duration
[23:00:33] <yoohahn> and you should take ms in it aswell
[23:01:16] <yoohahn> I think fast and slow will work and be used as ms, not sure about the time then thou
[23:03:35] <mdedetrich> funka: well then the documentation hasn't changed
[23:03:44] <mdedetrich> funka: and neither has there been any mention of this
[23:03:58] <mdedetrich> my code literally broke to Jquery's 1.8 update
[23:04:11] <buu> Is there a good place I could ask jqplot questins?
[23:04:18] <buu> Or questions, I have some of those also
[23:04:34] <mdedetrich> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Slide
[23:08:32] <mdedetrich> oh well, reverting back to jquery 1.7.2
[23:09:15] <funka> yes, back to 1.7.2 and then put together an isolated jsfiddle showing the breakage to 1.8
[23:09:30] <mdedetrich> I just posted
[23:09:31] <mdedetrich> the breaked
[23:09:40] <mdedetrich> funka: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Slide
[23:09:42] <mdedetrich> that doesn't work
[23:10:53] <funka> are you also updating your jquery UI libraries as well?
[23:11:20] <funka> i see now that syntax is specific to jquery UI, not part of native/core jquery
[23:11:50] <mdedetrich> ok
[23:11:53] <mdedetrich> that would explain it
[23:12:01] <mdedetrich> I got a stripped version of jquery-ui
[23:14:41] <funka> well maybe instead of also updating UI, which probably isn't bad idea, you could try what i mentioned, using "slideUp/slideDown" methods in its place?
[23:14:55] <funka> like, if you really need to upgrade it
[23:15:08] <mdedetrich> funka: I need to slide to the left
[23:15:11] <mdedetrich> not up or down
[23:16:11] <funka> look to animate() functoin then?
[23:16:44] <funka> â¦or see how big a hassle just updating UI is1
[23:16:48] <funka> **is!
[23:17:40] <mdedetrich> the bigger problem is updating all the code funka, jquery ui isn't a hassle compared to that
[23:18:43] <funka> best of luck to you!
[23:25:10] <mdedetrich> funka: yeah that was it
[23:25:14] <mdedetrich> funka: thanks, it works now
[23:26:28] <rsumi> does query have a built in affect much like slideDown but an effect that the widget actually looks like it's sliding out and not rolling down?
[23:27:06] <funka> I can see where the confusion would come from, with the overloading of core hide() method by a plugin
[23:27:25] <funka> albeit an officially-sanctioned plugin
[23:27:30] <mdedetrich> funka: indeed
[23:27:46] <mdedetrich> funka: just had to add the slide effect in my jquery-ui download
[23:27:49] <funka> glad you got it resolved!
[23:29:54] <mdedetrich> also while you are here
[23:30:07] <mdedetrich> is it just me, or does firefox on mac have terrible fluidity in ui animations like fade
[23:30:14] <mdedetrich> when using jquery
[23:30:47] <mdedetrich> animations in chrome look so much smoother
[23:35:12] <funka> yes that is my impression sometimes too
[23:35:21] <funka> not all the time, but noticeably sometimes for sure
[23:37:34] <funka> difference can sometimes be very notcieable if using a "CSS transform" versus something that has to shrink or fade something frame by frame
[23:37:54] <funka> so add Mobile Safari (and papa safari) to you list of browsers that will animate smoothlier
[23:37:59] <funka> "smoothlier" yes.
[23:38:01] <tw2113> sadly, browsers aren't the exact same even at the DOM level
[23:56:12] <lucasw> Hi, i have a bit of a problem here. My website complains about: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined in the file named... wait for it... jquery.js which is hosted at code.jquery.com. Why? :F
