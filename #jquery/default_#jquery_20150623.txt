[00:14:27] <SteenJobs> if i have three nested divs, and i want to get the position of number 3 with respect to number 2, is that possible? .position() gives me 3 with respect to 1…
[00:15:13] <Cork> SteenJobs: div3.offset().top - div2.offset().top
[00:15:36] <Cork> or if div 3 is inside div 2 you could just set div2 as overflow: hodden
[00:15:39] <Cork> * hidden
[00:16:03] <SteenJobs> Cork: but when i recreate my image ‘collage’ on a different page, if the enclosing div/canvas is not in the exact same location as the original, the first method won’t work...
[00:16:20] <SteenJobs> Cork: basically i have a canvas where users can drag and drop images of clothing to create outfits.
[00:17:12] <SteenJobs> Cork: and i want to save the outfit on their profile page, having a much smaller non-draggable/droppable canvas that displays their outfit, but i need the images to be in the same position with respect to the new enclosing div that they had with respect to the original enclosing div.
[00:19:04] <SteenJobs> Cork: or am i totally wrong about that…
[00:19:20] <SteenJobs> yea you’re right
[00:19:36] <SteenJobs> Cork: i can just then replace div3 with new_div and do the same thing on the newly rendered canvas
[00:23:02] <arc_> ya
[00:23:13] <SteenJobs> ha thanks bud
[00:23:31] <Cork> oh, sorry i missed the question in there
[00:24:14] <SteenJobs> how dare you
[00:24:51] <Cork> don't forget the question mark next time ;P
[00:25:49] <SteenJobs> haha mah b
[00:29:46] <jquery292> This sets the box to checked when you click on the right box, but when I click on another box and go back to the default it doesnt check the checkbox.. why? http://paste.ee/p/H2VZe
[00:29:54] <jquery292> Doing and on('click',function()...
[00:36:06] <al-damiri> Hi #jquery.
[00:36:35] <al-damiri> Is a 2-3 minute timeout in $.ajax call okay (while we show to the user a progress loader)?
[00:36:44] <al-damiri> Will I have any issues with browsers/web-servers?
[00:36:55] <al-damiri> What other things I need to have in consideration?
[00:43:38] <Cork> al-damiri: you mean the server takes 2-3 minutes to process the request?
[01:04:04] <torbjorn> is it possible to create custom pseudo classes?
[01:04:35] <torbjorn> in my case i have foldable sections on a page, and if a section contains a clicked button (that may not show if the section is folded up), i want the color of the section head to change
[01:04:48] <torbjorn> so something like ":has-clicked-buttons"
[01:04:54] <Cork> yes, you can
[01:05:10] <torbjorn> .. and then use that in css
[01:05:30] <Cork> no you cna't
[01:05:34] <Cork> *can't
[01:05:38] <Cork> it would only work in jquery
[01:06:06] <torbjorn> i see, ill just toggle classes on events then
[01:06:19] <Cork> that is normally the better idea
[01:06:31] <Cork> anyway about the selectors: http://jquery-howto.blogspot.se/2009/06/custom-jquery-selectors.html
[01:06:32] <torbjorn> just trying to do away with the plumbing
[01:06:53] <torbjorn> thanks
[01:07:16] <torbjorn> ah yes im already doing that with a case insensitive :icontains (that i picked up from stackexchange)
[01:07:29] <torbjorn> no stackoverflow
[01:07:39] <Cork> hmm
[01:07:48] <Cork> you should prob do away with that too
[01:07:52] <torbjorn> i see
[01:08:06] <Cork> needing to use :contains in selectors normally means you have structured your html wrong
[01:08:16] <torbjorn> i agree
[01:08:50] <torbjorn> that being said i also see im actually not using it anymore
[01:08:59] <torbjorn> so ahead of myself aparently
[01:09:05] <torbjorn> but thanks for the input
[01:09:06] <Cork> :)
[01:19:05] <SteenJobs> Cork: any chance you know rails too?
[01:19:31] <Cork> SteenJobs: i do, but => #rubyonrails
[01:19:39] <SteenJobs> Cork: oh please, i live there :)
[01:19:59] <SteenJobs> Cork: but i’d say this question is equally jquery related, and i know the rails part better than the jquery part ha
[01:33:54] <andywww> I am using handlebars to generate a set of link elements. I’d like to loop through and modify the src attribute of an anchor element immediately after I’ve built and rendered the handlebars template to the screen but normal selectors don’t seem to be picking it up
[01:34:23] <Cork> andywww: you mean don't pick them up when you run them again?
[01:34:37] <Cork> selectors only find what exist when they run
[01:34:44] <Cork> they don't see future elements
[01:34:53] <andywww> is this a common problem? the only info i can find is how to fix a click but I don’t want it to handle the click
[01:34:53] <andywww> one sec
[01:36:49] <andywww> Yep thats what I’m thinking
[01:37:09] <andywww> but i’m not sure how to delegate as its not a click event
[01:37:09] <andywww> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/30ae0a2420b6c816aec3
[01:37:35] <andywww> i almost need to run “and then read the dom again” after handlbars has populated it
[01:38:19] <Cork> andywww: you would have to run 11-13 again after the template has updated the page
[01:38:40] <Cork> andywww: or even better, run it on the generated dom before you append it to the page
[01:39:20] <andywww> hmm, is there a callback on handlebars for that sort of thing?
[01:39:24] <andywww> I’ll have a look
[01:39:24] <andywww> thanks
[01:39:28] <Cork> no
[01:39:37] <Cork> there isn't a need for it
[01:39:50] <Cork> when you give the template to the engine it returns the html
[01:40:23] <andywww> would line 3 not see the page updated though?
[01:40:41] <Cork> just do var newContent = $($.parseHTML()) newContent.find('selector').each()... $('target').html(newContent);
[01:41:07] <Cork> if the code looks exactly like that
[01:41:18] <Cork> tghen yes line 11 should see the new html from line 3
[01:41:24] <Cork> then*
[01:41:46] <Cork> but if line 3 runs again without line 11 the old line 11 won't catch it
[01:42:21] <andywww> cool beans
[01:42:24] <andywww> thanks!
[01:46:43] <silverdust> Hi! I don't want to set unique ids as any other person should just add images in future with data-img. How do I make the images here unique based on their own data-img http://jsfiddle.net/fvew1dph/
[01:47:49] <arc_> unique how
[01:48:14] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/fvew1dph/2/
[01:48:19] <Cork> silverdust: ^
[01:48:21] <silverdust> I updated it here http://jsfiddle.net/fvew1dph/1/ . The last data-img is to show a Chuck Norris picture but it still shows
[01:48:59] <arc_> i see
[01:49:07] <arc_> well Cork seems to have solved that :p
[01:49:29] <silverdust> Thank you. Just what I wanted
[01:53:06] <Renkineko> hi everyone o/
[01:54:46] <Renkineko> some question about tabs : I have a tab but I would like to append to the title a canvas with a spinner using throbber.js ( http://aino.github.io/throbber.js/ ), but the style is not matching : the canvas go to a new line (my tabs are inline, not on the side)... Any idea how to do it properly ?
[01:55:37] <Cork> Renkineko: make sure the <canvas> has display: inline-block;
[01:55:51] <Renkineko> ooooooh it's probably this !
[01:56:06] <Renkineko> I'll try it right now =]
[01:56:31] <Renkineko> yup, it was that ! :) thank you so much
[02:00:44] <Cthulhux> hi :-) i have a problem: i query dynamically generated HTML data supplied via smarty (yes, i also asked this in #smarty) with $.post, the resulting template has <tr><td>... hardcoded. however, the AJAX result strips all <tr> and <td>. any idea?
[02:01:15] <Cthulhux> (all contained html elements are still in place)
[02:01:23] <Cork> ?paste
[02:01:42] <Cork> gah, the bot is down again
[02:01:51] <Cork> Cthulhux: paste the relevant code in jsfiddle.net
[02:02:05] <Cthulhux> phew...
[02:02:10] <Cthulhux> one second, stripping it off
[02:08:27] <Cthulhux> not sure how this should help ;-) but, basically: http://jsfiddle.net/uL45vj2q/1/
[02:08:55] <Cthulhux> problem is that the result is only the div and the input
[02:08:56] <Cork> the relevant parts are missing
[02:08:57] <Cthulhux> :|
[02:09:11] <Cthulhux> which are the relevant parts then?
[02:09:11] <Cork> what part removes tr?
[02:09:19] <Cthulhux> precisely my question
[02:09:28] <Cork> well it isn't in that section
[02:09:47] <Cthulhux> alert(data) right after function(data) { already shows missing <tr>
[02:09:49] <Cthulhux> :/
[02:10:19] <Cork> so it happens server side
[02:10:21] <Uhkis> do those tr's even exist if you go check the html by hand?
[02:10:39] <Cthulhux> Uhkis: firebug says no
[02:10:40] <Cork> check the network tab and see what the server sends
[02:10:51] <Cork> Cthulhux: so the problem is server side not in js
[02:11:06] <Cork> specifically in "add-new-row.php"
[02:11:59] <Cthulhux> hmm, ok, the network tab says it comes
[02:12:05] <Cthulhux> with <tr> :o
[02:12:21] <Cork> but there isn't anything between that and $.post response...
[02:12:43] <Cthulhux> you might see why i'm confused?
[02:12:45] <Cthulhux> :/
[02:16:46] <Cork> Cthulhux: the only answer to how that would happen would be if something replaces $.post
[02:17:13] <Cork> Cthulhux: so, do you have a link?
[02:19:06] <Cthulhux> it's a project in our intranet. :-/ i wish i had
[02:19:38] <Cthulhux> i process $.post completely unfiltered, i parse it AFTER it's already wrong
[02:19:59] <Cork> Cthulhux: and the response is text/html?
[02:20:18] <Cthulhux> text/html; charset=UTF-8
[02:20:20] <Cthulhux> yup
[02:20:28] <Cork> then there isn't anything i can help you with
[02:20:39] <Cthulhux> :(
[02:20:50] <Cork> the response from $.post is just a straight dump of responseText in those cases
[02:21:24] <Cork> the only way i could help you would need access to the live page
[02:23:05] <Cthulhux> the responseText is correct but jQuery somehow modifies it. i thought there was something i could have missed :/ well, thanks for your time though
[02:23:13] <Cork> no it donse'
[02:23:16] <Cork> *doesn't
[02:23:18] <Cthulhux> (the live version works fine ... but it's a different design)
[02:23:28] <Cthulhux> (so i guess my new design has a mistake)
[02:23:33] <Cork> something outside of jquery has to do it
[02:23:42] <Cthulhux> ok :/
[02:34:37] <sebdg15> Hi all,
[02:34:37] <sebdg15> I have to select all elements between two given elements into the dom
[02:34:44] <sebdg15> these are a flat list of spans some ids, others not, i need to make a highlighter that could highlight stuff without making te dom hierachical
[02:35:16] <Cork> sebdg15: $('#start').nextAllUntil('#end')
[02:36:04] <Cork> sebdg15: ah, no ignoring the hierarchy won't be possible
[02:36:15] <sebdg15> Cork: omg, :-) great
[02:36:29] <Cork> nextAllUntil can only grab siblings
[02:43:01] <sebdg15> hmm I can't find nextAllUntil actually one or the other but noth the mix
[02:45:42] <Cork> opps right
[02:45:58] <Cork> sebdg15: All is implied there
[02:46:00] <Cork> nextUntil
[02:46:04] <Cork> is what you want
[02:46:53] <sebdg15> i was right testing that one now
[02:47:02] <sebdg15> and it works like a charm
[02:47:15] <sebdg15> thanks again Cork

I have follow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10913703/adding-pause-on-hover-to-setinterval but no luck, Anyway do anyone have idea for it?
[03:07:34] <parveen> BenL90 it shows any error in console ?
[03:07:48] <Cork> BenL90: you should use requestAnimatinoFrame + setTimeout instead of setInterval
[03:09:14] <mdunbavan1985> Hi can anyone help with a json object query I need to look at? Here is the gist https://gist.github.com/mdunbavan/56d7bf823f7f1f48ec1e
[03:10:35] <mdunbavan1985> I am basically trying to access objects inside the 'work_content' object, each object nested in here is ordered by the backend and what i want to do is get each one based on the layout name and serve the results differently for each object.
[03:11:14] <BenL90> Cork: No Error, Paarveen: No error
[03:11:28] <BenL90> Cork: Anyway what is that things?
[03:11:28] <mdunbavan1985> The order they come in is setup in the back-end via the user who can order the index, so the front-end needs to keeo the index of the objects respectfully the same
[03:11:55] <BenL90> Okay, Just try Fiddle..
[03:35:11] <al-damiri> Hi #jquery.
[03:35:33] <al-damiri> How can I select all the <tr> which have any input in their <input /> elements?
[03:36:44] <al-damiri> i.e. non-empty is it possible?
[03:38:36] <decx> input elements with input elements in them?
[03:38:50] <decx> i think there is no such thing
[03:39:18] <al-damiri> decx: No.
[03:39:42] <al-damiri> decx: I have few input elements in each row. I want to select all the rows whose input elements are non-empty.
[03:39:50] <al-damiri> decx: That is, they have some value entered in it.
[03:41:12] <decx> so why go from your tr and not just serialize your form`?
[03:43:43] <al-damiri> decx: How would I be able to validate the data then?
[03:43:52] <al-damiri> decx: I need to process it too before sending.
[03:44:15] <decx> validation is a very broad topic
[03:44:21] <decx> too broad to reinvent the wheel
[03:44:50] <decx> $('tr').find('input').filter(function(){ return this.value.length; }) this will return a collection with all inputs in tr that have a value

[03:48:26] <designelf> hello, i am looking for help with a jquery datepicker
[03:48:57] <designelf> i need to have  multiple instances on the same page, do you know how I can do that?
[03:51:16] <Cork> multiple instances?
[03:51:20] <Cork> you mean multiple versions?
[03:52:09] <designelf> i am not a coder so not sure what to call it... I need to have the datepicker in more than one place on the page... so i have a few fields that need dates and I want a datepicker in each spot
[03:52:27] <Cork> datepicker should handle that by default
[03:52:36] <Cork> as long as you use a selector that matches all the fields
[03:54:28] <designelf> well this is the code i have in the head tag
[03:54:30] <designelf>   <link rel="stylesheet" href="jquery-ui-datepicker.css">
[03:54:30] <designelf>   <script src="jquery-1.10.2-datepicker.js"></script>
[03:54:30] <designelf>   <script src="jquery-ui-datepicker.js"></script>
[03:54:30] <designelf>   <script>
[03:54:30] <designelf>   $(function() {
[03:54:31] <designelf>     $( "#datepicker" ).datepicker();
[03:54:31] <designelf>   });
[03:54:32] <designelf>   </script>
[03:55:06] <Cork> designelf: don't paste code in the channel
[03:55:12] <designelf> i put the code in and made sure each field is called "datepicker" but it is not working
[03:55:19] <Cork> designelf:  $( "#datepicker" ) can only match one element
[03:55:25] <designelf> oh.. sorry... where should i paste it?
[03:55:29] <Cork> as ids can only match one element
[03:55:35] <designelf> right
[03:55:35] <Cork> jsfiddle.net
[03:55:43] <morlenxus> Hey, short question: Should i use dialog ("close") or dialog ("destroy") to remove a dialog?
[03:56:29] <designelf> so what would i have to put to make multiple fields work?
[03:57:14] <designelf> sorry.... i know this is like a kindergarten question o.o;;
[03:57:33] <Cork> designelf: you should give them a class and use that instead
[03:57:58] <Cork> morlenxus: close will just close the dialog, destroy restores the html to how it was before you initialized .dialog
[03:58:23] <designelf> i am not sure how to do that....
[03:58:53] <Cork> designelf: then you would have to ask someone how does to do the job for you; or learn the basics
[03:59:01] <designelf> :)
[04:00:02] <designelf> well, thank you for your help, sometimes i can figure it out but seems this time is more than my ability
[04:10:44] <lintguy> I have this:
[04:10:46] <lintguy> thisElement.val('').trigger('change');
[04:10:47] <lintguy> $('.saveItemButton').trigger('click');
[04:11:00] <lintguy> But the savebutton trigger before the val change.
[04:11:10] <lintguy> How do i chain such an event?
[04:13:38] <taplar> lintguy: what are you seeing that makes you think the click is happening first?
[04:13:43] <Cork> lintguy: most likely something outside of that code trigger that event
[04:14:04] <Cork> cause no those calls are sync so click there will happen after
[04:14:42] <lintguy> That's what i expected, but if i remove the save click event, the val clears as expected and no save is happening.
[04:15:48] <Bjerre> zup guys
[04:16:08] <taplar> Bjerre: sup.  your turning into a regular in here, :D
[04:16:22] <Bjerre> yea :D
[04:16:34] <lintguy> Ah… stupid silly me, but if the save click is initiated AFTER this code, then it would become an issue.
[04:17:15] <lintguy> Noep… That wasn't it
[04:18:43] <morlenxus> Cork: I'm creating the dialog completly by javascript, but i expect that when using close that the browser gets slower and slower with each generated dialog, so i should use destroy - right?
[04:18:59] <morlenxus> Does destroy also run the defined close function?
[04:20:49] <taplar> morlenxus: how many dialogs are you creating?
[04:28:28] <morlenxus> taplar: Well it's a system which should run the whole day, so i expect in the end of the day that there have been ~100 dialogs.
[04:28:52] <taplar> morlenxus: all the dialogs are unique?
[04:31:45] <Bjerre> guys how can I add or replace images inside of a div with javascript? the commented lines in the javascript is what I want to add http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/oe41e2xw/
[04:32:15] <Bjerre> the thing is that I dont know how many images it will be in the first place and therefor I dont want placeholders
[04:33:33] <EdwardIII> hrm, i'm trying to manually $(window).trigger('resize') inside $(function(){}); docready stuff but it doesn't seem to be firing?
[04:33:44] <EdwardIII> it's a workaround for a stupid plugin that has no 'reload' command
[04:34:04] <Chulbul> taplar , hi .. whatsup ?
[04:34:25] <decx> where do you get the imagelist from Bjerre?
[04:36:29] <Bjerre> decx the thing is that in the project I have a div with 4 images. However, the customer wants to add more pictures over time but they and I wont have the time to edit the code itself. The easiest way I found was to make a guide for them on how to easily add the new images to a folder and copy (replace one digit) the code inside the javascript. Then when the SPA loads it will load the javascript and replace the div.
[04:37:03] <Bjerre> or replace the images inside with new ones and more of them
[04:37:23] <Bjerre> I know how to replace texts but I'm not quite sure on how to add more img src
[04:38:45] <decx> it's just a new element
[04:38:50] <decx> create it like oyu would any other
[04:39:09] <decx> $('<img>', { src: 'src url' })
[04:39:19] <decx> then you can append that whereever
[04:39:23] <Bjerre> oh ok
[04:39:27] <EdwardIII> anyone seen this? problems manually triggering window resize?
[04:39:33] <Bjerre> ty decx
[04:39:39] <EdwardIII> is it something to do with the dom lifecycle? like you can't trigger resize before load or something?
[04:40:22] <EdwardIII> or that triggering resize doens't work because the browsers ignore it unless the dimensions of the window have actually changed?
[04:40:43] <decx> doesnt matter
[04:40:47] <decx> trigger is trigger
[04:42:28] <morlenxus> taplar: Yes, all dialogs are unique.
[04:42:46] <morlenxus> Each created by javascript, content is loaded by dialog.load();
[04:44:02] <EdwardIII> hrm seems to happen in jsfiddle too: http://jsfiddle.net/jovz6qLa/1/
[04:44:47] <decx> addEventListener is empty
[04:44:48] <EdwardIII> ah wait no it doens't
[04:44:52] <EdwardIII> http://jsfiddle.net/jovz6qLa/2/
[04:45:09] <decx> which doesnt matter because jquery fires its own event
[04:45:30] <decx> jquery resize is just a rebuilt native resize event
[04:45:57] <EdwardIII> my expectation here is that 'output' gets the text "resize event fired": http://jsfiddle.net/jovz6qLa/4/
[04:46:35] <decx> use $(window).on('resize',function(){
[04:46:46] <decx> because as said, native events != jquery events
[04:46:49] <EdwardIII> decx: i can't, i'm trying to do a workaround for a 3rd party lib
[04:47:02] <EdwardIII> hrm right
[04:47:12] <EdwardIII> so if i want to trigger native resize i have to use native js not jquery?
[04:48:21] <Bjerre> decx: went for regular javascript http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/oe41e2xw/3/
[04:48:21] <EdwardIII> i'm basically trying to force this: https://github.com/jedfoster/Readmore.js/blob/master/readmore.js#L155
[04:48:55] <decx> EdwardIII:  http://jsfiddle.net/decx/jovz6qLa/5/
[04:49:27] <EdwardIII> why didn't the guy use $(window).resize(...) instead of native? he's writing a jquery plugin
[04:49:31] <rfc19> Ignoring the CSS, why am I unable to load the ID of the element in here -- http://jsfiddle.net/8qwgzog0/ ?
[04:50:03] <Bjerre> the only problem decx is that they wont understand on how to add more images with a code like that
[04:52:08] <EdwardIII> grrr
[04:52:12] <EdwardIII> this DOM stuff is doing my head in
[04:52:48] <EdwardIII> i just wanted a simple 'read more' link for text. when the page renders the text is hidden, so the plugin can't calculate the height. the plugin does it's work after .load() which makes sense, because images in the text or whatever might contain images and not have full height until after load
[04:53:07] <EdwardIII> so my workaround was to show the elements, trigger a window resize event, then hide the elements again
[04:53:46] <EdwardIII> buuut that doesn't work
[04:54:06] <EdwardIII> however now at least the event is triggering, so thanks for that decx
[04:54:31] <EdwardIII> i didn't know jQuery had it's own event system for stuff like window.resize that was disconnected in some ways from the native resize
[04:55:13] <Chulbul> taplar_afk , hello
[04:55:19] <decx> it's attempting to normalize events but imho still falls flat at stuff like resize or mousemove because there are still large differences in how browsers fire them
[04:55:59] <EdwardIII> i guess it's happening because i trigger window resize, then dom load happens again afterwards anyway, and the plugin recalculates that everything has 0 height because it's wrapper is display: none or some such
[04:56:08] <EdwardIII> ballache
[04:56:46] <EdwardIII> ahhh i can trigger a resize whenever the containing element opens or closes! kinda like masonry.reload(). job's a good'un
[04:58:36] <Bjerre> really confused, why isn't this working decx http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/oe41e2xw/4/
[04:59:31] <decx> you already are in the onload event
[04:59:55] <Bjerre> oh no wrap in head, got it
[05:09:02] <rfc19> I'm trying to replace 'div1' with the next clicked div (div2 or div3). How can I detect which div is active and replace it with the new div?
[05:10:58] <Bjerre> decx: how would you get it running without removing it from the head? http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/oe41e2xw/5/
[05:11:14] <Bjerre> just of curiousity
[05:11:27] <Bjerre> or is it loading before the div?
[05:16:29] <Bjerre> decx: ? :(
[05:44:15] <Bjerre> http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/5dkwdg6v/7/ Any idea on how to get the "add img" working properly?
[05:44:48] <Bjerre> I assume it has to do that slides loads before the click?
[05:46:21] <Bjerre> sry here http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/5dkwdg6v/8/
[05:49:57] <Cork> Bjerre: never use event attributes
[05:50:14] <Bjerre> why?
[05:50:30] <Cork> cause it doesn't have scope handling
[05:50:36] <Cork> and it doesn't work well with event handlers
[05:50:37] <Bjerre> hmm ok
[05:50:45] <Cork> and it is a legacy interface
[05:50:56] <Bjerre> how would you suggest the code should be then?
[05:51:08] <Cork> Bjerre: http://jsfiddle.net/5dkwdg6v/9/
[05:51:49] <Bjerre> ye that worked thanks man. it popped down and didn't join the slider thought, dno why
[05:52:02] <Bjerre> but I assume it has to do which one loads first
[05:52:04] <Bjerre> right?
[05:52:46] <Bjerre> the click is only for demonstration, it should rather be added as an external javascript which loads on page
[05:53:06] <Cork> the slider most likely builds an array as it starts
[05:53:28] <Bjerre> ye
[05:53:28] <Cork> you would have to check for a command to update/add the list
[05:53:33] <morlenxus> How do i arrange the textbox in the bottom of the dialog to the right of the input fields? Should i use a table or is there a better way: http://omicron.homeip.net/filedump/dialog.jpg
[05:53:35] <Bjerre> :/ damn
[05:53:58] <Cork> morlenxus: you could float the field
[05:54:41] <morlenxus> Cork: You mean style='float:right;' ?
[05:54:55] <cjohnson> I asked last night but nobody was around so I'll repeat. I am using jquery validator and I added a custom validation method. Then I added an attribute to my <input> (my validation rules are all defined as inline html attributes) of the same name as the method but it doesn't appear to be firing. anybody know how exactly I need to add custom inline validation methods?
[05:54:56] <Cork> for example ya
[05:55:16] <Cork> cjohnson: split the backstory and questiobn
[05:55:19] <Cork> *question
[05:55:37] <cjohnson> que?
[05:56:08] <Cork> you currently posted a 6 line long blob of text
[05:56:13] <morlenxus> Cork: When applying to the textblock, nothing happens.
[05:56:18] <Cork> separate the question and keep it short
[05:57:03] <cjohnson> I posted 2 lines? is your client acting up?
[05:57:10] <cjohnson> it's fairly short as it is
[05:57:21] <decx> it's not that much text, i glanced over it and it was clearly: custom inline validator rules
[05:57:23] <Cork> no that isn't anything like short
[05:57:31] <cjohnson> well, it is *shrug*
[05:57:44] <cjohnson> anyway by now you could have read it. or you can choose not to and ignore it :)
[05:59:04] <cjohnson> about the only wholly unnecessary part is the first sentence. the rest heads off possible erroneous suggestions before they are offered (such as: define the rule in your .validate() config)
[05:59:45] <decx> not quite the same but there is addClassRules
[05:59:54] <Uhkis> and now you typed a bunch of pointless lines instead of doing what was suggested ;)
[06:00:11] <cjohnson> what was suggested doesn't fix or improve anything, certainly doesn't solve the issue
[06:00:42] <decx> am i the only one thinking about the solution instead of bickering? ^^
[06:01:18] <Uhkis> yes :)
[06:01:43] <Bjerre> Cork: any idea on where that command would be in the slidesjs?
[06:01:49] <Cork> nope
[06:01:53] <Bjerre> ok
[06:01:56] <cjohnson> decx: I feel like that won't exactly solve it since the methods seem to be picked up via attributes anyway
[06:02:05] <cjohnson> I'll take a look
[06:02:08] <Bjerre> sucks :/
[06:04:27] <cjohnson> ok looks like the method is getting called it's just not returning what I thought so that threw me off. stupid mistake. thanks for your suggestion and attempt to actually help decx
[06:04:52] <Bjerre> Cork: it works if I delay the slide js
[06:04:56] <decx> i'm a bloody shining beacon of courtesy
[06:05:01] <Bjerre> not a great solution though
[06:05:20] <Bjerre> kinda awful to be honest
[06:05:33] <cjohnson> decx: lol
[06:08:16] <EdwardIII> god damnit i'm still struggling with this thing
[06:08:26] <Bjerre> decx: you know how to add the image inside the #slides? My problem is that the slides will be loaded before the image is added so it jumps out is not added to the slides script http://jsfiddle.net/5dkwdg6v/9/
[06:08:30] <EdwardIII> i implement a whole booking engine in a weekend and i've wasted a day trying to do show/hide on some text
[06:08:35] <EdwardIII> makes me so mad heh
[06:09:27] <Bjerre> I know how it feels EdwardIII. It feels like the smallest problems are always the worst. Glad to get great help here, wouldn't be able to do it if not.
[06:10:44] <johnnb> anyone around with some requireJS experience ? I've got a JS widget using it, and on one particular site it spits out "mismatched anonymous define module" at me, and that only 1 out of 4-5 times (and only on fresh load, if the widget is cached there's no errors)
[06:22:39] <Bjerre> Cork: is it possible to add multiple addChild?
[06:23:46] <Bjerre> or appendChild in this case
[06:26:04] <EdwardIII> holy cow a payment provider is using postMessage for iframe resizing on host. how awesome
[06:26:12] <EdwardIII> first time i've ever seen HTML5 features from these bozos
[06:28:33] <Cork> Bjerre: no you can't chain calls in native dom
[06:29:07] <Bjerre> ok
[06:29:19] <Bjerre> so same lines for each image?
[06:29:31] <Bjerre> if you saw this code Cork you would kill me
[06:44:59] <inthl> I'd need a hint where to find docs or a tutorial for the following responsive layout problem: there are two columns, say 1 and 2, and they are being displayed as: [1 | 2 ] ...that is easy for sure. now I'd like, for say mobile devices, that these cols are one below the other, ...what is easy as well. but the difference is that it should be the 2-column first, then the 1-column below
[06:46:14] <cjohnson> inthl: you could use a media query to float them both left (or right, I forget which) such that the second item comes first
[06:48:20] <inthl> hm
[06:51:00] <inthl> floating is not really an option here :/
[06:51:43] <cjohnson> I don't know how else, but your question is almost definitely a #css question, not a #jquery question
[06:54:31] <samssh> If I throw an exception in a .done() or .fail() ($.ajax().done().fail().always()), will the .always() callback still be called? Assuming the exception is caught in the method call above the $.ajax call.
[06:55:42] <cjohnson> you can't throw from an async callback and catch it in a try{ } wrapped around the async method
[06:55:47] <cjohnson> it will throw too late
[06:56:17] <cjohnson> errors handled in promisey things are generally handled by putting a .catch(), or in the case of jquery deferred I believe .fail and/or .always at the end
[06:57:45] <tswartz> can someone tell me what i'm missing on my selector to get the input value? http://jsfiddle.net/m91bc76e/1/
[06:59:29] <cjohnson> what are you trying to do with :text there?
[06:59:50] <tswartz> get the text value of the input
[06:59:50] <cjohnson> I think you want input[type=text][name=...]
[07:00:11] <cjohnson> no .val() gets the text value of the input
[07:00:17] <cjohnson> I was asking about input:text[name=...]
[07:00:34] <cjohnson> :text is not, afaik, a psuedo-selector that jquery has defined
[07:01:03] <tswartz> cjohnson, https://api.jquery.com/text-selector/ ?
[07:01:27] <tswartz> although i now see in the notes about [type="text"]
[07:01:34] <tswartz> i'm no jquery expert here ;)
[07:01:55] <cjohnson> oh, it appears I'm wrong
[07:02:46] <cjohnson> oh ok so your issue is that the input is not a sibling of the form
[07:02:48] <cjohnson> it's a child
[07:02:58] <cjohnson> instead of siblings just use $(this).find('input:text...')
[07:03:05] <cjohnson> the submit event fires from the form itself
[07:04:10] <tswartz> nice, that works
[07:09:19] <samssh> cjohnson, It would seem that Ajax deferred callback exceptions are ignored unless you setup a custom handler with an Ajax setup method.
[07:13:41] <cjohnson> what do you mean ignored? make a jsfiddle please
[07:14:29] <samssh> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2721983/exceptions-thrown-in-jquery-ajax-callbacks-swallowed
[07:17:39] <cjohnson> that's talking about throwing exceptions inside the success handler
[07:17:43] <cjohnson> your question was from within a .done
[07:18:59] <cjohnson> looks like exceptions thrown inside a .done() are not caught by later .done
[07:19:07] <cjohnson> however you can do .done().done()
[07:19:34] <cjohnson> honestly I'm not sure how to handle exceptions in jquery deferreds. in promises you would simply .catch
[07:20:42] <samssh> For this situation I refactored to get rid of the throw.
[07:22:50] <cjohnson> prob for the best. If you needed throws I would probably promisify the jquery deferred
[07:47:07] <cool_boy> hay guys, is it possible to validate input on a prompt from smoke.js ? I want to insert only numbers, how can I use keypress event on that?
[07:52:49] <Cthulhux> meanwhile, i fixed my issue
[07:52:57] <Cthulhux> had to specify "text" as my last parameter
[07:53:36] <Cthulhux> seems like jQuery tries to "parse" a result for completeness; loading a "table row" (only <tr>...</tr>) into an existing table will fail because it's not a valid HTML table
[07:53:43] <Cthulhux> wtf factor: 9000. :/
[07:54:57] <dan2k3k4> I have a bunch of: <div 'media_iframe' data-url='some_url'></div>
[07:55:31] <dan2k3k4> with diff urls... and want to loop each then create iframe and set src="data-url" - but when iframe is loaded, THEN continue the loop
[07:55:45] <dan2k3k4> at the moment it seems to do everything at once (i.e. loads all iframes at once)
[08:04:35] <mooncup> anyone know why this would work:
[08:04:37] <mooncup> $('.button-active:not(.show-all-button)').click(function() {
[08:04:44] <mooncup> but this wouldn't:
[08:04:45] <mooncup> $(document).on('.button-active:not(.show-all-button)','click',function() {
[08:04:54] <mooncup> even though I've not modified the elements after page load at all
[08:07:12] <shoky> mooncup:  event comes first in .on(), then selector
[08:07:28] <xckpd7_> question: so I have an input and I'm using a click event to select the text. simple enough. But if the text is really long and the user is dumb and decides to select the text from right to left, then it's possible that they'll miss text that should have been selected
[08:07:39] <xckpd7_> is there anyway to account for this usecase?
[08:07:48] <mooncup> shoky: of course it does
[08:07:48] <mooncup> thanks
[08:14:34] <catcher> What's the best way to create a list of elements w/ a common clas?
[08:14:36] <catcher> class*
[09:06:23] <srsgores> is there a way to .filter() by the parent that owns the elements?
[09:10:21] <shoky> srsgores: you can filter by anything you want, if you pass a function to .filter()
[09:21:08] <leporello> Hi. Who can remind name of plugin, which creates circles in press place.
[09:23:17] <arup_r> Hi..  am getting error -- https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/e52cf1445f06077b6e10#file-booking-js-L4
[09:23:35] <arup_r> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[09:23:48] <arup_r> hints pls what wrong I did.. I am noob.
[09:24:47] <shoky> arup_r: it's  if (condition) ...
[09:25:08] <arup_r> bracket is needed.. oh i see
[09:25:13] <shoky> btw you have the same code for the if and the else parts
[09:25:45] <arup_r> I'll change it,. just writing step by step..
[09:25:46] <arup_r> :)
[09:25:54] <arup_r> I am a Ruby Programmer
[09:26:04] <arup_r> so JS will take time syntax wise..
[09:27:23] <cluelessperson> hey guys, what do you think the easiest way to handle tabbing is?
[09:28:04] <cluelessperson> I'm thinking.    $('.tabs .tab').click(   make visible/active  the div with matching #id   or something
[10:10:45] <jim_j> will $("a.l-button").attr("href", function(i, href) {  return href + 'ID=' + id;});  affect all instances of class .l-button or only the first one?
[10:19:44] <TylerE> How can I use a 'ancestor decendent' selector to select the anscestor? e.g. select all p tags containing a img tag.
[10:36:45] <cluelessperson> Does anyone have any ideas for autocompleting text from mysql or a database.
[10:41:19] <diegoviola> I'm doing an ajax request with $.post() but apart from sending my form data via $.post() I also want to show what the user wrote from the input on the screen, how can I grab the text and slap it to a div?
[10:46:12] <diegoviola> I already have a submit hook on my code
[10:46:19] <Uhkis> use .val()
[10:46:37] <diegoviola> right
[10:46:38] <diegoviola> thanks
[10:52:37] <aro> is tehre a way to unbind an .on binding to a node when applying it to document.body
[10:52:54] <aro> $(document.body).on('click', '#element', function() { });
[10:52:59] <aro> like remove the binding to #element
[10:56:51] <cjohnson> .off
[10:57:25] <cjohnson> aro: what are you doing though? that's usually wrong
[10:57:36] <cjohnson> generally the better approach is to just put an if statement inside your event handler
[10:57:42] <cjohnson> only fire the logic if the condition is met
[10:58:08] <leberweber> is anyone of you at jQuery SF?
[10:58:49] <aro> i have an ajax table with a bunch of buttons with on handlers
[10:59:02] <aro> trouble is - we wipe the table and rebuild it
[10:59:07] <cjohnson> use event delegation
[10:59:08] <aro> and then there are multiple bindings
[10:59:11] <aro> how?
[10:59:12] <cjohnson> only bind once
[10:59:22] <cjohnson> oh well you basically already have it but fix your code to not use IDs
[10:59:23] <cjohnson> use classes
[10:59:37] <cjohnson> such that subsequently rebuilt tables have the same class and thus the same binding will apply
[11:07:00] <aro> is there a way to check to see if a binding exists?
[11:11:58] <cjohnson> not that I know of, which is all the more reason to stop trying to do the bind/unbind approach
[11:12:04] <cjohnson> and just fix it to use properly delegated events.
[11:12:16] <diegoviola> any ideas how to improve this code? http://sprunge.us/ShTY?js
[11:12:28] <diegoviola> it's just some ajax thing
[11:16:34] <cjohnson> does it not behave well for you?
[11:17:24] <diegoviola> it does
[11:18:09] <diegoviola> I was wondering if I could split the code in different functions
[11:18:24] <cjohnson> you can do anything you want it's programming :)
[11:18:31] <diegoviola> sure
[11:18:33] <diegoviola> but
[11:18:39] <decx> seems specific enough to warrant not being separated
[11:18:41] <diegoviola> I'm not sure if I understand JS enough to do this
[11:19:18] <decx> if you reuse that same code a bunch of times then you can make general functions
[11:19:24] <diegoviola> ok
[11:19:44] <diegoviola> ty
[11:22:39] <cannap> hey i know this is the wrong channel but any good with chrome extensions?
[11:33:36] <Jabberwock> Hi all. Is there a library for auto-suggestions that can take a JSON object? e.g. I have module.subModules[X].tags.split(',')
[11:33:56] <cjohnson> twitter typeahead accepts json objects
[11:34:04] <cjohnson> it's pretty robust
[11:34:28] <decx> i feel like typeahead is needlessly complicated
[11:35:12] <Jabberwock> Thank you both. decx: I am looking for pretty basic, google-esque functionality.
[11:35:16] <Jabberwock> Not that theirs is necessarily basic.
[11:35:55] <Jabberwock> I could do it myself but I feel like the highlighting part will be tedious
[11:36:16] <Jabberwock> along with the dropdown (keeping it accessible etc)
[11:36:26] <cjohnson> it's not needlessly complicated, it's robust. if you don't need all the features then for your specific use case it becomes needless
[11:36:50] <cjohnson> but to call a saws-all complicated when a hand-saw does the job of cutting one single twig in half is to misunderstand hte point of the saws-all
[11:36:54] <cjohnson> :P
[11:37:43] <decx> well i do prefer a hand-saw
[11:38:04] <decx> but the option to strap a bloodhound on that saw isn't terrible
[11:38:06] <SteenJobs> sup brothas
[11:38:07] <cjohnson> for cutting a single twig, it does the job fine
[11:38:17] <decx> but for my handsaw needs i like autocomplete.js
[11:40:10] <SteenJobs> i’m trying to save the location of images on a canvas with respect to the containing div, and then redraw the images on a new differently sized canvas but in the same position propotionately.
[11:40:45] <SteenJobs> would it make sense to do, canvas.offset().left - $(this).offset().left,  to get the position of an image on the first canvas, and then divide that value by the width in pixels of the first canvas to get the proportions correct?
[11:40:58] <decx> and what part of the 2nd grade math is too complicated? /s
[11:41:15] <SteenJobs> decx: hey let’s play nice
[11:41:34] <SteenJobs> decx: just wanted to make sure with the way .offset() works that the reasoning would still apply
[11:42:01] <SteenJobs> decx: after studying math, it’s not the math i’m worried about. i’m just much newer to jquery than i am to math.
[11:42:10] <decx> you cant call offset on a canvas element tho
[11:42:38] <SteenJobs> decx: i just called it that. it’s actually a div
[11:42:55] <amtrivedi> Hello
[11:42:56] <amtrivedi> I have used a jquery dialog on a webpage, now when I fill that dialog box and submit it everything is fine, but if I click on the cross on the top right hand corner I am not able to open the dialog again.
[11:43:00] <decx> if the jquery makes the problem then your answer makes sense again SteenJobs, and i'm always nice ;)
[11:43:10] <decx> question
[11:43:11] <decx> not answer
[11:43:13] <decx> good lord
[11:43:16] <decx> i need a break
[11:43:29] <SteenJobs> decx: hahah
[11:43:37] <SteenJobs> decx: wait what do you mean?
[11:43:45] <decx> yeah offset() is relative to the document
[11:44:05] <SteenJobs> decx: ok cool. i’ll give it a go. such a pain getting it all to play nice, had to do the same thing with width/height of the images
[11:44:15] <SteenJobs> decx: all to just display a damn clothing outfit. jeez.
[11:44:29] <decx> keep us posted
[11:44:38] <SteenJobs> decx: ha ok
[11:44:43] <decx> i remember when i had an actual canvas that had max-width 100
[11:44:58] <decx> getting the mouseinput to translate to the right position was a whole saga
[11:45:11] <decx> max-width: 100%
[11:48:10] <amtrivedi> If anyone could help me out? I cannot open the dialog again if I close it by clicking the cross on the top right corner.
[11:48:36] <decx> try to reproduce it in a fiddle
[11:49:00] <decx> this is all very theoretical to give any if nobody has encountered the problem yet
[11:49:15] <decx> give any tips*
[11:49:17] <decx> man
[11:49:21] <decx> i'm missing words
[11:49:24] <decx> that's it
[11:49:26] <decx> later
[11:50:18] <amtrivedi> decx: Unfortunately, my template has a lot of css and js dependencies so sharing a fiddle won't be productive.
[11:50:36] <amtrivedi> Actually, I am rendering an existing template via a popup.
[11:51:17] <Jabberwock> decx, cjohnson: Thanks! Sorry - very busy. Wasn't ignoring.
[11:51:50] <Jabberwock> I'm taking another security cert. and I felt like redoing their training materials to get away from Flash, so this will be a fun side project. :)
[11:53:45] <SteenJobs> decx: it’s incredible how under appreciated this stuff is for people that don’t know what goes into it
[12:30:46] <alaing> hi
[12:30:58] <alaing> anyone around?
[12:31:19] <decx> no
[12:31:44] <decx> i'm just an italian robot, and the only words i know are "no" and this sentence explaining what i can't do
[12:39:48] <Kartagis> so I've been helped many times by a robot?
[12:43:54] <tpavlek> So I have a javascript module for a "buzzer" system, and it's in it's own js file that does window.buzzer = (function() {}(window.buzzer || {})) - I'm trying to test this with QUnit, but this buzzer object has state.
[12:43:58] <Pazician> decx: Lol.
[12:44:05] <tpavlek> Is there a way to destroy a window variable between QUnit tests?
[12:44:11] <tpavlek> Or am I thinking about this completely wrong?
[12:46:10] <Uhkis> decx: again with the family guy
[12:47:12] <SteenJobs> decx: finally fucking got it. boom
[12:47:21] <SteenJobs> decx: brain shitting dopamine everywhere
[12:47:47] <SteenJobs> decx: also huge points fo a family reference. love it.
[12:58:53] <decx> the self referential foreigner bit is a reference?
[12:59:01] <decx> damnit i have no original thoughts
[13:01:19] <SteenJobs> decx: it’s a great line though.
[13:28:28] <cjohnson> tpavlek: most test suites have a "set up" and "tear down" function that runs between tests
[13:28:37] <cjohnson> tpavlek: but you could always fix your module to not have state :)
[13:28:43] <cjohnson> put the state in the application
[13:29:43] <SteenJobs> if i have hash = {}, how can i add a hash to that hash to create multiple nested hashes?
[13:41:39] <cjohnson> it's an object, not a hash, and you simply assign your second object to a property of the first
[13:41:54] <cjohnson> var foo = {}; var bar = {a: 'a'}; foo.b = bar;
[13:42:06] <cjohnson> or var foo = {b: {a: 'a'}};
[13:42:32] <cjohnson> the value of the property can be anything, including a function
[14:35:41] <SteenJobs> cjohnson: thanks!! that did it for me :)
[14:35:58] <SteenJobs> decx: you still here, thou holy one?
[14:36:19] <SteenJobs> decx: can’t figure out why this isn’t working https://gist.github.com/SteenJobs/d08c74e6ed3952b19914.  It’s only applying to the first ‘canvas’, not the second.
[14:41:00] <SteenJobs> nvrm. was a stupid css issue.
[14:45:48] <decx> is the height prop a float or what's going on there?
[15:12:58] <KebabBob> Does .click() not work on elements that were created after the dom was ready?
[15:13:10] <Zzaichik> no
[15:13:24] <Zzaichik> not without the use of .on()
[15:14:21] <KebabBob> Ah I see it now in the docs. Do I put it in $(function() {}; or outside it?
[15:14:27] <Zzaichik> in
[15:14:34] <KebabBob> Thank you :)
[15:14:39] <Zzaichik> and you want to attach the event to an element that exists on dom load
[15:14:58] <Zzaichik> so like $('body').on('click', 'myelement', function() {///
[15:15:09] <Zzaichik> bind*
[15:16:43] <KebabBob> Great, works like a charm
[15:16:48] <KebabBob> Thanks, I appreciate the help :)
[15:49:02] <peterson_> when data is returned from a .get, how do i access the data if json is returned?
[15:50:46] <peterson_> nm, getJSON it is!
[16:06:52] <skinux> Does jquery have an easy method for replacing part of a form action?
[17:29:43] <Lencl> can I do .on('mouseover') ?
[17:29:56] <Lencl> it's not working, but is there an alternative to .mouseover()?
[17:30:41] <tw2113> last i thought, .on() was the replacement
[17:30:53] <tw2113> so may be worth trying to figure out why your test example isn't working
[17:49:45] <coldhead> so how about that web assembly
[18:01:00] <tw2113> coldy
[18:01:21] <tw2113> excited for your first day tomorrow?
[18:16:05] <Es0teric> whats up tw2113
[18:16:22] <Es0teric> does anyone here know how to check if the window scroll is at the bottom?
[18:17:18] <tw2113> wouldn't you need to compare scroll position to window height
[18:18:07] <laurentide> i use fancybox in combination with bourbon refills, do i have to use .noConflict() ?
[18:23:48] <laurentide> the inspector is telling me $(...).fancybox is not a function
[18:24:26] <tw2113> i always use jQuery and pass in the $ alias
[18:24:47] <tw2113> jQuery(document).ready(function($){ ... });
[18:24:53] <tw2113> or some equivalent
[18:25:27] <laurentide> ok i'll try that for all my $(document).ready(function() lines
[18:29:07] <laurentide> hmm still showing the same error inspector
[18:29:34] <laurentide> in the inspector*
[18:39:00] <coldhead> tw2113: excited and a bit nervous
[19:02:22] <laurentide> gah this is drivin me nuts. i don't understand why i'm getting Uncaught TypeError: fancybox is not a function
[19:03:10] <rcyr> laurentide: Means that your fancybox script is not loaded properly...
[19:03:33] <laurentide> the inspector is able to load jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.pack.js okay
[19:03:59] <rcyr> Do you load jQuery before?
[19:04:02] <laurentide> yes
[19:04:20] <rcyr> Do you have multiple versions of jQuery on the page?
[19:04:30] <rcyr> Do you use noConflicts() or something similar?
[19:04:32] <laurentide> no. only 1.11.3.min.js
[19:04:50] <rcyr> Is jQuery loaded before fancybox?
[19:04:52] <Es0teric> how do i check if the scroll is at the bottom?
[19:04:59] <laurentide> i tried noConflicts() and it didn't make a difference... still tw2113's suggestions from earlier
[19:05:07] <laurentide> still using*
[19:05:12] <laurentide> jQuery is loaded before fancy box
[19:05:21] <rcyr> laurentide: Paste your HTML on a pastebin and give us a link :(
[19:05:56] <laurentide> not sure how to properly include the fancybox files in the bin or fiddle.. codepen let's me add external resources
[19:06:21] <laurentide> (aside from pasting the whole file contents in there)
[19:06:55] <rcyr> Paste the whole thing
[19:10:50] <laurentide> http://jsbin.com/horiwicoxu/1/edit?html,css,js
[19:11:22] <laurentide> haha sorry, that seems wrong to me dumping all that stuff in there...
[19:12:20] <laurentide> pasted in the a#single_image line twice... update: http://jsbin.com/bimitefaqu/1/edit?html,css,js
[19:13:58] <rcyr> Start by removing all the noConflict crap.
[19:14:10] <rcyr> You can't have a conflict if you only have a single version of jQuery
[19:59:37] <printForever> guys, is there some way I can use html in a line, without escaping him
[20:00:07] <printForever> for example, when I want to $().append('<div>....</div>');
[20:00:23] <printForever> escaping every single / and " drives me wild
[20:02:16] <printForever> guys...
[20:03:48] <ravenzz> guy...
[20:04:01] <printForever> dude...
[20:05:20] <arc_> i don't get it. you don't have to escape forwardslashes
[20:05:33] <ravenzz> bro
[20:05:34] <printForever> whaaat?
[20:05:41] <printForever> man...
[20:06:00] <printForever> yes you do
[20:06:11] <arc_> http://jsfiddle.net/3cbqz63b/
[20:06:14] <ravenzz> printForever:  '<div class="foo">foo</div>' doesn't need to be escaped
[20:06:32] <arc_> works for me
[20:06:49] <printForever> madda fakka... and I've been...
[20:06:55] <printForever> for the last 4 months...
[20:06:57] <printForever> that...
[20:06:59] <printForever> ugh!
[20:07:12] <ravenzz> printForever: it is a good idea to append to a dummy div and the grab its children()
[20:07:13] <printForever> freaking phpStorm and his idiotic color coding!!!
[20:07:33] <arc_> you did it because of syntax highlighting : (
[20:07:33] <printForever> like, I've never before escaped the html code
[20:07:42] <printForever> then I switched from Dw to phpStorm
[20:07:48] <printForever> because of file history
[20:08:03] <ravenzz> like $('.target').append($('<div>').html(yourHtmlString).children())
[20:08:06] <printForever> and the damn thing started showing errors in the JS code
[20:08:59] <printForever> yeah... that idiotic phpStorm syntax highlighiting and stupid code inspection that was showing errors
[20:09:12] <printForever> and I never thought to check if the code worked without escaping it first
[20:09:14] <printForever> OMG
[20:09:19] <arc_> lol : /
[20:09:21] <printForever> O.M.G.
[20:09:55] <printForever> yeah... well... that little info helped
[20:10:07] <printForever> tnx ravenzz and arc_
[20:10:21] <printForever> guys...
[20:10:22] <printForever> :)
[20:10:36] <printForever> I feel like a 100% grade idiot
[20:10:45] <printForever> talk to you later, bye
[20:17:41] <coldhead> lol
[20:18:35] <walabe> hello
[20:28:07] <walabe> Can someone help me workout why my spritespin (the 360 watch bit) is slow?? and not fast like this guy's? http://spritespin.ginie.eu/howto.html that's where I got it
[20:28:09] <walabe> here is my site http://chronox.netai.net/
[20:37:43] <acidjazz> whoa thats all sprites?
[20:38:00] <acidjazz> hah look at that bike go
[20:38:38] <acidjazz> oldschool
[20:45:36] <walabe> acidjazz what would be a better way to obtain a spinny object with pics
[20:45:58] <walabe> Why is mine so crappy and laggy, is it because it's inside another jquery thingo - the slider??
[20:49:31] <arup_r> 	I want to use `$(this).val()`  from here https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/0d20b30ea456c13eec07#file-booking-js-L3 inside this function https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/0d20b30ea456c13eec07#file-booking-js-L11 how to do so ?
[20:50:05] <acidjazz> arup_r: this is relevant to the inside of the functino, so you could var that = this before it, then $(that).val();
[20:50:32] <acidjazz> walabe: yorus isnt even moving for me
[20:50:37] <walabe> ughh
[20:50:54] <walabe> it's like really really slow, you have to try and move it 5 times for it to move 1 frame
[20:51:08] <acidjazz> walabe: is this watch real?
[20:51:15] <walabe> No haha
[20:51:27] <arc_> for me it moves once per click and drag
[20:51:44] <arc_> actually no i got it to work a little bit
[20:52:15] <arc_> is it supposed to automatically rotate
[20:52:19] <acidjazz> walabe: url your raw sprite
[20:52:23] <walabe> yeah that's what's happening to me 1 frame per long drag, it should be really smooth and fast - I think I'll just find another thing
[20:52:23] <acidjazz> i see 0 rotation
[20:52:32] <walabe> Okay hold on
[20:54:05] <walabe> The jquery is in the page's source, down the bottom, you'll see 4 of them, easy to spot because it's a big chunk of image sources over and over
[20:54:27] <walabe> the js is http://chronox.netai.net/assets/js/spritespin.js there but that's just what they gave me
[20:54:35] <acidjazz> why is there so much about this watch if it isnt real
[20:54:48] <walabe> it's not suppose to spin automatically I turned that off. But it's suppose to be smooth like the one on their example page
[20:55:02] <acidjazz> when is it suppose dto spin
[20:55:06] <walabe> Because it's for a school project acidjazz , high school final project thingo
[20:55:16] <walabe> when you drag it
[20:55:47] <acidjazz> when i mouseover? which area? the top?
[20:56:31] <walabe> Whenver you see that <--> cursor, your on the thing, when you drag it should move any area that your cursor is that <--> one
[20:57:14] <walabe> I forgot to mention the site only works on chrome + probably looks messed up on different resolutions
[20:57:32] <arc_> Uncaught InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'drawImage' on 'CanvasRenderingContext2D': The HTMLImageElement provided is in the 'broken' state.
[20:57:43] <arup_r> acidjazz: I tired.. what I am seeing is https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/0d20b30ea456c13eec07#file-booking-js-L16 is always giving the first select pkg value... Not working as expected..
[20:57:50] <arc_> so does that mean at least one of the linked images is broken
[20:57:51] <arup_r> *tried
[20:58:39] <walabe> i will double check everything
[20:59:46] <walabe> oh. the different colors of the watch are not appearing on this online version of the site for some reason
[21:01:21] <arc_> i was wondering why these are a different watch
[21:01:42] <walabe> oh hold on I haven't updated the img folders on the online site give me a minute
[21:03:46] <walabe> Okay i just put "animate" = "true" which makes them spin automatically. It works well with that so not sure why it's so slow when manually spinnning them
[21:04:12] <acidjazz> arup_r: so datepicker fires upon teh change?
[21:04:54] <acidjazz> arup_r: ah you dont need val() for an onchange select, you want option:selected
[21:05:37] <acidjazz> arup_r: oh hmm no val() would do that, that or $('option:selected', this);
[21:05:50] <acidjazz> arup_r: something to do w/ datepicker firing and when in that handler
[21:07:44] <walabe> I'm going to try using a different plugin
[21:11:20] <arup_r> If I try this https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/0d20b30ea456c13eec07#file-booking_v1-js .. datepicker is not putting any value..
[21:11:20] <arup_r> in the console..
[21:16:01] <arup_r> any idea how to do this ?
[21:20:09] <acidjazz> are you trying to grab what they choose for hte datepicker?
[21:21:55] <arup_r> acidjazz: my script is not completed..  But the idea is based on the packg_type value I want to make a weekday active and every other date inactive
[21:22:19] <arup_r> so I need the packg_type value inside the inner function to validate
[21:34:52] <arup_r> here is the output sequence I am getting -- https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/0d20b30ea456c13eec07
[21:36:56] <arup_r> first after refreshing the page I select the package type as weekend both the output is perfect. After that I select it as midweek, and then it is showing midweek weekend which is wrong....
[21:37:01] <arup_r> how to fix it ?
[21:41:13] <arup_r> any hints to me ?
[21:45:01] <AcidRain2012> hello
[21:45:24] <AcidRain2012> im trying to think of a way to get alot of data from a post request and auto fill a few form elements with it
[21:45:38] <AcidRain2012> like... 5 things. some numbers, text, booleans.
[21:45:41] <AcidRain2012> what is the best way to do this?
[21:46:37] <AcidRain2012> obviously returning it as an array wont work
[21:46:51] <AcidRain2012> because of the text return that will break it
[21:51:55] <AcidRain2012> actually i was formatting the array wrong. works perfect :)
[22:23:44] <rfc19> Hello, what's the best way to ensure a menu item remains underlined if clicked, but then cleared once another menu item is clicked? I've tried 'addClass' but that stays there indefinitely and I'm not sure on the best/most efficient way to 'remove class'
[22:25:11] <coldhead> you're on the right track
[22:25:42] <coldhead> at the point where you're calling addClass(), immediately before that select the same class and removeClass it
[22:26:01] <coldhead> $('.active').removeClass('active'); $(this).addClass('active');
[22:27:04] <rfc19> coldhead: ok, thanks. I'll give it a shot!
[22:28:19] <rfc19> coldhead: works a treat, however it's a single-page site that has the same class for multiple sub-menu items. When I click a menu item in section 2, it removes the active class from section 1
[22:28:32] <rfc19> Do I just need to be smarter with my selectors?
[22:28:44] <coldhead> yes
[22:29:55] <coldhead> depends on the markup but you'll want something like $('li li.active').removeClass('active')
[22:30:01] <coldhead> to only select the nested elements
[22:30:08] <rfc19> coldhead: Ok, for example, let's say I have <ul id="sec1-menu"><li class="item">about</li></ul> and <ul id="sec2-menu"><li class="item">about</li></ul>
[22:30:29] <rfc19> can I do something like $('#sec1-menu > .item').removeClass('active') ?
[22:30:43] <coldhead> yes that looks like a good approach
[22:30:51] <rfc19> great, time to test
[22:31:25] <coldhead> you might not need the > descendant selector, see how you go
[22:32:25] <al-damiri> What's the correct way to have multiple <input> fields in each row in a <table />?
[22:32:34] <al-damiri> Are you supposed to wrap the table within a <form />
[22:33:15] <rfc19> coldhead: thanks a lot! That worked with the descendant selector.
[22:33:29] <AcidBeard> al-damiri: that's what I do
[22:33:40] <al-damiri> AcidBeard: Okay.
[22:34:46] <rfc19> coldhead: is there a way to do something like $(this > span)
[22:34:56] <rfc19> because my true markup is like <li><span>text</span></li>
[22:37:38] <AcidBeard> $(this).children('span')
[22:38:44] <AcidBeard> rfc19:^
[22:40:05] <rfc19> AcidBeard: Thanks, addClass seems to work, but not remove class -- ('#sec1-menu').children('span').removeClass('active');
[22:40:45] <rfc19> I guess it's two levels in: <ul id="sec1-menu"><li class="item"><span>about</span></li></ul>
[22:41:29] <alaing> rfc19: sorry could you post the addClass statement?
[22:41:37] <rfc19> I just did a double .children and it worked
[22:41:55] <rfc19> Let me get a fiddle up
[22:41:58] <AcidBeard> ...seems kinda heavy
[22:42:00] <alaing> It might be better to use this
[22:42:19] <alaing> $('#sec1-menu').find('span')
[22:42:37] <alaing> that will search for span's within the ul
[22:43:10] <alaing> then you not getting query to look within all the li to the look for spans within each one of those li
[22:43:14] <alaing> much lighter
[22:43:32] <rfc19> alaing: that worked.. thanks :)
[22:44:27] <alaing> the reason .children('span') didn't work was because it was looking for something like <ul><span></span></ul> which is obviously invalid syntax
[22:44:41] <alaing> you cant have a span as a child of UL
[22:44:53] <alaing> only li elements
[22:45:00] <rfc19> alaing: understood, thank you. .children('li').children('span') worked though :)
[22:45:03] <rfc19> very messy
[22:45:05] <rfc19> but worked
[22:45:33] <alaing> I hope you caching your selectors too
[22:45:49] <alaing> if you need them more than once
[22:46:08] <acidjazz> yea always cache
[22:46:32] <alaing> you can also use .end() to go back to the ul quickly
[22:46:48] <rfc19> sorry, I'm new to Jquery, what would caching achieve and how do i do it?
[22:46:58] <rfc19> Happy to read an article if it's a lot of explaining
[22:47:14] <alaing> rfc19 theres loads about caching selectors
[22:48:00] <alaing> eg var $myMenu = $('#sec1-menu')
[22:48:17] <alaing> var $mySpan = $myMenu.find('span')
[22:48:27] <alaing> then I can use something like
[22:48:43] <alaing> $mySpan.addClass('something');
[22:48:55] <alaing> $mySpan.removeClass('something')
[22:49:31] <acidjazz> alaing: i use some code ive written to help w/ basically all of that
[22:49:31] <acidjazz> here
[22:49:46] <acidjazz> alaing: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8c13d937d40fae1f88dc
[22:49:51] <acidjazz> _.on and _.off
[22:49:59] <acidjazz> you pass selectors as many as you want
[22:50:04] <acidjazz> and they add/remove on and off classes
[22:50:17] <alaing> because if each time you have to call $('#sec1-menu').find('span') it has to go through the dom and search for all those each time
[22:50:33] <acidjazz> so _.on('.menu > .item'); will $('.menu > .item').removeClass('off').addClass('on'); etc
[22:50:56] <acidjazz> alaing: true but the dom FROM #sec1-menu, not the entire document
[22:51:06] <al-damiri> How can I validate input fields inside a table?
[22:51:10] <al-damiri> Are there any examples?
[22:51:35] <al-damiri> Like I have two input fields per row, one is required, other is not.
[22:51:36] <acidjazz> id ultimately validate server-side but you can do some js/jquery regex to make it quicker alaing
[22:51:47] <alaing> acidjazz: yes thats right it would only search from the ul but the point is it would still be slower than cache it
[22:52:00] <al-damiri> If the optional one is having a value, it should not validate unless the mandatory field is also provided a value etc.
[22:52:45] <acidjazz> alaing: therse are a ton of libs
[22:53:51] <AcidBeard> al-damiri: Are you just wanting to make sure the in[put has data before submitting?
[22:55:07] <acidjazz> s/alaing/al-damiri
[22:55:42] <alaing> lol
[22:56:06] <alaing> i figured you were responding to al-damiri
[22:56:25] <al-damiri> AcidBeard: There are two fields, one mandatory with a condition and the second optional.
[22:56:47] <al-damiri> The condition for the first one will be like if the optional field has any value, the mandatory one must also be provided one.
[22:57:10] <al-damiri> Any other rows having both fields blank shouldn't be required etc.
[22:57:26] <al-damiri> I can roll out the validation myself in JS, but I think there is a better and easier way?
[22:58:31] <alaing> rfc19: check out https://vimeo.com/12529436
[22:58:43] <alaing> fast forwd to around 33:25
[22:58:59] <alaing> Paul Irish talks about selector performance
[23:04:17] <AcidBeard> al-damirir: Something like this maybe? http://pastebin.com/kD7iG7wy
[23:04:58] <AcidBeard> But as acidjazz said, validate serverside as well
[23:07:27] <al-damiri> AcidBeard: Seems that would do. Let me try it.
[23:07:33] <al-damiri> AcidBeard: Yes we do check server-side.
[23:08:11] <AcidBeard> I am so damn pleased with this so far: http://rpgsys.aramisblack.com/
[23:10:57] <acidjazz> makin a web rpg?
[23:11:15] <AcidBeard> Yar
[23:11:20] <acidjazz> nice
[23:11:22] <acidjazz> did you see that mozilla one
[23:11:26] <AcidBeard> Nope

[23:11:51] <acidjazz> these french guys
[23:11:55] <acidjazz> little workshop
[23:11:57] <acidjazz> crazy good work
[23:13:01] <AcidBeard> Whoah, that's pretty awesome.
[23:13:16] <AcidBeard> I'm trying to make something like Eclipse
[23:13:23] <acidjazz> url that
[23:14:24] <AcidBeard> http://www.eclipseorigins.com/portal.php
[23:14:37] <AcidBeard> It's a 2D (mmo)RPG maker
[23:14:56] <AcidBeard> But it all requires installs and such
[23:14:58] <acidjazz> oh so you're making your own engine
[23:15:00] <acidjazz> cool
[23:15:02] <AcidBeard> Yeah
[23:15:50] <AcidBeard> I'm actually using their tilesets for now.  Don't think I can legally do that so I'll probably end up having to make my own before I release it
[23:17:19] <AcidBeard> I'm thinking of making combat turnbased
[23:18:15] <AcidBeard> Because PHP is the backend and I can't see realtime combat going very well
[23:18:20] <coldhead> eh, just change the colours a bit
[23:18:27] <coldhead> no one will know
[23:18:38] <AcidBeard> Yeah, I could just change the colors and move the tiles arouns
[23:18:41] <AcidBeard> around*
[23:20:02] <AcidBeard> Movement on the map will be controlled via Arrow keys and I am thinking of making an on-screen d-pad for touch devices
[23:27:19] <simpy> how to generrate the ics file on the click of google using icalendar
[23:34:08] <TheHackOps> Has anyone ever seen X[g].exec is not a function
[23:34:17] <TheHackOps> Just upgraded to 1.11
[23:34:19] <TheHackOps> .3
[23:50:52] <al-damiri> Hi #jquery.
[23:51:21] <al-damiri> I have an input field and when I do $(this).val() it returns an empty string, even though there is a value entered in the field.
[23:51:43] <TheHackOps> What is this
[23:51:45] <TheHackOps> in context
[23:51:56] <al-damiri> The <input type="number" />
[23:52:00] <TheHackOps> No
[23:52:02] <TheHackOps> What is this
[23:52:09] <TheHackOps> Show more code
[23:52:13] <al-damiri> the <input /> element
[23:52:22] <TheHackOps> this is a contextule thing
[23:52:41] <al-damiri> TheHackOps: What I found was that if I enter any number, .val() returns the number.
[23:52:52] <al-damiri> TheHackOps: But if I enter an alphabet it returns empty string.
[23:52:55] <TheHackOps> Yes
[23:52:58] <TheHackOps> Thats your browser
[23:53:07] <TheHackOps> Not allowing for bad input
[23:53:13] <al-damiri> TheHackOps: How can I get the value even if bad input?
[23:53:21] <TheHackOps> dont use number
[23:53:45] <al-damiri> TheHackOps: I see.
[23:53:48] <al-damiri> Thanks.
[23:54:31] <al-damiri> TheHackOps: Can I do a manual checkValidity() of all <input /> elements in a table without a <form />
[23:54:34] <al-damiri> ?
[23:54:55] <TheHackOps> yes
[23:55:25] <al-damiri> TheHackOps: How?
[23:55:33] <al-damiri> TheHackOps: Like in just one call?
[23:55:55] <al-damiri> $('input').checkValidity() (I think checkValidity isn't a jQuery method right?)
[23:57:01] <TheHackOps> You would have to write a method
[23:57:10] <TheHackOps> and each over the top of your input
[23:57:11] <TheHackOps> s
[23:57:38] <al-damiri> TheHackOps: Hmmm. That's fine enough. :)
