[05:36:08] <mkwst> mikesherov: ping. I'm talking with some folks at jQuery EU about bugs in WebKit. They're mostly telling me to talk to you. :)
[05:36:18] <mkwst> mikesherov: when you're around, we should chat.
[05:37:12] <tallio> could somone help me formalizing my code ? i would like to make somethin simple : load few divs with text, all displayed none, then make a jquery function to animte all by making first appear, stay a while, disappear, then show the next one, and again and again until the last then restart. My objectiv is to understand animation in jquery i am a noob
[05:45:50] <mikesherov> mkwst: hey
[05:45:53] <mikesherov> I just saw this
[05:45:54] <mikesherov> https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110007
[05:46:10] <mikesherov> btw, scott_gonzalez rwaldron DaveMethvin|away I'm back
[05:46:19] <mikesherov> I had to focus on work like a madman for a while
[05:46:20] <scott_gonzalez> HOORAY!
[05:46:48] <scott_gonzalez> tallio: Support is in #jquery.
[05:46:58] <mikesherov> I'm super psyched about https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110007 mkwst 
[05:47:32] <mkwst> mikesherov: great! :)
[05:47:55] <mkwst> the goal is to gather up the bugs you folks are working around in the hopes of making them visible.
[05:48:00] <mikesherov> I have a company hackathon today, so I can spend all day talking about it mkwst 
[05:48:00] <mikesherov> Yes
[05:48:01] <mikesherov> I see
[05:48:19] <mkwst> and if i can fix some along the way, great. :)
[05:48:37] <gnarf> mikesherov: hey
[05:48:51] <mikesherov> I'll be back in 45 minutes. I'm on my way into work
[05:49:19] <mkwst> no worries. i'm at jquery eu, so i might or might not be online.
[05:49:27] <mkwst> but we should chat whenever we're both online. :)
[05:49:49] <mikesherov> k
[05:49:54] <mikesherov> hey gnarf 
[05:50:12] <gnarf> mikesherov: yeah, i was gonna tell you that you should talk with mkwst - ;)
[05:50:18] <mikesherov> ha
[05:50:37] <mikesherov> My inbox blew up this morning with all the jQuery webkit tickets I was tracking
[05:50:49] <mikesherov> all got this mysterious "blocks 110007" added
[05:50:56] <mikesherov> I knew something was up
[05:51:18] <mkwst> :)
[05:51:53] <mkwst> if there are more bugs that i haven't linked up to 110007, please do let me know.
[06:47:08] <mikesherov> mkwst: back
[06:48:05] <mikesherov> one thing besides all of those tickets, which is great, is: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013Jan/0492.html
[06:48:44] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: Now I feel mean :-/ http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13498
[06:53:02] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez I'm used to it
[06:54:56] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez we should distill your response and create a "New Features In jQuery" document
[06:55:27] <rwaldron> where we document the common response that feature requests will most often receive
[07:14:28] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.
[07:34:20] <scott_gonzalez> How am I just now learning about `git stash -u`?
[07:35:50] <petersendidit> because you used gists as your stash for to long? ;-)
[07:36:05] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, that could be it.
[07:36:22] <scott_gonzalez> gists are like distributed stashes :-P
[07:36:46] <scott_gonzalez> I should alias git dstash to git gist-diff...
[07:37:33] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, that reminds me of another alias I made: git save.
[07:37:56] <scott_gonzalez> I tend to make aliases for tasks that I think I should do often and then forget that I created the alias.
[07:38:01] <scott_gonzalez> So I never use them :-/
[07:38:20] <scott_gonzalez> save creates a stash, but keeps the changes in your checkout as well.
[07:38:33] <scott_gonzalez> Though I guess that's what staging is for.
[07:38:38] <petersendidit> yea
[07:38:51] <scott_gonzalez> This is what happens when you use git incorrectly.
[07:39:12] <petersendidit> when you use git as svn
[08:27:17] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!

[11:11:07] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: What did my RSS reader just notify me about? jQuery intercourse?
[11:11:09] <Krinkle> >>>>>
[11:12:55] <Krinkle> Anyway, awesome progress. This is huge.
[11:14:10] <Krinkle> Oh my, that song is going to get stuck in my head for a while
[11:14:16] <Krinkle> http://try.jquery.com/levels/1/challenges/2
[11:51:49] <ajpiano> haha Krinkle
[12:18:55] <mikesherov> mkwst: here?
[12:19:01] <mikesherov> Saw you added my stuff
[12:19:16] <mikesherov> I'm just going to keep adding comments when I come across them
[12:19:25] <mikesherov> Thanks so much for creating that meta ticket
[14:11:48] <gnarf> mikesherov: mkwst is prolly sleeping
[14:11:50] <gnarf> i should be too
[14:11:52] <gnarf> ;)
[14:12:22] <kswedberg> gnarf: I just PMed you. :)
[14:12:59] <DaveMethvin> this timezone stuff has got to stop!
[14:21:24] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i'll set my clocks to GMT if you will
[14:21:25] <gnarf> ;)
[14:22:01] <DaveMethvin> sounds like a game of timezone chicken
[14:49:43] <therealklanni> Would someone please explain line 612 in core.js?
[14:50:59] <DaveMethvin> therealklanni we needed something to put between line 611 and 613
[14:51:06] <DaveMethvin> link? /lazy
[14:51:16] <therealklanni> It's the merge method, it does a conditional check for the .length property of the array being a number... I'm wondering what in what cases the length property would ever not be a numerical value
[14:51:20] <therealklanni> har har ;)
[14:51:23] <therealklanni> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js
[14:52:31] <therealklanni> Just trying to understand exactly what purpose the check serves and what it accomplishes overall
[14:56:38] <DaveMethvin> i *think* that's for oldIE but i can't recall therealklanni
[14:59:17] <therealklanni> Hmm, so it's a check because old IE would sometimes have a fucked up .length prop?
[14:59:52] <therealklanni> You think, anyway
[15:01:11] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[15:02:36] <gibson042> DaveMethvin is right
[15:03:15] <gibson042> if a NodeList contains an element with id or name "length", then oldIE will give you a ref to that element when you query the length property
[15:03:49] <DaveMethvin> right, like form collections
[15:04:52] <gibson042> form collections are by far the worst because of per-spec aliasing, but even getElementsByTagName exhibit the nonsense IIRC
[15:05:47] <gibson042> (in oldIE, that is)
[15:12:04] <therealklanni> gibson042: if I want to remove that (not support older IE) which part would I take out?
[15:12:36] <therealklanni> the "else" section, amirite?
[15:13:03] <gibson042> well, I'm pretty sure you would also lose support for form collections
[15:13:09] <gibson042> but yes
[15:13:59] <therealklanni> That's fine with me, I was just basing a variant of this merge method on that code
[15:14:21] <therealklanni> So I'm not actually modifying jQuery or overriding it there, it's a separate function
[15:14:50] <therealklanni> Something I'm using strictly for arrays, not jQuery objects
[15:14:56] <therealklanni> So I should be fine
[15:15:23] <gibson042> if you have an array, you can just `push.apply( target, contents )`
[15:15:34] <gibson042> Array.prototype.push, that is
[15:16:00] <therealklanni> Well I'm merging multiple arrays
[15:19:06] <therealklanni> Hmm yeah that could work
[15:19:26] <therealklanni> I guess the only reason jQuery uses such a complex method is due to IE.. :/
[15:27:28] <gibson042> that's certainly why it looks the way it does now
[15:29:02] <gnarf> um
[15:29:05] <gnarf> concat?
[15:29:15] <gnarf> why push apply instead of concat
[15:34:03] <therealklanni> Yeah I was thinking that myself
[15:43:44] <gibson042> probably only if the target is also an array
[15:43:57] <gibson042> guess I should've asked about that
