[14:27:15] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone know of a free service that has a JSONP API?
[14:27:34] <scott_gonzalez> We've been using geobytes.com for one of the jQuery UI demos, but it doesn't support HTTPS.
[14:27:41] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: twitter did at one time
[14:28:00] <DaveMethvin> https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/search/tweets
[14:29:16] <scott_gonzalez> requires authentication :-(
[14:29:33] <DaveMethvin> really? the example worked for me
[14:29:37] <DaveMethvin> https://api.twitter.com/1.1/search/tweets.json?q=%23freebandnames&since_id=24012619984051000&max_id=250126199840518145&result_type=mixed&count=4
[14:29:59] <DaveMethvin> probably super rate limited tho
[14:30:09] <scott_gonzalez> I get a "Bad Authentication data" error.
[14:30:18] <scott_gonzalez> The docs say it's rate limited and requires authentication.
[14:30:38] <DaveMethvin> huh, i put it into a tab and it returned json
[14:38:11] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, this would be perfect for an autocomplete source :-P http://www.setgetgo.com/randomword/get.php?callback=foo
