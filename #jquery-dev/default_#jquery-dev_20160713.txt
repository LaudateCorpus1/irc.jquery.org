[08:53:54] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ping
[08:53:59] <DaveMethvin> hey m_gol 
[08:54:12] <m_gol> hi. have you seen my question?
[08:54:21] <DaveMethvin> which one?
[08:54:28] <m_gol> [10:58:06]  <m_gol>	DaveMethvin|away: why is the v3.0.5 tag missing in the jqiery.com repo? That's the one you committed
[08:54:43] <DaveMethvin> oh
[08:54:53] <m_gol> I was actually surprised to see that the page built
[08:55:03] <m_gol> I thought it looks at the tags and now I'm confused
[08:55:05] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, there was some problem with the servers and that must have been a result
[08:55:43] <jqcommit> [13jquery.com] 15dmethvin tagged 06v3.0.5 at 14409db15: 02https://git.io/vK8sl
[08:55:44] <m_gol> ok, I'll add the tag
[08:55:52] <m_gol> oh, you already had, great :)
[08:56:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah i just re-pushed it
[08:56:12] <DaveMethvin> really strange
[08:56:24] <m_gol> I was looking at the upgrade guide & created some API issues, we're still missing some necessary updates
[08:56:35] <DaveMethvin> yep, thanks
[08:56:40] <m_gol> but I haven't had time to look through the whole list, I'll get back to it later
[08:56:54] <m_gol> in any case, we seem to lack manpower in the api repo
[08:57:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah, in the past I've done a bunch at once, but i am flying blind because i can't build on windows
[08:57:23] <m_gol> maybe we should hold off with releasing lots of changes until we deal with it a little ;)
[08:57:36] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: but the API setup uses vagrant :)
[08:57:46] <DaveMethvin> yep and i've had problems with it
[08:57:50] <m_gol> ah, ok
[08:57:57] <DaveMethvin> downloaded the whole vm several times and gotten errors
[08:58:22] <m_gol> errors in firing it up?
[08:58:26] <DaveMethvin> it could just be my machine, but eveything else works fine
[08:58:30] <DaveMethvin> random failures
[08:58:45] <DaveMethvin> i think you deployed new jquery versions in the past when my setup was acting up
[08:58:46] <m_gol> but at which phase?
[08:58:56] <DaveMethvin> different places
[08:59:01] <DaveMethvin> sometimes right after download
[08:59:12] <DaveMethvin> other times, i am in the shell and start getting strange errors
[08:59:16] <DaveMethvin> like missing files
[08:59:21] <DaveMethvin> when they're not missing
[08:59:59] <m_gol> I usually fire it up and forget, doing everything from my machine and just depending on the vagrant one to have all connections, databases etc. being set up properly. If the host machine is not up to the task you can always `vagrant ssh` and do everything from inside the machine.
[09:00:09] <m_gol> But if files are missing etc., that seems like a bigger issue
[09:00:44] <DaveMethvin> every year or so i try it again and run into different problems
[09:00:50] <DaveMethvin> for like, 6 years straight
[09:00:51] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:01:02] <m_gol> haha

[10:37:15] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: are you there?
[10:38:19] <m_gol> or timmywil
[11:05:10] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: here
[11:09:47] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: what do we do with PRs requiring a minor bump when we're planning a patch release before that? I guess we shouldn't merge them...
[11:10:07] <DaveMethvin> or we could go straight to minor
[11:10:27] <DaveMethvin> but yeah for now i would not merge until we decide
[11:14:20] <m_gol> k
[11:14:31] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: it seems we're up to milestone juggling
[11:15:19] <DaveMethvin> i'd rather avoid a patch release if we know we want a minor, but let's see what timmywil says
[11:15:23] <m_gol> every decision to release the minor instead of the patch pushes the stuff already merged to the minor so the milestone has to be changed, the other things targetted at the same patch milestone moved to the next patch etc.
[11:15:44] <DaveMethvin> a release is a lot of detail work for both us and the consumers
[11:15:54] <DaveMethvin> so lots of releases are a pain for everyone
[11:15:59] <m_gol> yeah, I just wonder if there's a better way
[11:16:27] <DaveMethvin> considering we just put out a major there are bound to be changes of both kinds for a little while
[11:37:50] <timmywil> m_gol, DaveMethvin: it depends on the issue
[11:38:15] <timmywil> priority dictates whether we release another minor before a patch
[11:38:34] <timmywil> but we have lots of issues for 3.1.1. I'd like to get those done.
[11:38:56] <m_gol> timmywil: we have a couple deprecation PRs scheduled for a minor, I was thinking we should wait with merging them all since we want 3.1.1
[11:39:23] <timmywil> correct. those should not be merged yet. and I wouldn't say they are pressing.
[11:39:49] <timmywil> I'm more concerned about the bugs that need fixing.
[11:42:28] <m_gol> timmywil: Agreed. We should probably say that to the whole team as so far we've only been cautious about merging breaking changes and now there are more kinds of PRs that we need to be careful with
[11:42:47] <timmywil> perhaps a do not merge label?

[12:00:59] <timmywil> or maybe just set milestones on the PRs, with the team understanding that PRs set to later milestones cannot be landed.
[12:03:40] <m_gol> timmywil: that might be a good idea. It's easy to overlook forget about the problem & merge the PR it since it has no milestone

[16:21:28] <timmywil> lol
[16:22:10] <snover> did he hire a botfarm to give that over 10,000 stars or what
[16:22:18] <snover> i just don‚Äôt get it
[16:22:52] <DaveMethvin> wow, didn't notice that
[16:25:05] <robertmaxrees> well you see jquery is too big and
[16:25:16] <timmywil> ha
[16:25:56] <robertmaxrees> wait, uhm.,  oh i don't need to support old ie and.  wait.
[16:44:41] <s5fs> snover: actually thats an interesting question
[16:45:26] <s5fs> so I dug into the stargazers a bit and its crazy how many of them are zero commit history, boatloads of stars and maaaybe a handful of repos, most of them forked or originals w/no original commits
[16:48:26] <s5fs> I assume that's true on several projects, not just zepto, but it's still interesting.
[16:50:54] <DaveMethvin> s5fs: I suspect all it takes is a mention on Hacker News or something like that
