[08:33:43] <JamesMGreene> leobalter: jzaefferer tells me you're going to start working for Bocoup in the fall?
[08:34:07] <leobalter> it's not public yet, but it's true :)
[08:34:14] <JamesMGreene> Whoooooops, public now >_>
[08:34:17] <leobalter> hehehhe
[08:34:39] <JamesMGreene> Well, sorry about that. That's exciting, though, congrats!
[08:34:47] <leobalter> considering the chat log stays public, there's no way to hide this now :)
[08:34:54] <leobalter> ty
[08:35:04] <JamesMGreene> We could probably have it manually edited but yeah ;)
[08:35:18] <leobalter> I'm just waiting the visa, it takes about 6 months 
[08:35:31] <JamesMGreene> Wow, that is shockingly slow
[08:35:35] <JamesMGreene> Yay America
[08:36:43] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer Krinkle scott_gonzalez: Ping ping ping
[08:36:47] <Krinkle> Hi
[08:36:58] <JamesMGreene> Hallo
[08:36:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'm here.
[08:37:22] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer: ??? :)
[08:37:47] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think he's around.
[08:37:57] <jzaefferer> Hey, thanks JamesMGreene for the reminder
[08:37:59] <scott_gonzalez> He told me yesterday that he was going to miss a different meeting.
[08:38:06] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, look he is here :-)
[08:38:09] <JamesMGreene> I think I got him via GChat :)
[08:38:25] <JamesMGreene> Anyway, to #jquery-meeting?
[08:50:41] <gnarf> leobalter: is there a corresponding pull on api.qunitjs.com for the redirects?
[08:58:47] <leobalter> https://github.com/jquery/api.qunitjs.com/pull/49 
[08:59:00] <leobalter> @gnarf: this one
[09:33:59] <chriys> hey guys I'm looking to get some certifications in web design HTML5, JQUERY and PHP. do you some free of them or the cheaper one?
[09:37:44] <scott_gonzalez> chriys: This channel is only for discussion about development of jQuery.
[09:38:47] <chriys> Oh ok sorry
[09:49:39] <jzaefferer> leobalter: I guess I should land your PR along with the infrastructure change, and then we'll do the same thing again after a new QUnit release is out with assert.expect?
[10:03:41] <Krinkle> mikesherov: I'm trying to test the wikimedia preset. Not sure how to.
[10:04:00] <Krinkle> Firstly, Im confused at not getting an error when specifying "preset": "wikimedia" on an existing install
[10:04:03] <Krinkle> that preset doesn't exist
[10:04:08] <Krinkle> it just silently passes using the defaults presumably
[10:04:27] <Krinkle> (via grunt-jscs-checker, but running the jscs cli directly passes as well)
[10:09:59] <Krinkle> mikesherov: either way, I verified it is actually being used by tmeporarily changing wikimedia.json  to have a rule we're violating.
[10:10:01] <Krinkle> :)
[10:18:22] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Yeah, I've raised it on my list (it sank down). I need to refamiliarise myself with it, but shouldn't be hard (node-testswam reruns)
[10:20:36] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: Thanks. I'll try to help as much as I can, once you've dug up a more limited problem
[10:23:37] <jzaefferer> leobalter: http://api.qunitjs.com/module
[10:23:51] <jzaefferer> leobalter: thanks for the PR :-)
[10:53:02] <leobalter> jzaefferer: I'm back from lunch. Great to see it landed. 
[11:37:13] <JamesMGreene> ajpiano et al: Have all of the speakers for Chicago been notified?
[11:37:20] <ajpiano> no, not yet
[11:37:21] <ajpiano> only some
[11:37:29] <JamesMGreene> Still selecting?
[11:38:06] <JamesMGreene> nm, that was a [mostly] dumb follow-up question
[11:38:14] <JamesMGreene> since I doubt we're telling them in rounds ;)
[11:39:05] <ajpiano> yup
[13:03:37] <Krinkle> markelog: Hi, I noticed earlier when testing preset:wikimedia, there is no error when using a preset that doesn't exist
[13:03:39] <Krinkle> is this a bug?
[13:04:11] <Krinkle> It looked like it was passing, but really I was using an older version that didn't have the preset yet and it just used the defaults (so basically nothing)
[13:04:46] <markelog> Krinkle: did you use cli command?
[13:06:20] <markelog> yeah, we should notify user about this, could you create an issue?
[13:06:50] <Krinkle> OK
[14:56:18] <mikesherov_> scott_gonzalez: thoughts on https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/issues/79
