[17:41:03] <snover> i wish you guys called ‚Äújquery compat‚Äù ‚Äújquery geezer edition‚Äù :)
[17:42:03] <snover> cc DaveMethvin
[17:42:13] <snover> IT‚ÄôS NOT TOO LATE GUYS
[17:42:14] <DaveMethvin> lol
[17:42:58] <snover> https://www.npmjs.org/package/intern-geezer there‚Äôs precedence for it
[17:43:46] <DaveMethvin> well you named jquery-migrate and that went really well
[17:44:12] <snover> EXTRA PRECEDENCE
[17:45:06] <DaveMethvin> we came close to naming that compat, which would have been sub-optimal 
[17:45:22] <DaveMethvin> jquery why are you using this one edition
[17:45:42] <snover> i‚Äôll save you from naming things ‚Äúcompat‚Äù twice in a row
[17:45:49] <snover> once more and i think i get a free hat?
[17:47:39] <snover> interestingly enough, intern-geezer is downloaded less than 1/10th as much as regular intern
[17:48:14] <snover> that actually wasn‚Äôt an interesting fact at all, sorry guys
[17:49:30] <DaveMethvin> well it helps if you call it a name like that
[17:49:47] <DaveMethvin> if it were intern-ebola i'm sure the downloads would be even smaller
[17:50:23] <snover> it doesn‚Äôt seem to prevent a ton of corporations from adopting it
[17:50:56] <DaveMethvin> why just yesterday hackers installed it on every sony desktop pc
[17:52:17] <DaveMethvin> looking fwd to seeing intern set up on the ptr events
[17:52:26] <DaveMethvin> supposedly we're getting close with google
[17:52:39] <snover> did you see that i ported qunit to an intern interface? :P
[17:52:50] <DaveMethvin> yeah i saw that go by
[17:52:53] <DaveMethvin> didn't look at it tho
[17:53:01] <DaveMethvin> i need another 48 hrs per day
[17:53:33] <snover> i think i have thought of a good way to do the assert-fail-and-continue stuff, right now it just stops on the first assertion failure like everything else
[17:53:57] <snover> but since the assertions go through a separate api i can just capture the errors and stitch them all together
[17:54:46] <snover> really i just want the 3000 stars. it‚Äôsa me, mario!
[17:57:33] <DaveMethvin> Go paste this in Github :star2: 
[17:57:35] <DaveMethvin> :O
[17:59:29] <snover> üåü
[18:00:45] <snover> i‚Äôll be back later
[18:00:48] <DaveMethvin> looks like i need a better irc client http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/a6d36f.png
[18:00:56] <DaveMethvin> i probably won't :)
[18:01:34] <snover> in that case, goodbye FOREVER
