[19:03:32] <bot-t> (37 hours 10 mins ago) <scott_gonzalez> tell DaveMethvin trac-o-bot still uses invalid resolutions.
[19:03:36] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin
[19:03:46] <DaveMethvin> yep
[19:03:51] <mikesherov> this fail makes no sense: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/923
[19:04:03] <DaveMethvin> the attr one?
[19:04:08] <mikesherov> yeah
[19:04:09] <mikesherov> http://swarm.jquery.org/result/278439
[19:04:20] <mikesherov> it's failing because 1 != "1"
[19:04:29] <mikesherov> although, 1 DOES == "1"
[19:06:13] <mikesherov> I can't repro in chrome 20 either
[19:07:18] <DaveMethvin> sense. it makes none
[19:07:52] <mikesherov> OK then
[19:08:08] <mikesherov> I updated the other PR and I answered your questions about the SVG test
[19:08:21] <mikesherov> I g2g, please let me know if there's anything else you need

[19:58:45] <DaveMethvin> i see no failures
[20:07:15] <snover> hi DaveMethvin
[20:07:16] <snover> hapy sunday
[20:07:24] <DaveMethvin> hey snover
[20:07:33] <snover> how’s life?
[20:07:44] <snover> was quitting the best thing you ever did?
[20:07:50] <DaveMethvin> well if i could get testswarm to agree my code was good ...
[20:08:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's been fun
[20:08:25] <snover> i’m sorry to hear about your code troubles
[20:08:30] <snover> maybe if you delete the tests it will work better?
[20:08:40] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, not a bad idea
[20:08:49] <DaveMethvin> a lot less to maintain as well
[20:09:01] <snover> exactly my thoughts
[20:09:27] <Krinkle> or turn jquery into semicolon-2.0.js
[20:09:39] <Krinkle> would greatly improve our cross-browser compatibility
[20:09:42] <Krinkle> and simplify the unit tests a lot
[20:10:14] <DaveMethvin> our new style guide eliminates braces and uses the comma operator whenever possible
[20:10:30] <snover> sounds very es6-y
[20:10:40] <DaveMethvin> of course we still want readability, so lines wrap at 256 chars
[20:12:37] <snover> if you add a transpiler and change the method call signature to look like obj-c “message passing” that would probably help readability too
[20:13:42] <DaveMethvin> i have a great syntax, ~> and a nickname of "bent arrow operator" but i can't figure out a good set of semantics for it
[20:15:16] <snover> probably something to do with regular expressions
[20:20:13] <DaveMethvin> now i have two problems
[20:21:07] <snover> we should give up on software engineering and become a comedy duo
[20:21:21] <DaveMethvin> nobody would understand but other software people
[20:22:31] <snover> i’m not even sure most software people would understand
[20:22:43] <DaveMethvin> lots of inside jokes
[20:22:51] <snover> well it’s kind of a wasteland out there
[20:23:13] <DaveMethvin> when i look at the things reported in our bug tracker, i think
[20:23:23] <DaveMethvin> "are these the people writing software today?"
[20:23:41] <DaveMethvin> scary
[20:26:17] <snover> We have a client that is a big .NET shop that have written 100k LOC to do things the way you would do things if JavaScript were C#/.NET. But it isn’t, so it’s a disaster on so many levels.
[20:26:34] <snover> I have a voicemail from them sitting in my inbox right now :(
[20:27:18] <DaveMethvin> Help us snovy-wan kenobe, you're our only hope
[20:28:34] <snover> It might come as a shock to you (but probably not) that their application performance is not so good.
[20:28:59] <DaveMethvin> Nothing that a good delete key can't fix
[20:31:47] <snover> As part of a massive performance analysis I told them that constantly deep cloning objects that are not modified was not a good idea from a performance perspective
[20:32:12] <snover> and apparently their takeaway was that this is why their application has Ajax requests that get stuck in “wait”
[20:32:19] <snover> even though I explained to them why that was happening
[20:32:23] <snover> twice
[20:32:25] <DaveMethvin> lol
[20:32:37] <snover> so that is what the voicemail is about
[20:32:47] <DaveMethvin> maybe the THIRD time's the charm
[20:33:02] <snover> they commented out dojo.clone calls and the Ajax requests are still in “wait”
[20:33:13] <snover> sigh
[20:33:14] <snover> india
[20:36:27] <DaveMethvin> this sounds a lot like an html game i was looking at a few weeks ago, they were using john's "classical inheritance" code which does a ton of copying
[20:36:56] <snover> sweeeet.
[21:16:41] <BalmTiger> helloooo
