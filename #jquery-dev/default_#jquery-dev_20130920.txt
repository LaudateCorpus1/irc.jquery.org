[06:03:21] <DaveMethvin> Ancient we could definitely use some automated way to ensure we don't regress
[08:27:19] <gibson042> an old body exhumed by zepto: https://github.com/madrobby/zepto/pull/817#issuecomment-24787250 (cf. https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/fb0f2952929fbe0e8a39da8c7865a397c7e74835)
[08:27:20] <b-ot> gibson042: Pull request #817 by charsleysa (3d 1h ago): Prototype Patch
[08:28:03] <Ancient> DaveMethvin, Well my starting point would probably be repairing the XHTML portion of the jQuery Test Suite, it's been broken for a while and regressions have been piling up there for ages now.
[08:28:38] <Ancient> What's the current state of the test suite these days anyways?
[08:30:32] <Ancient> Every time I've run the test suite over the past couple years I've seen failures in the latest support browsers
[08:31:23] <DaveMethvin> Ancient we are passing all tests in the unit test suite. http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jquery If you'd like to suggest a way to test XHTML that would be great. I'd prefer to avoid running the whole suite over again in XHTML or trying to always run XHTML since not all browsers support it and valid XHTML pages are rare
[08:31:39] <gibson042> see ?10198
[08:31:48] <gibson042> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10198
[08:33:44] <DaveMethvin> Ancient are you up to try the suggestion here? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/c6a694e1c262acb941b7fd86663f186656496bbc#commitcomment-2975194
[08:33:44] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: Richard Gibson (5mon 1w ago): Fix #13754: Require element.style for support tests
[08:34:21] <DaveMethvin> i am pretty sure there is/was a Firefox bug related to transformed XML docs where the document type was wrong though
[08:35:05] <Ancient> gibson042, Yeah I recall that ticket, it was created as a result of one of my previous regression finds with XHTML I believe.
[08:35:34] <gnarf> no idea what woke up this pull request: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1019#issuecomment-10122288 but omg that was an insane bug - rememeber that one DaveMethvin ?
[08:35:34] <b-ot> gnarf: Pull request #1019 by lukemelia (10mon 2w ago): Works around a crashing browser bug affecting Android browser 2.3.x on some devices
[08:36:22] <DaveMethvin> yes gnarf and i was hoping to just ignore that :)
[08:37:05] <Ancient> So you're thinking just make sure the basics work in XHTML? If so, as long as we have some way to set http headers on specific iframes, I can get a test working to catch the brunt of the regressions
[08:38:03] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Migrate Core 1.x build #109: STILL FAILING in 2 min 32 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Migrate%20Core%201.x/109/
[08:38:21] <Ancient> The majority of the issues over the years have been with feature / bug detects, so all that used to be necessary was to make sure we could get a working jQuery. But I understand you're now doing feature detects as things are used?
[08:39:37] <Ancient> It makes a lot of sense from a performance perspective, but it means we need to invoke every path that could run a feature / bug test now
[08:39:46] <DaveMethvin> Ancient yes, so hmmm, seems like we'd need to run at least some subset of the unit tests to ensure the feature detects ran
[08:40:03] <Ancient> Precisely
[08:42:04] <DaveMethvin> this is why i really dislike XHTML, but i totally understand this shouldn't break so i'll spare everyone the tirade
[08:43:11] <Ancient> Yeah, everyone has their preferences mine just trend towards strict subsets
[08:45:06] <DaveMethvin> but the invitation to create a solution still stands Ancient :)
[08:45:56] <snover> if something ‚Äúlax‚Äù can be interpreted as well as something that is ‚Äústrict‚Äù, then why bother being strict?
[08:46:45] <Ancient> snover, Because I've seen human error end up causing enough subtle bugs in my life, and sunk too many hours into resolving them
[08:47:22] <DaveMethvin> snover, because the 99% of the people who use the XHTML doctype but don't validate feel better about themselves :)
[08:47:47] <snover> yeah‚Ä¶i was going to say, you can still lint your code and validate your markup‚Ä¶
[08:49:41] <Ancient> Yes, and what happens when your lint tool is wrong? Similar to how you don't trust a single precaution as a security measure, you shouldn't take a single precaution to ensure the validity of everything you do.
[08:50:22] <Ancient> DaveMethvin, I'm still brainstorming potential solutions, but none of them are good yet.
[08:50:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's why the ticket has been open so long :)  but thanks for pointing out the problem, it definitely needs to be fixed
[08:52:10] <Ancient> It's easy to pinpoint each issue as it comes up in my environment, you only don't hear about it sooner because as you said 99% of XHTML doctypes aren't on XHTML documents.
[08:54:19] <Ancient> I'm going to have to think on it a lot though
[08:55:40] <Ancient> You don't want qUnit run 2 or more times (XHTML, CSP, etc.), which is understandable.
[08:55:59] <DaveMethvin> this is the bug I was thinking bout http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13193
[08:56:29] <DaveMethvin> Ancient perhaps we could run the tests less frequently in XHTML (weekly) just as a sanity check
[08:56:56] <Ancient> But we'll never create a sustainable solution if we try and keep a list of specific things that need to be invoked to test XHTML
[08:57:18] <Ancient> I mean the existing xhtml.php is seriously broken just because nobody considers it
[08:58:35] <Ancient> That bug is interesting, because XSLT isn't like HTML it all really.
[08:58:46] <Ancient> at all *
[08:59:23] <DaveMethvin> well once transformed, people expect it to work with jQuery. SURPRISE!
[08:59:57] <snover> i feel like i am ok in my position that people using xslt are just not right
[09:00:03] <snover> :
[09:00:05] <snover> )
[09:00:42] <DaveMethvin> the real die-hard XMLers seem to be into it, to me it just seems like an incredibly obtuse way to make a page
[09:01:04] <snover> but it‚Äôs a standard so you can switch your xslt engine and it still works!!!!
[09:01:22] <DaveMethvin> unless it's firefox
[09:01:36] <Ancient> To help it make a bit more sense, your backend outputs raw XML data, and then designers can create a webpage out of it. It's wonderful for that separation.
[09:01:55] <snover> having used xslt i feel like i can say it is wonderful for absolutely nothing
[09:02:04] <Ancient> Developers never actually have to touch any markup, at all, they don't even write the XML, they just pipe a database or ORM straight into a xml encoder and output it.
[09:02:07] <snover> unless you think going insane is wonderful
[09:02:10] <Ancient> That's the appeal to it
[09:02:26] <DaveMethvin> it's like taking the furniture out of a room through the keyhole
[09:02:28] <snover> xml is a great language to represent data in, what with its ability to represent common data types
[09:02:33] <snover> oh wait‚Ä¶
[09:02:47] <Ancient> Anyways, to get back onto the discussion at hand
[09:03:22] <Ancient> As much as I hate to admit it, it almost sounds like you should officially not support XHTML, XSLT, CSP and various other fancy features
[09:05:34] <Ancient> I mean, they're all centered around strict restrictions. jQuery doesn't really fit into strict restrictions with the goal of supporting everything.
[09:08:56] <Ancient> I mean, many of the those specific environments barely work as is. XHTML support is constantly adding bytes you've shaved back into the codebase. CSP breaks a solid number of documented functionality, but jQuery can be used under it provided it's used in very specific ways
[09:09:24] <Ancient> XSLT doesn't have a document in the same way a HTML page does
[09:12:15] <Ancient> I don't know how browsers deal with it, but the document sent over the network and the rendered DOM aren't anything alike.
[09:13:26] <Ancient> I guess it's a question of where do you draw the line
[09:14:02] <DaveMethvin> well this seems like mostly a limitation or inconvenience of testing, not implementation
[09:14:10] <DaveMethvin> and the fixes are easy
[09:15:04] <DaveMethvin> others like $(xml).data("abc", 1) are impossible to do cross browser because we can't add properties to xml nodes in oldIE
[09:15:10] <DaveMethvin> in those cases we just have to punt
[09:15:27] <DaveMethvin> and lots of xml bugs are basically wontfix for the same reason
[09:15:43] <DaveMethvin> but xhtml seems different, we just need a way to prevent regressions
[09:16:02] <DaveMethvin> and of course the caller of our apis needs to follow xhtml rules too but that's their problem
[09:16:28] <snover> you‚Äôd be surprised how quickly it would probably turn into being your problem dave :)
[09:16:43] <DaveMethvin> i'd just tell em that dojo does a better job
[09:17:19] <Ancient> I guess I'm more just concerned about the testability of these features in general. I personally use XHTML and CSP, so I'm constantly testing jQuery under those two things together.
[09:17:32] <Ancient> They have a lot of implications for things in the test suite if we were to run a full suite
[09:17:46] <DaveMethvin> true dat
[09:18:11] <DaveMethvin> csp would have to be a subset or at least skip the breaking parts
[09:18:23] <Ancient> Unless we came up with a way to blacklist certain tests under those environments, some of the tests could never actually pass there, and a test suite that fails every time is as bad as no test suite at all
[09:19:17] <DaveMethvin> the first step would be to see how bad it is currently
[09:19:30] <DaveMethvin> then we figure out if/how/whether to fix it
[09:20:10] <Ancient> well, the test suite index.html isn't valid right now for XHTML, and it's very not valid for a strict CSP environment
[09:21:05] <DaveMethvin> but some of that could be moved into iframed tests for example so the index.html would be valid there
[09:21:19] <snover> Ancient: if you want strict anything, the web platform is really not the right platform :)
[09:21:23] <DaveMethvin> and we could skip those tests based on querystring
[09:21:33] <DaveMethvin> snover: strict chaos
[09:23:32] <Ancient> snover, Perhaps, but it'll never get better if nobody puts an effort into improving it.
[09:23:55] <snover> they did, it was called xhtml2, it is abandoned
[09:23:58] <m_gol> guys, about building instructions: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/#how-to-build-your-own-jquery
[09:24:11] <m_gol> it seems npm global bin directory isn't in PATH by default
[09:24:14] <m_gol> at least on OS X
[09:24:53] <m_gol> so if one hasn't already added it, those instructions might fail
[09:25:13] <Ancient> snover, Yes, and most of the XHTML people are using XHTMl5
[09:26:07] <Ancient> A mashup of the best parts of XHTML and HTML5 that's supported in all modern browsers due to their support for both
[09:26:19] <DaveMethvin> Ancient: this is definitely a scratch-your-itch kind of problem, i'd love it if you would tackle the problem
[09:26:37] <Ancient> DaveMethvin, I'm going to my issues are just that I can't seem to replicate the test swarm environment so far
[09:27:18] <DaveMethvin> if you can run manually with browserstack and verify that it works, we can easily set up a job to run on testswarm when the time comes
[09:28:15] <Ancient> I'm afraid I'm not being clear, I just setup a quick lamp server while we were talking here nad ran the jQuery Test Suite on the 2.x master. I can't get a clean pass in any browser, so somethings wrong with my environment
[09:28:33] <DaveMethvin> what's failing?
[09:30:00] <Ancient> Depending on the browser, between 20 and 50 tests in qUnit
[09:30:17] <Ancient> Which given your build system says they should be fine, means I've got an environment issue testing this
[09:30:25] <DaveMethvin> *which* tests though?
[09:30:35] <DaveMethvin> if they're ajax for example it may be server config
[09:31:24] <Ancient> core tests mainly
[09:31:31] <Ancient> a few support tests
[09:32:13] <DaveMethvin> is this a fresh install? for example did you npm install recently?
[09:32:18] <Ancient> data tests as well, queue tests, atributes test
[09:32:27] <Ancient> npm install as of 30 minutes ago
[09:32:38] <DaveMethvin> that's pretty recent :)
[09:33:06] <DaveMethvin> not sure why anything would fail
[09:33:10] <Ancient> It was in need of an update.
[09:33:28] <DaveMethvin> i just ran tests yesterday before pushing for the beta, and we're all green on the swarm
[09:33:40] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jquery
[09:35:01] <Ancient> yeah, I'm getting errors in firefox, chrome & opera. Going to test some things to try to smooth this out. I need green tests before I can start working on the tests
[09:46:08] <DaveMethvin> xhtml2 great observation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPBvdsFi7Ss#t=1h45m50s
[09:48:38] <Ancient> That draconian error handling is wonderful :)
[09:49:01] <DaveMethvin> that's from last night's presentation in SF
[09:49:22] <DaveMethvin> there's a great pirate talk at the beginning
[09:50:26] <Ancient> That gentleman enjoys yelling into his microphone a bit much for my taste :P
[09:54:47] <Ancient> I'll save you the time though, I've already heard every argument there is to hear against XHTML, and I'd never change instantly knowing the second a mistake makes it's way into our testing environment.
[09:55:26] <Ancient> The only time you anyone has less than perfect output is in the event of a mistake or intentionally thinking it's a good idea to do stupid stuff :P
[09:56:34] <Ancient> I can't help but equate the whole HTMl5 default sloppy syntax to the JavaScript trend where a bunch of people claimed it was better without semicolons
[09:56:44] <Ancient> and stripped out their semicolons and claimed it was an optional feature
[09:58:57] <Ancient> You wouldn't do that to your javascript. I wouldn't do it to my html, and I'd like something to tell me every time one of the young smartasses who works where I do thinks they're too good for either of those.
[11:06:26] <Ancient> Partial success. I've got it working enough that the entire test suite failed to initialize because of the jQuery was invalid.
[11:07:01] <Ancient> because of the bug making jQuery invalid *
[11:26:06] <Ancient> Damn it. The test runner uses document.write();
[11:32:24] <Ancient> DaveMethvin, What is your preferred approach, a server side processing language being required to run *all* tests, or a rewrite of the test running javascript to not rely on synchronous blocking script injection?
[11:46:24] <Ancient> the former is cleaner, and uses what's already used for other portions of the test running, but will introduce breaking changes mostly to automated uses of the test framework like you might encounter in testswarm

[13:31:16] <ajpiano> Now that WaSP is disbanded, would The jQuery Foundation be able to start an initiative alerting users of XP‚Äôs demise? Perhaps members of the foundation can start notifying users on their web sites that XP‚Äôs browsers will no longer be supported in 6months time.
[13:31:44] <DaveMethvin> we could do a blog post perhaps with the next major release
[13:32:02] <DaveMethvin> i figure i'll do a State of jQuery in January, could do it then
[13:32:19] <ajpiano> i sppose we could mention it
[13:32:34] <ajpiano> i don't really feel like it's our burden to bear
[13:32:46] <DaveMethvin> nope it's not
[13:33:01] <DaveMethvin> we got 99 problems but that ain't one

[13:33:26] <DaveMethvin> bitch bitch
[13:33:40] <ajpiano> plz have less fun w/ beta test blog posts DaveMethvin
[13:33:45] <snover> just reply: ‚ÄúYarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr‚Ä¶100 more characters‚Ä¶rrrrrrrr.‚Äù
[13:34:28] <DaveMethvin> it's not unreadable at all, i kept the pirate to a minimum
[13:34:38] <ajpiano> that was my analysis as well
[13:35:06] <DaveMethvin> Excuse me stewardess, I speak pirate
[13:35:34] <snover> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVJPB3W54Tc
[13:35:34] <ajpiano> what is the WaSP
[13:36:12] <snover> Web Standards Project
[13:36:17] <snover> my link is better
[13:39:34] <ajpiano> why is there an "a" in Web
[13:39:47] <snover> don‚Äôt think about it too hard, you will hurt yourself
[13:40:13] <DaveMethvin> stings like a wasp?
