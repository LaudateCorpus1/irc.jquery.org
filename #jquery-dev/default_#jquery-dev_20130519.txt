[16:07:32] <brianng> hi i need help
[16:07:32] <brianng> http://jsfiddle.net/Pqz3p/
[16:08:40] <m_gol> brianng: this is a dev channel, go to #jquery
[16:08:55] <brianng> no one is there
[16:09:08] <DaveMethvin> we're not here either then
[16:10:45] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: who can I ping about the reimbursement procedure? I wrote to accounting@jquery.org a week ago but didn't get a reply
[16:11:04] <DaveMethvin> oh, what was your question?
[16:11:10] <DaveMethvin> did you submit an expense report?
[16:11:25] <m_gol> I did and it got approved, I just don't know how to get the money now :D
[16:11:40] <DaveMethvin> oh, not sure what they were doing for that
[16:11:49] <DaveMethvin> they can use paypal if you hav it
[16:11:53] <m_gol> there is some PayPal/account attaching but only for USA so it's probably not that
[16:12:00] <DaveMethvin> otherwise i think they send a check
[16:12:05] <DaveMethvin> richard worth would know
[16:12:14] <DaveMethvin> rworth
[16:12:34] <m_gol> I do, if that's possible then that's OK but the Expensify site claims PyPal reimburement is also USA-only
