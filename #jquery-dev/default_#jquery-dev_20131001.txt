[11:47:58] <scott_gonzalez> snover: Can you sign our CAA?
[11:48:05] <scott_gonzalez> http://contribute.jquery.org/CAA/
[11:48:30] <scott_gonzalez> We're asking all current and past team members to sign.
[11:49:07] <snover> wow, you do realise this is kind of a shitty agreement right
[11:50:23] <scott_gonzalez> Why?
[11:50:39] <snover> compare. jquery: sign away your copyrights to us. dojo: give us an irrevocable license to use your code.
[11:50:59] <scott_gonzalez> You can sign the CLA if you prefer.
[11:51:28] <snover> i definitely would prefer that.
[11:51:35] <scott_gonzalez> http://contribute.jquery.org/CLA/
[11:51:53] <snover> could have sworn i did this already
[11:52:00] <snover> do you need the email address that i use for github or just any email address?
[11:53:02] <scott_gonzalez> Either. If you use a different address than the one you use for GitHub, we'll need to add a mailmap entry for you.
[11:53:09] <snover> ok
[11:53:14] <snover> i‚Äôll just use the github one i guess
[11:53:23] <snover> it already gets spam anyway
[11:53:42] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I had tried to email you and it bounced.
[11:54:13] <snover> maybe you accidentally tried to use the one from before i understood how git worked and it was set to a machine-local address :)
[11:54:20] <snover> i feel bad about that
[11:54:25] <snover> like a real dumb person
[11:54:28] <snover> but i am smarter now
[11:54:36] <snover> so it kind of works out, right?
[11:54:57] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, no, it was github.com@
[11:55:05] <snover> oh i dunno. maybe i blackholed it due to the‚Ä¶spam‚Ä¶
[11:55:18] <snover> who knows what i do these days
[11:55:36] <scott_gonzalez> Google tried to deliver your message, but it was rejected by the server for the recipient domain zetafleet.com by zero.acitia.com
[11:56:18] <snover> i guess i must have.
[11:56:26] <scott_gonzalez> Oh well, at least now you won't show up in our audit as a contributor who hasn't signed the CLA/CAA.
[11:56:42] <snover> yeah i did
[11:56:44] <snover> sorry about that!
[11:57:08] <snover> just do a sublicensing agreement with the dojo foundation
[11:57:25] <snover> then you will get access to all sorts of amazing ibm talent‚Ä¶
[11:57:27] <snover> ‚Ä¶
[11:58:36] <snover> like this amazing person that the administrator keeps bugging me to deal with who apparently somehow managed to enter their name wrong, their email address wrong, and their dojo foundation username wrong
[11:58:42] <snover> and is emailing us to fix it
[12:00:03] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds like the opposite of what we want. Maybe we'll just blacklist ibm.com addresses...
[12:00:23] <snover> that sounds like a good idea. i wish i could do that.
