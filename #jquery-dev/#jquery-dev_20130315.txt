[08:34:29] <JamesMGreene> Hey scott_gonzalez: Y U NO list jQuery as a dependency in the jQuery UI package.json?
[08:34:30] <b-ot> JamesMGreene: (屮'Д')屮
[08:34:48] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: Because it's not a dependency!
[08:35:18] <scott_gonzalez> Please don't lie in package.json.
[08:35:40] <JamesMGreene> O_o
[08:35:44] <DaveMethvin> not a node dependency for sure, and npm doesn't install it
[08:35:50] <JamesMGreene> jQuery UI can function with jQuery?
[08:35:56] <scott_gonzalez> In node? Absolutely.
[08:35:56] <JamesMGreene> without*
[08:36:20] <JamesMGreene> Interesting, I assumed it would rely on many jQuery core utils o_O
[08:36:28] <scott_gonzalez> Why would we use jQuery in node?
[08:36:36] <scott_gonzalez> We don't even use jQuery UI in node.
[08:36:47] <scott_gonzalez> We just run lots of build stuff in node.
[08:37:07] <DaveMethvin> JamesMGreene you are confusing node dependencies with loaded-in-the-browser dependencies
[08:37:10] <JamesMGreene> I don't really care about using it in Node that much but I, like many others, utilize NPM for package management of web-facing stuff too
[08:37:20] <scott_gonzalez> STOP DOING THAT
[08:37:24] <DaveMethvin> lol
[08:37:24] <JamesMGreene> I guess maybe I should start using browser or something now
[08:37:29] <DaveMethvin> bowser
[08:37:29] <JamesMGreene> bower*
[08:37:35] <DaveMethvin> yeah that
[08:37:38] <JamesMGreene> lol
[08:37:42] <JamesMGreene> silly name
[08:38:02] <JamesMGreene> Speaking of NPM, is it undead yet?
[08:38:07] <JamesMGreene> it was totally hosed earlier
[08:38:25] <scott_gonzalez> working fine for me
[08:38:29] <JamesMGreene> cool
[08:39:37] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: If you haven't noticed there are a few things that immediately send me into a rage.
[08:39:46] <scott_gonzalez> dependency management is one of them.
[08:39:57] <scott_gonzalez> Possibly the biggest one.
[08:39:57] <DaveMethvin> dissing Britney Spears is another
[08:40:14] <scott_gonzalez> Don't fuck with Britney bitch!
[09:20:09] <JamesMGreene> scott_gonzalez: Oh, really? :)
[09:20:13] <JamesMGreene> (LOL)
[10:50:51] <JamesMGreene> aaaaargh
[10:50:57] <JamesMGreene> too much recursion for a Friday
[10:51:05] <JamesMGreene> my brain hurts
