[04:33:39] <jzaefferer> _|Nix|_: just call .attr( "class", "fourth" )?
[04:34:17] <jzaefferer> even if addClass/removeClass don't change anything, they still do a DOM lookup
[06:24:37] <gibson042> .
[06:33:57] <jzaefferer> ?tell DaveMethvin Krinkle scott_gonzalez johnbender testing/ci meeting at noon today!
[06:33:58] <b-ot> jzaefferer, Iâ€™ll tell DaveMethvin about that.
[06:35:18] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I'm driving up to PA today, the time depends on when our friend finally gets up here, so I'm not sure if I'll be around.
[06:38:13] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: okay, we'll see. Any feedback on the first three PRs here though? https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pulls
[06:40:16] <scott_gonzalez> #292 seems fine. Like you said, we might need to patch it in our own repos as we won't get automatic cleanup, but that may just cause memory leaks in oldIE and not break anything.
[06:46:02] <scott_gonzalez> #289 looks ok; I left a comment about a different solution.
[06:59:33] <jzaefferer> cool, thanks
[08:17:43] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: Good point (about the DOM lookup). I'll go with the .data() solution.
[09:26:20] <johnbender> uGoMobi: anything that's not a bug fix related to 1.2 should go into a branch
[09:26:21] <bot-t> (1 hour 50 secs ago) <_|Nix|_> tell johnbender I cannot help but notice that on the buildbot running the tests prints out "Testing ?jquery=1.6.4" whereas on my machine it prints out "Testing kitchensink/" ...
[09:26:29] <johnbender> ugh wrong channel
[09:26:52] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: join #jquery-meeting :-)
[09:29:00] <uGoMobi> johnbender: are you lost? ;-)
[09:29:40] <johnbender> uGoMobi: no :(
[09:30:05] <uGoMobi> ok :D
