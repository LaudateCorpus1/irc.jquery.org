[08:26:04] <ryanneufeld> hey mikesherov
[08:26:20] <mikesherov> yo
[08:26:24] <ryanneufeld> I just saw you email. I was wondering
[08:26:37] <ryanneufeld> if SVG is a wont fix
[08:26:52] <ryanneufeld> would a plugin to solve the problems be a better solution?
[08:27:24] <ryanneufeld> otherwise only fixing the low hanging fruit could confuse some devs
[08:27:42] <ryanneufeld> just a thought (at 8am on a sunday with no coffee)
[08:41:03] <mikesherov> no, it's a good thgouht
[08:41:27] <mikesherov> That's why SVG is on our wontfix list
[08:41:59] <mikesherov> the fix though is something like 10 bytes
[08:42:19] <mikesherov> and I fixed an SVG bug like two weeks ago when I introduced a regression in 1.8
[08:42:35] <mikesherov> at the end of the day
[08:42:47] <mikesherov> ryanneufeld: you're right
[08:43:55] <mikesherov> I'm just trying to get a canonical answer rather than one offs
