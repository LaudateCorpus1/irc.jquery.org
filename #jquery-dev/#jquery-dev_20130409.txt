[04:55:29] <m_gol> DaveMethvin, since I don't see 2.0.0-b3 (remember about semver versioning! :)) and considering what you said yesterday... Did you die trying? :P
[04:56:08] <DaveMethvin> m_gol almost ... it just got late and i figured i'd do it this morning
[04:56:18] <DaveMethvin> doing the final stuff now
[04:56:54] <m_gol> cool :)

[06:07:36] <DaveMethvin> you've got to get up PRETTY EARLY IN THE MORNING to put one over on that JamesMGreene :)
[06:07:41] <DaveMethvin> so i slept in
[06:08:36] <scott_gonzalez> Dylan woke me up at 5:30. I don't think waking up early helps me :-P
[06:09:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i like summer but the cats think the crack of dawn is feeding time

[07:04:10] <gibson042> hmm, could be
[07:05:29] <DaveMethvin> i just love how these guys doing crazy-ass XSLT transforms just can't understand how their stuff doesn't work, when it's probably only used by 0.000001% of devs
[07:06:15] <gibson042> and *obviously* jQuery should function perfectly for them
[07:06:34] <DaveMethvin> and if it doesn't we should do our own js-based xml parser

[10:29:50] <JamesMGreene> gnarf: Kinda figured, thanks for verifying
[10:58:29] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer Krinkle: The TestSwarm logo was used in today's BrowserStack email newsletter but they used the logo which still says "Mozilla Labs Test Swarm"
[10:58:45] <JamesMGreene> Should we send them a note to update the logo they're using or something?
[10:58:58] <JamesMGreene> cc: ajpiano ?
[10:59:51] <ajpiano> yea, i suppose so, do we even have an update logo for testswawm
[11:00:44] <JamesMGreene> I don't think we have a logo at all right now...
[11:00:47] <JamesMGreene> https://twimg0-a.akamaihd.net/profile_images/2904396844/592589829f589478d91c6ae353e18a75.png ? LOL :)
[11:01:11] <ajpiano> lol
[11:03:09] <JamesMGreene> btw, have you guys seen Queen? http://queenjs.com/
[11:04:24] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer Krinkle ajpiano ^
[11:04:54] <ajpiano> i certainly haven't
[11:05:05] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: We dont have a logo indeed. We are waiting for (someone to tell) the design team to create a logo.
[11:05:19] <Krinkle> the mozilla labs logo is old, browserstack should not have used that, it is nolonger used anywhere.
[11:05:41] <Krinkle> They went out of there way to get that logo, that should make one realise that perhaps it shouldn't be used.
[11:05:49] <ajpiano> there's a design team to tell ?
[11:05:52] <ajpiano> heh
[11:09:24] <JamesMGreene> How does one get in touch with said design team?
[11:09:43] <ajpiano> there is no design team, we have some design resources we can call on i suppose
[11:10:09] <JamesMGreene> Well I assume someone was responsible for turning qunitjs.com purple :)
[11:10:44] <ajpiano> hehe
[11:10:50] <JamesMGreene> (I like the purple, actually)
[11:11:17] <ajpiano> we were working with a company on tightening up our logos and colours
[11:11:25] <ajpiano> creating a new logo for ts wasn't part of that project
[11:11:30] <ajpiano> they came up with the purple
[11:11:37] <Krinkle> ajpiano: Not a team of jQuery members, but we do have a fixed cont(r)act with a design firm that knows us.
[11:11:47] <Krinkle> right?
[11:11:51] <Krinkle> e.g. they have our files and stuff.
[11:12:14] <ajpiano> i don't believe we have a fixed contract anymore, but i can check
[11:12:15] <Krinkle> ajpiano: Indeed, ts came a few weeks after the latest redesign was completed.
[11:12:25] <ajpiano> i'm creating an issue on foundation for creating the logo
[11:13:28] <JamesMGreene> thanks, ajpiano
[11:13:54] <insign> Hi, is possible get all elements, except the first? Existe a select for this?
[11:14:30] <ajpiano> insign: this chanel is for jquery development only, please head to #jquery for support questions
[11:14:43] <insign> sorry
[11:31:15] <JamesMGreene> Haha, yes! I get to organize a Nodecopter Summer of Drones event :)
[12:20:34] <m_gol> wow, you guys really plan to ship 2.0 final in 10 days? won't there be any rc version?
[12:21:04] <DaveMethvin> no need for an rc if nobody reports anything serious
[12:21:21] <DaveMethvin> and from history, very few people test either the beta or the rc anyway
[12:27:47] <snover> where are my modules, dave
[12:31:33] <m_gol> nice, we should have a site working on 2.0 only in production near the end of May
[13:14:51] <m_gol> guys, what do you think about leaving out undefined from main IIFE?
[13:15:28] <m_gol> adds 458 bytes to minified but, weirdly, saves 62 gzipped
[13:15:51] <DaveMethvin>  wat
[13:16:18] <DaveMethvin> i'm sure gibson042 will say "of course" but seems strange to me
[13:16:52] <m_gol> yeah, my reaction, too
[13:16:57] <gibson042> m_gol: where do you "define" undefined if not the main IIFE?
[13:17:16] <m_gol> nowhere, why?
[13:17:33] <gibson042> or are would we say that we no longer work in environments where typeof undefined !== "undefined"
[13:17:44] <m_gol> ahh
[13:17:47] <m_gol> Android 2.3 :(
[13:18:06] * DaveMethvin shakes fist
[13:18:15] <m_gol> undefined is immutable in ES5
[13:18:40] <DaveMethvin> i just don't understand how it could save 62 gz
[13:19:08] <m_gol> hm, iOS 5.1 behaves sane but Android even in 4.0 has mutable undefined
[13:19:35] <gibson042> because literal sequence "undefined" repeating all over the place is very nice for compression, even more so with the `typeof`s
[13:19:42] <DaveMethvin> well anyone who redefines undefined is a poo-poo head
[13:19:43] <m_gol> IE is sane from 9 in this so we're stuck because of Android
[13:19:48] <gibson042> right now, uglify converts it into a single-char variable
[13:20:00] <gibson042> 62 seems high but not inconceivable
[13:20:59] <gibson042> don't get me wrong, we already disallow Object.prototype mutation so disallowing setting undefined is probably fine
[13:21:29] <m_gol> works fine on Nexus 7 (Android 4.1) but it's mutable on Galaxy Nexus (4.0)
[13:23:23] <m_gol> I guess we don't want to assume that if it has to work on Android < 4.1 then undefined can't be modified before jQuery?
[13:23:45] <DaveMethvin> who's gonna modify undefined and live to tell about it?
[13:24:10] <m_gol> :D
[13:24:41] <m_gol> dunno, 62 bytes seem nice, though ;)
[13:25:23] <m_gol> funny thing, it actually adds 1 byte to non-minified gzipped
[13:30:35] <m_gol> ;)
[13:42:42] <SlexAxton> rwaldron: cool! I was just setting expectations low, as to make sure that we exceed them.
[13:42:46] <SlexAxton> definitely not talking trash
[13:42:49] <SlexAxton> fwiw
[16:51:04] <jdalton> ping

[16:51:26] <jdalton> I read a post saying jq recently got updates
[16:51:29] <jdalton> curious what they were
[17:18:27] <DaveMethvin> jdalton they were in sizzle
[17:18:41] <DaveMethvin> there were some feature detects for oldIE that had to be redone
[17:18:52] <DaveMethvin> because they triggered security warnings in IE10 apps
[17:19:05] <DaveMethvin> "Windows Store Apps"
[17:19:46] <DaveMethvin> "The apps formerly known as Metro ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
[17:21:07] <m_gol> everyone still calls them that unofficially ;)

[17:23:38] <jdalton> thats lame
[17:24:16] <DaveMethvin> i wasn't sure how the name attr could pose a security issue myself
[17:24:31] <m_gol> weird
[17:24:33] <jdalton> they have a safe html thang
[17:25:01] <DaveMethvin> which i like actually, i would love to have a native code parser/filter at our disposal
[17:25:02] <jdalton> name may be treated like id, and so would then be an implicit global?
[17:25:08] <jdalton> i'm just throwing this stuff out 
[17:25:10] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah 
[17:25:14] <DaveMethvin> good guess tho
[17:25:20] <jdalton> and do <input name=foo>
[17:25:21] <jdalton> window.foo
[17:25:31] <jdalton> smth smth xss
[17:25:36] <DaveMethvin> lol
[17:25:46] <snover> gee, if only there was a spec that said to not do that
[17:25:54] <m_gol> I though the last browser to treat name & id as brothers was IE7 or 8...
[17:26:13] <DaveMethvin> if ever there was a time to break compat, this would be it
[17:26:35] <jdalton> ya interesting though
[17:27:31] <jdalton> blink is an unsafe element yall
[17:27:59] <DaveMethvin> because half the time it's invisible, duh
[17:28:45] <jdalton> oh ya!
[17:29:13] <snover> DaveMethvin: where are my modules!!
[17:29:33] <DaveMethvin> here they are ri...oh damn there was a hole in my pocket

[17:30:44] <snover> ﴾͡๏̯͡๏﴿ O'RLY?
[17:31:16] <DaveMethvin> but at least we're down under 10k for basic stuff now
[17:31:33] <DaveMethvin> you don't need our animations or ajax i suspect
[17:31:48] <m_gol> btw, where did that "remove undefined from IIFE parameters" proposal go?
[17:31:53] <snover> i might want the animations, since i don’t trust anyone else to do that
[17:31:54] <snover> i mean
[17:32:01] <snover> i don’t trust the people at my disposal currently
[17:32:24] <DaveMethvin> m_gol you should make a ticket ... i think we could do it
[17:32:30] <m_gol> yeah, will do
[17:32:34] <snover> i don’t trust node.js either, there is an exception somewhere in here but node-inspector is showing me no stack
[17:32:39] <snover> and no console output
[17:32:47] <snover> good game node
[17:32:52] <DaveMethvin> atm if you go with our animations you have to go with our promises too
[17:33:13] <jdalton> i recently removed it from my IFFE
[17:33:16] <jdalton> wait
[17:33:18] <jdalton> IIFE
[17:33:26] <jdalton> so devs could customize it moar
[17:33:41] <DaveMethvin> jdalton FINALLY i can customize `undefined`
[17:33:46] <DaveMethvin> always wanted to do tat
[17:34:17] <DaveMethvin> but really if anyone redefs undefined ... well they're screwed
[17:34:34] <DaveMethvin> m_gol was saying it saves us a bunch of bytes to not put it in the IIFE
[17:35:10] <snover> DaveMethvin: do animations fail sometimes?
[17:35:21] <jdalton> minifiers will change it to void 0
[17:35:38] <DaveMethvin> snover i don't think they ever take the fail path right now
[17:35:45] <jdalton> no i keep `undefined` out of the iife and define it inside, so devs can customize the iife
[17:37:45] <m_gol> the thing is only Android <4.1 has mutable undefined
[17:37:50] <m_gol> from browsers supported in 2.x
[17:38:20] <m_gol> so if you tried to redefine undefined, you'd fail anyway in most cases
[17:38:51] <m_gol> hardly anyone would target only the stock browser from Android < 4.1...
[17:39:09] <m_gol> so I'm not sure if it's risky
[17:39:56] <m_gol> it's immutable everywhere, not just in strict mode
[17:40:01] <jdalton> for modern go joe!
[17:40:33] <DaveMethvin> i'm just tryna figure how life could go on if `undefined` was redefined, even when it can be
[17:40:57] <jdalton> my heart will go on
[17:43:08] <m_gol> the only difference, IIRC, is that outside of strict it's noop and in strict it throws
[17:43:33] <m_gol> too bad we can't go strict just yet :(
[17:43:49] <m_gol> ticket about that: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13759
[17:44:04] <DaveMethvin> if someone expected jquery to work with undefined being hosed I'd say (－‸ლ)
[17:47:33] <m_gol> I see only one sane way to potentially use it
[17:47:41] <m_gol> var undefined = null;
[17:47:42] <m_gol> ;)
[17:50:07] <snover> it is not really that sad
[17:50:11] <snover> that you cannot use strict mode
[17:50:31] <DaveMethvin> we get most of the same benefits with jshint
[17:51:07] <m_gol> true that
[17:52:38] <m_gol> we'd have to keep it non-strict compatible anyway 'cause of IE9
[17:56:34] <m_gol> hm
[17:56:43] <m_gol> why window.getComputedStyle in getStyles?
[17:56:46] <m_gol> I mean, I know why
[17:57:17] <m_gol> it's just that we have (function ( window ) {/* ... */})( this )
[17:57:26] <m_gol> so that's not exactly window in node...
[17:58:39] <DaveMethvin> we need some people to really try out jQuery+jsdom etc in node to see what we missed
[17:59:36] <m_gol> and it's in many more places; window.addEventListener etc.
[18:00:16] <m_gol> I'm not sure if we don't have to do (function ( global, window ) {/* ... */})( this, window )
[18:00:45] <m_gol> I mean, we need global only to expose jQuery, I guess
[18:00:59] <m_gol> but we need window to a whole lot more...
[18:01:12] <DaveMethvin> we could expose jQuery on window
[18:01:22] <DaveMethvin> we also expose it as a module
[18:01:48] <DaveMethvin> it kinda depends on how people are using it
[18:01:53] <m_gol> hmm, not a bad idea
[18:02:00] <m_gol> yeah, but current state is weird
[18:02:14] <DaveMethvin> mainly b/c i don't think it's been well tested
[18:02:29] <m_gol> additional bytes for getComputedStyle that fix nothing don't look very good to me :D
[18:08:56] <m_gol> ok, this needs to be discussed, I created a ticket: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13760
[18:10:19] <DaveMethvin> m_gol when do you sleep? :)
[18:11:52] <m_gol> well, my mental timezone has shifted a little compared to where I live :D
[18:12:45] <m_gol> but now that you said it... 3 a.m. is probably a good time to finally go to bed :D
[18:13:03] <m_gol> thx for the mail, I appreciate the appreciation ;) CU
[18:13:15] <DaveMethvin> sure! sleep well
[21:24:17] <JamesMGreene> [15:42] <SlexAxton> rwaldron: cool! I was just setting expectations low, as to make sure that we exceed them.
[21:24:22] <JamesMGreene> ^ rw-tab fail :)
