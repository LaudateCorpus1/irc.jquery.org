[11:40:44] <rwaldron> m_gol pong
[11:40:59] <m_gol> rwaldron: a quick question: is this gist correct? https://gist.github.com/mzgol/8305487
[11:41:15] <m_gol> I'm asking bc Chrome, IE11 execute it just fine while jsHint complain
[11:41:23] <m_gol> and I'm not sure what current consensus is
[11:48:50] <rwaldron> m_gol yes, that's correct
[11:49:07] <m_gol> ok, I'll report a bug to jsHint
[11:49:07] <rwaldron> if you called o.f(); before const a = ... then it would be an error
[11:49:16] <rwaldron> this is the temporal dead zone
[11:49:23] <rwaldron> let and const don't hoist
[11:49:30] <rwaldron> nice bug :)
[11:53:24] <m_gol> rwaldron: https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/1462
[11:53:29] <m_gol> thx for the help :)
[11:53:56] <m_gol> I wasn't sure if the temporal dead zone applied to code defined before the declaration but evaluated afterwards :)
[11:54:11] <rwaldron> m_gol of course, my pleasure
[11:54:27] <rwaldron> I just backed you up on that first bug
[11:54:36] <rwaldron> and your example gist gave me an idea
[11:54:42] <rwaldron> JSHint should have a TDZ check
[11:54:44] <rwaldron> :)
[11:57:52] <m_gol> yeah, that would be great to have :)
[12:02:33] <rwaldron> I just realized this would be pretty complicated
[12:03:04] <rwaldron> you'd have to keep a tally of all occurrences of identifiers and the paths to reach them
[12:03:47] <rwaldron> and then check that the binding initialization happens before those "paths to reach them" are invoked.
[12:07:29] <rwaldron> m_gol anyway, this is a really important bug to fix
[12:07:36] <rwaldron> I'm glad you found it
[12:13:49] <m_gol> rwaldron catching such thing is easy if you have let/const all over the place and you update jsHint and now there are 20 linting errors ;)
[12:17:52] <rwaldron> haha
