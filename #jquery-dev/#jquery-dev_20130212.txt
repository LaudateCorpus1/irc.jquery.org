[04:41:04] <siovene> scott_gonzalez: thanks for the tip on core.excludedfiles
[04:41:24] <scott_gonzalez> siovene: No problem. It's one of those features everyone should know about but few do.
[04:42:04] <scott_gonzalez> It takes a while to discover features in git.

[11:28:56] <Gho5t> to carry on from yesterday, are there really no use cases for browser sniffing?
[11:29:29] <Gho5t> I believe I have one and was just told in #jquery to do my own sniffing
[11:30:21] <DaveMethvin> sure if you can't feature test
[11:30:47] <Gho5t> so why remove it then
[11:30:49] <Gho5t> if there are use cases
[11:31:01] <Gho5t> now everyone needs to write their own detection function
[11:31:08] <Gho5t> I liked the abstraction we had in jQuery
[11:33:27] <DaveMethvin> there was no abstraction, just a navigator.userAgent sniff
[11:33:34] <DaveMethvin> and most of the time it was misused
[11:33:51] <DaveMethvin> so if people want to simply reinsert bad code i cannot stop them
[11:34:02] <DaveMethvin> sure there are legit uses
[11:34:28] <DaveMethvin> for example, you are looking for iphones so you can pop up something to tell them you won't let them into the site until they download your app from the store
[11:37:24] <Gho5t> well it's an abstraction in that we are off-loading it to jQuery and if in the future the function needed to be updated or altered for new browsers or a more optimized way surfaces, we had it
[11:37:39] <Gho5t> kinda like .size() just returns .length
[11:37:52] <Gho5t> but is recommended
[11:38:25] <Gho5t> let me restate
[11:38:56] <Gho5t> well it's an abstraction in that we are off-loading it to jQuery and if in the future the function needed to be updated or altered for new browsers or a more optimized way surfaces,  it would be seamless
[11:39:59] <DaveMethvin> it didn't work out that way in the past ... for example there is a .webkit property and people inferred the wrong things about that as webkit fractured into several differnet implementations
[11:40:11] <DaveMethvin> that isn't a problem with feature detection
[12:28:56] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin... you blitzed me!
[12:29:18] <DaveMethvin> CAN'T PEOPLE READ
[12:32:10] <rwaldron> fooooreal
[12:32:39] <rwaldron> if dataset were implemented in every browser that we supported, we could do it.
[12:32:43] <rwaldron> But I don't think it is
[12:33:02] <rwaldron> correction: I don't know and I'm not going to look right no
[12:33:03] <rwaldron> now*
[18:05:43] <miketaylr> back
[18:06:05] <DaveMethvin> finally!
[18:12:42] <miketaylr> lol
[18:12:57] <miketaylr> DaveMethvin: apparently i've got a shortcut that spams channels :S
[18:13:51] <DaveMethvin> i'm using a new irc client, i'm surprised i haven't melted down the channel yet
[18:14:27] <DaveMethvin> wait until i start experimenting with scripts
[18:16:01] <miketaylr> which client?
[18:16:10] <DaveMethvin> mirc windows
[18:20:16] <miketaylr> super 133t
[18:21:13] <DaveMethvin> definitely, it must be 1337 because i can't do anything without a half-dozen google searches
