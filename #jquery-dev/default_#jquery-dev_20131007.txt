[06:27:34] <scott_gonzalez> I'm honestly surprised that people feel like installing grunt-cli and bower locally for every single contributor is a better option than just including the actual dependencies in the repo.
[06:33:21] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: including all dependencies is just impossible due to size
[06:33:40] <scott_gonzalez> WAT?
[06:33:40] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: when we make decision that affect another live how much more complicated thing become
[06:34:04] <scott_gonzalez> I'm talking about bower dependencies, specifically.
[06:34:40] <scott_gonzalez> You'll notice that we didn't get complaints about grunt not working.
[06:35:03] <scott_gonzalez> We've only been getting complaints about bower. Which, you may recall I said would happen.
[06:36:49] <scott_gonzalez> If we want to embrace these projects and encourage devs to use them, we should encourage proper usage.
[06:37:38] <scott_gonzalez> If these tools are as important and useful as we think, people will just start installing them during their normal new computer setup.
[06:37:51] <scott_gonzalez> Right along with things like node and git.
[06:39:58] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, we're not only going against what grunt and bower recommend. We're going against what npm recommends.
[06:40:13] <scott_gonzalez> npm install scripts are an anti-pattern, according to npm's own docs.
[06:45:30] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: do you have a link?
[06:45:51] <m_gol> also: where are we going against what Grunt recommends?
[06:47:45] <scott_gonzalez> Installing grunt-cli locally.
[06:47:50] <scott_gonzalez> A link for npm's docs?
[06:48:15] <scott_gonzalez> https://npmjs.org/doc/misc/npm-scripts.html#NOTE-INSTALL-SCRIPTS-ARE-AN-ANTIPATTERN
[06:53:15] <m_gol> ah, this
[06:53:51] <m_gol> heh
[06:54:26] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: so you say that if we included bower packages (and that's it) people won't send us patches to have grunt-cli installed globally?
[06:56:20] <scott_gonzalez> Were we getting them before?
[07:00:25] <m_gol> I think it just sucks you can't easily declare global dependencies in package.json
[07:01:30] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it makes sense.
[07:02:13] <scott_gonzalez> We can be nice and have the install script not just warn, but ask the user if they'd like to install them now.
[07:02:24] <scott_gonzalez> And if they say yes, run `npm install -g grunt-cli bower`.
[07:02:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure if we can prompt the user like that from the install script though.
[07:02:48] <scott_gonzalez> But we could try.
[07:14:30] <m_gol> I get why `npm install` can install global dependencies as well, but it would be nice if it was able to print a nice message to the user that he/she needs to invoke one specific command installing some global packages
[07:14:36] <m_gol> and then it could exit
[07:16:25] <m_gol> or just ask if you allow it to install them, as you said
[08:03:39] <m_gol> the difference between Blink and WebKit
[08:03:54] <m_gol> Blink bug reports are actually read :/
[08:03:56] <m_gol> https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=304700
[08:04:02] <m_gol> https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=122416
[08:05:14] <arschmitz> pretty quickly even
[08:07:07] <m_gol> yup
[08:07:54] <m_gol> well, I could understand some time of no reply
[08:07:56] <m_gol> but... https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=111307
