[04:25:02] <terrycojones> I'm trying to run the jquery test suite. I've done it in the past, but don't remember exactly what I did.  IIRC, the last time I just opened test/index.html in my browser and it worked fine. I do have a PHP capable http server (apache) running on port 80.  It looks like I might need to be restarting chrome with  --allow-file-access-from-files but I don't think I did that last time around.  The Running the Unit Tests section of th
[04:25:02] <terrycojones> github page doesn't actually tell you how to run the unit tests :-)

[04:43:45] <terrycojones> ok, i worked it out.
