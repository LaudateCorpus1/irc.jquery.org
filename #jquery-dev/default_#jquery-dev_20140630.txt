[13:45:37] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: I don't suspect anyone thinks it will be a shared account after the jquery user is added. I can state that explicitly if you like.
[13:46:02] <timmywil> Or do you have qualms about taking over the existing package.
[13:46:02] <scott_gonzalez> The jquery user is a shared account.
[13:46:14] <timmywil> Oh that
[13:46:56] <timmywil> Shall we make it timmywil first then?
[13:47:01] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:47:05] <timmywil> ok
[13:47:33] <scott_gonzalez> That way it's clear who is actually using the account, and we don't have issues with team members that leave the project.
[13:47:49] <timmywil> gotcha, didn't know we dropped the jquery user
[13:49:08] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, jquery is no longer an owner of the jquery package.
