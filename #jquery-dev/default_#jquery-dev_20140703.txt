[11:31:29] <tj_vantoll> fyi here's my first stab at the progressbar widget as a web component: https://github.com/tjvantoll/ui-web-components
[11:32:23] <tj_vantoll> Canary only because HTML imports aren't in stable yet. The widget doesn't use shadow DOM or the template element (yet), but I'm going to experiment with those next.
[11:39:00] <tj_vantoll> Ah, meant that for #jqueryui-dev.
[22:27:26] <Ancient> Has any thought been given to moving "use strict"; to an optional module that can be enabled via grunt?
