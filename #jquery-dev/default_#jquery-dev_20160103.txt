[00:28:44] <laughinghan> what is the workflow with the master vs compat branches, and similarly 1.x-stable vs 2.x-stable?
[00:28:44] <laughinghan> are they long-running parallel branches, with features and fixes separately merged into each?
[00:29:31] <laughinghan> or is one typically ahead of the other, like, is compat typically master+compat patches, so when a new feature or fix is added, it's merged into master, and then master is merged into compat?
[00:37:29] <laughinghan> or maybe it's cherry-picked between branches like https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/154166458284bcce7d6a86328b7fd13483232a1a and https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/64f7d10980a5e9f2862f1239a37d95e6c39e37ec ?
