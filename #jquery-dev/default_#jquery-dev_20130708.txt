[10:17:14] <timmywil> mikesherov: ahah, I haven't seen a reply to this yet (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013Jul/0101.html). That's what it was.
[10:39:30] <scott_gonzalez> This is just an idea I had during the meeting. I haven't done any real testing of it, but... https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/8f9976b405ef4092caf8
[11:03:36] <snover> scott_gonzalez: what is this? has.js?
[11:04:12] <scott_gonzalez> Sort of.
[11:04:37] <scott_gonzalez> The question is how do we make support tests lazy but keep subsequent calls efficient.
[11:04:52] <paul_irish> m_gol, DaveMethvin. i think you guys saw. the sourcemap message was suspended and we merged it to beta too.
[11:04:57] <scott_gonzalez> I was trying to not massively change how all of our methods are currently written.
[11:07:43] <orkel> scott_gonzalez: this is exactly how i wanted to approach that :-)
[11:08:35] <snover> scott_gonzalez: try has.js :P
[11:08:44] <snover> i mean
[11:08:46] <snover> i get where you are coming from
[11:09:34] <snover> but itâ€™s not like it is hard to do a find-and-replace $.support -> has()
[11:10:01] <snover> (of course my feedback is based on knowing approximately 0% of the conversation going on right now :))
[11:10:21] <scott_gonzalez> There was concern of invoking a function every time.
[11:11:28] <snover> thatâ€™s a silly concern, jit will see it is a hot path and inline
[11:11:54] <snover> and of course, if you want speed, do a build
[11:12:12] <snover> then you can turn those has calls into static properties that get optimised out by dead code removal where possible
