[20:20:42] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: ping
[20:20:55] <JamesMGreene> scott_gonzalez: pong
[20:21:02] <scott_gonzalez> Yay, I finally caught you online.
[20:21:08] <scott_gonzalez> Have you had a chance to look at the AMD PR?
[20:21:28] <JamesMGreene> sorry, rough patch of days to say the least (totaled my car in an accident)
[20:21:33] <JamesMGreene> let me take a peek
[20:21:39] <scott_gonzalez> Oh no. Is everyone ok?
[20:23:03] <JamesMGreene> Yeah
[20:23:11] <JamesMGreene> Minus my car :'(
[20:23:31] <JamesMGreene> I was alone, so that's good. No toddler or wife along at the time
[20:23:37] <JamesMGreene> Plenty sore but nothing too crazy
[20:23:42] <JamesMGreene> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/791  <-- You mean this merged PR?
[20:25:39] <scott_gonzalez> Nope. This one: https://github.com/JamesMGreene/qunit-composite/pull/16
[20:26:12] <JamesMGreene> lol, oh, hadn't even seen that one yet x_x
[20:26:18] <JamesMGreene> thanks for the link
[20:27:11] <scott_gonzalez> FYI: This is the last step in switching the jQuery UI test suite over to AMD. See https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1528
[20:28:57] <JamesMGreene> I'm assuming you've tried your PR branch with that and it worked?
[20:29:18] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[20:29:28] <scott_gonzalez> Without it, I just got a blank page :-P
[20:29:51] <scott_gonzalez> The UMD wrapper at the top is obviously for loading qunit-composite itself via AMD.
[20:30:16] <scott_gonzalez> The conditional in the middle is checking if an AMD loader exists on the subsuite page that was loaded into the iframe.
[20:30:55] <JamesMGreene> yup, all looks reasonable to me
[20:31:02] <scott_gonzalez> If one does exist, it uses that to notify qunit-composite when QUnit has been loaded so it can do all the setup.
[20:31:05] <JamesMGreene> Since I have your attention, thoughts on https://github.com/JamesMGreene/qunit-composite/pull/4 ?
[20:31:16] <scott_gonzalez> For a while, I thought this would end up being impossible without modifying QUnit itself to fire some event.
[20:31:47] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy. Well, right off the bat that just seems like a lot of code.
[20:31:57] <JamesMGreene> Well
[20:32:03] <JamesMGreene> I'm more interested in your thoughts on the idea
[20:32:20] <JamesMGreene> Propagating the URL query params to sub-suites
[20:32:26] <JamesMGreene> Makes sense to me
[20:32:34] <scott_gonzalez> Let me see if we're handling this in UI.
[20:32:45] <JamesMGreene> but since he specifically cited jQuery UI tests as doing something similar, definitely worth a chat
[20:35:02] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, you'll notice that our implementation is much much smaller.
[20:37:11] <scott_gonzalez> I think this can be simplified.
[20:37:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'll do a full review of this tomorrow.
[20:44:09] <JamesMGreene> thanks
