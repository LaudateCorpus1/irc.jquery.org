[08:46:33] <gnarf> mikesherov: is there a value i can pass to the maximumLineLength rule to disable it?
[08:46:38] <gnarf> my editor has a default of like 110
[08:46:46] <gnarf> that is getting picked up in the jquery source
[08:47:23] <gnarf> mikesherov: and I wanted to disable it 
[08:48:33] <gnarf> interestingly, only one line of code is >110
[08:48:42] <gnarf> which i might suggest we enable
[08:48:59] <gnarf> sane default for PR reviews

[10:44:52] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Core build #1350: FIXED in 7 min 44 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core/1350/
[10:44:58] <m_gol> timmywil: thanks to gnarf we now have unbroken setup again :)
[10:51:10] <gnarf> Sorry for that oversight --- I think I customized that file on the jenkins box and the update to php must of overwritten
[10:51:16] <gnarf> now ensured by puppet tho
[10:51:21] <gnarf> \o/
[10:57:43] <gnarf> already found a tiny logic error in jQuery.Tween :)
[10:57:50] <gnarf> (for plain object animation)
[11:06:05] <m_gol> gnarf: IE seems to have problems connecting to TestSwarm
[11:06:18] <gnarf> m_gol: ?
[11:06:24] <m_gol> I see this: /Users/mgol/Desktop/Screen Shot 2015-05-18 at 20.05.46.png
[11:06:26] <m_gol> crap
[11:07:23] <m_gol> gnarf: http://oi61.tinypic.com/262psw4.jpg
[11:07:49] <m_gol> it looks like that: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/552. jobs waiting
[11:08:00] <m_gol> not sure if BrowserStack broke sth or it's on our side
[11:08:25] <m_gol> jobs are spawned (you can see them appearing at https://browserstack.com/automate) but no communication back
[11:08:38] <gnarf> cc Krinkle|detached ?
[11:08:59] <gnarf> m_gol: do you know the runurl?
[11:09:09] <m_gol> yup
[11:09:40] <m_gol> funny your last manual run went through fine :)
[11:09:55] <m_gol> but I restarted failures in the previous one and they got stuck on IE
[11:10:40] <m_gol> IE10 works, IE8-9 & 11 don't
[11:10:50] <gnarf> m_gol: i just spawned a live connection
[11:10:51] <gnarf> it seems okay
[11:11:00] <gnarf> that seems like a browserstack automation problem?
[11:11:10] <m_gol> hmm
[11:11:33] <gnarf> m_gol: see PM for url

[13:32:56] <gnarf> gibson042: m_gol: I think it covers that one
[13:33:31] <gnarf> nope
[13:33:32] <gnarf> same error
[13:33:37] <gnarf> but different reason
[13:33:42] <gnarf> on .get() 
[13:33:47] <gibson042> ok
[13:36:31] <gnarf> added a specific test case for that issue too
[13:37:11] <gnarf> there is a bit of a black hole still
[13:37:17] <gnarf> if the object has a style: {}
[13:37:22] <gibson042> right
[13:37:32] <gibson042> something like that was expected
[13:37:49] <gibson042> although I think the proper test would be nodeType === 1
