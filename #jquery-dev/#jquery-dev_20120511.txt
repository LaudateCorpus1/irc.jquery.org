[01:24:30] <atul_> hello all
[01:24:44] <atul_> is anyone available to answer
[01:26:26] <atul_> anyone, please
[07:05:02] <scott_gonzalez> How do you send someone a message on GitHub?
[07:34:05] <DaveMethvin> .
[09:43:32] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Your replies in Trac have been pretty entertaining recently :-)
[09:44:15] <DaveMethvin> well i try not to be mean ... but i want to give you guys a chuckle.
[09:45:24] <scott_gonzalez> I can't get to jqueryui.com today, it's making things tough :-/
[09:45:53] <scott_gonzalez> I can ping it, but it just spins in my browser.
[09:46:31] <DaveMethvin> uh oh
[09:56:36] <scott_gonzalez> "But due to a strange issue with CoffeeScript" ugh
[09:57:05] <scott_gonzalez> Let me inundate you with details about how my app is broken...
[10:11:05] <DaveMethvin> right and i am not sure that coffeescript is wrong there, it seems like he expected '' to be treated like null/undefined?
[10:13:31] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't look at the code :-P
[10:15:22] <scott_gonzalez> hmm... http://cl.ly/1E2O0T3b0r1C0z1n1A2P

[10:26:00] <bartmax> easy way to do siblings() including the picked element ?

[10:26:41] <bartmax> uh sorry wrong channel!
[10:26:44] <bartmax> my bad
[10:26:58] <bartmax> sorry
[10:27:07] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[12:22:55] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ya?
[12:23:03] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: how long was that going on?
[12:23:24] <scott_gonzalez> It still is, but only if you go directly to the IP or proxy-xx.jquery.net
[12:23:55] <scott_gonzalez> I can't get to *.jqueryui.com. I can ping and run a traceroute, but it won't load in my browser and curl just hangs.
[12:24:07] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea what's going on, but I assume it's between me and the server.
[12:24:10] <gnarf> hrm - i can load jqueryui.com
[12:24:46] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, jqueryui.com is working, I just can't seem to load it :-(
[12:24:58] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know why proxy-02.jquery.net gives that message though?
[12:38:02] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: no i don't
[12:38:18] <gnarf> i imagine its a generic error message
[12:38:33] <gnarf> and the fact that you are hitting a domain that isn't mapped to a proxy you get the generic error msg
[12:38:43] <gnarf> rwaldron: you around?
[12:39:19] <gnarf> rwaldron: how do i get the grunt compare size task to use a specific point for comparison rather than forcing it to "master" ?
[12:39:42] <rwaldron> I haven't added that functionality
[12:39:51] <rwaldron> feel free to fork and upgrade
[12:39:58] <rwaldron> i'll land and publish
[12:40:00] <gnarf> rwaldron: i might try :)
[12:40:10] <rwaldron> by all means :)
[12:40:29] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: You can temporarily just go into node_modules/... and change the code :-P
[12:40:41] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: Did you see sindresorhus' size diff task?
[12:42:46] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez no
[12:43:05] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-sizediff
[12:43:17] <scott_gonzalez> It addresses gnarf's question.
[12:43:28] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer asked why he didn't just submit a PR against yours.
[12:44:07] <rwaldron> its basically the same code
[12:45:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, not sure why a new task was built.
[12:45:37] <rwaldron> ?tell sindresorhus you should combine your grunt-sizediff features into grunt-compare-size instead of creating an nearly identical task
[12:45:38] <bot-t> rwaldron, Okay.
[12:46:19] <rwaldron> ?tell sindresorhus make PR, will land ASAP (gnarf needs the features)
[12:46:20] <bot-t> rwaldron, Okay.
[12:47:48] <gnarf> so - trying to think on how to best handle it
[12:47:56] <rwaldron> sindresorhus_ is that you?
[12:48:16] <gnarf> can grunt tasks receive command line params?
[12:48:17] <sindresorhus_> rwaldron: Hi :)
[12:48:26] <rwaldron> sindresorhus_ hey dude
[12:48:34] <rwaldron> here, lemme paste
[12:48:49] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: yes
[12:48:51] <rwaldron> sindresorhus_ "sindresorhus you should combine your grunt-sizediff features into grunt-compare-size instead of creating an nearly identical task"
[12:48:56] <gnarf> cuz it would be awesome to be able to do grunt compare_size --set-target
[12:49:00] <rwaldron> sindresorhus_ "sindresorhus make PR, will land ASAP (gnarf needs the features)"
[12:49:11] <gnarf> which would take the "current" stuff and make it the new "target"
[12:49:21] <rwaldron> gnarf it looks like sindresorhus_ has that in his sizediff
[12:49:27] <sindresorhus_> rwaldron: I thought about it, but it's too much change
[12:49:31] <rwaldron> so we should just combine efforts
[12:49:34] <rwaldron> how so?
[12:49:43] <gnarf> rwaldron: seems that sindresorhus_ still needs to specify a target in a config file
[12:49:45] <sindresorhus_> rwaldron: I use an other method to check the size
[12:50:02] <rwaldron> it's like... exactly hm.
[12:50:07] <rwaldron> whoops
[12:50:13] <rwaldron> ok
[12:50:20] <rwaldron> well gnarf knock yourself out
[12:50:22] <rwaldron> <3
[12:50:29] <sindresorhus_> gnarf: I've thought about being able to specify target in the CLI, but what is the usecase?
[12:50:33] <rwaldron> I need to finish a blog post about rebots
[12:50:38] <rwaldron> robots even
[12:51:08] <gnarf> sindresorhus_: I just checked out orkel/dis  because I want to make some minor mods to it - and want to use that original state as my size comparison target
[12:51:53] <sindresorhus_> gnarf: Ok, that sounds like something I would do too.
[12:52:06] <sindresorhus_> Will add it to my todo list
