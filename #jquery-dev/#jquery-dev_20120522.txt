[06:53:00] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (12.32s ago): fixes #11443 and fixes #11441 checkclone and appendchecked test failures in Chrome 19 and reliableMarginRight failures in Safari 5
[06:57:31] <mikesherov> bot-t: tell gibson042 that I wasn't trying to be negative about the pull request, sorry that I came across that way :-\
[06:57:32] <bot-t> mikesherov, Okay.
[06:57:48] <mikesherov> gibson042: you there?
[06:57:49] <gibson042> I'm here
[06:57:50] <bot-t> (18 secs ago) <mikesherov> tell gibson042 that I wasn't trying to be negative about the pull request, sorry that I came across that way :-\
[06:57:51] <gibson042> no worries
[06:58:00] <gibson042> I felt bad about duplicating your work
[06:58:14] <mikesherov> no, you should continue
[06:58:36] <mikesherov> I was just literally starting on it at that moment, and I saw the pull. I came across wrong.
[07:00:04] <gibson042> I didn't take it as negative at all
[07:00:06] <gibson042> we're cool :)
[07:00:49] <gibson042> do you know if there's a way to watch for pull requests, though?
[07:01:00] <mikesherov> follow :-)
[07:01:16] <mikesherov> Um, but no other way
[07:01:37] <gibson042> what are the steps for follow?
[07:01:51] <mikesherov> I mean, "watch" or "fork"
[07:01:54] <mikesherov> So you're going to continue working on that pull, I hope?
[07:02:07] <gibson042> yes
[07:02:28] <gibson042> which basically means that the css.js changes will be reverted
[07:03:28] <mikesherov> right, except the stuff you did with inlining some vars
[07:03:35] <mikesherov> ok, cool
[07:03:41] <mikesherov> I'll look for the changes
[07:03:46] <gibson042> have you had any problems with grunt compare_size?
[07:03:51] <mikesherov> no
[07:03:52] <gibson042> it's always showing no change
[07:03:59] <gibson042> hmmm, I'll dig a bit later
[07:04:05] <mikesherov> just go to master, run grunt once, and then go back to branch
[07:04:31] <mikesherov> css.js changes are a bit harder because of the time it takes to run perfs
[07:05:12] <DaveMethvin> hi guys
[07:05:19] <mikesherov> well, not harder, just more time consuming
[07:05:27] <mikesherov> hey DaveMethvin
[07:05:45] <gibson042> you're 100% right about the performance... I'm going to add a comment to that effect
[07:05:51] <gibson042> hi DaveMathvin
[07:06:26] <DaveMethvin> alright, let's fix those unit tests!

[07:18:42] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: following pulls are against 1.8pre, we should get rid of that as a pull target: http://jqbug.com/p776 http://jqbug.com/p774 http://jqbug.com/p786

[07:24:15] <mikesherov> no complaints from jenkins yet?
[07:24:15] <DaveMethvin> okay mikesherov, how do i prevent ppl from doing a pull against 1.8pre?  if github can do that it's not clear to me
[07:24:27] <mikesherov> delete the branch ;-)
[07:25:10] <DaveMethvin> helpful first aid tip from mikesherov: you can stop a nosebleed with a tourniquet around the neck
[07:25:12] <DaveMethvin> :D
[07:25:21] <mikesherov> LOL
[07:25:37] <mikesherov> is that really our head though?
[07:25:55] <DaveMethvin> well i suppose it's okay to remove, since it's fully merged into master and not squashed
[07:25:59] <mikesherov> other option is just tell orkel and gorey and rickard to resubmit
[07:26:07] <mikesherov> corey*
[07:26:11] <mikesherov> richard*
[07:26:23] <DaveMethvin> i can merge from them even if they went against 1.8pre
[07:26:43] <DaveMethvin> if they had to rebase due to conflicts i'd ask for a new pull i guess
[07:28:41] <mikesherov> sure
[07:28:44] <mikesherov> fair enough
[07:28:47] <mikesherov> nevermind then
[07:31:15] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, it's quiet around here ... *too* quiet
[07:31:22] <danheberden> KABOOM
[07:31:39] <DaveMethvin> i figured jenkins would be yelling at us by now
[07:31:48] <danheberden> totally just read that as jerkins
[07:31:54] <DaveMethvin> i like that better
[07:31:57] <gibson042> or trac
[07:32:11] <DaveMethvin> trac is like the crazy uncle you keep in the closet
[07:32:20] <DaveMethvin> you guys keep an uncle in the closet, right?
[07:32:34] <gibson042> why, did you hear a noise or something?
[07:32:38] <gibson042> probably just a large mouse
[07:33:01] <gibson042> ahem
[07:33:19] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin, you can always look at http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/
[07:33:57] <jzaefferer> and this tells you if it found a new commit: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/GitHubPollLog/?
[07:35:04] <DaveMethvin> how did i not know about that page jzaefferer? answer in a way that doesn't hurt my feelings. :D

[07:40:23] <mikesherov> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[07:41:14] <DaveMethvin> well that ain't our issue
[07:41:21] <mikesherov> how do I know?
[07:41:30] <mikesherov> how can I see what failed in that job?
[07:42:06] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/70/console
[07:42:20] <DaveMethvin> i dunno a direct way to it, i got there via the console output link
[07:42:50] <DaveMethvin> gotta run bbl
[09:25:21] <mikesherov> bot-t: tell Krinkle do you have any thoughts on if we can get test swarm to collect results for the various jQuery.support tests?
[09:25:22] <bot-t> mikesherov, Okay.
[09:25:53] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Did you see my suggestion?
[09:26:02] <mikesherov> no?
[09:26:29] <scott_gonzalez> Just create a page that shows you the results of $.support and visit it in each browser on BrowserStack.
[09:26:36] <scott_gonzalez> It's not like you care about the values after each commit.
[09:26:52] <mikesherov> sure
[09:26:57] <mikesherov> that makes sense
[09:27:00] <mikesherov> duh
[09:27:08] <scott_gonzalez> What day did you have that triage meeting?
[09:27:13] <mikesherov> Monday
[09:27:15] <scott_gonzalez> I created a simple jsbin
[09:27:20] <scott_gonzalez> I'll go find the logs.
[09:27:24] <mikesherov> great
[09:27:25] <mikesherov> thanks
[09:28:08] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsbin.com/axenup/
[09:28:38] <scott_gonzalez> You'll need to add json2 to get it to work in oldIE.
[09:29:17] <scott_gonzalez> Are all of the tests written such that false is "bad"?
[09:29:26] <scott_gonzalez> If so, you could just loop through and output the false values.
[09:29:33] <mikesherov> no, they're not
[09:29:37] <scott_gonzalez> Didn't think so.
[09:29:56] <mikesherov> and actually, what I care about is aggregation
[09:30:15] <mikesherov> just running this for each browser to see if any support tests are no longer needed
[09:30:18] <scott_gonzalez> Right, which browsers stand out from the rest.
[09:31:05] <mikesherov> although, I think I can whip something up that collects this data into a DB
[09:31:06] <scott_gonzalez> I was originally thinking you could create a page that POSTs those values to a server, then have a script that finds the discrepencies.
[09:31:11] <mikesherov> right
[09:31:24] <scott_gonzalez> But then I thought there are so few browsres and this is likely a one time thing.
[09:31:38] <mikesherov> well, ideally, I'd run it once a month
[09:31:55] <scott_gonzalez> You could do it pretty easily in node :-)
[09:32:02] <mikesherov> and I thought it'd be great for testswarm, because that's the canonical source of truth of browsers to test in
[09:32:07] <scott_gonzalez> Just dump out the results to a .json file, named based on the UA string.
[09:32:12] <mikesherov> I can use browserling!
[09:32:57] <mikesherov> http://testling.com/browsers/
[09:38:21] <snover> DaveMethvin: do you know if ie10 is going to support foreignObject in svg?
[09:39:20] <DaveMethvin> snover: i haven't looked but something tells me no
[09:39:48] <snover> haha, spidey sense?
[09:42:57] <DaveMethvin> snover: this page seems to confirm it http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh834675(v=vs.85).aspx
[09:43:02] <DaveMethvin> i hadn't seen it in the preview
[09:43:24] <snover> DaveMethvin: confirms it won’t be there you mean?
[09:43:33] <DaveMethvin> right, see the bottom of the page
[09:43:42] <snover> © 2012 Mi…oh
[09:43:43] <DaveMethvin> at this point i think you can consider ie10 feature complete
[09:43:46] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:44:02] <DaveMethvin> who knows, maybe they'll throw in something at the last minute but i doubt it
[09:44:42] <snover> it would seem like kind of a big feature to throw in at the last minute
[09:44:48] <DaveMethvin> exactly
[09:45:16] <DaveMethvin> my guess is that we'll see final around september-october
[09:45:27] <mikesherov> hooray
[09:45:46] <DaveMethvin> ie9 just passed ie8 like, what, last week?
[09:46:20] <snover> would’ve passed sooner but everyone has to upgrade from xp to get it :)
[09:46:34] <DaveMethvin> i think the ie guys are going to need to change their release process if they plan to stay anywhere close to the other browsers
[09:47:30] <DaveMethvin> so if the feature set for ie10 is nailed down mid-2012 and it's released late 2012 and nobody is force-upgraded until mid-2013 ... well you get the idea
[09:48:38] <DaveMethvin> meanwhile we'll be on chrome 29 and firefox 21
[09:48:53] <snover> DaveMethvin: the only reason I’d think that FO would make it would be because it was called out specifically in some article about how IE9 is not a modern browser
[09:48:58] <snover> from the moz people
[09:49:00] <snover> way back when
[09:49:09] <snover> “the 20 ways that IE9 is not as modern as firefox” or whatever
[09:50:03] <DaveMethvin> i think it's more likely they'll implement -webkit- css support first, since there is lots of installed base for that
[10:47:04] <scott_gonzalez> Oh gzip, you're so silly.
[10:47:20] <scott_gonzalez>     420188       (-16)  dist/jquery-ui.js
[10:47:20] <scott_gonzalez>     226092       (+59)  dist/jquery-ui.min.js
[10:47:20] <scott_gonzalez>      59049       (-24)  dist/jquery-ui.min.js.gz
[10:47:49] <scott_gonzalez> We used to do a lot of `var self = this` in UI since self can be munged, but this can't.
[10:48:07] <scott_gonzalez> That is from changing self back to this in one file.
[10:59:17] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Ah nice
[10:59:18] <bot-t> (1 hour 33 mins ago) <mikesherov> tell Krinkle do you have any thoughts on if we can get test swarm to collect results for the various jQuery.support tests?
[10:59:42] <Krinkle> gzip can work with any dictionary items it wants, not limited by javascript meaning
[10:59:44] <Krinkle> nice
[11:00:17] <Krinkle> ?tell mikesherov I read the conversation after you ?tell'ed me. Does your question still stand?
[11:00:17] <bot-t> Krinkle, Okay.
[11:01:19] <jqcommit> [testswarm] Krinkle pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/HppHIg
[11:01:19] <jqcommit> [testswarm/master] Rename About page to Info page - Timo Tijhof
[11:14:31] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: how do you feel about making single quotes the standard in jquery/testswarm?
[11:15:05] <Krinkle> I noticed it is using a lot of single quotes (my bad), and heard that numerous jquery devs prefer this as well (jquery core is using doubles for legacy)
[11:15:39] <Krinkle> in PHP there is a difference (contrary to javascript) in performance. Not a lot but single quotes are not parsed with magic replacements fetchers, just literal impression
[11:20:53] <snover> then you will confuse all the java developers ! :(
[11:28:02] <Krinkle> snover: elaborate?
[11:28:08] <snover> Krinkle: strings in java are "
[11:28:54] <Krinkle> A wise men once said that one of the most important things in programming is to work according to the details of the language you are working in. What applies to other languages, habbits, prettyness or emotions have no place.
[11:29:37] <snover> ok, apparently you don’t understand my sarcasm :)
[11:29:41] <Krinkle> (freely cited from Douglas Crockford by the way - in a passage where he talks about people using habits that have justification in other languages and applying them inappropriately in javascript)
[11:29:53] <Krinkle> snover: I did suspect it but wasn't sure. it's hard to detect over a wire
[11:31:05] <scott_gonzalez> Single quotes in PHP are fine.
[11:31:13] <scott_gonzalez> We do that in our WordPress extensions.
[11:31:32] <Krinkle> yeah, it is a whole other question why we are using javascript conventions as base for php code
[11:31:38] <Krinkle> I'll remove that passage from the testswarm wiki
[11:47:16] <David_Souther> krinkle: [Insert Steve McConnell quote about programming into a language]
[11:48:06] <Krinkle> :)
[11:48:36] <David_Souther> I'd find an actual quote but I'm too lazy to actually open the copy of code complete sitting next to me.
[12:02:31] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: you around? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/774 -- chattin w/ @orkel about it, I wonder why our `:hidden` selector isn't as simple as his `isHidden`

[12:04:48] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: I am just wondering if our definition of ":hidden" shouldn't be updated to reflect his research on hidden/disconnected elements
[12:05:13] <gnarf> We had :hidden to support stuff in effects AFAIK
[12:05:43] <gnarf> I would also like jQuery UI to be able to do the same "hidden" detection as effects core...
[12:05:52] <gnarf> *shrug*
[12:06:07] <gnarf> I gotta run - meeting here, just wanted to bring up the conversation topic - continue on the pull maybe?

[15:34:51] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on grunt by johnbender (37.158s ago): Configure Phantomjs/Qunit test timeout value
[15:34:58] <johnbender> I know you are busy guy
[15:35:16] <johnbender> but that's there when you can get to it
[15:35:32] <ben_alman> k
[15:35:46] <ben_alman> it seems like this is less a generic phantomjs timeout issue
[15:35:54] <ben_alman> and more of a qunit-specific timeout issue
[15:36:14] <ben_alman> as such, i don't think it makes sense to create a global timeout value for phantomjs
[15:36:15] <johnbender> ben_alman: yes! but I'm not clear how to set up the config setup for a multitask like that
[15:36:21] <johnbender> :(
[15:36:27] <johnbender> that's in the pr as a caveat
[15:36:46] <johnbender> appologies if that is obvious
[15:37:20] <ben_alman> what are you doing in your tests that you need a longer timeout?
[15:37:34] <johnbender> ben_alman: they're all click and wait
[15:37:44] <ben_alman> wait for what
[15:37:49] <johnbender> "integration", "uat" etc
[15:37:53] <johnbender> ben_alman: well in a lot of cases
[15:37:56] <johnbender> animationComplete
[15:38:06] <ben_alman> and the animation takes more than 5 seconds?
[15:38:08] <johnbender> no
[15:38:14] <johnbender> but the test can in aggregate
[15:38:20] <johnbender> apparently
[15:38:22] <johnbender> :D
[15:38:25] <ben_alman> why not have smaller, more atomic tests
[15:38:49] <johnbender> ben_alman: hmm, well a lot of times it's not that simple
[15:39:07] <johnbender> in our case we have a specific set of actions, in some cases, that we need to test against
[15:39:19] <johnbender> for instance certain combinations of history manipulations cause issues with the library
[15:39:22] <johnbender> that we want to check for
[15:39:45] <ben_alman> in those cases why not use faster animations so it takes less time
[15:40:36] <johnbender> ben_alman: so, alter the code for the sake of the tests?
[15:40:41] <ben_alman> no
[15:40:55] <ben_alman> you already allow for adjustable animation speeds, right?
[15:40:59] <johnbender> no
[15:41:09] <johnbender> not that I'm aware of
[15:41:12] <ben_alman> nobody's ever asked for that?
[15:41:15] <johnbender> nope
[15:41:22] <johnbender> I'm not even sure how that work with css
[15:41:27] * johnbender doesn't know shit about css
[15:41:28] <ben_alman> gotcha
[15:41:49] <ben_alman> must make testing a real pain, having to wait for all these transitions
[15:41:58] <johnbender> ben_alman: you ... have ... no ... idea
[15:42:07] <ben_alman> maybe you want to look into making it faster
[15:42:08] <ben_alman> for sanity
[15:42:31] <ben_alman> add a class to the html element called TEST-OMG-FASTER that makes all animations take 0.1s
[15:42:35] <ben_alman> or something
[15:42:40] <ben_alman> just an idea anyways
[15:42:56] <johnbender> ben_alman: we've talked about disabling the animations for the tests but again, that's altering the behavior of the library for the sake of the tests
[15:43:03] <ben_alman> don't disable them
[15:43:06] <ben_alman> just make them faster
[15:43:09] <johnbender> either way
[15:43:20] <johnbender> it's the same issue
[15:43:30] <ben_alman> the timeout of 5 seconds is really an "oh shit, something exploded"
[15:43:34] <johnbender> but we are in agreement that it would benice
[15:43:44] <johnbender> we have long complex interaction tests
[15:43:55] <johnbender> they aren't unit tests
[15:44:06] <johnbender> they are uat tests
[15:44:24] <ben_alman> is it common for these kind of tests to take more than 5 seconds?
[15:44:27] <ben_alman> like, in general?
[15:44:27] <johnbender> yes
[15:44:29] <ben_alman> ok
[15:44:43] <johnbender> the idea being that the tests aren't tied to the underlying implementation
[15:44:49] <johnbender> only the user interaction and expected results
[15:44:53] <ben_alman> well
[15:45:06] <ben_alman> i know what you mean, anyways
[15:45:17] <ben_alman> i'll have to figure out how to parameterize that timeout value
[15:45:19] <ben_alman> no idea how atm
[15:45:28] <johnbender> ben_alman: that would be a massive help
[15:45:42] <johnbender> so I'm right in that the multitask can only accept certain types of config params then?
[15:45:50] <johnbender> I wasn't sure about that
[15:45:54] <ben_alman> whatever the task is configured to accept
[15:46:02] <ben_alman> in this case, just a list of file paths
[15:46:07] <ben_alman> or wildcards
[15:46:11] <johnbender> ok
[15:46:18] <johnbender> ben_alman: well thanks for taking the time to take a look
[15:46:22] <johnbender> I really really appreciate it
[15:46:26] <johnbender> let me know if you get around to it
[15:46:33] <ben_alman> i'll try ot get this in there but it won't be until at least 0.5
[15:46:38] <ben_alman> so at least a month
[15:46:43] <johnbender> ben_alman: kk
[15:46:51] <johnbender> I'll sort something out in the meantiem
[15:46:54] <johnbender> *meantime
[15:47:07] <ben_alman> what you can do in the meantime
[15:47:15] <ben_alman> if you want to use an official unmodified grunt
[15:47:23] <johnbender> can you define a git repo in package.json or some such?
[15:47:37] <johnbender> sorry
[15:47:39] <johnbender> go ahead
[15:47:48] <ben_alman> is to create a directory next to the gruntfile called (for example) "grunt"
[15:48:32] <ben_alman> then inside that, create a grunt/tasks/qunit/phantom.js file
[15:48:45] <ben_alman> copying over the existing same-named file inside of grunt
[15:48:54] <ben_alman> and changing the timeout
[15:49:28] <ben_alman> hard-coding it
[15:49:30] <johnbender> ben_alman: nice
[15:49:31] <ben_alman> then in your gruntfile
[15:49:40] <ben_alman> do grunt.loadTasks('grunt');
[15:49:58] <ben_alman> and that phantom.js file should override the built-in grunt one
[15:50:33] <ben_alman> afk
[15:52:22] <johnbender> ben_alman: noted, and thanks again
[15:59:58] <johnbender> ben_alman: I already have a subdir for the build tasks and I dumped it in there. Worked perfect! Thanks so much for you help
[16:00:05] <johnbender> *your help

[19:47:41] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Who operates that bot?
[19:48:11] <Krinkle> nickserv doesn't yield much useful info
[19:48:18] <Krinkle> [04:48am] NickServ: Information on bot-t (account bot-t):
[19:48:18] <Krinkle> [04:48am] NickServ: Last addr  : ~bot-t@unaffiliated/temp01/bot/bot-t
[19:48:19] <Krinkle> [04:48am] NickServ: Metadata  : URL = http://bot-t.com/
[20:00:52] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle: i think it may be temp01 ... maybe ajpiano knows who owns bot-t?
[20:01:22] <Krinkle> temp01 is a known user ?
[20:01:40] <Krinkle> Ah, right> i remember seeing that nickname in the past.
