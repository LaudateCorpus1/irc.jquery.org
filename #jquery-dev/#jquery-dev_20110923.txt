[00:08:25] <jaubourg> hello there
[00:10:46] <addyosmani> bonjour monsieur jaubourg :D
[00:19:02] <jaubourg> hello Mr Addy
[00:19:35] <addyosmani> hellloo
[00:19:46] <addyosmani> wow. I'm late for work.
[00:19:49] <addyosmani> better run!
[05:09:58] <jaubourg> boaz: you around?
[05:58:10] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: In case you missed it jQuery Mobile 1.0 RC1 coming next week: http://t.co/HqVocAyn ★ http://bit.ly/nfeJCv
[06:11:35] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/khEkaQ
[06:11:35] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Simplify the `.closest(Array)` code since we no longer use it internally. - Dave Methvin
[06:30:18] <jaubourg> hey Dave
[06:31:29] <DaveMethvin> hey jaubourg
[06:31:49] <DaveMethvin> so qunit is making our life hard
[06:33:24] <timmywil> it's good to know it wasn't $.Callbacks
[06:35:17] <timmywil> not that we've ruled out a problem with deferreds, because it seems to me that the start function does not rely on context
[06:37:26] <jaubourg> yeah, same here
[06:37:32] <jaubourg> no clue really
[06:37:43] <jaubourg> looks like IE7 being IE7
[06:37:59] <timmywil> there was a change to stop's arguments and config.semaphore
[06:38:28] <timmywil> so if config.semaphore is never reaching 0, start will not do anything except reduce the semaphore
[06:38:53] <timmywil> but i don't see an extra stop call just previous of the hanging test
[06:38:58] <jaubourg> but why on Earth would having the deferred as context cause a problem only in IE7?
[06:39:18] <timmywil> yea, idk, im just thinking out loud
[06:46:32] <DaveMethvin> to understand ie7 you have to be insane like ie7
[06:47:22] <DaveMethvin> btw it's a busy day for me so i might not be around much ... i have a few commits i want to make to trim down size but they will probably not happen until tonight or the weekend
[06:58:37] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin does that mean dean edwards is insane?
[06:58:54] <rwaldron> that would explain his absense from the "spotlight" in recent years
[06:59:03] <rwaldron> he's locked up at Arkham
[08:16:27] <ajpiano> we don't support quirksmode, right
[08:16:55] <ajpiano> timmywil: ping?
[08:19:48] <timmywil> ajpiano: i would take a look at a quirksmode bug, but no, we don't actively support quirksmode
[08:20:04] <ajpiano> timmywil: then docs#10262 is all kinds of invalid
[08:20:05] <bot-t> timmywil, [#10262] Empty attributes gives undefined! (pending bug) - http://jqbug.com/10262
[08:20:19] <ajpiano> dude is complaining that it doesn't work only when he *doesn't* have a doctype
[08:20:30] <ajpiano> and he's including the script *after* the closing </html>
[08:20:45] <ajpiano> invalid/wontfix
[08:21:12] <ajpiano> so it's like, would you like a scoop of "doing stupid stuff" with that "self-righteousness"
[08:21:14] <ajpiano> :/
[08:21:16] <timmywil> well, hey. i didn't catch that. isn't anything outside of <html> invalid regardless?
[08:21:47] <ajpiano> yah... but the script after </html> apparently works right when there is a doctype
[08:21:51] <ajpiano> according to what he's describing
[08:22:00] <timmywil> weird
[08:22:03] <ajpiano> but either way, it's really dumb to have things after </html>
[08:22:12] <timmywil> yea
[08:23:02] <ajpiano> "I am a developer with 18 years of experience of doin it rong"
[08:23:08] <timmywil> hehe
[08:25:03] <ajpiano> also i like how he believes in the jquery community but believes that standards that have been generated completley by and in the interest of the community are onerous and complicated
[08:25:08] <ajpiano> w/e
[08:25:09] <ajpiano> i should work
[08:25:09] <ajpiano> :p
[08:26:41] <timmywil> ajpiano: i closed :)
[08:27:12] <ajpiano> thanks mr wil
[08:27:16] <timmywil> i refuse to believe a real attributes bug can't be reproduced on jsfiddle.
[08:27:51] <ajpiano> if it can't be
[08:27:57] <ajpiano> upload a bloody page and link us to it
[08:28:05] <timmywil> true dat
[08:28:09] <ajpiano> don't be like "create this invalid html document yourself in notepad as an aspx page"
[08:28:11] <ajpiano> :/
[08:28:20] <timmywil> haha, srsly
[08:29:54] <ajpiano> or you can just stick to 1.6.2
[08:30:15] <ajpiano> the magical release that supports both requestAnimationFrame and horribly invalid, doctypeless html in IE8
[08:30:49] <timmywil> it is pretty magical
[10:06:21] <ajpiano> rwaldron: there?
[10:06:32] <rwaldron> am
[10:06:41] <ajpiano> dude in #jquery having trubs with see #9560
[10:06:46] <ajpiano> ?9560
[10:06:47] <bot-t> [#9560] Null function getAttribute is invoked in acceptData() (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/9560
[10:06:56] <ajpiano> was curious if you had insights
[10:07:16] <rwaldron> lemme look
[10:07:49] <rwaldron> ajpiano does dude have a fiddle? or a test case i can look at?
[10:08:13] <rwaldron> I reopened... interesting!
[10:08:17] <ajpiano> yea exactly
[10:08:21] <ajpiano> that's why he asked after you
[10:08:22] <rwaldron> oh snap
[10:08:23] <rwaldron> i know why
[10:08:27] <rwaldron> shiiiit
[10:08:29] <ajpiano> he was like "it would be nice if i could talk to rwaldron"
[10:08:33] <rwaldron> BLOCKER
[10:08:45] <rwaldron> pfft
[10:08:47] <rwaldron> hahahah
[10:08:49] <rwaldron> did not!
[10:09:21] <rwaldron> ajpiano i jsut updated this to a blocker for 1.7
[10:09:24] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ^^
[10:09:45] <DaveMethvin> 9560?
[10:09:48] <rwaldron> tl;dr... yeah
[10:09:51] <rwaldron> ahahah
[10:09:52] <rwaldron> whoops
[10:10:08] <DaveMethvin> well we ain't fixin it unless we take out bytes :P
[10:10:16] <rwaldron> I'll see what I can do
[10:10:22] <DaveMethvin> doesn't look like we ever got a test case?
[10:10:30] <rwaldron> no
[10:10:33] <rwaldron> but this is a problem
[10:10:39] <rwaldron> I wanna try to tackle this
[10:10:41] <DaveMethvin> usually bugs are like that
[10:10:46] <rwaldron> :P
[10:11:04] <rwaldron> oh wait
[10:11:46] <DaveMethvin> it woulda been nice if the stack trace was on an uncompressed jquery
[10:12:03] <ajpiano> i asked the guy to come here
[10:12:12] <ajpiano> i think he can make a testcase
[10:12:27] <ajpiano> boom
[10:12:30] <ajpiano> there he is
[10:12:34] <samuelcole> ajpiano: hi
[10:12:51] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin craves your stack trace, samuelcole
[10:13:06] <samuelcole> ok, cool
[10:13:19] <DaveMethvin> yeah, a test case would be good but even a stack trace on an uncompressed jquery woudl be better
[10:13:23] <samuelcole> double fisting laptops right now, let me see...
[10:13:39] <samuelcole> oh, hmm, i can only repro with my compressed js
[10:13:53] <DaveMethvin> heisenbug
[10:14:07] <DaveMethvin> which version of jquery was that?
[10:14:27] <samuelcole> 1.6.1
[10:15:05] <DaveMethvin> i gotta wonder if it's somethign we already fixed
[10:15:19] <DaveMethvin> what's the most recent post on the ticket, lemme check
[10:15:35] <samuelcole> rwaldron reopened it 6 weeks ago
[10:16:22] <samuelcole> this is IE9, btw
[10:16:32] <rwaldron> samuelcole is this accurate: http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/MPGjC/
[10:17:16] <samuelcole> let's see
[10:18:23] <samuelcole> hmm, that doesn't throw an exception
[10:18:33] <samuelcole> it might be an interaction with swfobject or swfupload
[10:18:51] <DaveMethvin> there was another fiddle in the ticket, it works for me as well
[10:18:51] <rwaldron> might be that I'm an idiot and used the wrong classid
[10:18:53] <rwaldron> hahahaha
[10:19:13] <rwaldron> swfobject will result in something much differnt then what i used
[10:19:14] <rwaldron> sorry
[10:19:57] <samuelcole> yeah, it sounds like both me and the bug reporter are using swfobject
[10:20:38] <DaveMethvin> which is interesting b/c swfobject is a special case that we let through the .data()-on-object embargo
[10:20:55] <DaveMethvin> so maybe on ie9 it breaks like all the other objects that can't have data
[10:21:23] <DaveMethvin> but if that's the case i am not sure what to do, unless we say it cannot have data anymore
[10:21:30] <DaveMethvin> which will break a lot of stuff i suspect
[10:21:58] <DaveMethvin> well let's see if rwaldron comes up with a good test case, that will make it clear which way we can go
[10:22:37] <rwaldron> http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/yfkWW/
[10:23:33] <samuelcole> that doesn't throw an exception
[10:24:16] <rwaldron> ok
[10:24:18] <rwaldron> your turn
[10:24:20] <rwaldron> :)
[10:24:31] <rwaldron> can you make something similar that throws an exception?
[10:24:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah, like that but with a bug :P
[10:25:00] <samuelcole> yeah, those jsfiddle's would have been my first guesses too :-(
[10:25:17] <DaveMethvin> no pressure samuelcole, the select box is set to WORKSFORME and my finger is hovering over submit :P
[10:25:19] <samuelcole> now i'm thinking swfobject… i'm also seeing a query ui call in the callstack
[10:25:28] <samuelcole> ohhhhh nooo
[10:25:35] <DaveMethvin> lol
[10:25:42] <samuelcole> i shouldn't have said anything in irc
[10:26:15] <DaveMethvin> well quite a few people posted me-too on that ticket but without a repro it's hard to tell what's going on
[10:26:51] <samuelcole> let me look at my exception again...
[10:26:57] <DaveMethvin> samuelcole: is it possible that maybe flash wasn't installed at the time?
[10:27:08] <DaveMethvin> just tryna think of permutations
[10:27:22] <samuelcole> this machine definitely has flash
[10:27:24] <DaveMethvin> or maybe it was one particular version of flash that has a problem
[10:27:32] <DaveMethvin> they put new ones out three times a day
[10:27:47] <samuelcole> ha, yeah, i just got an update today
[10:28:37] <samuelcole> ok, so the actual problem is that getAttribute is null
[10:35:44] <rwaldron> samuelcole I'm glad you did bring it up
[10:35:50] <rwaldron> that makes sense
[10:36:00] <rwaldron> because sometimes IE is retarded
[10:36:07] <samuelcole> still trying to build a reduction
[10:36:13] <samuelcole> so a whole bunch of things are null
[10:36:18] <samuelcole> in the inspector
[10:36:19] <rwaldron> and doesnt think that "object" elements are really dom nodes
[10:36:22] <samuelcole> it's super weird
[10:36:24] <rwaldron> how about...
[10:36:25] <DaveMethvin> well we know elem (or 'a' as it's known in the stack trace) is a real node because elem.nodeName is truthy
[10:36:59] <rwaldron> ( "getAttribute" in document.querySelectorAll("object")[0] )
[10:37:03] <rwaldron> samuelcole ^
[10:38:10] <samuelcole> run that on my broken page?
[10:39:14] <DaveMethvin> can't hurt
[10:39:30] <samuelcole> comes back true
[10:40:00] <DaveMethvin> how about the same but "object" in place of "getAttribute"
[10:40:03] <samuelcole> but it's in the object, it's just set to null
[10:40:18] <DaveMethvin> oh is the value null?
[10:40:25] <samuelcole> yeah
[10:40:32] <DaveMethvin> well there's your problem right there
[10:40:36] <samuelcole> a whole bunch of values in the object is null
[10:40:38] <DaveMethvin> how the heck did that happen?
[10:40:38] <samuelcole> ha, yeah
[10:40:45] <samuelcole> that's the question
[10:40:56] <DaveMethvin> well *I* didn't do it. :P
[10:41:02] <samuelcole> hmmmm
[10:41:11] <samuelcole> you're lookin kinda guilty
[10:41:27] * DaveMethvin takes hand out of cookie jar
[10:43:07] <samuelcole> ah, so it's null on page load too
[10:43:17] <DaveMethvin> so before jquery messed with it?
[10:43:39] <DaveMethvin> so we can rule out any manipulation UI or core might do with clone() and the like?
[10:43:49] <samuelcole> not sure about that, but before i thought it was related to removing the object, and i guess that's not true
[10:47:27] <samuelcole> ho ho
[10:47:31] <samuelcole> looks like the same bug
[10:47:34] <samuelcole> http://code.google.com/p/swfupload/issues/detail?id=348#c0
[10:47:43] <samuelcole> swfupload is removing all JS functions
[10:47:51] <samuelcole> DaveMethvin is off the hook
[10:48:16] <DaveMethvin> hmm, interesting
[10:48:23] <DaveMethvin> knew we could blame flash eventually
[10:49:11] <samuelcole> found it!
[10:49:14] <samuelcole> stupid swfupload
[10:49:23] <DaveMethvin> ok, so how about i close that as a cantfix and put a link to that page? samuelcole rwaldron
[10:49:43] <samuelcole> yeah
[10:49:54] <DaveMethvin> i don't think we can reasonably do a workaround, and you can always edit your swfupload like you're doing
[10:50:19] <samuelcole> just curious: you aren't interested in just doing a null check?
[10:50:28] <rwaldron> dunzp
[10:50:30] <samuelcole> (i don't know how that code works)
[10:50:31] <rwaldron> dunzo*
[10:50:51] <samuelcole> ha
[10:50:52] <samuelcole> 			this.debug("Removing Flash functions hooks (this should only run in IE and should prevent memory leaks)");
[10:51:00] <samuelcole> thanks guys!
[10:51:02] <rwaldron> samuelcole it makes sense to normalize for browsers
[10:51:12] <rwaldron> but not for libs that do messed up shit!
[10:51:13] <rwaldron> :D
[10:51:17] <samuelcole> not for other weirdo libraries
[10:51:18] <samuelcole> ha, right
[10:51:18] <rwaldron> thanks for your help on that
[10:51:36] <samuelcole> no problem
[10:52:08] <DaveMethvin> getting us closer to our goal of zarro bugs
[10:53:30] <eddiemonge> danheberden: around?
[10:57:10] <eddiemonge> anyone remember if the cdn served up https versions before? i want to say it did
[11:05:49] <rwaldron> eddiemonge no
[11:06:06] <rwaldron> http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js doesnt have https
[11:09:04] <eddiemonge> really felt like it did. it should.
[11:10:22] <rwaldron> that costs money and require maintenance
[11:10:32] <rwaldron> google apis gives it away for free
[11:11:29] <eddiemonge> with that logic, why even host our own cdn?
[11:23:53] <rwaldron> JohnResig ^^ ?
[11:24:00] <rwaldron> maybe john knows?
[11:33:20] <JohnResig> it's good to provide an alternative - one that we control, where we don't track the users, and know it won't go away
[11:33:56] <rwaldron> thanks JohnResig :)
[11:34:13] <eddiemonge> so does that mean https should work as well?
[11:35:35] <JohnResig> no idea
[11:35:43] <JohnResig> I don't ever remember there being an https option
[11:35:51] <JohnResig> or are you asking if it SHOLD work in the futuer?
[11:35:53] <JohnResig> *future
[11:36:11] <eddiemonge> i thought there was
[11:36:33] <eddiemonge> and i think it should work now and in the future or else we are just delivering a half baked solution
[11:37:44] <eddiemonge> without it is basically telling users: "yeah go ahead and use the official jquery cdn but if you have a secure site you will need to use a different cdn, in which case, it would probably be better to not even use the jquery cdn"
[11:38:10] <ajpiano> i don't think there's anything wrong with telling users that....
[11:38:14] <ajpiano> given the overhead of maintaining it
[11:41:51] <eddiemonge> guess its a non-issue anyway: Do you offer SSL with ProCDN?
[11:41:51] <eddiemonge> Not yet. We know that this is important to our users and it’s on our roadmap.
[11:42:46] <ajpiano> lol another quirksmode only IE bug
[11:43:00] <DaveMethvin> lalallalalall i can't hear you ajpiano
[11:48:17] <rwaldron> eddiemonge "else we are just delivering a half baked solution" ... that's not very nice.
[11:48:51] <rwaldron> also, you know better then to file duplicates
[11:52:08] <eddiemonge> yeah i should have commented on 10142 but it is closed and i wanted to make sure i followed up on this issue
[11:54:57] <eddiemonge> and i guess its not jquery's fault that mediatemple hasnt implemented ssl on their cdn yet even though edgecast supports its
[12:13:36] <rwaldron> timmywil DaveMethvin either there?
[12:13:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[12:13:57] <rwaldron> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/516 is invalid
[12:13:57] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by hooper (1h, 9m ago): New method for validating JSON strings
[12:14:09] <rwaldron> they filed this: as well... http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10336
[12:14:13] <rwaldron> I've closed the ticket
[12:15:07] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: we definitely don't need a lot of extra code just to handle IE6/7
[12:15:10] <DaveMethvin> amirite?
[12:15:16] <DaveMethvin> everyone else has JSON.parse
[12:15:17] <rwaldron> totallyrite
[12:15:27] <DaveMethvin> k well imma close it
[12:16:00] <rwaldron> this patch is negligent
[12:16:09] <rwaldron> wtf is wrong with people?
[12:36:26] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin what is left to do with event prop hooks?
[12:36:32] <rwaldron> are you gonna take it from last night?
[12:37:02] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah i guess so ... i was tryna think of a more elegant way of doing the calls
[12:37:13] <DaveMethvin> also we don't want to split each time the fn is callled
[12:37:16] <DaveMethvin> since that's at event time
[12:37:35] <DaveMethvin> i gues it could be a closure var
[12:37:56] <DaveMethvin> did you have a perf made for it already? i wanted to try a few variations
[12:43:39] <rwaldron> oh, no.. nothing up to date
[12:44:30] <DaveMethvin> i'll prolly just make up something fake that calls .fix
[12:44:45] <DaveMethvin> it's so hard to perf test honestly
[12:45:01] <DaveMethvin> but i want to be sure i don't slow it too much
[12:45:17] <DaveMethvin> the fact that you've moved a bunch of props into the hooks should help a lot of cases
[12:45:59] <rwaldron> just updated
[12:46:11] <rwaldron> branch I'm in is "8789-fun-with-fix"
[12:46:33] <rwaldron> I moved the mouse props to a closure wide var called "mouseProps" that splits the string
[12:52:42] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i think adding the possibility to stop a single queue is worth the ~20 bytes it might save :)
[12:53:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah agreed, i was hoping the bytes were more feature and less bug
[12:55:01] <gnarf> nah, mostly the feature, it added the ability to stop things that couldn't be stopped before.... I expected a little bit of an increase
[12:55:38] <gnarf> I'll look for more ways to golf it though
[12:56:02] <DaveMethvin> really the best time to lose lotsa bytes is in major refactors anyway, otherwise it's just nip and tuck
[12:56:25] <gnarf> i don't wanna be responsible for eating up all the bytes everyone else is saving :(
[12:56:39] <DaveMethvin> OM NOM NOM
[12:57:11] <gnarf> my question
[12:57:24] <gnarf> do you think its worth having the expand functions be able to handle "10px 20px"
[12:57:41] <DaveMethvin> i dunno
[12:58:00] <DaveMethvin> maybe that could wait for 1.8? i know we do get requests for it
[12:58:03] <gnarf> saves 60 bytes mined, 29 gziped to remove it
[12:58:18] <gnarf> .css("margin", "10px 20px") works by nature of setting the style
[12:58:23] <DaveMethvin> oh heck i guess it's not worth agonizing on it
[12:58:32] <DaveMethvin> one more slice of pie won't hurt
[12:58:36] <DaveMethvin> :P
[12:58:41] <gnarf> :)
[12:58:45] <DaveMethvin> sure why not
[12:58:52] <gnarf> also, re parts not being defined
[12:59:00] <gnarf> you put that comment in the middle of a var statment
[12:59:02] <gnarf> ...
[12:59:09] <DaveMethvin> no, really?

[13:33:31] <gnarf> RE: the type check
[13:33:38] <timmywil> regarding https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/515
[13:33:39] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by louisremi (3h, 30m ago): Fix #7641: .animate() should accept "auto" and "" (empty string) values
[13:33:55] <timmywil> I seem to remember louis changing my mind on this, but I can't remember why
[13:34:09] <timmywil> I feel like these shouldn't be supported if they can't be fully supported
[13:34:24] <timmywil> which they can't
[13:34:49] <gnarf> even the browser doesn't support animating to auto in css3
[13:35:24] <gnarf> and DaveMethvin i was just going based off the style guide which said jQuery.type( string ) === "string" was the type check for string
[13:36:00] <timmywil> that seems a little unnecessary
[13:36:35] <gnarf> er
[13:36:38] <gnarf> i guess i was wrong
[13:36:40] <gnarf> i dunno why i did
[13:36:42] <gnarf> fixing
