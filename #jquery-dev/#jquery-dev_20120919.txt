[05:35:16] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquery: jQuery returns to the UK on 19 April 2013 in Oxford, England! Learn more now here http://t.co/SshnkNDi and follow @jquk for updates! ★ http://bit.ly/OECdmE
[07:20:36] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: pretty sure those wiki edits are from the david mark camp
[07:20:45] <DaveMethvin> yeah i figured
[07:20:55] <DaveMethvin> i need to put the page on my watchlist
[07:21:47] <ajpiano> it's literally mind blowing that he spends all day every day bloviating on twitter
[07:22:19] <ajpiano> https://twitter.com/Cinsoft/status/247514283620061186
[07:22:21] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from Cinsoft: Cross-browser coding gives best shot for a stable/finished project. Multi-browser ensures endless instability, patching, do-overs, etc. #js ★ http://bit.ly/T3QATj
[07:27:08] <ajpiano> and his recent ramblings have featured a common theme of dealing with wikipedia as way to rectify...whatever it is he's trying to rectify
[07:31:08] <ajpiano> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-browser
[07:38:08] <ajpiano> so um gnarf danheberden or anyone
[07:38:17] <ajpiano> we should figure out what's wrong with the damn tutorials page
[08:02:35] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano gnarf danheberden is there a way to just replace the tutorials page with a "This page is obsolete and has been removed"  perhaps
[08:02:54] <jqcommit> [docs.jquery.com] Krinkle force-pushed master from b9dfd8f to 1f2a2ce: http://git.io/PwehWQ
[08:02:54] <jqcommit> [docs.jquery.com/master] Sync misc changes - Timo Tijhof
[08:03:10] <DaveMethvin> it would be great to redirect it to learn.jquery.com but barring that we need to do something to avoid all these dup tix
[08:03:46] <DaveMethvin> uh oh, forceeee pusssssh! Krinkle's in trooouble!
[08:03:52] <DaveMethvin> :P
[08:04:13] <Krinkle> meh, removing some sensitive stuff from the history
[08:04:23] <DaveMethvin> oh well in that case, carry on!
[08:04:27] <Krinkle> which is only sensitive to people with a time machine, but whatever.
[08:04:36] <Krinkle> I changed the password anyway.
[08:04:39] <DaveMethvin> password: Hitler
[08:04:47] <Krinkle> its my little repo for good ol' mediawiki config
[08:04:59] <DaveMethvin> good ol, yeah
[08:05:00] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: that's the eventual plan
[08:05:10] <ajpiano> but the stopgap is to just get the page like, functioning again
[08:05:24] <DaveMethvin> or just saying "i'm not here, intentionally"
[08:05:35] <Krinkle> 've been overwriting the same commit since yesterday. just tweaking some random stuff. Could do it in a branch instead I suppose and merge later.
[08:05:38] <timmywil> gibson042: ping
[08:06:06] <DaveMethvin> so timmywil gibson042 are those sizzle changes almost ready?
[08:06:12] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: gotta say, the number of dupes has been surprising to me
[08:06:18] <ajpiano> are that many people still using it as a resource
[08:06:20] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: landing in a min
[08:06:25] <DaveMethvin> great!
[08:06:38] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: i'm sure they have years of google juice
[08:14:48] <scott_gonzalez> You know what I noticed yesterday? We link to that turotials page three times on the home page.
[08:15:25] <scott_gonzalez> The lightweight footprint, css compliant, cross-browser links all point to tutorials.
[08:15:35] <scott_gonzalez> We just prevent them from going anywhere with JS.
[08:15:55] <scott_gonzalez> Uh-oh, we're lying on the homepage. We're clearly not cross-browser :-P
[08:16:31] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: well, there's also the other 3 times on the home page where we link to it
[08:16:36] <ajpiano> and don't block it with js
[08:16:37] <ajpiano> :p
[08:16:50] <scott_gonzalez> oy
[08:16:54] <scott_gonzalez> We should remove those links.
[08:19:30] <ajpiano> confirm
[08:20:08] <ajpiano> on it here real quick
[08:25:32] <Krinkle> holy crap
[08:25:37] <Krinkle> the wiki is down?
[08:25:49] <Krinkle> how come? I'm in staging
[08:25:56] <Krinkle> stage is fine stage.docs.jquery.com/Tutorials
[08:26:08] <Krinkle> alright, thats it. Lets promote the stage
[08:27:07] <Krinkle> gnarf: can you help rename mysql db jqdocs_jqdocs to jqdocs_old and copy jqdocs_stage to a new jqdocs_live ?

[09:16:50] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: DaveMethvin gonna merge https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/pull/65 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/pull/5
[09:16:51] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on web-base-template by ajpiano (19.126s ago): Remove links to Tutorials page in header and footer of jQuery.com
[09:17:15] <ajpiano> changed the non-functioning links to point to api.jquery.com instead of docs.jquery.com/tutorials
[09:17:27] <ajpiano> it's a stopgap but should help a bit
[09:17:42] <scott_gonzalez> looks good
[09:19:52] <ajpiano> is there a hook that autoupdates the site yet
[09:20:47] <scott_gonzalez> It auto deploys on tags.
[09:21:06] <ajpiano> git tag our-tuts-page-is-mad-old-yo
[09:21:17] <scott_gonzalez> git tag x.y.z
[09:21:24] <scott_gonzalez> Has to be semver.
[09:21:41] <ajpiano> for web-base-template and the content repos?
[09:21:45] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:22:10] <ajpiano> shall i just go ahead and do that, or should we update it manually
[09:22:30] <scott_gonzalez> We should definitely not be updating production servers manually at this point.
[09:22:55] <scott_gonzalez> But you should hold off on tagging web-base-template.
[09:23:06] <ajpiano> yeah, i didn't necessarily think either path was wise
[09:23:07] <scott_gonzalez> Because API sites are in a half-updated state.
[09:23:10] <ajpiano> exactly
[09:23:35] <ajpiano> i can tag the jquery.com one though
[09:23:51] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah
[09:24:18] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer released grunt-jquery-content 0.5.1 with my updates this morning, so I can get the API sites updated after the dev leads meeting.
[09:24:24] <scott_gonzalez> And then we can tag web-base-template.
[09:24:46] <ajpiano> hrm, the only existing tag for the jquery.com repo is "1.8.1"
[09:24:56] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, you'll want to create 1.8.2.
[09:25:08] <scott_gonzalez> The site versions won't match code versions.
[09:25:14] <scott_gonzalez> But the major/minor numbers will match.
[09:25:28] <ajpiano> true enough, but would have been good to start from 0.0.1 or something :p
[09:26:40] <ajpiano> donezo
[09:27:10] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Sure, you can blame gnarf for that :-P
[09:27:24] <ajpiano> that was my plan :D

[09:31:30] <timmywil> ok, just the test in traversing. I'm going to leave that for richard
[09:32:33] <timmywil> I know it needs to "condense", but I still need to understand the full codepath so he can probably do a fix quickly.

[10:03:27] <doesallmagic> * timmywillisn: Sizzle: fixes failing test in css
[10:24:45] <Krinkle> timmywil: just curious, would this be the kind of change that's better done in a branch so that it doesn't merge in master until tests pass?
[10:25:04] <Krinkle> seems a bit nasty, we now have a fowl master, and other changes will be based on that now
[10:25:47] <Krinkle> means that until it is fixed jenkins is running for kicks, regressions aren't reported
[10:30:48] <timmywil> Krinkle: pushing to a branch wouldn't really help. the only failing tests right now are 3 in traversing. they will be fixed later today
[10:31:38] <Krinkle> I know, but its more a principle rather than an actual thing right now
[10:32:51] <timmywil> Ideally, we'd only push successes, but that won't always happen.
[10:33:43] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #383: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/383/
[10:34:31] <timmywil> as for jenkins, it's still hanging on a clean commit that was done yesterday. failing tests aren't the only issue
[10:36:28] <timmywil> granted, I usually run the full suite in at least one browser before pushing so that was my bad. however I don't think it's that big of a deal. "master" doesn't mean "released".
[10:37:30] <timmywil> Krinkle: ^^
[10:59:33] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Is production using web-base-template master?
[10:59:37] <scott_gonzalez> That's really scary.
[11:00:44] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, it's not. Good.
[11:01:16] <scott_gonzalez> Though we've never tagged, so I'm not sure if this is set up yet.
[11:01:40] <scott_gonzalez> We're gonna find out right now though :-P
[11:02:17] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't look like it.
[11:03:28] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...it's running on a commit from 9 days ago.
[11:16:35] <gibson042> timmywil damn those jQuery tests! I think I can address the traversing one pretty quickly, but can you summarize what happened with passing xml to attr?
[11:16:36] <bot-t> (2 hours 7 mins 30 secs ago) <timmywil> tell gibson042 failing test in traversing. `elems.not(":first")` starts with a leading `undefined` in the array
[11:17:40] <gnarf> Krinkle: yo - here now, whats up?
[11:18:04] <Krinkle> gnarf: jqdocs_jqdocs > jqdocs_old (move), jqdocs_stage > jqdocs_live (copy)
[11:18:07] <Krinkle> can you do that?
[11:18:22] <Krinkle> I did create an empty database, couldn't get the rest to work
[11:18:42] <Krinkle> (without the () words of course)
[11:19:07] <gnarf> its safe to do that right now?
[11:20:12] <Krinkle> Yes
[11:20:16] <gnarf> doing so
[11:20:28] <Krinkle> As soon as jqdocs_live is populated, I'll flip the switch and make the new thing live
[11:20:41] <Krinkle> the databases are incompatible so there will be a short downtime while I switch
[11:20:54] <Krinkle> if you do the copy first, we can avoid more down time.
[11:21:13] <gnarf> awesome
[11:21:38] <gnarf> also, can you make me an admin account on this new one when we get it rollin? :)
[11:23:07] <Krinkle> db is migrated, should be able to login on the wiki still
[11:23:27] <Krinkle> I converted the user table as well
[11:28:27] <gnarf> Krinkle: moved
[11:29:11] <gnarf> Krinkle: i don't even have a user on the old docs
[11:29:14] <gnarf> this is why i asked :)
[11:29:24] <Krinkle> ok
[11:34:03] <Krinkle> gnarf: btw, what method are you using for moving a mysql db? and for duplicating/copying ?
[11:34:15] <gnarf> Krinkle: mysqldump | mysql
[11:34:19] <Krinkle> for both ?
[11:34:22] <gnarf> yes
[11:34:42] <Krinkle> I tried using 'create db, then rename olddb.table to newdb.table
[11:34:54] <Krinkle> appeared to work locally, not sure why not on eol3
[11:35:13] <Krinkle> for move that is, for duplicating it would need a dump instead
[11:35:22] <Krinkle> you're copying stage to the new live db now?
[11:41:06] <gnarf> Krinkle: i'm pretty sure I already finished that copy
[11:41:13] <gnarf> Krinkle: old tables might still linger
[11:41:19] <gnarf> but any new tables should be there
[11:41:38] <Krinkle> ok
[11:41:38] <gnarf> Krinkle: if you want, i can drop the whole DB and then copy it from stage instead
[11:42:17] <Krinkle> isn't that what you did?
[11:42:19] <Krinkle> what did you do
[11:44:16] <timmywil> gibson042: Sizzle.attr is overridden by jQuery.attr. The signature for jQuery.attr is ( elem, name, value )
[11:44:41] <gibson042> ah, damn
[11:44:42] <timmywil> passing xml made it a setter
[11:44:50] <gibson042> it was actually a big speedup, too
[11:45:10] <timmywil> yea, been there :)
[11:45:53] <gnarf> Krinkle: i just did mysqldump | mysql
[11:46:02] <gnarf> that only drops tables that it copies
[11:46:04] <timmywil> it's ok tho, no one expects attributes to not be the slowest non-qsa selector
[11:46:14] <gnarf> so any old tables are probably still there
[11:48:47] <gnarf> oh
[11:48:47] <gnarf> hrm
[11:48:52] <gnarf> you're using jqdocs_live
[11:48:55] <gnarf> Krinkle:
[11:48:59] <Krinkle> Yes, I am
[11:48:59] <gnarf> i moved it to jqdocs_docs
[11:49:02] <gnarf> i'll fix
[11:49:46] <Krinkle> I wanted to get rid of the confusing "jqdocs_docs" name. Back up the old wiki as-is to jqdocs_old, and put a copy of the new database in jqdocs_stage to jqdocs_live
[11:49:56] <gnarf> sounds good
[11:50:10] <gnarf> I just was on autopilot and moved it over to jqdocs_docs :)
[11:50:11] <Krinkle> so in the end we have the old one in _old and the new one in _live and _stage
[11:50:15] <Krinkle> no
[11:50:18] <Krinkle> no problem :)
[11:50:26] <gnarf> I'll just drop _docs after this copy to _live finishes
[11:50:35] <Krinkle> k
[11:50:53] <Krinkle> Putting _stage in readonly mode now, just in case someone feels like making edit there.
[11:51:06] <Krinkle> (softwarematic that is, no mysql lock)
[11:51:12] <Krinkle> e.g. in mediawiki conf
[11:54:32] <gnarf> Krinkle: think its moved now
[11:55:06] <Krinkle> okay
[11:55:20] <Krinkle> quick test confirms, they're both up and running as intended
[11:55:32] <gnarf> cool
[11:56:14] <gnarf> Krinkle: thanks for handling that
[11:58:54] <Krinkle> gnarf: There is 2 checkouts of the "docs.jquery.com" repo in /home/jqadmin
[11:59:05] <Krinkle> gnarf: both have a www directory, which is symlinked from /var/www
[11:59:26] <Krinkle> the httpd file is also in the repo and both are symlinked from /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
[11:59:34] <Krinkle> (just so you get a rough idea in case you need to know)
[11:59:34] <gnarf> Krinkle: sounds good
[11:59:49] <gnarf> Krinkle: drop some notes in the issue before you close it :)
[12:00:13] <Krinkle> which one is that
[12:00:20] <Krinkle> infra 81 ?
[12:00:59] <Krinkle> gnarf: pm me username + password for the wiki account
[12:01:11] <Krinkle> (you can change after login)
[12:40:48] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: Bets on how long it takes for a response on 12573?
[12:40:58] <Krinkle> the "Downloading jQuery" is very popular on the wiki still
[12:41:02] <Krinkle> 400+ views in the last hour
[12:41:10] <Krinkle> http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery
[12:41:17] <Krinkle> it is also very up to date :)
[12:41:45] <Krinkle> 1.8.1 + link to blog post of release notes
[12:41:56] <Krinkle> + various CDN links (google, microsoft, jq)
[12:44:02] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: scott_gonzalez: looks like you're the wiki guys around here, kudos for keeping it up to date
[12:44:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure that page is part of the release process.
[12:46:48] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez: its been closed for 13 minutes
[12:46:55] <rwaldron> it was open for 18 minutes
[12:46:57] <gnarf> I'm pretty sure the plan is to eventually get that on http://jquery.com/download Krinkle
[12:47:03] <rwaldron> but I'm in TC39, so there was a delay ;)
[12:47:24] <rwaldron> btw... Object.assign( target, source ) <--- in ES6
[12:47:27] <Krinkle> I've never seen /download before
[12:47:30] <Krinkle> do we promote that?
[12:47:30] <rwaldron> you're all welcome.
[12:47:36] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: No, I mean how long before he replies saying that he doesn't want $.extend() to go away, he just wants us to add half a dozen more methods.
[12:47:38] <Krinkle> how long has it been there
[12:48:04] <Krinkle> oh that page does contain release notes
[12:48:09] <Krinkle> (a link to, that is)
[12:48:21] <Krinkle> that was the only thing keeping the wiki alive
[12:48:26] <Krinkle> can we redirect now then?
[12:48:30] <rwaldron> it's the intersection of jQuery.extend, Y.merge, dojo.mixin()
[12:48:58] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez oh gotcha
[12:49:46] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: and if he says, "jQuery says it's tag line is write less, do more, but this is a case where I have to write more." then we all take a shot of jager
[12:50:01] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[12:50:20] <ajpiano> but that'll probably be in the reply to the reply
[12:50:26] <Krinkle> alrighty, it redirects now
[12:51:58] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: is that process documented somewhere?
[12:51:59] <gnarf> Krinkle: is there a way to make that actually 301 ?
[12:52:25] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: Probably a text file on DaveMethvin's computer.
[12:53:47] <gnarf> Krinkle: right now i get this: http://cl.ly/image/0U2c1n3R2f36 --- was kinda expecting this to just push me there automatically
[12:54:05] <Krinkle> gnarf: eh.. ?
[12:54:43] <gnarf> Krinkle: when i go to http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery -- I just want to get 301'ed to http://jquery.com/download - I don't want to have to click on the redirect link in the wiki page
[12:54:56] <Krinkle> it now forwards instead of a link
[12:55:02] <gnarf> thanks
[12:55:03] <gnarf> :)
[12:55:11] <Krinkle> http://docs.jquery.com/Special:Interwiki
[12:55:27] <Krinkle> regarding 301, good point.
[12:55:44] <Krinkle> it uses 302 for redirects within the wiki by design. something about seo and keywords in the url.
[12:55:53] <Krinkle> (page rank being marginal)
[12:56:05] <Krinkle> but for links to other wikis/sites, it should be 301'able
[12:56:09] <Krinkle> let me see what I can do
[13:01:58] <gnarf> i also kinda like the ?rdfrom in the url
[13:04:04] <Krinkle> you do ?
[13:04:30] <Krinkle> I was going thinking of ripping it out if I can while at it, but I'll leave it
[13:04:47] <Krinkle> maybe don't 301 then
[13:05:00] <Krinkle> or the new canonical home would be including that query string
[13:05:04] <gnarf> for now lets just 302 i guess
[13:05:09] <Krinkle> so it wouldn't improve page rank anyway
[13:05:19] <Krinkle> whatever links to the wiki needs to not link to the wiki :P
[13:05:28] <gnarf> at the end of the day, we can have a list of urls that need to 301 anyway right?
[13:05:48] <Krinkle> what do you mean
[13:06:09] <gnarf> end of the day being like months from now, but like we will have a list of urls to 301 to when we finally turn off docs.jquery.com
[13:06:27] <Krinkle> right to redirect directly from apache
[13:06:34] <Krinkle> yeah, they can be fetched from the database
[13:06:57] <gnarf> cool
[13:07:10] <Krinkle> then output it in a format like + "\nRedirect 301 /{page name} /{resolve target > url}" or whatever
[13:07:15] <Krinkle> and feed to .htaccess
[13:10:45] <Krinkle> gnarf: yeah, the rdfrom can be nice. Useful for statistics I suppose
[13:10:55] <Krinkle> what do we have at jquery for statistics?
[13:11:42] <Krinkle> (other than haxor approach of grepping access.log :P )
[13:11:55] <gnarf> analytics
[13:16:59] <Krinkle> google analytics? ah, okay
[13:17:04] <Krinkle> oh right, that reminds me
[13:17:10] <Krinkle> the new skin doesn't have that
[13:17:58] <Krinkle> it was hacked somewhere in core, I did a clean install and do the skin from a plugin now. but it doesn't have ganalytics yet.
[13:18:11] <Krinkle> gnarf: the snippet may be outdated anyway, can you pm me the snippet that it should be?
[13:18:45] <gnarf> Krinkle: can you steal it from jquery.com - thats all i'd be doin ;)
[13:19:13] <Krinkle> it hostname independent?
[13:19:19] <Krinkle> ok
[13:19:34] <Krinkle> I thought Google Analytics has these "channels" for traffic
[13:19:39] <Krinkle> nice :)

[15:06:59] <jqcommit> [docs.jquery.com/master] Setting: More caching - Timo Tijhof
[15:12:21] <Krinkle> gnarf: k, new settings are live. This should make a noticeable change in the statistics
[15:12:26] <Krinkle> check back in an hour or so?
[15:19:45] <gnarf> Krinkle: will do, you can watch yourself
[15:19:54] <Krinkle> "sid token expired"
[15:19:59] <gnarf> remove it?
[15:20:01] <Krinkle> Do I have credentials?
[15:20:02] <gnarf> it should be open
[15:20:05] <Krinkle> oh, really
[15:20:06] <Krinkle> lame
[15:20:15] <gnarf> yeah i hate that zabbix has sid in its links
[15:20:42] <Krinkle> robust security system :P
[15:21:01] <gnarf> :)
[15:21:08] <Krinkle> well, at least its going down noticably
[15:21:11] <Krinkle> y
[15:21:21] <Krinkle> but not sure in perspective of other days
[15:21:23] <gnarf> could be time based too
[15:21:27] <Krinkle> exactly
[15:21:40] <Krinkle> its not enough constant traffic to see just yet
[15:23:13] <Krinkle> gnarf: can I filter out only eol3 ?
[15:23:49] <gnarf> you can just go to "graphs"
[15:23:58] <gnarf> under monitoring
[15:24:17] <gnarf> http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix/charts.php?fullscreen=0&groupid=2&hostid=10060&graphid=432
[15:24:22] <Krinkle> yeah, I know how to get a single graph of eol3, but can I get like all grape of that one host?
[15:24:33] <gnarf> Krinkle: gotta make a screen for it
[15:24:39] <gnarf> or open two windows
[15:24:39] <Krinkle> aha, interesting
[15:24:41] <Krinkle> yeah
[15:24:44] <gnarf> :)
[15:25:09] <gnarf> that spike in incoming is annoying
[15:25:51] <gnarf> totally throws off the graph package because one data point makes all the rest look like babies
[15:26:52] <gnarf> i would fix this problem if i ever wrote this package myself :)
[15:26:52] <Krinkle> I'm looking at each individual eol3.jq graph now with time range 7 days
[15:26:54] <Krinkle> http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix/charts.php?sid=7c853056ff9dc037&fullscreen=0&groupid=2&hostid=10060&graphid=432
[15:27:18] <Krinkle> seems all okay, not even a spike earlier today
[15:27:49] <gnarf> its those giant spikes that are way out of the data points
[15:28:01] <gnarf> need to be able to zoom vertically to see the diff
[15:28:17] <Krinkle> gnarf: yeah, nagios and ganglia have these dotted and transparent lines, one being data points, the other the rolling average.
[16:20:35] <gnarf> i don't expect a ton of chatter there, but #jquery-infrastructure was just founded if anyone wants to join it - Krinkle johnbender clarkbox jzaefferer scott_gonzalez DaveMethvin etc
[16:21:10] <DaveMethvin> imma join gnarf
[16:26:03] <snover> MOAR CHANNELS
[16:28:36] <gnarf> right....
[16:28:39] <gnarf> #10 for me snover
[16:28:48] <gnarf> well - jquery related that is
[16:29:00] <snover> i have reached my limit
[16:42:22] <Krinkle> not another channel
[16:48:54] <Krinkle> gnarf: btw, regarding redirects on docs wiki
[16:49:07] <Krinkle> not sure whether we should redirect permalink-ish pages from old versions to new versions
[16:49:12] <Krinkle> e.g. docs for 1.2 and 1.3
[16:49:29] <Krinkle> maybe keep those as-is for now?
[16:49:47] <Krinkle> maybe useful reference material later
[16:50:18] <gnarf> we don't really archive those things on the new api sites, we just version all our signatures
[16:50:43] <gnarf> asked DaveMethvin if he thought a redirect seemed in order
[16:51:19] <DaveMethvin> yeah and i randomly answered "yes"
[16:51:25] <DaveMethvin> and I'M STICKING WITH THAT
[16:54:32] <gnarf> Krinkle: I'm not sure how useful the 1.3 docs are
[16:54:37] <gnarf> and i think the only reason they get those views
[16:54:45] <gnarf> is people get to that link after the old download page
[16:54:49] <gnarf> cuz the side bar was so out of date
[16:55:12] <Krinkle> no, the sidebar doesn't (and never did) link to 1.3 docs
[16:55:13] <Krinkle> it inek
[16:55:14] <Krinkle> d
[16:55:23] <Krinkle> it linked to pages that redirected to 1.3 docs
[16:55:45] <Krinkle> so if those redirects target jqcore-api then that would be fixed
[16:56:01] <gnarf> sure
[16:56:07] <Krinkle> e.g. /Ajax > /API/1.3/Ajax
[16:56:18] <gnarf> but we are going to kill off the /API/1.3 folder some day anyway
[16:56:30] <gnarf> this whole domain disappears in the new web plan afaik
[16:56:34] <Krinkle> yeah
[16:56:53] <Krinkle> but I mean, we can redirect without.. ah, I see you didn't delete those pages but replaced content with a redirect
[16:56:59] <Krinkle> which means the history is preserved
[16:57:22] <gnarf> if we ever really want to pull it back, we can internet archive / pull from history
[16:57:31] <Krinkle> if someone wants to add a 1.3 branch after we support versioned api sites, we can. (not planning on, but knowing we don't delete that info is nice)
[16:57:59] <gnarf> p.s. DaveMethvin
[16:58:02] <gnarf> 1.3 api docs
[16:58:03] <gnarf> http://docs.jquery.com/Utilities
[16:58:09] <gnarf> note jQuery.browser
[16:58:19] <Krinkle> http://docs.jquery.com/history/API/1.3/Manipulation
[16:58:20] <Krinkle> click date for old version
[16:59:33] <Krinkle> brb
[17:00:14] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: deprecated? they can't do that!
[17:44:55] <kswedberg> gnarl, DaveMethvin: We have various xml and json schemas of a bunch of previous versions.

[17:45:53] <kswedberg> at some point if someone wants to take on the Herculean effort of reformatting them to current schema, we could tag them in the new repo or keep in separate branches
[17:46:12] <kswedberg> oops. I meant gnarf, not gnarl ↑
[17:46:42] <jqcommit> [jquery] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/4lag4Q
[17:46:42] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Update Sizzle: fix a failing test in traversing. Move an attribute selector test to jQuery-only. - Timmy Willison
[17:47:53] <gnarf> kswedberg: scott_gonzalez is working on 1.8 docs for UI
[17:48:05] <gnarf> we should talk it out see how to handle it for core
[17:48:35] <kswedberg> gnarf. ok.
[17:48:50] <scott_gonzalez> As kswedberg mentions, it'd be a massive task to do it for core.
[17:48:56] <scott_gonzalez> I think it'd be really good to do, but it's massive.
[17:49:20] <scott_gonzalez> I don't plan to ever use @removed in api.jqueryui.com.
[17:49:35] <scott_gonzalez> Because we'll just delete it from that version and we'll have versioned docs.
[17:50:04] <scott_gonzalez> Of course, we're not going back and documenting UI 1.7, 1.6, 1.5, 1.0.
[17:50:26] <kswedberg> of course we should pick only the most important core releases. 1.7, 1.6, 1.5.1, 1.4.2, 1.3(.2?)
[17:50:50] <kswedberg> and maybe not even all of those.
[17:53:34] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: all set
[17:54:05] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: did you get /1.8 working on stage yet?
[17:54:43] <gnarf> also kswedberg #jquery-infrastructure (new channel for server / infra stuff if you have issues)
[17:54:46] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I haven't tried yet. nacin|away said he was going to test the script but never got back to me. I'll probably just test it myself tomorrow.
[17:54:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: sounds good
[17:55:12] <gnarf> lemme know if i need to do anything
[17:55:29] <kswedberg> thanks, gnarl!
[17:55:43] <kswedberg> shit. *gnarf
[17:55:49] <kswedberg> stupid autocorrect
[17:56:27] <gnarf> kswedberg: heh
[17:56:53] <gnarf> kswedberg: soon i'll just add "gnarl" to my highlights
[17:56:54] <gnarf> :)
[17:57:02] <kswedberg> good idea.
