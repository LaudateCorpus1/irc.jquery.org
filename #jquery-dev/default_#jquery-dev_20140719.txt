[05:30:28] <m_gol> oh great, now new Androids don't work: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/3304
[05:33:38] <m_gol> ah, they don't work because they're not on the devices list: http://api.browserstack.com/3/browsers
[05:33:54] <m_gol> again, no notification about the change *sigh*
[18:12:09] <Krinkle> m_gol: Having fun with browserstack?
[18:13:17] <Krinkle> personally I can't wait to switch testswarm to karma and browserstack to saucelabs (at least as the default for local dev, we may want to keep using browserstack, either works fine with karma).
[18:13:37] <Krinkle> I see sizzle uses it already, I'm curious how thats working out.
[18:13:49] <Krinkle> I just started using Karma at Wikimedia as well. Still work in progress.
[19:25:22] <Krinkle> ben_alman: Oh  my, I just spend 2 hours trying to figure out why jquery-hashchange was no longer passing in IE7 after I clean a few things up
[19:25:37] <Krinkle> Eventually I went back and opened up your hosted version at http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-hashchange/unit/jquery-1.3.2.html which was passing
[19:25:45] <Krinkle> then I checked out master again, and it was still failing
[19:26:00] <Krinkle> eventually it turned out it was failing because my hostname is krinkle.dev and IE doesn't like that
[19:26:07] <Krinkle> when I changed it to krinkle.com it passed
[19:26:32] <Krinkle> You can imagine how far things have to go and rule things out before one'd try that XD
[19:27:25] <Krinkle> it also ran 10x slower on .dev, for some reason the event weren't happening
[21:00:42] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle leobalter: You around?
[21:10:46] <Krinkle> Yes
