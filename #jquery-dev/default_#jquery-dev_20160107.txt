[10:39:32] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: ping
[10:40:05] <DaveMethvin> hey timmywil looking at the versions now
[10:40:35] <timmywil> I'm thinking of moving the bower registry over to jquery-dist now
[10:40:48] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah we talked about doing that
[10:40:50] <timmywil> I've got all the tags there https://github.com/jquery/jquery-dist
[10:41:03] <timmywil> I think all that's left is to pull the trigger
[10:41:21] <DaveMethvin> that makes sense
[10:41:44] <DaveMethvin> should we publish the npm packages from there as well?
[10:41:52] <timmywil> yes
[10:41:59] <timmywil> but it should be automated in the release script
[10:42:07] <DaveMethvin> so no more detached head in the main repo, right?
[10:42:11] <timmywil> if it were to fail, you'd do it from jquery-dist
[10:42:16] <timmywil> right
[10:42:18] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[10:42:40] <timmywil> 1.12/2.2 have the release script changes already
[10:42:48] <timmywil> rather, we didn't revert them
[10:43:26] <timmywil> 1.12 will need to remove all the compat references, but should be easy
[10:43:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah the recent 1.12 commit history in particular looks pretty brutal at this point :)
[10:43:54] <DaveMethvin> but if it's passing unit tests at least we have that going for us
[10:44:01] <DaveMethvin> assuming we didn't break those :)
[10:44:02] <timmywil> wanted someone aware while I try this. Worst case, no one can install from bower for a few
[10:44:16] <DaveMethvin> yeah we'll hear about it if there's a problem!
[10:44:21] <DaveMethvin> but that's fine
[10:44:40] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: yea, unit tests look good for 1.12
[10:44:50] <timmywil> okay, gonna try it now
[10:46:33] <timmywil> done
[10:46:54] * DaveMethvin watches twitter for bug reports :)
[10:46:54] <timmywil> I think it worked
[10:47:47] <timmywil> bower install looks good
[10:48:01] <timmywil> old versions still there. That was easier than expected.
[10:48:08] * timmywil waits for an explosion.
[10:48:13] <DaveMethvin> nice, so glad we don't have to bloat the dev repo with those anymore!
[10:49:44] <timmywil> thanks for looking at 1.12/2.2
[10:50:04] <DaveMethvin> still looking through it but so far seems like everything got sorted
[10:50:20] <timmywil> hooray!
[10:51:41] <DaveMethvin> the weekly job has some stuff but i haven't looked into why http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jqueryweekly 
[10:52:06] <DaveMethvin> it's just the support tests
[10:52:11] <timmywil> yea, looks like some of the support test result expectations are off
[10:52:14] <timmywil> fixing now
[10:52:20] <DaveMethvin> not sure why
[10:52:29] <timmywil> my fault
[10:53:06] <timmywil> It was easier to copy/paste the intended list without worrying about values
[10:53:21] <DaveMethvin> ah ok then that's easy to fix!
[10:53:24] <timmywil> went through most of the browsers, but not android

[10:57:28] <jqcommit> 13jquery/061.12-stable 14d224acb 15Timmy Willison: Tests: fix support values for android
[10:58:39] <timmywil> as far as unit tests go, I'd say it looks releasable. Just want to be sure we didn't sneak in some unintended behavior changes.
[11:00:00] <DaveMethvin> given the way people load jQuery i think a beta would be futile
[11:00:12] <DaveMethvin> we just need to release the .0 and fix whatever falls out in .1
[11:00:19] <timmywil> agreed
[11:00:24] <timmywil> was thinking the same for 3.0
[11:00:28] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[11:00:29] <timmywil> alpha to stable
[11:01:04] <DaveMethvin> we really didn't get much feedback about the alpha other than the show/hide stuff
[11:01:14] <DaveMethvin> ok gotta run for a while
[11:01:38] <timmywil> thanks
[11:08:16] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: when you get a chance, could you turn off issues/PRs for jquery-dist?
[11:08:28] <timmywil> `tell DaveMethvin when you get a chance, could you turn off issues/PRs for jquery-dist?
[11:29:51] <m_gol> timmywil: how's the release going?
[11:30:26] <timmywil> m_gol: going to let dave finish his cursory check. I'm finishing up the last item for docs, then I think we're ready.
[11:31:06] <m_gol> timmywil: ok, I was thinking about running jQuery from 1.12-stable on 1.11.3 unit tests & jQuery from 2.2-stable on 2.1.4 unit tests
[11:31:11] <m_gol> locally
[11:31:57] <timmywil> good idea. There may be some acceptable failures, but I'd expect the majority to pass.
[11:32:31] <m_gol> yup, on it
[11:32:51] <m_gol> I'll check Chrome, Firefox and IE11
[11:44:11] <jqcommit> [13qunit] 15mixed opened pull request #916: Core: Enhance check Regexp (06master...06enhanceCompareRegexpOption) 02http://git.io/vu6XF
[11:47:19] <m_gol> timmywil: 1.12-stable has a wrong version
[11:47:26] <m_gol> it reports as 3.0.0-pre+compat
[11:47:37] <m_gol> 2.2-stable has a correct one
[11:47:40] <timmywil> yea, I'll take care of that when releasing
[11:47:55] <m_gol> k
[11:48:02] <m_gol> just making sure that's handled :)
[11:48:26] <timmywil> It's got all the release script changes, which I want to use, but I'll need to remove all the compat-specific stuff
[11:51:47] <m_gol> 5915 assertions of 6042 passed, 127 failed
[11:52:01] <timmywil> 1.12 or 2.2
[11:52:02] <m_gol> 1.12.0-pre on 1.11.3 tests
[11:53:30] <m_gol> for 2.x it's: "6034 assertions of 6140 passed, 106 failed."
[11:53:46] <m_gol> I'll need to look at those errors, tests might depend on non-public stuff
[11:55:17] <timmywil> interesting. I'm in Chrome and get 2 acceptable failures
[11:55:28] <timmywil> for 1.12
[11:55:58] <timmywil> the document.styleSheets tests, which we made more flexible and an offset test that's off by .01, which we also made more flexible
[11:56:41] <m_gol> timmywil: I think some of those failures are legitimate...
[11:56:47] <m_gol> e.g. empty .toggleClass()
[11:56:48] <m_gol> not working
[11:56:59] <m_gol> we dropped that for 3.0 but this one is supposed to be non-breaking
[11:57:12] <m_gol> (unless that's one of these gray areas where sth worked but wasn't documented)
[11:58:00] <m_gol> another failure: "Syntax error, unrecognized expression: p a[href^=#]" - isn't that a breaking change in Sizzle?
[11:58:46] <m_gol> 80% of other failures are effects tests
[11:59:02] <timmywil> oops, I was doing it wrong.
[11:59:23] <timmywil> I see the toggleclass failures now, but they look like assertions about data
[12:00:14] <timmywil> .andSelf is not a function. Did we mean to remove that?
[12:00:21] <m_gol> data as well but not only
[12:00:23] <m_gol> e.g.
[12:00:24] <m_gol> 	ok( e.is(".testD.testE"), "Assert class present" );
[12:00:24] <m_gol> 	e.toggleClass();
[12:00:24] <m_gol> 	ok( !e.is(".testD.testE"), "Assert class not present" );
[12:00:26] <m_gol> this is failing
[12:00:32] <m_gol> the second one, that is
[12:00:42] <m_gol> .andSelf should be removed in 3.0, deprecated before that
[12:00:52] <timmywil> ok, we'll need to add back andSelf
[12:01:58] <m_gol> what about that selector bug?
[12:02:19] <timmywil> I think that's ok. It was invalid before.
[12:02:23] <m_gol> k
[12:02:52] <m_gol> most effects tests are failing with a message: "jQuery.easing[this.easing] is not a function"
[12:04:18] <timmywil> interesting that "hide hidden elements" passes by itself
[12:04:39] <m_gol> true
[12:04:49] <m_gol> maybe on of the tests breaks the environment
[12:04:56] <timmywil> oh, "No timers are still running"
[12:05:06] <timmywil> that might be using somehting internal we changed
[12:06:01] <timmywil> oh, it's still running because of an earlier failure. nvm
[12:06:17] <m_gol> the first failure run by itself fails as well
[12:06:21] <m_gol> sorry, doesn't fail
[12:06:33] <timmywil> weird
[12:06:33] <m_gol> so it's not any individual test but their combination
[12:06:39] <m_gol> remember effects tests use Sinon mocks
[12:06:45] <m_gol> maybe sth's off about that
[12:07:08] <timmywil> yea, not sure
[12:07:24] <timmywil> ok, so we know we need to add back .andSelf. Anything else we're sure of?
[12:08:01] <m_gol> jQuery.acceptData is gone but it was internal so it should be fine
[12:08:16] <timmywil> right, and jQuery.cache too I think?
[12:08:42] <m_gol> no, that was only on 1.x/compat and it's still there
[12:08:55] <m_gol> empty toggleClass should work again, or not? (i.e. the failure I mentioned before)
[12:09:05] <timmywil> oh, those tests are failing because of the effects failures
[12:09:36] <timmywil> the toggleClass one I'm not sure about. If it's not documented for no args, I'd say we shouldn't worry about it.
[12:10:15] <timmywil> I don't see it documented
[12:10:54] <timmywil> at least, it doesn't explain an expected behavior for no args. [ state ] implies it's optional.
[12:12:31] <timmywil> A little strange to do anyway. Seems unsafe to allow toggling all classes.
[12:12:49] <m_gol> As of jQuery 1.4, if no arguments are passed to .toggleClass(), all class names on the element the first time .toggleClass() is called will be toggled. Also as of jQuery 1.4, the class name to be toggled can be determined by passing in a function.
[12:12:55] <m_gol> so it's documented
[12:13:03] <DaveMethvin> hi guys, just catching up
[12:13:12] <m_gol> I remember a discussion about how that signature is messed up
[12:13:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah there were two big changes in class stuff
[12:13:14] <timmywil> you're right, there it is
[12:13:18] <m_gol> but it's there so we shouldn't break it here
[12:13:23] <DaveMethvin> right
[12:13:24] <timmywil> agreed
[12:13:46] <DaveMethvin> did the change to attribute for classes get in? I think it did
[12:13:57] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I've run 1.12.0-pre jQuery on tests from 1.11.3: "5915 assertions of 6042 passed, 127 failed"
[12:13:58] <DaveMethvin> let me find that, i think i was the person who took it out
[12:14:00] <timmywil> it did, we want that tho
[12:14:11] <m_gol> most of these are effects, probably some Sinon misconfiguration
[12:14:35] <m_gol> jQuery().scrollTop() returns undefined, 1.11.3 tests assert it's null
[12:15:47] <timmywil> that one might be acceptable.
[12:15:50] <m_gol> I don't see anything about that in the docs
[12:15:52] <m_gol> k
[12:15:59] <DaveMethvin> here's the commit removing toggleClass(boolean) https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/53f798cf4d783bb813b4d1ba97411bc752b275f3
[12:16:16] <m_gol> ok, everything else in 2.2 failures is in effects, I'll check 1.12
[12:16:33] <timmywil> cool
[12:16:36] <timmywil> m_gol: good idea
[12:16:44] <timmywil> we would have missed these
[12:17:23] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: do we have the .toggleClass(boolean) docs removal in the api 3.0 branch?
[12:17:46] <DaveMethvin> i don't recall we ever had text describing what it did, just the signature
[12:18:09] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: it's there, look for "toggleClass()" on the page
[12:18:12] <DaveMethvin> i was calling it undocumented, but m_gol found text so i guess i was wrong!
[12:18:16] <m_gol> ;)
[12:18:37] <m_gol> documentation police is here! ;-]
[12:18:46] <m_gol> "null or undefined handler" - this is failing in 1.12 only (i.e. elem.on("click", null) throws)
[12:19:04] <timmywil> hmm
[12:19:19] <timmywil> unless we've documented the behavior, I'm okay with that
[12:20:08] <DaveMethvin> i really dislike letting crap through an api silently
[12:20:19] <timmywil> I guess we'll want to add back .toggleClass(boolean) to master too
[12:20:27] <timmywil> needs a deprecation first if it's documented
[12:20:27] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: agreed
[12:20:51] <DaveMethvin> i suspect it would be hard to revert without manual work tho
[12:21:19] <timmywil> oh, gibson042's argument was that it was inaccurately documented
[12:21:25] <m_gol> I don't see .on(sth, null) allowed in the docs, only .on(sth, false)
[12:21:43] <m_gol> but current situation is that it throws on master & 1.12-stable but doesn't throw on 2.2-stable
[12:21:46] <DaveMethvin> i still only see the signature on api.jquery.com and no text
[12:22:02] <DaveMethvin> i guess that is still documented though!
[12:22:06] <timmywil> there's a note about no arguments
[12:22:24] <DaveMethvin> probably better to put it back for 1.12/2.2 in any caes
[12:22:26] <DaveMethvin> case*
[12:22:35] <timmywil> yea

[12:27:25] <timmywil> 2.2 is ok
[12:28:43] <timmywil> now toggleClass
[12:30:11] <m_gol> timmywil: outside of the effects module this "null or undefined handler" is the only difference in failing tests betwenn 2.2 & 1.12
[12:30:23] <timmywil> cool
[12:31:07] <timmywil> I like that, actually. It makes the undefined behavior more consistent for our last mino releases of 1.x/2.x.
[12:33:59] <m_gol> ah, BrowserStack broke iOS 9.0
[12:34:06] <m_gol> I'll update the browser set

[12:44:14] <m_gol> timmywil: I updated the browsers & fixed iOS 9.0 (it's 9.1 now), it'd be good to have at least one more run before the release
[12:44:37] <timmywil> well, we've still got the toggleClass commit
[12:44:42] <timmywil> working on it now
[12:45:04] <timmywil> thank you, tho
[12:52:28] <m_gol> after switching to a full Sinon sandbox in 2.2: 6148 assertions of 6165 passed, 17 failed.
[12:52:50] <timmywil> awesome
[12:55:12] <DaveMethvin> Let me know when you have updated everything in 1.12, Migrate has some recent fails that I'd like to look into: http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jquerymigrate
[12:56:31] <m_gol> after a Sinon fix (although completely different) in 1.12: 6014 assertions of 6045 passed, 31 failed.
[12:57:26] <m_gol> on 2.2: "effects: Animation callbacks (#11797) " - failure at "empty: progress 0"
[12:58:03] <m_gol> that's the only effects failure after the fix
[12:59:23] <m_gol> this is an animation with duration 1 and the progress callback fires with value 1, tests expect 0
[13:03:03] <m_gol> gnarf_: do you maybe know what that can be?
[13:06:06] <m_gol> the rest of the failures seem not important (support tests, some private methods hidden etc.)

[13:07:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah looking it myself m_gol and it seems like it was this change? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2292/files
[13:07:46] <DaveMethvin> ah the comment there explains it i think

[13:08:39] <m_gol> hmm
[13:08:50] <m_gol> so I assume it's not a breaking change?

[13:10:01] <DaveMethvin> you have to pass in no properties to animate and be observing the progress
[13:11:09] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: seems that if you do that you have bigger problems :D
[13:11:30] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[13:15:03] <m_gol> I like that we're no longer installing old jsdom on 1.12/2.2, people were complaining about jQuery compilation errors because of that with 2.1
[13:16:22] <DaveMethvin> i really like that 1.12 is finally gonna be dead and we won't need to cherry pick patches where the internal .data() api always needs to be changed
[13:16:28] <DaveMethvin> :)
[13:18:38] <m_gol> :)
[13:18:58] <m_gol> I'd like to remove all code related to non-supported browsers from master that was kept there only to be more or less in sync with compat
[13:19:09] <m_gol> I mean, from tests, from source they're removed
[13:19:16] <m_gol> (mostly)
[13:20:18] <DaveMethvin> true, i suspect we're checking for a bunch of really crazy edge cases
[13:23:46] <m_gol> so, are we trying to get this non-documented "null or undefined handler" test to behave consistently on 1.12 & 2.2? this is the only difference in passed tests I found
[13:24:30] <m_gol> it was a good idea to run those release candidates on tests from 1.11/2.1, we could've missed a few minor things :-)
[13:25:01] <DaveMethvin> yep, definitely a good idea!
[13:27:04] <m_gol> timmywil: I don't see any more meaningful failures on 1.12 or 2.2, the only remaining question for me is this null handler thing
[13:27:10] <DaveMethvin> m_gol timmywil it looks like this one https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2249
[13:27:17] <DaveMethvin> ?
[13:27:32] <m_gol> looks like it
[13:27:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah we should not land that until 3.0 i think
[13:28:14] <m_gol> yup, this is it!
[13:28:22] <DaveMethvin> should be easy to back out https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/fac67a984268ef8f7de952666fda6d8d32754f5f
[13:28:23] <m_gol> yeah, I'd revert it just for consistency sake
[13:28:33] <m_gol> and we're good after that :-)
[13:28:36] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[13:28:58] <DaveMethvin> i need to figure out what's going on with Migrate, actually i need to start a new run to see if it's still there
[13:52:23] <timmywil> got it. doing the revert now.

[14:04:26] <m_gol> k, running checks again
[14:04:39] <m_gol> wait, why was it on 2.2 as well where it didn't fail the test?
[14:04:40] <DaveMethvin> cool, i'm still waiting for my Migrate job to start so I can see if that got fixed too
[14:05:27] <m_gol> timmywil: your latest 2.2-stable doesn't compile

[14:05:47] <m_gol> not ok

[14:07:08] <m_gol> it didn't fail on 1.12 because we have different JSHint settings there... oh well :D

[14:39:23] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: any idea why manually starting the jquerymigrate job in jenkins isn't working?
[14:39:35] <DaveMethvin> there seem to be two idle jobs
[14:39:45] <m_gol> looking
[14:39:59] <m_gol> jQuery Migrate Core?
[14:40:00] <DaveMethvin> altho i think the 3 that are "running" are stuck, maybe I shoudl clear them
[14:40:02] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[14:40:30] <m_gol> the stage ones have been going for >1month
[14:40:38] <m_gol> they seem to be always on
[14:40:49] <m_gol> but other jobs are firing so it doesn't seem to be the main problem
[14:40:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah i just killed them
[14:41:08] <DaveMethvin> i am pretty sure I've started jobs manually w no problem before
[14:41:28] <m_gol> jQuery Migrate Core is running now
[14:41:33] <DaveMethvin> o there it goes
[14:41:42] <DaveMethvin> i had to go to the job page and start it from there i guess
[14:41:48] <DaveMethvin> i had tried doing it from the status page
[14:42:37] <m_gol> I think it has a wrong browserSet set up
[14:43:23] <m_gol> Warning: Cannot call method 'forEach' for undefined
[14:43:57] <DaveMethvin> ut oh
[14:46:57] <DaveMethvin> seems like it must have been this commit but i don't see a problem with it http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Migrate%20Core/184/
[14:48:16] <DaveMethvin> if there's a problem maybe it's in node-testswarm-config?
[14:54:08] <m_gol> hmm
[14:56:00] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: fixed, build running
[14:56:02] <m_gol> sorry, my fault
[14:56:21] <DaveMethvin> hey you can tell how important it was to me, took a month to discover :)
[14:56:31] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
[14:56:36] <m_gol> I changed jquery to jquery-2 in the config but it associates the key in Gruntfile of this name with the browserSet passed to the testswarm task
[14:56:49] <m_gol> but I didn't change the parameter in the Jenkins job ;)
[14:56:56] <DaveMethvin> i figured it was something like that
[14:57:03] <DaveMethvin> i just didn't know where to look!
[14:57:23] <m_gol> when you start working on Migrate 3, we'll need to reverse both key names
[14:57:57] <DaveMethvin> yeah i need to get going on that
[14:58:09] <DaveMethvin> fortunately i think it will involve a lot of deleting stuff
[14:58:20] <DaveMethvin> my specialty
[15:00:00] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: will you still patch Migrate 2.x?
[15:00:13] <m_gol> because if the answer's yes we need to create a separate Jenkins job for that
[15:00:29] <m_gol> I mean will you still patch 2.x after releasing 3.0
[15:00:32] <DaveMethvin> as long as we keep patching 1.x/2.x i think we would
[15:21:51] <markelog> m_gol: did you land that patch for `px`?
[15:27:05] <markelog> timmywil: you there?
[15:27:20] <timmywil> yup
[15:27:27] <timmywil> sup
[15:42:16] <m_gol> markelog: I didn't
[15:43:11] <m_gol> timmywil markelog: we need to get through the list https://github.com/jquery/jquery/milestones/1.12/2.2 before releasing
[15:43:28] <m_gol> I'll land 2793 on 3 branches in a moment
[15:43:41] <timmywil> ah, right.
[15:44:09] <timmywil> anyone want to take #1785? I can take #2787.
[15:47:38] <m_gol> I'm landing 2793 now, I can take 1785 afterwards
[15:47:48] <m_gol> that is, blacklisting Android 2.3, not actually fixing the issue ;)

[15:52:03] <markelog> m_gol: we also need to properly label 1.12/2.2 issues
[15:52:13] <m_gol> markelog: what do you mean?
[15:52:18] <m_gol> ah
[15:52:26] <markelog> :)
[15:52:26] <m_gol> re-label 3.0.0-labeled issues
[15:52:32] <markelog> i can take care of that
[15:53:05] <markelog> but i would also like if anyone would once again verify 1.12/2.2, since timmy is now compromised :-)
[15:53:30] <markelog> DaveMethvin, gibson042, m_gol: any volunteers?
[15:53:42] <markelog> just a quick look would suffice 
[15:54:17] <DaveMethvin> oh you mean that a lot of 3.0 issues need to be re-targeted for 1.12/2.2?
[15:54:39] <markelog> yeah that too
[15:55:00] <markelog> but also our collection of reverts would be cool to check, just in case

[16:08:01] <m_gol> anyone volunteering to fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2779?
[16:09:47] <timmywil> We've had 3 pairs of eyes on 1.12/2.2 in terms of overal verification. I think we're set once we get the remaining scheduled issues closed.
[16:23:43] <timmywil> what's the course of action for https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2779? I'm wondering if I can just do the same thing I did for 3.0.
[16:24:26] <DaveMethvin> i think the issue there was that 1.x and 2.x did different things right?
[16:24:49] <DaveMethvin> what did we do for 3.0?
[16:24:52] <timmywil> technically a behavior change, but given it was inconsistent, I could make an argument the behavior difference is due to a bug fix.
[16:25:08] <DaveMethvin> yeah no matter what some version will get broken
[16:25:34] <DaveMethvin> i think you applied camelCase to it for 3.0? (basically)
[16:26:06] <timmywil> https://github.com/timmywil/jquery/commit/0e790985a76fd813a6e56696c87abeed5a6cf63b
[16:30:44] <timmywil> I'm not sure there's actually a documented behavior difference
[16:31:35] <timmywil> oh there is
[16:31:40] <timmywil> when retrieving the whole data object
[16:31:55] <timmywil> all keys will be camelCased
[16:32:18] <timmywil> but .data("data-test") still works
[16:32:33] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, m_gol: acceptable?
[16:32:40] <timmywil> sure is cleaner
[16:33:17] <DaveMethvin> i definitely think that's what we want for 3.0 ... is it too breaky for a 1.12/2.2?
[16:33:54] <DaveMethvin> we are probably more than 2-to-1 people on 1.x so whatever that does is going to be the less broken behavior if we continued it
[16:34:19] <DaveMethvin> but whatever we do here i think we agreed that 3.0 should go full camelCase
[16:34:29] <DaveMethvin> (I know you NEVER go full camelCase)
[16:34:30] <timmywil> absolutely, love it for 3.0
[16:34:46] <timmywil> but I wonder if this is too much breakage
[16:35:09] <DaveMethvin> continuing the 1.x behavior for 2.x is best for compat
[16:35:38] <timmywil> wow, it's been like this since 2.0.0
[16:36:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's just an edge case someone would probably only fall across if they were upgrading from 1.x
[16:36:04] <timmywil> alright, I'll just play it safe
[16:36:18] <DaveMethvin> if they started with 2.x they'd probably think *that* was the normal behavior i guess
[16:38:02] <m_gol> we had a spreadsheet summarising the differences
[16:38:33] <m_gol> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gf0vzYGwg7IA7yIkyJs-Jk31SWDogQrBkzPb-xl6u-o/edit
[16:38:45] <DaveMethvin> whew! i've only finished 2 out of 7 pages of issues tagged 3.0 so far
[16:39:16] <m_gol> camelCasing everything will be too breaking IMO
[16:39:21] <m_gol> for 2.2/1.12
[16:41:37] <m_gol> e.g. `elem.data({'a-b': 2}).data()['a-b']` returns 2 in 1.x & 2.x
[16:41:42] <m_gol> but not on master
[16:42:04] <DaveMethvin> i'm okay with that on 3.0/master
[16:42:14] <DaveMethvin> we'll need to document it's all camelCasey
[16:42:48] <m_gol> yeah, on master it's fine, but IMO not on 1.12/2.2
[16:43:00] <DaveMethvin> totally agree
[16:43:26] <m_gol> "Write to both camelCase and regular if different" - this is so sick :D
[16:43:54] <DaveMethvin> You get a prop, YOU get a prop, EVERYBODY GETS A PROP
[16:45:45] <m_gol> Sinon seems to completely break effects tests on Android 2.3...
[16:46:09] <m_gol> not sure how am I supposed to check if it works in that situation...

[16:55:22] <timmywil> hmm, maybe I only did it for 2.2
[16:57:38] <m_gol> timmywil: is it only Android 2.3 or more need to be corrected?
[16:58:28] <timmywil> Looks like I fixed them for 1.12, but I only tested Android 4.x
[16:58:40] <timmywil> Couldn't look at 2.3 in sauce
[16:59:02] <timmywil> so 2.3 probably still needs some updates on both branches
[16:59:19] <timmywil> but those aren't essential for release
[17:01:37] <m_gol> k
[17:02:05] <m_gol> I think I was fixing them on 2.2
[17:02:10] <m_gol> a few weeks ago
[17:02:13] <m_gol> so maybe they're fine
