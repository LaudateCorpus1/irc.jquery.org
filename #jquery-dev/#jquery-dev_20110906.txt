[05:53:38] <bot-t> [#10205] code.jquery.com has an invalid secure certificate (new bug) - http://jqbug.com/10205
[05:54:21] <addyosmani> they can't use any of the other CDNs?.. o.O
[05:54:24] <addyosmani> picky picky.
[05:56:33] <addyosmani> anyway. Just flagging in case ops are around. :)
[06:00:43] <jzaefferer> should be closed as wontfix
[06:00:51] <jzaefferer> they shouldn't use it for production anyway
[06:01:16] <jzaefferer> until we provide proper caching http headers (Expires, Cache-Control)
[06:01:33] <jzaefferer> and they shouldn't use 1.2.6 :(
[06:02:00] <jzaefferer> and really, if you need a secure site, shouldn't you host jQuery yourself instead?

[12:07:11] <paul_irish> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.3/jquery.js is all set now btw

[12:07:32] <paul_irish> love the new minified header.
[12:07:35] <paul_irish> BYTES
[12:08:18] <timmywil> paul_irish: rawk, thx!
[12:21:50] <rwaldron> paul_irish :)
[12:22:03] <rwaldron> minified header is a win
[12:23:19] <rwaldron> timmywil btw we need to address the xhtml/xml content type regression
[12:23:23] <rwaldron> i wish dave was here :\
[16:08:47] <tbranyen> hmmm i'd like to funnel my ajax transport response through jquery to get the status code validation etc
[16:08:56] <tbranyen> right now i have to manually trigger the right callback
[16:09:00] <tbranyen> but it'd be nice to leverage what jquery already has
[16:09:13] <tbranyen> instead of duplicating the conditional that determines if its valid or not
[16:15:38] <tbranyen> seems like that code is actually handled by jquery
[16:15:41] <tbranyen> and not the transport
[16:15:42] <tbranyen> interesting
[16:49:35] <tbranyen> woot figured it out, my b
[16:56:01] <jaubourg> plop
[16:57:35] <tbranyen> jaubourg: yo dog
[16:57:40] <tbranyen> mad loving transport
[16:57:45] <tbranyen> i had a stupid bug earlier, but zomg
[17:31:31] <jaubourg> tbranyen: a bug?
[19:22:46] <tbranyen> jaubourg: yea in my code :)
[19:29:06] <jaubourg> oh :P
