[15:32:20] <addyosmani> Hey DaveMethvin
[15:34:07] <addyosmani> If you're around, there are docs related to an issue with Firefox decoding JSON CORS responses using jQuery that I have ready to add with a workaround from #10338.
[15:34:43] <addyosmani> Trying to decide whether this would fit best on /ajax or on the /getJSON page, if not both.
[15:35:11] <addyosmani> if you get a chance to review/let me know, that would rock :)
