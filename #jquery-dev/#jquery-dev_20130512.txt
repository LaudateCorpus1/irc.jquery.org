[07:55:15] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: $1 is replaced in the url.
[07:55:34] <Krinkle> It can't start with ? however afaik.
[07:55:44] <Krinkle> You can use "Show preview" to test it without saving an edit in the revision history
[07:56:05] <Krinkle> You need a page name and then tack /?whatever onto it
[07:56:19] <Krinkle> makes the url more stable that way, too.
[08:55:26] <Kogster> hey folks, I'm wondering how is it that when I do console.log($('.foo')) I only see an array and not an object. when I try to copy the jQuery structure for my own function, I always see all the functions that I but in the prototype
[08:55:39] <Kogster> s/but/put
[09:14:40] <gnarf> Kogster: support in #jquery
[09:19:16] <Kogster> I thought it'd be more jquery dev related, got my answer anyway
[09:19:22] <Kogster> apparently, if you give length, splice and push to an object it javascript, it acts like an array

[20:35:09] <DRWhite> I am doing an ajax call to get data, but the styling for the "switches" as per the scroll version is not working on radio buttons. how can I force an UPDATE of the jquery on it?
