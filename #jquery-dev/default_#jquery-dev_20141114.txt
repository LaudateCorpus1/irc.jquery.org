[09:28:43] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: you there?>
[09:29:00] <mikesherov> looking into http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10590 and also working on effects as we speak
[09:29:23] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: hey
[09:29:28] <mikesherov> anyway, there were effects that were supposed to effect layout: blind and fold
[09:30:00] <mikesherov> fold makes sense, because you can't configure it so that it's revealing from the bottom up
[09:30:36] <mikesherov> however, blinding up OR is super weird if it effects layout during the animation
[09:30:39] <mikesherov> blinding up OR right *
[09:31:43] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: oops, wrong room
