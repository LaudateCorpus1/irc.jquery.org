[05:23:19] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: what's up?
[13:59:27] <jperrault> I'm working on http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9264.  The issue occurs here: http://tinyurl.com/kocramv.  Is there a reason we are "special casing" heightStyle==="auto"?
[14:03:27] <DaveMethvin> jperrault: not sure but it looks like that's trying to ensure the height is the max of any of the accordion content's hieghts
[14:03:41] <DaveMethvin> since the parent will expand to fill when height is auot
[14:03:43] <DaveMethvin> auto
[14:03:55] <jperrault> yeah, that isn't working.
[14:03:56] <DaveMethvin> you might check in #jquery-ui
[14:04:02] <DaveMethvin> *ask
[14:04:09] <jperrault> it works correctly when that stuff is taken out.  which is why I was asking.
[14:04:32] <DaveMethvin> well at least works for that case i suppose :)
[14:05:04] <DaveMethvin> best to ask in #jquery-ui, someone there probably knows why
[14:05:12] <jperrault> I've been looking at it all day, and there are certainly ways (not pretty) to force it to compute the height correctly, but - and that's why I asked - what are the cases the made that snippet necessary.  k, will do.
[14:05:29] <jperrault> have a good weekend
[14:05:39] <DaveMethvin> you too and thanks for your help!
