[08:57:55] <jaubourg> hey Dave :)
[09:01:09] <JohnResig> alright, meeting time
[09:01:53] <erichynds> $.proxy can accept arguments now as of 1.6, right?
[09:02:23] <ajpiano> i do believe so
[09:02:23] <erichynds> arguments to pass to the proxied function that is
[09:02:50] <erichynds> needsdocs on that guy
[09:05:32] <ajpiano> wanna file a ticket :p;
[09:06:03] <erichynds> i'm on it
[09:12:34] <jaubourg> k, gotta fly... I'll be around more starting Thursday, last few weeks were quite busy
[09:12:53] <timmywil> jaubourg: ciao ;)
[09:12:56] <jaubourg> :)
[09:12:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah i've been busy too, missed you guys <3
[09:13:04] <jaubourg> same here
[09:13:15] <jaubourg> anyway, *vanishes*
[09:14:46] <DaveMethvin> so i've been using google codesearch in trying to understand what's being used in the event system
[09:14:58] <DaveMethvin> the amount of wrong jquery code out there is depressing
[09:15:00] <DaveMethvin> http://www.google.com/codesearch#search/&q=%5C$%5C(%5C%22document%5C%22
[09:15:43] <paul_irish_> :((((
[09:15:50] <DaveMethvin> even more depressing that it works :(
[09:16:21] <DaveMethvin> so one day we will break that and people will whine about it
[09:18:33] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin :\
[09:24:30] <rwaldron> timmywil 7818 needs to be documented
[09:24:33] <rwaldron> and then can close
[09:34:54] <ajpiano> JohnResig: DaveMethvin RACE FOR SECOND SECOND STARTING NOW OMG
[09:35:48] <DaveMethvin> should i second something that involves me getting money?
[09:36:28] <ajpiano> i think that would probably prevent anyone on the team from seconding anything ever
[09:36:28] <ajpiano> soo
[09:37:07] <DaveMethvin> ok, seconded
[09:39:30] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: i have to wait a day now right
[09:39:47] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think it's 24 hours
[09:40:04] <ajpiano> yeah
[09:44:55] <DaveMethvin> GAAAHH! http://www.google.com/codesearch#FwrAznY7wic/trunk/final%20project/index.php&l=14
[09:45:15] <DaveMethvin> that reattaches the live handler on both mouseenter and mouseleave
[09:45:39] <DaveMethvin> but ... it "works" in that it accomplishes the task, albeit with a massive memory leak and performance drag
[09:45:40] <rwaldron> i cant look at these
[09:46:49] <DaveMethvin> yeah i keep thinking of really nice ways to clean up our internal code and say, "well i'd better see if people are doing something that depends on ... oh shit."
[09:48:31] <kborchers[A]> DaveMethvin: it's amazing what you see. helping someone yesterday in #jquery who needed help with .live() and they had never heard of .bind()!!
[09:49:02] <DaveMethvin> wow.
[09:50:26] <DaveMethvin> for this 1.7 stuff i am trying to not break anything, but it appears many people have pre-broken code in addition to code that makes bad assumptions but gets away with it
[09:53:20] <ajpiano> rwaldron: how so
[09:53:39] <ajpiano> i am kind of curious about the whole thing too obviously
[09:53:52] <ajpiano> seems like it was timmywil's commit originally
[09:53:58] <rwaldron> no
[09:53:59] <rwaldron> its not
[09:54:02] <rwaldron> he committed
[09:54:09] <rwaldron> JohnResig authored
[09:54:11] <ajpiano> oh woops
[09:54:19] <rwaldron> the problem is that it wasnt documented
[09:54:26] <rwaldron> that the bind stuff was reversed
[09:54:39] <ajpiano> yeah, i had no idea until... right now.
[11:17:45] <timmywil> rwaldron: it's ok to have closed tickets that need docs
[11:18:06] <timmywil> just need the keyword
[11:19:08] <rwaldron> i disagree
[11:19:32] <rwaldron> "closed" should mean that nothing is left to do
[11:19:57] <rwaldron> whether that's invalid, wontfix, resolved, patched or documented
[11:20:16] <rwaldron> it also makes it easier for API guys to filter the needsdocs tickets
[11:20:48] <timmywil> rwaldron: the issue itself should be closable when the patch is pushed.  docs come afterwards.  there are already several tickets with needsdocs where the issue itself is closed
[11:21:12] <timmywil> as long as the filter includes closed tickets, needsdocs is easy enough to find
[11:21:18] <rwaldron> i think it should only be closed when all tasks are completed
[11:23:35] <timmywil> ok, it's not a big deal, but it should be consistent, so if you're going to open tickets for needsdocs, I think we need open all of them.
[11:23:50] <timmywil> or just close the two that are open now
[11:27:22] <timmywil> If reopened, the milestone is reset and will need to be set back to what it was before in each ticket so we can keep a record of when the actual issue was fixed.
[11:29:37] <timmywil> also, closing it helps me because when I'm going through all of the open tickets, I just want to see the ones that need development.  I can go to the needsdocs filter if I want to work on docs.
[11:31:54] <JohnResig> rwaldron: you just remove the needsdocs keyword once you've added docs
[11:32:01] <JohnResig> closed means it's fixed/landed
[11:33:21] <rwaldron> JohnResig timmywil fair enough, i can see the value of both your points
