[15:59:11] <scott_gonzalez> We've got an effects test that is failing in IE + Edge with jQuery 3.x, but I'm not sure why.
[15:59:21] <scott_gonzalez> Here's the assertion that's failing: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/effects/core.js#L340-L345
[16:01:03] <scott_gonzalez> I have to admit, I'm not sure why this assertion would pass normally since it seems like the animation shouldn't start until after that assertion runs.
[16:05:25] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm.....maybe related to rAF?
[16:17:56] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: could be... if you set the timeout for duringTest to something like 20ms maybe that would work?
[16:19:42] <scott_gonzalez> I tried that, but that didn't work either.
[16:19:55] <scott_gonzalez> Though I think I see the problem now. About to test a change.
[16:20:58] <DaveMethvin> hmmm minDuration 15
[16:21:14] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I tried bumping that up.
[16:22:17] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, mikesherov showed up and we're discussing in #jqueryui-dev now.
