[04:31:00] <sizcommit> [13sizzle] 15timmywil closed pull request #282: Core: Update Properties check for undefined (06master...06style-guide-properties-check-for-undefined) 02http://git.io/IPVePQ
[05:28:20] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: You were too quick for me to review the style guide updates, but they all looked good.
[05:28:23] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[07:46:36] <JamesMGreene> leobalter: Why does the HTML Reporter's `init` method set `config.semaphore` to `1` instead of `0`?
[07:47:58] <leobalter> I don't know, will check to see if I can answer you properly.
[07:48:03] <JamesMGreene> I also am not understanding how `config.semaphore` even gets set right now
[07:48:25] <JamesMGreene> AFAIK, QUnit.start/stop would set it to NaN and it would be stuck there
[07:50:22] <JamesMGreene> o_O
[07:53:30] <leobalter> I just copied that in @113a9d5, when QUnit.init also set config.semaphore: 1
[07:53:34] <leobalter> still searching 
[07:55:59] <leobalter> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/commit/65ade40#diff-d7fa0cdc86a0f504134e3d7c941a3b87R686
[07:56:02] <leobalter> JamesMGreene ^
[08:02:49] <leobalter> JamesMGreene: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/master/src/core.js#L403-L424 QUnit.load previously called QUnit.init, now it sets the semaphore itself and calls the start automatically.
[08:03:46] <leobalter> QUnit.init may probably works without setting the semaphore, but as it is already deprecated, I would leave it as it is regarding it should be removed soon.
[08:15:58] <jqcommit> [13qunit] 15jzaefferer reopened issue #639: Support for valid XHTML is broken because used tags like br and input aren't closed. 02http://git.io/n_VLWw
[09:13:38] <JamesMGreene> leobalter: The difference is that `init` used to be called by `load` in that commit.  It is not any more
[09:13:52] <JamesMGreene> So I think `QUnit.config.semaphore` is probably `NaN` all the time...? o_O
[09:15:08] <JamesMGreene> Hmm
[09:15:22] <JamesMGreene> Somehow gets set to 0 in `v1.15.0`... will have to debug through
[09:17:34] <JamesMGreene> nm, found it
[09:17:48] <JamesMGreene> QUnit.load now sets that value to 1 directly instead of calling `init`
[09:35:06] <JamesMGreene> leobalter: Looks like `QUnit.config.current.assert.test` should be equal to `QUnit.config.current`. Is there a reason we use the former instead of the latter? e.g. backward compat
[09:41:44] <leobalter> QUnit.config.current is a backwards compat reference to the current test. The test object comes with a ref to the assert object, which gets also a ref to the test. http://jsbin.com/xocij/1/edit
[09:43:07] <JamesMGreene> Right, so why wouldn't we just use `QUnit.config.current` instead of `QUnit.config.current.assert.test` when we want a reference to the current test?
[09:43:28] <JamesMGreene> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/74d566f6d5d5fac6e399e0bc158d83dfd6ace4dc/src/test.js#L257
[09:44:38] <JamesMGreene> Perhaps just an accidental holder over from when you were pushing assertions stuff to use `this.test`?
[09:45:24] <leobalter> QUnit.config.current is still there for backwards compatibility
[09:45:35] <JamesMGreene> Yes but won't it always be?
[09:46:11] <leobalter> assert object is seen on the test object
[09:46:14] <leobalter> the problem is:
[09:46:16] <JamesMGreene> My point is if `QUnit.config.current` === `QUnit.config.current.assert.test`, then shouldn't we just use `QUnit.config.current`?  Or will that not always be equal
[09:46:28] <leobalter> It's a recursive ref
[09:46:42] <leobalter> I need the test ref on the assert obj
[09:46:58] <JamesMGreene> ...why?
[09:47:10] <JamesMGreene> Same ref
[09:47:19] <jzaefferer> I think in that instance its unnecessary, but then QUnit.pushFailure will be replaced by assert.pushFailure, so that entire block should go away eventually
[09:47:38] <leobalter> because of this line: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/master/src/assert.js#L32
[09:47:41] <JamesMGreene> Oh, we have an `assert.pushFailure` now?
[09:47:46] <leobalter> I can't rely on the QUnit.config.current
[09:48:38] <JamesMGreene> In that particular case, yes
[09:48:44] <JamesMGreene> I mean, you _could_
[09:48:52] <JamesMGreene> but you don't because it keeps the code more DRY
[09:49:05] <leobalter> and yes, JamesMGreene, the line you pointed is probably wrong, it would be better to use only the QUnit.config.current there
[09:49:16] <JamesMGreene> :+1:
[09:49:56] <leobalter> relying on QUnit.config.current allows async leaks, pushFailure needs to attach himself into any current test
[09:50:42] <JamesMGreene> Understood
[09:51:05] <JamesMGreene> but QUnit.config.current.assert.test allows the same leaks if the reference isn't stored or whatever
[09:52:10] <leobalter> I'll do some tests chaging the QUnit.config.current.assert.test usage to QUnit.config.current, if it works I send a PR
[09:55:46] <leobalter> ok, same errors on test/stack.html. Looks like it's working.
