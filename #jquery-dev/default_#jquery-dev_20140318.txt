[06:12:07] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all! How interested are we in supporting WP7 + Cordova? I have found the following bug: If you run $.ajax( "x-wmapp0:///app/www/external.html" ) on WP7 + Cordova, it errors out because it fails to find a transport. However, if you use plain JS to issue the same Ajax request, it works fine.
[06:13:08] <_|Nix|_> It does not fail to find a transport if the URL is not absolute, that is, if it's something like "www/external.html".
[06:13:31] <_|Nix|_> I'm trying to debug this, but it's really hard, because you can't even use alert, let alone some proper debugging tools.
[06:14:11] <_|Nix|_> Before I dive into how inspectPrefiltersOrTransports() works, I was wondering if it's even worth the trouble.
[06:14:16] <DaveMethvin> _|Nix|_: This is the workaround http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10660
[06:14:21] <DaveMethvin> or at least should still work
[06:14:51] <DaveMethvin> specifically http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10660#comment:5
[06:16:11] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Riiiight. Thanks! Interestingly, this problem does not occur on WP8.
[06:16:28] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: ... even though it uses the same URL scheme.
[06:16:59] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: only as long as we don't decide to nix $.support completely ;)
[06:17:16] <DaveMethvin> by then, Windows Phone 7 will be dead
[06:17:30] <DaveMethvin> let's hope!
[06:17:49] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Yeah, it seems Cordova is also dropping support for it, so the local XHR mechanism that Cordova provides will also be dead.
[06:17:49] <m_gol> :)
[06:18:17] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/apache/cordova-wp8#windows-phone-7-is-deprecated-as-a-target-platform-support-will-be-removed-in-version-370-approx-may-2014
[06:18:35] <DaveMethvin> tick tick tick
[06:18:46] <_|Nix|_> OK. So, not worth the fix. Roger that!
[06:18:54] <DaveMethvin> as many as FOUR users will be impacted! :)
[06:19:38] <_|Nix|_> A travesty of biblical proportions!
[06:20:11] * _|Nix|_ washes his hands
[06:30:06] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: should I add iOS5 to the weekly job? we don't currently test it at all but we should probably drop it at the same time as Safari 5.1
[06:30:43] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: that depends, how badly does it break? :)
[06:31:18] <DaveMethvin> but sure, let's put it on there to see what doesn't work
[06:32:18] <m_gol> I'm afraid we won't be able to remove a lot of Safari 5.1 workarounds as it shares a lot of them with Android 2.3
[06:33:40] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: only 1 error currently in 5.1
[06:33:50] <m_gol> * iOS 5.1
[06:46:25] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: haha, 66 off-by-one errors in offset but only on TestSwarm ;)
[06:46:48] <DaveMethvin> oh boy
[06:47:06] <DaveMethvin> it's a good thing we never expect a clean run from the weekly job
[06:47:10] <m_gol> ;)
[06:47:25] <DaveMethvin> maybe that will all be fixed when we switch to Karma :)
[06:47:26] <m_gol> btw, did IRC notifications go somewhere? I don't think we get notified of failures anymore
[06:47:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah i dunno but i am always looking anyway 
[07:20:28] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: can you update http://meetings.jquery.org/category/core/ or get someone to do it? No updates in two months
[07:21:17] <DaveMethvin> i can do it later today jzaefferer, the google doc is up to date
[07:22:33] <jzaefferer> Would be nice to get those weekly - the closer to the actual meeting, the better
[07:22:58] <jzaefferer> I read the meetings notes in a feed reader
[07:38:59] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Have you used jquery-release on Windows?

[14:43:08] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ping
[14:43:26] <DaveMethvin> sup m_gol 
[14:43:31] <m_gol> what do we do with http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13276?
[14:43:47] <m_gol> this is explicitly about copying nodes between different XML docs
[14:43:55] <m_gol> and it's the only AJAX failure in Android 2.3
[14:45:05] <DaveMethvin> i'm okay with leaving it for the beta m_gol 
[14:45:39] <m_gol> I was looking today into Android 2.3 failures
[14:46:02] <m_gol> and we have to bring back returnValue in isDefaultPrevented, the rest of effects is fine
[14:46:32] <m_gol> and then there's this cross-document XML stuff, we were supposed to back those tests out but now I have doubts considering this specific issue was considered to be a bug in 1.x and was fixed
[14:46:51] <DaveMethvin> for just dealing with old Android i'd be happier to just skip that unit test
[14:47:05] <DaveMethvin> the one for propagating events
[14:47:13] <DaveMethvin> it was quite a while before someone noticed it
[14:47:17] <DaveMethvin> so it can't be common
[14:47:47] <m_gol> did anyone notice it or just our unit tests? ;)
[14:47:57] <DaveMethvin> there was a ticket, let me find it
[14:48:05] <DaveMethvin> the cross-doc XML again i wonder if it's worth all that effort for android 2.3 
[14:48:48] <m_gol> gibson was surprised those tests actually work anywhere ;)
[14:49:15] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7793
[14:49:24] <m_gol> TestSwarm doesn't show it but Android 2.3 passes effects test suite
[14:49:39] <DaveMethvin> wow, unexpected!
[14:49:43] <m_gol> so it's 1 event bug, one ajax bug and 18/19 in manipulation
[14:51:02] <DaveMethvin> i wouldn't mind reintroducing event.defaultPrevented but Chrome complains on the console so we'd have to feature detect or something to avoid making people mad about it
[14:51:08] <m_gol> so you claim this 7793 bug is hardly encountered, therefore not worth fixing it in 2.x just for Android 2.3 case?
[14:51:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think that's true
[14:51:49] <m_gol> you mean getPreventDefault()?
[14:51:53] <m_gol> defaultPrevented is the standard one
[14:52:04] <m_gol> but we already use getPreventDefault in Android 2.3
[14:52:10] <m_gol> it's just it doesn't help :P
[14:52:19] <DaveMethvin> or at least tried to yeah
[14:52:20] <m_gol> but when I brought back returnValue, it started to work
[14:52:36] <DaveMethvin> and that's the one Chrome complains about
[14:52:38] <m_gol> so maybe we could just fallback to returnValue & nix getPreventDefault in 2.x
[14:53:01] <DaveMethvin> oh, yeah, that would work as long as nobody needs getPreventDefault
[14:53:24] <m_gol> there's "Support: Android < 4.0" over this getPreventDefault line
[14:53:51] <m_gol> I hope it's not sometimes using returnValue & sometimes getPreventDefault :P
[14:54:00] <DaveMethvin> that would be sad
[14:54:09] <m_gol> Android 2.3 is sad :P
[14:54:26] <DaveMethvin> confirm
[14:55:31] <m_gol> well, it seems to help
[14:55:41] <m_gol> I fixed a bug by removing 5 bytes ;)
[14:55:50] <DaveMethvin> YAY!
[14:56:09] <DaveMethvin> remove moar bytes
[14:56:20] <DaveMethvin> 0 bytes = no bugs
[14:57:23] <m_gol> ain't this pretty: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1545/files
[14:57:36] <m_gol> we could save even more in 1.x
[14:57:56] <DaveMethvin> something must need the getPreventDefault
[14:58:00] <m_gol> I'll check if it doesn't brake anything else, lol
[14:58:07] <DaveMethvin> but who knows maybe it's Firefox 2
[14:58:13] <m_gol> ;)
