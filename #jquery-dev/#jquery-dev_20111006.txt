[07:27:50] <rwaldron> tha contenteditable ticket is yet another duplicate
[07:27:52] <rwaldron> http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/UqNwL/
[07:27:59] <rwaldron> they need to use "removeProp"
[07:28:08] <timmywil> eek, no
[07:28:11] <rwaldron> no?
[07:28:26] <rwaldron> (also, the error I saw seemed to be unrelated...)
[07:28:57] <timmywil> apparently setting contenteditable to empty string throws an error because it's an "invalid value"
[07:29:00] <rwaldron> hahah NEVERMIND
[07:29:12] <rwaldron> -1 for browserstack being tooooooo sloooowwww
[07:29:36] <rwaldron> disproved self just now :D
[07:29:50] <rwaldron> ack, i'll be back in a bit
[07:29:52] <timmywil> I've got a patch coming
[07:29:54] <rwaldron> have fun with that

[09:48:48] <jzaefferer> hey gnarf, I looked into why Jenkins might be running builds without new commits - looks like a bug in the git plugin: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery/105/pollingLog/?
[09:49:12] <jzaefferer> sometimes I can't "find" the workspace/checkout, so it runs the build anyway..
[09:49:39] <jzaefferer> not sure why that happens
[09:49:58] <jzaefferer> but while there, I added the repo browser setting, so it should now link back to github on the job itself
[09:52:30] <gnarf> hrm

[13:09:21] <clarkbox> http://jsperf.com/each-or-for-over-elements
[13:09:54] <clarkbox> can that last test be sped up? or is there a good reason for the slowness?
[13:21:44] <eddiemonge> clarkbox: ask in #jquery as its more appropriate for there i think
[13:22:42] <clarkbox> well it involves internals of jquery... and im willing to dig and possibly submit patch if there is no good reason
[13:23:33] <clarkbox> im not wondering if i can do something externally to speed that up. im wondering WHY the lib is slow in that case
[13:23:42] <clarkbox> very minor.... just curious
[13:26:07] <eddiemonge> its not really slow. .each calls a function which probably does some checks. the empty for loop is super fast because its not doing anything since the loop is never ran
[13:27:47] <clarkbox> understandable
[13:38:29] <clarkbox> must be a way to short cut that scenario faster... hmmm.
[13:40:21] <clarkbox> see my latest revision eddiemonge
[13:41:03] <clarkbox> http://jsperf.com/each-or-for-over-elements
[13:48:02] <clarkbox> what about: if(!isObj && length < 1){return;}
[13:48:12] <clarkbox> on line 613 in core.js?
[13:48:16] <clarkbox> would that be safe?
[13:48:27] <clarkbox> _untested_
[13:53:08] <gnarf> clarkbox: for will always be faster
[13:53:15] <gnarf> but each gives you a closure
[13:53:21] <clarkbox> i get that
[13:53:34] <clarkbox> but i would think each should be fast_er IF possible
[13:57:57] <ajpiano> enjoy wtf

[15:52:35] <ajpiano> HAHHA i was wondering why the fiddle /6 was so high
[15:52:40] <ajpiano> when it was the first time i saved it
[15:52:52] <rwaldron> hahaha
[15:53:15] <rwaldron> I followed up with an "RTFM" just now
[18:32:58] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: did you want docs#9941?
[18:33:02] <bot-t> rwaldron, #9941 (BB 5.0 - jQuery.removeEvent(elem, type, handle) throws ... - Opened 2 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9941
[18:33:23] <rwaldron> I'm more concerned with
[18:33:23] <jaubourg> always the same getting christmas presents :P
[18:33:26] <jaubourg> hi dave :)
[18:33:26] <rwaldron> docs#10427
[18:33:28] <bot-t> [#10427] Creating custom elements is broken on IE7 and 8 using $('<...>'). (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/10427
[18:33:45] <jaubourg> jaqueries needs support all magic
[18:33:47] <ajpiano> what do you guys think of my idea
[18:33:56] <rwaldron> what is your idea?
[18:34:09] <ajpiano> make the list of shivd elems exposed
[18:34:15] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin sure
[18:34:23] <ajpiano> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10427#comment:9
[18:34:34] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: that should shut em up
[18:34:44] <rwaldron> I
[18:34:46] <rwaldron> ak
[18:34:48] <rwaldron> wow
[18:34:50] <rwaldron> ok...
[18:34:52] <rwaldron> so yeah
[18:34:55] <rwaldron> i
[18:34:57] <DaveMethvin> but the problem woud be that it would have to happen before we shivved
[18:34:57] <rwaldron> ahahahahahaha
[18:35:35] <DaveMethvin> so like if they didn't push on their custom <mytag> until .ready() it would be tooo late
[18:35:39] <rwaldron> well, the fact is that it wont really do any good for creating the elements in the first place
[18:35:54] <DaveMethvin> why can't they just shiv their own elements?
[18:35:55] <rwaldron> all we do now is make sure that innerHTMLing and cloneNodeing works
[18:36:03] <rwaldron> they will have to no matter what
[18:36:06] <DaveMethvin> that big-ass patch is just too ugly to consider
[18:36:10] <rwaldron> but ajpiano, that is a nice idea
[18:36:15] <DaveMethvin> i see what they
[18:36:18] <rwaldron> it just wont pay off the way they want it to
[18:36:22] <DaveMethvin> are doing and it scares me
[18:36:34] <ajpiano> yeah the approach is a sink hole
[18:36:40] <ajpiano> to just possibly try and do it on the fly all the time
[18:36:42] <ajpiano> yeesh
[18:37:08] <jaubourg> what is the use case of supporting custom elements... like what would be the use case of <jaubourg></jaubourg>? Just curious here.
[18:37:11] <rwaldron> my first idea, originally... was to try an just create shit on the fly
[18:37:21] <rwaldron> that idea worked like a hole in the head
[18:37:25] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron i pinned 9941 on you but only b/c you wouldn't let me close it :P
[18:37:44] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin that's cool
[18:37:53] <rwaldron> I'll either find a small fix or close it
[18:37:55] <rwaldron> :D
[18:37:57] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: GOOD QUESTION
[18:38:24] <DaveMethvin> passing an arbitrary xml document to IE8's html tag-soup parser perhaps?
[18:38:35] <DaveMethvin> yuck
[18:38:55] <ajpiano> hmm, i don't know how they'd be able to pass the list of stuff in unless we had an explciit mechanism for running new shivs
[18:39:32] <ajpiano> jQuery.shiv("breakfast lunch dinner")
[18:39:33] <ajpiano> :o
[18:39:52] <rwaldron> shi(v|m)s have to happen in the head
[18:39:54] <DaveMethvin> we need an acronym: Special Html Insert Tag
[18:39:59] <DaveMethvin> jQuery.SHIT()
[18:40:12] <rwaldron> if you have <bullshit></bullshit> declarative markup
[18:40:41] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i think  handling html5 tags is sufficient, and probably will prove insufficient when misused by the masses
[18:40:49] <ajpiano> rwaldron: so we are only shiving exactly what's being done by html5shim?
[18:40:57] <rwaldron> so, we then have a weird "you can ONLY use your <bullshit> elements AFTER the dom has loaded"
[18:41:04] <rwaldron> ajpiano yep
[18:41:14] <ajpiano> rwaldron: but if we had that caveat, it would work?
[18:41:25] <ajpiano> or do the elements have to have been shived in the head initially AND in ever frag
[18:41:29] <ajpiano> or only in the frag matters?
[18:41:37] <DaveMethvin> what caveat, i am ignoring your caveat and expect it to work the way i want it to
[18:42:01] <ajpiano> we'd have to explain a lot more mechanics
[18:42:07] <rwaldron> ajpiano the latter
[18:42:17] <ajpiano> instead of just like "include html5shim and this and your html5s will work right")
[18:42:18] <rwaldron> if you want full use
[18:42:45] <rwaldron> yeah, it's basically in the "not really jquery anymore" zone
[18:43:16] <ajpiano> is it worth exposing a mechanism by which someone *can* give jquery a list of elems
[18:43:20] <ajpiano> assuming they've taken care of the normal shiving
[18:43:24] <ajpiano> in the head?
[18:43:28] <rwaldron> maybe
[18:43:31] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ^
[18:43:32] <rwaldron> ?
[18:43:37] <rwaldron> we _could_ do that
[18:43:49] <rwaldron> an basically say, "you're on your own from here"
[18:43:56] <ajpiano> as in like "i get how html5shim work, i'm doing it for my custom elements, just let jquery do it too please!!"
[18:44:03] <rwaldron> yeah
[18:44:16] <DaveMethvin> how much biggerness?
[18:44:23] <DaveMethvin> docs too
[18:44:26] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin tiny
[18:44:35] <rwaldron> let me see what I can do
[18:44:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah should be
[18:44:37] <ajpiano> it's just exposing safeFragment
[18:44:37] <rwaldron> one sec
[18:44:45] <rwaldron> hahah noooo
[18:44:49] <rwaldron> not the function
[18:44:55] <rwaldron> I'll give them the list it uses
[18:45:00] <rwaldron> even easier
[18:45:08] <ajpiano> yea i'm sure you have a good idea
[18:45:12] <ajpiano> thanks for entertaining the concept
[18:46:16] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: it's not even *that* hard to doc
[18:46:29] <DaveMethvin> not saying it is, just that it has to be
[18:46:36] <rwaldron> i forgot that safeFragment (the function) was actually renamed createSafeFragment
[18:46:58] <DaveMethvin> speaking as someone with quite a bit of doccing to do or kswedberg will not let me be his roomie next conf
[18:48:13] <jaubourg> man, screw this custom element bs
[18:48:31] <ajpiano> we just say that "jQuery now supports the creation of both HTML5 and custom arbitrary tags on the fly in IE, assuming those elements have been properly 'shimmed.'  For HTML5 support, you simply need to include the <a href='html5shim'>html5shim</a> in the <head> of your document.  For any custom element types, you'll need to use the technique employed by html5shim in your head, and use [whatever API we end up exposing]"
[18:48:33] <jaubourg> I've been thinking about it for the last 10 mins and it just doesn't make sense at all
[18:51:10] <ajpiano> i just think it's worth not dismissing entirely, i'm fine with tabling it for 1.8 discuss
[18:51:22] <ajpiano> but like, we should see what everyone thinks, i agree it's kind of weird
[18:51:30] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ajpiano i basically did nothing and it results in +16 bytes
[18:51:53] <DaveMethvin> SIXTEEN BYTES!
[18:52:00] <DaveMethvin> oh well
[18:52:04] <rwaldron> I'm stealing some
[18:52:05] <rwaldron> one sec
[18:53:41] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: let's table it for 1.8-discuss, it may not be a lot of bytes but it's not critical
[18:54:15] <ajpiano> yeah, just throw your impl into the ticket as a reference for future great good
[18:54:23] <rwaldron> cool with me
[18:54:28] <rwaldron> will do
[18:55:19] <ajpiano> guy was pretty reasonable when i talked to him about it this morn, told him we considered it a feature not a bug
[18:55:22] <DaveMethvin> thanks!  just about have the unreviewed ticket queue emptied
[18:55:42] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: reasonable? that WILL NOT DO
[18:56:55] <ajpiano> awesome DaveMethvin
[18:58:13] <rwaldron> https://github.com/rwldrn/jquery/pull/new/10427
[18:58:32] <ajpiano> jQuery.shims()
[18:58:34] <ajpiano> <3
[18:58:48] <ajpiano> but wait
[18:58:54] <ajpiano> when do i set this
[18:59:01] <ajpiano> that's why i said there had to be a method
[18:59:32] <rwaldron> jQuery.shims.push("bullshit")
[18:59:40] <rwaldron> at the beginning
[18:59:50] <rwaldron> * of your app
[19:00:01] <ajpiano> after jquery loads?
[19:00:15] <rwaldron> sure and anytime you do innerhtml or clonenode it will work
[19:00:23] <rwaldron> as long as you've shimmed it yourself
[19:00:30] <rwaldron> along with your other HTML5 elements
[19:01:16] <ajpiano> oh cool i didn't realise the timing of it, derp
[19:01:17] <ajpiano> sweet
[19:01:27] <rwaldron> actually, hrm
[19:01:39] <rwaldron> i think you were right!
[19:02:01] <rwaldron> i re-checked, i was wrong
[19:02:06] <rwaldron> so.. err
[19:02:16] <rwaldron> this is harder and crappier then originally though
[19:02:19] <rwaldron> thought*
[19:02:24] <ajpiano> cause right now you'd have to do something like, jQuery.shims = jQuery.shims.concat("hamburger hotdog".split(" "))
[19:02:43] <rwaldron> sayyyyy what
[19:02:52] <ajpiano> right?
[19:02:59] <rwaldron> push("hamburgers", "hotdogs")
[19:03:03] <rwaldron> push is variadic
[19:03:09] <rwaldron> but still it's no good
[19:03:12] <ajpiano> same diff
[19:03:14] <rwaldron> because you were right
[19:03:30] <ajpiano> cause if you want to shim html5 as well as custom, etc.
[19:03:32] <ajpiano> ah
[19:03:33] <ajpiano> interesting
[19:03:42] <rwaldron> by the time $(document).bind("ready"....) that safeFragment has already been made
[19:03:43] <ajpiano> i also am not wearing pants, i have to shower
[19:03:57] <rwaldron> i'll have to rethink this
[19:04:00] <rwaldron> and it will be more code
[19:04:04] <rwaldron> ...not ideal.
[19:04:51] <ajpiano> yeah the surfacing of it is weird
[19:04:55] <ajpiano> w/e ITS TABLED
