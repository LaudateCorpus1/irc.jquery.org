[08:31:15] <DaveMethvin> Looks like I managed to break iOS 6 with that last batch of patches http://swarm.jquery.org/result/1655535
[08:31:30] <DaveMethvin> seems like it would be this one but I'm not sure HOW https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/3a68c114e3a30af86dc261c9d62ce2ae4144d420
[08:31:44] <DaveMethvin> anyway I'll be looking at it
[08:51:32] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ha! good I added it :)
[09:02:26] <scottgonzalez> DaveMethvin gnarf: Can someone unmute #jquery-meeting?
[12:01:27] <Krinkle> kborchers: I received the membership e-mail three times (UTC: 17:24, 18:22, 18:31 = 1.5 hour ago). All sightly different (the first two look identical, the last one has collapsed all whitespace/line breaks, and has a visible Bcc header to myself)
[12:01:41] <Krinkle> I only signed up once though afaik.
[12:02:14] <kborchers> Krinkle: yeah, that was my bad ... google delayed delivery for something like 3 hours so in that time i tried a couple more times. sorry about that
[12:02:23] <Krinkle> ok
[12:02:48] <kborchers> Krinkle: also have no idea why that last one had all of those differences either. really weird
[12:03:04] <Krinkle> bbl
