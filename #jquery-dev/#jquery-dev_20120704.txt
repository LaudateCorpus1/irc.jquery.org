[02:14:11] <nod_> hey guys, I've catched up with what's happening with jQuery dev, jQuery 2 sounds really exciting
[02:15:16] <nod_> when was that started if it's not too indiscreet?
[02:15:59] <nod_> a couple of month ago dave seemed really sceptic about the idea
[02:39:10] <nod_> as in, against it.

[07:14:19] <ryanneuf_> ?tell gnarf I shared the reading vids w/ you on drop box. A couple have to finish uploading. I'll bring my laptop to work. Should be done in couple hours.
[07:14:20] <bot-t> ryanneuf_, Okay.
[07:22:50] <timmywil> it may not get a lot of attention until tomorrow or later today
[07:47:40] <timmywil> ?tell ajpiano whenever you get a chance, we need a tweet for the blog. no rush.
[07:47:41] <timmywil> well bot

[08:39:56] <jaubourg> timmywil: retweeted
[08:44:32] <gdoron_> ?
[08:46:31] <timmywil> jaubourg: thanks!
[08:47:30] <timmywil> gdoron_: I'm not sure where to point you. scott heads up UI, but it seems he's out at the moment
[08:48:30] <gdoron_> umm.. Do you think it will be hard to adjust the default Gregorian ?
[08:55:49] <timmywil> gdoron_: I'm not sure
[08:59:09] <nod_> hello :) I'd like some info about jQuery 2 can someone help me?
[08:59:41] <gf3> gdoron_: You should try #jquery
[08:59:43] <nod_> I was wondering when you guys decided to go this way and which things helped you take the decision
[09:00:08] <nod_> (I must say I'm really happy about it)
[09:00:19] <gdoron_> no one replied there...
[09:08:50] <nod_> I guess I should be asking DaveMethvin about jQuery2 and what triggered the change of opinion? :)

[10:13:07] <bharath> I am new to jquery development . can anyone suggest some bugs for a newbie to work on?
[10:24:44] <ryanneufeld> bharath: I'd suggest you start with the bug tracker
[10:24:54] <ryanneufeld> find something that you think you can do, and do iyt
[10:24:56] <ryanneufeld> *it
[10:58:15] <Krinkle> timmywil: Do you know anything about the server architecture / os software on jquery server (e.g. jqswarm01?)
[10:58:20] <Krinkle> I'd like to install ack-grep
[10:58:43] <Krinkle> If not, who should I reach out to
[10:59:00] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: what email did you share with? can you use corey@momentumworkshop.com ?
[10:59:00] <bot-t> (3 hours 44 mins ago) <ryanneuf_> tell gnarf I shared the reading vids w/ you on drop box. A couple have to finish uploading. I'll bring my laptop to work. Should be done in couple hours.
[10:59:23] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I used gnarf@gnarf.com
[10:59:31] <gnarf> gnarf@gnarf.net ;)
[10:59:56] <gnarf> but corey@momentumworkshop.com is my drop box acct email either way
[11:00:03] <timmywil> Krinkle:I'm not sure, I usually go to danheberden or gnarf with those questions
[11:00:12] <Krinkle> alrighty
[11:00:17] <Krinkle> danheberden: gnarf: hereby :)
[11:00:21] <gnarf> Krinkle: wtf does ack-grep do?
[11:00:26] <gnarf> and why do we want it?
[11:00:27] <Krinkle> gnarf: ack
[11:01:14] <Krinkle> gnarf: you know what grep is? well, ack is that on steroids. Has been a standard for years imho. I'm trying to find something in /srv/swarm.jquery.org I was surprised it wasn't installed
[11:01:14] <gnarf> are we planning on using it in our toolchain, or like - will swarm depend on it?
[11:01:24] <Krinkle> swarm will not depend it
[11:01:28] <Krinkle> on it*
[11:01:33] <gnarf> Krinkle: i've never heard of it and I've been linux hacking since the late nineties - so... ;)
[11:01:53] <Krinkle> On ubuntu it is package "ack-grep" because "ack" was already taken
[11:02:01] <Krinkle> http://betterthangrep.com/
[11:02:24] <gnarf> it looks like a useful tool, and if you want it to make your life easier on the server, feel free to install it
[11:02:34] <gnarf> as long as it isn't required to run shit, I don't need to worry about it :)
[11:02:47] <Krinkle> gnarf: hence my question, how do/should I do that?
[11:02:51] <Krinkle> It appears there is no apt-get
[11:02:57] <Krinkle> what do you guys use?
[11:02:58] <gnarf> oh - well that machine is old
[11:03:03] <gnarf> the new one has apt-get
[11:03:09] <gnarf> i think that one is... umm...
[11:03:12] <Krinkle> right.
[11:03:15] <gnarf> yum maybe?
[11:03:38] <Krinkle> yum it is
[11:03:40] <Krinkle> thx
[11:03:42] <gnarf> np
[11:04:24] <Krinkle> gnarf: should I document what is installed? (I heard you're about or going to use puppet?)
[11:04:36] <gnarf> new thing is using puppet yes
[11:04:46] <Krinkle> We use puppet at wmf as well, pretty nice :)
[11:04:53] <gnarf> clarkbox & jörn are working on a new swarm
[11:04:58] <Krinkle> right
[11:05:16] <Krinkle> (wmf=Wikimedia Foundation; wasn't sure whether that was obvious in this context)
[11:05:24] <gnarf> but like, a package you want to make your editing/searching files there easier is not a package that needs to be specified in puppet ;)
[11:05:40] <gnarf> i thought it was a window media file... ;)
[11:05:45] <Krinkle> right
[11:06:02] <Krinkle> I hate how package managers ask permission half-way install to store 8 kb
[11:06:04] <Krinkle> ARGH!
[11:06:04] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I sent it to the email you gave me. Removed perms on the other one
[11:06:11] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: thx, got it
[11:06:13] <Krinkle> there's probably a way to surpress that , but still
[11:06:44] <Krinkle> "Oh mighty console commander, are you sure you got 8 kb available? Its a lot of bytes you ,now"
[11:06:45] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: lol - folder full of laughs
[11:07:19] <Krinkle> BRB later, dinner
[11:07:19] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: Yeah, I lol'd at them again. Showed my wife. She like *stare*..."It must be funnier to you"
[11:07:35] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: and now i just need to find some audio tools to try to clean it up a bit
[11:07:48] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: yeah.. I'm not a vidya editor
[11:08:01] <ryanneufeld> and clearly not good at holding still
[11:08:05] <ryanneufeld> but the lulz are there
[11:08:50] <gnarf> nice
[11:11:50] <ryanneufeld> I've also never heard of this ack-grep
[11:16:54] <gnarf> heh, ben_alman is crackin me up with his string of numbers
[11:17:18] <gnarf> this thing did a pretty decent job of capturing video
[11:17:31] <gnarf> only way to make it better woulda been a "tripod" :)
[11:19:32] <ryanneufeld> yeah, like I said, not good at the vidyas
[11:24:16] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano, is killing me with his readings
[11:39:04] <gnarf> BUY OUR PRINTS!!!
