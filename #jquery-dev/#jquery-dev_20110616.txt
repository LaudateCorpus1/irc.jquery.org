[06:21:27] <louisremi> Hey rwaldron, yt?
[06:50:41] <rwaldron> louisremi i am
[06:50:44] <rwaldron> whats crackin'
[06:51:16] <louisremi> rwaldron: I wanted to know if you had 2 minutes to review some code I wrote for an article about EventSource
[06:51:32] <rwaldron> absolutely
[06:51:36] <rwaldron> link?
[06:51:56] <louisremi> great
[06:52:08] <louisremi> the most interesting parts are here: https://gist.github.com/1027192
[06:53:04] <louisremi> the project is hosted on http://oclast.com/sse.php
[06:54:38] * rwaldron looking
[06:58:57] <louisremi> rwaldron: the article is not yet published, but I've got a pdf version of it if you want to have a look at it
[07:00:01] <rwaldron> yeah definitely
[07:00:19] <louisremi> rwaldron: I don't have your email address...
[07:01:31] <rwaldron> oh sorry
[07:01:34] <rwaldron> waldron.rick@gmail.com
[07:04:01] <louisremi> sent
[07:06:45] <rwaldron> heads up, louisremi i'm still here, just playing with the code for few minutes
[07:07:00] <louisremi> alright
[07:08:02] <rwaldron> this is cool
[07:08:14] <rwaldron> i like how you're using the event types
[07:10:42] <louisremi> .
[07:10:50] <rwaldron> oh whoops, i didnt notice you were gone
[07:10:55] <rwaldron> i said...
[07:10:56] <rwaldron> <rwaldron> this is cool
[07:10:56] <rwaldron> <rwaldron> i like how you're using the event types
[07:11:27] <rwaldron> when i first wrote jQuery.EventSource, that feature didnt work :|
[07:11:30] <rwaldron> this is super cool
[07:17:31] <louisremi> rwaldron: thanks! When I wrote about EventSource in the "Aurora 6 is here" article, I used the initial specification with the <source> element. So this time I thought it would be better to let someone review my code before ;)
[07:18:27] <rwaldron> when i first discovered SSE last year, I spent an entire day trying to find the 1 version of Opera that had supported that implementation
[07:18:37] <rwaldron> its was like 8.?
[07:18:38] <rwaldron> maybe?
[07:18:41] <rwaldron> dont rememeber
[07:18:47] <rwaldron> remember
[07:19:33] <louisremi> To be honest I didn't tried the code, I didn't have much time to write it and SSE wasn't the priority. But that was a mistake anyway.
[07:20:32] <rwaldron> its ok
[07:20:38] <rwaldron> i'm glad FF implemented it
[07:20:44] <louisremi> The problem now is that I don't have a reliable server to host the demo. Anyway, thank you for your help, it's greatly appreciated
[07:20:50] <rwaldron> puts the pressure on IE
[07:21:03] <rwaldron> ok, the article is def good
[07:21:21] <rwaldron> i like how you're showing this _other_ awesome feature
[07:22:41] <rwaldron> on one hand, i can see the benefit of writing out the event listeners individually in client.js -- easier for someone less experienced to readily understand... but I'm a lunatic and couldnt help myself... https://gist.github.com/1029280
[07:23:52] <louisremi> rwaldron: ;-) I'm glad you understand my decision of not being DRY this time
[07:24:41] <rwaldron> totally
[07:25:15] <rwaldron> if you compare the two side by side, yours has low barrier for entry -- anyone can understand it, which is GOOD :)
[07:25:24] <rwaldron> mine is like... "whaaaaa"
[07:25:28] <rwaldron> but easier to maintain
[07:25:29] <rwaldron> hahaha
[07:26:14] <rwaldron> anyway... this is really cool
[07:26:29] <rwaldron> i'm glad its not another run-of-the-mill tutorial
[07:26:48] <rwaldron> and that you're showing a really awesome aspect of EventSource
[07:27:03] <rwaldron> one of these days i'm going to re-write jQuery.EventSource
[07:27:10] <rwaldron> I kind of hate it now
[07:28:40] <louisremi> lol

[07:29:58] <rwaldron> louisremi ^^
[07:30:04] <rwaldron> i had JUST tweeted that
[07:30:07] <rwaldron> :D
[07:30:20] <louisremi> rwaldron: ok! :D
[07:30:29] <rwaldron> so, i guess its ok to tweet now?
[07:33:45] <louisremi> rwaldron: of course !
[07:33:52] <rwaldron> dunzo
[07:34:08] <miketaylr> louisremi: FYI SSE are in Opera too :)

[07:34:41] <louisremi> miketaylr: I'm going to update the article immediatly, no reason not to state it
[07:34:48] <rwaldron> good man
[07:34:52] <rwaldron> thanks miketaylr

[07:35:52] <louisremi> thanks
[07:36:27] <miketaylr> the custom events are cool
[07:43:57] <gf3> who was I talking to about inline documentation? anyway, this: http://zachholman.com/posts/documentation/
[07:53:10] <rwaldron> gf3 i think maybe snoveR?
[07:53:13] <rwaldron> snover*
[07:53:36] <gf3> I think it was jaubourg (sp?)
[07:53:51] <ajpiano> i think it was kswedberg
[07:54:02] <rwaldron> oh, maybe... i was thinking of snover's desire to parse docs...
[07:54:08] <kswedberg> ohai
[07:54:10] <rwaldron> gf3 this is the second article by that dude that I've really liked
[07:54:20] <rwaldron> ajpiano you never emailed bugs team
[07:54:26] <gf3> rwaldron: yeah, he's a super smart guy
[07:54:30] <rwaldron> timmywil needs to book a flight
[07:54:43] <ajpiano> rwaldron: he's comin in next week?
[07:54:49] <rwaldron> um...
[07:54:54] <ajpiano> ok
[07:54:55] <ajpiano> yah
[07:55:06] <rwaldron> we're having a bocoup bugs sprint
[07:55:15] <rwaldron> and JohnResig wanted timmywil to come to boston
[07:55:26] <rwaldron> and it centered around you coming to boston
[07:55:29] <ajpiano> ah ok
[07:55:33] <rwaldron> because everyone else is flexible
[07:55:42] <rwaldron> which is why i asked you to email the bugs team mailing list
[07:55:44] <rwaldron> :P
[07:56:29] <ajpiano> ah ok
[07:56:55] <rwaldron> <333
[07:57:22] <kswedberg> gf3: I like the idea of inline documentation in theory. and for a lot of projects it makes a lot of sense.
[07:57:31] <gf3> "but..."
[07:57:35] <kswedberg> :)
[07:59:00] <kswedberg> but currently the json output of the documentation, which doesn't even include any of the examples, is ~550kb
[07:59:26] <kswedberg> that's a lot of documentation to put into the jQuery source.
[08:21:05] <ben_alman> ajpiano, are we going to meet at 12 here first then figure out what to do?
[08:21:12] <ajpiano> yeah
[08:21:17] <ben_alman> ok, great
[08:21:21] <ajpiano> may as well use #jquery-meeting i guess
[08:21:22] <ben_alman> have you had time to look at my stuff?
[08:21:42] <ben_alman> i don't expect people will have looked at it, but i am hoping i'll be surprised
[08:22:03] <ajpiano> i read all the e-mails from yesterday
[08:22:13] <ben_alman> i'm really excited to have some kind of build tool for this stuff
[08:22:22] <ben_alman> i'm looking into node-powered docs generation tools
[08:22:28] <ajpiano> i noticed :p
[08:22:34] <ben_alman> i saw one that tooc jsdoc style comments and generated markdown files from them
[08:22:38] <ben_alman> which would be super sweet
[08:22:43] <ben_alman> then it just "works" in github
[08:23:46] <ben_alman> don't think i like this one, which is like docco but with animations http://visionmedia.github.com/dox/
[08:23:49] <ben_alman> seems weird to me
[08:23:59] <ben_alman> i don't need to show code
[08:24:01] <ben_alman> just documentation
[08:24:18] <ben_alman> i'm looking @ https://github.com/Pita/doc.md
[08:26:16] <ajpiano> well, let's focus on the plugin.json first
[08:26:20] <ajpiano> :p
[08:26:27] <ben_alman> yes i'm just thinking next steps as well
[08:26:43] <ben_alman> i have to keep moving on this to make sure i finish it
[08:27:01] <ajpiano> yah
[09:00:55] <ajpiano> hey gnarf danheberden ben_alman jzaefferer rworth
[09:01:00] <ajpiano> TO #jquery-meeting!
[09:01:17] <ben_alman> k
[12:01:52] <pulco> hi, can someone help me ?
[12:03:44] <jdalton> tried #jquery ?
[12:03:47] <danheberdn> pulco support is in #jquery (which i see you're already in) - ask away in there :)
[12:04:55] <pulco> thank u, i thought #here was made to help
[12:06:38] <pulco> i made an accordion list and in this list, i create a pop-up
[12:07:02] <pulco> but it appears behind the accordion :/
[12:08:17] <pulco> i tried to solve this problem by using the z-index in the css
[12:08:34] <pulco> but it didn't worked at all
[12:08:54] <pulco> got any idea about it ?
[12:11:23] <ajpiano> pulco: you didn't change channels, and if you do, please provide a code sample (there) using a live demo site like jsfiddle.net or at least a pastebin, hard to tell just from a description like that.
[12:13:13] <pulco> oups brb
[12:20:55] <ben_alman> danheberden, do you know what the @@ at the beginning of lines in jQuery's Makefile are?
[12:20:59] <ben_alman> i've never used @@ before
[12:21:05] <ben_alman> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/Makefile
[12:21:18] <ben_alman> i'm exploring doing the jqbuild tool as a makefile
[12:21:45] <danheberden> pretty sure that just hides the output
[12:21:54] <ben_alman> o
[12:22:09] <ben_alman> why would you hide @@echo "jQuery build complete."
[12:22:56] <ben_alman> well i'm going to keep poking around
[12:23:31] <danheberden> i'm no built master, i'd talk to AzaToth
[12:23:36] <danheberden> *build
[12:23:50] <ben_alman> i tweetz0red
[12:32:08] * AzaToth feels poked
[12:32:18] <ben_alman> AzaToth, you a make master?
[12:32:30] <AzaToth> everything is relative
[12:32:30] <ben_alman> i'm trying to learn and have this http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html
[12:32:36] <ben_alman> didn't know if there was a better place to start
[12:32:43] <AzaToth> it's the one and only
[12:32:47] <ben_alman> okeedokee
[12:32:52] <ben_alman> i guess i'll just start reading
[12:32:56] <AzaToth> hehe
[12:37:17] <AzaToth> ben_alman: I think it should be simple @
[12:38:20] <AzaToth> dunny why I made two of them
[12:38:26] <ben_alman> k
[12:38:29] <ben_alman> what does @ do
[12:38:45] <AzaToth> it will hide the command executed
[12:38:49] <ben_alman> ok then
[12:38:54] <ben_alman> why would you hide echos
[12:38:54] <AzaToth> i.e. it will not print "echo foo"
[12:38:58] <ben_alman> why not just comment the echo out
[12:39:03] <ben_alman> oh i c
[12:39:12] <ben_alman> like @ in dos
[12:39:13] <ben_alman> nm
[12:39:15] <AzaToth> heh
[12:39:21] <ben_alman> didn't realize it printed out the line before executing it
[12:39:48] <AzaToth> it usually does
[12:40:12] <AzaToth> but when you are jsut echoing stuff to the screen, you are not the interested in the invocation command to be displayed
[12:40:24] <ben_alman> yes understood
[12:40:34] <ben_alman> if i had seen it as @ not @@ i might've made the connection
[12:40:35] <AzaToth> it can also be used when you want to do "pretty" CC
[12:40:39] <AzaToth> ツ
[12:41:12] <ben_alman> is there any way to specify a heredoc in a Makefile?
[12:41:39] <AzaToth> you can do an define
[12:42:07] <AzaToth> but I wouldn't suggest using heredoc ツ
[12:42:21] <AzaToth> heredoc is fucked up normally for me
[12:42:25] <ben_alman> k
[12:42:50] <AzaToth> why do you wonder?
[12:43:11] <ben_alman> in my ideal world i would be able to have ALL the functionality i care about in the Makefile
[12:43:22] <ben_alman> it might not be possible
[12:43:51] <AzaToth> what about ALL the functionallity danheberden cares about?
[12:44:03] <ben_alman> i'm making a makefile for plugin authoring
[12:44:07] <ben_alman> or looking into it, at least
[12:44:19] <ben_alman> not for jquery core
[12:44:19] <AzaToth> what functionallity are you refering to?
[12:44:26] <ben_alman> well
[12:44:39] <ben_alman> jshint binary takes a --config filename
[12:44:42] <danheberden> AzaToth there-in lies the problem, i just don't care
[12:44:50] <AzaToth> danheberden: ツ
[12:44:51] <ben_alman> so if i want to pass it options, i'd need to have an options file
[12:45:02] <AzaToth> ok
[12:45:21] <ben_alman> it would be nice if i could generate a default options file, perhaps from data stored in the Makefile
[12:45:30] <ben_alman> which would be easier as a heredoc
[12:45:33] <ben_alman> of sorts
[12:45:35] <AzaToth> need to fix the blody jshint to take options on the command line
[12:45:41] <ben_alman> yeah true
[12:49:09] <ben_alman> i'm not really thrilled about the idea of having a whole jquery-plugin-makefile repo that i need to include as a submodule
[12:49:34] <AzaToth> it's simple ツ
[12:49:37] <ben_alman> because then i'd need to link the Makefile from the submodule to the parent folder, or something
[12:49:39] <ben_alman> right?
[12:50:22] <ben_alman> so say i have a repo jqp-make that has the file Makefile in it
[12:50:24] <AzaToth> https://gist.github.com/1030091
[12:50:42] <AzaToth> ben_alman: ↑
[12:51:26] <ben_alman> AzaToth, it strips out linebreaks
[12:52:04] <AzaToth> ben_alman: have you even tested above makefile?
[12:52:26] <ben_alman> ah needed quotes
[12:52:50] <ben_alman> neat
[12:54:14] <AzaToth> it's uglu
[12:54:18] <AzaToth> ugly*
[12:54:37] <AzaToth> you are exporting the defined variable to the shell, and then use it from there
[12:54:51] <ben_alman> yeah, weird
[13:52:41] <cimi> hello everyone
[13:52:43] <cimi> is there any way of running the jQuery test suite on the final build file?
[13:52:59] <cimi> I don't want to include ../src/core.js etc.
[13:53:06] <cimi> but just ../dist/jquery.js
[13:53:41] <cimi> I noticed the test suite automatically re-includes the small modules at teardown (I guess)
[13:53:55] <cimi> I want to benchmark some minifiers and I need to check their correctness
[13:54:11] <cimi> I thought the test suite would be ideal for that
[13:57:22] <rwaldron> I'm not sure I follow
[13:57:28] <rwaldron> i understand what you'd like to do
[13:57:46] <rwaldron> but I dont see how the test suite can help you with benchmarking minifiers
[13:59:04] <cimi> it helps me prove that the minification was correct
[13:59:14] <rwaldron> right
[13:59:56] <rwaldron> but how does that apply to benchmarking minifiers?
[13:59:57] <cimi> if it works for jquery.js, then it should work for yui-jquery.js, [my-minifier]-jquery.js :) etc.
[14:00:02] <rwaldron> i'm just trying to understand so i can help you
[14:00:12] <rwaldron> ok...
[14:00:15] <rwaldron> i see what you mean
[14:00:26] <rwaldron> when i think benchmark, i think performance tests
[14:00:28] <rwaldron> sorry
[14:00:52] <cimi> I also have those in my stack, but it's not relevant to the problem
[14:01:00] <cimi> sorry for the ambiguity
[14:01:05] <cimi> is there any way to do this?
[14:01:24] <rwaldron> outside of making a copy of index.html and removing the module scripts?
[14:01:34] <cimi> yep, that doesn't work
[14:01:39] <cimi> I tried it
[14:01:40] <rwaldron> hm.
[14:01:50] <rwaldron> let me try something
[14:01:59] <cimi> cool, thanks :)
[14:05:04] <gnarf> rwaldron: i think setting the test suite up to be able to run vs. minified jQuery was an item on some list somewhere...
[14:06:07] <gnarf> just mentioning it cuz if you get it working it might be nice to save a "test-dist.html" and "test-min.html" or something
[14:06:34] <gnarf> cimi: ^^^
[14:07:03] <rwaldron> gnarf it looks like it was started
[14:07:06] <rwaldron> not finished
[14:07:12] <rwaldron> there is a button that doesnt do anything
[14:08:32] <rwaldron> wtf.
[14:08:44] <rwaldron> there is a ton of failures going on
[14:08:54] <cimi> what I noticed was that when trying to run it with jquery.js (not minified, but single-file) it re-imported the module files after running a test module
[14:09:03] <cimi> there were a lot of requests in the chrome console
[14:09:30] <cimi> it's the first time I've tried to do this, so I'm not really sure if this should happen
[14:09:30] <rwaldron> yeah, something zany is going on
[14:09:58] <rwaldron> the problem is that the suite was hand-crafted to run the modules last fall :\
[14:11:54] <cimi> hmm... so checking out a tag before that should work?
[14:12:25] <cimi> in my case, I'm not really interested in having the latest version
[14:15:55] <rwaldron> in that case, yes
[14:15:59] <rwaldron> that would work
[14:16:38] <rwaldron> cimi before this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/8effe3a7dee91c833cc1774646da9d743600c64c
[14:17:51] <cimi> thanks, I'll try it and tell you how it went
[14:47:46] <timmywil> rwaldron: ping
[14:47:59] <rwaldron> busy atm
[14:48:02] <rwaldron> gimme a min
[14:49:58] <timmywil> gnarf: after you make, you can click minified in the test suite
[14:50:09] <timmywil> already done
[14:50:51] <gnarf> cimi: ^^
[14:52:14] <cimi> I tried it with 1.4
[14:52:36] <cimi> and it fails, maybe it's because of sizzle
[14:53:02] <cimi> I had to modify the Makefile to point to the correct sizzle repo (it wasn't jeresig/sizzle anymore)
[14:53:54] <cimi> the generated jquery.js has errors, I'm guessing it's because it's out of sync with sizzle, I can't think of anything else since it's supposed to be a stable tag
[14:54:06] <rwaldron> timmywil yo
[14:54:28] <timmywil> rwaldron: hey, what's this about dimensions?
[14:54:47] <rwaldron> cimi the problem is there is no record of  which sizzle worked with which jquery version
[14:54:55] <rwaldron> timmywil i reported as much as i know
[14:55:11] <timmywil> rwaldron: cause I get passes in all browsers
[14:55:12] <rwaldron> that shit is failing like kwazy on the master branch
[14:55:16] <rwaldron> ok np
[14:55:29] <rwaldron> i was running it in chrome 13, so possibly a beta bug
[14:55:33] <rwaldron> no worries
[14:55:44] <cimi> me too, also in chrome dev
[14:55:46] <timmywil> rwaldron: hmm, i tried 14 as well
[14:57:27] <timmywil> so one of us has something off in our setups
[14:57:44] <timmywil> or browser zoom
[14:58:24] <timmywil> eh, that only affects offset
[14:58:34] <timmywil> idk
[15:07:22] <rwaldron> timmywil maybe stop writing code that breaks everything?
[15:07:25] <rwaldron> :P
[15:07:27] <rwaldron> hehehehehe
[15:07:33] <timmywil> NO U
[15:29:01] <cimi> I'm out, thanks for the help!
[15:29:28] <cimi> still doesn't work, but it's late for me, I'll try tomorrow
[15:29:39] <cimi> cheers
