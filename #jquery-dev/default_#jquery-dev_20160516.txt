[12:56:41] <m_gol> markelog: if I understand it right, then jQuery fires focusout, blur, focusin, focus, the spec focusout, focusin, blur, focus and Chrome blur, focusout, focusin, focus?
[12:57:16] <DaveMethvin> i thought we were spec...let me check
[12:57:27] <m_gol> and in the spec the focus is lost before blur fires and gained before focus fires
[12:57:33] <m_gol> the spec is here: https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#events-focusevent-event-order
[12:58:29] <DaveMethvin> whoa not the way i remembered it at all :/
[12:59:13] <DaveMethvin> oh what about the .focus() method?
[13:01:11] <DaveMethvin> gah i don't have 2 hours to read this https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#focus-update-steps :)
[13:02:49] <m_gol> https://jsfiddle.net/66znLhfw/2/
[13:04:12] <m_gol> so we have three different behaviors and we're not following the spec either...
[13:04:16] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's user input, then there's .focus() method action too
[13:04:46] <DaveMethvin> well if they can't get it right then we can't be expected to fake it right either :)
[13:04:52] <DaveMethvin> gotta run for a few minutes
[13:06:13] <markelog> hm, that's weird, since ie had those events
[13:06:22] <markelog> and we didn't shadow them 
[13:06:41] <markelog> and ie behaviour was the spec behaviour
[13:07:19] <markelog> even mdn sells capturing approach for mitigating absence of the focus(in | out) methods
[13:13:03] <markelog> m_gol:yeah, you right, funny, no one really knows about it
[13:13:12] <markelog> don't know what to do in this situation
[13:13:27] <m_gol> ha, so we're doing sth different than IE, that sounds bad
[13:14:09] <markelog> timmywil:m_gol: then seems like we can't remove our support check, always shim them and document our behaviour
[13:14:24] <markelog> at least we will be consistent 
[13:14:36] <m_gol> if we're doing sth different than IE then it sounds we actually should remove the check
[13:14:40] <m_gol> and just shim everywhere
[13:14:52] <m_gol> especially that now we're not shimming just in IE which is an obsolete browser now
[13:14:57] <markelog> exactamundo
[13:15:30] <markelog> m_gol: would you mind creating an issue about it?
[13:15:35] <m_gol> yeah, just doing that
[13:15:43] <m_gol> I'll link to it here
[13:15:50] <markelog> it seems we can triage it as a bug and even do that in 3.0.1 or something
[13:16:21] <markelog> i would verify though, that ie behaviour is not as we expected it
[13:16:36] <markelog> maybe spec doesn't reflect no ones behaviour
[13:16:46] <markelog> oh man, what a mess!
[13:24:44] <DaveMethvin> wow, on a programmed DOM .focus() method, focusout/in is sync and focus/blur is async in ie11? https://jsfiddle.net/66znLhfw/3/ (
[13:24:50] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15mgol opened issue #3123: Shim focusin/focusout in all browsers? 02https://git.io/vrnYa
[13:25:55] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: focus/blur is always async in IE, isn't it?
[13:26:04] <m_gol> in Edge it's synchronous
[13:26:10] <m_gol> I created an issue
[13:26:44] <DaveMethvin> yes but it appears focusin/out is not!
[13:26:51] <m_gol> ah, interesting
[13:27:40] <DaveMethvin> so if you .focus() an element you get the focusout from the previous element, the focusin to that element, then the code continues and you get the blur/focus
[13:28:02] <DaveMethvin> i didn't recall that, wonder if it was in ie8 that way
[13:28:19] <m_gol> markelog: I checked, IE 11 order is following the spec
[13:28:45] <DaveMethvin> since we use focus/blur to piggyback focusin/out that's why we have a different order
[13:29:11] <m_gol> yeah but the fact we don't shim IE means it's now different than every other browser when used with jQuery
[13:29:43] <DaveMethvin> we had these discrepancies a lot with event order in IE
[13:29:56] <m_gol> also, I didn't know that Edge is actually different than Chrome/Safari
[13:30:17] <m_gol> because it fires focusout before blur, they agree on the rest of the order
[13:30:55] <DaveMethvin> i think the main thing people wanted in the shim was that focus and blur could bubble and be used with delegated events
[13:31:02] <DaveMethvin> the actual order isn't usually critical
[13:31:33] <m_gol> but what does not shimming IE actually buy us now?
[13:31:50] <DaveMethvin> yeah i dunno
[13:31:56] <DaveMethvin> other than letting native events fire
[13:32:04] <m_gol> it does leave IE's focus order spec-compliant but what value is in that if it's different everywhere else?
[13:32:29] <DaveMethvin> it depends on how critical the event order is
[13:32:50] <DaveMethvin> obvs it's so variable that nobody could depend on it :)
[13:33:15] <m_gol> no one will depend on the IE order since it's different everywhere else so if anyone depends on the order they depend on the jQuery Chrome/Firefox/Safari one which means it's broken in IE
[13:34:26] <DaveMethvin> well also the IE order is complicated by the fact that it's async
[13:38:13] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ok, so one problem with shimming everywhere would be that we'd make IE's focusin/focusout async as well, right?
[13:38:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think it would if that test is correct
[13:44:38] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: you're right
[13:44:41] <m_gol> https://jsfiddle.net/66znLhfw/6/
[13:45:36] <DaveMethvin> lol
[13:45:56] <DaveMethvin> that's probably why it is that way
[13:47:06] <m_gol> so we're basically screwed :)
[13:47:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[13:47:27] <DaveMethvin> but i don't think it's been a big problem in reality
[13:47:43] <DaveMethvin> most ppl don't depend on the event order of focusin vs blur
[13:51:33] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: OTH, we've had bug reports about async focus in IE so people are concerned about that
[13:51:46] <m_gol> and I don't remember bug reports about the event order here
[13:51:53] <DaveMethvin> right and async focus is super annoying
[13:52:20] <DaveMethvin> i think you could make an argument to fix async focus/blur by using focusin/out :)
[13:53:05] <m_gol> hahaha
[13:55:56] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: tbh that doesn't sound as such a bad idea ;P
[14:20:13] <gibson042> yeah, splendid... so Firefox can get synthetic focusin/focusout via focus/blur, and everyone else gets synthetic focus/blur via focusin/focusout
[14:20:27] <gibson042> is there an emoji for "shooting oneself in the head"?
[14:21:16] <DaveMethvin> "we don't care how you die, as long as it's painful"
[17:05:22] <m_gol> gibson042: it was half-ironic ;)
