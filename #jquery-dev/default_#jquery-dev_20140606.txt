[09:18:27] <dcherman> fyi, just noticed that the topic in #jquery was never updated when 2.1.1/1.11.1 was released if anyone is around
[09:20:36] <scott_gonzalez> Does it even make sense to keep the version numbers in the topic?
[09:21:27] <dcherman> tbh no, but if they're there, they should be up to date probably, else just dump em
[09:21:31] <m_gol> yeah, I've just thought the same
[09:21:43] <m_gol> better to dump them IMO
[09:29:38] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I can't op myself, so we'll need to wait for ajpiano or someone else.
[09:29:39] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps gnarf can give me op.
[09:41:42] <shoky> scott_gonzalez: there you go ;p
[09:42:19] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks :-)
[09:42:39] <scott_gonzalez> dcherman: Topic updated.
[09:44:11] <dcherman> scott_gonzalez: sweet, tks
[13:22:28] <Krinkle> mikesherov: Thinking of a patch release for jscs soon?
[13:22:39] <Krinkle> Afaik that'll automatically apply to grunt since it uses ~
[13:22:47] <Krinkle> Can't wait to start using it :)

[13:49:10] <leobalter> I hate coveralls automatic comments on my PRs
[13:58:28] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf mikesherov: Can one of you review https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/pull/68?
