[07:47:13] <orkel> DaveMethvin gibson042 are you there?
[07:47:23] <DaveMethvin> yep
[07:47:25] <DaveMethvin> saw your pull
[07:48:04] <orkel> Hi, i'm actually want to ask about the other thing
[07:48:12] <orkel> Wanna make sure we on the same page here about 13265 (http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13265) â€“ we decided to ignore text nodes right? i.e. â€“Â http://jsfiddle.net/b5Ret/
[07:48:36] <DaveMethvin> i think we did, right gibson042?
[07:49:03] <DaveMethvin> in the meeting on monday i mentioned i wanted to know more
[07:49:08] <DaveMethvin> if you look at the angular code
[07:49:19] <DaveMethvin> they are basically having to deal with the same text node dilemma
[07:49:40] <DaveMethvin> it woudl be great to have full text node support but it seems too messy to do
[07:49:58] <DaveMethvin> and a case like $(textnode).something() is pretty contrived imo
[07:50:10] <DaveMethvin> just like $(commentnode) 
[07:50:25] <orkel> i'm sure hope nobody use code like that
[07:50:37] <DaveMethvin> haha, you just KNOW someone does
[07:50:41] <DaveMethvin> for some crazy reason
[07:51:19] <DaveMethvin> so i will touch base with the angular guys and explain
[07:51:46] <orkel> cool!
[07:52:47] <orkel> Okey, i will make pull for 13265 then, 1.9.1 is scheduled today right? If gibson will have some objections, we can talk about it there
[07:54:03] <DaveMethvin> i am hoping 1.9.1 ships today, but even if it doesn't i want to have as much landed as soon as possible

[11:23:45] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: seems like feeding BrowserStack our splunk logs is helping. Tests are running quite fast, and we loose less browsers.
[11:23:58] <Krinkle> Jep :)
[11:24:40] <jzaefferer> We're still loosing browsers, but the ratio got a lot better
[11:24:40] <DaveMethvin> i emailed them on the firefox issue and got a quick response
[11:35:11] <jzaefferer> okay
[11:35:21] <jzaefferer> can you CC me and Krinkle on stuff like that?
[11:55:41] <gnarf> is there a jquery testing google group?
[11:56:03] <gnarf> but yeah, I'd be interested in a CC on those too ;)
[11:58:00] <DaveMethvin> sounds like a group would be handy

[14:06:15] <b-ot> timmywil: Timmy Willison (5m 29s ago): Maintain original sort order in detached node sorting in Webkit. Fixes jQuery #13331.
[14:06:30] <timmywil> pretty much the same approach, except with a support test
[14:07:06] <timmywil> in fact, mostly your code, just with a support test :)
[14:08:14] <timmywil> I'm weary of all the top scope vars we have so I say we just slice for sortOrder every time.
[14:08:30] <timmywil> sortInput*
[14:08:57] <timmywil> oo
[14:09:09] <timmywil> oh nvm
[14:09:39] <timmywil> yea, we still need it even if sortDisconnected is not supported
[14:10:15] <timmywil> cause returning 0 isn't always enough even if it is supportedâ€¦. so yea

[14:35:10] <gibson042> timmywil: +1 on the support test; see my comments about only doing slice/indexOf.call for environments failing it
[14:36:49] <timmywil> gibson042: 0 was fine?
[14:37:07] <gibson042> except in Webkit, yeah
[14:37:17] <gibson042> oh, wait
[14:37:28] <gibson042> I'm not sure now
[14:37:38] <gibson042> hmmm
[14:37:52] <timmywil> maybe it was, did we only run into problems in Webkit on disconnected nodes?
[14:38:02] <gibson042> yes, because everyone does a stable sort
[14:38:31] <timmywil> why does webkit change the order when we return 0 in this case?
[14:38:38] <gibson042> now that I'm thinking on it more, the problem was that disconnected nodes weren't recognized as such
[14:39:03] <timmywil> i guess we don't know the answer to that question
[14:39:06] <gibson042> you might be able to get rid of the indexOf stuff entirely
[14:39:10] <gibson042> I'd try it
[14:39:57] <timmywil> yea I did, but it moves stuff around
[14:39:59] <timmywil> :P
[14:40:06] <gibson042> oh well
[14:40:20] <timmywil> lemme try tying with the support test
[14:40:24] <gibson042> it's certainly the most defensive approach, but also the slowest
[14:41:28] <gibson042> but it *should* be true that we can return 0 whenever we get a pair of disconnected nodes
[14:41:38] <timmywil> yes it should
[14:42:07] <timmywil> but I guess it's not guaranteed
[14:43:13] <gibson042> well, it was worth a shot
[14:43:26] <timmywil> oh I'm still trying
[14:46:18] <timmywil> ok, how bout this https://github.com/timmywil/sizzle/commit/6a6866c000b7a795527788292567032d13dded7f
[14:46:18] <b-ot> timmywil: Timmy Willison (45m 33s ago): Maintain original sort order in detached node sorting in Webkit. Fixes jQuery #13331.
[14:49:10] <timmywil> it passes, maybe we could go with that until it fails :)
[14:51:25] <gibson042> tested in Firefox and Opera?
[14:52:02] <timmywil> sortDisconnected => sortDetached saves us 2 bytes
[14:52:13] <gibson042> :)
[14:53:10] <gibson042> what about `support.sortDisconnected` â†’ `!sortInput` in the function?
[14:53:54] <timmywil> heh, genious

[14:54:45] <doesallmagic> dave.methvin: Fix #13335. Remove "use strict".
[14:55:04] <gibson042> ok, I'm taking off for now but this looks good to me
[14:55:17] <gibson042> oh; one more thing
[14:55:52] <gibson042> in the support test, `Â &&Â div2.compareDocumentPosition` is unnecessary
[14:56:21] <gibson042> but I'd still keep it if gzip says to ;)
[14:56:40] <timmywil> yea I suppose so since it was created the same way
[14:57:37] <timmywil> using sortInput in the function saves 4
[14:58:32] <timmywil> and 2 more for the last thing
