[08:40:10] <DaveMethvin> sorry about Trac miketaylr, we're working on it but it's a mess
[08:40:17] <DaveMethvin> i can rarely even get the page to load
[08:40:27] <miketaylr> yeah it timed out for me trying to log in
[08:40:28] <miketaylr> shrugs

[08:40:56] <miketaylr> DaveMethvin: short of it is the bug doesn't reproduce in nightly
[08:41:04] <miketaylr> will comment that eventually
[08:41:14] <DaveMethvin> ok good, so maybe it's moot
[08:41:30] <DaveMethvin> it was a strange one, definitely something happening async when it shouldn't

[14:01:56] <angus_c> hello #jquery-dev
[14:02:00] <angus_c> I have a question
[14:02:54] <angus_c> we recently upgraded from 1.8.3 to to 1.11.1 
[14:03:06] <angus_c> and focus is behaving oddly
[14:03:32] <angus_c> check out this example http://jsbin.com/jepemo/1/edit?html,js,output
[14:03:33] <DaveMethvin> hey angus_c, this sounds like a #jquery thing
[14:03:49] <angus_c> oh ok, #jquery-ot told me to come here
[14:04:13] <DaveMethvin> what the heck does -ot know :)
[14:04:36] <DaveMethvin> and btw, focus is one of the hardest problems in computer science it seems
[14:05:07] <angus_c> yes and yes
[14:06:53] <miketaylr> my bad DaveMethvin
[14:07:09] <DaveMethvin> miketaylr: you have a bad?
[14:07:11] <DaveMethvin> NO!
[14:07:20] <miketaylr> it sounded like angus_c was dealing with some kind of regression
[14:07:36] <miketaylr> and i thought you probably were bored and had nothing else to do
[14:07:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah, always !
[14:07:47] <miketaylr> :)~
[14:07:58] <DaveMethvin> if i had to guess it would be b/c we now use real DOM focus for focus
[14:08:08] <DaveMethvin> and every browser hoses that except chrome it seems
[14:08:27] <DaveMethvin> firefox hoses it, and ie hoses it with gold leaf cluster
[14:10:21] <DaveMethvin> so the short answer is that yes, there was a behavior change because we expect DOM .focus() to work property
[14:10:23] <DaveMethvin> properly
[14:10:28] <DaveMethvin> but it doesn't always do that
[14:10:33] <miketaylr> angus_c: ^^
[14:10:42] <miketaylr> now you gotta give him 141 chars limit
[14:10:58] <miketaylr> maybe 142 if he's telling the truth
[14:12:25] <DaveMethvin> in later jquery we fire DOM .focus() rather than trying to execute focus handlers manually, so that the event will happen in the proper order
[14:12:28] <angus_c> miketaylr, DaveMethvin steady on now, even dick costolo only gets 142
[14:12:40] <DaveMethvin> because the events happening in the wrong order was a bug too
[14:13:05] <miketaylr> browsers are the worst
[14:13:23] <DaveMethvin> i'd never work for a company that made one of those piles of crap 
[14:13:31] <miketaylr> same
[14:13:34] <DaveMethvin> lol
[14:13:34] <miketaylr> >_<
[14:15:20] <angus_c> so the upshot is you have to be focused on the window for DOM .focus() to take effect?
[14:15:58] <DaveMethvin> MAN i hate focus
[14:16:19] <DaveMethvin> so if you don't have the window focused, did the focus occur?
[14:16:25] <DaveMethvin> I DUNNO
[14:16:45] <DaveMethvin> (see tree, forest controversy)
[14:18:10] <angus_c> if the window was not focused - the element used to still focus
[14:18:28] <DaveMethvin> only b/c we executed the focus events that were attached
[14:18:28] <angus_c> which browser-wise doesn't make sense really
[14:18:34] <angus_c> but test-wise was a godsend
[14:18:37] <DaveMethvin> not because Firefox or Chrome or IE did anything
[14:18:38] <angus_c> yes
[14:18:58] <DaveMethvin> tests aren't necessarily reality tho
[14:19:12] <angus_c> agree totally
[14:19:17] <dcherman> it's pretty terrible if `focus` fires and document.activeElement is a lie
[14:19:25] <angus_c> yes
[14:19:30] <DaveMethvin> I could get a good look at a T-bone steak by sticking my head up a bulls ass, but don't you think I would rather take a butchers word for it?
[14:19:37] <DaveMethvin> -- "tommy boy"
[14:20:15] <DaveMethvin> so again, the whole reason we changed our approach was to make it so that .focus() fired the events in the correct order
[14:20:25] <angus_c> the bull would prefer that too
[14:20:28] <DaveMethvin> but of course that depended on the browser doing things reasonable
[14:20:30] <DaveMethvin> :)
[14:20:39] <angus_c> ok cool - sounds good
[14:20:43] <angus_c> we should start the test by focusing the window I guess
[14:20:45] <angus_c> tahnks!
[14:20:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah, good luck!
[14:20:57] <DaveMethvin> our unit tests have this same problem angus_c 
[14:21:01] <DaveMethvin> it's a nightmare
[14:21:33] <DaveMethvin> guys like miketaylr sittin around drinking mint juleps, thinking "how can we make this harder?"
[14:22:50] <miketaylr> that's mostly accurate
[14:22:56] <miketaylr> we louge in hammocks more than sit
[14:23:14] <DaveMethvin> and this coming from a guy who HATES Southern Comfort booze
[14:25:03] <DaveMethvin> obtw dcherman i agree, that's one of the many reasons why we tried to play within the rules
[14:25:54] <DaveMethvin> things like DOM .focus() method not firing the focus handlers if you do it multiple times, that's a surprise to someone who calls the jQuery .focus() method twice
[14:26:23] <dcherman> ya, it's not your fault, especially since there's no reasonable workaround.  scummy browsers imo.
[14:26:38] <DaveMethvin> it's just the fuzzy definition of what focus means
[14:27:01] <DaveMethvin> with something like click i want 3 calls for 3 clicks
[14:27:18] <DaveMethvin> but if focus never left an element, maybe only the first time is right?
[14:29:52] <dcherman> what's the alternative?  focus something multiple times?  but then how would that differ from click :/
[14:30:20] <dcherman> there's tab of course, but how many times do you hit tab once and end up back on the same element focus wise
[14:30:26] <angus_c> would have had miketaylr down as more of a creme de menthe guy
[14:31:05] <DaveMethvin> any drink where he could stick out his pinky while holding it
[14:31:18] <angus_c> yes
[14:32:03] <miketaylr> that's actually ohw i type
[14:32:07] <miketaylr> hence all the typos
