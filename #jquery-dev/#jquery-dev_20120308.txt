[04:36:25] <Krinkle> getting that in the frame on some swarm clients

[04:38:09] <Krinkle> 1) bogus (copy paste fail), 2) link shown in the 404, 3) url
[04:59:56] <jaubourg> hey all
[05:01:52] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery build #281: STILL FAILING in 2 min 2 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery/281/
[05:30:48] <DaveMethvin> .
[06:30:18] <jaubourg> poor Dave
[06:30:45] <jaubourg> forced to land IE-only perf boosts
[06:30:49] <jaubourg> :/
[06:48:57] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: i just don't like dealing with trivial pull requests, they aren't worth it. And then those discussions start which waste even MORE time and I'm like, "Ok, I'll land this and STFU."
[06:49:38] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: so i don't know what was goign on with that php test harness change but we didn't need it for 1.7.2 so backing it out was easiest
[06:49:49] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron thought maybe it was not putting out the correct headers
[07:03:50] <jaubourg> yes, weird, but heh, no biggy
[07:04:07] <jaubourg> but god is testSwarm unstable
[07:04:45] <DaveMethvin> if we could get ONE clean test run i'd feel better
[07:04:56] <DaveMethvin> right now every run fails so it's not as useful as could be
[07:05:04] <DaveMethvin> very annoying
[07:05:50] <DaveMethvin> if failure was infrequent then we'd be able to pay attention to the jq-jenkins messages here and it would be easier to spot regressions
[08:07:55] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone know what's going on with Firefox 3.6 on Swarm? http://swarm.jquery.org/?state=runresults&run_id=17&client_id=63
[08:07:59] <scott_gonzalez> The error at the bottom.
[08:09:46] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: I haven't seen that one
[08:11:56] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's in the swarm integration.
[08:12:06] <scott_gonzalez> So it's tricky to investigate.
[08:12:47] <DaveMethvin> yeah i had one of those yesterday, worked fine locally
[08:14:39] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Do you know what is?
[08:15:10] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: i noticed you're using 1.4.0pre QUnit, we're still on 1.2
[08:15:17] <scott_gonzalez> Does view. update on an interval or from a hook?
[08:15:19] <DaveMethvin> i meant to ask jzaefferer if 1.3 was safe :)
[08:15:32] <scott_gonzalez> Wait for 1.4.0, coming in a few days.
[08:15:38] <scott_gonzalez> We couldn't use 1.3.0 because of a bug.
[08:15:56] <scott_gonzalez> That change to QUnit.reset() which did the cloning of the fixture element caused problems for us.
[08:16:09] <scott_gonzalez> It was causing Firefox to remember form values between runs.
[08:17:53] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/unit/all-active.html :-)
[08:18:08] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
[08:18:34] <DaveMethvin> wow and they pass even. You shouldn't have! :P
[08:19:31] <scott_gonzalez> I know. I'm too nice :-)
[08:20:36] <scott_gonzalez> 3,150 active tests...not too bad.
[08:20:43] <scott_gonzalez> It'll be nice when the whole suite is active.
[08:21:52] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be cool if we could run specific core tests inside the UI suite.
[08:22:06] <scott_gonzalez> Like .show(), .hide(), .addClass(), etc.
[08:22:13] <scott_gonzalez> Everything we extend.
[08:22:29] <scott_gonzalez> The best we can probably do is just copy/paste.
[08:22:30] <DaveMethvin> i'd definitely like to do some more work on the unit tests
[08:22:51] <DaveMethvin> i'd also like to know how good our coverage is
[08:23:15] <DaveMethvin> ok, -git is working with the active list
[08:24:08] <DaveMethvin> guess i've got more work to do then, there should be at least one UI thing breaking before we release :-D
[08:24:13] <DaveMethvin> we did a much better job on mobile
[08:25:14] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[08:30:03] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I realized today that UI supports a 3 year old version of core.
[08:30:16] <scott_gonzalez> People need to upgrade. For realz.
[08:31:32] <scott_gonzalez> I feel a little bad requiring 1.6+ for UI 1.9 looking at the chart on http://blog.builtwith.com/2011/10/31/jquery-version-and-usage-report/
[08:31:55] <scott_gonzalez> But it's pretty nice to be able to use new features :-)
[08:32:00] <DaveMethvin> yep
[08:32:09] <DaveMethvin> amazon.com is on 1.2.6
[08:32:15] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery UI 2.0 will require jquery-git :-P
[08:32:30] <DaveMethvin> now that's what i' talking about
[08:32:55] <DaveMethvin> "To ensure proper function of jQuery UI 2.0, do not cache jQuery core for more than one hour."
[08:33:32] <scott_gonzalez> first line inside the main closure:
[08:33:33] <scott_gonzalez> if ( !/Live From Git/.test( $.fn.jquery ) ) { return; }
[08:34:04] <DaveMethvin> part of me is laughing but the other part is thinking, hell yeah!
[08:34:12] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:24:50] <johnbender> Anyone know if there are plans for a jquery con sf this year?
[09:25:09] <ajpiano> johnbender: yes, late june
[09:25:14] <johnbender> ajpiano: hell yah
[09:25:25] <johnbender> ajpiano: i haz talks :)
[09:25:25] <ajpiano> johnbender: *IN* san fran
[09:25:27] <ajpiano> :)
[09:28:31] <johnbender> rwaldron: had a chance to look at the sequence Qunit addon?
[09:28:44] <johnbender> don't mean to pester you, just curious
[09:34:35] <rwaldron> johnbender holy shit, I completely forgot
[09:34:42] <rwaldron> thank you for reminding me
[09:40:53] <johnbender> rwaldron: no worries! I'm curious to see if it's helpful to you
[13:00:42] <johnbender> Anyone know folks who might be working on/for Oreilly's fluentconf?
[13:00:49] <johnbender> I'm not ashamed to beg
[14:59:33] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin scott_gonzalez: I don't know what's going on with Firefox 3.6/TestSwarm - one of these days we need to dig into those...
[15:03:05] <Krinkle> hm..
[15:03:11] <Krinkle> what's going on
[15:03:25] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1/
[15:03:28] <Krinkle> FF 3.6 looks good
[15:03:40] <Krinkle> FF 10 is the first FF column
[15:03:46] <Krinkle> (it's sorted as string)
[15:03:52] <Krinkle> (1, 10, 2, 3)
[15:04:03] <Krinkle> hover for tooltip
[15:04:39] <Krinkle> I've got a bunch of browsers in the swarm as well (chrome, safari, ff 3.6, all opera)
[15:40:23] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I believe state=wipe isn't being run
[15:40:29] <Krinkle> can you fix that on swarm.jquery ?
[15:40:39] <Krinkle> some stay yellow and have no browsers connected
[15:40:47] <Krinkle> I ran it manually just now and it fixed a bunch of stalling ones
[15:41:09] <Krinkle> It was forgotten last time it was reinstalled as well, and the time before that :-/
