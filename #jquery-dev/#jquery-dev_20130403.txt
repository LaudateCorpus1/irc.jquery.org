[08:30:05] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I just forwarded you something

[08:57:23] <doesallmagic> Rick Waldron: Fixes #13714. jQuery.globalEval gotcha w/ strings that contain valid, prologue position strict mode pragma
[09:36:19] <Krinkle> rwaldron: wtf is with testswarm/browserstack?
[09:36:27] <Krinkle> Anyone know when it started not doing anything?
[09:37:06] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle just a day or so ago it was doing its normal thing, failing miserably and inexplicably
[09:37:11] <DaveMethvin> so this must be new behavior
[09:37:25] <Krinkle> well, it's not failing, it's not running: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/251
[09:37:30] <Krinkle> testswarm is fine but no browsers are running tests.
[09:37:32] <DaveMethvin> i was seeing all the oldie runs break
[09:37:45] <Krinkle> Hm.. where is that?
[09:38:15] <Krinkle> !splink
[09:38:17] <Krinkle> !splunk
[09:38:56] <Krinkle> https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/
[09:39:30] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/245 was close enough for me ... dunno what is up today
[09:41:01] <Krinkle> The "attributes: val()" failures on safari seem genuine to me. Someone needs to fix that.
[09:41:32] <DaveMethvin> i'd do it myself but don't have access to saf on windows
[09:41:44] <Krinkle> excuses :P
[09:41:54] <Krinkle> browserstack, saucelabs, crossbrowsertesting, ..
[09:41:56] <DaveMethvin> i guess i could use browserstack
[09:41:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:42:08] <DaveMethvin> i'll just use my mac vm .. oh wait
[09:42:44] <Krinkle> browserstack starts faster than my win vm, and its more reliable, no clean up and tunneling is easier :P
[09:42:56] <Krinkle> I don't know why I even still have the vm on my computer
[09:43:06] <DaveMethvin> although something is ugly about needing both Flash and Java
[09:43:26] <Krinkle> Afaik it doesn't need Flash, and Java only if you need the tunnel.
[09:43:34] <DaveMethvin> needs both on windows
[09:43:38] <Krinkle> ok
[09:43:46] <DaveMethvin> flash for remoting and java for the tunnel
[09:44:00] <Krinkle> are you using windows?
[09:44:06] <DaveMethvin> yep
[09:44:11] <Krinkle> Then install Safari?
[09:44:17] <Krinkle> (seems easier)
[09:44:35] <DaveMethvin> they aren't updating 5.x and never have supported 6.x
[09:44:38] <DaveMethvin> on windows
[09:44:43] <Krinkle> true
[09:44:51] <DaveMethvin> wish they were
[09:44:54] <DaveMethvin> i used to test locally
[09:45:16] <Krinkle> Oh, this is getting old
[09:45:17] <Krinkle> "Error: You have run out of API time"
[09:45:20] <Krinkle> The logs are full of it
[09:45:22] <Krinkle> nothing is happening
[09:45:37] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[09:45:49] <Krinkle> What happened to "Unlimited API time max. 10 concurrent workers"
[09:46:01] <Krinkle> If they document the max, we can account for it
[09:46:18] <DaveMethvin> "unlimited" must not mean what i think it means
[09:46:45] <DaveMethvin> maybe we overflowed a 32-bit number or something :D
[09:49:41] <Krinkle> Ah, they've changed the policy
[09:49:42] <Krinkle> http://www.browserstack.com/automated-browser-testing-api
[09:49:45] <Krinkle> bottom of the page
[09:50:00] <Krinkle> "10000 / month"
[09:50:16] <DaveMethvin> so we used that up already on april 4?
[09:50:23] <DaveMethvin> april 3
[09:50:25] <Krinkle> I doubtit
[09:50:58] <DaveMethvin> let me fix it ... redefine a month as 24 hours ... dunzo
[09:51:13] <Krinkle> But it also says "The automated testing API is free for use with open source projects."
[09:51:20] <Krinkle> Which is confusing, what does that mean
[09:51:34] <DaveMethvin> well clearly it must be important, it's italicized!
[09:51:35] <Krinkle> "Free Trial" is free, but not opensource only
[09:51:42] <Krinkle> its for anything
[09:51:46] <Krinkle> I don't see an open source plan
[09:51:52] <DaveMethvin> maybe their logic got hosed when they changed their policies
[09:52:00] <DaveMethvin> so who's our goto person for bstack?
[09:52:09] <Krinkle> me? :P
[09:52:18] <DaveMethvin> make it so! :D
[09:52:38] <Krinkle> They already emailed me I see
[09:52:40] <DaveMethvin> yeah that page doesn't make things clear does it
[09:52:53] <Krinkle> I'll cc you, jÃ¶rn and gnarf as usual.
[09:52:59] <DaveMethvin> k thanks

[14:03:48] <scott_gonzalez> "For example, we anticipate that weâ€™ll be able to remove 7 build systems and delete more than 7,000 filesâ€”comprising more than 4.5 million linesâ€”right off the bat. Over the long term a healthier codebase leads to more stability and fewer bugs."
[14:03:48] <scott_gonzalez> whoa
[14:03:50] <scott_gonzalez> http://blog.chromium.org/2013/04/blink-rendering-engine-for-chromium.html
[14:04:03] <mkwst> Right. I was just going to post that here. :)
[14:04:35] <mkwst> http://www.chromium.org/blink/developer-faq has some detail.
[14:12:30] <DaveMethvin> mkwst i trust  you guys to do good stuff!
[14:13:18] <scott_gonzalez> mkwst: So you're starting from WebKit (well, the existing fork that you already have), but will be diverging and not pushing changes upstream anymore, correct?
[14:14:08] <mkwst> scott_gonzalez: We're beginning from WebKit. All development will be in the open, starting today, when we remove about 5 million lines of code we don't compile or run.
[14:14:59] <scott_gonzalez> So this means that upstream WebKit won't be a blocker for anything anymore, right?
[14:15:15] <scott_gonzalez> I don't have a sense for how often that happens.
[14:15:26] <DaveMethvin> touch events perhaps? 
[14:19:03] <mkwst> http://www.chromium.org/blink#new-features has some detail about how we're planning on dealing with adding features to the platform.
[14:19:10] <mkwst> we're hopeful it'll be more transparent for everyone.
[14:22:10] <scott_gonzalez> So Opera will use Blink?
[14:23:25] <DaveMethvin> miketaylr retweeted the Blink announcement, i have a sneaky suspicion they were in on it
[14:24:02] <scott_gonzalez> "Implement the DOM in JS. This has the potential to make JavaScript DOM access dramatically faster"
[14:24:21] <scott_gonzalez> mkwst: Where does the speed increase come from? Not having to constantly cross the JS-C boundary?
[14:24:26] <DaveMethvin> just saw a tweet by bruce lawson, yes opera is in on it
[14:25:20] <mkwst> scott_gonzalez: dom in js is a huge experiment. we're hopeful that the speed will come from being able to jit everything (as v8 can't currently deal as intelligently with the C bits). we're also hopeful it'll kill memory leaks that come from not being clear on who's holding on to handles.
[14:25:26] <mkwst> we'll see how it goes.
[14:27:37] <scott_gonzalez> While you're redoing EVERYTHING, can you make moving iframes not cause a reload? ;-)
[14:30:38] <mkwst> scott_gonzalez: Doubt it. But please feel encouraged to file the bug. I'll poke our security folks, but I don't expect them to budge. It's apparently been a source of exploits in the past.
[14:30:44] <mkwst> crbug.com/new
[15:07:19] <scott_gonzalez> mkwst: There was a bug filed, I'm sure mikesherov can dig it up again.
[15:07:30] <mkwst> There's a bug on the WebKit tracker, yes.
[15:07:45] <mkwst> I don't remember if I filed that from a Chromium bug, or whether it was originally filed there.
