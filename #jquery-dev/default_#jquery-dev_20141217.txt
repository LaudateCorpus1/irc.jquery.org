[04:43:38] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin|away: You can make a task to update it for you. It'd be even simpler than UI's: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L338
[04:44:29] <scott_gonzalez> Core has no prior authors and no crazies that don't want their email address listed.
[04:44:43] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: this seems weird, what's the reason for this part? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/b6bec797d6a8ef0b377a866c38c67e66a626b45f/Gruntfile.js#L350-L358
[04:45:03] <scott_gonzalez> We have two authors who do not want their email address listed.
[04:45:40] <scott_gonzalez> Even though it's available in the git repo and the CLA signature sheet.
[04:45:56] <m_gol> even in the mailmap?
[04:46:09] <scott_gonzalez> Hah, the funny thing is one of them is in the mailmap.
[04:46:13] <m_gol> lol
[04:46:22] <scott_gonzalez> I guess dot files aren't as concerning?
[04:46:28] <scott_gonzalez> I tried reasoning with them.
[04:46:29] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: m_gol: slightly pimplier to look at version with out extra stuff https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L19
[04:46:33] <jzaefferer> m_gol: what is jQuery.acceptData? Is that supposed to be a public API?
[04:46:50] <arschmitz> simpler* 
[04:47:01] <jzaefferer> m_gol: there's no API docs... can you just drop the applet assertions?
[04:47:14] <m_gol> jzaefferer: this is internal but we want to ensure it works correctly
[04:47:26] <m_gol> it's supposed to return if a node can have data attached
[04:49:40] <m_gol> not sure why it's attached to the jQuery object btw, does any other project of ours use it?
[04:51:42] <m_gol> arschmitz scott_gonzalez: when pointing to a specific line, please press 'y' before copying the link; it'll change it to point to a specific commit
[04:51:49] <m_gol> otherwise after a while the link can be useless
[04:53:23] <jzaefferer> m_gol: I see no reason why anyone should use this directly, but thats besides the point. Dropping that test might also speed things up, since Java won't need to be loaded
[04:54:03] <DaveMethvin> ohai
[04:54:12] <m_gol> we still need to test it; if not via jQuery.acceptData directly then thorugh .data() anyway so this will cause problems
[04:54:41] <m_gol> it'd be nice if we could skip this test if Java is out of date, or fail just it, or sth
[04:54:50] <m_gol> but, unfortunately, the prompt is blocking
[04:54:50] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: I do that when pasting a URL that is meant to stay around.
[04:55:11] <m_gol> IRC is logged; everything stays around ;)
[04:55:14] <jzaefferer> m_gol: or just don't test it? Has this method caused any problems recently?
[04:55:36] <m_gol> I don't think so but that's mainly rwaldron's area
[04:55:57] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: hi; problems with the release?
[04:56:11] <DaveMethvin> well, kinda
[04:56:19] <DaveMethvin> just turned out to be a lot of little stuff I forgot
[04:56:21] <jzaefferer> well: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/data/accepts.js
[04:56:33] <DaveMethvin> and the authors files were all messed up
[04:56:38] <jzaefferer> No updates in a year and a very simple implementation
[04:56:41] <m_gol> jzaefferer: the compat version is more complicated: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/compat/src/data/accepts.js
[04:56:46] <DaveMethvin> and my vm kept doing strange things
[04:56:48] <m_gol> * a little more
[04:57:26] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: VMs not touched in a while tend to cause problems. ;) Especially Linux ones
[04:57:28] <DaveMethvin> if browserstack can't keep that stuff consistently working i would prefer to drop the test, at least for bs testing
[04:57:44] <jzaefferer> yeah, still not terrible. I'd still just drop the applet test and be done with it
[04:57:50] <DaveMethvin> so i think i have the authors stuff fixed
[04:58:00] <DaveMethvin> but it was pretty late so i decided not to try a release last night
[04:58:10] <m_gol> this test originated in compat, I believe; on master we don't have any logic for classid handling
[04:58:20] <m_gol> so it seems it's mostly for IE8 now
[04:58:31] <DaveMethvin> acceptsData? right
[04:58:41] <DaveMethvin> acceptData*
[04:59:50] <m_gol> of course this still means we'll have problems if Java in IE8 is out of date ;)
[05:00:01] <m_gol> and I don't envision us testing on IE8 locally too often
[05:00:13] <m_gol> so dropping for BrowserStack will effectively mean dropping entirely IMO
[05:00:15] <DaveMethvin> not if i can help it :)
[05:00:44] <jzaefferer> just drop the one assertion in both branches
[05:00:46] <DaveMethvin> having the swarm break every week or so is just too annoying
[05:00:57] <m_gol> still, being vulnerable to out-of-date Java in IE8 only is way better than in IE6-11 ;)
[05:01:10] <m_gol> but ok, this has caused so many problems that maybe it's better to drop it
[05:01:34] <m_gol> at least for BrowserStack, maybe one of us will run the test suite on IE8 manually at least once in a while
[05:02:12] <m_gol> this should be enough
[05:02:22] <jzaefferer> how would you drop for just TestSwarm?
[05:02:43] <DaveMethvin> just QUnit.skip() it if you're on TS
[05:02:55] <DaveMethvin> the URL has something in it
[05:03:00] <DaveMethvin> can't remember what now :)
[05:05:05] <jzaefferer> You don't need to skip the entire test
[05:05:25] <DaveMethvin> oh right, just the one
[05:05:39] <DaveMethvin> as long as it doesn't summon the Java
[05:05:43] <jzaefferer> oh well, I'd just delete the applet assertion, but you can also do a swarmUrl check around it

[06:21:50] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Everything is tagged as a beta.
[06:22:22] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise `npm install jquery@beta` would actually be older than `npm install jquery@latest`
[06:22:44] <DaveMethvin> does that make sense?

[06:41:02] <gibson042> that looks like it w.r.t. Sizzle, though
[06:42:38] <DaveMethvin> mainly just trying to clean up and file bugs against things
[06:42:50] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, didn't we fix this empty archive thing?
[06:49:03] <DaveMethvin> already, well it's fixable enough to do 1.11.2 now
[06:49:16] <DaveMethvin> i can manually create the zips
[06:50:06] <m_gol> 2.1.2 doesn't break my app so it's good ;)
[06:50:22] <DaveMethvin> need to work harder i guess
[06:50:24] <DaveMethvin> :)
[06:50:26] <m_gol> :)
[06:50:49] <m_gol> if not for 2.0.0-beta bugs I wouldn't be on the team so... ;)
[06:51:09] <DaveMethvin> there have been at least a few times where I'll say "Hey i need to test in IE8" and it fails horribly and then i realize i'm on master
[06:52:21] <m_gol> haha
[06:53:08] <m_gol> our test suite fails badly on Firefox on BrowserStack in live mode
[06:53:16] <m_gol> sth sketchy going on with included Firebug
[06:53:34] <DaveMethvin> i can't test on chrome locally without incognito
[06:53:38] <m_gol> so I'm glad I don't really have to test in older versions
[06:53:44] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: that, too
[06:53:45] <DaveMethvin> otherwise i get about a half dozen fails
[06:53:51] <m_gol> hmm, not that bad ;)
[06:54:03] <DaveMethvin> adblock, lastpass, maybe a few others
[06:54:14] <m_gol> ah, I have adblock disabled for localhost :)
[06:54:29] <DaveMethvin> skype keeps putting in some crap thing that wants to interpret numbers as phone numbers
[06:54:40] <DaveMethvin> THAT thing breaks every page it seems
[06:55:32] <m_gol> I've disabled this shit
[06:55:45] <m_gol> fortunately on OS X way less installers auto-install crap
[06:55:55] <m_gol> even Flash/Java behave kind-of sane
[06:56:14] <DaveMethvin> they're always trying to sneak in stuff
[06:59:27] <DaveMethvin> um
[06:59:39] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: any idea what this might be about?
[06:59:41] <DaveMethvin> https://gist.github.com/dmethvin/bcfc2460550ffbf6cb34
[07:01:20] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[07:01:35] <scott_gonzalez> Let me try installing the dependencies manually.
[07:01:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah doing the same here
[07:02:41] <DaveMethvin> commitplease requires sudo
[07:02:54] <DaveMethvin> i already had it installed locally
[07:03:19] <DaveMethvin> oh but that's windows
[07:03:33] <DaveMethvin> it worked fine for 2.1.2
[07:03:53] <DaveMethvin> let me try in my debian setup
[07:04:12] <scott_gonzalez> Why does commitplease require sudo?
[07:04:27] <DaveMethvin> links require admin privs in windows
[07:04:30] <DaveMethvin> DON'T ASK
[07:04:35] <scott_gonzalez> oy
[07:05:00] <scott_gonzalez> Try upgrading to commitplease 2.0.0?
[07:05:44] <DaveMethvin> these are different problems
[07:05:47] <scott_gonzalez> 1.8+ doesn't use symlinks.
[07:05:49] <DaveMethvin> forget the windows stuff
[07:06:03] <scott_gonzalez> This is the error I got:
[07:06:03] <scott_gonzalez> Error: EEXIST, file already exists '../../node_modules/commitplease/commit-msg-hook.js'
[07:06:32] <scott_gonzalez> But installing 2.0.0 works fine.
[07:06:44] <scott_gonzalez> The change from symlinks to file copying probably fixed a bug as well.
[07:08:07] <DaveMethvin> strange tho, i can manually run on this debian setup
[07:08:21] <DaveMethvin> and i actually did an npm install and built on this same setup yesterday for 1.11-stable
[07:09:47] <m_gol> if (release) {bugCount *= 100}
[07:09:58] <DaveMethvin> honestly
[07:10:07] <DaveMethvin> just rebuilding and testing before doing a push
[07:13:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'm consistently getting install errors with 1.7.0, but not with 2.0.0
[07:15:00] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: if you update commitplease on 1.11-stable, please do the same on 2.1-stable so that if we ever have to release another patch we don't have different deps
[07:15:22] <DaveMethvin> don't really understand why it broke here and not there
[07:15:29] <DaveMethvin> but still waiting on the build
[07:19:34] <DaveMethvin> whoa, now it's saying my 1.11 -stable is messed up
[07:19:55] <DaveMethvin> let me try this from my own box rather than the vm

[07:44:02] <m_gol> hm: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1788#issuecomment-67340458
[07:47:42] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: the issue is already in 2.1.1
[07:47:53] <m_gol> we just didn't fix it in 2.1.2
[07:47:57] <DaveMethvin> then why did he say it just broke?
[07:48:05] <m_gol> because it worked in 2.1.0 (I assume)
[07:48:08] <DaveMethvin> oh i misunderstod
[07:48:23] <DaveMethvin> i'm doing 3 things at once here
[07:48:32] <m_gol> we should never say we support a particular env if we have 0 tests running on it ;/
[07:48:55] <m_gol> not sure what to do about it
[07:49:03] <DaveMethvin> well in that case there is nothing we need to do until 3.0
[07:49:09] <DaveMethvin> it's assigned to a future milestone
[07:49:18] <m_gol> well, we kinda said we support node in 2.x
[07:49:22] <m_gol> and it worked in 2.1.0
[07:49:29] <m_gol> that's the main problem
[07:49:29] <DaveMethvin> and we do
[07:49:35] <DaveMethvin> but it's broken atm
[07:49:46] <DaveMethvin> we shouldn't be using bare location
[07:49:51] <m_gol> right
[07:49:51] <DaveMethvin> and instead window.location
[07:50:07] <m_gol> this would work with jsdom, though, right?
[07:50:17] <DaveMethvin> haha probably but i'm not sure
[07:50:17] <m_gol> since jsdom runs some magic C++ stuff that adds browser globals
[07:50:23] <m_gol> we also use document etc.
[07:50:28] <m_gol> so it's not just location
[07:50:42] <m_gol> the problem is that most others is contained in APIs that don't run at start
[07:50:46] <m_gol> and this assignment does
[07:52:48] <DaveMethvin> ugh, looks like it's still copying jquery-latest ... need to patch that too i guess
[07:53:41] <m_gol> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js is still at 1.11.1
[07:53:50] <m_gol> same with http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js
[07:54:05] <DaveMethvin> hasnt been pushed yet, it's still local and i'm looking
[07:54:09] <m_gol> ah
[07:54:20] <DaveMethvin> i think we said we were not going to update it anymore
[07:54:26] <m_gol> yes, we shouldn't
[07:54:34] <m_gol> esp. that the Google CDN coordinated it with us
[07:54:58] <m_gol> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.js is at 1.11.1
[07:55:06] <DaveMethvin> rigt
[07:55:38] <m_gol> from what I see, the only place where we wrote about Node support are blog posts, e.g.: http://blog.jquery.com/2014/01/24/jquery-1-11-and-2-1-released/
[07:55:49] <m_gol> and we don't say exactly what supporting node means there
[07:57:21] <timmywil> we say it in the readme
[07:57:59] <m_gol> timmywil: we still don't say there what supporting Node means, thought, right?
[07:58:16] <timmywil> This kind of error could be covered with linting
[07:58:33] <timmywil> No, we just recommend the "jquery" package for Node
[07:58:49] <timmywil> browser: false
[07:58:53] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: good point
[07:59:04] <DaveMethvin> but i still think we should run a smoke test in node
[07:59:05] <m_gol> btw, from my branch making promises-aplus-tests work
[07:59:06] <m_gol> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/e1303a38197b36297ce6190ad318fc9e73876298
[07:59:20] <m_gol> this location.href -> window.location.href change was required even for jsdom
[07:59:29] <DaveMethvin> alright it looks like the -latest files didn't update which is GOOD
[07:59:49] <m_gol> :)
[08:00:10] <DaveMethvin> before i continue i need to do a reminder ticket
[08:02:31] <m_gol> so, judging by my commit, this one change is enough to please jsdom in Node
[08:02:42] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15dmethvin opened issue #1942: [1.11-stable] Take out the copy to jquery-latest 02http://git.io/puO1nw
[08:02:43] <m_gol> but I guess it's too late for that now
[08:02:58] <m_gol> unless we want to release 2.1.3 now and not advertise 2.1.2 at all
[08:03:22] <DaveMethvin> i'd prefer not, given the effort it takes
[08:03:33] <DaveMethvin> and confusion
[08:03:48] <DaveMethvin> if they need a version they can make a small edit to get one
[08:03:55] <m_gol> with Promises/A+ tests running in Node (I want to add browser testing but the Node part can stay) we'll have basic Node testing covered
[08:03:55] <DaveMethvin> and we'll have 3.0 out in not that far off
[08:03:57] <m_gol> in 3.0
[08:04:04] <DaveMethvin> that would be nice
[08:04:22] <m_gol> that's already done, it'll land when the patch making Deferred compatible lands :)
[08:05:45] <DaveMethvin> oh the tag 1.x stuff shoudl come out as well m_gol ?
[08:05:58] <DaveMethvin> it's still in there and just got tagged
[08:06:06] <m_gol> npm info jquery dist-tags
[08:06:06] <m_gol> { beta: '2.1.2', latest: '2.1.2', '1.x': '1.11.2', old: '1.9.1' }
[08:06:08] <m_gol> looks good
[08:06:22] <DaveMethvin>   npm publish --tag 1.x
[08:06:35] <DaveMethvin> i thought we weren't wanting to do that?
[08:06:49] <m_gol> right

[08:06:57] <m_gol> there's no way to unpublish the tag currently
[08:07:03] <m_gol> and it's better if it points to 1.11.2 than 1.11.1
[08:07:13] <m_gol> and with compat being a separate package the problem will solve itself

[11:53:12] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: Aye. Not so good.
[11:53:27] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: Busiest time of year over here.
[11:53:33] <JamesMGreene> yeah
[11:53:42] <JamesMGreene> Busiest for work for me is fall, so that's not so bad now
[11:53:56] <JamesMGreene> Just personal constantly since November :(
[11:56:25] <JamesMGreene> My grandma died, I was sick (cold, sinus infection, bronchitis, sinus infection again, bronchitis reinvigorated) for about 5 weeks (still coughing a little), my daughter (2.75-yo) got a hairline fracture on her tibia, some tried to break into our house through the garage (resulting in an incoming repair of over $1000 to a brand new door as of August, plus spending another $500 to improve our security setup)
[11:56:30] <JamesMGreene> The hits just keep on coming :-\
[11:56:49] <JamesMGreene> Oh, and of course my wife and daughter were both sick (yay for toddlers)
[11:57:53] <JamesMGreene> Just a big ole FML kinda 2 months
[12:31:52] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: still working on a blog post?
[12:42:05] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: btw, I was wrong, this location stuff worked in 2.1.1 which means we broke it in 2.1.2

[13:29:34] <DaveMethvin> so m_gol markelog timmywil what do you think about this node problem?
[13:30:07] <timmywil> it does unfortunately break it
[13:30:17] <DaveMethvin> if we do another release it will need to be on both branches
[13:30:44] <timmywil> Yea, but the patch isn't needed for 1.x
[13:30:59] <DaveMethvin> well the versions will be wonky then
[13:31:06] <DaveMethvin> or do we not care anymore? :)
[13:31:24] <timmywil> I mean, I guess we could just commit a version bump in 1.x
[13:31:27] <timmywil> heh
[13:31:50] <DaveMethvin> if only it were so easy ... it will take an hour with the build script
[13:32:05] <timmywil> well, I'm not opposed to specifying window.location in 1.x, but it just doesn't make a difference for our supported environments
[13:32:23] <DaveMethvin> i should hack into the CDN, edit the damned file, 5 mintes, done
[13:32:43] * timmywil doesn't look
[13:33:01] <DaveMethvin> Sooooo frustrating
[13:33:09] <DaveMethvin> i haven't sent the cdn files yet
[13:33:15] <timmywil> we should probably have a sanity check for this
[13:33:16] <DaveMethvin> so that is another dilemma
[13:33:29] <timmywil> could even be in the release script
[13:33:30] <DaveMethvin> i have to do that manually, they have to post them manually
[13:34:05] <timmywil> when do we plan on releasing 3.0?
[13:34:11] <DaveMethvin> next month
[13:34:28] <DaveMethvin> we've done a lot of the work and it's in master
[13:34:29] <timmywil> can we move that up?
[13:34:40] <DaveMethvin> well, if we get the work done :)
[13:34:53] <DaveMethvin> what you doing during the holidays?
[13:35:06] <timmywil> I'm actually working
[13:35:12] <timmywil> I took all my time off in Italy
[13:35:13] <DaveMethvin> FOR US?
[13:35:16] <DaveMethvin> damn
[13:35:29] <DaveMethvin> you need to align your priorities! :)
[13:35:35] <timmywil> heh
[13:35:57] <DaveMethvin> honestly it's SUCH a big pain in the ass to do a new release
[13:36:11] <DaveMethvin> the 1.11.2 one didn't even finish properly and i couldn't see why
[13:36:12] <timmywil> it would also be nice to know how many users this actually affects
[13:36:16] <DaveMethvin> right
[13:36:56] <timmywil> we could do an npm only release for 2.x 2.1.2+1
[13:37:10] <timmywil> if you're using it in node, you're most likely getting it from npm
[13:37:39] <DaveMethvin> i dunno
[13:37:47] <DaveMethvin> that seems even crazier
[13:37:55] <timmywil> didn't we do that once?
[13:37:57] <DaveMethvin> we're distributing so many ways
[13:38:04] <DaveMethvin> it's nice for the bits to be the same
[13:38:14] <timmywil> yea
[13:38:53] <DaveMethvin> tbh i can't be totally sure i can redo this without something going wrong
[13:39:02] <DaveMethvin> and i absolutely cannot do it tomorrow
[13:39:34] <DaveMethvin> so if we're going to fix it i'd prefer to wait until Friday, just release 1.11.3 and 2.1.3
[13:39:54] <DaveMethvin> which means this has to be fixed of course
[13:40:01] <timmywil> I guess we should
[13:40:04] <DaveMethvin> it's just one line
[13:40:15] <DaveMethvin> and a shitload of jquery-release code to run
[13:40:19] <DaveMethvin> TWICE
[13:40:25] <timmywil> lol
[13:40:27] <timmywil> <3
[13:40:42] <DaveMethvin> and we still need to decide whether to send the current new version to the CDNs

[13:50:53] <m_gol> so, I have a PR so that this doesn't happen in the future
[13:51:00] <m_gol> unfortunately I didn't submit it yesterday
[13:51:03] <timmywil> nice work
[13:51:23] <timmywil> I wonder how hard it would be to put it on the -stable branches
[13:55:02] <m_gol> the Grunt stuff should be easy to move
[13:55:17] <m_gol> probably some time required to add variables everywhere
[13:55:29] <m_gol> but this is not a huge amount of work
[13:55:39] <m_gol> idk how many Node users we have
[13:55:42] <m_gol> but they tend to be loud
[13:55:51] <m_gol> this looks a little bad :/
[13:59:07] <DaveMethvin> we really need to make this release stuff flow more smoothly
[13:59:25] <DaveMethvin> i am inclined to hold off on sending these to the CDNs and just send them the next ones
[14:00:07] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: can you put in the fix for node? for this release we can just fix it with no units since we have 3.0 coming
[14:00:13] <DaveMethvin> i'm in a meeting
[14:01:33] <m_gol> ok
[14:01:45] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: will do
[14:02:48] <denis-sokolov> I'm not "loud". :)
[14:03:02] <DaveMethvin> WHAT? :)
[14:03:20] <DaveMethvin> he meant the other node user :)
[14:03:28] <denis-sokolov> :D
[14:04:23] <denis-sokolov> Seriously, though, if one chooses CommonJS and Browserify (and it's been a very growing trend),
[14:04:33] <denis-sokolov> it's really nice to be running tests on Node.
[14:04:51] <DaveMethvin> you should write a post
[14:05:12] <denis-sokolov> On what?
[14:05:33] <DaveMethvin> on how you test
[14:07:28] <denis-sokolov> Hm. Maybe. But I feel humble to share opinions publicly.
[14:07:45] <denis-sokolov> Besides, there is nothing special about DOM, you just test it like any other Node module.
[14:07:57] <denis-sokolov> require, assert, done.

[14:09:00] <DaveMethvin> thanks m_gol 
[14:10:16] <m_gol> the PR fixing it properly on master is obviously way longer than 1 line ;)
[14:10:41] <denis-sokolov> So, global variables are bad. Don't use global variables! :)
[14:11:11] <m_gol> denis-sokolov: welcome to the browser world! :)
[14:11:40] <denis-sokolov> But there's a holy savior workaround - Browserify! (or webpack or whatever)
[14:12:15] <denis-sokolov> One should strive to avoid bad stuff. Don't use document.write, don't use <blink>, don't use global variables. Easy.
[14:24:08] <m_gol> denis-sokolov: Browserify has its own share of issues, amongst others because of required bundling
[14:24:28] <m_gol> denis-sokolov: but that can be a long discussion. :) let's not dive in too much ;)
[14:25:01] <denis-sokolov> Okay.
[14:25:22] <denis-sokolov> Just saying, avoid global variables, regardless of Browserify or no Browserify.
[14:26:17] <m_gol> whether you say DOMParser or window.DOMParser, it's still a global
[14:26:27] <m_gol> same with location etc.
[14:27:03] <m_gol> you can wrap it but the fact remains - there are a lot of globals in the browser world and there is no way (that doesn't require preprocessing) to get to them in any other way
[14:27:38] <m_gol> I'd be happy to avoid using them and just get them from some standard ES6 modules but that won't happen soon
[14:28:47] <denis-sokolov> If you access them through window, they're not globals.
[14:29:17] <denis-sokolov> If you always specify a window, then make that window your parameter, suddenly the entirety of your code acts on a particular window given to your function.
[14:29:26] <denis-sokolov> And I can call your function with two separate windows.
[14:30:00] <denis-sokolov> They are not globals, they are literally properties of a particular window. :)
[14:30:19] <denis-sokolov> And I mean that in a real life sense, not in a js syntax sense.
[14:30:58] <denis-sokolov> For the case of the offending location global. You don't want _any_ location, you want the location of a particular document in a particular window.
[14:31:08] <denis-sokolov> That is, window.document.location.
[14:38:17] <m_gol> denis-sokolov: yeah, I see your point
[14:38:34] <m_gol> denis-sokolov: but there are unavoidable globals, e.g. setTimeout
[14:38:50] <m_gol> because in browsers we want to get window.setTimeout and in Node global.setTimeout
[14:39:04] <m_gol> which are different functions with different implementations but look kinda the same
[14:40:03] <denis-sokolov> It's a good point. I treat setTimeout function essentially part of ECMAScript.
[14:40:04] <m_gol> ha, jsdom has its own setTimeout, interesting
[14:40:17] <denis-sokolov> I know it isn't, but the talks about that were forever.
[14:40:40] <denis-sokolov> In that sense it isn't global just as require or Array isn't global. Those are built-ins.
[14:40:59] <denis-sokolov> jsdom has its own setTimeout? Whoa.
[14:41:11] <m_gol> and it's different
[14:41:45] <denis-sokolov> Tell me more!
[14:42:24] <m_gol> idk a lot, I just toStringed global.setTimeout and jsdom's window.setTimeout and I see different things so perhaps it's not just an alias
[14:43:14] <denis-sokolov> I can't see it in the repo though: https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/search?p=1&q=setTimeout&utf8=%E2%9C%93
[14:43:52] <m_gol> https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/blob/4899ed5ff15acdd45fba499726335c5ff3a10009/lib/jsdom/browser/index.js#L121
[14:44:22] <denis-sokolov> Indeed.
[14:44:24] <denis-sokolov> Interesting.
[14:45:36] <m_gol> it uses Node's setTimeout under the hood but also caches some things: https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/blob/4899ed5ff15acdd45fba499726335c5ff3a10009/lib/jsdom/browser/index.js#L71-L75
[14:46:07] <denis-sokolov> Apparently it to prevent window.clearTimeout clearing global timeouts, and to automatically clear window timeouts on window.close.
[14:46:28] <denis-sokolov> But yeah, it's just a wrapper.
[14:47:18] <m_gol> from what I see it's done so that window.close() discards all timeouts
[14:48:40] <m_gol> if we don't use it we're leaking timeouts
[14:49:03] <m_gol> not sure how many people care about jsdom's window.close() playing nice with jQuery... it seems a niche of a niche
[14:50:43] <denis-sokolov> It is, I don't think it's a particularly useful goal.
[14:52:01] <denis-sokolov> During some of my project tests, I create around 150 jsdom instances, and I don't close none of them.
[14:52:16] <denis-sokolov> I don't experience a tinyest problem with performance.
