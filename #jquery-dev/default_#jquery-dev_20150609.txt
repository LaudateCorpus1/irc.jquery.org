[06:00:57] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I know nothing about browserify or debowerify.
[06:01:27] <scott_gonzalez> It sounds like you just need to add `main` to the manifest?

[11:47:45] <Mr21_> Hi :) did you have already discussed about prevent severals inclusion of jquery.js like a simple if(!jQuery) or something?
[11:59:01] <m_gol> Mr21_: loading multiple jQueries on one site is supported
[12:04:46] <Mr21_> m_gol: yep, but if always the last jquery included which will be taken, right?
[12:05:12] <m_gol> Mr21_: you can e.g. use noConflict
[12:21:37] <Mr21_> m_gol: thanks, I have read the doc
[12:26:21] <m_gol> Mr21_: or you can load one jQuery, add some code using it, load another jQuery, add some code using it. You'll end up with two jQueries, both being used.
[12:29:41] <m_gol> Mr21_: yes, I've seen a site doing that :P
[12:30:26] <Mr21_> m_gol: I see, it's at work, I have to patch some really messy codes... and sometime I asked myself if upgrading the version 1.6.2 will help me (obviously) but many part of the site are included with jquery.js (in php.. you see what i mean...)
[12:31:12] <m_gol> Mr21_: jQuery Migrate for the rescue! ;)
[12:32:54] <Mr21_> m_gol: and I imagine a secret window.jqueryKeepTheLastest to set to avoid the creation of the other one.. I will read how works jquery.migrate thanks :)
