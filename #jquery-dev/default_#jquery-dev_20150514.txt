[03:56:29] <m_gol> timmywil DaveMethvin|away jzaefferer scott_gonzalez: I modified the Jenkins commands for Core/Core Compat jobs so that jquery-git1 & jquery-git2 files are not updated anymore. Please switch to jquery-git & jquery-compat-git, we'll most likely soon remove jquery-git1 & jquery-git2 files & set up 301 redirects on them to jquery-compat-git & jquery-git respectively as jzaefferer suggested
[04:00:37] <m_gol> markelog_: do you want to look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2183? You had remarks before; I'd like to land it today

[04:03:03] <m_gol> ah, the build is broken. :/ I'd better wait with landing anything then
[04:06:01] <m_gol> build is broken due to recent infra changes
[04:08:40] <markelog__> m_gol: ok-ok, waiting
[04:09:04] <m_gol> I wrote more details on #jquery-infrastructure

[04:43:43] <m_gol> markelog__: you can still look at the PR, even if I prefer to fix infra before landing it :)
[04:46:20] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: Thanks. I just pushed an update: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/e1751383f17118d250a8ef576f3663de6ea76f36 and I updated the associated Jenkins job.
[12:29:54] <someguy> I'd like to author a regex attribute selector for sizzle but since I can see from google this is something others have wanted, just want to feel out the chances of it being accepted
[12:31:02] <someguy> (assume for sake of this question that it's wonderful in every way)
[12:35:44] <someguy> my proposed syntax would be like the contains word selector, but with a regex, e.g. $('img[src~=/thumbnail\\d{4}\\.jpg$/]')
[12:36:48] <DaveMethvin> hey someguy, no we are not adding more selectors to Sizzle now. However you can create your own plugin and use it with Sizzle.
[12:37:10] <DaveMethvin> remember that a selector like that could be really expensive
[12:37:59] <someguy> oh I know it would be, but that would be up to the person using it to use intelligently
[12:38:13] <DaveMethvin> that's fine, you can create the plugin and use it wisely
[12:38:14] <someguy> but if you're not accepting more selectors, you're not accepting more selectors!

[12:50:12] <someguy> ok in that case may I sort this out: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/333
[12:54:15] <someguy> presumably by implementing gibson's suggestion and making pull request
