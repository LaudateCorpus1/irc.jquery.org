[07:11:19] <Gho5t> quick question on Git if anyone has a second
[07:11:27] <Gho5t> I checked out my forked repo
[07:11:31] <Gho5t> created a branch
[07:11:51] <Gho5t> and then did a checkout on the branch
[07:12:04] <Gho5t> but I don't see any updates to my repo online
[07:12:07] <Gho5t> or in my local folder
[07:12:15] <Gho5t> should it be creating a folder for my branch?
[07:19:12] <shoky> Gho5t: you need to 'push' your new branch to your fork in order to see it online
[07:19:43] <Gho5t> ah
[07:24:33] <Gho5t> is this the syntax: git branch --set-upstream htts://github.com/gho5t/myrepo/mybranch ?
[07:25:01] <DaveMethvin> git push origin branchname
[07:26:36] <DaveMethvin> Gho5t read http://contribute.jquery.org/commits-and-pull-requests/ and if you think it needs more detail, open an issue at https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/issues
[07:26:42] <Gho5t> ok thanks
