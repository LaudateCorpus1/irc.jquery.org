[03:51:58] <crome> greets
[03:54:49] <crome> am I doing something stupid when I write this test http://pastebin.com/2xqbmvWh and expect it not to run indefinitely because of an Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'bar' of undefined which causes start() to never execute?
[03:55:05] <crome> seemed like I couldnt find guys on the general channels
[04:42:00] <jzaefferer> crome: that's a bad test, you should just fix the test. There's probably a workaround, but not really worth the trouble
[05:35:53] <crome> johnwards: what would be the recommended way?
[05:36:19] <crome> I could put tons of boilerplate branches not to make calls that are bound to cause an error but I dont think thats smart
[05:36:30] <johnwards> chrome: thing you meant member:jzaefferer :)
[05:36:36] <crome> ooo
[05:36:37] <crome> correct!
[05:37:18] <jzaefferer> crome: use deepEquals to compare the object?
[05:37:45] <jzaefferer> deepEquals(obj, { foo: { bar: "whatever" } })
[05:39:44] <crome> yeah, but in my specific case I dont have a "whatever", I can just check if a property is defined
