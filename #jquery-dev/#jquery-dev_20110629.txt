[03:26:05] <addyosmani> dmethvin, kswedberg would like to discuss another docs item when you have a chance.
[03:26:08] <addyosmani> :)
[05:27:58] <NoNoNo> When will 1.6.2 be ready for release?
[07:36:50] <rwaldron> timmywil hey dude
[07:37:00] <timmywil> rwaldron: hey
[07:37:15] <rwaldron> so, i'm not opposed you your re-open of 9691
[07:37:20] <rwaldron> I've been working on a related ticket, should I take this one in addition?
[07:37:32] <rwaldron> at least for investigation
[07:38:15] <timmywil> rwaldron: sure!  :D
[07:43:57] <rwaldron> ok rad
[07:44:03] <rwaldron> thanks for the second opinion on that
[07:44:07] <rwaldron> i was sort of annoyed
[07:44:28] <rwaldron> because it reads like "i want the exact opposite of what someone else wanted"
[07:47:18] <timmywil> yea totally
[07:48:48] <rwaldron> timmywil also, i spent last night and this morning doing a complete code style sweep of jquery mobile
[07:49:03] <timmywil> rwaldron: ooo nice
[07:49:11] <rwaldron> and while i was doing that, i was checking our code for comparison (like, what to do in this situation)
[07:49:20] <rwaldron> and i discovered a bunch of places we can clean up
[07:49:39] <rwaldron> do you think i should file it?
[07:49:48] <rwaldron> or just do it and give it to you to review
[07:50:19] <timmywil> i'd say file, could always use more eyes
[07:51:31] <rwaldron> word.
[07:51:45] <rwaldron> I'll copy the above text into the ticket
[08:18:04] <rwaldron> timmywil do you think 9699 has anything to do with "style" being both an attribute and a property?
[08:18:50] <timmywil> rwaldron: setting the property takes care of it.  Looks like a webkit bug tho because removeAttribute does not remove the attribute.
[08:19:06] <timmywil> rwaldron: although it does _sometimes_
[08:19:26] <rwaldron> you're a damn maven with these attributes
[08:19:57] <timmywil> rwaldron: thanks!
[09:10:30] <[gr]ouzo13> Is this the correct place to ask a question about cookies? Seems i cant get them working here http://jsfiddle.net/bkEEb/5/
[09:12:07] <kborchers> [gr]ouzo13: all support is in #jquery
[09:12:19] <[gr]ouzo13> Ok,apologies!
[09:12:29] <kborchers> np
[09:44:18] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: I hadn't realized that comments were capitalized, maybe we should add a note about that in the style guide
[09:47:50] <timmywil> rwaldron: there might be some overlap in the style edits for effects on the 1.7/enhancement_8685 branch
[09:47:53] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez yeah the published style guide needs to be updated
[09:48:25] <rwaldron> timmywil bummer, that was the one that needed the most help
[09:48:33] <rwaldron> dont sweat it i guess
[09:48:34] <timmywil> rwaldron: yea :P
[09:49:43] <timmywil> rwaldron: well, we can handle the conflicts if we run into them.  a lot of it just looked familiar
[09:50:48] <timmywil> rwaldron: thanks for doing all that
[09:51:44] <rwaldron> i'm annoyed with myself
[09:51:57] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez pointed out something that I literally remembered backwards
[09:52:05] <rwaldron> http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines#Assignment
[09:52:09] <timmywil> oh, yea, I had too
[09:52:18] <rwaldron> non-assignments on top, not bottom
[09:52:20] <rwaldron> efff
[09:52:28] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:52:58] <timmywil> scott is right too much
[09:53:01] <rwaldron> for some reason, i was thinking of how jaubourg does it in ajax
[09:53:12] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez is right in the ways i need him to be
[09:53:43] <gnarf> rwaldron: i fuck that one up all the time unassigned on bottom
[09:56:34] <timmywil> ?source
[09:56:35] <bot-t> jQuery 1.5 - http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5/jquery.js
[09:57:13] <timmywil> bot-t: source is jQuery 1.6.1 - http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.js
[09:57:14] <bot-t> timmywil, No results found for "is jQuery 1.6.1 - http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.js".
[11:18:18] <rwaldron> timmywil yt?
[11:18:25] <timmywil> rwaldron: hey
[11:18:34] <rwaldron> hey dude
[11:18:38] <rwaldron> so, i was thinking
[11:18:48] <rwaldron> we may want to create a compat plugin
[11:18:51] <rwaldron> like jquery used to
[11:18:56] <rwaldron> for attr stuff
[11:19:08] <rwaldron> to help ease people to new releases
[11:19:21] <rwaldron> i feel like we may have cut off an arm or a leg
[11:19:37] <timmywil> 1.6.1 fixed most of it
[11:19:41] <rwaldron> because even UI is having problems
[11:19:57] <timmywil> orly?
[11:20:03] <rwaldron> its not an issue of something being "fixed"
[11:20:16] <timmywil> i meant fixed back-compat
[11:20:44] <timmywil> the main thing that is still different is element properties like selectedIndex
[11:20:55] <rwaldron> ok, i feel like we're still getting a lot of forum posts and bugs about attr
[11:21:07] <rwaldron> i'm def not trying to be negative with you
[11:21:39] <rwaldron> i'm trying to think of how we can help 19 million sites smoothly upgrade
[11:22:05] <timmywil> i really think we've already taken care of most of it
[11:22:34] <timmywil> was there an issue you had in mind?
[11:23:15] <rwaldron> not in particular
[11:23:21] <rwaldron> if you think so, then I will trust you
[11:25:02] <timmywil> rwaldron: in terms of bugs open, the attributes module is the lowest right now.  The only issues people should be having with back-compat right now are probably the selectedIndex thing and html5 boolean attributes in IE9.
[11:26:02] <timmywil> and removeAttr('style') in webkit actually...I'm not sure what to do about that one
[11:26:02] <rwaldron> cool
[11:26:09] <rwaldron> maybe nothing
[11:26:21] <rwaldron> like i said, if you're saying it, i trust you
[11:26:37] <rwaldron> i dont need stats or numbers ;)
[11:27:14] <timmywil> rwaldron: I think we can take care of the IE9 thing by removing attr support for html5 booleans and let the user handle those.
[11:27:58] <timmywil> as far as selectedIndex, that really should be prop now, but I understand people getting frustrated that attr won't work for that anymore
[11:28:35] <timmywil> rwaldron: but I would like to know what issues UI is having
[11:28:49] <rwaldron> problems with aria attributes
[11:28:59] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez can fill you in
[11:30:50] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: I've got some stuff to talk to you about, just haven't had time
[11:31:16] <scott_gonzalez> we're having issues with ARIA attributes in IE 6 (the only browser I've gotten around to testing aside from Chrome)
[11:31:55] <scott_gonzalez> it's possible that I just don't know what I'm doing :-P
[11:32:15] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: I'd be glad to help
[11:32:34] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: is there a test suite I can investigate?
[11:33:05] <scott_gonzalez> if you checkout https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/core-1.6.1
[11:33:27] <scott_gonzalez> you have to drop 1.6.1 into the repo (I just replace the contents of the jquery-1.5.1.js file)
[11:33:39] <scott_gonzalez> I think there are failing tests in the button suite
[11:34:16] <scott_gonzalez> it's been a few weeks since I looked at this
[11:35:24] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: ok, I'll take a look
[11:37:26] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: I believe aria values even for attributes like aria-disabled are strings, so "true" and "false" instead of true and false, but I could be wrong about that
[11:44:27] <scott_gonzalez> we had a mix, sometimes we used booleans, sometimes we used strings
[11:44:52] <scott_gonzalez> so like I said, we could just be doing things wrong
[11:45:16] <scott_gonzalez> though Colin Clark seemed to agree that we should be setting booleans
[11:45:33] <scott_gonzalez> should we be using attr or prop for aria?
[11:47:23] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: it depends on the spec'd type for the property.  If they're booleans, I'd recommend prop, if strings, attr always sets strings so it could be safer.  Although, you could do .prop('aria-disabled', 'true')
[11:47:35] <timmywil> but I'll dive in this week and tinker with it
[11:47:52] <scott_gonzalez> cool, thanks
[11:49:06] <timmywil> np
[13:08:54] <ryanneufeld> any of the jquery mobile guys hanging out in here?
[13:09:21] <ryanneufeld> I'm trying to integrate jqmobile with phonegap
[13:33:53] <DaveMethvin> ryanneufeld: #jquerymobile
[13:34:03] <ryanneufeld> cheers
[17:50:34] <Corey> danheberden: If the cron run at midnight blows the physical box up I'm going to laugh.
[19:46:09] <gseguin> Hi all, I'm looking at the ajax code: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L730
[19:46:30] <gseguin> and I'm wondering if that's a typo and should be state < 2
[19:46:47] <gseguin> or if I simply don't understand what it's trying to do
