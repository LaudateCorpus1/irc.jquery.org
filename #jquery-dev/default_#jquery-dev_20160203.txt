[09:27:20] <m_gol> gibson042: are you there?
[09:27:37] <gibson042> yes
[09:27:44] <m_gol> https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/pull/1818
[09:27:59] <m_gol> I wanted to update Karma in Sizzle to 0.13 a while ago but it was broken in IE<9
[09:28:11] <m_gol> they may fix it for IE 7-8 but it seems IE 6 might be problematic
[09:29:21] <m_gol> that's one of the problems with supporting very obsolete environments; our setup might be causing problems because of bugs fixed in newer releases of our tools but we can't upgrade them because of them dropping support for those obsolete environments...
[09:30:35] <m_gol> I've been mailing with BrowserStack about various issues related to Android testing but they always ask about using up-to-date Karma with its dependencies so I'm kind of dead-locked here
[09:30:38] <gibson042> does that fix https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/issues/1696 ? I traced it all the way down a while back
[09:32:11] <m_gol> latest Karma uses latest socket.io so if it was fixed in socket.io latest Karma should be fine
[09:33:19] <m_gol> OTH, Karma 0.12.x relies on socket.io 0.x so nothing like that will ever get fixed there
[09:34:08] <gibson042> ok, socketio-parser has been good since 2.2.5: https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-parser/commit/6387bb003c0faeb900a2d61121a0cfeedd101a3a
[09:34:32] <gibson042> socketio-client has been good since 1.4.0: https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client/commit/af13a5f2cd688ef6227772f4a30aeda30516fd89
[09:37:12] <gibson042> socket.io has been good since 1.4.0: https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/ddb3445f3d9009554577bbd05b033031e20e23d8
[09:38:21] <gibson042> karma-runner has been good since v0.13.19: https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/commit/67828aa45e4686698e4b0f4a3f0771f3e3933e25
[09:39:44] <gibson042> soooo https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/pull/1818 should let Sizzle upgrade karma
[09:39:51] <gibson042> https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/362
[09:42:03] <gibson042> and drop support with Sizzle 3
[09:47:05] <m_gol> this PR is still broken on IE 6
[09:47:11] <m_gol> only works in IE7+
[09:47:41] <m_gol> gibson042: I'm just thinking what to reply to https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/pull/1818#issuecomment-179240032
[09:48:27] <gibson042> I suppose "yes"
[09:53:25] <m_gol> gibson042: so we'd drop support for IE 6 in Sizzle 3 & then upgrade Karma? Do I understand correctly?
[09:55:18] <gibson042> yes, at the most conservative
[09:56:34] <m_gol> k, thx
[09:58:35] <m_gol> gibson042: do you know what are QUnit plans regarding to browser support? Will 2.0 support IE 9+ or older ones as well?
[09:59:18] <gibson042> I don't remember offhand, but no code has been added that would reduce browser support
