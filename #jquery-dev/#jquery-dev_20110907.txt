[07:12:24] <scott_gonzalez> miketaylr: do you think anyone who knows a lot about Opera internals would be willing to look into a jQuery UI bug?
[07:12:35] <miketaylr> scott_gonzalez: yep
[07:12:56] <miketaylr> scott_gonzalez: can you file an opera bug, link to the jqui bug and tell me the bug #?
[07:12:59] <miketaylr> bugs.opera.com
[07:13:31] <scott_gonzalez> sure, I didn't really want to file a bug because the test case is about as far from a reduced test case as you can get
[07:14:13] <scott_gonzalez> let me show you the bug first
[07:14:13] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7577
[07:14:43] <scott_gonzalez> deleting this line makes the bug go away: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.dialog.js#L326
[07:15:18] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea how a property on the widget instance (which is stored using .data()) would have any effect on the DOM
[07:26:58] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 3 new commits to master: http://git.io/NXxftg
[07:26:58] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Merge branch 'master' of github.com:dmethvin/jquery - Dave Methvin
[07:26:58] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Reverts broken support string. Fixes #10197 - rwldrn
[07:26:58] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Bug in rmultidash. Fixes #10194 - rwldrn
[08:44:35] <danheberden> DaveMethvin - one more thing to add to your list of release todo's is to ping Doug to update the home page
[08:45:22] <DaveMethvin> danheberden:  thanks! the list is surprisingly long, with all the cdns and such
[08:45:33] <danheberden> hehe - is it an actual list?
[08:45:46] <danheberden> like, do we have release instructions somewherE?
[08:46:19] <DaveMethvin> i'm making it now
[08:53:20] <jaubourg> oh hi guys
[08:53:47] <jaubourg> so, I heard Dave is making a release... again? jQuery weekly ;)
[08:53:49] * jaubourg hides
[08:54:32] <danheberden> jquery.90210.min.js
[08:54:47] <DaveMethvin> pretty soon even our mins will be maxed
[08:54:56] <jaubourg> davery.90210.min.js rather ;)
[08:55:12] <DaveMethvin> you never forget your first release
[08:55:23] <danheberden> well Math.min() IS infinity
[08:55:23] <jaubourg> hehe
[08:55:33] <DaveMethvin> it's usually awkward and not what you expected
[08:55:38] <DaveMethvin> we're talking about jquery right?
[08:55:57] * jaubourg is talking non-sense as usual
[08:56:04] <danheberden> lol DaveMethvin
[08:56:20] <danheberden> i just hope that it doesn't compile
[08:56:33] <DaveMethvin> well the good news is that i think i have the patches for 1.6.4 done
[08:56:38] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron did two
[08:56:46] <DaveMethvin> and i have the other as a pr that i'll land this afternoon
[08:56:58] <jaubourg> Dave: make a RC so that I can sneak a change between RC and release... please
[08:57:05] <DaveMethvin> GAAAAAH!
[08:57:15] <jaubourg> :)
[08:57:15] * DaveMethvin runs after jaubourg with rolling pin
[08:57:40] <jaubourg> \o\  /o/ <run for your life!>
[08:57:53] <DaveMethvin> kind of surprising so few ppl have complained about the xhtml one
[08:58:06] <DaveMethvin> but i really dislike xhtml anyway
[08:58:17] <paul_irish> luckily they realize xhtml is a useless pursuit
[08:58:42] <jaubourg> 1) probably few serve xhtml with the proper mimetype 2) people nearly never jump onto a new release the first week
[08:58:51] <paul_irish> i think its silly for jquery to support anyway
[08:59:03] <jaubourg> why?
[08:59:04] <DaveMethvin> i like the cut of  your jib paul_irish
[08:59:20] <jaubourg> it's not like it's insanely difficult to support
[08:59:56] <DaveMethvin> i think the hard part is that many ppl want to say they're using xhtml but break the rules like they're using html
[09:00:04] <DaveMethvin> and then bitch when they can't
[09:00:14] <DaveMethvin> there have been a few tix like that
[09:00:29] <jaubourg> true, but you still have people out there with xml heavy back-ends that serve xhtml down their xslt chain
[09:00:32] <jaubourg> sad but true
[09:00:47] <DaveMethvin> i can't believe ie FINALLY decided to support xhtml in ie10
[09:00:54] <DaveMethvin> i'm like, NOOOOO
[09:01:04] <DaveMethvin> there goes one of my excuses
[09:01:11] <jaubourg> they're funny like that at the IE office
[09:01:51] * jaubourg hugs paul_irish anyway
[09:02:10] <jaubourg> even if he never wants to support anything
[09:02:19] <DaveMethvin> having to support lots of bizarre scenarios just gets tiring
[09:02:28] <jaubourg> "I say, let's not support javascript anymore"
[09:02:46] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/489
[09:02:47] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by dmethvin (25m, 22s ago): Fix #10208. Check for `button` as well as `input`
[09:02:59] <DaveMethvin> that is for a really annoying VML bug
[09:03:08] <jaubourg> ah, yes, vml
[09:03:21] <DaveMethvin> and in general we don't support manipulating vml but in this case it's a .live() problem
[09:03:44] <DaveMethvin> the click event from within a vml element bubbles up to the html domain and we catch it
[09:03:54] <DaveMethvin> and when we touch elem.type IE dies
[09:04:12] <DaveMethvin> so if we didn't fix that it would basically make any page with vml unusable
[09:04:23] <DaveMethvin> even if they never tried touching vml with jquery
[09:04:28] <jaubourg> yeah, even when we don't wanna support something it comes back at us and pisses all over what we actually do support
[09:04:44] <jaubourg> \o/
[09:04:53] <jaubourg> gotta love web technologies
[09:05:27] <jaubourg> anyway, gotta go and get to this rpg session
[09:05:42] <DaveMethvin> in the words of dr seuss, "i do not like that vml, i do not like its bad code smell"

[09:47:45] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yt?
[09:47:59] <DaveMethvin> hey rwaldron
[09:48:22] <rwaldron> So, after a lot of thought and consideration
[09:48:36] <rwaldron> I think that Event property hooks should be postponed to 1.8
[09:49:02] <DaveMethvin> i think that's fine, we may want do fix a coupla bugs but there was nothing critical in there
[09:49:02] <rwaldron> There is already enough going on with events in the 1.7 release
[09:49:10] <rwaldron> more changes is asking for more chaos
[09:49:39] <DaveMethvin> well since we're gonna be late on getting 1.6.4 out i think 1.7 will be late too
[09:50:11] <DaveMethvin> all the 1.6.4 changes are done i think, i landed your two and  have a pr on an event one that i'll land tonight
[09:50:11] <rwaldron> 1.7 is due on to release in time for the conf?
[09:50:18] <DaveMethvin> that was the plan
[09:50:35] <DaveMethvin> but if there are a lot of changes i don't see that we can get them all tested well by then
[09:51:03] <DaveMethvin> i am finding that when i think of new event tests and add them, they fail :)
[09:51:11] <DaveMethvin> so then i need to fix those
[09:51:25] <jzaefferer> is there a branch with all changes integrated that are to land in 1.7?
[09:51:34] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer not yet
[09:51:59] <jzaefferer> seems like an indicator to me that 1.7 shouldn't not be final for the conference
[09:52:04] <DaveMethvin> yep
[09:52:06] <jzaefferer> its less than a month away
[09:52:17] <DaveMethvin> there is nothing that is pushing 1.7 to ship
[09:52:29] <DaveMethvin> if anything i think ppl would like fewer releases :)
[09:52:49] <DaveMethvin> we can still talk about plans at the conf
[09:53:06] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer your stuff with jenkins looked interesting
[09:53:28] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: just getting started
[09:53:30] <DaveMethvin> i'd love to run core tests along with ui and mobile to see what we are breaking
[09:53:42] <jzaefferer> yeah, that's one of the next steps
[09:53:56] <jzaefferer> you should sign up for an account: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/
[09:54:04] <jzaefferer> managing jobs is pretty easy
[09:54:22] <jzaefferer> and we'll have an irc bot sending notices about broken builds...
[09:54:55] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: just signed up
[09:55:35] <jzaefferer> what's your username?
[09:55:39] <DaveMethvin> dmethvin
[09:56:33] <jzaefferer> okay, you should now be able to look at the config for the jQuery UI job
[09:56:58] <jzaefferer> I plan to add a first job for core as a reference
[09:57:06] <jzaefferer> also qunit and mobile...

[12:03:00] <rwaldron> or rather, pull request message
[12:03:09] <DaveMethvin> War and Peace comes next
[12:03:36] <rwaldron> i was inspired by something i read by linus torvalds
[12:03:40] <DaveMethvin> O'Reilly called and wants to put a pic of an animal on your pull request
[12:03:45] <rwaldron> then another newer thing last night
[12:04:07] <rwaldron> linux commit messages are encouraged to be _very_ thorough
[12:04:24] <DaveMethvin> the more complicated/controversial they are the more important it is
[12:04:53] <DaveMethvin> in the case of the positional stuff I'm advocating changes on a bug closed wontfix/invalid in several tix
[12:05:04] <DaveMethvin> but the current stuff doesn't make any SENSE
[12:05:10] <DaveMethvin> look at that fiddle
[12:06:33] <DaveMethvin> my favorite: jQuery(  #firsta  ).is(  #firstp span:first  ) =  true  WHAT?!
[12:06:58] <DaveMethvin> how can an <a> match a <span> ???
[14:03:51] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 2 new commits to master: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/compare/8e8fa6d...69585ba
[14:03:51] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Fix #10208. Check for `button` as well as `input` when performing the #7071 VML crash workaround for IE special-events submit code. - Dave Methvin
[14:03:51] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Merge pull request #489 from dmethvin/fix-10208-button-type - Dave Methvin
[14:05:27] <DaveMethvin> i definitely don't like the github merge button ... thought they'd changed it but doesn't look like it
[14:05:59] <DaveMethvin> the two i merged from rick this morning look nicer
[14:06:04] <DaveMethvin> did those manually
[14:10:05] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yt?
[14:10:12] <DaveMethvin> yep
[14:10:24] <rwaldron> i just made a pull request that combines two prior pull requests
[14:10:30] <DaveMethvin> yeah i saw
[14:10:41] <rwaldron> about 2 weeks ago I asked the other two patch submitters to update and add tests
[14:10:42] <rwaldron> no one did
[14:10:46] <DaveMethvin> i will close the others
[14:10:49] <rwaldron> taking matters into my own hands
[14:10:52] <rwaldron> thanks
[14:11:22] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: I never use the button, always to merges manually
[14:11:49] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: yeah the button is NOT the way to go
[14:11:55] <rwaldron> agreed
[14:12:02] <rwaldron> i used it in an another project
[14:12:03] <jzaefferer> with the username copied, I just do 'git fork [username]' to add the remote, then 'git merge [username]/[his-branch]' to merge
[14:12:05] <rwaldron> yuck.
[14:12:23] <jzaefferer> where fork is an alias powered git the hub project
[14:12:35] <jzaefferer> adds github-specific helpers to git
[14:12:59] <rwaldron> i like the result of Pulley, but i havent used it much since the first day john released it
[14:13:06] <rwaldron> apparently timmywil is all about it
[14:13:51] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin that's it. my 1.7 stuff is in
[14:13:58] <rwaldron> timmywil ^
[14:14:13] <DaveMethvin> yay! did you push the other one to 1.8 discussion?
[14:14:23] <rwaldron> all pull requests are logged to their ticket and vice-versa
[14:14:26] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yep
[14:14:33] <rwaldron> right after we discussed
[14:14:34] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
[14:14:40] <rwaldron> no problem
[14:15:04] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin weird question...
[14:15:21] <DaveMethvin> no i don't know where the goat is
[14:15:21] <rwaldron> for some reason i thoguht i saw tickets closed for the 1.6.4 pull requests
[14:15:28] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[14:15:29] <rwaldron> but the PRs are stll open?
[14:15:35] <DaveMethvin> yeah i just closed them now
[14:15:42] <DaveMethvin> i did those manually
[14:15:52] <rwaldron> gotcha
[14:15:58] <DaveMethvin> tried pulley and  had probs so i punted for now
[14:16:12] <rwaldron> cool
[14:16:17] <rwaldron> the result is still nice
[14:16:19] <DaveMethvin> spent quite a bit of the day getting my branches all rebased
[14:16:28] <rwaldron> full message, correct credits, etc.
[14:16:46] <rwaldron> lookin' good!
[14:16:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah the one i did of my pull looks  ugly b/c i used the github button
[14:16:57] <DaveMethvin> i just need to get pulley working
[14:17:16] <DaveMethvin> john has all the details taken care of there
[14:17:25] <DaveMethvin> but i must have one or two things out of whack
[14:17:35] <timmywil> my github has a pulley adjusted just for upstream jquery
[14:17:42] <DaveMethvin> it was easier to land those patches manually than figure out pulley.js :)
[14:17:59] <DaveMethvin> timmywil:  that's what i assumed but i hadn't looked too deeply
[14:18:17] <DaveMethvin> so it's assuming the origin is the one where the PRs are
[14:18:34] <DaveMethvin> but my origin is my branch
[14:19:02] <DaveMethvin> node is cool but the resulting program is kinda ugly
[14:19:07] <DaveMethvin> all the callbacks
[14:19:21] <timmywil> you can either have a repo that is origin jquery/jquery or use the adjusted pulley
[14:19:44] <DaveMethvin> do you have the adjusted pulley somewhere?
[14:19:54] <rwaldron> timmywil do you have that branch up on your fork?
[14:19:59] <rwaldron> (not that i need it)
[14:20:02] <DaveMethvin> even a diff would save me some time
[14:20:05] * rwaldron kicks dirt
[14:20:16] * rwaldron mutters something about jitter
[14:20:18] <rwaldron> :D
[14:20:49] <DaveMethvin> haven't seen him around, noticed that jitter_ is lurking ... jitter come back we love you! :)
[14:21:02] <timmywil> I should have done it as a fork, but it was early in the project https://github.com/timmywil/pulley_upstream_jquery
[14:21:20] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin i updated one ticket to be a 1.7 ticket as well, it wasnt originally, but i editted the subject line to match the rest so that it's clearer
[14:21:36] <timmywil> the important files are pulley.js and config.js
[14:21:40] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: yeah that's a good idea
[14:21:59] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: ah thanks, the repos hash wasn't something i'd grokked  yet
[14:22:07] <rwaldron> nice, that makes me happy
[14:22:27] <rwaldron> all of my 1.7 pulls are properly labeled as such
[14:22:30] * rwaldron dances
[14:28:53] <DaveMethvin> timmywil:     getHEAD(function(){});    ?? you got some splaining to do :)
[14:29:43] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: i have no memory of that :P
[14:30:07] <DaveMethvin> i figured you were warming up your network connection or somethin' :P
[14:30:23] <timmywil> oh that must have been john
[14:30:29] <rwaldron> pfftttt
[14:31:02] <DaveMethvin> next time I land something i'll try it
[14:31:04] <timmywil> when in doubt, blame john
[14:31:06] <DaveMethvin> lol
[14:31:20] <DaveMethvin> so how about 1.6.4 tomorrow, any thoughts?
[14:31:40] <rwaldron> i'm down
[14:31:43] <DaveMethvin> if we don't do it soon i think we'll need to take gnarf's suggestion and branch it
[14:31:51] <rwaldron> I've run those patches already
[14:31:55] <rwaldron> did it over the weekend
[14:32:00] <timmywil> branch it?
[14:32:11] <DaveMethvin> make a 1.6-stable branch
[14:32:15] <DaveMethvin> then use master for 1.7
[14:32:21] <rwaldron> so unless your tickets broke it...
[14:32:24] <timmywil> how about a 1.7 branch
[14:32:32] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: no remember, blame John!
[14:32:52] <timmywil> we did that for 1.6 too
[14:32:56] <DaveMethvin> we can do it either way,it's a question of what jquery-git should be tho
[14:33:04] <timmywil> it should 1.6.4
[14:33:07] <timmywil> be*
[14:33:14] <DaveMethvin> for how long tho?
[14:33:29] <timmywil> besides, we should merge everything together off of master first
[14:33:50] <DaveMethvin> as soon as 1.6.4 is out i'd like master to be 1.7pre
[14:33:56] <DaveMethvin> so we can get some testing on that
[14:34:30] <timmywil> maybe I'm not understanding
[14:34:38] <timmywil> isn't that what I'm suggesting?
[14:34:43] <DaveMethvin> lol maybe it is
[14:35:31] <timmywil> as soon as 1.6.4 is released, master can be pile of 1.7 messiness
[14:35:38] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[14:35:55] <timmywil> but we could go ahead and start merging stuff for 1.7 on a separate branch
[14:36:02] <DaveMethvin> yep
[14:36:19] <DaveMethvin> i think jaubourg has some stuff in 1.7 branches already
[14:36:31] <timmywil> as do i
[14:36:39] <timmywil> and we have pulls
[14:36:47] <DaveMethvin> i do, on my own fork as well
[14:37:07] <DaveMethvin> so let's push 1.6.4 out tomorrow and then we can land some 1.7 stuff on friday
[14:37:12] <DaveMethvin> sound ok?
[14:37:23] <timmywil> sure, skip rc?
[14:37:30] <DaveMethvin> whatya think?
[14:37:45] <DaveMethvin> it's not a lot of changes
[14:37:56] <DaveMethvin> how about you rwaldron?
[14:37:58] <timmywil> everything is in?
[14:38:05] <DaveMethvin> at this point yes
[14:38:11] <DaveMethvin> all on master
[14:38:33] <timmywil> can we throw in the test fix for safari again?
[14:38:38] <timmywil> jaubourg
[14:38:39] <DaveMethvin> i think it's in there too
[14:38:44] <DaveMethvin> lemme check
[14:39:15] <timmywil> oh, it is in there
[14:39:19] <timmywil> how'd that happen?
[14:39:30] <DaveMethvin> i pushed it
[14:39:51] <timmywil> oh it was your merge
[14:40:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah and i've sworn off those btw
[14:40:04] <timmywil> ha, well that's kinda dirty
[14:40:14] <DaveMethvin> definitely screws up the timeline
[14:40:25] <DaveMethvin> i blame git
[14:40:29] <timmywil> lol
[14:40:31] <timmywil> sure
[14:40:43] <timmywil> ok, well that's good anyway
[14:40:46] <DaveMethvin> so anyway i think it's all there
[14:41:21] <DaveMethvin> gotta run off for a few, bbl
[14:42:33] <rwaldron> oh hai
[14:42:42] <rwaldron> shit, i missed him
[14:43:18] <rwaldron> sorry, i was writing a weird script to retrigger events from an iframe into it's parent window
[14:43:19] <rwaldron> http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/QsJDH/3/
[14:43:32] <rwaldron> anyway, timmywil DaveMethvin i think 1.6.4 is ok to roll
[14:43:42] <rwaldron> 33% is a regression fix
[14:43:48] <rwaldron> 100% passes
[14:43:55] <rwaldron> so, I
[14:44:00] <rwaldron> ack
[14:44:00] <rwaldron> +1
[14:44:31] <timmywil> I think we should rc first anyway.
[14:44:43] <rwaldron> i'm cool with that
[14:45:02] <rwaldron> i guess i just meant that i'm confident in the state as it is
[14:45:07] <rwaldron> whatever we decide to do next
[14:45:15] <timmywil> maybe rc tomorrow, release friday, and merge in 1.7 friday
[14:45:16] <rwaldron> i support it.
[14:45:23] <timmywil> cool
[14:45:51] <timmywil> ?tell DaveMethvin I vote rc wed, release friday
[14:45:51] <bot-t> timmywil, Okay.
[14:49:08] <gnarf> and what happens if you for some reason decide a 1.6.5 is needed?
[14:49:18] <gnarf> thats why it makes more sense to branch 1.6-stable at least imo
[14:57:51] <timmywil> gnarf: any bugs after 1.6.4 will have to be fixed in 1.7

[15:49:55] <DaveMethvin> docs#6754

[19:10:28] <daleharvey> sorry this is a bit of a users question, but its the type of question I would be lucky to get an answer from in #jquery :P
[19:12:10] <daleharvey> I am firing off an array of requests using deferreds and looping over the results, within the results array I need to know which request that result is referring to, is there any way to access the contect of the request, or preferably attach arbitrary data that I can access in the result?
[19:17:23] <daleharvey> http://jsfiddle.net/FwhVt/1/ is an example
[19:31:58] <danzik171> daleharvey: See pipe() for attaching arbitrary data after the request finishes
[19:47:03] <daleharvey> danzik171: .pipe is perfect, thanks
