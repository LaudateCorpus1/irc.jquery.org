[13:03:53] <m_gol> Webpack 2 vs. Rollup with tree-shaking: https://gist.github.com/forabi/2a538b263d0f1fe5f041
[13:04:03] <m_gol> markelog: ^
[13:05:25] <markelog> it seems webpack is better
[13:05:32] <markelog> ?
[13:06:25] <markelog> they say btw, that tree-shaking has a lot of issues at the momemnt
[13:06:32] <markelog> like you can't shake the lodash
[13:07:50] <markelog> using import/export might get weird, like we still would have to use ES3 syntax, but not for modules
[13:08:06] <markelog> whereas faith of import/export is not decided
[13:09:33] <markelog> > Webpack 2 vs. Rollup 
[13:09:59] <markelog> link is weird btw, doesn't look like a good invistigation 
[13:10:07] <markelog> investigation
[14:26:56] <dcherman> markelog: i think that's what lodash-es is all about - to enable tree shaking.  ex: https://gist.github.com/callumlocke/bbfc524eaed6b3556dab
[14:30:14] <markelog> that's supposed to, but it doesn't work, neither in rollup nor in webpack, currently, that's what https://github.com/lodash/lodash-webpack-plugin and https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash all about :)
[14:31:20] <markelog> there is relative bugs opened in webpack and rollup somewhere
[14:31:39] <markelog> relative -> relevant
