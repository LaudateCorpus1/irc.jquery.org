[09:51:14] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Is .live() going away ever?
[09:52:48] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: i was gonna say it's gone in 1.9  but i realized i forgot to remove it, altho the migrate plugin has all its unit tests and warns about it
[09:53:00] <DaveMethvin> and has a shim for that matter
[09:53:46] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well if it's going away in 1.9, you should get that done :-P
[09:53:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:53:59] <scott_gonzalez> Cuz you missed that in the beta...
[09:54:11] <DaveMethvin> yep, just a dumb oversight
[09:54:20] <DaveMethvin> but the plugin does warn about it at least
[09:54:31] <scott_gonzalez> So you'll drop the selector property too?
[09:54:51] <scott_gonzalez> The migrate plugin would need to override .find() to modify the property, wouldn't it?
[09:55:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah, right now its simpler to just maintain selector
[09:55:05] <scott_gonzalez> Or will you keep the selector propery in 1.9 and drop in 2.0?
[09:55:20] <scott_gonzalez> Or is the migrate plugin intended to be used with 2.0 as well?
[09:55:34] <DaveMethvin> selector only gets maintained by $() and .find() and yes migrate can be used with 2.0
[09:55:36] <scott_gonzalez> I would think if you're on 2.0, you don't get any crutches.
[09:55:46] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so 2.0 will need selector too.
[09:55:57] <DaveMethvin> it's not a lot of code, like 3 lines
[09:56:13] <DaveMethvin> i pulled out all the other selector maintenance in pushStack

[12:33:47] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I just passed the 25 jQuery.data(div) tests with the data rewrite
[12:34:43] <DaveMethvin> oh, like a big rewrite?
[12:35:11] <DaveMethvin> i'm just about to run off, but would like to subscribe to your newsletter :P
[12:35:34] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin major
[12:35:43] <rwaldron> but some of it will rely on your event stuff as well
[12:35:53] <DaveMethvin> ok
[12:36:18] <rwaldron> instead of expandos, it uses a two-array map for key => {}
[12:37:53] <DaveMethvin> i'll be back in about 45 minutes
[13:45:51] <DaveMethvin> .
[13:49:07] <ryanneufeld> is considered a Bad Thing to read the .readState of a promise returned by an ajax call?
[13:49:49] <ryanneufeld> *readyState
[13:51:24] <DaveMethvin> ryanneufeld: do you mean the .state ?
[13:51:41] <ryanneufeld> nope, I mean .readyState
[13:51:46] <ryanneufeld> which seems to be an integer
[13:51:49] <ryanneufeld> I'm guessin an enym
[13:51:52] <ryanneufeld> *enum
[13:51:59] <DaveMethvin> oh, the jqXHR
[13:52:20] <ryanneufeld> basically I'm trying to guess it's state, and cancel it if it's not resolved
[13:52:24] <DaveMethvin> what are you up to? :P
[13:52:28] <DaveMethvin> oh
[13:52:36] <DaveMethvin> like .abort() if it's not done
[13:52:57] <DaveMethvin> seems reasonable
[13:53:06] <ryanneufeld> we have a tabbed view
[13:53:09] <ryanneufeld> that I wrote myself
[13:53:15] <ryanneufeld> one tab has content on page load
[13:53:20] <ryanneufeld> the others are loaded via ajax
[13:53:42] <ryanneufeld> if you click quickly you can end up with more than one set of contents showing
[13:53:47] <ryanneufeld> I'm trying to mitigate that
[13:54:26] <DaveMethvin> how bout if you show the tab with a spinner, then fill it when the ajax completes?
[13:55:01] <DaveMethvin> that way you're not trying to show the tab asynchronously when the user may have moved on
[13:55:04] <ryanneufeld> That is what I'm doing
[13:55:10] <ryanneufeld> but if they get bored
[13:55:12] <ryanneufeld> and switch tabs
[13:55:17] <ryanneufeld> I need to cancel the ajax
[13:55:22] <DaveMethvin> how come?
[13:55:32] <DaveMethvin> just let it finish in case they tab there again
[13:55:59] <DaveMethvin> dammit you're not lazy enough! :D
[13:56:04] <ryanneufeld> ha
[13:56:08] <DaveMethvin> write LESS
[13:56:19] <ryanneufeld> oh, I'm not proud of this code
[13:56:32] <ryanneufeld> this was written when I was just getting to know jquery
[13:56:37] <DaveMethvin> there's no rule you have to show it to your mom
[13:56:42] <ryanneufeld> lol
[13:57:09] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I'm trying to prevent more than one tabs worth of content from displaying
[13:57:27] <DaveMethvin> but the container where the non-visible content is won't be showing
[13:57:41] <DaveMethvin> it will just fill whenever
[13:57:50] <ryanneufeld> I think I just have a race cond
[13:58:04] <DaveMethvin> oh, play the race card willya
[13:58:39] <DaveMethvin> sounds like you need to get on the #jquery bus ... 
[13:58:53] <ryanneufeld> ha
[13:59:15] <ryanneufeld> I usually poke gnarf, but he's been afk
[14:16:40] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: is there some magic going on with the jsonp callbacks? I noticed that giving it a custom name doesn't actually call the function with that name
[15:27:27] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin: I jsut passed all of the data tests
[15:27:44] <DaveMethvin> sweet
[15:27:51] <DaveMethvin> no leaks i hope :D
[15:27:55] <DaveMethvin> push push
[15:28:14] <DaveMethvin> i tellya, 2.0 is fun!
[15:28:19] <rwaldron> I need to make sure manipulation passes
[15:28:22] <DaveMethvin> k
[15:28:42] <rwaldron> unfortunately, I think events was relying on data internals
[15:28:45] <rwaldron> instead of the API
[15:28:53] * DaveMethvin gasps
[15:29:28] <DaveMethvin> they have a cozy relationship, let me leave it at that
[15:31:54] <rwaldron> Anyway, I think you're gonna dig the new Data system
[15:32:13] <DaveMethvin> well, that depends ... is it smaller?
[15:33:03] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin so far -217
[15:33:08] <DaveMethvin> I LIKE IT!
[15:33:12] <rwaldron> I have more to trim.
[15:33:21] <DaveMethvin> don't we all
[15:34:36] <rwaldron> fixCloneNodeIssues <--- dead.
[15:35:09] <rwaldron> this is the problem I'm running into...
[15:35:14] <rwaldron> curData.data = jQuery.extend( {}, curData.data );
[15:35:28] <rwaldron> cloneCopyEvent shouldn't have done that
[15:35:32] <DaveMethvin> different object?
[15:35:33] <rwaldron> I think that's my fault
[15:37:06] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: remember that one of the reasons i wanted to do this before 1.9 release was so that we could change the rules in both places, if needed
[15:37:25] <DaveMethvin> so if you run into sticky situations let us know and we can discuss as a team
[15:38:35] <rwaldron> naw, this is not worth that attention
[15:43:16] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin a major problem I'm having now is that acceptData is no longer a valid concept
[15:43:32] <DaveMethvin> yeah i thought about that, what's the problem?
[15:43:51] <DaveMethvin> you can stub it out with return true for now 
[15:43:56] <rwaldron> since nothing actually touches those elements, there is no need to pay special attention
[15:44:00] <rwaldron> but we have a lot of tests that do
[15:44:06] <rwaldron> I did that
[15:44:13] <rwaldron> but a lot of tests what false
[15:44:23] <DaveMethvin> oh, we test for the negative
[15:44:24] <DaveMethvin> ?
[15:44:42] <DaveMethvin> kind of gray-box testing there
[15:44:56] <snover> but they all pass right
[15:45:02] <snover> :)
[15:45:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah as long as they pass
[15:45:11] <rwaldron> Well thats the problem
[15:45:16] <rwaldron> they DO
[15:45:40] <rwaldron> but we ahve tests that don't want them to
[15:45:49] <rwaldron> or expect them to be ignored
[15:46:41] <DaveMethvin> we may need to refactor the tests somehow, and push that back to 1.9
[15:47:02] <DaveMethvin> i guess the problem is that we silently ignore situations where we can't set data
[15:47:33] <DaveMethvin> nothing that can't be solved with a jQuery.__reallyDidntSetTheData flag
[15:47:38] * DaveMethvin runs away
[15:48:37] <rwaldron> *facepalm*
[15:48:45] <rwaldron> I need to call it quits for the night
[15:48:51] <rwaldron> I'll push this so you can peak
[15:49:00] <DaveMethvin> np rwaldron, glad you had fun with data
