[22:41:13] <slide> I'm creating a plugin that basically manages widget layouts so I have  'sections', 'rows', 'columns' and 'widgets' and right now my main plugin object is manipulating them all but it's starting to get a LOT of methods and I was hoping to break them up into maybe object 'classes'? I'm not sure how to accomplish this though, does anyone know of a plugin that does something simimlar or a tutorial or anything?
