[04:38:00] <poacher2k> Hi. Not entirely sure if this is a bug or not, but it seems to me there is some inconsistency in how .append() works when appending something with a data-attribute, and how it fetches it. 
[04:38:15] <poacher2k> http://jsfiddle.net/agnyu/
[04:39:32] <poacher2k> The data-attribute appended gets lowercased, while .data() accepts mixed case.
[04:44:48] <m_gol> poacher2k: this works as intended, HTML is case insensitive so you should always use lowercase letters
[04:45:18] <markelog> poacher2k: it might be helpful too - http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-*-attributes
[04:46:59] <poacher2k> That is indeed very helpful. Thanks alot. Any thoughts on why .data() is not case insensitive?
[04:52:32] <m_gol> poacher2k: because data-attributes get camelized before being put in Data
[04:53:02] <m_gol> so data-at-tr='a' gives you .data('atTr') === .data('at-tr') === 'a'
[04:53:34] <m_gol> poacker2k: support is generally in #jquery, let's move it there if you have further questions
[04:53:48] <poacher2k> Sure thing! Thanks!
[07:02:44] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: haha, Firefox now started warning against using `//@`
[07:02:47] <m_gol> good we switched...
[07:03:20] <DaveMethvin> well, except that we don't have a version out with that yet
[07:03:29] <DaveMethvin> geez
[07:05:30] <m_gol> yeah
[07:05:55] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: indeed, I've just caught it on a page with jQuery 2.0.3 :P
[07:06:41] <DaveMethvin> those messages drive me crazy because users will be seeing them forever on a page that is using older versions, even after we release
[07:06:58] <m_gol> I kind of understand their reasons
[07:07:06] <m_gol> to drive web devs to use new versions
[07:07:08] <m_gol> but so fast...
[07:08:54] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: but that's true that older sites will make this warning appear always; do you have any better ideas how browsers should deal with that?
[07:09:21] <DaveMethvin> i think they should accept both for at least a year
[07:09:33] <DaveMethvin> silently
[07:10:04] <DaveMethvin> it's not like this affects end-user behavior
[07:10:11] <DaveMethvin> it's only whether the debugger sees the map
[07:10:18] <scott_gonzalez> It's only developers that see the warning
[07:10:26] <scott_gonzalez> Normal users won't have the console open.
[07:10:45] <DaveMethvin> sure but that never stopped developers from screaming at us
[07:10:54] <scott_gonzalez> Scream back at them :-)
[07:11:07] <m_gol> yeah, my main concern is they throw these deprecation warnings way too fast
[07:11:11] <DaveMethvin> dev logic: browser error message contains the word "jQuery" therefore it must be jQuery's fault
[07:11:20] <m_gol> :)
[07:12:07] <m_gol> they should scream less once we have a new version with the pragma changed
[07:12:12] <m_gol> let's see what happens until then
[07:13:06] <DaveMethvin> there is no need for a console message at all IMO. the debugger could have a message come up when you try to use it if the map file is not there or whatever
