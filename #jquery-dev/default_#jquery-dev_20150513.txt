[06:59:59] <m_gol> jzaefferer: would 301-redirecting those files for some time & later removing them be enough? or what official information would you expect?
[07:00:25] <m_gol> a blog post seems too much as it's not a service we want to encourage a lot of people looking at if they don't know what it's for
[07:13:08] <arschmitz> timmywil: Some of your offset changes have severely broken jquery-ui
[07:13:44] <arschmitz> timmywil: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/1617479fcf7cbdaf33dc9334ed10a0f30bf14687
[07:13:47] <arschmitz> is the culprit
[07:18:41] <DaveMethvin> arschmitz: the method now dies if you try to get the offset of a disconnected element, is that the problem?
[07:20:07] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: i assume you mean https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/0d11c1182f2012cd6eb06ce1e3fa5a495af9bee3
[07:20:59] <DaveMethvin> right
[07:21:04] <arschmitz> thats not it
[07:21:11] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[07:21:11] <arschmitz> this is caused by https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/1617479fcf7cbdaf33dc9334ed10a0f30bf14687
[07:21:53] <arschmitz> though we have a bunch of other failures in offset from something else i'm still trying to find 
[07:22:25] <DaveMethvin> the main change there is that now we consider elements to be visible if they have a bounding box
[07:23:56] <arschmitz> something in it is causeing .left to come back undefined 
[07:24:07] <DaveMethvin> oh that's not good 
[07:25:23] <arschmitz> nope
[07:26:37] <DaveMethvin> is .left undefined, or is the method returning undefined?
[07:26:55] <arschmitz> and something else prior to that im looking for is causing elem.getBoundingClientRect() to throw Uncaught TypeError: elem.getBoundingClientRect is not a function
[07:27:20] <arschmitz> and its not failing our tests but is breaking the actual widget which is extra bad
[07:28:38] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: the method is returning undefined
[07:29:51] <DaveMethvin> ok, that would happen if the element itself isn't visible or isn't in the document
[07:31:14] <arschmitz> ok so its probably just our tests for that one
[07:31:32] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ^^
[07:34:28] <DaveMethvin> arschmitz: yeah these errors are strange http://swarm.jquery.org/result/286347
[07:45:03] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: actually it is that same commit thats breaking our position utility
[07:45:37] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: sorry i forgot we use different copies of jquery in demos and tests so i was not actually updating the demos each time lol
[07:45:57] <arschmitz> This is actually breaking the widget though not our tests
[07:46:04] <DaveMethvin> well at least it's narrowed down to one commit
[07:46:16] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: yup
[07:47:00] <DaveMethvin> that's supposed to only return undef if the element isn't visible or isn't in the doc, so i'm wondering what the calling element looks like
[07:47:07] <DaveMethvin> seems to be across browsers too
[07:47:18] <DaveMethvin> so it's not something like gBCR being missing
[07:50:08] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: https://gist.github.com/arschmitz/1ded98d7ce33958dd8d6
[07:50:39] <DaveMethvin> haha
[07:50:45] <DaveMethvin> ok, so what is elem there?
[07:51:57] <arschmitz> its the submenu
[07:52:00] <arschmitz> of the menu
[07:52:13] <DaveMethvin> but it's a div or something?
[07:52:44] <arschmitz> ul
[07:53:30] <DaveMethvin> what should the return value be there? i'm wondering if it fell into the !contains case before and returned [0,0]
[07:53:32] <jqcommit> [13api.jquery.com] 15arthurvr closed issue #739: Document $.ready in 2.x and 1.x 02http://git.io/vU8HQ
[07:54:33] <DaveMethvin> because we already were using gBCR before, but it was after that check
[07:55:29] <arschmitz> sorry that may be it just a sec
[07:59:47] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: ok so the call breaks down to $( window ).offset() in the end
[08:00:01] <DaveMethvin> that seems fishy
[08:00:47] <arschmitz> yeah calling offset on window throws
[08:00:59] <DaveMethvin> used to return [0,0]
[08:01:06] <arschmitz> undefined
[08:01:36] <arschmitz> and we did withinElement.offset() || { left: 0, top: 0 }
[08:01:48] <arschmitz> so undefined was what we expected
[08:01:57] <DaveMethvin> oh right because of the doc check
[08:02:46] <DaveMethvin> so i guess we need to figure out if  $( window ).offset() is a valid use caes
[08:02:48] <DaveMethvin> case
[08:03:07] <DaveMethvin> it doesn't seem like it but we may need to support it if a lot of code is doing it
[08:03:27] <arschmitz> ui has forever
[08:03:38] <arschmitz> because we just do $( element || window )
[08:03:49] <arschmitz> and then expect undefined in the case of window
[08:04:08] <DaveMethvin> yeah, but it doesn't really make sense to get the offset of a window
[08:04:22] <DaveMethvin> returning undefined is a strong enough signal i suppose
[08:04:32] <arschmitz> no i agree its not really a valid case but we depend on the behivor
[08:04:33] <DaveMethvin> we can look for gBCR and return undefined then too
[08:04:47] <DaveMethvin> file a bug and timmywil can sort it out :)
[08:05:05] <arschmitz> will do
