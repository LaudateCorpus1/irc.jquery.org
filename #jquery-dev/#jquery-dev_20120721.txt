[01:16:43] <surunt> Anybody can help me regarding Dropdown Menuin Jquery,i found a Sample on http://www.jqueryload.com/jquery-dropdown-menu-with-google-style, but its sub->Sublevel not working perfectly
[10:59:12] <jga> is this the right syntax for custom builds? ./node_modules/.bin/grunt custom:-ajax,-css,-dimensions,-effects,-offset
[11:09:57] <gnarf> jga: just responded to that in #jquery
[11:13:21] <gnarf> clarkbox: you around today?
[14:50:52] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: got a minute?
[14:51:46] <mikesherov> or really anyone… any thoughts on how I can unit test cors?
[14:52:29] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: here ... jaubourg might have some thoughts
[14:52:51] <DaveMethvin> if someone were to preload another name into their hosts file it could be done that way
[14:53:05] <mikesherov> Yeah, I can test locally by making a second /etc/host entry for 127.0.0.1
[14:53:11] <mikesherov> RIght
[14:53:17] <mikesherov> I've done that
[14:53:43] <mikesherov> Won't work in browserstack :-)
[14:54:01] <DaveMethvin> right, and in general anything that requires futzing will not be futzed correctly
[14:54:14] <DaveMethvin> always nice to keep it simple and within the project somehow
[14:54:36] <mikesherov> right
[14:54:41] <DaveMethvin> i don't know how to solve that particular problem without some sort of external setup change tho
[14:54:51] <mikesherov> any thoughts that don't require jquery hosting an endpoint?
[14:54:59] <mikesherov> jinx
[14:55:30] <DaveMethvin> nope, no easy solution I can think of
[14:55:42] <mikesherov> is it feasible to do that?
[14:56:08] <mikesherov> i.e. have jquery host a cors endpoint similar to jsfiddle's echo?
[14:56:35] <mikesherov> or will we be forever condemned to not testing our cors implementation?
[14:56:41] <DaveMethvin> seems like it's doable, not sure about security implications
[14:57:07] <DaveMethvin> we'd want something where we could echo back any headers we wanted to test i'd think
[14:57:23] <DaveMethvin> altho perhaps we could have different endpoints with different settings echoed
[14:57:52] <mikesherov> sure
[14:58:46] <mikesherov> so, who should I ping? gnarf?
[14:59:04] <DaveMethvin> gnarf would be a good start to see what he thinks
[14:59:16] <DaveMethvin> lessee, the swarm is on swarm.jquery.org
[14:59:18] <DaveMethvin> ?
[14:59:32] <mikesherov> right, I started there too
[14:59:34] <DaveMethvin> so even corstest.jquery.org is cross domain
[14:59:56] <DaveMethvin> just thinking about where it might go
[15:00:07] <DaveMethvin> and which domains could be allowed
[15:00:16] <DaveMethvin> we'd need access for local testing
[15:00:21] <mikesherov> sure
[15:00:44] <DaveMethvin> atm, local testing is truly local, no internet required
[15:00:52] <DaveMethvin> so that's a bit of a downside
[15:00:55] <mikesherov> well, almost
[15:01:00] <DaveMethvin> altho you could skip ajax
[15:01:04] <mikesherov> sure
[15:01:51] <mikesherov> the current unit test suite has one outside link to a jpg
[15:03:20] <mikesherov> ok, i'll ping gnarf later… thanks Dave!
[18:14:42] <gnarf> b-ot: tell mikesherov how about just make it a GET param to the test... IE. on mine it could be http://jquery.local/jquery/test/unit?cors=http://not.jquery.local/jquery/
[18:14:42] <b-ot> gnarf, I’ll tell mikesherov about that.
[18:35:47] <gnarf> b-ot: tell mikesherov swarm would always have it in the url because its defined in the swarm submission.  Also is it possible to have a consistent endpoint online? then you could just enable it for those of us who need to test it with like ?cors in the url
[18:35:47] <b-ot> gnarf, I’ll tell mikesherov about that.
[18:35:52] <b-ot> gnarf, memorised “Also”.
[18:35:57] <b-ot> gnarf, no YOU could just enable it for those of us who need to test it with like
[18:36:03] <gnarf> heh
[18:36:07] <gnarf> b-ot: forget also
[18:36:08] <b-ot> gnarf, I can’t forget that which I do not know.
[18:36:13] <gnarf> b-ot: forget Also
[18:36:13] <b-ot> gnarf, I have forgotten “Also”. My mind is going, I can feel it.
