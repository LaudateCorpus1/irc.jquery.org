[16:55:30] <kswedberg> gnarf, danheberden (someone else?): api.jquery.com seems to be down now. "Error establishing a database connection." I pushed a couple fixes to the repo a bit ago. Maybe that has something to do with it?
[16:58:59] <kswedberg> mikesherov. do you know how to kick start the api site?
[18:32:43] <mmanrique_> so guys, I'd like to contrib to jquery, do I need to have found a bug on my own? or can I just pick  one from the ones listed in the site?
[19:44:16] <ajpiano> mmanrique: you don't need to have found it on your own :)
[19:44:39] <ajpiano> helping out with already identified bugs is *definitely* appreciated
[19:46:01] <mmanrique> ajpiano: thanks, I'll take a look at the bugs and see which I can solve. I'm just getting into the open source community :)
[19:47:37] <ajpiano> mmanrique: it's not just bugs in jquery itself... there are the other jquery projects such as ui and mobile, as well as all our web sites and documentation etc
[19:47:47] <ajpiano> help anywhere is appreciated
[19:48:03] <ajpiano> i'm just here at the comp briefly, ping me again during the week if you still haven't found your way :)
