[07:16:33] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: "Let's put it out of our misery." ZING!
[07:17:21] <gibson042> :)
[07:19:20] <gibson042> the documentation is practically a suicide note
[08:07:20] <Stephen> Why was TestSwarm access changed?
[08:09:32] <Stephen> No one can speak to TestSwarm?
[08:11:11] <mikesherov> Many can, they just aren't here at the moment :-P
[08:11:25] <mikesherov> Usually, Krinkle can
[08:11:35] <mikesherov> but he's -away at the moment
[08:24:20] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: quick question
[08:25:57] <mikesherov> actually, nvm, I'll just ask the question when I submit the PR
[11:52:17] <mikesherov> .

[13:21:48] <Krinkle> mikesherov: I don't know of any access changes? Not in the last 2-3 months at least
[13:22:05] <mikesherov> ?
[13:22:07] <Krinkle> Who is this Stephen though ?
[13:22:13] <Krinkle> (5 hours ago)
[13:22:16] <Krinkle> I was -away
[13:22:21] <mikesherov> I have no idea, just a guy who asked a question
[13:22:31] <Krinkle> o
[13:22:32] <Krinkle> ok
[13:24:01] <Krinkle> $(".this").is(":not(.that)")
[13:24:25] <Krinkle> $(".he").is(":not(.me)")
[13:24:50] <Krinkle> Hey would be a fun challenge to try to convert some basic story into a valid jQuery chain
[13:24:57] <mikesherov> LOL
[13:25:10] <Krinkle> "we are not :even"
[13:33:43] <Krinkle> $(this).is('.triumph'); :D
[13:34:03] <Krinkle> $(this).is('a.triumph');
[16:29:33] <Stephen> I actually prefer to contain all scopes in closures emitted by a ScopeFactory
[16:29:40] <Stephen> j/k
