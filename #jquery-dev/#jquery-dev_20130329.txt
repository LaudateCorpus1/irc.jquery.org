[00:44:42] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle|detached: ben_alman's space vs. tab caveat is that the spaces guarantee how your consumers sees your code
[06:03:53] <robtarr> Does anybody have suggestions for running the jQuery test suite on multiple browsers simultaneously? I was thinking about hooking up Testem, but it was not cooperating, and I wanted to see what others are using for this. Thanks.

[08:02:49] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Migrate Core 1.x build #45: SUCCESS in 1 min 50 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Migrate%20Core%201.x/45/
[08:22:12] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Should we just close everything at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-compat-1.3/issues as wontfix?
[08:22:44] <DaveMethvin> oh wow, didn't even know those were around
[08:22:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah we might as well close them
[08:23:58] <scott_gonzalez> done
[08:25:16] <scott_gonzalez> What are we doing about things like datalink?
[08:25:47] <DaveMethvin> good question, same with jquery-tmpl
[08:25:51] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[08:25:57] <DaveMethvin> how do we orphan something?
[08:26:01] <DaveMethvin> do you have a basket?
[08:26:11] <scott_gonzalez> We can make a basket :-)
[08:26:27] <scott_gonzalez> github.com/jquery-orphans
[08:26:31] <DaveMethvin> let's make a new repo, drop it there, ring the doorbell, and run like hell
[08:27:02] <scott_gonzalez> We can ask Boris if he wants us to transfer them to his account.
[08:27:33] <DaveMethvin> that would make sense ... for the others the orphan acct sounds good
[08:28:10] <DaveMethvin> of course that means we need an announcement on the blog etc
[08:28:25] <DaveMethvin> but if Google can clean house occasionally so can we
[08:29:25] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's not like we're providing any value, other than being able to get the code.
[08:29:32] <scott_gonzalez> Moving to another account keeps that ability.
[08:29:41] <scott_gonzalez> We're never going to land a bug fix or feature update.
[09:20:05] <DaveMethvin> timmywil gibson042 fire at will https://forum.jquery.com/topic/speed-up-unique-uniquesort
[10:20:10] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15gibson042 opened pull request #1215: [DEPENDENCY HOLD] Almost fix #13539: use Sizzle.selectors.attrHandle instead of overriding Sizzle.attr (061.9-stable...0613539)  02http://git.io/1x9TPw
[10:22:47] <DaveMethvin> "Almost fix #13539" that's some honesty right there
[10:23:45] <gibson042> DaveMethvin dependency handling's a bitch, amirite
[10:24:45] <DaveMethvin> true but, look at dem bytes!
[10:25:29] <gibson042> now we know the cost of near-duplicating Sizzle methods
[10:26:53] <gibson042> also, with this now out I can start hitting the 1.10/2.0 stuff
[10:27:27] <DaveMethvin> yay! yeah i'm behind where i wanted to be
[10:27:32] <DaveMethvin> lots of stuff going on with work
[10:27:55] <DaveMethvin> but i love seeing byte counts go down!
[10:30:20] <gibson042> I think we're at the point where that 1.x branch ought to exist... should it branch directly from the current 1.9-stable head?
[10:30:41] <DaveMethvin> seems like a good place to start
[10:32:18] <gibson042> cool; I'll do that tonight if noone beats me to it
[10:38:55] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: I have a legit ticket for next build
[10:39:19] <DaveMethvin> finally, so damn sick of those illegit tickets  you always find
[10:39:32] <mikesherov> we should stop using offsetWidth and height in our css width and height calculations
[10:39:38] <DaveMethvin> yep
[10:40:11] <DaveMethvin> and then, deal with breakage from 8 years worth of plugins that expect integer width/height
[10:40:19] <DaveMethvin> dunno how to deal with that
[10:40:41] <mikesherov> we can provide back compat
[10:40:53] <mikesherov> I'll figure that out
[10:40:57] <DaveMethvin> okay, i'm subscribing to your newsletter
[10:41:19] <mikesherov> the question is, do we want to use gCBR instead?
[10:41:31] <mikesherov> it'll give subpixel values
[10:41:43] <mikesherov> but it also respects transforms and friends
[10:41:51] <DaveMethvin> which is good
[10:42:01] <mikesherov> I suppose it is
[10:42:07] <mikesherov> just opens some worms there
[10:42:12] <DaveMethvin> i dunno ... like i said, you know that it will break some assumptions
[10:42:47] <DaveMethvin> and as 1.9 showed us, nobody is gonna tell us about it in beta
[13:20:40] <scott_gonzalez> I hate .substr(). I can never remember which is the real version.
[13:22:36] <DaveMethvin> substr, substring, slice, charAt ... aw screw it i'll use (/^(.{,5})/.exec(s)||[])[1]
[13:29:54] <gibson042> slice it up, scott_gonzalez
[13:30:07] <gibson042> Array, string, NodeList, jQuery collection... slice
[13:30:45] <scott_gonzalez> gibson042: In old browsers too?
[13:32:51] <gibson042> back to IE6 at least
[13:42:24] <scott_gonzalez> good to know
[17:20:49] <gseguin> rwaldron: ping
[17:22:15] <gseguin> rwaldron: Is there a reason why core is not using grunt-compare-size?
[17:34:38] <rwaldron> gseguin we are, just waiting for some updates to output
[17:34:40] <rwaldron> ttyl
[17:35:17] <gseguin> oh ok, I didn't see the dot file in the repo, hence my question
[17:35:38] <gseguin> do you not store it in the repo?
[17:42:19] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: That's the only reason? I fail to see the significance of enforcing consumers to see a certain identation.
[17:42:39] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: Editors/IDEs have colors, fonts, highlighting patterns etc. that's all personal preference
[17:43:04] <Krinkle> I'd say the size of a tab is part of those preferences, no point in fixing that. How can that do anything good?
[17:43:16] <Krinkle> By making it a tab, the consumer will always see the same size
[17:43:56] <Krinkle> And depending on your editor, tabs are easier to insert.
[17:44:02] <Krinkle> No messing with alignment etc.
[17:46:08] <Krinkle> I'd say indentation type is in the category of style that isn't personal preference but has workflow advantages. Tabs are a win.
[17:46:34] <Krinkle> But the gut has a hard time getting convinced of that.
[17:46:38] <Krinkle> Takes time
[19:50:35] <_JamesMGreene> Krinkle|detached: I was steadfastly a tab man until ben_alman came around with his spaces soapbox :)
[20:14:19] <nschonni> the editorconfig files have made me now care about the tabs vs spaces
[20:14:41] <nschonni> as long as i don't have to reach out and change the settings for each project i'm happy
