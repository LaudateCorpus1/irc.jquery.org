[04:16:26] <addyosmani> bot-t1: tell DaveMethvin danheberden I'd appreciate your input on https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/39. Would really help me with a game plan for some of the learning site content updates
[04:16:27] <bot-t1> addyosmani, Okay.

[12:48:18] <danheberden> DaveMethvin oh how well you do what you do " where you would be shot, then drawn and quartered, for mutating an incoming object! "
[12:48:41] <DaveMethvin> i was just tired of having my inbox clogged!

[12:49:01] <danheberden> haha, what bout the bot-t inbox?
[12:49:01] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah i wanted to reply to that, saw you already did danheberden
[12:53:38] <DaveMethvin> "Thanks for the advice, Dave, Imma ignore it and do the wrong thing."
[12:54:28] <danheberden> haha
[18:47:11] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you here?
[18:47:25] <mikesherov> Didn't mean to come across as snippy in that github comment
[18:47:38] <mikesherov> I realize after I wrote it that it may come across that way
[18:48:17] <DaveMethvin> no, you're RIGHT
[18:48:28] <DaveMethvin> i was just about to go over to mobile-dev and ask
[18:48:41] <DaveMethvin> because we never do seem to know
[18:49:02] <DaveMethvin> but i can bet as soon as we take out that code we'll break mobile for some old phone
[18:50:01] <DaveMethvin> ok mikesherov here's the jqm list: http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/
[18:50:28] <DaveMethvin> is there a place where we can reliably look up webkit bugs?
[18:50:41] <mikesherov> Sort of
[18:50:51] <DaveMethvin> damn i wish we were better at xreffing these bugs to browser tickets
[18:51:22] <mikesherov> not only that, but we don't comment in our code what browser even made us add the support test
[18:51:27] <mikesherov> that should be a rule!
[18:51:57] <mikesherov> the thing about the jquerymobile.com/gbs is that it's ridiculous
[18:52:08] <mikesherov> respectfully, it's ridiculous
[18:52:15] <DaveMethvin> well we only care about A
[18:52:19] <DaveMethvin> imo
[18:52:27] <mikesherov> even A is crazy
[18:52:31] <DaveMethvin> but the list is still damn long
[18:52:32] <mikesherov> original iPhone
[18:52:38] <DaveMethvin> that's the list where almost everything has to work
[18:52:41] <mikesherov> original iPhone, iOS 3.1
[18:52:48] <DaveMethvin> safari3 right?
[18:52:53] <mikesherov> well, sort of
[18:53:24] <mikesherov> the question we should be asking of jquerymobile is how important is it to really support original unupgraded iPhone?
[18:53:41] <mikesherov> like, that's less than 1% of phones
[18:54:01] <DaveMethvin> i am not opposed to removing bulky fixes that aren't critical functionality
[18:54:21] <mikesherov> right, I'm sure you and I are on the same page
[18:54:22] <DaveMethvin> but if it's used by jqm and would break their code then it makes it hard to remove
[18:54:57] <DaveMethvin> it would be nice if they could drop those older browsers to B-grade or whatever
[18:55:03] <mikesherov> the thing that I kep coming back to... is that we seem to have to support every browser jqm supports, but that relationship is implied
[18:55:11] <mikesherov> isn't mentioned anywhere on the jquery site
[18:55:28] <mikesherov> nor does the core team, myself included, seem to know exactly what we're supposed to be supporting
[18:55:32] <DaveMethvin> well "support" isn't black or white either
[18:55:37] <mikesherov> a lot more coordination seems to be implied
[18:56:04] <DaveMethvin> so if there is some strange issue that happens with positioning but jqm itself doesn't run into the problem, it may not be an issue frequently enough to justify keeping the code
[18:56:17] <mikesherov> Like, there should really be a person who is responsible specifically for facilitating jquery core and mobile playing nice
[18:56:40] <DaveMethvin> ok i nominate  you :P
[18:56:43] <mikesherov> HAHAHA
[18:56:50] <mikesherov> k, you got me
[18:56:53] <DaveMethvin> whoops, not so good an idea NOW is it?
[18:56:55] <DaveMethvin> lol
[18:57:01] <DaveMethvin> but again i agree
[18:57:01] <mikesherov> No, I think it's a great idea
[18:57:26] <mikesherov> I'd gladly do it. I guess I'm just spinning my wheels
[18:57:45] <DaveMethvin> if you pinged them and expained the situation maybe we can get things started
[18:57:48] <mikesherov> Like, I want to remove that crap ton of offset code, and according to our statement of support, it can be safely removed
[18:58:03] <DaveMethvin> i just got going again myself, trying to update my node.js
[18:58:12] <mikesherov> ah, I see
[18:58:26] <DaveMethvin> turns out they created an installer for windows and it installs in a path that has a space
[18:58:29] <DaveMethvin> soooo
[18:58:32] <DaveMethvin> it breaks the makefile
[18:58:40] <DaveMethvin> but also there is some problem with reading pipes
[18:59:00] <DaveMethvin> so two hours later i've got it working
[18:59:08] <mikesherov> hooray, I guess
[18:59:21] <DaveMethvin> yay for being back to the starting line
[18:59:51] <DaveMethvin> so my plan is to spend the next week or so getting a 1.7.2 ready
[19:00:06] <DaveMethvin> figuring out tickets, landing some pull request, etc
[19:00:55] <mikesherov> OK, I'm in
[19:01:04] <mikesherov> whatever I can do to help sort that out
[19:01:24] <mikesherov> there are a lot of patches for things that are in the 1.7.2 milestone according to Trac
[19:01:32] <mikesherov> although, I don't know how great that list is
[19:01:40] <mikesherov> http://www.quora.com/What-proportion-of-all-iPhone-owners-use-iOS4-%2a-today
[19:01:55] <DaveMethvin> yep, and i'd like to have most of it landed so -git is close to what we will rlease
[19:02:42] <DaveMethvin> come to think of it, the impact of pulling this is that cloned checkboxes will lose their checked state IF THEY WERE CHECKED
[19:02:50] <DaveMethvin> that is not a catastrophe
[19:03:12] <mikesherov> and only for super old iPhone
[19:03:31] <DaveMethvin> right
[19:03:32] <mikesherov> also, can't even get a good answer as to what version of safari iOS 4 is
[19:04:04] <DaveMethvin> http://memegenerator.net/instance/13093269
[19:05:13] <DaveMethvin> i'd say that is a 1.8 change tho, since technically we will be removing support for a browser
[19:05:25] <DaveMethvin> we need to create a 1.8 branch so we can land this stuff
[19:05:54] <DaveMethvin> or conversely make master the 1.8 branch and create a 1.7-stable
[19:05:54] <mikesherov> yup
[19:06:02] <DaveMethvin> we'd need to change some scripts for that
[19:06:08] <mikesherov> I'm fine with holding off on removing support tests till 1.8
[19:06:15] <mikesherov> that's what semantic versioning demands anyway
[19:06:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[19:06:48] <mikesherov> But there are plenty of good bug fixes in the PR queue ready for 1.7.2
[19:07:05] <mikesherov> and there is my include_js.php PR which would be GREAT to merge now
[19:07:07] <mikesherov> hint hint
[19:07:14] <DaveMethvin> i think i am going to get a good night's sleep and do that tomorrow
[19:07:21] <mikesherov> K
[19:07:38] <mikesherov> if you need a hand, I can jump on around noonish tomorrow
[19:07:48] <DaveMethvin> ok, thanks
[19:08:03] <DaveMethvin> i may ping you if things take an ugly turn for some reason
[19:08:06] <DaveMethvin> :D
[19:09:33] <mikesherov> k
[19:13:07] <mikesherov> ...
[19:13:32] <mikesherov> So, does anyone know if IE did there autoupdate thing in Brazil and Australia today?
[19:42:48] <gf3> wycats: good post, being a rubyist I tend to agree with you
[19:43:17] <gf3> wycats: althoughI think the syntax could be improved to make it more javascript-y
[19:44:10] <gf3> wycats: e.g.: this.withFile( f ) { … }
[20:08:49] <tbranyen> gf3: one thing i was thinking in that post was if you didn't put returns in the middle of functions
[20:09:18] <gf3> tbranyen: hmm?
[20:10:14] <tbranyen> well one concern was that returns don't work in the outer function context
[20:28:10] <mikesherov> Anyone know if IE was autoupdated in Brazil and Australia today?
