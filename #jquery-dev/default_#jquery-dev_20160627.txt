[12:52:55] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: one problem with Migrate is that it's test suite is rather small
[12:52:58] <m_gol> so it's easy to regress
[12:53:16] <m_gol> ideally we'd run the whole jQuery test suite with some assertions modified but that's not easy as well
[12:53:27] <m_gol> * it's -> its
[12:54:08] <gibson042> at least on our own, if not with automated CI
[12:54:47] <m_gol> yeah but "on our own" sometimes means "never" or "too rarely" :)
[12:55:02] <DaveMethvin> i agree, Migrate needs a more extensive test suite but since it's supposed to change behavior it breaks many unit tests from core
[12:56:10] <m_gol> that's because it does two different things: warns about potential problems and reverts some of the changes
[12:56:24] <m_gol> so jQuery+Migrate is kind of a jQuery between versions + warnings
[12:56:34] <gibson042> jQuery v(major) + jQuery Migrate v(major) should always pass the jQuery v(major - 1) suite
[12:56:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[12:56:59] <gibson042> that's the thing to automate
[12:57:12] <DaveMethvin> although that's in theory, i'd be interested to know if it works that way in practice :)
[12:57:47] <DaveMethvin> not every change has a Migrate fill for example
[12:57:51] <m_gol> it's easy to check, I may run it and see how much it breaks just out of curiosity
[12:57:55] <gibson042> but those are flaws
[12:58:05] <gibson042> they should at least have tickets
[12:58:10] <gibson042> and I think they all do
[12:58:26] <DaveMethvin> promise/a+ 
[12:58:32] <DaveMethvin> show/hide has one
[12:59:01] <DaveMethvin> some of the stuff is hard or impossible to detect and/or fill
[12:59:16] <DaveMethvin> i suppose we could document all those cases tho
[12:59:42] <gibson042> yeah
[12:59:49] <m_gol> perhaps we could at least copy the test suite from Core major-1 and mark some tests that are breaking and we don't know how to easily fix as skipped
[13:00:03] <m_gol> but make sure we don't regress on the rest
[13:00:12] <gibson042> I'm imagining a copy of jQuery v(minor - 1) test/ committed into jQuery Migrate, where we can comment out as needed
[13:00:22] <gibson042> IOW, what m_gol said :)
[13:00:25] <m_gol> :)
[13:01:04] <DaveMethvin> i'm for it, you want to create a ticket m_gol ?
[13:01:12] <m_gol> sure, will do in a moment
[13:01:29] <m_gol> I forgot to mention one thing at the meeting - the API docs for Core are seriously out of date wrt jQuery 3.0. Many deprecated & even removed APIs are not marked as such in the docs.
[13:02:37] <DaveMethvin> do you have a list? Might be easier to have one ticket at api.jquery.com and fix them all at once if it's just deprecated/removed markings
[13:04:12] <jqcommit> [13jquery-migrate] 15mgol opened issue #201: Migrate meant to aid upgrading to jQuery n should have tests run on jQuery n-1 02https://git.io/vo7kA
[13:04:27] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I don't but probably going through the upgrade guide should generate a big enough list
[13:06:18] <m_gol> of the top off my head: the removal of .size() & .andSelf, deferred changes, data changes
[13:06:32] <m_gol> ah, no, sorry, data is covered
[13:07:59] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: but we don't even have the section for stuff deprecated in 3.0 :)
[13:09:14] <m_gol> bind/unbind/delegate/undelegate deprecation is nowhere in the docs
[13:09:59] <DaveMethvin> we also have some active tickets about deprecating things, we should agree/disagree on those and get them into the docs asap
[13:10:02] <m_gol> one PR should be enough for deprecations/removals, let's hope that's the most of the missing bits
[13:10:29] <m_gol> technically speaking semver allows to deprecate stuff in minor versions, not patch
[13:10:53] <m_gol> but we don't warn for deprecated stuff in Core so that's mostly applying to Migrate
[13:11:14] <m_gol> although we do need to put a version in the docs if we're deprecating sth
[13:12:00] <m_gol> ok, no, there's one thing we do in Core when we deprecate something: if possible, we're moving it to the deprecated module :-)
[13:12:04] <m_gol> so it affects jquery.slim
[13:12:20] <m_gol> and we stop using it internally if we have (vide jQuery.parseJSON)
[13:13:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's hard to warn in migrate unless we stop using it internally too
[13:13:33] <m_gol> I'l try to PR the deprecations in on Wednesday
[13:13:43] <m_gol> we discussed most of it, the tickets are just waiting for PRs
[13:13:51] <DaveMethvin> cool, thanks
[13:13:53] <m_gol> we could get some of them into 3.1.0
[13:14:00] <m_gol> together with the ready fix
[13:14:13] <m_gol> s/fix/a feature/ ;)
