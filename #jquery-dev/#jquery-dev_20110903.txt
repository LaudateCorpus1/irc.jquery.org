[06:53:26] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from rem: @jquery need to point http://t.co/48s5DW6 to latest version, no? ★ http://bit.ly/nsGgct
[06:53:37] <matjas> http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js is still 1.6.2
[06:53:55] <miketaylr> D:
[10:29:16] <daleharvey> Hey, I posted this bug about deferreds a while ago, but its beginning to get on my nerves, should I attempt a patch / file a bug or is it expected behaviour? - http://jsfiddle.net/cVGHX/6/  (need to open your console)
[10:30:19] <daleharvey> basically the callback arguments are in an inconsistent format when you use $.when.apply(this, arrayOfDeffereds)
[10:42:36] <ajpiano> sounds like a bug to me
[10:42:40] <ajpiano> slash looks like one
[10:49:03] <daleharvey> cool, will take a look at patching, always wanted to dig around the jquery source
[12:49:05] <gnarf> I'm pretty sure that $.when with only one deferred doesn't wrap its arguments in an array
[12:49:10] <gnarf> daleharvey / ajpiano
[14:27:30] <rwaldron> matjas :P
[14:27:42] <rwaldron> protip: never listen to matjas. evern
[14:27:45] <rwaldron> ever*
[15:09:56] <mykul|Home> sorry about the flooding
[17:28:06] <darkh> i think i found a fix/workaround for a khtml bug. i used a css hook for "position" setting it temporarily to fixed. then i was able drag the dialog from jquery ui.
[17:37:51] <darkh> hm but it seems to break other things...
[19:00:16] <jaubourg> yop
[19:14:12] <jaubourg> hey DaveMethvin
[19:14:18] <DaveMethvin> hey jaubourg
[19:14:35] <jaubourg> so a 1.6.4 it is?
[19:14:39] <DaveMethvin> yeah looks like it
[19:14:43] <jaubourg> makes sense
[19:14:52] <DaveMethvin> i can't believe i landed that
[19:14:58] <jaubourg> happens
[19:15:08] <jaubourg> we're cursed with 1.x.3 or something
[19:15:32] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[19:15:51] <DaveMethvin> the pain is having to get all the cdns to update again...
[19:16:02] <DaveMethvin> maybe we can have them remove 1.6.3
[19:16:15] <DaveMethvin> since it will be out for less than a week i suspect
[19:16:25] <jaubourg> I have no clue if this would be feasible
[19:16:29] <DaveMethvin> monday is a holiday here so we are unlikely to get this out before tuesday
[19:16:40] <jaubourg> k
[19:16:57] <DaveMethvin> the next order of business is getting xhtml testing on the unit tests
[19:17:01] <DaveMethvin> :)
[19:17:26] <jaubourg> I'm to blame too, you know, I should have been more vigilant myself... I was surprised to see something like this land between RC and release but didn't ring the alarm
[19:17:50] <DaveMethvin> in retrospect i am not sure why i landed the damn thing
[19:17:57] <DaveMethvin> i was thinking it was low impact
[19:18:22] <DaveMethvin> but really anything in support.js is pretty far reaching
[19:18:29] <jaubourg> it's a guy with tatoos that made it, that's why... you probably thought the guy could be dangerous if you refused :P
[19:18:52] * jaubourg hides
[19:18:56] <DaveMethvin> lol
[19:19:19] <DaveMethvin> rick is prolly beating himself up too but he did about 80% of the patches for this release
[19:19:29] <jaubourg> we should probably transform index.html into index.php with options to test different doctypes
[19:19:32] <DaveMethvin> these were all suggestions from other ppl
[19:20:10] <jaubourg> I tell you what, I'm supposed to see Mathias this month, I'll slap him right when I see him :P
[19:20:25] <jaubourg> "that's from Dave!"
[19:20:26] <jaubourg> ;)
[19:20:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah he almost did another one after that
[19:20:42] <DaveMethvin> the one where it gets teh body element and he switched it to docuemnt.body
[19:20:54] <DaveMethvin> at least i caught that one
[19:20:58] <jaubourg> hehe
[19:21:19] <DaveMethvin> but if we were testing xhtml at least we'd know it broke
[19:21:29] <jaubourg> we need to document this stuff, like add a comment before the html string stating: "MUST BE PROPER XML"
[19:22:13] <jaubourg> does testswarm accept multiple test runs (like index.html AND index.xhtml for instance)?
[19:22:38] <DaveMethvin> i dunno ... i hope we can test things like this easily
[19:22:46] <DaveMethvin> otherwise i know we'll break something again
[19:23:03] <jaubourg> well, I'll point you to the many iframe tricks and specific test pages I added
[19:23:15] <jaubourg> test runs like we do have their limits
[19:23:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah they do
[19:23:44] <jaubourg> I really think it's a question of properly documenting stuff in the source itself
[19:23:44] <DaveMethvin> there are some delegate/mouseover tests but they require manual runs and interaction
[19:24:06] <DaveMethvin> yeah that definitely is important, a ticket number lets us see the discussion that led the the patch
[19:24:10] <DaveMethvin> without being too overly verboxe
[19:24:13] <DaveMethvin> verbose
[19:24:44] <jaubourg> I think, sometimes, verbose is ok
[19:24:55] <DaveMethvin> well any time you see me screwing up in the future, don't be shy about saying "hey dave you're screwing up!"
[19:25:36] <jaubourg> I should have said something but it's crazy times these days... and I still think our release schedule is a bit too ectic
[19:26:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i was kind of pushing 1.6.3 so we could get 1.7 going
[19:26:07] <DaveMethvin> of course now this slows it down further
[19:26:17] <DaveMethvin> but the real problem was that i landed something that wasn't critical
[19:26:23] <jaubourg> yeah, but 1.7 is supposed to be released when? the 12th or something?
[19:26:34] <DaveMethvin> the 12th is when we should have everything landed
[19:26:37] <jaubourg> heh
[19:26:43] <DaveMethvin> with the hopes we can release by the conference
[19:26:53] * jaubourg crosses fingers
[19:27:17] <DaveMethvin> well i know there will be more bugs, i have ripped events.js apart and glued it back together
[19:27:29] <DaveMethvin> so we can't rush the 1.7 release
[19:28:00] <jaubourg> I need to work on $.Callbacks and, of course, since I'll be away for all of October, that's when I have a shitload of work at the company
[19:28:15] <DaveMethvin> well then you'd better do it in September :)
[19:28:26] <jaubourg> (and that's when a potential gf show up too, of course)
[19:28:33] <DaveMethvin> i am going to be out in california for work from the 12th-16th
[19:28:48] <DaveMethvin> so I'll land everything and run away :P
[19:28:49] <jaubourg> oh, the work is in September, before I disapear for a month ;)
[19:29:03] <jaubourg> haha
[19:29:32] <jaubourg> // TODO: DaveMethvin: write the event code
[19:29:34] <jaubourg> here, done
[19:29:38] <jaubourg> now run
[19:29:42] <DaveMethvin> i have a few TODO: in there still
[19:30:04] <DaveMethvin> i made all the special cases that were hardwired into the code use the special events interface
[19:30:15] <jaubourg> \o/
[19:30:21] <DaveMethvin> but i still have a coupla bugs to iron out
[19:30:25] <DaveMethvin> nothing big i don't think
[19:30:36] <DaveMethvin> but you know how that it
[19:30:37] <DaveMethvin> is
[19:30:43] <jaubourg> yeah, but you cannot be sure
[19:30:52] <DaveMethvin> not until i get it all working
[19:30:58] <jaubourg> I know, I sweated on the ajax rewrite, I can tell you that
[19:31:18] <DaveMethvin> you are my inspiration for events :)
[19:31:26] <jaubourg> :)
[19:31:36] <DaveMethvin> i keep thinking if jaubourg rewrite ajax, events should be easy!
[19:31:39] <jaubourg> well, I'm happy that it's not damn easy to fix stuff in ajax now
[19:31:47] <jaubourg> not = so
[19:31:58] <jaubourg> oh the irony of the typo
[19:32:00] <DaveMethvin> i am hoping for the same in events
[19:32:39] <jaubourg> I'm eager to see what you did, never looked deeply into events, but it seemed damn convoluted to me last time I checked
[19:32:53] <DaveMethvin> there was a huge amount of redundancy in there, right now i am about 500 bytes shorter for the compressed code
[19:33:07] <jaubourg> woah, that's quite a lot
[19:33:29] <DaveMethvin> all the mouse hit detection was duplicated once for bind, and a separate set for delegated
[19:33:39] <jaubourg> I learned a lot when rewriting deferred for node-plus... I think I may have opportunities for size reduction in deferred beyond Callbacks
[19:34:04] <DaveMethvin> it would be a nice statement if we could make 1.7 shorter
[19:34:17] <jaubourg> I wouldn't hold my breath yet ;)
[19:34:36] <DaveMethvin> i am pretty sure the events stuff is faster, i pushed some event-time work to setup and teardown
[19:34:48] <jaubourg> what would be incredible if we could sneak pub/sub in at no cost
[19:35:07] <jaubourg> faster/smaller, nice
[19:35:08] <DaveMethvin> what was the outcome of that vote again?
[19:35:43] <jaubourg> I don't think it made it in... but I don't despair, especially given how easy and compact it is with Callbacks
[19:35:58] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7547
[19:36:25] <jaubourg> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.7/callbacks/src/topic.js
[19:36:34] <jaubourg> dojo compatible to boot
[19:36:38] <DaveMethvin> it wasn't that big to begin with, more a question of whether we were putting unrelated functionality into core
[19:37:40] <jaubourg> could be a good showcase for Callbacks imo. No event or stuff like that involved, pure callback list
[19:37:45] <DaveMethvin> definitely lower overhead than events
[19:38:34] <DaveMethvin> we still have some sticky situations with events that can't be fixed without breaking changes
[19:38:46] <jaubourg> how breaking?
[19:38:58] <DaveMethvin> like the fact that checkboxes have the "wrong" value when you trigger a manual click vs a user clicking
[19:39:11] <DaveMethvin> b/c when we trigger the click we fake the bubbling
[19:39:23] <DaveMethvin> ratehr than let the browser do it
[19:40:10] <DaveMethvin> for native things like click I'd prefer to make the browser do all the work, that would get us all the correct native functionality
[19:40:21] <gnarf> jaubourg: that gist is so sexy i want to kiss you
[19:40:23] <gnarf> just so you know
[19:40:29] * gnarf smiles and goes back to lurking
[19:40:30] <DaveMethvin> lol
[19:40:38] <jaubourg> gnarf: what gist?
[19:40:46] <DaveMethvin> shut up and take the kiss jaubourg
[19:40:46] <gnarf> topic
[19:40:51] <gnarf> sory, not gist
[19:40:55] <gnarf> file
[19:40:57] <gnarf> whatever
[19:40:58] <jaubourg> oh, it's a file in the branch ;)
[19:41:11] <jaubourg> but I'll take the kiss anyway
[19:42:01] <DaveMethvin> ok so this weekend i am gonna get some 1.7 stuff done and try to forget 1.6.4 until we can do something about it on tuesday
[19:42:17] <DaveMethvin> hey maybe gnarf can land a rAF fix in 1.6.4
[19:42:23] * DaveMethvin runs away
[19:42:27] <jaubourg> hahahaha
[19:42:37] <jaubourg> meany Dave
[19:43:00] <jaubourg> effects will be the big thing for 1.8 for sure
[19:43:24] <jaubourg> then it'll be time to think about 2.0
[19:43:25] <gnarf> i'd like to talk with everyone about their plans for 1.8 so i can give a quick summary of things to expect :)
[19:43:30] <DaveMethvin> yeah, around here we only break one major subsystem per version!
[19:43:37] <jaubourg> \o/
[19:43:53] <jaubourg> already broke ajax and support
[19:43:56] <DaveMethvin> oh and one major ball-crushing bug per minor version
[19:44:16] <jaubourg> biggest on a .3 minor
[19:44:27] <jaubourg> we hate the number 3
[19:44:29] <DaveMethvin> i think we have the pattern down pretty well now
[19:44:37] <DaveMethvin> the .2 is usually pretty good
[19:44:44] <jaubourg> that's called being organized ;)
[19:44:47] * gnarf laughs
[19:45:18] <jaubourg> btw, no meeting on monday then
[19:45:23] <jaubourg> because of hollidays?
[19:45:46] <DaveMethvin> prolly not, although i shoudl be around then so we could have an informal get-together if anyone is here
[19:45:46] <gnarf> damn holidays
[19:45:57] <gnarf> i say instead of meeting we all get shitty drunk
[19:46:00] <gnarf> and bitch about .3
[19:46:01] <jaubourg> bah, I'll probably be around
[19:46:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[19:46:25] <DaveMethvin> stupid xhtml
[19:46:28] <jaubourg> we can write 1.6.3 on pieces of paper and have a webcam happening where we all burn it :P
[19:46:29] <DaveMethvin> i never liked it anyway
[19:46:38] <DaveMethvin> i say we close that damned bug wontfix
[19:46:46] <gnarf> We can burn our effigies to 1.6.3 on google hangout
[19:47:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah we could do a hangout, that might be fun
[19:47:09] <jaubourg> the real question is how to tests for different doctypes
[19:47:22] <jaubourg> no clue what the good approach would be from a testswarm point of view
[19:47:52] <jaubourg> for this specific case, loading an iframe with all the source files in should be enough though
[19:48:06] <jaubourg> we could then add tests inside the iframe on a case per case basis
[19:48:16] <DaveMethvin> i just want to be sure we don't have a recurrence
[19:48:36] <jaubourg> going the usual support way should be enough then
[19:49:03] <jaubourg> (I'm glad I had this iframe testing stuff done generically)
[19:49:53] <DaveMethvin> i'm running off, have a good weekend everyone!
[19:50:06] <jaubourg> same to you Dave :)
[20:10:30] <Krinkle> I'm trying to understand why the quickExpr is still matching for <tag> at all. We've got the charAt(0) === '<' etc. check now, right ?
[20:10:48] <Krinkle> that happens before quickExpr is used and should be ok. If that doesn't match, it's an ID
[20:11:13] <Krinkle> quickExpr would only have to check if it starts with and #, then pass to document.getElementByid
[20:11:40] <Krinkle> Are there are cases were $() accepts HTML that doesn't start with < and ends with > ?
[20:11:50] <Krinkle> or rather, _should_ accept HTML *

[20:36:26] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by rwldrn (6h, 1m ago): Reverts broken support string. Fixes #10197
[20:37:10] <DaveMethvin> hey rwaldron
[20:37:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah i saw, thanks
[20:37:33] <DaveMethvin> can you add a comment with a ref to the ticket?
[20:37:40] <DaveMethvin> that way we don't regress on it
[20:37:42] <rwaldron> how about...
[20:37:50] <rwaldron> "protip: ignore matjas"
[20:37:57] <DaveMethvin> yeah, that too
[20:38:17] <DaveMethvin> is the rest of the patch okay?
[20:38:33] <DaveMethvin> it went back to "t" from &nbsp;
[20:39:06] <DaveMethvin> if we are at all unsure we should back it all out
[20:39:22] <rwaldron> yes, diego's advice was sound
[20:39:47] <rwaldron> he pointed out that the reason "t" was appearing in the viewport was because  -1000 is not a valid value for top/left
[20:39:54] <DaveMethvin> oh right
[20:39:56] <rwaldron> we needed to give it a unit
[20:39:57] <DaveMethvin> px
[20:40:01] <rwaldron> and make it a string
[20:40:03] <rwaldron> that was legit
[20:40:30] <rwaldron> changing the markup to be broken-ass HTML5 "willy-nilly" was the problem
[20:40:56] <rwaldron> TBH, that was the only part that I struggled agreeing to and I should've stuck with my gut
[20:41:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah i saw the change and was focused on the part with the px and pretty much ignored the important thing
[20:41:14] <rwaldron> but i decided that it was ok based on all the tests passing
[20:41:44] <DaveMethvin> well we need to make sure the tests break, as in testing with xhtml, i added a ticket for that
[20:41:58] <rwaldron> yeah
[20:42:06] <rwaldron> i saw that
[20:42:12] <rwaldron> but the doctype is already xhtml
[20:42:22] <DaveMethvin> well at least 1.6.4 will have that fix to .data as well
[20:42:26] <rwaldron> unless it needs to be some other doctype
[20:42:35] <rwaldron> or slight deviation
[20:42:48] <DaveMethvin> oh but it's not served up as the right type i bet
[20:42:51] <rwaldron> i definitely learned a lesson though
[20:43:01] <rwaldron> basically that guts are often talking for a reason
[20:43:21] <DaveMethvin> i shouldn't have landed that fix after rc1
[20:43:27] <DaveMethvin> it wasn't important enough
[20:43:35] <rwaldron> it seemed so trivial
[20:43:37] <DaveMethvin> esp with 1.7 coming relatively quickly
[20:43:39] <rwaldron> and we ALL tested
[20:43:41] <rwaldron> alot
[20:43:54] <rwaldron> i ran and re-ran in every browser that we support
[20:43:55] <DaveMethvin> just goes to show, nothing is trivial
[20:44:03] <rwaldron> yeah, exactly
[20:44:06] <rwaldron> lesson learned
[20:44:07] <rwaldron> :(
[20:44:28] <rwaldron> it was also frustrating because i was out with my buddy for most of the day
[20:44:47] <DaveMethvin> nothing we can really do until tuesday, since monday is a holiday
[20:44:51] <rwaldron> and meanwhile all i could think about was all of the users with broken ass applications
[20:45:06] <rwaldron> ugh
[20:45:21] <rwaldron> why the shit would anyone ever use that url in production code?
[20:45:26] <jaubourg> we still love you, rick
[20:45:27] <rwaldron> i dont understand people
[20:45:40] <rwaldron> that is so amatuer
[20:45:45] <DaveMethvin> letting people change the code on your page is asking for trouble
[20:45:53] <rwaldron> amateur*
[20:45:57] <DaveMethvin> i figured I'd cover that in the blog post announcing 1.6.4
[20:46:04] <rwaldron> good call
[20:46:07] <jaubourg> yeah, but you talk to the guy who forgot about file:// urls in his ajax rewrite
[20:46:09] <jaubourg> so meh
[20:46:10] <rwaldron> thanks jaubourg
[20:46:24] <rwaldron> dude
[20:46:28] <DaveMethvin> well here is the way i look at it
[20:46:36] <DaveMethvin> the people who break things are the people who do things
[20:46:43] <rwaldron> as far as I'm concerned file:// is not the web
[20:47:02] <jaubourg> but it's supported and I fucked up pretty badly on this one
[20:47:08] <rwaldron> I made it law that Popcorn.js is to be developed and tested via http at all times
[20:47:26] <rwaldron> some of the students were running the test suite from file:// and filing bugs
[20:47:31] <rwaldron> atrocious
[20:47:46] <jaubourg> and I'm not even talking about the background on the body element mess I created with support
[20:47:55] <DaveMethvin> since chrome is so popular its issues with file:// cause a lot of pain
[20:48:11] <DaveMethvin> let's not speak of the background on the body :P
[20:48:18] * jaubourg hides
[20:48:36] <rwaldron> I'm not sure if this is meant to be positive... "the people who break things are the people who do things"?
[20:48:43] <jaubourg> anyway, dangerously nearing 6am
[20:48:47] <jaubourg> gotta get some sleep
[20:48:48] <rwaldron> sounds like one of those revolutionary pieces of advice
[20:48:52] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's positive
[20:48:54] <rwaldron> jaubourg jesus.
[20:48:57] <rwaldron> go to bed
[20:48:59] <rwaldron> <3
[20:49:01] <jaubourg> about to
[20:49:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah i gotta go, only midnight here
[20:49:11] <DaveMethvin> but i am turning into a pumpkin soon
[20:49:11] <jaubourg> good night guys
[20:49:14] <DaveMethvin> gnight
[20:49:17] <rwaldron> i'm waiting for a piece of pie to warm up
[20:49:29] <rwaldron> anyway, good night
[20:49:33] <rwaldron> thanks DaveMethvin
[20:49:38] <rwaldron> i feel a bit better
