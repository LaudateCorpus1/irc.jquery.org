[06:22:56] <m_gol> or I'll just revert the commit, it's clearly wrong at this point, no doubt

[07:45:36] <b-ot> ajpiano: @yellowled: @jquery http://t.co/3gkXQxHGf3 still is 1.10.2. That can‚Äôt be right.
[07:45:49] <ajpiano> cc DaveMethvin gnarf
[07:45:53] <ajpiano> (jquery-latest.js) ^^
[07:45:55] <ajpiano> on our cdn
[07:47:00] <gnarf> http://codeorigin.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js?view it is
[07:49:14] <gnarf> "@yellowled @jquery It hasn't been updated yet, not sure if we will... latest shouldn't be used in production anyway. Point at 1.11.0 instead"
[07:49:29] <gnarf> i honestly think we should just freeze "latest" and be public about it
[07:49:56] <gnarf> ^^ i didn't actually send that response
[07:50:26] <gnarf> was gonna wait for DaveMethvin
[07:51:29] <gnarf> https://twitter.com/gnarf/status/431092667515023360 cc ajpiano 
[07:51:29] <b-ot> gnarf: @gnarf: @yellowled @jquery It hasn't been updated yet (not-automated). jquery-latest shouldn't be used in production anyway. Point at 1.11.0 instead
[07:52:02] <ajpiano> i think that'd be hella confusing
[07:52:14] <gnarf> https://twitter.com/gnarf/status/431092846381133824
[07:52:14] <b-ot> gnarf: @gnarf: @yellowled @jquery we automated like every release task (except update latest) - will probably get it fixed soon :)
[07:52:28] <ajpiano> also i think a lot of people aren't actually using latest as the cdn makes it seem
[07:52:45] <ajpiano> and that things like jsbin and jsfiddle and codepen inflate it a lot
[07:52:50] <DaveMethvin> ugh .. dunno how i missed that
[07:52:53] <ajpiano> that's just a pet theory though
[07:53:04] <DaveMethvin> we updated jquery.js and the min
[07:53:45] <DaveMethvin> we have too many places that we store the latest :/
[07:55:04] <gnarf> ajpiano: "a lot" can't be "that much" though, the people using jsbin/codepen/fiddle are a much smaller percentage of people than "those that browse the internet" -- seems unlikely that even high usage from 1% of the population is enough to skew the result more than 5-10%
[07:55:20] <gnarf> though really
[07:55:22] <gnarf> its impossible to know
[07:55:37] <DaveMethvin> gnarf:  can we get referrer info?
[07:55:41] <DaveMethvin> i guess not
[07:55:52] <gnarf> because it might be that the percentage of people using code.jquery.com is remarkably low, and that jsbin/codepen/fiddle are the highest because they have it by default
[07:56:13] <DaveMethvin> i don't think jsfiddle uses -latest
[07:56:19] <DaveMethvin> in fact it's way behind
[07:56:25] <DaveMethvin> it has -git and 1.9.1
[07:57:25] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: think of the number of bytes to store the referrer log from 700 million daily requests to code.jquery.com :)
[07:57:35] <gnarf> i doubt maxcdn records referrer
[07:57:41] <gnarf> but if they do, they would give us a report
[07:57:44] <DaveMethvin> hey it ain't MY disk space :)
[07:57:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah i doubt it too
[08:59:09] <m_gol> if we haven't updated jquery-latest yet, maybe let's just leave it on 1.10
[08:59:40] <m_gol> we shouldn't mention this URL anywhere except to actively discourage its use
[09:00:26] <m_gol> I was for freezing it at 1.11.x but if it stayed on 1.10.2, that works for me as well
[09:00:35] <m_gol> we can leave it as it is for now and decide in San Diego
[09:00:42] <m_gol> DaveMethvin gnarf ^^^
[09:01:54] <gnarf> m_gol: it's going to be very confusing. I don't think we can kill it until we kill 1.x
[09:02:00] <gnarf> i thought more about it
[09:02:01] <m_gol> Google did it
[09:02:11] <m_gol> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.js is frozen at 1.9.1
[09:02:43] <m_gol> and I haven't seen many souls confused about that ;)
[09:02:57] <gnarf> hrm
[09:03:00] <gnarf> compelling
[09:03:02] <gnarf> cc ajpiano ^
[09:03:34] <gnarf> m_gol: btw, i think stripping the polyfil out is a good idea, but will probably bump to 1.0 with it
[09:03:38] <gnarf> in the raf plugin
[09:04:02] <m_gol> sure
[09:04:34] <gnarf> could you add a note in the readme that it specifically should not be used with a requestAnimationFrame polyfill, nor should they expect to get one from the plugin?
[09:05:14] <m_gol> sure
[09:05:45] <m_gol> maybe sth advising to put the polyfill after the jQuery plugin is loaded so that it doesn't get applied here
[09:06:10] <m_gol> another option would be to just check if window.requestAnimationFrame is a native method
[09:06:14] <m_gol> by doing toString
[09:06:34] <m_gol> not sure how does that work for some older browsers atm but I know lodash does it
[09:07:07] <m_gol> that would require more bytes than just removing the polyfill but still not a lot and would remove this polyfill restriction
[09:07:48] <m_gol> saying people they have to load the polyfill themselves if they want to use it for anything else seems more clear than also advising them to not load the plugin after loading the polyfill
[09:07:55] <m_gol> gnarf: what do you think?
[09:14:31] <gnarf> more information about it in general (like why they shouldn't bother to polyfill before including this) will help :)
[09:15:05] <m_gol> I mean situations where they need a polyfill for some other code
[09:15:11] <m_gol> so they have to load it somewhere
[09:15:40] <m_gol> and unless we add this native method check if they mess up the order, the plugin will be applied although it shouldn't
[10:20:46] <rodrigobaron> hi
[10:27:32] <rodrigobaron> I want learn how jquery works and make contributions ... exists documents about code design  ?
[10:29:09] <rodrigobaron> or maybe read this book  http://jsninja.com ?
[13:02:32] <DaveMethvin> .
[13:23:31] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: that's an interesting point
