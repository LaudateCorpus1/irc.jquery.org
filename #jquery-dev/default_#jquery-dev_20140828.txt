[11:49:36] <DaveMethvin> and pointer events are right out
[11:50:10] <snover> they are going to say ‚Äúlook, we aren‚Äôt doing this without approval from others‚Äù while doing things without approval from others and then post-facto rationalising it by saying that they were just proposing a standard and apple provided the lukewarm commitment they need to fulfil their ‚Äúpolicy standard‚Äù

[12:15:16] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer leobalter Krinkle: This line in the "logs.js" tests poses much risk: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/3b06577863a5f8f07a2f27f5a21588df61f3e1ea/test/logs.js#L232
[12:15:28] <JamesMGreene> I think we need to split that out into a separate file
[12:15:57] <JamesMGreene> For the HTML Reporter, it clears all of the preceding tests' results
[12:16:39] <JamesMGreene> It could be equally devastating for other Reporters, depending on which logging callbacks they listen to
[12:17:12] <leobalter> I agree
[12:17:24] <Krinkle> isn't that deprecated/private?
[12:17:30] <leobalter> deprecated
[12:17:41] <Krinkle> sounds similar to the feature where one coudl re-open a closed test after it's done by adding extra assertions
[12:17:42] <JamesMGreene> Yes but the problem is invoking it there within a test suite
[12:17:46] <Krinkle> we removed that bug/feature too
[12:17:52] <leobalter>  to be removed on QUnit 2
[12:18:01] <JamesMGreene> I had test failures from my changes but the `init` blows them all away so that everything looked happy
[12:18:08] <Krinkle> yeah
[12:18:24] <Krinkle> we can keep the method until 2.x, but I'd be fine with it not being tested
[12:19:06] <Krinkle> If we want to asserts QUnit.config.stats we could do that at the beginning of a test suite
[12:19:09] <JamesMGreene> It's easy enough to test it, we just need it on a separate test page
[12:19:10] <Krinkle> assert
[12:19:17] <Krinkle> yeah
[12:21:01] <JamesMGreene> Actually
[12:21:21] <JamesMGreene> I can probably just rearrange the order of these tests
[12:46:58] <JamesMGreene> Never mind... `init` is even more devastating than I thought because it also drops the queue
[12:47:30] <JamesMGreene> Its test definitely needs to be moved
[12:57:35] <leobalter> as it is deprecated, it's fine to move it to another file, it will be removed soon anyway
[12:57:55] <leobalter> soon = the day QUnit 2 lands
[13:03:35] <jzaefferer> Some time in the unforeseeable future

[14:56:29] <ganchenkor> Hi guys. Do you mind if I ask a question here: Basically, I use Marionette framework. It does have Regions to manage Views. I use Backbone.Router and I disabled linkBinding,hashListinng, pushState in JQM 1.4.3. The problem is when I show a region having JQM template. pagecontainer removes completely. I was trying to init it by call: $('body').pagecontainer() - but it doesn't seem to work, so I could changePage after. If I don't use regions, and just pl
[14:56:29] <ganchenkor> Do you know if I can reinitialize pageContainer? and How? After I call region.show(view) - $(":mobile-pagecontainer") - is empty
[14:56:29] <ganchenkor> any calls after will trigger an error saying that my pagecontainer is not initialized
[14:57:51] <snover> ganchenkor: this is the channel for development of the jquery library, the support chat is at #jquery
[15:04:35] <ganchenkor> Ok. sorry about that
[15:12:23] <ganchenkor> nvm i got it working
