[12:23:23] <paul_irish> ajpiano: is jquery foundation a IRS certified 501(c)(3) organization ?
[12:28:41] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: 501(c)(6)
[12:28:49] <paul_irish> oh!
[12:28:59] <paul_irish> did we seek 3?
[12:29:10] <paul_irish> just saw the articles about how its nearly impossible for open soruce to get 3
[12:29:13] <gnarf> paul_irish: no
[12:29:19] <gnarf> paul_irish: because of that ^ 
[12:29:20] <gnarf> also
[12:29:32] <scott_gonzalez> No, but Joel is working with an OSS project that's seeking 501(c)(3) right now.
[12:29:47] <gnarf> if you read the requirements for (c)(6) vs (c)(3) - we actually make more sense as a (c)(6) i think
[13:06:48] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez: what project?
[13:08:21] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: Not sure. I don't think he ever mentioned the name in our discussions.
[13:08:38] <paul_irish> kk np
[13:09:04] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: He's @hackercounsel on Twitter if you want to ask.
[13:09:16] <paul_irish> ah right. yes, gracias.
