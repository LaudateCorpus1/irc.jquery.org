[09:01:46] <jaubourg> no meeting ?
[09:16:05] <robertmaxrees> wrong channel for that.
[09:16:58] <robertmaxrees> jaubourg check out #jquery-meeting
[09:17:43] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: FYI, he posted this in here because jquery-meeting is muted when no meeting is going on
[09:17:59] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: The meeting just started 2 minutes later
[09:18:01] <robertmaxrees> did the meeting start late?
[09:18:06] <robertmaxrees> aaaah hahaha - of course :)
[09:56:28] <arthurvr> Btw, m_gol isn‚Äôt in the ‚Äùattending:‚Äù part of the meeting minutes yet
[09:56:46] <arthurvr> thanks, m_gol 
[09:56:48] <DaveMethvin> got him now
[09:58:34] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I forgot - we still have the .data patch hanging around: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1905
[09:58:39] <m_gol> the last PR against 1.x-master
[09:59:06] <DaveMethvin> oh right, that should land too
[09:59:48] <arthurvr> m_gol: You wasn‚Äôt in the one of previous meeting too ;-)
[10:00:21] <DaveMethvin> that PR looks okay to me, any reason NOT to land it?
[10:02:18] <m_gol> we're missing an issue for that, right?
[10:03:01] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: it's just a PR
[10:04:27] <gibson0421> it will almost certainly be changed again for https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1751#issuecomment-67721150 , possibly including the assertions
[10:05:02] <gibson0421> but per the other tickets we discussed today, this looks good for now with more ambitious work to follow
[10:08:13] <m_gol> gibson0421: I wonder since that issue affects master as well and data impl there is different
[10:09:01] <gibson0421> but compat and master _should_ come together
[10:11:17] <m_gol> gibson0421: right, so we can land it but it'll require different changes on `master` (that we don't have a PR for) and we're going to change it again soon as you said
[10:15:52] <gibson0421> yep
[10:25:01] <m_gol> gibson0421 DaveMethvin: there still would be some tweaks required (like not prepending to body in a test) and we'd need a separate patch for master; do we want it? we didn't tell the patch author about the planned changes and he did some modifications to his PR over time
[10:26:48] <gibson0421> hmmm
[10:26:59] <gibson0421> has rwaldron committed to the larger work?
[10:27:45] <gibson0421> if not, we could open it up to the gh-1905 submitter (e.g., "We can land this as-is after the following small tweaks, but it's likely to change soon. Would you like to take on the bigger .data changes?")
[10:28:11] <m_gol> ok, but we need a patch for master as well then
[10:28:25] <gibson0421> sure
[10:29:00] <m_gol> the issue is assigned to rwaldron so we need to check with him
[10:29:59] <m_gol> meh, totally forgot about our data plans when commenting and this patch actually goes in the opposite direction than planned ones
[10:30:12] <gibson0421> we all forgot
[10:31:06] <gibson0421> it was big for a while, and then fell off the radar
[10:31:14] <m_gol> ok, I think what you propose is reasonable; it'd be bad to tell the person "sorry for wasting your time, we forgot about the bigger change; CLOSED"
[10:32:16] <DaveMethvin> sorry i had to run  ... back shortly

[13:12:59] <b-ot> rwaldron: Type "b-ot help [topic]" for detailed help on a topic. Available topics are jQuery API, Seen, Tell, caniuse, Flip, Google, 8ball, Factoid.
[13:13:12] <rwaldron> b-ot help message
[13:13:19] <rwaldron> b-ot help tell
[13:13:20] <b-ot> rwaldron: Leave a message for someone with "!tell [nick] [message]". Read a message "!read". 
[13:15:13] <rwaldron> !tell gibson042 yes, I can do that work: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1751#issuecomment-67721150 
[13:15:13] <b-ot> rwaldron: I‚Äôll tell gibson042 about that.
[13:16:30] <rwaldron> !tell gibson042 but I'm not going to do anything until this is lands: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1428 (that shouldn't be read as me being sassy, I'm just saying that as a matter of course)
[13:16:30] <b-ot> rwaldron: I‚Äôll tell gibson042 about that.
[13:16:55] <rwaldron> !tell gibson042 and this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1668
[13:16:56] <b-ot> rwaldron: I‚Äôll tell gibson042 about that.
[13:17:09] <rwaldron> ping me when you're back
[15:21:45] <snover> scott_gonzalez: I try to get out‚Ä¶AND THEY KEEP PULLING ME BACK IN
[15:21:46] <snover> :)
[15:22:58] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[15:23:15] <scott_gonzalez> GitHub won't allow you to assign issues to someone that's not in the org :-P
[15:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> Why can't I assign issues to random developers? How else is open source supposed to work?!?
[15:24:08] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[15:24:24] <scott_gonzalez> I thought we were just supposed to find people who were active on GitHub and assign all of our issues to them...
[15:24:41] <robertmaxrees> wait, this sounds like one of those "job" things.
