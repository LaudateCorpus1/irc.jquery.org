[08:02:21] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: were you looking for me yesterday?
[13:00:37] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: yeah, nothing important but ping me if you're here :)
[13:00:55] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: ping!
[13:00:59] <m_gol> hah
[13:01:05] <m_gol> I was looking at our issue template
[13:01:46] <m_gol> and it looks a little clumsy, there are spaces between ** which makes it not render as bold in Markdow
[13:01:47] <m_gol> n
[13:02:04] <m_gol> I'd just make them proper headers as in PR template
[13:02:08] <DaveMethvin> it can definitely be improved, also kind of disappointing to see the misguided people still get through 
[13:02:13] <DaveMethvin> feel free to improve
[13:02:17] <DaveMethvin> it was just a start
[13:02:48] <m_gol> compare https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md to https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
[13:03:02] <m_gol> btw, the spacing is broken in "** Description**"
[13:03:10] <m_gol> can I turn them into headers?
[13:03:23] <DaveMethvin> sure! really, update to your heart's delight
[13:04:15] <m_gol> I wonder why people are still not reading it
[13:04:32] <DaveMethvin> because they're people
[13:04:35] <DaveMethvin> :)
[13:14:47] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: just replied on that Firefox email, there was a question in there that you can best answer
[13:17:16] <m_gol> I'll have a look

[14:05:05] <doesallmagic2> markelog: Events: don't execute native stop(Immediate)Propagation from simulation
[14:08:17] <DaveMethvin> markelog: timmywil i think we do
[14:08:29] <DaveMethvin> since it was a regression in those
[14:09:03] <timmywil> agreed
[14:09:20] <timmywil> I thought the milestone was 1.x/2.x
[14:10:03] <timmywil> ah, you changed it. Yea, I was thinking of it as 2.x first.
[15:17:16] <markelog> need to make some adjustments for 1.x
[15:17:28] <markelog> before though, it was marked as 2.x-only
[15:17:39] <markelog> will do cherry-pick from master
[15:18:00] <markelog> should it go to 1.x?
[15:25:51] <markelog> okay, pushed to 2.2-stable
[15:26:01] <markelog> ping me up if we want it in 1.x branch
