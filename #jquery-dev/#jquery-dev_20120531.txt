[02:42:07] <gibson042> .
[07:37:30] <DaveMethvin> .
[07:37:45] <DaveMethvin> bot-t you are fired
[07:39:01] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: you have one new message from bot-t: "Enjoying vacation in hawaii, thanks for firing me"
[07:39:24] <DaveMethvin> you just can't motivate a bot, i see
[07:39:37] <DaveMethvin> ircjsbot: tell bot-t he is fired
[07:39:37] <ircjsbot> DaveMethvin, OK, I will tell bot-t if I see them.
[07:41:08] <gnarf> ircjsbot: tell bot-t tell DaveMethvin that vacation time is appreciated
[07:41:08] <ircjsbot> gnarf, OK, I will tell bot-t if I see them.
[07:41:25] <DaveMethvin> whooa
[07:41:49] <gnarf> *shrug*
[07:41:56] <gnarf> might be fun when that one fires off :)\
[07:42:18] <gnarf> doubtfut tho
[07:42:30] <timmywil> won't it start with DaveMethvin says or something?
[07:42:44] <gnarf> ircjsbot probably says something like "One new message
[07:42:50] <DaveMethvin>  "ok bots, talk amongst yourselves, we will be back later"
[07:42:54] <timmywil> that would be fun tho
[07:43:13] <DaveMethvin> ok imma land some of the stuff in the pull q
[07:43:23] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: we missed you on the call yesterday :/
[07:43:32] <DaveMethvin> yeah did you have a good time?
[07:43:51] <DaveMethvin> didn't let them talk you into all their UI and Mobile pet projects did you :D
[07:44:02] <DaveMethvin> that scott_gonzalez can be mighty persuasive
[07:44:03] <timmywil> I logged on late, sorry I missed it as well :(
[07:45:12] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[07:45:27] <scott_gonzalez> For now I would just like to have servers up and running tomorrow :-P
[07:52:54] <danheberden> gnarf so in the event that (mt) can't help us, i think moving the affected services to a 8gig ve and letting them exist there for a bit is the best idea
[07:52:58] <danheberden> agree?
[08:07:26] <rtgibbons> danheberden: I'll be in and out of meetings today, but I can be on after 8ish Mountain Time to help out if needed
[08:07:46] <gnarf> danheberden: yeah
[08:08:02] <gnarf> danheberden: make a similar cron, fix it to be grunt instead of make
[08:08:15] <gnarf> danheberden: put it on one of the staging servers
[08:08:16] <danheberden> while they are decomissioning the boxes, the other email says that they are also auto upgrading some
[08:08:18] <danheberden> so i'm not sure what's up
[08:08:32] <danheberden> gnarf the staging servers are just 2gig be's
[08:08:34] <gnarf> danheberden: there was chatter overnight from Corey
[08:09:08] <gnarf> danheberden: some aren't doing ANYTHING right now and its a temporary hold out?
[08:09:17] <gnarf> check the infra issue
[08:09:24] <gnarf> im thinking jenkins is the right place for this
[08:09:43] <gnarf> in the end
[08:11:33] <danheberden> *ve's
[08:11:33] <danheberden> i think we'll need an 8 for api.jquery.com,blog.jquery.com, and jquery.com
[08:11:33] <danheberden> rtgibbons awesome dude

[10:34:15] <scott_gonzalez> IE6 isn't stacking up, it's winding down :-P
[10:34:21] <scott_gonzalez> Everything else has already caught up.
[10:39:03] <scott_gonzalez> The weekend should give IE6/7 some time to catch up :-)

[11:05:22] <ajpiano> gho5t: Dave Methvin is the lead for dev on jQuery core now
[11:05:42] <ajpiano> but JohnResi1 is still here right now :p
[11:05:46] <gho5t> oh i see
[11:06:03] <gho5t> i just found out i went to the same college as John at the same time

[11:20:23] <rwaldron> gho5t he lives in Boston, MA
[11:20:33] <rwaldron> but I tihnk he's travelling the world for the next month
[11:20:36] <rwaldron> or something like that
[11:20:51] <gho5t> ah
[11:37:35] <kswedberg> hey rwaldron, did we agree to change all references to type="Map" in API docs to type="PlainObject"?
[12:01:19] <rwaldron> kswedberg yep
[12:01:34] <rwaldron> the rationale being "that's what they are"
[12:01:48] <rwaldron> and that Map would become confusing in the near future
[12:01:56] <rwaldron> since Map will be an actual thing
[12:01:56] <kswedberg> ok, cool. thought so. :) just wanted to make sure before I made a huge commit to the repo.
[12:02:04] <kswedberg> right on.
[12:02:07] <rwaldron> yay!
[12:02:09] <kswedberg> thx, man.
[12:02:18] <gho5t> kswedberg in the house
[12:02:21] <rwaldron> glad we're getting that done ahead of time :)
[12:02:35] <kswedberg> yeah. me too.
[12:02:41] <kswedberg> hi gho5t. :)
[12:02:49] <gho5t> Hey! I've read your comments on api.jquery.com
[12:02:52] <gho5t> : )
[12:03:10] <gho5t> do you guys get paid to dev on jQuery?
[12:03:38] <kswedberg> for the most part, no.
[12:04:14] <danheberden> we get free nightmares though
[12:04:18] <gho5t> haha
[12:04:58] <gho5t> maybe i should join
[12:05:01] <kswedberg> and we get free hugs from danheberden, which is worth much more than any amount of money.
[12:05:01] <gho5t> good for the resume
[12:05:07] <gho5t> and might help me master this beat
[12:05:10] <gho5t> *beast
[12:05:24] <gho5t> are their requirements
[12:05:27] <gho5t> *there
[12:05:31] <gho5t> like good grammar
[12:05:36] <danheberden> *note: i get ass-grabby on my hugs
[12:05:50] <gho5t> i'm into that
[12:06:08] <gho5t> how would someone get started? just go in and pickup a bug?

[12:28:24] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on api.jquery.com by kswedberg (5m, 28s ago): Update arg names, types for accuracy, consistency  * Change type="Map" to type="PlainObject"  * Change name="events-map" to name="events" * Change name="eventTypes" to name="events"
[14:33:16] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: thx
[14:53:27] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: Can you confirm? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/02dd7c570bf4dbbdfc168f4352d04c667447be5d#commitcomment-1401174
[14:53:27] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by rwldrn (2d, 5h ago): jQuery#addBack supports an optional selector that can be used to filter the prior set before adding it back. Fixes #9800
[14:53:37] <scott_gonzalez> compare_size doesn't seem to be working properly for me
[15:14:19] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez I have a two bytes improvement
[15:14:24] <rwaldron> when do this..
[15:14:34] <rwaldron> return this.add( selector == null ?
[15:14:34] <rwaldron>       this.prevObject : this.prevObject.filter(selector)
[15:14:34] <rwaldron>     );
[15:14:42] <scott_gonzalez> That's what I thought :-)
[15:14:45] <rwaldron> is it worth it?
[15:14:51] <rwaldron> for readability?
[15:14:55] <rwaldron> maintainability?
[15:15:03] <scott_gonzalez> It's not exactly unreadable.
[15:15:05] <rwaldron> If you think so, I will take your word
[15:15:39] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think it's more readable either way actually.
[15:15:44] <scott_gonzalez> I think they're equally readable.
[15:16:16] <rwaldron> dunzo
[15:16:21] <rwaldron> ahem
[15:16:24] <rwaldron> where is the bot?

[17:46:03] <Krinkle> Did I miss it? Or did it not happen
[17:46:24] <Krinkle> johnbender: scott_gonzalez
[17:46:47] <scott_gonzalez> It happened.
[17:47:11] <Krinkle> What channel

[17:48:39] <Krinkle> Oh.. I understand what happened now
[17:48:43] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: pinged me at 5pm
[17:48:46] <Krinkle> I disconnected at 6pm
[17:48:50] <Krinkle> I got back in at 11pm
[17:49:03] <Krinkle> that's when I read it as  "new" message and thanked him for the notification and went to -meeting
[17:49:06] <Krinkle> which was emptuy
[17:49:07] <Krinkle> I
[17:49:15] <Krinkle> I didn't catch anything from the meeting in my clinet
[17:49:15] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[17:49:29] <Krinkle> :D
[17:49:51] <Krinkle> fortunately we have pretty logs
[18:28:25] <scott_gonzalez> Is there a sane way to generate a changelog when you're got a master and stable branch?
[18:28:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'm thinking no.
[18:31:03] <scott_gonzalez> yikes:
[18:31:05] <scott_gonzalez> jquery-ui (master %) $ git log 1.8... --pretty=format:"%H" | wc -l
[18:31:05] <scott_gonzalez>     2193
[18:31:58] <scott_gonzalez> That's like 50% of our git history...
