[05:52:24] <jqcommit> [testswarm/master] run.js "Querying for more tests" -> "Querying for tests". - Krinkle
[05:52:49] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: are you working on anything testswarm right now?
[05:53:00] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: Not now, nope
[05:53:10] <Krinkle> I'd like to get rid of the old /actions/ include, in other words, convert the last one last, addjob
[05:53:31] <jzaefferer> Okay
[05:53:56] <jzaefferer> I never ever used the html form to submit jobs, so was wondering if we could just drop the markup...
[05:54:24] <Krinkle> and then redo getneeded as OnlinestatsAction
[05:54:39] <Krinkle> addjob works even as it is right now
[05:54:47] <Krinkle> just doesn't have any css
[05:55:09] <Krinkle> I use it when working locally, I can go to ./addjob and tab into the areas and let Chrome autocomplete them
[05:55:12] <Krinkle> easy testing :)
[05:55:21] <Krinkle> sure I could do it from command line, but no reason to drop it
[05:55:26] <Krinkle> Not much work either
[05:55:57] <Krinkle> It does mean that addjob is going to require a POST again, we can change that if needed but I'd rather not unless we have to
[05:56:08] <Krinkle> can you try check up on Jenkins if it can handle it after all maybe?

[06:09:09] <jqcommit> [testswarm/master] (issue #130) Remove references to the Google Group "TestSwarm" - Krinkle
[06:24:02] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: Yeah, we'll update Jenkins anyway, use the new API, so requiring POST should be fine
[06:24:11] <Krinkle> ok
[06:24:21] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: GetneededPage?
[06:24:28] <Krinkle> hm.. I assume you c^
[06:24:36] <Krinkle> ah, only in the commit-msg
[06:24:46] <jzaefferer> What?
[06:24:55] <Krinkle> GetneededAction :)
[06:25:09] <jzaefferer> Oh
[06:25:26] <jzaefferer> my bad
[06:25:46] <jzaefferer> I'll leave that other readme PR to you
[09:01:52] <DaveMethvin> meetin time!
[09:04:32] <gnarf> YAY!
[09:04:37] <gnarf> I'm awake for one!

[09:50:58] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jqueryui: We're still looking for proposals for the SF jQuery Conference in June. Built something awesome with UI? Talk about it: http://t.co/m87HGQ0l ★ http://bit.ly/HffcQK
[11:14:33] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I took a look at that Sizzle PR. Did we make a decision on advanced closure for jQuery core?
[11:15:04] <timmywil> technically, the PR is not ideal, but I'm fine with it for the sake of ACC if we are going that route
[11:15:07] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: i was waiting for the build system to land for 1.8 before putting in closure stuff
[11:16:18] <DaveMethvin> i didn't look at the pr yet, still tryna get all my todos done from the meeting :)
[11:19:10] <danzik17> fyi - the link on jquery.com to the bug tracker is broken.....it's pointing to dev.jquery.com ( which seems to be down ) rather than http://bugs.jquery.com
[11:35:12] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: do you have full admin on github.com/jquery? I don't think I do, which may be preventing me from creating a new branch
[11:38:19] <scott_gonzalez> s/branch/repo/ ?
[11:38:50] <scott_gonzalez> I'm an owner.
[11:39:35] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Now you are too!
[11:39:42] <DaveMethvin> sweet, thanks!
[11:40:22] <scott_gonzalez> I see how it is. He uses me for increased privs then ditches me.
[13:50:40] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Do you know if the only reason core uses smarttabs for jshint is to support multi-line comments?
[13:50:58] <gnarf> no idea
[13:50:59] <scott_gonzalez> I can't think of any other time that we allow spaces for alignment at the beginning of a line.
[13:51:22] <scott_gonzalez> Rick and Dave aren't here to ask :-(
[14:04:44] <scott_gonzalez> Is there a reason we still do (function() {})() with the parens on the outside?
[14:31:57] <scott_gonzalez> Shouldn't we be using onevar?
[14:32:45] <gnarf> probably
[14:33:52] <scott_gonzalez> Fixing all of these lint errors is oh so fun.
[14:34:12] <scott_gonzalez> But it's admittedly better than me manually scanning every line.
[14:34:32] <scott_gonzalez> Apparently more accurate too :-P
