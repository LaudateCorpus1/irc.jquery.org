[05:18:42] <ne14u> i have questions about jquery documentation page, and i'm looking for someone who have permissions on wiki
[05:29:24] <ne14u> i translated http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries this article, but i cannot edit this page, because seems its protected now. I am looking for someone to reopen that page for edit or edit it for me. I searched a page like http://codex.wordpress.org/Documentation_team this one to see all team members and reach them, but i didnt found. Then now i am here. Anyone could
[05:29:25] <ne14u> help?
[05:40:43] <DaveMethvin> ne14u: everything at docs.jquery.com is obsolete, we're not using the wiki anymore
[05:40:55] <DaveMethvin> we're in the process of transitioning to new servers
[05:41:08] <DaveMethvin> api.jquery.com is up to date
[05:41:15] <DaveMethvin> but there will be a new learn.jquery.com
[05:41:21] <DaveMethvin> should be live by the end of the month
[05:42:08] <DaveMethvin> if you're interested in doing docs, we could use some help tho
[05:42:34] <DaveMethvin> ( /cc ajpiano ^)
[05:43:23] <DaveMethvin> ne14u: there is a #jquery-content channel, it seems quiet right now but that would be the best place to ask
[05:52:36] <ne14u> now i'm back, thank you for informations DaveMethvin

[20:37:31] <zap_> hi
[20:39:07] <rwaldron> gibson042 yo
[20:39:12] <rwaldron> why did you do that?
[20:39:39] <rwaldron> I wanted the OP to work through it and see what I was trying to show them
[20:39:54] <rwaldron> i could've just committed my branch
[20:45:04] <gibson042> huh? I didn't commit; just wanted maranomynet to see that a workaround for display:none body too (which seemed important to him) w/o exces computation
[20:46:13] <zap_> display: none or display: inline-block?
[20:48:31] <gibson042> zap_: display:none; Firefox gives bad answers for computed display of elements in a hidden iframe
[20:49:10] <rwaldron> oh gawwwwf
[20:49:23] <zap_> oh!...
[20:49:27] <rwaldron> for some reason, I completely missed that this was on your repo
[20:49:31] <rwaldron> gibson042 ^
[20:49:53] <rwaldron> when i rec'd the email about it, i just sort of naturally assumed it was jquery/jquery
[20:50:12] <gibson042> ah, gotcha
[20:50:19] <rwaldron> fuck, sorry about that
[20:50:24] <rwaldron> its late
[20:50:27] <rwaldron> :|
[20:50:34] <rwaldron> ignore me
[20:50:52] <gibson042> nope... just trying to invite the OP to patch up the PR for another contributer
[20:50:55] <gibson042> no problem
[20:51:12] <rwaldron> word
[20:51:39] <rwaldron> gibson042 did you see the other?
[20:51:43] <rwaldron> 1033
[20:51:47] <rwaldron> manipulation stuff
[20:51:53] <zap_> I wonder if there is any way to toggle backface-visibility in chrome. The property works well in FF and suffers in Chrome :(
[20:52:02] <rwaldron> the ticket is a million years old.
[20:52:03] <gibson042> yeah, I was contemplating commenting on that tonight
[20:52:23] <pbramos> I think that's my fix
[20:52:27] <gibson042> pbramos was specifically looking for a ticket to work on
[20:52:32] <gibson042> hey there :)
[20:52:34] <rwaldron> pbramos yo
[20:52:37] <pbramos> yo!
[20:53:40] <rwaldron> that ticket has been just kicked around for 4 years
[20:53:45] <rwaldron> incredible
[20:54:22] <rwaldron> oh no, i have to go
[20:54:23] <rwaldron> eek
[20:54:39] <rwaldron> g'night gibson042 and sorry for the chaos
[20:54:47] <gibson042> np
[20:54:49] <gibson042> goodnight
[21:05:36] <gibson042> pbramos I'm going to try commenting on your PR tonight, but thanks so much for making it
[21:05:46] <gibson042> it's really promising
[21:06:33] <pbramos> Sweet.  No problem.  Hope it gets accepted ;0
[21:07:25] <snover> whatâ€™s this 4 year old ticket?
[21:07:35] <pbramos> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4087
[21:07:50] <snover> hahaha. neat.
