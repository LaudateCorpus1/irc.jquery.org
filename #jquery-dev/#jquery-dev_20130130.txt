[05:10:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: might wanna mention this change in the changelog for 1.10: https://gist.github.com/108038dfd5e7234ca23c 
[08:19:28] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: approximate ETA for 1.9.1?
[08:20:30] <scott_gonzalez> Trying to figure out how far behind UI will be ;-)
[08:33:55] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: not sure, i had hoped tomorrow but there's still a lot to do
[08:34:10] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[08:34:21] <scott_gonzalez> We've still got a bit to do ourselves.
[08:35:25] <scott_gonzalez> Well, all of our regressions are fixed, but there's more I'd ike to land.
[08:35:46] <DaveMethvin> all of our regressions are landed i think :D
[08:35:58] <DaveMethvin> i like to get those in first
[08:36:20] <DaveMethvin> oh you mean regression FIXES
[08:36:26] <DaveMethvin> haven't gotten all those yet
[08:36:38] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[08:46:42] <gnarf> heh
[09:42:57] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle|detached: when you're around i could use some help with a jQuery Migrate ci setup
[09:43:16] <DaveMethvin> i have the task there but am not sure of some of the testswarm plumbing that comes off an invisible json file
[09:44:03] <gnarf> mikesherov: RE https://github.com/mikesherov/jquery/commit/ecf5b77a61d8959de81e4c95ca32eaa1b8d37a04 -- did that unit land in master?
[09:44:03] <b-ot> gnarf: Mike Sherov (2w 13h ago): Fixes #13183: Wrong animation  initial value calculation (1.9.0rc1)
[09:44:03] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/commit/d4451ca65cf545e49e264e92df3fe5cea0a96336
[09:44:08] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: Dave Methvin (2d 16h ago): Initial commit of a testswarm task.
[09:44:47] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: we install those json's manually
[09:44:50] <gnarf> on jq02
[09:44:51] <gnarf> er jq03
[09:45:10] <DaveMethvin> ok that explains why i can't find it gnarf :D
[09:45:24] <DaveMethvin> of course atm i can't find my jenkins job either
[09:45:59] <DaveMethvin> ah there it is http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/view/All/job/jQuery%20Migrate%20Core%201.x/
[09:47:54] <gnarf> cc jzaefferer ^^^ do you know what we need to do to make a jquerymigrate user?
[09:48:13] <DaveMethvin> do i need a new user? or just a new job?
[09:48:27] <gnarf> new user on swarm to setup a page for that job
[09:49:14] <gnarf> and then an authToken for em
[09:49:39] <DaveMethvin> gnarf that mikesherov commit landed after 1.9.0 released: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/65df32dc21dc315fe0dcccdcf7d07884f4794ccd
[09:49:39] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: Mike Sherov (2w 13h ago): Fix #13183: Wrong animation initial value calc. Close gh-1136.
[09:50:29] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: the JSON looks like this: https://gist.github.com/23733e37653eb4f8530f
[09:50:46] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: yeah, but the unit test change didn't land in master did it?
[09:51:14] <DaveMethvin> looks like it did???
[09:51:32] <jzaefferer> gnarf DaveMethvin: register a regular user, then look up the authToken in the MySQL database, then put that into the config json passed to grunt from Jenkins. Yeah....
[09:51:44] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: sigh - forgot to pull
[09:51:45] <gnarf> lol
[09:52:06] <gnarf> jzaefferer: any chance you can help DaveMethvin finish this one off? :)
[09:52:06] <DaveMethvin> whew, my trust in git is unshaken :)
[09:52:37] <jzaefferer> yeah, lemme do the manual steps, then you just need to update/run the Jenkins job
[09:52:53] <DaveMethvin> ok, standing by ... thanks!
[09:53:09] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: Also, I just noticed you aren't in puppet
[09:53:15] <gnarf> pm me your SSH key ?
[09:53:50] <DaveMethvin> k just a sec
[09:56:45] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: okay, jquerymigrate should be good to go
[09:56:48] <jzaefferer> http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquerymigrate
[09:56:57] <jzaefferer> use that as the key in your testswarm task

[10:30:45] <gnarf> hrm
[10:31:25] <DaveMethvin> couldn't find grunt
[10:31:29] <DaveMethvin> lemme check the deps
[10:32:26] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: try just "grunt" in your job? instead of ./node_modules/.bin/grunt
[10:33:57] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: i have no idea where that is coming from
[10:34:05] <gnarf> in the job config in jenkins
[10:34:14] <gnarf> i just did an npm install -g grunt-cli there
[10:34:42] <DaveMethvin> oh, i copied that job from jquery core and figured the cmd would be the same

[10:44:49] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: try again
[10:44:55] <gnarf> chowned the -git file to jenkins uses
[10:44:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's running now
[10:45:03] <DaveMethvin> i just commented tht out for now
[10:45:05] <DaveMethvin> but i can put it back
[10:45:09] <gnarf> yeah, put it back
[10:45:12] <gnarf> jenkins can write there
[10:45:14] <gnarf> just didn't own the file
[10:45:40] <gnarf> might wanna copy the .min.js too
[10:46:58] <DaveMethvin> this job is taking entirely too long to run
[10:49:24] <DaveMethvin> oh my urls are bad
[10:49:27] <DaveMethvin> :)
[10:49:30] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: http://cl.ly/image/080g1Q0Z0e0Q
[10:49:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah just figured that out
[10:50:00] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Migrate Core 1.x build #7: ABORTED in 5 min 32 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Migrate%20Core%201.x/7/
[10:50:11] <DaveMethvin> yeah take that
[10:50:20] <gnarf> jzaefferer: did you make the jquerymigrate user?
[10:50:29] <gnarf> or was that DaveMethvin
[10:50:37] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer made it
[10:50:45] <DaveMethvin> everything seems to be set up now
[10:50:56] <DaveMethvin> i am forcing it to be a different browserset in the job atm
[10:50:57] <gnarf> his password is different from the other jquery users
[10:51:01] <gnarf> so i can't delete the job
[10:51:23] <gnarf> i could prolly fix that in mysql
[10:52:04] <DaveMethvin> so you want to delete the job? It seems to let me do that through the ui
[10:53:22] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquerymigrate on this?
[10:53:28] <gnarf> cuz swarm is gonna be stuck on it for a bit
[10:54:16] <DaveMethvin> i guess aborting the job did no good
[10:54:50] <gnarf> deleted it
[10:55:04] <gnarf> i just hacked the user table in mysql to change the password
[10:55:36] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: ready for another attempt whenever :)
[10:55:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah i just have to get the gruntfile straightened out 
[11:04:23] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Migrate Core 1.x build #8: ABORTED in 1 min 11 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Migrate%20Core%201.x/8/
[11:04:24] <doesallmagic> * dave.methvin: Add support and warnings for $.parseJSON(falsy_value).
[11:04:24] <doesallmagic> * dave.methvin: Skip qunit on testswarm; use 1.9/2.0 git files.
[11:07:18] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: can you kill this job?
[11:07:23] <DaveMethvin> or let me know how i can do it?
[11:08:10] <gnarf> ill do bot
[11:08:11] <gnarf> h
[11:08:57] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2455 good?
[11:09:35] <gnarf> shouldn't the plugin be "dev" ?
[11:09:41] <gnarf> for the "local version" ?
[11:10:01] <gnarf> not sure whats going on in that suite
[11:10:04] <gnarf> i haven't looked at it much
[11:11:55] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: i've backed it off to a really simple set of tests
[11:12:04] <DaveMethvin> i can click the link on the test itself and it works
[11:12:08] <DaveMethvin> but the jobs are getting stuck
[11:12:15] <DaveMethvin> yes, dev should work
[11:12:22] <DaveMethvin> but i punted
[11:12:42] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/build/jquery-migrate/c050d4fa2664e39c03bfbd8b36b621c964eca8a6/test/index.html?plugin=git&jquery=git
[11:12:48] <gnarf> yeah
[11:12:49] <DaveMethvin> that works for me for example
[11:12:58] <gnarf> it shouldn't be loading from the -git url
[11:13:03] <DaveMethvin> and happens in about 4 seconds
[11:13:11] <gnarf> that will most likely not be up-to-date by the time the test runs
[11:13:25] <DaveMethvin> well i'm just trying to figure out why it's broken
[11:13:26] <DaveMethvin> at this point
[11:13:33] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: is there swarminject code in the testinit?
[11:13:52] <DaveMethvin> oh maybe i missed a part 
[11:13:56] <gnarf> because thats what creates the feedback loop
[11:14:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah, missing :D
[11:15:27] <gnarf> make sure its using the "local" dist/ version too
[11:15:36] <gnarf> because otherwise you're testing a cache
[11:16:19] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Migrate Core 1.x build #9: STILL FAILING in 10 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Migrate%20Core%201.x/9/
[11:16:20] <doesallmagic> dave.methvin: Start with simplest possible testswarm config.
[11:16:29] <gnarf> (i deleted that broken job)
[11:19:47] <DaveMethvin> okay, let's see if that works better
[11:22:00] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Migrate Core 1.x build #10: STILL FAILING in 1 min 53 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Migrate%20Core%201.x/10/
[11:22:00] <doesallmagic> dave.methvin: Add the testswarm injection code and QUnit config.
[11:23:45] <gnarf> hrm
[11:23:50] <gnarf> at least it responded
[11:23:50] <gnarf> :)
[11:24:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah i just have to get the url for the dist/ right
[11:24:10] <DaveMethvin> so where ARE those files?
[11:24:18] <DaveMethvin> should a relative url get to them?
[11:24:47] <gnarf> seems this is wrong http://swarm.jquery.org/build/jquery-migrate/jquery-migrate/dist/jquery-migrate.js
[11:24:54] <gnarf> relative should get to it 
[11:24:55] <gnarf> right
[11:25:16] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/build/jquery-migrate/d4cc9fdbcfa986538829391652a6c5cbb59060ef/dist/jquery-migrate.js
[11:25:23] <gnarf> ../dist/jquery-migrate.js 
[11:25:28] <DaveMethvin> right
[11:28:03] <DaveMethvin> gnarf i see what it is
[11:28:13] <DaveMethvin> i am assuming the jquery-migrate dir name
[11:28:36] <DaveMethvin> in testinit.js/loadProject
[11:28:53] <DaveMethvin> i'll fix that
[11:41:40] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2457 gnarf :D :D
[11:41:43] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Migrate Core 1.x build #11: SUCCESS in 2 min 9 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Migrate%20Core%201.x/11/
[11:41:43] <doesallmagic> dave.methvin: Do not assume project directory name.
[11:43:37] <gnarf> yay!
[11:43:57] <DaveMethvin> yeah so now i need to get all the test combos cleaned up
[11:44:31] <DaveMethvin> right now i'm using the smaller browser set but i need to get oldIEs as well
[11:44:39] <DaveMethvin> which probably means a second job
[11:45:05] <DaveMethvin> but at least all the plumbing is in place now
[11:45:52] <DaveMethvin> plus i KNOW it's failing with the older jqueries at the moment
[11:47:37] <gnarf> at least it has some CI in place, and is building -git versions now
[13:14:16] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: looks like the swarm stuff is working?
[13:14:26] <DaveMethvin> yes, thanks for your help
[13:14:40] <DaveMethvin> the stuff that's still broken is what is left for me to do :)
[14:14:59] <DaveMethvin> hokay
[14:52:09] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I just showed http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13335 to Luke Hoban from IE
[14:52:26] <rwaldron> he's going to push it through to right people on the ASP.NET team
[14:52:46] <DaveMethvin> Did you see the other post about it?
[14:52:52] <DaveMethvin> basically it breaks all stack tracers
[14:53:26] <DaveMethvin> it certainly can be fixed in the asp.net case but the question is how long before it gets fixed and people upgrade
[14:53:30] <DaveMethvin> could be a long time
[14:53:49] <rwaldron> but not QUnit... which does stack tracing, right?
[14:54:30] <DaveMethvin> the stack has to start outside jquery, then come in and go back out
[14:54:39] <DaveMethvin> so like, a triggered event won't hurt
[14:54:44] <DaveMethvin> but a native one will
[14:54:50] <rwaldron> hm.
[14:55:06] <DaveMethvin> thats the use case where someone gets bitten
[14:55:36] <DaveMethvin> i think QUnit is using the .stack isn't it?
[14:55:57] <DaveMethvin> let's look
[14:56:52] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[14:57:06] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/master/qunit/qunit.js#L1332
[14:57:47] <DaveMethvin> so code that supports for example ie9 will use the callee stack 
[15:02:16] <DaveMethvin> back
[15:02:31] <DaveMethvin> sorry rwaldron my window locked up
[15:04:38] <rwaldron> no worries
[15:05:01] <DaveMethvin> so anyway, the problem seems to be that caller/callee aren't being maintained in "use strict" code
[15:05:11] <DaveMethvin> so you can't trace through them
[15:05:31] <DaveMethvin> so we tend to think of "use strict" as being scoped
[15:05:34] <DaveMethvin> but in this case it's not
[15:05:40] <DaveMethvin> it's affecting people who didn't opt in
[15:08:23] <DaveMethvin> and not just by returning null or something, at least in the case of firefox it was throwing an error
[15:09:23] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/eriwen/javascript-stacktrace/issues/47  haha
[15:09:24] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: Issue #47 by jphaas (4h 10m ago): printStackTrace throws exception when called from "use strict" code
[15:10:20] <DaveMethvin> what's funny is that callee has been the de facto way to trace stacks on IE since IE6, and works on most other browsers as well until "use strict"
[15:10:49] <DaveMethvin> IE will even let  you trace a stack across an event boundary at times
[15:11:01] <DaveMethvin> like for window.onerror
[15:14:52] <snover> hilarious dave
[15:14:59] <snover> :)
[15:15:35] <snover> asp.net postbacks, same thing
[15:16:51] <DaveMethvin> did you see that postback code snover?
[15:17:07] <DaveMethvin> it's craaaazy
[15:17:17] <snover> i try not to think about it
[15:17:58] <DaveMethvin> on the one hand i think code that crazy deserves to break ... they're making so many bad assumptions
[15:18:15] <DaveMethvin> but otoh the people who get hurt are the ones running their sites
[15:26:11] <snover> i don’t feel like strict mode provides compelling benefits, but what do i know really
[15:26:45] <snover> once some guy caught an error in his code because it threw on setting a read-only property with [[Put]] instead of silently doing nothing so that makes it worthwhile to use everywhere all the time in libraries right?
[15:34:48] <DaveMethvin> you know who else was strict? Hitler.
[15:37:37] <gf3> TOO SOON

[15:44:35] <gibson042> I'm not saying the events are related, but after I expressed "use strict" Douglas Crockford himself blessed my prototype extensions and a bus full of supermodels broke down in front of my house and I found the golden ticket in my Wonka bar and I am never deleting it IE be damned
[15:45:06] <DaveMethvin> haha
[15:47:28] <snover> lol
[16:07:35] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: I've got a single assertion failing when testing against jquery-git, while 1.9.0 and below work fine: http://jzaefferer.github.com/jquery-validation/test/?jquery=git (git) vs http://jzaefferer.github.com/jquery-validation/test/?jquery=1.9.0 (1.9.0). The assertion does .is(":visible") - does that ring a bell?
[16:08:45] <DaveMethvin> if i had to guess I'd say https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/372e04e78e81cc8eb868c5fc97f271a695569aa5
[16:08:45] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: Timmy Willison (1w 2d ago): Treat an element as hidden if either offsetWidth or offsetHeight is 0. Fixes #13132, #10406.
[16:08:49] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: 
[16:09:30] <jzaefferer> oh now its either?
[16:09:47] <DaveMethvin> supposedly :D
[16:09:58] <DaveMethvin> we'd need to check with timmywil about it
[16:10:25] <DaveMethvin> is this like an empty container, possibly height==0 but has width?
[16:10:38] <jzaefferer> offsetWidth: 1000, offsetHeight: 0
[16:10:40] <jzaefferer> yay
[16:10:48] <DaveMethvin> oh darn
[16:10:54] <DaveMethvin> words to that effect
[16:11:12] <DaveMethvin> i think we've been through this before
[16:13:21] <jzaefferer> I can add min-height:1px to that container. Its supposed to stay empty by default, so I can't add placeholder content.
[16:13:54] <jzaefferer> Though I wonder who else will run into this with more serious consequences
[16:14:01] <DaveMethvin> well you KNOW if you've already run into it, more people will
[16:16:54] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: yeah this isn't good: http://jsfiddle.net/dmethvin/FZvav/

[16:24:46] <DaveMethvin> so it's really strange that an empty <div></div> is not visible
[16:24:57] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: can you see it?
[16:25:04] <DaveMethvin> welll...
[16:25:23] <DaveMethvin> i'm just saying it's a new interpretation of visibility
[16:25:56] <DaveMethvin> so if  you ask if something is visible and then start adding stuff ... pow it's visible
[16:26:09] <DaveMethvin> s/visible/hidden/ not g
[16:26:43] <DaveMethvin> i'm surprised we didn't break any other tests
[16:26:52] <DaveMethvin> or maybe disappointed :)
[16:27:14] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer happened to fail one of his unit tests
[16:28:24] <timmywil> true, it's different than it used to be, but the other way wasn't quite consistent either. For instance...
[16:30:13] <timmywil> s/either//
[16:30:19] <timmywil> it's more consistent now
[16:30:26] <timmywil> http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/FZvav/1/
[16:31:29] <timmywil> spans don't have width until they have content, so they weren't visible until they had content. so now divs are the same way. visibility is tied to whether it takes up space on the page.
[16:31:49] <timmywil> which solves some other problems
[16:31:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah i saw it closed two tickets
[16:32:06] <jzaefferer> is this landing in 1.9.1?
[16:32:24] <DaveMethvin> it's in there right now yes jzaefferer
[16:32:35] <DaveMethvin> i just have a bad feeling about it
[16:32:51] <jzaefferer> well, that seems like a bad idea for a patch release
[16:33:06] <jzaefferer> it makes sense to fix the inconsistency, but it has too much breaking potential
[16:33:35] <DaveMethvin> let me look at the tickets it closed
[16:34:41] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah
[16:35:12] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10406
[16:35:30] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13132
[16:35:53] <DaveMethvin> dammit browsers!
[16:37:06] <timmywil> so, what's the worst case scenario? is there a use-case we're thinking of where this would cause breaking changes?
[16:37:24] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: what was the case you encountered?
[16:37:37] <DaveMethvin> i am pretty sure we had the || here a few years back
[16:37:40] <DaveMethvin> lemme look back
[16:38:12] <jzaefferer> in my case I had an empty div with width:1000 and height:0, was expected to be visible
[16:39:47] <snover> but it was not visible.
[16:40:13] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4512
[16:41:16] <DaveMethvin> so at that point we had || and brandon was arguing aginst &&
[16:43:02] <DaveMethvin> ooh, snover reappears! http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4512#comment:49
[16:43:08] <snover> who me!?
[16:43:26] <snover> as long as past-me is not contradicting present-me, all is good
[16:43:28] <DaveMethvin> damn that guy is long winded
[16:43:45] <DaveMethvin> why didn't he just fix it?
[16:44:29] <snover> yes why
[16:44:41] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/35/
[16:44:42] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: Pull request #35 by csnover (27mon 3w ago): Fix for bugs #2185, #4512, #7111
[16:45:07] <timmywil> he did, mostly, but I think it had more to do with reliableHiddenOffsets
[16:45:11] <DaveMethvin> and it was && by that time
[16:45:13] <timmywil> right?
[16:45:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah but we went from || to && for some reason by then
[16:46:21] <timmywil> yea, I haven't found that reason yet
[16:46:43] <snover> because shortcuts are lame
[16:46:50] <timmywil> I think it was an attempt to fix false offsets for display:none parents
[16:47:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah but he got rid of !skip, that bum snover
[16:47:14] <DaveMethvin> just the name alone was worth keeping
[16:48:42] <timmywil> eureka
[16:48:53] <snover> EUREKA
[16:49:33] <DaveMethvin> stop vacuuming
[16:49:47] <timmywil> ok, I'm not looking at the old code right now, but based on http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4512#comment:6, I bet it was originally looking for checking visibility, rather than checking for hidden
[16:50:34] <timmywil> it WAS offsetWidth > 0 || offsetHeight > 0
[16:50:48] <timmywil> for trying to see if something is visible
[16:51:09] <timmywil> really && is closer for that
[16:51:26] <timmywil> we now do offsetWidth <= 0 || offsetHeight <=0 to check hidden
[16:51:42] <jzaefferer> my point was mostly about not making this change in a patch release. Its not a regression in 1.9 and has potential for breaking things, that's all. I'm out!
[16:51:42] <DaveMethvin> okay yeah that makes sense
[16:53:29] <timmywil> I take the point about patch releases, but I guess I'm still for keeping it
[16:53:43] <timmywil> up to you DaveMethvin 
[16:54:14] <DaveMethvin> i have a bad feeling about changing it
[16:54:39] <DaveMethvin> ideally i'd like us to go all the way back to display:none for visibility
[16:54:52] <DaveMethvin> b/c the other offsetWidth/Height stuff always bites us
[16:55:08] <DaveMethvin> plus it causes a reflow
[16:55:22] <timmywil> oh right
[16:55:28] <timmywil> reflows are stupid
[16:55:28] <DaveMethvin> but i don't think we could ever go that far
[16:55:42] <DaveMethvin> people expect stuff inside hidden elements to be hidden
[16:55:44] <DaveMethvin> until they don't
[16:55:46] <DaveMethvin> :D
[16:56:30] <DaveMethvin> so i'd say let's back this out and reopen those two tickets for now
[16:57:49] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I did some test reorg that I'd like to keep. How about I do another commit to change it back?
[16:58:03] <DaveMethvin> oh sure, that sounds good let's not lose the tests
[16:58:37] <DaveMethvin> now i just have to get jquery-migrate working
[17:06:19] <timmywil> woops, I pushed something else
[17:06:25] <timmywil> oh well
[17:07:47] <timmywil> just a style thing
[17:08:17] <DaveMethvin> just don't tell rwaldron
[17:08:23] <DaveMethvin> whoops
[17:08:29] <timmywil> lol
[17:09:56] <rwaldron> ...

[17:48:57] <DaveMethvin> whoa, timmywil uses Magic! It's super effective!
[17:50:00] <DaveMethvin> so gibson042, i'm working on getting jquery-migrate on swarm
[17:50:27] <DaveMethvin> trying to get the combo of buildFragment and clean working all the way back to 1.6.4 is beyond me
[17:50:30] <timmywil> :)
[17:50:58] <DaveMethvin> since we reorged that stuff heavily
[17:51:04] <DaveMethvin> so i think imma pull it out
[17:51:44] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: I think the way to do it is with the "support" pattern in test init
[17:52:23] <gibson042> count the warnings thrown from simple calls and use that to determine expected errors inside the tests

[17:56:23] <gibson042> if it does work, we'll be grateful for that count parameter to expectWarning
[17:56:55] <DaveMethvin> true dat, it's actually how i found one of the other errors in 1.6.4
