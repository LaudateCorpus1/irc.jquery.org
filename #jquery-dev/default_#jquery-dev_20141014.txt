[04:01:44] <m_gol> can we get browser vendors to run our test suite before release? :/

[09:59:59] <scott_gonzalez> We might want to consider creating $.fetch() instead of $.xhr().
[10:01:20] <scott_gonzalez> Or we can just start evangelizing fetch() instead of $.ajax() and point people to a polyfill until it's implemented everywhere.

[11:52:45] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: it's IE10+, though
[11:52:48] <m_gol> the polyfill
[11:56:37] <DaveMethvin> i don't know why i forgot about fetch ... we might as well use it, don't you think?
[11:56:54] <DaveMethvin> IE<=9 is probably because there's no CORS
[11:57:48] <DaveMethvin> it's just a question of how small a subset you accept and/or how large a polyfill you're willing to use
[12:00:29] <m_gol> yeah, it might be better to not reinvent the wheel
[12:01:01] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I pointed you to the spec a while ago. :) There was no polyfill back then, though
[12:01:59] <DaveMethvin> this polyfill definitely looks good as far as it goes: https://github.com/github/fetch
[12:02:12] <DaveMethvin> better than this one: https://github.com/Polymer/topeka/blob/master/polyfills/fetchPolyfill.js :)
[12:02:17] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: IE 10+ is because it uses Blob
[12:02:42] <DaveMethvin> maybe we should push IE9 into the -compat branch ?
[12:03:06] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I didn't even dream about you saying that :P
[12:03:27] <DaveMethvin> even if we're going to support fetch in -compat, it would be easier if we had CORS, blobs, etc
[12:03:59] <m_gol> but well, if we did that we might also switch to using classList for class manip in master
[12:04:10] <m_gol> some SVG lovers would kiss us
[12:04:40] <DaveMethvin> we'd still have to deal with android 2.x tho?
[12:04:44] <DaveMethvin> no classlist there
[12:05:36] <DaveMethvin> adding and removing classes is so basic that i think we have to keep it working no matter what
[12:05:42] <DaveMethvin> so we'd need two code paths
[12:06:13] <m_gol> Android 3.0+ :(
[12:06:14] <DaveMethvin> switching to using the attribute instead of the property might work tho
[12:06:20] <m_gol> always forgetting about this dinosaur...
