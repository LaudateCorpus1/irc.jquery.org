[00:00:05] <alystair> you'd assume that the 'step' functionality in .animate would allow you to modify the animation itself, not just external
[00:00:08] <gnarf> also see ?channels
[00:00:08] <bot-t> For support please go to #jquery or #jquerymobile. Development Channels: #jquery-dev - #jqueryui-dev -#jquerymobile-dev
[00:00:27] <gnarf> :)
[00:00:46] <gnarf> alystair: you could do it via a cssHook
[00:00:52] <alystair> everyone in #jquery whom know about the internals of .animation are sleeping - my mistake
[00:01:03] <gnarf> alystair: I'm also in #jquery ;)
[00:01:23] <gnarf> continue there
