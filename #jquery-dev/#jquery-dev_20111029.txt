[09:27:28] <tbranyen> urgh jqXHR offers no way to get at the original options?
[09:27:39] <tbranyen> var request = $.ajax(...); request.??? to get at options?
[09:35:12] <ajpiano> tbranyen: they're available $.ajaxPrefilter
[09:42:37] <tbranyen> ajpiano: woot
[09:46:29] <gnarf> tbranyen: they are also the "this" context in handlers
[09:46:39] <gnarf> but thats edited options
[09:46:41] <gnarf> not original
[09:48:30] <tbranyen> :-/
[09:48:31] <tbranyen> yeah
[10:12:21] <nicholasbs> I just checked out the latest source and ran the tests. #334 and #337 are failing in the latest version of Chrome. Is this expected?
[10:14:57] <gnarf> numbers don't help
[10:15:01] <gnarf> whats the test?
[10:15:26] <nicholasbs> One sec.
[10:15:39] <nicholasbs> ajax: jQuery.ajax() - error callbacks
[10:15:56] <gnarf> are you running it from a web server, or file:/// url?
[10:15:57] <nicholasbs> The errors are for success and ajaxSuccess inside of that group.
[10:16:03] <nicholasbs> webserver
[10:16:25] <gnarf> hrm
[10:16:31] <gnarf> those tests pass on my local
[10:16:46] <nicholasbs> What version of Chrome?
[10:16:52] <gnarf> canary
[10:16:54] <gnarf> and stable
[10:16:56] <gnarf> just finished both
[10:17:45] <nicholasbs> Bizarre. I just tried in Firefox and I'm getting the same two errors.
[10:18:46] <gnarf> sounds like something on the server side
[10:19:11] <gnarf> what is the exact string name of the tests failing?
[10:23:34] <gnarf> nicholasbs: do you have php on the webserver ?
[10:23:59] <gnarf> nicholasbs: that test depends on php
[10:24:30] <nicholasbs> ah!
[10:24:35] <nicholasbs> no, I don't have that setup.
[10:24:47] <nicholasbs> just stock apache on lion, which I don't think has php enabled by default.
[10:24:51] <nicholasbs> thanks, gnarf
[10:24:57] <gnarf> np
[10:33:18] <tbranyen> in qunit are you supposed to nest tests that are async?
[10:33:48] * nicholasbs edited httpd.conf to enable php and now all tests pass.
[10:35:29] <gnarf> tbranyen: ?
[10:35:51] <mikesherov> gnarf, you asked about chrome on server or local because of this, right? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4270999/google-chrome-allow-file-access-from-files-disabled-for-chrome-beta-8
[10:37:18] <gnarf> mikesherov: well the jQuery test suite has a lot of fails for local - it requires some php stuff, which obviously doesn't work
[10:37:22] <gnarf> there are also iframe issues
[10:38:52] <mikesherov> hmm, I run local, and it works for me... weird
[10:39:39] <mikesherov> maybe I gotta run
[10:39:46] <mikesherov> later
[12:26:58] <nicholasbs> As far as I can tell there's no way to create an account to edit the wiki on docs.jquery.com , is that right? If so, what should I do if I see minor typos in the docs?
[12:35:55] <kswedberg> nicholasbs: yeah, that's right. unfortunately, the old wiki was getting killed by spam. we hope to be able to put it out of its misery soon â€¦ after we finish up work on a new learning site
[12:36:19] <kswedberg> these typos are on docs.jquery.com or api.jquery.com?
[12:36:37] <nicholasbs> docs.jquery.com; just saw one minor one and went to register an account but couldn't
[12:37:28] <nicholasbs> (on this page: http://docs.jquery.com/How_to_Report_Bugs under "What To Provide", the sixth item isn't in the list properly)
[12:39:26] <kswedberg> nicholasbs: ah, gotcha. appreciate the report! in the future, until we get stuff straightened out, you could hit me up on IM (kswedberg at gmail) or just flag me here
[12:39:38] <nicholasbs> kswedberg: great, thanks!
[12:40:24] <kswedberg> sure thing. and if you get really into it and overwhelm me with pings, we can discuss setting up an account for you or something. ;)
[12:43:00] <nicholasbs> k :)
[12:47:53] <kswedberg> nicholasbs: fixed!
[12:48:00] <nicholasbs> thanks!
[12:57:57] <gnarf> hrm
[12:58:04] <gnarf> so what happened to RC2? :)
[23:35:48] <gnarf> just want to verify with a second opinion... http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7824
[23:35:54] <gnarf> i know its a ui ticket
[23:36:07] <gnarf> but both of these test cases seem invalid
[23:51:19] <tbranyen> i don't see the use case gnarf
[23:51:23] <tbranyen> i'm sure there is one
[23:51:47] <tbranyen> use each is pretty retarded
[23:52:04] <tbranyen> p.addClass.apply(p, [...]) ?
[23:56:31] <gnarf> tbranyen: thats what i'm sayin....
[23:57:26] <gnarf> like all his code seems backwards no matter how i approach it
[23:57:29] * gnarf shrugs
[23:57:34] <gnarf> chalk it up to pissy dude
