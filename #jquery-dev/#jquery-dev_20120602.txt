[11:53:01] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (1m, 26s ago): fixes #11293, getting dimensions of zero width/height table elements shouldn't alter dimensions
[11:53:29] <mikesherov> sigh, no messages
[12:09:13] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you here?
[12:09:55] <mikesherov> anyone?
[14:17:03] <kswedberg> gnarf: yt?
[14:24:20] <kswedberg> ?tell gnarf: restarted apache/mysqld on the blog box and it looks like it's working again.
[14:24:20] <bot-t> kswedberg, Okay.
[16:55:39] <gnarf> kswedberg: still here?
[16:55:39] <bot-t> (2 hours 31 mins ago) <kswedberg> tell gnarf: restarted apache/mysqld on the blog box and it looks like it's working again.
[16:55:45] <gnarf> kswedberg: seems api is unhappy again
[17:48:49] <kswedberg> gnarf: api.jquery.com looks good to me now.
[18:08:56] <gibson042> .
[18:09:07] <kswedberg> gnarf: hmm. I take that back. "Error establishing a database connection"

[18:48:58] <Krinkle> swarm01 is locking again
[18:49:00] <Krinkle> SHOW PROCESSLIST; shows the problem now
[18:49:02] <Krinkle> | 90956 | testswarm | localhost | testswarm | Query   |   233s | Sending data | UPDATE run_useragent SET runs = 0, completed = 0, status = 0 WHERE runs = max ....
[18:49:10] <Krinkle> this is the fix in cleanupAction.php
[18:49:24] <Krinkle> I am going to disable that since it shouldn't be needed and is insanely slow on larger swarms
[18:49:45] <Krinkle> "$resetRaceConditionDeleted"
[18:52:45] <Krinkle> killed a few of those queries and did a live patch in htdocs/inc/actions/CleanupAction.php to comment that out
[18:52:54] <Krinkle> swarm is recovering
[19:07:05] <kswedberg> gnarf: restarted apache/mysqld on api.jquery.com and that looks good now too
