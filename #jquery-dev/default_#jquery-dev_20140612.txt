[02:33:08] <Jattenalle> any OP's awake in here that are also OP's over in #jquery? if so, spambot: kikoop is ~net@90.174.4.237
[08:05:43] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: Do you have a few minutes to help me with the Sizzle speed test?
[08:05:58] <scott_gonzalez> I moved the frameworks to the exernal directory and I'm having trouble figuring out what needs to change to make this work.
[08:14:33] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: Nevermind. I was including ".js" twice.
[08:15:10] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: oh, good. Glad you got it figured out.
[08:15:36] <scott_gonzalez> Lots of indirection for file loading in the speed test :-P
[08:23:28] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: test/jquery.js can be upgraded to 1.11.1, right?
[08:24:37] <timmywil> Sure, it's only there for DOM manip.
[08:25:56] <scott_gonzalez> Bah, tests fail with 1.11.1. Looks like XSS protection.
[08:26:00] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just leave it at 1.9.1.
[08:26:49] <timmywil> Ah, yea. We can update that later.
