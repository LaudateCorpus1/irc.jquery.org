[03:13:30] <doesallmagic2> m.goleb: Core: Align code in intro.js with master
[05:04:18] <gabriel_schulhof> Hey! If anybody's around: After the removal of the event method guards in https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/a873558436383beea7a05fd07db7070a30420100, this can no longer work: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L619
[05:07:31] <gabriel_schulhof> It's breaking popup focus restriction in mobile. I'll try to come up with a simple test case.
[05:18:06] <gabriel_schulhof> That's proven rather easy: http://output.jsbin.com/ximexo/1/
[05:19:21] <gabriel_schulhof> It's because preventDefault() grabs the original event: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L686-L694
[05:20:17] <gabriel_schulhof> Can we maybe define originalEvent as $.Event() for the purposes of simulate()?
[05:23:57] <gabriel_schulhof> Using $.Event() seems to work there, so I'll file an issue/PR ...
[05:26:39] <m_gol> gabriel_schulhof: seems fine. a test would be useful, I assume this commit broke .preventDefault() on focusin/focusout everywhere outside IE
[05:28:12] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15gabrielschulhof opened issue #2300: Events: originalEvent must not be an empty object 02http://git.io/vUg8b
[05:28:19] <gabriel_schulhof> m_gol: I'll add a test.
[05:30:42] <gabriel_schulhof> m_gol: I'll also pore over event to make sure we're not creating any more events the wrong way.
[05:34:28] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, I'm not seeing any more places where originalEvent is being assigned.
[05:34:44] <m_gol> gabriel_schulhof: I guess a raw test agains .simulate would be useful as well. :) In addition to focusin/focusout
[05:35:54] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, that's a good point.
[05:37:41] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15mzgol opened issue #2301: Remove internal args to .on & .remove 02http://git.io/vUg0W
[05:48:28] <gibson042> gabriel_schulhof: it'd probably be both faster and smaller to just revert https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/a873558436383beea7a05fd07db7070a30420100 , which would also realign master & compat
[05:48:43] <gibson042> but either way, tests++
[05:49:19] <gabriel_schulhof> gibson042: Up to you *shrug* ... I'll put the tests in a separate commit, so you can just pluck those.
[05:49:49] <gibson042> thanks. I'm just especially sensitive to slowing down event processing
[05:50:58] <gabriel_schulhof> That's a good point. Event processing is pretty hot code.
[05:51:27] <gabriel_schulhof> OTOH, it's kind of a hack that an event is not always an event.
[05:51:55] <gabriel_schulhof> We had piles of these hacks in our tests, and this change exposed them.
[05:52:09] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and we even had one in our library.
[05:54:11] <gibson042> we might be able to drop that fake `originalEvent` altogether
[05:56:33] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. I have to go for now, but I'll check back in in about 8 hours - maybe sooner.

[06:29:40] <m_gol> timmywil: k, just wanted to make sure you know. this "UNSTABLE" message is easily ignored, it happens way too often :)
[06:29:56] <timmywil> true enough
[06:50:08] <timmywil> hmm, by all our criteria, br elements are hidden in safari 6/7
[06:50:47] <timmywil> no width, no height, no client rects
[06:51:26] <DaveMethvin> well that sucks
[06:51:50] <DaveMethvin> altho at least it can't be a container
[06:52:04] <timmywil> and they fixed in Safari 8
[06:53:39] <timmywil> I can't think of a workaround
[06:54:36] <timmywil> we could feature test, but I'm not sure what we'd read after that
[06:54:38] <DaveMethvin> we've been inconsistent forever on this, so i'm not sure it's too much of a problem 
[06:54:50] <timmywil> true
[06:54:53] <timmywil> WE WERE SO CLOSE
[06:54:57] <timmywil> stupid brs
[06:55:07] <DaveMethvin> at least with this we will eventually be consistent once Safari 7 dies

[07:18:41] <m_gol> debugging TestSwarm issues is such a mess :/
[07:18:47] <DaveMethvin> maybe their simulator has a different UA?
[07:19:29] <m_gol> I'm connecting from the simulator
[07:19:34] <m_gol> it used to be a problem on iOS 8.0
[07:19:41] <m_gol> it's correct in 8.3 which I'm using now
[07:19:53] <m_gol> i.e. I connected from iOS 8.3 BrowserStack live interface
[07:20:31] <DaveMethvin> there can be a diff between their automated and manual setups tho, that's bitten us several times

[13:34:12] <gabriel_schulhof> Hey! How exactly do you run the test locally? I've written a test, added it to test/unit/event.js, and when I open test/index.html in a browser, it runs the test, but when I run grunt && grunt test on the command line, it doesn't seem to run it.
[13:34:56] <gabriel_schulhof> ... oh, that's because the command line tests are promise tests, it looks like.
[13:35:36] <DaveMethvin> the only command line tests we could do are PhantomJS and those wouldn't tell you much, at least not for core will all its browser quirk code
[13:36:54] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[14:13:54] <Mr21> I don't understand why it's red: https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery/builds/62302667 somebody can tell me where I have something to read to understand my mistake?

[14:15:13] <DaveMethvin> that's what the error message says
[14:15:27] <DaveMethvin> did you run grunt locally? I would think it gives the same error
