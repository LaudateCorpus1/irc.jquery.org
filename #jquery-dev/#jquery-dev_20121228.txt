[07:47:46] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: can i tap your testswarm knowledge?
[07:48:38] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: sure
[07:49:05] <DaveMethvin> when we split 1.9 off we'll need to use the curent browserset for that
[07:49:16] <DaveMethvin> then we need master to be a reduced set without oldie
[07:49:21] <DaveMethvin> where is that stuff configured?
[07:50:07] <jzaefferer> its not yet puppetized, so it lives in a config file on the swarm server. Lemme look up the path
[07:52:13] <jzaefferer> so ssh to jq03, then go to /var/www/swarm/config and edit localSettings.json
[07:52:27] <DaveMethvin> i don't think i have that access jzaefferer
[07:52:32] <jzaefferer> I can create a set now - just drop all IE below 9?
[07:52:41] <DaveMethvin> yes
[07:53:20] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: As usual UI is ahead of the curve. We've been running two browser sets for a while (one without IE6).
[07:53:38] <DaveMethvin> so it also looks like the browserset is being passed to us in Gruntfile i assume if i want to override that i'll need to know the name
[07:54:34] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: does this look right? https://gist.github.com/fcf58ab3b300ed45ac0f
[07:54:49] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: yes
[07:55:22] <DaveMethvin> so i can pass in "popular-no-old-ie" as the browserset? What is the name of the one with oldie?
[07:55:59] <jzaefferer> the previous is just "popular"
[07:56:13] <DaveMethvin> okay, thanks
[07:56:57] <jzaefferer> I guess in one of the two branches you'll just use that set instead of the value being passed in
[07:57:13] <jzaefferer> that passing-in doesn't support different sets per TestSwarm user yet
[07:57:28] <DaveMethvin> well that's no problem as long as i can override in the Gruntfile
[07:58:06] <jzaefferer> okay, you should be go to go with that
[07:58:19] <DaveMethvin> thanks jzaefferer
[08:07:37] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: any idea what change in core could be causing UI-git tests to fail for effects? both master http://swarm.jquery.org/result/812299 and 1-9-stable http://swarm.jquery.org/result/812569 - ie < 9 has an extra failure, looks similar: http://swarm.jquery.org/result/809273
[08:08:47] <DaveMethvin> when did it start jzaefferer?
[08:09:22] <jzaefferer> I think its been a while. First time I noticed I pinged gnarf about it, but apparently he didn't look into it
[08:09:30] <jzaefferer> I can dig in
[08:09:44] <jzaefferer> I also remember looking through core commits and not coming up with anything
[08:10:01] <DaveMethvin> well at least it's happening everywhere 
[08:10:09] <DaveMethvin> makes it a bit easier to find
[08:11:04] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: is that the color plugin tho?
[08:11:50] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: last good: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%201-9-stable%20-%20git%20core/13/console first bad: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%201-9-stable%20-%20git%20core/42/console
[08:12:17] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: it only fails when testing with core, but yeah, could be something in the color plugin
[08:12:24] <jzaefferer> core/git...
[08:12:33] <jzaefferer> obviously we always use jQuery Core :-)
[08:12:51] <DaveMethvin> yuno zepto!
[08:13:45] <jzaefferer> so bad commit sometime between 2012-11-24 and 2012-12-19
[08:14:04] <jzaefferer> dunno why there were no builds inbetween :/
[08:14:26] <DaveMethvin> oh it's only a month :D
[08:14:54] <jzaefferer> almost!
[08:18:33] <DaveMethvin> so jzaefferer you said it was failing in master? I'm not seeing that
[08:19:29] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: yeah: http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/unit/effects/effects.html?jquery=git
[08:20:08] <jzaefferer> this looks suspicious: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/a918dc8aacb8461321c332f6f3b5756bdda5e8b2
[08:20:37] <DaveMethvin> try running the tests locally
[08:20:52] <DaveMethvin> oh wait
[08:20:57] <DaveMethvin> it's not using git
[08:21:17] <DaveMethvin> THERE we go
[08:24:06] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: so you can reproduce it?
[08:24:10] <DaveMethvin> yes
[08:27:13] <DaveMethvin> gotta go, be back in about 45 minutes
[08:28:03] <jzaefferer> animateClass is using $.when - did that change?
[08:32:29] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: can't really tell what effect this has, but could be related: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/23d7cf0488bfeaab51d8f55435cab01f5cf990ca
[08:59:25] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I think we had a lint failure for that long or something stupid like that.
[11:23:20] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: looking at that animation fail now
[17:30:07] <snover> breaking allthebuilds
[17:30:08] <snover> hi DaveMethvin
[17:30:19] <DaveMethvin> hey snover
[17:30:27] <snover> how are things
[17:30:30] <snover> i hear there is excitement
[17:30:33] <snover> and much deleting of things
[17:30:46] <DaveMethvin> oh yes, very deletey around here
[17:31:13] <snover> when do i get my amd modules? :)
[17:31:23] <DaveMethvin> pushy pushy
[17:31:32] <snover> hey! iâ€™m working on things too! :)
[17:31:37] <snover> besiiiiides
[17:31:48] <snover> easy path for you to use teststack
[17:31:49] <snover> if you want
[17:31:56] <DaveMethvin> i still have to land a few 1.9 fixes and we branch it and 2.0 is king
[17:31:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[17:32:08] <snover> it works great when you are not being dumb
[17:32:12] <snover> like i amâ€¦
[17:32:17] <DaveMethvin> won't work for me either then
[17:32:19] <DaveMethvin> :D
[17:34:58] <snover> i managed to put absolute mids in some tests
[17:35:05] <snover> that are not correct for the repo
[17:35:05] <snover> so
[17:35:10] <snover> good job me
[17:35:46] <DaveMethvin> if you don't screw it up how will you know when you finally get it right?
[17:35:50] <DaveMethvin> that's my motto
[17:36:25] <snover> http://zetafleet.com/i/50de4916e168e.jpg
[17:36:29] <snover> angry emails from the ci system
[17:36:30] <snover> thatâ€™s how
[17:36:56] <snover> really they should just replace that status message with ðŸ’©
[17:54:55] <snover> throw things at wall, see what sticksâ€¦
