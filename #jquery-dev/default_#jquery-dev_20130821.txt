[01:41:40] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15mzgol closed pull request #1337: Add bower install before grunt to fix bug build error, because of missin... (06master...06master)  02http://git.io/AaYv-w
[08:06:51] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: We should probably start doing two different builds for jQuery.
[08:06:55] <scott_gonzalez> One with a sourcemap and one without.
[08:07:10] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise everyone is going to start getting warnings about missing sourcemap files.
[08:07:16] <DaveMethvin> i am seriously considering removing the sourcemap comment
[08:07:30] <DaveMethvin> Chrome and the sourcemap spec need to get their shit together
[08:08:22] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[08:08:34] <DaveMethvin> i am  in the process of putting together a message about it, based on these kind of threads https://github.com/disconnectme/disconnect/issues/128
[08:08:34] <DaveMethvin> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17849006/hide-jquery-map-errors-in-google-chrome-developer-tools
[08:08:34] <DaveMethvin> http://wordpress.org/support/topic/get-wp-adminjquery-1102minmap-404-not-found
[08:08:34] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: Issue #128 by dy-dx (3w 5d ago): Chrome error: "Denying load of ...jquery.min.map"
[08:09:01] <DaveMethvin> cc paul_irish
[08:09:33] <DaveMethvin> sourcemaps should not need explicit absolute names and paths
[08:10:02] <DaveMethvin> sourcemaps shouldn't be enabled by default, or if they are the dev tools should be clear about why the 404 happens
[08:58:37] <m_gol> btw, Chrome 29 with the //# pragma is out
[08:58:58] <m_gol> we can switch, though I'd wait a little for the uglify task to switch for us, I assigned the bug to myself
[08:59:37] <DaveMethvin> cool thanks m_gol ... though it may not matter if we remove the comment ... this really needs to be straightened out
[09:01:10] <m_gol> yeah
[09:05:01] <paul_irish> there are two issues here
[09:05:26] <paul_irish> the wordpress ones is just that people are stripping out the map file and using the min'd JS alone
[09:05:51] <scott_gonzalez> Well, they're not stripping out the map file.
[09:05:58] <scott_gonzalez> We're only providing a min file that contians a sourcemap ref.
[09:06:16] <scott_gonzalez> And NOBODY has "get the source map" in their steps for obtaining jQuery.
[09:06:54] <DaveMethvin> maybe we need to force people to use Bower to grab all the dependencies :)
[09:07:40] <paul_irish> that's certainly a better solution but yeah, unrealistic.
[09:08:34] <paul_irish> the chrome extension one is chrome is being very whiny about whitelisting files that are expected to be accessible. this seems addressable. i just opened up a thread about it.
[09:08:57] <DaveMethvin> there are so many other issues here tho
[09:09:05] <paul_irish> like what
[09:09:10] <DaveMethvin> are sourcemaps auto-enabled when dev tools are open now?
[09:09:32] <DaveMethvin> somehow a lot of people seem to have it on when they don't know what it is :)
[09:10:04] <DaveMethvin> also, the sourcemap spec doesn't have a way to make map files relative or to survive renaming
[09:10:08] <DaveMethvin> and it happens ALL the time
[09:10:17] <DaveMethvin> happened for google cdn, and for cdnjs
[09:10:40] <DaveMethvin> it also means that when we release an official 1.11 for example, it's not the same file on all the cdns
[09:10:49] <DaveMethvin> it depends on what the name is the cdn chose
[09:10:59] <DaveMethvin> that affects the contents and thus the length, md5, etc
[09:11:12] <paul_irish> why arent the files identical?
[09:11:20] <DaveMethvin> they have the sourcemap name in them
[09:11:50] <paul_irish> what are CDNjs's filenames?
[09:12:08] <DaveMethvin> same as yours, but not the same as the ms or jquery cdn
[09:12:15] <paul_irish> i mean ideally every CDN puts online the exact package you hand over
[09:12:33] <DaveMethvin> which we now create depending on what file name we know you're using
[09:12:46] <paul_irish> for the google one we rename the files because what's provided has the version numbers in it
[09:12:49] <DaveMethvin> but it means the 1.10.2 you have isn't the same as our 1.10.2
[09:13:06] <paul_irish> right
[09:13:55] <paul_irish> so the solution to serving identical files would be to associate the sourcemap file via a HTTP header rather than a comment 
[09:14:12] <DaveMethvin> that would be one way, yeah
[09:14:28] <DaveMethvin> the two major dev behaviors we aren't resilient against are 1) renaming and 2) leaving the map behind
[09:14:50] <DaveMethvin> and the errors chrome fires are hard for "average" devs to understand
[09:15:00] <scott_gonzalez> HTTP header sounds horrible, TBH.
[09:15:15] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez: sounds fine for CDNs and bad for everyone else
[09:15:21] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[09:15:30] <DaveMethvin> it does solve OUR problem but i agree most web devs are unable to get a header set on their servers
[09:15:47] <paul_irish> :) web developers!
[09:16:11] <DaveMethvin> that's someone else's job, they'd never let a web dev loose configuring the server :)
[09:16:16] <paul_irish> i'm getting scooted out of the house by my girl. i'll be back online at work in 20
[09:16:23] <paul_irish> brb guys
[09:16:26] <DaveMethvin> bye
[12:54:20] <JamesMGreene_> Anyone know why `headers` is no longer part of the AJAX `options` object?
[12:54:30] <JamesMGreene_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/21143c3b213843bc202c16b5532b6e9de951eb2c
[12:54:30] <b-ot> JamesMGreene_: jaubourg (31mon 5d ago): Removed internal dataTypes option and added headers & crossDomain options into commented out options of ajaxSettings.
[12:57:25] <JamesMGreene_> Monsieur Batman isn't around, so if anyone else knows please chime in
[13:07:11] <JamesMGreene_> Are the API docs that wildly out of date?
[13:07:41] <JamesMGreene_> (as they say that the default for `headers` is `{}` rather than `undefined`
[13:07:42] <JamesMGreene_> )
[13:36:59] <m_gol> DaveMethvin, you here?
[13:38:14] <DaveMethvin> in a meeting, give me a few minutes
[13:42:43] <m_gol> ok, np
[13:43:45] <JamesMGreene_> timmywil DaveMethvin: Any idea on my question about ajaxSettings (and derivative options/settings objects) not having a default `headers` property value of `{}` unlike what the docs state?

[14:01:43] <DaveMethvin> m_gol sup?
[14:02:37] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: where are we standing on exposing jQuery.support properties?
[14:02:47] <m_gol> bc it kinda gets in the way of modularizing support
[14:02:54] <DaveMethvin> yes it does :)
[14:03:06] <m_gol> ;)
[14:03:13] <DaveMethvin> i think we need to expose jQuery.support (the object) because people add their own to it
[14:03:16] <DaveMethvin> including mobile
[14:03:26] <m_gol> yeah, the object, but can it be empty?
[14:03:45] <DaveMethvin> but as far as our own props are concerned we have said the interface is unstable and can change without deprecation
[14:03:47] <DaveMethvin> so yeah
[14:03:58] <m_gol> I hate doing things like support.boxModel = true bc the test is not needed anymore
[14:04:01] <m_gol> ok, thx
[14:04:16] <m_gol> I'll look at what we're testing, especially in 2.x
[14:04:24] <m_gol> maybe some support tests are no longer needed :)
[14:04:33] <m_gol> will have to test in Android 2.3, though, lol
[14:04:40] <DaveMethvin> FOREVER
[14:05:08] <DaveMethvin> if i ever get a flying car, it will probably use Android 2.3 in the dashboard
[14:05:21] <m_gol> in 2 years... "Today we announce jQuery 3.0 which breaks compatibility with Android 2.3. For compatibility we will maintain the 2.x branch as long as needed" :P
[14:05:28] <m_gol> hahaha
[14:05:41] <DaveMethvin> probably will be true!
[14:05:55] <m_gol> btw, I learned a funny thing today
[14:06:14] <m_gol> it seems IE9's console.warn is a function not inheriting from Function.prototype
[14:06:28] <arschmitz> m_gol: if you need anything tested on 2.3 or anythign mobile feel free to ping me
[14:06:43] <arschmitz> i have at least 2 devices on just about every mobile platform / version
[14:06:56] <m_gol> arschmitz: well, for the start I'll probably use an emulator :)
[14:07:04] <arschmitz> 2.3 i think i have half a dozen 
[14:07:22] <m_gol> but thx, will be useful to test the new broken-up support once I create a pull request
[14:07:32] <arschmitz> m_gol: yeah was just saying feel free to ask if you need something tested
[14:08:03] <m_gol> hahaha
[14:08:07] <m_gol> IE9:
[14:08:08] <m_gol> Object.getPrototypeOf(console.log)
[14:08:08] <m_gol> null
[14:08:31] <m_gol> console.log
[14:08:31] <m_gol>  function log() {     [native code] }
[14:08:46] <m_gol> I'm glad IE9 is dying quickly :)
[14:09:22] <m_gol> I had the same problem with PhantomJS earlier
[14:11:36] <DaveMethvin> I think IE9 doesn't even expose console.log unless you have dev tools open? I seem to recall that generating errors if you leave them in
[14:12:19] <m_gol> yep
[14:12:23] <m_gol> IE10 fixed that
[14:13:07] <m_gol> from all things fixed in IE10 I'm mostly glad they implemented support for >2 args in setTimeout/setInterval
[14:13:21] <m_gol> that's one of these things you can't feature detect synchronously
[14:13:27] <m_gol> by the very definition
[14:13:43] <m_gol> and since they removed conditional comments...
[14:21:48] <snover> why would you need that?
[14:22:29] <snover> multiple arguments to setTimeout/setInterval is just an implicit call to Function.prototype.bind

[14:37:03] <m_gol> snover: yes, but I find it easier to read
[14:37:11] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: still here? ;)
[14:50:54] <m_gol> why do we even have support.ajax?
[14:51:24] <snover> because ie lets you turn it off!
[14:51:39] <snover> and why wouldnâ€™t you want to know that?!
[14:54:26] <m_gol> oh god
[15:28:39] <terrycojones> I have a question about jQuery deferredsâ€¦â€¦ Is there any plan to support Promises/A+ ?
[15:32:03] <snover> sigh
[15:42:45] <terrycojones> alsoâ€¦ would anyone be interested in reviewing a draft of an O'Reilly book on jQuery deferreds?

[17:19:47] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: where are we staying on test failures on Android 2.3?
[17:20:48] <m_gol> the test suite runs DEAD SLOW on old Android, this is incredible
[17:21:03] <DaveMethvin> m_gol for 2.0? We're supporting it, right? 
[17:21:08] <DaveMethvin> it's half of all Android
[17:21:11] <m_gol> yes
[17:21:12] <DaveMethvin> we kind of have to
[17:21:18] <m_gol> but I think we have some failing tests
[17:21:46] <DaveMethvin> ugh ... we should have none but we dont swarm it
[17:21:54] <DaveMethvin> i think we may need to try that
[17:22:31] <m_gol> I can bet that different Android 2.3 phones pass different tests :D
[17:22:42] <DaveMethvin> :((
[17:22:56] <DaveMethvin> so sad but probably true
[17:23:25] <m_gol> I'm trying it on a 2.3.3 emulator now
[17:24:05] <m_gol> I dropped Safari 5.1 in my pr; wasn't sure if it's not too early but we won't release for another month so it should be ok
[17:25:26] <m_gol> wtf, trim tests are failing on 2.3
[17:25:54] <DaveMethvin> hmm, does it support String.trim() at all?
[17:26:09] <m_gol> there is no error about using this method so I gues it does
[17:26:16] <m_gol> but it seems it doesn't trim
[17:26:16] <m_gol> :D
[17:26:32] <DaveMethvin> hmm, kinda defeats the point of calling it
[17:26:51] <m_gol> it probably trims spaces but not all whitespace
[17:26:55] <m_gol> and we're checking for that
[17:27:03] <m_gol> 	equal( jQuery.trim("\uFEFF"), "", "zwsp should be trimmed" );
[17:27:03] <m_gol> 	equal( jQuery.trim("\uFEFF \xA0! | \uFEFF"), "! |", "leading/trailing should be trimmed" );
[17:27:20] <m_gol> what a nightmare
[17:27:58] <m_gol> if we want to test 2.3 on Testswarm, we need to exclude these tests conditionally
[17:28:11] <DaveMethvin> we have fixes for that in 1.x still, we can pull them back in if needed
[17:28:20] <DaveMethvin> oldIE does the same
[17:28:28] <m_gol> meh
[17:28:31] <DaveMethvin> i know
[17:29:13] <m_gol> there are more failures though
[17:29:17] <m_gol> I'll create a list
[17:30:02] <m_gol> I'll have to create a separate prs for support refactors for 1.x-master, too many differences
[17:30:24] <m_gol> yeah, lots of manipulation tests fail
[17:31:12] <DaveMethvin> i got a bad feeling about this
[17:32:17] <m_gol> well, we should definitely put this on swarm/jenkins
[17:32:27] <m_gol> no one is keen on checking tests on Android 2.3
[17:32:35] <m_gol> especially that emulator is dead slow
[17:32:41] <DaveMethvin> no one is keen on the black plague either
[17:32:46] <m_gol> ;)
[17:34:23] <m_gol> maybe some lovely time in the future we'll be able to put a policy of "only huge regressions matter" for Android 2.3
[17:35:25] <snover> DaveMethvin: android 2.3 is one third of all android, thank you very much
[17:36:00] <DaveMethvin> isn't android<4 something like HALF of it?
[17:36:04] <snover> no
[17:36:21] <snover> 2.3 33.1%, 4.0 22.5%, 4.1 34%, 4.2 6.5%
[17:36:24] <DaveMethvin> well then it's gotten better
[17:36:40] <snover> much like the black plague
[17:36:50] <DaveMethvin> i feel pretty
[17:37:32] <m_gol> snover: source?
[17:37:33] <snover> So whatâ€™s 33% of 38% of 18%?
[17:37:40] <snover> m_gol: https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html
[17:37:55] <m_gol> thx
[17:38:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah that did get better
[17:38:07] <snover> 2.25% of the browser market
[17:38:16] <DaveMethvin> around March it was like 51% for android<4
[17:39:12] <DaveMethvin> imma get a bunch of hammers custom made with "Android 2.3" and the alien logo
[17:39:18] <snover> which is like 1% more than safari 5.1
[17:39:23] <snover> doodaloo
[17:39:38] <snover> I am absolutely making up numbers that are plausible
[17:39:42] <m_gol> that's not a fair comparison
[17:39:50] <snover> are you sure?
[17:39:57] <m_gol> mobiles are used less frequently to access the web, hence lower numbers
[17:40:02] <snover> YUP
[17:40:08] <m_gol> IMO by this reasoning we might drop 90% of mobile browsers
[17:40:19] <snover> iPad Safari is like 4%!
[17:40:30] <snover> more than IE9 on weekends!
[17:40:44] <snover> (barely)
[17:41:07] <DaveMethvin> the problem with mobile is that people visit regular web sites with their stupid 2.3 phones
[17:41:11] <DaveMethvin> STOP DOING THAT
[17:41:19] <snover> the problem with mobile is that the keys are so damn small
[17:41:19] <DaveMethvin> problem solved
[17:41:49] <snover> according to wikipedia there are 11868 different android models
[17:41:54] <m_gol> hahaha
[17:42:09] <m_gol> DaveMethvin, why do we have support.ajax and do we really need it?
[17:42:18] <snover> i already told you why :(
[17:42:40] <m_gol> yeah, just wanted to make sure that's only it
[17:42:51] <m_gol> and I'm mostly focused on the second question
[17:42:59] <DaveMethvin> tbh i am not sure why we need it
[17:43:14] <m_gol> you can disable lots of stupid things in IE but we don't check for all of them
[17:43:38] <m_gol> so if that was the only reason, I'd say dump it
[17:44:51] <m_gol> moar red (tests still running)
[17:45:07] <DaveMethvin> m_gol they've been running all this time?
[17:45:28] <snover> i donâ€™t think you understand how slow the android emulator is
[17:45:34] <m_gol> I restarted in non-minified mode to better see messages
[17:45:48] <snover> ie6 on a 486 is slow, and then thereâ€™s the android emulator
[17:45:55] <m_gol> but it's running for at least 15 minutes now
[17:46:02] <arschmitz> real android 2.3 phones are slow enuough emulator is painful
[17:46:38] <m_gol> there are those Intel builds
[17:46:44] <m_gol> tried to use them once
[17:46:48] <m_gol> got kernel panicks
[17:47:02] <m_gol> turns out the problem is known but nobody does anything about it
[17:48:41] <m_gol> FINISHED
[17:48:44] <m_gol> 33 tests failed
[17:48:56] <snover> i think only android 4 has an x86 build?
[17:49:16] <m_gol> nope, there is 2.3.3 Atom build
[17:49:25] <DaveMethvin> now with extra slow!
[17:49:29] <m_gol> ;)
[17:49:38] <snover> my dev machine is an atom
[17:49:56] <DaveMethvin> i will type slower for you then snover :)
[17:49:56] <snover> i mean, the one that runs the web server
[17:50:01] <snover> not the one that i write code on
[17:50:09] <DaveMethvin> OOOhhhh
[17:50:25] <snover> if things i write run fast enough on that, theyâ€™ll run fast enough anywhere
[17:52:31] <m_gol> here you are, test results: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1339#issuecomment-23061748

[17:53:52] <DaveMethvin> OMG it's IE6 all over again
[17:55:29] <m_gol> do we have many Android 2.3 tickets?
[17:55:52] <DaveMethvin> none at all that I know of
[17:56:04] <m_gol> I guess not many people trim non-typical whitespaces on Android 2.3 :P
[17:56:06] <m_gol> etc.
[17:56:18] <DaveMethvin> the one seems to be related to the preventDefault code we were looking at recently
[18:16:07] <m_gol> I'd like to land support refactor before dealing with this Android 2.3 shit
[18:20:44] <DaveMethvin> m_gol doesn't look like you make it worse, so fire away
[18:21:14] <m_gol> well, I'll wait for someone to review my changes first
[18:21:41] <m_gol> I'd like to land these not-waiting-for-doc-ready-in-support fixes and then split support up in separate prs
[18:27:24] <m_gol> gotta go, cu
