[11:30:02] <leobalter> gibson042 jzaefferer Krinkle ping
[11:30:03] <leobalter> meeting
[11:30:59] <leobalter> although, there's not much news on QUnit from my side, I've been very busy at work. I expect to get back on QUnit later this week. 
[11:31:20] <leobalter> and I'll talk about the QUnit Roadmap this Saturday, online seminar
[11:37:26] <gibson042> yeah, that should be cool
[11:37:39] <JamesMGreene> o/
[11:43:47] <JamesMGreene> QUnit meeting over/not-happening?
[11:46:09] <JamesMGreene> gibson042 leobalter jzaefferer Krinkle?
[11:46:17] <gibson042> I don't have any news
[11:47:05] <leobalter> semi-over :)
[11:47:18] <leobalter> not many news
[11:47:28] <JamesMGreene> Understood
[11:48:00] <leobalter> I've got a busy work month but I'll be able to dedicate more time starting on Friday
[11:49:54] <JamesMGreene> I started a new job (at a different company) at the end of October so I've been busy trying to transition into that
[11:50:13] <JamesMGreene> May or may not afford me more time for open source, haven't got a concrete feel for that yet
[11:52:15] <JamesMGreene> (Back on Windows [for work] ;_; )
[11:53:00] <JamesMGreene> Alright, well, if nothing else... back to work  =D
[11:53:12] <gibson042> my condolences
[11:54:49] <leobalter> my condolences *2
[11:55:35] <leobalter> I hope you find an affordable time and keep the great work on Open Source projects.
[11:55:47] <leobalter> even if you need to use Windows for that
[11:56:53] <JamesMGreene> Mac at home now ;)
[11:57:26] <JamesMGreene> yes, I am sorely missing working on open source :(
[12:10:51] <Krinkle> JamesMGreeneAway: o/
[12:10:54] <Krinkle> leobalter: 
[12:11:00] <leobalter> hey
[12:11:29] <Krinkle> I've got a weekly meeting at this time as of recent
[12:11:35] <Krinkle> ended just now
[12:22:18] <JamesMGreeneAway> The current scheduled time works fine for me but I'm not opposed to rescheduling if it would help bolster attendance :)
[12:23:20] <JamesMGreeneAway> My typical Wednesday meetings for work are 9:00-10:00am CST (so they end 30 minutes before the current QUnit meeting time). Beyond that, I'm usually open [so far]
[12:33:36] <leobalter> Krinkle JamesMGreeneAway gibson042 jzaefferer I'll send an email to see if we find a better schedule for our meetings
[13:43:08] <defdom0> hello
[13:45:23] <defdom0> I'd like to start contributing to the code. I had a look at the issues listed on github. Can you suggest me any issue that would be well suited as a first contribution?
[13:46:38] <DaveMethvin> hey defdom0  ... you're talking about jquery core? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues
[13:48:02] <defdom0> Yes DaveMethvin, I had a look at the list. I was wondering if there are some tasks that may be easier to start getting my hands dirty in the code
[13:48:28] <DaveMethvin> we just did a bunch of cleanup on issues, so most of the ones left are hard ones ... let me look
[13:51:19] <DaveMethvin> defdom0: I don't see many that are good starters, but I know there are a bunch in the api docs ... https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues  several on pages 2 and 3 are marked "help wanted"
[13:55:11] <defdom0> thanks DaveMethvin 
[13:55:37] <DaveMethvin> thank you!
[13:59:12] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: do you know any restrictions on .attr that getAttribute doesn't have? attr('Î©') doesn't seem to work in Firefox
[13:59:23] <m_gol> and .getAttribute('Î©') works
[13:59:50] <DaveMethvin> not offhand, but that's an interesting case!
[13:59:55] <m_gol> a test case: http://plnkr.co/edit/WIbxxSPPdZqUr2WDiuWs?p=preview
[14:00:24] <m_gol> (open a console)
[14:00:28] <m_gol> ok, I'll report an issue
[14:01:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah, seems to work in IE11
[14:02:38] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15mzgol opened issue #2730: .attr() getter doesn't accept some characters in Firefox 02http://git.io/v4i8a
[14:04:52] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: broken since 1.7.0 :D
[14:06:11] <DaveMethvin> looks like String.toLowerCase is mangling the omega
[14:07:43] <DaveMethvin> oh HAHA it is turning uppercase omega into lowercase omega!
[14:07:47] <DaveMethvin> um
[14:07:48] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: yeah
[14:07:51] <m_gol> but it works in Chrome
[14:07:51] <m_gol> http://jsfiddle.net/cz57ey00/1/
[14:08:15] <DaveMethvin> so i guess this is a firefox bug? 
[14:08:26] <DaveMethvin> it must not be case folding non-ASCII chars
[14:09:08] <DaveMethvin> now i just have to read the spec to see who is right
[14:09:25] <m_gol> yeah
[14:09:30] <m_gol> that's the longest part ;)
[14:09:52] <DaveMethvin> there will be hundreds of paragraphs that we still can't decypher :)
[14:11:37] <m_gol> I'm sure it will require going through 10 links to reach the final answer
[14:11:46] <m_gol> starting from getAttribute
[14:12:32] <DaveMethvin> hold this rope, i'm going in! http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core.html#ID-5DFED1F0
[14:13:40] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: probably better to link to https://dom.spec.whatwg.org?
[14:14:06] <m_gol> seems names must have only ASCII chars lowercased: https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-element-attributes-get-by-name and https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#converted-to-ascii-lowercase
[14:14:36] <DaveMethvin> "converted to ASCII lowercase"
[14:14:38] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[14:14:45] <m_gol> so only Firefox is right?
[14:14:47] <m_gol> fun fun
[14:14:52] <DaveMethvin> no i think ff is wrong
[14:14:59] <DaveMethvin> b/c omega isn't ASCII
[14:15:10] <DaveMethvin> so only A-Z should be case folded i guess
[14:15:25] <m_gol> yes, but we're doing the folding, not firefox
[14:15:43] <DaveMethvin> oic ... wrong cave!
[14:15:50] <DaveMethvin> we need to know what toLowerCase does
[14:15:53] <DaveMethvin> :)
[14:16:38] <DaveMethvin> hold my es6 standard i'm going in again!
[14:17:21] <DaveMethvin> ok now i think our use of toLowerCase may be the problem http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-string.prototype.tolowercase
[14:17:41] <DaveMethvin> that seems to indicate that if there is a lowercase version of the char it shoudl be lowercased
[14:18:09] <DaveMethvin> and this gem "In other words, s.toUpperCase().toLowerCase() is not necessarily equal to s.toLowerCase()."
[14:19:13] <DaveMethvin> HALP WE'RE TRAPPED BETWEEN TWO STANDARDS AND THEY'RE CRUSHING US!
[14:19:30] <DaveMethvin> i think the toLowerCase was only there for oldIE, or at least that's the way i remembered it
[14:19:53] <DaveMethvin> i know ie6/7 had issues with that
[14:22:29] <m_gol> hmm
[14:22:36] <m_gol> if we could remove it that'd be great
[14:22:47] <DaveMethvin> yeah that can be done in 3.0 i'd think
[14:22:55] <m_gol> but if we wanted to fix it for 1.12 then we'd have to use our own toLowerCase that will only touch A-Z
[14:22:56] <DaveMethvin> but in the meantime ...
[14:23:02] <DaveMethvin> right we could do that
[14:23:17] <m_gol> shouldn't be hard but only if IE6-8 doesn't break on it
[14:23:21] <m_gol> because if it breaks then meh
[14:23:24] <m_gol> 3.0 material
[14:26:08] <m_gol> and it's not like we don't have things to do for 1.12/2.2
[14:26:13] <DaveMethvin> right .replace(/[A-Z]/g,function(x){ return x.toLowerCase(); }) should do it
[14:27:22] <m_gol> I'd expect IE 6-8 might have problems with non-ASCII attr names anyway (just a guess, didn't check)
[14:27:26] <m_gol> especially IE6-8
[14:27:28] <m_gol> * 6-7
[14:27:34] <DaveMethvin> true
[18:19:38] <Haydz> Hi, is it possible to use something like... if($('.element').is(':hover')) { } on content loaded VIA ajax?
[18:19:43] <Haydz> without using events :)
