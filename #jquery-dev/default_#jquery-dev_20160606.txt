[14:21:25] <Getfree> Anyone knows if jQuery will support getting and setting CSS custom properties?
[14:21:37] <Getfree> like this: $('div').css('--myvar')
[14:21:57] <Getfree> and this: $('div').css('--myvar','some_value')
[15:26:44] <m_gol> Getfree: support is in #jquery
[15:27:17] <m_gol> ah, but you're asking about the future, sorry
[15:29:04] <m_gol> Getfree: good question; could you open an issue?
[15:29:29] <Getfree> where do I do that? github?
[15:30:21] <Getfree> m_gol: ^
[15:31:59] <m_gol> Getfree: yes
[15:32:11] <m_gol> the changes to make that possible should be easy, the only question is if it doesn't harm performance too much
[15:34:26] <Getfree> It would be just a direct call to .style.setProperty() for setting
[15:34:56] <Getfree> and for getting I believe you must do two method calls

[17:10:58] <m_gol> timmywil gibson042: I had to run so I didn't have a chance to mention https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3062. Would fixing that be hard for 3.0.0? We've got an external report from an RC tester and it is a regression from 1.x/2.x.
[17:11:15] <m_gol> btw, we should have a label for regressions, they should generally have top priority
[17:14:08] <timmywil> I suppose specifying if something is a regression is helpful, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are high priority.
[17:14:40] <timmywil> if 3062 is a small fix, we can put it in
[17:21:50] <gibson042> it is a very small fix
[17:51:29] <m_gol> timmywil gibson042: I'll ping the reporter, maybe they'd like to report a PR
[18:16:38] <m_gol> I may have time on Wednesday if he doesn't reply until then
