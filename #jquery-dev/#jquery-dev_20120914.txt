[06:27:25] <Krinkle> Nice :)
[06:37:23] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: :-)
[06:37:59] <Krinkle> Installing 1 plugin(s)... Updating all plugins... Reboot Jenkins from the command line
[06:53:26] <DaveMethvin> COLOR!
[06:53:41] <DaveMethvin> okay, browserstack says they've fixed the chrome issues
[06:53:49] <DaveMethvin> my next commit will tell
[06:58:13] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12539 How is this guy still on Chromium 18?
[06:59:09] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: i dunno but it seems to work for me
[06:59:12] <DaveMethvin> on 21
[06:59:15] <scott_gonzalez> me too
[06:59:31] <DaveMethvin> and i shall close it that way
[07:19:13] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/LAB79A
[07:19:13] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Fix #12536. Start at .offset() 0,0 if no getBoundingClientRect. - Dave Methvin
[07:21:59] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, what's wrong with swarmy?
[07:36:37] <jzaefferer> swarmy seems fine, but Jenkins is unresponsive
[07:36:53] <jzaefferer> Krinkle, maybe related to that plugin installation?
[07:37:21] <Krinkle> It was fine after installation, its the reboot I did that brought it down
[07:37:26] <Krinkle> I just did a plain sudo init.d /je
[07:37:42] <Krinkle> I just did a plain sudo /etc/init.d/jenkins restart
[07:38:38] <Krinkle> Any idea?
[07:42:54] <jzaefferer> Caused by: hudson.lifecycle.RestartNotSupportedException: Failed to obtain the command line arguments of the process
[07:43:12] <jzaefferer> found that in /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log
[07:43:30] <jzaefferer> I guess the restart button inside jenkins doesn't work
[07:43:43] <jzaefferer> now its stuck, and an init.d restart is ignored?
[07:44:16] <jzaefferer> also jenkins is running five node processes
[07:44:27] <jzaefferer> that shouldn't be the case?
[07:45:43] <jzaefferer> trying another restart
[07:46:25] <jzaefferer> looks like its coming up again
[07:46:35] <jzaefferer> doesallmagic is back!
[07:47:36] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: started a jQuery build manually
[07:53:12] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: {url}/restart gives the stack trace indeed, doesn't seem to be working
[07:53:19] <Krinkle> "command line arguments"
[07:53:23] <Krinkle> that's where the .log came from
[07:53:31] <Krinkle> init.d seems to work (no error message)
[07:53:40] <Krinkle> but then the web server seems to be unresponsive on :8080
[08:07:29] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[08:07:30] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #371: FIXED in 20 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/371/

[09:30:07] <gnarf> jzaefferer: the node procs are botio
[09:30:26] <gnarf> jzaefferer: also, had to kill -9 the old jenkins process that was still running
[09:31:11] <gnarf> jzaefferer: since they needed to copy files to the swarm folder, i just made them run as jenkins
[09:31:56] <gnarf> two each for the two botio's and one for the testswarm-browserstack
[09:49:33] <jzaefferer> gnarf: okay, thanks for the clarification. I didn't see the jenkins process, what was the name?
[09:49:44] <gnarf> "java"
[09:49:54] <gnarf> there were two of em running
[09:50:43] <gnarf> made a nasty bump in the free memory: http://cl.ly/image/3V0K3f2H2Y2E
[09:52:00] <ryanneufeld> psh, you had at least a gig left :p
[10:40:45] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: nightmare when you don't have swap
[10:40:46] <gnarf> :)
[10:40:56] <ryanneufeld> ah
[10:43:58] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/560c178c82da95b2f88ae518552463d87fe5adbf#commitcomment-1856626
[10:44:41] <DaveMethvin> wat
[10:44:41] <b-ot> Please describe about NETWORK , I don't it exactly do .
[10:45:01] <DaveMethvin> not sure why that committed a sizzle change gnarf
[10:45:03] <gnarf> was it just a sizzle update that snuck in with your getBoundingClientRect commit?
[10:45:08] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/compare/9fb909e71fe0e152f80bf04198cc2b2098756c81...0a488ce5fa817bfa371658fc6cf0bd3214c5f3d5
[10:45:42] <DaveMethvin> well it's not in the functional stuff, just the benchmark
[10:45:45] <DaveMethvin> lemme check my local repo
[10:46:29] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, i think something is wrong with my local sizzle subproject
[10:46:45] <DaveMethvin> it's showing benchmark.js modified
[10:46:48] <DaveMethvin> and being a directory?
[10:46:59] <DaveMethvin> how do I reset a subproject?
[10:47:04] <gnarf> delete it
[10:47:13] <gnarf> git submodule update --init
[10:47:20] <gnarf> git reset --hard origin/master might work too
[10:47:24] <gnarf> after a fetch
[10:47:27] <gnarf> just like reset local state
[10:49:10] <DaveMethvin> had to blow away the subproject and reinit
[10:49:14] <DaveMethvin> that worked, thanks gnarf
[10:49:21] <DaveMethvin> not sure how it got corrupted
[10:50:33] <DaveMethvin> i didn't even notice that change at the bottom
[11:22:14] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: can you try something for me?
[11:22:24] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: do you have bower yet?
[11:22:30] <DaveMethvin> no timmywil
[11:22:44] <DaveMethvin> havent tried it  yet
[11:22:58] <DaveMethvin> in a mtg, give me about 20 minutes
[11:23:02] <timmywil> kk
[11:23:04] <timmywil> thanks
[11:48:31] <DaveMethvin> ok timmywil, i'm back
[11:49:09] <DaveMethvin> so i saw you did a commit with a json file for bower
[11:49:12] <DaveMethvin> haven't used it tho
[11:50:18] <DaveMethvin> and it won't install on my system .... windows?
[11:51:30] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: bower won't install?
[11:51:34] <DaveMethvin> nope
[11:51:44] <DaveMethvin> No valid targets found.
[11:51:48] <DaveMethvin> lemme check issues
[11:51:52] <timmywil> interesting
[11:52:47] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/twitter/bower/issues/42
[11:53:18] <DaveMethvin> but actually mine happens earlier
[11:53:22] <DaveMethvin> i can't even install bower
[11:53:29] <timmywil> yea that's strange
[11:53:31] <DaveMethvin> npm install bower -g fails
[11:54:12] <timmywil> node -v ?
[11:54:22] <DaveMethvin> 0.6.17
[11:54:30] <timmywil> that could be an issue
[11:54:43] <DaveMethvin> lemme install a newer one
[11:54:53] <DaveMethvin> seems like only yesterday i installed this one
[11:55:36] <DaveMethvin> damn, 0.8.9??
[11:56:40] <timmywil> I think 0.7 was skipped
[11:56:57] <DaveMethvin> well let me figure out where they moved the cheese, it's not on my path anymore
[11:58:29] <DaveMethvin> oh geez, now it's a 64bit exe which is in a different dir
[11:58:34] <DaveMethvin> STOP MOVING STUFF
[12:01:06] <DaveMethvin> yay, bower installed
[12:01:12] <timmywil> woot!
[12:01:21] <DaveMethvin> now where was i?
[12:01:38] <timmywil> ok pick a trash directory and try bower install sizzle
[12:05:06] <DaveMethvin> welcome to the hell that is unix under windows: https://gist.github.com/3724004
[12:06:15] <DaveMethvin> nothing that can't be fixed by a few hours of trying to find a path that works on both places
[12:06:29] <timmywil> haha ok. well. don't worry about it.
[12:07:07] <timmywil> I seem to get a permissions error when I try to bower install sizzle on my comp
[12:07:29] <timmywil> but it doesn't happen for anyone else so I'm trying to figure out if it's because I am an owner of sizzle
[12:07:49] <DaveMethvin> hmm
[12:08:08] <timmywil> wo, I just had an inception of deja vu
[12:13:51] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: ok, that's weird
[12:13:55] <DaveMethvin> wat
[12:13:55] <b-ot> I fetched O(arbitrary) HTML/CSS/JS in 2 HTTP RTTs, lolz
[12:14:02] <timmywil> I just removed my bower cache and it works now
[12:14:20] <DaveMethvin> wall, i think bower is still a bit preliminary afaict
[12:14:25] <DaveMethvin> nice idea tho
[12:14:52] <timmywil> true nuff
[12:15:10] <timmywil> I'm looking at yeoman tho
[12:15:23] <timmywil> and registering sizzle of course
[12:21:36] <Eviltwin> b-ot provides useful insights, no?
[12:21:36] <b-ot> Eviltwin, most likely.
[17:02:57] <johnbender> Anyone around who knows about the propFix object?
[17:06:23] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: ^ might you know anything about propFix?
[19:13:21] <snover> johnbender: what do you want to know about propFix? it is pretty straightforward, it maps html attributes to their idl equivalents
