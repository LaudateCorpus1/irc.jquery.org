[19:36:04] <m_gol> paul_irish: the support test refactor has landed :)
[19:36:15] <m_gol> now's the good time to test if the layout trashing is gone
[19:36:17] <paul_irish> yah!
[19:36:19] <paul_irish> i saw in my email you'd be happy for me to re-evaluate pref
[19:36:21] <paul_irish> kk.
[19:36:29] <paul_irish> the jquery-latest has it?
[19:37:04] <paul_irish> does http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git2.js ?
[19:37:15] <paul_irish> looks like it
[19:38:02] <m_gol> yup
[19:38:24] <m_gol> this is for 2.x but http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git1.js also has it
[19:38:37] <m_gol> and it might even be more important in many cases as 1.x is more widely used
[19:38:43] <m_gol> and has way more support tests ;)
[19:39:54] <paul_irish> initial look indicates the DOMContentLoaded event is twice as fast
[19:40:16] <paul_irish> i gotta run though. will take a bigger look later
[19:40:50] <m_gol> ok, np
[19:41:10] <m_gol> paul_irish: I only changed the tests that trigger layout to be lazy loaded
[19:41:23] <m_gol> the rest is still done at start but I guess that shouldn't be a problem
