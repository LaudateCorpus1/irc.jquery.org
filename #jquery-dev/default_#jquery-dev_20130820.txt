[06:06:23] <m_gol> meh
[06:06:50] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: any idea if IE team is even looking at comments to tickets they closed? My rationale is not getting any answers here: http://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/details/782835
[06:07:31] <m_gol> neither they did respond to your remark... meh, their dev relations suck so much
[06:08:18] <DaveMethvin> let me try to ping some contacts on this...it's really annoying because the IE team pushes hard for feature detection but doesn't want to provide a reliable feature detect here
[06:37:43] <m_gol> that's true
[06:38:26] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: they offered me a solution against sniffing for IE: first sniff for IE, then use .hasFeature() :D
[06:38:39] <DaveMethvin> lol
[06:39:11] <m_gol> it's even in WHATWG DOM spec now that hasFeature on non-SVG elements returns always true
[06:39:35] <m_gol> but I guess IE team doesn't care about WHATWG, only after it gets to W3C specs, am I right?
[06:39:36] <DaveMethvin> right and eventually their implementation of .hasFeature() will do that if it is right

[06:50:32] <m_gol> in my own projects I use trailing commas everywhere :)
[06:50:32] <m_gol> but I don't need to support oldIE

[07:04:15] <m_gol> :)
[07:04:31] <m_gol> but Jenkins still fails, why?
[07:05:30] <DaveMethvin> dunno http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1150
[07:06:14] <DaveMethvin> those look like they may be timing related? the fails are in iframed tests
[07:06:26] <m_gol> right

[08:46:46] <Solineoz> Hi everyone
[08:47:07] <Solineoz> Little strange behavior with the forum
[08:48:02] <Solineoz> As I post something, it is marked automatically as "Reported spam!"
[08:49:50] <Solineoz> Someone is alive here ?
[09:03:09] <Solineoz> Little strange behavior when posting on the forum
[09:07:31] <Solineoz> What are people doing here ?
[09:08:36] <Solineoz> Waiting for THE question they're looking for ?
[09:11:16] <Solineoz> If someone can answer me, I'll look at the logs later in the day, so here is the link from the forum where I've got "Reported Spam!"
[09:11:19] <Solineoz> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/drop-down-menu-19-8-2013
[10:01:31] <m_gol> tell DaveMethvin it seems I finally got an answer, though not on IE bugtracker but the W3 one: https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=18542
[10:01:40] <m_gol> too bad they don't plan to fix it in IE11, only later
[10:27:37] <DaveMethvin> Yeah I pinged them so it may be the bump from that
[10:27:43] <DaveMethvin> oh well
[10:28:05] <DaveMethvin> Solieoz, I dunno about anyone else but I was at lunch
[10:28:27] <DaveMethvin> checking the forum now
[10:31:14] <DaveMethvin> Solineoz, it looks like you commented as Guest, which always raises the suspicion of the spam filter
[10:31:39] <snover> ‚ÄúThis is because feature detection methods based on "I'll tell you if I think I support a particular spec" doesn't work.‚Äù HAHAHA oh ok, and inferring based on whether or not DOM properties are defined is so much better and more reliable
[10:31:42] <DaveMethvin> i marked it as not spam
[10:32:45] <DaveMethvin> i want a method Element.canPossiblyGenerateEvent("wheel")
[10:33:10] <DaveMethvin> of course the WhatWG would eventually define it to always return true
[10:43:24] <m_gol> snover: yes, it is. There's a difference between the browser claiming to support one particular event (and browsers are unlikely to lie about that) and claiming to support the whole DOM spec - in the second case they're almost always lying as if they support most of the spec they don't want to be left out and they'll lie
[10:45:29] <m_gol> The beauty of onevent attributes is that WhatWG is unlikely to define that DOM nodes have all possible onevent attributes present :P
[10:46:39] <snover> uh
[10:46:58] <snover> that is some specious logic you‚Äôve got there m_gol :)
[10:47:17] <m_gol> ;)
[10:47:33] <m_gol> that was half-a-joke ;)
[10:48:24] <m_gol> IMO it mainly boils down to the scope of browser declaration
