[06:41:37] <Justin_o> hello... I was looking at jQuery UI Tabs http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/
[06:41:56] <Justin_o> There are two sections for the disabled option, one is for a boolean value and the other an array of tabs
[06:42:20] <Justin_o> the boolean options doesn't seem to work, at least when you are instantiating the tabs
[06:42:33] <Justin_o> not sure if this is a bug or an error in the docs
[07:01:22] <louisremi> Justin_o: reduced test case please :-) ( http://jsfiddle.net can help you)
[07:01:42] <Justin_o> louisremi: sure.. one second
[07:03:55] <jqcommit> [jquery] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://bit.ly/jT5KmZ
[07:03:55] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Attribute hooks do not need to be attached in XML docs. Fixes #9568. - timmywil
[07:44:38] <Justin_o> louisremi: sorry about the delay.. try this http://jsfiddle.net/Ku252/1/
[07:54:22] <Justin_o> louisremi: updated it with comments and fixed a type-o in the code. http://jsfiddle.net/Ku252/2/
[07:56:30] <timmywil> .
[08:36:38] <jaubourg> hi there
[08:40:51] <jaubourg> meeting today?
[08:44:39] <timmywil> yup
[08:57:19] <JohnResig> hey all - sorry I'm late
[08:57:20] <bot-t> (139 hours ago) <timmywil> tell JohnResig tickets related to 1.6.2 are closed. We could do RC today if we wanted to.
[08:57:25] <JohnResig> internet was down
[08:57:41] <jaubourg> John: you're right on time, no worries
[08:57:44] <jaubourg> :)
[08:57:47] <rwaldron> JohnResig Thats ok... I'm laying in bed right now :D
[08:58:01] <JohnResig> ha
[08:58:30] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: what are you wearing?
[08:58:40] <jaubourg> Dave: do we wanna know?
[08:58:48] <DaveMethvin> lol
[08:58:50] <rwaldron> pj pants dude
[08:58:57] <rwaldron> ...filthy mind...
[08:59:13] <rwaldron> :)
[08:59:42] <JohnResig> alright, let's meet!
[08:59:58] <jaubourg> could we meat too?
[09:00:27] * Krinkle goes to supermarket, needs moar meat.
[09:31:28] <jaubourg> Dave: that's no restriction, it doesn't throw an exception
[09:31:45] <timmywil> rwaldron: so they're forcing update even on 3.0-3.6?
[09:31:54] <DaveMethvin> well es5 doesn't allow changing the arguments obj as i recall
[09:31:57] <jaubourg> it actually accepts the change then blanks the value with undefined
[09:31:58] <rwaldron> expeditious meeting!
[09:32:00] <timmywil> I didn't know that was possible
[09:32:05] <rwaldron> timmywil yes
[09:32:10] <rwaldron> but are still supporting 3.6
[09:32:18] <rwaldron> they've dropped support for 3.0
[09:32:20] <rwaldron> and 3.5
[09:32:35] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: it's good news for us at least, fewer to support
[09:32:35] <rwaldron> which have <1% share combined
[09:32:39] <rwaldron> yes
[09:32:40] <timmywil> hmm, ok so those with 3.5 will need to update themselves
[09:32:50] <jaubourg> Dave: just saying: it doesn't give me confidence in their js engine
[09:32:53] <DaveMethvin> of course life won't be worth living until ie6/7/8 are done
[09:33:01] <rwaldron> and hopefully by 2012, we can move Firefox to the current - 1 plan
[09:33:07] <rwaldron> hooray!
[09:33:09] <jaubourg> would be cool
[09:33:12] <timmywil> yea, if the market share is low enough, I'd be cool with dropping support, but probably not for 1.7
[09:33:19] <DaveMethvin> i have to get more coffee, brb
[09:33:19] <rwaldron> i know for _fact_ that we can trim some fat now
[09:33:27] <timmywil> ok yea 2012
[09:33:49] <rwaldron> timmywil well, for now 3.0 and 3.5 are nixed
[09:33:49] <jaubourg> bah, the world ends in December 2012... BEFORE IE6 does
[09:33:52] <jaubourg> go figure
[09:33:58] <rwaldron> 3.6, 4 and 5
[09:34:02] <rwaldron> as of today
[09:34:08] <timmywil> rwaldron: right now, the full suite passes in 3.0
[09:34:33] <timmywil> just saying don't want to mess that up in 1.7, but ok with it for 1.next
[09:34:58] <rwaldron> oh right
[09:35:00] <rwaldron> of course
[09:35:12] <rwaldron> but post 1.7... its hunting season in jQuery source

[09:35:40] <bot-t> https://gist.github.com/672714
[09:35:46] <rwaldron> updating this
[09:35:56] <timmywil> aight, lunch time, bbl
[09:36:30] <rwaldron> JohnResig if the contributing page is accessible via the api wp-admin, i can update that as well
[09:37:11] <jaubourg> gotta switch box
[09:37:28] <JohnResig> rwaldron: I think it's on docs.jquery.com, right?
[09:37:32] <JohnResig> so it's your mediawiki login
[09:37:41] <rwaldron> if it is, i can take care of that
[09:38:22] <rwaldron> nope

[12:16:57] <danheberden> ?answers
[12:16:58] <bot-t> http://bit.ly/kQB7mA
[12:16:59] <danheberden> there we go
[12:17:02] <DaveMethvin> lol
[12:17:06] <danheberden> christ, i'm just not with it today
[12:17:29] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: how DO we test them?
[12:17:44] <scott_gonzalez> heh, well in UI we don't :-P
[12:17:47] <scott_gonzalez> and we'd like to change that
[12:17:50] <DaveMethvin> i have similar issues with testing mouseover events
[12:17:56] <DaveMethvin> drives me nutz
[12:18:07] <DaveMethvin> seems like every release we hose them up
[12:18:09] <rworth> can't you test mouseover events with simulate?
[12:18:31] <DaveMethvin> maybe, although the simulation would need to be accurate
[12:18:57] <DaveMethvin> like if you mouseout past the end of the browser window
[12:19:15] <DaveMethvin> it's all the damned special cases
[12:19:23] <rworth> All simulate does is play back events you tell it to like a macro
[12:19:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah so I have to know and put in all the special cases :)
[12:19:43] <rworth> so if you specifify the event props same as the browser provides natively, it *should* do the right thing
[12:19:50] <rworth> yup :)
[12:19:58] <DaveMethvin> dammit, i want my work done for me!
[12:20:09] <DaveMethvin> these are computers! :)
[12:20:17] <rworth> computer machines
[12:20:34] <DaveMethvin> so do you guys have some thoughts on testing animations?
[12:21:06] * kborchers[A] is now away - Reason : In a meeting - back around 3:30 CST
[12:21:34] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: have you seen DOH?
[12:21:41] <DaveMethvin> no
[12:21:51] <DaveMethvin> link?
[12:21:56] <scott_gonzalez> http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/util/doh.html
[12:22:00] <danheberden> kborchers[A] can you make sure your away messages is as an actually away message and not a chat entry? e.g. "/away my reason for being away"
[12:22:16] <scott_gonzalez> oh, it's the DOH Robot that I'm thinking of
[12:22:33] <scott_gonzalez> http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/util/dohrobot.html
[12:22:51] <scott_gonzalez> uses Java to send create real events
[12:23:02] <scott_gonzalez> pretty cool, you can actually see the cursor moving around as the tests run
[12:23:43] <kborchers[A]> danheberden: sorry about that. still learning a new IRC client
[12:23:56] <danheberden> kborchers[A] np :)
[12:24:07] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, doh.robot sounds promising
[12:26:55] <scott_gonzalez> would be nice if clicking a link in their docs actually took me somewhere that worked
[12:26:56] <scott_gonzalez> just onc3e
[12:27:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'd say about 80% of the time that I've clicked a link from any of their docs, I've ended up on a broken page
[14:02:44] <rpflo> scott_gonzalez: awesome, that's the exact implementation I had written, except I named them callSuper and applySuper :D
[14:02:53] <rpflo> woops, wrong channel, sorry :\
