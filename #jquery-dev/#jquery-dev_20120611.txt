[07:21:38] <gibson042> .
[07:40:19] <nod_> hello, I've seen a tweet about jquery 1.8 being "modular" could someone tell me where I can find more about this? the forum isn't giving much results. Thanks.
[08:08:54] <sindresorhus> nod_: See the meetingnotes on jquery.org
[08:12:41] <nod_> sindresorhus: thanks! pretty hard to find this stuff out.
[08:25:03] <timmywil> nod_: it is not public yet
[08:25:20] <timmywil> i.e. released
[08:26:47] <nod_> timmywil: I thought there would be a post somewhere in the planet with more details, a tweet without at link for this kind of things makes you want to get the bottom of the story :p
[08:27:22] <nod_> timmywil: really nice work though :) congrats.
[08:28:10] <timmywil> nod_: we plan on having a blog post about using grunt to build jQuery excluding certain modules. This will probably be posted on or near the release date for 1.8. The whole thing is still in progress.
[08:31:28] <nod_> timmywil: awesome. I'm involved with Drupal and we're questioning the use of jQuery in specific parts of our JS. This kind of news is exactly what I'm looking for, that's why I'm so curious about it even if it's sill in progress :)
[08:42:29] <timmywil> nod_: cool
[09:09:58] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil DaveMethvin mikesherov_ nod_: I was actually specifically thinking about the impact of modular builds for Drupal this weekend. I have concerns about this being harmful if we don't do it correctly.
[09:10:17] <scott_gonzalez> We really need to support builds of only specific modules.
[09:10:19] <DaveMethvin> in the weekly meeting, this topic just came up
[09:10:25] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: say it in the meeting
[09:10:25] <DaveMethvin> you want to join there for a sec scott_gonzalez
[09:14:40] <nod_> scott_gonzalez: i'm probably mute on the #meeting canal but can provide feedback you can pass on about our drupal situation if needed.
[09:21:54] <scott_gonzalez> nod_: Would you just have a flag to replace stripped down jQuery with full jQuery when plugins say they need it?
[09:21:59] <scott_gonzalez> That would probably be an easy solution.
[09:22:12] <nod_> scott_gonzalez: yep, that's was my thought
[09:22:26] <scott_gonzalez> nod_: Cool, seems good.
[09:22:30] <nod_> scott_gonzalez: and hopefully later on we'll have something more evolved

[09:58:16] <jaubourg> stupid me is stupid
[09:58:30] <DaveMethvin> cool
[09:58:57] <DaveMethvin> i wouldn't have noticed so quickly except i was tryna fix another IE fail :D
[10:03:32] <jaubourg> heh, I didn't see we didn't have the supports grid for IE9 when refactoring, that's one
[10:03:36] <jaubourg> looking into the second one
[10:04:18] <jaubourg> lol, second one you probably took care of

[10:08:35] <jaubourg> grunt now says we save 4545 bytes
[10:08:39] <jaubourg> by removing ajax alone
[10:08:41] <jaubourg> boom
[10:09:50] <jaubourg> I'll work on putting serialize and al in a module of their own... so that people can use form validation while not having to get all of ajax just for serialization
[10:09:56] <jaubourg> just later
[10:10:45] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: ^
[10:11:15] <DaveMethvin> AWESOMES
[10:11:28] <DaveMethvin> hmm, i'm starting to sound like paul_irish
[10:11:34] <DaveMethvin> must revisit
[10:11:47] <jaubourg> you still need to add dancing bears all around for that
[10:11:59] <DaveMethvin> and unicorns
[10:12:08] <jaubourg> oh yes, UNICORNS!!!!
[10:12:20] <jaubourg> anyway, off of the comp I go while the gf is still around :P

[10:35:01] <Krinkle> jaubourg: ping
[10:35:09] <Krinkle> jaubourg: did something change in the required grunt command?
[10:35:22] <Krinkle> The plain "grunt" no longer works for jquery and is breaking every single test suite
[10:40:24] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle: i'm seeing one test fail, looking into thta
[10:40:35] <DaveMethvin> but you're saying plain old "grunt" doesn't build now?
[10:40:59] <Krinkle> I deleted the two broken jobs in testswarm to avoid them from taking over the swarm for the next few hours (all modules in all browsers fail  - and then the re-runs)
[10:41:39] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: I don't know what it does, all I know is if I do plain "grunt" and then submit that working copy to testswarm, it doesn't pass in any browser
[10:41:40] <Krinkle> including Chrome
[10:41:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i see that locally too
[10:42:02] <DaveMethvin> fails on the first test in support for example
[10:43:09] <timmywil> rwaldron: ping
[10:44:21] <rwaldron> timmywil ping
[10:44:35] <timmywil> rwaldron: what is diego saying? I'm trying to understand the problem

[10:46:20] <rwaldron> timmywil i told someone to file a bug earlier
[10:46:36] <timmywil> I don't understand his tests
[10:46:55] <matjas> timmywil: check http://twitter.com/4esn0k it started here a few hours ago

[11:08:10] <DaveMethvin> that should fix it
[11:08:42] <DaveMethvin> thanks for de-gunking the queue
[11:08:52] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: indeed
[11:09:07] <Krinkle> that was the first commit that I deleted of the batch of 2-3 jobs I nuked.
[11:09:45] <Krinkle> ah, interesting fix
[11:09:54] <DaveMethvin> well, hacky fix :D
[11:10:10] <Krinkle> ... so, this means it fails locally as well and jaubourg didn't run tests before pushing ?
[11:10:13] <Krinkle> bad boy :P
[11:10:24] <DaveMethvin> he must be spanked, and spanked well!

[11:29:21] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Would be nice if you could take the time today or tomorrow to checkout that branch and give me a review.
[11:30:01] <Krinkle> I'd like to push this out soon - does involve a breaking database change I'd like to get into 1.0 so that we don't need to upgrade twice.
[11:33:10] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: I so hate you... What went wrong? I tested with and without ajax and it worked
[11:33:17] <jaubourg> :P
[11:33:36] <DaveMethvin> it was generating an extra message on each filtered test
[11:33:49] <DaveMethvin> jQuery.active didn't seem to be initialized i guess
[11:33:50] <jaubourg> locally?
[11:33:53] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[11:33:55] <jaubourg> wtf
[11:34:00] <jaubourg> I DID test this
[11:34:14] <DaveMethvin> i always am running into caching issues
[11:34:18] <DaveMethvin> plus it's easy to forget to grunt
[11:34:34] <DaveMethvin> and on windows grunt.cmd doesn't work in background, or at least not for me
[11:35:04] <jaubourg> well, I don't use background to run commands, I always grunt and I check for cache because I know of such issues
[11:35:37] <DaveMethvin> you can see the patch I did, wasn't much to it
[11:35:57] <DaveMethvin> is jQuery.active defined at the point where testinit.js runs?
[11:36:04] <jaubourg> except it breaks for the build without ajax which needs oldActive as undefined
[11:36:19] <DaveMethvin> well better to break one than all-1 :D

[11:36:22] <jqcommit> [testswarm/results] ResultPage: Display runID/jobID pair as well - Timo Tijhof
[11:37:11] <DaveMethvin> i figured you wanted to set oldActive based on whether ajax was there but was gonna leave that for you to figure out
[11:37:56] <DaveMethvin> or even better jaubourg, only do the "ajax requests active" test if ajax is there
[11:38:05] <DaveMethvin> and hard set oldActive=0 again

[11:39:12] <DaveMethvin> haha even jenkins is yelling at you now :)
[11:41:08] <Krinkle> There's something up with the effects test
[11:41:40] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/238
[11:41:41] <Krinkle> presumably taking too long?
[11:41:42] <Krinkle> evne in Chrome
[11:44:12] <DaveMethvin> hmm, i just ran them, let me try again locally
[11:45:33] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle: runs in 42 seconds on chrome here
[11:45:38] <Krinkle> yeah
[11:45:49] <DaveMethvin> maybe focus issues?
[11:45:53] <Krinkle> You can click "effects" on the swarm and run it locally from that build, too
[11:46:41] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: is jquery-git.js getting built again?
[11:46:41] <bot-t> (5 hours 45 mins ago) <scott_gonzalez> tell mikesherov #8158 is totally busted in edge.
[11:47:06] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I agree
[11:47:07] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: You might be able to ignore that comment now.
[11:47:07] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: i don't think so
[11:47:26] <mikesherov> OK, there are some funky regressions in effects we haven't caught yet
[11:47:26] <DaveMethvin> i can build one manually and push it over
[11:47:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'm guessing the ticket that just got closed was the cause of it being totally busted.
[11:47:30] <mikesherov> for example
[11:47:45] <mikesherov> jqbug.com/8158
[11:47:52] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle: 42 seconds when i run that build locally too
[11:47:56] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: It's worth nothing though that the bug I filed was about IE.
[11:48:05] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: right, still busted in IE?
[11:48:21] <scott_gonzalez> Hard to tell with edge being busted.
[11:48:25] <mikesherov> I basically want to know if it's busted after jeffrey_to's pull got merged
[11:48:29] <scott_gonzalez> Do you want to know if it's still busted in 1.7.2?
[11:48:33] <scott_gonzalez> ah, ok

[11:48:37] <jqcommit> [testswarm/master] CleanupAction: remove dead code, fix syntax error - Timo Tijhof
[11:48:42] <scott_gonzalez> I can build locally and find out.
[11:48:50] <mikesherov> because there is ANOTHER major regression +DaveMethvin
[11:49:10] <DaveMethvin> wat
[11:49:20] <scott_gonzalez> Unless someone wants to update jquery-git.js
[11:49:30] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, this is awesome: jQuery JavaScript Library v1.8.0pre directly from dmethvin's computer
[11:49:34] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10521
[11:49:41] <mikesherov> so, open that in Chrome
[11:49:49] <mikesherov> open the fiddle
[11:50:06] <mikesherov> it's against 1.6.4, and you can clear see the bad behavior
[11:50:18] <mikesherov> but switch to edge, and even the *good* example is busted
[11:50:31] <mikesherov> http://jsfiddle.net/sRpYA/
[11:50:34] <DaveMethvin> consistency ftw
[11:50:50] <mikesherov> but busted in different ways
[11:51:02] <DaveMethvin> lemme update -git
[11:51:05] <mikesherov> I've been basically obsessing over the open effects tickets past 2 days
[11:51:09] <DaveMethvin> gotta dig out my command
[11:51:17] <mikesherov> I'm really nervous about how solid our effects tests are
[11:51:39] <DaveMethvin> well let's hope we get some people to test what we make avail during beta
[11:51:43] <mikesherov> because there are a few tickets that show "broken" behavior, that are now broken even worse
[11:52:02] <mikesherov> 10521 and 8158 need to be unit tested

[12:06:06] <DaveMethvin> lol you dastardly beast
[12:06:39] <DaveMethvin> oh but fortunately you didn't use DaveMethvin so IRC won't be making noises my direction :P
[12:07:50] <jaubourg> mikesherov: a lot changed in 1.8 all over the place and I, for one, am not really confident when it comes to backward compatibility... thankfully, we'll get the hate when 1.8 is released... then we'll release 1.8.1 and rainbows and unicorns will ensue
[12:08:32] <jaubourg> the fact we changed a lot of stuff in unit tests while changing the code that was tested is my biggest fear in that department btw

[16:31:07] <jaubourg> aaaaaaah
[16:31:37] * jaubourg shrugs
[16:36:11] <mikesherov> .
[16:36:27] <mikesherov> shit, more regressions in latest effects:
[16:37:03] <jaubourg> :/
[16:37:12] <mikesherov> run the following fiddle on edge, and then again with 1.7.1 http://jsfiddle.net/3QPx8/3/ cc rwaldron: gnarf:
[16:37:52] <jaubourg> the buggy animation looks better
[16:37:56] <jaubourg> but it's buggy ;)
[16:38:02] <mikesherov> right
[16:38:13] <mikesherov> but it at least does the right thing
[16:38:15] <mikesherov> that's 3 for 3
[16:38:30] <mikesherov> 3 out of the 3 tixx I was investigating in effects are MORE borked in 1.8
[16:38:31] <jaubourg> so we have problems with negative values?
[16:38:38] <mikesherov> it's prob easy fix
[16:38:45] <mikesherov> I'm just concerned by code test coverage
[16:39:35] <jaubourg> I went berserk regarding code test coverage for Callbacks and it's pretty difficult to do in a readable fashion
[16:39:56] <jaubourg> I can't begin to imagine the challenges for effects
[16:40:07] <jaubourg> well, I can, but i don't want to :P
[16:40:08] <mikesherov> do we have code coverage analysis
[16:40:18] <jaubourg> not that I'm aware of
[16:40:43] <mikesherov> Well, I'm sure we'll fix all of the issues, but it'll take going through all the existing bugs looking for regressions
[16:41:15] <jaubourg> I just usually cross several cases together in multi-level loops to make sure we go everywhere... and I agree with you that the coverage in effects is poor
[16:42:35] <jaubourg> maybe we could create some kind of a generic test system that would cross several different css properties so that we can spot bad interactions?
[16:51:10] <mikesherov> jaubourg, it's rfxnum in effects... doesn't recognize "-200px"
[16:52:04] <jaubourg> ouch
[16:52:39] <mikesherov> hmm, perhaps it never did
[16:52:44] <mikesherov> i'll keep poking
[16:52:55] <mikesherov> g2g
[16:52:57] <jaubourg> good luck and sorry I cannot help more than... well not
[16:53:03] <jaubourg> cya around mike
[16:53:22] <mikesherov> no problem, you gave some good suggestions about testing
[16:56:11] <Krinkle> I wrote a spy/inject analyzer ones, works great for simple object-based code bases where all you need to know is which functions have been called during the test, and which haven't
[16:56:41] <Krinkle> mikesherov: jaubourg https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/File:Screenshot-MediaWiki_QUnit_CompletnessTest.png
[16:56:47] <Krinkle> that's what it looks like
[16:57:05] <Krinkle> it outputs a list of propertyy names that are functions that weren't called
[16:57:25] <Krinkle> I'll see how it goes for jQuery
[17:06:04] <jaubourg> thanks Krinkle, that would be awesome
[17:13:38] <Krinkle> Weird.. I'm not getting anything
[17:13:43] <Krinkle> jQuery.protototype is an empty array
[17:13:48] <Krinkle> Has something changed in 1.8 ?
[17:14:23] <Krinkle> strange, in live 1.7.x as well
[17:14:29] <danheberden> prototototototype?
[17:14:37] <Krinkle> never mind the typo
[17:14:48] <Krinkle> I mean it, since when is prototype not enumerable?
[17:15:04] <danheberden> cuz it's an array
[17:15:07] <danheberden> with object props on it
[17:15:13] <danheberden> so when you look at it, it's, like, an array
[17:15:13] <Krinkle> Why ?
[17:15:25] <danheberden> length => 0
[17:15:28] <Krinkle> Not the jQuery object, I mean the constructor itself
[17:15:37] <Krinkle> window.jQuery.prototype
[17:15:40] <danheberden> ya
[17:15:45] <danheberden> that object - has length 0
[17:16:11] <Krinkle> WHY ?
[17:16:25] <danheberden> so that all the jQuery objects have a length:0 property be default
[17:16:32] <danheberden> and are treated as arrays
[17:16:33] <danheberden> ya?
[17:17:00] <Krinkle> jQuery.length = 2 for me; jQuery.prototype.length = 0
[17:17:08] <Krinkle> But either way I don't see the need for this
[17:17:18] <Krinkle> Array.prototype works fine
[17:17:30] <Krinkle> Array.prototype doesn't have to be array like for instantiations of it to be
[17:17:32] <danheberden> i mean, like, when you make a new collection $('.wat')
[17:17:36] <Krinkle> I know that
[17:17:38] <danheberden> you want length to be default to 0 - since it starts as an object
[17:17:46] <danheberden> thus, on the prototype, ya?
[17:17:50] <danheberden> or am i underthinking this
[17:18:02] <Krinkle> That doesn't explain why 1) jQuery.length is set, 2) Why jQuery.prototype returns an empty array.
[17:18:30] <Krinkle> it does explain why jQuery.prototype.length is set and why jQuery() may look like an array, but that's not relevant
[17:18:54] <Krinkle> may be a Chrome bug
[17:22:29] <Krinkle> danheberden: http://cl.ly/3A0F2v3H1N3v273F1G0M
[17:22:39] <Krinkle> Does. Not. Make. Sense.

[17:41:05] <jaubourg> mikesherov: good spotting :)
[17:41:51] <mikesherov> thanks, I got nervous the other day when I went to see if any open effects bugs were fixed by the rewrite, and to my surprise, a few were worse
[17:42:04] <mikesherov> so basically, I'm just going through each one at a time fixing
[17:42:19] <mikesherov> and writing tests of course
[17:44:18] <jaubourg> \o/
[17:46:00] <danheberden> Krinkle and it's still [object Object] - i was just thinking chrome was reporting an array on prototypes cuz of length

[17:55:39] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (16m, 19s ago): no ticket: Animation Hotfix: animations failing on "-200px" values
[17:56:11] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: sure thing
[17:57:26] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: I'm working through another animation hotfix as we speak. There are a few I found just by going through the open effects tickets, and seeing if the rewrite fixed things... in 2 cases, they made things worse
[17:57:51] <mikesherov> so, I'll obvious be covering those with tests, but I just think we need to go through that exercise
[17:59:23] <mikesherov> and the new failures we're getting in Opera... those are just from precision errors
[18:00:25] <mikesherov> we should really change the test to test for a level of tolerance, not an exact pixel... but I digress, I'll probably open a PR for that as well
[18:00:33] <mikesherov> I really want to get back to green
[18:01:44] <gnarf> agree
[18:02:43] <mikesherov> Hey gnarf!
[18:03:01] <mikesherov> I know you're in infrastructure world... I'll help out in whatever way I can for the animation stuff
[18:03:37] <gnarf> I kinda wanna bring up jQuery.later again
[18:03:42] <gnarf> gibson likes jQuery.soon
[18:03:52] <gnarf> but I feel like I need to use it here
[18:04:11] <mikesherov> I like whatever it's called, as long as it takes the place of setTimeout,0 and setTimeout,1

[18:04:40] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Fix regression for "-200px" in animations; closes gh-822. - Mike Sherov
[18:05:08] <DaveMethvin> yay
[18:05:23] <gnarf> I'm working on these callbacks
[18:05:34] <gnarf> and there is this strange issue it brought up with .fn.promise
[18:05:40] <gnarf> and unqueued animations
[18:05:49] <gnarf> which right now is making me curse jaubourg
[18:06:06] <gnarf> I think the solution is a jQuery.later()
[18:06:29] <DaveMethvin> oh b/c they're synchronous if already done?
[18:06:36] <gnarf> and Today is kinda a loss - I got a new macbook and am working on setting up my dev environment
[18:06:53] <gnarf> still don't have a VM yet
[18:06:55] <DaveMethvin> oh look everybody, gnarf got a new macbook!
[18:07:06] <DaveMethvin> sent from my iPhone
[18:07:06] <gnarf> yeah - no more batteryless MBP
[18:07:06] <mikesherov> or just a settimeout?
[18:07:18] <DaveMethvin> oh right, that piece of junk you carried
[18:07:29] <gnarf> mikesherov: yeah - it involves wrapping a function in a timeout :)
[18:07:38] <gnarf> now its a sleek air
[18:07:56] <mikesherov> macbook took me 3 hours
[18:08:06] <mikesherov> did it 3 weeks ago myself
[18:08:13] <mikesherov> sublime text2 is nice
[18:08:18] <mikesherov> never used it before
[18:08:23] <mikesherov> has tons of nifty plugins
[18:08:59] <DaveMethvin> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3poeus/
[18:09:13] <mikesherov> LOL
[18:09:48] <DaveMethvin> if we're bikeshedding i kind of agree with gibson042 that jQuery.soon makes more sense than jQuery.later
[18:10:03] <DaveMethvin> after all it's sooner than setTimeout, amirite?
[18:10:54] <mikesherov> I prefer jQuery.rightAfterNow
[18:11:32] <mikesherov> I prefer jQuery.putThisOnTheEventLoopToBeExecutedSoon
[18:11:53] <mikesherov> I need QUnit.almostEqual

[18:12:07] <mikesherov> QUnit.mehCloseEnough
[18:15:09] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov gnarf: can you think of any reason why we should leave include_js.php around?
[18:15:22] <mikesherov> no
[18:15:25] <gnarf> nope
[18:15:29] <mikesherov> ditch it
[18:15:36] <gnarf> brb
[18:15:36] <DaveMethvin> then it SHALL NOT PASS
[18:15:45] <mikesherov> we just need a way to test min too
[18:15:54] <mikesherov> rick has a draft for that
[18:16:10] <mikesherov> include_js.php can do it easily, but everyone seems to hate that idea
[18:16:30] <gnarf> back

[18:42:23] <Krinkle> mikesherov: no, git submodule update --init

[18:42:44] <Krinkle> mikesherov: Why do you ask? what's up
[18:43:05] <mikesherov> the QUnit change gibson042 contributes should stop the test failures in manipulation
[18:43:09] <mikesherov> contributed*
[18:43:27] <mikesherov> and DaveMethvin just merged in the submodule update, but it's not working
[18:45:28] <DaveMethvin> when i run that unit test locally with ie9 it passes too
[18:47:37] <Krinkle> mikesherov: http://swarm.jquery.org/index.php?action=runresults&run_id=3362&client_id=59508

[18:48:09] <mikesherov> Right, so... I don't get it
[18:48:31] * Krinkle tries
[18:48:44] <mikesherov> LOL
[18:48:59] <mikesherov> Are you saying it's in the jQuery test runner, and not in testswarm?
[18:49:27] <Krinkle> I'm not saying anything, I'm starting up  browserstack now and trying the raw qunit test suite
[18:49:49] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/249
[18:49:52] <Krinkle> click 'manipulation'
[18:49:57] <Krinkle> then use that URL in IE9
[18:50:08] <Krinkle> passes
[18:50:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah, so, uh
[18:51:04] <mikesherov> that's my point
[18:51:16] <mikesherov> passes locally, fails in testswarm
[18:51:18] <DaveMethvin> why do i so often find myself disagreeing with jenkins?
[18:51:18] <mikesherov> I don't get it
[18:51:42] <DaveMethvin> unfortunately i had to grab the bleeding edge QUnit to get the patch, so it might be borked from some other issue there?
[18:52:41] <Krinkle> tested in a clean browserstack instance as TestSwarm clieint
[18:52:43] <Krinkle> I see if failing
[18:53:06] <Krinkle> I think this is either caused by testswarm wrapper (unlikely) or due to the fact that it runs in an iframe, in general.
[18:53:26] <Krinkle> I'd say try it locally in a simple iframe
[18:53:38] <mikesherov> I dunno... locally for me it works, and by locally, I mean in browserstack
[18:53:47] <Krinkle> e.g. ./test/framed.html: <iframe src="index.html"/>
[18:54:13] <DaveMethvin> works for me in real Windows with a real IE9
[18:54:22] <Krinkle> you can do that locally on your disk and use browserstack tunnel to try it out in IE9 there
[18:55:59] <DaveMethvin> seems like we can't possibly be using the right QUnit version there
[18:56:37] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: how is that related btw?
[18:56:42] <Krinkle> are we talking about https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/742872984e000ff8e13b9a23e74852d1b549f161 ?

[18:57:58] <Krinkle> so I get to blame you :P
[18:58:22] <DaveMethvin> what does  your unit test look like Krinkle
[18:58:26] <DaveMethvin> does it use globalEval?
[18:58:29] <DaveMethvin> maybe that's why?
[18:58:40] <DaveMethvin> i'm good at guesssing when i don't know :P
[18:58:41] <Krinkle> what do you mean by "my unit test" ?
[18:58:57] <Krinkle> gibson added a fix to qunit with a unit test: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/258/files
[18:58:57] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on qunit by gibson042 (3d, 11h ago): Fix #257: ignore global exceptions inside raises
[18:59:03] <Krinkle> that passes in TestSwarm in all browsers
[18:59:18] <DaveMethvin> okay, yeah
[18:59:23] <Krinkle> (qunit itself is tested by qunit and monitored in Jenkins+TestSwarm as well)
[18:59:33] <DaveMethvin> that's basically the code we were tryna fix too
[18:59:48] <Krinkle> so it isn't caused by TestSwarm or by Jenkins or by the iframe business because it works there
[18:59:48] <Krinkle> s
[18:59:49] <Krinkle> o
[18:59:51] <Krinkle> it
[18:59:52] <Krinkle>  m
