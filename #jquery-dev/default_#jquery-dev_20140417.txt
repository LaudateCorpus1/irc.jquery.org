[06:07:08] <markelog> ping
[07:56:37] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: do you want to ship the beta today?
[07:57:05] <DaveMethvin> yes ... i haven't had the time to see where we stand though
[08:00:17] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: how do you like our newest test failures? :D
[08:01:22] <DaveMethvin> that chrome one?
[08:03:08] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: since when can that be "auto"? http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/page.html#break-inside
[08:03:20] <m_gol> it can't :-)
[08:03:29] <m_gol> I reported it to Chrome
[08:03:48] <DaveMethvin> I'll give them some widows and orphans!
[08:03:53] <m_gol> even if it could, computing 0 to auto would be weird
[08:04:09] <DaveMethvin> they should run our unit tests for canary
[08:04:25] <m_gol> https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=363562
[08:04:27] <DaveMethvin> we could do it ourselves if browserstack was on the ball
[08:04:32] <DaveMethvin> but fat chance
[08:04:32] <m_gol> yeah
[08:04:40] <m_gol> that's a good idea, though
[08:04:46] <m_gol> maybe they could run our tests
[08:04:59] <m_gol> BrowserStack has some lag
[08:05:07] <m_gol> so it has betas but sometimes not fast enough
[08:05:13] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: will you be around in about 3 hours? i think i may be ready for a release then
[08:05:27] <m_gol> but even if they're late by 3 weeks, we still have the next 3 weeks to test it
[08:05:44] <m_gol> unfortunately, I'll be busy in 3 hours
[08:06:04] <DaveMethvin> i want to go through the bug list to see what might land
[08:06:07] <m_gol> we still could test on e.g. IE previews, though, they're available quite early
[08:06:41] <DaveMethvin> anyway i'll work on things this afternoon and if someone is around to do the script that's fine
[08:06:43] <m_gol> (I'll have some time in about 4h 15 min but not a lot)
[08:06:48] <DaveMethvin> if not we can do it tomorrow
[08:07:07] <m_gol> I can do it tomorrow if today doesn't work
[08:07:16] <DaveMethvin> ok cool
[08:07:28] <m_gol> though I'll be leaving to visit parents on Easter on Friday about 6 p.m. CEST
[08:07:28] <DaveMethvin> i am always overestimating what i can get done in a day :)
[08:07:42] <m_gol> so about 12 p.m. your time I guess
[08:07:45] <m_gol> ;)
[08:07:54] <DaveMethvin> ok i'll try to get things done 
[08:08:00] <m_gol> so if you want me to run it tomorrow, an earlier hour would be great ;)
[08:08:17] <m_gol> I'll try to get to these Android failures after the beta
[08:08:26] <DaveMethvin> sure, they're not too critical
[08:08:27] <m_gol> and we need to figure out what to do with this Chrome failure
[08:08:41] <m_gol> IMO it doesn't seem important enough for us to workaround
[08:08:46] <DaveMethvin> agred
[08:08:48] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[08:08:52] <DaveMethvin> it's pretty trivial
[08:08:53] <m_gol> so we might just blacklist the test
[08:08:57] <DaveMethvin> annoying, but trivial
[08:08:57] <m_gol> in Chrome 34
[08:09:22] <m_gol> I just wanted to wait for the fix but oh well, if they don't fix it for 35, I'll change the blacklist to include 35 as well
[08:09:29] <m_gol> at least we'll know it's still broken :P
[08:09:36] <DaveMethvin> ok gotta get back to a meeting, they just started
[08:09:38] <m_gol> k
[08:13:34] <m_gol> cc paul_irish on the above ^^^
[08:54:40] <m_gol> oh well, I need to go learn some manners
[09:19:08] <rwaldron> gnarf you should get involved in this asap: http://dev.w3.org/fxtf/web-animations/
[11:44:45] <jqcommit> [13jquery-release] 15scottgonzalez opened pull request #61: Repo: Use valid semver for temp version (06master...06pre-pre) 02http://git.io/LHFF3w
[11:45:10] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/pull/61
[11:45:57] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: thanks! seems to make sense don't you think?
[11:46:06] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[11:46:44] <scott_gonzalez> We'll need to update the versions in the repos at the same time that we land this.
[11:46:56] <scott_gonzalez> Because now it will only accept -pre versions to start from.
[11:47:04] <scott_gonzalez> But that's an easy update.
[11:47:26] <scott_gonzalez> I tested this against fake-project and it worked as expected.
[11:47:40] <scott_gonzalez> I have the necessary changes for that repo ready to be pushed as well.
[11:48:21] <scott_gonzalez> One interesting thing I came across is that we don't have a way to do cross-project references when not using GitHub Issues.
[11:48:48] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't want to use "Ref jquery/jquery#15020" since that would be GH.
[11:48:54] <DaveMethvin> haha yeah was just thinking of that when i saw the PR
[11:48:55] <scott_gonzalez> So I just used "Ref jquery #15020"
[11:49:04] <DaveMethvin> first world bug tracker problems
[11:49:07] <scott_gonzalez> heh
