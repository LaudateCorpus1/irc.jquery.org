[02:59:27] <raffopazzo> Hello
[03:00:21] <raffopazzo> I have an idea for a small feautre in jquery which I'd like to discuss whether it's worth or not
[03:00:39] <raffopazzo> is this the right place ?
[03:41:47] <m_gol> raffopazzo: it's best to report an issue with the idea, then the whole team can look at it when they have time
[03:42:27] <raffopazzo> thanks I read about this but it didn't quite sound right to raise an issue
[03:42:28] <raffopazzo> :)
[03:42:34] <raffopazzo> I'll do it
[03:42:37] <m_gol> raffopazzo: but keep in mind we try to not add new features today unless they don't add weight and they're incredibly useful etc.
[03:42:57] <m_gol> especially if they're easy to do as a plugin
[03:43:24] <raffopazzo> Well, I think it will my case then
[03:43:37] <raffopazzo> just for the sake of completeness
[03:44:00] <raffopazzo> I started a small proejct https://github.com/raffopazzo/jamal.js
[03:45:32] <raffopazzo> basically instead of doing $('<a href="' + link +'">' + content + '</a>') and doing all that quote-management
[03:46:13] <raffopazzo> you would simply do JAMAL.a(link).div().p(desc).img(source) 
[03:46:47] <raffopazzo> so I though instead of doing a separate project, I might contribute to jQuery 
[03:47:05] <raffopazzo> which would be also better-looking CV-wise
[03:50:17] <m_gol> but you can already do that: $('<a>').attr('href', link).text(content)
[05:41:19] <raffopazzo> m_gol: I'm not a jQuery expert, so it just might be that you can do that. However, if you want to nest child elements you would need to do $("<a>").attr("href", link).append($("<div>"))
[05:41:49] <raffopazzo> compared to $.p().a().div().ul().li()
[05:42:31] <raffopazzo> but I appreciate it might not be worth to be built-in in jQuery
[05:45:34] <leobalter> raffopazzo: jamal implementation is really interesting but it's totally different from jQuery API. 
[05:48:53] <raffopazzo> leobalter: thank you. So, would you suggest to keep working on it as a separate project? Or would you suggest to consider writing a jQuery plugin ?
[05:50:08] <m_gol> raffopazzo: depends on what you prefer. ;) But I don't think such a thing fits into the jQuery API
[05:50:21] <leobalter> It's pretty interesting to keep it as a separate project. But I also think you can use jQuery as the base for creating the elems, etc
[05:50:58] <leobalter> And it's tested. :) 
[05:52:44] <m_gol> raffopazzo: and you can always create a set of small plugins like .addChild (maybe with a better name ;)) that will make it possible to you to do things like $("<a>").attr("href", link).addChild("<div>") (returns the new child)
[05:54:05] <raffopazzo> thank you guys, it's been worth sharing the idea with you
[05:56:45] <raffopazzo> I would then stick with the separate project approach. Hopefully the more I will need it into my own projects the bigger it will get and possibly more interesting for anybody else 
[05:57:04] <raffopazzo> ...if it makes sense :)
