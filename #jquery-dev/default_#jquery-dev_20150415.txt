[12:57:11] <Krinkle> markelog: would be nice to get this resolved. It's been causing false Jenkins failures at Wikimedia for over a month. Getting quite annoying.
[12:57:20] <Krinkle> If this isn't resolved, we may have to fork.
[12:57:34] <Krinkle> which would be a lot of work to update all repos to point to a different name and version.
[12:58:03] <Krinkle> Even if it's just a github branch temporarily without actual npm release...

[13:17:20] <markelog> Krinkle: wouldn't be easy to send us your solution?
[13:17:32] <markelog> in any case, i will prioritaze this issue
[13:17:53] <markelog> it's really pretty annoying :(
[13:18:48] <arthurvr> Thanks markelog!
[13:19:40] <markelog> :-)
[13:36:29] <Krinkle> markelog: We don't have a solution.
[13:36:42] <Krinkle> markelog: Although I'd love to help.
[13:36:55] <Krinkle> And thanks :)
[13:39:18] <markelog> Krinkle: so in your fork you would just remove one of the esprima deps?
[13:39:48] <markelog> Krinkle: i will try to work on it on the weekend, ideally i would like to resolve this in the next version
[13:39:58] <markelog> any help would appreciated :-)
[13:40:04] <Krinkle> markelog: If needed, I'd fork jscs esprima, remove "bin" from package.json, then also fork jscs and make it use wikimedia/jscs prima#master, and then also fork grunt-jscs to point to wikimedia/jscs
[13:40:28] <Krinkle> and then update 100s of repositories to use wikimedia/grunt jscs#master
[13:40:30] <markelog> Krinkle: yeah, sounds like a lot 
[13:40:33] <Krinkle> Which I really don't want to do .
[13:40:41] <Krinkle> It shoudl be trivial to remove bin from jscs esprima bin 
[13:40:44] <Krinkle> package.json
