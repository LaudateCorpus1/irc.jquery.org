[16:53:13] <Liera> hello to everyone
[16:53:25] <Liera> i'm new 
[16:53:41] <m_gol> Liera: support is in #jquery
[16:54:57] <Liera> i want to contribute to the coding part for i'm a web developer
[16:56:37] <m_gol> Liera: ah, sorry :)
[16:57:13] <m_gol> Liera: Welcome then! Would you like to contribute to one of jQuery projects?
[16:57:37] <Liera> yes
[16:58:00] <Liera> i know raw js
[16:58:36] <Liera> i'll be interested to work on a Jquery project
[16:58:54] <m_gol> do you have any particular project in mind?
[16:58:57] <Liera> excuse me if my english is bad i'm french
[17:00:25] <Liera> jquery core maybe
[17:01:57] <Liera> @m_gol : where can i start 
[17:02:08] <Liera> ?
[17:02:40] <Liera> is there any coding rules to follow? if yes where are they?
[17:03:06] <m_gol> Liera: I'd start with reading https://contribute.jquery.org/, there is some introduction there, description of a code style etc.
[17:03:52] <m_gol> jQuery Core might be a little difficult to start with but you may then look at the issues at https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues and see if there is anything you'd like to try
[17:04:04] <Liera> @m_gol thx very much
[17:04:35] <m_gol> there are other projects as well, though, like jQuery UI, we also need more people in documentation (see https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues)
[17:05:48] <m_gol> so please read the Contribute site and then if you find an issue you'd like to try fixing, comment there and we'll try to help :)
[17:08:03] <Liera> understood! thx
[17:10:08] <Liera> im reading now https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/ is there a place where i can find the enviroment setup for the coding?
[17:13:22] <m_gol> Liera: If you clone the jQuery repository at https://github.com/jquery/jquery/ it has instructions in README
[17:13:40] <m_gol> amongst others, you'll get JSHint & JSCS installed which are responsible for code style checking
[17:14:04] <m_gol> If you run `grunt` it'll tell you what's not right
[17:14:22] <Liera> ok cool!
[17:14:37] <m_gol> the biggest roadblock is that for PHP tests you need to have an Apache+PHP setup (for legacy reasons, it's hard to get rid of it now)
[17:15:07] <Liera> i already have it installed on my PC
[17:15:26] <m_gol> cool :)
[17:16:01] <m_gol> if you point the server at the folder with the jquery repo & open /test you'll get the tests run in the current browser
[17:16:40] <Liera> ok
[18:53:13] <cvrebert> Am I correct that there's no browser compatibility reason to use jqueryEvent.which over raw MouseEvent.button ? There's no "Support" comment near https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L624
