[00:48:37] <_|Nix|_> Hi, all! If anyone's awake: Is there any news on creating a ":any()" selector?
[00:49:23] <_|Nix|_> There's a forum discussion at http://forum.jquery.com/topic/feature-req-any-selector-filter ... it's all but dead.

[05:43:17] <bot-t> mikesherov, Okay.
[05:43:29] <gibson042> aww, thanks :)
[05:43:29] <bot-t> (12 secs ago) <mikesherov> tell gibson042 here's a message for you so next time you won't feel bad that you don't have any
[05:43:39] <mikesherov> LOL
[05:50:11] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/734
[05:50:12] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (11h, 25m ago): fixes #11004: getWH incorrectly removes padding and border width when box-sizing is border-box
[05:50:35] <DaveMethvin> looks easy enough
[05:50:36] <bot-t> (11 hours 20 mins ago) <mikesherov> tell DaveMethvin to check out this perf, .css('width') is waaaaay faster in border-box because it maps to offsetWidth http://jsperf.com/cssprops/4
[05:52:07] <mikesherov> thats basically the last of my css stuff for 1.8, besides adding some more tests, and some slight tweeks to support gnarf

[06:45:31] <scott_gonzalez> Who knows shell scripting?
[06:45:45] <scott_gonzalez> What's the correct way to do this?
[06:45:46] <scott_gonzalez> version_new=`node -e 'console.log(require("${repo_dir}/package").version)'`
[06:46:02] <scott_gonzalez> I need repo_dir to be interpolated.
[07:43:37] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: maybe like this?
[07:43:38] <jzaefferer> version_new=node -e 'console.log(require("$repo_dir/package").version)'
[07:46:38] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I got it. bash doesn't interpolate single quotes.
[07:46:48] <scott_gonzalez> I needed `node -e "console.log(require(\"${repo_dir}/package\").version)"`
[07:57:53] <jzaefferer> of course
[08:29:25] <gnarf> ?tell mikesherov whats up with http://jqbug.com/p733 - let me know if this sort of thing ever lands
[08:29:25] <bot-t> gnarf, Okay.

[13:48:47] <bot-t> (15 hours 50 mins ago) <paul_irish> tell krinkle .. no idea about that json.parse bug. no ideaaa
[13:48:56] <paul_irish>  protip: /msg bot-t .
[13:49:04] <Krinkle> thx
[13:49:16] <Krinkle> paul_irish: btw, I discovered another thing about that JSON.parse translate fn
[13:50:08] <Krinkle> that additional last iteration is causing something weird, trying to digg it up from memory now, brb
[13:50:16] <Krinkle> http://ejohn.org/blog/ecmascript-5-strict-mode-json-and-more/
[13:50:19] <Krinkle> the sample use there
[13:50:31] <Krinkle> actually returns undefined instead of a filtered object
[13:50:51] <Krinkle> because it doesn't return anything for the latest iteration of the magic super key ""
[13:51:02] <Krinkle> scroll down to "JSON.parse( text, translate )"
[13:51:17] <Krinkle> paul_irish: where should I report this? webkit, chrome or chromium? I never know
[13:51:24] <paul_irish> well
[13:51:26] <Krinkle> I suppose not webkit
[13:51:37] <paul_irish> webkit is wehre to report JSC bugs
[13:51:44] <paul_irish> try it in node
[13:51:48] <paul_irish> if its there its a v8 bug
[13:51:50] <paul_irish> (probably is)
[13:51:57] <paul_irish> then report it on v8's tracker
[13:52:00] <paul_irish> chroem doesnt have a bug tracker
[13:52:03] <paul_irish> chromium does
[13:52:23] <Krinkle> I don't have node set up here
[13:52:24] <Krinkle> and can't' easily due to lack of apt-get
[13:52:57] <ajpiano> Krinkle: there is a dead simple way to install node
[13:53:02] <ajpiano> as long as you have curl
[13:53:03] <ajpiano> :p
[13:53:22] * Krinkle is listening and googling
[13:53:30] <ben_alman> hey, how did you guys handle moving to an organization on github
[13:53:35] <ben_alman> who was in charge of that
[13:53:54] <ajpiano> Krinkle: just finding it
[13:53:56] <Krinkle> https://github.com/aaronblohowiak/curl-install-node#readme
[13:53:58] <ben_alman> i'm trying to figure out how i should go about moving it opver
[13:54:16] <ajpiano> Krinkle: that wasn't even what i was thinking of
[13:54:26] <Krinkle> I'm gonan check that url out first though, I don't feel comfortable executing bash on the return of a shortened url like "goo.gl/JD2SR"
[13:54:28] <ajpiano> danheberden: can you tell Krinkle the 1 line nave/node install
[13:54:28] <Krinkle> :)
[13:54:46] <ajpiano> Krinkle: this thing installs nave (a node version manager) and then it does the node install for you
[13:54:56] <Krinkle> ajpiano: okay, tell me
[13:56:35] <ajpiano> Krinkle: i think this is it
[13:56:38] <ajpiano> sudo bash -c "$(curl -s 'https://raw.github.com/isaacs/nave/master/nave.sh') usemain 0.6.15"
[13:57:13] <ajpiano> if that dosen't work exactly, you can just install nave using their .sh thing
[13:57:18] <ajpiano> ?g github nave isaacs
[13:57:20] <bot-t> ajpiano, isaacs/nave · GitHub - https://github.com/isaacs/nave
[13:57:24] <ajpiano> and use that
[13:57:34] <danheberden> sudo sh -c "$(curl -s 'https://raw.github.com/isaacs/nave/master/nave.sh') usemain stable"
[13:57:44] <danheberden> oh sry didn't know you found it ajpiano
[13:58:04] <ajpiano> np!
[13:58:30] <Krinkle> ajpiano: so what does nave do? or is it just an installer helper?
[13:58:40] <Krinkle> https://raw.github.com/aaronblohowiak/curl-install-node/master/install-node-v0.3.1.sh > https://raw.github.com/aaronblohowiak/curl-install-node/master/install-node-v0.3.1.sh
[13:58:51] <Krinkle> seems also good and much simpler, not sure
[13:59:02] <ajpiano> Krinkle: it's like rvm or rbenv for ruby
[13:59:07] <danheberden> bot-t: installnode is sudo sh -c "$(curl -s 'https://raw.github.com/isaacs/nave/master/nave.sh') usemain stable" # you can replace stable with version number
[13:59:08] <bot-t> danheberden, Stored "installnode".
[13:59:19] <ajpiano> lets you have multiple simulatenous node versions for different projects kinda thing
[13:59:31] <Krinkle> k
[14:00:02] <danheberden> or just use brew on a mac
[14:00:06] <danheberden> but nave is so nice
[14:00:15] <Krinkle> I am on a Mac, but I don't use brew or macports
[14:01:29] <Krinkle> executing installnode now
[14:02:34] <Krinkle> getting `sh: line 199: node: command not found` error from  https://github.com/isaacs/nave/blob/master/nave.sh#L198
[14:02:58] <Krinkle> seems to continue fine though, I suppose just an uncaught check that is bound to error
[14:04:32] <Krinkle> it's outputting a LOT of warnings in the console..
[14:04:50] <danheberden> did it not sudo?
[14:05:24] <danheberden> unless he has a bug that came up recently?
[14:05:31] <Krinkle> sudo went find
[14:05:34] <Krinkle> fine
[14:05:48] <danheberden> hmm he hasn't updated it since
[14:06:05] <Krinkle> but a lot of warning about deprecated function calls or methods declared multiple files or whatever other stuff, at least 3 pages full of scrap on my macbookpro
[14:06:16] <Krinkle> currentl at 10/70
[14:06:23] <danheberden> trying it now
[14:06:36] <ajpiano> installing node definitely can take a few minutes
[14:06:46] <ajpiano> and throws a lot of random shit like that at you
[14:06:48] <ajpiano> when it happens
[14:07:04] <Krinkle> but regardless, I appreciate the help, could some of you who have node already in the mean time simply try that little snippet?
[14:07:23] <Krinkle> http://ejohn.org/blog/ecmascript-5-strict-mode-json-and-more/ , scroll down to "JSON.parse( text, translate )"
[14:07:32] <Krinkle> throws a property of undefined error for me in Chrome console
[14:08:01] <Krinkle> which makes sense of translateFn is invoked for the json response as whole at the end with a magic key "" (empty string)
[14:08:01] <Krinkle> the
[14:08:09] <Krinkle> the question is wether it should be doing that
[14:08:49] <ajpiano> oh Krinkle i ran into this same thing a few weeks ago
[14:08:52] <ajpiano> got super confused
[14:09:02] <ajpiano> about that whole super key that magically crushes the whole thing
[14:09:12] <ajpiano> i made DaveMethvin explain it to me :p
[14:09:38] <Krinkle> I think my MacBook Pro could take off any minute now. Its like an airplane engine, boy that nave/node is really giving it a hard time
[14:10:11] <ajpiano> Krinkle: yea, i upgraded node yesterday, it's one of things where you go make a sandwich
[14:10:20] <DaveMethvin> mmmm, toasty testicles
[14:10:33] <Krinkle> ajpiano: if you put a console log in that translate function, you'll see that the last call is with key = "", value (everything so far)
[14:10:57] <ajpiano> Krinkle: yah, now i "get" it
[14:11:04] <danheberden> Krinkle sample output: http://danheberden.com/share/563cd2a.png
[14:11:07] <danheberden> just built 0.6.15
[14:11:15] <Krinkle> e.g. console.log(key + " (" + typeof key " + ")", value), but I doubt whether that is according to the specification
[14:11:36] <Krinkle> since it would make a filter function a bit non-standard, at least $.filter/map don't behave like that
[14:12:24] <Krinkle> danheberden: I use 'stable', yeah, that looks similar
[14:13:01] <Krinkle> danheberden: What did the initial check look like for you ? the first part with "Checking for program g++ or c++  "
[14:15:16] <danheberden> Krinkle http://danheberden.com/share/5df2c.png
[14:15:42] <Krinkle> http://cl.ly/470I1D292X173b2T0I1W
[14:16:26] <danheberden> i think that's ok, though? did it fail?
[14:16:38] <Krinkle> 'install' finished successfully (14.222s)
[14:17:18] <danheberden> i win! (6.752s)
[14:17:42] <Krinkle> Oh, nice it (node) default to a live terminal (like php -a)
[14:17:45] <Krinkle> interactive

[14:23:34] <Krinkle> lol, popular guy :)
[14:24:38] <Krinkle> "If it returns undefined then the property is deleted from the result." , that much I figured. I actually thought it would delete all properties for which translate-function returns an illegal JSON value, but its just undefined
[14:25:57] <rwaldron> I think the point is that it is composable (somehow?) with Object.keys() + Array.prototype.filter/map/some/every/forEach
[14:26:04] <rwaldron> that's a guess that I pulled out of my ass
[14:26:50] <Krinkle> But, it apparently assigns the parsed whole into to the "" property of a hidden object, and then it walks that, instead of walking the parsed whole only
[14:27:00] <Krinkle> I tried with arrays and primitive values as well, same result
[14:27:15] <Krinkle> it has an additional call with the response as a whole
[14:27:29] <Krinkle> it could be considered a feature to be able to replace the whole response but it's odd
[14:27:49] <Krinkle> and I can't find it in the spec, or am I missing it?
[14:30:41] <rwaldron> Krinkle it's done so that the result of JSON.parse itself isn't mutated
[14:30:47] <rwaldron> (IIRC)
[14:31:08] <rwaldron> Look at 4.A
[14:31:27] <rwaldron> it's similar to how Array.prototype methods generally create a new Array() internally
[14:31:40] <rwaldron> and make modifications there instead of actually modifying "this"
[14:31:48] <Krinkle> Ah "Call the [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal method of root with the empty String"
[14:32:10] <rwaldron> I have to bounce
[14:32:17] <rwaldron> I'll catch ya'lls later
[14:32:24] <Krinkle> It is indeed creating a private object with one key only and recursively walks that object

[15:05:33] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/78
[15:05:34] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #78 on testswarm (jzaefferer; 8m, 6d ago): Deal with non-stop browser releases (Chrome, Firefox)
[15:05:44] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Any specific method in mind?
[15:07:31] <Krinkle> http://superuser.com/questions/339573/how-can-i-tell-which-google-chrome-channel-im-running
[15:07:39] <Krinkle> it appear the user agent doesn't tell the channel
[15:07:51] <Krinkle> we'll probably have to keep track of it ourselves
[15:08:42] <Krinkle> Which is fine, we could even require testing in the previous version that way (and BrowserStack allows that easily with no additional overhead)
[15:09:44] <jzaefferer> Well, now that we can update the version much quicker, that is more of an option then before
[15:10:08] <jzaefferer> So basically we'd test against current and one or two previous releases, then update whenever a new one comes out?
[15:11:00] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I'm not sure if you know but useragents-ini does not feed the parser. If browscap does not know about chrome 19, putting [Chrome|19] won't do anything. useragents.ini is a categorization of browscap IDs not the other way around
[15:11:08] <Krinkle> yes
[15:12:02] <Krinkle> but with a little luck we (or at least I) will have push access to browscap, I'm trying to get the guy to put it on a public source that takes pull requests
[15:12:25] <Krinkle> preferably github but not perse
[15:12:26] <Krinkle> he is open to volunteer contributions
[15:12:48] <jzaefferer> okay
[15:16:06] <Krinkle> currently Chromium 6-19 is detected and Google Chrome 6-19
[15:16:16] <Krinkle> so we're good for now, in that we can do this without needing upstream changes, for now
[15:16:55] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: do you want to do it? (useragents.ini -Chrome; + Chrome 17/18/19)
[15:17:03] <Krinkle> and the right categories ofcourse
[15:20:35] <jzaefferer> Let's go with just one version back, so 18+19
[15:20:43] <Krinkle> ok
[15:24:24] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: btw, any blockers for a testing round of 1.0.0-pre on swarm.jquery.org? I'd like to have it running there at least for a week before we go rc/beta/release or whatever.
[15:25:19] <Krinkle> The only breaking change afaik is the entry point to addjob and the query parameter names
[15:25:19] <jzaefferer> Yeah, both BrowserStack and Jenkins integration need to be updated first. Not sure if Jenkins can still parse the markup, that would easy the transition
[15:25:52] <Krinkle> the extraction of job status can wait if need be since that's broken already (although depending on how it fails it may have to be fixed first)
[15:26:12] <Krinkle> it has changed for sute

[15:50:20] <jqcommit> [testswarm/master] Database.php minor fixes - Timo Tijhof
[15:50:20] <jqcommit> [testswarm/master] Add stats about CleanupAction in the response for CleanupAction - Timo Tijhof
[15:52:45] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I believe state=wipe is not being run, again.
[15:52:49] <Krinkle> on swarm.jquery.org
[15:53:07] <Krinkle> I just noticed a few being yellow for a long time and when I did state=wipe it was fixed
[15:53:10] <Krinkle> same again now with another job
[16:21:39] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: The guy from browscap responded positively last week about my proposal to make the repo public to make accepting patches easier (right now he just publishes the files on a public web server, overwriting the last one) - but he added that his previous experience with volunteers is that the idea is good but after they agree he wouldn't hear anything from them again
[16:22:01] <Krinkle> right now I feel the opposite, I explained him a bit about Github (as he requested), but haven't heard since Thursday
[16:23:16] <Krinkle> we could always fork the project though :P it's just an .ini file (public domain), and the phpbrowscap app just needs to be given a different url to pull from. But I'll give him another poke and a week time before I even consider that. It is his project and I don't intent to take it away :P
[16:23:47] <Krinkle> we could also (instead of formally forking it) just maintain our own copy of browscap.ini and pull in upstream changes periodically
[16:24:19] <Krinkle> anyway, right now we don't need any changes so no rush
[16:26:19] <jzaefferer> okay
[17:07:11] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: what's your availability this week? I can't do the java stuff myself (or at least hoping someone who has experience with it will do it so that I don't waste time on trying) for Jenkins.

[17:29:28] <mikesherov> do you have a moment for an opinion on something?
[17:29:36] <DaveMethvin> sure, it'll cost nothing
[17:29:44] <mikesherov> I know I lean on you a lot
[17:29:54] <DaveMethvin> i know i fall over a lot

[17:30:23] <bot-t> [#10067] Firing $.ready on document.readyState === 'interactive' too (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/10067
[17:30:28] <mikesherov> there we go
[17:30:49] <mikesherov> so um, I'm almost ready for a pull for this thing
[17:31:02] <DaveMethvin> how are you testing it?
[17:31:23] <mikesherov> IFRAME IN AN IFRAME
[17:31:28] <DaveMethvin> INCEPTION
[17:31:32] <mikesherov> LOL
[17:31:39] <mikesherov> so anyway, it works
[17:31:56] <mikesherov> the only thing is, that firing on interactive explicitly means that iframes on the page aren't gauranteed to have loaded
[17:32:12] <mikesherov> so I imagine that's an expectation more than a few users depend on, right?
[17:32:12] <DaveMethvin> ouch.
[17:32:20] <DaveMethvin> probably
[17:32:28] <DaveMethvin> that's what worried me about it
[17:32:33] <mikesherov> I mean, that's explicitly what this bug report is intending
[17:32:48] <mikesherov> I like it though, it would actually be super useful for the internet
[17:33:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah i can imagine times when it would be VERY nice
[17:33:00] <mikesherov> think of all the pages that load ads that take a while to load
[17:33:11] <DaveMethvin> like for all those social network iframes you don't give a crap about loading
[17:33:17] <mikesherov> RIGHT
[17:33:22] <DaveMethvin> BUT
[17:33:22] <mikesherov> My app specifically would benefit from this
[17:33:27] <DaveMethvin> it's a big behavior change i think
[17:33:32] <mikesherov> so, I was thinking, have an option
[17:34:10] <DaveMethvin> WE MUST BIKESHED THE NAME!
[17:34:23] <mikesherov> HAHA
[17:34:30] <DaveMethvin> hmm, normally i don't like global options
[17:34:39] <DaveMethvin> i still don't but i agree this would be useful
[17:34:44] <mikesherov> I don't care what the name is, but I'm wondering what you think the API should look like
[17:35:00] <DaveMethvin> well it has to be called early
[17:35:03] <DaveMethvin> or set
[17:35:09] <mikesherov> Right
[17:35:20] <DaveMethvin> <evil grin>
[17:35:31] <mikesherov> but just having that level of control is a huge win
[17:35:42] <DaveMethvin> jQuery.holdReady("lightly")
[17:35:48] <mikesherov> haha
[17:36:00] <mikesherov> do you think it's a call to holdReady?
[17:36:15] <DaveMethvin> no but wouldn't that be fun
[17:36:27] <DaveMethvin> really it's kind of similar, trying to define when ready should fire
[17:36:48] <DaveMethvin> but i don't think i could sleep at night if we overloaded that somehow
[17:36:52] <mikesherov> HAHA
[17:36:54] <mikesherov> Agreed
[17:37:21] <mikesherov> I was thinking jQuery.interactiveReady
[17:37:27] <mikesherov> clearly I shouldn't be allowed to name things
[17:37:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah a variable should be fine
[17:37:48] <DaveMethvin> minimum api surface
[17:37:51] <DaveMethvin> something simple
[17:38:00] <DaveMethvin> jQuery.goAhead
[17:38:01] <DaveMethvin> lol
[17:38:31] <DaveMethvin> but anyway, i don't think we can land it as a default
[17:38:41] <DaveMethvin> it would have to be a feature you opted into
[17:38:58] <mikesherov> sure, agreed
[17:39:01] <mikesherov> absolutely
[17:39:18] <DaveMethvin> damn it woudl be nice if we could though
[17:39:47] <mikesherov> it would save the internet so much time
[17:40:08] <DaveMethvin> i mean, people who use jQuery to reach into other iframes make me sad
[17:40:11] <mikesherov> think of all the iframes on most pages
[17:40:12] <DaveMethvin> it's such a corner case
[17:40:20] <mikesherov> sure, but it exists
[17:40:42] <mikesherov> and you know, we can always shout about the option, and in some future version change the default if we like
[17:40:47] <DaveMethvin> how about jQuery.quickReady?
[17:40:51] <mikesherov> for 1.8, introducing the option is enough
[17:40:56] <mikesherov> I like quickReady
[17:40:59] <mikesherov> I'm using it
[17:41:22] <DaveMethvin> i agree, let's evangelize ppl using quickReady=false if they need to wait for iframes
[17:41:33] <mikesherov> awesome
[17:41:35] <DaveMethvin> and then we can switch the default at some point
[17:41:39] <mikesherov> yup
[17:42:10] <mikesherov> ok, thanks for the help... I'm back to whipping this up.
[17:42:17] <DaveMethvin> sweet!
[17:42:26] <mikesherov> yeah, I'm excited about it

[19:00:41] <Krinkle> lol
[19:16:04] <Krinkle> Anyone here maybe know what's going on with IE6 vs jQuery UI Effects module test suite?
[19:16:15] <Krinkle> seems up until last week its been passing/failing at random
[19:16:22] <Krinkle> and as of this week that suite won't run at all
[19:16:26] <Krinkle> crashing IE6
[19:16:29] <Krinkle> everytime
[19:16:37] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jqueryui/
[19:16:50] <Krinkle> effects.core: createWrapper and removeWrapper retain focused elements (#7595) (2, 0, 2)
[19:18:16] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle: hmmm, when did the random fails start?
[19:18:33] <Krinkle> Can't tell, swarm was reset a few weeks back
[19:18:46] <Krinkle> its been like this since the start
[19:19:03] <Krinkle> - <input> +<body>
[19:19:03] <DaveMethvin> just wondering, we've  had issues getting core unit tests to run reliably on ie6 as well
[19:19:23] <Krinkle> btw, a recent revision made all browsers fail
[19:19:29] <Krinkle> not related to ui/ie6

[19:19:49] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/32/
[19:19:52] <Krinkle> selectors
[19:19:56] <Krinkle> started in 31
[19:20:11] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i think it was the addition of an object tag in the html
[19:20:35] <DaveMethvin> but i ran the tests locally, so its off to clear every damn cache to be sure
[19:21:45] <DaveMethvin> yep
[19:22:28] <Krinkle> the swarm tests run from a unique url each test, so can't be a cache issue there
[19:22:35] <Krinkle> the commit hash is included in all repo files, and a timestamp is included in all dynamic files
[19:23:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's always the local caching that gets me

[19:25:07] <Krinkle> We should have the Jenkins plugin make those type of comments automatically
[19:25:11] <Krinkle> should be doable
[19:25:24] <DaveMethvin> that could be handy
[19:25:27] <Krinkle> it has all the information (except for the test/assertion name maybe)

[19:32:29] <Krinkle> yay
[19:32:31] <Krinkle> figured it'd be that simple
[19:33:05] <DaveMethvin> let's see how jenkins feels about it
[19:33:59] <Krinkle> Jenkins will report STIL FAILING as usual
[19:34:08] <Krinkle> since it checks the status in a broken way
[19:34:22] <Krinkle> but testswarm will hopefully feel good about it :)
[19:34:53] <DaveMethvin> well at least jenkins gives me the link so i can be lazy

[19:35:08] <Krinkle> hha
