[14:31:54] <tbranyen> elijahmanor: hey man if you come around i got a question for ya
[17:34:24] <Krinkle> Hi, was wondering what devs think about this: http://www.codedodger.com/2011/06/jquery-type-and-custom-types/
[17:34:29] <Krinkle> useful for jQuery core ? Or not.
[17:34:41] <Krinkle> It was some suggests for a better $.type
[17:35:09] <Krinkle> I'm not sure if it should return non-standard types
[17:37:07] <Krinkle> Fixing NaN being type number would be nice though
[17:37:13] <Krinkle> perhaps just that part ?
