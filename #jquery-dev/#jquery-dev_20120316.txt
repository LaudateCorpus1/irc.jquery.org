[02:22:32] <jzaefferer> olavk: cool stuff! Looks like you are indeed familiar with xslt :-)
[03:01:44] <olavk> jzaefferer: Thank you! So...should I send a pull request?
[03:07:23] <jzaefferer> olavk: yes you should - even if we don't merge that instantly, it helps reviewing and improving things
[03:14:46] <olavk> jzaefferer: OK, done. I suspect my xslt is not totally idiomatic.
[03:28:08] <Flo0815> hi
[03:29:17] <Flo0815> i hope i'm in the right channel for my problem. if not please tell me
[03:30:00] <Flo0815> if have a plugin written by luciano panaro called fxQueues
[03:30:27] <Flo0815> it seems that he has stop developing this plugin since 2008 and i can't contact him, so thats why i'm asking u guys
[03:31:43] <Flo0815> and this plugin runs only with jQuery 1.3
[03:31:57] <Flo0815> i need to queue animations. Some of them have to run sequentially some of them parallel
[03:32:18] <Flo0815> it's like a video with animations in it, a timeline and a play/pause button
[03:43:18] <Flo0815> ...is anybody here?
[04:58:13] <scott_gonzalez> Flo0815: That's a question for #jquery
[05:33:03] <mikesherov> .
[05:33:42] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: you here?
[05:33:53] <scott_gonzalez> hey mikesherov
[05:34:26] <mikesherov> so, I ran into something funny that might affect mobile, and I wanted you ropinion
[05:34:43] <mikesherov> I was working on this ticket: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11441
[05:35:15] <mikesherov> which affects safari 5.0 and lower, which technically jQuery core no longer supports
[05:36:07] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[05:36:24] <mikesherov> I did a bug fix for 1.7.2 which exposed frailty in a bunch of the support tests that have page level div css
[05:36:33] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't realize we treated dot versions as major versions for Safari.
[05:36:35] <mikesherov> one of the effected tests is reliableMarginRight
[05:36:41] <scott_gonzalez> I thought we were still on 4+ :-P
[05:36:54] <mikesherov> according to rwaldron, we do
[05:37:05] <scott_gonzalez> I thought we only did that for Opera now.
[05:37:14] <mikesherov> he's talking 0.0.X as versions
[05:37:37] <mikesherov> and even if 0.X is a version, that would mean 5.0 and 5.q
[05:37:42] <mikesherov> 5.1*
[05:37:42] <scott_gonzalez> Right, I thought we only did that for Opera (and old Firefox, which no longer follows that pattern)
[05:37:52] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, wait.
[05:37:57] <mikesherov> Yeah, I'm not sure
[05:38:08] <scott_gonzalez> There's no way we treat 5.0.0 and 5.0.1 and current and current - 1
[05:38:26] <mikesherov> ok, so that makes the rest of my convo moot
[05:38:38] <mikesherov> but can I explore the question anyway?
[05:38:51] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[05:38:53] <mikesherov> lets say we did only support 5.1.2 and 5.1.4 now
[05:39:36] <mikesherov> reliableMarginRight is not true in all supported browsers... should the support test be removed?
[05:39:47] <mikesherov> If the answer is yes, I know mobile might still want it
[05:39:52] <scott_gonzalez> s/not/now/?
[05:40:01] <mikesherov> yes
[05:40:25] <scott_gonzalez> The second that a support test is no longer needed by core, it's supposed to be removed.
[05:40:36] <scott_gonzalez> So that answers your question.
[05:40:45] <scott_gonzalez> BUT, I don't think that's the case.
[05:40:56] <scott_gonzalez> I can't imagine us saying that 5.1.x and 5.1.x are current and current - 1.
[05:41:11] <mikesherov> and cssHooks are extensible enough that if mobile wants it, they can duckpunch it in
[05:41:34] <scott_gonzalez> It probably affects UI too.
[05:41:44] <mikesherov> Me neither... should I bring it up to the ML?
[05:41:56] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[05:42:06] <mikesherov> ok
[05:42:20] <scott_gonzalez> I thought it was M.x.x for Chrome, Firefox, Safari and x.M.x for Opera.
[05:42:45] <scott_gonzalez> And x.M.x for old Firefox, which is now limited to 3.6 specifically so it doesn't matter (or did we drop that already)?
[05:42:53] <mikesherov> I have note tested in 4+ for any of the work I do
[05:42:55] <scott_gonzalez> Where old = <4
[05:43:04] <mikesherov> I do 5.0 and 5.1
[05:43:19] <scott_gonzalez> I could see x.M.x for Safari considering their release rate.
[05:43:25] <mikesherov> http://docs.jquery.com/Browser_Compatibility
[05:43:28] <scott_gonzalez> And they do semi-automatic updates, right?
[05:43:37] <scott_gonzalez> Through System Update.
[05:43:43] <mikesherov> well they popup that apple software updater
[05:43:47] <mikesherov> on windows
[05:44:27] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, Safari on Windows, that's like old Mac IE :-P
[05:46:08] <scott_gonzalez> I could see us supporting 5.0.x and 5.1.x.
[05:46:17] <mikesherov> i test safari on windows and on mac
[05:46:26] <mikesherov> but my actual work comp is windows
[05:46:36] <mikesherov> so that's where I see the update process
[05:47:04] <scott_gonzalez> People are going to be pretty current on OS X.
[05:47:15] <mikesherov> OK, I'll hit up the ML... damn! And here I thought I was going to be able to remove a support test!
[05:47:39] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[05:47:57] <scott_gonzalez> Once this is all settled, we need to document what we mean by current -1 for each browser on that support page.
[05:48:09] <mikesherov> yup
[05:49:04] <scott_gonzalez> According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_version_history Safari 4.0 is when it first passed Acid 3 :-)
[05:49:07] <mikesherov> jquery.com says 5.0+
[05:49:45] <scott_gonzalez> That sounds reasonable.
[05:49:51] <mikesherov> yeah
[05:50:05] <mikesherov> I wonder what the market share is
[05:51:34] <mikesherov> let's see what google analytics say for my app's visitors..
[05:53:13] <scott_gonzalez> Safari is 6%
[05:53:51] <scott_gonzalez> 534.x is ~75%
[05:54:09] <scott_gonzalez> 535.x is 1.5%
[05:54:31] <scott_gonzalez> 533.x is 6%
[05:54:47] <mikesherov> 534 is which version
[05:55:01] <mikesherov> gimme a map!
[05:55:28] <scott_gonzalez> 534 = 5.1, 533 = 5.0, 535 = ?
[05:55:36] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe nightlines
[05:55:40] <scott_gonzalez> *nightlies
[05:56:16] <mikesherov> k
[05:56:19] <mikesherov> thanks
[05:56:24] <scott_gonzalez> 531.x (4.x) is <1% of all Safari visits.
[05:56:36] <scott_gonzalez> So pretty tiny, since Safari is only 6% of visits
[05:57:16] <mikesherov> right, I have similar
[05:57:23] <mikesherov> 78% on 5.1
[05:58:03] <scott_gonzalez> Is there a way to group by major version?
[05:58:05] <mikesherov> but safari makes up 2% of my traffic
[05:58:37] <scott_gonzalez> There are 154 Safari versions listed :-/
[05:58:40] <mikesherov> on desktop*
[05:58:49] <mikesherov> Yeah, I have about that
[05:59:35] <mikesherov> so let's conservatively call safari 5%
[06:00:09] <mikesherov> 10% of that is .5%
[06:00:34] <scott_gonzalez> 1% is .05% :-P That's Safari 4 usage.
[06:01:00] <mikesherov> right, so I'm going to go the ML with this
[06:01:05] <mikesherov> Thanks for your help man
[06:01:11] <scott_gonzalez> No problem.
[06:01:18] <mikesherov> if we do remove reliableMarginRight, I'll let you know
[06:01:31] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[06:01:34] <mikesherov> np

[09:41:44] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by spartan-developer (9m, 32s ago): Changed hover() (and it's unit test) to optionally accept an object with 'over' and 'out' properties
[09:44:59] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez haha
[09:45:07] <danheberden> i saw that and stopped reading at 'coffeescript'
[09:45:22] <danheberden> because I HATE FREEDOMS

[09:46:21] <scott_gonzalez> That's what's linked to from the PR.
[09:49:33] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm..Dave's alive just avoiding IRC?
[09:56:29] <jaubourg> I think he's ultra busy these days, something to do with being on the road
[09:57:28] <Flo0815> hey guys, can someone please tell me why this plugin doesn't work with jquery 1.7? -> http://jsfiddle.net/xZT8M/
[09:57:42] <Flo0815> works only with jq1.3
[10:00:06] <danheberden> Flo0815 that's a question for #jquery
[10:00:25] <Flo0815> i tried it the whole week, noone can help me there
[10:01:18] <danheberden> it's a pretty daunting question - 'why don't these tons of lines of code work?'
[10:01:45] <Flo0815> i treid to solve it myself, but i'm getting mad bout this
[10:02:15] <Flo0815> and i'm very good in developing or bugfixing plugins
[10:02:44] <Flo0815> there must be something which existed in v1.3 but in v1.7 not anymore
[10:07:30] <ajpiano> the fact that this literally replaces the existing $.fn.animate makes me very suspicious
[10:08:17] <Flo0815> i think it just rewrites the whole function
[10:08:23] <ajpiano> it calls the old one
[10:08:25] <ajpiano> sometimes.
[10:09:10] <ajpiano> off the top of my head i don't know enough about what may have changed in the queue/animation stuff internally to make this not work
[10:10:14] <Flo0815> ok, nvm, i continue on monday
[10:10:17] <Flo0815> have a nice weekend
