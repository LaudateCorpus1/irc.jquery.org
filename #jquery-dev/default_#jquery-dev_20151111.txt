[07:50:07] <scott_gonzalez> Guest70517: Thanks. It's been reported to the infrastructure team.
[09:45:02] <markelog> m_gol: hey, you there?
[09:45:13] <markelog> is this a behaviour change right - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1724?

[10:56:15] <m_gol> markelog: sorry, I was afk
[10:56:25] <m_gol> markelog: yeah, definitely
[10:56:40] <m_gol> I added the label now
[10:56:42] <markelog> np, cool, so i did the right thing :-)
[10:58:11] <m_gol> markelog: how is the second strategy going?
[10:58:35] <markelog> http://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/63596751.jpg
[11:01:29] <m_gol> markelog: but... worse conflicts or easier ones? ;p
[11:02:36] <markelog> i guess worse, but now i'm more thorough
[11:03:01] <markelog> like
[11:03:04] <markelog> for example
[11:03:06] <markelog> this commit https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/b60b26e18477d21fa5ec9c6572e114fc5d441730
[11:03:15] <markelog> should be all good
[11:03:27] <markelog> but since we know use assert.equal instead of just equal
[11:03:33] <markelog> it conflicts
[11:03:42] <markelog> source code too
[11:03:45] <markelog> for some reason
[11:08:05] <m_gol> markelog I guess if we knew about the change of plans we'd wait with such changes until after 1.12/2.2 :-)
[11:08:19] <m_gol> lots of trivial commits generating conflicts when reverting
[11:08:26] <m_gol> * commits -> changes
[11:09:56] <markelog> yeah, "If i know where i would fall, i would put a bed there" :-)
[11:10:06] <m_gol> :)
[11:10:43] <m_gol> markelog: one interesting consequence of having 1.12-stable be based on compat with reverted commits is that we could remove the compat branch later on
[11:10:48] <m_gol> since no commits would get lost
[11:11:10] <m_gol> if those were completely separate branches then I'd like to keep compat, maybe renamed to compat-archived or sth like that
