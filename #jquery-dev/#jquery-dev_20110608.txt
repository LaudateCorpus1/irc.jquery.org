[00:24:17] <JKarsrud> eckko: ask in #jquery

[08:40:37] <kswedberg> .
[09:04:26] <jzaefferer> jQuery UI meeting now starting in irc://rocketsquared.com:7666/#jquery-meeting
[09:08:42] <timmywil> .
[09:37:56] <kflorence> .
[09:46:52] <scott_gonzalez> adoven: can you hop into #jquery-meeting?
[09:48:43] <adoven> yeah, it was asking me for a password
[09:49:05] <jzaefferer> that's odd
[09:49:11] <adoven> i'm using irssi
[09:49:34] <adoven> let me just download mirc real quick
[09:49:36] <jzaefferer> there's also #jqueryui-dev
[09:49:54] <gnarf> adoven: are you registered with nickserv?
[09:50:11] <adoven> on freenode?
[09:50:18] <gnarf> yeah
[09:50:18] <ajpiano> jquery-meeting isn't +r
[09:50:40] <gnarf> hrm - i dunno why you can't join then...
[10:24:45] <borismoore_> Lost my connection just now
[10:25:06] <jzaefferer> also wrong channel :-)
[10:25:18] <borismoore_> Oh right!
[11:03:15] <wkmanire> Howdy folks.
[11:03:17] <scott_gonzalez> so .prop( "disabled" ) = boolean, .attr( "disabled" ) = undefined or string?
[11:07:09] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez tbh, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the changes
[11:07:22] <rwaldron> and apparently, timmywil isnt around at the moment
[11:07:24] <rwaldron> sorry bro
[11:07:34] <scott_gonzalez> it's ok, I just RTFM and it told me
[11:07:51] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think there's a clean way to handle multiple version of jQuery now
[11:08:15] <scott_gonzalez> not sure how we're going to land support for jQuery 1.6 in jQuery UI 1.8.x
[11:08:18] <rwaldron> :\
[11:08:20] <scott_gonzalez> unless we create wrappers
[11:08:41] <rwaldron> it bums me out to be the only one in here to read this right now
[11:08:54] <gnarf> im here to read it too
[11:08:56] <rwaldron> it also bums me out that i know exactly why you're in this position
[11:08:59] <rwaldron> hi gnarf
[11:09:02] <rwaldron> <3
[11:09:58] <scott_gonzalez> maybe we just won't support 1.6.x in UI 1.8.x
[11:10:04] <scott_gonzalez> it's just gonna be a while before 1.9 lands
[11:10:11] <gnarf> but now i need to walk into "work"
[11:10:17] <gnarf> bbiab
[11:10:21] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez I actually started working on a back-compat plugin
[11:10:27] <rwaldron> earlier this week
[11:11:12] <danheberden> rwaldron - https://github.com/rwldrn/jquery/commit/afc05e01b973127e7ffdacbab88cdcefd4691e7e, i love that you alphabetized the props
[11:11:32] <rwaldron> danheberden i love that you cared enough to tell me :)
[11:15:53] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez hrm apparently i didnt get too far
[11:15:55] <rwaldron> http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/9w2FU/
[11:16:08] <rwaldron> seems i did some setup, then... nothing?
[11:16:20] <rwaldron> but the fiddle's title is "attr back-compat plugin"
[11:16:34] * rwaldron shrugs
[11:16:53] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[11:17:07] <scott_gonzalez> I'll see how many attributes we actually need to normalize against
[11:17:09] <rwaldron> clearly i found something else more interesting
[11:17:16] <scott_gonzalez> might just make a helper method or two
[11:18:13] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez line 9 of attributes.js
[11:18:15] <rwaldron> rboolean = /^(?:autofocus|autoplay|async|checked|controls|defer|disabled|hidden|loop|multiple|open|readonly|required|scoped|selected)$/i,
[11:18:58] <rwaldron> is used to re-route requests from within attr
[11:19:01] <rwaldron> to boolHook
[11:19:26] <rwaldron> which seems to add get/set wrappers around prop() calls
[11:19:27] <scott_gonzalez> that might be all we need to handle
[11:19:34] <rwaldron> hope that helps
[11:19:38] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, I think it will
[11:19:39] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[11:19:46] <rwaldron> you're welcome :)
[11:20:03] <scott_gonzalez> do you happen to know what happens with other booleans?
[11:20:09] <scott_gonzalez> like aria-pressed
[11:20:21] <scott_gonzalez> any idea if it's ok to continue using .attr() for that?
[11:23:00] <gnarf> couldn't UI 1.8 just provide $.fn.prop if it doesn't exist? normalize the access method?
[14:06:24] <tbranyen> is it possible to write a deferred for document ready?
[14:06:28] <tbranyen> not having much luck here
[14:12:17] <wkmanire> tbranyen: That seems like it would be reasonable. You tried var d = $( document ).ready( /* snip */ );  d.done( /* some function */ ); ?
[14:12:56] <tbranyen> wkmanire: yeah turns out my issue was really lame xD
[14:13:02] <wkmanire> oh ok.
[14:13:03] <tbranyen> i wasn't executing the function containing my deferred
[14:13:08] <tbranyen> so i was just passing the function wrapper reference
[14:13:11] <tbranyen> instead of the deferred
[14:13:18] <wkmanire> :D
[14:43:38] <rworth> kborchers: they are indeed reversed
[14:44:02] <rworth> (wrong channel)
