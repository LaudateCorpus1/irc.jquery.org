[06:07:43] <timmywil> ajpiano: #jquery-meeting is open right now.  which mode is for downtime?
[06:08:57] <timmywil> or gnarf
[06:12:40] <timmywil> ah nvm, set mode m
[07:47:33] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: concerning https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/570, I'm with you, but would we get better performance by adding hasOwn checks in our for in's?
[07:47:33] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by LeonFedotov (16h, 54m ago): Trying to fix bug #10642
[07:48:10] <DaveMethvin> i don't think so, it would be more code to run, right?
[07:48:21] <DaveMethvin> lots of for/in within our own code
[07:48:32] <timmywil> or save running through the prototype unnecessarily
[07:48:46] <timmywil> which is why in is so slow
[07:49:25] <DaveMethvin> i think we'd want to look through all the places we use for/in and determine the impact
[07:49:50] <timmywil> i think this is wise http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/#object.forinloop
[07:49:56] <DaveMethvin> it doesn't make sense to just fix one or two, the unfixed ones will eventually cause issues
[07:50:02] <timmywil> oh absolutely
[07:50:48] <DaveMethvin> we could always try it, but i think we'd want to be sure it didn't kill performance
[07:51:01] <timmywil> true
[07:51:16] <miketaylr> i remember phiggins telling me hasOwnProperty is too slow to use in libs
[07:51:36] <miketaylr> which seems unintuitive
[07:51:46] <miketaylr> i think SlexAxton was there
[07:52:44] <DaveMethvin> the main places we use for/in is to enumerate maps, and in those cases we're assuming it's a bare Object
[07:53:11] <DaveMethvin> the only exception i can think of offhand is in data.js where we did that isEmptyDataObject hack
[07:53:24] <DaveMethvin> or was that in isEmptyObject, lemme look
[07:53:37] <timmywil> well, I can make a ticket and explore whether it would help or hinder
[07:54:30] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[07:54:35] <DaveMethvin> isPlainObject was the one
[07:54:46] <miketaylr> timmywil: is matchesSelector bad for perf? just saw your comment on the oMatchesSelector ticket
[07:55:41] <DaveMethvin> and isEmptyDataObject https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/data.js#L346
[07:56:56] <DaveMethvin> miketaylr:  paul_irish had an issue about querySelectorAll in the standards area and i think it applies to matchesSelector as well ... they're not as fast as we might expect
[07:57:30] <DaveMethvin> and of course we expect them to be blazingly fast :D
[07:57:37] <miketaylr> cool, i'd love to see the perf results
[07:57:42] <miketaylr> stupid slow native apis
[07:58:50] <DaveMethvin> miketaylr: https://github.com/jquery/standards/issues/4
[07:58:51] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4 on standards, reported by paulirish (1w, 6d ago): querySelectorAll is Often Surprisingly Slow
[07:59:46] <DaveMethvin> but addyosmani gave Opera a gold star for effort in his comment there
[08:01:08] <miketaylr> so the issue is qSA is slower than gEBTN, etc
[08:01:14] <miketaylr> not shocking
[08:02:35] <DaveMethvin> well the orders of magnitude in some browsers is definitely shocking
[08:02:48] <DaveMethvin> given that the simple cases could be checked and dispatched with ease
[08:03:28] <miketaylr> NOOBS
[08:03:33] <miketaylr> oh, my talk is up
[08:03:34] <miketaylr> bbl
[08:12:10] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: did you see docs#10647 ?
[08:12:28] <DaveMethvin> oh bot-t i am disappoint
[08:12:34] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10647
[08:15:26] <DaveMethvin> lol @ kswedberg1 <code>
[08:15:49] <kswedberg1> :) oops!
[08:25:53] <SlexAxton> alot of our loop use jQuery.each
[08:26:11] <SlexAxton> so it doesn't pick up prototype properties
[08:38:43] <jaubourg> plop
[08:39:07] <addyosmani> pop
[08:42:07] <jaubourg> addy: got a link to the $.Callbacks docs? ;)
[08:42:46] <jaubourg> (saw you wrote about something already written if you see what I mean)
[08:46:00] <addyosmani> Oh right
[08:46:14] <addyosmani> they're all saved in draft atm jaubourg
[08:46:26] <addyosmani> we haven't published yet. Waiting on Dave/Karl to review
[08:46:49] <addyosmani> If you could give them a lookover that would be appreciated :)
[08:56:35] <jaubourg> what's the url for the api admin again ?
[09:02:39] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: that actually passes for me in ff 3.6
[09:03:04] <DaveMethvin> well good, i have no idea what he's talking about
[09:03:30] <DaveMethvin> usually we get a description without a test case, but this was a test case without a description
[09:03:44] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: api.jquery.com/wp-admin
[09:04:04] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: well, first off, it wasn't using jQuery edge
[09:04:10] <DaveMethvin> btw jaubourg i added the changes you mentioned this morning, thanks for pointing them out
[09:04:36] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: i didn't have 3.6 to test here so i got lazy and punted to you :)
[09:04:51] <timmywil> heh, np
[09:16:10] <jaubourg> Dave: seriously, thank YOU guys for putting up with my absence as of late
[09:16:21] <jaubourg> life's crazy these days
[09:16:41] <addyosmani> you getting a chance to enjoy some of it? :)
[09:17:19] <jaubourg> yeah, despite the fact I was dead sick when I got back to Brussels
[09:18:01] <jaubourg> oh, I saw there was no call for speakers for jqcon London?
[09:18:10] <jaubourg> or am I missing something?
[09:19:25] <addyosmani> jaubourg...I emailed you about it when we were getting speakers together :(
[09:19:36] <addyosmani> or, I asked them to email you
[09:20:02] <jaubourg> I didn't see anything in my inbox but heh, no biggy, I would have loved to talk there though
[09:20:36] <addyosmani> I'll talk to the organizers. If they haven't totally finalized everything I'll see whats possible
[09:20:36] <jaubourg> timmywil, DaveMethvin: so no more pre-domreadyness test due to IE8?
[09:20:41] <jaubourg> in support
[09:20:54] <addyosmani> speaking of which..I'll be in Belgium next week onwards. Will have to catch you and Steve for a drink :)
[09:21:10] <jaubourg> coolness, you still have my number right?
[09:21:17] <timmywil> jaubourg: we're going to dig into it more in 1.7.1, but for now we needed to prevent crashes in ie8
[09:21:25] <addyosmani> yep yep
[09:21:33] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: based on all the probs we 've had it would be good to look at that again in support.js
[09:21:37] <jaubourg> timmywil: so long for my fake good idea :P
[09:21:53] <timmywil> jaubourg: i think we can do a mixture
[09:22:03] <DaveMethvin> HELP MY BODY IS DETACHED!
[09:22:06] <timmywil> some tests we attach to the body don't actually require a body
[09:22:30] <DaveMethvin> also if that one ticket is accurate there is a significant delay (100ms!) in doing the position tesets
[09:22:46] <DaveMethvin> going back to lazy-on-demand might be a good idea
[09:23:03] <timmywil> the ones that do should probably be deferred until doc ready, but we still could create a fake body for docs that don't have a body at doc ready
[09:23:03] <jaubourg> heh, saw that, but it seems like a profiling tool gone mad to me
[09:23:07] <timmywil> like framesets
[09:23:32] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: that wasn't a position test
[09:23:46] <jaubourg> it's the in operator right?
[09:23:49] <DaveMethvin> oh right, and that was in 1.6.4
[09:23:57] <DaveMethvin> i think lemme look at the ticket
[09:24:06] <jaubourg> 100ms seems a bit much to me
[09:24:13] <DaveMethvin> owaitaminit i need to finish something here
[09:24:22] <timmywil> it's the "zoom" in style
[09:24:34] <timmywil> which loops through a ton of crap
[09:25:59] <jaubourg> maybe even stalls a bit because dom is not ready yet or something
[09:27:16] <DaveMethvin> ok,done
[09:27:37] <timmywil> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10644
[09:27:41] <DaveMethvin> so jaubourg you feeling better?
[09:28:35] <jaubourg> yeah, I'm better now thank god ;)
[09:28:41] <DaveMethvin> i don't want to release 1.7 until you're healthy :D
[09:28:46] <jaubourg> hahaha
[09:29:10] <jaubourg> I'm good, no need to delay jauQuery
[09:29:12] <timmywil> oh jaubourg, have you had a chance to look at that opera ajax fail?
[09:29:19] <timmywil> haha
[09:29:22] <jaubourg> timmy: yes and Opera sucks
[09:29:45] <timmywil> "jauQuery"
[09:29:53] <DaveMethvin> tell it to miketaylr when he's around
[09:29:57] <jaubourg> I didn't say that out loud, did I? :P
[09:30:14] <jaubourg> I want to make this xhr test suite to end the madness for good
[09:30:24] <DaveMethvin> oh no, jaubourg's illness has exposed his inner dialog
[09:30:30] <jaubourg> I hope to pass it to browser vendors
[09:30:52] <jaubourg> called it the "XHR no non-sense test suite"
[09:31:13] <jaubourg> it's for pretty much everything the spec doesn't provide
[09:31:42] <jaubourg> need to get time to do it right
[09:31:48] <DaveMethvin> btw i think we could release the 1.7 hounds this afternoon? No big probs so far but let's give ppl a few more hours
[09:32:02] <jaubourg> so, custom status texts, some cors stuff, filesystem handling, stuff like that
[09:36:38] <jaubourg> timmywil: so anyway, we can just bypass the test for Opera for now
[09:37:09] <jaubourg> seems like custom statusText makes Opera's xhr crazy
[09:38:57] <miketaylr> is there an opera bug filed?
[09:40:39] <DaveMethvin> miketaylr: i thought bitching to you WAS filing a bug :P
[09:41:00] <miketaylr> NOOBS
[09:41:01] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: didn't safari or some other have the same issue? i know we skipped someone
[09:41:27] <DaveMethvin> remember, you fixed with a jQuery.browser (holds nose)
[09:41:30] <miketaylr> scumbag dev complains aboug bugs, doesn't file bugs
[09:41:33] <miketaylr> :P
[09:41:35] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:42:05] <miketaylr> jaubourg: someone is working on XHR2 right now, so it's a good time to get an XHR bug looked at
[09:42:16] <miketaylr> if you want to file and ping me with the #, i'll point them at it
[09:42:46] <jaubourg> mike: I need to make the minimal test case, I'll have a fiddle ready
[09:43:01] <jaubourg> thanks, as usual ;)
[09:43:03] <miketaylr> great!
[09:43:08] * miketaylr goes to lunch
[09:43:22] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: the safari issue seems different.  It doesn't make sense to me how Opera gets 'error' in the statusText
[09:43:45] <DaveMethvin> miketaylr: http://i.imgur.com/JxM8a.jpg
[09:43:50] <jaubourg> safari just overrides the statusText
[09:43:56] <miketaylr> haha DaveMethvin
[09:43:58] <miketaylr> bbiab
[09:44:22] <jaubourg> apparently, Opera passes into some kind of network error state (from what I quickly gathered, mind you)
[09:44:27] <jaubourg> status 0 all in a sudden
[09:44:41] <DaveMethvin> well i think the moral of the story is that we can't trust the text coming back
[09:45:06] <jaubourg> it is, but since we propagate the statusText, we still need some sort of test
[09:45:15] <jaubourg> sadly
[09:45:20] <DaveMethvin> oic now
[09:45:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah a pain
[09:45:49] <jaubourg> that's why I had them "standardized" but people relied on them custom statusText (it's valid from a spec point of view)
[09:47:51] <jaubourg> safe test workaround for now would be to have the test work if status is zeroed
[09:47:56] <timmywil> brb lunch
[10:06:22] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin, timmywil: use 403 instead seems to work
[10:06:36] <jaubourg> apparently, the problem lies with 404
[10:11:07] <jaubourg> In stand corrected, 403 doesn't work either :/
[10:11:32] <jaubourg> oh well, I'll post the bug as is
[10:28:59] <jaubourg> ?tell miketaylr DSK-349583@bugs.opera.com I have no clue how to watch the bug
[10:29:00] <bot-t> jaubourg, Okay.
[10:31:11] <jaubourg> seriously, why on earth can't I look at Opera bugs without a username and password, so so so so so lame
[11:11:58] <ajpiano> just for reference guys
[11:12:02] <ajpiano> i just used toLowerCase
[11:12:05] <ajpiano> and it work great!!!
[11:12:23] <ajpiano> reports of it not work good are highly exaggerated
[11:15:35] <Rwhitbeck> HAHAHA
[11:22:16] <rwaldron> ajpiano +9001
[11:22:20] <rwaldron> it's pretty solid
[11:22:40] <timmywil> ajpiano: lies!
[11:56:55] <rwaldron> dudes
[11:57:10] <rwaldron> timmywil ajpiano gnarf http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:array_extras
[11:57:14] <rwaldron> :D!!!!!!
[11:58:46] <timmywil> rwaldron: nice!
[12:01:18] <rwaldron> I'm stoke
[12:01:19] <rwaldron> stoked*
[12:01:30] <rwaldron> next step, we're going to draft the production steps
[12:07:16] <rwaldron> timmywil dig this...
[12:07:17] <rwaldron> http://jsperf.com/reading-offsetwidth
[12:07:29] <rwaldron> I don't know if that's actually working correctly
[12:07:43] <rwaldron> since all setup code is localized now...
[12:08:11] <rwaldron> but I actually wanted you to see the side effect
[12:08:15] <rwaldron> look at the time diffs
[12:08:25] <rwaldron> shit, did they not save?
[12:08:33] <rwaldron> oh, there they are...
[12:09:15] <timmywil> im not sure i see the problem.  v8 does a lot of things faster than jaeger
[12:09:52] <timmywil> but you're saying maybe chrome's is predefined and ff calls a function to calculate?
[12:10:36] <rwaldron> naw
[12:10:53] <rwaldron> one sec
[12:11:10] <rwaldron> wanna make sure an element "div" actually exists
[12:21:13] <rwaldron> timmywil wow http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10537
[12:25:10] <DaveMethvin> i'll submit a patch for jQuery.error: function(msg){ window.alert("YOU GOT A PROBLEM: "+msg); }
[12:25:17] <DaveMethvin> of course, now they have TWO problems
[12:28:51] <timmywil> i responded
[12:39:02] <timmywil> Fail dom monster: "You are using the jQuery JavaScript framework v1.6.4. There's a newer version available, which potentially includes performance updates."
[12:44:11] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: where that is?
[12:45:01] <timmywil> fuchs page analyzer http://mir.aculo.us/dom-monster/
[12:45:16] <timmywil> i check it out every once and while
[12:45:24] <timmywil> told me i should update from 1.6.4 tho
[12:45:38] <timmywil> i know it FEELS like 1.7 is out
[12:53:59] <DaveMethvin> hey i have an idea, lemme get started on putting 1.7 out ... timmywil gnarf rwaldron jaubourg you guys good with that?
[12:55:17] <DaveMethvin> final gzip size 33293
[12:55:25] <timmywil> sounds good to me, did we want to look at anything else before that?
[12:55:42] <DaveMethvin> i haven't seen anything come in that seemed hypercritical
[12:56:09] <DaveMethvin> i get the feeling that the bug reports won't arrive until we ship
[12:56:29] <DaveMethvin> i've been begging & pleading for ppl to test but it doesn't seem like they have been
[12:56:40] <DaveMethvin> either that or we write REALLY GOOD code
[12:57:04] <DaveMethvin> nah.
[12:57:10] <rpflo> I've been meanign to throw it at our app
[12:57:35] <DaveMethvin> rpflo: i think it would stick
[12:57:43] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: it's just really good
[12:57:52] <DaveMethvin> you just wait
[12:58:10] <DaveMethvin> actually i have a bug in the special events that i realized while i was working on docs
[12:58:12] <rpflo> there's some massive techincal debt at my new job, so we'll see
[12:58:23] <DaveMethvin> nothing critical so i'm gonna fix it in 1.7.1 and document that
[13:20:09] <DaveMethvin> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.js http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.min.js
[13:20:16] <DaveMethvin> everybody see those?
[13:20:49] <DaveMethvin> they look good to me
[13:21:50] <DaveMethvin> lol anyone using jquery-latest.js in production has just been UPGRADED!
[13:22:34] <ajpiano> so i can tweet EH?!
[13:22:48] <DaveMethvin> wait for it...

[13:35:14] <Rwhitbeck> jquery.com still says download 1.6.4 http://jquery.com/ :P
[13:43:52] <DaveMethvin> Rwhitbeck: yes, i still need to get down the checklist a bit more
[13:44:02] <Rwhitbeck> ;-)
[13:44:07] <DaveMethvin> do you have access to jquery.com? I've done the download links on dev
[13:44:20] <Rwhitbeck> no
[13:44:30] <DaveMethvin> i've never edited the home page
[13:44:56] <Rwhitbeck> I think Doug and/or danheberden do it each release?
[13:45:17] <danheberden> only if he takes me out to dinner first
[13:45:29] <DaveMethvin> oh YEAAAH
[13:45:34] <DaveMethvin> gettin sum tonite
[13:46:06] <danheberden> ... updating ..
[13:46:19] <danheberden> the branch wasn't updated?
[13:47:22] <danheberden> last commit was oct-11 DaveMethvin
[13:47:40] <danheberden> ooooh you weren't asking to update
[13:47:54] <DaveMethvin> did i actually edit that on oct 11?
[13:47:59] <DaveMethvin> i dont recall
[13:48:00] <danheberden> no, scott did something else
[13:48:08] <danheberden> i was thinking you already committed the change
[13:48:20] <DaveMethvin> not yet, i'm working on the other ones
[13:48:23] <danheberden> are the files up on the cdn?
[13:48:28] <DaveMethvin> yep
[13:48:33] <DaveMethvin> just need the links updated
[13:48:40] <DaveMethvin> i've got docs.jquery.com done
[13:48:46] <DaveMethvin> and emailing the other cdn guys now
[13:51:22] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I can email google
[13:51:37] <DaveMethvin> just did
[13:51:42] <DaveMethvin> now on to microsoft
[13:52:09] <danheberden> updated
[13:52:16] <danheberden> http://jquery.com/
[13:53:10] <necromancer> is there a reason why the syntax of $.each() has stayed the same?
[13:53:22] <danheberden> legacy code
[13:53:35] <timmywil> it's too big of a deal to change
[13:53:47] <danheberden> in a perfect world, it'd be nice.. but
[13:53:59] <danheberden> apprently i make the project imperfect
[13:54:00] <necromancer> understood
[13:54:16] <necromancer> but couldn't we do something like $.each(collection, function(single) { .. });?
[13:54:19] <DaveMethvin> danheberden: thanks! i owe you dinner now
[13:54:26] <danheberden> hell yes you do
[13:54:27] <necromancer> like if i don't specify a 2nd param
[13:54:47] <timmywil> necromancer: javascript doesn't really work that way
[13:54:56] <necromancer> uhh
[13:55:12] <necromancer> oh wait i guess not
[13:55:29] <necromancer> we need a $.forEach :)
[13:56:04] <ajpiano> we'll release that with the jquery-for-purists.js extensions
[13:56:26] <necromancer> hah
[13:56:39] <necromancer> jquery-for-devs-with-a-bug-up-their-ass-for-nice-looking-code.js
[13:57:18] <danheberden> jq-puritan.js - i like it
[13:57:58] <timmywil> I think it's time I admitted I need help with my docs additions
[13:58:17] <danheberden> no, the lolcat pics are good!
[13:58:49] <timmywil> they are minor, but to get them out quickly, maybe someone else could grab the note on .is(POS)
[13:59:44] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: i can do it tonight
[13:59:54] <DaveMethvin> since i was a co-conspirator
[14:00:01] <timmywil> thanks dave :)
[14:00:15] <DaveMethvin> actually i guess i was the instigator on that one
[14:00:23] <necromancer> ajpiano: could just bundle underscore with it ;)
[14:00:24] <timmywil> i guess you were
[14:00:39] <timmywil> i just fixed a sizzle bug in the process
[14:03:43] <timmywil> man already 1 on hacker news
[14:13:37] <ajpiano> and no snarky comments yet!
[14:19:27] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: you missed the comment on the blog from the guy who thinks .on() sucks
[14:21:27] <ajpiano> not sure why he has to know that it's being delegated
[14:26:35] <matjas> rwaldron: can we please get rid of jQuery#size as well?
[14:26:39] * matjas files a ticket
[14:27:53] <necromancer> so does this also fix that issue where animations were throttled when you tab away from a page on firefox?
[14:28:00] <necromancer> i heard that was a known issue that was gonna be fixed in the next release
[14:28:15] <timmywil> necromancer: that was fixed in 1.6.3
[14:28:19] <rwaldron> matjas probably too much extant code relying on that
[14:28:34] <necromancer> ah, thanks timmywil
[14:28:58] <matjas> rwaldron: but could it be considered for the next major version bump?
[14:29:09] <rwaldron> considered? sure
[14:29:45] <timmywil> danheberden: we should update the files sizes http://jquery.com/
[14:29:47] <matjas> http://jqbug.com/10657 \o/
[14:30:38] <timmywil> it can be considered, but I don't see that one getting removed
[14:35:23] <timmywil> gnarf, DaveMethvin: maybe there should be an example of a stop('queueName') on the stop docs
[14:40:15] <necromancer> look all i'm saying is we're at 1.7
[14:40:33] <necromancer> by 2.0, we have to like change everything
[14:40:37] <necromancer> because that's what people are gonna want
[14:40:49] <necromancer> people are going to want a massive code overhaul so they have to re-code their entire website
[14:41:02] <necromancer> then we can laugh at them
[16:00:43] <sneakyness> hey guys
[16:00:44] <sneakyness> I need some resources to teach a coworker about bad practices
[16:01:06] <sneakyness> he doesn't understand why adding and removing huge chunks of html via jaascript is a bad thing
[16:22:30] <aaronmcadam> sneakyness: I hear ya! come on #jquery tho
[16:23:05] <sneakyness> oh whoops I'm sorry, I thought I was
[16:23:06] <sneakyness> hahahah
[16:23:09] <aaronmcadam> :D
[17:05:47] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: good point about "in filters"
[17:07:51] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: didn't mean to nitpick. :)
[17:07:54] <timmywil> thanks for doing that.  I wasn't sure how to word it
[17:08:07] <DaveMethvin> not at all, definitely good to qualify
[17:13:49] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: i just noticed .removeAttr( list ) hasn't been documented yet
[17:14:20] <timmywil> also, perhaps we should publish callbacks in its current state
[17:14:35] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: yeah on .removeAttr that should be quick, i can do that
[17:14:58] <DaveMethvin> i saw a q about callbacks at hacker news, so  yeah asap would be good
[17:15:22] <DaveMethvin> i'll ping addy by email and see what he thinks, prolly best to let him pace that
[17:18:06] <timmywil> The code examples should probably adhere to the core style guidelines
[17:21:53] <timmywil> callbacks.fire() should elaborate on "list of arguments" and be clear it is not an array like trigger
[17:22:25] <timmywil> im just making notes here.  i might do some of this if addy wants
[17:23:40] <timmywil> i'd love to see a live example at least on the jQuery.Callbacks() page
[17:25:36] <timmywil> im he knows already, callbacks.fired needs a longdesc
[17:25:42] <timmywil> sure*
[17:26:59] <timmywil> ok, i'll compile this and email addy too and offer my help.
[20:03:51] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin "yeah it was fixed"
[20:03:52] <rwaldron> <3
[20:03:58] <rwaldron> did you see this earlier...
[20:04:02] <rwaldron> http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:array_extras
[20:04:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[20:04:47] <rwaldron> Oh, I thought you werent in the channel when I posted it here
[20:05:04] <rwaldron> I was too excited to contain myself
[20:17:49] <mikesherov> Hey guys... Thanks for the shout out in the blog post!
[20:18:54] <mikesherov> Glad I could play even a small role in developing this awesome project.
[20:21:05] <danzik17> congrats
[20:28:38] <DaveMethvin> thanks mikesherov
