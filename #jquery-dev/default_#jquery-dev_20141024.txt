[06:46:10] <jperrault> is there going to be a jquery ui 1.12.1 release this year?
[06:50:47] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: Well, we'll need to get to 1.12.0 first :-)
[06:51:02] <scott_gonzalez> But yes, hopefully that will ship this year.
[06:51:35] <jperrault> understood.  there are some a11y things that we are working on that won't make that, so I just wanted to get a feel for the timing on the next point release.
[06:52:14] <scott_gonzalez> .1's are usually within a month of .0's.
[06:55:03] <jperrault> thx
[07:08:03] <gnarf> fyi - we moved codeorigin last night - it's now on a new box - PM me if you think you might ever need to SSH in
