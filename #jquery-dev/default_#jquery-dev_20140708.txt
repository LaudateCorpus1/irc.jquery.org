[05:35:22] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez mikesherov DaveMethvin|away are we talking about a Promises/A+ shim or ES6 Promise shim? That
[05:35:27] <m_gol> * that's kinda different
[05:38:14] <scott_gonzalez> ES6. We only care about real standards.
[05:41:55] <m_gol> ah, I got fooled by the https://github.com/then/promise description
[05:42:09] <m_gol> README is fine but the description says only about Promises/A+
[06:04:35] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: Is there a list of differences somewhere?
[06:04:52] <scott_gonzalez> Or does Promises/A+ just deal with .then()?
[06:05:15] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: I haven't seen one but yes, Promises/A+ just deal with .then
[06:05:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, so we want something bigger, so that we have a defined API for generating the promises.
[07:28:40] <jperrault> Regarding http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9646, is this function being removed from ui.core entirely, in deference to jQuery's function?
