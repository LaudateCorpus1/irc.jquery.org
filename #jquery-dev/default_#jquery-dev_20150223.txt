[10:08:56] <m_gol> markelog__: funny, jQuery 2.1.1 is 4.5 KB smaller (gzipped) than 1.11.2
[10:09:07] <m_gol> now we only have 2.5 KB on master vs compat
[10:09:41] <m_gol> weird, I think once I counted it and dropping IE<9 saved ~13% but dropping just IE<8 around 3%
[10:09:47] <m_gol> something doesn't add up :-)
[10:11:55] <m_gol> my commit dropping older browsers saved ~1.2 KB; I can't find the other KB
[10:18:57] <markelog___> m_gol: case of losted KB )
[10:19:22] <m_gol> or rather "the other 800b" ;)
[10:19:50] <markelog___> m_gol: it does seem weird
[10:20:16] <markelog___> we need to invistigate!
[10:21:19] <markelog___> need a flashlight and magnifier
[10:21:30] <m_gol> :P
[10:21:38] <m_gol> I sense irony :P
[10:23:26] <markelog___> just some weary humor, will you check it out?
[10:37:58] <m_gol> markelog__: probably, but not today ;)
[10:43:58] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: What are your thoughts on having grunt-bowercopy warn if any specified file doesn't exist?
[10:45:20] <scott_gonzalez> I actually thought that was how it worked already, but I see that the warning is only if there were no files copied.
[10:46:18] <timmywil> hmm, can I see your config?
[10:46:41] <timmywil> It should already do that, but I have a theory
[10:47:17] <timmywil> hmm, actually my theory only applies to empty directories
[10:47:51] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: It's just https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L244-L245 over and over and over
[10:47:54] <scott_gonzalez> But it "fails" for 1.11.x
[10:49:00] <scott_gonzalez> Because the files were moved to the dist directory.
[10:50:20] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: Oh, actually, this is working.
[10:50:34] <timmywil> heh
[10:50:47] <timmywil> what was the problem?
[10:50:49] <scott_gonzalez> I had multiple terminal windows open in the same dir.
[10:51:05] <scott_gonzalez> And I had switched windows while the task was running.
[10:51:15] <scott_gonzalez> It did spit out some warnings.
[10:51:21] <timmywil> ah, cool
[10:51:49] <scott_gonzalez> That explains why I thought this was working before :-P
[10:51:59] <scott_gonzalez> Becuase it was!
[10:52:03] <timmywil> good!
