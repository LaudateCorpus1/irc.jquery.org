[05:05:31] <scott_gonzalez> someone familiar with events should look into http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7514
[05:05:51] <scott_gonzalez> specifically triggering resize on an element bubbles all the way to the window
[08:12:28] <gnarf> ajpiano: we doing a meeting for plugins today?
[08:13:11] <ajpiano> no that's thursday
[08:14:02] * gnarf shrugs
[08:14:06] <gnarf> days are so f'ed up
[08:14:14] <gnarf> i really should start putting this shit in a gcal or something
[09:50:54] <jqcommit> [jquery] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://bit.ly/jQERUx
[09:50:54] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Set timerId to true instead of a number so that intervals set to 1 are not accidentally cleared when stopped.  Fixes #9678. - timmywil
[11:26:46] <timmywil> JohnResig: I've done browser testing and we've got one error in the new Opera 11.5, but it only occurs on the full suite and not on ?filter=core
[11:27:20] <timmywil> confusing to me core: isXMLDoc - HTML
[11:27:50] <timmywil> iframe body element exception
[11:47:58] <timmywil> if anyone else wants to take a look, that'd be great.  What's retrieved from contents is an HTMLDocument with all undefined properties.  Probably something simple.
[11:58:17] <timmywil> ?tell JohnResig browser testing done except for one fail in Opera 11.5...only occurs on full suite: core: isXMLDoc - HTML iframe body element exception.  'body' at that point is an HTMLDocument as it should be, but all its properties are set to undefined, according to DragonFly
[11:58:18] <bot-t> timmywil, Okay.
[12:16:45] <phishbot> danheberden: hey dan.. i signed up for bug triage but haven't heard back. who should i talk to?
[12:18:52] <ajpiano> phishbot: bug triage is easiest
[12:18:55] <ajpiano> just... start doing it :)
[12:19:02] <phishbot> :D
[12:19:21] <ajpiano> i like getting the notification emails, but you can also use RSS or just check the recently updated tickets in trac
[12:19:28] <ajpiano> we need triageurs on both core and UI
[12:19:29] <phishbot> kk
[12:19:36] <ajpiano> so if you're feeling enterprising
[14:27:29] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez yt?
[14:27:58] <scott_gonzalez> I am
[14:28:02] <rwaldron> hey dude
[14:28:09] <scott_gonzalez> what's up?
[14:28:15] <rwaldron> jQuery UI uses the jQuery core style guide, correct?
[14:28:25] <rwaldron> I recall richard telling me this
[14:28:28] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[14:28:30] <rwaldron> great
[14:28:39] <rwaldron> are familiar with jQuery Mobile?
[14:28:39] <scott_gonzalez> there are still lots of files that don't conform yet
[14:28:51] <rwaldron> I'm sure, lot's of history
[14:28:59] <rwaldron> but you all are now
[14:29:02] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, we've been cleaning up
[14:29:11] <rwaldron> awesome
[14:29:16] <scott_gonzalez> and new code conforms, obviously
[14:29:20] <rwaldron> \of course
[14:29:26] <rwaldron> hm.
[14:29:41] <rwaldron> so, are familiar with jQuery Mobile? no?
[14:29:44] <rwaldron> you*
[14:29:54] <scott_gonzalez> not really
[14:30:01] <rwaldron> ok cool
[14:30:02] <scott_gonzalez> my guess is that it doesn't come close to confirming :-P
[14:30:07] <rwaldron> yeah...
[14:30:13] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, FG has their own style
[14:30:29] <rwaldron> if they do, i'd like to see what that is
[14:30:42] <rwaldron> my guess is it's "just be free form"
[14:30:44] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's whatever Scott Jehl feels like writing :-P
[14:31:03] <rwaldron> this isnt even linting or hinting because of space/tab mixing
[14:31:11] <scott_gonzalez> when Mobile first started and I was helping out a bit, I would go through and clean stuff up in the files I worked on
[14:31:18] <rwaldron> i'm trying to ramp up a new client project
[14:31:20] <scott_gonzalez> but the style was totally different
[14:31:34] <rwaldron> and i want _all_ of the source to be jshinted before it is compressed
[14:31:44] <rwaldron> but jquery mobile has rendered that impossible
[14:31:56] <scott_gonzalez> that's a shame
[14:32:00] <rwaldron> yeah
[14:32:04] <rwaldron> :(
[14:32:09] <scott_gonzalez> we should probably get it to conform before the 1.0 release
[14:32:19] <rwaldron> i totally agree
[14:32:28] <rwaldron> i would even volunteer to do it
[14:32:39] <rwaldron> do they have an irc channel?
[14:32:45] <rwaldron> i tried "jquery-mobile"
[14:32:47] <rwaldron> no dice
[14:32:52] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think they do
[14:33:09] <rwaldron> maybe i should just go to their offic
[14:33:14] <rwaldron> >:)
[14:35:35] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez i'm not sure where to begin
[14:35:49] <rwaldron> JohnResig are you around?
[14:47:57] <jzaefferer> rwaldron, scott_gonzalez, try #jquerymobile-dev
[14:48:05] <rwaldron> oh, thank you
[14:48:08] <rwaldron> :)
[15:05:27] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez great news
[15:05:43] <rwaldron> I just spoke to todd parker and he's going to let me do a full sweep
[15:05:45] <rwaldron> :D
