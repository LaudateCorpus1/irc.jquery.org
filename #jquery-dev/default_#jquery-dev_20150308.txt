[10:33:46] <sambuddhabasu1> hello everyone , I would like to participate for GSoC 2015 with QUnit project
[10:34:04] <arthurvr> Hey sambuddhabasu1!
[10:34:15] <sambuddhabasu1> arthurvr: I have followed the links you specified
[10:34:27] <sambuddhabasu1> arthurvr: but, I dont find the dist directory
[10:34:36] <sambuddhabasu1> I have already run the 'npm install' command
[10:36:35] <arthurvr> Of QUnit you mean?
[10:36:58] <arthurvr> You will need to `grunt build` if you want the dist directory.
[10:37:28] <sambuddhabasu1> yes of QUnit
[10:37:40] <arthurvr> Well, you will need to have grunt installed.
[10:37:48] <arthurvr> http://gruntjs.com/
[10:37:54] <arthurvr> thatâ€™s the task runner we use.
[10:38:04] <sambuddhabasu1> arthurvr: all right, the tests run now thanks
[10:38:11] <sambuddhabasu1> any beginner bugs for me to work on?
[10:39:39] <arthurvr> Honestly, I have no idea what tickets are open there. Iâ€™m following the project from a distance only. Iâ€™ll take a look.
[10:39:51] <sambuddhabasu1> thanks for the help :)
[10:43:49] <arthurvr> Think you will need to ask your mentor :))
[10:45:40] <arthurvr> jzaefferer: ^^
[10:49:20] <sambuddhabasu1> arthurvr: currently to get to know QUnit better, Im writing tests and checking what pops up when and how it works
[10:49:43] <arthurvr> Great!
[11:41:18] <ashg1910> arthurvr: What about channels other than jquery-dev?
[11:41:46] <arthurvr> ashg1910: This channel is meant for development, #jquery is meant for support questions.
[12:50:02] <tniessen> I'd like to participate in GSoC 2015 and would like to work on the testing infrastructure. How can I get in touch with the mentos (Oleg Gaidarenko, JÃ¶rn Zaefferer)?
[12:50:33] <arthurvr> cc jzaefferer markelog
[12:51:43] <tniessen> arthurvr: Thank you!
[12:52:04] <arthurvr> tniessen: Youâ€™re welcome!
[12:52:24] <arthurvr> tniessen: If you have any questions, feel free to ask tho. Other people might be able to answer.
[12:57:03] <tniessen> arthurvr: Okay, great! First question: The proposal suggests using browserstack (amongst other possibilities). I cannot think of a way to use browserstack (which is commercial and requires service authorization) for an open-source system, being available to everybody. We can neither grant everybody access to a single browserstack account nor can we expect developers to pay for an account. Is this consideration correct or did I mi

[14:25:55] <snover> tniessen: it is already in place and working for pep using intern 
[14:29:00] <tniessen> snover: Does that mean that the proposed idea is outdated? https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/GSoC-2015-Ideas-List#jquery-core---better-testing-infrastructure
[14:30:53] <snover> iâ€™d say so, but i donâ€™t think that jÃ¶rn and i are seeing eye to eye on some of this, and iâ€™m not involved in the jquery gsoc :)
[14:32:03] <snover> there is still some stuff there that would need to be done
[14:32:31] <snover> adapting whatever php tests exist to a node.js service, though there is prior art that can be copied and adapted there too so it wouldnâ€™t need to be done from scratch
[14:36:48] <tniessen> snover: Okay, thanks, I will try to get in touch with one of the mentors.
