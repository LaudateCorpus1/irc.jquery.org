[06:41:39] <DaveMethvin> yo yo
[06:41:39] <b-ot> DaveMethvin, you have one new message, say ‚Äúread‚Äù to me when you wish to read it.
[06:41:45] <DaveMethvin> b-ot:read
[06:41:45] <b-ot> DaveMethvin, from snover, 1d 8h ago: that thing I just said about needing to have a chat when he gets back for me love ok?
[06:42:17] <DaveMethvin> hmm, never saw that in the scrollyback
[08:30:59] <jaubourg> hi there
[08:32:07] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: you around? (and hi btw)
[08:34:46] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin; anyway, curious regarding the status of #10467 and #12044... ping me when you're around ;)
[09:17:58] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: um, plop!
[09:18:08] <jaubourg> hey
[09:18:14] <jaubourg> won't have much time sadly :/
[09:18:17] <DaveMethvin> sorry, was dog walking
[09:18:21] <DaveMethvin> no problemo
[09:18:21] <jaubourg> np
[09:18:27] <jaubourg> will have to in a moment too ;)
[09:18:46] <jaubourg> soooo... what's the status on these ones?
[09:18:58] <DaveMethvin> docs#10467
[09:19:01] <bot-t> [#10467] Deferreds should always resolve asynchronously (open feature) - http://jqbug.com/10467
[09:19:48] <DaveMethvin> docs#12044
[09:19:49] <bot-t> [#12044] ready callback should always be called asynchronously (open feature) - http://jqbug.com/12044
[09:20:01] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah that's the one i was thinking it was related to
[09:20:03] <jaubourg> of course, discussion occured out of the ticket in the mail thread
[09:20:09] <jaubourg> :/
[09:20:36] <DaveMethvin> well i think one of the things on the mail thread was that gnarf said there were places in animations where it needs sync?
[09:20:56] <jaubourg> and we'd need to do acrobatics in ajax too
[09:21:12] <DaveMethvin> i'm not sure we can change this now, although i would still like to, b/c there are so many places where we expect sync
[09:22:09] <DaveMethvin> looking at the mail thread now
[09:22:59] <jaubourg> my only issue is that you cannot un-async code. That and the fact pro-async arguments are more often than not very weak.
[09:23:25] <DaveMethvin> that is a good point, it's possible to go the other direction
[09:23:27] <jaubourg> I could see the interest of resolving async yet call callbacks in the same event loop
[09:23:54] <jaubourg> but it doesn't solve the "cannot un-async" issue
[09:24:41] <DaveMethvin> breaking a lot of code (including code we don't know about) is a big issue here for me
[09:25:09] <jaubourg> I hear you
[09:25:19] <DaveMethvin> so I'm inclined to close these wontfix, and actually #12044 is working as documented as far as the docs go isn't it?
[09:25:49] <DaveMethvin> i think we ran into a situation with IE9/10 where if it was async it would have worked
[09:26:01] <DaveMethvin> but we could have fixed that with setTimeout
[09:26:10] <jaubourg> afaik but people are often surprised that the order the callbacks are added is respected (ready stuff)
[09:26:18] <jaubourg> and yes, when needed, just use setTimeout
[09:26:24] <jaubourg> sync to async is easy enough
[09:27:13] <DaveMethvin> let me close those wontfix just to get a resolution and see if anyone comes up with a reason why not to do that
[09:27:35] <jaubourg> so regarding the order the callbacks are added the following code: $(function() { alert(1); $(function() { alert(2); }); alert(3); }) will alert 1 3 and then 2 because the second callback is added after the first and thus is called after
[09:27:42] <jaubourg> which is a property of the deferred imp
[09:28:47] <jaubourg> I know the ordering is used in animations but I'm not sure it shouldn't be laxed
[09:29:47] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: yes, let's see if this is still a hot topic for people... maybe we can unblock the ready ticket since we can setTimeout if needed and the topic can be looked at separately
[09:29:58] <jaubourg> ?
[09:30:26] <DaveMethvin> yeah we could just setTimeout that
[09:31:45] <DaveMethvin> btw jaubourg https://gist.github.com/3889970#gistcomment-607827
[09:32:00] <DaveMethvin> i think domenic's tests are missing error handling cases perhaps?
[09:33:54] <jaubourg> Seems I'll really have to write this article
[09:35:41] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: opinion on docs#13011?
[09:35:42] <bot-t> jaubourg, Timeline ñ jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - http://bugs.jquery.com/timeline
[09:35:54] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13011
[09:36:57] <jaubourg> I think we should only throw exceptions in oldIE... doesn't make sense to gimp all other browsers, especially with 2.x on the horizon
[09:37:29] <DaveMethvin> well, ie takes care of throwing its exception so if we pull out our artificial one we're set
[09:37:39] <DaveMethvin> i really think it should go
[09:37:59] <jaubourg> ok, really gotta fly right now
[09:38:04] <jaubourg> and I agree with you
[09:38:25] <DaveMethvin> ok hope your french chef thing goes well!
[09:46:40] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: what'd I miss?
[09:46:52] <DaveMethvin> oh not much yet gibson042
[09:46:59] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg stopped by but had to go
[09:47:06] <DaveMethvin> we talked about the deferred tix
[09:47:22] <DaveMethvin> i decided to to close the one wontfix b/c it seems like it will break too much
[09:47:40] <DaveMethvin> was just looking at the open tix
[09:54:46] <gibson042> +1 on removing isDisconnected
[09:55:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'll do that in a separate pull ... i was trying to figure out whether there would be any impacts
[09:55:41] <DaveMethvin> it *seems* like it might let us accept fragments in more places so users could pass them in
[09:55:54] <DaveMethvin> or at least it seems like a prerequisite to doing that
[09:56:02] <gibson042> yeah
[09:56:38] <gibson042> given what we're already doing with .before and .after, it seems like the perfect time
[09:56:51] <gibson042> as long as it's prominent in the upgrade guide
[09:57:05] <DaveMethvin> to finish your sentence  "the perfect time ... to screw EVERYTHING up."
[09:57:12] <DaveMethvin> yeah 
[09:57:30] <gibson042> EVERYTHING? this stuff was full of bugs anyway :P
[09:57:39] <DaveMethvin> certainly it wasn't consistent
[09:57:47] <DaveMethvin> and broken differently from version to version
[10:00:29] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: your pull for #12600 looks good
[10:00:47] <gibson042> speaking of big changes...
[10:01:09] <gibson042> attr/prop crossover *is* already deprecated, right?
[10:01:16] <DaveMethvin> yes
[10:01:26] <gibson042> the followup to that one is boolHook
[10:01:27] <DaveMethvin> but it also needs prominent mention in the guide
[10:01:50] <DaveMethvin> and those hooks need to be moved to the compat plugin
[10:01:58] <gibson042> yep
[10:52:20] <DaveMethvin> damn, there's more writing than coding here

[16:35:12] <mikesherov> Krinkle|detached: sorry about jumping the gun today about the mergeatron stuff. I skimmed the comment you wrote and was taken aback about the wording of "either mergeatron gets it or we can't use it", and jumped to conclusions
[16:35:28] <mikesherov> it won't happen again. And thanks for contributing insightful comments
[17:27:35] <DaveMethvin> finally back here
[17:27:57] <paul_irish> \o/
[17:28:19] <DaveMethvin> hey paul_irish what was up with that "bullshit" thing?
[17:28:32] <DaveMethvin> i got a laugh out of it
[17:29:11] <paul_irish> oh hah
[17:29:17] <paul_irish> hansellman messages us
[17:29:31] <paul_irish> msft runs a "bad word" search on all software it ships
[17:29:38] <paul_irish> and since modernizr is bundled with VS2012
[17:29:48] <paul_irish> the "bullshit" in a JS comment came up
[17:30:07] <DaveMethvin> so Modernizr failed the "bullshit detector" :P
[17:30:11] <paul_irish> and they needed to remove it
[17:30:11] <paul_irish> haha
[17:30:14] <paul_irish> exactly
[17:33:15] <snover> oh, you remind me, i need to talk to someone at msft about what looks like a bug in ie10‚Äôs engine that is impacting some of our code

[18:04:33] <snover> DaveMethvin: SO LOOKING FORWARD TO NEW MASTER
[18:05:15] <DaveMethvin> me too ... deeleeet all the oldie things
[18:15:29] <snover> DaveMethvin: i want to start importing modules~
[18:16:43] <DaveMethvin> We have a two-key import process:   Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V ... imported.
[18:17:16] <snover> bawful
[18:26:55] <mikesherov> :-)
[18:27:22] <mikesherov> what started with css array support is spiraling into a set of perf enhancements for css
[18:27:30] <mikesherov> gibson042: yt?
[18:27:37] <gibson042> yo
[18:27:43] <mikesherov> there he is
[18:27:53] <mikesherov> can you look at a draft real quick?
[18:28:12] <gibson042> sure
[18:29:08] <mikesherov> ok, let me push my branch up
[18:29:42] <mikesherov> https://github.com/mikesherov/jquery/pull/new/jquery:master...mikesherov:t11938
[18:29:48] <mikesherov> can you see that, gibson042 ?
[18:30:16] <mikesherov> essentially, I'm going to abstract out gCS so it can be passed to jQuery.css as a parameter to avoid multiple lookups
[18:31:02] <mikesherov> but first, I want to remove the "numeric" param of jQuery.css so I'm not making another 5 param signature
[18:33:02] <gibson042> I can't see that... is https://github.com/mikesherov/jquery/compare/2eda329...t11938 right? (2 commits)
[18:33:20] <mikesherov> yup
[18:47:49] <mikesherov> gibson042: any thoughts?
[18:48:03] <gibson042> looking at it now
[18:48:26] <gibson042> I like collapsing the numeric handling together
[18:50:38] <gibson042> what's behind all the `curCSS` ‚Üí `jQuery.css`?
[18:50:54] <mikesherov> just to get the signature simplicity
[18:51:18] <mikesherov> I only want curCSS when it's necessary.
[18:51:25] <mikesherov> I dunno, it saved some bytes too :-)
[18:53:23] <mikesherov> gibson042: added 2 more commits: https://github.com/mikesherov/jquery/commit/175404b26ded91e5fe5dc48db6051d68df4564d4
[18:53:24] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Commit on jquery by Mike Sherov (3m, 55s ago): add ability to curCSS to retrieve styles from a passed in CSSStyleDeclaration
[18:53:33] <mikesherov> https://github.com/mikesherov/jquery/commit/b8ea95dd58bcb3de2a4ecb081d44e2edb5ab8655
[18:53:34] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Commit on jquery by Mike Sherov ( ago): speed up dimensions and width getters by using a passed around style declaration
[18:53:38] <gibson042> I don't mind; I figured the animations would be plenty fast anyway
[18:54:53] <mikesherov> well, the last 2 commits will speed them up nicely
[18:55:04] <gibson042> :)
[18:55:10] <mikesherov> https://github.com/mikesherov/jquery/commit/b8ea95dd58bcb3de2a4ecb081d44e2edb5ab8655 will hopefully do wonders
[18:55:11] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Commit on jquery by Mike Sherov (1m, 34s ago): speed up dimensions and width getters by using a passed around style declaration
[18:55:52] <mikesherov> perfing it now, but should be as awesome as this: http://jsperf.com/getcomputedstyle-perf
[18:57:18] <gibson042> the curCSS functions would probably compress better if you assigned to a new variable like `computed = computedArgument || getStyles( elem )` rather than try to reuse the argument
[18:59:10] <mikesherov> think so?
[18:59:22] <mikesherov> I'll check that at the end
[18:59:28] <mikesherov> thanks for the heads up
[18:59:43] <mikesherov> any other thoughts on the approach
[19:00:17] <mikesherov> it's +38 right now‚Ä¶ but then I'm also going to reuse this for the css array
[19:03:35] <gibson042> I really like it
[19:05:34] <gibson042> I'm a big fan of this change
[19:06:48] <mikesherov> cool
[19:06:55] <mikesherov> perf results coming up
[19:07:15] <mikesherov> http://jsperf.com/passing-styles
[19:07:20] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: yt?
[19:07:31] <DaveMethvin> yep mikesherov
[19:07:44] <mikesherov> I have a +39 change that does this: http://jsperf.com/passing-styles
[19:07:49] <mikesherov> thoughts?
[19:08:54] <DaveMethvin> well i like that it's faster ... where's the code?
[19:09:26] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/mikesherov/jquery/compare/2eda329...t11938
[19:09:54] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: it's basically passing around the result of a getComputedStyle call
[19:10:08] <DaveMethvin> right, which you'll want to do to get multiples
[19:11:15] <mikesherov> right, this is before that
[19:11:26] <mikesherov> I'm using it right now in places where I already have to get multiples
[19:11:55] <DaveMethvin> ok, now i'm looking for what happened to numeric
[19:12:35] <mikesherov> so, before numeric was a separate boolean
[19:12:47] <mikesherov> I basically made numeric and extra smash together
[19:13:33] <mikesherov> oh, actually, I made one mistake
[19:17:00] <mikesherov> https://github.com/mikesherov/jquery/commit/b406431c03fb5dfc711ac80343b6a1692043f2f6
[19:17:01] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Commit on jquery by Mike Sherov ( ago): fixing regression
[19:17:14] <mikesherov> so the speed up is mainly in Chrome and Firefox
[19:18:13] <DaveMethvin> well it will be a lot faster than not carrying around the gCS when you get to the array
[19:19:15] <mikesherov> right
[19:20:03] <mikesherov> The remaining work is actually pretty trivial, but what do you think? Worth the extra complexity and size?
[19:20:07] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: ?
[19:20:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[19:20:16] <DaveMethvin> i think it's worth it
[19:20:27] <DaveMethvin> if someone needed 4 properties it saves a lot of time, right?
[19:20:53] <mikesherov> so, the proof is in the pudding for the width / height
[19:21:32] <mikesherov> there are several places where UI can use it
[19:21:53] <DaveMethvin> yeah, something like getting all the border properties
[19:22:08] <mikesherov> and I like new.css(old.css(['width', 'height', 'boxSizing']));
[19:22:08] <DaveMethvin> so i think it has both convenience and perf upsides
[19:22:31] <mikesherov> ok, cool. I'll finish this off then
[19:22:37] <DaveMethvin> sounds good!
[19:22:42] <mikesherov> thanks
[19:22:50] <mikesherov> thanks gibson042 for looking it over
[19:23:50] <gibson042> I'm glad to
[19:36:37] <gibson042> mikesherov is mergeatron working right now?
[19:36:46] <mikesherov> gibson042: it might be down
[19:37:02] <mikesherov> I just need to sit down with gnarf and get it supervisor backed
[19:37:11] <mikesherov> found 2 more bugs it needs to deal with
[19:37:33] <mikesherov> 1 is occasionally github fails, and mergeatron doesn't retry responding
[19:37:49] <mikesherov> mergeatron only tries once to post the status
[19:38:01] <mikesherov> the other is that it gets fooled when a job is aborted early
[19:38:02] <gibson042> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1063#issuecomment-11164669 failed to kickoff a job
[19:38:02] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Pull request on jquery by gibson042 (1d, 6h ago): Fix #12600: don't use value property in place of value attribute
[19:38:11] <mikesherov> it might not be running right now
[19:38:15] <mikesherov> let me check
[19:38:16] <gibson042> if I'm reading http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquery correctly
[19:41:07] <mikesherov> I just started it back up
[19:41:36] <gibson042> thanks
[19:41:40] <gibson042> should I repost that comment, or will it pick it up from before?
[19:44:42] <mikesherov> you don't need to repost
[19:44:55] <mikesherov> mergeatron tests on pull request open
[19:45:04] <mikesherov> and then again when new commits get pushed up
[19:45:21] <mikesherov> if it hasn't tested yet, it'll retest
[19:45:40] <mikesherov> if the comment was after the last test time, it should retry
[19:45:42] <gibson042> cool
[19:45:45] <mikesherov> hopefully
[19:45:48] <mikesherov> ;-)
