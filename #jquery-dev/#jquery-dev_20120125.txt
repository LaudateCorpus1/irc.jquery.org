[08:39:45] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone from infrastructure around?
[11:58:08] <timmywil> .
[19:58:37] <mikesherov> .
[19:59:17] <mikesherov> Why oh why can't JSHint lint html files that contain javascript?
[20:09:06] <gf3> WHY DO HTML FILES CONTAIN JAVASCRIPT!?
[20:11:46] <mikesherov> gf3, why wouldn't they?
[20:12:30] <mikesherov> at least a call to a bootstrapper?
[20:12:44] <gf3> because of like rules and like best practices and stuff
[20:13:39] <mikesherov> um
[20:13:45] <mikesherov> ok
[20:14:04] <mikesherov> are you saying that there should literally just be a script tag and that's it
[20:14:13] <mikesherov> no call to a bootstrapper at least?
[20:14:52] <gf3> dude, I'm just busting your balls
[20:15:04] <gf3> you should ping anton
[20:15:14] <mikesherov> oh
[20:15:15] <mikesherov> duh
[20:15:22] <mikesherov> it's too late at night for me
[20:15:41] <mikesherov> anton removed HTML file support consciously from JSHint
[20:15:44] <mikesherov> oh well
[20:15:50] <mikesherov> I'll figure it out tomorrow
[20:16:15] <mikesherov> I'll write a dirty dom parser that just extracts the inline JS and jshints just that
[20:16:21] <mikesherov> g'night
[20:16:53] <gf3> 'night
