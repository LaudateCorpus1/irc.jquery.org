[06:32:33] <jaubourg> hi there
[06:35:58] <realz> ahoy ppl
[06:36:16] <realz> https://github.com/realazthat/v8.rocket << working on this :D
[06:36:29] <realz> and I am trying to get jquery to work in it ... eventually
[06:36:50] <realz> I got some of it working so far
[06:37:20] <realz> I am up to getting Sizzle to work properly
[06:37:55] <realz> I am able to select elements by id and by tag
[06:38:07] <realz> but anything more complex fails
[06:38:29] <realz> so what do you guys think of the project
[07:22:45] <louisremi> Hi there
[07:24:07] <jaubourg> hey louisremi
[07:24:16] <louisremi> Hey Jaubourg
[07:25:00] <louisremi> jaubourg: I have to take a look at your CSS Animations based effects.js
[07:25:30] <louisremi> jaubourg: what are the rationals behind it?
[07:33:06] <louisremi> or am I mistaking? I thought you had a branch with CSS3 Animations...
[07:33:30] <jaubourg> no branch, I'm toying around locally
[07:33:37] <jaubourg> going back and forth between idea
[07:33:38] <jaubourg> s
[07:48:00] <louisremi> jaubourg: ok
[07:50:58] <rwaldron> wycats yt?
[07:55:07] <JohnResig> Hey everyone!
[07:55:23] <rwaldron> morning JohnResig :)
[07:55:32] <JohnResig> almost 1.7 meeting time!
[07:56:00] <rwaldron> I just pinged wycats
[07:56:07] <rwaldron> I dont think he's voted on anything
[07:56:15] <JohnResig> yeah :-/
[07:56:16] <rwaldron> nor has jorn
[07:56:21] <rwaldron> jzaefferer yt?
[07:56:28] <JohnResig> well, did joern vote in the spreadsheet?
[07:56:39] * rwaldron looking
[07:56:41] <jzaefferer> hey, I'm here
[07:56:46] <rwaldron> hay!
[07:56:50] <jzaefferer> didn't get around to do any voting
[07:56:55] <rwaldron> jzaefferer can you?
[07:57:02] <rwaldron> meetng is at 12 EST
[07:57:11] <JohnResig> (so in 1 hour)
[07:57:20] <rwaldron> and your opinion is important
[07:57:48] <JohnResig> http://bugs.jquery.com/report/501
[07:58:07] <jzaefferer> 45 seconds per ticket, sure :p
[07:58:09] <rwaldron> jzaefferer at that link about ^^
[07:58:16] <rwaldron> you can just click the title
[07:58:27] <rwaldron> and it will open the description and voting tool in page
[07:58:37] <jzaefferer> will take a look, as that other meeting now isn't happening anyway
[07:58:50] <JohnResig> make sure you're logged in first
[07:58:50] <jzaefferer> did you see what I added about Closure Compiler to the agenda?
[07:59:13] <JohnResig> jzaefferer: oh... hmm
[07:59:24] <JohnResig> may be kind of hard to discuss that in addition to 1.7
[07:59:56] <JohnResig> but yeah, if they want to provide better support, I think we're game
[08:00:07] <jzaefferer> that's why I put it up front, just take a few minutes to tell them that, if Closure Compiler would support jQuery in advanced mode, you would make use of that
[08:00:24] <JohnResig> sure
[08:01:08] <jzaefferer> afaik there are a few features missing for advanced mode to work and be useful with jQuery, but so far that hasn't been a priority for their team
[08:01:29] <jzaefferer> if they know we are interested in that, the priorities could change
[08:01:33] <JohnResig> ah, gotchya
[08:03:17] <jzaefferer> ah, docs meeting is actually happening, so have even less time to vote...
[08:03:28] <JohnResig> ok
[08:05:26] <jaubourg> John: will you put proposals in categories like for 1.6? (A, B and C)?
[08:05:42] <jaubourg> and hi
[08:06:11] <jaubourg> I'll really have to go right at the end of the meeting though, just so you all know ;)
[08:06:42] <DaveMethvin> hi guys ...
[08:07:22] <DaveMethvin> i'm on a flight but i think i should be able to be around 12-1pm for the meeting
[08:07:36] <DaveMethvin> as long as the wifi and my battery hold out
[08:07:54] <jaubourg> fingers crossed
[08:25:11] <scott_gonzalez> is there a way to see 1.7 tickets that I haven't voted on yet?
[08:27:41] <JohnResig> jaubourg: I'm going to sort them and we'll figure out the categories from there
[08:27:45] <JohnResig> scott_gonzalez: unfortunately no
[08:27:49] <JohnResig> DaveMethvin: cool!
[08:28:00] <ben_alman_> oh shit i forgot to vote
[08:28:01] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[08:28:04] <ben_alman_> where did the time go
[08:35:55] <jaubourg> ben: IN UR PANTZ
[08:39:23] <ben_alman_> I found a way to put docs#4596 and docs#4446 together into one thing $(this).find(selector).andSelf(selector); would work for both
[08:39:43] <ben_alman_> brb
[08:41:14] <ben_alman_> test
[08:42:25] <jaubourg> hey ben
[08:42:28] <jaubourg> bye ben
[08:42:33] <ben_alman> wat
[08:42:34] <jaubourg> re ben
[08:42:42] <ben_alman> :P
[08:43:08] <ben_alman> wtf
[08:43:58] <ben_alman> oh wait, that might be my znc
[08:44:04] <ben_alman> and i'm not logged into it... hrmph
[08:44:50] <ben_alman_> test
[08:44:58] <ben_alman> that was annoying
[08:47:30] <ben_alman> lol this +1/-1/0 thing must be confusing for bug submitters
[08:47:38] <ben_alman> they think they're supposed to join in
[08:47:50] <ben_alman> wish we had a better way of showing these in trac
[08:48:49] <ajpiano> i'm fine with if a random person throws a +1/-1 on a ticket
[08:48:57] <jaubourg> still beats the spreadshit imo
[08:49:06] <jaubourg> thanks for this John, really
[08:49:45] <ben_alman> yeah the spreadsheet was utter fail
[08:49:53] <ben_alman> +1 this
[08:51:05] <ajpiano> the only minor complaint i'd have about this is that it updates the ticket description on every vote
[08:52:38] <ben_alman> the only minor complain i have about you is that you left my desk a total mess
[08:52:50] <ben_alman> food, silverware, papers
[08:52:53] <ben_alman> gross
[08:54:57] <ajpiano> i kind of ran out in a rush, meant to apologise for that
[08:55:04] <ajpiano> but i don't recall any papers... wat is papers
[08:56:05] <ben_alman> food wrappers
[08:56:33] <ajpiano> :(
[08:56:34] <ajpiano> sorry
[08:59:30] <jaubourg> meeeeeting time damn near
[09:00:29] <JohnResig> running vote tally right now
[09:07:45] <ben_alman> damn i was still voting
[09:07:46] <ben_alman> oh well
[09:08:07] <ben_alman> i'm trying to figure out if docs#6386 is even a real bug
[09:12:54] <ben_alman> shit i forgot to join the channel
[09:34:28] <timmywil> oh jaubourg: here's an idea for that try finally thing http://grab.by/ahXn
[10:50:20] <louisremi> What about the feature requests in the original spreadsheet that didn't have any #bug attached?
[10:50:30] <JohnResig> louisremi: I ported all of them over
[10:50:40] <JohnResig> louisremi: I filed bugs for them
[10:51:39] <louisremi> JohnResig: I remember seeing requests for supporting CSS3 transitions in compatible browsers. Did the bug only receive negative votes?
[10:51:51] <JohnResig> louisremi: seems like it, yeah
[10:52:02] <louisremi> JohnResig: alright
[10:54:42] <rwaldron> JohnResig for items we flat out kicked, mark as "wontfix"?
[10:54:44] <cmcnulty> I was late to the meeting.  Anyone know result of #6782 discussion?
[10:54:53] <JohnResig> rwaldron: yeah
[10:55:08] <JohnResig> cmcnulty: it's in
[10:55:22] <rwaldron> cool
[10:55:22] <cmcnulty> thx
[10:55:59] <rwaldron> JohnResig one more thing... so we dont waste time dup'ing work, lets mark the updated numbers in the spreadsheet
[10:56:10] <rwaldron> i'm thinking... gray bg on the ticket number col?
[10:56:15] <gnarf> JohnResig: am I supposed to be able to se the voting box btw?
[10:56:17] <JohnResig> rwaldron: k
[10:56:22] <JohnResig> gnarf: dunno
[10:56:30] <rwaldron> JohnResig eg http://gyazo.com/48df12d5faec72f0d8fce95d8075a7f8.png
[10:56:31] <rwaldron> cool
[10:56:45] <gnarf> cuz I can now...wasn't able to before
[10:56:58] <JohnResig> rwaldron: meaning that you've already closed it or whatever?
[10:57:06] <rwaldron> yes
[10:57:52] <JohnResig> cool, go ahead
[10:57:57] <rwaldron> JohnResig sorry, one last thing, which milestone are we setting them to?

[11:00:48] <JohnResig> rwaldron: 1.7
[11:00:54] <rwaldron> great

[11:05:48] <gnarf> the &copy; in the footer on trac still says 2010
[11:06:29] <ben_alman> maybe its true
[11:08:11] <gnarf> maybe

[21:50:57] <timmywil> danheberden: yt?
[21:51:09] <danheberden> aye
[21:51:13] <danheberden> timmywil ^
[21:51:44] <timmywil> oh nvm
[21:52:03] <timmywil> danheberden: sry, thought half of prop's docs were deleted by accident
[21:52:10] <danheberden> heh
[21:52:15] <danheberden> that'd make me shit my pants
[21:52:16] <timmywil> totally confused myself docs#9520
[21:52:28] <timmywil> ugh bot
[21:54:07] <ryanneufeld> bot-t keeps dying
[21:54:16] <ryanneufeld> how does one bring it back?
[22:00:30] <danheberden> bribe temp01 with copious amounts of money
[23:19:36] <addyosmani> opinion: where we're mentioning a term that users may not be aware of in the docs and there's accompanying information about that term in the MDC, does it make sense to link out, or should we just leave it up to users to do the research themselves?
[23:20:47] <addyosmani> I'm asking as some here have expressed a dislike of us linking out to any third party sites.
