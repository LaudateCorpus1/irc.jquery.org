[06:12:51] <AzaToth> JohnResig: arth thou around?
[06:14:45] <AzaToth> anyone über-intelligent around?
[06:18:25] <erichynds> looks like just a bunch of stupid idiots
[06:19:01] <AzaToth> heh
[06:34:23] <Krinkle> AzaToth: What're you up to ?
[06:38:53] <AzaToth> Krinkle: generally I wonder if it's more efficient to transmit an binary file containing an sorted hashmap than resorting to json
[06:39:05] <AzaToth> this is in trelation to gettext and mo-files
[06:39:09] <AzaToth> relation*
[06:39:40] <AzaToth> som e people here might be intelligent enough to have a good answer ツ
[06:39:53] <Krinkle> Perhaps consider #wikimedia-dev / #mediawiki as well :)
[06:40:10] <AzaToth> heh
[07:12:23] <timmywil> intelligent? hahahahahaha…oh.
[07:17:52] <timmywil> Hmm. I do not claim intelligence (and I'm not familiar with mo-files), but it seems like the efficiency is only a factor at the end points.  The transmission is, as you say, in binary so it doesn't care.  I'd just say use whichever is more convenient and takes less code to parse.  JSON is popular for it's easy-of-use, but it's certainly not always the best option or easy to use.  That's the best I got: "depends". hehe
[07:20:21] <AzaToth> timmywil: the issue here is that while mo files are standardized and internally constructed to allow binary search, json seems to be optimized in most clients that creating an mo parser in js might nnot give any added experience
[07:20:34] <AzaToth> ±spelling
[07:20:56] <AzaToth> that's why I asked JohnResig as he is the dude here
[07:25:28] <Krinkle> AzaToth: JSON, for the sake of our grandchildren
[09:57:34] <timmywil> ahhhhh
[09:58:09] <timmywil> Textual is currently using 87.37 MB of memory in 64-bit mode.
[09:58:31] <jaubourg> omg why is it in 64-bit mode?
[09:58:33] * jaubourg hides
[09:58:35] <jaubourg> hi timmy
[09:59:12] <timmywil> i just tab-completed /me and was curious
[09:59:18] <timmywil> heh
[11:50:37] <mbutubuntu> hello folks, I've a question for you... why in the .animate() function there are many for (p in prop) ?
[11:51:20] <mbutubuntu> this simple block causes problems when anyone extend the Object.prototype class
[11:51:35] <mbutubuntu> I can reproduce it
[11:52:11] <mbutubuntu> it could be a BUG...!?
[11:55:25] <dabear> mbutubuntu: you shouldn't extend object.prototype
[11:55:30] <dabear> not a bug
[11:55:58] <mbutubuntu> dabear, why don't ?
[11:56:11] <dabear> ?
[11:56:41] <mbutubuntu> sorry ... why it's better to not extend Objects?
[11:57:11] <dabear> extending Object.prototype means you cause incompatabilities like this
[11:57:15] <dabear> so don't do it
[11:57:33] <mbutubuntu> so it could be useful when using not-third-part libs?
[11:58:23] <danheberden> could be, but you could achieve the same functionality by NOT extending the prototype
[11:58:50] <mbutubuntu> ok, so a function is better than a method? :-P
[12:00:27] <danheberden> e.g. $.trim vs String.prototype.trim
[12:00:49] <danheberden> the jquery one doesn't have to worry about getting effed with, or effing with someother implementation or future browser addition or whatevs
[12:00:57] <dabear> nobody said that, only you shouldn't extend globals unless you know the consequences
[12:01:17] <mbutubuntu> ok, so you suggest to write a jquery plugin?
[12:01:30] <mbutubuntu> maybe it's better...
[12:01:31] <dabear> depends on the situation?
[12:17:01] <mbutubuntu> dabear, danheberden thank you... your suggestions were very useful
[12:41:00] <Krinkle> mbutubunto: Fwiw, JavaScript doesn't have classes nor methods. It has constructor functions with prototype functions.
[12:41:26] <Krinkle> $.trim actually uses String.prototype.trim when available afaik :P
[12:41:30] <Krinkle> (or should)
[12:53:52] <timmywil> With obverse structure (prototype), I think method is still accurate, normally defining collections of behaviors for instances.
[12:54:03] <timmywil> with the*
[13:01:51] <gnarf> a method is simply a function called in an object context i believe
[13:02:14] <gnarf> at least i still use the word "method" to describe say the .html method on a jQuery instance
[13:02:26] <gnarf> would I be wrong?
[13:03:28] <ajpiano> i think most people would agree that object does not have Classes but it definitely does have methods...
[13:03:48] <timmywil> ^^
[13:04:38] <ajpiano> s/object/JavaScript
[13:04:52] <timmywil> figured
[13:05:17] <tbranyen> gnarf: yeah on an instance, which is effectively an object
[13:05:22] <ajpiano> <--- the P that EBKAC
[13:06:07] <gnarf> cool, so when I'm talking about animate someone won't tell me that they aren't methods? :)
[13:07:11] <timmywil> gnarf: you should be fine :)
[13:13:34] <AzaToth> are there any "official" jQuery string format/template/sprintf constructs?
[16:54:38] <Krinkle> ajpiano: I guess the reason passing "foo()" to a function still gets into peoples mind is due to setTimeout that does an eval on the string
[16:54:50] <Krinkle> I see it in many examples setTimeout( "foo()" ,1000 ) :(
[16:55:16] <Krinkle> that or generally not knowing about "passing by reference"
[16:55:19] <ajpiano> that, and the very concept of referencing a function is itself  foreign to them
[16:55:22] <ajpiano> heh "_
[16:55:23] <ajpiano> :)
[17:00:45] <dabear> ajpiano: what's a function?
[17:00:59] <dabear> is it something you do in real life?
[17:01:37] <ajpiano> it's a ction that is really enjoyable
[17:01:51] <dabear> oh, so it's like sex?
[17:01:55] <dabear> and jquery has it?
[17:02:48] <dabear> so while i browse my news papers online, jquery is behind the scenes having sex?
[17:03:13] <ajpiano> pretty much
