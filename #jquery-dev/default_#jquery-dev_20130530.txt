[08:57:21] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Interestingly, we never use .unwrap() in UI.
[08:57:47] <scott_gonzalez> We must do unwrapping manually.
[08:58:14] <DaveMethvin> Usually it's a line or two of code to do it yourself
[08:58:30] <DaveMethvin> but of course the methods have to handle every bizarre case
[08:58:34] <DaveMethvin> which makes them sooooo big
[08:58:55] <DaveMethvin> "I want to unwrap an element under the body!"
[09:00:10] <scott_gonzalez> $.error( "You didn't want to do that" ) :-)

[11:37:56] <DaveMethvin> github are you flaking out today?
[11:38:18] <scott_gonzalez> GitHub says "Yes, I'm fucked"
[11:38:37] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Are you aware of status.github.com?
[11:39:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah but i have a reliable way to tell if it's unreliable :D
[11:40:38] <DaveMethvin> plus i'm using git protocol, they say that's operating normally but it's not
[11:41:46] <DaveMethvin> i was just about to push out the releases but don't want to have them hang up on something stupid and then spend two hours cleaning up the mess
[11:42:31] <DaveMethvin> my build scripts are like bottle rockets, one does not simply stop in the middle of htem
