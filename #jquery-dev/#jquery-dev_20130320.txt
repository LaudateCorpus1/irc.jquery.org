[01:55:13] <rworth> JamesMGreene all the ones that seem relevant to your question, yes. Others are on http://jquery.org/sponsors/
[01:56:16] <rworth> the relationship seems to have existed for as long as jeresig had a jQuery website. For all I know he used Media Temple personally and started using them for jQuery, or asked them to donate or they offered to donate
[01:56:40] <rworth> but the beautiful thing is (mt) has covered every server and bandwidth resource for jQuery since day 1
[01:57:23] <rworth> and still do; which is why they're recognized as a Founding Member
[04:05:11] <JamesMGreene> Thanks for the info, rworth (and at 4am, wow, bonus points!) =)
[04:05:31] <rworth> np
[06:52:15] <dd5_> hi experts :)
[06:52:35] <dd5_> i know this is a dev channel, but anyways, can i ask for help?
[06:55:58] <scott_gonzalez> dd5_: If we provide support for you, then everyone will start coming here, and this channel will be flooded with non-dev discussion.
[06:56:56] <dd5_> @scott_gonzales yes, you're right - didn't think of that, sorry.

[07:57:30] <scott_gonzalez> Always visible, full text is link.
[07:57:41] <DaveMethvin> me likey scott_gonzalez
[07:58:48] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: nice
[08:00:12] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Good? You said you wanted it to have less contract than the text, but I think this is fine.
[08:00:23] <jzaefferer> yeah, looks good
[08:00:43] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[08:00:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'll land that, do the 50th grunt-jquery-content release for today, then deploy the API sites.
[08:01:40] <DaveMethvin> we need a streaming protocol for including grunt-jquery-content to stay up to date
[08:02:27] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[08:09:58] <jzaefferer> kswedberg: ping on https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/pull/26
[08:09:59] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Pull request #26 by jzaefferer (4mon 1w ago): Generated customFields for added and deprecated attributes.
[08:10:09] <jzaefferer> I wonder if that can be killed
[08:10:18] <jzaefferer> maybe DaveMethvin knows something about it? ^
[08:10:57] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: we have no plans for updating grunt-jquery-content to grunt 0.4, right?
[08:11:56] <kswedberg> jzaefferer: wow. my memory must have been erased. I don't recall this at all. Looking...
[08:12:33] <jzaefferer> MIB?
[08:13:04] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yeah, I kinda want to wait till 0.5 to do any updates for sites.
[08:13:12] <jzaefferer> okay
[08:13:13] <scott_gonzalez> I don't really care how far out that is.
[08:13:30] <scott_gonzalez> We have no issues with 0.3.x and upgrading some of our projects will be a huge pain.
[08:13:48] <scott_gonzalez> And 0.5 is going to change the world again.
[08:14:03] <kswedberg> jzaefferer: yeah, probably, heh.
[08:14:57] <DaveMethvin> so i take it that semantic versioning can be totally ignored until reaching 1.0, which is why so many projects aren't at 1.0 yet?
[08:15:36] <kswedberg> oh yeah! ok, I think if we want to style things based on deprecated/removed status, we can do that with the categories now. so, yeah, we can probably kill that pull request.
[08:15:51] <kswedberg> jzaefferer ‚Üë
[08:16:05] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg btw i'm not done with the issues for api.jquery.com, i have more damage to do
[08:16:18] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: awesome!
[08:16:25] <DaveMethvin> unfortunately i still don't have a local setup so i am just pushing to stage
[08:16:29] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: btw, question: is $.error() deprecated? Or just .error()?
[08:16:36] <kswedberg> bummer
[08:16:51] <DaveMethvin> .error() only
[08:17:02] <DaveMethvin> oh and that wasn't marked was it?
[08:17:20] <jzaefferer> kswedberg: okay, then I'll close both my PR and the underlying ticket
[08:17:50] <kswedberg> .error() didn't have the category, but it did have the deprecated attribute. $.error() has the category but not the attr. Imma gonna remove that category from $.error()
[08:18:00] <kswedberg> jzaefferer: sounds good!
[08:18:02] <scott_gonzalez> Down to 1 issue!
[08:18:42] <DaveMethvin> we started with an even 100 issues in api.jquery.com, down to 77 right now
[08:19:05] <DaveMethvin> i'm about 70% done with the kitchen-sink ticket for 1.9 stuff
[08:23:08] <kswedberg> awesome, scott_gonzalez and DaveMethvin!
[08:24:09] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: are you looking at the events doc ticket? 
[08:24:47] <jzaefferer> It seems like someone from mobile should've complained by now if they'd actually need that
[08:25:33] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom complains to me about once a month :-P
[08:36:18] <jzaefferer> That sounds like good motivation to work on that ticket
[08:41:48] <scott_gonzalez> api.jquery.com takes FOREVER to deploy
[08:43:09] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: It's live: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:01:17] <ryanneufeld> hey DaveMethvin http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/interview-with-dave-methvin/
[10:01:19] <ryanneufeld> nice
[10:07:53] <shoky> +1
[10:14:40] <snover> why are the pull quotes in that article not actually pull quotes
[10:15:10] <DaveMethvin> i noticed that too, i've never seen that style
[10:15:29] <DaveMethvin> the full-width pull quotes are actually inline
[10:16:52] <snover> i don‚Äôt know that it is a style so much as it is someone not understanding what pull quotes are for :)
[11:22:50] <Ancient> Is there a QUnit test suite consisting of all the raw bugs that currently have workarounds in the core codebase?
[12:06:55] <bjohn465> I'm trying to run grunt on a branch of 1.9-stable code, and I keep getting the following warning on the compare_size task: "Warning: Object #<Object> has no method 'expandFiles'"
[12:07:16] <bjohn465> I'm running node v0.8.17.
[12:08:27] <bjohn465> Do you think it's my version of node? Has anyone else seen this warning?
[12:08:45] <gibson042> bjohn465: what version of grunt are you using?
[12:09:30] <bjohn465> grunt-cli v0.1.6 and grunt v0.4.0rc5
[12:10:02] <gibson042> update to grunt 0.4.0 or higher and try again
[12:10:05] <gibson042> npm install
[12:11:10] <bjohn465> Thanks. I just noticed that package.json was updated when I pulled the latest 1.9-stable code.
[13:01:14] <gnarf> nice DaveMethvin -  ‚ÄúCore ain‚Äôt done until UI won‚Äôt run,‚Äù made it into the article ;)
[13:16:43] <JamesMGreene> Anyone know of any services that host Windows, Linux, and Mac servers/VMs?
[13:16:49] <JamesMGreene> Only one I've found so far is Joyent
[13:17:00] <JamesMGreene> but their OSS deal isn't going to cut it for PhantomJS builds
[13:17:17] <JamesMGreene> I've got to run... but if you have recommendation, tell the bot for me
[13:17:26] <JamesMGreene> (or email me)

[16:41:57] <nschonni> jzaefferer: ping
[17:47:14] <gnarf> so hey
[17:47:29] <gnarf> do we have an official sane "column count" to break lines at?
[17:48:27] <gnarf> i usually use 75 as a "warning" and 90 as a "why the hell haven't you broken this line yet
[17:48:32] <gnarf> but
[17:48:38] <gnarf> it might be nice to kinda standardize that
[17:49:16] <gnarf> cc DaveMethvin|away rwaldron scott_gonzalez
[17:54:41] <nschonni> JSHint has the "maxlen" option to enforce this
[17:54:52] <snover> 120!
[17:58:28] <gnarf> snover i think 120 is too much for code you might throw up on a projector :)
[17:59:30] <snover> oh, so we‚Äôre talking about fake code?
[20:15:22] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I don't think we do, I have rulers at 72, 80, 100 in Sublime.
[20:15:57] <scott_gonzalez> I try to keep my code under 80, but I let some lines go past if it's easier to read than splitting.
[20:25:13] <nschonni> 29 lines beyond 90 chars, 6 go beyond 100
[20:29:48] <nschonni> nevermind those are just the long lines in the Gruntfile, missed the separate .jshintrc files
[22:23:03] <JamesMGreene> yo
[22:24:26] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer Krinkle: Can one of you guys make the bare repos for the rest of the QUnit plugins and give me push perms?
[22:25:53] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer Krinkle: So: qunit-assert-canvas, qunit-assert-closeEnough/qunit-assert-close), qunit-assert-step, qunit-runner-phantomjs/qunit-driver-phantomjs/???
[22:26:07] <JamesMGreene> And then I think we were going to break up the themes each into a separate repo...?
[22:27:25] <JamesMGreene> Well, I have no plans to touch the themes for now
[22:27:43] <JamesMGreene> but the rest I'd be happy to split out when I have short periods of free time here and there
[22:58:52] <gnarf> JamesMGreene: is this part of a larger plan somewhere?
[22:59:15] <JamesMGreene> gnarf Yeah
[22:59:35] <gnarf> issue link?
[23:00:00] <gnarf> i can make those repos for ya, just wanna see whats going on there
[23:00:38] <gnarf> also, kinda makes me wonder if we shouldn't just host those in personals for now
[23:01:11] <gnarf> cc scott_gonzalez jzaefferer
[23:07:35] <JamesMGreene> No issue that directly states we are moving all of the plugins but it's in the meeting notes
[23:07:38] <JamesMGreene> http://bit.ly/qunitci¬†
[23:07:40] <JamesMGreene> See Feb 28th
[23:08:00] <JamesMGreene> Various issues have notes about moving a given plugin or another but not all of them
[23:20:17] <gnarf> just wondering who's owning em 
[23:20:29] <gnarf> they your projects or jquery projects yeah?
[23:21:49] <gnarf> also, re: mergeatron, i really want to see if we can integrate it with open stack
