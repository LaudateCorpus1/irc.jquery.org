[15:08:08] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Regarding https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/217#issuecomment-45760663
[15:08:52] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Now that we know what the scope of the issue is and what needs to be done, I see that it's not as trivial as we thought. Maybe someone else could give it a shot given the details I've provided?
[15:17:56] <jzaefferer> Considering that we're the only two "around" that ever worked on TestSwarm, I guess that burden falls back to me. My biggest problem is the lack of local testing. I don't know how to test testswarm-browserstack with a local TestSwarm install (or at all, I've never worked on that module)
[15:18:54] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: Given the above, maybe you can help a bit more in creating a local setup that is enough for the issue at hand?
