[06:25:05] <DaveMethvin> yay jzaefferer!
[06:25:05] <bot-t> (5 hours 45 mins ago) <jzaefferer> tell DaveMethvin any idea what these guys are talking about? https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/issues/490#issuecomment-8147808
[06:25:22] <DaveMethvin> looking now
[06:25:52] <DaveMethvin> um jzaefferer did they have a test case?
[06:27:40] <jzaefferer> course not!
[06:28:20] <DaveMethvin> haha
[06:28:20] <jzaefferer> meh, sorry for wasting your time
[06:28:27] <DaveMethvin> well it might be a problem
[06:28:30] <DaveMethvin> but it's hard to tell

[06:32:14] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: Is there a way to force Chrome to update?

[06:41:41] <LordThumper> hi
[06:42:20] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: LordThumper ^^ has expressed a level of interest in perhaps building a  builder for jquery core modules
[06:42:22] <LordThumper> I might build a prototype frontend for the jQuery module selector this weekend
[06:42:26] <LordThumper> ^
[06:42:35] <ajpiano> is this something we are interested in
[06:42:49] <DaveMethvin> sure!
[06:42:57] <LordThumper> :)
[06:43:00] <DaveMethvin> LordThumper: the dependency issues are what make this hard
[06:43:10] <DaveMethvin> think about how a user will know what modules they nee
[06:43:11] <DaveMethvin> d
[06:43:33] <DaveMethvin> the grunt.js file has a dependency tree already
[06:43:36] <LordThumper> Well this will be a prototype at first
[06:43:37] <DaveMethvin> but it's pretty lumpy
[06:43:45] <LordThumper> I will figure it out as I go
[06:43:57] <LordThumper> What technology do the servers run out?
[06:44:06] <DaveMethvin> ngnix servers
[06:44:07] <LordThumper> I mean should I develop in Asp.net/php/node?
[06:44:19] <DaveMethvin> php
[06:44:24] <DaveMethvin> or node
[06:44:31] <DaveMethvin> i can't remember what is installed already on the boxes
[06:44:34] <DaveMethvin> gnarf would know
[06:45:07] <LordThumper> Well I'll try to create the UI first anyways
[06:45:32] <LordThumper> Ok then, i'll post here when I have something working
[06:45:33] <LordThumper> Thanks
[06:45:37] <ajpiano> LordThumper: think bare-bones in terms of styling
[06:46:00] <LordThumper> Ok will do
[06:46:02] <ajpiano> cause we obviously have a lot of style/branding etc that we would want to apply to keep it in keeping with the rest of the site
[06:46:08] <ajpiano> so don't want you spinning your wheels on that :)
[06:46:18] <LordThumper> I will try to use the jQueryUI module selector structure
[06:46:34] <LordThumper> If that is OK?
[06:46:46] <ajpiano> ok - but bear in mind there is a new jquery ui download builder in the works as well :p
[06:46:56] <LordThumper> hehe
[06:47:16] <ajpiano> LordThumper: truth be told, i don't think the complexity really lies in the <form> side of things
[06:47:21] <ajpiano> but rather in the backend, as DaveMethvin alluded to
[06:47:28] <LordThumper> Yes I understand that
[06:47:40] <ajpiano> but i guess you need some way to <form> your ideas :)
[06:48:04] <LordThumper> Ok then, I'll try to fiddle abit with the command-line app.
[06:48:08] <ajpiano> let us know what you come up with and we can go from there :)
[06:48:17] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'd just get a skeletal html page going, then work on the mechanicals
[06:48:19] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
[06:48:19] <ajpiano> thanks for the enthusiasm though!
[06:48:24] <LordThumper> Will do. Speak again this weekend then :)
[06:48:36] <ajpiano> :)
[06:48:43] <LordThumper> I love jQuery, would be awesome if I can give something small back
[06:49:23] <ajpiano> we would welcome it !
[06:49:31] <LordThumper> :)
[07:32:05] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: is there something we can do about the bug tracker? it's been acting up a lot lately. even a simple reboot if that helps
[07:35:48] <jzaefferer> cc ryanneufeld ^^^
[07:36:23] <ryanneufeld> jzaefferer: that'll be gnarf

[07:48:24] <DaveMethvin> i think that is the final commit for 1.8.1, all tix closed ... let' wait for the test results

[08:18:38] <doesallmagic> dave.methvin: Fix #12370. Explicitly coerce bool/undef to integer.
[08:25:32] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: seems tickets don't autoclose unless the commit message ends with Fixes #____
[08:27:56] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: i use "fix #xxxx" all the time, it is probably b/c the tracker it throwing sql stacks today
[08:28:21] <timmywil> then boo tracker
[08:28:33] <ryanneufeld> Phat stacks?
[08:30:02] <ajpiano> fixes, resolves, and closes work automatically
[08:34:15] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: Now why might this happen? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12429  SHEESH!
[08:35:48] <scott_gonzalez> HAHAHA, size!
[08:35:52] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[08:36:29] <scott_gonzalez> Just reply saying "use CSS"
[08:39:25] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: heh, it's calling the size method isn't it
[08:39:31] <DaveMethvin> yep
[08:39:38] <DaveMethvin> i'm putting together a long answer
[08:39:44] <DaveMethvin> i don't think we want to fix this
[08:39:51] <DaveMethvin> I HATE THAT SIGNATURE
[08:42:00] <timmywil> yea, no thanks. I'd just suggest using attr after creation, or even { attr: {} }
[08:43:12] <timmywil> lol comment 1
[08:46:52] <scott_gonzalez> Haha, who replied?
[08:47:23] <jzaefferer> took me just three times through the recaptcha carousel
[08:48:10] <scott_gonzalez> :-/ We should just drop CAPTCHA, it's horrible.
[08:55:41] <snover> it stops bots but not the cheaply paid east european spammers
[09:15:55] <DaveMethvin> if those east europeans work so cheaply we should pay them to keep trac free of spam
[09:16:15] <snover> DaveMethvin: good idea
[09:21:58] <ryanneufeld> isn't that like paying protection money to the mafia though?
[09:22:13] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: IF IT WORKS WHO CARES?
[09:22:18] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[09:22:39] <scott_gonzalez> I guess the analogy would be that if we decide to stop paying them they'd spam us like crazy :-)
[09:23:57] <ryanneufeld> we already have that...
[09:24:03] <ryanneufeld> oh wait... I get it !

[11:21:39] <Krinkle> http://bugs.jquery.com/

[11:22:59] <ryanneufeld> you load the page, it fails
[11:23:01] <ryanneufeld> you reload and it's there
[11:23:05] <ryanneufeld> just happened to me now
[11:23:31] <ryanneufeld> mysql errors are terse and vague
[11:23:48] <ryanneufeld> are persistent connections in use?
[11:23:57] <ryanneufeld> I know with php that can cause all kinds of issues
[11:25:56] <Krinkle> yeah
[11:36:37] <ryanneufeld> every time I listen to the Tron Legacy soundtrack I want to watch the movie agian
[11:49:18] <ryanneufeld> I'm a die hard chrome guy, but the new FF features in 16 are gonna be awesome http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JfXcXcEHL0&feature=player_embedded
[11:55:48] <snover> but will it have hidpi support? https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=674373 nope!

[13:30:10] <DaveMethvin> i still like you snover
[13:31:06] <snover> DaveMethvin: WHATEVER DUDE LIKING PEOPLE IS SO DUMB WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU
[13:32:34] <DaveMethvin> see, THAT is why i like you
[13:34:43] <snover> licking people, on the other hand
[13:34:45] <snover> is like a sport
[13:36:38] <ryanneufeld> fun and games till someone loses an eye?
[13:37:00] <DaveMethvin> if either of you are responsible for chrome 21 not liking gmail on my system, you are in big trouble
[13:37:09] <ryanneufeld> I am not, poke paul_irish
[13:37:13] <DaveMethvin> honestly, i am refreshing 20 times a way
[13:37:16] <ryanneufeld> he's got their ear
[13:37:25] <DaveMethvin> he needs to grab lower
[13:37:33] <ryanneufeld> they might want it back, he could ransom it for a fix
[13:37:35] <DaveMethvin> that'll get their attention
[13:38:16] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: yt?
[13:59:36] <DaveMethvin> timmywil mikesherov rwaldron gibson042 jaubourg gnarf and all others: Last call for 1.8.1!  Last call for 1.8.1!
[13:59:53] <timmywil> BUT EVERYTHING IS BROKEN
[14:00:28] <timmywil> i mean, ok
[14:00:31] <DaveMethvin> lol
[14:00:44] <DaveMethvin> that's quite a mood swing :D
[14:00:54] <snover> that is how i feel every time i make a new dojo release
[14:01:06] <timmywil> happens all the time
[14:01:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's like, "here come all the people who never tested before"
[14:01:31] <DaveMethvin> oh i never test a .0 it has too many bugs so i wait for the .1 to use it
[14:01:48] <DaveMethvin> OMG the thickbox plugin broke!
[14:01:57] <timmywil> heh
[14:02:09] <timmywil> I should fork thickbox just for the fun of it
[14:02:17] <snover> making thickbox continue to work is kind of like…
[14:02:23] <snover> the ultimate litmus test of backwards compatibility
[14:03:45] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, my changelog has a sql dump in it
[14:04:40] <DaveMethvin> that's better
[14:08:05] <ryanneufeld> we always wait for .1 in production but test on 1.newest in dev
[14:18:46] <ajpiano> +1 to ryanneufeld's ping of gnarf from 30 minutes ago :p
[14:21:06] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: Is it possible to downgrade Chrome and keep all of your history/profile settings/etc.?
[14:28:47] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 3 new commits to master: http://git.io/7Ag2LA
[14:28:47] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Update release script and notes builder. - Dave Methvin

[14:28:47] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Updating the source version to 1.8.2pre - Dave Methvin
[14:28:53] <DaveMethvin> AND STAY OUT!
[14:33:14] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: Nevermind, it seems to at least be using the same history.
[14:33:21] <scott_gonzalez> That should be good enough.
[14:33:24] <paul_irish> kk
[14:33:46] <paul_irish> chrome can downgrade but it'll bitch about profile being not compatible
[14:33:49] <paul_irish> but its mostly compatible
[14:33:51] <paul_irish> i think
[14:34:25] <Krinkle> $('<div>').data('mw', { foo: 1 }).data('mw.foo.bar')
[14:34:29] <Krinkle> $('<div>').data('mw', { foo: 1 }).data('mw.foo')
[14:34:32] <Krinkle> both returns mw
[14:34:38] <Krinkle> are both a bug ?
[14:37:33] <FJ1> @dave 1.8.1 looks good for me. where can i find all changes?
[14:39:42] <DaveMethvin> FJ1: wait for the blog post, pls
[14:39:53] <DaveMethvin> gnarf ryanneufeld either of you around?
[14:40:03] <ryanneufeld> aye
[14:40:04] <DaveMethvin> need some help with the cdn
[14:40:13] <FJ1> okeydokey
[14:40:21] <DaveMethvin> it doesn't seem to be showing 1.8.1
[14:40:31] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: not sure I can help you with that one...
[14:40:35] <DaveMethvin> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.1.js
[14:40:48] <DaveMethvin> scp seems to have copied it
[14:41:01] <snover> DaveMethvin: something is broken
[14:41:09] <DaveMethvin> lol  yeah
[14:41:10] <snover> this isn’t working on my netscape
[14:41:19] <snover> i’ma submit a ticket kk
[14:41:28] <DaveMethvin> ok NOW you're starting to bother me lol
[14:41:34] <snover> i need this for my ui so i am going to put it in the ui tracker
[14:41:38] <snover> because it’s ui
[14:41:55] <DaveMethvin> while i'm waiting i'll notify the cdns at least
[14:42:01] <scott_gonzalez> snover: Don't forget to link to your intranet where you see the bug.
[14:42:14] <snover> scott_gonzalez: i can’t just paste it in the ticket?
[14:42:53] <scott_gonzalez> snover: Only if it's over 100 LOC.
[14:43:03] <scott_gonzalez> And using quirksmode.
[14:43:45] <snover> http://pastebin.com/JnVCnr2a
[14:44:42] <snover> I would apologise for ruining your brains but I HAVE NO REMORSE
[14:45:44] <scott_gonzalez> o_O var myJSONObject = "{\"PubGUIButtons\":{\"PubGUIButton\":[";
[14:46:06] <scott_gonzalez> haha: varResourceURI = responseJSON.ResourceResponse.Resources.Resource.resourceURI;
[14:46:43] <scott_gonzalez> I like how variables start with var.
[14:47:05] <snover> enterprisey man
[14:47:49] <scott_gonzalez> Wait, this code uses dojo...I thought only jQuery users were supposed to not know how to write JS :-P
[14:49:03] <snover> well if you notice it actually uses dojo *and* prototype
[14:49:06] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Can you do me a favor and upload something to dropbox?
[14:49:22] <DaveMethvin> wat
[14:49:22] <b-ot> how can i do this codes work only in a specific div tags
[14:49:29] <scott_gonzalez> I guess they need all the help they can get...
[14:49:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'll email it to you.
[14:49:43] <scott_gonzalez> It's a new mockup for the API sites.
[14:49:49] <snover> when you farm out all your programming to infosys it really doesn’t matter what library you’re using :)
[14:50:14] <scott_gonzalez> sent
[14:51:23] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: where do you want it?
[14:51:33] <scott_gonzalez> foundation/redesigns/api
[14:52:04] <DaveMethvin> see if it made it scott_gonzalez
[14:52:13] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!

[14:52:16] <doesallmagic> * dave.methvin: Updating the source version to 1.8.2pre
[14:52:24] <scott_gonzalez> yup, thanks
[14:52:44] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Great, now I need to go update jQuery UI.
[15:04:29] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: how do I update the jquery.com home page today? :)
[15:05:04] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/blob/legacy/page/index.html
[15:05:09] <scott_gonzalez> Notice that it's the legacy branch.
[15:05:22] <scott_gonzalez> Whenever gnarf is around, we'll be moving to master.
[15:05:27] <scott_gonzalez> So you might want to make the change in both.
[15:17:52] <mikesherov> hi?
[15:18:16] <mikesherov> so, did I miss last call for 1.8.1?
[15:18:19] <mikesherov> It's cool
[15:18:23] <mikesherov> 1.8.1 is cool
[15:19:15] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: DaveMethvin yelled from the rooftops an hour ago, but you weren't around.
[15:19:21] <mikesherov> yeah
[15:19:30] <mikesherov> That's what I'm referring to
[15:19:35] <mikesherov> my IRC client was buzzing
[15:19:44] <DaveMethvin> ding fries are done
[15:19:47] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #357: FAILURE in 27 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/357/
[15:19:48] <mikesherov> and I noticed: DaveMethvin: timmywil mikesherov rwaldron gibson042 jaubourg gnarf and all others: Last call for 1.8.1!  Last call for 1.8.1!
[15:19:58] <mikesherov> LOL
[15:20:12] <mikesherov> ding fries are done: Project jQuery Core build #357: FAILURE in 27 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/357/
[15:20:17] <mikesherov> right on cue
[15:20:18] <DaveMethvin> swarmy you are both too late and a liar!
[15:21:02] <DaveMethvin> i dunno if it's chrome or gmail, but one of them really screwed up lately
[15:21:13] <DaveMethvin> i have to refresh the gmail window every 10 minutes
[15:21:16] <DaveMethvin> or it's hosed
[15:21:28] <DaveMethvin> at least THEY can't blame it on jquery
[15:22:39] <scott_gonzalez> Gmail is working fine for me.
[15:22:49] <scott_gonzalez> I just downgraded Chrome to stable because dev was hosed for me.
[15:43:47] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: go for it
[15:44:13] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I'm not sure what needs to change. I assume it's something in puppet?
[15:44:22] <gnarf> nah, just a checkout :)
[15:44:24] <scott_gonzalez> Or do I just log into the server and change which branch it's on?
[15:44:26] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[15:44:29] <scott_gonzalez> jq01?
[15:44:31] <gnarf> yup
[15:44:39] <gnarf> be ready with a deploy too
[15:45:06] <scott_gonzalez> What do we need to get it to deploy?
[15:45:08] <scott_gonzalez> tag jqueryui.com?
[15:45:14] <scott_gonzalez> err...jquery.com
[15:45:14] <gnarf> for now, do it by hand
[15:45:28] <gnarf> i don't have the auto scripts on the live servers yet
[15:45:47] <scott_gonzalez> oh, you just mean run `grunt deploy` after switching branches.
[15:46:05] <gnarf> yup
[15:46:47] <scott_gonzalez> Same credentials as stage?
[15:50:39] <gnarf> yup
[15:50:51] <gnarf> some day soon we should change that
[15:51:43] <scott_gonzalez> done
[15:52:44] <gnarf> no more legacy? :)
[15:52:58] * gnarf cheers for scott_gonzalez
[15:53:43] <scott_gonzalez> And qunitjs.com doesn't look broken!
[15:53:47] <scott_gonzalez> So that's good :-P
[16:00:27] <scott_gonzalez> Just deployed the updated api.qunitjs.com :-)
[16:00:29] <scott_gonzalez> http://api.qunitjs.com/asyncTest/
[16:00:31] <scott_gonzalez> sexy
[16:03:42] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: yt?
[16:04:35] <gnarf> ajpiano: how about you?
[16:05:08] <ajpiano> i am here for a few, was just about to space
[16:05:20] <gnarf> ajpiano: you want the default / to goto the new event right?
[16:05:28] <gnarf> thats what your text meant about flipping switches?
[16:05:35] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I'll leave the legacy branches around for a few days and if everything seems fine, I'll delete them.
[16:05:41] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: sounds fair
[16:05:54] <ajpiano> gnarf: yes, re: flipping switches but now i'm almost inclined to say like
[16:06:03] <ajpiano> do the switch at midnight, and we'll announce the thing tomorrow morning
[16:06:06] <gnarf> early tomorrow morn?
[16:06:09] <gnarf> sounds good
[16:06:10] <ajpiano> 7 o clock on a thurs is silly
[16:06:18] <gnarf> I'll flip it over early tomorrow
[16:06:18] <ajpiano> can you just like, flip it at midnight or whatever
[16:06:31] <ajpiano> or before you go to sleep
[16:07:11] * gnarf nods
[16:07:22] <gnarf> sorry, i've been third shift lately
[16:07:30] <gnarf> can't seem to get away from it
[16:08:38] <ajpiano> it's ok, we'll play with the hand we're dealt i suppose
[16:08:44] <ajpiano> and do it better next time around
[16:09:08] <ajpiano> whether it's this past tuesday, or tomorrow, or tuesday of next week morning, it's prob a touch too late
[16:09:12] <ajpiano> in general
[16:09:14] <ajpiano> so we know
[16:09:22] <ajpiano> i'm gonna go eat dinner, had an interesting day here
[16:09:36] <ajpiano> i'll catch up w you tonight tho
[16:10:35] <gnarf> k
[16:36:27] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/pull/59
[16:37:16] <Krinkle> OMG AWESUM! The "Public" label on github repo pages actually animates 90 degrees in resizing the window
[16:37:19] <Krinkle> most important thing ever
[16:38:06] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[16:38:19] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: seems reasonable.
[16:38:37] <scott_gonzalez> Let me just compare a few sites.
[16:39:13] <Krinkle> margin collapsing takes care around at the headings
[16:42:45] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: btw, do we have a copy of code.origin.jquery.com on jq03? it isn't a git repo
[16:42:46] <Krinkle> somewhere in puppet maybe?
[16:42:50] <scott_gonzalez> merged
[16:42:58] <Krinkle> how is that thing managed. seems a lot of content we wouldn't want to have to regenerate or scrap off the internet
[16:42:59] <scott_gonzalez> It's not a git repo.
[16:43:07] <Krinkle> I know it isn't.
[16:43:27] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I transposed those words when I read what you wrote.
[16:43:36] <scott_gonzalez> I read "isn't it a git repo" as if it was a question.
[16:43:40] <Krinkle> aha
[16:43:57] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ^
[16:45:57] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: I always get nervous updating the CDN because I type out the scp commands.
[16:46:10] <gnarf> Krinkle: code.origin.jquery.com is what it is
[16:46:12] <scott_gonzalez> I also SSH in and edit the index file directly on the server.
[16:46:47] <gnarf> a giant file bucket
[16:47:05] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Are there any plans to make it a repo?
[16:47:13] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: that repo would be huge
[16:48:13] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/3225e241f935f082177b
[16:48:39] <gnarf> 15 gig?
[16:48:50] <scott_gonzalez> holy crap
[16:48:51] <gnarf> johnbender: ^^^^
[16:48:55] <Krinkle> last week I tried making it a local git repo, and succeeded
[16:48:57] <Krinkle> took about 2 hours
[16:49:15] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? mobile nightlies?
[16:49:17] <scott_gonzalez> seriously?
[16:49:34] <Krinkle> But then I saw today that jquery-git.js, mobile/latest and qunitjs was modified again (no problem), but thought I'd just rm -rf .git again
[16:49:38] <scott_gonzalez> That's 94% of it
[16:50:09] <Krinkle> even if I  just version index.html, git status takes minutes to run because of untracked files
[16:50:52] <Krinkle> maybe put it in the infrastructure repo (puppet files:// ?), or a separate repo maybe
[16:51:43] <Krinkle> prolly best separate so we can take pulls for index.html
[16:52:03] <Krinkle> so how does it get updated now?
[16:52:06] <gnarf> by hand
[16:52:09] <Krinkle> (e.g. the jquery-git.js file)
[16:52:12] <gnarf> scp
[16:52:15] <gnarf> via jenkins
[16:52:17] <Krinkle> that's a cron I suppose from jenkins
[16:52:20] <gnarf> after build
[16:52:47] <Krinkle> right
[16:52:47] <Krinkle> which runs on the same server
[16:52:55] <Krinkle> ideally we'd have a git account that has push access to that github repo
[16:53:00] <Krinkle> so jenkins can auto-push it
[16:53:23] <gnarf> we could do that, but i feel like that would just grow crazy big
[16:53:34] <gnarf> every commit of every lib creating a new commit in code.origin
[16:53:45] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that'd be a bit crazy
[16:53:51] <gnarf> seems bad
[16:53:58] <scott_gonzalez> But couldn't we just not put the git builds in the repo?
[16:53:58] <gnarf> perhaps .gitignore the .git versions
[16:54:04] <Krinkle> it wouldn't be much bigger than the raw files, since files are never modified (except for -git)
[16:54:12] <Krinkle> yeah
[16:54:17] <Krinkle> gitignore for latest and -git
[16:54:35] <gnarf> and mobile/nightlies until we can attack the mobile team
[16:54:36] <gnarf> :)
[16:54:39] <Krinkle> and the stable ones can go in the repo, those don't change, so it shouldn't be that much bigger than the raw files
[16:54:56] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: We'll just create a cronjob that deletes /mobile/nightlies :-P
[16:55:21] <Krinkle> and we should be able to commit from jq03 to github when the person doing it uses ssh -A to allow key challenges to resolve locally
[16:55:32] <Krinkle> so no need to download locally to push
[16:55:43] <gnarf> Krinkle: I'm gonna make an infrastructure issue about this to spread the idea around
[16:55:52] <Krinkle> ok
[16:56:11] <Krinkle> if anything I'd like to version index.html so it won't be destroyed if someone screws up an edit
[16:56:26] <scott_gonzalez> heh, what were they doing back then? http://cl.ly/image/0o3q2G2G1k2f
[16:56:42] <gnarf> Krinkle: or we can just make the "jqadmin" have a key to the repo
[16:56:54] <Krinkle> we don't use jqadmin anymore
[16:57:01] <gnarf> for that use case we do
[16:57:07] <gnarf> there are too many people who need access to that folder
[16:57:07] <Krinkle> and would be nice to have the commit assigned to the right person
[16:57:09] <Krinkle> its easy
[16:57:32] <gnarf> you say that, but trust me, most of these are automated pushes from release scripts
[16:57:34] <Krinkle> just put your name and email in ~/.gitignore and the key can stay on your local disk, ssh resolves locally if you connect with ssh -A
[16:57:43] <Krinkle> gnarf: Well those yes
[16:57:49] <Krinkle> but we wouldn't version automated things like latest or -git
[16:58:01] <Krinkle> oh from release scripts
[16:58:05] <Krinkle> sure, those can then go from jqadmin
[16:58:28] <Krinkle> and we can grant other team members access  as well, either to push from local workstation or forwarded from jq03
[16:58:56] <Krinkle> gnarf: those scripts run as jqadmin?
[16:59:12] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: who handles design again at jquery? https://github.com/jquery/qunitjs.com/issues/20
[16:59:14] <gnarf> they use scp jqadmin@....
[16:59:19] <Krinkle> okauy
[16:59:21] <Krinkle> I didn't know that
[16:59:22] <Krinkle> great :
[16:59:26] <Krinkle> :)
[17:00:39] <scott_gonzalez> heading home, back in a bit
[17:01:33] <Krinkle> gnarf: is there a common user group on jq03 for users like me ?
[17:01:39] <Krinkle> I thought jqadmin would be a group, but it isn't
[17:02:13] <gnarf> Krinkle: I believe you're in the "sysadmin" group with the rest of us
[17:02:15] <gnarf> we could make a grop
[17:02:45] <Krinkle> I find myself constantly having to do sudo, which is annoying
[17:02:46] <Krinkle> I'd much rather have things 775 on a common trusted group
[17:02:47] <Krinkle> jqdev ?
[17:03:14] <gnarf> Krinkle: all users with ssh are trusted
[17:03:35] <Krinkle> I know
[17:03:48] <Krinkle> but using unix default groups seems group
[17:03:51] <Krinkle> but using unix default groups seems wrong*
[17:04:06] <gnarf> Krinkle: the "wheel" group isn't actually a default on debian
[17:04:10] <gnarf> but its where we all are
[17:04:23] <gnarf> cat /etc/group | grep wheel
[17:04:28] <gnarf> except jqadmin
[17:04:30] <gnarf> damn
[17:04:40] <gnarf> i'll just add jqadmin
[17:04:45] <Krinkle> ok
[17:07:37] <Krinkle> umask 002 would be nice as a default as well
[17:09:43] <gnarf> Krinkle: been so long since i had to set that on a server
[17:09:57] <Krinkle> I just added it to my .bashrc
[17:10:03] <Krinkle> (a minute ago)
[17:10:30] <gnarf> so /etc/bashrc ?
[17:10:40] <Krinkle> Sure, that would work
[17:10:57] <Krinkle> Im so used to working on puppet managed servers, I'm afraid to touch central stuff like that
[17:11:17] <Krinkle> would be nice to have to be ensured by puppet
[17:11:31] <Krinkle> e.g. store the file in puppet and add it there
[17:11:41] <gnarf> doesn't appear to affect people in /etc/bashrc
[17:11:50] <Krinkle> log in and out
[17:11:53] <gnarf> Krinkle: I'd hate to override some users .bashrc
[17:11:54] <Krinkle> out and in*
[17:12:02] <Krinkle> gnarf: it doesn't' override anything
[17:12:12] <Krinkle> etc is loaded before ~
[17:12:24] <gnarf> Krinkle: i was testing with a new ssh connection
[17:12:45] <Krinkle> weird
[17:12:46] <Krinkle> try bash_profile maybe ?
[17:12:48] <Krinkle> does it work in your own .bashrc ?
[17:13:01] <gnarf> yeah
[17:13:28] <gnarf> its /etc/profile
[17:15:28] <Krinkle> I mean your ~/.bashrc does it work there
[17:15:32] <Krinkle> wait its in there so it works now?
[17:16:31] <gnarf> gnarf@jq03:~$ rm test.txt ; touch test.txt ; ls -al test.txt
[17:16:31] <gnarf> -rw-rw-r-- 1 gnarf wheel 0 Aug 30 17:16 test.txt
[17:17:00] <gnarf> Krinkle: it was /etc/profile, not /etc/bashrc
[17:17:04] <Krinkle> aha
[17:17:19] <gnarf> I need to set the user groups up better
[17:17:24] <Krinkle> yeah, it is a bit fuzzy with profile bash_profile and bashrc
[17:17:29] <gnarf> i like the jqadmin group idea
[17:17:47] <gnarf> might just rename wheel -> jqadmin
[17:17:47] <Krinkle> can a name be a use and group at the same time (I think so)
[17:17:49] <Krinkle> that'd be ideal
[17:18:02] <gnarf> Krinkle: yeah, actually by default each user gets his own group
[17:18:13] <Krinkle> of course
[17:18:17] <Krinkle> how can I forget
[17:18:39] <Krinkle> e.g. -rw-r--r-- krinkle krinkle
[17:19:00] <gnarf> i had to change the users default group to "wheel"
[17:19:03] <gnarf> but thats fine too
[17:19:07] <gnarf> i can do that via puppe
[17:19:16] <gnarf> for everyone real easily
[17:21:52] <Od1n> hi
[17:23:05] <Od1n> noticed a typo in http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery#Current_Release
[17:23:25] <Od1n> the href of the anchor "1.8.1 (Release Notes)" is wrong
[17:27:30] <Krinkle> gnarf: could I get access to docs.jquery.com (either set up a wiki account, or ssh to the server that hosts it) - would be handy if I can maintain that wiki a bit until we phase it out entirely
[17:27:31] <scott_gonzalez> Od1n: Thanks, I'll fix it
[17:27:35] <Krinkle> now it is mostly unmaintained I feel
[17:27:57] <gnarf> it is
[17:28:01] <gnarf> ill add your key to jqadmin
[17:28:07] <Krinkle> thx
[17:28:26] <Krinkle> ah, so I login with jqadmin like the old swarm server?
[17:28:30] <Krinkle> ok
[17:28:32] <scott_gonzalez> Od1n: Should be fixed now.
[17:28:49] <Od1n> yep I confirm, thanks
[17:28:56] <gnarf> Krinkle: you can jqadmin@docs.jquery.com
[17:30:32] <Krinkle> ok
[17:45:39] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Can you deploy stage.learn.jquery.com?
[17:46:37] <scott_gonzalez> Unless someone else is around who has nanoc setup.
[17:48:35] <Krinkle> gnarf: ok, I've created a Krinkle user on the wiki ( fyi: php maintenace/createAndPromote.php )
[17:48:42] <Krinkle> in the mw dir
[18:02:16] <Krinkle> gnarf: http://docs.jquery.com/Special:Version?useskin=standard
[18:02:17] <Krinkle> :D
[18:02:46] <Krinkle> yes, Wikipedia looked like that in 2003
[18:03:06] <Krinkle> no, 2001
[18:03:48] <Krinkle> no it was 2003
[18:03:51] <Krinkle> 2001 was http://docs.jquery.com/Special:Version?useskin=nostalgia
[18:03:54] <Krinkle> https://nostalgia.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomePage
[19:18:43] <Od1n> hi
[19:19:12] <Od1n> sorry it's me again, http://jquery.com/download/ needs to be updated for 1.8.1 ;-)
[19:21:51] <Od1n> by the way, from http://jquery.com/ the "Download" tab links to http://jquery.com/download/, whereas from http://blog.jquery.com/ this tab links to http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery
[23:52:54] <despott_> any idea when 1.8.1 will be available though googleapis?
