[07:45:21] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Quote reserved keyword 'throws' to satisfy yui compressor. Fixes #12158. - Timmy Willison
[07:54:32] <jzaefferer> timmywil: meh, they should fixed yuicompressor instead, throws isn't reserved in ecmascript5 and was only an extra in 3 (or something like that)
[07:56:00] <timmywil> jzaefferer: I wasn't going to spend a lot of time on it, but it was easy enough to fix
[07:57:43] <jaubourg> except it won't work if someone has the minified version into the yui compressor
[07:58:11] <jaubourg> which can happen when people build the infamous single production file for their site
[07:58:28] <timmywil> jaubourg: doesn't that defeat the purpose of using yui compressor if they already have a file smaller than yui can make?
[07:58:50] <timmywil> they have a lot more problems if they try to validate the min
[07:59:22] <jaubourg> I was just pointing out we shouldn't change jQuery for this and ask for YUI to fix it
[07:59:54] <jaubourg> sets a bad precedent and doesn't solve the problem, only hides it
[08:00:00] <jaubourg> and hi :)
[08:00:03] <jaubourg> missed me right?
[08:00:05] * jaubourg hides
[08:00:12] <timmywil> hi :)
[08:01:08] <timmywil> I don't think I agree that it sets a bad precendent. If it is understood that throws was once a reserved keyword, there could be a legitimate reason for quoting it.
[08:01:48] <timmywil> I think yui should be changed as well.
[08:01:49] <jaubourg> really? does uglify leaves it quoted? If not, we just don't support versions of ecmascript that have throws as a reserved keyword
[08:02:02] <jaubourg> that's the key here imo
[08:02:48] <jaubourg> if uglifies quotes it then I'm fine with having it quoted in non minified, but I seriously doubt it ;)
[08:03:35] <timmywil> the fact is we have users that use yui compressor to compress all of their code. the latest yui compressor takes issue with throws, so for now, we can quote the two times we use it until they fix it. this is mainly what I'm saying.
[08:05:11] <timmywil> but no, uglify leaves it unquoted
[08:06:07] <jaubourg> timmywil: except there is no incentive for yui compressor to be fixed anymore. This sets a bad precedent because we're just saying: "you can screw your minifier, if it's popular enough, we'll just fix it in jQuery". "throws" does NOT need to be quoted in our supported environments, so we shouldn't quote it. We have enough of browser workarounds not to add ones for minifier being silly... some unavoidable mobile carriers mess
[08:06:07] <jaubourg> nonewithstanding
[08:06:51] <timmywil> we are in rc. If we were in beta, I'd be more inclined to try to get yui fixed before we release.
[08:07:14] <jaubourg> we didn't release yet, let's petition YUI to fix their code
[08:07:42] <jaubourg> not that it's an end-of-the-world issue, mind you
[08:07:49] <timmywil> well, we agree we should petition
[08:08:00] <jaubourg> we should tell them we won't fix it
[08:08:12] <jaubourg> because there is nothing broken in jQuery
[08:08:25] <jaubourg> now we have the commit so heh
[08:09:18] <jaubourg> hmm, and it's escalating into "let's rename the option" now :(
[08:10:28] <jaubourg> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Reserved_Words
[08:10:33] <jaubourg> pretty clear to me anyway
[08:14:56] <timmywil> I'm creating a ticket on yui
[08:16:11] <jaubourg> sounds good to me

[08:42:02] <timmywil> jzaefferer: good to know, glad we have a ticket just for throws
[08:42:15] <jzaefferer> yeah, makes sense to keep that
[09:48:15] <timmywil> jaubourg: oh, someone on the yui did "own" the ticket since it's been made
[09:48:42] <timmywil> I was confused cause it was originally "assigned" to someone for review
[09:48:51] <timmywil> so yay!
[09:51:03] <jaubourg> heh
[09:51:10] <jaubourg> priority is high too
[09:51:13] <jaubourg> so \o/
[14:42:14] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: what postfix do you guys use for alphas and betas?
[14:42:21] <johnbender> -alpha.1 ?
[14:42:32] <johnbender> -a.1?
[14:42:56] <DaveMethvin> on the file? It's like jquery-1.8b1
[14:43:06] <DaveMethvin> johnbender: ^
[14:43:06] <b-ot> DaveMethvin, you have one new message, just say “read” to me when you wish to read it.
[14:43:15] <DaveMethvin> b-ot: read
[14:43:20] <b-ot> DaveMethvin, from bot-t, 1h 50m ago: that vacation time".
[14:43:33] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: wrong window
[14:43:34] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: kk, semver says that it has to be a dash then the specifier so it looks odd with just the letter I guess
[14:44:29] <DaveMethvin> johnbender: yeah with the major versions we're not very consistent, it should be 1.8.0-rc1 or something
[14:44:56] <DaveMethvin> that would be the least of our problems :)
[14:45:07] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: :D fair enough
[14:45:19] <johnbender> agcolom: kk, -alpha.1 it is
[14:45:21] <johnbender> agh
[14:45:23] <johnbender> wrong window again
[14:45:25] <johnbender> sigh
[14:45:36] <johnbender> stick windows in irssi are great if you just want to watch a channel
[14:48:10] <agcolom> johnbender: ok, so 1.2.0-alpha.1?
[19:34:29] <gibson042> .
