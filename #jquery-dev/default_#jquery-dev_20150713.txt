[08:31:52] <markelog> timmywil: hey there, i probably not gonna make to the meeting, please ping me up if there something important or if i required to do something 
[08:55:03] <timmywil> markelog: np
[09:01:05] <timmywil> gibson042: I see you
[09:01:28] <gibson042> I see you too :)
[09:16:59] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, gibson042: Perhaps we should move up the Promises section. Maybe after the show/hide explanation?
[09:17:19] <DaveMethvin> i think that makes sense, it's big news
[09:17:27] <arthurvr> :+1:
[09:18:30] <gibson042> yeah, sort by decreasing relevance to the average reader
[09:19:20] <gibson042> I think that looks like show/hide, Deferred, .data keys, exception throwing, fractional dimensions, private method removal, other
[09:20:13] <timmywil> gibson042: I gave you editing access.
[09:20:27] <gibson042> ok
[09:22:16] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: on the "unhandled rejection", I forgot about that. Did we decide to add a default error handler?
[09:22:38] <DaveMethvin> i put a comment in the original PR, let me find it
[09:23:01] <gibson042> I was going to prototype an "unhandled rejections" plugin, but have not yet done so
[09:23:28] <timmywil> oh yea
[09:25:45] <DaveMethvin> i can't find it right now
[09:26:27] <DaveMethvin> i was thinking of something really dumb and simple like a console.log on exceptions
[09:26:36] <DaveMethvin> but total silence is gonna drive people batty
[09:26:58] <DaveMethvin> even just filtering out the JavaScript rejections and logging those would improve debugging
[09:26:58] <timmywil> it is, unfortunately, the norm, right?
[09:27:33] <DaveMethvin> sorry, got to run right now but i'll be back in about 30
[09:27:37] <timmywil> ok
[09:27:39] <DaveMethvin> minutes that is :)
[09:28:00] <timmywil> good, 30 days is too long
[09:34:42] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: that's not a blocker for alpha release, though, right?
[09:35:34] <timmywil> I don't think so
[09:38:54] <timmywil> gibson042: I think I've got the order worked out.
[09:39:07] <timmywil> I like ending with a performance boost
[09:39:59] <gibson042> I think .data changes should precede AJAX method changes
[09:41:43] <gibson042> +1 on ending with perf, though
[09:42:15] <timmywil> I figured I'd stick the two Deferred-related sections next to each other.
[09:42:50] <gibson042> hmmm
[09:43:24] <gibson042> the second section reads to me like AJAX instead of Deferred, but if you want to keep them together then I'd move .data() above them
[09:43:59] <timmywil> actually, yea, I'll just put data between them
[09:58:13] <DaveMethvin> lgtm now
[09:58:37] <gibson042> I'm working over the Deferred section; will comment when it's updated
[10:33:03] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15timmywil closed issue #2365: Remove or document jQuery.fn.{push,sort,splice} 02http://git.io/vkMJn
[10:45:53] <markelog> timmywil: On the push, slice... methods, i think we could document them, but say that we don't want ppl to use them or use them for debug purposes only
[10:46:52] <markelog> also, timmywil: i can put a list of links of the github handles for the contributors
[10:47:00] <markelog> could you send me a list?
[10:47:25] <timmywil> we discussed that option, but I think documenting them as internal use only still endorses them to a degree. gibson042, DaveMethvin, and I prefer to leave it as-is.
[10:48:05] <timmywil> and, sure, a list of links would be helpful. thanks, markelog .
[10:48:59] <markelog> timmywil: yeah, i saw the discussion, just wanted to express my opinion even if doesn't leads anywhere, as i usually do :-)
[10:49:19] <markelog> timmywil: will you send me a list?
[10:49:25] <timmywil> that is appreciated.
[10:49:47] <timmywil> sometimes we'll disagree, which is fine. :)
[10:50:10] <timmywil> and sure. I think I've got a list somewhere.
[10:52:14] <markelog> timmywil: yeah, totally, i think it is good to consider all perspectives and make an appropriate
[10:52:20] <markelog> choice
[10:52:35] <timmywil> Emailed you the list
[10:53:35] <markelog> i see, give me an half an hour or so
[10:58:58] <markelog> timmywil: "Core: revert addition of createHTMLDocument. Thanks, Safari 8." i guess that shouldn't be in the list :-)
[10:59:38] <timmywil> yea, the contributor generation is not perfect :P
[10:59:51] <timmywil> unless you can find someone by that name
[10:59:51] <markelog> timmywil: will we need to remove jquery members from that list?
[10:59:55] <markelog> ))
[11:00:15] <timmywil> I don't think so
[11:00:27] <timmywil> They'll all be bundled together
[11:01:16] <markelog> ok-ok

[12:36:47] <timmywil> that's odd. maybe compat-only?
[12:37:15] <markelog> nope
[12:37:26] <timmywil> We'll just list the name then
[12:38:29] <markelog> i don't see a commit with this name
[12:38:40] <markelog> Are we sure he contirbuted?
[12:39:14] <timmywil> Contribution doesn't necessarily mean commit.
[12:39:28] <markelog> he signed cla
[12:39:31] <timmywil> The script looks at github comments as well
[12:39:35] <markelog> wows
[12:39:48] <markelog> how
[12:39:49] <markelog> ?
[12:40:02] <timmywil> I'm not sure
[12:40:08] <markelog> github also doesn't no the guy
[12:40:17] <markelog> nor email nor fullname can't find it
[12:40:46] <markelog> it seems it is this user - https://github.com/upisfree
[12:40:58] <timmywil> possibly girl? Anyway, I'd rather include someone erroneously than exclude someone
[12:41:12] <markelog> nuh, guy Russian name )
[12:41:19] <markelog> oaky
[12:41:21] <markelog> okay
[12:41:24] <timmywil> ok, I guess I'm thinking of Sonya
[12:41:37] <markelog> not 100% though
[12:41:47] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1607 then?
[12:42:04] <markelog> Thank you!
[12:42:05] <timmywil> nice, arthurvr 
[12:42:16] <markelog> and i pushed it )
[12:42:32] <markelog> correct dash )
[12:42:35] <timmywil> strange you couldn't find it in the logs
[12:43:01] <arthurvr> it was commited with a wrong name: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/df62159296e9de8b04653ba999a32f9be7bb2a73.patch
[12:43:02] <markelog> incorrect git author
[12:43:09] <arthurvr> yep
[12:43:09] <markelog> before cla was in the place
[12:43:18] <timmywil> still, we should be able to search by email
[12:43:27] <timmywil> hence the mailmap entry
[12:43:37] <markelog> searched only by the name
[12:43:41] <timmywil> ah ok
[12:44:01] <timmywil> well, they get a mention
[12:44:02] <timmywil> :)
[12:44:30] <markelog> yeah, funny
[12:49:30] <gibson042> timmywil: should we mention removing load, unload, and error event aliases?
[12:50:53] <gibson042> or :visible/:hidden changes?
[12:53:01] <markelog> timmywil: just send a reply with the list
[12:53:31] <markelog> I think next time, we should note "Breaking" in the commits
[12:53:45] <markelog> would be easier to filter, then through github issues
[12:55:47] <gibson042> I've been considering a proposal to go even farther, capturing on each commit the semver field that should be incremented
[12:56:24] <markelog> each commit, what if it docs change?
[12:56:28] <gibson042> so "Breaking" == "MAJOR", but we also get to filter on backwards-compatible additions with "MINOR"
[12:56:48] <gibson042> same goes for docs
[12:57:33] <markelog> We could do something like that, as "Version: Major" easier to filter and without any uppercase
[12:57:43] <gibson042> yes
[12:58:44] <markelog> if change build process or something else internal, we could not include that line in the commit
[12:59:10] <markelog> might be better for the changelog generation
[12:59:11] <markelog> too
[12:59:34] <gibson042> my thoughts exactly
[12:59:39] <timmywil> gibson042: yea, we should mention the event aliases
[13:00:25] <timmywil> We do have the "Behavior Change" for issues
[13:00:30] <timmywil> label
[13:02:49] <gibson042> adding the section now
[13:03:34] <markelog> timmywil: yeah, but with new version it is not easy as git describe
[13:04:31] <timmywil> Practically speaking, I suspect we'd often forget to add something like that to the commit message, but we can always go back and add a label to an issue.
[13:05:11] <timmywil> And we generally link to issues in the blog post.
[13:07:57] <timmywil> gibson042: all set?
[13:08:15] <gibson042> unless we also want to mention :visible/:hidden changes
[13:08:30] <timmywil> I'm ok without
[13:08:47] <gibson042> then LGTM
[13:09:01] <timmywil> cool
