[04:41:39] <jzaefferer> ?tell davemethvin At least on iOS, $(window).innerHeight() != window.innerHeight - is there anything we can do about that? It looks like window.innerHeight is actually useful.
[04:41:40] <bot-t> jzaefferer, Okay.
[05:08:47] <mikesherov> .
[08:28:40] <rwaldron> .
[09:03:16] <nacin> rwaldron: why does the bot here wait until you say something to give you messages? can't it just do it when you sign onto freenode?
[09:03:38] <gibson042> bot-t: explain yourself!
[09:03:40] <bot-t> gibson042, #7231 ($.fn.data and html5 data- attributes - broken implementation ... - Opened 6 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7231
[09:12:53] <rwaldron> nacin i don't know
[09:12:58] <rwaldron> i didn't write it
[10:07:06] <snover> nacin: because people use bouncers and sometimes accidentally sign on and then quit immediately and so on, so if it delivered messages immediately they might not actually be around to see it
[10:08:38] <nacin> snover: I see. our bot delivers messages immediately, and I've never noticed that to be a problem. there is probably also a middle ground, such as waiting a few moments.
[10:08:59] <snover> you are the first person that has ever complained :)
[10:09:18] <nacin> snover: not complaining; it just took me a bit to figure out why people kept sending .
[10:09:31] <snover> oh well, that’s because they are too lazy to PM the bot for messages
[10:09:32] <snover> or say
[10:09:37] <snover> bot-t: hey sexy, do i have any messages?
[10:09:37] <bot-t> snover, :)
[10:09:51] <nacin> heh.
[10:09:52] <snover> cheeky.
[10:23:22] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez: thanks and good catch
[10:23:32] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[10:23:36] <rwaldron> <-- dummy
[10:23:47] <rwaldron> danheberden do we have a  public build of 1.8pre?
[10:23:48] <scott_gonzalez> I just got core trac setup properly to send me emails again :-)
[10:24:01] <rwaldron> like... http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8pre.js?
[10:24:08] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez oh, nice
[10:24:31] <scott_gonzalez> I remember gnarf and danheberden talking about that at Dev Days, but I don't think it's setup yet.
[10:24:39] <scott_gonzalez> I bet if you bug gnarf enough he'll do it.
[10:24:39] <rwaldron> yeah, same ehre
[10:24:49] * rwaldron bugging gnarf
[10:24:51] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: do it.
[10:24:52] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: do it.
[10:24:53] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: do it.
[10:25:02] <rwaldron> gnarf!?
[10:25:29] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell gnarf It's hard to bug you when you're not here ;-)
[10:25:29] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Okay.
[10:28:31] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez boom http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/aXAE8/
[10:28:40] <rwaldron> thanks for the heads up
[10:28:44] <rwaldron> the ticket is closed.
[10:28:46] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[10:32:33] <gnarf> rwaldron: scott_gonzalez yeah - thats part of the plan
[10:32:33] <bot-t> (7 mins 4 secs ago) <scott_gonzalez> tell gnarf It's hard to bug you when you're not here ;-)
[10:32:35] <gnarf> we may or may not put it on the cdn
[10:47:23] <gnarf> I'll see if I can't connect with danheberden and at least set up a "staging build" for it
[10:47:48] <gnarf> on like http://jq04.stage.jquery.com/core/jquery-1.8pre.js or something
[10:48:10] <gnarf> i really want to get it to work from a post commit hook in github tho
[11:31:31] <scott_gonzalez> Should I do: wordpress.editPost( id, data ) or wordpress.editPost( data ) with id in the data?
[11:31:58] <scott_gonzalez> The underlying WP API is editPost( id, data )
[11:33:26] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: you switched channels. :-) Looking.
[11:33:51] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Keeping you on your toes :-)
[11:34:06] <scott_gonzalez> I switched because the consumers of the API are in here.
[11:34:49] <nacin> FWIW, the WP API does data as a single argument for this.
[11:35:03] <nacin> id in the data
[11:35:46] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm..the XML-RPC API is (id, data)
[11:36:12] <nacin> is it? I am thinking about our core API, but let me check on RPC
[11:37:01] <scott_gonzalez> int blog_id, string username, string password, int post_id, struct content
[11:37:11] <nacin> yes, you are correct
[11:37:25] <nacin> that probably makes more sense
[11:39:47] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: XML-RPC API is a whole lot easier than the straight DB. It also works better.
[11:39:57] <nacin> I sure hope.
[11:40:41] <scott_gonzalez> I've got create, edit, and delete post implemented now. Each one is a single line.
[11:41:01] <nacin> we like making it hard for you.
[11:41:57] <scott_gonzalez> I think I can actually abstract this to the point where my code is just an array of function names.
[11:42:45] <scott_gonzalez> Though that'd make it really hard to understand what's going on :P
[11:47:10] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, can't do that. The get methods require code...
[15:59:18] <LakWork> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7579 "closed bug: wontfix" ???? REALLY?
[16:01:28] <snover> LakWork: I beat that horse to death before.
[16:02:33] <LakWork> lol
[16:03:32] <LakWork> that's a really unpleasant implementation
[16:03:54] <snover> yes.
[16:04:35] <LakWork> really doesn't make much sense to not have an overload of the data which disables that functionality
[16:05:03] <LakWork> if it had been designed correctly, it never would have had conversion be the default behavior, but at least at this point it should have an option to NOT convert
[16:11:17] <snover> LakWork: the option to not convert is to use $.data directly
[16:12:52] <snover> LakWork: needless to say, one of the design goals of jQuery is making life easy for people that don’t understand how Web stuff really works, and from that perspective the feature makes sense
[16:14:36] <LakWork> mmm that makes sense
[16:14:52] <snover> (uncoincidentally I don’t use jQuery very much these days)
[16:14:59] <LakWork> haha
[17:17:08] <jqcommit> [jquery] jaubourg pushed 3 new commits to 1.8pre: http://git.io/D2D5uA
[17:17:08] <jqcommit> [jquery/1.8pre] Uses a copy of the flags when they are given as an object rather than the object itself. That way, we're sure flags are immutable for the entire lifetime of the Callbacks instance. - jaubourg

[18:23:22] <mikesherov> rwaldron: you here?
[18:32:02] <rwaldron> mikesherov i am, sort of
[18:32:09] <rwaldron> futzing
[18:32:13] <rwaldron> whats up?
[18:32:33] <mikesherov> I started working on stuff that assumes the IIFE's are gone
[18:33:08] <mikesherov> obviously, you're doing the work there, but I started a branch that assumes you already did your work
[18:33:34] <mikesherov> It's nice, because the old jshint check also checks only the combined file, and the unit tests (if ran with PHP), already assume one file
[18:34:05] <mikesherov> so obviously, we want to get to grunt on windows too, but just letting you know there is no pressure from me on my side working without it just yet
[18:34:17] <rwaldron> hrm
[18:35:04] <rwaldron> i'm not sure I understand why you'd start coding against a thing that hasn't even proven itself
[18:35:12] <rwaldron> also, we need to address this grunt on windows thing
[18:35:20] <rwaldron> that seems more important
[18:35:27] <rwaldron> then sans-IIFE
[18:37:36] <mikesherov> sure, I mean, it's just an experiment
[18:37:43] <mikesherov> just to see the potential benefits
[18:38:24] <rwaldron> I'll show you potential benefits!
[18:38:29] * rwaldron shakes fists
[18:38:52] <rwaldron> I'm giving myself "night school"
[18:39:03] <rwaldron> its been a decade since I was in a class room
[18:39:19] <rwaldron> so I am reading through SICP from cover to cover
[18:39:53] <mikesherov_> back
[18:40:32] <mikesherov_> rwaldron: LOL, just read your responses in irc.jquery.com
[18:40:51] <rwaldron> mikesherov_ to what? when?
[18:41:08] <mikesherov_> 	I'll show you potential benefits!	18:38 * rwaldron shakes fists
[18:41:08] <rwaldron> you just went from a lovely pink to dark blue.
[18:41:17] <snover> an equally lovely dark blue?
[18:41:20] <mikesherov_> LOL
[18:41:24] <rwaldron> snover naw
[18:41:28] <rwaldron> blue is dumb.
[18:41:35] <rwaldron> because i hate facebook
[18:41:44] <rwaldron> not the website
[18:41:46] <snover> aww. poor zuck is going to be decimated
[18:41:47] <mikesherov_> yeah, so basically, I'm very interested in getting grunt working on windows
[18:41:47] <rwaldron> the employees
[18:42:06] <rwaldron> me too.
[18:42:11] <rwaldron> jesus.
[18:42:17] <rwaldron> get with it.
[18:42:29] <mikesherov_> I was just saying that I don't need it at the moment to do what we discussed in the Monday meeting
[18:42:41] <mikesherov_> ARGH, you're maddening
[18:42:47] <rwaldron> me?
[18:42:47] <mikesherov_> :-P
[18:42:57] <mikesherov_> no, my wireless card
[18:43:02] <rwaldron> I'll say
[18:43:05] <mikesherov_> and you
[18:43:09] <mikesherov_> :-P
[18:43:11] <rwaldron> 9:42 PM] ← mikesherov left IRC. (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[18:43:11] <rwaldron> [9:42 PM] <rwaldron> jesus.
[18:43:11] <rwaldron> [9:42 PM] <rwaldron> get with it.
[18:43:24] <mikesherov_> LOL
[18:43:34] <mikesherov_> ok, we're at cross purposes now
[18:43:40] <mikesherov_> sorry for wasitng your time
[18:43:50] <mikesherov_> I'll go back to my cave now.
[18:44:21] <mikesherov_> sindresorhus: sindresorhus_: is one of you here?
[18:44:41] <sindresorhus_> mikesherov_: yo
[18:45:51] <rwaldron> mikesherov_ aaaaaaaaa
[18:45:54] <rwaldron> no, come back
[18:46:05] <mikesherov_> OK, I'm back
[18:46:10] <rwaldron> hi
[18:46:21] <rwaldron> so tell me what the hell is going on with windows
[18:46:27] <rwaldron> you have the nodez
[18:46:32] <rwaldron> obviously
[18:46:38] <mikesherov_> Right, OK, so let me get the output, and tell you how I'm configged
[18:46:46] <mikesherov_> first, now don't kill me, I'm on XP
[18:46:49] <rwaldron> yes, pastie that
[18:46:54] <rwaldron> whatevs
[18:47:00] <rwaldron> your loss
[18:47:03] <mikesherov_> LOL
[18:47:09] <rwaldron> but we have to make something work
[18:47:38] <mikesherov_> sure, so I'm using cygwin, which was installed by git, and I've also installed node
[18:48:10] <mikesherov_> installed grunt using "npm install -g grunt"
[18:48:30] <rwaldron> ok
[18:48:33] <rwaldron> so far, so good
[18:49:08] <mikesherov_> I go to the jquery folder and run "grunt"
[18:49:09] <mikesherov_> WideCharToMultiByte: The data area passed to a system call is too small. Error: Cannot find module '/cygdrive/c/xampp/htdocs/jquery/c:/Documents and Sett ings/mike/Application Data/npm/node_modules/grunt/bin/grunt'
[18:49:11] <rwaldron> then in /jquery/ dir, you run npm install
[18:49:33] <rwaldron> oh well. fuck sticks
[18:49:44] <mikesherov_> wait, wait a sec
[18:49:54] <mikesherov_> I didn't do "npm install" inside jquery
[18:50:00] <rwaldron> yeah, do that
[18:50:03] <mikesherov_> doing that now
[18:50:08] <rwaldron> there are some deps in there
[18:50:25] <mikesherov_> so, did that, installed a bunch of stuff, same error
[18:50:49] <rwaldron> ohhhh
[18:50:54] <rwaldron> look: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/nodejs/F2yzeJkbBF4
[18:51:19] <mikesherov_> loading.... stupid wireless card
[18:51:20] <mikesherov_> ugh, I need a new laptop
[18:53:05] <mikesherov_> interesting
[18:53:15] <mikesherov_> I thought it just couldn't find the file...
[18:54:17] <rwaldron> If Brendan had really been allowed to write "Scheme for the Netscape" as he was promised, we would be doing this...
[18:54:37] <rwaldron> (get-element-by-id "foo")
[18:54:42] <rwaldron> maybe
[18:55:05] <rwaldron> it's hard to think of programming the web in another language
[18:55:10] <mikesherov_> so, it's definitely looking in the wrong place
[18:55:27] <mikesherov_> '/cygdrive/c/xampp/htdocs/jquery/c:/Documents and Sett ings/mike/Application Data/npm/node_modules/grunt/bin/grunt' SHOULD BE:
[18:55:41] <mikesherov_> '/cygdrive/c/Documents and Settings/mike/Application Data/npm/node_modules/grunt/bin/grunt'
[18:55:50] <rwaldron> where to change?
[18:55:55] <rwaldron> you should document this
[18:56:03] <mikesherov_> I have no idea where to change that
[18:56:09] <mikesherov_> I will definitely document it
[18:56:20] <mikesherov_> I have no idea how to change where it's looking for the file
[18:56:52] <mikesherov_> so, maybe I'm on to something:
[18:58:48] <mikesherov_> I just need to find where grunt.cmd is
[19:03:55] <mikesherov_> progress, it's in the bash version of the script: C:\Documents and Settings\mike\Application Data\npm\grunt
[19:04:04] <mikesherov_> which maks sense for cygwin
[19:04:08] <mikesherov_> makes*
[19:05:59] <mikesherov_> success, sort of
[19:06:06] <mikesherov_> I can now get grunt to FAIL
[19:06:14] <rwaldron> that's awesome
[19:06:27] <mikesherov_> $ grunt >> Local Npm module "grunt-compare-size" not found. Is it installed? <WARN> Task "compare_size" not found. Use --force to continue. </WARN>  Aborted due to warnings.
[19:06:34] <mikesherov_> I'll continue hacking away
[19:06:41] <mikesherov_> I'll have an answer by the morning rick
[19:24:36] <rwaldron> ?tell mikesherov now you need to "npm install" from within jquery dir
[19:24:36] <bot-t> rwaldron, Okay.
