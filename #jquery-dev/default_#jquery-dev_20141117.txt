[09:31:21] <arthurvr> Hi guys!
[09:31:31] <arthurvr> Seems like there are many many open PRs in the learn.jquery.com repo but nobody ever looks at it. Kinda stupid for the people spending time to open those.
[09:32:14] <arthurvr> Some are open for months but without any comment
[10:46:17] <m_gol> `tell DaveMethvin I need feedback about an ancient bug from you; ping me when you have a moment
[10:46:18] <b-ot> m_gol: Iâ€™ll tell DaveMethvin about that.
[11:58:14] <m_gol> arschmitz: it seems Intel fixed their kernel module for running Android x86 emulators
[11:58:47] <m_gol> arschmitz: the Android 2.3 emulator is now so snappy! before I had to wait 2 seconds for each typed letter to appear in the address bar
[11:59:23] <m_gol> arschmitz: it's, like, infinitely better than what I had to experience before :D
[11:59:46] <arschmitz> m_gol: wow really
[11:59:54] <arschmitz> ill check it out
