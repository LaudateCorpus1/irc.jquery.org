[13:00:47] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: Do you think there's anyone at Google that would be willing to look into jQuery memory leaks?
[13:01:11] <scott_gonzalez> We seem to have an incredibly hard time tracking them down and verifying.
[13:01:12] <paul_irish> that ticket that was filed this morning?
[13:01:42] <scott_gonzalez> Well, there's that, and http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4188
[13:02:26] <paul_irish> short answer is i doubt it
[13:03:11] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe someone at Microsoft, though they seem to be mostly concerned with IE9/10
[13:03:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'll ping them and see what they say.
[13:06:33] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez: are there leaks in chrome?
[13:06:53] <scott_gonzalez> I believe we've fixed any leaks that existed in Chrome.
[13:07:22] <scott_gonzalez> At least the last time I looked into this (maybe half a year ago), I confirmed that we had a memory leak in Chrome with old versions of UI that no longer existed.
[13:07:36] <paul_irish> cool
[13:07:51] <paul_irish> if it were up to me i would add memory leaks for IE6
[13:08:36] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[13:08:46] <scott_gonzalez> Supposedly this exists in at least IE7 as well.
[13:09:12] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, and IE8 according to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/513

[19:08:26] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8157
[19:08:48] <scott_gonzalez> Is core handling this now?
[19:09:20] <DaveMethvin> yes, should be good on master scott_gonzalez
[19:09:25] <DaveMethvin> we clamp to 0
[19:09:45] <scott_gonzalez> For all or based on property?
[19:10:06] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully based on prop.
[19:10:07] <DaveMethvin> based on property, i'll have to check the list
[19:10:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah, margin etc can be neg
[19:10:40] <scott_gonzalez> gah, I hate that jquery-git.js is broken. It's how I search code :-P
[19:11:02] <DaveMethvin> yes, i agree
[19:11:14] <DaveMethvin> i was thinking about ghetto ways to fix it
[19:11:23] <DaveMethvin> like commit a change to the makefile that would install grunt
[19:11:51] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[19:12:11] <DaveMethvin> it just might work
[19:12:24] <scott_gonzalez> I actually think that there's probably a single cron script that builds ui and core.
[19:12:30] <scott_gonzalez> And I think it might build UI first.
[19:12:38] <scott_gonzalez> Because jquery-git and jquery-ui-git stopped working on the same day.
[19:12:51] <DaveMethvin> btw margins seem to be the only values allowed negative
[19:12:53] <scott_gonzalez> And we landed grunt before core.
[19:13:11] <scott_gonzalez> Where is the clamping?
[19:13:15] <DaveMethvin> in css.js
[19:13:23] <DaveMethvin> setPositiveNumber
[19:13:28] <scott_gonzalez> Although, we may have left ant in, and it broke when core added grunt.
[19:13:30] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure.
[19:13:56] <DaveMethvin> man today isn't a bad day, i have the pull queue down to 4 and my inbox down to 10
[19:14:15] <DaveMethvin> i'm afraid to sleep now
[19:14:47] <scott_gonzalez> hmm..
[19:14:55] <scott_gonzalez> So we'll need to add more in UI.
[19:15:01] <scott_gonzalez> That ticket contains a ton of properties.
[19:15:14] <DaveMethvin> that can be negative?
[19:15:20] <scott_gonzalez> That can't be negative.
[19:15:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah i don't know how many can be validly negative ... right now we only look for margin but it's a regexp
[19:16:14] <scott_gonzalez> border-spacing, font-size, min-width, max-width, min-height, max-height, line-height, outline-width, widows
[19:16:23] <DaveMethvin> letter-spacing
[19:17:03] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[19:17:12] <scott_gonzalez> letter-spacing can't be negative?
[19:17:17] <DaveMethvin> letter spacing can
[19:17:22] <scott_gonzalez> I know there's a bug with letter-spacing, but it's not a non-negative bug.
[19:17:32] <DaveMethvin> you can have letters overlapping
[19:17:37] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[19:17:37] <DaveMethvin> i recall from some other situation
[19:17:40] <scott_gonzalez> for extra readability
[19:17:44] <DaveMethvin> lol
[19:17:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, from http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8627
[19:17:58] <scott_gonzalez> GUESS WHO REPORTED IT!
[19:18:14] <DaveMethvin> that guy, i ignore hijm
[19:18:14] <scott_gonzalez> That guy is such a jerk.
[19:18:21] <DaveMethvin> takes one to know one
[19:18:53] <DaveMethvin> so if we are going to fix the problem at all, i think it's better to have a short list of plausibly negative ones
[19:19:14] <DaveMethvin> i would almost prefer to wait for someone to report a bug
[19:19:25] <DaveMethvin> or come up with some workaround for them
[19:19:34] <DaveMethvin> i hate to have some big-ass list of properties
[19:19:59] <scott_gonzalez> That's what http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8157 is :-P
[19:20:19] <DaveMethvin> its the opposite
[19:20:44] <scott_gonzalez> How so?
[19:20:58] <DaveMethvin> our list atm is the ones that can be negative
[19:21:06] <DaveMethvin> not the ones that can't
[19:22:01] <scott_gonzalez> Are you sure?
[19:22:09] <DaveMethvin> no
[19:22:12] <scott_gonzalez> setPositiveNumber says you're wrong :-P
[19:22:16] <DaveMethvin> yesh
[19:22:22] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise it'd be called doAbsolutelyNothing :-P
[19:22:51] <scott_gonzalez> The list is at the bottom of css.js
[19:22:52] <DaveMethvin> yeah i forgot what we landed
[19:23:05] <DaveMethvin> padding, border, width, height
[19:23:39] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[19:23:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine landing the remaining ones in UI if core doesn't want the bytes.
[19:24:32] <DaveMethvin> lemme check that list
[19:24:39] <scott_gonzalez> We're just a big fat ball of bloat anyway :-)
[19:25:04] <DaveMethvin> like, i want to find out how long before someone reports a bug with column-rule-width :)
[19:25:16] <DaveMethvin> marquee-play-count????
[19:26:34] <DaveMethvin> so, the question is whether/how these would go negative, the bouncy animations could do it
[19:26:54] <DaveMethvin> but how many of those are plausibly animatable scott_gonzalez
[19:28:07] <scott_gonzalez> Probably not marquee-play-count.
[19:28:17] <scott_gonzalez> Or device-*
[19:28:34] <mikesherov> .
[19:28:38] <scott_gonzalez> Not even sure what widows is.
[19:28:46] <DaveMethvin> widow orphan control i think
[19:29:19] <scott_gonzalez> Number of lines that can appear on a page.
[19:29:21] <mikesherov> widows and orphans are print terminology
[19:29:24] <scott_gonzalez> Definitely not being animated.
[19:29:48] <mikesherov> I'm fairly certain by drfinition they can't be useful for animation
[19:29:53] <scott_gonzalez> I had only heard of widows in reference to a single word on a line, not lines on a page.
[19:30:23] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, seems fine to leave that out.
[19:30:31] <scott_gonzalez> So, I'd say most, but not all, are sane to cover.
[19:31:47] <DaveMethvin> in core i'd be fine with waiting for someone to report a problem
[19:31:57] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll add them to UI.
[19:32:03] <DaveMethvin> i think we got the big ones with padding, border
[19:32:21] <mikesherov> wait, what?
[19:32:27] <mikesherov> are we talking about setPositiveNumber?
[19:32:30] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[19:32:41] <mikesherov> and so what's the issue?
[19:32:55] <DaveMethvin> crazy people want to set negative values for some css props
[19:33:13] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8157#comment:2
[19:33:18] <DaveMethvin> like if you animated line-height with a bounce animation
[19:33:30] <mikesherov> Oh, I see
[19:33:51] <mikesherov> and so we're thiniing about implementing setPositiveNumber as more cssHooks?
[19:33:53] <scott_gonzalez> It's not even bounce, you have to use a negative easing like elastic.
[19:33:58] <scott_gonzalez> or ease*Back
[19:34:03] <DaveMethvin> right
[19:34:07] <DaveMethvin> something that undershoots
[19:34:38] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know that it wasn't until I refactored all of the easings that I noticed the word easing is in increasing and decreasing?
[19:34:40] <scott_gonzalez> Isn't that sad?
[19:35:08] <DaveMethvin> TIL
[19:35:16] <scott_gonzalez> Also a few weeks later I realized that the word ease is in disease.
[19:35:29] <mikesherov> Yeah, the only reason setPositiveNumber even existed for margin, padding, and border is because gnarf wanted an "expand" hook
[19:35:31] <scott_gonzalez> And suddenly the word disease makes so much sense.
[19:35:35] <mikesherov> on margin, padding, border
[19:35:40] <DaveMethvin> there is no i in team
[19:35:45] <mikesherov> so I also added a set hook for those to save bytes
[19:36:14] <mikesherov> I suppose we can apply setPositiveNumber to a large list
[19:36:16] <mikesherov> I SUPPOSE
[19:36:18] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: And the reason he wanted expand is because of class animaitons in UI :-P
[19:36:24] <mikesherov> and you know what, I named that stupidly
[19:36:32] <mikesherov> it should be setNonNegativeNumber
[19:36:38] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: gzip don't care
[19:36:54] <mikesherov> Yeah, and neither does minify
[19:37:02] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's one or two chars
[19:37:03] <scott_gonzalez> Gotta go. Getting kicked out of Panera.
[19:37:07] <mikesherov> k
[19:37:29] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez, we could do that, wouldn't be hard to add
[19:37:51] <DaveMethvin> if you look at that list on ui-8157 i just don't see a lot that would be important to limit
[19:38:16] <DaveMethvin> the only realistic way it matters is if you try to do an undershooting animation on them
[19:38:24] <DaveMethvin> and oldIE barfs
[19:38:38] <DaveMethvin> so we can just stall people until oldIE is gone :D
[19:39:14] <DaveMethvin> so mikesherov the pull queue is down to almost nothing

[19:41:31] <mikesherov> what do all those clocks mean?
[19:41:42] <DaveMethvin> waiting to run the test
[19:41:51] <DaveMethvin> i dunno why they can't just spin up some more instances
[19:41:51] <mikesherov> and when did browserstack get so slow?
[19:42:05] <DaveMethvin> i am not sure why it's slow
[19:42:43] <mikesherov> I started a test today, and I got someone elses webpage
[19:42:54] <mikesherov> something is borked at browserstack
[19:43:11] <DaveMethvin> which is a shame b/c it is mighty handy
[19:43:18] <DaveMethvin> my local vms are getting wonky
[19:43:21] <mikesherov> yeah

[19:58:32] <DaveMethvin> what the hell were those css guys thinking?
[19:58:53] <mikesherov> Well, it's currently as big as this PR will be
[19:59:17] <mikesherov> I can cut it a lot, I believe
[19:59:35] <mikesherov> just up to you whether it's worth pursuing the edginess of this case
[20:00:21] <DaveMethvin> how big is it now?
[20:00:30] <DaveMethvin> probably 20-30 bytes?
[20:00:42] <mikesherov> eyeballing it, looks like around 50
[20:01:12] <DaveMethvin> my original objection was based on the incorrect assumption this was a shortcut prop
[20:01:13] <DaveMethvin> but it's not
[20:01:24] <DaveMethvin> it's just a screwy one
[20:02:14] <DaveMethvin> if it was 50 bytes that seems awfully big for a case like this
[20:02:33] <mikesherov> agreed
[20:02:33] <DaveMethvin> it can be done as an external hook
[20:03:02] <mikesherov> I'm fine with that too. We can tell that guy that. I just don't want to leave him hanging.
[20:03:33] <DaveMethvin> let's do that, he can add a hook for himself
[20:03:53] <DaveMethvin> i'll make a note on the pull request and close it
[20:06:18] <mikesherov> wait one sec actually, he's only positively checking for 0% 0%
[20:06:25] <mikesherov> he's doing extra work really
[20:06:33] <mikesherov> this could probably be way smaller
[20:06:41] <mikesherov> but yeah, let's close it
[20:06:45] <mikesherov> never mind
[20:07:33] <mikesherov> https://github.com/rewish/jquery/commit/436dbbb5552660472082001a5cfeb48b3d82bb1f#L0R57 gaurantees it's only the 0% 0% case he's fixing
[20:07:34] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by rewish (1m, 18h ago): Fix only supports IE9, also supported CSS3
[20:07:49] <mikesherov> this could be like 20-30 bytes
[20:08:25] <DaveMethvin> so does that mean you want to give it a try mikesherov?
[20:08:31] <mikesherov> yeah
[20:08:53] <mikesherov> If 20-30 bytes is acceptable for the edge-casiness of it
[20:09:03] <DaveMethvin> worst case, if it's big and ugly people can use a gist of it
[20:09:09] <mikesherov> got it
[20:09:17] <DaveMethvin> ok thanks
[20:09:32] <mikesherov> Just put a note on the PR that we'll try to help get this be small enough, but no promises
[20:09:33] <DaveMethvin> i'll leave it open then, if you want to post a note on it ga
[20:09:40] <mikesherov> and I'll hold his hand the rest of the way
[20:10:03] <mikesherov> OK, will do. Gnight
[20:10:11] <mikesherov> thanks as always!
[20:10:18] <DaveMethvin> gnite!
[20:24:31] <gibson042> DaveMethvin thanks for the kind commit message :)
[20:24:45] <DaveMethvin> haha yeah
[20:24:55] <DaveMethvin> gotta keep the commit messages fun to read
[20:25:32] <DaveMethvin> gzip gave you a few extra bytes too ... i think you're paying that guy
[20:27:14] <gibson042> our style guide helps a surprisingly large amount
[20:27:27] <gibson042> it's very gzip friendly
[20:27:38] <gibson042> and my satanic bargain didn't hurt either
[20:27:50] <DaveMethvin> well what can you do with a soul anyway
[20:29:56] <gibson042> a heck of a lot less than what I can do with all those saved bytes
[20:30:57] <DaveMethvin> alright, that's it for me, i'm going to bed
[20:31:06] <DaveMethvin> thanks, see you later
[20:31:11] <gibson042> yep
[20:31:13] <gibson042> goodnight
[22:56:14] <Eshu> HI guys
