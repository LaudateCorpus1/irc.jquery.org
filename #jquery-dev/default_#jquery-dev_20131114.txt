[03:32:08] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Pull request #1415 by brynary (1w 6d ago): Add Code Climate badge
[05:35:57] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: +1 i think something like that badge can only lead to more "jQuery is so bloated and bad and here is more proof" not even understanding what the numbers actually mean and that its not nessasarilly bad that it has a low score for some things
[05:46:14] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: yup
[06:56:53] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: you around? I finished the release script last night, but I suspect you may hit some bumps. Let me know if you do.
[06:57:08] <DaveMethvin> here timmywil
[06:57:22] <DaveMethvin> do you want to post a pr for it?
[06:57:39] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: oh, um, it's already committed :)
[06:57:45] <DaveMethvin> oh np
[06:57:50] <DaveMethvin> any particular concerns?
[06:58:12] <timmywil> it's just doing a lot. You may have questions.
[06:58:18] <DaveMethvin> i usually break something every time i do a release, so join the club
[06:58:27] <DaveMethvin> really hard to test without actually releasing :)
[06:58:42] <DaveMethvin> i'll take a look in a while
[06:58:55] <timmywil> yea, I ran a bunch of tests to my own repo and a trash npm project, but I obviously didn't test the real thing
[06:59:30] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: you'll need to do npm adduser and sign in as jquery
[06:59:55] <DaveMethvin> ok
[07:00:03] <timmywil> you have the pw?
[07:00:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[07:00:11] <timmywil> cool

[07:14:09] <DaveMethvin> will that affect the changes you made to the release script timmywil?
[07:14:54] <timmywil> it shouldn't affect a lot, just the sizzle location, which is set at the top
[07:15:07] <DaveMethvin> ok
[07:15:11] <timmywil> actually, I could land that and make the change

[09:35:52] <scott_gonzalez> jquery-git is broken: http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/QFp2J/
[10:21:05] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez indeed, i see what it is too
[10:21:45] <scott_gonzalez> Can't let this stuff sneak into the beta :-)
[10:22:05] <DaveMethvin> right, i meant to save that for the final ;)
[10:22:12] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[10:23:00] <DaveMethvin> it's the focusin patch ... did i mention i hate focusin
[10:24:11] <scott_gonzalez> oh boy
[10:24:35] <scott_gonzalez> I just fixed some focus-related tests in IE8 by using $( "body" ).focus() at the beginning of the tests :-/
[10:25:04] <DaveMethvin> wow and you didn't even need to wrap that in a setTimeout? :)
[10:25:15] <scott_gonzalez> No timeouts, which surprised me.
[10:25:40] <scott_gonzalez> I don't understand why this worked.
[10:25:50] <scott_gonzalez> The inputs weren't gaining focus.
[10:25:50] <arschmitz> did you know in ios its impossible to set focus on page load
[10:25:58] <scott_gonzalez> And documetn.activeElement was the HTML element.
[10:26:16] <scott_gonzalez> So I don't see how moving focus from there to the body would change whether the input gets focus with input.focus().
[10:26:24] <scott_gonzalez> But at least it's green now :-P
[10:26:28] <DaveMethvin> you can do it in IE if you don't mind throwing an error arschmitz
[10:26:30] <DaveMethvin> :)
[10:26:38] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't matter if it really works. It just matters if we're getting yelled at by bots...
[10:29:17] <gibson042> scott_gonzalez: us too: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/7f0b28e3083ab8e755801823166e1b008d128242/test/unit/event.js#L3
[10:30:22] <scott_gonzalez> At least we're consistent across projects :-P
[10:30:56] <DaveMethvin> i think the reason is that a window (the body) has to have focus before any sub-window (an element) can get focus
[10:31:34] <DaveMethvin> but of course you can't try to set focus before document ready, oh no

[11:39:27] <DaveMethvin> awesome, thanks timmywil
[11:41:45] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: np
[11:41:54] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: are you still planning on releasing today?
[11:42:11] <DaveMethvin> definitely
[11:42:16] <DaveMethvin> i have a few things to fix
[11:42:37] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez found out we broke UI so now i have to fix it until he isn't looking again
[11:43:05] <scott_gonzalez> The day of a release is the only time to look :-P
[11:43:38] <timmywil> which branch?
[11:43:41] <timmywil> both?
[11:43:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah both, i know what broke and should be able to fix it
[11:43:57] <timmywil> cool
[11:44:00] <arschmitz> yeah breaks mobile too
[11:44:08] <DaveMethvin> 2 for 1!
[11:44:11] <timmywil> arschmitz: you break mobile
[11:44:21] <arschmitz> normally thats true
[11:44:29] <timmywil> ;)
[11:44:33] <DaveMethvin> you guys don't use focus do you? 
[11:44:42] <DaveMethvin> you shoudl stop using focus :)
[11:44:46] <scott_gonzalez> I file the worst tickets :-/
[11:44:47] <arschmitz> lol
[11:44:53] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry DaveMethvin.
[11:45:03] <scott_gonzalez> Seemed like such a simple fix too.
[11:45:18] <scott_gonzalez> Gotta go move my car, brb.
[11:45:30] <DaveMethvin> really it was my fault, i made a bunch of mistakes
[11:45:40] <DaveMethvin> didn't have enough tests
[11:49:44] <DaveMethvin> timmywil are you getting lint errors when you build master?
[11:49:53] <DaveMethvin> seems like it's linting qunit and getting mad
[11:50:15] <timmywil> i wasn't. checking...
[11:50:29] <timmywil> clear for me
[11:50:44] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[11:50:47] <timmywil> maybe run npm i && npm prune
[11:50:57] <DaveMethvin> yeah lemme try that
[11:52:00] <DaveMethvin> it's definitely linting qunit, which doesn't follow our rules
[11:52:04] <DaveMethvin> so let me see why that is
[11:55:52] <DaveMethvin> so it's linting tests
[11:56:07] <DaveMethvin> and inside test/ is qunit/* which it is linting
[11:59:09] <DaveMethvin> so timmywil is it trying to lint all of qunit for you too? If not, what's different about your setup?
[11:59:40] <timmywil> hmm
[11:59:52] <timmywil> do git clean -dfx && npm i
[12:00:02] <timmywil> that qunit shouldn't be there
[12:00:21] <DaveMethvin> ah yes
[12:00:29] <DaveMethvin> prob because i've been branch-hopping
[12:01:12] <timmywil> ah
[12:01:58] <DaveMethvin> nope timmywil, it does get cleaned but npm install puts it back
[12:02:42] <timmywil> that...isn't....possible...head..hurts
[12:02:54] <DaveMethvin> okay, i just rm -rf'ed it
[12:03:02] <DaveMethvin> that worked
[12:03:02] <DaveMethvin> not sure why
[12:03:20] <DaveMethvin> strange because git clean was saying it was removed
[12:03:45] <timmywil> yea, I'm at a loss
[12:03:45] <DaveMethvin> alls well that ends with rm -rf
[12:03:59] <timmywil> rm -rf /usr yay!
[12:04:08] <DaveMethvin> now .. what was i doing before this? :D
[12:04:22] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: focus
[12:04:38] <DaveMethvin> double entendre!

[16:40:52] <Krinkle> 404 The requested URL /jquery/qunit-composite/node_modules/qunitjs/addons/close-enough/close-enough.html was not found on this server.
[16:41:04] <Krinkle> It wasn't the grunt-contrib-qunit tilde dependency
[16:41:06] <Krinkle> it was qunit
[16:41:33] <Krinkle> this plugin was assuming core bundled addon-close-enough and addon-canvas, not because it usees them but as a cheat to easily compose multiple test suites

[17:28:50] <Krinkle> can you set up irc hooks to match jquery/qunit?
