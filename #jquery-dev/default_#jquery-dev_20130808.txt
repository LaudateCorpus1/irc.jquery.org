[01:41:27] <Cork> is there a possibility i could request op for #jquery?
[02:05:54] <Cork> just in case, reason i ask: have been there several times with spammers and no op to handle it
[02:06:03] <Cork> (like right now)

[15:17:40] <ralphholzmann> hey ya'll
[15:17:50] <ralphholzmann> $.fn.toggle can take a boolean
[15:17:57] <ralphholzmann> but $.fn.slideToggle can not
[15:18:18] <ralphholzmann> would a PR that enables this be welcomed?
[15:20:39] <DaveMethvin> ralphholzmann slideToggle already takes two args, neither being boolean
[15:21:03] <ralphholzmann> DaveMethvin: this is true
[15:21:11] <ralphholzmann> so are you saying three args is one too many?
[15:21:48] <DaveMethvin> we've grown out of parameter hockey ... this is doable with a plugin and slideToggle is just a shortcut anyway
[15:21:56] <ralphholzmann> ah yes
[15:22:05] <ralphholzmann> the old "doable with a plugin"
[15:22:08] <ralphholzmann> thanks DaveMethvin
[15:22:42] <DaveMethvin> you can use "show"/"hide" with animate conditioned by your boolean if you call .animate directly
