[05:01:48] <Zerhackos> hi all, is there a specific reason why only the first data-role="page" is loaded on click of an anchor? (page = all.find( ":jqmData(role='page'), :jqmData(role='dialog')" ).first();)

[15:35:49] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/967 jQuery core full run on latest browsers
[15:36:21] <Krinkle> Opera 15 is the only one I ran manually for now (it won't be in the next regularly triggered run) since it isn't supported by browserstack's api yet.
[15:36:28] <Krinkle> ajax tests are fully fixed
[15:36:45] <Krinkle> looks like we've accumulated a few other test failures though that should be fixed in core.
