[05:33:26] <m_gol> snover: Isaac Schlueter's stance is that CommonJS is dead
[05:33:52] <scott_gonzalez> `tell snover I'm here now ;-)
[05:33:52] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: I‚Äôll tell snover about that.
[05:34:47] <m_gol> `tell snover Isaac Schlueter's stance is that CommonJS is dead
[05:34:47] <b-ot> m_gol: I‚Äôll tell snover about that.
[05:36:25] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like ry had the same stance back in the last decade :-P
[05:37:24] <m_gol> ;)
[05:38:38] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/5132#issuecomment-15432598
[05:39:09] <scott_gonzalez> "Ryan basically always gave zero fucks about CommonJS anyway." That's exactly how I remember it too.
[05:39:34] <scott_gonzalez> Though Ryan also thinks JavaScript is a pretty terrible language.
[05:39:58] <scott_gonzalez> Which I've always found amusing.
[05:50:38] <m_gol> lol
[05:50:50] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: why did he choose it then?
[05:51:07] <scott_gonzalez> He said there wasn't a better language to use.
[06:07:59] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: Specifically, I believe it was the fact that JavaScript was built for evented systems.
[06:23:37] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: ah, yeah, I remember one video with him describing his motivations where he said that
[06:24:12] <m_gol> though I have an impression he said more about how JS didn't have any complex built-in logic for async code so that it's not polluted by bad solutions or sth
[06:24:15] <m_gol> I wonder what he does these days... he disappeared completely from the internet
[06:25:14] <scott_gonzalez> He actually thinks switching from promises to node-style callbacks was a mistake.
[06:25:29] <scott_gonzalez> He's said that he wishes he didn't make that change.
[06:25:41] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, no idea, he's disappeared.
[06:25:53] <scott_gonzalez> He did say that after node, he wanted to create a new language.
[06:25:59] <scott_gonzalez> But I don't think that's what he's doing.
[08:56:39] <snover> m_gol: ‚ÄúIsaac Schlueter's stance is that CommonJS is dead‚Äù what does this mean? i‚Äôm not sure i understand
[08:58:47] <scott_gonzalez> snover: Give me a few minutes and I can find a link for you.
[08:59:06] <snover> are you referring to the commonjs organisation, the module format known as commonjs, something else?
[08:59:28] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/5132#issuecomment-15432598
[09:03:13] <snover> ‚Äú(And client-side modules ‚Ä¶ aren't our problem.)‚Äù is the attitude that has kept us from having an interoperable module format for years
[09:04:10] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that's node's stance, not npm's stance.
[09:04:19] <snover> also the idea that just because a particular use case isn‚Äôt valuable for a lot of people, that it‚Äôs OK to just refuse to have it
[09:04:19] <scott_gonzalez> Even though it's coming from Isaac.
[09:05:55] <snover> anyway. i just want the long nightmare to be over
[09:07:19] <scott_gonzalez> Don't we all.
[09:12:13] <snover> it requires people to compromise and think through solutions that aren‚Äôt just relevant to their one little slice of the world and not say things like, well, client-side doesn‚Äôt matter to us
[09:35:38] <ajpiano> http://blog.npmjs.org/post/101775448305/npm-and-front-end-packaging 
[09:46:25] <snover> yeah, i read that when it was published, but as far as i‚Äôve seen nothing has changed yet on that front
[09:46:35] <snover> i hear tell npm 3 will fix some stuff
[09:47:01] <snover> it would be nice if they waited to fix the things before advertising that their package manager is ‚Äúthe package manager for browsers‚Äù‚Ä¶
[09:47:34] <arthurvr> sure. (but I don‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs a better solution than npm so‚Ä¶)
[09:49:33] <snover> it‚Äôs like microsoft and ie. when they said they were committed to better standards and started releasing ie8, ie9, i think everyone was still very much in a ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù mode. now it‚Äôs pretty clear that the ie team does have open standards in mind, but they had to do a significant amount of work to undo the ‚Äúwho gives a fuck about standards, attachEvent forever!‚Äù culture
[09:49:46] <snover> stigma
[09:50:21] <snover> given the past attitude and general arrogance of some of the key players, i am still in the ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù mode on this one
[09:51:35] <snover> well, and, the dishonesty. you can‚Äôt proclaim on your front page that you‚Äôre the package manager for browsers whilst also posting blog posts about how you know that you‚Äôre not actually good enough to be used for front-end dev
[09:54:23] <snover> honestly proclaim*

[12:09:15] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Before you talk about irony of web sites, you might consider the fact that the world's most popular JavaScript library has a blog that looks like shit on mobile devices.

[13:11:35] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: Oh that sucks. But at least we don't browser sniff. So why is it looking too small? Seems fine when i resize the window on my desktop
[13:11:46] <DaveMethvin> so the media queries are working
[13:29:40] <snover> the viewport tag isn‚Äôt quite right
[13:36:07] <agcolom> DaveMethvin: scott_gonzalez: seems to me that setting overflow: scroll to code blocks would help
[13:38:29] <agcolom> DaveMethvin: if you rezize your window, it looks ok, but you may have missed that you get a horizontal scrollbar on your window, because the code block remains too wide.
[13:40:04] <scott_gonzalez> That's one problem.
[13:40:11] <scott_gonzalez> The other is the images and videos.
[13:40:56] <agcolom> yes, I was wondering whether they were getting their size because if the window width which remains too wide because of the code block
[13:41:33] <agcolom> for them, taking height and width out solves it once you've set overflow: scroll;
[13:42:40] <agcolom> we get the same issue on the api docs when we have long function names...
