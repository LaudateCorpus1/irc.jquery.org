[05:11:38] <aaronmcadam> http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596806767
[05:21:47] <aaronmcadam> is there a reference somewhere of chainable methods? Is it safe to rely on if the method returns jQuery?
[05:22:04] <aaronmcadam> was gonna write some xslt/xpath to gimme a list of them
[05:22:07] <erichynds> anything on $.fn is chainable
[05:22:15] <erichynds> unless used as a getter of course
[05:22:51] <aaronmcadam> ah right
[05:23:35] <aaronmcadam> just sometimes I'm not sure when to use .end() or not
[06:53:20] <jetienne> q. has qunit been used with node.js ? is it compatible with it i mean
