[23:54:53] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer Krinkle leobalte1 et al: FYI, I finally got around to updating all of my QUnit assertion plugins to add support for QUnit 2.x (and maintain support for QUnit 1.x)
[23:55:44] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer Krinkle leobalte1 et al: Also, qunit-composite has now undergone a breaking change to support QUnit 2.x, thanks to a PR from Kevin (platinumazure) that I finally got around to merging
[23:56:36] <JamesMGreene> I still need to get around to the JUnit Reporter but unfortunately I've already over-used what little free time I had this weekend to update all of the above
[23:57:09] <JamesMGreene> (The JUnit Reporter should still work in QUnit 2.x AFAIK but it just needs some love and PR review/merging in general)
[23:57:32] <JamesMGreene> Hope all is well out there, jQuery devs <3
[23:57:34] <JamesMGreene> Peace out
