[12:07:08] <mikesherov> The remaining Jenkins failures are the IE6 effects bug which I have open PR for.
[12:07:40] <mikesherov> And the Qunit raises bug that gibson042 fixed.
[14:02:35] <DaveMethvin> .
[17:32:32] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: you here?
[17:33:27] <mikesherov> bot-t: tell scott_gonzalez to check out http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8158 and let me know if you can still repro. I believe it's fixed.
[17:33:28] <bot-t> mikesherov, Okay.
[17:39:01] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: we should be able to get testswarm green again pretty simply now that jenkins is fixed
[18:14:06] <DaveMethvin> .
[18:14:51] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: i was gonna tackle the backlog in the pull requests ... any specific order you'd suggest for yours?
[18:15:16] <mikesherov> yeah, the IE6 failures first, then the modularization
[18:15:32] <mikesherov> gibson's fix requires an updating of QUnit

[18:32:42] <jaubourg> \o/
[18:33:03] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: how come you're only here when it's 3:30am here :P
[18:33:14] <jaubourg> lotsa heres
[18:33:15] <DaveMethvin> lol
[18:33:27] <DaveMethvin> i don't want to keep you up too late now
[18:33:34] <jaubourg> haha
[18:33:39] <jaubourg> too late, so to speak
[18:34:18] <DaveMethvin> well i will be here in about 11 hours if you are
[18:34:28] <jaubourg> I should be
[18:34:34] <jaubourg> meeting tomorrow, right?
[18:34:38] <DaveMethvin> right
[18:34:48] <jaubourg> hopefully able to attend for once
[18:34:51] <DaveMethvin> i gotta get an agenda ready
[18:35:01] <DaveMethvin> have you seen the modularization stuff
[18:35:04] <DaveMethvin> ?
[18:35:06] <jaubourg> yep
[18:35:17] <DaveMethvin> think you might be able to get ajax modularized?
[18:35:18] <jaubourg> still need to review the dependency management code mike did
[18:35:23] <jaubourg> probably
[18:35:30] <jaubourg> timeframe?
[18:35:44] <DaveMethvin> next week or so?
[18:35:55] <DaveMethvin> i gotta get serious about the schedule
[18:36:02] <DaveMethvin> and we need an alpha release
[18:36:02] <jaubourg> seems doable... I fly to the US next saturday though
[18:36:15] <DaveMethvin> but at the moment we don't even have a reliable jquery-git
[18:36:18] <jaubourg> after that it's vegas, having fun and then SF
[18:36:35] <DaveMethvin> assuming you can get into the country, buddy :D
[18:36:47] <DaveMethvin> we have high standards around here
[18:37:11] <jaubourg> oh, so that's what the Kardassians are always bragging about!
[18:37:14] * jaubourg hides
[18:37:25] <DaveMethvin> "Oh we see from our records you are Mr. jQuery Ajax, go right ahead sir!"
[18:37:32] <jaubourg> lol
[18:37:48] <jaubourg> if it ever happens to me, I'll probably faint or something
[18:38:21] <jaubourg> though one of my gf's friends boyfriend (still following?) recognized me for my work on jQuery$
[18:38:31] <jaubourg> it was a bit crazy to say the least
[18:38:35] <DaveMethvin> nice
[18:38:49] <jaubourg> he was looking at me with fan-like eyes
[18:39:01] <DaveMethvin> did you give  him an autograph?
[18:39:04] <jaubourg> thank god he forgot all about that now
[18:39:27] <jaubourg> I'd slap him but I didn't want to screw things with my gf's friends
[18:39:32] <DaveMethvin> haha
[18:39:32] <jaubourg> like "WAKE UP" you know
[18:39:43] <jaubourg> über nice guy though
[18:39:52] <jaubourg> it just was some kind of awkward moment
[18:40:09] <DaveMethvin> hey it's just the cross you must bear
[18:40:57] <jaubourg> damn, it's a pretty sweet cross but I guess being a pretend tennis ball between js devs, js gurus and browser devs is more like it :P
[18:41:22] <jaubourg> you know the drill
[18:41:33] <DaveMethvin> yeah if i believed the bug tracker i'd think you were a total moron
[18:41:59] <DaveMethvin> i can hardly wait for the conf so we can read some more bugs
[18:42:01] <jaubourg> the bug tracker just doesn't like me very much
[18:42:15] <DaveMethvin> MAH JQUERIES IS BROKEN
[18:42:21] <jaubourg> I sometimes picture it as HAL from 2001
[18:42:29] <jaubourg> scary thought
[18:43:02] <DaveMethvin> well if I hear you say "my mind is going Dave" then i know it is too late
[18:43:10] <jaubourg> anyway, I could probably make builds with conditional transports... now that would own
[18:43:48] <DaveMethvin> give it some thought, we can start with simply letting people build -ajax
[18:44:12] <jaubourg> yeah, damn, I'd love to see the build without effects and ajax become the standard build
[18:44:23] <jaubourg> then see what people can come up with as alternatives to effects and ajax
[18:44:32] <jaubourg> these parts so need new API ideas
[18:45:24] <jaubourg> only hard ajax dep is in manip, amyrite?
[18:45:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah and we need to make script processing more explicit imo
[18:47:01] <jaubourg> bah, we probably need to get rid of it
[18:47:20] <DaveMethvin> i like the way you think ... unreasonably :D
[18:47:22] <DaveMethvin> just like me
[18:47:24] <jaubourg> if we remove old IE support in 2.0, this will become a non issue
[18:47:41] <jaubourg> since we won't have the security bug
[18:47:41] <DaveMethvin> it definitely simplifies things
[18:49:06] <jaubourg> OK, I'll look into this build without ajax... do I simply error if manip tries to use ajax if it's not built-in ?
[18:49:16] <jaubourg> seems the most reasonable approach
[18:49:54] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
[18:50:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah i thinkso
[18:50:30] <DaveMethvin> we need to generate error dialog boxes with short urls to a page saying "you EEEDIOT!"
[19:00:06] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: what's the grunt flag syntax to generate build without something specific
[19:00:10] <jaubourg> (testing ajax)
[19:00:23] <jaubourg> ?

[19:00:52] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (1d, 22h ago): fixes #11857, modularizes CSS
[19:01:02] <DaveMethvin> it has some examples
[19:01:11] <DaveMethvin> also rwaldron updated the readm
[19:01:12] <DaveMethvin> e
[19:01:32] <jaubourg> that will work in windows the &&?
[19:01:54] <DaveMethvin> worksforme
[19:02:34] <jaubourg> 25261 bytes min gzipped without ajax
[19:02:36] <jaubourg> :P
[19:03:08] <DaveMethvin> ZOWIE!
[19:03:12] <jaubourg> now to see which tests fail miserably because ajax is implicitly required
[19:03:27] <DaveMethvin> that's the hard part about all of these
[19:03:38] <DaveMethvin> just about ready to land mike's stuff

[19:05:54] <DaveMethvin> ut oh, test fails
[19:06:21] <jaubourg> omg, unit tests are so much faster without ajax involved :P
[19:06:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah, and cut off effects and it's like instant
[19:25:32] <jaubourg> damnit, why is fn.serialize in ajax, should be in its own module really
[19:27:41] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[19:28:19] <jaubourg> I'll do that later, really need some fixin
[19:28:37] <jaubourg> I'll just commit the build without ajax with fixed unit tests
[19:28:58] <jaubourg> since it's done
[19:29:13] <jaubourg> just have to check I didn't break anything for the full build
[19:29:40] <DaveMethvin> you can do a pr and we can check it over
[19:29:51] <jaubourg> damn, I have it in master :/
[19:29:57] <DaveMethvin> haha
[19:30:18] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: let me check the full build first
[19:30:24] <DaveMethvin> np
[19:30:24] <jaubourg> then I'll figure out how to handle this
[19:30:32] <jaubourg> but it's working flawlessly so far
[19:30:40] <DaveMethvin> or you could, like, GO TO SLEEP :D
[19:31:03] <jaubourg> in your dreams
[19:31:14] <jaubourg> "Never give up ! Never surrender !"
[19:31:30] <DaveMethvin> failure is not an option, it's the default
