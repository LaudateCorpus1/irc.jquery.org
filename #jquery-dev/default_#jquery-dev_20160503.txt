[12:57:54] <markelog> gibson042: @DaveMethvin: ping
[12:58:08] <gibson042> what's up?
[12:59:01] <markelog> i'm not sure i understand what is happening here - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3100#issuecomment-216579883
[12:59:55] <markelog> i guess i have missed you initial comment in some pull
[13:00:00] <markelog> where it was described
[13:00:15] <markelog> but does it mean that if you pass one nonthenables it will resolve in async way
[13:00:22] <markelog> but if two it will be sync?
[13:04:58] <markelog> gibson042: ping
[13:05:05] <gibson042> markelog: jQuery.when() and jQuery.when( v ) are always async
[13:06:14] <gibson042> and having said that, I'm motivated to make jQuery.when( v1, â€¦ ) always async as well
[13:06:30] <markelog> so it is the other way around?
[13:06:30] <gibson042> but right now it is not necessarily so
[13:06:50] <markelog> it seems it would resolve the inconsistency right?
[13:07:04] <markelog> and more adhere to spirit of spec and othere implementations right?
[13:07:15] <gibson042> well, it's only an inconsistency if you consider multi-argument to be the same call
[13:07:19] <gibson042> which it isn't
[13:07:26] <markelog> at the moment?
[13:08:04] <gibson042> ever
[13:08:17] <gibson042> jQuery.when has always been asked to do double duty
[13:08:35] <markelog> mm, i'm confuse
[13:08:41] <markelog> didn't you said
[13:08:42] <markelog> "I'm motivated to make jQuery.when( v1, â€¦ ) always async as well"
[13:09:03] <markelog> so at the current state it could be sync, but in the future it might be async?
[13:09:14] <markelog> it might always async?
[13:09:30] <gibson042> yes, we could choose to do that
[13:09:41] <gibson042> I don't know if we should
[13:09:47] <markelog> why not?
[13:10:09] <markelog> is there any concerns?
[13:11:02] <gibson042> I guess https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3100 are the concerns
[13:11:33] <markelog> i guess more troubling is the
[13:11:35] <markelog> "I get worse though. Console is ACDB, which is not acceptable; $.when(p) and $.when(p, p) should behave the exact same way."
[13:11:51] <markelog> so if we fix that, it seems it would be much better?
[13:14:33] <markelog> gibson042: ?
[13:15:49] <gibson042> that's the argument
[13:16:07] <gibson042> but it holds much less water if $.when(p) and $.when(p, p) are considered as separate calls
[13:16:35] <markelog> agreed
[13:16:48] <markelog> but i think most people would associate those two
[13:17:24] <gibson042> I think so too
[13:17:33] <markelog> you okay with me re-opening that ticket?
[13:18:10] <DaveMethvin> sorry i'm in a meeting but let's not rehash too much here
[13:18:35] <gibson042> so it's a question of which is more valuable: eagerness and backwards compatibility of jQuery.when(v1, â€¦), or consistency of always-async behavior of jQuery Deferred code (modulo .done)
[13:19:06] <markelog> it seems we already changing the behaviour in major way
[13:19:10] <gibson042> markelog: that ticket says jQuery.when should always be synchronous... it should not be reopened
[13:19:28] <markelog> okay, another ticket then
[13:19:30] <gibson042> but we may want a new one for "jQuery.when should always be asynchronous"
[13:19:51] <markelog> i can take this on and provide a pull for that
[13:20:05] <markelog> i know you very busy lately :)
[13:21:32] <gibson042> :)

[14:20:31] <markelog> timmywil: you there?
[14:27:55] <timmywil> YA
[14:35:25] <markelog> timmywil: do we enable "merge" button?
[14:35:32] <markelog> or there is only squash?
[14:36:39] <DaveMethvin> markelog: looks like only squash is enabled, but that's probably good
[14:36:42] <timmywil> yea, it's squash only, cause we don't like merge commits. But, I've still been merging them manually.
[14:37:05] <DaveMethvin> i only use the button for simple stuff like typos
[14:37:09] <markelog> DaveMethvin: timmywil: yeah, that is what i would suggest, just checking :)
[14:37:31] <markelog> do we have new member btw?
[14:37:50] <timmywil> oh right! I'll do that now. Too many meetings.
[14:38:58] <markelog> okay, cool
[14:39:02] <markelog> did he accept?
[14:55:35] <timmywil> I'll send out a welcome email when I get a response.
