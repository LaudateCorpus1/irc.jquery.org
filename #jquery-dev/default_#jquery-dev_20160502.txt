[12:01:32] <DaveMethvin> hey are we having a meeting?
[12:01:43] <DaveMethvin> i don't see timmywil
[12:01:49] <m_gol-> me neither
[12:01:53] <m_gol-> did he say anything?
[12:02:06] <DaveMethvin> i saw a comment on a ticket this morning
[12:02:21] <DaveMethvin> i prepopulated an agenda already, i have to leave early
[12:02:30] <DaveMethvin> we're getting close on a release
[12:02:32] <m_gol-> he replied on GitHub 43 minutes ago, maybe a random disconnection
[12:02:38] <m_gol-> Dave, could you open the channel then?
[12:02:41] <DaveMethvin> sure

[12:39:43] <m_gol> gibson042: sth went wrong with this commit: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2759
[12:40:08] <gibson042> O_O
[12:40:36] <m_gol> the error matrix seems pretty random...
[12:45:39] <gibson042> do we just retry? local runs work for me on both Chrome and Firefox
[12:46:07] <m_gol> yeah, I'd try to re-run everything
[12:46:25] <m_gol> normally I just restart the failed entry in the table if there is 1 or 2
[12:46:34] <m_gol> but there are lots of them here so it'd be good to verify
[12:46:34] <gibson042> same here
[12:46:46] <m_gol> I'm looking at IE9 now, it seems to go slow for some reason
[12:46:47] <gibson042> I'll let IE9 finish and then reset all
[12:46:52] <m_gol> ok

[12:49:50] <gibson042> still looks flaky :\
[12:50:31] <m_gol> I restarted the previous run as well to make sure it's not BrowserStack
[12:52:39] <gibson042> whack-a-mole fixed iOS 9.1
[12:59:07] <m_gol> the previous run now fails as well: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2748
[12:59:11] <m_gol> I'll write to BrowserStack
