[00:26:33] <lonejack> hello, I'm building a form using jquery ui widgets. Some fields (i.e. normal input text fields) are appearing in a different style respect to the widgets. To solve the problem I've applied a specific style to those fields(in order to have the same effect). Does it exist a more simple(and canonical) way to solve this question?

[02:26:00] <kentaromiura> Hi, as I said in the blog I'll suggest to avoid 'compat' because it will surely cause lot of confusion around what compat means (mostly because people don't read). In my experience 'compat' was the single most misunderstood piece of MooTools.

[06:36:03] <m_gol> we're failing on newer WebKit & Android in 1.x, hmm
[06:36:42] <m_gol> it hangs on "ajax: #13240 - jQuery.ajax() - support non-RFC2616 methods"
[06:38:30] <DaveMethvin> hmm
[06:38:42] <DaveMethvin> i think that was in there for old IE wasn't it?
[06:38:58] <m_gol> yeah, because we're handling it specially there
[06:39:05] <m_gol> I wonder what trips it
[06:39:18] <DaveMethvin> and it just started?
[06:39:39] <m_gol> it works locally, obviously :D
[06:39:57] <DaveMethvin> and a hang is pretty sucky
[06:39:57] <m_gol> just started for Safari 7, was this was in Android 4.3-4.4 from the beginning (i.e. a few weeks ago I guess)
[06:40:33] <DaveMethvin> wonder if it's some issue with the server doing something strange with a PATCH request
[06:42:17] <m_gol> actually
[06:42:24] <m_gol> it works for me in local Safari 8
[06:42:32] <m_gol> it doesn't work on BrowserStack in Safari 7 on Mavericks
[06:42:58] <DaveMethvin> do you get a hang?
[06:43:03] <m_gol> I get an error that might be hanging TestSwarm
[06:43:10] <DaveMethvin> ah

[06:45:56] <m_gol> what a descriptive error message
[06:47:28] <DaveMethvin> well it never expected to fail :)
[06:51:48] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: it works on local server + Safari 7 from a VM, doesn't when I switch to Safari 7 from BrowserStack
[06:51:53] <m_gol> so it's them
[06:52:04] <m_gol> which would explain why it fails on random browsers but consistently
[06:52:09] <DaveMethvin> a very strange specific thing to fail on
[06:54:36] <m_gol> k, sending an email
[06:59:14] <m_gol> they must be routing those requests manually or sth
[07:16:30] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: will next jQuery Migrate support IE8+ as well?
[07:16:45] <DaveMethvin> yeah i guess so
[07:17:04] <DaveMethvin> we could add some extra detect to see if it lacks IE8 features and warn about that too
[07:17:52] <DaveMethvin> of course, neither ie6 nor ie7 have `console` to warn about it :/
[07:19:15] <dcherman> they still support <blink> no?  just append a tag with a warning in those browers. done!
[07:19:33] <DaveMethvin> i like the cut of your jib dcherman :)
