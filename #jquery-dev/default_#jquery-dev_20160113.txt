[16:07:01] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: what's your plan for the beta release timing?
[16:07:08] <timmywil> tomorrow
[16:07:11] <DaveMethvin> k
[16:07:21] <timmywil> all blockers are in
[16:07:29] <DaveMethvin> yeah, great day today!
[16:07:40] <timmywil> but I'll wait for the dust to settle for a day on show/hide
[16:07:58] <timmywil> by the way, we did fix the perf issue presented by Paul
[16:08:09] <timmywil> don't know if you saw my jsperf
[16:08:12] <DaveMethvin> yeah between the show/hide and the selector thing
[16:08:17] <DaveMethvin> no didn't see the jsperf
[16:08:23] <timmywil> http://jsperf.com/old-vs-new-show-hide
[16:08:46] <timmywil> we're no longer retrieving computed display when hiding
[16:08:52] <timmywil> It was unnecessary anyway
[16:08:59] <DaveMethvin> WOW
[16:09:07] <DaveMethvin> that's worth crowing about
[16:09:11] <timmywil> yea!
[16:09:24] <DaveMethvin> i'm seeing an error at the end?
[16:09:41] <DaveMethvin> http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/320bb8.png
[16:09:41] <timmywil> yea, I just did a blanket copy/paste html from whitehouse.gov
[16:09:55] <DaveMethvin> oh maybe the html is mismatched or something
[16:10:09] <timmywil> yea, don't think it affects the test
[16:10:31] <DaveMethvin> well we made paul_irish happy i guess, "it was a good day"

[17:07:44] <m_gol> timmywil: that'd be called a jdalton repo
[17:08:13] <DaveMethvin> issue box zero
[17:43:41] <m_gol> hmm, we have a test that breaks in Chrome 30
[17:43:56] <m_gol> and it so happens that's what Android 4.4 WebView uses which is why we're testing it
[17:44:41] <m_gol> (at least the version BrowserStack shares: 4.4.2, which is not the latest one)
[17:47:35] <m_gol> btw, have you heard iOS 9.4 (yes, 9.4, not 10) will get a new WebKit?

[19:39:46] <m_gol> bug reports mean people are now actually trying 1.12.0/2.2.0, which is good!
[19:43:06] <DaveMethvin> yes, good to see that
[19:43:31] <DaveMethvin> seems like the bug reports are always for undocumented or non-standard behavior
[19:54:20] <snover> bug report: you fixed this bug i rely on
