[14:22:23] <snover> can someone tell me/link me to instructions on how to enable clabot?
[14:23:17] <DaveMethvin> hi snover ... i think the easiest solution will be to start a separate instance, i was looking at how to do that
[14:23:34] <snover> ok
[14:23:56] <DaveMethvin> the other approach would be to have the bot know about all the orgs and do it as one bot, but separate instances would prob be easier
[14:24:16] <DaveMethvin> let me find some references
[14:24:18] <snover> you think?
[14:24:44] <snover> since the source database is the same i would not imagine running a bunch of instances to be easier
[14:24:49] <snover> but i don‚Äôt know anything
[14:26:00] <DaveMethvin> snover: V
[14:26:05] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/360
[14:26:07] <DaveMethvin> there we go
[14:26:20] <snover> i need team access
[14:26:40] <DaveMethvin> ok 
[14:26:46] <snover> (404)
[14:27:54] <DaveMethvin> should work now ... we need to get the teams all cleaned up too
[14:28:03] <snover> yep
[14:28:46] <DaveMethvin> i just added you to the infrastructure team since that should get you into more places
[14:28:54] <snover> everything old is new again
[14:29:09] <DaveMethvin> every time i try to escape they suck me back in
[14:29:13] <snover> is there a way i can manually check a contributor for now?
[14:29:29] <DaveMethvin> of course, with another piece of access
[14:30:03] <snover> i am not sure offhand what changing the owner config stuff means
[14:30:30] <snover> i am sure it makes sense to someone that has seen the code :)
[14:33:04] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-license
[14:33:08] <snover> github is so confusing lately
[14:33:23] <snover> i went into teams and it was like ‚Äúhey teams are totally changed now please take many minutes to fix your teams‚Äù
[14:33:26] <DaveMethvin> they keep changing stuff ... both good and bad
[14:33:38] <snover> i just want to add a person, go away tutorial :(
[14:33:48] <snover> still waiting for issue templates‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
[14:33:53] <DaveMethvin> exactly
[14:34:15] <snover> for some reason i just got an email containing an entire commit message
[14:34:29] <snover> that i just pushed
[14:34:42] <snover> i never get emails like these so why this one?
[14:34:43] <DaveMethvin> that's a new one on me
[14:35:06] <snover> so weird, so broken
[14:35:54] <snover> did you guys get a copy of the DF database of CLAs?
[14:36:06] <snover> or does it not really matter since the agreements are not identical
[14:36:41] <DaveMethvin> we
[14:37:06] <DaveMethvin> we'll need to reconcile them eventually but getting the new prs and such vetted should be our first step
[14:39:13] <snover> ok
[16:15:15] <snover> DaveMethvin: seems like maybe 3loc change to make the webhook server work across multiple projects?
[16:15:45] <snover> bin/server.js line 21 change to [].concat(config.owner).forEach(function (owner) { notifier.on( owner + "/*/pull_request", prHook ); })
[16:15:49] <snover> 1loc change
[16:15:50] <snover> :D
[16:21:22] <snover> oh i guess there is some use of config.owner in Repo
[16:21:57] <snover> so i guess my 3loc thing still stands.
