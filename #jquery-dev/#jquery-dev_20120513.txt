[14:40:47] <bot-t> (34 hours 50 mins ago) <gnarf> tell mikesherov hey - do you want to take a stab at http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8627 ?
[14:41:03] <mikesherov> sindresorhus_: I better check to see if you're here either
[14:41:54] <mikesherov> gnarf: I'll take a stab at it
[14:42:51] <mikesherov> gnarf: I'll steal the ticket and reassign it to me
[14:42:54] <mikesherov> and put it in css

[14:43:28] <sindresorhus_> mikesherov: Hi
[14:43:52] <mikesherov> sindresorhus_: I opened a PR against your grunt branch of Modernizr, take a look
[14:44:15] <mikesherov> gnarf: do you agree with what I wrote in that ticket about a list of values for "normal"
[14:46:57] <gnarf> mikesherov: your approach sounded pretty sane
[14:47:20] <mikesherov> k, actually, it IS in effects, so I'll just change owner to me and take a stab
