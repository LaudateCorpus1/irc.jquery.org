[20:50:07] <gibson0421> saptaks: sorry about the colossal delays, but I re-reviewed https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/335 and your https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/335#issuecomment-251473038 comment is accurate. If you submit a PR, I'll land it quickly. Otherwise, it may be a little while for me.
