[06:40:13] <scott_gonzalez> Is anyone around that knows about Sizzle's speed tests?
[07:09:15] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: This jar file doesn't exist anymore: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/master/speed/data/checkJava.js#L17
[07:11:05] <timmywil> cool
[07:11:30] <scott_gonzalez> Does it need to be re-added or is the checkJava module no longer necessary?
[07:12:09] <timmywil> oh, I'll check
[07:13:16] <timmywil> It's ignored by bower, so we can leave it out.
[07:13:34] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so I should just drop the checkJava file?
[07:14:14] <timmywil> sure, and remove any references to it
[07:14:25] <scott_gonzalez> of course
[07:14:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'll put together a PR
[07:14:33] <timmywil> thanks
[07:16:12] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, this is the only reference to it: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/master/speed/speed.js#L8
[07:16:19] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't seem like it needs a PR.
[07:16:31] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just push to master.

[07:36:13] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin|away m_gol timmywil: Jenkins IRC notifications are back (see messages from doesallmagic2 above). All builds with failing TestSwarm tests are now marked as unstable (yellow). Anything red should get immediate attention, since then something outside of TestSwarm broke: http://jenkins.jquery.com/
[07:36:42] <jzaefferer> jQuery Core has currently just one failure on iOS 6: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/3153
[07:36:54] <timmywil> hooray!
[07:37:52] <jzaefferer> I'm trying to get TestSwarm report reruns properly, so that Jenkins waits for them: https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/217
[08:43:39] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I assume freenode.net and not freenode.org? I think the latter works but is deprecated, like irc.freenode.org -> irc.freenode.net -> chat.freenode.net
[08:43:55] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/255#issuecomment-45726085
[08:45:42] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: yeah, wrong tld in my comment, correct on in Jenkins
[08:45:57] <Krinkle> Looking into https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/217 now
[08:46:00] <Krinkle> ok
[08:46:11] <jzaefferer> I dug into that for a while
[08:46:30] <jzaefferer> Hopefully my digging notes are of some use
[08:54:01] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/217#issuecomment-45760663
[09:01:28] <Krinkle> updated comment..
[09:08:02] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: so if we update both node-testswarm and testswarm-browserstack after patching TestSwarm itself, it could work?
[09:10:18] <Krinkle> first testswarm-browserstack to account for reruns, then testswarm api to expose reruns per job, the node-testswarm to wait for it
[09:14:29] <jqcommit> [13qunit] 15jzaefferer opened issue #593: throws: Support callback to assert error 02http://git.io/IBcjDA
[09:19:25] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: Adding the property in the job status API sounds simple enough...
[09:21:48] <Krinkle> I mentioned it in that order since testswarm-browserstack already has access to pending reruns via the swarmstate API (testswarm-browserstack doesn't use the job status API, it provides the swarm as a whole)
[18:09:43] <antlong_> would anyone be interested in helping out with an open source sci-fi / rpg? just started making it, www.multiverseminer.com - we're using jquery ui, and we'd really like people who are good with it, to help us grow with it. we also really need some help with the js front in general, and design.
[18:28:00] <leobalter> antlong_: we don't use this channel for general topics, this is for development of jQuery only.
[18:28:10] <antlong_> ok, thanks
