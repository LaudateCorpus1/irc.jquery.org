[09:05:23] <tj_vantoll> Hey all, if anyone is around I'm wondering if this is a bug: https://gist.github.com/tjvantoll/9be302543d7a83ab0e08
[09:06:12] <tj_vantoll> Specifically I'm wondering whether "jquery/ajax" should depend on "./event", because unless I specifically include it I get an error.
[09:37:32] <tj_vantoll> I created a ticket: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/15118

[11:03:04] <leobalter> Sorry to use this channel for this, but I gotta say this once: I LOVE YOU! <3 It's really perfect contributing with your code and having you sharing such great experience. 
[11:19:22] <tj_vantoll> I'm trying to run the Core unit tests and I'm getting this error: "Uncaught Error: Mismatched anonymous define() module: undefined".
[11:19:26] <tj_vantoll> Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?
[11:30:19] <leobalter> Just got it running from master branch
[12:50:55] <markelog> leobalter: we love you too :-)
[12:51:13] <leobalter> :)
[13:36:40] <tj_vantoll> Can anybody try to help me figure out why the unit tests won't run for me? I load jquery/test/index.html in a PHP-enabled server and I get a RequireJS error about an anonymous define() call. I'm having trouble tracking down what I'm doing wrong.
[13:41:23] <tj_vantoll> I get here (https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/3b9057a18de31b838bd0dd25ea466993b62f9dd9/test/unit/ready.js#L8) and I get an error because jQuery is undefined. I have no idea what the underlying cause is.
[19:48:02] <leobalter> tj_vantoll I even tried to test it in  fresh clone, no clue, tests are running. I've also tested calling http://127.0.0.1/jquery/test, http://127.0.0.1/jquery/test/ and http://127.0.0.1/jquery/test/index.html Tests are running ok
[19:49:26] <leobalter> ok, got it
[19:50:13] <leobalter> tj_vantoll: you should run `npm install` before and than `grunt` to build jquery dist files in order to have them loaded in your tests 
[19:50:51] <leobalter> verified this on a new clone without building 
[19:52:01] <leobalter> ... someone email him with this info? he's not online 
[19:58:18] <leobalter> Found it on his github, done
