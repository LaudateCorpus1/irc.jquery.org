[10:55:03] <markelog> gibson042: hey, you there?
[10:59:57] <gibson042> markelog: at reduced capacity, but yes
[11:00:45] <markelog> i wanted to close down https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2892 discussion, it seems we both understand opposite position, correct?
[11:00:57] <markelog> not close the ticket that is)
[11:01:44] <gibson042> are you sure that's the right ticket?
[11:03:24] <markelog> no, it is not, don't know why i'm confusing the tickets today
[11:03:43] <markelog> that one - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2863
[11:07:20] <gibson042> I think we're missing each other on this point: ".show()Â needs to guess when setting a non-empty inline display is both necessary and sufficient to give an element layout, but the distinction is significant."
[11:07:35] <gibson042> but otherwise understand the opposite position
[11:16:19] <markelog> i'm saying both code-paths should determine if element is hidden
[11:16:30] <markelog> and i think it should be the same
[11:16:52] <gibson042> do you understand what I mean when I say that show/hide should not determine if element is hidden?
[11:22:02] <markelog> i understand that for hide
[11:22:10] <markelog> show still needs do it?
[11:35:19] <markelog> gibson042:.
[11:38:09] <gibson042> I'm drawing a distinction between show determining hiddenness and show determining if it should and can force layout
[11:53:03] <markelog> gibson042: yeah, i think i get that, you see my point too, right?
[11:55:42] <jqcommit> [13qunit] 15trentmwillis opened issue #926: Run tests in random order 02https://git.io/vgk9y
[11:59:25] <gibson042> if you understand but reject the distinction, then I understand your position
[11:59:36] <gibson042> I left one more comment on the issue to clarify mine
[12:02:16] <jqcommit> [13jquery-migrate] 15dmethvin closed issue #84: $.sub doesn't work with jquery 1.11 02https://git.io/bctX
[12:04:37] <markelog> gibson042: yeah, cool
[12:04:53] <markelog> gibson042: what do you mean by
[12:04:55] <markelog> .toggle(), .fadeTo(), .animate(), etc. have different behavior...
[12:04:56] <markelog> ?
[12:05:12] <gibson042> I updated my comment
[12:05:24] <gibson042> the point is that their behavior depends on hiddenness
[12:06:14] <markelog> "change their behavior for hidden elements"
[12:06:25] <markelog> gibson042: you want them to change their behaviour, right?
[12:06:35] <gibson042> I'll update again
[12:06:37] <gibson042> hang on
[12:07:43] <gibson042> ok: "â€¦need to know when elements are hidden (because it affects their behavior), and should all use the same logic to determine that"
[12:07:59] <DaveMethvin> can we define the actual code scenarios where behavior will change? we should have that for the blog post as examples
[12:09:05] <markelog> gibson042: updated my comment accordingly 
[12:09:19] <markelog> DaveMethvin: we still yet deciding that
[12:09:59] <markelog> but yeah, i agree we need to show that somewhere
[12:10:23] <markelog> i believe i have proposed that for the previous blog post, but didn't have the time
[12:10:30] <markelog> i also think, we can document that
[12:10:43] <markelog> so in blog post, we could just link to the docs
[12:11:07] <markelog> *didn't have the time to write it up
[12:14:56] <gibson042> markelog: ".toggle() should assume disconnected elements to be hidden" and ".show().toggle()Â is always equivalent toÂ .hide()" are contradictory positions
[12:17:16] <markelog> if show() set a display, then not
[12:17:32] <markelog> since toggle should also check the inline
[12:18:11] <markelog> i'm talking about previous logic, not the current one
[12:20:41] <gibson042> it's contradictory no matter what
[12:21:45] <gibson042> well, unless .show() is a no-op
[12:21:54] <gibson042> but we have unit tests asserting that it isn't
[12:22:04] <markelog> show() set a display=something, toggle() checks the inline and calls hide(), hide() sets display=none
[12:22:22] <markelog> inline check first, then check for detached nodes
[12:22:41] <gibson042> and when .show() sets empty inline display?
[12:23:03] <markelog> when does it do that?
[12:23:13] <gibson042> it PREFERS to do that
[12:23:22] <gibson042> so that we don't screw up responsive layouts
[12:23:34] <markelog> currently yes, but as i have said, i'm talking about previous logic
[12:24:13] <gibson042> which was broken
[12:24:28] <markelog> for detached elems?
[12:24:34] <gibson042> for responsive layouts
[12:25:01] <markelog> that a different discussion, which i have a different opinon
[12:25:09] <markelog> but regarding detached elems
[12:25:23] <gibson042> regarding detached elements, both the old logic and the new logic are broken
[12:25:47] <markelog> you jumping to conclusion i think
[12:25:58] <gibson042> no, I posted JSFiddles
[12:26:10] <markelog> yeah, and i called it a bug
[12:26:24] <gibson042> so it's a "bug" but it's not "broken"?
[12:26:41] <markelog> no, i'm saying i'm agree with you on that part
[12:26:47] <markelog> but
[12:27:03] <markelog> i don't think that is justification for introducing the new logic
[12:27:14] <gibson042> I thought you said that was a separate discussion?
[12:27:17] <markelog> we could easily fix that with the old one
[12:27:34] <gibson042> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2863 is PURELY about detecting hiddenness
[12:27:36] <markelog> well, yeah, we jumping here
[12:27:44] <gibson042> NOT about whether such a check belongs in showHide
[12:28:15] <markelog> i'm trying to be on point and don't talk about stuff like responsive stylesheets
[12:28:25] <markelog> which is not relevant for the detached nodes
[12:29:07] <markelog> anyway, getting back to the ticket at hand, i believe we now understand each other
[12:29:27] <markelog> is that correct, right?
[12:29:59] <gibson042> yes, I believe we have one point of contention: whether or not toggle() et al. should assume disconnected elements with empty inline display to be hidden
[12:30:23] <gibson042> and that it is the only point of contention for #2863
[12:30:28] <gibson042> does that match your understanding?
[12:30:44] <markelog> yeah and i think that logic of the show()/toggle()/animate()/etc should be the same
[12:30:54] <markelog> so yeah
[12:30:56] <gibson042> that is not part of #2863, though
[12:31:22] <markelog> toggle() is part of the #2863, right?
[12:31:35] <gibson042> toggle() is; show() is not
[12:32:09] <markelog> but toggle() in my concept relates on it, depends even
[12:32:52] <gibson042> to put it another way, #2863 is about the body of `isHiddenWithinTree`, but not its invocation points
[12:34:53] <markelog> then you would change the logic for everyone, you could even use `isHiddenWithinTree` in show()
[12:36:08] <gibson042> that's a separate discussion, though... we also disagree on whether show() should use `isHiddenWithinTree`, but it's not part of this ticket
[12:36:40] <markelog> we disagree so much! )
[12:36:47] <gibson042> lol :D
[12:37:04] <markelog> i my gonna buy you a beer next time i see you)
[12:37:26] <gibson042> we'll buy each other drinks
[12:37:29] <gibson042> much fun will be had
[12:37:35] <markelog> )))
[12:37:55] <markelog> okay, so this how i see we moving forward on this 
[12:38:17] <markelog> i will propose a pr, the one, we talked about at the meeting
[12:38:53] <markelog> then DaveMethvin and timmy will decide  
[12:39:39] <markelog> then we can come back to that ticket
[12:39:47] <gibson042> are you planning to combine the two issues in your PR?
[12:41:21] <markelog> no, if we will choose to use a previous logic for show() then that inconsistency you showed, needs a separate discussion, if that is worth it and stuff
[12:41:47] <markelog> new hide() is here to stay in any case, so we (or more precise you) definitely improve that
[12:42:05] <gibson042> so your PR will leave `isHiddenWithinTree` unchanged, and just address its use?
[12:42:13] <markelog> yeah
[12:42:18] <gibson042> ok
[12:42:19] <gibson042> cool
[12:42:23] <markelog> ok-ok
