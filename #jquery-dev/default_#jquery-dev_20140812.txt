[13:29:18] <paul_irish> bros
[13:29:29] <robertmaxrees> cap'n
[13:29:42] <paul_irish> https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide#jquery
[13:29:56] <DaveMethvin> fellas
[13:29:59] <paul_irish> the copy/paste friendly snippet we have here is for 1.11.1
[13:30:05] <paul_irish> rather than 2.1.1
[13:30:12] <paul_irish> a number of folks would love to change that.
[13:30:17] <DaveMethvin> i think that's okay as is
[13:30:27] <DaveMethvin> the smart people will figure it out?
[13:30:40] <DaveMethvin> and the not-so-smart will copy/pasta and it will work
[13:31:06] <robertmaxrees> what about 2 bits for jquery?  or some kind of subheading for 2.x vs 1.x or somethin'?
[13:31:19] <paul_irish> very doable.
[13:31:31] <paul_irish> 1.x snippet: â€¦
[13:31:36] <paul_irish> 2.x snippet: â€¦
[13:31:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah that would be optimal i guess
[13:31:44] <robertmaxrees> and then the note: explains the diff?
[13:31:48] <paul_irish> no note
[13:32:00] <DaveMethvin> if they don't know the diff they can go looking imo
[13:32:09] <paul_irish> leave it to the jquery site to explain. the CDN shouldn't get into the business of explaining that
[13:32:14] <robertmaxrees> fair enough.
[13:32:37] <paul_irish> k
[13:32:38] <paul_irish> i like this
[13:32:47] <paul_irish> we'll do 1.x snippet first 
[13:32:47] <DaveMethvin> me too
[13:33:30] <DaveMethvin> in about a year let's hope ie8 is dead enough that we can forget this ever happened. :)
[13:33:53] <snover> i assume you saw the microsoft announcement about their browser support plan
[13:33:59] <robertmaxrees> i'll drink to that.
[13:34:04] <DaveMethvin> snover: yeah
[13:35:19] <paul_irish> here's my projected trendlines: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArK1Uipy0SbDdExaYVpOQUdSUDVEYXctWVB2QVFJQnc&usp=drivesdk#gid=2
[13:35:49] <paul_irish> seems as though ie8 will follow the green trend
[13:37:05] <DaveMethvin> at that point people will have lots of old jquery versions to use in case they still need ie8
[13:38:11] <paul_irish> snover: want a secondary dojo snippet or you good?
[13:38:35] <snover> paul_irish: a what now?
[13:38:51] <paul_irish> do you want convenient snippet for the 1.9 release?
[13:39:19] <snover> oh. no, thatâ€™s ok. thanks though!
[13:39:22] <paul_irish> :) kk
[13:39:43] <paul_irish> nice having such convenient access to everyone here. :)
[13:40:06] <snover> it could be that way all the time if DaveMethvin would stop going on vacation :)
[13:40:06] <DaveMethvin> next week we'll have unlimited breadsticks too
[13:41:10] <DaveMethvin> well that and my irc client doesn't seem to revive propery when my laptop wakes sometimes
