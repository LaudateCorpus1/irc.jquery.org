[12:28:55] <WebDragon> I dunno if anyone else has noticed this, but http://jquery.com/download/ has not been updated to reflect the current jquery-migrate version as https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/releases is up to 1.4.1 -- the downloads page still shows 1.3.0 
[12:29:05] <WebDragon> I was lucky to have just worked with the https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery-migrate which shows its version as 1.4.1, which is why I remembered it
[12:29:44] <DaveMethvin> WebDragon: thanks for the note! it should have been updated, I'll do it now
[12:30:16] <DaveMethvin> feel free to file an issue on https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/issues if you see something like that in the future
[12:30:21] <WebDragon> glad to have helped :)
[12:30:51] <WebDragon> yeah it is technically an issue but it's such an easy fix (tweaking the website) that I thought I'd pop over here first :)
[12:32:17] <WebDragon> I just wish https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery showed the latest release of EACH tier -- 1.12.4, 2.2.4, and 3.0.0-rc1
[12:32:52] <DaveMethvin> that's up to them, if they have a contact just let them know
[12:33:34] <WebDragon> it's doubtful that will change due to how it works, but I will consider it -- that was just an idle wish :)
[12:34:03] <DaveMethvin> kind of surprised they don't do all versions tbh
[12:34:03] <WebDragon> anyway, keep up da great work folks. couldn't do what I do as easily without ya
[12:34:22] * WebDragon tips proverbial hat, and leaves a carafe of DragonCoffeeâ„¢ on the counter
[12:34:54] <WebDragon> you can find 'em by typing in the version num at the end of the url, for each one, but it's tedious
[12:35:17] <WebDragon> anyways, I'm off . cheers!

[12:57:36] <doesallmagic2> Dave Methvin: Build: Recognize and update beta versions in the README file
[13:32:42] <arschmitz> timmywil: DaveMethvin: we recently got a lot of breakage against git in mobile
[13:32:51] <arschmitz> seems event related a lot fo things being undefined
[13:32:58] <arschmitz> $.event.props.concat
[13:33:26] <arschmitz> .target.nodeType
[13:33:26] <timmywil> ah, $.event.props was removed
[13:33:31] <DaveMethvin> does it go away if you use Migrate?
[13:33:40] <timmywil> migrate puts it bak
[13:34:02] <timmywil> made those properties lazy
[13:34:17] <DaveMethvin> arschmitz: can you link to your code? most likely it should just be completely removed for 3.0 compat 
[13:35:24] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: i have not found the exact offending code yet it breaks about 3/4 of our tests though
[13:35:46] <DaveMethvin> if you include Migrate it will give you file and line
[13:43:09] <DaveMethvin> arschmitz: looks like Mobile is borrowing the $.event.props list so it can create its own events,  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/d04308f591d4d0e58443d6a645d0cc1f599888d2/js/vmouse.js#L68
[13:43:43] <arschmitz> yes
[13:43:55] <DaveMethvin> You could copy the list of events you want to copy from the 2.x source, like was done for touch above that: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/d04308f591d4d0e58443d6a645d0cc1f599888d2/js/vmouse.js#L28
[13:44:38] <DaveMethvin> Migrate won't help there, the use case we support is people adding new names to the props list but not looking at the existing list
[13:45:09] <arschmitz> so then this is going to break all existing version of mobile and migrate wont help
[13:45:22] <arschmitz> so if you release as is it will not be possible to use any version of mobile with 3.0
[13:45:25] <DaveMethvin> the current migrate won't fix it, no
[13:45:33] <DaveMethvin> we'd need to change that
[13:45:33] <arschmitz> regardless of migrate
[13:46:21] <DaveMethvin> so it looks like Mobile needs that list to be there unchanged throughout the code execution
[13:46:57] <DaveMethvin> we'd need to figure out a way to diff the list each time an event executed to see if anything was added
[13:47:04] <DaveMethvin> since it's not a static list
[13:47:18] <DaveMethvin> or we'd need to only support a static list 
[13:47:27] <DaveMethvin> and give up on letting people add stuff
[13:48:46] <DaveMethvin> is that the only place where it's breaking?
[13:49:05] <DaveMethvin> or are there other breaks too?
[13:49:36] <arschmitz> there are other breakages 
[13:50:08] <arschmitz> a lot of places we are just getting all the tests timing out so i need to find the cause of that
[13:50:33] <DaveMethvin> let's fix this one first and see what's left
[13:50:51] <arschmitz> i suspect this is the cause of a lot of it
[13:50:56] <arschmitz> https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/jobs/128619301
[13:51:10] <arschmitz> vmouse is a core component of mobile where that is breaking
[13:52:05] <DaveMethvin> this line shouldn't be needed at all in 3.0 https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/d04308f591d4d0e58443d6a645d0cc1f599888d2/js/vmouse.js#L30
[13:52:23] <DaveMethvin> so just check if $.event.props exists before executing it
[13:52:39] <arschmitz> ok
[13:54:29] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/d04308f591d4d0e58443d6a645d0cc1f599888d2/js/vmouse.js#L68
[13:54:53] <DaveMethvin> replace with the 2.2 code: props = ( "altKey bubbles cancelable ctrlKey currentTarget detail eventPhase " +
[13:54:53] <DaveMethvin> 		"metaKey relatedTarget shiftKey target timeStamp view which" ).split( " " ),
[14:00:34] <DaveMethvin> I think all this code is not needed in 3.0, the $.Event constructor copies things as needed: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/d04308f591d4d0e58443d6a645d0cc1f599888d2/js/vmouse.js#L68-90
[14:01:06] <DaveMethvin> so the only part that would stay is the part that copies changedTouches[0] properties directly to the event
[14:04:03] <arschmitz> ok
[14:05:22] <DaveMethvin> i have to run off but i can help you with it later ... do the Mobile unit tests run pretty well locally if I give it a try here?
[14:07:38] <arschmitz> yes just make sure your on the branch 1.5-dev
