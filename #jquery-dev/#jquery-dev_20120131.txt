[07:33:02] <sindresorhus> jzaefferer:  Is the Treeview plugin an official jQuery plugin? http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Treeview
[07:33:29] <jzaefferer> sindresorhus: nope, its not
[07:33:59] <sindresorhus> jzaefferer: Maybe move the docs from docs.jquery.com to the GitHub repo?
[07:34:42] <jzaefferer> eventually, yeah
[07:34:59] <jzaefferer> wanna help with that?
[07:36:01] <sindresorhus> Yeah, sure
[07:36:12] <sindresorhus> Should I just submit a pull?
[07:58:46] <sindresorhus> jzaefferer:  Is the plugin actively maintained anymore?
[07:59:56] <jzaefferer> Well, if someone submits a pull request that is reasonable, I'll land it
[08:00:01] <jzaefferer> beyond that, not so much
[08:00:10] <jzaefferer> there's plenty good tree plugins
[08:01:27] <sindresorhus> jzaefferer:  k, should we maybe recommend one?
[08:02:02] <jzaefferer> jstree?
[08:02:39] <sindresorhus> jzaefferer: Sure, if I don't stumble on anything better
[08:27:52] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: WTF is going on with Trac?
[08:28:08] <scott_gonzalez> The influx of spam is insane.
[10:31:40] <scott_gonzalez> Oh no... Come back, MySQL. I have comments for ticket!!!
[10:42:14] <paul_irish> bot-t1: tell mikesherov one more for your document-the-feature-forks plan https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/524#issuecomment-2241183
[10:42:14] <bot-t1> paul_irish, Okay.
[10:42:14] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by rwldrn (4m, 3d ago): Migrate from document.defaultView => window. Fixes #10373
[12:18:29] <ben_alman> rwaldron: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11265
[12:20:10] <rwaldron> triaged
[12:35:24] <timmywil> .
[12:35:27] <DaveMethvin> ..
[12:35:32] <timmywil> ................
[12:35:38] <DaveMethvin> ok you win
[12:35:43] <timmywil> heh
[12:35:56] <DaveMethvin> so we need some sort of server side code for unit tests
[12:36:02] <DaveMethvin> like for ajax etc
[12:36:15] <timmywil> true fact
[12:36:26] <ben_alman> but you only need that code for the ajax module, right?
[12:36:38] <timmywil> ideally
[12:36:41] <ben_alman> right
[12:36:48] <DaveMethvin> if we want to give up the stuff that mikesherov just added,  yes
[12:37:03] <DaveMethvin> like the ability to choose whether to use combined files or an old version
[12:37:03] <ben_alman> what's the value add of his stuff?
[12:37:16] <timmywil> one place to edit the script list
[12:37:21] <DaveMethvin> right
[12:37:29] <ben_alman> how often does that list change?
[12:37:31] <timmywil> but it can be done on the front-end
[12:38:00] <timmywil> we COULD load scripts with javascript to accomplish the same thing
[12:38:14] <DaveMethvin> yes, but we still couldnt do ajax testing
[12:38:22] <timmywil> which is expected
[12:38:35] <ben_alman> sure
[12:38:47] <DaveMethvin> so it's really just a q of which set of crippled features we want where
[12:39:00] <DaveMethvin> nobody has wanted anything beyond php or local before
[12:39:06] <DaveMethvin> or file:// before
[12:39:16] <timmywil> where's the cripple?
[12:39:18] <ben_alman> part of the point of the way qunit has been designed was to allow a subset of tasks to be run for a large project like jquery, presumably to allow individual modules to be worked on
[12:39:20] <DaveMethvin> no ajax
[12:39:33] <timmywil> that has been there since the beginning
[12:39:49] <rwaldron> I honestly think we should just say: run the test suite on a localhost server that supports php. or dont at all.
[12:39:54] <ben_alman> maybe just say "in order to run unit tests you MUST be serving files through a webserver that has php enabled"
[12:39:56] <rwaldron> ...for now...
[12:40:11] <ben_alman> and then maybe point people to a one-liner that can do that
[12:40:14] <DaveMethvin> let's check the readme
[12:40:32] <timmywil> it just seems unnecessary. running from a python server (or even from file:) shouldn't be a problem for non-ajax testing
[12:40:33] <rwaldron> says nothing
[12:40:40] <ben_alman> i searched README.md for "php" and found nothing
[12:40:54] <rwaldron> timmywil fine, then do that
[12:41:00] <rwaldron> but we need to pick ONE WAY
[12:41:39] <rwaldron> the whole "this doesnt work when I'm reading nabokov on tuesday" thing is obnoxious
[12:41:43] <timmywil> OK, I guess the easiest thing is to just document it
[12:41:48] <DaveMethvin> for now i think so
[12:41:55] <rwaldron> and trying to handle every case is also obnoxious
[12:42:29] <ben_alman> btw i'm tyring to run jquery's qunit tests from 1.7.1 tag headless and i pretty much don't get past the first test
[12:42:38] <DaveMethvin> well i think we have the most common things working, either you can run file:// or a server with php
[12:42:40] <timmywil> I can stick it in
[12:42:41] <ben_alman> fails on the teardown "No unit tests leak memory in jQuery.cache" :/
[12:42:47] <ben_alman> timmywil: just the tip
[12:43:41] <DaveMethvin> as long as you can run file:// on everything but ajax i think we are okay
[12:43:45] <rwaldron> I'mm going to address this now.
[12:43:48] <rwaldron> nt later
[12:43:58] <DaveMethvin> i thought timmywil just said he was editing it
[12:43:59] <timmywil> rwaldron: I'm editing readme now
[12:44:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah what he said
[12:44:07] <rwaldron> I'm not talking about the readme
[12:44:07] <ben_alman> fwiw, zombie.js doesn't work with file:// urls but i know nobody (not even me) cares about that
[12:44:14] <timmywil> oh ok
[12:44:30] <timmywil> I'm confused then
[12:44:45] <DaveMethvin> i think hes gonna beat up ben_alman
[12:44:52] <timmywil> cool
[12:45:03] <DaveMethvin> that'll teach him to open tickets
[12:45:27] <timmywil> CLOSED resolution: BEAT UP BEN ALMAN
[12:45:36] <ben_alman> are the jquery unit tests doing document.write anywhere?
[12:46:33] <gibson042> the non-PHP fallback in include_js.php
[12:46:49] <DaveMethvin> for file:// yes
[12:48:14] <DaveMethvin> i'm sure mikesherov agonized over some bizarre commenting trick that would have made the strings appear only once
[12:48:16] <DaveMethvin> :P
[12:49:18] <scott_gonzalez> Why do we need PHP? for timeouts?
[12:49:20] <gibson042> I see what you did there
[12:49:30] <DaveMethvin> ajax
[12:49:35] <ben_alman> scott_gonzalez all the ajaxes
[12:49:38] <DaveMethvin> echoing back headers etc
[12:49:50] <gibson042> also for non-200 HTTP responses
[12:50:18] <rwaldron> ugh this is soooo annoying
[12:50:26] <rwaldron> there is no "nice" way to clean this up
[12:50:47] <timmywil> How's this: "Run the unit tests with a local server that supports PHP. No database is required."
[12:50:56] <timmywil> Easy enough?
[12:51:05] <DaveMethvin> i think that;s fine
[12:51:05] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good. We have the same requirement for UI tests.
[12:51:05] <ben_alman> timmywil: maybe a little bit of instrux on that
[12:51:17] <DaveMethvin> longer term we could do it with some other server, for example node.js if we wanted, it just seemed easy to use php
[12:51:30] <ben_alman> it's not as easy to spin up a php-enabled server as a static python / node/ ruby server
[12:51:38] <timmywil> Yea, we'd want to port all of the ajax tests to node first
[12:51:43] <ben_alman> which are all trivial
[12:51:58] <ben_alman> (and static, of course)
[12:52:10] <timmywil> ben_alman: I could just recommend w/m/lamp
[12:52:13] <timmywil> ?
[12:52:15] <scott_gonzalez> Porting to node sounds fine. Though it would likely add a step for most devs.
[12:52:17] <ben_alman> timmywil: sure
[12:52:23] <timmywil> kk
[12:52:33] <DaveMethvin> we already have a dep on node
[12:52:52] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, you could  have the  file open itself and read the list of files out of the javascript code to avoid the duplicate list
[12:52:59] <ben_alman> DaveMethvin: i'm going to be helping rwaldron figure some of that stuff out, but not today :P
[12:53:00] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, we have a dep on node, but *nobody* will be running the node test server.
[12:53:16] <DaveMethvin> true dat scott_gonzalez
[12:53:17] <scott_gonzalez> You'll always have to start it up before you run the tests.
[12:53:40] <DaveMethvin> and ppl are very likely to have php around
[12:53:55] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, and their server is likely already running.
[12:54:48] <gibson042> am I the only one here who uses a one-liner "serve from this directory" web server for testing?
[12:55:08] <scott_gonzalez> gibson042: For the majority of your testing? Probably.
[12:55:16] <ben_alman> gibson042: https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/serve
[12:55:20] <ben_alman> simply python one
[12:55:39] <gibson042> I've been using http://code.google.com/p/mongoose/
[12:57:51] <gibson042> precisely for PHP support, in fact
[12:57:56] <ben_alman> yeah i wanted something that was just a few lines of code
[12:57:57] <ben_alman> gotcha
[12:58:15] <gibson042> mongoose -I /path/to/php-cgi -r `pwd` :)
[12:58:47] <ben_alman> smart
[12:59:23] <ben_alman> timmywil: might be nice to recommend that one
[12:59:46] <ben_alman> i don't really write CGIs much anymore
[13:00:06] <ben_alman> but that's very cool
[13:00:59] <timmywil> kk

[15:19:09] <jaubourg> hello there
[15:27:41] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Do you know why there's such a huge influx of trac spam?
[15:29:34] <scott_gonzalez> And I'm not referring to my delayed special events comments :-P
[15:30:46] <jaubourg> scott_gonzalez: my guess is we hit a new high on some web traffic metric?
[15:30:58] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[15:31:08] <scott_gonzalez> Seems odd that it coincides perfectly with the move to new servers.
[15:31:41] <jaubourg> well, if you think about it: more traffic = more power needed = change of server, amyrite?
[15:32:01] <jaubourg> so it seems like a likely coincidence
[16:44:12] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron jaubourg you guys good for a beta tonight?
[16:45:08] <DaveMethvin> wow, good thing i wrote all these steps down, it's been a while

[16:47:04] <DaveMethvin> ugh, ie7 isn't looking good
[16:47:09] <DaveMethvin> lemme try it locally
[16:48:36] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ya sure
[16:48:50] <rwaldron> as long as people know that they need PHP to run the test suite
[16:48:56] * rwaldron nods
[16:49:13] <DaveMethvin> haha, people run the test suite ... rwaldron that is precious :P
[16:49:34] <rwaldron> :D

[16:53:48] <rwaldron> :(
[16:56:01] <DaveMethvin> am i imagining things or does IE7 take a lot longer on unit tests?
[16:56:16] <DaveMethvin> like longer than it used to?
[16:56:46] <DaveMethvin> oh well, this is a beta so i guess I'll go ahead, we need to get these unit test issues ironed out but they are strange
[16:57:12] <rwaldron> it does
[16:57:15] <rwaldron> takes forever
[16:57:23] <DaveMethvin> did we add tests or something?
[16:57:31] <rwaldron> i dont know
[16:57:45] <rwaldron> i think that its felt like forever to me for a long time
[16:57:49] <DaveMethvin> I can't remember when i noticed it, seems like it was recent
[16:57:53] <rwaldron> ack, i have to go
