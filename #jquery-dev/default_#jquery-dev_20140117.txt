[09:49:03] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15thorn0 opened pull request #1487: Build: if --amd is specified, the define call isn't removed for exports/amd (06master...06patch-1) 02http://git.io/iWEcNQ
[09:53:55] <dcherman> out of curiosity, how often is the pre/git build updated?  just want to run my test suite against it again since #14701 was fixed, but it doesn't look like it has deployed yet
[10:09:08] <m_gol> dcherman: should be on each successful build... right, gnarf?
[10:44:47] <dcherman> m_gol: looks like the last build that ran was 2 days ago
[10:57:16] <m_gol> dcherman: gnarf, another part of jenkins problems? ;)
[10:57:42] <m_gol> we had some problems with jenkins recently and maybe this one didn't catch on
[11:18:15] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: Have you seen http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14702
[11:18:39] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: Oops, sorry. This is npm. I've reported this to  http://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues
[11:18:48] <m_gol> from the last comment
[11:18:49] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, but npm isnt' going to be able to fix it.
[11:19:00] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure who's around that has access to publish to jquery.
[11:19:09] <scott_gonzalez> We need to unpublish and republish.
[11:19:21] <m_gol> ah
[11:19:23] <m_gol> ok
[11:19:26] <m_gol> I don't have the keys
[11:19:38] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, didn't think so, but thought I'd ask ;-)
[11:19:39] <m_gol> and it seems there is only one maintainer called "jquery"
[11:19:58] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I talked to DaveMethvin|away and markelog about that yesterday.
[11:20:08] <scott_gonzalez> We're going to stop doing that and use people's individual accounts.
[11:20:21] <scott_gonzalez> With the shared owner, I can't tell who actually has access.
[11:20:35] <m_gol> true
[11:20:43] <m_gol> 1.11.0-rc1 is broken as well
[11:20:49] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[11:21:46] <m_gol> who can add versions at http://bugs.jquery.com/?
[11:21:50] <m_gol> we're missing some betas & rc
[11:21:55] <m_gol> * rcs
[11:23:17] <m_gol> I assume no one actually tried to do `npm install jquery` after publishing ;)
[11:23:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'm guessing no.
[11:24:34] <m_gol> https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/4506
[11:24:41] <m_gol> seems like people are waiting for that
[11:24:58] <m_gol> rwaldron timmywil: any one of you around?
[11:37:06] <gnarf> m_gol: ?
[11:38:34] <gnarf> dcherman: the git builds hiccuped over the last 2 days --- i accidentally allowed codeorigin.jquery.com to become a CDN and it almost took everything down with it :)
[11:39:08] <gnarf> dcherman: also, Krinkle|detached upgraded jenkins, and there were some problems that came from that
[11:39:19] <gnarf> I'm forcing a manual build right now of -git2 and -git
[11:41:15] <gnarf> dcherman: but yes, the sha on -git should be the same from 1.x-master and -git2 on master
[11:41:34] <gnarf> dcherman: within minutes of a push
[11:45:35] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Core build #1055: STILL FAILING in 7 min 41 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core/1055/
[12:01:50] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Core 1.x build #355: STILL FAILING in 16 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core%201.x/355/
[12:04:57] <m_gol> gnarf: it still runs an obsolete commit :/
[12:05:05] <m_gol> the same one, over & over again
[12:05:11] <m_gol> http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jquery
[12:06:45] <gnarf> okay
[12:06:45] <gnarf> so
[12:06:58] <gnarf> nothing should have changed regarding that
[12:07:29] <gnarf> if jenkins is broken, something else got messed up - maybe Krinkle didn't get it ironed back out
[12:07:33] <gnarf> jzaefferer yt?
[12:08:08] <gnarf> the only change I made in jenkins / swarm the last 2 days was to switch from using "jq01" to "codeorigin" for the scp url
[12:16:20] <gnarf> i'm not really sure how it does a git pull / updates
[12:19:54] <gnarf> or why it would be out of date
[12:24:58] <gnarf> I think all the "git" settings in jenkins might of gotten lost
[12:25:08] <gnarf> but I'm not sure of how it "should" be configured
[12:28:56] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Core build #1056: STILL FAILING in 0.24 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core/1056/
[12:29:37] <gnarf> apparently not like that
[12:30:51] <gnarf> m_gol: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/233 if you can see it
[12:31:01] <m_gol> yeah, got the notification, thanks
[13:14:01] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ping
[13:17:31] <DaveMethvin> sup m_gol 
[13:17:43] <dcherman> gnarf: ok, that's cool - just want to make sure i run my test suite(s) against pre at some point again, unless there's definitely gonna be another RC
[13:17:43] <DaveMethvin> just reassembling my system after blowing it away
[13:17:43] <m_gol> our both npm packages can't be installed
[13:17:47] <m_gol> probably some npm bug
[13:17:52] <m_gol> but we need to re-publish
[13:18:05] <m_gol> both 2.1.0-rc1 & 1.11.0-rc1
[13:18:18] <m_gol> do you have the keys?
[13:18:18] <DaveMethvin> hmmm i should be able to republish from the cdn copy
[13:18:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[13:18:29] <olavk> I have a question regarding contributing to the jquery documentation. Is this the apropriate forum?
[13:18:35] <m_gol> what CDN copy?
[13:18:48] <DaveMethvin> olavk, #jquery please
[13:19:00] <m_gol> isn't checking out the tag & publishing what needs to be done?
[13:19:01] <DaveMethvin> m_gol, just our normal code.jquery.com copyt
[13:19:02] <olavk> thanks
[13:19:23] <DaveMethvin> that should get me the same file, yes
[13:20:17] <m_gol> but we don't just publish built files to npm
[13:20:25] <m_gol> but also the whole src & some other stuff
[13:20:51] <m_gol> I assume that's not sth that's on code.jquery.com ;)
[13:21:29] <DaveMethvin> so let me look at npm
[13:21:41] <DaveMethvin> exactly what didn't get published?
[13:21:54] <m_gol> it did get published but we have weird npm-related errors
[13:22:04] <m_gol> see http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14702
[13:22:15] <m_gol> I'd try re-publishing and see if it helps
[13:22:27] <m_gol> npm unpublish && npm publish
[13:22:50] <m_gol> the trace is from node 0.8 but I have the same issue on 0.10 so that's not it
[13:22:58] <DaveMethvin> i can give it a try ... haven't used my node/npm/git setup on this system yet tho
[13:23:47] <m_gol> I can try it if you have incomplete setup
[13:24:21] <m_gol> to the benelovent jquery npm user :D
[13:25:07] <m_gol> * benevolent
[13:27:39] <DaveMethvin> i have to reboot, be back in a sec
[13:28:00] <m_gol> ok
[13:30:37] <DaveMethvin> yay
[13:55:12] <gnarf> dcherman: i wouldn't say definitely, but usually if there are any bugs in the RC we want to RC again
[13:55:41] <m_gol> 2.1.0-rc1 & 1.11.0-rc1 re-published on npm
[13:55:43] <m_gol> releasing is hard :)
[13:55:46] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: olavk: #jquery-content actually
[13:55:58] <gnarf> cc ajpiano 
[13:56:24] <DaveMethvin> well it depends on the question
[13:56:39] <gnarf> "regarding contributing" makes me think -content :)
[13:56:59] <DaveMethvin> oh, CONTRIBUTING
[13:57:03] <DaveMethvin> didn't notice that sorry
[13:57:15] <DaveMethvin> i was in the middle of the npm crisis and not reading well
[13:57:36] <gnarf> like everything anyone said to me the last two days? :)
[13:57:53] <DaveMethvin> another day of hard labor and my computer will almost be good as new
[13:58:10] <gnarf> olavk: DaveMethvin sent you to a pack of wolves in #jquery - find your way to #jquery-content to ask your contributing related questions, also check out http://contribute.jquery.com/documentation
[13:58:25] <DaveMethvin> haha olavk  come back!
[13:58:33] <olavk> Thanks - I want to improve documentation on higher order functions
[13:58:34] <DaveMethvin> i didn't mean it, sorry
[13:59:01] <DaveMethvin> so yeah #jquery-content would be best, depends on who's there at the moment
[13:59:09] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg would be ideal
[13:59:16] <DaveMethvin> but that's just how i feel about him
[13:59:17] <DaveMethvin> :O
[13:59:21] <DaveMethvin> :)
[14:01:09] <gnarf> olavk: use #jquery-content - ping/talk with kswedberg for core api, agcolom for mobile, scott_gonzalez? for UI and/or ajpiano for any of the above ;)
[14:01:28] <gnarf> also, start out on that contribute page, and I can probably answer any questions you have after reading that
[14:31:06] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: can you update milestones on Trac?
[14:31:19] <m_gol> * versions, not milestones
[14:31:34] <m_gol> we're missing beta3 & rc1 for both branches
[14:33:17] <m_gol> craaap
[14:33:22] <m_gol> https://npmjs.org/package/jquery
[14:33:35] <m_gol> 2.1.0-rc1 is published but 1.11.0-rc1 is installed by default
[14:33:37] <m_gol> wtf? :/
[14:34:25] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: do you know anything about it? should we set the "latest" field somehow?
[14:38:09] <m_gol> I republished 2.1.0-rc1 once more & now the field is correct
[14:38:26] <m_gol> we do have a problem, though, if the latest field is just set to whatever we do last
[14:41:24] <m_gol> bc then we have to remember to always publish 1.x first
[14:42:00] <m_gol> https://npmjs.org/package/jquery shows obsolete data for me now
[14:42:11] <m_gol> and complains about lacking README although it's present
[14:44:49] <DaveMethvin> m_gol, talking it over with scott_gonzalez right now
[14:45:29] <DaveMethvin> looks like we need `--tags beta` he's gonna try
[14:47:20] <m_gol> well, that's a separate thing
[14:47:28] <DaveMethvin>  `--tag beta`
[14:47:39] <m_gol> we decided to not mark it as beta so that users get that instead of the obsolete patched 1.8
[14:47:59] <m_gol> but how should we proceed when publishing 2.1.0 & 1.11.0 final?
[14:48:05] <m_gol> neither of them is a beta
[14:50:31] <scott_gonzalez> Well, they won't get 1.8 anyway, they'll get 2.1.0-beta3.
[14:50:35] <scott_gonzalez> Since that wasn't tagged as a beta.
[14:50:49] <DaveMethvin> right unless they say jquery@beta
[14:50:58] <scott_gonzalez> When we get to 2.1.0 and 1.11.0 we won't tag either.
[14:51:31] <m_gol> yeah, but beta should be latest unstable which currently is 2.1.0-rc1
[14:51:59] <m_gol> (we have a little mess right now since beta is 1.10.0-beta3 & latest is 2.1.0-rc1)
[14:52:20] <m_gol> and the problem I experienced now is the automatic latest tagging
[14:53:41] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: This is what we have right now:
[14:53:41] <scott_gonzalez> 'dist-tags': { beta: '2.1.0-rc1', latest: '2.1.0-beta3' },
[14:53:55] <scott_gonzalez> We can make 2.1.0-rc1 both beta and latest for now if we want.
[14:54:01] <scott_gonzalez> To avoid people getting beta3.
[14:54:15] <m_gol> yeah, that would be better
[14:54:49] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, updated.
[14:55:39] <m_gol> thx
[14:55:51] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[14:56:07] <m_gol> I see the maintainers list is more sane now ;)
[14:56:11] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[14:56:17] <m_gol> just this one nasty jquery user...
[14:56:40] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we'll get that removed once we add the rest of the people who were using that account.
[14:56:46] <m_gol> sure
[16:22:34] <gnarf> hrm

[19:07:40] <DaveMethvin> looks like we should bring back quickIs, or something like it http://jsperf.com/jquery-selector-set-trigger/4
