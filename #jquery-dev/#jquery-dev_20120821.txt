[01:47:02] <jaubourg> hello there
[05:55:49] <mikesherov> I hate .css("width")
[05:56:09] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: I can use some guidance here if you have a few moments
[05:57:17] <mikesherov> Or perhaps gnarf?
[05:57:52] <mikesherov> anyway, I'll leave this here for anyone to peruse:
[05:57:55] <mikesherov> it's a secret to everyone
[05:58:25] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12243 is a new bug report, but it's the opposite of this: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11293
[05:59:19] <mikesherov> essentially, .css("width") is too smart for its own good
[06:00:34] <mikesherov> if an element is not visible, the cssHook for width will swap in some properties to make it visible
[06:01:27] <mikesherov> but only sometimes is that valid
[06:02:33] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/u9lnSA

[06:23:03] <doesallmagic> dave.methvin: Fix #12350: jQuery.trim should remove BOM
[06:38:08] <jaubourg> FIX IT!
[06:38:10] <jaubourg> ahem
[06:38:12] <jaubourg> hi
[06:57:34] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin, kswedberg: how's life guys?
[06:57:58] <kswedberg> hi jaubourg! life's good. and for you?
[06:57:58] <DaveMethvin> oh, just fixin bugs
[06:59:20] <jaubourg> not bad, incredible sun in belgium... it's probably gonna snow frogs at one point or another given how extra-ordinary it is :)
[07:23:23] <kswedberg> haha
[09:11:58] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: jaubourg https://twitter.com/leckie/status/237945030663340032
[09:12:52] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: somehow i am not surprised /cc mikesherov
[09:13:10] <ajpiano> between this and the crazy moz bug
[09:13:23] <ajpiano> i would be semi inclined to say if you're the CEO of the company, let someone else file the bug reports
[09:13:39] <DaveMethvin> the CTO ajpiano! CTO!
[09:13:42] <jaubourg> CTO
[09:13:46] <ajpiano> oh right
[09:13:48] <ajpiano> my b
[09:13:56] <DaveMethvin> he knowz teh tech-nologee
[09:13:59] <jaubourg> yeah, and putting your CTO in the report, then accusing people of having a problem with their ego
[09:14:01] <jaubourg> so classy
[09:14:20] <DaveMethvin> i'll be happy to tweet to their customers asking for help if he's too busy
[09:14:36] <ajpiano> lol well judging by the RT's i'm getting, everyone agrees that he is way off base
[09:14:37] <ajpiano> :D
[09:14:38] <jaubourg> I'm just speechless... refraining from answering this bug report for fear of unleashing the f-word at every sentence
[09:15:02] <ajpiano> probably wise :p
[09:15:04] <jaubourg> and the disdain for open-source too
[09:15:16] <jaubourg> open source === no quality
[09:15:29] <jaubourg> yeah, right, you're using open-source tech but let's spit at it
[09:15:46] <ajpiano> eh, it's a typical megalomaniac move
[09:15:48] * jaubourg is very very angry at this guy
[09:16:02] <ajpiano> "you don't care about [your thing] unless you put [my thing] at the top of your list of priorities"
[09:16:10] <DaveMethvin> "Wish I could send you a test case, but as CTO I have determiend that Kentico source is too precious for your eyes"
[09:17:02] <DaveMethvin> "you might steal our proprietary method of fucking up events in Safari"
[09:17:13] <jaubourg> looool
[09:18:35] <jaubourg> http://devnet.kentico.com/Blogs/Martin-Hejtmanek.aspx
[09:28:09] <dialman> LOL, nice
[09:28:33] <ajpiano> oh DaveMethvin
[09:28:50] <DaveMethvin> wat?
[09:28:50] <b-ot> is it possible to write server in json?
[09:28:56] <ajpiano> dialman here is looking to start contributing, but is having some trouble getting things to build with grunt in windows
[09:29:11] <dialman> Indeed.
[09:29:15] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: no suprise there!
[09:29:19] <dialman> :)
[09:29:21] <DaveMethvin> so what's happening dialman?
[09:29:58] <jaubourg> it's because he's on dial
[09:30:00] * jaubourg hides
[09:30:16] <jaubourg> oh and hi dialman, welcome to the nut house
[09:30:52] <dialman> Well, I got jquery and it's dependancies, npm installed, npm installed grunt
[09:31:42] <dialman> And now I run grunt.cmd and it works through the various tasks, successfully finishing  through "Running "dist:*" (dist) task"
[09:31:50] <dialman> But then it fails on the next step:
[09:32:01] <dialman> Running "compare_size:files" (compare_size) task
[09:32:01] <dialman> >> CreateProcessW: The system cannot find the file specified.
[09:32:40] <DaveMethvin> sounds like it's missing that task
[09:32:45] <dialman> INdeed :)
[09:32:48] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:32:52] <DaveMethvin> sorry for stating the obvious
[09:33:17] <tbranyen> DaveMethvin: love that kentico dude
[09:33:23] <ajpiano> i got jquery up on windows last night nad npm installed
[09:33:28] <ajpiano> and i end up with a slightly different error
[09:33:29] <dialman> I've got compare-size.js in ~\node_modules\grunt-compare-size\tasks
[09:33:34] <tbranyen> last company i worked at was entirely kentico and hated that pos cms
[09:33:34] <ajpiano> but it might actually be the same error
[09:33:55] <DaveMethvin> what does your path look like?
[09:34:03] <DaveMethvin> i'll compare it to mine
[09:34:17] <DaveMethvin> oh, and are you using cygwin?
[09:34:17] <ajpiano> http://gyazo.com/b91a0dd9e9f98334768d3db23cdcfa80.png?1345565952
[09:34:31] <ajpiano> i was just using git bash, donno what dialman is using
[09:34:38] <dialman> Not using cygwin currently, but I do have it.
[09:34:54] <dialman> ajpiano: I was just using cmd
[09:34:57] <DaveMethvin> i'm using cyg, so that's a difference
[09:35:12] <DaveMethvin> i've had problems both ways
[09:35:13] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:35:16] <dialman> Ah, OK, maybe I'll try that path instead.
[09:35:39] <dialman> Also have ubuntu on another partition if that will be less of a PITA I can do that
[09:35:53] <DaveMethvin> well we do have some bumps to smooth out here
[09:36:03] <DaveMethvin> also the unit tests work better on apache atm
[09:36:31] <DaveMethvin> it can be made to work on ngnix but there's some fiddling you have to do
[09:36:48] <jaubourg> I'm on windows proper and have no issue
[09:37:00] <DaveMethvin> "windows proper" ==> oxymoron
[09:37:06] <jaubourg> :P
[09:37:16] <jaubourg> anyway, I gotta fly
[09:37:22] <jaubourg>  /kiss everyone
[09:38:14] <DaveMethvin> bye jaubourg
[09:38:22] <dialman> Anyhow, I'll take another stab later tonight with cygwin-- I am working at my "real" job right now :)
[09:38:27] <DaveMethvin> dialman: i just checked and can build without cyg as well
[09:38:31] <DaveMethvin> here is my path
[09:38:34] <DaveMethvin> PATH=C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows;C:\Windows\System32\Wbem;C:\Windows\System32
[09:38:34] <DaveMethvin> \WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;C:\cygwin\bin;c:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin;C:\Program
[09:38:34] <DaveMethvin>  Files\Microsoft Windows Performance Toolkit\;C:\Users\dave\AppData\Roaming\npm;
[09:38:34] <DaveMethvin> C:\Program Files (x86)\nodejs\;C:\Program Files\TortoiseGit\bin
[09:39:37] <DaveMethvin> dialman: let us know what you find out or drop in tonight and we'll try to straighten it out
[10:07:18] <danzik171> DaveMethvin: dialman: fwiw, that error is fixed in grunt 4.x according to https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/issues/155
[10:07:25] <danzik171> ( the build error )
[10:09:25] <dialman> Hm, I am on 0.3.12
[10:10:21] <DaveMethvin> i'm on 0.3.9 and the current grunt.js file works for me
[10:10:30] <DaveMethvin> both on cmd and on cygwin
[10:10:49] <DaveMethvin> so i'm not sure when that error comes into play
[10:11:15] <danzik171> it happens with you try to run git branch --no-color in the compare-size task
[10:24:32] <DaveMethvin> danzik171: sounds like it may not have the PATH set to find git, I've also found I needed HOME set to make node.js happy
[10:24:56] <DaveMethvin> but everything is working on node 0.6 and grunt 0.3
[10:25:16] <DaveMethvin> now if you ask me HOW i got it to work.... sorry :/
[10:30:43] <danzik171> DaveMethvin: looks like it depends on how git resolves - my path had C:\..\git\cmd originally which makes git resolve to git.cmd
[10:30:59] <danzik171> changing that to the \bin folder so it resolves to .exe works around that bug it looks like, so now it builds
[10:31:19] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, interesting
[10:31:28] <DaveMethvin> so flakey in windows, unfortunately, and easy to break
[10:31:57] <danzik171> yup - and i never messed with my git setup, so it was broken with whatever it decided to set as the defaults
[10:38:38] <rwaldron> does ticket linking still work
[10:38:43] <rwaldron> docs#12365
[10:38:45] <bot-t> [#12365] Change all obj++ to ++obj where applicable (pending enhancement) - http://jqbug.com/12365
[10:39:13] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ^^ that's silly and will benefit jQuery in exactly zero ways
[10:39:34] <DaveMethvin> let him prove it rwaldron
[10:39:36] <rwaldron> aside from requiring us to drop all increments to -1
[10:39:42] <rwaldron> instead of 0
[10:39:53] <rwaldron> ugh
[10:40:31] <ajpiano> rwaldron: i think DaveMethvin was just going to have him spin his wheels and do it and then be likle, ok, check out all these failing unit tests, etc
[10:40:40] <rwaldron> fair enough
[10:40:49] * DaveMethvin thinks ajpiano understands
[10:41:13] <ajpiano> there's obviously no reason for us to change obj++ to ++obj
[10:41:19] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ajpiano I know that's what you meant
[10:41:23] <ajpiano> because some random guy just says "can you please do it"
[10:41:23] <ajpiano> lol
[10:41:26] <rwaldron> but it seems like a waste of our time
[10:41:31] <rwaldron> is why I "ugh"ed
[10:41:37] <rwaldron> it's closable now
[10:41:44] <DaveMethvin> hey if he wants to take the time, more power to him
[10:42:04] <DaveMethvin> he's not putting it on OUR stack of stuff to do, i can tell you that
[10:42:28] <rwaldron> we have to respond when he comes back with "evidence"
[10:42:33] <rwaldron> and review the "evidence"
[10:44:06] <ajpiano> rwaldron: we also have mandatory inspections of the length of the unicorn's horn
[10:44:17] <ajpiano> ?iykwim
[10:44:18] <bot-t> if you know what i mean
[10:47:20] <rwaldron> ajpiano I'm stoked for construction this weekend
[10:47:25] <rwaldron> what tools do you have?
[10:47:27] <ajpiano> me toooooooo
[10:47:27] <rwaldron> skilsaw?
[10:47:42] <ajpiano> lets do this in pm lol
[11:06:42] <paul_irish> unrelated to the actual bug report
[11:06:51] <paul_irish> is Safari for Windows supported for now?
[11:07:01] <paul_irish> i suppose so, as it hasnt been a pain thus far.
[11:07:12] <paul_irish> the user numbers must be deplorable though
[11:09:05] <snover> paul_irish: saf for windows is def a pain to support.
[11:09:18] <snover> it has always had weird glitchy bugs that saf mac has not had
[11:09:21] <paul_irish> iirc, it has less users than ie6
[11:09:29] <snover> yeah, *nobody* uses it
[11:10:21] <mikesherov> yeah, I'm wondering if it effects anything else, but we'll never know because the guy reporting won't provide a repro
[11:11:17] <paul_irish> http://oksoclap.com/AoDJDlSQRc
[11:11:21] <paul_irish> inapprops? cc ajpiano
[11:12:26] <ajpiano> i don't think you need the paraenthetical but otherwise no not inapprops
[11:12:41] <paul_irish> k same.
[11:13:13] <ajpiano> paul_irish: did you see my analogy
[11:13:24] <paul_irish> something about a banana in the tailpipe
[11:13:27] <ajpiano> yea
[11:13:49] <paul_irish> hey i agree with the premise that the team can't proceed
[11:13:59] <paul_irish> i mean.
[11:14:07] <mikesherov> I could've avoided all this without being so aggro
[11:14:09] <paul_irish> ![](repro_or_gtfo.jpg)
[11:14:26] <ajpiano> i mean theoretically, we could install kentico cms on windows box with safari 5
[11:14:38] <ajpiano> so that all 1 people who have ever been affected by this can have the bug fixed
[11:14:47] <mikesherov> I think their "fix" breaks a support test
[11:17:11] <ajpiano> i just have a strong suspicion that this is likely a codemirror bug
[11:17:35] <ajpiano> and/or saf for windows
[11:18:21] <mikesherov> this is why a repro would be awesome
[11:18:31] <paul_irish> yes
[11:19:03] <paul_irish> pretty much any software project cant fix a bug without a repro
[11:19:04] <paul_irish> so
[11:19:09] <paul_irish> that's just how it is
[11:19:11] <mikesherov> LOL
[11:20:06] <paul_irish> yehuda will post that
[11:20:11] <ajpiano> we get bogus reports like this one all the time, not sure why this one is deserving of such a robust backrub
[11:20:20] <mikesherov> +1 ajpiano
[11:20:31] <mikesherov> it's because we made a public show out of it
[11:20:34] <ajpiano> this isn't the first time someone has been like "no, i won't repro, if you guys don't care, eat it"
[11:20:44] <mikesherov> it won't be the last either
[11:20:52] <paul_irish> yup and its a real product not some shitty developer with a shitty understanding of everything
[11:22:38] <ajpiano> just a shitty understanding of some things, like how to file a bug
[11:23:15] <mikesherov> or how to respond
[11:23:20] <mikesherov> he responded snarkily
[11:23:33] <mikesherov> accusing us about nonsense of the quality of our "product"
[11:27:45] <gnarf> of course he's snarky, he spent all that time "fixing" this "bug" and we are going to ignore it
[11:27:46] <gnarf> ;)
[11:43:51] <gnarf> clarkbox: you around?
