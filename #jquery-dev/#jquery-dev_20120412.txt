[07:07:07] <rwaldron> goddamnit
[07:07:09] <jaubourg> yep and I liked that on facebook :P
[07:07:15] <rwaldron> this table is weird
[07:07:25] <rwaldron> its the wrong height for my chair
[07:07:32] <rwaldron> and making me type weird
[07:07:49] <gnarf> the chairs resize bro
[07:07:57] <jaubourg> anyway, I'm not supposed to be that sensitive, I was really brown when I was younger but I so got unused to sunlight
[07:07:57] <gnarf> i just tested
[07:08:00] <rwaldron> i tried!
[07:08:00] <gnarf> i got "dirty"
[07:09:07] <gnarf> maybe its the chairs that are strange - not the table
