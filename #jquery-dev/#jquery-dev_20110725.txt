[04:22:59] <addyosmani> hey dmethvin
[04:23:08] <addyosmani> oh. not here. whoops.
[06:26:35] <jaubourg> hi there
[06:51:21] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: size should go through attr or prop?
[06:52:16] <scott_gonzalez> is the rule as simple as if it's valid to write as an attribute and it's not a boolean, then it goes through .attr() ?
[06:56:34] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: yea, booleans are special because the attribute does not stay up to date with the property
[06:57:53] <scott_gonzalez> ok, thanks
[06:57:53] <timmywil> manipulating other attributes does what you would expect
[06:58:07] <timmywil> np
[08:52:06] <jaubourg> meeting today?
[08:52:14] <DaveMethvin> hope so
[08:52:33] <DaveMethvin> i added something to the agenda for that ticket we talked about yesterday
[08:52:40] <jaubourg> heh, got closed since then
[08:52:59] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah!
[08:53:00] <jaubourg> it appears the inline content does not work with async (probably checks for the latest script in the doc
[08:53:00] <DaveMethvin> well good
[08:53:01] <jaubourg> )
[08:53:15] <jaubourg> yeah
[08:53:22] <jaubourg> there's one I'd like to talk about though
[08:53:43] <jaubourg> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9883
[08:54:07] <DaveMethvin> I'll add it
[08:54:20] <DaveMethvin> are you for it, or against it?
[08:54:41] <jaubourg> I'm for what I'm defending in the comment :P
[08:54:47] <jaubourg> that is against xhr-specific callbacks
[08:54:59] <jaubourg> for using Deferred.progress when they'll be available
[08:55:06] <jaubourg> hi louisremi :)
[08:56:50] <gnarf> is docs#9381 on the agenda? :)
[08:56:52] <bot-t> [#9381] animations halt when the browser is out of focus due to requestAnimationFrame (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/9381
[08:57:22] <jaubourg> should be if not
[08:57:34] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: feel like hosting the meeting?
[08:57:38] <DaveMethvin> sure
[08:57:44] <DaveMethvin> is ajpiano around?
[08:57:45] <jaubourg> great :)
[08:57:48] <jaubourg> dunno
[08:57:53] <jaubourg> oh John's here
[09:02:30] <louisremi> hi jaubourg!
[09:03:03] <gnarf> i apparently don't have edit on the agenda, so can't add it :)
[09:56:06] <scott_gonzalez> so, I've got a bug with a reduced test case and but no sane summary for a ticket
[09:56:24] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsfiddle.net/r6zFU/1/
[09:56:28] <scott_gonzalez> that crashes IE 7
[09:57:00] <scott_gonzalez> the best summary I can think of is ".removeAttr( "id" ) crashes IE 7 sometimes"
[10:02:16] <gnarf> louisremi: so whats this attack, i'm curious ;)
[10:04:02] <jaubourg> louisremi: then it's a firefox bug
[10:04:12] <jaubourg> that being said, gotta fly ;)
[10:04:28] <louisremi> good bye!
[10:04:33] <louisremi> So, let me repeat
[10:04:36] <DaveMethvin> bye jaubourg
[10:04:43] <louisremi> (should I, actually?)
[10:05:11] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin thats an awful mentalimage
[10:05:13] <louisremi> It won't solve our problem since setTimeout is also "slowed down" in Firefox, in inactive tabs
[10:05:24] <rwaldron> you with a pile of tickets, in a bag, talking to them
[10:05:32] <timmywil> jaubourg: laterz
[10:05:33] <rwaldron> "hey guys, it's gonna be ok"
[10:05:35] <DaveMethvin> ughhh
[10:05:48] <DaveMethvin> my little pretties
[10:05:48] <rwaldron> jaubourg later dude
[10:06:05] <rwaldron> hahahaha
[10:06:11] <gnarf> later jaubourg
[10:06:14] <DaveMethvin> louisremi: really? setTimeout is slowed in firefox?
[10:06:20] <DaveMethvin> how slow?
[10:06:36] <DaveMethvin> does Einstein know about this new form of time dilation? :P
[10:06:46] <gnarf> another side convo http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6150#comment:10 -- note the "onstop" discussion there JohnResig - got an opinion on that?
[10:07:09] <DaveMethvin> i'm filing a bugzilla bug, "firefox defies the laws of time and space"
[10:07:11] <gnarf> louisremi: is setInterval also "slowed"
[10:07:27] <rwaldron> "trixie OPs's-es come to steal my precccioooouusss"
[10:07:36] <rwaldron> say "OPs's-es" like "hobbits-es" ;)
[10:07:58] <DaveMethvin> well in some ways that could be good, b/c we can tell ppl that they just need to write their code "correctly" rather than depend on us to hack it for them
[10:08:21] <louisremi> DaveMethvin: 1 every second
[10:08:43] <louisremi> gnarf: yes, setInterval is slowed down in the same way
[10:08:43] <DaveMethvin> wow, even for a 10ms timeout?
[10:08:52] <louisremi> yep
[10:08:58] <DaveMethvin> sweet!
[10:09:07] <gnarf> louisremi: so, you have a potential way to address that?
[10:09:31] <louisremi> possibly, I'll update you asap to see if it worked or not
[10:10:06] <gnarf> cool, lemme know, cuz if not, I'm gonna try to wire up the setTimeout like jaubourg described more than my 10 second mockup on that branch
[10:10:23] <louisremi> gnarf: ok, sure
[10:10:37] <gnarf> anyone got a comment on the approach on 6150?
[10:12:19] <rwaldron> timmywil gotta sec?
[10:12:51] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: which comment?
[10:12:58] <gnarf> #10 DaveMethvin
[10:13:01] <gnarf> the "onstop" idea
[10:13:09] <gnarf> it helps me solve some issues in UI too
[10:13:37] <timmywil> rwaldron: headed to lunch, back in a bit
[10:13:45] <gnarf> also, I'm not sure this is "intended" but if an anim is in a "delay" its not ":animated"
[10:14:22] <gnarf> which kinda makes sense in the scope of delay()
[10:14:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[10:14:31] <gnarf> but if you are looking at like the UI Split effect, which proxies
[10:14:38] <DaveMethvin> the onstop seems like a useful feature
[10:16:53] <rwaldron> le sigh
[10:17:02] <rwaldron> I'm just going to talk to a wall
[10:17:33] <rwaldron> Dear wall, I have a patch that depends on another patch
[10:17:41] <rwaldron> Is there a Santa?
[10:17:46] <scott_gonzalez> so we've got a new header for source files, huh? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/442/files
[10:17:48] <rwaldron> will he review my Pull Request?
[10:17:57] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez only for minified
[10:18:07] <rwaldron> and thats closed
[10:18:22] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: so the build process is changing the header?
[10:18:31] <rwaldron> by reason of misunderstanding
[10:18:34] <rwaldron> yeah
[10:18:40] <rwaldron> in post-compile.js
[10:18:58] <scott_gonzalez> hmmm....ok
[10:18:59] <rwaldron> will make a smaller header for jquery.min.js
[10:19:03] <scott_gonzalez> right
[10:19:22] <rwaldron> there is discussion on jquery-bugs-team, one sec, will get you the link
[10:19:27] <scott_gonzalez> just thinking if we can generalize this so that we do it properly in projects
[10:20:44] <rwaldron> there is still some discussion about removing the date altogether from the minified header
[10:20:51] <rwaldron> which I would honestly prefer
[10:20:53] <rwaldron> one sec
[10:20:54] <scott_gonzalez> me too
[10:21:03] <rwaldron> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/443
[10:21:16] <rwaldron> good, glad to hear there is more support in that direction
[10:21:26] <rwaldron> i'd love to remove that abomination
[10:23:11] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, I don't see a reason for the date to be there
[10:23:20] <scott_gonzalez> we don't think it's important enough to include anywhere else
[10:23:53] <rwaldron> initially i included it because the full source has the date
[10:24:13] <rwaldron> but then after more thought and discussin with matjas, it became clear that it was just unnec.
[10:24:24] <scott_gonzalez> oh, so it does, didn't even notice it
[10:24:38] <scott_gonzalez> we don't include dates in UI
[10:25:01] <rwaldron> i think it's redundant
[10:25:12] <rwaldron> the version number is sufficient
[10:25:36] <scott_gonzalez> mobile doesn't have it either
[10:25:37] <scott_gonzalez> color does
[10:25:55] <rwaldron> ack, i need food
[10:26:00] <rwaldron> i'll be back in a few mins
[10:26:05] <rwaldron> i removed the date stuff
[10:26:12] <rwaldron> and I'm way happier about it now
[10:26:16] <rwaldron> PR updates
[10:26:18] <rwaldron> updated*
[10:37:25] <gnarf> hey rwaldron - you mentioned being heavy inside .data() right now?
[10:44:05] <rwaldron> sort of
[10:44:52] <rwaldron> I'm fixing all of the weird camelCase => with1Numbers3 => hyphen-junk
[10:46:03] <bot-t> [#9634]  (new bug) - http://jqbug.com/9634
[10:49:10] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: ok to close https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/435 ?
[10:49:32] <DaveMethvin> oh, HE reopened it
[10:49:48] <gnarf> he also closed it
[10:49:50] <gnarf> :)
[10:49:59] <gnarf> i assume it was the comment & close button
[10:50:04] <gnarf> but i would close it
[10:50:13] <gnarf> i don't think we are pulling that exact method anyway
[10:54:24] <gnarf> rwaldron: seems you me and louisremi account for over half the pulls ;)
[10:54:51] <rwaldron> i have another coming
[10:55:08] <rwaldron> that stupid <td>t</td> that eff's up mobile browsers
[10:55:18] <rwaldron> can totally be a non-breaking-space
[11:16:49] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin good to go on that suggestion to move the camelCase check to _after_ the property check
[11:17:04] <DaveMethvin> sweet!
[11:17:11] <rwaldron> so, I'm pushing that change now
[11:17:14] <rwaldron> thanks for the review
[11:17:17] <rwaldron> much appreciated
[11:17:21] <DaveMethvin> sure
