[11:03:11] <eddiemonge> scott_gonzalez: thats much more clear
[11:03:27] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks for pointing it out.
[11:17:57] <m_gol> what's happened to IRC logs? they stopped recording a few days ago
[11:19:48] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: Probably related to the ZNC change.
[11:20:03] <scott_gonzalez> clarkbox gnarf
[11:21:54] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i thought clarkbox moved this over to the new server
[11:21:58] <gnarf> jqlog: is here
[11:22:13] <snover> DaveMethvin: i feel soooo neglected
[11:22:24] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah
[11:22:27] <DaveMethvin> so
[11:22:35] <DaveMethvin> that looked good
[11:22:40] <DaveMethvin> although i fear its size
[11:23:10] <DaveMethvin> how much bigger did it get?
[11:28:40] <snover> assuming that uglify does as you say and deletes the duplicates variables, and you stripped it, it would be zero bytes bigger for the monolithic build
[11:29:46] <DaveMethvin> i'm not sure if it would *delete* them...although it might
[11:30:01] <m_gol> probably it would be the best to just check it ;)
[11:30:03] <DaveMethvin> i think it was a question of whether stripping the fn wrappers would break anything
[11:30:12] <DaveMethvin> if there were duplicately named vars
[11:30:12] <m_gol> are we talking about 1.10?
[11:30:15] <DaveMethvin> no
[11:30:49] <DaveMethvin> i think we have what we need done for 1.10
[11:31:07] <DaveMethvin> i just need to run thru some final tests
[11:31:14] <DaveMethvin> since swarmy is not functional afact
[11:32:02] <DaveMethvin> but this change wouldn't introduce any functional difference or new api, if that's the case it could roll in before 1.11
[11:32:03] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: 2 tickets are left, aren't they?
[11:32:11] <DaveMethvin> lemme check
[11:32:18] <m_gol> 1 sourcemap-related & 1 tabindex-related
[11:33:01] <DaveMethvin> i was just leaving 13801 open to do a final check
[11:33:04] <DaveMethvin> i think it's working
[11:33:30] <DaveMethvin> does sourcemap work reliably for you always m_gol?
[11:33:45] <DaveMethvin> sometimes it seems a bit flakey even when it has the right line numbers
[11:33:58] <DaveMethvin> kind of hard to describe
[11:34:55] <DaveMethvin> oh where is the tabindex one?
[11:35:31] <DaveMethvin> let me see if i can get timmywil to chime in since he was involved in the original ticket
[11:35:33] <m_gol> well, I've run it with a few online checks
[11:35:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah the sourcemap is right according to the checks, but it just doesn't always do what you think
[11:36:07] <m_gol> http://sokra.github.io/source-map-visualization/
[11:36:13] <m_gol> agreed
[11:36:21] <m_gol> but still better to have it right for the release ;D
[11:36:51] <DaveMethvin> i think maybe 10 people in the world are using this right  now
[11:36:57] <DaveMethvin> with jquery that is
[11:37:37] <DaveMethvin> clearly not many people are building web-oriented software with sourcemap or IE would be totally hosed
[11:37:48] <DaveMethvin> app-oriented closed software, s ure
[11:37:51] <DaveMethvin> but not web-oriented
[11:37:58] <m_gol> well, I hope not that many people use conditional compilation in IE
[11:38:08] <m_gol> and it's required to trigger the bug
[11:38:12] <DaveMethvin> if they use some of the older shim/shiv stuff
[11:38:13] <DaveMethvin> they do
[11:38:28] <m_gol> ahh, right, that
[11:38:38] <DaveMethvin> and there's a surprising amount of dumb software out there
[11:38:49] <DaveMethvin> i think even one of the $.browser replacements uses it
[11:39:05] <snover> DaveMethvin: more shared variables can be put into more shared-vars modules but then youâ€™re bloating the optimized case to make the monolithic case smaller
[11:39:08] <m_gol> well, if they use the old shim version they are not mostly interested in new stuff like source maps ;)
[11:39:44] <snover> anyway, iâ€™ve yet to update any build scripts
[11:40:18] <DaveMethvin> thing is, not all of those truly need to be shared, they were more about making the code smaller
[11:40:35] <DaveMethvin> so it seems ugly to create a shared var module for something like that
[11:40:51] <snover> function define(deps, fn) { buildDepsList(deps); fn.toString().slice(â€¦); } is kind of what the build process would look like
[11:41:48] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I just did a basic check: a page with 5 divs, $('div').hasClass('aaa') with breakpoint inside the hasClass loop
[11:42:14] <m_gol> in the full version this[i] points to the proper div, in the minified one, always to the last
[11:42:25] <m_gol> so no, it's not working fully correctly
[11:42:38] <m_gol> but I'd still at least want to have it correctly generated in 1.10 :)
[11:42:39] <snover> iâ€™ll wait till this other convo is done :)
[11:43:18] <DaveMethvin> m_gol was this in ref to a ticket?
[11:43:25] <DaveMethvin> oh the map
[11:44:30] <DaveMethvin> if the diag tools say the map is okay, that's good enough for me
[11:45:02] <DaveMethvin> it's not something we're breaking ... could be an uglify issue
[11:59:57] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: so, can I merge it?
[12:00:13] <DaveMethvin> go for it m_gol, it's better than what is there
[12:00:20] <m_gol> k, thx

[12:17:12] <m_gol> ok, source map fix landed
[12:17:24] <m_gol> the tabindex one is the only one left to investigate I believe
[12:17:45] <m_gol> that is

[13:17:36] <snover> DaveMethvin: well anyway. i need to understand what youâ€™d want to do about the optional dependencies
[13:17:41] <snover> seems like they should be likeâ€¦split out
[13:21:47] <DaveMethvin> snover which ones?
[13:21:58] <snover> i added todos
[13:22:08] <snover> let me give you a link
[13:22:38] <snover> https://github.com/csnover/jquery/compare/HEAD...2.0-amd
[13:24:15] <DaveMethvin> okay, right, so if the header says it IS dependent then it can't be excluded
[13:25:13] <DaveMethvin> if we weren't already using promises there i'd just to back to a simple list for all cases
[13:26:25] <DaveMethvin> perhaps the build process could shim it 
[13:27:46] <DaveMethvin> sorry i have to run...
[21:46:44] <snover> `tell gnarf GithubPlugin 1.2.0, at https://github.com/csnover/github-trac, in conjunction with Trac 1.0, fixes the changeset-not-linking issue

[21:58:06] <snover> gnarf: the old code was so sad
[21:58:15] <snover> they took the built-in commit notification module and hacked it
[22:10:52] <snover> anyway, it updates the local mirror and then does the proper changeset notification call now
