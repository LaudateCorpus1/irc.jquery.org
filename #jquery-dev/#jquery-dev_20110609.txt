[07:07:41] <jzaefferer> hey guys, you broke the build: http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquery/ - one of the support tests is broken: http://swarm.jquery.org/?state=runresults&run_id=21679&client_id=7967
[07:07:54] <jdsharp> yo!
[07:07:56] <jdsharp> Dan you around?
[07:08:03] <jdsharp> I'm fixing api.jquery.com
[07:08:17] <ajpiano> i think he just roused
[07:10:18] <jdsharp> and we're back
[07:12:14] <ajpiano> thanks jdsharp
[07:12:47] <jdsharp> you're welcome :) though I'm not sure who fixed what first, myself or Dan. We were sword fighting on the server
[07:13:09] <ajpiano> i'l just visualise a group ambush
[07:14:41] <jdsharp> that's pretty accurate
[07:45:21] <DaveMethvin> hey guys!
[08:04:20] <louisremi> Hey
[08:53:55] <ben_alman> ajpiano, is there a plugins site meeting today?
[08:53:58] <ben_alman> i don't know the schedule
[08:54:16] <ajpiano> i don't think so if only because there is also a selectmenu meeting at the same time
[08:54:20] <ben_alman> k
[08:54:28] <ajpiano> i think we'll start those next thurs
[09:01:55] <ben_alman> i'm making headway, slowly but surely, in my build tool
[09:02:22] <ben_alman> most of it, no joke, is figuring out how best to do stuff in node
[09:02:37] <ben_alman> like print to console, parse options, etc
[09:02:47] <jonathansampson> I keep hearing ,ore and more about node each day.
[09:02:59] <ben_alman> jonathansampson, it's buzztastic
[09:03:10] <jonathansampson> Going to need to look into it if this reputation keeps in my face.
[09:04:17] <tbranyen> node has redefined programming
[09:04:45] <ben_alman> lol
[09:24:59] <jzaefferer> yeah, like there weren't systems decades ago that did cooperative multitasking :p

[15:10:28] <Krinkle> Hi folks
[15:10:42] <Krinkle> I was just wondering, are "you", jQuery developers, using the TestSwarm ?
[15:10:48] <Krinkle> Or is it more of a demo showing off testswarm ?
[15:11:07] <Krinkle> It looks kinda broken/ignored to me.
