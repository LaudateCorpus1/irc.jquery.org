[06:14:40] <jqcommit> 13testswarm/06projects-4 1420c2da3 15Timo Tijhof: (DRAFT) Branch 'projects-v4'...
[06:15:14] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: since jqcommit is here‚Ä¶ how's the projects refactoring going?
[06:15:34] <Krinkle> I underestimated the staleness of the branch but I"m getting real close now
[06:15:59] <Krinkle> Feel free to try it out if you like. Couple things left to fix, but it is functional
[06:16:17] <Krinkle> create project, login, add job, view projects > project > job > run
[06:18:30] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: http://cl.ly/image/1x3O1G0Z2c24
[06:19:11] <jzaefferer> should I start with a fresh TestSwarm install?
[06:19:35] <Krinkle> for now, yes. create a new mysql db, update localSettings.json to point to that one, run dbInstall.php
[06:20:59] <Krinkle> user>projects is a breaking change, but it'll be the last one in the -alpha cycle. I think we can declare semver from here on with 1.0, so no breaking changes anymore (perhaps maybe in 2.0 but that's gonna take a while)
[06:21:59] <jzaefferer> okay
[06:29:03] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: how do I create a project?
[06:29:15] <Krinkle> from the command line, manageProject.php
[06:29:42] <Krinkle> see the commit message, documentation to come: https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/commit/20c2da3353ec5c568bfa8e6f8f6371c1e1a03926
[06:29:42] <b-ot> Krinkle: Timo Tijhof (1w 4d ago): (DRAFT) Branch 'projects-v4'  == Project system ==  The old situation lead to a user table containing a messy mix of passwordless "client" accounts, unused accounts with passwords from people using "signup", and "project" accounts that submit jobs. This blurry distinction has been made strict now. Nobody can sign up from the web anymore. To join the swarm for test running, simply join directly (which is how it was already), c
[06:35:41] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: The job api now also aggregates the status to a single field
[06:35:44] <Krinkle> http://cl.ly/image/3g1U221S0E1v
[06:35:57] <Krinkle> which makes node-testswarm a lot easier by not having to dig through
[06:36:04] <jzaefferer> ah, nice
[06:36:15] <Krinkle> and it makes it possible to display it nicely on the jobs page
[06:36:24] <Krinkle> kinda like the jenkins dashboard
[06:37:25] <jzaefferer> I'm working through a few ThemeRoller things, will get back to testing this afterwards
[06:37:33] <Krinkle> ok

[07:16:24] <jzaefferer> *does expect
[07:16:27] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: it is parsed by a native php function, whatever your php version supports
[07:16:30] <Krinkle> I think --foo=bar
[07:16:48] <jzaefferer> okay, well, I tried the other one, as the help text suggests, that isn't working
[07:16:58] <jzaefferer> PHP 5.3.15
[07:17:17] <Krinkle> both should be fine
[07:18:05] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: http://php.net/manual/en/function.getopt.php#getopt.examples-2
[07:18:12] <Krinkle> --required value --optional="optional value"
[07:18:15] <Krinkle> both are used there
[07:19:12] <jzaefferer> weird. space separator doesn't work here
[07:19:17] <jzaefferer> anyway, I managed to create a project
[07:19:59] <Krinkle> you can use the token you got to submit a job through the API
[07:20:11] <Krinkle> or, log in via the browser and go to "Add job"
[07:20:20] <Krinkle> it'll prefill a temporary token
[07:20:51] <Krinkle> swarm is going "504 Gateway Time-out" again
[07:20:53] <Krinkle> crap
[07:20:58] <Krinkle> "502 Bad Gateway" now
[07:21:06] <Krinkle> why is this happening every other week
[07:22:02] <Krinkle>  connect() to unix:/var/run/php5-swarm.sock failed (11: Resource temporarily unavailable) while connecting to upstream, client: 91.205.96.13, server: swarm.jquery.com, request: "GET /result/1162928 HTTP/1.1", upstream: "fastcgi://unix:/var/run/php5-swarm.sock:", host: "swarm.jquery.org"
[07:22:11] <Krinkle> yeah, mysql going away
[07:24:47] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: node-testswarm complains, so I create a job manually and ran that. Test runner claims to have finished it instantly, but apparently it failed to submit results
[07:26:32] <Krinkle> It worked fine last I tried, but it could be anything at this point. I'm in the middle of it. Feel free to debug it if you can find the cause, but may be better to wait. Could be a simple typo I'll catch in review.
[07:26:37] <Krinkle> not worth the effort right now
[07:26:50] <jzaefferer> yeah, I don't see anything obvious
[07:27:02] <jzaefferer> let me know when I should be testing again
[07:27:06] <jzaefferer> or reviewing

[09:02:06] <DaveMethvin> timmywil gibson042 rwaldron mikesherov jaubourg gnarf orkel meeting time!
[10:39:08] <scott_gonzalez> Holy shit, who is doing this?
[10:39:16] <scott_gonzalez> "For example, a common monkeypatching technique I've seen is grabbing a function exported by the component, calling toString on it, doing some regexp search/replace on that string and then doing new Function() with the result and sticking it back on the component.  And people get outraged if this breaks because the toString of the function changed in any way."
[10:39:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah i wondered as well
[10:39:34] <DaveMethvin> we shouldn't be bending standards to accommodate that shit
[10:39:53] <DaveMethvin> make it clear from the beginning that anyone who does that is risking their own code
[10:40:01] <snover> hahahaha what in the world
[10:40:27] <snover> why can‚Äôt you just fix the code to not use closure so this always works, dave?
[10:40:33] <scott_gonzalez> snover: That's a quote from bz on public-webapps
[10:40:48] <snover> ‚Äúcommon‚Äù methinks not
[10:40:55] <scott_gonzalez> I'm shocked that it's common.
[10:41:06] <snover> i‚Äôve seen a lot of shit code and i have never seen that.
[10:41:10] <scott_gonzalez> I've never even heard of people doing that. It seems like the highest level of crazy.
[10:41:15] <DaveMethvin> common as in a few people who screwed up yelled to cover up their incompetence
[10:41:32] <snover> common as in mozilla hires the best of the best
[10:43:02] <scott_gonzalez> And this is why I have a no-analogy rule:
[10:43:03] <scott_gonzalez> This is probably true, but IMO it's akin to
[10:43:03] <scott_gonzalez> saying chefs should only use butter knives because they could cut
[10:43:03] <scott_gonzalez> themselves on the sharp kind.
[10:43:12] <scott_gonzalez> No, more like saying that the kind of knife the chef is using shouldn't be forced depend on where they got their tomatoes from, so when the chef develops RSI they can use a more ergonomic knife to cut the tomatoes.
[10:43:40] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez you SUCK at analogies
[10:44:06] <scott_gonzalez> How would you know? I NEVER USE THEM!
[10:44:09] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[10:44:47] <scott_gonzalez> How's this? I suck at analogies like web developers suck at their job ;-)
[10:45:06] <scott_gonzalez> Crap, is that a similie? I don't even know my grammar...
[10:45:26] <scott_gonzalez> And why doen't simile have an i at the end?
[10:46:12] * scott_gonzalez rage quits his own discussion

[11:09:54] <siovene> Dinner time now. ->
[11:14:09] <rwaldron> gibson042 I'm reviewing your changes to data, re: object.define
[11:14:41] <rwaldron> all of these changes are steps that I worked through while doing the rewrite and dimissed for one reason or another
[11:15:22] <rwaldron> right down to calling the method "key" (originally) and changing it to "locker"
[11:30:09] <Krinkle> ajpiano: Not sure who to ping, but it looks like the events site fell into an age old trap: Section anchors that don't take the sticky header into account
[11:30:10] <Krinkle> http://events.jquery.org/2013/portland/#callforpapers
[11:30:13] <Krinkle> text cut off
[11:34:20] <gibson042> great minds, rwaldron :D
[11:35:03] <ajpiano> hrm
[11:35:45] <ajpiano> Krinkle: are you able to see this repo https://github.com/jquery/web-events/
[11:35:55] <Krinkle> Yes
[11:36:11] <ajpiano> great, then file an issue there :)
[11:36:34] <rwaldron> gibson042 um... not sure what you mean
[11:36:38] <rwaldron> I didn't want to call key
[11:36:50] <rwaldron> locker was more appropriate of name for what it was doing
[11:37:04] <rwaldron> your expando is coming up NaN
[11:37:17] <rwaldron> and making a property called NaN
[11:38:27] <rwaldron> gibson042 the issue is that you're using jQuery.expando before it gets defined
[11:38:32] <rwaldron> so it's "undefined"
[11:38:36] <rwaldron> rather...
[11:38:38] <rwaldron> undefined + 1
[11:38:41] <rwaldron> NaN
[11:38:53] <rwaldron> if you do...
[11:39:00] <rwaldron> jQuery.expando + (type + "")
[11:39:03] <rwaldron> you get:
[11:39:06] <rwaldron> undefined0
[11:39:07] <Krinkle> lol, I just read NaN as Naan (india flatbreads)
[11:39:09] <rwaldron> undefined1
[11:39:11] <Krinkle> Delicious :)
[11:43:41] <Krinkle> ajpiano: https://github.com/jquery/web-events/issues/3
[11:50:14] <ajpiano> thanks Krinkle
[12:04:00] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: This new db schema is making data a lot easier to query, check the new client page for example: http://cl.ly/image/2S2B2C2W2p2W
[12:04:16] <Krinkle> can you see exactly what the client is doing, no more black box with 3 minutes delay
[12:08:46] <jzaefferer> nice
[12:09:09] <Krinkle> bbl
[12:30:28] <gibson042> rwaldron how would you feel about moving jQuery.expando to core? right now it's also used in event and ajax/jsonp
[12:30:46] <rwaldron> gibson042 it should definitely be in core
[12:30:58] <rwaldron> it needs to move to fix this issue anyway
[12:31:03] <gibson042> exactly
[12:31:09] <rwaldron> i should've included that in the PR
[12:31:10] <rwaldron> sorry
[12:31:13] <gibson042> np
[12:31:35] <gibson042> I'm separating the support changes and will do the same with expando, then rebase the PR
[12:32:21] <gibson042> also, 2.0 doesn't need the .replace anymore :)
[12:36:59] <gibson042> I'm thinking about replacing Math.random() with -new Date() too
[12:37:17] <snover> that was changed intentionally
[12:37:43] <gibson042> I expected as much
[12:37:49] <gibson042> do you know why?
[12:37:50] <snover> multiple jquery copies were dangerously close to being able to init within the same millisecond
[12:38:13] <gibson042> was version part of the string at the time?
[12:38:25] <snover> you can load two separate copies of the same version of jquery
[12:38:40] <snover> SlexAxton can say more, it was his fault
[12:38:49] <snover> what *I* say is: use amd already
[12:39:04] <gibson042> +1
[12:39:14] <snover> and, you know, don‚Äôt use such an identifier
[12:39:23] <snover> but it‚Äôs kind of hard
[12:39:26] <snover> since it gets put on the elements
[12:39:32] <snover> you can‚Äôt really a separate copy of those
[12:39:41] <gibson042> exactly
[12:39:45] <gibson042> allright, random it remains
[12:40:16] * gibson042 contemplates doing the same with Sizzle...
[12:41:04] <SlexAxton> resig actually made the final call to do Random
[12:41:10] <SlexAxton> but it's probably a good move
[12:41:31] <SlexAxton> V8 could instantiate 2 jQueries within 8ms of eachother 1.5 years ago
[12:42:44] <snover> of course there is also the alternative path: ‚Äúif you want to load multiple jqueries it is your responsibility to make sure that they all have unique expando values‚Äù
[12:42:47] <snover> :)
[12:43:19] <snover> and then just set the expando back to a static value and do that thing where the sunglasses slide down from the top

[14:42:14] <scott_gonzalez> mkwst: I want to discuss http://dev-test.code.dev/behavior/mouseover-when-element-is-shown.html with browser vendors. Who should I contact for WebKit?
[14:42:49] <snover> i would like to discuss that url with you
[14:42:56] <scott_gonzalez> ugh
[14:43:02] <scott_gonzalez> s/code.dev/nemikor.com/
[14:43:13] <scott_gonzalez> http://dev-test.nemikor.com/behavior/mouseover-when-element-is-shown.html
[14:44:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'm heading out right now, but reply here or message me directly and I'll see it when I get back.
[14:44:17] <snover> you don‚Äôt want to hear from me but what i will say is that emitting on a display change like that makes consistent implementation in user-land like‚Ä¶impossible
[14:44:49] <snover> or at least, much more complex than just looking for a mousemove event
[14:44:55] <snover> (mousemove/touchmove/MSPointerMove)
[14:45:00] <snover> (/thenextbigthingmove)
[17:46:18] <scott_gonzalez> snover: Why is that?
[17:46:38] <snover> scott_gonzalez: why is it more complex than just looking for a mousemove?
[17:47:02] <scott_gonzalez> Yes.
[17:47:08] <scott_gonzalez> And *what* is more complex?
[17:47:47] <snover> implementing the behaviour where the mouseout/mouseover events fire simply in response to a display change, if you were (for example) creating a faux dom in canvas
[17:48:01] <snover> the only reason why i say this is because i just spent the last 3 days writing code to create a faux dom in canvas‚Ä¶
[17:48:50] <DaveMethvin> another case that seems tough for a browser, if someone uses the scroll wheel but doesn't move the mouse pointer ... it's a special case because you can't just listen to mousemove to determine mouseover/out anymore
[17:49:09] <DaveMethvin> and an element appearing under a pointer is similar
[17:49:29] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Browsers actually have even different behavior for that.
[17:49:44] <DaveMethvin> i've seen the bug with scroll wheel before
[17:50:09] <scott_gonzalez> You'll actually get hover for anchors in WebKit.
[17:50:15] <scott_gonzalez> If you're scrolling.
[17:50:32] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't done extensive testing to see if it's all natively focusable elements or just anchors.
[17:50:41] <DaveMethvin> now that i use the touchpad i don't notice it a lot
[17:50:42] <scott_gonzalez> But the test page shows it's clearly not divs...
[17:51:08] <scott_gonzalez> Well, 2 finger touchpad scroll (or edge touchpad scroll) is the same as mousewheel.
[17:52:29] <DaveMethvin> yeah but i always figure a mousemove works its way in somehow
[17:52:51] <snover> at least you get an event for mousewheel
[17:53:19] <snover> no cssom event for ‚Äúhey an element just showed up, you should check to see if it‚Äôs in your way‚Äù
[17:53:36] <snover> i was going to say no events at all but they did bodge in that fucking awful transitionend event
[17:53:45] <DaveMethvin> unfortunately, the event.target for mousewheel can be a text node still
[17:53:46] <snover> ‚Äúsure, this‚Äôll fire, maybe, if there is a transition‚Ä¶‚Äù
[17:54:20] <snover> i wish that people would spend less time making javascript ‚Äúeasier‚Äù and spend more time making stuff actually possible
[17:54:29] <DaveMethvin> well now we can just complain and mkwst will fix it! :D
[17:54:31] <snover> ooh fat arrow, ooh destructuring assignments, boy oh boy
[17:54:36] <snover> whatever did we do without those
[17:54:53] <snover> oh, i know. we wrote self = this and used intermediate variables.
[17:55:17] <DaveMethvin> have you "met" mkwst snover? he's on the webkit team and volunteered to look at some of our persistent core bugs
[17:55:34] <snover> no, i have not met him in that way
[17:55:37] <snover> or in any way
[17:55:44] <snover> but definitely not in the way that involves quotes
[17:55:49] <DaveMethvin> so he's like miketaylr but probably more handsome.
[17:56:00] <snover> oh well in that case, maybe you can ‚Äúintroduce‚Äù me
[17:56:24] <DaveMethvin> as long as he puts dojo bugs below jquery bugs, sure :)
[17:56:36] <snover> aww man, come on, it‚Äôll all be the same thing before long
[17:56:45] <snover> p.s. where are my modules :)
[17:56:58] * DaveMethvin disappears
[17:57:10] <DaveMethvin> we're working on it
[17:57:15] <DaveMethvin> damn, 9pm already
[17:57:28] <DaveMethvin> i've been digging out my inbox all evening
[17:57:34] <snover> oh, funny you would mention that
[17:57:45] <snover> i was just thinking about how fucked i am with the number of unresponded emails i have
[17:58:01] <snover> 272 inbox
[17:58:16] <DaveMethvin> you could have helped that Nigerian prince!
[17:58:22] <DaveMethvin> but no
[18:04:24] <snover> oh that reminds me i have to go tell someone their code sucked so i had to rewrite it
[18:07:21] <snover> thanks a lot for reminding me of all the horrors dave
[18:07:54] <DaveMethvin> lets go dig up some graves sometime
[18:09:36] <snover> that would be a million times less terrifying
[18:09:37] <snover> oh well
[18:09:45] <snover> that‚Äôs one more IBMer that hates me now
