[13:25:48] <johnkpaul> does anyone have any idea why this particular test would take double the amount of time when run with other tests? https://github.com/johnkpaul/jquery/blob/speed_up_effects_tests/test/unit/effects.js#L547
[13:25:59] <johnkpaul> it's "animate hyphenated properties" in unit/effects
[13:26:10] <johnkpaul> ^@ gnarf
[14:00:46] <gnarf> hrm
[17:21:51] <johnkpaul> gnarf: I'm really confused by that one and the time required for the toggle state tests
[17:22:05] <johnkpaul> but all of the other ones have been straightforward
[17:22:29] <johnkpaul> down to ~ 5 seconds
