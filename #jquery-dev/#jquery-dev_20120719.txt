[05:14:59] <scott_gonzalez> b-ot: tell DaveMethvin you need UI 1.8.22 next week?
[05:15:00] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez, I’ll tell DaveMethvin about that.
[06:05:13] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: i wish there was a way to tag "jqueries"
[06:05:24] <ajpiano> without like, it being so damn obvious
[06:05:32] <DaveMethvin> well THEY don't know what it means :D
[06:05:32] <b-ot> DaveMethvin, you have one new message, just say “read” to me when you wish to read it.
[06:05:41] <DaveMethvin> b-ot: read
[06:05:41] <b-ot> DaveMethvin, from scott_gonzalez, 50m 41s ago: you need UI 1.8.22 next week?
[06:06:22] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: http://oksoclap.com/jqueries
[06:06:31] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: rc1 is coming out, probably weds or thurs
[06:07:12] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[06:07:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'll plan on having 1.8.22 ready so that people can easily test that against 1.8rc1.
[06:08:09] <scott_gonzalez> If we need to, we'll do 1.8.23 to fix any remaining bugs with 1.8-compat.
[06:08:14] <DaveMethvin> we'll plan on some subtle bug that breaks it right after you release then :)
[06:08:19] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[06:08:34] <ajpiano> intersting google autocompletes when you type "how does jquery" into the address bar
[06:09:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah how DO we make money?
[06:09:16] <scott_gonzalez> QUORA TO THE RESCUE!
[06:09:31] <DaveMethvin> oh i am so over quora
[06:09:35] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: i thought it was, you supply the copy machine, i supply the green paper, and scott_gonzalez brings the toner
[06:10:07] <scott_gonzalez> That plan fell apart when I brought Panera Green Tea instead of toner :-/
[06:10:12] <DaveMethvin> i think we should strike some jQuery coinage
[06:10:26] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: like the credit cards?
[06:10:33] <scott_gonzalez> What ever happened to that anyway?
[06:10:45] <ajpiano> i think it's still hapening
[06:10:51] <scott_gonzalez> They might be as slow as ECMA.
[06:10:52] <DaveMethvin> dunno, i think we were waiting on new graphics?
[06:11:01] <DaveMethvin> I want a coin with "In John We Trust" on the front  and "Write Less Do More" on the back
[06:11:01] <scott_gonzalez> No, we submitted the designs.
[06:11:14] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: you think it's *easy* to  just *print* a credit card?
[06:11:21] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe we can get one of those machines that flattens pennies with a new design :-)
[06:11:27] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[06:11:38] <ajpiano> it's not like they just send unused credit cards to your mailbox every single day
[06:12:01] <scott_gonzalez> My kids love playing with those...
[06:12:32] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: http://www.rockyrockholt.com/products.html
[06:12:35] <ajpiano> no pricing information though
[06:13:03] * DaveMethvin goes to update the budget with another marketing item
[06:13:10] <ajpiano> but we should probably get one for our corporate headquarters in delaware
[06:13:20] <ajpiano> make it into a real Attraction™
[06:13:28] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Don't forget to include the cost of shipping that to every conference ;-)
[06:13:49] <DaveMethvin> imma keep it in my basement, you ship me the pennies
[06:14:26] <scott_gonzalez> The machine on a post is pretty cool.
[06:15:28] <DaveMethvin> omg, that is an incredibly old version of jquery they're using
[06:15:38] <scott_gonzalez> They're $5k
[06:17:38] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: omg is that a pre 1.0 version
[06:17:48] <ajpiano> jQuery.fn.jquery -> $Rev: 249 $
[06:17:52] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[06:17:58] <DaveMethvin> and it STILL WORKS
[06:18:08] <DaveMethvin> damn non-breaky software
[06:18:14] <ajpiano> maybe we can offer to upgrade their site and maintain compat with all plugins
[06:18:18] <ajpiano> for one free peny machine
[06:20:34] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: You should get jQuery back down to that size :-)
[06:21:14] <DaveMethvin> damn, i'
[06:21:21] <DaveMethvin> m out of witty comebacks for scott_gonzalez
[06:22:00] <ajpiano> ideally, this is where you could just placate him with a shiny flattened penny with a pic of john's face
[08:39:25] <addyosmani> Who would be the best person to speak to about edit privs on docs.jquery.com?
[08:40:51] <ajpiano> addyosmani: you need them?
[08:40:53] <ajpiano> or someone else does?
[08:40:55] <addyosmani> yessir
[08:40:57] <addyosmani> I need them
[08:41:13] <ajpiano> ok but what do you need to edit
[08:41:36] <addyosmani> Tutorials page. I know its being blown away but we've got a few dead links on there that could be cleaned up.
[08:41:43] <ajpiano> oh
[08:41:45] <addyosmani> if the official take is 'its going away' happy to close tickets with that
[08:41:46] <ajpiano> yeah, that page is the worst
[08:42:13] <ajpiano> it's going away i'm pretty sure
[08:43:05] <ajpiano> it just seems like a crazy thing for us to curate manually
[08:43:09] <addyosmani> I think so.
[08:43:20] <addyosmani> im happy its going away. seems insane to try curating long term
[08:43:47] <ajpiano> addyosmani: it says you are already sysop
[08:43:55] <addyosmani> hmm.
[08:44:11] <addyosmani> okay. i'll try again. might have just been a temp sys issue not letting me in.
[08:45:24] <ajpiano> are you Addyosmani
[08:45:34] <addyosmani> lowercase a
[08:45:48] <ajpiano> i think it treats those at the same
[08:45:48] <addyosmani> but if its in the sys with a cap, I can try logging in with that too
[08:45:51] <addyosmani> cool
[08:46:16] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: around? CI meeting soon
[08:46:39] <Krinkle> Yep, right here :)
[08:46:42] <Krinkle> added some initial notes, in case I missed the time slot
[08:47:55] <Krinkle> omg, spammers found out about Google Calendar. You can invite people and by default it will show up in their calendar even if the invitation e-mail goes to spam
[08:48:26] <ajpiano> oh god
[08:49:02] <Krinkle> http://cl.ly/image/090s2j1h2f0w
[08:49:25] <Krinkle> http://cl.ly/image/3j163t160n0K
[08:50:14] <addyosmani> bummer. looks like you have to share that fortune with 40 other people ; )
[09:07:15] <gibson042> .
[09:14:03] <gnarf> kswedberg: you around
[09:14:04] <gnarf> ?
[09:32:13] <Krinkle> addyosmani: hehe :D
[10:26:33] <scott_gonzalez> I guess this is part of B2G? https://developer.mozilla.org/en/API/WebSMS/Introduction_to_WebSMS
[10:26:57] <scott_gonzalez> When is core gonna add support for text messages?
[10:28:34] <scott_gonzalez> bugs.forEach(function( bugNumber ) { sms.send( DaveMethvin.cell, "Why isn't #" + bugNumber + " fixed yet?!?" ); }); :-P
[10:29:25] <DaveMethvin> i can deal with 150 text messages :D
[10:37:17] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: you around?
[10:37:30] <DaveMethvin> yes indeedy gnarf
[10:37:54] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/56
[10:37:54] <ben_alman> DaveMethvin: have you seen http://johnbender.us/2012/07/19/splitting-jquery-in-two-a-proposal/
[10:37:54] <socialhapy> ★ Github API: no issue found
[10:38:13] <DaveMethvin> nope, looking
[10:40:11] <DaveMethvin> gnarf, can you summarize for me, that's a lot of reading and my skim did not extract the key points
[10:42:33] <DaveMethvin> wouldn't adding a new low-level api just trade off faster speed for larger size?
[10:42:51] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: can you help me test the new blog.jquery.com rq
[10:43:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah just switching to that
[10:43:02] <gnarf> since you are the biggest user of its backend prolly :)
[10:43:17] <gnarf> maybe you wanted scott_gonzalez's summarize?
[10:43:45] <DaveMethvin> so is blog ported to a new server now? Seems to be okay
[10:44:02] <DaveMethvin> if it's ported and I can't tell the difference, that's a good thing, right? :)
[10:45:40] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: did you drop the line in your hosts file from issue 56?
[10:45:58] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: not sure what you mean "larger size"
[10:46:17] <gnarf> johnbender: code size
[10:46:21] <gnarf> gzipped bytes
[10:46:26] <DaveMethvin> right
[10:46:36] <johnbender> gnarf: right, but I don't think it would be massive overhead
[10:46:39] <DaveMethvin> gnarf no, missed that bc i thought bens link was yours
[10:46:40] <johnbender> you're adding a function wrapper
[10:46:44] <johnbender> obviously you would have to look into that
[10:46:58] <johnbender> curious to get feedback from you guys
[10:47:24] <DaveMethvin> johnbender: well if you add 15% size to get 25% speed improvement in something that's not a bottleneck ... not a good tradeoff imo
[10:47:37] <DaveMethvin> but if you wanted to try and get real numbers i would be interested
[10:47:58] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: yessir
[10:48:08] <johnbender> it's an idea that needs further investigation
[10:48:22] <DaveMethvin> ok gnarf, sorry i didn't see that i needed to update hosts for that, doing so now
[10:48:23] <gnarf> johnbender: agree
[10:48:24] <johnbender> though I guess I can't imagine it being a 15% increase
[10:48:26] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: I only skimmed that article, but none of those graphs looked interesting, except for the last one.
[10:48:40] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: that's the main win
[10:48:48] <johnbender> there's a perf cost for being user friendly
[10:49:27] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: well, that and if you're not interested in anything but the DOM manip from core then it would be rather nice
[10:50:33] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: a 15% size increase seems like a lot but you guys know more about what to expect in terms of minification than I do
[10:50:33] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: the 404 page looks wonky: http://wnd8.com/grab/ecef07.png
[10:50:43] <scott_gonzalez> So the only big gain is to use an already existing API?
[10:50:45] <DaveMethvin> johnbender: that was just a wild guess
[10:50:51] <DaveMethvin> i don't know the right number
[10:51:06] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: not sure what you mean
[10:51:13] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: hrm
[10:51:20] <scott_gonzalez> The only big gain is from not having .removeAttr() support multiple attributes?
[10:51:46] <gnarf> sigh
[10:51:50] <gnarf> why!@#?
[10:52:11] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps this is not an article that should be skimmed?
[10:52:14] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: if you completely discount the idea of providing the DOM manip as a seperate build target, removing user friendliness is the performance win
[10:52:32] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: maybe but you picked up on the good stuff
[10:52:33] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds bad.
[10:53:05] <gnarf> johnbender: at this point you can pull out a lot of the "modules" from the source
[10:53:06] <scott_gonzalez> I do not care about the performance of .removeAttr(). I do care about support for multiple attrs.
[10:53:59] <scott_gonzalez> I've spent years rolling my eyes every time I write .removeAttr( a ).removeAttr( b )
[10:54:12] <scott_gonzalez> literally, years.
[10:54:22] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: to be clear, that is correctly a 404, but the 404 page just looks wrong
[10:54:28] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: the current 404 page looks wrong
[10:54:43] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5479
[10:54:45] <DaveMethvin> so you din't break it!
[10:55:04] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: yes
[10:55:10] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i think I'm gonna move DNS over
[10:55:28] * DaveMethvin puts on devil outfit ... DO IT
[10:56:07] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: you don't have to pull it out
[10:56:16] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: lol, the api would stay the same for jQuery methods
[10:56:50] <johnbender> I have no interest in changing the jQuery api
[10:56:55] <DaveMethvin> i got that much johnbender,  you're proposing a lower level api, right?
[10:56:59] <johnbender> yes
[10:57:05] <johnbender> purely for DOM manip
[10:57:10] <DaveMethvin> but those methods would need to be exposed, and the cost is my concern
[10:57:19] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: exactly
[10:57:41] <johnbender> I'm trying to understand scott_gonzalez's concerns to make sure that I get the right feedback
[10:58:23] <DaveMethvin> well at the moment there are no existing users of this new api ... :D
[10:58:25] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: I probably do not have a concern if the jQuery API is unchanged.
[10:58:39] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: yah that would be crazytown
[10:59:05] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: I'll do some work to see what the overhead looks like
[11:00:03] <DaveMethvin> if you look at manipulation.js for example, exposing each method would be very costly from a bytes standpoint
[11:00:20] <DaveMethvin> the internal code is basically factored into a small set of reused methods like domManip
[11:00:38] <DaveMethvin> so the jQuery methods themselves are only one or two lines in many cases
[11:00:56] <DaveMethvin> and taking the jQuery.fn out of them would double the code size for those methods
[11:01:13] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: are you site admin on blog.jquery.com ?
[11:01:22] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: can you a) promote me, b) upgrade wordpress? :)
[11:01:23] <DaveMethvin> prolly
[11:02:20] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: you are now an admin
[11:02:34] <snover> don’t break it!
[11:02:46] <DaveMethvin> who are you and what have you done with snover?
[11:02:48] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: I'll take a look
[11:03:07] <DaveMethvin> ok gnarf, ready for me to update?
[11:03:11] <snover> make a backup, then break it lots?
[11:03:14] <snover> idk
[11:03:24] <snover> I guess if you want to ajpiano the blog too that’s cool
[11:03:24] <DaveMethvin> this is a new server, it can take the heat
[11:03:28] <snover> HEY-O
[11:03:31] <DaveMethvin> lol
[11:03:34] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: yeah - i also have backups :)
[11:04:12] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i keep seeing an arcane error in the error log on the new server
[11:04:24] <gnarf> [Thu Jul 19 11:03:33 2012] [error] [client 108.171.187.165] PHP Fatal error:  Call to undefined function live_preview() in /var/www/blog.jquery.com/htdocs/wp-content/themes/default/comments.php on line 100
[11:04:49] <DaveMethvin> ok updated
[11:04:51] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: also, are you sure you're on the "new" server?
[11:05:09] <DaveMethvin> 70.32.73.126 blog.jquery.com  right?
[11:05:14] <gnarf> try in a different browser
[11:05:17] <gnarf> chrome likes to cache dns
[11:05:21] <gnarf> even when you change hosts file
[11:06:20] <gnarf> and yes- thats the correct IP
[11:07:12] <DaveMethvin> how will i know i'm on the right server?
[11:07:23] <DaveMethvin> or the wrong one for that matter? :D
[11:07:47] <DaveMethvin> pings telling me the host file works
[11:07:57] <DaveMethvin> and i upgraded *some* server :P
[11:08:06] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: not the one i'm seeig
[11:08:10] <gnarf> soi think your on the old
[11:08:32] <DaveMethvin> i was using ie to avoid chrome caching it
[11:08:39] <DaveMethvin> and then i went over to firefox
[11:08:48] <DaveMethvin> i still have safari and opera left
[11:09:10] <gnarf> lol
[11:09:16] <gnarf> hit /dave/methvin
[11:09:21] <gnarf> i am watching the access log
[11:10:32] <DaveMethvin> imma clickin boss
[11:10:40] <gnarf> sigh
[11:10:50] <DaveMethvin> in safari, let me proxy this and see waht ip it is going to
[11:14:00] <DaveMethvin> hey gnarf i can see it hitting 70.32.73.126
[11:14:15] <DaveMethvin> damn i have a lot of ethernet traffic
[11:14:23] <gnarf> damn
[11:14:26] <gnarf> thats a wrong ip
[11:14:27] <gnarf> 216.70.110.52
[11:14:46] <snover> you broke it?
[11:14:50] <DaveMethvin> let me just put this cold porridge back before the bears return ....
[11:14:51] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: sorry
[11:16:21] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: yay it's asking me to update ... didn't i already do that? :P
[11:16:27] <DaveMethvin> well imma do it agin
[11:16:27] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: :)
[11:17:11] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: also, make me admin againn? :)
[11:17:30] <DaveMethvin> what did you do with the last admin i gave you? :P
[11:18:32] <DaveMethvin> okay, gnarf, it is updated and you are admin
[11:18:35] <DaveMethvin> everything went better than expected
[11:18:39] <DaveMethvin> SO FAR
[13:00:23] <danheberden> gnarf did caching break?
[13:00:32] <gnarf> danheberden: no effin clue
[13:00:36] <gnarf> danheberden: im totally lost here
[13:00:50] <danheberden> is load skyrocketting?
[13:00:51] <gnarf> danheberden: api.jquery.com & now blog.jquery.com are dog-piss slow tho
[13:00:53] <gnarf> nope
[13:00:57] <gnarf> load is staying unde r1
[13:01:11] <gnarf> memory looks fine
[13:01:21] <gnarf> apache procs are lower than maximum
[13:01:28] <danheberden> might be mt
[13:01:52] <danheberden> since these are dv
[13:01:58] <gnarf> throttling?
[13:02:06] <snover> “memory looks fine” (mt) bahahahaha
[13:02:07] <danheberden> or something wrong on that cluster
[13:02:47] <gnarf> well like - ssh is working fine
[13:02:56] <gnarf> what could they be doing that would mess with our http?
[13:03:53] <gnarf> danheberden: isn't eol1.jquery.com a 2g(ve)
[13:03:54] <gnarf> ?
[13:04:06] <danheberden> oh they are moved?!
[13:04:28] <gnarf> danheberden: yes, api.jquery.com & blog.jquery.com are currently on eol1.jquery.com
[13:04:34] <gnarf> it was working fine
[13:04:37] <gnarf> until the load hit it
[13:04:42] <gnarf> when i moved api.jquery.com dns
[13:05:13] <gnarf> even now, there doesn't actually seem to be any performance bottleneck
[13:06:59] <danheberden> file descriptors?
[13:07:06] <gnarf> poked those up
[13:07:21] <gnarf> even tho the old box didn't have that increased
[13:10:37] <danheberden> can't allocate memory to do anything :/
[13:10:39] <gnarf> oo think i mighta found something
[13:10:42] <gnarf> yeah
[13:10:44] <gnarf> lemme fix
[13:10:52] <gnarf> i hate not having a swap file
[13:10:55] <gnarf> makes shit so fucking hard
[13:11:02] <danheberden> :(
[13:13:38] <snover> not as hard as having a hypervisor that reports more memory exists than actually exists, then rejects mallocs
[13:14:09] <gnarf> snover: true
[13:14:24] <snover> i still think you guys should see if linode would sponsor the servers instead
[13:14:42] <gnarf> snover: i tend to agree
[13:16:12] <gnarf> hrm
[13:16:17] <gnarf> i think i found a nice balance
[13:16:34] <gnarf> i found out that altering max servers in the prefork doesn't apply when you "restart"
[13:16:38] <gnarf> you have to "Stop" and "start
[13:16:56] <gnarf> so some of the tests i were doing weren't actually changing anything
[13:17:11] <gnarf> now at 80 servers it seems to not run out of ram, and also serve files decently quick
[13:17:38] <snover> apache still?
[13:17:53] <gnarf> yeah, all the new shit uses nginx
[13:18:11] <gnarf> but i was trying to "gently" move these servers off these boxes (mt) is killing without updating "too much"
[13:21:26] <gnarf> altho now things seem slow again :(
[13:27:51] <ben_alman> this is hilarious (and possibly awesome) https://github.com/shama/grunt-willitmerge
[13:34:05] <gnarf> seems a combo of keepalive and memory issues was the problem danheberden / snover
[13:34:29] <snover> gnarf: memory issues? on a (mt) server? say it ain’t so…
[13:42:07] <gnarf> snover: right?!
[13:42:23] <gnarf> snover: i love that zabbix is reporting 32gb memory available :)

[16:16:40] <scott_gonzalez> What's the best way to do this? https://gist.github.com/8d509b1716b6b9b14324#L202
[17:54:30] <jqcommit> [api.qunitjs.com] rdworth pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/pYOr2g
[17:54:30] <jqcommit> [api.qunitjs.com/master] Bump grunt-clean, grunt-wordpress, and grunt-jquery-content to latest versions - Richard D. Worth
[18:56:17] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: with .replace
[18:56:18] <gnarf> :)
[18:56:26] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[18:56:30] <scott_gonzalez> ghetto
[18:56:40] <scott_gonzalez> There should be another good way to do that.
[18:56:49] <scott_gonzalez> I'll keep it though.
[18:59:41] <gnarf> replace is the only regexp -> function in js i think
[19:03:36] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: We've got broken effects with core 1.8.
[19:04:03] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try to look into it tomorrow.
[19:04:11] <gnarf> k
[19:04:25] <gnarf> if i finish moving the rest of the sites tonight
[19:04:27] <gnarf> i might :)
[19:04:39] <scott_gonzalez> That'd be awesome.
[19:05:07] <scott_gonzalez> Some are broken in master, and more are broken in 1-8-stable.
[19:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin want to release rc1 early next week, and he wants 1.8.22 out at the same time.
[19:08:24] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/dvpHAw

[19:08:24] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Let subproject tests use their own test fixture. Closes gh-867. - Dave Methvin
[19:14:01] <scott_gonzalez> Just ran through every demo in Chrome using 1-8-stable + jquery-git.
[19:14:14] <scott_gonzalez> Effects are the only thing left that needs to be updated.
[19:15:58] <DaveMethvin> well scott_gonzalez i just borked jquery-git according to testswarm
[19:16:20] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well, that'd be nice if it was just a jquery-git bug.
[19:16:29] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's just a unit test thingy
[19:16:57] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Where's code.jquery.com/jquery-git^^^.js ? :-P
[19:17:54] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, gnarf, are we going to try to get a jquery.js build on view?
[19:21:39] <scott_gonzalez> We should improve view. to support custom refs like that.
[19:21:43] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be really easy.
[19:22:30] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be really nice to be able to do http://view.jqueryui.com/master~1/demos/whatever
[19:26:09] <i-hate-dave> Project jQuery Core build #259: STILL FAILING in 17 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/259/

[19:26:10] <i-hate-dave> * dave.methvin: Let subproject tests use their own test fixture. Closes gh-867.
[19:33:15] <DaveMethvin> yes, yes you do.
[19:59:37] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: yep, http://swarm.jquery.org/job/281
[19:59:40] <Krinkle> selector is broken
[20:22:29] <snover> oh my god
[20:22:33] <snover> call the governor
[20:54:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: add it to the "rewrite view" scripts issue?
