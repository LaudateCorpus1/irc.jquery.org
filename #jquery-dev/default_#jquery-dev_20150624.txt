[10:50:09] <markelog> timmywil: "will probably drop the performance fix in favor of features (hopefully, Chrome will improve when retrieving a computed display value"
[10:50:11] <markelog> ?
[10:50:23] <markelog> did you decide to revert it?
[11:05:02] <timmywil> that just seems to be where we're leaning
[11:05:48] <timmywil> we can't fix certain issues without retrieving computed display
[11:06:44] <timmywil> but that doesn't mean reverting everything we've done

[13:03:51] <m_gol> what's up with this terrible spam :(
[13:06:10] <arthurvr> m_gol: actually not really spam more a personal troll of mine
[13:06:17] <m_gol> :/
[13:06:26] <m_gol> I'm sorry you have to put up with this
[13:06:31] <arthurvr> m_gol: had this for months now on basically every repo I work on
[13:06:36] <m_gol> ugh :(
[13:06:57] <arthurvr> this like this but quite daily and everywhere => http://imgur.com/sRhe08Q
[13:07:43] <arthurvr> m_gol: some day he opened about hunderd tickets on a personal repo of mine :/
[13:07:49] <m_gol> :/
[13:08:31] <m_gol> Did you contact GitHub about all that? This sounds extreme, maybe they could monitor activity mentioning you more closely or sth
[13:08:56] <arthurvr> Yeah GH says theyâ€™re on it and actually accounts get taken down quite quick but still itâ€™s really time consuming
[13:09:17] <m_gol> I cannot even imagine
[13:09:41] <arthurvr> I donâ€™t actually care about what trolls say but itâ€™s god damn time consuming to clean it all up
[13:09:55] <m_gol> they must have a really shitty life if that's what they're spending time on
[13:10:19] <arthurvr> Yep. Kinda GHâ€™s fault tho. They donâ€™t even require a verification email to register an account.
[13:11:11] <m_gol> did you suggest that to them?
[13:11:18] <arthurvr> multiple times
[13:11:39] <arthurvr> this is going on since January 7 by the way :p
[13:11:42] <m_gol> wow
[13:11:50] <m_gol> I wonder why only now I started seeing it
[13:11:56] <m_gol> a couple of weeks ago at most
[13:12:15] <arthurvr> because it was mainly H5BP/todomvc and my personal repos till a few weeks
[13:12:29] <m_gol> I see
[13:13:13] <arthurvr> anyways if you see more of this just donâ€™t care and move on :p sorry!
[13:14:33] <m_gol> you have nothing to be sorry about
[13:15:44] <m_gol> I once deleted a hardcore porn image from one of jQuery issue trackers
[13:16:03] <m_gol> bbl
[13:16:35] <arthurvr> m_gol: yep pretty annoying when that happens at popular repos as it ends in thousands of mailboxes.
[14:08:38] <paul_irish> finally did the correlation
[14:08:44] <paul_irish> jquery cdn downloads 
[14:08:51] <paul_irish> and days that version was stable release
[14:09:13] <arthurvr> just saw the tweet
[14:09:22] <paul_irish> it's fairly well correlated. slight trend towards newer. but also crazy amount of 1.7.2 users.
[14:09:35] <arthurvr> https://twitter.com/paul_irish/status/613814695552749568
[14:09:42] <paul_irish> thx
[14:09:51] <paul_irish> data is here if anyone else wants to play with it https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18_ZoSaUWTUS2Xm7-R2hie3BInAZjkzpvu3FW-Rw9TP8/edit#gid=0
[14:10:59] <arthurvr> thanks
[14:11:14] <paul_irish> on 2.x it appears there's a more aggressive trend towards upgrading
[14:27:08] <m_gol> Wordpress includes jQuery 1 by default, there are others
[14:27:12] <m_gol> that might influence the numbers
[14:27:35] <m_gol> if someone didn't download/add the lib themselves, the probability of upgrading seems miniscule
[14:27:48] <m_gol> jQuery 2 is more often a conscious choice
[14:27:53] <m_gol> that's my interpretation ;)

[16:16:11] * Krinkle disabled the Jenkins job for TestSwarm
[16:19:55] <travis-ci> jquery/testswarm#42 (master - 57bc81a Timo Tijhof): The build passed. - https://travis-ci.org/jquery/testswarm/builds/68242772
[16:52:55] <m_gol> Krinkle: re https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/commit/57bc81ac5fe82438544dba99f807ee39ff64c6ec - Edge doen't officially have versions, it's just Edge. Not sure if browserMajor should really apply here...
[16:53:24] <m_gol> Krinkle: I assume it's required to pass this number?
[16:54:21] <Krinkle> m_gol: It's not required. But we do recommend a version number of sorts (just like we do for Chrome and firefox)
[16:54:29] <Krinkle> m_gol: You think Edge will start at 1.0?
[16:54:40] <m_gol> Krinkle: there is no such thing as Edge version number
[16:54:47] <Krinkle> I doubt that
[16:54:49] <m_gol> there are some numbers in the UA
[16:54:54] <m_gol> but they're not a version
[16:54:57] <m_gol> that's their policy
[16:55:10] <Krinkle> They can call themselves edge or whatever and think its evergreen, but it's an application likeanything else.
[16:55:14] <Krinkle> it'll have updates like anything else
[16:55:26] <Krinkle> how often and how carefully they distribute that is their problem.
[16:55:56] <Krinkle> if they don't expose it in the UA going forward (e.g. no 12.1 in the future) then we can drop it.
[16:59:15] <m_gol> Krinkle: it was Edge/12.0 in the previous build, now it's Edge/12.9600
[16:59:50] <Krinkle> So. Versions :)
[16:59:51] <m_gol> we'll see what they do
[16:59:57] <m_gol> it also matters what BrowserStack does
[17:00:15] <m_gol> if they just make one Edge available then specifying it on our side will only be harmful, older builds will stop working
[17:00:20] <m_gol> so it depends on many factors, I guess

[17:24:36] <doesallmagic2> Yippee, build fixed!
[17:24:36] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Core Compat build #630: FIXED in 3 min 48 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core%20Compat/630/
[17:24:37] <doesallmagic2> markelog: Attributes: fix IE8 issues
[17:27:54] <m_gol> Krinkle: FYI: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/8e111df641cca3e1b75b31a1971bfc89014b4ded#commitcomment-11850878
[17:28:08] <m_gol> so it seems "12" is just a meaningless frozen number, the build number will change
[17:28:55] <m_gol> Krinkle: it just seems to be it will be confusing to see "Edge 12" in TestSwarm interface where in fact there is no such thing
[17:29:33] <Krinkle> m_gol: We can configure the userAgent however want
[17:29:41] <m_gol> "Edge 10130" would seem more true (but still kind of awkward)
[17:29:43] <Krinkle> so in infra/testswarm we can just specify browserFamily
[17:29:46] <Krinkle> and use that
[17:29:54] <Krinkle> if we want build versions, we need ua-parser to change
[17:30:02] <Krinkle> and expose that as major version or something
[17:31:07] <Krinkle> the display label will be name, name major or name major.minor or name major.minor.patch
[17:31:12] <Krinkle> depening on what local settings specifies
[17:31:13] <m_gol> but TestSwarm in the GUI uses `${ browserFamily } ${ browserMajor }` for desktop browsers?
[17:31:23] <m_gol> ok
[17:31:29] <Krinkle> it uses however many are specified
[17:31:37] <Krinkle> and with or without device as well
[17:31:37] <m_gol> I thought it's taken from the UA, not from params passed to TestSwarm :)
[17:31:54] <Krinkle> m_gol: The testswarm home page can't know what the UA will be in the future of clients that may or may not connect
[17:31:59] <m_gol> right
[17:32:11] <Krinkle> it's a two-way match
[17:32:19] <Krinkle> which is why testswarm-browserstack is tricky to maintain
[17:32:25] <m_gol> :)
[17:32:47] <m_gol> so I guess just passing browserFamily will be fine for now, if/when BrowserStack makes >1 Edge version avaliable we can think of more specific identification
