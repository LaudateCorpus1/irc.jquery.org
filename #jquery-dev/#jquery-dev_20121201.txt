[11:07:03] <DaveMethvin> snover: are you around?
[11:07:15] <snover> DaveMethvin: WHO ME
[11:07:21] <DaveMethvin> clearly not
[11:07:29] <DaveMethvin> soooo
[11:07:30] <snover> WHATâ€™S UP DAWG
[11:07:41] <snover> is this the part where we get married or the part where you break my heart
[11:07:51] <DaveMethvin> kinda, tryna figure out who has the legal copyright to Sizzle
[11:08:18] <DaveMethvin> at one point i think dojo put it on the front stoop of jquery in a basket
[11:08:46] <DaveMethvin> so, it's in our project but we need to decide how to do the copyright
[11:08:55] <DaveMethvin> right now it's "jQuery Foundation and contributors"
[11:09:28] <DaveMethvin> which would be fine if Dojo Foundation is one of the contributors
[11:09:45] <DaveMethvin> everyone who contributed code should be in AUTHORS.txt
[11:09:46] <snover> Sizzle is a Dojo Foundation project, but being a Dojo Foundation project does not transfer ownership
[11:10:03] <DaveMethvin> all your folks signed CLA right?
[11:10:07] <DaveMethvin> but licensed to Dojo
[11:10:19] <DaveMethvin> and we've asked them to license to us via our CLA
[11:11:06] <DaveMethvin> so basically everyone listed in https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt can be considered "and contributors"
[11:11:07] <snover> The project owner (Resig) was responsible for ensuring any contributions were provided under CLA
[11:11:24] <snover> The Foundation doesnâ€™t manage day-to-day operations of individual projects
[11:11:58] <DaveMethvin> so maybe our lawyer can talk to your lawyer to make sure we're doing all this right?
[11:12:11] <DaveMethvin> cuz IANAL
[11:12:20] <DaveMethvin> an IDGAS frankly
[11:39:27] <snover> DaveMethvin: davidmarkdavidmark
[11:39:37] <snover> i have read the incantation, now you shall care
[11:39:51] <DaveMethvin> it's like kryptonite
[11:39:54] <DaveMethvin> but more annoying

[22:04:24] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: It is a bug we had last year in IE8 as well, caused by a bug in IE8 where font-size/line-height somehow has a 1px influence on the offset of a child iframe.
[22:04:59] <Krinkle> It was fixed in the previous bootstrap, and somehow it is back now. The font-size is still the same, so it is probably some other random css property this time.
