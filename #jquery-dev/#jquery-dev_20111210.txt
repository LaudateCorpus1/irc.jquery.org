[03:11:14] <cjm> is this a bug in 1.7.1? http://jsfiddle.net/eHHgP/2/  switching from 1.6.4 to 1.7.1 breaks the ability to pick up the LIs (becasue the coords are undefined)
[03:11:46] <cjm> (posting here becasue I haven't been able to find any info elsewhere)
[03:28:57] <cjm> jQuery.event.fixHooks["touchstart"] = jQuery.event.mouseHooks; jQuery.event.fixHooks["touchmove"] = jQuery.event.mouseHooks;
[03:29:52] <cjm> that's the fix i'm using. don't know why the decision was made to change this stuff though.
[03:39:07] <Zamolxe> Hello. I've created a plugin called kiNotice http://ghita.org/ux/kinotice/demo/demo.php and after I read some articles about plugin patterns I decided to go with something simple. Please take a look at the source code of http://ghita.org/ux/kinotice/jquery.kinotice.js and suggest improvements. Thanks
[07:07:24] <gibson042> .
[08:28:21] <cjm> Anyone get a chance to look at this? http://jsfiddle.net/eHHgP/2/ my touch events broke in 1.7
[08:28:34] <cjm> due to rmouseEvent = /^(?:mouse|contextmenu)|click/,
[08:32:17] <cjm> wondering if this is a bug or if there is a new way to do this stuff in 1.7 -- I do jQuery.event.fixHooks["touchmove"] = jQuery.event.mouseHooks; for now
[09:02:32] <mikesherov> cjm, did you file a bug?
[09:02:57] <mikesherov> cjm:.
[09:13:26] <Cokegod> cjm: the same thing happend to me with drag events
[09:14:46] <Cokegod> I don't know what the approach is with mobile devices, but drag events won't get fixed because it is not supported in all the browsers jQuery supports
[09:16:25] <Cokegod> at the end I did the same thing you did, and also made a plugin which is ready to be added to the new plugin site
[09:16:55] <mikesherov> Cokegod: not necessarily... report the bug to the bug tracker
[09:17:16] <mikesherov> that is the only way the team knows if it's a problem or not
[09:18:26] <Cokegod> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10729
[09:19:00] <Cokegod> it already was reported, but you can see what dmethvin wrote
[09:36:07] <gibson042> .
[09:54:20] <cjm> why did this stuff change? might just go back to 1.6.4 :(
[10:05:10] <DaveMethvin> sup
[10:28:16] <kswedberg> cjm: I'm confused about why you can't use event.originalEvent
[10:29:11] <kswedberg> cjm: anyway, DaveMethvin is in the house, and he's the one who rewrote events for 1.7, so he'd probably be the best person to answer your questions.
[10:29:42] <DaveMethvin> questions?
[10:32:05] <kswedberg> hmm. maybe cjm stepped away.
[10:34:13] <Cokegod> kswedberg: even when using event.originalEvent you still won't get the filtering
[11:00:58] <cjm> @DaveMethvin sorry, back -- just wondering how I should do this in 1.7.1 -- http://jsfiddle.net/eHHgP/2/
[11:01:08] <cjm> works in 1.6.4
[11:01:40] <cjm> just working around it for now with jQuery.event.fixHooks["touchmove"] = jQuery.event.mouseHooks;
[11:02:07] <DaveMethvin> that's webkit-specific code, right?
[11:02:12] <DaveMethvin> just use originalEvent
[11:02:28] <DaveMethvin> we're not normalizing touch events
[11:04:48] <cjm> oooo, ok, i see
[11:04:57] <cjm> thanks
[11:10:54] <Cokegod> DaveMethvin: will html5 events (not supported in IE<9) or touch events (not supported in desktop browsers) ever get this support?
[11:11:23] <DaveMethvin> i don't know, they are relatively expensive in either size or in speed
[11:11:49] <DaveMethvin> so we either need to look at the event type and copy over just the stuff that is vald, or say to heck with validity and copy everything
[11:12:24] <DaveMethvin> in which case a touchmove or mousemove event will have a huge amount of additional baggage and performance problems that you certainly might see on a phone or ipad
[11:12:47] <DaveMethvin> really if you are handling touch events, shouldn't you be looking at the pageX of the touch?
[11:13:03] <DaveMethvin> there's a different pageX/Y for each touch in the array
[11:13:17] <Cokegod> and what about html5 events?
[11:13:21] <DaveMethvin> which ones?
[11:13:29] <Cokegod> drag events
[11:13:59] <Cokegod> they aren't really different than mouse events, the only difference is the dataTransfer property
[11:14:02] <DaveMethvin> what  do you want from them?
[11:14:05] <DaveMethvin> oh that
[11:14:18] <DaveMethvin> there's an open ticket on that right?
[11:14:23] <Cokegod> yes
[11:14:28] <DaveMethvin> did you comment in it?
[11:14:33] <DaveMethvin> i t hink i asked for input
[11:14:50] <DaveMethvin> trying to figure out whether fixing it was worth the addl performance hit
[11:15:33] <DaveMethvin> in the meantime you can assign the mousehook to it, or use originalevent
[11:17:29] <Cokegod> ok
[11:55:18] <mikesherov> .
[12:02:24] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you here?
[12:02:51] <DaveMethvin> yep, what's up mikesherov?
[12:03:38] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/pull/75 can be closed now since your sizzle fix
[12:03:39] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on sizzle by sjoerdmulder (1m, 2w ago): Fixing JSLint / JSHint warning: Mixed spaces and tabs
[12:04:28] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: I converted your Event Extensions article to md for you : http://bit.ly/w0y9VC
[12:04:57] <DaveMethvin> thanks kswedberg!
[12:05:05] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: good point
[12:05:27] <mikesherov> just keeping an eye on the queue ;-)
[12:05:48] <DaveMethvin> sure, thanks...and done
[12:05:53] <mikesherov> oh, and I'm going to have a new PR to address AaronAsAChimp's fix for jqbug.com/7986
[12:06:08] <mikesherov> doc?7986
[12:06:23] <DaveMethvin> ?7986
[12:06:25] <bot-t> [#7986] Bug in $.support.boxModel if page has DIV-element CSS (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/7986
[12:06:27] <kswedberg> sure thing, DaveMethvin. not sure what md parser the site will use, but it might have a hard time with the <dl> since that syntax isn't part of the core MD
[12:06:35] <mikesherov> there we go
[12:06:56] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: yeah i am not sure either, it seems like "everyone uses md" but nobody uses the same dialect
[12:07:07] <mikesherov> I tested it pretty heavily, but would love some additional testing
[12:08:34] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg:  so should this go to learn.jquery.com now?
[12:10:01] <kswedberg> yeah, sounds right. and maybe do the excerpt sneak-preview thing for the blog in the meantime
[12:10:34] <DaveMethvin> in the learningjquery blog?

[12:12:15] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (1m, 26s ago): fixes #7986, Bug in $.support.boxModel if page has DIV-element CSS
[12:19:03] <kswedberg> I was actually thinking put it on blog.jquery.com. and ajpiano could add a note to it saying that it's a sneak preview of the kind of content we'll be seeing on learn.jquery.com
[12:19:10] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin ^^
[12:19:48] <DaveMethvin> oh, ok ... of course ajpiano also relayed a complaint that blog.jquery.com was getting too "noisy"
[12:20:05] <DaveMethvin> i guess that will be less of an issue once learn isup
[12:20:08] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: that write up is amazing
[12:20:24] <kswedberg> that complaint is just silly
[12:20:27] <DaveMethvin> amazing ==> TOO LONG
[12:20:39] <mikesherov> Oh, btw, I assume the jquery bug tracker gets regular backups?
[12:20:47] <DaveMethvin> er, um,
[12:20:57] <DaveMethvin> danheberden may know how often it gets a backup
[12:21:15] <kswedberg> danheberden: see mikesherov's question ^^
[12:21:18] <mikesherov> or, I'd rather phrase it this way: Seeing as we just saw the drawbacks of not doing regular backups, we should do a sweep and make sure other systems are backed up regularly
[12:21:23] <DaveMethvin> and i mean, what possibly could go wrong?
[12:21:33] <DaveMethvin> oh wait, does ajpiano have access to the bug tracker?
[12:21:38] <kswedberg> ha. DaveMethvin, you beat me to the danheberden callout
[12:21:39] <mikesherov> LOL
[12:21:42] * DaveMethvin runs away
[12:21:50] <kswedberg> meanie
[12:21:54] <mikesherov> but seriously
[12:22:11] <mikesherov> it would be a disaster to have something like bugs.jquery.com not backed up regularly
[12:22:44] <DaveMethvin> YOU ARE JINXING US
[12:22:49] <DaveMethvin> :D
[12:22:57] <kswedberg> mikesherov: true. we'll get danheberden on it
[12:23:35] <mikesherov> it may already be happening, I just want to double check
[12:23:58] <kswedberg> don't we all. ;)
[12:51:59] <Eviltwin> I was looking at th 1.7.1 source
[12:52:07] <Eviltwin> Noticed this weird asymmetry: http://pastebin.com/dpZikzeA
[12:53:05] <Eviltwin> I tried $(this).live("click",f); $(this).die("click",f); which didn't work
[13:00:30] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: I added your article to my local copy of the learn.jquery.com repo. looking good! http://swedberg.us/grab/evt-20111210-155857.png / http://swedberg.us/grab/evt-20111210-160011.png
[13:00:52] <DaveMethvin> wow!
[13:01:00] <DaveMethvin> looking really good, thanks
[13:01:26] <kswedberg> sure thing. :)
[13:02:01] <kswedberg> haven't pushed anything yet. waiting on ajpiano to see if he wants me to fork and pull request or just push to the main repo
[13:10:02] <ajpiano> hey
[13:10:09] <ajpiano> i'm cool with you just pushing to master for now
[13:10:26] <kswedberg> cool deal. thx, ajpiano.
[13:10:27] <ajpiano> assuming you have access to that repo already :)
[13:10:41] <kswedberg> I believe so. heh. probably should check that.
[13:11:10] <kswedberg> yep
[13:14:41] <kswedberg> ajpiano: apparently tmp/checksum and tmp/compiled_content were modified (maybe by nanoc?). and they're sourced? do I need to commit those, too?
[13:16:19] <ajpiano> no they were being tracked errantly and i stopped tracking them
[13:16:35] <ajpiano> i think you need to do like git rm --cached tmp/*
[13:16:56] <kswedberg> aha. ok, cool. thx
[13:17:38] <ajpiano> you just need to jigger around until they go away ;)
[13:17:41] <ajpiano> they're .gitignore'd now
[13:17:54] <kswedberg> gotcha. :)
[13:19:06] <kswedberg> ruh roh. seems I was working in an old repo.. oh well. I'll figure this out.
[13:21:56] <ajpiano> old repo
[13:21:59] <ajpiano> ohhhhh
[13:22:06] <ajpiano> check the readme on current one
[13:22:13] <ajpiano> we moved the url
[13:22:52] <kswedberg> k. will do. actually, maybe I'll just start over. It was pretty much just the added article (and a couple small css additions)
[13:23:32] <ajpiano> might be easier :p
[13:34:29] <kswedberg> ajpiano: pushed. :)
[13:38:14] <ajpiano> kswedberg: :D
