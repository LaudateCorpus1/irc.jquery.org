[07:37:19] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle|detached jzaefferer: Thoughts on proposed DataProviders addon? To me, it looks like a lot of overhead for what boils down to a for/forEach loop. Since we're trying to pare down our bundled addons anyway, I'm thinking we tell him "Thanks, cool, but keep it in your own account and we'll link to it from the website" https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/445

[08:56:52] <JamesMGreene> Any of you use Bower much?
[08:57:45] <JamesMGreene> Just noticed a very annoying problem where it overwrites newer version components if another component (installed later) depends on an older version
[08:58:25] <JamesMGreene> i.e. I have jQuery 1.9.1 installed, then install the latest Bootstrap... which installs jQuery 1.8.3 and blows away 1.9.1
[08:59:11] <DaveMethvin> JamesMGreene i don't use bower but that sounds bad ... it doesn't compartmentalize dependencies?
[08:59:30] <DaveMethvin> oh but this is for web apps
[08:59:35] <JamesMGreene> right
[08:59:38] <DaveMethvin> so it would be tricky i guess
[08:59:41] <JamesMGreene> but still... shouldn't the newer version win?
[08:59:54] <DaveMethvin> it should at least yell at you i think
[09:00:00] <scott_gonzalez> It depends.
[09:00:39] <JamesMGreene> DaveMethvin: agreed but it doesn't... just overwrites it silently
[09:01:03] <DaveMethvin> bower -- silent but deadly
[09:07:56] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery 1.x Core build #146: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%201.x%20Core/146/

[09:07:57] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #809: STILL FAILING in 0.49 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/809/
[09:35:05] <JamesMGreene> Did more testing, apparently it only happens if you are installing packages directly (vs. a plain ole `bower install`)
[09:35:09] <JamesMGreene> Still, that's pretty bad

[09:53:31] <jdalton> word
[09:53:31] <jdalton> hey
[09:53:40] <jdalton> i used http://projects.jga.me/jquery-builder/ to make the smallest jq 2.0 build
[09:53:58] <jdalton> https://raw.github.com/jgallen23/jquery-builder/0.3.0/dist/2.0.0/jquery-ajax-css-deprecated-dimensions-effects-event-alias-offset-sizzle-wrap.min.js
[09:54:05] <jdalton> and steve's tool says its 13kb
[09:54:06] <jdalton> not 10
[09:54:07] <jdalton> wuts up
[09:54:09] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: Personally I think the data provider addon is overkill. Firstly, the signature is too long.
[09:54:23] <jdalton> http://zopflinator.org/index.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.github.com%2Fjgallen23%2Fjquery-builder%2F0.3.0%2Fdist%2F2.0.0%2Fjquery-ajax-css-deprecated-dimensions-effects-event-alias-offset-sizzle-wrap.min.js&pub=on
[09:54:35] <Krinkle> secondly, doing each( data, QUnit.test( ..., function () { ... } ) seems fine
[09:54:57] <Krinkle> Javascript is nice and flexible like that. Turning everything into a 'thing' seems overkill to me.
[09:55:24] <Krinkle> It's fine if you create such a utility within your test suite (tack it onto QUnit host object and use it), but not like a standard thing.
[09:56:01] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle: Totally agreed.
[09:58:46] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: I've responded however with a 'addons are no longer accepted to the core qunit repo' comment
[09:59:19] <JamesMGreene> That should work
[10:00:56] <JamesMGreene> Will that be 100% true, or might we still accept assertion plugins?
[10:01:18] <JamesMGreene> I still feel like we should finish splitting out the assertion plugins into their own repos
[10:01:44] <Krinkle> Yes, of course.
[10:01:50] <Krinkle> addons/ is going away entirely
[10:02:04] <Krinkle> We could extend core QUnit.assert, but not as a plugin.
[10:02:19] <Krinkle> e.g. like we added propEqual
[10:03:56] <JamesMGreene> sure but I meant more like the non-core assertions
[10:04:05] <JamesMGreene> pixelEqual, etc.
[10:05:41] <JamesMGreene> I'm thinking it's better if we just finish splitting the existing ones out, write a doc on how to extend QUnit.assert on the website, and be done with it
[10:07:05] <Krinkle> that's what we're doing already
[10:07:55] <JamesMGreene> Last I heard was that we weren't going to split out the remaining "addons/" anymore
[10:08:31] <JamesMGreene> After scott_gonzalez was pushing back a bit on having so many qunit* repos under the jquery org
[10:08:45] <Krinkle> all are going away from core
[10:08:53] <Krinkle> whether they become a jquery org repo is a different matter
[10:09:22] <JamesMGreene> Well how do we make that determination?
[10:09:30] <Krinkle> if nobody wants to take ownership, we'll move them out of core without creating a new repo.
[10:09:45] <JamesMGreene> As I've said before, I'm happy to take ownership of them
[10:09:50] <Krinkle> anyone who wants to take it in the future can pluck it out of the v1.11.0 tag
[10:10:12] <JamesMGreene> though I don't know much about the Canvas API... but that shouldn't matter too much for the assertion plugin
[10:10:32] <JamesMGreene> Not so sure about "themes", though
[10:10:43] <JamesMGreene> I probably wouldn't want to take ownership of that one
[10:10:50] <Krinkle> I'd like to take themes and phantomjs
[10:10:54] <JamesMGreene> My CSS skills aren't so great
[10:11:04] * Krinkle is a css wizard
[10:11:12] <Krinkle> (not my words)
[10:11:16] <JamesMGreene> Nice
[10:12:50] <JamesMGreene> So if I want to take ownership of the three assertion plugins, should I just do it?
[10:13:03] <Krinkle> Be sure to do it right. I'll create a list
[10:13:32] <JamesMGreene> ok, thanks
[10:13:33] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: So you'll take canvas, close-enough and step?
[10:19:05] <JamesMGreene> yeah, I'm good with that
[10:22:15] <gnarf> johnkpaul: can you link up that WIP for sinon again?
[10:22:22] <gnarf> cc DaveMethvin when it happens :)

[10:23:10] <doesallmagic> Corey Frang: updating to 2.1.2 in readme
[10:24:14] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: excuse the verbosity: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/447
[10:28:35] <JamesMGreene> No worries, thanks Krinkle
[10:29:06] <JamesMGreene> No real surprises there but I probably would've forgotten to do the post-publish version bump
[10:29:58] <scott_gonzalez> When you guys say that you'll take ownership, you mean in your own GH accounts?
[10:32:41] <JamesMGreene> scott_gonzalez: yeagh
[10:32:42] <JamesMGreene> yeah*
[10:32:46] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[10:33:02] <JamesMGreene> Less repos makes scott_gonzalez happy :)
[10:33:16] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[10:33:33] <scott_gonzalez> We're at 46 public repos
[10:33:53] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle: We missed a step, though: gotta update the website
[10:34:07] <scott_gonzalez> I'm just imagining the hundreds of lines out of output that I'm going to see when I finish the copyright audit script.
