[02:09:34] <teolicy> Hi. I've just reported a rather slight, very obvious and very easy bug (http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13525) in $.ajax()'s handling of 205 RESET CONTENT responses.
[02:10:01] <teolicy> I humbly think fixing it should take less than 10 minutes to a contributor (someone who signed the agreement, has an environment for the test suite, etc).
[02:10:20] <teolicy> A trivial jsfiddle example can be found here ( http://jsfiddle.net/Sj3a6/2/). I'll be happy to help anyone interested in closing this one quickly.
[06:49:43] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/926/files
[06:49:44] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Pull request #926 by dwaddell (30m 11s ago): jQuery.event.handle is undocumented and deprecated
[06:50:07] <scott_gonzalez> Is this the best way to be triggering the events?
[06:50:15] <scott_gonzalez> Should we use simulate?
[06:50:21] <scott_gonzalez> Or just go through normal .trigger()?
[06:50:43] <DaveMethvin> we haven't created a documented interface for this, so i think it's up for discussion
[06:50:57] <DaveMethvin> there are some reasons to go to .dispatch(), mostly perf ones
[06:51:33] <DaveMethvin> but it's back to not wanting the great unwashed to be using special events or else they'll get in our  way when fixing browser bugs
[06:52:01] <scott_gonzalez> Wait, are special events not something that users should use?
[06:52:13] <scott_gonzalez> Are they only meant for internal use?
[06:52:25] <DaveMethvin> "users" no, but framework and lib writers yes
[06:52:28] <DaveMethvin> that would be my take
[06:52:50] <scott_gonzalez> So we shouldn't use it in a demo then.
[06:53:03] <DaveMethvin> not if people will copy/pasta it
[06:53:14] <DaveMethvin> just one example:
[06:53:15] <scott_gonzalez> We copy/pasta'd from the hoverintent plugin :-P
[06:53:24] <scott_gonzalez> It's copy/pasta all the way down.
[06:53:29] <DaveMethvin> we added a jquery.event.special.click last version
[06:53:38] <DaveMethvin> if someone else had a click special event
[06:53:51] <DaveMethvin> we either clobbered theirs or they clobbered ours (the latter more likely)
[06:53:56] <scott_gonzalez> Also, it looks like to me like jQuery.event.handle isn't deprecated as this guy is claiming.
[06:54:00] <scott_gonzalez> Since it's still used in core.
[06:54:04] <scott_gonzalez> if ( bubble ) {
[06:54:04] <scott_gonzalez> 			jQuery.event.trigger( e, null, elem );
[06:54:04] <scott_gonzalez> 		} else {
[06:54:04] <scott_gonzalez> 			jQuery.event.dispatch.call( elem, e );
[06:54:04] <scott_gonzalez> 		}
[06:54:38] <scott_gonzalez> Based on that code from core, this PR looks invalid.

[06:54:46] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like the args are wrong.
[06:55:42] <DaveMethvin> for that demo i would use trigger
[06:58:02] <DaveMethvin> jQuery.event.handle isn't really there anymore, it was kind of replaced by jQuery.event.dispatch although the args are different for some corner cases as I recall
[06:58:24] <DaveMethvin> but we have a patch to make handle = dispatch so old code wouldn't break
[06:58:48] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds like fun :-P
[06:58:51] <DaveMethvin> that stuff never was documented but there were a few examples floating around from brandon that people copied
[06:59:56] <DaveMethvin> back to that PR, yes that shoudl be landed
[07:03:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'm switching to .trigger()
[07:03:43] <DaveMethvin> even better

[07:15:03] <DaveMethvin> i don't understand why that is failing
[07:15:14] <DaveMethvin> must be something simple but I don't see it
[07:15:32] <DaveMethvin> i even set 1.9-stable to the same deps as master, which isn't having this problem
[07:15:56] <scott_gonzalez> Jenkins is pretty slow :-/
[07:16:16] <scott_gonzalez> Taking forever to pull up the console output.
[07:16:44] <DaveMethvin> it's dying when trying to run grunt, been that way for several days
[07:16:46] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...grunt didn't install?
[07:16:49] <DaveMethvin> but only on 1.9-stable
[07:17:00] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know which server this is on?
[07:17:04] <DaveMethvin> no
[07:17:16] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf jzaefferer: Where is Jenkins?
[07:18:22] <scott_gonzalez> found it
[07:18:29] <jqcommit> 01[13jquery01] 15jaubourg pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/N5oLaw

[07:18:52] <DaveMethvin> now watch, that one will fire grunt fine
[07:19:11] <scott_gonzalez> Grunt 0.4.0rc5 is installed
[07:19:25] <scott_gonzalez> There is no .bin
[07:19:36] <scott_gonzalez> Which makes sense.
[07:19:50] <DaveMethvin> where is the .sh script coming from that runs grunt?
[07:20:08] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure, and the file is gone now.
[07:20:20] <gnarf> its configured inside jenkins
[07:20:26] <gnarf> jenkins box should have grunt-cli
[07:20:40] <gnarf> it does
[07:20:45] <DaveMethvin> ok, but that helps
[07:20:51] <gnarf> gnarf@jq03:~$ grunt -V
[07:20:51] <gnarf> grunt-cli v0.1.6
[07:20:56] <DaveMethvin> so the job setup must be diff between the two
[07:21:00] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pulling up the settings right now.
[07:21:06] <scott_gonzalez> Just taking forever.
[07:21:16] <DaveMethvin> yeah something is wrong with jenkins
[07:21:16] <gnarf> you can rely on the main grunt
[07:21:24] <DaveMethvin> it's been really slow
[07:21:30] <scott_gonzalez> Load average on the server is only 2.x
[07:21:43] <DaveMethvin> some kinda db problem i suspect
[07:22:15] <DaveMethvin> still haven't managed to load the main swarm.jquery.org page
[07:22:58] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I think I fixed it.
[07:23:20] <scott_gonzalez> I'm gonna kick off a build right now.
[07:23:23] <DaveMethvin> cool
[07:23:31] <gnarf> something in general is really slowing down jq03
[07:23:39] <gnarf> i think it might be the cron from view
[07:24:08] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Speaking of view, it doesn't have UI 1.10.1.
[07:25:05] <scott_gonzalez> Jenkins is much faster now, not sure if it's because I logged in.
[07:25:36] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #711: STILL FAILING in 6 min 44 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/711/
[07:25:37] <doesallmagic> j: Properly resets firingLength when emptying the list. Fixes #13517
[07:25:43] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez so it looks like you edited the command to just plain "grunt"
[07:25:48] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: should fix itself next run
[07:25:56] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Yup
[07:26:02] <scott_gonzalez> That should invoke grunt-cli
[07:26:11] <DaveMethvin> strange thing is, master still has ./node_modules/.bin/grunt
[07:26:14] <DaveMethvin> and it was working
[07:26:42] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...it shouldn't
[07:26:50] <DaveMethvin> :D
[07:27:04] <DaveMethvin> Also we're getting a lot of "bad gateway" lately
[07:27:06] <scott_gonzalez> Well, grunt is actually running now.
[07:27:13] <DaveMethvin> we need a better gateway :)
[07:27:30] <scott_gonzalez> I hear Dell is pretty good.
[07:27:46] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery 1.x Core build #78: STILL FAILING in 1 min 20 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%201.x%20Core/78/
[07:27:58] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery is a bad gateway drug, it leads to heavy JavaScript usage.
[07:28:04] <gnarf> so, like i said
[07:28:11] <gnarf> i think it has something to do with the view site cron job
[07:28:21] <gnarf> every 5 minutes it does a TON of work in the filesystem
[07:28:26] <gnarf> most of it could be avoided
[07:28:31] <gnarf> this is my main project today, rewriting this
[07:28:43] <gnarf> re: bad gateways / jq03 swarm issues
[07:28:47] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:28:48] <DaveMethvin> that would be awesome
[07:28:51] <DaveMethvin> thanks gnarf
[07:29:41] <scott_gonzalez> aw snap
[07:29:45] <scott_gonzalez> unexpected token
[07:29:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's the bad gateway at work
[07:30:04] <DaveMethvin> wanted json, got <html>
[07:30:28] <DaveMethvin> "you got html in my json!"
[07:30:52] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: You should probably update the other jobs to use just grunt.
[07:31:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[07:31:32] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, look at that, new Firefox.
[07:31:44] <scott_gonzalez> Same old Java BS.
[07:32:21] <DaveMethvin> alrighty, master was the only one still using  a path so we're good
[07:32:34] <DaveMethvin> still don't know why it was working and 1.9-stable was not
[07:33:54] <scott_gonzalez> grunt-cli
[07:34:15] <scott_gonzalez> You used to have grunt-cli listed as a dep in master.
[07:34:29] <scott_gonzalez> So grunt-cli is still installed in the Jenkins checkout.
[07:34:33] <scott_gonzalez> locally
[07:34:43] <scott_gonzalez> Which means there IS a /node_modules/.bin/grunt
[07:34:47] <scott_gonzalez> Which points to the local grunt-cli
[07:34:53] <DaveMethvin> oh it doesn't do a burn of the directory each run?
[07:35:03] <scott_gonzalez> apparently not
[07:35:09] <DaveMethvin> ohhhhh
[07:35:19] <DaveMethvin> seems like it should
[07:35:26] <gnarf> is there an npm clean?
[07:35:38] <DaveMethvin> rm -rf node_modules i suppose
[07:35:41] <gnarf> other than rm -rf node_modules
[07:35:47] <gnarf> i was thinking only get rid of unused
[07:36:02] <gnarf> save time on fresh download of all deps every build
[07:36:06] <gnarf> only changes
[07:36:14] <DaveMethvin> yeah i see your point
[07:36:27] <scott_gonzalez> npm prune?
[07:37:04] <DaveMethvin> mmmm, prunes
[07:37:09] <gnarf> that
[07:37:10] <DaveMethvin> yeah that looks like it might do the job
[07:37:11] <gnarf> yes
[07:38:08] <DaveMethvin> ok i'll try adding that before the npm install in the job?
[07:40:28] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[07:42:34] <DaveMethvin> dog walk time
[07:46:27] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15butt opened pull request #1184: IE9 bugfix (06master...06master)  02http://git.io/83QwGg
[07:48:19] <scott_gonzalez> One of these days, we'll be able to use .on() in UI.
[07:49:56] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: git-tools 
[07:50:04] <gnarf> do i have to clone myself
[07:50:45] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm thinking about adding Repo.clone() and Repo.fetch().
[07:50:54] <scott_gonzalez> Repo.fetch() would have an API which also allows cloning if it doesn't exist yet.
[07:51:16] <scott_gonzalez> Something like Repo.fetch( { remote: url }, callback )
[07:51:31] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: well, that abstraction would save me some time :)
[07:51:34] <gnarf> in the meantime
[07:52:02] <gnarf> i'll just clone it
[07:52:03] <scott_gonzalez> Well, for view, you're gonna want specific fetch rules, right?
[07:52:09] <scott_gonzalez> Or are you just going to update the config for the repos?
[07:52:14] <scott_gonzalez> And use standard `git fetch`
[07:52:53] <scott_gonzalez> Do you want it to merge or just fetch?
[07:53:02] <gnarf> I'm going to use a bare repo
[07:53:44] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so you just want fetch.
[07:53:51] <scott_gonzalez> That's good, because that's what I was thinking of using :-)
[07:54:08] <gnarf> well, i still want fetch -fup
[07:54:11] <gnarf> but i could do that myself
[07:54:16] <gnarf> was just looking for clone abstraction
[07:54:42] <scott_gonzalez> I also started thinking about how to handle empty repos: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-git-tools/wiki/Notes
[07:54:50] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what I want to do there.
[07:55:02] <scott_gonzalez> I doubt we'll ever be in that situation.
[08:07:46] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/issues/26
[08:07:47] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Issue #26 by EugenMayer (24m 46s ago): working to migrate from jquery 1.3
[08:08:13] <scott_gonzalez> I want to reply with "2 years late? D8 is already feature complete, why not just update directly to that?" :-P
[08:14:37] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Thoughts? https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/8a3eb392f7b439029e3f
[08:22:10] <DaveMethvin> lgtm scott_gonzalez, assuming those constants have been battle tested
[08:22:44] <scott_gonzalez> They're the defaults from the plugin and the value that we've been using in that demo for years.
[08:23:00] <DaveMethvin> and i doubt anyone fiddles with them
[08:23:10] <DaveMethvin> it's not part of the copy/pasta process you know
[08:23:13] <scott_gonzalez> It's honestly kind of silly. Accordions should just activate on click.
[08:23:22] <scott_gonzalez> I actually really dislike the event option for accordion and tabs.
[08:23:22] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: 
[08:23:32] <gnarf> did you know that github stores pulls in refs/pull/#
[08:23:40] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: yup
[08:23:46] <gnarf> i didn't
[08:23:50] <gnarf> you learn new things every day
[08:24:08] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, did you just find that out from the bare clone?
[08:24:48] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: let's kill it! the events option, that is
[08:25:01] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: That would make me quite happy.
[08:25:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'll add it to today's agenda.
[08:34:45] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah, my fetch actually
[08:37:36] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure jzaefferer was the one who told me about that.
[08:37:47] <scott_gonzalez> I think there was an article talking about it.
[08:44:40] <scott_gonzalez> mmm....hamantaschen
[08:45:05] <scott_gonzalez> Must be Purim.
[09:13:39] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: how would you spawn this in node: git archive 1cc5e6a001907a604b71946310149d0f7cb7c7b7 | tar -x -C ../public_html/test/
[09:13:46] <gnarf> wrong channel
[09:13:53] <gnarf> meant for -infra :)
[10:12:39] <DrFerrous> hi
[10:16:46] <DrFerrous> Hello
[10:18:33] <DrFerrous> is anyone here?
[10:18:52] <DaveMethvin> um, no?
[10:19:12] <DrFerrous> sorry, I thought I'm alone here
[10:19:29] <gnarf> $("#jquery-dev").empty();
[10:19:45] <DrFerrous> nice one
[10:20:09] <DrFerrous> I am trying to reach John Resig to ask him for something
[10:20:11] <gnarf> this is a dev chat room, it's not always chatty :)
[10:20:33] <gnarf> DrFerrous: chances of finding him here are slim
[10:20:56] <snover> DaveMethvin: decided to be a nobody today? :)
[10:21:02] <snover> much like myself everyday…
[10:21:07] <DrFerrous> also sending him a message seems to be slim too
[10:21:30] <DaveMethvin> DrFerrous i often try to avoid people asking me for something :P
[10:22:05] <DrFerrous> ok, then, just give me an advice on behalf john 
[10:22:28] <gnarf> does it have to do with the development of jquery?
[10:22:34] <DrFerrous> yes
[10:22:45] <gnarf> then shoot
[10:22:54] <DrFerrous> hit jquery.porizm.com
[10:23:09] <DrFerrous> I want his permission to use the logo
[10:23:53] <gnarf> DrFerrous: well, that's for the foundation to decide really. lemme find the document
[10:24:12] <DaveMethvin> DrFerrous interesting utility tho!
[10:24:23] <DrFerrous> thanks man ;)
[10:24:32] <DaveMethvin> did you cut the file apart yourself?
[10:24:48] <DaveMethvin> some of it is in modules but not everything
[10:24:51] <gnarf> DrFerrous: http://brand.jquery.org/logos/#the-mark
[10:25:05] <DaveMethvin> also i don't see that it is honoring dependencies
[10:25:12] <DaveMethvin> if you leave out .data() you're breaking events
[10:25:50] <DaveMethvin> pretty much if you leave out .data() you're breaking events, effects, ajax, and a bunch of other things
[10:26:16] <DaveMethvin> so to make this useful to someone you'd need to know the dependency graph of the code
[10:26:26] <DaveMethvin> for the modules we've already created you can find that in Gruntfile.js
[10:26:45] <DrFerrous> where can i find this file
[10:26:50] <DaveMethvin> but for the level of granularity you have here you would need to figure it out yourself
[10:26:55] <DaveMethvin> in the repo
[10:27:19] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery
[10:28:09] <gnarf> DrFerrous: honestly, you should stick around here
[10:28:19] <gnarf> we need some input/help with modularity over time i think
[10:28:31] <gnarf> we all have this as a goal, but there are more important things 
[10:29:07] <snover> no there aren’t!
[10:29:07] <snover> :D
[10:29:29] <gnarf> DrFerrous: so, my interpretation of those guidelines btw, you are missing the other mark - i.e. text without logo
[10:29:36] <gnarf> also
[10:29:39] <gnarf> best best
[10:29:43] <gnarf> best bet*
[10:30:20] <DaveMethvin> DrFerrous here are the lines that specify the dependencies: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L50
[10:32:22] <DaveMethvin> so when you do a build you can say "grunt custom:-effects" and remove the effects module
[10:33:36] <DrFerrous> yes
[10:34:24] <DrFerrous> i'll make some checkboxes checked forcibly if they are used by others 
[10:39:28] <DrFerrous> or it's better to use Gruntfile.js
[10:40:02] <DaveMethvin> depends on what you are trying to do DrFerrous
[10:40:29] <DaveMethvin> if you want to get down to the level you have on that page i don't think we would have that level of granularity
[10:41:12] <DaveMethvin> if you just want something that builds the modules mentioned in the Gruntfile then use that list by all means
[10:42:00] <DrFerrous> yes, i'll use it
[10:45:37] <DrFerrous> and of course i'll use the original jquery logo
[10:50:04] <gnarf> DrFerrous: read the brand guide carefully
[10:53:26] <DrFerrous> I don't have enough space in my header, i'll use regular text instead
[11:03:14] <DrFerrous> thanks guys, but I have one question before leave
[11:06:35] <DrFerrous> which is, the only open issue in my page is dependencies ?
[11:08:02] <DaveMethvin> DrFerrous as long as you preserve the copyright headers and indicate your tool built it
[11:08:07] <DaveMethvin> seems okay with me
[11:08:23] <DaveMethvin> we don't want to be getting bug reports about it
[11:09:23] <DaveMethvin> so you probably want something in the header saying which pieces were included and/or excluded
[11:09:37] <DaveMethvin> notice that the custom: option in grunt does that
[11:11:11] <DrFerrous> yes
[13:28:23] <DrFerrous> it seems to me that $.offset() does not need css
[13:39:19] <DrFerrous> please tell, I really need the answer
[13:58:45] <gibson042> DrFerrous: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.9-stable/src/offset.js#L41
[14:05:03] <Eviltwin> Not entirely sure why he didn't find that...
[14:27:06] <snover> DaveMethvin paul_irish webkitguy barfo https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22261
[14:30:28] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...So the conference hotel is a 34 minute car ride or a 1 hour walk?
[14:30:51] <DaveMethvin> average speed 8mph!
[14:30:52] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone know if you're allowed to walk the bridge?
[14:31:08] <DaveMethvin> whatsa matter, you can't swim?
[14:31:18] <DaveMethvin> how cold could it be?
[14:31:31] <scott_gonzalez> heh, I'll steal one of the safety rafts from the plane.
[14:31:42] <scott_gonzalez> Or I'll just walk off with the seat cushion.
[14:33:21] <scott_gonzalez> Nevermind.
[14:33:38] <DaveMethvin> with bags that would be a long walk
[14:33:39] <scott_gonzalez> The other airport is a much longer walk.
[14:33:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just have a backpack and a rolling carry-on.
[14:34:08] <DaveMethvin> do canadians have publict transport?
[14:34:17] <DaveMethvin> maybe we can rent toboggans
[14:34:41] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure they do. And now that I'm looking at the correct airport, I will most certainly be using their public transportation.
[14:34:47] <scott_gonzalez> Or if not, a taxi.
[14:34:55] <scott_gonzalez> Still only 30 minuts in a car.
[14:35:05] <scott_gonzalez> But Google says 5 hour walk.
[14:35:36] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: When do you get in?
[14:35:47] <DaveMethvin> lemme check
[14:36:56] <DaveMethvin> damn that 24-hour time
[14:37:02] <DaveMethvin> ok 8pm
[14:37:32] <DaveMethvin> oh man it's a DeHaviland Dash-8, that's a turboprop
[14:38:59] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, I'm on a Beech 1900 Turboprop
[14:39:02] <scott_gonzalez> It's super tiny.
[14:39:29] <scott_gonzalez> I get in at 5:30
[14:39:38] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: How about you?
[14:41:46] <nacin> Krinkle: ping
[14:41:56] <Krinkle> nacin: pong
[14:42:45] <nacin> Krinkle: I can't find anything on browsehappy.com out of the ordinary.
[14:43:04] <Krinkle> You're wordpress?
[14:43:07] <nacin> yes
[14:43:11] <Krinkle> k :)
[14:43:14] <Krinkle> Yeah, me neither
[14:43:29] <nacin> you seem to be squatting a twitter account on our behalf :-)
[14:43:57] <Krinkle> Consider it a favour, I would be a spammer.
[14:44:07] <nacin> Not sure why we never got the account.
[14:44:07] <Krinkle> I'd be happy to turn it over
[14:44:14] <Krinkle> nacin: I think I know why
[14:44:21] <Krinkle> nacin: Because you don't actually have a feed
[14:44:37] <Krinkle> It's Wikipedia hackyhackhack extraction
[14:44:58] <Krinkle> I know, cause I see those requests coming in the API here at Wikimedia :P
[14:45:10] <nacin> it throttles! only every 12 hours I think.
[14:45:21] <Krinkle> no worries, I was looking for it.
[14:45:38] <Krinkle> (and the source code confirmed it)
[14:45:39] <nacin> using Wikipedia was an evil little hack, yes
[14:45:39] <Krinkle> I love it
[14:45:56] <nacin> "I think I know why" — related to McAfee?
[14:46:04] <Krinkle> No
[14:46:09] <Krinkle> Why you don't have a Twitter account
[14:46:34] <Krinkle> Anyway, I was looking for a blog to follow, low traffic, only notable browser releases and maybe some extra high level news.
[14:46:42] <nacin> ah. we don't have a twitter account because I guess I forgot about that part when getting this launched.
[14:47:05] <nacin> we could probably do a feed based on the data, assuming that wikipedia will be quick to update (as I presume)
[14:47:12] <Krinkle> So I decided to do it via Twitter, I'm following about 12 different blogs on browser vendors (which I'd follow anyway) and aggregate them into this twitter account.
[14:47:20] <Krinkle> nacin: Indeed
[14:47:25] <Krinkle> Though you'd only have numbers
[14:47:35] <nacin> right, not links to the news and such.
[14:47:37] <nacin> clever, for sure.
[14:47:45] <Krinkle> release notes is enough
[14:48:00] <Krinkle> nacin: Maybe set up browsehappy.com/feed as a (version of) the Twitter rss feed for the account?
[14:48:07] <Krinkle> Or the other way around
[14:48:20] <nacin> more worried about this McAfee thing first :-)
[14:48:23] <Krinkle> set up a headless blog with category release and news, and let it populate twitter.
[14:48:42] <Krinkle> custom fields for the data etc. 
[14:48:43] <Krinkle> :)
[14:48:45] <Krinkle> nacin: yeah
[14:49:12] <Krinkle> nacin: btw, we spoke before right? I wonder how you knew I'd be in this channel.
[14:50:09] <nacin> Krinkle: I wrote most of web-base-template/jquery-wp-content for you guys
[14:50:21] <Krinkle> Ah, that's you!
[14:50:22] <Krinkle> Awesome
[14:50:48] <nacin> I used to idle in dev, ui-dev, meeting, and content. now just content, as I can't keep up and realize you all know where to find me
[14:50:52] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Do you know if anyone from WordPress will be at the Toronot conference this weekend?
[14:51:11] <nacin> I have no idea, will ask
[14:51:35] <scott_gonzalez> Ok. I don't have any questions/tasks, was just curious.
[14:56:21] <nacin> https://twitter.com/mjangda and maybe https://twitter.com/michaeldcain, based on initial poking around

[19:47:58] <doesallmagic> * Dave Methvin: Add warnings and ignore the built Sizzle file.
[19:48:10] <DaveMethvin> and look how FAST it runs!
[19:48:25] <gibson042> 8-)
[19:48:45] <DaveMethvin> i thought i fixed that
[19:51:21] <DaveMethvin> this whole testswarm is on my shit list
[19:52:24] <gibson042> I hear you
[19:52:39] <DaveMethvin> i don't know why i want this to run, i know it will tell me lies
[19:52:51] <DaveMethvin> well let me work on something more productive
[19:54:34] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: its not testswarm, someone uninstalled grunt from the server
[19:54:58] <DaveMethvin> why would they do that?
[19:55:04] <Krinkle> I don't know
[19:55:07] <DaveMethvin> should i add grunt as a local install?
[19:55:28] <DaveMethvin> nope on second thought i'll wait till tomorrow on this
[19:55:37] <Krinkle> did something change recently?
[19:55:52] <DaveMethvin> i think gnarf may have been working on something related today
[19:56:03] <DaveMethvin> there should be a grunt-cli installed globally
[19:56:19] <DaveMethvin> so that plain old "grunt" will run grunt
[19:56:31] <DaveMethvin> and that's what's in my job
[19:56:56] <Krinkle> Aha
[19:57:03] <Krinkle> ./node_modules/.bin/grunt -> grunt
[19:57:10] <Krinkle> It is no longer in the local .bin
[19:57:13] <Krinkle> grunt changed
[19:57:25] <Krinkle> it doesn't come with the backwards compatible bin anymore
[19:57:29] <Krinkle> grunt-cli needed now
[19:57:31] <Krinkle> which is fine, we have that
[19:57:38] <Krinkle> let me change the jenkins configuration
[19:58:11] <DaveMethvin> oh and ui probably isn't running into this b/c they are still on grunt 0.3 i guess
[19:58:30] <Krinkle> Would make sense
[19:59:04] <Krinkle> I just watched a presentation about NeXT from 1990, I thought I knew everything about NeXT and then this.
[19:59:26] <Krinkle> It's amazing, it was better than Mac OS X in some ways, which didn't happen until 10 years later
[19:59:54] <Krinkle> some of the same slides, even the same slide theme (back then it was a homebrew slide app, it later became Keynote)
[20:00:03] <Krinkle> That's like 15 years ahead of its time,its own time
[20:00:05] <Krinkle> anyway..
[20:00:08] <Krinkle> jobs buildin'
[20:00:11] <DaveMethvin> the more things change, the more they stay the same
[20:00:13] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
[20:00:28] <DaveMethvin> honest, i was using vi in 1979
[20:00:33] <Krinkle> "jQuery 1.x Core" was already updated.
[20:00:54] <DaveMethvin> what was the diff between them?
[20:00:55] <Krinkle> I was exploring outerspace in '79
[20:01:00] <DaveMethvin> i thought i did them the same way
[20:01:14] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: "jQuery 1.x Core" used "grunt testswarm"
[20:01:20] <Krinkle> the other "./node_modules/.bin/grunt"
[20:01:26] <Krinkle> "jQuery 1.x Core" was the newer one
[20:01:29] <DaveMethvin> in the jenkins job?
[20:01:47] <Krinkle> In the Configure panel
[20:01:58] <Krinkle> I re-triggered the last build
[20:01:59] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/713/console
[20:02:00] <DaveMethvin> strange it must have been in two places or something
[20:02:05] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2713
[20:02:21] <Krinkle> firefox is failing all over
[20:02:23] <Krinkle> Script error.
[20:02:24] <Krinkle> in chrome://flashfirebug/content/flashfirebug.xml on line 0
[20:02:25] <Krinkle> fuck
[20:02:33] <Krinkle> must be a browserstack issue
[20:02:39] <DaveMethvin> oh boy this town is turning into shit
[20:03:02] <DaveMethvin> sooo Krinkle do you think it would be better on saucelabs?
[20:03:22] <Krinkle> I haven't used its API yet, but it is worth a shot
[20:03:34] <Krinkle> browserstack GUI is great
[20:03:58] <DaveMethvin> i've used the sauce api, we could ignore most of it if we didn't want to use webdriver/selenium
[20:04:13] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: I just noticed we have Retina HiDPI icons in TestSwarm on these pages: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2713
[20:04:26] <Krinkle> Funny how a lazy habit turns into something cool without doing anything
[20:04:42] <Krinkle> I was lazy and re-used the higher resolution icons and set width/height on the <img>
[20:04:48] <DaveMethvin> its better to look good than to work good :D
[20:04:50] <Krinkle> so they're scaled down on the client
[20:05:11] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, page isn't loading for me now
[20:05:26] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #713: STILL FAILING in 7 min 30 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/713/
[20:05:30] <DaveMethvin> gateway timeout
[20:05:39] <gibson042> sheesh
[20:06:01] <DaveMethvin> let's see, what IS working here ... the jenkins job started
[20:06:03] <gibson042> I'm out; fingers crossed on the first good build since 1979 ;)
[20:06:16] <DaveMethvin> the more things change...
[20:06:54] <Krinkle> yeah, that's something up with the hard drive according to gnarf
[20:07:07] <Krinkle> at the few seconds it says gateway timeout, he also couldn't ssh into the machine
[20:07:11] <Krinkle> like a complete freeze
[20:07:17] <DaveMethvin> ut oh
[20:07:22] <Krinkle> deep freeze
[20:07:41] <DaveMethvin> i wonder if we could dredge up a NeXT system
[20:07:45] <Krinkle> hehe
[20:08:03] <Krinkle> I'm thinking of maybe going back to Apache for a while
[20:08:07] <Krinkle> at least that always worked fine
[20:08:13] <Krinkle> could be completely unrelated though
[20:08:26] <DaveMethvin> yeah and most of us are using Apache locally so fewer differences when testing locally
[20:08:33] <Krinkle> Yep
[20:08:33] <DaveMethvin> mostly affected jaubourg and ajax tests
[20:08:41] <Krinkle> oh, and new ajax tests
[20:08:45] <Krinkle> exactly
[20:08:56] <Krinkle> the thing is though, with this error there is nothing I can do
[20:09:06] <Krinkle> I can't ssh into the server and so stuff, I can't access the admin panel on the web
[20:09:06] <Krinkle> nothing
[20:09:11] <DaveMethvin> well imma pack i in for the night
[20:09:16] <DaveMethvin> i have a long day tomorrow
[20:09:19] <Krinkle> just sitting around waiting for the server to wake up
[20:09:30] <DaveMethvin> wanted to get a 2.0 beta out tomorrow before i go to toronto
[20:09:35] <Krinkle> not even compiling http://xkcd.com/303/
[20:09:50] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Ah, you're going to Toronto?
[20:09:50] <Krinkle> Nice
[20:10:02] <DaveMethvin> there's an xkcd for every occasion
[20:10:27] <DaveMethvin> alright thanks for your help ... may need more tomorrow
[20:10:35] <Krinkle> and even if xkcd has nothing to offer.. http://xkcd.com/1148/
[20:10:40] <Krinkle> it has!
[20:11:03] <DaveMethvin> still have some prs to land and fix whatever swarmy doesn't like, we haven't had a run i could trust for a while
[20:11:19] <Krinkle> I'll try to get at least 1 complete build for you
[20:11:29] <Krinkle> via browserstack GUI, joining swarm manually
[20:11:37] <DaveMethvin> okay, thanks a lot, see you later
[20:11:42] <Krinkle> cya
