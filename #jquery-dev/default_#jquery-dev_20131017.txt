[07:47:22] <rwaldron> kswedberg interesting
[07:49:58] <kswedberg> rwaldron: I'm not so sure now, though, because apparently it's throwing an error in IE. I thought he was just going through jQuery core and saying, "hey, this isn't a jQuery method!" But I'm probably wrong about that.
[08:27:04] <rwaldron> kswedberg no idea, which is why I want to see code

[09:13:40] <JamesMGreeneAway> Anyone working on getting Trac back up?  gnarf s5fs ryanneufeld et al?
[09:13:52] <ryanneufeld> trac is down?
[09:14:04] <JamesMGreeneAway> DB is timing out when I try to connect to a jQuery core ticket
[09:14:52] <JamesMGreene> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13274#comment:6
[09:17:36] <JamesMGreene> TimeoutError: Unable to get database connection within 0 seconds.
[09:17:36] <JamesMGreene> OperationalError(2002, "Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (111)")
[09:28:23] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: i'm on a call, can you jump on this? looks like mysql is down.
[09:28:32] <s5fs> ryanneufeld: I'll brt as soon as i can :D
[09:34:58] <ryanneufeld> JamesMGreene: s5fs I restarted mysql
[09:35:00] <ryanneufeld> seems fine now
[09:52:07] <kswedberg> rwaldron: yep, good call.
[12:08:23] <timmywil> bugs.jquery.com seems to be down http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/bugs.jquery.com
[13:10:03] <tbranyen> hey timmywil have you given any thought to how the AMD modules will be distributed?
[13:10:10] <tbranyen> will the bower.json be modified?
[13:10:36] <timmywil> the plan is to package them in a detached commit
[13:10:41] <m_gol> tbranyen: an example package is here: https://npmjs.org/package/jquery-temp
[13:10:43] <timmywil> along with built source
[13:10:51] <timmywil> that too
[13:10:53] <tbranyen> timmywil: i was just googling around detached commits for bower
[13:10:56] <tbranyen> didn't realize you guys already did that
[13:10:57] <tbranyen> owns
[13:11:35] <tbranyen> m_gol: what do you mean?
[13:11:56] <tbranyen> hrm sizzle will be packaged too?
[13:12:01] <timmywil> tbranyen: that's for NPM, but the contacts will be the same
[13:12:09] <tbranyen> ah okay
[13:12:16] <timmywil> contacts? contents
[13:12:48] <tbranyen> this doesn't actually load in Node, just using the package manager?
[13:13:03] <tbranyen> for browserify folks and such?
[13:13:44] <timmywil> yea, only the built source can be used in the Node environment, unless you defined a global 'define'
[13:14:30] <tbranyen> oh shit
[13:14:38] <timmywil> I'd consider doing something like john-david and auto-generate node modules
[13:14:42] <tbranyen> yea
[13:14:50] <tbranyen> i'm gonna have to do that for some stuff i'm working on too
[13:15:15] <tbranyen> luckily the es6 transpiler outputs clean CJS for me
[13:15:23] <tbranyen> still need to rename some packages tho
[13:15:46] <timmywil> but yea, the first iteration will still be geared towards the browser
[13:17:58] <tbranyen> timmywil: this stuff is so interesting, wonder if breaking it out enough will make it possible to fuse Cheerio and jQuery for a Node implementation
[13:18:07] <tbranyen> in the distant future
[13:19:31] <timmywil> very possible, cheerio could pull in only the methods it wants
[13:19:59] <tbranyen> yea
[13:20:18] <tbranyen> cheerio doens't want to implement all the jquery utility methods
[13:20:25] <tbranyen> so if there was a way to bridge them
[13:20:26] <tbranyen> damnnn
[13:21:15] <timmywil> killer
[13:23:13] <m_gol> btw, with the new modular jQuery I hope AngularJS switches from its jqLite poor equivalent to a custom jQuery 2.x build
[13:30:26] <tbranyen> m_gol: yeah it's what i'm doing internally in my backbone fork
[13:31:27] <tbranyen> i wrote an Almond replacement that supports optional modules, cjs lookup, and mapped globals
[13:32:09] <tbranyen> import $ from "jquery"; and support AMD, CJS, and Browser
