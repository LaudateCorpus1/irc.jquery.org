[07:09:45] <Krinkle> ben_alman: I'm afraid I might be trying to use grunt in a way it isn't supposed to
[07:10:11] <Krinkle> I'd like a central grunt file (like a jenkins child-job) and let it run on different repositories that it is given
[07:49:05] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: it's tough with international names, sometimes it just doesn't map well i guess
[07:49:19] <DaveMethvin> probably not too critical either way
[07:56:47] <gnarf> Krinkle: sounds like a grunt task to me
[07:58:57] <ben_alman> Krinkle: i was messing with something like this
[07:59:13] <ben_alman> https://gist.github.com/3819170
[07:59:24] <ben_alman> also, there's grunt-hub but i don't know if it's updated for 0.4.0 yet
[08:25:24] <Krinkle> gnarf: Yeah, I figured I'd chdir to the target repo and then run grunt with --gruntfile
[08:25:32] <Krinkle> however I'm not sure if the resolution will go properly
[08:25:57] <Krinkle> things jshintrc: '.jshintrc' should be resolved in the working directory
[08:26:05] <Krinkle> but the node modules and stuff would be where the grunt file is
[08:26:08] <Krinkle> will see
[08:26:09] <Krinkle> gotta go
[10:30:37] <gnarf> .seen Zamarok
[10:30:38] <b-ot> gnarf, I saw Zamarok 1m 56s ago, in #jquery, saying: I think so too. .load() doesn't work at all on object tags that are used for SVG :(
[10:30:43] <gnarf> can someone confirm?
[10:35:56] <gnarf> also - has anyone ever thought of moving all these wontfix svg issues into a jQuery.svg.js ?
[12:18:01] <Danwe_WMDE> Can anyone here tell me what namespaces in the jQuery.ui widget factory are good for since they won't be considered when defining the bridge and also not by the $.fn.data()
[12:23:10] <scott_gonzalez> Danwe_WMDE: They're for organizing your code and avoiding collisions outside of $.fn.
[12:32:44] <Danwe_WMDE> scott_gonzalez: but if there will be collisions within $.fn, then, is it that useful?
[12:34:06] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, $.fn is not the only way to use a plugin.
[12:34:12] <scott_gonzalez> And you can rebridge as many times as you want.
[12:35:12] <Danwe_WMDE> and, is there any reason why I shouldn't provide a structure like $.fn.mynamespace.mywidget. In the particular case $.fn.mynamespace( options ) will choose one of $.mynamespace.somewidget and initiate it, so those in the namespace are usually not used directly.
[12:35:54] <scott_gonzalez> WAT?
[12:35:54] <b-ot> you actually understand jquery code?  You are on the same level as John Resig????
[12:36:00] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[12:36:17] <scott_gonzalez> That's extremely confusing.
[12:36:35] <scott_gonzalez> So you want to do something like elem.foo({ widget: "dialog" }) ?
[12:51:46] <Danwe_WMDE> scott_gonzalez: $.valueview( { dataType: someType } ) and depending on the data type, the valueView() will know which widget serves a view for data values of that data type
[12:55:56] <scott_gonzalez> Danwe_WMDE: Sure, but why not expose the underlying widgets too?
[12:56:21] <Danwe_WMDE> they are
[12:56:24] <Danwe_WMDE> or they would be
[12:56:28] <JeroenDeDauw> b-ot: are you on the same level as John Resig?
[12:56:28] <b-ot> JeroenDeDauw, my sources say no.
[12:56:50] <Danwe_WMDE> as $.valueview.time, $.valueview.string, $valueview.xxx and so on
[12:56:50] <scott_gonzalez> Gotta go, back in about half an hour.
[12:57:10] <JeroenDeDauw> WAT?
[12:57:10] <b-ot> I used it in my website and that occured a necessity to me.
[12:57:30] <JeroenDeDauw> WAT?
[12:57:30] <b-ot> i wonder why people even use forms when they ajax anymore
[12:58:03] <ajpiano> JeroenDeDauw: what's g... nm
[12:58:04] <ajpiano> lol
[13:52:38] <Danwe_WMDE> scott_gonzalez: are you back?
[13:53:28] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[13:55:00] <Danwe_WMDE> so, still wondering what you think about this "half exposing" those underlying structures.
[13:55:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what specifically you're asking about.
[13:58:12] <Danwe_WMDE> if I would have $.valueview which would be used in most cases. $.valueview.something would be used in more specific cases or mostly by other more complex widgets implementing a view for editing a more complex value type
[13:58:44] <scott_gonzalez> And you'd $.widget( "valueview.something", { ... } ), right?
[13:59:27] <Danwe_WMDE> actuallly, no. I would have a $.valueview.widget( 'something', {...} ) which would also register the widget for $.valueview
[13:59:39] <Danwe_WMDE> registers and passes through to $.widget
[14:00:16] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[14:00:19] <Danwe_WMDE> There is also a $valueview.Widget prototype which inherits from $.Widget + some additional interfaces all $.valueview.xxx will have
[14:01:18] <scott_gonzalez> And is that $.widget( "valueview.Widget", { ... } ) ?
[14:02:06] <Danwe_WMDE> I could do that, but then, I just did some simple inheritance there + took care of the options
[14:02:54] <Danwe_WMDE> don't want the $.widget.bridge to do anything about that $.valueview.Widget since it's just a abstract definition if you want so
[14:03:57] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm..we should rip everything out of $.widget() and move it to $.widget.something()
[14:04:11] <scott_gonzalez> That way you could take advantage of everything without going into the bridge.
[14:04:29] <scott_gonzalez> So $.widget() would just call $.widget.something() and $.widget.bridge()
[14:05:00] <Danwe_WMDE> that would be nice I guess. For now I will just overwrite what the bridge does. But its no good since it would be too late, stuff already defined in the same place would be overwritten by then.
[14:05:19] <scott_gonzalez> That's easy to fix for now though.
[14:05:26] <scott_gonzalez> var old = $.fn.Widget;
[14:05:30] <scott_gonzalez> $.widget( ... );
[14:05:32] <Danwe_WMDE> mh, right
[14:05:49] <scott_gonzalez> if ( old ) { $.fn.Widget = old; } else { delete $.fn.Widget; }
[14:07:15] <Danwe_WMDE> perhaps you could take a look here too: http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikidata/Notes/valueview_Widgets But since you didn't complain about those "sub-widget" designs, I guess the design isn't that bad :)
[14:08:27] <scott_gonzalez> All of these references to $('...').valueview.XXX are they really $.fn or just $?
[14:10:05] <Danwe_WMDE> I guess both
[14:10:16] <Danwe_WMDE> $.fn.valueview and $.valueview though
[14:10:16] <scott_gonzalez> That seems bad.
[14:10:29] <Danwe_WMDE> They should still be usable independently I guess
[14:10:30] <scott_gonzalez> $.fn.foo.bar shouldn't really exist as a usable thing.
[14:10:42] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, that's not how jQuery works.
[14:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> $( elem ).foo.bar() won't have any context.
[14:11:16] <gnarf> thats why bridge makes .foo( "bar" ) work
[14:11:17] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you're using ES5 getters.
[14:12:29] <Danwe_WMDE> umm, actually I didn't think hard about that yet
[14:15:15] <Danwe_WMDE> so, I guess one simple solution would be to provide them more direcdtly after all, like $( elem ).valueview-something, not sure I like that, though.

[16:25:25] <gnarf> mikesherov: crazy in a good way, or in a why the hell would you do this to me way
[16:25:39] <gnarf> with sinon, its easier ;)
[16:26:25] <gnarf> i mean, i don't see this being at all susceptible to weird timing issues, which plague us in effects tests already
[16:26:38] <gnarf> and at worse, we spin for 1ms
[16:28:16] <gnarf> i like that it tests sync
[16:38:22] <gibson042> gnarf it's not you, it's him
[16:38:35] <gnarf> gibson042: cool - thx
[16:40:02] <gibson042> I thought it would be clear about three comments into the *first* PR
[16:40:58] <gnarf> gibson042: is that test too crazy to land?
[16:41:07] <gnarf> gibson042: also - :( 7 bytes gzip
[16:41:50] <gibson042> I kinda like it
[16:41:55] <gibson042> synchronous ftw
[16:44:38] <gnarf> i kinda like it too
[16:44:38] <gibson042> the busy loops might be avoided if you did a sinon-like temporary duckpunch of window.Date
[16:44:46] <gnarf> yeah
[16:44:52] <gnarf> i'd rather wait for sinon tho
[16:45:55] <gibson042> does oldIE complain about them, or are they short enough to not trigger the "stop this script" dialog?
[16:46:55] <gnarf> hrm, i didn't think about that
[16:46:59] <gnarf> but i don't think it would be
[16:47:06] <gnarf> lemme spawn up a oldie
[16:50:40] <gibson042> I still don't get "losing" setTimeout code... shouldn't that screw with A TON of code?
[16:50:54] <gnarf> gibson042: yeah - i know
[16:51:10] <gnarf> gibson042: 281ms btw in IE6 xp browserstack
[16:51:35] <gibson042> I guess we're clear, then
[16:51:48] <gnarf> 360 is the highest i've seen yet
[16:51:52] <gnarf> but yeah
[16:52:22] <DaveMethvin> you guys got this figured out?
[16:52:37] <DaveMethvin> i've been banging on the compat plugin
[16:53:02] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: im just curious about the approach on that test in my pull - mikesherov thinks it's crazy, gibson042 thinks its cool :)
[16:53:20] <DaveMethvin> just about ready to land a patch to jquery master to chop out 551 bytes ... :D let me take a look at your pull
[16:54:01] <gnarf> we could probably land that in 1.9 only (1022) but it should cherry-pick clean to 1.8.3 also
[16:54:46] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: since you're here, how do you feel about opening issues on jquery-compat when we land breaking changes in jquery/master?
[16:55:36] <DaveMethvin> seems like we should try to keep the two pretty close in sync, so whatever we remove should be moved almost immediately to jquery-compat
[16:56:01] <DaveMethvin> i have a feeling the unit tests for ui and/or mobile are about to explode :)
[16:57:45] <DaveMethvin> so gnarf why leave the old stuff in place?
[16:58:26] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: to land the same "frame" for all animations queued through .animate() (which is not inside the fx.tick() loop)
[16:58:44] <DaveMethvin> ah
[16:58:49] <gnarf> and keep the setTimeout in case the animations are duration: 0 or otherwise ended without starting fx.tick() loop
[16:59:27] <gibson042> gnarf: maybe you should also get rid of that dangerous `|| 0` too ;)
[16:59:57] <gnarf> gibson042: wtf
[17:00:07] <gnarf> gibson042: :)
[17:00:10] <DaveMethvin> browsers are DYIN man!
[17:00:31] <gnarf> like ( 0.5 || 0 ) crashes ?
[17:00:47] <DaveMethvin> those kind of bugs drive me crazy
[17:00:54] <gibson042> that's the word on the street
[17:01:20] <DaveMethvin> kind of takes the meaning out of "logical or"
[17:01:42] <gnarf> i don't believe it

[18:17:53] <gnarf> every ( || )
[18:18:21] <DaveMethvin> looks vaguely obscene

[18:20:18] <DaveMethvin> damn IE7
[18:20:22] <DaveMethvin> I DEMAND A RECOUNT
[18:20:36] <gnarf> same here :)
[18:21:13] <DaveMethvin> at this hour it's too close to call
[18:23:10] <gnarf> seems it actually broke it
[18:23:14] <gnarf> investigating
[18:24:50] <gnarf> interesting
[18:24:55] <gnarf> if i run the test by itself it passes
[18:25:01] <gnarf> seems its just a tricky timing issue
[18:26:02] <gnarf> this test isn't making any sense to me actually
[18:26:25] <DaveMethvin> which one failed?
[18:26:34] <DaveMethvin> looks like it's reset waiting for another run
[18:27:03] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: http://jquery.local/jquery/test/?module=effects&testNumber=551
[18:27:06] <gnarf> on master
[18:27:31] <gnarf> i got the same fail running it on its own (without the testNumber=)
[18:27:38] <gnarf> with browserstack ie7 xp
[18:29:01] <gnarf> stop() - several in the queue
[18:29:18] <gnarf> seems that the .hide() finishes before the setTimeout got called
[18:29:56] <gnarf> i'm not understanding what this is even testing btw
[18:30:11] <gnarf> because .stop() doesn't get called before/after the queue so it doesn't really verify anything
[18:30:23] <DaveMethvin> i think this test was failing long ago and i tweaked the timeouts to make it less failey
[18:30:26] <gnarf> like there should be a "2 left in queue" check after
[18:31:01] <gnarf> this test seems just plain buggy
[18:31:12] <gnarf> do you have any idea what it's testing?
[18:31:25] <DaveMethvin> agreed, i thought it was pretty sketchy when i was messing with it but figured i was just dumb
[18:31:58] <gnarf> i'm afraid of axing tests, but this one seems troublesome and like it's not actually testing something
[18:32:07] <gnarf> however
[18:32:14] <gnarf> extending the .hide( 1000 ) seems to make it work
[18:32:53] <DaveMethvin> haha now you're using my play book
[18:33:53] <DaveMethvin> i agree the test is way too flakey
[18:34:32] <DaveMethvin> as i recall the change i made was to make the first step 1500 because it finished before the timeout fired, esp when the browser was out of focus
[18:35:06] <DaveMethvin> really those timeouts coudl be much longer, b/c the settimeout kills them all anyway
[18:37:22] <gibson042> this is why I didn't land https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1020 directly

[18:37:54] <gibson042> btw, do we currently have a way to test that before committing?
[18:38:00] <gnarf> no
[18:38:16] <DaveMethvin> sure there's a way, log into browserstack with every browser :P

[18:50:15] <DaveMethvin> well you need to amend that commit to say "BREAKING UNITS"
[18:50:15] <gnarf> now there is an error in the other direction

[18:50:20] <gnarf> this makes no sense!

[18:51:56] <DaveMethvin> haha where did that extra animation come from???

[18:52:05] <gnarf> its the "inprogress"
[18:52:09] <gnarf> so now
[18:52:15] <gnarf> what is this test actually testing
[18:52:16] <gnarf> anyone?
[18:52:23] <DaveMethvin> Beuller?
[18:52:44] <DaveMethvin> i dunno
[18:53:07] <DaveMethvin> what if that test suffered an unfortunate accident?
[18:53:13] <gnarf> kinda what I'm thinking
[18:53:25] <DaveMethvin> be a shame for anything to happen
[18:53:31] <gnarf> <strikethrough>Fixing</strikethrough> units
[18:54:27] <gnarf> seems like its trying to call stop in the middle of the first animation somewhere
[18:54:44] <gnarf> but it doesn't like check the length of the queue after
[18:54:57] <DaveMethvin> yeah, and maybe it was making sure the other animations in the queue would be cleared?
[18:55:06] <DaveMethvin> but it doesn't check anything, right
[18:55:26] <DaveMethvin> altho it generally would hose the following test if it didn't work as advertised
[19:00:28] <gnarf> i think i understand what it wanted to test

[19:14:31] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: im kinda afriad of masking some bugs if we use sinon - but at the same point, the ability to write these effects tests sanely seems worth it
[19:15:46] <DaveMethvin> well at least we could do some subset of them that way perhaps, it seems like we are constantly getting fails from effects and ajax on these timing issues

[19:40:24] <clarkpan> Hello
[19:40:36] <gnarf> common ie7 ajax
[19:40:39] <gnarf> you can do it!
[19:40:42] <gnarf> clarkpan: hi!
[19:40:58] <clarkpan> could anyone advise me on using jquery with AMD?
[19:41:07] <clarkpan> i've had a look through this bug report http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10067
[19:41:35] <clarkpan> and from what i understand, the answer is pretty much to not load jquery using AMD
[19:43:14] <gnarf> i'm not sure
[19:43:17] <gnarf> mikesherov / DaveMethvin ?
[19:43:42] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[19:43:43] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #491: FIXED in 19 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/491/
[19:43:43] <doesallmagic> Corey Frang: Rewriting unit test to be less sticky based on time issues
[19:43:52] <DaveMethvin> 10067 doesn't specifically address ajax clarkpan
[19:44:01] <DaveMethvin> was there a different ticket?
[19:44:26] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: one less buggy test hopefully! :)
[19:44:34] <clarkpan> hmm it addresses asynchronous loading
[19:44:36] <DaveMethvin> we can only hope gnarf
[19:44:56] <clarkpan> and essentially jquery being loaded after the readystate change has been fired
[19:45:08] <clarkpan> and is in readyState 'interactive'
[19:45:29] <clarkpan> currently what will happen is 'ready' will be called in the catchall on window load
[19:45:33] <clarkpan> which obviously is not ideal
[19:46:20] <DaveMethvin> what benefit are you getting from lazy-loading jquery?
[19:46:24] <clarkpan> none
[19:46:27] <clarkpan> i'm just asking for advice
[19:46:31] <DaveMethvin> then don't :D
[19:46:36] <clarkpan> i'm just as happy to put it all on the page
[19:46:53] <DaveMethvin> i'm not a fan of AMD for web pages (vs apps)
[19:47:19] <clarkpan> hmm how so?
[19:47:32] <clarkpan> i'm not really that sold into AMD
[19:47:34] <DaveMethvin> it's more complexity than most people need
[19:47:37] <clarkpan> would like to see some arguments against
[19:47:38] <DaveMethvin> for a web page
[19:47:42] <clarkpan> yea very true
[19:48:11] <clarkpan> my best use case atm for it
[19:48:13] <gnarf> i think something like rjs is a better use
[19:48:23] <clarkpan> is conditionally loading scripts for responsive design
[19:48:29] <DaveMethvin> if you are using jquery with amd, generally you'd use your amd loader's ready mechanism
[19:48:36] <DaveMethvin> not jquery's
[19:48:39] <gnarf> the biuld step of require.js that is
[19:48:40] <clarkpan> does requirejs have a ready mechanism?
[19:48:47] <clarkpan> i do have rjs going
[19:48:53] <clarkpan> but i'm loading jquery first from the cdn
[19:49:03] <clarkpan> so it can't be optimised into my main script
[19:51:20] <clarkpan> yea unfortunately requirejs' ready mechanism would fall into the same trap
[19:51:29] <clarkpan> they're checking for readyState 'complete' as well
[19:51:34] <clarkpan> oh wells thx for the chat
[19:51:47] <DaveMethvin> keep it simple!
[19:51:58] <clarkpan> never!
[19:52:03] <clarkpan> overengineer!
