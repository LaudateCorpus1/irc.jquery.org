[12:23:40] <m_gol> DaveMethvin timmywil: sounds like more people have noticed the ready swallowing nature: http://blog.bugsnag.com/a-warning-about-jquery-3
[12:24:52] <DaveMethvin> we can let them know we've fixed that
[12:25:04] <m_gol> btw
[12:25:07] <m_gol> that got me thinking
[12:25:36] <m_gol> would using `fail` instead of `catch` with a throw in a timeout be better or worse?
[12:26:50] <DaveMethvin> would it matter? hmm
[12:27:00] <DaveMethvin> pinging bugsnag now
[12:28:00] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: it's always less code and it would fire a little sooner

[12:28:55] <b-ot> (DaveMethvin) @davemethvin (Dave Methvin): @bugsnag Agree w your blog about jQuery3 swallowing explicitly thrown Errors, it will be fixed in 3.1 coming soon. https://t.co/yWIi6Vworj (1 minute and 2 seconds ago)
[12:29:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah i see your point
[12:29:24] <DaveMethvin> probably doesn't matter really
[12:29:38] <DaveMethvin> since it's already left the scene of the crime
[12:29:46] <timmywil> again, he said the problem was no info
[12:29:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah and now we got info
[12:30:00] <timmywil> right
[12:30:04] <DaveMethvin> INFO!
[12:30:09] <DaveMethvin> YOU DUN MESSED UP
[12:30:44] <m_gol> :)
[12:31:21] <m_gol> timmywil: will you have time for a release today or tomorrow?
[12:31:30] <m_gol> and can we move https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3214 to 3.2.0?
[12:32:56] <timmywil> yes and yes
[12:33:40] <m_gol> timmywil: yesterday I wanted to ping you about https://github.com/jquery/jquery/wiki/Release-process/_compare/00bd35d9891a46fee5c3a162824f61f6a63e4b6d...ce69e3bb4bb614a904acfd69cc7a80f563b12650
[12:34:02] <m_gol> I agree testing on Android 2.3 was too much hassle but why did you remove the first point?
[12:34:15] <timmywil> I thought that job was removed?
[12:34:22] <m_gol> if we don't verify the browsers in the periodic job pass the tests, it's hard to say we support them
[12:34:30] <m_gol> it's till there: http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jqueryweekly :)
[12:34:36] <m_gol> Only Android & Opera
[12:34:47] <timmywil> ah, well then
[12:34:56] <m_gol> and, unfortunately, Androids do require restarting once or twice before they settle on passing the tests
[12:35:01] <m_gol> due to timeouts etc.
[12:35:14] <timmywil> I could have sworn someone told me it needed to be EOL
[12:35:23] <m_gol> haha
[12:35:28] <m_gol> perhaps only Android 2.3 :)
[12:35:31] <m_gol> not all of them
[12:35:33] <DaveMethvin> i thought we had given up too fwiw
[12:35:59] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: given up on all Androids?
[12:36:00] <timmywil> well, I can run it again, but I may not wait for it to finish every time if it takes forever.
[12:36:07] <DaveMethvin> no, on 2.3
[12:36:08] <m_gol> sure
[12:36:08] <timmywil> *add it back
[12:36:41] <m_gol> only parts of the jobs fail so restarting just the failed ones lasts less time
[12:36:50] <m_gol> but yeah, that's still a problem
[12:37:01] <m_gol> I have a local Android emulator farm that's quite fast
[12:37:10] <m_gol> and I sometimes join the swarm using them to check what's up
[12:37:15] <m_gol> but that's kind of painful
[12:37:37] <m_gol> but I'd at least want to see and entry mentioning looking at the weekly/periodic job in the release process wiki
[12:37:54] <timmywil> it's back
[12:38:09] <m_gol> thx
[12:38:20] <m_gol> what's weird is that Androids 4.3 & 4.4 are the worst
[12:38:42] <m_gol> 5.0 almost always passes, 4.2 most of the times, 4.1 often fails but one or two tests only
