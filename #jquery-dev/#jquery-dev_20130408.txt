[12:06:57] <timmywil> gibson042, DaveMethvin: unfortunately, I think I'll have to back that out completely and call this a wontfix.
[12:07:10] <DaveMethvin> ugh, what's wrong?
[12:07:10] <timmywil> unless you guys want to call document.focus()
[12:07:22] <DaveMethvin> ouch, don't really like that
[12:07:28] <timmywil> documentElement.activeElement isn't actually a thing
[12:07:43] <timmywil> it wasn't throwing an error because elem !== undefined
[12:07:53] <DaveMethvin> lol
[12:08:05] <DaveMethvin> well there was no error at least :D
[12:08:12] <timmywil> heh
[12:08:37] <DaveMethvin> the problem is that people are stumbling across this at a pretty high rate ... what change did we make that made it crop up suddenly?
[12:09:05] <DaveMethvin> btw i am looking at the related bug in event where i touch activeElement and it dies
[12:09:39] <DaveMethvin> so now you have made me sad, there is no solution and i think focusing the document seems like a bad idea
[12:10:57] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: it's probably because we force :focus through native Sizzle to avoid a chrome bug

[12:11:19] <timmywil> we could probably reduce the number if we eat the Chrome bug and use QSA
[12:11:43] <DaveMethvin> hmm, might be a safer thing
[12:11:49] <DaveMethvin> better to be wrong sometimes than to throw an error
[12:12:19] <timmywil> agreed
[12:12:22] <DaveMethvin> "which crappy browser bug should we punish ... IE or Chrome?"
[12:12:45] <DaveMethvin> i guess Chrome is the loser this time

[12:58:47] <timmywil> rwaldron: you don't like discussing on github?
[13:01:53] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: did you forget to cherry-pick your wrap module separation to 1.x-master or is it on purpose?
[13:02:37] <DaveMethvin> m_gol yeah i guess it could be moved there too ... i was just focused on getting 2.0 in shape
[13:02:50] <m_gol> sure
[13:02:55] <DaveMethvin> do you want to do a pull for that m_gol?
[13:03:00] <m_gol> ok, np. :)
[13:03:06] <DaveMethvin> there may be some issues with the tests and conflicts
[13:03:11] <DaveMethvin> but relatively easy to resolve i think
[13:03:14] <m_gol> I'll look into it
[13:03:17] <rwaldron> timmywil this conversation was JUST had on the forums
[13:03:41] <rwaldron> gibson042 ping
[13:03:51] <rwaldron> timmywil: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/what-s-the-rationale-of-not-exposing-object-s-events-handlers-collections
[13:03:58] <timmywil> rwaldron: we've been having it for a long time
[13:04:12] <DaveMethvin> oh about _data()?
[13:04:18] <gibson042> what's up rwaldron?
[13:04:18] <DaveMethvin> i'm comfortable with where we are
[13:04:26] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I know you asked for less information in compare_size, but I'm looking at the current output and I miss the diff
[13:04:40] <rwaldron>    raw     gz Sizes
[13:04:40] <rwaldron> 240615  71240 dist/jquery.js
[13:04:40] <rwaldron>  83018  29411 dist/jquery.min.js
[13:05:01] <rwaldron> I really don't want to have to stop and do the mental math everytime I run compare_size
[13:05:09] <DaveMethvin> the only numbers i care about are the min gz and comparison against the master/1.x-master
[13:05:15] <rwaldron> that's literally what computers are for
[13:05:15] <DaveMethvin> so that's three numbers
[13:05:23] <DaveMethvin> i totally agree
[13:05:34] <DaveMethvin> but i get a screenful of stuff when i want 3 numbers
[13:05:38] <rwaldron> why the hell did gibson042 take out the diff?
[13:05:42] <DaveMethvin> i think it's because compare_size is too general
[13:05:47] <DaveMethvin> it's not gone
[13:05:51] <DaveMethvin> it's there per branch
[13:06:38] <rwaldron> oh i see
[13:06:43] <rwaldron> ugh
[13:06:43] <DaveMethvin> http://wnd8.com/grab/28f627.png
[13:06:52] <rwaldron> thing is.. most of the time I just want to compare to master
[13:06:53] <DaveMethvin> but of that screen i only want 3 numbers
[13:06:57] <DaveMethvin> right
[13:07:01] <rwaldron> _sometimes_ I want to compare to another branch
[13:07:22] <DaveMethvin> well on each *build* i'd like something short
[13:07:28] <rwaldron> yeah
[13:07:31] <rwaldron> two modes
[13:07:40] <DaveMethvin> you can always have an explicit "grunt compare_size:showme"
[13:07:46] <rwaldron> yeah
[13:09:18] <m_gol> btw, DaveMethvin, I updated https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1231, sorry for forgetting about cleaning up tests after boxSizing removal!
[13:09:23] <b-ot> m_gol: Pull request #1231 by mzgol (1d 7h ago): remove support.boxModel, it's been deprecated since jQuery 1.3; add myse...
[13:09:52] <DaveMethvin> m_gol i try to run at least one unit test run on every pull, just for such situations!
[13:10:27] <m_gol> funny thing, I usually do that in Chrome at least
[13:10:44] <m_gol> I forgot this time, when it was actually needed :D
[13:11:02] <DaveMethvin> i do it more often nowadays since swarmy is basically dead
[13:11:16] <m_gol> what's happening to the poor guy? ;)
[13:11:25] <DaveMethvin> good question
[13:11:30] <DaveMethvin> i think it's a combo of things
[13:11:38] <DaveMethvin> the server we are running jenkins on is not feeling very good
[13:11:53] <DaveMethvin> and every week or so they break browserstack as well
[13:12:14] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin... what about this:
[13:12:15] <rwaldron> Running "compare_size:minimal" (compare_size) task
[13:12:15] <rwaldron>    raw     gz   diff
[13:12:15] <rwaldron>  83018  29411      = dist/jquery.min.js
[13:12:20] <rwaldron> shit
[13:12:26] <rwaldron> that's messed up
[13:12:49] <rwaldron> http://gyazo.com/49fd579d119bc62825bcbbd4f3e27514
[13:13:06] <DaveMethvin> what's the diff with tho?
[13:13:07] <rwaldron> as something like: grunt compare_size:minimal
[13:13:12] <rwaldron> master
[13:13:25] <DaveMethvin> what if you're on 1.x-master?
[13:13:57] <rwaldron> I dont have an answer for that question.
[13:14:02] <DaveMethvin> lol
[13:14:22] <DaveMethvin> let me think of my dream format
[13:14:47] <rwaldron> I'm adding this to your ticket
[13:14:53] <rwaldron> just to keep a record of it
[13:16:05] <rwaldron> grunt compare_size:minimal:vs:1.x-master
[13:16:09] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ^
[13:16:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah that could work since it would be in the gruntfile
[13:17:13] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: probably just grunt compare_size:vs:1.x-master
[13:17:42] <rwaldron> gibson042 the "minimal" is an option to only print a single line
[13:17:50] <rwaldron> should be orthogonal
[13:18:53] <gibson042> how do you do single line with "diff"... does "diff" relate to raw/gz/...?
[13:19:37] <rwaldron> damn...
[13:19:52] <DaveMethvin> it can be a few lines
[13:19:58] <rwaldron> If we did that $.events() non-sense, I'd want the returned object to be frozen
[13:20:09] <DaveMethvin> it just shouldn't be a screen full
[13:20:34] <rwaldron> gibson042, I think I was assuming the diff was just the gz diff
[13:21:17] <rwaldron> the other sizes are interesting, but when it comes down to it, the gz size is all the matters over the wire
[13:21:20] <gibson042> but compressors is just a map of label to function
[13:21:31] <rwaldron> I generally ignore the other numbers, except when they're interesting
[13:21:32] <gibson042> we could do gz AND bz, for instance
[13:24:55] <m_gol> btw, why is compare_size not invoke on custom builds?
[13:25:32] <m_gol> it's sometimes nice to see how much can be saved
[13:25:39] <DaveMethvin> yeah agreed
[13:25:49] <m_gol> * invoked
[13:25:55] <DaveMethvin> make a pull request m_gol :)
[13:31:23] <rwaldron> you can use compare_size on custom builds already...
[13:31:36] <DaveMethvin> sure but you have to TYPE
[13:31:43] <rwaldron> get over it
[13:31:45] <rwaldron> ;)
[13:31:46] <DaveMethvin> lol
[13:32:49] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron how about a horizontal layout? works for maybe 3 or 4  http://wnd8.com/grab/c5dedc.png
[13:33:22] <rwaldron> gibson042 ^
[13:34:04] <DaveMethvin> and really the file name is a waste of horizontal space, we just "dev" "min" "gzip"
[13:34:13] <DaveMethvin> which could then go to the front of the row
[13:35:28] <timmywil> i like the filename for other projects at least
[13:35:40] <rwaldron> I'm looking at ways this jQuery.events() thing might work and everything I see looks like a nightmare
[13:36:06] <timmywil> rwaldron: I don't really care about a public $.events(). I just want to be able to see events.
[13:36:15] <DaveMethvin> i think it should work like jQuery._data("events") and we let people know it's only good for debugging
[13:36:24] <rwaldron> what do you need to see about them?
[13:36:46] <DaveMethvin> debugging
[13:37:22] <rwaldron> In all of the client applications I've developed at Bocoup, this is oddly not a thing that comes up...
[13:37:23] <timmywil> I've only ever used it to look at which events are currently bound to an element during debugging. I don't use it in real code.
[13:37:45] <timmywil> but it has been useful
[13:39:07] <rwaldron> It would be nice to block writability
[13:39:38] <rwaldron> you can look, but you cant touch
[13:40:52] <timmywil> agreed
[13:43:33] <m_gol> well, you can block writability in 2.x if you want
[13:44:56] <m_gol> DaveMethvin, question: you wrapped lots of manipulation unit tests in checks for jQuery.fn.wrap or sth similar but I don't see the same defensive testing applied to other custom modules
[13:45:14] <m_gol> shouldn't it be consistent?
[13:45:29] <DaveMethvin> m_gol some of them do, but yeah i made a comment in the commit that not all of them have those guards
[13:46:02] <m_gol> besides, wouldn't it be better to move them to test/unit/wrap.js instead?
[13:46:28] <DaveMethvin> yeah they could (and probably should) be moved
[13:46:35] <DaveMethvin> but they'd still need to have a guard around htem
[13:46:47] <DaveMethvin> you could cheat and just use .wrap() for everything
[13:46:54] <m_gol> are all those different guards needed, though?
[13:47:01] <m_gol> yeah, that's what I meant to say ;)
[13:47:26] <rwaldron> m_gol yeah, but then 2.x would have different observable behaviour from 1.x and it would break the conditional comment contract :(
[13:47:26] <DaveMethvin> i figured i'd do it that way since the feature detect was for the method the test was using
[13:47:43] <DaveMethvin> the only one that we decided to punt on for unit tests was the faux-Sizzle because it was just everywhere
[13:47:53] <DaveMethvin> the others shoudl be fixed at some point
[13:48:00] <DaveMethvin> i thought we were getting them as we went
[13:48:03] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: thoughts on http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13393 ?
[13:48:19] <m_gol> rwaldron: yeah, I imagine those bug reports about "weird behavior"...
[13:48:24] <timmywil> err, when I'm not interrupting
[13:48:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah timmywil that one is the same problem with activeElement being death
[13:49:19] <DaveMethvin> i was thinking that since we're actually trying to focus the element in that case, maybe document.focus() isn't as crazy
[13:49:22] <timmywil> any solution you'd like to pursue?
[13:49:36] <timmywil> ah, that makes sense
[13:49:39] <m_gol> surely someone is modifying $._data(elem, "events") in the wild :D
[13:49:45] <rwaldron> m_gol ugh no kidding...
[13:50:09] <DaveMethvin> well if we said it's read-only for debugging then they won't be doing it in 2.0 anymore
[13:50:10] <DaveMethvin> :D
[13:50:31] <timmywil> If they file a bug, we'll close it notabug
[13:50:31] <rwaldron> hm
[13:50:51] <rwaldron> could we actually give a bogus "copy" of the events data in 1.x?
[13:51:11] <DaveMethvin> lol rwaldron you're way too paranoid
[13:51:13] <rwaldron> change it all you want... it doesnt do anything!
[13:51:21] <rwaldron> ok, dog walktime
[13:51:34] <timmywil> I actually thought of that. didn't think it was worth the space.
[13:51:58] <rwaldron> not at all
[13:52:20] <rwaldron> copying the properties and arrays is easy
[13:52:31] <rwaldron> copying the handlers, not so much
[13:52:32] <m_gol> hm
[13:52:40] <timmywil> no, i mean, I bet it's a one-liner, but still
[13:52:59] <m_gol> since jQuery wraps addEventListener and at least Chrome have the debug `monitorEvents` API (not available to web pages)...
[13:53:17] <timmywil> err, maybe you're thinking the return value of $._data. I'm thinking of how $.events would have been implemented.
[13:53:25] <m_gol> but OK, it's hard to monitor jQuery custom events this way, e.g. mouseenter etc.
[13:53:35] <rwaldron> timmywil naw, the handlers are all refs
[13:53:46] <rwaldron> we'd have to wrap them or something insane
[13:54:21] <DaveMethvin> anything that is convoluted is a non-starter ... let's just tell people they're poopy-heads if they try to change that stuff
[13:54:32] <DaveMethvin> NOBODY likes being called a poopy-head
[13:54:39] <timmywil> rwaldron: so a deep clone would still affect the original object?
[13:54:51] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: +1
[13:54:53] <DaveMethvin> gotta run for a few, be back
[13:55:19] <rwaldron> timmy, we dont do anything special for functions do we?
[13:55:22] <rwaldron> ok, brb
[13:55:46] <m_gol> a deep clone of events data seems... um... wrong
[13:55:50] <m_gol> but maybe it's just me
[13:56:21] <timmywil> m_gol: isn't that better than returning the actual events object?
[13:56:36] <timmywil> not that I"m saying we should do it
[13:57:36] <timmywil> even if the handler property of the event was changed, or, as is probably more common, an event is added to or removed from the object, events data would remain unaffected
[13:58:19] <timmywil> although honestly, I'd would roll my eyes if I saw that code and say, we don't support that
[13:58:59] <m_gol> ok, but handlers are still refs, even on deep copy
[13:59:27] <m_gol> so it's not exactly read only
[14:01:39] <timmywil> you mean the references to methods? how would you change what was referenced?
[14:03:25] <m_gol> yes
[14:04:21] <m_gol> handlers can have fields like other objects
[14:04:40] <m_gol> they can influence function body and they can be changed
[14:05:07] <m_gol> but, oh boy, I wouldn't like to meet sb programming like that :D
[14:05:52] <timmywil> yea, ok
[14:34:47] <DaveMethvin> timmywil i had a thought on that focus() event issue
[14:34:56] <timmywil> look out!
[14:35:01] <DaveMethvin> soooo
[14:35:20] <DaveMethvin> if we document.focus() it will fire any user handlers
[14:35:22] <DaveMethvin> which is bad
[14:35:37] <DaveMethvin> i am wondering whether we could do this:
[14:36:00] <DaveMethvin> try/catch on the check for activeElement and if it fails just run the handlers
[14:36:11] <DaveMethvin> that is, don't try to focus the field
[14:36:49] <DaveMethvin> was there a repro case on that ticket? lemme look
[14:37:04] <timmywil> I believe there was
[14:39:01] <DaveMethvin> doesn't break in ie10, lemme check ie9
[14:39:40] <DaveMethvin> yep
[14:39:42] <DaveMethvin> ok
[14:39:56] <DaveMethvin> timmywil i can grab this if you want
[14:40:10] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: sure, sounds good
[14:40:22] <DaveMethvin> so is everything else wrapped up for  you timmywil?
[14:41:20] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15mzgol opened pull request #1236: Fix #13741. Make wrap/unwrap methods optional. (061.x-master...061.x-13741-wrap)  02http://git.io/YPn0iA
[14:41:33] <timmywil> I didn't get to tabIndex yet, but I think orkel just needs to adjust his pull. I'll probably need to do something for 1.10. However, I think it will be a small enough change it could go in after beta.
[14:41:42] <m_gol> here you are, DaveMethvin, wrap separated on 1.x-master
[14:41:49] <DaveMethvin> ok thanks m_gol
[14:42:02] <DaveMethvin> timmywil yeah i think we'll need to leave that one
[14:42:12] <m_gol> I'll report a separate one for 2.0 creating test/unit/wrap.js in a moment
[14:42:54] <m_gol> (also, the 1.x-boxModel one can be merged, I guess, I fixed unit tests)
[14:43:01] <m_gol> (hmm, I guess I've already said that)
[14:43:10] <timmywil> I'll get rid of the firefox warnings too, but that won't change real code
[14:43:28] <DaveMethvin> by the time i get all this cleanup done and run tests locally (thanks for nothing swarmy!) it will be late tonight so I don't want to make the pile TOO high :)
[14:44:10] <timmywil> I'll try to be around after dinner tonight. Maybe you can throw stuff at me
[14:44:21] <DaveMethvin> k thanks!
[14:44:35] <timmywil> heading home. bbl
[15:01:25] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15mzgol opened pull request #1237: Separate test/unit/wrap.js; make tests not fail when wrap module excluded (06master...06test-unit-wrap)  02http://git.io/M7wBJA
[15:01:45] <m_gol> ok, wrap separation for 2.x done
[15:01:52] <DaveMethvin> thanks m_gol!
[15:05:31] <m_gol> btw, in unit/effects there's `if ( !jQuery.fx ) return`, in unit/dimensions everything is wrapped in `if ( jQuery.fn.width )`, which is preferred? some consistency should be kept here IMHO
[15:06:06] <DaveMethvin> if we're going to do a single detect the return is fine with me
[15:06:09] <DaveMethvin> saves indenting
[15:06:16] <m_gol> well, not really
[15:06:22] <m_gol> you have to have a function to return from
[15:06:40] <m_gol> therefore unit/effects.js is wrapped in IIFE
[15:06:49] <DaveMethvin> oh true
[15:06:59] <m_gol> though code is not indented so it might not be visible at first sight
[15:07:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah i debated that since the diffs get all messed up
[15:07:38] <m_gol> dunno, wrapping in if seems less convoluted than IIFE only for a single return at the beginning...
[15:07:56] <m_gol> now that I look at it
[15:08:05] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[15:08:40] <m_gol> ok, I'll update pull requests, I can change it everywhere in one commit
[15:10:57] <m_gol> what's the unit/deprecated for? it's an empty module
[15:11:16] <DaveMethvin> The unit tests for deprecated stuff should be there
[15:11:22] <DaveMethvin> but we prolly don't have any for size()
[15:11:35] <m_gol> ah, yeah, there is one in core, I can move it
[15:16:14] <m_gol> ah, but manipulation has helper functions defined, hence the IIFE
[15:16:17] <m_gol> ok, it makes sense ;)
[15:18:56] <m_gol> I added some minor changes to the master wrap pr
[15:40:18] <m_gol> oh, well, found 2 unit tests doing nothing :D
[15:46:46] <m_gol> both wrapping pull requests finalized
[15:59:21] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: if you have any comments to my PRs, I'll look into it tomorrow. It's already 1 a.m. here! ;)
[17:17:50] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I'm around
[17:18:14] <DaveMethvin> cool thanks timmywil ... now i just need to get all this stuff landed

[17:52:48] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I just commented. I've been reading the spec a few times and I vote we return -1 for elements that do not have a tabIndex attribute and are not focusable.
[17:53:09] <timmywil> he's pretty close, just need to change the other return value
[17:53:18] <DaveMethvin> well if you have read the tea leaves i can't argue with you :)
[17:53:36] <DaveMethvin> do you have a sec to fix that one and land it?
[17:53:44] <timmywil> sure
[18:19:23] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: you think we should add menuitem to rfocusable? http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/editing.html#attr-tabindex
[18:20:10] <DaveMethvin> timmywil yeah looks like it doesn't it
[18:20:47] <timmywil> I imagine it's not too common, but perhaps it wouldn't hurt
[18:21:07] <DaveMethvin> we haven't gotten a bug report ... yet
[18:28:30] <timmywil> ok, I might leave that one. Chrome inaccurately reports -1 for menuitem
[18:28:45] <timmywil> browsers may not be ready for that one :P

[20:25:57] <DaveMethvin> timmywil yeah since it's so late i'm going to do the release and blog post tomorrow am
[20:26:06] <DaveMethvin> but i think we're in good shape now

[20:26:41] <timmywil> <3
[20:26:51] <timmywil> have a good night then
[20:26:58] <DaveMethvin> you too
[21:21:57] <JamesMGreene> Anyone know how quickly airfare reimbursements usually get processed for jQuery Foundation stuff (e.g. jQCon)?
[21:22:17] <JamesMGreene> rworth ^
[21:43:33] <SlexAxton> JamesMGreene: not terribly quickly unless you have an issue
[21:44:05] <SlexAxton> after the conf isn't uncommon (for any conference)
[21:44:15] <JamesMGreene> SlexAxton: Any date/week estimate to go with that vague answer? :)
[21:44:22] <SlexAxton> nope
[21:44:26] <JamesMGreene> lol, k
[21:44:29] <SlexAxton> a little bit after the conference
[21:44:32] <SlexAxton> at the latest
[21:44:35] <SlexAxton> sometimes before
[21:44:44] <SlexAxton> the jQuery money is a little more locked up than other conferences
[21:44:47] <SlexAxton> due to the foundation
[21:44:49] <SlexAxton> etc
[21:44:51] <JamesMGreene> Total side question for you, SlexAxton
[21:44:55] <SlexAxton> aka following the law
[21:44:56] <SlexAxton> et
[21:44:57] <SlexAxton> c
[21:45:33] <JamesMGreene> Any good examples of internationalization/globalization/localization when using JS templating libraries, e.g. Lo-Dash?
[21:45:50] <SlexAxton> only one tiny one that i put up
[21:45:51] <SlexAxton> one sec
[21:47:07] <SlexAxton> if you check out this project i put up
[21:47:12] <SlexAxton> this is an internal thing i tried and like
[21:47:14] <SlexAxton> https://github.com/jedtoolkit/messageform.at/blob/master/dev/template/create.hbs#L1
[21:47:32] <SlexAxton> note the {{#_ "key" data}}english translation{{/_}}
[21:47:53] <SlexAxton> if you follow that back through the modified require-handlebars-plugin that i have there
[21:47:58] <SlexAxton> it all can be quite nice
[21:48:08] <SlexAxton> just switch things out and the templates get compiled to your language nicely
[21:48:25] <SlexAxton> the more naive version of that is in the require-handlebars-plugin repo
[21:52:23] <SlexAxton> gotta run :d
[22:00:56] <JamesMGreene> thanks, SlexAxton
