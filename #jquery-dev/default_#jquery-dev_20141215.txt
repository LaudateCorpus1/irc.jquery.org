[11:45:53] <DaveMethvin> timmywil gibson042 looks like we're getting fails on the latest sizzle changes http://swarm.jquery.org/job/3999
[11:46:00] <DaveMethvin> not sure why the bot didn't announce it
[11:46:37] <timmywil> uhoh!
[11:47:11] <timmywil> oh, we broke that on purpose didn't we
[11:47:41] <timmywil> err, no
[11:47:46] <timmywil> ok, I'm confused
[11:48:35] <DaveMethvin> is that a valid selector without quotes?
[11:48:38] <DaveMethvin> p a[href^=#]
[11:48:51] <timmywil> It's not
[11:48:53] <timmywil> technically
[11:48:58] <DaveMethvin> i think we may have tightened that up ... but really we don't want that in a patch release
[11:49:03] <timmywil> yea
[11:49:30] <timmywil> this may be one of those 2.0 changes
[11:49:35] <timmywil> Sizzle 2.0 that is
[11:50:07] <DaveMethvin> just looking at what landed
[11:50:25] <DaveMethvin> and hoping it's not the safari patch :)
[11:52:28] <DaveMethvin> it's likely that at least one of the sizzle 2.x patches changed behavior, we need a branch past 1.10 that just captures the bug and memory leak fixes
[11:55:24] <m_gol> gibson042 reverted one breaking change in 2.0.0 from 2.1.0
[11:55:49] <m_gol> I agree it would be better to follow versioning and just patch 1.10
[11:55:58] <m_gol> it cannot be published to npm because of a previous package
[11:56:06] <m_gol> but we get Sizzle 1.10 from Bower anyway
[11:56:18] <m_gol> DaveMethvin timmywil ^^^
[11:56:27] <DaveMethvin> not anymore we don't ... oh yeah we do for this one
[11:56:38] <DaveMethvin> so confusing
[11:57:15] <timmywil> so, this is just for 1.11-stable?
[11:57:25] <timmywil> we don't need to change them all, right?
[11:57:35] <m_gol> 1.11-stable & 2.1-stable
[11:57:49] <timmywil> but not compat/master
[11:57:56] <m_gol> right
[11:58:10] <timmywil> ok
[12:01:22] <m_gol> I hope it's not problematic too much to not publich Sizzle 1.10.* patch to npm
[12:01:27] <m_gol> * publish
[12:01:56] <timmywil> it's not, but it will be available in bower
[12:02:11] <m_gol> sure, that's OK :)
[12:04:26] <timmywil> ok, I'm not actually sure what to do. Am I just adding this commit? https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/commit/24d41a5d6cfa0b7af78a25b6282597cf76732e36
[12:05:36] <DaveMethvin> you mean, adding to the old 1.10? There were a couple of important memory  leak fixes as well
[12:05:52] <timmywil> ok, there's the unload handler commit
[12:06:15] <DaveMethvin> I'm just not sure what is breaking it
[12:06:23] <timmywil> gibson042 did not include this one (https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/commit/8a2e0f6e430bb8663f8a0aff8252f961740ad566) in the latest release
[12:06:50] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[12:07:11] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: the breaking change is pretty old
[12:07:24] <timmywil> there have been lots of changes since then
[12:07:44] <DaveMethvin> how major is the change? Can it be backed out easily?
[12:07:58] <DaveMethvin> i think you're saying "no" :)
[12:08:36] <timmywil> well, I was thinking we'd tack on the critical stuff to the old Sizzle in -stable branches
[12:09:01] <timmywil> so, I could cherry-pick whatever commits we needed and make a new Sizzle 1.x tag
[12:09:10] <m_gol> the one used in jQuery 2.1.1 is 1.10.19
[12:09:13] <timmywil> or, we could back out the change on master and make a new 2.x tag
[12:09:40] <DaveMethvin> for the moment the big issue is the 1.11-stable and 2.1-stable branches
[12:09:53] <DaveMethvin> the others can wait and breakage there may be justified
[12:10:01] <m_gol> gibson042 went for the second approach but the former is safer
[12:10:19] <DaveMethvin> i think we should have sizzle 1.10 plus minimal bug and memory leak fixes
[12:10:32] <DaveMethvin> but no breaking changes since this is a minor jquery rel
[12:10:33] <m_gol> for jQuery I just branched with 2.1-stable & 1.11-stable at the last commits that didn't introduce breaking changes
[12:10:45] <m_gol> and cherry-picked a few minor non-breaking newer commits
[12:11:12] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: even s/minor/patch/
[12:11:16] <timmywil> the most important commit is the Safari fix tho, right?
[12:11:51] <DaveMethvin> yes but there were some memory leaks that would be good to pick in there and relatively low risk
[12:12:04] <DaveMethvin> the ones nulling out the context
[12:12:40] <timmywil> ok, but it's confusing because gibson042 didn't include one of those leak fixes in 2.1.1
[12:12:58] <DaveMethvin> we should check with him on why
[12:13:09] <DaveMethvin> i have to do the blog post any so i'm not ready to go
[12:13:14] <DaveMethvin> working on that now
[12:25:01] <timmywil> ok, the breaking commit is two commits after the 1.10.19 release
[12:25:15] <DaveMethvin> ugh, go figure
[12:25:24] <timmywil> the code is different enough that cherry-picking the new commits isn't pretty
[12:26:15] <timmywil> it would be easiest to just make a new 2.x and revert the break
[12:26:59] <timmywil> I believe that's the only breaking change
[12:27:11] <DaveMethvin> could you branch before the 2.x and revert it there? it just seems like this release should be sizzle 1.x
[12:27:37] <timmywil> the only reason we made 2.x was because we took over the npm package
[12:27:54] <DaveMethvin> oh geez
[12:28:21] <DaveMethvin> well then it sounds like we'd use sizzle 3.0 for jquery 3.0 right?
[12:28:34] <DaveMethvin> since we have to release a 2.x and then reapply the breaking change
[12:28:47] <timmywil> ah, I see your point now
[12:28:54] <DaveMethvin> which works, no problem
[12:29:00] <timmywil> yea, I'm ok with that
[12:29:07] <DaveMethvin> we can use bigger numbers :)
[12:29:17] <timmywil> like Chrome!
[12:29:23] <timmywil> jQuery 53
[12:29:27] <DaveMethvin> hey let's not go crazy!!!!
[12:29:32] <DaveMethvin> :)
[13:47:14] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: For automated CLA checks, do we just want a commit status or do we want a bot to actually write a comment?
[13:47:20] <scott_gonzalez> I think just commit status would be good.
[13:51:36] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: agreed
[13:56:18] <gibson042> argh, I just came back to see all of this but have to be AFK until later tonight
[13:56:50] <DaveMethvin> no prob gibson042
[13:56:57] <gibson042> https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/compare/2.0.0...2.1-stable is your friend, though
[13:57:36] <gibson042> I'll be back later
