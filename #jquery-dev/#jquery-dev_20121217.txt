[09:30:10] <shoky> ah thanks scott_gonzalez. i was looking in bugs.jquery.com
[09:31:08] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: the readme points to bugs.jquery, should I be filing something there, or use issues?
[09:31:34] <nacin> eh. will just file a PR.
[09:31:39] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Use GitHub Issues. This was literally just discussed in the core meeting, so DaveMethvin hasn't updated the blog yet.
[09:31:59] <DaveMethvin> don't post anything, i'll update the blog
[09:32:02] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: sounds good.
[09:34:05] <nacin> DaveMethvin: 1.9 b1 is already soaking in WordPress trunk.
[09:34:13] <DaveMethvin> aahhhh
[09:35:04] <nacin> so should give you a few thousand additional passive testers. we'll fix our warnings and report any issues upstream.
[09:40:48] <scott_gonzalez> In case everyone already left the meeting...
[09:40:56] <scott_gonzalez> The thing I wanted to discuss was our style guide.

[10:17:07] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: sry I missed the meeting
[10:17:07] <b-ot> timmywil, you have one new message, say ‚Äúread‚Äù to me when you wish to read it.
[10:17:07] <bot-t> (41 hours 20 mins ago) <gibson042> tell timmywil in practical terms, switching between documents is so rare that I have a hard time imagining it being worth the size increase. one reason I like a `setDocument` at init time is that it'll almost always be the *only* such call
[10:17:15] <timmywil> b-ot: read
[10:17:15] <b-ot> timmywil, from gibson042, 1d 17h ago: in practical terms, switching between documents is so rare that I have a hard time imagining it being worth the size increase. one reason I like a `setDocument` at init time is that it'll almost always be the *only* such call
[10:18:15] <timmywil> agreed, but I still think setDocument is the right direction
[10:18:29] <gibson042> I think so too
[10:18:55] <timmywil> gibson042: have you seen :lang?
[10:19:08] <timmywil> I went ahead and did it right after asking who should do it :P
[10:19:18] <gibson042> no, but I'll check it out later
[10:19:20] <gibson042> cool :)
[10:30:46] <timmywil> updated Sizzle docs for new selectors : https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/wiki/Sizzle-Documentation
[10:33:35] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: Sizzle support could simply fix QSA bugs and only supply fallbacks for broken codepaths. However, support for selector extensions (especially POS selectors) could get even messier. Also, considering Sizzle is a separate project with broader browser support, I'm leaning towards saying 2.0 won't see a lot of Sizzle changes.
[10:34:03] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: that's fine, just wanted to see if it would help
[10:34:48] <DaveMethvin> also, it would be good to have an alternate-Sizzle module that was essentially a passthru to qSA as an alternative for people willing to use CSS3 selectors only and deal with those quirks
[10:34:51] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: we could think about supplying a version of jQuery that has selector alternatives
[10:35:02] <timmywil> exaclty
[10:35:27] <DaveMethvin> not exactly sure how we'd package that but we can work it out later
[10:35:51] <DaveMethvin> probably just a custom build with some modules being optional unless you explicitly include them
[10:35:55] <timmywil> I think I could work something out
[10:36:17] <timmywil> it would switch out selector.js
[10:36:42] <timmywil> still need jQuery.text and things like that, but jQuery.find would map to a simple engine
[10:36:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it could probably be pretty tiny
[10:37:46] <timmywil> will be fun to try
[10:37:57] <DaveMethvin> for some definition of "fun" :D
[10:38:19] <timmywil> we're nerds :)
[10:38:25] <DaveMethvin> it's kind of nice b/c you can say, "hey that's just how qSA works sorry"

[11:53:22] <DaveMethvin> nacin: so are you using the jquery-migrate-git.js now with your fix for noConflict?
[11:54:06] <DaveMethvin> just trying to decide whether it would be worth updating the beta file there since a lot of people may be using it and it has a couple of problems
[11:58:06] <nacin> DaveMethvin: I just did s/$/jQuery/ on commit to WP core.
[11:58:27] <DaveMethvin> damn, you're practical nacin :D
[11:59:07] <DaveMethvin> there's one other bug with .toggle() that people have run into
[11:59:37] <nacin> DaveMethvin: :) I figured I'd just follow your lead. Any changes to either and we'll update. We don't need to stick with the .0's of either.
[11:59:48] <DaveMethvin> s/jQuery.event.toggle/jQuery.fn.toggle/ will fix it in the file
[12:00:38] <nacin> oldToggle = jQuery.fn.toggle?
[12:01:44] <DaveMethvin> right nacin
[12:02:27] <nacin> sure, making that change.

[12:07:40] <timmywil> lang can be anything as long as it's a valid identifier
[12:07:47] <nacin> DaveMethvin: hah, so, three people already reported that change to us already anyway. as I said, this should give you some testers. :)
[12:08:17] <timmywil> empty string shortcut doesn't cut it

[12:33:52] <Krinkle> Interesting.. https://gist.github.com/4321927
[12:34:10] <Krinkle> saucelabs uses selenium, that's sort of unrelated but it means we can look in the dom.

[12:47:39] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: We can also get videos/screenshots using saucelabs.
[12:48:04] <Krinkle> sure, but if we need that we can just use the GUI in either sl/bs
[12:48:14] <Krinkle> but its a nice feature
[12:48:42] <Krinkle> but taping 1000s of tests, which only show the swarm run page is not very useful I guess :P - and we aggregate the qunit DOM already
