[08:01:05] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: We have a usability problem with the new CLA form :-/
[08:01:59] <scott_gonzalez> Now that we removed all the contact fields, the confirmation field immediately follows the email field.
[08:02:31] <scott_gonzalez> This is resulting in form autofill seeing the confirmation field as an email confirmation field and autofilling it.

[08:33:28] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez i guess the solution is to change its name? 
[08:34:16] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=265252
[08:34:27] <mikesherov> looks like Chrome is actually nailing these bugs
[08:34:43] <mikesherov> good to see some more traction that Blink is rocking and rolling
[08:34:48] <DaveMethvin> omg that's a good one!
[08:35:59] <mikesherov> yeah
[08:36:39] <DaveMethvin> of course we need to stop truncating height/width too :)
[08:38:04] <mikesherov> I'll get to that in a few minutâ€¦. oh wait, babies are crying
[08:38:12] <DaveMethvin> lol
[08:56:58] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I can test it out and make sure that it won't break the spreadsheet.
[08:57:10] <DaveMethvin> I think it adds a new column scott_gonzalez
[08:57:20] <DaveMethvin> not sure if  you can rename in the ss
[08:57:30] <DaveMethvin> actually that might work
[08:57:37] <DaveMethvin> you could rename in the ss, then change the form
[08:57:50] <scott_gonzalez> I'll make a test form first.
[08:57:55] <DaveMethvin> yeah :)
