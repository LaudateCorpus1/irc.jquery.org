[02:47:08] <m_gol> jzaefferer: did I remove anything? I though I just added two lines.

[06:24:12] <jzaefferer> m_gol: I've updated the job once more and started a new build, that's correctly marked as unstable now
[06:29:47] <jzaefferer> m_gol: btw. https://github.com/jzaefferer/grunt-check-modules - I started that exactly a year before your grunt-check-dependencies repo, based on the first commit. I guess yours does a few things more, still odd to have so much overlap, even in the name
