[09:37:16] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I think I have something usable at this point. The remaining work concerns publishing to the CDNs.
[09:37:16] <b-ot> timmywil: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[09:37:22] <timmywil> `read
[09:37:22] <b-ot> timmywil: From scott_gonzalez, 17h 36m ago: It supports beta releases, but I wouldn't suggest using it right now as it's known to be buggy (based on the Mobile release).
[09:37:42] <DaveMethvin> timmywil what needs to be done on the CDNs?
[09:38:12] <timmywil> it seems to be expecting cdn files to be copied to a cdn folder within the dist folder
[09:38:36] <timmywil> and it doesn't handle Google/Microsoft file creations
[09:38:42] <DaveMethvin> CORE LIVES ON THE ROOT, WE DON'T NEED NO STEENKIN FOLDER
[09:38:57] <DaveMethvin> for beta we don't need the google/ms stuff anyway
[09:39:10] <timmywil> it doesn't do npm publish either, but that's easy to do without a script
[09:39:36] <timmywil> and we haven't done it in a script anyway
[09:39:58] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: ah, right. Well good then!
[09:40:12] <timmywil> I'm not far then.
[09:40:24] <timmywil> I got bower.json updates working
[09:40:42] <DaveMethvin> Do you want to run the script then ferreals when you're ready? I still have to do some stuff for the blog post but since it's a beta it wouldn't hurt to push it up
[09:41:10] <timmywil> sure, I can handle that :)
[09:54:34] <DaveMethvin> timmywil since we have a combined 1.12/2.2 milestone in the tracker i suspect the script won't get the changelog right ... should I go ahead and do that manually?
[09:55:31] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: hmm, we could change the SQL
[09:56:03] <DaveMethvin> oh like a "contains"?
[09:56:11] <DaveMethvin> hmm
[09:56:12] <timmywil> yea
[09:56:16] <timmywil> http://bugs.jquery.com/report/508?action=edit
[09:58:15] <DaveMethvin> i was pulling the contributor list from the authors of the commits over on github using git shortlog -nse
[10:03:08] <jqcommit> 01[13jquery-release01] 15timmywil pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/QhJu0w
[10:03:08] <jqcommit> 13jquery-release/06master 14dde82aa 15Timmy Willison: CDN: Allow the cdn source folder to be configurable
[10:05:25] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: You *could* override _generateTracChangelog() in the core release script.
[10:05:49] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: good it's not git shortlog -nsa
[10:06:30] <DaveMethvin> they already have the log!
[10:06:42] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: I think the SQL needs to be different regardless.
[10:07:38] <timmywil> but thank you. that's good for me to keep in mind
[10:08:18] <scott_gonzalez> It's just doing a standard Trac query, not an SQL query.
[10:09:18] <DaveMethvin> yeah if we kept that we couldn't get the combined versoin afaict since it's not an exact match
[10:09:19] <timmywil> ?
[10:09:40] <timmywil> A trac query is an sql query
[10:09:41] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jquery.com/query?milestone=1.11/2.1&resolution=fixed&col=id&col=component&col=summary&order=component
[10:09:55] <scott_gonzalez> Trac supports two types of queries: Trac queries and SQL queries.
[10:09:59] <DaveMethvin> so we want to look for tickets with milestone 1.12 or 1.12/2.2 when we generate the changelog for 1.12
[10:10:06] <scott_gonzalez> I realize a Trac query gets converted to an SQL query internally.
[10:10:10] <scott_gonzalez> But they are actually different.
[10:10:16] <scott_gonzalez> And you can't do an SQL query via a URL.
[10:10:21] <timmywil> Ok, I see
[10:10:40] <scott_gonzalez> The only way to use an SQL query is to create a stored report.
[10:10:50] <DaveMethvin> but we could create a query that used a stored report with a "contains" I suspect?
[10:11:15] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but then all Trac installs (ok, just the two) would have to have the same number for the report.
[10:11:21] <scott_gonzalez> Trac queries are cleaner.
[10:11:45] <scott_gonzalez> Or we could have a property for the report id.
[10:11:55] <timmywil> we already have a report id property
[10:11:56] <scott_gonzalez> But even then, it wouldn't work.
[10:12:22] <scott_gonzalez> Oh yeah, for contributors, right?
[10:12:26] <scott_gonzalez> Because that has to use SQL.
[10:12:36] <scott_gonzalez> It's not possible generate the query we want without that.
[10:12:37] <timmywil> right, yea, I'm confusing the two
[10:12:45] <DaveMethvin> do you use trac data for that? i was using git
[10:13:00] <scott_gonzalez> But the point is even using a report id for changelog wouldn't help.
[10:13:32] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you fix the version numbers in Trac.
[10:13:48] <scott_gonzalez> It should be 1.11.0/2.1.0 instead of 1.11/2.1
[10:13:58] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I was leading you astray. I'll customize the changelog method.
[10:14:19] <DaveMethvin> ok, no problem
[10:14:26] <timmywil> does editing the milestone name edit the tickets as well?
[10:14:38] <scott_gonzalez> nope :-/
[10:14:47] <timmywil> blar
[10:14:49] <DaveMethvin> bulk update would fix it
[10:15:05] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, get ready for lots of email :-P
[10:15:13] <DaveMethvin> not in a bulk update
[10:15:33] <scott_gonzalez> Pretty sure bulk updates send emails.
[10:15:40] <timmywil> It's ok, I think it would be simple enough to do a Trac query instead
[10:15:59] <timmywil> I was thinking of the contributors query before
[10:16:28] <timmywil> which probably still needs to be a contains
[10:16:31] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: So we can tackle both of these queries together.
[10:16:54] <scott_gonzalez> What if we just add a new method _tracMilestone() { return Release.newVersion; }
[10:17:02] <scott_gonzalez> And you override that in core's release script.
[10:17:28] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: good idea!
[10:17:37] <scott_gonzalez> Want to test that locally and send a PR?
[10:17:42] <timmywil> sure
[10:18:39] <scott_gonzalez> You might be able to borrow some of the version logic from https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/blob/master/lib/repo.js#L116-L134 to help generate the dual milestone.
[10:19:10] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well, I guess the logic is actually really simple since the versions track each other.
[10:19:22] <scott_gonzalez> It's just major-1.minor-10.patch, right?
[10:19:41] <scott_gonzalez> errr. major-1.minor+10.patch or major+1.minor-10.patch
[10:42:56] <m_gol> we should use git for the contributors list
[10:43:05] <m_gol> not every pull request had to have an associated issue
[10:44:04] <DaveMethvin> also we tend to be more strict about  names in the git log than on trac
[10:47:32] <scott_gonzalez> The contributor list is all git authors + all Trac reporters + commenters.
[10:49:24] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, timmywil here's the report we use for UI: https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/8059481
[10:49:38] <m_gol> not sure about commenters
[10:49:41] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to update it to include duplicates, but I haven't figured out that query.
[10:49:56] <m_gol> should we add people saying "why y no fix it?!" to contributors?
[10:50:17] <scott_gonzalez> No, but should you leave out the people who really help via comments just to avoid the douchebags?
[10:50:47] <DaveMethvin> http://blog.jquery.com/?p=3173&preview=true&preview_id=3173&public=1&nonce=a843e23094
[10:50:47] <scott_gonzalez> I'd rather thank someone that was being stupid than not thank someone that genuinely helped.
[10:51:02] <DaveMethvin> need to check the links (e.g, are we changing to beta.3 now?
[10:51:13] <DaveMethvin> and also add the changelogs)
[10:51:33] <m_gol> I wonder how long is the list of commenters that weren't reporters anyway
[10:51:44] <m_gol> maybe it's possible to manually check their contributions
[10:52:07] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: I don't think anyone expects commenters to be added to the list of contributors.
[10:52:59] <timmywil> but I guess I don't mind
[10:53:19] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: the line `jQuery = $ = require("jquery")` seems like you wanted to create implicit globals ;)
[10:53:47] <m_gol> maybe `var jQuery = require("jquery"), $ = jQuery`?
[10:53:49] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the report is per project, so you can opt to leave them out in your report.
[10:54:25] <DaveMethvin> m_gol that was in case someone did want to do that, since we don't anymore
[10:54:39] <DaveMethvin> if they want locals they can add var
[10:54:59] <m_gol> I know, I was mostly saying that *implicit* globals are bad
[10:55:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah they are!
[10:55:11] <DaveMethvin> :)
[10:55:17] <m_gol> so maybe `window.jQuery = window.$ = require("jquery")`
[10:55:29] <m_gol> (and they don't work in strict mode so there's also that)
[10:55:55] <DaveMethvin> that is probalby what the browserify guys would do so let me use that
[10:58:19] <m_gol> that's better, thx :)
[10:58:54] <m_gol> lol, just got to the release notes section :D
[11:00:16] <DaveMethvin> you can count on me for corny
[11:00:47] <m_gol> :)
[11:03:09] <timmywil> I love the release notes
[11:03:49] <DaveMethvin> we need contributors whose names rhyme better

[12:25:25] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: Please use PRs for jquery-release.
[12:26:21] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: oh, ok sorry.
[12:28:23] <scott_gonzalez> I really want to keep configuration as small as possible. I intentionally avoided doing this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/commit/dde82aa042693ba2ded345abdf4418ed06da1cc1
[12:28:32] <scott_gonzalez> And we don't use path.join()
[12:31:37] <timmywil> Well, I don't mind reverting that, but I don't agree with either point.
[12:32:38] <scott_gonzalez> The more configuration there is, the harder it is to maintain, and the less in-sync our projects actually are.
[12:32:53] <scott_gonzalez> And path.join() doesn't actually do antyhing useful.
[12:33:00] <scott_gonzalez> Slash direction doesn't matter.
[12:33:40] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/commit/77f8a2ccc9a093a993951337177d5b903ff28587 seems to introduce lots of unused abstraction.
[12:34:10] <timmywil> which parts aren't used?
[12:34:12] <scott_gonzalez> readBower(), writeBower(), and versionPackage()
[12:34:26] <scott_gonzalez> So basically the entire set of abstraction here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/commit/77f8a2ccc9a093a993951337177d5b903ff28587#diff-204a8ee771be2016e4c9ba1b122632dfR218
[12:35:04] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I see versionPackage() is actually used in an abstract way.
[12:35:21] <scott_gonzalez> Which kind of defeats the purpose of abstracting the method.
[12:36:00] <timmywil> read/writeBower were created to follow the package.json read/write convention already present. They are there for repos to do their own handling of bower (since core is the only one that does it right now).
[12:36:42] <scott_gonzalez> But then you avoided it by creating more abstraction.
[12:36:59] <timmywil> avoided what?
[12:37:11] <scott_gonzalez> The use of read/writeBower()
[12:37:24] <timmywil> they are there to use publicly
[12:38:59] <scott_gonzalez> Is core using them?
[12:39:17] <m_gol> path.join does do sth useful, normalizing path delimiters may be needed if you pass the generated path to a subprocess not handled by node core. but for internal use - yeah, no need
[12:41:44] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: core will be using them
[12:43:14] <scott_gonzalez> Would you mind resetting to 87f53dc19e820d6f6595a5fc0687e2d015829712 and sending a PR for other stuff so it can be discussed?
[12:44:20] <timmywil> well, I need the bower handling. Do you mind if I reset after I release?
[12:44:28] <timmywil> I suppose I could just use it locally.
[12:44:48] <scott_gonzalez> Either way is fine.
[12:44:56] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.

[13:38:00] <timmywil> gibson042: feel free
[13:38:51] <DaveMethvin> i can do those manually timmywil ... does seem like jquery-release should do that for betas tho, no?
[13:39:07] <timmywil> I would think so, scott_gonzalez ?
[13:40:17] <scott_gonzalez> It can, we just never did that for UI and the only stuff I implemented so far is from teh UI script.

[13:44:39] <timmywil> We were missing quite a few and some of the ordering was a little off
[13:44:53] <DaveMethvin> timmywil were we handling the differences for the old guys via .mailmap?
[13:45:05] <DaveMethvin> on the new ones, there are two that are not formal names
[13:45:17] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez are we still wanting/requiring first and last name?
[13:45:41] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: `grunt authors` gives you the list.
[13:45:52] <DaveMethvin> if so we should be able to get those from the CLA
[13:46:06] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Yes, as much as possible we should get first and last name.
[13:46:30] <scott_gonzalez> Any entries that are messed up with `grunt authors` need to be fixed with the mailmap.
[13:46:42] <timmywil> ah, forgot about grunt authors
[13:47:02] <timmywil> I wonder what the differences are
[13:47:26] <scott_gonzalez> Between `grunt authors` and `git log`?
[13:47:43] <timmywil> yea
[13:47:49] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think the log uses the mailmap by default.
[13:48:05] <timmywil> that makes sense

[13:50:47] <timmywil> Hmm, I was using --format. I wonder if --pretty triggers the mailmap.
[13:51:01] <scott_gonzalez> It's the tokens.
[13:51:05] <scott_gonzalez> %aN vs. %an
[13:51:18] <timmywil> I used the same tokens
[13:51:34] <timmywil> it doesn't matter, I'm just curious
[13:51:36] <scott_gonzalez> And you're getting different results?
[13:51:58] <timmywil> apparently
[13:52:06] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[13:52:26] <scott_gonzalez> `grunt authors` is very simple. It just does a log and dedupes while keeping order.
[13:57:30] <timmywil> oh, nvm, it's not different
[13:58:05] <timmywil> I don't think anyone has ever written the output directly to AUTHORS.txt
[13:58:17] <scott_gonzalez> You shouldn't.
[13:58:23] <scott_gonzalez> You should only take the bottom portion.
[13:58:35] <scott_gonzalez> Git doesn't know the full history.
[13:58:55] <scott_gonzalez> Unless John did a better import for core than he did for UI.
[13:58:56] <timmywil> in this case, it has more history
[13:59:14] <timmywil> and some ordering corrections
[13:59:43] <scott_gonzalez> The ordering corrections may not be right, is what I'm saying.
[14:00:00] <scott_gonzalez> You'll have to ask DaveMethvin where he got the original list from.
[14:00:00] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Core build #1031: STILL FAILING in 10 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core/1031/
[14:00:01] <doesallmagic2> richard.gibson: Selector: update Sizzle
[14:01:40] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: what if I just take everything from Jonathan Sampson down? https://github.com/timmywil/jquery/commit/96d3e737295df416189fee01da531b4c8abd3d8a#diff-81cc714230c9d42f9427ca91ac4d0921R164
[14:01:50] <timmywil> it's ordered by date so that should be accurate
[14:02:28] <DaveMethvin> if there is some reproducible list i'd go with that :)
[14:06:16] <timmywil> afaict, grunt authors actually has more names without removing any
[14:06:19] <scott_gonzalez> I guess it depends on whether this is the actual first commit, based on date, I'm guessing it is: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/8a4a1edf047f2c272f663866eb7b5fcd644d65b3
[14:06:39] <scott_gonzalez> Because DaveMethvin probably ripped certain names out.
[14:06:50] <scott_gonzalez> When he was trying to contact people for CLAs.
[14:06:54] <scott_gonzalez> That's my guess anyway.
[14:06:58] <DaveMethvin> not that i know of
[14:07:09] <scott_gonzalez> Oh well, do you know how you first generated the list?
[14:07:10] <DaveMethvin> it shoudl be the complete list
[14:07:16] <DaveMethvin> but i don't recall 
[14:08:15] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I've confirmed that the git history is complete.

[14:34:22] <DaveMethvin> what are ya, CHICKEN?
[14:34:56] <DaveMethvin> header looks good
[14:35:13] <timmywil> yea, I kept the same code for making the CDN copies
[14:35:32] <timmywil> jquery-release just pushes to codeorigin rather than using scp
[14:36:02] <timmywil> does codeorigin have CI for production?
[14:36:29] <timmywil> If not, that'll just need to be rolled
[14:36:31] <DaveMethvin> yeah no need to do anything else
[14:36:36] <timmywil> ok cool
[14:36:54] <DaveMethvin> much easier than the old way, i had to have keys on the production server to push

[14:46:00] <DaveMethvin> YEAAAAAH!
[14:46:09] <DaveMethvin> how did it feel timmywil
[14:46:16] <DaveMethvin> looks like the files are up now
[14:46:20] <timmywil> I need a nap :)
[14:46:55] <DaveMethvin> yeah, releasing is hard
[14:47:09] <DaveMethvin> okay, i have the blog post ready to go as well
[14:47:16] <DaveMethvin> which is good, because i have to leave in about 10 minutes
[14:47:42] <timmywil> feels good though. I like success messages.

[14:48:18] <DaveMethvin> before it gets too foggy, you might make a few notes about what needs to be changed before the next release timmywil
[14:50:30] <timmywil> for the final release, I think it's just a matter of building the Google and MS CDN archives
[14:50:38] <timmywil> The code is in there, but it's untested.
[14:51:09] <DaveMethvin> http://blog.jquery.com/2013/12/20/jquery-1-11-02-1-0-beta-3-released/
[14:51:21] <timmywil> well, this only works on my own branch, but that will change
[14:51:50] <DaveMethvin> we'll just tell paul_irish to get it from your branch
[14:51:50] <timmywil> oh, npm
[14:51:55] <timmywil> I'll add that to the list
[14:52:12] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, i mentioned that in the blog
[14:52:22] <timmywil> I can publish
[14:52:22] <DaveMethvin> since we published the last beta
[14:53:39] <timmywil> published
[14:54:02] <DaveMethvin> awesome
[14:57:45] <timmywil> oh, it looks like beta2 was published without the beta tag?
[14:57:54] <timmywil> should we do that with 3 or was that a mistake?
[14:58:28] <timmywil> DaveMethvin
[14:58:59] <DaveMethvin> it should have been tagged .... hmm
[14:59:09] <DaveMethvin> maybe it didn't get pushed, let me check
[15:00:00] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: sorry, I'm probably confusing. On npm, if packages are published without the beta tag (e.g. npm publish --tag beta), the version published becomes the latest version.
[15:00:12] <DaveMethvin> oh ok
[15:00:17] <timmywil> so npm install jquery currently installs beta2
[15:00:23] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[15:00:32] <timmywil> I can fix that
[15:00:33] <DaveMethvin> well nobody must be using it then :)
[15:00:47] <timmywil> or we can publish beta3 so it is the new latest
[15:00:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah let's do that
[15:01:05] <DaveMethvin> might as well
[15:01:09] <timmywil> ok
[15:01:12] <DaveMethvin> don't want anyone using a stale beta
[15:01:56] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: ok, done
[15:02:34] <DaveMethvin> all is right with the world
[15:02:43] <timmywil> hooray!
[15:02:55] <DaveMethvin> thanks for getting that done timmywil
[15:03:02] <DaveMethvin> wasnt' that FUN?
[15:03:05] <timmywil> my pleasure

[15:06:05] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: oh, um, I forgot to finish a small thing for the beta. There wasn't a ticket for it, but I meant to get to it.
[15:06:19] <timmywil> npm still attaches jQuery to the global :(
[15:06:56] <timmywil> the build option was added, but I forgot to limit the exposure
[15:07:58] <DaveMethvin> haha okay let me change that to say we will take it out?
[15:08:13] <timmywil> yea, good idea :/
[15:08:15] <DaveMethvin> ok

[19:37:21] <JamesMGreene> Dear jQuery friends: anyone recognize this?
[19:37:42] <JamesMGreene> Syntax error, unrecognized expression: 'nav[role="navigation"] a[href="http://mydomain.com/my-room/"]'
[19:41:49] <JamesMGreene> Doesn't happen in Chome but happens in Safari, Firefox
[19:42:36] <JamesMGreene> Chrome*
[19:43:37] <DaveMethvin> JamesMGreene that's coming from Sizzle to it thinks it's not a valid selector
[19:43:58] <DaveMethvin> s/to/so/
[19:48:53] <JamesMGreene> Knew that
[19:49:03] <JamesMGreene> Anyway, figured out the error. Thanks, though
[19:49:19] <JamesMGreene> It was actually missing the final ']'
[19:49:49] <DaveMethvin> oh
[19:50:16] <DaveMethvin> well the reason the final ] doesn't cause a bug in ie/ff is that webkit is not to spec
[19:50:19] <DaveMethvin> believe it or not
[19:50:28] <DaveMethvin> it's supposed to auto-close all those
[19:50:45] <DaveMethvin> it's a case of "the spec is an ass"
[21:01:13] <JamesMGreene> DaveMethvin: Interesting but odd... it auto-closed in Chrome but NOT in Safari, Firefox
[21:01:16] <JamesMGreene> Didn't test IE
