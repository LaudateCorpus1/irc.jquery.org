[01:25:58] <m_gol> `tell DaveMethvin I'm perfectly fine with UA-sniffing for Opera 12.x in some tests and not invoking them if handling the issues would be a problem.

[01:28:08] <m_gol> `tell DaveMethvin: and they still haven't released a Linux version, 12.1x is technically the newest Opera there (and still supported!)

[05:25:54] <DaveMethvin> m_gol are you still in amsterdam?
[05:25:58] <m_gol> yup
[05:26:10] <m_gol> I'm getting back on Thursday
[05:26:17] <DaveMethvin> can you and jaubourg take a look at the tickets in yesterday's meeting notes?
[05:26:24] <DaveMethvin> i'd like to get those into the beta
[05:26:32] <m_gol> k, will look into that
[05:26:42] <DaveMethvin> btw this prob with opera 12 is strange
[05:27:10] <DaveMethvin> it doesn't seem to like selecting elements from a child doc from js in the parent
[05:27:19] <DaveMethvin> but i am just gonna skip it
[05:27:47] <m_gol> yeah
[05:27:59] <m_gol> fine for me, not worth to spend too much time on it
[05:28:21] <m_gol> it's so crappy they're not even informing the users there is a new version available...
[05:28:29] <DaveMethvin> especially because the opera debugger is a mystery to me ... it has some really annoying features
[05:28:36] <m_gol> agreed
[05:28:45] <m_gol> e.g. its console not always corresponds to the current tab
[05:29:00] <m_gol> I always open it using "inspect element" to make sure it's on the tab I want
[05:29:18] <m_gol> also, no autosuggest in console, even IE has finally implemented that
[05:29:22] <DaveMethvin> and it seems to lose breakpoints on reload so i had to break on first execute and THEN set the bp
[05:29:28] <m_gol> o lol
[05:29:49] <m_gol> I'm kind of surprised they still plan to make their own dev tools in Blink Opera
[05:30:10] <m_gol> but at least it will be based on Chrome's so they shouldn't be so annoying ;)
[05:30:14] <DaveMethvin> s/surprised/disappointed/
[05:30:27] <m_gol> ;)
[05:30:58] <m_gol> btw
[05:31:10] <m_gol> we discovered here in Amsterdam no one seems to maintain learn.jquery.org
[05:31:20] <m_gol> 20 PRs are waiting for any reply
[05:31:27] <DaveMethvin> (whoops)
[05:31:34] <m_gol> (to be precise, Anne discovered that)
[05:31:40] <DaveMethvin> we need some more people!
[05:31:41] <m_gol> and 78 issues :D
[05:32:03] <DaveMethvin> nobody likes doing docs except agcolom i guess ... :(
[05:32:09] <m_gol> I might merge sth from time to time, most PRs are typos etc., nothing major
[05:32:17] <m_gol> though I'd need commit access to learn.* for that ;)
[05:32:27] <m_gol> haha, right
[05:32:30] <m_gol> good to have Anne :)
[05:32:33] <m_gol> too bad only one ;)
[05:33:09] <agcolom> yes, docs are great ;-)
[07:26:37] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I think data() may have met it's match
[07:27:07] <rwaldron> rmultiDash can't know where the dash should've been for "foo42"
[07:27:10] <DaveMethvin> ut oh rwaldron
[07:27:18] <DaveMethvin> oh true
[07:27:21] <rwaldron> it may have been "data-foo-42"
[07:27:25] <rwaldron> or "data-foo42"
[07:27:27] <DaveMethvin> so what does data- attributes do there?
[07:27:34] <rwaldron> dataset?
[07:27:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[07:27:53] <rwaldron> it only has one way conversion to worry about
[07:28:06] <DaveMethvin> oh only reading
[07:28:16] <rwaldron> if you named your property "data-foo-42" or "data-foo42"
[07:28:36] <DaveMethvin> well there is a solution you know
[07:28:46] <DaveMethvin> use .attr()
[07:28:51] <DaveMethvin> :)
[07:29:02] <DaveMethvin> seems like a cantfix to me
[07:29:26] <DaveMethvin> altho we need to document it well
[07:29:44] <rwaldron> http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/9hGhG/
[07:29:52] <rwaldron> open console
[07:30:22] <rwaldron> wait
[07:30:25] <rwaldron> one sec
[07:30:37] <rwaldron> this is really strange
[07:31:10] <rwaldron> I pinged anne van kestrel about this earlier
[07:31:21] <rwaldron> because I thought "data-foo-42" was just invalid
[07:31:34] <rwaldron> 42 is not an ascii lowercase "letter"
[07:31:41] <DaveMethvin> what does the spec say? hmm
[07:31:53] <rwaldron> nothing
[07:31:57] <DaveMethvin> what does the fox say?
[07:32:01] <rwaldron> that's why I asked Anne
[07:32:12] <rwaldron> let's find out!
[07:32:34] <rwaldron> ohhh shit
[07:33:17] <DaveMethvin> http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-html5-20101019/elements.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-attributes
[07:33:55] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin this is REALLY bad
[07:34:02] <rwaldron> I was reading whatwg spec
[07:34:10] <rwaldron> http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/elements.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-*-attributes
[07:34:10] <DaveMethvin> setting names, looks like we're doing it right
[07:34:13] <rwaldron> yeah
[07:34:20] <DaveMethvin> it's just not roundtripping well
[07:34:34] <rwaldron> looks like chrome is following w3 and firefox is following whatwg
[07:34:58] <DaveMethvin> let's do something completely different then
[07:35:10] <DaveMethvin> convert to a control char or something :P
[07:36:15] <rwaldron> alert?
[07:36:16] <rwaldron> ;)
[07:36:21] <DaveMethvin> man this sucks every time i look at it
[07:37:09] <DaveMethvin> neither one seems to be able to roundtrip for someting like data-abc-123
[07:37:14] <DaveMethvin> which makes sense
[07:37:35] <rwaldron> http://gyazo.com/f478290757ed98ec74bb656d4ff9b370
[07:38:29] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[07:38:48] <rwaldron> the difference in spec is just time above
[07:38:53] <rwaldron> the latest are both aligned
[07:39:01] <rwaldron> I didn't notice that 
[07:39:39] <rwaldron> so
[07:39:44] <rwaldron> I have a horrible idea
[07:39:50] <rwaldron> if it's a number
[07:39:53] <rwaldron> try both?
[07:39:57] <rwaldron> no
[07:40:00] <DaveMethvin> no
[07:40:01] <DaveMethvin> NO
[07:40:07] <DaveMethvin> NOOOOO! :)
[07:40:08] <rwaldron> can't do that, because foo-42 and foo42 are valid
[07:40:11] <rwaldron> what the actual fuck
[07:40:25] <rwaldron> yeah seriously.... kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhn
[07:40:58] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I'm inclined to cant-fix this
[07:41:20] <DaveMethvin> yep me too, and add a docs ticket to explain it better
[07:41:38] <rwaldron> we can just use this ticket?
[07:42:00] <DaveMethvin> not for api.jquery.com, it needs a ticket there
[07:42:06] <rwaldron> oh got it
[07:42:18] <DaveMethvin> or maybe there is one already that could point back to this ticket for better explain
[07:42:48] <DaveMethvin> technically ... passing "abc-def" to our .data() method would mean it could not be a data attribute
[07:43:09] <DaveMethvin> "3.If name contains a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS character (-) followed by a lowercase ASCII letter, throw a SyntaxError exception and abort these steps."
[07:43:20] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin wait... there may be a way
[07:44:13] <DaveMethvin> think carefully, just about anything we do here will end up breaking someone's existing assumptions
[07:44:15] <rwaldron> oh in that case
[07:44:25] <rwaldron> no, i think you've found the anser
[07:44:28] <rwaldron> answer
[07:44:43] <DaveMethvin> technically yes but i fear practically no
[07:45:54] <DaveMethvin> would YOU expect that?
[07:46:04] <rwaldron> not sure what you're asking
[07:46:13] <rwaldron> I wouldn't use numbers
[07:46:28] <rwaldron> but if I was the type of person that would use numbers, I wouldn't expect anything
[07:46:34] <DaveMethvin> lol yeah
[07:46:35] <DaveMethvin> i think we're back to the dual nature of this crap
[07:46:40] <rwaldron> The lowercase ASCII letters are the characters in the range U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A to U+007A LATIN SMALL LETTER Z.
[07:47:00] <rwaldron> so, it seems to me that both FF and Chrome do the same thing
[07:47:10] <rwaldron> Chrome doesn't get any values, but FF does
[07:47:13] <DaveMethvin> the alg for getting the pairs converts to camelcase but leaves the dashes for data-abc-123
[07:47:25] <rwaldron> but the "same thing" they are doing: not converting to camel
[07:47:28] <DaveMethvin> the alg for lookup disallows "-a" but allows "-1"
[07:47:34] <rwaldron> this would be a nightmare
[07:47:40] <rwaldron> because it means:
[07:47:54] <rwaldron> data-foo-bar-42 => fooBar-42
[07:47:56] <rwaldron> NOPE
[07:48:20] <DaveMethvin> well one of them is wrong, we should figure out which is and get the browser/spec fixed! who's on our stds team? :)
[07:48:30] <progman> I am looking for someone to make an html5/jquery timeline ui interface for me.  Please PM if interested
[07:48:32] <DaveMethvin> this is a mess
[07:48:45] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I just spoke to anne again
[07:49:08] <rwaldron> he said "whatwg wins" because w3 is just copy/pasted from that spec
[07:49:58] <DaveMethvin> so jQuery Foundation pays w3c $7900 to copy/paste from WHATWG? I'd do it for half that
[07:50:15] <rwaldron> :(
[07:50:44] <DaveMethvin> seems to me the spec is saying to leave the dash alone if it precedes a number
[07:50:48] <rwaldron> yep
[07:50:51] <rwaldron> but
[07:51:41] <DaveMethvin> and to throw an error if it precedes a lowercase letter (but we could use that to mean it's only jQuery's internal data name)
[07:51:49] <rwaldron> :(
[07:52:08] <rwaldron> jQuery already has tests that prevent this
[07:52:24] <DaveMethvin> i just know people expect to get data-abc-def using .data("abc-def" ..)
[07:52:51] <rwaldron> "<DaveMethvin>	 seems to me the spec is saying to leave the dash alone if it precedes a number" yep
[07:52:58] <DaveMethvin> whereas if they tried that with dataSet it would barf
[07:53:01] <m_gol> oh god
[07:53:06] <m_gol> just read the discussion
[07:53:21] <m_gol> data-foo-bar-42 => fooBar-42
[07:53:22] <m_gol> what a nightmare
[07:53:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[07:53:58] <m_gol> I wouldn't guess that
[07:54:01] <DaveMethvin> my suggestion? use .attr()
[07:54:41] <DaveMethvin> and at least half this ain't our fault, the whole camelization process confuses a lot of devs
[07:55:19] <m_gol> right
[07:55:25] <DaveMethvin> HTML doesn't care if you uppercase an attribute name like data-HEYThere 
[07:55:33] <DaveMethvin> it's always lowercase
[07:55:45] <m_gol> right
[07:55:56] <rwaldron> this just gets worse
[07:56:09] <m_gol> HTML doesn't have upper letters, JS doesn't have dashes in names, but these numbers...
[07:56:28] <rwaldron> I sent annevk that fiddle and he said they should change "data-foo-2"=>".foo2"
[07:56:34] <rwaldron> 0_o
[07:56:44] <DaveMethvin> Wait I have a solution! Let's petition the Unicode guys to make uppercase digits!
[07:56:51] <m_gol> :)
[07:56:52] <DaveMethvin> ?cc
[07:56:53] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: CASE CLOASED >:|
[07:56:54] <rwaldron> bwahahahahaha
[07:57:06] <m_gol> lol
[07:59:03] <rwaldron> The <module> select menu in qunit is busted :(
[07:59:05] <rwaldron> "?dev=true%2F&module=data/"
[07:59:30] <DaveMethvin> i think annevk is wrong there? getting the list wouldn't remove the -2 and setting should leave it alone
[07:59:41] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin he is
[07:59:53] <rwaldron> Which bums me out
[07:59:57] <rwaldron> because he's an editor
[07:59:58] <gibson042> Roman numerals, U+2160 - U+2183 ⅩⅩⅩ :D
[08:00:01] <DaveMethvin> well if annevk is confused then lord help us all 
[08:00:04] <rwaldron> yes
[08:00:10] <rwaldron> that's what I'm driving at
[08:00:42] <DaveMethvin> and does anyone actually throw that syntax error?
[08:02:20] <rwaldron> no
[08:05:07] <DaveMethvin> looks like chrome does http://jsfiddle.net/Y7tfe/
[08:06:31] <DaveMethvin> so TECHNICALLY if someone says .data("abc-def", 42) they CANNOT POSSIBLY be talking about a data- attribute
[08:06:37] <DaveMethvin> hahaha right
[08:07:17] <DaveMethvin> i'm kinda low on battery so i have to bail for a while
[08:09:17] <rwaldron> ok
[08:35:42] <m_gol> so, I made a grunt plugin we might want to use: https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-check-dependencies
