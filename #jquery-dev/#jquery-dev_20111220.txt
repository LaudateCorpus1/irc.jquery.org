[07:04:45] <rwaldron> .
[07:04:50] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yt?
[07:05:08] <DaveMethvin> yep, sup?
[07:05:53] <rwaldron> http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/EruwC/show/light/
[07:05:56] <rwaldron> it actually doesn't
[07:06:02] <rwaldron> So, i was wrong
[07:06:20] <rwaldron> but the ticket is still invalid
[07:06:48] <DaveMethvin> well let them post a test case and we can close it if so
[07:07:01] <DaveMethvin> if they never reply then it will auto close
[07:07:12] <rwaldron> ok, fair enough
[07:07:32] <DaveMethvin> we can create test cases but you never know if it is the same situation as they describe
[07:07:40] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin http://images.wikia.com/fr.starwars/images/b/b3/Obi_wan_Kenobi.jpg
[07:07:59] <DaveMethvin> nice robe, wonder if they have that at Amazon
[07:08:42] <rwaldron> ahahaha
[07:08:48] <rwaldron> no, I meant... that's you.
[07:08:50] <rwaldron> :P
[07:09:02] <rwaldron> it is a nice rob though
[07:09:05] <rwaldron> robe*
[07:09:14] <DaveMethvin> yeah, well I figure it's better to let people prove it's broken to us
[07:09:28] <DaveMethvin> half the time i can't even figure out what they're describing
[07:09:39] <DaveMethvin> or if I can, I can't figure out why they'd do that
[07:10:07] <rwaldron> I know, you're right
[07:10:28] <DaveMethvin> so i'm browsing thru the code thinking about what can be refactored to save space
[07:10:44] <rwaldron> oh snap
[07:10:45] <rwaldron> http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/jfwvU/
[07:10:47] <DaveMethvin> seems like we could isolate a lot of the ie stuff into a severable part
[07:10:50] <rwaldron> that's what they mean
[07:10:57] <rwaldron> when the img is a child
[07:12:24] <rwaldron> no, i misread
[07:12:27] <rwaldron> sorry
[07:12:58] <rwaldron> when you use jsfiddle in chrome with the console open, the results don't clear
[07:13:07] <rwaldron> so i thought i had two requests for the image
[07:13:17] <rwaldron> but it was just the previous load
[07:13:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah just looks like one to me
[07:13:47] <rwaldron> yeah confirm
[12:26:42] <gibson042> .
[12:33:48] <Eviltwin> Pretty sure this volume slider should only go up to 11: http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#slider-vertical
[12:57:29] <rwaldron> kswedberg yt?
[12:57:43] <kswedberg> hey rwaldron!
[12:57:49] <rwaldron> Happy Birthday!
[12:57:52] <rwaldron> also...
[12:57:59] <kswedberg> hahaha. thx!
[12:58:03] <rwaldron> Popcorn.js 1.1 released today... http://popcornjs.org/popcorn-docs
[12:58:05] <rwaldron> :D!
[12:58:14] <kswedberg> rock on, rwaldron!
[12:58:27] <rwaldron> when you get a chance, i'd love your feedback
[12:58:28] <kswedberg> nice "Media Properties"
[12:59:47] <kswedberg> sure. "composed on a track events start and end" â€” is it the start and end of a track event? if so, should be "track event's start and end"
[13:01:46] <timmywil> is this using some docs engine?
[13:01:53] <timmywil> looks just like phonegap
[13:02:10] <kswedberg> rwaldron: I'll gladly give you my feedback. will look through it tonight. you want general thumbs-up/down stuff or specific suggestions or wat?
[13:02:29] <timmywil> http://docs.phonegap.com/en/1.2.0/index.html
[13:03:12] <rwaldron> kswedberg whatever you think
[13:03:34] <rwaldron> if something you see is worthy of note, I'm definitely interested in hearing about it
[13:03:49] <rwaldron> timmywil i guess it is!
[13:03:58] <rwaldron> (the students did the building)
[13:04:09] <rwaldron> i did some technical writing
[13:04:14] <timmywil> ah cool
[13:05:00] <rwaldron> i know they were looking for someone with UI chops to make it prettier
[13:17:47] <ben_alman> i commented on http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11002#comment:9

[17:52:40] <DaveMethvin> .
[17:53:03] <DaveMethvin> hey timmywil
[17:53:27] <timmywil> hey
[17:53:46] <DaveMethvin> i'm looking through the code to see if we could isolate ie 6/7/8 stuff
[17:53:53] <DaveMethvin> and how much it would save
[17:54:07] <DaveMethvin> is nodeHook needed by anything but IE?
[17:54:57] <timmywil> only ie6/7
[17:55:38] <DaveMethvin> i guess the others go through it at times even though they don't need to, just to avoid a special case?
[17:57:19] <timmywil> the only browsers that go through it are the ones that fail the getSetAttribute support test, which afaik, is only ie6/7
[17:58:01] <DaveMethvin> ah, i get it, nodeHook is undefined in .attr if it's not IE
[17:58:04] <timmywil> otherwise, nodeHook is never defined and hooks is `undefined` in attr
[17:58:10] <DaveMethvin> lol yeah
[17:58:24] <timmywil> heh
[17:58:49] <timmywil> aight, gotta run to a music practice
[17:58:55] <timmywil> ttyl dave!
[17:58:55] <DaveMethvin> ok, cya
[18:17:14] <gibson042> .
[20:28:14] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yt?
[20:28:32] <DaveMethvin> yep, what's up?
[20:28:44] <rwaldron> i think i can expose the whole process of custom elements AND reshimming in ~33 bytes
[20:29:17] <rwaldron> not that I think we should
[20:29:21] <DaveMethvin> that's a lot of bytes tho
[20:29:25] <rwaldron> agreed
[20:29:34] <DaveMethvin> you mean compressed/gzipped bytes right?
[20:29:38] <rwaldron> yep
[20:29:53] <DaveMethvin> for a corner case like that I'd say they should use something else
[20:30:22] <DaveMethvin> i've been playing with trying to isolate as much of the ie 6/7/8 stuff as possible tonight
[20:30:28] <rwaldron> if we require some yucky looking api, that demands they provide a pipe prefixed and delimited string... then less
[20:32:07] <rwaldron> meh
[20:32:11] <rwaldron> even with that
[20:32:17] <rwaldron> still +25
