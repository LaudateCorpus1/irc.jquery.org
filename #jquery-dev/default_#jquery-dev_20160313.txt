[11:16:11] <frantic1048> Hello, everyone! I'm the student who said interested in GSoC: QUnit Standard Reporter Interface(SRI) idea days before. I was drafting proposal during these days. I intend to implement SRI in Karma and digged into Karma's source. I found Karma's client is designed to work with a test framework through an adapter for extensibility, and use a internal test manager handle the context. And the manager
[11:16:14] <frantic1048> communicates with Karma server in a specific message format.
[11:16:16] <frantic1048> The idea expectation says "at least one pull requests to use that interface (with the existing adapters) in integration tools". Does it mean implement directly on Karma's internal test model, to make it natively fit to SRI(It's good, but may break many adapters/plugins). Or just implement a CRI adapter without modify to Karma itself?
[11:40:50] <frantic1048> My opinion to this is implement a framework wrapper, wraps test frameworks which uses Standard Reporter Interface. Just as last year's proposal(https://gist.github.com/jzaefferer/f551d372a1539284d376#adapter) described. Because currently there is little test framework implements Standard Reporter Interface, and the spec may change during implementating.
