[07:18:24] <kswedberg> :)
[07:18:30] <rwaldron> what the EFF
[07:37:00] <rsilva> I'll stick w/ the forum or go to #jquery if that's more appropriate, but I'm getting inconsistent results from the test suite: 2 fail in chrome; in firefox I had 8 fail but after reloading, all passed.  Is this normal?
[08:37:53] <DaveMethvin> .
[10:59:07] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin lol
[10:59:18] <ajpiano> (Robitussin, *cough*)
[10:59:21] <DaveMethvin> couldn't pass it up
[15:56:45] <mikesherov> .
[16:01:36] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you there
[16:01:41] <DaveMethvin> hey mike
[16:01:45] <mikesherov> Hey
[16:01:55] <mikesherov> Sorry I've been missing like every monday meeting
[16:02:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah you and a dozen others :D
[16:02:07] <mikesherov> I can't seem to get there ever
[16:02:20] <mikesherov> I'm redoubling my efforts to make it more often
[16:02:37] <DaveMethvin> i should do more to get us organized
[16:02:50] <DaveMethvin> for now we just need to get 1.7.2 lined up
[16:02:59] <mikesherov> sure
[16:03:03] <DaveMethvin> then make sure we start on 1.8
[16:03:03] <mikesherov> I actually wanted to talk about that
[16:03:13] <DaveMethvin> but i don't think we're in a hurry for that
[16:03:24] <mikesherov> yeah, so the ticket vote tixx.... in trac, should I move all those tickets to milestone 1.8?
[16:03:46] <DaveMethvin> oh did i forget to do that? i remember thinking I should ... 8)
[16:03:48] <mikesherov> I'm trying to clean up my personal dashboard
[16:04:18] <mikesherov> I can easily do mine, just wondering if that was the right thing to do
[16:04:26] <mikesherov> I just want to see what I really have left for 1.7.2
[16:04:30] <DaveMethvin> let me go through them tonight, feel free to grab yours
[16:04:31] <mikesherov> so I can focus
[16:04:35] <mikesherov> k
[16:04:54] <mikesherov> and the only other question I had was if 1.7.2 was correct
[16:05:07] <DaveMethvin> the ones assigned i think are right
[16:05:13] <DaveMethvin> could be some mistakes tho
[16:05:20] <mikesherov> I see there are 10 tixx there... are any missing, or are any not really in 1.7.2?
[16:05:33] <mikesherov> yeah, I mean, I think mine are right
[16:05:35] <mikesherov> just double-checking
[16:05:39] <DaveMethvin> afaik
[16:05:44] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=reopened&status=assigned&status=new&status=open&status=pending&group=status&milestone=1.7.2
[16:06:17] <mikesherov> OK, so do you have a minute to discuss ?11048
[16:06:22] <mikesherov> docs#11048
[16:06:23] <bot-t> [#11048] Broken IE6-IE9 with jQuery 1.7 and 1.7.1 (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/11048
[16:06:58] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah that one
[16:07:09] <mikesherov> My mystifying PR
[16:07:21] <DaveMethvin> when the toilet leaks you gotta jiggle the handle i guess
[16:07:29] <mikesherov> LOL
[16:07:32] <mikesherov> good analogy
[16:07:50] <mikesherov> that's my only blocker in 1.7.2
[16:07:58] <mikesherov> and it's going to get yanked in 1.8 anyhow
[16:08:11] <DaveMethvin> can you update the title of that ticket to reflect the problem?
[16:08:15] <DaveMethvin> i can land it
[16:08:16] <mikesherov> I'm fine with jiggling the handle if I can redo the whole bathroom in a few weeks
[16:08:24] <mikesherov> sure
[16:08:54] <DaveMethvin> hey don't talk about bathroom remodeling, i have two i'm working on
[16:08:58] <DaveMethvin> already got one done
[16:09:06] <DaveMethvin> but the toilets are working fine
[16:09:38] <mikesherov> lol
[16:09:46] <mikesherov> what are you working on?
[16:10:05] <DaveMethvin> our house was built in 1987, nothing but boring white ceramic tile
[16:10:13] <DaveMethvin> and CARPET in part of the master bath
[16:10:29] <DaveMethvin> might as well be a sponge
[16:10:35] <DaveMethvin> oh wait, it is
[16:11:02] <mikesherov> HAHA
[16:11:11] <mikesherov> so LITERAL bathroom remodeling
[16:11:16] <DaveMethvin> yep
[16:12:45] <mikesherov> well, good luck with that
[16:12:58] <DaveMethvin> or as bot-t would say,
[16:13:00] <mikesherov> ticket title updated
[16:13:01] <DaveMethvin> ?gl
[16:13:01] <bot-t> http://goodluckwiththatdude.com
[16:13:08] <DaveMethvin> thanks
[16:13:11] <mikesherov> haha
[16:13:34] <mikesherov> ok, so that ticket should be landable
[16:13:49] <mikesherov> one left for 1.7.2 for me!
[16:14:02] <DaveMethvin> great, i'll land that tonight
[16:14:09] <mikesherov> and it's a stupid alert in Qunit if you're running the tests from file://
[16:14:18] <mikesherov> any other 1.7.2 tickets that I can help out with?
[16:14:35] <DaveMethvin> i'll have to take a look at them, there's prolly something
[16:14:44] <DaveMethvin> gotta run but i'll be back soon
[16:16:01] <mikesherov> later
[16:20:22] <mikesherov> I hate getComputedStyle
