[08:35:45] <ajpiano> jaubourg: the team page is meant to be for only "voting team members"  we're working on a subteams page for people who are on core or any other subteam :)
[08:35:51] <JohnResig> jaubourg: I think it was because there was confusion between who was on the core team and who was atually a voting member

[10:39:46] <gnarf> JohnResig: how do you feel about adding the flag to disable rAF to the list if we release a 1.6.3?
[10:54:39] <louisremi> oh #@%! I missed the meeting again
[10:54:46] <louisremi> where are the meeting notes?
[10:55:25] <kborchers> louisremi: http://services.jquery.com/%23jquery-meeting_20110801.log.html
[10:55:37] <louisremi> kborchers: thanks
[10:55:55] <kborchers> i missed it too ;)
[11:00:49] <louisremi> gnarf: so the raf flag is back??
[11:01:08] <louisremi> (I mean the idea at least)
[11:01:58] <gnarf> i wasn't aware that idea had left
[11:02:13] <gnarf> did you ever get anywhere with your alternate idea?
[11:03:09] <louisremi> I did indeed :-) http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9381#comment:27
[11:04:26] <gnarf> i like it
[11:04:35] <gnarf> theres still a pretty big problem tho
[11:05:33] <gnarf> "slowing" the animation doesn't really solve the issue at all - people will still be trying to queue up transitions using setInterval, and they will still be queueing up more animations than should be playing
[11:06:04] <gnarf> granted, the "coming back" is a little bit better, but the issue is still the same
[11:06:50] <gnarf> i think we'd rather move to something that just throws away the frames lost and sets the final state css at some point after the queue runs
[11:18:34] <louisremi> Or maybe teach people not to let the queue build up
[11:21:21] <gnarf> heh
[11:21:42] <gnarf> i laugh because thats basically been my stance the whole time, but it wont stop :)
[11:27:37] <gnarf> they way i see it, #9381 is about removing the inconsistency in that the endTime of the animation/callbacks are unpredictable when tabbed out, your pull doesn't really address that
[11:28:00] <gnarf> it actually makes it more "noticable" and delays the end time even longer
[11:47:28] <louisremi> I'm pretty sure un-stacking the queue like everything run normally will have other negative effects,
[11:47:30] <louisremi> starting with the potential to hang the browser if the queue built up too long.
[11:48:56] <louisremi> That's certainly not an easy to solve problem when you think about it... :-/
[12:05:41] <gnarf> agreed louisremi
