[07:09:32] <Krinkle> (#jquery-meeting)
[07:20:22] <jqcommit> [13api.jquery.com] 15stijnherreman opened issue #452: Documentation of .not() overloads is unclear 02http://git.io/YdKVfg
[07:32:45] <Krinkle> rxaviers: Could you edit https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/205 and use hashed or tag'ed urls instead for the mediawiki urls?

[07:32:58] <Krinkle>  /master/ is likely to change
[08:19:04] <ralphholzmann> heyyyy DaveMethvin|away how are you dropbox referrals coming? https://www.dropbox.com/account/personal â†’ View all spaced earned â†’ if it says "Completed" next to your latest referral, you're maxed out
[08:20:32] <m_gol> I'm not maxed out ;)
[08:39:17] <DaveMethvin> ralphholzmann: I'm good now, you can take me off the rotation. Thanks!
[08:42:16] <ralphholzmann> sweet
[08:42:21] <ralphholzmann> you're welcome DaveMethvin
[11:45:22] <scottgonzalez> DaveMethvin: What's the response to "your support tests causes a layout recalculation" ?
[11:45:26] <scottgonzalez> Too bad?
[11:45:50] <DaveMethvin> is there some way to limit the scope of the recalc? Right now its full page
[11:46:13] <DaveMethvin> like, if it were wrapped in another object that was the test elements offsetParent?
[11:46:23] <DaveMethvin> s/object/element/
[11:46:56] <scottgonzalez> I don't really understand why there's a full recalc since it's absolutely positioned.
[11:48:00] <DaveMethvin> i'm not sure on that either, sounded like it happened on several browsers?
[11:48:31] <scottgonzalez> Well, he didn't provide a test case or any actual details.
[11:48:48] <scottgonzalez> Just that it forces a full-page layout recalculation in Chrome.
[11:49:01] <scottgonzalez> And that he could observe a perf hit in Firefox.
[11:49:19] <scottgonzalez> Earlier he claimed the delay was 44ms. I'm not sure how he's observing that.
[11:49:22] <DaveMethvin> a test case would be a good start, we can look at it in dev tools
[11:49:43] <DaveMethvin> the other ticket 9898 seems like a legit bug
[11:50:24] <scottgonzalez> yeah
[11:50:53] <DaveMethvin> if there's some way to limit the scope of the forced layout that would be ideal
[11:51:15] <DaveMethvin> you could also try lazy-evaluating the flag if it turns out you can't create the fake body
[11:51:59] <scottgonzalez> It sounds like the lazy evaluation is the one that's breaking.
[11:52:30] <scottgonzalez> It breaks when we're outside the head, so that means the body already exists.
[11:52:33] <scottgonzalez> So we're not creating our own.
[11:52:44] <DaveMethvin> you're doing it immediately inside the body tho
[11:52:52] <DaveMethvin> i'm saying, wait for the first call to .offset() to do it
[11:52:59] <DaveMethvin> sorry .position()
[11:53:26] <scottgonzalez> Right, but that would put us in the code path that is currently broken.
[11:53:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah, but not at load time ... :)
[11:53:47] <scottgonzalez> heh
[11:53:56] <DaveMethvin> it might be a lot less noticeable there
[11:54:33] <scottgonzalez> Sure, but that just addresses the second ticket, not the first where there's actual broken functionality.
[11:54:54] <DaveMethvin> that part is easy i think, just look for the RIGHT range
[11:55:43] <DaveMethvin> there shoudl be some way to get the browser to avoid a full-page layout on that test
[11:56:19] <DaveMethvin> but even still it would be good to wait until someone called .position() to take whatever hit remains
[11:56:28] <DaveMethvin> 44ms is long but not if it's in response to someone clicking a button and that fires the first .position()
[11:56:55] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15johnhoven opened pull request #1531: Update val.js (061.x-master...06patch-1) 02http://git.io/doVA-A
[11:57:43] <scottgonzalez> Yeah, if it's just a matter of being of by exactly 1,000, then it should be easy to fix.
[11:59:21] <DaveMethvin> seems like you could just have both cases use the negative left/top and that way there's no diff in the number you need to check
[12:00:07] <scottgonzalez> yeah
[12:00:26] <scottgonzalez> Maybe some day we'll only support browsers with fractional values.
[12:00:31] <scottgonzalez> Then the test can go away :-)
[12:01:00] <DaveMethvin> I'll wake you in the retirement home when it happens.
[12:01:19] <scottgonzalez> I'll probably die of a stress-induced heart attack first.
[12:01:53] <DaveMethvin> Here likes Scott, struck down by a browser bug.
[12:01:56] <DaveMethvin> lies
