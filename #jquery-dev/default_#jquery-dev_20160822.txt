[14:17:44] <paul_irish> my colleague phillip who works on the google CDN has been trying to get in touch with jquery UI folks but hasnt heard back. perhaps spam filters are messing with us? cc scott_gonzalez_  or jorn
[14:18:38] <paul_irish> emailed yall as well
[14:28:49] <scott_gonzalez_> paul_irish: I'll look into that now.
[14:28:56] <paul_irish> dope
[14:29:08] <scott_gonzalez_> For sure the external directory can be removed.
[14:29:34] <scott_gonzalez_> We will also remove the i18n directory in 1.13.0, but I'm pretty sure it should have stayed in 1.12.0.
[14:29:48] <scott_gonzalez_> Going to dig into changes to the release script to see where that got removed.
[14:32:52] <scott_gonzalez_> I'm guessing this was an unintended side effect of switching to the new package manager from our download builder module: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/6c738d961d9918f75a3043a49ab21ac79bca45ae
[14:33:55] <scott_gonzalez_> Despite this seeming like a mistake, I'm inclined to say we won't add it back.
[14:34:03] <scott_gonzalez_> We don't host those files on the jQuery CDN.
[14:35:42] <scott_gonzalez_> paul_irish: Are you able to see if anyone ever uses those files?
[14:35:53] <scott_gonzalez_> I don't think there's ever been documentation saying they exist.
[14:45:28] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez_: cant easily check on usage
