[09:08:26] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov arschmitz jzaefferer: Can any style checking/fixing tools handle this case?
[09:08:32] <scott_gonzalez> object/array literals vs accessors, the whitespace for literals is actually partially to visually differentiate them from accessors. contrived example, foo[[ a ][0]]
[09:08:57] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, I meant to ping markelog, not arschmitz. Not sure how I screwed that up...
[09:12:16] <markelog> scott_gonzalez: jscs can
[09:12:24] <scott_gonzalez> What's the rule?
[09:12:28] <markelog> up to the point
[09:12:33] <markelog> sec
[09:12:53] <markelog> there is a (require | disallow)SpacesInsideArrayBrackets rules
[09:13:02] <markelog> they catch array expressions
[09:13:09] <markelog> and
[09:13:11] <markelog> (require | disallow)SpacesInsideArrayBrackets
[09:13:14] <markelog> they catch everything
[09:14:12] <scott_gonzalez> But the literal and property access need to be treated differently above.
[09:14:27] <scott_gonzalez> So `foo[[ a ][0]]` is correct.
[09:17:43] <markelog> scott_gonzalez: you can do `requireSpacesInsideArrayBrackets: "all"`
[09:18:01] <scott_gonzalez> But that would make [0] wrong.
[09:18:05] <markelog> nope
[09:18:12] <markelog> that's is an accessor
[09:18:17] <scott_gonzalez> oh
[09:18:39] <markelog> you could also disallow spaces
[09:19:04] <scott_gonzalez> So what's the combination of rules to make that correct?
[09:19:14] <scott_gonzalez> What's the disallow rule that would accompany it?
[09:19:26] <markelog> http://jscs.info/rules.html#disallowSpacesInsideBrackets with "allExcept" option
[09:20:54] <markelog> hm

[09:45:33] <markelog> scott_gonzalez: yeah, unfortunately, you can only require spaces inisde array brackets, not disallow them in expressions
[09:45:49] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, thanks for digging in.
[09:45:59] <markelog> since disallowSpacesInsideBrackets is too wide
[09:46:20] <markelog> we can try to add a rule for it though
[09:48:48] <scott_gonzalez> snover gave in and agreed to just disallow spaces inside brackets.
[09:48:59] <scott_gonzalez> In the interest of finalizing something.
[09:49:15] <snover> you make it sound like it was some epic battle :)
[09:49:17] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if he's doing any style checks in his projects, but he might be interested in it.
[09:49:34] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[09:49:38] <snover> my projects are all in typescript
[09:49:48] <snover> so they get style checked by tslint
[09:56:05] <mikesherov> gibson042: opened a pr for that though.
[10:07:38] <gibson042> my PR was for a similar case, but for parentheses (expression vs. function call vs. function definition vs. expression)

[10:41:52] <agcolom> (not sure whether you saw the message)

[10:45:33] <m_gol> timmywil agcolom: I don't see a new tag in the jquery.com repo
[10:45:46] <agcolom> m_gol: Yes, I'm looking at stage

[10:45:53] <m_gol> ah
[10:46:19] <agcolom> just pushing should show on stage
[10:46:34] <agcolom> but I got the email saying that this failed

[10:54:01] <agcolom> yes, that's the one I guess
[10:54:12] <timmywil> Not sure what that means
[10:54:23] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez gnarf kborchers DaveMethvin ?
[10:54:51] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez?
[10:55:01] <gnarf> we just upgraded wordpress
[10:55:05] <gnarf> cc s5fs 
[10:55:17] <agcolom> there was the same warning on april 10th 
[10:55:32] <agcolom> for tagging 2.1.6
[10:55:38] <gnarf> have you tried running the deploy locally?
[10:55:46] <gnarf> does it get the same error?
[10:56:00] <gnarf> I'm swamped with meeting/etc right now - no time to debug
[10:56:14] <timmywil> I'm new to that, but I can try
[10:56:58] <agcolom> and that's the last email I have actually for jquery.com

[10:58:58] <timmywil> I'll try testing locally
[11:00:15] <kborchers> deploying locally here too. will let you know
[11:00:27] <kborchers> yep same error locally
[11:01:18] <timmywil> ok good, was going to take me a while to get wordpress set up locally
[11:01:41] <agcolom> kborchers: the same happened on April 10th when tagging 2.1.6
[11:02:01] <agcolom> and there's no successful deploy since then so I think the pb is there
[11:02:20] <timmywil> Heh, google showed me this issue from 3 years ago https://github.com/baalexander/node-xmlrpc/issues/61
[11:02:29] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Do you know what version of WordPress we were on before?
[11:02:36] <timmywil> jzaefferer ^
[11:09:45] <scott_gonzalez> Deploying locally works fine for me on 4.1.1.
[11:11:27] <scott_gonzalez> stage isn't even up-to-date.
[11:11:30] <scott_gonzalez> It's on 4.1-alpha.
[11:11:40] <scott_gonzalez> So what did you think was updated recently?
[11:12:11] <agcolom> I saw the same warning on April 10th by looking back at my emails
[11:12:37] <agcolom> and the deploy failed then as well, 
[11:12:56] <agcolom> and there was no successful one it seems in the meantime either on jquery.com
[11:13:06] <agcolom> (from the emails I get)
[11:13:45] <agcolom> These are the only 2 occurrences I get of that message
[11:13:52] <scott_gonzalez> Holy balls, the dependency chain is deep.
[11:14:38] <scott_gonzalez> jquery.com -> grunt-jquery-content -> grunt-wordpress -> gilded-wordpress -> wordpress -> xmlrpc -> I can finally add some debug code.
[11:17:38] <scott_gonzalez> <title>Attention Required! | CloudFlare</title>
[11:18:27] <scott_gonzalez> This only happens on calls to wp.editPost.
[11:18:56] <scott_gonzalez> It makes several succesful wp.get* calls prior to that.
[11:21:09] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I've spotted a detached head
[11:21:21] <agcolom> I think but could be completely wrong!
[11:21:23] <scott_gonzalez> That's not the problem.
[11:21:27] <agcolom> ok
[11:21:55] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: CloudFlare wants us to complete a CAPTCHA! https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/ebce32240ec9c7f37dcd
[11:22:51] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: When you said you had a problem deploying locally, did you actually mean locally?
[11:23:14] <scott_gonzalez> Because this is a CloudFlare problem, not a WordPress or grunt-jquery-content problem.
[11:28:40] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: no to vagrant
[11:28:51] <kborchers> which was at like 3.8.1 or something
[11:29:10] <kborchers> but still "local"
[11:30:41] <kborchers> ugh ... s5fs can you look into how to get around this cloudflare issue?
[11:31:03] <agcolom> oh wait...
[11:31:15] <agcolom> another occurrence was jan 25th
[11:31:26] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Stop looking..
[11:31:32] <agcolom> ok
[11:31:46] <scott_gonzalez> You can't get any useful information from those emails.
[11:32:13] <scott_gonzalez> ANY error that causes an HTML page to be returned will give the same output.
[11:32:22] <scott_gonzalez> Regardless of what content is on the page.
[11:32:33] <agcolom> ok
[11:53:19] <scott_gonzalez> markelog: I'm not trying to dismiss what you're saying. It's just that every time a discussion happens in a random PR, nobody else follows along.
[11:53:25] <scott_gonzalez> And I have the same discussion a dozen times.
[11:53:54] <markelog> scott_gonzalez: sorry, what is the context?
[11:54:35] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2243#issuecomment-97924576
[11:54:59] <markelog> scott_gonzalez: oh, okay :-) np
[11:55:38] <markelog> scott_gonzalez: didn't know it was discussed before
[11:57:44] <scott_gonzalez> That's the story of my life ;-)
[12:21:34] <timmywil> hooray! I've got everything set up and deploy works for me locally too.
[12:25:26] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez, kborchers: did we fix the issue or are we still working on it? I'd like to get jquery.com updated.
[12:26:32] <kborchers> timmywil: i have not heard from s5fs and if it is a cloudflare issue, we'll have to wait on him i think
[12:26:45] <timmywil> ah, i see
[12:26:47] <kborchers> or gnarf if he gets time
[12:33:26] <timmywil> kborchers: maybe we should send out an email just to make sure it's in s5fs's purview
[12:33:55] <timmywil> ok, I'm done bugging you guys :)
