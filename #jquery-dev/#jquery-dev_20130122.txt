[06:30:44] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: I'm trying to peer into the crystal ball regarding aliasing the "type" option to "method" for $.ajax(). Is aliasing it the first step towards replacing it? In other words, if someone were writing a book and needed to refer to that option, would that person be safer referring to it as "type" or as "method"?
[06:31:31] <kswedberg> hypothetically speaking, of course. ;)
[07:45:42] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: sorry, i'm teaching  a training class today so i'm only around at breaks ... we didn't say we're deprecating "type" so I expect it will stay around, but I think "method" is easier for people to remember
[07:46:14] <kswedberg> thanks for that non-committal answer, DaveMethvin! :D
[07:47:12] <kswedberg> and no prob about the delay. hope the training is going well. 
[07:47:39] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: so let me put it another way: If you were writing a book, which would YOU use?
[09:02:02] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: hard to say ... i like "method" but it would only work in 1.9/2.0 so example-wise it might confuse people
[09:02:06] <danheberden> hey johnbender, can you help me with a vagrant issue on the jq infra?
[09:02:23] <danheberden> METHod
[09:47:37] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: kthx. that's kinda how I feel, too. 
[09:47:48] <kswedberg> danheberden: PERFect

[10:58:01] <oliwe> the ui for resizable is broken in chrome
[10:58:13] <oliwe> wait let me come back
[10:58:15] <oliwe> with a jsfiddle
[11:02:15] <oliwe> http://jsfiddle.net/9vpNE/
[11:02:17] <oliwe> extreme example
[11:02:35] <oliwe> works great in ff
[11:03:38] <oliwe> http://jsfiddle.net/9vpNE/1/
[11:03:40] <oliwe> heres the normal one
[11:04:09] <oliwe> i think the normal one is -1px -1px
[11:04:30] <oliwe> meaning you can slowly get the thing outside of the box
[11:06:52] <oliwe> once you resize it one time
[11:06:55] <oliwe> it works flawlessly
[12:49:46] <danheberden> oliwe: you should mention that in #jqueryui-dev
[12:49:59] <danheberden> or make a bug repot
[12:50:10] <danheberden> since it's, a bug or whatever
[12:50:12] <oliwe> i dont have that much time atm
[12:50:16] <oliwe> but ill post it in there
[13:03:34] <shoky> putting position:absolute on #item solves it
[13:04:49] <oliwe> shoky i cant get the relative top and left value then
[13:11:51] <shoky> hrm there's that, yeah
[13:48:49] <timmywil> gibson042: ping
[13:48:51] <timmywil> or danheberden 
[13:48:57] <timmywil> errr, not dan, DaveMethvin 
[13:49:02] <gibson042> hey timmywil, what's up?
[13:49:14] <DaveMethvin> sup timmywil?
[13:49:18] <timmywil> gibson042: hey, did we intentionally start including file inputs when serializing forms?
[13:49:30] <timmywil> it screwed up jQuery-File-Upload
[13:49:36] <gibson042> that doesn't ring a bell for me
[13:49:50] <DaveMethvin> that may be a change I made, but doesn't seem like we should
[13:50:00] <DaveMethvin> let me find the ticket/commit
[13:50:05] <timmywil> even with a file set on the input, the value is still empty string
[13:51:21] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12134
[13:53:00] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: the spec seems to say it shoudl be serialized, but clearly it won't get the right value (the blob)
[13:53:30] <DaveMethvin> oh wait, step 7
[13:53:50] <DaveMethvin> so they're assuming file uploads are handled
[13:53:55] <DaveMethvin> and we aint
[13:56:24] <timmywil> I'm all for following spec. I can do a pull request on file-upload, but empty string for file inputs with files attached also seems wrong.
[13:57:18] <DaveMethvin> yes, it is wrong, if we want to include them we'd need to actually serialize the files timmywil
[13:57:47] <timmywil> agreed, which is something that the plugin does for us anyway
[13:58:05] <DaveMethvin> yeah so that needs to be fixed...is there a ticket?
[13:58:17] <timmywil> not yet, I just found the issue on one of my apps
[13:58:31] <DaveMethvin> oh good
[13:58:35] <timmywil> other people are having the issue, but don't know what's wrong
[13:58:49] <DaveMethvin> maybe we can fix it quick before they find out :D
[13:58:57] <DaveMethvin> but this sounds like a 1.9.1
[13:59:06] <timmywil> ok, I'll make a ticket
[14:00:07] <DaveMethvin> I think we just need to add "file" to rsubmitterTypes https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/ae215fdcf843862dbddbdfd68117ac2926e35a42
[14:00:07] <b-ot> DaveMethvin, Dave Methvin (1mon 3w ago): Fix #12134. Make .serialize() HTML5-compliant; provide a propHook for shimming.
[14:05:28] <timmywil> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13306
[14:06:35] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: sounds good to me
[17:14:14] <ajpiano> https://twitter.com/malsup/status/293883517878812672
[17:14:15] <b-ot> ajpiano, @malsup: I'm curious why jQuery didn't follow semver rules.  Despite advanced warning, 1.9 has incompatible API changes.  Same for jQuery UI 1.10
[17:14:25] <ajpiano> one of these days we should make a post about that
[17:14:30] <ajpiano> like, jQuery was *never* semver
[17:14:39] <ajpiano> i don't know why people expect that we would have started using it halfway through
