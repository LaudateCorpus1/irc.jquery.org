[07:20:35] <guy> I am 90% sure I found a bug in jQuery.
[07:21:29] <guy> http://anuary.com/#!/portfolio try scrolling. Notice that "Portfolio" submenu changes depending which element is being viewed. Now, scroll anywhere to the middle and then back to the absolute top.
[07:22:04] <guy> jQuery does not trigger the onscroll event once you are scrolling to the absolute top (though it works fine with abs bottom)
[07:22:36] <guy> oh no, wait. just figured what's possibly wrong with 10%
[18:12:45] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you here?
[18:12:55] <DaveMethvin> yep
[18:13:00] <mikesherov> There he is
[18:13:03] <DaveMethvin> sup?
[18:13:10] <mikesherov> Happy thanksgiving, I hope you had a nice one
[18:13:19] <DaveMethvin> sure did, how bout you?
[18:13:25] <mikesherov> Pretty good
[18:13:45] <mikesherov> so, a couple of things:
[18:13:56] <mikesherov> So I just realized I have trac superpowers now
[18:14:18] <DaveMethvin> yeah you can mess with tix
[18:14:22] <mikesherov> just wanted to get some guidance on a few tickets before I go all power hungry and do the wrong things
[18:14:54] <mikesherov> I have a couple of examples, you mind reviewing my decisions with me so i can be sure I get it right?
[18:15:00] <DaveMethvin> sure
[18:15:03] <DaveMethvin> in general,
[18:15:22] <DaveMethvin> if it involves something that requires a complex decision i usually discuss here
[18:15:36] <mikesherov> k
[18:15:39] <DaveMethvin> the most common are dups or invalids honestly
[18:15:45] <mikesherov> right
[18:15:51] <mikesherov> so, for this one: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8443
[18:15:53] <DaveMethvin> or ones where yo have to look at a complex example that is not a bug
[18:16:18] <mikesherov> I wanted to mark that one as needs info
[18:16:30] <mikesherov> but now that you mentioned it, it looks more like invalid now
[18:16:50] <DaveMethvin> well it may have been borked at some point?
[18:16:55] <DaveMethvin> did it work in ie9?
[18:16:58] <mikesherov> right, I'm sure it was
[18:17:18] <mikesherov> you confirmed it 8 months ago ;-)
[18:17:33] <mikesherov> but I can no longer confirm it's happening
[18:17:41] <DaveMethvin> i'm looking at the case now in ie9 to double check
[18:17:52] <mikesherov> k, thanks
[18:18:12] <mikesherov> my comment was before I knew about browserstack
[18:18:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah borked in ie9
[18:19:52] <mikesherov> k, thanks
[18:20:45] <mikesherov> that bug is the same as all the rest of them
[18:21:01] <mikesherov> there are 4 bugs in the tracker that manifest differently
[18:21:20] <DaveMethvin> well that's good...
[18:21:24] <DaveMethvin> if you have a fix :P
[18:21:50] <mikesherov> the fix is non existent
[18:22:00] <DaveMethvin> today
[18:22:07] <DaveMethvin> but tomorrow, who knows
[18:22:08] <mikesherov> right, today
[18:22:24] <mikesherov> well, anyway, can I add some keywords to it for myself?
[18:22:28] <DaveMethvin> sure
[18:22:44] <mikesherov> meaning, that and like 4 other tickets all relate to the same thing, but they aren't true dupes
[18:22:55] <DaveMethvin> right
[18:23:19] <DaveMethvin> you might want to make one the master ticket and just comment on the others that you'll handle it there but close them all when you figure out a fix
[18:23:47] <mikesherov> yeah, I'm going to do that, but not mark them as dupes
[18:23:52] <DaveMethvin> also if you want to work on the fix, go ahead and use "accept" so it will have your name on it
[18:23:57] <mikesherov> right
[18:24:12] <mikesherov> I'm going to accept a bunch of tixx now that I realized
[18:25:01] <mikesherov> ok, I have one more example
[18:25:47] <mikesherov> oh, when I accept, should I change the milestone?
[18:25:53] <mikesherov> right now, it's 1.next
[18:26:16] <DaveMethvin> if you know that you have a fix or can get one, sure
[18:26:38] <DaveMethvin> normally it would either be 1.7.2 for a bug fix or 1.8 for a feature or more complicated fix
[18:26:43] <DaveMethvin> beyond that we never know
[18:27:17] <mikesherov> ok, so I know I can get a fix this week for this
[18:27:29] <mikesherov> either that, or decide the fix isn't worth it, and make it a needsdoc
[18:27:35] <mikesherov> so I can set it to 1.7.2?
[18:27:40] <DaveMethvin> sure
[18:27:53] <mikesherov> hooray
[18:29:14] <DaveMethvin> also, trac has a bunch of notifications you can use to have it email you, once you own a ticket you'll get emails by default i think
[18:29:26] <mikesherov> right
[18:29:29] <DaveMethvin> but you can change it for whatever you want including an email for every ticket if you want
[18:29:31] <mikesherov> I use trac at my job
[18:29:45] <DaveMethvin> oh good, do you know how to fix it? :D
[18:29:55] <mikesherov> Depends on what's broken!
[18:30:06] <mikesherov> batch modify is a great plugin
[18:30:18] <mikesherov> ok, second example:
[18:30:37] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10639 and http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10117 are dupes of each other
[18:30:53] <mikesherov> in theory, I should close the newer as dupe... but I already have a PR out for it
[18:31:00] <mikesherov> and a whole bunch of comments on the ticket
[18:31:10] <mikesherov> is it acceptable if I close 10117 as the dupe?
[18:31:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah that makes sense
[18:31:31] <DaveMethvin> earliest ticket doesn't have to win
[18:31:35] <mikesherov> k
[18:32:03] <DaveMethvin> sometimes i will make a comment pointing people (like my future self) back to the dup if it  has something useful, or sometimes even copy/paste stuff from it
[18:32:31] <mikesherov> yeah, as a practice, whenever I close as dupe, I link to what it's a dupe of
[18:32:41] <mikesherov> stupid trac doesn't allow you to automatically specify
[18:32:55] <DaveMethvin> we have a field for it
[18:33:02] <DaveMethvin> so you just select that and put in the number
[18:33:20] <mikesherov> really?
[18:33:22] <mikesherov> where?
[18:33:31] <DaveMethvin> check out the resolution part
[18:33:44] <mikesherov> I did
[18:34:00] <mikesherov> OH
[18:34:02] <mikesherov> I'm a moron
[18:34:21] <DaveMethvin> you should see this: http://gyazo.com/4ec38cc5d6e64f7262fa57362c2fdd4a
[18:34:33] <DaveMethvin> yeah if you're using multiple tracs it can get confusing
[18:35:20] <mikesherov> that was a plugin I guess
[18:35:29] <mikesherov> not part of default trac
[18:35:47] <DaveMethvin> right
[18:36:10] <DaveMethvin> there was a guy who did a lot of work about a  year ago and got our trac into shape
[18:36:22] <DaveMethvin> lots of plugins plus the github integration
[18:37:21] <mikesherov> I can do some work if there are issues...
[18:37:30] <DaveMethvin> oh that would be good
[18:37:39] <DaveMethvin> seems to be okay for now
[18:38:15] <mikesherov> OK, what if I want to steal a ticket from someone
[18:38:22] <mikesherov> i.e. it was assigned to timmywil
[18:38:29] <mikesherov> and I already have a PR out for it
[18:38:45] <DaveMethvin> you should check with that person then
[18:38:53] <DaveMethvin> usually they're happy to give it up :D
[18:38:57] <timmywil> feel free :)
[18:38:58] <bot-t1> (75 hours 10 mins ago) <rwaldron> tell timmywil remind to ask you about a strange favor requested from Twitter devs
[18:39:09] <timmywil> ouch, been a while
[18:39:11] <tbranyen> lol
[18:39:17] <mikesherov> LOL
[18:39:30] <mikesherov> WOAH
[18:39:32] <mikesherov> what?
[18:39:37] <mikesherov> how does bot-t do that
[18:39:37] <timmywil> it's the holidays :)
[18:39:44] <tbranyen> magic
[18:39:51] <mikesherov> timmywil: I'm stealing 10796 from you
[18:39:57] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10796
[18:40:15] <mikesherov> AND..... stolen
[18:40:22] <DaveMethvin> muhahahaha
[18:40:23] <timmywil> that's fine
[18:40:51] <mikesherov> now that I have you here... I have a few PR's open that I'd love some feedback on when you have a chance
[18:41:01] <DaveMethvin> we're gonna come back tomorrow timmywil and there will be like 150 bugs assigned to mike
[18:41:05] <mikesherov> I had to right Dean Edwards awesome hack for Chrome
[18:41:08] <mikesherov> LOL
[18:41:23] <mikesherov> I want to crush or document all the css/dimensions bugs
[18:41:52] <DaveMethvin> so will you be around for the noon meeting tomorrow mikesherov?
[18:41:59] <mikesherov> Yeah
[18:42:08] <DaveMethvin> cool
[18:42:12] <mikesherov> I've carefully crafted my Monday lunch around the meeting
[18:42:19] <DaveMethvin> lunch is usually pretty easy for most ppl
[18:42:24] <mikesherov> if either of you want to look now: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/616
[18:42:25] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (5d, 2h ago): CSS fixes rollup: fixes #10796 and fixes #10639
[18:43:52] <mikesherov> oh, OK, so one last question, how do I go about assigning priority?
[18:44:01] <mikesherov> sounds like it's over my pay grade still
[18:44:40] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: it's not in the dropdown there?
[18:44:53] <mikesherov> no, it's there
[18:45:06] <mikesherov> I'm saying, I don't feel qualified to make that decision
[18:45:17] <DaveMethvin> oh i think it's usually kind of random anyway
[18:45:18] <mikesherov> oh, there are only 3
[18:45:25] <mikesherov> blocker, high, low
[18:45:38] <DaveMethvin> i worked on a customer ticket system where we had high and critical
[18:45:46] <DaveMethvin> nobody thinks their problem is low
[18:46:11] <mikesherov> I just accepted 2 tixx I created that I marked as low
[18:46:20] <mikesherov> is there a "my dashboard" report for trac?
[18:46:33] <DaveMethvin> if you go to custom report it selects your tickets by default
[18:46:49] <mikesherov> report 101
[18:46:52] <DaveMethvin> i think you can save/edit existing reports as well
[18:47:10] <mikesherov> yeah
[18:47:15] <mikesherov> I have 11 tickets
[18:47:43] <DaveMethvin> man that docs#10693 patch really slows down Chrome
[18:47:44] <bot-t1> [#10693]  (assigned enhancement) - http://jqbug.com/10693
[18:49:07] <mikesherov> Yeah, totally slow
[18:49:14] <mikesherov> as I mentioned in the comments
[18:49:30] <DaveMethvin> so on a case like that I wonder if we should fix it but trumpet from the heights that Chrome made us make it slow
[18:49:33] <timmywil> why is that?
[18:49:45] <mikesherov> take a look at the PR
[18:49:54] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/mikesherov/jquery/commit/e3a229f874fa8b7f45120765ddd3739cc3197fd7
[18:49:55] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery by mikesherov (1d, 11h ago): fixes #10639 OUTERWIDTH(TRUE) AND CSS('MARGIN') RETURNING % INSTEAD OF PX IN WEBKITit does this by creating an awesome hack like Dean Edwards
[18:49:56] <timmywil> you sure it's 10693?
[18:50:15] <mikesherov> it's basically Dean Edwards awesome hack for the fact that Chrome reports % values in getComputedStyle for margin
[18:50:23] <DaveMethvin> oh docs#10639
[18:50:24] <bot-t1> [#10639] outerWidth(true) and css('margin') returning % instead of px in Webkit (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/10639
[18:50:26] <timmywil> ah 39
[18:50:39] <DaveMethvin> i have dysexia
[18:50:50] <mikesherov> so I take the percentage value, I jam it into width, get the resulting px, set the width back to normal
[18:50:50] <DaveMethvin> because i am so dead sexy i guess
[18:50:57] <ryanneufeld> d is for lysdexia
[18:51:00] <mikesherov> it's an extra reflow
[18:51:01] <timmywil> hehe
[18:51:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah that reflow does it i suspect
[18:51:16] <mikesherov> I complained on the webkit bug tracker about it
[18:51:32] <mikesherov> in fact, I'm setting up an Ubuntu VM
[18:51:41] <mikesherov> just so I can build webkit myself, and fix the fucking bug
[18:51:46] <DaveMethvin> lol
[18:51:58] <mikesherov> I'm going straight to the top
[18:51:59] <DaveMethvin> i am starting to feel that way about firefox
[18:52:10] <mikesherov> so yeah, the reflow makes it slow
[18:52:31] <mikesherov> so what I tried next was storing the pixel -> percent ratio in _data() on the elem
[18:52:36] <mikesherov> which is also slow
[18:52:48] <mikesherov> so then I decided to just append an expando myself to the elem
[18:52:54] <mikesherov> which works actually really well
[18:53:09] <mikesherov> but it was another 50 bytes or so
[18:53:13] <mikesherov> and felt really really hacky
[18:53:22] <mikesherov> so at that point, I stopped and asked for feedback
[18:54:38] <DaveMethvin> i hadn't followed the path ... _data() is definitely slow
[18:54:58] <DaveMethvin> the style guide says don't use expandos but even I am not sure why
[18:55:16] <DaveMethvin> as long as they're not objects it doesn't leak in ie
[18:55:41] <mikesherov> the other problem is that I don't delete the expando if the parent's width changes
[18:55:51] <mikesherov> so the cached pixel -> percent value could get stale
[18:55:59] <DaveMethvin> that's more of an issue
[18:56:13] <DaveMethvin> so really you need to do it like that i suspect
[18:56:16] <mikesherov> Yeah, so that's why I need feedback now
[18:56:28] <DaveMethvin> but only b/c Chrome messes it up
[18:56:31] <mikesherov> It's slow, but it's correct
[18:56:49] <mikesherov> and I'm going to fix it in chrome soon, so it'll be a non-issue :-P
[18:57:02] <mikesherov> but it's borked on SAF 5.1 < too
[18:57:05] <mikesherov> which is the main issue here
[18:57:27] <mikesherov> that's not getting updated any time soon
[18:57:42] <DaveMethvin> well we are comparing a very fast wrong answer against a very slow correct one which is not a valid comparison
[18:57:53] <mikesherov> right
[18:57:54] <DaveMethvin> i mean, if slow is what it takes to get the right answer, then so be it
[18:58:01] <mikesherov> so I think the slow answer has to be the right one
[18:58:15] <mikesherov> but then again, an argument could be made that this is "needsdocs"
[18:58:18] <DaveMethvin> yep
[18:59:07] <DaveMethvin> the question is always whether the answer will satisfy people enough that they stop filing bugs
[18:59:15] <mikesherov> it will
[18:59:22] <mikesherov> it's like in 3 issues
[18:59:48] <DaveMethvin> i would say lets fix it and let the pita browsers be slow
[19:00:29] <DaveMethvin> and we can make noise about having to make this be slow because of the browsers, and point out that if people don't want their code to be slow in chrome and safari they will need to avoid percentages
[19:00:36] <mikesherov> k, well, in my PR, there is also another fix, and even a speed up for dean edwards awesome hack
[19:01:08] <mikesherov> and if you really want to laugh, open this fiddle in IE,FF, Chrome, Opera
[19:01:12] <mikesherov> http://jsfiddle.net/u4F8m/13/
[19:01:17] <mikesherov> they'll give you 4 different answers
[19:01:25] <mikesherov> margins are borked in all browsers
[19:02:22] <mikesherov> so anyway, that was 1 of my 2 questions :-)
[19:02:43] <DaveMethvin> so what is #2?
[19:02:51] <mikesherov> the other one was, when does my JSHint PR get merged in? I'm anxious to start using it!
[19:03:11] <mikesherov> there are still some stragglers, namely jaubourg
[19:03:29] <mikesherov> and I don't know what the procedure is like to getting everyone to sign on to a new tool
[19:03:35] <DaveMethvin> we should talk in the meeting and see what the issues are
[19:03:42] <mikesherov> OK
[19:03:49] <mikesherov> can you add it to the agenda?
[19:03:54] <mikesherov> if there is one?
[19:03:54] <DaveMethvin> good idea
[19:04:10] <timmywil> night guys! I'll be back in the thick of it tomorrow
[19:04:29] <DaveMethvin> bye timmywil!
[19:04:59] <mikesherov> bye!
[19:06:19] <mikesherov> OK, then I think that's it for me too
[19:06:26] <mikesherov> Thanks for the support DaveMethvin
[19:06:37] <DaveMethvin> alright, cya later! thanks for all the help
[19:06:41] <mikesherov> speak to you tomorrow
[19:06:43] <mikesherov> no problem!
