[08:11:37] <m_gol> DaveMethvin, are you here?
[08:15:16] <m_gol> what's Core policy of adding contributors to AUTHORS.txt? Are there any minimal requirements or is correcting one comma enough? ;)
[08:16:05] <DaveMethvin> i posed that question a while back when we started this, i think the conclusion was that we should be generous to encourage people to contribute. 
[08:16:12] <DaveMethvin> that said, a mere comma isn't much
[08:16:29] <DaveMethvin> you could correct it under your name and say "thanks @theirname for the catch" or something
[08:16:51] <m_gol> k, got it
[08:17:00] <DaveMethvin> basically, no absolute rule
[08:17:27] <m_gol> this specific case is about changing one byte and it seemed too little to me but wanted to make sure
[08:17:39] <m_gol> (one byte in README.md)

[08:24:42] <m_gol> oh, swarmy...
[08:25:02] <DaveMethvin> m_gol THE COMMA MADE IT FAIL!
[08:25:29] <DaveMethvin> swarmy must not have liked the README
[08:25:47] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: quick! remove all the commas!
[08:25:54] <DaveMethvin> lol
[08:34:14] <celtiore_> hi
[08:34:19] <celtiore_> When I inserted the jquery.js file in my code, I have a strange display on the page on my Nexus7, I should have a width of 1024px, but the device appears only 980px, it should be a problem of "conflict "with the viewport, can you help me fix this?
[08:34:49] <DaveMethvin> celtiore_ the folks on #jquery are your best bet
[08:35:15] <celtiore_> ok thanks you

[09:19:56] <shaan> mmh
[09:37:01] <JamesMGreene> Is NPM hosed for anyone else at the moment?
[09:37:28] <JamesMGreene> I've had some installs fail, some publishes fail, some starring that has never finished, etc.
[09:59:08] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Raging a bit?
[09:59:14] <DaveMethvin> YES
[10:31:33] <JamesMGreene> scott_gonzalez DaveMethvin: ???
[10:31:45] <DaveMethvin> in a meeting
[10:38:04] <JamesMGreene> (I meant what were you raging about ~1 hour ago?)
[11:51:57] <danheberden> DaveMethvin: i got a question when/if you have a minute
[11:52:12] <DaveMethvin> yeah just got off a call danheberden
[11:52:25] <DaveMethvin> "how do you get sand out of your crack?"
[11:52:39] <danheberden> is there any *sane* way to reuse an instantiated jQuery in an iframe?
[11:52:39] <scott_gonzalez> It's not a crack, it's a happy trail.
[11:52:50] <danheberden> i assume inner stuff relies on document and not rootjQuery
[11:52:55] <danheberden> and that's no longer public
[11:52:59] <DaveMethvin> right
[11:53:00] <scott_gonzalez> No sane way, just always provide a context.
[11:53:11] <DaveMethvin> there was a guy suggesting a way in the forums
[11:53:17] <danheberden> it's blowing up
[11:53:17] <DaveMethvin> but it seemed like a bad idea
[11:53:26] <danheberden> so was curious if y'all had gone down that road
[11:53:33] <DaveMethvin> right because of the closured variables dependent on window and document
[11:53:48] <danheberden> that was my inclination
[11:54:00] <DaveMethvin> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/save-the-jquery-factory-reuse-it-in-frames-no-2nd-network-request
[11:54:48] <danheberden> we never landed the new jQuery stuff from julien ya?
[11:55:03] <DaveMethvin> which stuff wazzat?
[11:55:44] <danheberden> one sec
[11:55:47] <danheberden> i'll find the pull req
[11:55:52] <danheberden> or maybe he just had a branch
[11:57:34] <snover> any time anyone tries to do cross-frame scripting, just stare at them in the face until they back off
[11:58:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah, even with a factory that passes in the window, there are a lot of tricky things about cross frame scripting
[11:59:19] <DaveMethvin> "but it worked for me, so can't you guys just include it in the next version and claim  you support it?"
[11:59:25] <snover> DaveMethvin: we should talk!
[11:59:31] <DaveMethvin> yah we should!
[11:59:53] <DaveMethvin> wherezat AMD branch of yours again...
[12:00:02] <snover> https://github.com/csnover/jquery/tree/2.0-amd
[12:00:07] <DaveMethvin> you said you had most of the unit tests working too?
[12:00:10] <snover> yeah
[12:00:12] <snover> i didn‚Äôt commit that stuff
[12:00:14] <snover> but I can~
[12:00:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah do it
[12:00:29] <DaveMethvin> i'll pull so i can have a local copy to play with
[12:00:44] <DaveMethvin> let's move it forward somehow
[12:02:30] <snover> DaveMethvin: ok i pushed
[12:02:52] <snover> really, the build code needs to be updated to strip the amd wrappers and then the unit testing stuff can remain unchanged for now‚Ä¶
[12:02:57] <danheberden> DaveMethvin: it's just hard when you have to do that for sandboxing
[12:03:16] <danheberden> i might just opt out of jQuery in this case
[12:05:47] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, okay, seems we're in spitting distance if removing the wrappers would take out the 800 of extra gz
[12:06:09] <DaveMethvin> snover i forget, what was your resolution for the optional dependencies?
[12:06:22] <snover> DaveMethvin: to put TODOs in and wait to talk to you :)
[12:06:29] <DaveMethvin> lol good strategy
[12:07:28] <DaveMethvin> let me play with this, i have a meeting in a few minutes but now i have a local branch so I can experiment
[12:07:32] <snover> ok
[12:07:36] <snover> enjoy~
[12:07:39] <snover> then let me know when you want to meet
[12:07:41] <snover> since i know you love meetings
[12:07:44] <snover> since you are in them all the time
[12:07:47] <DaveMethvin> thanks for your help
[12:07:52] <DaveMethvin> we can ideate
