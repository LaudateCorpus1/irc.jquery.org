[12:55:22] <m_gol> timmywil: 1.10 is completely absent as well :)
[12:55:51] <m_gol> from npm
[12:56:01] <timmywil> does the latest 1.10.x exist?
[12:56:17] <m_gol> not on npm
[12:56:24] <timmywil> ok, we can fix that
[12:56:32] <m_gol> I guess we could deprecate versions up until 1.8 but still advise to upgrade to >=1.11
[12:56:38] <m_gol> it's been out a long time
[12:56:52] <timmywil> yea, that works

[12:58:33] <m_gol> timmywil: "Versions of the jquery npm package older than 1.9.0 are patched versions that don't work in web browsers. Please upgrade to >=1.11.0."
[12:58:35] <m_gol> sounds good?
[12:58:44] <timmywil> great
[12:58:57] <m_gol> I can fire up the deprecation
[12:59:08] <timmywil> go for it!
[13:00:29] <m_gol> done
[13:02:36] <timmywil> thanks
