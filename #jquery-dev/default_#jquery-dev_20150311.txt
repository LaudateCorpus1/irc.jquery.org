[05:11:48] <GreatDanton> heya, I got a question about Google summer of code 2015 (jquery). Is this the right channel?
[05:12:17] <arthurvr> GreatDanton: Yes!
[05:12:29] <GreatDanton> okay
[05:12:47] <arthurvr> GreatDanton: Feel free to ask :D
[05:13:32] <GreatDanton> Well can you tell me how this application should look like? I saw some links on the official ideas page, but they dont look as a student applications, more like mentors applicaitons.
[05:14:00] <GreatDanton> Does it have to look like CV?
[05:14:09] <GreatDanton> or it can be more informal?
[05:17:00] <GreatDanton> arthurvr, ping :D

[08:31:08] <leobalter> jzaefferer meeting?
[08:32:03] <leobalter> JamesMGreene jzaefferer Krinkle gibson042 ping
[08:32:11] <JamesMGreene> pong
[08:32:14] <arthurvr> Hey guys
[08:32:40] <gibson042> I'm in
[08:38:07] <JamesMGreene> pinged jzaefferer on Hangouts
[08:38:25] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle re-ping
[08:40:07] <Krinkle> Hi
[08:41:21] <jzaefferer> Let's meet here!
[08:41:39] <jzaefferer> I'm already late and #jquery-meeting is still muted and I don't have OP...
[08:42:01] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene Krinkle: Since you're both here, any estimate on your availability in the coming weeks?
[08:43:11] <JamesMGreene> Not very accurate estimates these days, I've unfortunately been pulling some overtime for work lately :-\
[08:43:19] <JamesMGreene> Planning to squeeze in 1 hour today
[08:43:33] <JamesMGreene> Any top priorities for me? js-reporters?
[08:43:38] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Minimal. I can do consulting, advising and discussion. But little code writing. Maybe some code review though.
[08:44:35] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: would be great to get your input on the propEqual PR
[08:44:54] <jzaefferer> otherwise I think leobalter and me are dealing well with all the input we're getting from GSoC students
[08:45:27] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: I've got an email today from a student interested in the js-reporters project. He also suggested working on ES6 modules, but if he ends up working on js-reporters, it would be great to get your input there
[08:46:09] <JamesMGreene> k
[08:46:10] <jzaefferer> leobalter: was there something you want to discuss?
[08:46:26] <jzaefferer> gibson042: any concerns from other projects? Something Core or Sizzle need?
[08:46:50] <gibson042> nothing directly comes to mind
[08:46:58] <maniksingh92> Hi, I was interested in working on the Privly Chat Application project
[08:47:12] <leobalter> no, I'll be busy for the rest of this week, and traveling on April's 1st, the other days I will have a regular schedule.
[08:47:14] <arschmitz> maniksingh92: think your in the wrong place
[08:47:22] <maniksingh92> oops!
[08:47:57] <JamesMGreene> What about that URL issue scott_gonzalez mentioned?
[08:48:09] <maniksingh92> Haha, sorry. My bad.
[08:48:26] <scott_gonzalez> I can dig into that this afternoon.
[08:49:09] <jzaefferer> leobalter: Okay. Then I'll deal with our students :-)
[08:52:01] <jzaefferer> I guess that's all for today, thanks everyone!
[08:52:27] <arthurvr> Okay guys. bye!
[08:53:22] <JamesMGreene> k
[08:53:30] <JamesMGreene> I'll try and catch up on my 2 open PRs as well
