[06:53:30] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: can you disable the new ticket permission for everyone on Trac?
[07:30:42] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: is someone able to post that shouldn't? I have turned off registration and deleted all but a few logins
[07:31:09] <m_gol> IDK, DaveMethvin I'm apparently able to post, I thought it's a global revoke :)
[07:31:22] <DaveMethvin> you're special, m_gol :)
[07:33:14] <dougrchamberlain> Hi, I'm trying to update a bug. It seems like there is a problem with the site bugs.jquery.com.  I experience timeouts on almost every page load.  "The page you are looking for is temporarily unavailable. Please Try Again Later" 
[07:34:00] <DaveMethvin> hi dougrchamberlain, we're decommissioning the bugs.jquery.com server
[07:34:07] <DaveMethvin> and moving to github issues
[07:34:17] <DaveMethvin> which ticket was it?
[07:34:49] <dougrchamberlain> 14892  I think I have written a fix.
[07:35:15] <DaveMethvin> sorry about Trac, the problems you're seeing are the reasons why we're swtiching
[07:36:00] <DaveMethvin> ok, i remember
[07:36:01] <dougrchamberlain> yeah can't login or logout, or reset my password!  It's alright, I still want to contribute!! 
[07:36:12] <DaveMethvin> so what is the solution?
[07:38:07] <DaveMethvin> sorry, have to run ... since it's only happening in firefox i copied miketaylr on http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14892 but i know he was having probs getting to trac as well
[07:38:25] <dougrchamberlain> well, one of the guys pointed out that it was even an issue in core javascript on Firefox, so I added a property to event/support persistDynamicDisabledState
[07:39:08] <DaveMethvin> let's find out when it will be fixed in ff, it sounds like a complicated fix
[07:39:13] <DaveMethvin> oh gtg
[07:39:46] <miketaylr> yeah i can't login to comment either
[07:40:00] <miketaylr> i asked for a pw reset, it came 2 days later
[07:40:05] <dougrchamberlain> I have it working. Hey miketaylr
[07:40:06] <miketaylr> but then the link didn't work ;_;
[07:40:19] <miketaylr> hi dougrchamberlain
[07:40:33] <miketaylr> dougrchamberlain: i wasn't able to reproduce that bug in the fiddle in nightly
[07:40:38] <miketaylr> have you checked there?
[07:41:56] <dougrchamberlain> no, I was trying to find out what steps I needed to validate, what is the git checkout for nightly?  or is that 1.x(edge)?
[07:43:01] <miketaylr> dougrchamberlain: sorry, i meant firefox nightly
[07:43:16] <miketaylr> https://nightly.mozilla.org/
[07:43:33] <dougrchamberlain> oh, maybe
[07:44:17] <dougrchamberlain> but, in the meantime I'm pretty proud of my solution. it was pretty simple.
[07:45:11] <miketaylr> :)
[07:45:36] <dougrchamberlain> I added to support a property that manipulates dom to test for the issue using straight JS
[07:46:42] <dougrchamberlain> then in the event.trigger() I check for that condition and use the setTimeout() to invoke click 
[07:51:37] <dougrchamberlain> it still fails in nightly intermittently against 1.11.0 :-/
[07:56:11] <miketaylr> dougrchamberlain: can you download firefox nightly and confirm the issue is fixed
[07:56:53] <DaveMethvin> dougrchamberlain: using setTimeout doesn't fix the problem, since the caller expected the action to happen sync and now it becomes async
[07:57:11] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I confirmed I can create new tickets: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/15252
[07:57:20] <m_gol> now I can't close it, lol
[07:57:25] <DaveMethvin> haha
[07:57:54] <m_gol> you try to be nice and Trac makes a spammer out of you anwyay
[07:57:57] <m_gol> * anyway
[07:58:08] <m_gol> ok, closed
[07:58:32] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: doesn't http://bugs.jquery.com/newticket work for you?
[07:58:51] <DaveMethvin> yes it does, but go there when you're not logged in
[07:59:37] <m_gol> yeah, but shouldn't we block it globally, also for logged in users?
[07:59:55] <DaveMethvin> the list of users is only about a dozen people now
[07:59:57] <DaveMethvin> i deleted the rest
[08:00:00] <miketaylr> what happened to trac
[08:00:06] <miketaylr> why does it hate freedom
[08:00:10] <DaveMethvin> we're migrating to gh issues mikesherov 
[08:00:12] <m_gol> it would be also great if we could display "go to GitHub" instead of "TICKET_CREATE privileges are required to perform this operation" :D
[08:00:12] <DaveMethvin> miketaylr: 
[08:00:13] <m_gol> ah, ok then
[08:00:17] <miketaylr> DaveMethvin: oh neat
[08:00:28] <miketaylr> i wasn't even gonna suggest that
[08:00:31] <miketaylr> i'm sure you hear that enough
[08:00:42] <DaveMethvin> desperate times call for desperate measures
[08:00:53] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: i agree the instructions could be better
[08:00:59] <m_gol> I wonder how it's possible our Trac is a complete garbage when the UI one works fine, I guess
[08:01:04] <miketaylr> protip: if you have a bot on github to help with issues
[08:01:06] <DaveMethvin> i am not sure how to edit all those pages to get them to say what we want
[08:01:14] <miketaylr> don't have the word "bot" in his name, it will get banned
[08:01:16] <miketaylr> ;_;
[08:01:22] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: easy, just refresh 1 million times
[08:02:48] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: if you go to bugs.jquery.com not logged in there is no New Ticket link
[08:02:57] <DaveMethvin> so it's unlikely someone lands on that page
[08:02:58] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: if Trac accounts were deleted, we should move open tickets to GitHub as now people can add their own input
[08:03:23] <DaveMethvin> first we need to triage down the list on trac
[08:03:34] <DaveMethvin> but trac has been so sucky i couldn't do that
[08:03:42] <DaveMethvin> it just won't load pages most of the time
[08:03:58] <DaveMethvin> so i was hoping we'd get the group to migrate our trac so we could finish it up
[08:04:22] <DaveMethvin> because we'll need it to work, and right now it doesn't work, for my definition of work
[08:04:47] <m_gol> I was thinking about changing Trac to a set of static pages
[08:05:06] <m_gol> tickets can be cached, I guess specific searches (like, by component etc.), too
[08:05:17] <m_gol> search cannot but we could defer to Google
[08:05:36] <m_gol> and then it'd be read-only but it'd at least work
[08:05:43] <m_gol> of course, we need to migrate open tickets first ;)
[08:05:44] <DaveMethvin> something is wrong with our trac setup, but we supposedly have people working on it, so it seems like a lot of extra effort to creat something that renders trac pages to static locations
[08:06:33] <DaveMethvin> i'd really like us to focus on writing some code and getting a new version out :)
[08:06:46] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: well, our switch to GitHub suggests we don't really believe in Trac working just fine any time soon :P
[08:06:53] <m_gol> haha, true
[08:07:11] <DaveMethvin> i agree about trac but at least we can try to continue on if it stays broken
[08:07:29] <DaveMethvin> if i have to copy/pasta ticket data into new gh issues tickets i will
[08:09:20] <dougrchamberlain> Sorry for the long silence,  give it a try. It does seem to fix it in Firefox  https://github.com/dougrchamberlain/jquery/commit/73ae5b175bb6fd415eca25dee53ef9b88e8044f8
[08:10:02] <DaveMethvin> dougrchamberlain: did you run unit tests? I suspect that will break a lot of stuff
[08:10:22] <dougrchamberlain> how do I run the unit tests?
[08:10:47] <dougrchamberlain> sorry new this
[08:10:50] <DaveMethvin> several ways, but the easiest way is to open a browser and go to your localhost
[08:11:04] <DaveMethvin> i forget, does the readme mention it?
[08:11:11] <DaveMethvin> i thought it did
[08:11:46] <m_gol> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#fix-a-bug-from-a-ticket-filed-at-bugsjquerycom
[08:11:46] <dougrchamberlain> it does "Run the unit tests with a local server that supports PHP"
[08:11:56] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: btw, we should change those bugs.jquery.com references
[08:12:24] <DaveMethvin> yeah true m_gol, altho the main bugs page does point people back to gh issues
[08:12:43] <DaveMethvin> i am not sure how to make the main bugs.jquery.com page better
[08:12:56] <DaveMethvin> it needs to avoid sending people to the core issues for everything related to jquery
[08:13:55] <m_gol> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/new refers to CONTRIBUTING.md so we should perhaps put info about different bug trackers near the top
[08:14:24] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: do you want to put a PR together?
[08:14:40] <DaveMethvin> i suspect it will take a while to find them all
[08:15:29] <m_gol> DaveMetvin: will do but on Wednesday plz, I have deadlines tomorrow
[08:15:38] <DaveMethvin> oh np
[08:15:56] <DaveMethvin> i think people are managing to find the issues page :)
[08:16:08] <m_gol> yeah, much more often than the previous one :P
[08:24:58] <dougrchamberlain> awesome guys! I see how crappy my solution was! now I get all the steps required to contribute! 
[08:36:04] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15timmywil assigned issue #1673: Create bower.json during release, remove from repo 02http://git.io/az6sSQ
[10:44:36] <Krinkle> Should "Browser or Submit a bug" on jquery.com be updated to github?
[10:44:41] <Krinkle> The link to bugs.jquery.com just times out
[10:47:13] <arthurvr> For me it does too. Is it bugs.jquery.com down?
[10:48:08] <Krinkle> arthurvr: That domain runs on Trac which is often slow/overloaded, has been that way for over a year.
[10:48:22] <Krinkle> It seems jQuery has enabled the GitHub issue tracker as of last week
[10:48:32] <arthurvr> jup I saw too
[10:49:13] <arthurvr> does that mean bugs are going to be handled there?
[10:50:29] <m_gol> Krinkle: yes, we'll need to udpate all those places. Can you create the issue to track it down?
[10:50:50] <m_gol> I'll update CONTRIBUTING.md on jquery/jquery soon but I'm sure there are many more places to touch

[11:24:21] <paul_irish> what's the tldr on jquery compat?
[11:24:29] <paul_irish> sorry. was a lot of text :/
[11:25:53] <DaveMethvin> paul_irish: jquery-compat-3.0.0 will be the continuation of the current 1.x line, the one that works with ie8 
[11:26:07] <DaveMethvin> jquery 3.0.0 will be the 2.x branch
[11:26:17] <DaveMethvin> we're bumping the versions because of breaking changes
[11:26:30] <DaveMethvin> making deferred be promise/a+ compliant
[11:30:00] <m_gol> paul_irish so jquery-compat x.y.* will be API-compatible with jquery x.y.*; versions will match unlike today so we technically need a new namespace on CDNs
[11:33:19] <paul_irish> why not jquery 1.12+ ?
[11:33:45] <DaveMethvin> not semver
[11:33:53] <paul_irish> true
[11:33:58] <paul_irish> ok
[11:34:20] <DaveMethvin> and not being semver is important for the *appearance* of not breaking people's code
[11:34:21] <DaveMethvin> :)
[11:34:37] <DaveMethvin> so we can then explain that they depended on a bunch of undocumented internals
[11:35:52] <paul_irish> and you don't want to include it in the same jquery path on the CDN?
[11:36:15] <paul_irish> i guess you'l have patch releases of jquery and jquery-compat that wont line up
[11:36:17] <paul_irish> kk
[11:36:28] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's a mess
[11:36:42] <DaveMethvin> maybe kQuery
[11:56:43] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: this is really to the point! "and not being semver is important for the *appearance* of not breaking people's code"

[14:01:12] <robertmaxrees> so what's this about jquery 3.0?
[14:02:50] <m_gol> robertmaxrees: instead of jquery@1.12.0 there will be jquery-compat@3.0.0 and instead of jquery@2.2.0 there will be jquery@3.0.0; versions will match
[14:03:38] <robertmaxrees> YES.  thank you.
[14:03:56] <m_gol> we're going to try to follow semver
[14:04:23] <robertmaxrees> i mostly just care about the lockstepped version numbers personally.  i like it though.
[14:06:29] <dorian> my failed attempt to be lazy has brought me here
[14:06:43] <dorian> currently eyeballing this: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13092
[14:06:57] <dorian> which is the same as this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16527452/i-am-receiving-an-invalid-in-operand-style-error-when-trying-to-add-a-toolti
[14:07:31] <dorian> but i'm having that problem with a document that comes through as application/xhtml+xml
[14:09:32] <dorian> hypothesis: elements created through createElement when the mime type of the containing document is application/xhtml+xml become instances of Element, not HTMLElement
[14:10:04] <DaveMethvin> That seems reasonable as an assumption
[14:10:17] <dorian> whereas if they get made with createElementNS(XHTMLNS, 'a')
[14:10:40] <dorian> then they turn out proper, and have a .style property (which is what's crapping out)
[14:11:00] <dorian> ad-hoc testing suggests that's what happening
[14:11:11] <DaveMethvin> xhtml is pretty much dead, unfortunately, and i would say 95% of all pages that say they are don't validate anyway
[14:11:29] <DaveMethvin> so it's hard to justify bending over for the 5% who don't let it die
[14:11:47] <DaveMethvin> if you have suggestions for avoiding the error tho, let us know
[14:11:59] <dorian> i have a pretty good idea for a fix
[14:12:21] <dorian> could write it myself; just been away from front-end for a while
[14:12:44] <DaveMethvin> if you're the one who cares, you're the best one to do the fix
[14:12:57] <dorian> yep, i'm content to do that
[14:13:05] <DaveMethvin> or just deliver the file as text/html and be done with it
[14:13:13] <dorian> eh not that easy
[14:13:23] <robertmaxrees> legacy codebase or something?
[14:13:42] <DaveMethvin> sure, but submitting a patch, upgrading jquery, etc, is easy. :)
[14:14:17] <dorian> the content is output from xslt, which, while i can produce html5 no problem, if i make <xsl:output method="html"... it messes up because of the doctype
[14:14:29] <DaveMethvin> oh man, xslt
[14:14:35] <DaveMethvin> okay, run away now!
[14:14:39] <dorian> haha
[14:14:51] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: we use it ourselves, remember? :P
[14:15:33] <DaveMethvin> yeah, but delivering as xhtml
[14:15:41] <dorian> yeah you can't generate an empty doctype in xslt, but if you set the output method to xml, it doesn't fall back to quirks, but the namesapce is there
[14:16:40] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ...which is dead? :)
[14:17:14] <DaveMethvin> xhtml as some worshipped idea that the browser would be really strict and stop errors from happening
[14:17:31] <DaveMethvin> the web doesn't work that way
[14:17:46] <DaveMethvin> it just creates more errors
[14:18:14] <dorian> it does if you generate the output from some method that isn't concatenating strings together :P
[14:19:03] <DaveMethvin> again, if you have a fix that resolves the issue without adding a lot of size or breaking reasonable cases, give it a shot
[14:19:09] <dorian> word
[14:19:20] <DaveMethvin> and stop using xhtml! :)
[14:19:34] <dorian> haha
[14:20:30] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: you meant "yeah, but delivering as html", right? ;)
[14:20:44] <m_gol> because I see api.jquery.com returning text/html mime
[14:20:45] <dorian> do you guys have a policy doc or anything for patches
[14:20:50] <dorian> code style guide
[14:21:00] <DaveMethvin> dorian: contributing.jquery.com
[14:21:08] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: right
[14:21:23] <m_gol> DaveMethvin dorian: contribute.jquery.com actually ;)
[14:21:23] <dorian> that bug tracker is death slow
[14:21:35] <m_gol> dorian: yeah, that's why we switched to GitHub
[14:21:39] <DaveMethvin> dorian: yeah we're migrating off of it
[14:21:53] <m_gol> but old closed bugs will remain on Trac in the foreseeable future
[14:21:56] <DaveMethvin> and thanks for the correction m_gol !
[14:22:09] <dorian> ah
[14:22:14] <DaveMethvin> we have a style guide etc but you can probably guess it from the existing code
[14:22:25] <DaveMethvin> just add more spaces than you think is reasonable :)
[14:22:34] <m_gol> dorian: or even directly http://contribute.jquery.org/code/
