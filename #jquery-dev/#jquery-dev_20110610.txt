[05:57:50] <jaubourg> hi there
[11:46:02] <jdalton> http://twitter.com/jdalton/statuses/79257266536185856
[11:46:03] <socialhapy> http://bit.ly/kXFwzh @jdalton: I just remembered an old array-like-object bug from Benchmark.js. It affects at least MooTools, jQuery & Underscore too http://bit.ly/ix9ZR5
[13:33:50] <timmywil> .
[13:34:58] <timmywil> JohnResig: pingaling
[13:36:12] <JohnResig> timmywil: hey
[13:36:33] <timmywil> JohnResig: hey, what were thinking for a 1.6.2 release date?
[13:36:39] <timmywil> I think we're good to go for rc
[13:37:12] <timmywil> or you wanna just wait til monday
[13:38:42] <timmywil> JohnResig: And I still need to get with you on sizzle attributes.
[13:39:03] <JohnResig> timmywil: oh, let's discuss in on Monday
[13:39:14] <JohnResig> I guess we could do one next week although I'm traveling
[13:39:44] <timmywil> ok
[13:42:02] <timmywil> JohnResig: maybe we could add the possibility of another bug triage meet before 1.7 to the agenda as well
[13:43:29] <JohnResig> yeah
[13:43:41] <JohnResig> considering how far away 1.7 is we probably have time for a 1.6.3
[13:44:53] <timmywil> JohnResig: sounds good to me! :)
[16:28:25] <kflorence> I sometimes find jQuery methods names to be too generic, such as "find" and "closest" -- is there a reason for this
[16:29:03] <kflorence> why not firstParent() or descendents()
[16:29:29] <kflorence> descendants*
[16:31:12] <sean`> kflorence, closest matches the current object and it's parents
[16:31:18] <sean`> so firstParent makes no sens
[16:31:20] <sean`> e
[16:31:29] <kflorence> neither does "closest" that could also be closest child
[16:31:53] <sean`> it's parameters are described in it's docs
[16:31:55] <mikesherov> to keep the amount of code you need to write to a minimum. There is a fine line between clarity and wordiness in function naming
[16:32:27] <kflorence> yes i understand that, but what happens when an actual closest method comes along
[16:32:42] <sean`> it'll be documented
[16:32:43] <kflorence> ie: searches up and down the tree
[16:33:34] <kflorence> IMO, a method name should indicate fairly well what the method does without having to check the docs, the docs are for specifics
[16:34:29] <kflorence> look at browser implemented javascript functions, some of them are verbose for a reason ;)
[16:37:17] <mikesherov> fair enough
