[05:19:11] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell rwaldron Interestingly W3C has a similar brand problem because they never took any action against W3Schools.
[05:19:11] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez, Iâ€™ll tell rwaldron about that.

[08:18:58] <doesallmagic> dave.methvin: Update AUTHORS.txt based on CLA responses.
[08:43:30] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Can I get confirmation that we're dropping support for IE6 for our web sites (not our code)?
[08:44:09] <DaveMethvin> i don't know that we ever discussed it, but it seems pretty useless to support IE6 for the web site
[08:44:09] <scott_gonzalez> Meaning that we can do things that don't degrade nicely in IE6.
[08:44:31] <DaveMethvin> we have better things to do, right? :D
[08:44:47] <scott_gonzalez> I've heard a lot discussion of IE7 as the lowest target for the new sites.
[08:44:54] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Can you confirm?
[08:45:26] <scott_gonzalez> I think it makes sense to not worry about IE6 for any jQuery sites.
[08:45:55] <DaveMethvin> let's just say now that we don't bother testing IE6
[08:46:22] <scott_gonzalez> IE6 is 0.1% of our visitors :-P
[08:46:31] <scott_gonzalez> I just checked GA.
[08:46:44] <scott_gonzalez> IE as a whole is only 8.45%.
[08:46:55] <DaveMethvin> it's all devs checking docs and such
[08:46:56] <scott_gonzalez> We're dominated by Chrome, at 51%
[08:46:58] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[08:47:22] <DaveMethvin> i bet we could have it reformat drives if it was ie6 and we wouldn't get a report for several months
[08:47:40] <scott_gonzalez> YAY, first bug closed as wontfix for IE6 in UI :-)
[08:47:46] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[08:48:59] <scott_gonzalez> We can just throw "<input type crash>" in our footer.
[08:50:43] <scott_gonzalez> We're getting better :-) http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/29
[08:51:20] <scott_gonzalez> Yesterday I closed all the tickets that are fixed with the new sites.
[08:51:30] <scott_gonzalez> It made our ticket graph pretty awesome: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticketgraph
[11:23:43] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: how do you feel about trying to list .animate(props, opts) signatures first?
[11:23:54] <gnarf> even like .fadeOut( opts )
[11:24:15] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[11:24:25] <DaveMethvin> just the docs alone get to be a pain
[11:49:57] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i posted an issue on api.jquery.com repo about it
[11:50:01] <gnarf> just curious what you think
[11:50:22] <gnarf> i'd like to suggest learning that format first, and then the shortcut ( duration, easing, callback )
[11:50:44] <DaveMethvin> don't the shortcuts just allow a speed right now, gnarf?
[11:50:59] <gnarf> yes
[11:51:02] <gnarf> all optional
[11:51:03] <gnarf> sorry
[11:51:19] <DaveMethvin> i think we should keep the shortcuts simple
[11:51:25] <DaveMethvin> and not add a bunch of options
[11:51:41] <DaveMethvin> that encourages ppl to use .animate()
[11:51:59] <DaveMethvin> we took the opposite approach for the ajax shortcuts and made an unholy mess
[11:52:33] <DaveMethvin> and remember we'd need to duplicate that doc in every shortcut method
[11:52:38] <DaveMethvin> the code is short but the docs would be a pain
[12:17:35] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: There's reusable content for docs.
[12:18:01] <DaveMethvin> you mean Reusables?
[12:18:04] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/blob/master/entries/slideDown.xml
[12:18:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah, still not a fan
[12:18:44] <scott_gonzalez> Can probably even reduce that to the entire signature.
[12:18:55] <DaveMethvin> shortcuts for anything (events, effects, ajax) that have lots of options aren't really shortcuts
[12:19:07] <DaveMethvin> they're just reorganizations of the generalized apis
[12:19:22] <DaveMethvin> and i don't think they make the api easier to learn
