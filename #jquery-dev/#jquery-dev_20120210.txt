[05:08:42] <gibson042> .
[05:52:32] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: figured it out
[05:52:40] <DaveMethvin> oh good
[05:52:57] <DaveMethvin> wat was it
[05:53:04] <mikesherov> so, I remember how I got my version to work in chrome
[05:53:47] <mikesherov> which is how you get ANY version of file:// to work in chrome, regardless of whether it was before my change, before rick's change, or after
[05:54:06] <mikesherov> you have to start chrome with the flag: --allow-file-access-from-files
[05:54:38] <DaveMethvin> oh that's the same for local ajax i think
[05:54:44] <mikesherov> right
[05:54:55] <DaveMethvin> which of course we can do for our own unit tests so yeah
[05:55:00] <DaveMethvin> that sounds like a solution
[05:55:15] <mikesherov> so now I have my version working in all browsers, and rick's version broken in all browsers
[05:55:26] <DaveMethvin> ah consistency!
[05:55:35] <DaveMethvin> well i think i may want to break it again
[05:55:54] <DaveMethvin> i was looking at gibson042's pull for combining stuff in closures
[05:56:04] <mikesherov> I don't know what to make a pull request around except literally reverting rick's change, but I don't know if I can create a unit test to prove this
[05:56:07] <DaveMethvin> and wondered if we should be looking at AMD modularity
[05:56:12] <mikesherov> I think we should
[05:56:14] <mikesherov> absolutely
[05:56:18] <mikesherov> I'm a big proponent
[05:56:24] <mikesherov> *switching to mobile*
[05:56:46] <DaveMethvin> if you look at the mobile stuff it seems a bit complex but a good idea
[05:57:46] <DaveMethvin> since they strip the amd wrappers when generating their output files it's mainly a way to define dependencies for documentation and internal use
[05:57:53] <DaveMethvin> which is kind of a nice compromise
[05:58:21] <DaveMethvin> someone can clone the repo and see the depencencies across the non-built files
[05:58:51] <DaveMethvin> but nobody is "forced to use AMD" if they dont want to
[07:37:46] <jqp> not sure if it's already on the radar here, but there is a problem at http://blog.jqueryui.com
[07:55:46] <matjas> timmywil: I suppose the same goes for `"value"` on line 2364? http://jsapi.info/jquery/1.7.1/val#L2364
[07:56:05] <timmywil> yup
[08:07:43] <matjas> timmywil: hmm, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/attributes.js#L532-549 get one extra argumentâ€¦ maybe the "value" stuff was for that?
[08:08:39] <timmywil> nah, the nodeHook is just for attr
[08:08:57] <timmywil> oh, but button
[08:08:59] <timmywil> yea
[08:09:01] <timmywil> good catch
[08:09:19] <timmywil> that innerHTML ticket, I remember now
[08:09:52] <timmywil> we can still switch around type and nodeName tho
[08:10:12] <matjas> argh
[10:33:09] <prometh> hi.. i have put together a test case for what i think is a JQUERY BUG
[10:33:16] <prometh> www.mbrennen.com/help/test-case.html
[10:35:49] <ajpiano> what makes you think it's a jQuery bug
[10:36:13] <ajpiano> you have to like, describe what method you think isn't working properly or deviating from what you expect
[10:36:24] <ajpiano> a jQuery bug is not "there's a bug in my code that happens to use jQuery"
[10:37:03] <David_Souther> I believe prometh expects the button click event to bubble to his li
[10:38:23] <prometh> hmm
[10:39:10] <prometh> ajpiano: stacked animation() calls do not appear to be working
[10:39:22] <ajpiano> David_Souther: i think you mean he expects that it *wouldn't* bubble to his LI
[10:40:04] <ajpiano> prometh: you realise that when you click the button, it calls expandListItem( nextOne ) and expandListItem( theOneThatYoureCurrentlyOn ) right?
[10:40:16] <ajpiano> that's why it's staying on the one that's currently selected
[10:40:45] <prometh> oh yeah, forgot to put in a condition, thanks
[10:41:00] <prometh> there is a serious issue that i'm running into.. just gotta get this test case right
[10:41:13] <ajpiano> what do you mean by "stacked animations"
[10:41:24] <prometh> multiple calls
[10:41:44] <prometh> latter animations do not calculate the height property correctly
[10:42:17] <ajpiano> well, please put together a testcase that illustrates that
[10:42:19] <prometh> they calculate from 1px to 0px, then at the end of the animation, removes the height property... thus popping the element into view
[10:42:22] <prometh> yes
[10:42:40] <ajpiano> preferably on jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com
[10:42:47] <ajpiano> so that whoever is looking at the testcase can work with the code
[10:42:56] <prometh> thanks
[12:06:20] <prometh> ajpiano: this is gonna sound stupid, but i'm having some trouble putting together my test case... i'm new to jquery, but not javascript and there are some things that don't make sense.... think i could ask you?
[12:06:38] <prometh> i really am trying to narrow this down so that i can report the bug
[12:06:56] <ajpiano> sorry, i'm on the phone right now
[12:07:00] <prometh> all day?
[12:07:28] <ajpiano> i have a lot of other work to take care of after... :/
[12:07:30] <prometh> if you don't want to, that's fine.. should i come back?
[12:07:31] <prometh> ok
[12:08:28] <ajpiano> prometh: what i would do would be to trawl through the bug tracker
[12:08:38] <prometh> jsfiddle?
[12:08:38] <ajpiano> and see if you can find issues that sound similar to what you're experiencing
[12:08:52] <prometh> oh, bug tracker
[12:09:09] <prometh> i goggled all yesterday
[12:09:26] <ajpiano> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10848
[12:09:32] <ajpiano> not sure if that's your issue
[12:09:49] <ajpiano> prometh: also make sure you are testing your thing on the latest jquery edge versions
[12:10:05] <David_Souther> Is jsfiddle back up yet?
[12:10:17] <David_Souther> They are, good
[12:10:25] <prometh> ajpiano: nope... and edge versions?
[12:10:34] <prometh> like beats?
[12:10:36] <prometh> betas*
[12:13:14] <prometh> i can never find the right files in these git things
[12:18:43] <ajpiano> prometh: yes, the 1.7.2 beta and the latest edge release http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git.js
[12:19:08] <prometh> thanks, i will try that
[12:19:44] <danzik17> prometh: pretty sure it's not a jquery bug fyi.  your event handler logic looks wrong, but that's a discussion for #jquery
[12:20:26] <ajpiano> my eyeball verdict of the code is similar to danzik17's but i couldn't get too deep into analysis as i've been on the phone this whole time, lol
[12:20:50] <prometh> i hope it's myf ault
[12:21:01] <prometh> as that takes less time to correct
[14:16:43] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: rwaldron https://twitter.com/#!/dalmaer/status/167920657760391168
[14:17:01] <rwaldron> yeah
[14:17:09] <rwaldron> So
[14:17:17] <rwaldron> That's annoying
[14:17:30] <ajpiano> yeah i just did a fair bit of keyboard mashing
[20:59:07] <prometh> ajpiano: you wouldn't happen to be around, would you?
[21:39:51] <prometh> ok guys... here's my test case... i still think i'm running into a jquery bug:   http://jsfiddle.net/prometh/NgQ7S/
