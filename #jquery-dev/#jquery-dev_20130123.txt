[03:26:57] <siovene> Hello. I'm trying to get started to contribute to jquery, so I'm setting up the test environment. I'm currently running git's master and testing using Chromium 23.
[03:27:09] <siovene> 121 tests don't pass. Is that normal or am I missing something?
[03:28:13] <siovene> Mostly, it's the tests in the ajax module that don't pass.
[03:28:57] <siovene> Oh there, I think I have misconfigured PHP.
[04:03:54] <siovene> Ok got it. Still 10 tests failing though. I suppose that's just the current state of git master?
[06:00:32] <siovene> When running "ajax" unit tests, I'm getting "Error 405: method not allowed" on an HTTP POST on data/name.html. Does anybody know how to fix it? I'm serving using nginx and PHP5 via fastcgi.
[06:09:32] <siovene> This has something to do with the fact that nginx doesn't allow POSTing to static files.
[06:15:09] <siovene> OK, got it working with a workaround :-)

[08:41:15] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: so I tried updating grunt to 0.4.0rc7
[08:41:32] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: there seems to be a breaking change in the selector multitask
[08:42:38] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: the context object no longer contains a file property. but the items we need are still present on the context elsewhere. Should I update to use those?
[08:45:29] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: yeah, ben moved the cheese so if you can find it again we should be golden
[08:45:46] <timmywil> man, the grunt docs are daunting
[08:46:05] <DaveMethvin> i agree
[08:47:44] <timmywil> hmm, ok according to the docs the file property should still be there. Maybe we init'd wrong

[08:52:11] <timmywil> ben_alman: is the file property in the context for a mutlitask no more?
[08:52:44] <ajpiano> timmywil: to rc7 from rc4 ?
[08:53:03] <timmywil> ajpiano: it's also gone in rc5
[08:53:11] <ajpiano> timmywil: right, that's what i'm sayin
[08:53:13] <ajpiano> https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/606
[08:53:13] <b-ot> ajpiano, issue #606 by cowboy (2w 2d ago): Add setup and teardown, or revert back to this.files.
[08:53:32] <ajpiano> a bunch changed in multitasks in rc5
[08:53:41] <ajpiano> that's why went the build broke i put us on rc4
[08:53:45] <ajpiano> cause our custom tasks need to be written
[08:53:59] <ajpiano> rewritten
[08:54:20] <timmywil> ah, ok, sry. I'm also trying to get grunt watch to work
[08:54:38] <timmywil> newer grunt isn't happy about the number of files we watch
[08:56:00] <ajpiano> that seems weird
[08:56:11] <ajpiano> what does it do
[08:56:57] <timmywil> just immeditaley stops with "Fatal error: EMFILE: Too many opened files."
[08:57:37] <timmywil> If the number of files is reduced to say, only the ones at src/*.js, it works fine
[08:57:50] <timmywil> but that's where I hit the multitask issue for selector
[09:02:29] <siovene> Hi everyone. My employer is giving me the chance to contribute to jQuery. I can start with 20h/week and it could even get up to full-time, if it works out well. Can I get any pointers about where to start? I don't know about your contribution model, but I suppose I can just pick up bugs from the queue and submit pull requests?
[09:06:37] <DaveMethvin> hi siovene! Thanks for your offer. We can use people all over the place
[09:06:57] <DaveMethvin> very soon there will be content at contribute.jquery.org to explain the process
[09:07:14] <DaveMethvin> but if you're looking to help with one of the code projects the bug trackers are a great place to start
[09:08:03] <DaveMethvin> siovene: does your employer use jquery a lot in projects?
[09:09:07] <siovene> DaveMethvin: we are a major contributor to Webkit and have interest in pushing the "web" forward, i you know what I mean.
[09:09:09] <siovene> if*
[09:09:15] <DaveMethvin> awesome!
[09:09:25] <DaveMethvin> can i ask who your employer is?
[09:09:48] <siovene> sure, I work for the Intel "Open Source Technology Center"
[09:09:58] <DaveMethvin> oh, great!
[09:10:10] <DaveMethvin> i think we have some folks from intel working on things already
[09:10:31] <siovene> Yes, a guy from my team has been very active on JQM lately
[09:11:17] <siovene> anyway, I need to go for a while, I'll be back soon :)
[09:11:24] <DaveMethvin> ok, thanks!

[09:58:10] <siovene> ajpiano: thanks, that looks good. I have to check with my boss about the CLA. I suspect that our organization has signed one because we already have contributors.
[11:29:35] <siovene> Hey, so I've got a question about the unit tests. When testing JSONP, there's a REST-like test, that makes a JSONP request to data/jsonp.php/callback/. But that's a 404, because there's no PHP routing or anything in place. What am I missing, so that that test can pass?

[14:51:06] <rworth> would be covered if your company isn't able to (always the ideal, sort of an indirect donation to our non-profit mission)
