[09:44:06] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: be it jscs/esformatter, karma/browserstack-runner, everything works only half-way and seems to be too hard to get to a point where it starts paying off :/
[09:44:09] <m_gol> ok, cannot find this Sinon integration in any popular package, so far I found it: https://github.com/yanoosh/karma-sinon but it's not popular
[09:44:45] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's kind of sad
[09:45:00] <DaveMethvin> last thing you want your test runners to do is cause a lot more work
[09:45:27] <jzaefferer> I hope the BrowserStack guys can find a solution for the queuing issue, otherwise any project with more than one testsuite will suck to test with browserstack-runner
[09:45:57] <jzaefferer> otherwise it now works pretty well and they've done a great job of addressing all the issues I found pretty quickly
[09:47:19] <jzaefferer> with Timo hardly available anymore, getting off of TestSwarm gets more valuable every day
[09:47:38] <m_gol> haha, right
[09:47:51] <m_gol> at least I know how to manage browserSets now
[09:48:04] <m_gol> but I can't create a new project myself
[09:48:14] <m_gol> and QUnit should be tested on Android
[09:48:21] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15dmethvin closed pull request #1556: Core: Allow more than 2 arrays for merge function. (06master...06merge-multiple-arrays) 02http://git.io/hK2_rg
[09:48:59] <jzaefferer> this was opened two years ago and still causes most UI builds on Jenkins to end up as unstable, even when everything is green eventually: https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/217
[09:50:08] <jzaefferer> m_gol: did you try to reproduce this? https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/248#issuecomment-37329051
[09:50:42] <jzaefferer> especially https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/TestSwarm#create-users
[09:51:09] <m_gol> jzaefferer: no, but when I talked to Krinkle|detached in San Diego about jQuery Weekly task he specifically said that he prefers to create the project himself as this is not trivial if you're not used to this stuff
[09:51:25] <jzaefferer> that script has inline docs: https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/blob/master/scripts/manageProject.php
[09:51:30] <m_gol> and I'm not sure think this comment describes everything with enought details
[09:52:37] <m_gol> hmm, ok
[09:52:40] <m_gol> maybe this is easy
[09:53:31] <m_gol> jzaefferer: I just would like to not break everything by accident ;)
[09:54:13] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15dmethvin closed pull request #1558: Event: shouldn't use Sizzle on non-element nodes. Fixes #14986. (06master...06fix_comment_attr) 02http://git.io/gh9LLA
[09:58:09] <jzaefferer> m_gol: give it a try; if it ends up really breaking something badly, we can get Timo's attention eventually
[09:58:56] <m_gol> jzaefferer: ok. keep me posted at https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/251
[10:00:19] <jzaefferer> either I misunderstand you or you misunderstood me - I meant "give it a try" in your direction, not "I'll give it a try"...
[10:00:33] <jzaefferer> or did you mean "I'll keep you posted"?
[10:00:44] <m_gol> jzaefferer: yeah, I misunderstood. :D nvm, I can give it a try
[10:01:10] <jzaefferer> okay, thanks
[10:01:16] <jzaefferer> I've got a release script to clean up...
[10:02:32] <m_gol> jzaefferer: it's not clear to me how to get to it, though; what do those lines exactly mean? https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/blob/master/scripts/manageProject.php#L138-139
[10:04:05] <jzaefferer> m_gol: look below the table at https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/TestSwarm#create-users there's a "usage" line there
[10:04:13] <m_gol> k
[10:04:16] <jzaefferer> that should be the missing piece
[10:04:35] <jzaefferer> You'll still have to put the parameters together
[10:05:20] <m_gol> sure
[10:05:28] <m_gol> but at least now I know how to run it :-)
