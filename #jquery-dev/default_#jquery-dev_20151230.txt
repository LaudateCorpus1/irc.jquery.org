[11:30:17] <leobalter> gibson042 jzaefferer Krinkle JamesMGreene ping
[11:30:25] <gibson042> here
[11:31:24] <leobalter> It's a good end of the year on QUnit
[11:31:41] <leobalter> @mixed is helping a lot
[11:31:59] <gibson042> yes, definitely
[11:33:00] <leobalter> I'll need to run these days to finish the eventemitter interface 
[11:33:42] <leobalter> and the deprecated warnings. I've got some time off days this week and this weather will keep me at home
[11:33:52] <leobalter> I'll have enough time to finish both.
[11:34:18] <leobalter> I hope we can get this done by the first week of Jan. 
[11:34:48] <gibson042> yeah, I was just looking over the issues list and it seems to be in pretty good shape
[11:35:33] <gibson042> I might pick off one or two more over the next week
[11:35:46] <leobalter> that's great! 
[11:36:35] <leobalter> I'll collect the email from everyone on the team (I have yours on the git log), I believe it's going to be better for an async communication
[11:38:04] <leobalter> and until Jun 2016 I'll work on the tc39/test262 project, and I believe this time I'll be able to make a better plan to work both there and on QUnit
[11:38:38] <leobalter> btw, I joined the TC39's org on Github (not the official TC39 team) :)
[11:39:36] <leobalter> DaveMethvin ^^ 
[11:40:12] <gibson042> ooh, cool
[11:40:14] <DaveMethvin> YAY! nice going leobalter
[11:41:23] <leobalter> I cannot use the --force on this one :)
[11:45:09] <leobalter> That's it, I'll send an email to the QUnit's team with the project checkin. It might work better.
[11:46:05] <gibson042> +1
