[05:11:35] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: regarding the drag/drop events...
[05:12:31] <mikesherov> there are some relevant proxies in IE<9
[05:13:09] <DaveMethvin> oh good, i guess
[05:13:33] <mikesherov> haha
[05:13:48] <DaveMethvin> dammit i was hoping for no solution! :P
[05:14:06] <mikesherov> in IE8, there is a DataTransfer object
[05:14:23] <mikesherov> about to check it out in IE7 and IE6
[05:18:54] <mikesherov> DataTransfer object exists in IE7 as well
[05:18:59] <mikesherov> checking in IE6
[05:19:42] <mikesherov> same in IE6
[05:20:02] <mikesherov> so Drop events in all IE contain e.DataTransfer
[05:20:52] <DaveMethvin> yay! yeah i just looked up that property, http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms535861(v=vs.85).aspx
[05:23:43] <mikesherov> now, looking for proxies in IE for drag*
[05:24:06] <mikesherov> to be clear, that's dragstart, dragenter, dragover.... any others?
[05:24:58] <mikesherov> nvm, using this list: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop
[05:25:30] <DaveMethvin> yeah just looking for that
[05:26:55] <DaveMethvin> looks like drop has dataTransfer too?
[05:28:41] <DaveMethvin> so something like:  if ( !fixHook && event.dataTransfer ) { fixHook = jQuery.event.fixHooks[ event.type ] = jQuery.event.mouseHooks; }
[05:28:52] <mikesherov> yeah, let me make sure
[05:32:49] <mikesherov> brb, wireless broadband acting up
[05:37:38] <mikesherov> yeah, so that is there for drop
[05:37:41] <mikesherov> not sure about drag
[05:37:55] <DaveMethvin> looks like it is http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536923(v=vs.85).aspx
[05:38:14] <DaveMethvin> i added a note to the ticket with a proposed solution
[05:39:25] <mikesherov> cool
[05:39:29] <DaveMethvin> and i guess we need to copy over the dataTransfer property as well if we are going to detect it by that
[05:40:13] <DaveMethvin> ok thanks a lot, i think we have just about everything ready for 1.7.1 now
[05:40:25] <DaveMethvin> timmywil was still working on the support.js stuff
[05:40:45] <DaveMethvin> and i have one event ticket i've fixed but need to finish a test case
[05:41:16] <DaveMethvin> plus this one, which i think we can put in as-is but I'll check with rwaldron since it's assigned to him
[05:41:34] <mikesherov> I'm going to do some more research about IE for drag*, but just in case, anything else I could attempt to help with?
[05:42:27] <DaveMethvin> can't think of anything atm, i am going to go thru the tix to see if we missed anything important or easy
[05:43:17] <DaveMethvin> brb
[05:45:36] <mikesherov> yeah, just confirming now experimentally that all drag events have it too
[05:47:38] <mikesherov> in regards to the ability to unit test this, I wonder if we need to create a class of unit tests that are manual :-\
[05:48:50] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: that has been a constant problem with testing these kind of issues
[05:49:07] <DaveMethvin> for testing .fix() I think we should call it directly as if we are the browser
[05:49:26] <DaveMethvin> but  yeah a separate test page wouldn't hurt either
[05:49:39] <mikesherov> I mean, it might make sense to have a class of tests that need to be run by "QA"
[05:49:59] * DaveMethvin looks around for QA :)
[05:50:10] <mikesherov> shot not me!
[05:50:33] <mikesherov> no, but seriously, I would gladly QA if that would prevent bugs like this from getting into production
[05:50:41] <mikesherov> like at least before a release or something
[05:50:48] <DaveMethvin> there are a few standalone tests like /jquery/test/delegatetest.html
[05:50:57] <DaveMethvin> but i tend to run them only when i change code in that area
[05:51:05] <mikesherov> hmmm
[05:51:09] <DaveMethvin> gotta run, will be afk for about 10 minutes
[05:51:17] <mikesherov> didn't even know why those were there. I g2g to
[05:51:31] <mikesherov> later
[07:36:20] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/pv8DxA
[07:36:20] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Fix #10791. SVG clamors for special treatment of its class names. - Dave Methvin

[08:10:46] <ajpiano> hey clooth :D
[08:10:55] <Clooth> SHH. LISTENING TO ADDY.
[08:11:13] <ryanneufeld> o/ ajpiano
[08:11:30] <Clooth> ajpiano: What editor do you use?
[08:11:30] <ryanneufeld> nice job despite the audio issues
[08:11:36] <ajpiano> Clooth: vim
[08:11:46] * Clooth throws roses at ajpiano
[08:12:14] <ajpiano> Clooth: who are you in the summit
[08:12:31] <Clooth> Nico H_M_L_INEN
[08:12:33] <Clooth> lolol
[08:12:38] <ajpiano> oh nice!
[08:12:39] <ben_alman_> is there a link i can visit to see the latest jquery unit tests?
[08:13:09] <ajpiano> Clooth: so you're willing to push some pixels?
[08:13:30] <Clooth> If the need shows itself, yes :P
[08:13:33] <ajpiano> i'll let you enjoy the summit, but it's good to know you're there
[08:13:44] <ben_alman_> rwaldron, ping
[08:13:50] <Clooth> I can multitask :D
[08:14:14] <ajpiano> we're having a frontend stuff sync tomorrow, i'll work on figuring out how we can utilise you
[08:14:34] <ajpiano> like i said, we have a theme that is mostly complete, but a great number of websites to apply them to!
[08:15:18] <Clooth> I'm 8 hours ahead of CT, keep that in mind
[08:15:56] <ben_alman_> danheberden, ping
[08:16:01] <ajpiano> ah, good old CET
[08:16:30] <Clooth> GMT+2
[08:16:35] <Clooth> or something
[08:16:40] <Clooth> not sure which one it is during winter time
[08:16:42] <ajpiano> oh wow
[08:16:44] <ajpiano> are you in .fi
[08:16:46] <Clooth> Yeah
[08:16:48] <ajpiano> yep
[08:16:53] <ajpiano> knew it by the name and timezone
[08:16:57] <Clooth> :P
[08:17:02] <ajpiano> the perils of spending a decade on irc
[08:17:07] <Clooth> ahah
[08:17:08] <danheberden> mia until my talk today ben_alman_ :/
[08:17:19] <ben_alman_> damn
[08:17:25] <Clooth> IRC is originally from Finland anyway, ajpiano ahah
[08:17:25] <ben_alman_> i need to find out where this went http://swarm.jquery.org/git/jquery/test/
[08:17:30] <ben_alman_> i was linking it in my talk
[08:20:31] <timmywil> ben_alman_: it has changed quite a bit.  I imagine the suite only runs per module now, but maybe the whole suite is available somewhere
[08:20:35] <timmywil> gnarf, danheberden ^^
[08:20:39] <ben_alman_> interesting
[08:20:44] <rwaldron> ben_alman_ whats up?
[08:20:55] <ben_alman_> was wondering if there was a url that had all the jQuery unit tests
[08:20:57] <timmywil> rwaldron: is the full suite on swarm somewhere?
[08:21:03] <ben_alman_> there used to be one, it seems to be down now
[08:21:06] <rwaldron> one sec
[08:21:11] <ben_alman_> it was at http://swarm.jquery.org/git/jquery/test/
[08:21:52] <timmywil> ben_alman_: you can run the full suite on a particular commit http://swarm.jquery.org/git/jquery/780c59b89d3b7fb9bcc480aa3173693a9d633853/test/index.html
[08:22:00] <timmywil> dunno if there's a way to get latest commit
[08:22:22] <ben_alman_> it would be awesome if the link sans sha was a symbolic link to the latest sha
[08:22:36] <ben_alman_> or if it had links to tags
[08:22:38] <ben_alman_> or something
[08:22:40] <ben_alman_> no biggie
[08:22:40] <rwaldron> ben_alman_ I have the same thing timmywil has
[08:22:42] <ben_alman_> that helps
[08:22:55] <rwaldron> jzaefferer or gnarf will know best
[08:24:00] <ben_alman_> 5700+ tests
[08:24:01] <ben_alman_> awesome
[08:24:17] <ben_alman_> the last time i gave this talk it was 3800-ish
[08:24:25] <timmywil> awesome :)
[08:24:53] <rwaldron> ben_alman_ that's incorrect
[08:25:03] <rwaldron> we're at about 6200
[08:25:29] <ben_alman_> ok
[08:25:35] <timmywil> we are?
[08:25:36] <ben_alman_> it says 5700-ish on that page
[08:25:41] <ben_alman_> the # is at the top
[08:26:59] <ben_alman_> 5791 tests there
[08:27:11] <ben_alman_> fwiw, one test fails for me in chrome there
[08:27:54] <rwaldron> what the...
[08:28:07] <rwaldron> something isn't right
[08:28:27] <rwaldron> we hit 6K about 3 months ago
[08:28:37] <timmywil> rwaldron: i thought we did too
[08:28:44] <rwaldron> and when 1.7 officially released, the count was 6200 and change
[08:28:48] <rwaldron> something is fucked
[08:29:13] <timmywil> ben_alman_: which one failed?
[08:29:16] <timmywil> pic
[08:29:22] <ben_alman_> you had to ask
[08:29:25] <ben_alman_> re-running
[08:29:32] <timmywil> oh, well
[08:29:34] <timmywil> i can run
[08:29:49] <ben_alman_> http://benalman.com/grab/2f1d78.png
[08:29:56] <rwaldron> there is an exception in my console...
[08:29:57] <ben_alman_> chrome 16 beta
[08:30:02] <rwaldron> that appears to have been swallows
[08:30:08] <rwaldron> swallowed*
[08:30:10] <ben_alman_> Uncaught TypeError: Object function ( selector, context ) {
[08:30:10] <ben_alman_> 		// The jQuery object is actually just the init constructor 'enhanced'
[08:30:10] <ben_alman_> 		return new jQuery.fn.init( selector, context, rootjQuery );
[08:30:10] <ben_alman_> 	} has no method 'Callbacks'
[08:30:14] <timmywil> ben_alman_: oh, you have chrome extensions?
[08:30:14] <rwaldron> ben_alman_ yep
[08:30:16] <ben_alman_> core.js:431
[08:30:25] <ben_alman_> i use extensions
[08:30:31] <ben_alman_> gotcha
[08:30:37] <rwaldron> timmywil I'm running Incognito
[08:30:54] <ben_alman_> seems ok for me in incognito
[08:30:58] <rwaldron> and have same error
[08:31:05] <timmywil> rwaldron: and you get the error too?  cause that one is usually because some extension has added a stylesheet
[08:31:06] <ben_alman_> but i still have the error i pasted in my console
[08:31:08] <ben_alman_> re. Callbacks
[08:31:22] <timmywil> oh the callbacks error
[08:31:32] <timmywil> yea, i think i know where that's coming from
[08:31:48] <timmywil> discovered in when changing the support stuff.  one of the iframe test pages isn't including callbacks
[08:31:55] <timmywil> it*
[08:33:06] <rwaldron> timmywil yeah, same error
[08:33:10] <timmywil> test/data/support/testElementCrash.html
[08:33:14] <rwaldron> for some reason gyazo doesnt work anymore
[08:33:21] <rwaldron> otherwise I'd show it to you
[08:33:29] <timmywil> i'll roll it out before 1.7.1
[08:34:26] <rwaldron> timmywil can we get the fixed asap?
[08:34:54] <timmywil> heh, i suppose
[08:34:59] <rwaldron> Since it's not core code related, it shouldn't be an issue, right?
[08:35:03] <rwaldron> i can do it for you
[08:35:12] <rwaldron> whatever is easiest
[08:35:20] <timmywil> it's fine, i'll do it now
[08:35:24] <rwaldron> rad
[08:38:30] <rwaldron> jaubourg <3
[08:39:35] <jaubourg> hey rick
[08:39:42] <jaubourg> sup?
[08:39:49] <jqcommit> [jquery] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/uecoJg
[08:39:49] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Fix error in test suite from testElementCrash.html; did not have callbacks.js - timmywil
[08:42:07] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez yt?
[08:42:19] <scott_gonzalez> I am
[08:42:24] <rwaldron> hey dude
[08:42:30] <rwaldron> thanks for the browserstack invite
[08:42:43] <jaubourg> yeah thanks scott :)
[08:42:44] <rwaldron> bocoup actually has a 4 user paid account
[08:42:52] <rwaldron> so, you shoul give my invite to someone else :)
[08:43:28] <timmywil> whoever has safari hooked up to swarm should disconnect it
[08:44:50] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: don't worry about it, we have accounts for everything on the team
[08:45:13] <scott_gonzalez> s/everything/everyone/
[08:46:14] <scott_gonzalez> they're donated from BrowserStack
[08:51:17] <timmywil> HOLD YOUR BREATH
[08:51:48] <scott_gonzalez> OH NO
[08:52:01] <scott_gonzalez> wtf?
[08:52:17] <scott_gonzalez> getting some inconsistent results there
[08:52:39] <scott_gonzalez> and now it's all green
[08:52:40] <timmywil> where you at jenkins
[08:52:48] <timmywil> tell me!
[08:53:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure it's actually listed as a failure in jenkins
[08:53:22] <scott_gonzalez> tests failed then passed on the second run
[08:53:30] <timmywil> there weren't failures, just an Err
[08:53:48] <timmywil> besides it would have given us "STILL FAILING"
[08:53:53] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, that counts as a failure for jenkins
[08:53:54] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, it should
[08:53:59] <scott_gonzalez> not sure where the bot is
[08:54:16] <timmywil> grr, oh well
[08:54:30] <timmywil> ?tell DaveMethvin mmm http://swarm.jquery.org/job/419/
[08:54:32] <bot-t> timmywil, Okay.
[08:55:13] <DaveMethvin> so what is rong? timmywil
[08:55:14] <bot-t> (42 secs ago) <timmywil> tell DaveMethvin mmm http://swarm.jquery.org/job/419/
[08:55:24] <timmywil> nuthin!
[08:55:29] <timmywil> that's what
[08:55:36] <DaveMethvin> that is UNPOSSIBLE!
[08:55:57] <timmywil> that's the first all green i've ever seen
[08:56:18] <DaveMethvin> ?tell jq-jenkins I take back almost everything i said about you. A.most
[08:56:18] <bot-t> DaveMethvin, Okay.
[08:56:38] <timmywil> bbl, lunchtime
[08:57:37] <scott_gonzalez> heh, almost connected long enough for UI: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/418/
[08:58:00] <scott_gonzalez> this is the last full run of UI: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/229/ :-)
[08:58:26] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: i just ran against -git like yesterday and it was clean
[08:59:01] <scott_gonzalez> do we have an ETA for 1.7.1?
[08:59:26] <scott_gonzalez> we've got two outstanding bugs that can't be closed until 1.7.1
[08:59:40] <scott_gonzalez> thinking about holding of on 1.8.17 until 1.7.1 is released
[09:03:02] <necromancer> has anyone built a version of jQuery that uses underscore.js syntax for some of the functions like .each(), .map()...
[09:04:41] <scott_gonzalez> no, it would break everything
[09:18:59] <Clooth> ajpiano
[09:18:59] <Clooth> http://labs.sig.ly/minecraft-planner/plan
[09:19:08] <Clooth> A project I started earlier this year but ran out of time
[09:35:21] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: release 1.7.1!
[09:35:55] <jzaefferer> 1.7 is already more then 9 days old, 1.7.1 is long overdue
[09:36:12] <DaveMethvin> lol, well two bugs came in yesterday that we fixed today
[09:36:27] <DaveMethvin> so if we move too quickly we just end up with 1.7.2 in a week
[09:36:29] <Clooth> back!
[09:37:03] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: how is the stuff coming with support.js? that is the biggest thing left
[09:37:16] <DaveMethvin> i think we have a solution for the drag/drop one
[09:37:44] <Clooth> ajpiano: saw my link?
[09:37:48] <Clooth> just re-connected now.
[09:37:57] <ajpiano> Clooth:  yeah, looks good :)
[09:38:00] <Clooth> :D
[09:38:06] <Clooth> theming jquery-ui took the longest I'd say
[09:38:55] <ajpiano> yeah, definitely a bit tricksy
[09:39:10] <Clooth> I should finish that project
[09:39:17] <Clooth> I had nice ideas for it
[09:44:32] <Clooth> does addy come here?
[09:44:56] <ajpiano> yep
[09:45:09] <Clooth> just wanted to talk about sublime text
[09:47:56] <jzaefferer> Clooth, what about sublime?
[09:48:03] <Clooth> Nothing
[09:48:12] <Clooth> Just random chat
[09:48:18] <Clooth> since I noticed he uses it and I just started :D
[09:48:30] <jzaefferer> tried the git package yet?
[09:48:59] <Clooth> Does it add right click stuff? cause I already manage my git from terminal
[09:49:05] <Clooth> no need for right click stuff
[09:50:59] <jzaefferer> dunno about right click stuff
[09:51:12] <jzaefferer> I use commands via the command panel
[09:51:17] <jzaefferer> cmd+shift+p on osx
[09:51:27] <jzaefferer> the integration into the editor is useful
[09:51:48] <jzaefferer> quick commit current file, diff all files...
[09:52:03] <jzaefferer> basically same commands as on terminal, but no context switch
[09:52:07] <Clooth> I always use interactive add to go through hunks and review code before commiting
[09:52:44] <jzaefferer> okay, that's probably better then
[09:52:48] <jzaefferer> should give that a try :-)
[09:52:52] <jzaefferer> usually I use diff
[09:52:55] <Clooth> good practice
[09:53:01] <Clooth> think it was git add -p
[09:53:04] <jzaefferer> then commit all once I'm done
[09:53:07] <Clooth> I have an alias called gadd
[09:53:08] <Clooth> sec
[09:57:51] <Clooth> jzaefferer: https://gist.github.com/1370808
[09:58:50] <jzaefferer> thanks
[09:59:22] <jzaefferer> I've got "d" for git-diff and "s" for git-status, everything else is aliased within the git command itself
[09:59:30] <jzaefferer> like git-cm does `git commit -am`
[10:00:30] <Clooth> alias ll='ls -laG'
[10:06:01] <ben_alman_> jzaefferer, i'm updating my qunit talk for a presentation today @ the jquery summit
[10:06:02] <ben_alman_> fyi
[10:06:18] <ben_alman_> any big stuff in 1.1 that i might not be aware of?
[10:06:37] <Clooth> yeah, qunit was discontinued and we now use volunteers to delegate testing away from the offices
[10:06:47] <Clooth> a more humane approach to testing
[10:07:03] <jzaefferer> ben_alman_: not really
[10:07:05] <ben_alman_> ok
[10:07:14] <jzaefferer> check History.md for a clean commit log
[10:07:19] <ben_alman_> it's not possible to do like test.html?foo&bar now right?
[10:07:24] <ben_alman_> you have ?filter=foo
[10:07:44] <ben_alman_> does it allow tests that either foo or bar?
[10:07:57] <ben_alman_> or just substrings, like ?filter=mymodule
[10:11:41] <jzaefferer> no combos, but substrings are possible
[10:11:46] <ben_alman_> ok
[10:12:30] <ben_alman_> i'm noticing that when i do var elems = $("#something"); strictEquals(elems.someChainableMethod(), elems, "should chain");
[10:12:44] <ben_alman_> even if it succeeds it logs out the entire jQuery object, stringified
[10:12:55] <ben_alman_> which seems kinda ridiculous
[10:13:41] <jzaefferer> well, you can always fall back to ok(x === y, message)
[10:13:48] <ben_alman_> good point
[10:14:03] <ben_alman_> but that's not something i want to suggest to people
[10:14:22] <ben_alman_> hmmn
[10:14:30] <ben_alman_> it didn't always do this
[10:23:20] <timmywil> ben_alman_: for elements, we use deepEqual
[10:23:54] <timmywil> comparing arrays of elements
[10:23:59] <ben_alman_> you should use deepEqual($("selector").get(), expected.get(), "...");
[10:24:09] <ben_alman_> but i was talking about chaining
[10:24:33] <timmywil> oh i see now
[10:25:03] <ben_alman_> did you figure out where all those tests disappeared to?
[10:27:05] <timmywil> ben_alman_: just checkout 1.6.4 and there were only 5029
[10:27:10] <timmywil> checked out*
[10:27:12] <ben_alman_> k
[10:27:57] <timmywil> running 1.5.2
[10:28:02] <ben_alman_> how long does swarm keep old commits for testing?
[10:28:13] <ben_alman_> i see that it doesn't have 1.7's tests :/
[10:28:49] <timmywil> maybe only the past 15 commits
[10:28:52] <ben_alman_> i was really hoping for a permalink to some tests
[10:28:56] <ben_alman_> damn.
[10:29:11] <timmywil> yea, 1.5.2 has 4514
[10:29:17] <timmywil> so this must be right
[10:33:48] <ben_alman_> ok, i've forked jquery and checked out 1.7
[10:33:52] <ben_alman_> for a permalink to tests
[10:38:01] <ben_alman_> hmmn i have a ton of errors in the 1.7 tests in firefox
[10:38:04] <ben_alman_> wtf
[10:38:14] <ben_alman_> i did a make
[10:38:17] <timmywil> where are you running them from?
[10:38:21] <ben_alman_> my web server
[10:38:33] <timmywil> oh, which is running php?
[10:38:38] <ben_alman_> yes
[10:38:44] <timmywil> pic
[10:38:49] <ben_alman_> re-running
[10:39:09] <ben_alman_> for test 180
[10:39:12] <ben_alman_> Expected 66 assertions, but 65 were run
[10:39:18] <ben_alman_> event: .live()/.die()
[10:39:43] <ben_alman_> this is commit 47d66eaebd6d4a2ee3e037445bfac65d82fc6780
[10:39:49] <ben_alman_> "Tagging the 1.7 release."
[10:40:03] <ben_alman_> bunch of AJAX errors too
[10:40:10] <ben_alman_> it just dies there
[10:40:12] <ben_alman_> doesn't contonie
[10:40:16] <ben_alman_> continue
[10:40:18] <timmywil> a bunch of ajax errors usually means php isn't running
[10:40:27] <timmywil> the live/die test happened when the browser didn't have focus
[10:40:40] <timmywil> it required some adjustment to the test
[10:40:47] <ben_alman_> gotcha
[10:41:04] <ben_alman_> so php is required to run the unit tests?
[10:41:11] <timmywil> to run ajax tests yes
[10:41:27] <ben_alman_> and it can't just skip them?
[10:42:10] <timmywil> you can skip them by setting isLocal to true in testrunner.js, but we don't check for php in the test suite
[10:42:17] <ben_alman_> gotcha
[10:43:56] <ben_alman_> hmmn.. same error
[10:44:07] <ben_alman_> i uncommented the line in test/data/testrunner.js
[10:45:12] <timmywil> that used to run if it was swarm
[10:45:24] <timmywil> we took it out so ajax would run on swarm
[10:45:46] <timmywil> set it outside somewheres
[10:45:50] <ben_alman_> k
[10:47:08] <ben_alman_> ok, worked
[10:47:09] <ben_alman_> thx
[10:47:46] <timmywil> cool :0
[10:47:48] <timmywil> :)
[10:47:54] <timmywil> i can't type
[10:59:43] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: are you working on the support.js stuff?
[11:00:11] <ben_alman_> in QUnit, does stop() no longer accept a timeout value in milliseconds?
[11:00:34] <ben_alman_> oh shit, he changed the signature
[11:00:38] <DaveMethvin> ya
[11:00:40] <ben_alman_> good that i noticed
[11:00:55] <ben_alman_> sweet, one less slide to present!
[11:01:03] <DaveMethvin> lol you lazy bum
[11:01:22] <ben_alman_> all i want to do is help people write unit tests
[11:01:34] <DaveMethvin> looks like we have only two other tix open for 1.7.1 and both can be pushed imo
[11:01:36] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/query?milestone=1.7.1&report=205&order=status
[11:01:37] <ben_alman_> rwaldron, you know, i'm presenting on unit tests @ jquery summit today
[11:15:22] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I am.  This is what I have so far… https://github.com/timmywil/jquery/compare/master...1.7.1%2Fsupport
[11:16:21] <timmywil> There's an issue in IE6 with the boxModel test, and I need to double check the marginRight test in safari
[11:16:42] <timmywil> and do tests for ff3.6
[11:16:50] <DaveMethvin> k, just wanted to see how things were doing
[11:17:00] <timmywil> btw, these tests I'm adding aren't permanent.  I'm just making sure everything is working
[11:17:19] <DaveMethvin> yeah i figured it would be a lot of code in motion
[11:17:34] <DaveMethvin> i have a meeting 4-6 but will be around tonight and will try to get 1.7.1 out then
[11:17:45] <DaveMethvin> if not then tomorrow for sure
[11:17:49] <timmywil> ok, i'll try and get it done tonight
[11:18:15] <timmywil> i was too busy with work and other stuff yesterday
[11:18:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah i've been busy too so i know what you mean
[11:18:43] <DaveMethvin> these damn people who pay me, don't they know i'm busy with jquery work? damn them!
[11:18:50] <timmywil> on the plus side, this will save us a little more than 100b gzip
[11:18:58] <DaveMethvin> oh nice
[11:19:04] <timmywil> -108 is the current count
[11:20:36] <ben_alman_> any non-uber-complicated example for mocking ajax in jquery?
[11:20:47] <ben_alman_> julians 9-month old blog post is waaay too complex
[11:21:03] <ben_alman_> i want like 10 lines of code
[11:22:07] <DaveMethvin> ben_alman_: i agree it's too complicated, because the api is too complicated
[11:22:23] <DaveMethvin> wrap it in your own plugin and mock the subset of what you want
[11:22:27] <rwaldron> ben_alman_, you know, i'm grinding on misery inducing client work today
[11:22:48] <ben_alman_> sorry to hear it
[11:22:53] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: that misery is payin those bills, buddy!
[11:23:00] <ben_alman_> i'm writing a presentation for a unit testing framework i no longer use
[11:23:18] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yeah :\
[11:24:17] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: there seems to be a rogue 'string' in the description http://api.jquery.com/removeAttr/
[11:24:46] <timmywil> was that there to indicate the type for the argument?
[11:24:50] <DaveMethvin> whoops shoudl be "this string"
[11:24:59] <timmywil> ah
[11:25:13] <ben_alman_> anyone know how i can manually resove a jqxhr object to simulate it resolving?
[11:25:21] <ben_alman_> it's hard to figure out how to actually mock the ajax
[11:25:37] <ben_alman_> there's no example that i can see http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/
[11:25:43] <DaveMethvin> ben_alman_: you prolly just have the promise so the answer is you can't?
[11:25:44] <ben_alman_> that actually shows how to mock an ajax request
[11:25:47] <ben_alman_> um
[11:25:56] <DaveMethvin> you could create your own deferred tho
[11:26:10] <ben_alman_> that makes no sense to me
[11:26:33] <DaveMethvin> what, that the promise would encapsulate things and prevent you from dorking tham up? :P
[11:26:36] <ben_alman_> i just want to, given a request, artificially return a response
[11:26:39] <ben_alman_> no
[11:26:42] <ben_alman_> not that part
[11:26:52] <ben_alman_> i just want to mock a few ajax requests
[11:27:18] <DaveMethvin> i think that's a good question to put to jaubourg. I agree that mocking should be easier
[11:27:34] <DaveMethvin> but again i think the problem is that we've put so much crap into $.ajax that it is damn near impossible to mock
[11:27:35] <ben_alman_> his blog post on how to do it is a mega-gigantic
[11:27:44] <ben_alman_> well
[11:27:54] <DaveMethvin> create your own $.xhr and mock that, or pass thru to $.ajax
[11:28:14] <ben_alman_> like, given url "/foo" i'd like to pass {"bar" : 1} into my callback
[11:28:18] <ben_alman_> end of story
[11:28:43] <ben_alman_> i've got to give a preso on this in a few hours and i'm not happy with what i've got to deal with
[11:28:46] <ben_alman_> hrmn
[11:29:01] <ben_alman_> i drank the koolaid
[11:29:10] <ben_alman_> and am just now tasting it
[11:29:15] <ben_alman_> and it tastes like shit
[11:29:16] <DaveMethvin> and now  your tongue is all blue
[11:31:14] <ben_alman_> the first $.ajaxTransport example on http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/ is missing the 1st arg
[11:31:20] <ben_alman_> string datatype i believe
[11:31:29] <ben_alman_> unless it's even more confusing than it looks
[11:32:08] <timmywil> i dunno how much you want to mock, but http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/cr3hU/
[11:35:49] <timmywil> obviously it wouldn't be an absolute url, but i like 'yourmom.com'
[11:36:05] <timmywil> that's not something I've ever looked at, don't go there
[11:37:16] <timmywil> ben_alman_: ^^
[11:37:56] <ben_alman_> yeah that's not a good solution
[11:38:05] <ben_alman_> because then it breaks all ajax
[11:38:35] <timmywil> so want a real mock?  i thought this was just for a slide.
[11:38:41] <ben_alman_> it has to work, too
[11:38:49] <ben_alman_> i'm working on $.ajaxTransport
[11:38:57] <ben_alman_> like i'm trying to make recommendations
[11:39:01] <ben_alman_> not to fuck people over
[11:39:17] <timmywil> but that's more fun ;)
[11:42:49] <rwaldron> ben_alman_ mike wrote some kind of $.ajax mock thin
[11:42:51] <rwaldron> thing
[11:47:01] <DaveMethvin> i dunno, i think timmy's mock is good enough if it's wrapped in a way to prevent people from misusing it by doing unsupported things
[11:47:26] <DaveMethvin> in almost all the projects where i do ajax i end up wrapping it to simplify the api
[11:47:26] <timmywil> are you presenting how to mock an ajax request?
[11:48:15] <timmywil> I wasn't suggesting you show the $.ajax override
[11:48:44] <kswedberg> I've never tried it, but this here thing is called mockjax, so I imagine it's a mock $.ajax thingie: https://github.com/appendto/jquery-mockjax
[11:49:28] <timmywil> that's basically a much more complicated version of what i did
[11:50:05] <kswedberg> k
[11:50:16] <timmywil> not that I'm saying don't use it
[11:50:39] <timmywil> I don't think I correctly understand the requirement here
[12:12:37] <DaveMethvin> sorry about the trac noise guys, goin thru tix to see if we misssed anything
[12:18:33] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: no apologies
[12:24:24] <ben_alman_> ok this seems to work for very simple AJAX mocking https://gist.github.com/1371254
[12:53:41] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: you know what's awesome?
[12:53:58] <scott_gonzalez> ctrl+click on Mac = right click
[12:55:46] <ben_alman_> ok, made a few changes https://github.com/cowboy/talks/commit/c8321b1ccee3b98653b3a9b4d6925306d7d7e4d7
[12:55:47] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on talks by cowboy (58.646s ago): Updated my QUnit talk. Lots of changes.* Updated code to QUnit 1.1.0 and jQuery 1.7* Wrote my own AJAX mocking plugin* Reformatted code to remove unnecessary whitespace* (etc)
[12:56:00] <ben_alman_> heya scott_gonzalez
[12:56:11] <scott_gonzalez> hey ben_alman_
[13:00:22] <ben_alman_> DaveMethvin, timmywil take a look at this https://gist.github.com/1371254
[13:00:30] <ben_alman_> that's about as simple as i could figure out
[13:03:04] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: is it good that ctrl+click is a right click?
[13:03:36] <scott_gonzalez> nope, it means that event.metaKey || event.ctrlKey isn't really a good idea for the selectable plugin
[13:03:48] <scott_gonzalez> since we'd be capturing the equivalent of right click on OS X
[13:03:53] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, that sounds bad
[13:04:21] <DaveMethvin> well that's the problem we were running into, it seems like we need to know the platform
[13:04:28] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:04:31] <DaveMethvin> and that road is likely to contain potholes
[13:05:01] <DaveMethvin> damn these standards people, they don't standardize the important stuff
[13:05:43] <DaveMethvin> we can get some other solution into 1.7.1 if needed
[13:06:12] <DaveMethvin> we could go back to the "clobber metakey" approach for 1.7 and tackle it again in 1.8 maybe?
[13:07:15] <scott_gonzalez> well, it would give us the same problem, wouldn't it?
[13:07:37] <scott_gonzalez> wouldn't we still be reacting to the equivalent of right click?
[13:08:09] <DaveMethvin> we'll be doing what 1.6.4 did, which didn't bother anything did it?
[13:08:22] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, selectable has been working this way forever
[13:08:38] <DaveMethvin> nobody complained about ctrl-click on a mac?
[13:08:41] <scott_gonzalez> it's just that it's clearly wrong
[13:08:48] <DaveMethvin> don't let THAT stop us
[13:08:55] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[13:46:21] <Clooth> wow
[13:46:25] <Clooth> totally just crashed safari
[13:46:31] <Clooth> after I asked my question on #jqsummit
[13:49:13] <ben_alman_> DaveMethvin, has anyone considered not pushing directly to master, but always pushing to a dev branch, so that master always reflects the latest release?
[14:25:49] <DaveMethvin> ben_alman_: the latest release is tagged
[16:03:52] <Clooth> ben_alman_ no you're not
[16:03:59] <Clooth> ben underscore alman underscore
[16:23:00] <gnarf> hrm
[16:23:31] <gnarf> any ninjas around?
[16:23:33] <gnarf> pirates?
[16:23:56] <gnarf> I'm trying to figure out a cross browser .offset() without the weight of jQuery
[16:24:05] <gnarf> any tips? :)
[16:35:32] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: isn't .offset() pretty easy to extract?
[16:35:44] <gnarf> it seems pretty dependant on css too
[16:36:01] <gnarf> i was thinking about that
[16:38:18] <DaveMethvin> goood grief that offset code is more complicated than i remember
[17:04:21] <gnarf> :)
[18:02:53] <DaveMethvin> so rwaldron, is there anything we still need to wrap for 1.7.1
[18:02:55] <DaveMethvin> ?
[18:03:25] <DaveMethvin> i went thru the tix this afternoon and I think we're in good shape
[18:03:33] <DaveMethvin> just waiting for timmy on the support stuff
[20:23:34] <Clooth> soup
[23:39:39] <Clooth> hmm
