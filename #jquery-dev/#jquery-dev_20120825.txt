[13:28:32] <gnarf> johnbender: we hat the same issue
[13:28:50] <gnarf> in the UI git build
[14:04:10] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: gnarf yt?
[14:04:40] <gnarf> sup
[14:05:02] <ryanneufeld> I'm having some trouble with the jq0* images on my machine, gotta sec?
[14:05:31] <ryanneufeld> something is failing trying to reach jq01.stage.jquery.com
[14:05:56] <gnarf> something?
[14:06:01] <ryanneufeld> all I'm doing is vagrant up jq01.stage
[14:06:11] <ryanneufeld> I'll gist the log
[14:06:13] <gnarf> k
[14:07:01] <ryanneufeld> https://gist.github.com/50f37d41f76665be53e3
[14:08:02] <gnarf> hrm
[14:08:06] <gnarf> i dunno
[14:08:11] <gnarf> johnbender: ?
[14:08:21] <ryanneufeld> also, grats on rerleasing color
[14:08:50] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: seems like the DNS settings might be bad on that box?
[14:09:01] <gnarf> like trying to read a name server from your work environment or something?
[14:09:02] <ryanneufeld> weird, cause it works on my work machine just fine
[14:10:30] <ryanneufeld> odd, my resolv.conf seems to be empty too... odd
[14:11:47] <gnarf> 8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4 are generally safe dns servers btw
[14:11:51] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[14:11:59] <ryanneufeld> I have an internal DNS in my house
[14:12:05] <ryanneufeld> it forwards to those
[14:14:40] <gnarf> johnbender: how do you feel about setting up the vagrant machines to use yet another environment in puppet something like "dev" so that they can point at dev machines instead of stage machines?
[14:16:50] <gnarf> afk
[14:16:52] <ryanneuf_> hmm, forcing my DNS to be 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 didn't seem to have worked
[14:22:53] <ryanneufeld> okay, so setting the DNS on the VM seems to work. Perhaps another thing to add to the before puppet script
[15:28:26] <gnarf> anyone around?
