[10:50:37] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: yt?
[10:50:37] <bot-t> (17 hours 50 mins ago) <gnarf> tell timmywil hey - for the other 1.7 pulls I'm working on - do you want me to base them on 1.7/combined or master?
[10:50:49] <DaveMethvin> yep
[10:51:15] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: i wonder if i could move over 1.7/combined to master today
[10:51:25] <timmywil> too early?
[10:51:44] <DaveMethvin> i don't think we've found any killers that require a 1.6.5, right?
[10:52:06] <DaveMethvin> how about if we wait until the monday meeting?
[10:52:22] <DaveMethvin> i missed this week's meeting so maybe it was discussed
[10:53:03] <timmywil> just that 1.7/combined would be created. ok i can wait.  i just have more time today.
[10:53:49] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'm doing a bunch of 1.7 stuff today as well but i'm okay with waiting till monday
[10:54:01] <DaveMethvin> i don't want to do all the regression tests and close tickets until it lands on master
[10:54:56] <timmywil> ok
[10:55:53] <timmywil> ?tell gnarf I'm less worried about the pulls unless they are just huge, but basing off of 1.7/combined will avoid any conflicts
[10:55:54] <bot-t> timmywil, Okay.
[11:55:08] <danheberden> gnarf: if you never found it: services.jquery.com
[17:41:08] <timmywil> I'm probably not going to continue it, but a little experiment that makes me really appreciate Sizzle: https://github.com/timmywil/jquery/commit/ee6f6cdbdd1ebb0a495d8f6cf37f19030a48f1eb
[17:41:08] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery by timmywil (4m, 40s ago): There are lots of test failures, but most are due to the use of non-QSA selectors. matchesSelector still needs work.
[17:52:08] <rwaldron> timmywil is that "qwery", as in, the micro selector lib?
[17:52:27] <timmywil> yup
[17:52:50] <rwaldron> i dont have time to pull and run, can you tag that?
[17:52:53] <rwaldron> :)
[17:53:05] <rwaldron> I'd love to poke at it tomorrow when i get back from nyc
[17:53:41] <timmywil> i probably won't touch it for a little while.  it's on the qwery branch of my repo
[17:53:47] <rwaldron> oh ok, cool
