[15:31:32] <jzaefferer> what's going on with the "update QUnit" commits and reverts?
[15:31:44] <jzaefferer> is there something wrong with QUnit, or are you just messing around?
[15:31:48] <jzaefferer> like this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/01c5b7f7f564fe63396fd2f3e207d4f01a59f605
[15:31:53] <jzaefferer> what does that mean?
[15:32:56] <jzaefferer> also there's another QUnit update, much cooler then the last one :-)
[15:40:24] <danheberden> jzaefferer i think it's to fore jquery-git to udpate the submodule
[16:06:44] <jzaefferer> fore? force?
[16:18:36] <jaubourg> hey there

[16:19:15] <jaubourg> ?tell ben_alman IM IN UR AJAX MURDERING UR DATA
[16:19:15] <bot-t> jaubourg, Okay.
[16:20:25] <jaubourg> gnarf: seems like something we'd want to tackle?
[16:24:12] <ryanneufed> paul_irish: yt?
[18:01:13] <humph> hey all, I need to get a hold of John somehow so we can renew the processing.js domain (expired today it looks like).  Anyone have a way to connect with him?
[18:01:33] * humph bemoans finding out about the domain going down via hacker news :(
[18:03:35] <ajpiano> JohnResig: <--
[18:03:39] <ajpiano> that's one of the better ways
[18:03:47] <humph> indeed, I've tried that, but thanks
[18:03:54] <ajpiano> yeah.  i'll IM him
[18:03:57] <humph> ty
[18:04:03] <ajpiano> i suspect he may be out of the proverbial office
[18:04:27] <clarkbox> LOGZ! http://services.jquery.com
[18:04:39] <clarkbox> i still need to clean things up
[18:04:44] <ajpiano> clarkbox: <3 <3 <3
[18:04:48] <clarkbox> but i have all the bits and peices together
[18:05:33] <clarkbox> also have some stats... http://services.jquery.com/jquery_stats.html
[18:05:37] <darcyclarke> clarkbox nice
[18:06:02] <ajpiano> nice
[18:06:10] <ajpiano> i think we might be able to give you some retroactive #jquery logs
[18:06:12] <ajpiano> to throw into the mix
[18:06:20] <ajpiano> but that's definitely not a high priority
[18:06:54] <clarkbox> ah cool. just let me know where they are
[18:07:59] <eddiemonge> that question stat, is that just looking for a ? mark?
[18:09:15] <clarkbox> ya im not sure... it must be
[18:09:20] <clarkbox> one way to find out
[18:09:21] <clarkbox> a?
[18:09:22] <clarkbox> b?
[18:09:23] <clarkbox> c?
[18:09:26] <clarkbox> ;) ?
[18:09:56] <eddiemonge> not real time stats though right
[18:10:11] <clarkbox> no
[18:10:21] <clarkbox> nor is the log real time
[18:10:27] <RWhitbeck> LOL, is eddiemonge stupid or just asking too many questions?
[18:10:34] <clarkbox> though you can strip off the .html on logs, and see the real time log txt file
[18:10:46] <eddiemonge> im wondering if a line like "? toggleClass" triggers the question counter
[18:10:52] <clarkbox> eddiemonge stop using question marks ;)
[18:11:05] <RWhitbeck> ?????????????????????????????
[18:11:08] <clarkbox> its done with this script : http://pisg.sourceforge.net/
[18:11:28] <RWhitbeck> sourceforge?  that site still exists
[18:11:31] <clarkbox> ha
[18:12:14] <clarkbox> im sure its just an archive... the latest release of this was feb 2008...
[18:12:57] <clarkbox> just came across this randomly and thought it would be fun to put up. if you guys know of a more modern stat script let me know.
[18:14:13] <ajpiano> clarkbox: nah that's pretty much *the* irc stats
[18:14:23] <ajpiano> every irc channel i've ever seen stats of has stats generated by that :)
[18:15:52] <clarkbox> and same goes for the logger... its all there is as far as i could find.
[18:16:56] <ajpiano> clarkbox: that one is actually snazzier than a lot of other ones i've seen
[18:17:02] <ajpiano> most are either plaintext... or look like this
[18:17:16] <ajpiano> http://lampoon.gurpartap.com/bot/log/jquery
[18:17:24] <ajpiano> that site has the slowest #jquery logs of all time
[18:17:30] <ajpiano> OF ALL TIME
[18:17:49] <RWhitbeck> no shit
[18:17:51] <clarkbox> nice. they could use some of your cores...
[18:17:56] <RWhitbeck> still loading
[18:18:25] <clarkbox> well im not waiting for this load... ill take your word for it ajpiano
[18:18:40] <RWhitbeck> finished
[18:18:48] <clarkbox> oh ya... thats not bad.
[18:18:58] <ajpiano> it's some kind of drupal module http://druplicon.info/bot/log/drupal-dojo/2011-01-13
[18:19:04] <ajpiano> looks pretty much the same
[18:19:12] <clarkbox> bah... nevermind... drupal... it is that bad.
[18:19:17] <clarkbox> ;)
[18:20:26] <clarkbox> k im outta here. ill clean this up (better index, move it to /logs...etc..) tomorrow/this week. ill send out some details when done.
[18:20:54] <clarkbox> is there a mail list that i should maybe send out a note too when done?
[18:21:13] <ajpiano> clarkbox: just keep me and dan in the loop
[18:21:27] <clarkbox> ok sounds good. later!
[18:21:31] <ajpiano> really appreciate all your efforts! gnite!
[18:38:04] <eddiemonge> danheberden: small issue. the edgecast cdn is effed up
[18:40:41] <eddiemonge> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.js shows me 20110504 and someone else 20110509 but the server has 20110511
[18:47:58] <danheberden> eddiemonge and you both have reset your cache?
[18:48:23] <eddiemonge> yup. coldhead and ajpiano are also reporting different versions
[18:48:53] <danheberden> oh mobile, not jquery
[18:49:13] <danheberden> are you calling ?reload in the script?
[18:50:03] <eddiemonge> no. where should that be called at?
[18:50:18] <danheberden> at least i think that's the call, lemme check
[18:51:32] <danheberden> so, are you getting dif versions on jquery-git?
[18:51:57] <eddiemonge> no those look the same i think
