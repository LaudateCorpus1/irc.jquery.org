[01:25:30] <gnarf> hrm
[05:01:51] <guy_> maybe I missread the documentation, but shouldn't this work?
[05:01:52] <guy_> https://gist.github.com/80188f0f3ae61cc2f9f9
[05:04:16] <guy_> It doesn't produce any error either, which is a bit annoying.
[05:05:08] <guy_> uh. dam it. it supports only array of DOM elements.
[05:18:01] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: I closed my last two PR's
[05:19:38] <mikesherov> Should I only be working on things specifically for 1.7.1 until it goes out?
[05:21:18] <guy_> any idea where the data is leaked? https://gist.github.com/cea013e848686d84a8ed
[05:21:28] <guy_> console.log() returns empty object.
[05:22:24] <mikesherov> looking
[05:24:02] <mikesherov> I don't know the answer, but this is a support thing? Ask your question in #jquery
[05:24:14] <guy_> this looks more of a bug to me.
[05:25:07] <mikesherov> if there's a bug, you should create a jsfiddle illustrating the bug instead of gist
[05:48:55] <guy> oh... jquery-1.4.4.min.js that explains the data() bug.
[05:51:08] <DaveMethvin> guy: you're attaching the data to suggestion_box ... and this belongs in #jquery
[05:51:29] <guy> DaveMethvin: I've just explained the reason for the behaviour.
[05:51:45] <DaveMethvin> hey mikesherov
[05:52:04] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin, 4 tickets still active in 1.7 milestone: http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=open&status=pending&status=reopened&milestone=1.7&group=status&col=id&col=summary&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=component&col=version&col=keywords&order=priority
[05:52:56] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, yeah gotta pull those up to somewhere
[05:54:37] <mikesherov> I closed my last two PR's. I'm intrigued about jaubourg's comments though.
[05:55:39] <mikesherov> I mean, I'm really not sure if I should open tickets, or compile a google doc or whatever. Mostly, I just want to fix some broken windows. I can put together a google doc there, but not clear on how to get core team talking about it afterwards
[05:57:06] <mikesherov> gotta run, I'll speak to you later
[05:57:09] <mikesherov> thans agains!
[05:57:16] <DaveMethvin> k, i just cleanded those up
[05:57:20] <DaveMethvin> cyl
[06:18:24] <guy> maybe it is just me, but I find 3rd parameter being "data" highly unreasonable... [.on( events [, selector] [, data], handler )]
[06:59:00] <DaveMethvin> guy: why?
[07:12:36] <guy> DaveMethvin: well, because throughout my n years of experience I never had need of such thing.
[07:12:45] <guy> or at least not as often to put it before handler
[07:13:09] <DaveMethvin> it is optional, leave it out. the data param is in the .bind signature as well.
[07:13:23] <DaveMethvin> that is what the little [ ] mean
[07:14:32] <guy> well, then why don't write it on(events, handler, [selector], [data])?
[07:14:59] <guy> actually, why is selector optional?
[07:15:18] <DaveMethvin> i think you need to ask in #jquery or on the forum
[07:39:53] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yt?
[07:40:04] <rwaldron> docs#10756 is not a duplicate
[07:40:05] <DaveMethvin> yep, sup?
[07:40:05] <bot-t> [#10756] file drop event dataTransfer undefined ( function(e){) - http://jqbug.com/10756
[07:40:27] <rwaldron> well, it is
[07:40:29] <DaveMethvin> well same root
[07:40:29] <rwaldron> but not of that ticket
[07:40:30] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[07:40:36] <rwaldron> and not for that reason
[07:40:49] <rwaldron> event.dataTransfer -> event.originalEvent.dataTransfer
[07:40:56] <DaveMethvin> did we take dataTransfer out?
[07:41:02] <DaveMethvin> not sure that was ever there
[07:41:05] <rwaldron> this was the whole reason I had proposed the event object hooks
[07:41:10] <rwaldron> it was
[07:41:43] <DaveMethvin> well if we  have to enumerate all the properties in separate hooks it's gonna kill us size-wise
[07:42:10] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin take a look
[07:42:10] <rwaldron> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8789
[07:42:36] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8789#comment:10
[07:42:47] <rwaldron> right
[07:42:50] <rwaldron> agreed
[07:42:58] <DaveMethvin> so are we heading down that path for backcompat reasons?
[07:43:04] <rwaldron> we're not talking about adding new props to enumerate
[07:43:09] <rwaldron> nope
[07:43:21] <rwaldron> this is when the property fix hooks would come in
[07:43:41] <DaveMethvin> you mean jQuery.event.props?
[07:43:52] <rwaldron> this is why i had them fixing where i did
[07:44:08] <rwaldron> no, I mean: this was my use case
[07:44:15] <rwaldron> but can't be achieved
[07:44:53] <rwaldron> because the event property fix hooks dont fix where I had originally set them
[07:44:59] <rwaldron> we changed the semantics completely
[07:45:48] <DaveMethvin> ok, so how did the original semantics avoid this?
[07:46:05] <DaveMethvin> example: dragenter
[07:46:32] <rwaldron> the original semantics would have allowed us to tell the ticket reporter to write an event property fix hook
[07:46:54] <rwaldron> that allowed them to copy event.originalEvent.dataTransfer to event.dataTransfer
[07:47:05] <rwaldron> meet their own needs
[07:47:05] <DaveMethvin> they don't WANT to write a hook, they want their original code to work :D
[07:47:14] <rwaldron> maybe
[07:47:23] <rwaldron> but that never worked
[07:47:29] <rwaldron> what they are asking for
[07:47:35] <DaveMethvin> sure it did in the sense that it copied their data
[07:47:41] <rwaldron> dataTransfer was _never_ on the event object
[07:47:52] <rwaldron> that was _literally_ the cause of the ticket i filed
[07:48:11] <rwaldron> it was accessible from event.originalEvent.dataTransfer
[07:48:15] <DaveMethvin> oh i thougth you said it was but i just looked at your reply
[07:48:25] <DaveMethvin> duh
[07:48:46] <DaveMethvin> ok well in that particular case the current setup works for them too
[07:48:54] <rwaldron> really?
[07:49:21] <DaveMethvin> jquery.event.fixHooks.dragenter = { props: [ "dataTransfer" ] };
[07:49:28] <DaveMethvin> doesn't taht work?
[07:49:29] <rwaldron> I thought the execution time event property fix hooks that I had written were removed
[07:49:56] <DaveMethvin> i dont think they even need the filter function
[07:50:01] <DaveMethvin> although they have one
[07:51:24] <DaveMethvin> the only tricky thing is if someone wants to extend/change an existing hook but that seems relatively rare
[07:52:02] <DaveMethvin> they'd either need to push the prop onto the mouse list for every mouse event, or copy it and assign the unique object to their new mouse fixHook
[07:53:47] <rwaldron> Cool, sorry
[07:54:00] <rwaldron> For some reason I thought that behaviour had been removed
[07:54:00] <rwaldron> http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/6AXjU/
[07:54:02] <rwaldron> works
[07:56:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah now you can attach a hook but if you just want to copy things it's easier/shorter to define props alone
[07:56:11] <DaveMethvin> but you;'re right that isn't a dup at all
[07:56:30] <DaveMethvin> they shoudl either use originalEvent (which is what i would do) or define a fixHook for the event(s)
[07:57:05] <rwaldron> I gave them the updated fiddle
[07:57:28] <rwaldron> with the useful bit for copying whatever they want from originalEvent
[07:58:10] <DaveMethvin> i am working on special events docs including fixHooks right now so we'll be able to point them to somethign specific eventuallly
[08:56:53] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: doctor it hurts when i removeProp!!!!
[08:57:22] <timmywil> hehe
[09:12:06] <ajpiano> this is actually happening in #jquery http://ajpiano.com/cap/c5fb4c.png
[09:14:41] <ajpiano> [12:14:18] <Phelps> You're all correct and I'm just an idiot (obviously the best conclusion), thanks for the great help, good day.

[13:14:00] <iPaintCode> Quit room is Quit
[13:14:48] <iPaintCode> Quiet too LOL
[13:18:23] <ajpiano> iPaintCode: you should hang around for a week and then decide whether that's true or not
[13:21:10] <iPaintCode> ajpiano: True enough
[13:21:15] <ajpiano> :)
[13:21:40] <danzik171> it is pretty quiet today though - usually a lot more goin on
[13:23:05] <iPaintCode> the few channels I loiter in have been slow lately
[13:23:11] <ajpiano> iPaintCode: but if you want to see what transpired already today http://irc.jquery.com/%23jquery-dev/%23jquery-dev_20111111.log.html :)
[13:26:39] <gnarf> its vet's day
[13:26:48] <gnarf> so people are probably enjoying their day off work
[13:26:54] <gnarf> and not lurking #jquery-dev

[13:27:12] <gnarf> DaveMethvin / timmywil: did you see that pull for docs#10750
[13:27:13] <bot-t> [#10750]  (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/10750
[13:27:27] <ajpiano> heh
[14:16:08] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: any idea what's up with bot-t: tell addyosmani
[14:16:10] <ajpiano> whoops
[14:16:13] <ajpiano> http://api.jquery.com/category/version/1.7/
[14:47:36] <eddiemonge> api.jquery.com is broked
[15:39:49] <eddiemonge> api.jquery.com is back up
[19:47:26] <DaveMethvin> hey rsilva!
[19:48:30] <rsilva> hi
[19:48:59] <rsilva> I see those instructions on how to patch bugs, and how to work with the repo
[19:49:20] <DaveMethvin> hope they help ... i saw you already answered a bunch of questions on the forum, that's a big help
[19:49:34] <DaveMethvin> you can see we get a lot of questions there
[19:51:03] <rsilva> yeah, actually I couldn't find the post a topic button for the longest time because it's up outside the main section, so I just started replying to unanswered posts
[19:51:17] <rsilva> most of the time they're unanswered for a reason though, not enough info
[19:52:06] <DaveMethvin> if you look at the bug tracker it's the same story, "doesn't work" covers a lot of ground
[19:52:18] <rsilva> anyway, I guess what I'm wondering is (a) is there a need for more developer resources, and (b) if so, how does someone typically get started -- is it just by looking over the trac database and finding a bug to fix?
[19:52:53] <rsilva> I use mercurial at the office which I think is similar to git so that shouldn't be a problem to get set up
[19:53:02] <DaveMethvin> yes there's a need for new dev resources, whether on the core code or the test environment
[19:53:25] <DaveMethvin> and yeah we use github so if you don't have an account there you'll want to spend some time getting  up to speed
[19:53:44] <rsilva> yeah I actually set up an account yesterday to host a jquery plugin I wrote
[19:53:51] <DaveMethvin> ah good
[19:54:12] <DaveMethvin> yeah the docs will help a bit but i found it took me a few mistakes before i got it right
[19:55:38] <DaveMethvin> i think a lot of us got our start by triaging bugs, it gives you a good idea of where the pain points are
[19:55:48] <DaveMethvin> are you in the boston area?
[19:55:52] <rsilva> yes
[19:56:07] <DaveMethvin> lots of the contributors are up there, many work for Bocoup
[19:56:39] <rsilva> oh I'm not familiar with them, I'll have to take a look
[19:56:46] <DaveMethvin> you mentioned you're with ibm ... in the cambridge offices? we just  had our conference up there in the royal sonesta
[19:57:01] <rsilva> yes, one of the few left in the cambridge office
[19:57:18] <rsilva> i'm in the cio lab, we do internal innovation type stuff
[19:57:43] <rsilva> I left software group last January, there I was stuck in dojo world
[19:58:37] <DaveMethvin> well you should definitely get over to Bocoup and say hi to the folks there at some point
[19:58:53] <DaveMethvin> i'm about ready to bail for the night but i just wanted to say hi and thanks for the offer
[19:59:20] <rsilva> ok thanks!
[19:59:22] <DaveMethvin> it will take a while for you to come up to speed, but dont get discouraged ...
[19:59:46] <DaveMethvin> we're generally a friendly crowd, especially for ppl who want to help!
[19:59:54] <rsilva> I'm swimming in horrible Watson code right now, so this can't be that bad...
[19:59:58] <DaveMethvin> lol
[20:00:18] <DaveMethvin> ok, goodnight
[20:00:23] <rsilva> nite
[20:21:40] <sneakyness> you should all be partying
