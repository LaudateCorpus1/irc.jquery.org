[11:49:43] <snover> leobalter: do you want me to manually verify this person?
[12:07:03] <m_gol> timmywil: ping
[12:43:09] <leobalter> snover it would help, thanks! I also wanted to open this PR to verify the 404 case on the CLA check.
[12:43:53] <leobalter> m_gol Sorry I was afk when you pinged.
[12:44:52] <m_gol> leobalter: do you still need efficient IE 6 support on BrowserStack?
[12:45:31] <m_gol> the jQuery account has 30 machines pool for automate but we also have 2 constantly on IE 6 machines because they're slow to boot up
[12:45:43] <m_gol> BrowserStack has been asking me recently if we still need them to be on
[12:46:04] <m_gol> Core no longer needs them to be so efficient as we're stopping the development of the 1.x line now
[12:46:21] <m_gol> the only other project that does anything with IE6 is QUnit, I think :)
[12:46:31] <m_gol> hence my question to you before I write to them
[12:46:45] <m_gol> (I believe you've been cc'd to the thread where we've been discussing the issue)
[12:47:23] <_JamesMGreene> Any WebStorm users know if it is possible to setup a Run Configuration such that you can set different environment variables when choosing Run vs. Debug (i.e. NODE_ENV=production vs. NODE_ENV=development)?
[12:51:01] <JamesMGreene> That's really annoying the hell out of me
[13:04:04] <snover> leobalter: what is the reason for the manual verification? person does not use their real name on internet, it is their real name, ‚Ä¶ ?

[13:26:30] <m_gol> ah, great :)
[13:26:45] <m_gol> leobalter: but you do test it on 1.x somehow, don't you?
[13:27:37] <leobalter> m_gol no, I've been neglecting it, and this is my bad. 
[13:29:28] <snover> leobalter: i need a reason to enter into the spreadsheet for the verification
[13:30:18] <leobalter> snover Kris just fixed it.
