[06:56:14] <jaubourg> :)
[06:56:56] <orkel> hope i can help make jQuery even better
[06:57:09] <jaubourg> you already did
[06:57:25] <orkel> :-)
[07:41:07] <ryanneufeld> welcome to the team orkel
[07:41:17] <orkel> thanks!
[07:41:47] <ryanneufeld> So Yandex is a search engine?
[07:43:02] <orkel> Yeap, but not only that, we like Russian version of Google :-)
[07:43:32] <ryanneufeld> ah cool, I keep seeing YandexBot in our logs, wasn't sure it was legit lol
[07:43:38] <ryanneufeld> I'll make sure we don't block it now lol
[07:43:50] <ryanneufeld> (not that we had)

[07:51:56] <jqcommit> 13jquery/06master 142ff2d1d 15Dave Methvin: Fix #12886. Fix map file reference in .min.js file....
[07:52:24] <DaveMethvin> paul_irish: Is the map support pretty solid on Chrome 32 Windows 7? I'm seeing some flakey behavior
[07:52:31] <DaveMethvin> sometimes it works, sometimes it's off by a few lines
[07:52:43] <DaveMethvin> i tried clearing cache, incantations, etc
[07:54:19] <jaubourg> does it blend?
[07:55:04] <DaveMethvin> i'm just hoping the flakiness is due to chrome and not something i did
[07:55:37] <DaveMethvin> there's a bug in uglify that makes us have to edit the map and min file after they've been generated
[07:56:58] <ryanneufeld> oh, that sucks
[07:57:56] <jaubourg> really? What is it?
[07:58:30] <DaveMethvin> the bug?
[07:58:46] <jaubourg> yep
[07:59:24] <DaveMethvin> if i uglify a  /path/to/the/file.js it hard-codes /path/to/the/file.min.js
[07:59:55] <DaveMethvin> so when we build to dist/jquery.js things break when we have the release files in some place other than dist/
[08:00:25] <DaveMethvin> really the map spec seems to have been created with ultimate flexibility in mind, which you would be crazy to use
[08:00:45] <DaveMethvin> if you rename the files the map breaks, because the map itself has to have a ref to the file name
[08:01:13] <DaveMethvin> so MY assumption is that all three files (.js, .min.js, .min.map) are in the same directory
[08:01:22] <jaubourg> makes sense
[08:01:33] <DaveMethvin> but i still can't protect against someone renaming the files and breaking the map
[08:01:50] <jaubourg> no way to cd inside the dir before invocking uglify? grunt task not that flexible maybe?
[08:02:22] <DaveMethvin> i thought about doing that but then i'd need to change all the paths before passing them to uglify
[08:02:32] <DaveMethvin> since they're relative to the main dir
[08:03:27] <jaubourg> yeah, nightmare... maybe uglify should have an option for this (--base-map-dir or something)
[08:03:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah the ticket i mentioned in the gruntfile has similar suggestions
[08:04:10] <DaveMethvin> really it might be nice for the map spec to assume things for the simplest cases
[08:05:19] <jaubourg> relative URLs have never been easy to deal with (images in css from another directory anyone?). Not sure the map spec can do much about this
[08:06:12] <DaveMethvin> if i say //@ sourceMappingURL=jquery.min.map inside jquery.min.js  it should look for jquery.js in the current directory if none is specified in the map ... or something like that
[08:06:41] <DaveMethvin> and if the file was jquery-1.9.1.map it would look for jquery-1.9.1.js  etc
[08:07:26] <DaveMethvin> i just see this naming thing becoming an issue
[08:07:51] <ryanneufeld> yeah, cause what happens when people use the google cd
[08:07:54] <ryanneufeld> *cdn?
[08:08:05] <jaubourg> I think I'll be long dead when standards acknowledge real world conventions :P
[08:08:25] <DaveMethvin> ryanneufeld: i wondered about that
[08:08:28] <ryanneufeld> <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
[08:08:35] <ryanneufeld> assuming that's the url fo rit
[08:08:43] <ryanneufeld> <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js"></script>*
[08:08:55] <ryanneufeld> how is that going to work?
[08:09:17] <DaveMethvin> the jquery CDN has unique names, so no problem for us ... same for microsoft cdn
[08:09:34] <DaveMethvin> if they're using some sort of URL redirection for renaming, the map will get lost
[08:10:02] <ryanneufeld> this is a concern
[08:10:12] <ryanneufeld> we use the google cdn for our sites
[08:10:21] <DaveMethvin> well the map is non-essential
[08:10:29] <ryanneufeld> true, but people will complain
[08:10:40] <DaveMethvin> only if they are debugging our site :D
[08:10:46] <ryanneufeld> there will be bug reports and issues DaveMethvin
[08:10:50] <ryanneufeld> BUGS AND ISSUES!!!
[08:11:17] <DaveMethvin> I CANNOT DEBUG YER SITE!
[08:11:46] <ryanneufeld> well, if it's as simple as changing the one comment
[08:11:56] <snover> base map directory won’t help for loaders that configure at runtime btw
[08:12:18] <DaveMethvin> you have to change the comment at the end of the .min.js file, also the references to the src file in the .map file
[08:12:36] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: so that could be done to generate one for google
[08:12:40] <ryanneufeld> make it a grunt task
[08:12:43] <ryanneufeld> and boom
[08:13:27] <DaveMethvin> sure, you can use a grunt task to edit all these files to make them understand the names
[08:13:32] <DaveMethvin> but it seems wrong
[08:13:55] <DaveMethvin> atm, all the source files in all the cdns have identical hashes
[08:14:02] <DaveMethvin> now the .min.js files will have unique hashes
[08:14:29] <DaveMethvin> since they have different //@ SourceMappingURL lines
[08:14:50] <ryanneufeld> that's a bummer
[08:15:05] <ryanneufeld> which CDN's are most often used?
[08:15:24] <DaveMethvin> google is the biggest i'd think
[08:18:44] <ryanneufeld> that's what I would assume as well
[08:20:57] <DaveMethvin> dog walk
[08:22:46] <scott_gonzalez> wat? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13190
[08:25:38] <tj_vantoll> Heh, kind of want to see that out of curiosity.

[16:00:59] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: you there?
[16:01:06] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: yep!
[16:01:52] <kswedberg> hey, I just noticed you asked for my feedback on a google doc. so strange. My notifications seem to happen randomly
[16:02:04] <DaveMethvin> i can't remember which one that was
[16:02:10] <DaveMethvin> i always want your feedback
[16:02:12] <DaveMethvin> :D
[16:02:13] <kswedberg> :)
[16:02:18] <kswedberg> this one : "kswedberg: if you have a few minutes i'd love to have your feedback on https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G911D-WJFmh-0h4SOJWeI6kxl4pruSHvA8M1206QNvI/edit"
[16:02:26] <kswedberg> did you write that today?
[16:02:39] <DaveMethvin> that's out the door
[16:02:49] <DaveMethvin> but i can get you more to look at
[16:03:05] <kswedberg> ah. ok. sorry about that. I would have been happy to give it a once-over. 
[16:03:11] <DaveMethvin> np, i know you're busy
[16:03:28] <kswedberg> if you have other stuff, send it my way. 
[16:03:32] <DaveMethvin> ok
[16:03:46] <kswedberg> yeah, I'm busy, like everyone else, but that's not my excuse this time. :) 
[16:04:03] <DaveMethvin> it's an excuse you could USE
[16:04:04] <kswedberg> my excuse is that I just saw the alert now.
[16:04:05] <DaveMethvin> duh
[16:04:21] <kswedberg> heh
[16:04:21] <DaveMethvin> so busy you didn't have time to see the alert
[16:04:25] <DaveMethvin> that's REALLY busy
[16:04:34] <kswedberg> I'll take it!
[16:04:46] <DaveMethvin> we have a bunch of stuff going on next week
[16:04:49] <DaveMethvin> a blog post every day
[16:05:25] <kswedberg> whoa. ok. I'd love to help
[16:05:51] <DaveMethvin> i'll remember to copy you as things develop, review as you have time
[16:06:12] <kswedberg> great!
[16:10:36] <snover> a little hitleresque there dave
[16:10:38] <snover> “hail the authors”
[16:11:49] <snover> just sayin
[16:19:03] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: is toggle() event being deprecated?
[16:19:23] <DaveMethvin> yes, it was deprecated in 1.8 and being removed in 1.9
[16:19:30] <DaveMethvin> its' in the migrate plugin tho
[16:19:44] <DaveMethvin> i think it was marked deprecated on the old api site
[16:20:06] <kswedberg> ok. I'll make sure it's marked correctly in the new site.
[16:20:10] <kswedberg> and .hover() ?
[16:20:31] <DaveMethvin> .hover() is still there but the "hover" event is not
[16:20:49] <DaveMethvin> oh i don't see the "deprecated" category on the new site at all
[16:21:23] <kswedberg> hmm. it's a category? oof. glaring omission
[16:21:37] <DaveMethvin> well it WAS a categor
[16:21:38] <DaveMethvin> y
[16:21:51] <kswedberg> mesh. and there is/was a removed category?
[16:22:00] <DaveMethvin> that i don't remember
[16:22:12] <DaveMethvin> i think we just had a comment in deprecated methods
[16:22:13] <kswedberg> *eesh
[16:23:41] <kswedberg> ok. we should probably hash out which entries we want in the deprecated category: totally deprecated or just a deprecated signature.
[16:24:11] <DaveMethvin> yeah, .toggle() is the poster child for that confusion
[16:24:57] <kswedberg> gotta run. on a call now. but can we talk later about this?
[16:25:13] <DaveMethvin> sure, i'll be around later tonight
[16:25:14] <kswedberg> also, I started a 1.9 branch for api.jquery.com
[16:25:18] <kswedberg> cool. thx
[19:28:01] <ajpiano> mikesherov: you around
[19:37:07] <ajpiano> guys i think the build is broken
[19:37:10] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin:
[19:37:18] <DaveMethvin> sup?
[19:37:27] <ajpiano> i think the build is broken for jquery core
[19:37:33] <DaveMethvin> lemme look
[19:37:34] <ajpiano> cause of the shenanigans in grunt
[19:37:45] <DaveMethvin> oh that would be bad
[19:37:58] <ajpiano> apparently ben_alman made some changes to the way multi tasks work
[19:38:10] <ajpiano> and lo and behold, it's breaking inside of a multi-task in the gruntfile
[19:38:13] <ajpiano> after a fresh clone
[19:38:48] <DaveMethvin> the last swarm job built okay
[19:39:13] <ajpiano> if you rm -rf node_modules
[19:39:15] <ajpiano> npm install
[19:39:18] <ajpiano> does it build locally?
[19:39:36] <DaveMethvin> do you think I'm CRAZY? not gonna do that
[19:39:39] <DaveMethvin> :D
[19:39:46] <DaveMethvin> mv node_modules old_modules
[19:39:50] <DaveMethvin> i'll do that :)
[19:40:04] <ajpiano> hahha
[19:40:07] <ajpiano> live dangerously
[19:41:16] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: a-yup, it's busted
[19:41:37] <DaveMethvin> Warning: Cannot read property 'dest' of undefined
[19:41:41] <ajpiano> yup
[19:41:47] <DaveMethvin> mv old_modules node_modules
[19:41:57] <DaveMethvin> RETREAT!
[19:42:34] <DaveMethvin> so how did this break? did the minor version get changed at least?
[19:42:53] <DaveMethvin> we can just change our package.json if that's the case
[19:43:00] <ajpiano> i think grunt did something silly
[19:43:15] <ajpiano> with their package versions
[19:43:22] <ajpiano> this guy blar1 is having trouble with it
[19:43:25] <ajpiano> he came into #jquery
[19:43:29] <ajpiano> but we're running into something else
[19:43:36] <ajpiano> which is that the multitask structure apparently changed
[19:43:39] <ajpiano> and he pushed a new RC
[19:43:44] <DaveMethvin> 0.4.0rc5?????????????????????????????????
[19:43:46] <ajpiano> so if you do a fresh clone
[19:43:47] <ajpiano> yea
[19:43:49] <DaveMethvin> W T F
[19:44:03] <ajpiano> hm i wonder if we just revert to 0.4rc4 it will work
[19:44:15] <DaveMethvin> i have a copy in old_modules :)
[19:44:34] <DaveMethvin> but hell, even =0.4.0 wont' protect us from this crap
[19:44:43] <ajpiano> well right that's the prob
[19:44:50] <ajpiano> we can specify 0.4.0rc4 though
[19:44:52] <ajpiano> i'm about to try that
[19:45:34] <ajpiano> hey blar1
[19:45:38] <blar1> ahoy
[19:45:44] <ajpiano> quick DaveMethvin, let's shoot the messenger
[19:45:45] <ajpiano> :p
[19:45:54] <DaveMethvin> get em, boys!
[19:45:56] <blar1> ha!
[19:46:15] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: wooooo that works
[19:46:25] <DaveMethvin> yep doin it here
[19:46:27] <blar1> anybody want npm-debug.log?
[19:46:34] <ajpiano> immediate fix is just to change package.json to 0.4.0rc4
[19:46:47] <DaveMethvin> blar1: no, we know just where the bodies are buried
[19:46:57] <ajpiano> blar1: we haven't even gotten to your dep thing yet
[19:47:04] <ajpiano> AHH
[19:47:07] <blar1> ah; no prob then
[19:47:09] <DaveMethvin> oh, interesting you still need a ~
[19:47:09] <ajpiano> so this is where the problem lies DaveMethvin
[19:47:25] <ajpiano> 		"grunt": "0.4.0rc4",
[19:47:26] <DaveMethvin> need an = i meant
[19:47:32] <ajpiano> ok it's all making sense to me
[19:47:40] <DaveMethvin> enlighten me
[19:47:50] <ajpiano> i think i'm about to dupe blar1's issue then i will 1sec
[19:48:48] <ajpiano> hmm, nope
[19:49:08] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: i think part of the problem is that apparently, to make some of the contrib plugins compatible with the change in rc5
[19:49:21] <ajpiano> they overrode the version numbers and republished
[19:49:30] <ajpiano> so like you're broken either way
[19:49:50] <DaveMethvin> NO I'M NOT I HAVE OLD_MODULES  HAHAHAHAA
[19:50:12] <DaveMethvin> i will wrap them in a moist cloth and store them in a cool dark location
[19:50:32] <DaveMethvin> of course nothing will build correctly in swarm now
[19:50:55] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: i'm trying to figure out how to update us for rc5
[19:53:31] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: if i do it with 0.4.0rc4
[19:53:36] <ajpiano> it also breaks because i'm getting
[19:53:40] <ajpiano> Running "dist:*" (dist) task
[19:53:40] <ajpiano> Warning: ENOENT, no such file or directory 'dist/jquery.min.map' Use --force to continue.
[19:54:00] <DaveMethvin> wonder why i'm not??
[19:54:11] <DaveMethvin> with the rc4 i did a clean npm install
[19:54:14] <DaveMethvin> and it built
[19:54:33] <ajpiano> odd
[19:54:46] <DaveMethvin> what version of uglify2 do you have?
[19:55:17] <DaveMethvin> hmm, what version do *I* have
[19:55:35] <ajpiano> wouldn't we both have whatever's specified
[19:55:36] <ajpiano> hm
[19:56:11] <DaveMethvin> lesse the last time someone monked with grunt-contrib-uglify
[19:56:30] <DaveMethvin> yesterday
[19:57:34] <DaveMethvin> well, heck, that only changed EVERY dependency
[20:00:07] <ben_alman> i made a boo boo
[20:00:13] <ben_alman> and published over something i shouldn't have
[20:00:15] <ben_alman> so… good times.
[20:00:26] <ben_alman> so i'm scrambling to fix it
[20:00:42] <ben_alman> anyways, afk. i'll be on tomorrow working on, you guessed it, this
[20:01:25] <ben_alman> fwiw if you can figure out what grunt commit broke everything i'll republish grunt 0.4.0rc4 as that
[20:01:32] <ajpiano> yeah we are up shit's creek right no
[20:01:37] <ajpiano> right now
[20:01:38] <ben_alman> i have no idea what went wrong
[20:01:39] <ajpiano> hmm
[20:01:57] <ajpiano> there's a bunch of custom multi tasks that i have no business mucking around with
[20:01:58] <ben_alman> nobody has pointed out a commit and said "here's where it got messed up"
[20:02:11] <ben_alman> link me your gruntfile?
[20:02:12] <DaveMethvin> well we'll just go back to the previous version that had the same version number ... :D
[20:02:13] <ajpiano> hmm
[20:02:14] <ben_alman> and package.json
[20:02:28] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/Gruntfile.js
[20:02:32] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/package.json
[20:02:43] <ben_alman> DaveMethvin: fwiw in the readme and faq i tell people to use a github url and commit sha
[20:02:50] <ben_alman> but apparently nobody did that
[20:02:58] <ben_alman> (for in-development grunt)
[20:03:19] <ben_alman> hmmn
[20:03:41] <ben_alman> yeah
[20:04:13] <ben_alman> i guess people don't like reading docs
[20:04:30] <DaveMethvin> well i just followed the pattern laid down before me
[20:04:33] <ben_alman> sure
[20:04:45] <DaveMethvin> i've never seen any file with a url and sha
[20:04:47] <ben_alman> well this has been fixed moving forward but i don't quite know how to help now
[20:04:54] <ben_alman> https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions
[20:05:00] <ben_alman> "When will I be able to use in-development feature 'X'?"
[20:05:31] <ben_alman> anyways grunt 0.4.0rc5 has been released
[20:05:48] <ben_alman> and some plugins have been published as rc5-compatible, their version numbers have rc5 in them
[20:05:59] <ben_alman> the others are all pretty much done, but haven't been published yet
[20:06:02] <ben_alman> as there are like 30 of them
[20:06:07] <ben_alman> and i need sleep
[20:06:20] <ben_alman> so i'll be working on that tomorrow, but i may very well not finish
[20:06:27] <ben_alman> until mid next week
[20:06:31] <DaveMethvin> i have a working setup squirreled away so i can continue working
[20:06:43] <ben_alman> maybe you can look @ what you have that's working
[20:06:48] <ben_alman> and see what isn't working
[20:06:55] <ben_alman> and compare version numbers
[20:07:06] <DaveMethvin> yeah i will do that tomorrow
[20:07:19] <ben_alman> if you have a working version and non-working version with the same damn version number, lmk and i will try to revert anything broken with a changed version #
[20:07:31] <ben_alman> ok, afk
[20:09:12] <ajpiano> i'm gonna try to just bisect on the local grunt
[20:12:10] <DaveMethvin> so ajpiano, if we can just find the sha for the working grunt plugins and grunt, we can wire them in
[20:12:15] <ajpiano> yeah, exactly
[20:12:21] <DaveMethvin> and we know that it was working, say, a week ago
[20:13:15] <DaveMethvin> so for example, https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify/commits/master
[20:13:27] <DaveMethvin> the dec 30 should be good
[20:13:43] <ajpiano> 'm gonna try something
[20:13:55] <DaveMethvin> i gotta go to bed, i was up early this morning but can look at this if it's still broken tomorrow
[20:14:08] <ajpiano> if i find shas that work do you want me to push?
[20:14:19] <DaveMethvin> sure, why not? i have old_modules
[20:14:21] <DaveMethvin> :D
[20:14:26] <ajpiano> heh
[20:14:27] <DaveMethvin> godspeed ajpiano
[20:14:35] <ajpiano> ok i''ll see what i can dig up
[20:21:28] <ajpiano> woohoo
[20:23:38] <blar1> success?
[20:23:56] <ajpiano> i think i have something that works
[20:24:05] <ajpiano> blar1: can you try something?
[20:24:21] <blar1> sure
[20:24:55] <ajpiano> give me a sec
[20:26:01] <ajpiano> blar1: can you rm -rf your node_modules directory in your jquery clone
[20:26:08] <ajpiano> and then make this your package.json https://gist.github.com/4507941
[20:26:12] <ajpiano> then npm install again
[20:27:04] <ajpiano> ah no it won't
[20:27:06] <ajpiano> as i suspected
[20:27:13] <ajpiano> need to find a good version of jshint too
[20:28:59] <ajpiano> yeahhhhh
[20:29:26] <ajpiano> blar1: just updated that gist
[20:29:30] <ajpiano> can you:
[20:29:34] <ajpiano> rm -rf node_modules
[20:29:36] <ajpiano> npm cache clean
[20:29:41] <ajpiano> make that file your package.json
[20:29:42] <ajpiano> npm install
[20:29:43] <ajpiano> grunt
[20:29:46] <blar1> hm, how do i use a gist file?  not familiar
[20:29:49] <ajpiano> you *should* be good
[20:29:59] <blar1> k; sec
[20:30:05] <ajpiano> just copy the contents of https://gist.github.com/raw/4507941/b4f6177d7e7ebab2eee74f33fe043b23d1717979/gistfile1.txt
[20:30:07] <ajpiano> into your package.json
[20:30:10] <blar1> fair nuff
[20:30:12] <ajpiano> over what's already there
[20:31:41] <blar1> hrm; "no compatible version found: grunt-cli@'>=0.1.0- <0.2.0-'"
[20:32:52] <ajpiano> anyonehmm
[20:34:08] <ajpiano> blar1: i assume you did npm install -g grunt-cli at some point along the line here?
[20:34:29] <blar1> tried that; can't even build grunt from source at this point
[20:34:40] <blar1> 'npm install grunt-cli' fails too
[20:34:42] <ajpiano> right, but you just did that earlier tonight, right?
[20:34:53] <blar1> and again a few minutes ago
[20:34:58] <ajpiano> oh man now that's just strange
[20:35:31] <blar1> npm is telling me there isn't even a 'grunt-cli' package, if i understand it right
[20:35:49] <blar1> well, "no compatible version"
[20:35:59] <ajpiano> there definitely is, and the current one is 1.6, which is in that range
[20:36:27] <ajpiano> but i don't know what's wrong
[20:36:48] <ajpiano> did you do the npm cache clean
[20:36:53] <blar1> yes
[20:37:20] <ajpiano> so if you do grunt -version in the jquery repo, it just blows up?
[20:37:46] <blar1> "grunt v0.3.17"
[20:37:59] <ajpiano> ah well that is definitely not a good sign
[20:38:11] <ajpiano> can you rm -rf node_modules again
[20:38:28] <blar1> i'm not seeing a 'node_modules' dir
[20:38:36] <blar1> should it be in the jquery dir?
[20:38:58] <ajpiano> oh hm
[20:39:09] <ajpiano> do you have an old grunt installed globally
[20:39:29] <blar1> i do; but i can't even build grunt right now, so i can't replace it
[20:39:30] <ajpiano> can you "npm rm -g grunt"
[20:39:37] <blar1> ah, sure
[20:40:08] <ajpiano> and also grunt-cli, for good measure :p
[20:40:38] <blar1> k; tried rm'ing grunt-cli and it wasn't even installed
[20:40:42] <ajpiano> ok
[20:41:01] <ajpiano> what happens if you "npm install -g grunt-cli" right now
[20:41:26] <blar1> "no compatible version found: grunt-cli"
[20:41:35] <blar1> "no valid targets found"
[20:42:03] <ajpiano> are you inside of the jquery clone dir? can you do it from outside?
[20:42:12] <blar1> ah yes, and yes
[20:42:13] <blar1> sec
[20:42:53] <blar1> same failure; "no compatible version found"
[20:43:09] <ajpiano> that makes no sense :/
[20:43:17] <shoky> hey
[20:43:33] <ajpiano> blar1: what version of node are you using
[20:43:36] <shoky> i did pretty much what you told blar1 to do, and it built fine here
[20:43:51] <blar1> just cloned
[20:44:05] <ajpiano> can you do node -v
[20:44:16] <blar1> 0.6.18
[20:44:16] <ajpiano> shoky: ok, that is reassuring
[20:44:21] <ajpiano> blar1: yuppppp
[20:44:23] <ajpiano> there's your problem
[20:44:27] <ajpiano> that is definitely not the latest node :p
[20:44:32] <blar1> ah ha
[20:44:45] <ajpiano> latest node is 0.8.17
[20:45:15] <ajpiano> alright i'm gonna try pushing up these shas
[20:45:21] <ajpiano> blar1: upgrade your node
[20:45:31] <ajpiano> and then hopefully when that's done you'll be able to build with a fresh clone of jquery
[20:45:48] <blar1> argh; sorry bout all that
[20:45:54] <ajpiano> blar1: no it's fine
[20:46:08] <ajpiano> we wouldn't have even known how screwed we were had you not reported it
[20:48:04] <ajpiano> well, there goes me committing on jquery master
[20:48:36] <jqcommit> 01[13jquery01] 15ajpiano pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/Hgs5KQ

[20:49:08] * shoky applauds
[20:53:36] <ajpiano> shoky: if you throw everything away locally and pull, i assume this builds for you a-ok?
[20:54:27] <shoky> sec
[20:56:14] <shoky> yeap
