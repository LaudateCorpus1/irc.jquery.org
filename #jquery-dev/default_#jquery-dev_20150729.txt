[10:35:14] <kadamwhite> timmywil: scott_gonzalez: gnarf said you might be able to answer a Q I had about the jQuery release process: p5.js is struggling with how to release their built code to NPM & Bower without including it in the dev repo.
[10:35:33] <kadamwhite> I've looked through the jQuery release code very cursorily, but I'm not sure I grok the order of operations or where everything lives
[10:36:01] <scott_gonzalez> The approach core is going to use for the next release is to push just the built files to a separate repo.
[10:36:12] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-dist
[10:37:07] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not really sure why the src directory exists there. timmywil?
[10:37:35] <arschmitz> kadamwhite: the previous process was just to tag on a detached head
[10:38:32] <arschmitz> kadamwhite: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/2.1.4
[10:39:22] <kadamwhite> arschmitz: scott_gonzalez: that explains some of my confusion, I was seeing evidence of both processes. What were the weaknesses of the detached head strategy, that the new one was adopted?
[10:39:23] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: it exists because we want to publish our AMD modules, some people may want to use them directly
[10:39:59] <m_gol> kadamwhite: we have a separate repo now since we changed the version strategy: both jQuery & jQuery Compat will have version 3.0.0 so they cannot be tagged from the same repo
[10:40:25] <kadamwhite> ahh makes sense. Which one will live in the new repo, jQuery proper?
[10:40:29] <m_gol> kadamwhite: but the detached head strategy has another weakness - it increases repo size as the built files need to be added to every tag. it also makes the whole process more complicated
[10:40:53] <m_gol> kadamwhite: jQuery is on the master branch, jQuery Compat on the compat branch. Both will be published from separate repos now
[10:41:10] <m_gol> it would be simpler if we just published to npm as it doesn't need this detached tag madness
[10:41:17] <m_gol> and tags
[10:41:30] <kadamwhite> hmm. m_gol how does npm work without the detached head? Don't you need to build the file anyway?
[10:41:40] * kadamwhite is kinda a release newb
[10:41:53] <scott_gonzalez> npm doesn't care about git.
[10:41:54] <m_gol> kadamwhite: npm is not tied to the repo, it just publishes what you tell it to
[10:42:07] <scott_gonzalez> So you can do a release from any directory.
[10:42:07] <m_gol> so you can generate files into dist, they can be in gitignore, doesn't matter
[10:42:20] <kadamwhite> ah, so you can build and then it'll just pick up the generated files
[10:42:22] <kadamwhite> that makes sense!
[10:42:22] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[10:42:28] <scott_gonzalez> Bower, on the other hand, is directly tied to the repo.
[10:42:37] * kadamwhite nods
[10:47:23] <kadamwhite> Do you see any reason why p5.js shouldn't pursue the detached head process, at least for now? We don't have the compat/latest split
[10:52:11] <m_gol> kadamwhite: apart from the split, I remember only this other reason, that it increases the repo size on each release. And that you need to be careful about tagging. Other than that, it should be fine.
[10:54:55] <kadamwhite> m_gol: thanks, that's helpful.
[10:55:17] <kadamwhite> scott_gonzalez: m_gol: arschmitz: I really appreciate your sharing your perspective! Thank you all.
[10:55:43] <scott_gonzalez> No problem.
[10:55:45] <arschmitz> kadamwhite: your welcome. 
[10:56:16] <kadamwhite> Do any of you mind if I post this conversation verbatim on the p5 github issue related to our bower woes?
[10:57:08] <arschmitz> kadamwhite: might be easier to post a link http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-dev/default_%23jquery-dev_20150729.log.html#t10:35:14
[10:57:59] <kadamwhite> y'all have all the best tools :) Useful!

[13:22:22] <m_gol> We seem to have a lot of angry reporters recently. And I'm not talking about those spammy issues from quickly banned accounts.
[13:26:03] <snover> well it is not the easiest time to develop for web platform
[13:26:10] <snover> or to be alive
[13:26:25] <snover> sometimes it just makes you angry!!
[13:26:27] <snover> grr. grr.
[13:26:38] <DaveMethvin> considering the alternative, it's not bad
[13:26:50] <DaveMethvin> it seems some people want us to debug everything for them
[13:27:28] <snover> you know i do dave
[13:27:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah, you bum
[13:27:51] <snover> please debug this burrito i am eating, it has fewer beans than usual
[13:27:55] <snover> could be a bug
[13:28:09] <DaveMethvin> have you checked with Taco Bell?
[13:29:03] <snover> i can try but they arenâ€™t the vendor
[13:29:20] <snover> i donâ€™t know why you couldnâ€™t read my mind to know that
[13:29:28] <DaveMethvin> even better, take your burrito there and they can help
[13:29:38] <DaveMethvin> they're great at third-party burritos
[13:29:58] <DaveMethvin> maybe they can do a sauce review
[13:30:12] <snover> booooooooom!
