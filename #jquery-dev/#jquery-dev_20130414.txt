[13:12:38] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you there?
[13:12:58] <mikesherov> focus and blurâ€¦ are they both async in IE?
[13:13:05] <mikesherov> or is only blur?
[13:13:50] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov i can't remember, seems like it may only be blur
[13:13:56] <DaveMethvin> i remember it being strange
[13:14:46] <mikesherov> OK, and there's also weirdness in FF where you can't call blur from a focus handler, and there's the whole you can't <DOMElement>.focus() twice in IE8?
[13:15:25] <DaveMethvin> from memory, there's an issue in ff with trying to focus an element if the browser itself isn't focused
[13:15:29] <mikesherov> I have the fun job of making sure jQuery UI unit tests that work on blur and focus work all the way back to jQuery 1.6
[13:16:16] <mikesherov> I've ended up with something crazy
[13:17:04] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: https://gist.github.com/mikesherov/5384039
[13:17:15] <DaveMethvin> i solved a bunch of problems by using the real DOM focus method ... but created an equal pile of different problems
[13:17:29] <mikesherov> yeah, I use the real .focus() method
[13:17:38] <mikesherov> but I create a new element to focus each time
[13:18:03] <mikesherov> and then I attach a focus listener that ignores the event if it doesn't have event.originalEvent present
[13:18:19] <mikesherov> soâ€¦. that's fun
[13:18:47] <mikesherov> but it's only blur that's async, from memory?
[13:19:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i think the unit tests in core may be set for a worst case scenario where both are async
[13:19:25] <DaveMethvin> but i seem to recall only seeing blur be async
[13:19:37] <mikesherov> ok, great, thanks a million
[13:19:41] <DaveMethvin> and it may only be sometimes async
[13:21:04] <mikesherov> ok, as long as I can count on a sync focus, I'm good
[18:24:04] <JamesMGreene> Random question but: any of you know anything about electrical wiring?
[18:26:10] <JamesMGreene> Trying to figure out what ramifications there will be if a replace a axial fan with a "rated current (A)" of "0.24A" with one of "0.12A"
[18:39:08] <snover> the ramifications would be a burn-out/explosion
[18:39:37] <snover> or maybe nothing if it was never actually driven over 0.12A
[22:06:33] <JamesMGreene> snover: btw, the wall plug for the power supply to the fan says its max its 0.11A, so I'm thinking my current 0.24A fan is only getting 0.11A of energy anyway
[22:07:08] <JamesMGreene> Which theoretically means that a 0.12A fan would work with basically the exact same efficiency, AFAIK
