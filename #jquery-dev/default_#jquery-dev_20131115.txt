[06:23:45] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: ping
[06:23:57] <DaveMethvin> hey timmywil
[06:24:37] <timmywil> So I think my idea will work, but I'm at a loss when it comes to avoiding the removal of the archives during npm publish.
[06:24:53] <timmywil> in other words, everything seems to work up until npm publish
[06:25:02] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[06:25:20] <DaveMethvin> exactly when does /dist disappear?
[06:25:27] <DaveMethvin> what command does it?
[06:25:38] <timmywil> well, I mean, after the changes I have locally
[06:26:11] <timmywil> want to skype?

[06:56:52] <m_gol> \o/
[06:57:35] <DaveMethvin> files don't seem to be updated in the cache ... now did i need to do something there? let me check notes
[06:58:10] <m_gol> tag wasn't created
[06:58:31] <scott_gonzalez> Where are there specific files listed under /dist?
[06:58:40] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't /dist alone catch all of them?
[06:58:56] <scott_gonzalez> s/Where/Why/
[06:58:58] <timmywil> m_gol: yes it was
[06:59:14] <timmywil> but neither of those commits are the tag
[06:59:23] <m_gol> ah, right
[06:59:27] <DaveMethvin> detached head
[07:00:12] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: did you hit any errors?
[07:00:20] <DaveMethvin> timmywil nope
[07:00:24] <timmywil> cool :)
[07:00:51] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez /dist may have other files
[07:00:57] <m_gol> well, I still don't see the tag... is it on the main repo or somewhere completely separate?
[07:00:59] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're talking about, but no, not all /dist files should be committed
[07:01:15] <timmywil> m_gol: look under releases
[07:01:17] <m_gol> git fetch -p; git checkout 2.1.0-beta2 # nothing
[07:01:42] <timmywil> m_gol: git fetch upstream --tags
[07:02:03] <m_gol> ah, there it is
[07:02:30] <m_gol> I guess a detached tag gets not fetched automatically as non-detached ones
[07:03:16] <DaveMethvin> hmm timmywil the commit for the release looks mighty ugly
[07:03:41] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/a7b6679be29569a009f41c356f515a339f499169
[07:03:42] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: Dave Methvin (8m 26s ago): 2.1.0-beta2
[07:03:43] <timmywil> as the doctor would say, don't look at that
[07:03:47] <DaveMethvin> lol
[07:04:23] <DaveMethvin> gotta hide it under a second commit that looks like https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/1185427c4c35ea57e3634ca735422e23d2e55751 :)
[07:04:23] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: Dave Methvin (1mon 3w ago): Tagging the 2.1.0-beta1 release.
[07:04:29] <m_gol> :)
[07:04:34] <DaveMethvin> nobody will know then!
[07:04:44] <timmywil> oh, you know what, that's doable
[07:04:47] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[07:04:49] <timmywil> next time
[07:04:53] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: I'm referring to lines 9-11 https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1436/files#diff-a084b794bc0759e7a6b77810e01874f2R9
[07:04:53] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Pull request #1436 by mzgol (8m 43s ago): Use absolute paths in .gitignore.
[07:04:55] <DaveMethvin> that's what betas are for
[07:05:24] <timmywil> ohh, the gitignore
[07:05:35] <m_gol> right
[07:05:42] <m_gol> that should catch'em all
[07:05:46] <timmywil> yea I would just ignore the whole dist folder
[07:06:00] <timmywil> oh, which you are
[07:06:17] <timmywil> didn't you you have to specify dotfiles separately
[07:06:23] <scott_gonzalez> Why is so much stuff getting deleted?
[07:06:34] <scott_gonzalez> You're going to make the repo grow pretty quickly like that, won't you?
[07:08:17] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez timmywil: yeah... Can't it be fixed by creating .npmignore and whatever bower uses?
[07:09:13] <DaveMethvin> oh .npmignore may be just what we need
[07:09:50] <timmywil> yea, we could do .npmignore.
[07:10:28] <timmywil> we might just be able to keep it to one commit that way
[07:10:31] <scott_gonzalez> The deletion is actually really bad.
[07:10:34] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez on the process of getting files to the cdn, i did it once for 1.10.2 but didn't update my notes
[07:10:36] <scott_gonzalez> It's impossible to run tests aginst this tag now.
[07:10:54] <scott_gonzalez> And your'e going to get a dirty try by checking out the tag, right?
[07:11:00] <scott_gonzalez> Since you deleted the .gitignore.
[07:11:12] <scott_gonzalez> You also can't properly lint the tag.
[07:11:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah so we'll do .npmignore next time
[07:11:44] <DaveMethvin> it's a beta
[07:12:18] <m_gol> IMO npm automatically excludes .gitignore from packages
[07:12:21] <m_gol> no need to remove it
[07:12:40] <scott_gonzalez> NPM uses .gitignore as the .npmignore if .npmignore doesn't exist.
[07:13:01] <timmywil> normally ignored files need to be committed. It was easiest to remove it and control what was present in the tag.
[07:13:19] <scott_gonzalez> You should be able to explicitly commit files that are ignored.
[07:14:12] <m_gol> that's true, I did it multiple times by accident
[07:14:33] <timmywil> you'd have to use force, I believe, which I suppose is not that bad
[07:15:52] <m_gol> I guess it's much better than creating a huge diff :)
[07:15:56] <m_gol> esp. in a detached HEAD
[07:17:35] <DaveMethvin> is npmjs.org down?
[07:17:37] <m_gol> this commit weighs 2.1 MB before compression or whatever git does with it
[07:18:01] <m_gol> yeah, can't get to it either
[07:20:32] <m_gol> what a timing...
[07:23:44] <timmywil> https://github.com/timmywil/jquery/commit/b38e4dbadfe4063eb194dfed074aecdb5b76c16d
[07:23:44] <b-ot> timmywil: Timmy Willison (21s ago): Release script: Add .npmignore and keep .gitignore when creating the tag
[07:24:14] <DaveMethvin> timmywil if you want i can use this updated script for the 1.11 beta release
[07:25:01] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: ah, good idea
[07:25:19] <m_gol> I put a comment
[07:25:48] <timmywil> actually, adding the readme is pointless too
[07:25:54] <m_gol> so it's too late to re-tag 2.1.0-beta2?
[07:25:57] <timmywil> adding it to the ignore that is
[07:26:07] <DaveMethvin> is it really necessary to re-tag?
[07:26:09] <timmywil> i dunno, we usually frown upon that
[07:26:14] <DaveMethvin> it's a beta
[07:26:28] <m_gol> I know, it's just this 2.1 MB seems kinda large :)
[07:26:29] <DaveMethvin> we'll have the 1.11 beta tag with the updated approach
[07:27:00] <DaveMethvin> to a small delta, nobody is going to look at this
[07:27:58] <m_gol> except when cloning the repo
[07:28:11] <m_gol> I don't know what real footprint it leaves, though
[07:28:18] <m_gol> it's compressed somehow I guess
[07:28:27] <timmywil> I don't think it affects npm download time
[07:28:43] <m_gol> yeah, I'm mostly concerned about cloning the repo
[07:28:49] <m_gol> npm package will be fine
[07:29:14] <timmywil> well, I'd be happy to replace the tag
[07:29:26] <m_gol> gzipped it's 588 KB from 2.1 MB
[07:30:16] <DaveMethvin> it's not pushed to npm yet either ... we could change it
[07:30:18] <timmywil> This was a rush job for the beta release. I should have thought of the .npmignore.
[07:31:02] <m_gol> I vote for changing since we haven't published yet
[07:31:14] <m_gol> if we did, it'd be much harder to justify it
[07:31:32] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: shall I do the honors? We'll leave everything else unchanged.
[07:31:39] <m_gol> timmywil: what do you think? https://github.com/timmywil/jquery/commit/b38e4dbadfe4063eb194dfed074aecdb5b76c16d#commitcomment-4613713

[07:32:54] <m_gol> .gitignore will not be included anyway so my PR can wait for until the beta

[07:41:48] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, m_gol, scott_gonzalez: ^^
[07:42:09] <timmywil> sizzle added in a previous headless commit
[07:43:02] <DaveMethvin> timmywil squeaky clean
[07:44:25] <m_gol> +1
[07:50:40] <m_gol> npmjs.org is down but npm works
[07:50:51] <m_gol> hm, should we publish it as a canary build?
[07:51:09] <timmywil> we'll publish with the beta tag
[07:51:11] <DaveMethvin> yes or whatever they use for beta
[07:51:16] <timmywil> as in npm publish --tag beta
[07:51:50] <m_gol> yup
[07:52:23] <DaveMethvin> hmm, so the cdn stuff i have in there is obsolete now i guess
[07:52:38] <m_gol> btw
[07:52:42] <DaveMethvin> i have to commit to the codeorigin repo
[07:52:58] <m_gol> do we want to have the source map comment in the version published to bower & npm?
[07:52:58] <DaveMethvin> wonder where those copied files are going ... :/
[07:53:17] <DaveMethvin> m_gol i dunno, prob not?
[07:53:27] <m_gol> bc now they're there :)
[07:53:32] <m_gol> but maybe that's not a problem
[07:53:44] <DaveMethvin> it's not a "problem" but i dunno if that's what we want
[07:53:48] <m_gol> a problem is people copying minified files without the map or source from a CDN
[07:53:59] <m_gol> which doesn't apply to bower & npm
[07:54:19] <timmywil> I think it's fine for the beta
[07:54:22] <m_gol> we also keep the comment for manual compilation, i.e. outside of release scripts if you just run `grunt`
[07:54:30] <timmywil> we should discuss it more for the final release
[07:54:33] <m_gol> so yeah, we might leave it there
[07:54:34] <m_gol> yup
[07:55:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah and it's not in our cdn copy
[07:55:19] <DaveMethvin> okay so where are we now?
[07:55:31] <timmywil> If we're cool with the tag, I can push it
[07:55:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[07:55:50] <DaveMethvin> i need to run release on 1.11 beta
[07:55:56] <DaveMethvin> and push the cdn files up

[07:59:44] <timmywil> woo!
[07:59:47] <timmywil> that looks like a thing
[07:59:49] <DaveMethvin> timmywil was there already a tag for beta2?
[07:59:55] <DaveMethvin> i think i may  need to force push
[08:00:01] <m_gol> timmywil removed it
[08:00:07] <m_gol> so it should be fine
[08:00:20] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: wait, are you talking about 1.11.0?
[08:00:21] <m_gol> unless you already have a local copy ]:->
[08:00:23] <DaveMethvin> oic the problem, i had the local 2.1.0-beta2 tag before timmywil pushed it
[08:00:25] <timmywil> it was just created
[08:00:33] <timmywil> ah, right
[08:00:36] <m_gol> so you can just remove the local one :)
[08:00:36] <DaveMethvin> so i'll just delete mine and pull yours
[08:01:00] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: stop repeating me! ;)
[08:01:53] <m_gol> aaaahhh
[08:02:00] <m_gol> the tag got mangled
[08:02:04] <m_gol> I mean
[08:02:06] <m_gol> the version
[08:02:14] <m_gol> it's 2.1.0-pre
[08:02:22] <m_gol> and not -beta2
[08:02:28] <m_gol> timmywil DaveMethvin ^^^
[08:02:42] <DaveMethvin> oh that's not good
[08:02:53] <DaveMethvin> but fixable
[08:03:06] <timmywil> is 1.11.0 ok?
[08:03:10] <timmywil> yea seems so
[08:03:19] <DaveMethvin> you mean the 2.1.0 tag is pointing to pre?
[08:03:20] <timmywil> ugh
[08:03:52] <m_gol> yes
[08:04:07] <m_gol> in package.json, in jquery.js/.min.js
[08:04:09] <m_gol> etc.
[08:04:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'd need to run the build script again
[08:04:27] <m_gol> crap, should've noticed that earlier
[08:04:37] <DaveMethvin> so perhaps we just punt on this for this beta?
[08:04:44] <DaveMethvin> we learned a LOT :)
[08:04:51] <m_gol> the problem is we can't really publish this to npm in this shape
[08:04:55] <m_gol> with mangled package.json
[08:04:56] <DaveMethvin> right
[08:04:59] <DaveMethvin> so we don't
[08:05:01] <m_gol> since it takes the version out of that
[08:05:05] <m_gol> ah, ok
[08:05:09] <m_gol> I guess that's an option ;)
[08:05:46] <timmywil> man, npm is janky right now
[08:05:52] <scott_gonzalez> Is one of the things that you learned that you shouldn't start building complex release scripts from scratch?
[08:05:55] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[08:06:25] <DaveMethvin> it wasn't from scratch, just some complex additions
[08:06:31] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[08:06:42] <DaveMethvin> and unfortunately release scripts are a bear to test
[08:06:46] <DaveMethvin> no matter what
[08:06:47] <scott_gonzalez> Don't worry, the third iteration of the UI release script will work for all projects :-)
[08:06:58] <scott_gonzalez> The UI release script is actually very easy to test.
[08:07:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah we'll just copy yours and s/ UI//g
[08:08:15] <DaveMethvin> ok what does everyone think?
[08:08:22] <DaveMethvin> we could publish 1.11 to npm i suppose
[08:08:49] <m_gol> will it work?
[08:08:58] <m_gol> we were working on an assumption we don't publish 1.x
[08:09:04] <m_gol> so I'm not sure
[08:09:12] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah what am i saying?
[08:09:15] <DaveMethvin> just 2.x for npm
[08:09:21] <DaveMethvin> bower gets both
[08:09:29] <DaveMethvin> resetting everything and/or hacking it enough to republish 2.1 seems like a lot of work
[08:09:41] <DaveMethvin> let
[08:09:57] <timmywil> well, it would actually be easy. I just feel terrible having to build it again.
[08:10:33] <DaveMethvin> well i wouldn't want to blow off the existing commits
[08:10:49] <timmywil> no, just the tag
[08:11:19] <DaveMethvin> if you want to give it a run timmywil i'm okay with it
[08:11:20] <gibson042> let's just jump to beta20 and call it *really* well-tested ;)
[08:11:27] <m_gol> hahaha
[08:11:35] <DaveMethvin> beta 2.00001
[08:11:37] <timmywil> hehe
[08:11:53] <gibson042> and break everyone's poorly-implemented semver parsing to boot!
[08:12:03] <m_gol> I know noise is bad but it would be great to be able to collect feedback about our npm package before the final version ships
[08:12:23] <m_gol> gibson042: well, actually, I don't think we're following semver here :)
[08:12:30] <m_gol> it should be 2.1.0-beta.2
[08:12:33] <DaveMethvin> that is a good point m_gol, we should have the npm guys look at it
[08:12:39] <gibson042> lol, you're right
[08:12:48] <gibson042> we don't even have the window dressing for this one
[08:13:09] <m_gol> that was the assumption
[08:13:14] <m_gol> that it's provided from outside
[08:13:15] <timmywil> https://github.com/timmywil/jquery/commit/92368a0c5c493fcb08add0640a32b9c6c072e731
[08:13:15] <b-ot> timmywil: Timmy Willison (35s ago): 2.1.0-beta2
[08:13:22] <m_gol> bc it's not always needed, e.g. in browserify case
[08:14:04] <DaveMethvin> okay, that shows -beta2
[08:14:22] <timmywil> sorry for the mess guys
[08:14:28] <DaveMethvin> i've done worse
[08:15:05] <m_gol> yeah, much better :)
[08:15:32] <snover> m_gol: there is no semver requirement like what you just said
[08:16:18] <m_gol> snover: does semver say which prerelease is newer? e.g. 2.1.0-beta2 or 2.1.0-beta20?
[08:16:31] <gibson042> yes
[08:16:32] <snover> yes
[08:16:39] <m_gol> ah, ok, so we're ok
[08:16:54] <gibson042> alphabetic comparison "beta2" vs. "beta20"
[08:17:09] <DaveMethvin> if we get to beta10 we're doin it rong
[08:17:13] <m_gol> :)
[08:17:34] <snover> the reason you would want to use a dot would be if you planned on actually having more than 9 betas
[08:17:35] <m_gol> then we start rc and end on rc8
[08:17:55] <m_gol> snover: I guess that's not alywas a planned thing :)
[08:18:01] <m_gol> * always
[08:18:08] <DaveMethvin> then we make major api changes on rc5
[08:18:14] <DaveMethvin> oh wait, grunt already did it
[08:18:17] <m_gol> don't tell me about it
[08:18:30] <m_gol> Angular introduced 4 breaking changes between 1.2.0-rc.3 and 1.2.0
[08:18:40] <m_gol> and backed one of it in 1.2.1
[08:18:46] <m_gol> * one of them
[08:22:37] <jqcommit> 01[13jquery01] 15timmywil 04deleted 062.1.0-beta2 at 14416e8ce: 02http://git.io/bjvfqQ
[08:23:32] <timmywil> well, jqcommit didn't say it, but it's there
[08:24:04] <timmywil> I also did an npm publish test to jquery-temp
[08:24:09] <timmywil> DaveMethvin
[08:24:15] <DaveMethvin> yep
[08:24:27] <DaveMethvin> sure wish npmjs.org wasn't down
[08:24:40] <timmywil> agreed
[08:24:50] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: but you can npm i jquery-temp to see the package
[08:26:59] <DaveMethvin> temp looks good timmywil
[08:27:28] <timmywil> I forgot to git clean before npm publish, which is why qunit and requirejs are in bower_modules, but that won't happen for the real publish
[08:27:44] <m_gol> LGTM
[08:27:46] <DaveMethvin> and if it's not good the node folks will be SURE to tell us
[08:27:54] <m_gol> maybe it's not worth publishing qunit
[08:27:59] <m_gol> but that's nothing major
[08:28:03] <m_gol> ah
[08:28:05] <m_gol> lol
[08:28:09] <m_gol> should read that before :)
[08:28:30] <m_gol> I'm sure Domenic will rush to test it ;)
[08:28:34] <DaveMethvin> keep up m_gol! :)
[08:28:57] <DaveMethvin> yeah m_gol can you post on the npm issue letting them know to test?
[08:29:01] <m_gol> sure
[08:29:05] <timmywil> which email should I use for jquery?
[08:29:10] <m_gol> I have the tab open just for that reason ;)
[08:29:13] <DaveMethvin> i wondered that
[08:29:24] <DaveMethvin> how is it used in npm?
[08:29:28] <timmywil> I believe there's an npm@jquery.org
[08:29:31] <timmywil> that right?
[08:29:40] <DaveMethvin> oh maybe rwaldron created that
[08:29:43] <DaveMethvin> if so that would be ideal
[08:29:51] <DaveMethvin> assuming it goes SOMEWHERE 
[08:30:14] <m_gol> haha
[08:30:23] <m_gol>  /dev/null is a place as well...
[08:30:34] <timmywil> i could tell what it's supposed to be if stupid npmjs.org wasn't down
[08:30:46] <m_gol> ha! it's up!
[08:30:56] <timmywil> lol
[08:31:05] <timmywil> oh, right, npm info jquery, derp
[08:31:26] <timmywil> uh, no
[08:31:28] <timmywil> not in there
[08:31:51] <DaveMethvin> https://npmjs.org/package/jquery readme needs work
[08:32:09] <timmywil> heh, it's set to your email dave
[08:32:24] <timmywil> https://npmjs.org/~jquery
[08:32:47] <timmywil> your beautiful avatar
[08:32:50] <DaveMethvin> gotta run for a while, back in about 25 minutes and i'll publish the blog post if all looks well
[08:32:58] <DaveMethvin> files are up on the cdn now
[08:36:05] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, m_gol jquery beta now on npm
[08:37:09] <timmywil> whew, mission accomplished
[08:40:24] <m_gol> timmywil: \o/
[08:55:41] <m_gol> DaveMethvin timmywil: what do we do with the jQuery package?
[08:56:00] <m_gol> DaveMethvin timmywil: I mean literally "jQuery", not "jquery"
[08:56:06] <m_gol> https://npmjs.org/package/jQuery
[08:57:15] <timmywil> We probably need to get the jquery user as the sole maintainer of that project. then we can publish to both.
[08:57:41] <timmywil> As I understand it, AJ had already agreed to pass it along
[08:58:18] <timmywil> but I wouldn't say it's a rush until final release
[08:58:22] <m_gol> rwaldron is one of maintainers, I just wonder if we should publish to both as that is duplication & noise
[08:58:26] <m_gol> yeah, agreed
[08:59:10] <timmywil> it would be worth noting in the blog post that jquery should be used to test the beta on npm
[09:02:52] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[09:04:11] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: together with the info it won't work standalone in node ;)
[09:05:01] <DaveMethvin> so what do we need to do to have this make sense?
[09:06:14] <DaveMethvin> i see domenic's tickets, that's good ... we can fix in beta 3
[09:09:28] <m_gol> ha, that was quick
[09:10:24] <DaveMethvin> but we went round about this before ... what happens when there is no `window`? We're kinda screwed
[09:10:40] <DaveMethvin> and window is not always the same as global
[09:10:49] <DaveMethvin> i forget all the issues there, we have a ticket about it
[09:11:34] <timmywil> It may suffice to use the global window if present and skip the factory.
[09:11:45] <timmywil> or rather, execute the factory immediately
[09:12:22] <m_gol> what scenario was this factory meant to support?
[09:12:29] <timmywil> the issue there was using jQuery in an environment that doesn't have a window.
[09:12:38] <timmywil> it would simply error and you were screwed
[09:12:53] <snover> why would you ever do that‚Ä¶
[09:12:56] <m_gol> but what can you do without a window anyway?
[09:12:59] <timmywil> the point was to require a window be created (with jsdom or similar)
[09:13:13] <timmywil> and pass that into the factory and everything would then work
[09:13:38] <timmywil> it solves that issue, but I imagine using CommonJS in the browser will be our more common use case
[09:13:41] <m_gol> ah, right
[09:13:55] <m_gol> so that you'd use require('jquery')(myCustomWindow)
[09:15:59] <m_gol> but then it will be weird that we'll get a completely different thing if window is already present
[09:16:14] <m_gol> so it seems this whole factory mechanism needs to go away then
[09:16:46] <DaveMethvin> so we're back to requiring a global variable named window that is defined before we are loaded?
[09:17:11] <DaveMethvin> sorry to change the subject, but https://npmjs.org/package/jquery readme is not applicable
[09:17:25] <DaveMethvin> better to have it empty i suspect
[09:18:20] <timmywil> yea, there's no way to ignore the README, so maybe we want to place the build info and stuff elsewhere
[09:18:41] <timmywil> m_gol: I don't think anyone will complain if it works in the browser
[09:18:46] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: do you see 2.1.0-beta2 there? I still see 1.8.3
[09:18:58] <timmywil> still seems like a cleaner solution when using it with something like jsdom
[09:18:59] <DaveMethvin> does it show betas?
[09:19:05] <timmywil> it does not
[09:19:16] <m_gol> :)
[09:19:43] <DaveMethvin> homepage, bugs, dependencies entries on that page are also wrong
[09:19:47] <m_gol> can you force-show it with some get parameter?
[09:20:08] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: those will respect our package.json entries for the final release
[09:20:28] <DaveMethvin> oic, yeah, same problem
[09:20:34] <DaveMethvin> i had better explain this in the blog entry 
[09:20:44] <m_gol> yeah :D
[09:20:52] <m_gol> the first line in this readme is the best
[09:21:05] <m_gol> the most important feature of the jquery package
[09:21:12] <m_gol> "DOES NOT WORK ON WINDOWS"
[09:21:35] <DaveMethvin> i really don't even want to point people to this page
[09:21:42] <DaveMethvin> it's just gonna confuse them
[09:22:22] <timmywil> there must be a way to view it, searching...
[09:22:43] <m_gol> hm
[09:23:03] <m_gol> we could publish a stable 1.8.3.1 package that just has the readme changed
[09:23:12] <m_gol> to point the future change etc.
[09:23:29] <m_gol> from the coolay86 repo
[09:24:10] <DaveMethvin> http://blog.jquery.com/?p=3123&preview=true&preview_id=3123&public=1&nonce=bf4c99f09d
[09:24:21] <DaveMethvin> take a look and see if anything looks screwy
[09:29:06] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: seems fine modulo the confusing link
[09:29:17] <m_gol> What do you think about this 1.8.3.1 idea?
[09:29:30] <DaveMethvin> yeah imma use https://t.co/aTukZVrrQI
[09:29:44] <DaveMethvin> well, https://npmjs.org/package/jquery/2.1.0-beta2
[09:29:46] <m_gol> oh, that's better :)
[09:30:13] <DaveMethvin> domenic tweeted it, you don't think *I* could figure that out do you?
[09:30:22] <m_gol> :)
[09:30:59] <timmywil> heh, I just figured it out myself

[10:14:18] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: is jQuery still open to point our date i18n efforts into Moment.js? I'm trying to point Wikimedia in that direction as well.
[10:14:19] <Krinkle> https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/315
[10:14:20] <b-ot> Krinkle: Issue #315 by jzaefferer (17mon 3w ago): Explore CLDR for locale database
[10:14:38] <Krinkle> I now have a bit of time available for it in the new few weeks, would be great to collaborate where possible.
[10:14:38] <snover> ugh
[10:14:41] <snover> dojo!
[10:15:03] <snover> dojo locale everything already uses cldr
[10:15:06] <snover> and is availble for you to use, today
[10:19:45] <Krinkle> snover: is it a standalone library, can manipulate through things like add/substract/since, parse various formats, and format including the "time ago" / "from now" style and have available plugins for all the cldr languages?
[10:24:19] <snover> why does it matter if it is ‚Äústandalone‚Äù? you need common utility methods *anyway* unless you like to have 20 implementations of things like mixin/extend/bind/hitch/etc. in your code. the answer to all the other questions is yes, except for a strtotime syntax, but i am sure a patch would be accepted for that and it‚Äôs a lot simpler to do than retrieve and implement a mechanism for using CLDR data
[10:28:47] <Krinkle> sure, but we're not looking to include an entire base library. It would have to be able to create a custom build that requires no additional requests, and can localize by adding 1 or more files to be build based on language (we have our own build / delivery system). Last I checked Dojo wasn't the easiest to integrate in our environment, but we haven't committed to anything yet.
[10:30:47] <snover> well, it‚Äôs all just javascript in amd modules, so if you can use those, then it shouldn‚Äôt be difficult at all
[10:35:57] <Krinkle> also browser support is quite wide for Wikipedia (IE6+, FF4+, Opera10+, Chrome cur-1 ), and we don't use AMD/RequireJS, but if we can flatten that somehow, it'd be good.
[10:36:12] <Krinkle> so basically just ES3 and whatever IE quirks there may be.
[10:41:50] <snover> you could use almond or amdefine or whatever, probably
[10:54:41] <Krinkle> moment.lang('en'); moment('2012-12-31 12:00 -07:00').zone(150).add('days', 7).format('LLLL'); "Monday, January 7 2013 4:30 PM"
[10:54:59] <Krinkle> something like that probably summarises what we'd most commonly use on an average ui
[10:55:07] <Krinkle> dojo localize seems to provide most of this, I'll check it out :)

[14:30:19] <Krinkle> lol, who would've thought the return value of $.inArray would be classified as "Very Hard"
[14:30:20] <Krinkle> http://cl.ly/image/1k1J3O242t2V
[14:30:26] <Krinkle> 75% of people got it wrong.
[14:30:44] <Krinkle> Naming of $.inArray confuses people a lot (e.g. given that PHP's in_array and similar constructs in other languages return boolean)
[14:30:51] <Krinkle> should be indexOf probably...
[14:31:25] <DaveMethvin> we shouldn't have ever exposed it, better to avoid it and tbh i don't think i've ever used it
[15:28:17] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: There's nothing quirky about running binaries installed globally via npm on Windows, is there?

[23:46:14] <lonejack> Is there a way to understand if a div hasn't set height(that is set as default state "auto")?
