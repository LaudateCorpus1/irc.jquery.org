[15:13:55] <chiragSoni> Hello everyone! I am a newbie to the open-source world. I want to contribute to jquery foundation and I have researched for the same. I have knowledge of html, css, javascript and jquery. I am trying to get started but I can't find the list of all projects under jquery. All I found was 4 projects under heading 'Other projects' viz. jquery ui, jquery mobile, Qunit, and Sizzle. Is this all or...
[15:13:56] <chiragSoni> ...there are others so that I can choose one. Also it would be helpful if you can suggest me which project would be better for a beginner.
[15:22:14] <robertmaxrees> chiragSoni did you read http://contribute.jquery.org/open-source/ ?
[15:22:41] <chiragSoni> Yes
[15:23:12] <robertmaxrees> awesome - and you signed the CLA?
[15:23:32] <chiragSoni> robertmaxrees: Yes
[15:24:36] <robertmaxrees> so there are a LOT of different projects - you can look at https://github.com/jquery to get a list of all the repos.
[15:25:42] <robertmaxrees> there are some other bigs ones, like Dojo and Tessel, as well.
[15:27:10] <chiragSoni> robertmaxrees: Can you suggest which one should i go for as beginner?
[15:27:47] <snover> is there really no central page that lists all of them right now?
[15:29:18] <chiragSoni> snover: Not on jquery's websit i think. Although robertmaxrees just  gave the github link for that. Also i didn't find that link anywhere else
[15:31:30] <snover> well there is at least https://github.com/jquery, https://github.com/dojo, https://github.com/theintern, https://github.com/tessel, and https://github.com/lodash
[15:31:44] <snover> and i am definitely forgetting some things
[15:33:20] <chiragSoni> Thanks robertmaxrees and snover for the links
[15:34:01] <robertmaxrees> snover yeah i'm kind of surprised that there's no definitive list.
[15:34:07] <robertmaxrees> especially now with the dojo stuff, too.
[16:18:49] <chiragSoni> robertmaxrees:  I just looked up for jquery core and i found it requires node.js. I googled it and it doesn't look much like front-end development part. Do I need to learn node.js or just installing it once would suffice?
[16:21:35] <chiragSoni> robertmaxrees: I don't have any idea about node.js and its applications. I searched it but couldn't make much sense.
[16:24:15] <gibson042> chiragSoni: node.js is used to run development tasks like linting/style-checking/assembling/minifying files, running tests, etc.
[16:24:33] <gibson042> you don't need to know it inside and out, but you do need it installed
[16:28:14] <chiragSoni> gibson042: So after installing, I won't be supposed to use that?
[16:30:25] <chiragSoni> gibson042: If not, I'm happy. Thanks for the info.
