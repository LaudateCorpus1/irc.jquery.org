[05:05:14] <mikesherov> .
[05:05:15] <bot-t> (10 hours 10 mins ago) <gnarf> tell mikesherov - The answer to testing crazy CORS support might lie in Sinon.js XHR stubs - http://sinonjs.org/
[05:06:56] <mikesherov> gnarf: I wasn't even thinking about mocks
[05:07:29] <mikesherov> bot-t: tell gnarf I wasn't even thinking about mocks. That's a good call in regards to testing CORS
[05:07:29] <bot-t> mikesherov, Okay.
[07:10:07] <rwaldron> ?tell DaveMethvin ping me when you're in
[07:10:08] <bot-t> rwaldron, Okay.
[07:54:07] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin goodmorning
[07:55:08] <rwaldron> I have a patch and tests for http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12199 but it was never assigned to a milestone, so I was waiting to merge into master until you came on
[08:32:32] <DaveMethvin> hey rwaldron
[08:32:33] <bot-t> (1 hour 22 mins ago) <rwaldron> tell DaveMethvin ping me when you're in
[08:33:12] <rwaldron> hey DaveMethvin
[08:33:31] <DaveMethvin> so, on 12199, can it wait until 1.9?
[08:33:58] <DaveMethvin> the only report we got was from jdalton and that's a code review find
[08:41:48] <johnwards> Hey rwaldron, DaveMethvin (and others) are either/both of you considering putting in a paper for jQuery UK?
[08:41:54] <johnwards> https://jqueryuk2013.busyconf.com/proposals/new
[08:42:02] <johnwards> (I'm the organiser btw)
[08:42:05] <rwaldron> johnwards, nope!
[08:42:10] <johnwards> boo :(
[08:42:28] <johnwards> Oxford is lovely you know ;)
[08:42:32] <rwaldron> johnwards sorry :(
[08:43:07] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12076 I just patched this, only to discover that the solution is completely insane and unrealistic.
[08:43:21] <rwaldron> I love when that happens...
[08:43:26] <DaveMethvin> hey johnwards, let me check on my schedule
[08:44:14] <DaveMethvin> johnwards: it's April 19 next year, right?
[08:44:19] <johnwards> yes
[08:46:15] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: well you gave 12076 a try, i think it's safe to close wontfix then. If there's a workaround in your proposed patch you could link to a fiddle
[08:46:28] <DaveMethvin> i have been doing that for wontfix bugs lately
[08:46:36] <DaveMethvin> so people googling can figure out what to do
[08:47:04] <rwaldron> So, basically there is no sane way to detect if a known node has html5 children
[08:47:38] <rwaldron> on a small scale, traversing down through the cchildren and looking for a child.nodeName that matches something in nodeNames (the html5 list) will work nicely
[08:47:53] <rwaldron> but then the 8017 test is a wake up call
[08:48:17] <rwaldron> ...it clones the entire qunit-fixture, so you can imagine how that goes in oldIE
[08:48:50] <DaveMethvin> w h o a
[08:49:19] <rwaldron> The workaround is to not use HTML5 in oldIE
[08:49:26] <rwaldron> I'm actully being serious
[08:49:31] <rwaldron> it just doesnt work
[08:49:39] <rwaldron> we can make it sort of work
[08:50:02] <rwaldron> but then people want to do sloppy things like clone entire tables with <time> elements deeply nested
[08:50:56] <DaveMethvin> well if we can explain the limitations, perhaps in a blog post, I think that's fine
[08:51:09] <DaveMethvin> we need to make it clear we tried hard but it's just not practical
[09:23:03] <johnbender> gnarf: I wasn't clear on what you meant by "vms"
[09:23:16] <johnbender> gnarf: when you responded to my question about reproducing issues
[09:24:25] <johnbender> gnarf: I assume you meant attempting to reproduce using browserstack's traditional web interface to the vm browser combo, which is what I've been doing all along
[09:52:06] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin, rwaldron: I just saw your comments in jquery-meeting about updating docs.
[09:52:17] <kswedberg> it's not that hard. really.
[09:52:28] <DaveMethvin> says the guy who knows how to do it :)
[09:52:40] <kswedberg> haha.
[09:52:42] <DaveMethvin> so what makes it best for you?
[09:52:55] <kswedberg> what do you mean?
[09:53:20] <DaveMethvin> do you want to review the changes?
[09:53:24] <DaveMethvin> should we file pull requests?
[09:53:49] <kswedberg> I don't mind making the changes or merging pull requests, or even just sitting back and watching you make a bunch of changes. ;)
[09:54:05] <DaveMethvin> what i used to do was just edit them in wordpress, and then you came back and fixed them. workedforme :D
[09:54:34] <DaveMethvin> so what is the equivalent today?
[09:54:38] <kswedberg> we can do the same thing, then. except in the repo. you know how github repos work, right? :p
[09:54:55] <DaveMethvin> yeah how DO those things work?
[09:55:14] <kswedberg> I mean, that was one of the main reasons everyone wanted to switch to a github repo. it would make it SO MUCH EASIER.
[09:55:33] <DaveMethvin> well, until i saw what it took to see the finished page in wordpress
[09:55:53] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: the problem for me with needsdocs in trac has always been that it was just a label on a code issue without a real description of what the doc change needed to be.
[09:55:55] <DaveMethvin> clone, install 5 different packages, npm, grunt, sweat, groan
[09:56:14] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: agreed
[09:56:32] <DaveMethvin> it was more of a note to the core team that we needed to write out an explanation
[09:56:33] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: or just clone, fix, push.
[09:56:50] <DaveMethvin> and shouldn't have been a todo for the docs team
[09:56:59] <kswedberg> +1
[09:57:06] <DaveMethvin> that's why i didn't want to just move the needsdocs tix to the docs repo
[09:57:13] <DaveMethvin> there's more work to do there
[09:57:26] <DaveMethvin> we need a description of the issue
[09:58:23] <kswedberg> yes.
[09:58:28] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: if we don't need to see the formatted output in situ, editing on github could work, right?
[09:58:31] <DaveMethvin> no need to clone
[09:59:08] <DaveMethvin> no need even for git on the local system in that case
[09:59:13] <kswedberg> sure, that would work, too. the only danger is when you start adding any kind of html or xml tag. cause if you miss a closing tag, for example, it'll all blow up.
[09:59:13] <DaveMethvin> i think i did one that way a while back
[09:59:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[10:00:42] <kswedberg> remind me in DC, and I'll help get you all set up for realz :)
[10:01:16] <DaveMethvin> oh boy!
[10:41:32] <gnarf> johnbender: the VM that they use for the website is apparently not the same one that they use for API calls
[10:41:33] <bot-t> (5 hours 34 mins ago) <mikesherov> tell gnarf I wasn't even thinking about mocks. That's a good call in regards to testing CORS
[10:41:43] <johnbender> gnarf: zomg
[10:41:48] <johnbender> gnarf: hours of my life wasted
[10:41:59] <gnarf> the API calls use a striped down - no debug addons version supposedly
[10:42:08] <johnbender> *headdesk*
[10:42:26] <johnbender> gnarf: so disable all the addons?
[10:42:40] <gnarf> johnbender: I would suggest tossing them an email if you're having a truely "time wasting" sort of debugging issue with it
[10:42:52] <gnarf> you'll get a response by tomorrow most likely
[10:43:00] <johnbender> gnarf: there isn't any other way I would describe this
[10:43:07] <johnbender> gnarf: what are they going to do?
[10:43:59] <gnarf> johnbender: presumably if you are seeing errors in a VM when we are using it through the API to swarm, but can't ever seem to reproduce said error in the web interface, they might be able to help
[10:44:18] <johnbender> gnarf: have you guys contacted them before about it?
[10:44:25] <gnarf> johnbender: worst case, they are just as clueless as you are about the issue :/
[10:44:41] <johnbender> gnarf: god save them if they try to debug the tests
[10:44:45] <gnarf> johnbender: yes - they are in an assended time zone, but they are great about getting back to us pretty quick
[10:45:37] <gnarf> i just meant we've had problems pretty much across the board with the browserstack VMs from time to time... some ajax issues in chromes lately for instance
[10:45:45] <gnarf> btw DaveMethvin - did we ever figure that one out?
[10:47:12] <DaveMethvin> gnarf johnbender I didn't get a detailed description of the problem in Chrome but they did fix it
[10:48:02] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: orly
[10:48:13] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: what we need is access to the same vms :/
[10:48:18] <gnarf> agree
[10:48:36] <gnarf> perhaps include that thought in the email
[10:48:37] <gnarf> :)
[10:48:48] <johnbender> oh I will
[10:49:02] <gnarf> feel free to CC me gnarf@jquery.com
[10:49:07] <gnarf> or gnarf37@gmail
[10:49:07] <DaveMethvin> i've had times in the past when i couldn't get a clean run in chrome on my own system unless i used an incognito window to avoid plugins changing things
[10:49:11] <gnarf> both go to the same place
[10:49:25] <DaveMethvin> so it's not just a bs thing
[11:01:24] <johnbender> gnarf: email sent
[11:08:54] <gnarf> johnbender: if they don't CC me on the reply - let me know how it pans out plz
[11:15:21] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I'm putting together a new CONTRIBUTING.md to take advantage of github's new feature
[11:15:27] <rwaldron> moving stuff from README
[11:15:40] <rwaldron> Are we enforcing the CLA yet?
[11:16:07] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: yes, new contribs should sign the cla
[11:16:16] <rwaldron> Link?
[11:16:17] <DaveMethvin> i still have some cleanup to do on AUTHORS.txt
[11:16:27] <DaveMethvin> http://jquery.github.com/cla.html
[11:16:33] <rwaldron> awesome
[11:16:37] <rwaldron> this is so exciting
[11:16:47] <rwaldron> I've tweeted this request to github many, many time
[11:16:47] <rwaldron> https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-guidelines
[11:16:50] <DaveMethvin> i didn't want to highly publicize the link since it fills a google docs table
[11:17:02] <DaveMethvin> and we only need people we invite to fill out that form
[11:17:13] <rwaldron> How should we word this?
[11:17:36] <rwaldron> (I'm assuming you dont want me to link to this from the new contributor guide?)
[11:17:39] <DaveMethvin> oh man that's awesome
[11:17:55] <DaveMethvin> yeah let's link it there
[11:18:16] <rwaldron> Rad
[11:18:23] <rwaldron> putting it together now
[11:20:18] <DaveMethvin> "Contributors to jQuery should be willing to sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA) which indicates you're allowing the project to license your code and that you have the right to grant that license.

[11:20:35] <DaveMethvin> or something like that
[11:20:42] <DaveMethvin> we can always edit the file :D
[11:22:37] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin https://gist.github.com/3738894
[11:22:52] <rwaldron> oh, i didnt see that above
[11:22:54] <rwaldron> editting
[11:23:50] <rwaldron> ok updated.. https://gist.github.com/3738894
[11:23:52] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin^
[11:25:48] <DaveMethvin> looks like a good start rwaldron
[11:26:09] <DaveMethvin> we should eventually pull some of those pages into this file
[11:26:18] <DaveMethvin> since docs.jquery.com is going away
[11:26:49] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin working on that now

[18:55:29] <mikesherov> .
[18:55:42] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you there?
[18:55:50] <DaveMethvin> yep mikesherov
[18:56:09] <mikesherov> so, http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12462#comment:9
[18:56:58] <mikesherov> remember that whole getComputedStyle thing during animations borking when a textnode is present
[18:57:14] <mikesherov> it only accidentally worked in 1.7.2
[18:57:20] <mikesherov> and didn't work for all use cases
[18:57:38] <DaveMethvin> so  how did it end up working for that case?
[18:57:43] <mikesherov> so...
[18:58:00] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/754bda21cbc5c9044daf7f968fb9b4ffae39e334/src/effects.js#L186
[18:58:12] <mikesherov> in 1.7.2, this case gets hit for slideDown
[18:58:21] <mikesherov> which is why it's borked in 1.7.2 for slideUp
[18:58:51] <mikesherov> it skips the animation because the text node goes straight to "complete"
[18:59:11] <DaveMethvin> oh haha
[18:59:28] <mikesherov> val === "hide" && hidden
[19:00:08] <mikesherov> so I don't think I can bind animations to nodeType === 1
[19:00:32] <mikesherov> because technically you can animate scrollTop on a window or document, right?
[19:00:40] <DaveMethvin> yes
[19:00:46] <DaveMethvin> and on plain objects etc
[19:00:51] <DaveMethvin> hmm
[19:00:54] <mikesherov> right, so...
[19:01:21] <mikesherov> I'm not sure what exactly to do here except swallow exceptions
[19:01:29] <DaveMethvin> noooo!
[19:01:40] <mikesherov> right
[19:01:42] <DaveMethvin> dammit we should have eaten text nodes out of $()
[19:01:50] <DaveMethvin> it's too late for that
[19:01:58] <mikesherov> get a time machine
[19:02:02] <mikesherov> and warn John
[19:02:15] <DaveMethvin> and kill hitler
[19:02:31] <mikesherov> well, always kill hitler
[19:02:35] <mikesherov> but that was a given
[19:03:14] <DaveMethvin> i dunno
[19:03:31] <mikesherov> I mean, it's like calling slideUp on a document and expecting it to work
[19:03:54] <DaveMethvin> right, it's just that $("text nodez n shit").animate() is more likely
[19:04:04] <DaveMethvin> at least if you use a templating systme
[19:04:25] <DaveMethvin> and people expect us to throw them out
[19:04:35] <mikesherov> right, and shit
[19:04:44] <mikesherov> so swallow exceptions?
[19:04:44] <DaveMethvin> is there any reasonable thing you could do to animate a text node?
[19:04:55] <mikesherov> um, what are it's properties?
[19:05:11] <DaveMethvin> nodeValue
[19:05:13] <DaveMethvin> ?
[19:05:40] <DaveMethvin> i really dislike swallowing exceptions
[19:05:48] <DaveMethvin> it just hides so much possible mayhem
[19:06:42] <DaveMethvin> but text nodes are just the most common
[19:06:47] <DaveMethvin> comment nodes?
[19:06:54] <mikesherov> right
[19:07:13] <mikesherov> so only text nodes and comment nodes and elements come out of $.parseHTML()
[19:07:31] <mikesherov> I suppose you could animate .textContent of a textnode
[19:07:43] <DaveMethvin> if we're going to accept plain objects and just about anything to animate, it seems like we should be asking for people to send us just the stuff they want to animate
[19:07:56] <DaveMethvin> and use .filter("*") in front of animate
[19:08:00] <DaveMethvin> if that's what they want to do
[19:08:24] <DaveMethvin> let me create a pathological case
[19:09:16] <mikesherov> http://jsfiddle.net/RBSF7/4/
[19:09:22] <mikesherov> animating textContent!
[19:10:34] <DaveMethvin> haha!
[19:11:26] <mikesherov> so, yeah
[19:11:29] <mikesherov> that's fun
[19:13:23] <mikesherov> Especially because it only circumstantially worked in 1.7.2, I'm inclined to tell this guy wontfix
[19:14:12] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it's quite fixable with a filter
[19:14:30] <DaveMethvin> other than just wrapping it in a try/catch i don't see a clean way to prevent this
[19:14:41] <DaveMethvin> without lots of special checks
[19:15:21] <mikesherov> 100%
[19:15:31] <mikesherov> You're responsible for what you're animating
[19:16:06] <DaveMethvin> okay, let's go with that
[19:16:28] <mikesherov> I suppose I can make sure it's an element for the cases where it's doing special stuff for defaultPrefilter and uses .style
[19:16:58] <mikesherov> or does claiming to support that open us up
[19:17:20] <DaveMethvin> well i guess there's already an isElement for those cases
[19:17:49] <mikesherov> in 1.7.2, sure
[19:18:04] <DaveMethvin> oh right
[19:18:38] <DaveMethvin> ugh, why does software have to be so hard?
[19:18:47] <mikesherov> but that doesn't really stop it for slideUp
[19:18:57] <mikesherov> it only coincidentally worked for slideDown
[19:19:20] <mikesherov> I can figure out where that case goes wrong and see if there is anything I can do
[19:19:24] <DaveMethvin> yeah let's not start adding a bunch of checks, at least not yet
[19:19:39] <mikesherov> if there isn't anything super small and reasonable, I'm going to wontfix
[19:22:08] <mikesherov> so I can unbreak it back to the point it was at on 1.7.2
[19:22:26] <mikesherov> for 3 bytes
[19:22:50] <DaveMethvin> how useful might that be i wonder
[19:23:02] <DaveMethvin> like, the reason we're seeing this is just that it happened to work before
[19:23:21] <DaveMethvin> so the person doing something close but not quite the same it never worked
[19:23:35] <DaveMethvin> and they must have found a solution without a bug
[19:23:51] <DaveMethvin> s/bug/filing a bug/
[19:24:06] <mikesherov> right
[19:37:14] <snover> DaveMethvin: yooooooo!
[19:37:33] <DaveMethvin> snover: meeeeeee?
[19:38:30] <snover> the replies on the licensing blog are hilarious
[19:39:14] <DaveMethvin> oh i haven't checked lately
[19:39:31] <snover> “September 10th, 2012 The day jQuery died.”
[19:39:54] <snover> then there is some spam post
[19:40:18] <DaveMethvin> hmm, o
[19:40:23] <DaveMethvin> i will delete that one
[19:40:27] <DaveMethvin> it used to email me about posts
[19:40:42] <DaveMethvin> you are not the Modulator
[19:41:06] <snover> I just imagine it in the voice of a dalek
[19:41:57] <mikesherov> MODULATE ALL FREQUENCIES
[19:42:34] <DaveMethvin> oh that guy spammed a BUNCH of posts
[19:44:13] <snover> the HN title is awesome too
[19:44:16] <snover> BIG CORPORATION HAND?
[19:44:32] <snover> Imagine a million hands pushing down the faces of developers, forever
[19:45:37] <DaveMethvin> it must be a conspiracy
[19:46:13] <snover> bums me how how few people understand these things
[19:46:17] <snover> out how*
[19:47:04] <DaveMethvin> well that's because the only people who generally care are lawyers
[19:47:16] <DaveMethvin> and they only care when their client wants to sue for some advantage
[19:47:29] <snover> or david mark
[19:47:35] <DaveMethvin> ah, true
[19:48:04] <DaveMethvin> like, we should all let anonymous people drop code in our laps, because it's free as in herpes
[19:48:22] <snover> i guess he tried to pull similar shenanigans against dojo and/or my employer at some point
[19:49:35] <snover> i approve of your analogy
[19:50:00] <DaveMethvin> well what really sealed the david mark affair for me was when he came up with some cases that broke jQuery, then told john he couldn't use them
[19:50:21] <DaveMethvin> that pegged the douchebag meter for me
[19:51:17] <snover> how does someone manage to have such a black soul
[19:51:59] <snover> perhaps more importantly
[19:52:00] <snover> http://pledgie.com/campaigns/9768
[19:52:01] <snover> how
[19:52:02] <snover> who
[19:52:36] <snover> why
[19:52:36] <DaveMethvin> wat
[19:52:36] <b-ot> Looking at the current offerings it's not very to do better. Ugh.
[19:52:49] <DaveMethvin> haha, he donated to his own fund
[19:52:54] <DaveMethvin> "Mark family"
[19:53:10] <DaveMethvin> "MOM! I need some money!"
[19:53:26] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: figured out a great solution for http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12462
[19:53:44] <DaveMethvin> oh good, what is it mikesherov
[19:54:00] <mikesherov> the default propHook is fault
[19:54:03] <mikesherov> faulty*
[19:54:14] <mikesherov> so, I restored the isElement check in defaultPrefilter
[19:54:21] <mikesherov> and changed how the propHook worked
[19:54:39] <mikesherov> before, it only returned the prop (instead of the css prop) if the prop was defined
[19:55:02] <mikesherov> I just changed it to return the prop when the prop is defined OR style doesn't exist
[19:55:43] <DaveMethvin> ah, elegant!
[19:55:49] <mikesherov> from this: if ( tween.elem[ tween.prop ] != null && ( !tween.elem.style || tween.elem.style[ tween.prop ] == null ) ) {
[19:56:00] <mikesherov> to this: if ( !tween.elem.style || ( tween.elem[ tween.prop ] != null && tween.elem.style[ tween.prop ] == null ) ) {
[19:56:09] <DaveMethvin> how very compressive of you mikesherov
[19:56:28] <mikesherov> that stops textNodes from borking
[19:56:37] <mikesherov> and is at least as good as the check was before
[19:56:56] <DaveMethvin> but can I animate comment nodes?
[19:57:00] <DaveMethvin> if not you suck
[19:57:03] <mikesherov> yes, if you'd like
[19:57:15] <DaveMethvin> well my whole web site depends on it
[19:57:17] <DaveMethvin> somehow
[19:57:20] <mikesherov> LOL
[19:59:26] <mikesherov> so, should I submit for 1.8.2?
[20:00:16] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[20:00:35] <DaveMethvin> ga and make a pull, it SEEMS like it might be a good idea
[20:00:43] <mikesherov> k
[20:00:54] <DaveMethvin> but my decision making process goes downhill after 11pm
[20:01:12] <DaveMethvin> thanks mikesherov
[20:01:28] <mikesherov> LOL, no
[20:01:31] <mikesherov> np*
[22:17:04] <gnarf> Krinkle|detached:
[22:17:05] <gnarf> nooooo
[22:18:17] <gnarf> jzaefferer: ping
[22:30:44] <gnarf> Krinkle - Can we upgrade mediawiki on docs.jquery.com's new host?  check jqadmin@eol3.jquery.com:/var/www/docs.jquery.com/public_html -- I had to manually sed 's/Namespace::/MWNamespace::' and change the class name in includes... it felt dirty ;)
[22:34:55] <gnarf> danheberden: ;)
[22:35:02] <danheberden> gnarf is the new ip the email you jsut sent?
[22:35:04] <danheberden> *just
[22:35:11] <gnarf> no
[22:35:16] <danheberden> what's the new ip?
[22:35:24] <gnarf> 216.70.110.53
[22:35:37] <danheberden> oh, wait, it's not running there though
[22:35:39] <danheberden> cuz of the php problem
[22:36:23] <danheberden> i'm logged in but i don't think i'm an admin
[22:36:43] <danheberden> gnarf do you just want to log in as me?
[22:36:45] <gnarf> I actually think i found a workaround
[22:36:50] <gnarf> for the php problem
[22:36:51] <danheberden> i think i added myself manually
[22:36:53] <danheberden> before
[22:36:56] <danheberden> oh?
[22:36:57] <danheberden> nice
[22:37:04] <gnarf> like i moved the DNS over
[22:37:10] <gnarf> bout to send a follow up
[22:37:19] <gnarf> there was a class named "Namespace"
[22:37:22] <gnarf> read up
[22:37:27] <gnarf> i cc'ed Krinkle
[22:37:46] <danheberden> oh, haha
[22:37:48] <gnarf> namespace is a reserved word in new php
[22:37:50] <danheberden> future proof!
[22:38:04] <danheberden> that's kind of funny
[22:38:24] <danheberden> that's like a pre-processor for js using 'use strict';
[22:38:33] <gnarf> :)
[22:38:41] <danheberden> so do you want my creds?
[22:38:52] <gnarf> nah
[22:38:55] <gnarf> if you can log in
[22:39:02] <gnarf> i think i can sunset the old machine in a few hours
[22:39:12] <danheberden> lemme try the new ip
[22:39:16] <danheberden> now that i verified i have an account
[22:39:33] <gnarf> kill all the procs, one final backup and shutdown
[22:40:41] <danheberden> gnarf, logged in
[22:40:54] <danheberden> and verified it's the right site - changed my pw on the old one
[22:41:01] <danheberden> got wrong pw on the new one, used the old pw, got in
[22:41:35] <danheberden> was able to save user prefs
[22:41:37] <danheberden> on the new one
[22:45:05] <gnarf> danheberden: coo
[22:45:06] <gnarf> thanks
[22:46:29] <danheberden> gnarf :D
