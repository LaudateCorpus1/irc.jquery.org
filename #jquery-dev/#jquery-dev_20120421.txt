[06:44:01] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from wbotelhos: How slow is jQuery? http://t.co/iyrZ0vK3 ★ http://bit.ly/HVhK48
[06:44:19] <mikesherov> ajpiano: how slow is it?
[06:44:27] <ajpiano> dot jay peg
[06:45:15] <mikesherov> TESTED IN CHROME 16
[06:45:21] <mikesherov> best of all browsers
[06:45:35] <mikesherov> jQuery maximizes developer happiness, not speed
[06:45:55] <mikesherov> if you want speed, do it natively
[09:22:05] <timmywil> hi danheberden
[09:22:09] <timmywil> i mean DaveMethvin
[09:22:12] <timmywil> sry dan
[15:09:36] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: with no functional changes yet, improved performance and -188 compressed :D
[15:09:49] <DaveMethvin> YEAAAAAHH!
[15:09:52] <DaveMethvin> go timmywil
[15:10:12] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: so far https://github.com/timmywil/sizzle/compare/master...revamp
[15:13:22] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: the only things left are adding the QSA assertions (which should result in getting to use QSA more often), checking what character encoding we should be supporting, adding any unsupported css3 selectors if they're easy and don't take up room, and flush out your cache selection idea
[15:14:16] <timmywil> but I'll get to that stuff tomorrow :)
[15:14:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah one day at at time :D
[15:14:39] <timmywil> I'm really excited about what's here so far
[15:15:01] <DaveMethvin> i see you're doing a feature detect for the id/name confusion in IE, of course we duplicate that each time in .init()
[15:15:19] <timmywil> yup, that's another step, seeing what I can remove in init
[15:15:19] <DaveMethvin> i am tempted to see how much of a  hit we get from delegating back to sizzle
[15:15:58] <DaveMethvin> i just removed $("body") since it was there to game a benchmark :)
[15:16:33] <timmywil> most engines seem to optimize for body
[15:16:39] <timmywil> I just left that in sizzle
[15:17:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah they optimize for it because of the benchmark
[15:17:23] <timmywil> heh
[15:17:25] <timmywil> well
[15:17:46] <timmywil> might as well
[15:17:53] <DaveMethvin> i wonder how much of a benefit it would be to have special cases for  "tag", ".class", "#id"
[15:18:11] <gnarf> timmywil: woot
[15:18:13] <timmywil> you mean in init?
[15:18:17] <gnarf> timmywil: thanks for coverin me :)
[15:18:24] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[15:18:31] <DaveMethvin> the "body" optimization just bugs me
[15:18:40] <timmywil> oh, well we do ID, but so does sizzle
[15:18:46] <DaveMethvin> at least "tag" is general
[15:18:58] <DaveMethvin> and should work for XML too
[15:19:04] <DaveMethvin> XML ...
[15:19:07] * DaveMethvin shakes fist
[15:19:16] <gnarf> check out this work in progress: http://citadel.jquery.com/zabbix/overview.php
[15:19:42] <timmywil> ehh, xml is a maybe for tags
[15:19:52] <DaveMethvin> wow that's some status page gnarf
[15:20:23] <timmywil> gnarf: :)
[15:20:29] <timmywil> alright, gotta run
[15:20:31] <timmywil> bbl
[15:20:35] <DaveMethvin> thanks timmywil
[15:21:03] <DaveMethvin> well gnarf if timmy can hold down the size it looks like we net out pretty well
[15:21:25] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: the compression junkies have gotten effects <150 i think
[15:23:29] <DaveMethvin> bbl
[15:29:08] <gnarf> danheberden: are you around?
