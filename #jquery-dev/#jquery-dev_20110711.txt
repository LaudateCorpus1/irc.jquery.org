[06:10:26] <timmywil_> ciao
[06:11:08] <kswedberg> hello timmywil / timmywil_
[06:11:25] <timmywil_> kswedberg: hi!
[06:11:51] <timmywil_> looks like I'll be timmywil_ for the day.  Left my home computer on I guess.
[06:11:57] <kswedberg> :)
[06:15:15] <miketaylr> timmywil_: you can ghost your other nick :)
[06:15:33] <timmywil_> miketaylr: how?
[06:15:48] <miketaylr>  /msg nickserv ghost timmywil password
[06:15:58] <miketaylr> that'll boot him
[06:17:06] <timmywil> miketaylr: cool, thx for the tip
[06:17:21] <miketaylr> np
[06:22:20] <JohnResig> ajpiano: k, I'll try to be there by 11:30!
[06:31:35] <jaubourg> hi guys
[06:31:41] <JohnResig> jaubourg: heya
[06:31:46] <JohnResig> jaubourg: you going to be around today?
[06:31:51] <jaubourg> yes
[06:31:51] <JohnResig> timmywil: you as well?
[06:31:54] <JohnResig> awesome :)
[06:32:04] <timmywil> JohnResig: yup
[06:32:14] <jaubourg> though I have an rpg game at 7:30pm my time
[06:32:15] <JohnResig> sweet, sounds like we'll get started in about 2 hours or so
[06:32:23] <timmywil> it's a party!
[06:32:32] <jaubourg> \o/
[06:36:17] <jaubourg> dunno if you guys saw but I pushed this: https://github.com/jaubourg/usejs allows to define modules like this: https://raw.github.com/jaubourg/usejs/master/test/data/simple.module.js and this: https://raw.github.com/jaubourg/usejs/master/test/data/complex.module.js sandboxed using iframe, relative pathing for require and a mean to transform any script into a module ;)
[06:36:27] <jaubourg> still need to write docs of course :/
[06:37:39] <jaubourg> anyway, just wanting to share
[06:40:29] <timmywil> jaubourg: nice
[06:41:02] <jaubourg> :)
[06:41:26] <jaubourg> code is horrid but I didn't get time to organize it better... < 4kB minified so heh
[06:42:25] <timmywil> jaubourg: i like that you used padolsey's ie detection :)
[06:42:39] <jaubourg> well, will fail in IE10 sadly
[06:42:48] <timmywil> yea
[06:42:52] <jaubourg> hopefully the workarounds won't be needed in there
[06:43:03] <jaubourg> but I don't hold my breath
[06:43:17] <timmywil> I wouldn't either
[06:52:06] <jaubourg> 229 unit tests for this node lib... pheeew
[06:54:55] <DaveMethvin> so JohnResig are you coming to bocoup?
[06:55:00] <JohnResig> DaveMethvin: yes
[06:55:02] <JohnResig> 11:30am
[06:55:15] <DaveMethvin> cool, cya then i just got in

[06:56:23] <bot-t> jaubourg, Boston, MA - Time: 9:56 Monday (EDT), Weather: Partly Cloudy, 26∞C / 79∞F
[06:56:39] <DaveMethvin> what, they haven't named a city after him YET?

[06:58:05] <DaveMethvin> it's like dynamic dns
[06:58:12] <aaronmcadam> hah
[06:59:40] <jaubourg> the JohnResig Effect(tm)
[07:00:08] <jaubourg> I can picture city workers sweating to get all the signs updated before John lands at the airport
[07:00:40] <JohnResig> hahaha
[07:01:01] <jaubourg> and tourism centers revising their tour guides: $( "mall" ).has( "appleStore" )
[07:01:36] <jaubourg> and that make you laugh! Sadist!
[07:01:42] <jaubourg> :P
[08:07:28] <JohnResig> DaveMethvin, ajpiano: I forgot my wallet and missed the bus as a result - I'll be in by noon - sorry about that!
[08:07:37] <DaveMethvin> kk
[08:10:55] <timmywil> wallet fail
[08:11:37] <JohnResig> this is the second time this has happened, it's the worst - about to get on the bus, then realize you don't have your wallet
[08:11:45] <JohnResig> the sad march back home
[08:12:20] <gnarf> JohnResig: :/
[08:12:30] <gnarf> JohnResig: i woke up without power... :)
[08:15:10] <jaubourg> happens to me all the time John :/
[08:15:31] <jaubourg> supergnarf?
[08:16:25] <gnarf> jaubourg: walked to work where he has a generator, now heading to a friends house who has power, but his work doesn't ;)
[08:28:14] <ajpiano> jaubourg, gnarf, you gents joining us today?
[08:32:00] <tbranyen> DaveMethvin: You're in our training room!
[08:32:12] <DaveMethvin> yep!
[08:32:22] <tbranyen> I'll come say hi later
[08:32:24] <DaveMethvin> steelin yer internets
[08:33:09] <timmywil> new skype name: timmywillison
[08:37:38] <gnarf> ajpiano: got a lot of work work --- power out all over the city messes with ISPs ;)
[08:37:50] <gnarf> more tommorow right?
[08:38:21] <ajpiano> yessir
[08:38:34] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano just blew out out ears
[08:38:42] <jaubourg> I'M IN UR BOWCU, STEALIN' UR BENDWIZ
[08:38:43] <AzaToth> I have something to say:
[08:38:45] <ajpiano> x2
[08:38:48] <AzaToth> I HATE IE
[08:38:51] <ajpiano> lol
[08:39:02] <DaveMethvin> AzaToth: the line starts over there ====>
[08:39:05] <jaubourg> AzaToth: how predictable ;)
[08:39:10] <AzaToth> „ÉÑ
[08:39:57] <AzaToth> I troubleshooted an wizard I've made which didn't post all fields in IE, just because some had never been "changed"
[08:40:58] <AzaToth> why can't it get the logic that the currently visible value in an select is 'SELECTED'
[08:40:59] <AzaToth> ffs
[08:41:18] <kreantos> hey
[08:41:20] <kreantos> i have a datepicker problem
[08:41:22] <kreantos> how do i can get the actual month of the calender in the beforeshowday callback
[08:42:02] <AzaToth> kreantos: this channel is mainly an developer channel, normal questions usally go into #jquery
[08:42:17] <kreantos> ah ok sry
[08:42:21] <AzaToth> np
[08:42:28] <ajpiano> kreantos: what AzaToth just said - but fwiw, you can try calling fooo.datepicker("getDate") in the beforeShowDay callback
[08:42:47] <kreantos> someone in #jquery told me to ask here
[08:42:53] <AzaToth> lol
[08:42:57] <kreantos> ajpiano: this is not what i want
[08:43:05] <AzaToth> bureaucrazy
[08:43:11] <ajpiano> well let's not talk about this here please
[08:43:30] <kreantos> but i think the root of my problem belongs here
[08:43:36] <kreantos> may i tell you?
[08:43:37] <ajpiano> kreantos: he also told you to go to jqueryui-dev, not jquery-ev
[08:43:48] * AzaToth always wondered why there exists in datepicker in ui, seems always rather specific
[08:44:10] <ajpiano> miketaylr: you here?
[08:44:30] <kreantos> ah ok, sry bothering you and thx
[08:45:08] <AzaToth> ajpiano: is the traffic so high it warrants separate dev channels for ui and core?
[08:45:32] <ajpiano> it was a decision we made a few months ago
[08:45:34] <AzaToth> or is it just that the peops can't stand sitting with eachother? „ÉÑ
[08:45:40] <ajpiano> and yes it is worth it
[08:45:46] <ajpiano> because otherwise it's really confusing
[08:45:51] <AzaToth> true
[08:45:58] <ajpiano> jqueryui dev chat used to be on skype
[08:46:00] <ajpiano> etc etc
[08:46:04] <AzaToth> ah
[08:51:50] <timmywil> however, this channel is often too quiet
[08:52:49] <ajpiano> idle hands, etc.
[09:01:18] <AzaToth> well, jzaefferer joined, so perhaps there will be more shouting now „ÉÑ
[09:02:44] <AzaToth> ajpiano: dunno if anyone replied last week, but do you know if teh codemine hangs around here?
[09:03:33] <AzaToth> Frippe: use server password instead of nickserv password
[09:05:08] <AzaToth> the blody hidden feature of IRC, use server password, and you won't have the "Changing host" cycle
[09:07:02] <Frippe> okay thanks AzaToth
[09:07:26] <jaubourg> https://github.com/creative-area/node-plus
[09:11:06] <AzaToth> jaubourg: hope that doesn't go cpan
[09:11:24] <jaubourg> cpan?
[09:11:45] <AzaToth> first there was cpan, then arrived cpanm, after that cpanm
[09:11:48] <DaveMethvin> #jquery-meeting if you are interested ... starting a bit late b/c of network issues here at bocoup
[09:12:20] <jaubourg> AzaToth: I don't get the reference, I'm sorry :/
[09:12:32] <AzaToth> jaubourg: adding "plus" to something
[09:13:26] <jaubourg> oh
[09:13:59] <jaubourg> yeah, well, it's all about adding into the global and give new environment of sort so heh, thought "plus" covered it :/
[09:20:54] <jaubourg> ping (need to go in 40 minutes though :/)
[09:21:20] <peol> btw guys, socialhapy now detects github commits
[09:21:21] <peol> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/1886d7443453feab0b73f4a7c4b15fbd9401c4af
[09:21:23] <socialhapy> http://bit.ly/pXR9ro timmywil (2 days ago) on jquery: Check the attribute node value for false for HTML5 booleans when not supported. Fixes #9504.
[09:21:43] <DaveMethvin> sweet!
[09:22:32] <jaubourg> ajpiano?
[09:22:38] <ajpiano> hey jaubourg
[09:22:56] <jaubourg> dunno if it's that crucial I join for 30 minutes?
[09:23:23] <jaubourg> I'm ready and on skype if it is though
[09:26:14] <ajpiano> jaubourg: we can wait 30 for you if you have something to do, we'll buzz you in
[09:26:19] <ajpiano> or ping us when you're ready
[09:26:27] <jaubourg> no, I'll be gone in 30 minutes :/
[09:27:24] <jaubourg> that's the problem with evening my time... I generally have something scheduled already (rpg sessions are scheduled something like 2 months in advance)
[09:32:07] <AzaToth> don't tell me you are an WoW nerd
[09:32:08] <jzaefferer> yeah, Julian has swing a sword now and slay some dragons!
[09:32:20] <jzaefferer> I don't think he's talking about WoW
[09:32:27] <jzaefferer> that isn't really a rpg
[09:32:29] <ben_alman> and i wasn't even talking
[09:32:34] <ben_alman> so it couldn't have been me
[09:32:56] <AzaToth> ben_alman: but you are?
[09:33:27] <AzaToth> jaubourg: RPG as an swords and dragons, or RPG as in 7
[09:33:31] <AzaToth> ?
[09:33:55] <ben_alman> yeah, i play wow
[09:34:26] <AzaToth> for most people, RPG is —Ä—É—á–Ω–æ–π –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤–æ—Ç–∞–Ω–∫–æ–≤—ã–π –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∞—Ç–æ–º—ë—Ç
[09:34:26] <jaubourg> AzaToth: pen & paper rpg: D&D, Shadowrun, Cthulhu, etc
[09:34:41] <AzaToth> jaubourg: ah
[09:34:48] <AzaToth> you'r an oldschooler
[09:34:52] <jaubourg> yep
[09:34:55] <AzaToth> nice
[09:34:57] <jzaefferer> jaubourg: are you actually playing all of them?
[09:35:01] <jaubourg> and I'm Game Master tonight, so I cannot skip it
[09:35:12] <jaubourg> jorn: no I was just giving examples ;)
[09:35:31] <jaubourg> I play custom-made or obscure french RPGs you guys probably never heard of ;)
[09:35:41] <AzaToth> lol
[09:35:48] <ben_alman> munchkin is a fun rpg card game
[09:35:51] <ben_alman> really silly
[09:36:00] <ben_alman> not at all serious
[09:36:04] <gnarf> ben_alman: its awesome
[09:36:09] <AzaToth> jaubourg: I assume the most used weapon are silk napkins and perfume
[09:36:18] <jaubourg> yeah, the rpg club is a house where the lower floor is taken by a card/table-top game club
[09:36:19] * AzaToth hides
[09:36:34] <jaubourg> I'm sure John would be ecstatic to go there and play some insane german game
[09:36:59] * jaubourg spanks AzaToth :P
[09:37:17] <AzaToth> jaubourg: german RPG excludes the R and the G part
[09:37:32] <AzaToth> at least the G part
[09:38:14] <jzaefferer> wut?
[09:38:24] <AzaToth> and the russians... they'll showel up an RPG in yer arse if you ask for a game
[09:38:30] <jaubourg> don't badmouth germans out here AzaToth :P
[09:38:35] <AzaToth> jaubourg: heh
[09:39:00] <AzaToth> I'
[09:39:08] <AzaToth> I'm not as badmouthed as http://satwcomic.com/
[09:39:10] <jaubourg> I was talking about german board games... the kind with insane maths and organization involved
[09:39:29] <AzaToth> jaubourg: ah
[09:39:29] <jaubourg> german publishers are reknown for them
[09:39:44] <jzaefferer> what are those actually?
[09:39:55] <jzaefferer> Settlers of Catan is a german game, and its pretty easy to learn
[09:40:08] <jzaefferer> the most complex board games I play aren't german ones, like Descent
[09:40:55] <jaubourg> oh, don't misunderstand me... it's more of a general trend and there are exceptions... but american games are usually more about random dice rolls, german ones about managing resources, french games about being silly
[09:40:59] <ben_alman> AzaToth, you play wow?
[09:41:04] <jaubourg> there are cross-overs of course
[09:41:12] <jzaefferer> basically most of the games of Fantasy Flight Games are pretty complex: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/index.asp
[09:41:20] <AzaToth> ben_alman: no
[09:41:50] <ben_alman> ok
[09:41:59] <ben_alman> good for you :P
[09:42:08] <jaubourg> yeah, I know there's also a trend in the current french board-game "scene" to have more complex and "management"-based games
[09:42:31] <jaubourg> dunno the name of this game I play-tested that was like this last time I was at a conf
[09:43:21] <jaubourg> ben_alman: I used to be a nolife... then I got my life back ;)
[09:44:26] <AzaToth> http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4815/the-campaign-for-north-africa seems like something you wouldn't want to play
[09:44:46] <ben_alman> oof
[09:45:12] <jaubourg> anyway, jzaefferer: don't take this as some kind of racial profiling or whatnot, it was really just a general observation that may be pretty innacurate as of today... keep in mind I've been playing RPGs for nearly 25 years now ;)
[09:45:28] <AzaToth> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Campaign_for_North_Africa
[09:45:32] <jzaefferer> hehe
[09:45:34] <jzaefferer> that's okay
[09:45:44] <AzaToth> jaubourg: above you might be able to play for 25 years more „ÉÑ
[09:46:01] <jzaefferer> have you heard of Das Schwarze Auge? "The Black Eye"? Dunno if there's a french translation...
[09:46:08] <jzaefferer> I've been playing that for a long time
[09:46:10] <jaubourg> jorn: nope
[09:46:24] <jaubourg> but I'm really more about RPG than board games
[09:46:39] <jaubourg> though, of course, I played a lot since RPGer tend to like board games too
[09:46:51] <jaubourg> I dunno, I like the RP part of RPGs too much
[09:46:53] <ben_alman> Neuroshima Hex is a rather expensive board game, but the iOS app is great and only like $5
[09:47:36] <ben_alman> http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/21241/neuroshima-hex
[09:48:18] <jzaefferer> we recently started with Shadowrun 4 - so much different then medieval/fantasy settings...
[09:49:07] <jaubourg> loved Shadowrun when I played but I'm afraid I'm 2 versions behind... setting is excellent if the GM plays it "professional" and skips the most insane parts of the background
[09:49:42] <jzaefferer> yeah, you have to be somewhat selective, just too much craziness stuffed into one world
[09:49:46] <jaubourg> the mix of corporate innuendo + urban mercenaries + magic + indians == win
[09:50:07] <ajpiano> timmywil: POINT
[09:50:11] <ajpiano> POING*
[09:50:12] <jaubourg> but yeah, they got over their head with some stuff
[09:50:23] <AzaToth> ·πïoing?
[09:50:37] <AzaToth> combined ping and pong?
[09:50:39] <jaubourg> damnit, 10 mins left and I gotta fly
[09:50:50] <jaubourg> that's not the only day we do this, right?
[09:50:58] <AzaToth> it is
[09:51:02] <jaubourg> :(
[09:52:22] <addyosmani> triage sprint on today?
[09:52:38] <ben_alman> yeah
[09:52:48] <addyosmani> awesome
[09:52:51] <jaubourg> yep and unable to attend... oh well, I guess I'll have a good list of assigned bugs when I get back tonight
[09:53:31] <addyosmani> we'll just tag all the ajax ones with your name jaubourg ; )
[09:53:48] <ajpiano> addyosmani: yeah, we're not on skype yet
[09:54:15] <addyosmani> thats cool ajpiano
[09:54:40] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: since they're enumerated, should we use true or "true" ?
[09:55:03] <jaubourg> addy: don't hesitate, I have a billion projects going on right now so I need the dingage in my mail box to focus my attention
[09:55:48] <addyosmani> sounds like a plan, jaubourg. I'm sure they won't be *too* many.
[09:56:29] <jaubourg> seems like the number of ajax bug reports got back to being reasonable... that's that I guess ;)
[09:59:08] <jaubourg> ok, gotta fly
[09:59:14] <jaubourg> cya all later guys
[09:59:48] <addyosmani> later jaubourg
[10:13:30] <timmywil> im back
[10:13:46] <timmywil> ajpiano
[10:14:07] <timmywil> had a lunch meeting
[10:14:24] <ajpiaNOU> timmywil: hooary
[10:15:55] <ajpiano> timmywil: can you go on skype
[10:16:10] <timmywil> ajpiano: im on, new name: timmywillison
[10:16:55] <ajpiano> aahh
[10:19:53] <JohnResig> New Report: http://bugs.jquery.com/report/207
[10:20:00] <JohnResig> New Wiki Page: http://docs.jquery.com/Won%27t_Fix
[10:21:11] <addyosmani> So, are we going to document anything we tag as wontfix or just very specific cases?
[10:21:33] <addyosmani> on the wiki page I mean
[10:22:10] <ajpiano> addyosmani: just recurring/contentious big issues
[10:22:28] <addyosmani> sounds reasonable
[10:23:11] <timmywil> small jump in IE6, not sure why
[10:23:38] <timmywil> side-effect of filter application?
[10:25:37] <ajpiano> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5437398/problem-with-image-and-transparent-filter-for-ie
[10:26:29] <timmywil> hmm, maybe we can? http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/jzHFb/
[10:32:05] <timmywil> leave 1123 open, I'd like to take a closer look at that one
[10:33:36] <addyosmani> Looks like I'm going to have to join jaubourg in missing this sprint. Train to catch : (
[10:33:58] <addyosmani> If someone could review the pull request on 9681 that would be rad.
[10:37:19] <timmywil> addyosmani: will do
[10:37:49] <addyosmani> cheers!
[10:38:09] <addyosmani> will take a look at some more tickets this evening. g'luck with the sprint, all!
[10:38:27] <JohnResig> addthanks!
[10:43:44] <timmywil> :not(:want(:fix(this))))
[11:12:34] <timmywil> skype is messin
[11:15:59] <timmywil> JohnResig: you're closing 4171?  I agree.
[12:10:35] <timmywil> I think docs#4521 was fixed in the support changes
[12:10:36] <bot-t> [#4521] A strange phenomenon about showing in IE (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/4521
[12:20:57] <timmywil> http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/ZHNKf/7/
[13:15:21] <scott_gonzalez_> timmywil: you around?
[13:15:32] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez_: hey yea
[13:15:39] <timmywil> doin the bug triage thing
[13:15:42] <scott_gonzalez_> is your fiddle, you were using a boolean
[13:15:56] <scott_gonzalez_> do you know if it matters if you use a boolean or a string?
[13:15:57] <timmywil> which was that?
[13:16:05] <timmywil> oh that
[13:16:09] <scott_gonzalez_> http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/aRgvB/
[13:16:17] <scott_gonzalez_> seems like it should be a string since it's enumerated
[13:16:28] <timmywil> attr sets everything to string
[13:16:34] <timmywil> so doesn't matter what is passed
[13:16:42] <scott_gonzalez_> ok
[13:16:49] <scott_gonzalez_> but we should expect "true" to come back, not true
[13:16:52] <scott_gonzalez_> correct?
[13:16:54] <timmywil> right
