[06:00:12] <gibson042> .
[06:48:09] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I've never seen a GitHub error like this before: http://cl.ly/image/1T432N3Q2e3x
[07:15:32] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: There was one more thing I wanted to discuss prior to the release.
[07:15:47] <scott_gonzalez> What do you think about changing package.json licenses filed to point to the actual license file? https://github.com/scottgonzalez/test-jquery-ui/blob/master/package.json#L46
[07:16:20] <scott_gonzalez> Then during the release, we update it to point at the tag: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/test-jquery-ui/commit/0cbfacc56507f48edf9ec86efe1fc9d5870ed084#L0L46
[07:16:22] <socialhapy> ★ Github API: no commit found
[07:17:29] <scott_gonzalez> That way the package.json for each version links to the correct files, with our actual copyright and year in it.
[07:18:58] <timmywil> is it just me or is jsbin looking really attractive these days
[09:48:38] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Let us know how you really feel.
[09:48:49] <DaveMethvin> grrr
[09:49:15] <DaveMethvin> that's all we need, another four or five paragraphs of exceptions in the ajax docs explaining why shit doesn't work right
[09:49:33] <scott_gonzalez> Stop fighting it and be true to your values.
[09:49:48] <scott_gonzalez> It must land in core ASAP!
[09:50:08] <scott_gonzalez> I don't really understand what that guy was talking about.
[09:50:11] <DaveMethvin> good point. we're at rc but come to think of it we neeed some exciting features
[09:50:21] <DaveMethvin> 1.8 needs this!
[09:50:22] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:50:40] <scott_gonzalez> New since the RC: browser-specific APis exposed!
[09:50:51] <DaveMethvin> he thinks we need xdr or we're not "cross-browser"
[09:51:12] <DaveMethvin> so somehow we need to turn xdr into xhr2
[09:51:18] <DaveMethvin> and make it work for ie6/7
[09:51:44] <DaveMethvin> oh the dev meeting
[09:51:47] <DaveMethvin> oh
[09:52:01] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, dev meeting in 10
[10:05:30] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez is that in -meeting or skype?
[10:05:38] <scott_gonzalez> skype
[10:05:42] <rwaldron> ugh
[10:05:46] <rwaldron> such a PITA on this end
[10:05:57] <rwaldron> I can't do skype calls in the middle of the office
[10:06:26] <rwaldron> and there is currently no "free zones" anywhere in the loft
[10:06:36] <snover> pillow talk rwaldron
[10:06:45] <rwaldron> I cant wait to move
[10:06:53] <rwaldron> this shit wont be such a goddamn hassle
[10:10:56] <scott_gonzalez> It's nice and quiet in my hammock chair on my porch :-P
[11:07:24] <DaveMethvin> is anyone else bugged by the new github notifications?
[11:07:48] <DaveMethvin> when i watch something i can't have some of them go email and others just web
[11:08:19] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: You can have different email profiles.
[11:08:37] <scott_gonzalez> Wait, what do you want?
[11:08:46] <DaveMethvin> i want to get email notices on jquery core but not for modernizr for example even though i do want to watch it
[11:09:39] <DaveMethvin> so there is one big switch for "Watching" and one for "Participating" but no way to select email for some watches and web for others
[11:10:10] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: email address
[11:10:47] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Isn't that what stars are for?
[11:10:50] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: thats the best you get, send the updates you don't care about to an email you never check
[11:10:57] <DaveMethvin> lol yeah
[11:11:10] <DaveMethvin> exactly what ARE stars for?
[11:12:27] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: ping
[11:12:27] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/f8bdd6e1927c0a08a7397ab57247c3d99cf6f1ed#commitcomment-1686304
[11:12:28] <socialhapy> ★ Github API: no commit found
[11:12:30] <scott_gonzalez> Stars are what watching used to be.
[11:12:33] <Krinkle> what is there asynchronous about walk() ? Looks completely straight to me
[11:12:55] <Krinkle> Yeah, now watching means "send me notifications" and star is "I love this, bump that counter"
[11:12:55] <scott_gonzalez> Line 379 is async.
[11:13:19] <scott_gonzalez> Because `method` is async.
[11:13:30] <Krinkle> oh, it passes it as a callback
[11:13:47] <DaveMethvin> > A quick note: activity from starred repositories will not show up in your dashboard feed.
[11:14:00] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: You've been owned by GitHub.
[11:14:09] <DaveMethvin> clearly :)
[11:14:09] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: you want it in your dashboard, but not in your email?
[11:14:12] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: that wasn't very obvious at first.. Anyway, why does it have to be recursive though ?
[11:14:18] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: yeah
[11:14:19] <Krinkle> can't next() call method( next ) again ?
[11:14:34] <Krinkle> (with a shift() as well, I suppose).
[11:14:46] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: make a rule in gmail to just immediately archive messages w/ subject starts with [modernizr] ?
[11:14:53] <Krinkle> the tail recursion seems a bit nasty, but a lot less evil than I thought since it is async.
[11:14:58] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: or the second email idea
[11:15:07] <scott_gonzalez> Why are you worried about recursion?
[11:15:14] <Krinkle> I'm not. Never mind.
[11:15:29] <gnarf> I really wish I could figure out how to shut off whatever it is that makes gnarf@jquery.com receive every comment/issue from jquery mobile
[11:15:55] <gnarf> of course, i haven't tried cuz I just filtered it in gmail
[11:16:13] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Check https://github.com/watching
[11:16:51] <gnarf> nope
[11:16:56] <gnarf> its getting sent to the infra team
[11:16:58] <gnarf> for some reason
[11:17:28] <gnarf> jqdeploy <jqdeploy@jquery.com>
[11:17:33] <gnarf> ^^^ thats the dude
[11:19:39] <gnarf> also - github notification threads are really easily filtered in gmail
[11:19:53] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/423X0P2z000b
[11:19:57] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: ^^^
[11:20:25] <DaveMethvin> right, so i can filter-permanently-delete them and leave web notification on
[11:20:25] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Is it something in http://jquerymobile.com/gitpostcommit.php ?
[11:20:50] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: yeah
[11:20:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah i was thinking your email is probably coming from the hook
[11:21:06] <gnarf> why would a hook get an issue comment
[11:21:08] <gnarf> its the issues
[11:21:12] <gnarf> not the commits
[11:21:38] <gnarf> like i love mobile and all, but i don't want the firehose of issues
[11:21:41] <gnarf> :)
[11:23:54] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: jqdeploy is a GitHub user who is on the jQuery Mobile team.
[11:23:59] <scott_gonzalez> That would be why.
[11:24:14] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: that dude... ;)
[11:41:16] <Krinkle> Woot: http://about.travis-ci.org/blog/pull-request-testing-for-everyone/
[11:41:47] <Krinkle> "Up until now, Pull Request testing was only available for Open Source projects. "
[11:41:55] <Krinkle> wait, what? It wasn't donators only already?
[11:41:57] <Krinkle> awesome
[12:53:03] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/dmethvin/jquery/commit/7dbd2f5acd149caa4151175c09b2d593ea3e1aed
[12:53:04] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by Dave Methvin (1h, 18m ago): Update to use just the MIT license; copiers can still use GPL.
[12:53:54] <ben_alman> copiers?
[12:54:13] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/dmethvin/jquery/blob/master/src/intro.js#L6
[12:55:12] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: oh yeah i meant to ask about that, since it also impacts sizzle
[12:55:23] <DaveMethvin> so sizzle is down to mit and bsd?
[12:55:29] <scott_gonzalez> Sizzle should just be MIT.
[12:55:34] <scott_gonzalez> everything should be MIT.
[12:56:55] <DaveMethvin> and scott_gonzalez the copyright for sizzle should be jQuery foundation?
[12:57:25] <DaveMethvin> it would have to be if we're changing the terms
[12:57:40] <ben_alman> why not use BSD instead of MIT
[12:57:52] <ben_alman> BSD has the added benefit of bein unambiguous
[12:57:58] <ben_alman> whereas MIT is ambiguous
[12:58:05] <ben_alman> (of course with a license file, it's not)
[12:58:12] <DaveMethvin> and we have one of those
[12:58:23] <ben_alman> yes
[12:59:23] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman: Why should we become more restrictive just to remove ambiguity in discussion?
[13:00:01] <scott_gonzalez> Also, one could argue that BSD is more ambiguous than MIT.
[13:00:09] <ben_alman> ok then!
[13:00:44] <scott_gonzalez> ISC is unambiguous though :-)
[13:00:53] <DaveMethvin> i really dislike licenses. take my code and do whatever you want license
[13:01:02] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin wants the WTFPL
[13:01:13] <snover> WTFPL: 0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.
[13:01:15] <snover> yes
[13:01:17] <snover> thanks scott
[13:01:18] <ben_alman> the problem with that DaveMethvin is that then they actually CAN'T use it
[13:01:20] <DaveMethvin> LMTFA license
[13:01:21] <ben_alman> heh
[13:01:46] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman: Why not?
[13:02:08] <ben_alman> apparently licenses have to do certain things to make them "free"
[13:02:11] <ben_alman> i don't know the details
[13:02:18] <ben_alman> it is confusing to me
[13:02:21] <snover> wait what?
[13:02:32] <ben_alman> i probably misunderstood
[13:03:24] <DaveMethvin> ben_alman: like "all rights reserved" unless otherwise said or something like that
[13:03:38] <DaveMethvin> take my code, PLEASE
[13:03:46] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman: WTFPL is free and can be held up in court.
[13:03:52] <ben_alman> ok cool then
[13:04:10] <DaveMethvin> i'd love to see that court transcript
[13:04:32] <DaveMethvin> "your honor, the plaintiff clearly said they could do whatever the fuck they wanted"
[13:04:37] <scott_gonzalez> FSF has approved WTFPL as GPL compatible, so we can totally switch to WTFPL if we want.
[13:04:42] <ben_alman> i just want to use whatever someone tells me
[13:05:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'm a license lemming
[13:05:57] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: since you've researched this ... do we actually NEED the (c) thing? we only have it  one copyright in intro.js anyway
[13:06:28] <scott_gonzalez> No, the (c) is meaningless. It has zero legal meaning.
[13:06:46] <ben_alman> do you need a date?
[13:06:50] <ben_alman> what exactly do you need?
[13:06:59] <ben_alman> i'd love to update all my grunt:init templates
[13:07:18] <scott_gonzalez> Most people don't follow the technical rules for dates.
[13:07:40] <DaveMethvin> remember now, ben_alman, scott_gonzalez is not a lawyer and is not qualified to give legal advice :D
[13:07:59] <DaveMethvin> stfu socialhapy
[13:11:12] <peol> sorry DaveMethvin, people love to abuse a bug that crashes him
[13:11:52] <DaveMethvin> i thought bot cruelty was outlawed in 2006
[13:12:07] <gnarf> sorry - but i like to 👊 punch socialhapy
[13:12:33] <gnarf> also, those characters are just fun to use
[13:12:34] <ryanneufeld> and I've been 👊 bumping gnarf
[13:13:09] <gnarf> 🐒👊 <-- makes me wish they had defined a duck in this block
[13:13:27] <peol> ...
[13:14:00] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman: You're supposed to put the date of first publication, I believe.
[13:14:31] <ben_alman> o rly
[13:14:32] <scott_gonzalez> But I don't know the full details about dates.
[13:14:33] <ben_alman> had no idea
[13:15:23] <scott_gonzalez> I think if you release a new version, that maybe you're supposed to include the year of that release as well if it differs.
[13:15:30] <DaveMethvin> ok that does it gnarf and ryanneufeld, i'm turning this car around and we're going back
[13:15:35] <gnarf> heheh
[13:15:35] <scott_gonzalez> So like Copyright 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008 Ben Alman
[13:15:42] <ryanneufeld> haha
[13:15:47] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure about that though.
[13:15:53] <ryanneufeld> I just lost it....
[13:15:58] <scott_gonzalez> It's been a while since I read about copyright dates.
[13:16:18] <DaveMethvin> or Copyright 2006-2012 perhaps?
[13:16:30] <DaveMethvin> i think i've seen that on microsoft files
[13:16:37] <DaveMethvin> and you KNOW they have lawyers
[13:17:36] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I think that technically you're not supposed to list ranges.
[13:17:38] <gnarf> but if you didn't release in 2007, it'd be 2006, 2008-2012
[13:17:57] <scott_gonzalez> I think dates are mostly irrelevant for copyright (other than first publication).
[13:18:02] <gnarf> book publishers often list each year
[13:18:19] <scott_gonzalez> At least for new (within past 30 years) software.
[13:18:45] <scott_gonzalez> Since copyright is no longer 14 years since first publication, but rather author life + many years.
[13:19:08] <DaveMethvin> in the usa, copyright length is whatever disney wants plus 20 years
[13:19:33] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[13:19:47] <scott_gonzalez> Corporations are 95 years, I think.
[13:20:05] <DaveMethvin> so scott_gonzalez is the "official" version in the jquery ui project the one in package.json? and then createBanner() uses that?
[13:20:22] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:20:24] <DaveMethvin> k
[13:25:04] <DaveMethvin> so scott_gonzalez how about this for the header? There's no reason to repeat the copyright since it's now the same
[13:27:53] <DaveMethvin> https://gist.github.com/3298322
[13:27:59] <DaveMethvin> oh forgot to hit enter ..
[13:29:36] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's probably fine.
[14:11:31] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I know it's been discussed before, but is performance of $.support a concern?
[14:11:41] <scott_gonzalez> I recall discussions, just not any details.
[14:11:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah it is
[14:11:54] <DaveMethvin> we were moving towards making it lazier
[14:11:58] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin this cloned elem style things...
[14:12:00] <DaveMethvin> only doing feature detects on first use
[14:12:01] <rwaldron> thing*
[14:12:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I just had an idea (which you've probably already thought of)...
[14:12:23] <scott_gonzalez> Using getters for 2.0.
[14:12:32] <rwaldron> accessors*
[14:12:35] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez: ^^
[14:12:39] <scott_gonzalez> whatever :-P
[14:12:44] <rwaldron> no such thing as "getters"
[14:12:58] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe not in ES5/6, but somewhere...
[14:13:06] <DaveMethvin> oh i have such a fun set of things for 2.0!
[14:13:07] <scott_gonzalez> defineGetter is what always pops into my head.
[14:13:47] <DaveMethvin> once we drop the ie 6/7/8 stuff there are lots of fun things we can do
[14:14:00] * rwaldron can't wait
[14:14:06] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's gonna be fun
[14:14:54] <DaveMethvin> so rwaldron is there a way to set the __proto__ of an object?
[14:15:06] <DaveMethvin> in the standard that is
[14:15:17] <rwaldron> ES6 will have __proto__
[14:15:23] <DaveMethvin> writable?
[14:15:32] <rwaldron> it won in favor of that insane <| thing
[14:15:37] <rwaldron> I believe yes
[14:15:39] <rwaldron> let me confirm
[14:16:12] <DaveMethvin> i was thinking of how we might be able to clean up the jQuery.event.fix() stuff
[14:16:33] <DaveMethvin> and if we could just create an object and later set its __proto__ i think we'd have it
[14:17:10] <rwaldron> Somehow I think there is probably a better way
[14:17:29] <rwaldron> I have a branch that eliminates fix
[14:17:37] <rwaldron> hm. almost*
[14:17:45] <rwaldron> it requires no copying
[14:17:53] <DaveMethvin> with the event object the problem is that we need to write at least temporarily to the event object to overwrite some stuff though ... don't we/
[14:17:54] <DaveMethvin> ?
[14:17:59] <rwaldron> remember we hashed that out in Virginia?
[14:18:06] <rwaldron> no
[14:18:18] <DaveMethvin> i remember we talked about it but there was that "almost" part :D
[14:18:18] <rwaldron> the properties are all configurable
[14:19:13] <DaveMethvin> well i think we are very close there, it would be awesome to not copy anything and just use a modified event object
[14:19:24] <rwaldron> the "almost
[14:19:26] <rwaldron>  ack
[14:19:39] <rwaldron> the "almost" part was just that we needed to calculate "which"
[14:20:03] <DaveMethvin> as long as its not a property already on the event that is read only, we're okay
[14:20:33] <rwaldron> I'm curious to know what modern browser has read-only props on their event objects
[14:20:50] <rwaldron> and what props those are
[14:20:54] <DaveMethvin> i think it was chrome, i did an experiment
[14:20:57] <DaveMethvin> there is that strange behavior that if  you have a read-only property on the prototype, you can't set the own property
[14:20:57] <rwaldron> we need a data collection
[14:21:43] <DaveMethvin> i think i created a fiddle, lemme look for it
[14:22:32] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin the override mistake
[14:22:40] <rwaldron> unnnnfixable
[14:22:53] <rwaldron> but yeah, I know whatcha mean
[14:22:59] <DaveMethvin> what if you set the property, *then* set the __proto__ :
[14:23:07] <rwaldron> I just mean "let's get a specific list collected"
[14:23:44] <DaveMethvin> that's why i wanted a writable __proto__
[14:23:54] <DaveMethvin> to get around the read-only proto property
[14:24:04] <DaveMethvin> the old switcherooo
[14:24:16] <rwaldron> hm.
[14:24:36] <rwaldron> I still think this can be done without __proto__
[14:26:27] <DaveMethvin> you may be right rwaldron, that would be  heavenly
[14:26:32] <DaveMethvin> i can't find my fiddle
[14:37:24] <snover> DaveMethvin: You can, you have to use Object.defineProperty
[14:38:27] <snover> var obj = delegate(someFrozenCrap); Object.defineProperty(obj, "someProperty", { value: "overwritten lol", enumerable: true, configurable: true, thatOtherOneThatIForgot: true })
[14:38:35] <DaveMethvin> snover: what if they set the property to configurable: false though?
[14:38:42] <DaveMethvin> it has to be configurable
[14:38:45] <DaveMethvin> i think
[14:39:01] <snover> The [defective] part of the spec is [[CanPut]]
[14:42:39] <Gho5t> does the jquery team stipulate a coding convention for single vs double quotes
[15:00:46] <gnarf> wow - not even 20 minutes of patience?
[15:01:00] <gnarf> double quotes always in jQuery Style Guide
[17:04:53] <gnarf> Krinkle: btw Chrome 21 is stable today
[17:05:09] <Krinkle> has been for almost a week
[17:05:30] <gnarf> didn't know if you were the one thats been updating swarm/stack browsers
[17:05:43] <Krinkle> there's nothing to update yet, we stuck on a dependency chain
[17:05:47] <gnarf> I'd do it myself if I understood how to - is there a walkthrough on adding a version yet?
[17:06:53] <gnarf> clarkbox: btw - can you make me an admin on clarkbox/testswarm-browserstack ? I'll try to move it over to jquery/
[17:07:32] <Krinkle> 1) jquery/testswarm -- config/useragents.ini  (which requires our ua-parser supports it) and to browserSets.default in config/testswarm-default.json, 2) testswarm-browserack map.js (which requires browserstack supports it), 3) ssh jq03, config/testswarm.json browserSets.popular (rm/add)
[17:08:02] <Krinkle> in that order, don't continue a sequential step until the previous one is fixed, merged and deployed, or stuff will explode
[17:16:35] <gnarf> Krinkle: sounds good
[17:17:00] <gnarf> Krinkle: i assume part 1 was the "stuck on a dependency chain" part?
[17:17:00] <Krinkle> getting it into jquery management (or me having commit access) would make that easier
[17:17:09] <Krinkle> I believe so, yes.
[17:17:18] <Krinkle> browserstack has added it finally
[17:17:28] <Krinkle> but they're doing a bad job at making the api key sane
[17:17:40] <Krinkle> they're including 'b' or 'd' for beta/dev version
[17:17:51] <Krinkle> which means we have to update map.js once it becomes stable, which is insane imho.
[17:17:52] <gnarf> Krinkle: did you ever start on your rewrite / did you find anything in my rewrite useful?
[17:17:58] <Krinkle> and often outdated too.
[17:18:12] <Krinkle> I did, I'm almost done. got delayed by my recovery of the jetlag.
[17:18:20] <gnarf> :+1:
[17:18:21] <Krinkle> Just got back in Europe
[17:18:39] <Krinkle> 21 is still id'ed in bs as 21.0b
[17:19:48] <gnarf> Krinkle: that is pretty lame - so eventually whenever BS updates we gotta drop the "b" again
[17:25:22] <Krinkle> yep
[17:25:28] <Krinkle> that took out the swarm a few times now
[17:25:33] <Krinkle> or rather it took out jenkins
[17:25:40] <Krinkle> since the job will time out since one browser doesn't run
[17:25:46] <Krinkle> I already asked them to drop it
[17:25:59] <Krinkle> but they've added 22.0 now, and guess what it has 22.0d as id.
[17:26:25] <Krinkle> could be better in APIv2
[17:26:31] <Krinkle> but we're not using that yet (we should)
[17:26:33] <Krinkle> let me check there
[17:26:53] <Krinkle> nope
[17:26:53] <Krinkle> {"version":"22.0d","browser":"chrome"}
[18:16:35] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: It's important because 22.0d and 22.0b and 22.0 are actually different builds.
[18:17:08] <gnarf> Krinkle: beta / dev channel builds
[18:17:11] <gnarf> obvs
[18:17:13] <Krinkle> I know
[18:17:22] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: didn't you say that node-browserstack was updated for api2?
[18:17:36] <Krinkle> it is, but testswarm-browserstack doesn't use it yet
[18:17:39] <gnarf> aha
[18:17:54] <Krinkle> we'll have to update the map and figure out how to deal with the no-longer-flat descriptor
[18:17:56] <gnarf> can you retrieve that list dynamically?
[18:18:03] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Yup: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-browserstack/commit/c686d7ea0216722821d0ed514a589e7eb5d04738 (3 months ago)
[18:18:14] <Krinkle> api.browserstack/[1-2]/browsers
[18:18:18] <Krinkle> api.browserstack.com/[1-2]/browsers
[18:18:28] <gnarf> because we could just detect the map for the most part right?
[18:18:36] <Krinkle> v2 has an extra dimension for pseudo-os
[18:18:51] <Krinkle> its not really os, e.g. 'opera' is inverted
[18:18:56] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: node-browserstack flattens the list.
[18:19:02] <Krinkle> good
[18:19:15] <scott_gonzalez> I also complained about the pseduo-os to them.
[18:19:23] <gnarf> browser name is pretty consistent - version number, prefer shortest
[18:19:40] <gnarf> and/or alphabetically smallest
[18:20:19] <scott_gonzalez> node-browerstack also supports { browser: "chrome", version: "latest" }
[18:20:34] <Krinkle> including b/d?
[18:20:52] <scott_gonzalez> no, only stable
[18:21:16] <gnarf> there has to be some way we could make a better detection of the browser/version maps
[18:21:27] <gnarf> so we wouldn't have to manually map as much
[18:30:26] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Did you try recompiling?
[18:31:22] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: not yet - todays attempts to get jquery work done were rudely interrupted with requests from the day job
[18:31:31] <scott_gonzalez> boo
[18:31:55] <gnarf> yeah - like right as i started into it (on two occasions) there were things they needed me to figure out
[18:32:39] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I tried it and it worked for me :-)
[18:32:45] <gnarf> i'd start now, but really - i don't think I'll get any substantial groove started
[18:32:52] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: awesome - good to know
[18:33:01] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: the servers always curl nave's master anyway
[18:33:08] <scott_gonzalez> Also, nave uninstall 0.8.3 && nave install 0.8.3 is super fast
[18:33:40] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, I've got nave cloned and then symlinked into /usr/local/bin/
[18:33:58] <scott_gonzalez> So it's just a `git pull` in my nave checkout.
[18:34:38] <scott_gonzalez> So that's one less problem.
[18:34:55] <scott_gonzalez> Getting closer to 0.8 support
[20:31:21] <Krinkle> Total hot sauce! "Notifications that are read as HTML email are automatically marked as read in the github.com notifications interface."
[20:31:28] <Krinkle> I've hated that sooo much, duplication of efforts.
[20:31:42] <Krinkle> Now fixed
