[04:41:21] <w5> join #jquery
[07:01:04] <Insanity5902> A good handful of the sites are down. Has anybody had a chance to look
[07:01:30] <ajpiano> no, i hadn't heard.... which ?
[07:02:50] <Insanity5902> Seems to all the site son blog.jquery.com
[07:02:51] <Insanity5902> 70.32.73.126
[07:03:13] <Insanity5902> sizzlejs.com, jquery.org, jquery14.org, blog. and events.
[07:03:52] <Insanity5902> server responds to ssh, just no apapche running :/
[07:04:36] <ajpiano> do you have the wherewithal to restart apache on that box?
[07:04:43] <Insanity5902> LOL, just did
[07:04:51] <ajpiano> sweet, thanks!!
[07:04:58] <Insanity5902> I was hitting up here first to make sure no one was working on it
[07:05:18] <ajpiano> much appreciated Insanity5902 :)
[07:13:22] <Insanity5902> In case someone wants to dive into it at 04:47:54 server time , the httpd error.log started to log (12)Cannot allocate memory: apr_socket_accept: (client socket)
[07:14:04] <danheberden> Insanity5902 thanks for restarting that
[07:14:10] <Insanity5902> and last response was 04:52 with [emerg] (22)Invalid argument: couldn't grab the accept mutex
[07:14:19] <Insanity5902> lots of simliar messages inbetween the times
[07:14:26] <danheberden> normally mysql is what exhausts the memory on the box
[07:17:18] <Insanity5902> this might of been an issue with the hard or soft limits for the apache user?
[07:18:25] <Insanity5902> anyways, it's up. Feel free to ping me if you need anything else
[08:48:22] <mbutubuntu> hello folks, I'd like to make you an advanced javascript question... is it possible to create a sort of sub-method of a method?
[08:48:40] <mbutubuntu> for example myObj.method().subMethod();
[08:49:07] <mbutubuntu> in which subMethod() exixts only if called "after" the method()
[08:49:32] <ajpiano> if "method" returns an object that has "subMethod"
[08:49:33] <ajpiano> then yes
[08:50:48] <mbutubuntu> so method() should return two outputs... a value and an object....
[08:50:56] <mbutubuntu> ajpiano, any example? or doc ?
[08:51:00] <ajpiano> huh?
[08:51:05] <ajpiano> things can't return more than one thing
[08:51:07] <ajpiano> at a time
[08:51:36] <mbutubuntu> ajpiano, ok... so method() should return an object...
[08:51:45] <ajpiano> yes
[08:52:23] <mbutubuntu> so I should delegate some submethods for all...
[08:52:36] <ajpiano> not sure what you mean by that
[08:52:59] <mbutubuntu> for example array.maxValue().value() and array.maxValue().position()
[08:53:17] <mbutubuntu> one returning the max value of the array and the other returning the index...
[08:53:20] <mbutubuntu> is it right ?
[08:53:37] <ajpiano> i wouldn't do it like that at all
[08:53:42] <ajpiano> there's no reason for there to be so many method calls
[08:53:53] <mbutubuntu> so maxValue() could outs an array
[08:54:06] <ajpiano> array.maxValue should just return an object with {position: 2, value: "foo"}
[08:54:07] <mbutubuntu> so maxValue().value and maxValue().position
[08:54:13] <ajpiano> yeah, but that's not an array :p
[08:54:17] <mbutubuntu> ajpiano, ok ok, I understand
[08:54:21] <ajpiano> ok
[08:54:26] <mbutubuntu> ajpiano, sorry it was a stupid mistake... :-)
[08:54:34] <mbutubuntu> you were very clear
[08:54:37] <ajpiano> ok :)
[08:54:39] <mbutubuntu> thanks again
[08:54:45] <mbutubuntu> I go
[08:54:56] <ajpiano> in general this chan isn't really for general javascript questions, ok mbutubuntu ?
[10:10:49] <mbutubuntu> ajpiano, I know, I used this chan because #javascript generally is used for basic questions... do you know any js chan for OO js ?
[10:11:12] <ajpiano> i'm sure there are many people in ##javascript who would be happy to discuss more advanced concepts
[10:11:15] <ajpiano> if you asked them :)
[10:11:31] <mbutubuntu> ajpiano, not always :-)
[10:11:58] <ajpiano> welcome to irc :D
[10:12:03] <ajpiano> nothing is always
[10:12:45] <mbutubuntu> ajpiano, I'd like to collaborate jquery, but I'm studying. I'm curious on "how a jquery developer solves a problem" :-)
[10:13:03] <ajpiano> heh :)
[10:13:15] <ajpiano> i mean you can ask that type of stuff in #jquery too i suppose
[10:13:17] <gnarf> mbutubuntu: #jquery ;)
[10:13:41] <mbutubuntu> so it wasn't only a technical question, it was also an "approach" question
[10:14:22] <gnarf> if had been a "how would you solve this in core" it would have been a question for here, the answer to that question is, - we wouldn't bad pattern ;)
[10:14:30] <mbutubuntu> but it wasn't a pure jquery question.... with two words: it's always hard to find the good chan for a question... :-)
[10:15:03] <mbutubuntu> this is my point of view... maybe it's wrong
[10:15:34] <mbutubuntu> now, I have a question surely coherent with this chan
[10:16:06] <mbutubuntu> are you all jquery active developers, do you?
[10:17:26] <ajpiano> in different areas of the project
[10:17:29] <ajpiano> yes
[10:17:47] <mbutubuntu> I massively use jquery, so I think that it could be fair to collaborate jquery...
[10:18:03] <ajpiano> right?
[10:18:08] <ajpiano> are you asking how you can do that?
[10:18:31] <mbutubuntu> ajpiano, not only how....
[10:19:22] <mbutubuntu> my question is a bit more complex: how to discover if I'm prepared to collaborate?
[10:19:51] <ajpiano> you can try to solve the bugs that exist in the bug tracker
[10:20:08] <ajpiano> or you can try to help out in the #jquery channel or in the forum
[10:20:14] <mbutubuntu> I've never studied javascript academically... so I fear to have a gap
[10:20:20] <ajpiano> so that you can bone up on like, figuring out lots of arbitrary jquery problems
[10:20:27] <ajpiano> that's how i got decent at this whole business :)
[10:20:50] <mbutubuntu> ajpiano, ok, it seems a good advice
[10:21:10] <ajpiano> yeah, it worked for me - i studied theatre :D
[10:21:33] <mbutubuntu> :-) I studied electronic music
[10:21:54] <mbutubuntu> some programming but not at high level
[10:22:34] <ajpiano> my background is similar
[10:23:09] <mbutubuntu> it's comforting
[10:23:14] <ajpiano> mbutubuntu: it's like, if you can start to figure out where people have code that USES jQuery that's breaking, you will gradually get better at finding code that is IN jQuery that's breaking
[10:23:30] <ajpiano> cause you will have to learn how the library works to solve the people's problems
[10:23:46] <mbutubuntu> :-)
[10:24:17] <ajpiano> and we can always use the help :)
[10:24:21] <mbutubuntu> Ive tryied to study some jquery sources... but sometimes it's too abstracted... and reading code could be an effort
[10:24:57] <ajpiano> yeah, it helps to have a context of like, how does this particular section of code get executed from the end-user perspective
[10:25:30] <ajpiano> there are a lot of good resources for learning JS as well, starting with see ?101
[10:25:30] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[10:28:09] <gnarf> mbutubuntu: asking whats happening inside a core function, or what the abstraction is doing might be useful for you to learn too, a good chunck of us could probably explain those abstractions to you :)
[10:29:07] <mbutubuntu> thank for your disposability
[10:35:01] <mbutubuntu> ajpiano, can you submit you a piece of code?
[10:35:30] <mbutubuntu> *can I ....
[10:35:41] <ajpiano> for what?
[10:36:38] <mbutubuntu> to have your opinion on it
[10:36:48] <gnarf> mbutubuntu: either way, move the convo to #jquery? :)
[10:37:06] <ajpiano> ^^
[10:37:17] <mbutubuntu> gnarf, ajpiano sorry
[10:37:24] <gnarf> mbutubuntu: drop some code there, ask the channel for opinion :)
[10:40:02] <rwaldron> mbutubuntu just out of curiousity, are you Mohammed Buttu?
[10:40:09] <rwaldron> with a clever name
[10:40:10] <rwaldron> ?
[10:41:05] <mbutubuntu> no, I don't
[10:41:05] * rwaldron afk
[10:57:27] <Insanity5902> danheberden: blog.jquery.com is down again, I can't even reach it via ssh
[11:06:04] <gnarf> Should I even bother trying to finish out this idea jaubourg brought up with raf ?
[11:06:28] <gnarf> I could probably have a solid working example of a "scheduler" setTimeout loop to fix #9381
[11:06:34] <gnarf> by the end of the week
[11:37:53] <rwaldron> ajpiano gnarf dig it...
[11:37:55] <rwaldron> ?involved
[11:37:56] <bot-t> http://docs.jquery.com/Getting_Involved
[11:38:17] <ajpiano> ...awesome
[11:38:18] <ajpiano> :D
[11:38:21] <rwaldron> a nice follow up to
[11:38:24] <rwaldron> ?jqbugz
[11:38:25] <bot-t> https://gist.github.com/672714
[11:38:48] <ajpiano> yeah
[11:38:55] <ajpiano> i think my jqcon preso will just be me slowly reading this
[11:39:00] <ajpiano> duhhh
[11:39:02] <rwaldron> and...
[11:39:08] <rwaldron> ?style
[11:39:09] <bot-t> http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines
[11:39:32] <ajpiano> did you do all this just now?
[11:40:50] <gnarf> so, couple of points
[11:40:54] <gnarf> Exception: foo(true) (no spaces) is allowed if you're already inside of another function call.
[11:41:06] <gnarf> "is allowed" is not "is required"
[11:41:11] <rwaldron> truth
[11:41:11] <gnarf> :)
[11:41:24] <gnarf> but i constantly get called out on that one
[11:41:33] <gnarf> because I usually keep the spacing consistent internally
[11:41:37] <rwaldron> outer( inner("foo") ) is ok, as is: outer( inner( "foo" ) )
[11:41:55] <gnarf> i prefer the second and have been called out on it a few times :)
[11:42:04] <rwaldron> by me?
[11:42:07] <rwaldron> tell me to shut up
[11:42:18] <rwaldron> ie. remind me that either are allowed
[11:42:39] <rwaldron> i'm not perfect damnit.
[11:43:36] <gnarf> nah, don't shut up, was just pointing it out ;)
[11:45:16] <ajpiano> Insanity5902: you around
[12:01:17] <Insanity5902> ajpiano: i am now
[12:01:31] <ajpiano> seems like it's broken again :/
[12:01:34] <ajpiano> can you take a gander
[12:01:43] <ajpiano> well, i guess you noticed that :p
[12:01:51] <ajpiano> oh but now you can't ssh
[12:01:54] <ajpiano> that is badddddddddddd
[12:01:59] <Insanity5902> lol, yeah. SSH is responive now
[12:02:03] <Insanity5902> same thing httpd is dead
[12:02:03] <ajpiano> oh phew
[12:02:47] <ajpiano> restart it
[12:02:52] <ajpiano> i guess
[12:03:15] <ajpiano> i guess we'll have to get to the bottom of it sooner rather than later though
[12:03:36] <Insanity5902> Yeah .. not looking good
[12:03:47] <Insanity5902> just putting nginx in front of it might be enough
[12:04:03] <rwaldron> timmywil i think you broke jQuery.
[12:04:14] <rwaldron> css and effects tests are busted like crazy
[12:04:46] <timmywil> rwaldron: really? I ran every browser and they were fine
[12:04:54] <rwaldron> maybe false positie
[12:04:56] <rwaldron> positive*
[12:05:39] <timmywil> rwaldron: which browser are you in?
[12:06:18] <rwaldron> one sec
[12:07:48] <rwaldron> chrome, opera, safari
[12:07:53] <rwaldron> should i keep going?
[12:09:42] <rwaldron> as soon as I remove your changes, everything is fine
[12:09:45] <rwaldron> just the one commit
[12:10:00] <rwaldron> this concerns me
[12:10:33] <timmywil> full suite or per module
[12:10:40] <rwaldron> full on bro
[12:10:43] <rwaldron> and per module
[12:10:51] <rwaldron> ?filter=effects
[12:10:56] <bot-t> rwaldron, filter | jQuery Plugins - This plugin create a fading effect for image on mouse over. In addition, you can select a color tone filter for your images. The tone is set for the images, when they are not hovered. When it is ho... http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/filter
[12:11:36] <timmywil> I see a fail for selector: pseudo - position
[12:11:45] <rwaldron> dude
[12:11:50] <rwaldron> 3 browsers
[12:11:58] <rwaldron> all reporting the same failures
[12:12:08] <Insanity5902> this server is getting pounded
[12:12:14] <timmywil> which tests?
[12:12:18] <Insanity5902> cpu is avg around 85%
[12:12:26] <rwaldron> fffffuuuuuuuuuuuu
[12:12:28] <Insanity5902> load average: 14.58, 15.00, 9.36
[12:12:29] <rwaldron> one sec
[12:12:33] <rwaldron> i'll get screen caps
[12:13:44] <timmywil> I have full passes for the css module in all browsers (with full suite).  I do see opacity errors in Chrome and Firefox.  And I have all but full passes in IE6-8 except for one selector fail.
[12:13:58] <timmywil> opacity errors are in effects btw
[12:14:06] <rwaldron> see above
[12:14:09] <rwaldron> where i said...
[12:14:14] <rwaldron> ?fitler=effects
[12:14:15] <bot-t> rwaldron, .filter() - Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[12:14:17] <rwaldron> filter*
[12:14:23] <timmywil> you said css and effects
[12:14:57] <rwaldron> The issue across the board is that you've set these to expect 1
[12:15:03] <rwaldron> and that's not what they return
[12:15:09] <rwaldron> 0.5 and 0
[12:15:30] <rwaldron> i dunno why you're getting snarky with me
[12:15:37] <timmywil> ?
[12:15:39] <rwaldron> i'm definitly here to help
[12:15:42] <timmywil> i'm not
[12:15:48] <rwaldron> ok
[12:16:02] <rwaldron> well.. forget i said that then
[12:16:32] <timmywil> so you remove the commit that changes the effects tests and everything passes for you?
[12:17:30] <rwaldron> timmywil yep
[12:17:50] <rwaldron> well, i just commented out the if(){} and then changed css=>style
[12:17:54] <rwaldron> and it works
[12:18:09] <timmywil> ok, that will fail in IE tho
[12:18:35] <timmywil> I'm surprised I got effects module-only passes across the board
[12:18:42] <rwaldron> just a heads up, i've repro'd this on two machines now... osx and winxp
[12:18:54] <timmywil> i believe you
[12:18:55] <rwaldron> in IE
[12:18:57] <rwaldron> ?
[12:19:00] <rwaldron> that passes?
[12:19:26] <timmywil> ya no fails in IE right now, but if it fails in Chrome/Firefox/etc, something will need to change
[12:19:37] <rwaldron> yeah def
[12:19:46] <rwaldron> so you're seeing them correct?
[12:19:56] <timmywil> yes I see them when I run the full suite
[12:20:36] <rwaldron> (btw, unrelated sort of, that css error you saw, that needs to be updated in Sizzle's selector tests)
[12:20:41] <rwaldron> word
[12:20:53] <rwaldron> I can confirm IE is good
[12:21:01] <rwaldron> but you knew that
[12:21:05] <timmywil> the pseudo - position test?
[12:21:19] <rwaldron> yeah
[12:21:22] <rwaldron> i think?
[12:21:27] <timmywil> just cause html got added?
[12:21:28] <rwaldron> maybe i'm thinking of something else
[12:21:30] <rwaldron> yes
[12:21:35] <timmywil> yea
[12:21:37] <timmywil> makes sense
[12:21:41] <rwaldron> i think the index is off or soemthing
[12:21:45] <rwaldron> no biggie
[12:22:19] <timmywil> the effects issues were originally caused by the patch to remove the filter when unnecessary
[12:22:36] <timmywil> jQuery.style(opacity) will return an empty string instead of 1 in IE
[12:22:41] <rwaldron> i figured
[12:22:55] <rwaldron> gonna try something
[12:25:22] <rwaldron> timmywil was that patch meant to only enhance IE?
[12:25:27] <rwaldron> for IE*?
[12:25:57] <timmywil> yea, it was meant to fix effects tests concerning opacity filters
[12:26:10] <rwaldron> i meant the original patch
[12:26:11] <timmywil> i see what's happening tho
[12:26:14] <danheberden> Insanity5902 did you have any luck yet?
[12:26:35] <rwaldron> " the effects issues were originally caused by the patch to remove the filter when unnecessary"
[12:26:41] <timmywil> oh yes, gnarf's work.
[12:26:42] <Insanity5902> well see, seems the server is gettig hit hard. kill our 'beans'
[12:26:44] <rwaldron> ok
[12:27:07] <Insanity5902>  /proc/user_beancounters is showing a large failcount
[12:27:18] <gnarf> yeah
[12:27:31] <gnarf> should only have targeted IE
[12:27:44] <rwaldron> timmywil perhaps we shouldn't be trying to test _other_ browsers with the same condition
[12:27:47] <gnarf> i thought the cssHoks get did an || 1
[12:27:48] * rwaldron shrugs?
[12:27:51] <Insanity5902> i lowered apache servlimit from 256 to 128
[12:28:01] <Insanity5902> (thought I'd go ahead an dkeep base2
[12:28:32] <timmywil> gnarf: you did fine, but the effects test checks for what is set in the style tag
[12:28:37] <danheberden> thanks for addressing it Insanity5902
[12:28:41] <gnarf> timmywil: ahh
[12:28:41] <timmywil> so it needed updated
[12:28:42] <gnarf> right
[12:28:48] <Insanity5902> yeah, keeps http, but your page might no load :/
[12:28:52] <gnarf> sorry i missed that
[12:28:54] <rwaldron> gnarf timmywil maybe the test should only modify the empty string val in IE...?
[12:29:06] <Insanity5902> need to go in and put nginx in front of it to handle the large requst like we did on the others
[12:29:15] <Insanity5902> i Just don't have the time the next 3 - 4 days to do this
[12:29:23] <rwaldron> and leave it alone in the browsers that don't fuck it up
[12:29:36] <rwaldron> (keep in mind i hate that idea)
[12:30:08] <timmywil> gonna see if I can't fix it without doing that yet :)
[12:30:33] <rwaldron> <3
[12:30:36] <rwaldron> please do
[12:31:02] <gnarf> you could base the expected value of "style" for opacity: 1 on the value of "style" for opacity: 0 right?
[12:31:22] <rwaldron> good call
[12:31:30] <rwaldron> like, the default value?
[12:31:35] <rwaldron> errr... no
[12:31:39] <rwaldron> thats not right
[12:31:49] <rwaldron> but yeah, i think your idea makes sense
[12:31:51] <gnarf> well you have 2 "valid" values for style right?
[12:32:02] <gnarf> one is "opacity: 0" the other is "filter: alpha(0)"
[12:32:10] <gnarf> or whatever ie uses
[12:32:27] <gnarf> if you got "filter: alpha(0)" you expect "" for opacity 1, otherwise you expect "opacity: 1"
[12:35:33] <timmywil> I'm going a slightly different direction.  If jQuery.style returns an empty string, fall back to the computed value.
[12:35:49] <timmywil> which should still verfiy that the animation is doing what it should
[12:35:50] <rwaldron> same here
[12:36:00] <rwaldron> took gnarf's idea then started exploring
[12:36:41] <timmywil> gnarf: is it possible you remove the filter even when set to something between 0 and 1?
[12:37:43] <timmywil> no doesn't look like it
[12:37:49] <timmywil> hmm
[12:39:14] <gnarf> timmywil: solid points 2-4 on that forum post btw
[12:39:23] <gnarf> but the #1 and conclusion still have issues with me
[12:39:48] <gnarf> i agree its still drafted, but if it wasn't for jQuery using it, I wouldn't even know this existed :)
[12:44:07] <timmywil> gnarf: raf should make animations smoother. They won't run when out of focus, but that may become true of all timers in the future.
[12:46:03] <rwaldron> check it...
[12:46:19] <timmywil> rwaldron: you got a patch?
[12:46:26] <rwaldron> i think so
[12:46:39] <rwaldron> lemme double check and i'll pusha branch for you to beat on
[12:46:44] <timmywil> cool
[12:51:30] <timmywil> keep hitting problems with opacity must be reset to 0.5
[12:51:35] <rwaldron> i nailed it
[12:51:38] <rwaldron> one sc
[12:54:15] <rwaldron> timmywil https://github.com/rwldrn/jquery/tree/opacity-fubar
[12:54:22] <timmywil> lol
[12:54:25] <timmywil> nice naming
[12:54:36] <rwaldron> git pull git://github.com/rwldrn/jquery.git opacity-fubar
[12:54:41] <rwaldron> hahah :)
[12:55:12] <rwaldron> i wish github had a "generate useful commands" ... "thing"
[12:55:52] <rwaldron> like... one click to copy "git checkout -b opacity-fubar && git pull git://github.com/rwldrn/jquery.git opacity-fubar"
[12:56:18] <rwaldron> would pump my gnads
[12:59:37] <timmywil> rwaldron: nice work, running full suites
[13:00:34] <rwaldron> cool
[13:00:47] <rwaldron> Should i file a pull request?
[13:00:54] <timmywil> yea
[13:01:00] <rwaldron> word
[13:01:15] <rwaldron> eek
[13:01:21] <rwaldron> let me remove that extra line in there
[13:02:50] <rwaldron> and err... maybe add some effing curly braces
[13:05:10] <timmywil> heh rwaldron: renaming that duplicate test in offset made the full suite hang
[13:05:36] <rwaldron> saaayyy what?
[13:05:41] <rwaldron> line?
[13:05:48] <timmywil> the name is used to retrieve the html file for an iframe
[13:06:01] <timmywil> so stop() then 404'd
[13:06:08] <rwaldron> wtf.
[13:06:09] <timmywil> no big deal
[13:06:29] <rwaldron> is that from the "OMG duplicate tests!!!" commits?
[13:06:30] <timmywil> but all of the offset tests are in an iframe
[13:06:41] <timmywil> ya
[13:06:44] <danheberden> Insanity5902 found it
[13:06:48] <rwaldron> nice
[13:07:00] <rwaldron> so, admittedly, i didnt run all of those
[13:07:02] <rwaldron> whoops.
[13:07:13] <timmywil> we're even ;)
[13:07:15] * rwaldron learns lessons the hard way sometimes
[13:07:21] <rwaldron> indeed
[13:07:56] <rwaldron> so, about that
[13:08:00] <rwaldron> the offset tests
[13:08:23] <rwaldron> there is a change coming, w/r to jQuery.support.fixedPosition move that i did
[13:09:08] <jqcommit> [jquery] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://bit.ly/oB0huL
[13:09:08] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Set back the offset test name to fix offset tests; iframe retrieval is based on test names - timmywil
[13:09:12] <rwaldron> the fixed position support stuff is now run early, using document.body (if it's ready) or jaubourg's fake body otherwise
[13:10:48] <timmywil> ah right, was that for 1.7?
[13:10:53] <timmywil> or 1.6.3
[13:10:56] <rwaldron> therefore, one test had to be modified to expect top:0, left:0 instead of 1,1
[13:11:08] <rwaldron> 1.7 doggy dawg
[13:11:15] <rwaldron> was just giving you a summary
[13:11:17] <timmywil> right right
[13:11:20] <rwaldron> in case you reviewed it
[13:11:23] <rwaldron> or whatevs
[13:11:27] <rwaldron> ok... now...
[13:11:33] <rwaldron> back to reviewing that dude's patch
[13:11:35] <rwaldron> hahahaha
[13:12:01] <Insanity5902> danheberden: what did you find?
[13:12:12] <danheberden> a domain in italy pounding the server
[13:12:16] <danheberden> or IP, rather
[13:12:18] <rwaldron> >:|
[13:12:22] <rwaldron> danheberden wtf.
[13:12:25] <Insanity5902> wonderful
[13:12:31] <rwaldron> jquery.it
[13:12:33] <danheberden> down from 1400 connections to 1000
[13:12:37] <danheberden> rwaldron same region/provider
[13:12:44] <rwaldron> ajpiano ^^
[13:13:16] <ajpiano> uhoh
[13:13:20] <ajpiano> what's the IP
[13:13:42] <danheberden> 151.66.71.247
[13:13:50] <danheberden> some reason, adding it as a dROP in iptables isn't working
[13:13:59] <danheberden> 79.44.180.72 too
[13:14:01] <danheberden> is hitting a bunch
[13:14:35] <danheberden> and 93.37.137.126
[13:15:00] <danheberden> all in italy
[13:15:15] <danheberden> Insanity5902 do i have to restart iptables for changes to come into effect do you know?
[13:15:30] <Insanity5902> you have to reload it i think
[13:16:49] <Insanity5902> danheberden: I raised teh serverlimit in apache again
[13:16:59] <Insanity5902> I'll try to log in every 30 min and check the beancounter
[13:17:46] <danheberden> down to 673 connections
[13:18:04] <danheberden> wtf iptables isn't blocking
[13:18:21] <danheberden> see if apache will deny
[13:18:29] <rwaldron> we need a low orbit ion cannon
[13:18:56] <Insanity5902> damnit, I read that then typed in loworbit for my next command
[13:19:07] <danheberden> Insanity5902 can you add those ips to deny in apache?
[13:19:44] <Insanity5902> iptables isn't configured for anything
[13:19:50] <danheberden> ha
[13:19:53] <Insanity5902>  /sbin/iptables -nxvL
[13:20:01] <Insanity5902> defualt accept :)
[13:20:50] <timmywil> rwaldron: getting fails in IE6
[13:21:00] <rwaldron> oh snap
[13:21:11] <danheberden> Do you mind getting is blocking those however way you see fit Insanity5902?
[13:21:44] <rwaldron> boy oh boy do i love cached results of any knd
[13:22:20] <Insanity5902> sure, i'll just do a generyal Apache Deny for right now
[13:22:33] <danheberden> sweet
[13:22:48] <eddiemonge> deny from all!
[13:23:01] <Insanity5902> Done!
[13:24:20] <danheberden> how are they still on the hmph, still shows their tcp connection
[13:24:31] <danheberden> but hopefully will be ok
[13:24:36] <danheberden> since it's not hitting apache
[13:24:39] <ajpiano> is this jquery.it striking back
[13:24:53] <danheberden> i wonder if they got new ips and are trying to rebuild a cache?
[13:25:14] <Insanity5902> that was in response to eddie, my bad
[13:25:15] <Insanity5902> lol
[13:25:23] <danheberden> oh, ha
[13:26:08] <eddiemonge> wasnt jquery.it the one we nuked before?
[13:26:29] <danheberden> yeah, sent them a special page that says "THIS AINT JQUERY FOO"
[13:26:33] <danheberden> or something like that
[13:27:00] <danheberden> their site still doesn't do anything
[13:27:07] <danheberden> so it's not reflecting any successful copies
[13:27:55] <Insanity5902> danheberden: should be there
[13:28:07] <danheberden> coo, now we're under 1000
[13:28:08] <Insanity5902> let me know, blocking all 3 ips on Directory /srv
[13:28:10] <rwaldron> timmywil pushed update
[13:28:20] <rwaldron> not sure if that's even right anymore
[13:28:23] <rwaldron> but take a look
[13:30:32] <Insanity5902> danheberden: load has dropped in third nearly
[13:30:53] <danheberden> just found another ip using 400 connections - added it to the list
[13:30:57] <Insanity5902> only 35 process
[13:31:04] <Insanity5902> compared to maxing out all 170 all togeher
[13:31:22] <danheberden> yeah, it'll be good to get iptables blocking but for now, that should keep load  down
[13:31:25] <danheberden> great work!
[13:33:15] <Insanity5902> not sure if we are using puppet or chef yet
[13:33:24] <Insanity5902> but having a quality set of iptables rules would be ncie
[13:37:40] <jqcommit> [jquery] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://bit.ly/p70tAo
[13:37:40] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Landing pull request 466. Test if opacity is not expected val. Fixes effects test suite. - rwldrn
[13:38:03] <timmywil> rwaldron: that does it
[13:38:18] <timmywil> thanks! sry for the hassle
[13:38:54] <rwaldron> hey man, no problem
[13:40:06] <rwaldron> i should've added a comment to that
[13:40:26] <rwaldron> that the only time an _empty_string_ will be matched is in IE
[13:40:39] <rwaldron> otherwise, the correct values will be tested as usual
[13:42:45] <timmywil> those tests are hard to understand on first read anyways.
[13:45:25] <gnarf> timmywil: sorry, got lost in a conversation with the UI team
[13:45:55] <gnarf> timmywil: you still here?
[13:46:10] <gnarf> I don't think raf has ever claimed to increase the performance of animations
[13:46:26] <gnarf> meerly to help limit the execution of the animation process to when the tab is in view
[13:47:15] <gnarf> I have an idea for a fix for #9381
[13:47:20] <gnarf> that might be really simple
[13:47:28] <gnarf> but it only fixes in chrome atm
[13:47:29] <gnarf> sadly
[13:47:31] <gnarf> :)
[13:47:38] <timmywil> gnarf: seems to me it does claim it tho. It should be able to manage its resources more efficiently during the animation because it gets to decide when to give the user a chance to execute and when to redraw rather than being limited to execution intervals set by the user.
[13:48:29] <gnarf> timmywil: Yes, but considering the speed of the draw operations / reflows we wont notice it on chrome
[13:48:32] <gnarf> etc
[13:49:05] <gnarf> the major benifit is the "mobile device" that is looking at a page with a jQuery slideshow
[13:49:19] <gnarf> and then switches windows
[13:49:30] <timmywil> i see, so you're saying the point about not seeing a noticeable performance improvement is not really an issue
[13:50:16] <timmywil> at least, not a point that can be used for an argument against raf inclusion
[13:50:44] <gnarf> conceded
[13:50:46] <rwaldron> timmywil ping me when you have a moment
[13:50:55] <gnarf> but argument adjusted
[13:51:18] <gnarf> I don't think we are including it because it was supposed to be performance increase
[13:51:51] <gnarf> or i don't think we should be including it for the "performance" increase
[13:52:53] <gnarf> okay
[13:52:57] <gnarf> giving up
[13:53:18] <gnarf> i think we can work around it
[13:53:26] <gnarf> i think our users should be able to work around it
[13:54:12] <timmywil> gnarf: you should know I'm doing my best to argue from this side. I can concede the point about performance.
[13:54:27] <gnarf> timmywil: nah, its a valid reason to argue against inclusion
[13:54:35] <gnarf> i give you that
[13:54:49] <timmywil> rwaldron: what's up
[13:55:08] <gnarf> I just think the counter point is equally valid
[13:55:42] <rwaldron> I'm worried about stuff
[13:55:54] <rwaldron> conflicting things
[13:56:17] <timmywil> concerning effects?
[13:56:23] <rwaldron> pull requests that are meant for 1.7 but directly conflict with others
[13:57:16] <rwaldron> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/406
[13:57:38] <rwaldron> that will conflict with the support.fixedPosition stuff
[13:58:23] <rwaldron> i think gnarf's data scanning patch has gone sour
[13:58:34] <gnarf> rwaldron: probably has
[13:58:37] <gnarf> close it
[13:58:39] <gnarf> or i can
[13:58:48] <gnarf> i will update it
[13:58:55] <gnarf> or did it get pulled?
[13:59:07] <rwaldron> still sitting
[13:59:26] <rwaldron> but I've done so much high & blocker status shit in data() in the last month
[13:59:38] <rwaldron> its definitely rotten
[14:00:24] <gnarf> i'll just restart the branch
[14:01:12] <rwaldron> since 1.6.3 is next week, we should land the 1.6.3 stuff soon
[14:02:05] <rwaldron> holy shit
[14:02:08] <rwaldron> as we speak...

[14:51:49] <rwaldron> nope
[14:51:55] <rwaldron> --rebase
[14:51:59] <rwaldron> and starting oer
[14:52:12] <timmywil> ok cool. sorry about that
[14:52:31] <timmywil> didn't want to take credit for dave's work
[14:52:49] <rwaldron> no problem
[14:53:10] <rwaldron> looks like github was smart enough to let me git push origin :10080, but maintained the pull request
[14:53:27] <timmywil> ah nice
[14:53:33] <rwaldron> so that even when i pushed -u 10080 it updated the pull request
[14:53:39] <rwaldron> only... now we look like weirdos
[14:53:47] <rwaldron> talking about shit that doesnt exist
[14:53:58] <timmywil> *delete*
[14:54:05] <rwaldron> anywya, just to explain why there is no unit test
[14:54:17] <rwaldron> apparently, we dont test "unload"
[14:54:26] <rwaldron> i'm guessing because its impossible to normalize
[14:54:33] <rwaldron> sooooo
[14:54:39] <rwaldron> the test i wrote is in the wnd
[14:54:47] <rwaldron> because it just doesnt work in older IE
[14:54:52] <rwaldron> anyway
[14:55:20] <rwaldron> the change is minimal and amounts to no more then good practice
[14:56:01] <timmywil> cool
