[06:25:49] <tbranyen> dot neeet
[06:26:34] <timmywil> lol
[07:58:57] <jaubourg> plop
[08:01:28] <gnarf> does that mean yr poopin?
[08:04:18] <jaubourg> haha, no
[08:04:21] <jaubourg> hi gnarf :)
[08:04:43] <gnarf> just kinda sounded like that sound
[08:42:33] <rwaldron> jaubourg hey dude
[08:45:42] <rwaldron> jaubourg is speaking with hanzo steel right now...
[08:55:32] <jaubourg> hey rick
[14:29:04] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg, rwaldron: i'm okay with the holdReady pull request staying closed, if it isn't clear :)
[14:29:04] <bot-t> (53 hours 20 mins ago) <gnarf> tell davemethvin RE http://jsfiddle.net/eJ4yd/3/ - did you maybe mean :first-child ???
[16:36:10] <jaubourg> re
[16:36:19] <DaveMethvin> hey jaubourg
[16:45:25] <jaubourg> this holdReady patch is getting better and better... so after all this argumentation about modularization, it all boils down to "but Zend Framework uses dom readyness as a synchro"
[16:45:48] <jaubourg> should I really comment saying: "file a bug against Zend Framework"?
[16:46:15] <rwaldron> wait...
[16:46:20] <rwaldron> my comment didnt say that?
[16:46:26] <rwaldron> jaubourg ^^
[16:46:30] <rwaldron> i thought I wrote that
[16:46:34] <rwaldron> i'm so effing tired
[16:46:39] <jaubourg> oh let me check
[16:46:46] <rwaldron> i was thonking it
[16:46:48] <rwaldron> thinking*
[16:47:34] <DaveMethvin> i don't think we can be responsible for people trying to misuse dom ready
[16:47:48] <jaubourg> well, it's not even a bug in Zend, really, what's so complicated about writing require( "jquery-ui.js", function() { $.load(...); } );?
[16:48:05] <DaveMethvin> if special work is needed to support script loaders then people shoudl do that work and not expect jquery to lie to them
[16:48:14] <rwaldron> the whole thing is completely unnecessary
[16:48:15] <jaubourg> +1
[16:48:36] <DaveMethvin> and jaubourg i agree on holdReady
[16:48:56] <jaubourg> heh, I don't even know why it made it in in the first place
[16:49:09] <DaveMethvin> it was put in before we discussed features and voted, i would have voted against it
[16:49:30] <DaveMethvin> holdready was just formalizing an even more horrible interface
[16:49:34] <DaveMethvin> that was already public
[16:49:45] <rwaldron> I saw it as a way to avoud jQuery ending up with its own $.require or whatever
[16:49:52] <jaubourg> oh yeah, I remember now
[16:49:53] <DaveMethvin> the "call the event handler with `false` instead of an event object" interface
[16:50:00] <rwaldron> James Burke is using for RequireJS
[16:50:06] <DaveMethvin> and yehuda used it too
[16:50:12] <rwaldron> i think thats sufficient dev-rel
[16:50:20] <jaubourg> ><
[16:50:26] <rwaldron> zend is a pile of shit
[16:50:39] <rwaldron> of course this person is an overly verbose lunatic
[16:50:45] <jaubourg> we have to stop being in the business of integrating features to please John and James
[16:50:47] <rwaldron> they write zend php all day
[16:50:59] <rwaldron> jaubourg it was one thng
[16:51:02] <jaubourg> John and James being taken randomly, mind you
[16:51:17] <jaubourg> rwaldron: $.sub?
[16:51:21] <DaveMethvin> ya
[16:51:24] <rwaldron> ugh
[16:51:26] <rwaldron> fuck
[16:51:30] <rwaldron> i hate that thing
[16:51:37] <rwaldron> i pretend it doesnt exist
[16:52:18] <DaveMethvin> i want to be open and consider everything
[16:52:25] <DaveMethvin> but we need to be careful about adding features/bloat
[16:52:31] <rwaldron> agreed
[16:53:07] <rwaldron> sort of off track, but I also deduct support points for anything that wasnt a ticket a first
[16:53:10] <DaveMethvin> like the problem with string objects being passed to $()
[16:53:14] <rwaldron> i missed that on the holdReady thing
[16:53:41] <DaveMethvin> starting with a pull request means the person feels screwed b/c they spent time on a patch we don't accept
[16:53:44] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin honestly, I only changed that to "wont fix" because you mentioned it
[16:53:48] <DaveMethvin> but it's not our fault
[16:53:59] <jaubourg> jQuery never supported String objects, did it? or does it on some places?
[16:54:02] <rwaldron> otherwise, as far as I'm concerned, its in the docs, its not a bug, its invalid
[16:54:43] <jaubourg> rwaldron: could be a feature request... I'm considering the "keep the original statusText" feature request
[16:55:03] <jaubourg> it makes sense as long as the normalized statusText is kept in the callbacks
[16:55:04] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin agreed, its _not_ our fault, but filing a ticket for discussion is def the way to
[16:55:05] <rwaldron> go*
[16:55:10] <DaveMethvin> just trying to be conciliatory with the reporter ... i figure he prolly spent an hour messing with it until he figured it out
[16:55:17] <rwaldron> ajpiano and i are doing a tandem talk at jquery conf boston
[16:55:19] <rwaldron> first ever
[16:55:23] <rwaldron> 2 man team
[16:55:25] <jaubourg> =)
[16:55:28] <ajpiano> woooo
[16:55:32] <jaubourg> eager to see this
[16:55:36] <jaubourg> oh, btw guys
[16:55:36] <ajpiano> THAT IS NOT PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE SIR
[16:55:38] <rwaldron> Contributing to jQuery with Style - tentative name

[16:56:08] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: you're comng?
[16:56:10] <rwaldron> *cough*whoops*cough*
[16:56:14] * rwaldron kicks self
[16:56:17] <DaveMethvin> thought you were going to jsconf.eu
[16:56:27] <rwaldron> jaubourg we have you covered
[16:56:32] <rwaldron> one way or another
[16:56:57] <jaubourg> Dave: proposal was rejected, sadly... though I had plans to present at jsonf.eu on Saturday, fly to Boston and present at jqcon on Sunday
[16:57:09] <jaubourg> so it'll make my life easier
[16:57:14] <ajpiano> you could actually come to the first day of jqcon now :p
[16:57:15] <jaubourg> rick: coolness :)
[16:57:21] <DaveMethvin> cool, we'll be glad to see you!
[16:57:23] <jaubourg> ajpiano: YES!!!
[16:58:22] <rwaldron> holy shit
[16:58:29] <rwaldron> clojurescript
[16:58:32] <rwaldron> :O
[16:58:41] <rwaldron> its like...
[16:58:58] <rwaldron> love
[16:59:04] <jaubourg> oh man, didn't tell you? Found a way to feature test if a link tag supports onload ;)
[16:59:30] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: how?
[16:59:36] <rwaldron> say what?
[16:59:45] <jaubourg> link.href = "data:text/css," :P
[16:59:50] <jaubourg> works even in IE6
[17:00:01] <DaveMethvin> harumph!
[17:00:33] <jaubourg> let me commit the new css transport
[17:00:35] <rwaldron> wow
[17:03:44] <jaubourg> https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/blob/master/src/ajax/css.js
[17:03:50] <jaubourg> needs comments but heh
[17:04:20] <jaubourg> I need to blog post about this, even use a deferred to handle the fact you have to wait for the feature test to be completed
[17:04:37] <DaveMethvin> btw jaubourg, i'm working with microsoft on a project and the xdr transport is greatly appreciated :)
[17:05:02] <DaveMethvin> just wish the stupid xdomainrequest activex object wasn't so dumb
[17:05:29] <DaveMethvin> bbl, gotta walk the dog ... in 95 degree weather
[17:05:39] <jaubourg> :)
[17:06:03] <rwaldron> thats very cool
[17:06:12] <rwaldron> one weird tab in there
[17:06:13] <rwaldron> var	cssHead
[17:06:21] <rwaldron> between var and cssHead
[17:07:12] <jaubourg> yeah, just saw that, I'll fix later
[17:07:31] <rwaldron> less then minor
[17:07:35] <rwaldron> this is way awesome
[17:07:45] <rwaldron> nice work as always
[17:08:00] <rwaldron> one last thing before i go
[17:08:01] <rwaldron> thank you
[17:08:11] <jaubourg> for?
[17:08:20] <rwaldron> i'm writing a mobile app for a client of ours
[17:08:31] <rwaldron> there is 1 $.ajax in the whole thing
[17:09:09] <rwaldron> your rewrite made it possible to write some seriously flexible ajax request code
[17:09:15] <jaubourg> :)
[17:09:22] <rwaldron> and then actually _do_stuff_ with the object
[17:09:45] <jaubourg> just happy people use it and enjoy it :)
[17:10:38] <rwaldron> i have to do some pretty wacky shit with this client too
[17:10:44] <rwaldron> CORS requests
[17:11:02] <rwaldron> they wrote a sexy node.js service API for their iOS app
[17:11:11] <rwaldron> then wanted a web app version
[17:11:15] <rwaldron> and came to us
[17:11:23] <rwaldron> its pretty fun
[17:11:28] <rwaldron> o, i have to go home
[17:11:30] <rwaldron> ok*
[17:11:31] <rwaldron> ack
[17:11:35] <jaubourg> that seems like an awesome project :)
[17:11:36] <rwaldron> good nigt for now
[17:11:42] <jaubourg> gn rick :)
[17:11:46] <rwaldron> i'll be back on probably ina bit
[17:11:48] <rwaldron> later dude
[22:57:55] <addyosmani> hey kswedberg
[23:05:01] <addyosmani> ?9877 if anyone else is around
[23:05:18] <addyosmani> I don't mind fixing, but the issue is we've still got 1.4 on the docs subdomain for some reason.
[23:07:09] <ajpiano> hm, that is dicey
[23:07:23] <ajpiano> we could scratch the demo
[23:07:24] <ajpiano> :p
[23:07:33] <addyosmani> that is always an option :P
[23:07:44] <ajpiano> it probably is the one that is the shortest path
[23:07:52] <ajpiano> as opposed to ugprading jquery on docs.
[23:07:53] <ajpiano> *
[23:08:09] <addyosmani> yeah. you're probably right.
[23:08:30] <ajpiano> you could make a fiddle to link to
[23:08:30] <ajpiano> !
[23:09:10] <addyosmani> would be nice if we had a stop-gap like having our own jq14 and jq162 instances to use for the demos, but might not look that tidy.
[23:09:12] <addyosmani> indeed!
[23:09:18] <addyosmani> fiddles can be fiddled.
[23:10:01] <ajpiano> yeah, i think fiddles are a better approach, having live code examples in a FAQ is weird
[23:10:23] <ajpiano> and something that's pretty much only possible for javascript anyway :p
[23:10:32] <addyosmani> agreed. long as there are no issues with embedding, we should go for that option.
[23:10:47] <ajpiano> can always link
[23:10:50] <ajpiano> just*
[23:11:31] <addyosmani> I'll double check with Karl just to make sure he didn't have other plans for how to handle this later.
[23:11:44] <addyosmani> long as he's down, I'll work on putting together the fiddles for dis stuffs.
[23:12:02] <ajpiano> addyosmani: fwiw, the FAQ content from the mediawiki
[23:12:06] <ajpiano> is destined for the learning site anyway
[23:12:15] <addyosmani> ah.
[23:12:24] <ajpiano> so it's up to us, but get karl's input anyway lol
[23:12:29] <addyosmani> lol
[23:12:49] <addyosmani> If thats the case, might as well improve on this while its being edited ; )
[23:13:25] <ajpiano> heh yeah
[23:14:00] <ajpiano> i started moving in some of the contents from docs a few weeks ago
[23:14:06] <ajpiano> if you're feeling enterprsiing you can go for it
[23:14:08] <ajpiano> :p
[23:14:10] <addyosmani> lol
[23:14:21] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/web-learn-jquery-com/commit/907fda34 etc
[23:14:23] <addyosmani> I may just. Really want to find a solid few hours to put into the learning site
[23:14:24] <socialhapy> http://bit.ly/nJMbX4 ajpiano (2 weeks ago) on web-learn-jquery-com: [docs.jquery.com] How jQuery Works tutorial with very minor revisions
[23:14:30] <ajpiano> yeah
[23:14:33] <addyosmani> oh nice!
[23:14:39] <ajpiano> well if you do, what's it called .. uh
[23:14:55] <ajpiano> copy and paste from the mediawiki edit page
[23:15:02] <ajpiano> cause it's not that hard to go from that to markdown
[23:15:14] <addyosmani> oh yeah.
[23:15:17] <addyosmani> good point
[23:15:40] <addyosmani> do you know if we had a chance to look into the search side of things further?
[23:15:52] <ajpiano> dan and richard and i were talking about it a bunch today
[23:16:00] <addyosmani> markdown -> static site is the bees knees, but was curious
[23:16:02] <addyosmani> awesome
[23:16:46] <ajpiano> i'm planning to give a shot with trying our content with jekyll and http://pwiddershoven.nl/blog/2011/05/11/jekyll-indextank-static-website-fulltext-search.html
[23:17:10] <addyosmani> duude.
[23:17:12] <addyosmani> thats sexy.
[23:17:39] <ajpiano> richard is trying this thing of like, populating wordpress via git
[23:17:45] <ajpiano> and getting search, caching, etc, that way
[23:18:12] <addyosmani> If he's doing that on a repo somewhere, wouldn't mind pitching in.
[23:18:28] <addyosmani> Ton of people interested in that kind of setup
[23:18:35] <ajpiano> i think he's planning to get started at some point soonish
[23:18:35] <ajpiano> yeah
[23:18:47] <ajpiano> ping him tomorrow
[23:18:51] <addyosmani> kewwl. will do
