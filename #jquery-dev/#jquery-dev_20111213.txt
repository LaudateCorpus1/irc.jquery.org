[04:30:02] <danheberden> ?tell mikesherov - i added you to the list in trac; might need to erase your cache since the js file is associated with the process
[04:30:02] <bot-t> danheberden, Okay.
[04:30:43] <danheberden> ?tell mikesherov - when i said i added you, i meant i added you to the elusive file JohnResig was talking about
[04:30:43] <bot-t> danheberden, Okay.
[05:03:51] <mikesherov> .
[05:03:51] <bot-t> (33 mins 40 secs ago) <danheberden> tell mikesherov - i added you to the list in trac; might need to erase your cache since the js file is associated with the process
[05:03:52] <bot-t> (33 mins 8 secs ago) <danheberden> tell mikesherov - when i said i added you, i meant i added you to the elusive file JohnResig was talking about
[05:04:04] <mikesherov> hooray

[05:07:52] <mikesherov> .
[05:08:31] <mikesherov> bot-t: tell rwaldron ?slaps rwaldron
[05:08:31] <bot-t> mikesherov, Okay.
[05:09:25] <mikesherov> danheberden: thanks. Works like a charm. Might want to figure out how to make that script work with a trac permission
[05:12:28] <JohnResig> mikesherov: unfortunately there doesn't appear to be a clean API for that
[05:13:13] <mikesherov> JohnResig: yeah, I've worked with Trac plugins before. It's definitely a bit ornery.
[05:13:42] <mikesherov> And I guess new team members don't come aboard often enought to warrant the effort
[05:14:58] <mikesherov> JohnResig: http://xkcd.com/974/
[05:17:06] <JohnResig> heh
[05:17:21] <JohnResig> yeah, I tried to do something when I set it up - gave up and just wrote the list of users
[05:17:25] <JohnResig> far easier
[05:19:22] <mikesherov> yup
[05:59:42] <danheberden> So DaveMethvin, getting pretty excited for nextAt/prevAt
[06:00:19] <DaveMethvin> it shouldn't be hard to create nextUnless, nextBefore, nextAround
[06:25:07] <danheberden> DaveMethvin or nextUntilOhWaitNotThatOneYeahTheOtherOneRightJustOneMoreOverYeahThatsIt
[06:26:06] <DaveMethvin> danheberden: maybe we should rename .end() to .wasItGoodForYou()
[06:26:35] <danheberden> hahahaha
[06:28:05] <timmywil> lol
[07:06:05] <rwaldron> danheberden  "bug-tracket"
[07:06:05] <bot-t> (1 hour 57 mins ago) <mikesherov> tell rwaldron ?slaps rwaldron
[07:09:45] <rwaldron> ahahahaha
[07:09:57] <rwaldron> ?tell mikesherov nice one.
[07:09:57] <bot-t> rwaldron, Okay.
[07:19:56] <danheberden> rwaldron haha, did i say that?
[07:24:26] <rwaldron> danheberden: this is duplicating my PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/638
[07:24:27] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by tojocky (6h, 41m ago): fix: The "sys" module is now called "util". It should have a similar
[07:25:08] <danheberden> yeah, but did you see that he corrected his preview pull request 635?!
[07:25:39] <danheberden> more like require( 'theSamePullRequestAgain' )
[07:25:46] <rwaldron> ahahahaha
[08:52:19] <jzaefferer> hey rwaldron, this one is for you: http://i.imgur.com/XmNps.jpg
[09:00:22] <jzaefferer> great timing for this one: https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/pull/96
[09:00:23] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on testswarm by hashar (20m, 47s ago): indentation / whitespaces cleanup
[09:00:36] <hashar> that one is from me
[09:00:39] <hashar> lame cleanup
[09:12:30] <DaveMethvin> Dirty Whitespace sounds like the name of a band rwaldron should be in
[09:13:01] <DaveMethvin> i have a feeling this is one of those weeks when i will regret getting an email about every trac update :)
