[07:49:35] <jqcommit> [testswarm/master] Move addjob perl scripts from ./scripts/*.pl.txt to ./scripts/addjob/*.pl - Timo Tijhof
[08:04:19] <jqcommit> [testswarm] Krinkle pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/3FlGeA
[08:04:19] <jqcommit> [testswarm/master] Add README for addjob scripts - Timo Tijhof
[08:10:36] <idbentley> dev.jquery.com is down - is this the url of the active bugtracker?
[08:11:14] <snover> not unless you are in a time warp back to 2008 :)
[08:11:39] <idbentley> Still linked from main jquery.com page
[08:15:05] <Krinkle> .
[08:15:22] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Do you know Perl good enough to fix an addjob script?
[08:29:43] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: Maybe
[08:29:57] <jzaefferer> These scripts are the only Perl code I ever touched
[08:30:06] <jzaefferer> I at least know my way around them
[08:30:22] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: http://pastie.org/3727558
[08:30:29] <Krinkle> that's my progress so far on jquery.pl
[08:30:42] <Krinkle> I'm stuck though, my knowledge of Perl is too limited
[08:30:49] <Krinkle> I haven't tested it, but it's half way there
[08:30:57] <Krinkle> see also the new README.md in the addjob dir
[08:31:12] <jzaefferer> looks like you agree with #143 - should we land that as part of 0.3.0?
[08:31:14] <Krinkle> Can you finish/commit it?
[08:33:26] <jzaefferer> I'll check it out
[08:38:28] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: Are you actually using that for anything?
[08:38:43] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: What do you mean?
[08:38:56] <Krinkle> I assume jQuery is using it?
[08:38:58] <jzaefferer> swarm.jquery.org is using Jenkins to submit jobs, not these scripts
[08:39:07] <Krinkle> right
[08:39:14] <jzaefferer> I was using the ui script to test locally, but that's about it
[08:39:22] <Krinkle> well at Wikimedia we use a php script right now, and will use Jenkins in the future as well
[08:39:37] <Krinkle> I've never executed any of these perl scripts
[08:39:38] <jzaefferer> yeah, appendTo also built some custom php solution
[08:39:56] <jzaefferer> maybe we can just delete this crap and provide one of the php things as a reference for others
[08:39:57] <Krinkle> I suppose we could create 1 working example and ditch the rest
[08:41:40] <jzaefferer> I could update the UI script, at least I had that working, unlike the others
[08:47:16] <jzaefferer> got that working, by changing almost nothing ;)
[08:51:40] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: Should I just commit the ui script and delete the others?
[08:52:01] <jzaefferer> the readme is still useful
[09:10:01] <jqcommit> [testswarm] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/MqehKQ
[09:10:01] <jqcommit> [testswarm/master] Update UI script to use api.php; delete the others: We don't use them, they don't work, and haven't been working in a long time - Jörn Zaefferer
[09:10:03] <jzaefferer> "I suppose we could create 1 working example and ditch the rest" <- so yes
[09:10:05] <jzaefferer> pushed
[09:15:49] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: browserSets is an array
[09:16:26] <Krinkle> It happens to work as browserSets= because of WebRequest::getArray will create an array with 1 item if it's not an array
[09:21:31] <jqcommit> [testswarm] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/Z0lWqA
[09:21:31] <jqcommit> [testswarm/master] browserSets is an array argument. Also works with just one arg, but still - Jörn Zaefferer
[09:22:59] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: fixed
[09:23:04] <Krinkle> k
[09:30:37] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: Breaking the useragents out of the DB now seems to make sense, while we're breaking things anyway. Does that fit into your schedule?
[09:31:07] <Krinkle> You mean if I have time to implement it?
[09:36:15] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I'm not sure what you're asking.. Anything that helps testswarm easier to maintain and upgrade, the sooner the better :)
[09:36:43] <jzaefferer> Yes, time to implement
[09:37:44] <Krinkle> Well, this week I won't be able to work on it. I've got other wikimedia things to do now. To put it boldy: We got what we needed in testswarm (API mostly, and some other nice features I thought I'd plug in while at it)
[09:37:55] <Krinkle> But I won't abandon the project though, don't worry :)
[09:38:17] <Krinkle> I might take a stab at it next weekend
[09:38:26] <jzaefferer> Okay, that works for me
[09:42:31] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: re: grunt on color, I think I kinda want to figure it out, but some help wouldn't be too hard - I just wanna check out the grunt process for myself
[09:44:48] <jzaefferer> gnarf: I can assist if you want, though for color it should be trivial, compared to UI
[09:44:57] <jzaefferer> the QUnit grunt.js file might be a good reference
[10:08:09] <jqcommit> [qunit] jzaefferer pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/wDb8vQ
[10:08:09] <jqcommit> [qunit/master] Release 1.5.0 - Jörn Zaefferer
[10:08:09] <jqcommit> [qunit/master] Bump post-release version - Jörn Zaefferer
[10:08:49] <jzaefferer> Look, just released QUnit 1.5.0 :-)
[10:13:27] <clarkbox> jzaefferer any chance the testswarm client id's changed?
[10:14:54] <clarkbox> i know some were added... but did any IDs change?
[10:15:38] <jzaefferer> clarkbox: I'm not sure - I've reset the useragents though
[10:16:52] <Krinkle> clarkbox: client Ids or useragent ids?
[10:17:08] <Krinkle> clarkbox: user agent ids change all the time because we add the inserts in the middle of the sql file in alphabetical order
[10:17:14] <clarkbox> the DB id field
[10:17:22] <clarkbox> its an increment auto-gen
[10:17:30] <Krinkle> if you clear out user agents and repopulate,  it will break
[10:17:37] <clarkbox> ahhhhh
[10:17:41] <clarkbox> thats it
[10:17:42] <Krinkle> break existing stuff at least
[10:17:45] <clarkbox> thats the problem
[10:17:51] <clarkbox> k. ill remap them
[10:18:18] <clarkbox> in the future, we need to add them in sequence
[10:18:33] <Krinkle> no, in the future we won't use numerical ids from a database at all
[10:18:35] <jq-jenkins> Project QUnit build #100: STILL FAILING in 10 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/QUnit/100/

[10:18:44] <Krinkle> and not in a database
[10:18:45] <clarkbox> ya, future ver
[10:18:48] <clarkbox> but in meantime
[10:18:50] <Krinkle> very soon though
[10:18:54] <clarkbox> great
[10:18:55] <Krinkle> before the next release
[10:19:03] <Krinkle> in the next release*
[10:19:51] <clarkbox> scott_gonzalez ^
[11:08:56] <clarkbox> ok running browserstack again
[11:46:55] <scott_gonzalez> clarkbox: So that was our problem? Bad mapping of browser ids?
[11:47:03] <clarkbox> yes
[11:47:10] <scott_gonzalez> awesome :-/
[11:47:11] <clarkbox> some were added while i was away
[11:47:17] <clarkbox> i should have clued in sooner...
[11:47:44] <clarkbox> after krinkle is done with next version, we wont have to maintain the map
[11:48:13] <clarkbox> as of now things are running smoothly. there is only one browser needed and running
[11:48:54] <clarkbox> you can log into the splunk ui and monitor things. let me know if you need URL/credentials again
[11:50:22] <scott_gonzalez> holy crap, 20 email threads while I was at lunch :-/
[11:54:30] <Krinkle> clarkbox: jzaefferer The scripts used by jQuery's jenkins install to interact with browerstack and testswarm are those currently in a public repo and up to date (in both directions)?
[11:54:42] <Krinkle> It seems there is a bug where it is considered a build to be a failure too soon
[11:54:59] <Krinkle> it doesn't wait until all run_useragents are no longer on status "notstarted"
[11:54:59] <Krinkle> "
[11:55:10] <Krinkle> reports "failure" way too soon
[11:55:38] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/QUnit/100/console
[11:55:40] <Krinkle> for instnace
[11:56:14] <Krinkle> directly after submitting to testswarm it checks the job page (were almost all runs are at "nostarted"), and then closes up and reports the build as a failure
[11:59:19] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: Only parts of it. The scripts for pulling in the files and serving each revision are only on the swarm server :/
[11:59:28] <Krinkle> yeah, that's fine
[11:59:43] <jzaefferer> not really :p
[11:59:58] <jzaefferer> But yeah, those are very jQuery specific
[12:00:02] <Krinkle> nod
[12:00:06] <jzaefferer> the browserstack stuff is mostly in Clark's repo
[12:00:23] <jzaefferer> except for the infrastructure wiki page
[12:00:31] <jzaefferer> which should probably move to that repo as well
[12:00:40] <jzaefferer> clarkbox: could you do that?
[12:00:41] <clarkbox> i need to update that repo
[12:00:56] <Krinkle> I mean the part of the Jenkins hook that is (or rather should) be polling TestSwarm until all runs are no longer at "notstarted" (e.g. error, pass, fail or time-out)
[12:00:59] <clarkbox> its a month old.
[12:01:13] <clarkbox> you mean the cron job?
[12:01:13] <Krinkle> since it is (or at least was until recently) broken in that way
[12:01:19] <clarkbox> ohhh
[12:01:22] <clarkbox> that does not exist
[12:01:31] <clarkbox> as far as i know
[12:01:32] <jzaefferer> Jenkins/TestSwarm is here: https://github.com/appendto/jenkins-testswarm
[12:01:36] <Krinkle> it reports to IRC that the build is failed within minutes after the commit, even though testswarm has barely started testing
[12:01:44] <jzaefferer> and yeah, that's broken and incomplete in various ways
[12:02:19] <jzaefferer> if you want to dig into that, this should help: http://jquerytesting.pbworks.com/w/page/47944122/Hot%20Deploy%20Jenkins-Testswarm%20Plugin
[12:02:44] <Krinkle> I've looked at that repo a few times but I can't find the logic that does this at all. It's so incredibly chunked into pieces (blame Java for that) that I can't find a thing
[12:02:57] <jzaefferer> Once we're done with the TestSwarm rewrite, I want to look into that again, though I also hope for Justin_o to make progress there
[12:03:00] <Krinkle> most of it seem to be boilerplate stuff that doesn't matter
[12:03:12] <jzaefferer> yeah, its rather silly :/
[12:03:29] <jzaefferer> this is where the relevant stuff is: https://github.com/appendto/jenkins-testswarm/tree/master/src/main/java/com/appendto/hudson/testswarm
[12:03:47] <jzaefferer> this is probably what you were looking for: https://github.com/appendto/jenkins-testswarm/blob/master/src/main/java/com/appendto/hudson/testswarm/TestSwarmDecisionMaker.java#L72
[12:04:24] <Krinkle> ok
[12:06:53] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I suppose we could add a property in JobAction that will indicate for the job as a whole "progress" or "finished", so that Jenkins only has to go into the structure if it is complete, in which case it goes through and if all are passed, then it marks the build as passed and if one or more didn't pass mark the build as failed
[12:07:27] <Krinkle> and of course it should be repeating the check if it is "progress" until it is "complete"
[12:08:10] <jzaefferer> Parsing a proper JSON response should make that whole thing a lot easier
[12:08:17] <Krinkle> Depending on how Jenkins works it may have to be done synchronous (e.g. sleep(30) and try again), I don't know if jenkins allows the build process to return and later populate the status
[12:08:50] <jzaefferer> Jenkins is already polling
[12:09:01] <Krinkle> ideally it would submit to TestSwarm, return "build in progress" and periodically check back and eventually set it to "failed" or "passed"
[12:09:08] <jzaefferer> But it runs builds as workers, so that's not a big deal anyway
[12:09:26] <Krinkle> okay, so synchronous sleeps aren't an issue
[12:09:28] <jzaefferer> That's what it is doingalready
[12:09:37] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: it is polling testswarm job/x ?
[12:09:44] <jzaefferer> Just the result checking is crap
[12:10:09] <Krinkle> Project QUnit build #100: STILL FAILING in 10 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/QUnit/100/
[12:10:13] <Krinkle> so that is a false positive?
[12:10:21] <Krinkle> not because it stopped checking but because it checking incorrectly
[12:11:00] <Krinkle> because at http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/QUnit/100/console it appear to be checking only once and then mark the build as failed or passed and be done with it
[12:11:09] <jzaefferer> Yeah, that's probably the one is looks at, see is the "parsing": https://github.com/appendto/jenkins-testswarm/blob/master/src/main/java/com/appendto/hudson/testswarm/TestSwarmUtil.java
[12:15:45] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: btw, did you get a chance to look at jquery/testswarm:twitterbootstrapskin yet?
[12:16:56] <jzaefferer> nope, not yet
[12:17:02] <Krinkle> k
[12:18:13] <jzaefferer> well, looks good
[12:18:36] <jzaefferer> colours on the user and job page could be less subtle
[12:22:11] <johnbender> jzaefferer: we're seeing a bunch of java issues since yesterday at about 9am, has anything changed?
[12:22:37] <johnbender> it switches between the classic out of memory and "cannot create Java Virtual machine"
[12:22:42] <johnbender> both of which I assume are memory issues
[13:12:38] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I agree, I want those more obvious like they were

[20:41:44] <jq-jenkins> dave.methvin: Followup to #11469; add test case and clarify code.
[20:42:08] <snover> DaveMethvin: where are you at now? consulting still?
[20:42:26] <DaveMethvin> yep
[20:42:34] <DaveMethvin> doing pretty well
[20:42:42] <DaveMethvin> also doing some jQuery training
[20:42:52] <snover> woo!
[20:43:06] <snover> do you have IE contacts at MS now?
[20:43:39] <DaveMethvin> yep
[20:45:35] <snover> MS is the last great frontier for me
[20:45:57] <snover> I think I know people working for all the other vendors…
[20:45:58] <DaveMethvin> i can def hook you up if you need someone, i am doing some work for ms
[20:46:16] <DaveMethvin> they were just talking to a site using dojo that was on 1.5
[20:46:27] <DaveMethvin> i was tryna get them to upgrade to 1.5.2 at least
[20:46:30] <snover> yeah
[20:46:39] <snover> 1.5.2 is the 1.5 release with ie9 support
[20:46:47] <DaveMethvin> b/c they were forcing ie9/10 into ie8 mode as a workaround
[20:46:52] <snover> :'(
[20:46:55] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[20:47:06] <DaveMethvin> like, why issue a maint release if nobody uses it?
[20:47:24] <snover> oh, many people do
[20:47:31] <snover> just maybe not…those ones
[20:47:45] <snover> lots of corporate installations with lots of policies and procedures
[20:47:58] <DaveMethvin> well actually i think they were on some non-official version, the version was "0.0.0" i guess that means it's a custom build?
[20:48:10] <DaveMethvin> but it was circa 1.5
[20:48:21] <snover> a custom build where they forgot to set the version in their build profile, yes
[20:48:44] <DaveMethvin> i tried faking it out and pushing 1.5.2 in instead but that didn't work
[20:48:51] <DaveMethvin> so i think they had other patches or code in the file
[20:48:56] <snover> ugh. those are the worst.
[20:48:58] <DaveMethvin> at that point i gave up
[20:49:05] <snover> it’s so easy to not do it that way
[20:49:08] <snover> and yet
[20:49:15] <snover> people meddle with the source
[20:49:26] <DaveMethvin> it's OPEN source
[20:49:30] <snover> fwiw there isn’t really an “official” version, everyone that uses it seriously is expected to do a custom build
[20:49:37] <snover> i dunno why non-sdks are even provided
[20:51:18] <snover> oh well. it’s very nice for writing web apps :)
[20:51:50] <DaveMethvin> snover: do you know if dojo can be used for a Windows 8 Metro app?
[20:53:33] <snover> probably, I vaguely recall someone doing some work to support the MS touch events
[20:53:41] <snover> there’s a touch abstraction layer for dealing with that stuff
[20:54:10] <DaveMethvin> yeah, scott_gonzalez has been working on something similar for UI to handle the MSPointer events
[20:56:55] <snover> tell him to stop and just start contributing to dijit :)
[20:57:29] <snover> duplicate efforts are so 2000s
[20:59:12] <DaveMethvin> ugh, my ie7 unit tests seems hung, i think that's it for tonight
[20:59:25] <snover> poor ie
[20:59:30] <snover> it just wants to die
[20:59:33] <snover> ie7*
[20:59:47] <DaveMethvin> yeah i just can't tell sometimes
[20:59:51] <DaveMethvin> its sooooo flakey
[21:00:34] <DaveMethvin> awright, see you guys another day
