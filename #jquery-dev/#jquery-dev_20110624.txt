[15:04:35] <gnarf> is there any reason for this page to still exist: http://docs.jquery.com/AjaxQueue
[21:22:41] <gavin_huang> having a question on attr()'s implementation. when checking a boolean attr's existence, why does jquery checks the corresponding prop instead? does it mean jquery expect browser to auto set prop when a boolean attr is set?
[21:44:01] <iraebrasil> I don't remember very well, but one of the episodes of the jQuery podcast discuss this extensively. They were having problems from the miss interpretation on the difference between properties and attributes. They deprecated some .attr() scenarios that used to work in past versions.
[21:57:57] <gavin_huang> iraebrasil, are you suggesting that jquey deprecated using attr() to check boolean attr's existence? what would be the new way to do that?
[21:59:36] <iraebrasil> no no... i didn't mean that... i meant they are trying to fix it in the long run... there are some posts about what they changed... I am not familiar with the code itself... I was just pointing out that there are intentional changes going on
[22:05:17] <gavin_huang> iraebrasil, oh, cool, thanks for the info.
[22:06:48] <paul_irish> hey iraebrasil :)
