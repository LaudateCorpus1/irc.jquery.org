[04:57:41] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman gnarf: GitHub tells you how to work with PRs. Click the information icon on the bar that says "This pull request can be automatically merged."
[04:57:49] <scott_gonzalez> Though that's not what I do.
[04:58:19] <scott_gonzalez> I copy the URL and branch name from step 2 and do a git fetch on that.
[04:58:57] <scott_gonzalez> Most of the PRs we get are one or two commits, so I just cherry-pick them, making edits and squashing.
[04:59:15] <ben_alman> good morning
[04:59:24] <ben_alman> yeah the built-in gh way blows
[04:59:47] <ben_alman> i'm writing a bash alias for now
[04:59:51] <ben_alman> er function
[05:00:00] <scott_gonzalez> I also always run git log on the commit to make sure the author has correct contact info.
[05:00:13] <ben_alman> commit or commits
[05:00:44] <ben_alman> you're looking at like: git log -n1 --format="%an <%ae>" ?
[05:02:45] <scott_gonzalez> git log SHA
[05:03:05] <scott_gonzalez> But that longer command will work to give you just the info you care about.
[05:03:59] <ben_alman> where are you getting the SHA from?
[05:04:05] <ben_alman> i know each PR commit has a sha
[05:04:10] <gibson042> .
[05:04:42] <scott_gonzalez> From the PR page.
[05:04:47] <ben_alman> heh manually
[05:09:55] <ben_alman> this is what gnarf says he does
[05:10:00] <ben_alman> <gnarf> git co remote/repo ; git checkout -b pr-123 ; git pull --rebase upstream master
[05:10:07] <ben_alman> wtf is git checkout remote/repo
[05:10:10] <ben_alman> i don't understand that
[05:10:33] <ben_alman> i've done git remote add somename path_to_remote
[05:10:50] <ben_alman> no idea what git checkout remote/repo means
[05:36:55] <ben_alman> ok i'm gonna commute
[05:37:01] <ben_alman> but when i get to work i need answers!
[05:37:12] <ben_alman> i need to finally understand this process
[05:37:20] <ben_alman> and it seems like there are little pieces missing everywhere

[06:57:14] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: no idea from the description ... do datepickers do things like use .wrap that might serialize the object tag to html?
[06:58:04] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think so. I'm guessing it's calling .data() on the clicked element (the swf object)
[06:58:41] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't looked into it yet, figured I'd see if there were any known issues with <object> first.
[06:59:03] <DaveMethvin> it should be okay to call .data() on a swf
[06:59:07] <DaveMethvin> we have that excepted
[06:59:12] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[06:59:18] <DaveMethvin> all other objects can't hold data in ie

[10:53:46] <ryanneufeld> I don't evny you man
[10:54:15] <ryanneufeld> you guys know if document.referrer is reliable?
[10:54:37] <snover> wat
[10:55:33] <ryanneufeld> snover: one of my colleagues wants to use it in production code. I forced him to do a udefined check, but I can't find any solid docs that tell me if it's reliable or not
[10:55:45] <ryanneufeld> it's on MDN, and *shudder* w3schools
[10:56:18] <ryanneufeld> the later of which I don't trust, and the former typically is referring to FF, and not the other browsers
[10:56:56] <snover> refer[r\er is never reliable
[10:57:00] <snover> refer[r]er is never reliable
[10:57:34] <ryanneufeld> okay, how can I prove that, or back up that claim to my co-workers?
[10:57:53] <ryanneufeld> I don't trust it myself

[11:38:29] <ryanneufeld> Thanks
[11:54:22] <ben_alman> gnarf, scott_gonzalez, DaveMethvin i just created and used this; it seems like it might do the majority of pull requesty kinda stuff over 4 main steps, feel free to check it out https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/gpr
[11:55:30] <DaveMethvin> ben_alman: i'll take  a look, at the very least it will act as documentation and i'm sure i'll learn something
[11:55:48] <ben_alman> it might be close to what your process is
[11:56:02] <ben_alman> but lmk if you have feedback
[11:57:34] <scott_gonzalez> I don't actually have any issues with what I do.
[11:58:00] <ben_alman> oh i'm sure
[11:58:07] <ben_alman> but i'm going to try this for me
[11:58:12] <ben_alman> btw i have all the author name stuff automated
[11:58:29] <ben_alman> i create a temporary tag pointing to the author PR's HEAD
[11:58:36] <ben_alman> but anyways
[11:58:41] <ben_alman> i'm not suggesting that you guys use this
[11:58:50] <ben_alman> but if i'm doing anything retarded, please let me know
[11:58:55] <ben_alman> so that i can learn
[11:59:16] <tbranyen> php :| when the rest of your app is node
[11:59:18] <tbranyen> gah
[11:59:35] <ben_alman> tbranyen: gimme a more concise way to parse json
[11:59:41] <scott_gonzalez> tbranyen: and perl :-P
[11:59:45] <ben_alman> i could use node and JSON.parse
[12:01:21] <tbranyen> yeah, i'm still going through your source, that just jumped out at me heh
[12:01:42] <ben_alman> i could do like this
[12:01:42] <ben_alman> foo='{"a":{"b":123}}'; node -e "console.log(JSON.parse('$foo').a.b)"
[12:01:53] <ben_alman> dunno if there's something better than console.log
[12:01:56] <ben_alman> it's kinda verbose
[12:01:57] <tbranyen> do you need to console.log isn't that automatic?
[12:02:01] <ben_alman> hmmn
[12:02:10] <ben_alman> not automatic
[12:02:21] <tbranyen> yeah must be a repl feature
[12:02:25] <tbranyen> oh well
[12:03:12] <ben_alman> but yeah i can totally switch it to node
[12:03:17] <ben_alman> since i already use that
[12:03:24] <ben_alman> it's just that every machine has php built in
[12:03:37] <ben_alman> so i tend to fall back on the least # of dependencies
[12:25:20] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez rworth: http://stage.qunitjs.com/intro/
[12:25:57] <DaveMethvin> lol timmywil: "hey clarkeyboy, it's not a not problem" just struck me as funny
[12:26:13] <timmywil> lol
[12:30:15] <ben_alman> tbranyen: here's the node solution https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/gpr#L18-26
[12:30:34] <ben_alman> i was having a problem using JSON.parse("â¦").foo.bar
[12:30:44] <ben_alman> until i realized i could just do (...).foo.bar
[12:30:45] <ben_alman> heh
[12:30:47] <tbranyen> ben_alman: lol awesome
[12:30:51] <ben_alman> derp
[12:31:13] <tbranyen> oh and great with -pe
[12:31:17] <ben_alman> totally
[12:31:41] <rworth> jzaefferer looking good. Though it looks like that < is tripping up pygmentize?
[12:31:48] <ben_alman> for JSON, node is great
[12:31:52] <ben_alman> other stuff, not so great
[13:30:26] <jzaefferer> rworth: yeah, any idea how to address that? Also any idea how we could improve the menu-header?
[13:30:32] <jzaefferer> One or two more and we're running out of space
[14:23:06] <scott_gonzalez> WHAT DID YOU DO?
[14:23:24] <scott_gonzalez> We have ~200 unit test failures against jquery-git :-/
[14:23:44] <scott_gonzalez> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/185
[14:26:48] <gnarf> timmywil: looks like sizzle issues mostly ^^^
[14:26:59] <gnarf> but there was an effects one :/
[14:28:07] <DaveMethvin> i did a run with most of the browsers locally right before beta1
[14:28:26] <DaveMethvin> but of course timmywil rewrote all the things since then
[14:34:39] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: do you have a login for jenkins?
[14:34:54] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: you can kick off our release coverage build which does units against all releases of jQuery
[14:35:18] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: its how we just caught those fails ^^^^
[14:35:50] <DaveMethvin> i don't think i have a login for jenkins gnarf
[14:36:28] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/user/dave.methvin/
[14:36:55] <gnarf> thats prolly just from github tho
[14:37:08] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/user/dmethvin/
[14:37:10] <gnarf> that one too
[14:38:03] <gnarf> im not sure how to enable logins here or edit users, or even if i can
[14:38:09] <DaveMethvin> okay, i DO have a login :D
[14:38:14] <DaveMethvin> dmethvin
[14:38:18] <gnarf> okay :)
[14:38:20] <DaveMethvin> now... what do i do?
[14:38:44] <gnarf> on the "/" page
[14:38:49] <gnarf> you have a list of jobs
[14:39:07] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20Release%20Coverage/ <--- that one runs against all jQueries
[14:39:23] <gnarf> hit build now when you want to test it
[14:39:38] <gnarf> if you don't have a build now button - ask jzaefferer or krinkle maybe?
[14:39:44] <gnarf> i can't seem to edit users here
[14:39:49] <DaveMethvin> okay, i have a build now
[14:39:55] <DaveMethvin> so we just need to get timmywil to fix stuff?
[14:40:41] <gnarf> looks like i might have one to look at too
[14:41:20] <DaveMethvin> there was like one or two fails in beta1, i got one of them but yeah the other may have been in effects
[14:41:44] <DaveMethvin> ugh, i am all stinky now, just got the mail and there was some sample of perfume called Justin Bieber's Girlfriend
[14:41:53] <DaveMethvin> WHY DID I OPEN THAT??????!!!
[14:42:22] <DaveMethvin> my eyes are watering
[14:50:02] <timmywil> im looking, looks like a POS issue
[14:50:13] <timmywil> I'm surprised UI uses POS selectors
[14:50:18] <DaveMethvin> they don't call it POS for nothing
[14:51:21] <DaveMethvin> okay, i'm off to dinner
[15:07:15] <gnarf> hey guys - I'm probably going to take trac down at some point later today so I can get a nice point in time backup of the DB/Files to play with on a staging box
