[05:27:24] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: I believe Apple still uses their proprietary system, but I don't know for sure since their fork of WebKit isn't public.
[05:27:44] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: Apple is also the only browser vendor that hasn't shown any interest in implementing Pointer Events.
[05:28:26] <scott_gonzalez> The original Mozilla Touch Events had a very different API based on streams, but Mozilla eventually replaced it with the WebKit variant.

[06:01:24] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I think http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14715 is invalid, but I figured I'd set it to pending for feedback from the reporter.
[06:02:06] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's fine
[06:02:19] <DaveMethvin> even if it's valid there's not likely anything we can do
[06:07:23] <m_gol> we have solely failures due to this IE11 not connecting properly
[06:08:02] <m_gol> who knows this infrastructure well enough to be able to pinpoint the reason in a short amount of time?
[06:13:05] <gnarf> i can help look a bit

[06:16:39] <jzaefferer> m_gol gnarf: is there an infrastructure issue or similar to read up on the IE11 issue?
[06:17:12] <jzaefferer> I don't look in IRC most of the time unless there's a reason, only just now heard from Dave that's there still testing issues blocking the release
[06:17:19] <m_gol> I can open an issue
[06:20:57] <m_gol> jzaefferer gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/234
[06:23:56] <gnarf> testswarm-browserstack isn't finding IE 11
[06:24:33] <jzaefferer> gnarf m_gol: responded there
[06:25:08] <gnarf> its just that testswarm-browserstack isn't spawning any IE11's jzaefferer 
[06:26:02] <jzaefferer> gnarf: why? This looks like IE11 is running just fine: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2379
[06:26:20] <gnarf> looks like someone ran it manually
[06:26:44] <gnarf> IE11 has 287 runs pending on the swarm status page
[06:29:00] <m_gol> hmm, now it seems tests did run: http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jquery
[06:29:05] <m_gol> after a few days
[06:29:21] <m_gol> before that there was a clock icon, indicating it didn't even connect
[06:29:49] <jzaefferer> m_gol: did you try to run tests manually?
[06:29:54] <m_gol> no
[06:29:57] <m_gol> maybe timmywil
[06:33:35] <gnarf> browserstack is not reporting IE11 as a browser : https://gist.github.com/gnarf/8714c5752b4550aec1db
[06:33:44] <gnarf> or at least node-browserstack isnt
[06:34:41] <m_gol> gnarf: there's a separate URL for API, can you check that directly?
[06:34:55] <m_gol> I mean, for pure BrowserStack
[06:35:11] <m_gol> I believe the URL is http://api.browserstack.com/2/browsers
[06:35:23] <gnarf> it is
[06:35:34] <gnarf> if you notice
[06:35:36] <gnarf> ie 11 is not listed
[06:35:50] <m_gol> I don't have access to this URL so I couldn't check
[06:36:05] <jzaefferer> houw about their v3 api?
[06:36:07] <gnarf> you have a u/p for browserstack yeah?
[06:36:14] <m_gol> ah, this will work?
[06:36:27] <gnarf> ie is listed in the v3 api
[06:36:48] <gnarf> but node-browserstack and testswarm-browserstack need to update then
[06:36:50] <jzaefferer> you mean ie11?
[06:37:00] <gnarf> yes, specifically ie11
[06:37:00] <gnarf> :)
[06:37:02] <jzaefferer> well, node-browserstack is owned by scott_gonzalez
[06:37:17] <m_gol> heh
[06:37:31] <m_gol> ok, so we have to open an issue with BrowserStack
[06:37:34] <scott_gonzalez> node-browserstack@latest already supports v3.
[06:37:37] <jzaefferer> not the one: https://npmjs.org/package/node-browserstack
[06:37:51] <jzaefferer> this one: https://npmjs.org/package/browserstack
[06:38:15] <jzaefferer> m_gol: no, just update https://github.com/clarkbox/testswarm-browserstack
[06:38:21] <scott_gonzalez> v3 support is included as of v1.0.0, which was released 5 months ago :-)
[06:38:32] <m_gol> ok, I see
[06:38:36] <m_gol> http://api.browserstack.com/3/browsers has it
[06:39:17] <m_gol> This script is currently compatible with: BrowserStack API v1
[06:39:18] <m_gol> :)
[06:39:24] <jzaefferer> I have push access to that repo, so I can land PRs
[06:39:33] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder why that guy created node-browserstack.
[06:39:34] <jzaefferer> the update to v2 looked like this: https://github.com/clarkbox/testswarm-browserstack/pull/33/files
[06:39:39] <gnarf> someone needs to update testswarm-browserstack
[06:40:30] <gnarf> m_gol: if you want to take this and work on it - you can run testswarm-browserstack locally to test
[06:40:43] <gnarf> grab the config.json from /tools/testswarm-browserstack on jq03
[06:40:57] <m_gol> ok, I'll try
[06:41:00] <gnarf> i don't have time to update testswarm-browserstack to be v3 api compat
[06:41:02] <jzaefferer> testswarm-browserstack isn't on npm, so we just need a PR, merge that and update our copy on the actual server
[06:42:25] <gnarf> okay
[06:42:25] <gnarf> so
[06:42:29] <gnarf> when looking at a repo
[06:42:33] <gnarf> how can i tell if i have push? :)
[06:42:57] <gnarf> the clone url used to say "read only" or "read write"
[06:43:01] <gnarf> but seems they dropped that
[06:43:54] <jzaefferer> I ended up clicking on a file, then "Edit" and looking at the URL...
[06:44:05] <jzaefferer> since it didn't go to a fork, I must have push access, right?
[06:44:14] <gnarf> no
[06:45:00] <gnarf> but it does give you this nice warning: https://npmjs.org/package/browserstack
[06:45:08] <m_gol> if the clone URL begins with git@, you have push access
[06:45:11] <gnarf> paste fail: http://cl.ly/image/1E1M1W0Z3p3J
[06:45:17] <gnarf> m_gol: also not true
[06:46:00] <m_gol> hmm, so when can such a situation happen?
[06:46:07] <m_gol> gnarf: git@ + no push?
[06:46:15] <gnarf> anytime 
[06:46:34] <gnarf> also some people have https as default anyway
[06:46:42] <m_gol> well, I don't see git@ if I don't have push in the repo
[06:46:48] <gnarf> you can clone any github repo: git@github.com:username/repo.git
[06:47:01] <m_gol> maybe, but I don't see this URL suggested in GitHub UI
[06:47:08] <gnarf> i see the SSH url on every repo
[06:47:21] <gnarf> even debt, which i don't have write to
[06:47:26] <m_gol> weird
[06:47:36] <m_gol> I see https for such repos
[06:48:12] <jzaefferer> Just submitted a support request for that, let's see if anything comes back
[06:48:38] <gnarf> https://twitter.com/gnarf/status/426003423163473920
[06:48:38] <b-ot> gnarf: @gnarf: Dear @github - How can I tell by just looking at a repo if I have push access? The "read only" by the clone url seems to have disappeared...
[06:48:55] <gnarf> i went with the "TDD = Twitter Driven Development" policy :)
[06:49:00] <m_gol> ;)
[06:50:11] <jzaefferer> Do you ever get replies from @github on Twitter?
[06:50:34] <gnarf> not from @github
[06:50:37] <gnarf> but from githubbers
[06:50:58] <jzaefferer> okay
[06:51:05] <gnarf> let me know how your support request goes though
[06:51:20] <gnarf> strange that they just let that somewhat useful bit of information fall away

[07:02:43] <timmywil> jzaefferer, gnarf, m_gol: yea, I ran some tests manually to see if IE11 was recognized by the swarm, which it was
[07:19:59] <jzaefferer> timmywil m_gol: In general its a good idea to handle testing infra issues like any other issue: Write a ticket, provide all the necessary context; if its urgent, ping me
[07:20:08] <m_gol> ok
[07:20:21] <m_gol> working on testswarm-browserstack currently
[07:20:25] <jzaefferer> cool
[07:24:27] <jzaefferer> in this case, a feature request "Add IE11 for testing" would probably have been good; or did I miss that?
[07:39:35] <timmywil> jzaefferer: There was an issue on the testswarm repo. I like to rule out things before opening issues for other people to solve.
[07:40:02] <timmywil> but it's helpful to remember I can open issues on the infra repo

[07:54:06] <jzaefferer> timmywil: this one? https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/pull/297
[07:54:22] <timmywil> I believe there was more than one
[07:55:03] <timmywil> Ah, there's one still open https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/284
[07:55:39] <timmywil> I'm still not sure the heart of the issue, but I no longer suspect testswarm
[07:56:10] <jzaefferer> well, there's no link to the ua-parse ticket or PR, but since TestSwarm recognizes IE11, that seems to be solved
[07:56:18] <timmywil> right
[07:56:45] <timmywil> but it sounds like we know where the problem is now
[07:56:50] <jzaefferer> yeah
[07:57:20] <jzaefferer> so yes, an infrastructure ticket is more useful with issues like that, since there's several pieces involved to add a new browser
[07:58:02] <timmywil> thanks, I'll remember that for the future
[07:58:36] <m_gol> jzaefferer: can you look? https://github.com/clarkbox/testswarm-browserstack/pull/40
[07:58:52] <jzaefferer> timmywil: also, if its urgent and no one responds, ping me directly
[07:59:14] <m_gol> btw, I get some warnings so maybe there's still sth wrong here
[07:59:18] <m_gol> like: [Wed, 22 Jan 2014 15:55:30 GMT] action=warning {"message":"Found worker for which there is no match in UA map","info":{"id":98388,"status":"running","browser":{"os":"win","device":"ie"}}}
[07:59:29] <timmywil> jzaefferer: sure
[07:59:29] <m_gol> how to best check if everything is properly recognized?
[08:01:39] <jzaefferer> m_gol: I wish I could answer that. Where/how did you get that warning?
[08:02:06] <m_gol> when I run node src/cli.js --run -v in terminal
[08:02:15] <m_gol> in testswarm-browserstack, on my brach
[08:02:17] <m_gol> * branch

[10:04:54] <leobalter> hello, I need a quick information on code convention: function calls taking only one argument requires a space between the ()? Example: expect(2);
[10:05:00] <m_gol> wow, this time Safari 5.1 screwed up
[10:05:19] <m_gol> leobalter: yup, spaces, e.g. expect( 2 )

[10:05:58] <leobalter> there's a lot to fix on QUnit code :)
[10:07:06] <leobalter> other (and last): unnamed function expressions requires a space between `function` and the ()? Example: `function ()` or `function()`

[11:57:18] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Don't forget to close http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14664
[12:06:19] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: so you want to wait for .1 before landing http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14716?
[12:06:59] <DaveMethvin> working on it now m_gol but i think it may be unwise to change it so close to the release
[12:07:05] <m_gol> ok
[12:07:06] <DaveMethvin> i'll see how it looks
[12:07:25] <m_gol> I was asking bc I want to add support matrixes for IE11 & Safari 7, they're missing
[12:07:43] <DaveMethvin> kind of related, do we need all those operas?
[12:07:44] <m_gol> so I'll have to set noCloneChecked to true, just change it to false once you land this one
[12:07:56] <m_gol> I was thinking about it...
[12:08:00] <DaveMethvin> are we supporting 3 now?
[12:08:04] <m_gol> yes
[12:08:08] <DaveMethvin> the old opera, plus the two most recent
[12:08:09] <m_gol> latest 12.1x & last 2
[12:08:10] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[12:08:13] <m_gol> ;)
[12:08:28] <DaveMethvin> it's all your fault in poland i bet
[12:08:30] <m_gol> I have 7% Opera 12.1x visitors on http://polona.pl
[12:08:34] <DaveMethvin> SEE
[12:08:37] <m_gol> ;)
[12:08:42] <DaveMethvin> this is why we can't have nice things :)
[12:09:06] <m_gol> well, I could point out why we still need IE6&7 :P
[12:09:14] <m_gol> (looking at you, USA & China)
[12:09:23] <DaveMethvin> hey usa doesn't need ie6
[12:09:28] <DaveMethvin> and ie7 is pretty small now
[12:09:31] <DaveMethvin> it's that darned ie8
[12:09:39] <m_gol> hm, ok, maybe corporations make it seem worse than it is
[12:09:58] <m_gol> but y'know, it's only because no one in USA uses Opera
[12:10:06] <m_gol> they don't update people from 12.1x :(
[12:10:15] <m_gol> "You have the latest version"
[12:10:16] <m_gol> liar
[12:10:33] <DaveMethvin> "you have the latest version not written by google"
[12:10:49] <m_gol> as for newer Operas, this is another question
[12:11:00] <m_gol> Krinkle argued we should test them since we support them
[12:11:13] <m_gol> OTH, paul_irish said that, at least for now, they're completely identical engine-wise
[12:11:23] <m_gol> so it's not like Safari, Chrome & all those different WebKit forks
[12:11:34] <DaveMethvin> it's just that our matrix is getting SO WIDE
[12:11:41] <m_gol> it'll get wider
[12:11:48] <DaveMethvin> i think we should seriously drop IE6/7 in 1.12
[12:11:48] <m_gol> once I find time to add iOS 7 & 6 ;)
[12:12:01] <m_gol> & Android 4.4, 4.3, 4.2, 4.1, 4.0 & 2.3 :P
[12:12:17] <m_gol> well, I won't object :)
[12:12:29] <m_gol> I'd like to drop Safari 5.x as well though I figure you might object ;)
[12:12:33] <scott_gonzalez> Whatever happened to the Facebook browser?
[12:12:35] <DaveMethvin> not me!
[12:12:36] <scott_gonzalez> Did that ever happen?
[12:12:39] <DaveMethvin> i hope not
[12:12:50] <scott_gonzalez> me too
[12:12:51] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: well, doesn't your wife have the 1st iPad? :D
[12:13:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah now my daughter does so it's not here
[12:13:09] <m_gol> what Facebook browser? oh god
[12:13:10] <m_gol> hahaha
[12:13:24] <m_gol> bc you know, iPad 1 is 4 years old
[12:13:30] <m_gol> Safari 5 - 3 years old
[12:13:32] <DaveMethvin> at the rate people upgrade jquery it won't matter if we drop ie 6/7
[12:13:43] <m_gol> and it's not like we *really* ever supported iOS5 - it fails >60 tests in our suite
[12:14:07] * DaveMethvin whistles while looking the other way
[12:14:08] <m_gol> compare it to iOS6 (1 failure) & 7 (2 failures)
[12:14:35] <m_gol> and Safari 5.1 for some reason executes tests SO SLOW
[12:14:41] <m_gol> that even Jenkins consistently timeouts on it
[12:14:55] <m_gol> even though it's green on swarmy
[12:15:20] <DaveMethvin> if you run them one module at a time it is usually fine, that's what swarmy does
[12:15:34] <m_gol> yeah, but it takes about an hour
[12:15:43] <m_gol> idk why but it's what has been happening recently
[12:15:44] <DaveMethvin> ie is a bit strange, if you run a full test it always takes a LOOOONG time on sizzle
[12:15:54] <DaveMethvin> right near the end
[12:15:58] <m_gol> ;)
[12:16:11] <m_gol> yeah, and it hangs the browser completely
[12:16:21] <DaveMethvin> right, whatever it is doing is using the ui thread
[12:16:57] <m_gol> btw, I now know how to add browsers to swarmy ;)
[12:17:11] <DaveMethvin> yeah, thanks for taking care of that!
[12:17:19] <m_gol> I just wanted to add one browser and it ended with switching API versions :P
[12:17:33] <DaveMethvin> i think just about everything needed an update for that
[12:18:17] <m_gol> as for ie6/7, should we just stop testing them or remove quirks specific for them?
[12:18:35] <m_gol> the same with Safari 5, there is quite significant amount of code for its gCS bugs
[12:18:44] <m_gol> * 5.1
[12:18:48] <DaveMethvin> i think if we stop testing we should consider removing the stuff we're no longer testing
[12:19:00] <DaveMethvin> otherwise we'll break it accidentally
[12:19:00] <m_gol> I agree
[12:19:10] <m_gol> and we'll have it both not working & bloated :P
[12:19:43] <m_gol> so let's not take new team members from China before releasing 2.2 ]:->
[12:19:52] <DaveMethvin> haha
[12:20:17] <m_gol> "sorry, you weren't on the team back then" :P
[12:20:56] <m_gol> I wonder which Android versions we want to really test
[12:21:03] <DaveMethvin> damn, should have dumped Opera a while back when we had the chance
[12:21:08] <m_gol> 4.4, 4.3, 4.2, 4.1, 4.0, 2.3 seems like too many :P
[12:21:12] <m_gol> ;)
[12:21:33] <DaveMethvin> on android 4.x are most phones doing the auto upgrade thing?
[12:21:47] <DaveMethvin> oh wait, google has a marketshare page

[12:31:48] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: yup, exactly the same version
[12:32:02] <DaveMethvin> oh well
[12:32:09] <DaveMethvin> i will just fix what i came here to fix
[12:32:21] <m_gol> ;)
[12:32:25] <DaveMethvin> it's strange, master works fine but 1.x is throwing this
[12:32:51] <DaveMethvin> couldn't cherry pick b/c the code for support detects is so different in 1.x, a LOT more detects

[12:43:02] <DaveMethvin> i'm sorry scott_gonzalez i thought you said IE7
[12:43:14] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:43:34] <scott_gonzalez> I thought we were just talking about how great it is that we still get to test against IE6/7 :-P
[12:43:45] <DaveMethvin> it's been a few years but doesn't ie7 put padding or margin on the HTML element or something stupid like that?
[12:43:56] <scott_gonzalez> Probably.
[12:44:06] <DaveMethvin> shouldn't affect that tho
[12:44:08] <scott_gonzalez> This is .outerWidth() on <select> though.
[12:44:39] <DaveMethvin> i remember some strangeness on buttons, maybe related
[12:44:44] <scott_gonzalez> Could be.
[12:45:19] <scott_gonzalez> Probably some crazy IE-only internal implementation of box-sizing :-P
[12:45:20] <m_gol> hmm, Safari 7 doesn't pass the regex I just pushed
[12:45:23] <m_gol> weird, works locally
[12:45:43] <scott_gonzalez> Because, you know, MS likes to innovate on stuff years before anyone else and then not mention it.
[12:48:40] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: i see what it's doing, subtracting out the border, but dunno why
[12:48:49] <DaveMethvin> if you set a thicker border it gets smaller
[12:49:25] <scott_gonzalez> Is the problem in the reading or the writing?

[13:11:48] <doesallmagic2> m.goleb: Tests: fix Safari userAgent detection
[13:14:44] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: this was the ticket i was thinking of http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4146
[13:14:51] <DaveMethvin> seems to be what you found
[13:15:19] <DaveMethvin> some fiddles are in there that you could augment to see if it's the same for select
[13:15:38] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that's .width().
[13:15:50] <scott_gonzalez> elem.outerWidth( x ).outerWidth() should always return x.
[13:16:07] <scott_gonzalez> .outerWidth() will take box-sizing into account so it can set the proper value for .width.
[13:16:19] <scott_gonzalez> But then the border needs to be added back to that value for the getter.
[13:16:23] <DaveMethvin> yep but if it's calculating width elements incorrectly ... i dunno
[13:17:12] <DaveMethvin> it seemed like for that case the border was being considered part of the offsetWidth when it isn't
[13:17:31] <DaveMethvin> which is gonna ruin the other calcs most likely
[13:18:11] <scott_gonzalez> I think I've ruled out the setter as the problem.
[13:21:04] <scott_gonzalez> Debugging in IE7 is not fun :-P
[13:22:08] <DaveMethvin> not at all
[13:23:01] <scott_gonzalez> So, I think this is a case of selects behaving as box-sizing: border-box, but not actually having box-sizing.
[13:23:24] <scott_gonzalez> I could be wrong though.
[13:24:08] <scott_gonzalez> Getting very close to finding where the problem is.
[13:24:10] <scott_gonzalez> I think...
[13:24:16] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i think that is what the ticket was saying too
[13:24:57] <DaveMethvin> you can get that by putting an explicit border on the select and it does give lower numbres
[13:25:00] <DaveMethvin> numbers

[13:27:36] <doesallmagic2> m.goleb: Tests: fix Safari userAgent detection
[13:27:53] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Yup, inside augmentWidthOrHeight(), i = 4.
[13:28:03] <scott_gonzalez> And it's skipping the part where it adds the border.
[13:32:12] <m_gol> ha, we had incorrect support results for Safari 5.1 for at least 2-3 years
[13:32:20] <m_gol> but UA didn't match so it wasn't discovered :P
[13:32:55] <DaveMethvin> btw scott_gonzalez this fails the same way for IE11 and latest Chrome ... you expected 100, right?

[13:44:14] <scott_gonzalez> Now you're on the hook :-P
[13:44:54] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, I should've read this more closely. Every time it's been discussed it's just been IE7.
[13:45:07] <DaveMethvin> but it's not really, is it?
[13:45:12] <scott_gonzalez> As you said, would've been good to know it was more than that.
[13:45:15] <DaveMethvin> seems like it's every browser
[13:45:43] <scott_gonzalez> Well, our tests pass in other browsers. So that's interesting.
[13:45:56] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe other browsers aren't putting a border on <select> by default?
[13:47:16] <DaveMethvin> nothing more than your test at http://jsbin.com/uyufEVAn/1/edit with no extra styles fails
[13:48:08] <DaveMethvin> fails the same way in ff, chrome, ie
[13:48:16] <DaveMethvin> latests
[13:48:22] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[13:48:32] <scott_gonzalez> Works in Chrome 30.
[13:48:37] <DaveMethvin> and it's definitely the border
[13:48:43] <DaveMethvin> you mean it gives you 100?
[13:48:46] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:48:58] <m_gol> I get 100 in Chrome 32

[13:49:26] <m_gol> but 73 in Fx
[13:49:40] <scott_gonzalez> Whoa. 73 is definitely wrong.
[13:49:48] <scott_gonzalez> That sounds like the setter didn't work at all.
[13:49:56] <DaveMethvin> chrome 32 gives me 98
[13:50:12] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Try adjusting your timezone again :-P
[13:50:14] <m_gol> os-specific?
[13:50:21] <DaveMethvin> lol
[13:50:30] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, it probably is OS-specific.
[13:50:32] <m_gol> we have a new way of OS sniffing
[13:50:42] <scott_gonzalez> Chrome uses OS X native selects by default.
[13:50:43] <DaveMethvin> no the setter is working
[13:50:54] <DaveMethvin> but it's not handling the border right
[13:51:21] <DaveMethvin> try adding an explicit border of 5px, the width gets smaller by 10px
[13:51:25] <DaveMethvin> left and right
[13:51:27] <m_gol> yup, 98 on Win7 in Chrome 32
[13:51:30] <DaveMethvin> just like that old ticket
[13:51:45] <DaveMethvin> whoa, os-dependent
[13:51:50] <DaveMethvin> now that's a surprise
[13:52:03] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, this is definitely wrong: http://jsbin.com/uyufEVAn/5/edit
[13:52:13] <DaveMethvin> and none of you ever sees it because you're on macs
[13:52:28] <DaveMethvin> that's a good demo of it
[13:52:52] <scott_gonzalez> So it is the setter.
[13:52:59] <scott_gonzalez> HOW ABOUT THAT!
[13:53:33] <scott_gonzalez> Well, this is typical of bugs that bubble up from UI to core, right?
[13:53:39] <DaveMethvin> and http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4146 WAS broken, but i guess timmywil didn't see it on a mac?
[13:53:40] <scott_gonzalez> They're always the crazy ones.
[13:53:45] <scott_gonzalez> could be
[13:53:54] <DaveMethvin> cuz it is working on chrome/ff on a mac?
[13:54:37] <scott_gonzalez> It's hard to tell which fiddle to look at in that ticket.
[13:55:53] <DaveMethvin> all my browsers are showing the wrong behavior here
[13:56:05] <DaveMethvin> not worth reopening that one, might as well start clean
[13:56:21] <DaveMethvin> although i should mention i posted the original test case 5 years ago :)
[13:56:36] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:56:49] <DaveMethvin> before jsfiddle
[13:56:53] <scott_gonzalez> It only took 5 years and a failure in TestSwarm, but we're finally getting there :-P
[13:57:08] <DaveMethvin> see, who says there's not progress?
[13:57:35] <DaveMethvin> very strange, even tho they're all broken they're broken differently
[13:57:58] <scott_gonzalez> heh, State of jQuery 2015: We fixed a 5 year old.
[13:58:03] <DaveMethvin> firefox http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/91a22d.png
[13:58:27] <DaveMethvin> ie11 http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/34fc33.png
[13:58:41] <scott_gonzalez> Wow, that's quite a difference.
[13:58:56] <scott_gonzalez> It's not even coming close to rendering the border widths the same.
[13:58:56] <DaveMethvin> chrome http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/2de449.png
[13:59:37] <DaveMethvin> well the default border for IE must be "inset"
[14:00:32] <DaveMethvin> oh one of those is 20 and the others 10
[14:00:46] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, that makes more sense.
[14:00:53] <DaveMethvin> anyway, they're ugly and messed up
[14:00:56] <scott_gonzalez> Stupid unlocked bins.
[14:01:09] <scott_gonzalez> They sure are.
[14:01:28] <scott_gonzalez> Gotta go.
[14:02:48] <m_gol> so know we should test every browser separately on OS X & Windows, right? :P
[14:03:08] <DaveMethvin> yeah these are the kind of bugs that really get scary
[14:03:37] <DaveMethvin> it's just amazing that nobody reported it again after the initial one 5 years ago
[14:03:56] <DaveMethvin> although #4146 was relatively active in its day :)
[14:04:26] <m_gol> maybe they believed they're the only ones that see this bug ;P
[14:04:53] <DaveMethvin> "Some say the bug is still there TO THIS VERY DAY" (flashlight)
[14:06:26] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: that's after-11 p.m. material
[14:07:18] <m_gol> 5 years is not a lot
[14:07:25] <m_gol> Mozilla has bugs sitting for more
[14:07:36] <m_gol> this one nears its 10-year anniversary: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=243412
[14:07:39] <DaveMethvin> sure, but they've been around a lot longer!
[14:08:43] <m_gol> you mean in 20 years we'll be fixing 25-year-old bugs? :-)
[14:09:10] <DaveMethvin> in 20 years I want to be watching a sunset in Hawaii :)
[14:09:15] <m_gol> :)
[14:31:58] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: that ticket was before we decided to respect box-sizing
[14:32:06] <timmywil> boosh: invalid
[14:32:24] <DaveMethvin> the form elements seem to have some strange behavior timmywil 
[14:32:30] <DaveMethvin> at least on Windows!
[14:32:48] <timmywil> even when CSS is normalized?
[14:33:15] <DaveMethvin> well, take scott's test case above and fix it the way you think it should be
[14:33:28] <DaveMethvin> http://jsbin.com/uyufEVAn/5/edit
[14:34:01] <DaveMethvin> it could be an issue with the default stylesheet, i guess you're saying use border-box explicitly?
[14:35:35] <timmywil> http://jsbin.com/uyufEVAn/7
[14:36:04] <timmywil> but that doesn't mean we shouldn't account for it
[14:36:37] <timmywil> It's been debated a lot, but I defer to mikesherov 
[14:42:38] <timmywil> It think the behavior is due to outerWidth explicitly defining how it deals with padding and border, whereas .width() is more generic http://jsbin.com/uyufEVAn/9/edit
[14:43:54] <timmywil> The behavior makes sense to me, but I agree it could be confusing.
[14:44:01] <timmywil> DaveMethvin
[14:44:40] <DaveMethvin> we can turn it into a docs item but just need to figure out where that needs to be done
[14:44:55] <DaveMethvin> outerWidth outerHeight for sure
[14:45:07] <DaveMethvin> it's the default stylesheets that seem to bite us here
[14:45:16] <DaveMethvin> and in ie7 you can't set content-box
[14:45:26] <DaveMethvin> it's a mysterious unnamed world
[14:46:01] <timmywil> actually, we made this decision a while ago and I don't think we updated the docs: "Note that .width("value") sets the content width of the box regardless of the value of the CSS box-sizing property."
[14:46:11] <timmywil> that's not true anymore
[14:46:34] <DaveMethvin> it's not?
[14:46:53] <DaveMethvin> if it's border-box, i think .width() subtracts out border/padding
[14:47:23] <timmywil> right, but would't that be "regarding" the value of box-sizing?
[14:48:11] <timmywil> or am I crazy
[14:48:20] <m_gol> It "regards" box-sizing in a sense that it returns content-box *regardless* of box-sizing value
[14:48:22] <m_gol> makes sense to me
[14:49:12] <timmywil> yea I'm crazy, that's right
[14:49:15] <m_gol> this "regarding" is in implementation since we have to check box-sizing to know if/what to substract
[14:49:16] <DaveMethvin> we can reword that
[14:50:22] <timmywil> it makes sense from the user's perspective. My head's into the implementation.
[14:50:25] <DaveMethvin> given that this seems like an "implicit" border-box situation that we can't easily detect, it would be better for people to use CSS to make it explicit
[14:50:34] <DaveMethvin> but we need to document that
[14:50:49] <DaveMethvin> and that still leaves IE7 out in the cold
[14:50:52] <DaveMethvin> poor IE7
[14:50:54] <DaveMethvin> hahahaa
[14:51:08] <timmywil> :/
[14:52:01] <m_gol> yet another reason to dump it :P
[14:52:32] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: are you keeping a list of pros? does it already have 1000 entries?
[14:52:36] <timmywil> we've had this conversation too much. I think it best to leave the behavior where it is.
[14:53:07] <DaveMethvin> i'm okay for leaving the behavior as long as we document it so we don't have to converse again :)
[14:53:32] <DaveMethvin> esp since a css fix will make it work for non-ancient browsers
[14:53:35] <timmywil> agreed
[14:54:04] <DaveMethvin> so we just need to convince scott_gonzalez and that's easy since he's a pushover
[14:54:12] <DaveMethvin> uuuuhg, how do i delete a message :)

[19:04:23] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Too late ;-)
[19:04:35] <DaveMethvin> wat
[19:04:35] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: The new icon changes your desktop look really professional!
[19:05:02] <scott_gonzalez> Also, I'm going to need to write some really disgusting code to fix this in UI.
[19:05:18] <scott_gonzalez> $.support.hasBorkedOuterwidthForSelect = ...
[19:05:27] <DaveMethvin> can't you just force it to content-width
[19:05:37] <scott_gonzalez> IE7?
[19:05:39] <DaveMethvin> as long as you don't care about ie6/7
[19:05:55] <DaveMethvin> honestly we should talk about dropping those
[19:05:59] <m_gol> it's probable we'll drop IE7 in 1.12/2.2
[19:06:01] <m_gol> right
[19:06:07] <scott_gonzalez> We don't have IE7 support removal scheduled until UI 1.13.
[19:06:13] <scott_gonzalez> Selectmenu is planned for 1.11.
[19:06:21] <scott_gonzalez> You think it should move up?
[19:06:32] <scott_gonzalez> Bring out the stats!
[19:06:38] <DaveMethvin> how can you schedule that? we need stat!
[19:06:42] <DaveMethvin> stats stat!
[19:06:47] <m_gol> stats say IE7 is used far less than IE6 :-)
[19:06:52] <DaveMethvin> right
[19:06:54] <DaveMethvin> that's what i thought
[19:07:15] <scott_gonzalez> akamai says 4.6%
[19:07:18] <DaveMethvin> and if someone wants to support ie6 they can use an older version
[19:07:29] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: akamai says you're a big fat liar :-)
[19:07:45] <DaveMethvin> i'd seen several sources that ie7<ie6
[19:07:59] <scott_gonzalez> show me
[19:08:14] <DaveMethvin> it's hard to know who's right, but even for ie6countdown it seems that the only big loss would be for china
[19:08:31] <scott_gonzalez> We already dropped IE6 in UI.
[19:09:03] <DaveMethvin> ok scott_gonzalez here's  PROOF http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_explorer.asp
[19:09:04] <m_gol> according to http://www.netmarketshare.com/
[19:09:05] <DaveMethvin> ?cc
[19:09:05] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: CASE CLOASED >:|
[19:09:37] <DaveMethvin> you can't argue with w3fools!
[19:09:39] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: That shows IE7 > IE6
[19:09:53] <m_gol> IE7 though net applications generally show higher IE usage than other sources
[19:11:23] <m_gol> http://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-browser_version_partially_combined-ww-weekly-201350-201403-bar
[19:11:29] <m_gol> here also IE6>IE7
[19:11:44] <m_gol> (you need to download the CSV to see it as both are in "Other")
[19:12:08] <DaveMethvin> both ie6 and ie7 are flatlined there
[19:12:25] <DaveMethvin> not 4.6%
[19:12:40] <m_gol> or look at these graphs: http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/01/windows-8-x-breaks-10-percent-internet-explorer-11-makes-a-splash/
[19:12:51] <m_gol> http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ie-2013-12.png
[19:13:43] <m_gol> also, I doubt people supporting IE7 rush to download the newest & greatest jQuery
[19:13:44] <DaveMethvin> well arstechnica seals it, dropping IE6 was a mistake for UI!
[19:13:48] <DaveMethvin> :)
[19:13:52] <m_gol> ]:->
[19:14:33] <scott_gonzalez> Isn't looking at arstechnica stats like looking at jQuery stats?
[19:14:44] <DaveMethvin> i think that's the key, so many sites are potted and don't change versions during their lifetime
[19:14:57] <DaveMethvin> are new sites being built to work with ie6/7?
[19:15:03] <m_gol> these are not Ars Technica stats, they're taken from netmarketshare.com
[19:15:17] <m_gol> they just drew pretty graphs
[19:15:23] <scott_gonzalez> So you're trying to double up on your most promising stats? :-P
[19:15:28] <m_gol> ;P
[19:15:45] <m_gol> well, most cited are Net Applications & Statcounter
[19:15:49] <m_gol> both show IE6>IE7
[19:16:03] <DaveMethvin> i'd be really happy to wipe ie6/7 off our list with 1.12/2.2
[19:17:03] <DaveMethvin> i wonder, for these reports of ie7 problems, are they from USERS or from DEVS who test in a vm or browserstack?
[19:17:27] <DaveMethvin> but of course for this particular issue, it still happens in ie11 or chrome or firefox on windows
[19:17:34] <DaveMethvin> so you still have to work around it scott_gonzalez 
[19:17:59] <scott_gonzalez> Whoa, just now seeing the new org pages: https://github.com/jquery/
[19:18:34] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but if we can use box-sizing, then it's easier to work around.
[19:18:42] <scott_gonzalez> Which is what you want us to do.
[19:18:54] <DaveMethvin> not really sure why the box-sizing changes on windows, that part doesn't make sense to me
[19:18:57] <scott_gonzalez> Go ahead and drop IE6/7 in core. Then you'll make the decision for us :-)
[19:19:02] <m_gol> I wonder how much IE6-7 traffic comes from devs testing on them :P
[19:19:18] <scott_gonzalez> Probably very little.
[19:19:29] <DaveMethvin> so m_gol  what i'm hearing is that scott_gonzalez doesn't want to jump, he wants us to push him
[19:19:32] <scott_gonzalez> Devs testing in old browsers generally test local or staging sites.
[19:19:55] <scott_gonzalez> Yes. Force me into dropping IE7 like I was forced into supporting AMD.
[19:20:08] <scott_gonzalez> Then I can say "Hey, don't blame me!" :-)
[19:20:30] <DaveMethvin> you could always say UI doesn't work with the latest core
[19:20:30] <scott_gonzalez> I was just sitting in my house, banging my head on my desk because my markdown parser doesn't have hooks for the inline lexer.
[19:20:46] <scott_gonzalez> CANNOT
[19:20:50] <DaveMethvin> okay i have to go do some stuff
[19:20:54] <scott_gonzalez> We support like 30 versions of core.
[19:21:01] <scott_gonzalez> It's oh so fun.
[19:21:20] <scott_gonzalez> I think literally every other person on UI would be happy if we dropped IE7.
[19:21:20] <m_gol> in Poland IE7 has higher market share than IE6
[19:21:35] <scott_gonzalez> See, why you gotta be racist DaveMethvin?
[19:21:37] <m_gol> 0.42% vs. 0.09%
[19:21:41] <m_gol> :P
[19:22:10] <scott_gonzalez> Which browser versions should we support to draw more women into the field of web development?!?
[19:22:46] <m_gol> IE market share is funny; 11 > 8 > 9 > 10 > 7 > 6
[19:23:07] <scott_gonzalez> Look, you just put 7 in front of 6 :-P
[19:23:12] <m_gol> looking at Polish stats
[19:23:19] <m_gol> so yeah, 0.42% > 0.09%
[19:23:21] <scott_gonzalez> Certainly seems Polish to me :-P
[19:23:59] <m_gol> as for devs testing, I sometimes go to sites I use in BrowserStack & see how they break in IE6
[19:25:00] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[19:48:16] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: why do you need to support such ancient core versions in UI?
[19:48:27] <scott_gonzalez> Because they're populare.
[19:48:39] <scott_gonzalez> We don't actually support 30 versions :-P
[19:48:40] <m_gol> ok, fair enough
[19:48:42] <m_gol> ;)
[19:48:58] <scott_gonzalez> Just 21...
[19:49:03] <m_gol> so if API changes you need to smooth the differences I guess
[19:49:10] <scott_gonzalez> Everything from 1.6 - 2.0.3
[19:49:17] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[19:49:23] <m_gol> well, patch releases don't add a lot, I suppose
[19:49:34] <m_gol> still, 7 versions is still a lot
[19:49:39] <scott_gonzalez> It also means that we can't use new APIs for long time.
[19:49:55] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.core.js#L144-L211
[19:50:18] <m_gol> that looks like a lot of code
[19:50:23] <scott_gonzalez> When we switch to using AMD (soon), old version support will move to its own file.
[19:50:33] <scott_gonzalez> And then we'll add a checkbox on download builder to support old versions.
[19:50:50] <scott_gonzalez> But even without that box checked, the rest of our code can't use new APIs.
[19:51:27] <scott_gonzalez> If you think that's a lot of code, you should see our support matrix when you multiple jQuery versions by supported browsers :-P
[19:51:32] <m_gol> 1.6 tests don't look too green ;) http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2383
[19:51:40] <m_gol> haha, true
[19:51:57] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we've got some issues.
[19:52:03] <m_gol> and the OS, multiply by 2
[19:52:03] <scott_gonzalez> We're working on getting everything green again.
[19:52:08] <m_gol> as we've seen today
[19:52:14] <scott_gonzalez> heh, yeah
[19:52:24] <scott_gonzalez> Then throw in various screen readers.
[19:52:42] <m_gol> and all gazillion WebKit forks
[19:52:55] <scott_gonzalez> At least that's not a full multiplier, since there are only certain combinations we support.
[19:53:26] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that swarm job doesn't even touch mobile devices.
[19:53:41] <scott_gonzalez> The support matrix is crazy.
[19:54:32] <m_gol> iOS is pretty close to pass the core test suite
[19:54:39] <m_gol> at least 6 & 7
[19:55:00] <m_gol> 5 fails, like, 70 tests ]:->
[19:55:50] <m_gol> it might even beat Android 2.3
[19:56:09] <m_gol> from the bottom
[20:30:24] <m_gol> iOS has window.onbeforeunload except it does nothing
[20:30:31] <m_gol> SO GREAT
