[06:18:46] <jaubourg> hi there
[06:22:43] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: I cced you on #9827 to have some feedback
[06:22:48] <jaubourg> ?#9827
[06:22:50] <bot-t> [#9827] jQuery getScript .text and .async support (text: '{""parsetags"":""explicit""}' { async: true) - http://jqbug.com/9827
[06:23:00] <jaubourg> and hi
[06:25:48] <DaveMethvin> hi jaubourg
[06:26:03] <DaveMethvin> what are those google guys thinking???
[06:26:28] <DaveMethvin> just what we need, another exception
[06:26:47] <DaveMethvin> but i agree the "inline" type makes it clearer
[06:26:58] <DaveMethvin> of course ppl will bitch that they can't use $.getScript then
[06:27:45] <jaubourg> yeah, stupid decision, it also makes it impossible to load their lib using a script loader
[06:27:59] <jaubourg> (not with options at least)
[06:28:03] <DaveMethvin> which is a VERY common desire i'd think
[06:28:07] <jaubourg> indeed
[06:29:30] <jaubourg> so yeah, the inline type would make sense here... but I still dunno if we shouldn't rather ask google engineers to get back to their senses
[06:29:56] <DaveMethvin> it would be nice to talk with them in a dark alley
[06:29:57] <jaubourg> and seeing LinkedIn copy the technique makes me very anxious
[06:30:10] <jaubourg> this could spread very quickly :/
[06:30:30] <DaveMethvin> if google and linkedin are using it, it has already spread :(
[06:30:37] <jaubourg> never pictured you as the dark alley type... can I come with a camcorder?
[06:30:41] <jaubourg> ;)
[06:30:51] <DaveMethvin> lol
[06:31:22] <jaubourg> ok so this is an item we may wanna talk about at the next meeting
[06:31:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[06:31:36] <DaveMethvin> btw, did you have a meeting last week?
[06:31:41] <DaveMethvin> didn't see any notes
[06:31:42] <jaubourg> nope
[06:32:03] <DaveMethvin> we should have one on monday just to see what's up with 1.7
[06:32:03] <jaubourg> no John, no Adam, no you
[06:32:14] <DaveMethvin> yeah i was traveling
[06:32:28] <DaveMethvin> almost could have done it, they have sketchy wifi on the train
[06:32:43] <jaubourg> tell me about it, it's even worse in europe
[06:33:03] <DaveMethvin> well it's better than flying, b/c i have both wifi and phone to some extent
[06:33:03] <jaubourg> would be nice to have a "next meeting" tag in the bug tracker
[06:33:17] <DaveMethvin> you can always edit the core meeting notes to add it
[06:33:17] <jaubourg> that way we could easily track what we wanna talk about without having to edit a google doc
[06:33:27] <jaubourg> you typed faster :P
[06:33:38] <DaveMethvin> i had less to type
[06:33:44] <jaubourg> cheater!
[06:33:51] <DaveMethvin> stop talking so much!
[06:33:56] <jaubourg> no U
[06:34:12] <jaubourg> anyway, yes, this google technique is worrisome
[06:34:30] <jaubourg> after browser vendors, lib developpers and the madness goes on
[06:34:57] <DaveMethvin> and once it catches on, we get tickets like that saying "make it work with jQueryiess!!"
[06:35:06] <jaubourg> yep
[06:35:11] <DaveMethvin> WELL NOBODY ASKED US
[06:35:22] <jaubourg> on the other hand, if we support it in jQuery, then it'll spread even more
[06:35:27] <jaubourg> god I hate this position sometimes
[06:36:02] <jaubourg> I can see getify barging in and accusing *us* of forcing *him* to support it ;)
[06:36:02] <DaveMethvin> well if it doesn't work with script loaders it's worth talking to guys like rburke to see what they think
[06:36:08] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[06:36:36] <DaveMethvin> if they object then at least we have a reason to resist
[06:36:51] <jaubourg> it looks to me like a technique for static inline scripts being forced-fed in the dynamic injection world
[06:37:16] <jaubourg> static script tags in head rather
[06:37:20] <DaveMethvin> yep
[06:37:48] <jaubourg> thing is, support shouldn't necessitate that much work but... eeeeeeek
[06:38:02] <DaveMethvin> i had never seen that before the ticket, it had me wondering wtf he was talking about
[06:38:22] <DaveMethvin> especially since he didn't have a link to anything
[06:39:04] <jaubourg> that's not the first time I see that... but I always refused to work with libs that work that way... but now Google+ working like this? we're doomed
[06:40:04] <jaubourg> I'm almost tempted to provide a web-service that transforms the scripts in question to make them usable properly
[06:40:41] <jaubourg> http://urdoinitwrong.net/js/yourstupidscripthere.js
[06:41:09] <DaveMethvin> what was wrong with using the querystring?
[06:41:26] <DaveMethvin> i am not sure how this inline args stuff helps
[06:41:29] <jaubourg> cache miss
[06:41:47] <jaubourg> since the url is untouched, you always hit the cache
[06:42:01] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah
[06:42:08] <jaubourg> that's the only reason I can think of
[06:43:07] <jaubourg> but providing an initialization method/function would work just as good
[06:43:47] <DaveMethvin> but that would require JAVASSSCRIPTS jaubourg
[06:43:50] <jaubourg> they could simply setTimeout(...,0) their execution to wait and see if config is changed later on in the page
[06:44:08] <jaubourg> oh, silly me, asm javascript is evil, right
[06:45:13] <DaveMethvin> did you see docs#9895 jaubourg?
[06:45:15] <bot-t> [#9895] Memory Leak in fxqueue (new bug) - http://jqbug.com/9895
[06:45:40] <jaubourg> nope, didn't see it
[06:45:43] <DaveMethvin> someone at moz must have pm'ed john on it
[06:45:51] <DaveMethvin> it's using jquery tools
[06:46:00] <jaubourg> we still had inline regexp?
[06:46:06] <jaubourg> thought they were all in vars
[06:46:12] <DaveMethvin> that one is built dynamically
[06:46:17] <jaubourg> oh
[06:46:22] <DaveMethvin> it's a matcher for event namespaces
[06:46:40] <DaveMethvin> which jQuery Tools uses liberally
[06:46:55] <DaveMethvin> that code takes the logical out of pathological
[06:47:17] <jaubourg> hehe
[06:47:38] <jaubourg> maybe it has to do with the promise system introduced in 1.6 on anims?
[06:47:53] <jaubourg> does jQuery Tools use it?
[06:48:07] <DaveMethvin> or maybe it was out of focus and nothing ran b/c of requestAnimationFrame?
[06:49:28] <jaubourg> hahahaha, now that would be veeeeery funny
[06:49:51] <jaubourg> dunno if you follow the discussion I had with gnarf and timmy regarding raf?
[06:50:31] <jaubourg> gist of it was: "raf is perfect for rendering but we still need the timer to schedule animations and callbacks"
[06:50:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[06:50:44] <jaubourg> (my gist at least)
[06:51:17] <jaubourg> that's a conclusion I came to when trying my hands at supporting a css-animation like syntax
[06:51:24] <DaveMethvin> does seem like we have two concepts that might need to be pried apart
[06:51:28] <jaubourg> one "thread" to render, one "thread" to schedule
[06:52:55] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, i think that bug is due to rAF
[06:53:11] <DaveMethvin> in the play() method it's calling setInterval()
[06:53:54] <jaubourg> yeah, we broke a lot of stuff with raf
[06:54:48] <jaubourg> not sure I'm very happy with raf not being trigerred, even with a "do not render" flag, when browser is out of focus
[06:55:34] <DaveMethvin> well the concept is good ... don't run crap that nobody will see
[06:55:56] <DaveMethvin> the problem is the design of lots of code, including ours, conflates the scheduling with the animation
[06:56:33] <jaubourg> the problem is that we have code... I think raf was thought with CSS-centered mentality
[06:57:04] <jaubourg> the whole CSS transition/animation system is a nightmare from a js perspective really
[06:57:10] <DaveMethvin> good point, as soon as you say "run my code after the animation" things get ugly when the animation doesn't run
[06:57:31] <DaveMethvin> it really requires a rethink of animation designs
[06:57:38] <DaveMethvin> i don't think that is necessarily bad
[06:57:40] <jaubourg> are we sure the end of transition event is trigerred at the right time when browser is out of focus?
[06:57:49] <DaveMethvin> hellifino!
[06:58:23] <DaveMethvin> i do think we willl need to tackle this somehow
[06:58:30] <jaubourg> rethinking of animtion design won't cut it... it's just not feasible...people will go back to setTimeout madness and race conditions will be legion
[06:58:47] <DaveMethvin> well not just US rethinking but everyone rethinking
[06:58:54] <DaveMethvin> and an api that helps ppl do the right thing
[06:59:05] <DaveMethvin> uh... not sure how to do that tho :)
[06:59:23] <jaubourg> yeah, well, the only solution I can come up with is a secondary timer to schedule, really
[06:59:35] <DaveMethvin> just thinking about all those battery operated devices where you don't want to run stuff when it's out of focus or the screen is turned off
[07:00:00] <jaubourg> afaik, video and audio tag don't stop running when browser is out of focus
[07:00:19] <jaubourg> so try and sync with that and raf not being trigerred
[07:00:32] <DaveMethvin> the room is starting to spin ... :/
[07:00:45] <jaubourg> video may not be "rendered" but the audio is
[07:01:01] <jaubourg> so yeah, we need hard time constraints somehow
[07:01:11] <DaveMethvin> i wonder if rwaldron had to deal with that in popcorn.js
[07:01:36] <jaubourg> I think rick is video centered... he only relies on video events... that's what I would have done
[07:01:57] <jaubourg> but if a popcorn plugin uses an animation to show something... kaboom
[07:02:53] <jaubourg> that's the trick here... we've been needing proper timing for years now
[07:04:20] <jaubourg> xavier (our flash specialist @ creative area) told me this was all solved with "frames" in flash
[07:04:31] <jaubourg> no hard time constraints at all
[07:04:41] <jaubourg> though he was fuzzy about how audio was handled
[07:08:59] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: I cannot edit the core meeting document with my google apps account, sadly
[07:09:38] <jaubourg> k, gotta fly a little
[07:11:08] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg:  gimme some text
[07:11:10] <DaveMethvin> i will put it in
[11:30:24] <rwaldron> timmywil https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/442
[11:30:25] <rwaldron> <3
[11:32:04] <timmywil> rwaldron: cool
[15:00:18] <rwaldron> timmywil rworth I've updated that minimal license stuff
[15:00:30] <rwaldron> i closed the previous PR
[15:00:43] <rwaldron> and just created a new one, since the approach was completely different
[15:04:07] <rworth> rwaldron: looks like the date formats don't match
[15:04:54] <rworth> jquery.js has "Sat Jul 23 03:26:36 2011 +0200" while jquery.min.js has "Sat Jul 23 2011 18:03:58 GMT-0400 (EDT)"
[15:23:23] <rwaldron> ?tell rworth sorry i missed your message, ping me when you get back
[15:23:24] <bot-t> rwaldron, Okay.
