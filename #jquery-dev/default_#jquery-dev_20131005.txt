[00:30:08] <nate_black> hi all
[00:30:08] <nate_black> 01could someone help me with a little jquery problem please?01
[04:20:19] <lonejack> Hello everyone, I'm here to ask you for help about understanding some conceptual aspects about jquery. I am currently viewing a version 1.10.2 but what rigardano my points of interest I do not think things have changed in later versions.
[04:20:33] <lonejack> The line 60 I see the creation of jQuery (local): jQuery = function (selector, context) {..}.
[04:20:34] <lonejack> Subsequently the changes occurring in the prototype:
[04:20:34] <lonejack> jQuery.fn jQuery.prototype = ... =
[04:20:34] <lonejack> Please tell me one thing. "fn" is basically an abbreviation of the prototype right? This causes me a lot of doubts in that we have jQuery in which a parameter "fn" is equivalent to the prototype object.
[05:43:35] <scott_gonzalez> lonejack: Why does that give you doubts?
[05:43:43] <scott_gonzalez> It's just shorter to write.
[05:56:02] <lonejack> scott_gonzalez, I admit that js it isn't so simple as seems. As it happens in every learning process, the didactical is different from practice. When I read jQuery code there are many syntactical statement that puts on me many doubts. This is why sometime I came here. In order to have some confirmation. 
[05:56:02] <lonejack> Thank you, to you, for yours precious effort.
[05:57:56] <scott_gonzalez> To be honest, if I were fairly new to JavaScript, I wouldn't have doubts about the implementation of the most popular JS library. I'd have doubts about my understanding of the implementation.
[05:58:19] <scott_gonzalez> When I started using jQuery 6 six years ago, and I didn't understand the code, I didn't just assume that it was bad.
[05:58:26] <scott_gonzalez> I assumed that I didn't know what was going on.
[06:03:45] <lonejack> scott_gonzalez, english isn't my first tongue but what's onmy mind is exactly what you said.
[06:04:09] <lonejack> jquery is perfectly written
